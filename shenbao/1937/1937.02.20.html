<h3>蔣委員長昨晚廣播演講</h3>
<p>闡述新生活運動之意義　希望全國人民切實實行</p>
<p>［南京］新生活運動總會將會長中正、十九日晚在中央廣播電台廣播對新生活運動三週年紀念訓詞、全文如下、</p>
<p>諸位同胞、今天是新生活運動第三週年紀念日、我趁看這個機會、再來和諸位同胞補充説明新生活運動幾點重要的意義、第一、我們必須了解現在我們國家所處環境的惡劣、正是所謂內憂外患、紛至沓來、國難嚴重千鈞一髪的時候、我們若是不願束手待斃、必然負担起這個復興民族的責任來、復興民族的事業、不是個人的事業、亦不是一部份少數團體的事業、而乃是全國同胞人人之事、這個人人之事、如何纔能成功呢、簡單的講、是有二個要素、第一、就是使一般國民具備國民道德與他的精神、第二、要使一般國民具備國民智識與他的技能、道德愈高、精神愈强的國民、就容易使社會進步、智識愈廣、技能愈精的國民、就容易使生活提高、社會有進步、生活能提高、就是復興國家和民族的先决條件、新生活運動的推行、就是要做到這個地步來改良社會風氣、培養國家元氣、來造成我們救亡圖存復興民族的基礎、記念日的意義、本來就是要檢討過去的成績、來策勵將來的工作、在過去二年中、我常到各省市去視察、覺得在多處對於規矩清潔兩項、確有顯著的成效、至於改良農村、提倡國貨、注重衛生、推行儉約、亦有·相當成續、此外又有去夏所試辦的大學生暑期農村服務團、以及各地大中學生自動的組織暑期平民學校、雖然事屬創舉、但是有六十六個大學生代表、南京·上海·杭州·蘇州·的各大學利用暑假機會、參加農村普遍的義務工作、改進農民生活喚起農民對於國家和民族的觀念、同時學生也得到很多服務社會的經驗、和熟悉農民實際的生活、確是一舉兩得的工作、這是很可告慰的、但是我們不能以此為滿足我們新生活運動的推行、這不能達到所預定的目標、所以我把下列的幾點貢獻給推行新生活的各位伺志、（未完）（十九日中央社電）</p>

<h3>三中全會外記</h3>
<p>— 本報記者錢華</p>
<p>第五屆中央執行委員第三次全體會議自從十五日在首都開幕以來，業已經過了五天的會議，一大半的重要提案都已有了歸宿，現正極鄭重地起草閉幕宣言作一總結束。宣言起草委員會十八日曾經集議一次，就宣言經過一番縝密的討論，並決定由汪精衛氏主持起草事宜。這次大會適在綏戰勝利，西變解决之後召集，我破碎河山，如何逐步的修補，以達到還我完整的目的，關於陝局善後，和其他內部問題，如何可使全國意志趨於齊一，集合國力民力照一致的步驟，埋頭於救亡圖存的工作，在這些問題上，中委實在負荷着非常嚴重的責任，現在他們會集一堂來决定今後應付內外的國策，全國國民期望之殷，自無待言。</p>
<p>記者在大會期間，在首都觀光數天，從表面上看來，大會絲毫沒有緊張的空氣，這顯然是國民鎮靜功夫的表現但是各大飯店老闆却笑逐顏開，大小旅館都告客滿，中央委員一部份住在首都飯店，一部份住在中央飯店，其餘分散在公館，駐京辦公處，和華僑招待所裏。在開會時，大飯店裏很靜寂的像平時一樣，但在散會後，下午四五點鐘一直到晚上，飯店大門外排列着無數流綫型的汽車，裏面走廊上都擠滿了前往訪候的客人，眞是熱鬧萬分。平時飯店裏總是小房間容易出售，大房間老是空着，這次却適得其反，華貴一些的房間早就佔滿了，各中委有的率領了不少副官衛士，所以普通開兩間房，入帶得多一些的開三間。湖南省政府主席何鍵則開了六間大房，旅客板上一排何字，煞是好看。就這次出席的委員來講，比任何一屆來得踴躍，這正象徵着全國統一團結禦侮的氣勢。雖然全國矚目的軍政要目像閻錫山宋哲元贛復榘李宗仁白崇禧劉湘等等有病的有病，有事的有事，向大會請假，不克親來出席，未免美中不足，但是都派有極重要的全權代表，在會外接洽，跟親臨也差不了多少。</p>
<p>現在要説到新聞事業的本身了。這次大會對於新聞的關防，比任何一屆來得嚴密。大會開會的時候，中央黨部附近佈置特別警備綫，第一步先要領得車輛特別通行證，否則就不能越雷池一步。第二步則需要入會場的特別證章，不然也祇能望門興嘆，連中央黨部的職員也得照章辦理。而這種通行證和證章，新聞記者是沒有領取權利的。也以會場內外絕對沒有新聞記者的足跡。從前新聞記者雖然不能到會場旁聽，但是外面却有一問記者招待室，散會和照相的時候還可以和各委晤面；自從前年汪先生過刺事情發生後，記者與要人間無形的有了很深的阻隔，這次大會當然更不能例外，大會新聞由秘書處擬好了交中央社發表，一方面確省了報館方面不少的人力和財力，但是有許多報館還派了人來，祇好在會後分頭找幾位出席委員，獲得一鱗半爪的消息。某委員含笑對記者説，報界老是抱着有聞必錄的觀念，其實這是錯悮的。問了還要辨別是非，加以選擇，然後方予刋綠，有的時候一個人人在會場上激於一時的情威衛動，發表了一篇説話，假使报紙寫上把他記載出來，事情或由小化大。假使一字不載，就能由小事變無事了。所以有的時候新聞還是少登一些的好。你們也省事，政府也省事云。像這樣無事哲學，是我國本位文化的一端，和平息爭都從此點做起，確有至理。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國增防香港</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>據日來路透社所傳消息。英政府對於香港的防禦。近來忽加以甚大的注意。在去年十一月至十二月中香港的海陸空電曾有長期的演習倫敦方面所傳在香港建築新營房的費用。達一百十萬鎊之鉅。本月十八日香港電。又傳英當局已在香港南部史丹萊半島。劃定二方英里為軍事區域。建築秘密砲壘。另據十六日電訊。在下月中旬香港將有最大規模的防禦演習海陸空軍均參與其中將包括陸軍二千五百人全部中國海面的艦隊二十五艘從新加坡開來的陸軍一千人及飛船一中隊另有島上的防空部隊與新成立的海軍志願隊。不久以前英軍在新加坡曾有大規模的演戰。現在香港又顯示了同樣的軍事活動。這在遠東的形勢發展中究竟含有怎樣的意義呢。</p>
<p>香港與新加坡同為英國在遠東的重要軍事根據地。就它們原來的地位説香港的重要實較甚於新加坡。不過由於一九二二年華盛頓海軍條約的訂立規定香港在不設防的范圍之內。所以英國就以新加坡作為遠東軍事上的重心。但在去年年底華府條約已由日本的聲明廢止而失效。太平洋上不設防的規定也歸於取消。於是在太平洋上不安定的風浪中英國又開始把它的海上軍事活動從新加坡伸展到香港來了。</p>
<p>英國的積極增防香港主要當是由於三種動機。第一是日本經濟勢力的漸向南太平洋推進。現在英國在香港馬來亞與印度的市場差不多大部分已被日本奪去。這種情形使蘭開夏的資本家感受很大的威脅。市場的爭奪很容易發展成為領土的爭奪的。於是英國的殖民地當局不能不趁早籌備着防禦了。第一是日本軍事勢力的南進。現在確已漸趨顯明。台灣的海空軍港的發展。南洋委任統治羣島軍事建業的秘密進行。關於暹羅運河開鑿權的陰謀獲取。興日本對於我們海南島的垂涎。都足以引起英國軍事當局的恐慮。所以這次香港的增強防禦。在英日兩大勢力的鬥爭上。其意義也是非常顯明的。第三則是整個遠東局勢的發展所引起英國的積極重視。一九三六年中英國外交當局曾經幾次探取日本關於遠東妥協的意見結果都歸於失敗。而十一月底日德同盟的成立。更給興英國在遠東的地位以嚴重的打擊。由於這種廣大的國際外交上的推動。英國對於遠東的政策。似乎已有逐慚的改變。特別是在對華對美與對蘇聯的關係上。英國已多少拋棄過去保守黨“死硬派”的褊狹態度而改取友善的協作政策這種政策的推進自然也足使香港的地位漸增重要自從去年粵漢路完成通車以來由香港至英倫。差不多已造成全世界最長的鐵道聯絡綫。而汎美公司的橫渡太平洋航空綫。在下月二十四日。也將直達香港。與中國航空公司的路綫相銜接。這種種都足以顯示香港在今後遠東交通與國際合作上的重要我們希望英國當局能根據這種政策上的轉變。進一步促成太平洋上集體安全的聯結。共同反對那最大的侵略者</p>
<h3>國防公債案英下院表决通過</h3>
<p>首相力為政策辯護　充實軍備防止侵略　國聯機構締造和平</p>
<p>［倫敦］英政府發行國防公債四萬萬鎊之計劃、今日在下院討論時、雖在工黨與自由黨反對之下、但終能以三百二十九票對一百四十五票之大多數通過、此事經首相包爾溫為政府政策作奮激之辯護後、即開始投票表决、事前工黨及反對派自由黨均曾表示、將投票反對之、</p>
<p>包爾溫於辯論詞中稱、此項支出唯一之目的、即在使國家賓力、能達到可以保障不列顚及帝國安全之標準、“俾得於世界和平之維護盡其綿薄”、包氏復稱、現在國家之財力儘可施行是項計劃、不致危及社會事業、亦不致使物價有過分漲落、而影響人民之生活程度、包氏復重述外相艾登之言、即英國之軍力、將永不作侵略之用、僅可為防衛帝國及被侵略者而行使之、今各黨派莫不以維護和平為目的、而政府前此已於國聯機構中、竭力締造和平、倘不幸而失敗、則政府固不能承受失敗為最後之終局也、惟政府迄今尚未放棄和平之希望及目的、目前所努力者、即欲與舊洛迦諾條約諸國訂立新協約、以代舊洛迦諾條約、</p>
<p>據包氏之意見、最近將來最大之希望、即區域協定之訂立、包氏繼稱、近二三年來召致歐洲不安之最大原因、即英國之負担及責任興其實力缺乏均衡、蓋即在集體安全中、苟欲稍盡綿薄、亦必先具維護自身之能力、包氏深信倘西歐能成立互助條約、則和平必能維持、否則一旦破裂、則“當吾之前者、將為歐洲一等之軍事及空戰國家”云、且英國在東方亦有領土存在、英國一方面在海上應有自顧之能力、但倘不幸之事、逾越此範圍、英國亦必須有自顧之能力也、倘英國無與他國積極合作、或自善其身之能力、則加入集體安全實亦至危險之事、故政府今日提出之主張、即在避免此種危險、“今夕吾人所討論者、即關係吾人之安全及人民之安全者”云、</p>
<p>反對黨之質問</p>
<p>反對黨開始辯論發言者、為前海相亞歷山大、其言之要點如下、㊀軍備程序之所以需之者、蓋由政府在已往數年外交政策範圍中坐失許多機會故也、㊁政府現已獲得擬請國會通過所需經費之正當價值一節、並無左證、㊂舉債以充此項經費之辦法、殊背穩固財政之道、穩固財政即政敵所用以為反抗一九三一年麥唐納政府之武器也、</p>
<p>殷斯基浦答辯</p>
<p>次調整國防大臣殷斯基浦爵士起稱、渠見發言人無一曾問及星期二日白皮書中所載軍備程序之任何項者、殷氏又答亞歷山大之問話、謂俟概算書提交下院時，下院自將有保衛經濟之充分機會、</p>
<p>政府外交政策</p>
<p>殷氏對於外交政策、引述一月十九日外相艾登所發演説中之言曰、“政府現正積極從事戰門事務之重整武備、吾人深覺此舉、為達吾人目的所不能不行者、惟此舉本身、並非吾人之目的、蓋今尚待談判歐洲之解决、與鞏固國聯之權威也、吾人準備於政治綏靖與經濟合作之共同工作與列強合作”</p>
<p>軍事計畫四項</p>
<p>殷氏於是乃述及星期三日下院辯論時、評詆政府程序中缺乏眞正之調整一節、舉所已議妥之四種計劃為證、海陸空軍於此四種計劃均相合作、渠希望藉此可减輕民衆對此之憂慮、㊀海濱防務問題曾經通盤研究、而注重各口岸之易受海上或天空攻擊一點、各個口岸在近代狀况下所需之實在防務、曾經詳定辦法、而與各地當局討論各種武器之分配事宜、㊁全國防空問題、不特會由海陸空軍專家、且由有關係各部之專家詳加研究、已達以應需保護給予各特殊地點之精確程度、經此研究之結果、已决定防務應需經費之總數興性質、俾白皮書所提此之經費、得依精密之籌畫為根據、㊂軍火之積儲，㊃工業之潛能性</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>事變所獲敎訓</p>
<p>殷氏繼謂下院恐尚未悉政府對於各工廠制造武器與了彈之能力、會作遷澈之調查、例如政府曾查知陸軍某種需要確有缺點、乃即從事補救、而在泰恩河與辦機務工程、俾出產能力可應付緊急時之任何需求、至於更高的軍略事宜、殷氏欣然群述海陸空軍專家自己經營或在帝國防務委員會下經營所得之經驗啟發與情報、並述及曾注意上年因東西地中海事變所得之敎訓一點、殷氏又舉渠部中所會組織與協力研究之數種重要問題、即糧食之輸入·戰時運輸之改造·各口岸與內地運輸之組織·戰時口糧之發給·糧食之屯積·原料之儲存是、</p>
<p>殷氏於原料之存儲一點、謂政府曾及時而興、於軍械製造所需之重要材枓、曾籌劃儘量存儲、殷氏繼曰、諸君不能就細小之道估量安全、凡值得負其名義之任何政府、終當以决定無外國能制服吾人為其職責、英國不可侵犯之信用、實為其無價之寶云</p>
<p>與自治領關係</p>
<p>殷氏殊不以反對黨批評自治領政府之政策為然、彼稱“本年在召集帝國會議之時、吾人儘有興各自治領域政府之代表磋商之機會、屆時自治領域政府之政策、應由其代表陳述之、吾人殊不能强之使同受吾人之束縛也”、至反對黨所稱不列顚代自治領域償付防守之代價一節、殷氏稱、“吾人所以必使政府代帝國某某等地之殖民地及屬地、償付共防守費用者、因此等地方、本在吾人責任範圍之中、並因吾人方恃此等地方為原料之資源也、且自治領域、亦自覺其與不列顚聯繫之價值、彼等為自身之安全、用自身之金錢作自身之準備”云、</p>
<p>工黨再起發言</p>
<p>殷斯基浦爵士詞畢、工黨議員威治伍特繼之發言、威氏稱倘英國有何危害、危害必來自德國、故“吾人必須慮及與法俄兩國同盟之需要”、威氏復謂西班牙之戰、英國在雙方均應遣人視察戰事最近乏進展、而避免軍備之糜費、威氏稱工黨之所以反對此項軍費者、並非該黨對於國家及民主政治及全世界之勞工階級不願盡其保護之責、而因對於此種工具究竟能否取得和平、尚不無懷疑云、工黨議員克利浦斯繼稱、彼承認軍備之需要、因目前工黨認國社黨為第一公敵、但英國人民苟欲獲得反對國社主義之保障、必須先以管理外交政策及軍力之權授諸勞工政府云、工黨議員孟特於是即表示反對派工黨、對於此次國防公債之議案、將投否决之票云、(中央社十九日路透電)</p>
<h3>英國擴張海軍美將急起直追</h3>

<h3>統一救國的眞詮</h3>
<p>— 柳湜</p>
<p>“所謂中國人民陣綫的眞相及其理論的檢討”的檢討；求教於駱奐美先生</p>
<p>在半月以前，就聽説南京某報上登載過一篇批評“中國人民陣綫”的文字，內中涉及了我；我當時非常懷疑，我想，我一向沒有談過什么“中國人民陣綫”，為什麼會有人把我扯入呢！那一定是朋友們看錯了，并不相信眞是事實。那時因為不知那篇文章發表在南京的那一家報上，無法去找原文，頗感一些失望，但不久也就將這一傳説忘記了。</p>
<p>廢歷新年，因為應一位親戚的邀請，到蘇州去看了一次梅花，雖然梅花還少開放，並無探梅雅事，但幾日作客之身，就連每天的報紙也沒有好好看過。回到上海，才從朋友處聽到那篇批評中國人民陣綫的文章，又於二月十五，十六，十七日的申報上重新登出，題名是“所謂中國人民陣綫的眞相及其理論的檢討”確實涉及了我，並派我作了“聯合的理論家”。我聽了這消息後，眞是喜上心來，急忙就向舊報紙堆中去尋覓這三天的申報，果能如願覓得，眞是三生有幸，我始知我久仰慕的教言，原來是駱奐美先生賜與的。</p>
<p>一口氣將駱先生的“檢討”讀完，我只覺得駱先生可惜是白費氣力了。因為駱先生檢討的是“中國人民陣綫”，但是今日中國並沒有人倡言“人民陣綫”，那末，駱先生之所謂“眞相”，自然並不是“眞”，因此也就更説不上什麼“理論”和“檢討”了。關二涉及我個人的部分，在我只覺萬分歉然，我既與“中國人民陣綫無關，一向又從未談過‘中國人民陣綫’的話，事實勝於雄辯，我又何必費辭呢；本來，像駱先生這次的“檢討”是撲了一個空的，用不着也再來“檢討”，但當此統一救國聲浪正高之時，駱先生這樣的言論事買上會妨害統一的偉業，對于統一救國的眞義尚是糢糊的民衆，是非常有害的，因此覺得仍不能不出而辯證，想來，在全國上下正在結成鐵的團結的今日，還不是完全的費辭罷。</p>
<p>首先我要誠懇的要求駱先生及與駱先生有同感的友人們抑住自己的感情一些，在討論國事時，千切不要略帶一點意氣。我們知道能説服人的只有眞理，最殘酷的辯證是當前的事實。今日中國的“國運危急”，誠如上海各界統一救國大同盟二月十六夜發佈的宣言中所云，非全國統一，無以阻“敵人之侵略”，“進而收復失地，非全國統一亦無能挽救農村，以言建設，非和平的“完成國家眞正的統一，無以救國”，這些話都是反映了全國民衆最大的要求，最普遍的願望。去歲兩廣專變，西安之變，政府都能做到和平解決，我們不能否認這是政府顧到民意，在執行人民的意志，我們不能不受感動。同時這也説明了全國人民如何的在期望統一，期望和平。但統一並非空言，所謂統一，是因為承認國內尚有分裂，彼此對立。我們如果諱言現實中的分裂，對立，那不是誠意的談統一，如果根本否認國內有分裂對立的事實，既然現實是“一”了，那更用不着言“統一”我們惟其有地分裂，我們要求“統一”，促“統一”之道並不只有一條，過去已有人用過武力去求“統一”，但我們得到的教訓是用武力求統一，在這統一過程中，雙方都有力的消耗，只是對消國力，不足以管“集中國力”，所以人民的要求，並不主張武力統一，而傾向和平統一的道路，今日不談救國則已，如談救國，自己要做一個“眞正愛國的中國人”，如果從反對統一救國，那他不是漢奸，就是白癡。如果他再主張武力統一救國，那他不是昧於國內政治形勢，廣大的人民的要求，就是別有用心名。和平的統一應該作什麼解釋呢！（未完）</p>

<p>主席報告畢、由吳指導員鐵城代表章淵若致詞、略謂、“今天為新生活運動三週紀念日、各界代表在此舉行盛大紀念會、吳市長為本會指導員、本擬親自出席、適以赴京出席三中全會、不克分身、故由淵若代表、并致蕪詞、新生活運動有幾個重大的意義、第一是生活的革命運動、第二是新國民的建設運動、第三是民族的復興運動、就第一點來説、世界各國的革命、各有其特殊的意義、有政治革命、有產業革命、有社會革命、中國的國民革命、因為歷史背景、民族精神、時代需要、與社會條件的不同、却含有多樣不同的意義、不但有政洽革命、產業革命、社會革命的綜合性、並且還有心理革命與生活革命的副作用、一九三四年在南昌發動的新生活運動、便是一種國民生活的革命運動、這種革命最初的意義、雖僅是道德的精神的、但其終極的目標、及其相應而至的效果、却與社會改造、政治革新、經濟建設、都有莫大的關係、就第二點來説、新生活運動、是一種新國民的建設運動、革命的目的、並不僅限於上層的外物的破壤、尤重在基本的內心的改造、一個國家建立的條件、也不僅限於物質的發展、而尤貴乎國民精神的砥勵、中國雖是一個歷史最悠久的文化民族、但是現在一般國民的思想精神、生活習慣、却是頹廢不振、凌亂散漫、實無以應付世變、與人爭存、新生活運動、一方面以我國固有的道德為基準、使國民平時的生活要合乎禮義廉恥的精神、一方面復以生活合理化為原則、要使一切生活的行動、合乎“整齊清潔、簡單樸素、迅速確實”的條件、實在是一種訓練現代新國民之基本建設運動、就第三點來説、新生活運動、又是一種民族的復興運動、新生活運動最高目標、在求國民生活的軍事化·生產化·和藝術化·提倡藝術化·改造粗野橫暴卑鄙齷齪的行為、所以求國民生活的高尚、提倡生產化、改造國民盜竊爭取、怠惰茍安的行為、所以求國民生活的富足、提倡軍事化、改造散漫凌亂、畏難懦怯的行為、所以求國民生活的鞏固、一個民族的生活、如果在國防上能夠鞏固、在物質上能夠富足、在精神上又能高尚、這種民族、無疑的必能在國際上爭取其優越的地位、在人羣進化的軌轍上、發展其無限悠久偉大的生命、新生活運動的意義、固如此深刻偉大、但新生活運動的眞諦、尚不在此、因為、新生活運動的哲學基礎、在“行”而不在“知”、新生活運動的基本要義、貴實踐而不尚空談、新生活運動的指導原則、大家都知道是禮義廉恥、禮義廉恥、並不是什麼新奇的道理、乃是一種傳統的思然、是我國固有的道德文明的結晶、因此我們提倡新生估運動、實在用不着在理論上去多所闡發、徒事空談、而是貴從實際上去切寶推行、尤其要從各人本身上去身體力行、</p>
<p>我們中國民族素以精神文明自炫、素以禮義之邦自負、中國幾千年來的統治階級以及文人學者、也莫不以禮義廉恥為治國教民的極則、但是終數千年來空言標榜的結果、非但禮義蕩然、廉恥掃地、而且因為紀律精神組織能力的不如人、竟遭“後起之邦”的非笑、這並不是因為我們沒有教化、而是因為我們先聖先哲所給我們的治國教民的道理、祇成了空洞的口説、而未能演為實際的行動、致任何高深的理論、都不能改造實際的生活、所謂禮義廉恥、祇成了口頭上標榜的空話、而未能成為生活上奉行的信條、因此幾千年來聖賢教民的道理、因為一般假衛道的學者、知而不行、却並未發生任何治理國家、推進社會的實際功效、五四時候、有人高呼“打倒吃人的禮教、其實禮教何嘗會吃人、祇是因為知‘行’脫節、以致所謂禮教、早已失却了聖道的眞諦、所以、當明末清初的時候、有一位顏習齊先生、早就對於那些空談性理、誤解聖道的偽學者、痛加抨擊、認為他們的罪惡、寶誤盡蒼生、為禍之烈、較秦始皇焚書坑儒為尤甚、顏習齋説、泛濫章句、不是聖道、競尚清談、尤非聖學、聖學的眞諦、要教民“習事”、故曰、“學而時習之”、“力行近乎仁”、“習”“行”二字、乃為聖學之眞諦、亦為貫澈聖道的基本工夫、新生活運動、要以固有的禮義廉恥的道德原則、貫澈到衣食住行的實際生活中去、實最合聖學的眞諦、實最足貫澈聖道的精神、所以、新生活運動、絕對不是清談的、而是實際的、不是虛浮的、而是實幹的、不是空言的、而是力行的、新生活運動的眞諦、及其基本的要件、乃在、表裏一致、言行一致、心口如一、知行合一、數千年來、中國先聖先賢、治國教民的原則、實已美不勝收、却都成了點綴的空言、而未發為切實的行動、晚近以來、一般志士仁人、奔走救國的行動、尤為轟轟烈烈、盛極一時、却都祇有一時的興奮、而未有持久的力量、僅見一二領袖的提倡、而未為一般民衆所奉行、此中失敗的原因、雖極複雜、概括言之、實由於虛浮不務實際、以致言行不能一致、知行不能合一、一切完美的理論、俱不能發為現實的力量、新生活運動的領導者、在負起其時代的使命、推動看這一個運動的輪軸、統率着整個民族、向前邁進的時候、更應深深地記取這一個歷史的教訓、不要重蹈以往的覆轍、當新生活運動週年紀念的時候、我曾提出三個希望、第一希望、政府方面、要明定賞罰、振肅紀綱、第二希望、社會方面、要明辨是非、擁護公道、第三希望、個人方面、要以身作則、眞誠力行、這三個希望、當然都是新生活運動成功的必要條件、並且都有其連帶關係、便是第三點却尤為三者之本、因為新生活運勁、從最切實的意義來講、實在又是一種自覺自新的運動、他的本旨、乃是要砥礪每一個國民的精神、使其自愛·自重·自尊·自覺·自強·自新·成為一個努力向上、奮發有為自强不息、日新又新的國民、所以我希望每個新生活運動的倡導者或信仰者、還得先從自我改造、自我訓練、自我修養、自我努力、自我實踐做起、這樣、新生活運動才能推已及人、由近及遠、得到切實而普遍的成效、</p>
<p>李廷安等先後演説</p>
<p>吳指導員代表致詞後、由李局長廷安致詞、略謂、今日為新生活運動三週紀念、關於新生活運動之意義、已由主席及指導員代表闡述甚詳、本人就觀感所及、與諸君略述之、新生話運動中所提倡之整潔一事、似甚簡易、而關係極為重大、整潔在個人、是求取個人健康的起點、整潔在事業、是求取事業取宏效的起點、整潔在國家社會、是求取國家社會有紀律有秩序的起點、我們在新生活運運的一切綱領中、覺得無一不重要的、總之、新生活運動是復興民族的要素、所以我們必須嚴格奉行、末由潘公展局長代表張秉輝致詞、略謂、因為新生活運動、對於國家民族關係之重大、所以一定要新生活推行到一般民間去、現在社會局不但使各學校一律奉行新生活運動、同時對於工農商各界都設法喚起他們的注意、末呼口號散會、</p>
<p>下午分為四組視察</p>
<p>本市新運促進會、於下午分四組至各機關·各學校·各團體視察實施新生活近况、將視察情形彙製報告存會、各機關學校團體年來推行新運頗為積極、故收效甚佳</p>

<h3>統一與和平（續）</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>既然大家需要和平，我們怎樣去求和平呢？統一。惟有統一可以求得和平。為什麼？要解答這問題，先要知道不和平打仗的原因在那裏。不和平而打仗的原因是由於割據。東也割據，西也割據，你想做這地方的領袖，他也想做那地方的霸王，各自稱雄，互不相讓，於是發生戰爭。自辛亥革命以後到民國二十年“九一八”為止，為什麼年年不斷的戰爭呢？歸根結底的説，就因為割據的力量蠢蠢欲動，此伏彼起。這種傳統的封建觀念和割據思想沒有造變，我們的國家當然不能和平。各位都讀過本國史，都知道這種情形呌做羣雄割據。三國志演義的開場白説：“天下大勢，分久必合，合久必分，”這八個字可以包括了中國數千年來的歷史。我們希望以後不再如此，就是希望合則永合，不要再分，根據以往的歷史，凡是遇到分的時期，一定是戰亂頻年，天災人禍，民不聊生；凡是到了合的時期，一定是國運昌隆，聲威遠震。我們試看漢武帝的時代，國家是有何等威望。再看唐太宗時代，國家又是何等的尊嚴？反之五胡十六國的時代，中國怎樣？南北朝的時候，中國怎樣？羣雄割據，則生民塗炭；國家一統，則文教遠播。所以我們要求和平，一定先要統一。李世民統一之後，才有唐初貞觀的盛世；朱元璋統一之後，才有明初洪武的治平。歷史的教訓明明白白告訴我們，我們的國家要求和平祇有統一，統一之後才可以得到和平；除了精神喪失常態之外，决沒有人説分裂才可以和平。</p>
<p>照我這樣的解釋，和平與統一是不相等了。要和平是找們的目的。用什麽方法達到我們的目的？用统一的方法來求得和平。所以和平是目的，统一是方法。用統一的方法來求得和平，才是眞正的和平，才是長久的和平。誰也不敢保證和平是永遠的，不過我們總希望和平能夠維繫得較為長久。假使不是用眞正統一的方法求得和平，那是粉飾的，紙糊的假和平，不久就要戳穿的。譬如兩廣事變以後，大家以為和平了，而詎知還有西安之變，可見不做到眞正的統一，决無眞正的和平。</p>
<p>日本明治維新以後為什麼能夠和平？要知道在維新以前，日本也是曾經衰亂的，同現在的中國一樣，受着不平等條約的束縛，西方帝國主義的壓迫，甚至於他的地位還不如當時的中國。為什麼維新以後，六七十年之間能夠轉變到今日的地位呢？其基礎完全建築於明治維新時期的廢藩運動、從前日本的國家大權分散在藩閥手中，這無異是割據。因為有了廣藩運動，把掌握於割據的藩閥手中的權力集中到中央，然後國家因王權的建立而統一了。因為國家統一，然後才能和平，才能强盛，才能走上現代國家的舞台。所以廢藩運動就是日本明治維新的統一救國運動。他如俾斯麥輔佐威廉一世建立德意志聯邦，就是德意志的統一救國運動；瑪志尼，加富爾，加里波的三傑的建立意大利王國，就是意大利的統一救國運動。歷史具在，都可覆按。</p>
<p>説到日本，為什麼能夠促進這個廢藩運動呢？大家都知道明治維新是學西洋的新法，但是他站在什慶基礎上去學西洋的新法呢？老實説，他是從漢學的基礎上去學四洋新法。所謂漢學基礎，就是中國明季大儒王陽明先生的學問。日本把這種學問做了復興的基礎，本着尊王攘夷的精神，去擁護，皇抵抗外侮，就在這四個字的精神之下復興起來。“尊王攘夷”是日本所固有的精神嗎？不是。這是中國固有的寶貝。孔子修春秋，微言大義，所表現的精神，就是尊王攘夷的精神。因為時當周衰，諸侯强盛，王室式微，所以孔子就鼓吹尊王。春秋所以大書春王正月，就是尊奉周王的正朔。所謂“攘夷，”就是抵抗外來的夷狄。孔子對於管仲，會有數度不客氣的批評，如“管仲之器小哉！”管氏而知禮，孰不知禮？等等，但是有一次孔子却慨嘆着：“微管仲，吾其照髮左袵矣，”所以説他“如其仁！如其仁！”什麼仁呢？就是九合諸侯一匡天下的仁，也就是“尊王攘夷”的仁。可見“尊王攘夷”是中國固有的寶貝，日本眞能學得這種精神，所以能復興。</p>
<p>諸位不要以為我在這裏翻古董，專制的王現在固然已經沒有了，可是個國家總有一個“中央”的，現在我們不能説“尊王，”可是我們應該説統一於中央。現在國際平等，環　棣通，不能再説攘夷，但是“抗敵”可説的罷。那麼攘夷就是抗敵。假使外國人不做我們的敵人，當然應該做朋友；假使他一定要做我們的敵人，我們就必須抗。所以用現代術語來講，“尊王”就是“統一，“攘夷”就是“抗敵。”我們也要本着這四個字的精神來復興中華民族。日本明治維新就是一個很好的榜樣。</p>
<p>須知“尊王攘夷”這四個字不能顚倒的。從字面上看，尊王攘夷與攘夷尊王似乎並無不同，而實際上這順序是含有至理的。必尊了王才能攘夷，必內部統一才能抵抗外敵，這是天經地義。我再來引申一句話，統一是安內，抗敵是攘外，一定要先安內而後攘外。統一了得到和平的結果，這是安內；和平了才能蓄積力量抗敵，這是攘外。故統一之後的抗敵，才是眞正的抗敵，才是有力量抗敵，這也是顚撲不破的眞理。</p>
<p>現在再來檢討中國近百年來的情形怎樣。這百年來的歷史告訴我們，不必埋怨什麼人，因為這是中國歷史演義的必然性。須知辛亥革命為什麼成功這樣快？固然靠革命主義的宣傳，但是在清末，排滿和三民主義還是靠秘密宣傳，知道的人不一定多，為什麼武昌起義之後，不久中華民國就成立了呢？是因為中國在沒有走上資本主義的生產制度以前，代表地主紳士的地方割據勢力推翻中央王權運動的成功。據有眼光的歷史學者和社會學者的研究，自秦始皇統一中國之後，商業資本一天天發達，使得農村生產低落，農民失業，到了相當時期，失業農民加多，沒有辦法，於是發生農民暴動。而此農民暴動可以使已經久合的局面重行分裂，變成羣雄割據。割據之後再求統一，又成為合的局面。所以數千年來的歷史，都在這“合久必分，分久必合”六個字當中循環已不下七八去了。滿清末年革命的迅速成功，可以説多半是靠了這個歷史的循環。</p>

<h3>怎樣應付子女的教育費？</h3>
<p>— 張宛青</p>
<p>寒假易逝，轉眼又是開學的時候，這時，我想無輪那個作父母的，只要不是“貧無立錐”之地，恐怕沒有一個不為正在學齡時的子女們作交納學費上的打算吧！</p>
<p>所謂“學費”，不過是“教育費”的一個籠統的名稱。子女“年幼”，或是“走讀”，那麼只消交出一筆“學費”，別的費用，便可以在日用方面和其他的費用攪在一起，不必另外“分門別類”。可是，這究竟不是個妥善的辦法。要知道，子女的年齡是在“與日俱增”，而子女的教育費用，不是“與日俱升”。在父母方面的收入，眼前固可以安然渡過，然而可知其將來怎樣？所以，最好的方法，還是“防患於未來”，這裏，筆者有幾個盡人皆知，而盡人“不能行”或“不欲行的方法，再提出來，請大家注意一下。</p>
<p>一，新婚後的凖備尚新婚的夫婦們在組織了小家庭後，燕兩餘，萬不可忘的，便是為“未出世的子女作計畫”。因為每一時新婚的夫婦，他們的子女在什麼時候來，連他們自己也不知道，甚或以為無關緊要。要知道，與其“臨渴掘井”，何如“未雨綢繆”。所以，凡是新婚的夫婦，在自己日用預算表內，應該把“將來子女的教育費”用一項列入，那麼，每月在月終結算的時候，便可以將這筆欵項，儲人妥實的銀行中去·至於欵數，並不要一定，可按自己當時的情形而定，入欵多則多儲，入欵少則少儲，到年終時，再總結算一次，結算後，就可拿來作“凖期”的儲欵，以後無論如何，以“不挪用”為凖則。如此，到子女出生的時候，必是一筆很可觀的數目。倘不幸而無“子息”，那麼，年年儲存，將此欵移為“老年時之養老金”，亦不無小補的·</p>
<p>二，子女出生後之凖時儲金子女在卽生後，作父母的，就必得每月應有一定的數目儲入銀行，儲時，可以當時收入之最低情形而定，因為如果過多、也許將來在自己收入較少時，以致不能繼續。定期十年或十五年均可。每月儲入，不得間斷，這樣，到子女到了中學用欵較多的時期，父母就不必再担心，或是説：“沒有錢，不用念書了！”</p>
<p>三，平時預儲這是比較上述兩項中，最次的一種。因為未有子女或子女幼小，都可不要犯愁，然而子女是大起來了，花用多了，既不曾在未有子女的時代作凖備，又不曾在子女卽生之後作計劃，那麼，“急抱佛腳”，也只有這一條路可走。</p>
<p>方法是這樣。按着每天過去的開支大約數目，然後再詳細預核，在每月柴，米，油，鹽，醬，醋，茶，以及其他的費用內，每月撙節若干，作為教育費用。甯可茶少喝點，油少用點，麻雀牌少叉點，脂粉少抹點，但這筆子女的“教育費”，却萬不可少！每月“將多餘之錢，存入銀行，到了秋季或是春季子女在上學交費的時候。作父母的，就不必再哭喪着臉，向各方求爺告娘的“借”“貸”了。</p>
<h3>現代婦女的寂寞生活</h3>
<p>— 芝雲</p>
<p>倫敦晚報，近刊載心卽學家馬迪夫人，發表一文，題為“現代婦女”。她説，在若干和我討論心理問題的現代婦女中，其中有一位，最引起着我的注意，因為她説，“實在閒得無事可做”。</p>
<p>在那些事情忙得來不及做的婦女們，聽了她的説話，都不由的好笑起來。但是我得奉勸“事情忙得來不及做的婦女們，該哀憐着‘實在閒得無事可做’的婦女。以前有一位‘閒得無事可做’的婦人，是某省城裏的推事夫人。她説，她的閒適的生活，使她感到了極度的乏味，而覺得這樣的生活下去，太無價值。她覺得這麼生活着，是很可恥的，但她却不能具體的指出對於生活上的那一點不滿意。她的婚姻，是很愉快的。她的二個兒子，也很好，身心都很健全。但是在這優越的環境中，她是時常的感到不快，因為她是感到了無事可做的寂寞。雖然她和丈夫的感情很好，但她的丈夫，是整天的在外工作的。她所有的嗜好，是玩哥而夫球，但並不精擅。在從前，她的二個兒子，累得她相當的忙碌，但自從兒子進入學校之後，她是閒下來了，家事與交際，僅佔有着她的時間中的一小部分，而她又別無嗜好，所以她是常希望着休假日的到來。因為在休假日，她是合家的往郊外小別墅中遊息的。她是生長在鄉間的，所以對於庭園的興味極濃。到後來，她得了丈夫的同意，索性住居到了這郊外的別墅中，於是她才回復了她的生活興趣，因為她在庭園中，找到了工作了。</p>
<p>在這一個例子中，似乎問題的發生與解决，都是再也簡單不過的，但是在目前，在這公式之下，實在閒得無事可做的婦女，正不知有着多少呢。這是現代文化之下，所產生的現象，大家想做現代婦女的結果。她們雖有家庭工作可做，但是她們都不高興做，而在若干組織與職業圈中，又深閉固拒着她們的闖入。於是她們便旁皇着，無事可做，然而假使她們能各依其天然的嗜好，而自己去找尋出路，任何人都不用愁着不能得到幸福的生活。在機器生產，影響生活標凖之前，婦女生活，是僅限於家庭之中。但是在現代呢，妻子的或是母親的生活，已退到了全部生活中的一部分的地位了。她們都想做一個比了她們的姊娣，或母親，較為快樂的婦女。她們都想把其餘的時間，應用到比了家庭工作更有價值的社會生活上面去，於是乎造成了閒得無事可做的可笑的結果了。雖然有一部分人，果然是安於閒適，但大部分，都是極度的感到寂寞與失望，而意識着她們不是在生活，簡直是在挨日子。</p>
<p>譯者按，這篇文章，言簡意賅，雖然作者是對英國婦女説的，然而也不啻對於我國的現代婦女們，痛下針砭。我相信，我國的現代婦女們，也正多着“實在閒得無事可做”的呢。</p>
<h3>孕婦的常識</h3>
<p>— 震亞</p>
<p>一個懷了孕的女子應否暫時向社會告退而去躲在房中等她的小寶貝降生？如否，那麼孕婦應該怎樣攝衛她自己呢？”這是一般現代的已懷孕婦女甚至尚未有孕的婦女們所亟欲解决的一個問題。美國的著名醫師開榮氏·JosepbineH·Kenyon最近在美國著名的家庭雜誌GoodHousekeping中發表了這個問題的答案，兹特按記憶所及，把該文的大意介紹於後：</p>
<p>在今日，一個婦女有了身孕並不須向社會告退。你若是一個有職業的婦女，儘可繼續服務直到產前的幾星期甚至幾天。不過攝衛之道却不可忽略，否則便要發生危險。</p>
<p>首先當注意的便是所穿的衣服。普通的女子因為要漂亮的緣故，常穿緊小的衣服，但這於孕婦並不適宜，因為這是肴害於胎兒的，一個有孕的婦女必須穿寬大而適合的衣服，且須注意到將來腹部更澎漲的大小而剪裁，這樣才能無礙。</p>
<p>其次當注意的是所着的鞋。鞋當然也須寬大，不過尤其要緊的是鞋頭不可太尖，必須留有寛闊的餘地足使腳尖伸展自如。鞋底必煩柔韌，鞋根不宜太高，若能穿平底的橡皮庭鞋更佳。</p>
<p>除了衣鞋以外，孕婦常注意的便是：每天至少有四小時須在室外，不過並非是接連着的四小時，你儘可把它分配在一天之中，譬如：上午有一小時半在室外，下午有一小時半在室外，黃昏時有一小時在室外，這樣一天之中豈不是共有了四小時是在室外的麼？然而最要緊的並不是一定要你固定着在室外的時間，隨時你若覺得疲乏，便當立卽休息，切莫勉强支持，若然你喜愛園藝生活的，切不要踞下，必須拿一小欃來坐着，才不致緊壓你的腹部，而致發生危險。彎下身體時，切莫用腹部，要用臀部。</p>
<p>如果疲乏時，你要在沙發或椅上休息一會的話，總不要忘記拿一隻橙子來擱你的腳，使你的腳能伸直而平放着。如果坐着覺得疲乏而要换換姿势，那麽切莫顧忌，只照着你身體上的需要而時常變換好了。</p>
<p>一個孕婦每夜至少需有九至十小時的安睡，飯後雖然你自己不要睡，也當勉强有一小時的休息。空閒時，可彈彈琴，或畫畫圖，總之照你所心愛的去消遣，不過不要使你的眼睛太用力。若要不使眼睛太疲乏也有方法，只要每隔少許時間把眼睛閉起來靜養幾分鐘就行。</p>
<p>孕婦雖可坐汽車，但不可跋涉長途，崎嶇不平的道路尤忌。最後須注意的，孕婦須多休息，且當終日快樂，不可積些微的憂鬱在心中。</p>
<h3>女報販</h3>
<p>— 陳天賜</p>
<p>上海眞是女人的世界，只要是女人，無論幹什麼事，終比較男子來得佔便宜，有出路。</p>
<p>盧家灣的魯班路一段，所有的日夜報，向來是男報販派送的。自從一個騎自由車的年約二十一二歲的女報販來呌賣後：一時各店鋪各住戶，紛向她定報，營業異常的發達。</p>
<p>有一天，筆者在路上遇到她，問起她對於販報的事業，有什麼感想？她却誠懇的回答説：“做我們小報販，是一種很可憐的事情，一天忙到晚，尚不得一飽，因為我們送一份報，每月只能嫌一二毛錢，如果每月能送一百份，亦只有一二十元，試想如何能過生活，去養家活小。再講到我，雖然比其他報販生意來得好些，然而亦很夠我受了。每天清晨就得到報館去領報來逐戶分送，約至九十點鐘才能送完，但我已踏得兩腿痲木，力不勝任了。迨下午四五點鐘，又得去送夜報，故我一天到晚忙碌着。在秋天，天氣尚溫和，還不致受苦，到了冬天，那眞苦不堪言，非但早晨颯颯的西北風受不住，還得騎這撈什子的腳踏車，假使稍不留意，便有危險事發生。此外使我感覺最痛苦的，便是那些主顧動手動腳的胡鬧，雖是心中上萬分的不願意，可是仍得陪着笑臉。如果不是這樣，就得觸動他們的怒，而打破飯碗。所以我覺得女子是最可憐的，尤其是我們在社會上服務的女子”！她説畢不勝欷歔，同時筆者聽了她一席話，也明瞭了許多世故。</p>
<h3>大地春回</h3>
<h3>當代木蘭小誌</h3>
<p>— 陳翠娜</p>
<p>上月二十一日某報載當代木蘭一則，略云：“去秋行軍贛之黄嶺，因前方匪勢稍殺，駐營半日，偶經小市，見一老翁，手持殘稿一卷，吟興正酣，詢之，則曰：日前國軍某營守此，刧火之餘，公私文件，殘散不堪，此亦殘稿之一也；署曰：詩劍從軍集，乃一青年軍官所著，其人實木蘭化身，而同伍皆不知其為女郎云。”末著其詩，而闕其姓氏，如神龍無尾，讀者疑之。其人固衆樓詩弟子，予頗知其身世，其中蓋有一段可歌可泣英雄兒女之至情，惜其淹沒，兹為述之；以證叟言之非虛，亦使人知天壤間眞有此奇女子也。</p>
<p>女周姓，諱其名，恐在軍中，有不便也，洛陽人，從軍時，年十八，今三年矣。幼時孤苦，依其仲父，家傳雙劍，女則視為良伴，每悲來起舞，庭樹皆嘯，既罷，慷慨流涕。字同里顏君，東北陷，顏組義勇軍赴國難，幾久無耗，或傳陣歿。女悲不自勝，日在病中，一日，忽奮悟曰：徒悲，卽死何益，且無以報顏君。遂喬裝剪髪，負劍從軍。銘劍曰：詩劍。書來告予曰：生不能殺賊以成功，死當殺身以成仁耳。其悲壯如此。女英明勇毅，而狀貌幽嫻窈窕如古美人。能詩畫，能金石篆刻，雖在軍中，未嘗一日不讀書也。</p>
<p>女既無家，惟一詩雙劍，恒以自隨。嘗以詩稿屬予書眉，子為署曰：詩劍從軍集·集中如宵馳鐵馬騎妖夢，春到征袍放血花。見懷云：昨夜小樓詩夢遠，一帆冷月進吳淞，修作翠樓詩弟子，此生端不羨梅花。又人間可恥是功名。皆可誦也。（餘見新聞報，及婦女旬刊，不重錄。）其惆悵衆樓詩姊妹，有人憐我淚沾巾，則為寄懷江亞南女弟而作·今亞南之募木且拱矣。周自去秋，忽無音問，今聞有客得其詩集於劫火之餘，為之憂念不已。不知萬方風雨中，此巾幗健兒，果無恙耶？嗟乎推深愛以及國家，執干戈而衛社稷，眞奇女子也。足使懦夫聞風，有立志矣。</p>
<p>予既感嘆其事，嘗為作新長恨歌兹附後以代贊云：斷送長城只等閒，蛾眉流恨滿關山，濸湘萬古蒼梧淚，風馬雲事去不還。女兒生小干戈裏，胭脂別有幽燕氣，十五明珠寶劍歌，兩行虎甲彎刀婢。芙蓉小苑調嬌馬，素額流光裹驚帕，射來柳葉滿苔階，打起黃鶯出花榭。依依叔嬸惜孤離，早歲曾為締女蘿，惜字年年嬌未嫁，偶因人問總顏酡。粉郞溫雅復英武，學劍學畫學詞賦，小隊羊車選璧人，滿樓紅袖看嬌婿。審意還防姊妹知，平時相見倍矜持，無心流露深情處，只在廻眸一盼時。此時豈謂成長恨，烽烟一剎傳邊警，男兒有志乞長縷，欲乞長纓無處肯。別為義勇組民團，不殺樓闌誓不還，揮旗成雲汗成雨，歡呼哭送聲連天。捐軀不得保妻子，鸞約卿自為計，含淚謝夫婿，君語抑何卑，身未分明意自堅，諾死生許知己。城頭日落畫魚袁，馬上琵琶抵死催，割衣一訣從今去，滾滾黃雲上將台。白衣誓師臨易水，塞上胭脂鼓聲死，矢窮援絕，奮呼，傷者感泣仆者起。以一當百氣不平，殺聲震天天為驚，胡虜此時皆感歡，李廣原是書生。倉廩百年空養士，抵抗何曾勞一指，但見熱血奔騰義勇民，縱橫恨骨填蒿里，深閨此夜愁到明，坐聽風雷漸漸平，空櫪逃歸無主馬，平沙無復漢家營。了知事去情猶變，破鏡樂昌望相見，蜂彈全穿看月樓，狼烟薰黑如花圓。諱消問息遍東北，不賦鴛鴦賦黃鵠，恨石如拳塞滿腔，一拍胡笳萬家哭。本來紅粉亦英雄，壯志鸞心誓始終。盡卸釵瑱兩雲髪，手披荊棘去從戎。木蘭漸向烽塵老，醒後悲歌夢中笑，夢揮雄劍下長城，相見顏郞猶玉貌。國破家亡草木新，此心灰木不重春，却將鳳折驚摧意，去作龍吟虎嘯人。邦交睦鄰重烽鏑，不問邊疆問流賊，臺上愁聞麋鹿游，草中先掃狐狸宅。海水東流萬古愁，三年此恨轉悠悠，美人獨抱金甌痛，説着危城已淚流。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>演馬戲肇慘劇</h3>
<p>— 羅才清</p>
<p>溧陽通訊：有馬戲班乘廢曆新年來溧奏技,借邑東公園隔河曠地上為塲址,并向當局備案。惟一河之隔，非搭橋不能通行，乃僱木作劉昌高承包木料工資，共計洋四十元。竣工後，经建設科勘過，卽開始營業，數日以來，往觀者踵相接，詎於十六日上午十一時許，該橋因橋板過薄，行人過多，轟然一聲，橋卽中斷，橋身亦隨之圯坍，一時落水者一百餘人……</p>
<p>筆者沒有到過溧陽，因而無從知道邑東公園興曠地所隔之河而闊度若何，不過就通訊所紀搭一木橋，承包木料及工資僅四十元，那河而要闊也闊不到那裏去。否則，這樣偷工减料的橋面，能夠經建設科勘過，眞使人懷疑該縣建設科的技術人員都是“膿包”了。然而那木板橋倒底還是偷工减料的，不見“橋板過簿，行人過多”，便是“轟然一聲，橋卽中斷。”不過我們也不能把這責任完全卸到木作劉昌高身上去，“橋板過薄”當然是肇事大原因之一，而小原因却在“行人過多”，建設科勘檢該橋的時候，或許沒有想到那馬戲班有那末大的號召力吧？我們試閉上眼睛想一想，在一頂“連工包料”四十元搭成的木板橋上擁擠着一百餘人”，（就落水者計算，或許還不止此數。）所謂“往觀者踵相接，”乃是實情，而不是文字上的形容詞。這樣推之，撞之，卽使“橋板不薄，”其不中斷者也幾希！那落水者“一百餘人”比之專會鬧事的學生們的“自行失足落水”同樣是“咎由自取”，雖然“鬧事”輿“看馬戲”太擬之不倫。</p>
<p>但是那些鄉下人倒底比不上智識份子的學生，看那通訊的後文：“有少數鄉人覩此，認為推原禍始，為馬戲所釀成，當將布蓬撕毀一空…“俗謂”殺人不怪怪磨刀，”大概就是如此情形了。然亦怪不得殺人何？所以那位通訊記者先生最後振筆直書“據聞此次馬戲來溧開演，興某機關有所妥協，而橋身如此浮薄，不知過問，致鬧此慘事，各關係人應負相當責任也。”我還是一字不易照抄了那新聞的標題做我文章的題目：演馬戲肇慘劇！</p>
<h3>兄妹</h3>
<p>— 白圭</p>
<p>萍和麗是一對很親愛的兄妹，他倆都有相當的工作。不過每次當他倆𥆐面的時候，萍看見麗的牙齒總有點黑黃，於是便勸她用好的牙膏刷牙。</p>
<p>過了多時，萍和麗𥆐面，看見她的牙齒還是和從前一樣，便問她為甚麼不聽他的話。</p>
<p>據麗説她這幾天都在用牙膏刷牙，並且説她所用的牙膏是上等的出品，因為她在報上看見這種牙膏登着新奇的廣告。萍聽了麗的話便説：“你再不要相信那些標新炫異的話了，牙膏的效用，是潔白齒牙，殺滅細菌，强健牙齦，保護牙瓷，祇有五洲藥房藥師監製的“一三一牙膏，才有這樣的藥劑功效”</p>
<h3>救命記</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>我寫這篇文字，並不是誇我自己的功德，而是給別人作為借鏡：</p>
<p>我有一個舍親，他到上海來找事，事情是找到了，但是因為他的年青，剛入社會，不幸受了妓女的誘惑，而染上淋症！並且他還被那庸醫所騙，以致担誤了治療的時期，轉入緾綿的慢性！等到我知道這事情去望他的時候，他已經顯得非常痛苦，性命很危殆！當時我便問他服過“的立平”沒有？他説沒有服過，我便叫他趕快買來服用，並對他説：“‘的立平’的藥力能直達病灶，澈底殲滅淋菌，它也許能在千鈞一發的時候救了你的性命。”後來他的病果然痊愈了，他非常感激我的一句話呢。</p>
<h3>雪</h3>
<p>— 落</p>
<p>大都會空氣里已經浮盪着春的氣息了，報章上也告訴我們該是“探梅”的時候了。“探梅”是雅事，然而更雅的應該是“踏雪尋梅”；因而想到雪。</p>
<p>據説在未立春之前降雪，對於農事上很有裨益，因為它能殺害那些藏在土塊中各種害虫的孵卵，故稱之曰“瑞雪”。不過春雪為什麼沒有那力量呢？老實是不知道，或者是不“及時”吧。在都市中却沒有“瑞雪”與“春雪”之別。在窮人，祇要降雪，就乖乖地預備“凍餒而死”；在富人，是有雪皆可賞，不知“瑞雪”，亦不知“春雪”也。</p>
<p>今年上海祇下過二次雪珠，都沒有堆積起來，這是“憾事”。南京各地竟有積雪至一尺者，雖然是“春雪”。不過也正因為是“春雪”，“踏雪尋梅”的騷人墨客就增多起來，據京滬，滬杭甬兩路局報告，因春節期內，旅客擁擠，循例加開三四等專車，以應需要云。</p>
<p>在這春節期內，和朋友們談起，也很想開開碼頭，能夠“踏雪尋梅”當然也暫時冒充一下雅人。不過旅行就得盤川，“路雪尋梅”更得大量籌備一筆被敲的“竹槓”。於是談談就算了，朋友之中誰也沒有離開過上海。</p>
<p>幸虧家藏有一幅“踏雪尋梅”的立軸，在春節期內掛出來作為壁節，亦聊以“臥遊”。</p>
<p>四面是峯巒起伏，平原上是一片梅林，有一老者，戴紅風兜，騎贏弱之騾，剛越板橋而過。橋下因山巔積雪溶化，被導入河，待彿聞流水潺潺之聲也。騾後隨琴童，挾一紙傘，循蹄印而進。</p>
<p>那踏雪尋梅“畫得很精緻，不過在我的筆底下就祇有這寥寥數筆了，而且也不及該畫精彩之萬一。如那老者彷彿側耳凝神，或許正在那里搜索枯腸，吟一首絕句；而那琴童，旣要探梅又不能</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>離開主人太遠，好像他的步子都有些趦趄不進的樣子。</p>
<p>古之雅人探梅是否如畫中一般無二，誰也無法證明，不過比今人雅一點是可以猜得的。今人都喜歡在西湖邊上造那些半中半西的別墅，就是雅不來的證據。他們探梅尋幽的時候，也一定一輛汽車直開到大路的盡頭，再換籐轎，呼着雪茄，一路而進，能够支着司的克，冒着泥濘之途跑上一陣路的，已經大雅特雅了。在回來的時候，又都是在汽車上或籐轎上掛滿了含苞未放的花枝，預備帶回去插在胆瓶里，一面由愛人奏着比耶諾，自己坐在火爐邊的絲絨沙發上，對看花枝凝視，亦自詡為林和靖的同志，那才是大笑話。</p>
<p>想到雪，才聯想到“探梅”，不幸文不對題，溜出了幾百字。不過“探梅離不了“踏雪”，雖然“賞雪”是另外一件事。</p>
<p>最近有位朋友從關外歸來，（或許是逃來）送給我一件很隆重的禮物，是一張吉林荒山子附近的雪景，在欲“賞雪”而不得的，住在都市里面的人們，自然又足以供“臥遊”之樂。但是吉林沒有梅林，否則，這輻現代“踏雪尋梅圖”在上海翻板之後，倒可以做筆好生意。現在索性　板刊出，看看我們“地大物博，富庶之區”的雪景。因為你卽使籌備了川資，恐怕還是欲賞而不得的，這樣又算是“臥遊”吧</p>
<h3>環球航空旅行紀（中）</h3>
<p>— 美國法爾考納博士著特譯</p>
<p>同日下午三時三十分，我由佛蘭克福飛往距離二百八中五哩的荷蘭阿姆斯特丹，而在下午五時十五分到達。王家荷蘭航空公司會派代表一員，在該航空港迎接，他領我到一家最大的旅館安歇。後兩日中，他陪我游覽荷蘭最佳的名勝地方，參觀世界最大的乾酪市場及俄帝大彼得青年時在荷蘭學習造船術所住的茅屋。旅館和其他的用費，都由該公司替我付去，並贈我旅行皮箱兩隻。五月十六日上午六時，我乘了該公司的飛機木鴿號，作長途飛行，由阿姆斯特丹到美屬海峽殖民地的檳榔埠。那飛機是美國道格拉斯式，在美國，這種飛機常載客十四人，這次長飛，只設八個坐位，以便乘客有休息和安睡的餘地。</p>
<p>我們在上午六時啟程，而在下午五時十五分飛抵希臘京城雅典，計飛行一四一二五哩，途中會在來錫，白拉蒂斯拉伐，南斯拉夫京城貝爾格勒小停。在雅典度夜後，次晨六時又出發，而在下午六時四十五分飛抵報連，計飛行一九七九哩，途中會在亞力山大利亞，開羅，迦柴小停。並在清朗的夜裏飛過約但河，拜德力罕，（耶穌誕生地）耶路撒冷聖地，和聖經上其他有名的地點。這一天我們飛過歐羅巴州，亞非利加洲，亞細亞州三大陸，並在世界三大名都進餐，早餐在希臘京城雅典，午餐在埃及京城開羅，晚餐在伊拉克京城報達。我們寄宿在幼發拉底河邊的河濱旅館，次日侵晨一時四十五分，匆匆起身，鐘嗚三下，又翱翔在天空中了。晚七時十五分，飛抵約特坡，這日整天飛行，共飛了一九六二哩。</p>
<p>次晨五時，繼續出發，下午五時十五分，飛抵仰光，計程一六七八哩，途中會在印度阿拉哈巴特和喀爾喀特小停，並會飛過著名的恒河三角洲，望見河水由如網密的出口，滾滾洩入孟加刺灣。次晨五時三十分，由仰光登程，途中在暹羅京域盤谷小駐。上午十一時，到達目的地檳榔埠，計飛行九七六哩。檳榔埠是王家荷蘭航空公綫的終點，再進，須改乘帝國航空公司的飛機，因為候班的原故，在該埠從五月二十日到二十五日留住了五天。檳榔是海峽殖民地英僑最先聚居之地，風景極佳，所以在寄居的五天中，很覺愉快。五月二十五日晨六時，我們乘了帝國航空公司的杜拉度號飛船出發，船中只有我一人是旅客，飛行七五○哩後，在法屬安南多爾蘭度夜。次晨六時，飛往香港，程長六五○哩，而於五月二十六日上午十一時到達。</p>
<p>到了香港，知道至少須等五個月，汎美航空公司才能開始載客，（釋者按據二月十五日紐約電，汎美公司已宣布從舊金山到香港的太平洋定期班航空，暫定在本年三月甘四日開辦。）於是我便决定利用這個時間，旅行菲列濱日本中國。我在每一處盤桓了約七星期，覺每處都有特殊的美點，又在朝鮮滿洲熱河盤桓了一星期。十月卅一日晨二時十一分，我在馬尼刺附近加維特埠乘夏威夷飛剪號飛往檀香山，同行的旅客，一共十人，內有女客三位。這是由菲列濱出發的第一次商業航空，夜中皓月當空，燦爛可愛，下午四時三十八分，飛抵瓜姆島，在汎美航空公司所設的旅館過宿。夜九時左右，覺地震頗烈，次晨五時五十二分績向華克島進發，兩地相距一五零六哩，出發未久，接得無綫電，報告瓜姆島曾遭劇烈的地震。</p>
<h3>晚飯</h3>
<p>— 羅鬱</p>
<p>在那茂然無邊的童山夾間，有兩條平舖的鋼軌向東方矢直地伸着。在那給春天底野風抖得發着嗡嗡的弦嗚的電綫上棲息着的灰色野鴿，像音符似地縮着小腦袋，又巧妙地嬝閃着陣頭風。</p>
<p>前邊是開拓得如牙床般的巨石，向两边闢好一條空路。那極遠處的鵝冠绒似的方塊小屋躲在山坡後面。那鐵路最先頭的敦鎮像一個戴了紅巾，鴕着重負的奴隸。</p>
<p>近處的小白屋里走出一個佝僂的人，舞着紅綠色的旗子。從那個車站上開來了下午最後一次的火車。</p>
<p>這是三輛破舊的客車，懶洋洋地駛行着。在那車箱裏，坐着很稀疏的工人和小商人模樣的乘客。那些工人的臉上盡是油和汗。黑色和發光的兩手有的扶着椅背，有的挾了紙烟。震得發響的窗子隔了一層暗光，透過山嶺底紅色。太陽偎近西邊的山頭了。</p>
<p>有一個新工人裝的孩子，在椅上低着頭坐着。他在不移地凝視着那隻飯盒空的。他底午飯（一碟鹹菜，一桶米飯，和一個煮熟的鷄蛋。）被人偷吃了。同事們面孔都是陌生的，漠不關心的。那午後的工作是給空着肚腹作了的。鼻子充滿了油味，空心肚子好幾次按壓不住想嘔出來。</p>
<p>他初次嘗到這不平的侮弄。那累得陷進一半去的眼窩下，生長着怨憤的萌芽了。圓胖的腮𣍰向下沉着，嘴唇就不自然地倔强起來。</p>
<p>他底肚腹一陣一陣地泄響着。車子的激動又使他腦暈。</p>
<p>工人們都各人佔了一隻靠椅叉開了腿或攤在椅靠手上。那椅角上的小商人們底粗聲的語調配合了車箱底震響。一個工人低低哼著蛟河鎮上底俗曲。一切都陌生地碰出着。一切都給顯示了不良的諷嘲。</p>
<p>照例那火車在那有兩排白灰工房的站台上停下來，暫時有一陣模仿着關東腔的吵嘴。那都是假裝。他們給油首圬面的人們一點安慰並博得同量的敬重。</p>
<p>那個新工人裝的十幾歲的孩子在肥大的深藍色的褲筒裏蹣跚着。個兒很矮，向太陽最後的火舌挪過去。</p>
<p>他是最近的秋天才隨媽媽跑出來的。那個媽媽初來時對什麼都嫌憎，不久却找到了她底牌友們，安祥地打定主意生活下去了。那個爸爸像一匹被磨損了的馬匹，而在每天晚間，他喝着一小壺的燒酒。</p>
<p>蛟河是伏在山腳下的一簇鎮屋。是聳峭的。傍晚來風在房頂上馳騁着。他們在這里渡過一個災難的寒冬。</p>
<p>當那矮小工人走進那小院的時候，有一個四十歲樣的婦人，手里握着一根劈柴，被打着一個不滿十歲的孩子。那個腦袋大得可憐。脖兒細得可怕的孩子。一邊哭着，一邊地胡話着。這個景象是常見的，他感到那根劈柴是一下下地落在自己底肉上。他很清淅的覺到一種羞辱的電流。</p>
<p>“媽媽！我去倒，我去倒”。他不間竭地嚷了出來，隨卽放下飯盒，拿起那個旁邊的水桶，跑出街去。</p>
<p>那間屋子是黑昏昏的。狹窄的板坑上放好了一隻小坑桌，有兩樣冷菜在那兒靜止着。有一個穿呢質路員制服的，長臉的中年男子，坐在地下的桌旁，靜靜地飲着酒。那淡淡的香味在他底鼻子尖端逗迷着。他不曾成口地呷飯，却像水禽似地喙拾着小豆。</p>
<p>不一會，那個油黑臉蛋的大孩子踏進屋里來了。那個媽螞扭亮了一撮桃核似的燈光；她給一串怨憤的氣喘攝住了。她就轉向那個圓圓的臉蛋，看到有兩顆晶瑩的淚珠流到黑罎一般的皮膚上。</p>
<h3>暮</h3>
<p>— 申冰</p>
<p>我把手指染黃着衰萎下去的陽光，立在掩着半幅的窗前，倦起了眼癰癰地望開去。橫織在短牆之角的蛛網驀地斷散了，黑色的蟲豸乘鞦韆而曳似地懸在虛空。灰塵噤默無語，這古老的日暮。靜靜地檐角抹着鬱鬱的昏黃。</p>
<p>從屋椽而至砌階下，暮色平張着燕翅色的翼膀悄然而降，棲止在短圍墙之內，輕顫有如剛才棲息在樹葉上的蜻蜓的瞙翅。於是在湫隘的庭院中，夜氣做成湖水一樣柔靜的暗波。蒼茫是略帶青色的。</p>
<p>飛倦的鳥藏首在羽翖間，以一隻紅色的腳趾抓緊樹枝站着，作終夜的憇息。偶然一隻遠來的鷹隼啼囀一聲，在寥闊的天際劃下一條黑色的閃電的弧綫。但柔靜的暗波停瀦着，瀰散着。</p>
<p>晚雲猶豫在陰晦的天上，飄吹着，漸漸地低壓到院角下來了。庭院裏，鄰家的孩子拾起竹刀和木馬回家去了。年輕的少婦提着煤油燈借最末的殘陽添加青油，深深地絢絏着的腰又慢慢地欠了起來；剛從外邊回來的拉車人正在數着腰裏倒出來的錢。在那極其坷坎的臉子上閃過一嘴子𥡸稜的笑。將夜了。</p>
<p>暮色迷蒙着窗，煤油燈也照不亮。像誰給窗拉上了幔子。</p>
<p>如一輛破敝的敗車，　　於荒野，煤馨水涸，從黑茫茫的霧裏期待着一髪蒼青的山巒。疑是儎着黃昏。</p>

<h3>Chiang Submits Report on Xi'an Incident</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Chiang submitted a report to the Third Plenary Session on the Xi'an Incident, and attached a booklet of "Half a Month in Xi'an" compiled by hand. At the fourth general assembly of the plenary session on the afternoon of the 19th, a resolution was made on Chairman Chiang's report. The report and resolution are recorded separately as follows. (Chairman Chiang's Report) I respectfully report that, in December of last year, Zhongzheng was overseeing the military operations to suppress the bandits in the Northwest, which were expected to be completed in half a month to a month according to the planned schedule. I made a special trip from Luoyang to Shaanxi to personally supervise and urge the progress. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang and others suddenly caused chaos, resulting in the Xi'an Incident on December 12. They launched an attack in Lintong and Xi'an simultaneously, using the name of "military remonstrance" but carrying out the reality of abduction. The central military and political officials in Shaanxi were also detained, disrupting discipline and shocking both domestic and international communities. Zhongzheng was excessively sincere and lacked foresight, only carrying a small number of guards, who all died resisting. At that time, in the chaos of the incident, I was cut off from contact with the outside world, and only resolved to sacrifice my life for righteousness, seeking to be worthy of my revolutionary duty. I also deeply believed that our central government would uphold the spirit of General Li's legacy and make appropriate decisions regarding suppressing the unrest and consolidating the foundation of the country. Later, thanks to the appropriate decision-making of the central authorities and the unity of the military and civilians throughout the country, justice was proclaimed, causing the instigators of the rebellion to repent and change their ways, and the incident was quelled. Zhongzheng returned to Nanjing on December 26, and Zhang Xueliang surrendered himself and wished to receive the punishment he deserved. The details of the incident should be reported in detail, but since December 12, although Zhongzheng has been generously tolerated by the central authorities and has not been condemned, my dereliction of duty has been so serious that I have already regarded myself as a criminal awaiting punishment and have not dared to report on the position of public office. I will only record the situation I experienced at the time on a daily basis and compile it into a booklet to answer the inquiries of my comrades. I respectfully submit it for your review. Upon investigation, the individuals involved in the Shaanxi Incident at that time issued a circular telegram, stating their so-called national affairs propositions, which aroused considerable attention from the outside world. On the day the incident occurred, Zhongzheng sternly reprimanded Zhang Xueliang, so he could not fully express what he wanted to say. It was not until the third day after the incident that I learned that he had eight propositions, namely: ㊀ Reorganize the Nanjing government and accommodate all parties and factions to take responsibility for saving the country; ㊁ Stop all civil wars; ㊂ Immediately release the patriotic leaders arrested in Shanghai; ㊃ Release all political prisoners in the country; ㊄ Guarantee the people's freedom of assembly and association; ㊅ Open up the patriotic movement of the masses; ㊆ Faithfully follow Sun Yat-sen's will; ㊇ Immediately convene a national salvation conference. Zhang Xueliang insisted that Zhongzheng allow them to implement these as their common propositions. Zhongzheng always ordered him to immediately repent and send Zhongzheng back to Nanjing. In addition, I did not want to listen to any statements, except to point out the absurdity of his actions and the meaninglessness of these propositions. I also lectured him that the party and the country have a definite organization and system, and even if there are opinions, they should be submitted to the central government for legal petition. Zhang asked to submit it to the central government after returning to Nanjing. Zhongzheng immediately explained that even if it could be submitted to the central government, I would declare that I did not approve of the propositions in the telegram. The details of this conversation are also detailed in the booklet, but this section is more important and must be specifically mentioned to draw the attention of all comrades present. Now that the plenary session is open, there must be definite instructions on the aftermath of the Northwest, and there must be a detailed review of national affairs. All choices of what to take and what to discard, and what is permissible and what is not, should be decided by the consensus of the public. Therefore, I have specifically described the process of Zhang Xueliang's presentation of the eight propositions to Zhongzheng, in order to provide reference. In addition to Zhongzheng's handwritten booklet, "Half a Month in Xi'an," which is submitted for your review and distribution to all comrades present, this is a special report. Respectfully submitted to the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, Chiang Zhongzheng, March 18. (Resolution of the General Assembly) After the General Assembly accepted Comrade Chiang Zhongzheng's report on the Xi'an Incident and the booklet "Half a Month in Xi'an" compiled by him, it deeply recognized that the incident occurred suddenly at that time. Fortunately, Comrade Chiang was able to maintain an inviolable integrity and a fearless spirit in the face of extreme danger, causing the instigators of the rebellion to sincerely submit, be moved, and repent. Therefore, he was able to support the crisis, stabilize the situation, and quell the great unrest. The General Assembly expressed its deep admiration and comfort for his unwavering loyalty to the party and the country in the face of danger. The civil and military personnel who died in this incident for resisting and refusing to yield, or who risked their lives for righteousness, or who loyally resisted and died in their posts, all displayed a righteous spirit and are worthy of praise and lamentation. The General Assembly also expressed its admiration and condolences. As for the so-called eight propositions of the instigators of the rebellion, when they asked Comrade Chiang to submit them to the central government, Comrade Chiang resolutely declared his opposition with a solemn attitude. The General Assembly expressed its deep admiration and comfort. Regardless of its content, this proposition, since it was made through the behavior of rebellion and the method of coercion, is clearly a pretext for creating chaos and cannot be tolerated by national law and military discipline. The General Assembly is willing to ignore it in order to prevent imitation. However, our party adheres to the legacy of General Li's magnanimity and compassion, and the spirit of doing good to others. Those who are lost and know how to return, repent, and extricate themselves can generally be treated with sincerity and without any further investigation. We only hope that those who have repented this time can truly turn over a new leaf, thoroughly awaken, and pledge their loyalty to repay the party and the country. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Request to Reiterate Resignation</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] After Chairman Chiang returned to Nanjing from Xi'an, he repeatedly submitted requests to the Central Government to resign, but they were not approved. He has now submitted another request to the Third Plenary Session to reiterate his resignation in order to take responsibility for the Xi'an Incident. The Fourth General Assembly of the Plenary Session on the afternoon of the 19th unanimously resolved to reassure and retain him. Chairman Chiang's letter of resignation and the General Assembly's resolution to reassure and retain him are as follows:</p>
<h3>Original Text of Chiang's Resignation to the General Assembly</h3>
<p>Respectfully submitted, since the Xi'an Incident last year, Zhongzheng has deeply grieved over the destruction of discipline and felt deeply guilty before the gods. In addition, due to accumulated fatigue and accumulated transgressions, I am unable to bear the burden. I have repeatedly submitted requests to the Central Government to be relieved of my various concurrent posts, but they were not approved. Instead, I was consoled and given a leave of absence to recuperate. Zhongzheng, feeling grateful for the Central Government's kindness, and knowing that the Plenary Session would be held soon, temporarily accepted the leave of absence and did not dare to continue to submit requests. Now, after spending over fifty days in the mountains reflecting on my faults, although the Central Government's authority has quelled the unrest, the people's hearts have been shaken for a long time, and the national vitality has been visibly damaged. Reflecting on the cause of the chaos, I am even more aware of the weight of my sins. If I had not lost my way in leading and guiding correctly, and had not been able to fully exercise my skills in appeasing, how could I have allowed subordinates who had been taught for many years to dare to commit such an act that endangers the foundation of the country? Zhongzheng, entrusted by the party and the country with important military and political responsibilities, cannot shirk my responsibility. Therefore, even though I have requested that the ringleaders be specially pardoned for their deserved crimes, I dare not evade my own immense transgressions. Since retreating to reflect on my errors, I have been filled with remorse at all times. I deeply believe that if I bear the responsibility for even one more day, I will not be able to find peace of mind for even one more day. For the party and the country, there is no way to demonstrate the strictness of rewards and punishments. For myself, I will only deepen the fear of falling into ruin. Now, on the occasion of the Plenary Session, I once again express my sincere feelings and earnestly request to be allowed to resign from all my posts as Vice-Chairman of the Central Standing Committee, Vice-Chairman of the Central Political Committee, President of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, so that the laws and disciplines of the party and the country can be upheld and my original intention of taking responsibility can be fulfilled. I am filled with the urgency of awaiting orders. Respectfully submitted to the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, Chiang Zhongzheng, February 18.</p>
<h3>General Assembly Resolves to Reassure and Retain Him</h3>
<p>The General Assembly, upon reading Comrade Chiang Zhongzheng's letter, deeply considers that for more than ten years, Comrade Chiang has been in charge of the central government and commanded the troops, with outstanding sincerity and having endured great hardships. As for the Xi'an Incident, it was an extraordinary event. Comrade Chiang, upholding General Li's fearless spirit, was able to awe his subordinates and prevent the seeds of chaos. The manifestation of his great personality is unprecedented. At this time, when the country is in great difficulty and everything is waiting to be managed, it is hoped that Comrade Chiang will lead the masses, work hard to move forward, complete the unfinished work of the revolution, and comfort the hopes of the people. The party's future deeply relies on him. The request to resign from his various concurrent posts should not be considered. (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)</p>

I would like to take this opportunity to further explain a few important meanings of the New Life Movement to my fellow compatriots. First, we must understand the dire situation our country is in now, which is the so-called time of both internal and external troubles, one after another, and the national crisis is serious. If we do not want to sit idly by and wait for death, we must bear the responsibility of reviving the nation. The cause of reviving the nation is not the cause of an individual, nor is it the cause of a small number of groups, but the cause of every compatriot in the country. How can this cause of everyone succeed? Simply put, there are two elements: First, is to make the general public have national morality and his spirit. Second, is to make the general public have national knowledge and his skills. The higher the morality and the stronger the spirit of the people, the easier it is to make society progress. The broader the knowledge and the more sophisticated the skills of the people, the easier it is to improve life. Progress in society and improvement in life are the prerequisites for reviving the country and the nation. The promotion of the New Life Movement is to achieve this goal, to improve social customs, cultivate national vitality, and create the foundation for our survival and national revival. The meaning of the anniversary is originally to review the achievements of the past and to encourage future work. In the past two years, I have often gone to various provinces and cities to inspect, and I feel that in many places, there have been significant achievements in the two items of rules and cleanliness. As for improving the countryside, promoting domestic goods, paying attention to hygiene, and promoting frugality, there have also been considerable achievements. In addition, there was also the summer internship program for university students in rural areas, as well as the summer literacy schools automatically organized by university and middle school students in various places. Although it was a pioneering initiative, there were 66 university student representatives from universities in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou who used their summer vacation opportunities to participate in universal voluntary work in rural areas, improve the lives of farmers, and awaken farmers' awareness of the country and the nation. At the same time, students also gained a lot of experience in serving society and familiarized themselves with the actual lives of farmers, which is indeed a win-win situation. This is very gratifying. However, we cannot be satisfied with this. The promotion of our New Life Movement cannot achieve the intended goals. Therefore, I would like to contribute the following points to the comrades who are promoting the New Life Movement. (To be continued) (Central News Agency telegram on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Extracurricular Notes from the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>— Qian Hua, Reporter of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee in the capital on the 15th, it has been in session for five days, and most of the important proposals have been settled. The closing declaration is now being drafted with great solemnity to make a general conclusion. The declaration drafting committee met once on the 18th to conduct a thorough discussion of the declaration and decided that Wang Jingwei would preside over the drafting of the declaration. This conference was convened after the victory of the suppression war and the resolution of the Xi'an Incident. How to gradually repair our broken rivers and mountains to achieve the goal of restoring our integrity? Regarding the aftermath of the Shaanxi Incident and other internal issues, how can we make the national will unified and gather the national strength and people's strength to bury ourselves in the work of saving the country and preserving our existence? On these issues, the Central Committee is indeed bearing a very serious responsibility. Now that they are gathered together to decide the future domestic and foreign policies, the expectations of the people of the country are self-evident.</p>
<p>During the conference, the reporter visited the capital for several days. From the surface, the conference did not have any tense atmosphere, which is obviously a manifestation of the national calmness. However, the bosses of major hotels smiled and all the hotels were full. Some of the Central Committee members lived in the Capital Hotel, some lived in the Central Hotel, and the rest were scattered in the official residences, Beijing offices, and overseas Chinese reception centers. During the meeting, the hotel was as quiet as usual, but after the meeting, from 4:00 or 5:00 PM until the evening, countless streamlined cars were lined up outside the hotel, and the corridors inside were crowded with guests who came to visit, which was very lively. Usually, small rooms in the hotel are easy to sell, and large rooms are always empty, but this time it was the opposite. The more luxurious rooms were already full. Some Central Committee members led a lot of adjutants and guards, so they usually opened two rooms, and those with more attendants opened three rooms. He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, opened six large rooms, and a row of "He" characters on the passenger board was very beautiful. As far as the members attending this meeting are concerned, it is more enthusiastic than any previous session, which symbolizes the national unity and the spirit of resisting foreign aggression. Although the military and political figures that the whole country is watching, such as Yan Xishan, Song Zheyuan, Gan Fuju, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Liu Xiang, etc., are sick or have something to do, and asked the conference for leave and could not attend in person, which is unavoidable, but they all sent very important plenipotentiary representatives to contact outside the meeting, which is not much different from attending in person.</p>
<p>Now it is time to talk about the news industry itself. This conference was more strict about news control than any previous session. When the conference was in session, a special security line was set up near the Central Party Headquarters. The first step was to obtain a special vehicle pass, otherwise, you could not cross the Leichi line. The second step was to need a special badge to enter the venue, otherwise, you could only sigh at the door, and even the staff of the Central Party Headquarters had to follow the rules. And news reporters do not have the right to obtain such passes and badges. So, there is absolutely no trace of news reporters inside or outside the venue. In the past, although news reporters could not attend the meeting as observers, there was a reporter reception room outside, and they could still meet with the members when the meeting adjourned and took photos. Since the assassination of Mr. Wang two years ago, there has been a deep invisible separation between reporters and dignitaries. Of course, this conference is no exception. The conference news is prepared by the secretariat and handed over to the Central News Agency for publication. On the one hand, it does save a lot of manpower and financial resources for the newspapers, but many newspapers still sent people here and had to find a few attending members after the meeting to get a little bit of news. A certain member said to the reporter with a smile that the news industry always holds the concept of recording everything they hear, but this is actually wrong. After asking, you have to distinguish right from wrong, choose, and then publish it. Sometimes, a person in the venue is excited and makes a speech. If the newspaper writes it down and records it, things may grow from small to large. If you don't write a word, small things can become nothing. So, sometimes it is better to publish less news. You can save trouble, and the government can save trouble too. This kind of philosophy of doing nothing is one end of our country's native culture, and peace and reconciliation all start from this point, which is indeed a great truth.</p>
<h3>Wu Siyu Temporarily Replaces Director of the Military Affairs Commission Office</h3>
<p>The Issue of Zhu Peide's State Funeral Will Be Submitted to the Standing Committee of the Military Affairs Commission for Discussion</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After Zhu Peide's death, the position of Director of the Military Affairs Commission Office that he left behind is now temporarily replaced by Wu Siyu, Deputy Director of the Office, by order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It is widely believed that the issue of Zhu's state funeral will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the Military Affairs Commission for discussion this week. In addition, Li Du, a veteran of the Northeast Army, had a very deep personal friendship with Zhu. Hearing the bad news of Zhu's death, he was extremely saddened and has telegraphed his representative in Beijing, Liu Buguang, to go to Zhu's spiritual altar to express condolences and to send a telegram to his family.

<p>[Nanjing] The Funeral Committee for General Zhu Peide has been established after the main person, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, appointed the members. The original temporary funeral preparation office and its groups are subordinate to the command of the committee. The committee held a meeting at the Zhu Peide Funeral Hall of the Renxiao Funeral Home on the afternoon of the 19th. He Yingqin presided over the meeting. It was decided that General Zhu would be coffined at 4:00 PM on the 20th, as well as the various etiquette during the coffining. It was also decided that the coffin would be moved to the Piro Temple at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 21st, and the date of the memorial service would be determined after the coffin was moved. In addition, on the 19th, those who came to the hall to express condolences were still very enthusiastic. The chief mourner, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, also visited the hall in person at about 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th and inquired about the preparations for the coffining from Huang Shi, a member of the funeral committee. He left the hall after half an hour. After Zhu's body was injected, dressed, and moved to the preparation room, it was covered with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Party Emblem of the Kuomintang. The chanting group invited lamas and senior monks to chant sutras beside him. It is reported that all the Central Committee members in Beijing will participate in the coffining on the 20th.

<h3>Britain Increases Defense of Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>According to recent reports from Reuters, the British government has recently paid great attention to the defense of Hong Kong. From November to December last year, there was a long-term exercise in the sea, land, and air in Hong Kong. According to reports from London, the cost of building new barracks in Hong Kong reached a huge amount of 1.1 million pounds. On the 18th of this month, a Hong Kong telegram also reported that the British authorities had designated two square miles of Stanley Peninsula in southern Hong Kong as a military zone and built secret fortresses. According to the 16th telegram, the largest-scale defense exercise will be held in Hong Kong in the middle of next month, with the participation of the army, navy, and air force, including 2,500 soldiers, the entire fleet of the Chinese waters with 25 ships, 1,000 soldiers from Singapore, and one squadron of flying boats. There are also island air defense forces and the newly established naval volunteer team. Not long ago, the British army had a large-scale exercise in Singapore. Now Hong Kong is also showing the same military activities. What is the significance of this in the development of the situation in the Far East?</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Singapore are both important British military bases in the Far East. In terms of their original status, Hong Kong's importance is actually greater than Singapore's. However, due to the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, which stipulated that Hong Kong was within the scope of non-fortification, Britain took Singapore as the military center of the Far East. But at the end of last year, the Washington Treaty was abolished and invalidated by Japan's statement. The Pacific's non-fortification regulations were also canceled. So, in the turbulent waves of the Pacific, Britain began to extend its maritime military activities from Singapore to Hong Kong again.</p>
<p>Britain's active increase in the defense of Hong Kong is mainly due to three motives. First, the gradual advancement of Japan's economic power into the South Pacific. Now, Britain's markets in Hong Kong, Malaya, and India have been almost entirely taken away by Japan. This situation has caused great threats to the capitalists of Lancashire. The competition for the market is easy to develop into the competition for territory. Therefore, the British colonial authorities have to prepare for defense as soon as possible. The first is the southward advance of Japan's military power, which has now become increasingly clear. The development of Taiwan's naval and air ports, the secret military construction of the South Pacific mandated group of islands, the conspiracy to obtain the right to excavate the Siamese Canal, and Japan's coveting of our Hainan Island are all sufficient to arouse the fears of the British military authorities. Therefore, the strengthening of Hong Kong's defense this time is also very significant in the struggle between the two major powers of Britain and Japan. The third is that the development of the entire Far Eastern situation has aroused Britain's active attention. In 1936, the British diplomatic authorities had explored Japan's views on the Far East compromise several times, but all ended in failure. And the establishment of the Japan-Germany alliance at the end of November gave a serious blow to Britain's position in the Far East. Due to this vast international diplomatic impetus, Britain's policy towards the Far East seems to have gradually changed. Especially in its relations with China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Britain has somewhat abandoned the narrow attitude of the "die-hard" conservatives of the past and adopted a friendly and cooperative policy. The advancement of this policy will naturally make Hong Kong's status gradually increase in importance. Since the completion of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway last year, the longest railway communication line in the world from Hong Kong to England has almost been formed. And Pan American Company's trans-Pacific air route will also directly reach Hong Kong on the 24th of next month, connecting with China National Aviation Corporation's route. All of this is enough to show the importance of Hong Kong in future Far Eastern transportation and international cooperation. We hope that the British authorities can promote the collective security link on the Pacific Ocean based on this policy change and jointly oppose the greatest aggressor.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Approves National Defense Loan Bill</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Defends Policy Forcefully; Strengthen Military to Prevent Aggression; League of Nations Mechanism to Create Peace</p>
<p>[London] The British government's plan to issue a national defense loan of 400 million pounds was debated in the House of Commons today. Despite opposition from the Labour and Liberal parties, it ultimately passed by a large majority of 329 votes to 145. This occurred after Prime Minister Baldwin made a vigorous defense of the government's policy, after which the vote began. Prior to this, both the Labour Party and the opposition Liberal Party had indicated they would vote against it.</p>
<p>In his debate speech, Baldwin stated that the sole purpose of this expenditure was to enable the nation's strength to reach a standard that could guarantee the safety of Great Britain and the Empire, "so that it can contribute its modest efforts to the maintenance of world peace." Baldwin further stated that the nation's financial strength was fully capable of implementing this plan without endangering social undertakings or causing excessive price fluctuations that would affect the people's standard of living. Baldwin reiterated Foreign Secretary Eden's statement that Britain's military power would never be used for aggression, but only for the defense of the Empire and those who are invaded. All parties now aim to maintain peace, and the government has previously exerted its utmost efforts to create peace within the framework of the League of Nations. If it unfortunately fails, the government certainly cannot accept failure as the final outcome. However, the government has not yet abandoned its hope and aim for peace. What it is currently striving for is to conclude a new agreement with the countries of the former Locarno Treaty to replace the old Locarno Treaty.</p>
<p>According to Baldwin's opinion, the greatest hope in the near future lies in the conclusion of regional agreements. Baldwin continued that the greatest cause of unrest in Europe in the past two or three years has been the imbalance between Britain's burden and responsibilities and its lack of strength. That is, in collective security, if one wants to contribute even modestly, one must first have the ability to maintain oneself. Baldwin firmly believes that if a mutual assistance treaty can be established in Western Europe, peace can be maintained; otherwise, once it breaks down, "what will be before us will be European military and air combat countries of the first rank." Moreover, Britain also has territories in the East. On the one hand, Britain should have the ability to take care of itself at sea, but if unfortunately things exceed this scope, Britain must also have the ability to take care of itself. If Britain does not actively cooperate with other countries or have the ability to take care of itself, then joining collective security is a very dangerous thing. Therefore, the government's proposal today is to avoid this danger. "What we are discussing tonight concerns our security and the safety of our people," he said.</p>
<p>Questions from the Opposition</p>
<p>The first speaker in the opposition's debate was former First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander. The main points of his speech were as follows: ㊀ The reason why the military expansion program is needed is because the government has missed many opportunities in the scope of its diplomatic policy in the past few years. ㊁ The government has not provided evidence that it has obtained the legitimate value of the funding it intends to request from Congress. ㊂ The method of raising debt to finance this expenditure goes against the path of stable finances, which is the weapon used by the political opposition to resist the 1931 MacDonald government.</p>
<p>Inskip's Reply</p>
<p>Next, Minister for Coordination of Defence, Sir Thomas Inskip, rose and stated that he had not seen any speaker ask about any item of the armaments program contained in the White Paper on Tuesday. Inskip also answered Alexander's question, saying that when the budget is submitted to the House of Commons, the House will naturally have ample opportunity to protect the economy.</p>
<p>Government Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Regarding foreign policy, Inskip quoted Foreign Secretary Eden's speech on January 19, saying, "The government is now actively engaged in the reorganization and rearmament of military affairs. We deeply feel that this move is something we cannot avoid in order to achieve our goals. However, this move itself is not our goal. What remains is to negotiate a solution for Europe and consolidate the authority of the League of Nations. We are prepared to cooperate with the powers in the joint work of political appeasement and economic cooperation."</p>
<p>Four Military Plans</p>
<p>Inskip then mentioned that during Wednesday's debate in the House of Commons, he criticized the government's program for lacking genuine coordination, citing the four plans that had been agreed upon as evidence. The Navy, Army, and Air Force are cooperating in these four plans. He hoped that this would alleviate public concern about this matter. ㊀ The coastal defense problem has been thoroughly studied, focusing on the vulnerability of each port to attacks from the sea or the air. The actual defense measures required for each port in modern conditions have been specified, and the allocation of various weapons has been discussed with local authorities. ㊁ The national air defense problem has been studied in detail not only by experts from the Navy, Army, and Air Force, but also by experts from relevant departments, to reach the precise level of protection that needs to be given to each specific location. As a result of this study, the total amount and nature of the defense expenditure have been determined, so that the expenditure mentioned in the White Paper can be based on precise planning. ㊂ The accumulation of munitions. ㊃ The potential of industry.</p>

<p>Lessons Learned from Incidents</p>
<p>Inskip continued that the House of Commons was probably not aware that the government had conducted a thorough investigation into the ability of various factories to manufacture weapons and ammunition. For example, the government discovered that there were shortcomings in certain needs of the Army, and immediately set about remedying them. In the Tyne and Wear region, it is engaged in mechanical engineering to ensure that production capacity can meet any emergency needs. As for higher strategic matters, Inskip was pleased to reiterate the experience and intelligence gained by experts from the Navy, Army, and Air Force, whether they were operating on their own or under the Committee of Imperial Defence. He also mentioned that attention had been paid to the lessons learned from the incidents in the Eastern and Western Mediterranean last year. Inskip also cited several important issues that his department had organized and cooperated in studying, namely the import of food, the transformation of wartime transportation, the organization of transportation in ports and inland, the distribution of wartime rations, the storage of food, and the storage of raw materials.</p>
<p>Regarding the storage of raw materials, Inskip said that the government had acted in a timely manner and had planned to store as much as possible of the important materials needed for the manufacture of armaments. Inskip continued, "You cannot measure security in small ways. Any government worthy of the name must ultimately make it its duty to ensure that no foreign country can subdue us. Britain's inviolable credit is its priceless treasure," he said.</p>
<p>Relationship with the Dominions</p>
<p>Inskip did not agree with the opposition party's criticism of the policies of the Dominion governments. He said, "When the Imperial Conference is convened this year, we will have ample opportunity to consult with the representatives of the governments of the various Dominions. At that time, the policies of the Dominion governments should be presented by their representatives. We cannot force them to be bound by our constraints." As for the opposition party's claim that Great Britain is paying the price for the defense of the Dominions, Inskip said, "The reason why we must have the government pay for the defense costs of certain colonies and dependencies in the Empire is because these places are within our sphere of responsibility and because we rely on these places as sources of raw materials. Moreover, the Dominions also realize the value of their connection with Great Britain. For their own safety, they are using their own money to prepare themselves," he said.</p>
<p>Labour Party Speakers Again</p>
<p>After Sir Thomas Inskip finished speaking, Labour MP Wedgwood took the floor. Wedgwood said that if Britain faces any danger, the danger must come from Germany. Therefore, "we must consider the need for an alliance with France and Russia." Wedgwood further said that in the Spanish war, Britain should send people to both sides to inspect the latest lack of progress in the war and avoid wasting military expenditure. Wedgwood said that the reason why the Labour Party opposes this military expenditure is not because the party is unwilling to fulfill its responsibility to protect the nation, democracy, and the working class around the world, but because it still has doubts about whether this kind of tool can achieve peace. Labour MP Cripps continued that he acknowledged the need for armaments because the Labour Party currently recognizes the National Socialist Party as the primary public enemy. However, if the British people want to obtain a guarantee against National Socialism, they must first grant the Labour government the power to manage foreign policy and military force. Labour MP Montagu then indicated that the opposition Labour Party would vote against the National Defense Loan Bill. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Britain Expands Navy, US Generals Hasten to Catch Up</h3>
<p>Believe it is Necessary to Adopt New Procedures; Japan Pays Great Attention to Actions of Britain and America</p>
<p>[Washington] Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, declared today that if the British Navy continues to expand, the United States will need to adopt new naval procedures. Walsh also requested that close attention be paid to the naval movements of Britain and other powers. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] Britain's new naval plan, which plans to increase the number of capital ships by three and cruisers by seven, according to the remarks made by US Undersecretary of the Navy Edison after his meeting with President Roosevelt today, will not have an unfavorable impact on the United States. Edison also stated that the counterattack on the American side in this matter is two-pronged. On the one hand, Britain's purchase of new materials from the United States will naturally bring considerable benefits to American commerce. However, the United States' own naval construction plan is currently stalled due to a shortage of steel and copper materials, and this situation is likely to be further impacted. According to Edison, if the current dispute between the government and the steel industry cannot be resolved soon, some shipyard workers will be laid off in March of this year. This is because the American steel industry, in opposition to the implementation of the Healy-Snyder Act, which mandates a 40-hour work week, has adopted the strategy of refusing to supply each department with the steel materials needed for shipbuilding as a form of resistance. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Senate Naval Affairs Committee today passed a bill prohibiting idlers from taking photographs or making surveys of naval and military fortresses. (18th, National News)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that Britain's plan to expand its military will incite European and American countries to expand their armaments and will have a significant impact on Japan. According to the Foreign Ministry's opinion, the British government's inclusion of a five-year military plan in the budget this time is completely different from the previous form of the budget. It seems to be a plan based on the anticipation of a major crisis within three or four years. The goal of this plan is to expand the Air Force and the Navy. As far as the Navy is concerned, the British government plans to build three capital ships, seven cruisers, and two aircraft carriers in 1937 and 1938. The United States has always advocated equality with Britain, so it is obvious that it will actively build warships to counter Britain. From this point of view, Britain's naval expansion will not only promote the strengthening of the US Pacific Fleet, but if its capital ships come to the Far East to strengthen the defenses of Singapore, it will have a major impact on East Asia. Japan cannot but pay attention to the future of Britain's plan. (19th, Domei News)</p>
<h3>Italy Actively Expanding Military</h3>
<p>Supreme Party Conference to Be Held Next Month; Mussolini to Personally Inspect North Africa</p>
<p>[Rome] Well-informed sources have recently declared that the Fascist Party's Supreme Council is scheduled to meet on the first of next month to study various needs in Italy's national defense and will request Congress to allocate additional funds to expand military preparations. Italy's military preparations are now underway. The Air Force is conducting daily aerial attack exercises in the city of Rome. Prime Minister Mussolini, along with the undersecretaries of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, inspected various airfields two days ago. (18th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Rome] Mussolini is scheduled to depart on the ninth of next month for Tripoli, the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, to preside over the opening ceremony of the highway connecting the port of Tripoli to the port of Benghazi. He will then inspect other cities in Libya, which is expected to take more than ten days. At that time, more than sixty warships belonging to the First and Second Fleets will conduct exercises off the coast of Libya, to be reviewed in person by the Prime Minister. (18th, Havas)</p>
<h3>US Warship Exercise Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>Gun Explosion Causes More Than Ten Deaths and Injuries</p>
<p>St. Petersburg The US warship "Wyoming" reported by wireless telegraph today that one of its five-inch caliber guns suddenly exploded during an exercise, killing six people and injuring ten. Shortly afterwards, the warship arrived here and immediately sent the injured to the hospital. The warship, which is 26,000 tons, was launched in 1912 and is one of the oldest in the US fleet. It has recently been withdrawn from the main fleet and is only responsible for patrolling. (18th, National News)</p>
<h3>Turkey Orders Warships from Italy</h3>
<p>[Rome] It has recently been learned that Turkey will soon order several warships from Italian naval shipyards, and will supply Italy with high-quality coal from the Erigli mining area on the Black Sea coast to offset the cost of the warships. This arrangement was reportedly agreed upon during the talks held by Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Milan. (18th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Balkan Four-Nation Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Measures to Deal with the Current Situation; Views Are in Complete Agreement</p>
<p>Athens The Permanent Political Conference of the Balkan Entente countries has recently concluded. A communique was issued, explaining the results of the conference, which stated: ㊀ The Entente countries (Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Turkey) hold completely consistent views on the current international situation. ㊁ The Entente countries consistently support the League of Nations and actively participate in its various tasks. ㊂ The Entente countries believe that the Mediterranean Agreement previously concluded between Britain and Italy is of great benefit to the friendly cooperation of the Entente countries. ㊃ The next Permanent Political Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva in September.

<h3>Japanese Army Minister Explains Reasons for Military Expansion</h3>
<p>Parliament Will Accept Budget; Finance Minister Plans to Transport Cash</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee held a closed-door meeting today. Army Minister Sugiyama Gen presented a special map of the military situation in eastern Siberia and North China to explain the necessity of expanding Japan's military preparations. Based on the map and statistics, he provided detailed examples of the Soviet Union's military preparations in the Far East and the transportation capacity of the Siberian double-track railway. At the meeting, Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa also explained the reasons why Japan must expand its naval power and gave a detailed explanation of the naval construction situation in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. There is great concern here about Britain's recent announcement of a five-year plan to increase military preparations by 1.5 billion pounds. The goal of this plan is to compete with the total strength of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and to increase Britain's naval strength in the Far East. (Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The various political parties in the Diet, in the current environment, may have no choice but to accept the revised budget for the next fiscal year proposed by the Hayashi Cabinet. Its characteristic is the issuance of public bonds to reduce the amount of the shortfall. The budget drafted by the former Finance Minister Baba had a shortfall of 802,400,000 yuan. The current Finance Minister Yūki has reduced this number to 725,400,000 yuan. The revised budget requires a total of 2,769,400,000 yuan, a reduction of 269,100,000 yuan compared to what Baba had proposed. The largest item of austerity is the 220,000,000 yuan that the Hirota Cabinet planned to allocate to the governments of various counties to reorganize their finances. Now, 150,000,000 yuan has been cut. Other austerity items total 19,100,000 yuan. This is because various undertakings planned for implementation have been delayed by one year, of which the Army and Navy account for 23,000,000 yuan. Before the revision of the budget, ordinary taxes were estimated at 2,236,100,000 yuan. Because Yūki's draft estimate changes the tax rate, this item is only 2,044,000,000 yuan. There is no doubt that the actual amount of the budgetary cuts is only 120,000,000 yuan and will be criticized, because the cut in the delayed implementation of the reorganization of county finances is merely empty talk on paper. However, farmers will certainly have many complaints about the delay. In short, the heavy burden of Japan's Army and Navy expenses has now been strengthened. The Finance Minister's revised plan to increase taxes to cover a portion of the government's increased expenses has abandoned the plan of the previous Finance Minister to increase several new taxes that would hit capitalists. This is quite commendable. Today, the financial community is satisfied with the budget, so the investment market has become firm. The business community is quite dissatisfied because the government levies heavy taxes on them, which they regard as contrary to the government's policy of promoting the expansion of Japan's productive capacity. The Farmers' Committee wrote that the new budget takes more from the farmers than it gives and ignores the plight of many rural areas. The Army wishes to state that the reduction of Army expenses in the next fiscal year (23,000,000 yuan) does not mean the cancellation of what the Hirota Cabinet had promised to give, but only because of technical difficulties, what cannot be used this year will be delayed until next year. (Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In a response to Nakano Seigō's question in the House of Representatives on the 18th, Finance Minister Yūki stated that if necessary in terms of exchange policy, cash transportation can be implemented. This measure will not have a harmful impact on Japan's gold reserves. Finance Minister Yūki acknowledged that the exchange market has stabilized since the government announced the exchange control order, but because the Yokohama Specie Bank holds a meager amount of foreign loans, for future exchange policy, it has been decided to use the method of transporting cash to promote the development of trade through close contact between the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Japan. As for the timing and method of cash transportation, the Finance Minister intends to entrust the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Japan to decide.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan Governor Ikeda Seihin, regarding the issue of cash transportation, issued a statement saying that Finance Minister Yūki's response can be interpreted as preventing exchange rates from falling. If necessary, the government will not hesitate to implement cash transportation. The time for its implementation will be when the current system of import exchange permits cannot be maintained. After the implementation of cash transportation, the import exchange permit system will still be difficult to abolish. Currently, the amount of foreign currency held by the Yokohama Specie Bank has decreased slightly, so in order to maintain the benchmark exchange rate of one shilling and two pence, the Bank of Japan must transport the legal tender it holds abroad. In that case, the Bank of Japan must start by transporting new gold production, and on the Bank of Japan's side, because it has a position of encouraging gold production or alleviating private cash smuggling, it may also increase the gold purchase price.

<h3>Internal Struggles Between Political and Civil Parties</h3>
<p>Possibility of Disintegration</p>
<p>[Tokyo] As the Japanese House of Representatives begins to examine various bills today, concrete issues are being discussed. The Budget Committee meets every day in the morning to examine the budget, and heated debates are inevitable. However, the public is not allowed to attend, so the content is unknown. The trend of this session of the Diet has been determined, and serious disturbances are unlikely to occur. What is currently worthy of our special attention is the possible developments after the Diet adjourns and the concrete diplomatic policies adopted by the Hayashi Cabinet. Due to the resignation of President Suzuki of the Seiyūkai, fierce struggles between the various factions within the party are already in progress, causing the party's disintegration to come sooner and facilitating the emergence of new parties. Although the situation in the Minseitō is not serious, the clamor for reorganization is also high. In the future, after the Seiyūkai collapses, the Minseitō may also disintegrate. Therefore, the liberalists and protectors of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai and those who advocate controlism will all seek their own way out. As a result, two major opposing camps will be formed. The most difficult problem to solve will be the selection of the leaders of these parties. Currently, there is a shortage of leading figures in the two major camps. Without suitable leaders, the development of the new movement will be delayed. In the future, the most promising leaders of the Minseitō and Seiyūkai are undoubtedly Ugaki Kazushige and Konoe Fumimaro, but it is extremely questionable whether Ugaki and Konoe believe that the time is ripe and whether they can truly bear this great burden. Also, the Hayashi Cabinet's foreign policy is based on the principle of coordination. This was made even clearer when Hayashi answered Nakano's questions yesterday. As for the concrete plan for policy towards China, it may not be established until after the Diet adjourns. It is still difficult to predict whether the Hayashi Cabinet will seek a full-time Foreign Minister, because it is widely believed that Hayashi's concurrent position as Foreign Minister can facilitate the implementation of his policies.

<h3>Japan Absorbing Manchurian Funds</h3>
<p>Osaka Tomita, president of the Manchurian Industrial Development Bank, attended a懇談会 sponsored by the Japan-Manchuria Industrial Association on the 18th and stated that the Manchurian Industrial Development Bank's operating policy must strive to absorb the deposits of the Manchurian banks. However, because "Manchurians" are unwilling to deposit, they have no choice but to absorb funds by issuing special bonds. Manchuria's nine-year economic plan requires 300 million yuan in funding. The funds transferred from Japan to Manchuria have traditionally been 250 million yuan per year. If it can be increased by 100 million yuan, then it will be sufficient. (19th, Domei News)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Reinforce South of Capital, Launch Major Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Government Forces Resist Vigorously but Fail to Succeed; Aerial Battle Occurs in Madrid</p>
<p>Madrid Special dispatch from our reporter: Yesterday, the Nationalist Army had 10,000 fresh troops arrive from the cities of Seville in the south and Badajoz in the west, southeast of the capital. Most of them were Germans. At about 3:00 PM, they joined forces with the original garrison and launched a counteroffensive against the government army's positions in the town of Maranoza near the Jarama River. The fierce battle lasted for three hours. At the same time, twenty-one Nationalist Army bombers, escorted by several fighter planes, dropped bombs to assist in the battle in the sky above the battlefield. Several government army planes immediately took off to engage them, shooting down seven Nationalist Army planes. Four government army planes were also shot down. As a result, the government army's line of defense remained unyielding because the hand grenade squads fought to the death. The Nationalist Army ultimately failed to succeed. (19th, Havas)</p>
<p>Avila According to a statement released by the Spanish Nationalist Army, the government army and the Nationalist Army's planes engaged in two air battles in the skies over Madrid yesterday. The first battle involved a total of forty fighter planes, about two and a half miles from the ground. A total of nine government army planes were shot down and crashed, and another plane was shot down in the afternoon battle. In addition, when Nationalist Army planes attacked the Tituynia airfield, they destroyed five government army planes. No Nationalist Army planes were lost. Cuenca, which is now gradually becoming an important base for the government army's rear defense line, was also bombed by a Nationalist Army plane. Only one government army plane was lost. It also claimed that the government army had attacked the fortified positions held by German soldiers in the Malaherida-Tajuña area. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Join Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>Conspiring With Germany and Japan</p>
<p>[Paris] 事業報 The diplomatic reporter, Madame Tabouis, recently declared that the leader of the Spanish Nationalist Army government, General Franco, has concluded an agreement with Germany stipulating that General Franco will join the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan (established on November 26 of last year) so that each country will provide mutual assistance in the event of a conflict with the Third International. In exchange, Germany will allocate 1,500 members of the National Socialist Party's Brownshirts to General Franco to form a special police force. In addition, General Franco has promised that once he wins the civil war, he will declare his withdrawal from the League of Nations on the grounds that the League of Nations should not support the republican government of Valencia.

<h3>Sudden Death of Soviet Heavy Industry Commissar Ordzhonikidze</h3>
<p>Succumbs to Sudden Cardiac Paralysis; Zinoviev's Sister Also Arrested</p>

<h3>Recent Situation in Xi'an After the Shaanxi Incident</h3>
<p>Rumors of Xi'an Becoming a Realm of Terror are False; Gu Zhutong is Responsible for Handling All Aftermath</p>
<p>Xi'an Special Dispatch: Since the Shaanxi Incident occurred, dragging on for two months without resolution, various parties have become increasingly suspicious. While rumors may be unavoidable, this reporter, in order to understand the truth, left Pingyang the day after Guangyuan and came to Shaanxi, arriving in Xi'an after two days and nights. I saw firecrackers exploding and drums beating incessantly in the city of Chang'an, shops closed for business, and tourists bustling about, filled with the strong atmosphere of celebrating the Spring Festival. The citizens' enthusiastic display of celebrating the lunar new year was the same as in other places. The rumor that Xi'an had become a realm of terror was proven false. The Northwest aftermath is entirely under the responsibility of Gu Zhutong, the head of the Administrative Office. Gu follows the Central government's peaceful policy and generous attitude, using political means to handle everything. Upon arriving in Xi'an, he immediately convened senior cadres of the Central Army and senior personnel of various agencies for a speech, stating that the Xi'an Incident had come to an end. There is no need to criticize the past, but individuals should reflect on past mistakes, correct past arrogant attitudes, adjust emotions, and unite in spirit to walk the path of saving the country and the people. After the February 2nd Incident was pacified, the Northeast generals, after expelling the few radical instigators such as Sun Mingjiu, Miao Jianqiu, and Ying De, all recognized the national crisis and should support unity, peace, and national salvation. The person in charge is Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of Gansu Province. Yu is known for his overall awareness and indifference to personal gain. He has a deep sense of national and ethnic identity. He received a handwritten note from Zhang Xueliang when he escorted Chairman Chiang to fly to Beijing, ordering him to command the Northeast armies. During the February 2nd Incident, Sun Mingjiu and others used violence to force him to issue orders for resistance against Japan. Wang Yizhe died for this. Wang never succumbed to their pressure. His desire for peace and support for unity can be imagined. He Zhuguo went south to meet Chairman Chiang a few days ago and flew to Fenghua yesterday to meet Zhang, reporting on the situation in Xi'an and requesting instructions on how to handle the aftermath. He will return to Shaanxi in the coming days to convey the central government's intentions. The details of the negotiations and the conditions of each party may not be disclosed in advance because the timing is too early or because they involve military secrets. After He Zhuguo returns to Shaanxi in the coming days, a peaceful resolution can be expected to take shape. This reporter left Pingyang on the night of the twelfth, arrived in Zhengzhou on the thirteenth, went west that night, and arrived in Xi'an on the evening of the fourteenth. The scenery along the Pinghan and Longhai Railways was completely different. I will briefly describe a few aspects for the readers. The common scene along the Pinghan Railway from Shenyang to Zhengzhou was that each station was decorated with firecrackers to celebrate the New Year. From time to time, I saw mule carts full of men and women dressed in red and green heading to relatives and friends to wish them well in the old year. Even today, in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the abolition of the lunar calendar has not been fully implemented. It can be seen that old habits are hard to break. The white snow along the way gave a sense of a bountiful year. The scenery seen along this route was entirely peaceful. The scenery along the Longhai Railway from Zhengzhou to Xi'an was completely different. What I saw at each station were crowded troop trains, fully armed troops, rows of tanks and weapons, centralized railway locomotives, destroyed railway bridges, and remaining trenches. The Weinan station was the most severely damaged. The station building and warehouses had their roofs blown off, the railway bridge was destroyed and lay across the riverbed, and more than ten miles of railways were destroyed. The rails were cut into pieces, the sleepers were lost, and barbed wire and electric fences were scattered along the road. On the platform of Chishui Station, the wooden sign indicating the station name only had the character "赤" (chì, red) remaining. The place where the character "水" (shuǐ, water) was written had a bullet hole. The people along the road were busy filling in the trenches, hoping that after the civil war ended, they could cultivate the spring fields to maintain their lives. On this road, cruelty and the ferocity of the god of war were revealed everywhere, and the feeling became two different worlds. Fortunately, the central government is broad-minded and sincere. The generals regretted the war and supported unity, turning hostility into friendship. It is the good fortune of the country and the blessing of the people. (16th)</p>
<h3>Kwantung Army of Japan Implements Military Training for Northeast Youth</h3>
<p>Initial Stage: 15,000 People Aged 16-19; To Be Driven to the Front Lines as Cannon Fodder When the Far East War Occurs</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: In order to permanently consolidate its illegally seized Northeast, the Japanese Kwantung Army has adopted measures beyond using force to ensure both external and internal suppression of resistance. They have also created various novel systems to create an inseparable relationship between the people of the Northeast and themselves, such as promoting the 麻醉 (mázui, anesthesia) policy of harmony and friendship between Japan and the puppet regime, and actively promoting enslavement education. More recently, they have implemented military training for Northeast youth. The intention is that when the Far East War occurs in the future, the trained youth will be driven to the front lines as cannon fodder. Currently, there are 49 locations throughout the Northeast where youth military training centers are established. The initial intake capacity is 15,000 people. The training method is divided into five terms per year, each term lasting two months. During this time, they must study Japanese spiritual civic courses and coaching courses. The civic course is further divided into five parts: the spirit of Japan-Manchukuo harmony, legal system, welfare, industry, and Japanese language. The coaching subjects and curriculum focus on coaching and physical exercise. The basic conditions for the youth admitted are that they must be between 16 and 19 years old and physically strong. After the training is completed, if there is no war externally, they will be sent back to their hometowns to serve as instructors in rural areas, so as to achieve the excellent result of farmers obeying the Japanese spirit and completely eliminate the roots of anti-Manchukuo and anti-Japanese resistance. All instructors in the training centers are filled by members of the Japanese Harmony Society, who must be between 25 and 35 years old. The training of these instructors will be completed within the Harmony Society from the 20th of this month to the end of the same month. As for the textbooks used in the training centers, according to the true information leaked by the Japanese, they are currently being compiled by authorities on military education within the Kwantung Army. Generally, they can be completed by the end of this month and printed around the 20th of next month.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Mechanic Killed in Car Accident</p>
<p>Zhang Jiarui, a sock repair mechanic from Taihe Sock Factory in Gaojiayan, this city, is from Pudong, 29 years old. He arrived in Songjiang yesterday and started working at the factory. Unexpectedly, today, during work, he suddenly felt like going out for fun and hired a bicycle to stroll along the Songhui Road. Traveling from west to east, a car driving from Sijing to Songjiang in the afternoon at 1 PM encountered him head-on at Shajia Bridge. Zhang's bicycle should have yielded to the right, but in a moment of confusion, he yielded to the left and collided with the car with a loud bang. The person fell to the ground. The car driver, Yin Jiangguan, was unable to brake in time and ran over Zhang Jiarui's head and right hand. His skull was crushed and his brains gushed out. He died instantly. The city police substation has detained the car driver and notified the factory. On the one hand, they reported to the local court and sent a prosecutor to the scene for inspection. It was determined that the deceased did not understand the method of yielding to traffic and tragically met his end. The factory has claimed the body for burial and notified the deceased's family.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Sudden Incident of Water and Land Guards in Tangshi</p>
<p>The town of Tangshi in this county has a long-standing gambling problem, which is especially rampant during the Lunar New Year. Because of the location being a water area, it is difficult for land police to make arrests. The authorities had previously informed various teahouses and written agreements to refrain from gathering for gambling. However, the general gamblers seized the opportunity to gather near the water area. Since they were beyond the reach of the land police and the water police could not go ashore to make arrests, they have been at peace for ten days. However, the water and land police have become suspicious of each other, each suspecting the other of protecting the gamblers. Trouble-makers have also been stirring up trouble and spreading rumors. After the land police cracked down on three gambling cases in Jinzhuang Harbor the day before yesterday, the water police and land police had a sudden conflict, disrupting the market for a time. Subsequently, Xu Henian, a detective of the land police, was arrested by the water police. The two sides resisted each other and engaged in a fierce fight. Xu has now been temporarily released on bail by local figures. Both sides have submitted reports to their superiors for review and instructions.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin</h3>
<p>Citywide Air Defense Drill</p>
<p>Today (the 16th) at 2:00 PM, the city of Huaiyin held an air defense drill. About ten minutes after the alarm sounded, five enemy planes flew in from the east. At that time, the police and public security teams controlled traffic and prohibited pedestrians from traveling on the streets, and all the city's beggars were driven into the public theater, prohibiting them from loitering on the streets. In addition, the Huaiyin Normal School Affiliated Primary School and the County Anti-Smoking Hospital were designated as shelters. If there were any injured civilians, they would be taken to those locations for treatment. After about twenty minutes, two civilian houses in Zhang Garden inside the city and Li Tan outside the city were set on fire by bombs dropped by enemy planes. In addition, a poisonous gas bomb was dropped by enemy planes inside the Dabeimen gate. At that time, all the fire brigades and the Red Cross were mobilized to carry out rescue work. When the enemy planes left at 2:40 PM, a blackout drill was practiced for twenty minutes after 8:00 PM that night. The results were excellent.</p>

<h3>The True Meaning of National Salvation Through Unity</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>A Review of "The Truth About the So-Called Chinese People's Front and a Review of its Theory"; Seeking Advice from Mr. Luo Huanmei</p>
<p>Half a month ago, I heard that a newspaper in Nanjing published an article criticizing the "Chinese People's Front," which involved me. I was very skeptical at the time. I thought, I have never talked about any "Chinese People's Front," why would someone drag me in! It must be that my friends were mistaken, and I did not believe it was true. At that time, because I did not know which newspaper in Nanjing the article was published in, I could not find the original text, which was quite disappointing, but soon I forgot about this rumor.</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, I went to Suzhou to see the plum blossoms at the invitation of a relative. Although the plum blossoms were not yet in full bloom and there was no elegant plum blossom viewing event, I did not even get a good look at the daily newspaper during my few days as a guest. After returning to Shanghai, I heard from a friend about the article criticizing the Chinese People's Front, and it was republished in the Shen Bao on February 15, 16, and 17, titled "The Truth About the So-Called Chinese People's Front and a Review of its Theory," which did involve me and assigned me as a "theorist of union." After hearing this news, I was truly delighted and hurriedly searched through the pile of old newspapers for these three days' issues. I was fortunate enough to find them, and I realized that the words of wisdom I had long admired were bestowed upon me by Mr. Luo Huanmei.</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Luo's "Review" in one breath, I only felt that Mr. Luo had wasted his efforts. Because Mr. Luo is reviewing the "Chinese People's Front," but no one in China today is advocating the "People's Front." Then, Mr. Luo's so-called "truth" is naturally not "true," so there is even less to say about "theory" and "review." As for the part that involves me personally, I only feel extremely apologetic. I have nothing to do with the "Chinese People's Front" and have never talked about "Chinese People's Front." Facts speak louder than words, so why should I waste my words? Originally, Mr. Luo's "Review" this time was a complete miss, and there was no need to "review" it again. However, at a time when the call for national salvation through unity is high, Mr. Luo's remarks will actually hinder the great cause of unity. They are very harmful to the public, who are still vague about the true meaning of national salvation through unity. Therefore, I feel that I still have to come out and argue. I think that in today's world, where the whole country is forming an iron unity, it is not a complete waste of words.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to sincerely ask Mr. Luo and his like-minded friends to restrain their emotions a little. When discussing national affairs, please do not bring any anger. We know that only truth can persuade people, and the most cruel debate is the current facts. Today, China's "national destiny is in danger," as stated in the declaration issued on the night of February 16 by the Shanghai All Circles United National Salvation Grand Alliance. Without national unity, there is no way to stop the "enemy's aggression" and "recover lost territory. Without national unity, there is no way to save the countryside." In terms of construction, only the peaceful "completion of the nation's true unity can save the country." These words reflect the greatest demands and most common desires of the national public. Last year's special changes in Guangdong and Guangxi and the Xi'an Incident were all peacefully resolved by the government. We cannot deny that this is the government taking into account public opinion and implementing the will of the people. We cannot help but be moved. At the same time, this also shows how the people of the whole country are expecting unity and peace. But unity is not empty talk. The so-called unity is because it recognizes that there is still division and opposition within the country. If we avoid talking about the division and opposition in reality, that is not sincere talk about unity. If we fundamentally deny that there is division and opposition in the country, since reality is "one," then there is no need to talk about "unity." Because we have division, we demand "unity." There is not only one way to promote "unity." In the past, some people used force to seek "unity," but the lesson we learned is that using force to seek unity, in this process of unity, both sides have a lot of power consumption, which only eliminates national power and is not enough to manage "concentrated national power." Therefore, the people's demands do not advocate unification by force, but tend towards the road of peaceful unification. Today, if we do not talk about saving the country, then that is that. If we talk about saving the country, we must be a "truly patriotic Chinese." If he opposes saving the country through unification, then he is either a traitor or an idiot. If he also advocates saving the country through unification by force, then he is either ignorant of the domestic political situation and the demands of the broad masses of people, or he has ulterior motives. What explanation should peaceful unification be given? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Fifth Sino-British Billiards Tournament Concludes, China Retains Championship</h3>
<p>Zhu Qiliang Loses to Nie Kell Yesterday; China Wins by a Total of 418 Points</p>
<p>The fifth Sino-British billiards tournament concluded yesterday. In the five groups' scores, the Chinese team scored 2,866 points, and the British team scored 2,448 points.

<p>Yesterday's Recap</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first group match for both sides. China's Zhu Qiliang played against Britain's Nie Kell. Zhu's skills were superior to his opponent's, but the result was a loss of three points because Zhu did not want to win too much and casually shot. The last two times he sent the red, he could end it, but the ball was near the pocket, and he was too hasty and failed again and again. Otherwise, there would be no such unexpected setback. Zhu Qiliang was the first to reach 300 points, exceeding Nie Kell by more than 110 points. However, he showed mercy on the gun, giving Nie Kell a chance to catch up, creating a situation where they were side by side. After 500 points, Zhu Qiliang stepped up his efforts, shooting out various methods one after another. When he reached 31 points, the enemy ball fell into the pocket, but he used the red ball to continuously shoot and pocket eight shots, reaching 55 points, a total of 597 points. With only one shot left, he could have finished the 680 points. Suddenly, he lost his mind. Nie Kell also had a score of more than 565 points, so he rose up and made a final move, but Zhu sent the red twice again without scoring, so Nie Kell was able to win 600 to 597. (Nie Kell) 200, 30, 25, 38, 21, 31, 12, 27, 25, 45. (Zhu Qiliang) 21, 20, 42, 20, 33, 36, 20, 33, 42, 27, 20, 50.</p>

<h3>High School and Junior High School Students Welcome National Composition Essence</h3>
<p>Prepare This Necessary Book, Composition Difficulties Can Be Solved Immediately</p>
<p>High school and junior high school students should pay attention to the subject of composition to increase their writing ability. Teachers teach Chinese textbooks for students to read carefully, but each semester is only about twenty or thirty articles.

<h3>New Life Movement Third Anniversary Celebration</h3>
<p>Attended by Over Six Hundred Representatives from All Circles, Emphasizing the Great Significance of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the third anniversary of the New Life Movement. The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association held a commemorative meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 10 a.m. yesterday morning, gathering over six hundred representatives from various institutions, organizations, and schools. Instructor Wu Tiecheng, due to official duties in Nanjing, sent Zhang Yuanruo to deliver the address. The proceedings of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang Shouyong's Opening Remarks</p>
<p>At 10 a.m., the ceremony commenced. Chairman Zhang Shouyong delivered the opening remarks, stating, "Today is the third anniversary of the New Life Movement, which was initiated by Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and has become popular throughout the country. This afternoon at 8:30, Mr. Chiang will deliver a speech, which will surely offer valuable lessons for everyone. Today, I will draw upon what Mr. Chiang usually advocates – the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean – to elaborate on the meaning of the New Life Movement. I am not sure if what I say will be correct. If it is, please pay attention; if not, please forgive me or offer criticism. Because although the New Life Movement was initiated by Mr. Chiang, it requires everyone's efforts to implement it in order to live up to his teachings. First, let me discuss the relationship between the Great Learning and the New Life Movement. The Great Learning teaches people to proceed from the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge to sincerity of intention, rectification of the heart, cultivation of the person, regulation of the family, ordering of the state, and peace of the world. This means that things have roots and affairs have ends, and it is a consistent whole. These eight items must be based on the three cardinal guides: to manifest illustrious virtue, to renovate the people, and to rest in the highest excellence. The word 'to' in these three is crucial, requiring much effort and action to achieve the goal. Regarding 'renovate the people,' Master Cheng said that 'renovate' should be taken as 'new,' the 'new' in New Life. Zhu Xi said that 'new' means reforming the old. It is clear that manifesting virtue should extend from oneself to others, so that they too may be able to remove the stains of old habits. The stains of old habits have reached their peak today. The meaning of revolution today is to remove these stains. The meaning of construction today is to rest in the highest excellence. Zhu Xi said that 'rest' means inevitably reaching this point without wavering. The highest excellence is the ultimate in what is naturally right and proper. For example, the four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are lethal. Is this not the ultimate in what is naturally right and proper? If everyone knows the ultimate in what is naturally right and proper, why should we worry about the country not being unified or the nation not being revived? Therefore, the first of the three cardinal guides is to set an example oneself, which is 'manifesting illustrious virtue.' The second is 'renovating the people.' The Book of Documents says, 'Renew the people.' The Book of Poetry says, 'Although Zhou was an old state, its mandate was new.' The third is to rest in the highest excellence, which means 'the superior man leaves nothing undone.' Zhu Xi said that from renovating the people, all rests in the highest excellence. Resting in the highest excellence takes various forms. In terms of self-cultivation, it involves cutting and polishing; in terms of function, it means that the superior man cherishes the worthy and is close to his kin; in terms of knowing the root, it ensures that there will be no lawsuits; in terms of sincerity within, it cautions against idleness and doing evil in solitude, and not to be like the inferior man who hides his evil after seeing the superior man; in terms of anger, fear, fondness, joy, sorrow, and worry, none should fail to be correct. Finally, in terms of the way to generate wealth, it emphasizes producing much and consuming little, which is tantamount to killing production. The Doctrine of the Mean speaks of the strength of the South and the strength of the North, emphasizing tolerance and gentleness in teaching, and not teaching people militarization. It speaks of kites flying and fish leaping, dressing in brocade and donning silk, which is tantamount to teaching people art. This is a brief explanation of how the Great Learning relates to the New Life Movement. Let me now discuss the Doctrine of the Mean. The Doctrine of the Mean is a characteristic of the Chinese people. Seeking the hidden and drawing on the strange is contrary to the Doctrine of the Mean. Confucius also said that the superior man embodies the Doctrine of the Mean, while the inferior man acts contrary to it, referring to this point. The wise exceed it, and the foolish do not reach it, hence the way is not practiced. Shun was very wise, but he used the Mean among the people, and everyone said, 'I know,' driving them into nets, traps, and pitfalls without knowing how to avoid them. The Song scholar Yuan Mengqi said, 'They do not know the nets, traps, and pitfalls, and simply take them to be broad dwellings and safe homes. How pitiable!' The practice of ordinary virtue and the expression of ordinary words, this is propriety; when there is something lacking, one dares not but strive, this is righteousness; when there is something extra, one dares not exhaust it, this is integrity; words accord with actions, and actions accord with words, this is a sense of shame. If people can always embody these seven sentences of the Doctrine of the Mean, they will naturally know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Everyone can be a superior man, and no one will be an inferior man. In their respective positions, whether rich or poor, in ease or hardship, there is no one who is not content. The root lies in being able to know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, for dwelling in ease and awaiting destiny is vastly different from seeking danger and striving for greatness. The superior man has the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and also the nine standards for ordering the world and the state: cultivating the person, honoring the worthy, loving one's kin, respecting great ministers, being considerate of all officials, cherishing the common people, attracting artisans, treating distant peoples with kindness, and cherishing the feudal lords, all returning to the principle that without sincerity, there is nothing. Extending this to reviewing the old to gain new knowledge, this 'new' is the 'new' in the New Life. Zhu Xi's commentary is the best, saying that the old is what has been heard before, and the new is what is gained now. The Great Learning speaks of renovating the people, and the Doctrine of the Mean speaks of gaining new knowledge, echoing each other from afar. Continuing with the statement that being honest and generous is to attach importance to propriety, this propriety is the propriety of the four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame in the New Life. With one propriety, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame can all be encompassed. Therefore, today I speak of the New Life Movement, presenting Mr. Chiang's frequent advocacy of learning the Doctrine of the Mean for everyone. The New Life Movement is the way of a true king. Although the way of a true king has no immediate effect, if everyone knows the importance of the New Life, then the way of a true king can be practiced. All ultimate excellence is contained within this. I hope everyone will live up to Mr. Chiang's fundamental meaning of saving China. As the Doctrine of the Mean says, introspect without guilt, have no evil in your will. Please everyone introspect, fulfill your responsibilities as citizens, each make a resolution, and have no evil in your will. The so-called having no evil in your will is to unify your will to defend the country, seek national order, and achieve peace in the world. This is what is expected of the people and gentlemen of the country."</p>
<p>Representative Wu, on Behalf of the Instructor, Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, Representative Zhang Yuanruo delivered a speech on behalf of Instructor Wu Tiecheng, stating, "Today is the third anniversary of the New Life Movement, and representatives from all circles are gathered here to hold a grand commemorative meeting. Mayor Wu, as the instructor of this association, originally intended to attend in person, but he had to go to Nanjing to attend the Third Plenary Session, so he could not be present. Therefore, I, Yuanruo, am representing him and delivering a rough speech. The New Life Movement has several major meanings. First, it is a revolution in life. Second, it is a construction movement for a new citizenry. Third, it is a movement for national revival. In terms of the first point, the revolutions in various countries of the world each have their own special meanings. There are political revolutions, industrial revolutions, and social revolutions. The Chinese National Revolution, due to different historical backgrounds, national spirits, needs of the times, and social conditions, contains many different meanings. It not only has the comprehensive nature of political revolution, industrial revolution, and social revolution, but also has the side effects of psychological revolution and life revolution. The New Life Movement, launched in Nanchang in 1934, is a revolution in national life. Although the initial meaning of this revolution is only moral and spiritual, its ultimate goal and its corresponding effects are greatly related to social reform, political innovation, and economic construction. In terms of the second point, the New Life Movement is a construction movement for a new citizenry. The purpose of revolution is not only limited to the destruction of the upper-level external things, but also focuses on the fundamental internal transformation. The conditions for establishing a country are not only limited to material development, but also value the encouragement of the national spirit. Although China is a cultural nation with the longest history, the thoughts, spirits, and living habits of the general population are now decadent and disorganized, unable to cope with the changes of the world and compete with others for survival. The New Life Movement, on the one hand, takes our country's inherent morality as the standard, so that the daily life of the people should conform to the spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. On the other hand, it also takes the rationalization of life as the principle, so that all life actions should conform to the conditions of 'orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, and punctuality.' It is indeed a basic construction movement for training modern new citizens. In terms of the third point, the New Life Movement is also a movement for national revival. The highest goal of the New Life Movement is to seek the militarization, industrialization, and artisticization of the people's lives. Advocating artisticization, transforming crude, violent, vile, and wretched behaviors, so as to seek the nobility of the people's lives; advocating industrialization, transforming the people's behaviors of stealing, fighting, laziness, and complacency, so as to seek the affluence of the people's lives; advocating militarization, transforming the behaviors of disorganization, fear of difficulty, and cowardice, so as to seek the consolidation of the people's lives. If the life of a nation can be consolidated in terms of national defense, affluent in terms of material, and noble in terms of spirit, this nation will undoubtedly be able to strive for its superior position in the international arena and develop its infinitely long and great life in the track of human evolution. The meaning of the New Life Movement is so profound and great, but the true essence of the New Life Movement is not here, because the philosophical basis of the New Life Movement lies in 'action' rather than in 'knowledge.' The basic essence of the New Life Movement values practice and does not advocate empty talk. The guiding principles of the New Life Movement, as everyone knows, are propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are not new or strange principles, but a kind of traditional thinking, the crystallization of our country's inherent moral civilization. Therefore, in promoting the New Life Movement, we really do not need to elaborate on the theory too much and engage in empty talk, but rather value the practical implementation and especially start from each person's own practice.</p>
<p>Our Chinese nation has always boasted of its spiritual civilization and prided itself on being a nation of propriety and righteousness. The ruling class and scholars of China for thousands of years have also regarded propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as the ultimate principles for governing the country and teaching the people. However, as a result of thousands of years of empty talk and boasting, not only has propriety disappeared and shame been swept away, but also because the spirit of discipline and organizational ability are not as good as others, we have been ridiculed by 'rising nations.' This is not because we have no education, but because the principles of governing the country and teaching the people that our former sages and philosophers gave us have only become empty words and have not been transformed into practical actions, so that any profound theory cannot transform actual life. The so-called propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame have only become empty words boasted on the lips and have not become the creed practiced in life. Therefore, the principles of the sages teaching the people for thousands of years, because scholars who falsely defend the Way know but do not act, have not produced any practical effects in governing the country and promoting society. During the May Fourth Movement, some people shouted 'Down with the man-eating ethics,' but how could ethics eat people? It is only because knowledge and action are separated that the so-called ethics have long lost the true essence of the sacred Way. Therefore, during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, a Mr. Yan Xizhai severely criticized those false scholars who engaged in empty talk about nature and principles and misunderstood the sacred Way, believing that their crimes were to mislead the people and that the harm they caused was even worse than Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars. Yan Xizhai said that spreading chapters and sentences is not the sacred Way, and competing to advocate empty talk is even less the sacred learning. The true essence of sacred learning is to teach the people to 'practice things,' hence it is said, 'Learning and practicing them constantly,' and 'Diligent practice is close to benevolence.' The two words 'practice' and 'action' are the true essence of sacred learning and the basic effort to implement the sacred Way. The New Life Movement is to implement the inherent moral principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame into the actual lives of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, which is most in line with the true essence of sacred learning and most sufficient to implement the spirit of the sacred Way. Therefore, the New Life Movement is absolutely not empty talk, but practical; not frivolous, but solid; not empty words, but diligent practice. The true essence and basic requirements of the New Life Movement lie in consistency between appearance and reality, consistency between words and actions, unity of heart and mouth, and unity of knowledge and action. For thousands of years, the principles of governing the country and teaching the people of the Chinese sages and worthies have been too numerous to count, but they have all become ornamental empty words and have not been developed into practical actions. Since modern times, the actions of patriots and people with lofty ideals who have run around to save the country have been even more vigorous and sensational for a time, but they have only had a momentary excitement and have not had a lasting force. They have only seen the advocacy of a few leaders and have not been practiced by the general public. Although the reasons for this failure are extremely complex, to summarize, it is due to being frivolous and not practical, so that words and actions cannot be consistent, and knowledge and action cannot be unified. All perfect theories cannot be developed into real power. The leaders of the New Life Movement, in shouldering the mission of their time, promoting the wheel of this movement, and leading the entire nation forward, should deeply remember this historical lesson and not repeat the mistakes of the past. On the anniversary of the New Life Movement, I put forward three hopes. The first hope is that the government should clearly define rewards and punishments and revitalize discipline. The second hope is that the society should clearly distinguish right from wrong and uphold justice. The third hope is that individuals should set an example and sincerely practice diligently. These three hopes are certainly necessary conditions for the success of the New Life Movement and have a related relationship. However, the third point is especially the root of the three, because the New Life Movement, in the most practical sense, is actually a movement of self-awareness and self-renewal. Its main purpose is to encourage the spirit of every citizen, so that they can love themselves, respect themselves, value themselves, be aware of themselves, strengthen themselves, and renew themselves, becoming citizens who strive upward, are enterprising, are self-reliant, and are constantly renewed. Therefore, I hope that every advocate or believer of the New Life Movement must first start from self-transformation, self-training, self-cultivation, self-effort, and self-practice. In this way, the New Life Movement can extend from oneself to others, from near to far, and achieve practical and universal results."</p>
<p>Li Tingan and Others Deliver Speeches in Succession</p>
<p>After Representative Wu delivered his speech, Director Li Tingan delivered a speech, stating, "Today is the third anniversary of the New Life Movement. The meaning of the New Life Movement has been explained in detail by the chairman and the representative of the instructor. I will briefly describe to you my observations. The matter of cleanliness advocated in the New Life Movement seems very simple, but it is of great importance. Cleanliness in the individual is the starting point for seeking personal health. Cleanliness in business is the starting point for seeking great results in business. Cleanliness in the country and society is the starting point for seeking discipline and order in the country and society. In all the guidelines of the New Life Movement, we feel that none are unimportant. In short, the New Life Movement is an essential element for the revival of the nation, so we must strictly follow it." Finally, Director Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech on behalf of Zhang Binghui, stating, "Because of the great importance of the New Life Movement to the nation and the people, the New Life must be promoted to the general public. Now, the Social Bureau not only requires all schools to follow the New Life Movement, but also tries to arouse the attention of the industrial, agricultural, and commercial sectors." Finally, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>In the Afternoon, Divided into Four Groups for Inspection</p>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association divided into four groups in the afternoon to inspect the implementation of the New Life in various institutions, schools, and organizations. The inspection situation will be compiled into a report and stored in the association. In recent years, various institutions, schools, and organizations have been very active in promoting the New Life Movement, so the results have been very good.</p>

<h3>Representatives Attending the Chicago World's Fair Return Home and Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Fujian Province Made a Profit of 30,000 Yuan at the Chicago World's Fair, Discussing in Detail the Inspection of Child Welfare Programs in the United States</p>
<p>Mr. Dong Kunfan, commissioner of Fujian Province's participation in the Chicago World's Fair, and Mr. Dong Guangying, director of public relations for the Products Association, representatives of our country's participation in the Chicago World's Fair, left the United States on January 19 and visited Japan on the way to see the country's education industry. They arrived in Shanghai by boat yesterday. According to Mr. Dong Kunfan, Fujian Province's participation in the Chicago World's Fair, with the Chinese-American silk lacquer statues and other products created by the Fujian Huier Hospital, promoted our country's culture and art, and won high praise from European and American people. The authorities of the Chicago World's Fair rated it as an international top-grade product. The total operating surplus for two years reached about 30,000 yuan in national currency (the expense of soliciting goods in 1934 reached about 19,000 yuan in national currency). Although lacquerware is a handicraft, it accounts for a large proportion of foreign exports. The Japanese lacquer industry has reward and research institutions in the country, as well as industrial and commercial associations, and foreign trade control, and the sales volume is amazing. It is reported that Mr. Dong has a foreign trade plan, but the hospital has been affected by the local economic exhaustion in recent years. At the same time, the hospital affairs are presided over by the current chairman, Mr. Shen Yongtiao, who can't take care of everything, and used about 40,000 yuan of the Chicago World's Fair fund. After the Chicago World's Fair closed, the two gentlemen ran around the United States, on the one hand, to promote our country's culture and art, and to plan the hospital's expansion plan, and on the other hand, to inspect the facilities of child welfare undertakings in the United States, and to investigate the organization of the New York World's Fair. The various groups of overseas Chinese in New York also paid attention and exchanged opinions with the two gentlemen, and wrote a letter, entrusted to the Executive Yuan of the National Government. Mr. Dong Guangying graduated from Shanghai Great China University, and later studied education at the University of Iowa in the United States. According to the two gentlemen, although the education system and social organization of various states in the United States are not completely the same, the national policy of health care is consistent. No matter how remote the countryside is, there are children's health stations to promote the work of maternal and child protection without hesitation. Ten years ago, the infant mortality rate was one hundred per thousand within one week. Through the efforts of the health station, it has been reduced to more than forty per thousand. Now, pregnant women die on the day of childbirth, only four per thousand. At present, American social figures continue to rise up in the movement to eliminate maternal and child mortality, with the aim of achieving the goal of reducing mortality. Since Japan started the Children's Health Consultation Center, the mortality rate of infants and young children has also decreased significantly. The central government is working hard to formulate a national health policy, so as to realize the plan to improve the physical fitness of the people and make them strong and beautiful. Looking back at our country's high mortality rate, it is impossible to calculate. Especially in this extraordinary period, the cultivation of national defense personnel is really urgent. The way of cultivation is to focus on children's health. The two gentlemen had long discussions with experts in various fields in the United States, and observed in many ways, and wrote an outline of the plan for the Children's Health Experimental Station in China, including ten plans from women's pregnancy to children's growth, starting with experiments to find the standard for health work. Ambassador Shi in the United States expressed deep sympathy and wrote a long preface to vigorously promote it. Ambassador Xu in Japan praised it very much and promised to be the initiator, so that domestic people could advocate this work, which is planned to set up a station in Nanjing and proceed step by step.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings Business is Developed</h3>
<p>The Total Amount of Savings Last Year Reached More Than 50 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Last year, the domestic rural Zhaosu, industry and commerce were active, and the government made every effort to rectify, so the financial organization was stable, and the deposits of various banks increased sharply, which has been repeatedly recorded in various newspapers. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, since the Savings business was ordered to be handled by the post office concurrently, because its bureaus are generally set up in various places, and the procedures are also very simple, so the business has developed very rapidly. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired from the bureau that as of the end of December last year, the total amount of savings in various bureaus across the country reached 55,715,765 yuan, including more than 39 million yuan in passbook savings, more than 11 million yuan in term savings, more than 4.7 million yuan in check savings, more than 70,000 yuan in lump-sum deposit savings, and children's savings, because it has only been open for two months, so the number is the smallest, with more than 6,000 yuan.

<h3>Wang Chonghui Speaks of His Excellent Impression of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>President Jiang's Health Recovered; Tooth Extraction Before Returning to Beijing</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, recently went to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session. Due to personal matters, he returned to Shanghai on the 18th. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Wang at his private residence yesterday and recorded the following conversation: "This Third Plenary Session was held in Beijing with more attendees than previous sessions. The impression was very good. Moreover, the Xi'an Incident was completely resolved peacefully before the opening of the plenary session, without any side issues, which is especially a good phenomenon. I returned to Shanghai due to personal matters, so I do not know the details of the proposals and the results of the discussions."</p>
<p>President Jiang's Health Recovered</p>
<p>"President Jiang's health has recovered and his spirits are much better than before. However, the injury to his back and spine has not fully healed. He wears a steel brace to prevent any vibration of the injured bone. Therefore, he cannot sit for long periods and was unable to attend the Third Plenary Session. Mr. Li Zongren originally planned to come north to attend the Third Plenary Session, but he was unable to do so due to pressing political affairs. The proposals he intended to make were also handed over to Mr. Huang Xuchu to take to Beijing and submit to the Congress for discussion. As for the report that Mr. Li Zongren and Mr. Bai Chongxi will come to Beijing in the next few days, I have not heard of it."</p>
<p>Current Japanese Cabinet Understands China</p>
<p>"The current Japanese cabinet's understanding of China is more realistic than in the past. The Japanese Prime Minister, Hayashi Senjuro, repeatedly expressed his intention to be friendly to China in his speeches and answers to questions from members of parliament, and hoped that the governments of China and Japan would become closer day by day, and that the people of the two countries would become more and more intimate. I deeply agree with Prime Minister Hayashi's words. If we want to seek the rapprochement of the two governments, we must first seek the intimacy of the people of the two countries. If the feelings between the people of the two countries are like fire and water, then the two governments will not be able to seek rapprochement. I sincerely hope that Prime Minister Hayashi's words of goodwill toward China will be proved by facts as soon as possible. As for the diplomatic policy of the current Japanese cabinet, there is no concrete decision yet. Before I have studied it, I do not want to make any criticism."</p>
<p>Will Go to Beijing After Tooth Extraction</p>
<p>"After returning to Shanghai, I went to see a doctor yesterday (the 18th) because I had a loose tooth on the left side, and took an X-ray. It was found that the diseased tooth was festering and spreading into my left cheek. Today (the 19th), I went to see a doctor for a nasal ailment and learned that the diseased tooth was related to the nasal ailment. Therefore, I decided to have the diseased tooth extracted within the next few days and then return to Beijing."</p>

<h3>Juxingcheng Bank to Increase Capital</h3>
<p>Capital to Be Increased to 10 Million Yuan; to Be Reorganized as a Limited Company</p>
<p>Juxingcheng Bank is the earliest commercial bank established in Sichuan Province. It was founded by the wealthy merchant Yang of the province and is a limited partnership with a capital of one million yuan. In recent years, its business has been extraordinarily developed. In view of the fact that construction projects in the province are actively underway, in order to enrich the bank's funds and assist in construction, it will increase its capital to ten million yuan and will be reorganized into a joint-stock limited company in accordance with the bank law promulgated by the ministry. The head office is currently planning this. According to information learned from the Shanghai branch, the bank was originally the Juxingcheng Trading Company, which engaged in import and export operations and made considerable profits. In 1915, it was reorganized into a bank. In 1929, it applied to the Ministry of Finance for a license. Its capital of one million yuan was divided into limited and unlimited shares, each half. All unlimited shares were subscribed by the Yang family, and a portion of the limited shares was also subscribed. The remainder was sold to relatives and friends. Over the past twenty years, due to effective management, a solid foundation has been established. Twenty-one branches and offices have been established in Sichuan Province and along the main ports of the Yangtze River. In 1920, 400,000 yuan was allocated and approved by the Ministry of Finance to establish savings, and the scale has been further expanded. Recently, the bank is determined to develop construction in the province, so it has decided to increase its capital by nine million yuan to ten million yuan.</p>
<h3>International Industrial and Traffic Safety Conference Invites Chinese Representatives to Attend</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Office of the First International Industrial and Traffic Safety Conference in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, has repeatedly sent letters inviting the Shanghai Industrial Safety Association to send representatives to participate in the First International Industrial and Traffic Safety Conference to be held in Amsterdam starting on April 20 of this year. It is learned that the conference was initiated and resolved by industrial safety organizations from more than ten countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, and representatives from the International Labor Office at a meeting in London in early 1935. The first international conference will be held in Amsterdam in 1937, inviting governments of various countries and industrial or traffic safety organizations to send representatives to participate. The Dutch representatives were appointed to be responsible for all preparatory matters. In recent years, China's industrial and transportation industries have become increasingly developed, resulting in daily increases. The annual losses from disasters are extremely large. According to estimates from last year, the losses in property alone exceeded 50 million yuan, and the number of deaths and injuries exceeded 10,000, which has a profound and significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. However, disaster prevention work is purely a specialized technology, and there is still a lack of considerable knowledge of this skill in China. It is reported that the Shanghai Industrial Safety Association will hold a meeting on the tenth of this month to discuss the dispatch of representatives to attend.</p>

<h3>The Dispute Over the Exercise of Authority by the Outgoing Spanish Consul Ferreira</h3>
<p>The Consulate Secretary Wei Shengqu Accused Ferreira of Being a Rebel; The Consular Corps Reported to Our Government for a Decision</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency stated that the Spanish expatriates in the city, numbering about 130, originally enjoyed consular jurisdiction. Since the country's Consul General in Shanghai, Ferreira, and Vice Consul La Rakeksi, resigned successively, they have fallen into a state of being unrestrained, and there is nowhere to appeal if they encounter anything. Unexpectedly, Ferreira, the country's Consul General who had already resigned to the Madrid government, suddenly notified the French Concession Patrol (the consulate is on Avenue Joffre) to continue issuing passports to Spain and exercise his authority as Consul General. At the same time, Wei Shengqu, the former secretary of the Spanish Consulate, has been acting as Consul General since Ferreira's resignation, loyal to the Madrid government, so he also notified the French Patrol that Ferreira is now serving the rebel government, but at present, China and most other countries still recognize the Madrid government as representing Spain, so Ferreira's actions have no diplomatic standing, etc. This has caused a fierce dispute between the two sides. The Consular Corps heard the news, and the leader of the corps, the British Consul General, Britanan, also had no way to resolve this problem. He has sent letters to the consuls of various countries and our government, requesting our side to decide how to deal with this matter.</p>

<p>The Shenshi News Agency stated that during the "January 28th" Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai, Major Short, an American aviator traveling in China, was motivated by righteous indignation and could not bear to see innocent women and children in our country being brutally victimized by the undeclared war.

<h3>The Criminals' Conspiracy Process in the Jiangsu Bank Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Long Spying on the Inside Story of Jiangsu Bank; Continued Hearing by the First Special Court Yesterday</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Bank branch on Xinzha Road was robbed by several bandits at 5:00 p.m. on the first of this month, attempting to steal more than 7,000 yuan that was being escorted to the head office. As a result, a shootout occurred between the bank's bodyguards and the robbers. Shi Jinzhi, a watchman of the bank's Security Office No. 194, was shot and killed, and bodyguards Jiang Ziqin and Gu Wenlin and rickshaw puller Chen Youru were all shot and injured. One of the robbers was also shot, so they failed to steal the money.</p>
<p>Abandoning a Gun</p>
<p>And Fleeing; afterwards, the Hua Chief Inspector of the Laoza Gate Patrol Room, You A'gen, Detective Wang Shanqing, Ye Yusi, detective Zhu Shanghe, etc., found the robbers Chen Changfu, Chen Li's, Zhang Shaoqing, Zhao Jinrong, Zhao Youren, Bai Fugui, Qian A'rong, Bao Hemen, Shi A'mao, Xiang Renlin, Yang Yuchun, etc., a total of eleven people, and seized two guns, many bullets, and a cane gun at 44 Lane 353, Xinzha Road and 920 Hart Road. They were handed over to the First Special District</p>
<p>Court for Interrogation and Detention</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, this case was continued by Judge Feng Shide in the first criminal division. The patrol room's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the patrol room is now requesting the release of Chen Li's and He Chunlin because it has been found that they have no direct relationship. He also requested the disposal of the household appliances, etc., seized in the robbers' den. Judge Feng then ordered Chen Li's and He Chunlin to be released. The seized furniture, etc., should be temporarily stored in the patrol room. If it is inconvenient to preserve them, they should be allowed to be auctioned off, and the</p>
<p>Sale Price Paid to the Court</p>
<p>Lawyer Ru continued to state that, in addition to the Jiangsu Bank case, the defendants were also involved in ㊀ the robbery of Ding Zihua's property worth 576 yuan at 39 Lane 997, Haining Road, at 6:15 p.m. on January 9; ㊁ the robbery of He Qingsheng's house at 45 Hexing Lane, Wuzhou Road, for 100 yuan at 7:30 p.m. on December 23 last year. Now, he first stated the Jiangsu Bank case. The reason is that the defendant Chen Changfu, with Zhang Zhensheng, who is at large, came to Shanghai with two guns at the beginning of last month and met a Mr. Ren, who used to run a car dealership. Ren also had a gun, so they</p>
<p>Conspired to Rob</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Bank, so Chen rented 4 Lane 353, Xinzha Road, about 30 yards away from the bank, to find out the truth. Later, Chen learned that the bank must have a large amount of money delivered to the head office every day at 5:00 p.m., but the bank has watchmen and bodyguards guarding the delivery, and there is also a Chinese patrol station on the Zhenlu Bridge pier opposite the bank, so if they have to take action, it must be with a large number of people. So he invited Zhang Shaoqing, Zhao Jinrong, Zhao Youren, Bai Fugui, and the fleeing Lao Wei, Li Kunshan, to join them. Bai</p>
<p>Has His Own Gun</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. on the 3rd, Zhao Jinrong, Mr. Ren, and Ren's concubine A'ying rented a car No. 12314 from Yunfei Car Company and drove to Lincoln Road. Zhao immediately took out a gun and drove the driver Yao A'nan down. Zhao Youren and Li Kunshan, who were waiting there, tied him up and robbed him of 8 and a half yuan of banknotes in Yao's pocket. Then Ren drove the car straight to the scene of the incident, stipulating that Zhang Shaoqing would rob the money, Zhao Jinrong would deal with the watchman, Zhang Zhensheng would deal with the bodyguard, Bai Fugui would monitor the Chinese patrol on the bridge pier, and Ren would act as the driver. When Zhu Renhai</p>
<p>Carries the Money Out</p>
<p>They opened fire separately. As a result, Zhao killed the watchman, Zhang Shaoqing injured the rickshaw puller, Chen Youhai injured Gu Wenlin, and Zhang Shaoqing was also shot and injured, but Zhu Renhai fled to a woman's house after seeing the robbers firing, and the money was spared from being robbed. Now, each defendant has written a confession and should be interrogated. The court questioned the witness Yao A'nan once. As it was almost noon, there was not enough time to continue the interrogation, so it was decided to reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3>Wife Filed for Divorce Due to Husband's Drug Addiction</h3>
<p>The Debate Has Ended and a Date Has Been Set for the Verdict</p>
<p>Zhu Weixiang, a native of Haimen, is currently 36 years old and works as the head of a rickshaw at Yongfeng Brick and Tile Company, No. 366, Rue Siccawei in the French Concession. He first married a woman surnamed Chen from the same hometown, and after Chen's death, he married another woman surnamed Zhang from the same hometown as his step-wife. Then, in January of 1930, he took a woman named Wu Xiuzhen (26 years old this year) from the same hometown as a concubine and lived with her until now. She gave birth to a boy, who is 5 years old this year, and lives with Zhu in Shanghai, while Zhang lives in the countryside. Recently, Wu Xiuzhen believes that Zhu is addicted to drugs, so his monthly income is not enough for the family's living expenses. There are often disputes between husband and concubine, and their relationship has broken down. Wu Xiuzhen, unbearable to live with him to grow old, left Zhu's residence and temporarily resided at her relative's place at No. 3 Avenue Joffre. On the one hand, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Special Court's Civil Division against Zhu for the termination of their cohabitation agreement. According to the lawsuit, the court notified the defendant, who also hired lawyer Tang Hao to file a defense, and raised the issue that the court had no jurisdiction over the plaintiff's status as a concubine in Haimen. The case was heard once and then rescheduled. Yesterday, Judge Li Liang continued the hearing in Civil Division Seven. The plaintiff arrived with her lawyer, but the defendant and his lawyer did not. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the defendant has been legally summoned several times and has not appeared. Because he is addicted to morphine, he was previously sentenced to one month in prison by the court. He does not know how to repent, but goes a step further and sells drugs, fearing punishment, so he dare not appear in court. He requested permission to hold a unilateral debate and render a judgment. The court also summoned the witness Zhang Baoliang to testify about the defendant's marriage to his cousin Zhang. According to the testimony, his cousin has not returned to her natal home since she married Zhu Jixiang and is now in the countryside. After verifying the situation, the court declared the debate closed and set a date for the verdict.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Li Jichuan Accused of Seduction</h3>
<p>Qu Yinong Was Angry Because She Was Insulted and Glared at Li When She Left the Court</p>
<p>Lawyer Li Jichuan, residing at No. 12, Xixiang Kang Lane, Maibige Road, was residing at Yongfeng Fang, North Sichuan Road, between the autumn and winter of last year. Qu Yinsong, a youthful and beautiful woman from Guangdong married to Feng Weichen, a Cantonese, suspected that Li was having an affair with her. After Feng discovered Li's love letter to Qu, he hired a lawyer to file a</p>
<p>Criminal Private Prosecution</p>
<p>Against Li Jichuan in the First Special District Local Court for Seducing His Wife. During the court hearing, Li denied the alleged facts. He also presented a written agreement of Feng and Qu's cohabitation, claiming that Qu was Feng's concubine. The judge ruled that Feng had no right to file a personal complaint according to the law and dismissed the case. However, Feng was not convinced by the ruling and has appealed to the Second Branch Court. Qu Yinsong's mother, Qu Luo's, was originally in her hometown in eastern Guangdong. Hearing the news that the lawsuit had failed, she</p>
<p>Came to Shanghai from Guangdong</p>
<p>And acting as her daughter's legal guardian, she also hired a lawyer to file a criminal private prosecution with the First Special Court against Li Jichuan for seducing her daughter and causing her to leave her family. She claimed that her daughter was born at Zi hour on the fifth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar in 1918, making her only 19 years old last year. From October 30 to December 21 of last year, Li Jichuan used aliases such as Liang Xing, Zhang Jin, and Wang Zhen to lure her to the</p>
<p>Nanjing Hotel</p>
<p>And New Asia Hotel. She slept with him for six times in a row, making it impossible for the plaintiff to supervise her, which constitutes a crime under Article 240, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shijie opened the court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Qu Luo's, through her representative lawyer, finished stating the intention of the lawsuit. Then Qu Yinsong testified that she married Feng at the age of sixteen in the</p>
<p>Dongyang Buddhist Hall</p>
<p>The wedding was held at the Old Bazi Road, and the wedding officiant was a Dongyang pastor. She then recounted the time and place of her six adulterous affairs with Li Jichuan. Finally, she said that her husband only found out after discovering the love letter that Li gave her and firmly denied that she was Feng's concubine. When the court questioned the defendant, Li Jichuan, he absolutely denied having any adultery or communication with Qu and claimed that he was being</p>
<p>Framed Due to a Grudge</p>
<p>Etc. Afterwards, the lawyers for both the plaintiff and the defendant debated each other to the end. The court then decided to set a date for sentencing next Friday morning. When Qu Yinsong was leaving the witness stand and passing in front of Li Jichuan, she could not help but widen her almond eyes and glare at Li. Her cherry lips were also trembling frequently. This kind of posture was especially beautiful.</p>
<h3>Yang Ruisheng Kidnapping Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>Yang Ruisheng, owner of Yang Rui Construction Company at No. 15, Lane 332, West Soochow Road, was kidnapped on the morning of January 9th at the entrance of the lane, with a ransom of 60,000 yuan demanded. Subsequently, the authorities of the two districts of Shanghai and Nanhui cracked the case, arresting six kidnappers: Lu Mufa, Diao Hailin, Fei Wangshi, Wang Changsheng, Hua Mutan, and Diao Mulin.

<h3>Asiatic Petroleum Company's Chinese Staff Donates Funds to Aid Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Although the Suiyuan war has temporarily calmed down, the bandits will certainly not give up easily. The enemy is currently busy reorganizing and training, actively preparing for another invasion. It is believed that the enemy's third invasion will be the biggest crisis in Suiyuan Province. Therefore, our frontline preparations seem to be fading away along with the silence of the frontline. Now, the Chinese staff and workers of the Asiatic Petroleum Company have stepped forward, voluntarily donating 800.05 yuan in legal tender, which has been handed over to the Shanghai Wentong Bank for remittance to the front lines. This is enough to arouse public sentiment for continuing to aid Suiyuan. It is hoped that all sectors will strive together.</p>

<h3>Abundant New and Old Copper Coins, Exchange Rate Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>The Tobacco Exchange Industry Consults with the Central Bank and Revises the Method of Issuing Subsidiary Coins</p>
<p>At the end of the lunar year, the national currency price in this city fluctuated because of the shortage of old copper coins. It was rumored that some people were monopolizing and manipulating the market, causing the exchange rate to shrink and become inconsistent. For the sake of stabilizing the exchange rate, the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association consulted with the Central Bank and agreed to distribute 55 boxes of new copper subsidiary coins, totaling 11,000 yuan in national currency, to its members throughout the city every day to facilitate exchange. At that time, the mint did not ship many coins, and it was still felt that the supply was insufficient. However, since the Lunar New Year, it has been observed that the supply of new and old copper coins on the market has gradually become abundant, and the income from door-to-door sales and exchanges is sufficient to meet the demand, so the exchange rate has also stabilized. Chen Liangyu, chairman of the Tobacco Exchange Association, re-negotiated with the Central Bank a few days ago to change the exchange date, temporarily setting it on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and distributing the coins as usual. The Shanghai South Office of the Association announced yesterday that "In order to facilitate the exchange of one-cent new copper subsidiary coins for the benefit of members, the Association previously consulted with the Central Bank and originally planned to entrust the Association to distribute 55 boxes to members, totaling 11,000 yuan, every day. Members were to go to the Association to exchange coins at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM every day. Now, because new and old copper coins are abundant, the method has been revised again. For the time being, the coins will still be distributed as usual on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays according to the original amount. Those South Shanghai members who wish to exchange coins should register and pay the fee at the office at No. 427, Fumin Road, Dananmenkou, before 12:00 PM every day according to the stipulated date, so that the quota can be determined and received on time. No handling fee will be charged. Please be informed. This is a special announcement."</p>
<h3>Telegraph Bureau Revokes Broadcasting Licenses of Eight Radio Stations</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Radio Station Increases Power</p>

The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau specifically issued a notice yesterday saying, "This Bureau has been ordered by the Ministry to revoke the licenses previously issued to the following eight broadcasting stations in this city: Tongle (XLHO.72.OK,C), Zhou Xiejie (XLHn760K.C.), Dunben (XLHL800K.C), Anding (XHHO,800K.O., Shiyin (XHHR134OK.C.), Xinsheng (XLHF,138OK,C), Huiling (XLHF138,OK,C), and Huaguang (XQHF,148,OKC), and to recover the call signs and frequencies previously used by these stations. We have already complied with the order and notified the stations. In addition, we are issuing another notice that the licenses of these eight stations will be invalidated from February 1st of this year. Furthermore, no one may arbitrarily use the seven call signs and frequencies listed above without the approval of the Ministry of Communications, so as not to violate the law." In addition, in view of the poor management of some private radio broadcasting stations, the Ministry of Communications has specially improved the Ministry-operated Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications. Recently, two iron pole towers have been built at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, and the power of the antenna has been increased from 500 kilowatts to 2,000 kilowatts.</p>
<h3>Ditch Workers on McLean Road Encroach on Road Workers' Jobs</h3>
<p>Mutual Aid Association Asks for Investigation and Prevention</p>
<p>Although the Municipal Council has declared that the road workers in the Public Concession will not be reduced, and the situation is gradually stabilizing, the encroachment of ditch workers on road workers' jobs has recently occurred again. The Road Workers' Mutual Aid Association has specially written to the Municipal Council to stop this. The original letter stated, "We are deeply gratified to see the report stating that the Council has declared that it will not reduce the number of road workers. However, in the past, road workers and ditch workers each had their own specific jobs and did not encroach on each other. However, recently, the encroachment of ditch workers on road workers' jobs has occurred. After many negotiations, the problems in most districts have been resolved. However, in the McLean Road district, ditch workers, under the protection of the foreman, continue to encroach on road workers' jobs. Repeated negotiations have been ineffective. In order to maintain their livelihood, the road workers are specially writing to the Council to order the McLean Road Public Works Department to investigate and stop the encroachment on road workers' jobs, so as to avoid disputes. This is what we earnestly pray for."</p>

<h3>Two Austro-Hungarian People Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>Dr. Bumi, an Austrian doctor, has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for several years and currently resides at a certain number on Broadway Building. At 8:00 AM yesterday, he was found by a waiter dead from a gunshot wound in his room. The police are still investigating the cause of his death, but judging from the current situation, it must have been suicide. The deceased has no relatives in Shanghai.

<h3>An Employee of the Bank of Communications Who Stole a Large Sum of Money Was Arrested</h3>
<p>The Legal Tender Was All Stored Inside Two Pillows Made by His Mistress</p>
<p>Wang A'tu, an employee of the Bank of Communications in this port, has been working in the bank for many years. According to the bank's usual practice, if the cash department wants to use money, it must send Wang to Wang Buyuan, the custodian of the vault, to get the money for use. This has become a habit. On the 16th of this month, Wang A'tu took advantage of his position to steal 5,000 yuan in banknotes from Wang Buzhou, the custodian of the vault, and fled his job with the money. After the Bank of Communications found out, it reported the case to the General Police Department and offered a reward of 1,000 yuan for his arrest. The other day, Chinese detective Peng Jixiang learned that Wang A'tu's mistress, Tang Chuan, from Ningbo, lived at No. 21, Tongle Lane, Oujia Road, and arrested her. Then, according to Tang's confession, together with detectives from the Nanshi Police Department, Wang A'tu was arrested in Dingxin Lane, Wengjia Lane, and temporarily detained at the police station, pending a written transfer order. On the other hand, according to Tang's confession, all the banknotes were stored in two pillows specially made by Tang and hidden in a friend's house at No. 335, Yuanfang Road.

<p>Lu Chongren, Director of the Yunnan Department of Finance, in view of the fact that the tea-producing areas of Yunnan are mostly left to their natural state and do not know how to improve, making it difficult to sell them in various places, the Department recently sent Bai Mengyu, Director of the Special Consumption Bureau of Simao District, to Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and other places to investigate tea-making methods for reference.

<p>Meeting with Various Parties to Discuss the Construction of Huangshan</p>
<p>Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Department of Construction and Member of the Huangshan Construction Committee, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Anhui. A reporter from Dagongbao interviewed him at the representative office of the committee in Shanghai. According to him, this trip to Shanghai is to meet with various parties to discuss the construction of Huangshan.

<h3>Water Levels Rise in Changsha, Hunan Shipping Route Reopens</h3>
<p>Grain from Changsha Can Be Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Since October of last year, the route from Shanghai to Changsha has been blocked due to the shallow waters of the Xiang River, which fell to two inches below the bottom, resulting in the disruption of the route between Changsha and Shanghai. Passengers and cargo between Shanghai and Hunan were first transshipped by private boats in Lulintan, and then transshipped in Yuezhou. Due to the shallow waters, it was difficult to transport, resulting in the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cargo destined for Hunan in Hankou, Yuezhou, and other places. Recently, Hunan cargo merchants have come to Shanghai from Changsha in large numbers to start purchasing goods. The local shipping companies have also received telegrams from Changsha stating that the water level of the Xiang River has risen sharply in recent days, and shipping from Hankou to Changsha can be resumed. Shallow-draft river vessels can now pass unimpeded. The large amount of grain accumulated in Changsha and the cargo accumulated in Yuezhou and Hankou have already been loaded onto ships sent by the various shipping companies. The shallow water fees on this route have also been reduced.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Office Explains Collection Doubts</h3>
<p>The Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance received an official letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on letters from the Egg Industry and Dye Industry Associations, requesting explanations on various points of doubt regarding income tax, which were explained separately as follows: A. Part of the request for explanation from the Shanghai Egg Industry Association: 1. In accordance with the customs of industry and commerce, employers usually provide food and lodging for laborers and low-level shop assistants. Therefore, those whose monthly salaries are less than 30 yuan will be temporarily exempt from tax on food and lodging provided by the employer. The rest will be taxed uniformly. 2. The expenses incurred by employees due to business, which are actually paid for each job, do not fall within the scope of salary and should be exempt from tax. 3. If the monthly salary income of drivers and cooks reaches 30 yuan, the employer shall withhold income tax. B. Part of the request for explanation from the Shanghai Dye Industry Association: 1. Profit-making enterprises shall settle accounts once a year. The beginning and ending dates of the business year, that is, the so-called settlement period of the association, shall be determined by the operators themselves. There are no explicit restrictions in the regulations and detailed rules. For example, if the business year starts on January 1st of this year, it will be a business year until the end of February of the following year, and the taxable amount will be calculated based on the net profit of this year. However, in the first year of income tax collection, if the start date of the business year is in 1936, and the end date is after the month and day of 1937, the profits from the beginning of January 1937 shall be calculated and taxed in accordance with Item 7 of the Draft Notice on the Collection of Income Tax on First-Category Profit-Making Enterprises if there is income. Those without income will not be taxed. 2. According to Article 3 of the Provisional Income Tax Law, those whose income is less than 5% of the actual amount of capital will not be taxed. 3. If the capital and business of the head office and branch office are completely independent, the income amount shall be calculated separately. If the capital of the branch office is allocated by the head office, and the final settlement of profit and loss is still the head office, it cannot be considered that the capital and business are completely independent, and the income shall not be subject to the separate calculation regulations.</p>
<h3>Biography of Vice Admiral Limigu, Commander of the French Far East Fleet</h3>

<h3>Ningbo Fellow Association Sends Telegram to the Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>Requesting the Addition of Stations in Tang, Yang, and Zhang</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has the news that it will lay railway tracks from the Baisha Machinery Factory in Ningbo to the Sanbei Wharf in Zhenhai to facilitate transportation. However, Tang, Yang, and Zhang are located in a strategic location. Wang Lihe, the representative of the citizens of the town, sent a letter to the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai, advocating the addition of a station in the town. According to the information, the association telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to adopt it. The telegram said, "Zhang Diao Jian, Minister of the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, according to the letter from Wang Lihe, the representative of the citizens of Tang, Yang, and Zhang towns in our hometown, it is heard that the Ministry of Railways will build a railway from the Baisha Machinery Factory in Ningbo directly to the Sanbei Wharf in Zhenhai. This is not only of great significance in national defense, but also greatly facilitates commercial transportation and travel. However, the road only has one station in Hantang Street. The merchants, etc., believe that the distance is too far. The Tang, Yang, and Zhang areas are located in the center of the road, and the residents in the area reach more than 10,000 households, and the four sides are accessible, which is an extremely important place. It is necessary to add stations. For this reason, I implore your association to advocate, and please forward it to the Ministry of Railways, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration to allow the establishment of stations on the Tangyangzhang Road to facilitate the public, which is deeply appreciated, and other circumstances. After investigating the town, it is located in an important place, and the people are crowded and dense. The public request of the town to add stations is a very necessary request. Therefore, the facts are telegraphed to Chen Jianhe, and Fusi will be adopted and implemented, which is deeply desired. Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai, Yu Hede, etc., salute."</p>

<h3>Attempted Robbery at Tanziwan Nanhua Store</h3>
<p>Store Owner Seizes Handgun and Bullets</p>
<p>Wang Shunxing, a double-fronted Nanhua (Southern Goods), cigarette paper, and sundry goods store located at No. 319 and 321 Tanziwan in Zhabei, is owned by Wang Guoxiang (age 47) from Jiading. The business is doing well, attracting the attention of robbers. Yesterday morning at 2:40 AM, Wang and his family were asleep when they heard someone knocking on the door. Initially, they thought it was a customer with an urgent need to buy something, so Wang got out of bed and opened the door. Unexpectedly, two robbers wearing black short jackets and speaking a Jiangbei dialect barged in. One robber brandished a handgun and warned them not to make a sound. Wang Guoxiang knew they were robbers, so he acted quickly, grabbed the hand of the robber holding the gun with both hands, and shouted for robbers. The other people in the store also got up. It turned out that the robbers only had one handgun. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, they threw the handgun on the ground and tried to escape. At this time, the police officers from the Tanziwan Police Station also arrived after hearing the commotion. They reported to Inspector Luo Siwei, who led police officers to the scene. They found that the robbers had first dug a hole in the vacant room at No. 317 next door, intending to enter through the kitchen, but were unable to. They then knocked on the front door. The handgun was a five-round revolver, numbered 46163, with four live rounds. Yesterday, the police station reported the case to the News Bureau with the handgun and four bullets. Wang Guoxiang, the store owner, was questioned, and the case was reported to the Police Department's Inspectorate for the record.</p>
<h3>Wei Zhongxiu and Others Sent to the First Special Court</h3>
<p>Wei Zhongxiu, formerly known as Wei Songfeng, the head of the detective team of the former Shanghai Songhu Police Department, Zhang Xixiang, a detective of the Xinghui Public Security Bureau, Dong Yinxuan, who had worked as a comprador for a shipping company, and Wu Acai, were involved in a case where they had people take two handguns stored in a car to the Bund and report secretly to an important person that there were reactionary cadres plotting to assassinate them. After the driver reported to the police, Wei and the other three were arrested. After investigation, it was determined that they had fabricated the scheme to gain credit and rewards. They were sent to the First Special District Court, which sentenced Wei, Zhang, and Dong to two years in prison each, and Wu to one year. The Public Security Bureau, fearing that they might have been planning an actual assassination, conducted an investigation for more than ten months. Considering that Wei and the others had been detained for 15 months, Wu Acai had already served his full term. The Public Security Bureau also determined that there was no actual assassination plot. Therefore, they were transferred to the local court for custody the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the prosecutor's office sent police to transfer Wei and the other three to the First Special Court for the execution of their sentences.</p>
<h3>Fire at Deshun Fireworks Store Caused by "Slam Bangs"</h3>
<p>Customer Flees the Scene</p>
<p>The Deshun Fireworks Store at No. 118 Wangjia Wharf in Nanshi caught fire at around 8:00 AM yesterday. A customer came to buy a large quantity of "slam bangs" (a type of small firework). The owner, Gu Songlin, showed him a large bundle of "slam bangs," and they began to discuss the price. However, the customer offered too low a price, and the two began to argue. Unexpectedly, the customer, angered by the situation, threw the "slam bangs" into the store, causing them to explode. The firecrackers and "slam bangs" piled inside were knocked over and also exploded, causing a fire. Fortunately, fire trucks from various fire brigades arrived and put out the fire. Only half of the store was burned down, and the fire did not spread further. However, the customer, seeing that he had caused the fire, immediately fled the scene.</p>
<h3>Zhengyi Society Rehearsal</h3>
<p>Soliciting Domestic Goods to Enhance Festivities</p>
<p>The Zhengyi Society, located on the seventh floor of the Continental Department Store on Nanjing Road, is an upscale club organized by industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai. To celebrate the New Year, they will hold a New Year's Eve gathering for members on the 25th of this month (Lunar New Year's Day) at 6:00 PM. The drama department of the society is rehearsing Peking opera to add to the fun. It is said that various domestic goods organizations in Shanghai, such as the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods, the China National Products Marketing Association, and the executive directors of the China National Products Company, are mostly members of the society. To encourage members to use domestic goods, these organizations have sent letters to major domestic goods factories, soliciting exquisite products to be distributed to the members attending the gathering. According to Mr. Xu Jianruo, the person in charge of soliciting gifts for the society, they have received very valuable gifts from various factories in recent days, including a chrome-plated steel sofa from the Dahua Iron Factory, velvet cheongsam dresses from the Meya Silk Weaving Factory, exquisite toys from the Kangyuan Factory, woolens from the Zhanghua Factory, electrical appliances from the Huasheng Factory, a pocket billiard set donated by member Wang Jingshan, and calligraphy scrolls from Yang Chuqiao, Yan Mengfan, and Fu Tienian.</p>
<h3>The Relief Society Rescues a Religious Friend</h3>
<p>Zhang Chen, a standing committee member of the Chinese Christian Church, has been in charge of the organization of religious groups since receiving orders from the central government, and has also served as the director of the Shanghai office. He has a considerable record of defending the clergy. Whenever there are cases of false accusations, he always speaks out to exonerate the victims. Recently, Hu Kaifa, director of the Shanghai Faxin Church, along with the family of church member Zhou Yuqing, reported that Zhou Yuqing, originally from Rugao, had been working as a carpenter in Shanghai, but had returned to his hometown after being unemployed for a long time. He was accused of being a traitor by the Rugao Security Bureau and detained by the county government. More than fifty local baojia leaders jointly guaranteed his release, but to no avail. They came to Shanghai to seek help. Zhang, upon receiving the report, immediately sent an official letter to the Rugao County government, proving that Zhou Yuqing was a church member and had no treasonous behavior, and requested his release. He then received a reply from the Rugao County government, No. 281, stating that one foreign coin and three pages of notes and five copper coins had been found during the search, and that they were investigating the case with the county party headquarters. After receiving the letter, he continued to send letters to the party and government organs of the county, and provided explanations. He also inquired about the situation by telegram, but was told that they had not received orders from the province and could not release him. He then petitioned the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the release. Yesterday, he received a letter from the Rugao County government, No. 353, stating that Zhou Yuqing, a suspected traitor arrested in the county, had been found to have no suspicion of treason based on the previous letters from the church, and had been released on bail after the situation was reported. This is a great stroke of luck that Zhou could be released from his wrongful imprisonment thanks to Zhang's reasonable explanation.</p>
<h3>Dry Cleaning Expert Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Mao, a Chinese national, has been engaged in research on dry cleaning technology in the United Kingdom for many years. He has invented various washing agents and methods for cleaning and restoring cotton, wool, and silk fabrics. After repeated experiments, all have been successfully completed. The formulation of his alkaline and acidic agents is based entirely on scientific principles. Therefore, not only does it not damage the quality of the raw materials, but it can also maintain the original color and style. The British Laundry Research Association authorities praised him highly at the time. However, Mr. Mao is determined to innovate the dry cleaning technology in China and promote the latest machine dry cleaning methods. This year, he resolutely returned to China and established the Chenguang Dry Cleaning Store at No. 644-646 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. He has ordered a complete set of giant dry cleaning machines from the United Kingdom and hired senior technicians from various countries to serve all sectors of the city. For the convenience of customers, he has set up a pick-up and delivery department with the telephone number 72357.</p>

<h3>Unity and Peace (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Since everyone needs peace, how do we seek it? Unity. Only unity can achieve peace. Why? To answer this question, we must first understand the reasons for the lack of peace and the occurrence of war. The reason for the lack of peace and the occurrence of war is due to division. The east is divided, and the west is divided. You want to be the leader of this place, and he wants to be the overlord of that place. They each claim hegemony and do not yield to each other, so wars occur. From the Xinhai Revolution to the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, why was there constant warfare every year? In the final analysis, it was because the forces of division were stirring, rising and falling. If this traditional feudal concept and separatist ideology are not transformed, our country will certainly not be peaceful. Everyone has read the history of our country and knows that this situation is called the division of heroes. The opening remarks of Romance of the Three Kingdoms say: "The general trend of the world, after a long period of division, will unite; after a long period of unity, will divide." These eight words can encompass China's history for thousands of years. We hope that this will not happen again in the future, that is, we hope that unity will be permanent and will not be divided again. According to past history, whenever there is a period of division, there will be years of war, natural disasters, and man-made disasters, and the people will not be able to live. Whenever there is a period of unity, the country will be prosperous, and its prestige will be far-reaching. Let us look at the era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, what prestige the country had. Looking at the era of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, what dignity the country had. On the contrary, what was China like during the Sixteen Kingdoms period of the Five Hu? What was China like during the Northern and Southern Dynasties? When heroes are divided, the people are devastated. When the country is unified, culture and education are spread far and wide. Therefore, if we want peace, we must first have unity. Only after Li Shimin unified did the prosperous age of Zhenguan in the early Tang Dynasty occur. Only after Zhu Yuanzhang unified did the peaceful rule of Hongwu in the early Ming Dynasty occur. Historical lessons clearly tell us that our country needs peace only through unity, and peace can be achieved after unity. Apart from those who have lost their sanity, no one would say that division can bring peace.</p>
<p>According to my explanation, peace and unity are not equal. Peace is our goal. What method do we use to achieve our goal? We use the method of unity to seek peace. So peace is the goal, and unity is the method. Using the method of unity to seek peace is true peace and lasting peace. No one dares to guarantee that peace is eternal, but we always hope that peace can be maintained for a longer period. If we do not use a truly unified method to seek peace, it is a superficial, paper-thin fake peace that will soon be exposed. For example, after the Liangguang Incident, everyone thought there was peace, but who knew there would be the Xi'an Incident? It can be seen that without achieving true unity, there will be no true peace.</p>
<p>Why was Japan able to achieve peace after the Meiji Restoration? It should be known that before the Restoration, Japan was also in decline, just like China now, subject to the shackles of unequal treaties, the oppression of Western imperialism, and even its status was not as good as that of China at that time. Why was it able to transform to its current position in the sixty or seventy years after the Restoration? Its foundation was completely built on the abolition of the feudal domain system during the Meiji Restoration. In the past, Japan's national power was dispersed in the hands of feudal lords, which was tantamount to division. Because of the extensive feudal movement, the power held by the feudal lords who were in control of the separation was concentrated to the central government, and then the country was unified by the establishment of the king's power. Because the country was unified, then there was peace, strength, and the ability to step onto the stage of modern countries. Therefore, the abolition of the feudal domain system was the unified national salvation movement of the Japanese Meiji Restoration. Bismarck's assistance to William I in establishing the German Federation was the unified national salvation movement of Germany. The establishment of the Kingdom of Italy by the three heroes, Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi, was the unified national salvation movement of Italy. History is there, and it can be reviewed.</p>
<p>Speaking of Japan, why was it able to promote this abolition of the feudal domain system? Everyone knows that the Meiji Restoration learned the new laws of the West, but on what basis did it learn the new laws of the West? To be honest, it learned the new laws of the West on the basis of Sinology. The so-called foundation of Sinology is the learning of Mr. Wang Yangming, a great Confucian scholar of the Ming Dynasty in China. Japan took this learning as the foundation of its restoration, upheld the spirit of "revering the king and expelling the barbarians," and resisted foreign insults. It was under the spirit of these four words that it was revived. Is "revering the king and expelling the barbarians" an inherent spirit of Japan? No. This is China's inherent treasure. Confucius compiled the Spring and Autumn Annals, expressing the spirit of "revering the king and expelling the barbarians." Because it was the decline of the Zhou Dynasty and the rise of the princes, and the royal family was weak, Confucius advocated "revering the king." The Spring and Autumn Annals specially wrote about the first month of the spring king, which was to honor the correct calendar of the Zhou king. The so-called "expelling the barbarians" is to resist foreign barbarians. Confucius had made several impolite criticisms of Guan Zhong, such as "Guan Zhong's instrument is small!" "If Guan Zhong knows etiquette, who does not know etiquette?" But on one occasion, Confucius sighed: "Without Guan Zhong, I would have to wear my hair disheveled and my lapel to the left." So he said that he was "benevolent! He was benevolent!" What benevolence was it? It was the benevolence of uniting the princes and correcting the world, which is also the benevolence of "revering the king and expelling the barbarians." It can be seen that "revering the king and expelling the barbarians" is China's inherent treasure. Japan was able to learn this spirit, so it was able to revive.</p>
<p>Do not think that I am turning over antiques here. The autocratic king is certainly no longer there, but a country always has a "central" authority. Now we cannot say "revering the king," but we should say uniting under the central authority. Now that there is international equality and global communication, we can no longer say "expelling the barbarians," but "resisting the enemy" can be said. So "expelling the barbarians" is "resisting the enemy." If foreigners do not become our enemies, they should of course be friends; if they must become our enemies, we must resist. So in modern terms, "revering the king" is "unity," and "expelling the barbarians" is "resisting the enemy." We must also revive the Chinese nation based on the spirit of these four words. The Japanese Meiji Restoration is a very good example.</p>
<p>It should be known that these four words "revering the king and expelling the barbarians" cannot be reversed. From the literal meaning, "revering the king and expelling the barbarians" and "expelling the barbarians and revering the king" seem to be no different, but in fact, the order contains the most profound principles. Only by revering the king can we expel the barbarians, only by internal unity can we resist foreign enemies. This is a matter of course. Let me extend another sentence: unity is internal stability, and resisting the enemy is external defense. We must first stabilize internally and then defend externally. Unity leads to the result of peace, which is internal stability. Peace allows us to accumulate strength to resist the enemy, which is external defense. Therefore, resisting the enemy after unity is true resistance, and it is resistance with strength. This is also an unbreakable truth.</p>
<p>Now let's review the situation in China in the last hundred years. The history of the last hundred years tells us not to complain about anyone, because this is the inevitability of the historical evolution of China. It should be known why the Xinhai Revolution succeeded so quickly. Of course, it relied on the propaganda of revolutionary doctrine, but in the late Qing Dynasty, anti-Manchuism and the Three People's Principles still relied on secret propaganda, and not many people necessarily knew about them. Why did the Republic of China come into being shortly after the Wuchang Uprising? It was because the success of the local separatist forces representing the landlords and gentry in overthrowing the central monarchy before China embarked on a capitalist production system. According to the research of insightful historians and sociologists, since Qin Shihuang unified China, commercial capital has developed day by day, causing rural production to decline and farmers to lose their jobs. At a certain stage, the number of unemployed farmers increased, and there was no way to deal with it, so peasant revolts occurred. These peasant revolts could cause the long-unified situation to be re-divided, becoming the division of heroes. After the division, we seek unity again, and it becomes a unified situation. Therefore, the history of thousands of years has been circulating in these six words "after a long period of unity, there will be division; after a long period of division, there will be unity" no less than seven or eight times. The rapid success of the revolution at the end of the Manchu Qing Dynasty can be said to be mostly due to this historical cycle.</p>

<h3>Yarn</h3>
<p>Warehouse stock of yarn increases daily, spot yarn declines this month</p>
<p>Speculators rolled positions into March, thus the price rose 1.70 yuan; forward prices consequently improved; Sichuan merchants purchase fine yarn.</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the overall trend is stabilizing. The downward trend in the three-grade yarn market has subsided. At the same time, spot yarn sales are still holding up, and Sichuan merchants are actively purchasing fine yarn, boosting market sentiment. Many parties are rolling spot positions from February into March, so the March contract alone rose 1.70 yuan. However, industry players generally expect prices to fall, and warehouse stocks of yarn have exceeded 20,000 bales by the end of this month. It is estimated that deliveries for the February contract will be around 25,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Marked Yarn Prices Fall This Month</h3>
<p>The opening prices of marked yarn contracts, except for the current month, showed a slight increase due to the sharp decline at yesterday's close. However, warehouse stocks are increasing daily, approaching 20,000 bales, leading to a bleak sentiment among industry players. However, Indian merchants and securities and financial firms firmly held onto their absorbed quantities, resulting in a standoff between the two sides. As a result, all marked yarn contracts rose by 1.49 cents compared to yesterday's closing price, except for the current month contract, which fell by 1 cent. The afternoon opening saw lackluster activity in the current month contract, but the February contract was remarkably firm due to position rolling by speculators. Forward months showed some improvement. After the second session, spot yarn transactions were reportedly still around 2,000 bales, indicating good market sentiment. As a result, all contracts rose again by 4, 5, and 8 cents compared to the morning close, except for the current month, which fell by 4 cents. Sold by: Xincheng 1,400 bales, Yongchang 1,000 bales, Changfeng 2,450 bales, Changji 800 bales, Senkang 600 bales, Runkang 1,100 bales, Dachangcheng 750 bales, Yicheng 650 bales, Dafeng 1,850 bales, Yuda 1,000 bales, Jifeng 500 bales. Bought by: Jinchang 1,000 bales, Daqing 1,250 bales, Gengfeng 2,750 bales, Renfeng 2,550 bales, Shengyuan 1,650 bales, Tonghe 1,050 bales, Xiecheng 800 bales, Xinhua 850 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Still Weak at 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. Statistics show that all merchant groups purchased a total of 1,908 bales throughout the day. Selling prices are stable. The purchase volume of each merchant group is listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Market Activity Lacking</p>
<p>The cotton market is flat, and the atmosphere is peaceful. There is no excitement in the Indian and American cotton markets. Prices fluctuate up and down within 2, 4, and 5 points all day long. Speculators lack enthusiasm, but some see potential due to farmers' reluctance to sell. However, inland inventories are high, and most of the stock has not been shipped out.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Gains Profit Through Covering</p>
<p>The opening prices of marked cotton contracts showed slight increases as yesterday’s closing price had a sharp fall. Yesterday, short positions covered for profit, but the momentum was not very strong due to the weak Indian and American cotton markets overseas and the resulting decline in market sentiment. Furthermore, many in the industry believe that it's only a small profit to sell short. As a result, all marked cotton contracts rose 1.2 cents compared to yesterday's closing price. The afternoon opening saw little progress, and the situation became quiet with sluggish trading. As a result, all contracts rose another 5 points compared to the morning close. Sold by: Dafu 3,400 dan, Deda 1,000 dan, Jifeng 3,800 dan, Hengyi 5,900 dan, Renfeng 2,200 dan, Xiecheng 2,100 dan, Changhe 5,900 dan, Changyu 1,500 dan, Taichang 1,600 dan, Changfeng 1,100 dan, Fukang 2,200 dan, Xincheng 1,300 dan. Bought by: Yuda 4,000 dan, Gengfeng 3,600 dan, Shenji 2,500 dan, Yuan Yi 1,200 dan, Xinhua 1,000 dan, Hexing 2,000 dan, Ruida 1,500 dan, Wangtaixing 17,600 dan, Yongda 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton Mills Watch and Wait</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are extremely slow, factory demand is quiet, and the source is unknown.</p>
<p>Tianjin Flower and Yarn Market Firm</p>
<p>(Tianjin Quick Report) The flower market in Xibei, Tianjin is trending upward. Factories and firms are entering the market due to the start of the new year, which created good sentiment and active market. Gongda Factory bought 500 bales, and Tongcheng Company bought 208 bales, both at 48 yuan. Baoji bought 450 bales at 47.50 yuan. The cotton yarn market is also firm, with prices slightly higher at the start of the new year.</p>
<p>Small Amount of Pledged American Cotton Sold</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices down 3 points to up 1 point. The market was sluggish, and most transactions involved speculators closing out March positions and rolling them into later months. Industry players and foreign firms were buyers, but their actions were offset by local merchants and New Orleans sellers. Speculation was lacking, and most industry players were watching and waiting. Short selling decreased, and a small amount of pledged cotton was sold. Spot demand was quiet, and prices were slightly easier, but the closing was firm. Spot prices fell 1 point, and futures fell 1 point to up 3 points. British cotton spot prices rose 4 points, and futures fell 1 point. Indian cotton initially rose due to scattered purchases by European exporters but then retreated due to speculators closing out positions. Ultimately, active short covering led to another firming. According to the report, Bengal fell 0.25 rupees, Oomra fell 1 rupee, and Broach fell 1 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 19th is: Broach at 221 rupees, Oomra at 203.25 rupees, and Bengal at 178 rupees, all down 0.25 rupees.</p>
<p>Osaka Spot Yarn Prices Plunge</p>
<p>Osaka, 19th dispatch: Spot yarn prices fell 5 to 8 yuan. 16-count Fan brand: 226 yuan, down 7 yuan; 20-count Goldfish brand: 248 yuan; 40-count Five Star brand: 395 yuan, all down 5 yuan; 42-count Pheasant brand: 370 yuan, down 8 yuan. Three-grade futures yarn rose 0.1 to fell 1.1 yuan. Near-month: 240 yuan; distant-month: 240.8 yuan. Cotton futures fell 0.25 to rose 0.15 yuan. Near-month: 72.55 yuan; distant-month: 74.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Dark-Colored Goods Continue to Soften</p>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market was slightly weak, due to the sluggishness of both domestic and international cotton markets. Customer demand for spot goods was slow. Warehouses have a very large inventory, and market sentiment is gradually becoming uneasy. East-produced white goods declined slightly (0.025 yuan per piece). Prices of white goods from our factory were stable. Sales of dark-colored goods such as wool fabric, straight-warp drill, and straight-warp satin were slow. Prices for fine wool, [unclear], straight-warp satin, [unclear] floral straight-warp, and our factory's goods have fallen 0.0125 to 0.025 yuan. Bleached cloth, plain and patterned pongee prices generally increased with the new year, but actual sales haven't picked up. New Year business in all regions are only small amounts. Yesterday, Tianjin merchants continued to import nearly 200 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill from Qingdao brands such as Hua Wu. Because dyeing factories have gradually resumed operations, color-cloth dealers in our street have slightly increased their stock. Dealers of East-produced fine cloth and fine twill are also not seeing strong sales, with only 200-300 bales in trade. The factory believes that the auction price of various cloths in Qingdao is too high, and the current month's inventory is exhausted. They have no intention of selling in the long term. Factories and merchants are all observing the actual sales trend after the Lantern Festival to determine their next move.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>As Month-End Settlement Approaches, Speculators Gradually Closing Long Positions in Flour</p>
<p>Market Sentiment is Depressed, Falling More Than 0.05 Yuan; Activity by Outside Traders in Distant Months Limits the Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed near-month declines and distant-month stability. Wheat prices in Chicago and Canada increased by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan, while prices in Liverpool saw minor price improvements. At the opening, speculators with long positions in the current month contract were forced to close out their positions due to the upcoming month-end settlement. There was no significant absorption of these positions through actual sales, leading to a depressed market sentiment, similar to what happened in January. The decline was still around 0.05-0.06 yuan. The March contract also fell by 0.04 yuan initially, but later saw minimal trading and recovered by 0.01-0.02 yuan. The April and July contracts saw strong buying by outside traders, and declines were minimal. As a result, the opening price for those months were better by 0.015 yuan. If actual sales in the current month fail to pick up, there is still potential for further declines, because it's impossible to create arbitrage opportunities without actual sales, making it difficult for long positions to close smoothly.</p>
<p>Old Wheat Futures Decline, New Wheat Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market opened with continued declines in all months in the morning. Although wheat prices rose by 0.02-0.03 yuan, market sentiment was weak, and opening prices were depressed. The current month contract fell by 0.1 yuan, March and April fell by 0.06 yuan, June fell by 0.1 yuan, and July fell by 0.05 yuan. Then, despite favorable weather, long positions in distant-month flour pulled the market, and market sentiment improved. Distant months recovered by 0.03-0.06 yuan. According to industry insiders, wheat seedlings are in good condition everywhere this year. If the weather remains favorable, new crops are unlikely to be favorable. Spot wheat prices are falling frequently in the auction market, and factories are increasingly watching and waiting. Fufeng only bought 400-500 bales of Huai'an wheat, priced at 6.50 to 6.52 yuan, about 0.01 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Few Buyers of Early Indica Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for early indica rice continued to be weak. Sales by local merchants are slow, and merchants from Beiyang, the Northwest, and Xiamen have not inquired. Shantou merchants only took 100 bags of red rice. Guangdong merchants made minor purchases. Only local merchants were active, while supplies from the Yangtze River increased daily, with 10,000-20,000 bags arriving daily. Cargoes on the way are abundant, and sellers are eager to sell, so prices continue to fall by 0.03-0.1 yuan. Total sales were 6,274 bags of Jiangxi rice and 565 bags of Hunan rice.</p>
<p>Sales of Thin Rice Also Sluggish</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments arrived from various sources, totaling 23-24 vessels, with approximately 6,700-6,800 shi of cargo. There were more than 20 vessels with thin rice. Local market sales remained sluggish, and sales by the Baowei also stopped. Only Qingdao merchants bought one vessel of thin rice, further weakening the market. Thin rice prices continued to fall by 0.1-0.2 yuan, while thick japonica fell by 0.1 yuan. Supplies of foreign sharp rice and Yinyuan rice were scarce, keeping the prices stable. The future outlook does not appear optimistic.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 27-28 vessels arrived from various locations along the river. Market sales were poor, with little activity. Prices for white japonica fell another 0.1 yuan, early rice barely held its ground, and thin rice fell by 0.06-0.07 yuan. Yangbu Dujia sharp rice fell by a small amount to 0.1 yuan. White Yuan rice loosened, and the prices of other goods were weak.</p>
<p>Heavy Short Selling of Standard Soybean Cake</p>
<p>—Market Still Listless—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for standard soybean cake continued to be listless. Supplies from the Northeast are very high, while sales are poor. Local merchants are watching and waiting, and the market is in a state of oversupply. Furthermore, firms have been heavily short selling for several days, especially paying attention to short selling the distant-month marked oil. The price for the April and May marked oil continued to fall by 0.45 yuan, while the price for marked cake fell by 0.015-0.005 yuan. Near-month oilcake sales were active due to the low price, and spot sales were relatively active, shifting market activity toward stabilization. The price of marked beans fell due to the high inventory of Dalian goods, making the market listless. Prices continued to fall by 0.02-0.04 yuan.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Outstanding Accounts for the Current Month Still at 20 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday's market prices on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange fell significantly. Most trades were position rollovers, and the trend had obviously stagnated. Early in the month, there were still liquidations, but then trading shifted to buying. After a period of stagnation, the market may still move upward. There are only three days left for the February futures contract, and the outstanding balances are still around 20 million, making a squeeze inevitable. Some believe that Chinese and British gold bonds have risen to 95% of face value overseas, and with Sino-British economic cooperation, the outlook is good. Yesterday, there was heavy selling of numbers 10 and 11 at the opening, and short covering on number 47 depressed the market price by as much as 0.1 to 0.6 yuan. Later, number 10 saw some buying, and numbers 43 and 47 were also absorbed, causing the market price to recover slightly. The trend shifted slightly. Jin Chang broke through the 60 yuan mark, reaching 60.08 yuan, a sharp increase of 0.08 yuan. All unified public bonds declined by 0.2 to 0.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was 5.55 million yuan. A comparison of the price results is listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Da Gong Powdered White Sugar Fell 0.02-0.03 Yuan</p>
<p>Domestic Brown Sugar Market Inventory Grows</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and soft. The trade association set the price for 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 22.95 yuan for spot and 7.55 yuan for re-export goods. Number 4 East White sugar re-export goods was priced at 8 yuan, down 0.025 yuan, while number 8 spot was priced at 22.7 yuan, down 0.05 yuan. Other prices remained unchanged. The factory price for fine white sugar was 22.1 yuan for Dahua number 1, with other numbers unchanged.

Xinghua merchants offered over 300 bags of Da Gong powdered white sugar at prices ranging from 20.65 yuan to 20.5 yuan, 20.4 yuan, and 20.3 yuan. Over 100 bags of straight Ge sugar were offered at 15.3 to 15.1 yuan, showing a slight softening. Jian merchants offered dozens of bags of Diao Qing sugar. The sugar was of high quality, priced at 13.6 yuan, up 0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Prepared Goods</h3>
<p>Black Melon Seeds of Smaller Size Selling Well</p>
<p>You Nan Meat Firms Holding Firm</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the upper-grade black melon seeds haven't seen much movement in sales because the price is already high, so the opening price has softened slightly. However, various merchants have already purchased over 1,000 bags of smaller-sized black melon seeds. Whether this can develop will depend on how the sales turn out. Yesterday, several merchants offered two hundred bags of the smaller-sized black melon seeds at 21-20.5 yuan. The transactions were slow. According to customer opinions, there still isn't much stock, and so the price is unlikely to drop soon.</p>
<p>It was said earlier that You Nan meat merchants were determined to hold the price at 48 yuan, but firms were waiting to see. There has been no movement yet. It was heard that the merchants still desire a high price and aren't willing to budge from 48 yuan. If sales pick up, then it wouldn't be difficult for the price to be realized.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Shanghai Silk Sees Limited Trading</p>
<p>Recently, the silk market has been hesitant due to repeated small declines in the Japanese raw silk market overseas and the traditional Chinese New Year. There has been little activity or excitement. As of yesterday, Japanese and American silk prices had gradually risen. The price of Yokohama spot silk remained unchanged from the previous day, while the quick-term contract rose by 8 yuan. New York Japanese silk rose by 1 point for 83 degrees and 2 points for 75 degrees. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk each rose by 1 point, while selling prices on the exchange fell by about 0.5 point for both near and distant month contracts. The Lyon silk market, which was already sluggish, fell slightly by about 1 franc. The Shanghai silk market saw limited trading, with firms maintaining previous rates. 26 bales traded.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>White Tung Oil Prices Rise Rapidly</p>
<p>After the Great Closure, foreign firms in Hankou began purchasing white tung oil, gradually increasing market activity. On the opening day of this week, the sales price to foreign firms increased by 57 yuan per picul, then increased by 0.2 yuan. In recent days, the price for April tung oil has been 57.8 yuan, and the price for spot oil has increased to 58.4 and 58.8 yuan. According to telegrams last night, the price is trending toward 60 yuan, showing a rapid increase. It is also reported that foreign firms have not purchased enough, and even if supplies increase slightly, there will be enough demand to absorb it. Therefore, the future market is still expected to rise.</p>

<h3>How to Cope with Children's Education Expenses?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wanqing</p>
<p>The winter vacation passes quickly, and in the blink of an eye, it's time for school to start again. At this time, I think no parent, unless they are "penniless," wouldn't be making plans for their school-aged children's tuition fees!</p>
<p>The term "tuition fees" is just a general term for "education expenses." If children are "young" or "day students," then they only need to pay a sum of "tuition," and other expenses can be mixed in with daily expenses and other costs, without having to be "categorized separately." However, this is ultimately not a proper method. You must know that children's age is "increasing day by day," and children's education expenses are "rising day by day." Parents' income may be able to get by safely for the time being, but who knows what will happen in the future? Therefore, the best method is still "prevention is better than cure." Here, the author has a few well-known methods that people "cannot do" or "do not want to do" and presents them again for everyone's attention.</p>
<p>1. Preparations after the honeymoon. Newly married couples, after organizing a small family, should not forget to "make plans for unborn children." Because every newly married couple doesn't know when their children will come, or even thinks it's unimportant. Know that it's better to "prepare for a rainy day" than to "dig a well when thirsty." Therefore, all newly married couples, in their daily budget, should include an item for "future children's education expenses," so that each month at the end of the month, they can store this sum of money in a reliable bank. As for the amount, it doesn't have to be fixed; it can be determined according to their current situation. Save more if they can afford it, save less if they can't, and at the end of the year, make a final summary. After the settlement, it can be used as "fixed-term" savings. After that, no matter what, the principle is "do not misappropriate." In this way, when the children are born, it will surely be a considerable sum of money. If, unfortunately, there are no "offspring," then saving every year and transferring this sum to "old-age pension" is also better than nothing.</p>
<p>2. On-time savings after children are born. After the children are born, the parents must save a certain amount of money into the bank every month. When saving, the amount can be determined according to the lowest income situation at the time, because if it is too much, perhaps in the future when their income is less, they will not be able to continue. Fixed term of ten or fifteen years are acceptable. Monthly savings should not be interrupted. In this way, when the children reach the period of higher expenses in middle school, the parents will no longer have to worry, or say, "There is no money, no need to study anymore!"</p>
<p>3. Pre-saving in ordinary times. This is the least good of the above two items. Because before having children or when children are young, there is no need to worry. However, when children grow up and spend more money, if no preparations were made in the era before having children, nor plans were made after the children were born, then "grasping at straws" is the only way to go.</p>
<p>The method is this: Based on the approximate amount of daily past expenses, and then make a detailed pre-check, and save a certain amount each month from firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, tea, and other expenses, as education expenses. Rather drink less tea, use less oil, play mahjong less, put on less makeup, but this "education fee" for the children must not be less! Each month, "save the extra money in the bank," and when it's time for the children to go to school and pay tuition in the autumn or spring, the parents will no longer have to cry and beg everywhere to "borrow" money.</p>
<h3>The Lonely Life of Modern Women</h3>
<p>— Zhiyun</p>
<p>The London Evening Standard recently published an article by psychologist Mrs. Madi, entitled "Modern Women." She said that among the modern women who discussed psychological problems with her, one was the most striking, because she said, "I am really bored with nothing to do."</p>
<p>Those women who are too busy with things cannot help but laugh when they hear her words. But I have to advise "women who are too busy with things" to pity the women who are "really bored with nothing to do." There used to be a woman who was "bored with nothing to do," who was the wife of a magistrate in a certain provincial city. She said that her idle life made her feel extremely bored, and felt that living like this was too worthless. She felt that living like this was very shameful, but she could not specifically point out what she was dissatisfied with in life. Her marriage was very happy. Her two sons were also very good, both physically and mentally healthy. But in this superior environment, she often felt unhappy, because she felt the loneliness of having nothing to do. Although she had a good relationship with her husband, her husband worked outside all day long. Her only hobby was playing golf, but she was not proficient in it. In the past, her two sons kept her quite busy, but since the sons entered school, she was idle. Housework and socializing only occupied a small part of her time, and she had no other hobbies, so she often looked forward to holidays. Because on holidays, she and her family would go to a small villa in the suburbs for vacation. She grew up in the countryside, so she had a great interest in the garden. Later, she got her husband's consent and simply lived in this suburban villa, and then she regained her interest in life, because she found work in the garden.</p>
<p>In this example, it seems that the occurrence and solution of the problem are very simple, but at present, under this formula, I don’t know how many women are really bored and have nothing to do. This is a phenomenon produced under modern culture, the result of everyone wanting to be modern women. Although they have household work to do, they are not happy to do it, and in some organizations and professional circles, they are deeply closed and refuse their intrusion. So they are wandering around, with nothing to do, but if they can each find their own way according to their natural hobbies, no one needs to worry about not getting a happy life. Before machine production affected living standards, women's lives were limited to the family. But in modern times, the life of a wife or mother has retreated to a part of the entire life. They all want to be women who are happier than their sisters or mothers. They all want to apply the rest of their time to social life that is more valuable than household work, and thus created the ridiculous result of being idle and having nothing to do. Although some people are indeed content with leisure, most of them feel extremely lonely and disappointed, and realize that they are not living, but simply passing the days.</p>
<p>Translator's note, this article is concise and to the point. Although the author is talking to British women, it is no different from a painful criticism of modern women in our country. I believe that there are many modern women in our country who are also "really bored and have nothing to do."</p>
<h3>Common Sense for Pregnant Women</h3>
<p>— Zhenya</p>
<p>Should a pregnant woman temporarily withdraw from society and hide in her room waiting for her little baby to be born? If not, then how should a pregnant woman take care of herself? This is a problem that modern pregnant women and even women who are not yet pregnant are eager to solve. American famous doctor Josephine H. Kenyon recently published the answer to this question in the famous American family magazine Good Housekeeping. Now, according to what I remember, I will introduce the general meaning of the article as follows:</p>
<p>Today, a woman does not need to withdraw from society when she is pregnant. If you are a working woman, you can continue to serve until a few weeks or even a few days before delivery. However, the way to take care of yourself cannot be ignored, otherwise there will be danger.</p>
<p>The first thing to pay attention to is the clothes you wear. Ordinary women often wear tight-fitting clothes for the sake of beauty, but this is not suitable for pregnant women, because it is harmful to the fetus. A pregnant woman must wear loose and suitable clothes, and must pay attention to the size of the abdomen that will expand in the future, so that it will not be hindered.</p>
<p>The second thing to pay attention to is the shoes you wear. Shoes must of course be loose, but especially important is that the toe must not be too pointed, and there must be enough space for the toes to stretch freely. The soles must be flexible, and the heels should not be too high. It is better to wear flat rubber garden shoes if possible.</p>
<p>In addition to clothing and shoes, pregnant women often pay attention to: at least four hours a day must be outdoors, but it is not four hours in a row. You can distribute it throughout the day, for example: one and a half hours outdoors in the morning, one and a half hours outdoors in the afternoon, and one hour outdoors in the evening. Isn't it a total of four hours outdoors in a day? However, the most important thing is not to fix the time you spend outdoors. If you feel tired at any time, you should rest immediately and do not force yourself. If you like gardening life, do not squat down, you must take a small stool to sit on, so as not to press your abdomen and cause danger. When bending down, do not use your abdomen, use your hips.</p>
<p>If you are tired, if you want to rest on the sofa or chair for a while, never forget to put an orange under your feet so that your feet can be stretched straight and flat. If you feel tired when sitting and want to change your posture, then don't worry, just change it often according to your body's needs.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman needs at least nine to ten hours of sleep every night. Even if you don't want to sleep after a meal, you should force yourself to rest for an hour. In your spare time, you can play the piano or draw pictures. In short, you can entertain yourself as you like, but don't use your eyes too much. If you want to avoid eye fatigue, there is also a way, just close your eyes and rest for a few minutes every now and then.</p>
<p>Pregnant women can ride in cars, but they cannot travel long distances, especially bumpy roads. Finally, it should be noted that pregnant women need to rest more, and should be happy all day long, and not accumulate a little melancholy in their hearts.</p>
<h3>Female Newspaper Vendor</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianci</p>
<p>Shanghai is really a world of women. As long as it is a woman, no matter what she does, she is always more advantageous and has a way out than a man.</p>
<p>The section of Luban Road in Lujiawan has always been distributed by male newspaper vendors day and night. Since a female newspaper vendor riding a bicycle, about twenty-one or two years old, came to peddle newspapers, shops and households have flocked to subscribe to her newspapers, and her business has been exceptionally prosperous.</p>
<p>One day, I met her on the road and asked her what she thought of the newspaper vending business. She sincerely replied, "Being a small newspaper vendor like us is a very pitiful thing. We are busy all day long, but we still can't get enough to eat, because we only earn one or two dimes a month for delivering a newspaper. If we can deliver one hundred copies a month, we will only have ten or twenty yuan. Think about how we can make a living and support our families. Speaking of me, although my business is better than other newspaper vendors, it is still very difficult for me. Every morning, I have to go to the newspaper office to pick up the newspapers and deliver them to each household, and it takes about nine or ten o'clock to finish. But my legs are already numb and I can't bear the load. In the afternoon, at four or five o'clock, I have to deliver the evening newspapers, so I am busy all day long. In the autumn, the weather is still mild, so I don't suffer much. But in the winter, it is really unspeakable suffering. Not only can I not stand the whistling northwest wind in the morning, but I also have to ride this wretched bicycle. If I am not careful, there will be danger. In addition, what makes me feel the most painful is the harassment of those customers who touch and move their hands. Although I am a million times unwilling in my heart, I still have to smile. If I don't, I will provoke their anger and break my rice bowl. So I think women are the most pitiful, especially the women who serve in our society!" After she finished speaking, she couldn't help but sob. At the same time, after hearing her words, I also understood a lot about the world.</p>
<h3>Spring Returns to the Earth</h3>
<h3>Contemporary Mulan Notes</h3>
<p>— Chen Cuina</p>
<p>The newspaper of the 21st of last month published a story about a contemporary Mulan, which said: "Last autumn, when the army was marching in Huangling, Ganzhou, because the bandits in front were slightly reduced, the camp was stationed for half a day. I passed by a small market and saw an old man holding a volume of remnant manuscripts in his hand, chanting with great interest. I asked him, and he said: 'A certain camp of the National Army guarded this place some time ago. After the disaster of fire, public and private documents were scattered and incomplete. This is also one of the remnant manuscripts; the inscription says: Collection of Poems and Swords from the Army, which was written by a young military officer, who is actually an incarnation of Mulan, and all his comrades do not know that he is a girl.'" The poem was not written at the end, and the surname was missing, like a dragon without a tail, which the reader doubted. The person is a disciple of the Many Building Poetry, and I know her life experience well. There is a touching story of heroic children in it, but unfortunately it is submerged. Now I will describe it to prove that the old man's words are not false, and also to let people know that there is such a wonderful woman in the world.</p>
<p>The woman's surname is Zhou, and her name is taboo, for fear that it will be inconvenient in the army. She is from Luoyang. When she joined the army, she was eighteen years old, and now she is three years old. She was orphaned and miserable when she was young, and depended on her uncle. The family has a pair of swords, which the woman regards as a good companion. Every time she is sad, she gets up and dances, and the trees in the courtyard all whistle. After the dance, she is filled with emotion and tears. She is betrothed to Mr. Yan in the same village. When the Northeast was陷, Yan organized a volunteer army to go to the national disaster, and there was no news for a long time, or it was reported that he died in battle. The woman was overwhelmed with grief and was ill every day. One day, she suddenly realized and said: It is useless to be sad, and what is the use of dying, and there is no way to repay Mr. Yan. Then she dressed up, cut her hair, and carried her sword to join the army. The sword was engraved with: Poems and Swords. She wrote to me and said: If I cannot kill the enemy to succeed in life, I will kill myself to become benevolent after death. Her tragedy is like this. The woman is intelligent, brave and resolute, and her appearance is graceful and slender like an ancient beauty. She can write poetry, paint, and carve inscriptions. Even in the army, she has never failed to read books for a day.</p>
<p>The woman has no home, only a poem and a pair of swords, which she always carries with her. She once asked me to write on the eyebrow of the poem manuscript, and I signed it as: Collection of Poems and Swords from the Army. The collection includes: Riding iron horses in the night to chase demons in dreams, and blood flowers blooming on the robes in spring. Seeing that I miss her, she said: Last night, the dream of poetry in a small building was far away, and a cold moon sailed into Wusong. I cultivated myself as a disciple of Cui Lou Poetry, and I will never envy plum blossoms in this life. Also, the world is ashamed of fame and fortune. All can be chanted. (I have seen the rest in the News and Women's Semimonthly, so I will not repeat them.) She is sad about the sisters in the Many Building Poetry, and someone pities me for tears. It was written to Miss Jiang Yanan to express her feelings. Now Yanan's recruitment of wood is already done. Since Zhou left last autumn, there has been no news of her. Now I heard that a guest got her collection of poems after the disaster, and I am worried about her. I don't know if this female warrior is safe in the midst of the storm. Alas, she extends her love to the country, and guards the country with arms. She is truly a wonderful woman. It is enough to make cowards hear the wind and make up their minds.</p>
<p>I was so moved by her story that I once wrote a new Song of Everlasting Sorrow. Now I attach it below as a tribute:</p>
<p>The Great Wall is sent to ruin as if it were nothing, and the hatred of moth eyebrows is full of passes and mountains. The tears of Cangwu in 濸湘 for thousands of years, the wind and horse clouds go and never return. Daughters were born in the midst of war, and there is a unique spirit of Youyan in rouge. At the age of fifteen, they sang the songs of pearls and swords, and two lines of tiger armor bent their knives. In the hibiscus small garden, they teased the delicate horses, and their faces were covered with streamers. They shot willows and leaves full of moss steps, and hit orioles out of flower pavilions. Reluctant uncles and aunts pity loneliness and separation, and they have been tied up with girls since they were young. They cherish words and are shy when they are not married every year, and they always blush when people ask them. The pink man is gentle, elegant, brave, and martial. He learns swords, paints, and learns words. A small team of sheep carts selects beautiful jade, and the full building of red sleeves looks at the beautiful son-in-law. Deliberately preventing sisters from knowing, they are doubly reserved when they meet at ordinary times. The only way to show their deep affection is in a back glance. At this time, how can I say that this is a long-lasting hatred? In an instant, the beacon smoke spread the border alert. A man has a will to beg for a long strand, but there is nowhere to ask for a long rope. In addition, they form a volunteer group, and they will not return if they do not kill Lou Lan. They wave flags into clouds and sweat into rain, and the cheers and cries send them off to the sky. Unable to donate their lives to protect their wives and children, they agree with the covenant that you will plan for yourself. They say goodbye to their husbands with tears, and your words are so humble, but your intentions are firm. They promise to live and die and allow confidants. At sunset, the fish is drawn on the city head, and the pipa on horseback urges them to die. They cut off their clothes as a farewell and leave from now on, and the rolling yellow clouds ascend to the general's platform. They swear an oath in white clothes on the edge of the Yi River, and the rouge on the border closes its drum sounds. When the arrows are exhausted and the aid is cut off, they cry out, and those who are wounded are moved and those who fall rise up. They are invincible and their spirit is not peaceful. The sound of killing shakes the sky and the sky is frightened. The Huns are all happy at this time, and Li Guang was originally a scholar. The granary has been raising soldiers for a hundred years in vain, and no one has ever bothered to resist. But seeing the hot blood rushing, the volunteers, crisscrossed bones fill the wormwood, the deep boudoir is sad to the dawn this night, sitting and listening to the thunder gradually flatten, the empty stable escapes back to the masterless horse, the flat sand no longer has the Han family camp. They know that things have changed and emotions have changed, and they look forward to seeing each other after breaking the mirror. Bees shoot through the moon-watching tower, and wolf smoke blackens the flowery circle. Taboo to inquire about the news throughout the Northeast, and do not write poems about mandarin ducks but about swans. Hate stones like fists fill their chests, and a stroke of the Tartar flute cries for thousands of families. Originally, red powder is also heroic, and the ambition is the same from beginning to end. They take off all their hairpins and clouds of hair, and tear through thorns to join the army. Mulan gradually ages in the beacon dust, and after waking up, she sings sadly and smiles in her dream. In her dream, she wields a heroic sword to go down the Great Wall, and she sees Yan 郎 still with a jade face. When the country is broken and the family is destroyed, the grass and trees are new. This heart does not spring again, but it will use the intention of breaking and destroying the phoenix to make people roar like dragons and tigers. Diplomatic relations with neighbors are more important than beacons, and do not ask about the borders but about the rebels. On the stage, they are sad to hear the deer遊, and first sweep away the fox and raccoon house in the grass. The sea flows east for thousands of years of sorrow, and this hatred has turned leisurely for three years. The beauty hugs the golden cup alone in pain, and she cries when she talks about the dangerous city.</p>

<h3>A Tragic Accident Caused by Performing a Circus</h3>
<p>— Luo Caiqing</p>
<p>Liyang Correspondence: A circus troupe came to Liyang to perform during the Lunar New Year holiday. They used the open space across the river in the East Park of the city as the venue and filed a record with the authorities. However, they could not pass without building a bridge across the river, so they hired carpenter Liu Changgao to contract the wood and wages, totaling 40 yuan. After the construction was completed, the construction department inspected it and started business immediately. For several days, the number of people who came to watch was endless. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 a.m. on the 16th, the bridge suddenly broke in the middle due to the thin bridge planks and too many pedestrians. The bridge body also collapsed with it. More than 100 people fell into the water at one time...</p>
<p>I have not been to Liyang, so I have no way of knowing how wide the river separated by the East Park of the city and the open space is. However, according to the correspondence, it only cost 40 yuan to build a wooden bridge, including wood and wages, so the river must not be that wide. Otherwise, it is really suspicious that the technicians of the construction department of the county are all "brainless" if such a shoddy bridge surface can be inspected by the construction department. However, the wooden bridge was still shoddy after all. Isn't it because "the bridge planks were too thin and there were too many pedestrians" that "the bridge broke in the middle with a bang"? However, we cannot completely put the responsibility on the carpenter Liu Changgao. "The bridge planks were too thin" is certainly one of the major causes of the accident, but the minor cause is "too many pedestrians." When the construction department inspected the bridge, perhaps they did not think that the circus troupe had such a big appeal? Let's close our eyes and think about it. "More than 100 people" were crowded on a wooden bridge built for 40 yuan "including labor and materials" (calculated by the number of people who fell into the water, perhaps more than this number). The so-called "endless stream of people watching" is a fact, not a descriptive adjective. Extrapolating in this way, even if "the bridge planks are not thin," it is unlikely that it would not break! The "more than 100 people" who fell into the water are the same as the students who are good at making trouble and "accidentally fall into the water," which is "self-inflicted." Although "making trouble" and "watching a circus" are too inappropriate to compare.</p>
<p>However, those villagers are ultimately not as good as the students with knowledge. Look at the following paragraph of the correspondence: "A few villagers saw this and thought that the origin of the disaster was caused by the circus, and they tore the cloth tent to pieces..." The saying "blame the knife instead of the murderer" is probably the case. But how can you blame the murderer? Therefore, the correspondent finally wrote directly: "It is said that this circus performance in Liyang had a compromise with a certain organization, and the bridge was so flimsy, and no one cared about it, which caused this tragedy. All relevant parties should bear corresponding responsibility." I still copied the title of the news as the title of my article without changing a word: A Tragic Accident Caused by Performing a Circus!</p>
<h3>Brother and Sister</h3>
<p>— Bai Gui</p>
<p>Ping and Li are a very close brother and sister, and they both have considerable jobs. However, every time they meet, Ping always sees that Li's teeth are a bit black and yellow, so he advises her to brush her teeth with good toothpaste.</p>
<p>After a long time, Ping and Li met, and saw that her teeth were still the same as before, so he asked her why she didn't listen to him.</p>
<p>According to Li, she has been brushing her teeth with toothpaste these days, and said that the toothpaste she uses is of the highest quality, because she saw a novel advertisement for this toothpaste in the newspaper. Ping listened to Li's words and said, "Don't believe those novel and flashy words anymore. The effectiveness of toothpaste is to whiten teeth, kill bacteria, strengthen gums, and protect enamel. Only "One Three One Toothpaste" supervised by pharmacists from the Wuzhou Pharmacy has such medicinal effects."</p>
<h3>Record of Saving Life</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>I am writing this text, not to boast of my own merits, but to give others as a lesson:</p>
<p>I have a relative who came to Shanghai to find a job. He found a job, but because of his youth and just entering society, he was unfortunately seduced by prostitutes and contracted gonorrhea! And he was also deceived by that quack doctor, which delayed the treatment period and turned into a lingering chronic disease! When I knew about this and went to see him, he was already in great pain and his life was in danger! At that time, I asked him if he had taken "De Li Ping"? He said that he had not taken it, so I told him to buy it and take it quickly, and said to him, "'De Li Ping's' medicinal power can directly reach the lesion and completely destroy the gonococci. It may save your life at any moment." Later, his disease was really cured, and he was very grateful for my words.</p>
<h3>Snow</h3>
<p>— Falling</p>
<p>The air in the metropolis is already filled with the breath of spring, and newspapers are telling us it's time to "seek plum blossoms." "Seeking plum blossoms" is an elegant affair, but even more elegant should be "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms"; thus, snow comes to mind.</p>
<p>It is said that snowfall before the start of spring is very beneficial for farming because it can kill the eggs of various pests hidden in the soil, so it is called "auspicious snow." But why doesn't spring snow have that power? To be honest, I don't know, or perhaps it's not "timely." In the city, however, there is no distinction between "auspicious snow" and "spring snow." For the poor, as long as it snows, they obediently prepare to "freeze and starve to death"; for the rich, all snow is worth appreciating, without knowing "auspicious snow" or "spring snow."</p>
<p>This year, Shanghai has only had two falls of snow pellets, none of which accumulated, which is a "regretful matter." Nanjing and other places actually have snow accumulation up to a foot deep, although it is "spring snow." However, precisely because it is "spring snow," the number of poets and literati "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms" has increased. According to reports from the Jinghu and Huhu-Yong lines, due to the crowding of passengers during the Spring Festival, three or four ordinary-class special trains will be added as usual to meet the needs.</p>
<p>During this Spring Festival, talking with friends, I also wanted to open the dock and, of course, temporarily impersonate an elegant person by "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms." However, travel requires funds, and "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms" even more requires preparing a large sum to be extorted. So, we just talked about it, and none of my friends left Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have a hanging scroll of "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms" at home, which I hung up during the Spring Festival as a wall decoration, also to enjoy a "reclining tour."</p>
<p>Surrounded by undulating peaks, the plain is a plum forest. An old man, wearing a red hood, rides a weak mule, just crossing a plank bridge. Because the snow on the mountain peak melts, it is diverted into the river, waiting to faintly hear the sound of flowing water. Behind the mule follows a page carrying a qin and holding a paper umbrella, following the hoof prints.</p>
<p>That "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms" is painted very exquisitely, but under my pen, there are only a few strokes, and it is not even one ten-thousandth as wonderful as the painting. For example, the old man seems to be cocking his ear and concentrating, perhaps searching his barren mind to recite a quatrain; and the page, wanting to seek plum blossoms but unable to</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>to leave the master too far, seems to have some hesitant steps.</p>
<p>Whether the elegant people of ancient times sought plum blossoms exactly like in the painting, no one can prove, but it can be guessed that they were a little more elegant than modern people. Modern people like to build those half-Chinese, half-Western villas on the edge of West Lake, which is evidence that they cannot be elegant. When they explore plum blossoms, they must drive a car straight to the end of the road, then change to a rattan sedan, puffing on cigars, and proceed all the way. Being able to support a stick and brave a muddy road for a while is already extremely elegant. On the way back, they all hang budding flower branches on the car or rattan sedan, preparing to bring them back and insert them in vases, while the lover plays the piano, and they sit on the velvet sofa by the stove, staring at the flower branches, also proclaiming themselves as comrades of Lin Hejing, which is a big joke.</p>
<p>Thinking of snow, I then thought of "seeking plum blossoms," unfortunately, the text does not match the theme, and a few hundred words slipped out. But "seeking plum blossoms" cannot be separated from "trampling snow," although "appreciating snow" is another matter.</p>
<p>Recently, a friend returned from beyond the customs (perhaps escaped) and gave me a very grand gift, which is a snow scene near Huangshanzi in Jilin. For those who live in the city and cannot "appreciate snow," it is naturally enough to provide the pleasure of "reclining tour." However, there is no plum forest in Jilin, otherwise, after this modern "trampling snow to seek plum blossoms" picture is reprinted in Shanghai, it could make a good business. Now, simply publish the plate to see the snow scene of our "vast land, abundant resources, and prosperous area." Because even if you prepare travel expenses, I am afraid you still cannot appreciate it, so this can be considered a "reclining tour."</p>
<h3>A Record of Global Air Travel (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Falcouner of the United States, specially translated</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM that afternoon, I flew from Frankfurt to Amsterdam in the Netherlands, a distance of 285 miles, and arrived at 5:15 PM. A representative from the Royal Dutch Airlines was waiting at the airport to greet me. He led me to one of the largest hotels to settle in. In the following two days, he accompanied me to visit the best scenic spots in the Netherlands and to see the world's largest cheese market and the cottage where Emperor Peter the Great of Russia lived when he studied shipbuilding in the Netherlands as a youth. The hotel and other expenses were paid for by the company, and I was given two traveling suitcases as gifts. At 6:00 AM on May 16th, I boarded the company's aircraft, the Wood Pigeon, for a long-distance flight from Amsterdam to Penang, Straits Settlements of the United States. The aircraft was a Douglas model from the United States. In the United States, this type of aircraft usually carries 14 passengers. This time, for the long flight, only eight seats were set up so that passengers would have room to rest and sleep.</p>
<p>We departed at 6:00 AM and arrived at Athens, the capital of Greece, at 5:15 PM, flying 14125 miles. We made short stops in Leipzig, Bratislava, and Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. After spending the night in Athens, we departed again at 6:00 AM the next morning and arrived at Baolian at 6:45 PM, flying 1979 miles. We made short stops in Alexandria, Cairo, and Gaza. We also flew over the Jordan River, Bethlehem (the birthplace of Jesus), the holy land of Jerusalem, and other famous places in the Bible on a clear night. That day, we flew over three continents: Europe, Africa, and Asia, and dined in three of the world's most famous cities. Breakfast was in Athens, the capital of Greece, lunch was in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, and dinner was in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. We stayed at the Riverside Hotel by the Euphrates River. The next day, at 1:45 AM, we got up in a hurry. The bell rang three times, and we soared into the sky again. At 7:15 PM, we arrived at Yottpo. We flew all day that day, covering a total of 1962 miles.</p>
<p>We continued our departure at 5:00 AM the next morning, and at 5:15 PM, we arrived in Yangon, a distance of 1678 miles. We made short stops in Allahabad and Calcutta in India, and flew over the famous Ganges Delta, seeing the river water gushing into the Bay of Bengal through a dense network of outlets. At 5:30 AM the next morning, we departed from Yangon and made a brief stop in Bangkok, the capital of Siam. At 11:00 AM, we arrived at our destination, Penang, having flown 976 miles. Penang is the end point of the Royal Dutch Airlines line. To go further, we had to transfer to an aircraft of the Imperial Airways. Due to waiting for the connecting flight, we stayed in Penang for five days, from May 20th to 25th. Penang was the first place where the British community in the Straits Settlements gathered, and the scenery is excellent, so I felt very pleasant during my five days of residence. At 6:00 AM on May 25th, we departed on the Imperial Airways' Durado airship. I was the only passenger in the ship. After flying 750 miles, we spent the night in Dorlan, French Annam. At 6:00 AM the next morning, we flew to Hong Kong, a distance of 650 miles, and arrived at 11:00 AM on May 26th.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Hong Kong, I learned that I would have to wait at least five months for Pan American Airways to start carrying passengers. (Editor's note: According to a New York dispatch on February 15th, Pan American Airways has announced that the Pacific regular air service from San Francisco to Hong Kong is tentatively scheduled to open on March 24th of this year.) So, I decided to use this time to travel to the Philippines, Japan, and China. I stayed in each place for about seven weeks, feeling that each place had its own unique beauty. I also stayed in Korea, Manchuria, and Rehe for a week. At 2:11 AM on October 31st, near Cavite Port in Manila, I boarded the Hawaiian Clipper flying to Honolulu. There were a total of ten passengers traveling with me, including three women. This was the first commercial flight departing from the Philippines. The moon was bright in the sky at night, and it was lovely. At 4:38 PM, we arrived at Guam Island and stayed overnight at the hotel established by Pan American Airways. Around 9:00 PM, I felt a strong earthquake. The next morning at 5:52 AM, we continued to Wake Island, a distance of 1506 miles. Not long after departure, we received a radio message reporting that Guam Island had been severely damaged by the earthquake.</p>
<h3>Supper</h3>
<p>— Luo Yu</p>
<p>In the middle of those lush, boundless bald mountains, two flat steel rails stretched straight toward the east. On the telegraph wires, buzzing in the spring breeze, gray wild pigeons perched like musical notes, shrinking their small heads and cleverly dodging the gusts.</p>
<p>Ahead were boulders cleared like gums, creating an open path on both sides. In the far distance, blocky little houses like goose-down绒 hid behind the hillside. The stout first section of the railway resembled a slave wearing a red scarf, burdened with a heavy load.</p>
<p>From a small white house nearby walked a hunched figure, waving red and green flags. From that station came the last train of the afternoon.</p>
<p>These were three dilapidated passenger cars, lazily traveling. In those cars sat sparse passengers who looked like workers and small merchants. The workers' faces were full of oil and sweat. Black and shiny hands held the backs of chairs or gripped cigarettes. The rattling windows cast a layer of dim light, refracting the red of the mountains. The sun nestled close to the western mountain peak.</p>
<p>A new worker, still a child, sat on a chair with his head lowered. He stared unblinkingly at the empty lunchbox. His lunch (a dish of pickles, a bucket of rice, and a boiled egg) had been stolen. The faces of his colleagues were unfamiliar, indifferent. The afternoon's work was done with an empty stomach. His nose filled with the smell of oil, and his empty stomach could not suppress the urge to vomit several times.</p>
<p>He tasted this unfair humiliation for the first time. Beneath the half-sunken eye sockets, the buds of resentment grew. The round cheeks drooped, and the lips became unnaturally stubborn.</p>
<p>His stomach rumbled wave after wave. The shaking of the car made him dizzy.</p>
<p>The workers each occupied a chair, legs spread or sprawled on the armrests. The coarse tones of the small merchants at the corners of the chairs matched the rattling of the car. A worker hummed softly a popular tune from Jiaohe Town. Everything collided with unfamiliarity. Everything revealed a bad irony.</p>
<p>As usual, the train stopped at the platform with two rows of whitewashed workshops, briefly imitating a quarrel with a Guan Dong accent. It was all pretense. They gave the oil-smeared people some comfort and earned an equal amount of respect.</p>
<p>The new worker, a teenager in oversized dark blue trousers, staggered. He was very short, moving toward the last tongues of fire of the sun.</p>
<p>He had only run away with his mother this recent autumn. The mother, when she first arrived, hated everything, but soon found her mahjong partners and peacefully made up her mind to live. The father was like a worn-out horse, and every evening, he drank a small pot of shochu.</p>
<p>Jiaohe was a cluster of town houses lying at the foot of the mountain. It was precipitous. The evening wind galloped on the rooftops. They spent a disastrous winter here.</p>
<p>When the short worker walked into that small courtyard, there was a woman, about forty years old, holding a piece of firewood, hitting a child no more than ten years old. The child's head was pitifully large. The child's neck was terribly thin. He cried while uttering rambling nonsense. This scene was common. He felt that the piece of firewood was falling on his own flesh, one blow after another. He clearly felt a surge of humiliation.</p>
<p>"Mom! Let me pour, let me pour." He shouted non-stop, immediately put down the lunchbox, picked up the bucket next to him, and ran out into the street.</p>
<p>The room was dark and dim. A small pit table was placed on the narrow plank kang, with two cold dishes sitting motionless there. A long-faced, middle-aged man wearing a woolen railway uniform sat on the ground by the table, quietly drinking wine. The faint aroma teased the tip of his nose. He did not eat mouthfuls of rice, but pecked at small beans like a waterfowl.</p>
<p>Before long, the big child with the oily black face walked into the room. The mother flicked on a sesame-seed-like light; she was seized by a string of resentful gasps. She then turned to that round face, seeing two crystal tears flowing onto the black urn-like skin.</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Shen Bing</p>
<p>I stood before the half-covered window, my fingers stained yellow by the waning sunlight, and wearily squinted as I looked out. A spiderweb, woven horizontally in the corner of the low wall, suddenly broke and scattered. A black insect hung in the void, swinging as if suspended on a swing. Dust remained silent, in this ancient dusk. The eaves of the roof quietly brushed against the melancholy twilight.</p>
<p>From the rafters to the paving stones below, the twilight spread quietly with the wings of a swallow, landing within the low enclosing wall, quivering slightly like the membranous wings of a dragonfly just perched on a leaf. Thus, in the narrow courtyard, the night air formed a gentle, quiet wave like lake water. The vastness was slightly tinged with blue.</p>
<p>The tired birds hid their heads among their feathers, gripping the branches with one red toe as they stood, seeking rest for the night. Occasionally, a hawk that had come from afar chirped once, drawing a black arc of lightning across the vast sky. But the gentle, quiet wave stagnated and diffused.</p>
<p>Evening clouds lingered in the gloomy sky, drifting and blowing, gradually pressing down toward the corner of the yard. In the courtyard, the neighbor's children picked up their bamboo knives and wooden horses and went home. A young woman carried a kerosene lamp and, using the last rays of the setting sun, added kerosene oil. Her deeply laced waist slowly straightened up again; a rickshaw puller, just returning from outside, was counting the money he had poured out from his waist. A mouthful of sharp-edged laughter flashed across his extremely rugged face. Night was coming.</p>
<p>The twilight blurred the window, and the kerosene lamp could not illuminate it. It was as if someone had pulled curtains over the window.</p>
<p>Like a broken-down wreck, abandoned in the wilderness, the kerosene lamp stank, the water was dry, and I awaited a hint of blue mountains in the black mist. I suspected I was bearing the dusk.</p>

<p>The night is quiet in the West Palace, and the fragrance of hundreds of flowers fills the air. Before the bell and drum towers, the water clock marks the time. Consort Yang is drunk in the Agarwood Pavilion. High lanterns are lit, waiting for the monarch. Eunuch Gao kneels at the palace wall. This servant has something to report to the imperial consort. His Majesty has visited Chaoyang Courtyard and cannot return to the palace wall tonight. The imperial consort hears this and feels dejected. She hastily tells the maids to remove her palace attire. She leans against the dragon bed in her clothes. She sighs and sheds tears. It has been said since ancient times that beauty is often ill-fated. Persuade people not to value the monarch. It is better to marry a romantic hero. To enjoy joy and music from dawn till dusk. Who is there to keep me company alone in the West Palace? Crepe myrtle flowers face crepe myrtle gentleman.</p>
<h3>Storytelling</h3>
<p>Cao Xiaoying "Jade Dragonfly"</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Scholar Lin"</p>
<p>A corner of Lonely Mountain is green on the lake, with three hundred species of plum blossoms forming a forest. What a scholar, Lin Bufu, with a pure and distant mind. He willingly lives in a bamboo fence and thatched cottage, unpolluted by even a trace of worldly affairs. Not only is he fond of learning and never seeks officialdom, but for twenty years his feet have not stepped into the city. Plum blossoms are his wife and his little cranes are his sons. It can be seen that his iron heart and proud bones are innate. In the cold weather, cranes guard the plum blossoms. It seems that Xuan Shi (another name of Lin Bufu) is dutifully serving his mother. Plum blossoms blush. Cranes sing in the shade. One is the smiling face of a goddess from Guye Mountain. The other is the light and pure reading sound of a young phoenix. Occasionally, a distinguished guest visits the mountain temple. His slave boy releases the phoenix into the blue clouds. Only to see them dancing gracefully to welcome the master. The gentleman is returning home in a small boat. He is even better than Tao Qian, who hires a son to wait by the firewood gate. He is skilled in calligraphy and painting and loves to chant poems. He says there is no need for world-famous manuscripts to be preserved. However, the sparse shadows slant across the clear and shallow water. The subtle fragrance floats in the moonlight. These beautiful lines have been passed down to this day. Later, the emperor bestowed silk and grain. He also changed his name to Hejing, calling himself Mr. Hejing. He leaves behind a high and noble name. It is said that Maoling will one day seek his posthumous manuscripts. Fortunately, there were no Fengshan texts. It can be seen that the romantic and unrestrained Sima Xiangru cared little about fame.</p>

<p>Movie</p>
<h3>"Song at Midnight" Premieres Today</h3>
<p>The terrifying blockbuster "Song at Midnight," filled with bewildering mysteries and dazzling wonders, is a rare gem of the film world and the pioneer of domestic horror films. Director Ma Xuweibang's skills are truly outstanding. Because of sufficient technical preparation, the results are exceptionally superior and indescribable. Although the plot is bizarre, it satirizes society everywhere, shakes people's hearts, and reaches a peak. The cast is also extraordinarily impressive. The leading actors, such as Hu Ping, Jin Shan, and Shi Chao, are all famous generals on the silver screen and stage. Jin Shan plays the monster, with terrifying makeup, and his acting skills are also superb. There are three songs in the film, written by the great playwright Tian Han, which are extraordinary. The film premieres today at the Jincheng Theater, and movie fans should be the first to see it.</p>
<h3>Minxin News</h3>
<p>The interior scenes of "New Humanity" have been fully completed in the past few days, and the crew will soon depart for Qingjiangpu to shoot exterior scenes.</p>
<p>"The Gate of Flesh and Spirit" has been completely finished. It was screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater yesterday, and the results were exceptionally brilliant. The play depicts the struggle between spirit and flesh, the conflict between love and hate, the battle between benevolence and violence, and the fight between good and evil. Every inch is tearful, and every foot is bloody. Those who attended the screening praised it as the most magnificent, most sacred, and most beautiful domestic film.</p>
<p>"The Mysterious Female Detective," directed by Ren Pengnian, has already started filming. The female lead is Wu Lizhu, the male lead is Peng Fei, and the villain lead is Wen Rong.</p>
<p>Liang Saizhu, who plays the role of Liu Xiyi in "New Humanity," is not only extremely diligent in her acting but also able to provide the company with various benefits beyond the contract in her work, making Minxin and its collaborators feel satisfied. According to director Bu Wancang, Liang Saizhu's excellent performance has added a lot of color to "New Humanity."</p>
<p>The "New Humanity" special single-volume publication is currently in preparation. Lin Chuchu, Li Keng, Hu Rong, Liang Saizhu, Wang Guilin, Dai Yanwan, Li Junpan, and Xu Kunwu have all accepted the editorial department's invitation to write articles. Some parts have already been submitted, and Bu Wancang's "Words from the Director" is currently being written.</p>
<h3>Cathay Screens "Pennies From Heaven"</h3>
<p>The Unprecedented Work of the King of Song, Bing Crosby</p>
<p>Columbia Pictures can be said to be the maker of stars. Why do we say that? You see, Grace Moore suddenly rose to fame and became famous in the film industry because she starred in the company's "One Night of Love." Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable received awards from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their joint performance in the company's "It Happened One Night." Now, Bing Crosby, the king of song, has achieved great success and further enhanced his reputation for starring in this company's "Pennies From Heaven." This film not only has touching songs with many variations, but the humor and poignancy of the story are also rare. The supporting cast includes the beautiful star Marge Evans and Edith Fellows, the "little bird" in "The Secret of the Secretary," making it a perfect match and impeccable. The film will be released at the Cathay Grand Theater starting today. In order to please the audience, the theater will also specially screen the valuable short film, a Technicolor cartoon, "The Lovelorn Birds."</p>
<h3>"Our Children's Drama Club" Tea Party Cancelled</h3>
