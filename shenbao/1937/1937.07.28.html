<p>時評</p>
<h3>中日局勢是否已臨最後關頭</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>平津旬日來和平沈寂的空氣。至前日又突現緊張狀態。日軍砲轟北平城。飛機轟炸廊房楊村。我方損失甚鉅。並且香月向宋提出最後通牒。在蘆溝橋與八寶山附近之三十七師。限二十七正午退長辛店。在平城內之三十七師。限於二十八日正午。先退永定洞。再退保定。這是甚麼話。這是甚麼理由。</p>
<p>本來早已知道這旬日來所謂和平沈寂的空氣。便是未來大戰的張本。因為約定雙方撤兵。我軍遵約徹退。而日軍不撤。非但不撒。並且天天增兵運械。源源不絕。是彼欲以武力佔領平津的行為。早已昭然若揭。故前日香月向宋哲元提出最後通牒。及飛機轟炸楊村等的慘酷口橫行為。我人早料是必然的結果。</p>
<p>不過我國政府。為息事𡩋人起見。不惜委屈求全。非至最後關頭决不肯輕言自衛。不過最後關頭一語。怎樣關頭。方為最後。殊難明瞭。怎樣為最後關頭。更可作多種的解說。此中神機妙算。當局自有主張。我人原不敢妄測其究竟。我們且靜待到最後的關頭。再領教當局的措施可也。</p>
<p>中日之間。遠者莫論。自九一八之役。繼之以一二八。如冀東的偽組織。機塲之強建築。航空之自由行駛。軍隊則到處演習。飛機則任意飛行。或借兵土失踪為名。任意到處搜索此種絕無理性的舉動。令人刺激太多。刺激太深。無論任何冷靜安閒的頭腦。深覺感受不了。在十分抑制十分忍耐之餘。往往作“𡩋為玉碎。毋為瓦全”的豪語。其內心亦良苦矣。</p>
<p>我國本來是最愛和平的民族。尤其是對外。更主和平。不但現在如此。翻開我國全部歷史。此種和平親善的事實。幾於無代蔑有。但有一語最要關頭。便是能守然後能戰。能戰然後能和。假定一味和平。而不口抗戰。我不知歷史上巳造萬幾許不可洗刷的奇恥大辱矣。</p>
<p>據二十五日天津電。東京方面。口口擴為全面問題。長春天津兩軍部。則主張在當地所得者兌現。前者主張政治手腕。達成目的。後者主張利用大兵壓境機會。追其履行諾言。日本的侵略政策。其技倆袛有兩途。不過在現在日方戰情之下。東京方面的主張。决不會發生效力。現在的局面。無非長春天津兩軍部所表演的一套技倆而已。我不知當局究採何種之手段。以打破此非常的環境。現在的環境是否是最後關頭。我且停筆以觀其後。</p>
<h3>日軍壓迫無己時外部發言人發表談話</h3>

<h3>日本發揮武力對華抱重大决心</h3>
<p>近衛首相說明派兵目的　猶冀中日國交根本調整　華北事件仍求現地解决</p>
<p>［東京］日首相近衛在議會演說、關於對華問題、大要如下、此次華北事變之勃發、誠為遺憾、政府不得已為重大决意、得舉國一致支持、不勝感謝、此次派兵目的、在維持東亞和平如聲明所述、余衷心切望中國政府及國民“自省自律”、從速根本調整國交、（二十七日中央社電）</p>

<h3>廣田宏毅演說外交</h3>
<p>［東京］廣田外相今日在特別議會發表外交演說如下、</p>
<p>夫確保東亞安定勢力之地位、貢獻於眞正世界和平之樹立、乃為日本帝國之國是、今已母待贅言、維當其實行之際、首應考慮中日“滿”穌間之關係、此為余所確信者也、綜觀最近中國之情勢、以統一國內輿論、鼓勵國家意識為手段、而以日本帝國為目標、提倡所謂抗日精神、甚至成為運動、具有組織、強化而利用之、基因於上項情形、於是不祥事態層見疊出、帝國政府認為至堪遺憾者也、帝國政府曾於成都事件勃發之際、卽欲糾正在中日國交日伙本障礙之中國對日態度、關終改善國交與該政府之誠意等等具體問題、求其有所表示、但不幸而該項交涉、因遭華方反對、不得已為之停頓、其後中日兩國關係、直言之、决難認為滿足者也、東亞之日本帝國、其根本方針在乎中日“滿”國間之融和提攜、以阻止赤化勢力之不漸、俾便實現東亞之安定、自母待重申前言、故帝國政府切盼華方對此根本方針、及早得到充分現解與認識、但事實上華方非僅缺乏上項理解與認識、且近來抗日精神變本加厲、甚至本月七日夜間、忽有盧溝橋事件之爆發、要不外乎前因之結果耳、帝國政府對於此次事伴之態度、曾於本月十一日業經聲明在案、當以現地解决與不擴大事態為方針、企圖和平解决、同時並盡力希望南京方面設法善處、迅速收拾時局、此余所以極望華方及早反省、切實履行本月十一日晚雙方妥約現地解决之條件、帝國政府此項態度、已令駐外使臣詳細轉達各國政府、當承充分諒解、惟以南京政府之熊度若何、則對於中國一般民衆之反響、未許樂觀、或不無激發不祥事件之危慮、故屢向華方中央及地方當局對於取締排日行為及保護日僑、促其注意、以應付事態之推移、而策萬全、總之、此次事變、其解决關鍵完全擊於華方之行動若何、余則期待華方容納我方所希望、迅速結束時局、處以適宜有効之措置耳、</p>
<p>對俄解决懸案</p>
<p>至對蘇聯關係、政府自應愼重考慮、惟滿蘇間之邊界方面、依然迭次發生事件、尤以最近蘇聯邊防警備隊非法侵估黑龍江上“滿洲國”領之島嶼、以致日滿部隊與之發生衝突、一時事熊險惡、其後得與蘇聯約定、恢復該方面之現狀、藉此收拾事態日本帝國對於滿蘇國境方面時滋事端之情勢、極為關心欲為防止邊界糾紛計、認有講求實際方法之必要、以處理歷年成為懸案之國界確定、及其糾紛之解决、擬設委員會兩處、企圖緩和邊界方面之空氣、迅速採取適當之辦法、因此、在蘇聯方面亦應虛心坦懷、盡力協助、余認為不得不向蘇聯促其猛省者也、政府對於北洋日商之漁業與北樺太之日商採油掘煤等等利權、自應保障其正當事業之經營、極力加以注意、凡屬根據條約辦理各項事業、决不許其成為有名無實之狀態、總之、日蘇間急付解决之問題尚多、政府自應充分努力，日英關係曾因英皇加冕典禮、日本則以天皇之代表秩父宮與妃參加盛舉、於是兩國傳統的交誼、因此埸加親密、不勝感激、政府歷來對於增進日英親善、未變方針、最近為調整兩國間之關係計、彼此開誠相商、意見已趨一致、自當迅速以圖促進也、</p>
<p>至日美關係近來極其良好、益增親善之度、前次我國經濟使節渡美、與各界開誠交換意見、經濟上及其他各節、兩國接近之處甚非淺鮮、此余引為快慰者也、</p>
<p>運用德日協定</p>
<p>我國曾於客歲與德國訂立日德防共恊定、政府擬將該項協定運用於有効、同時期望將來兩國關係愈臻緊密、</p>
<p>發展對外貿易</p>
<p>至於通商關係則振與輸出、極其重要、亦即我國在生存上必需之條件、尤以現在我國經濟情勢觀之、實為企圖收支適合最重要對策之一端自不待言、惟觀察各國現狀、其於經濟財府及其他各種情形、迄今對於我國輸出貿易尚繼續具有各種障礙、因此、政府應付對方國、分別實情、或與之訂立恊定、或由彼此商家討論、企圖我國輸出貿易之圓滑、幸自今春以來已與印度、緬甸、荷印、土耳其等國、辦安通商交涉、余認為頗堪欣慰者也政府今後仍當努力、維持商權之發展、同時對於原枓資源之自由獲得、及國際通商之自由促進、亦須盡量努力者也、近來國際通商、稍見恢復自由傾之向、誠為可喜之現象也、余對於此項傾向之具體化、在國際上之企圖原來不惜恊力、今則就此加以申明耳云、（二十七日同盟電）</p>

<h3>貢獻話非常時期的工業界</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>我國景近已入非常時代，我國貨工廠各以力量貢獻於國家者，其重要和與敵肉搏的前方將士無異。我們目前所凖備的什麽？我們已否想到萬一全面戰爭開始，我們怎樣服務？怎樣來開始我們的工作，以效忠於國家，我門應做的事太多。</p>
<p>我們第一要集中力量，集中人力物力，關於技術人才的養成，原料品的採集和保存，都是今日必要的工作•凡屬專門人才，如鑛師，技師，化騐師，機械師，工程師，以及工廠中一切工業家，這時應各盡所長，服務祖國，禦侮救亡。各事專門的研究與製造，如軍火軍械之製造，原有機械之改造軍用物品，燃料之節省，食糧之增加，化學之提鍊，以及食糧燃料飼料之替代物，都仗工業家之心血精神，為國服務。歐戰時德國專家之發明食糧飼料與汽油替代物，可為明證。</p>
<p>次如不急要之製造，及與工事無直接關係之工業，應規定產額，减少工作時間，以節省許事燃料，為軍事上之需用。歐戰時美國機器冰糖果石器，磚瓦玻璃各業，减少產量自百分十五至百分之五十，金国貨工廠，在此人難臨頭，各宜先事凖備，以待非常事變之應付。</p>
<h3>國難益趨嚴重聲中國貨界應有的新努力</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>這幾天來，華北局勢，是一天緊張一天，敵人的步步緊逼，得寸進尺，是已使我們全國朝野，到了忍無可忍的地步，特別自從甘日蔣委員長的談話發表，宣示蘆溝橋事伴為我民族堅决犧牲的最後關頭，並昭示政府應戰的决心以後，全國民衆擁護領袖抗敵情緒，是更加益趨濃厚，而我們國貨廠商，臨在這一個民族生死存亡的最後關頭，自然也須更有　積極的凖備，努力新的追切的工作，來迎候這非常時期的到臨！</p>
<p>我們知道，在未來抗戰過程中，前方作戰的能否持久而勝利，果完全縏於後方供應的是否充足，而我民族工業的能與政府有力的後盾，和爭脫一切外力的鎖枷，獲到充分的獨立發展，自然也就在此時，所以在目下，我們是無論為了挽救垂危的民族，或為了開展我民族工業更美滿的前途，我們每一個國貨廠商的從業員，是都應該為這個目標而共同努力，現在我再敢列擧當前我國貨界應加努力的四點，供給大家注意和實行：</p>
<p>第一，我們要加緊努力不賣買私賃運動，與提倡國貨，必要時並呈請政府對敵經濟絕交，因為這直接可以充實我經濟國防，間接也正是足以削弱敵人的資力，增加我抗戰力量。</p>
<p>第二，我們要下毅然的决心，把我們的力量，完全貢獻給國家，我們在戰時要使可能改製軍需用品的國產廠商，都來努力製造各種軍需用品、同時，我們一切製造食糧的工廠，更須加緊生產，以供前後方的急需，共他還應該把一切餘遺下來的廢銅爛鐵供給國用。</p>
<p>第三，我們要立刻集中財力，物力，人力，作非常時期的凖備，譬如，對當前工廠內金融財力的凖備，對原料，物料，燃料的估計，技術人才的羅致等，應有整個的計劃，以期可與敵人長期週旋！</p>
<p>第四，我們要加緊軍事訓練，現在我國貨界的領袖們，都已自動組織特訓隊，我們一般普通職工，當然更加緊軍事訓練，以備未來供國家驅策，共赴國難！</p>
<h3>口頭提倡國貨</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>語云：‘一言可以興邦，一言可以喪邦。’俗語也有說：‘口頭陰鷺，口頭功德。’這就是表明在言語之間，一進一出，關係是很大的。我想對於口頭言語之間提倡國貨，功效也是很大的。</p>
<p>新近市上發現一種白肥皂，廣吿做得厲害，價錢每塊比固本便宜一個銅子•一天，我看見同居某歸人，用那種肥皂正在洗衣服，我便吿訴她，你為什麽不用固本皂呢？貪便宜一個銅子麽？常知道固本皂是我們中國貨，質地純凈，容易去垢，而且不損衣服，這是幾千萬戶人家使用過的經騐談！她聽了我話後，果然改用固本皂，那我的口頭提倡國貨便成功了。前幾天罷，隔壁人家去買汽水，買來一種×方牌，價錢眞便宜，不過六角錢一打。我便同他說：你為甚麽買這牌子呢，這是道地的××貨啊，不如改嗎‘益利’‘屈臣氏’‘老德記’牌子，雖然貴了些，不過這些都是國貨啊!他聽了我話後就改喝國產汽水，那我的口頭提倡國貨又成功丁。鄰居苦蚊，要想去買蚊香，我吿訴他你去買‘三星蚊蟲香。’要想去買汗衫，我吿訴他‘鵝牌’很好。在同事朋友親戚鄰居間，如有購置貨品，他們如有探詢於我，我便把國貨牌子介紹給他們。或正在購買時給我看見，我便指出國貨的牌子請他承買。如見他們已買來非國貨物品，我便吿訴他下次最好改用國貨。夫人之愛國，誰不如我，有的實為了不知道國貨牌子，你若在言語之間介紹他們國貨，實在是很易收效的。</p>
<p>末了說到要實行口頭提倡國貨，那麽先要從你自己慣用了國貨，能對各種應用貨品，道出國貨牌子，歷歷如數家珍，繼可以順便說出在口頭之間，這樣的提倡國貨，便楚‘心口相附’啊！</p>
<h3>洋貨冒允國貨與國貨改充洋貨</h3>
<p>— 郭秀石</p>
<p>在這提倡國貨很熱烈的時際，時常會聽到一般沒有心肝的奸商們，把洋貨來改頭換面，冒充國貨，以欺騙國人，這果然是很痛心一件事！可是，事情是眞正凑巧，事實上正因為還有一般國人的心理，很多還喜歡用洋貨，國貨卽或有同樣的貨物，或竟勝於洋貨，但仍以為非洋貨不用，非洋貨不能信用其可靠。於是，也有少數國貨廠商，為迎合國人心理，便把自己的出品，願與洋商簽訂合同，冠以洋商牌子，給洋行經銷，以充舶來貨品，這也實在可嘆！有一天，筆者在友人沈君處，偶然談起這個事實來，他吿訴我在××路上，有一家國人自己創辦的煤氣油燈廠，他們的出品，完全冠上××洋行的牌子，交××洋行獨家經理銷售於國人。據說：當初創辦時以自己的牌子出售，殊想得到國人的信仰，後來改頂了洋商的牌子，非但貨品依然一祿，銷路則頓形發達了云云。</p>
<p>國貨改充洋貨與洋貨冒充國貨，是同樣的為一般奸商們葬送了天良，喪失了商人的道德，把國貨的地位，深深地埋沒著，把國貨的出路，雙手拱給洋貨來壓迫着，這也許不是偶然的事。所以我特為寫出來，盼望我國貨界及熱心提倡國貨的　讀者注意，不要被這喪心病狂的奸商們來貽害多數眞正國貨的出路才是。</p>
<h3>銷售國貨附加‘國防捐’的我見</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>明白時局趨勢的，誰都知道中華民族的存亡，已這到‘最後關頭’了</p>
<p>抗敵救亡與非常凖備的呼聲！瀰漫全國，且及於海外的華僑，刺激着每一顆大中華國民的心！</p>
<p>非常時凖備的救國方法不一，加緊國貨運動，實行經濟自衛！以援助我軍事自衛，相輔前進！實為打破國難！抗敵救亡的最善方法，使敵人的工業成品，在我國到處碰壁！國貨陣容的嚴整，同於華北于城！處茲非常時期中，余以為國貨市塲於進銷國貨的價格上，抑低利潤，附加百分之五的永久‘國防捐’在發票上，蓋以極醒目而有深意的標戳，或更簡錄蔣委員長昭示之國策，俾顧容們時時警惕！</p>
<p>念茲在茲，而於‘國防捐’之駙加，自樂成之而毫無異言，卜式輸邊，義不容辭。至銷售國貨機關，减低利潤，與顧客們共同凝結，負起救亡的使命和責任，也當然是樂從的事！</p>
<p>‘國防捐’的一點一滴，要收管嚴密，涓滴歸公，貢獻給國家的經濟力量集中，而後衆擎易舉，軍事後援的經濟自衛，益顯功能！無形之戰與有形之戰比，蓋無形之戰，尤勝一籌！‘知恥近乎勇’經濟救亡！國貨救國以此其時矣！</p>
<h3>我的一點貢獻</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>提倡國貨的熱潮，它和民族抗敵情緒的澎漲，成着正比例。換句話說，在今日提倡國貨，並不是狹義的在推廣國貨的銷塲，却是抗敵救亡的一個部門。社會有識之士，對於這一點，是看得淸淸楚楚的。所以，每個人在購買物貨的時候，都有着‘是否國貨’一個觀念。不過，一般不良份子，往往利用我們愛用國貨的熱忱，將劣貨改頭換面，仿造國貨的樣子。最近許朋友吿訴我，他們就上了這樣的當。因爲愛國，抱着‘中國人服用中國貨’的信念，結果却買了冒牌貨，心裏反覺得十分不安。現在，筆者想到一個救濟辦法；除國貨廠商隨時注意冒脾貨品，公吿檢舉外，就是登載聯合‘國貨廣吿’。這國貨廣吿，和以前在報上登的聯合國貨廣吿不同，我的意見是同品名或同性質的貨物，登在一起，今天登載‘火業’，明日登載‘熱水瓶’按日輪流刋佈。這種國貨廣吿，務將貨品商標說明（揭出圖形史好）出產廠家及地點，也要註明。我希望提倡國貨的團體和機聯會應出而倡導；廣吿費旣廉，收效比較普通廣吿為大，各廠商一定很願意這樣做；而購用國貨的人，也不致再被劣貨蒙蔽了。有心人，請嘗試之！</p>
<h3>國貨界的抗敵運動</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>自從蘆溝橋事件發生以來，華北的局勢，便頓呈異常危急的現𧰼。前方忠勇將士，抱着‘寗為玉碎，毋為瓦全’的慷概激昂的態度，誓與敵軍相鬥爭，為國犧牲，誓死抗敵，軍心的奮發，實在是值得全國愛國的同胞們，感得萬分興奮的。</p>
<p>現在全國各界，為了援助前方忠勇衛國將士計，都在紛紛的集議有力的援助辦法，這是很有價值，很有意義的偉大工作。筆者以服務國貨界一份子的資格，也來貢獻幾項簡陋的愚見，希望國貨界有力份子，急起提倡，迅予實行，來凖備應付這個急危的非常時期的到臨。</p>
<p>㊀捐款慰勞　照目前的形勢而論，華北大戰，已將爆發，决非短時期內所可了結，而一切軍需品的購置，在在非有大宗款項不可，各國賃團體，際此時期，應領導各國貨工廠，量力捐助款項，匯送前方，以備各種需要。惟必須注意者，應嚴密組織，使一般寡廉鮮恥之徒，不能假藉名義，利用機會，以圖中飽，致被報章詬誶，涉訟　公庭，失火衆之信仰，長狡猾之風氣，這是應該在事前充分預防的，依筆者愚兄，此事大可由國貨界負有聲譽的團體，出而主持，則成效必著。</p>
<p>㊁努力生產：國貨界全體服務人員，在此緊急關頭，應認淸目標，努力生產，一掃以往消極頹唐的不良習慣，振作精神，加緊工作。例如酒精廠平日出貨二千介侖者，而今而後，應加緊工作，增加生產額，以剩餘之數，儲為國用。其他如棉織業，機器業，化學業等等，也都應該設法加增生產，以備危急時期中的應用。</p>

<p>言談</p>
<h3>奇事種種</h3>
<p>— 靜觀</p>
<p>南京日本領事館的藏本書記，曾經失過一回踪。一失踪，就升了官，變爲副領事，天下於是大亂。這齣戲，大鑼大鼓的開了頭，原是全武行的塲面，結果却用喜剧收了梢。這一回，蘆溝橋事件的起因，也就因為失踪了一個日本兵。宋哲元將軍由天津回到北平，雖然大開城門，誠心誠意，表示對於和平的渴望，也沒有辦法使日軍不進攻，終於又祗好關起城門來。誰知這事情還沒了，上海日本軍營裏的勇士，又缺少了一位。“一二八”的運臺好戲，彷彿又很有重排一回的意思了。</p>
<p>全世界的人都奇怪，“怎麼，日本人又失了踪？”</p>
<p>其實這不希奇，怪的是一個善於失踪的國家，偏踫上了我們這酷愛和平的民族，所以怪事才多了起來。</p>
<p>看看今天（七月廿七）的報上，日軍已經向北平開砲了。事先，據說曾有大井村的日軍五百餘名，分乘載重汽車四十餘輛，集中廣安門外財神廟北；共中的一百五十名，還在廿六日下午七時半，呌開廣平門，浩浩蕩蕩的進了城。一進城，就在汽車裏乒乒乓乓的開了槍。雖然趕快關起來，外面的大砲接着就轟進來了。</p>
<p>還有更奇怪的，是說日軍畏我如虎——“。……據來滬之西人言……二十九軍作戰之勇，令人起敬。………在蘆溝橋激戰時，有兩次華兵如衝鋒過去，可以一面得到通州，一面得到豐台……日軍畏廿九軍如虎，出戰時多臨陣脫逃，一（見七月二十六日大晚報）</p>
<p>旣然“日畏我軍如虎，”爲什麽報上又老是載着日軍向我進攻的消息呢？</p>
<p>人家啟釁而反向我們抗議，這些事情，是怎麽想也想不通的。</p>

<h3>對於目前救亡工作之供獻</h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>㊀當前時局之認識</p>
<p>㊀盧溝橋事件爆發，是敵人對中國大規模新進攻的開始。華北的危機迫在眉睫。非立卽抗戰不足以保北平，更不足以保垂危的華北。此次抗戰，將是中國整個民族一百餘年來從奴隸役辱下解放的起點。中國必得到最後的勝利，而日本帝國主義必然從我們領士上驅逐出去。</p>
<p>㊁蔣委員長宣言：“盧溝橋事變的推演，是關係中國國家整個的問題，此事能否結束，就是最後關頭的境界”。這是我國最高當局對目前局勢最明確而毫不猶疑的認誡與表示。又說：“全國國民最要認清所謂最後關頭的意義，最後關頭一到，我們只有犧牲到底，抗戰到底，唯有犧牲到底的决心，才能博得最後的勝利，若是彷徨不定，妄想茍安，便會陷民族於萬刦不復之地”。又說：“至於戰端旣開之後，則因為我們是弱國，再沒有妥恊的機會，如果放棄尺寸土地與主權，便是中華民族的千古罪人，那時候便祇有指民族的生命，求我們最後的勝利”。這是我國最高當局對於目前局勢對我全體國民的堅决表示與訓誡。全體民衆，應以最大的熱誠，擁護蔣委員長這一堅决而明確的宣言。全國民衆，應以最大的信心寄於蔣委員長，認定蔣委員長必能本其偉大人格與為國之赤誠，而把所說的成為我國堅定不移的國策。我們今日起而號召救亡，就將完全以蔣委員長這一宣言為我們行動的指針。我們今日已能確切認定的，就是：現在已到“最後犧牲關頭”，“全民唯有拼一戰以求最後之勝利”！</p>
<p>㊂對外抗戰，應在統一指揮之下進行。任何不同的意見與派別，應在對外作戰犧牲到底的决心之下統一團結起來。全國軍隊，於戰略上應放在整個作戰策略指揮之下。民衆救亡工作，應受政府之領導。今日每一個熱誠獻身救亡工作者，應堅决地自誓：必須在熱誠擁護政府對外抗戰策略之下開展其行動。民衆與政府間，絕對不應再有一絲一毫的對立存在。政府應領導民衆，組織民衆，民衆應信任政府必能對外强硬到底，要以民衆的熱烈擁譏，更加强政府對外决戰的决心。</p>
<p>㊁目前我們應做的工作</p>
<p>A·對政府的要求</p>
<p>㊀中日交涉，應放在中央政府之下來解决，反對藉口地方事件的任何解决。此次盧橋事件，責任全在日方，如有交涉，應自日軍自動撤退始，然他們連日砲擊宛平城，絕無和平誠意可知。</p>
<p>㊁立調大軍北上，增援二十九軍，决不退出盧橋一步，所有察北察綏陝甘軍隊，一致向北平集中，必要時卽展開全面戰綫。</p>
<p>㊂民衆救亡團體，行動，救亡言論（賒關軍事秘密外），應盡量開放，一切擁護政府對外抗戰民衆的言行，應予保護與領導。我們知道，民衆的力量，才是政府最有力的後盾，中國對外抗戰，主力决不在單純的軍事力量上，全民衆的憤怒與决心，取得最後勝利的唯一條件。故不决心對外抗戰则已，否则，政府只有從民衆團結擁護中央，它才能與敌人誓死作戰到底。這是一切殖民地半殖民地民族解放戰爭的特點，也是它的優點。</p>
<p>B·前綫與後方</p>
<p>現在，二十九軍對外抗戰，已經形成，為使這抗戰堅持，擴大，在前綫與後方，我們應有許多工作立卽要做的：</p>
<p>㊀組織慰勞隊二十九軍浴血艱苦抗戰，後方民衆，已於精神上物質上不斷予以鼓勵，但還有一種工作可做，卽各地組織慰勞隊，前赴火線直接給我軍以慰安與鼓勵。此次慰勞隊，工作可分多項，如救護隊，可組織在內，卽在戰區中會務：歌詠隊，鼓勵軍士精紳，慰勞品之輸送等。</p>
<p>㊁展開更廣大的募捐運動，呈獻政府與前綫將士</p>
<p>㊂組織宣傳隊赴附近鄉村宣傳此次敵人進攻之危機與政府抗戰之决心。演抗日戲劇，傳播救亡歌曲。</p>
<p>㊃徵集救護隊大戰爆發，傷亡必多，救護工作，應從速準備，防空防毒常識，也須趕速訓練，應速徵集救護隊，號召廣大市民加入。</p>
<p>㊄徵集義勇隊抗戰開始，作戰主力，不能全靠正式軍隊，民衆都有人人上火綫必要與義務，此時應開始準備，徵集廣大市民參加義勇隊，現在政府舉辦之公民訓練，可以為義勇隊之基幹，瞧卽開始徵集，以俾必要時卽可出動。</p>
<p>就所想到的略舉如上，其他工作甚多，可各方面進行，但有一個中心：努力促進抗戰之實現，擁護政府强硬對外，一切工作，應從此中心而為有機的運用。</p>
<p>㊂具體的進行</p>
<p>㊀商界，學生，工人，自由職業者，同鄉會，一切團體，應自動參加一個總團體，就自己最適合之工作，從事救亡。商界團結商人，學生組織學生。範圍不必求大，有三四人發起號召卽可，俟各小團體成立後可就其質性合為大的組織。</p>
<p>㊁一切行動，應在最公開而熱誠擁護政府前提下舉行，應請當局之指導，應盡量做消失外界無謂誤會之工作，單純只為救國，反對一一激烈之軌外行動</p>
<p>㊂現在已成立之抗敵後援會，應儘量吸引一切愛國份子團集於組織之中。</p>

<h3>Song Officially Responds to Japanese Ultimatum, Firmly Rejecting Unreasonable Demands</h3>
<p>Beijing Situation Enters Most Critical Period; Intense Fighting Erupts Successively in the Suburbs of Beijing; Japanese Army's Targets are Nanyuan and Xiyuan</p>
<p>[Beijing] On the 26th, the Japanese Garrison Army issued a final ultimatum demanding that the 37th Division stationed at Lugou Bridge and other locations withdraw by noon on the 27th. Because we decided on our final stance, we notified the Japanese side to delay the response by three hours. Subsequently, at 3 PM on the 27th, we officially responded, rejecting the unreasonable demands of the Japanese Garrison Army. Consequently, all negotiations came to a standstill. The sounds of gunfire and artillery can now be heard intermittently in the suburbs of Beijing. The fiercest fighting is occurring in the southern suburbs around Nanyuan and Tuanhe, and it has not stopped as of the time of this dispatch. It is reported that our army is fighting valiantly, with many casualties. They are still engaged in fierce combat in Tuanhe. In the eastern suburbs, there have been clashes with our troops stationed at Baozhusi, near the border with Tongxian. The situation in the afternoon is not yet clear. In the western suburbs, sporadic shooting occurs around Babao Mountain and Weimenkou, but the fighting does not seem very intense. In the northern suburbs, Japanese plainclothes units and cavalry frequently appear in areas such as Gaoliying, Xiaotangshan, and Lishuiqiao. Our side is maintaining strict vigilance. As for the Lugou Bridge area, there have been no reports of contact here. Based on observations of various situations, the Japanese army intends to encircle Beijing, thereby pressuring China to achieve its objective of winning without a fight. Their primary targets are Nanyuan and Xiyuan. The Japanese Garrison Army originally stipulated that the 37th Division troops stationed in Beijing city should withdraw before noon on the 28th, but it is reported that when we replied at 3 PM on the 27th, we rejected this request altogether. Therefore, the situation here has entered its most critical period, and it is generally expected that a major war is imminent. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] On the 27th, the situation in North China shifted from extreme tension to a state of suppressed anxiety. The Tianjin authorities are not engaging in discussions with the Japanese military. Although the center of negotiations is in Beijing, contact has been lost due to disrupted communications, and news is scarce. It is generally believed that noon on the 28th is the final key moment, and the situation will unfold. According to European and American observers, Sino-Japanese peace is not entirely hopeless, and a reversal may occur on the morning of the 28th, changing the situation. At 4 PM on the 27th, the Japanese military hosted foreign reporters, announcing that the final deadline was noon tomorrow. The spokesperson subsequently stated that they could not be held responsible for the news. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Beijing] Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, our central and local authorities have maintained calm and sought peace, while the Japanese side has been continuously increasing its troops in large numbers. On the one hand, they have been engaging in sham negotiations for peace as a delaying tactic, while on the other hand, they have been provoking incidents and making unreasonable demands everywhere. After shelling Wanping on the 20th, followed by bombing Langfang, on the 26th, Kagetuki once again made various unreasonable demands to our authorities and attempted to break through Guang'anmen and seize Beijing. In Tianjin, they occupied the stations along both the Beining and Jinpu Railways, causing the situation to become increasingly serious. Our authorities, considering the Japanese military to be unreasonable and intentionally provocative, believe that the situation has reached a final juncture and that peace is almost hopeless. Starting from the 27th, they decided to reject all unreasonable demands and prepare to fight for the survival of the nation and the people. The people of Beijing are exceptionally invigorated, with a calm demeanor, and determined to unanimously support our government. Although city traffic was normal on the afternoon of the 27th, intense fighting had already begun successively in the suburbs. Japanese aircraft have been soaring in the sky all day, engaging in reconnaissance. A major war is feared to break out tonight or tomorrow morning. Our authorities have thorough plans for maintaining public order in the city, protecting foreigners, and guiding residents in preparations for wartime. The entire city is united and excited, vowing to fight the strong enemy to the end. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Beijing] All communication lines to Beijing, except for the one to Tianjin, have been cut. Telephone communications have also been completely disrupted. Beijing has once again imposed martial law throughout the city. There was fighting outside the western city's railway station last night. It is said that the Japanese army attempted to occupy the station but was repelled by the Chinese army. Reports of fighting on the Wanping front line last night are inaccurate; there were only sporadic gunshots. The negotiations between Matsui and Zhang Zizhong in Beijing yesterday regarding the Langfang case made no progress. The Japanese army in Langfang has received reinforcements from Tianjin, now totaling over two thousand men. The Chinese authorities refused to release the contents of Song Zheyuan's telegram to Nanjing. However, it is the understanding in political circles that Song was merely seeking instructions. The Chinese community believes that the Japanese side is firmly demanding that Chinese troops withdraw from Huangcun, intending to completely control the Pingjin Railway. Judging from the current situation, the Japanese army seems to be employing the same old trick as after the September 18th Incident, gradually occupying North China until seizing it all. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The attitude of the 37th Division towards the Japanese ultimatum is unknown to the Chinese authorities here because telegram and telephone lines between Beijing and Tianjin are cut. However, everyone views the overall situation as hopeless. This morning, another thirty Japanese aircraft arrived in Tianjin, causing alarm. Yesterday's fighting in Langfang was something the Chinese authorities tried to resolve locally. However, all subsequent negotiations have been suspended. The Chinese side believes it is particularly difficult to discuss the Japanese proposals because Japanese reinforcements are arriving continuously. The Security Corps is currently maintaining order in the Chinese areas here. Chinese troops around the Chinese areas are on high alert. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Beijing] Matsui delivered a final ultimatum to our authorities yesterday, demanding that Feng Zhi'an and Zhao Dengyu's troops within Beijing city withdraw by noon on the 27th, or the Japanese side would take decisive action. (Urgent dispatch, 2 PM, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Tongxian Shells and Bombs Us</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] At 6 AM on the 27th, the Japanese Hiroshima unit and the Jidong Security Corps surrounded a battalion of the 29th Army stationed outside the south gate of Tongxian, and a fierce conflict erupted between the two sides. Five Japanese aircraft dropped a large number of bombs. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Beijing] Two battalions of the 29th Army stationed outside Tongxian city were surrounded by the Japanese army at 7 AM this morning, intending to disarm our troops. Our troops refused, and the Japanese army immediately attacked with artillery and machine guns. The sound of artillery fire was very clear and detailed in Beijing. It had not stopped as of 10:30 AM. (Urgent dispatch, 2 PM, 27th)</p>
<p>[Beijing] According to reliable sources, at 2 AM on the 27th, the Japanese army in Tongzhou suddenly notified a certain unit of our army stationed at Baozhusi in Tongxian, with the intention of forcibly disarming them. Our army refused, and the conflict began at 3:30 AM, and fighting continued until approximately 6 AM. According to another report, southwest of Tongxian city, the Jidong puppet Security Corps commander is supervising over a thousand laborers to construct fortifications, extending approximately six or seven li from Chongyu and Si through Hongguoyuan to the main line of the east and west Zongtun, directly facing our army's stationed location. Enemy artillery on the walls of Tongxian is scattering fire at our stationed troops. The shelling had not stopped as of 11 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>[Beijing] A conflict erupted in Tuanhe, south of Nanyuan, at 4 PM on the 27th. Our troops under Zhao Dengyu stationed there are fighting hard. It had not stopped as of the time of this dispatch. Also, at 1 PM on the 27th, a Japanese aircraft flew over Nanyuan, circling and conducting reconnaissance for a long time.

They were still facing each other in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Beijing] The situation at Lugou Bridge suddenly became tense on the 27th. Approximately eight or nine hundred Japanese soldiers arrived from Fengtai in the areas of Da'i Village, Wulidian, and the east and north of Lugou Bridge on the morning of the 27th, constantly opening fire and provoking our positions. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Beijing] In Tuanhe Village, south of Nanyuan (ten li from Nanyuan), approximately one thousand Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived at 2 PM on the 27th, carrying steel cannons and machine guns, advancing from the Yangcun area and suddenly attacking our local garrison troops. Our troops immediately rose up and resisted. The Japanese army concentrated artillery fire, fiercely attacking our troops, who also fought bravely. By approximately 3 PM, the Japanese soldiers retreated slightly, dividing their forces into several small units, hiding in the cornfields. At 4 PM, the Japanese artillery resumed shelling us with cannons and machine guns. Our troops still calmly resisted, without the slightest hesitation. The clear sound of gunfire and artillery could be heard in the southern city area. At 4:10 PM, a Japanese bomber flew in from the east, circling and conducting reconnaissance over Nanyuan and Tuanhe for approximately fifty minutes before returning east. At 5:10 PM, a Japanese bomber was still circling Nanyuan and Tuanhe for half an hour before returning east. Both aircraft were carrying bombs but did not drop them. As of 7 PM, the fighting in that area had not stopped. The Nanyuan area is calm, and our troops are on alert. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Provoke Again at Guang'anmen Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Beijing] After clashing with our troops outside Guang'anmen on the evening of the 26th, at approximately 1 AM on the morning of the 27th, over four hundred additional Japanese soldiers from Qitai, nine tanks, five armored vehicles, and over ten heavy trucks arrived outside Guang'anmen, joining with the two hundred or so Japanese soldiers originally stationed outside the city, and did not leave until late at night. At 2 PM on the 27th, they suddenly opened fire, shooting at our troops. Our troops are calmly holding their ground. The firing stopped at 3 PM. At that time, a temporary curfew was declared from Dajie to Caishikou within Guang'anmen, cutting off pedestrian traffic, which was restored to normal at approximately 3 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Beijing] In last night's battle at Guang'anmen, one of our soldiers died, one was seriously injured, and ten were slightly injured. Approximately thirty Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded within the city. (Urgent dispatch, 2 PM, 27th)</p>
<h3>Beijing Enters a State on the Eve of a Major War</h3>
<p>[Beijing] Beijing gradually entered a state on the eve of a major war on the evening of the 27th. After 8 PM, trams gradually stopped running, and pedestrians on the streets gradually decreased. Northeast Chang'an Street, east and west of the single archway, which used to be bustling streets, are now quiet and solemn. Only the dim green streetlights cast shadows on the trees along the road, creating an even more austere atmosphere. The city gates were tightly closed all day, leaving only Qianmen open for passage. Sandbags and obstacles were piled up at key intersections. The station doors of the east and west railway stations were tightly closed, and no one was present. After the official announcement of rejecting any unreasonable demands from the Japanese side, the people's hearts were stirred, and they all wanted to know what exactly was happening. As a result, sales of evening newspapers soared, with everyone holding a copy and reading carefully, with expressions of joy mixed with sadness on their faces. Because many of the telegraph lines outside the suburbs were cut by the Japanese army, telegraph and telephone communications were disrupted, so wired telegrams encountered obstacles. Telephones to Baoding, Tianjin, and Tongzhou from Beijing have not been restored. Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Chen Jiyan, and others discussed the security of Beijing city on the morning of the 27th, making detailed decisions on the protection of foreigners. However, many foreigners have already received orders from their embassies to gather together. It is reported that the embassies of various countries in the Dongjiaominxiang have already allocated responsibilities for maintaining security in the area. The west entrance of the lane is guarded by American soldiers, while Japanese soldiers are responsible for guarding Taijichang. Japanese residents within the city were concentrated in four locations on the afternoon of the 27th: the Japanese Club, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Japanese Embassy, and the Japanese elementary school. The Japanese news agency, Domei News Agency, stopped sending dispatches on the 27th, and Japanese staff members have all fled. Guang'anmen Dajie was under temporary curfew at one point on the afternoon of the 27th and then lifted. It is said that among the Japanese soldiers who entered the city on the evening of the 26th, some were plainclothes soldiers mixed in. Later, the armed soldiers were returned to the Japanese barracks, and the plainclothes soldiers resurfaced from Niujie and other places on the 27th, but in very small numbers, so order was quickly restored. Not many citizens evacuated, but everyone had a tense expression on their faces. The soldiers distributed on the streets were especially spirited and indignant. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Beijing Gather at Embassy</h3>
<p>[Beijing] On the 27th, the Japanese Embassy ordered Japanese residents in Beijing to gather at the embassy immediately. The German Embassy also ordered German residents to move into the embassy if necessary. In response to a request from British residents, the British Embassy has agreed that residents can move into the embassy at any time. The embassies of the United States, France, and Germany have not yet taken action. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Beijing] All Japanese residents in Beijing were ordered to enter the Japanese Embassy and other designated assembly points in Dongjiaominxiang before noon today. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy claimed that this measure was to prevent a violent reaction from the 37th Division to the Japanese ultimatum. Japanese soldiers who were trapped in a temple within the city last night were escorted to the Beijing barracks this morning after joint consultations by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. Japanese soldiers outside the city are withdrawing to Fengtai. According to the Japanese authorities, four Japanese soldiers died and seven were injured in the Langfang battle. Japanese aircraft flew incessantly in the Beijing sky this morning, and the rest of the city remained peaceful. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Concession in a State of War</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] After preparing overnight, the Japanese Concession was in a state of war this morning. Sandbags were piled up along the streets bordering the Chinese areas, and barbed wire defenses were built and guarded by soldiers. The riverside of the Japanese Concession was sealed off by troops, ferries were suspended, and iron gates were closed. This morning, automobile and rickshaw traffic was prohibited on the streets. Only Japanese military vehicles and trams were allowed to operate, and pedestrians and tram passengers were inspected. Chinese police in the Japanese Concession were not carrying firearms. The area between the East Railway Station and the International Bridge was patrolled by Japanese soldiers. After the Langfang battle, the Beicang and Yangcun stations were occupied by Japanese soldiers. The Chinese Security Corps defended overnight, restricting Japanese armored vehicles from entering. Japanese armored vehicles drove along the roads of the Chinese area. This morning, the Security Corps issued hand grenades and additional ammunition to its members. The Japanese authorities are currently trying to send all Japanese residents to Dongjiaominxiang. The Japanese Embassy, Japanese Bank, and Japanese Police Bureau have already accommodated one-third of the Japanese residents. Korean residents gathered in the former Austrian Concession. Last night, a bomb exploded in a Japanese residential area, injuring eight Chinese. According to Chinese sources, the bomb accidentally fell from a Japanese military vehicle transporting munitions. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese Concession remained under strict guard on the 27th. Pedestrians were allowed to pass only from 8 AM, and only on Asahi Street, Sakae Street, and Akashi Street. Other intersections were closed. Japanese police and gendarmerie were extremely strict in inspecting pedestrians. From the afternoon of the 26th to the evening of the 27th, a total of over fifty Chinese were arrested. Japanese soldiers at the East Railway Station also increased, and military transport vehicles were constantly coming and going, preventing Chinese from entering. The situation was tense. Japanese soldiers at the main station also increased. The Japanese army still occupied the West Railway Station. Many rumors were circulating in Tianjin, and there was a constant stream of people relocating. The municipal authorities have made extraordinary preparations. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese Concession in Tianjin has been under very strict guard since the 27th. Currently, only Asahi Street, Akashi Street, and Sakae Street are passable, but whether traveling by vehicle or on foot, one must be inspected. Even trams must be inspected before they can pass. In addition, sandbags and electric wire fences have been set up at various intersections, guarded by Japanese soldiers. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Determined Not to Accept Unreasonable Demands</h3>
<p>[Beijing] Reliable sources confirm that while both Chinese and Japanese sides have been attempting to prevent the Lugou Bridge Incident from escalating and hoping for a peaceful resolution, on the night of the 25th, the Japanese suddenly advanced troops towards Langfang again, firing on our garrison. On the morning of the 26th, they even increased large numbers of reinforcements and used seventeen bombers to bomb everywhere. Our troops fought bravely, suffering heavy losses. On the night of the 26th, the majority of Japanese troops even rushed into Guang'anmen, but fortunately they were prevented and stopped by our defenses and retreated into the Japanese barracks. Our authorities have now decided not to accept any unreasonable demands. It is hoped that all citizens of the city will remain calm and composed and face the national crisis together. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>All Negotiations Have Come to a Standstill</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] The situation has reached a final juncture. All negotiations here have ceased. Because telephone and telegraph communications between Beijing and Tianjin have been disrupted, the transmission of news is slow and uncertain, so it is impossible to know how far the overall situation has developed. Zhang Zizhong is in Beijing, and municipal affairs are handled by the Municipal Government Secretary-General Ma Biaochong and the Police Chief Li Wentian, and others. According to the authorities, Dagu and other places are currently calm. There was no conflict in Langfang on the morning of the 27th. Chinese and Japanese troops are still facing each other.

(Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>The Course of Two Conflicts in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Following the conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops inside Guang'anmen on the evening of the 26th, Guang'anmen Street was deserted on the 27th, with most shops remaining closed until noon. The city gate was heavily fortified with sandbags. According to a soldier guarding the gate, on the evening of the 26th, over a hundred Japanese soldiers, in more than ten large trucks, entered the city with permission from our authorities. About sixty or seventy soldiers quickly dismounted the vehicles and dispersed, opening fire on our troops with machine guns. Our troops immediately returned fire, launching several hand grenades. Due to the large number of Japanese troops outside the city, we quickly closed the city gate. Guang'anmen Street was transformed into a battlefield, resulting in a fierce street battle. Upon hearing the gunfire, Japanese troops outside the city fired several artillery rounds into the city, subsequently clashing with our garrison stationed outside the city. Simultaneously, ten Japanese plainclothes soldiers emerged from an unknown location and also opened fire on our troops. The entire company of soldiers guarding the gate fought bravely. The intense battle lasted until around 9 p.m., when the Japanese troops, unable to withstand the resistance, retreated towards Niujie. They were then surrounded by our troops, and the gunfire ceased. The conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops outside the city also gradually subsided. Around midnight, after negotiations between both sides, the surrounded Japanese soldiers were escorted back to their barracks. In this battle, the Japanese suffered approximately thirty casualties, while our side had one soldier killed, eleven wounded, and one patrol officer killed. It is evident that the Japanese action was a coordinated effort from within and without, a planned operation to break through Guang'anmen, allowing a large number of Japanese troops outside the city to enter. Therefore, we pledge to fight them to the death. His words were filled with grief and indignation. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] A battle occurred outside Zhangyimen in the western city last night. It is reported that twenty Japanese soldiers were killed inside and outside the city. Three trucks, fully loaded with soldiers, were destroyed by hand grenades. On the Chinese side, one policeman was killed and another wounded. Initially, three hundred guards from the Japanese embassy arrived at Zhangyimen from Wanping. When trucks loaded with Japanese soldiers passed through the city gate, the battle erupted. The Japanese soldiers then dispersed and hid in various houses inside and outside the city, engaging in combat with Chinese soldiers using rifles and machine guns. The Chinese soldiers responded with mortars. Most of the Japanese soldiers took refuge in a temple inside the city and were surrounded by approximately one thousand Chinese soldiers and plainclothes civilians. At that time, a dense network of sentry lines was established around Zhangyimen. The battle lasted for four hours before ending. Reuters received a phone call from Fengtai stating that Japanese tanks were currently heading towards Pingcheng, but the phone line was cut off before the conversation could be completed. According to eyewitnesses, after the battle broke out, the inner and outer city gates of Zhangyimen were immediately closed, creating a very dangerous situation.

<h3>Intermittent Telecommunications Between Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] After the Langfang conflict ceased, the authorities originally planned to run a trial train at 6 a.m. on the 27th to inspect the route and plan for resuming traffic. However, due to congested Japanese military vehicles, the train did not depart from Tianjin until 2:40 p.m. Personnel from the Railway Bureau's engineering, defense, and telecommunications departments, along with Japanese liaisons, accompanied the train. They arrived at the Langfang area at 5 p.m. and repaired the telephone lines. Communication was restored by 6:30 p.m., and the train returned at 9 p.m. The Beijing-Ningbo Railway's telephone lines between Beiping and Tianjin were also connected on the afternoon of the 27th, but they were intermittently disrupted by Japanese troops along the line. Passenger trains between Beiping and Tianjin were completely suspended, and there was no hope of resuming traffic on the 28th. The Beijing-Pukou train, starting from the 27th, used the West Station as its departure point, bypassing the main station. The Dagu workshop of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was still occupied by Japanese troops yesterday. (Special dispatch from the 27th)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] After the Japanese army's attack on Langfang, Chairman Song ordered a counterattack because the Japanese army showed no sincerity for peace. Both sides suffered many casualties. The Japanese army then brazenly issued a so-called ultimatum, demanding that our army withdraw to Changxindian before noon on the 27th. According to sources in Nanjing, Song Zheyuan decided to reject it. As of 5 p.m. on the 27th, there were occasional conflicts between the two armies in the suburbs of Beiping.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Has the Sino-Japanese Situation Reached a Final Turning Point?</h3>
<p>—Blowing</p>
<p>The peaceful and silent atmosphere in Beiping and Tianjin for the past ten days suddenly turned tense again the day before yesterday. Japanese troops shelled the city of Beiping and bombed Langfang and Yangcun. Our side suffered heavy losses. Moreover, Xiangyue presented Song with a final ultimatum, demanding that the 37th Division near Lugouqiao and Babaoshan withdraw to Changxindian by noon on the 27th and that the 37th Division inside the city of Beiping withdraw to Yongdingdong by noon on the 28th, then to Baoding. What is this? What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>It was already known that the so-called peaceful and silent atmosphere of the past ten days was the prelude to a future war. Because it was agreed that both sides would withdraw their troops, our army complied and withdrew, while the Japanese army did not withdraw. Not only did they not withdraw, but they also continuously increased their troops and transported weapons, endlessly. Their intention to occupy Beiping and Tianjin by force was already obvious. Therefore, the day before yesterday, Xiangyue presented Song Zheyuan with a final ultimatum and the brutal and unreasonable acts of bombing Yangcun and other places were a predictable outcome.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of calming things down, our government has spared no effort to compromise and will never lightly resort to self-defense until the final moment. However, the phrase "final moment" is difficult to understand. What kind of moment is considered final? There can be multiple interpretations of what constitutes a final moment. The authorities have their own ideas about this, and we dare not speculate on the details. Let us wait quietly for the final moment and then learn from the authorities' measures.</p>
<p>Between China and Japan, let us not mention the distant past, but since the September 18th Incident, followed by the January 28th Incident, such as the puppet organization in eastern Hebei, the forced construction of airfields, the free movement of aviation, and the constant exercises of troops everywhere, the arbitrary flying of planes, or the arbitrary searches under the pretext of missing soldiers. These unreasonable actions are too stimulating and too profound. No matter how calm and leisurely the mind, it feels unable to bear it. After much restraint and patience, people often make grand statements like "It is better to be a shattered piece of jade than a whole tile." Their hearts are also filled with pain.</p>
<p>Our country has always been the most peace-loving nation, especially towards foreign countries. We advocate peace. This is not only the case now, but throughout our country's history, these facts of peace and friendship have existed in almost every dynasty. But one sentence is most important: We must be able to defend before we can fight, and we must be able to fight before we can make peace. Assuming we only advocate peace and do not resist, I do not know how many unerasable great shames and insults have been created in history.</p>
<p>According to a Tianjin dispatch on the 25th, Tokyo is expanding the issue into a full-scale problem. The military headquarters in Changchun and Tianjin advocate realizing the gains made locally. The former advocates political tactics to achieve the goal, while the latter advocates using the opportunity of overwhelming military presence to pursue the fulfillment of promises. The Japanese aggressive policy has only two tricks. However, under the current battle situation of the Japanese side, the proposals of Tokyo will never take effect. The current situation is nothing more than a set of tricks performed by the military headquarters in Changchun and Tianjin. I do not know what means the authorities will take to break through this extraordinary environment. Is the current environment the final moment? I will stop writing and observe what happens next.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Pressure Never Ceases; Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Our Side Has Done Its Utmost in Peaceful Efforts; They Deliberately Seek to Expand the Situation and Have Other Intentions; All Subsequent Responsibility Should Be Borne by Japan</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement on the resumption of hostilities by the Japanese army in Langfang and other places on the 27th:</p>
<p>"Since the unprovoked attack by the Japanese army on our garrison at Lugouqiao on the night of the 7th of this month, although the responsibility was entirely not on our side, our authorities have always expressed their willingness to seek appropriate solutions through diplomatic means for the sake of East Asian peace. Our Minister of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly made formal proposals to the Japanese side, agreeing on a date for the withdrawal of troops by both sides. Unfortunately, the Japanese side has not only failed to accept our repeated expressions and proposals for peace, but has also greatly increased its troops and concentrated them in Beiping and Tianjin. At the same time, a solution was agreed upon with our authorities. After receiving the report, our central government, after observing the content, found that it was not significantly different from our established policy. In order to carry out the original intention of peace, we did not object. Our side's extreme tolerance and the painstaking efforts to maintain peace should be clear to Chinese and foreign people. We thought that the Japanese troops on the front line could withdraw from now on, and the troops in the rear could also stop advancing. However, in the past week, the Japanese army has not only shown no sign of withdrawing, but also continued to send large numbers of troops from various parts of Japan and Korea to Beiping and Tianjin. On the evening of the 25th, they also launched an unprovoked attack on our garrison in Langfang, followed by aerial bombing. On the 26th, they made unreasonable demands to our local officials and provoked incidents in the suburbs of Beiping. Their deliberate intention to expand the situation and their ulterior motives are already obvious. For the past two weeks, our side has done its utmost in peaceful efforts. All subsequent responsibility for the situation should be entirely borne by the Japanese side." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<h3>Britain Expresses Hope to Japan to Avoid War</h3>
<p>Eden Reports in the House of Commons Yesterday; Instructions Issued to the Chargé d'Affaires in Japan</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden reported to the House of Commons today on the latest news of the Sino-Japanese conflict in Langfang, saying that he had just received a report that the Japanese army would take action inside and outside the city of Beiping. He instructed the British Chargé d'Affaires in Japan to urgently express to the Japanese government the hope of avoiding such actions. The British government continued to express to the Chinese and Japanese governments its concern for a peaceful solution. He knew that the French and American governments had similar actions in Nanjing and Tokyo. The British government is still in constant contact with other interested governments, such as the Soviet Union and the United States. As for local plans to protect British citizens, they still exist and can be implemented in the event of an incident. (Reuters dispatch from the 27th via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Serious Situation in North China Urges Britain and the United States to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Our Ambassadors Visit the Authorities of the Two Countries; The United States Adopts a Strict Neutral Stance</p>
<p>[London] The Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, recently visited Foreign Secretary Eden and declared that the Chinese government had approved a certain agreement reached between Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, and the Japanese garrison in North China to maintain peace. (Havas dispatch from the 27th via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, issued a statement today, alleging that Japan wants to revive the plan to separate the five provinces of North China from the central government. Guo also visited Foreign Secretary Eden today to inform him of the serious situation in North China. (Guomin Telegraph from the 26th)</p>
<p>[London] It was announced here late last night that the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, visited Foreign Secretary Eden at the Foreign Office yesterday morning to discuss the North China Incident. According to a statement issued by the Chinese Embassy regarding the meeting between Eden and Guo, the Chinese government, although it considered the conditions agreed upon by Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, and the Japanese military authorities to be "radical and provocative," had agreed to approve them for the sake of seeking peace. However, by the end of last week, all peaceful efforts had proven to be completely unsuccessful. Under such circumstances, China must notify all countries in the world and ask them to pay attention to future events, and China is forced to make final preparations. (Haitong Telegraph from the 27th)</p>
<p>[London] The Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, hosted a luncheon today for Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of that country. Among the guests were Soviet Ambassador Maisky. Kong plans to travel to Paris around the 29th of this month. (Havas dispatch from the 27th via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, met with Secretary of State Hull today to explain the "serious situation in North China." At the same time, Japanese Ambassador Saito also visited Hull, claiming that the Chinese army had opened fire. (Guomin Telegraph from the 26th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Officials here are still paying close attention to the situation in the Far East, but they do not want to elaborate on the current situation. The US government is still maintaining a cautious attitude, no different from when the conflict between China and Japan occurred in North China. Regarding the situation of the conflict, the reports received from North China often contradict each other. The US authorities cannot use this to determine the cause of the incident. In short, the State Department has always hoped to maintain a strict neutral stance, and officials have the impression that Secretary of State Hull is trying to avoid emulating the actions of former Secretary of State Stimson and try to place the US government in a purely legal position. The lessons of the September 18th Incident in 1931 have led the current leaders of the United States to believe that lodging strong protests is ineffective and can create a tense atmosphere between the United States and Japan or the United States and China. According to general experts, the dispute between China and Japan has always been a local event, and all actions of the United States are aimed at making the dispute localized. However, so far, the State Department has stated that it will continue to take an observing attitude towards the North China Incident and does not intend to make any new representations to the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors to the United States.

What Japan expects is to eliminate the root causes of such unfortunate incidents, not to antagonize good people, and has no territorial ambitions. It will spare no effort to protect the rights and interests of all countries. Japan's mission is to ensure peace in East Asia.

<h3>Four Japanese Military Airfields Completed Near Beijing and Tianjin</h3>
<p>One Hundred Aircraft Parked, Reconnaissance Flights Four Times Daily, Huitong Company Aircraft Actually Used by Japanese Military</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: The Japanese military is sparing no effort in reinforcing troops and transporting equipment to Beijing and Tianjin. The urgency of their preparations clearly demonstrates that the eve of a major war has arrived. If hostilities break out, the Japanese will definitely use their air force as the main force in their attacks against us. Therefore, the Japanese are building airfields to serve as air force bases. They have been actively engaged in this work in recent days, and four military airfields have already been completed near Beijing and Tianjin as of the 25th. The locations, acreage, and other details of the airfields are roughly as follows: (1) Kangzhuang Airfield, including areas near Dongdayao and Zaojiacun near Fengtai, forcibly seized 1,500 mu of civilian land. Last week, more than 200 laborers were seized in the area and forced to cut and clear crops and flatten stream embankments. The work has already been completed. Currently, aircraft hangars and gas stations are being built in the Kangzhuang area, and they should be completed soon. Currently, more than 20 reconnaissance aircraft are parked at the airfield, flying daily to Beijing, Wanping, Baoding, Changxindian, and other places to conduct reconnaissance of our rear areas. (2) Beikou Airfield, bordering Yiyu and Liu'anzhuang villages in Jinbei Township, forcibly seized 1,450 mu of civilian land. Although the county residents petitioned the county government to negotiate and stop the seizure, their efforts were ultimately ineffective. After the Japanese completed the airfield, they dispatched a large contingent of troops to station there, ostensibly to protect the aircraft, and set up sentry posts within half a li of the airfield. All the residents who originally lived in the village have fled. In addition, there are reports that the existing Japanese airfields at Dongjuzi Limingzhuang and Nankai Balitai are also being expanded. According to investigations, the four Japanese military airfields mentioned above house a total of 100 reconnaissance aircraft and bombers. From morning to evening, in groups of seven or eight, or more than ten, they fly in formation over Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding at low altitudes. The residents have become accustomed to this and are no longer surprised. It is also learned that the construction projects at the Kangzhuang and Beicang airfields were surveyed and designed by Okabe, the group leader of the Shanhui Tong Aviation Company, and instructor Maeda. All of the aircraft belonging to the Huitong Company are now being supplied to the Japanese military. The company was originally a joint venture funded by China and Japan, but now we can no longer interfere in its internal affairs. (25th)</p>
<h3>Two Chiefs of Japanese Special Service Agencies in Chahar Head to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Reporting on the Situation in Chahar, Requesting Instructions on Planned Actions</p>
<p>Wanquan Communication: The bandit puppets in Chahar are gradually moving eastward and have conscripted a large number of laborers in the Mandankou and Bolicaihou'ershan areas within Zhangbei in eastern Chahar to rush construction of defensive works overnight. Zhang Haipeng's puppet troops in Rehe have also been deployed to western Rehe and have entered Chahar to establish contact with the puppet forces of Lu, resulting in frequent military movements in many areas of Zhangbei and breaking the silence of the past. As for the purpose of these actions by the bandit puppets, it is currently difficult to determine. On the 24th, according to a Japanese source, amidst the rumors of troop deployments by the bandit puppets, Kuwahara, the chief of the Japanese special service agency in Zhangbei, and Yuta, the chief of the special service agency in Huade, suddenly received a telegram from Commander Hyakutake of the Japanese army in Tianjin on the 23rd, summoning them to Tianjin. Yuta immediately rushed to Zhangbei and, at noon, boarded an airplane with Kuwahara to Tianjin to report on the local situation in Chahar and the recent activities of the bandit puppets, and to request instructions on future planned actions. It is generally believed that after Kuwahara and others return, there will be new changes in the situation in Chahar. As for the Japanese and Korean residents in various counties of Chahar, they have long been preparing to withdraw, heading to Rehe and Shenyang, or returning directly to their home countries. As of the 24th, there were still a small number of Japanese personnel in the Zhangbei and Huade special service agencies, but the rest had already withdrawn. In addition, the Zhangbei and Huade special service agencies have recently been dispatching Chinese traitors to various counties to purchase large quantities of supplies and transport them to Zhangbei and Rehe, and are rushing to build defensive fortifications. Their actions are becoming increasingly active.</p>
<p>On the bandit puppet side, due to the fact that the funds provided by the Japanese have not increased, they have recently been engaged in exploiting the people. In addition to the various exorbitant taxes on club membership, livestock, and domestic dogs, they have added a new type of pot tax. Each household is limited to using only one pot, regardless of the size of the population. If a household is found to have any other cooking utensils resembling a pot, they will be required to pay an additional eight jiao per month. The people of Chahar are resentful due to the heavy taxes and levies in recent times, and their complaints have reached their limit.</p>
<p>News from the people's army is somewhat subdued. According to a source from Chongli County, Zhao Xiangzeng and Tiankou, righteous people who killed the puppet police chief Jie Qi in Zhalakou Village, Chongli County on June 1st to defend themselves, have been hiding in the countryside since their defeat, secretly gathering comrades and often ambushing the bandit puppets. The bandit puppets are also at their wit's end trying to cope with their unpredictable appearances. On the 21st of this month, dozens of Mongolian soldiers from the puppet Sixth Division were on patrol near Gougedalaogou in Chongli County when they encountered armed civilians led by Tiankou. Tiankou directed his troops to surround the Mongolian soldiers, confiscate all their weapons, and release the surviving Mongolian soldiers to show their strength. After receiving the news, the puppet troops stationed in Chongli County intensified their alert overnight to prevent a sudden attack. (24th)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Expulsion of Treacherous Merchant Lou Hongrui</p>
<p>Lou Hongrui, the owner of the Lou Tai Optical Shop in Chuanzhu Alley within the city, received a prize of 1,000 yuan from the Shanghai Dongya Company for purchasing and using Rendan (a brand of medicine). Lou then published huge advertisements in the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao, Dagongbao, and other newspapers to promote Rendan. All sectors of Wuxian County felt that Lou's actions were insane and reckless. The Anti-Enemy Support Association of all sectors filed an accusation and decided at a meeting on the 26th to expel Lou Hongrui from the territory within three days. The police station in charge summoned Lou to the station on the morning of the 27th, and then sent him to the First Police Station for transfer to the General Bureau, ordering him to leave the territory within the specified time. It is also learned that Lou had received more than ten warning letters from various parties in the north in recent days.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Summoned to Shanghai</p>
<p>There are a total of more than seventy Japanese residents in Suzhou. Since the outbreak of the Hebei war, more than ten of them have left Suzhou and returned to their home country. The remaining women and children are preparing their luggage, and more than two hundred pieces of valuable items have been shipped to Shanghai in advance. The Japanese Consul in Suzhou, Shi Koushiu San, rushed to Shanghai at 9 AM on the 27th after receiving a telegram from the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai to discuss important matters.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Organizing a Rescue Committee</p>
<p>The county government organized a rescue committee. On the 26th, Dian Cai from the Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Jiesun from the Kuomintang Party Department, Wei Zuxian from the County Hospital, Yu Jiusi from the Red Cross Society, and Gu Jianshan from the Western Medical Association were appointed as committee members. They plan to begin by investigating health personnel and strengthening rescue capabilities.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Leader of Kidnapping Gang Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Zhou Zhipeng (aka Zhou Tingqian), the leader of a major kidnapping and extortion case on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, was hiding in Shanghai. The Zhejiang Provincial Security Command learned of this and sent detectives to work with the police to arrest him. After being interrogated in Hangzhou, the suspect confessed that he had been a bandit for twenty years and had committed kidnapping and other crimes. He was sentenced to death according to law. After being approved by the Military Affairs Commission, the suspect Zhou Zhangjian, a bandit who kidnapped and shot a patrol leader, was also sentenced to death. At 9 AM on the 27th, Wu Ding, the captain of the military police inspection team, led a team to take the two bandits from the military prison and escort them to the Wulongkou execution ground outside Tai Gate. They were executed by firing squad at 10:50 AM. Those who repented and turned themselves in, and those who were accessories to the crimes, were sentenced to imprisonment and sent to prison to serve their sentences.</p>

<h3>Japan Exhibits Military Might, Holds Major Determination Towards China</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Konoe Explains Purpose of Dispatching Troops, Still Hopes for Fundamental Readjustment of Sino-Japanese Relations, Seeks Local Resolution of North China Incident</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In his parliamentary address, Prime Minister Konoe stated the following regarding the China issue: It is truly regrettable that the North China Incident has erupted. The government was compelled to make a major decision, which has received the unanimous support of the nation. I am deeply grateful. The purpose of dispatching troops is to maintain peace in East Asia as stated in the declaration. I sincerely hope that the Chinese government and people will "reflect on themselves and exercise self-discipline" and promptly fundamentally readjust Sino-Japanese relations. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The clash at Guang'anmen on the night of the 26th caused great shock. On the morning of the 27th, all newspapers issued special editions reporting detailed news. The Minister of War held an important meeting at 6 AM, and an emergency cabinet meeting was held at 8 AM. It is rumored that an important statement will be issued. Foreign Minister Hirota stated in his parliamentary address on the morning of the 27th that the first point to note is China's strengthening of its organization and its use of anti-Japanese spirit and movements as a means of unifying domestic public opinion and promoting national consciousness. Next, he stated that Japan's fundamental policy towards East Asia is to seek the harmony and cooperation of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, prevent the eastward spread of the Red influence, and realize stability in East Asia. He earnestly hopes that China will have a full understanding and recognition of this fundamental policy as soon as possible. Finally, he stated regarding the incident that the Japanese government, as stated in its declaration of the 11th, will maintain the policy of resolving the situation locally and not expanding the incident. Therefore, on the one hand, it is striving for a peaceful resolution locally, and on the other hand, it is working to ensure that China can properly handle the situation in order to quickly settle the situation. What is hoped is that the Chinese side will quickly reflect on itself and honestly implement the agreed-upon settlement. In short, the key to this incident lies with China. I expect China to live up to Japan's hopes and take effective and appropriate measures to quickly end the situation. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hirota Koki's Speech on Diplomacy</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota delivered the following diplomatic speech at the special parliamentary session today:</p>
<p>Ensuring the position of the stabilizing force in East Asia and contributing to the establishment of genuine world peace is the national policy of the Japanese Empire, and this need not be reiterated. When it comes to its implementation, the first thing to consider is the relationship between Japan, China, Manchukuo, and the Soviet Union, which I firmly believe. Looking at the recent situation in China, the so-called anti-Japanese spirit is promoted, even becoming a movement, with organization, strengthening, and utilization, aiming at the Japanese Empire as a means to unify domestic public opinion and encourage national consciousness. Based on the above situation, unfortunate incidents have repeatedly occurred, which the Imperial Government finds extremely regrettable. When the Chengdu Incident broke out, the Imperial Government immediately wanted to correct China's attitude towards Japan, which had hindered Sino-Japanese relations, and to seek its expression on specific issues such as improving national relations and the sincerity of the government. However, unfortunately, the negotiations were stalled due to opposition from the Chinese side. Since then, the relations between China and Japan, frankly speaking, can hardly be considered satisfactory. The fundamental policy of the Japanese Empire in East Asia is to promote harmony and cooperation between Japan, China, and Manchukuo in order to prevent the spread of Red influence and to achieve stability in East Asia. This need not be reiterated. Therefore, the Imperial Government earnestly hopes that the Chinese side will gain a full understanding and recognition of this fundamental policy as soon as possible. However, in fact, the Chinese side not only lacks the above understanding and recognition, but also the anti-Japanese spirit has intensified in recent times. Even the Lugouqiao Incident suddenly broke out on the night of the 7th of this month, which is nothing more than a result of the previous cause. The attitude of the Imperial Government towards this incident was already declared on the 11th of this month, and the policy is to resolve the situation locally and not to expand the incident, attempting a peaceful solution, while at the same time doing its best to hope that Nanjing will find a way to handle it properly and quickly resolve the situation. This is why I strongly hope that the Chinese side will reflect as soon as possible and earnestly fulfill the conditions agreed upon by both sides on the evening of the 11th of this month for a local resolution. The Imperial Government's attitude has been conveyed in detail by its ambassadors abroad to the governments of various countries, and it has received their full understanding. However, depending on the attitude of the Nanjing government, the reaction of the general public in China cannot be viewed with optimism, and there is a risk of inciting unfortunate incidents. Therefore, we have repeatedly urged the Chinese central and local authorities to pay attention to cracking down on anti-Japanese behavior and protecting Japanese residents in order to cope with the evolution of the situation and to ensure complete safety. In short, the key to resolving this incident depends entirely on the actions of the Chinese side. I expect the Chinese side to accept our hopes and quickly end the situation with appropriate and effective measures.</p>
<p>Resolving Pending Issues with Russia</p>
<p>As for relations with the Soviet Union, the government should consider them carefully. However, incidents still occur repeatedly on the border between Manchukuo and the Soviet Union. In particular, recently, the Soviet border guards illegally invaded an island in the Heilongjiang River belonging to the territory of Manchukuo, resulting in a conflict between the Japanese-Manchukuo forces and them. The situation was dangerous for a time. Afterwards, an agreement was reached with the Soviet Union to restore the status quo in that area, thereby resolving the situation. The Japanese Empire is extremely concerned about the situation in which incidents occur from time to time on the border between Manchukuo and the Soviet Union. In order to prevent border disputes, it believes that it is necessary to study practical methods to deal with the unresolved national borders and the resolution of their disputes. It plans to set up two committees to ease the atmosphere on the border and quickly take appropriate measures. Therefore, the Soviet side should also be open-minded and do its best to assist. I believe that I must urge the Soviet Union to reflect deeply. The government should protect the legitimate business operations of Japanese fishermen in the northern seas and Japanese merchants mining oil and coal in North Sakhalin, and pay close attention to them. Any business operated in accordance with treaties must not be allowed to become a mere formality. In short, there are still many problems between Japan and the Soviet Union that need to be resolved urgently, and the government should make full efforts. Relations between the United Kingdom and Japan have been strengthened by the participation of Prince Chichibu and his wife, representatives of the Japanese Emperor, in the coronation ceremony of the British monarch. I am deeply grateful. The government has always maintained its policy of promoting friendship between Japan and the United Kingdom. Recently, in order to adjust relations between the two countries, we have been discussing openly with each other, and our opinions are converging. We should quickly promote this.</p>
<p>Relations between Japan and the United States have been extremely good recently, and the degree of friendship has increased. The previous visit of our economic mission to the United States to exchange views openly with various sectors revealed that the two countries have much in common in terms of economy and other aspects. This is a source of great satisfaction to me.</p>
<p>Utilizing the German-Japanese Agreement</p>
<p>Our country concluded the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact last year, and the government plans to utilize this agreement effectively, while at the same time hoping that relations between the two countries will become closer in the future.</p>
<p>Developing Foreign Trade</p>
<p>As for trade relations, both imports and exports are extremely important, and they are also essential conditions for our country's survival. In particular, given our current economic situation, it goes without saying that this is one of the most important countermeasures to achieve a balance of payments. However, observing the current situation in various countries, they still have various obstacles to our country's export trade in terms of economic and financial affairs and other various situations. Therefore, the government should deal with the other country separately, depending on the actual situation, or conclude an agreement with them, or discuss it with merchants from each other, in an attempt to smooth our country's export trade. Fortunately, since this spring, it has been conducting trade negotiations with India, Myanmar, the Dutch East Indies, Turkey, and other countries. I believe that this is quite gratifying. The government should continue to strive to maintain the development of commercial rights, and at the same time, it must also do its best to obtain raw material resources freely and promote the freedom of international trade. Recently, international trade has shown a slight tendency to restore freedom, which is a welcome phenomenon. I am originally willing to cooperate in international efforts to concretize this tendency, and I am now declaring this. (27th Allied Press Telegram)</p>

<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Minister of War Sugiyama gave a lengthy speech in the Diet on the events of the North China Incident, concluding that the situation had been caused by Chinese military obstruction, which had endangered the protection of Japanese residents and the security of the transportation lines between Beijing and Tianjin. The garrison troops could no longer tolerate this, and in order to carry out their mission and for self-defense, they had decided to decisively punish the Chinese.

<h3>Japanese Special Diet Begins Questioning and Debate</h3>
<p>Konoe's Defense Conceals Aggression, Diet Members' Attitudes Extremely Tense</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives convened at 1:02 PM on the 27th with a ringing of the bell. With the North China Incident imminent, the Diet members showed extreme tension. The visitors' gallery was packed with those who wanted to hear the first words of the Konoe Cabinet. At 1:13 PM, Speaker Oyama announced the opening of the session and made some reports. Next, Prime Minister Konoe took the stage amidst applause to deliver a policy speech, the words of which were the same as those he had spoken in the House of Peers. Next was Foreign Minister Hirota's diplomatic speech, followed by Finance Minister Kaya's financial speech. After the speeches were finished at 1:26 PM, the Minister of War and Minister of the Navy gave explanations regarding the North China Incident. Afterwards, Speaker Oyama read a thank-you note for the resolution to thank the military officers and soldiers who had been dispatched to China, which was approved. After the Minister of War and Minister of the Navy expressed their thanks, the questioning began. The first to take the stage was Ogata Kotaro, who asked the following:</p>
<p>How will the fundamental readjustment of Japanese-Chinese relations be implemented? What beliefs and concrete measures do you have to eradicate anti-Japanese, insulting-Japanese, and anti-Japanese incidents in China?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Konoe took the stage to answer as follows:</p>
<p>China's anti-Japanese and anti-Japanese sentiments have a long history and cannot be resolved in a day or two. The first step in fundamentally adjusting Japanese-Chinese relations is to make China fully understand our true intentions. Our true intentions are that we have no intention of aggression against Chinese territory. China's violence and our forbearance to date can prove that we have no intention of territorial aggression. What we ask of the Chinese side is not territory but cooperation. The so-called cooperation is that Japan and China should stand together and jointly contribute to the promotion and development of Oriental culture. (27th Allied Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>British Upper House Discusses Warship Cannon Size</h3>
<p>Fourteen-Inch Caliber Superior to Sixteen-Inch</p>
<p>[London] British Minister of Education, Stanhope, stated in the Upper House today during a debate on the London Naval Treaty, representing the government, that because Japan has refused to limit warship cannon caliber to fourteen inches, the Admiralty must now consider whether it is appropriate, if Britain intends to limit the tonnage of its battleships to 25,000 tons, to equip them with fourteen-inch caliber cannons, or whether it is necessary to equip them with sixteen-inch caliber cannons. Stanhope further stated that the range of a fourteen-inch caliber cannon is no less than that of a sixteen-inch cannon. "If we can use fourteen-inch cannons to fiercely bombard the enemy, while the enemy's sixteen-inch cannons fire slowly, we will certainly gain the upper hand." Stanhope continued, "The Admiralty is closely monitoring the current situation. If Japan or other countries build warships exceeding 35,000 tons, or cannon calibers exceeding the limits of the naval treaty, then Britain or other countries will be able to build corresponding warships to cope with the situation, based on an automatic escalation ratio." Whether these warships will be of a superior type, have greater speed, and larger cannon calibers than Japanese ships is a matter for experts. Stanhope concluded that he hopes Japan will realize this and agree to the restrictions, which would also be in Japan's best interest. Even if they do not sign the naval treaty, they can still act in accordance with it and not make things too difficult for us or other countries." (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Comments on Unchecked Japanese Ambitions</h3>
<p>[London] The Daily Herald today published an editorial discussing Japan's demand for the withdrawal of the 37th Chinese Division, stating that this is a step closer to Japan's annexation of the three eastern provinces of China.

<h3>Heavy Losses for Spanish Government Forces, Uncertain Future</h3>
<p>Many Tanks and Aircraft Lost, Rebels Continue to Attack Madrid</p>
<p>[Paris] According to news from French sources in Spain, the future of the Spanish government forces is extremely bleak. It is reported that the government forces lost fifty tanks on the Madrid front in the past three days of fierce fighting, and the troops they relied on as their elite force have now been almost completely wiped out. Furthermore, a battalion of soldiers defected and surrendered to the Nationalist forces. In addition, when the Nationalist forces captured the two villages of Roilla and Caroma de yesterday, the government forces suffered 1,000 casualties, and the entire government army has now collapsed. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Saramonca: The authorities here today declared that in the past three weeks, Nationalist forces on the Madrid front have shot down a total of 106 government aircraft, proving the Nationalist forces' air superiority. Many of the downed aircraft were fighters, including 37 shot down in aerial combat. According to a senior officer of General Franco's air force, speaking to a Reuters reporter today, the Boeing aircraft used by the government forces are Soviet-made imitations of American designs and are of poor design. Although their flight speed can reach 240 miles per hour, they cannot be operated freely at high speeds. The Curtiss fighters have lower speeds but are easier to control, but the armament placement is very inadequate. The government's large bombers, the newest of which are equipped with seven machine guns, rarely launch attacks without fighter escort. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Soviet Government Implements Purge</h3>
<p>Large Numbers of Important Figures Arrested</p>
<p>[Moscow] Since Stalin launched a vigorous purge in May of this year, the composition of the All-Union Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union (i.e., the Soviet Cabinet) has undergone major changes. Regarding the Central Executive Committee, the two deputy chairmen, Kiviyagov and Goyayev, and the Central Executive Committee member Golodette, have been formally dismissed. Kiviyagov has also committed suicide. In addition, Executive Committee members Rutzupek and Enshilide are now in prison, so five of the original Central Executive Committee members are gone. As for the members of the Council of People's Commissars who have been dismissed, there are six: Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Madame Entib, and Rutzupek. Foreign Trade People's Commissar Rosengoltz, Food People's Commissar Kalmanovich, Agriculture People's Commissar Chernov, and Public Health People's Commissar Kaminsky. In addition, rumors have spread that Education People's Commissar Bubnov has been arrested, but recently a naming ceremony was held at a park in Moscow, which was still named "Bubnov Park," indicating that the above rumors are inaccurate. Regarding the governments of the various Soviet republics, the chairmen of the Council of People's Commissars of the Byelorussian SSR, the Georgian SSR, and the Uzbek SSR have all been dismissed. Furthermore, the former deputy director of the Pesi News Agency, Mankes, has been arrested, while the director of the agency, Tauraisi, has been declared an "enemy of the people" and has therefore committed suicide out of fear of punishment. Many senior officials of the Ukrainian SSR radio station have also been arrested for engaging in sabotage. It is expected that a similar purge will soon occur in the Byelorussian SSR. Finally, many Polish, German, Austrian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian communist party members have been arrested, and the manager of the Moscow branch of the National Bank, Gortberg, has also been dismissed for having a relationship with his father (who is a White Russian émigré residing abroad).

<h3>China Establishes Tea Company</h3>
<p>Discussion Raised in British House of Commons</p>
<p>[London] At today's meeting of the House of Commons, National Conservative Party Member of Parliament, Errington, inquired about the Chinese National Tea Company, stating that the Chinese government's establishment of a government agency for the production and sale of tea, in competition with private individuals, would greatly harm the interests of the British. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that he would consider the suggestions of British merchants, but no one has yet come forward. The Foreign Secretary also said that they will investigate the Chinese tea company. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Romanian King Visits Belgium</h3>
<p>Rumors of Trip to Germany Inaccurate</p>
<p>[Paris] After recently visiting Britain and France, King Carol II of Romania arrived in Brussels, Belgium, yesterday. Rumors that Carol II will also travel to Germany to meet with Führer Hitler when he returns home have been denied by well-informed Romanian sources here. The Romanian authorities have recently held talks with Britain and France to enhance the friendship between Romania and Britain and the alliance between Romania and France. Foreign countries are fabricating rumors in the hope of undermining them. Such despicable tactics cannot deceive anyone. It is reported that since former Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu left office last August, there has been some estrangement between France and Romania. Later, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck suddenly visited the Romanian capital and strengthened the alliance treaty between Poland and Romania, which is enough to show that Romania's foreign policy has changed course. It is generally believed that Romania is about to distance itself from the collective security principle of the League of Nations and the Little Entente, and cooperate with Poland to form a group of neutral countries between Germany and the Soviet Union, as a significant measure. When Carol I visited Britain and France this month, he felt that if Romania wanted to take diplomatic actions that would be detrimental to France's and Romania's allies, especially Czechoslovakia, the alliance treaty between Romania and France would inevitably be impossible to maintain. To cite one example, the Romanian government recently agreed with Poland to upgrade their respective envoys to ambassadors and requested that the British and French embassies also be upgraded. The French government immediately refused. However, if the French embassies in Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia could be upgraded to embassies at the same time, and the mutual assistance obligations borne by the countries of the Little Entente, originally limited to dealing with Hungarian aggression, could be extended to all acts of aggression, then the upgrading of the French embassy in Romania could be considered.

<h3>British Proposed List of Questions Opposed by Italy for Cancellation</h3>
<p>Now Based on Compromise Proposal, Requests Countries to Express Opinions</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a meeting at 4 p.m. today, lasting for four hours. The chairman, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Plymouth, presented the British government's proposed list of questions. The Italian representative, Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, made a lengthy statement, strongly stating that Italy approves of the compromise proposal put forward by Britain on July 14, but the proposal of the list of questions put forward by the British government undermines the various principles contained in the British compromise proposal, so Italy has to oppose it. However, if the item "recognizing both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents" is placed before the item "withdrawal of volunteers" in the list of questions, then he can also approve of it. Afterwards, the German representative, German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, and the Portuguese representative, Portuguese Ambassador to Britain, Monteiro, both spoke in support of Grandi's views and formally declared that if other countries accept recognizing both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents, then Germany and Portugal can, in principle, accept the method of withdrawing volunteers. Subsequently, the Soviet representative, Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, spoke, fiercely attacking Italy's attitude, saying that Italy's permission to withdraw volunteers is not trustworthy, and that the Soviet Union will never recognize the Spanish Nationalist government. Maisky's speech stirred the audience considerably. Finally, at the proposal of the chairman of the subcommittee, Plymouth, it was decided to abandon the proposal to present a list of questions, and the subcommittee will only request the governments of the relevant countries to express their opinions on the various points stipulated in the British compromise proposal before noon on the 29th of this month, so that the Adjustment Committee can hold a plenary meeting at 4 p.m. on the 30th to discuss it. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] When Chairman Plymouth presented the list of questions, the Italian representative also presented a list of questions with the same content as the British proposal. The chairman immediately stated that since the combined questions are a whole event, the order of the procedure does not need to be insisted upon, but the version sent to the various governments by the committee is still the original British proposal. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: According to reliable information, 3,000 Italian volunteers landed in Cadiz, Spain, today to assist the Spanish rebels in their operations.

<h3>American Congressman Criticizes Government for Selling Scrap Iron to Japan</h3>
<p>[Washington] Republican Congressman Crawford, who is known for being familiar with the situation in the Far East, today strongly criticized Secretary of State Hull, saying that Hull should not hinder Congress from restricting the export of scrap iron, especially to Japan. Some quarters in Congress believe that the export of scrap iron indirectly facilitates wars abroad, and that this scrap iron should also be kept within the country. Now Japan and other countries are increasing their purchases of it, and Hull still claims that the method of indirect restriction is not worth the effort, resulting in America's scrap iron being exhausted, while foreign ironworks are working day and night to make weapons of destruction with it.

<h3>French Communist and Socialist Parties Express Sympathy for China</h3>
<p>[Paris] After the National Congress of the Republican Socialist Union Party (formerly led by Premier Peng Gu, one of the parties participating in the People's Front) concluded yesterday, the party's permanent delegation passed a resolution on the Sino-Japanese issue, stating, "The Republic of China is a member state of the League of Nations and is currently working hard to carry out construction work. Now, this peaceful organization has suddenly suffered brutal aggression. Although the purpose of the aggressor is not explicitly stated, everyone in the party knows it. Our party hereby expresses its sympathy for China and encourages it." The resolution also advocates that all signatory countries of the existing treaties protecting the territorial integrity of China should not recognize such attempts at force. The League of Nations should also lodge a protest and consider various methods to save peace and uphold justice. (Central News Agency, 26th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Hongkou Japanese Residents Organize Civilian Police</h3>

<h3>Pinghu Bans Rice from Coming to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Soy and Rice Industry Association Asks for Negotiation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Soy and Rice Industry Association's Beishi Office received reports from more than 10,000 member stores stating that the Pinghu County government has now banned the export of rice, preventing the transportation of more than 1,000 dan of rice purchased by these rice stores from Shengyuan Rice Store in Pinghu to Shanghai. The impact on commerce is small, but the impact on people's food is great. Shanghai's food supply has always relied on supplies from the interior. During this extraordinary period, if the interior prohibits the transportation of food to Shanghai, the future of Shanghai's food supply will be unimaginable. Therefore, the Soy and Rice Industry Association has specifically sent a letter requesting the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to negotiate a lifting of the ban to maintain the people's food supply, it is said.</p>
<h3>Committee Asks All Sectors to Donate and Purchase Gas Masks</h3>

Patriotic people from all walks of life who wish to purchase and donate gas masks can contact the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge to purchase and prepare them and send them to the Ministry of Military Affairs or the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for collection and forwarding to the front lines.</p>
<h3>Students Studying in Japan Strictly Inspected by Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>160 People Arrived Yesterday, Huang Yihuan Has Been Released</p>
<p>Our students studying in Japan have already voluntarily returned to the country in batches. Yesterday, the Changxing Company's Empress of Japan arrived in Shanghai carrying more than 100 people, and the Nagasaki Maru returned with more than 60 people. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency met with Mr. Yan, a student who returned yesterday, and inquired about the recent situation of our students in Tokyo. According to him, there are currently still 500 students studying in Japan, and they also plan to return soon. Currently, due to the limited number of ship berths, they have not been able to return to the country at the same time. When we were in Japan, the general Japanese public did not pay much attention, but the police department's youth group and ronin were extremely strict in their surveillance. Due to the poor environment and the longing for the motherland, everyone urgently wanted to return. Recently, Japan has made exaggerated publicity about North China, causing the general public to gradually develop a negative impression of the students. The police department has recently become more cautious about our students returning home. In the past, students could take foreign ships back to the country very freely, but this time they must register, be strictly questioned, and have their luggage inspected. If three or five people travel together, they will be subject to even closer scrutiny. As for the students currently staying in Tokyo, since the arrest of Yang Xianwu of the World Translation Agency, they have been terrified of the security situation. At that time, they jointly decided to plead with the central authorities and Ambassador Xu to find ways to protect them and rescue the seven students currently imprisoned in Tokyo. At the same time, they decided to return to the country in batches to serve the country. When Ambassador Xu recently returned to his post, the students in Tokyo warmly welcomed him, singing party songs in pain and shouting "Long live China" three times, which was extremely壮烈. The Japanese filmed it as a segment of the North China Incident. Later, the students elected five representatives, including myself, to visit Ambassador Xu to request rescue. Ambassador Xu encouraged us with the four words "calm and composure" and was quite affectionate and attentive to the students studying in Japan, but the Supervision Office did not make any statement. Until I left Japan, Huang Yihuan, who had been arrested, was actively rescued because he was the son of the martyr Huang Xing and has now been released. The other seven are still missing. The safety of students staying in Tokyo is clearly not guaranteed. Now that we have returned to our homeland in sorrow, we have infinite feelings. We hope that all sectors will urge the embassy and the Student Supervision Office to pay close attention to the situation of students in Japan.</p>
<h3>No Private Goods Trading Association Discusses Ways to Stop Smuggling by Unscrupulous Merchants</h3>
<p>Yesterday, All Committee Members Were Notified to Attend</p>
<p>The Shanghai No Private Goods Trading Movement Committee, in view of this extraordinary period, is deeply afraid that unscrupulous merchants will be blinded by profit and take the opportunity to act. It has specifically scheduled a joint meeting of all committee members and design committee members this afternoon to discuss ways to stop smuggling. Yesterday, it issued an announcement stating: 'Dear Sir/Madam, the current situation is serious, and there is concern that unscrupulous merchants may use various methods to smuggle goods, disrupting the financial market. It is specifically scheduled to hold the sixth joint meeting of all committee members and design committee members at 4:00 PM on the 28th of this month (Wednesday) at the meeting place inside the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss ways to stop smuggling and various incoming documents. We hope that you will make time to attend promptly. This matter concerns national tax revenue, so please do not delay.'</p>
<h3>Shanghai Prepares to Store Salt to Cope with Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>Since the North China Incident occurred, all parties have been actively preparing to cope with extraordinary times. Food, in particular, is most important in relation to the people's livelihood and military needs. Salt is also an indispensable daily necessity. Therefore, the authorities in this port are urgently seeking to store salt to prepare for contingencies. At the same time, non-salt-producing provinces in the interior have always found salt difficult to obtain. Therefore, they have all invited salt transportation agencies to discuss salt storage methods, it is said.</p>

Subsequently, the committee members reported on the situation of various silk mills running out of raw materials and successively suspending work after Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces banned the export of dry cocoons. The meeting adjourned around 7:00 PM. The text of the public and private telegrams to Zhejiang Province is recorded below:</p>
<p>Revoke the Ban</p>
<p>To Zhu Jun, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: According to reports from member silk mills, the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee has announced a ban on the export of dry cocoons. The factories purchased dry cocoons in Zhejiang Province this spring to supplement the raw materials for silk reeling and urgently need to transport and use them. If the ban is not lifted, the silk mills will be forced to close and the workers will lose their livelihoods. We have no choice but to request that the ban be revoked. It is respectfully submitted that the silk mills in Shanghai purchase most of the cocoons they need from Zhejiang Province. The encouragement has been given for many years, so the cocoons in Zhejiang have today's prosperity, and Shanghai merchants have contributed to it. Now, banning the transportation of purchased cocoons out of the province will inevitably lead to a severe shortage of raw materials in the silk mills, leading to the risk of suspension of work and collapse. The relationship is by no means superficial. In addition to submitting it directly to the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee, we are urgently telegraphing to request that you take into consideration the distressed and urgent situation of the silk mills and order the Sericulture Control Committee to revoke the ban on the export of cocoons. The Shanghai Silk Mills Industry Association respectfully submits this with utmost gratitude.</p>
<p>Allow Cocoon Collection</p>
<p>(Titles Omitted) According to reports from member silk mills such as Shunfeng Liyuan, the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee has promulgated management methods for cocoon collection by cocoon merchants throughout the province. According to the provisions of Article 6, the raw materials of Shanghai silk mills are affected. Please forward the report for investigation and commutation. The matter was brought up at a meeting of all silk mill representatives on June 18. It was jointly believed that compared with Zhejiang, the number of silk reeling factories and silk workers in Shanghai is greater than in Zhejiang, and the raw materials of silk mills have always been purchased from Zhejiang. There is a long history of prosperity in the sericulture industry in Zhejiang, and there is a relationship between the various silk mills and Zhejiang farmers in distributing seeds. If the restrictions of Article 6 of the method are imposed, the raw materials of Shanghai factories will be panicked. It is not half of the truth. The public decided to telegraph to ask for investigation and commutation. In the past, there were no silk reeling factories in Zhejiang, and cocoons were only supplied for the production of local silk. Shanghai merchants were forced to use Zhejiang cocoons, encouraging rural farmers to plant mulberry trees and raise silkworms, and thus achieved today's prosperity. In terms of history, there should be no boundaries. Farmers in various cocoon areas in Zhejiang all have merchants going to distribute seeds again. Now, according to this method, ordinary registration must be handled after the silk mills in the province have completed registration and there is a surplus. In other words, the registration of Shanghai merchants has been rejected. According to the theory of sentiment, it is not in line with the loss of each other. Wise men do not advocate the views of others. This method does not consider this and leads to partiality. We respectfully request that you take into consideration the sentiments of the people and approve the instruction of the Sericulture Control Committee to revise Article 6 of the cocoon collection management method, allowing Shanghai silk mills to register together to show impartiality. The Shanghai Silk Mills Industry Association respectfully submits this with utmost gratitude.</p>
<p>There are also telegrams and documents from the Fourth and Sixth District Silk Reeling Workers' Unions in this city, as well as the Municipal Government and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the revocation of the cocoon ban. Due to the length of the text, it is omitted.</p>

<h3>Junkers Aircraft Had a Minor Accident During a Test Flight in Longhua the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Pilot Mr. Liu Injured in the Foot, Damage is Still Minor, Currently Being Repaired</p>
<p>A Junkers aircraft of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation had an accident during a test flight at Longhua Airport on the 26th due to damage to some of its parts, resulting in damage to the aircraft's wings and injuries to the pilot, Mr. Liu. According to a reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency, the aircraft damaged the morning before yesterday was a Junkers small aircraft made by the German Junkers aircraft factory, which can accommodate six passengers and pilots. In the past, the aircraft was rotated on various routes of the company, such as Zhengzhou. Not long ago, it came to Shanghai's machine factory for inspection of parts and repairs as usual. The inspection and repairs were completed two days ago, so Mr. Liu, a Chinese pilot of the company, conducted a test flight at Longhua Airport on the morning of the 26th. The aircraft performed very well during takeoff and flight in the air, but when the test flight was completed and it was descending, the aircraft's wheels suddenly burst, causing the engine to detach from the fuselage due to vibration. Fortunately, the aircraft was close to the ground, and Mr. Liu responded immediately by braking the propeller, so the aircraft landed in farmland not far from Longhua Airport. The fuselage did not tilt, and fortunately, there was no major disaster. Other employees of the Eurasia Company rushed to the scene after hearing the news and immediately rescued the pilot, Mr. Liu, from the aircraft. It was found that he was injured in the foot and immediately summoned an ambulance by telephone to take him to Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglin Bridge for treatment. It was said that the injury was not fatal and he would be fully recovered soon after treatment. The damage to the aircraft was investigated, and the fuselage was intact, but the right wing was damaged. Some parts that were thrown off during the vibration of the front of the aircraft had fallen into a nearby ditch, so the damage was not great. The aircraft has been transported back to the Eurasia Company's inspection shed for repairs and can still be used after repairs, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Cotton Industry Association Submits to the Ministry of Industry to Revise the Methods for Combating Speculation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Yarn Industry Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry yesterday requesting revisions to the methods for combating speculation. The document stated: 'We are submitting this document to request revisions to Items 3, 6, 7, and 9 of the methods for combating speculation in the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange. On July 6 of this year, we received the Ministry's promulgation of 12 items of methods for combating speculation in the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange. This is a clear order to reorganize the market, and all merchants should strictly abide by it to live up to the Ministry's intention to combat speculation. However, after investigation by our members, they believe that due to the needs of the facts and the customs of the past, this matter is of great importance and cannot be requested for major revisions. The details are listed below. Our members, business firms, engage in the import, export, and delivery of cotton from all over the country to factories, and act as agents for cotton merchants from all over the country to buy and sell. Because cotton merchants in the interior do not have branches in Shanghai, they mostly entrust member firms to quote prices by letter and telegram at any time as a basis for transportation. If the market price rises or falls, such as when the price in the producing area exceeds the market price, or the near and far futures prices in the market are different, or the cotton sold to yarn factories in advance suddenly changes due to weather conditions, or the huge rise and fall of foreign cotton has an impact, it is necessary to entrust member firms to entrust brokers to buy and sell futures in order to maintain costs and compensate for losses. These hedging and selling operations are comparable to the business of selling real goods for sale and offsetting the amount. If the third item stipulates that no commission may be made, not only will cotton merchants in the interior be unable to compensate, but also the principle of balancing prices will not be consistent. In our opinion, we would like to ask the Ministry to revise the third item to "All registered yarn factories or cotton yarn merchants may entrust brokers to buy and sell futures on behalf of cotton merchants in the interior, but may not entrust others to do so. When the Ministry of Industry conducts inspections according to law, it may check its books and records," so that it will still be based on the purpose of combating speculation, and cotton merchants in the interior will be protected. If the third item is approved for revision, then in the sixth item, in the phrase "regulations of the third item," a footnote should be added before the word "of." In the seventh item, in the phrase "futures trading established in accordance with the provisions of the third item," a footnote should also be added before the word "of." In the ninth item, "All futures for each month should be settled at the end of each month before the expiration date and may not be used for futures trading again," we investigated that the cotton production in our country has been gradually improved under the guidance of the government, but the quality and weaving characteristics have not yet been identified. Even the organization is mixed with fine, fine velvet is mixed with coarse, the grades are uneven, and the values are different. The US Department of Cotton identifies cotton grades, issues certificates, and can deliver them anytime and anywhere, and sets the 16th of the month as the last day. According to the customs of our country's market, futures trading for each month must be the last day until the 25th or 26th of the month, so if the cotton arrives at the port at the beginning of the month, there is no opportunity to sell it in cash, but it can still be hedged on the exchange to facilitate adjustment and benefit turnover. If the ninth item is implemented, both parties to the payment will feel inconvenienced. Because the transportation in our country is not yet fully convenient, and most of the merchants' capital relies on exchange, if the goods are stranded in the middle of the way, it is clear that they can arrive at the port at the end of the month, but they are delayed until the beginning of the month, and if they want to hedge, the current month's futures have stopped, and if they want to sell, there is no way to sell in cash. It is bound to be extended to the next month before they can hedge, and the extra losses such as warehouse rent, interest, and crushing are added. They have no choice but to ask the factory to sell it at a price that is lower than the price because the futures have stopped. In this way, cotton merchants will suffer financial losses. We would like to ask the Ministry to amend the ninth item with reference to the old practice of the US Exchange, to read "All futures for each month should be settled on the 16th of the month of expiration and may not be used for futures trading for this month. After the 16th of the month of expiration, the seller may deliver the goods at any time before the end of the month. The detailed procedures shall be drafted and approved by the Ministry of Industry to the Exchange." In short, most of the measures to combat speculation are to strictly control manipulation in order to stabilize prices, but the real amount of hedging by cotton merchants and the protection of business operations also require comprehensive planning and consideration. We are familiar with the situation and dare to contribute our humble opinions. All the reasons for the proposed revisions and the methods for combating speculation have been compiled into a document and submitted to the Ministry for your consideration of the commercial situation and approval of the revisions to benefit business operations and protect cotton merchants. We are anxiously awaiting orders. We respectfully submit this to Wu, the Minister of Industry.'</p>

<h3>Marine Engineering Association Re-negotiates to Increase Seafarers' Salaries</h3>
<p>Submits New Rules to the Ministry for Revision</p>
<p>After the China Marine Engineers Association issued the newly revised salary regulations for seafarers by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, most seafarers expressed satisfaction, but some of the articles are equivalent to a formality and do not help. In order to avoid further objections from marine engineers in the future, the association will re-submit a request to the Ministry of Communications to revise the regulations and order the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to be responsible for handling them. The requirements are as follows: ㊀ The time is too long and should be shortened. The new regulations stipulate that the captain's salary is based on 20 levels, the chief mate and second mate's salary is based on 12 levels, the third mate's salary is based on 15 levels, the chief engineer's salary is based on 14 levels, the first assistant engineer's salary is based on 10 levels, the second assistant engineer's salary is based on 12 levels, and the third assistant engineer's salary is based on 15 levels. Assuming that the Ministry allows the age of 28 as the age of each seafarer, with each level increasing every three years, the captain's highest salary will be at the age of 88, the chief mate and second mate will be at the age of 64, and the third mate will be at the age of 73. At this time, people will be dying, so how can they make a difference? Therefore, the salary should be revised to shorten the time to two years. ㊁ According to the new regulations, the salaries of the first assistant engineer and the chief mate have not increased, and the chief mate's salary has actually decreased by 20 yuan. ㊂ The salary of the captain has been increased by five levels in the new regulations, but the salary of the marine engineer has not increased. It should also be increased by two levels. ㊃ The salaries of the third assistant engineer and the third mate should exceed the salaries of the current boatswain and stoker foreman.</p>
<h3>Central Bank and Bank of Communications Agree on the Principle of Maintaining Public Debt</h3>
<p>Future Market Prices Can Be Estimated at 70% of Face Value, Arbitrage Amounts Reach 3,000 Taels in Recent Days</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred on the 8th of this month, the financial sector has been seriously affected. Public debt market prices have fallen, and small and medium-sized banks that rely on public debt and retail investors who invest in public debt to earn interest have suffered significant losses and are in danger of not being able to support themselves. The Central Bank and the Bank of Communications believe that this situation will greatly affect the market, so they are trying their best to maintain it. It is reported that after several meetings between the responsible officials of the banks and the authorities, the following principles for stabilization were formulated: ㊀ Arbitrage as much as possible to facilitate turnover. ㊀ When supply exceeds demand, buy as much as possible to maintain market prices. ㊂ The market price should be maintained at 70% of face value. If it falls further, each bank will find ways to buy in to maintain balance. Therefore, although the situation in the north has deteriorated to the extreme in recent days, the public debt market has maintenance measures, so the extent of the decline is very small. It is reported that the above-mentioned arbitrage measures have reached more than 30 million yuan in recent days, and future market prices can be maintained at 70% of face value and will not fall further, it is said.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Holds Game Fair: Lights Flicker On and Off, Female Principal Suffers Theft</h3>
<p>Dismissed Teacher Sues for False Accusation: Court Finds Principal and Tea Boy Not Guilty</p>
<p>Cantonese people Shen Junhua, Cen Kangquan, Yang Junqiu, etc., were teachers at Zhongyi Elementary School at 350 Old Baikal Road. After the summer vacation this term, Shen and the other two resigned due to disagreements with the school's principal, Cantonese woman Zhong Yunmei, and became teachers at Canghai Elementary School on Old Baikal Road. On the night of the 10th of this month, when Zhongyi Elementary School held a farewell game fair for graduating students, Shen Junhua and others also participated as directors of the drama. Unexpectedly, just as the game fair was beginning, the lights suddenly flickered and went out repeatedly. After repairs, Principal Zhong suddenly discovered that 50 yuan in legal tender, a diamond ring, and a jade ring, worth over 300 yuan, stored in her bedroom, had disappeared. Subsequently, according to a report from the electrician, the lights went out as if they had been deliberately damaged, with a copper coin secretly placed in the lamp holder. Moreover, the school's tea boy, Jiang Jintao, had witnessed Shen and others tampering with the lights. Therefore, Shen Junhua and the other two were suspected of being involved in the theft of jewelry. Principal Zhong Yunmei, accompanied by tea boy Jiang Jintao, reported the case to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered detectives to detain Shen and others for investigation before releasing them. Now, Shen Junhua, Cen Bingquan, Yang Junqiu, etc., believing that Principal Zhong Yunmei and tea boy Jiang Jintao had made false accusations, hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court's Criminal Division, requesting that the defendants be punished according to the law and, incidentally, filing a civil suit, requesting that the two defendants be jointly and severally liable for compensating the plaintiffs for reputational damages of 1,000 yuan in national currency each, totaling 3,000 yuan. The plaintiffs also requested that the two defendants publish apologies in Shanghai's major newspapers for three months and compensate the plaintiffs for two years of salary income, 25 yuan for day school and 20 yuan for night school, totaling 3,240 yuan. Principal Zhong Yunmei must also explain the situation publicly to all teachers and students at Zhongyi Elementary School to restore their reputation. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin presided over the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. The two defendants hired lawyer Zhang Shouwo to defend them. Judge Chuan reviewed the police station's report and questioned both parties. He then ordered the debate to begin, and the court found Zhong Yunmei and Jiang Jintao not guilty. The plaintiff's incidental civil suit was dismissed. It is also reported that the police station has filed a public prosecution against Shen and others, scheduled for trial on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Woman Personally Urges Husband's Family to Arrange Marriage</h3>
<p>Husband Actually Requests Termination of Engagement: Neither Party Completely Truthful</p>
<p>Chen Qingyun, 31 years old, an accountant at Lixing Sock Factory on Hu Min Nan Zhe Road in front of the District Court, lost his previous wife, Ms. Li, to illness on July 22nd of last year. Unable to bear the loneliness, he entrusted his neighbor Huang Zhang to act as a matchmaker on March 18th of this year to betroth Qu Fugeng's daughter, Meizhen (currently 26 years old, residing in a company house behind the South Railway Station), as his wife. At that time, he only wrote a letter of agreement, paying a betrothal gift of 40 yuan and a gold ring. Later, Chen fell ill for two months, so the formal engagement ceremony was not held. Therefore, Qu Meizhen, seeing that Chen was delaying the marriage, initially repeatedly urged the matchmaker to pressure him, and then the fiancée personally came to urge the marriage. Chen, facing unfortunate events and financial difficulties, promised to postpone it. However, Meizhen's desire to marry was so strong that she caused a great uproar. Chen, having never seen such a shameless fiancée, verbally requested the termination of the engagement. Upon hearing this, Meizhen was even more distraught and swallowed the gold ring to commit suicide. Chen rushed her to the Southeast Hospital for treatment, and she fortunately survived. Therefore, Chen, seeing his fiancée's temperament, wondered how they could live together until old age. He hired lawyer He Shixu to request the District Court to terminate the engagement. Yesterday, Judge Chen Pin held a hearing, and the defendant hired lawyer Ding Zhemian to appear in court, requesting compensation for reputational damages of 3,600 yuan. He claimed that after the engagement, on January 29th, Chen invited her to go dancing and opened room 517 at the Great Shanghai Hotel, registering the name "Ding." She was raped there. The second time, on February 5th, he invited her to exchange jewelry and again lured her to the Great Shanghai Hotel. On February 7th, Chen invited her to a wedding feast at the Wang family in Songjiang. At that time, because they were not yet married, she was ashamed, but she was repeatedly asked to go to Songjiang and had relations again. On March 5th, she was again taken to room 517 at the Great Shanghai Hotel and raped. Her willingness to comply was entirely due to their marital relationship. How could the engagement be terminated? The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation and instructed both parties to reconcile outside of court.</p>
<h3>Nephew Falsely Accuses Uncle of Buying Opium After Unsuccessful Loan Request</h3>
<p>Zheng Ruixing Sentenced to Four Months in Prison and Fined Eighty Yuan</p>
<p>Chaozhou businessman Zheng Ziming, who has many businesses in Shanghai and has accumulated a large fortune, has a nephew, Zheng Ruixing (36 years old), who does not engage in honest work and specializes in roaming about. He has repeatedly borrowed money from his uncle. At 10:45 a.m. the day before yesterday, Zheng Ruixing, carrying eight taels of opium, was walking along the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Henan Road when he was suddenly seen by patrolman No. 2070, who suspected his behavior. He was arrested and the opium was found. He was taken to the General Police Station, where detective Liu Qingsheng investigated. According to Zheng Ruixing, the opium was purchased at the request of his uncle Zheng Ziming. After investigation by Liu, it was found that Zheng's statement was entirely a false accusation out of resentment for the unsuccessful loan request. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the facts and requested prosecution. Judge Zhan briefly questioned the defendant and sentenced Zheng Ruixing to four months in prison and fined him eighty yuan. The opium was confiscated.</p>

<h3>Dai Peizhi Indicted for Rape of Maid</h3>
<p>Court Files Public Prosecution</p>
<p>Dai Peizhi, 32 years old, from Nanhui, a deputy buyer at Watson's, residing at 31-33 Gongyi Lane, Kulun Road, was indicted by the prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court for raping his maid, Chen Aibao (17 years old, from Shaoxing). The indictment states: "Chen Aibao is a woman under the age of sixteen, whose parents are deceased. Last year, she was employed as a servant at the defendant Dai Peizhi's home. In July, she was seduced and raped by the defendant. His wife discovered the matter and dismissed Chen Aibao. After being raped, Chen Aibao became ill and unable to work. On May 6th of this year, she saw the defendant sitting in a car parked on Fada Road and approached him to negotiate. The defendant took her to the Dongya Hotel and raped her once before she fled in fear. Chen Aibao filed a lawsuit with the court. A forensic examination proved that she was no longer a virgin. He has committed the crime under Article 227 of the Criminal Law." He was ordered to pay 1,000 yuan and provide three shop guarantees for bail. Judge Lu Hongyi held a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff hired lawyer Chen Nan to file a private suit, requesting 20 yuan per month for forty-three years, until the age of sixty, totaling 10,320 yuan. The judge questioned the plaintiff, the defendant, and the witnesses. He then adjourned the hearing to summon more witnesses. The defendant remained on his original bail.</p>

In order to reduce automobile accident cases, the Ministry of Justice has instructed that in the future, if a driver is careless and causes a fatal accident, the District Court's Prosecutor's Office should file a public prosecution for murder. It is reported that the Ministry of Justice has instructed the Chief Prosecutor of the High Court to temporarily order local District Court Prosecutors to comply.</p>
<h3>Wu Haoru Transferred to District Court Prosecutor</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Justice has ordered Wu Haoru, prosecutor of the Capital District Court, to be transferred to the Shanghai District Court as prosecutor. Wu has completed the handover in Beijing and came to Shanghai yesterday to pay respects to Chief Prosecutor Du, with a scheduled date to take office.</p>
<h3>Woman Appeals Sentence for Abusing Boy to Death</h3>
<p>Original Sentence of Twelve Years Reduced to Seven Years on Appeal</p>
<p>Ji Wang, a 39-year-old woman from Yangzhou residing at No. A10, Tongan Lane, 41 Lao Yong An Street, abused her husband Ji Longcai's adopted five-year-old boy, Ji Fuxiang. The child contracted measles at the beginning of January of this year. Instead of providing medical treatment, she subjected him to abuse and burned his legs with a hot iron, worsening his condition. He died on January 15th of this year. Neighbors, dissatisfied, reported the case to the French Police Station, which detained her and handed her over to the Second Special Court. The Police Department filed a lawsuit against her according to the law. The first instance sentenced Ji Wang to twelve years in prison. She, dissatisfied, hired lawyer Xu Wufang to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. After repeated summons, investigations, and deliberations, Ji, during the appeal period, became pregnant and was heavily ill while in custody. The court granted her permission to find bail and seek medical treatment outside. The Third Branch of the High Court has concluded the trial and issued a judgment the day before yesterday, revoking the original judgment. Ji Wang's sentence for causing death by injury was reduced to seven years of imprisonment. Because she was released on bail, she was not present at the sentencing. It is reported that she is still dissatisfied with the reduced sentence on appeal and will file a third appeal after receiving the judgment, hoping to obtain a not guilty verdict.</p>
<h3>Le Zhenbao and Others Investigated for Embezzlement with Possible Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Court to Continue Hearing This Morning</p>
<p>During the summer of last year, the Shanghai West Paint Industry Trade Association appointed Ma Shangjie as its representative to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Le Zhenbao, Bei Runsheng, Zhang Lanping, Le Gengrong, and others, directors of the Shanghai Foreign Goods Commercial Association (now renamed Renyi Shanhui), of colluding to embezzle tens of thousands of gold from the common property of nine businesses. Judge Chen Shuoying repeatedly held hearings, ordering the defendants to submit their account books for investigation. However, Le and others believed that the presiding judge was biased and applied to the Third Branch of the High Court for his recusal. The request was rejected, and Judge Chen continued the trial this spring. He ordered the defendants to submit all account books over the years for the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to review before scheduling another hearing. The case has been ongoing for a year, and the account review has been ongoing for half a year. The presiding judge, because the case has been delayed for so long, found it inconvenient to postpone it further. Therefore, he has issued summonses to the parties involved and their lawyers, scheduling the hearing to continue at 9:00 a.m. this morning in the Second Court. It is reported that a certain prominent figure has come forward to mediate a reconciliation in this case.</p>
<h3>Farmer Electrocuted</h3>
<p>Zhou Hengxiao, a 28-year-old man from Anhui, was a tenant farmer in the Hongqiao area of ​​West Shanghai. At around 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, while working in the fields, he went to cool off under the shade of a tree next to the road near the Model Middle School due to the heat. He accidentally touched a broken power line near the ground and was electrocuted, immediately losing consciousness and dying. The police saw this and tried to pull the power line away, ordering the local authorities to report the case to the District Court. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Prosecutor Wang, accompanied by inspectors, arrived at the scene to confirm the cause of death and ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>Contribution of the Industrial World in Times of Emergency</h3>
<p>—Yang An</p>
<p>Our country has recently entered a time of emergency. The various Chinese goods factories that contribute their strength to the country are as important as the frontline soldiers fighting the enemy. What are we currently preparing? Have we thought about how we will serve if a full-scale war begins? How can we start our work to be loyal to the country? There are too many things we should do.</p>
<p>First, we must concentrate our strength, manpower, and resources. The training of technical talents, the collection and preservation of raw materials are all necessary tasks today. All specialists, such as miners, technicians, chemists, machinists, engineers, and all industrialists in factories, should do their best to serve the motherland, resist aggression, and save the nation. Special research and manufacturing, such as the manufacture of munitions and armaments, the transformation of existing machinery, military supplies, fuel conservation, increased food production, chemical refining, and substitutes for food, fuel, and feed, all rely on the heart and soul of industrialists to serve the country. The inventions of German experts during the European War, such as substitutes for food, feed, and gasoline, can serve as proof.</p>
<p>Secondly, for non-urgent manufacturing and industries that are not directly related to construction, production quotas should be set and working hours should be reduced to save fuel for military needs. During the European War, the United States reduced the production of machinery, rock candy, fruit, stone tools, bricks, tiles, and glass industries by 15% to 50%. Chinese goods factories, in this time of crisis, should prepare in advance to deal with emergencies.</p>
<h3>National Crisis Intensifies: New Efforts Needed from the Chinese Goods Industry</h3>
<p>—Xuan Wan</p>
<p>In the past few days, the situation in North China has become more tense day by day. The enemy's relentless pressure and inch-by-inch advances have brought our entire nation to the point of unbearable endurance. Especially since the publication of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech, declaring the Lugouqiao Incident as the final moment for our nation's resolute sacrifice and demonstrating the government's determination to fight, the enthusiasm of the national people to support the leader in resisting the enemy has become even stronger. Our Chinese goods manufacturers, at this final moment of national life and death, must naturally make more active preparations and strive for new and urgent work to welcome the arrival of this extraordinary period!</p>
<p>We know that in the future process of resistance, whether the front-line combat can be sustained and victorious depends entirely on whether the rear supply is sufficient. And whether our national industry can become a strong support for the government, break free from all external shackles, and achieve full independent development naturally lies at this moment. Therefore, at present, whether it is to save the endangered nation or to develop a better future for our national industry, every employee of our Chinese goods manufacturers should work together towards this goal. Now I dare to list four points that our Chinese goods industry should strengthen its efforts in, for everyone's attention and implementation:</p>
<p>First, we must intensify our efforts in the movement to not buy or sell smuggled goods and promote Chinese goods. If necessary, we should also petition the government to sever economic ties with the enemy, because this can directly strengthen our economic national defense, and indirectly it can weaken the enemy's resources and increase our strength to resist the war.</p>
<p>Second, we must make a firm determination to completely contribute our strength to the country. During the war, we must ensure that Chinese manufacturers who can convert to military supplies strive to manufacture various military supplies. At the same time, all our food manufacturing factories must intensify production to supply the urgent needs of the front and rear lines. Furthermore, we should supply all the remaining scrap copper and iron to the country.</p>
<p>Third, we must immediately concentrate financial, material, and human resources to prepare for emergencies. For example, we should have a comprehensive plan for the current preparation of financial resources in factories, the estimation of raw materials, materials, and fuel, and the recruitment of technical talents, so that we can deal with the enemy for a long time!</p>
<p>Fourth, we must intensify military training. Now that the leaders of our Chinese goods industry have automatically organized special training teams, we ordinary workers should of course intensify military training to be ready for the country to drive us in the future and go to the national crisis together!</p>
<h3>Promoting National Goods Verbally</h3>
<p>—Du Yun</p>
<p>There is a saying: "One word can make a country prosper, and one word can make a country perish." There is also a saying in colloquial language: "Verbal hidden alms, verbal merit." This shows that the relationship between words, in and out, is very important. I think that verbally promoting national goods also has a great effect.</p>
<p>Recently, a new type of white soap has been found on the market, with aggressive advertisements. The price per bar is one copper cheaper than Gu Ben. One day, I saw a certain resident who lived with me using that soap to wash clothes. I told her, why don't you use Gu Ben soap? Do you want to be cheap for one copper? You should know that Gu Ben soap is our Chinese product, pure in quality, easy to remove dirt, and does not damage clothes. This is the experience of tens of millions of households! After listening to me, she did change to using Gu Ben soap, and my verbal promotion of national goods was successful. A few days ago, the neighbors next door went to buy soda, and bought a × Fang brand, the price was really cheap, only six corners a dozen. I said to him: Why did you buy this brand? This is a genuine ×× product. It's better to change to 'Yi Li' 'Watson's' 'Lao De Ji' brand. Although they are more expensive, they are all national products! After listening to me, he changed to drinking domestic soda, and my verbal promotion of national goods was successful again. My neighbor suffers from mosquitoes and wanted to buy mosquito coils, so I told him to buy 'Samsung Mosquito Coils.' If you want to buy a T-shirt, I told him that 'Goose Brand' is very good. Among colleagues, friends, relatives, and neighbors, if they purchase goods and they inquire with me, I will introduce the national brand to them. Or when I see them buying, I point out the brand of national goods and ask them to buy it. If I see that they have bought non-national goods, I will tell them that it is best to change to using national goods next time. Everyone loves the country as much as I do. Some people really don't know the brands of national goods. If you introduce them to national goods verbally, it is really easy to be effective.</p>
<p>Finally, to practice promoting national goods verbally, then you must first be accustomed to using national goods yourself, be able to say the brands of national goods for various applications, and be able to recite them like a family treasure. Then, you can conveniently say in words, such promotion of national goods is 'heart and mouth attached'!</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Foreign Goods Passing Off as Domestic Goods, and Domestic Goods Altered to Pass Off as Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>— Guo Xiushi</p>
<p>In these times of enthusiastic promotion of domestic goods, one often hears of unscrupulous merchants without conscience altering foreign goods to pass them off as domestic goods, deceiving our fellow countrymen. This is truly heartbreaking! However, it is a matter of pure coincidence that, in fact, it is precisely because of the general mindset of many Chinese people who still prefer foreign goods, even if domestic goods are of the same quality or even superior, that they still believe only foreign goods are trustworthy. Consequently, there are also a few domestic goods manufacturers who, to cater to the Chinese mindset, willingly sign contracts with foreign merchants, labeling their products with foreign brands and having them distributed by foreign firms, presenting them as imported goods. This is truly lamentable! One day, I happened to be discussing this fact with my friend Mr. Shen, who told me that on ×× Road, there is a gas and oil lamp factory established by Chinese people themselves, but their products are entirely labeled with the brand of ×× Foreign Firm and exclusively managed and sold to Chinese people by ×× Foreign Firm. It is said that when they initially started with their own brand, they struggled to gain the trust of the Chinese people, but after switching to the foreign brand, not only did the quality of the goods remain the same, but sales immediately flourished.</p>
<p>Domestic goods altered to pass off as foreign goods and counterfeit foreign goods passing off as domestic goods both result from the general unscrupulousness of merchants abandoning their conscience and losing their business ethics, deeply burying the status of domestic goods and handing over the prospects of domestic goods to foreign goods for suppression. Perhaps this is not a coincidence. Therefore, I am writing this specifically in the hope that our domestic goods industry and enthusiastic readers who promote domestic goods will take note and not allow these unscrupulous merchants who have lost their minds to harm the prospects of the majority of genuine domestic goods.</p>
<h3>My Opinion on Adding a 'National Defense Donation' to the Sale of Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Anyone who understands the trend of the current situation knows that the survival of the Chinese nation has reached a 'final critical moment'!</p>
<p>The call for resisting the enemy and saving the nation, and for extraordinary preparation, is spreading throughout the country and reaching overseas Chinese, stimulating the hearts of every great Chinese national!</p>
<p>There are various methods for extraordinary preparation to save the country. Intensifying the domestic goods movement and implementing economic self-defense to aid our military self-defense, advancing in concert, is truly the best method to overcome national difficulties, resist the enemy, and save the nation. It makes the enemy's industrial products encounter obstacles everywhere in our country! The well-organized lineup of domestic goods is the same as Yucheng in North China! In this extraordinary period, I believe that domestic goods markets should lower profit margins on the sales prices of domestic goods and add a permanent 'national defense donation' of five percent to the invoices, stamped with a highly visible and meaningful mark, or even simply recording President Chiang Kai-shek's proclaimed national policy, so that customers are constantly vigilant!</p>
<p>Thinking of this constantly, the addition of the 'national defense donation' will be gladly accepted without any objection. Like Bu Shi defending the border, it is an inescapable duty. As for the organizations selling domestic goods, reducing profit margins and joining hands with customers to shoulder the mission and responsibility of saving the nation is of course a welcome thing!</p>
<p>Every bit of the 'national defense donation' must be strictly managed, with every drop going to public use, contributing to the concentration of the country's economic strength. Then, with everyone lifting together, it will be easy, and the economic self-defense of military support will become even more effective! Compared to a tangible war, an intangible war is even better! 'To know shame is near to courage'! Economic salvation and saving the nation with domestic goods is the need of the hour!</p>
<h3>My Little Contribution</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>The surge in promoting domestic goods is directly proportional to the rising tide of national anti-enemy sentiment. In other words, promoting domestic goods today is not narrowly about expanding the sales market for domestic goods, but rather a branch of resisting the enemy and saving the nation. Knowledgeable people in society see this very clearly. Therefore, everyone has the concept of 'whether it is a domestic product' when purchasing goods. However, unscrupulous elements often take advantage of our enthusiasm for using domestic goods, altering inferior goods and imitating the appearance of domestic goods. Recently, some friends told me that they had fallen for such a trick. Because of patriotism, holding the belief that 'Chinese people should use Chinese goods,' they ended up buying counterfeit goods and felt very uneasy. Now, I have thought of a remedy: in addition to domestic goods manufacturers constantly paying attention to counterfeit goods and publicly reporting them, there is also the publication of joint 'domestic goods advertisements.' These domestic goods advertisements are different from the joint domestic goods advertisements previously published in newspapers. My opinion is that goods of the same name or nature should be published together, publishing 'fire industry' today and 'thermos bottles' tomorrow, rotating the publications daily. These domestic goods advertisements must specify the trademark of the goods (revealing the graphic history), the manufacturer and location of production. I hope that organizations promoting domestic goods and the Joint Association should come forward to advocate this. The advertising fee is cheap, and the effect is greater than ordinary advertisements, so various manufacturers will definitely be willing to do so, and people who buy and use domestic goods will no longer be deceived by inferior goods. People with good intentions, please try it!</p>
<h3>The Anti-Enemy Movement in the Domestic Goods Industry</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the situation in North China has suddenly become unusually critical. The loyal and brave soldiers at the front, holding the generous and passionate attitude of 'rather be a shattered jade than an intact tile,' vow to fight against the enemy and sacrifice for the country, swearing to resist the enemy to the death. The enthusiasm of the military is truly worthy of the excitement of patriotic compatriots throughout the country.</p>
<p>Now, all sectors of the country are gathering and discussing effective assistance methods to support the loyal and brave soldiers defending the country at the front. This is a great work of great value and significance. As a member of the domestic goods industry, I would also like to contribute a few simple and foolish opinions, hoping that influential figures in the domestic goods industry will promptly advocate and implement them quickly to prepare for the arrival of this urgent and critical extraordinary period.</p>
<p>㊀ Donate funds for慰劳: Judging from the current situation, the great war in North China is about to break out and will definitely not be resolved in a short period. The purchase of all military supplies requires a large amount of money. At this time, various national organizations should lead various domestic goods factories to donate funds according to their ability and remit them to the front for various needs. However, it must be noted that strict organizations should be established so that ordinary shameless people cannot use the opportunity to take advantage of the situation for personal gain, causing them to be criticized by newspapers, involved in lawsuits in public courts, losing the trust of the public, and fostering a climate of cunning. This should be fully prevented in advance. According to my humble opinion, this matter can be presided over by reputable organizations in the domestic goods industry, and the results will definitely be remarkable.</p>
<p>㊁ Strive for Production: All service personnel in the domestic goods industry should clearly recognize their goals at this critical moment, strive for production, sweep away the previous passive and decadent bad habits, invigorate their spirits, and intensify their work. For example, an alcohol factory that usually ships 2,000 gallons should intensify its work from now on and increase its production volume to store the surplus for national use. Other industries, such as cotton textile industry, machinery industry, chemical industry, etc., should also find ways to increase production in preparation for use in times of crisis.</p>
<p>㊂ Strict Inspection of Smuggling: The issue of smuggling has recently become more and more serious. The rampant smuggling is truly threatening the national industry of our country. At this extraordinary time, domestic goods producers, vendors, and consumers should not only swear not to buy or sell smuggled goods, but also practically implement smuggling inspection work to ensure that smuggled goods disappear from the markets of our country. It must be known that strict inspection of smuggling can not only prevent the enemy's economic invasion methods from being used, but also consolidate the lifeline of our national economy.</p>
<p>㊃ Extraordinary Preparation: In this critical extraordinary period, compatriots throughout the country should have a preparation for an extraordinary period. Domestic goods producers should truly recognize that when the First World War broke out, the industries and businesses of various countries all transformed into military supply agencies, helping the government's foreign wars and making great contributions.</p>
<p>Therefore, I sincerely hope that the domestic goods industry throughout the country should intensify preparations in this extraordinary period and study the manufacture of wartime supplies, such as paint factories researching and manufacturing gunpowder, food companies storing more canned food, etc., all of which are preparations that should be made in an extraordinary period. In short, the time has truly come when 'the enemy is deep and the matter is urgent'. Gentlemen of the domestic loan industry, quickly rise up.</p>
<h3>The Domestic Goods Industry in a Week</h3>
<p>▲ China National Domestic Products Joint Operation Corporation invites leaders of domestic goods factories in three batches to discuss cooperation methods between local domestic goods companies and factories.</p>
<p>▲ The total amount of the domestic loan syndicate organized by China National Domestic Products Joint Operation Corporation and Shanghai banks is 3 million yuan, which has been determined by each bank.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai China National Domestic Products Company has raised a sufficient share capital of 400,000 yuan. It held an increase in capital shareholders' meeting on July 25 and elected Zhang Zhuyu and Cheng Zhiyi as Xiao, and Zhou Yichun as supervisor.</p>
<p>▲ After the reorganization of Qingdao National Domestic Products Company, it is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting on August 1. Cai Shengbai, Fang Yexian, and Fang Jiange, representatives of the National Domestic Products Joint Operation Corporation, flew to Qingdao on the 30th to attend.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou China National Domestic Products Company has raised a sufficient share capital of 200,000 yuan and held a founders' meeting on the 22nd.</p>
<p>▲ Guangzhou China National Domestic Loan Company is scheduled to hold a reorganized inaugural meeting on August 15.</p>

<h3>Various Strange Occurrences</h3>
<p>— Jingguan</p>
<p>The book-collecting clerk at the Japanese Consulate in Nanjing once went missing. Once he went missing, he was promoted to become a vice-consul, and the world was thrown into great chaos. This play, with loud gongs and drums, started with a full martial arts scene, but ended with a comedy. This time, the cause of the Lugouqiao Incident was also because a Japanese soldier went missing. Although General Song Zheyuan returned to Beiping from Tianjin and opened the city gates wide, sincerely expressing his desire for peace, there was no way to prevent the Japanese army from attacking, and finally he had to close the city gates again. Who knew that this matter was not over yet, and a brave warrior was missing from the Japanese military camp in Shanghai. The good show of "January 28th" seemed to have the intention of being re-staged once again.</p>
<p>People all over the world are wondering, "How come the Japanese have gone missing again?"</p>
<p>In fact, this is not surprising. What is strange is that a country good at going missing has encountered our nation that loves peace, so strange things have increased.</p>
<p>Looking at today's (July 27) newspaper, the Japanese army has already opened fire on Beiping. In advance, it was said that more than 500 Japanese troops from Oimurayama were divided into more than 40 trucks and concentrated north of the Caishen Temple outside Guang'anmen; 150 of them even shouted to open Guangpingmen at 7:30 pm on the 26th and swaggered into the city. As soon as they entered the city, they fired their guns in the cars. Although it was quickly closed, the artillery outside followed with bombardment.</p>
<p>What is even stranger is that the Japanese army fears us like tigers——"According to Westerners who came to Shanghai...the bravery of the 29th Army in combat is admirable....During the fierce battle at Lugouqiao, there were two occasions when the Chinese soldiers charged forward and could have reached Tongzhou on one side and Fengtai on the other...The Japanese army feared the 29th Army like tigers, and many deserted on the battlefield when fighting" (see July 26 "Da Wan Bao").</p>
<p>Since "the Japanese fear our army like tigers," why does the newspaper always report news of the Japanese army attacking us?</p>
<p>People provoke a dispute and protest against us instead. These things are incomprehensible no matter how you think about them.</p>

<h3>Contributions to the Current Work of Saving the Nation</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>㊀ Understanding of the Current Situation</p>
<p>㊀ The Lugouqiao Incident was the beginning of a new large-scale offensive by the enemy against China. The crisis in North China is imminent. It is not enough to protect Beiping without immediately resisting the war, let alone protect the endangered North China. This war of resistance will be the starting point for the liberation of the entire Chinese nation from more than a hundred years of slavery and humiliation. China will surely achieve the final victory, and Japanese imperialism will inevitably be driven out of our territory.</p>
<p>㊁ President Chiang Kai-shek declared: "The evolution of the Lugouqiao Incident is related to the entire issue of the Chinese state. Whether this matter can be ended is the realm of the final critical moment." This is the clearest and most unequivocal recognition and expression of the current situation by our country's highest authority. He also said: "The most important thing for the national citizens is to recognize the meaning of the so-called final critical moment. Once the final critical moment arrives, we can only sacrifice to the end and resist to the end. Only with the determination to sacrifice to the end can we win the final victory. If we hesitate and blindly seek temporary safety, we will plunge the nation into an abyss of eternal doom." He also said: "As for after the war has begun, it is because we are a weak country, and there is no longer any opportunity for compromise. If we give up an inch of land and sovereignty, we will be the eternal sinners of the Chinese nation. At that time, we can only risk the life of the nation to seek our final victory." This is our country's highest authority's firm expression and admonition to all our national citizens regarding the current situation. All the people should support President Chiang Kai-shek's firm and clear declaration with the greatest enthusiasm. All the people of the country should place the greatest confidence in President Chiang Kai-shek, believing that President Chiang Kai-shek will be able to make what he said become our country's firm and unswerving national policy based on his great personality and patriotism. What we can now clearly recognize is that the "final moment of sacrifice" has arrived, and "the whole people can only fight to the death to seek the final victory"!</p>
<p>㊂ The war of resistance against foreign aggression should be carried out under unified command. Any different opinions and factions should unite and unite under the determination to sacrifice to the end in the war against foreign aggression. The national army should be placed under the command of the entire operational strategy in terms of strategy. The work of saving the nation by the people should be under the leadership of the government. Every enthusiastic worker who is dedicated to the work of saving the nation today should resolutely vow to launch his actions under the enthusiastic support of the government's strategy of resisting foreign aggression. There should absolutely not be even the slightest opposition between the people and the government. The government should lead the people, organize the people, and the people should trust that the government will definitely be tough on foreign aggression to the end, and use the enthusiastic support of the people to further strengthen the government's determination to fight against foreign aggression.</p>
<p>㊁ What We Should Do Now</p>
<p>A. Demands on the Government</p>
<p>㊀ Sino-Japanese negotiations should be resolved under the central government, and any resolution under the pretext of local incidents should be opposed. The responsibility for the Lugouqiao Incident lies entirely with the Japanese side. If there are negotiations, they should begin with the automatic withdrawal of the Japanese army. However, they have been bombarding Wanping City for days, and it can be seen that there is absolutely no sincerity for peace.</p>
<p>㊁ Immediately transfer large troops to the north to reinforce the 29th Army, and never withdraw a step from Lugouqiao. All troops in Chahar, Suiyuan, Shaanxi and Gansu should concentrate on Beiping. If necessary, launch a full-scale war.</p>
<p>㊂ 民衆救亡團體，行動，救亡言論(賒關軍事秘密外)，應盡量開放，一切擁護政府對外抗戰民衆的言行，應予保護與領導。We know that the strength of the people is the government's most powerful backing. China's war of resistance against foreign aggression is not solely dependent on military strength. The anger and determination of all the people is the only condition for achieving the final victory. Therefore, if there is no determination to resist foreign aggression, then it is over. Otherwise, the government can only fight to the death with the enemy if the people unite and support the central government. This is the characteristic and advantage of all national liberation wars in colonial and semi-colonial areas.</p>
<p>B. Front Line and Rear</p>
<p>Now, the 29th Army's war of resistance against foreign aggression has taken shape. In order to make this war of resistance persist and expand, there are many things we should do immediately on the front line and in the rear:</p>
<p>㊀ Organize a慰劳 team. The 29th Army is fighting hard on the front line. The people in the rear have been constantly encouraging them spiritually and materially. However, there is still one thing that can be done, that is, organizing a慰劳 team in various places to go to the front line to directly give our army慰劳 and encouragement. The work of this 慰劳 team can be divided into many categories, such as a rescue team, which can be organized within it, that is, 会务 in the war zone: a singing team, to encourage the soldiers' spirits, and the transportation of慰劳 items.</p>
<p>㊁ Launch a wider fundraising campaign to present to the government and the soldiers on the front line.</p>
<p>㊂ Organize a propaganda team to go to nearby villages to publicize the crisis of this enemy attack and the government's determination to resist the war. Perform anti-Japanese dramas and spread songs of saving the nation.</p>
<p>㊃ Recruit a rescue team. When the war breaks out, there will be many casualties. Rescue work should be prepared as soon as possible. Knowledge of air defense and poison gas should also be trained quickly. A rescue team should be recruited quickly, and the general public should be called upon to join.</p>
<p>㊄ Recruit a volunteer team. When the war begins, the main force in the war cannot rely entirely on the regular army. The people have the necessity and obligation to go to the front line. At this time, preparations should begin, and a large number of citizens should be recruited to participate in the volunteer team. The citizen training currently being held by the government can serve as the backbone of the volunteer team. Start recruiting immediately so that it can be dispatched when necessary.</p>
<p>What I have thought of is briefly listed above. There is a lot of other work that can be carried out in all aspects, but there is one center: strive to promote the realization of the war of resistance, support the government's strong stance against foreign aggression, and all work should be organically applied from this center.</p>
<p>㊂ Concrete Implementation</p>
<p>㊀ Business circles, students, workers, freelancers, fellow villagers' associations, and all organizations should automatically join a general organization and engage in saving the nation by doing their most suitable work. The business circles unite the merchants, and the students organize the students. There is no need to seek a large scope. Three or four people can initiate a call, and after the small groups are established, they can be combined into a large organization according to their nature.</p>
<p>㊁ All actions should be held under the premise of publicly and enthusiastically supporting the government, and should seek the guidance of the authorities, and should do as much as possible to eliminate unnecessary misunderstandings from the outside world, purely for the sake of saving the country, and against all激烈的轨外 actions.</p>
<p>㊂ The already established Anti-Enemy Support Association should try to attract all patriotic people to gather in the organization.</p>
