<h3>德王的野心（四）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者錢筆</p>
<p>大部份蒙人都有深切覺悟　察境旗民紛紛流亡到外蒙</p>
<p>㊄訪石王夫人</p>
<p>蒙古民族的文化雖然落後，但是他們的智慧却超出尋常之上，尤其是堅苦耐勞的强健體魄，和百折不撓的精神，眞值得我們欽佩贊揚，因為困苦環境的壓迫，使他們的天才，受着許多束縛，無從發展，於是在某一個時代裏，就會突然產生出非常偉大的人物來，這就是時勢造英雄的意義。記者在綏遠和許多位蒙古王公會談。他們誠懇的態度，謙和的談吐，聰明的思想，都留下一種極良好的印象，可惜沒有機會和德王見面，否則一定可以聽他講出一篇大理來。那時在綏遠的有位康王，是伊克昭盟達拉特旗的札薩克，姓名全文呌康達多爾濟，也是一位聰明絕頂的人物，他能自己駕駛汽車，又有修理各種機械的本領。他帶着最新式的康脫福來克的反光鏡箱，很和氣的隨便替人家拍照。據他說他生平最喜歡玩照相，大小新舊照相機家裏陳列着好幾十架，眞有意思。過去察綏蒙旗分裂的導火綫就是所謂西公旗事件。西公旗的石王最初與盟長雲王不睦，這本來與德王不相干的，後來石王因他的前夫人和石王的部下曼圖有染，把曼圖驅逐出境，曼圖投奔到德王手下包悅卿那裏，包委他在石王的轄境內做一名卡長，石王大怒，認為有意侮辱，就向蒙政會告發，德王當時頗想把曼圖懲辦，因召石王對質，石王却誤認德王對他不利，竟抗命不赴百靈廟，雙方誤會日深，後來雖經各方調停，石王前夫人亦服毒自殺，表面上固然告一段落，實際就因此發生了一條很深的裂痕。現在石王也死了，又有所謂繼承問題的糾紛。原來石王前夫人自殺後，現在的夫人就是在蒙旗中很著名的石奇俊峯女士，現已懷孕八個月，石王死後無子不能襲位，旗內分兩派爭代理札薩克權，結果由綏當局設法調停解决，卽由兩派首領薩克都爾札布，色令布分任恊理，由薩護理札薩克職，如石夫人生子，按例可為記名札薩克，十八歲始可正式襲王位。就因為這件繼承問題，石王夫人石奇俊峯女士勾留在綏遠達數月之久。這位夫人歸石王不久，是伊克昭盟的達拉特旗人，達旗以出美人著名，石王夫人年祇二十四歲，也出落得十分清秀。蒙古人的騎馬本領本是不弱，石王夫人更為個中好手，能兩手開槍，命中率極强，近年隨着石王帶領軍隊剿匪，立下許多功勞眞是位巾幗英雄。她在綏遠住綏新飯店，記者到綏的第二天就去訪問，她住的是上房，三大間侍衛副官們分住廂房數間，先和副官談一會兒，就引記者到上房，房中隔着白幔，石王夫人穿着孝服旗袍，很謙和地連聲請坐。她同她的母親同居，操着很純熟的北平話，說她幼年時在平女子中學求學，家住北平後門，所以一切生活已是漢化了。她說話非常坦白，談到馳馬殺賊的時候，滔滔不絕，眉飛色舞，說她騎馬開槍是家傳的玩意兒，蒙古女子都會兩手，實在不足為奇；又談到漢蒙一家，蒙古建設等問題，都很有識見。臨行，請她照一張相，很大方的應允了，站在廊前，說這裏光綫很好，請照罷。記者十分滿意地辭了出來，而蒙古問題因此更盤旋在腦際，一刻不能去懷。（完）</p>

<h3>歐美和日本對華認識的不同及其影響</h3>
<p>— 吳世昌</p>
<p>“調整中日國交”“中日提携合作”的呼聲，近來又嚷得洋洋盈耳了。日本的外交政策和朝野舆論，近來對華的態度也屢經改變，雖然其論調總不外乎對華侵略上緩進和急進的分別而已。態度，論調，當然要基於觀察，認識，而近來彼邦朝野人士外交上主張頻易，可見得他們此刻對華的認識尚未確立，以前的認識在動搖修改之中。如果能趁這個機會根本一反從前所為，先恢復“九一八”以前的國際常態再談提携合作，那眞是東亞和世界之福。但我們看了南北走私的猖獗，毒物的湧進，冀察政權的異常等等，覺得前途還很渺茫，日人受以前對華錯誤認識之害畢竟太深！日人常常奇怪，為什麼中國留學歐美的學生對曾經留學的國家都有好感，而留日的學生則反是？為什麼中國人對異文異種的歐美人這樣歡迎合作，對同文同種的日本人反而避之惟恐不及？這都是由於認識上的不同，國策態度亦隨之改變，而中國對各國的反應，也就大異其趣了。</p>
<p>本來日本是中國的兄弟，它的文化完全是從中國分過去的，它脫離中國這母體以後能够獨立，並且這六十年來知道學得西洋人的技能，很可為黃色人種爭光。說到對中國的認識，不論在性格上，在文化上它都應該比西洋人更正確無誤，然而事實却適得其反。西洋人並不十分了解中國人和中國文化，但他們相信人與人之間相處，有幾條共同的原則是必須遵守的。東西的道德觀念儘可不同，但是和平或殘暴，守信或無賴，誠實或奸詐，利人益己或損人不利己，却是從原始民族到最文明的社會都能了解，都知趨避的事。西洋的工商業國家在外經營殖民地及通商，在十七世紀前後都是些海盜政策，但如果要維持永久的商利，他們知道不能常做海盜，不能不做規矩的商人；個人的行為如此，國家的政策也如此。中國進步，他們的觀察和態度也隨之進步，一世紀前可以為鴉片的買賣和中國宣戰，現在决不做這樣無恥的勾當了。五卅時代還是暴戾橫蠻的政策，但等到中國的民衆起來爭自由平等，推翻腐敗的北洋軍閥時，張伯倫內閣立卽批准了“陳奧恊定”把漢口——後來又把九江——租界退回了中國。他們知道庚子之役仇殺外僑並不是中國人民的本意，只是少數暴民的盲動，而把此後每年鉅額的賠欵壓在中國人民的肩上是不合理的，所以他們自動的放棄，把這錢仍舊用在發展中國的文化事業上。他們相信只要中國進步繁榮，他們的海外商業自然發達，同受利益，所以他們眞心帮助中國，眞心希望中國富强安定。事實上他們所退回的庚欵，早就在商業方面賺回去了。對於中國文化的了解，對於中國人性格的認識，西洋人並不十分透澈，而且往往很可笑，小的地方尤其糊塗；但只要能識大體，這些小節無妨於外交大計。而西洋人對華的認識，是能識大體的。</p>
<p>回頭來看日本，却使我們得到完全相反的現象，這是很可痛心的。對於中國文化的認識日本當然比歐美深澈——中國許多古文化還保存在日本，而對中國人性格的了解，卽使不來中國，自己照照鏡子也會比歐美人清楚得多。但是可怪的是他們對於中國政治上的觀察，永久向最壞的方面下注解，永遠不肯承認中國的優點和進步，（除非歐美人已經再四承認以後，他們跟在後面附和幾聲。）加於中國的種種惡名，如“無組織的國家”啦，“華北人民運動脫離中央”啦，無不從中國的東方傳來；中國政治上不幸有糾紛，最壞的揣測都從我們同文同種的報紙宣傳開去。而尤其可痛心的是：以前每次中國內亂總有他們從中操縱或鼓勵，他們不願見中國有强有力的中央政府，北伐軍到山東便打北伐軍，張作霖出國便炸張作霖。對於中國人民的心理，他們專好研究下層階級，北平的天橋，天津的三不管等處，他們都有大學畢業生派在那裏研究，不論匪黨的組織，各行的黑語，他們研究得比中國人自己還清楚。因此他們有許多的“支那通”，這些“支那通”都很自負對於中國人的心理了解很深刻。殊不知下層階級各國都有，他們的心理正是一國內亟待敎育改正的病態，執此以為一國人民的常態是很錯誤很危險的。見小部份的病態而不識大體上的常態，正是孟子所謂“明察秋毫而不能見輿薪！”</p>
<p>由於彼邦“支那通”的不健全的智識，再加上島國特有的性格，恰巧逢着中國被前清政府弄得貧弱異常還未能翻身的不幸現象，遂使日本對華的政策惡劣不堪，造成兩國間的許多苦痛，將來的結果還不知道誰的苦痛更大。日本若眞想調整兩國的關係，使東亞兩大國提携合作，第一步先要改正對華認識的心理，一反以前的觀念，從大體上了解中國人民的意旨。而此刻中國人民最普遍堅强的意旨是：必須恢復中國失去的領土權，可以用善意恢復則用善意　　　　　　　　　用鐵血！</p>

<h3>成渝路的風景綫</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>四川景物奇秀，出產豐美，值得參觀的地方，的確不勝其數。灌縣的都江堰，水利雄冠全國；富順的自流井，能天然出鹽水與出火，更是點綴“天府之國”的特色。有人說：“不曾遊過峨眉，不算到過四川。”我却以為：“不曾看過都江堰和自流井，縱然遊過峨眉山，也不算到過四川。”理由很簡單：“峨眉天下秀”，雖是一句老話，在事實上，天下山水，够得上稱“出類拔萃”之秀的，豈僅峨眉一處？唯有那都江堰和自流井，特別是自流井，眞找不到第二處。而且，自流井每年能產二百八十萬担以上的鹽，都江堰灌溉普及於十四縣的水利，在四川公私經濟的意義上，眞是一大生命綫啊！所以我說：“不曾看過都江堰和自流井，算不得到過四川。”</p>
<p>都江堰在成都的北方，乘汽車一日可達。自流井在成都的南方，從成渝路乘汽車先到內江，恰一整天，第二日再坐“滑杆”一百三十里才到。趁伴先看自流井，故先舍近而求遠。</p>
<p>成渝路是四川公路的鼻祖，已有二十多年的歷史，路綫很長，起站終站，既是成都重慶兩大都市，而中途亦多繁華縣鎮，所以營業很發達。每日對開班車各四五輛，以內江為宿夜中站，隔日可互到目的地。乘客須按先來後到的次序，領取應乘車位的牌號，再候鈴要響始買票上車。手續與京滬大醫院掛號類似，故秩序還算維持得可以，雖然多了一道掛號的麻煩。</p>
<p>車先在成都壩子駛了一大程，處處綠野平疇、風和日麗，經過不少的大小村鎮，常見許多服裝不整齊的壯丁，一排排地站在農閒時的打穀塲上，“一二三”“一二三”地操着預備放的姿式。大概是想避免晨曦的刺眼，槍口一致正對着北方瞄準。</p>
<p>行經龍泉驛山，嶺脈縱橫高峻，路綫曲折紆迴，彷彿西蘭路的六盤山，浙閩路的仙霞嶺，司機乘客，無不深存戒心。據京來往的某商說：“最險峻的地方，還不曾發生過意外事；比較容易開駛的地方，尤其是翻過高嶺，快要到達平地的時候，反有時會發生不幸的事件。”這到是“生於憂患，死於安樂”的哲理的一個實證。汽車駛達高嶺，舉目四望，山地雜㮔着红白甘薯，正值收掘之期，纍纍然堆置地角。煞似金銀。較低平之處，甚至到了水田區域，還有尚未收穫的甘蔗，上梢碧綠如春秧，下部褐黃似秋栗；再雜花地生長着些橘林，黃果，佛手柑，山青菜，油菜花，肥嫩的豆麥，都非常引起人的美感。若在黃河以北，冬至節前後，一切蔬菜水果，都要珍藏在地窖中，不然便要凍壞。可是在四川，雖已時屆殘冬，大地還不輕易脫卸她的美麗的綠色外衣，如此溫和的氣候，肥美的土質，是多麼令人可愛呀！</p>
<p>下坡後首次經過的縣城叫簡陽，城墻拆後又復造好，這是緣於先欲便利交通，繼要防範“赤匪”之故。隨後到了資陽縣境一個山迴路轉的去處，有一方人工剖去的削岩上，大書着幾個復興國族的標語，其中有－個是一勦匪不忘抗×”，已經被人塗上了一層白粉。資中縣城，靠山臨水，風景清幽，與上游的簡陽，下游的內江，同是沱江流域“如在畫中”的繁華都市。</p>
<p>資中中學學生，在車站上執冊募捐，先散來一張“慰勞綏東前敵將士募捐啟”，內有“綏東不失，國家不亡”。“綏東將士有救，綏東才有救”。“學生等除節食捐助外，爰向各界愛國人士募捐”等語。他們的態度極誠懇，言語極動人。於是風塵僕僕的行人，大多數踴躍捐助。同車中有不識字的婦人，聽明情由，也請旁人代筆，慨然解囊。有一位胸懸徽章的公務員，并在捐冊上批數字：“請彙集直匯綏東傅作義將軍，切勿由其他中間機關轉手。千萬千萬（意卽務請辦到）”！記者請敎原故，才知道成都前曾募過一度的愛國捐，共計二萬餘元，彙父某機關後，便被扣用了。捐欵人雖然不願意，可是也無可奈何。以故，此次募捐，大家要求直匯前方。</p>
<p>晚到內江，天色突然陰暗，街上的電燈，已經放亮。崢嶸起伏的四山，婉轉抱城的清流，在灰色的暮烟籠罩中，更烘托成一幅深秀清幽的美畫。沱江蜿蜒境內，濃度甚大，往往十幾里的陸行，舟行一日，還難畢其程。李璞的“山行依舊合，水去復還來”；和李白的“青山橫北郭，白水繞東城”的名句，卽為此間城市風景寫照。</p>
<p>飯後出旅館巡禮，路人往來如鯽。商肆在輝煌的燈光下，多數還開着夜市。千里跋涉的轎夫挑夫們，也正不斷地向掛着“高人下馬”紅紙燈籠的客棧去投宿。川省現已實行分期禁烟，定於民國二十六年份，種烟縣份减至僅有四縣，至三十年禁絕。內江設有公膏店，此刻正當一般黑籍人民，向他們“納貢”的時候，生意之興隆，還過於設在附近一間寺廟裏的電影院。茶舖酒館，和成都同樣的多。每家壁上都貼有“莫談國事”的標語，這是十分惹眼的。</p>

<p>本年二月十四日奧國總理許希尼格博士對祖國陣綫領袖發了許多言論，這回演說，表面雖覺得激昂慷慨，但骨裏却伏着一椿他個人犧牲的沉痛事件，因為奧國報紙不載一字，所以除了貴族之外，奧國人是很少知道的。就是世界上的一般人士，也决不料這位出身貴族，秉性質樸，而有學者風度的政治家，會為了他的政治主義，甘脆地犧牲他個人的快樂、這究竟是什麼一回事呢？原來許希尼格博士自從一九三五年汽車遇險，他的夫人死在身邊後，至今還沒有續絃。他每天公畢回家的時候，很感到孤寂，况且他所處的地位，負担很重，沒有一位心愛的太太，安慰心神，是很有損於健康的。他因此臨時留心物色，在幾番躊躇之後，才决定了一個目標所　　　的　　　　　　　　　　　　　且還有四個兒女。她是前奧匈帝國世界聞名的－位大臣之女，她的丈夫是匈牙利的一位伯爵，她現在年已三十四歲，雖是個半老徐娘，但她的艷色，在匈國貴族中是人人愛慕的。所以許氏對她的愛情，熱度極高，她呢，也很願意改嫁這世界赫赫有名的狄克推多。眼望着這兩個有情人，不久便可成其好事，於是奧國也要發生一件辛柏森夫人情案了。這個消息，使奧國的國社黨不勝歡忭，因為國社黨在前任總理綽號小拿破侖陶爾夫斯秉政的時候，起事未成，但陶氏却在變亂之中，為國捐軀。許希尼格博士本是陶氏的心腹，他在國難危急的當兒，承繼了陶氏遺任，况有前車之鑒，自然仍用强硬手段，對付國社黨。國社黨雖費了九牛二虎之力，總不能把許氏推倒，　得奧國的　　　現在却遇到　會，可使這位鐵漢總理，像英國前皇愛德華一般，為了心愛的美人，情情願願地讓位。原來奧國是以天主教為國教，許氏也是天主教的信徒，按照教律，不能跟離婚婦結婚，許氏身為總理，破壞教律，决不能為全國所容，所以只有見機自退，免得被逐。雖外面傳說那伯爵夫人已請求教皇下諭取銷她的婚約，但教皇的權力，總敵不過公論的。因此國社黨人人興高采烈，通知已故匈總理貢博斯的同黨，準備承繼許氏的人物。因為貢氏在世時，是奧匈兩國國社黨的贊助人，奧匈的國社黨，已打成一片了。國社黨覺得這個問題，現在已到了焦點，只要一封書信，便能解决，他們意中承繼許氏的人物，只有兩人，一是維也納的市長教會派施米滋，那是國社黨的仇敵，一是親德派奧國外長施米德博士，那是國社黨的好友，只等待許氏宣布婚期，便可逼他辭職。奧國天主教徒得到這個消息，大為驚惶，聽說主教林資曾嚴重勸告了許氏一番。後來許氏便忍痛决計不步愛德華皇七世的後塵，他曾告知最親信的同僚，他寗願犧牲個人的快樂，保全奧國的政制。許氏自從愛上了那位伯爵夫人，他的心中，被私人問題縈擾着，在一月間曾發過一次演說，對於政治，表露冷淡的情感。國社黨便乘機活動，組織了一個小政治團體，假託是文化機關，背後却準備集合一九三四年舉事失敗後散播在四處的同黨，打算重振旗鼓，達到他們的政治目的。許氏也明知道他們的陰謀，起初被愛情牽制，沒有理睬，但最近對祖國陣綫領袖所發的演說，把國社黨的隱情，全盤托出，着着實實教訓了他們一番。於是國社黨的一團熱望，化為冰冷，而匈牙利正統派貴族所抱的哈浦斯堡皇室復辟希望，却又因此由冷轉熱。因為許氏斬割愛情的原故，是為了自己將來能够把他所擇定的一人，置在奧國的皇位，其實許氏本人，確也有這個大位的希望。事有凑巧的，奧國現在住着兩位情塲奮鬥的大人物，一是不愛江山愛美人的英遜皇溫德莎公爵，一便是為了政權，忍痛斬割愛情的許總理。所傷心的，是那位伯爵夫人，但辛柏森夫人知道這事後，更要感激她愛人的熱情了。</p>
<h3>島市小記</h3>
<p>— 拓人</p>
<p>深黑色的巨浪，在向着岸邊的岩石衝擊，那衝擊的濤聲，終年終日的在這荒野的小島的週遭響動着，雖然在這裏也有着魚夫們的足跡，可是他們是那樣的胆小，只是當着太陽照耀着海面，而浪濤在稍為靜息的時候，才看見他們在那很小的角落的岸邊，張着那破舊的魚網，唱着柔弱的山歌，而在這荒漠的野島上，一切都在自由雜亂的生長着，野草和松林蓋去了山的外貌，野貓和山犬佔有了這兒的世界，每當着太陽的金光射在綠蔭的山野上，巨鵬就會展開着翅膀在陽光中飛翔着，一切都在光明自由的世界裏生長着，死滅着。夜的黑影雖會吞去了這裏的一切，顯出了黑暗的恐懼，可是那岸邊上點點的魚燈，松林雜草間魚夫們燃燒的野火，以及山犬和野貓底飢餓的咆哮，却到處在衝破着夜的恐怖的幕布。總之，在這裏的一切是自由的，活潑的。可是這一切却給文明的火光所燒毀，而成為百餘年前的陳跡了，今日在這裏見到的，不是那荒漠的自由的野島，而是近代文明的世界，東方的巨大的島市了。</p>
<p>雖然濃黑的巨浪還在向着岸邊衝擊，可是它却不能動搖一下那鋼骨的碼頭，雖然這裏的野草和松林還是那麼濃密的蒙住着山的外貌，但那是經過修理，</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>西班牙海陸空軍大戰</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>據昨報載，西班牙北部政府軍與國民軍，爭取比爾波城，海陸空軍大戰，現仍在猛烈進行中，德意志軍在西作戰，國際形勢，十分緊張云云，我曾言之，現當火藥氣味充滿着世界任何一角，大戰的爆發，隨時隨地有發生的可能性，因為一部號稱富强的國家，沒有充分的準備，沒有勝利的把握，尚未敢公然開鱟，擴大戰機，這是大戰的時機，還未成熟，所以尚得苟安一時。</p>
<p>但是這種苟安的現象，若照現在的情勢看來，亦有不克保持之勢，蓋西班牙之戰，名義上是政府軍與國民軍的戰爭，而事實上乃是法西斯派與非法西斯派的戰爭，這已是公開的事實，任何人不能否認的了，任何一方面的勝利，而西班牙必為兩方的犧牲者，此實最為可慘之事也，德意兩國援助民軍，異常出力，預料可操必勝之權，不料相持數月，未得結果，不免惱羞成怒，積極增兵，大有破釜沉舟之勢，而在英法方面，則組織不干涉西班牙內戰委員會，嚴密監視德意軍隊，如此情形，恐非演成大戰的局面不止。</p>
<p>并且德自宣布重整軍備，意自出兵阿比西尼亞以來，英法兩國，對此兩役，初亦有武力干涉之意，結果為兩國暴力所懾服，一塲大氣，免得淘成，然而英法兩國，對於外交上態度的軟化，原是無法掩飾的，所以英國會議員，曾提出過嚴厲的質問，以為當局對外態度，異常懦怯，大為不滿，這雖因一般議員先生，對於國家的困難，容有所未知，或有所未諒，在當局自有不得已之苦衷，但是英國愈退步，則對方愈進步，英國愈軟弱，則對方愈强硬，這原是必然的局面，所以英法兩國，到了今日，非抱最大的决心，恐後日更有不可預料的危險。</p>
<p>在英法兩國之意，以為一面敷衍，一面擴軍，現在雖暫屈於一時，希望昭雪於後日，要知你雖擴軍，彼亦擴軍，你雖準備，彼亦準備，所以何時可操必勝之權，何時有勝利的把握，則恐遙遙無期矣，而最最危險的便是英國，英國的本身，祇有英倫三島，而其殖民地則遍於全球，故英國的生命綫，便是地中海與蘇彝士河，故意大利既得阿國，則地中海又與意國發生重要關係，地中海之霸權，不免將淪落於意大利之手，英之危機，卽在此矣，昨日意國講壇報上，特載一文，很為露骨，其言曰，英國在地中海之霸權，今已成為歷史陳迹，永告結束，地中海濱，今有一少壯之國家，奮臂而起，决定取英國之地位而代之，不知英國對此，將作若何之感想也。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>整齊的，而且它已蓋不住那點綴山野間的白色的大廈。盤旋在山野間的是黑色巨蛇似的柏油路，而不是那給魚夫們採薪時足跡所壓平的亦色的小徑，漁夫張着魚網的岸邊，已是穿梭着車馬的船埠，巨大的屋宇代替了那低矮的草舍。當着太陽照着海面和山野時，沒有巨𫜸的飛翔，也沒有魚夫的山曲。所有的是飛機的黑影，汽笛的狂聲，夜的岸邊的魚燈和松林間的野火，變成了光亮的火炬，沒有夜的恐怖，沒有黑暗的布幕，一切是文明，是快樂熱鬧的世界。</p>
<p>然而當着你看到了那存留於公園中的巨口的鋼砲，那給作為籬柱的黑色的巨彈，那你會知道，會理解到那就是從荒野到文明的工具，由於它，百餘年前的荒野的小島，才會造成為今日文明的世界。</p>
<p>在自由，在光明的荒漠的世界裏的主人——魚夫，在今日已是沒有他們插足的餘地了，雖然那瘦小的黃色的臉的人種，在這裏還有着很多，可是他們已不是這裏的主人，這裏已經沒有他們的世界，因為屬於他們的所有的，已經給那巨口的鋼砲和黑色的巨彈所毀滅了。今日的主人說：“我們是文明，我們把荒漠的野蠻的世界改造了，我們才是今日文明的主人！”於是他們快樂的微笑着。可是他們沒有承認，從荒野的文明，那些毀滅以往的一切的工具，也是野蠻的東西，而文明也就是從野蠻的工具去創造的。</p>
<p>被今日的文明的主人所統治着的那些懦弱的以前的主人，也許他們在文明的享受之下會忘記去了以往的一切，忘記去了那屬於他們所有的自由的光明的荒島吧！可是當着看到了巨大的鋼砲和黑色的巨彈時，那過去的恥辱，那被文明的工具所刺痛着的創痕，一切的以往的悲劇就會在心中閃現着。</p>
<p>荒野是變成了文明了，可是荒野時代的主人就這樣永遠的在文明的新主統治下生活着嗎？就這樣永遠的忘記去被毀滅時的一切，而在文明之下快樂着嗎？</p>
<p>我們不要忘記，在從荒野到文明的歷程中，是有過血肉染着砲彈的野蠻時代！</p>

Xu said, "I am old and weak, and I have repeatedly requested to resign upon returning to the country. However, I have been repeatedly comforted by the central government and have decided to return to my post next month. Regarding the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, I personally believe that political obstacles must first be removed. The same applies to the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. I personally believe that to improve Sino-Japanese relations, three spirits are required: first, mutual tolerance; second, mutual trust; and third, mutual assistance. I hope that you can all do your best based on this policy. In handling diplomacy, I will of course follow the orders of the government. As for the abolition of consular jurisdiction, I have not yet heard of it. However, I have served in the domestic judicial system and am very concerned about this issue. I have always believed that this issue can be divided into three parts: ㊀ law, ㊁ judicial officials, and ㊂ prisons. Through more than 20 years of continuous efforts, various improvements in our judiciary have been quite significant, which I believe you are all aware of." Xu is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 11th, Fenghua on the 13th, and return to Nanjing on the 17th.

After about 20 minutes, Kawagoe left.

<h3>Founding Meeting of the National Goods United Corporation Held in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Election of Directors and Supervisors, Wu Dingchang Elected as Chairman</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The founding meeting of the National Goods United Corporation was held at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce at 3:00 PM on the 10th. Many people attended, including Wu Dingchang and representatives of official and commercial shares, such as Cai Shengbai, Xu Guanqun, Wu Yunchu, and Guo Shun. Wu Dingchang presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, stating that the establishment of the National Goods United Corporation has a great relationship with various industries. On the one hand, the national goods factories across the country can organize a national sales network for national goods, which has a close relationship with the national goods company. On the other hand, the sales of national textiles, handicrafts, and local products can be increased. In addition, there is an even more important significance, that is, the establishment of the national goods company will enable people across the country to have the opportunity to purchase national goods and enable China's economy to have a major development. The significance of the government's establishment of this company lies in promoting national goods, not for profit. Therefore, in the future, after the business development of this company, the government's shares can be transferred to the business community. According to the regulations, official shares account for one-third, but in fact various companies and factories are actively participating, so commercial shares account for three-quarters, while official shares only account for one-quarter. This is enough to show the business community's trust in the government and their willingness to cooperate with the government. After Wu's speech, Cheng Zhiyi and Wang Xingyao reported on the preparations, and Wu Dingchang read the company's articles of association again. Then, Wu Yunchu, Fang Yixian, Cai Shengbai, Xu Yangnan, Fang Jiange, Zhu Wenqi, Ren Shigang, Ye Youcai, Cheng Nianpeng, and Qin Kecheng were elected as ten commercial directors; Guo Shun, Chen Xiaodie, Chen Jiqing, and Lu Zhixue were elected as four alternate commercial directors; and Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Xu Guanqun, and Xiang Kangyuan were elected as commercial supervisors. It was also announced that the National Economic Council had appointed Wu Dingchang, Zhou Yichun, Zhang Yiou, Liu Yinfu, and Cheng Zhiyi as five directors, and the contracted banking group had appointed Qian Yongming and Shi Jiu'ao as two directors, and the official supervisors were Huang Yanpei and Zhang Yuanshan. Then Wu Dingchang read the investigation report of the directors and supervisors. After taking a photo at 5:30 PM, the meeting was adjourned. The joint meeting of directors and supervisors was reopened in the same place. Wu Dingchang was elected as chairman, Fang Yixian, Cai Shengbai, Fang Jiange, and Ren Shigang as standing directors of commercial shares, and Huang Yanpei, Guo Shun, and Wang Zhixin as standing supervisors. It was also announced that Zhang Yiou was the standing director of the National Economic Council and Shi Jiu'ao was the standing director of the special banking group. Then discussed, ㊀ The case of preparing the National Goods Company in the capital, decided to hand it over to the Standing Committee for handling, ㊁ The case of writing off the company's establishment expenses, decided that the supervisors would sign and seal, ㊂ The case of receiving the documents and printed matter of the Preparatory Committee and the Secretariat Office, decided that after the general and deputy managers were produced, they would be received on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Board of Directors. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. The first meeting of the Standing Committee of the Board of Directors of the company is scheduled to be held at Wu Dingchang's residence in Beijing at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 11th to discuss the election of the general and deputy managers of the company and all important progress matters of the company.

<h3>Sichuan Provincial Government Discusses Construction Program</h3>
<p>[Chengdu] The provincial government convened the heads of various departments and agencies at noon on the 10th to discuss the construction program of Sichuan Province. Liu Xiang first delivered a speech, indicating the direction, and emphasized the need to pay attention to developing transportation, establishing mechanical production, improving local products, and developing border reclamation. Liu's report was very long. Then the directors of various departments and committees expressed their opinions. Finally, it was decided that the substantive plans should be drafted by the various departments and then discussed before being submitted to the Design Committee for collation and submission before the start of the new year. According to Deng Hanxiang, the provincial government has focused on sorting out and combing through the past two years. Now, in order to build a new Sichuan, make the people prosperous, and shoulder the mission of national rejuvenation, it is necessary to formulate an entire plan. Therefore, a comprehensive plan is made to echo the central government's construction plan. For example, developing transportation and increasing production are the main points. As for demobilizing soldiers, it is better to plan and develop the border, so that those who are demobilized have a way out. However, this is a major matter, and it is necessary to gather ideas and implement a practical plan step by step. (10th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Ambition of Prince De (4)</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Qian Bi</p>
<p>Most Mongolians Have a Deep Awareness; Banners and People in the Border Area Flee to Outer Mongolia</p>
<p>㊄ Visiting Mrs. Stone</p>
<p>Although Mongolian culture is backward, their wisdom is extraordinary. In particular, their tough and hardworking physique and indomitable spirit are truly worthy of our admiration and praise. Because the oppression of difficult circumstances has placed many restrictions on their talents, preventing them from developing, in a certain era, extremely great figures will suddenly emerge. This is the meaning of the saying that the times create heroes. I spoke with many Mongolian princes and nobles in Suiyuan. Their sincere attitude, humble speech, and intelligent thinking all left a very good impression. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to meet with Prince De, otherwise I would definitely have been able to hear him deliver a great speech. At that time, there was Prince Kang in Suiyuan, the Jasagh of the Darad Banner in the Ikezhao League, whose full name was Kangda Dorje. He was also an extremely intelligent person. He could drive a car himself and had the ability to repair various machines. He brought the latest Contaflex reflex camera and very kindly took photos for people. According to him, his favorite thing to do in his life was to play with photography. He had dozens of cameras, large and small, old and new, displayed in his home, which was truly interesting. In the past, the trigger for the split of the Chahar-Suiyuan Mongolian banners was the so-called West Gong Banner incident. The Stone Prince of the West Gong Banner initially had a bad relationship with the League Leader Prince Yun. This was originally unrelated to Prince De. Later, the Stone Prince's former wife had an affair with Mantu, a subordinate of the Stone Prince, and he expelled Mantu from the territory. Mantu went to Bao Yueqing, who worked for Prince De. Bao appointed him as a gatekeeper in the Stone Prince's territory. The Stone Prince was furious, considering it an intentional insult, and reported it to the Mongolian Political Council. Prince De wanted to punish Mantu at that time and summoned the Stone Prince for questioning. However, the Stone Prince mistakenly believed that Prince De was unfavorable to him and refused to go to Bailingmiao against orders. The misunderstandings between the two sides deepened day by day. Later, although various parties mediated, the Stone Prince's former wife also committed suicide by taking poison. On the surface, it came to an end, but in reality, it created a very deep rift. Now the Stone Prince is also dead, and there is the so-called inheritance problem. After the suicide of the Stone Prince's former wife, the current wife is the very famous Ms. Shi Qijunfeng in the Mongolian banners. She is currently eight months pregnant. Since the Stone Prince died without a son, he cannot inherit the position. Two factions within the banner are vying for the right to act as Jasagh. As a result, the Suiyuan authorities sought to mediate a solution, and the two faction leaders, Sakh Durjabu and Selengbu, were appointed as assistants, with Sakh serving as acting Jasagh. If Ms. Shi gives birth to a son, he can be named Jasagh according to custom, and can officially inherit the title at the age of eighteen. Because of this inheritance issue, Ms. Shi Qijunfeng, the Stone Prince's wife, stayed in Suiyuan for several months. This lady did not marry the Stone Prince long ago, and is from the Darad Banner of the Ikezhao League. The Darad Banner is famous for producing beauties. The Stone Prince's wife is only twenty-four years old and is also very beautiful. The Mongolian people's horsemanship is inherently not weak, and the Stone Prince's wife is even more of an expert, able to fire guns with both hands with a very high hit rate. In recent years, she has followed the Stone Prince in leading troops to suppress bandits, and has made many contributions, truly a female hero. She stayed at the Suixin Hotel in Suiyuan. I visited her the day after I arrived in Suiyuan. She was staying in a superior room with three large rooms, and the guards and adjutants lived in several side rooms. After talking with the adjutant for a while, he led me to the superior room. In the room, there was a white curtain separating the space. Mrs. Stone was wearing a mourning cheongsam and very humbly asked me to sit down repeatedly. She lived with her mother and spoke very fluent Beijing dialect. She said that she had studied at the Beijing Women's Middle School when she was young, and her home was behind the back door in Beijing, so her entire life had been Sinicized. She spoke very frankly. When she talked about riding horses and killing thieves, she was eloquent and animated. She said that riding horses and shooting guns was a family tradition, and that all Mongolian women could do both, which was not surprising at all. She also talked about the integration of the Han and Mongolians, Mongolian construction, and other issues, and had very insightful opinions. Before leaving, I asked her to take a picture, and she agreed very generously, standing in front of the corridor, saying that the light was very good here, please take the picture. I left very satisfied, and the Mongolian issue continued to linger in my mind, unable to be removed for a moment. (End)</p>

<h3>The Difference in Understanding China Between Europe, America, and Japan and Its Impact</h3>
<p>— Wu Shichang</p>
<p>The calls for "adjusting Sino-Japanese national relations" and "Sino-Japanese cooperation" have recently been clamoring loudly again. Japanese foreign policy and public opinion have also repeatedly changed their attitude towards China recently. Although their arguments are always nothing more than the difference between gradual and rapid aggression against China. Attitudes and arguments must, of course, be based on observation and understanding, and the frequent changes in diplomatic proposals by people from both the government and the public in that country show that their understanding of China has not yet been established at this moment, and their previous understanding is in the process of shaking and modification. If we can take this opportunity to fundamentally reverse what we have done in the past, restore the international normality before the "September 18th" Incident and then talk about cooperation, that would truly be a blessing for East Asia and the world. But after seeing the rampant smuggling in the north and south, the influx of narcotics, and the abnormality of the Hebei-Chahar political regime, etc., we feel that the future is still very bleak. The Japanese people have suffered too deeply from their previous misunderstanding of China! The Japanese often wonder why Chinese students who have studied in Europe and the United States have a good impression of the countries where they have studied, while students who have studied in Japan are the opposite? Why do Chinese people welcome and cooperate with Europeans and Americans of different cultures and races so much, but avoid the Japanese of the same culture and race as if they are afraid of them? This is all due to the difference in understanding, and national policies and attitudes also change accordingly, and China's reaction to various countries is also very different.</p>
<p>Originally, Japan was China's brother. Its culture was completely separated from China. After breaking away from the mother body of China, it was able to be independent, and in the past sixty years, it has learned the skills of Westerners, which can win glory for the yellow race. When it comes to understanding China, whether in terms of character or culture, it should be more correct and accurate than Westerners. However, the reality is just the opposite. Westerners do not fully understand the Chinese people and Chinese culture, but they believe that there are several common principles that must be followed in the relationship between people. Moral concepts in the East and West can be different, but peace or violence, trustworthiness or rascality, honesty or cunning, benefiting others and oneself or harming others without benefiting oneself, are things that can be understood and avoided by all societies, from primitive peoples to the most civilized societies. Western industrial and commercial countries engaged in colonial activities and trade overseas. Around the seventeenth century, they were all pirate policies. But if they want to maintain permanent commercial interests, they know that they cannot always be pirates and must be regular merchants. Individual behavior is like this, and national policy is also like this. As China progresses, their observations and attitudes also progress. A century ago, they could declare war on China for the opium trade, but now they will never do such a shameless thing. In the era of the May 30th Incident, it was still a violent and barbaric policy, but when the Chinese people rose up to fight for freedom and equality and overthrow the corrupt Beiyang warlords, the Chamberlain Cabinet immediately approved the "Chen-O'Malley Agreement" and returned the Hankou—and later Jiujiang—concessions to China. They know that the killing of foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion was not the original intention of the Chinese people, but only the blind action of a few rioters, and that it is unreasonable to put the huge amount of reparations on the shoulders of the Chinese people every year thereafter, so they voluntarily gave up and used the money to develop China's cultural undertakings. They believe that as long as China progresses and prospers, their overseas business will naturally develop and benefit together, so they sincerely help China and sincerely hope that China will be rich, strong and stable. In fact, the returned Boxer Indemnity has already been earned back in terms of commerce. Westerners do not have a very thorough understanding of Chinese culture and the Chinese character, and they are often ridiculous, especially confused in small places, but as long as they can recognize the overall situation, these small details do not hinder the overall diplomatic strategy. Westerners' understanding of China is able to recognize the overall situation.</p>
<p>Looking back at Japan, we get the exact opposite phenomenon, which is very painful. Japan's understanding of Chinese culture is of course deeper than that of Europe and the United States—many ancient Chinese cultures are still preserved in Japan, and their understanding of the Chinese character, even if they do not come to China, will be clearer than that of Europeans and Americans just by looking in the mirror. But what is strange is that their observation of Chinese politics has always been interpreted in the worst way, and they are never willing to admit China's advantages and progress (unless Europeans and Americans have repeatedly admitted it, they follow behind and echo a few words). All kinds of bad names attached to China, such as "disorganized country" and "North China people's movement is separated from the central government," all come from China's East; if China is unfortunate enough to have political disputes, the worst speculations are promoted by our newspapers of the same culture and race. And what is especially painful is that in the past, every time there was internal turmoil in China, they manipulated or encouraged it. They did not want to see China have a strong and powerful central government. When the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived in Shandong, they attacked the Northern Expeditionary Army, and when Zhang Zuolin left the country, they bombed Zhang Zuolin. They specialize in studying the lower classes of the Chinese people's psychology. They have university graduates stationed there to study the Tianqiao area in Beijing, the Three-No-Zone area in Tianjin, etc. Whether it is the organization of bandits or the black language of various industries, they study it more clearly than the Chinese themselves. Therefore, they have many "China experts." These "China experts" are very self-confident in their understanding of the Chinese psychology. However, the lower classes exist in all countries, and their psychology is exactly the morbid state of a country that needs education and correction. It is very wrong and dangerous to take this as the normal state of a country's people. Seeing a small part of the morbid state without recognizing the overall normal state is exactly what Mencius called "able to see the tip of an autumn hair but not a cartload of firewood!"</p>
<p>Due to the unhealthy knowledge of the "China experts" in that country, coupled with the unique character of the island nation, and the unfortunate phenomenon that China was made extremely poor and weak by the former Qing government and has not yet been able to recover, Japan's policy toward China has been extremely bad, causing many pains between the two countries. In the future, it is not known who will suffer more. If Japan really wants to adjust the relations between the two countries and enable the two major countries in East Asia to cooperate, the first step is to correct the psychology of understanding China, reverse the previous concepts, and understand the will of the Chinese people in general. And at this moment, the most universal and firm will of the Chinese people is: we must restore China's lost territorial rights, we can use goodwill to restore them, or we can use iron and blood!</p>
<h3>The Success of the Japanese Aircraft "Kamikaze" is Universally Praised by the European and American Aviation Industries</h3>
<p>Asahi Shimbun's Letter to the People of the United Kingdom States That This Act Will Enhance Friendship Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>[London] After the Japanese aircraft Kamikaze arrived here, the local public opinion unanimously expressed goodwill, praising its excellent machinery and the superb skills of the pilots. The Daily Telegraph published an article today entitled "The Victory of Japanese Aviation," which stated that the most visible demonstration of Japan's significant progress among the countries of the world is the success of this flight. The newspaper further stated that this alone is enough to show that the Japanese nation is keeping pace with other nations in the progress of global scientific development. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[New York] Baker, the manager of an American airline, pointed out that the success of the Japanese-made aircraft Kamikaze in flying from Tokyo to London in 100 hours is an amazing achievement. He said that the route chosen by the Japanese aviators this time was not a route with various good facilities, and they did not give advance notice, but they broke the previous record, which is truly worthy of our greatest congratulations. Chadwick, chairman of the American branch of the International Aeronautical Federation, said that congratulations can be sent to the pilots and manufacturers of this aircraft. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Paris] The official records department of the International Aviation Federation here announced on the evening of the 9th the record of the Kamikaze aircraft, stating that the Kamikaze flight from Tokyo to Paris took 92 hours and 18 minutes, setting a new record. According to past records, French aviators Coste and Rignot completed the journey in six days, ten hours, and fifty-three minutes in 1928. (9th Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The French aviator Chappy sent a radio message from the French mail ship President Doumergue today to the Asahi Shimbun, saying that it is truly an unprecedented event in the history of world aviation to achieve such a result with a newly manufactured aircraft. It is enough to show the great progress in the technological development of Japanese aircraft factories and the high level of skills of Japanese technicians. He unfortunately touched a mountain in Kyushu during his previous attempt to fly from Paris to Tokyo, and received warm sympathy from the Japanese people, so he is particularly pleased with the success of the Kamikaze in creating a record. Both sides admire each other's achievements in the sky, which is also enough to promote international friendship. British Ambassador to Japan Clive also sent a congratulatory message on the success of the Kamikaze, saying that the results are better than expected by ordinary people, and he hopes that the aircraft will break the world record for flying from London back to Tokyo and participate in the flight races between England, Australia, and South Africa. (Central News Agency 10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The Japanese Asahi Shimbun aircraft "Kamikaze", piloted by aviators Iinuma and Tsukagoshi, departed from Tokyo and arrived at Croyden Aerodrome near here at 3:30 pm today, completing a journey of more than 15,000 kilometers in three days, twenty-one hours, and eighteen minutes, setting a new world record. Here is a detailed account of its arrival in London:</p>
<p>When the news that the "Kamikaze" was flying from Paris to London reached Croyden Aerodrome, it was immediately crowded with people. No less than 6,000 people were waiting for the Japanese aircraft. The police had difficulty maintaining order. At 3:25 pm, the "Kamikaze" had already appeared in the sky, and at 3:30 pm, it landed on the north side of the aerodrome. It immediately reduced its speed and circled the open space for a week. At that time, the spectators all wanted to rush to the front of the aircraft, and the police repeatedly tried to stop them and maintain order. Before long, the aircraft stopped, and the Japanese aviators Iinuma and Tsukagoshi came out of the aircraft. Although both looked travel-worn, they were both smiling. They were greeted by Sir Holben, Director of the British Overseas Aviation Bureau, who recited a welcome speech, saying, "I welcome you to our country and congratulate you on setting a glorious record. I now represent the British aviation community in expressing our welcome and congratulations. Your arrival from Tokyo is a great honor for the people of our country, and we are especially pleased that your trip was safe and successful."</p>
<p>At this time, two Japanese girls approached and offered each of the two aviators a bouquet of flowers decorated with the Japanese national emblem. The two aviators immediately kissed them, and the crowd at the scene applauded and cheered. After the Japanese aviators had left the aerodrome, the crowd still surrounded the "Kamikaze" for several hours, admiring the small silver, blue, and yellow aircraft that had broken through a long distance of more than 15,000 kilometers. Iinuma and Tsukagoshi were accompanied by diplomatic officials to a hotel attached to the aerodrome, where they were served tea and snacks, and made a radio broadcast to Japan. First-class British aviators, such as Captain Lewin, Captain Scott, Mrs. Macken, and the famous aircraft manufacturing engineer Miles, were all present to celebrate the success of the Japanese aviators, and expressed their admiration for the bravery of the Japanese aviation community and the excellence of industrial manufacturing. Later, the aviators drove to a large hotel in the West End of London and checked in. When entering the hotel, they declined to issue a statement to the press and immediately went to the bedroom to rest. The room was decorated with cherry blossoms. The two also ordered the waiter to wake them up at 9:30 tomorrow morning so that they could talk to their families in Tokyo on a long-distance call, as long-distance calls between the United Kingdom and Japan can only be made between 8:00 am and 11:45 am.

<p>[London] The Japanese aviators Iinuma and Tsukagoshi, who flew the Asahi Shimbun's aircraft "Kamikaze" to this place, carried a letter from the Osaka Asahi Shimbun to the British people, signed by the president of the newspaper, which read, "The Asahi Shimbun has sent two famous Japanese aviators to your country and entrusted them with three missions. As King George VI of England is about to hold his coronation ceremony, we would like to extend our congratulations to the British government and people on behalf of the Japanese people. First, to convey Japan's good wishes to European countries. Second, to hope to create a new aviation record between Tokyo and London. Third, England is our old ally. We are very honored to be able to extend our sincere congratulations on the occasion of the King's coronation ceremony. We have sent two sky messengers to connect the two continents of Europe and Asia, from Tokyo to London, which also expresses our enthusiasm, friendship and good wishes to the British people, which will remain the same as always. Moreover, this flight proves the progress of Japanese industry, and the exchange of skies between England and Japan will further enhance the friendship between the two countries. This is what we sincerely pray for." The conclusion reads, "May God bless the King whom your people love." (Central News Agency Ninth Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Filipino Youths Evade Military Service</h3>
<p>Hundreds of People Detained and Imprisoned</p>
<p>[Manila] Hundreds of youths in Leyte province refused to go to training camps for military training today, resulting in their arrest and imprisonment. The prisons are overcrowded. It is said that there are between 300 and 700 such youths. In addition, the Gazette newspaper reported that draft evasion incidents have also occurred in other provinces. However, since the Philippine military service law does not have explicit provisions for punishment, it is still questionable how the authorities will deal with these youths.

<h3>Cabinet of Hayashi Announces Election Platform</h3>
<p>Renovating Education and Politics, Stabilizing the People's Livelihood; Financial Circles Say They Don't Know How to Achieve It</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government, in preparation for the upcoming election, has decided to publicize its own new policies to both domestic and international audiences. Cabinet meetings have been convened daily to expedite the process. Today, at 1:30 PM, the cabinet formally made the following decisions in a cabinet meeting. Prime Minister Hayashi immediately went to the Imperial Palace to inform the Emperor and announced the platform at 4:00 PM the same day, as follows:</p>
<p>Based on the previously declared political platform, the important policies to be implemented promptly are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Renovating Education: To promote the concretization of various strategies for renovating teaching, extend the length of compulsory education, and reform the entire academic system to ensure their realization. Furthermore, an authoritative deliberative body will be established within the cabinet to thoroughly promote the concept of national essence and revitalize the national spirit.</p>
<p>㊁ Renovating Politics: Improving administration and reforming the parliamentary and electoral systems. Regarding the advancement of national fortune and the improvement of administrative organizations, this includes establishing new central aviation administrative bodies, reforming the official system, and renovating various front-line administrative affairs to benefit the public.</p>
<p>㊂ To concretize a unified national foreign policy as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>㊃ Enhancing military preparedness to prepare for national mobilization.</p>
<p>㊄ Thoroughly pursuing social policies to stabilize the people's livelihood, promote national physical education, establish various social insurance systems, and encourage and promote the welfare of workers, striving to maintain and increase labor productivity to stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>㊅ Comprehensive Development of Industry: Striving to expand national power. For important industries such as iron and liquid fuels, measures must be taken to achieve self-sufficiency in raw materials. Implement comprehensive industrial integration to expand productivity and promote small and medium-sized commerce and industry. Strengthen the control of electric power and improve and expand communication facilities.</p>
<p>㊆ Revitalizing Agriculture, Mountains, Fisheries, and Villages: Establishing agricultural land policies and agricultural insurance systems, popularizing rural industries, striving to improve the production conditions of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Simultaneously, promoting the concept of unity throughout the village to revitalize agriculture, mountains, fisheries, and villages.</p>
<p>㊇ Reforming the Tax System: To improve prices and international balance of payments, aiming for a balanced national burden. For the sake of national existence and development, cultivate necessary national financial resources, implement reforms to central and local tax systems, and devise measures to curb the rise in domestic prices. Fundamentally adjust the supply and demand relationship of goods, while ensuring the availability of raw material resources, the progress of trade, the development of maritime transport, and the promotion of immigration. All of these must be diligently pursued to improve the international balance of payments.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government decided on new policies at an extraordinary cabinet meeting on the 10th. Here are the plans for their implementation:</p>
<p>㊀ Regarding Renovating Education: The Cabinet plans to establish a new council dedicated to thoroughly promoting the concept of national essence and revitalizing the national spirit.</p>
<p>㊁ Regarding Improving the Parliamentary and Electoral Systems: The previous cabinet had already established two investigative committees. These committees will continue to work, and a concrete proposal will be formulated quickly.</p>
<p>㊂ Establishing a New Central Aviation Administrative Body: To facilitate joint research by the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Communications to realize a Ministry of Aviation, an Aviation Institute, or an Aviation Agency.</p>
<p>㊃ Regarding Improving the Official System: Striving to revise the Civil Service Appointment Ordinance to open up avenues for talent acquisition.</p>
<p>㊄ Establishing a Cabinet Planning Bureau quickly to formulate concrete plans for various new policies. This is part of improving the administrative structure.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned guidelines have all been decided, and close liaison with each ministry will be maintained so that new policy proposals can be submitted to the special Diet as much as possible. The meeting adjourned at 3:20 PM after discussions.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Financial circles' views on the current cabinet's new policies are generally as follows:</p>
<p>The scope of this announcement largely covers the policy outlines Hayashi's cabinet presented when it was formed. The specific methods of implementing the listed policies are not clear. In particular, the measures to implement this year's large budget and adjust frictions in the financial sector were not mentioned. The only point of slight interest to the financial sector is the comprehensive development of industry, the price control measures, and the improvement of the international balance of payments. In order to solve these problems simultaneously, a process of contradiction and overcoming must be undergone. However, the problem is not only this; the same difficult friction is expected to occur with other important policies. On the one hand, the current cabinet's foundation is extremely weak to implement important policies. Whether it can maintain its regime when it embodies its platform and policies is also doubtful.

<h3>Japan to Issue Small Denomination Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Hoping to Popularize Government Bonds</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Finance recently decided to have post offices throughout the country sell government bonds starting in July, hoping to popularize government bonds and improve the public's understanding of national finance. The Ministry of Finance's goal in ordering post offices to sell government bonds is to spread government bonds widely among the people, so it was decided to issue small-denomination government bonds to facilitate purchases. The newly issued government bonds will be in denominations of 25 yen and 50 yen and will be sold exclusively at post office windows. Most of the approximately 50 million yen in deficit bonds are said to be small-denomination bonds. (10th, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Denies Suppressing Gold Prices</h3>
<p>French Finance Minister Denies Franc Devaluation Again</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt declared today that he was completely unaware of rumors in New York and London that the Treasury Department would suppress gold prices, and that the US Treasury Department has no plans to lower gold prices. The news was spread by foreign newspapers. (9th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt recently conferred with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Federal Reserve Chairman Eccles on the financial situation. Afterward, the president made a statement to the press. (9th, Havas Agency)</p>
<p>[Washington] It is now understood that although the Treasury Department denies that there will be any changes to the gold policy, it is closely monitoring the work of the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System. The committee has purchased government long-term bonds worth 25,194,000 yuan in the past ten days. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Paris] British newspapers report that the French franc will be devalued again, and the exchange rate between British, French, and American currencies will be adjusted again. Finance Minister Olivar recently stated to a Havas Agency interviewer that he firmly denies this and that rumors that France will issue a "tourism franc" during the Paris International Exposition specifically for foreign tourists are also untrue. (9th, Havas Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After receiving a telegram about the sharp decline of the French franc, the Yokohama Specie Bank, in addition to increasing the exchange rate by two sen the day before, further increased the telegraphic transfer rate to France by five sen today, revising it to 6 francs 5 sen per yen. (10th, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Judicial Plan</h3>
<p>Receives Much Criticism</p>
<p>[Washington] Dr. Mather, Dean of the University of Missouri Law School, criticized President Roosevelt's judicial reform plan in the Senate Judiciary Committee today, saying that after its implementation, the six new Supreme Court justices could use "go-slow" tactics to prevent other justices from handling cases, and President Roosevelt's power could exceed the Constitution. Democratic Senator King William also read a letter from Yale University President Angell to Democratic Senator Walsh to the committee, criticizing President Roosevelt's poor political credibility.

<h3>Japan-Netherlands Commercial Treaty Concluded</h3>
<p>Formal Signing Next Month</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japan-Netherlands trade negotiations, which reopened last autumn, have been continuing by Consul-General Ishizawa stationed in Batavia and the Dutch East Indies authorities. This year, the negotiations proceeded smoothly, and on the 9th of this month, opinions were completely unified. The representatives of the two countries have already signed the agreement ad referendum. This agreement is intended to supplement the current Japan-Netherlands Treaty of Commerce and Navigation (signed in 1913). It is scheduled to be formally signed by representatives of the Japanese and Dutch governments in May this year. The Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities specifically issued a statement last night, saying that in May of Showa 9 (1934), the government sent representatives to Java to discuss trade issues with the Dutch East Indies authorities, but due to various circumstances, a final solution could not be reached. After the Japanese representatives returned home, the Japanese and Dutch governments continued negotiations, and after various twists and turns, an agreement was reached between maritime transport operators from both sides last June. Government-level negotiations have also made great progress as a result. Most recently, Consul-General Ishizawa and Hart of the Dutch East Indies reached an agreement. Currently, because the formal agreement has not yet been established, it is not convenient to announce its content. In short, the opinions of both sides have been unified, which will surely clarify the trade relations between the two countries. We are extremely fortunate, said the spokesman.

<h3>Shigemitsu Arrives in Paris</h3>

<h3>Canadian Auto Industry Strike</h3>
<p>Both Sides in a Standoff; Situation Tense</p>
<p>⊙ Oshawa. The automotive industry strike in Oshawa, Ontario, is developing today. Four thousand workers at General Motors announced a strike after the company refused to recognize the International Union of Automobile Workers. Subsequently, the company claimed that the factory would reopen today. However, after a meeting of the strike representatives, it was decided that any worker could safely enter the factory to work, but they would be regarded as strike-breakers. Therefore, the union would not be responsible for any accidents encountered by the worker after leaving the factory. At the same time, the Premier of Ontario, Hepburn, pointed out that the union's opposition was illegal and said that the government would provide assistance. Also, Mayor Hall announced today that if any worker is injured, the Canadian people will regard the union as a bandit organization. If any violence occurs, the local police will increase by three hundred within an hour. (10th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Oshawa. The Canadian General Motors factory strike remains unresolved today, indicating that a labor-management struggle is unavoidable. According to factory officials, 5,000 police officers will be summoned tomorrow to protect the parts manufacturing department so that it can continue to operate. Ontario Premier Hepburn opposes the strike and has agreed to mobilize the police yesterday to ensure reopening. The initiator of this strike, the organizer of the United Auto Workers, Thompson, responded to this by saying, "If the factory uses force to force reopening, I can make workers in General Motors factories across the United States help us." This strike truly shows that Canadian union members are trying to implement the conditions for resolving the strike of the American United Auto Workers. (9th, National News Agency)</p>

<h3>Six British Missionaries Expelled from Abyssinia</h3>
<p>British Ambassador Protests to Italian Government; United States to Take Similar Action</p>
<p>[London] Before Easter this year, six missionaries from the British Evangelical Mission were expelled from Abyssinia by the Italian authorities. Now, this matter has been raised in Rome in a serious protest by the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond. After receiving the notice of expulsion, these six people requested a postponement from Italian Governor General Graziani, citing the urgency of the time, but this was not allowed, and it was said that if the time limit was exceeded, they would be forcibly expelled. It is also heard that three important Abyssinian believers of the British Evangelical Mission have been shot by Italian soldiers, and forty or fifty students have been expelled to various villages. (10th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Rome] Officials at the American Embassy in Italy announced today that the American authorities will formally negotiate with Italy regarding the report in an Italian newspaper that several American expatriates in Abyssinia may be expelled. This kind of probing news in the Italian newspaper is sufficient to prove that the report that seven British missionaries have been expelled from Abyssinia is true. The Italian newspaper also reported that American expatriates and all Christians in Abyssinia may be expelled on suspicion of espionage. (9th, National News Agency)</p>
<h3>American Broadcasting Station Hires Hidemaro Konoye</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Hidemaro Konoye, who recently returned home from Europe, received a telegram yesterday from NBC, the largest broadcasting station in the United States, hiring him as a full-time conductor for the company and requesting him to travel to the United States when the weather turns cooler. All of NBC's conductors are world-class figures, the most famous being Toscanini. Konoye is now listed as one of the company's conductors alongside Toscanini, which is truly a sign of the rising prominence of the Japanese Western music scene, which has recently reached world standards.

<h3>Government Army in the Vicinity of Spain Achieves Total Victory in General Offensive</h3>
<p>Recapturing Several Important Rebel Positions; Both Armies Are Fighting Across the Lake in the Western Suburbs</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid. The government army's general offensive has driven the rebels out of the capital area today. The intensity of the fighting between the two armies is unprecedented since the start of the war. According to the government army's war report, no fewer than 10,000 rebels are trapped in the university district in the western suburbs. The government army's sudden offensive caught the rebels off guard, and the military deployment surrounding the capital was shaken by attacks from various government army forces. (9th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid. The government army fought fiercely with the enemy on the central front yesterday and immediately captured several important positions of the Nationalist army. At the same time, government army aircraft also dropped bombs and bombarded concentrations of the Nationalist army, inflicting heavy damage on them. The government army also advanced on the French Bridge in the southwestern suburbs of Madrid to achieve a pincer effect. The Nationalist army immediately withdrew from Mount Garabitas, and the area east of the mountain was captured by the government army. As a result, the Nationalist army in the university area in the western suburbs was isolated. After the government army occupied the town of Baja Carabanchel in the southern suburbs, the Nationalist army entrenched in the town of Upper Carabanchel also withdrew. (10th, Havas Agency)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid. After the government army launched a general offensive on all fronts in the vicinity of the capital, the battles in various places have been quite successful. General Miaja, Chairman of the National Defense Committee, declared tonight that the rebel positions in the university district in the western suburbs have fallen one after another, and the last one has also been surrounded and completely isolated from other rebel forces. The government army has made progress in the northwestern suburbs, from the town of Usera to the town of El Pardo. (9th, Havas Agency)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid. The government army and the rebels are now engaging in artillery battles across Lake Casa de Campo in the western suburbs. The government army is using 18-inch cannons to bombard the opposite shore. Casa de Campo is a large park where former King Alfonso used to hunt. It was occupied by the rebels on November 7 last year. Next to it is a large lake where Spanish lovers go boating. Since the government army began its general offensive yesterday, it has threatened the rebels to retreat gradually. There are no traces of rebels on this shore of the lake, but the other shore is still in the hands of the rebels. Many government army shells can hit the rebel positions, but some also fall into the water, and the waves are splashing like a naval battle. The sounds of rifles and machine guns are like a string of beads. There are also many government army planes bombing back and forth in the air, and the rumbling sound echoes the sound of guns. An Associated Press war correspondent risked going to the front line to inspect the scene and saw that the government army soldiers were eager to kill the enemy and were eager to charge forward. It was difficult for the officers to restrain them. In this offensive, more than 20 tanks led the way for the government troops. (10th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid. Navy Minister Prieto declared today, "The war has now entered the decisive stage. After the rebels' disastrous defeat in Guadalajara, they are indeed on the verge of collapse. In a few weeks, the war may be over." (10th, National News Agency)</p>
<h3>British, American, and French Representatives Discuss International Issues</h3>
<p>Politics and Economics Cannot Be Separated; Britain Expresses Skepticism About Disarmament</p>
<p>[London] The chief American representative to the World Sugar Conference, Davis, held talks yesterday with the chief French representative, Minister of National Economy Spinasse. Both agreed that there is a close connection between economic and political issues and that the two cannot be resolved separately. In other words, if there is no solution to political issues, economic issues cannot be resolved. The two also discussed armaments issues with British Foreign Secretary Eden, with Eden explaining why Britain is skeptical about the future of arms limitation. As for the delegations from various countries attending the Sugar Conference, most hope that the future of international trade, no matter how difficult, should be granted greater freedom. The United States advocates the establishment of an international agreement to reduce tariffs, while Britain advocates that related countries separately establish mutual agreements. There are considerable differences of opinion between the two sides, and they have not yet reached a consensus. However, the representatives of various countries believe that the main obstacle to international trade is the policy of economic self-sufficiency and limited exchange rate measures pursued by Italy and Germany. Although the issue of American war debts has not yet been mentioned at this time, it will definitely be raised for discussion sooner or later. Since the United States is unwilling to accept any political agreement, the only thing it can cooperate with European countries is to provide loans. Therefore, the issue of war debts will inevitably be raised for discussion later, without any doubt. (10th, Havas Agency)</p>

<h3>Spanish Monitoring Plan</h3>
<p>New Problems Arise</p>
<p>[London] Four British ships, fully loaded with grain, are planning to sail to Bilbao in northern Spain to deliver to the Spanish government army. The area is now almost entirely surrounded by the Nationalist army on both land and sea. The captains of the four ships, currently docked in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, received a telegram this morning from Nationalist leader General Franco, stating that the Nationalist army is determined to prevent grain from entering Bilbao, even if it means clashing with the British Navy. Therefore, a new problem has arisen in Britain's compliance with the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish war, as the British ships are carrying grain, which is not covered by the agreement. However, if the British ships enter Bilbao, the party that receives the grain will certainly benefit greatly. It is expected that these four British ships have requested protection from the British authorities and are temporarily docked in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, awaiting further orders. (10th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Italian Cabinet Passes Colonial Policy</h3>

<h3>Germany Discovers Reactionary Pamphlet</h3>
<p>Signed "The Liberty Party"</p>
<p>[Berlin] Recently, a yellow pamphlet opposing National Socialism has been widely distributed here. It is signed "The German Liberty Party" and outlines the party's political program for domestic and foreign affairs. Regarding domestic affairs: ㊀ Abolish the policy of economic self-sufficiency, which only leads to commercial bankruptcy, butter shortages, and increased bread prices. ㊁ Fight against the trust system. ㊂ Establish a fair social system and freedom of religion; the judiciary must be independent. ㊃ Dissolve the current Reichstag and hold free elections. Regarding foreign affairs: ㊀ Resolve disputes and establish friendly, peaceful relations with France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. ㊁ Stop aiding the Spanish rebels and no longer send Germans to the deserts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the pamphlet states that the German Liberty Party includes people from all social classes in Germany, followers of all religions, and members of all political parties, such as the former German National People's Party, the Democratic Party, and the Socialist Party. Even some members of the National Socialist Party, seeing Germany gradually losing its position in the world and wishing to restore it, have joined the party. "Others, such as Admiral Foerster (former commander of the Baltic Fleet), General Fritz, the commander-in-chief of the Reichswehr, and thousands of officers and millions of people, support the party."

<h3>Another European Royal Discards Honor and Glory</h3>
<p>Romanian Prince Refuses to Abandon Beloved Wife</p>
<p>⊙Bucharest - Prince Nicholas, the brother of the King of Romania, married Mrs. Savulescu, a beautiful Russian woman, in 1931. The royal family has repeatedly urged him to divorce her, but he has consistently refused, preferring to give up his royal position rather than abandon his beloved. Last night, a cabinet meeting was held, chaired by King Carol, to consider the Prince's letter. After lengthy deliberation, it was concluded that the Prince's attitude remains unchanged, and since everyone has their own aspirations, it is not appropriate to force him to comply. It was decided to issue a public statement announcing that Prince Nicholas has relinquished all his titles and royal rights. Nicholas will soon leave the country in a private capacity. Nicholas is currently 33 years old and has held many important positions. His wife is renowned for her beauty and was previously married to Mr. Savulescu, a figure in the Russian diplomatic world. She later divorced and fell in love with Nicholas. She then obtained a marriage certificate from a certain mayor, and a Catholic priest solemnized the marriage, thus becoming husband and wife. Although the royal family declared the marriage invalid and dismissed the mayor from his position, they were ultimately unable to change Nicholas's love for her. (Central News Agency Reuters Telegraph, 10th)</p>
<p>[Vienna] It was learned here today that Prince Nicholas, the brother of the King of Romania, has been stripped of his rank but insists that his wife and four-year-old child still be recognized as royalty.

Each sector was led in groups by their respective leaders, all dressed in uniforms for the audience. All sectors of Guilin organized a public welcome rally and invited the Chairman to give a speech. After the rally, a military parade was held. The Chairman came to inspect. Both the welcome rally site and the parade ground were held at the Great Parade Ground outside the West Gate. The military parade was conducted in accordance with the military parade held on New Year's Day of the Republic of China in 1937. Mo Shujie, commander of the 45th Division, was designated as the parade commander. The aviation school also sent planes to participate at the time. Chairman Lin is scheduled to stay in Guilin for three or four days before returning north. When passing through Hengyang, he will visit Mount Heng, and then return to Changsha and take a steamer back to Nanjing. (April 8th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Boat Illegally Surveys Quanzhou Coast</h3>
<p>Photographing and Surveying the Coast in the Yongning Area - Japanese Ronin are Extremely Active in Various Parts of Southern Jin</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Nationals of a certain country have been immigrating to the interior of southern Fujian in large numbers in recent years, especially along the coast of Quanzhou, and their actions are strange, which has drawn the attention of local political and military authorities and the general public. According to a Quanzhou dispatch on the 7th, the ronin who are active in the interior are centered on the coastal and near-shore areas of Shishi, Jinjing, Yuantou, Tangdong, Shenhu, Yakou, and Yongning outside the South Gate of Quanzhou in Jinjiang County's Third District. A motorboat, resembling a fishing boat, suddenly arrived four li from the coast under the jurisdiction of Tangdong the other day. The boat was equipped with a wireless telegraph. It was reported that it was a special agent from a certain side who came here from Xiamen and had arranged in advance for a dozen leaders of residents in the areas of Shishi, Yakou, Yongning, Jinjing, Shenhu, Tangdong, and Weitou to meet on the boat. After the meeting, the special agents and two other ronin, guided by these resident leaders, photographed and surveyed the coast along Weitou, Tangdong, Shenhu to Yakou and Yongning. Then they went to Shishi together and stayed for several hours before returning to Tangdong, disembarking, and heading to Xiamen. It is noted that the coastal area of Weitou, Tangdong, Yakou, and Yongning in southern Jin is a bay with a wide harbor and deep water. When Quanzhou was a port for foreign transportation and trade during the Sui and Tang dynasties, Yongning and Yakou were ports where foreign ships moored. Several hundred years ago, Yongning was a very prosperous commercial port, and even today there are still ancient sites from the Sui, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. Although the entire town is now in ruins, the grand scale of the market at that time can still be seen. Its historical status in foreign maritime transportation was far earlier than Xiamen, and it is located at the intersection of the shipping lanes from Shanghai to Hong Kong. All sea-going vessels going to Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, India, Europe, and Shanghai must pass the foot of the mountains in the ports of Yongning and Yakou. The mountains between Shishi and Yongning are extremely high and majestic. There is a pagoda called "Guan Suo Ta" on the mountain near the sea, which was built hundreds of years ago and can be seen from 100 to 200 li away by sea-going vessels. Its function is no different from a modern lighthouse, and it is an important military location on the coast. In the early Ming Dynasty, artillery platforms were built in Yongning, and a naval admiral was stationed there, making it an important stronghold on the southern coast of China. To this day, Yongning still has many iron cannons weighing several thousand catties and the ruins of the naval admiral's official residence.</p>
<p>Another dispatch reports that counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of Fujian, Chinese Farmers Bank, and Bank of China have been repeatedly discovered in Shishi, Yakou, Jinjing, and Weitou. A month ago, the Third District Office discovered fifty ten-yuan counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China in Chen Shuangchun's brothel in Weijiang and arrested Chen for prosecution in court. An investigation revealed that the counterfeit banknotes circulating in southern Jin were printed in large quantities by people from a certain side, who secretly sent ronin to bring them to various towns and villages in southern Jin to deceive the general rural population and use the profits as funds for certain activities. The circulation of counterfeit banknotes in southern Jin and the communication agencies of a certain side are all located in the above-mentioned brothels, and there are dedicated personnel in charge, with extremely well-informed news.

<h3>Wuxi Rehabilitation Center Physician Accused of Attempted Rape - Zheng Fuxi's Guilt Established</h3>
<p>Charged with Crimes Under Articles 221 and 134 - Prosecution Filed After Interrogation by District Court Prosecutor</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The case of Zheng Fuxi, a physician at the Wuxi County Rehabilitation Center, attempting to rape a female opium addict named Guo Zixin has caused a sensation and is the talk of the town. All who have blood in their veins are outraged. Since the case was transferred to the judiciary for trial, Prosecutor Ren Guanghai has summoned witnesses and interrogated them several times. Zheng Fuxi's guilt has been established, and a public prosecution was filed yesterday (the 10th). The original text reads:</p>
<p>Defendant Zheng Fuxi, male, 35 years old, from Henan Province, in custody. Regarding the case of the above-mentioned defendant's violation of morals, No. 2148 in 1936, after investigation, this office believes that prosecution is necessary. The facts and the legal articles violated are hereby described below. Zheng Fuxi is the chief physician of the Wuxi County Rehabilitation Center, specializing in medical services and management for male and female opium addicts. Guo Zixin, also known as Hua Jinglan, is a female opium addict who was transferred for testing. On March 5th of this year, which is the 23rd day of the first lunar month, at 4:00 PM, Zheng Fuxi took advantage of the fact that the staff members were working in the office and personally called Guo Zixin to the central room of the staff dormitory, which was very close to the testing room. He began to tease Guo Zixin with words, and then touched her chest and hugged her waist, intending to rape her. Guo Zixin pushed his hand away and returned to her room. Later that night, when it was quiet, Zheng Fuxi personally opened the lock of the main door of the testing room and came to the door of the first room, falsely claiming that the director had something to discuss and strongly invited Guo Zixin to the outside of the main door of the room. He then dragged Guo Zixin into the dark room, pulled at her clothes, and attempted to rape her. Guo Zixin wanted to shout, but he covered her mouth, but she still insisted on refusing. Zheng Fuxi, fearing exposure, allowed her to return to her room. Afterwards, Guo Zixin reported the matter to the Second District Security Command of Jiangsu Province, which sent a letter to various places for investigation. After summoning a number of witnesses and interrogating them separately several times, Zheng Fuxi steadfastly refused to confess. However, an investigation into how he actually attempted the rape revealed that not only did the plaintiff, Guo Zixin, point out the circumstances in detail, but witnesses such as Zhou Zhang, Zhou Yin, Wang Sun, Wang Lu, Wang Zhou, and Fan Zhou all testified that it was true. Furthermore, Guo Zixin was taken to the center for inspection, and her previous statements were consistent. It is clear that Zheng Fuxi abused his official power to rape Guo Zixin with violence and coercion. There is no room for him to prevaricate. His actions constitute a crime under Article 221, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and should be punished under Article 221, Paragraph 2 and Article 134 of the same law. Prosecution is hereby filed in accordance with the law. (The rest omitted)</p>
<h3>Changshu - Minister Wang Inspects Changshu</h3>
<p>Minister of Justice Wang Yongbin's inspection of the judicial systems of various counties in southern and northern Jiangsu was originally scheduled to arrive in Changshu first. However, due to the convenience of the itinerary, he first arrived in Zhenjiang and then in Yangzhou and other counties. Now that the inspection of the various counties in northern Jiangsu has been completed, he crossed the Yangtze River from Nantong by car on the 10th and arrived in Changshu in the afternoon. Those traveling with him included Wei Datong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Liao Weixun, Section Chief of the Prison Department.

<h3>Changzhou - Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce Resigns</h3>
<p>Jiang Weixian, Chairman of the Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce, previously held a position in the Ministry of Finance and was also the Supervisor of Yangyou Customs. In recent years, he has been involved in local industries. During the re-election of the County Chamber of Commerce last year, he was unanimously elected as chairman and has been enthusiastic in his service, which is loved by all industries. Recently, Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, hired him as an economic commissioner and requires him to be stationed in Shanghai for service. He specifically submitted a letter of resignation from the position of Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce on the 9th. The County Chamber of Commerce has convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to discuss the matter. It is expected that a new chairman will have to be elected to succeed him.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang - Opium Addicts Perform Labor Service</h3>
<p>In order to improve the physical fitness of opium addicts, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specifically launched a labor service program for opium addicts and instructed various counties to comply and implement it. After receiving the order, Zhang Qingyuan, the Magistrate of Zhenjiang County, has actively launched a road construction project, named the Anti-Opium Road, starting from the Lao Beimen on Zhongshan Road to behind Zhenjiang Normal School. The work has been very intense in recent days, and it is expected that it can be completed in its entirety next week. Then, afforestation and river dredging will be carried out at Sibaidu, because water is difficult to obtain there, and there are frequent droughts. Therefore, it is planned to dig a large pond for irrigating farmland. It is also reported that there are more than 280 opium addicts performing labor service, most of whom are serving seven to eight months of imprisonment. It is said that opium addicts who have received heavy sentences cannot perform labor service without long-term reform.</p>
<p>Construction of Zhongzheng Wharf</p>
<p>In order to complete the Zhenjiang port plan, the Jiangsu Construction Department decided to build the Zhongzheng Wharf in the provincial capital. The bidding for the steel and reinforced concrete bridge and management office building projects has been carried out. The public bidding was held at 3:00 PM on March 22nd in the assembly hall of the Construction Department. It is reported that six construction companies, including Xinyi, participated. The provincial government sent a special commissioner to supervise and carefully review the bids. After careful examination, it was decided to award the bid to Xinyi Construction Company. The Construction Department has announced the decision yesterday, limiting the company to come to the department within one day to sign the contract.</p>
<h3>Nantong - Wang Yongbin Inspects Nantong</h3>
<p>Wang Yongbin, the Minister of Justice, accompanied by Wei Datong, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Liao Weixun, the Section Chief, and a party of eight, arrived in Nantong by car from Rugao at 6:00 PM on the 9th and stayed at the Nantong Club Hotel. On the 10th, they inspected the local court, Jiangsu Fourth Prison, and toured Wolf Mountain. That night, they went to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yellow Croaker Season Has Arrived</h3>
<p>The fishing areas along the coast of Tong, including Shengsi and Dongsha, have now reached the peak season for yellow croaker. The situation this year is better than in previous years. There are as many as 12,000 fishing boats catching fish on the ocean surface. The police warships of the water police escort fleet have all set sail on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou - Seven Bandits Captured, Four Robbery Cases Solved</h3>
<p>Liu Zonghan, the captain of the detective team of the Jiangdu County Police Bureau, previously sent detective Hu Keyin, along with more than a dozen detectives including Zhai Jingwu, to Gaoyou and Zhaoguan Dam in the Seventh District to search for bandits. Currently, they have successively captured bandit criminals Jia Yintang, Zhang Guoxiang, Mao Tongfu, Yang Zongshui, Zhao Dianxue, Tang Dashi Zi, and Chen Zhengshou, as well as a box gun and a rifle (Gaoyou County stamped number ○○○78). They brought the team to interrogate many pieces of stolen goods and confessed to two robberies on Wulimiao Road in this county, robberies of help boats on Lujin, the robbery case of Zhixiang Sauce Garden outside the South Gate, and many robberies in the territory of Gaoyou County. They were escorted to the police station for interrogation on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing - Deadline for Payment of Seed Money</h3>
<p>Since spring silkworms are about to be cultivated in the Jiaxing County Sericulture Improvement District, all seed quantities have also been allocated. Since the seed money must now be collected in order to issue the seeds, the Improvement District has entrusted farmers and various offices to collect the seed money on its behalf for convenience. All unpaid seed money in various places must be paid in full to the originally designated location before the 15th of this month. If the deadline is exceeded, it will be disposed of separately. In addition, since more than 256,000 sheets of spring seeds have been determined for this year, the Silkworm Seed Association has only issued 200,000 sheets of seeds, a significant shortage. Therefore, it has been decided that those who ordered seeds before June 25, 1936, will be allowed to issue the specified brand in full, and those who ordered seeds after June 25 will be required to issue 72% of the specified number and must be mixed with other seeds.</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Scenery Along the Chengdu-Chongqing Road</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>Sichuan’s scenery is uniquely beautiful and its products are abundant and fine. There are truly countless places worth visiting. The Dujiangyan Irrigation System in Guan County has the most impressive water conservancy in the entire country. The Ziliujing wells in Fushun can naturally produce salt water and fire, and they are a special feature that embellishes the “Land of Abundance.” Someone said, “If you haven’t traveled to Mount Emei, you haven’t been to Sichuan.” I, however, think that “If you haven’t seen Dujiangyan and Ziliujing, even if you have traveled to Mount Emei, you haven’t been to Sichuan.” The reason is simple: “Emei is the most beautiful place under heaven” is an old saying. In reality, are there not more mountains and waters in the world that are worthy of being called “outstandingly beautiful” than just Mount Emei? Only Dujiangyan and Ziliujing, especially Ziliujing, are truly impossible to find anywhere else. Moreover, Ziliujing can produce more than 2.8 million dan of salt each year, and the Dujiangyan Irrigation System irrigates fourteen counties. They are truly a lifeline in Sichuan’s public and private economy! That is why I say, “If you haven’t seen Dujiangyan and Ziliujing, you haven’t been to Sichuan.”</p>
<p>Dujiangyan is north of Chengdu, reachable by car in a day. Ziliujing is south of Chengdu. If you take a car along the Chengdu-Chongqing Road, you can reach Neijiang in exactly one day. The second day, you will have to take a sedan chair for 130 li to reach it. I took advantage of the opportunity to see Ziliujing first, so I abandoned the near for the far.</p>
<p>The Chengdu-Chongqing Road is the ancestor of Sichuan’s highways. It already has more than twenty years of history. The route is very long. The starting and ending stations are the two major cities of Chengdu and Chongqing. There are also many prosperous counties and towns along the way, so business is very developed. There are four or five buses departing in each direction every day, with Neijiang as the overnight stop. Travelers can arrive at their destination on alternating days. Passengers must take a numbered ticket according to the order in which they arrived to determine their seat, and then wait for the bell to ring before buying a ticket and boarding the bus. The procedure is similar to registering at a large hospital in Beijing and Shanghai, so order is fairly well maintained, although it adds the trouble of registering.</p>
<p>The car first drove a long way through the Chengdu plains. Everywhere there were green fields and gentle breezes, and sunshine. Passing through many large and small towns, one often saw many strong men with untidy clothes, standing in rows on the threshing grounds during their agricultural off-season, posing with “one, two, three,” “one, two, three” preparatory stances. Probably to avoid the glare of the morning sun, their gun muzzles were all aimed directly north.</p>
<p>Traveling through the Longquanyi Mountains, the ridges were high and steep, and the road was winding and twisting, like the Liupanshan Mountains on the Xi’an-Lanzhou Road and the Xianxia Ridge on the Zhejiang-Fujian Road. Drivers and passengers were all very cautious. According to a merchant from Beijing, “The most dangerous places have never had any accidents; the easier places to drive, especially when crossing high mountains and about to reach the plains, sometimes have unfortunate events.” This is an actual proof of the philosophy of “born in sorrow, die in peace.” When the car reached the high ridges, looking around, the mountainous areas were planted with red and white sweet potatoes, and it was the time for harvesting. The sweet potatoes were piled up in the corners of the fields, looking like gold and silver. In the lower-lying areas, even in the paddy fields, there were still unharvested sugar canes, with the upper shoots as green as spring seedlings and the lower parts as brown and yellow as autumn chestnuts. Also, interspersed among the fields were some orange groves, yellow fruits, Buddha’s hands, mountain green vegetables, rapeseed flowers, and fertile broad beans and wheat, all of which were very pleasing to the eye. North of the Yellow River, around the Winter Solstice, all vegetables and fruits have to be stored in cellars, or they will freeze. But in Sichuan, even though it is late winter, the earth does not easily shed its beautiful green coat. Such a mild climate and fertile soil are so lovely!</p>
<p>The first county seat passed after descending the slope is called Jianyang. The city wall was demolished and then rebuilt. This was because they first wanted to facilitate transportation, and then they needed to defend against the “Red Bandits.” Later, in the Ziyang County territory, at a place where the road turned around a mountain, there were several slogans for revitalizing the nation painted on a man-made cut rock face, including “Eradicate bandits and never forget to resist ×,” which had already been painted over with a layer of white powder. Zizhong County town is backed by mountains and faces the water, with clear and secluded scenery. Together with Jianyang upstream and Neijiang downstream, they are prosperous cities in the Tuo River basin that are “like paintings.”</p>
<p>Students from Zizhong Middle School were collecting donations at the station, first handing out a “Consolation Donation Appeal for Soldiers at the Front in Suidong,” which included phrases such as “If Suidong is not lost, the nation will not perish,” “If the soldiers in Suidong are saved, Suidong will be saved,” and “Students are donating by economizing on food and are appealing to patriotic people from all walks of life for donations.” Their attitude was extremely sincere and their words were extremely touching. Therefore, most of the travelers, covered in dust from their journey, enthusiastically donated. Among the passengers in the same car was an illiterate woman who, after hearing the explanation, asked someone to write on her behalf and generously opened her purse. A civil servant wearing a badge pinned a number on the donation book: “Please collect and directly remit to General Fu Zuoyi in Suidong. Do not let other intermediary organizations handle it. Absolutely, absolutely (meaning please be sure to do so)!” The reporter asked the reason, and it turned out that Chengdu had previously raised a patriotic donation of more than 20,000 yuan, which was deducted after being remitted to a certain organization. Although the donors were unwilling, they were helpless. Therefore, this time everyone demanded direct remittance to the front lines.</p>
<p>Arriving in Neijiang in the evening, the sky suddenly darkened, and the streetlights were already lit. The rugged and undulating mountains and the clear stream gently embracing the city, shrouded in gray twilight, further highlighted a beautiful picture of deep seclusion and serenity. The Tuo River winds through the territory with great concentration. Often, a dozen miles of land travel would still fall short of the distance by boat in a single day. Li Pu’s lines, “Traveling along the mountain, it always converges; the water flows away and returns again,” and Li Bai’s famous lines, “Green mountains lie across the northern outskirts; white water circles the eastern city,” are descriptive of the city’s scenery.</p>
<p>After dinner, I went out of the inn to visit. The passersby on the road were numerous. Under the bright lights, most of the shops were still open for night markets. Sedan chair carriers and porters who had traveled thousands of miles were also constantly going to inns with red paper lanterns that read “Gentlemen dismount.” Sichuan Province has now implemented a phased ban on opium, scheduled to reduce the opium-growing counties to only four by 1937, and to completely ban it by 1941. Neijiang has a public opium paste shop. At this moment, it is when the common black-listed people are "paying tribute" to them. The business is even more prosperous than the movie theater in a nearby temple. Teahouses and taverns are as numerous as in Chengdu. Every wall has a sign that says "Do not discuss state affairs," which is very eye-catching.</p>

<h3>More Than One Hundred Trade Associations in the City Jointly Telegraph to Request the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry and other 173 trade associations in the city jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, striving to abolish consular jurisdiction. The original telegram read: "To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: In the past, during the late Qing Dynasty, foreign aggression was frequent. The Treaty of Tianjin was a forced agreement, resulting in the establishment of consular jurisdiction. At that time, Chinese and foreign laws and customs differed, and foreign countries could use the excuse of protecting their nationals. However, abuses arose thereafter. For decades, our industries have suffered repression without being able to complain, swallowing our voices and shedding tears. The rivers and waters mourn. Every time we read the Prime Minister's will, the phrase 'abolish unequal treaties' never fails to remind us of this. We only hope that by thoroughly implementing this principle, we must first reflect on ourselves. Now that the country is unified and laws and politics are on the right track, our benevolent and peaceful Chinese nation can treat everyone equally, without bias. Any nation that treats us equally should respect our country's national system, resolutely give up its privileges, and never follow the old ways, clinging to power and isolating itself, still clinging to the old wisdom of the 19th century. Otherwise, as trends shift, we should declare its abolition. It is also a universal principle. Your Excellency has been in diplomatic circles for a long time and has recently been entrusted with important responsibilities. The world admires you for your diplomacy, politics, and law. You should take steps without needing suggestions. We hope to achieve abolition in the shortest possible time. We offer our sincere prayers. It is not only our hundred or so trade associations. In urgent telegram, we eagerly await good news. The Shanghai Silk Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Paper Industry, New Medicine Industry, Woolen Industry, Timber Industry, Pharmaceutical Industry, and other 173 trade associations bow. [Steaming]."</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the formalities, Chairman Tao Changshan announced: "Today is the third principal repayment drawing of the Series C bonds of the 25th Year of the Republic Consolidated Public Bonds and the 16th principal repayment drawing of the Haihe River Engineering Short-Term Public Bonds of Hebei Province. The drawing methods are as follows: for the Series C bonds of the Consolidated Public Bonds, the last three digits of the number will be used; for the Haihe Public Bonds, the last two digits of the number will be used.

<h3>Guangdong Associations in Shanghai Explain Tax Exemption on Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Declaration Issued</p>
<p>The rice shortage in Guangdong Province this time is unprecedented. The central government, understanding the actual situation, granted a tax exemption on two million piculs of foreign rice, effective from April 1st. Subsequently, many rice merchants in the country, not fully understanding the difficult situation in Guangdong, repeatedly petitioned in Beijing to maintain national taxes. Guangdong compatriots in Shanghai have issued a declaration to explain to all sectors of society. The original text is as follows: "Guangdong is a province with limited land and a dense population, with more mountains than fields, and its food production is insufficient to meet its own needs. It has always relied on foreign rice for assistance. Last year, frequent disasters and a poor late harvest, coupled with the interruption of foreign rice sources, led to an unprecedented rice shortage. Rice was as expensive as pearls, and the roads were filled with starving people. The central government, concerned about the people's suffering, adopted a method of allowing a limited amount of foreign rice to be transported to Guangdong with tax exemptions, providing some relief. However, before the people could catch their breath, the quota was exhausted, and the food panic resurfaced. In addition, some took the opportunity to profit, hoarding and speculating, causing grain prices to soar, and the people's suffering became even more intense. Officials and people in Guangdong repeatedly appealed, and the central government, understanding the actual situation, resolutely approved one million piculs of foreign rice and grain each to be used for regulation. This is a contingency plan that takes into account the overall situation and weighs the pros and cons, and it is also an urgent task to alleviate the rice shortage in Guangdong. It is regrettable that rice merchants from other provinces did not understand and opposed it en masse. It is not known that food is different from other goods and should not only consider the interests of production but also consider the interests of consumption. Guangdong's rice production is already insufficient to meet its own needs in normal times. In this year of famine, rice prices are more expensive than in other provinces. The people of Guangdong only seek to stabilize rice prices slightly to maintain their lives and have a full meal of congee, and they have no other demands. They are not willing to import foreign rice to increase the country's tax revenue loss. However, in this year of famine, starving people are crying for food and are looking to neighboring rice to provide assistance. It is feared that it will be difficult to quickly alleviate Guangdong's urgent needs. Moreover, according to the Guangdong People's Food Association's investigation and statistics, the surplus from the four provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hubei is not enough to support Guangdong's food shortage. Even if it is only enough to make up for the shortage, the transportation is difficult, the transportation costs are high, and the cost is relatively high, so the selling price will be expensive. If there is no tax-exempt foreign rice import, there will be no way to stabilize the rice price. That is, our farmers in Guangdong will not be able to overcome this difficult situation, and the rural areas will go bankrupt beyond redemption. Guangdong is a part of the whole country, and the entire rural economy of the country should also be taken into consideration. Some say that one yuan of Guangdong small money can buy seven catties of rice, which, when converted into national currency, is not much different from the rice price in Shanghai, and there is no need to stabilize the rice price. It must be known that the income of Guangdong people in Guangdong is all in small money, and the rice price should not be determined by converting it into national currency. Furthermore, Guangdong is the source of the revolution and bears the heaviest burden and the greatest sacrifices. It has never lagged behind in matters that benefit the country and the nation. If it is not absolutely necessary to transport a tax-exempt foreign rice quota to Guangdong to stabilize the rice price and alleviate the people's difficulties, how dare we constantly argue? Moreover, Guangdong has previously borne tens of millions of revolutionary public bonds, and is still awaiting settlement. Even during the Northern Expedition, the people of Guangdong were happy to contribute to the national military expenditure, and there was no objection. The intangible and tangible supply and sacrifice are even more numerous. Even after the success of the Northern Expedition, the intangible and tangible sacrifices of the people of Guangdong are still equal under special circumstances. The central government should consider the previous labor and give consideration and comfort. Our associations, residing in Shanghai, are doubly concerned about the interests of our hometown. We dare to exhaustively state the hardships of the people of Guangdong to inform the people of the country. We hope that all sectors of society will understand. This is our declaration for your public consideration."</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Cotton Mill Association Return to Shanghai from Beijing</h3>
<p>Reports to Various Factories Will be Made Within Days</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance intends to increase the unified tax on cotton yarn. The National Association of Chinese Cotton Mills believes that it is difficult to maintain due to the impact of foreign goods dumping on domestic cotton yarn and flowers. Therefore, it has dispatched representatives Guo Shun, Zhang Zemin, Liu Jingji, and other representatives from various regions to Beijing to request the Executive Yuan, the Central Political Committee, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to exempt them from implementation to maintain commercial difficulties. The matter has been completed. Except for Mr. Guo, who needs to attend the founding meeting of the National Goods Intermodal Transportation Company and stay in Beijing, Zhang and Liu have taken the train from Beijing to Shanghai and plan to report the progress of the petition to various factories within days.</p>
<h3>Mr. Lanke Talks About the Reasons for High Paper Prices</h3>
<p>Paper Shortage is Inevitable in the Future</p>
<p>The Dalu News reported that the White Star Line's round-the-world cruise ship, the Franconia, arrived in Shanghai on Friday (9th) morning with 365 passengers from New York. It sailed to Qinhuangdao at 7:30 the following morning (10th). Mr. Lanke, general manager of the Crystal Wood Paper Company in Middletown, Ohio, USA, was also one of the passengers. He talked about the world paper market with a reporter from the Dalu News at the Cathay Hotel. According to him, the recent surge in paper prices is mainly due to the war preparations of European countries and the development of the rayon industry. The paper pulp used by munitions factories in the past year has doubled compared to the past, and it is still being absorbed in large quantities, causing paper mills in Europe and the United States to feel a shortage of raw materials. However, it would not be a problem if rayon factories did not compete to purchase it. Sulfite pulp is used for papermaking, and rayon also uses this raw material. In recent years, the production of rayon in the United States and the rest of the world has increased year by year, and the impact on the paper industry is not difficult to imagine. When the reporter asked whether the world would suffer from a paper shortage, Mr. Lanke replied that it might be inevitable. He also said that paper prices are still rising recently, and some American newspapers are already suffering from a shortage of newsprint. Paper mills are now not accepting orders with fixed prices for half a year or a whole year in order to prevent prices from continuing to rise. All orders can only be priced 30 days before shipment. Mr. Lanke finally said that the sales of wood paper are now more prosperous than before. Although his factory is large, the output is still in short supply. At present, the uses of wood paper are so many that ordinary people cannot imagine it. Mr. Lanke and his wife took a plane to Peiping on Saturday morning.</p>

It is clear that the consul has no reason to shelter smugglers of his own country. According to an investigation by someone in this city, from October 24 to March of this year, the customs has cracked 16 cases of Japanese people smuggling silver coins, copper coins, and prohibited items for export and import. All of them were released by the Japanese consulate without being sent to the customs for punishment according to the treaty. Now, we have recorded the causes of the cases and request your ministry to examine and approve them, and forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the ambassador of that country stationed in Beijing, and request him to strictly order the consulate not to protect them. This is in the public interest. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce kowtows, Qing."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Tax Exemption for Foreign Rice Transported to Guangdong by Charitable Organizations</h3>
<p>Explanation of Reasons</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting that the tax exemption on foreign rice imports be stopped. Yesterday, it received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, which said, "To the Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association, the telegram has been received. The fundamental solution to the rice shortage in Guangdong Province depends entirely on the large-scale transport of domestic rice for assistance. The Ministry is now supervising the Food Transportation and Marketing Bureau and the authorities of the rice-producing provinces to discuss practical and effective methods. Before domestic rice can be fully transported, the tax-exempt import of foreign rice and grain is temporarily approved to provide relief to the people's food during the transition period in Guangdong Province. There are restrictions on the quantity and import date, and all management and distribution are the responsibility of the Guangdong Provincial Food Regulation Committee. This is a comprehensive consideration of the sales of domestic rice in Guangdong. The tax-exempt import of foreign grain and rice has been approved from April 1st to August 31st of this year as the implementation period, and the Shanhaiguan Customs has been ordered to comply. In addition to the Ministry's telegram to Director Yu and the Guangdong Provincial Government ordering the Food Regulation Committee to properly allocate and supervise the supply and demand of rice and grain to ensure that rice prices are regulated and stable and do not hinder the rice market, the Ministry of Industry and this Ministry have ordered the Agricultural and Commercial Bank and the Food Transportation and Marketing Bureau to jointly investigate the quantity and circulation of domestic rice stocks to seek to regulate the production and sales of domestic rice. This is a reply by telegram for your information. Sincerely, Ministry of Finance."</p>

<h3>Shipping Costs Soar</h3>
<p>Recently, domestic and foreign commodity prices have soared, and all daily necessities such as rubber, galvanized iron, rice, and cotton have been rising. In addition, the main raw materials used in the construction and repair of ships and in the operation, such as steel, hardware, materials, and coal, have more demand than supply, and countries are vying to purchase them, resulting in a situation where it is difficult to meet the urgent need. The price increase is also a phenomenon that has not been seen in recent years, and the situation is similar to the eve of the European War. Therefore, the construction cost of ships has increased accordingly, which is about half as high as a year ago. However, the freight rates of various shipping companies are still the same as before, and the cost is far less than the low level of the past. They are trying to balance income and expenditure, and although they are trying their best to reduce expenses, they are unable to make up for it and are worried about it. Therefore, there are not a few ships currently in China that cannot be maintained and are leaving for other places. The freight rates in China remain the same, while the freight rates abroad have already increased, so they avoid the cheap and go for the expensive to offset the cost. Recently, the freight rate from Saigon to Hong Kong has increased from 8 cents to 38 cents to 40 cents per catty of goods, setting a new record in recent years. There are also several ocean-going ships that were previously outdated and no one cared about, forcing them to stop sailing. Recently, due to the large number of ships leaving China, the number of ships has been sharply reduced, and the freight volume has increased. The supply and demand are disparate, so there are those who are willing to lease and operate them at the highest rental price after the European War. The tense situation can be seen in general. Currently, a part of the ships in the shipping industry have gone to distant places to find other paths because the local freight rates are not enough to cover the costs. The total number of ships has decreased, while the cargo transportation along the coast of the Yangtze River has increased due to the active market conditions and economic recovery. Although they are trying their best to transport it, there is still a situation where the supply cannot meet the demand. Although they are trying to maintain and repair the original ships or allocate funds to build new ships, they are unable to realize them due to the sharp increase in repair and construction costs and the excessive cost. They are currently working together to find remedies to balance supply and demand, maintain income and expenditure, and overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<h3>Record of the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of Nanyang Tobacco Company</h3>

At 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, the meeting was held at the headquarters on Dongxi Huade Road. The number of shares present totaled 444,409 shares and 222,850 voting rights. The managing director, Mr. Lao Jingxiu, represented the chairman, held the opening ceremony, and stated the purpose of amending the articles of association. Then, Mr. Liang Xiangshu read the draft amendment to the articles of association item by item, and the shareholders discussed it with each other. Then, it was voted by voting method. Mr. Zhou Qingquan and other shareholders publicly elected Zhang Bingrong and Tan Boji as tellers, and Mr. Zhang Bingrong and others publicly elected Liang Ziyu and Zhou Qingquan as scrutineers. As a result of the vote, all 222,850 voting rights were passed. However, the number of people present on that day did not exceed half of the total number of shareholders. According to the company law, it should first be regarded as a temporary resolution, and the temporary resolution should be notified to the shareholders, and a second extraordinary general meeting of shareholders should be convened half a month later to decide. In addition, April 27 is the date of the 17th annual general meeting of shareholders of the company, and the second extraordinary general meeting of shareholders for amending the articles of association is planned to be held on the same day to promote it.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Public Bus Company Held Annual General Meeting of Shareholders Yesterday</h3>
<p>Due to the Situation and Increased Mileage, a Loss of More Than 16,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company held its ninth annual general meeting of shareholders yesterday. 3,875 shares were present, exceeding the legal quorum. Xiao Hechang, a representative of the Public Utilities Bureau, performed the ceremony as usual. First, Huang Zhongwen, chairman and general manager of the company, reported on the operating statistics for 1936, stating that the mileage was 2,336,448 kilometers, an increase of 91,539 kilometers over the previous year. The number of passengers was 4,002,654. The average number of passengers per 100 seats on each line was 26.5 on Jiangwan Line 1, 49.2 on Zhenru Line 3, 52.3 on Municipal Government Line 4, 4.85 on Municipal Dormitory Line 5, and 19.4 on Yangshupu to Water and Electricity Plant Line 6, with an average of 42.9. Fuel consumption was about 20,000 yuan less than last year, but the result was still a loss of 16,810.46 yuan, and a small amount was allocated to the next year's account. After the final settlement, the Social Affairs Bureau approved a year-end bonus of 15 days for the workers, totaling more than 3,000 yuan. The company's losses were mainly due to the increased mileage and the influence of the relocation of residents due to the Japanese sailors on Douloan Road and Haining Road. Secondly, it was affected by the increase in gasoline prices, but this year's business has slightly improved. For example, the completion of the Qiujiang Wharf has made progress more promising. Then, it was resolved to divide the previously determined capital increase of 100,000 yuan into two times and submit it to the Ministry of Industry for registration. After the voting election, Huang Zhongwen, Wu Hongshu, Zhang Jinfeng, Situ Liting, Shi Tifen, Huang Zetang, Tan Yichuang, Huang Jianxun, and Zhang Bingrong were elected as directors, and Liang Bingyuan was elected as supervisor.</p>

<h3>Police Officer Sends Note During Robbery Trial Awaiting Interrogation</h3>
<p>French Police Officer Demonstrates the Process</p>
<p>Sun Penghuan, a judge of the Second Special District Court of the French Concession, tried the case of the robbery of the property of Jiang Wangshi's family at No. 4 Shoulu Lane, Dongxinqiao Street (robbed on the evening of September 9 of last year) in the criminal court at 3 p.m. on the 9th. The robbers Tian Linchang, Wang Acai, Yang Changgen, and Guo Hongqing, (owner of the Shengchang vegetable shop in Hongkou), and Xu Chunde, etc., testified that Guo instigated the robbery and that Guo and Xu provided the guns. Guo and Xu denied the matter. Wang Acai insisted that Guo instigated the robbery and that today when they were detained in the waiting room, a police officer brought in a note and gave it to Guo Hongqing, telling Guo to present rebuttal evidence, saying that he went to Changshu on September 7 of last year and stayed at the China Hotel. After reading the note, Guo tore the paper into pieces, stuffed it into his mouth, chewed it, spit it out, and threw it out of the window, saying that it could be found now. After verifying the confession in court, he ordered two bailiffs to take Wang Acai outside the window of the waiting room. They found several pieces of torn paper, which were presented to the court. After the court examined the paper and pieced it together, there were words such as "Changshu China Hotel." Guo still flatly denied it. After the adjournment, Judge Sun reported to the president of the court and ordered judicial police officers to investigate. The police officers immediately investigated at about 5 p.m. the day before. They inquired with the guard in front of the first court, who confirmed that a certain police officer had entered the first court. The police officers also summoned the bailiffs on duty in the first court that day and ordered them to demonstrate the situation of their service and guarding of the waiting room door that day. They then notified the police station to detain the Chinese police officer. Yesterday morning, Clerk Diao investigated. The police station also took the robber Wang Acai and others who reported the case to the police station for questioning. Once the investigation is completed, they will be prosecuted according to law.</p>

<h3>Girl Sues Her Mother for Disagreeing on Marriage</h3>
<p>Judge Liao Admonishes Both Parties, Declares the Mother Not Guilty in Court</p>
<p>Xu Zhiqing, a lacquer worker from Suzhou, resides at No. 59 Changyu Lane, Julai Road, French Concession. He is over forty years old. His wife, Yang, is forty-two years old. They have a daughter named Huiying, who is sixteen years old this year, but actually fifteen years old and not yet of age. She is beautiful and has not yet been betrothed. Recently, someone introduced a Mr. Chen, a 45-year-old clerk at Jardine Matheson, who intends to take a concubine. Huiying's mother, Xu Yang, planned to marry Huiying to Chen and sought her daughter's consent. The daughter opposed it because another Mr. Yang was currently in the process of proposing marriage. She also rejected it because Chen was old. Yang was unhappy because her daughter refused. On the evening of the 8th, Huiying suddenly went out and did not return until late at night. Her mother asked where she had gone. The daughter said that she went to her little sister's house on Nanjing Road. Mother and daughter quarreled, and the mother used a bamboo ruler to hit the daughter several times. The daughter resented this and on the afternoon of the 9th, she deceived her mother, Yang, into going out to see a movie. She tricked her into going to the law office of Mr. Ye Xiaobiao at No. 454 Nanjing Road, and then commissioned Mr. Ye to file a lawsuit. Mr. Ye then accompanied Yang and Yang Huiying to the French police station to report that her mother, Xu Yang, had caused harm. The police captain found a wound on the daughter's head and sent investigators to investigate. A bamboo ruler was confiscated. Yesterday, Xu Yang was sent to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Liao Zhen heard the case. The Police Department's lawyer stated the case and prosecuted it according to Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The defendant, Xu Yang, hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to defend her. After the court heard the case, it reprimanded the daughter for treating marriage as a major event that can be discussed, and that she could not rashly accuse her mother because she was beaten, which was inappropriate. It also rebuked Yang, saying that her daughter's marriage could be discussed at length and could not be forced. After the debate, it was declared concluded. In court, Xu Yang was declared not guilty and released in court. A lawsuit between mother and daughter over marriage came to an end.</p>

<h3>Resolution of Fish Market Staff Reduction Problem</h3>
<p>The Market Pays Three Months' Severance Pay and Issues a Certificate of Diligent Service</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry was previously ordered by the Ministry to downsize and lay off 69 employees.

<p>Satisfactory Resolution</p>

The dismissed colleagues were deeply aware of the market's difficulties, so they expressed satisfaction. Yesterday, they received their severance pay from the market. At the same time, because the dismissed employees had been working in the market since its opening and had always been diligent and conscientious in their work, the market issued each person a certificate of diligent service as a token of appreciation. Yesterday morning, the dismissed colleagues took a farewell photo at the market as a souvenir.</p>
<p>Notice to Collect Funds</p>
<p>In addition to the majority of dismissed employees who have already received their dismissal pay, a small number of colleagues have not received it because they are scattered in other places.

All dismissed employees who have not yet received their severance pay can quickly contact the representative group's office within today (at the latest by tomorrow morning) to complete the procedures for collecting the funds.</p>

As they were about to flee, shop assistant Chen Jinqing sneaked out through the back door and reported to the Huabu police at 678 Sandoutou, who went to arrest one of the bandits, Zhou Youqing from Tongzhou. Twenty-one yuan and seven jiao in stolen money were found on him. The other bandit escaped in the original car. The captured bandit was taken to the Chengdu Road police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him according to Article 328, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, charging him with robbery. He also stated the case, saying that according to the defendant Zhou Youqing's confession at the police station, he and the fugitive Sun Atang went to rob the shop together. Sun had previously stolen a car on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession. Sun also had a pistol and two bullets. They then went to rob the candle shop. Sun lived at 1 Hexing Lane, Julai Road, in the French Concession. The police went to arrest him based on the confession, but Sun had already fled. It was also found that car number 3013 belonged to Mr. Shachengdun, a foreign teacher at Gezhi Public School. After it was stolen, he had reported it to the police. Later, the car was found near Wuding Road and Maigen Road. Because the accomplice was on the run and the police had not yet fully investigated, the case should be adjourned. Following this, Dai Xixiong, the manager of Dingxiangzhai Candle Shop, and shop assistant Chen Jinqing, filed reports to prove the robbery. Judge Huang Risheng examined the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained and the case adjourned until the morning of the 17th for further investigation.</p>

<h3>A Sister-in-Law Sues Her Two Brothers-in-Law, the Shen Family</h3>
<p>Both Parties Absent; Court Adjourns for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Shen Wei, a 34-year-old Suzhou woman residing at 2 Lanfa Lane, Zhaojiabang Road, Ximen Nei, filed a lawsuit with the District Court against her husband's elder brothers, Shen Xixian (residing at 82 Lane 8, Zhuangjia Street, Lao Ximen) and Shen Xizhou (residing at 41 Changsheng Lane, Chuanxin Street, Lao Beimen), for seizing her inheritance and malicious abandonment. She stated that her late husband, Shen Xide, also known as Chengxian, unfortunately passed away last April. All the houses on Lanfa Lane, Zhaojiabang Road, which were jointly owned by the defendants, together with the land area of 1 mu, 8 fen, 3 li, and 9 hao, and the 8 mu, 4 fen, and 4 hao of burial land, had been managed by the defendants without division. Since the plaintiff's husband passed away, to avoid future disputes, she had petitioned the court for mediation, requesting a division of the property. However, the defendants suddenly objected, falsely claiming that the Shen family's property had already been divided and that they were independent. They did not agree with the plaintiff's claim and intended to seize the rights to which the plaintiff was entitled. After her husband's death, they had agreed to pay 30 yuan per month, but this was also refused. Therefore, she requested that they be punished under Article 294, Section 1, and Article 335, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Ren held a hearing, but the plaintiff did not appear. Attorney Zhang Zhiguo appeared in court to state the background of the case. The defendants also did not appear, but were represented by an attorney. The judge stated that without the plaintiff and defendants present, the court could not investigate the facts of the case and adjourned the hearing, ordering both parties to appear for a further hearing.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall that Opens and Closes Irregularly Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>Lawsuit over Guarantee Deposit; Why is Gambling Allowed Upstairs?</p>
<p>Xiao Chunyuan, a native of Zhenjiang residing at 35 Sanxin Lane, Tangshan Road, and a Japanese man named Bing Teng, jointly opened the Dongfang Dance Hall near the Yokobama Bridge on Sichuan Road in this city. Xiao served as the manager. With the introduction of Li Aru, He Abao, and Jing Fang Atu, they contracted the position of the dance hall's "Xizai Tou" (head of the waiters). Xiao then made a contract with them, stipulating a guarantee deposit of 650 yuan. On December 29th of last year, they first paid 400 yuan in cash and 50 yuan in Zhuang tickets (bank drafts). However, the receipt issued by Xiao stated that the remaining amount of 250 yuan was to be paid within 14 days, failing which the 400 yuan already paid would be forfeited. However, when Li Aru and others went to work, they discovered that it was not a formal dance hall and that there were gambling tables upstairs. Therefore, they did not want to accept the contract and demanded the return of the 400 yuan guarantee deposit. Xiao refused to pay and insisted on the 14-day deadline, stating that if the remaining 250 yuan was not paid, the 400 yuan would be confiscated. In desperation, Li Aru and others filed a complaint with the District Court. Prosecutor Wang Jiamei investigated and found that the dance hall had not obtained a business license and that it opened and closed irregularly, clearly indicating fraud. Therefore, he filed a public prosecution under Article 339, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Bai Dongling held a hearing. The defendant hired attorney Zhang Fukang to defend him, claiming that the case was purely a civil dispute and requesting a verdict of not guilty. The court adjourned the debate and set the verdict for the 15th.</p>
<h3>Arrest Warrant Approved for Mo Jinsong in Dance Hall Indecency Case</h3>
<p>Defendant Claims to be Working in Fujian; Police Claim Deliberate Failure to Appear</p>
<p>Mo Jinsong, a 19-year-old Ningbo native and the young owner of the Momo Oil Drum Company at 339 Baike Road, residing at 23 Lane 45, Qingdao Road, was accused of having met a dance girl named Wu Meixiu at the Taohuajiang Dance Hall in the Taichang Building on Zhejiang Road in February. Wu, only 14 years old and a local resident, was allegedly lured by Mo due to her youth and inexperience. On the night of February 27th, she was lured by Mo to Room 7 of the Hongkou Grand Hotel on North Sichuan Road and had illicit relations. Afterwards, Mo, having achieved his purpose, treated Wu with disdain. Wu's mother, Wu Xu, learned of the matter and hired attorney Chen Maoxuan to report it to the police, accusing Mo Jinsong of rape. After investigation, the police confirmed the facts and requested the First Special Court to issue a summons. Because the defendant Mo Jinsong did not appear, the case was adjourned for further hearing. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng convened another hearing in the Eighth Criminal Division. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted the defendant Mo Jinsong under Article 221 of the Criminal Law, charging him with offenses against morality. Mo Jinsong still did not appear. A lawyer was hired to defend him, while the plaintiff, Wu Xu, and Wu Meixiu, appeared with their agent, attorney Chen Maoxuan, and recounted the circumstances of the rape. The defendant's wife, along with their agent attorney, appeared in court and claimed that Mo was currently working for the Zhongxing Egg Company in Xinghua, Fujian, and could not attend. Police lawyer Li stated that the defendant had deliberately failed to appear and requested that an arrest warrant be issued to bring the defendant to court. Judge Huang then ordered the case to be adjourned to the 17th of this month for further hearing, and Mo Jinsong was approved for arrest.</p>

They disguised themselves as customers and went to arrest him, bringing him to the police station and sending him to the First Special District Court. After the interrogation, he awaited sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Dai Rongduo delivered the verdict in the Third Criminal Division, sentencing Jin Qingzhang to five years in prison for the intent to use and the act of delivering counterfeit banknotes to others, as a warning.

<p>Li Changshou, a local resident of middle age, with a reputedly comfortable financial situation, runs the Yunfei Bicycle Shop at 243 Yujia'an Road, Zhabei, which is doing well. A Cantonese man named Zhu Hu harbored resentment because Li had refused to lend him money. Yesterday morning, at around 6:30, Zhu gathered more than 30 followers, including Feng An and Zhu Wang, armed with knives, iron bars, and other weapons, and went to cause trouble. Li, not willing to show weakness, also gathered more than 20 people and fought near the entrance of Lane 1203, Qimei Road. Knives flashed, and blood splattered. Li Changshou was stabbed in the head and chest. Wu Mingcai, Zhang Jichang, and Fu Dexing also suffered serious knife wounds and collapsed in pools of blood.

The Ministry forwarded the case to the Shanghai District Court, where prosecutor Tang Ruxiu investigated. Ye Fukang posted bail of 20,000 yuan in cash and was released. Wang Hanqing later reconciled outside of court and requested his lawyer, Gu Jirong, to submit a petition to the court to close the case. However, the prosecutor, considering the case to be a public prosecution and for the sake of rectifying public morals, exercised his authority and filed a public prosecution against Ye Fukang for embezzlement. Judge Lu Hongyi held eight hearings, and the facts of the case became clear. Yesterday, a verdict was announced, sentencing Ye Fukang to one year in prison as a warning.</p>

<p>The Cantonese woman Liang Chen Peiqiong filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court to end her adoption relationship with her adopted daughter, Xiuzhen, because Xiuzhen ran away with belongings. This was reported in the newspaper on March 19th. It is now known that the woman's husband is not Liang Xingqing, an employee of the Shihe Jewelry Company, and that he is not involved in this matter. The adopted daughter, Xiuzhen, stole clothes and ran away on the 15th day of the twelfth lunar month. She was reported to the police and found. The woman feared that she would go astray and run away again in the future, so she filed a lawsuit with the court to order the termination of the relationship. At the hearing, she was willing to follow the judge's advice and give her 20 yuan in legal tender for her use. The previous report that the lawyer had paid 5 yuan on her behalf was not true.

<h3>Recent News from the China Ancient Coin Society</h3>
<p>The China Ancient Coin Society held its regular meeting the day before yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Ding Fubao, Zhang Jiliang, Chen Ruzhai, Yang Kailing, and others. The subject of study was the Tianshi coin. Zhang Jiliang showed two newly acquired Tianshi Tongbao coins in regular script and Tianshi Yuanbao coins in seal script. The production was exquisite, and they were rare treasures. It was an unexpected coincidence that both were acquired by Mr. Zhang at the same time. It is said that the Tianshi coins were cast when Ming Yuzhen claimed the throne in Chengdu. Because so few were cast, circulation was scarce, so it was not easy to obtain them. It was also heard that the society's annual meeting this year will be held on May 1st. At that time, collectors from all over the country will gather together, and it will surely be a grand occasion. Preparations are actively underway. In addition, the fourth issue of Ancient Coin Studies has been published, containing abundant material. It is the only valuable ancient coin publication in China and is currently sold by Shanghai Magazine Company Authors Bookstore and Medical Bookstore.</p>
<h3>Life Mutual Aid Society Establishes Transportation Driver Affairs Committee</h3>

<h3>Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association Director Takes Office</h3>
<p>Since Changwu Committee Member Fang Jiaobo was publicly nominated by the board of directors and supervisors of the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai to concurrently serve as the director of the association and was granted the authority to perform this public service without pay, he, along with receiving committee members Jin Runxiang and Zhang Zhaoyuan, successfully completed the takeover yesterday and attended the inauguration ceremony. He also published a statement to the members, saying, "Jiaobo has followed the elders and fathers of the fellow townsmen in founding this association. For nearly 30 years, he has served in various honorary positions. In this reelection, he was again reelected as a Changwu Committee member and also bears the heavier responsibility of serving concurrently as the director of association affairs. I am deeply afraid that I am not up to the task. Considering the public interest of the fellow townsmen, I dare not be afraid of hard work and refuse the director's salary to save expenses for the association. If it is beneficial to the public, I dare not refrain from exerting my best efforts. Among the fellow townsmen's groups in Shanghai, this association was established the earliest. Ningbo citizens account for the majority of residents in Shanghai. The position of the association is very important. It is hoped that with the spirit of unity, we can seek the welfare of our hometown and work together to achieve progress. Jiaobo's ability is weak, and there may be shortcomings in my work. I hope that my members will provide guidance at any time. If there are any good ideas about what should be promoted or reformed in the association's affairs, please inform me in writing for reference. I will be extremely grateful."</p>

<h3>Premier Schuschnigg Sacrifices Love for Political Power</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>On February 14th of this year, Austrian Prime Minister Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg delivered many remarks to the leaders of the Fatherland Front. This speech, though outwardly appearing passionate and stirring, concealed a deeply personal sacrifice, as Austrian newspapers did not carry a single word about it. Consequently, few Austrians, apart from the aristocracy, were aware of it. Even people around the world would never have imagined that this politician, born into nobility, possessing a simple nature, and with the demeanor of a scholar, would willingly sacrifice his personal happiness for his political principles. What exactly happened? Since his wife died in a car accident in 1935, Dr. Schuschnigg had not remarried. He felt very lonely returning home after work each day, and given his position of great responsibility, the lack of a beloved wife to comfort him was detrimental to his health. He therefore began to carefully search for a suitable partner, and after much deliberation, he settled on a target who was already married and had four children. She was the daughter of a world-renowned minister of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Her husband was a Hungarian Count. Now aged thirty-four, although past her prime, her beauty was admired by everyone in the Hungarian aristocracy. Therefore, Schuschnigg's love for her was intense, and she was also willing to marry this world-famous dictator. With these two lovers soon to be happily united, Austria was about to experience a Mrs. Simpson-like affair. This news filled the Austrian National Socialist Party (Nazis) with joy, because when the previous Prime Minister, nicknamed "Little Napoleon" Dollfuss, was in power, their uprising failed, and Dollfuss died for his country in the turmoil. Dr. Schuschnigg was Dollfuss's confidant, and he inherited Dollfuss's position during the national crisis. Having learned from the past, he naturally continued to use strong-arm tactics to deal with the Nazis. Despite expending great effort, the Nazis were unable to overthrow Schuschnigg, and so now they encountered an opportunity to make this iron-willed Prime Minister, like former British King Edward, willingly abdicate for the sake of his beloved. Austria is a Catholic country, and Schuschnigg is a Catholic, according to the religion's laws, he cannot marry a divorced woman. As Prime Minister, violating religious laws would be unacceptable to the nation, so he could only retreat at the right time to avoid being ousted. Although rumors spread that the Countess had petitioned the Pope to annul her marriage, the Pope's power could not overcome public opinion. Therefore, everyone in the Nazi Party was elated and informed the associates of the late Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, who were preparing to succeed Schuschnigg. Gömbös, during his lifetime, was a patron of the Nazi Parties in both Austria and Hungary, and the Nazi Parties of Austria and Hungary had already become integrated. The Nazi Party felt that the issue had now reached a critical point and could be resolved with a single letter. In their minds, there were only two people who could succeed Schuschnigg: one was the pro-Church Mayor of Vienna, Schmitz, who was the enemy of the Nazi Party; the other was the pro-German Austrian Foreign Minister Dr. Guido Schmidt, who was a friend of the Nazi Party. They were only waiting for Schuschnigg to announce his wedding date, so they could force him to resign. Austrian Catholics were greatly alarmed by this news, and Bishop Linzer reportedly gave Schuschnigg a stern warning. Later, Schuschnigg painfully decided not to follow in the footsteps of King Edward VIII. He told his most trusted colleagues that he would rather sacrifice his personal happiness to preserve Austria's political system. Since falling in love with the Countess, Schuschnigg's mind had been preoccupied with personal matters. In January, he delivered a speech expressing a lukewarm attitude towards politics. The Nazi Party took the opportunity to organize a small political group, disguising it as a cultural organization, but secretly preparing to gather the comrades scattered after the failed uprising in 1934, intending to regroup and achieve their political goals. Schuschnigg was also aware of their conspiracy, but initially, he was distracted by love and ignored it. However, in his recent speech to the leaders of the Fatherland Front, he exposed the Nazis' hidden agenda and sternly rebuked them. As a result, the Nazi Party's hopes turned to ashes, while the Hungarian legitimist aristocrats' hopes for the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty were rekindled. The reason Schuschnigg sacrificed his love was to be able to place his chosen one on the Austrian throne in the future. In fact, Schuschnigg himself also harbored ambitions for that high position. Coincidentally, Austria is now home to two great figures struggling in the field of love: one is the Duke of Windsor, who gave up his kingdom for love, and the other is Prime Minister Schuschnigg, who painfully sacrificed love for political power. The one who is saddened is the Countess, but after hearing this, Mrs. Simpson will be even more grateful for her lover's passion.</p>
<h3>Island City Notes</h3>
<p>— Takuo</p>
<p>The deep black waves crashed against the rocks on the shore. The sound of the crashing waves echoed around this desolate island year after year. Although there were traces of fishermen here, they were so timid that they only appeared when the sun shone on the sea and the waves were a little calmer. Then, they could be seen on the small corner of the shore, casting their tattered fishing nets and singing soft mountain songs. On this barren, wild island, everything grew freely and chaotically. Weeds and pine forests covered the appearance of the mountains. Wild cats and mountain dogs occupied this world. Whenever the golden light of the sun shone on the green mountains and fields, giant peng birds would spread their wings and fly in the sunlight. Everything grew and died in a world of light and freedom. Although the shadows of the night would swallow everything here, revealing the terror of darkness, the scattered fishing lights on the shore, the bonfires lit by fishermen among the pine forests and weeds, and the hungry roars of mountain dogs and wild cats pierced the terrifying curtain of the night everywhere. In short, everything here was free and vibrant. But all of this was destroyed by the flames of civilization and became a relic of more than a hundred years ago. What we see here today is not the desolate, free, wild island, but a modern civilized world, a huge island city of the East.</p>
<p>Although the dark black waves still crash against the shore, they cannot shake the steel-boned docks. Although the weeds and pine forests still densely cover the appearance of the mountains, they have been pruned and are arranged.</p>

<h3>Great Battle of the Spanish Army, Navy, and Air Force</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>According to yesterday's newspaper, the government forces and nationalist forces in northern Spain are fighting fiercely for the city of Bilbao. The great battle of the army, navy, and air force is still raging. The German army is fighting in the west, and the international situation is very tense. I have said that the world is filled with the smell of gunpowder, and the outbreak of a major war is possible at any time and any place. Because a country that is called rich and powerful, without adequate preparation and without the certainty of victory, has not yet dared to openly start a war and expand the battlefield. The time for a major war has not yet matured, so it can still remain temporarily stable.</p>
<p>However, this state of temporary stability, judging from the current situation, is also unsustainable. In name, the war in Spain is a war between the government forces and the nationalist forces, but in fact, it is a war between the fascist and non-fascist factions. This is an open secret, and no one can deny it. Regardless of which side wins, Spain will be the victim of both sides, which is truly tragic. Germany and Italy have been extremely helpful in assisting the nationalist forces and expected to have certain control over the victory. Unexpectedly, after a stalemate of several months, there has been no result, and they have become embarrassed and angry. They are actively increasing their troops, with a determination to burn their boats. On the British and French side, a Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War was formed to closely monitor the German and Italian armies. In such a situation, I fear that it will inevitably develop into a major war.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since Germany announced its rearmament and Italy dispatched troops to Abyssinia, Britain and France initially intended to intervene militarily in these two campaigns. As a result, they were intimidated by the violence of the two countries, and a great fury was averted. However, the softening of the diplomatic attitude of Britain and France was undeniable. Therefore, British Members of Parliament raised stern questions, believing that the authorities' attitude towards foreign countries was abnormally cowardly and extremely dissatisfied. Although these MPs may not know or understand the difficulties of the country, the authorities have their own unavoidable difficulties. But the more Britain retreats, the more the other party advances; the weaker Britain is, the stronger the other party becomes. This is the inevitable situation. Therefore, unless Britain and France have the greatest determination today, there will be unpredictable dangers in the future.</p>
<p>Britain and France believe that by appeasing on one hand and expanding the military on the other, they may temporarily submit for a while, hoping to clear their name in the future. They should know that while you expand your military, they also expand their military; while you prepare, they also prepare. So when can you have certain control over the victory, and when can you have the certainty of victory? I fear that it will be a distant prospect. The most dangerous thing is Britain. Britain itself only has the British Isles, but its colonies are all over the world. Therefore, Britain's lifeline is the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal. Now that Italy has Abyssinia, the Mediterranean Sea has an important relationship with Italy. The hegemony of the Mediterranean Sea may fall into the hands of Italy. The crisis for Britain lies here. Yesterday, the Italian Giornale d'Italia published an article that was very blunt, saying, "Britain's hegemony in the Mediterranean Sea has now become a historical relic and has come to an end forever. On the shores of the Mediterranean, there is now a young and strong country, rising up and determined to take Britain's place." I wonder what Britain will think of this.</p>

<p>They are neatly arranged, and they can no longer cover the white mansions that dot the mountains and fields. Winding through the mountains and fields are asphalt roads that resemble giant black snakes, not the small earthen paths flattened by the footsteps of fishermen gathering firewood. The shore where fishermen cast their nets has become a wharf with bustling traffic. Huge buildings have replaced the low thatched huts. When the sun shines on the sea and the mountains and fields, there is no soaring of giant peng birds or the songs of fishermen. All there is is the black shadow of airplanes and the deafening sound of steam whistles. The fishing lights on the shore at night and the bonfires among the pine forests have been replaced by bright torches. There is no terror of the night, no curtain of darkness. Everything is civilization, a world of joy and excitement.</p>
<p>However, when you see the steel cannons with giant muzzles preserved in the park, and the black giant shells used as fence posts, you will know and understand that they are the tools that transformed the wilderness into civilization. Because of them, the wild island of more than a hundred years ago was transformed into today's civilized world.</p>
<p>The masters of the free and bright wilderness world—the fishermen—no longer have a place to set foot here. Although there are still many people of the small, yellow-faced race here, they are no longer the masters of this place. This is no longer their world, because everything that belonged to them has been destroyed by the steel cannons with giant muzzles and the black giant shells. Today's masters say, "We are civilization, we have transformed the wild and barbaric world, and we are the masters of today's civilization!" Then, they smile happily. But they do not admit that the tools that destroy everything from the wilderness to civilization are also barbaric, and that civilization is created from barbaric tools.</p>
<p>Those weak former masters, who are ruled by today's masters of civilization, perhaps they will forget everything from the past under the enjoyment of civilization, forgetting the free and bright island that belonged to them! But when they see the huge steel cannons and the black giant shells, the past shame, the wounds pierced by the tools of civilization, all the past tragedies will flash in their hearts.</p>
<p>The wilderness has been transformed into civilization, but will the masters of the wilderness era forever live under the rule of the new masters of civilization? Will they forever forget everything when they were destroyed and be happy under civilization?</p>
<p>We must not forget that in the process from wilderness to civilization, there was a barbaric era of flesh and blood stained with cannonballs!</p>
