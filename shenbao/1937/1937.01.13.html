<p>時評</p>
<h3>德法與摩洛哥問題</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>西班牙的內戰雖已發生半年之久。而政府軍與叛軍的勝負。至今還未判明。最近各國大批志願兵的湧入西境。更使伊比里亞半島的戰爭日趨國際化。但各國志願兵的參戰與軍火的輸入。還祇反映出歐洲各强國間的間接鬥爭。而最近德國在摩洛哥的積極活動。（如大批軍隊登陸及建立軍事要塞）才形成了法德二國的直接衝突。使圍繞於西班牙內戰而起的歐洲問題更形嚴重。現在法國已令摩洛哥駐軍擴充至戰時實力。國防部長達拉第已定於數日內前往摩洛哥視察防地。法國國務部次長德桑更於十日發表演說。嚴重警告德國。謂“外人務須明瞭。法國决不能為威武所屈服。故如炫耀兵力。違背條約。或間接侵犯法國之權利。卽將斷絕和平解决之機會。”並明顯指出德國在北非設置勢力範圍是法國所不能容許的。</p>
<p>法國為什麼這樣注重德國在摩洛哥的活動呢。這是有歷史的原因的當十九世紀末葉。歐洲各國在非洲殖民地的爭奪戰是非常激烈的。但自一九○四年的英法協商成立與一九○六年阿爾奇西拉斯（Algeciras)會議後形勢始稍緩和。而法國在摩洛哥的宗主權也自此確立。但德國對於法國在北非勢力的發展却異常反對。因此在一九○五年一九○六年以及一九○九年。德國都有敵對的舉動。到了一九一一年。更發生嚴重的阿加提（Agadir）事件。幾使大戰發生。後賴法國的讓步。事件總算平靜過去。迨歐戰爆發。德國戰敗。這問題自然暫時解决。但自近年德國復興。希特勒上台後。對菸殖民地的爭奪又恢復到過去的情形。而西班牙的內戰正是德國在北非攫取勢力的極佳機會。於是法德過去在摩洛哥的衝突就又死灰重燃了。</p>
<p>上面是就法德在摩洛哥鬥爭的過去歷史說的。但是現在德國活動的地方。是在西屬的摩洛哥。而法國為什麼要反對呢。這也是有歷史原因的。原來北非摩洛哥一帶本是法國與西班牙爭奪的塲所。後以一九○四年的法西絛約與一九一二年的法西條約及法國與摩洛哥條約的訂成才好解决了多年的糾纷。一九一二年法摩絛約規定以摩洛哥為法國保護國。但允將其一部土地作為西班牙勢力範圍。同年法西條約規定“西班牙政府担保决不轉讓或放棄摩洛哥境內西班牙勢力範圍之全部或一部。卽令暫時轉讓。亦所不許”根據這些條約的規定。法國當然不容德國勢力的插足西屬摩洛哥。而認最近北非形勢的發展是於法國有重大的關係了。</p>
<p>德國方面現雖否認他們的活動。並謂這是共產黨的造謠。但事實究竟是很明顯的。因為英法當局早在過去一月中交換德國在北非活動的情報了。我們且放開德國的野心不說。單就最近摩洛哥的現狀來論。也是法國所極不放心的。因為叛軍弗朗哥為要獲得摩爾人的踴躍參戰。已允許於事後給他們以極大的自治權。這於法屬摩洛哥土著的影響非常重大。要是以後德國仍繼續採取挑戰的政策。則歐洲的危機是更要銳化了。</p>
<h3>蘇聯新預算軍事費激增</h3>
<p>較去年增三成有半　第三屆中常會開幕</p>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇聯中執會第三屆常會、本日在克姆林宮開始舉行、史丹林•莫洛托夫•加里寗•卡昂諾維夫•伏洛希羅夫•奧爾卓尼基茲•安德萊也夫及其他黨政領袖出席時、全塲報以熱烈喝采、（十一日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］一九三七年蘇俄陸軍預算、較之一九三六年之數字約增百分之三十五、估計一九三七年之支出、為二○•一○二•○○○•○○○盧布、按去歲為一四•八一五•○○○•○○○盧布、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>論及一九三七年國家預算收入部份估計、格氏指出本年收入預計為九七•七八二•四百萬盧布、較去年增一四•三九○百萬盧布、卽百分之一七•三、支出部份為九六•八三二百萬盧布、較去年增百分之一八•五、本年大批資金將用於三項主要業務、卽國民經濟投資•提高勞動者文化物質水手•及鞏固國防力、本年資本建築經費為三二五億盧布、</p>
<p>在常會全體久久熱烈掌聲下、格氏報告本年預算中列入國防委員會項下經費為二○•一○二•二百萬盧布、一九三六年為一四•九○○百萬盧布、格氏指出國防經費之增加、一方面係因去年內紅軍力量之增加、重工業之大量發展及國防工業委員會之組成、使紅軍可添備最良最貴之武裝品、故亦需增加經費、此外、據格氏云、工業農業之成就、更使紅軍一切給養品儲備額均可增加、同時並須增建貨棧兵營及紅軍人員住宅等、</p>
<p>格氏繼報告其他支出項目、指出本年敎育經費為一八五億盧布、去年為一三九億盧布、衛生經費本年為七五億盧布、去年為五八億盧布、</p>
<p>格氏結論云、“本年此幾達千億盧布之預算、及迅速成長的社會主義社會之預算、反映蘇維埃國家之威力與發展、吾人時代中最偉大文件、史丹林主義憲法所規定之蘇聯公民權利、已完全反映於此次數字中”云、（十二日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>王裕凱播音演講公民訓練問題（二）</h3>
<p>次說到日本、日本公民的習性、也有幾個特點、</p>
<p>第一為國犧牲精神——日本人的愛國思想、在東方可算是首屈一指、它的國民敎育宗旨、可以說是完全國家主義的敎育、日本之大學生、負有灌輸國家精神予民衆的責任、故雖幼童與下女、均知道為國犧牲、日俄戰爭、日本之所以能壓倒帝俄、這不能不歸功於日本小學敎師之努力、</p>
<p>第一簡樸耐勞——日本人生活的簡樸、從衣食住三方面都充分表現、他們的住房是用木板和紙殼造成的、普通的人、住了一間房子日裏充會客室、夜裹從壁櫥裹取出被褥鋪在地上、就算臥室、可以說非常簡單、吃的問題、日本人也是非常簡樸、普通人吃的東西、不過是一碗冷飯和幾塊鹽蘿蔔而已、出去工作或學生上學去、也僅就這些東西裝入小木盒裹、叫做“便當”、放在大衣袖子裹就出去、到用膳時倒些開水吃吃、就算完事、假如今天在客來、先行跪下、將小方桌擺在屋子中間、品茶一會、這就是他們欵客之方、穿的衣服亦力去奢華、他們所穿衣服為“和服”、寬衣大袖、質料結實、但價甚低廉、腳上穿的鞋、大多數是不值多錢的木展、很少人穿起皮鞋、但他們做起事來、眞正能吃苦耐勞、毫無倦意、故自明治維新以來、國內無論工藝上、軍事上、政治上、醫學上以乃其他一切應用科學、靡不蒸蒸日上、日趨進步的途程、</p>
<p>第三努力創造——日本是一個新進的國家、他們的文化、十九是從中國去的、無論是道德的標準、抑或是學術上的主張、都是模仿中國、及明治維新以後、則模仿西洋、一切的風俗、文化、學術、都步武歐美、翻譯事業異常發達、留學生回國幾以翻譯工作為一種專門職業、西洋各國新出圖書、不及半年、在日本一定有翻譯本出現、迨至目前、不但各種事業均能步歐美後塵、具有駕之而上的趨勢、遠者暫不去論、我們只要看它駐在我國領土內的軍艦飛機以及各種新式武器、就可證明他們創造能力的偉大了、以上所講美日兩國國民性的大概情形、固有不少之處可供吾人參考、但我國實際情形、未必與他們盡同、茲就鄙見所及、列舉下述數端、略加詮釋、以作我國公民訓練之目標、</p>
<p>㊀普及識字敎育——中國文盲太多、除了趕緊普及識字敎育之外、實在沒有方法立刻使他們有愛國情緒與救國觀念、上海曾經有過推行識字敎育的運動、我以為現在更應該推廣到鄉村、以求識字敎育普及、（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>三品停新交易</p>
<p>本週內祇做了結買賣　近月紗昨已達三百元</p>
<p>十二日大阪電、三品期紗漲六元五角至十元、近月為三百元、遠月為二百八十三元、期棉漲一元二角五分至跌一角、近月為七十六元三角、遠月為八十一元四角五分、</p>
<p>又路透社大阪電、三品交易所於今日午後開經紀人大會、議决本星期內暫停紗花人造絲新交易、星期二將照常開拍、惟祇做了結買賣、</p>
<p>三品暴漲停市紗市反見下游</p>
<p>生產視前大增　同業傾向拋賣　廢歷結賬將屆　交易不免减縮</p>
<p>紗市回疲、氣勢轉趨平靜、實因廢歷年關將屆、商業習慣上賬目方面、有一度總結束、因此現紗客方銷路殊覺呆滯、套賣近期紗廠商尤夥同業中議論、謂目下各廠全部開車、對於工作方面、趕工製造、生產數量較前大增、傾向拋賣、惟大阪三品漲勞劇烈、午後三品電訊云、三品暴漲、午後停市、又一消息、三品紗祇做了結、不能新做、至本星期六止云、</p>
<p>標紗新買殊缺</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月致下跌、良以上午後收盤、市傳三品紗穿出三百元外、最高價收盤、今晨消息利緩、三品暫停新買賣、衹做了結、於是人心更定、三品來電本月僅漲二元、遠漲三•四元、同時本埠現紗交易殊感凋敝、故新買者尤少興趣、迨至收盤、三品本月再跳、已達三百元、遠期亦漲三•四•五元、結果比上日價均漲六元半至十元、標紗收盤略見上升、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌六•七•八角至一元三角、午後開盤市情甚疲、升降範圍殊狹、三品電訊云三品暴漲、午後停市、塲中交易更少、現紗生意澹泊、結果本月比上午收盤價漲五角、遠跌二•五•九角查賣出裕康一千包、仁豐六百五十包、合興一千包、森康一千包、大昌成二千六百包、長豐一千二百五十包、協成二千二百包、信誠千六百包、泰昌八百五十包、買進望泰興一千三百包、通記一千九百包、恒益八百包、裕大一千三百五十包、明德八百包、生源一千三百五十包、永大一千三百五十包、元一一千一百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>紗銷日見清淡</p>
<p>現紗銷路平澹、查全日各帮買出期現紗統計五百六十七包、售價跌一元外、各帮買额列下、</p>
<p>投機不乏做多　棉價終為存貨壓制</p>
<p>棉市轉挫、因英棉趨勢暗淡、廠方需求岑寂、故人心平常、但有一部份投機心思、因印棉粗絨、漲汛較熾、三品花價高昂做多、然上海存棉未减、紗市平庸、</p>
<p>標花回跌四角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因上日隨三品花傳言收高盤、今晨美棉微跌、印棉粗絨漲力較強、細絨平平、大阪三品花本月雖漲二元六角、遠月反見下跌七八角至一元三角半、人心更挫、各月跌二三角、二盤以後、仍屬平庸、逾至收盤、聞三品花近期稍跌、遠期上漲二元外、市勢稍昂、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌角半至一角、午後開盤、市况尚昂、三盤以後轉趨下降、塲內交易甚清、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌一角半、查賣出恒益一千三百擔、賡豐一千一百擔、昶記一千三百擔、大昌成一千二百擔、長豐一千三百擔、潤康爲千四百擔、協成一千二百擔、同和一千八百擔、源興昌一千五百擔、益康一千九百擔、新昶一千九百擔、長和一千四百擔、買進吉豐一千五百擔、裕大三千三百擔、長餘一千三百擔、望泰興一千四百擔、元一一千三百擔、恒昌一千擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現棉消費平凡</p>
<p>棉花廠胃未能暢健、來源到姚花一千一百包、通花一千三百八十六包、</p>
<p>三品狂騰中　日紗海外輸出活躍</p>
<p>邇來大阪三品棉紗、步步飛騰、本日一月期已達三百元、上海棉紗輸出探算更為便宜、故南洋方面之買戶、皆向本埠日商洋行購訂、成立約有一千包、同時日本亦向本埠日商行家頻頻成為四十支紗、有將開始一九三四年以來之對日輸�出之勢、</p>
<p>查大阪三品棉紗行市、近日繼續上騰、前週末因強化匯兌管理法宣佈後、物價更行高漲、三品棉花市塲因交貨之懸念、漲勢變本加厲、遠月七月期漲至八十二元外、據傳印度棉紗有貨亦稀、故南洋方面買意尢急、遂向各方面定貨、昨日成約者為二十支豐年及藍鳳日紗兩牌、共計五百包、價格為二百七十六元、二•三•四月期交貨云</p>
<p>借欵棉花尚無辦法　美棉老多頭從事了結　英棉絲商對日奧商約之憂慮　要求政府用訂約政策圖保障</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况參差呆滯、各月跌七磅音至漲一磅音、正月及三月期、均有多頭了結及移往遠月、同時老多頭見借欵棉花尚無確定辦法、恐受影響、亦從事了結、致市益軟、惟同業在跌價時、努力買進、國內紡織界消費甚暢、惜新戶大缺、收盤以股市有力、市况稍定計現貨跌三磅音、期貨跌三至五磅音本國紗織品、消費仍佳、惟缺乏新興趣、英棉現貨漲二點、期貨漲四點、印棉初因日紗堅昂、大陸及出口商買進而漲、旋以棉農及投機家賣出而回、卒以投機家再進、市價又漲、計平果爾漲三•七五至五羅比、奧姆辣漲、一•五至三羅比、白羅溪漲二羅比、原電錄左、（十一日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十二日開盤預測、白羅溪為二百三十羅比半、奧姆辣為二百○六羅比七五、平果爾為一百八十二羅比半、均不動、</p>
<p>又路透十一日倫敦電、今日孟却斯脫商會舉行董事會議、關於日奧商約對英國棉花及人造絲業之影響、表示憂慮、會後發表正式文告、意謂英政府應與奧國進行更有效合作、俾奧國能維持其與雷開夏州紗布出口業順利條欵、董事會議决呈請首相包爾特溫、請求內閣採用訂約政策與各國商磋商約充分保障、英國棉花及人造絲市之穩固、將為任何國與英訂良好商約之絕對條件、</p>
<p>上週間紗廠購辦原棉統計</p>
<p>上週間本麥華日廠購辦原棉量、日廠買進七千七百四十一包、華英廠辦進一萬四千三百六十七包、合計為二萬二千一百○八包、茲將中外各廠採辦之原料花名及額量、分誌如下、（單位包）</p>

<h3>特載戰時的財政奚東曙（續五日報）</h3>
<p>— 奚東曙</p>
<p>勢不能再行提高稅率，徒將經濟的負擔，加在社會中經濟能力薄弱人們的身上，違反賦稅均平的原則，我們籌措戰費時，就不能倚賴鹽稅為增加收入的來源，至於統稅，係包括棉紗火柴捲菸麥粉水泥等項，這幾種國內的工業，業已負著很重的稅，卽使在戰時，勉強維持現狀，統稅的收入，也不能增加許多，恐怕還是要减少的，不會增加的，所以我們可以預料，一旦風雲告急，這六萬幾千萬元的收入，將要驟然减少，减少的數目，雖然不能預知，以理推測，如要减到十分之五乃意中事，這幾種剩餘的稅收，祗足應付政府經常的支出，若以之應付戰費，恐兩個月亦不能維持，在國家動員需要鉅額戰費的時候，不能不急速的確定出戰期中適當的財源，否則戰費必無着，現在我們可以先作一個這浩大戰費的估計，好知其大概。</p>
<p>戰費的估計，最不容易得到精確的數，所可以知道的，就是未來戰爭中動員人數之多，兵器彈藥消耗之大，以及機械化武器成本之高，皆足使戰費達空前的鉅額，對於軍備，各國皆守秘密的，其費用實不能作準確的估算，我們至少限度，可以用近代化的歐戰，作為目前之適當的參考，歐戰中，德俄英法四國，動員兵力，共有一千二百六十餘萬人，較之戰前，常備軍人數，多出四倍有餘，據申報年鑑統計，我國現役士兵，有二百二十五萬餘人，假使以四倍此數的人來作戰，則為九百萬人，就照我國陸軍薪餉定額，每月十二元八角計算，一月中薪餉，卽費去一萬一千五百二十餘萬元，其餘軍械子彈補充的費用及各種補助及撫卹費尚未在內，其費用之浩大可知，在歐戰中，英法俄意德奧，每日陸軍戰費，以每名兵士計算，約為十七元二角五分，其聞有高價的英國的志願兵，以及生活低廉的俄義兩國的兵士，卽使我們取其三分之一的費用，以九百萬人，每人每日五元七角五分計算，每日亦需五千一百七十五萬元，每日需一萬五千五百萬元，歐戰中，各交戰國，每月戰費平均支出額，以義國為最小，每月約費四萬一千三百萬元，卽使取其半數，也要兩萬萬餘元，我們敢大胆的說，戰事一開始，每月所需平均的戰費，决不在一萬萬元數目以下，這是無疑的，在座諸位，均屬軍事專家，對於戰費一層，諒必胸有成竹，現在儘可以研究這浩大戰費之籌措的方法。</p>
<p>戰時的支出，原為取得大量的人力與物力，而政府在此時要增加收入，就是要增加其人力與物力的購買力，使政府在支配人力物力上，處於優先的地位，以求加强其抵抗力，為唯一的目標，戰時的收入，必須要大量的，是要迅速而不能緩的，所採用的課稅的制度，必須要能使政府在預定的時期中，得有大量的而又靠得住的稅收，此類稅制，亦必須富有彈簧性，隨時可以利用以增加稅收，所要籌集的鉅欵，必須出諸富者的身上，無論用何方式，或直接徵稅，或暫時舉債，非取自富庶階級不可，因為政府所需要的，除人力外，就是物資，物資是在富裕人手中，非貧者所有的，所以我們的收入，必要以財富為對象，徵稅的目標，要使其落在財富上，因為財富與人工，在任何一時期內，當然有一定的額數，如私人盡量的使用，則政府不能支配以應戰事的需要，是為顯見之理。</p>
<p>按政府要由民間取得財物與勞力，不外用三種重要的方式，㊀徵發㊁課稅㊂公債</p>
<p>徵發為對財物與人工强制的使用，此種無代價的徽發，容易使國民的負擔不平均，而引起人民的反感，如戰事一延長，對於國民經濟，將要發生惡劣的影響，反不如普遍地徵稅，而以代價僱用人工及購買財物，所以徵發的制度，早被文明國家所屏棄，在戰爭時期，欲以急速有效的方法，取得大量的收入，祗有兩個正常的途徑，一，加稅，二，舉債，戰時的徵稅，應側重在財富，已如上述，財富稅是在有經濟能力人的頭上，作一次金錢的徵收，從其勤勞，或利潤所得，割取一部份，而納稅者，明知其為一度的犧牲，遂不得不節省消耗，或竟對生產事業，作格外的努力。結果，人民的消費，可以節减，國民的總生產量，因增之加，此正符合戰期中政府所持的目標，且當整個國家的生死關頭，人民的生活，（未完）</p>

<h3>牛年牛話</h3>
<p>— （姚成軒）</p>
<p>莫鄙視了它啦！試想維持我們生活的生命劑，維他命，續命湯的黄金萬粟，是由那有功於人類幾千年的動物，便是今年牛年的牛拖着笨重的鐵的鋒犂下耕出來的。勞工是神聖的，而動物中的牛，更值得讚揚萬分。今年是牛年，願大家在新年裏想想賜與我們恩物，而不予報酬，反而傷身不得善終的牛，同時再想想只會消費，不會生産的萬物之靈的人類相較之下，能無慚汗？朱柏廬治家格言説的：「一粥一飯，當思來處不易」，真是值得三思！</p>
<p>我們要有牛一般的任重致遠的精神，要驅除障碍一切的牛鬼蛇神的怪物，這也許是在今年裏值得提起的話吧。</p>
<p>我們知道埃及人是拜動物教的，相傳他們認爲賜與大恩的尼羅河之神的魂靈，是寄托在神牛身上，所以他們非常的重視，和虔誠的崇拜。我現在引這個古典的意義，並不是爲了别的，只是要希望保護有功於人類的動物，不任意屠殺，不使它們作無謂的犧牲。</p>
<h3>和尚兵</h3>
<p>— 孫競文</p>
<p>我曾經聽見有一位老太太説過：「常州是佛地，香火是挺重的」。我們大家都知道常州的大寺院，像天寗寺淸凉寺，的確是很有名氣</p>
<p>我們的國家受着敵人重重的壓廹，已經到了非常時期，公民都要受訓練了；和尚雖然他們似乎是四大皆空的方外人，可是他們終究還在人世間，因此和尚也要受訓練的。近來常州就新添了一種和尚兵。</p>
<p>每天的淸曉，公共體育塲上集合着許多少壯的和尚，操着整齊的歩伐，掮着槍，雄糾糾的武士氣概。跑歩的時候，喊着：「一，一，一二三四。」那是比他們平時唸「阿彌陀佛」有精神得多呢！他們的服裝是和普通壯丁不同的，童子軍樣船形的帽子，有些像西裝式的灰色上衣。</p>
<p>記得我第一次在大街上看見和尚兵，我看着這許多年青的漂亮的小伙子，穿着特殊的軍裝；如果不聽見旁人在談着和尚兵，我的意識上是絶不會猜那是和尚的，雖然他們的特殊軍裝，已經有幾分像和尚衣了。</p>
<p>大慈大悲的戒殺生而終身不吃葷的和尚，如今也要學着殺人的勾當；不知道他們是否能够明瞭，爲民族爭生存的戰爭和殺敵，乃是真真的普渡衆生啊！</p>
<h3>摸蚌人</h3>
<p>— 范顯微</p>
<p>這裏我所寫的摸蚌，讀者别誤會，並不是指一般老嫖客對娼妓所施的齷齪動作—把脈，却是「三本鐵公鷄」，真刀真槍的摸河蚌，這須得先聲明一。</p>
<p>他們爲着生活的鞭策，不惜拿性命來換飯喫，在冰膏雪凍的天氣裏，划了一葉扁舟，沿着曲折的堤岸，袒起一隻右臂，赤裸裸，浸入冰冷的水裏，—掏，—摸，—雖然船舷口的冰淋，一枝枝像水晶箸地下懸着，温暖粗黑的玉臂，凍得發紫，但他們一些也不在意，好像那手浸在熱面湯裏一樣，只管一隻隻地摸起來；有時河水冰成一片，他們竟會用鐵錘打冰，敲一段，摸一段，敲着！摸着！鷄皮膚佈滿了全身體，上下牙關打戰個不停，這普通人恐怕誰也受不了吧！</p>
<p>據一班老於摸蚌的人説：在開首摸的時候，的確臂膀像要斷下來，不過，摸了一陣，倒也不覺得如何！人家戴了手套，反會生起凍瘡來，而我們却不會得，只有幾條坼痕吧了，真是天曉得！</p>
<p>説起河蚌，當然要想起冰豆腐和黄葱啦！這三樣東西，好似鞋拔板刷，—一副河豚，同爲一班老饕家所賞識，食時倘再加以胡椒末少許，真打耳光也不放呢！並且價錢很賤，頗合平民化，三升胡桃四升壳，砌得一大堆蚌壳，却也只能弄到千把錢，生活真再苦也没有咧！</p>
<h3>衣橱脱險記（下）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>法國母女的俠行</p>
<p>那德兵回答道：「太太，你可放心。」説着，三個人已把這口衣橱搬放在門外車上。鄉間的道路，崎嶇不平，所以車行異常顛頓，福勒氏團伏在衣橱裏，也顧不得觸撞的痛苦。這一次在德兵手中經過，居然未被發覺，可算是天不該絶命啦。</p>
<p>福勒氏久伏在衣橱中，健康大受影響，起初小病，勉强還能捱過，後來病况，非吃藥不可。於是戈夫人便先和本村的一位化學家接近，决定其人信實可靠，然後再邀至家中，替福勒氏醫病。戈夫人救護福勒氏，可稱無微不至，而倍爾特里村中知道戈夫人家裏藏着英兵的人，也都守口如瓶，這也可算得奇事中的奇事啊。</p>
<p>有一天，聽説有英俘一批解到村中，福勒氏便和巴斯康氏悄悄地出外，如有人盤問，凖備假稱是比利時的鄉農。福勒氏和英俘中一個同鄉交談後，知道戰事不日便有終止的希望。到了一九一八年十月中的某天，全村忽然大起騷動，駐守村中的德兵，來來往往，忙的不可開交，對於村民的行動，都無心顧及。有一個德兵對戈夫人説道：「我們要去了，英兵就要開到了」。於是三年九個月的光陰大半在衣橱中消磨的福勒氏，才敢外出，他的頭髮，散在滿頭，已變成灰白色，他雖時常爲病魔所困，但因爲日夜盼望的脱險時機，今忽到臨，在狂喜之中，精神又大振了。</p>
<p>最先開到村中的英軍，是加拿大騎兵隊，接着便是第六十六師中的南菲洲蘇格蘭隊。福勒氏因一時惑亂，投入蘇格蘭隊，一位小隊長望見一個形狀可怪的人向營房奔來，便舉起來福槍，對他瞞凖。這也難怪，因爲這樣一個怪人，很容易被人疑爲間諜，或是逃兵，所以便把福勒氏擒住，派了衛兵預備押送到團司令部發落。當時戈夫人母女都怒氣冲冲地和那隊長爭辯，但兩人雖口若懸河，隊中却無一人能解法語，毫不注意她們所説的話。剛要解走的當兒，福勒氏忽脱離衛兵，奔至對街，向一位軍官懇求。那人是德拉克少校，當一九一四年勒加陀大戰時，曾充中尉，統帶第十一胡薩斯騎兵聯隊，這時正在佈置設立傳號處。相隔數年，他還認識福勒氏。於是便命停止押解，並寫了一個字條，證明福勒氏的履歷。福勒氏因此得以復回本聯，長官准他請假一月，回國休養。當他啟程渡海之前，曾回到倍爾特里村，向戈夫人母女和巴斯康氏珍重道别，那再造之恩，真非言語所能表示感謝。</p>
<p>筆者在一九二七年二月充每日電聞報特訪員時，首先聽得戈夫人親自談起福勒氏騎兵的舊事，我第一次訪問倍爾特里村戈夫人住所所見的一切，永遠留在腦海，不能遺忘。福勒氏藏身將近四年的那口衣橱，仍舊放在壁角。戈夫人兩手顫顫地捧出第十一胡薩斯騎兵聯隊軍官所贈表示援救同聯兵士感忱的銀杯，又取出英政府所贈的證書和奬章，遞給筆者觀看。她臉上露出很得意的神情。所令人感觸的，這時戈夫人家况蕭條，漸受窮神的威脅。每日電聞報讀者聽得這個消息，便捐了一筆欵氶，作爲戈夫人和她女兒安琪爾的終身年養金。其他法國婦女曾庇護過英兵的，也因此得到沾潤。一九二七年四月，戈夫人母女等經衆迎到倫敦，在市政府接受年養金的證書，隔了幾天，又由英皇喬治和皇后曼麗在温莎宫召見。她們都覺得非常榮耀，她們的俠義，真值得世人欽佩的了。</p>
<h3>説「坊子」</h3>
<p>— 玉父</p>
<p>「坊子」，是一個地名。是在魯東灘縣境內的一個小鎭，也是膠濟路中途的重衝；因爲交通便利，鑛産豐富，所以商業很發達，可是所痛心者，這裏的日人甚多，且「白麪」頗爲流行，因此在街上祗多見面黄肌瘦的中其毒者！在各個弄堂的垃圾箱旁，常常能見到僅披一蔴袋作飄泊的伴侣；看見那張飢餓的臉相，委實怪可憐的！繼之一想起他的由來，又不禁會使我不寒而慄了！</p>
<p>坊子的歷史，雖是在歐戰前爲德人所闢，開鑿炭礦的，可是某國人的勢力確實很雄厚：上有領事館的保護，下有商會金融組合，他們的營業，多以販賣毒品，當舖，出賣估衣，膠鞋，大米爲主，其中以膠鞋的銷路，會使我們有按不住的驚愕！</p>
<p>坊子的東西，有五條馬路，像五條深入農村（吮吸的巨蛇；那裏没有巍峨的高樓大厦，但多很闊氣的西式平房，這裏也没有燈紅酒綠的舞廳，也不多見來往如飛的汽車，不過在街頭中老有載着花枝招展的姑娘，且這姑娘都是出賣肉體的神女，而代價是極低廉的差不多只須一兩元錢，就可達到目的。然而幽會的所在却都附設在某國人勢力下的賣毒塲所。</p>
<p>商業中心區在三馬路，從一馬路到四馬路，統統是明妓暗娼和賭塲及販賣「白麪」的所在。如果有一個附有「土氣」的生客降臨，伊們也會伸出一隻不客氣的紅字來拉你進去的。</p>
<p>坊子的東部有小學校三處，其中以某國的小學爲最完善，其餘二校均係我人所創，然因經費關係，多不合乎兒童心理，也是很可惜的一件事。</p>
<p>最後我再説「太陽鞋」在仿子，爲了看報問題，幾乎每天必到坊子一趟，常見附近村民，出没有某國鞋商者，絡繹不絶，而中國鞋舖，很少有人光顧！這一定是「某國貨便宜」無疑。不然，中國人爲什麽要爭看買呢！這樣一來，弄得中國商店，日見衰落，甚至於不能維持，而某國人却格外活躍，什麽大减價……種種花樣，更足以迷惑顧客，置中國商人於死地！但坊子多鑛工，因此太陽膠鞋，遂交了一歩登天的紅運；據説某家在一月內可銷至五千雙之多，像這樣的銷數，豈不使我們驚訝呀！</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回（素帕寄纒綿奇文鑄錯黄花對憔悴秋信添愁）</p>
<p>可是一等兩天，並没有消息。到了第一日上午，又是學校裏來了通知，開學務會議，商量下學期學務改進的事情。國器是學校裏一個重要教員，不得不去。天下事是那樣巧，他出去了，友梅就來了。今天友梅進來，不像往日那樣豪爽，悄悄的進門，在天井裏站了一站。看到了劉媽就低聲笑問道：老太太今天没有出去吧？説着這話，他那蘋果一般的圓臉，已烘出了兩個很大的圓暈。劉媽道：我們老太太難得出去，在家呢。友梅這才緩緩的走到章老大房門口先伸頭向裏面看了一看。章老太坐在竹椅上，將一疊白手絹，緩緩放在大腿上折疊。笑道：李小姐來了，我正念你呢。友梅心裏一動，這位老太太爲什麽念着我。便笑道：我常來，不打攪你老人家嗎？章老太笑道：你來了，説説笑笑，正好陪着我，怎麽説是打攪？請坐坐。他説着，起身讓坐，把手絹送到衣橱裏去。友梅道：你老人家是淸潔，手絹也預備下了許多。章老太笑道：這不是我的，這是我給國器預備下的。大熱的天，擦汗的手，總應該多預備兩條。他是個書呆子，除了書本子上的事，别的他全顧慮不到，我只好替他預備下了。友梅笑道：伯母這話，正是説顛倒了。你以爲表哥是個書呆子嗎？他無論作什麽都細心極了。只有他書架上的書，擺得齊齊整整的，不歪斜一分。桌子上擺的筆墨小玩意，没有一樣不精緻。我這人的脾氣。就是喜歡整齊，他那分細心，我真願意同他學學。章老太笑道：依然這樣説，可是他的本領，還是在書本上。我在家裏也閑着無事，不妨給他料理料理一些。説到這裏，劉媽捧了一碗茶，雙抓遞給友梅，笑道：我總是這樣説，我們先生，快一點娶一位能幹的少奶奶，就好了。一來，老太太有了伴。二來，這些事就不必老太太過問了。友梅接着茶杯，只把眼光望到茶杯裏去，似乎在想着什麽事，就没有理會到劉媽的話。章老太見他這樣子，便和劉媽丢了一個眼色，意思是叫他不要多説，自然，劉媽含着微笑就走了。（一二二）</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>日本學校裏的級會</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日本學校裏開級會的時候，大都要大嚼一次，决不和我國的學生會，只有報告討論的單調。他們最簡單的在教室裏，把課桌圍成了圓形，吃些茶點水果。普通每人都要出一兩塊錢，到食堂酒館裏去叙餐。菜館的外面，掛着某學校級會的牌子，和宴客一樣。</p>
<p>幾個年輕的下女，在每人面前，放着幾碟簡單精緻的日本菜，接着便是許多日本酒。級會的委員，起立報告了開會的原因以及籌備經過。一陣拍掌聲之後，便開始狼吞虎嚥的大嚼。同學們互相用銅元大的酒杯乾杯敬酒，不是慶祝考試及格，便是希望身體康健。兩三瓶很小的日本酒，那够㡬次乾杯便空空如也，於是到不吃酒的同學面前去討酒吃。不到半小時，酒菜俱盡。於是開始唱歌，用箸擊着碟子和着輪流狂歌。我國人在酒席上淸唱，都要客氣幾聲，做出半推半就的樣子。他們却爭先恐後的自薦着，雖然雌貓呌的聲音，以及頭頸裏的青筋，漲得可怕，還是不肯停止。從民間流行的情歌起到壯嚴静穆的校歌爲止，真是蔚爲大觀。日本學生不論是誰對烟酒歌舞，都可以來幾下，興緻真好。</p>
<p>幾杯日本酒已經把他們的臉兒燒得發紅，把毛巾紥在頭上，幾個人聚在一堆，亂跳亂踊，表演着倭舞。桌子酒杯翻了，學生和下女扭作一團。只有笑聲和呼喚聲，充滿了室內。照相館裏來攝級會的記念照片，各人只得暫時停止了歡樂，安安静静的坐着。幾個下女也挨着要一同攝影，於是你擁我抱，爭着和下女胡纒，攝影師只好耐着性子等待着，直到爭奪妥恊爲止。</p>
<p>攝影完畢之後，又繼續胡鬧着，桌上杯盤狼藉，已没有佐飯的菜肴，自己又不肯挖腰包，在白飯上，澆些冷湯，也就完事了。要吃酒的打翻了瓶子也涓滴全無了。就是有了一杯，也是淘氣的用茶和醬油拼成的。下女都皺着眉，在整理着衣服和髮髻，很顯露着煩惱的樣子，和方才笑盈盈的歡迎入席的樣子大不相同了。學生們的舉動，都已學會了紳士派頭，對下女酒婦們，確是使人難堪的。</p>
<p>在高呼了某某學校萬歳之後，大家預備作鳥獸散了。下女們如釋重負，吐了口氣，俯了頭謝着。一個學生仲手把桌上的花，帶了走。於是小花瓶，香烟盒，玻璃杯，酒杯，都不翼而飛。一個學生拿了一隻小酒杯，向旁邊的學生，做個鬼臉，便向書包裏一丢。</p>
<p>三三兩兩的學生鈎着背，在熱閙的街上蹣跚而行，明天報上登着某校學生酒醉和警察打架，受刑事處分。歌舞昇平，狂歡高歌的日本學生，和站在狂風大雪裏募捐援綏的我國學生，互相對照，不禁暗暗説：「不愧爲國難時的學生」。</p>

<h3>貢獻話二十六年之國貨前途</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>二十五年之國貨界，承法幣實施之後，值各地豐收之年，物價指數與生活指數民同時增高，工業之生産指數，亦見增進，國貨界已感剝極而復否極泰來之象，舉欣欣然有喜色，認爲國貨前途，此後當有無窮之希望。同時政府之積極提倡，社會之熱誠服用，均予國貨進展上以無上之興奮。兹者一元復始，歳序更新，已轉入二十六年矣，爲聞二十六年之國貨前途何若？請述其大概，並附以希望焉。</p>
<p>二十六年之國貨界，首先示全國以進繩者，厥爲公務機關之一致採用國貨，與全國公務員之一致服用國貨。故上海國貨界擬以今年爲公務員國貨年，實有見於公務員爲國民之表率，平日食國家之祿，服國家之事，其愛國與愛用國貨之忱，更爲熱烈，故寄以無限之希望。且實業部已定公務機關服用國貨辦法，則執行其事者，更當嚴密認真，絲毫不可疏忽，萬一汨没良知，以劣貨混充國貨，一經發覺，人格何存。辦法規定以不經濟支出論，一概不准報銷，賠累之責，自取其咎，此應注意者一。</p>
<p>二十六年全國國民經濟建設運動總會，開始籌辦國貨聯合營業公司，爲實行全國國貨網之計畫。此後全國各都市各縣邑各鄉鎭均有買賣國貨之機構。以都市之機製品內銷，以農村之原料品手工品外運，脈絡貫通，國産流行，以官民合作之精神，奏舉國從風之成效，此尤值得快慰者二。</p>
<p>二十六年中國貨界最需要者，爲全國國貨運動之大聯絡，婦女服用國貨會既負聯絡全國婦女之責任，而各地之提倡國貨會服用國貨會，應在同一之目標下，進行同一之歩驟，實心實力，爲國貨謀出路，即所以减少入超，挽回漏扈。希望此一年中，彼此多聯絡，多通聲氣，以收提倡之實效，此應切實進行者三。</p>
<p>敢於一年開始之辰謹以無限之期望，爲國人作蒭蕘之獻也。</p>
<h3>新年與國貨</h3>
<p>— 粱</p>
<p>韶光易逝，民國二十五年的「市民國貸年」，現在已經跟着流水般的光陰而飛去了。新的時序—民國二十六年，已經開始展臨在我們的面前，當這二十六年的新年，還没有整個的消逝的時候，作者趁此時機，貢獻一些提倡國貨方面的意見，以與一般愛國同志相商榷。</p>
<p>古人説：「一日之計在於晨，一年之計在於春。」當此新年，也正是我們確定一年之計的時候。舉凡學術的進修，品性的修養，身體的鍜鍊等等，都需要在一年剛才開始的現在，確定一個進行的方針，而後依次實行，才能收到相當的效果。</p>
<p>就拿今年的提倡國貨運動來説吧！際此新年，我們也得確定一個推行的計劃，譬如在個人方面，在此一年之中，我將如何的來盡力的服用國貨，宣傳國貨，勸導親戚朋友來信仰國貨，購用國貨，凡此種種，都是我們在這新年的時候，應該立下一個計劃，用始終如一的精神，來努力做去的。</p>
<p>其也如各國貨團體，國貨工廠，國貨商號，以及於各學校，各家庭，也都應該在這新年的時候，來確定一個提倡國貨的計劃的。我很希望在計劃方面，不必定得怎樣詳密，但求能切實推行。政治家説：「爲政不在多言，貴在實行耳」。我們的提倡國貨運動，埠之實無高論，也只要大家能切實推行，便自然而然的會得到偉大的效果。</p>
<p>民國二十六年的時序，已經開始轉動了。作者敬以十二分的至誠，把上面的區區小意見，貢獻於諸位讀者之前，希望大家從新年起，一致爲國貨運動多做些切實有效的工作。</p>
<h3>長江各埠的國貨運動（上）</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>上海兩江女子體育師範校長陸禮華氏，她除畢生精力盡瘁女子體育事業而外，對國貨運動，也抱負着最熱烈利真誠；她上次奔走長江各埠，主委鵠的，自然是考察各地門牆桃李的服務狀况，副要使命，却受予上海市國貨運動聯合會的　記，去實地掀起各該省注意國貨的怒潮！歷時四週，蟾圓一易，經皖·贛·鄂·湘四省，雖然走馬看花，已具相當的收穫；陸氏征塵甫缷，公私紛紜，筆者承她見允，僅作了三十分鐘的談話，內容是限於國貨方面的，特爲介紹如后。</p>
<p>蕪湖　第一個碼頭蕪湖，她以爲蕪湖具着水陸交通的優勢，有長江輪船，江南鐵路，牠是皖南重要的商埠，允爲安徽土産輸出外省的樞紐；蕪湖對提倡國貨，可謂僅萌其芽，一片國貨市塲，規模不甚大，没有依據公司組織法成立，還是舊式的沫股制度；喚醒國人服用國貨的，有條專闢的國貨路，約長五十公尺，各地倒可以仿效建築，不無對一般人有個啟示！其他也有册國貨刋物，陸氏抵蕪湖後，曾由專員公署專員高文伯氏，召集過一度會議，成立了蕪湖各界提倡國貨聯合會籌備會，經過這次的聲氣相通，上海蕪湖間有了連繫，逆料以後的進行，只要上海有所推動，他們便會興起響應了；安慶，商業概况，遜於蕪湖，對國貨運動，事先未有組織，陸氏到省後，曾由安徽省黨部，召集各公團，成立安徽各界提倡國貨聯合會籌備會，那邊未辦大規模的國貨市塲，或許有類似的小組織；陸氏僅滯留　宵，她希望省當軸把國貨運動，推及到各縣，紅白大事，注意服用國貨，因爲城池鄉村，只有婚·喪·喜·慶·購買力最强。</p>
<p>九江　九江是個普通市，那邊有九江市國貨運動促進會，設在九江市商會，牠的任務，提倡服用國貨，恊助國貨廠商改進生産，恊助國貨廠商推銷國貨，徵集國貨陳列展覽，參與各地國貨賽會，維護國貨廠商法益，其他如國貨宣傳，國貨調查，國貨證明等；該會有個人會員，工廠商店會員兩種，會務現由林秉周氏主持，林氏是海軍陸戰隊第一獨立旅旅長，他個人非常努力，地方尚少團結，林氏凖備與上海國貨工商團體，取得聯絡，俾國貨前途，日漸張大</p>

<h3>國貨更新年</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>古人云：「欲窮千里目，更上一層樓」我説國貨的進展！亦復如此。十幾年來的提倡國貨運動，無日不在研究與進化中，從命名國貨年起而婦女國貨年，學生國貨年，市民國貨年，國貨的基礎鞏固。國貨的陣綫雄厚，與日俱進，而過客光陰，一刹那又是「公務員國貨年」的開始了。預料農村復興，市面繁榮後，必更有光明，熣燦，如火如茶的國貨企業新紀錄，「欲窮千里目，惟有國貨樂！」筆者敬祝今年是「國貨更新年」。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>報紙價格暴漲</h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>為了工業的不發達，中國的物價，一向是被操縱在外人的手中的，逢到某一國可以獨霸的時候，是獨霸，逢到有別一國侵入的時候，於是競爭便起來了，競爭的結果，購買者的中國人雖然得到了一時的小便宜，但為時却甚暫，不久之後不是競爭者彼此妥協了，便是依舊歸於一統，中國人還是捏着鼻頭喝酸醋，做了喫黃連的啞子。</p>
<p>這樣的例子是太多的，近一些的，就有不久之前的“煤油戰”，最近，則因為各處來貨缺乏，報紙的價格又告暴漲了。</p>
<p>報紙的來源，“十年前國人所銷之報紙，多來自瑞典腦威；自加拿大報紙進口傾銷，瑞腦兩國之貨，遂爾減少進口，三年前，因德國商行受德政府施用匯兌貼價政策之赐，亦將報紙運華傾銷，於是互相競爭，價格有跌無升”。在這樣“有跌無升”中，中國總算暫時的用到了一些便宜貨。“今則加拿大報紙，自六月至十二月之半年中，無貨進口，探詢原因，則被東鄰日本包定半年，該地紙廠出品之木漿紙張全數改運日本，大部份充製造軍需品之用；又聞此後加拿大紙廠出品之報紙，供給美國，已感不足，當無法再運亞洲推銷也。歐洲所產報紙，自木漿採作軍用之後，紙張產量，亦因而減少，目前歐洲自身，對報紙已大感缺乏，近期貨，各廠已拋售一空，遠期貨，須待明年十月後，方有出品，但數量有限，並不甚多。由是言之，新聞紙價格，尚有續漲可能。”</p>
<p>在這“尚有續漲可能”聲中，我們實在已沒有把文化工具改為殺人的軍需品的感慨的餘暇。而據紙業界人士云：“倘今後歐美各國報紙果然減少進口，不能僅量供吾國人之用，則東貨報紙，或將重復由鴨綠江運來，……據傳，如果報紙售價，每令再漲二三角，實售五元二三角時，則本市天章透紙廠，卽擬添造報紙，因報紙原料，可以稻草破布紙屑以代木漿，昔年該廠曾試造成功，惜因成本關係，不能與外貨競售而停造，近頃售價已漸抬高，倘有利可圖，自當恢復舊觀，貫澈初衷，以符實業救國之旨云”。</p>
<p>因為來源缺乏而給國貨報紙一個抬頭的機會，這不能不說是“塞翁失馬，安知非福”，但也不容我們太高興，第一，這“添造”必需要等“再漲二三角”，不然恐怕還是“不能與外貨競售”；第二，那是屬於將來的，但問題也更大，那就是將來加拿大或德國報紙再來傾銷又怎樣呢？他們的報紙是曾賣過三元一令的。</p>
<p>三元和五元二三角比較起來，那數目相差幾達一倍，然而中國的造紙工業却要到五元二三角才“有利可圖”，這不待我們仔細想，已着實使我們擔心不置了，如果在這唯一的機會中我們還不能把出品改良，成本減低，那不消說等人家來傾銷，就是各方面的需要減退些時，我們的出品還是會無人問津的。</p>
<p>何況，目前的問題還並不止此，在歐美的報紙減少進口時，東貨報紙還將重復由鴨綠江而來呢！</p>
<p>而要大量的製造報紙，稻草破布紙屑以代木漿，顯然也是不够的，報的原料還得有廣大的森林，而說起森林，却又不由人不想起東北來。</p>
<p>中國民族工業的興起和建立，和整個中國國運原是不能分開的。</p>
<h3>傳敎者</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>香港漫筆</p>
<p>不知不覺的養成了一種習慣，每次爬山回來經過營盤道時，總要走進山腰上的公園中休息一會兒。這里有鮮艷的花草，肥綠的椰子樹；有扶肩抱腰的雙雙情侶（那都是碧眼兒），滿頭鬍鬚的紅頭阿三；也有成羣成堆的種族不同的孩子們，在玩看蹻蹻板，翻沙倒土，愉快的活潑的情調充滿着這整個園子，那會很快很快的就使人忘記了過度的疲乏。</p>
<p>獨自跑到樅樹底下，悄悄的看着小說，不知怎麼啦，心一靜下就可以清楚的聽到山澗的叮咚奔泉，彷彿音樂似的把我吸引住了。於是合上書本，倚身在樹幹上，側耳聽着泉響，有時也發痴的望着北面海上的船帆，在水天一色的景象中泊漂着。</p>
<p>忽然一陣笑聲從背後冲過來，使我吃驚的回轉身去，原來是一個黑衣白帽的女傳道者，圍着一羣半壯的孩子，他們在那片平坦的綠草地上站住，女傳道者耐心的在給他們講着“天主”，孩子們老老實實的聽着，看去很像一個牧羊少女站在羊羣中。我為了好奇心的驅使，也跑到那里，聽她講些什麼？她絲毫沒注意我，自然也沒有因我的突然的跑來所驚奇。她是個年輕的少女，白帽下藏着細膩白凈的面龐，長濃的睫毛在白金絲邊的眼鏡下不住的閃動。嘴唇一直沒有停止工作，流利的廣州話簡直不能使我相信她是“盎格魯撒遜”。</p>
<p>“天主時時刻刻在看着你，你的罪惡是瞞不住天主的！你們都是好孩子！要聽話，要信天主，聽天主的吩咐！………”</p>
<p>羔羊般的孩子們，全是中國人，不，我還看見有兩個印度人在內。他們都仰着天眞無知的臉在聽着。他們沒有疑惑，也沒有畏怯，顯然的他們見慣了這類外國人，聽慣了這種話。</p>
<p>“中國人和印度人最喜歡犯罪！你們要相信上帝，老老寶實的做人，別人打你不要回手，那是他自己造罪孽！死後要進地獄！上帝是頂公平不過，他把犯罪的人送到地獄里懲罰，把行善的人帶進天堂，享幸福和快樂！你們聽從上帝的話，不要野蠻啊！……”</p>
<p>一個學生模樣的孩子突然的發問：</p>
<p>“英國人也犯罪呀！他們常常打中國人和印度人，昨天街上還有一個中國呌化子活活給英國兵踢死呢？那不是犯罪嗎？不是野蠻嗎？上帝怎麼不懲罰他呢？中國人和印度人從來不敢打外國人，可是外國人動不動就欺侮中國人和印度人，怎麼上帝不管？還說上帝公平？”</p>
<p>她立刻去抱住那個半壯的孩子的頭，和悅的吻他的兩頬：</p>
<p>“可愛的孩子！那是天主的意思，一定是那個呌化子犯了不可饒恕的罪，所以上帝要懲罰他，讓那個良善的英國人治他的罪。他雖然死了，可是他的罪已經贖了！他可以進天堂，我為他祝福（在身前劃十字，）你記住自己別犯罪呀：別得罪上帝！”</p>
<p>於是他拿出一包糖果分散給孩子們吃，她帶笑的問：</p>
<p>“糖好吃不好吃？”</p>
<p>“好吃！”孩子們的回答。</p>
<p>“這是天主賜給你們的！相信天主就常常有糖吃！”</p>
<p>我帶着氣忿離開了那里，重新回到所坐的地方，公園里的人愈多了，馬來人吹着口哨，尾隨在外國水兵的身後。我想着那傳敎的一幕，外國人的侵略都有精密的具體計劃，他們用種種方法來欺侮中國人，壓迫殖民地，更用麻醉的手段使殖民地的奴隸們不得覺醒！</p>
<h3>千佛山</h3>
<p>— 馬蜂</p>
<p>小的時候，每個舊曆年的初一，總是穿上新的衣服，在拜過年，落到一些“押歲錢”，到趵突泉商塲上逛着玩去，買些洋茄子，木刀，木槍，鬼臉……回到家去。在那時候，可以聽到“擺實”的人，抽着竹籤喊：</p>
<p>“一號籤來一張弓，自袍薛仁貴去征東！”</p>
<p>“九號籤來九月九，千佛山上去喝酒：你裝酒來我裝菜，南陽湖里的鹹鴨蛋！”</p>
<p>現在這喊聲聽不到了。“賣攤”也看不見了。不過九月九日，“千佛山上去喝酒”的事，在濟南還是有；而且當作種盛大的節會。</p>
<p>走出南圍子門，千佛山就現在眼前了。牠的東邊和西邊起伏着好多座山，有名頭的是東邊的橛山。橛山上邊有座橛形的塔，傳說這橛子是栓船的地方，整個的濟南城是座船；細想起來是很有味的。趕腳的驢子成行地栓在路旁的樹上，低着頭不聲響地等候牠底主人為牠找到的顧客。逛山的人們擠得氣都喘不上來。大人的吆呼，小孩的啼哭，笑聲，賣東西的喊聲，交織成大的波浪在瀰漫着的塵土里充塞。人羣像海浪似地在滾動；在那分不清誰是誰來的人浪里，只清楚地看到警察的黑色白骨的帽子，和他高舉起來打人的手。</p>
<p>到山上去的路，婉蜒地像條黃色的帶子。路的兩旁堆聚着賣東西的小販，而這些賣東西的里邊生意最好的是賣“荷柿”的。柿上在山東是種特產，“荷柿”是在柿子里邊最呌著名的。重陽節到千佛山去，人們差不多是為了買牠。在人們嘴里說着，——</p>
<p>“上山買荷柿，下山買蓋柿。”</p>
<p>想一下就可以曉得了。從千佛上回去的人，都提着一大提簍荷柿，像繫蟹子一樣，一個捱着一個。價錢也便宜，六七分錢就可以買十隻，而且送人是件好禮物呢。</p>
<p>一路上茶棚很多，差不多都附帶着賣银泊，黃表，香一類祀神的東西，上山來了愿的人，可也不少呢。</p>
<p>上山的西路，在近寺院的地方，有個朱色油漆着的木牌坊，上邊刻寫着“齊烟九點”四個字，看這四個字自然是沒什麼看頭——回頭看：有九點黑星突起在濟南城底四週起伏着，那是一座一座的山啊。</p>
<p>重陽節這天，寺院裹的香火是很盛的，一走進寺院，瀰佈看的烟氣，就使人感到不舒服了。院子裹的山壁上刻畫着很多的佛像，“千佛山”的名子，就是為的這個。後院的佛殿供着一位什麼奶奶，娘們家在那裹燒香的很多，佛殿裹有很事帶着紅繩的呢娃娃！——你知道這是什麼？</p>
<p>“拴娃娃啊！”</p>
<p>一般迷信的人，為了求子嗣，常常這樣作。也不知怎樣鬧的，去“栓娃娃”的女人，總是偷偷摸摸地，“栓”到的“娃娃”也很機密地收藏起來帶回家去！</p>
<p>上山的人差不多不走到上頂就回去了。他們知不知道“千佛山”的美景全在山頂上！——在山頂上除却更清晰地看到“齊烟九點”；還看到那離這裹有四十里地的黃河，像黃絲帶般地在亮晶晶地現着；那洛口黃河鐵橋，像隻大黑娛蚣似地橫臥在河上。整個濟南城是個小孩們滾的鐵環，寂靜地躺在那裹！上山和下山的人就像螞蟻樣在蠕動。</p>
<p>在以前：重陽節的千佛山，是些不安分的年青小伙子和姑娘們“吊膀子”的地方。現在呢？千佛山是那些青年學生，蜜絲們談情話的地方了。</p>
<h3>上海貧民庇寒所訪問記（下）</h3>
<p>— 李彩華</p>
<p>“那末他們的日常生活怎樣？”</p>
<p>“他們的生活很有規律，入所之後，就把他們十三人編為一班，每班設班長一人，（由他們自己推選，）處理他們一切日常事情，每日三餐，二粥一飯，一人一菜，上午六時早餐，十二時午餐，下午五時晚餐，飯時由班長照料在原有塲所就食，無桌無椅。平時授以教育，兒童亦定時上課讀書。”</p>
<p>“貴所貧民大都是何種職業？何省人最多？”</p>
<p>“最多的是小工和無家可歸的乞丐，籍貫以浙江和湖南兩省人最多。”</p>
<p>“貴所組織如何？有無醫藥的設備？”</p>
<p>“敝所組織分總務，文書，管理，登記，衛生五組，每組服務員多數盡義務。至於有無醫藥設備，我們略備簡易藥品。遇有病人，卽行隔離，重病送醫院，每天由上海醫院醫生來所診病，如遇死亡，則送輔元堂，今年共有病人三十多人，以寒熱病最多，死亡者約三四人。”</p>
<p>談話到這裹，陳君忙着處理別的事情，就請他介紹一位貧民談話。</p>
<p>歸途中，我想着三個問題：</p>
<p>第一，三四個月的庇寒時間，可以給他們做些生產工作，一方面增加所方經費，一方面又可養成他們自立的習慣，同時還可使他們獲得一生產技藝。消極的救濟，不如積極的來得有效。</p>
<p>第二，貧民入所時，應請醫生檢騐身體，有毒物嗜好者送戒烟醫院，有病的以病的種類隔離醫治。</p>
<p>第三，這末多人住在一起，沒有大批門窗，自然裹面的混濁空氣不能和外面新鮮空氣互通，我想是極容易促成疾病的，除多設窗戶外，或每天領他們出外散步一二次。（完）</p>

<h3>聯華攝影塲花絮</h3>
<p>「天作之合」中韓蘭根的父親母親和兒子，祖孫三代同上鏡頭，韓父母的表情忽悲忽喜，當然是韓派老滑稽，韓子也天生活潑，不愧將門之子。</p>
<p>「天作之合」中韓蘭根與白璐在鞦韆架上蕩鞦韆，韓乘飄蕩之際與白璐頻頻接吻，大吃荳腐，白璐欲避不能，損失不貲。</p>
<p>「春到人間」中外景，孫瑜領導陳燕燕梅熹韓蘭根劉繼羣等一行十餘人赴杭州，工作一星期，已全拍完，各人都備載春風而回，得意之色，溢於眉宇。</p>
<p>「春到人間」中之陳燕燕，比「孤城列女」中之陳燕燕，演技之更精彩，藝術上有顯著之進歩。</p>
<p>「將軍之女」中黎灼灼挾李淸圖越出虎穴，由屋頂躍跨馬背絶塵而去，演來有古女俠士風味。</p>
<h3>新人謝俊</h3>
<p>在兩部新片中</p>

<h3>一九三七年式新道奇車不日展覽</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>道奇出品。索安全可靠。著稱於世。今則一九三七年式新道奇汽車。因由多數工程專家。依據歷年經騐。悉心設計構製而成。故除保持道奇傳統的一切優點外。其改良盡善之流綫式樣。且使其外觀益臻美妙。彌極動人。至於內部。則其機力之瀰滿。與效用之宏偉。固皆有顯著進步。卽車身之寬敞舒暢，與駕駛之安全可靠。且亦莫不駕以前出品面上之。新道奇在實際上雖屬一絕對經濟合算之低價汽車。但其價值。所以不僅為同類車所不逮。抑且堪與其他中價車相匹敵者。其原因無他。蓋卽以其於任何方面。均能獨具特色。最擅勝塲故耳。說者謂道奇新車。既以若斯之嶄新姿態。與如許特長。出現於汽車市塲。則其為一般人所熱烈歡迎而樂於駕用。自可斷言也。</p>
<p>新車計分兩大陣綫。卽道奇六汽缸車。與道奇特麗六汽缸車是也。茲者此項新車。業由華中獨家經理。卽本埠靜安寺路中國汽車公司。裝運來申。刻正積極從事於新車之裝配。及一切佈置事宜。以便於本月十五日起。至十七日止。陳列於該公司樣子間。作公開展覽三天。以與滬人士作初次之相見。屆時本埠汽車界。定將大為轟動。而恐後爭先連袂偕往。以冀先覩為快。爰亟於正式展覽之先。以其概况略述如次。以供愛好道奇新車者之參考。</p>
<p>新道奇汽車車身。係以整幅鋼料構成。而車頂亦卽為此整個全鋼構造之一部。堅強鞏固。得未曾有。車門與車窗之上。並皆裝有滴簷。所以便雨天行車也。新車水箱格屏之中央。飾以鍍克羅咪之平行綫條。益臻秀麗。彌壯觀瞻。至於車身。因其前後部份綫條。均極美觀悅目。漂亮動人。故其外視之美妙壯麗。有非一般車輛所可相提並論者。新車車門加闊。進出彌便。車座高如靠椅。並已加闊。計前座為四十七寸。後座期達四十八寸半。內部地位寬宏。足供六人乘坐。胥極舒暢適意之至。前座後方之頂部。裝有海綿橡皮填製之安全轉棍。所以保護後方乘客。尤其是幼童。俾於車輛突然停頓時。不致有撞碰危險也。再因採用特種後輪軸。故後廂底板面積悉平。毫無凹凸不平之弊。後窗為分隔式。車頂燈卽安置於其上。</p>
<p>關於安全方面。新車所具優點。不勝枚舉。試略言之。計有下列數端。新車上所裝置之表板。不僅式樣新穎漂亮。抑且安全無比。蓋其上絕無凸出於外之球形物或撳鈕等。甚至如發火鍵。現亦退隱於密。而與表板全面完全相平。全鋼安全車身。現係架置於橡皮墊襯之架擋上。故凡金屬物與金屬物相接觸之弊。今已完全避免。至於絕對均衡之重量分配。及諧動彈簧系。有裨於新車之乘坐安適者。實匪淺鮮。引擎茲已移向較前部份。前後座亦均移前。故後座乘客坐處。恰在後軸之首。而彈簧所承儎之重量。因而可以勻配於前後再新車所用之半橢圓形特長彈簧。係以愛穆拉鋼精工構成。前彈簧且係钩連於前方。而非如曩昔之钩連於後方。故轉向尤為靈便。新車上所裝用之吸震裝置。與飛機上所裝者－般無二。故其效用尤宏。新車引擎內徑三寸又四分之一。衝程四寸又八分之三。馬力八十七匹。一切原有特色。如素著盛名之道奇全長汽缸保冷系。鋼質汽門座。壓力潤滑。四環鋁質活塞。自動火花。自動阻風等等。新車并皆齊備。塞車為眞正油壓式。其使用之靈便。功用之準確。早已膾炙衆口。而道奇之所以具有停駛絕對安全之特色。蓋卽此項設備有以致之。按道奇工程師對於油壓塞車之應用。由來已久。迄於今茲。蓋已具有八年以上之經騐矣。</p>
<p>至於底盤方面。新道奇汽車之特色尤多。其中如專利式之浮動力引擎托架。諧動無聲變速機。駕駛人踏腳地位之增大。流綫化鋼車輪。獨立停放塞車。轎車後廂可加裝收音機擴聲器等。蓋皆其犖犖大者也。新道奇六汽缸車。輪距一一二寸。裝配七十八匹馬力引擎。斯為低價類汽車。至於特麗式六汽缸車。輪距一一五寸。其所裝配之引擎。馬力則為八十二匹云。</p>
<h3>準科學化的造車研究方式</h3>
<p>— 韻</p>
<p>近代的汽車製造方法。完全是一種依靠於科學方式的。無論在結構。在引擎，在式樣等上。都是基於不斷的試騐而完成的。誠如哇爾特斯摩別爾公司總理麥克漢氏所說。“汽車製造的研究方式。已經完全達於準科學化了。”麥氏又說。關於研究一點。所包括的範圍很大，其中最重要的厥為研究公衆所寗取的風尚。其次為化騐室中的研究工作。和試騐部及證騐塲等的設備。如果要求所造的汽車十全十美。那末這些關於研究上的主要工作。都是一件也缺不得的。</p>
<p>汽車買衆的風尚研究。這種設備。比較的還算新。單就通用汽車公司而論。他們這一部份的工作也是很佔重要地位的。由於這一項工作的完成。廠方才能澈底了解汽車購衆所需要的是些怎樣的汽車。他們便依照了市塲上所需的進行工作。這樣子至少可以避免“閉戶造車”之譏了。</p>
<p>這一個徵求公衆意見的研究工作。很像政治上的選舉塲。是集合各方面的意旨為意旨的，所以在這一部的工作之中。包括着一種徵求各方面意見的步驟。他們把一種詳細分目的問題表格。分送給許多的車主。把他們的意見分門別類加以分析。所得的結果。作為工程師們改革時的目標。近年來購衆與機構的研究總和。已成為車身車架和摩托改進的前驅。並且今後沒有改進則已。如有更動。必且將這個標的作為準則。</p>
<p>由於公衆所寗取的風尚為導引。這是由於向公衆諮詢。和從銷路方面所獲得的。這種改進方式便將一年一年的繼續下去。這不是一個人所能獲得的。也不是一部份人所得而改進的。除了從研究工作入手。再加以機師們的悉心試騐。是無從到達成功之門的。所謂“天才是不斷的刻苦所造成。”這句話是一些不錯的呀。譬如說。在汽車工廠的化騐室中。我們常可以看到機師們中書下做的試騐一種機件。像一個唧筒。早已被認為很完美的了。可是還要精益求精。一個機師在萬分之一的一英寸的唧筒上要試之又試。量之再量。其目的無非想發現更能發生效率的唧筒而已。</p>
<p>汽車機件中的任何一部份。在製造的過程中都要經過這樣的研究工作。除了唧筒之外。像化汽機。引擎墊。車軸。槓桿等。無一不是如此。因為除了準科學方法之外。是沒有別種捷徑可尋的。通用廠的證騐塲中有各種高低不平。優劣互異的道路。有經騐的試騐駕駛人把試騐用的模型車。走着幾千萬里的路程。眞到認為滿意的時候。這新型車方纔宣佈於大衆呢。</p>

<p>[Xuzhou] Military News: Miao Chenglieu's troops were transferred from Weinan on the 8th and 9th to the north bank of the Wei River, where they have already clashed with the outposts of Feng Qinzai's army. Furthermore, the generals in Zhang Xueliang's army in Xi'an are unwilling to listen to Yang Hucheng's command, and have recently been in disagreement with Yang, taking precautions against each other. The situation in Xi'an is dire, and the people are terrified. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] The political organs in Xi'an are now effectively controlled by communists. There is widespread belief that the position of foreigners in the area is rapidly becoming untenable. Although there are plans for a complete evacuation, various transportation difficulties are hindering this action, as sections of the Longhai Railway east of Xi'an have had rails and bridges destroyed by mutinous troops. Personnel from the British and American embassies in Xi'an are planning to find a way to use long-distance buses to evacuate foreigners. According to Chinese sources, the vanguard troops of Zhu and Mao's communist bandits have appeared within five miles of Xi'an. According to Chinese bankers and industrialists who departed from Xi'an on January 7th and have now arrived in Nanjing, the main forces of the Red Army have reached Sanyuan, thirty miles from Xi'an. The situation in Xi'an is rapidly deteriorating, with prices soaring. Flour is currently selling for one yuan per bag. Foreign newspapers are prohibited, so the residents of Xi'an are completely unaware of the external situation. The military situation in Shaanxi is extremely chaotic. It is rumored that Yang Hucheng, due to discord with Zhang Xueliang's troops, has moved his headquarters to Lintong. The general public fears that Yang's troops will ally with the communist bandits. At the same time, the Central Army continues to advance gradually along the Longhai Railway. It is reported that this army is commanded by Feng Qinzai, and it is also claimed that Feng's troops have clashed with the mutinous troops several times. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<h3>A Certain Central Official Flees from Lanzhou to Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Order in Lanzhou is Greatly Disrupted, Leftist Elements are Extremely Active; Northeastern Army in Weinan and Chishui are Extremely Busy Constructing Fortifications</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] A certain Central Government official from Gansu Province escaped from Lanzhou in disguise and arrived in Xuzhou on the 12th, then transferred to Nanjing to report to the Central Government. According to him, during the incident on the evening of the 12th of last month in Lanzhou, the Pacification Commissioner's office and the Central Government agencies' garrison offices were surrounded, and resistance lasted all night. By noon on the 13th, they had all surrendered. Wang Shihui, the Director of the Pacification Commissioner's Finance Office, died a martyr. Hundreds of officers and soldiers were killed or wounded. More than 300 Northeastern Army officers and soldiers were also killed or wounded. Robbery, rape, and murder continued for days, and order was greatly disrupted. Yu Xuezhong, accompanied by the division commanders, flew back from Shaanxi on the 15th, concentrated his troops, and appointed Li Zhentang as the City Defense Commander. On the 20th, he released more than 900 captured bandits. Deng Baoshan's army headquarters was inside the city, and many Central Government personnel were sheltered by it. Leftist elements are extremely active, forcing the various schools to form illegal organizations. I left Lanzhou and came east on the 4th. Yu's 50th Army, consisting of the three divisions of Ji Mouzhong, Li Zhentang, and Zhou Guanglie, was stationed in the provincial capital and distributed along the Xi'an-Lanzhou Road. I took a car for two days to Xi'an. The various armies along the way checked extremely strictly. The Xi'an-Lanzhou Road has not yet been opened to traffic. Because I had a military pass, I arrived in Shaanxi the first time. Yang Hucheng also issued a circular telegram, which was full of absurdities. I left Shaanxi at noon on the 7th and was blocked passing Chishui, where more than a thousand people gathered seeking refuge, spending the night out in the open under fire, and being searched six times by the Northeastern Army. It was not until the morning of the 9th that I was allowed to pass. Liu Duoquan's troops are in the Chishui area, Miao Zhengliut's troops were transferred from Weinan to the north of the Wei River, and Wang Yizhe's troops guarded the provincial capital. The Northeastern Army in Weinan and Chishui are extremely busy constructing fortifications. The first line is burying landmines, the second line is an electric fence, the third line is trenches, the fourth line is an electric fence, the fifth line is trenches, and the sixth line is artillery positions. The Northeastern Army's defense zone and the people in the front line have all fled. The discipline of the army is poor, and the people are constantly resisting, hoping that the Central Government will quickly quell the chaos in Shaanxi and Gansu. I will go to Nanjing to report everything. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Yang's Representative, Li Zhigang, Leaves Nanjing and Flies to Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Yang Hucheng's representative, Li Zhigang, took the Eurasia No. 7 aircraft from Nanjing via Zhengzhou to Shaanxi at noon on the 12th. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] President Yu completed his public duties in Shanghai and returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. He immediately met with Yang Hucheng's representative, Li Zhigang, and told him about the Central Government's leniency in handling the aftermath in the Northwest, ordering him to return to Shaanxi and tell Yang to obey the Central Government's orders immediately. Li then flew to Shaanxi by plane at 8 PM. Yu then met with Wang Luyi to listen to reports on hospital affairs and matters relating to the drafting of reports for the Third Plenary Session. He then went with Wang Luyi to the Chinese Funeral Home to pay respects to the eight martyrs who died in the Xi'an Incident, bowing to their spirits with great sorrow. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>The False Bandit Army is Very Busy Replenishing Troops</h3>
<p>Li Shouxin's Troops are Transferred to Duolun</p>
<p>[Guihua] The report received here on the evening of the 11th stated that the Jiabusizi Conference decided that the false army would launch a major offensive against Sui before the lunar new year. If there are no achievements, all the bandit leaders will be dismissed and severely punished. The false army is now actively preparing everything and an offensive is feared soon. The National Army on the Sui East front has increased alert. The generals are inspecting, and defenses are being redeployed. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Datong: The bandit puppet army in Northern Chahar has recently been mobilizing and reorganizing. The total number of the bandit puppet army is no more than 20,000. The bandits have been very busy with transporting and replenishing supplies these days. A certain party has again ordered 2,000 tons of coal and 10,000 boxes of gasoline for military preparations. The target of the bandits is Sui Dong, centered on Nanjiaoqian, Shangdu, and Daqinggou. These places have fortified defenses. The traitor Li Shouxin is currently in Zhangbei, appearing very depressed. More than 1,000 of Zhang Wanqing's remaining troops are stationed in Nanjiaoqian. Wang Ying is still in the city of Shangdu. Three thousand soldiers of the new pseudo-Xingan Army, which came from the eastern border, are stationed in Kangbao and Baochang. Their discipline is non-existent, and most residents have fled. Wang Ying and other bandits have now renamed themselves the "Xinghan Army" (Central News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] A certain party, suspecting that Li Shouxin's troops are unstable and to prevent defection, has begun to transfer them to the Duolun area for training. However, the air of defection within Li's troops is still very strong. Wang Ying is still in Shangdu, actively expanding his troops. According to reliable sources, the pseudo-bandit army has recently built a defense project of more than two hundred li from Kangbao to Shangdu, to defend against a flanking attack by the Sui army from the west, and is actively conscripting laborers. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Jining telegram: The civilian food stored in the six counties of Northern Chahar has been completely plundered by the pseudo-Mongolians, and there is no fuel left. Residents eat chaff and bran every day and burn cow and horse dung for warmth. The population has fled and migrated. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Zeng Yan Yi and Jin Xianzhang came to Sui from the Wuchuan defense area on the 12th to welcome Qin Shaoguan, the special commissioner for inspecting the defecting troops sent by Yan Xishan. According to Jin, Zeng Yan Yi has completed the inspection of his troops. After Commissioner Qin pays respects to Chairman Chuan in three or two days, they will go to Wuchuan together for re-inspection. He also said that his troops will be transferred to other places for training after all inspection procedures are completed. (Central News dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Five hundred soldiers from the pseudo-army Zhang Junzhe's unit, stationed in Rehe, arrived in Guyuan on the 7th via Tai Ge and Wuyuangou in the Rehe territory. They also recruited more than two hundred Mongolian bandits in the Eastern League, fully equipped with guns and horses. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Arrives in Hong Kong Yesterday on His Way North</h3>
<p>Jiang Telegraphed Wang Asking Him to Go to Nanjing Immediately; Wang Issues Statement Upon Arriving in Hong Kong</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Wang Jingwei arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 12th, accompanied by Chen Bijun, Zeng Zhongming, Chen Yaozu, and others. More than a thousand representatives from various parties boarded the ship to welcome him. Wang made a brief statement, saying that he had left the country for medical treatment and was returning in response to a summons. As he had been away from the country for a long time, he would only be able to make a contribution after meeting with key figures in Nanjing. Wang did not disembark. The original ship headed north at 4 PM. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Chairman Wang and his wife, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, Chen Yaozu, and others, arrived in Hong Kong at 6 AM on the 12th aboard the German mail ship "Potsdam" on their way back to the country. Central representatives Shao Lizhi, Zhou Fo Hai, Zhou Qigang; Chairman Jiang's representative Luo Zhuoying; Yu Hanmou; Huang Musong's representative Li Xuan; Li Langru; Yue Provincial Government's Wang Yingyu; Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters' Deng Yanhua, Chen Ce, Zhong Tianxin, Yu Junxian; Gui Sui Office's Kan Zonghua; and Li Wenfan, Peng Xuepei, Diao Zuqian, Hu Mulan, and more than a hundred representatives from various groups went to the pier to welcome him. Chairman Wang was in good spirits, his face was fuller than when he left the country, and he had a kind smile. He shook hands with the greeters one by one as a courtesy. When he met Ms. Hu Mulan, he could not help but sigh at the death of Mr. Hu, and Hu could not help but feel sad and tear up. Wang, feeling tired from the wind and waves along the way, did not disembark and declined all banquets from the Hong Kong Governor and overseas Chinese groups. He scheduled a meeting with reporters at 4 PM to issue a statement, and at 5 PM, he and Shao, Zhou, and others headed north on the original ship. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] At noon on the 12th, Chairman Wang personally wrote a statement on the ship and gave it to the Central News Agency for publication. The original text is as follows: "When I disembarked in Genoa on December 22nd of last year, I issued a statement. When I passed through Singapore on January 6th of this year, I issued another statement. Both of these statements were written and signed by me as evidence. There are no other opinions expressed besides these. The reason I went to Europe this time was for medical treatment, and the reason for my return is for urgent needs. Although there are many important issues at present, after a long journey home, I must first fully exchange opinions with my colleagues in the Central Government before reaching a conclusion. Wang Jingwei, January 12th." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] In addition to issuing a written statement, Chairman Wang also met with Chinese and foreign reporters on the "Potsdam" at 4 PM on the 12th and issued a statement, saying, "I went abroad last year for medical treatment, and this time I return for urgent needs. Regarding the aftermath of the Xi'an Incident, Yang Hucheng should obey the Central Government. As for the future of the world, there is no doubt that it should move towards the path of peace. The national conditions of various countries are different, and the national policies adopted are also different. Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People are most suitable for our national conditions, and we should strive to work according to the Premier's legacy of the Three Principles of the People. The future of the country and the nation is not far away." When asked about the Sino-Japanese issue, the Second Plenary Session of last year had a thorough answer. If we reach the time of sacrifice, we will not be afraid to sacrifice. What the Second Plenary Session declared to us is meaningful and resolute. I have been separated from Mr. Jiang for a long time, and I am eager to meet and express my longing. As for the meeting place, it will depend on Mr. Jiang's health. If Mr. Jiang is still recuperating in Fenghua, I will visit him in Fenghua. In short, all future issues must wait until I return to Nanjing and fully exchange views with my central colleagues before I can offer any suggestions."

<h3>Ambassador Guo Speaks in London About the Current Situation in China</h3>
<p>The Government's Prestige Has Increased, and the Whole Country Has Completed Unification; Chamberlain Says that England Has No Ambition to Expand Its Territory in China</p>
<p>[London] The Chinese Ambassador to London, Guo Taiqi, gave a speech at a banquet held by the Chinese Association here tonight, stating that the recent resolution of the Xi'an Incident has increased the prestige of Chairman Jiang and the entire Chinese government, which is welcomed by the friends of China and the Chinese people. China now feels that great, lasting, and beneficial reforms can be achieved quickly. The whole of China now has a new hope and new confidence, as China is gradually moving towards political unity across the nation, and not just limited to race. He continued that Sino-British affairs, whether in taste, culture, or world peace, have been intertwined and deeply rooted in the Far East and cannot be separated. Former British politician Austin Chamberlain then gave a speech, saying that of all the undeveloped markets that can be seen in the world today, none are like China. The strength, unity, good neighborliness, and development of China by its own government are of great benefit to all countries in the world. The British have no ambition to add an inch of land outside of the land where they already recognize the sovereignty of the British Emperor. We British have no territorial ambition and no intention of encroaching on the Chinese government. We are in China, even more so than elsewhere, simply as a country doing business. We wish to trade with the Chinese, and we regard the unity, integrity, strength, and authority of the Chinese government as necessary for the attainment of our goals, which is as urgent as yours. Zhang continued, saying that he did not believe that the relationship between China and Britain would be purely material, and that Britain only hoped for the expansion of trade. In fact, what we hope for goes beyond this. We earnestly hope to telegraph to a unified, prosperous, and trustworthy China that it can make a contribution to the development of the world, as no other country in the world can make such a contribution.

<h3>Germany, France, and the Moroccan Question</h3>
<p>— Auxiliary</p>
<p>Although the Spanish civil war has been going on for half a year, the outcome of the government forces versus the rebel forces has not yet been determined. The recent influx of volunteer soldiers from various countries into Spain has further internationalized the war on the Iberian Peninsula. However, the participation of volunteer soldiers and the import of military supplies only reflect the indirect struggle between the major European powers. Recently, Germany's active involvement in Morocco (such as the landing of large numbers of troops and the establishment of military fortresses) has created a direct conflict between France and Germany, making the European question surrounding the Spanish civil war even more serious. France has now ordered its troops stationed in Morocco to expand to wartime strength, and Defense Minister Daladier is scheduled to inspect the defenses in Morocco within a few days. French Deputy Foreign Minister De Saint-Quentin delivered a speech on the 10th, seriously warning Germany that "outsiders must understand that France will never succumb to coercion. Therefore, any display of military force, violation of treaties, or indirect infringement of French rights will sever the opportunity for a peaceful resolution." He clearly pointed out that France cannot tolerate Germany establishing a sphere of influence in North Africa.</p>
<p>Why is France so concerned about Germany's activities in Morocco? This has historical reasons. In the late 19th century, the scramble for colonies in Africa by European countries was very intense. However, the situation eased somewhat after the establishment of the Anglo-French Entente in 1904 and the Algeciras Conference in 1906. France's suzerainty in Morocco was also established from this point forward. However, Germany strongly opposed the development of French power in North Africa. Therefore, Germany took hostile actions in 1905, 1906, and 1909. In 1911, the serious Agadir Crisis occurred, which almost led to a major war. The event was eventually resolved through French concessions. After the outbreak of the European War and Germany's defeat, this issue was naturally temporarily resolved. However, since the rise of Germany in recent years and Hitler's rise to power, the scramble for colonies has returned to its former state. The Spanish civil war is an excellent opportunity for Germany to seize power in North Africa. Thus, the past conflict between France and Germany in Morocco has been rekindled.</p>
<p>The above is based on the past history of the struggle between France and Germany in Morocco. However, Germany is now active in Spanish Morocco. Why is France opposed to it? This also has historical reasons. Originally, the area of North African Morocco was a battleground for France and Spain. The long-standing disputes were resolved only after the signing of the Franco-Spanish Treaty of 1904, the Franco-Spanish Treaty of 1912, and the French-Moroccan Treaty. The Franco-Moroccan Treaty of 1912 stipulated that Morocco would be a French protectorate, but allowed part of its territory to be a Spanish sphere of influence. The Franco-Spanish Treaty of the same year stipulated that "the Spanish government guarantees that it will never transfer or abandon all or part of the Spanish sphere of influence within Morocco, even temporarily." According to the provisions of these treaties, France naturally does not allow the entry of German forces into Spanish Morocco, and believes that the recent developments in North Africa are of great importance to France.</p>
<p>Germany is currently denying their activities, claiming that this is communist propaganda. However, the facts are very clear. The British and French authorities had already exchanged intelligence about Germany's activities in North Africa in mid-January. Let us put aside Germany's ambitions for the moment and focus on the current situation in Morocco. France is extremely concerned. Because the rebel leader Franco, in order to gain the enthusiastic participation of the Moors, has promised to grant them great autonomy afterward. This has a very significant impact on the natives of French Morocco. If Germany continues to adopt a challenging policy, the European crisis will be further intensified.</p>

When Stalin, Molotov, Kalinin, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Ordzhonikidze, Andreev, and other party and government leaders attended, the entire venue greeted them with enthusiastic cheers. (11th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The 1937 Soviet Russian army budget is estimated to increase by approximately 35% compared to the figure for 1936. The estimated expenditure for 1937 is 20,102,000,000 rubles, compared to 14,815,000,000 rubles last year. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet Finance Commissar Grinko delivered a financial report at the regular meeting of the Central Executive Committee, stating the preliminary estimate of the Soviet Union in 1936, "The national budget approved last year was 78.715 billion rubles, of which the revenue part exceeded by 5.9% and the expenditure part by 3.8%. The revenue exceeded the expenditure by approximately 1.7 billion rubles, which can make investment in industry and trade more expanded."</p>
<p>Grinko continued to describe the achievements of various sectors of the national economy, claiming that they have exceeded the 1936 plan, with total profits of 14.5 billion rubles, compared to the original plan of 11.3 billion rubles. Grinko also stated that the general welfare of the country has improved, wages have increased, and the income of collective farms has also increased.</p>
<p>Regarding the estimated revenue part of the 1937 national budget, Grinko pointed out that the estimated revenue for this year is 97.7824 billion rubles, an increase of 14.390 billion rubles compared to last year, or 17.3%. The expenditure part is 96.832 billion rubles, an increase of 18.5% compared to last year. A large amount of funds this year will be used for three main businesses, namely national economic investment, improving the cultural and material conditions of laborers, and strengthening national defense. The capital construction expenditure for this year is 32.5 billion rubles.</p>
<p>To the long and enthusiastic applause of the entire meeting, Grinko reported that the funds listed under the National Defense Committee in this year's budget were 20.1022 billion rubles, compared to 14.9 billion rubles in 1936. Grinko pointed out that the increase in national defense expenditure is due to the increase in the strength of the Red Army last year, the large-scale development of heavy industry, and the establishment of the National Defense Industry Committee, which allows the Red Army to be equipped with the best and most expensive armaments, thus requiring an increase in expenditure. In addition, according to Grinko, the achievements of industry and agriculture have enabled the Red Army to increase the reserve amount of all supplies. At the same time, it is also necessary to increase the construction of warehouses, barracks, and residences for Red Army personnel.</p>
<p>Grinko continued to report on other expenditure items, pointing out that the education expenditure for this year is 18.5 billion rubles, compared to 13.9 billion rubles last year, and the health expenditure for this year is 7.5 billion rubles, compared to 5.8 billion rubles last year.</p>
<p>Grinko concluded, "This budget of nearly 100 billion rubles this year, and the budget of a rapidly growing socialist society, reflect the power and development of the Soviet state. The Soviet Union's rights of citizens stipulated in the greatest document of our time, the Stalinist Constitution, have been fully reflected in this number." (12th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Trotsky Arrives in Mexico City</h3>
<p>Resides in San Angel Inn</p>
<p>Mexico City: After the leader of the Soviet Communist anti-faction, Trotsky, and his wife arrived at the port of Tampico yesterday, they immediately took a train to Mexico City. They got off the train in Lechería and continued their journey by car, accompanied by two police officers for protection. They arrived in Coyoacán, near Mexico City, at 6:40 p.m. and stayed at the home of painter Diego Rivera (leader of the Trotskyist faction in Mexico). Rivera personally welcomed them at the door and immediately closed the door, not allowing reporters and photographers to enter. Rivera deliberately revealed a large handgun hidden in his pocket to show his intention to protect Trotsky. (11th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Former U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Submits Report</h3>
<p>U.S.-Philippine Business Conference: Advocate Early Convening</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt has submitted to Congress the report of Mr. Murphy, the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines. Mr. Murphy has resigned and been elected governor of Michigan. His report suggests that the U.S.-Philippine Business Conference should be convened as soon as possible to determine policies so that the Philippine government and business community can know what to follow before full independence. Mr. Murphy said that Philippine commerce has been minimally affected by the economic downturn and that society is stable. Although there was the disturbance of the Sakdal Party in mid-May of the previous year, it was unplanned, and only ignorant and foolish people blindly followed the party, believing that it could improve the economic situation and reform the corruption of government officials. Mr. Murphy also briefly described the course of his tenure, such as the election of the autonomous government and the establishment of laws, etc. As for trade with the United States, sugar and yarn are the main items. The Philippines' purchase of American yarn in 1932 accounted for 72% of the total, but in the second half of last year, it had dropped to 35%. Although the Gentlemen's Agreement between the United States and Japan is slightly beneficial to the United States, those familiar with the situation are afraid that Japanese cotton textiles will be replaced by Chinese goods, and Japan will specialize in the sale of rayon textiles. In this case, American cotton textiles will still be difficult to benefit from. Mr. Murphy concluded, "The current relationship between the American and Philippine people is very good. It is truly commendable that a nation and a dependency have such a relationship." (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>U.S. President Asks Congress to Allocate Funds</h3>
<p>For Public Works and Relief</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt has asked Congress to allocate US$790,000,000 for relief work before the end of June this year. He has also requested an allocation of $2,580,000 for unemployment relief during the same period. Compared to March of last year, the above figures have decreased by $800,000. However, the relief funds for the 250,000 drought victims are not included. These disaster victims have now been handed over to the Immigration Administration for resettlement. It is said that because there is no suitable work to be assigned, it has been decided to provide cash subsidies. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Another Kidnapping for Ransom Case Occurs in the U.S.; President Offers $10,000 Reward for Arrest of Criminals</h3>
<p>Ten-Year-Old Boy Beaten to Death; National Outrage; Arrest Efforts Intensified</p>
<p>[Washington] The U.S. government has offered a reward of $10,000 for the arrest of the criminals who kidnapped and murdered ten-year-old boy Madison Charlie. When announcing the reward, President Roosevelt said that the case had shocked the nation and that the arrest of the criminals would be carried out with all efforts, and they would not be allowed to go unpunished. These cruel criminals must be brought to justice. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Charlie, the ten-year-old son of Madison, a wealthy family in Idlewild, Tacoma, USA, was kidnapped from his home on December 27th last year. His body was found today in a forest six miles south of here. He was naked, and his skull was deeply fractured, apparently beaten to death with a heavy object. He has been identified by Mr. Madison's friend as Charlie. The body was discovered by Moro, a local resident, who was hunting nearby this morning. He rushed to report the terrible scene to the authorities. Federal agents have begun investigating. It is said that the body has not yet decomposed, so the death was recent. The main suspects are two offenders. After Charlie was kidnapped, his family received a notice demanding $28,000 in old banknotes for ransom and detailing the payment method. After receiving the letter, the family requested the police to stop interfering in order to redeem him. Unexpectedly, Charlie has been killed. This situation is very similar to the kidnapping of aviator Lindbergh's young son. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The cruelty of the situation surpasses the case four years ago of the kidnapping and murder for ransom of the newborn son of the famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh. Therefore, the people throughout the United States are extremely outraged. This time, the victim is Charlie, the ten-year-old son of Dr. Madison, a wealthy family in Tacoma. On December 27th last year, the boy was sitting at home with his twelve-year-old sister when a masked thug broke in, threatened them with a gun, and kidnapped the boy, leaving a letter demanding a ransom of US$28,000. Unexpectedly, the boy's body was recently found in the snow, his face covered in blood, all his teeth knocked out, and his head also had serious injuries. Judging from the situation, he was clearly beaten to death. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Tacoma, USA. Madison's close friend, Seff, told the Associated Press today that the family did not pay the kidnappers the ransom before Charlie was murdered because the kidnappers sent contradictory letters many times, and there was no way to figure out how to pay the ransom and get the ticket. It was impossible to start. The kidnappers were suspected of having a mental illness. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Tacoma, USA. It was learned today that federal agents have obtained clues to the kidnappers in the Madison young son Charlie murder case, but due to insufficient evidence, they have not been able to arrest them immediately. Whether there is one or several kidnappers is unknown. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Chicago. It was learned today that FBI Director Hoover is preparing to fly to Tacoma to personally investigate the Madison young son Charlie murder case. Hoover secretly left his hotel today and went elsewhere. It was learned from the airline that several federal secret agents had chartered a plane, but where they were flying to was not announced. Hoover is an American G-man with professional skill, who has solved many murder cases. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Miami, Florida. McFarlane, a famous American newspaper publisher, today offered a reward of $1,000 to arrest the kidnappers who murdered Charlie, the ten-year-old son of the wealthy Madison family in Tacoma. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Shipping Labor Strike Shows Hope for Resolution</h3>
<p>Sailors Agree to Arbitration; Auto Workers' Strike Turns Bloody</p>
<p>[Washington] The American shipping strike has brought national shipping to a standstill, greatly affecting foreign trade, and all related businesses have suffered significant losses. According to well-informed sources, it is expected that this strike will be resolved soon, or it is expected that the basis for resolution may be announced today. It is reported that the sailors have agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration, as the government has agreed to ask Congress to repeal a portion of the 1936 Shipping Act that is unfavorable to sailors. After the American shipping strike, foreign shipping companies have seen considerable development. The docks of American shipping companies in New York and other U.S. ports are now mostly used by British ships, with goods waiting to be shipped piled up like mountains. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Detroit. The American auto industry strike has worsened due to the breakdown of negotiations between labor and management and the increase in the number of strikers. Currently, the number of idle workers has reached 115,000. General Motors has closed its Oldsmobile plant, which has 9,000 workers, because strikes at other plants have caused a shortage of parts. A small disturbance occurred at the Pontiac plant today. Since the strike began, only this plant has not been affected by the strike. Today, a group of workers tried to occupy the plant and not work, but they were eventually driven out by the authorities. Strike leaders have gone to Washington to consult with Mr. Newhuis, chairman of the Industrial Group Committee, and Mr. McGrath, Undersecretary of Labor. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Flint, Michigan. Today, police and strike pickets clashed outside the Fisher Body plant here for twenty minutes, resulting in serious injuries to thirteen people and two police officers. This is the most serious incident since the General Motors workers' strike began. Most of the injuries were caused by gunshots, and all have been taken to the hospital for treatment. Police charged the picket line twice, but as the number of people gathered increased, they used tear gas to resist. Although the police made every effort, they were unable to disperse the demonstrating crowd by midnight. Therefore, Michigan Governor Murphy ordered a team of National Guard to be dispatched to suppress the violence and prevent further bloodshed. At the same time, due to the breakdown of negotiations between labor and management, many personnel in the automobile industry have given up their work. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>France and Germany Mutually Guarantee Respect for Spanish Territory</h3>
<p>French Ambassador Returns Home After Meeting with Hitler; Schacht to Be Invited to France for Negotiations; Tensions Between the Two Countries Ease</p>
<p>[Paris] In the past week, Franco-German relations had reached their worst level since the Nazi Party came to power, but the current tense situation has clearly begun to ease. There are two main reasons: (1) German leader Hitler and French Ambassador to Germany Poncet have mutually guaranteed respect for the territorial integrity of Spain and Spanish Morocco; (2) Spanish Captain Pegbider, representing the Nationalists, has replied to France, stating that no foreign troops are stationed in Spanish Morocco, nor will any be deployed there. France is satisfied with Pegbider's reply. A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry announced today that he did not believe any serious crisis had occurred. Those in charge believe that the number of German troops landing in Morocco as reported by the French press is exaggerated. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] This morning, German leader Hitler received the diplomatic corps and assured French Ambassador to Germany Poncet that Germany did not intend to infringe upon the territorial integrity of Spain and its territories. Poncet immediately stated to Hitler in the name of the French government that France was determined to respect the territorial integrity of Spain and the status of Spanish Morocco within the scope of the existing treaties. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The mutual guarantee by German Chancellor Hitler and French Ambassador Poncet of the integrity of Spain and its territories has been confirmed by those in charge. Political circles believe that Hitler's declaration to the diplomatic corps can be seen as an affirmation of peace and is therefore highly valued. Satisfaction has also been expressed here with the French Ambassador's declaration, as this declaration indicates that the French government did not participate in the anti-German propaganda in the French press in recent days. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Colonel Pegbider, acting High Commissioner of Spanish Morocco, has issued safe conduct passes to French Military Attaché in Tangier, Captain Rouché, allowing him to travel freely in Spanish Morocco, including the ports of Melilla and Ceuta. The French are quite satisfied with this move by the Spanish Nationalist forces, as the French were extremely uneasy about reports of German activities in Spanish Morocco. Now that the Spanish Nationalist forces have allowed French officers to travel freely in the area, this concern can be alleviated. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Responsible sources announced today that German leader Hitler, taking advantage of French Ambassador to Germany Poncet's return to France, intends to have France invite German Economics Minister Schacht to Paris to negotiate political, economic, and financial issues. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>[Paris] French Ambassador to Germany Sepon returned from Berlin yesterday and paid a visit to Foreign Minister Delbos and Deputy Foreign Minister Weienot this morning for a lengthy conversation. According to responsible sources, Poncet did not bring with him an economic cooperation plan between France and Germany, as rumored by the outside world, but rather a preliminary plan to improve relations between France and Germany. As for the reports that German Economics Minister and President of the Deutsche Bank Dr. Schacht will come to Paris before Saturday, although there has been much commentary, it has not been finalized. Semi-official sources recently announced that Dr. Schacht's trip is to preside over the groundbreaking ceremony of the German pavilion at the 1937 International Exposition and has no other mission. In addition, the German government has not issued a communiqué on the mutual guarantees offered by German leader Hitler and Ambassador Poncet yesterday. Although officials and diplomatic circles in Berlin have praised it, the German press is still attacking the news about Spanish Morocco in the French newspapers this morning, and it is said that France is determined to conquer Spanish Morocco.

<h3>Italy's Attitude on the Ban on Volunteer Soldiers</h3>
<p>In Contact with the German Government; Will Be Somewhat Satisfactory</p>
<p>[Rome] According to responsible sources, the Italian government is taking an absolutely reserved attitude toward the British government's note to the Italian government advocating an immediate halt to the flow of volunteers to Spain, but it is not opposed to it. The Italian government will consult with the German government within days in the hope that the Italian and German governments will make the same reply. Both governments have now accepted this recommendation in principle. Public opinion believes that the Italian government's reserved attitude has a somewhat satisfactory background, as Rome is now gradually becoming aware of the danger of the Spanish situation escalating into an international dispute, which is becoming increasingly evident today. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>Legal Basis for British Ban on Volunteer Soldiers</h3>
<p>Leftists Oppose</p>
<p>[London] Yesterday, the British government announced that the 1870 law could also be applied to the issue of recruiting British volunteers in the current Spanish Civil War, but it would not have retroactive effect. Therefore, volunteers who have already gone to Spain, including 25 members of the Independent Labour Party, will not be affected. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>[London] British socialists have expressed extreme indignation at the British government's application of the 1870 law to ban British volunteers from joining the Spanish Civil War. Labour leader Attlee launched a sharp attack on the government in the House of Commons, criticizing the government's change of policy. Independent Labour Party Secretary Brockway issued a statement saying that the party is studying the legal basis of the government's plan. According to the initial legal opinion obtained here, it is doubtful whether the British government has the power to ban volunteers from going to Spain. Independent Labour Party leader Maxton has asked the Home Secretary about the issue. If a satisfactory answer is not received, he will request a debate in the House of Commons. In addition to the 25 people who left for Spain yesterday before the government plan took effect, the Independent Labour Party has another 100 people who must postpone their departure.

<h3>U.S. Neutrality Law Will Add a New Clause</h3>
<p>Prohibit People from Joining Foreign Armies; Violators Will Lose Citizenship</p>
<p>[Washington] According to reliable sources, the U.S. government will try to include a clause in the new neutrality law prohibiting U.S. citizens from joining foreign armies, and violators will lose their citizenship. In addition, according to the State Department, new passports issued since last August have the words "Not Valid in Spain" attached. This is not to prohibit U.S. citizens from going to Spain, but to indicate that they have no diplomatic protection. At the same time, the U.S. State Department has instructed the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Valencia to quickly find a way to move the 34 Americans who are still staying in the empty U.S. Embassy building in Madrid to a safe area. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Also Report on the Intrusion of German Forces into Morocco</h3>
<p>[London] Regarding the activities of Germans in Spanish Morocco, The Times recently published a report stating, "Various reports indicate that Melilla Port in Morocco has, in effect, become a German naval base. The airport and seaplane station in the port have been taken over by German technicians, and German Junkers and Dornier aircraft have arrived. Almost all Spanish personnel have left. In addition, an air base has been established in the Moroccan capital of Tetouan, and 18 German aircraft were shipped there on the 6th of this month. The total number of German aircraft there should be around 30. In addition, a seaplane shelter is being built near Melilla Port, in the Riel area, which can be used to avoid enemy bombing. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] Special reporters from The Times and the Morning Post, who were sent to Morocco to investigate rumors of German troops invading Spanish Morocco, both solemnly reported that there were no traces of German troops there. The Times reporter mentioned economic activities in Spanish Morocco, but did not regard them as extraordinary. The Morning Post reporter, after stating that there were no German troops, declared that the Soviet Union should be held responsible for spreading rumors, as its ambassador to Spain, Rosenberg, is directing the most intense propaganda campaign.

<h3>Spanish Rebels Intercept Another Russian Ship</h3>
<p>Third Ship in Two Weeks</p>
<p>Santander. Another Russian ship has been intercepted by the Spanish Nationalist forces, the third in two weeks. It is reported that the ship seized today was carrying food and was located near the coast of Santander. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Local newspapers recently reported that the Soviet merchant ship "Smidovich," loaded with food, was heading to Spain to supply the northern faction of the country and was intercepted by a Spanish Nationalist warship on the 8th of this month in the Bay of Biscay, southwest of France, and ordered to sail to its port. TASS also issued a manuscript attacking this "piratical behavior," saying, "The Spanish Nationalist forces' actions of inspecting and detaining Soviet ships must bear responsibility and cannot be avoided."

<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues Around Madrid</h3>
<p>City Residents Ordered to Evacuate</p>
<p>Madrid. The battle to capture Madrid continues today. The Nationalist forces' attacks on Aravaca and the University City area are said to have been repulsed and suffered heavy losses. The capital is redoubling its efforts to evacuate citizens. The city originally had a population of about one million, but has increased by 50% with refugees fleeing from the provinces. So far, 450,000 people have been transported to other areas under government jurisdiction. The available vehicles can transport 8,000 to 10,000 citizens per day. Jimenez, chairman of the Refugee Evacuation Committee, has assured the refugees that the police department will be responsible for taking care of the abandoned houses and furniture. Anyone who refuses to leave will have their food ration card revoked and will be brought to the People's Court for trial. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid. The local authorities are now actively handling the evacuation of residents. Jimenez, a member of the National Defense Committee and Chairman of the Evacuation Affairs Committee, told our reporter that there are two objectives of the evacuation: firstly, civilians can avoid the brunt of the fighting; and secondly, the defending troops are greatly inconvenienced by operating in densely populated areas. After the residents are evacuated, they will be able to act without restriction. "The capital has a population of one million people, plus residents from the provinces occupied by the rebels who have sought refuge in the capital, amounting to about 500,000 people. Our first duty is to evacuate these refugees first and settle them in the provinces loyal to the government. This has already been completed, and we are now focusing on the evacuation of the residents of this city. We hope to evacuate 250,000 residents from the capital. The plan is to use trucks to transport 8,000 to 10,000 people to the capital each day, then transfer them to trains to the rural areas. Residents leaving the capital are allowed to carry one package and one bag of clothes. The evacuated houses will be guarded by the police. In the future, only men aged 18 to 45 and their parents and wives will remain in the capital." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Four Fired from British Naval Shipyard</h3>
<p>Carrying Certain Documents</p>
<p>[London] Naval authorities discovered four employees at two naval dockyards carrying certain documents and took drastic action today, dismissing them and paying them their salaries, and sending them out of the shipyard within ten minutes by guards. One of them had served for a long time. According to Reuters's inquiry at the Plymouth Naval Headquarters, the Navy Department had ordered the dismissal of several shipyard employees, but did not explain the reason. Several warships had been secretly damaged, and confidential information had been leaked. The authorities sent police and detectives to secretly investigate more than 20 suspects. After several months, they determined that four people were actually involved, searched their toolboxes, and found some documents, hence today's action. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>New Developments in the U.S. Navy</h3>
<p>Strengthening of Rear Forces; Japan Attaches Great Importance</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The U.S. government began manufacturing two 35,000-ton battleships earlier this year and formulated a ten-year plan to invest US$200 million to build 54 new auxiliary ships. The Japanese Navy attaches great importance to this report from Washington and is paying attention to its future. This plan is neither the Vinson-Trammell Act naval construction program implemented in the past, nor other fixed plans, but an entirely new strategy. This year, the navy is entering an era without treaties, so the new direction of the U.S. Navy is fully expressed, and the plan is clearly an offensive against Japan. To ensure complete security, it aims to maintain its strong lineup. The plan focuses on the work of various ships and auxiliary units for transportation, rescue, and refueling, the so-called second line (rear), in order to enhance the combat power of the front-line combat units, and its completion will only be in a few years. The U.S. Navy is expanding its military power in this way, intending to seize hegemony in the Pacific and adhere to its strategy of attacking the Orient. Therefore, it is sparing no effort to make all preparations, which is generally considered extremely important. (Domei, 12th)</p>
<h3>French Aircraft Manufacturing Industry Nationalized</h3>

<p>[Paris] The government has decided to nationalize the entire aviation manufacturing industry and establish state-owned factories in various parts of the country to manufacture aircraft and engines, etc., in accordance with the law promulgated on August 11, 1936. These factories should be invested by the state, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total capital. Five such factories have already been established, and today Aviation Minister Goulet decided to add a sixth state-owned aircraft manufacturing plant in the Toulouse area to develop aircraft production and realize the planned aviation manufacturing program.

Later, the market price continued to fall due to profit-taking. At 1 PM, the price of March futures was 8 shillings and 9.625 pence, down 1.125 pence.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: Relatively firm today. At 1 PM, the price of April-June futures was 10.8125 pence, an increase of 0.1875 compared to yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>New York: The price of March futures rose by 6 points at the opening today to 22.50, sympathizing with the continued rise in the London market price. Subsequently, merchants felt apprehensive due to labor disputes, so they sold to cash in profits. At the time of the telegram, the price of March futures was 22.17, a decrease of 0.33 points from the opening price. The market prices of various items are listed below:</p>

<h3>Details of the Zhengzhou Commissioner's Office Cracking Down on Ronin Organizations</h3>
<p>Traitor Zhao Longtian Confesses to Colluding with Bandits in Riots; Three Ronin Arrested and Handed Over to the Japanese Consulate; Police Seize Much Evidence of Disturbing Our Country</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Telegram: On the 5th of this month, the First District Commissioner's Office of Zhengzhou cracked down on a secret Japanese ronin organization at No. 9 Tongshang Lane, arresting traitor Zhao Longtian and Japanese ronin Shiga, Yamaguchi, Tanaka, etc. After a personal interrogation by Commissioner Ruan, the traitor Zhao confessed to the conspiracy of ronin from a certain country to disturb our country, colluding with more than a thousand bandits led by Liu Guitang, who were hiding in the mountains of Yuxian County, plotting riots, destroying transportation, and robbing express trains. He also confessed to agreeing with more than a hundred ronin to set up opium-selling organizations in Zhengzhou, taking the opportunity to riot, etc. After the Commissioner's Office received the confession, considering the seriousness of the case, it immediately telegraphed the provincial government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions. Commissioner Ruan also went to Luoyang to report to Liu Zhi, the Pacification Director of Henan, Anhui, and Suiyuan. Subsequently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed instructions to negotiate locally. The evidence of the ronin's riots and secret documents seized have been sorted out and submitted to superiors for handling. The traitor Zhao Longtian and Zhang Mingqian, the chief of staff of the bandit Liu Guitang, who came to Zhengzhou recently and were arrested, are being interrogated at the Commissioner's Office. The three ronin have been extradited to the Japanese consulate for handling. After the case occurred, people from all walks of life in Zhengzhou, considering the seriousness of their conspiracy to harm our country, requested the government authorities to conduct serious negotiations. It is also heard that there will be some expression recently. As for the Japanese consulate, since the case occurred, it has also telegraphed to Tianjin and Shanghai for instructions. Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe sent Ambassadorial Secretary Hachiya Minoru from Shanghai to Zhengzhou to investigate. Upon arriving in Zhengzhou, Hachiya, along with the Japanese consulate staff members Owari and Harada, went to see Commissioner Ruan to inquire about the case. They were answered by Zhang Wanli, the Japanese secretary of the Commissioner's Office. Hachiya also went to Tongshang Lane with Mrs. Yamaguchi, the wife of the main culprit in the case, and Owari to conduct an on-site inspection. The Commissioner's Office also formally notified the Japanese consulate of the details of the case and evidence photos after sorting out the important secret documents. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Zhengzhou Commissioner's Office sent a letter to the Japanese Consulate in Zhengzhou, saying, "Regarding the case of cracking down on an organization that endangers the Republic of China at No. 9 Tongshang Lane in this port on the 5th of this month, in addition to Zhao Longtian being interrogated by this office in accordance with the law, the three Japanese Shiga, Yamaguchi, and Tanaka were taken back by your consulate on the 6th of this month and are being supervised and interrogated in accordance with the law. Now, I will supplement the facts of the case and all the evidence on the left. (A) Facts of the case: This office has repeatedly raised oral questions about what kind of organization No. 9 Tongshang Lane is. After your consul repeatedly stated that it was a cultural research organization and had no other purpose, this office was deeply convinced. Unexpectedly, around 9 PM on the 4th of this month, two people suddenly jumped out of the drying platform of the house and entered the backyard of the fire brigade set up by the Tongshang Lane Chamber of Commerce. The people in the fire brigade suspected that they were thieves and immediately reported them to the Public Security Bureau, which transferred them to the office. After interrogation by this office, one was Chinese Zhao Longtian, alias Yumen, and the other was Japanese Yamaguchi. Because Yamaguchi seemed to be slightly injured when jumping over the wall, and it was after 12 o'clock at night, they were ordered to rest temporarily. According to Zhao Longtian's confession, 'I am willing to confess everything I know to atone for my sins. I am also a graduate of the police academy. Because of my hobbies, I have financial difficulties. Introduced by a friend, I was hired by the Japanese Shiga to collude with bandits, destroy transportation, and lure ronin to Zhengzhou to sell opium, taking the opportunity to riot. The liaison point is at No. 9 Tongshang Lane. The leader is called Shiga, and there are two assistants, one named Tanaka and one named Yamaguchi. I joined in September last year. All the military secrets along the Daqing Line and the Yellow River were investigated by me under Shiga's orders. This time, I was arrested in Shaanxi while working under Shiga's orders. After being released, I went to Zhengzhou on the 2nd of this month and met with Shiga and reported everything. Shiga asked Yamaguchi and me to go to Tianjin to contact Zhang, the chief of staff of Liu Guitang, intending to call on more than a thousand of Liu Guitang's old subordinates, ‘now scattered in Yuxian County,’ to rise up, destroy the railway, and disrupt the rear. Shiga said it was not easy to go through the front door, so he told me to jump out of the drying platform. Unexpectedly, I was arrested because of this. I deserve to die for doing this,' etc. This is the situation of the first arrest and interrogation of Zhao Longtian. According to the above confession of Zhao Longtian, it can be determined that No. 9 Tongshang Lane is indeed an important organization intending to endanger our Republic of China, without a doubt. In order to eliminate the hidden dangers of the country and maintain local stability, this office had to deal with it urgently. Just as we were planning to notify your consul to send someone to jointly inspect, your consulate called to arrange a meeting, and we immediately replied, asking them to come quickly," "This was at 10:30 AM on the 5th." Ten minutes later, Owari, a staff member of your consulate, arrived at the office. He was informed in detail about the arrest of Zhao Longtian and Yamaguchi and the details of their confessions. He was asked to go to No. 9 Tongshang Lane immediately for a joint inspection. However, staff member Owari refused to go together because he had not obtained the permission of your consul. As a result, it was agreed that he would report back to the consulate and then go to the destination after obtaining permission. "This was at 11:10 AM." He said goodbye and returned to the consulate. This office immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to take the police directly to Tongshang Lane. They arrived at 11:20 AM, but the personnel sent by your consulate had not arrived. So they waited outside the house. After waiting for ten minutes, they heard a phone call in the house, "The news has been leaked." Knowing that the opportunity had been lost, they could no longer wait, so they rang the bell and called the door. After waiting for five minutes, there was no response. They saw smoke rising from the alley in the house, "Evidence is being destroyed." The inspectors pushed open the door and entered. Tanaka opened the second door and handed over the knife he was holding. They immediately entered the courtyard. Shiga was resisting with a gun upstairs. After careful persuasion, he handed over the pistol. At the same time, they extinguished a pile of documents that were being burned in the alley. They then inspected each room with Shiga, the owner of the house. (B) Evidence obtained during the inspection: The important evidence obtained in the house can be divided into the following items: 1. Plotting the independence of counties north of the Yellow River in Henan, using □□□ as officials of the autonomous region. 2. Colluding with bandits and militias, supplying them with weapons and ammunition to instigate riots. 3. Compiling and printing reactionary slogans, spreading rumors to incite the public. 4. Collecting Chinese military secret documents, maps, etc., to carry out espionage work. 5. Organizing special wireless classes to hinder or steal Chinese telecommunications. There are concrete witnesses and physical evidence for each of the above items. In addition to submitting a report to our superior authorities for verification and reserving all rights to speak, we will first select and photograph the major documents found, totaling 14 photos, and attach a translated version to be sent with this letter as a reference for your consul's interrogation. In addition, all evidence is being sorted out. If more is discovered in the future, it will continue to be sent. This is hereby stated. To Sasaki, the Japanese Consul in Zhengzhou. Total: 14 photos, one translated copy. Ruan Fanqi, Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the First District of Henan Province, January 9, 26th year of the Republic of China." (10th)</p>
<h3>The Calamity of the Xidan Commercial Market in Beiping</h3>
<p>Fire Discovered in the Old Market; 131 Businesses Burned Down; Cause Under Investigation</p>
<p>Beiping Telegram: The Xidan Paifang North Road East-West Commercial Market is the essence of the western city of the old capital, with a collection of domestic and foreign goods. The businesses are connected from beginning to end, divided into three parts: the Old Market, the New Market, and the South Market. The Old Market was built in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), while the New Market and the South Market were completed in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933). The land of the market belongs to a large number of shareholders. Yin Huanran, the head of the Second District of the Ping Municipality who was executed, owned several shares of the land. The New Commercial Market was built by Rongyi Real Estate Company, managed by Gao Yajie, with the 53rd Army Commander Wan Fulin as the major shareholder. A total of more than 470 houses were built, with construction costs reaching more than 400,000 yuan. Tianjin Huashang Yongxing Foreign Company holds 150,000 yuan in fire insurance. The Old Market was built by Cantonese merchant Huang Weiyong, with more than 400 houses and 100,000 yuan in fire insurance. Many businesses in the market also hold fire insurance.</p>
<p>Around 10 AM on the 10th, a fire suddenly broke out in the Old Market of the market. At that time, due to the strong north wind, the fire rose with the wind, the flames soared into the sky, and the smoke filled the air, illuminating the entire city with red light. Many merchants and shop assistants in the market were awakened from their dreams, rushing out with personal belongings and a small number of items, all piled up on the west side of the road. Some were unable to escape and were buried in the fire. When the fire first started, the fire brigade rushed to the scene after hearing the news. However, because the fire was coming from inside to outside, the doors had been sealed by the fire, so the firefighters could not put out the fire, resulting in an uncontrollable situation. The fire brigade changed its strategy, embracing the purpose of saving lives rather than saving property, and sprayed water on the unaffected houses from Huaili Hutong and the third floor of the Jincheng Store at the south gate of the Old Commercial Market to cut off the fire. However, the fire in the area that had already been ignited became more intense. Sparks fell into the courtyards of residents near Xidan. Around 3 PM, Ping Mayor Qin Dechun and Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Jiyan personally arrived at the scene to direct the fire fighting. Song Zheyuan also sent a battalion of soldiers from the 29th Army to set up posts around the fire to maintain order. Fortunately, there were no robberies. It was not until around 6 AM that the fire subsided slightly. The remaining fire was completely extinguished around 10 PM on the 10th. When the fire broke out in the Xidan Commercial Market, the nearby electric lights were completely extinguished, and the trams stopped running. The situation was restored to normal in the afternoon of the 10th. However, the magnificent commercial market has also become a field of rubble.</p>
<p>The cause of the fire is still under investigation. According to sources, there are two possible causes: ㊀ The electric wires near the back door of the New Market had a fire once a few days ago, or it was a recurrence. ㊁ There has been gambling in the market recently, and it is inevitable that there will be losses. The municipal authorities and insurance companies are paying close attention to these two points. As of the night of the 10th, a total of 131 shops in the second district have reported being affected by the disaster. The Old Commercial Market has been reduced to ashes, and most of the New Commercial Market has also been damaged. The loss is estimated to be over one million yuan, an unprecedented disaster in Ping City in more than ten years. The Tianjin British firm, Maclaine &amp; Co., a specialized agency for investigation and estimation of compensation for insurance companies, sent its Chinese manager Qu Daming to Ping on the 10th to handle everything. According to him, he will investigate the cause of the fire based on the reports of losses suffered by the merchants, which will take at least two or three months to complete. Rongyi Company has also telegraphed Wan Fulin and requested the Yongxing Insurance Company to send personnel to investigate and compensate. Huang Weiyong is also negotiating for compensation.</p>
<p>The authorities believe that the Xidan Commercial Market is the most prosperous place in the western city, and its destruction will have a great impact on the market. They are determined to do their best to promote its reconstruction and complete it in the short term. In the future, special attention will be paid to fire protection and sanitation. Zou Quansun, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, decided to convene an emergency meeting of all merchants on the 11th to discuss relief measures. It was decided to send personnel to investigate the disaster in detail first. After the Xidan Commercial Market was burned down, all the merchants in the Dong'an Market in the eastern city immediately conducted a general inspection of the electric wires in the entire market to prevent accidents. The electric lights and tram lines in the western city, and the respective companies, also sent personnel to inspect them once. (10th)</p>

<p>Hanjian Arrested at Shengzi Temple</p>
<p>The Shengzi Temple Police Station in the 7th district of this county found a suspicious person yesterday, brought him to the station for questioning, and found an ancient coin with the words "Safety and Stability" and four maps, and 9.7 yuan. The criminal confessed to the name of Zhang Hongzhi, 43 years old, from Tengxian County, Shandong Province, recently from Fengjing to Zhangyan to Shengzi Temple, begging for a living. Asked where the ancient coins and maps came from, he stared blankly and did not answer, obviously with some suspicion. The case was submitted to the county Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Gambling Arrest Leads to Death, Causing Uproar</p>
<p>Zhou Guangquan, a farmer from Zhouxiang Township in the 6th district of the county, was arrested by the police of the jurisdiction for gambling and sent to the county government for interrogation. However, during the transfer, he was beaten to death by police officer Zhou Xialin. After examination, he was sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for re-examination to clarify the truth. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 11th, more than 300 farmers from the township suddenly tied up police officer Zhou, intending to throw him into the river. The township mayor and others learned of this and rushed to persuade him earnestly, and struggled to rescue Zhou from danger. Unexpectedly, the farmers' remaining anger did not subside, and they destroyed all the police station's property. The county government learned of this and urgently telegraphed the district office to find out the instigator for legal action.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Exhibition of Wu Local Documents</p>
<p>The Suzhou Local Documents Exhibition, prepared by the Canglang Pavilion Jiangsu Provincial Library, has been actively underway for several months. The Appraisal Committee of the Association believes that Suzhou documents have always been known for their beauty and wealth, and holding an exhibition is an initiative. Therefore, it is determined to open on February 20.

The bureau has notified the public yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>County Magistrates from Various Provinces Come to Wuxi for Inspection</p>
<p>The industry and commerce in this county are developed, and the county administration and construction can also be a model for other counties. Therefore, there are often outsiders who come to Wuxi for inspection to learn from it. Commissioners and a large number of county magistrates from Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei and other provinces have visited Wuxi in succession. These include Luo Shou, the administrative inspector commissioner of the first district of Hunan, Major General of the Army, and the county magistrates of Liling County, He Li; Qing'an County, Zhang Yufei; Wu Gang County, Zhang Zhijue; and Chengbu County, Huang Shaoqiong. Qian Shaoqi, the magistrate of Chen County, Hunan, Li Shi, the magistrate of Zhaotong County, Yunnan, Liu Ganjun, the administrative inspector commissioner of the fifth district of Guizhou, and Li Daguang, the magistrate of Qingzhen County, came to Wuxi the day before yesterday. They were separately hosted by the county chief of the Long County and visited the Lixin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, the Industrial Machinery Factory, and the Qingfeng Yarn Factory.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob Guns and Resist Arrest</p>
<p>At about 2 AM on the morning of the 11th, the patrol team of Mingshan Town, East Suburb of Wuyi, set up sentry posts along Qingwu Road. Deputy Captain Ma Linsheng and others discovered a suspicious person and brought him back to the team to guard him. Unexpectedly, at about 3 AM, the criminal took advantage of the unpreparedness of the guard, broke through the door and fled. Chen Qizheng, the gate sentry, stepped forward to chase him, and the criminal robbed his gun and pushed Qizheng into the river. Qizheng did not let go, causing the criminal to fall into the river as well. The criminal was extremely fierce, and even strangled Qizheng's throat in the river. Squad leader Xu Liuguan and others rushed to the scene and rescued Qizheng from the river, and arrested the criminal. According to his confession, his name was Wang Zhongde, a native of Danyang, and he had committed theft in Zhenjiang. His other confessions were vague. He was immediately handed over to the First District Office and transferred to the county for handling.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Suppressing the Remnants of Bandits in the Jianghai Area</p>
<p>Recently, there have been remnants of bandits appearing in the coastal areas of northern Jiangsu and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, robbing cargo ships. The Third District Department of the Nantong Water Police Team has dispatched patrol teams and police ships such as Haiqing and Junhe to the ocean to carry out suppression and ensure the safety of merchants.</p>
<p>Yu Zhi Inspects Military Training</p>
<p>Yu Zhi, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial National Military Training Committee, inspected the military training situation in Mangtong on the 11th, reviewed the conscript team of the central school in the district assembly, and then went to Rugao and Haimen after Tonggong graduated.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Problems Arise with Silkworm Eggs</p>
<p>This spring, farmers in Jiaxing have raised spring silkworms with good harvests. Therefore, each breeding household has reserved silkworm eggs from the Silkworm Improvement Zone, with the number reaching more than 270,000 sheets. This number has already been approved by the Silkworm Silk Control Association. Now the Control Association only allows the distribution of 160,000 sheets. The Silkworm Improvement Zone, after learning of this news, believes that the number of silkworm eggs differs by more than 110,000 sheets, and the price of the eggs has been paid, which is very unexpected. However, problems are bound to arise when the seeds are distributed next spring. The Improvement Zone specially convened the persons in charge of egg reservation at the Construction Section of the County Government on the afternoon of the 11th. Section Chief Zhu Yisheng reported on the whole situation. After the attendees asked the county government to find a way to remedy the situation, they tried to argue with the Control Association to make up the number so as to avoid disputes when the seeds are distributed.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Electric Industry Raises Funds to Build Yanshi Hall</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Private Electric Industry Association Company believes that the late Chairman Yanshi made great contributions to the electric industry, and also made many achievements in national construction and social welfare. In order to commemorate his legacy, Ye Yangwu, Shen Sifang, Gao Shuan and others initiated the collection of funds to build the Yanshi Hall in the newly purchased association site at No. 154 Yueshengguan Road, Hangzhou, to record the memory and pass it on for a long time. The solicitation announcement is recorded as follows: Li Yanshi, a man of great learning and talent, did not admire fame and wealth. He deeply felt that the weakness of the country could not be saved without revitalizing industry. Therefore, he devoted his life to operating the electric business as a pioneer of industry. Furthermore, seeing that the electric business was governed separately, which hindered development, he advocated the organization of the National Private Electric Industry Association and the Zhejiang Provincial Branch, devoting his efforts and planning in detail. He took it upon himself to do anything that benefited the public. In the end, he forgot himself for the sake of the public, and his mind and body were exhausted. He suddenly died of illness in Shanghai in the autumn of last year. The bad news spread, and we deeply mourned. Heaven gave him talent, so why be stingy with his years, causing his talent to be buried forever, unable to accomplish his unfinished ambitions. It is not only a loss to our electric industry, but also a misfortune to the country and society. Now, in order to commemorate his legacy, we have gathered comrades to contribute our efforts to raise funds to build a memorial hall in the newly purchased association site of the Zhejiang Electric Industry Association in Hangzhou to comfort his soul and perpetuate it. However, a thousand gold skins cannot be obtained from one fox armpit. Although it was initiated by colleagues, the effectiveness is limited and there is no way to increase the glory. Tracing back to Li's life, there is no shortage of relatives and friends, and it is expected that they will be happy to help and see its completion early. On the day of completion, a monument will be erected to inscribe the names and record the grand occasion. The gift money is divided into four categories: medium (eight yuan), positive (six yuan), harmonious (four yuan), and peaceful (two yuan), to symbolize Li's character. If you are willing to donate more money, it will be deeply engraved. I hope you will not abandon me and join us in this endeavor.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>The Decline of the Changhuai Shipping Industry</p>
<p>Last year, the water level of the Changhuai River dropped, with some shallow areas having only a little over a foot of water. This was unprecedented in more than a decade. On December 15th, there was heavy rain in northern Anhui for two days and nights. By the 20th, the water level of the Huai River suddenly increased by more than two feet, and the small regular passenger boats running between Bengbu and Zhengyangguan, which had been suspended for a long time, resumed navigation. Passengers and cargo could travel smoothly without hindrance. Unexpectedly, in the past few days, the water volume has dropped again by one foot. Currently, the Bengbu Changhuai Shipping Industry Association is facing difficulties because the regular service between Bengbu and Zhengyangguan can only reach Tianjia'an. Between Tianjia'an and Zhengyangguan, manual towing is required, which used to take one day and night, but now takes seven or eight days. Most passengers choose to transfer to buses from Tianjia'an to Zhengyangguan for convenience. Therefore, the regular service can only operate once every other day, mainly transporting goods. The freight costs are barely covering expenses, but to maintain water transportation, it cannot be interrupted, so they have to continue operating with heavy losses. The business has declined sharply, and they are suffering significant losses. Fortunately, with the winter defenses in place, the route between Bengbu and Zhengyangguan is still peaceful, and the boats can pass safely.</p>
<h3>Haizhou</h3>
<p>Poor Cargo Transportation at Lianyungang</p>
<p>Cargo transportation at Lianyungang is usually very prosperous during the autumn and winter seasons, leading to increased work for laborers and flourishing commercial activities. Last year, due to the Xi'an Incident, from the beginning of November to January of this year, despite being the peak cargo season, the docks were deserted, with few ships docking and little truck traffic. The city's industry and commerce gradually declined imperceptibly. Compared with previous years, the situation was as different as one compared to ten. The business community hopes that the traffic on the western section of the Longhai Railway will be restored as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Exciting Xiqing Basketball Game: Jinan Faces Xintong for the Second Time</h3>
<p>Xin Team vs. Mailingjia at 9 PM, Game Starts at 8 PM</p>
<p>Last night's Xiqing basketball game in the Ordinary Group featured Tongwen against Yuezhong. Tongwen, with four wins and no losses, was tied with Moore at the top. In last night's game against Yuezhong, Tongwen initially took a lead of sixteen to seven, showing great momentum. However, Yuezhong actively caught up, and in one breath, tied the score at thirty-three. In the last half minute, Yuezhong scored under the basket, using this precious point to reverse the defeat and win thirty-five to thirty-three, bringing much relief to the Chinese people. From now on, Yuezhong, Tongwen, and Sooker are tied with four wins and one loss, while Moore reaps the benefits, with very high hopes for the future. The second game was originally Tongji against Nanjing in the University Group, but it was temporarily changed to Nanjing against Fudan. However, Nanjing did not show up due to unresolved resentment from the previous night, giving up the game, and Fudan won without effort. Tonight's two games are among the most exciting scenes in the finale of Xiqing basketball. Jinan will play Xintong first at eight o'clock. Jinan's strength has been exceptionally strong recently. Xintong, after consecutive defeats in the capital, should be able to avenge the humiliating defeat by three points in the previous round (twenty-six to twenty-nine). Although the championship is out of reach, they can still bring joy to the Chinese people. At nine o'clock, the Xin team will play Mailingjia. The Xin team was unhappy and left the previous game due to the referee's unfairness. Tonight, the Xin team should be more prepared. If they can defeat Mailing, then the runner-up position will be decided in the game between Jinan and Mailing this Saturday. If Xintong loses to Mailing next Monday, there is a possibility of a three-way battle for the championship.</p>

Fortunately, Mr. Zeng Zhi of the Chinese Athletic Referees Association in this city has offered to volunteer, which has been resolved. This demonstrates the referees' enthusiasm for supporting sports. The association's current league committee has appointed Mr. Le Xiurong as chairman, and Messrs.

<h3>Ministry of Education Takes Over Northeastern University</h3>
<p>Appoints Zang Qifang as Acting President</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Northeastern University was originally a provincial university. After the September 18th Incident, it moved from Shenyang to Beiping, with a total of over 700 students. Zhang Xueliang, the president of the university, had planned to move the entire university to Xi'an for expansion. The construction of the new campus in Shaanxi has been completed, and the College of Engineering had already moved there during the summer vacation of the year before last. The College of Liberal Arts and the preparatory classes were also scheduled to move west during this winter vacation. However, after the Xi'an Incident, the alumni association of Dongda and Northeastern people in Beiping petitioned the Ministry of Education to take it over as a national university and appoint another president. Recently, the Ministry of Education has approved the Executive Yuan's takeover as a national university and appointed the current Jiangsu Wuxi Administrative Commissioner Zang Qifang as acting president. Mr. Zang arrived in Beiping from Beijing on the 9th of this month after being ordered to take over the university.</p>
<p>(Beiping, December 12th) Zang Qifang arrived in Beiping on the 11th to take over Northeastern University and visited Song Zheyuan and others to discuss everything.

(Central News Agency, December 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping, December 12th) The Ministry of Education will change Northeastern University to a national university and has sent Zang Qifang to Beiping to take over. Zang arrived in Beiping and visited Song, Qin, and other relevant parties. The negotiations resulted in a satisfactory outcome. The Hebei-Chahar authorities hope that Zang will strive for peace in taking over Dongda. Zang expressed to people that his purpose in coming to Beiping to take over Dongda is purely the central government's intention to reorganize Dongda, and that Dongda is inseparable from the country and must be consistent with the central government's intentions. All students should be united.</p>

<h3>Mining and Metallurgical Engineering Society</h3>
<p>Lu Zhixue and Zheng Weisan Lecture</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Mining and Metallurgical Engineering Society held a New Year's lecture and dinner party at the Wuzhou Building on the 6th floor the day before yesterday. Chairman Lu Zhixue gave a speech, saying, "At this time when the Chinese nation is relying on its own efforts for regeneration, I wish that members of this association will be able to rely on their own efforts in the mining and metallurgical industries, seek proper development, and enable the national and social construction work to obtain self-sufficient resources. This is also the responsibility that we mining and metallurgical colleagues should fulfill." Tonight, members Zheng Weisan and Zhang Lianke will lecture on the past history and recent situation of the Kailuan Coal Mine and the Shanghai Steel Plant. Mining and metallurgical colleagues all want to listen. We all know that the coal and iron industry is the foundation of a country. Whether a country's coal and iron industry is developed can be used to observe the strength of a country. Forty years ago, Japan's coal and iron industry was not as developed as ours. In 1904, when I went to study in Japan, Japan's pig iron production was the same as ours, no more than 20,000 to 30,000 tons per year. By 1912, our country's new ironmaking method produced over 10,000 tons per year, and Japan could produce 200,000 tons, which was more than double. By 1922, our country's pig iron production was about 150,000 tons, and Japan had increased to 630,000 tons. By 1926, our country's pig iron production had completely stopped, and Japan had increased to 930,000 tons. By 1935, our country only had one iron-smelting furnace at the Liuhegou Coal and Iron Company in Hankou, which could produce 100 tons of pig iron per day, but it was open and closed intermittently, and could only produce more than 30,000 tons per year. Japan had increased to over 2 million tons of pig iron per year. In addition, there are two iron plants operated by Japan in South Manchuria, one in Benxihu and one in Anshan Station, which can produce more than 600,000 tons of pig iron per year. Therefore, Japan's national industry is becoming more and more developed, and the people are becoming richer and stronger. The rich resources of the South Manchuria iron ore are originally our resources, but now they are occupied by Japan, providing raw materials for others to make iron. Thinking about it, how can we not be heartbroken? Now, for example, the Shanghai Steel Plant and the Heye Steel Plant sometimes have to purchase raw materials from foreign countries for steelmaking, while our country's iron ore in the Yangtze River area is exported to Japan in large quantities every year. It is heard that the amount of iron ore exported to Japan in recent years is no less than one million tons, which is a shame for our country and a shame for our mining and metallurgical colleagues. To wash away this shame, we must rely on the cooperation of our mining and metallurgical colleagues and the government to work hard to develop the mining and metallurgical industry and strive for self-sufficiency in steel. Now, let us first invite Mr. Zheng Weisan to lecture on the situation of the Kailuan Coal Mine." Mr. Zheng said that the Tangshan, Linxi, Zhaogezhuang, and Tangjiazhuang four mines of the Kailuan Mining Bureau currently produce 12,000 tons per day, with a total annual output of 6 million tons. The highest record was 6.5 million tons. In recent years, the annual output has been 4 million tons, which is sufficient to meet social needs. In order to reduce costs, the bureau closed the Majiagou Mine a year ago. Kailuan coal and coke have long been famous at home and abroad. Manufacturers along the coast and inland use it in large quantities. In Shanghai in recent years, annual sales have been about 3 million tons, and Kailuan coal ranks first, accounting for one-third. In 1926, Kailuan coal sales in Shanghai were 1.2 million tons. Recently, the Kailuan authorities plan to select and wash coal to improve it. The chairman then introduced Mr. Yi Caijun, the former manager of the Muling Coal Mine, to lecture on the history of the Muling Coal Mine. The Muling Coal Mine Company was jointly established by the Jilin Provincial Government and a Russian named Xie Jisi in 1924. Geological surveys were conducted for four years (1922-1925), led by the famous geologist Mr. Yanata. The mine is located at 45 degrees 23 minutes north latitude and 121 degrees 30 minutes east longitude, north of the Middle East Railway, and in the middle and lower reaches of the Muling River. The mine branch road is 85 kilometers long. The total reserves of the mine are estimated to be 14,459,000 tons. This is the result of calculations based on 169 drill holes, 275 well pits, 14 trenches, 13 horizontal tunnels, and 650 small drill holes. From 1927 to 1932, the annual output was 300,000 tons. Then, Mr. Zhang Lianke, the manager of the Shanghai Steel Plant, lectured on electric steel smelting. According to him, humans have used iron for 5,000 years, but steel for only 200 years. As for electric steelmaking, it has only been 50 years. The mass production of steel in electric furnaces is the success of the 20th century. Ten years ago, there were only two or three electric furnaces in Japan, but now there are over a hundred, the largest being 15 tons, and the common ones being two or three tons. The world's largest electric furnace is 40 tons. The cost of electric steel smelting in Japan is 54 yuan per ton, which is slightly lower than the German production price. The reason is due to the development of hydroelectric power. If our country wants to obtain low costs, we must develop cheap electricity. Finally, the members had dinner, hosted by Messrs. Wang Ertao, Yang Zhuo, and Zhang Lianke.</p>

<h3>Wang Yukai's Broadcasted Speech on Civic Training Issues (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Next, let's talk about Japan. Japanese citizens also have several unique characteristics:</p>
<p>First, the spirit of sacrificing for the country—Japanese patriotism is arguably second to none in the East. Its national education aims can be said to be entirely nationalistic. Japanese university students have the responsibility of instilling national spirit into the masses. Therefore, even young children and maids know how to sacrifice for the country. During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan was able to overwhelm Imperial Russia, which cannot but be attributed to the efforts of Japanese primary school teachers.</p>
<p>Second, simplicity and hard work—The simplicity of Japanese life is fully expressed in terms of clothing, food, and housing. Their houses are made of wooden boards and paper shells. Ordinary people use a room as a reception room during the day, and at night they take out bedding from the closet and spread it on the floor as a bedroom, which can be said to be very simple. In terms of eating, the Japanese are also very simple. Ordinary people eat nothing more than a bowl of cold rice and a few pieces of salted radish. When going out to work or students going to school, they only pack these things in a small wooden box called "bento," put it in the sleeve of their coat, pour some boiled water on it when it's time to eat, and that's it. If a guest comes today, they first kneel down and place a small square table in the middle of the room to enjoy tea for a while, which is their way of entertaining guests. They also strive to avoid luxury in their clothing. The clothes they wear are "kimonos," which are wide-sleeved and made of sturdy materials, but are very cheap. Most of the shoes they wear on their feet are wooden clogs that are not worth much, and very few people wear leather shoes. However, when they work, they can truly endure hardship and are tireless. Therefore, since the Meiji Restoration, whether in domestic industry, military affairs, politics, medicine, or other applied sciences, everything has been thriving and progressing.</p>
<p>Third, striving for innovation—Japan is a newly advanced country. Most of their culture came from China. Whether it is the standard of morality or academic propositions, they all imitate China. After the Meiji Restoration, they imitated the West. All customs, culture, and academics followed Europe and America. The translation industry is extremely developed. Returned students regard translation work as a specialized profession. New books published in Western countries will definitely have translated versions in Japan in less than half a year. At present, not only can all kinds of undertakings follow in the footsteps of Europe and America, but they also have a tendency to surpass them. Let's not discuss the distant past for the time being. We only need to look at the warships, airplanes, and various new weapons stationed in our country to prove the greatness of their creative ability. The above is a general overview of the national characteristics of the United States and Japan. There are many things that we can refer to, but the actual situation in our country may not be exactly the same as theirs. Now, based on my humble opinion, I will list the following points and add some explanations as goals for civic training in our country:</p>
<p>㊀ Popularizing literacy education—There are too many illiterate people in China. Apart from quickly popularizing literacy education, there is really no way to immediately make them have patriotic emotions and national salvation concepts. Shanghai once had a movement to promote literacy education. I think it should be extended to the countryside now to achieve the popularization of literacy education. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Sanpin Suspends New Transactions</p>
<p>Only Closing Deals This Week. Near-Month Yarn Reached 300 Yuan Yesterday.</p>
<p>Osaka, 12th: Futures yarn in Sanpin rose by 6.5 to 10 yuan, with the near month at 300 yuan and the far month at 283 yuan. Futures cotton rose by 1.25 yuan to fall by 0.1 yuan, with the near month at 76.3 yuan and the far month at 81.45 yuan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Osaka: The Sanpin Exchange held a meeting of brokers this afternoon and decided to suspend new transactions in yarn, cotton, and rayon this week. Trading will resume as usual on Tuesday, but only to close deals.</p>
<p>Sanpin Soars, Market Suspends; Yarn Market Weakens Downstream</p>
<p>Production Increases Significantly; Industry Tends to Sell Off; Year-End Settlement Approaching; Transactions Inevitably Decrease</p>
<p>The yarn market has weakened, and the momentum has turned calm, mainly because the end of the lunar year is approaching. According to commercial practice, there is a general settlement of accounts. Therefore, the sales of current yarn are particularly sluggish. Yarn mills selling short-term yarn are particularly numerous. Industry insiders say that at present, all factories are fully operational, rushing to manufacture, and the production volume has increased significantly compared to before, so they tend to sell off. However, the Osaka Sanpin rose sharply. Afternoon telegrams from Sanpin said that Sanpin soared and the market was suspended in the afternoon. Another message said that Sanpin yarn can only be used to close deals and cannot be used to make new deals until the end of this Saturday.</p>
<p>Lack of New Purchases of Marked Yarn</p>
<p>The market for marked yarn opened lower for all months. Good quality yarn closed higher in the afternoon. It was rumored that Sanpin yarn broke through 300 yuan, closing at the highest price. The news this morning was less favorable. Sanpin suspended new transactions and only closed deals, which further stabilized people's minds. Telegrams from Sanpin showed that the current month only rose by 2 yuan, and the far month rose by 3-4 yuan. At the same time, the transaction of spot yarn in this port was particularly depressed, so new buyers were less interested. By the close, Sanpin jumped again this month, reaching 300 yuan. The forward price also rose by 3, 4, and 5 yuan. As a result, the prices for all months rose by 6.5 to 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The marked yarn closed slightly higher, but the prices for all months fell by 6, 7, and 8 jiao to 1.3 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market was very weak when it opened in the afternoon, and the range of price fluctuations was very narrow. Telegrams from Sanpin said that Sanpin soared and the market was suspended in the afternoon, and there were even fewer transactions in the market. Spot yarn business was sluggish. As a result, the price for this month rose by 5 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the forward price fell by 2, 5, and 9 jiao. It was found that Yugang sold 1,000 bales, Renfeng 650 bales, Hexing 1,000 bales, Senkang 1,000 bales, Dachangcheng 2,600 bales, Changfeng 1,250 bales, Xiesheng 2,200 bales, Xincheng 1,600 bales, and Taichang 850 bales. Wang Taixing bought 1,300 bales, Tongji 1,900 bales, Hengyi 800 bales, Yuda 1,350 bales, Mingde 800 bales, Shengyuan 1,350 bales, Yongda 1,350 bales, and Yuan Yi 1,100 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Become Increasingly Slack</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are flat. It was found that the total number of futures and spot yarn bought by various gangs throughout the day was 567 bales, and the selling price fell by 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of various gangs are listed below.</p>
<p>Speculation Abounds in Going Long; Cotton Prices Ultimately Suppressed by Inventory</p>
<p>The cotton market has turned downward due to the bleak trend of English cotton and the lack of demand from factories, so people's minds are calm. However, some speculative minds are going long due to the strong rise in Indian cotton and the high price of Sanpin cotton. However, the inventory of cotton in Shanghai has not decreased, and the yarn market is mediocre.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Falls Back by Four Jiao</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened lower in the morning because it followed the rumors of Sanpin cotton rising to a high closing price the previous day. This morning, US cotton fell slightly, Indian cotton was stronger, and fine cotton was flat. Although the price of Osaka Sanpin cotton rose by 2.6 yuan this month, the far month fell by 7, 8 jiao to 1.3 yuan. People's minds were even more frustrated, and the prices for all months fell by 2 and 3 jiao. After the second session, it was still mediocre. By the close, it was heard that Sanpin cotton fell slightly in the near term, and the far term rose by 2 yuan, and the market situation was slightly higher. As a result, the prices for all months fell by half a jiao to one jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market was still strong when it opened in the afternoon. After the third session, it turned downward, and the transactions in the market were very light. As a result, the prices for all months fell by half a jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Hengyi sold 1,300 dan, Gengfeng 1,100 dan, Changji 1,300 dan, Dachangcheng 1,200 dan, Changfeng 1,300 dan, Runkang 1,400 dan, Xiesheng 1,200 dan, Tonghe 1,800 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,500 dan, Yikang 1,900 dan, Xinchang 1,900 dan, and Changhe 1,400 dan. Jifeng bought 1,500 dan, Yuda 3,300 dan, Changyu 1,300 dan, Wang Taixing 1,400 dan, Yuan Yi 1,300 dan, and Hengchang 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption is Ordinary</p>
<p>Cotton mills are unable to operate smoothly. The sources are 1,100 bales of Yao cotton and 1,386 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Amidst Sanpin's Wild Surge, Japanese Yarn Exports are Active</p>
<p>Recently, the price of cotton yarn in Osaka Sanpin has been soaring step by step. The price for January has reached 300 yuan. It is even cheaper to calculate the export of Shanghai cotton yarn. Therefore, buyers in Southeast Asia are purchasing from Japanese trading firms in this port, with orders amounting to about 1,000 bales. At the same time, Japan is also frequently becoming a buyer of 40-count yarn from Japanese trading firms in this port, and there is a trend of exporting to Japan since 1934.</p>
<p>It has been found that the market for cotton yarn in Osaka Sanpin has continued to rise recently. After the announcement of the strengthened exchange control law at the end of last week, prices have risen even higher. The Sanpin cotton market has become even more intense due to concerns about delivery, with the far-month July rising to 82 yuan. It is said that there is also a scarcity of Indian cotton yarn, so buyers in Southeast Asia are particularly eager and are placing orders everywhere. Yesterday, the contracted brands were 20-count Fenghua and Lanfeng Japanese yarn, totaling 500 bales, with delivery dates in February, March, and April.</p>
<p>No Solution Yet for Loaned Cotton; American Cotton Bullish Investors Liquidating; Concerns of British Cotton and Silk Merchants About Japanese-Austrian Trade Agreement; Demanding Government Use Contracting Policy to Secure Guarantee</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with mixed and sluggish conditions, with prices for all months falling by 7 points to rising by 1 point. Bullish investors in January and March were liquidating and moving to the far month. At the same time, seeing that there was no definite solution for borrowed cotton, old bullish investors were also liquidating, fearing that they would be affected, leading to a softer market. However, industry insiders were actively buying when prices fell, and the domestic textile industry's consumption was very smooth. Unfortunately, there was a great lack of new accounts. The closing price showed a fall of 3 points for spot goods and a fall of 3 to 5 points for futures. The consumption of domestic yarn and woven goods is still good, but there is a lack of new interest. English cotton spot goods rose by 2 points, and futures rose by 4 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to the strong rise in Japanese yarn, and purchases by mainland and exporters, but then fell back due to sales by cotton farmers and speculators. Finally, speculators re-entered, and prices rose again. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 3.75 to 5 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.5 to 3 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 11th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the 12th is that Bailuoxi is 230.5 rupees, Aomula is 206.75 rupees, and Pingguoer is 182.5 rupees, all unchanged.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: The Manchester Chamber of Commerce held a board meeting today to express concern about the impact of the Japanese-Austrian trade agreement on the British cotton and rayon industries. A formal statement was issued after the meeting, meaning that the British government should cooperate more effectively with Austria so that Austria can maintain its smooth terms of trade with Lancashire's cloth export industry. The board meeting decided to petition Prime Minister Baldwin, requesting the cabinet to adopt a contracting policy and consult with various countries to fully guarantee that the stability of the British cotton and rayon market will be an absolute condition for any country to enter into a good trade agreement with Britain.</p>
<p>Statistics on Raw Cotton Purchased by Yarn Factories Last Week</p>
<p>The amount of raw cotton purchased by the Japanese factories of Shanghai Maihua last week was 7,741 bales, and the amount purchased by the Chinese and English factories was 14,367 bales, totaling 22,108 bales. The names and quantities of raw cotton purchased by Chinese and foreign factories are recorded separately below (unit: bale):</p>
<p>Volume of Cotton Exported from Rangoon Last Week</p>
<p>Mumbai, 11th: The total amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 1,902 tons, of which 1,098 tons were to Kobe, 447 tons to Osaka, 89 tons to Yokohama, 179 tons to Dalian, and 89 tons to Liverpool.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth is Particularly Strong in Japanese Factory Boards</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the surge in the Osaka yarn market, the market for imported Japanese piece goods such as bleached cloth and grey cloth was the best. The original price of yarn poplin grey cloth was 2 jiao per yard, but it has now risen to 2 jiao and 4 and a half fen. The boards of various cloth factories produced by various Japanese factories in Shanghai are also strong, but the market demand is not high, and business on all routes is scattered, so it is difficult to stir people's hearts. Eastern goods such as fine twill and fine cloth still need to be allocated with warehouse receipts, and the allocation of fine twill is relatively scarce. The market board for fine cloth and fine twill has risen slightly (per piece) by 2 and a half fen. Northern, inland, and dyeing factories all purchased more than 300 pieces of spot goods. Local factories sold 4 to 500 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, and coarse cloth to dyeing factories, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and other gangs for spot goods and goods for this month. The Tianjin gang on the northern route slightly loaded coarse cloth and coarse twill, and the Eastern gang purchased more than 100 boxes of Serge, flannel, printed straight tribute, and checkered tribute. The selling boards for all goods were stable, and occasionally the price was lowered (per piece) by a few fen to one jiao.</p>

<p>Spot Numbers Constantly Sold; Standard Gold Loses Its Stability; Result Returns to Small Eight Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market initially rose in the morning because the overseas silver market rose for both Sterling and US dollars, and the forward silver price in Montreux also rose by 5 hao to 7 li.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Switching Slightly Competitive; Unified Bonds Near Weak and Far Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange tended to be sluggish, and transactions were still idle and lifeless. The market sentiment was increasingly weak, and both long and short sides were still holding on. There were only more switching transactions on the table, but because of the slight competition, the market price was weak and then firm, which was quite confused, and the dull atmosphere has not yet unfolded. Yesterday morning, the forward price of Type E was still good for one jiao, but after Type D, there were quite a few retail sales, and the market prices were all down by one jiao to two and a half jiao. In the second session, the trend became more and more depressed, and the sales of numbers 10, 11, 15 and 35 can be called enthusiastic. Type E and Type B all fell by one jiao to three jiao, and the forward price of Type C and Type A rose by five fen. The afternoon market opened with a firmer trend. Numbers 32 and 43 absorbed quite a lot, and numbers 10 and 11 were sold less. Except for the slightly weaker five fen for Type A next month, the rest all rose by five fen to two jiao. The closing was very enthusiastic for switching, but because they were all retail sales in and out, it was quite chaotic, and the market price gradually showed a trend of near weakness and far strength. The result for the whole day was a uniform decrease of five fen to three jiao, and Type C was uniquely good for one and a half jiao next month. The total number of transactions was 3.98 million yuan. The comparison of its rise and fall is listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Dutch Sugar Prices Rise for the Second Time; Local Sugar Market Sees Growing Speculation</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Surabaya on the first of the month stated that the Dutch East Indies Sugar Company announced today an increase of 1.9 Dutch cents in the export price of sugar. The export price was previously raised by 1 cent on January 5th, making this the second price increase this year.</p>
<p>In the local sugar market, the further rise in Dutch prices has spurred even greater speculation. The guild's assessment puts No. 24 raw sugar at 22.5 yuan, transit goods at 7.3 yuan, a sudden increase of 3 jiao. After leaving the warehouse, the price is 22.8 yuan, No. 4 East White at 22.6 yuan, transit goods at 7.7 yuan, No. 8 at 22.4 yuan, transit goods at 7.4 yuan, and YRO at 22.1 yuan, transit goods at 7 yuan, all rising by 3-4 jiao. The local factory's fine white sugar also rose by 2 jiao alongside the raw sugar, such as Dahua Golden Heart No. 1 at 21.2 yuan, Nos. 3, 4, and 5 at a discount of 2 jiao per grade. The Chaozhou merchants are offering Huanggang Qing at 14.23 yuan, and Ban Nan Qing at 13.67 yuan, totaling over 300 packages. Xinghua sugar is offered at over 1,000 packages, priced as follows: Da Gong Fen from 19.9 yuan to 20 yuan, Xiao Gong Fen at 18.5 yuan, Shang Gong Jiao at 17.3 yuan, Gong Jiao from 16.8 yuan to 17 yuan, and Ming Jing Chi from 16.3 yuan to 16.5 yuan. Yesterday, more than 1,400 packages of Zhang Diao Qing arrived via the Haili and Guangzhou shipping lines.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>As the Settlement Period Approaches, Futures Wheat Transactions Are Mostly Being Closed Out</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, according to a Reuters dispatch from Chicago on the 11th, saw wheat prices fluctuating with some selling by bulls and buying by retail investors. Prices fell by 2.5 to 8.75. After the opening in the morning, the market for various months showed an initial flatness followed by stability, with little difference from the previous day. Subsequently, the flour market weakened and then recovered, slightly improving sentiment. By the afternoon opening, trading in January was very thin, and prices were also flat and weak. Because factories are currently very slow to process spot wheat, the near-term standard wheat price is difficult to sustain. Prices for February and beyond, however, rose by 2-3 fen due to the continued strength of the flour market. However, with the settlement date approaching, most transactions are being closed out, so any unexpected rally will have to wait until after the settlement. The spot wheat market has stagnated, as factories are very quiet in their purchasing and show no intention of stocking up, with only 3,500 packages changing hands at a price that was 3-4 fen lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Bulls in the Flour Futures Market Feel Slightly Stronger</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, showed an initial weakening followed by a strengthening trend. With quotations for foreign wheat falling in Chicago by 8 fen to 2 jiao, in Canada by 4 fen, and in Liverpool by nearly one penny, sentiment was weak after the opening. The opening price for this month was 4.12 yuan, and for February it was also slightly lower by 1.5 fen. In March and April, there was no change in the market as outside investors continued to buy. After the second round of trading, both sides were making few transactions, but the factories were waiting and not selling, and the bulls seemed to feel stronger, so the market held up. By the afternoon opening, the price for this month rose due to short covering, and major players were not selling. The price for February also rose by 2-3 fen compared to the morning due to very few sales. March and April only rose by about 1 fen. Those in the market ultimately believe that the market value is too high and consumption is secretly decreasing. Unless there are special events, there will be no excessive action.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants and Stockpilers Are Both Procuring</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of more than 40 shipments arrived from various sources, totaling 8,400-8,500 shi. Among them, more than 20 shipments were of Bo Dao rice. Sales in this street market were normal, and purchases were similar to before. It is estimated that shipments of Bo Dao rice from Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, and other sources totaled more than 2,000 packages, so the Bo Dao rice market remains stable, and the future market situation will only fluctuate. Hou Geng rice rebounded by 5 fen after falling significantly, while Du Yang Jian rice showed no change, and Yin Bian Yuan rice also lacked momentum.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 26-27 shipments arrived from various sources along the river. The sale of white japonica rice in the market was normal, and stockpiling continued, with prices closely tied to the market, excluding brokerage fees. Early rice followed the rise, increasing by 1.3-4 fen. The sale of Bo Dao rice was not smooth, and prices were high by several fen. The purchase of Yang Du Jian rice continued, and prices also rose sharply by 6-7 fen. Sales of Bai Yuan rice became more active, and prices increased by about 1 jiao. Yin Yuan rice was scarce, and sales were brisk, with prices increasing beyond brokerage fees. The price of Ke Jian rice also showed a tight trend.</p>
<p>(Customer Rice) Demand Remains Strong, with Daily Arrivals of Tens of Thousands of Packages Over the Past Two Days; Existing Stocks Are Abundant, Stockpiles Are Sufficient, and More Shipments Are on the Way. Sales in Producing Areas Have Been Weak Recently, and Prices Are Flat, with Gradual Shipments to Shanghai. Sellers Plan to Sell Off Stocks at Reduced Prices Due to the Approaching New Year. Therefore, Although Demand for Customer Rice Was Strong Yesterday, It Was Ultimately Suppressed by Sales Efforts by Merchants and Sellers, and Prices Fell Slightly by 3-5 Fen. Transaction Volume Exceeded 20,000 Packages, with Guangdong Shipments Accounting for More Than Half. Changjie Transactions Were Also Active, While Shantou Transactions Were Few. Over 10,000 Packages of Jiangxi Rice, 6,000 Packages of Han Rough Rice, 1,000 Packages of Hunan Rice, and 2,000 Packages of Wen-Yong Rice Were Offered Throughout the Day.</p>
<p>Sales of Yellow Soybeans Surge; Foreign Sesame Opens at 15 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, sales of yellow soybeans surged due to the rebound in Dalian. The rise in Dalian boosted the local market. In the morning, after Dalian reported an increase, sentiment in the local market was still stable, and oil mills took the opportunity to purchase, so the market was active. In the afternoon, after Dalian continued to rise by 1 jiao, the atmosphere in the market immediately became tense. Holders raised their asking prices, and as a result, prices rose by 5-6 fen compared to the previous market. Sales included 16 carloads of Bengbu soybeans, more than 2,600 packages of Tancheng soybeans, 1 carload of Yingzhou soybeans, 1 carload of Linhuai soybeans, 16 carloads of Sipingjie soybeans, over 3,000 packages of Zuo Kai Zha soybeans, 250 packages of Sha yellow soybeans, 157 packages of Gou soybeans, and 120 packages of Chi soybeans. The market for foreign sesame has opened at 15 yuan, with 550 tons being traded before and after. It is reported that British and Japanese merchants are handling the transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Overseas Silk Prices Soar; Negotiations on Chinese Silk Still Not Close; Fortunately, Domestic Sales Provide Some Relief</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk markets overseas, including Japan, the US, and France, all saw rising prices. The price of New York standard silk for the near-term March delivery was $2.07, and for the longer-term July delivery, it was $2.06. Yokohama spot prices were 935 yuan, and futures prices for June were 910 yuan, all exceeding last year's high price records. In addition, New York Japanese silk at 83 degrees and 75 degrees, as well as Chinese silk, all rose by 1 fen yesterday. Lyon Japanese silk and Shanghai silk each rose by 2 francs, while Guangdong silk remained at the original price. In the Shanghai silk market, prices were quite high due to the high prices of Japanese and American silk overseas and the low inventory of silk locally. For example, white factory 85 grade 13-15 price was 940 yuan, 83 grade 31-15 price was 920 yuan, 78 grade 20-13 price was 810 yuan, RR price was 830 yuan, etc. Market prices are still difficult to fully align with overseas markets, so yesterday foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson and Mitsui had term intentions, but only a few firms such as Lien-Nah completed transactions. Trading was not smooth, and the market remained firm. Sales of printed silk and domestic silk were quite active, and market prices rose accordingly, with a total of 152 packages being sold.</p>
<p>American Sales of Hubei Black Tea Are Active</p>
<p>Recently, green tea transactions have been sluggish due to stagnant sales in Morocco, and the market is quite depressed. There is no Qi Ning black tea available in the market, and trading has completely stopped. However, according to news from Hankou, American firms have recently purchased Hubei black tea, totaling more than 5,000 boxes. The price of Zhongguan tea was set at 27 yuan, and the price of secondary tea was 21.5 yuan, averaging 3-4 yuan lower per dan than at the end of last year. It is reported that the reason for the increased sales by American firms is due to the high price of Ceylon tea, and merchants there are buying it to mix.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Fresh Arrivals of White Lead Sheets; Sales of American Tinplate Remain Strong</p>
<p>White Lead Sheets: The market is short of goods and prices are rising. Traders are rushing to purchase from overseas. It is found that in the past few days, more than 1,000 barrels of spot goods have been shipped from Belgium and other countries, so there is no longer a fear of running out of spot goods. It is reported that the opening price is estimated at 170 yuan per barrel for No. 2, 165 yuan for Nos. 3 and 4, 168 yuan for No. 5, 160 yuan for Nos. 6 and 7, and 144-145 yuan for No. 8 and above. It is reported that more than 200 barrels have been offered.</p>
<p>American Tinplate: Since the fixed price from overseas has soared, the local standard has also risen accordingly. Recently, thick-patterned tinplate is estimated at 21.9 yuan, and thin-patterned tinplate is estimated at 22.5 yuan. Sales are still reported to be strong. It is found that there are not many base goods, which makes buyers even more anxious. It is reported that more than 600 dan were offered yesterday.</p>
<h3>Special Article: Wartime Finance by Xi Dongshu (Continued from the Fifth Day's Newspaper)</h3>
<p>— Xi Dongshu</p>
<p>It is no longer possible to raise tax rates, as that would merely place the economic burden on the shoulders of the economically weak in society, violating the principle of equitable taxation. Therefore, we cannot rely on salt taxes as a source of increased revenue when raising war funds. As for consolidated taxes, these include items such as cotton yarn, matches, cigarettes, wheat flour, and cement. These domestic industries are already heavily taxed. Even during wartime, if we barely maintain the status quo, the revenue from consolidated taxes will not increase much; in fact, it will likely decrease rather than increase. Therefore, we can expect that once a crisis arises, this income of tens of millions of yuan will suddenly decrease. Although the amount of the decrease cannot be predicted, it is reasonable to expect that it could decrease by as much as 50%. These remaining tax revenues are only sufficient to cover the government's regular expenditures. If we use them to cover war expenses, they may not even last for two months. When the nation mobilizes and requires huge war funds, we must quickly determine appropriate sources of revenue during the war, otherwise the war funds will be without a source. Now, we can first make an estimate of these vast war expenses to get a general idea.</p>
<p>Estimating war expenses is extremely difficult to do accurately. What we can know is that in future wars, the number of people mobilized, the consumption of weapons and ammunition, and the high cost of mechanized weapons will all cause war expenses to reach unprecedented levels. Countries keep their military preparations secret, so their costs cannot be accurately estimated. At a minimum, we can use the modern European War as a suitable reference for the present. In the European War, the four countries of Germany, Russia, England, and France mobilized a total of more than 12.6 million troops, which was more than four times the number of peacetime standing armies. According to statistics in the Shenbao Yearbook, China currently has more than 2.25 million active soldiers. If we fight with four times this number of people, that would be 9 million people. Based on the fixed monthly salary of 12.8 yuan for the Chinese army, one month's salary alone would cost more than 115.2 million yuan. This does not include the cost of military equipment, ammunition, replacements, and various subsidies and pensions. The enormous cost is evident. During the European War, the daily war expenses for the armies of England, France, Russia, Italy, Germany, and Austria were approximately 17.25 yuan per soldier. Considering the high cost of British volunteers and the low living expenses of Russian and Italian soldiers, even if we take one-third of that cost, at 5.75 yuan per person per day for 9 million people, it would still require 51.75 million yuan per day, totaling 155 million yuan per month. During the European War, the average monthly war expenditure of each belligerent country was the smallest in Italy, at approximately 41.3 million yuan per month. Even if we take half of that, it would still be more than 200 million yuan. We dare to boldly say that once the war starts, the average monthly war expenses will undoubtedly be no less than 100 million yuan. Those of you in the audience are all military experts and must have a clear idea of war expenses. Now, we can study methods for raising these vast war funds.</p>
<p>The original purpose of wartime expenditure is to obtain a large amount of manpower and resources. For the government to increase revenue at this time is to increase its purchasing power of manpower and resources, placing the government in a privileged position in the allocation of manpower and resources, in order to strengthen its resistance. That is the only goal. Wartime revenue must be large and must be swift and not slow. The tax system adopted must enable the government to obtain a large amount of reliable tax revenue within a predetermined period. This type of tax system must also be flexible, so that it can be used at any time to increase tax revenue. The huge funds to be raised must come from the wealthy. Regardless of the method used, whether direct taxation or temporary borrowing, it must come from the affluent class. Because what the government needs, in addition to manpower, is materials, and materials are in the hands of the wealthy, not the poor. Therefore, our revenue must be targeted at wealth, and the target of taxation must fall on wealth. Because wealth and labor, in any period, naturally have a fixed amount. If private individuals use them as much as possible, the government cannot allocate them to meet the needs of the war, which is obvious.</p>
<p>The government can obtain wealth and labor from the people in three main ways: ㊀ requisition, ㊁ taxation, and ㊂ public debt.</p>
<p>Requisition is the compulsory use of property and labor. This type of uncompensated requisition easily makes the burden on the people uneven and causes resentment. If the war is prolonged, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, which is worse than general taxation, where labor is hired and property is purchased with compensation. Therefore, the system of requisition has long been abandoned by civilized countries. During wartime, if you want to obtain a large amount of revenue quickly and effectively, there are only two normal paths: one, increase taxes, and two, borrow money. As mentioned above, wartime taxation should focus on wealth. Wealth taxes are levied on those with economic means, collecting a portion of their earnings from labor or profits. Taxpayers know that it is a one-time sacrifice, so they have no choice but to save on consumption or even make extra efforts in productive enterprises. As a result, people's consumption can be reduced, and the nation's total production can be increased. This is precisely in line with the government's goal during wartime. Moreover, when the entire nation is at a critical juncture of life and death, the people's lives (unfinished)</p>

<h3>Various Public Organizations Telegraph the Central Government to Punish Yang Yu</h3>
<p>And Telegraph Yang Yu to Halt at the Precipice and Preserve His Reputation</p>
<p>Recently, Yang Yu's resistance to orders has become increasingly serious. Various organizations in this city have telegraphed Shaanxi and Gansu, warning Yang Yu to immediately comply with the central government's orders, halt at the precipice, and not become a criminal of the nation. The city's General Labor Union, the City Farmers' Association, and others all sent telegrams yesterday expressing their views. The original telegrams are excerpted below:</p>
<p>City General Labor Union</p>
<p>The City General Labor Union and its affiliated postal, cigarette, cotton spinning, military uniform, pharmaceutical, shipbuilding, silk weaving, silk reeling, water and electricity, public bus, and over one hundred other industrial and vocational unions telegraphed the central government yesterday regarding the serious situation in Shaanxi and Gansu, and warned Yang Yu. The excerpts are as follows: ㊀ Telegram to the Central Committee, Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, and the National Government Military Commission, with respect, the Shaanxi Incident occurred, and the whole country was filled with indignation. Fortunately, the great personality of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the appropriate handling by the central authorities allowed for a swift pacification. The post-incident measures in Shaanxi and Gansu took both law and human sentiment into consideration, and were especially well-received by public opinion. However, even after two weeks, Yang Yu's attitude is still negative, and he has not shown any indication of accepting the clear orders. Recently, he even sent a telegram appointing himself Governor of Shaanxi, clearly indicating his intention to rebel. Such defiance of orders, undermining of unity, providing the enemy with an opportunity to invade, and plunging the people into the abyss of suffering, cannot be tolerated without a clear declaration of war. How can we uphold military discipline and justice? Therefore, we earnestly telegraph, and respectfully request that you quickly dispatch righteous troops to quell the insurgents. It would be fortunate for the country and the nation. ㊀ Warning to Yang Yu, Mr. Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Mr. Yu Xiaohou of Lanzhou, with respect, the central government has decided to handle the aftermath of the Xi'an Incident with leniency, taking both national law and human sentiment into consideration. You should understand the virtuous intentions and strive to atone for your crimes, to clear yourselves before the people of the country. However, news has spread that you not only do not feel grateful, but are also ashamed and angry, and are raising troops to resist orders. We regret this for you. Today, the Chinese people all long for unity, hoping to use the entire national strength to seek the survival of the nation. Those who undermine unity are moths that diminish the nation's strength. Your actions are deeply hated by the people, which is self-evident. Therefore, the result will inevitably be failure, which can also be predicted. We hope you will change your course, so that your reputation can be preserved and the region can avoid devastation. If you persist in your error, it will be too late. We sincerely offer this advice, and hope you will understand. Sincerely, the Shanghai General Labor Union and its affiliated one hundred-plus labor unions.</p>
<p>Two Railway Labor Unions</p>
<p>To all party, government, and military organizations, all groups, all schools, and all newspapers throughout the country, with respect, recently sent a telegram to the central government, which reads: Nanjing Central Party Headquarters (National Government), with respect, regarding the Yang telegram requesting your opinion. After investigation, the central government's post-incident measures for the Shaanxi Incident took both law and human sentiment into consideration, and all Chinese people are convinced. Your concern for maintaining the local area and the soldiers is especially admired by the entire country. However, more than two weeks have passed, and we have not heard of Yang Yu and others complying with the orders. They are truly stubborn and self-righteous, willingly rebelling, providing the enemy with an opportunity to invade, and causing the people to suffer. For the sake of establishing the foundation of the country, we ask the central government to make a decisive decision and quickly issue a clear order to suppress the rebellion and quell the unrest. Nurturing a tumor will only lead to future problems, and domestic stability is necessary for resisting foreign aggression. Moreover, punishing defiance of orders is not comparable to civil war. The will of the entire nation is behind you, and we pledge to be your support. This telegram is sent with utmost urgency, awaiting orders. Sincerely, the railway labor unions directly under the Ministry of Railways, Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. The text: The national crisis is deepening. Domestic stability is necessary for resisting foreign aggression. We hope that everyone will unanimously advocate for national stability. It would be fortunate for the country and the nation. We respectfully send this telegram, awaiting your clear instructions. Sincerely, the railway labor unions directly under the Ministry of Railways, Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. The text:</p>
<p>Seamen's Union</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union telegraphed Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong yesterday, saying: Director Yang Hucheng of Xi'an, Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou, with respect, since the central government issued orders and stipulated post-incident measures for military affairs in Shaanxi and Gansu, it has been to cultivate local vitality and preserve national strength. You have long served in the military, are heavily relied upon, and have always been enthusiastic in supporting the Party and the country. We respectfully request that you comply with the central government's clear orders as an example. It would be fortunate for the country and the people. This telegram is sent with utmost urgency, hoping for your understanding. Sincerely, Peng Bowei, Chairman of the Chinese Seamen's Union, and committee members Lv Shuangxi, Mao Yufeng, Cheng Yongming, and Chen Wenlong, leading 150,000 seamen. Sincerely.</p>
<p>City Farmers' Association Telegram</p>
<p>(Titles Abbreviated) After the Xi'an Incident, the central government's handling of the post-incident military and political affairs in Shaanxi and Gansu was in accordance with both law and human sentiment, and can be said to be an appropriate approach. The people of the whole country sincerely support it, hoping to turn hostility into friendship and establish a solid foundation for the country forever, uniting from top to bottom to strive for resisting foreign aggression and saving the nation, in order to revive the Chinese nation. Unexpectedly, news has spread that you not only have not thoroughly reformed and complied with the central government's established policies, but also intend to resist orders and make abnormal movements, preparing for war, with the idea of willingly becoming friends with the enemy and enemies with the people of the country. Why do you not know to cherish yourselves? Soldiers take obedience as their duty, and stubbornly resisting orders and acting arbitrarily, how can you hope to achieve great things? This is unwise. The central government has generously forgiven the past and will not delve into it. Not knowing to repent and reform, and to be loyal to the Party and the country, is not brave. With one or two people instigating rebellion, the soldiers of the Northeast Army will forever be branded as rebels and abandoned by the people. This is unjust. Betraying the orders of the Party and the country, and opposing the ideas of the leader, is not loyal. Saying that you love the country in this way, who can believe it? Since the Xi'an Incident, the Communists have taken advantage of the opportunity to advance and may still be lingering. You may be deceived by rumors or surrounded by the Red bandits, leading to this absurd action. In that case, you should telegraph your self-explanation, accept the central government's plan, obey orders, maintain local order, and prevent the Communists from succeeding. In short, at a time when foreign aggression is becoming more urgent and the national crisis is deepening, we must not repeat the division and provide the enemy with an opportunity to invade. We hope that you will bravely correct your mistakes, halt at the precipice, and put the country and the nation first, atoning for your crimes and working together to overcome the difficulties. Otherwise, you will isolate yourselves from the people of the country and become enemies of the people. Please think it over. We send this telegram with the utmost anticipation. Sincerely, the Shanghai City Farmers' Association. Sealed.</p>
<p>Northwest Problem Research Association</p>
<p>Due to the renewed tension in the Northwest situation, two telegrams were sent: 1. The telegram to the central government stated that the central government's post-incident measures for Shaanxi and Gansu considered both human sentiment and law, which were admired and supported by the whole country. The members of our association pledge to wholeheartedly support it. 2. The telegram to Yang Yu advised that the central government has not deeply investigated your illegal acts, and its concern is meticulous. You should strive to atone for your crimes. However, since the post-incident measures for Shaanxi and Gansu were announced, we have not seen you comply with the orders, which is very surprising. You must know that the people hate evil as much as they hate their enemies. Anyone who undermines the unity of the country will be abandoned by the masses. We hope that you will halt at the precipice and not isolate yourselves from the people of the country.</p>
<p>Second Special District Citizens' Federation</p>
<p>(Titles Abbreviated) This time, the Xi'an Incident occurred. Fortunately, with the appropriate handling by the central government and the appeal of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's personality, it was quickly pacified. This is extremely fortunate for the nation. We have read the central government's post-incident measures, which stabilize local security, preserve the nation's vitality, and care for your historical subordinates, and can be said to be benevolent and meticulous. For your sake, you should understand the central government's concern for the local area and the soldiers, atone for your crimes, repent, and reform, in order to redeem your past mistakes. However, in the past two weeks, we have heard that you not only have not shown any intention of complying with the orders, but are also deploying troops and building fortifications, taking actions against the orders. At a time when foreign aggression is imminent, the people of the country all hope for unity, resisting foreign aggression and seeking survival. You must want to defy the public opinion of the people of the whole country, but we do not know what your intentions are. If you say that the salaries of your subordinates have no source, then your salaries have already been provided by the national treasury. If you say that your subordinates have no territory, then the central government has already given you the order to remain in your posts. Therefore, there is sufficient guarantee for both territory and salaries. The country's treatment of you cannot be said to be not generous. We do not know what else you are seeking. You must know that the army is the army of the country, and the military force is the military force of the people. You must want to repeat the old tricks of the warlords and hold onto the troops to consolidate your power. Then the past events are not difficult to repeat. Saying that warlords can survive and prosper is impossible. If you resist orders and do not repent, the central government will give the defiant strict punishment. The precious unity of the country will be destroyed by you, and the strength to resist foreign aggression will be lost by you. The enemy is deep and the situation is urgent. Even if you do not consider the country, do you not consider your descendants? If the war starts, the people of the country will regard you as the culprits. Can you still stand between heaven and earth? For your sake, we hope that you will put the country and the nation first, halt at the precipice, and comply with the central government's orders as soon as possible, atoning for your crimes and living up to the expectations of the people. We sincerely plead and await your clear instructions. Sincerely, the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation. Sealed.</p>
<p>Accountant Organizations</p>
<p>The National Association of Accountants and the Shanghai Accountants Association telegraphed Yang Yu yesterday, saying: Director Yang Hucheng of Xi'an, Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou, with respect, the central government's handling of the situation in Shaanxi with generosity was originally to preserve the strength of the country and care for your past achievements. For the country and the people, both were taken into consideration. Those who have benefited from it should feel grateful and strive to repay it. But in the past few days, news has been reported that the situation in Xi'an has entered a state of war. Do you not put the country and the nation first, and still want to resist with troops and provide the enemy with an opportunity to invade? We dare to offer our sincerity, and hope that you will realize it as soon as possible and comply with the orders of the central government, so that the local area can avoid devastation, the national strength will not be slightly damaged, and the great plan for the next hundred years will depend on it. We respectfully send this telegram, hoping for your consideration. Sincerely, the National Association of Accountants, the Shanghai Accountants Association, and the Nanjing Accountants Association. Sincerely.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Sea-Land Intermodal Transport as Usual</h3>
<p>But Freight Transport Above Weinan Is Suspended</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are handling sea-land intermodal transport. Now, because the railway freight cars only reach Weinan, and the bridge repair above Weinan will take time, although the intermodal transport ships between Shanghai and Lianyungang are operating as usual, the intermodal transport of goods to all places above Weinan will be temporarily suspended. The intermodal transport of goods to all places below Weinan will continue as usual.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Directors and Supervisors Held a Farewell Banquet for Ambassador Wang Last Night</h3>
<p>All directors, supervisors, and staff members of the Chinese Red Cross Society and its Relief and Economic Committees held a banquet at the Great Eastern Restaurant at 6 p.m. last night to bid farewell to Wang Zhengting, the president of the society who has been appointed as the new ambassador to the United States. Various speeches were delivered during the banquet. It is reported that Mr. Wang will only embark on his new journey after the conclusion of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. A reporter from the Central News Agency has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>The attendees included Ambassador Wang, Lin Kanghou, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yiting, Wen Lanting, Qu Wenliu, Guan Jiongzhi, Lu Bohong, Cao Yunxiang, Mu Ouchu, Zhao Jinqing, Yan Fuqing, Pang Jingzhou, Jin Runxiang, Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Bangjun, Wang Boqi, and others, totaling sixty to seventy people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Kanghou delivered a speech to bid farewell, stating that since President Wang reorganized the Chinese Red Cross Society, it has begun to take shape. Now that Mr. Wang has been ordered to serve as an ambassador, his colleagues are reluctant to part with him, hence this farewell gathering. He recalled his visit to Siam last year, where he deeply felt that the country's Red Cross Society was grand in scale and fully equipped, surpassing China's by dozens of times. Now that Ambassador Wang is about to go abroad, although he will be working on diplomacy in a foreign country, it is hoped that he will continue to provide assistance and guidance to the Society at any time, so that it may have a direction to follow, and the Red Cross Society's work in China may develop day by day.</p>
<p>Ambassador Wang's Response</p>
<p>Ambassador Wang then delivered a speech of thanks, stating that it was a pleasure to gather with colleagues from the Red Cross Society, as if drinking the New Year's toast twenty-six years ago. Although the Society's work in the past year has been commendable, it is still far from the desired goals. The past is behind us, and the future can be pursued. The suppression of bandits in Suiyuan urgently needs relief, and it is hoped that all directors and supervisors will make special efforts to achieve the planned amount. He had already telegraphed overseas Chinese in Little Luzon for donations, but those in the country should work even harder, and he hoped that the people of the country would work together. He hoped that his shortcomings in the past would be compensated by the continued efforts of everyone to strive for the final victory of the Red Cross Society.</p>
<h3>Difficult Situation for Foreigners in Shaanxi and Gansu</h3>
<p>All Embassies and Legations Order Their Nationals to Leave</p>
<p>A mainland newspaper reports that yesterday, diplomatic officials from various countries in this port were quite concerned about the safety of foreigners in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and planned to find ways to evacuate them as soon as possible. Although they are not in any immediate danger, the situation may change unpredictably, and the situation may worsen in the next few days. Captain Barrett, Deputy Military Attaché of the U.S. Embassy in China, arrived in Luoyang yesterday (the 11th) and will go to Xi'an in the coming days, presumably to oversee the evacuation of American citizens. Captain Scott of the British Embassy arrived in Luoyang two weeks ago. Last night, it was learned that the French Embassy had telegraphed French priests in the two provinces to leave. Authorities in Italy, Germany, and Belgium are also discussing relocation with their nationals in the two provinces. Last night, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy stated that when the Xi'an Incident occurred a month ago, both railway and air transport were cut off, and foreigners had no way to leave the country. Although there are occasional long-distance buses between Tongguan and Xi'an, they are extremely crowded. Therefore, if foreigners in the two provinces want to leave the country today, it will be difficult without obtaining permission from the military authorities to transport them by air. There are approximately 300 foreigners in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, mostly missionaries. British and American citizens number 148. The Inland Mission has approximately 60 missionaries in Xi'an, and other missions also have personnel stationed in Xi'an. The Catholic Church in Lanzhou is one of the largest in the East. The headquarters of various churches in this port received safety messages from personnel in the two provinces two weeks ago, but some have not been heard from since then.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Mr. Herzog, a German pilot for Eurasia Aviation Corporation, flew a Junkers-type giant aircraft from Xi'an to Shanghai on Monday (the 11th) after sunset, carrying four refugees. Mr. Herzog told a reporter from the Shanghai Times that night about the difficulties he encountered and the dangerous situation of foreigners in Xi'an. It was learned that those who came with Mr. Herzog were Mr. and Mrs. Reidel, a German couple, Ms. Walsmann, a Frenchwoman, and Mr. Bohner, a Frenchman. The other person was Mr. Schmidt, the co-pilot. Mr. Herzog and Mr. Schmidt flew to Xi'an on Saturday morning and encountered no problems. Unexpectedly, after landing at Xi'an Airport, they were arrested and confined to a room. They were released on Sunday morning but were escorted back into the city under heavy guard. It is a mystery why they were allowed to fly back. The authorities only allowed foreigners with exit permits to board their plane. Three Russian women begged to board, but because they did not have passports, they were dragged away by soldiers, which was a pitiful sight. The situation of foreign missionaries and other foreigners in Xi'an seems to be quite dangerous. The atmosphere in the city is tense, and one cannot predict what will happen next. Railway transportation has been cut off, and only airplanes can be relied on to escape the dangerous city. However, it is doubtful whether the current situation in Xi'an will allow other planes to visit the city again. In Mr. Herzog's opinion, foreigners in Xi'an, except for missionaries, are now in great danger. If the communist bandits gain power in Xi'an, the missionaries will also be in danger. Mr. Herzog believes that all foreigners in Xi'an want to relocate to safe coastal areas. According to several foreigners who arrived in Shanghai with Mr. Herzog, British and American missionaries in Xi'an are now trying to leave the dangerous city. Mr. Herzog was extremely exhausted due to the difficulties he encountered this time, so his young American wife described everything that happened. According to reports, Mr. Herzog flew a three-engine Junkers aircraft from Berlin to Shanghai last year and then returned to his country. This winter, he came to Shanghai with his wife and is now working for Eurasia Aviation Corporation. He has extensive aviation experience, and his father is a famous German writer who came to China by ship but stopped in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Will Arrive Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Expresses Welcome</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Council, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday aboard the North German Company's "Potsdam" and continued to Shanghai on the same ship that night. According to the ship's company, the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 1 p.m. tomorrow. Central Committee member Chu Minyi came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning at approximately 7 a.m. to welcome Mr. Wang on behalf of Chairman Lin and to arrange everything for Mr. Wang in Shanghai and to receive personnel from all parties who came to Shanghai to welcome him. It is also learned that Ye Chucang, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, Zhao Bulian, Vice-Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and others will come to Shanghai in the next few days to meet with him.</p>
<p>Also, the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions telegraphed Mr. Wang yesterday to express their welcome. The telegram reads, "Mr. Chu Minyi of Shanghai, please forward to Chairman Wang. Since you have been recuperating overseas, the Party has lost its center of gravity. Recently, foreign troubles have become increasingly pressing, and internal disasters have occurred frequently. The people are confused and do not know what to do. It is expected that your return will bring guidance. We hereby telegraph our welcome to extend our congratulations."</p>
<h3>Industrial Associations Host Banquet for Guangxi Inspection Group Last Night</h3>
<p>Invited to a Luncheon by President Sun and Others</p>
<p>The eight-member Guangxi Domestic Inspection Group arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they visited Commander Yang, President Sun, Chairman Huang, and Mr. Zhang Fakui, and were invited to banquets by various parties. The group is scheduled to visit Mayor Wu this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting Commander Yang and Others</p>
<p>At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, the group, led by Zhang Renmin, went to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters in Longhua to visit Commander Yang. Mr. Yang, accompanied by Chief of Staff Ouyang Ju, Adjutant Zhao Weixian, and Secretary Wang Zhinan, received them and expressed a welcome to the group's visit. He also telegraphed to arrange a date to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. They then departed to visit Huang Shaohong, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, and Zhang Fakui, former Director of the Zhejiang Border Area.</p>
<p>Invited to a Banquet by President Sun and Others</p>
<p>At 11 a.m., they went to visit President Sun of the Legislative Yuan. Mr. Sun hosted a banquet at his private residence to welcome them, with Xu Chongzhi, Vice-President of the Control Yuan, and Fu Bingchang, a member of the Legislative Yuan, as guests. At approximately 1 p.m., they went to Xinghualou Restaurant for a banquet hosted by Huang Shaohong and Zhang Fakui.</p>
<p>Banquet Hosted by Industrial Associations</p>
<p>At 6 p.m., the Chinese Industrial Associations and the Guangdong and Guangxi Industrial Inspection Groups held a banquet at the Great Eastern Restaurant for the group. The attendees included guests Zhang Renmin, Guo Shun, Rong Zongjing, Xue Dubi, Mai Huanzhang, Zhang Dingfan, Liu Weizhang, Hu Xiyuan, Cai Shengbai, Wang Zhisheng, Liu Hongsheng, Wu YunChu, Gan Jiehou, Xu Wenming, Huang Jianping, Chen Shaoxian, and more than 50 members of the group's staff and the Federation of Trade Unions. During the banquet, Chairman Guo Shun gave a welcoming speech, stating that the association had previously organized an industrial inspection group to visit Guizhou, and they were grateful for the hospitality and guidance they received. Now that the group is passing through Shanghai, they have prepared a small feast to show the hospitality of the hosts. It is heard that the group is paying close attention to industrial aspects during this inspection. Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce in China, and it is hoped that they will stay for a few days to provide guidance so that the industrial circles of the country can communicate and seek common development. Zhang Renmin then gave a speech of thanks and expressed his willingness to do his best to help develop industry. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Visiting the Mayor This Morning</p>
<p>The group is scheduled to visit Mayor Wu in the city center at 9 a.m. this morning and pay tribute to the martyrs' cemetery at 10 a.m. They will also visit leaders of local associations and other organizations. At 4 p.m., Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, will host a tea party at the World Society to welcome them. At 6 p.m. tomorrow, Xue Dubi, a member of the Central Committee, will host a banquet for the group at Dongxinglou Restaurant. Starting tomorrow, the group will visit various national product factories in the city.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Shaanxi Telegraphs Operate as Usual</h3>
<p>Lanzhou Line Temporarily Difficult to Repair</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation states that wireless telegraphs between Shanghai and Xi'an have been restored since the resolution of the Shaanxi Incident and have not been interrupted. However, wired telegraphs between Shanghai and Lanzhou have been blocked due to the inability to repair the poles and lines for the time being. Wireless telegraphs are still working, but telegraphs in both places are very congested.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Establishes Longhai Railway Debt Restructuring Fund</h3>
<p>Belgium Agrees to Lend 50 Million Yuan for Materials to Construct Baoji-Chengdu Railway</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway debt has been discussed between the Ministries of Finance and Railways, the Belgian company, and representatives of the creditors last year, and a restructuring plan has been agreed upon. It was also stipulated that a fund management committee be established to handle the principal and interest payments. It was recently learned that the committee has been organized. There are five members on the committee. The chairman is the Minister of Railways. The other four members are Tao Changshan, Director of the Public Debt Department representing the Ministry of Finance, Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Administration representing the Ministry of Railways, Zhang Jingli, Director of the Finance Department of the Ministry of Railways, and Lang Beier, representing the Belgian company. It is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting on the 13th of this month, and thereafter meet once a month. It is also heard that after the Longhai Railway debt is restructured, the credit of the Chinese government's railway is restored. The Belgian company knows that the Ministry of Railways has a plan to build the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, so it is willing to sign another contract to purchase materials, totaling 450 million Belgian francs, equivalent to approximately 50 million yuan in national currency, to be used to build the Baoji-Chengdu line. The terms of the materials loan are excellent, with an interest rate of 6% per week. The method of repayment does not specify a repayment fund and is guaranteed by the Ministry of Railways. The collateral is the future income of the Baocheng Railway and the surplus from the Bianluo section of the Longhai Railway after deducting the old loan mortgages. The road construction project is huge. It is heard that it is currently under survey. Once the survey is completed, the Ministry of Railways will raise cash and start construction on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Travel Records of Prominent People</h3>
<p>Tan Zhen and Xiao Zheng traveled to Nanjing on the night express train yesterday.</p>
<p>Pan Yunchao left Beijing on the express train yesterday afternoon and arrived in Shanghai at 9:30 p.m. last night.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Handles International Convenience Remittances</h3>
<p>Efforts to Reduce Remittance Fees and Connect Overseas Chinese Economy</p>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has been paying close attention to business development in recent years. The recent new facilities of the Bureau are listed as follows: ㊀ Handling International Convenience Remittances: Because overseas Chinese have been away from their motherland for a long time, they are inevitably separated from the situation of the motherland. Therefore, convenience remittance has been created. Whenever overseas Chinese contact remittance to the motherland, in addition to guiding the currency conversion method at any time, the remittance fee will be reduced. After the implementation of this method, overseas Chinese are extremely convenient. ㊁ Adding Warehouses: The Bureau recently found that Wuxi has a large area and a large population. The annual output and other agricultural products transiting through the counties are more than 3 million dan. For the purpose of regulating the rural economy, a warehouse has been added to the county, and 200,000 yuan has been allocated from the savings item to handle rural mortgage loans. Various arrangements have been prepared, and the official opening will be in this month. ㊂ Life Insurance and Children's Savings: The state-run simple life insurance handled by the Bureau has been enthusiastically subscribed to since it was launched last year. In the future, it is planned to be extended to remote provinces to make it universal. At the same time, children's savings are also being promoted in many ways. Various promotional materials have been printed and distributed to households and schools. Parents and principals are requested to encourage children to save.</p>

<h3>American Famous Writer Pfeiffer Lectures on Far East Issues Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japanese Society is Extremely Contradictory and Has Followed in the Footsteps of Europe and the United States. China's Recent Approach is Also Thought-Provoking</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the International Problems Research Association and the Pacific Association held a grand joint event at the Licha Hotel on Huangpu Road at noon yesterday to welcome Mr. Pfeiffer, a well-known American journalist and writer who recently came to China for inspection. In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Pfeiffer, the attendees included Australian Trade Commissioner to China, Puden, Finnish Consul General in Shanghai, Nisganen, Powell, editor of the Miller Review, Colber, U.S. Assistant Commercial Counselor, Howard, editor of the Zilin West Report, Pan Gengsi, Secretary of the Young Women's Association, Hume, Consultant of Shanghai Medical College, and Guo Bingwen, Li Zhaohuan, He Dekui, Dai Zhiqian, Zhou Jue, Zhang Xianglin, Kuang Fuzhuo, Li Yaobang, Chen Bingzhang, Mei Qiju, Tang Wenkai, Cheng Haifeng, Liu Yuwan, Dai Baoliu, Kuang Yaokun, Chen Zhi, Mei Guozhen, and other Chinese and foreign guests, totaling more than 100 people. After taking their seats, Guo Bingwen, Chairman of the International Problems Research Association, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the two associations, stating that Mr. Pfeiffer is a leading expert on Far Eastern politics in the United States. Years ago, he wrote books such as "The Plight of the White Man" based on his observations, which provided a clear description of China's international relations. Now he has come to the sea again to investigate the progress of China's various undertakings in recent years and issues such as diplomacy and internal affairs. In the future, he will write new works based on his keen observations, which will surely be a greater success. Then, Mr. Pfeiffer stood up and gave a speech, "An Outsider's View of the Far East Problem," stating that he first came to China in 1915. In the following 20 years, he paid close attention to the study of the Far East problem. However, since returning to the United States in 1929, he has only come to China again today for investigation. Time flies, and more than seven years have passed in a blink of an eye. During these seven years, the various changes in world politics have been extremely fantastic. International conflicts and contradictions have become more acute. Is a great war about to recur? Is humanity about to be destroyed? Is modern culture about to collapse? Those in the know are often concerned about this. However, according to his observations, the causes of the various evils in Europe and Asia are nothing more than the following two points: Since the Napoleonic Wars, for more than 100 years, European countries have followed the path of nationalism, which has led to today's mutual suspicion, market competition, and fratricidal killings among imperialist countries. Also, since the industrial revolution, European countries have tried to develop various industries, only focusing on the progress of material things and the increase of production, without considering the various adverse consequences that occur in society, such as unemployment strikes, etc., thus creating the most common state of anxiety in the world today. European people today have deeply felt the pain of being caught in a whirlpool and unable to extricate themselves. However, the Far East does not take this as a warning, but instead follows suit. Will the results be the same? Take Japan as an example. It has been deeply influenced by European and Asian culture, so its development is similar to that of Europe and the United States. Therefore, it has caused many disputes in the international community, and the various social conditions in the country also show an extremely contradictory and uneasy scene. The path taken by China in recent years, generally speaking, is nothing more than focusing on developing material construction and promoting nationalism. Will the result be the same as the mistakes of Europe and the United States? Will it lead to a fierce war? Due to the influence of certain environments, Chinese people may think that it is necessary to take this path. However, what will be the result of following this path in the future is an extremely thought-provoking question. The speaker has not been in China for a long time this time, and has not been able to conduct in-depth research on various issues. He is only raising this question in particular, and hopes that you will discuss it in detail.</p>

<h3>Longxing Special Express Ship Delayed in Reaching Hankou</h3>
<p>Various Reasons for Delay of One Day</p>
<p>The Longxing, a special express ship of the Sanbei Company on the Yangtze River, departed from Shanghai at midnight on the 9th of this month and was originally scheduled to arrive in Hankou at midnight on the 11th, with a scheduled 48 hours, including berthing at various ports and loading and unloading cargo (including 5 hours at the berths), to reach its destination. However, the ship was limited to 14 hours from Shanghai to Nanjing, but the first departure took 17 hours to reach Nanjing, three hours longer. By 8 p.m. on the 10th, it arrived in Jiujiang. Because the cargo on board was not loaded in Nanjing, Wuhu, Anhui and other places, only more than 3,000 pieces were shipped to Jiujiang for unloading. According to the limitation, it took three hours to unload the goods in Jiujiang. Unexpectedly, the weather was unusually cold that night, and the loading was slow at night, which lasted for a total of 12 hours before it was unloaded. As a result, the upstream schedule was delayed. Yesterday morning, the ship left Jiujiang for Hankou. The river water in the Xunhan section has been falling sharply for days, with only 9 feet and 7 inches, making navigation more difficult. Therefore, it is expected that it will arrive in Hankou this morning, but it is already a day later than the original schedule.</p>

<h3>Xiao Songqin Flew to Hong Kong Yesterday Morning to Transfer to Siam</h3>
<p>To Welcome His Father to Beijing</p>
<p>The Central Executive Committee dispatched Mr. Xiao Songqin to Siam to welcome Xiao Focheng, a member of the Central Standing Committee, to Beijing to discuss the crucial plan for unity against foreign aggression. It was learned that Xiao Songqin arrived in Shanghai on the 10th and took a flight to Hong Kong the morning before yesterday. He will transfer to a flight to French Hanoi or a flight to Singapore, taking a detour to Siam. If the ship schedule from Siam is suitable, Mr. Xiao Focheng will be able to arrive in Beijing before the Third Plenary Session. The following are the exploration notes from President Yu and President Sun: ❶ President Yu's letter states, "As the Third Plenary Session is approaching, the Central Committee has specially dispatched Mr. Xiao Songqin to respectfully invite you. We earnestly hope for your early arrival to guide everything. The country is in dire straits, and our party bears the responsibility. To save the nation and ensure survival, we rely on elders like you. This letter is sent to welcome you. Words cannot fully express my thoughts. I wish you peace and blessings." ❷ President Sun's letter states, "It has been a long time since I received your teachings, and I deeply miss you. I hope you are in good health. The national crisis is deepening, and a strong neighbor is pressing upon us. We cannot survive without unity, and we cannot strive without resisting Japan. This is what you have always advocated, and what our colleagues in the Central Committee encourage themselves with day and night. Recently, the unrest has gradually subsided, and the country is roughly stabilized. Colleagues in the Central Committee eagerly await your arrival in Beijing to discuss the great plan to resist foreign aggression. I hope you will consider the difficulties of the times and embark on the journey soon. I urge you to come quickly and will be waiting anxiously. I respectfully wish you good health." ❸ Vice President Kong's letter states, "It has been a long time since I have heard from you, and I deeply miss you. I hope you are well and in good health. I am eagerly anticipating your arrival. The Xi'an Incident shocked the entire country. Although Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has escaped danger and the overall situation has stabilized somewhat, the national crisis is still severe, and the hidden worries are great. Without common unity, we cannot save the country from peril. Without the advocacy of veteran statesmen, we cannot achieve unity. You, sir, are respected at home and abroad for your advanced age and great virtue. Your help in times of trouble will surely lead to success. I hope you will come north as soon as possible to discuss national affairs. I am eagerly awaiting your arrival. Taking advantage of your son Songqin's return south, I hastily write this to urge you to come and inquire about your well-being."</p>
<h3>Business Account Books Can Have Stamps Affixed</h3>
<p>After the End of the Overall Accounting Period</p>
<p>Yan Ersheng, Secretary of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, announced that recently, due to the end of the Gregorian calendar year, merchants have been inquiring about the replacement of stamps on business account books, asking whether it should be based on the end of the Gregorian calendar year or the end of the business's overall accounting period. According to the third collection of the "Compilation of Examples of the Implementation Regulations of the Stamp Tax Law" issued by the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance, it contains a document from the Ministry of Finance approving the Beijing General Chamber of Commerce on December 11, 1935, stating that according to the Stamp Tax Law, account books should have a stamp worth two cents affixed annually, so the validity of the stamp should end at the end of December in the Gregorian calendar year. However, the Ministry has considered that merchants often replace account books after the overall business accounting, so the detailed rules for the implementation of the Stamp Tax Law have clearly stipulated in Article 10 that the validity of the stamp tax on account books should end on the date of the overall business accounting, in order to show flexibility and provide convenience. Furthermore, on April 10, 1936, the Ministry of Finance instructed Gu Xianzeng, the Stamp Tax Commissioner, stating that the detailed rules for the implementation of the Stamp Tax Law clearly stipulate in Article 10 that the validity of the stamp on account books should end on the date of the overall business accounting. Therefore, the original stamp affixed on the account book is still valid before the date of the overall business accounting, and its use during this valid period cannot be punished. According to the above approval, merchants can replace stamps on business account books after the customary overall accounting period.</p>
<h3>Japanese Exchange Rate Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>The Central Bank Still Quotes Fictitious Prices</p>
<p>After Japan implemented controlled foreign exchange management, the Japanese exchange rate in Shanghai immediately fell. Although Japanese banks made large purchases, they still failed to restore the original price. Yesterday, the Central Bank quoted a fictitious price of 103 yuan for 100 yuan of national currency. Sellers offered 100 yuan for 102.85 yuan, which was about four cents lower than the previous day's market price. Buyers only included Japanese banks purchasing over one million yuan. Other British, American, and French merchants remained cautious, and transactions were still sluggish.</p>
<h3>Large Ships Stop Going to Hankou Due to Low River Water Levels</h3>
<p>Only Reach Jiujiang</p>
<p>After the Yangtze River water level decreased last winter, it increased again. Unexpectedly, in the past two days, due to the cold weather, the water level in the upper reaches decreased rapidly, with only a little over nine feet remaining. The section from Jiujiang to Hankou is experiencing more and more shoals in places such as Xiaogushan and Huangshigang, and the water level is further decreasing. Ships with deeper drafts are no longer able to sail upstream. Therefore, the Taikoo Company has decided to stop large river ships such as the Wuchang, Huangpu, Wenzhou, and Wusong from going to Hankou, only reaching Jiujiang. Those with shallower drafts are also reducing their cargo. If the water level continues to fall, there is a risk of navigation being interrupted in the upper reaches.</p>
<h3>Banking Association Sends Letters to Members Urging Them to Report Last Year's Profits</h3>

According to customary practice, the profit figures of each bank are reported to the Banking Association for compilation and publication. It has been learned that as of yesterday, the association has received reports from less than ten banks, and various parties are paying close attention to this information, hoping for early publication. Therefore, the association specially sent letters to member banks yesterday urging them to complete the reports as soon as possible for compilation and announcement. It is said that the Central Bank had the highest profits last year, with a net profit of over nine million yuan after expenses.</p>

The first and second batches of goods have already been transported to Suiyuan for distribution, and the third batch of goods is urgently awaiting transport. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Railways requesting various bureaus to transfer them. Yesterday, a reply telegram was received from Minister Zhang Jia'ao of the Ministry of Railways, stating, "To the Shanghai United Disaster Relief Association of Charity Organizations, your telegram has been read. Your association has a third batch of relief goods, including silk floss vests and cotton clothing and gloves, totaling twenty-two packages, to be transported from Shanghai to Suiyuan for distribution. We have instructed the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, Beining, and PingSui Railway Bureaus to expedite the loading and transportation at half price on the account of the Disaster Relief Committee.

<h3>The Ministry of Industry is Preparing to Establish a Tea Inspection and Management Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Organization Has Begun</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry believes that our country has abundant tea production and a vast production area. However, tea farmers adhere to outdated methods and do not think about improvement, resulting in reduced production and inferior quality, which has a significant impact on foreign sales. Currently, the National Product Inspection Committee is establishing a tea production area inspection and management office in Shanghai to effectively supervise and improve tea and promote production. Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and Wu Juenong, Director, have been appointed as the Director and Deputy Director of the Management Office. After receiving the order, Cai and Wu have begun preparing for organization in accordance with the provisional regulations issued by the Ministry of Industry and plan to officially establish the office within the month. In the future, depending on the situation, offices will be established in major production and sales areas to oversee inspection matters during the tea marketing period. It is understood that various countries have done a good job in inspecting tea production areas, and our country is conducting inspections for the first time. However, this inspection is crucial to the overall tea improvement and development of foreign sales. The Tea Production Area Inspection and Management Office has decided to explore the inspection methods of various European and American countries and strictly implement them.</p>

<h3>Husband Sues for Divorce Due to Wife's Dementia</h3>
<p>Disregarding Marital Affection Judge's Mediation Fails</p>
<p>Gao Zhengyao from Minhou, Fujian, is an employee of the Postal Administration. On December 19, 1931, he married Lin Ci'ai, a woman from the same hometown, through a matchmaker. The couple's relationship was initially harmonious. However, in the autumn of 1933, Lin Ci'ai unfortunately suffered from dementia, which has not been cured for more than three years. Gao Zhengyao then hired a lawyer to file a petition for divorce with the District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Yuan held a court hearing. Gao Zhengyao testified that after the defendant suffered from mental illness, he borrowed money to treat her for four years. Now it has become an incurable disease, and there is no hope for lifelong happiness. The fault lies with the defendant, so he requests a divorce. The defendant Lin Ci'ai was not present, but a lawyer appeared in court on her behalf and filed a counterclaim for alimony, stating that the defendant unfortunately became ill involuntarily. Now the plaintiff requests a divorce and abandons this patient, which violates humanitarianism. Law should not go against human sentiment, so even if the divorce is acceptable, Gao Zhengyao should bear the obligation to support his wife, especially since her illness has not been definitively proven to be incurable. Therefore, if the plaintiff insists on divorce, he should be ordered to pay the defendant 3,600 yuan in alimony. The judge then advised the plaintiff, considering that the defendant became ill after marriage and that there should be pity for the marital affection, to think back to the past and still provide alimony so that there would be no guilt in his heart. The plaintiff agreed to pay 1,000 yuan, which must be paid monthly. The defendant's lawyer did not agree, and reconciliation was hopeless. The debate then began, and it was immediately announced that the debate was concluded, and the judgment would be announced on the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>Jin Jingfang and Zhang Dingyi, Unmarried Couple, Involved in Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Believing It Was Harmless Judge Orders Personal Appearance in Court</p>
<p>Zhang Dingyi, 27 years old, a local resident residing at 21 Dou Market Street, has recently been sued for seduction by a young woman named Jin Jingfang through her lawyer in the District Court. The lawsuit states that the defendant coveted her beauty and pursued her last January, claiming to be unmarried and intending to marry her. The plaintiff, being young and inexperienced, agreed to an engagement. The defendant then further sought physical intimacy, and the plaintiff, believing that they were unmarried couples and that it was harmless, was seduced. It was only recently that she learned that the defendant already had a wife at home, which constitutes a violation of Article 229 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Liu Bojun held a court hearing. Neither party was present, but lawyers for each party appeared in court to plead their cases. The judge scheduled a new date to summon the parties to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Yang Weiqin Sues Luo Chunshan for Breach of Trust and Embezzlement Trial Begins</h3>
<p>Luo Not Present Hearing Postponed</p>
<p>Yang Weiqin from Shaoxing, residing at 14 Fujian Road, sued Luo Chunshan, residing at 51 Hou Guan Temple, Ximen, in the District Court for breach of trust and embezzlement. Yesterday, Judge Yu Lude held a court hearing. Yang Weiqin testified that on June 14, 1936, he opened the Yutong Rice Mill outside Tongjimen, Nanjing, with a total of ten shares. He had four shares, worth 1,000 yuan. There were also shareholders Chen Yishi and Zhao Bingheng. The defendant Luo Chunshan also had one share and served as the manager. Later, due to poor business, operations ceased on September 13. On September 12, he went to Nanjing to audit the accounts and found a loss of nearly 2,000 yuan. He discovered that the reason for the loss was that the defendant was privately trading grain with their money, embezzling their profits, which led to the closure of the business. He also misused more than 150 yuan and forged a seal to withdraw more than 1,000 yuan from the Shanghai Bank. In addition, 376 yuan from the rice bag account was also embezzled, totaling more than 2,460 yuan. The accountant Zhang XinYuan can testify. Since the defendant was not present, the hearing was postponed to a later date.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur sues on behalf of his son to confirm paternity</h3>
<p>Miss Xue Xiang, Before Marriage, an affair, A son, already eighteen years old, the lawsuit only starts now</p>
<p>Xue Xiangjie, daughter of the giant dye merchant Xue Baorun, is currently married to Xu Liangchen, a real estate businessman residing at No. 2, Lane 106, Maitesi Road. Having had no children of her own, Wang Genbao, a young man from Wuxian who is eighteen years old and residing at No. 11, Renyuan Lane, Bai'er Road, has been represented by his father Wang Yongquan as a legal representative. They have hired lawyer Chen Wen and filed a lawsuit against Mr. and Mrs. Xu and Xue in the First Special District Court to confirm that he is their son. The facts are that Wang Yongquan worked as a chauffeur at Xue Baorun's home in 1918, and Xue Xiangjie was still unmarried at the time. Because Wang was young and quick-witted, he was admired, and after some time, an ambiguous relationship developed. After several romantic encounters, Xue became pregnant in secret. To avoid the eyes and ears of her family, she rented a house at No. 292, Taian Lane, Beishanxi Road, to temporarily give birth. On the day of Huachao in 1919 (February 12 of the lunar calendar), a boy was born and named Genbao. The meaning of his name is "to have a foundation" with his maternal grandfather, Mr. Baorun. Later, as the news spread, there were complaints from the family, and Xue ordered Wang Yongquan to resign to avoid the scandal. However, the relationship still existed, and they continued to communicate secretly. When Xue Xiangjie married Xu Liangchen, she even gave Wang 500 yuan to support Genbao. However, since then, the gate to the mansion has been closed, and it has been difficult to meet. Recently, they sent a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Xu and Xue requesting recognition, but they were ignored, so they filed a lawsuit requesting that the landlord of Taian Lane and the midwife who delivered the baby be summoned to testify or that a blood test be performed to confirm that Genbao was indeed born to the defendants. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Gongdian of the Special First Court heard the case in Civil Court 7. Wang Yongquan was not present, but Wang Genbao and lawyer Chen were present, while Mr. and Mrs. Xu and Xue were not present, but lawyers E Shen and Tang Shenpei were present. First, the plaintiff stated the facts of the case, and lawyer E Shen denied the facts stated by the plaintiff, saying that the defendant had never given birth and that it was unclear whether the plaintiff's father, Wang Yongquan, was a servant of the father's family. After Judge Xu verified the testimony, he ordered that the case be rescheduled for a hearing with witnesses.</p>
<h3>The Debate on the Case of the Assassination of Yin Bengen is Concluded</h3>
<p>The Presiding Judge, Due to Unclear Facts, Will Conduct a Detailed Investigation to Avoid Wrongful Conviction</p>
<p>Yin Bengen, a man from Anhui who formerly worked as a detective in the French Concession Police, was shot and killed on the night of October 11 of last year in Wujia Lane, Qianjiatang, French Concession. The French Concession Police arrested the suspect Wang Dianhua, also known as Wang Laowu, a man from Anhui, and the person involved, Wu Weicai, and sent them to the Special First Court. The lawyer from the Police Department prosecuted them for the crime of joint murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Judge Wang Gangxu conducted the trial. According to Wang's confession, he was hired by Wang Kaifu and Ma Changshou, who are on the run, to kill Yin. Wu Weicai admitted to conspiracy beforehand. The court ordered them to be detained in the detention center pending further investigation. However, during the subsequent trial, both defendants recanted their confessions, claiming that they confessed because they could not bear the torture in the Police Department. Witnesses were summoned for questioning, and lawyers were appointed to defend the defendants. The court announced the conclusion of the debate. The judgment was originally scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM yesterday. However, Judge Yu Gangxu, who was presiding over the case, believed that the facts were not yet clear and needed to be thoroughly investigated to avoid wrongful conviction. Therefore, at around 2:00 PM yesterday, he went to Criminal Court 1 and ordered that the two defendants be brought to the case and announced the rescission of the conclusion of the debate, rescheduling the debate for 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Robber's Confession Implicates Young Woman</h3>
<p>Affecting Marital Reputation Young Woman Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Zhu Jinrong from Dongtai, residing at No. 14, Xingxing Village, Luban Road, was robbed of his horse-riding breeches, coat, hat, wallet, and French currency by thugs on the night of the 26th of last month while passing through Damuqiao. Zhu recognized a man named Lu Rongtai, so he asked the Ximen Branch to arrest Lu. However, Lu claimed that he was acquainted with Liu Baolin, a 19-year-old girl from Yangzhou residing at No. 6, Dingji Lane, Damuqiao. Later, the girl had a relationship with Zhu's father, and due to a love triangle, he was falsely accused of theft. After this situation was reported in the newspaper, Liu Baolin was outraged, claiming that she did not know Zhu, let alone have a relationship with Chen. Such a false confession would greatly affect her future marriage and reputation, so she filed a lawsuit with the District Court requesting that Lu Rongtai be punished for the crime of defamation. The court dispatched police to bring Lu to the court, and the prosecutor questioned him once before ordering him to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Raided on Xingang Road</h3>
<p>The Tiansheng Tea Garden at No. 4, Xingang Road, Zhabei, is owned by Song Rongchang, a local resident. Recently, due to sluggish business, Song colluded with several gamblers to set up a private gambling den, enticing male and female gamblers to gamble on Pai Gow, Yaotang, poker, mahjong, Huawa and other games. They entered and exited day and night, winning and losing large sums of money, and Song and others profited from it. However, the matter was not kept secret and was reported to the Linping Road Police Station. The police station believed that gambling and skimming profits would hinder public order. Yesterday at around 4:50 PM, inspector Lu Baoqing and Sergeant Luo Mingqi led a large number of officers to the address to search and arrest. At the time, the gamblers were happily calling out numbers when they suddenly saw the police arriving.

<h3>Oil Paint Trademark Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Wanli Sues Hongyuan and Jixing; Trial Concludes Yesterday, Judgment Scheduled</p>
<p>Feng Mingqing, Deputy Manager of Wanli Paint Oil Factory on Xietu Road in the Nanshi District, along with his attorney, Jia Shishi, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing Pan Liquan, Manager of Hongyuan Paint Store, and Hu Hongzhao, compradore of the British Jixing Foreign Firm, of counterfeiting trademarks in violation of Article 253 of the Criminal Code. They also filed a civil suit seeking compensation for all losses amounting to $2,293.79, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan Zhenyang presided over the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. The defendant Hu Hongzhao did not appear and was represented by attorney Dan Yuhua. Pan Liquan appeared with his defense attorney, Zhang Ding.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, Feng Mingqing, stated that in the autumn of last year, the Ministry of Railways invited bids for the purchase of oil paint, and Hongyuan Paint Store won the bid. Pan Liquan, the manager of Hongyuan, placed an order with the plaintiff's company for "Sailing Boat" brand oil paint and invited Hu Hongzhao to act as guarantor. Subsequently, a dispute arose regarding the delivery of goods, which led to complications, and the deal fell through. Unexpectedly, Hu secretly introduced the British Yongguang Oil Paint Company to undertake the production, and the two defendants, Pan and Hu, forged the plaintiff's registered "Sailing Boat" trademark at Hu's house and printed it on the paint buckets for delivery. Upon receiving a tip, the plaintiff sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the allegations. Two photographs were taken, and the two paint buckets (genuine and fake) along with the registration certificate were submitted as evidence.</p>
<p>Defendant Pan Liquan testified that after the defendant won the bid for the Ministry of Railways' oil paint purchase, but failed to finalize his order with the plaintiff, he purchased oil paint from the British Yongguang Oil Paint Factory and created his own "Ship" brand trademark. In September of last year, he sold the oil paint to the Ministry of Railways at a price of $13.75 per five-gallon bucket. The paint buckets were marked as "Produced by Hongyuan of Nanjing." The trademark used by the defendant was the "Ship" brand, which had been approved for registration by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce last year with approval number 24720. Item two of the approval document clearly states "roof, bridge, anti-rust paint, and various oil paints and spray paints etc." The plaintiff's trademark is the "Sailing Boat" brand, and there are no words indicating anti-rust paint on the registration certificate. The trademark names are therefore dissimilar. The defendant claimed that it was in fact the plaintiff who was trying to infringe his trademark rights, and furthermore, the "Sailing Boat" trademark on the plaintiff's registration certificate has a complete unbroken circle around it, whereas the defendant's trademark has a broken, discontinuous circle. Now the plaintiff, seeking to establish a crime against the defendant, has deliberately painted the complete circle on the paint bucket submitted as evidence today as a discontinuous circle, in the hope that the court would make a hasty judgement that the trademarks are similar. This deceitful scheme would certainly backfire.</p>
<p>Following the defendant’s statement, his attorney Zhang Ding presented the registration certificate and trademark publication as evidence. After arguments from both parties’ lawyers, the court adjourned to schedule a date for judgment.</p>

<h3>Xie Yibin's Family's Two Adopted Daughters Flee After Stealing Money</h3>
<p>Staying in Hotels, Buying New Clothes, and Attending Theater; Prosecuted for Theft After Arrest</p>
<p>Xie Yibin, a comprador for the Bestime Foreign Firm and a Chaozhou native, lived with his wife, Xie Zhengshi, at No. 12, Tongchunfang, Baike Road. At 7:30 PM on the 7th of this month, Xie's 15-year-old adopted daughter, Xie Hongmei, from Danyang, and his 12-year-old maid, Chen Jinxi, from Chaozhou, suddenly disappeared. Xie Zhengshi discovered that 40 legal tender dollars and a jade necklace worth a total of $300 were missing from a drawer in the dressing table. Suspecting that the two girls had stolen them, she reported the theft to the Xinzha Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>After stealing the money and fleeing, the two girls went together to the Ningfeng Hotel at No. 524, Minguo Road, under the false surname of Wang, and booked room number 6. After pawning the necklace for cash, they purchased new clothes and attended the Gongwu Theater for three consecutive days. Until around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, Xie Hongmei was walking alone at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road when she was spotted by Xie Yibin's tea servant, Xiao Daming. He took Xie Hongmei to the police station. Upon interrogation, it was learned that Chen Jinxi was still in front of the Gongwu Theater. Detective Ding Huaguo went and apprehended Chen, and they were both taken to the police station.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted them for theft under Article 320, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, stating that because the stolen goods had not yet been recovered, he requested an extension. Subsequently, Xie Zhengshi stated that Hongmei was adopted in 1931, and Jinxi had been hired as a maid four months ago for the price of 65 yuan. Now that they have conspired to steal money and flee, they should be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Xie Hongmei admitted to stealing only 40 legal tender dollars, without the necklace, and fleeing with Chen to the Ningfeng Hotel. The stolen money had all been spent on buying clothes. Chen Jinxi stated that Hongmei asked her to steal the 40 legal tender dollars, and there was also a necklace that Hongmei stole. Although she did not see it at the time, she saw it in a rickshaw afterward.</p>
<p>Judge Zhan Liangce reviewed the statements and ordered the two girls to be detained for further questioning next Saturday.</p>

<h3>Putuoshan Monk Acquitted Again After Retrial</h3>
<p>Reverend You Ming, the abbot of Faru Temple on the back mountain of Putuoshan, who is over sixty years old, came to Shanghai two years ago to solicit donations. He resided at No. 1, Zhaofuli, Lafayette Road in the French Concession. Rogue Qiu Zhongyuan, along with Zhang A'yuan, who is still at large, colluded with Wang A'mei (also known as Dai A'wei), a young woman from Ningbo who lived in the same pavilion room as You Ming, to remove You Ming's clothes and take photographs. They then took him to the Oriental Hotel and extorted three thousand dollars, forcing him to write a promissory note. Later, You Ming returned to the mountain and reported it to the Buddhist Association, which reported it to the French Police, who arrested Qiu Zhongyuan, Wang A'mei, and Wang's mother, Wang Zhangshi (also known as Dai Zhangshi), and prosecuted them in the Second Special Court. As a result, Qiu was sentenced to six months in prison and fined four hundred dollars. Wang A'mei and Wang Zhangshi were each sentenced to three months in prison.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Wang A'mei's ex-husband, Shao Ruikang, first filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Qiu Zhongyuan, Wang A'mei, Wang Zhangshi, and others of interfering with the family. The court ruled that it did not meet the requirements for legal proceedings and rejected the case. Later, Shao Ruikang again filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court, accusing Monk You Ming of adultery with Wang A'mei and interfering with the family. The initial trial sentenced You Ming to three months in prison. You Ming appealed to the Third High Court, which overturned the original verdict and acquitted You Ming.

<h3>Robbery of Graveyard Keeper</h3>
<p>Eight or Nine Robbers Arrived Suddenly</p>
<p>Song Guiqing and Song Laohu, brothers from Haimen, were flower gardeners in Yaojiawan Bridge, west of Caohejing Town in the western suburbs of Shanghai. Last year, they were recommended to work as graveyard keepers in the Zhou family cemetery behind the Henan Chihe circle in the town. Their wives and children also lived with them in the graveyard hut. They had also built three flower sheds on the open ground. Guiqing was sleeping in the shed. As the end of the lunar year was approaching, rent and other fees were due. He had recently borrowed more than thirty national currency dollars from a friend to pay the rent. Unexpectedly, around 1:00 AM the night before last, they suddenly heard Guiqing shouting in the flower shed. Laohu immediately opened the door and saw eight or nine robbers with Jiangbei accents holding sharp knives and flashlights rush in. They pulled out their knives and clubs, warning them not to make any noise. They first tied up the men and women one by one with ropes, and then calmly searched and robbed them of all their cash, clothes, quilts, and bicycles. The robbers were still not satisfied and beat Laohu and his wife and Guiqing with wooden sticks, forcing them to talk, causing them to be injured. After about three hours, the robbers left with their loot, heading north. Later, they managed to bite through the ropes and reported the robbery to the Caohejing Inspection Bureau, requesting that they be apprehended and brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Child's Corpse, Head Severed, Abdomen Torn</h3>
<p>Sun Lu-shi Detained for Attempting to Steal the Burial Cloth</p>

It was wrapped in a rush mat and abandoned by the roadside. A woman, Sun Lu-shi, passed by and attempted to take the burial cloth. However, a passerby, Chen Yong-yi, noticed and reported her to the local police, who detained her on suspicion of injury. She was handed over to the Police Headquarters for questioning. Simultaneously, the local bailiff was ordered to report to the court for inspection and to dispatch police officers to investigate the cause of death of the child.

<h3>Underage Girl Elopes with Tailor</h3>
<p>Yang Fu-shan, a 41-year-old man from Chuansha, runs a tailor shop at No. 31 Jingfu Li, Ju Fanda Road, in the French Concession to make a living. He has a daughter named Da-mei, who is only 14 years old. On some day of this month, in the afternoon, she took two gold rings, four gold hairpins, one gold hairpin piece, and one pair of gold bracelets and ran away on her own. Yang, losing both his daughter and his property, was driven to madness. After ten days, Yang recently received a tip that Da-mei is having an affair with Yao Gen-fu (19 years old), a local tailor working at No. 12 Shengmu Yuan Road in the French Concession, and they are cohabitating in a tailor shop opened by Yao's relative, Ma Zhu-shi, at No. 3029 Shangnan Road, Yangsi Bridge, Pudong. Upon receiving this news, Yang was overjoyed and yesterday afternoon, personally went to the Yangsi Bridge Police Station in Pudong to file a complaint. Patrol Officer Xiao Jing-fu ordered the police to arrest both Yao and Da-mei and send them to the Tangqiao Police Station. After questioning by Station Chief Ju Jing, both confessed that they had repeatedly committed adultery for several days in the Taixin Inn in Xiaodongmen and in a friend's home in Liuliqiao, Pudong. All the jewelry had been used up. The Station Chief, considering that both the man and the woman had not reached the legal age, and therefore could not claim freedom of marriage, let alone fall in love first, immediately ordered that they be sent to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation in order to rectify public morals and set an example.</p>
<h3>Violent Debt Collection Conflict</h3>

Married women were generally not accepted, so the number of those admitted was small, which further increased financial difficulties. Recruitment has been temporarily suspended. Currently, 35 student police officers are needed, and the training institute has announced the recruitment examination.</p>

<h3>Cow Talk in the Year of the Ox</h3>
<p>— (Yao Chengxuan)</p>
<p>Don't despise it! Just imagine, the elixir of life that sustains us, vitamins, and the golden millet that continues our lives are all plowed out by that animal that has contributed to humanity for thousands of years, the ox, in the Year of the Ox, dragging the heavy iron plow. Labor is sacred, and the ox among animals is even more worthy of praise. This year is the Year of the Ox, and I hope everyone in the new year will think about the ox that gives us gifts without asking for anything in return, but instead hurts itself and cannot end its life well. At the same time, think about the contrast between humans, the spirit of all things who only consume and do not produce, can we not feel ashamed? Zhu Bailu's family motto says, "For every bowl of porridge and every grain of rice, we should think of where it comes from," which is really worth considering!</p>
<p>We must have the spirit of the ox, which is to bear heavy burdens and go far, to drive away all obstacles and monsters of demons and ghosts, which may be worth mentioning this year.</p>
<p>We know that the Egyptians worshiped animal gods. Legend has it that they believed that the spirit of the Nile River God, who bestowed great grace, was entrusted to the sacred cow, so they valued it very much and worshiped it devoutly. I am now quoting this classical meaning, not for anything else, but only to hope that we protect the animals that have contributed to mankind, do not kill them arbitrarily, and do not make them make unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<h3>Monk Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Sun Jingwen</p>
<p>I once heard an old lady say: "Changzhou is a Buddhist land, and the incense is very heavy." We all know that Changzhou's large temples, such as Tianning Temple and Qingliang Temple, are indeed very famous.</p>
<p>Our country is suffering from heavy oppression from the enemy, and has reached a very critical period. Citizens must be trained; although monks seem to be detached from the world, they are still in this world, so monks must also be trained. Recently, Changzhou has added a new type of monk soldier.</p>
<p>Every morning, many young and strong monks gather on the public sports field, marching in orderly steps, carrying guns, and with a heroic warrior spirit. When running, they shout: "One, one, one two three four." That is much more energetic than when they usually chant "Amitabha Buddha"! Their clothing is different from that of ordinary soldiers, with Boy Scout-style boat-shaped hats and gray jackets that look somewhat like suits.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I saw monk soldiers on the street, I looked at these many young and handsome young men wearing special military uniforms; if I hadn't heard people talking about monk soldiers, I would never have guessed that they were monks, even though their special military uniforms already had some resemblance to monks' robes.</p>
<p>Monks who are compassionate and do not kill, and who do not eat meat for life, must now learn how to kill people; I don't know if they can understand that the war for national survival and killing the enemy is truly saving all living beings!</p>
<h3>Clam Diggers</h3>
<p>— Fan Xianwei</p>
<p>The "clam digging" that I am writing about here, readers, please do not misunderstand, does not refer to the lewd actions of ordinary old customers towards prostitutes—taking the pulse, but rather, is the "iron rooster" of the "three books," really digging clams, this must be declared first.</p>
<p>For the sake of life's whipping, they do not hesitate to risk their lives to exchange for food, in the icy and snowy weather, they row a small boat, along the winding embankment, exposing a right arm, naked, immersed in the cold water,—dig,—feel,—although the ice on the side of the boat hangs down like crystal chopsticks, the warm, rough, black jade arms are frozen purple, but they don't care at all, as if their hands are immersed in hot noodle soup, they just feel for them one by one; sometimes the river water freezes into a sheet, they will even use iron hammers to break the ice, knock out a section, feel for a section, knock! feel! Goosebumps cover their entire body, and their upper and lower jaws chatter non-stop. Ordinary people probably can't stand it!</p>
<p>According to a group of old clam diggers, when they first start digging, their arms do feel like they are about to break, but after digging for a while, they don't feel anything! People who wear gloves will get frostbite, but we won't, there are only a few cracks, it's really unbelievable!</p>
<p>Speaking of clams, of course you have to think of frozen tofu and yellow green onions! These three things, like shoehorns and brushes,—a set of puffer fish, are appreciated by a group of gourmets. If you add a little pepper powder when eating, you won't let go even if you get slapped! And the price is very cheap, quite suitable for the common people, three liters of walnuts and four liters of shells, piled into a big pile of clam shells, but you can only get a thousand coins, life is really no more difficult!</p>
<h3>The Wardrobe Escape (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>The French Mother and Daughter's Heroic Deeds</p>
<p>The German soldier replied, "Madam, you can rest assured." As he spoke, the three of them had moved the wardrobe outside and onto the car. The roads in the countryside were rugged and uneven, so the car traveled with unusual bumps. Mrs. Fowler was curled up in the wardrobe, not even caring about the pain of the collisions. This time, passing through the hands of the German soldiers, she was not discovered, which can be regarded as heaven not condemning her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fowler had been lying in the wardrobe for a long time, and her health was greatly affected. At first, she had minor illnesses, which she managed to endure, but later her condition required medication. So, Mrs. Goff first approached a chemist in the village, determined that he was trustworthy, and then invited him to her home to treat Mrs. Fowler's illness. Mrs. Goff's care for Mrs. Fowler can be described as meticulous, and everyone in Belletri village who knew that the Goff family was hiding a British soldier kept their mouths shut, which can also be considered a miracle among miracles.</p>
<p>One day, it was heard that a batch of British prisoners of war had been brought to the village, so Mrs. Fowler and Mrs. Pascon quietly went out, prepared to pretend to be Belgian farmers if anyone questioned them. Mrs. Fowler talked to a fellow villager among the British prisoners of war and learned that there was hope that the war would end soon. One day in mid-October 1918, the whole village suddenly became agitated, and the German soldiers stationed in the village were coming and going, very busy, and had no time to care about the actions of the villagers. A German soldier said to Mrs. Goff: "We are leaving, the British soldiers are about to arrive." So, Mrs. Fowler, who had spent most of three years and nine months in the wardrobe, dared to go out. Her hair, scattered all over her head, had turned gray. Although she was often plagued by illness, because she had been looking forward day and night to the opportunity to escape, which suddenly arrived, she was greatly invigorated in her ecstasy.</p>
<p>The first British troops to enter the village were the Canadian cavalry, followed by the South African Scottish troops of the 66th Division. Mrs. Fowler, in a moment of confusion, joined the Scottish troops. A squad leader saw a strangely shaped person running towards the barracks, so he raised his rifle and aimed it at him. This is not surprising, because such a strange person could easily be suspected of being a spy or a deserter, so Mrs. Fowler was captured and a guard was sent to escort him to the regimental headquarters for disposal. At that time, Mrs. Goff and her daughter angrily argued with the squad leader, but although the two were eloquent, no one in the team could understand French and did not pay attention to what they were saying. Just as they were about to escort her away, Mrs. Fowler suddenly broke away from the guards and ran to the opposite street, begging an officer. That person was Major Delac, who had been a lieutenant in the 11th Hussars Regiment during the Battle of Le Gata in 1914 and was setting up a communications office at the time. After several years, he still recognized Mrs. Fowler. So, he ordered the escort to stop and wrote a note certifying Mrs. Fowler's resume. Mrs. Fowler was thus able to return to his regiment, and his commander granted him a month's leave to return home to recuperate. Before he set sail, he returned to Belletri village to say goodbye to Mrs. Goff and her daughter and Mrs. Pascon, and the kindness of his rebirth could not be expressed in words.</p>
<p>When I was a special correspondent for the Daily News in February 1927, I first heard Mrs. Goff personally talk about Mrs. Fowler's old story of the cavalry. Everything I saw when I first visited Mrs. Goff's residence in Belletri village remained in my mind forever. The wardrobe in which Mrs. Fowler had been hiding for nearly four years was still placed in the corner. Mrs. Goff trembled with both hands and held out the silver cup presented by the officers of the 11th Hussars Regiment to express their gratitude for rescuing the soldiers of the same regiment, and then took out the certificate and medal awarded by the British government and handed them to me for viewing. A very proud expression appeared on her face. What is touching is that at this time, Mrs. Goff's situation was bleak and gradually threatened by poverty. When the readers of the Daily News heard this news, they donated a sum of money as a lifetime annuity for Mrs. Goff and her daughter Angel. Other French women who had sheltered British soldiers also benefited from this. In April 1927, Mrs. Goff and her daughter were greeted by the public to London, where they received the certificate of annuity from the city government. A few days later, they were summoned by King George and Queen Mary at Windsor Palace. They all felt very honored, and their chivalry was truly worthy of the world's admiration.</p>
<h3>On "Fangzi"</h3>
<p>— Yu Fu</p>
<p>"Fangzi" is a place name. It is a small town within the boundary of Tancheng County in eastern Shandong, and also an important transportation hub along the Jiaoji Railway. Because of convenient transportation and abundant mineral resources, its commerce is very developed. However, what is heartbreaking is that there are many Japanese people here, and "white powder" is quite prevalent. Therefore, on the streets, one often sees faces sallow and skin emaciated, showing those poisoned by it! Next to the trash cans in various alleys, one can often see people wearing only a burlap sack, as their wandering companion. Seeing that hungry face is truly pitiful! Then, thinking about how they got there, I can't help but feel chilled to the bone!</p>
<p>Although the history of Fangzi began before the European War when Germans developed it and started mining coal, the power of a certain country's people is indeed very strong: with a consulate protecting them from above, and a chamber of commerce and financial groups below. Their businesses mostly focus on selling drugs, pawnshops, selling used clothes, rubber shoes, and rice. Among them, the sales volume of rubber shoes would make us astonished!</p>
<p>Fangzi has five roads, like five huge snakes that penetrate deep into the countryside (sucking them dry). There are no towering high-rise buildings there, but many very spacious Western-style bungalows. There are also no brightly lit dance halls, nor many cars speeding back and forth. However, on the streets, one often sees girls decked out in finery, and these girls are all goddesses who sell their bodies, and the price is extremely low, almost only needing one or two yuan to achieve the goal. However, the places for secret rendezvous are all attached to the drug-selling venues under the influence of a certain country's people.</p>
<p>The commercial center is on Sanma Road. From Yima Road to Sima Road, all are places for open and secret prostitution, gambling dens, and selling "white powder." If an unfamiliar guest with a "rustic" air arrives, they will also extend an impolite red arm to pull you in.</p>
<p>There are three elementary schools in the eastern part of Fangzi. Among them, the elementary school of a certain country is the most complete. The other two schools were founded by our people, but due to financial constraints, they mostly do not meet children's psychological needs, which is also a very regrettable thing.</p>
<p>Finally, let me say again, for the sake of reading the newspaper, I must go to Fangzi almost every day. I often see villagers nearby, constantly frequenting the shoe merchants of a certain country, but very few people patronizing Chinese shoe stores! This must be because "the goods of a certain country are cheaper," no doubt. Otherwise, why would Chinese people compete to buy them! In this way, Chinese stores are becoming increasingly declining, even unable to maintain themselves, while the people of a certain country are particularly active, with all sorts of tricks like big discounts... that are even more sufficient to deceive customers and put Chinese merchants to death! However, Fangzi has many miners, so solar rubber shoes have taken a step towards great success. It is said that a certain family can sell as many as 5,000 pairs in a month. Wouldn't such sales volumes astonish us!</p>
<h3>Replacing the Nest with Luan and Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10 (Silk Handkerchief Sends Intimate Thoughts, Strange Article Miscast; Yellow Flowers Facing Withered, Autumn Letter Adds Sorrow)</p>
<p>But after waiting for two days, there was no news. On the morning of the first day, the school sent another notice, calling for a school affairs meeting to discuss improvements to school affairs for the next semester. Guoqi was an important teacher at the school and had to go. It was so coincidental that he went out and Youmei came. Today, Youmei came in, not as bold as usual, quietly entering the door and standing in the courtyard for a moment. Seeing Aunt Liu, she smiled softly and asked, "Has the old lady gone out today?" As she spoke, her apple-like round face had two large round blushes. Aunt Liu said, "Our old lady rarely goes out, she's at home." Only then did Youmei slowly walk to the door of Zhang's eldest son's room and peeked inside. Old Mrs. Zhang was sitting on a bamboo chair, slowly folding a stack of white handkerchiefs on her lap. She smiled and said, "Miss Li, you've come. I was just thinking about you." Youmei's heart skipped a beat. Why was this old lady thinking about me? She smiled and said, "I come often, am I disturbing you, old lady?" Old Mrs. Zhang smiled and said, "When you come, chatting and laughing, it's just right to keep me company. How could it be a disturbance? Please sit down." As she spoke, she got up to offer a seat, taking the handkerchiefs to the closet. Youmei said, "You're very clean, old lady. You've even prepared so many handkerchiefs." Old Mrs. Zhang smiled and said, "These aren't mine. These are what I prepared for Guoqi. In this hot weather, he should always have a few more handkerchiefs to wipe his sweat. He's a bookworm. He doesn't care about anything except the things in his books. I can only prepare them for him." Youmei smiled and said, "Aunt, what you said is exactly the opposite. Do you think Cousin is a bookworm? He's extremely careful in everything he does. Only the books on his bookshelf are arranged neatly, without leaning even a bit. The pens, ink, and trinkets on his desk, there's not one that isn't exquisite. My temperament is just that I like things to be neat. I really want to learn his carefulness." Old Mrs. Zhang smiled and said, "You still say that, but his skill is still in books. I'm idle at home, so I might as well take care of some things for him." As she said this, Aunt Liu brought a bowl of tea, offering it to Youmei with both hands, and smiled, "I always say this, our teacher should quickly marry a capable young mistress. First, the old lady would have company. Second, the old lady wouldn't have to worry about these things anymore." Youmei took the teacup, only looking into the teacup, seemingly thinking about something, and didn't pay attention to Aunt Liu's words. Seeing her like this, Old Mrs. Zhang exchanged a look with Aunt Liu, signaling her not to say more. Naturally, Aunt Liu left with a smile. (122)</p>
<p>Local Customs Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Class Meeting in Japanese Schools</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>When Japanese schools hold class meetings, they always have a big feast, which is definitely not as monotonous as our country's student union, with only reports and discussions. At the simplest, they arrange the desks in a circle in the classroom and eat some tea, snacks, and fruit. Usually, everyone has to pay one or two yuan to have dinner at the cafeteria or restaurant. Outside the restaurant, a sign of a certain school's class meeting is hung, just like a banquet.</p>
<p>Several young maids put a few simple and exquisite Japanese dishes in front of everyone, followed by many bottles of Japanese sake. The class meeting committee members stood up and reported the reasons for the meeting and the preparation process. After a round of applause, they began to gobble it up. The students toasted each other with copper-sized sake cups, either celebrating passing the exam or wishing good health. A few small bottles of Japanese sake were not enough for a few toasts, so they went to the students who didn't drink to beg for sake. In less than half an hour, the wine and dishes were all gone. Then they started singing, hitting the plates with chopsticks and singing wildly in turns. When Chinese people sing in Qing Dynasty style at banquets, they have to be polite a few times, pretending to be half-pushing and half-yielding. They, however, recommended themselves one after another. Although the sound of a screeching cat and the blue veins in their necks were terribly swollen, they still refused to stop. From popular folk love songs to solemn and quiet school songs, it was truly a grand sight. Japanese students, no matter who they are, can do a few things when it comes to smoking, drinking, singing, and dancing, and their enthusiasm is really good.</p>
<p>A few cups of Japanese sake had already burned their faces red. Tying towels on their heads, a few people gathered in a pile, jumping and dancing wildly, performing Japanese dances. Tables and sake cups were overturned, and students and maids were twisted together. Only laughter and shouts filled the room. A photographer came to take a commemorative photo of the class meeting. Everyone had to temporarily stop the fun and sit quietly. A few maids also insisted on taking photos together, so you embraced me, fighting to mess around with the maids. The photographer had no choice but to wait patiently until the struggle was settled.</p>
<p>After the photography was completed, they continued to fool around. The tables were littered with cups and plates, and there were no more dishes to eat with the rice. They were unwilling to spend more money, so they poured some cold soup on the white rice and finished the meal. Those who wanted to drink had spilled the bottles, leaving nothing. Even if there was a cup, it was mischievously mixed with tea and soy sauce. The maids frowned, tidying up their clothes and hairstyles, looking very troubled, which was very different from their smiling welcome when they entered the room. The students' actions had all learned the style of gentlemen, but they were indeed embarrassing to the maids and prostitutes.</p>
<p>After shouting "Long live a certain school," everyone prepared to scatter like birds and beasts. The maids breathed a sigh of relief, lowered their heads, and thanked them. A student took a flower from the table and walked away. Then, small flower vases, cigarette boxes, glass cups, and sake cups all disappeared without a trace. A student took a small sake cup, made a face at the student next to him, and threw it into his bag.</p>
<p>In twos and threes, the students walked staggeringly on the hot and bustling street, Tomorrow, the newspaper will publish that a certain school's students were drunk and fought with the police and were criminally punished. The dancing, singing, and reveling Japanese students, and the Chinese students standing in the gale and heavy snow soliciting donations to aid Suiyuan, contrast each other. I can't help but secretly say, "They are worthy of being students in a time of national crisis."</p>

<h3>Contributing Thoughts on the Future of National Goods in the Twenty-Sixth Year</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>In the national goods sector of the twenty-fifth year, following the implementation of the legal tender and during a year of abundant harvests in various regions, the price index and the cost of living simultaneously increased, and the production index of industry also showed improvement. The national goods sector has felt the signs of things taking a turn for the better, and everyone is delighted, believing that the future of national goods will have endless hope from now on. At the same time, the government's active promotion and society's enthusiastic use all gave the progress of national goods unparalleled excitement. Now that everything is renewed at the beginning of the year, and the seasons are refreshed, we have entered the twenty-sixth year. What will be the future of national goods in the twenty-sixth year? Please state the general situation and attach some hopes.</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year, what the national goods sector will first show the country as an example of progress is the consistent adoption of national goods by government agencies and the consistent use of national goods by civil servants nationwide. Therefore, the Shanghai national goods sector intends to make this year the "Civil Servant National Goods Year," which is based on the idea that civil servants are the role models for the people, and that they are more enthusiastic about loving the country and using national goods, since they eat the country's salary and do the country's affairs on a daily basis. Therefore, it places unlimited hope on them. Moreover, since the Ministry of Industry has already established measures for government agencies to use national goods, those who implement them should be strict and conscientious, and should not be negligent in the slightest. If they should lose their conscience and use inferior goods to pass off as national goods, their integrity will be lost once discovered. The measures stipulate that expenditures that are not economical will not be reimbursed, and the responsibility for compensation will be borne by the responsible party, which should be noted as the first point.</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year, the National General Economic Construction Movement Association will begin to prepare for the establishment of a National Goods Joint Operating Company to implement the national goods network plan. From now on, there will be institutions for buying and selling national goods in all cities, counties, townships, and towns across the country. Manufactured products from cities will be sold domestically, and raw materials and handicrafts from rural areas will be transported externally. The network will be interconnected, and national products will become popular. The spirit of official-private cooperation will bring about the effect of the whole country following suit, which is especially gratifying as the second point.</p>
<p>What the Chinese national goods sector needs most in the twenty-sixth year is a large-scale connection of the national goods movement across the country. The Women's National Goods Usage Association is responsible for connecting women across the country, and the national goods promotion associations and national goods usage associations in various regions should carry out the same steps under the same goal, sincerely and practically seeking a way out for national goods, which is to reduce trade deficits and recover lost income. It is hoped that this year, they will communicate more with each other, so as to achieve practical results in promotion, which should be earnestly carried out as the third point.</p>
<p>I dare to offer my humble opinions to the people of the country at the beginning of the year with unlimited expectations.</p>
<h3>New Year and National Goods</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Time flies, and the "Citizen National Goods Year" of the Republic of China's twenty-fifth year has now flown away with the flowing time. The new year - the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China - has begun to unfold before us. While this New Year of the twenty-sixth year has not yet completely passed, the author takes this opportunity to contribute some opinions on promoting national goods for discussion with patriotic comrades.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "The plan of a day lies in the morning, and the plan of a year lies in the spring." This New Year is precisely the time for us to determine the plan for the year. All aspects of academic improvement, moral cultivation, physical exercise, etc., need to be determined at the beginning of the year, and then implemented in order, so that considerable results can be achieved.</p>
<p>Let's take this year's national goods promotion movement as an example! At this New Year, we also need to determine a promotion plan. For example, on a personal level, how will I do my best to use national goods, promote national goods, and persuade relatives and friends to believe in national goods and purchase national goods during this year? All of these are what we should make a plan for at this New Year, and strive to do with a consistent spirit.</p>
<p>Also, national goods organizations, national goods factories, national goods merchants, and various schools and families should also determine a national goods promotion plan at this New Year. I hope that in terms of planning, it does not have to be very detailed, but it should be earnestly promoted. Politicians say: "Governance does not lie in many words, but in practice." Our national goods promotion movement does not require empty talk, but only requires everyone to earnestly promote it, and naturally it will achieve great results.</p>
<p>The time of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China has begun to turn. The author respectfully offers the above humble opinions to all readers with the utmost sincerity, hoping that everyone will start from the New Year and do more practical and effective work for the national goods movement.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Movement in Various Ports of the Yangtze River (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yun Xun</p>
<p>Lu Lihua, the principal of the Shanghai Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School, in addition to dedicating her life to the cause of women's physical education, also holds the most ardent and sincere aspirations for the national goods movement. She recently traveled to various ports along the Yangtze River. The main purpose was naturally to investigate the service status of students from her school in various places. The secondary mission, however, was entrusted to her by the Shanghai National Goods Movement Federation to actually stir up a surge of attention to national goods in those provinces! Lasting four weeks, passing through the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, although it was a fleeting visit, it was still quite fruitful. Ms. Lu had just taken off the dust of her journey, and was busy with public and private affairs. The writer was granted an interview with her and had a thirty-minute conversation. The content was limited to national goods, and I would like to introduce it as follows.</p>
<p>Wuhu The first port, Wuhu, she believes that Wuhu has the advantage of water and land transportation, with Yangtze River ships and the Jiangnan Railway. It is an important commercial port in southern Anhui and can be said to be the hub for exporting Anhui's local products to other provinces. The promotion of national goods in Wuhu can be said to have just sprouted. A street of national goods market is not very large and was not established in accordance with the company organization law. It is still an old-fashioned shareholding system. What is awakening Chinese people to use national goods is a dedicated National Goods Road, about 50 meters long, which can be imitated in various places, and it is not without enlightenment to the general public! There are also national goods publications. After Ms. Lu arrived in Wuhu, Commissioner Gao Wenbo of the Commissioner's Office convened a meeting to establish a preparatory committee for the Wuhu All-Circles National Goods Promotion Federation. After this exchange of information, a connection was established between Shanghai and Wuhu. It is expected that as long as Shanghai takes the lead in promotion, they will rise up to respond. Anqing The commercial situation is inferior to Wuhu. There was no organization for the national goods movement in advance. After Ms. Lu arrived in the province, the Anhui Provincial Party Department convened various public groups to establish a preparatory committee for the Anhui All-Circles National Goods Promotion Federation. There is no large-scale national goods market there, but perhaps there are similar small organizations. Ms. Lu only stayed for one night. She hopes that the provincial authorities will promote the national goods movement to various counties and pay attention to the use of national goods in important events, because cities and villages only have the strongest purchasing power during weddings, funerals, and celebrations.</p>
<p>Jiujiang Jiujiang is an ordinary city. There is the Jiujiang National Goods Movement Promotion Association, located in the Jiujiang Chamber of Commerce. Its mission is to promote the use of national goods, assist national goods manufacturers in improving production, assist national goods manufacturers in promoting national goods, collect national goods for display and exhibition, participate in national goods competitions in various places, and safeguard the legal rights of national goods manufacturers. Other tasks include national goods publicity, national goods investigation, and national goods certification. The association has two types of members: individual members and factory/store members. The association's affairs are currently presided over by Lin Bingzhou, who is the brigade commander of the First Independent Brigade of the Marine Corps. He is personally very hardworking, but the local area lacks unity. Lin is preparing to establish contact with Shanghai's national goods industrial and commercial groups, so that the future of national goods will gradually expand.</p>

<h3>National Goods Renewal Year</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>The ancients said: "If you want to see a thousand miles, go up another floor." I say that the progress of national goods is also the same. The national goods promotion movement for more than ten years has been in research and evolution every day, starting from naming the National Goods Year, followed by the Women's National Goods Year, the Students' National Goods Year, and the Citizens' National Goods Year. The foundation of national goods is solid. The front line of national goods is strong and progressing day by day, and time flies by in an instant, and the beginning of the "Civil Servants' National Goods Year" has begun. It is expected that after the revival of rural areas and the prosperity of the market, there will be a brighter, more splendid, and more vibrant new record of national goods enterprises, "If you want to see a thousand miles, there is only the joy of national goods!" The writer respectfully wishes this year to be a "National Goods Renewal Year."</p>

<p>Talking Point</p>
<h3>Soaring Newspaper Prices</h3>
<p>— Zi Nan</p>
<p>Because of the underdevelopment of industry, China's commodity prices have always been manipulated by foreigners. When a certain country can dominate, it dominates. When another country invades, competition arises. As a result of the competition, Chinese buyers get a small bargain for a while, but it is very temporary. Soon after, either the competitors compromise with each other, or it returns to unity, and the Chinese still drink sour vinegar with their noses pinched and become dumb people eating coptis chinensis.</p>
<p>There are too many such examples. Closer to us, there was the "kerosene war" not long ago. Recently, because of the lack of goods from various places, newspaper prices have soared again.</p>
<p>The source of newspapers: "Ten years ago, most of the newspapers sold by Chinese people came from Sweden and Norway; since Canadian newspapers were imported for dumping, the goods of Sweden and Norway have gradually decreased in imports. Three years ago, because German commercial banks received subsidies from the German government, they also shipped newspapers to China for dumping, so they competed with each other, and prices only fell and did not rise." In such a situation of "only falling and not rising," China finally temporarily used some cheap goods. "Now, Canadian newspapers have not been imported from June to December for half a year. When we inquire about the reason, we found that the Eastern neighbor Japan has contracted them for half a year. The wood pulp paper produced by the paper mills there has all been converted to Japan for military supplies; it is also heard that the Canadian paper mills are unable to supply enough newspapers to the United States and will not be able to ship them to Asia for promotion. European newspapers, since the wood pulp has been used for military purposes, the paper production has also decreased. At present, Europe itself has a great shortage of newspapers, and the recent goods have been sold out by various factories. Future goods will not be produced until after October next year, but the quantity is limited and not very large. From this point of view, the price of newsprint may continue to rise."</p>
<p>In this voice of "possible continued rise," we really have no time to lament the transformation of cultural tools into murderous military supplies. And according to people in the paper industry: "If European and American newspapers really reduce imports in the future and cannot only supply the needs of our people, then Eastern goods newspapers may repeatedly come from the Yalu River... It is said that if the selling price of newspapers rises by two or three cents per ream, and the actual selling price is five yuan and two or three cents, then the Tianzhang Transparent Paper Factory in this city intends to add newsprint, because newspaper raw materials can replace wood pulp with straw, rags, and paper scraps. In the past, the factory had successfully tried to manufacture it, but it stopped manufacturing due to cost reasons and inability to compete with foreign goods. Recently, the selling price has gradually increased. If there is profit to be made, it should restore the old view, implement the original intention, and conform to the purpose of saving the country through industry."</p>
<p>Because of the lack of sources, national goods newspapers have a chance to emerge, which cannot but be said to be "a blessing in disguise." But we must not be too happy. First, this "addition" must wait for the "two or three cents increase," otherwise it may still be "unable to compete with foreign goods"; second, that belongs to the future, but the problem is even greater, that is, what will happen if Canadian or German newspapers come to dump again in the future? Their newspapers have sold for three yuan a ream.</p>
<p>Comparing three yuan and five yuan two or three cents, the numbers differ by nearly double, but China's paper industry must wait until five yuan two or three cents to "make a profit." Without thinking carefully, it really makes us worry. If we cannot improve the product and reduce costs in this only opportunity, not to mention waiting for others to dump, even if the needs of all parties decline, our products will still be unsalable.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current problem is not limited to this. When European and American newspapers reduce imports, Eastern goods newspapers will repeatedly come from the Yalu River!</p>
<p>To manufacture large quantities of newspapers, straw, rags, and paper scraps to replace wood pulp are obviously not enough. Newspaper raw materials must also have vast forests, and speaking of forests, one cannot help but think of the Northeast.</p>
<p>The rise and establishment of China's national industry cannot be separated from the entire fate of China.</p>
<h3>Missionaries</h3>
<p>— Shih Dai</p>
<p>Hong Kong Sketches</p>
<p>Unknowingly, I developed a habit. Every time I come back from climbing the mountain and pass through Camp Road, I always go to the park on the hillside to rest for a while. Here are bright flowers and plants, and lush green coconut trees; there are couples holding each other (they are all blue-eyed), and red-headed Indian guards with full beards; there are also groups of children of different races, playing on seesaws, turning sand and soil. The happy and lively atmosphere fills the entire park, which will quickly make people forget their excessive fatigue.</p>
<p>Alone, I ran under the fir trees, quietly reading a novel. I don't know why, but once my heart is calm, I can clearly hear the gurgling spring of the mountain stream, attracting me like music. So, I closed the book, leaned against the tree trunk, listened intently to the sound of the spring, and sometimes stared blankly at the sails on the sea to the north, drifting in the scene where the sky and the water are the same color.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of laughter rushed over from behind, startling me and turning around. It turned out to be a female missionary in black clothes and a white hat, surrounded by a group of half-grown children. They stood on that flat green grass. The female missionary patiently explained "God" to them. The children listened obediently, looking very much like a shepherd girl standing in a flock of sheep. Driven by curiosity, I also ran over there to hear what she was saying. She didn't notice me at all, and naturally wasn't surprised by my sudden arrival. She was a young girl, with a delicate white face hidden under her white hat, and long, thick eyelashes constantly fluttering under her white gold-rimmed glasses. Her lips never stopped working, and the fluent Cantonese simply couldn't make me believe she was "Anglo-Saxon."</p>
<p>"God is watching you at all times. Your sins cannot be hidden from God! You are all good children! Be obedient, believe in God, and listen to God's instructions!..."</p>
<p>The lamb-like children were all Chinese. No, I also saw two Indians among them. They all looked up with innocent faces. They had no doubts or fears. Obviously, they were used to seeing such foreigners and hearing such words.</p>
<p>"Chinese and Indians like to commit crimes the most! You must believe in God, be honest and sincere, and don't fight back when others hit you, that's their own sin! You will go to hell after death! God is extremely fair, he sends criminals to hell to be punished, and takes those who do good to heaven to enjoy happiness and joy! You must listen to God's words, don't be barbaric!..."</p>
<p>A student-like child suddenly asked:</p>
<p>"The British also commit crimes! They often beat Chinese and Indians. Yesterday, a Chinese beggar was kicked to death by a British soldier in the street! Isn't that a crime? Isn't that barbaric? Why doesn't God punish him? Chinese and Indians never dare to beat foreigners, but foreigners bully Chinese and Indians at every turn. Why doesn't God care? And you say God is fair?"</p>
<p>She immediately went to hug the head of that half-grown child and kissed his cheeks kindly:</p>
<p>"Lovely child! That is God's will. That beggar must have committed an unforgivable sin, so God wants to punish him and let that kind British man punish him. Although he is dead, his sins have been redeemed! He can go to heaven, I bless him (making the sign of the cross in front of her)." Remember not to commit crimes yourself: don't offend God!"</p>
<p>Then she took out a bag of candy and distributed it to the children to eat. She asked with a smile:</p>
<p>"Is the candy delicious?"</p>
<p>"Delicious!" the children replied.</p>
<p>"This is given to you by God! Believing in God means you will always have candy to eat!"</p>
<p>I left there with anger and returned to where I was sitting. There were more and more people in the park. Malays were whistling, following behind foreign sailors. Thinking of that missionary scene, foreign aggression has precise and concrete plans. They use various methods to bully Chinese people, oppress colonies, and even use numbing methods to prevent the slaves of the colonies from awakening!</p>
<h3>Thousand Buddha Mountain</h3>
<p>— Ma Feng</p>
<p>When I was little, every first day of the Lunar New Year, I would always put on new clothes, pay New Year's greetings, get some "lucky money," and go to Baotu Spring Bazaar to have fun, buying some foreign eggplants, wooden knives, wooden guns, ghost masks... and go home. At that time, I could hear the "fortune tellers" drawing bamboo sticks and shouting:</p>
<p>"Number one stick comes with a bow, Xue Rengui in white robe goes to conquer the East!"</p>
<p>"Number nine stick comes on the ninth day of the ninth month, go to Thousand Buddha Mountain to drink wine: you bring the wine and I bring the dishes, salted duck eggs from Nanyang Lake!"</p>
<p>Now I can't hear this shouting anymore. The "stall vendors" are also nowhere to be seen. However, on the ninth day of the ninth month, the event of "going to Thousand Buddha Mountain to drink wine" still exists in Jinan; and it is regarded as a grand festival.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the South Walled City, Thousand Buddha Mountain comes into view. To its east and west, many mountains rise and fall, the one with a name being Jue Mountain to the east. On top of Jue Mountain is a tower in the shape of a peg, said to be the place where boats were tied, and the entire city of Jinan is a boat; thinking about it, it's quite interesting. Lines of pack donkeys are tied to the trees by the roadside, lowering their heads silently waiting for their masters to find customers for them. The people visiting the mountain are so crowded that they can't even catch their breath. The shouting of adults, the crying of children, laughter, the shouts of vendors, are intertwined into large waves filling the pervasive dust. The crowd is rolling like sea waves; in that wave of people where it's hard to tell who is who, you can only clearly see the black and white hats of the police, and their hands raised to hit people.</p>
<p>The road to the mountain winds like a yellow ribbon. On both sides of the road are piled up stalls of vendors, and among these vendors, the ones with the best business are those selling "lotus persimmons." Persimmons are a specialty in Shandong, and "lotus persimmons" are the most famous among persimmons. People go to Thousand Buddha Mountain on the Double Ninth Festival almost to buy them. People say, -</p>
<p>"Go up the mountain to buy lotus persimmons, go down the mountain to buy capped persimmons."</p>
<p>You can understand it with a little thought. People returning from Thousand Buddha Mountain all carry large baskets of lotus persimmons, like tying crabs, one next to the other. The price is also cheap, six or seven cents can buy ten, and giving them as gifts is a good thing.</p>
<p>There are many teahouses along the way, almost all of which also sell silver foil, yellow paper, incense and other items for worshiping gods. There are also quite a few people who come to the mountain to fulfill their vows.</p>
<p>On the west road to the mountain, near the temple, there is a wooden archway painted in vermilion, with the words "Nine Points of Qi Smoke" inscribed on it. There's naturally nothing to see in these four words - look back: there are nine black stars protruding and undulating around the city of Jinan, those are mountains one after another.</p>
<p>On this day of the Double Ninth Festival, the incense in the temple is very prosperous. As soon as you enter the temple, the smoke fills the air, making people feel uncomfortable. Many Buddha statues are carved on the mountain walls in the courtyard. The name "Thousand Buddha Mountain" comes from this. In the Buddha hall in the backyard, a certain "Grandma" is enshrined, and many women burn incense there. There are even clay dolls with red strings in the Buddha hall! - Do you know what this is?</p>
<p>"Tying dolls!"</p>
<p>Generally, superstitious people often do this to pray for offspring. I don't know how it works, but the women who go to "tie dolls" always do it secretly, and the "dolls" they "tie" are also secretly collected and taken home!</p>
<p>Almost all the people who go up the mountain go back without reaching the top. Do they know that the beauty of "Thousand Buddha Mountain" is all at the top of the mountain! - At the top of the mountain, in addition to seeing the "Nine Points of Qi Smoke" more clearly; you can also see the Yellow River, which is forty miles away, appearing brightly like a yellow ribbon; the Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge lies horizontally on the river like a large black centipede. The entire city of Jinan is like an iron hoop rolled by children, lying quietly there! The people going up and down the mountain are like ants crawling.</p>
<p>In the past: Thousand Buddha Mountain on the Double Ninth Festival was a place for restless young lads and girls to "flirt". What about now? Thousand Buddha Mountain is a place for those young students and misses to talk about love.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai Poor People's Shelter (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Li Caihua</p>
<p>"Then what is their daily life like?"</p>
<p>"Their lives are very regular. After entering the shelter, we divide the thirteen people into a class, with one class leader per class (elected by themselves) to handle all their daily affairs. There are three meals a day, two congees and one rice, one dish per person. Breakfast is at 6:00 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, and dinner at 5:00 PM. During meal times, the class leader takes care of them to eat in the original place, without tables or chairs. At ordinary times they are given education, and children also go to class to read at fixed times."</p>
<p>"What kind of occupations do most of the poor people in your shelter have? Which province has the most people?"</p>
<p>"Most of them are odd-job workers and homeless beggars. As for their place of origin, Zhejiang and Hunan provinces have the most people."</p>
<p>"How is your shelter organized? Are there any medical facilities?"</p>
<p>"Our shelter is organized into five groups: General Affairs, Documentation, Management, Registration, and Hygiene. Most of the service personnel in each group are volunteers. As for whether there are medical facilities, we have simple medicines. If there are patients, they are immediately isolated, and seriously ill patients are sent to the hospital. Doctors from Shanghai Hospital come to the shelter to diagnose patients every day. In case of death, they are sent to Fu Yuan Tang. This year, there have been more than thirty patients, mostly suffering from fever and cold, and about three or four deaths."</p>
<p>At this point in the conversation, Mr. Chen was busy dealing with other matters, so he asked him to introduce a poor person for a conversation.</p>
<p>On the way back, I thought about three questions:</p>
<p>First, during the three to four months of shelter, some productive work could be given to them. On the one hand, it would increase the shelter's expenses, and on the other hand, it would cultivate their habit of self-reliance. At the same time, it would also enable them to acquire a productive skill. Passive relief is not as effective as active relief.</p>
<p>Second, when poor people enter the shelter, they should ask a doctor to examine their bodies, and those with toxic habits should be sent to smoking cessation hospitals, and those who are sick should be isolated and treated according to the type of disease.</p>
<p>Third, so many people living together without a large number of doors and windows, the turbid air inside cannot communicate with the fresh air outside. I think it is extremely easy to cause disease. In addition to installing more windows, they should be taken out for walks once or twice a day. (End)</p>

The Han dynasty declined and the world was in chaos. The bandits in all directions showed their heroism. Cao Mengde occupied Xu Du. Liu Biao was still in Xiangyang. The heroes of the world were all separated. The wandering emperor wandered east and west. When the wind and clouds met, they separated and reunited. Good generals and wise rulers scattered and reunited. Supported the endangered lord. Saved the trapped dragon. Who dared to fight at Dangyang. Wisely captured Guiyang and met the governor. Tender hands respectfully presented a cup. He would never agree to that kind of great righteousness. Zhou Lang also used the beauty trap. The brocade bag had three wonderful plans sealed in it. Deeply entered the dragon's pond and tiger's den. The Lord of Wu falsely declared that the Queen Mother was sick. Sun Madam mistakenly believed and returned to Jiangdong. Seized the main power of the Yangtze River and made great achievements. First Master's camp was seven hundred miles long. Lu Xun's clever plan burned it all. Relying on the general to escort him to Yong'an Palace. The emperor was ill and entrusted him. He always remembered the grace of meeting him. The Prime Minister made his first memorial. He was still a pioneer when he was old and strong. He beheaded five generals of the Han family. His sideburns were sparse, but he still showed his old majesty. There are few generals who have a complete body throughout the ages. Who can compare with his boldness. To this day, his heroic spirit still fills the sky.</p>

<h3>Afternotes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications (1300) will invite Mr. Chen Hui to teach singing from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM today.</p>
<p>In order to make it easier for the audience to understand the meaning of the songs, the Youth Choir has given away movie songs. However, due to the excessive number of requesters, most of the scores have already been given away, so those who came later were inevitably disappointed. The group deeply apologizes for this. It is heard that the group has recently obtained the consent of Xinhua Film Company to continue to distribute the interlude "拉犂歌 (Plowing Song)" from the company's best-selling film of this year, "壮志凌云 (Soaring Ambitions)". If those in all circles still want to request it, please attach a postage stamp of one cent (two cents for outside the city, and based on location for overseas). Send the letter to the group at No. 31, Lane 597, Wen Jian Shi Road, Shanghai, and it will be sent to you. However, because the number is limited, it is hoped that requesters will do so as soon as possible to avoid missing out.</p>
<p>The Da Hu Society, organized by young musicians in this city, held its inaugural meeting at No. 851 Beijing Road the other day. Li Yamin was elected as the temporary chairman, and Luo Ming recorded the meeting. They discussed the affairs of the society and elected Wang Hua and Li Yamin as the presidents, Sun Jiyuan as the chief accountant, Luo Ming as the chief documenter, and Wang Hong, Zhao Ping, Liu Yiming, and Tian Guang as directors, each responsible for carrying out all the affairs of the society. The society has Miss Xue Fei Qingying Yan Ying Xia Jun Yan Fei Jingying and other young ladies who are skilled in singing. It is heard that the society is now seeking members and has a charter available. Write for one (attach two cent postage stamp) to receive it.</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<h3>Behind the Scenes at Lianhua Studio</h3>
<p>In "A Match Made in Heaven," Han Lagen's father, mother, and son, three generations, are all on camera. Han's parents' expressions are sometimes sad and sometimes happy, which is of course Han's old-fashioned humor. Han's son is also naturally lively, worthy of being the son of a general.</p>
<p>In "A Match Made in Heaven," Han Lagen and Bai Lu swing on a swing. While swinging, Han repeatedly kisses Bai Lu, taking advantage of her, and Bai Lu wants to avoid him but cannot, suffering a considerable loss.</p>
<p>For the exterior scenes in "Spring Comes to the World," Sun Yu led a group of more than ten people, including Chen Yanyan, Mei Xi, Han Lagen, and Liu Jiqun, to Hangzhou to work for a week. They have all finished filming and returned, all full of spring breeze, with joy overflowing from their brows.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan in "Spring Comes to the World" is even more brilliant in her acting than in "Lonely City Heroine," and has made significant progress in her art.</p>
<p>In "The General's Daughter," Li Zhuozhuo, together with Li Qingtu, broke out of the tiger's den, jumped from the roof and straddled a horse, galloping away, acting with the flavor of an ancient female knight.</p>
<h3>Newcomer Xie Jun</h3>
<p>In Two New Films</p>
<p>Xie Jun, when he first joined Star, was called "Xie Jingbo." Later, Hong Shen renamed him Xie Jun, but his original name was "Xie Tian." The name "Xie Tian" is well-known in the comics world, and his comics are very beautiful. "Star Biweekly" often publishes comics by "Xie Tian."</p>
<p>His debut work "Night Meeting" made him stand out. After that, in the two films "Shared Hearts in Life and Death" and "Qingming Season," although he didn't have many scenes, he played them all very well.</p>
<p>Looking at his comic works, we believe that he has a lively artistic soul, which of course makes his future even more assured.</p>
<p>In the recent two new films "New Year's Money" and "Eternal Smile," his performance is particularly gratifying. In "New Year's Money," he played a poor father disguised as a garbage-picking child. As for "Eternal Smile," he played a lawyer who speaks eloquently in court for justice.</p>
<p>Today, the Wenwu Kunyi Opera Troupe will perform at the Empire Theater</p>
<p>Han Shichang and Bai Yunsheng will perform a scene from "Qintiao" together.</p>
<h3>"Flexible Daughter" Movie Snippets</h3>
<p>Lu Ming can't pay back the money she borrowed from Qin Tong, and her life of embracing is very miserable. Household expenses cannot be avoided, which makes her face full of sorrow.</p>
<p>As Xu Su Ling strolled near the New Metropolitan Ballroom, she was intentionally hit and injured by Xiao Dou Luan Ma Loufen driving from behind. The purpose of revenge was completely out of jealousy.</p>
<p>Zhu Qiuhen is depressed and sick, and has no strength to treat it. Fortunately, Yu Guang, a confidant in the dust, helped her to the Xihu Sanatorium for conditioning.</p>
<p>Since this year, Yihua plans to intensify its film production plan. Therefore, the original two studios are not enough, so it recently allocated 10,000 yuan to build another studio, which was completed auspiciously on New Year's Day. The great scenes in Chen Kengran's "Flexible Daughter" will continue to be filmed in this new venue.</p>
<h3>"Smile's" Screening News</h3>
<p>The new Star film "Eternal Smile" is directed by Wu Cun, written by Liu Na'ou, and stars Hu Die, Gong Jianong, Gong Qiuxia, Wang Xianzhai, and Shu Xiuwen. The whole film is beautiful and vivid, writing about the ups and downs of a song girl in Qinhuai. Under the director's meticulous and urgent handling, it is moving to tears. This film will be released at the Jincheng Grand Theater starting on the 15th of this month.</p>

<h3>New 1937 Dodge Car to Be Exhibited Soon</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Dodge products are known worldwide for their safety and reliability. The new 1937 Dodge car has been designed and built with meticulous care by a team of expert engineers, based on years of experience. Therefore, in addition to retaining all the advantages of the traditional Dodge, its improved streamlined design enhances its appearance, making it exceptionally appealing. As for the interior, the power and efficiency have been significantly improved. The spaciousness and comfort of the car body, as well as the safety and reliability of driving, all surpass previous models. Although the new Dodge is, in fact, an absolutely economical and affordable car, its value is not only unmatched by similar cars but also comparable to other mid-priced cars. The reason for this is simply that it excels in every aspect, making it the best in its class. It is said that with such a brand-new appearance and so many special features, the new Dodge car is sure to be warmly welcomed and enjoyed by the general public in the automotive market. This can be asserted with confidence.</p>
<p>The new cars are divided into two major series: the Dodge Six-Cylinder and the Dodge DeLuxe Six-Cylinder. These new cars have been shipped to Shanghai by the sole agent for Central China, the China Motor Company on Jing'an Temple Road in this city. They are currently actively engaged in the assembly of the new cars and all the preparatory work, so that they can be displayed to the public at the company's showroom from the 15th to the 17th of this month for three days, to make their first appearance to the people of Shanghai. At that time, the automotive industry in this city will surely be greatly stirred, with people rushing to be the first to see them. Therefore, before the official exhibition, a brief description of the general situation is given below for the reference of those who love the new Dodge car.</p>
<p>The body of the new Dodge car is made of a single piece of steel, and the roof is also an integral part of this all-steel structure, making it exceptionally strong and solid. The doors and windows are equipped with drip edges, which are convenient for driving in the rain. The center of the new car's radiator grille is decorated with chrome-plated parallel lines, making it more elegant and magnificent. As for the body, its front and rear lines are extremely beautiful and pleasing to the eye, making its appearance magnificent and unparalleled by ordinary vehicles. The new car doors are widened for easier entry and exit. The seats are as high as armchairs and have been widened, with the front seat measuring 47 inches and the rear seat reaching 48.5 inches. The interior is spacious enough to accommodate six people comfortably. The top of the front seat back is equipped with a sponge-rubber-filled safety roller to protect rear passengers, especially young children, from bumping hazards in the event of a sudden stop. In addition, due to the use of a special rear axle, the floor area of the rear compartment is completely flat, without any unevenness. The rear window is divided, and the dome light is mounted on it.</p>
<p>Regarding safety, the new car has numerous advantages. Let's briefly mention the following: the instrument panel on the new car is not only novel and beautiful in style, but also extremely safe, as there are no protruding spherical objects or buttons on it. Even the ignition key is now hidden and completely flush with the entire surface of the instrument panel. The all-steel safety body is now mounted on rubber-padded frame supports, so the disadvantages of metal-to-metal contact have been completely avoided. As for the absolute balance of weight distribution and the harmonic spring system, their contribution to the comfortable ride of the new car is truly significant. The engine has now been moved to a more forward position, and both the front and rear seats have also been moved forward, so the rear passengers sit right at the head of the rear axle, and the weight carried by the springs can be evenly distributed between the front and rear. The semi-elliptical extra-long springs used in the new car are meticulously constructed from Imola steel. The front springs are hooked to the front, rather than the back as in the past, making steering more flexible. The shock absorption device installed on the new car is the same as that used on airplanes, so its effectiveness is even greater. The new car engine has a bore of 3 and 1/4 inches, a stroke of 4 and 3/8 inches, and a horsepower of 87. All the original features, such as the renowned Dodge full-length cylinder cooling system, steel valve seats, pressure lubrication, four-ring aluminum pistons, automatic spark, and automatic choke, are all present in the new car. The brakes are truly hydraulic, and their ease of use and accuracy have long been praised. The reason why Dodge has the characteristic of absolute safety when stopping is due to this equipment. Dodge engineers have been using hydraulic brakes for a long time, and now they have more than eight years of experience.</p>
<p>As for the chassis, the new Dodge car has even more distinctive features, such as the patented floating power engine mount, harmonic silent transmission, increased foot space for the driver, streamlined steel wheels, independent parking brake, and the option to install a radio amplifier in the rear compartment of the sedan. These are all its most prominent features. The new Dodge Six-Cylinder car has a wheelbase of 112 inches and is equipped with a 78-horsepower engine. It is a low-priced car. As for the DeLuxe Six-Cylinder car, it has a wheelbase of 115 inches, and the engine it is equipped with has a horsepower of 82.</p>
<h3>Quasi-Scientific Car Research Methods</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Modern car manufacturing methods are entirely based on scientific approaches. Whether in structure, engine, or style, they are all completed based on continuous experimentation. As Mr. MacKahn, the general manager of Walter P. Chrysler Corporation, said, "Car manufacturing research methods have completely reached a quasi-scientific level." Mr. MacKahn also said that research encompasses a wide range, with the most important being the study of public preferences. The second is the research work in the chemical laboratory, and the equipment of the testing department and the proving ground. If you want to make a perfect car, then these main research tasks are indispensable.</p>
<p>The study of car buyers' preferences is a relatively new facility. Taking General Motors Corporation as an example, their work in this area is also very important. Thanks to the completion of this work, the factory can thoroughly understand what kind of cars car buyers need. They proceed according to what the market needs, which can at least avoid the criticism of "building cars behind closed doors."</p>
<p>This research work of soliciting public opinion is very similar to a political election, which gathers the will of all parties as its will. Therefore, this part of the work includes a step of soliciting opinions from all parties. They distribute a detailed questionnaire to many car owners and analyze their opinions by category. The results are used as a goal for engineers to reform. In recent years, the total research of buyers and institutions has become the forerunner of body, frame, and motorcycle improvements. In the future, there will be no changes if there are no improvements. If there are any changes, this target will be used as a criterion.</p>
<p>Guided by the preferences of the public, this is due to consultation with the public and the acquisition of sales. This method of improvement will continue year by year. This is not something that one person can obtain, nor is it something that a group of people can improve. Apart from starting with research work and adding the meticulous experiments of engineers, there is no way to reach the door of success. The so-called "genius is created by constant hard work." These words are not bad. For example, in the chemical laboratory of a car factory, we can often see engineers testing a part that has long been considered perfect, like a pump. However, they still want to improve it. An engineer must test and measure a ten-thousandth of an inch of the pump again and again. The purpose is nothing more than to discover a more efficient pump.</p>
<p>Any part of the car parts must undergo such research work in the manufacturing process. In addition to the pump, such as the carburetor, engine pad, axle, lever, etc., none is like this. Because apart from the quasi-scientific method, there is no other shortcut to find. In the General Factory's proving ground, there are various roads of different heights and unevenness. Experienced test drivers drive the prototype cars for tens of millions of miles. Only when they are satisfied can the new car be announced to the public.</p>
