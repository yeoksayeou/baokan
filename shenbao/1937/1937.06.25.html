<h3>國防線上二十（二十）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>（七）山西的國防經濟建設　兩種特徵：注重“出超”和“集中營業”</p>
<p>山西的經濟建設，因為種種環境上的原因，一二十年來，一直在進行，這固然已是舉世皆知的事了。不過由山西當局有覺悟地，有計劃地，有决心地，加以統制和發展，而使牠呈突飛猛進之象，却的確是“九一八”事變以後的事。“九一八”事變前，從國防方面說，山西是內地；然而“九一八”事變，突然把東三省失去，使：長城各口和熱河，成了前線，晋綏成了最近前線的後方。而這時，閻白川先生，就已經濟清了一件事，那就是長城各口和熱河的疏失可能性，是非常之大；萬一不幸的話，那末，晋綏兩省，是會一下子落在國防最前線，而被迫着，擔負起國防前衛的任務的。所以，二十年十二月，四屆一中全會在南京開會的時候，他曾經同時提出兩個議案：一個是“請政府檢拨十萬勁旅死守錦州以救危亡；”另一個，是“請政府”時確定，十年自强計劃。”</p>
<p>可是事實上，提出這兩個議案的當時，閻先生大槪也知道了；第一個“死守錦州”的計劃，在我們實力和當時的國內形勢上，皆是不可能；而第二個“十年自强”計劃，在施行上，也沒有十足的把握。其結果，晋綏之成為國防第一線，總是雖以避免的。於是，在這樣的認識下，山西就開始加緊了牠本身的經濟建設。用閻先生自己底話，就是：“以達造產救國之目的。”所以，一直到二十一年下半年，山西的當局們，就確定好了他們的所謂“省政十年建設計劃。”</p>
<p>幾年以來，山西在這種認識和計劃下，所進行的經濟建設成績，到底怎樣呢？記者這回在山西曾經考察牠各方面的情况，覺得我們至少已可以這樣斷定了；在未來的我國對外禦侮總力裏，山西一定是以牠經濟建設的成果，供獻牠最重要的一部份力量。</p>
<p>記者這回在山西的時候，對於牠的經濟建設，曾致以最大的努力，希望能多看清一點牠的面目。而對於牠的特別精神與方法，尤其竭力去考察推求，很想能有所發現，以告讀者。四月二十五號，本報的週刋裏，記者有過一篇通信，曾經指出山西當局經營經濟建設的四個特別方法，在這裏，不再重複。然而記者想起來，他們另外還有一個特別方法，也是我們萬不能忽略的，那就是：牠的政治與經濟的合而為一。用山西的特別名詞，就是：“政治的經濟化”。這名詞的內容含義，我想衹有用他們自己的話，可以解釋得清楚：一經濟化的政治下的官吏，應以為人民算賬為唯一責任。從前的官吏，催不齊糧就要撤差。現在的官吏，不能為人民賺錢，就應受處分。山西目前的地方官吏如縣長之類，他們的責職，除政治之外，實在還負着一層推進經濟建設的重任。</p>
<p>不過，除去牠經濟的特別方法而外，山西的國防經濟建設，還是有牠的特徵的。假如忽略了這些特徵，那末，我們對於山西的經濟建設的性質，將無法把握，對牠本來的動向，也無從找尋了。記者實地考察訪問的結果，深覺得，牠的特徵，我們可以歸納分析一下，提出最大的兩點來：第一點是注重“出超”，第二點，是“集中營業”這兩點，是山西加緊國防經濟建設的，精神上最精徵的處所說起來非常抽象而乏味，似乎純是理論。其實，這全是事實深處的事實，記者寫着這通信的時候，沒有一點沒有根據，沒有一個輪斷不經過仔細思索的。（說的對不對，那當然是記者個人的能力和見識問題了。）現在，大家注意山西經濟建設的熱忱，一天一天在增長，然而，大家常常聽到山西當局提倡服用“土貨，”又常常聽到山西公家的經營“土貨商店”，等等，因而，不免常常要常引起兩個疑慮：㊀這一切，不是多少帶有一省自足自給的色彩麼？㊁在牠的精神裏，不是不免含有“與民爭利”的成份麼？</p>
<p>假如肯定這兩個疑慮，那末，顯然無所謂“國防經濟，”是不相容的兩件事，一切山西所有的經濟建設，也許就不能冠上國防兩個字。在相反方面，假如我們拿牠去問任何一位山西人士，他一定是否定的。那末，又將怎麼說明？記者曾經把這些提出來，多方面地傾聽了山西人士們的解說，又仔細地研究牠實際的情况，結果，我是站到否定的這面來了。為了使讀者們能把握山西“國防經濟建設”精神的核心，雖是枯燥的題料，也祇好勉勉强强地寫了下去。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>川越大使啟程返任</h3>
<p>— 高</p>
<p>滯留本國承受機宜之川越大使。已定於今日啟程返任。並聞、携有對華政策之新訓令。俾在靑年首相指導之下。從事於外交之折衝。前途情勢轉變至如何程度。當為吾人所亟欲周悉者。據日外務省發言人表示。川越此次返任將努力增進中日兩國之睦誼。乘機重開調整關係之會議。但就日外次崛內之談話。則又似不欲於匆遽間開始此項之談判。卽川越本人。亦謂無從速進行談判之意。同時且聞近衛內閣之新訓令中。仍不放棄所謂廣田三原則。唯暫勿强迫其立卽實現。凡此惝恍不一之傳說。衡諸日常鐫受之印象。則遷流之所屆。固已不難想見。雖然。片面之臆斷。未足以概全。吾人亦唯有期待川越大使返任以後。於事實上明白臚示其內幕之真相而已。</p>
<p>在川越大使未曾返達任所之先。在兩國調整談判未經賡續進行之際。吾人試一檢討國內紛擾之情形。良足視為某方旨趣之反映。汕案糾紛。延不解决。華北局勢。轉趨緊張。駐屯軍之大舉演習也。領事武官等之更迭會議也。機關團體之分別形成作戰組織也。重要官員之深入內地訪問往返傳達使命也。無在不暗示非常時期之迫近。及其準備步驟之積極至。所稱為靑島稅警團事件。塘沾附近漁船被擊事件。聖農園被焚事件。非出有意之督過。卽屬砌詞而藉口。他如浪人滋事之衝突。私貨被截之交涉。則正在不斷惹起之中。隨時有釀成事態之可能。夫以調整關係為號召。而事實之激盪如彼。以恢復情感為要求。而形勢之格禁又如此。吾人處茲啼笑皆非之局面中。誠有不勝其遺憾者矣。</p>
<p>或者以為日方所以必欲於談判開始之前。多方造成嚴重之空氣者。不外一種威脅之作用。意在促成我方之就範。觀於日報社評之措辭。一則曰。“華北現狀因必要而使然。日本不能僅因中國之願望而有所變更。”再則曰。“中日兩國之願望距離過遠。似難有豐盛之收獲。”吾人就其絃外之餘音。不難明其意嚮之何屬。其實抱如此觀點者。已陷入極大之錯誤。須知我國外交方針。早經確定在案。王外長所謂祗求自存與共存。無所謂軟化與硬化。固已由歷任外交當局明白申言之矣。故川越茲來果能就平等互惠之原則。求一切懸案之解决。循序平進宜非難事。否則我方已屆忍無可忍之限度。寗有再事退讓之餘地。東亞危機。前途莫測。轉捩之權。不操自我。具有外交手腕之川越大使。對此繫鈴解鈴之責任其亦知所自處乎。</p>

<p>［倫敦］東京方面日昨傳出消息、謂日本廣田新外相、業已訓令駐英大使吉田茂、與英國外務部當局開始進行談判、此間消息靈通人士聞訊之餘、咸感滿意、按自上星期以來、英日兩國政府卽已有所接觸、因而證明雙方已有進行有益的談判之可能、至於未來談判之內容、各關係方面、均認為當就政治經濟問題加以討論、而在政治方面則當以中國問題為主、關於此層、英國方面之主要願望、乃使日本承認中國領土主權完整之原則、並將中國門戶開放與各國在華貿易機會均等之原則、予以證實、至“滿洲國”承認問題是否亦當討論及之、則英國官塲方面拒不加以說明、特半官界若干人士以為此一問題、勢難擱置不談惟茲事體大英國政府在探詢國聯會大多數會員國意見之前、勢難加以考慮耳、至以經濟問題而言、英日兩國咸願樹立一種制度、用以促進雙方貿易、但英國各自治領政府所採用之進口稅率、并不一致、此乃困難所在、此外、英國關係方面深恐英日兩國進行談判之後、蘇聯方面或亦發生反響、爰確切說明未來談判、並不針對任何第三國而發云、（中央社二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>從前要馬塲下台的財閥，就是支持結城上台的財閥。賀屋和結城的關係比較深，和馬塲自然要鬧蹩扭了。馬場是軍部支持的，馬塲出馬，大部份財閥卽起恐慌。近衛內閣是標榜“融合各派勢力”的，然而各派的勢力，也正不容易融合。</p>
<p>到今天（六月八日），企書廳總裁的位置，已决定由廣田外相兼任了。閣外一部份財閥的反對，閣內賀屋和</p>
<p>吉野的“聯合戰線”，終於阻碍着馬場，令馬塲坐不到總裁的椅子上去。</p>
<p>廣田在此次新內閣中，是所謂沒有派別色彩的。但由他任首相時的成績看來，誰能否認他和軍部及馬塲的關係呢？現在由他兼任企書廳總裁，說是可以緩和閣外，閣內的“對立”。但　能在一個擔子上，平挑起賀屋和馬塲嗎？這由他過去的歷史，已可以想像一點了。</p>
<p>廣田是“對華三大原則”的首創者，他此次出任外交，和中國是很有關係的。廣田外交的具體方針，到今日</p>
<p>還未正式發表。但根據連日報紙的記載，已可看出一點眉目，大要是：</p>
<p>打破官僚獨善的秘密外交，令外交的進行不受政爭的影響。至於外交的根本方針，仍和一九三四年他就任外和時的聲明沒有兩樣。那聲明的主要內容是：“國家在躍進期間，自然不能和其他國家維持均衡，自然必發生國際的困難。若因此而想阻碍這躍進，那反而是擾亂世界和平了”。據此，可知以後的日本對華外交，還是不能改變他們的“三大原則”。只不過適應中國的情况，而或明或暗的用各種方法贯現吧了。</p>
<p>此外，拓相大谷尊和文相安井央二，在新內閣中比較是接近近衛，沒有自己的派別的。至於有馬賴寧（農相），中島久知平，永井柳太郎、鹽野季彥（法相及風見章（內閣書記是長）等，那是誰也知道，恐怕新黨運動的狂波，也許就要被他們掀動起來的。</p>
<p>根據陸，海軍的國防充實新規計劃，以及“革新政策”的貫行費……等，明年的預算，至少也將在三十五，六億之間。這當然近衛是知道的，而且賀屋藏相也必早已清楚。日本大衆生活的重壓，是只有益來益沉重了。所謂的“緩和國內對立”，並沒有把大衆加入這“對立”裏面去的。日本女作家平林太子女史說得不錯！“近衛內閣成立，是日本反動政治的强化”。</p>
<p>新內閣的政網，在先本是說打破成例，由首相自己擬稿的。但後來又决定只隨時公佈應真行的政策，不作任何形式的聲明了。這雖是有鑑於以前的內閣，常常言而不行，但從別一方面看來，也真够“懷抱琵琶半遮面”的意味。</p>

<h3>德僅退出監察未向西班牙報復</h3>
<p>英國各界為之寬慰　但監察制善後困難　英法研究局部封鎖</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國各界對於德國退出西班牙海面監察計劃、認為係解决四國未能妥洽處置德艦被攻事所引起之僵局後可歡迎之辦法、倫敦人士因自始至終未發生報復問題、為之一慰、衆信德國若干軍艦仍將駐於西班牙海岸附近、以保護德國航業、步德後塵退出監察計劃之意國、亦必有此同樣舉動、今後英法艦隊勢將擴大其活動範圍、而及於西國全部海岸線、否則亦將請不干涉委員會其他委員國、參加此監察工作、德意兩國雖已聲明退出監察計劃、然仍留於不干涉委員會、並仍遵守不干涉協定、（中央社二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］德國退出西班牙海面監察計劃之後、英國外相艾登雖謂、該國行動以此為限、但此間一般觀察家對於德國態度、仍不無隱憂、并對於下開兩種事實、認為難以索解、卽（一）德意兩國軍艦所擔任監察之區域、乃係西班牙政府軍所屬各港口、各該國退出監察計劃一舉、是於西國共和政府有利、然則何以出此、（二）德國雖聲明對於西國共和政府不擬採取任何直接行動、但該國軍艦、適於此際向地中海移動、其目的何在、此外、德國駐英大使里賓特羅甫頃已怱遽返國、此行目的何在、揣測之詞、不一而足、若干觀察家、甚至以德國或將續派大批志願兵、前往西班牙助戰、而德國與捷克兩國關係、或將趨於緊張為慮、至關於德意兩國退出監察計劃後、所可引起之初步影響、一般人以為、今後當有三種可能、（一）德意兩國軍艦所擔任之海面監察工作或由英法兩國軍艦代之執行、其在地中海沿岸、歸英國軍艦擔任、大西洋沿岸則歸法國軍艦擔任、（二）倫敦調整委員會或委託其他海軍國、擔任德意兩國所放棄之監察工作、（三）或則意將海面監察制度根本予以取消、查艾登外相日前在下議院發表演說時曾謂、不干涉政策施行情形、旣難使人滿意、英國或有從新考盧應付辦法之可能、此其所言或卽取消海面監察制度之謂也、（中央社二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英政府現正審愼考慮因德意退出海軍監察計劃所引起之局勢、英政府會同法政府研究封銷因德意退出西班牙東海濱外發生之罅隙問題但未獲不干涉委員會之贊同、不致有何决議同時意軍在馬拉加登陸及德軍艦在地中海大事活動之消息、此間多不之信、英外相艾登今日在下院宣稱、英軍艦在馬拉加區域担任巡暹職務者、並未報告意軍登陸事、英海軍部所得之情報、亦未徵實德軍艦行動之謠言云、（中央社二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］德意兩國退出西班牙國海面監察計劃以後所產生之局勢、業已成為英法兩國交換意見之主題法國大使考賓於今晨訪晤英國外相艾登、用意殆卽在此、目下所亟須明瞭者、乃監察計劃在現行情勢之下、能否賡續施行、暨德意兩國政府是否確欲在西班牙政附軍所屬各港海面逕自執行監察工作、此間外交界人士以為、不干涉辦法倘無賡續推行之可能、毋寗承認兩國內戰當事雙方為交戰團體、而由各國公開宣佈保守中立、換言之、卽承認戰事狀態業已發生、因之、各國均得以中立國資格、聽任國人以軍火接濟西國內戰雙方或以志願兵資格前往助戰、而不偏重任何一方、英國外交界人士并謂、卽此亦僅將現行事實在法理上予以承認而已、要之、無論如何、調整委員會當在最短時期之內、舉行會議、决定本身存廢問題云、（中央社廿四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於德國巡洋艦萊比錫號事件所引起之局勢、頃據探悉、昨日英國駐德大使漢德森在柏林與德國外長牛賴特舉行談話時、英國大使奉命向牛賴特宣稱、德國政府倘在地中海上作任何暴力行動、則在英國目中將視為局勢異常嚴重、牛賴特當卽答稱、德國行動常僅以退出西班牙海面監察之一事為限云、（中央社二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］今日據確息英國駐法大使費普斯曾告法外長台爾博斯稱、英國準備以全力防患、德國巡洋艦“萊普集”事件决不使成為燎原之火、法外長答稱與有同感、（廿三日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］據每日快報所悉、英國駐德大使今日通知德外長牛賴特、謂德國如為萊普集事件對西班牙政府採取武力報復行動、英國將認為造成嚴重局勢云、（廿四日國民電）</p>
<p>［柏林］德國退出監察計劃之後、外傳美國大使陶德曾就西班牙問題、向德國外長牛賴特有所進言、美國大使館方面、頃切實加以否認、（中央社二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］外相艾登今日在下院聲稱、渠已接到西班牙國民軍當局來文、陳述種種理由、要求承認其為交戰團體、英政府刻正考慮中、但不擬立卽改變對於此事之態度、並又接到一文、答覆英國關於英艦獵人號為水電轟炸事之抗議、據稱、英艦觸及埋於領海內之水雷、此說與獵人號所呈報之事實、顯相逕庭、英外部現方考慮應付步驟、前次抗議文中保留要求賠償損失與憮卹遇難艦員之問題、英政府曾請西班牙國民軍領袖弗朗哥將軍注意海牙公約、禁止在敵方口岸外埋置水雷、以期阻寨商航交通之條文、關於國民軍扣留英船貨物事、英國駐西班牙大使刻正催促國民軍當局對其將英船所裝貨物卸下運往內地之行為、加以說明云、（中央社二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>德國採取進退兩可政策</h3>
<p>未退出不干涉委員會　但已保留自由行動權</p>
<p>［柏林］德國暫時不致退出不干涉委員會、已經此間消息靈通方面加以證實、據稱、德國僅退出海面監察計劃、恢復於德艦被襲擊時之行動自由、德政府之熊度、已於今日德外長牛賴特與英大使漢特森進行簡短談話時、加以說明亦可於英外相艾登向下院報告時窺見一斑、（二十三日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［柏林］德國駐英大使里賓特羅甫、昨日將德國退出西班牙海軍監察之照會、送達英國外交部今日半官德國通訊社對於德國態度詳加闡述、該項聲明稱、</p>
<p>一、德國與其他各國不同、與西班牙人民在過去及現在、均無所爭執、更從未參加歷史上對西班牙土地之克服德國人民及政府、除對西班牙罹於內亂、深表同情外、惟一之希望乃西班牙早日恢復其獨立自由、德國除對西班牙有經濟與文化之關係外絕無將西班牙變為行政上之一省或國社運動之一區之野心、德政府此時决定退出國際海上監察者、乃使德國船艦如被襲擊時、可以恢復其行動之完全自由、此種態度已經德外長牛賴特、今日向英國駐德大使漢德森詳加說明、</p>
<p>二、德國自始至終、對西班牙內亂所抱態度、為“西班牙內亂限於西班牙人”易言之卽反對任何外國一切政治上財政上軍事上之干涉、但此種觀念、顯然未得某某民主國家之同意、志願兵及軍用品由莫斯科踴躍輸入、然而國民軍竟仍占上風、因而民主國家人士、認為如接受德意在不干涉委員會所持意見、則惟恐不足以牽制國民軍而暗助布爾雪維克矣、</p>
<p>三、雖然德政府仍宣佈、如不干涉委會、果能保證完全公正、則德國準備合作、因此德國乃參加監察辦法、詎料此項辦法完全失敗、布爾雪維克志願兵及軍用品之供給、仍源源不絕、</p>
<p>四、西班牙瓦倫西亞當局、欲破壞四國監察計劃、對英意德三國船艦加以“犯罪之襲擊”、以致有“德意志”號事件之發生德政府鑒於不干涉委員會及監察委員會、均不能作絲亳具體决議乃認為有採取報復之必要報復固不能補償損失、不過給予西政府一個教訓冀同樣情事、不再發生、乃有六月十二日之四國協定、</p>
<p>五、當時德國命令參加監察船隻、如過西政府艦隊或飛機之襲擊立卽報以開火而西政府遂改變以潛水艇襲擊矣事實之正確、已經德國海軍當局及德國政府之保證、</p>
<p>六、並依據六月十二日協定、提交其他監察西班牙岸各國、共同討論、要求立卽採取共同抵抗辦法</p>
<p>七、英法兩國政府不相信調整會會員監察隊份子之報告、而以瓦倫西亞之否認、卽主張日澈查事實真象之必要、德政府對於此點深難忍受、</p>
<p>八、但為以最大努力、謀求同意起見、德政府在日昨倫敦會談中取消任何實際報復之提議、僅要求立卽聯合示威、以昭警告、此外、英法兩國所要求之調查亦可同時進行、</p>
<p>九、如此溫和而退步之要求、英法政府仍予拒絕、則六月十二協定、非但具文、直為有害德政府為保護自身利益起見、决定從此退出監察機關、至於意政府見解之完全脗合、至表滿意云、（二十二日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［柏林］德外交通訊報總述德國對於國際局勢之態度、略稱、集體機構對於萊比錫號事件、缺乏團結精神、德國自感失望但並不驚異、蓋大戰後之經驗、證明公平上判斷國際事件之誠意、依然缺乏也德政府對於西戰之早日結束及避免引起歐洲大戰之努力、仍未減少云、（二十三日國民海通電）</p>

<h3>意國與德沆瀣一氣</h3>
<p>否認派軍　赴西斑牙</p>
<p>［倫敦］意大利大使格籣第頃以照會一件、送致艾登外相、其內容如下、“在西班牙海面担任監察軍艦、遭受事故之後、英法德意四國、應有聯帶一致之神神、俾得出於共同行動、但各該代表最近進行談話結果、業已證明此項精神、並不存在、意國政府深用惋惜、玆將確定退出海面監察計畫”云、（中央社二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］消息另通人士頃宣稱、德意兩國軍艦前所監察之區域、若由英法　國海軍代之行施監察、則將加以反對、意大利政府現正考慮、倘有他國船舶裝載志願兵或軍火接濟西國政府軍、或當有意國軍艦出而攔截、至於德國、他日若對西國共和政府行施報復手段、意國是否出而參加、雖不可知、但據官方人士聲稱、德意兩國按之柏林羅馬政治軸心、仍當維持聯繫關係、又謂意國似當出席倫敦調整委員會、並賡續遵守不干涉協定所載各項約束、但以其他各國亦予以遵守為條件云、（中央社二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>法郎前途</h3>
<p>貶價與否　謠言甚多</p>
<p>［巴黎］新任財長龐萊尚未由華盛頓返國之前、究將如何挽救財政之危局、外間謠言甚熾、有謂政府擬於龐氏尚未返國之前、卽將法郎貶價、超過去年所允許之程度者、惟他方面則覺政府不致驟出此策、同時亦有謂法郎之貶價、僅屬取快於一時結果實無價值可言、並聞若干消息靈通者言、龐氏返國之後、擬將法郎貶價至一九二六年之程度、使法郎與金鎊之比例、為每鎊合一百二十四法郎云、（中央社二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>法國政局暫告和緩</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>單據以國文為主</h3>
<p>— 趙夢瀾</p>
<p>最近市商會有通告給各業公會，其中除“凡與洋商貿易所用單據，責令照章貼用印花，以重功令”外，還有一件是“刪去貿易上常用之‘如遇疑義時，以洋文為準’之條文，改為‘以華文為準’，以維平等原則”。“既居留其國，應服從其國家之行政法令”，所以“貼用印花以重功令”，原是理所當然。這裏不談。關於單據上以“洋文為準”改為“以華文為準”，則有一些感想說一說。</p>
<p>單據上以“洋文為準”的弊病，市商會的通告中已說得很明白：“華洋契約（例如保險單所列之條文），所列條文，每每列有‘遇有疑義時，以洋文為準’之字樣，我商人不察，視為平淡無奇，一遇事端發生，彼能曲解條文，涉訟能反敗為勝，受其累者，筆難盡述……”；從“筆難盡述”的“受其累者”所積得的經驗，知道這“視為平淡無奇”的“為準”問題不能再“視為平淡無奇”，雖然已不免遲了一步，但是能够亡羊補牢。使受其累者不再“受累”，那總是可喜的。</p>
<p>一個獨立國家，應以其本國的文字為主，那原是一般的通例，而洋商的貿易單據，既以華人為對象，自然也更應“以華交為準”，可是洋商為利用我政府無治外法權等種種弱點起見，加以過去“我商人不察”，以致“一遇事端發生，彼能曲解絛文”，這雖一半是由於“商人不察”，而至少還有另一半却是為了人家利用我們的無治外法權等等之故！由之，我們對於領事裁判權等的收回，又該是如何的急切！</p>
<p>現在，我們既覺悟到了“以洋文為準”的“受其累者，筆難盡述”了，然則“以華文為準”的前途又怎樣呢？市商會的通告說得好，“我商界誠能一致表示，務以國體為重，在彼亦當順從顧主心理，自思變計，此中關鍵，操之在我，惟視努力如何”耳！</p>
<p>而於要求洋商以後單據，“以華文為準”之外，尤不能無言者，則我們的政府機關等種種公文單據，更該是“以華文為準”，如與洋人無關，（洋人服務於我國機關者，則應該令他們熟悉華文，不應該我們遷就他們）則並應該廢除洋文，因為無論任何國家，沒有採用別國的文字來發號施令，曉喩人民，或由人民用別國文字來呈請政府的。</p>
<p>然而在我們的海關，則人民呈報的報單，便“以洋文為準”，這雖可以推諉為過去的我國海關職權，旁落於外人之手，現任海關的高級職員中，更有不少洋人，可是，海關既是我們的行政機關，中華民國既是獨立國家，我們難道就能允許這畸形現象的存在嗎？</p>
<h3>寂寞</h3>
<p>— 白岩</p>
<p>來信說，“你住到故鄉這樣僻靜的地方，未免太寂寞了。但寂寞對我應是慣常的，何況寂寞也不定是苦味，自從回到這地方來，體驗寂寞的滋味，更深而也更真切了。</p>
<p>前幾天不斷的雨下得我不能進城，想讀點書又無甚興緻，惟一可作的事便是靜靜地坐着不動，窗外天色陰沉得很，簷溜像掛着，雨絲時有直斜，但風聲被雨給淹沒了。雨下了三天，我大半的時間就一樣對了窗子木然枯坐，絲毫不想念什麼，只覺枯寂中有種淡淡的味道，像啜飲一盞清茶，感覺似乎在舒服和不舒服之外，情緒又似在感傷和愉快之間，這時不想讀書，亦不想見什麼人，便是我終日相思着的××，也不願在這時來攪破我的寂寞。</p>
<p>這樣的寂寞味，我想用幾句話將它描寫清楚些，但我找不出適當的字，我想這樣說：這種感覺既不是鬆快，又不是沉醉，只像一滴薄荷膠滴進心裏，漸漸沁透全身，使全身都覺到涼，而不在冰鎮似的冷，在幽靜中，傳染上這種近於詩的情味，才能作出“雨打梨花深閉門”那樣靜美的句子。</p>
<p>近來，我常到蘆葦叢生的寗園去，在蘆葦的大海中間被我發見一條乾鬆的小徑，可以走進蘆花深處，從遠處看這蘆花，見茫茫一片白浪中，秋意撩人，雖然也覺得美，但不及深深潛近蘆葦海裏，能得塵外的逸趣，我每次走進這條小徑，聽着周圍似風似雨的察察聲，便忘了身在什麼地方。</p>
<p>這樣說給你聽，你也許以為我有了孤獨癖，其實，寂寞有時也能和人共享。一個沒有月的晚上，和×從葉谷村一家小店裏喝了兩壺蓮花白出來，在一個橋上坐了多時，那時水的深處映着無數的星辰，淺處有糢糊的樹影，遠方則有傍水人家的幾星燈火，我們坐了兩三個鐘點，彼此靜默着，我凝视着那幾家有燈的窗子，想像每一個燈光下正在圍聚的家庭，因而也想起了滾滾江水邊我的家。但我並不因此而起了鄉愁，這時的心已被星光夜影的寂寞籠罩了。×呢，我相信他所感受的跟我相同，他決不是在感傷，感傷時不能無半聲嘆息，當更不是快樂，快樂時人的嘴是不愛緘默的，他所咀嚼的定是兩者之間的寂寞味。</p>
<p>寂寞雖有時令人煩燥，却也會使人感到凄涼，能在那似酸似苦的況味中，體會出恬滴與寗靜，那寂寞便也可愛了</p>

<h3>Lushan Summer Training to Begin</h3>
<p>Approximately 14,000 trainees　First Session to commence next month on the 4th　Two major new buildings already completed</p>
<p>[Jiujiang] The Guling telephone reports that the Lushan summer training, of national revival significance, will commence on July 4th. For a week, people have been coming and going on the Jiu-Gu road in an endless stream, all to prepare for, participate in, or work at the summer training. Guling Street has become more lively, with a sudden increase in pedestrians, especially military officers wearing temporary yellow silk badges, who are extremely busy but in high spirits. Approximately 14,000 people have been transferred to the mountain for training, which will be held in phases, with each phase accommodating about 4,500 people. These include military officers, police officers, county magistrates, military training instructors, political training instructors, party affairs personnel, middle school principals, New Life Movement staff, and Boy Scout leaders. Based on their nature, they are divided into nine groups, each with a leader in charge. During training, in addition to general training, each group will have common training. The first session is scheduled for registration on the 1st and 2nd of next month, team formation on the 3rd, and commencement on the 4th. Each session will last 20 days, with approximately 15 days of training. Each session will be followed immediately by the next, and the training will be completed by early September. After the summer, it is expected that these several thousand new dynamic forces will be distributed across the country to promote national revival in a systematic and methodical manner. It is foreseeable that China's future politics will see new dynamics and reap new results. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>[Jiujiang] The Guling telephone reports that two major new buildings for the Lushan summer training, the Lushan Training School and the Auditorium, have now been fully completed. Each of these major constructions took more than a year to complete, costing around 700,000 yuan. The Training School's magnificent and exquisite architecture will be the crown of Lushan. It is entirely constructed of copper, steel, and cement. General Western-style houses in Lushan are typically built of stone. The interior is fully equipped with amenities such as heating, electric lights, and washbasins. The building has six floors and can accommodate 1,200 people in total, with each room housing between 20 and 40 people. To the left and right of the bedrooms are washrooms, allocated according to the number of people in the bedrooms. In addition, there are classrooms and offices. The auditorium is in the palace style, covered with glazed tiles, and divided into two levels. The lower level serves as a dining hall, and the upper level is the auditorium, which can accommodate several thousand people and can also show films. All facilities are also extremely well-equipped. These two major buildings are located next to the library on Hedong Road in Guling, with excellent terrain facing the water and backing onto the mountains, and beautiful scenery. They will be used for part of the summer training. China's new cadres will be produced here, and after some years, it will become a historical scenic spot. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang's Illness Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>In good spirits and with a good appetite　To go to Lushan for recuperation in the near future</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After Chairman Wang attended the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 17th and returned to his residence, he suffered from intermittent heart palpitations. After medical treatment, his condition was immediately alleviated and he is now resting quietly at his residence. Central News Agency reporters, aware that people at home and abroad are greatly concerned about Chairman Wang's health, visited Mr. Zeng Zhongming, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, to inquire about the details of Wang's recent condition. Mr. Zeng informed them as follows: Mr. Zeng said that Chairman Wang's condition has gradually improved in recent days through the joint treatment of doctors Qi Shounan and Song Wusheng, as well as Wang's personal physician Luo Guanglin. The jaundice caused by gallstones was very mild, with only yellowing of the skin between the fingers and toes. After careful examination and treatment by the doctors, and several days of bed rest, the yellowing has disappeared, indicating that bile is no longer flowing into the bloodstream. Currently, the doctors are still advising Chairman Wang to continue resting quietly for several days to allow his liver to return to health, and he is also taking medication to prevent gallbladder inflammation. As for the intermittent heart palpitations, medication is still being administered to restore normal function as soon as possible. Although Chairman Wang's health has not fully recovered, he is in good spirits and has a good appetite. However, he is following the doctors' instructions to avoid all disturbances and rest quietly every day. He should recover almost completely in a few days. Chairman Wang has decided to go to Lushan in the near future so that he can attend the talks as usual and recuperate in the mountains. The doctors agree to Chairman Wang's trip to Lushan, but advise him not to give lengthy speeches or talks to avoid overexertion. The departure date has not yet been determined. When the time comes, only physician Luo Guanglin will accompany him so that he can check his health at any time. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chu Minyi told people that after treatment by doctors Song Wusheng and Qi Shounan, Wang's pulse rate has returned to normal, and the sugar content in his urine has also gradually decreased. Song came to Nanjing by car yesterday for treatment, and he has improved slightly compared to a few days ago. Wang plans to rest quietly in Nanjing and then go to Lushan for a long period of recuperation. Due to the doctors' orders, he may not be able to attend the Lushan talks in the short term.

It is indeed a rigid bill that will enable the establishment of a solid foundation for domestic finance in the future, indirectly and directly developing the national economic strength. At the same time, as a representative of the national financial institutions, it will use its reputation to seek the adjustment of international finance and the balance of international trade, and its advantages can be brought into play. The reserve is sufficient, and the cash reserve has been increased to 80%, which is 20% more than the original 60% cash reserve. At the same time, matters that could affect the soundness of the organization, such as ordinary banks' acceptance of company securities and ordinary mortgages, have been carefully studied and avoided, so that the Reserve Bank is completely a reserve warehouse and does not retain any commercialization, in order to maintain the lasting credit of the currency.

<h3>Agenda of the Legislative Yuan's Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>Sun Ke Postpones Trip to Southwest for Inspection　Penalties for Unpaid Salt Tax Invalid</p>
<p>[Nanjing] In addition to reviewing the Central Reserve Bank Law at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 25th, the national ordinary general budget案 for the 26th year is also planned to be reviewed.

<h3>The Judicial Yuan Issues a Circular Prohibiting Arbitrary Arrests of Criminal Defendants</h3>
<p>Adopting Methods of Respectful Guarantee and Restrictions　To Facilitate Convenience and Comply with Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Judicial Yuan believes that in recent times, it is inevitable that various courts and judicial organs in various counties have arbitrarily arrested criminal defendants. Moreover, the suspension of arrest often only occurs after a specific application is made and permission is granted. It must be known that most criminal defendants are poor and helpless. Guarantee money is undoubtedly unaffordable, and even finding a guarantor with a solid business is not easy. This has led to the legal provisions for the suspension of arrest being equivalent to a formality, which is contrary to the principle of compassion for the people. Now that summer has arrived and the weather is getting hotter, the detention centers are crowded, and illness and death are a concern. It is imperative to expedite communication to emphasize humanity. The Judicial Yuan has specially instructed the Ministry of Judicial Administration to comply and has issued a circular to the presidents and chief prosecutors of the high courts of various provinces to instruct their subordinates to pay attention to the matter. Hereafter, criminal defendants must not be arbitrarily arrested or detained for long periods of time. For those who are eligible for suspension of arrest, in addition to being ordered to provide a guarantee when it is necessary to do so, methods of respectful guarantee and restrictions on residence should also be adopted to facilitate convenience and comply with laws and regulations.

<h3>Twenty (20) on the National Defense Line</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shudi of This Newspaper</p>
<p>(7) Shanxi's National Defense Economic Construction: Two Characteristics: Emphasis on "Trade Surplus" and "Centralized Operations"</p>
<p>Shanxi's economic construction has been underway for one or two decades due to various environmental reasons, which is already a globally known fact. However, it was only after the "September 18th Incident" that the Shanxi authorities consciously, planned, and resolutely controlled and developed it, causing it to show a rapid development trend. Before the "September 18th Incident," Shanxi was an inland province from a national defense perspective; however, the "September 18th Incident" suddenly led to the loss of the three northeastern provinces, making the various passes of the Great Wall and Jehol the front lines, and Jin and Sui becoming the rear areas closest to the front lines. At this time, Mr. Yan Xishan had already understood one thing, that is, the possibility of losing the various passes of the Great Wall and Jehol was very high; if the worst happened, then Jin and Sui provinces would suddenly fall on the front line of national defense, and would be forced to take on the task of the national defense vanguard. Therefore, in December of the 20th year, when the First Plenary Session of the Fourth National Congress was held in Nanjing, he simultaneously proposed two motions: one was "Please the government to allocate 100,000 elite troops to defend Jinzhou to save the crisis"; the other was "Please the government" to determine the "Ten-Year Self-Strengthening Plan."</p>
<p>But in fact, at the time of proposing these two motions, Mr. Yan probably already knew that the first plan of "defending Jinzhou" was impossible given our strength and the domestic situation at that time; and the second "Ten-Year Self-Strengthening" plan was not fully guaranteed in its implementation. As a result, the situation of Jin and Sui becoming the front line of national defense was ultimately unavoidable. Therefore, under such understanding, Shanxi began to intensify its own economic construction. In Mr. Yan's own words, it was "to achieve the goal of creating production to save the country." Therefore, until the second half of the 21st year, the authorities in Shanxi had finalized their so-called "Ten-Year Construction Plan for Provincial Governance."</p>
<p>Over the past few years, what have been the results of Shanxi's economic construction under this understanding and plan? Having investigated various aspects of the situation in Shanxi this time, the reporter feels that we can at least conclude that in the future overall national effort to resist foreign aggression, Shanxi will definitely contribute its most important strength with the results of its economic construction.</p>
<p>During this trip to Shanxi, the reporter made the greatest effort to see more clearly what it was like. In particular, I tried to investigate and seek out the special spirit and methods, and wanted to find something to tell the readers. In the weekly publication of this newspaper on April 25th, the reporter had a letter pointing out the four special methods of Shanxi authorities in managing economic construction, which will not be repeated here. However, the reporter thinks that there is another special method that we must not ignore, that is: the integration of its politics and economy. In Shanxi's special term, it is "economicization of politics." I think that the content and meaning of this term can only be explained clearly in their own words: One, officials under economicized politics should regard accounting for the people as their only responsibility. In the past, officials were dismissed if they failed to collect enough grain. Now, officials who cannot make money for the people should be punished. The current local officials in Shanxi, such as county magistrates, in addition to politics, are also shouldering the heavy responsibility of promoting economic construction.</p>
<p>However, in addition to its special economic methods, Shanxi's national defense economic construction still has its own characteristics. If these characteristics are ignored, then we will not be able to grasp the nature of Shanxi's economic construction, and there will be no way to find out its original direction. As a result of on-site investigations and interviews, the reporter deeply feels that we can summarize and analyze its characteristics, and put forward the two largest points: the first point is to focus on "trade surplus," and the second point is "centralized operations." These two points are the most distinctive places in the spirit of Shanxi's intensified national defense economic construction. It sounds very abstract and dull, and seems to be purely theoretical. In fact, this is all facts deep inside the facts. When the reporter is writing this letter, there is not a single thing without basis, and not a single conclusion that has not been carefully considered. (Whether it is right or wrong is, of course, a matter of the reporter's personal ability and knowledge.) Nowadays, everyone's enthusiasm for Shanxi's economic construction is growing day by day, however, everyone often hears that Shanxi authorities advocate taking "local goods," and often hears that Shanxi public companies operate "local goods stores," and so on, therefore, people cannot help but often raise two doubts: ㊀ Is not all of this somewhat characterized by provincial self-sufficiency? ㊁ Does not its spirit inevitably contain elements of "competing with the people for profit"?</p>
<p>If these two doubts are affirmed, then it is obvious that there is no so-called "national defense economy," and the two things are incompatible. All of Shanxi's economic construction may not be able to be crowned with the two words national defense. On the contrary, if we ask any Shanxi person about it, he will definitely deny it. Then, how will we explain it? The reporter once raised these issues, listened to the explanations of Shanxi people from various aspects, and carefully studied the actual situation. As a result, I stand on the side of denial. In order to enable readers to grasp the core of the spirit of Shanxi's "national defense economic construction," even if it is a dry topic, I have to reluctantly write it down.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Kawagoe Departs to Return to Post</h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>Ambassador Kawagoe, who had been staying in his home country to receive instructions, is scheduled to depart today to return to his post. It is also reported that he carries new directives for China policy, so that under the guidance of the young prime minister, he can engage in diplomatic negotiations. To what extent the future situation will change is what we are eager to know. According to a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kawagoe's return this time will strive to enhance the friendship between China and Japan, and take the opportunity to reopen the conference to adjust relations. However, according to the remarks of Japanese Vice Minister Horiuchi, it seems that he does not want to start this negotiation in a hurry. Even Kawagoe himself said that there is no intention to proceed with negotiations quickly. At the same time, it is also heard that the new directives of the Konoe Cabinet still do not abandon the so-called three principles of Hirota, but only temporarily do not force their immediate realization. All these inconsistent rumors, considering the impressions we receive daily, make it not difficult to imagine where the changes will lead. However, one-sided speculation is not enough to cover everything. We can only expect Ambassador Kawagoe to reveal the true inside story in fact after returning to his post.</p>
<p>Before Ambassador Kawagoe has returned to his post, and before the negotiation on adjusting relations between the two countries has resumed, let us try to examine the domestic disturbances, which can be regarded as a reflection of a certain party's interests. The Shantou case disputes are not resolved for a long time, and the situation in North China has become tense. The large-scale exercises of the garrison troops, the successive meetings of consular military attachés, the separate formation of combat organizations by organizations and groups, and the in-depth visits to the interior by important officials to convey missions back and forth, all imply the imminent approach of an extraordinary period and the active steps of preparation. The so-called Qingdao Tax Police Regiment incident, the fishing boat shooting incident near Tanggu, and the burning of Shengnong Garden are either intentional overzealousness or excuses. Other conflicts such as the trouble caused by vagrant samurai and the negotiations on interception of smuggled goods are constantly being provoked and may lead to incidents at any time. The situation of calling for adjusting relations, but the impact of the facts is like that, and the situation of demanding the restoration of feelings, but the form of restriction is like this, we are in a situation of neither crying nor laughing, and we sincerely regret it.</p>
<p>Some people think that the reason why the Japanese side must create a serious atmosphere in many ways before the start of negotiations is nothing more than a kind of threat, intending to promote our compromise. Looking at the wording of the Japanese newspaper's editorial, one says, "The current situation in North China is inevitable because it is necessary. Japan cannot change it simply because of China's wishes." The other says, "The distance between the wishes of China and Japan is too far, and it seems difficult to have a rich harvest." We can easily understand the direction of their intentions from the undertones. In fact, those who hold such a view have fallen into a great error. It must be known that our country's diplomatic policy has long been determined. Foreign Minister Wang's so-called only seeking self-preservation and coexistence, with no so-called softening or hardening, has already been clearly stated by successive diplomatic authorities. Therefore, if Kawagoe can come here to seek the solution of all outstanding issues on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, it should not be difficult to advance step by step. Otherwise, our side has reached the limit of what we can tolerate, and there is no room for further concessions. The East Asian crisis is unpredictable, and the power of turning the tide is not in our hands. Does Ambassador Kawagoe, who has diplomatic skills, know where his responsibility lies for tying and untying this bell?</p>
<h3>London Figures Observe Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Beneficial to the Far East</h3>
<p>Pacific Peace Pact to Be Discussed As Well; Ambassador Guo Says Britain Must Respect China's Status</p>
<p>[London] Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi spoke with a Reuters interviewer today about the upcoming talks between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Japanese Ambassador to Britain Yoshida, saying that China, of course, will pay close attention and have a deep interest in this matter. I believe that Anglo-Japanese relations in the Far East can make China and Japan adjust their relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and it is easier to succeed. I heard that Japan's desire to achieve this is no less enthusiastic than China's. It is now generally acknowledged that the interests of China and Britain in the Far East are related. We now have reason to believe that in future negotiations, China's economic and political rights and interests will be fully taken care of. So far, the newspapers have not commented on the future talks between the British Foreign Secretary and the Japanese Ambassador. All parties in London related to the Far East sincerely welcome this talk, and deeply believe that the actual results that can be obtained will be beneficial to all ethnic groups in the Far East. It is heard that the political circles see the future as promising, and will not publish anything during the talks in order to make it easier to succeed. The main purpose of the talks will be to eliminate various misunderstandings on national policy issues. It is heard that everything from general trade relations to various issues in China will be involved. It is now believed that Britain and Japan should better understand each other's will in China. The proposal for a new Pacific Convention put forward by the Imperial Conference also seems to be discussed. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>[London] News came from Tokyo yesterday that the new Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has instructed the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigeru Yoshida, to begin negotiations with the British Foreign Office authorities. Relevant people here were satisfied after hearing the news. Since last week, the governments of Britain and Japan have been in contact, thus proving that both sides have the possibility of conducting useful negotiations. As for the content of future negotiations, all relevant parties believe that political and economic issues should be discussed, and in the political aspect, the main focus should be on the China issue. Regarding this level, the main desire of the British side is to make Japan recognize the principle of China's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and confirm the principle of open door to China and equal trade opportunities for all countries in China. As to whether the issue of recognition of "Manchukuo" should also be discussed, British officials refused to explain. However, some people in semi-official circles believe that this issue is difficult to put aside and not discuss. However, the British government is unlikely to consider it before inquiring about the opinions of most member states of the League of Nations. As for economic issues, Britain and Japan are willing to establish a system to promote bilateral trade, but the import tariffs adopted by the governments of the various autonomous territories of Britain are not consistent, which is the difficulty. In addition, relevant British parties are deeply afraid that the Soviet Union may also have repercussions after Britain and Japan conduct negotiations, so it is clearly explained that future negotiations will not target any third country. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden recently answered questions from members in the Lower House, saying that the British government will take advantage of appropriate opportunities to consult with the governments of other countries that are most relevant in order to find out their opinions on concluding a Pacific non-aggression pact.

<h3>Japan's Fifth Batch of Gold to Be Shipped to the US Soon</h3>
<p>40 to 50 Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since March of this year, Japan's four shipments of gold to New York have been completed on the 23rd of this month, totaling approximately 210 million yen. According to a detailed investigation of Japan's international trade situation, approximately 80% of the goods imported in the first half of this year are raw materials, chemicals, machinery, and other necessities for the munitions industry, and the demand for the above-mentioned items is unlikely to decrease in the second half of this year. Even if the total number of import surpluses in this year can be offset by a larger number of exports and intangible income other than trade in the second half of this year, the number of offsets is not very large. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance is now planning to export gold for the fifth time in the near future, with a number of approximately 40 million or 50 million yen, and hopes that the total amount of gold exported this year will not exceed 250 million yen. However, it is extremely doubtful whether it can cover international payments and maintain the exchange rate of the Japanese yen. Even if the total amount of gold exports is limited to 250 million yen, the number has exceeded the highest amount of gold produced in Japan this year. (It is estimated that the highest amount of gold produced in Japan is 170 million or 180 million yen, so it has exceeded 80 million or 90 million yen.) Therefore, the seriousness of Japan's gold problem and the Japanese yen crisis is very obvious. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Develops Industry</h3>
<p>Submits Five-Year Plan Requiring 900 Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Army Ministry's five-year industrial plan has been submitted to the Planning Board, hoping the government will review it soon and implement it on schedule. The Army authorities, considering the plans for strengthening military equipment for the Army and Navy from Showa 13 to Showa 15 (1938-1940), have assessed the necessary extent of expanding production capacity and securing resources, and created this plan. Its numerical basis includes the following points:</p>
<p>㊀ Of the national defense plan from Showa 13 to 18 (1938-1943) (including the Army's six-year national defense preparation plan and the Navy's second supplementary plan), at least 5 billion yuan will be used for military industry. To consume this huge expenditure, the productive capacity of Japanese industry must be expanded to three times its current size. The estimated productive capacity of Japanese industry in Showa 11 (1936) was over 12 billion yuan, and by Showa 18 (1943), it must reach three times this level.</p>
<p>㊁ For national defense purposes, the productive capacity to be expanded should focus on heavy industry and the chemical industry. In the first half of the five-year plan, a foundation will be laid for a major shift from light industry to heavy industry. During this period, various machines necessary for the development of the aviation industry, automobile industry, and shipbuilding industry will be prepared, and the raw materials needed but in short supply must be imported from abroad. Therefore, import surpluses will be unavoidable for the next two to three years.</p>
<p>㊂ Calculate the total quantity of necessary materials and military supplies for national defense produced each year, and clearly indicate the limits for cultivating productive capacity. The Army, in the first half of its twelve-year national defense preparation plan (six years), will prepare operational materials, improve equipment, and complete its national defense capabilities. The scope of expansion for the necessary productive capacity, raw materials, etc., has been calculated with specific figures. The above plan also includes the development of small and medium-sized commercial industries and the revitalization policies for agricultural, mountainous, and fishing villages. The total capital required for the entire plan is said to be 9 billion yuan. (24th, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japan Trains Technical Personnel</h3>
<p>Increases Specialized Classes</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Due to the active expansion of industrial productivity in various sectors, Japan is experiencing a significant shortage of mid-level technical personnel. Currently, there are a total of sixteen industrial vocational schools under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education nationwide, graduating approximately 2,500 students each year. The number of applications for new graduates received by these vocational schools this year from companies and factories is, on average, seven times higher than in normal years. The vocational school receiving the most applications has a record of twenty times more than usual. In view of this situation, the Ministry of Education is conducting as many trials as possible to increase the number of technical personnel. However, due to budget limitations, establishing new vocational schools is extremely difficult. Therefore, a plan has been proposed to increase the number of classes in each vocational school and expand the scope of elective courses in middle schools, encouraging middle school students to specialize in a particular skill, so that they can be employed after one year of training. This approach demonstrates the broad impact of expanding productivity and the unsuitability of existing institutions for the drastic expansion. (24th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japan's industrial sector, centered on the military supply industry, is quite active. Therefore, the Planning Board has decided to mobilize various agencies to train a large number of skilled workers, submit the plan during the special Diet session, and request approval of the necessary expenses. The Ministry of Home Affairs prepared the original proposal yesterday and submitted it to the Planning Board. The plan involves establishing training centers for apprentice workers in six major cities, providing various industrial training to graduates of higher elementary schools, and assigning them to factories to work after two to three months. According to this plan, 4,000 workers can be trained each year. (24th, Dōmei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Diplomat Recruitment Standards</h3>
<p>Must Have Type O Blood</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Dr. Tsunemasa Aragaki, a medical doctor and medical advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has requested the establishment of a medical bureau within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has also requested that future Japanese diplomats should preferably have Type O blood. He has submitted a memorial to the Minister of Foreign Affairs stating that blood type and personality are inherently consistent, as advocated by the German scholar Landsteiner. He recognized that blood could be divided into four types: A, B, AB, and O, and various countries are actively studying it. In particular, the leaders of virtually every organization tend to have Type O blood. Therefore, the doctor believes that putting aside other societies, Japanese diplomats, in order to ensure autonomous diplomacy, undertake burdensome tasks, and are in a fierce international arena, must possess this national treasure to succeed. The characteristics produced by Type O blood have many advantages, such as a calm mind, not swayed by emotions, not listening to people's words without thought, not being swayed by others, having decisiveness, a strong will, a gentle surface, and firm self-confidence. The above is just a brief summary, so if they are used as diplomats, they should be outstanding talents. (24th, Dōmei News Agency)</p>

<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<h3>Talking About the Konoe Cabinet (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Nanxue</p>
<p>This policy is roughly the same as the financial policy of Ketsu Yūki during the Hayashi cabinet. That is to say, the interests represented by them, the financial capital, belong to the same system. (However, Kaya's financial control is already a step further than Yūki's). Yoshino also supports this policy, which also explains the social relations represented by Yoshino.</p>
<p>The chaebol who wanted Baba to step down in the past were the chaebol who supported Yūki's rise. Kaya has a deeper relationship with Yūki, and he naturally had a disagreement with Baba. Baba was supported by the military, and Baba's appearance caused panic among most of the chaebol. The Konoe cabinet is advertised as "integrating the forces of all factions," but the forces of all factions are not easy to integrate.</p>
<p>As of today (June 8), the position of president of the Planning Board has been decided to be concurrently held by Foreign Minister Hirota. The opposition of some chaebol outside the cabinet, and the "united front" of Kaya and Yoshino within the cabinet, finally blocked Baba, preventing Baba from taking the chairman's seat.</p>
<p>Hirota in this new cabinet is said to have no factional color. But looking at his performance when he was prime minister, who can deny his relationship with the military and Baba? Now that he concurrently serves as president of the Planning Board, it is said that it can ease the "opposition" outside and inside the cabinet. But can he balance Kaya and Baba on one shoulder? This can be imagined from his past history.</p>
<p>Hirota is the original creator of the "Three Principles for China." His appointment to foreign affairs this time is very much related to China. Hirota's specific diplomatic policy has not yet been formally announced. But according to the records in the newspapers these days, a clue can be seen. The general idea is:</p>
<p>Break the bureaucratic secrecy of unilateralism and prevent the progress of diplomacy from being affected by political disputes. As for the fundamental policy of diplomacy, it is still no different from the statement he made when he took office as foreign minister in 1934. The main content of that statement was: "During the period of national leap forward, it is natural that it cannot maintain balance with other countries, and international difficulties will naturally occur. If you want to hinder this leap forward because of this, it will disrupt world peace." According to this, it can be known that Japan's diplomacy towards China in the future will still not be able to change their "Three Principles." It's just that it adapts to the situation in China, and uses various methods to implement it openly or secretly.</p>
<p>In addition, Minister of Colonial Affairs Ohtani Son and Minister of Education Yasui Yūji are relatively close to Konoe in the new cabinet and do not have their own factions. As for Arima Yoriyasu (Minister of Agriculture), Nakajima Chikuhei, Nagai Ryūtarō, Shiono Suehiko (Minister of Justice), and Kazami Akira (Chief Cabinet Secretary), it is known to everyone that the frenzy of the new party movement may be launched by them.</p>
<p>According to the Army and Navy's new plan for strengthening national defense, and the implementation costs of the "reform policy"...etc., next year's budget will be at least between 3.5 and 3.6 billion. Konoe, of course, knew this, and Finance Minister Kaya must have known it already. The heavy pressure on the lives of the Japanese masses is only getting heavier. The so-called "easing domestic opposition" did not include the masses in this "opposition." The Japanese female writer Hirabayashi Taiko said it well! "The establishment of the Konoe cabinet is the strengthening of Japanese reactionary politics."</p>
<p>The policy network of the new cabinet was originally said to break the convention and be drafted by the Prime Minister himself. But later it was decided to only announce the policies that should be implemented from time to time, and not make any formal statement. Although this is based on the fact that previous cabinets often spoke but did not act, from another perspective, it is enough to have the meaning of "holding a pipa, half covering the face."</p>

<h3>Germany Only Withdraws from Surveillance, Does Not Retaliate Against Spain</h3>
<p>British Circles Are Relieved, But Aftermath of Surveillance System Is Difficult, Britain and France Study Partial Blockade</p>
<p>[London] British circles believe that Germany's withdrawal from the Spanish maritime surveillance plan is a welcome solution to the stalemate caused by the four countries' failure to properly handle the attack on the German warship. Londoners are relieved that no retaliation issues have arisen from beginning to end. It is believed that some German warships will still be stationed near the Spanish coast to protect German shipping, and Italy, following Germany's lead in withdrawing from the surveillance plan, will also take the same action. In the future, the British and French fleets will expand their scope of activity to the entire Spanish coastline, or invite other member states of the Non-Intervention Committee to participate in this surveillance work. Although Germany and Italy have declared their withdrawal from the surveillance plan, they will remain in the Non-Intervention Committee and still abide by the non-intervention agreement. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Although British Foreign Secretary Eden said that Germany's actions were limited to this after Germany withdrew from the Spanish maritime surveillance plan, observers here are still somewhat concerned about Germany's attitude, and consider the following two facts difficult to explain: (1) The areas supervised by German and Italian warships are the ports belonging to the Spanish government army. The move to withdraw from the surveillance plan is beneficial to the Spanish Republican government. Why is this? (2) Although Germany declared that it did not intend to take any direct action against the Spanish Republican government, the purpose of the country's warships moving to the Mediterranean Sea at this time is unclear. In addition, German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop has hurriedly returned to his country. What is the purpose of this trip? Speculation abounds. Some observers even worry that Germany may continue to send a large number of volunteers to Spain to help in the war, and that the relationship between Germany and the Czech Republic may become strained. As for the initial impact that may be caused by the withdrawal of Germany and Italy from the surveillance plan, it is generally believed that there are three possibilities in the future: (1) The maritime surveillance work undertaken by German and Italian warships may be carried out by British and French warships, with British warships responsible for the Mediterranean coast and French warships responsible for the Atlantic coast. (2) The London Adjustment Committee may entrust other naval countries to undertake the surveillance work abandoned by Germany and Italy. (3) Or Italy will simply abolish the maritime surveillance system. It is said that Foreign Secretary Eden once said in a speech in the House of Commons that since the implementation of the non-intervention policy is difficult to satisfy, the United Kingdom may have the possibility of reconsidering coping methods, which may be the so-called abolition of the maritime surveillance system. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] The British government is currently carefully considering the situation caused by Germany and Italy's withdrawal from the naval surveillance plan. The British government is studying with the French government the problem of sealing the gaps that have occurred due to the withdrawal of Germany and Italy from the Spanish East Coast, but without the approval of the Non-Intervention Committee, no resolution will be reached. At the same time, news of Italian troops landing in Malaga and major activities of German warships in the Mediterranean Sea are not believed here. British Foreign Secretary Eden declared in the House of Commons today that British warships performing patrol duties in the Malaga area have not reported any Italian troop landings, and the information obtained by the British Navy Department has not corroborated the rumors of German warship actions. (Central News Agency, 24th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The situation arising from Germany and Italy's withdrawal from the Spanish maritime surveillance plan has become the subject of exchanges of views between Britain and France. French Ambassador Corbin visited British Foreign Secretary Eden this morning, presumably for this purpose. What needs to be clarified most urgently is whether the surveillance plan can continue to be implemented under the current circumstances, and whether the German and Italian governments really want to directly carry out surveillance in the waters of the ports belonging to the Spanish army. Diplomatic circles here believe that if there is no possibility of continuing to promote non-intervention measures, it is better to recognize the two parties involved in the civil war as belligerent groups, and each country publicly declares that it will maintain neutrality. In other words, it recognizes that a state of war has already occurred. As a result, each country can, in the capacity of a neutral country, allow its citizens to supply the two sides in the Spanish civil war with military supplies or go to help in the capacity of volunteers, without favoring any side. British diplomatic circles also said that this is only recognizing the current facts in law. In short, the Adjustment Committee should hold a meeting within the shortest possible time to decide on the issue of its own survival. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the situation caused by the German cruiser Leipzig incident, it has been learned that British Ambassador to Germany Henderson declared to German Foreign Minister Neurath in Berlin yesterday that if the German government takes any violent action in the Mediterranean, it will be regarded as an extremely serious situation in British eyes. Neurath immediately replied that Germany's actions are often limited to withdrawing from Spanish maritime surveillance. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] According to reliable sources today, British Ambassador to France Phipps told French Foreign Minister Delbos that Britain is prepared to prevent the Leipzig incident from becoming a prairie fire with all its strength. The French Foreign Minister replied that he agreed. (23rd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] According to the Daily Express, the British Ambassador to Germany notified German Foreign Minister Neurath today that if Germany takes military retaliation against the Spanish government for the Leipzig incident, Britain will consider it to have created a serious situation. (24th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] After Germany withdrew from the surveillance plan, it was rumored that U.S. Ambassador Dodd had made some suggestions to German Foreign Minister Neurath on the Spanish issue. The U.S. Embassy has categorically denied this. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that he had received a letter from the Spanish National Army authorities, stating various reasons and requesting recognition as a belligerent group. The British government is considering it, but does not intend to immediately change its attitude towards this matter. He also received a letter responding to the British protest regarding the British warship Hunter being bombed by a submarine, claiming that the British warship touched a mine buried in territorial waters. This statement is clearly different from the facts reported by the Hunter. The British Foreign Office is currently considering response steps. The previous protest letter reserved the issue of demanding compensation for losses and consoling the deceased crew members. The British government has asked General Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Army, to pay attention to the Hague Convention, which prohibits the burying of mines outside the enemy's port in order to block commercial navigation. Regarding the National Army's detention of British ship goods, the British Ambassador to Spain is urging the National Army authorities to explain their behavior of unloading the goods loaded on British ships and transporting them inland. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Germany Adopts a Policy of Advancing and Retreating</h3>
<p>Did Not Withdraw from the Non-Intervention Committee, But Has Reserved the Right to Act Freely</p>
<p>[Berlin] Germany will not temporarily withdraw from the Non-Intervention Committee, which has been confirmed by well-informed sources here. It is said that Germany only withdrew from the maritime surveillance plan and restored the freedom of action when German warships were attacked. The German government's attitude has been explained during a brief conversation between German Foreign Minister Neurath and British Ambassador Hunter today, and can also be seen in British Foreign Secretary Eden's report to the House of Commons. (23rd, National Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop sent a note to the British Foreign Office yesterday on Germany's withdrawal from Spanish naval surveillance. Today, the semi-official German News Agency gave a detailed explanation of Germany's attitude. The statement stated:</p>
<p>1. Germany, unlike other countries, has no dispute with the Spanish people in the past and present, and has never participated in the historical conquest of Spanish territory. The German people and government, in addition to expressing deep sympathy for Spain's suffering from internal strife, only hope that Spain will restore its independence and freedom as soon as possible. Germany has no ambition to turn Spain into an administrative province or a zone of national socialism, except for its economic and cultural relations with Spain. The German government's decision to withdraw from international maritime surveillance at this time is to enable German ships to restore their complete freedom of action if they are attacked. This attitude has been explained in detail by German Foreign Minister Neurath to British Ambassador to Germany Henderson today.</p>
<p>2. Germany's attitude towards the Spanish civil strife from beginning to end is "The Spanish civil strife is limited to Spaniards." In other words, it opposes any foreign political, financial, and military intervention. However, this concept has obviously not been agreed to by certain democratic countries. Volunteers and military supplies are pouring in from Moscow. However, the National Army is still gaining the upper hand. Therefore, people in democratic countries believe that if they accept the opinions of Germany and Italy in the Non-Intervention Committee, they are afraid that they will not be able to contain the National Army and secretly help the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>3. Although the German government still declares that if the Non-Intervention Committee can guarantee complete fairness, Germany is prepared to cooperate. Therefore, Germany participated in the surveillance measures. Unexpectedly, this measure completely failed. The supply of Bolshevik volunteers and military supplies is still endless.</p>
<p>4. The Valencia authorities in Spain wanted to undermine the four-nation surveillance plan and carried out "criminal attacks" on ships from Britain, Italy, and Germany, resulting in the "Deutschland" incident. The German government believes that since the Non-Intervention Committee and the Surveillance Committee cannot make any concrete decisions, it believes it is necessary to take retaliation. Retaliation cannot compensate for the loss, but it gives the Spanish government a lesson in the hope that the same thing will not happen again. Therefore, there is the four-nation agreement of June 12.</p>
<p>5. At that time, Germany ordered the ships participating in the surveillance to immediately open fire if attacked by the Spanish government fleet or aircraft, and the Spanish government changed to attacking with submarines. The correctness of the facts has been guaranteed by the German naval authorities and the German government.</p>
<p>6. According to the June 12 agreement, it was submitted to other countries monitoring the Spanish coast for joint discussion, requesting immediate joint resistance measures.</p>
<p>7. The British and French governments do not believe the reports of the members of the Adjustment Committee's surveillance team, but insist on the need for a thorough investigation of the facts based on Valencia's denial. The German government finds this very difficult to accept.</p>
<p>8. But in order to seek agreement with maximum effort, the German government cancelled any proposals for actual retaliation in yesterday's London talks, and only requested immediate joint demonstrations to show a warning. In addition, the investigation requested by the British and French governments can also be carried out at the same time.</p>
<p>9. The British and French governments still refused such a gentle and backward request. Therefore, the June 12 agreement is not only a mere document, but directly harmful to the German government. In order to protect its own interests, it has decided to withdraw from the surveillance mechanism. It is very pleased with the complete agreement of the Italian government's views. (22nd, National Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German Foreign Traffic News generally summarized Germany's attitude towards the international situation, stating that the collective mechanism lacks a spirit of unity regarding the Leipzig incident. Germany feels disappointed but not surprised, because the experience after the Great War proves that the sincerity of fair judgment on international events is still lacking. The German government's efforts to end the war in Spain as soon as possible and avoid causing a European war have not diminished. (23rd, National Haitong Telegram)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador Leaves Britain to Return Home</h3>
<p>Meets with Hitler</p>
<p>[Berlin] German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop flew back to Berlin from London last night on a special plane. Political circles here believe that Ribbentrop's sudden return to China is to report to Führer Hitler on the new situation after the breakdown of the London Four-Nation Conference talks and the repercussions caused by Germany's withdrawal from international maritime surveillance. (24th, National Haitong Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italy and Germany Collude</h3>
<p>Deny Sending Troops to Spain</p>
<p>[London] Italian Ambassador Grandi recently sent a note to Foreign Secretary Eden, the content of which is as follows: "After the surveillance warships in Spanish waters suffered accidents, the four countries of Britain, France, Germany and Italy should have a spirit of solidarity in order to reach a joint action. However, the recent talks by the representatives of the respective countries have proven that this spirit does not exist. The Italian government deeply regrets this, and hereby confirms its withdrawal from the maritime surveillance plan." (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Rome] Other well-informed sources recently declared that if the areas previously monitored by German and Italian warships are replaced by the British and French navies, they will be opposed. The Italian government is currently considering whether to intercept ships from other countries carrying volunteers or military supplies to the Spanish government army with Italian warships. As for whether Italy will participate if Germany takes retaliatory measures against the Spanish Republican government in the future, it is unknown. However, according to official sources, the political axis of Berlin-Rome will still maintain its ties. It is also said that Italy seems to be attending the London Adjustment Committee and continuing to abide by the various restrictions contained in the non-intervention agreement, but on the condition that other countries also abide by it.

The Nationalist forces have already occupied two villages along the main road from Bilbao to Santander, located about 12 miles west of Bilbao. General Davila, the commander of the Nationalist northern forces, has deployed over 65,000 troops, along with 400 cannons and hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles, to attack the port of Santander. It is estimated that approximately 70,000 refugees from Bilbao have already fled to Santander. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Future of the Franc</h3>
<p>Many Rumors Regarding Devaluation</p>
<p>[Paris] Before the new Finance Minister Bonnet returns from Washington, rumors are rampant about how he will rescue the financial crisis. Some say the government plans to devalue the franc before Bonnet returns, exceeding the level permitted last year. However, others feel the government will not take such a drastic measure. At the same time, it is also said that the devaluation of the franc is merely a temporary expedient with no real value.  It is also heard from well-informed sources that after Bonnet returns, he plans to devalue the franc to the level of 1926, making the ratio of the franc to the pound sterling 124 francs per pound.

<h3>French Political Situation Temporarily Eases</h3>
<p>Parliament Welcomes the New Cabinet</p>
<p>[Paris] After the formation of the Chautemps cabinet yesterday, it is scheduled to attend both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies for the first time on the 29th of this month. According to impressions from the Chamber of Deputies' lounge, the majority of the deputies have expressed their welcome to the Chautemps cabinet. For example, when the delegation of various left-wing parties in the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting this afternoon, they passed a motion proposed by Socialist Deputy Lucien, stating, "The new cabinet has decided to rely on the majority party of the Popular Front as its backing and continue to promote the Popular Front's platform. We will naturally support it." As for the Senate lounge, it also expressed relief that the cabinet crisis was quickly resolved. The new Premier has a long-standing reputation in the Senate, and the continued appointments of Daladier as Minister of National Defense, Delbos as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Ambassador to the United States Bonnet as Minister of Finance are especially endorsed by the senators. In short, the tense atmosphere of the past few days has now eased. (Havas, Central News Agency, 24th)</p>

<h3>Jiangsu High Court to Continue Hearing the Case of Shen Junru and Others Today</h3>
<p>Public Attendance Still Prohibited Except for Family Members; Shen and Others Request Investigation of Evidence</p>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: The Jiangsu High Court's Second Criminal Division is scheduled to continue hearing the case of Shen Junru and others, who are accused of endangering the Republic of China, at 5:00 AM today (the 15th). The defendants' family members arrived in succession yesterday afternoon (the 24th) and are staying at the Railway Hotel. Fifteen defense lawyers have also arrived in Suzhou one after another. Family members and lawyers were busy visiting the detention center yesterday to see Shen and the others. The High Court did not issue any public attendance tickets for this case yesterday. Except for family members and journalists, public attendance is still prohibited during the court session.</p>
<p>Shen Junru and others submitted a petition to the High Court at 5:00 PM yesterday (the 24th) requesting an investigation of evidence. It stated, in brief: "Regarding the case in which the defendants are accused of endangering the Republic of China, during the hearing on the 11th of this month, the defendants and their defense lawyers presented over 20 points of evidence that should be investigated, based on the facts listed in the indictment. However, Judge Fang and others rejected all of them without giving any reasons. The defendants believed that this was biased and requested recusal. Now that we have received a summons to continue the hearing on the 25th of this month, and another judge has been appointed to preside over the trial, it is clear that Judge Fang and others have recused themselves because the defendants' request for recusal was deemed to be justified, or that the High Court believes that Judge Fang and others should have recused themselves because they did not investigate the evidence requested by the defendants. Therefore, regarding the 20-odd points of evidence that were previously requested to be investigated, except for the exhibits that have been submitted in the case, which will be investigated in court during the renewed hearing on the 23rd, the exhibits that could not be submitted and the witnesses who should be summoned or entrusted to be questioned before the trial date, we request that the High Court take measures to collect, summon, or entrust them in accordance with the provisions of Article 253 of the Criminal Procedure Law (remainder omitted)."</p>
<p>In addition, the seven individuals, including Shen Junru, have hired more than 20 defense lawyers. However, the defense brief submitted the other day, which consisted of tens of thousands of words, was drafted by the Tianjin Lawyers Association and Zhang Zhirang and other lawyers from this city. After being approved by the major lawyers, it was submitted to the High Court.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army in North China Strives to Strengthen its Organization</h3>
<p>Young Officers Suddenly Publicize "September 18th" Eve Theory; New Commander is Okamura, who Signed the Tanggu Truce; Entire Army Holds Drills to Seize Tianjin, Beijing, Tongzhou, and Fengtai</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The talk of strengthening the Japanese Army in North China has been circulating for nearly a month and is about to materialize. Under the Chief of Staff, the Army originally had Sections 1, 2, and 3. It is now planned to add a "Section 4" in July. The head of Section 1, since being transferred back to his country after Ryōden was appointed, is only temporarily being managed by the Army staff officer Oboki. After the future changes, Oboki and the current head of Section 2, Kazuchi, will switch positions. The head of Section 3, Ikeda, will remain unchanged. It has been decided that the newly added Section 4 will be headed by Nagamine Yoshi, who is currently an attached member of the Army. The deputy head of Section 2, Sentada, will return to his position as a staff officer at the Kwantung Army Headquarters, serving as a liaison officer between the Kwantung and North China Army Headquarters. The commander of the Japanese Army in North China, Tashiro Kan'ichiro, has been in command for over a year and is due for a transfer. Therefore, there has recently been talk of him returning to his country to take on another position and being replaced by Okamura Yasuji, the commander of the 2nd Division stationed in Sendai. If this happens, it will be before the official announcement of the regular changes in the Japanese Army in mid-July. Okamura's arrival is expected in early August.</p>
<p>The younger officers in the Japanese Army Headquarters in North China have recently been publicizing the theory of preparing for the eve of the second "September 18th Incident," provoking their expatriates and their military leaders. This has led the Japanese High Command to believe that enriching the content of the North China Garrison Army and strengthening its organization is a prerequisite for wartime preparation and an urgent task. Furthermore, they are concerned that a genuine Jiidong organization does exist in North China and that the Tanggu Truce may be destroyed. The Central Army is about to approach the Great Wall and station troops there, putting pressure on the border of the puppet state of Manchukuo. Therefore, the purpose of replacing Tashiro with Okamura as the commander of the North China Garrison Army is because Okamura was the signatory of the Tanggu Truce, and his use of the treaty will be more flexible than anyone else's. Also, because Okamura has an old relationship with Tojo, the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, communication will be easier and closer. Before the regular changes in the Japanese Army in the spring of March, there was a proposal for Okamura to replace Tashiro, but it was not realized due to various reasons. Now, it has finally come to fruition.</p>
<p>The Japanese Garrison Army in North China is scheduled to hold a three-day large-scale military exercise from June 25th to 27th, with two days of camping. During the exercise, the four locations of Beijing, Tianjin, Tongzhou, and Fengtai will be the key fortresses to be seized. The Japanese troops stationed in Qinhuangdao, Yushuguan, Luanzhou, and Changli, east of Tangshan, will gather in Tangshan starting from the 24th, adopt an offensive posture, and attack Tianjin and Beijing. The Japanese troops stationed in Beijing and Tongzhou will gather in Fengtai starting from the 24th, defend the area, and adopt a defensive posture. Approximately 4,000 to 5,000 troops will participate. On the 22nd, over 400 Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin departed for Nanda Temple, serving as the main force for the future offensive. Tashiro will serve as the director-general on the day of the exercise. The commander of the Japanese Army Brigade stationed in Beijing, Kawabe, and the commanders of the 1st and 2nd Infantry Regiments, Mutaguchi and Kayashima, and the commander of the Artillery Regiment, Suzuki, will serve as commanders. On the 22nd, Tashiro originally planned to inspect the troops in Tongzhou, but he suddenly fell ill and sent the Chief of Staff Hashimoto instead. On the final day of the large-scale military exercise, the troops will gather at Babaoshan in western Beijing to hold a military parade, with Tashiro leading Kazuchi, Asai, and Adachi as inspecting officers. To handle this exercise, the Army Headquarters established a temporary large-scale military exercise operations section within the Japanese concession's military officers' club last week, with the Army staff officers Tsukada and Adachi and attached member Suzuki drafting the agenda for implementation.

<h3>Newly Defined Ratio Between National Currency and Guangdong Currency</h3>
<p>From New Year's Day Next Year, Guangdong Will Use National Currency as its Standard; Current Market Prices Have Not Yet Returned to Normal</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Song Ziwen's trip south represents the central government's inspection of the financial situation in Guangdong province and considers the need to reduce the ratio between the national currency and the Guangdong currency. Therefore, after arriving in Guangdong, he immediately consulted with the military and political authorities, including Yu Hanmou and Wu Tiecheng, and convened a meeting with the financial community to solicit information on the current financial situation in Guangdong province. After comprehensively considering the reports from all parties, on the afternoon of the 20th, in the form of an order from the Ministry of Finance, he officially announced the measures to reform the monetary system in Guangdong province. From today, the ratio between the national currency and the Guangdong Hao-yuan currency will be re-specified as 144 (ie 144 yuan of Guangdong Hao-yuan currency is equal to 100 yuan of national currency). From the 21st, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will successively redeem Guangdong Hao-yuan currency with national currency at the above legal ratio and destroy it, with the aim of completely recovering the Guangdong Hao-yuan currency within half a year. From New Year's Day next year, all public and private funds, commercial trade, and all transactions will be based on the national currency and will use the silver dollar currency. When announcing these measures, Song also convened more than 20 leaders of the Guangdong financial community at the Central Bank to declare the Ministry of Finance's four key points for reorganizing Guangdong's finances and reforming the monetary system: ㊀ Starting from January 1, 1938, all public and private funds in Guangdong province, as well as all sales transactions and payments, and the signing of various contracts, should be based on the national currency. If Hao-yuan currency is used for payment or agreements are signed, it will be invalid under the law. ㊁ The Guangdong Provincial Bank and the Guangzhou Municipal Bank have issued a total of 33,784,900 yuan in Hao-yuan currency as of June 19th of this year. From June 21st, it will be converted into national currency at a statutory ratio of 144, and it will continue to be used as usual at this ratio before the end of this year, but the national currency must not be refused at the statutory ratio, otherwise, severe penalties will be imposed. ㊂ The Guangdong Provincial Bank and the Guangzhou Municipal Bank will be responsible for redeeming and destroying the Hao-yuan currency issued by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Guangdong Provincial Bank at the statutory ratio from today. ㊃ The Guangzhou Branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee should maintain the original proportion of cash reserve for the Hao-yuan currency that has not yet been recovered at any time. The method for implementing the reform of the monetary system in Guangdong province is as follows: The Guangzhou Branch of the Issuance Reserve Committee shall not increase the total amount of Hao-yuan currency issued in Guangdong province after announcing 337,849,000 yuan. From June 21st, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank will redeem Hao-yuan currency and send it to the Issuance Reserve Branch for transfer every day. The cash reserve will be transferred to the accounts of each bank by the branch based on the actual cash composition in the vault. The guarantee reserve should be supplemented by public bonds for the reorganization of Guangdong's finances. The cash that has not been transferred should be the reserve for the actual circulation of Hao-yuan currency in the market, and the Issuance Reserve Branch will be responsible for its safekeeping. The Hao-yuan currency redeemed by the Provincial Bank will be sent to the Central Bank branch every day for collection and transfer to the Issuance Reserve Committee. The Issuance Reserve Committee will cut off the corners of the redeemed Hao-yuan currency after the announcement and send it to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for verification and reporting. After the above measures were announced, the provincial government, the municipal government, the bandit suppression headquarters, and the Department of Finance will draft and issue a notice on the above-mentioned measures stipulated by the Ministry of Finance so that all sectors of society can be informed. Before the announcement of the new ratio, although the market exchange rates for Hong Kong and Shanghai dollars fluctuated slightly, the exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars was 508 (ie 100 Hong Kong dollars was equal to 150.08 yuan of Guangdong currency), and the exchange rate for Shanghai dollars was 482 (ie 100 Hong Kong dollars was equal to 148.1 yuan of Guangdong currency). After the new ratio for the currency exchange rates of Hong Kong and Shanghai dollars was announced, the exchange rate for Shanghai dollars suddenly dropped to below 44, and the exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars also fell to a little over 49. After this reform of the monetary system, after the 20th, the city's banks no longer publicly quoted prices for Hong Kong and Shanghai dollars, fearing that the government would crack down on currency trading, and only relied on off-market transactions. On the 22nd, the exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars was about 480.08 yuan, and the exchange rate for Shanghai dollars was 44 yuan. As for the prices of goods in this province, after the new ratio of 144 was set, the Guangdong value increased slightly, and the price of imported grain and rice decreased slightly. However, other than that, the prices of various goods have not yet fallen slightly. (June 22nd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Reaction to Change of Education Bureau Director</p>
<p>The provincial government's committee meeting on the 22nd decided to transfer Chen Gui'er, the director of the local education bureau, to Taicang, and appointed Xiong Zhugao to fill the vacancy. Upon hearing the news, the local gentry and education community believed that the local education system, based on the spirit of autonomy for more than 30 years, had achieved its current state, and it was inappropriate to appoint someone unfamiliar with the local area to direct the administration. Therefore, on the 24th, more than 10 gentry members, including Min Ruizhi, Zhang Yunhe, Zhang Shutong, and Chen Qiushi, jointly telegraphed Chairman Chen of the provincial government and Director Zhou of the education department, requesting them to withdraw the order in order to maintain the status quo. It is also reported that various overseas hometown associations have unanimously expressed the same view.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Strict Water and Land Police to Prevent Lake Bandits</p>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent robbery cases in Taihu, Yangcheng Lake, and other areas. Upon hearing the news, the local water and land police authorities, considering that it is currently summer and reeds are growing everywhere along Taihu Lake, and that lake bandits are likely to take the opportunity to become active, have separately ordered their subordinates to take strict precautions in order to maintain local security.</p>
<p>Suzhou to Establish a General Municipality</p>
<p>Suzhou established a General Municipality five years ago, with the municipal government and the Wuxian County government located in the city. Later, after the provincial government considered that the existing administrative facilities of the county government were sufficient to cope with everything, it abolished the municipality in order to save expenses. In recent years, Suzhou's municipal facilities have developed rapidly, surpassing all other counties in Jiangnan. Now, the provincial government is planning to establish a municipality in Suzhou again and has sent personnel to Suzhou to inspect and plan. It will be submitted to the next provincial government meeting for discussion and decision. However, the people of Suzhou do not hope for its realization, because they believe that the establishment of a municipality will increase the burden on the people.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Changing Silkworm Silk Management</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silkworm Silk Control Association, in order to change the control management method in view of the imminent arrival of the Xia Lan season in various counties, has begun to recruit merchants to register to purchase Lan seeds and has also ordered the management of Lan trade throughout the province to purchase Lan seeds to be submitted to the provincial government for approval.</p>
<p>Power Plant Wholesale Electricity</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Power Plant is one of the largest power plants run by Chinese people. Recently, the three power plants in Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Xiashi, due to insufficient original power, had a joint proposal to build a new power plant. However, due to the high cost involved, funds are still needed to be raised. Later, it was learned that the Hangzhou Power Plant was willing to lay lines to wholesale electricity, so they changed their approach to contact the Hangzhou Power Plant. It is said that negotiations have been completed and a contract has been signed stipulating that the three power plants in Jiaxing and other places will purchase electricity wholesale from the Hangzhou Power Plant and transfer it to the use of each user. It has now been submitted to the主管official agency for record. It is estimated that this transmission line can be completed and energized within one year.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Dredging the Canal Section in the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>The project to dredge the canal section in the provincial capital of Zhenjiang-Danyang Canal was completed the day before yesterday. The Provincial Government Construction Department sent personnel to inspect and accept it and reported it truthfully. It was reported that the small gate at Yuan Zhaoguan's office had a deepened riverbed, a shaky foundation, and was inevitably dangerous. Therefore, it was demolished yesterday. In order to control the water flow, the authorities decided to add a steel and concrete gate in the river at the mouth of the small gate in the second half of the year. On the one hand, in order to facilitate traffic, a wooden bridge will be built south of Zhongshan Bridge using the remaining wood and stone. The width will be able to allow cars to pass, and construction will begin today and is scheduled to be completed by the end of July. Before the completion of Ximen Bridge and the above-mentioned wooden bridge, the Pingzheng Bridge and the dams built along the river will not be demolished for the time being in order to facilitate work.</p>
<p>Repair of Embankment Slope Completed</p>
<p>The embankment slope project on the east and west dikes of the Inner Canal was undertaken and repaired by the Jiangbei Canal Construction Bureau this year. Beforehand, all the gates on the east and west dikes were opened to lower the water level of the Inner Canal in order to facilitate construction. A total of 29 sections, starting from Baoying to Xiazhuang in the north and ending near Zhaoguan Dam in Jiangdu in the south, have been completed. It is now known that this project has been completed across the board and has been submitted to the provincial government to be examined and inspected by the Construction Department to complete the matter.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>

The provincial government of Jiangsu and the Second District Commissioner's Office were informed the other day to send personnel to supervise the oath-taking, and various agencies and groups were invited to observe the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Requesting Exemption from Dismissal of Security Team</p>
<p>Various companies and firms in Jiaxing County, because the provincial government ordered the dismissal of self-funded teams, the security team in this county is also within the scope of the dismissal. However, this team is a self-defense organization in Quanhe. The team members are all current shop assistants who assist the military police in investigating bandits and have made great contributions. Moreover, Jiayi is close to Taihu Lake, and a self-defense organization of merchants and residents is truly indispensable. On the 24th, they jointly requested the provincial and county governments to approve the continued retention or reorganization.</p>
<p>Asking to Open Deliberations on Tax Increase</p>
<p>The preliminary investigation of business tax for Jiaxing's various businesses has been completed. The Provincial Department has now sent personnel to the county for review. However, the review committee members are imposing additional taxes regardless of the facts. The various businesses are now requesting Lu Chujue, the supervisory committee member of the County Chamber of Commerce, to uphold justice. Supervisor Lu has sent a letter to the Business Tax Bureau of the Third District requesting it to convene a business tax deliberation meeting to openly deliberate based on legal principles and facts in order to comply with fairness.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Health Experiment Zone Epidemic Prevention</p>
<p>The Nantong Health Experiment Zone will designate the urban and rural areas as an absolute immunity zone, widely administering vaccinations, and establishing health offices in Rugao Matang Fengli and other places.

<p>Wheat Prices Suddenly Soar</p>
<p>When new wheat was launched on the grain market outside the South Gate of this county, it was sold for more than seven yuan per stone.

On the 22nd, No. 1 Huxi wheat reached nine yuan per stone, and Huidong wheat also reached eight yuan and four jiao. The trend is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Yuyao</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Due to Regional Disputes</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce and the Zhouxing Town Chamber of Commerce have had repeated disputes due to regional issues. They have telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, requesting it to determine the boundaries in order to avoid disputes. The Ministry of Industry then consulted the Provincial Government to order the County Government to investigate and handle the matter. After receiving the order, the County Government sent a letter to the County Party Headquarters, scheduling a joint meeting of both parties at 1:00 PM on July 2nd to discuss the boundary demarcation method.</p>

<h3>Transactions in the Cotton Yarn Exchange Market Decrease</h3>
<p>Near and Far Term Reduced by More Than Three Times; Account Checking Procedures Can Be Completed Today</p>
<p>The 42 brokers penalized at the Cotton Yarn Exchange Market all stopped trading for three days starting yesterday morning.

Yesterday, there were 17 yarn and flower merchants, 1 yarn merchant, and 7 flower merchants operating as usual in the market. After the auction started at 9:30 AM, the agents standing around the wooden railing in the market were few and far between. Until the market closed, the exchange's management department estimated that the total turnover of near and far term contracts was about 15,000 bales, a decrease of more than three times compared to normal. From the opening to the closing of the market yesterday morning, the spot price of cotton yarn rose more than three yuan above the closing price of the previous day, the far term price rose 1.56 yuan, the spot price of cotton rose 0.35 yuan, and the far term price rose 0.156 yuan. As for the thorough inspection of accounts by personnel sent by the YUAN and department, all account books and slips of various brokers, as well as bank and money shop ledgers, have been sealed and will be investigated in detail day by day. These procedures can be completed today.</p>
<h3>Flour Exchange Limits Total Amount</h3>
<p>Refuses to Allow Non-Industry People to Trade; Market Prices Tend to Stabilize</p>
<p>After the market price of flour soared on the Shanghai Flour Exchange, the Minister of Industry issued a hand order (already seen in yesterday's newspaper) to investigate the brokers' association. At 9:10 AM yesterday morning, an ad hoc meeting was convened, chaired by the president, Zhang Weiyun, to report the purpose of the meeting. Then, the chairman of the exchange, Du Yuesheng, read out the hand order of Minister Wu, saying that the purpose of establishing the Flour Exchange was to level the market price and regulate the people's food, and that each broker had a great responsibility and should be severely punished for violating the Exchange Law. Everyone should follow the points in Minister Wu's hand order and solemnly accept customer commissions for buying and selling, etc. Then, the director, Gu Xinyi, reported briefly. The brokers decided to abide by Minister Wu's hand order and adjourned at about 10:00 AM. Therefore, the rise and fall in the morning and afternoon market were mixed and seemed stable. However, the total turnover decreased sharply because of the ban on non-industry people from trading and the order for each broker's daily total transaction amount to be limited to 50,000 quotes.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Notice: All Businesses in the City Must Join Trade Associations Promptly According to Law</h3>
<p>Otherwise, they will be subject to suspension of business.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to all companies and firms in the city that have not yet joined trade associations, urging them to join promptly according to the law. The notice stated: "It has been found that stores that have not joined trade associations should be ordered by their respective trade associations to join within a specified period. Those who fail to join after the deadline will be warned first, and if they still do not join, they will be reported to the competent authorities for punishment. In the third phase, they may be ordered to suspend business. This measure has been formulated by the Central Department of Civil Training and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for implementation. After receiving the order from the Social Bureau on June 17, the various trade associations in the city are formulating deadlines to urge members to join. The Chamber of Commerce is concerned that stores throughout the city may not be fully aware of this, and may neglect the trade associations' urging them to join. Therefore, it is issuing this notice again, urging everyone to pay attention to it."</p>

<h3>US New Maritime Industry Subsidy Act Impacts Chinese Sailors</h3>
<p>The Da Lai Company, which employs more than a thousand Chinese, has recently made major reductions and switched to American employees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that with the implementation of the new US Maritime Industry Subsidy Act, the Da Lai Company and other American postal ship companies will dismiss four or five hundred Chinese employees, many of whom have served for more than ten years. Even today, the Easterners employed by American postal ships are being drastically reduced, with only the most diligent and long-serving personnel being retained. The current subsidy system will expire on June 30, just six days from now. It is difficult to predict its future, whether the old system will continue to be implemented, or American ships will completely lose their subsidies pending the formulation of a new system. The future of American merchant ships now depends entirely on the decisions of President Roosevelt and Kennedy, the powerful chairman of the Maritime Commission. According to their statements, the United States will have an unparalleled merchant shipping industry, and plans are currently being drawn up to build hundreds of cargo and passenger ships. The new merchant ships will strive to use American personnel, and the government plans to advance huge sums of money, either in the form of subsidies or loans, to cover construction costs, provided that all American materials and labor are used. The committee has been investigating the operating expenses of shipping companies in other countries, and after the investigation is completed, it will allocate subsidies according to the difference between the American shipping companies and those of other countries, so as to compete with other countries. However, the investigation is proceeding slowly, because shipping companies in other countries are unwilling to disclose the amount of their operating expenses. The completely American plan will also be applied to the personnel employed on the ships. After the implementation of the new law, the number of foreign sailors may be reduced to 10 percent, and they must be qualified American citizens. Therefore, sailors who are Easterners will naturally be eliminated. The Da Lai Company alone previously employed more than a thousand Chinese, but has recently made major reductions. Currently, only room attendants and kitchen helpers remain on the ships, while the rest of the pursers and attendants have all been replaced by Americans. Their minimum monthly salary is US$80, while the monthly salary of Chinese people on Pacific passenger mail ships is only 23 Chinese dollars, and the ships of the Japan Mail Steamship Company pay 23 Japanese yen.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Exhibition Preparatory Office Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>In addition to holding commemorative ceremonies for the 10th anniversary of the municipal government, various exhibitions will be held. In order to enable the public to understand air defense knowledge and develop an interest in aviation, the Aviation Association will hold an air defense exhibition. In addition to displaying various aircraft, bombs, models, etc. owned by the association, it will also ask for the air defense exhibition equipment used in the Nanjing tour to be transported to Shanghai for exhibition. According to a report from the Shenzhou News Agency yesterday, the air defense exhibition will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium. The preparatory office was established yesterday, with Yu Hongjun as the director of the preparatory office and Pan Gongzhan as the deputy director. The preparatory work has begun, and the exhibits for the tour will be transported from Nanjing to Shanghai on July 1. It is said that the materials are very substantial.</p>
<h3>Xie Da Industrial Company Develops Sichuan Shipping</h3>
<p>Building Twelve New Ships to Operate Shanghai-Yichang-Chongqing Line</p>
<p>In recent years, the shipping industry on the Sichuan River has developed rapidly. Giants and business leaders from Shanghai and Sichuan have now formed a large shipping company dedicated to operating on the Sichuan River route, with strong capital and a grand scale, building a total of twelve new ships to develop shipping rights. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Election of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>The company is named Xie Da Industrial Co., Ltd. The founders are all giants from Shanghai and Sichuan, as well as leaders in the financial and business sectors. The general manager in Shanghai is Li Zukui, and in Sichuan are Hu Wenlan (formerly the Sichuan governor Hu Jingyi), Zhao Zisheng (chairman of the Sichuan Shipping Association), and Wen Shaohe (chairman of the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce). On the 20th of this month, the company convened an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to discuss business operations and elect directors and supervisors. At the meeting, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Sun Shubei, Li Zukui, Fan Zhongqu, Zhao Zisheng, Cheng Peimin, Huang Meisheng, Chen Zhongjiu, Hu Wenlan, Li Zumin, and others were elected as directors, and Zeng Ziwei, Tian Bailu, Zhang Zeshu, Jin Runxiang, and Wen Shaohe were elected as supervisors. Notification letters have been issued to invite the directors and supervisors to take office.</p>
<p>Subscription of Shares</p>
<p>When the extraordinary shareholders' meeting was convened, the shareholders in Shanghai who are in charge of operations and major affairs reported that the new articles of association of the company had been amended, and all the shareholders unanimously approved them after reading them. Next, it was reported that the company had increased its shares to expand its business, and the new shares had been fully subscribed from all sides. Furthermore, the shareholders discussed the development of shipping and the steps to be taken, and decided to implement the planned facilities.</p>
<p>Construction of New Ships</p>
<p>The company's shipping business operates on the Sichuan River route, including ⑴ direct routes from Shanghai to Chongqing, and ⑵ upstream routes from Yichang to Chongqing. Last month, at a cost of 350,000 yuan, the latest type of streamlined river ship was built in a Shanghai factory, named "Xie Qing." The ship's beautiful interior and the elegance of each guest seat are superior to other ships, and its speed is extremely strong. Since its launch, its business has been quite good, with freight revenue constantly exceeding 50,000 yuan per voyage. Therefore, two sister ships will be built in succession, identical to the Xie Qing, named ⑴ Xie Chang and ⑴ Xie Da. According to Mr. Li Zukui, general manager of the company, the construction of the Xie Chang ship is nearing completion and will soon be launched, and the Xie Da is also under construction. Both ships are suitable for navigation on the flood and shallow water sections of the Shanghai-Chongqing line, and will operate special express services to facilitate the transport of goods and passengers between Sichuan and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Business Development</p>
<p>Mr. Li also said that there is a plan to build a new ship named Xie Fu, which is about the same size as the previous ship, using the latest type of engine in the hope of creating a new record for Sichuan River shipping. Separately planned are two large iron barges for shallow and flood water, one named Xie Ping and the other Xie Long, for towing and transporting cargo during water shortages. In addition, there are the Xie He, Xie Kang, and Xie Fu ships, which are currently deployed on the Yichang-Chongqing route for transporting passengers and cargo. In total, the company's first step is to operate twelve new types of ships on the Sichuan River. In the future, new ships will be added as needed based on business operations. At this time when national ships on the Sichuan River are taking off, after Minsheng, there is now the rise of a large shipping company, which is truly good news for China's shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Xin Jiangtian and Ningxing Ships Collide, Each Submitting to the Shipping Bureau for Arbitration</h3>
<p>Although the facts are disputed, the cause is indeed the race to be first. Passengers are terrified and hope the authorities will severely punish the parties involved.</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Jiangtian ship and the Sanbei Shipping Company's Ningxing ship collided twice outside Zhenhai Port at 5:00 AM the day before yesterday. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and reported to the Shipping Administration Bureau, submitting to the Ship Collision Committee for arbitration. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Two Ships Collide</p>
<p>The Xin Jiangtian ship has a gross tonnage of 3,645 tons, and the Ningxing ship has a gross tonnage of 3,439 tons. Both ships operate exclusively on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. At 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, the two ships lifted anchor from Zhenhai Wharf and sailed to Ningbo. The Ningxing was in front, and the Xin Jiangtian was behind. Inside Zhenhai Port, the Xin Jiangtian wanted to overtake, but because there was a sailboat in the channel ahead, the stern of the Xin Jiangtian collided with the bow of the Ningxing. After the collision, both ships were damaged. However, because the damage was above the waterline, they continued to sail as normal. During parallel sailing, the two ships collided a second time due to the ebbing tide. Although the passengers were not injured, they were greatly frightened.</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai to Report</p>
<p>In the first collision, the iron plate of the fourth cabin of the Xin Jiangtian was broken, and the second cabin of the Ningxing was ruptured for two feet. In the second collision, the iron plate of the bow of the Xin Jiangtian was damaged, and the stern of the Ningxing was broken. Fortunately, both were above the waterline, so they continued to sail from Zhenhai to Ningbo as normal. Yesterday morning, the two ships arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo one after the other. The Xin Jiangtian docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf, and the Ningxing docked at Pier 16. Yang Honglin, the captain of the Xin Jiangtian, reported to General Manager Cai Zengji and the heads of the Shipping Business Department, while K.A.Möller, the captain of the Ningxing, reported to Manager Yu Shunmao. Both reports were written, each with their own reasons.</p>
<p>Shipping Bureau Arbitration</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company submitted the original report of Captain K.A.Möller to the Shipping Administration Bureau at 11:00 AM yesterday, requesting arbitration according to the law. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also submitted the report of Captain Yang Honglin to the Shipping Administration Bureau for review at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Shipping Administration Bureau decided to submit the reports of the two captains to the Ship Collision Committee for handling according to the law, and dispatched technicians to inspect the two ships. However, according to the reports of passengers on the two ships, the collision was indeed caused by the race to be the first to sail to Ningbo. Although fortunately there was no major disaster, the situation at the time was quite serious. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will strictly investigate the captains of the two ships to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Sailing to Ningbo as Normal</p>
<p>Because the damaged areas of the Xin Jiangtian and Ningxing were all above the waterline, there was no danger to navigation, and both ships were regular scheduled ships, so they continued to sail while repairing the damage. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the two ships still sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo as normal.</p>
<h3>Party Department Sends Representatives to Urge Silk Factory Workers to Resume Work</h3>
<p>After the workers of the Baohua, Wanbao, and other silk factories on Bailinan Road in western Shanghai demanded that the authorities release the arrested workers and went on strike, representatives from the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau went to urge them to follow the orders of the party and government and return to work in the factory on a designated date.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Disaster Relief Research Association Bitterly Condemns the Harsh and Brutal Sichuan Government</h3>
<p>Telegraphing the Central Government to Find Ways to Provide Relief as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>The Sichuan Disaster Relief Research Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Nanjing National Government Central Party Department, Military Affairs Committee Central Political Committee, Executive Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Military Affairs, Ministry of Industry, stating: (abbreviated title) Regarding the matter of requesting the abolition of various harsh policies in Sichuan Province, Sichuan is originally an area of wealth, with a year of good harvest sufficient to feed the people for two years. However, after being subjected to the excessive taxation and extortion of the military and political authorities in the province, the people have no savings for even half a year. Taking the land tax alone, the number of pre-collected taxes exceeds even the hundredth year after the Republic of China. The people have long been reduced to skin and bones, and their blood and tears have dried up. Even without natural disasters, this has become a huge calamity. Since last autumn, the entire province has suffered from severe drought. Long-empty granaries and hunger are imminent. The disaster area covers as many as 141 counties, with more than 35 million disaster victims. Grass roots and tree bark have been almost completely dug up. Some compete for white clay to eat, while others cook and eat corpses. Deaths pile up, numbering in the thousands every day. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. However, the authorities in Sichuan, in addition to increasing land taxes and collecting harsh levies, are also forcing the payment of opium taxes on a monthly basis, county by county, and forcibly collecting taxes such as deed verification fees. The opium tax is the most onerous, with each county having to pay a certain number of taels each month, at 2.65 yuan per tael. The repeated demands and joint pursuit lead to taxes that exceed the actual amount by more than double. The most bizarre thing is that even those who do not smoke must pay the tax, and even disaster areas are forced to pay, forcing starving people on the verge of death to complete the horizontal tax that is like drinking poison to quench thirst. How can anyone with a conscience bear to do this? As for the four land tax collections a year, this is a major violation of the central government's laws. All citizens are part of the nation, and Sichuan is not uncivilized. All provinces collect the tax once a year. Why should the people of Sichuan be burdened with four times the tax? At this time of interconnected famine, even reducing or exempting land taxes would be insufficient. Moreover, the imposition of heavy taxes and the imposition of strange policies are exhausting the people of Sichuan. It is earnestly hoped that the central authorities, with their original intention of caring for the people of Sichuan, will resolutely order the Sichuan provincial government to immediately abolish the three major harsh policies of deed verification, opium tax collection, and four land tax collections a year, in order to alleviate the suffering of the people. The Sichuan provincial government may argue that it lacks funds and has no way to advance administrative matters. However, the association believes that abolishing deed verification and stopping opium tax collection, and using only the income from the Sichuan land tax, collected once a year, and other statutory regular contributions, would be sufficient. The regular army in Sichuan is already the best in the country, and according to rumors, there are more than sixty additional regiments. Eighty or ninety percent of the province's annual income is used for military expenses, and only ten or twenty percent is used for education and construction. If troops can be effectively reduced and the huge military expenses used for education and construction, would there not be ample funds? Other measures, such as streamlining redundant agencies, stopping wasteful administrative expenses, and striving for savings, should not be difficult to offset the costs. The members of the association are all from Sichuan and are concerned about the safety and security of their hometown, which is of great importance to the overall situation of the country. At this time of severe disaster, if ways are not found to provide relief as soon as possible, so that the more than 30 million disaster victims can have a way to recover, the disasters of the late Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty will revive in Sichuan. What is felt to be dangerous must be spoken. We appeal and submit this matter, hoping that it will be adopted.</p>

<h3>Dr. Wu Lien-teh Sails Abroad This Morning on a Mission</h3>
<p>To Attend the International Rural Health Conference and Then to the First International Cremation Conference</p>
<p>The International Rural Health Conference convened by the League of Nations will be held in Bandung, Java, on August 2 of this year. This is the first time that the annual meeting will be held in the Far East. China has appointed eight representatives, including Wu Lien-teh and Yen Yangchu, who will travel south in batches. Dr. Wu Lien-teh boarded the German postal ship Scharnhorst at 9:00 PM last night and left Shanghai this morning. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency visited Dr. Wu yesterday afternoon and learned the details, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending the Rural Health Conference</p>
<p>According to Dr. Wu, this rural health conference is the first to be held in the Far East. The participating countries include China, the Netherlands, Japan, the Central Government, France, Australia, India, and South Africa, among other thirteen units. The Chinese delegation consists of eight people. In addition to Dr. Wu leaving tomorrow morning, the other representatives, including Liu Ruiheng, Jin Baozhen, Yen Yangchu, Xu Shilian, Lin Kesheng, Wu Xian, and Zhu Zhanggeng, will also leave the country in the coming days. The conference will focus on discussing rural health, tropical diseases, fever, leprosy, veterinary medicine, hookworm, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and how to prevent them. The conference will last for seven days and close on the tenth.</p>
<p>Participating in the International Cremation Conference</p>
<p>After completing his duties in Java, Dr. Wu will go to London to attend the first meeting of the International Cremation Conference, which will be held from September 24 to 28. The meeting will discuss new methods of cremation and economic and health issues. Dr. Wu is a member of the Shanghai Crematorium Preparatory Committee and is also a member of the conference, so he is very enthusiastic about promoting cremation. After the meeting, he will go to the United States to attend the All-American Health Conference in New York from October 6 to 10. The conference is held annually. This year, the US Health Department has spent billions of dollars paying attention to the elimination and prevention of venereal diseases, and the results will be many. Dr. Wu is going to investigate these facilities. He will be out of the country for six months before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Operators of the Three Shipping Companies Request Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>Six Requests Submitted to the General Association for Negotiation</p>
<p>The telegraph operators of the Sanbei Hongan, Ningxing, and Three-Wheeled Shipping Companies are aware that the company has successively improved the treatment of sailors, machinists, and navigators, but the telegraph operators are still hoping for more. Therefore, they have petitioned the General Association of Ship Radio Operators, requesting that it negotiate with the three companies. After learning about the situation, the association sent letters to the three shipping companies, asking them to investigate. The original letter is as follows: Respected Sirs, We have learned that the entire body of telegraph operators of your company has stated (abbreviated) that they are making six requests: ⑴ Improve treatment and increase the monthly salary of all telegraph operators by 50 yuan to reflect the state's emphasis on maritime technicians; ⑵ Only one telegraph operator is employed on each ship, which does not seem to comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Communications and Electrical Affairs. Given the current situation, where telegraph operators have no possibility of promotion, their salaries should be increased annually. Therefore, it is proposed to request an annual increase of 15 yuan in monthly salary; ⑶ Full salary should be paid during the repair period; ⑷ Paid leave should be granted in accordance with maritime law; ⑸ The company's food arrangements for sailors are unfair and should be improved to ensure equality with the captain; ⑹ Telegraph operators should not be dismissed without cause. After investigation, the requests seem reasonable. We are sending this letter in the hope that you will investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Citywide Boy Scout Mobilization to Collect Disaster Relief Donations for Two Days</h3>
<p>Starting from 8:00 AM Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Disaster Relief Association, in view of the extraordinary severity of the drought in the provinces of Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi this year, where disaster victims are on the verge of death, and although the central government has issued relief funds and people from all walks of life are enthusiastically contributing, the disaster area is too wide to provide effective relief. Therefore, it has requested the Shanghai Boy Scout Council to order Boy Scouts throughout the city to collect disaster relief donations along the roads in the Shanghai International Settlement for the next two days to provide relief. The association, considering the importance of the righteous act, immediately approved the request, ordering each group to send Boy Scouts to report to the relief association at Renji Hall on Yunnan Road before 8:00 AM this morning to receive donation books and set off for fundraising. The Shanghai Boy Scout Council has also set up a temporary office in the party headquarters to facilitate command.</p>

<h3>Approved: Europe-America Air, Eurasia Beiping-Hong Kong Line to Open on the 29th, Timetable and Fares Set</h3>
<p>One-way Ticket from Beiping to Hong Kong is 280 Yuan. Newly Appointed Directors of Three Stations Have Arrived. Connectivity to Penang, India, Europe, and America</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has ordered Eurasia Aviation to resume the Beiping-Guangdong air route and extend it to Hong Kong to facilitate joint operations with air routes in Europe and America. The company has completed preparations, and all flight times and fares were finalized yesterday. New directors have been appointed for the Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Changsha stations, and the inaugural flight is approved for the 29th of this month. Details are reported by a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>The company's Beiping-Guangdong line was suspended in 1932 due to flooding in Hankou, which inundated the airport, coupled with low passenger and freight traffic. The route was shortened to operate only between Beiping and Zhengzhou, running once a week in both directions. Subsequently, after a year, the Ministry of Communications, recognizing the line's importance, ordered its resumption. The company first extended it to Hankou. Recently, the Ministry stipulated the full restoration of the line and, to promote the development of international air transport, specifically extended the route to Hong Kong. General Manager Li Jingcong, after receiving the order, actively prepared, negotiating with the British government to establish a station in Hong Kong. Permission was granted, a license was issued, and an airport was borrowed. Personnel were dispatched to make arrangements, and preparations have recently been completed.</p>
<p>Appointment of Directors</p>
<p>The line is 2,330 kilometers long and has seven stations: Beiping, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Hankou, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. In addition to the original personnel in charge of the four stations of Beiping, Jin, Zheng, and Han, General Manager Li appointed Hu Weijin as the director of the Changsha station, Deng Gaozhang as the director of the Guangzhou station, and Guan Rong as the director of the Hong Kong station. All three have now arrived at their respective posts and assumed their duties.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Brewery Labor Strike Becomes Increasingly Complex</h3>
<p>Old Workers Petitioned Various Agencies Yesterday. New Workers Refused to Work Due to Harsh Treatment</p>
<p>All 175 workers at the Shanghai Brewery went on strike because the factory refused to reinstate three dismissed workers and increase wages. This strike has been ongoing for three days without a satisfactory resolution. The following is a report of yesterday's news:</p>
<p>New Workers Strike Again</p>
<p>After the workers went on strike, the factory recruited 30 new workers, who began working in the factory the day before yesterday in order to salvage some of the losses. At 7:30 AM yesterday, the new workers, under tight protection, still entered the factory as usual to work. At 8:30 AM, the factory manager, Ericson, came out to address all the new workers. He first reported the situation after the old workers went on strike, and then announced the salaries of the new workers, saying that before the old workers return to work, each new worker would be paid 60 cents in national currency, and they would work as usual on Sundays, with wages increased by 20%. Upon hearing this, the new workers, considering the original wage of the old workers, calculated that they could earn 66 cents a day, and they would be paid double wages on Sundays. Now, not only would they not receive an increase, but their wages would be reduced. Therefore, they also refused to work. At a signal, all 20 new workers left the factory, and the factory was shut down again. Apart from a few staff members, the iron gates were tightly closed.</p>
<p>Old Workers Petition</p>
<p>As for the old workers, after petitioning the manager the day before yesterday without success, they sent three representatives, Xu Xueqing, Zhao Jinyuan, and Sha Jinyu, at 8:00 AM yesterday, first to the Maple Bridge Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. They were received by Fan Guoren of the department. The three representatives reported the entire process of the strike in detail and requested the party headquarters to negotiate with the factory based on the eight conditions obtained by the workers (see yesterday's newspaper). Mr. Fan immediately accepted all of them and agreed to mediate. The representatives were satisfied and then went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in the city center to make the same request for assistance. They were received by Zhang Chuqiang of the bureau. Mr. Zhang, in addition to instructing the workers to strictly maintain order, also agreed to provide assistance. The three representatives then left, waiting for the disposition of the party and government agencies after reporting the petition process to all the workers.</p>
<p>Recruiting Female Workers Again</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the new workers refused to work, the factory immediately posted a notice in front of the factory gate to recruit female workers. When the workers caught sight of it, they immediately sent representatives to wait in front of the factory gate, intending to prevent it. The factory then reported to the police station by telephone, and the police dispatched detectives. The detectives, fearing an incident, dispersed the workers. Fortunately, no conflict occurred. By 5:00 PM, a total of 39 female workers had registered and were scheduled to enter the factory this morning to apply for work.</p>

<h3>Local Transportation Industry Opposes Small Automobiles</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Meeting of Relevant Organizations Was Convened. Greatest Impact on the Livelihoods of Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>Since the French Concession allowed the operation of small automobiles, various sectors of the local transportation industry have risen up in opposition. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Xiang Sheng Automobile Company initiated a meeting to discuss methods of opposition, attended by Chen Gengcai and Guo Shiliang, representatives of the Automobile Industry Association; Qin Yizhou and Yu Dajin, representatives of the Rickshaw Pullers Association; Zhu Fengxiang and Zhang Jiande, representatives of rickshaw pullers; and Zhou Xiangsheng, representative of Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, totaling seven people. Zhou Xiangsheng first reported on the contact between the manager of the small automobiles and Mr. Zhou, saying, "Previously, Mr. Li Qi, the owner of the Liwei Clock Shop, contacted me, intending to cooperate with me in running this business. I refused because I believed that the implementation of these vehicles would have a huge impact on the local transportation industry. I also heard that these small automobiles were manufactured in the United States and numbered in the thousands. They were originally intended to operate in the United Kingdom, but the British government did not approve them, and they were rejected. Now they are trying to find markets around the world. Therefore, if they are allowed to operate in this city, all aspects will be affected. Recently, the Automobile Industry Association sent a letter to the British Works Bureau to inquire about the bureau's attitude towards small automobiles and requested that no operating licenses be issued. The Works Bureau has replied, agreeing to follow the association's opinion and will not issue licenses. The association also sent a letter to the Municipal Council, questioning the reasons for allowing the operation of small automobiles and presenting five disadvantages of operating small automobiles, namely: ㊀ If small automobiles operate, all sectors of the transportation industry will suffer losses; ㊁ Road traffic is already extremely complex. If these huge types of automobiles are added, traffic will become even more congested; ㊂ The annual license fee for rental automobiles is 130,000. If these automobiles operate, the number of rental automobiles will definitely decrease sharply, which may affect tax revenue; ㊃ Small automobiles can pick up passengers anywhere and can enter any secluded and narrow alley. Bandits will inevitably use them as tools for crime, which is not the case with large automobiles, which have a traceable basis and cannot enter narrow alleys; ㊄ If large automobiles are forced to stop operating, the unemployment of rickshaw pullers will increase, which will affect public security. The French authorities have replied strongly to the above points, stating that this is the bureau's sovereign right and that it has the right to allow anyone to operate this business, and interference is not allowed." After Mr. Zhou's report, the representatives stood up and spoke in succession, generally saying that the British Works Bureau and the French Municipal Council had previously used the excuse of too many vehicles to reduce the number of rickshaws by 500, and now there are only 9,500. Now, on the contrary, they are adding these vehicles, which not only cuts off the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers but also violates the previous purpose of reducing vehicles. Therefore, they resolutely oppose the operation of these vehicles. It was unanimously agreed to cooperate and share the work, with each industry association separately requesting the Chinese Ratepayers Association to negotiate with the Works Bureau to not issue licenses for these vehicles in order to fulfill the promise, requesting the Municipal Public Works Bureau to not issue licenses, and requesting the French Municipal Council to limit the issuance of licenses to the current four vehicles and not to issue any more in the future. The original text of the rickshaw pullers' presentation to the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the French Municipal Council, strongly opposing the operation of small automobiles, is extracted as follows: "In the past, our income from pulling rickshaws was still enough to maintain our livelihoods. In recent years, many routes have been laid with tracks and electric trams have become accessible. At the same time, public buses have been added without end, so that the daily income from pulling rickshaws has been sharply reduced, and even after paying the rickshaw rent, a hard day's work is not enough to feed our families. Recently, we read in the newspapers about the appearance of small automobiles and heard that an application has been submitted to your bureau for approval. The rickshaw pullers were shocked. There are still 9,500 rickshaws in the special area of this port, excluding the 500 that were reduced, and there are also a number of rental automobiles, which are sufficient for the convenience of the public. The more than 9,000 rickshaws support more than 100,000 people, including the families of our 40,000 rickshaw pullers. If these small automobiles are allowed to operate, not only will the livelihoods of our tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers and more than 100,000 people be in a desperate situation, but it will also affect social stability, which is not a trivial matter. For the sake of social stability and the future livelihoods of our more than 100,000 poor rickshaw pullers, we are forced to submit this document to your association for review. Regarding small automobiles, in any case, please do not approve them."</p>
<h3>French Police Cross Border to Pursue Person</h3>
<p>Due to Seeing a Milk Delivery Man with a Panicked Expression. Taken to the Police Station and Notified to be Claimed by the Police</p>
<p>At around 5:00 AM yesterday, Chinese policeman No. 704 of the French police, together with a Western policeman, were on duty on Haig Road when they suddenly caught sight of a young man in his twenties riding a bicycle with many milk bottles on it. When the young man saw the two policemen, his expression suddenly became panicked. The two policemen, suspecting that the milk had not been approved by the health department and was privately produced, intended to go forward to inspect it. Unexpectedly, the young man accelerated and fled into the Houjiazhai area of the nearby Chinese district. At that time, Chinese policeman No. 704 also followed and intercepted the young man. There were many onlookers. When the police officer on duty at the Da Xi Road police station caught sight of it, he immediately went forward to ask about the situation and brought the Chinese policeman and the young man to the police station together, transferring them to the Xujiahui police station. After the station chief explained the situation, he immediately notified the Petain Road police station. The police station specially sent a Western detective to the station to bring the two men back. The young man's name was Shen Maonü, a local, 24 years old, and he made a living delivering milk. The police chief considered the case to be minor and immediately released Shen.</p>
<h3>More Than 6,000 Artifacts in the Shanghai Museum's Special Exhibition of Literature</h3>
<p>Yao Zirang's Relics and Rare Books Are Quite Valuable. The Museum Has Been Closed Since the Day Before Yesterday to Arrange the Exhibits</p>
<p>The Shanghai Museum's sixth special exhibition, the Shanghai Literature Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Museum, has been actively prepared, and the results of soliciting artifacts by Ye Gongchuo's travels have been extremely satisfactory. According to Hu Yechun, the director of the museum, the museum has been temporarily closed since yesterday to arrange the literature exhibition. It is said that many literature exhibits have been received this time, and the arrangement is particularly time-consuming. By "yesterday," more than 6,000 pieces had been received, and more are still being sent. It has now been decided to use the second to fourth floors upstairs entirely for the literature exhibition. Because the items on the ground floor are also to be displayed, arrangements will also be made. After several days of registration and cataloging, there is already a clue. This special exhibition, with the assistance of the heads of various counties and cities, has not only received many and exquisite exhibits, but also many rare and valuable items. On the 21st and 22nd, as many as 2,000 pieces were received each day. Among the exhibits this time, there are Yao Zirang's relics, exhibits from the Xujiahui Observatory, fine products from various counties, historical materials from the Municipal Gazetteer Museum, etc. As for the exhibits from various counties, most of them are rare books and calligraphy, paintings, and clothing of celebrities.</p>
<h3>Monk and Widow Cohabitate for a Decade, Recently Involved in a Lawsuit Over Savings</h3>
<p>Whose are the 70,000 Yuan in Savings? Buddhist Disciple Unable to Resolve Worldly Ties</p>
<p>A Fujian woman, Huang Jinxi, is now 47 years old. She was previously married to a Mr. Lin, a tycoon in the Taiwan sugar industry. Her husband died 20 years ago. Ten years ago, Huang went to Putuo Mountain Wenchang Pavilion in the South China Sea to burn incense and met the abbot of the temple, Monk Hua Xiang (secular name Huang Fusheng), a native of Wenzhou (48 years old), and a relationship developed. In 1929, they began living together at No. 42, Ping'an Lane, No. 239, Avenge Road, Shanghai, and have been living together for many years. But recently, they suddenly fell out. Huang took advantage of Hua Xiang's trip to Putuo to move to No. 10, Garden Lane, Luban Road in the French Concession. Hua Xiang had no idea where she now lived. On the 9th of this month, Hua Xiang hired lawyer Ling Qihong to publish an advertisement in the newspaper, saying that seven ledgers of 70,000 yuan in foreign currency, which he had deposited with Huang at the Four Banks Savings Society, had been taken by her. In addition to publishing the statement in the newspaper, he also reported the loss to the bank, etc. After reading the newspaper, Huang hired a Japanese lawyer to report to the General Police Station, saying that a certain Huang Fu deposited 70,000 yuan in the Four Banks Savings Society on March 15, 1934, in the name of Huang Fuji, for a fixed term of two years, divided into seven ledgers. The ledgers, along with the round seal, were placed in a safe deposit box (account name Huang Fushan) opened by the person at the China First Trust Company. When it expired on March 17, 1936, they went to China First together with Hua Xiang and took out the ledgers and the seal, instructing Hua Xiang to go and withdraw the interest of more than 8,000 yuan and transfer it for another two years. At that time, after the formalities were completed, the ledgers were still placed in the safe deposit box. But not long after, when taking out other items from the safe deposit box, she suddenly discovered that in two of the seven ledgers, only the ledger shells remained, and the ledger cores had disappeared. Because no one else had handled the ledgers, she questioned Hua Xiang. The monk admitted that he had taken 20,000 yuan from them. At that time, she was afraid of losing face after publicizing it, so she also put it aside. But recently, she inquired at the Four Banks and learned that the monk had replaced the seal with another one when transferring the period. Although it was still Huang Fuji, the style was completely different. Therefore, she could not withdraw the money at all. Just as she was about to negotiate, Hua Xiang suddenly published an advertisement, saying that the ledgers had been taken by her. She then came forward to report to the police station. Based on her report, detective Zhang Mingde, detective Tang Zengxiang, and detective Mao Yunlong went to Jixiang Temple, No. 204, Qipu Road, at 2:00 AM the day before yesterday and arrested Hua Xiang. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the above facts and filed a lawsuit according to Article 336 of the Criminal Law for embezzlement, and asked for a postponement for investigation. When questioned, Hua Xiang claimed that the money belonged to him and that he had only deposited the ledgers in her safe deposit box. His lawyer, Ling Qihong, pointed out that Huang was actually a Lin, 57 years old, and a native of Fujian. Now she claims to be Japanese in order to seek the protection of consular jurisdiction and avoid false accusations. Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and ordered a postponement for another week for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Woman Has Affair, Gets Pregnant, Secretly Aborts</h3>
<p>Midwife Flees, Introducer Detained for Investigation</p>
<p>A woman named Dong Guizhen, last year had an affair with a man named Wu Bingrong and lived with him at No. 8, Xie Xing Lane, Alabaster Road. Recently, Guizhen, realizing she was one month pregnant, wanted to find a way to abort the fetus for the sake of her reputation, but did not discuss it with her lover, Wu Bingrong. She proceeded secretly, falsely telling Wu that she wanted to return to her hometown for a few days to visit her family. Wu did not suspect anything. Dong Guizhen then set off for her hometown on the 22nd of this month. Unexpectedly, Dong returned home that day, saying that the ship had already left and she would have to depart the next day. By the day before yesterday, Dong still had not left, and it was discovered that her condition was abnormal, as if she were seriously ill. When questioned, Dong revealed the details of the abortion, saying that the day she claimed to have returned home, she had in fact gone out with her friends Mao Jinlin and Ni Guizhen, and through the introduction of a local woman named Li Yu, residing at No. 7, Lane 28, Yunnan Road, sought the services of midwife Wang Zhang, residing at No. 169, Parker Road, to perform the operation and induce an abortion with herbal medicine. The agreed fee was 25 yuan, with 10 yuan paid in advance and the remaining amount to be paid after the abortion. She had originally planned to stay at Wang Zhang's house for a few days, but because she felt unwell, she returned home, and so on. Wu Bingrong, having learned the truth, went to Parker Road and found the midwife Wang Zhang, and they returned home together. Seeing Dong Guizhen's condition worsening, Wu and Wang sent the woman to Guangren Hospital. After examination, the doctor determined that she had undergone an abortion, which constituted a criminal offense. They immediately reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which forwarded the case to the Huishi Police Station, ordering Chinese and Western detectives to go to investigate. Unexpectedly, Wang Zhang had already taken the opportunity to flee. Only the introducer Li Yu was apprehended on Yunnan Road and taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang charged the defendant Li Yu with the intent to profit by accepting the request of a pregnant woman to induce an abortion, according to Article 290 of the Criminal Law. Since Wang Zhang was on the run and Dong Guizhen's fetus had already been aborted, she was still in the hospital and could not appear in court today, he requested a postponement. When questioned, Li Yu confessed, "I have known Mao Jinlin for a long time. That day, Mao and Dong came, saying that Dong had a husband in her hometown, but was now pregnant in Shanghai and could not return home. They asked me to find a way to help, so I introduced Wang Zhang to perform the abortion for a fee of 25 yuan, with 10 yuan paid in advance," and so on. Judge Huang then briefly questioned the witness Mao Jinlin and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, with a retrial scheduled in seven days.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate's Search for Escaped Japanese Thief Yields Hilarious Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Extensive Search Alarms Monks; Detective Dreams of Strangling Child</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, although the Consulate General's police have made every effort to search for escaped Japanese thief Masao Horita, 45 days have passed and his whereabouts remain unknown. Recently, a series of hilarious anecdotes have emerged. (1) A few days ago, a Russian policeman from the Public Works Department suddenly reported to the Consulate General that he had seen Horita on a tram going towards Yangshupu. Based on the report, the department immediately assembled the police, all armed with pistols, and ordered all trams traveling from the French Concession to Yangshupu to stop for inspection. However, it was all in vain, and the police returned dejectedly. (2) One day, the Consulate General's police department received another phone call stating that Horita had escaped on a boat along the Huangpu River. The department immediately dispatched a large number of armed police officers on the Asahi steamboat to search. Suddenly, they saw a steamboat ahead, mistakenly believing it to be the one carrying Horita. They urgently pursued it, but after catching up, it vanished without a trace. All officers returned to the station dispirited. (3) The Consulate General recently received a report stating that Horita had become a monk at Longhua Temple, living by chanting sutras. The department urgently dispatched officers, together with Mr. Pan from the Beizhan Police Station, to Longhua Temple. Upon arriving at the temple, they identified each monk one by one, but Horita was not among them, causing all the monks to be greatly alarmed. Later, they heard that he was west of Longhua, but the area west of Longhua was vast, and the search lasted for two days and two nights. The feet of the police officers were swollen and sore, and they returned home depressed. (4) One night, Kurosawa, a detective from the Consulate, dreamed that he was investigating in the French Concession and saw Horita in front of him. He immediately loaded his gun and fired, forcefully grabbing the thief's head with both hands. Unexpectedly, in his dream, he strangled the neck of his young child sleeping next to him. The child woke up crying, and he realized that he had strangled his own child.</p>
<h3>Brawl Over Six Yuan Debt</h3>
<p>Li Guangyu's Side Loses; Two Injured</p>
<p>At 5:50 PM on the 13th of this month, a man named Li Guangyu demanded payment of six yuan in debt from a Wu surnamed partner at the Hudong No. 1 Theater at No. 934 Qiwupu Road. Failing to do so, a brawl broke out. Both sides gathered dozens of people, using axes, iron bars, and nine-section iron whips to beat each other violently. As a result, Qian Zhengdong from Beijing, on Li Guangyu's side, was injured in the head by an axe, and Zhou Jun from Anhui suffered minor injuries. The Hudong No. 1 Theater side was victorious. Police officers Jin Guanya and Zhao Baosheng from the Yulin Road Police Station, along with Western detectives, were dispatched to arrest the perpetrators. The group scattered like birds and beasts. Qian and Zhou were taken to the police station. Qian was sent to the police hospital for treatment, and Zhou Jun was sent to the First Special District Court the next morning for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Dai Rongduo continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu charged them with disrupting public order under Article 150 of the Criminal Law, stating that the two main culprits were at large and could not be apprehended. Qian Zhengdong's injuries had slightly improved, and he was brought to court for questioning. Both defendants refused to confess the truth about the assault, asking for leniency. Judge Dai ordered them to remain in custody for further investigation.</p>

On the 3rd of this month, Jiang purchased 22 bales of cotton yarn from the company on behalf of Xizengxiang Cotton Yarn Shop, valued at 9,354 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen. However, after receiving the payment, he embezzled the funds and did not deliver them to the company. The company reported this to the General Police Station, which ordered detective Geng Debiao to arrest Jiang at Room 69 of the Yipinxian Hotel. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi charged Jiang with embezzlement in the First Special Court. The trial has concluded, and yesterday, Judge Feng Shide announced the verdict in the First Criminal Court, sentencing Jiang Bingsheng to one year of imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of property held in trust in the course of business.</p>
<h3>Daughter-in-Law Raped by Neighbor, Reported by Mother-in-Law</h3>
<p>Gen Di Confesses to Having Illegitimate Child; Original Judgment Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>Qu Binggen, a 27-year-old local resident of No. 1, Beichuan Bay, Yin Xing Town, Jiangwan, is a pervert. On September 16th of last year, while on the embankment behind the Mao family's residence, he saw Luo Gongs' 20-year-old adopted daughter-in-law, Luo Gendi, aka Luo Zhaodi, walking alone. Qu forcibly raped her in broad daylight in the farmland. The next day, he threatened her with a knife and continued to rape her twice. Unexpectedly, the seed of sin was planted, and she was due to give birth in April of this year. Luo Gongs discovered this, and Gendi, feeling ashamed, almost committed suicide, but was rescued and temporarily stayed with relatives to avoid further incidents. Luo Gongs reported this to the District Court. Prosecutor He Jingcen investigated, but because the statute of limitations of six months had passed, he did not prosecute. The plaintiff requested a reconsideration, and Prosecutor Huang Meiqing investigated, charging Qu Binggen with Article 221, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Now Gendi has given birth to a daughter. Yesterday, Judge Bai Dongling opened the court. Luo Gendi, holding her illegitimate child, appeared in court with her private prosecution lawyer Wang Kanghou, stating that her original name was Zhaodi, 21 years old this year, from Changshu. Last year, around August of the lunar calendar, she was farming at the Xu family's residence. Around 5 or 6 PM, she was returning home when Qu Binggen waited for her on the embankment of the Mao family's residence. When he saw her walking by, he grabbed her, threatened her with a small foreign knife, and dragged her into the cotton field, tearing her waistband and forcibly raping her. She was weak and unable to resist. The next day, she took a different route home, but unexpectedly encountered him again. Afterwards, because she was a child bride, she did not tell her in-laws. Later, as her belly grew larger, she was questioned by her mother-in-law, and she revealed the truth. Now her husband's family does not want her anymore, so she is staying at the home of her fellow villager, Wang Guilin, and so on. The defendant argued that the plaintiff was conspiring, and hired a lawyer to defend him. The original trial has concluded, and sentencing is scheduled.</p>

<h3>Sick and Unable to Afford Care, Child Abandoned on Tram</h3>
<p>Conductor Sends to Police Station; Dies After Ineffective Treatment</p>
<p>Lu Agen, a boy from Nanxiang, ten years old this year, recently suffered from tuberculous caries. Treatment was ineffective, and he was on the verge of death. Unexpectedly, his family, due to being unable to afford the expenses for his medication and food while alive and his coffin and burial after death, came up with an absurd idea. Around 10 PM on the 20th, his family took him on the tram of the French Concession's French-owned Tram Company, traveling between Xujiahui and the 16th Pier. Midway, his family got off the tram and fled, abandoning Agen on the tram. When the tram reached Xujiahui, no one accompanied him off the tram. The conductor of Car No. 419 discovered this, returned with the car to Dazimingzhong, and reported it to the McLaren Police Station. A detective got on the car and carried Agen down to the police station. Searching his person, they found only a piece of cardboard written in pencil, stating the child's name, age, and hometown, but no address. He was then sent to Guangci Hospital, where he died at 7 PM on the 23rd. The police station sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Tang morgue. Yesterday, they reported to the Second Special Court to send someone to verify the body and ordered it to be collected and buried by a charity organization.</p>

<h3>Panchen Lama Has No Objections to Changing Buddha's Birthday</h3>
<p>Qu Wenliu Replies to Losang Jianzan in Detail Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the dispute among monks nationwide over changing Buddha's Birthday, Losang Jianzan, director of the Panchen Lama's Office in Beijing, was quite uneasy after seeing reports that Master Yin Guang opposed the change. He wrote to lay Buddhist Qu Wenliu of the Shanghai Bodhi Society for clarification. Qu has now replied to Director Luo, describing the development of the matter in great detail. Excerpts are recorded below:</p>
<p>Qu Wenliu's Letter</p>
<p>Director Jianzan, I hope you are well. I respectfully acknowledge receipt of your letter. Upon investigation, this matter was initiated by monks in Beiping, and was not a request presented by this society to the Master, nor is it truly the Master's position. At the time, I did not understand the full details of the matter. Later, I learned that the abbot Xianming and Master Fan Cheng of Guangji Temple in Beiping first issued a general letter to unite various parties nationwide, intending to request the government to designate the birthday of Shakyamuni Buddha as a Buddhist memorial day. At the same time, they also invited lay Buddhists Zhu Ziqiao and Feng Yangshan, who were in Beiping at the time, to request the Panchen Buddha to telegraph the National Government to issue a clear decree.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Panchen Lama</p>
<p>The telegram to the Panchen Lama read: "Your Holiness the Panchen Buddha, out of reverence, the Great Sage Shakyamuni Buddha, manifested in this world, bestowing grace upon the desert and benefiting all. Without commemoration, how can reverence be preserved? We believe that the Confucian birthday sacrifice has already been listed in the national statutes. The Buddha's achievements in taming evil spirits are even greater. We respectfully request your Holiness to telegraph the National Government to issue a clear decree designating April 8th of each year as the sacred festival commemorating the birth of the World Honored One, and order all regions to hold lectures and practice together, propagating the supreme teachings so that the sacred deeds of the Tathagata may shine upon the human world, and the light of the Buddhist teachings may widely illuminate all beings. We await your holy reply."</p>
<p>The Panchen Buddha's Telegram</p>
<p>Upon receiving the telegram from Beiping, the Panchen Buddha immediately telegraphed lay Buddhist Zhu Ziqiao of this society, saying: "To lay Buddhist Zhu Ziqiao and other virtuous lay Buddhists of the Shanghai Bodhi Society, I am extremely pleased to receive your telegram. April 15th is the day of the Buddha's enlightenment. Can it be designated as a memorial festival? Please consult with each other and then present a request to the National Government to promote Buddhism."</p>
<p>Consultation Process</p>
<p>This society immediately followed the Buddha's instructions and sent a letter to the Chinese Buddhist Association for consultation. The Buddhist Association replied that this matter was of great importance and sought opinions from all parties before making a final decision. Everyone is truly working to promote Buddhism and has no preconceived notions. I have also explained this to Master Yin Guang in person. This is a special reply, I hope you are aware.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Scout Troop Welcomes Zhang Lie After Hiking Trip</h3>
<p>Zhang Lie, the squadron leader of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Social Boy Scout Troop, traveled from Shanghai to Sichuan last June to investigate scouting in the interior, completing a walking tour of the province. Having endured hardships for over a year and walked more than 10,000 li, he accepted invitations from local scouting communities in Taijiang, Bishan, Jiangbei, and other places to serve as a scout trainer. Now that his journey is complete, he has recently traveled from Yichang to Hankou on foot, and from Hankou he took a boat to Beijing. After arriving in Beijing, he immediately went to the Boy Scout General Association to report. Tomorrow, he will return to Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai early express train to report on his mission. Recognizing Mr. Zhang's feat as remarkable, the troop authorities will have about 100 active and reserve soldiers go to the North Station to welcome him. A tea party will be held in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the morning of the 27th to welcome him. At that time, Mr. Zhang will report on his experiences during the expedition.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing's Birthday Celebration Tomorrow with Public Banquets in the Afternoon and Evening</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the 71st birthday of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent Ningbo businessman in Shanghai. Prominent figures in Shanghai such as Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinrong, and Du Yuesheng originally planned to hold a grand celebration in Mr. Yu's hometown of Longshan. However, Mr. Yu repeatedly declined due to the difficult times, so it was changed to a public banquet at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to offer congratulations. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other groups will present a bronze statue as a memento. It is now known that the public banquet will be held twice, in the afternoon and evening, with famous Shanghai opera performers performing Ping opera day and night to add to the festivities. Friends from all sides are now joining the public contribution. The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association has also begun preparations, but following Mr. Yu's instructions, there will be no auditorium and no gifts will be accepted.</p>

<h3>Villagers in Longhua Petition the Municipal Committee Regarding Land Enclosure</h3>
<p>The Longhua Aviation Port and Eurasia Aviation Company in the southern suburbs previously requisitioned more than 100 mu of farmland in Li Jiazhai, Tang Jiazhai, and Xu Jiazhai to expand the airport, causing panic among the local landowners. They sent representatives to appeal to various agencies, including the Ministry of Interior, to exempt them. Unexpectedly, at 10 AM on the morning before yesterday, Yu Chubai of the Public Works Bureau, Chai Wen'an of the Land Administration Bureau, and others went to the villages to survey and drive stakes. When this was seen by the residents, they gathered to obstruct them and went to the home of the map guarantor Ji Zukang to harass and insult him. Details were briefly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the three villages of Li, Tang, and Xu, which are to be enclosed, are home to more than 100 households, about 1,000 people, who make a living by farming. Once requisitioned, they will inevitably be forced to leave and lose their livelihoods. Therefore, they have risen up in resistance, hoping to be spared. Yesterday morning around 7 AM, more than 100 residents went to the Caojing District Municipal Committee Office to petition. However, since Committee Member Yang was away on business, they did not get what they wanted and dispersed after lingering for a while.</p>
<h3>Factory Leaders Discuss Training Issues</h3>
<p>Factory Representatives Discussed Yesterday</p>
<p>Board members and managers of various large and small factories in this city believe that in the past, civic training has been mostly for ordinary citizens and shop assistants, and business leaders have not participated.

Recently, under the leadership and cooperation of the Civic Training Office, a team affairs committee has been organized, with thirteen committee members elected. Yesterday at 4 PM, they convened a representative meeting of various large and small businesses in a building in the French Concession to discuss how business leaders in this city should receive training, as well as the training guidelines for ordinary citizens. It is heard that a total of more than 150 businesses attended.</p>

<h3>Documents Primarily in Chinese</h3>
<p>— Zhao Menglan</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to various trade associations. In addition to "All documents used in trade with foreign merchants must be affixed with stamps according to regulations, to emphasize legal authority," there was another item: "Delete the commonly used clause in trade, 'In case of doubt, the English text shall prevail,' and change it to 'The Chinese text shall prevail,' to maintain the principle of equality." "Since they reside in the country, they should abide by the country's administrative laws and regulations," so "affixing stamps to emphasize legal authority" is, of course, reasonable. We will not discuss that here. Regarding the change from "English text shall prevail" to "Chinese text shall prevail" on documents, I have some thoughts to share.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's notice clearly states the drawbacks of "English text shall prevail" on documents: "In Sino-foreign contracts (such as the clauses listed in insurance policies), the clauses often contain the words 'In case of doubt, the English text shall prevail.' Our merchants do not notice this and consider it commonplace. Once an incident occurs, they can distort the clauses, win lawsuits by reversing defeats, and the harm suffered is difficult to describe in its entirety..."; From the experience gained from the "victims" whose stories are "difficult to describe in its entirety," we know that the "precedence" issue, which was "considered commonplace," can no longer be "considered commonplace." Although it is somewhat late, it is good to be able to mend the fold after losing the sheep. It is always gratifying to prevent those who have suffered from "suffering" again.</p>
<p>An independent country should primarily use its own national language. That is the general practice. And since foreign merchants' trade documents target Chinese people, they should naturally "regard the Chinese text as the standard." However, in order to exploit our government's lack of extraterritorial rights and other weaknesses, foreign merchants, coupled with the past "lack of awareness among our merchants," have led to "once an incident occurs, they can distort the clauses." This is partly due to "merchant's unawareness," but at least another half is due to others taking advantage of our lack of extraterritorial rights! Therefore, how urgently should we recover consular jurisdiction and other rights!</p>
<p>Now that we have realized that "the harm suffered" from "English text shall prevail" is "difficult to describe in its entirety," then what is the future of "Chinese text shall prevail?" The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's notice says it well: "If our business community can unanimously express that they attach importance to national dignity, they (foreign merchants) should also comply with the psychology of their patrons and think of ways to change. The key to this lies in our hands, depending only on how much effort we put in!"</p>
<p>In addition to requiring foreign merchants to use "Chinese text shall prevail" on documents in the future, it must also be said that our government agencies and other official documents should even more so "regard Chinese text as the standard." If it does not involve foreigners (foreigners who serve in our country's agencies should be required to be proficient in Chinese, we should not accommodate them), then English should be abolished altogether. Because no country uses another country's language to issue orders, inform the people, or have the people submit petitions to the government in another country's language.</p>
<p>However, in our customs, the declaration forms submitted by the people "regard English as the standard." Although this can be attributed to the fact that in the past, the authority of our country's customs was in the hands of foreigners, and there are still many foreigners among the senior officials of the current customs, since the customs is our administrative agency and the Republic of China is an independent country, can we allow this abnormal phenomenon to exist?</p>
<h3>Loneliness</h3>
<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>Your letter said, "You live in such a remote place in your hometown; wouldn't you find it too lonely?" But loneliness should be common to me, and loneliness is not necessarily a bitter taste. Since returning to this place, I have experienced the taste of loneliness more deeply and truly.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the continuous rain prevented me from going to the city. I wanted to read a book, but I didn't have much interest. The only thing I could do was sit quietly without moving. The sky outside the window was very gloomy, the eaves dripped like a curtain, and the rain was sometimes straight and sometimes slanting, but the sound of the wind was drowned out by the rain. The rain fell for three days, and I spent most of my time sitting blankly by the window, not thinking about anything. I just felt a faint taste in the dryness, like sipping a cup of light tea. It felt like it was beyond comfortable and uncomfortable, and the mood was between sadness and joy. At this time, I didn't want to read a book, nor did I want to see anyone. Even ××, whom I think of all day long, I didn't want her to come and disturb my loneliness at this time.</p>
<p>I wanted to describe this kind of lonely taste clearly in a few words, but I couldn't find the right words. I wanted to say it like this: This feeling is neither relaxed nor intoxicated, just like a drop of mint gum dripping into my heart, gradually permeating my whole body, making my whole body feel cool, but not ice-cold. In the quietness, I caught this poetic flavor, and only then could I write such a quiet and beautiful sentence as "The rain beats the pear blossoms, the door is closed deep."</p>
<p>Recently, I often go to Ningyuan, which is full of reeds. In the middle of the sea of reeds, I found a dry and loose path that leads into the depths of the reed catkins. From a distance, when I see the reed catkins, I see a vast expanse of white waves, and the autumn scenery is alluring. But it's not as good as diving deep into the sea of reeds, where I can get the joy of being away from the world. Every time I walk into this path, listening to the rustling sound around me that sounds like wind and rain, I forget where I am.</p>
<p>If I tell you this, you might think I have a penchant for solitude. In fact, loneliness can sometimes be shared with others. One moonless night, × and I came out of a small shop in Yegu Village after drinking two pots of lotus white wine. We sat on a bridge for a long time. At that time, countless stars were reflected in the depths of the water, and there were blurred shadows of trees in the shallows, and there were a few lights from the houses by the water in the distance. We sat for two or three hours, silently. I stared at the windows with lights, imagining the families gathering under each light, and thus I also thought of my home by the rolling river. But I didn't feel homesick because of this. At this time, my heart was shrouded in the loneliness of the starlight and night shadows. As for ×, I believe he felt the same as me. He was definitely not feeling sentimental, because one cannot help but sigh when feeling sentimental, and certainly not happy, because people's mouths do not like to be silent when they are happy. What he was chewing on must be the taste of loneliness between the two.</p>
<p>Although loneliness can sometimes make people irritable, it can also make people feel desolate. If one can experience tranquility and serenity in that sour and bitter taste, then loneliness is also lovely.</p>
