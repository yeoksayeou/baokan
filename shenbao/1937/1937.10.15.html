<h3>敵機投重量炸彈電車被炸燬慘劇</h3>
<p>乘客震出車外死傷廿四人　蘇州河南岸敵亦肆無忌憚</p>
<p>昨日下午二時十五分、敵巨型轟炸機六架、分爲兩隊、飛至閘北上空、在麥根路東站一帶、中央造幣廠以北方面投彈、先在上空盤旋移時、旋卽濫施轟炸、其投下之彈、每次七八枚、同時墮下、故巨聲如雷、隆隆不斷、且均係重量巨彈、爆炸力大、特區内房屋門窗、均格格作響、前後共達三四十枚之多、詎至下午二時四十分許、敵機第三次砲旋投彈時、竟將重量巨彈二枚、擲於滬西麥根路昌平路租界區域内、一在永安紗廠門前、立時爆炸　聲聞遠近、其時適有十六路無軌電車一輛、由北向南駛至該處、立遭殃及第一八五○號司機一名、當卽炸死、車中載有乘客三十餘人、均受震拋出車外、當塲死十人、華捕一名、内有女孩一名、重傷十三人、但均甚危殆、入晚已有十二人斃命、車身全完毀壞、永安紗廠及數百武外之内外紗廠門窗等、亦均受震粉碎、足證該兩彈重量之重及炸力之大、事後卽由工部局方面、𨑙派救護車前往施救、並檢拾彈片、以憑交涉、該處交通、當時約停頓二小時之久、一彈擲於永安紗廠東面鴻章紗廠門首、亦卽爆炸致該廠門牆玻窗、均遭損燬、且有苦力等十餘人受傷、亦經捕房車送醫院救治、查該處係在蘇州河南岸、距日機投彈目的地甚遙、且有河爲隔、雖在極高度下矚、亦極顯明易别、豈敵空軍因短視而未见、抑故意屠殺無辜耶、</p>

<h3>高級司令官談兩週血戰經過</h3>
<p>敵主力摧毀四次總攻失敗　死傷達兩萬已無再犯能力</p>
<p>八一三滬戰爆發後、敵軍傾全國半數以上之陸海空軍兵力、侵我淞滬、三度總攻、俱遭痛擊、創傷極巨、鬥志消沉、敵軍主將松井、乃向國內作第四次之乞援、其增援部隊計陸軍四萬人、騎兵數千人及大量之機械化部隊、於上月二十八日以前、陸續到達、合計在滬兵力、共二十萬人、二十九日起、開始第四次總攻、預定於本月十五日、將我軍擊退至嘉定南翔綫、兩週來三度血戰、砲火之猛烈、為遠東有史以來所未見、敵軍雖盡其精銳、猛犯不休、但我前綫工事、固如金湯、士氣壯勇、氣吞山河、本月十二日、一鼓摧毀其偷渡蕰藻浜南岸之主力、勢如風掃殘葉、十三日更乘勝追擊、殲其餘醜、我堂堂中華健兒、半月間之英勇撻伐、遂使倭寇潰不成軍、第四次總攻之迷夢、不待其限期來臨、卽予粉碎、中央社記者昨日特於大捷之餘、赴軍次訪謁某高級司令官、叩詢兩週來作戰經過、據綜述如次、</p>
<p>敵軍一貫戰略實行</p>
<p>中央突破　　　　綜觀敵軍進犯計劃、始終一貫、採取中央突破戰略、尤用全力攻擊自羅店劉行之我軍左翼陣地、以爲如能突破一點即可長驅直入、威脅我廟行、江灣、閘北、一帶之右翼部隊、不戰自退、不知我軍穏紥穏打、步步爲營、全綫兵力、配備平衡、繼令有一點被襲突破、仍可予以夾擊、至多亦不過爲一村一莊之進退得失、絕對不致牽一髪而動全局、敵軍知已而不知彼、輕學妄進、覆敗自在意中、</p>
<p>猛攻羅店劉行一度經我擊退</p>
<p>敵軍此次總攻、表面上雖爲全綫發動、閘北江灣一帶、亦砲火連天、惟敵軍深知我右翼實力强勁、不可輕犯、故其目的僅在牽制我軍兵力、而其目標則在突破我左翼陣地、至其戰術亦始終不變、先以飛機大砲猛烈轟炸然後再以戰車掩護步兵衝進自上月二十五日展開血戰後、敵軍每日所發大砲、輒以數千計、飛機轟炸、每次亦達數十架、惟我前綫忠勇將士、態度萬分沉着、當敵軍施行轟炸時、按兵不動祇以大砲還擊、一俟擊軍步兵徇進　即躍出迎擊、奮勇肉搏、激戰至本月一日、敵軍向羅店西北之施相公廟·曹王廟·東南之蔡家宅·山塘灣·西面之沈家灣·一帶、及劉行正面、與其東南之顧家宅·東北之周家巷·西王宅·唐家浜·陳巷·北面之太平橋·寶家弄·一帶進犯、各不下七八次、均經我軍奮勇擊退、予以重創、羅店方面敵軍、死傷達三千餘人、劉行方面、死傷千餘人、敵軍聯隊長鈴木八郎等以次軍官、陣亡者甚多、於是激戰遂告一度沉寂、</p>
<p>突破公路西進再被我軍痛擊</p>
<p>至此、敵軍乃移其盤踞於市中心區帶之部隊、前往增厚兵力、自一日起、專以飛機大胞集中轟作、大砲每小時竟達數百發、火力之猛、得未曾有、我軍工事、不無損毀之處、且後援部隊　阻於火力、不能前進、太平橋·竇家弄·一點、被敵突破、我軍於殲敵後、乃於日將自羅店至劉行公路上之部隊、西移一千公尺、軍行神速、敵軍至三日、始敢進至劉行、常晚並以廣福為目標、輕率前進、經我痛擊、浪狽潰退、四日晚再度進犯、並在新木喬、張家宅、等處構築工事、以為根據、至八日我軍反攻、大部予以殲滅、殘餘潰退至公路旁、沿荻經憑河道而守、至此、敵軍乃放棄正面進犯之策略、路向廣福鎮東南之孟家宅·老陸宅·附近窺襲、一路向東北之陳家宅寇擾、數度肉搏、均經擊退、九日敵再犯不逞、雙十節我軍改取攻勢、先驅直入、敵軍仍退至荻涇之東、進犯廣福之企圖、遂被我完全擊碎、至於羅店方面、敵軍向施相公廟一帶進犯者、自一日起至六日止、共達十一次之多、四·五·六·三日間、並曾施用違犯國際公法慘無人道之毒瓦斯致我軍略有死傷、惟我軍抱定與陣地共存亡之决心、始終屹然不動、反之、敵軍犧牲於我彈丸白刃之下者、又達　千餘人、</p>
<p>渡蕰藻浜南犯主力完全殲滅</p>
<p>當敵軍進至郭家宅時、即沿公路南下、企圖偷渡蕰藻浜、三日敵至橋頭堡、被我痛擊不果、洎在公路綫西進受挫後、南渡蕰藻浜之志益切、蓋敵軍企圖越浜、直趨大場、然後分兵進窺眞如·南翔、斷我右翼後路、自四日起、戰事重心遂移至蕰藻浜兩岸、敵軍一面不斷向我大塲陣地轟擊、一面屢謀偷渡、均被我於半渡時擊退、六日拂曉前、敵軍於大雨滂沱黑夜茫茫中達到偷渡目的、其在公路西面之東楊宅及江家宅兩處偷渡者、均僅一二百人、至八日即被我完全消滅、惟在公路東面施用流涙瓦斯　而偷渡至黑大黃宅·楊宅·墻門頭宅、一帶者、則達數千人我軍疾趨堵截血戰三日、敵被消滅大半、約餘千苦守、但後路未斷　得源源增援乓力竟充至一師團之衆、目尚前摧進一公里而達塲石橋宅、十一日拂曉敵軍主力以縱深配備、猛烈向大塲推進、我軍雖苦門不休但犧牲相當壯烈、遂被其前進二公里許至九時　　　　我得精銳部隊增援、忘命反攻同時左右兩翼突出夾擊、將士用命、有進無退、敵軍而受敵突圍逃竄、狼狽不堪、激戰至下午五時、完全被我迫退浜邊、是役血戰之烈、僅歐戰中沙門一役可以比擬、敵軍遺屍遍野、數達三千殘餘潰不成軍我軍乘勝追擊、繼續淸剿、不難殲滅、</p>
<p>閘北屹然未動全綫敵死二萬</p>
<p>至閘北江灣方面、兩週來戰事幾無日停頓　敵軍不斷以飛機大砲轟炸、大有化爲焦土之意、惟我軍工事毫無損毀　陣地不但始終屹然未動、且屢次突擊、頗有進展、連日步兵接觸　敵軍死傷共約二千餘人、又浦東方面我砲兵屢屬施神威、擊其後路、綜計血戰半月、全綫敵軍死傷、約達二萬之衆、如以兩月併計、則在四萬以上、强弩之末、已無再犯之力、雖其第五次增援部隊一師團、已陸續開到、加入戰鬥、但亦無濟於事、預科敵軍如欲再作大規模進犯、必當更謀大量增援云、</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>速建抗戰之工業的基礎</h3>
<p>— 孫懷仁</p>
<p>從來國內許多人對於中國經濟建設的问題，儼然是有了兩種不同的主張，一部分是主張中國“以農文國”的，一部分却是主張“以工立國”的。事實上，一個近代的國家，要完全拋棄了工業而來建設農業，這除了殖民地以外，幾乎是不可能的，同樣，要完全拋棄了農業而專門注重於工業，這對於農業人口占大部分的中國，也不能說是一個很正確的理論。因此，我個人一贯的主張，總以爲中國的經濟建設，旣不需要標榜什麼“以農立國”，也不必竪起什麼“以工立國”的旗幟。中國的需要建立工業基礎，這已是一件無可否認的事，所謂“農業中國，工業日本”的論調，只能說是日本帝國主義者以及歡迎中日經濟提携的人們的迷夢，但是，我們爲要建立我們民族工業的基礎，我們也自然需要改進我們的農業，復興我們的農村購買力，這樣，一方面可以生產我們自已工業所需要的原料，另一方面可以擴大我們工業產品的去路。</p>
<p>這個工業農業的平行建設，我認爲不僅在平時，在目前這個抗戰時期中；尤其是必要，而且這也是一個很好的時機。可是，事實上最近竟還有人在唱抗戰的經濟基礎在農業，而且主張目前旣不必急速建設工業，也不必把沿海的工業移入內地。這些理論的唯一根據，以爲工業建設旣不容易，而中國又是一個農業主要的國家，因此，主張在抗戰期中不必談工業。這些話，表面上好像是很動聽，但實質上是一種不長進的惰性理論。假若我們現在的抗戰，還在千百年前的“靑龍揠月刀時代”，那末，我們也許祇要有充足的農產糧食，就够與敵人持久抵抗了，然而，現在是不同了，一個現代的戰爭，不僅有賴於農業，而且還需要全工業部門的動員。我們這次的全面抗戰，我們並不否認要趕快乘機調整我們的農業，使抗戰時期中的糧食問題，不會遭遇到嚴重的恐慌，但說農業以外就不需要工業建設，那簡直是錯誤。</p>
<p>過去中國的工業，一方面因爲國內政治的不統一，另一方面又因爲帝國主義商品的肆意傾軋，所以產業革命了七十餘年，至今工業還祗有一點極貧弱的基礎，弄得現在抗戰開始以後，深深的嘗到了工業不能自給的苦痛，今後抗戰愈持久一天，這種苦痛自然會愈深感一天的。因此，我們爲要使抗戰得以長期持續，那末，在目前咬緊牙根的建設工業，已絕對不容再有絲毫的疑義。</p>
<p>事實上，在現在來建設工業，不僅是必要，而且可以說是時機。我們呌了二三十年的提倡國貨，試問到如今獲得了一些什麼效果？老實講，中國假若沒有歐戰這個好遭遇，恐怕連現在這一點貧弱的工業基礎都沒有的。換言之，我們要排除工業建設中帝國主義商品傾軋的障碍，决不是一個道德說敎的“提倡國貨”所能奏效，最重要的還是物質的環境。現在抗戰旣已開始，對外貿易行將中絕，尤其是廉價的日本商品，不能再在中國市塲上橫衝直撞了，這一個環境的有助於中國工業建設，實在比唱三十年提倡國貨的力量要大的多。這樣大好的環境假若不利用，那簡直是自暴自棄。又何况目前國內的政治，已出現了空前的大團結，這對於工業的建設，更可以有莫大之助力的。</p>
<p>我們現在建設工業，環境雖然很好，但是困難自然還是有的。這種困難，——生產手段上的，或是技術上的困難，只要我們現在趁早能下决心建設，也未始不能克服的。換一句話說，目前政府是應該立刻嚴密的規定一個工業建設計劃，確定一個抗戰期中最低限度應有的工業種類，然後根據這個規定，趁目前尚未正式宣戰，敵人還不能封鎖各國一切對華和平貿易的時候，迅速盡量的由海外輸入所需要的一切工業生產手段，另一方面，把國內現有之各項所需要的工業生產手段，迅速集中於安全地帶。同時，政府對於工業建設的技術人才，應該有一個緊急的召集，萬一某種技術人才在國內還沒有的話，那也應該立刻設法借用客卿。無論什麼困難，現在總只要我們下决心快幹，一定可以克服的。</p>
<p>關於工業建設投資的問題，我是主張重工業歸國營的，鋼鐵，燃料，機械及金屬工業，都應該由國家投資，其餘各項工業，則不妨由民間投資經營。賢明的民族工業家，我想祇要政府能有一個工業建設的具體計劃拿出來，他們當然不會有利不要圖的，至於國家自身的投資，發內債固然可以，發外債也未始不可，目前祇要弄得到資金，同時在不損害國家主權的範圍內，發債條件苛刻一點，也沒有關係。總之，現在的一切，是都應該以維持抗戰爲第一義；萬一現在的抗戰，到中途因爲物質條件而不能不停止，那我們一切不都是完了嗎？</p>
<h3>美對中日糾紛擬先試行調解</h3>
<p>倘吿失敗再採實際行動　負責方面解釋總統演詞　九國公約會議召集期近</p>

<h3>在轟炸中来去</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>㊅</p>
<p>在夜色蒼茫的園中子，眞如吿訴了我一段故事</p>
<p>“一二八的砲手”——吳履遜，和他的日本夫人離了婚，上華北的前綫去了。</p>
<p>這，我覺得，是很好的一項戲劇材料，我現在略略提供一些素材出來，希望在鬧劇本荒的現劇界能雊有人把它劇化。</p>
<p>吳履遜是日本的土官學校畢業生，廣東人，身體魁梧，年紀只有三十左右。“一二八”時是舊十九路軍的團長，在“一二八”的當晚，他的日本夫人替他生出第一個男孩的時候，他在閘北向日本軍人放出第一發的大砲。</p>
<p>舊十九路軍雲散後、他遊歷過歐洲、在前年，又重蒞日本，我是那時和他相識的，也和他的夫人見過幾次面。他的夫人很愛地，他也很愛他的夫人。不久他們便回廣東去了。</p>
<p>今年我回上海的當時，履遜剛好由廬山下來要回廣州，在上海又曾聚首過一次。那時他吿訴我，說他很關心他的夫人，又說他的夫人要有第三次的生產了。回廣州後曾來一信，報吿着那第三次的生產又是一个男孩。</p>
<p>相別不久，全面抗戰的局面便展開了。沒想出僅僅兩個月的辰光，他竟和他的夫人離了婚，跑上華北的最前綫去。</p>
<p>離婚，據眞如說，是雙方合意的。在他們的離婚的筵席上，眞如曾爲他們作證人。二男一女是由他的夫人帶去了。</p>
<p>履遜夫人在當席説過這樣的話：履遜，你是軍人，處在國難嚴重的時候，正是你應該效命疆塲的時候，請你不要顧慮我。我雖然是生在日本的女子，但日本軍部的侵略獸行，我是澈底反對的，你的兒女我要盡心撫育，要使他們承繼着你的志氣，使他們永遠是中國的兒女。</p>
<p>這，可不是一塲悲壯劇嗎？</p>
<p>履遜是儘可以留在廣州盡着他的職守的，然而他却上了華北的最前綫，這心情是值得我們酌取的。</p>
<p>在夜色蒼茫的園子中聲到眞如吿訴我　感覺着興奮，但一面也感覺着會心的微笑………</p>
<p>——中國有這樣的軍火，中國是絶對不會亡的！</p>

<h3>英武官遭掃射事岡本飾詞巧辯</h3>
<p>諉稱空中不易辨認誤會開槍　一司機前駕英大使遭難車者</p>
<p>申時社云、英國航空上尉馬瑞、日前由京來滬、石中突遭日本飛機襲擊此案發生後英國僑民極度憤慨、日駐滬總領事岡本、曾於昨日午後赴英領事署、向英駐滬總領事費利浦表示慰問、並飾詞巧辯、謂因飛機在空中不易辨別、致誤會開槍、希圖推卸責任、至馬瑞上尉雖未受傷、但飽受虛驚、據英領事鮑脫、昨晨語申時社記者、馬瑞上尉何日返京現未定、恐將在滬稍作休養、並據記者探悉、駕駛馬瑞來滬之汽車、有二華人駕駛、其中一人、當前次英大使許閣森來滬途中遭難時、彼亦適為駕駛人、此次竟又遭逢此刦、可謂巧合之至、但亦可見日方不顧公理、有意轟炸第三國人士矣、</p>
<p>故意射擊之一鐵證</p>
<p>大陸報云、日飛機以機關槍射擊英大使署之汽車情形、昨巳由英當局公布、惟有一事、未經述及、而由大陸報查明使人甚覺奇異者、當日一行共汽車三輛、最先二輛、由俄人斐汀賀夫駕駛、因斐氏曾駕車往來京滬出數次、熟悉公路情形故也、據斐氏語大陸報訪員、渠所行路程、全照豫先照會日當局者、絕未差訛、斐氏之車、乃美通汽車公司所有、漆成灰色、並無特別標識、該車居餘一車前約半哩許、首見日機突下、作施擊狀斐氏即停車、急與同車數人躍入道旁溝中以避之、溝水深幾及頸乃日機未向開機關槍射擊、而竟向後一車車頂漆有英國國徽者開槍、致車上彈孔纍纍、此車一漆深栗色、遠觀之、如黑色、車頂之旗、必能在高度淸楚瞭見、馬瑞大尉所乘之車殿後車身之色、比較爲黑、乃日機何以獨注意此一車、若謂未見第一車　則何以出事後十分鐘、上海蘇俄總領事署由滬派出之汽車往拖沙賀夫在距松約五哩處拋錨之車署亦爲所見、而以機關槍擊之乎、此誠令人不解也、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>對於天空威脅應有的認識</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>外報上早就說過。敵人的野蠻和殘忍。是比“莽原”種族還不如的。在我國境內。現在除了西部幾省以外。可還有一塊和平的樂土。能够避免敵機的威脅的麼。</p>
<p>當然。敵機慘無人道的到處轟炸。是只能增長我們的敵愾心。不會在戰爭上發生决定的效力的。可是我各地同胞在這種威脅之下。郤也不可不有幾種正確的認識。</p>
<p>第一。我們須知。現代任何國家的空軍都還不能絕對地控制天空。而空軍的任務只在攻擊敵軍及防衛軍事區域與主要都市。敵人現在不顧正義人道。侵入我國不設防的和平區域。肆意轟炸。這種可恥的行逕只是沒落的徵兆。</p>
<p>第二。空軍在現代軍備上還只處於輔助的地位。因為空軍不能久留天空。佔領土地。（蘇聯的空軍是例外）而空戰的意義也只限於互相消耗。就這點意義來說我空軍所表現的成績已經很出色了。</p>
<p>第三。在當前的立體戰爭中間。我全國地域簡直可以說沒有前方和後方的分別。各地民衆應該隨時以合作的精神。盡力於防空設備。遇到敵機來襲。尤須力持鎭靜。以維地方秩序。</p>
<p>這幾點認識是戰時各地同胞必須具備的心理條件。</p>

<p>十月十三日</p>
<p>昨天蕰藻浜南岸　整日的血戰眞是出乎松井意料之外的、非但無損於我們的“抵抗力、反倒擊　破了敵人自己的“攻擊力”經過了昨天的敵我主力之一戰、敵人已經失去攻擊的能力、今天伏居壕中整未敢出擊、我們呢、今天又乘勝向前山江家宅渡河的敵人進擊、奪獲了輕機關槍步槍、及其他的戰利品不少、</p>
<p>敵人在陸地上旣受到了重大的打擊、今天便出動大批的飛機到處轟炸、沉重的爆炸聲、淸脆的機槍聲、間着宏大的高射砲聲、整天簡直沒有片刻的寗靜、這在敵人大約也算是報復吧、然而在我們呢、除了田野間多添幾個避彈洞之外、却什麼也沒有損害、</p>
<p>戰利品源源地從各綫送來、今天又看到、本敵人下級軍官的日記、在這裏面、記着動員的程序和出發前的準備、十分詳細、而敵人對於我們空軍的恐懼、也在種種行動上顯示了出來、現在开把這戰死的敵人的日記節譯在下面、原文是十分簡潔和美麗、這在我却無法保存了、</p>

<h3>閘北我軍大勝後今晨奏凱後回原陣地</h3>
<p>試探敵軍實力完成牽制目的　蕰藻浜南岸我軍反攻有進展　敵企圖由新陸宅偷渡已失敗</p>
<p>我軍昨日全綫反攻、閘北方面、我軍分由東寶興路·虬江路·廣東街·中州路·八字橋·等處、猛撲敵陣、以坦克車及其他機械化部隊爲前導、先以猛烈砲火轟擊、敵出不意、倉皇應戰、我忠勇將士衝鋒陷陣、當者披靡　殺敵如麻、激戰二小時、敵遺屍潰退、我軍直搗北四川路老靶子路以北、横浜路以南、長春路以西、均在我軍控制下、是役、敵傷亡損害極重、防禦工事更摧燬無餘、我軍目的原在試探敵軍實力、消耗其彈藥物質、並予以相當威脅、昨晚完成使命後、卽於今晨奏凱退回原防綫、敵經此挫敗、已士無門志、今晨閘北江灣比較沉寂、蘊藻浜南岸、敵屢圖蠢動、均被我軍擊退、我三面進逼、殘敵退集浜邊、匿壕不出、狠狽萬分、日內卽可全部肅淸、敵發言人屢作狂言、但近日對軍事進展無隻字宣傳、僅謂一切準備就緒、待機總攻、足證我軍連日大勝、均係鐵一般的事實也、</p>
<p>中央社云、本社閘北隨軍記者十五日午十二時報告、我軍昨晚向北四川路方面反攻、頗爲得手、達到預定目的後、卽收兵、去、惟該路之中段、則全在我軍控制之下、惟敵以被我突破陣地、心殊不甘、故調援補充後、於晨四時半、由該路東段各街口、向我反攻、雙方巷戰三小時、敵無寸進、我軍仍控制新陣地、又據軍息、昨晚六時後、我軍在閘北、寶山路·天通庵·八字橋一帶、分路進攻、其目的在試探敵軍實力、經我軍將敵前哨迫退、進出敵第一道防綫敵軍倉皇應戰、狼狽不堪、移時我以目的已達、卽相率撤至原陣綫此役斬獲敵軍甚衆、</p>
<h3>閘北我進攻告捷</h3>
<p>我各地砲隊全綫猛烈進攻　敵倉皇棄械潰退遺屍滿地</p>
<p>我軍右翼閘北一綫、鑒於敵軍連日傾其全力向薀藻浜南渡猛犯、以圖遂其中路突破之夢想、賴我軍制事機先、早有嚴防、卒將敵主力擊潰而解大塲之危、惟渡浜之敵、爲數甚衆、現雖被困沿浜一帶、但野心仍未稍戢、致該方面戰事、仍在猛烈繼續中、故閘北我軍、爲牽制中路敵軍實力、及使敵疲於奔命計、於昨日入晚、我大隊空軍、及各地砲隊大施威力之際、突在全綫向敵猛烈進攻、並以裝甲車爲先導、聲勢浩大、敵望風披靡、而以寶山路·天通庵路、以迄八字橋一帶、爲尤烈、至晚八時許、北四川路之南北兩端、已爲我軍所控制、同時老靶子路北·橫浜路南·長春路西、亦完全處於我軍重重壓迫之下、敵倉皇棄械潰退、遺屍滿地、我軍目的旣達、大奏凱旋仍回守原陣地蟄伏六三花園之敵、突衝我八字橋、卒被我分兩路夾擊潰退、敵傷亡五十餘、</p>

<h3>我空軍夜襲建殊勳</h3>
<p>敵機塲彈庫均中彈起火　嘉興路橋附近敵屍徧地</p>
<p>昨晚六時起、以迄今晨六時止、在此十二小時內、我空軍前綫來滬夜襲虹口者、凡十一次、敵軍受創頗鉅、據軍息、楊樹浦敵機場中彈起火、燬敵機七架、今晨五時十五分、五時三十分之後、兩次來攻、收獲尤佳、建立殊勳、敵大阪碼頭彈藥庫及上海紗廠兵營均遭炸燬、死敵在三百以上云、</p>
<p>據外人方面消息、北四川路江灣路之敵海軍陸戰隊司令部、今晨又被我神勇之空軍予以重創　計着炸彈二枚、屋頂一角被燬、沿黄陸路牆脚所設之自來水管、亦損壤折斷、惟敵裝有三套水管、一時尚不致斷水、頃己僱工修理、由此亦證明我軍之彈無虛落也云云、</p>
<p>今晨七時十五分許、虹口狄思威路嘉興路橋附近一帶、草棚中、流彈甚多、頓時延燒草棚、不可收拾、後經救火會驅車馳往施救、歷三小時始熄、計焚去草棚四十餘間、該處發現敵屍徧地可見昨晚戰事之劇烈矣、</p>

<h3>敵機轟炸閘北浦東</h3>
<p>今晨迄午、本市上空、敵機軋軋之聲、已不若昨日之甚、蓋敵機昨遭我機襲擊已受重創、故不敢大事出動、僅上午八時半許、有敵重轟炸機六架、飛翔於閘北上空、我駐軍當卽開高射砲機槍掃擊、敵機遂亦高飛、在永興路及寶山路虬江路以北、至商務印書館以南一帶、亂投重量炸彈十五枚而去、除燬壤民房多間外、並無損失、嗣後敵機亦絕跡、又今晨九時許、敵機二十餘架、自東區起飛而來、經過二十分鐘後、又見十餘架續至、旋卽向西飛去、似係分往京滬滬抗沿綫肆虐、又十一時四十五分閘北上空、復出現敵重轟炸機三架、盤旋飛翔、時聞我高射機槍掃射之聲、敵機卒無低飛投彈之隙、移時復廢然而去、</p>

<h3>敵軍又將大舉增援</h3>
<p>華東社記者頃獲一可靠消息、卽敵方現又向上海大舉增援、謀作第五次總攻、其增援兵力己可證明者爲第三團所爲兩旅團、第六師團所屬之一旅團、暨已經抵滬之第十五師團餘部、人數亦有一旅團、此項援軍現集結大連、台灣兩處搭輪、約本月二十日前可抵滬、並悉、敵方俟援軍到齊後、將作第五次總攻、其迷夢在求滬戰急速結束也、故預料閘北大傷之綫、不久將有大戰展開、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>我國空軍每次出動。敵方驚惶失措。狠狽不堪。高射砲機關槍。無目的地亂放。但楚敵人天天在我內地。毫無防禦設備地帶。亂投炸彈其殘忍的表現。可謂無所不用其極了。惟此種炸彈。也不能算亳無價値。雖非個個打在我國人民的身上。却個個打在我國人民的心。裏泛起了各種抗敵的情緒。換言之多發一個炸彈。卽多增我國人民一重抗敵的堅次意志。故敵人欲以飛機炸彈威脅我國屈服。絕對萬無是理。我國偶然空軍夜襲。不過也使敵人嘗嘗這飛機炸彈的滋味罷了。</p>

<h3>“我們應該如何抗敵救國？”</h3>
<p>這是中國童子軍戰時服務第一團　宣傳處副處長劉育才在交通部　電台廣播之題目，茲將原詞錄之如下</p>
<p>諸位同胞；在今日我們的民族敵人，日本帝國主議者，又以武力侵略我們的平津，屠殺我們的同胞；現在又在上海吳淞江爾，到處轟炸我們的時候，眞正到了我們民族存亡的最後關頭，我看到聽到許多同胞，沒有一個不是在憤怒敵人的暴行，都在打算如何為國家民族的生存而奮鬥；我們看到在前綫抗戰的軍隊，如何忠勇地犧牲自己的性命，抵抗敵人的進攻；雖然戰爭的結果，現在還不能知道，可是這一切的表現，已證明我們能抗敵救國，並且保證我們能够獲得最後的勝利！所以我今天就來和諸位談談：我們應該如何抗敵救國的問題，我們政府對於敵人的態度，已經蔣委員長幾次明白剴切地昭吿於全世界，現在日本帝國主義者不斷地侵略我們，我們只有爭取國家的生存而奮鬥，我們只有實現蔣委員長的主張而抗敵；說到如何抗敵救國，我們可以分三點來說：第一：我們應如何正確的知這敵人力量有多少，這個問題，我們又可以分成三點，第一點：六年來敵人不斷的對我國侵略，尤其是最近敵人在平·津·上海·廣州·漢口·南京一帶的襲擊轟炸，已經最後一次的打碎了少數人以為日本帝國主義的侵略，還有止境的夢想；另一方面—這些慘痛的事實，又不免激起一部分同胞，把全日本人民都看成敵人的錯誤認識；我們要知道，侵略中國的是日本帝國主義，兇橫殘暴的是日本帝國主義的軍閥；至於日本人民，我相信大都還是愛好和平，擁護公理和正義的；我相信他們終有一天，會和我們携起手來，制裁他們橫行無忌的軍閥，打倒他們帝國主義的政治；最近日本國内的民衆，都起來反對他们軍閥政府的侵略中國了，這是一個有力的證明，但是我們劉於日本帝國主義和軍閥却决不應該再存有絲毫的空想，他們是只有覆亡於我們全民族革命戰爭的鐵血之下，那時才能收拾他們貪得無饜的野心，才能認識世間的公理和正義。第二：我們還有　些人，把敵人的力量，估計得太高，把我們自己的力量，估計得太低！他們所以要把敵人力量估計得太高，一方面是將敵人砲火的效力估計得太高，另一方面又相信日本可以在我國國民中，用威脅利誘的卑劣手段，收買許多人去做工具；關於現代戰爭中砲火的效力，我們在後面再來詳細的說明，現在就以上海的戰事而論，這是敵人處心積慮，至少計劃了一個月以後的行動，為什麽他們攻擊了兩個星期死傷的敵人由五百至三千人，還沒有攻下我們的上海呢？由此可見只要我們的將領和兵士，能忠勇愛國，不怕犧牲，相當的有點準備，就可以抵抗敵人武器的優勢，就可以打擊敵人外强中乾的輕舉妄動；同樣的我們在平津戰爭時的失敗，固然由於敵人武力的集中與衆多，然而亦由於我們自己的準備不够；否則敵人是不會這樣容易得手的。第三：另一方面又有些人，把敵人的力量估計得太低，以為只要我們的軍隊一還擊，敵人就得敗亡；這也是不合事實的想法；因為民族革命戰事，固然不能單靠武器的優良，但是我們至少得有决心有計劃，有準備，我捫要避免敵人之所長，以襲其所缺，利用我之所長，以攻其所短，因為抗敵是我們舉國上下堅毅一致的决心！週密具體的計劃，盡可能的充分準備和持久的大規範的抗戰；其次我們應如何正確的認識抗敵政策，我們現在所以要實行抗戰，完全是我們的敵人逼迫出來，我們並不是不愛好和平，正因為過去我們過於愛好和平，所以成為日本帝國主義侵略不已的對象，現在只有用抗戰手段，才能取得眞正的和平，才能使全世界的各民族獲得平等自由的生存發展之權利，因此我們的堅决抗戰，不是以一死了事，保全了個人的人格和國格就以為滿足，而是以少數人民犧牲，求得全民族無數人的永久生存。我們不是毀滅我們的民族和國家建設，使敵人即使佔領了全中國，亦毫無所得，而是要在敵人的侵略中，把無論未被或已被敵人侵吞了的地方，用我們堅强抗戰的手段，完全把敵人驅逐出去，而取得國家自由與平等！我們這個最後勝利的信心，决不是空想而是敎訓，所以這次中日戰爭的結果，只要我們澈底抗戰，失敗者必定是日本，最後勝利者必定是我國，從上面所說的看來，我們對於抗敵救國的辦法約有三點：第一·發揚我國民族抗戰精神，如同毀家紓難的令尹子文，為公不為私，申包胥的為國不為家，我們首先要把許多不良的觀念打破，譬如自私，不誠實怕死，為家不為國，明哲保身等等，這些觀念，如不消除凈盡，不留一點奴隸坯子，我們現在應該以“為公”代替“自私”，以“忠實”代替“不誠”，以“犧牲”代替“怕死”，以“戰死於戰場”代替“壽終正寢”；我們如果個個人做到只知有公不知有私，忠於國，忠於民族，不顧家庭，犧牲小我的生命，換取民族大我的生存，則我們的國家，必能從日本帝國主義的壓迫下獲得自由平等的地位；譬如土耳其和蘇聯的反抗戰爭，都是以民族抗戰的精神，而獲得勝利的最好榜樣；第二·我們要知道抗敵戰爭的進行，是一個長時期的艱苦巨大的工作，我們除了貢獻我們的身體到戰場上去奮鬪，還應該貢獻我們的金錢，財產給國家，以充足一切必要的戰費，最近張說，侵略主義的日本，他們的國民尚有捐助一百萬元五十萬元給國家的舉動，我們是被侵略的國家，我們是生死存亡之最後關頭的人民，所以我們更應該比敵人加倍踴躍的來毀家紓難努力購買救國公債，人人將他所有的銀錢，貢獻一大部分給國家，那末我們自然不怕財政困難，不怕我們沒有新式的武器來抵抗敵人了；第三·抗敵戰爭，無疑的是一個巨大的消耗戰爭，我們國民應該加倍的替抗戰節省私人用品，實行不供給原料與敵人，而將節衣縮食和生產所得的物品，完全集中到國家手裏去，這樣我們的抗戰，就可以持久，力量就可以加大了，內部固然有許多矛盾，士兵們都有畏縮怕死不願打仗的心理，但是亦必須在我們長久的抗戰與反攻之下，他們內部問題和矛盾，才能完全暴露出來，總之，我們對於敵人的力量，估計得太高或太低，都是錯誤的，估計太高了，結論只有等待亡國奴，或是甘心情願的做漢奸，估計太低了，不免要受許多不必耍的失敗和損失，反而增加了敵人的兇燄，因此我們對於敵人的正確估計，應該是敵人的物質力量並不可怕！我們必能戰勝！而這個必能戰勝的條件，就最近敵人已經在他們國內實行第七次的徵兵，並且增加戰費四五萬萬元，又宣傳要將卅個師團來攻擊我國；民國四年的時候，日本曾以動員軍隊嚇住了袁世凱，使他承認了他所提出的二十一條的大部分，同胞們現在已不是那個賣國政府的時代了，我們要動員四萬萬五千萬人，以答復牠動員三十個師團，我們要把精神，把金錢，把物力，都貢獻給抗敵戰爭上去，以拼死的戰鬥，打擊我們的敵人，現在世界上本無所謂什麼眞理及和平，誰的力量大，眞理和平就在那一邊，現在是我們全體國民為公理，為眞義，為和平，為生存，為國家，為民族，為自己子孫犧牲一切精神物質的最後關頭，要人人起來參加抗戰，方可生存，不然則亡，總理中山先生敎訓我們說：“安南有個大官，住在河南，呌做黃啟高，從前安南沒有亡國的時候，他做過了宰相的，所以他是升過了大官，發過了大財，因為他很有錢，所以他置在河南的產業，便非常之多，家中的花園，也非常之大，但是安南現在亡了，他就是做過了大官，發過了大財，還是要做法國的奴隷，國家亡了，要做外國人的奴隷，就是升官像黃啟高，發財也像黃啟高，要人不雇他是亡國奴，他還有什麼榮耀呢，國家之存亡，和我們人民有很大的關系，如果國家是强盛，大家便榮耀，國家要是衰弱，大家便恥辱”，中山先生的這段遺訓，也就是我今天貢獻給諸位、意見，希望全國人民都在政府的統一領導之下，實行堅强持久的民族革命的抗戰，敵人是不足怕的，一次二次的小失败，也是不足慮的，只要我们全體國民再接再厲的抗戰下去，勝利一定是我們的。</p>

<h3>Our Troops Yesterday Launched a Full-Scale Offensive on the Right Flank, Achieving a Great Victory and Directly Reaching the North Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>The Middle Section of North Sichuan Road is Entirely Under Our Troops' Control - Enemy Soldiers Killed by Our Guns and Swords Lie Scattered All Over the Ground - The Jiangwan Area Coordinated the Attack, Inflicting Heavy Losses on the Enemy - Our Air Force Assisted in the Battle Throughout the Night, Achieving Extraordinary Success</p>
<p>In the past week, the enemy has gathered the strength of its land, sea, and air forces to launch a full-scale offensive, attempting to seize our entire Songhu territory in one fell swoop and complete its occupation line stipulated by the January 28th Agreement. Our officers and soldiers, with the determination to defend to the death and a strategy of steady and sure fighting, have met them head-on on all fronts, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. The intensity of the fighting is unprecedented, and the Battle of Tangqiao, in particular, was the largest main force battle since the start of the war. The enemy's casualties were also unprecedentedly heavy. Yesterday at 5:00 PM, our military authorities, in order to change strategy from defense to offense, ordered the land and air forces to begin an offensive and large-scale clearing operation, starting at 5:30 PM. As of 4:00 AM this morning, our troops on all fronts have held an absolute advantage, and the enemy forces have been plunged into a bitter battle. It was particularly evident when our air force attacked several times, causing panic and urgency. The battle situation on each front is summarized as follows: ㊀ Our artillery units in Pudong and Zhabei simultaneously began firing at 5:30 PM, concentrating on the enemy's strongholds in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, bombarding them intensely. By a little after 6:00 PM, our troops in Zhabei, equipped with various light and heavy weapons, used extremely fierce firepower to launch simultaneous attacks from Dongbaoxing Road, Qiujiang Road, Guangdong Street, Zhongzhou Road, and other locations, with North Sichuan Road as their target, under the cover of artillery fire. The enemy forces responded in a panic. With the coordinated efforts of our artillery and infantry, the enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated. Our troops took advantage of the victory to advance, immediately occupying the section of Sichuan Road north of Laobazi Road and south of Yokohamabashi Bridge. Around 8:00 PM, after the enemy reinforcements arrived, they launched a counterattack. Fierce street fighting broke out in the Changchun Road, Xingjia Wooden Bridge, and Doulean Road area, lasting for two hours. Although the enemy repeatedly attacked us with tanks, they were repelled by our chasing artillery fire. The enemy's infantry positions were extremely chaotic. At that time, about 270 people were killed by us. As of 3:00 AM this morning, fierce fighting was still ongoing. At the same time, the middle section of North Sichuan Road was also completely under our troops' control. ㊁ Around 7:00 PM, our troops also launched attacks on the enemy's positions in the areas of Liusan Garden, Japanese Cemetery, and Patriotic Girls' School, resulting in over one hundred enemy casualties. Our troops had a significant advantage. Also, in the evening, about two enemy companies advanced towards our Fudan University from the Yejia Garden area. After an hour of fierce fighting, they were repelled by us. Around 6:00 PM, the enemy at the Sijing Ball Field suddenly attacked our Municipal Public Cemetery, but failed. As a result, over fifty of them were killed by us. ㊂ In the Yanjiawan area, from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM yesterday, there were twelve hours of fierce fighting. During the day, the enemy carried out large-scale bombing with artillery and aircraft. Our troops ignored it. Starting at dusk around 6:00 PM, we launched a large-scale offensive. After three hours of melee combat, the enemy suffered casualties of eight to nine hundred, and retreated in disarray. ㊃ The enemy northeast of Guangfu Town attempted to cross the Yangjing River stealthily, but failed. There were no fierce battles in the Shi Xiangong Temple area, and the enemy to the east of that location seemed to be retreating.</p>
<h3>Our Troops in Zhabei Yesterday Launched a Large-Scale Offensive and Achieved Victory</h3>
<p>The Middle Section of North Sichuan Road is Completely Under Control</p>
<p>Since August 13th, the positions of our troops in Zhabei and Jiangwan have remained unchanged. The enemy's Marine Corps has weak combat effectiveness, relying only on its strong headquarters as a base, constantly harassing us from North Sichuan Road and the Baziqiao Bridge on Jiangwan Road. We skirmished slightly, and the enemy hastily retreated. Therefore, for two months, every time when night fell and it was quiet, dense machine gun fire and the sound of hand grenade explosions could be heard emanating from that area. For nearly a week, the enemy suddenly developed major ambitions for the Dachan area. Therefore, every day, they densely bombed our Zhabei positions with airplanes and artillery, in order to contain our troop strength. We had long discerned the enemy's plan and responded calmly. Yesterday afternoon, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, we launched a large-scale offensive, which achieved its intended goal and swept away the enemy in the middle section of North Sichuan Road, resulting in a great victory. The detailed battle reports from each front are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Offensive by Land and Air Forces</p>
<p>Enemy planes bombing Zhabei had become almost a daily routine. Yesterday, from morning to night, the sound of bombing was incessant. However, our troops remained extremely calm. Having received the order to counterattack, they were all ready and waiting for the scheduled time to arrive to show off their skills. After the sun set, the enemy planes disappeared, and our troops began to move. First, the artillery from Zhabei, Pudong, and Dachan concentrated their fire on the enemy's positions in the Hongkou and Yangshupu area, hitting their headquarters, military bases, and ammunition depots, and aircraft fields. Enemy warships and artillery also returned fire. After about half an hour of mutual bombardment, night had fallen. Suddenly, anti-aircraft shells rose like a string of pearls in the sky above the Huangpu River, indicating that our air force had arrived in time to assist in the battle. Our troops, who had been pre-positioned in the streets of Zhabei, then jumped out of the trenches and advanced towards North Sichuan Road, with tanks leading the way. Their momentum was valiant, and those in their path collapsed. The enemy in Dongbaoxing Road, Qiujiang Road, Zhongzhou Road, and Guangdong Street retreated one after another. Our troops used fierce firepower to break through the enemy's defense line and advanced towards their intended destination. At 8:30 PM, according to reports from the Central News Agency's war correspondent, our advance units had crossed North Sichuan Road and reached Changchun Road, Xingjiaqiao Road, and Doulean Road. The enemy forces were frantically fleeing in all directions along the roads. We immediately used tanks to block both the north and south ends of North Sichuan Road, searching house by house. The enemy was unable to escape and those who died under our guns and swords lay scattered all over the ground, numbering over two hundred and seventy.</p>
<p>North Sichuan Road is Under Our Control</p>
<p>The Central News Agency's war correspondent reported for the second time at 12:30 AM that after our troops completed the first step of their plan, they advanced towards both ends of North Sichuan Road. At the time of the report, the area north of Laobazi Road, south of Yokohama Road, and west of Changchun Road was under our troops' control. In the Doulean Road area, a team of enemy tanks was still trying to resist stubbornly. After being heavily attacked by our troops, three of them were destroyed immediately. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the enemy also retreated in disarray. When our troops rushed to North Sichuan Road, some people on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek saw our loyal and brave soldiers patrolling the north bank, and the enemy corpses along the way were everywhere. The enemy's disastrous defeat can be imagined.</p>
<p>Coordinated Attack from the Jiangwan Area</p>
<p>In the Jiangwan area, we also launched a fierce coordinated attack. Starting at 7:00 PM, we advanced from Chizhi University and Guangdong Middle School towards the enemy positions at Patriotic Girls' School, Liusan Garden, and the Japanese Cemetery. The enemy lined up tanks in the middle of the road to block our advance. Our tanks then unleashed their power and charged fiercely at the enemy. After fierce fighting until 11:00 PM, the enemy finally could not withstand the attack and retreated to their positions in the rear, leaving a trail of enemy corpses along the way. On the Jiangwan Road front, around 4:00 PM, the enemy, with three tanks and two infantry companies, advanced towards our警戒 line north of Fudan University. Our outposts met them head-on, and reinforcements arrived continuously from the rear, engaging the enemy in a five-hour bloody battle. The enemy finally retreated towards their 美路 [Mei Road]. Also, around 6:00 PM, an enemy artillery team and an infantry company launched an attack from the Sijing Ball Field, attempting to seize our Municipal Public Cemetery position. We dispatched troops from Lujia Village and Hejia Alley to counterattack, holding out until about 8:00 PM, and finally repelled the enemy. In total, the enemy casualties in the three locations were over two hundred.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Displayed Great Power, Assisting in the Battle Over Shanghai Throughout the Night</h3>
<p>Enemy Forces Suffered Unprecedentedly Heavy Casualties</p>
<p>After our front-line soldiers routed the enemy's general offensive, they launched a counterattack on five fronts yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM. The air force also dispatched to assist in the battle. Around 6:00 PM in the dusky twilight, over twenty of our planes appeared in the skies over Shanghai, and the sound of their engines was extremely uplifting. Enemy warships hastily used searchlights to search for them and opened fire with anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns. However, our air force's skills were superb. They safely crossed the Huangpu River and carried out large-scale bombing of the enemy's positions in the Yangshupu and Hongkou area. They completed the attack in about half an hour. Around 7:00 PM, they flew over again to attack. At 9:00 PM, 10:50 PM, and again at 2:00 AM, 2:40 AM, 3:25 AM, and 3:38 AM this morning (15th), they bombed five more times, each time lasting for ten to twenty minutes. In total, our air force came to Shanghai seven times to assist in the battle. Amidst the enemy warships' dense fire, they used superior technology to complete their mission. Not a single plane was damaged, and all returned safely. According to information obtained from reliable sources by reporters, the enemy positions were heavily bombed by our air force. Because the bombing was accurate, the damage was unprecedentedly severe. Three bombs hit the enemy's airfield at the end of Yangshupu Road, destroying many enemy planes. The Shanghai cotton mill, which is Japanese-owned and now used as an enemy military barracks, was also hit by several bombs, immediately catching fire and burning until midnight. Enemy casualties were numerous, and they were in a state of disarray. A fire also broke out near the Huishan Wharf and spread. The telephone lines from Huishan Wharf to the Yulin Road police station were completely cut off. It is believed that this area is a major ammunition depot for the enemy, and the losses must be particularly heavy. In addition, one bomb each hit the Yangshupu Wharf, the Japanese Mail Line Wharf, the Osaka Wharf, and the vicinity of Wusong Road and the Hongkou Police Station. The enemy casualties were extremely heavy. According to unconfirmed reports, two enemy warships in the Huangpu River were hit and damaged. When enemy warships returned fire with anti-aircraft guns, stray bullets flew everywhere, causing over one hundred casualties.</p>
<h3>Remnants of the Enemy on the South Bank of the Wenzaobang Canal Attempt to Make a Final Struggle</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency's war correspondent in Jiangwan reported at 11:00 AM on the 14th that the enemy who crossed from Jiangjia Village to the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal had been entrenched in a corner since being severely battered by our troops yesterday morning, and had not dared to attack as of this morning, apparently waiting for reinforcements. However, surrounded by our troops on three sides, any attempt to break through is extremely unlikely. As for the remnants of the enemy in Gujia Village, they are still under our encirclement and surveillance, and we are waiting for an opportunity to advance and completely eliminate the remaining scum at the appointed time.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency's war correspondent in Jiangwan reported at 9:00 PM on the 14th that the enemy forces trapped in Gujia Village and Jiangjia Village on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal began to stir again at 1:00 PM, making a final struggle. Our troops took the opportunity to fiercely suppress them. The enemy stubbornly resisted until dusk, and then fled to their original positions. Our troops are now trying to cut off the enemy's rear route and then advance to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Desperately Attempts to Invade Pudong, Launching Six Sneak Attacks on the Chunjiang Wharf</h3>
<p>All Were Fiercely Repelled by Us in Disarray</p>
<p>Yesterday, from morning to dusk, the enemy launched a total of six attacks on Lujiazui and the Chunjiang Wharf, but failed to land a single soldier. At dawn at 6:00 AM, the enemy sent a small barge to the front of the Chunjiang Wharf, attempting to land. As it was strafed by our machine guns, it immediately fled. At 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM, two more small barges dispatched by the enemy first opened machine gun fire before reaching the wharf. Our troops initially ignored them. After about ten minutes, the enemy flagship Izumo suddenly signaled with flags, ordering the two barges to retreat quickly. The enemy warship停 at the Mitsubishi Wharf then launched fierce artillery fire on the Chunjiang Wharf. Our artillery also returned fire. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the enemy once again tried to probe, but still failed to land. As it approached 6:00 PM, the enemy, taking advantage of the darkness, sent an enemy warship No. 21停 at the Mitsubishi Wharf, a small enemy gunboat in the center of the Huangpu River off Lujiazui, and a barge loaded with enemy soldiers. While the two warships fired to assist and cover the barge, attempting to stealthily land at the Chunjiang Wharf, our night attack air force happened to arrive to bomb the enemy positions. At this time, enemy warships in the Huangpu River frantically fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, as densely as a string of pearls. Our artillery took the opportunity to fire large cannons. One shell hit Hongkou, immediately causing a fire that lit up the sky and burned fiercely. The enemy warships in the Huangpu River, in a panic, had to defend against our air force and return fire, firing towards Pudong. The soldiers attempting to land at the Chunjiang Wharf had to temporarily retreat. At 7:05 PM, enemy warships in the Qichang Wharf area used searchlights to illuminate the river surface. In an instant, our air force was heard to arrive again. At this time, the enemy soldiers who wanted to cross the Chunjiang Wharf urgently tried to land, but our troops had already made preparations and ultimately did not succeed.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Miaohang Failed Again</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency's war correspondent in Jiangwan reported at 9:00 PM on the 14th that after the enemy's defeat at Dachan, they had been transferring troops from the Yinheng area in the city center for several days, stationing them along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and west of the Nansitang Canal, forming a three-sided encirclement of our Miaohang area. However, our troops had been prepared early and were not threatened by them. This afternoon (14th), the enemy began to stir. At 時許 [Shixu = approximately 1:00-3:00 PM], the enemy attacked Miaohang in three routes. About two to three hundred enemy troops northeast of Cai Village, about three kilometers east of Miaohang, probed our Majia Village. Also, about two enemy companies from Houjia Ben Bridge probed our Xinzai. All were bravely repelled by our troops. At 時許 [Shixu = approximately 1:00-3:00 PM], about three hundred enemy troops in the area of Dongyanzhong Bridge Village, about three and a quarter kilometers northeast of Miaohang, advanced towards our Xiyanqiao Village and the northeast Shen Village area. The enemy troops in that area were exceptionally stubborn. After we met them head-on with fierce attacks and held out for four hours, the enemy repeatedly charged but failed, suffering over fifty casualties, and then retreated quietly. The enemy's repeated attacks seemed to be probing our troop strength. However, our defense is extremely tight, leaving no gaps to exploit. If the enemy attacks rashly, they will surely repeat the same mistakes as in the Battle of Dachan.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Dropped Heavy Bombs - The Tram Was Destroyed in a Tragedy</h3>
<p>Passengers Were Thrown Out of the Tram, Leaving Twenty-Four Dead and Injured - The Enemy Was Also Unscrupulous on the South Bank of the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2:15 PM, six enemy heavy bombers, divided into two teams, flew to the skies over Zhabei and dropped bombs in the area around the Maigen Road East Station and north of the Central Mint. They first circled in the sky for a moment, then wantonly bombed, dropping seven or eight bombs each time simultaneously. Therefore, the loud sounds were like thunder, rumbling continuously, and they were all heavy bombs with great explosive power. The doors and windows of houses in the special zone rattled. In total, there were thirty to forty bombs. Unexpectedly, around 2:40 PM, during the third bombing run by the enemy planes, they dropped two heavy bombs within the Shanghai West Maigen Road Changping Road concession area. One exploded in front of the Yong'an Cotton Mill, and the sound was heard far and wide. At that time, a No. 16 trolleybus was driving south to the place and immediately met a disaster. The first 1850 driver was blown to death on the spot. More than 30 passengers in the car were all shocked and thrown out of the car. Ten people died on the spot, including one Chinese policeman and one girl. Thirteen people were seriously injured, all of whom were in critical condition. Twelve people died in the evening. The car body was completely destroyed. Yong'an Cotton Mill and hundreds of domestic and foreign cotton mills within and outside were also shattered by the shock. It is sufficient to prove the weight of the two bombs and the explosive power. After the incident, the Bureau of Works sent an ambulance to rescue and collect the shrapnel for negotiation. The traffic there was stopped for about two hours at that time. A bomb was thrown on the door of Hongzhang Yarn Factory in the east of Yong'an Yarn Factory, which also caused the doors and windows of the factory to be damaged, and more than ten coolies were injured, and they were also sent to the hospital for treatment by the police car. It is found that this place is on the south bank of Suzhou River, far away from the bombing destination of the Japanese plane, and the river is separated, although it is clear and easy to distinguish at a very high altitude. Is it that the enemy air force did not see it because of shortsightedness, or deliberately slaughter innocent people?</p>
<p>Yesterday, at half past two, a Japanese plane flew over the Public Concession's Maigen Road on the Suzhou River and carried out a violent explosion. A number 16 trolleybus was blown up. At that time, more than 30 innocent people were killed and injured in the car.</p>

<h3>Many People Were Killed and Injured by Stray Bullets on the Suzhou River</h3>
<p>Who knows that misfortunes never come singly. At around 6:00 PM yesterday, when our right wing launched a general offensive against the enemy, the enemy was retreating steadily. Their artillery positions from Broadway Road to the Tilanqiao area were under great pressure and the situation was in danger. Therefore, in a panic, they used all their naval guns to bombard our rear, hoping to disrupt us. But the enemy's skills were too immature, and in their confusion, they had no target. A burst of indiscriminate bombing caused stray bullets to fly across both banks of the Suzhou River, injuring innocent people. Even 爱文义路 [Avenue Edward VII] and 虞洽卿路 [Yu Qiaqing Road] were hit by shells, which exploded and injured many people. Residents were panicked. The reports from various places are as follows:</p>
<p>Bullet Through the Wall</p>
<p>At 6:15 PM, the Pingqiao Hostel at 587 Lane 10 虞洽卿路 [Yu Qiaqing Road] (Yongji Lane), whose back door and usual entrance and exit were on 爱文义路 [Avenue Edward VII], was hit by a Japanese shell that flew from the northeast, hitting the wall between Room 20 facing 爱文义路 [Avenue Edward VII] and the hostel platform, blasting a large hole. Bricks, tiles, and iron pieces flew everywhere. Fortunately, there were no pedestrians below, so only a man in a hired car was injured by shrapnel. The 新闸 [Xinzha] police station sent a car to take him to the hospital for treatment, and collected the shrapnel to be kept on file for evidence.</p>
<p>Blood Stains on the Street</p>
<p>At about 6:30 PM, a similar shell flew from the northeast and fell on 虞洽卿路 [Yu Qiaqing Road] near 牯嶺路 [Guling Road], exploding immediately. At that time, there were pedestrians standing on the street, and about 20 people were injured by shrapnel on the spot. Blood stains were all over the road, and the road surface was also damaged. The glass of several nearby shops was also shattered by shrapnel. The scene was chaotic, with people screaming and running for their lives, or rushing to hide under the eaves of the street. The police station was informed and immediately sent an ambulance to take the injured to the hospital for treatment, and collected the shrapnel and washed the blood stains.</p>
<p>Cantonese Children Wounded</p>
<p>At about 6:00 PM, 33本白 [Benbai]四川路 [Sichuan Road] was also hit by a Japanese shell, which penetrated the roof, injuring the Cantonese children Chen Ruqian, 17 years old, Huang Genrong, 17 years old, Huang Youdong, 17 years old, and Huang Youjiu, 9 years old, who were living in the house, with shrapnel on their heads, hands, and feet. The police station was informed and sent a car to take them to the hospital for treatment, and collected the shrapnel to be kept on file. At the same time, a female pedestrian, Hong Xu, 34 years old, from 江北 [Jiangbei], was also injured in the foot by a stray bullet at the place and sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Five People Blown to Death</p>
<p>At about 6:00 PM, a Japanese shell fell in 桃源坊 [Taoyuanfang]北江西路 [North Jiangxi Road] and exploded. Several men, women, and children were injured in the head, hands, and feet, including Luo Jixiang, 16 years old, Tang Azhu, 38 years old, Hua Mingbiao, 19 years old, Zhang Lin, 26 years old, Fang Tingrong, 38 years old, Ge Shishou, 25 years old, and Li Ziqing, 10 years old. All were sent to the hospital by police car for treatment. In addition, there were stray bullets near 怡如里 [Yiruli] 北河南路 [North Henan Road], killing five people on the spot, including one woman, one girl, and three men. By the time the police discovered them, it was too late to save them, so their names could not be traced.</p>
<p>Police Station Hit</p>
<p>At about 6:00 PM, a stray anti-aircraft bullet fell on the roof of the west detective room of the 老閘 [Laozha] Public Concession Police Station, damaging a corner of the roof, but no one was injured.</p>
<p>Bullet Enters a Home</p>
<p>At 5:06 PM, at the gate of lawyer Dong Jingjiang at 16 大華里 [Dahuali] 南陽橋 [Nanyang Bridge] 白爾路 [Route Boell] in the French Concession, the enemy plane's bomb shrapnel destroyed the gate lamp and wall, as well as the doors and windows of the living room of the Wang family at No. 11 next door. At the same time, Hu Lingzi, an 8-year-old boy playing in the lane, was also injured in the left side of his body.</p>
<p>Heavy Casualties</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned men, women, and children killed and injured by stray bullets, the following people are being treated at the Renji Hospital: Wang Baosheng, 29 years old, Xu Maolin, 37 years old, Zhu Mengsheng, 20 years old, Zhu Jiemao, 40 years old, Fan Guifu, 43 years old, Feng Liben, 23 years old, Zhang Fuyi, 31 years old, Chen Yongdi, 16 years old, Gao Zhiqing, 48 years old, Niu Anan, 27 years old, Chen Deng, 35 years old, and a man whose name is unknown. There were also more than 20 minor injuries who went home after being bandaged, so there is no statistics. There were 1 old man, 3 girls, and 4 men who died and are currently being investigated for their names and the owners of their bodies. 76 people were sent to Baolong and other hospitals, of which 30 were hospitalized for treatment, 14 died from serious injuries, and the rest were slightly injured and discharged after bandaging. In addition, there are many other people whose names are unknown or cannot be investigated.</p>
<h3>Senior Commander Discusses Two Weeks of Bloody Battles</h3>
<p>Enemy Main Force's Four General Offensives Crushed, Resulting in 20,000 Casualties; No Longer Capable of Further Attacks</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on August 13th, the enemy deployed over half of its national land, sea, and air forces to invade Shanghai. Three general offensives were launched, all of which were met with fierce resistance, resulting in severe losses and demoralized troops. The enemy commander, Matsui, requested reinforcements from his home country for a fourth time. These reinforcements, including 40,000 infantry, several thousand cavalry, and a large number of mechanized units, arrived successively before the 28th of last month. This brought their total troop strength in Shanghai to 200,000. On the 29th, they launched their fourth general offensive, intending to push our forces back to the Jiading-Nanxiang line by the 15th of this month. The ensuing two weeks saw three bloody battles, with artillery fire of unprecedented intensity in the Far East. Despite the enemy's relentless attacks with their elite troops, our frontline fortifications remained impregnable, and our soldiers displayed unwavering morale and heroic spirit. On the 12th of this month, we crushed their main force attempting to cross the south bank of the Wenzaobang River, sweeping them away like fallen leaves in the wind. On the 13th, we pursued the victory and annihilated the remaining enemy forces. The heroic efforts of our brave Chinese soldiers over the past half-month have caused the Japanese invaders to suffer a crushing defeat, shattering their dreams of a fourth general offensive before the deadline even arrived. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter, amidst the jubilation of the victory, visited a certain senior commander at his headquarters to inquire about the battles of the past two weeks. A summary of the commander's account is as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy's Consistent Strategic Implementation</p>
<p>Central Breakthrough  　　　　Judging from the enemy's offensive plans, they have consistently adopted a strategy of central breakthrough, focusing their efforts on attacking our army's left flank positions from Luodian to Liuhang. They believed that breaking through this point would allow them to advance rapidly, threatening our right flank units in Miaohang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei, causing them to retreat without a fight. However, they failed to realize that our forces were firmly entrenched, taking a steady and methodical approach. Our entire line of defense was evenly distributed. Even if a breakthrough occurred at one point, we could launch a counterattack. At most, it would only result in the gain or loss of a village or two, without affecting the overall situation. The enemy, knowing only themselves and not their opponent, recklessly advanced and suffered defeat as a result.</p>
<p>Fierce Attacks on Luodian and Liuhang Repelled</p>
<p>Although the enemy's general offensive appeared to be launched along the entire front, with heavy artillery fire in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas, they were well aware of the strength of our right flank and refrained from attacking it lightly. Their primary objective was to break through our left flank positions. Their tactics remained consistent: first, heavy bombardment by aircraft and artillery, followed by infantry assaults shielded by tanks. Since the start of the bloody battles on the 25th of last month, the enemy had been firing thousands of artillery shells each day, with dozens of aircraft bombing us on each occasion. However, our loyal and brave frontline soldiers remained calm and composed. When the enemy launched their bombing raids, they held their positions and only returned fire with artillery. As soon as the enemy infantry advanced, they leaped out to meet them in fierce hand-to-hand combat. In the fierce fighting up to the 1st of this month, the enemy launched no fewer than seven or eight attacks each against the areas northwest of Luodian, including Shixianggong Temple and Caowang Temple, southeast of Luodian, including Caijiazhai and Shantangwan, west of Luodian, including Shenjiawan, and the front of Liuhang, including Gujiazhai in the southeast, Zhoujiaxiang and Xiwangzhai in the northeast, Tangjiabang and Chenxiang, and Taipingqiao and Baojialong in the north. All of these attacks were bravely repelled by our forces, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On the Luodian front, the enemy suffered over 3,000 casualties, while on the Liuhang front, they suffered over 1,000 casualties. Many enemy officers, including the regimental commander, Suzuki Hachiro, were killed in action. The intense fighting then subsided temporarily.</p>
<p>Breakthrough on the Highway and Westward Advance Thwarted Again</p>
<p>At this point, the enemy shifted their troops from the city center to reinforce their forces. From the 1st onwards, they concentrated their efforts on aerial and artillery bombardment, with artillery fire reaching hundreds of rounds per hour, an unprecedented level of intensity. Our fortifications suffered some damage, and our reinforcements were unable to advance due to the heavy fire. Taipingqiao and Doujialong were breached by the enemy. After annihilating the enemy, our forces withdrew 1,000 meters west of the Luodian-Liuhang highway. The redeployment was swift, and the enemy did not dare to advance to Liuhang until the 3rd. That evening, they rashly advanced towards Guangfu as their target, but were met with a fierce counterattack and retreated in disarray. They attacked again on the evening of the 4th and built fortifications in Xinmuqiao and Zhangjiazhai as their base. On the 8th, our army launched a counterattack and annihilated most of them. The survivors retreated to the side of the highway and defended along the ditch. At this point, the enemy abandoned their strategy of frontal assault and attempted to infiltrate the area near Mengjiazhai and Laoluzhai southeast of Guangfu Town, and Raojiazhai northeast of the town, but were repelled in several hand-to-hand combats. On the 9th, the enemy attacked again but failed. On Double Tenth Day, our army adopted an offensive posture and pushed forward. The enemy retreated again to the east of Di Jing, and their attempt to attack Guangfu was completely thwarted. As for Luodian, the enemy's attacks on the Shixianggong Temple area from the 1st to the 6th totaled as many as eleven. On the 4th, 5th and 6th, they even used inhumane poison gas in violation of international law, causing some casualties to our army. However, our army, determined to defend its positions to the death, remained steadfast. In contrast, the enemy suffered over a thousand more casualties under our bullets and bayonets.</p>
<p>Main Force Crossing Wenzaobang River Annihilated</p>
<p>When the enemy advanced to Guojiazhai, they went south along the highway in an attempt to cross the Wenzaobang River. On the 3rd, the enemy reached the bridgehead but was repelled by our counterattack. After suffering setbacks on the highway, their determination to cross the Wenzaobang River grew stronger. The enemy intended to cross the river and head straight for Dachang, then divide their forces to attack Zhenru and Nanxiang, cutting off the rear of our right flank. From the 4th, the focus of the battle shifted to both banks of the Wenzaobang River. The enemy continued to bombard our Dachang positions while repeatedly attempting to cross the river, but they were repelled by our forces while still halfway across. Before dawn on the 6th, the enemy succeeded in crossing the river in the heavy rain and darkness. Only a few hundred men crossed at Dongyangzhai and Jiangjiazhai on the west side of the highway, and they were completely wiped out by our forces on the 8th. However, on the east side of the highway, they used tear gas and crossed over to the Heida Huangzhai, Yangzhai, and Qianmentouzhai area, with several thousand men. Our army rushed to intercept them and engaged in three days of bloody battles. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, with only about a thousand remaining to hold out, but their rear was not cut off, and they received a steady stream of reinforcements, bringing their strength to an entire division. They pushed forward one kilometer to the Changshiqiaozhai. At dawn on the 11th, the enemy's main force, in a deep formation, launched a fierce attack on Dachang. Our army fought hard, but suffered considerable casualties. The enemy advanced about two kilometers until 9 o'clock. Our elite forces arrived as reinforcements and launched a desperate counterattack. At the same time, the left and right wings launched a flanking attack. The soldiers fought bravely and without retreat. The enemy was forced to break through and flee in a panic. The fierce fighting lasted until 5 pm, when the enemy was completely driven back to the riverbank. The intensity of this bloody battle was comparable only to the Battle of the Somme in World War I. The enemy's corpses littered the field, numbering over three thousand. The survivors were routed, and our army, taking advantage of the victory, continued to mop up, and it was not difficult to annihilate them.</p>
<p>Zhabei Stands Firm, Enemy Suffers 20,000 Casualties on the Entire Front</p>
<p>As for Zhabei and Jiangwan, the fighting had hardly stopped for two weeks. The enemy continued to bomb with aircraft and artillery, intending to turn the area into scorched earth. However, our fortifications suffered no damage. Not only did our positions remain steadfast, but we also made progress in several counterattacks. In the continuous infantry engagements, the enemy suffered about 2,000 casualties. In addition, our artillery in Pudong repeatedly displayed its power, striking the enemy's rear. In total, after half a month of bloody battles, the enemy suffered about 20,000 casualties on the entire front. If we include the past two months, the total is over 40,000. The exhausted enemy no longer has the strength to attack again. Although their fifth reinforcement division has arrived successively and joined the battle, it will not help. It is expected that if the enemy wants to launch another large-scale offensive, they will have to seek even more reinforcements.</p>

<h3>Aircraft Deployed to Aid the Battle; Our Army Achieves Great Victory in Northern Shanxi</h3>
<p>Ningwu Recovered; Enemy Retreats from Yangfangkou; Enemy Positions Near Yuanping Destroyed; Enemy's Route of Retreat Cut Off by a Certain Unit; Foreigners Confirm That the Shanxi War Situation Has Completely Changed</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Following our army's great victory on the 13th, we pursued the fleeing enemy. At dawn on the 14th, all routes coordinated a general offensive, with dozens of our aircraft flying ahead to assist in the battle, coordinating with our infantry and artillery to pursue the retreating enemy. By noon, we had completely destroyed the enemy's artillery positions near Yuanping, capturing many cannons and killing countless enemies. Another route of our forces was encircling and annihilating over 2,000 enemies in Gongjiazhuang.

<p>[Nanjing] The following is a long-distance telephone report from a reliable foreigner in Taiyuan. The counterattack by the Chinese army in the Yuanping area of northern Shanxi is extremely victorious. The Chinese army is advancing step by step. Reinforcements arrived in northern Shanxi a week ago, most of which were central troops. Afterwards, they intensified their preparations for a counterattack, and yesterday they began to move out, dividing their forces into three routes, with Yuanping as the center, Ningwu as the left wing, and Wutai as the right wing, and at the same time attacking north, killing the enemy to great effect. It is reported that the Japanese army has been溃退 into disarray and cannot form an army. The war situation in Shanxi has completely changed. (Central News Agency dispatch, Reuters, 14th)</p>

They harassed Shaoguan to the northwest, but were also repelled by our road protection team and did not drop bombs. At 11:20 AM, thirty-two enemy aircraft flew from Chixi Yamen to attack the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, with the Shilong Iron Bridge as their target. However, our air defense was solid, and the enemy failed to succeed. They only haphazardly dropped bombs at Tutang Station, destroying a small section of the railway tracks. Both noon and evening trains are out of service. Repairs are expected to be completed and traffic will be restored on the 15th. Part of the provincial-Hong Kong long-distance telephone line was also bombed and cut off. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>

The two railway bureaus sent personnel to repair the damage, but it is still uncertain when traffic will resume. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is a joint Sino-British venture and the only trade route for all countries in South China. The bombing of this road proves that the false pretense of the brutal Japanese to protect the interests of third countries has been exposed by themselves, and their cruel and avaricious faces of wantonly destroying our country's and other countries' interests and businesses have been completely exposed.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Flies from Philippines to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Staying at the Peninsula Hotel, Meets Chinese and Foreign Reporters; Expresses Absolute Confidence in Our Long-Term Resistance</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, arrived safely in Hong Kong by plane from the Philippines at 4:15 PM on the 14th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Kong Xiangxi, along with Tang Hai'an, Li Jianwu, Wang Yongquan, and Yuan Chaobo, arrived in Hong Kong by special plane from the Philippines at 4:10 PM on the 14th. Zeng Yangfu and representatives from the Hong Kong Governor's office, among others, welcomed them at the airport. The representatives of the Hong Kong Chinese community hosted a banquet to welcome them. The Hong Kong Governor has scheduled a meeting for the 15th to host them. Kong mentioned that when he was in Manila, Hugessen happened to be in Zamboanga City and they talked on the phone but did not meet. Japan's invasion of China is not only against us, but against the world. Chinese territory must be returned to China, which is an indisputable principle. The Japanese people are poor and have exhausted their resources, so it is impossible to conquer China. We have borrowed a large amount of cash from abroad, and all countries in the world have become our creditors, so our economic strength is sufficient to sustain a long-term war. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Vice President Kong was previously dispatched to England to attend the coronation ceremony of the King of England. He left the country in April of this year. After completing his mission in England, he went to various countries in Europe and America for inspection, in order to provide a model for our construction. He was well received wherever he went. When he heard about the Sino-Japanese Incident, he hurried back to the country to share the national crisis. Kong boarded the Victoria Wheel from Italy last month and arrived in the Philippines on the 13th. He temporarily changed his plans and took the Pan American Airlines clipper Hong Kong, together with Tang Hai'an and other four people, to Hong Kong on the morning of the 14th, arriving at Kai Tak Airport at 4:10 PM. Those who went to welcome him were Wu Zixiang, representing Wu Tiecheng, Zeng Yangfu, and Wu Jiantao, and more than a hundred people. Hong Kong's Acting Governor Smith also sent personnel to pay tribute to Kong and take care of everything. Kong was full of energy and as elegant as ever. After getting off the plane, he greeted the welcomers one by one, and then went to the Peninsula Hotel for rest and to meet with Chinese and Western journalists. According to him, Japan's provocation is not against China, but against the League of Nations. The League of Nations should fulfill its obligations to China, which is being invaded, and provide assistance to it. The Japanese so-called "Asia for Asians" is actually "Asia for the Japanese," and its purpose is to rule China and dominate the world. China has a vast territory, and everyone has the determination to sacrifice, and is absolutely confident in the long-term resistance. The date of my trip to Beijing has not yet been decided.

Kong was traveling on the specially chartered Hong Kong Clipper, but the plane returned after departing this morning due to bad weather, but soon took off again. It is said that before the event, everyone knew that Kong would stay here until Saturday as a guest of Philippine President Quezon, so the news of Kong's departure surprised everyone.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Rapidly Build the Industrial Foundation for the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Sun Huairen</p>
<p>Throughout, many people in the country have seemingly held two different views regarding the issue of China's economic construction. One group advocates for China to "establish the nation through agriculture," while the other advocates for "establishing the nation through industry." In reality, for a modern nation to completely abandon industry and focus solely on agricultural development is almost impossible, except for colonies. Similarly, to completely abandon agriculture and only focus on industry is not a very accurate theory for China, where the majority of the population is agricultural. Therefore, my personal consistent view is that China's economic construction does not need to tout "establishing the nation through agriculture" nor raise the banner of "establishing the nation through industry." China's need to establish an industrial foundation is an undeniable fact. The so-called "agricultural China, industrial Japan" theory can only be said to be a delusion of Japanese imperialists and those who welcome Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. However, in order to establish the foundation of our national industry, we also naturally need to improve our agriculture and revive our rural purchasing power. In this way, we can both produce the raw materials needed by our own industry and expand the outlets for our industrial products.</p>
<p>I believe that this parallel construction of industry and agriculture is not only necessary during peacetime but especially so during the current period of the war of resistance. Moreover, this is also a very good opportunity. However, recently, some people have actually been advocating that the economic foundation of the war of resistance lies in agriculture, and they argue that there is no need to rapidly build industry or move coastal industries inland. The sole basis for these theories is that industrial construction is not easy and that China is a major agricultural country. Therefore, they advocate not discussing industry during the war of resistance. These words seem very appealing on the surface, but in essence, they are a kind of unambitious and lazy theory. If our current war of resistance were still in the "Green Dragon Crescent Blade era" of thousands of years ago, then perhaps we would only need sufficient agricultural food to sustain our resistance against the enemy. However, it is different now. A modern war relies not only on agriculture but also requires the mobilization of all industrial sectors. In this full-scale war of resistance, we do not deny the need to quickly seize the opportunity to adjust our agriculture so that the food problem during the war of resistance does not encounter a serious crisis. However, to say that industrial construction is not needed beyond agriculture is simply wrong.</p>
<p>In the past, China's industry had only a very weak foundation after more than seventy years of industrial revolution, partly because of the disunity of domestic politics and partly because of the unbridled dumping of goods by imperialists. Now, after the start of the war of resistance, we have deeply tasted the pain of industrial self-insufficiency. The longer the war of resistance lasts, the deeper this pain will naturally be felt. Therefore, in order to enable the war of resistance to continue for a long time, it is absolutely necessary to grit our teeth and build industry at present, and there is no room for any doubt.</p>
<p>In fact, building industry now is not only necessary but can also be said to be the right time. We have been advocating for the promotion of domestic goods for two or three decades, but what results have we achieved so far? To be honest, if China had not had the good fortune of World War I, it probably would not even have this weak industrial foundation it has now. In other words, to eliminate the obstacle of the dumping of goods by imperialists in industrial construction, it is definitely not enough to rely on the moral preaching of "promoting domestic goods." The most important thing is the material environment. Now that the war of resistance has begun and foreign trade is about to be cut off, especially the cheap Japanese goods, can no longer rampage in the Chinese market. This environment is more helpful to China's industrial construction than singing the praises of domestic goods for thirty years. If we do not take advantage of such a great environment, it is simply abandoning ourselves. Moreover, the domestic politics has now shown unprecedented great unity, which can be of great help to industrial construction.</p>
<p>Although the environment is very good for us to build industry now, there are still difficulties naturally. These difficulties—whether in the means of production or in technology—can be overcome as long as we can make up our minds to build now as soon as possible. In other words, the government should immediately and strictly formulate an industrial construction plan, determine the minimum types of industry that should be available during the war of resistance, and then, according to this regulation, quickly import as much as possible all the industrial means of production needed from overseas while the war has not been formally declared and the enemy cannot block all peaceful trade with China. On the other hand, the government should quickly concentrate the existing industrial means of production needed in the country in safe areas. At the same time, the government should have an emergency call for technical talents for industrial construction. If there are no such technical talents in the country, then it should immediately find ways to borrow foreign experts. No matter what the difficulties are, we can definitely overcome them as long as we are determined to act quickly now.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of investment in industrial construction, I advocate that heavy industry should be state-owned. Steel, fuel, machinery, and metal industries should all be invested by the state. The remaining industries may be operated by private investment. Wise national industrialists, I think, will certainly not be indifferent to profits as long as the government can come up with a concrete plan for industrial construction. As for the state's own investment, domestic debt is certainly possible, and foreign debt may also be possible. At present, as long as funds can be obtained, even if the terms of issuing debt are a little harsh, it does not matter as long as the national sovereignty is not harmed. In short, everything now should be based on maintaining the war of resistance as the primary meaning. If the current war of resistance has to be stopped halfway due to material conditions, then aren't we all finished?</p>
<h3>U.S. Plans to First Attempt Mediation in Sino-Japanese Dispute</h3>
<p>If Mediation Fails, Practical Actions Will Be Taken; Responsible Parties Explain President’s Speech; Nine-Power Treaty Conference is Approaching</p>
<p>[Washington] After President Roosevelt delivered his broadcast speech yesterday, responsible parties have explained it, stating that its purpose is twofold: ⑴ Regarding the Far East issue, the public, mindful of the events of the European war, is deeply concerned that President Roosevelt is repeating the mistakes of the late President Wilson. Roosevelt therefore delivered a speech to reassure the public, stating that he is well aware of the public's unease, but that he once served in President Wilson's government (President Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy), and based on his personal experience, he knows how to avoid past mistakes. ⑵ Regarding the mission of the future Nine-Power Treaty Conference, President Roosevelt explained in yesterday's speech the views held by the U.S. government. In essence, the primary task of this conference is to find ways to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. According to information received by the State Department, although the attitude of the Japanese military is still as resolute as ever, the Japanese government may be willing to accept a compromise. U.S. current policy is based on this hope, and therefore, before taking practical coercive measures, it has decided to exhaust all methods of mediation in order to find a solution. As for the U.S. government considering further practical measures if the Nine-Power Treaty Conference's mediation fails, such as severing commercial relations with Japan, that is one possibility. However, before taking such measures, the U.S. government must obtain assurances that other countries will not take advantage of the opportunity to replace the U.S. exporters after they stop trading with Japan. In short, President Roosevelt intended to explain that although the U.S. is currently cooperating with other countries, it is doing so within the framework of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and is limited to the Sino-Japanese dispute. The U.S. has no intention of taking joint action with other countries on other international issues. As for the development of the current tense situation in the Mediterranean, the U.S. official circles are still closely monitoring it. (Central News Agency, Havana, 13th)</p>
<p>⊙Boise City, Idaho: U.S. Senator Borah stated that it is highly doubtful whether Japan can be subdued by peaceful means, and it is also uncertain whether Japan will participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. However, he finally declared, "If peaceful methods are of no effect, then we should take any effective measures." (National News, 13th)</p>
<h3>We Draft a Report on Enemy Atrocities</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Diplomatic sources say that the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries' conference to deal with the Sino-Japanese dispute has decided to be held in Brussels on the 25th. The Belgian government is expected to reply to the League of Nations, expressing its agreement. Except for Japan, which will refuse to participate, all other signatory countries have prepared to send representatives. In addition to sending representatives, our government will also prepare a detailed report on the enemy's recent aggression and aerial bombing of civilians, which will be submitted to the conference. The preparations for the conference are being exchanged among the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Canada Decides to Send Representatives to the Meeting</h3>
<p>⊙Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King stated today that Canada is prepared to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and declared that Canada will participate in responsible and cooperative joint mediation work in order to resolve an extremely difficult situation. We deeply hope that no other incidents will occur that will impede or make the work of the conference more difficult. King also stated that because the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be convened soon, the current suggestions aimed at stopping the aggressor or ending the conflict should be temporarily set aside, as unilateral action by one country may hinder the prospects of the conference. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Attitude Remains Savage</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The hostility of the newspapers here towards the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is increasing day by day, and they are extremely indignant at being called "aggressors in the Far East." They declare that if Brussels further denounces them, then Japan will abolish all obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty. The newspapers are attacking the United Kingdom with impunity. (Haitong News, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Discusses the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Boycott of Japanese Goods Rejected</p>
<p>[London] The Cabinet held a routine meeting this morning to discuss the latest developments in the Far East situation, paying particular attention to the situation of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which will be held in Brussels, Belgium, on the 25th or 26th of this month. The United Kingdom will be represented by Foreign Secretary Eden as the chief representative, along with nine other representatives. It is reported that the Cabinet also discussed the boycott of Japanese goods, and the result was that it was unanimously rejected. This is because the Cabinet still believes that the United Kingdom must maintain its non-intervention policy for as long as possible. (Central News Agency, Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>[London] People from all walks of life in London today discussed the Japanese invasion of China again. At the autumn conference of the British Chamber of Commerce in Manchester, Sir Clarke, chairman of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, expressed his opinion, advocating that a calm mind should be maintained towards Japan and that hasty decisions should be avoided. He said that sanctions and bans on trade with other countries are ultimately ineffective. We have already tasted this bitter experience. We do not want to repeat the same mistakes. Sir Sinclair, a Liberal Party Member of Parliament, spoke at the Berwick Liberal Party meeting, urging countries with interests and responsibilities in the Far East to first ask Japan to stop its war against China and submit its disputes to a third party for judgment. He also said that countries should explain that they understand that Japan has its legitimate demands and that they are willing to provide Japan with satisfaction through peaceful means, such as restricting Japanese immigration and high tariffs in foreign markets. If, unfortunately, Japan refuses to accept this proposal, then we should adopt a method of cutting off relations. The Daily Herald reported that Japan, fearing world public outrage, is gradually stopping its large-scale bombing of Chinese civilians, but the truly sinful war is still ongoing. It would be sad if the world thought that the most egregious acts have been restrained and then felt at peace with its conscience. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>Urges Workers Around the World to Rise Up in Unity; British Church Protests Japanese Air Raids</p>
<p>⊙Denver, USA: The annual meeting of the American Federation of Labor today unanimously voted to join the British labor movement to boycott Japanese goods in retaliation for the Japanese's barbaric and systematic massacre of Chinese civilians in China. It also passed a report, expressing its purpose of expanding the boycott movement beyond the borders of the United Kingdom and the United States, uniting with trade unions in other countries to take concerted action. The report also acknowledged that the joint action of all peace-loving countries is a necessary condition for preventing unjustified acts of aggression, but "the people of the United States and the free labor movement are determined not to purchase Japanese goods under the current circumstances, so that Japan's financial resources will be strengthened as a result." Speakers at today's meeting included Labor Federation President Green and Vice President Wool. (Central News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The Council of the Seafarers' Union here today convened members to discuss ways to boycott Japanese goods. (National News, 13th)</p>
<p>⊙Bristol, England: The United Federation of Christian Churches of England held a conference here, which passed a resolution expressing regret for the killing of non-combatants in China. The resolution stated, "The Japanese army continues to bomb Chinese cities and towns, killing a large number of non-combatants. These terrorist and brutal actions are intolerable to the civilized world and are condemned. The recent resolution passed by the 52 member states of the League of Nations, which issued a strong protest against this kind of action, is supported by this conference. This conference will also support the British government should it take any measures with other countries to make the above-mentioned protest effective. This conference also requests the government to initiate a proposal to make all countries in the world rise up and completely abolish aerial bombing." (Central News Agency, Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3>Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War to Reconvene Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Britain and France Accept Italy's Request; Discussing the Withdrawal of Volunteer Soldiers</p>
<p>[London] The Cabinet held a routine meeting this morning and, in addition to the Far East issue, discussed the Spanish issue. It was decided to accept the Italian government's request to refer the issue of the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from Spain to the Adjustment Committee for handling, and it was proposed that the Committee should meet on Saturday of this week (the 16th) to handle this issue promptly. However, it is reported that the majority of the members firmly insisted that the Committee's discussion period should not be limited, so as not to give Italy the impression of being presented with an ultimatum. In addition, the Cabinet, it is reported, continued to oppose the lifting of the ban on arms shipments to Spain, because the Cabinet still believes that the United Kingdom must maintain its policy of non-intervention for as long as possible. (Central News Agency, Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>[London] Official sources recently announced that after the Adjustment Committee meets in the coming days, if an agreement is reached on the issue of the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers, then an investigative team will be sent to Spain to monitor the withdrawal of foreign volunteer soldiers. As for the relationship between the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers and the recognition of both sides in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents, the United Kingdom has not changed its original view, namely, that the issue of recognizing belligerents can only be considered after the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers has actually been achieved. (Central News Agency, Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Official sources recently announced that if an agreement on the principle of withdrawing volunteer soldiers cannot be reached quickly, then Britain and France will declare the restoration of complete freedom regarding non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. This declaration will be contained in the speeches delivered by the British and French representatives to the Adjustment Committee. (Central News Agency, Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to opinions from political circles here, Germany and Italy are willing to make every effort to resolve the Spanish volunteer soldier issue to the best of their ability. However, the time limit for the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War to discuss this issue is questionable, as this issue involves many difficult details and is related to many other governments besides Germany and Italy.

<h3>Italy Increases Troops in North Africa</h3>
<p>Reaching 30,000 Troops in Less Than a Month</p>
<p>⊙Naples: While Britain and France are exchanging views on the serious situation in the Mediterranean, Italy is now strengthening its forces stationed in Tripoli and Libya. It suddenly released a bulletin last night stating that the command of the Italian Sirte Division has opened in Tripoli. This came as a surprise to many, as the division had not previously indicated that it was opening in Tripoli or had arrived there. Thus, the Italian army stationed in Tripoli has increased from three divisions to four divisions. At the same time, 4,000 Italian soldiers are opening in Libya. In less than a month, Italy has deployed approximately 30,000 troops to North Africa. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>Purchase of National Salvation Bonds with Checks Not Restricted</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance recently issued an order to the provincial and municipal governments, chambers of commerce, silver and money industry associations, and banks, etc., stating that if people open checks with deposits in silver and money shops to purchase National Salvation Bonds, the general and branch associations for the promotion of National Salvation Bonds or their collection agencies may, after verifying that the deposits are correct, accept the checks and stamp them on the back, and then take them to the related shops for withdrawal and reporting, without being restricted by the measures to stabilize finance. From now on, the procedures for the people to contribute funds to purchase bonds will be more convenient, and the promotion will be easier to achieve. It should not be difficult to raise the full amount in the shortest possible time. (Central News Agency, 14th)</p>

<h3>Coming and Going in the Bombing</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>㊅</p>
<p>In the dusky garden, Zhenru told me a story:</p>
<p>“The artilleryman of January 28th”—Wu Luxun, divorced his Japanese wife and went to the front lines in North China.</p>
<p>I feel that this is a very good dramatic material. I am now providing some materials and hope that someone in the current drama circles, which are suffering from a shortage of scripts, can dramatize it.</p>
<p>Wu Luxun is a graduate of the Japanese Army Academy, a native of Guangdong, with a sturdy physique, and only about thirty years old. During the "January 28th" incident, he was the commander of the old 19th Route Army. On the night of "January 28th," when his Japanese wife gave birth to his first son, he fired the first cannon at the Japanese soldiers in Zhabei.</p>
<p>After the old 19th Route Army dispersed, he traveled in Europe. The year before last, he revisited Japan. I met him at that time, and I also met his wife several times. His wife loved him very much, and he loved his wife very much. Soon they returned to Guangdong.</p>
<p>When I returned to Shanghai this year, Luxun had just come down from Lushan and was about to return to Guangzhou. We met in Shanghai again. At that time, he told me that he was very concerned about his wife and that his wife was about to have her third child. After returning to Guangzhou, he sent a letter reporting that the third birth was also a boy.</p>
<p>Not long after we parted, the overall situation of the War of Resistance against Japan unfolded. Unexpectedly, in just two months, he divorced his wife and ran to the forefront of North China.</p>
<p>According to Zhenru, the divorce was mutually agreed upon. Zhenru was a witness for them at their divorce banquet. The two boys and one girl were taken away by his wife.</p>
<p>Luxun's wife said at the banquet: Luxun, you are a soldier. At this critical time of national crisis, it is precisely when you should serve on the battlefield. Please don't worry about me. Although I am a woman born in Japan, I completely oppose the aggressive and bestial behavior of the Japanese military. I will do my best to raise your children, make them inherit your ambitions, and make them forever Chinese children.</p>
<p>Isn't this a tragic drama?</p>
<p>Luxun could have stayed in Guangzhou to fulfill his duties, but he went to the forefront of North China. This state of mind is worth considering.</p>
<p>Hearing Zhenru tell me in the dusky garden, I felt excited, but I also felt a knowing smile...</p>
<p>——With such soldiers in China, China will absolutely not perish!</p>

<h3>British Military Officer Shot At, Okamoto Fabricates and Quibbles</h3>
<p>Claims it was difficult to identify from the air, mistaken fire. A driver previously drove the British Ambassador's ill-fated car.</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that British Aviation Captain Murray recently came to Shanghai from Beijing and was suddenly attacked by Japanese aircraft. British expatriates are extremely indignant about this case. The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Okamoto, went to the British Consulate in Shanghai yesterday afternoon to express his condolences to the British Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, and fabricated and quibbled, saying that it was difficult to identify from the air, resulting in mistaken fire, in an attempt to shirk responsibility. Although Captain Murray was not injured, he was greatly frightened. According to British Consul Baut, who spoke to Shenshi News Agency reporters yesterday morning, the date of Captain Murray's return to Beijing has not yet been determined and he may take a short rest in Shanghai. According to reporters, the car driving Murray to Shanghai had two Chinese drivers, one of whom was also the driver when British Ambassador Hugessen encountered an accident on his way to Shanghai. This time, he encountered this misfortune again, which can be said to be extremely coincidental, but it also shows that the Japanese side disregards justice and intentionally bombs people from third countries.</p>
<p>Solid Evidence of Intentional Shooting</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the situation of Japanese aircraft shooting at the British Embassy's car with machine guns was announced yesterday by the British authorities. However, one thing that was not mentioned, but was discovered by the Continental Daily and made people feel very strange, was that there were a total of three cars in the convoy that day. The first two cars were driven by the Russian Fedtinghof, because Fedtinghof had driven between Beijing and Shanghai several times and was familiar with the road conditions. According to Fedtinghof's interview with the Continental Daily reporter, the route he took was in full accordance with the advance notice to the Japanese authorities, without any deviation. Fedtinghof's car belonged to the American Tong Automobile Company, was painted gray, and had no special markings. His car was about half a mile ahead of the remaining car. He first saw the Japanese aircraft suddenly descend and make a shooting motion. Fedtinghof immediately stopped the car and jumped into the ditch beside the road with several people in the car to avoid it. The ditch water was almost up to his neck, but the Japanese aircraft did not fire machine guns at them, but instead fired at the car behind with the British flag painted on the roof, resulting in numerous bullet holes in the car. This car was painted a deep chestnut color, which looked like black from a distance. The flag on the roof must have been clearly visible at a high altitude. The car that Captain Murray was riding in was the last car, and the color of the car body was relatively black. Why did the Japanese aircraft only pay attention to this one car? If it is said that they did not see the first car, then why, ten minutes after the incident, was the car sent by the Shanghai Soviet Russian Consulate to tow Sahagoff's car, which had broken down about five miles from Songyue, also seen and attacked with machine guns? This is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Cables International Chamber of Commerce to Implement Economic Sanctions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cabled the International Chamber of Commerce today, saying: The International Chamber of Commerce appreciates that the Japanese are determined to monopolize China's resources and destroy the markets of various countries in the Far East. Therefore, economic sanctions against Japan are the way to maintain world commercial prosperity and uphold common interests. Now world public opinion is gradually paying attention to this point. It is hoped that your association can support this move with the authority of the business community for even greater results.</p>
<h3>British Ship Danny's Chinese Staff's Letter to British Fleet Chinese Staff</h3>
<p>Donate one-tenth of monthly salary for long-term resistance donation</p>
<p>The British Ship Danny Chinese Staff Long-Term War of Resistance Salary Donation Committee yesterday published a letter to the British Far East Fleet Chinese Staff for national salvation. The original text reads: The Japanese bandits are swallowing our land, slaughtering our compatriots, and destroying our sovereignty. Their evil intentions and violent actions are unprecedented in the history of ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. If our conscience is not completely dead, if our people are not willing to be slaves, then we can only be determined to coexist with the country and perish with the country, and unite to resist and fight a desperate battle with the violent Japanese. However, this determination is not just a slogan in our hearts. We must have a planned and persistent effort to do it. In the sound of this all-out war of resistance, our loyal and brave soldiers are fighting the strong enemy with their flesh and blood, all for the sake of the country's happiness and for the survival of the nation. Then can we freely and leisurely live outside? Brothers, you must know that when the nest is overturned, there will be no intact eggs. When the country is subjugated, who is not a slave? However, most of our comrades serving on the ship have not received military training. They cannot go to the front line to kill the enemy, nor are they willing to sit idly by and watch the country's subjugation. Then what work should we do? In terms of job and environment, it is best to work together to raise donations to fulfill the national duty. However, we believe that in this enthusiastic anti-Japanese national salvation, your ship's departments must have already actively donated. But we say that this war of resistance is definitely not the partial war of resistance or the short-term war of resistance of the past, but an all-out war of resistance and a long-term war of resistance. Therefore, a moment of generous donation is not a thorough way to help the country's war of resistance. My ship's colleagues, in view of this, unanimously decided that from September, all Chinese staff will donate one-tenth of their monthly salary as long-term resistance damage. In this way, it seems that it is a drop in the bucket and the effect is minimal. But if we gather a little, we can make a lot, and if everyone helps, it will be easy. If this method can be approved by all comrades of your ship and act in unison, and then spread to all ships, and then spread to the entire nation, then who else can win the final victory? Comrades, get up! Enemy soldiers are constantly ravaging everywhere, and enemy planes are constantly bombing everywhere. Now we can no longer hesitate. Victory or defeat, survival or death, is at stake. Please get up and implement salary donation for national salvation! We sincerely and earnestly await your good news, and pay the highest respect to the national war of resistance and national salvation, etc. It is reported that the British Far East Fleet has more than 8,000 Chinese staff. Their patriotism is extremely enthusiastic. In the past, they have donated thousands of yuan for war of resistance expenses. Now they are launching long-term salary donations to show their determination to fight a long-term war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Compatriots in Shanghai Express Determination to Refuse to Return to Taiwan at All Costs</h3>
<p>Enemy intends to force Taiwanese compatriots to return home to join the army. Conspiracy is exposed and will not be deceived.</p>
<p>Recently, the Taiwan Guild issued a notice, roughly stating, "Now we have received an order from the Japanese Consul in Shanghai that all Taiwanese residents in Shanghai, regardless of gender, age, or age, must complete the procedures for returning to Taiwan for registration within days, and each person will be given 60 yuan in cash as travel expenses." According to the notice, just as it was published, various Taiwanese revolutionary groups issued a declaration calling on all overseas Chinese to quickly awaken and actively participate in the anti-Japanese front of the motherland, overthrow the common enemy, and seek freedom and liberation. It can be seen that the purpose of the notice is obviously a new conspiracy by Japanese imperialists to undermine the great unity of the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. In the war of aggression against China, in order to supplement its troop strength that has suffered major losses, Japan will inevitably use shameless means such as threats, inducements, and disintegration to force our Taiwanese compatriots to return to Taiwan to join the army and come to the motherland again to become cannon fodder. A few days ago, 60 Taiwanese compatriots were forced to come to Shanghai, and then they were monitored by Japanese soldiers and went to the front line to transport military supplies and wounded soldiers. This proves that if they return to Taiwan, they will definitely be incorporated into the army. Therefore, most Taiwanese compatriots in Shanghai have deeply understood this conspiracy and now express their determination to refuse to return to Taiwan at all costs and will no longer be deceived and used.</p>
<h3>Workers' Long-Term Purchase of National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>All Circles Work Hard to Purchase</p>
<p>The City General Labor Union issued General Order No. 12 yesterday, stating: For the purpose of notification, since the government issued national salvation bonds, the subscription has reached more than half within just over a month due to the national people's rush to purchase. In addition to notifying various labor unions to instruct their affiliated workers to actively subscribe, in order to express the determination of long-term resistance, it has been specifically resolved that all employed workers in the city will contribute at least one day's wage per month to purchase national salvation bonds in order to increase the strength of resistance against the enemy. In addition to the distribution, this order is specifically notified to the labor union to instruct the affiliated employed workers to comply with it without fail. This order.</p>
<p>Women's Group Letter to Housewives</p>
<p>The Women's Group of the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee's purpose in soliciting national salvation bonds this time is not in material things but in spirit, so that every housewife understands the essentials of national salvation bonds and educates her children. A total of 80,000 copies of letters have been printed and distributed to households. The method is very good. It is reported that the letters will be issued starting today.</p>
<p>Business Community General Team Raised 70,000 Yesterday</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bond Business Community Solicitation General Team raised the debt funds of the New Medicine Industry, Chinese Soap Industry, Tobacco Industry, Foreign Firm Chinese Staff Team, Glass Industry, National Goods Rubber Products Industry, Hardware Parts Industry, Cowhide Grass Goods Industry, Leather Goods Industry, Silk Cocoon Industry, Stone Powder Company, etc., totaling 70,000, 1,381 yuan, and 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Yarn Exchange Brokers Subscribed 20,000</p>
<p>The Brokers Association of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange continued to subscribe to national salvation bonds, including 1,280 yuan from Xinxing Company, 900 yuan from Daji, 1,600 yuan from Xinhua, 1,000 yuan from Tongfu, 2,400 yuan from Hengde, 1,900 yuan from Hexing, 1,000 yuan from Hengyi, 2,400 yuan from Tongxing, 1,600 yuan from Xiecheng, 2,400 yuan from Shenji, 4,000 yuan from Ruida, and 2,880 yuan from Runkang, totaling 24,380 yuan. Together with the previous subscriptions, the total is 76,470 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Medicine Industry Raised Second Batch</h3>
<p>The National Salvation Bonds underwritten by the New Medicine Association have now raised the second batch of 10,000 yuan from Huamei, 4,000 yuan from Sino-British, 3,000 yuan from Sino-French, 2,000 yuan from Xin Asia, 1,000 yuan from Taihe, 500 yuan each from Zhengwei, Jicheng, Dazhong, Xinxing, and Zhenye, 200 yuan from Shihua, and 100 yuan from Dasheng. They have been remitted and are still being solicited with a target of 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sewing Industry Sub-Team Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sewing Machine Industry Association established a national salvation bond solicitation sub-team in the industry to facilitate solicitation. It is also heard that the industry will gather hundreds of sewing machines for military supplies, set a low price for sale, and purchase national salvation bonds with all the proceeds. If they cannot be sold completely, because the machines are directly applied products, they will also be sent to the Solicitation General Association as a guide for material payment of debt.</p>
<h3>International Relief Society Trial Run Refugee Workshop</h3>
<p>Daily wage of 15 yuan to maintain the livelihood of refugees</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Society has taken in a large number of refugees. In addition to sending them back to their hometowns one after another, it is still taking in more than 7,500 people, most of whom are homeless people from the Ta Jiabao area. It is reported that a Western member of the association suggested at the regular meeting that it is not appropriate for refugees to have no work to do all day long. After repeated careful study, they deeply felt that if this continued, not only would supplies be difficult, but it would also easily foster refugee laziness. Moreover, daily expenses were high, and it was difficult to maintain. The regular meeting decided to start a handicraft workshop first, select 1,000 refugees in the shelter, and train them. It is heard that they will be able to start production in two weeks, and each refugee will be given a monthly wage of 15 yuan so that the refugees can be independent and maintain their livelihoods. However, various expenses such as opening equipment require funds. The association is unable to hold it due to insufficient funds. It has been negotiated with the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Benevolent Relief Association, which has expressed sympathy. If there are results after the start of work, it will be expanded.</p>
<h3>Water Company Stipulates Water Quantity for Refugees</h3>
<p>Three Gallons per Day</p>
<p>The Shanghai Water Company believes that the amount of water used by refugees in refugee shelters exceeds the company's regulations. According to the agreement, free water is supplied, and the amount is limited to three gallons per person per day. However, as of September 30, the shelters have used approximately 7 million gallons. The company's promised 10 million gallons will be used up around the 15th of this month. The amount used per person per day has exceeded 18 gallons. The company has written to the Public Works Department Health Department to find ways to help, so that refugees will not use too much water, or explain the standards for free supply to the heads of the shelters. Mr. Hordern, Deputy Director of the Bureau, has notified the refugee agencies of the shelters to check.</p>
<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Proper Understanding of the Threat from the Sky</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Foreign newspapers have long said it. The barbarity and cruelty of the enemy. It is even worse than the "Mangyuan" race. In our country. Now, except for a few provinces in the west. Can there still be a peaceful paradise. Able to avoid the threat of enemy planes.</p>
<p>Of course. The inhumane bombing of enemy planes everywhere. It can only increase our hatred of the enemy. It will not have a decisive effect on the war. However, our compatriots in various places must also have several correct understandings under this threat.</p>
<p>First. We must know. The air force of any modern country cannot absolutely control the sky. And the task of the air force is only to attack the enemy army and defend military areas and major cities. The enemy now disregards justice and humanity. Invade our undefended peaceful area. Indiscriminate bombing. This shameful act is only a sign of decline.</p>
<p>Second. The air force is still only in an auxiliary position in modern military equipment. Because the air force cannot stay in the sky for a long time. Occupy land. (The Soviet Air Force is an exception) And the meaning of air combat is limited to mutual consumption. In terms of this meaning, the performance of our air force has been very outstanding.</p>
<p>Third. In the current three-dimensional war. It can be said that there is no distinction between the front and rear of our national territory. People from all over the country should use the spirit of cooperation at any time. Devote yourself to air defense facilities. In the event of an enemy air raid. It is especially necessary to maintain calmness. To maintain local order.</p>
<p>These points of understanding are the psychological conditions that compatriots in various places must have during wartime.</p>

<h3>Enemy Plane Bombing North Railway Station Endangers Safety of British Defenders</h3>
<p>British Military Authorities Protest, Enemy Naval Commander Sends Representatives to Apologize</p>
<p>The Times in this city reports that Japanese planes dropped bombs and bombarded the vicinity of the North Railway Station and Maigen Road on the morning of the 13th, causing stray bullets to fly in the Public Concession. Heavy pieces of iron fell in the central district and Old Gate district of the Public Concession, fortunately without injuring anyone. On the morning of the 13th, a bomb exploded on the boundary road. The British Royal Ulster Rifles were defending facing the railway station in the western Hongkou district. The sandbags piled up there were only fifteen yards away from the explosion site. The roof covering the stacked firearms was collapsed by the shock. Therefore, the British soldiers defending there temporarily withdrew. The British military authorities immediately protested to Hasegawa, commander of the Third Fleet of Japan, who sent representatives to apologize to the British and said that the bomb had fallen in Zhabei. However, Japanese planes continued to bomb indiscriminately afterward, but no stray bullets fell near the British troops.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that when Japanese planes attempted to bomb the North Railway Station on Wednesday and dropped bombs on the boundary road, British soldiers retreated to a safer place on Avenue Edward VII. The soldiers of the Fifth Defense Post on North Shanxi Road temporarily moved to the Sixth Defense Post, and the soldiers of the Eighth Defense Post on Kelonghai Road temporarily moved to the Seventh Defense Post. This move by the British soldiers was completely forced by the situation, similar to the situation where the American sailors on Yichang Road and West Suzhou Road temporarily moved a week ago. From 10:00 to 11:00 yesterday morning, three Japanese planes began to bomb the North Railway Station, dropping about fifteen to twenty bombs on the boundary road between the railway bureau and a Chinese hostel where British soldiers were stationed. The glass in the room where the British soldiers were stationed was shattered, and lime fell. Because the movement at that time was more dangerous, they lay still until the bombing stopped. Then the captain of the British soldiers in the area ordered the soldiers to temporarily retreat. After the British military officer contacted the Japanese military officer, the Japanese military officer said that there would be bombing in the afternoon and they should not return to their original posts. Therefore, the British soldiers returned to the boundary road to stand guard until the danger of bombing had passed at night.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Xujiahui Station in Formation</h3>
<p>More than Ten Bombs Dropped, Destroying Vehicles and Tracks, American Merchants' Residences Also Affected, Many Killed and Injured</p>
<p>At 3:15 p.m. yesterday, fourteen or five enemy planes flew to bomb Xujiahui Station, south of Hongqiao Road. There were many empty passenger cars parked south and north of the station. The enemy planes took the station and vehicles as targets and took turns dropping more than ten bombs. Four empty cars on the railway north of the station were destroyed, and the tracks were slightly damaged. The station is close to the 50 to 60 American-style houses in the Mei Hua New Village built by the American Merchant Real Estate Company, which were also affected. The residences of the American Weber and the German manager of the Chan Chen Yanghang Machinery Department were the most severely damaged. Seven people were killed and more than ten injured at the time of the bombing. More than ten houses near the railway were also bombed and destroyed. The station was unharmed. In addition to the more than 20 people killed and injured in Mei Hua New Village, the other casualties are being investigated.</p>
<h3>Many People Tragically Died in Shanghai West Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>Lanjialong, No. 1 Bridge, South of Hongqiao Road, Southwest of Xujiahui Station, is a village. Because pigs, vegetables, chickens, ducks, eggs, and other boats from Songjiang and Qingpu areas are mostly anchored here, peddlers go to wholesale purchases every day at noon, which is quite lively. At about 1 p.m. yesterday, three enemy planes circled over the area and threw seven or eight bombs into the crowd, and fired machine guns wildly. More than a dozen pig dealers (including four or five children) were killed on the spot, and about a dozen were injured. Two pig boats were sunk, and more than a dozen pigs were killed. On Zhongshan Road, one person was electrocuted and burned to death. After receiving the news, the reporter drove to the scene and saw that the bodies of all sizes were mixed in a section from Dashi Garden to the riverside, with broken limbs and legs, and a blurred mess of blood and flesh. The wounded were sitting on the ground and moaning sadly beside the road, which was unbearable to see. The Caohongjing Huangjia Garden fire engine and the city's defense regiment went to rescue and were sent to Zhongshan Hospital and Yongchuan Hospital in Baxianqiao for treatment. At about 3 p.m., six enemy heavy bombers flew to make a second bombing, dropping about ten bombs, and more than 20 civilians were killed and injured again. The planes circled and flew low, firing machine guns randomly. Many houses along the way were damaged by bullets. The Xinhua Film Company on Tushan Bay Xietu Road was also hit by a bullet, and the losses were heavy.</p>
<p>New Land Teachers College Bombed Three Times</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pudong Municipal New Land Teachers College was also bombed and destroyed by enemy planes a few days ago. The school is the only teacher training institution in the city and has made great contributions to Shanghai education over the years. On September 13, the enemy dropped two heavy bombs on the school, destroying the back door, kitchen, toilet, bathroom, dining hall, and student dormitory. On the previous two days (12th and 13th), enemy planes flew over the school again and dropped more than ten bombs. All the classrooms, auditoriums, offices, teachers' bedrooms, and workshops of the normal department were completely destroyed, and the losses were extremely heavy.</p>
<h3>Pudong Villages Suffer Calamity Together</h3>
<p>Although the enemy occasionally shelled the Pudong area, their attacks were without specific targets, causing no major damage. Generally, the residents had become accustomed to it and did not find it unusual. However, on the 13th of this month, enemy aircraft not only indiscriminately dropped bombs and strafed with machine guns in the market towns of Jinjiaqiao, Gaohang, Zhangjiaqiao, and Luhang, but also frequently wreaked havoc in nearby villages such as Choujiazhai, Minjiazhai, and Jiangjia, resulting in no fewer than fifty or sixty injured civilians. Some had their limbs blown off and died before receiving medical treatment. Consequently, most of the local civilians fled, and shops in the towns temporarily closed their doors, creating a very bleak situation.</p>
<h3>Villagers in Old Longhua Town Killed by Bombing</h3>
<p>Three large enemy aircraft circled over the Nanshi area at nine o'clock yesterday morning, flying low over the South Railway Station for reconnaissance and strafing with machine guns for five minutes. Fortunately, there were no passengers at the South Railway Station at that time, so no one was injured. Subsequently, the enemy aircraft flew to the Gaochangmiao and Xieqiao areas, dropping absurd leaflets filled with seductive words, but the public tore them up without a second glance. According to another report, six enemy aircraft circled back and forth over the Gaochangmiao, Railway Station, and Jinyilu areas of Nanshi from 5:30 a.m. on the 14th. At noon, they flew to Old Longhua Town and dropped six bombs, destroying several houses and killing or wounding several innocent villagers. Until 3:00 p.m., they continued to observe back and forth.</p>
<h3>The Cili Lianhe Jiuzai Hui (Charity United Disaster Relief Association) Sends Telegrams to Console the Four Ambassadors Gu, Guo, Qian, and Wang</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association deeply admired Gu Jun, Guo Taiqi, Qian Tai, and Wang Zhengting, the four ambassadors representing our country at the League of Nations General Assembly, for their efforts in Geneva and Washington to persuade the member states of the League of Nations and the United States to express their deep sympathy for our country. It sent letters of condolence to each of them. The original telegram read: (Titles omitted) "This time, the powerful neighbor invaded, attempting to seize Pingjin and attacking Songhu, and indiscriminately bombing our innocent civilians and cultural institutions. Their behavior, which violates public morality and is inhumane, has long been condemned by China and foreign countries alike. Your Excellency upholds justice, negotiating and mediating, causing European and American countries to express sympathy and impose sanctions. The effectiveness of the transition depends entirely on your devoted efforts. Although we seek no assistance from others in legitimate self-defense, it is an unchanging principle, ancient and modern, that those who have the Tao (righteousness) receive much help. We hope that you will continue to elucidate based on legal treaties, so that the enemy's atrocities can be publicized to the world, and with public opinion on our side, we will surely achieve final victory. We deeply admire and look up to you. Since the outbreak of the war, our association has been handling relief work and has now established more than fifty refugee shelters. In addition to sending refugees away, we provide long-term care for around 40,000 people. We have also established four wounded soldier hospitals, and the expenses for food, clothing, and medicine are enormous. We are running out of rice to cook and are extremely anxious. We are sending this message as an attachment and hope for your consideration."</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Veteran Cao Yabo Passes Away</h3>
<p>Cao Yabo, a native of Xingguo, Hubei, was a classmate of the martyr Huang Keqiang in his youth. He often promoted racial revolution in the Lianghu Academy and was recognized by the late Premier, joining the Xingzhonghui and Tongmenghui as a powerful member. His footprints spanned the globe, and he was proficient in various languages, so people from China and abroad enjoyed associating with him. From the Liuyang Uprising to the successful Xinhai Revolution, he participated in every endeavor. However, after achieving success, he retired and lived a simple life. After the death of the late Premier, he retreated to Kunshan, practiced vegetarianism, and studied Buddhist scriptures extensively. Now, upon hearing of his sudden passing, everyone, whether they knew him or not, mourns him deeply. Cao was sixty-three years old and wrote "The True History of the Wuchang Revolution," which has been passed down to posterity.</p>
<h3>Former Commercial Press Workers Organize Anti-Enemy Support Association</h3>
<p>Since the violent Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the workers of the Commercial Press have been the first to bear the brunt. They all feel filled with righteous indignation and have never lagged behind in resisting the enemy and saving the country. Therefore, they have specially contacted former colleagues of the press to organize an anti-enemy support association. It is reported that the association is conducting registration and training at No. 54 Hengmaoli, Baxianqiao, in order to concentrate anti-enemy forces.</p>
<h3>Cilian Hui Shelter Closes</h3>
<p>Refugees Move to Daivisuo Shelter</p>
<p>The Central Shelter of the Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association, which has been using the Central Grand Theatre since the August 13th Incident, has been in operation for two months. Now, in view of the fact that the theater is scheduled to reopen soon in order to maintain the livelihoods of its employees, the association relocated all the refugees in the shelter to the "Refugee Waiting Shelter" behind the Yangtze Hotel yesterday in order to help merchants in difficulty.</p>
<h3>Diary of a Military Correspondent (7)</h3>
<p>— Special Military Correspondent Chen Wanli of the Central News Agency</p>
<p>October 13th</p>
<p>Yesterday's bloody battle on the south bank of the Wusong River was truly beyond Matsui's expectations. Not only did it not diminish our "resistance," but it also broke the enemy's own "attack power." After yesterday's battle between the main forces of the enemy and ourselves, the enemy has lost the ability to attack. Today, they are lying low in their trenches and dare not launch an attack. As for us, today we are taking advantage of our victory to attack the enemy who crossed the river to the Jiangjiazhai area in front of the mountain, capturing many light machine guns, rifles, and other spoils of war.</p>
<p>Since the enemy has suffered a major blow on land, they have dispatched large numbers of aircraft to bomb everywhere today. The heavy explosions and crisp machine gun fire are interspersed with the grand sound of anti-aircraft guns. There is simply no moment of tranquility all day long. This is probably considered revenge by the enemy. However, for us, other than a few more bomb shelters in the fields, nothing has been damaged.</p>
<p>Spoils of war are being sent from all fronts in a steady stream. Today, I saw the diary of a lower-ranking enemy officer. In it, the procedures for mobilization and preparations before departure are recorded in great detail. The enemy's fear of our air force is also shown in various actions. Now, I will excerpt and translate this diary of the enemy who died in battle. The original is very concise and beautiful, but I cannot preserve it.</p>

<p>▲ September 15th Today is the date of the Kanto air defense exercise. The air defense shooting unit held an exercise at 8:00 a.m., and a sentry exercise was held again at 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>▲ September 16th Received orders to depart this morning. Then, attended the farewell party of friends like 榊原 and drank heavily until almost drunk.</p>
<p>▲ September 17th Woke up at 5:00 a.m. After roll call, pay was issued and military photos were taken. An inspection of weapons and gas masks was held at 10:00 a.m., and the squad was also formed. Paid respects to the Imperial Palace at 3:00 p.m. and could not move freely. Went to Ginza for a stroll and returned to the team in the evening. Practiced night attack at 9:00 p.m. and returned to accommodation at 10:30 p.m.</p>
<p>▲ September 18th Woke up at 5:00 a.m. The autumn air was clear, and the dew was unusually heavy. Arrived at the team at 1:00 p.m. and departed for Shibuya Station at 2:00 p.m. Said goodbye to relatives and friends. At 5:54 p.m., amid cheers, sang the Kimigayo song and left Tokyo by train.</p>
<p>▲ September 19th Arrived at Kobe and disembarked at 11:30 a.m. Assembled the squad in the Kobe Kindergarten.</p>
<p>▲ September 20th Formed up at 7:30 a.m. and boarded the ship in succession. At this time, the flags of the Rising Sun fluttered at the pier, and thoughts of the motherland swirled in my chest. Started anchoring at around 4:00 p.m., and I don't know who to tell my departing feelings to. I am on the No. 135 transport ship, Fukumaru. There are also six other transport ships. Departed from Moji on the same day.</p>

Passed through the Kanmon Strait at 6:00 p.m., and the 1st platoon of the 8th Company was dispatched to serve as an anti-aircraft watch post.</p>
<p>▲ September 22nd Held another air defense exercise today. There are a total of eight transport ships traveling together on the sea. Submarines protect the left and right sides from afar. Important orders were issued at night, announcing the landing locations of each unit.</p>
<p>▲ September 23rd In the morning, the commander unfolded the map and indicated the enemy's positions and the current battle situation. I learned that the main force of the enemy is near D场 (Dachang), and the date of our army's general attack is approaching, and we have decided to adopt a breakthrough strategy. Then, two destroyers protected the entrance, and the anti-aircraft shooting team was also on strict alert. We will land between Wusong and Shanghai. My heart is very uneasy. When will I be able to see Tokyo again? Can I return alive?"</p>
<p>The diary ends with the landing on the 23rd. The rest is blank. I guess he was shot by a ruthless bullet after landing and became one of the sacrifices in the fourth general offensive. In his diary, he wrote the names of the people he met every day. Besides his parents often visiting him, there was also a woman named "Akiko." From September 8th to 18th, she went to see him every day without exception, except for the 11th and 15th, because he departed early in the morning on the 11th for inspection and did not return to the team until the evening, and the 15th was the date of the Kanto air defense exercise, and she was hindered by traffic. This woman named "Akiko," I don't know if she is his wife or lover, but even now, perhaps she is still in a corner of Tokyo, her eyes filled with tears, looking at the distant autumn sky, praying for her husband or lover to return soon.</p>

<h3>After Great Victory in Zhabei, Our Troops Triumphantly Return to Original Positions This Morning</h3>
<p>Testing Enemy Strength and Achieving Containment Objectives; Our Army's Counter-Offensive on South Bank of Wusong River Progresses; Enemy's Attempt to Cross River at Xinluzhai Thwarted</p>
<p>Our army launched a full-scale counter-offensive yesterday. In the Zhabei area, our troops launched fierce attacks on enemy positions from Dongbaoxing Road, Qiujiang Road, Guangdong Street, Zhongzhou Road, Bazibridge, and other locations. They were led by tanks and other mechanized units and first bombarded with fierce artillery fire. The enemy was caught off guard and hastily fought back. Our loyal and brave soldiers charged into battle, sweeping aside those who stood in their way and killing the enemy like cutting hemp. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy abandoned their positions and retreated in disarray. Our army successfully controlled the area north of Beisichuan Road and Laobazilu, south of Yokohama Road, and west of Changchun Road. In this battle, the enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties and damage, and their defensive fortifications were completely destroyed. Our army's original purpose was to test the enemy's strength, deplete their ammunition and supplies, and pose a considerable threat. After completing its mission last night, it triumphantly retreated to its original defensive line this morning. After this defeat, the enemy has lost morale. Zhabei and Jiangwan were relatively quiet this morning. On the south bank of the Wusong River, the enemy repeatedly attempted to make trouble but was repelled by our army. Our three-pronged advance forced the remnants of the enemy to retreat to the riverbank, hiding in their trenches and in a very sorry state. They can be completely cleared out within days. The enemy spokesperson has repeatedly made wild remarks, but has not publicized a single word about military progress in recent days, only saying that all preparations are in place and waiting for the opportunity to launch a general offensive, which proves that our army's consecutive great victories are ironclad facts.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that our agency's military correspondent in Zhabei reported at 12:00 noon on the 15th that our army's counter-offensive towards Beisichuan Road last night was quite successful and achieved its predetermined objectives. The troops then withdrew, but the middle section of that road is completely under our control. However, the enemy was particularly unwilling to have their positions breached by us, so after reinforcements arrived, they launched a counter-offensive from the street corners of the eastern section of the road at 4:30 a.m. The two sides fought in street battles for three hours, but the enemy did not advance an inch, and our army still controlled the new positions. According to military news, after 6:00 p.m. last night, our army launched attacks in separate directions in the Zhabei, Baoshan Road, Tiantong'an, and Bazibridge areas. The purpose was to test the enemy's strength. After our army forced back the enemy's outposts, we advanced into the enemy's first line of defense. The enemy hastily fought back and was in a state of chaos. After a while, since we had achieved our purpose, we all withdrew to our original lines. The enemy suffered many casualties in this battle.</p>
<h3>Our Zhabei Offensive Reports Victory</h3>
<p>Our Artillery Units Everywhere Launch Fierce Offensive; Enemy Abandons Weapons in Panic and Flees, Leaving Corpses Everywhere</p>
<p>On the Zhabei line of our army's right wing, in view of the fact that the enemy has been pouring all its efforts into fiercely attacking across the Wusong River in recent days, in an attempt to fulfill its dream of breaking through in the center, our army has relied on its ability to act in advance and has made strict defenses, finally defeating the enemy's main force and resolving the danger at Dachang. However, there are still a large number of enemies crossing the river, and although they are now trapped along the riverbank, their ambitions have not diminished, so the fighting in that area is still continuing fiercely. Therefore, in order to contain the strength of the enemy's central force and to make the enemy exhausted from running around, our army suddenly launched a fierce offensive against the enemy on the entire line last night, while our large air force and artillery units from all over the area were exerting their power. Armored vehicles were used as the vanguard, and the momentum was great. The enemy was swept aside by the wind, and the area from Baoshan Road and Tiantong'an Road to Bazibridge was particularly fierce. By about 8:00 p.m., the north and south ends of Beisichuan Road had been controlled by our army. At the same time, the area north of Laobazilu, south of Yokohama Road, and west of Changchun Road was also completely under the heavy pressure of our army. The enemy abandoned their weapons in panic and fled, leaving corpses everywhere. Our army achieved its objective and triumphantly returned to defend its original positions. The enemy, who had been lurking in the Sixty-Three Garden, suddenly attacked our Bazibridge, but was eventually flanked by our two-pronged attack and routed. The enemy suffered more than fifty casualties.</p>
<h3>Our Army's Fierce Offensive on the South Bank of the Wusong River Yields Fruitful Results</h3>
<p>Our Troops on All Roads, Including Dashiqiao, Zhao Jiajiao, and Chenjiaxiang, Are Making Rapid Progress</p>
<p>Yesterday's battle on the south bank of the Wusong River was still very fierce. The remaining enemy stubbornly resisted under the cover of artillery and aircraft. Our army's three-pronged counter-offensive was very successful. One of our units advanced from the Dashiqiao area and thrust northwest. Under the fierce pressure of our army, the enemy hastily fought back and retreated after suffering casualties all over the ground. At the same time, one of our units conducted an encirclement of the enemy's left wing at Zhao Jiajiao. The fierce fighting was quite intense. The enemy could not attend to everything at once and had difficulty coping. Our army then advanced forward and annihilated countless stubborn enemies who resisted. In other areas, the advance of our army in Chenjiaxiang and Dongdunsi was also quite smooth, and it progressed rapidly eastward. After our fierce offensive, the enemy was in a terrible state and in extreme disarray.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Makes Meritorious Service in Night Raid</h3>
<p>Enemy Airfield and Ammunition Depot Hit by Bombs and Caught Fire; Enemy Corpses Scattered Near Jiaxing Road Bridge</p>
<p>From 6:00 p.m. last night to 6:00 a.m. this morning, within these twelve hours, our air force launched eleven night raids on the Hongkou area on the front line in Shanghai. The enemy suffered heavy losses. According to military news, the enemy airfield in Yangshupu was hit by bombs and caught fire, destroying seven enemy aircraft. The two attacks after 5:15 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. this morning were particularly fruitful and established meritorious service. The enemy's Osaka Wharf ammunition depot and Shanghai Yarn Factory barracks were both bombed and destroyed. More than 300 enemy soldiers were killed, it is said.</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, the headquarters of the enemy's naval landing force on Beisichuan Road and Jiangwan Road was again severely damaged by our valiant air force this morning. Two bombs were reportedly dropped, destroying a corner of the roof, and the water pipes set up at the foot of the wall along Huanglulu Road were also damaged and broken. However, the enemy had three sets of water pipes, so the water supply was not cut off immediately, and workers have already been hired to repair them. This also proves that our army's bombs did not fall in vain.</p>
<p>At about 7:15 a.m. this morning, there were many stray bullets in the thatched sheds near the Jiaxing Road Bridge on Dixiwei Road in Hongkou. The thatched sheds immediately caught fire and could not be extinguished. The fire brigade drove to the scene to rescue the fire, which was extinguished after three hours. It is estimated that more than forty thatched sheds were burned down, and enemy corpses were found everywhere, which shows how fierce the fighting was last night.</p>
<h3>We Valiantly Recapture Guo Cai's Residence</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that our agency's military correspondent in Jiangwan reported at 10:25 a.m. on the 15th that Guo Cai's Residence, about three kilometers east of Miaoxing, is only 300 meters away from our Majiazhai stronghold. The two sides are facing each other. The enemy attempted to invade yesterday afternoon but was repelled by us. Before dawn today, our army carried out a night raid, launching an attack from Majiazhai and charging valiantly, destroying their alert line and penetrating deep into the enemy's positions. The enemy responded hastily, but before they could make a few moves, they suffered heavy casualties and collapsed. Our army then swept away the enemy and recaptured Guo Cai's Residence.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Landing at Baimao Estuary Fails</h3>
<p>Enemy Ships Fire 500 Shells Continuously; Three Attempts to Land by Motorboats Are Repulsed</p>
<p>Many enemy ships are stationed on the Baimao Estuary river surface, waiting for an opportunity to move. Fortunately, our river defense is very solid, leaving no room for them to maneuver. Yesterday morning, another enemy warship was added outside the Baimao Estuary. Starting at 7:00 a.m., the ships lined up in a row and bombarded our positions along the river, firing more than 500 shells in a row for about two hours. Apart from the destruction of some village houses, our side suffered no significant damage to its positions. When the artillery fire was at its most intense, several motorboats carrying the enemy attempted to land from the ships, a total of three times. They were all repelled by our army, and many were killed or wounded. Their landing plan was again thwarted. Knowing that they could not succeed, the enemy ceased their shelling after 9:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attacks Guangfu Town and Attempts to Cross River at Xinluzhai but is Repulsed</h3>
<p>Company Commander Killed on the Spot by Us; Our Army's Defensive Line Remains Exceptionally Solid</p>
<p>The enemy at Liuhang has repeatedly attacked our Guangfu Town. After being severely defeated by our army, they once retreated to the Dijing and highway areas. The enemy's ambition has not died, and they continue to attack again and again, but they have all been met head-on and repelled by our army's heroic soldiers. After the enemy's frontal attack failed, they changed their strategy and harassed us from the sides on the north and south routes. Fierce fighting occurred in the Mengjiazhai, Laoluzhai, Chenjiazhai, and Zhoujiazhai areas north and south of Guangfu, but the enemy was never successful. Thereupon, the enemy attempted to cross the Yangjing River at Guangfu in order to attack our army's rear, but our army was heavily guarded and could not fly across. Yesterday, an enemy company of about 500 or 600 men attempted to cross the river near Xinluzhai but was discovered by our army. Even under the joint cover of enemy aircraft and artillery, our army still moved forward and repelled them. Nearly a hundred of them were swept away by our army's machine guns. The enemy's 36th Regiment company commander, Captain Hayashi, was also killed on the spot, and his body has been recovered. Three enemy prisoners were captured alive, and an enemy order was found, which ordered the company to break through the Guangfu line within three days from the 10th to the 12th. The enemy's attempt failed again after this severe defeat, while our army's defensive line remains exceptionally solid and cannot be shaken in the slightest.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report from our agency's military correspondent in Guangfu at 9:45 a.m. on the 15th stated that starting at 2:00 a.m. this morning, enemy artillery again bombarded our positions in the Zhubeizhai and Sunjiazhai areas for two hours. At dawn, about two battalions of enemy soldiers, carrying a large amount of river-crossing equipment, attempted to cross the river but were intercepted by us, killing many enemy soldiers. Fighting was still raging when the report was filed.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Attack on Shi Xianggong Temple Repulsed</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that our agency's military correspondent in Guangfu reported at 9:50 a.m. on the 15th that from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon, enemy artillery fired at our positions in the Shi Xianggong Temple area for about two hours. The firing stopped after our artillery returned fire and suppressed them. At 3:00 a.m. this morning, the sound of artillery fire started again, and about 300 enemy infantrymen advanced towards the right flank of our army's positions at Shi Xianggong Temple under its cover. Our army bravely fought back, and the enemy never succeeded. After dawn, the bodies of the enemy were piled up, abandoned in our positions, which shows the severity of the damage suffered by the enemy, it is said.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullets Flew Across the Special Zone Last Night</h3>
<p>Last night, many stray bullets fell in the Special Zone. The investigation is as follows: At 5:55 p.m., a shell hit the detective section of the Laozha Public Concession Police Station, causing considerable damage.

A shell fell on North Henan Road, killing six Chinese and injuring one. A shell exploded on North Fujian Road, killing one and injuring ten. A shell fell on North Shanxi Road, killing and injuring two each.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Zhabei and Pudong</h3>
<p>From this morning until noon, the buzzing of enemy planes over our city was less intense than yesterday. This is likely because the enemy planes were severely damaged in yesterday's attack by our planes, so they did not dare to venture out in large numbers. However, around 8:30 this morning, six enemy heavy bombers flew over Zhabei. Our stationed troops immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, causing the enemy planes to fly high. They randomly dropped fifteen heavy bombs in the area north of Yongxing Road and Baoshan Road, north of Qiujiang Road, and south of the Commercial Press. Besides destroying several civilian houses, there were no other losses. Afterwards, enemy planes disappeared. Furthermore, around 9:00 this morning, over twenty enemy planes took off from the eastern district and flew over. Twenty minutes later, over ten more planes were seen following them. They then flew west, seemingly heading towards the Beijing-Shanghai defense line to wreak havoc. At 11:45, three enemy heavy bombers reappeared over Zhabei, circling in the sky. The sound of our anti-aircraft machine guns firing could be heard, and the enemy planes had no chance to descend and drop bombs. After a while, they dejectedly left.</p>
<p>Three enemy planes took off at 9:00 this morning and indiscriminately bombed the Yangjiadu, Dongjiadu, and Xinmalu areas of Pudong. Around 10:00, three more giant planes flew over and heavily bombed the southern Huangpu and its Changzhan and Shenjialong areas of Pudong. For almost half a day, they exerted all their efforts in indiscriminate bombing, but because the enemy planes had no target, our side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces to Greatly Reinforce Again</h3>
<p>Our East China News Agency reporter recently received a reliable report that the enemy is now greatly reinforcing Shanghai, planning for a fifth general offensive. The reinforcements that can be confirmed are two brigades of the Third Division, one brigade belonging to the Sixth Division, and the remnants of the Fifteenth Division that have already arrived in Shanghai, totaling one brigade. These reinforcements are currently gathering in Dalian and Taiwan, boarding ships, and are expected to arrive in Shanghai before the 20th of this month. It is also learned that the enemy will launch a fifth general offensive after the reinforcements arrive, dreaming of a swift end to the Shanghai battle. Therefore, it is anticipated that a major battle will soon unfold on the Zhabei defense line.</p>
<h3>No. 16 Trolleybus Line Operated as Usual This Morning</h3>

<h3>Nanjing Wounded Soldier Hospital Is Busy</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] A small number of doctors and nurses at the local wounded soldier hospitals are working day and night to care for the wounded soldiers, putting in great effort. However, there are a large number of wounded soldiers, making it difficult to cope. The temporary hospital at National Central University, for example, has only four official doctors and twenty-four nurses, while caring for 750 patients. Two hundred more wounded soldiers are expected to arrive successively tomorrow. Dr. Eidinger, who returned to China from Vienna just four weeks ago, is currently in charge of the hospital. Yesterday, he personally performed surgery as many as twenty-six times, working through the night and only sleeping for two and a half hours this morning before resuming his duties immediately. Two hundred wounded soldiers arrived last night and could not be treated at the time. However, their condition suggests that sufficient medical personnel are providing first aid behind the front lines. Doctors in the capital are currently working extremely hard, so the authorities are urging medical professionals to come forward and assist. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Students Returning from Japan Go to the Capital for Training</h3>

Those who heard of it were moved, and all three armies were inspired by the sight.</p>
<h3>International Federation of Trade Unions Responds to Our Seamen's Union</h3>
<p>And Attaches a Declaration Against Japanese Aggression Against China</p>
<p>The office of the Special Commissioner of the Chinese Seamen's Union previously sent a telegram to the World International Federation of Trade Unions denouncing all the atrocities committed by the enemy army in China, requesting it to forward this information to trade unions in all countries to uphold justice and urge governments to take effective measures to impose strict sanctions on the empire of Japan, which is bound to invade. It has been learned that the Union received a reply telegram from the International Federation of Trade Unions yesterday, along with a declaration issued by the Federation in Paris on September 8 denouncing the Japanese invasion of China. The wording expresses extreme indignation. The translation of the declaration is excerpted below: The International Federation of Trade Unions' Declaration on the Japanese Invasion of China: China, the oldest and most extensive country in the world, possessing 400 million excellent people and a long history, has gradually completed its new Chinese stage in recent years with progress in construction. However, the Japanese imperialists, in order to realize their aggressive ambitions, have constantly obstructed the development of China in order to achieve their destructive purposes. China, constantly threatened by violence, has no choice but to rise up and resist in order to shatter the delusions of aggression and bring peace to the world. This Federation, in light of the undying ambitions of Japanese imperialism and deeply sympathizing with the suffering of the Chinese people from Japanese brutality, is determined to unite all workers worldwide in the cause of human justice to impose sanctions on Japan. Now, in addition to the National Labor Consultative Council, the highest labor body in the United Kingdom, having fulfilled its obligations, this Federation will demand that all signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty of 1932 jointly guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of China, and simultaneously urge all countries, especially the United States, to recognize the League of Nations' power to prevent war. If international law for maintaining world peace is violated by violence, then all other peace-loving countries will inevitably feel threatened. Therefore, at this moment, we should all rise up together, decide on effective measures, and strive to achieve the goal of stopping the war. This Federation will appeal to the world to uphold justice with conscience and explain the future crisis of the world. If various countries wish to avoid such dangers, they must fully expose the imperialism and tyranny and sweep away such violent forces with an unyielding spirit. Otherwise, democratic countries will have their own methods to eliminate the desire for aggression. Now, in order to uphold the dignity of international law, governments should not remain inactive and should quickly adopt effective measures to ensure the independence of China and establish a lasting foundation for world peace.</p>
<h3>Random Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Every time our air force ventures out, the enemy is panic-stricken and embarrassed. Anti-aircraft guns and machine guns are fired aimlessly. But the cruel enemy drops bombs indiscriminately every day in our inland, undefended areas, showing their cruelty to the extreme. However, this kind of bombing cannot be considered completely worthless. Although not every bomb hits our people directly, every bomb hits the hearts of our people, stirring up various anti-Japanese sentiments. In other words, each additional bomb increases the strength of our people's determination to resist the enemy. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to use aircraft and bombs to threaten China into submission is absolutely impossible. Our occasional night air raids merely allow the enemy to taste the flavor of these aircraft and bombs.</p>

<h3>"How Should We Resist the Enemy and Save the Nation?"</h3>
<p>This is the title of a radio address by Liu Yucai, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the First Wartime Service Regiment of the Boy Scouts of China, broadcast on the Ministry of Transportation Radio Station. The text of the address is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, today our national enemy, the Japanese imperialists, are again using force to invade our Tianjin and slaughter our compatriots. Now, in Shanghai, Wusong River, and elsewhere, they are bombing us everywhere. We have truly reached the final juncture for the survival of our nation. I see and hear that many compatriots are filled with anger at the enemy's brutality and are considering how to fight for the survival of our nation. We see how loyally and bravely the troops fighting on the front lines are sacrificing their lives to resist the enemy's advance. Although the outcome of the war cannot yet be known, all of these actions have proven that we can resist the enemy and save the nation, and guarantee that we can achieve final victory! So today I am here to talk to you about the question of how we should resist the enemy and save the nation. Our government's attitude towards the enemy has been clearly and thoroughly proclaimed to the world several times by Chairman Chiang. Now that the Japanese imperialists are constantly invading us, we can only fight for the survival of our nation, and we can only resist the enemy by implementing Chairman Chiang's policies. Speaking of how to resist the enemy and save the nation, we can divide it into three points: First, we should know correctly how much power the enemy has. This question can be divided into three points. First point: Over the past six years, the enemy has constantly invaded our country. In particular, the recent attacks and bombings by the enemy in the areas of Pingjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Nanjing have finally shattered the dreams of a few people who thought that the Japanese imperialists' aggression had limits. On the other hand, these tragic facts inevitably arouse some compatriots to wrongly regard all Japanese people as enemies. We must know that it is Japanese imperialism that is invading China, and it is the brutal and tyrannical Japanese imperialist warlords. As for the Japanese people, I believe that most of them still love peace and uphold justice and righteousness. I believe that one day they will join hands with us to punish their rampant warlords and overthrow their imperialist politics. Recently, the people in Japan have risen up to oppose their warlord government's invasion of China. This is a powerful proof, but we must not have the slightest illusion about Japanese imperialism and warlords. They can only be destroyed under the iron and blood of our nation's revolutionary war, at which time they will be able to curb their insatiable ambitions and recognize the justice and righteousness of the world. Second: Some of us overestimate the enemy's strength and underestimate our own! The reason why they overestimate the enemy's strength is, on the one hand, because they overestimate the effectiveness of the enemy's artillery fire, and on the other hand, they believe that Japan can use despicable means of threats and inducements to buy many people in our country to become tools. Regarding the effectiveness of artillery fire in modern warfare, we will explain it in detail later. Now, taking the war in Shanghai as an example, this is an action that the enemy has been deliberately planning for at least a month. Why, after attacking for two weeks, with the enemy suffering casualties ranging from five hundred to three thousand, have they not yet captured our Shanghai? From this, it can be seen that as long as our generals and soldiers are loyal, patriotic, and unafraid of sacrifice, and have some preparation, they can resist the enemy's superior weapons and strike at the enemy's seemingly strong but weak actions. Similarly, our failure in the Pingjin war was due to the concentration and multitude of the enemy's forces, but also due to our own insufficient preparation; otherwise, the enemy would not have succeeded so easily. Third: On the other hand, some people underestimate the enemy's strength, thinking that as long as our army fights back, the enemy will be defeated and destroyed. This is also an unrealistic idea. Because national revolutionary warfare cannot rely solely on the quality of weapons, but we must at least have determination, planning, and preparation. We must avoid the enemy's strengths and attack their weaknesses, and use our strengths to attack their weaknesses. Because resisting the enemy is our unwavering determination throughout the country! It requires thorough and concrete planning, the most possible adequate preparation, and a sustained, large-scale war of resistance. Secondly, we should correctly understand the policy of resisting the enemy. We are now implementing the war of resistance entirely because our enemy forced it upon us. It is not that we do not love peace. It is precisely because we loved peace too much in the past that we became the target of Japanese imperialist aggression. Now, only by using the means of resistance can we achieve true peace and enable all ethnic groups in the world to gain the right to equal and free survival and development. Therefore, our resolute resistance is not to end our lives with death, preserving individual dignity and national dignity as satisfaction, but to seek the permanent survival of countless people of the whole nation through the sacrifice of a few people. We are not destroying our nation and national construction, so that even if the enemy occupies all of China, they will gain nothing. Instead, we will use our strong resistance to completely drive out the enemy from both the places not yet or already invaded by the enemy, and to achieve national freedom and equality! Our confidence in this final victory is not an illusion but a lesson. Therefore, the result of this Sino-Japanese war is that as long as we thoroughly resist, the loser will definitely be Japan, and the final winner will definitely be our country. From what has been said above, we have about three points on how to resist the enemy and save the nation: First, we must promote the spirit of national resistance in our country, like Ling Yin Ziwen, who destroyed his home to help the nation, acting for the public and not for private gain, and Shen Baoxu, who acted for the country and not for his family. We must first break many bad concepts, such as selfishness, dishonesty, fear of death, acting for the family but not for the country, and protecting oneself wisely. If these concepts are not completely eliminated, leaving no trace of a slave mentality, we should now replace "selfishness" with "public service," "dishonesty" with "loyalty," "fear of death" with "sacrifice," and "dying on the battlefield" with "dying in bed." If we all do only know the public and not the private, are loyal to the country and the nation, disregard the family, and sacrifice the lives of the small self to exchange for the survival of the national self, then our country will definitely be able to obtain a free and equal position from the oppression of Japanese imperialism. For example, the Turkish and Soviet wars of resistance are the best examples of gaining victory through the spirit of national resistance. Second, we must know that carrying out the war of resistance is a long-term, arduous, and huge task. In addition to contributing our bodies to the battlefield to fight, we should also contribute our money and property to the country to provide all the necessary war expenses. Recently, Zhang said that the aggressive Japan, their citizens have even donated one million yuan and five hundred thousand yuan to the country. We are the country that is being invaded, we are the people at the final juncture of life and death, so we should be even more enthusiastic than the enemy in destroying our families to help the nation and strive to buy national salvation bonds. Everyone should contribute a large portion of all the money they have to the country, then we will naturally not be afraid of financial difficulties, and we will not be afraid that we do not have new types of weapons to resist the enemy. Third, the war of resistance is undoubtedly a huge consuming war. Our people should redouble their efforts to save personal supplies for the war of resistance, implement not supplying raw materials to the enemy, and completely concentrate the items obtained from frugality and production in the hands of the country. In this way, our war of resistance can last for a long time, and the strength can be increased. Internally, there are many contradictions, and soldiers have the psychology of shrinking back, fearing death, and not wanting to fight. But it must also be under our long-term resistance and counterattack that their internal problems and contradictions can be fully exposed. In short, we must avoid the enemy's strengths and attack their weaknesses, and use our strengths to attack their weaknesses. Because resisting the enemy is our unwavering determination throughout the country! It requires thorough and concrete planning, the most possible adequate preparation, and a sustained, large-scale war of resistance. Estimating the enemy's strength too high or too low is a mistake. Estimating it too high will only lead to waiting to be a subjugated slave or willingly becoming a traitor. Estimating it too low will inevitably lead to many unnecessary failures and losses, which will only increase the enemy's ferocity. Therefore, our correct estimate of the enemy should be that the enemy's material strength is not terrible! We will definitely win! And the condition for this must-win is that the enemy has recently implemented the seventh conscription in their country and increased war expenses by 450 million yuan, and announced that 30 divisions will be used to attack our country. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, Japan used mobilized troops to scare Yuan Shikai, causing him to recognize most of the twenty-one demands he had proposed. Compatriots, now is not the era of that traitorous government. We must mobilize 450 million people to respond to their mobilization of 30 divisions. We must contribute our spirit, our money, and our resources to the war of resistance. , and we must be prepared to fight until the enemy is defeated. If not, there will be ruin. Sun Yat-sen taught us, "Annam had a high official who lived in Henan named Huang Qigao. Before Annam was subjugated, he had served as prime minister, so he had been promoted to high office and made a great fortune. Because he was very wealthy, he had a lot of property in Henan, and the garden in his home was very large. But now that Annam has been subjugated, even though he had been a high official and made a great fortune, he is still a slave of France. If a country is subjugated, one has to be a slave of foreigners. What glory is there for one who has been promoted like Huang Qigao and made a fortune like Huang Qigao, but people still think of him as a subjugated slave? The survival of a country has a great relationship with our people. If a country is strong, everyone will be honored. If a country is weak, everyone will be ashamed." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's this last word is also the advice I give to you today. I hope that all the people of the country will, under the unified leadership of the government, implement a strong and lasting national revolutionary war of resistance. The enemy is not to be feared, and small failures once or twice are not to be worried about. As long as all of us continue to resist, victory will definitely be ours.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on Enemy Aircraft Bombing in Guangdong</h3>
<p>From the 27th to the 30th, the Targets Were the Yuehan Railway and Humen</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Enemy aircraft have been continuously attacking Guangzhou from the 21st to the 26th of last month, as reported previously. On the 26th, enemy aircraft divided into three groups, totaling nine planes, took off from aircraft carriers in Tangjiawan to attack Humen and Huangpu. Special attention was given to the North River area, aiming to bomb bridges along the Yuehan Railway. Jiangcun, Dalang, Yinzhan'ao, and other key transportation areas along the railway were hit. Simultaneously, an enemy plane infiltrated Guangzhou for aerial reconnaissance to provide cover for enemy aircraft flying north to select targets. After bombing the Yuehan Railway that night, they returned to Guangzhou at 8:40 AM on the 27th. When they reached the South Station of the Yuehan Railway (i.e., Huangsha Station), they flew low and strafed the station's anti-aircraft artillery positions with machine guns. Descending from above, they dropped four bombs from several hundred feet above the station. One bomb hit the station's material depot, and another landed on a coal pile on the bank within the station, immediately causing a fire with black smoke and flames. One bomb landed near the Zhengjia Ancestral Hall beside the station's west corner, destroying thirty to forty civilian houses and killing over twenty residents. Chen Yuzhang, the chief of the 2nd branch of the 6th division of the Yuehan Railway police, and Inspector Hu were killed instantly by enemy machine-gun fire. Several railway police officers and passengers were also injured. After their rampage, the enemy aircraft quickly flew southeast. On that day, during the bombing of the Yuehan South Station, the enemy also resorted to trickery, sending three heavy bombers from Taiwan to sneak across the Fujian-Jiangxi border, intending to fly to the Hunan border to bomb the Yuehan Railway's Lechang iron bridge. However, our air force detected them and dispatched aircraft to lie in wait. Before the enemy aircraft reached Lechang, they intercepted them from above. The enemy heavy bombers were caught off guard, and two crashed into mountain ravines and were destroyed. The remaining aircraft, damaged and panicked, turned back. When flying over the Xiamen sea, they could not sustain themselves and crashed into the sea. The pilots were rescued by a British merchant ship. In this battle, all three enemy heavy bombers were destroyed, truly a gratifying victory in aerial combat. On the 28th, enemy aircraft bombed various counties near Guangzhou again. Starting around 7:00 AM, eighteen enemy aircraft were dispatched, divided into three groups. One group flew to Humen to bomb, one flew to Baisha (under Dongguan County) to drop bombs, and one flew between Huangpu and Xinzhou, attempting to bomb Cantonese warships anchored in the river. A total of four bombs were dropped in Huangpu, five in Humen, and two in Baisha. Around 10:00 AM, three more enemy aircraft flew to Humen for reconnaissance. Around 2:00 PM, six enemy aircraft flew over Guangzhou to Conghua, dropping seven or eight bombs on a certain location in the county, destroying dozens of civilian houses and killing over thirty villagers. At the same time, the area near Qingjiang in the North River was also bombed by enemy aircraft, burning over thirty thatched huts, with casualties among the villagers as well. Around 5:00 PM, the enemy aircraft returned, and when passing over the Huangpu River, they bombed Cantonese warships in the river again, with four bombs hitting villages along the banks, causing over a hundred casualties. Around 6:00 PM, the air raid alert in Guangzhou was lifted.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the enemy dispatched over twenty warships and one aircraft carrier to probe Humen Fortress, attempting to land. At the same time, enemy aircraft attacked Humen and Cantonese warships in Huangpu four times. Around 9:00 AM, eighteen enemy aircraft flew to the Humen and Changzhou area to bomb and attack patrol boats along the river. Humen Fortress immediately returned fire, and the enemy failed. At noon, six more enemy aircraft arrived to continue bombing and dropped bombs on Changzhou, Yuzhu, Xinzhou, and various villages, destroying over a hundred village houses and killing hundreds of farmers. At 3:30 PM, three enemy aircraft bombed Cantonese warships in Huangpu again, resulting in slight damage to the stern of the Zhaohe warship. Around 7:00 PM in the evening, eight enemy aircraft attempted to attack the West River, flying near Jiangdou, but were driven away by our air force. On the 30th, the enemy dispatched aircraft six times to Humen, Huangpu, Yuzhu, Xinzhou, and surrounding areas, taking turns bombing. From 8:40 AM to 9:15 AM, three enemy aircraft arrived in Huangpu and dropped two bombs on Laqi Mountain. At 9:00 AM, two more enemy aircraft came and dropped two bombs near the Huangpu Martyrs' Memorial, destroying several civilian houses and causing over ten casualties. At 1:00 PM, three enemy aircraft flew to Yuzhu Market, attempting to bomb the Hai'ou warship anchored there, bombing four times, each time dropping nine bombs. One bomb hit near the Hai'ou warship, injuring four sailors. Soon after, enemy aircraft flew to Xinzhou and dropped two bombs, damaging over ten village houses. At 4:00 PM, two enemy aircraft returned to bomb the Hai'ou warship, bombing once before and once after. Several bombs hit nearby villages and attempted to fly to Shipai to bomb Sun Yat-sen University, but were repelled by our anti-aircraft artillery. (October 2nd)</p>

<h3>Delivery of Public Bonds Has Not Yet Been Implemented</h3>
<p>The Exchange and the Banking Sector Are Negotiating</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued an order to implement the delivery of public bond accounts in the exchange, the exchange had already issued a notice on the 29th of last month allowing the delivery. However, due to the difficulty of brokers' procedures, the large public bond accounts and the huge amount of margin remain shelved, and there is still no destination, which has aroused the concern of social figures. Currently, brokers have submitted a list of customers with delivery difficulties to the authorities, reaching forty-eight companies (the brokers in the exchange with transactions are only about sixty). The reasons they hold are almost all related to the war and the unclear addresses of customers. Therefore, although the Ministry of Finance has clearly ordered delivery, it has not yet been implemented. The brokers have repeatedly held meetings to try to break the deadlock. The day before yesterday, they decided to send three representatives to hold a joint meeting with the exchange and the banking sector to discuss new methods. They met yesterday (the 13th) afternoon, but because the Ministry of Finance has a clear order, and the methods proposed by the brokers are too far from reality, the result is still no solution, and another meeting will be held on the 15th. It will not be possible to make a decision in the short term.</p>
<h3>Situation of Relief for Children in War Zones</h3>
<p>Zheng Orphanage is Handling Admissions; Chen Tiesheng Cables from Zhengzhou</p>
<p>Chen Tiesheng, the deputy general secretary of the China Child Welfare Association, was ordered to go west in June of this year to handle the relief of disaster-stricken children. Now, a telegram has been received from him from Zhengzhou reporting that since the outbreak of the war in North China, the refugee trains on the Pinghan Railway have been extremely crowded. Currently, the Refugee Relief Office in Zhengzhou has registered over 30,000 refugees, and countless others are visiting relatives and friends and finding their own solutions. In various refugee camps, women and children account for the majority. Many children were separated from their parents during the escape, or their parents have died in the ruthless artillery fire. They spend their days crying and calling for their parents. This kind of heartbreaking and tragic situation cannot be described in words. The Zhengzhou Orphanage has begun to handle the admission of children, and all expenses are temporarily raised locally. However, this war of resistance is a long-term one. What to do in the future, to make an overall plan, and to preserve the vitality of national revival is the important responsibility of our country and society. Chen Jun has temporarily concluded his mission and has now left Zhengzhou for Shanghai and will arrive soon.</p>
<h3>Eight-Year-Old Wang Changcheng Donates a Telescope</h3>
<p>Designated for General Li Zongren</p>
<p>The Shanghai Comfort Committee yesterday received a telescope from the China Exchange Bank, purchased with the savings of eight-year-old Wang Changcheng, specifically donated to General Li Zongren, who recently arrived in Nanjing. The committee issued a receipt and will arrange for its delivery immediately.</p>
<h3>Pu Qiting Donates a Raincoat to a Brave Warrior</h3>
<p>Merchant Pu Qiting, admiring the brave warrior Zhu Kunshan, who valiantly broke the bridge at the Yunzaobang recently to block the enemy's route, specially purchased a double-sided cashmere raincoat, worth thirty yuan, and sent it to the Comfort Committee for Zhu Kunshan to use, expressing his respect.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Allocates Suspended Personnel</h3>
<p>Those Who Are Willing to Be Transferred Will Be Paid; Those Who Voluntarily Return to Their Hometowns Will Retain Their Positions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government Secretariat yesterday sent a letter to various bureaus, stating that the registration of personnel who remained in Shanghai with suspended pay has been completed. As ordered by the mayor, those who are willing to be transferred will be paid 15 yuan per month if their original salary was below 50 yuan, and 30 yuan per month if their original salary was above 51 yuan. Those who voluntarily return to their hometowns will retain their positions with suspended pay. The secretariat will inform various bureaus and report separately for approval within two days.</p>
<h3>The Martial Law Command Announces the Protection of Merchants' and Civilians' Freight Transportation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Martial Law Command issued an announcement yesterday, stating, "During wartime, the transportation of merchants' and civilians' goods is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood and to the long-term war of resistance. In addition to strictly investigating and preventing traitors from aiding the enemy and preventing merchants from manipulating the market, the transportation of legitimate merchants' and civilians' goods should be protected and facilitated. However, the ships and goods of merchants and civilians coming to Shanghai from the interior, passing through suburban towns or passing through the city streets, have been illegally extorted by local organizations and their affiliated police and labor groups. This is a complete disregard for discipline and harming the people. It is urgently ordered and announced for general knowledge that if such incidents occur again, they will be dealt with by military law after investigation. The victims among merchants and civilians are allowed to report to this command for strict investigation in order to maintain commercial transportation and uphold the law." In addition to issuing orders and announcements, it is hoped that subordinates will be strictly ordered to comply.</p>
<h3>Xie Junxian Transfers Longevity Gifts for Comfort</h3>
<p>Xie Junxian, the manager of the Yuyao Yingmei Tobacco Company, has always been enthusiastic about national affairs. Learning that a certain commander fighting on the front line urgently needs winter supplies, he specially transferred his wife's longevity gifts to make 300 cotton vests, which were sent to the commander's communication office in Shanghai for transportation to the front line for comfort. In addition, Yao himself is soliciting a large number of raincoats from colleagues and peers in the company, which will be sent to the front as soon as a certain number is reached.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu Donates Medicine Shipped from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, Tiger Balm and Pak Kwa Tan are the most needed medicines for soldiers on the front line and refugees in the rear. Mr. Hu Wenhu, the owner of the hall, donated twenty boxes for emergency use, but at that time, the wheel transport was blocked, and it was stranded in Hong Kong. A few months ago, Director Liu Ruiheng of the Department of Health sent a special letter and telegram to Mr. Hu requesting that he find a way to send it. Twenty boxes of oil and Tan have been sent from Hong Kong, as well as ten boxes of Tiger Balm Essence (this oil essence is the latest invention and has special effects for hemostasis, pain relief, and disinfection), which have been handed over to the Department of Health for distribution and distribution. In addition, Mr. Hu also sent three barrels of quinine from Nanyang directly to the Department of Health, as Director Liu also requested him to donate this medicine at the same time. The Shanghai branch of the hall has been out of stock for many days, and a batch has now been shipped from Hong Kong to maintain the market.</p>
