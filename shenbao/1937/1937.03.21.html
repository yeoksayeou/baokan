<h3>德王的野心㊀</h3>
<p>— 本報記者錢華</p>
<p>想利用外力做成吉思汗　是位蒙古學者具有天才</p>
<p>從前的蒙古地方自治政務委員會設在百靈廟，辦公處是一個極大的蒙古包，內部佈置十分富麗堂皇。每年開大會時，要容納二百多人，也分成許多小室，會議廳舖着很厚的地毯，裝着新式火爐，跟洋樓大廈也不差什麼，許多蒙古王公都出入其間，祕書長德王更常川來往，百靈廟向來是宗敎區域，並且是蒙漢交易所的大商塲，自蒙政會設立以來，更成為內蒙政治中心。這次綏戰發生，又成為匪偽軍作戰的根據地，其在地勢上的重要性眞是與日俱增。</p>
<p>從前凡是到過百靈廟的中外旅客，或其他團體，必定要先拜會這位內蒙古新派領袖兼任蒙政會秘書長的德王，他們所得到的印象都異口同聲的說是很好。現在這位德王已是匪偽軍發號施令的傀儡領袖了，傀儡的幕後操縱者便是舉世所指的某方，某方根據那一貫的滿蒙政策，高喊着內蒙為帝國國防第一綫的口號，積數十年的經營佈置，鼓動挑撥，使內部分化崩裂；以坐收漁人之利，這也是天經地義之事，毫無足奇。但是聰明的德王為什麼肯甘心受某方的搬弄利用呢？確是件值得研究的問題，也是解决內蒙問題一個重要關健，所謂知己知彼，方能百戰百勝。記者在百靈廟的時候，把這事經過一番調查，訪問過許多從前接近德王的人物，在綏遠在張家口在北平也搜集了不少材料，如今概述如下。</p>
<p>㊀不懂日本話</p>
<p>德王的姓名全文呌德穆楚克棟魯普，現年三十六歲，生在察哈爾錫林果勒盟蘇尼特右旗。（又名西蘇尼特旗）前淸光緒三十四年方才承襲蘇尼特右旗札薩克郡王職位，民國元年駐張家口時，加封為親王職。民國八年正式接札薩克印，民國十四年段祺瑞在北平召集善後會議，德王代表錫，烏、伊三盟出席大會，被任為臨時參政院參政。民國十五年升任錫林果勒盟副盟長，十九年任察哈爾省政府委員。二十二年蒙古地方自治政務委員會成立任委員兼秘書長，二十三年察省境內蒙古各盟旗羣地方自治政務委員會成立，任委員長。德王幼年求學于綏遠及北平的蒙藏學校，漢文很有根基，說得一口極流利的北平話，後來他在王府裏請了一位美國敎員，研究英文，和歐美各國的政治經濟軍事學識，對於一般的國際形勢頗為明白。</p>
<p>他的英文程度勉强可以和英美人士敷衍幾句，但是很能用功，訂閱許多份中外報紙，關心着世界時事的演變，在許多蒙古王公中，他的思想和學問的確是最新穎的了。因為這次匪偽和某方的關係，許多人說他是日本留學生，其實他壓根兒不會講日本話，最近許多日本軍人到王府去拜訪他，都是由特務機開長盛島少將做翻譯的，從他個人歷史過程方面看來，傾向於歐美的成份較多。他的足跡除郤東三省華北外，始終沒有踏上扶桑三島的土地，和日本人的往還是最近幾年來事，說他是日本留學生，會日本話，眞是太偏於想像了。（未完）</p>

<h3>中國經濟建設的根本問題</h3>
<p>— 連士升</p>
<p>三百年來的英國之所以雄視全球，因為她是個工業先進國。大戰後的美日之所以稱霸東西洋，因為她們的生產力有驚人的進步。近年的蘇聯之所以叱咤一世，因為她的兩個五年計劃能够相繼成功。生在競爭劇烈的今日，一個沒有積極的經濟建設做後盾的國家，不但不能使大衆安居樂業，而且無法禦侮圖存。所以我們當前的任務，必須一面督促政府擬好合理化的經濟建設的計劃，一面鼓勵大衆抱定任勞耐苦地實行計劃的决心，然後才能够渡過難關，達到復興的目的。</p>
<p>事實上，中國經濟建設的重要性，政府早巳知道，並且這幾年巳經有意識地做出一番事業——最顯明的是修理公路。這些成續的確是難能可貴，但從經濟建設本身着想，我們還有許多事情急待補充。我認為中國經濟建設如要指日成功，必須喚起大衆的注意：要喚起大衆的注意，必須先有切實的成續；要有切實的成績，必須從下列的幾個根本問題做起。</p>
<p>這些根本問題是什麼呢？</p>
<p>第一須集中資本。現代工業的趨勢是大規模的生產，而大規模的生產實基於大規模的組織。不過這種生產法及組織法只有資本雄厚的大公司和國營事業才可望成功，少數人的微薄能力實在談不到。大規模生產的益處，是：生產者能够得到廉價的原料，减少無謂的經手費辦公費，充分利用工廠和工人的能力，結果，成本减輕，定價低廉，並且能壟斷各地市場。現代日本的棉業之所以能够打倒英國，主要的是因為她把全國許多棉工廠歸併到七十一家，把資本總數增加到五萬萬多日金，其中如東洋棉業公司的實收資本就有五千五百萬日金。資本這樣雄厚，廠主才有能力建築最適用的工廠，聘請最能幹的專家，設備最新式的機器，更助以消息靈通，辦事敏捷，當然操縱市塲，易如反掌。</p>
<p>原則上，我相信沒有一個人會反對集中資本的。但是，中國是個窮國，那裏來得許多資本，供政府按步就班地作經濟建設。我想資本的籌備，除陳公博先生在實業四年計劃裏所說的火柴和捲烟公賣的辦法外，還可採用兩個方法。一個方法是節流。現在中央政府的機關實在太多，有些事情本來一個機關可以辦得通的，却分開幾個機關來辦，弄得增加許多費用。光就經濟建設而論，這事情責成實業部，交通部，鐵道部來合辦已經很够，可是這幾年來我們除設立一個經濟委員會外，又有國民經濟運動委員會，國民經濟計劃委員會等機關。機關一多，開支自然增加，而組織的鬆懈猶其餘事。假如中央政府能把這些機關歸併在一起，成立一個全國經濟建設委員會，每年至少可省一筆大開支。又，中國的軍費大部分用在糧餉之上，軍備倒不講究。這班抗敵不足，滋亂有餘的兵士應該大加淘汰，把糧餉的開支節省下來購買軍火和補充經濟建設費。另一個方法是利用外資。一九二三年後日本的經濟建設是靠英美的借欵來維持，一九二八年蘇聯第一次五年計劃剛實行時也得外國人才的幫助。現在中央政府旣然有意從事建設，不妨很誠懇地向我們的眞正友邦提出合作的方法和條件。這條路如走得通，我們的資本的來源不怕沒有把握。</p>
<p>第二須因時制宜。資本的缺乏是中國經濟建設的大阻礙，所以我們支配用欵時須根據確實的統計調查，然後計劃什麼事業先辦，什麼事業後辦，什麼事業多辦，什麼事業少辦。否則步伐一亂，舉措失宜，建設的成續未見，而我們僅有的一些資本已經用完，以後再籌資本，另起爐竈，其困難將十倍於今日。我認為目前中國的經濟建設須嚴守地域分工的原則，中央統籌全局，發縱指示，地方充分利用最豐富的特產，專門發展一兩種實業，如長江流域的米，華北的棉花，西北的皮貨，沿海各省的水產，江浙的蠶絲，江西的瓷，雲南四川的藥材，福建的漆，廣東的菓植。因其勢而利導之，其成績一定比學步邯鄲，舍己從人的辦法更可觀。年來國內談經濟建設者多偏重發展交通和重工業。這些固然重要，但是實際上重工業的成本太重，我們暫時實在力不從心，同時交通不過一種工具，最緊要的是我們須多生產一些東西來利用這工具。不然，我們的生產力如果老是落後，那交通工具的發展適足增加敵人走私的便利，何苦費了九牛二虎之力專給敵人效勞。</p>
<p>第三須去華就實。愛鋪張，不切實，是一般人的通病，從事經濟建設的人也不能例外。人家說繁榮都市，我們也要繁榮都市，而繁榮的方法，不是費幾千萬元去建築幾十落高大的洋樓，聊當點綴門面，便是費幾百萬元來修理古物，藉以粉飾昇平。長官享樂，經理中飽，而大衆不但不能嘗到一點建設的滋味，反因建設的緣故，憑空增加無數負擔。這樣建設，實難得到大衆的同情。我以為中國經濟建設的根本問題，不在沒有計畫，而在太多計畫；不在不能創始，而在不能持久。無論誰上台，都來一個冠冕堂皇的計畫，有了計畫，就不問經濟來源是否有把握，某種事業是否能辦得成功，貿貿焉舉辦，甚至只有計畫和機關，不肯認眞辦一兩件事業者。今後補救之法，必須按可能的經濟來源來定合理化的計畫，計畫經過審定公布之後，必須用全力使之實行，最好能在預定的期間內實行成功，如蘇聯五年計畫四年完成一樣。萬一現任長官因事卸職，繼任者須善體前人的意志，以國家前途為重，不輕改計畫，不多設機關，不隨便進退人員，總期未完成的計畫能够及時完成，不至半途而廢。這樣才能够得到切實的成續，才能够喚起大衆的注意而得大衆的擁護。</p>
<p>現在經濟建設的呼聲已傳遍全國。甚願直接負責的人能够籌備充分的資本，發展地方巳有的實業，少鋪張，多工作，行之十年，中國一定有復興的希望。到那時，國家一切大難，都可以迎刃而解了。</p>
<h3>日外相佐滕向衆院宣稱即與各國開具體談判</h3>
<p>前此演說僅補充而未更正　此後處事决心不亞於軍部</p>
<p>［東京］審議十二年度追加豫算案之衆議院預算大會、自午前十時半開會、由政友會本村正義要求米內海相、將日本海軍曾對於成都北海兩事件所取之態度、停止速記、而加以詳細說明、其次由民政黨工藤鐵男質問、對於佐藤外相之新外交方針、國民均在注視之中、其關於在貴衆兩院所發表之尊見、其後未知何故屢有更正、在他人觀之、或恐易惹疑惑、在衆議院發表之意見、為何復於貴族院有補充之必要、願聞其故、</p>
<p>佐藤外相答、余在貴衆兩院之演說、並無更正必要、且余未認為有應行更正之處、不過補充之意義、並非推翻前說、此為余在貴族院之同樣說明、今後卽將與各國開始具體交涉、甚望在事前準備步驟、以利進行、</p>
<p>工藤問、處於今日擴張軍備之時代、外相應極力鎮定、㧞躍各界人材於外交界、以圖外交一新、未知有無此項决意、</p>
<p>外相答、余認為歷來之外相、均具有此項决心、處於今日重大時局、此項决心更有必要、自不待言、現今內閣應與外交完全一致、軍部亦應與之成為一體、互相援助、均毋待論之情形也、駐外軍部、以非常之决心處事、此種踴躍精神、實堪敬佩、余覺今後亦須以不亞於軍部之决心而處事、尤其鑑於我商權之發展、余更痛感此種决心之必要、余雖力薄、但對於今後機構之改革、人材之錄用、自當充分留意、尤以提用適材、今後更須努力、</p>
<p>林首相答、對於外務機構之改革及人事、現正熱心考究、</p>
<p>其次由政友八角三郎質問、外相對於今日之我國預算、是否認為擴張軍備、又對於所謂滿洲事件以後之危機語句、請加以說明、至於所謂“忍耐”、在雙方主張各不相讓之際、亦如此否、又如時間一至、是否有意隨時造成排外的集團、請問外相對於外交國策之根本方針若何、外相答、余僅對於工藤之質問、述及决心而已、關於外交之危機、可閱當時之紀錄、卽能明瞭、所謂“忍耐”係立足於國際正義、在彼方對我之際、一旦交涉停頓、固不必以此而絕望、萬一對方國採違背國際正義態度時、自應由對方國負責，至於所謂排外的集團云云、全認為尚非其時、外交國策之根本方針、余在就任以前、早經决定、自當照此建以方策也、</p>
<p>八角復要求說明、外相答、充實國防、余亦為極感必要之一份子、今日之國防豫算、乃為充實國防之最小限度、當不至因此而刺激各國、</p>
<p>池崎忠孝質問、外相曾在衆議院赤字委員會述謂、極端之國家思想、乃陷於偏狹之愛國心也云云、此語究為何意、又經濟上之互惠原則、是否與對華根本原則相矛盾、</p>
<p>外相答、當時述及國家思想、原係對於留日外僑之言論與態度等節而發、又如互惠原則、當係對華外交方針之基本工作、</p>
<p>東方會之由谷義沼問、外相曾經演說、認為在對外上給與若何影響、</p>
<p>外相答、大致對於外國不至發生惡影響、</p>
<p>由谷問、例如中國之言論機關、余認為對日係採取攻勢態度、外相以為如何外相答、余以為改善國際輿論、當在進行各種交涉以前、以融和對方國感情之意義、而行使基本工作也、</p>
<p>午後十五分休息、於二時二十五分再行開會、午後六時十五分散會、（二十日同盟電）</p>

<p>主席報告</p>
<p>首由主席潘局長報告略謂、今天社會局市黨部合辦中國優秀學生聯誼會、以前市黨部曾經舉辦過、上學期因其他事故、未曾舉行、現决定黨政雙方聯合舉辦、不僅中學生、並計劃大學小學也參照此辦法舉辦優秀學生聯席誼會、茲將其意義簡單報告如下、㊀因為我們感覺到我們的國家巳到了復興開始的時期、民族已由衰落時期而轉變到興盛開始的時期、在此時期需要各方面努力、使民族能加速變的向復興大道上邁進、尤其青年之努力更為必要、青年是國家的寶貝、如所有青年對智德體羣各方面能平均發展向上努力、就可以奠定國案復興的基礎、尤其是學校讀書的青年、要鼓勵其奮發上進、一方面固然靠自己的努、同時環境的督導鼓勵亦有影響、故舉辦此優秀學生聯誼會、可以帮助其互相勉勵、使優秀基礎、不致敗壞同時更可樹立其更優良的才能、㊁一個人不能說絕對無缺點、無論何人都有一部份長處、中有一部份短處、故我們並非求大家一無瘕疵、而是要求大家能發揮其長處、使長處超過短處已經够了、中國古聖王以隱惡揚善為治國平天下之張本卽如此理、但中國近數十年來的社會風尚、適與相反、大家注意於批評別人的短處、揭發別人的壞處、結果社會上眞的沒有好人了、所以我們要轉變過來、毫無隱諱的要隱惡揚善、並從學校中做去、由師長考查優秀學生選拔出來、這樣大家都願做好學生、雖然“人不知而慍、不亦君子乎”、好學生不一定要人家知道、但給人家知道了一定更高興、論說云、“有朋自遠方來不亦樂乎”、其樂自有道理、因其學習用功、所以遠方的朋友都來看他、當然快樂了、故聯誼會就是要轉變揚惡隱善的惡習、美國一位有名的外交家弗蘭克林說他的成功、在水從來不說人家的短處、祇稱贊人家的長處、可見眞理是顚撲不破、無古今中外的、㊂求學得人的帮助最大的是名師與益友、所謂名師並不一定是鼎鼎大名、只要名副其實、克盡其職、就是名師、這名師在學校中當然有了、但益友則比較困難、故聯誼會就是代替你們挑選一批最好的朋友、互相勉勵督促、對各位自己以及國家民族有很大的影響、上海有一個同文書院、似乎大家不十分知道、但是中國人對於中國的情形不明瞭的時候、去問同文書院他們究全明瞭、因為他們每屆學生於假期到中國各地去旅行考察、報告學校、久而久之、自然都明瞭了、上海有很多的學校、且來自各地、但為什麼自己各地的情形反而不能盡知呢、因為沒有組織、言是辦教育的故處、故聯誼會就要發揮各人的長處、結合起來、互相團結切磋、一批一批做下去、對國家民族一定有很大的貢獻云、</p>
<p>陶委員詞</p>
<p>次市黨部陶公委員百川致詞、介紹德•蘇•美三國的青年運動情形、因此三國代表了法西斯蒂•共產黨•民主政治三種不同的政體、㊀德國青年運動有希特拉青年團、規定十歲至十歲者參加、過去是自由參加、而現在是强迫的、其方法卽在各地設立夏會營、許多青年、到假期、都到附近的營內去、結合紥營、自己生活、使彼此見面可以聯絡感情交換智識、德國的夏會營對世界有很大的貢獻、我們希望上海也能有此設備、使上海學生以及內地到上海的青年、都能享受、較住旅館有益得多、其次是勞働服務團、現在中國也有、他們規定十九歲以上者必須加入、否則畢業以後不能找職業、時間是半年、工作是築堤•伐木•造船•改良耕地等、每日服務八小時、無報酬、畢業後給以證書、持此證書可以在社會上找職業、所以這已變成了義務、中國現在尚是志願的㊁蘇俄的青年訓練日先鋒隊、凡十歲至十六歲者都應參加、他們有五條規則、㊀隊員應保護自己及人家的身體㊁要對於時間經濟不要浪廢、利用課餘、工作要迅速、㊂應勤勞、堅忍不拔並能與人合作、㊃要愛惜公物和私物㊄不要創誓、不要吸烟、不要喝酒、规則以外並有五條願詞、其中、條可提出、第一條隊員應立定志向將來為工人農人及平民謀福利、卽不要錦上添花、要雪中送炭、第五條應用功求學因智識與技能為替工農平民謀福利的最大力量、先鋒隊之上有共產黨青年團、卽CX、從前專做搖旗吶喊貼標語喊口號工作、出自去年開始己不准做此項政治活動而做讀書•運動•軍訓三項工作、尤其注意於運動、現俄國有四千五百五十個體育塲、八百個游泳池可見一斑、運動好的中央政府給以CXO獎牌、其意義為勞働及國防的準備、㊂美國的青年運動組織有CCC、卽公民志願保存團、做保存森林的工作、因美國產木甚多、遍處是大塊森林、如遇虫蛀火燒損失很大、故招失業青年送入軍隊、由軍官編制後送至森林房紮營、早晨受軍馴、白天造橋築路、並注意森林、工作八小時、晚上在營中讀書、敎的是職業智識、衣食由國家供給、每月報酬三十元、但必須以二十五元寄回家、三年前開始組織、至去年統計已有五十餘萬人、築了十萬哩路、三萬條橋五百萬畝森林的虫、一百五十條壩、其偉大可知從以上奉國家的青年訓練、得到而結論、㊀從前的青年運動是學校做的、現在則學校做以外、政府黨部也在做、可以劃一步驟了、㊁從前的訓練祇是訓練人、現在則陳人之外還要訓練成民、人民二字是有不同的、人是社會方面看民是國家方面看民固然是人、人不一定是民、好的民卽好的人、但好的人不一定是好的民、㊂從前的訓練是靜的、現在的訓練是動的、我們中國的新生活運動、勞働服務運動亦是這樣、希望大家努力幹去云、</p>
<p>蔣科長詞</p>
<p>次蔣科長致詞、略謂本人在中學時代、那時也有過模範生的選拔、標準以智德體服務能力等優良者入選、這些模範生常常為其他同學服務、五四運動時卽舉這些模範生領導愛國工作、做事很順利同學很信仰、故由此我得到二點感想、㊀優秀學生應當是為別人服務的、所以是服務生、㊁學生運動自五四以後、一般做工作的祇會活動、而學識道德體格都不好的、所以不能領導、故我們要優秀生來造風氣、做榜樣云、</p>
<p>學生演說</p>
<p>旋由主席團抽定高中三人初中三人演說、題目由社會局指定十二題如下、㊀忠勇為愛國之本㊁孝順為齊家之本、㊂仁愛為接物之本㊃信義為立業之本㊄和平為處與之本、㊅禮節為治世之本、㊆服從為負責之本、㊇勤儉為服務之本、㊈整齊為強身之本、㊉助人為快樂之本、㊉㊀學問為濟世之本、㊉㊁有恒為成功之本、抽得者任擇一題、每人講演時間五分鐘、計高中為南洋中學卓寶珩、講仁愛為接物之本、務本姚蓮娟講有恒為成功之本、私立上中黃延平講禮節為治世之本、初中為育材楊人濟講有恒為成功之本、中華職校黃南昌講學問為濟世之本、審美女中沈德華講有恒為成功之本、各生講題均臨時抽定、但尚能流俐講出、頗為難能、</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>馮念華缺席中華籃球隊敗於軍校</h3>
<p>結果四十八比五十九　今日二次比賽小馮趕到</p>
<p>▲中央社南京二十日電　滬中華籃球隊王南珍等一行、由敎練黎寶駿率領、十九日抵京、二十日下午四時與軍校作首次對抗於業餘體育會、觀衆千餘人、中華馮念華陳祥龍未到、實力大减軍校以五十九比四十八獲勝、上半時二十九比二十五、軍校僅勝四分、最後五分鐘時、成四十平等、中華長力不濟、因以致敗、王玉增帶病出塲、未見精彩、鮑文沛郭震極活躍、中華以王南珍周達雲最出色、二十一日下午三時、在原處作二次對抗、中華馮陳二將二十日晚將趕到、勝負未可預測、</p>
<h3>十四隊參加今日江灣越野賽跑</h3>
<p>中西賽員達百四十餘人　十一時在虹口公圍起步</p>
<p>上海體育會主辦六英哩江灣團體越野錦標賽、定今日上午十一時正、在虹口公園西邊門起步、此次蘇壳爾麥令斯兩隊、因事未及報名、故參與角逐者僅十四隊、每隊十人錄取前八名、個人參加者十七人、包含國籍計有中英美法俄日印等諸國健兒、內華人竟佔有九十一人之多、玆將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>比賽規則</p>
<p>㊀每隊以八人或十人為一隊、惟首先達到終點之八人計分、其餘作為個人、㊀各隊論賞在賽畢後制定、以得分最少之一隊為優勝隊、㊀賽員不得越出規定路綫兩旁十二碼、並不得抄越捷徑、違者取消之、各段均派有裁判員、至賽畢後將該賽員等之號碼報告、如發現中途退出或抄越捷徑等、㊀賽員須將號布別在胸前及背後、各隊長應檢查所屬、是否依照本規則辦理、㊀賽員不得欵步而行、㊀如有發生各種爭論事件、由裁判長决定之、㊀賽員須曾居本市滿二月以上者、</p>
<p>團體方面實力之强者當推烏合、惟烏合僅擁有王正林•吳文林•凌學文•管友文•張良等、然陣容並不若何整齊、次則上海體育會甲組、則有鈕鴻銓•李度安•馬日吉•高拔生•西朋•牛其堡等、均係有數之名將、冠軍當為烏合與上海體育會爭奪無疑、</p>
<p>個人方面</p>
<p>個人冠軍則為王正林•吳文林•鈕鴻銓•凌學文等所必爭、惟王正林之實力、不及吳文林之强、每次練習時常見吳文林讓王正林先到、回憶上屆冠軍王正林與吳文林相隔尺許、可想而知、他如李度安馬日吉•高拔生•西朋等、均有前十名之希望、</p>

<h3>昨夜雲南路濟華堂大火燒</h3>

<p>一時半方撲滅</p>
<p>昨夜十一時四十三分、該號毘鄰中央影戲院北首第五十一號樓下、突然起火、頃刻燎原、中央救火會全部車輛、趕往施救、歷一小時半之久、方獲撲滅、但該號全部巳盡付一炬、南首之仁濟善堂、及北首之中央戲院均未波及、</p>
<p>扶梯斷職員傷</p>
<p>該號每晚九時左右、卽打烊、故火起時、店中職員二十餘人、均入睡鄕、而最覺不幸者、卽五十一號樓下、適為扶梯所在、首先燒斷、致有學徒江北人毛銀長、（年十七歲）及江北人老司務設富發、（年二十八歲）均遭火灼傷、並躍樓跌傷頗重、</p>

<p>火熾時香氣溢</p>
<p>至起火原因、有謂藥品中含有烈性爆發者、有謂電氣走火者、傳說紛紜、但究屬何因、捕房正在調查、又該號因代售化裝品類、故當火熾時、香氣四溢、致路人駐足而觀者益衆、至本報截稿時、火勢尚未全滅</p>

<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市况仍見勉力續漲、除甲種外、各種均再見新高價、市價如此狂高、買户不嫌其昂、謡傳種種、均覺各不符實、按之實際、實與公債上漲無關、此次上漲原因、多數係金紗兩帮、仿造抬做棉紗辦法、一方奮勇買進近期、不惜抬高市價、以提起一般人之趣興、一方奮勇賣出遠期、爲數則竭力超出進數、近期則備欵收貨、遠期則預備將來現品提交、此種做手、祗需、故市價前途、下週起、本月份尚有兩日、市價恐尚不能讓其驟小、迨三月份停止後、則市價漲跌、做手可不必與聞、聽其自然、但因現貨交出甚多、市價自然由散户多方之出籠、一蹶不振、故危險當尚在後、昨日經過、上午開盤、祗戊種補漲七角及一角、入後即行轉疲、稍起回風、略小一角至四角半、五號十號三十二及四十三號賣出、次盤多方再行拉提、操縱不遺於力、除本月戊種小四角外餘則一律回好一角至四角、惟其拉提力已屬有限、午後開盤、抬戊種遠期、驟好七角、後列自然有散户代爲抬價、惟甲種紙好一角左右收盤賣方懾於買氣之盛旺、漸見縮手、多方乃亦不必再抬、前列稍小、後列稍堅、但多方惟恐人心之不堅、而實力已見不足、乃從事抬高金長及九六、金長狂漲三四元、九六又衡出十元大關、旁敲側擊、以亂人目、前途之危險、亦與日俱深矣、市價結果、又一致上漲二三角至一元、丙種本月無上落、成交總數共計一千戏百四十三萬五千元、兹將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>現銷比較遜色</p>
<p>近期紗午後猛跌</p>
<p>紗市晨漲午跌、氣勢轉趨平庸、以連朝狂騰之美棉忽而連跌三日、三品紗亦回挫、同時現紗銷塲雖屬不惡、但較上日爲少、查一星期來成交已在二萬五六千包之鉅、暫時或有一度停頓、於是多頭獲利了結、市盤稍見回風、然金業帮有一部份由空翻多、印商派亦扒空不少、前途情形若何、當仍依實需爲進退也、</p>
<p>標紗遠期起伏尚微</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美種連跌三日、三品紗亦見下落、各月微見下挫、詎料二盤開拍、近期檯面忽緊、散户扒補尤急、實以數日來紗銷起色、且有某某兩君把持甚烈、因此市態較挺、惟遠月受海外紗花市况回疲影響、而形平疲、標紗結果近月比上日收盤價漲一元至一元一角、遠跌九角、午後開盤、市况參差、形勢稍挫、二盤以後、近期步步下跌、同時現紗生意不若上日之旺、本月份據云大豐廠套出二千包、收盤下跌愈厲、遠月尚平、結果本月比上午收盤價猛跌二元一角、四月亦跌一元二角、遠月漲一角及勿動、賣出恒益一千一百包、合興五千二百包、賡豐二千九百五十包、昶記八百包、望泰興三千八百包、泰昌一千二百五十包、益昶三千一百包、明德四千七百包、澄記八百五十包、買進大豐二千包、大孚一千包、錦昌四千七百五十包、申大一千一百包、森康二千三百五十包、長豐八千包、大昶一千三百包、生源二千四百包、同和二千二百五十包、一日間最高低市價列左、</p>
<p>現紗銷路二千餘包</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚稱不薄、查全日各帮買去統計二千一百六十九包、售價漲一·二元不等、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>海外紗花猛跌</p>
<p>棉市亦轉向下游</p>
<p>本月花交貨充足</p>
<p>檯面一片賣出聲</p>
<p>棿市續疲因美棉又跌、比高價時回落五十磅音、印棉亦隨之而大跌、三品花跌風尤熾、兼之本月份交貨籌碼充足、且均係十六支原料爲多、此項棉花目前廠方需要不旺、於是市態更見萎靡矣、</p>
<p>標花隨外棉再跌</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月續落、因美棉續跌十九至二十三磅音、印棉跌風猛烈、有五羅比半至七羅比七五、大阪三品花跌一元以外、於是人心怠懈、加之本月份交貨籌碼充足、標花結果各月比上日收盤價、均跌一角半、午後開盤、獲利者補空益夥、市况反見堅挺、後以紗市乏力、復趨下落、結果本月比上午收盤價跌一角半、其餘漲跌五、查賣出長豐二萬三千六百擔、經華五千五不擔、吉豐二千八百擔、振大二千五百擔、仁豐二千擔、泰昌八千九百擔、恒昌二千二百擔、同和三千五百擔、益昶二千八百擔、昶記一千一百擔、梅記一千二百擔、永大一千擔、買進潤康一萬一千四百擔、大孚三千四百擔、裕大六千擔、大豐八千六百擔合興二千八百擔、賡豐一千六百擔、大昌成五千八百擔、大昶二千擔、信誠三千五百擔、長和四千八百擔、生源二千五百擔、兹將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>細絨棉廠辦仍暢</p>
<p>現棉消費稍見淸淡、惟細絨花廠家需用仍暢、售開九百零四包、碼頭到貨絶無、</p>
<p>美棉多頭不斷了結</p>
<p>非有新刺激似難上漲</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、趨勢疲軟、價跌十一至十九磅音、晨初交易活動、惟國外消息不振、國內外多頭了結、工潮及華盛頓方面對於貨物之意見、殊難臆測、故市價跌落、同業及空户頗有買進、惟多頭了結、繼續不斷、就目前形勢、似需新刺激、方能上漲、德國方面、交易甚暢、現棉静寂、布市呆滯、收盤平疲、計現貨跌二十三磅音、期貨跌十九至二十三磅音、英棉現貨跌十六點、期貨跌十三四點、印棉初因多頭了結而跌、旋因經紀商買進而堅、卒因空户抛售再疲、計平果爾跌五羅比半、奥姆辣跌五至六羅比半、白羅溪跌七·二五至七·七五羅比、原電錄左、（十九日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百四十二羅比、奥姆辣爲二百三十一羅比、平果爾爲一百九十二羅比七五、均跌二·七五羅比、</p>
<p>日紗花一致傾跌</p>
<p>十日大阪電、現紗跌四至六元、十六支扇面　百四十二元、跌六元、二十支金魚二百六十二元、跌四元、四十支五星四百元、漲五元、四十二支雉子三百九十元、不動、三品期紗跌七角至一元六角、近月爲二百五十八元、遠月爲二百五十九元四角、期棉跌七角至一元四角、近月爲七十九元、遠月爲八十一元一角五分、</p>
<p>漢津紗市上漲不少</p>
<p>青島期紗後市回漲</p>
<p>青島　二十日同盟社青島電、青島取引所松鹿標紗、前市跌七角半至二元半、標布跌二分半至五分、後市標紗漲二·二五至三元、標布漲二分半至五分、原電錄後、</p>
<p>漢口　又漢口現紗漲一二元、現布不動、原電錄後、</p>
<p>天津　又天津現紗漲二至四元、現布漲五分至七分半、現棉不動、原電錄後、</p>
<p>在華日紗廠積極增加紗綫錠數</p>
<p>兹據日報載、日方調查在華日廠之現有實力、紗錠爲二百十二萬二千九百八十八枚、綫錠三十六萬三千一百五十三枚、布機二萬八千六百十六台、本年內預定增加者、爲紗錠一百十五萬一千八百枚、綫錠五萬枚、布機二萬八千十六台、即本年未完成之增加率、紗錠占百分之五四·二、綫錠百分之一四、布機約百分之一○○、若一旦完成、則紗錠合計爲三百二十七萬四千七百八十八枚、將超過華廠現有之紗錠數、（現華廠紗錠爲二百九十二萬二千九百八十枚、）綫錠合計爲四十一萬三千一百五十三枚、將超過率廠綫錠二位以上、（現華廠綫錠共十七萬六千八百四十枚、）布機合計爲五萬七千一百三十二台、亦將爲華廠布機二倍以上云、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>統稅有瑁加傳說</p>
<p>棉布現貨益俏</p>
<p>昨棉布市况、東疋白貨續超堅昂、北路天津濟南等帮、進胃仍佳、成交細布·細斜·現期貨約一千餘件、價每疋漲二分半至五分、內外廠出品之四君子嗶嘰、因北銷旺動、每碼提升五厘、津帮與山西帮昨進一百二十餘箱、行盤每碼二角七分二厘半、日商行家之細布細斜現貨缺乏、期貨亦不願鬆售、復以外間有統税行將增加之傳説、同業大户墊進手貨、居奇觀望、致市上現貨益見俏俐、尤以陽鶴·龍頭·五福·三牌爲最然、衝之實際銷况、除北路外、其餘各地均未發動、而四川帮最爲呆滯、故各廠藍布去勢亦最疲弱、</p>
<p>夏令呢羢已有動辦</p>
<p>呢羢銷路昨日仍旺、大路貨因本街門市不起、交易較少、西裝貨趨勢大佳、京滬及滬杭兩路均有大量成交、然因短春關係、買方客户、提早採購夏令貨市氣隨之大變、春令應銷之人字呢等類之毛貨、顔色深沉並稍厚之花呢、出路均轉呆滯、而需銷尚早之法蘭羢螺絲呢、業皮取巴勒呢、派力斯凡立頂黄斜紋之類、走銷反甚暢旺與往年情形、大不相同、昨瑞文派力斯售開四元五角、石利洛胖皮取四元、美臣法蘭羢五元二角五分、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>期粉跌後轉穩</p>
<p>—連日慘落引起補空—</p>
<p>昨日粉市各月份呈先跌後穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌九角一元、坎拿大跌一元一二角不等、利物浦跌一便士零、當開價時、因洋麥之反跌、人心又在極度不定之際、故本月份開價曾小至八角一分、惟近期連朝慘落、未免過巨、因此空頭暢補、人心見挺、本月份歩歩高昂、較初開回好三分、四月份亦初小而後振、七八月份、則天時已放晴、人心反疲、迨至下午開盤、本月份交易、已不甚暢、市已轉定、四月份祗有一分之盤旋、七八月份、因有新空户抛售、市趨平軟、觀本月份在市塲祗四天交易、此幾日中、加實銷仍寂、當須平静過去云、</p>
<p>本月麥補空得回好</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、各月份大致平静、因洋麥報價、雖回跌甚巨、惟近期方面、多空意思、逐漸接近、本月份一經空頭抵進、即回好五六分、四月份無出入、六月份以下、在新麥未有把握之前、交易當然有限、所以出入亦復有限、迨至下午開盤、本月份初尚平定、旋以近期粉市略好、客户扳售、故本月份又提好二分、六月份以下、天時已佳、遠期粉亦疲、故小去一二分、現麥市面、因標凖轉好、各檔亦喊高二三分、開天台麥六元二角二分、江蘇麥六元三角二分、次二角七分、廣水麥六元零九分、共開六七千包、由福新申大辦去云、</p>
<p>客秈銷路轉淡</p>
<p>客秈近日到頭、仍見日有一二萬包、祇因粤帮去化極貪、市面乃見步步上展、昨粤胃已淡、吃價尤緊、貨主大半願脱、市面立轉平軟、如今明去化仍淡、後市或須歩削若干也、昨日粤帮交易不足二千包、北洋與西北去路亦祇千餘包、其餘均由本街辦去、惟本街以客銷不濃、胃口亦不似日前活潑、全日開出江西米八千八百包、湘米三百包、温甬米六百三十包、</p>
<p>天晴河米斛價回小</p>
<p>—北市百元貨少漲三角—</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源與前相仿、仍祗到十五六號貨共三千三四百石、內中薄稻有十一二號、到貨雖稀、乃本銷殊淡、致形勢轉軟、市况下垂、若厚粳價暗修幾分外、早稻竟貶一角　角外不等、薄稻亦因包胃不爽、祇西安帮辦八九百包、且來派較夥、行情同落角許、觀後市趨勢、似尚難以立足也、杜尖及陰元供求相仿、悉屬平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源寥落、約十二三號、市上各貨銷路因大已轉晴、各店胃納懈淡、市形白粳價轉小七八分、薄稻價亦見軟、羊杜埠尖價帶疲勢、客尖平定、其餘各貨價形亦見疲勢、惟百元到貨稀少、零胃尚可、價好一二角、</p>
<p>荳餅走銷暢達</p>
<p>近日豆餅銷塲續見旺盛、去路以華南爲主、內地心思亦好、因大連市漲多跌少、故市場中人心有一致看好之象、昨統市計開穗豐廠四牌餅八十片、長德廠四牌餅二千片、昌記廠四牌餅二千片、大有餘廠四牌餅一萬四千片、及五牌餅五千片、又無錫恒德廠四牌餅五千片、常州恊豐廠四牌餅二萬二千片、交貨期均訂十天左右、行情比較前市略升分許、</p>
<p>標準油荳餅仍不振</p>
<p>昨標凖餅豆油各市、仍見無神、大連電訊雖見連續歩砌、惟滬上消貨甚滯、尤以黄豆到存兩充、車廠客帮均乏問津、行號客販多擬套賣標凖、奈補囤均滯、標豆開市近月立小六七分、遠小四分、午後因連電續站、人心轉定、惟本月份仍被現貨牽制、收市仍小六分、下月祗小三分、五月小一分、六月份售開六元四角、標餅進出兩平、收市無大出入、標油有多頭了結、回小一角半至五分</p>
<h3>金融</h3>
<p>標金由疲轉昂</p>

<h3>「上海節」與新兒童</h3>
<p>— 惟際</p>
<p>小朋友們！今天本刋和大家相見時，恰遇到上海各界所公定的「上海節」！全上海的人們正在熱烈地慶祝着！歡騰着！</p>
<p>十年前的今日，正是國民革命軍北伐成功而克復上海的時候：我們要檢閱以前的成功，發揚過去的光榮！那麽紀念這「上海節」是含有重大的意義的！但我們不是為上海一隅幸福而紀念慶祝，而是爲革命成功而慶祝！爲冀國家統一民族復興而慶祝！可是在此十年之中，國事歷盡了無數艱困，領土受盡了蹂躪，同胞遭遍了流離痛苦！雖然全國上下始終能本着救國宗旨，努力作决心奮鬥！然而，至今革命尚祇成功一部！失地尚未收復尺寸！那是何等悲憤的事呀！</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們是國家的新生命！全國的命脈，都聯繫在每個兒童的身上！將來國事的維持，靠你們，失土的收復，靠你們！革命的成功，靠你們！民族的復興，靠你們！你們是國家台柱！你們是民族基礎！你們是國家未來主人翁！你們的責任是何等重！你們的使命又何等大！起來吧！怒吼吧！新中國的兒童們！</p>
<p>新事業的成就，是需新兒童去創造的！强健的體格，豐富的智識，超卓的才能，勇啊的氣魄，偉大的精神，便是創造新事業的新兒童所缺一不可的條件！小兄弟，小姊妹！你具備了這幾個條件嗎？快快努力去鍊鍜吧！學習吧！培養吧！</p>
<p>「上海節」雖需要我們紀念它以前革命的光榮燦爛！但我們更需要在不久的將來創造出一個「民族復興節」來！讓我們整個中華民族來熱烈的紀念它！慶祝它！誰是「民族復興節」的創造者？就是新中國的兒童！</p>
<p>新中國的兒童！是時候了！起來吧！怒吼吧！</p>
<h3>食鹽在國防上的重要</h3>
<p>— 陳敬建</p>
<p>小朋友！你們知道嗎？現代的戰爭倘要得到最後的勝利，必須具備有偉大的大衆力量和鋒利的新式武器，這差不多是盡人皆知了。可是國防上關係極重要的戰時軍需品的儲藏，有一部份人是忽視了，這是很危險的。記起一九一四年的歐洲大戰，德國失敗之主要原因，不是為了內部經濟發生恐慌了嗎？</p>
<p>現在我先來談談國防上軍事上民食上所廹切需要的東西食鹽</p>
<p>食鹽在化學上的名稱是氣化鈉，是人類每日生理上的必需品。因爲活盛旺和心臟的增强，缺乏了牠，身體便要委頓。幾年前赤匪盤據江西，當局實行封鎖食鹽，也為成功之一大原因。可見食鹽同軍事有密切的關係。我國平時食鹽，本來是足够消費，可是長蘆鹽的輸日，結果內地尚有淡食的情形，這是很痛心的事，况且現在是到了非常時期，食鹽不儲藏充足，遇到戰事爆發，一旦沿海各省被敵人的龐大海軍佔據或封鎖時候，那末，食鹽缺乏，是可預料的，我們何不先儲藏起來呢？</p>
<p>其次將食鹽用電分解是製造氯氣，芥子氣，光生氣，等毒氣的主要原料——鈉和氯。雖然我們是酷愛和平，不製毒氣殘殺敵人，但是當敵人使用毒氣的時候，我們當然學會能坐而待斃，若　　　毒氣的侵入，唯一的消毒方法，那便是漂白粉，製造牠的最主要原料又是氯，也是鹽的分子。</p>
<p>鹽的另一成分鈉。據蘇聯學者的研究，鈉和氧同水蒸猛烈化合，所生的熱，鈉粉可作燒夷彈。因此鹽又是軍事上的重要東西。</p>
<p>總括以上，食鹽是非常時期國防上不可少的物質。我們現在應當盡量的貯藏起來，以應付敵人侵襲。這是急不容緩的處置。</p>
<h3>體温</h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>有一天，敏兒一不小心，在早晨稍受了些寒氣，起先不過傷風罷了，後來竟發起寒熱來，身上的温度不知不覺的加熱了許多，他的哥哥聰兒爲要明白他到底熱了多少度，便把一枝寒熱表塞在也嘴裏舌頭的底下，（這寒暑表不是量氣候的寒暑表，是專結量人身體的熱度的）大約隔了四五分鐘，便拿出來一看，竟高出了好多度。</p>
<p>「哥哥，我熱了幾度？一個平常人的温度是多少？」</p>
<p>你熱了兩度左右了，好好的睡一下罷，一個平常人的體温當在攝氏寒暑表三十六度半到三十七度即華氏寒暑表九十七度七分到九十八度六分的中間，你現在已經是三十九度多了，不是熱了兩度多了嗎？」</p>
<p>「體溫是怎樣發生的？為什麽平常人的體温是一定度數的？</p>
<p>「你要知道體溫的發生，好像木柴燃燒起來，就能産生熱是一樣的道理，這都是滋養料在人身體裏起氧化作用，也可説是燃燒，因爲燃燒就是氧化的一種，所以人身體裏的溫熱是由身體成分的氧化而發出。既然身體裏産生了溫熱一定要發散出去，這和火爐要裝烟囱是同理的，但體温的發散有三種方法：（一）由皮膚表面經過空氣而發散出去，（二）不由空氣做媒介而直接由皮膚表面發散出去，（三）隨着皮膚表面的水分和呼氣中的水蒸氣而發散出去，皮膚表面的水分就是汗、剛從皮膚表面出來的汗不是熱的嗎？我從嘴裏呼出的水蒸氣也不是熱的嗎？體温的發出，跟了身體的狀態而變化體温的發散也因身體的狀態和空氣的冷熱乾濕而不同但是我們的體温却常常能保持一定的度數，這就因爲身體裏有調節體温的作用能够維持體温發生的數量而發散的數量，是在平衡的狀態，因爲有這種調節作用，所以體温就不致於過分高或過分低而常能保持一定的度數，如果體温過分高或過分低，那便要生病了。」</p>
<h3>上海節與上海兒童</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今天三月二十一日，是上海市政府所規定的着屆「上海節」。全市除了熱烈的慶祝以外，並舉行各種展覽會，來歡迎「上海節」的誕生，這誠然是含有深刻的意義，和相當的價值的。</p>
<p>記得吳市長在上星期一的市府紀念週上，曾經說過：「我們規定上海節，是有很深的意義的，是合乎時代精神的。我們想到利用這個上海節，來勸工·勸農·勸商·勸學，來鼓勵市民敬業·樂羣·親愛·團結·互助·合作·奮發·生產·活潑·樂觀·進取，向上等種種精神與情緒，使整個上海市的社會，個人，都有欣欣向榮的氣象，這幾句話，說得很是懇切，實在是值得我們細細體味的。</p>
<p>我們承認，兒童是民族的根苗，是國家的未來主人翁，尤其是上海市的兒童，對於民族國家所負的使命，更加來得重大。所以，在今天上海節紀念日，全上海的兒童們，要深切的認淸，上海節並不是一個普通的節日，也並不是兒童們的娛樂節，上海節是上海的兒童們，開始努力養成勤學，親愛·團結·互助·合作·奮發·生産·活潑·樂觀·進取，向上等種種精神與德性的起點。使未來的上海社會，先在全市兒童們的身上，立下一個很鞏固的基礎，而逐漸的達到建設新上海的境界。</p>
<p>兒童們！親愛的上海兒童們！希望你們從今天的上海節起，來接受吳市長所指示的幾種優良德性，而努力培養，這才是慶祝上海的真義里。</p>
<h3>蛋會直立</h3>
<p>— 曹義瓊</p>
<p>橢圓形的雞蛋，能够把他直立起來！先把蛋用力摇動，使蛋黄與蛋白分散，再用瓶一個，不論果子露啤酒瓶都可以的，另用叉兩把，插在軟木的塞子上，不過軟木塞的一端，要適合蛋尖的，照圖上的樣子，蛋能直立在瓶蓋上面，玩這戲法時，要當心蛋落下打碎，因為生蛋碰到玻璃瓶或落在桌上就要破碎的。</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>這是第一因爲蛋黄與蛋白分較重，沈到下面去，第二兩把叉放在蛋頂，可以平衡重心，這是與不倒翁的理由相同的。</p>
<p>辨蛋的生熟</p>
<p>雞蛋四個放在盤中，三個是生蛋，一個是熟蛋，預先不要説出那一個是熟的，使人辨別生熟，這是本來很艱難的。現在我有一個法子教給你們，就是把四個蛋，一個一個在桌上用手旋轉起來，你們可以看到旋轉得很好的，就是熟蛋；旋轉不好的是生蛋了。</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>熟的蛋，其内部已煮熟成硬，變爲一個固體，所以能够旋轉得很好，生蛋的內部是液體，雖然外部的殻，能够廻旋，但是裏面的液體不能依同樣速度旋轉的緣故。</p>
<h3>尚武的遊戲</h3>
<p>— 梁光景</p>
<p>年假過後，學校一行學期考試了；一天下午考卷繳後，走過綠楊路上，打算找一個向陽地方溫課；偶一抬頭；看見七八個小朋友，在隔岸界首公園土堆上打架，他們相約那一個摔倒隨即站起來；我見了這一羣活潑的小天使，天真可愛！我關心似的問到：「考的成績好嗎？」他們答道：「還好！」接着親熱的轉問我道：「請問你先生姓什麽？」我説姓梁。走了多遠，他們一同高喊「梁先生！」由此我有兩點心得：</p>
<p>（一）與小朋友爲伍，精神上得到莫名的快慰！所以小學教師比中，大學教師高尚！　（二）小學低中年級學生應做尚武遊戲——誰説中國人愛好和平試看小孩天性尚武，不過因父母，師長為免小兒衣服弄壞，遂禁止小兒打架！要知培養成小兒尚武精神，比衣服價值大過若干倍！爲父母，師長的人，顧惜小利，影響到中華民族性的衰弱！</p>
<h3>土耳其學童的愛國思想</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>土耳其學校的兒童，每星期必唱歌兩次，那歌中有「我們是土耳其人」，「我們是正直的，勤苦工作的等詞句。每逢星期一跟星期六，那是一週中的首尾兩日，各學校都行升旗禮，連教授外國兒童跟教授少數民族的兒童，像猶太人，阿來尼亞人，希臘人等的各學校，也都要行這個禮節。行禮的當兒，全校學生都站在操塲上旗桿的四周，一見土耳其國旗升上，各學生都高唱土耳其獨立國歌，國歌唱罷，便唱宣誓歌，那歌詞的意義是「我們應該保護比我們弱的人，我們應該尊重老年人。我們應該愛我們的故鄉跟我們的國家，要勝過愛我們的自身。進步能提高國家的智識程度，我們應該把這事爲我們的目的。我們的存在、靠着土耳其民族的存在，我們應該為土耳其民族犧牲一切，倘若有需要時，還應該犧牲我們的生命。」唱畢了後，齊向國旗行敬禮，於是各人便挾着書包回家。</p>
<h3>讀書</h3>
<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>人不能不讀書，</p>
<p>也不能讀死書；</p>
<p>讀書原在致用，</p>
<p>不僅咬文嚼字做蟫魚；</p>
<p>要在書裏找生活源泉，</p>
<p>要在書裏尋救國工具；</p>
<p>除了讀書的時間，須常到大自然界體會去，</p>
<p>到大自然界體會去！</p>
<p>到大自然界體會去！</p>
<p>證實證實你所讀過的書。</p>
<h3>紙鳶</h3>
<p>— （楊志剛）</p>
<p>正月吃瓜子，</p>
<p>二月放鷂子。」</p>
<p>紙鳶又名風箏，俗稱鷂子。二月正是放紙鳶的時節，在這温和的春風裏，和暖的陽光下，一手牽着紙鳶，倒是很有趣的遊戲。</p>
<p>據生理學家的研究，放紙鳶據説是一種很合乎衛生的，怪不得有許多名流都是在提倡，東一個紙鳶比賽，西一個風箏競賽。</p>
<p>紙鳶的發明者，據説是漢時的韓信。那時韓信勸陳豨反漢，答應在他舉兵的時候，自己做內應；他因爲要掘一條地道通到未央宫去，所以創製了紙鳶，想放高了來測量未央宫的距離。不過這種傳說的可靠與否，却還是一個問題。</p>
<h3>一副小傢俱（勞作）</h3>
<p>— 誠</p>
<p>……用三個洋線休做成……</p>
<p>小朋友，你的母親或姊姊，縫衣服時，用洋線團麽？洋綫用光了，就賸下一個兩端高起，當中凹進的木頭。它可以在地上滾來滾去，很好玩的。現在請你把它們收拾起來，積成三個，就可以做成一副玲瓏小巧的傢具了。</p>
<p>如果你家裏没有洋綫木，那末到附近的相識的縫衣店裏，討三個來，他們也一定肯給你。</p>
<p>洋線木有了，我們先做起桌子來，那是最簡單的：只要用厚紙剪成圓形，黏在洋綫木的一端，像（甲）圖那樣，不是一隻很好的小圓桌子了麽？</p>
<p>第二是做花瓶，那就用得着顏色和畫筆了：用它們在洋綫木的中段，畫些好看的東西，花草也好，山水也好。再採一點碧綠的青草，插在中央的小洞裏，就是一雙可愛的花瓶了，（乙圖）</p>
<p>最後是做椅子了，那比較難一點，不過也不十分難。用厚紙剪成椅子靠背的形式，黏在洋線木的半邊，椅子就成功了。再找一小方的布頭，和一點棉花，棉花塞在布裏，四面縫起來，就成一個舒適的靠枕。把靠枕椅在椅子的靠背上（丙圖），於是全副傢俱都完成了。自然，在白地上都給漆上深一點的顔色，是更漂亮了。</p>
<p>如果你把這三樣傢俱給爸爸，媽媽，姊姊看，爸爸一定歡喜那椅子，因為他想：如果坐在這樣的椅子上看看報，多舒服啊。而媽午一定歡喜那花瓶，她是愛花若命的，她覺得這花瓶不錯。姊姊卻歡喜在這樣平滑的小桌子上，做「代數」，多好啊！</p>
<p>可惜這三樣東西都太小了。</p>
<p>故事画</p>
<h3>林林和蓓蓓</h3>
<p>— 小慧作</p>
<p>（説明）</p>
<p>（一）林林和蓓蓓在郊外旅行，忽然迷途了。</p>
<p>（二）一個過路人對他們説：小朋友！你倆跟我來，我領你們回去。</p>
<p>（三）林林和蓓蓓跟那人走了。</p>
<p>（四）走到海灘邊，那個人叫林林和蓓蓓上小艇。</p>
<h3>北極探險者（二）</h3>
<p>— 禧</p>
<p>他所搭的船是一艘很大的横帆雙桅船「進步」號，他所走的航路是直接通過大衛氏海峽。在經過格林蘭的丹麥殖民地時，他們又雇用了一個一半兒已受過教育的愛斯基摩青年，專管打獵的事情，另外又弄到了一隊狗，以作探險時拖着雪車走過冰地之用，那船駛到了倫番納海灣中就停住了。這所在是在史密斯海峽的西邊，在緯度七十九度和八十度之間，那日期不過是九月十日，可是冰塊已包圍攏來，使那船再也不能進行了。在十一月七日那天，陽光作最後一次的露面（在北極地方，半年是有太陽，而另一半年全是黑暗的，所以自七月起，天便漸漸的黑暗了。）從此就黑暗下來，一直要延長到一百四十一天之久。在這黑暗期間「連那些狗也感到苦痛的，因為它們慣常躺在艙門的下面，享受那一綫的光亮，而如今却什麽都瞧不見了。</p>
<p>在陽光隱没之先，甘恩博士即忙派人分頭出去，獵取各種的食物和其他應用的東西。他乘着這時冰塊還没有破碎，打算用雪軍出發，希望找到那通往北極盆地波里尼亞去的一條路，他以爲法蘭克林也許是被困在盆地的。到了春初的時候，陽光又回來了，當着第一道的光亮的天空中發現，他們重又繼續這搜尋的工作；在三月十八日那天，有一艘雪車裝着八個人，精神抖擻的出發了，在二十九日將近夜半時，甘恩博士和其他留守在船中的人們，正在暖和的船艙中就着燈光，縫補他們的軟皮鞋，忽地裏聽得上面來了一陣脚歩的聲音，一會兒就有三個人，臉面腫脹，疲乏不堪的走了下來，連一句話都説不出口。原來他們的伙伴中有四個人已凍僵在篷帳裏，不能行動，另外有一個勇敢的愛爾蘭人湯麥斯赫甘自願冒着生命的危險，留在那裏，侍候那四人的飲食，而他們三人却趕回來求助。只因一路上辛苦萬分，筋皮力盡，連説話都没有氣力了。</p>
<p>甘恩博士的第一個主意，當然是立刻出發去搭救他的伙伴們。於是架好了一輛雪車，帶了一個小小的篷帳和一些乾的肉餅，一切都預備好了；那三人中惟有烏爾生身體比較的硬朗一些，就用一張毛皮的袋將他包裹起來，他的兩條腿捲住在狗皮和鴨絨中，用皮帶把他縛住在雪車上，請他做一個嚮導人。那時連甘恩博士在內一共是九個人，在冰點以下七十八度的大寒天，向冰天雪地中毅然出發了。</p>
<h3>怎樣做健兒</h3>
<p>— 自立</p>
<p>兒童是國家未來的主人翁，要造成未來的强國，先要造成現在的健兒。</p>
<p>養育和發育是不同的，養育僅算是盡了人事，發育纔算是得到了效果。</p>
<p>樹木的根深了枝葉纔能茂盛，兒童的骨骼堅了發育才能健全，所以養育兒童第一要注意的事情，就是强健兒童的骨骼。</p>
<p>强健骨骼的要素，是鈣質和維他命丁，兒童發育的時期，需要很殷，假使没有額外的補充，就會發育不全，或變成軟骨蛀齒等等的病症</p>
<p>怎樣給兒童神充這兩種要素呢？現在有種「家樂鈣　巧克力糖，味道和普通的巧克力一樣，但是它裏面含有適量的　　和維他命了，兒　每次吃一二塊，一　吃幾次，就能使骨骼牙齒發育優良，身體壯健，造成未來强國的主人翁。（「家樂鈣」五洲藥房去買。）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>十四吋與十六吋</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>昨據倫敦報載，日本政府，到於一九三六年倫敦海軍條約所載，主艦砲位口徑“十四吋”，將拒絕不受，據海軍界人士宣稱，此項消息，卽令屬實，英國於最近三年內，亦不擬有所變更云云，這個反對，是因為十四吋口徑，還嫌不彀，主張十六吋口徑，方才快意，十四吋與十六吋，雖然祇有二吋，但其射擊力的增加，和破壞力的偉大，相差甚遠，不像布店裏賣布似的，買一尺還可以加二尺的便當，其關係海軍戰鬥方面，十分重要。</p>
<p>因此質的問題發生，便影響到量的問題，倫敦海軍條約所規定，主力艦不得過三萬五千噸，但三萬五千噸的主艦，只裝置十四吋口徑之大砲為宜，若裝十六吋口徑之大砲，非四萬五千噸不可，這樣一來，非但反對十四吋口徑，連三萬五千噸的主艦，亦且推翻，故泰晤時報評論謂，主力艦砲位口徑，若果由十四吋提高至十六吋，他日影響所反，必有一國以技術的理由為口實，而將主力艦噸位提高至三萬五千噸以上，因而海軍造艦競爭，亦將永無止境，這原是必然的趨勢，不必贅言。</p>
<p>其實簡單言之，一紙條約的空文，而欲限制各國軍備的競爭，其勢萬無可能之理，假定條約上儘管規定三萬五千噸的主艦，而事實上儘管造四萬五千噸，或竟造五萬五千噸的主艦，試問簽訂條約各國對之，有怎樣辦法呢？卽據最近一例，梵爾賽的和約，何等關係重要，而現在德國的軍備，又重整起來了，萊茵河畔又重揚他們國社黨的國旗了，試問對之有什麼辦法？</p>
<p>總之現在的世界，是一個武力的世界，是一個競爭軍備的世界，是一個無公理無人道的世界，所謂條約，所謂同盟，多是一種掩飾人耳目的工具，全然沒有用處，現在只有量自己的國力，製造精良的武器，只要你有能力，有人才，非但十六吋口徑，便是十八吋口徑或二十吋口徑，任你去造，那有敢來問你的信？所以報載，美國政府，現擬待適當時機，提出一種和平計劃，而以縮减軍備為主要之點，此說頃由羅斯福總統否認，因為美國最喜歡做和平妥協工作的，此種理想，羅斯福總統未始沒有，不過鑑於現在軍備競爭已到白熱度之際，此種繩理想的提案，適足為人所笑，以為非愚則迂，故只有以否認了之。</p>
<p>至於限制軍備與縮緘軍備，世界上本來沒有這回事，在一種黷武主義的國家，其武力固俞厚俞佳，决非他國可以干涉，亦决不肯受他國的干涉，卽其他無野心的國家，一個國家，自有一國的國策，自有一國必須的軍事整備，如何可加以限制，譬如從前我國古代的武器，有用大刀重八十二斤的，有用長槍重五十二斤的，祇要看各人的本領若何，氣力若何，决不能限制戰鬬者，我用多少斤的槍，你也祇能用多少斤的刀，此固為事實所不可能，而亦為形勢所不必者也。</p>
<h3>野步拾掇</h3>
<p>— 家怡</p>
<p>春郊</p>
<p>拖着我倦怠的情懷，我離開了這煩膩都市的一角而走入另一個的天地了。這不經意而獲得的奇蹟，宛加銀幕上一瞬間給我換了的情景。</p>
<p>那眼前是一片綠油油的麥苗，從黃色的泥上望去像一片深沈的大海了；而且，當凉意的春風拂過去時，葱叢的嫩葉偃柔得如綠水的微波，從遠遠的盪來，盪去；一浪又是一浪。</p>
<p>黃色的野花零亂地浮着。雖則牠沒有香的氣息，沒有誘人的麗色，然而在這綿綿一碧的田垅，也够給人以愉悅的點綴了。</p>
<p>盈盈的河塘，豐裕的積着宿雨後的春水，讓河邊的垂柳俯照牠們婀娜的輕身，新穿上綠點的春裝。對面的幾樹含葩的桃花少女似的含着滿口笑意，許以為楊柳太嫵媚了吧！然而何曾知道身後的落英要委寄於無情的流水呢！</p>
<p>在晴空落下些什麼的食糧喲！人家只見得枯憔的土地現在潛動着生命蓬勃的偉力來。這力量灌注在一切造物的血管，不可一世的青春將衝開了冬的餘威，新生的宇宙表現出幸福是快樂的。</p>
<p>我雖沒有看見燕子的輕飛，但在孩子手中牽着風箏春光是太撩人了。</p>
<p>姑娘</p>
<p>春光是太撩人了。撩撥着年輕姑娘的靈魂。她們在工作的田間，更鋤長了她們自己的苗芽，怠倦的工作終制不住</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>這滋長的春心。李心似楊花的隨着風兒飄颺，誰知道落在誰家的院落。</p>
<p>他們是三三兩兩地，伴着裹着頭包在生活中蒼老的婦人。勤勞而倦怠的母親，許已忘了孩子們心中的春光！她喊：</p>
<p>—快些看啊，一會兒落晚了。</p>
<p>姑娘們打了一個深深的懶勁，振起她們無力的兩臂，兩臂是麻鬆的要倒下了身子。</p>
<p>那幾個在河邊洗濯的，該照到她們桃色的面龐吧！當雙雙的游魚泳過她們的眼前時，這挑撥又是多麽的難堪！……但她們惟願父親明朝有一回好的生意，帶一雙入時鞋面回來…</p>
<p>從那高臺的烟囱日夜爬出吮吸了血液的黑蛇的那邊，嘯着慘慘的聲音。又另一羣向她們被放回來了：有的灰黄着臉色，有的却塗上城市間的浮華——警戒色的紅唇和粉臉。有的學會了女學生們的情歌，有的在駡怨她們雨後梨花的命運。</p>
<p>鄉下姑娘的青春先着未盡的春光蒼忘了！當披着淡燙的春裝的女學生們和她們的情人連袂面談笑走過她們的眼簾時。</p>
<p>荒塚</p>
<p>那些纍纍的是什麽？我没有别的想頭可撇開牠不是荒塚！</p>
<p>鏝頭似的土塊上，没有春的氣息在蒸發着。只見枯斷的草梗悽凉地絶命了！然而四周却綠的一片啊！這生與死的分野使我悲哀了！</p>
<p>在這兩個世界裏誰能說那是幸福的？剛走到荒塚前的一個老者，我看他以極大悲哀的眼光深深地佇看着墳上。這目語是多麽地沈痛。他挑着重重的担子終於又無力地走了。</p>
<p>這些荒塚裏的人和生着的後代一樣的和土地過了一世。他們（她們）犯辛勤種得的蔬菜，每晚挑得乾乾净，每早肩挑到城市裏去，（那時，城市的人正在着好夢！）而他們換得的代價却不能為他們的子女買一條鹹魚或一雙襪子！</p>
<p>祖先用憤怒的發洩吼過他們的孩子，用柳鞕抽着他們的畜牲；孩子的也照樣地在他們孩子的身上報復。工作戕害了他們人的春光，土地啃去了他們枯竭的血液。他們撇開兩手去時，遣下的仍是一塊磨滅生命的土地。</p>
<p>繼代的窮困，窮困的命運。荒塚的積聚在土地上更多了！土地是他們的生命之神，也是他們致命之魔。他們在人間的過程，只是在停下工作的夜晚，在棺似的小屋前翹望那天邊一角火一般的燈光，展開他們幻想的安慰！</p>
<p>老年人走近他們祖先的墳邊了但少年人却倔强地在滋長他們的青春，當土地上的怒吼沸騰時，荒塚裏的睡着人們會看見他們子孫是怎樣的一副歡笑的面孔啊！</p>
<h3>橋底記憶</h3>
<p>— 夏理斯</p>
<p>昨夜徘徊於寂聊的四川路橋，歸來我做着古怪的夢，彷彿我又回到迢遥的故鄉去了，我穿過那古樸的朱溪橋，就望得見我那久別的家門了。</p>
<p>像是淸晨，又似乎是黄昏，週遭是朦朧的。我這還鄉的遊子底眼睛也是朦朧的。可是，我生長於這鄉間，我就永世也忘不了這裏有豐肥的田野，綠的山岡，和那淙淙流着的溪水。我怎能不認得我那脫了漆的，古銅色的家門，和門上的紅紙春聯呢——門是没有閂上，一推便呀地一聲開了。</p>
<p>「誰呀？有蒼老而軟弱的聲音在問了。」</p>
<p>哦，這熟習的聲音不是老祖母底麽？迂迂拐了出來，呈着高年的慈和的臉的不是老祖母是誰呢？她盡力睜着老花的眼睛，往門外望……於是我底影子出現了；我明白看見她底身子一怔……我趕上前去用顫抖的呼喚對着她開口了，就扶住她走進家裏來。</p>
<p>「為什麽不先來一封信……我正在奇怪你為什麽好久沒有音信！你回來得多麽突然呼！哦，讓我算算看，三十一歲出門的，現在足足九個年頭了。多謝天！你已經是得那麽堅實和高大，正如你父親一樣……好，你坐在這裏，讓我來點燈。」一路這樣喃喃着，我們一道到了廳堂上。老祖母擦了一根洋火，但立刻給風吹熄了。於是又擦第二支，然後用極其抖悸的手點上了燈。在黃色火光之下，我悵望着老祖母；而我却被一種崇高的溫情所包圍着。老祖母終於微笑起來：「多謝天，你長得多麽好呀？</p>
<p>「姑姑呢？」我問了。因爲我感到寂寞。</p>
<p>「她上城裏看你表哥底病去了，今晚大約是不會回來的，你吃過晚飯沒有呢？我來給你燒一頓晚飯吧！」</p>
<p>祖母是太老了，我說，此刻很想去看看鄰家底慶叔叔，也許就在那裏吃吧</p>
<p>慶叔叔底家就在橋底另一邊，不費十分鐘的路就到了。用着同樣的震愕，這老實的中年人接待着我。而我却驚愕地在這裏遇見了慶叔叔底女兒阿蕙；不是說已經嫁了人，做了母親的麽？這美麗的童年的伴侶啊。</p>
<p>晚飯是在慶叔叔家裏吃了，怕時間巳是太遲，自己也實在有點疲倦，便辭别出來。一路有颯颯的山風，和田間的虫呌。天上的月色很淸澈；但是朱溪底水更清澈，當我扶着橋底欄杆向水上看的時候，我看見的是淙淙流着的水；流着，流着，使我想起童年時在這裏看見的水也是這樣地流着。</p>
<p>而我底童年是流水似地，不知道流到那裏去了！留下的是這橋上的記憶。</p>
<p>橋底記憶裏邊有着拖着兩條辮子的阿蕙的。我們年小的時候成天地在山岡上爬，在田陌間奔跑，在橋上看流水。當我們底年紀稍稍大了些懂得了一些人間底世故的時候，我有一次問她道：</p>
<p>「蕙，你想到了什麽？」</p>
<p>「我想到水不住地流，我們底童年也有一天會流盡的；那時我們怎樣呢？</p>
<p>我當時窘住了，没有答腔；而九年以後的現在，事實作了最殘酷的回答：阿蕙已經是人家底妻子，兩個孩子底母親，而我却是一個天涯漂泊的獨身漢。</p>
<p>這不可解的人生啊！</p>
<p>夢醒時，更殘酷地使我苦痛於我仍留在陌生的海上，連家鄉也不曾歸去過一次——我底漂泊生涯已經將近有十年了</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>好起勁校對兼外勤趙丹來「十字街頭」的演出</h3>
<p>老趙，是一個失了業的智識份子，他住在都的角落裏，簡單齷齪的寓所，還欠了二房東幾個月的房租，生活是窘困到無以可繼，找職業求生存的心是十分的急廹，每天都在外邊奔跑，但是在人浮於事的現在，出賣智力還畢竟不是一件容易的事。</p>
<p>結果，某一天的早晨，在郵差的手裏他接到了一封信，這封信裏給他帶來了一個好的消息。他有職業了，是一家報館裏做校對員，雖説酬報是那樣微薄，地位是那樣低劣，可是在他却是一個非常的機會，從此他的生活也許可以安定一點了，</p>
<p>他很高興的跑到報館去，工作雖然那樣忙廹，但他却只顧埋頭的做，一有空閒的時候，他還學習着寫稿子。在偶然的機會給主筆先生發現了他的寫作的才能，被派　兼特寫的外勤記者了。身兼兩職，真忙得喘不過氣來，但他還是拼命的幹，同事們的譏笑，他不理，他的回答是：</p>
<p>「死總不致于的，我想有事總比没事好些，有飯吃總比没飯吃好些……」</p>
<p>朋友！這是怎樣慘痛的話語，爲着「活，我們得幹，你自己又怎樣？一九三九劇社</p>
<h3>將排演「日出」</h3>
<p>劇本已蒙社會局通過</p>
<p>夏霞梅熹孫敬均參加</p>
<p>跟一九三七年戲劇年而誕生的新興劇社「一九三七」，他們已籌備很久了，本來是計劃將凌鶴先生的「黑地獄」搬上舞台，作第一次獻演的劇本，後來因為該劇二次未經通過，而暫時地它擱下來；一方面馬上又把曹禹先生的「日出」呈上檢查，同時在該劇的技術上努力地幹着。</p>
<p>到了前二天，不但劇本完全四幕通過，而且演員都是富有舞台天才的人担任了。如夏霞，梅熹，高歩霄，孫敬，曼娜……等，而且「日出」裏面小東西一角也已找得相當人才擔任，是舒繡紋的妹妹舒娜。</p>
<p>導演呢？第一當然是左明了；同時他們還需要更多的人來導演他們，在這樣豐富的人才隊伍中，劇塲將近又要轟轟烈烈地下一頴炸彈了！</p>
<h3>大光明映「可愛的野貓」</h3>
<p>小明星金蕙漱新偉搆</p>
<p>金蕙漱的演技，在好萊塢的小明星中，可以算得足最佳的一個，他以前的作品，都很受人歡迎，博得不少的讚美聲。現在，他的最新名作「可愛的野貓」The　IIoly　Teiror，又在大光明公映了，金蕙漱在該片中，飾一天真爛漫的頑皮小姐，在海軍部內，屢闖窮禍，把海軍大將鬧得頭昏，叫全班水手笑得牙痛！但是，最後她竟於無意中，揭破了間諜的陰謀，爲海軍部建一奇勳，內容亦莊亦諧，有歌有舞，真可以算得是金蕙漱的空前傑作云。</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin Goes to Hubei, Then Guangdong</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, he departed Beijing on the Yong Sui warship.  He will personally pay tribute to the martyrs of Huanghuagang.  Li Bai invited Lin to inspect Guangxi.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At 8:30 AM on the 20th, Chairman Lin boarded the Yong Sui warship at the Beijing Navy Wharf, heading to Hubei and then Guangdong via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to pay respects to the martyrs of Huanghuagang. Accompanying him were Chief Aide-de-Camp Lu of the National Government, staff members including Li You-shu, and approximately 200 senior officials from the three departments of the National Government – Civil Affairs, Military Affairs, and Accounting – as well as representatives from various Yuan (branches of government), ministries, and commissions, including President Dai, Wang Zhengting, Deng Jiayan, Li Wenfan, Ma Chaojun, Chen Shaokuan, Wei Huai, Gu Zhenglun, and Wang Gu-pan. All were present at the wharf to see him off. The capital's military police had increased patrols along the riverbanks. Both the National Government and the Navy sent bands to the wharf to play farewell music. The Chairman, accompanied by the two chiefs of staff, traveled by car from his residence to the wharf at 8:15 AM.  He disembarked amidst the music and boarded the ship to rest in his cabin, then went to greet the officials seeing him off. Each official boarded the ship in turn to pay their respects, and the Chairman shook hands with each of them before they returned to the wharf. At 8:30 AM, the Yong Sui warship weighed anchor and sailed upstream. Simultaneously, all ships anchored in the river raised flags and fired salutes in respect. The Chairman then appeared in the reception room and stood on the left side of the deck, frequently nodding his head to express his gratitude to the well-wishers until the ship had sailed into the center of the river. The well-wishers then departed for the city. It is understood that Chairman Lin is scheduled to arrive in Guangzhou on the 25th, so he does not plan to stop along the way. He will still take the Guangdong-Hankou Railway when he returns to Beijing. This is because He Jian telegraphed, welcoming the Chairman to visit Hunan and specially dispatched Xi Chulin from Beijing on the morning of the 20th to respectfully accompany the Chairman to Hunan. Therefore, the Chairman will make a short stop in Hunan on his return trip to Beijing. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>[Wuhu] Chairman Lin traveled to Hubei and then Guangdong by the Yong Sui warship. He passed Wuhu at 2:00 PM on the 20th going upstream. The Jian Kang warship stationed in Wuhu raised flags and fired salutes in respect. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Li Bai telegraphed Chairman Lin, welcoming him to Guangxi for inspection. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Huang Xuchu dispatched Wei Yunsong to Guangzhou on the 20th to welcome Chairman Lin and visit Zeng Yangfu. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Arches were built in prosperous areas of the province to welcome Lin. The headquarters of the Field Commander ordered the troops stationed along the Guangdong route to protect him along the way. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Zeng Yangfu and His Wife Hosted a Banquet for the British Ambassador</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen attended a banquet hosted by Zeng Yangfu and his wife on the evening of the 20th. More than 100 military and civilian officials, including Yu Hanmou and Luo Zhuoying, were in attendance. Knatchbull-Hugessen is scheduled to tour Conghua on the 21st and hold private meetings with various dignitaries on the morning of the 22nd. Knatchbull-Hugessen is extremely willing to invest in the development of Qiongyai, the completion of the Wengjiang Hydroelectric Power Plant, and the iron and steel plant by the British. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Mayor Zeng will host a banquet tonight to entertain British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and his wife. In his speech, he called on Britain to continue to assist China and cooperate with China in the national salvation and revival enterprise. Zeng said, China is now truly united, but the work of national salvation and revival is still far from success. Britain should continue its assistance and cooperation, because in this international crisis, Britain's close friendship with China is a matter of urgent necessity. Once China's national strength is restored, it will become a force for stability in the Far East and will greatly contribute to Britain's efforts to achieve world peace. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Military Attache Kita Goes to Tongzhou for Inspection</h3>
<p>Returning to Beiping at noon.  Attended a banquet given by Song.</p>
<p>[Beiping] Kita went to Tongzhou for inspection this morning and returned to Beiping at noon. He attended a banquet hosted by Song, where they continued to talk earnestly for more than three hours before he left. Kita will go to Tianjin on the 21st to meet with Tadashi, where he will have discussions. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Zhangjiakou, Omoto, along with the Japanese military attachés stationed in Tianjin, Matsudaira and Nakamura, came to Beiping this afternoon to visit Kita and report on matters. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Zhangjia Will Go to Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia and Xuanhua's Six Banners</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Zhangjia is scheduled to go to the Six Banners of Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia and Xuanhua this month. The trip is scheduled to last one month, after which he will return to Mount Wutai. In addition to reporting to Yan by telegram, Zhang also telegraphed Xu Yongchang, asking him to consult with Chiang nearby and ask for instructions. He will determine the travel date after receiving a reply. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Hosts a Banquet for the Guangxi Inspection Group</h3>
<p>[Taiyuan] The Guangxi Inspection Group, led by Zhang Renmin, visited various military and government officials this morning. At noon, they visited Yan at the Suiyuan Headquarters to report on the actual situation of their visits and to discuss the construction of Shanxi and Guangxi. Yan hosted a banquet at the Suiyuan Headquarters in the evening and plans to have various military and government agencies in Shanxi send personnel to form a Guangxi Inspection Group. He has ordered the competent authorities to draft a plan. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong-Hankou Wireless Telephone Officially in Operation</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou] The Guangdong-Hankou wireless telephone, prepared separately by the Guangdong City Telephone Administration Office and the Hubei Electrical Affairs Administration Bureau, officially opened on the 20th.

<h3>Last Words</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou] Huang Musong's last words were: I have been studying and serving as an official for more than 40 years. I have no great learning or career to repay the country. I am deeply ashamed. Last year, I was ordered to preside over Guangdong. I was not capable of it, but because of the heavy trust placed in me by the central government and the earnest expectations of the elders, I dared not refuse to take on the task. I originally planned to fulfill my long-cherished ambitions and do something to make the unified Guangdong follow the right track and seek progress. Unfortunately, after returning to Guangdong for several months, I was troubled by illness in the middle. After a slight improvement, I was invaded by new illnesses, which became heavier day by day. According to my own estimation, I am afraid that I will not recover. It is a pity for me personally, but I am deeply burdened by the central government's trust and the earnest expectations of my elders and brothers in Guangdong, and I am uneasy. Fortunately, the whole country has been unified. Under the leadership of the wise leader Chairman Chiang, and with the care of Director Yu for the local area, I believe that the successor will be able to uphold this spirit and take on greater responsibilities for the benefit of Guangdong. Then I will have no regrets even in death. The gentlemen who are currently at my sickbed are all my dearest or have followed me for decades. Now, when I am about to die, I may as well briefly tell you about my life. The purpose I have always held is to restrain myself with integrity and encourage a clean life, and to seek progress with peace in dealing with things. Therefore, I have no great achievements in my life, nor any great mistakes. As far as the current political situation in our country is concerned, we should strive for practical unified production and construction as the only way out for saving the country. I returned to Guangdong this time with this in mind. My ambition was not fulfilled, and my life is over. What else can I say? I am of meager virtue and talent, and I am not worthy of being learned from, but I hope that you will encourage each other with this heart and this ambition, and serve the country. Then the day of my death will be the year of my life, and I will always be connected with you in spirit. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>

The total value of the goods will exceed US$300,000 pounds. The "2-8-2" type locomotives have been tested in various locations and have been found to be satisfactory, and are particularly suitable for China. In addition, the Huai River Dredging Bureau is also purchasing a large quantity of materials. It is reported that the agency is proceeding smoothly with everything.

<h3>Recent News on Bandit Suppression on the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Border</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Fang Buzhou's Wife Captured, Anfu County Magistrate Dies in Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: Liu Xing, the director of bandit suppression in the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border area, has long divided the bandit areas bordering western Jiangxi, northern Jiangxi, eastern Hunan, and southern Hubei into five major bandit suppression zones, each with a commander responsible for active suppression. The county magistrates also supervised local defense forces and the baojia system to handle the aftermath. According to reports from Pingxiang, ㊀ the first bandit suppression unit, Zhu's division, killed more than 30 bandits in Shuangkeng, and the remaining bandits fled to Huangjindong, bordering Xiuwu, Pingxiang, and Liuyang. ㊁ The political training sub-unit of the second bandit suppression zone has been effective in recruiting the pseudo-district committee of Xiu Shui County. ㊂ The third bandit suppression unit, Wu's division, engaged in a battle with Fang Buzhou, the bandit leader of the three-province border area, on the 2nd in a place 10 li north of Taipingtang, killing hundreds of bandits. Fang's wife was captured alive, and more than 80 bandits were captured, along with more than 100 guns. ㊃ The fourth bandit suppression zone has already defeated the pseudo-guerrilla battalion of Fenshuiba. At the same time, County Magistrate Yu of Tongshan cracked a bandit organization and obtained the pseudo-Northwest District's operational plan for February and March of the 26th year of the Republic, as well as other important documents. In all bandit areas bordering various counties, the political training sub-units and model guerrilla teams are using reformed elements to dismantle the lower-level organizations of the bandits and the secret organizations of the bandits in various places, cutting off their lifelines.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhu Mengzhen, the magistrate of Anfu County, recently led national troops to search for bandits in the countryside. Local bandits took advantage of the small number of local defense force troops and surrounded them on all sides. County Magistrate Zhu led his troops in a desperate battle, but was outnumbered and died a heroic death. After receiving the news, the provincial government expressed great sorrow and has appointed Cao to be the county magistrate to handle the aftermath.</p>
<h3>De Wang's Ambition ㊀</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Qian Hua</p>
<p>Wants to Use Foreign Force to Become Genghis Khan, A Mongolian Scholar with Genius</p>
<p>The former Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee was located in Bailingmiao. The office was a very large Mongolian yurt, lavishly decorated inside. It could accommodate more than 200 people for major conferences each year and was divided into many small rooms. The conference hall was carpeted with thick rugs and equipped with new-style stoves, no different from Western-style buildings. Many Mongolian princes and dukes frequented the place, and Secretary-General De Wang was even more of a regular visitor. Bailingmiao has always been a religious area and a major trading center for Mongolians and Han Chinese. Since the establishment of the Mongolian Political Council, it has become the political center of Inner Mongolia. With the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, it has also become the base of operations for bandit and puppet troops. Its strategic importance has truly increased day by day.</p>
<p>In the past, any Chinese and foreign travelers or other groups who visited Bailingmiao would definitely pay a visit to De Wang, the new-style leader of Inner Mongolia and Secretary-General of the Mongolian Political Council. The impression they got was unanimously good. Now, this De Wang is a puppet leader issuing orders for the bandit and puppet troops, and the puppeteer behind the scenes is the certain party pointed to by the world. Based on that consistent Manchu-Mongolian policy, the certain party shouted the slogan that Inner Mongolia is the first line of defense for the empire, and after decades of operation and arrangement, incited and provoked, causing internal division and collapse, in order to reap the benefits of a fisherman. This is also a matter of course and nothing to be surprised about. But why is the intelligent De Wang willing to be manipulated and used by a certain party? This is indeed a question worth studying, and it is also a key to solving the Inner Mongolia problem. The so-called know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle. When I was in Bailingmiao, I investigated this matter and interviewed many people who used to be close to De Wang. I also collected a lot of materials in Suiyuan, Zhangjiakou, and Beiping. Now I summarize it as follows.</p>
<p>㊀ Does Not Understand Japanese</p>
<p>De Wang's full name is Demchugdongrub, and he is 36 years old. He was born in Sunit Right Banner (also known as West Sunit Banner) in Xilingol League, Chahar. It was not until the 34th year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty that he inherited the title of Zasag Prince of Sunit Right Banner. When he was stationed in Zhangjiakou in the first year of the Republic of China, he was given the title of Prince. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, he officially took over the Zasag Seal. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Duan Qirui convened a post-war conference in Beiping, and De Wang represented the three leagues of Xilingol, Ulanqab, and Ih Ju and attended the conference. He was appointed as a Senator of the Provisional Senate. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, he was promoted to Deputy League Leader of Xilingol League. In the nineteenth year, he served as a member of the Chahar Provincial Government. In the twenty-second year, the Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee was established, and he served as a member and Secretary-General. In the twenty-third year, the Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee of various leagues and banners in Chahar Province was established, and he served as chairman. De Wang studied at the Mongolian-Tibetan School in Suiyuan and Beiping in his early years, and had a solid foundation in Chinese. He spoke fluent Beiping dialect. Later, he hired an American teacher in his palace to study English and the political, economic, and military knowledge of European and American countries, and he was quite clear about the general international situation.</p>
<p>His English level was barely enough to deal with British and American people, but he was very hardworking, subscribing to many Chinese and foreign newspapers and concerned about the evolution of world affairs. Among many Mongolian princes and dukes, his thinking and knowledge were indeed the most novel. Because of the relationship between the bandit and puppet troops and a certain party this time, many people say that he is a Japanese student. In fact, he doesn't speak Japanese at all. Recently, many Japanese soldiers came to the palace to visit him, and they were all translated by Major General Nagashima, the head of the special service agency. From the perspective of his personal historical process, he is more inclined towards Europe and the United States. His footprints have never set foot on the islands of Japan except for the three northeastern provinces and northern China. His dealings with the Japanese have only been in recent years. It is too imaginative to say that he is a Japanese student who speaks Japanese. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Fundamental Problems of China's Economic Construction</h3>
<p>— Lian Shisheng</p>
<p>The reason why England has dominated the world for three hundred years is because she is an advanced industrial country. The reason why the United States and Japan have dominated the East and West Oceans after the war is because their productivity has made amazing progress. The reason why the Soviet Union has been so influential in recent years is because her two five-year plans have been successfully completed one after another. Living in today's highly competitive world, a country without active economic construction as a backing cannot only fail to make the masses live and work in peace and contentment, but also cannot resist foreign aggression and seek survival. Therefore, our current task must be to urge the government to formulate a rationalized economic construction plan on the one hand, and to encourage the masses to embrace the determination to work hard and implement the plan on the other hand, so that we can overcome difficulties and achieve the goal of rejuvenation.</p>
<p>In fact, the government has long known the importance of China's economic construction, and has been consciously undertaking some work in recent years - the most obvious is the repair of roads. These achievements are indeed commendable, but from the perspective of economic construction itself, we still have many things that need to be supplemented urgently. I believe that if China's economic construction is to succeed in the near future, we must awaken the public's attention: to awaken the public's attention, there must first be practical achievements; to have practical achievements, we must start with the following fundamental problems.</p>
<p>What are these fundamental problems?</p>
<p>First, capital must be concentrated. The trend of modern industry is large-scale production, and large-scale production is based on large-scale organization. However, this production method and organization method can only be hoped to succeed in large companies and state-owned enterprises with strong capital, and the meager abilities of a few people are really out of the question. The benefits of large-scale production are: producers can obtain cheap raw materials, reduce unnecessary handling fees and office expenses, and make full use of the capabilities of factories and workers. As a result, costs are reduced, prices are lower, and markets can be monopolized everywhere. The reason why the modern Japanese cotton industry was able to defeat the British is mainly because it merged many cotton factories across the country into 71 companies, increasing the total capital to more than 500 million yen. Among them, the paid-up capital of companies such as the Toyo Cotton Company is as high as 55 million yen. With such strong capital, factory owners have the ability to build the most suitable factories, hire the most capable experts, and equip the most modern machines, which also helps them to be well-informed and efficient, and of course, manipulating the market is as easy as flipping their hand.</p>
<p>In principle, I believe that no one would object to concentrating capital. However, China is a poor country. Where can we get so much capital for the government to carry out economic construction step by step? I think that in addition to the method of public sales of matches and cigarettes mentioned by Mr. Chen Gongbo in his four-year industrial plan, two other methods can be adopted for the preparation of capital. One method is to reduce expenditure. There are really too many agencies in the central government now. Some things that can be handled by one agency are handled by several agencies separately, resulting in many increased expenses. Just in terms of economic construction, it is enough for the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways to jointly handle this matter, but in recent years, in addition to establishing an Economic Commission, we have also established the National Economic Movement Committee, the National Economic Planning Committee, and other agencies. With more agencies, expenditures will naturally increase, and the laxity of organization is even more of a concern. If the central government can merge these agencies into a National Economic Construction Committee, it can save a large expense every year. Also, most of China's military expenditure is used for food and salaries, and military equipment is not given much attention. These soldiers who are not enough to resist the enemy and are more than enough to cause trouble should be largely eliminated, and the expenditure on food and salaries should be saved to purchase munitions and supplement economic construction funds. Another method is to use foreign capital. After 1923, Japan's economic construction was maintained by loans from Britain and the United States. When the Soviet Union's first five-year plan was just implemented in 1928, it also had the help of foreign talents. Now that the central government intends to engage in construction, it may as well sincerely propose methods and conditions for cooperation to our true allies. If this road is successful, we don't have to worry about the source of our capital.</p>
<p>Second, we must adapt to the times. The lack of capital is a major obstacle to China's economic construction, so we must base our allocation of funds on reliable statistical surveys, and then plan which undertakings to handle first, which to handle later, which to handle more, and which to handle less. Otherwise, if the pace is disrupted and the measures are inappropriate, we will not see the achievements of construction, and our limited capital will have been used up. It will be ten times more difficult to raise capital and start over in the future than it is today. I believe that China's current economic construction must strictly adhere to the principle of regional division of labor. The central government should coordinate the overall situation, issue instructions, and the local governments should make full use of the most abundant special products and specialize in developing one or two industries, such as rice in the Yangtze River Basin, cotton in North China, leather goods in the Northwest, aquatic products in the coastal provinces, silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, porcelain in Jiangxi, medicinal materials in Yunnan and Sichuan, lacquer in Fujian, and fruits and plants in Guangdong. If we guide them according to their strengths, the results will definitely be more impressive than learning from Handan and abandoning ourselves to follow others. In recent years, those who talk about economic construction in the country mostly focus on developing transportation and heavy industry. These are certainly important, but in reality, the cost of heavy industry is too high, and we are really unable to do it for the time being. At the same time, transportation is just a tool. The most important thing is that we need to produce more things to use this tool. Otherwise, if our productivity is always lagging behind, then the development of transportation tools will only increase the convenience of smuggling for the enemy. Why bother to spend so much effort to serve the enemy exclusively.</p>
<p>Third, we must be practical and not superficial. The common fault of most people is that they love to show off and are not practical, and people engaged in economic construction are no exception. People say to prosper cities, and we also want to prosper cities, and the way to prosper is not to spend tens of millions of dollars to build dozens of tall Western-style buildings to serve as a façade, but to spend millions of dollars to repair antiques to decorate a scene of prosperity. Officials enjoy themselves, managers embezzle, and the masses not only cannot taste a bit of the taste of construction, but also increase countless burdens out of thin air because of construction. It is difficult for such construction to gain the sympathy of the masses. I think that the fundamental problem of China's economic construction is not the lack of plans, but too many plans; not the inability to start, but the inability to persist. No matter who comes to power, they will come up with a grandiose plan. Once there is a plan, they will not ask whether the economic source is reliable, whether a certain undertaking can be successfully carried out, and they will rush to carry it out, and even only have plans and agencies, and are not willing to seriously undertake one or two undertakings. The way to remedy this in the future must be to make rationalized plans based on possible economic sources. After the plans have been reviewed and announced, they must be implemented with all efforts, and it is best to be able to implement them successfully within the scheduled period, just like the Soviet Union's five-year plan being completed in four years. In the event that the incumbent official is relieved of his duties for some reason, the successor must be good at understanding the will of the predecessors, prioritize the future of the country, not lightly change the plan, not set up too many agencies, and not casually advance or retreat personnel, with the overall goal of completing the unfinished plan in a timely manner so that it will not be abandoned halfway. Only in this way can we get practical results, awaken the public's attention, and gain the public's support.</p>
<p>Now the call for economic construction has spread throughout the country. I sincerely hope that those who are directly responsible can prepare sufficient capital, develop the existing industries in the locality, be less ostentatious, work more, and if we do this for ten years, China will definitely have hope of rejuvenation. At that time, all the great disasters of the country can be solved easily.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Sato Declares to the House of Representatives That He Will Immediately Commence Concrete Negotiations with Various Countries</h3>
<p>His Previous Speech Was Merely a Supplement and Not a Correction; His Determination in Handling Affairs Hereafter Will Be No Less Than That of the Military</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee deliberating on the supplementary budget proposal for the twelfth year convened at 10:30 AM. Seiyukai member Masayoshi Motomura requested Navy Minister Yonai to provide a detailed explanation, without recording, of the Japanese Navy's attitude towards the Chengdu and Beihai incidents. Subsequently, Minseito member Tetsuo Kudo questioned Foreign Minister Sato's new diplomatic policy, which the public is closely watching. He noted that the opinions expressed by Sato in both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives have been repeatedly corrected, which may cause confusion. He asked why it was necessary to supplement the opinions expressed in the House of Representatives in the House of Peers, and requested an explanation.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Sato replied that there was no need to correct his speeches in either House, and that he did not believe there was anything that needed correcting. However, the meaning of "supplement" was not to overturn previous statements. He offered the same explanation in the House of Peers. He stated that he will immediately commence concrete negotiations with various countries and hopes that preparatory steps will facilitate progress.</p>
<p>Kudo asked that, in this era of expanding military strength, the Foreign Minister should exert utmost calm and recruit talent from all sectors into the diplomatic arena to rejuvenate diplomacy. He asked if Sato had such determination.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied that he believed all previous foreign ministers had such determination. In today's critical situation, this determination is even more necessary, needless to say. The current cabinet should be in complete agreement with diplomacy, and the military should be integrated with it, mutually supporting each other, which goes without saying. The military stationed abroad handles affairs with extraordinary determination, and this enthusiastic spirit is truly admirable. He feels that he must also handle affairs with a determination no less than that of the military, especially in light of the development of Japanese commercial rights. He keenly feels the necessity of such determination. Although his strength is limited, he will pay full attention to the reform of institutions and the recruitment of talent, and will strive to promote suitable individuals.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied that he is currently studying the reform of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and personnel matters with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Next, Seiyukai member Saburo Yatsukado asked whether the Foreign Minister believes today's Japanese budget is expanding military strength, and asked for an explanation of the "crisis" language used since the Manchurian Incident. He also asked whether "patience" should be exercised even when both sides refuse to concede, and whether there is an intention to create an exclusionary group when the time is right. He asked the Foreign Minister about the fundamental principles of diplomatic policy. The Foreign Minister replied that he only addressed the question of determination in response to Kudo's question. Regarding the diplomatic crisis, it can be understood by reading the records of the time. The so-called "patience" is based on international justice, and there is no need to despair if negotiations stall. If the other party adopts an attitude that violates international justice, they should be responsible. As for the so-called exclusionary group, he believes it is not yet the time. The fundamental principles of diplomatic policy were decided before he took office, and he will formulate policies accordingly.</p>
<p>Yatsukado reiterated his request for an explanation. The Foreign Minister replied that he also feels that strengthening national defense is extremely necessary. Today's national defense budget is the minimum necessary to strengthen national defense and should not provoke other countries.</p>
<p>Tadahiko Ikezaki asked about the Foreign Minister's statement in the House of Representatives Red Ink Committee that extreme nationalistic thought leads to narrow-minded patriotism. He asked what this meant and whether the principle of economic reciprocity contradicts the fundamental principles towards China.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied that his remarks about nationalistic thought were originally directed at the words and attitudes of foreign residents in Japan. He added that the principle of reciprocity is a basic element of diplomatic policy towards China.</p>
<p>Yoshinuma Yutani of the Toho-kai asked about the Foreign Minister's speeches and their potential impact on foreign countries.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied that it should not have a negative impact on foreign countries in general.</p>
<p>Yutani asked that, for example, Chinese media organs are taking an aggressive attitude toward Japan, in his opinion. The Foreign Minister stated that he believes improving international public opinion is a fundamental task to be undertaken before engaging in various negotiations, with the aim of harmonizing the feelings of the other party.</p>
<p>There was a recess at 1:15 PM, and the meeting reconvened at 2:25 PM. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM. (Twentieth-day Allied Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Situation of Japanese Nationals Selling Narcotics in Our Country</h3>
<p>British Newspaper Publishes Commentary</p>
<p>[London] The Manchester Guardian recently published an article on the Chinese narcotics problem, stating in brief: "The center of opium and its derivatives production is currently in Shenyang and other Manchurian cities, eastern Hebei, and the Japanese concessions in Tianjin. All kinds of narcotics are sold in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, and the prices are low and the supply is extremely convenient. Although Chinese authorities strictly prohibit opium within their own jurisdiction and even punish drug traffickers with death, it is impossible to prohibit this within the areas under Japanese influence. Moreover, Japanese merchants who sell and smuggle drugs travel throughout China, even in provinces currently governed by the Nanjing government. It is alarming that poor Chinese people, regardless of age, are tempted, knowingly or unknowingly, and often become addicted to drugs." (Twentieth-day Central News Agency dispatch from Le Havre)</p>
<h3>Japan to Establish Aircraft Manufacturing Company</h3>
<p>Capital of 30 Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japan's massive military budget, totaling 1.4 billion yuan, includes 300 million yuan for the development of the army, navy, and air force. The Ministry of Communications has also allocated over 10 million yuan to promote civil aviation. Therefore, a large aircraft manufacturing company will soon be established here. Aircraft manufacturing is the most important sector of Japan's military industry, and until now has been controlled by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Nakajima Aircraft Factory. However, according to information received today, Japan's largest aircraft company is being founded by Tamaki Makino, Jukuro Kadono, Masatsune Ogura, and Toranosuke Furukawa, centered around Mitsui, Sumitomo, Furukawa, and Okura, to compete with the two companies mentioned above. The new company's capital is expected to be 30 million yuan, and the factory will be located in the suburbs of Tokyo. Japan's aircraft manufacturing industry lags behind the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union in terms of technology and production capacity (it is expected that there will be considerable progress in the future).

<h3>Quezon to Hold Initial Negotiations with US Authorities</h3>
<p>Discussion of Committee Procedures; President of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce Supports Quezon</p>
<p>[Washington] Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles announced today that the US-Philippines Joint Committee will be formed within ten days, and then begin studying revisions to the Philippine Independence Act. US commissioners will be selected by committees from various departments, while the Philippine side will be appointed by President Quezon. As for the procedures, Quezon will continue discussions with US State Department officials. Both the US and Philippine Congresses will take action after the committee submits its report, but are also free to take action earlier. It is understood that responsible members of Congress have indicated a willingness to follow President Roosevelt's recommendations. (Nineteenth-day National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[New York] Philippine President Quezon declared here today that the US government committees have not yet accepted his suggestion to grant the Philippines independence before 1946. However, it has clearly indicated that it will be open to discussion once the special committee has submitted its report. A professor at the Columbia University School of Journalism hosted a banquet for President Quezon today. During the banquet, Quezon spoke about the reasons why Filipinos are demanding independence, and spoke to student groups about the Philippine Constitution, saying that it is based on the US Constitution, but was drafted by enlightened people who understood current changes, and is therefore superior to the original. The Philippine Constitution contains the life philosophy of the Philippine people's collective life. He stated that what the US President is now advocating for are judicial reform and limiting the power of Congress to decide on budgetary matters, which the Philippine Constitution has already taken into account. Although the United States is rich, it is still insufficient; although the Philippines is poor, it has a surplus. Quezon will stay here this weekend and is scheduled to return to Washington next Monday to discuss the selection of special committee members with Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles. US High Commissioner to the Philippines Paul McNutt will visit Quezon in Washington, and Quezon will reciprocate the following day. (Nineteenth-day National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Manila] President Aquinado of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce telegraphed US President Roosevelt today, supporting Philippine President Quezon's suggestion for early Philippine independence. He requested that President Roosevelt take action in Congress as soon as possible to achieve immediate Philippine independence. Aquinado is also the leader of the Philippine minority party.

<h3>A Brief History of Naval Negotiations After the War</h3>
<p>French Publish Report</p>
<p>[Paris] The Naval Committee of the Chamber of Deputies has recently published a report outlining a brief history of naval negotiations since the Great War, and commenting on the new naval situation resulting from last year's London Naval Treaty (concluded by the UK, France, and the US). It states that "the Washington Naval Treaty only recognized the UK, the US, and Japan as major naval powers, dividing naval control among them, and completely ignored France's need to protect its colonies. Last year's London Naval Treaty finally recognized France's need, and since then, the autocratic ranking system in the naval field has ceased to exist. The provision that each signatory must notify each other of naval shipbuilding procedures has greatly facilitated the cause of spiritual disarmament. All of this is the greatest achievement of last year's London Naval Treaty." The report also states that last year's London Naval Treaty demonstrates the rapprochement between the three major democracies of the UK, France, and the US, but it is regrettable that Japan and Italy have not yet signed on to the treaty.

<h3>Elementary School Explosion Tragedy in the US Claims Over 600 Lives</h3>
<p>Over 400 Bodies Recovered; Cause Determined to Be Gas Explosion</p>
<p>⊙Austin Gas explosion expert Dr. Askey is currently investigating the New London school explosion tragedy. According to the investigation, the school walls were full of gas, and the tragedy was caused by a gas explosion. After carefully examining the six gas radiators that remained intact after the explosion, he discovered that only one had a good ventilation hole. The bodies of the deceased children show that they were killed by the explosion, not by fire. (Twentieth-day Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙New London After searching the elementary school building that was tragically destroyed on Wednesday, a total of 425 teachers and students' bodies have been found. The death toll is estimated at about 620. A six-member investigation team has begun to investigate to determine the cause of the explosion. According to initial reports, the tragedy was caused by the accumulation of gas in the boiler room. The investigation team will now summon witnesses and survivors to testify. At the same time, the Washington Mining Department has sent four experts to investigate, and the Texas State House of Representatives has passed a proposal to investigate the matter. As workers cleared the rubble, they found a blackboard with the words "East Texas' oil and natural gas are the greatest mineral welfare. Without them, this school could not have been established here, and we all could not be here to study." (Twentieth-day Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙New London Yesterday's unprecedented tragedy at the elementary school due to a boiler explosion has resulted in the excavation of the remains of the victims in the wreckage of the school, which was finally completed this afternoon. According to a report from Colonel Burke, the commander of the militia assisting in the excavation, a total of 425 bodies have been recovered, including 17 confirmed teacher bodies, most of whom have severed limbs and are too horrible to look at. However, it is possible that other bodies will be discovered later. According to the authorities, there are more than 40 teachers and more than 700 students in the school, indicating that more than half of the victims are dead. Texas Governor Allred has mobilized the militia to rush to the scene of the accident to provide relief. The American Red Cross has also been ordered by President Roosevelt to immediately send personnel to rescue. All oil mines in the town stopped working during the accident, and the rain today added to the misery. Many parents of students, unable to find their children, are unwilling to leave the scene of the accident. Nearby hospitals, schools, and churches are full of injured and corpses, many of which have not yet been identified. Yesterday's water explosion occurred at 2:20 PM, only a few minutes before the students were dismissed. As for the cause of the explosion, the reports vary. The Texas State Assembly has passed a resolution calling for an investigation to clarify the truth. (Nineteenth-day Central News Agency dispatch from Le Havre)</p>
<p>⊙New London The exact number of teachers and students killed in the boiler explosion tragedy at the town's elementary school is still unclear at this time. However, it can be asserted that at least 200 of the bodies recovered are still unknown by their real names. The leader of the rescue team, Raleigh, who is also a detective, recently declared that he had served in France during the European War in the Argonne region, witnessing the horrors of war firsthand. This tragedy is different from the war, but it is enough to make those who see it sad and those who hear it grieve, even more so. (Twentieth-day Central News Agency dispatch from Le Havre)</p>

<p>[Washington] The House Ways and Means Committee today released a recent letter from Secretary of State Hull, containing a warning that if European countries do not rein in their plans to expand armaments, they will inevitably invite military and economic looting. If European countries gradually eliminate trade barriers, the stability of exchange rates and the cessation of armaments can be easily resolved. The letter states that the situation in the Far East has not been stable throughout the year, and the protection of American citizens in China has been a constant concern for the State Department, sometimes causing serious concern. The US government is concerned about the lives and property of American citizens, as well as the peace and welfare of the countries in the Far East, causing it to pay close attention to any developments in that region. The House Ways and Means Committee today passed the regular expenses of the State Department, the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Labor, totaling $121,223,000.

<p>[Washington] The House Appropriations Committee met today, and Secretary of State Hull elaborated on the issue of neutrality, stating in brief: "When war breaks out in the future, the United States cannot use its neutrality policy as a shield. The policy we pursue to protect the rights of neutral countries has the danger of dragging our country into the vortex of war. This danger must be eliminated with great effort, but this does not mean abandoning all the rights of neutral countries. If we do this, the belligerent countries will treat us as servants. What the American people should keep in mind is that the neutrality law is not a reliable guarantee that our country will never be involved in the vortex of war." Hull also addressed the world economic problem, stating in brief that the trend of developing international trade is becoming increasingly clear. "Otherwise, the great economic disasters that may occur cannot be avoided." Finally, Hull advocated for the establishment of commercial treaties with various countries based on the principle of reciprocity, as only then can we discuss other issues with various countries, such as the issue of arms "truce."

<p>[Washington] Regarding President Roosevelt's plan to convene a world economic conference in the near future, with a capital city of a Scandinavian country as the venue, Secretary of State Hull revealed the news at the House Appropriations Committee today, saying that he had earnestly advised the authorities of a certain European country to take action in reference to the Pan-American Peace Conference, and told them, "The economic situation is so unsound, and the political situation is so extremely chaotic, how can you be content with sighs and lamentations? Why not think of what the Pan-American Peace Conference is doing?" Responsible people here believe that since President Roosevelt has spoken of convening a world economic conference, and Hull has issued such a declaration, they are paying extreme attention to it.

<p>⊙Madrid Government forces on the Guadalajara front in the northeast of the capital have recovered the town of Brihuega and found a telegram from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in the town, which has been officially handed over to the newspapers for publication. The contents briefly state: "I am now aboard the cruiser 'Pola' bound for Libya in North Africa. I have just received a report on the situation on the Guadalajara front and believe that our troops will be able to bravely recover the enemy troops and defeat the international team. I am closely watching the brave actions of our troops. May all my soldiers know this."

In addition, after conquering Brihuega, the government forces seized a flag of the Nationalist army, which has been brought here for reporters to view.

Our comrades who were captured by the government army recently broadcast on the radio, which we heard and were very moved. We decided to give up fighting, and because the officers were watching us very closely during the day, we surrendered to the government army at night when it was dark." According to unconfirmed news, the number of Nationalist soldiers surrendering to the government army has reached thousands in recent days. In addition, General Miaja, chairman of the National Defense Committee, recently declared when meeting with reporters that the government forces in the Guadalajara area are continuing to advance, and the rebels have fled north.

<h3>Taiwanese Arrested in Zhangzhou for Smuggling Arms</h3>
<p>Smuggling Arms Is Actually Sheltered by the Baozhang; Cai, Zeng, and Qiu Have All Been Captured</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Guo Tianfeng, a platoon leader of the 157th Division stationed in Songyu, Haicheng County, across from Xiamen, was ordered to lead a team together with District Chief Lin Xiaomu to Zhongshanwei Township at 2:00 a.m. on the 12th to surround and search the residence of Baozhang Cai Jun. Cai Jun, Zeng Hongxi, and Qiu Jian were captured and sent to the Zhangzhou Division Headquarters for investigation on the same day. It is reported that Zeng Hongxi and Qiu Jian usually travel between Taiwan, Xiamen, and the coastal areas, specializing in smuggling arms and private goods. Their influence extends throughout the coastal areas of southern Fujian. Last month, a large batch of private goods was transported to Kinmen and seized by the county's security team. The remaining accomplices fled to Hui'an County and smuggled 10,000 taels of opium into Zhangzhou, all related to Zeng Hongxi. This time, Zeng and Qiu were arrested because they secretly transported hundreds of long and short guns from Taiwan last month and unloaded them in Xin'an Village, hiding them at the home of villager Qiu Lian, who then transported them inland. Baozhang Cai Jun actually provided shelter, which was discovered by the division headquarters. Therefore, Cai, Zeng, and Qiu were arrested and investigated on suspicion of smuggling arms. After this incident, Zeng's mother, Zeng Wang, published a notice in the newspaper stating that her son was a legitimate businessman from Xiamen who went to Zhongshanwei Village to ask Cai Jun to help purchase brown sugar for sale in Xiamen. He was falsely accused and had no involvement in smuggling arms. She had already submitted a plea to the Zhangzhou Division Headquarters. As of the 15th, the Japanese newspaper in this city acknowledged that Zeng Hongxi was Taiwanese who traveled between Xiamen and Haicheng to sell groceries and purchase local sugar, but was detained due to malicious false accusations. This case is currently under investigation by the Zhangzhou Division Headquarters. According to reports, a large number of Taiwanese have privately entered the mainland in recent years, especially in Quanzhou. A recent investigation shows that there are also hundreds of people in Zhangzhou, but the reported ancestral homes are all counties in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. In fact, the ancestors of Taiwanese people originally migrated from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. Taiwan was only transferred to Japan 40 years ago. Those who return to Zhangzhou and Quanzhou naturally have their ancestral homes, relatives, and clans there. It is extremely difficult to identify them unless they admit to being Taiwanese. However, whenever there is a criminal incident, their status as residents is revealed. For example, when Zeng Hongxi committed a crime, he immediately claimed to be Taiwanese. (March 17th)</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong's Troops Fully Enter Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Transportation Trains Are Fully Arranged; Depart from Xi'an and Xianyang; Housing Demand in Bengbu Exceeds Supply</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Yu Xuezhong's troops are moving to Anhui and have been gradually moving eastward from Gansu. They will be concentrated in Xianyang for train transport. The railway transport plan for the Gansu Pacification Commissioner's Office and its subordinate units has been formulated. The number of trains required by each unit, the start date of transport, the route, the train commander, and the disembarkation location have also been fully arranged, compiled into a table, and submitted to each unit for reference. It is learned that starting from the 26th of this month, transport will be carried out separately from Xi'an and Xianyang, passing through the Longhai and Jinpu railways, and disembarking in Bengbu. A total of one hundred and five trains are expected, and the transport will not be completed until approximately April 20th. As for the location of the Pacification Commissioner's Office and its various departments, Camp Commander Liu Zhenhe has been responsible for surveying and determining the location. It is reported that the entire staff of the Commissioner's Office, estimated at over a thousand people, and most of the officers in various departments are bringing their families. Public housing surveys and private housing rentals have been conducted for days, with demand exceeding supply, resulting in a shortage of housing throughout the city. As a result, housing prices have soared, which has never happened before. Once a large army gathers, the market can be expected to prosper. The residence of Yu Xuezhong and his family has been rented at Tangyuan. In addition, part of Zhang Xueliang's family has also moved to Bengbu. Yu will come to Bengbu to deploy everything. The local community here is preparing to welcome him at that time. (19th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu High Court Hears Case of Foreigner Donating Property to Chinese Government</h3>
<p>The Witness Is Former Acting Minister to Italy, Jiang Fanwu; Liu Wendao, Former Minister to Italy, Investigated the Case and Requested Inquiry</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Jiangsu High Court recently received a case from the Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee for trial. The case involves Jiang Fanwu, a native of Suzhou and former acting Chinese Minister to Italy, accepting a property donated to the Chinese government by a foreigner, Bass. Bass, a German Jew residing in Italy, had always admired Eastern culture. He passed away six years ago, leaving an estate worth approximately 800,000 Chinese yuan, which he bequeathed to the Chinese government for the purpose of promoting Eastern culture. When Acting Minister Jiang in Italy received a notice from the Italian authorities, he decided that whether the Chinese government was willing to accept this estate should be consulted first. Therefore, he telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At that time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs was Luo Wengan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not reply to Acting Minister Jiang's request at first. At this time, Bass's family suddenly raised objections to Bass's will, claiming that the estate should be inherited by the family. They filed a property lawsuit with the Italian judiciary, naming the Chinese government as the defendant. Acting Minister Jiang in Italy then telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again, requesting further instructions. At the same time, he hired an Italian lawyer to deal with the lawsuit. Subsequently, the case was adjudicated, and Bass's estate was to be accepted by the Chinese government. The plaintiff, Bass's family, was ordered to issue a written apology to the Chinese government. After Acting Minister Jiang received the verdict, he received a reply from Foreign Minister Luo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the Chinese government was unwilling to compete with foreigners for property and therefore did not want to accept the estate. After receiving the reply, Acting Minister Jiang said that according to Italian law, anyone unwilling to inherit property must declare it to the local Italian authorities within six months. When the Ministry's reply arrived at the Chinese embassy in Italy, the above-mentioned statutory period had already expired. Moreover, since the estate had already been adjudicated to be accepted by the Chinese government, Bass's funeral should be taken care of as an example, and the litigation costs, including the hiring of lawyers, totaled 160,000 yuan. Therefore, a portion was withdrawn from Bass's estate to pay for it. However, regarding the Ministry's reply, there were practical difficulties, so he hesitated. As a result, except for the 160,000 yuan used to cover the above-mentioned expenses, the rest was not touched. The matter came to an end here. Until the year before last, Liu Wendao was ordered to Italy as Minister. After taking office, he reviewed the case files and found that in addition to the Ministry's reply, there were no documents in the case file that could be used for reference. Liu learned about the process and believed that Acting Minister Jiang had disobeyed government orders. He reported the details to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then sent the case to the Control Yuan for review. The Control Yuan decided to transfer the case to the Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee for deliberation. Now, the Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee has decided to send the case to the Jiangsu High Court for trial. All the case files have been sent to the Jiangsu High Court, and the High Court is investigating the case and will schedule a hearing.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Public Organizations Oppose Collection of Land Value Tax</h3>
<p>Committee Designated to Study Land Value Tax; Telegraph to Officials Requesting Temporary Suspension</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The local government has begun to levy land value tax. Previously, the Provincial Land Administration Bureau sent Ma Yulin to Wuxi as a land value estimator to conduct preliminary estimates. Recently, the Wuxi Native Place Association in Shanghai believed that once the land value tax is levied, the tax rate will be too high to bear. Out of concern for their hometown, they telegraphed the County Chamber of Commerce the other day, asking them to pay attention. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce convened the County Party Department, various public legal organizations, and local people at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 20th) to discuss the matter publicly. More than 100 people attended. Tang Yifang from the County Government and Yan Baozi from the Land Administration Bureau attended as observers. Qian Sunqing, Li Tiping, and Zhang Jichang were publicly elected as the presidium. Qian Sunqing first reported the purpose of the meeting. After deliberation by the public, it was decided: ㊀ In accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions, the collection of taxes should be temporarily suspended before autonomy is completed. A report should be submitted to the province requesting consideration and indicating when the collection will begin. Sun Xixia, Xu Yiting, Zhang Jichang, Li Tiping, Qian Sunqing, and others were appointed to draft the report, which will be jointly discussed on the 22nd. ㊁ Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions regarding the Land Law and Provisional Measures will be compiled into a booklet. Qian Sunqing, Li Tiping, Chen Zhanru, Zhang Jichang, Sun Xixia, Xu Yiting, Cao Hengzhi, Gao Jianxi, Huang Huiru, Hua Chun'an, Tang Lisheng, and others were appointed as members of the Land Value Tax Research Committee, with Li Tiping responsible for convening meetings. The liaison office will be located at the Lawyers' Association. Finally, the Jiangsu Provincial City Land Value Declaration Measures and the issue of the Land Administration Bureau's collection of interest income were discussed. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. It was decided that the interest income already collected by the Land Administration Bureau should be reported by the County Property Office to the county for verification and return. The collection of uncollected interest should be suspended. The meeting concluded at around 6:00 p.m. After the meeting, the five drafting committee members drafted a telegram to the central and provincial authorities requesting a suspension.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Increases Salt Tax in Beijing</h3>
<p>Salt Industry Groups Petition to Stop the Tax</p>
<p>Beijing News: After the opening of Beijing's salt market and the permission of free trade since the year before last, the tax rate was 7 yuan and 1 jiao per dan, which was originally balanced with the tax rates of nearby franchised areas. However, recently, at the request of nearby franchised merchants, the financial authorities actually increased the Beijing salt tax by 6 jiao, 6 fen, and 5 li per dan, nominally called a public welfare donation. Various salt industry groups believe that the increase in Beijing's salt tax not only violates the previous opening purpose, but also contradicts the central government's repeated orders to abolish exorbitant taxes. On the afternoon of the 19th, they went to the Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Administration to meet with Minister Kong and Director Zhu to petition for the cessation of the tax. The Ministry of Finance specially sent Secretary Zhang Shiyun and the Salt Affairs Administration sent Section Chief Zhang Tonggao to receive them. Both agreed to convey the original intention of the petition to stop the public welfare donation for verification. According to the representatives of the petition, this public welfare donation for salt has not gone through the national legislative process, and the people have no obligation to bear it. The current Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage already has clear provisions. They hope that the authorities will stop the tax immediately. If the goal is not achieved, they will petition the municipal government and party headquarters. (Continental News Agency)</p>

However, among them, the county government's expenses were more than 20,000 yuan, and the Land Administration Bureau's expenses were more than 88,000 yuan. Although they were included, the income was offset by subsidies from the provincial treasury.

At the end of last month, Xi went to Shanghai for business and bought a strip of lottery tickets with different numbers. The sales clerk strongly advised him to buy another strip. Xi initially agreed and copied the numbers into his diary. However, after buying the tickets, he hesitated and returned the strip with the number 173879. Later, he saw in the newspaper that the first prize was indeed the returned number. None of the other strips won. He suffered a nervous breakdown and lost his speech.

However, County Magistrate Ma believes that the county is currently collecting new grain taxes, and it is difficult to proceed at the same time. He specially discussed the matter with the official and agreed on a method to wait until the committee has completed the review of each year's outstanding taxes and know the exact number of civilian debts and official debts before starting the clearance, which will be easier to handle. Yesterday (the 19th), it was jointly reported to the department for verification.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Training for All District Baozhangs</p>
<p>There are more than 8,400 Baozhangs in the district under Nantong. The special commissioner's office has scheduled to gather them in batches for training starting from April 15. The classroom will be borrowed from the Nantong Theater and the Provincial Nantong People's Education Hall.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Preparing to Establish Yixing Pawnshop</p>
<p>This county originally had two pawnshops, which were closed down after being looted by the Northern Army in 1927 and have not been restored since. There are only two pawn brokers, Fuchang and Gongji, who deduct 40% per yuan and require waiting five days to redeem items, which is very difficult. Now, Pan Songping and others, merchants from Jiangdu, have gathered 40,000 yuan in capital to open Yixing Pawnshop for the purpose of alleviating poverty. The monthly interest rate is 20%, plus a storage fee of 4%. After submitting the application to the county chamber of commerce and then to the county government for submission to the province for record, it can be opened.</p>
<h3>Legal Tender Exchange Rate Soars</h3>
<p>In this county, the exchange rate of copper coins has been soaring recently due to the surplus of copper coins in the market. On the 15th, each yuan exchanged for 2,130 copper coins, which was 120 copper coins higher than 10 days ago, and it is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Questions Arise Regarding Advertising Donations</p>
<p>The county chamber of commerce believes that the advertising donations collected by the county government from various industries are not handled in accordance with the regulations. For example, advertising donations must be collected for neon lights and flags set up by stores on their own storefronts or corners of the house, which seems to be in conflict with the regulations for collecting advertising donations. As a result, various industries and stores are quite suspicious. The county chamber of commerce has submitted a report to the provincial chamber of commerce federation for transfer to the construction department for a detailed explanation in order to comply.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Reorganizing the Collection of Land Tax</p>
<p>County Magistrate Yu Shuluan is currently planning to reorganize the land tax system in the county. It is stipulated that those who complete payment of each term's tax within the first month will receive a 10% bonus of the regular tax and a certificate of commendation. Those who complete payment three months after the start of collection will be penalized 10% of the regular tax. This is to ensure that the tax is cleared annually. The Land Administration Office is also ordered to quickly compile the total number of fields and rivers in the county to plan for submitting a request to the province for reducing surtaxes. On the other hand, after the land registration and issuance of certificates are completed, land value tax will be implemented to equalize the burden on the people. The salaries of the personnel responsible for tax collection will be changed to a commission system. When the collection is smooth, all expenses for collection, except for the commission, will be accumulated and returned to the public.</p>
<h3>Dinghai</h3>
<p>"Ao Jiang" Ship Sailing Between Shanghai and Shenjiamen</p>
<p>There has been no dedicated ship running between Shenjiamen, Dinghai, and Shanghai. Passengers have had to transfer via Zhoushan and take ships on the Shanghai-Oujiang route. This was particularly inconvenient during the peak fishing season. Recently, shipping merchant Chen Tianshou and others raised funds to lease the "Ao Jiang" ship to run exclusively on the Shenjiamen-Shanghai route, stopping at Shengshan, Sijiao, Huanglong, Daishan, Qushan, and other ports. It is scheduled to run once every five days, with the maiden voyage on the 23rd.</p>

<h3>Over Five Hundred Students Participate in the Middle School Outstanding Students Association</h3>
<p>Director Pan Reports on the Significance of the Association, Tao Baichuan, Jiang Jianbai, and Others Give Speeches</p>
<p>The Joint Meeting of Outstanding Students from Middle Schools, jointly organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters, was held yesterday morning at 8:00 AM at the Hubei Society on Guizhou Road. More than five hundred outstanding students from senior and junior high schools attended. Director Pan presided over the meeting and delivered a report. Tao Baichuan, Jiang Jianbai, and others gave speeches. Students also gave impromptu speeches after drawing lots. At the end, a movie was shown and gifts were distributed. The atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>A total of Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau, Tao Baichuan of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Jiang Jianbai, Chief of the Fifth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, Liu Xuru, Director of the Training Section, Yu Zhongbiao, Executive Secretary of the Education Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and more than five hundred outstanding students from over a hundred schools attended (list attached). The presidium consisted of Pan Gongzhan, Tao Baichuan, and Jiang Jianbai. The General Secretary was Liu Xuru. The Masters of Ceremonies were Nie Haifan. The Recorders were Wang Gongxia and Chen Dongbai. The hosts were Yu Zhongbiao, Peng Zhenqiu, Fan Jiabiao, Wu Xianren, Yang Jialin, Qian Kezan, Jin Zhan, Chen Hongnian, Xiong Pengnan, Gong Xia, Zhai Guanghan, Cao Peimin, Lin Bingcheng, and Xie Chengxun.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Director Pan, the chairman, began by reporting that the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters jointly organized the Chinese Outstanding Students Association. The Municipal Party Headquarters had previously held such events. It was not held last semester due to other events. It has now been decided that the Party and government will jointly organize these events. Not only middle school students, but also university and elementary school students will participate in similar joint meetings of outstanding students. The significance is briefly reported as follows: (1) We feel that our country has reached the beginning of a period of revival, and the nation has transformed from a period of decline to the beginning of a period of prosperity. During this period, efforts are needed in all aspects to enable the nation to accelerate its progress on the road to revival. The efforts of young people are especially necessary. Young people are the treasures of the country. If all young people can develop in an all-around way in terms of intellect, morality, physical fitness, and social skills, it will lay the foundation for the revival of the country. Especially young people who are studying in schools should be encouraged to work hard and make progress. On the one hand, it depends on their own efforts, and on the other hand, the supervision and encouragement of the environment also has an impact. Therefore, holding this outstanding student association can help them encourage each other, so that the excellent foundation will not be destroyed, and at the same time, even better talents can be established. (2) No one can say that they are absolutely flawless. Everyone has some strengths and some weaknesses. Therefore, we are not asking everyone to be flawless, but we are asking everyone to give full play to their strengths, so that their strengths exceed their weaknesses. The ancient Chinese sage kings took hiding evil and promoting good as the basis for governing the country and pacifying the world. However, the social customs of China in recent decades have been the opposite. Everyone pays attention to criticizing the shortcomings of others and exposing the bad deeds of others. As a result, there are really no good people in society. Therefore, we must change this and unreservedly hide evil and promote good, and do it from schools. Teachers examine and select outstanding students. In this way, everyone will be willing to be a good student. Although "Is he not a gentleman who does not feel resentful when others do not know him?" Good students do not necessarily have to be known, but they will definitely be happier when they are known. The Analects say, "Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters?" There is a reason for this joy. Because they study hard, friends from afar come to see them, of course, they are happy. Therefore, the association is to change the bad habit of promoting evil and hiding good. The famous American diplomat Franklin said that his success was that he never spoke of other people's shortcomings, but only praised their strengths. It can be seen that the truth is unbreakable and universal. (3) The greatest help in seeking knowledge is from famous teachers and good friends. The so-called famous teachers are not necessarily famous, as long as they live up to their name and fulfill their duties, they are famous teachers. Of course, there are famous teachers in schools, but good friends are more difficult to find. Therefore, the association is to choose a group of the best friends for you to encourage and supervise each other, which has a great impact on you and the country and nation. There is a Tongwen College in Shanghai, which does not seem to be well known to everyone. However, when Chinese people do not understand the situation in China, they go to Tongwen College. They are all fully aware of it, because their students travel to various parts of China during the holidays to conduct inspections and report to the school. Over time, they naturally understand everything. There are many schools in Shanghai, and they come from all over the country, but why can't they know the situation in their own regions? Because there is no organization, education is a place. Therefore, the association is to give full play to the strengths of each person, unite together, learn from each other, and do it batch by batch. It will definitely make a great contribution to the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Speech by Committee Member Tao</p>
<p>Next, Tao Baichuan, a committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave a speech, introducing the youth movements in Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Because these three countries represent three different political systems: Fascism, Communism, and Democracy. (1) The German youth movement has the Hitler Youth, which stipulates that those aged ten to eighteen should participate. In the past, participation was voluntary, but now it is compulsory. The method is to set up summer camps in various places. Many young people go to nearby camps during the holidays, camp together, and live on their own, so that they can meet each other, connect their feelings, and exchange knowledge. The German summer camps have made a great contribution to the world. We hope that Shanghai can also have this facility, so that Shanghai students and young people from the mainland who come to Shanghai can enjoy it, which is much more beneficial than staying in hotels. The second is the labor service corps. China also has it now. They stipulate that those over the age of nineteen must join, otherwise they will not be able to find a job after graduation. The time is half a year. The work is building dikes, logging, shipbuilding, and improving cultivated land. They serve eight hours a day without remuneration. After graduation, they are given a certificate. With this certificate, they can find a job in society, so this has become an obligation. China is still voluntary. (2) The Soviet Russian youth training is the Pioneer Team. All those aged ten to sixteen should participate. They have five rules: (1) Team members should protect their own and other people's bodies. (2) They should be economical with time and not waste it, and use their spare time. Work should be done quickly. (3) They should be diligent, persevere, and be able to cooperate with others. (4) They should cherish public and private property. (5) Do not make oaths, do not smoke, and do not drink. In addition to the rules, there are five wishes, of which one can be put forward. The first wish is that team members should be determined to work for the welfare of workers, peasants, and civilians in the future, that is, not to add flowers to the brocade, but to send charcoal in the snow. The fifth wish is to study hard, because knowledge and skills are the greatest power to seek welfare for workers, peasants, and civilians. Above the Pioneer Team is the Communist Youth League, that is, CX. In the past, they specialized in waving flags, shouting slogans, and posting slogans. Starting last year, they were not allowed to do this political activity, but they did three things: reading, sports, and military training, especially paying attention to sports. Currently, Russia has 4,550 sports fields and 800 swimming pools, which can be seen at a glance. The central government gives CXO medals to those who are good at sports. The meaning is preparation for labor and national defense. (3) The American youth movement organization has CCC, that is, the Citizens' Voluntary Conservation Corps, which does the work of preserving forests. Because the United States produces a lot of wood, and there are large forests everywhere, if they are infested by insects or burned, the losses will be great. Therefore, unemployed young people are recruited and sent to the army. After being organized by military officers, they are sent to forest houses to camp. In the morning, they receive military training. During the day, they build bridges and roads and pay attention to forests. They work eight hours. In the evening, they read books in the camp, teaching vocational knowledge. Food and clothing are supplied by the state, and the monthly salary is thirty yuan, but twenty-five yuan must be sent home. It started to be organized three years ago. According to statistics last year, there were more than 500,000 people. They built 100,000 miles of roads, 30,000 bridges, cleared insects from 5 million acres of forests, and built 150 dams. Its greatness can be seen. From the above youth training of Feng Guojia, we can get the conclusion: (1) The youth movement in the past was done by schools, but now schools are doing it, and government party departments are also doing it, which can be a unified step. (2) The training in the past was only training people, but now, in addition to training people, they also have to be trained into citizens. The words people and citizens are different. People are seen in social aspects, and citizens are seen in national aspects. Citizens are of course people, but people are not necessarily citizens. Good citizens are good people, but good people are not necessarily good citizens. (3) The training in the past was static, and the training now is dynamic. Our Chinese New Life Movement and Labor Service Movement are also like this. I hope everyone will work hard.</p>
<p>Speech by Section Chief Jiang</p>
<p>Next, Section Chief Jiang gave a speech, saying that when he was in middle school, there was also a selection of model students. The standard was to select those with excellent intelligence, morality, physical fitness, and service ability. These model students often served other students. During the May Fourth Movement, these model students were elected to lead the patriotic work. The work went smoothly and the students believed in them very much. Therefore, I got two thoughts from this: (1) Excellent students should be serving others, so they are service students. (2) Since the May Fourth Movement, the students who do the work only know how to move around, and their knowledge, morality, and physical fitness are not good, so they cannot lead. Therefore, we want excellent students to create an atmosphere and set an example.</p>
<p>Student Speeches</p>
<p>The presidium then drew lots to determine three senior high school students and three junior high school students to give speeches. The topics were designated by the Social Affairs Bureau as twelve topics below: (1) Loyalty and courage are the foundation of patriotism. (2) Filial piety is the foundation of managing the family. (3) Benevolence and love are the foundation of dealing with others. (4) Faithfulness and righteousness are the foundation of establishing a career. (5) Peace is the foundation of dealing with others. (6) Etiquette is the foundation of governing the world. (7) Obedience is the foundation of responsibility. (8) Diligence and thrift are the foundation of service. (9) Neatness is the foundation of strengthening the body. (10) Helping others is the foundation of happiness. (11) Learning is the foundation of benefiting the world. (12) Perseverance is the foundation of success. Those who were drawn chose a topic each, and each person's speech time was five minutes. The senior high school students were Zhuo Baoheng of Nanyang Middle School, who spoke on benevolence and love as the foundation of dealing with others; Yao Lianjuan of Wuben, who spoke on perseverance as the foundation of success; and Huang Yanping of Private Shangzhong, who spoke on etiquette as the foundation of governing the world. The junior high school students were Yang Renji of Yucai, who spoke on perseverance as the foundation of success; Huang Nanchang of Zhonghua Vocational School, who spoke on learning as the foundation of benefiting the world; and Shen Dehua of Shenmei Girls' Middle School, who spoke on perseverance as the foundation of success. The topics of each student's speech were drawn on the spot, but they were still able to speak fluently, which was quite commendable.</p>
<p>Distribution of Gifts</p>
<p>After the meeting, gifts were distributed. In addition to a bag of fruits and snacks for each person, there were also gifts such as books. There were 300 packages of Qianmen Tooth Powder from the Family Industry Cooperative, three dozen tubes of Invincible Toothpaste, three copies of the "Complete Map of the Chinese Provinces" from the Shenbao Library, Mussolini's Biography, Kemal's Biography, Roosevelt's Biography, Mussolini's Collection of Speeches, Knowledge of New Weapons, National Defense and Aviation, and Vitalism from Zhengzhong Bookstore, two copies each; Outline of Air Defense, Nursing, and Poison Prevention, New Life of Children, New Life of Students, four copies each; White Girl, Baby Eating and Drinking, Regret of a Misstep, Competition in the Human Bacterial World, Strengthening the Body and Strengthening the Species, Self-Reliance, Huaisheng's Inspection Notes, First Aid, Hailin Liang Practicing Martial Arts, one copy each; two dozen toys from Kangyuan Can Factory, one brocade box, five sets of Middle School Graduation Test Preparation Books from Dadong Bookstore, thirty copies, twenty-eight copies of Children's World from Commercial Press, twenty copies of Oriental Magazine, twenty copies of Education Magazine, three copies of Student Dictionary from World Bookstore, three copies of Scientific Knowledge, three copies of Model Chinese Small Dictionary, one copy of Biography of Scientists, ten copies of Standard National Phonetic Student Dictionary from Zhonghua Bookstore, five copies of Chinese Idiom Dictionary, ten copies of How to Use Punctuation Marks, ten copies of the complete set of National Defense Series, twenty pieces of New Youth Magazine annual subscription certificates for self-collection from Kaiming Bookstore, ten pieces of Middle School Student Magazine annual subscription certificates for self-collection.

<h3>Feng Nianhua's Absence Causes the Chinese Basketball Team to Lose to the Military Academy</h3>
<p>The Result is Forty-Eight to Fifty-Nine Feng Arrives For The Second Game Today</p>
<p>▲Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) The Shanghai Chinese basketball team, led by coach Li Baojun, arrived in Nanjing on the 19th. At 4:00 PM on the 20th, they played against the Military Academy for the first time at the Amateur Sports Association. More than a thousand spectators attended. The Chinese team was greatly weakened by the absence of Feng Nianhua and Chen Xianglong. The Military Academy won 59-48. The first half was 29-25, with the Military Academy winning by only four points. In the last five minutes, the score was tied at forty. The Chinese team was unable to sustain their energy, which led to the defeat. Wang Yuzeng played despite being ill and did not perform well. Bao Wenpei and Guo Zhenji were very active. Wang Nanzhen and Zhou Dayun were the most outstanding players in the Chinese team. The second match will be held at the same venue at 3:00 PM on the 21st. Feng Chen and the two generals of the Chinese team will arrive on the evening of the 20th, and the outcome is unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Teams Participate in Today's Jiangwan Cross-Country Race</h3>
<p>One Hundred and Forty Chinese and Western Athletes Set Off at 11 O'Clock in Hongkou Park</p>
<p>The six-mile Jiangwan team cross-country championship, organized by the Shanghai Sports Association, is scheduled to start at 11:00 AM today at the west gate of Hongkou Park. The Suke and Ermai teams did not register due to events. Therefore, only fourteen teams are participating. The top eight players from each team will be selected. Seventeen individuals are participating, including athletes from China, England, the United States, France, Russia, Japan, India, and other countries. Ninety-one of them are Chinese. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Competition Rules</p>
<p>(1) Each team shall consist of eight or ten players. However, only the first eight players to reach the finish line will be counted. The remaining players will be considered as individuals. (1) The awards for each team will be determined after the competition. The team with the fewest points will be the winning team. (1) Athletes must not go beyond the prescribed route twelve yards on either side and must not take shortcuts. Violators will be disqualified. Referees will be stationed at each section. After the competition, the numbers of the athletes will be reported. If it is found that they withdrew midway or took shortcuts, etc., (1) Athletes must wear the number cloth on their chest and back. Each team leader should check whether their members have followed these rules. (1) Athletes must not walk slowly. (1) If any disputes arise, the chief referee will decide. (1) Athletes must have resided in this city for more than two months.</p>
<p>Among the teams, the strongest is undoubtedly Wuhe. However, Wuhe only has Wang Zhenglin, Wu Wenlin, Ling Xuewen, Guan Youwen, Zhang Liang, etc. However, the lineup is not very neat. The second is the Shanghai Sports Association A team, which has Niu Hongquan, Li Duan, Ma Riji, Gao Basheng, Xi Peng, Niu Qibao, etc., all of whom are well-known players. The championship will undoubtedly be contested between Wuhe and the Shanghai Sports Association.</p>
<p>Individual Aspects</p>
<p>The individual championship will be contested by Wang Zhenglin, Wu Wenlin, Niu Hongquan, Ling Xuewen, etc. However, Wang Zhenglin's strength is not as strong as Wu Wenlin's. During each practice, it is common to see Wu Wenlin letting Wang Zhenglin arrive first. Recalling the last champion, Wang Zhenglin, and Wu Wenlin were only a foot apart. He, like Li Duan, Ma Riji, Gao Basheng, Xi Peng, etc., all have hopes of finishing in the top ten.</p>

We believe that the plans for the hall are practically geared towards common prosperity. Old habits are eliminated, and new undertakings are greatly promoted. The Association's feelings are like the offerings of humble gifts, slightly expressing the privacy of love and respect. The friendship is as close as the sunflowers tilting towards the sun, respectfully expressing the praise of joy. We humbly present a set of domestically produced silk禮服 (formal wear) blue robe and black jacket. I humbly present this to you, and humbly hope for the brilliance of domestic goods. The brightly colored black clothing is suitable as clothing for auspicious people. I respectfully hope for your acceptance, and I cannot express my utmost honor," etc. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Luo Qinghua, accompanied by Wu Xingcha and Pan Yisheng, the standing committee members of the association, drove to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Department with the formal wear and respectfully presented it. Mayor Wu and Director Pan personally accepted it and expressed their gratitude.

(New Sound Society)</p>
<p>Traffic Issues</p>

It was originally planned to be jointly organized by the Social Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, convening relevant companies and businesses. It is reported that this matter requires consultation with various transportation companies and the Railway Bureau in charge of the Songhu (Shanghai-Hangzhou) Railway and requires requesting instructions from higher-level agencies for approval, which takes a lot of time.

<h3>Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>Political Obstacles Must Be Removed First</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, left Nanjing by night train at 11:00 PM the night before and arrived at the North Shanghai Railway Station at 6:50 AM yesterday. He went directly to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest and plans to stay in Shanghai for two or three days before returning to Nanjing to preside over the Yuan's affairs. According to Sun, cooperation is welcome with any country that treats us equally and does not harm our sovereignty and territorial principles. However, "we will not discuss what is taken, and we want cooperation." We absolutely cannot accept this kind of national cooperation that betrays national interests. Sino-Japanese economic cooperation must first remove political obstacles before it can be realized. Before the issues of eastern Hebei, northern Chahar, and smuggling are resolved, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is impossible to discuss. I would like to tell the people of the whole country that cooperation between the two countries can only be achieved when their strengths are equal. If we want to cooperate with others, we must first have the determination and strength to resist the war. The issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction also depends on our self-improvement. The British coronation ceremony will be attended by Kong Xiangxi, Chen Shaokuan, and Guo Taiqi. I have not yet decided when I will go to Guangdong for inspection.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Kong Hosted Tea Party Yesterday to Bid Farewell to British Consul-General Brennan</h3>
<p>Sir Brennan Boards Ship Today to Return Home</p>
<p>The outgoing British Consul-General in Shanghai, Sir Brennan, and his wife are scheduled to depart for their home country today on the Empress of Asia mail ship and will not hold formal ceremonies. It is reported that they will have lunch on the ship and then receive farewells from friends between 3:00 and 4:00 PM. The Empress of Asia is scheduled to leave the Hongkou Wharf at 4:00 PM, taking the route through Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and then to Vancouver. After arriving in England, Sir Brennan will work in the Far East Department of the Foreign Office. On Thursday night, the Shanghai Consular Corps and on Friday night, the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce and the China Association hosted banquets at the Shanghai Club to bid farewell to Sir Brennan. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, and his wife hosted a special tea party at their residence on West Ainsworth Road to bid farewell, and invited Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Shanghai Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting, Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, Bell, the Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy, Herbert Babbage, the Secretary of the British Embassy's Shanghai Office, Rogers, the British Economic Advisor's representative in Shanghai, Muller, the Commissioner of Customs for Jianghai Customs, Chen Xing, the Vice President of the Central Bank, Xi Demao, the Director of the Business Bureau, and Xu Jianping, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, and their wives. Minister Kong was unable to return to Shanghai due to business, so his son, Ling Kan, represented him in hosting the event and read Kong's farewell speech, which stated, "Sir Brennan and his wife will depart for their home country tomorrow (today). Today, we are honored to gather together. Sir Brennan has made great contributions to promoting Sino-British relations. He will now return home to take a key position in the British Foreign Office. My friendship with Sir Brennan dates back to 1926 when Sir Brennan was the Consul-General in Guangzhou and I was the Director of the Guangdong Finance Department. Our friendship is very close. Today, I recall the process of resolving the issue of the land ownership purchased by the British authorities in Guangzhou City to build the consulate, and I still have joy. Before Shamian was opened as a British concession, the British authorities purchased a piece of land in Guangzhou City to build a consulate. After Shamian had a British concession, the land became useless. At that time, I was the Director of the Finance Department and proposed to return the ownership of the land to the provincial government. Sir Brennan immediately agreed with my proposal and submitted a request to the US Embassy to discuss with the British government and return the land. This matter was resolved and satisfied both parties. Today, I bring up the old matter because it can serve as a clear proof of the British diplomatic spirit of fairness and Sir Brennan's service in the British diplomatic circles, which can be called one of the best. Sir Brennan has been in China for many years and has met many friends from China and abroad. I have been busy with official duties in Nanjing and Shanghai, and I can only hold a brief banquet before their departure to England, and I cannot provide more support, which is a pity. However, what we are happy about is that Sir Brennan's future position will further help his government. Sir Brennan is knowledgeable about the situation in China and has always maintained a friendly attitude towards the Chinese government and people. It is expected that he will be able to make more contributions to consolidating the existing friendly relations between China and Britain. The gentlemen present here will join me in wishing Sir Brennan and his wife all the best for the future," etc. Then, Sir Brennan stood up to reply, expressing his gratitude to Kong and his wife for their hospitality and praise. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 6:00 PM when they dispersed. It is reported that Sir Brennan came to China in 1905 and served in the British Inspectorate of the Chinese Maritime Customs in Beijing. He then successively served as British Consul in Guangzhou, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Jinan, and Tianjin. Later, he was transferred to Shanghai as British Consul-General and has been in office for seven years. He is highly regarded among the foreign diplomatic representatives stationed in China and has a particularly deep friendship with the Chinese authorities. Moreover, he has lived in this country for a long time and is knowledgeable about the national situation and the people's sentiments. It is expected that after taking up his new position in the Foreign Office in the future, he will be able to make more contributions to Sino-British relations.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council sent a letter to the British Consul-General and Senior Consul of the Consular Corps, Sir Brennan, on the 20th. The translation is as follows: "Your Consul-General will leave office tomorrow and be honorably promoted to a new position in the Foreign Office. The Council of this Bureau is deeply saddened by the imminent separation. Your Consul-General has cooperated with this Bureau for many years and has always been harmonious. This Bureau is deeply grateful. We hereby express our thanks and wish your Consul-General and your wife a bright future and a smooth and pleasant journey."</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Returned to Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, accompanied by Vice Minister Xu Kan, Counselor Li Yuwan, and Secretary-General Tan Guang of the Central Bank, took a train from Nanjing at 3:00 PM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 9:26 PM. Kong, who also serves as the Governor of the Central Bank, usually takes the night train to Nanjing every Monday to attend important central meetings and handle important official matters. On Thursdays, he comes to Shanghai from Nanjing to preside over the Central Bank's business and local finance. This time, because he will soon be going abroad, all financial matters must be properly arranged. He has been busy in Nanjing for days revising the Central Bank's Organic Law and reviewing the national revenue and expenditure budget for the 26th year, which has been quite hectic. Therefore, he was delayed until yesterday to return to Shanghai. It is reported that the Central Bank's Organic Law has been reviewed for the last time by the joint meeting of the Legal, Financial, and Economic Committees of the Central Political Committee and will be submitted to the Political Committee for discussion next Wednesday. Regarding the national revenue and expenditure budget for the 26th year, it was reviewed at a meeting of ministers from various Yuan (branches of government) the day before yesterday and has been generally finalized. Although the new budget has increased education and construction allocations compared to before, the balance between revenue and expenditure is a good sign for China's financial future.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning's Continued Talks by the Sino-Japanese Trade Association at the Zhou Residence</h3>
<p>Noon Banquet by the Three Banks for Kodama and Others, Evening Reciprocal Banquet by Kodama and Others for Various Circles</p>
<p>The Japanese economic leaders, including Kenji Kodama, who have come to China, have been very busy with banquets in Shanghai in recent days. Yesterday, in addition to attending a banquet hosted by the Three Banks and a tea party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office, they also went to Zhou Zuomin's residence in the morning to continue their talks, and inquired in detail about the financial and industrial situation in China. They did not leave until noon. It is reported that Ambassador Xu Shiying and Zhou Zuomin, among others, are scheduled to host a banquet for Kodama and others today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Continued Talks</p>
<p>Although Kodama Kenji and others have stated that their visit to China is solely for attending the first general meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association held in Shanghai, their main task is to take this opportunity to exchange views on economic cooperation between the two countries. Although all the people who came with him are members of the association, they are also important figures in the Japanese financial and business circles. Kodama and others went to Zhou Zuomin's residence again yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to hold talks. Many directors from both the Chinese and Japanese sides of the association were invited to participate. During the meeting, Kodama and others inquired about the financial and industrial situation in China, and the Chinese directors provided detailed answers and presented various publications for reference. At the same time, the Chinese side also inquired in detail about the economic situation in Japan. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>Progress of the Talks</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency learned that Zhou Zuomin, Kodama, and others held three symposiums in the International Hotel and Zhou's residence in recent days. All directors of the association and the visiting Japanese personnel participated. The first one was held on the morning of the opening day of the general meeting at Zhou's residence, which was merely to introduce the personnel from both sides and to have general conversations and exchange of opinions. The second one was held the day before yesterday at the International Hotel, which was to continue discussing the progress of the association's affairs. Regarding the establishment of investigation departments by the association in both Shanghai and Tokyo, Zhou Zuomin and Kodama, the two chairmen, were entrusted to be responsible based on the principles passed by the general meeting. The third meeting yesterday morning was more important, as Kodama and others had been able to learn the general will of China through various contacts. However, in order to further understand the actual situation of China's economy and industry, they inquired in detail, and the actual situation in Japan was also clearly explained. When talking about the past, if there were any gaps or misunderstandings, the Chinese side raised questions, and the Japanese side explained them sincerely. As for the sugar, match, and textile industries, the relations between the two countries are more extensive, and many members of both sides are important figures engaged in the above industries. They had earnest discussions, but it is not known whether concrete results have been reached.</p>
<p>Banquet by the Three Banks</p>
<p>The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications hosted a banquet for Kenji Kodama and others at the Central Bank Club on Lujiazui Road in Shanghai West at 1:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 guests and hosts attended. In addition to Japanese Embassy secretaries Tajiri, Yoshioka, Somi, Shimizu, Commercial Attaché Iwai, Financial Attaché Inamori, Consul General Kawai, Consul Fukui, and our Mayor Wu, Director Zhou, the Chinese and Japanese guests were mostly leaders from the financial and business circles of both countries. President Kong Xiangxi of the Central Bank was unable to attend due to official business in Beijing. Vice President Chen Xing, Chairman Song Ziwen of the Bank of China, General Manager Song Hanzhang, General Manager Tang Shoumin of the Bank of Communications, and other important staff members of the three banks were responsible for the reception. There was much toasting, laughter, and lively conversation.</p>
<p>Chen Xing's Speech</p>
<p>Chen Xing gave a speech on behalf of the hosts, saying, "Chairman Kodama, members of the delegation, today, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have prepared a simple banquet to welcome you. President Kong of the Central Bank is in Beijing on official business, and Chairman Song of the Bank of China is unable to speak due to a cold. Chairman Hu of the Bank of Communications has also entrusted me to speak on his behalf. Therefore, I will represent the three banks to say a few words to you. "You are leaders in the Japanese financial and industrial circles, with rich knowledge and experience. You will definitely be able to provide accurate observations on the development of our country's industry and the improvement of our finance. Since the Meiji Restoration, the development of Japan's financial industry has been very rapid. Of course, there have been difficulties and obstacles, but you have overcome these difficulties and eliminated these obstacles to achieve today's prosperity. You have personally experienced all of this and made great contributions. All of this experience is enough for our country to learn from. Today, we gather together, and I hope that you can give us some guidance. The economic relations between China and Japan have always been very close and have a very long history. There was commercial exchange as early as the Later Han Dynasty. During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, Sino-Japanese trade was at its peak. At that time, the financial relations between China and Japan also arose. Although there were some periods in between when obstacles arose due to other influences, they soon returned to their original state. Therefore, from a historical perspective, the economic relations between the two countries have sometimes been uncoordinated, but through the efforts of the people of both countries, any gaps have been immediately eliminated. In recent years, Sino-Japanese exchange rates have often fluctuated greatly due to the rise and fall of world silver prices. Trade between the two countries has been largely speculative. This is a major obstacle to the future of Sino-Japanese economic coordination. However, since the reform of our country's currency system, this obstacle has been removed, and Sino-Japanese exchange rates have become stable. In the future, Sino-Japanese trade should achieve sound development. Now, with the opportunity of the visit of distinguished guests to China, we can gather economic figures from China and Japan together to study and discuss with a sincere attitude and frank words, and work together. I firmly believe that the future of economic coordination between the two countries and the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity can be achieved." Today's banquet is very simple, and we are deeply honored by your presence. On behalf of our three banks, I would like to raise a glass to wish Chairman Kodama and all members of the economic mission good health and success."</p>
<p>Kodama's Reply</p>
<p>Kodama then stood up and gave a reply, saying, "I am deeply grateful for the gracious hospitality of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications today. I am especially grateful that Chairman Song of the Bank of China attended despite his illness. I have just heard Vice President Chen's speech on how to seek Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, which is a very pertinent point. Our delegation has come to Shanghai and Beijing from Japan, and we have had repeated banquets and speeches, which have been nothing more than three things: how to adjust diplomatic relations, how to harmonize national feelings, and how to advance economic cooperation. I also think so. As the ancient Chinese proverb says, 'As long as we can be honest with each other, it is not difficult to become bosom friends.' If actions do not follow words, then pleasant words are only superficial friendship. I hope that we can all be open and honest with each other and treat each other with sincerity in order to achieve ideal friendship. Today, I am honored to receive such a grand banquet. On behalf of my colleagues, I would like to thank you and raise a glass to wish you all good health." The banquet ended at about 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Zhou's Tea Party</p>
<p>Zhou Jue, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, also held a tea party at the office from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM yesterday. The guests of honor, Kenji Kodama and others, arrived in succession at about 5:00 PM and were personally received by Zhou Jue, Zhao Tiezhang, and others. They were entertained with champagne, tea, and refreshments, and had a pleasant chat for a long time before leaving. The Chinese and Japanese guests who were invited to participate included Xu Shiying, Yang Hu, Zhou Zuomin, Yu Qiaqing, Huang Bodu, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Yisheng, Du Yuesheng, Xu Xiuzhi, Wang Yutong, Zhou Wenbin, Chen Bofan, Hu Boxiang, and Consul General Kawai, Consul Fukui, and Embassy Secretaries Shimizu and Tajiri, totaling more than 100 people. The atmosphere was very grand.</p>
<p>Kodama's Reciprocal Banquet</p>
<p>Kenji Kodama hosted a reciprocal banquet for various circles in China and Japan at the Sixth and Third Garden at 7:00 PM last night. The guests included our Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying, leaders of the financial and business circles Chen Xing, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Xinliu, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Zuoting, Li Fusun, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yunzhai, Zhong Bingfeng, Xu Xiuzhi, and Japanese Embassy Secretary Tajiri, Consul General Kawai Tatsuo, Commander of the Third Fleet Hasegawa Kiyoshi, Chief of Staff Sugiyama Rokusa, Commander of the Special Naval Landing Force Okawauchi Denhichi, Commander of the Eleventh Squadron Tanimoto Matataro, Naval Attaché Honda Tadao, and leaders of the financial and business circles Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Yoshida Seiji, Sato Kiichiro, Urabe Takuo, Shihi Sen, Tanaka Kanji, Tanabe Teruo, Nishikawa Reiji, Ishida Shuji, Ueda Kenjiro, and Kanou Masaburo, totaling more than 90 people. Kodama, accompanied by Yabuki Keiichi, Muto Shutaro, Honma Seibei, and Fukamachi Naichirō, provided the reception. The guests were divided into ten tables, with many Japanese geishas accompanying and serving wine. They enjoyed themselves and had lively conversations. At the end, songs and dances were performed to entertain the guests, and the banquet ended late at night.</p>
<p>Future Actions</p>
<p>Kodama and others have been in Shanghai for four days. The schedule of banquets arranged by various circles in the city ended yesterday. However, they still need to stay in Shanghai for a few days. Therefore, our Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying has specifically scheduled a private banquet at the International Hotel at noon today. Zhou Zuomin, Qian Xinzhi, and Du Yuesheng have also scheduled a public banquet at Liu Hongsheng's private residence on Avenue Haig at 7:00 PM this evening. It is reported that Kodama and others will be visiting various friends freely from today and will leave Shanghai one after another after the 23rd. Sato Keizaburo, Miyajima Kiyojiro, and Taihei Ken three people are scheduled to take a plane to Qingdao on the 23rd and transfer to various places in Pingjin. Kodama will remain in Shanghai and will be the last to leave Shanghai, taking a ship directly back to China.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Speaks on Impressions of the Suiyuan Trip</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Chu Minyi recently accompanied Chairman Wang on a trip to Taiyuan and then to Suiyuan to attend the memorial service for the military and civilians who died in the Suiyuan defense war and the military parade. He completed his official duties on the 18th and returned to Beijing. He left Beijing on a night train last night at 11:00 PM and arrived at the North Station in Shanghai at about 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He went straight to his private residence on Avenue Albert for a rest. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chu yesterday afternoon and had the following conversation:</p>
<p>Impressions of the Suiyuan Trip</p>
<p>According to Chu, Suiyuan is a place he has visited before. He has been there twice before, and this is his third time. He deeply feels that the construction of Suiyuan has made great progress compared to before. It is admirable that Suiyuan is still devoting itself to construction in the midst of war. The morale of the people of Suiyuan is very high, and the officers and soldiers have no arrogance at all. This must be attributed to Chairman Fu Zuoyi's effective leadership. Suiyuan is currently focusing on citizen training. The citizens who were trained also participated in the military parade held in Suiyuan this time. Although they only had one month of training, their steps were neat, and their spirits were full, which was no less than that of the soldiers. This is truly "the strength of the North." Chairman Wang gave two speeches at the memorial service for the military and civilians who died in the Suiyuan defense war and the military parade, which greatly moved the military and civilians.</p>
<p>Construction in Shanxi Province</p>
<p>Director Yan (Xishan) is working hard on economic construction in Shanxi. During his stay in Taiyuan, he talked about the economic construction plan passed by the Third Plenary Session. Yan expressed his determination to promote it. This was my first visit to Taiyuan. I took a short tour of the city and its suburbs in a hurry and deeply felt the progress of Taiyuan's construction. It is a pity that I did not have time to visit various well-equipped factories, which I deeply regret.</p>
<p>A Week-Long Tour of Beijing and Yunnan</p>
<p>For several years, the National Economic Commission has been committed to the construction of highways, and the results have been exceptionally satisfactory. Although Beijing and Yunnan are far apart, a direct highway has been completed. The Executive Yuan has organized a week-long tour group of the Beijing-Yunnan Highway. I was ordered to be the head of the group and invited representatives from various departments, ministries, commissions, business leaders, and the press circles of Beijing and Shanghai. We are scheduled to depart from Beijing on April 5 and reach Kunming via seven provinces: Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan. Then we will return north in two routes. One route will take the sea route back north via Chongqing, and the other route will take the train back north via Guilin and Hengyang. We will stay for one or two days or three to five days in the important cities along the way to conduct inspections in groups. In addition to publicizing the central government's intentions and expressing sympathy for the people's suffering in order to closely communicate between the central government and the local governments, I will also inspect the situation of transportation, education, economy, sports, and national elections.</p>
<p>Progress of National Elections</p>
<p>The preliminary election of representatives to the National Assembly is nearing completion. Now that the election law has been changed, it must wait for the Standing Committee to discuss and pass it next week, and then hand it over to the Legislative Yuan for amendment before proceeding with the second election. The National Art Exhibition is scheduled to open on April 1. I am responsible for the photography aspect. In addition to the more than 100 pieces that have been received, I will also collect the works of famous artists in Shanghai. After the review in Shanghai on the 26th, they will be sent to Beijing for exhibition. I am scheduled to return to Beijing next Tuesday, he said.</p>

<h3>Sixteen Organizations Welcomed Xu Shiying and Xiong Xiling Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xu Reported on Various Matters Since His Year as Ambassador to Japan</p>
<p>Xiong Reported on His Attendance at the Conference on the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children</p>
<p>Sixteen organizations, including the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, the Local Association, and various charitable organizations, held a joint tea party at the Sixth Floor of the Pudong Native Place Association yesterday afternoon to welcome Xu Shiying, our Ambassador to Japan, and philanthropist Xiong Xiling. More than 100 representatives from various organizations attended, including Li Dachao, representative of Mayor Wu, Zhang Binghui, representative of Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yiting, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jinqing, and Chen Heqin.</p>
<p>Wang's Speech</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai was elected to deliver a welcome speech, which briefly stated, "Today, sixteen organizations are holding a joint tea party to welcome Mr. Xu and Mr. Xiong. I am honored to be able to participate. Ambassador Xu has worked hard for the country and has made remarkable achievements in handling Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Now he is returning to China on leave. Mr. Xiong has been engaged in charitable undertakings in the country, benefiting the disaster victims, and his merits are immeasurable. Now he has returned from attending the Far Eastern Conference on the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children. The colleagues of various organizations in this city admire Mr. Xu and Mr. Xiong for their dedication to the country and the public, and they are holding a tea party to welcome them and gather together to reminisce."</p>
<p>Ambassador Xu's Reply</p>
<p>Ambassador Xu gave a reply, saying, "I was ordered to serve as Ambassador to Japan, and I departed from Shanghai on March 26 of last year and departed from Tokyo on March 26 of this year. I served for a total of one year. Recalling that before I took office, I was warmly welcomed by the elders and friends at sea. The feeling of reluctance at that time is still vivid in my mind. Today, I am also grateful for the welcome from various public organizations. I know the care of you all, and I would like to report on various matters during my year in office. The term of office can be divided into four periods. The first period, from March to July, was a chaotic period because incidents of Japanese people being victimized occurred in Chengdu, Beihai, and Shanghai one after another, and Sino-Japanese relations were becoming increasingly chaotic. In August and September, the incidents of Japanese people being victimized continued to occur, and Sino-Japanese relations became increasingly tense. Therefore, the second period can be called the tense period. After the recovery of Bailingmiao, Japan began to realize that it was necessary to re-examine its policy towards China, and there was a slight opportunity for a shift in relations between the two countries. Therefore, the third period can be called the transition period. After the Xi'an Incident was resolved, the Japanese increasingly realized that our country, both above and below, has been able to unite as one, and the re-examination of the policy towards China has spread throughout the Japanese government and public, and relations between the two countries have been improving. Therefore, the fourth period can be called the improvement period." Xu continued, "I have never handled diplomacy before. This time, I was ordered to serve as Ambassador to Japan, but I only adhered to the four words 'justice and sincerity.' All diplomatic negotiations with Japan were conducted in accordance with the central government's intentions. I deeply feel that the victory or failure of diplomacy lies in seeking oneself, not seeking others. I often hear people say that Sino-Japanese diplomacy is on the verge of collapse. It must be known that those who fear collapse will see collapse immediately. Those who do not fear collapse will never collapse." Ambassador Xu concluded by saying, "In my year in Japan, I saw the virtues of tension, constant tension, and tension in everything filling the country, and I deeply hope that the people of the country will pay attention and follow suit."</p>
<p>Xiong's Report</p>
<p>After Ambassador Xu finished his speech, Mr. Xiong Xiling gave a speech, which reported on his visit to Southeast Asia to attend the Far Eastern Conference on the Suppression of Traffic in Women and Children and the current situation of overseas Chinese in the Southeast Asia region. The general content was the same as the report given by Mr. Xiong when he returned to China. The words are long and omitted.</p>

<h3>Japanese and Korean Rogues Transported a Large Number of Copper Coins for Export Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Seven of Our Customs Officers Were Beaten, One Officer's Hand Bone Was Broken</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that at 3:00 AM yesterday, about 60 rogues from a certain country transported a large number of copper coins (worth more than 10,000 yuan in national currency) to the Huishan Wharf, hoping to load them onto the Shanghai Maru for export. Upon arrival at the wharf, they were discovered and stopped by our customs officers. The rogues pulled out iron rulers and other weapons and violently attacked the customs officers. Seven officers were injured, one of whom had a broken hand bone. More than 10,000 yuan in copper coins were loaded onto the Shanghai Maru for export.</p>
<p>Shenzhou News Agency reported that after 12:00 PM yesterday, more than 100 Japanese and Korean rogues gathered in the "Japanese Hall" opposite the Huishan Wharf in Tilanqiao, Hongkou. Each person wore specially made clothes made of thick cloth, covered with large pockets, which were special tools used to carry copper coins to Japan. At about 2:00 AM, the more than 100 rogues were all equipped with copper coins, each person carrying about 5,000 coins, totaling about 17,000 to 18,000 yuan. They boarded the Shanghai Maru one after another from Huishan Wharf. Dozens of Japanese and Korean people were stationed along the way from the "White Book Hall" to the Shanghai Maru, and their security arrangements were very strict. After the first group of rogues arrived at the Shanghai Maru, they took over the first-class cabins as if they were high-class passengers. However, at 3:00 AM, just as the last group of rogues was boarding the ship, they were discovered by customs officers, who immediately stepped forward to stop them. The Japanese and Korean rogues then surged forward, surrounding all the customs officers and pulling out their pre-placed iron rulers, short sticks, and other weapons to violently beat the officers. Because there were only seven officers, they could not resist and were all seriously injured. Among them, three Western customs officers suffered particularly severe head injuries. After receiving notification from the customs authorities, the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai sent personnel to the port to mediate and first rescued the officers from danger. Then they ordered the rogues to hand over a portion of the coins. The rogues immediately handed over 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, which were loaded into two trucks and transported to the customs. All the injured officers went to the hospital for treatment separately. On the one hand, the situation was reported verbally to the customs authorities, and they waited for instructions. After this incident occurred, a reporter from Shenzhou News Agency visited Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, to inquire about the customs' opinion on this matter. According to Maze, he had not yet received a written report from the Commissioner of Customs, Bairunson, as of last night, so he was unwilling to express any opinion.</p>
<h3>The Changde Ship Ran Aground Yesterday, All Crew Members Left the Ship</h3>
<p>Ran Aground 21 Feet into the Reef, No Water Leaked into Any of the Cabins, The Company Urgently Telegraphed to Stop Them Yesterday</p>
<p>The Changde, owned by the Liyuan Shipping Company in Shanghai, has a deadweight of 2,662 tons, a length of 312 feet, a width of 40 feet and 2 inches, a depth of 24 feet and 7 inches, and a draft of 22 feet and 6 inches. On the 18th, it loaded coal in Qingdao and came to Shanghai. At 2:40 AM on the 20th, the ship arrived northwest of Sheshan, a distance of 20 nautical miles, that is, near Xiaoweishan. Due to the darkness and fog on the sea, it ran aground due to careless navigation. At that time, hundreds of methods were tried, but it was unable to escape danger. The shipowner issued a distress signal at 4:00 AM yesterday morning and telegraphed Shanghai for help. First, it was received by the pilot ship of the customs stationed in Tongsha, which immediately rushed to rescue. However, the ship was heavily loaded and had a deep draft, and it was trapped in the shallow water. The pilot ship tried hard to tow it, but not only did it fail to tow it out, but it also broke its own stern rudder leaf, fearing danger, it had to withdraw. At about 3:00 PM, the owner of the Changde ship continued to send two telegrams to Shanghai (briefly stating that after the ship ran aground, it was observed that fortunately there was no water leakage in the cabins, and all the crew members were still safe, and they hoped that a tugboat would be dispatched quickly to help rescue, etc. After receiving the telegram, the company immediately negotiated with the Ship Insurance Association and sent a tugboat to rescue. Just at about 5:00 PM, it received a third telegram from the ship, saying that the ship had run aground on the reef, more than 21 feet deep. Although the cabins on the ship had not been flooded, the wind and waves in the sea were very strong, and the waves were washing onto the bridge. The shipowner, a Russian named Gu Xun Chu Fu, believed that it had reached a very dangerous situation, so he reported to the Shanghai company that all the crew members had prepared to leave the ship and transfer to the pilot ship accompanying the ship, which would send them back to Shanghai, and decided to abandon the Changde ship, etc. At about 6:00 PM, it received a fourth telegram, saying that the crew had decided to abandon the Changde and leave the ship. The Shanghai company and the Ship Insurance Association were shocked by these two reports and believed that the ship's captain and crew's claim was absurd. As for the point of despair, the ship's cabins were said to have not taken in water, and the shipowner and crew were allowed to leave the ship without authorization and abandon the entire ship without regard. The company immediately telegraphed the Changde ship at 6:30 PM through the coastal radio station, urgently stopping the shipowner and crew from leaving the ship before it sank, and fearing that the crew members were not on the ship, it transferred the telegram to the pilot ship, notifying all the crew members to return to the ship quickly and wait for the rescue ship sent by Shanghai. At the same time, it contacted Leshiaoyang Company and dispatched a large tugboat, which was scheduled to sail to the rescue at noon today. The Ship Insurance Association also sent ship inspector Xu Zufan to the scene to inspect and assist in finding a way to rescue.</p>

<h3>Open Letter to All Workers in the City from the Agricultural and Industrial Life Improvement Association</h3>
<p>Adoption of Regulations and Solicitation of Members, Committee Appointed to Draft Work Plan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Agricultural and Industrial Life Improvement Association held its second preparatory meeting at the Xiaoximen Boy Scouts Association at 1:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Dai Youheng, Zhu Guilin, Xu Baoming, Lu Yinchu, Wang Xianqing, Zhang Sheng, Yu Zhenhui, Jin Yaoqiu, Li Weiran, Huang Rusong, Mao Xiaxuan, Wang Gang, Wang Youmei, Zheng Zhenchang, Zhu Chengtuo, Zhou Funong, Yin Yong, Jiao Simian, Hu Menglin, and others attended. Zhang Sheng was elected chairman, and Dai Youheng recorded the minutes. First, the chairman reported the approval of the registration with the Social Bureau, and then the discussion began: (1) The draft charter of the association was discussed, amended, and approved; (2) The open letter to all workers in the city was discussed and approved; (3) The solicitation of members was decided to end on April 15; (4) The determination of the work plan was decided to appoint Wang Xianqing, Zhang Sheng, Wang Gang, Lu Yinchu, and Lan Simian to draft it. The meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM. The open letter to workers is recorded below: Dear workers, our association is meeting you under legal organization. From now on, we will do our best to discuss and study with each other in order to strengthen agricultural and industrial production and improve the lives of agricultural and industrial workers. We will not just issue declarations and stick slogans on the streets, publicizing unfulfilled work on paper to deceive ourselves and others. We vow not to be brokers for our laboring comrades, but to sincerely shoulder the great mission of the labor movement, which is beneficial to the country and the nation. Reviewing the past labor movement and observing the current social situation, we have decided on the correct path for our laboring comrades in the future, contributing to the authorities and assisting them in realizing it as much as possible in order to stabilize social order and save the nation from danger. For nearly a hundred years, we have been subjected to the invasion and oppression of imperialist capitalism, which has sucked the blood and fat from the entire Chinese nation. It can be said that every class has been poisoned, resulting in national poverty and exhaustion, which is beyond remedy. Under these circumstances, we can only work hard and encourage each other in our respective positions. Dear workers, your lives are even more unspeakably painful. You work twelve or thirteen hours a day, and the wages you receive can only maintain the most basic living conditions for some, while others are even ill-clad and hungry. Families cannot support their parents, and children cannot be educated. When disasters, man-made calamities, illnesses, or deaths occur, it is even more miserable. Comrades, the sight of workers enduring hunger and starvation makes us unable to bear thinking about it any longer. But we must also say that are the hardships of laboring life are purely caused by the oppression and exploitation of capitalists? The simple answer is what we said above: "We have been subjected to the invasion and oppression of imperialist capitalism, which has sucked the blood and fat from the entire Chinese nation. "The painful moans of all classes are also unspeakable, but the suffering of laborers is more obvious. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "There are no capitalists in China. Compared with countries with developed foreign capital, there is only a difference between the great poor and the small poor." Then the workers are the great poor, and the so-called Chinese capitalists are only the small poor people. With the labor and capital classes of the great poor and the small poor, their nascent industries need to cooperate with each other and support each other in order to resist the invasion of industrial developers. How can we bear to kill and conflict with each other? Therefore, in a China with backward production, if we want to catch up, we must increase production with one heart and complete the mission of economic construction. This depends on the efforts of each individual in their respective positions, and even more on the laboring comrades and entrepreneurs working hand in hand. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "All the surplus value of industrial production is not solely the result of the labor of workers in the factory. All useful and capable people in society, whether directly or indirectly, contribute to production." Based on this principle, we believe that most useful and capable people will survive together if they unite, and perish if they separate. This is a certain principle. Recently, labor strikes have been rising and falling in the city. Shanghai is full of factories, the environment is complicated, and a slight misstep will have a great impact, not only hindering local public order and production construction but also suffering a major blow. We believe that labor-capital disputes are a normal symptom in countries with developed capital, but in our backward China, we should try our best to avoid them. Therefore, it is hoped that laborers will consider the difficulties of industrial constructors and take legal steps to request improved treatment. Entrepreneurs should also consider the painful lives of laborers, be sincere with each other, and provide as many opportunities for improvement as possible. Do not stubbornly adhere to prejudices, which may lead to the expansion of the situation and cause major social concerns. In short, the entire country has reached a final juncture. We cannot bear to see labor and capital fighting each other and failing to reach a settlement. To restore the country's fortune and revitalize the nation, we can only bury ourselves in hard work, coordinate labor and capital, be tolerant and understanding with each other in order to reach a bright and open road.</p>
<h3>Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association Forms Rural Credit Cooperative</h3>
<p>In the past two years, the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association has handled large-scale agricultural loans and established more than 50 production mutual aid societies, achieving excellent results and being praised by the general public. Recently, due to the start of spring plowing in various townships, it has specially worked with the Bank of China to continue handling loans and immediately began to organize production mutual aid societies into formal cooperatives in order to lay a preliminary foundation for rural finance. This work began on the 10th of this month. In addition to the specialists appointed by the association, the Bank of China has also sent Mr. Qian Qixiang to handle the work full-time, going to various townships every day to engage in publicity, meetings, organization, establishment, and reporting to the Social Bureau for registration, etc., without regard to wind or rain, which is commendable. It is reported that there are currently nine established cooperatives, including Wangjianqiao, Shishancheng, Tangjiazhaizhai, and Chenjiazhaizhai, etc., and seven or eight others are in progress. It is expected that about 30 cooperatives will be established by the end of this month. It is expected that loans can be started around April 15. The speed and clarity of the handling and the sincere cooperation of the people with the association are rare.</p>

<h3>Municipal Hospital Opening Soon, Yesterday Hosted the Press</h3>
<p>Li Ting'an Reports on Shanghai's Entire Health Plan, Weng Zhilong Reports on Service Details, Equipment is Excellent, X-ray is First in the Far East</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Hospital, after its construction was completed some years ago, and the various departments within the hospital were arranged, began accepting outpatients on January 4th of this year and inpatients on February 17th. The official opening ceremony is scheduled for April 3rd. With the official opening date approaching, the Bureau of Health and the hospital authorities held a tea party in the hospital's reception room at 3 PM yesterday to entertain the city's press. Li Ting'an, Director of the Bureau of Health, Weng Zhilong, the Hospital Director, and Wu Liguo, the Vice President, attended and delivered speeches and reports, and led a tour. Our reporter has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Li's Report on Health Plan</p>
<p>First, Director of the Bureau of Health, Li Ting'an, reported on the entire plan for Shanghai's health undertaking, briefly stating that since Wu Tiecheng became Mayor, more attention has been paid to health facilities. Shanghai's current health facilities are being carried out according to an overall plan. After the Songhu Battle in the 21st year of the Republic [1932], our municipal authorities actively constructed the city center area. In October of that year, the Bureau of Health planned the architectural design of the municipal hospital. By June of last year, the building was inspected and accepted. In August, a director was appointed. The official opening next month will mark the establishment of three health institutions in the city center area. The Bureau of Health will manage the city's health facilities, the municipal hospital will treat citizens' diseases, and the health laboratory will engage in chemical research and other work. In the future, specialized hospitals such as neuropsychiatric hospitals, leprosariums, and tuberculosis sanatoriums are planned to be established. If citizens have minor illnesses, they can go to the health clinics and hospitals in Huhang, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places for treatment. Patients with tuberculosis and other diseases will also have specialized hospitals to enter in the future. Those with more serious illnesses can come to the municipal hospital for diagnosis and treatment. According to the overall health plan, there are eight major affiliated buildings beside the municipal hospital, which will be realized sequentially based on the actual situation. Shanghai is a major port in East Asia, with international attention focused on it, so it is determined to make the municipal hospital's management perfect and seek benefits for the citizens. The hospital will also cooperate technically with National Tongji University in order to develop academics and career simultaneously. Therefore, we have infinite expectations for the municipal hospital.</p>
<p>Hospital Director's Report on Service Situation</p>
<p>Next, Hospital Director Weng Zhilong reported briefly, stating that the Municipal Government and Director Li aim to promote academics, so the municipal hospital is cooperating with Tongji University, one from the government's perspective and one from an academic perspective. Cooperation naturally takes serving society and benefiting citizens as its standpoint. The most important aspects of the hospital's operation are: (1) Emphasizing the courtesy of doctors, nurses, staff, and workers, because patients are sick people and should be treated with extreme gentleness; otherwise, even the slightest lack of courtesy can affect their health. (2) Making things as convenient as possible for poor patients. Therefore, first-class hospital beds account for one-tenth, second-class account for two-tenths, and third-class account for seven-tenths, charging the lowest possible fees and completely waiving fees for the destitute. (3) The Medical Advisory Department. The hospital has specially established a medical advisory department for consultations on academic issues, personal health, or public health. Whether inquiries are made in person or by letter, detailed answers will be provided, which is also an aid to health education. (4) The Social Services Department. A person's illness is related to their personal life, family situation, and social environment in every way. Therefore, treatment methods not only rely on medicine but also require attention to their life and environment. The hospital's responsibility to patients is not only limited to in-hospital treatment or ending after discharge. Regular follow-up visits should be conducted to provide relief or guidance, so that social pathologies can be made healthy, which is what our ancient saying "treat the disease, treat the body, treat the mind" means. In view of this, the hospital has established a social services department with the following objectives: (a) To conduct detailed explorations of the patient's personal, family, and social environment to supplement the tasks of diagnosis and treatment. (b) To promote the above work through investigation, research, and cooperation. (c) To implement relief measures, such as reducing or waiving fees for patients who cannot afford to pay, or subsidizing them with money or introducing them to jobs. (5) Training nurse assistants. The issue of medical care and service for hospitalized patients is of utmost importance. Because the hospital felt that this work could not be done by servants, it recruited nurse assistants and provided them with training. In addition to providing them with the necessary knowledge of medicine, it also provided them with reasonable guidance on etiquette. Last November, a recruitment examination was held at the Bureau of Health, with over a hundred applicants. As a result, 30 people were admitted. Training began on December 1st, teaching subjects such as physiology, anatomy, ethics, and ward work. After one month, practical training began in January of this year, with a plan to assess their fitness for application after two months of practical training.</p>
<p>Wu Liguo's Report on Construction</p>
<p>Finally, Vice President Wu Liguo of the hospital reported on the construction of the hospital, saying that the hospital building is a three-dimensional building that serves as the management office and medical school in the overall plan. Currently, it is only temporarily used as a hospital. It is 80 meters long and 16 meters deep, with six floors in the middle connected to the basement and four floors on both wings. The entire structure is made of reinforced concrete, with artificial stone for the exterior walls. The partition walls of the interior corridors are built with hollow bricks, and the interior partition walls are mostly made of fine wood strips for easy removal and remodeling in the future. The walls of the operating room, delivery room, and disinfection room are made of green tiles. The floors of each patient room are covered with rubber blocks, and the floors of the X-ray room and electrotherapy room are covered with rubber. The floors of the kitchen, dining hall, operating room, and each workshop are covered with polished stone. The patient lounges, reception rooms, and offices on each floor are all made of sandalwood floors. The layout of each floor is summarized as follows: the basement is for installing boilers, meters, machines, etc.; the first floor is for the lobby, reception room, general office, head nurse's office, pediatric clinic, obstetric clinic, dermatology and venereology clinic, X-ray electrotherapy room, social services department, medical advisory department, etc.; the second floor is for the surgical hospital; the third floor is for the internal medicine hospital; the fourth floor is for the pediatric hospital in the east and the obstetric hospital in the west, with the doctor's examination room and patient lounge in the middle; the fifth floor is for the kitchen, dining hall, etc. The hospital's overall plan includes nine main buildings, including two internal medicine hospitals, two surgical hospitals, one obstetrics and gynecology hospital, one pediatric hospital, one outpatient department and eye, ear, nose, and throat hospital, one nursing school and dormitory, and one management office and medical school. In addition, there is one pathology and drug research institute built by National Tongji University, one clinical classroom, and one student dormitory.</p>
<p>Tour of the Hospital's Interior Equipment</p>
<p>Finally, Director Weng and Vice President Wu led a tour of the hospital's internal equipment. (1) The hospital has a total of 181 beds, including 11 first-class beds, 22 second-class beds, 136 third-class beds, 9 intensive care beds, and 3 infant beds. (2) The surgical operating room has all the necessary instruments and sterilization equipment for surgical applications, especially the latest automatic surgical table and shadowless lamp. (3) The physical therapy department has a high-altitude sun quartz lamp, a Kolomeia quartz lamp, an Oken-style thermal light lamp, a Gaiffe-Erbe galvanometer, a short-wave diathermy machine, and a Sanatao X-ray machine. In particular, the X-ray therapy machine is the latest German product, sold to the Far East, and this is the first one. (4) The kitchen uses hot steam to cook rice, gas to cook vegetables, and electric stoves to cook liquids and soft foods, in order to avoid smoke from firewood and coal. When the food is cooked in the main kitchen, it is sent to the small kitchens on each floor by an automatic food delivery machine, and then distributed to the patient rooms by nurses. Both the main kitchen and the small kitchens on each floor are equipped with refrigerators and steam sterilizers. Utensils such as bowls, plates, spoons, and chopsticks are always steam-sterilized after each use. (5) The gauze and medical equipment used in the hospital are sterilized with high-pressure steam each time. (6) The hospital rooms use electric lights instead of electric bells for patients to call, and the management is very thorough.</p>
<h3>Old Gate Police Station Dectects Arson Group</h3>
<p>Organization Set Up on Dongxi Huade Road, Defendant's Bag Searched Out Seals, Westerner Hawkins Testifies in Court</p>
<p>The Old Gate Police Station recently received a tip-off that someone was organizing an arson group to defraud insurance money, so they conducted a strict investigation. As a result, Chinese detective Lu Gengsheng, detective Wang Yingjie, and Bao detective Zhu Shangwu, etc., successively arrested Chen Wentao (employee of Baohong Insurance Company), Wu Youfu from Jiaxing (also known as Wu Yingbai), Shen Zixiang (also known as Yin Boji), Zhou Wenwei from this city (employee of North America Insurance Company), Jiang Baoru from Zhejiang (employee of Weili Insurance Company), Zhong Wenbin from Ningbo (manager of Shenchang Insurance Company), Cao Yufu from Jiading (associate of Shenchang), and seven others. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, this case was brought up for trial in the First Criminal Court by Judge Qian Hongye. The defendants hired lawyers such as Fan Gang, Jiang Baoli, Lu Qi, Xiong Fei, Deng Jiabing, Huang Xiubo, and Ling Qihong to defend them. Many relatives and friends of the defendants also attended the court. First, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the defendants in this case were related to the arson that destroyed the building at No. 4, Lane 1024, Dongxi Huade Road on January 19th of this month, so they were prosecuted for arson and fraud under Article 173, Paragraph 1, and Article 339 of the Criminal Law. He presented the facts of the case in detail, taking over an hour. The following is a summary: According to lawyer Ru, the defendant Wu Youfu previously discussed arson with someone named Little Hu, who is currently at large, in order to obtain insurance money. At that time, Wu paid Little Hu 600 yuan as a fee for handling this matter. They then rented the house at No. 4, Lane 1024, Dongxi Huade Road for 60 yuan per month, and found a Gao couple to live in it, giving them considerable compensation. However, they did not have any familiar insurance brokers, so last October, Wu</p>
<p>Met Zhou Wenwei at the Tongyu Chun Tea House</p>
<p>Through Zhou's introduction, they entrusted Zhong Wenbin and Cao Yufu to insure 3,500 yuan in the name of Lu Yunfu with Weili Insurance Company, 3,000 yuan in the name of Cen Ziying with Weili, and 2,700 yuan in the name of Yin Boji with Baohong Insurance Company, all of which obtained insurance policies. Then, on January 19th, they carried out the arson. However, after the fire, the police suspected arson. According to the insurance company's regulations, policyholders who have suffered a fire must apply to the company for compensation within 15 days, so they ordered detectives to wait at each insurance company. However, as a result, no one applied to the company for compensation within these 15 days. It was only learned now that, two days after the arson by Wu et al., the Fuzhou Road Fanhua Clothing Company arson incident occurred.</p>
<p>The case was solved by the police</p>
<p>And severely punished by your court. All newspapers have records of this matter, so they did not dare to immediately apply to the insurance company for compensation. Baohong Insurance Company received a confidential letter before this incident, stating that the policyholders handled by Chen Wentao all had intentions of arson. The company paid attention to Chen and notified the police to monitor his actions, but because there were no flaws, they could not arrest him. However, on February 15th, a fire also broke out at the Dazhong Flower Factory at No. 1455 Huade Road, but it did not cause a disaster and was quickly extinguished. However, the fire brigade and the police did not receive a report, and the factory had fire insurance of 23,000 yuan with Baohong Insurance Company. This insurance was handled by Chen. Afterwards, Baohong Company sent Hawkins, a Westerner from Yunping Public Firm, to assess the value. Hawkins determined that the factory's loss was 166.2 yuan, but the factory's application for compensation requested 500 yuan. At that time, Chen Wentao visited Hawkins at Hawkins' private residence at No. 432 Hamilton Building and discussed with Hawkins, saying that he intended to have Dazhong withdraw the 500 yuan application</p>
<p>And change it to 700 yuan</p>
<p>Then have Hawkins re-evaluate it to 500 yuan, promising to pay Hawkins 100 yuan. However, Hawkins had been entrusted by Baohong to pay attention to Chen's actions, and the police were also monitoring Chen very closely, so Hawkins agreed to do so at that time. As a result, Baohong did issue a Macali Bank check for 532.2 yuan and handed it over to Chen to forward to Dazhong. On one hand, detectives tracked Chen Wentao. After Chen received the check, he immediately went to Macali to cash it, and then went to Hawkins to give him 100 yuan as a reward. At the same time, he also talked to Hawkins about the Dongxi Huade Road case, also asking Hawkins for help, promising to give Hawkins 500 yuan if it was successful. At that time, Hawkins needed to meet with the policyholder Yin Boji. On the 8th of this month, Chen led the defendant Shen Zixiang to Hawkins to meet, saying that he was Yin's representative. However, Shen was hired by Wu Youfu for 50 yuan to impersonate Yin Boji. Later, fearing that Shen would cheat, Wu, Chen Wentao, and Shen Zixiang went to Hawkins' home on November 11th and were arrested by detectives.</p>
<p>Copied Out From Shen's Bag</p>
<p>An Yin Boji seal, and a Cen Ziying seal was copied out from beside Wu. After confessing, Zhou Wenwei, Zhong Wenbin, Cao Yufu, and Jiang Baoru were arrested. The relationship between Jiang Baoru and this case was that he had been entrusted by Wu Youfu et al. to lobby Liang, a buyer from Weili Company, asking him to make this happen, promising to give Liang 500 yuan as a reward, and he could also get 100 yuan. Therefore, the police prosecuted him together. Next, Hawkins testified about the process of Chen Wentao's negotiations with him. After Judge Qian Hongye interrogated each defendant, he ordered that the case be adjourned for further questioning. Defendants Jiang Baoru, Zhong Wenbin, and Cao Yufu were each allowed to post a 500 yuan bail, and the rest were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Defamation of Xue Xiangyun Case, Wang Yongquan Sentenced to Six Months</h3>
<p>Verdict Announced in Court Yesterday, Wang Genbao and Xu Shi Were Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Xue Xiangyun, the daughter of the late dye tycoon Xue Baorun, had been married to real estate merchant Xu Liangchen for more than ten years and had no children. Suddenly, Wang Yongquan, the former chauffeur of the Xue family, requested in the civil court of the First Special Court to confirm that his son Wang Genbao was the illegitimate child of Xu Xue Shi. After the verdict, Wang Yongquan lost the case. Xu Xue Shi then hired lawyers Zou Sentang and Shen Pei to file a separate criminal case in the First Special Court, accusing Wang Yongquan and his son Wang Genbao of jointly defaming, instigating perjury, and defrauding money. After repeated interrogations, Xu Xue Shi obtained a review from the Zhenru Forensic Institute, confirming that Xu Xue Shi had indeed not given birth, as reported in this newspaper. At 2 PM yesterday, Judge Pan Zhenyang took the seat in the Second Criminal Court to continue the interrogation. After questioning Xu Xue Shi and the two defendants Wang Yongquan and Wang Genbao, the defendants filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The court ruled that the case was clear and ordered the debate to begin. The lawyers for both sides debated for a long time, and Judge Bo delivered the verdict in court. Wang Yongquan was found guilty of attempted fraud and sentenced to six months in prison. Wang Genbao and Xu Xue Shi were both found not guilty. During the appeal period, Wang Yongquan was sent to jail.</p>
<h3>Jade Art Pre-Exhibition Closed Last Night</h3>
<p>The pre-exhibition of jade art pieces for China's participation in the Paris International Exposition, which began on the 6th at the fourth floor of the Da Xin Company, ended successfully at 6 PM yesterday after fifteen days. In total, over the past half month, the number of visitors each day has been extremely crowded, reaching over 100,000. For the first ten days, there were many group visits, with people rubbing shoulders and hardly any room to move. Therefore, the exhibition was extended for five days and limited to individual admission tickets, so important figures in Beijing could leisurely observe the exhibition. The grand situation can be described as unprecedented. The various treasures are now being collected and packed. The three jadeite masterpieces are also being disassembled and packed into 30 boxes. The boxes are all made of mahogany and lined with velvet to prevent shaking. The box manufacturing alone cost 3,000 gold. The date of departure to France has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Tax Increase, Wholesale Price Increase</h3>
<p>Shanghai South Tobacco Exchange Store Requests Association</p>
<p>Please Tobacco Companies Distribute Tobacco According to Households</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Branch of the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association received a letter yesterday, jointly sealed by over 500 members, including Wanshengyuan, Dashun, and Chengchang, stating that they heard that the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance plans to increase the unified cigarette tax from April 1st, changing it to a four-tier system, adding 20% to the original amount of 50, 100, 200, and 400 yuan. After inquiring with various tobacco companies, they said that they had not received a clear document from the authorities, so it was difficult to confirm. Our stores purchased tobacco from wholesale stores on the 19th and 20th, and the prices had already increased, with inconsistent chaos. The price of each carton increased by 5 fen, 1 jiao, and 2 jiao, etc., and they could not be approved as usual. Wholesale peers could pre-order whole batches of tobacco for storage from the company, but our retail peers had money but no place to approve it, resulting in retail peers having no tobacco to meet the market demand, and business was greatly affected. Therefore, we jointly sent a letter requesting that your association quickly request each tobacco company to distribute a certain amount of tobacco to each member peer on a daily basis to meet the needs of retail customers, so as to maintain business and ensure livelihood. According to this, the branch held an emergency meeting at 4 PM yesterday. After public discussion, it was decided that (1) a letter should be sent to various tobacco companies such as Nanyang, Huacheng, Hexing, Zhongnan, Fuxin, Ruilun, and Yongtaihe, requesting that they distribute tobacco to each member store according to the household. (2) Members should be notified to send a responsible representative to the association office at the Dananmenkou from 8 AM to 9 AM on Monday (i.e., the 22nd of this month) to discuss the procedures for receiving the allocated tobacco. (3) Others omitted. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>

<h3>Wu Zhenjue Sues for Return of Wife's Coffin</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court Remands the Case, Wang Xiaoshu Taken Into Custody</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoshu, 33 years old, is an administrator of the Zhabei Charity Group. He previously seduced Wu Zhou Shi, the wife of Wu Zhenjue, a staff member of the Road Bureau living at No. 330, Lane 148, Shanzhong Road, and ordered her to abscond. In June of last year, Wu Zhenjue privately prosecuted Wang Xiaoshu for abduction in the local court. Judge Shao Qinzhi heard the case, released Wang Xiaoshu on bail, and ordered mediation to no avail, so he ruled that the case was not proven and declared Wang Xiaoshu not guilty, and rejected the plaintiff's private prosecution. Wu Zhenjue was unwilling to accept the fact that his wife was seduced and he lost the case, so he narrated the facts and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court for relief. After the High Court reviewed the circumstances, the first-instance judge's judgment was found to be inappropriate, so the original judgment was revoked and remanded to the Shanghai Local Court for retrial. Therefore, Chief Judge Cai Dingcheng opened the court for trial yesterday. According to Wu Zhenjue's statement, Wang Xiaoshu abducted my wife Wu Zhou Shi. My wife has not divorced me. My wife was abducted in June of last year. Now I hear that my wife is dead. During the first instance, Judge Shao persuaded us to mediate. Because Wang was a classmate, I considered the friendship of classmates, so I asked the judge to judge the defendant leniently, not for the purpose of money. Therefore, the judgment based on this was unreasonable, so I disagreed. Now I ask for a retrial according to the law, etc. To this, the judge asked Wang Xiaoshu to state that he had known and lived with Wu Zhou Shi since 1934 for three years, but Wu and his wife had already divorced. As for in July 1936, because the plaintiff came to snatch the divorce certificate, he went to the Public Security Bureau to investigate. Wu Zhou Shi and Wu Zhenjue divorced, which was certified by lawyer Fei Guoxi, so the plaintiff later withdrew the lawsuit. Wu Zhou Shi died of illness on September 14th of last year. At that time, I was not in Shanghai, and my younger brother entrusted the charity group to collect the body. To this, the plaintiff Wu Zhenjue stated that the divorce certificate was forged, and presented Wang's personal contract, and requested a judgment ordering the return of his wife's coffin and compensation for damages of 5,000 yuan, etc. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for investigation and retrial, and the defendant Wang Xiaoshu was taken into custody.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County Limits Deadline for Eliminating Opium; Implements Measures for Elderly Smokers</h3>
<p>Those Over Sixty Years Old: Three Warnings Will Be Given</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stipulating that elderly smokers should be given warnings in stages before being required to quit, urging them to voluntarily reduce their consumption. The original order stated: "Upon investigation, elderly smokers in various counties often suffer from physical weakness and multiple illnesses. Once forced to quit, other ailments often develop, endangering their lives, which is truly pitiful. However, setting a deadline for eliminating opium is a established government policy, and it cannot be altered due to a small number of elderly smokers. For the sake of reducing the pain and danger of the quitting period, smokers themselves should voluntarily and gradually reduce their consumption before being forced to quit. The smaller the consumption, the easier it will be to quit. If they can quit on their own, it will be even more appreciated by the government. This government is deeply concerned that many ignorant smokers lack the opportunity to become aware of this themselves. Therefore, it is stipulated that county governments should give elderly smokers aged sixty and above their first written warning six months before the quitting deadline, reminding them that the deadline is only six months away and that they should immediately voluntarily reduce their consumption in order to reduce the pain and danger of quitting. Two months later, the government will issue a second written warning, alerting them that the quitting deadline is approaching and that they should further voluntarily reduce their consumption. Two months after that, the government will issue a final written warning, urging them to reduce their consumption and comply with the deadline for quitting, so as to achieve the goal of eliminating opium by the deadline. Elderly smokers entering the rehabilitation center should be carefully cared for to facilitate the implementation of the prohibition policy. In addition to issuing separate orders, the county magistrate is hereby ordered to implement this earnestly, and the county hospitals or opium addiction treatment centers are ordered to comply." It is said that the county has already instructed the various opium addiction treatment centers to comply after receiving the order.</p>

<h3>A Major Fire Broke Out at Jihua Hall on Yunnan Road Last Night</h3>
<p>Fire broke out in the middle of the night; all employees were already sound asleep. Ladder broke, two people were burned and injured in falls</p>
<p>At 11:43 last night, a sudden fire broke out at Jihua Hall Pharmacy, located at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Six Malu. Although the entire Central Fire Brigade was dispatched to fight the fire, the result was that the decades-old store, with six large bays, was completely destroyed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Self-Made Products All Destroyed</p>
<p>The main branch of Jihua Hall Pharmacy in this city is located at the Yunnan Road intersection, with street numbers from 41 to 51, totaling six large bays. It is a giant in the Shanghai pharmaceutical industry, founded by Yuan Yaoqing from Zhenjiang. Since its establishment, it has had a very long history. In addition to its most famous self-made products such as Chicken Brand Yuan's Bone Pain Relieving Liniment and Bone Pain Essence, the store also sold products from major pharmacies and cosmetics, with extremely prosperous business.</p>
<p>Fire Extinguished After One and a Half Hours</p>
<p>At 11:43 last night, a fire suddenly broke out downstairs at number 51, the fifth bay north of the Central Cinema on the side next to it. The Central Fire Brigade dispatched all vehicles to fight the fire. It took one and a half hours to extinguish the fire, but the entire store was completely destroyed. Renji Shantang to the south and the Central Theater to the north were not affected.</p>
<p>Ladder Breaks, Employees Injured</p>
<p>The store closes at around 9:00 PM every night, so when the fire broke out, more than 20 employees in the store were already asleep. The most unfortunate incident was that the fire broke out downstairs at number 51, where the ladder was located. It was the first to break, causing apprentice Mao Yinchang (age 17) from Jiangbei and old clerk She Fufa (age 28) from Jiangbei to be burned and seriously injured in the jumps from the building.</p>
<p>Six People Escaped?</p>
<p>Firefighters rescued partners Wang Peisen (age 27) from Yangzhou and employee Wu Chunheng (age 29) from this city from the fire. All four were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to eyewitnesses, only six people were rescued after the fire broke out. According to the number of employees that the store had, being 20 to 30, it is still in doubt whether or not all the employees had gotten out as only 6 were seen rescued. Because the situation was chaotic at the time, it was impossible to investigate in detail.</p>
<p>Fragrance Filled the Air During the Fire</p>
<p>As for the cause of the fire, some say that the pharmaceuticals contained highly explosive substances, while others say that it was caused by an electrical short circuit. There are many rumors, but the police are investigating to determine the cause. Also, because the store sold cosmetics, a fragrance filled the air during the fire, causing more passersby to stop and watch. At the time of this newspaper's deadline, the fire had not yet been completely extinguished.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan and Others Telegraph Regarding the Tragic Situation of the Henan Disaster</h3>
<p>Hoping that Colleagues in Shanghai Will Do Their Best to Solicit Donations; Donating One More Yuan Means Saving One More Person</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Zhu Qinglan, chairman of the Relief Committee, and Mu Ouchu, Lu Bohong, and others departed from Shanghai last Tuesday to go to Henan for disaster relief. Zhu and others telegraphed the Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charitable Organizations in this city, which is raising funds for the drought in Henan, stating, "We arrived in Kaifeng this morning and met with Chairman Shang and others. We have a deep understanding of the tragic situation of the drought in western Henan. Many victims are eating vegetable roots and tree bark. The most severely affected counties number as many as twenty-seven. There has been no rain to this day, and it is impossible to plant seeds, causing immense suffering. The provincial government is indeed doing everything possible to provide relief, and the Relief Association is also enthusiastically working to benefit the disaster victims. However, the disaster is widespread, the population is large, and the provincial funds are exhausted. We deeply hope that colleagues in Shanghai will do their best to solicit donations. May compassionate relief and righteous aid come continuously, as donating one more yuan can save one more person. In addition to telegraphing Minister Kong to request disaster relief funds, we are telegraphing on behalf of the disaster victims, hoping for your consideration." Zhu Qinglan, Mu Ouchu, bowed.</p>

<h3>A Lawsuit Between Two Partners at Xu Chongdao's Tenth Branch Over One Dollar</h3>
<p>Colleagues Suing Each Other is Quite Absurd; The Case is Already Clear, and the Verdict is Scheduled for the 27th</p>
<p>Zhang Bin, a native of Nantong, age 46, the manager of the tenth branch of Xu Chongdao National Pharmacy, located on the left side of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the Second Special District Court, Criminal Division, accusing Yu Zhixiang, the director of the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Department in the same store, of two crimes: interfering with freedom and defaming reputation, requesting that he be investigated and prosecuted according to the law. According to the complaint, the court summoned both parties to the Criminal Division Two courtroom yesterday morning to be questioned by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. Both parties had lawyers present. The plaintiff claimed that he had been working at Xu Chongdao Pharmacy for more than ten years and had been the manager of the tenth branch for several years. On the fifth of last month, the defendant made phone calls at will without following store rules. The plaintiff stopped him with the shop rules, leading to an argument. The defendant then publicly said that the plaintiff had stolen one dollar from his Ginseng and Bird's Nest Department in the twenty-first year of the Republic, thus interfering with the plaintiff's freedom and reputation. The plaintiff requested an investigation and trial. The judge said, "You are colleagues in the same store. It is quite absurd to sue each other over one dollar." Zhang replied, "Although one dollar is a small matter, he said that I stole one dollar. Since I cannot gain the trust of others and cannot restrain the store's staff, reputation is the second life of a person. Since my reputation has been damaged, I cannot survive in society and must request a thorough investigation." When Yu Zhixiang was questioned, he testified that he had been the director of the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Department at Xu Chongdao for several years. "My business requires making phone calls. He (referring to Zhang Bin) unreasonably prevented me from making phone calls. In the twenty-first year of the Republic, one dollar was missing from my department, which is a fact that everyone knows. I never said that he stole it. His lawsuit is completely because he asked me for three yuan in illegal commissions every month. From the twenty-first year of the Republic until the end of last year, I paid him a total of 154 yuan. At the end of last year, I declared that I would stop paying. He held a grudge against me. On the fifth of last month, I was making phone calls. He used that as an excuse to stop me and fabricated accusations. I want to countersue him and request that he be prosecuted for false accusation." When the plaintiff was questioned about whether he had taken three yuan from the defendant every month, Zhang replied that it was a shop bonus and not an illegal commission. At this point, the court believed that the case was clear and ordered the closing arguments, then announced that the verdict would be announced at 9:00 AM on the 27th.</p>

<h3>An Old Woman Angrily Accuses Her Lover</h3>
<p>Zhu Shao Shi Is Heartbroken Over Lost Fortune, Zhang Changfu Abandons Old Love for New</p>
<p>Zhu Shao Shi, an old woman from Nantong, is 62 years old and lives at Qichang Zhan in Pudong. She has been a widow for a long time and has considerable savings. When she was 54 years old, she cohabited with Zhang Changfu, who was 44 years old. The old woman spent eight hundred yuan in cash on him and bought him clothes totaling more than one thousand yuan. Since July of last year, Zhang has not returned. When she went to look for him, she was driven away. Zhang also lured away and hid the old woman's young daughter. The woman was very angry and had run out of money, which made things difficult for her. Therefore, she sued Zhang Changfu in the local court, requesting that he pay her five yuan per month for maintenance for ten years, and return the one thousand yuan she was cheated out of, as well as return her daughter. The court was convened yesterday by Judge Wang Kequan. The defendant did not arrive. The judge ordered that litigation fees of 33.5 yuan be paid for a further hearing.</p>
<h3>An Employee Steals Blank Checks and Chops, Forging Them for Fraudulent Gain</h3>
<p>Shu Fushun Fraudulently Withdraws Funds; Wu Houbao Pays a Settlement</p>
<p>Shu Fushun, an employee of the Tonghe Meal Company located at 217 Wuchang Road, secretly stole two blank checks from the company between January 6th and February 1st of this year. He carved a chop of the owner, Cantonese Wu Huanan, and had his friend Chen Axiang withdraw a total of 922.3 yuan from the Yong'an Hongkou branch of the North Sichuan Road Bank. After fraudulently withdrawing the funds, he fled back to his home at 47 Yangmiaoqian in Hainanmen, Ningbo Town. After the incident, the Hongkou Police Station dispatched Detective Fang Fucheng, carrying a letter from the First Special District Court, to Ningbo to cooperate with the local Public Security Bureau. He was arrested at his address, and five yuan in cash, a gold ring, and a watch worth about 28 yuan were found on him. He was brought to Shanghai and handed over to Criminal Division Three. He confessed that he had spent 420 yuan of the money he had obtained on buying groceries, and that 500 yuan was deposited in the Shanghai Savings Bank at Xiaodongmen in this city, but the passbook was left in a suitcase in his Ningbo home. He was ordered to be detained and the hearing rescheduled. However, the funds in the bank were withdrawn by someone. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Bianfen convened court for further questioning. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that the defendant's relative, named Wu Houbao, had paid the plaintiff 300 yuan. The stolen goods bought by the defendant were worth over one hundred yuan and could be sold to obtain funds for compensation. The plaintiff's civil lawsuit was being mediated. For the public prosecution of forgery, he requested that the case be prosecuted according to the law. Judge Xiao questioned the defendant and learned that the Shanghai Bank passbook was indeed taken to Shanghai by his family to withdraw funds after he was arrested. The judge then ordered him to be detained again and scheduled a verdict. The stolen goods and property obtained from the stolen goods will be returned to the original owner.</p>
<h3>Pig Boat Capsizes in Wind</h3>
<p>Swift Rescue Prevents Sinking</p>
<p>The Shengruji pig boat from Liuliu Port in Jingjiang was loaded with fresh pigs. After going to Hangzhou to sell them and empty on the return trip, it was passing through the Wusongkou. At 9:00 yesterday morning, it was sailing outside the Erjia Water when it suddenly encountered a storm, causing it to capsize with the bottom up. The boat owner, Sheng Xiru, and five crew members were able to climb onto the bottom of the boat and avoid injury. As the boat was sinking, floating with the current, another cargo ship saw it and reported it to the Maoxing Tugboat Company. The company immediately dispatched the Tingyuan and Tianfu small tugboats to find it, and managed to turn the boat over and tow it to the Yuncaobang in Wusong for repairs. It is reported that the boat is sturdy and of great value. Fortunately, the rescue was swift, preventing it from sinking, which was a great stroke of luck in an unfortunate situation.</p>
<h3>Body of Murdered Man Found in Jinyi Road</h3>
<p>The male corpse, age about 30, found yesterday morning near the bamboo fence of the Sanfu Milk Stall in Jinyi Road, Xietu Road.

<h3>Young Woman Dies Mid-Journey</h3>
<p>The wife of Song Xiaolu, Song Xu Shi, a Hunan native, died near the Xujiahui Bridge in West Shanghai at around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. They had arrived in a rickshaw and planned to take a boat to Qingpu. However, after getting out of the rickshaw, the woman suddenly fell to the ground and died. A nearby police officer arrived and took Song to the station for questioning. According to Song, he was a member of the security team in Zhabei, and the deceased was his wife, a native of Qingpu, age 24. She had been living with her parents-in-law. She had become ill after a miscarriage, so they came to Shanghai to see a doctor at Caojiadu Hospital a few days ago. Her condition did not improve, and she had developed spots all over her body. Due to financial reasons and for ease of care, he was sending her back to Qingpu, but she unexpectedly died before boarding the boat. After hearing the statement, the police chief found the situation pitiful and ordered the local constable Zhang Qinpu to report the death to the court for examination. At 4:00 PM, the court appointed Prosecutor Yang to the scene for inspection. Because the family could not afford to arrange the corpse, the constable was ordered to prepare a coffin and temporarily store the body in a mortuary.</p>

However, it owes more than 700 yuan in wages to the typesetters, which has not been paid. On the 8th of this month, two of the newspaper's workers, Tong Deyue and Yang Zhaoyun, encountered Bai Luoji and his friends on Avenue Dubail near the Cathedral of Our Lady, and went up to demand the money, resulting in a conflict and argument. They started to fight, and as a result, Tong's eye and thumb were injured by Bai and his friends. They reported the incident to the police, who detained Bai and brought him to the Second Special District Court. After questioning by Judge Zhang Minsheng, Bai was ordered to pay a 2,000 yuan bond and wait for a rescheduled hearing. Bai did not accept the ruling and filed an appeal, also requesting the presiding judge to recuse himself. He even expressed that he would go on a hunger strike as a threat. It is now learned that the court has approved the request and changed the judge to Qiu Huanying. After questioning the defendant in Criminal Court Eight yesterday morning, he was ordered to be detained again and rescheduled the hearing for the 24th.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Government Bonds Still Being Pushed Up</p>
<p>Adopting the Speculative Tactic of Buying Near-Term and Selling Far-Term Contracts</p>
<p>Raising "Jin Chang" and "96" to Flank and Harass</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange still saw a forced continuation of the upward trend. Except for Category A bonds, all varieties saw new high prices again. The market price was so high, yet buyers did not consider it expensive. Various rumors circulated, but all seemed inconsistent with reality. In practice, it had little to do with the rise in government bonds. The reason for this rise was mostly due to the gold and yarn gangs imitating the methods used to push up cotton yarn prices. One party bravely bought near-term contracts, not hesitating to raise market prices to arouse the interest of the general public. The other party bravely sold far-term contracts, with the amount exceeding the number of contracts bought. The near-term contracts were prepared for delivery upon payment, while the far-term contracts were prepared for future physical delivery. This kind of maneuver only requires [missing text]. Therefore, the market price prospects from next week onward, with two days remaining in this month, it is feared that the market price will not be allowed to suddenly decline. After the end of March, the market price rise and fall will not be the concern of the manipulators, and it will be allowed to run its natural course. However, because a large number of physical goods are being delivered, the market price will naturally collapse due to the outflow of funds from retail investors. Therefore, the danger still lies ahead. Looking at yesterday's activity, in the morning opening, only Category E bonds saw a compensatory rise of 7 jiao and 1 jiao, and then immediately weakened, with a slight rebound, falling by 1 jiao to 4.5 jiao. Numbers 5, 10, 32, and 43 were sold. In the second session, the bulls again tried to push up prices, leaving no effort unspared. Except for the Category E bonds for this month, which rose by a small 4 jiao, the rest rebounded by 1 jiao to 4 jiao. However, the upward force was already limited. In the afternoon opening, they raised the price of Category E bonds for the far term, which suddenly rose by 7 jiao. Later, some retail investors naturally helped to raise prices. However, the sellers, fearing the strong buying sentiment, gradually withdrew, so the bulls did not need to push up prices any further. The front rows were slightly lower, and the back rows were slightly firmer. However, the bulls, fearing that morale was not strong enough and that their strength was already insufficient, engaged in raising the prices of "Jin Chang" and "96." "Jin Chang" soared by 3 to 4 yuan, and "96" broke through the 10 yuan mark again, flanking and harassing to confuse people. The danger of the future is also increasing day by day. The market price results showed a uniform increase of 2 to 3 jiao to 1 yuan. There was no change in Category C bonds for this month. The total transaction volume was 11,843,500 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan; transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Spot Sales Relatively Lackluster</p>
<p>Near-Term Yarn Plummets in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the momentum turned mediocre. American cotton, which had been soaring continuously, suddenly fell for three consecutive days, and the price of three-grade yarn also fell back. At the same time, although the spot yarn sales floor was not bad, it was less than the previous day. It has been found that the transaction volume has been as high as 25,000 to 26,000 bales in the past week. There may be a temporary pause. Therefore, the bulls took profits, and the market showed a slight pullback. However, part of the gold industry gang turned from short to long, and many Indian merchants also covered their short positions. As for the future situation, it should still depend on the actual demand for progress and retreat.</p>
<p>Future Marked Yarn Fluctuations Still Slight</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened in the morning, and the price of each month saw a slight decline due to the American variety falling for three consecutive days, and the price of three-grade yarn also fell. Unexpectedly, when the second session opened, the near-term market suddenly tightened, and retail investors were particularly eager to cover their positions. This was mainly because yarn sales had improved in recent days, and some gentlemen were holding on tightly. Therefore, the market was relatively firm, but the far-month was flat due to the impact of the overseas yarn and cotton market rebounding and weakening. The marked yarn results showed that the near month rose by 1 yuan to 1.1 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the far month fell by 0.9 yuan. The market situation was mixed when the afternoon session opened, and the situation was slightly frustrated. After the second session, the near-term price fell step by step. At the same time, the spot yarn business was not as strong as the previous day. It is said that Dafeng Factory sold 2,000 bales this month. The closing price fell more sharply, while the far month was still flat. As a result, the near month fell sharply by 2.1 yuan compared to the closing price in the morning, and April also fell by 1.2 yuan. The far month rose by 0.1 yuan and remained unchanged. Hengyi sold 1,100 bales, Hexing 5,200 bales, Gengfeng 2,950 bales, Changji 800 bales, Wang Taixing 3,800 bales, Taichang 1,250 bales, Yichang 3,100 bales, Mingde 4,700 bales, and Chengji 850 bales.

The highest and lowest market prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Volume Over 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>The spot yarn sales volume is still considered considerable. It has been found that the various gangs bought a total of 2,169 bales throughout the day, and the selling price rose by 1.2 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Plummets</p>
<p>Cotton Market Also Turns Downward</p>
<p>Sufficient Deliveries of Cotton This Month</p>
<p>The Trading Floor Is Full of Selling Voices</p>
<p>The cotton market continues to be weak due to the further decline in American cotton, which has fallen by 50 points compared to the high price. Indian cotton has also fallen sharply. The price of three-grade cotton has fallen even more severely. In addition, there are sufficient chips for delivery this month, and most of them are 16-count raw materials. The demand for this cotton is currently not strong from the factory side. Therefore, the market is even more depressed.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Falls Again with External Cotton</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened in the morning, and the price of each month continued to fall because American cotton continued to fall by 19 to 23 points, Indian cotton fell sharply, with 5.5 to 7.75 rupees, and Osaka's three-grade cotton fell by more than 1 yuan. Therefore, morale was slack, and in addition, there were sufficient chips for delivery this month. The marked cotton results showed that the price of each month fell by 0.15 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The situation was more or less the same when the afternoon session opened, and those who took profits covered their short positions. The market situation was firm, but later the market trend became weaker due to the lack of strength in the yarn market. As a result, the near month fell by 0.15 yuan compared to the closing price in the morning, and the rest rose and fell by 0.05 yuan. It has been found that Changfeng sold 23,600 dan, Jinghua 5,500 dan, Jifeng 2,800 dan, Zhenda 2,500 dan, Renfeng 2,000 dan, Taichang 8,900 dan, Hengchang 2,200 dan, Tonghe 3,500 dan, Yichang 2,800 dan, Changji 1,100 dan, Meiji 1,200 dan, and Yongda 1,000 dan.

The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Fine-R绒 Cotton Factory Purchases Still Smooth</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is slightly weak, but fine-绒 cotton is still in demand by factories. 904 bales were sold, and there were absolutely no arrivals at the docks.</p>
<p>American Cotton Bulls Continuously Liquidating</p>
<p>Difficult to Rise Without New Stimulus</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with a weak trend, with prices falling by 11 to 19 points. Trading activity in the early morning was sluggish. However, due to unfavorable foreign news, domestic and foreign bulls liquidated. Labor disputes and Washington's opinions on goods were difficult to predict, so the market price fell. Fellow traders and short-sellers bought in a considerable amount. However, the bulls continued to liquidate. Judging from the current situation, new stimulus seems to be needed to rise. In Germany, trading was very smooth, spot cotton was quiet, and the cloth market was sluggish. The closing price was flat and weak, with spot falling by 23 points and futures falling by 19 to 23 points. English cotton spot fell by 16 points, and futures fell by 13 to 14 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to bull liquidation, then firmed due to broker purchases, and finally weakened again due to short-seller selling. The price of Pingguoer fell by 5.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 5 to 6.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 7.25 to 7.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (19th telegram).</p>

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Rumors of Increased Unified Tax</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Cloth Becomes More Popular</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, Dongpi white goods continued to be extremely firm and expensive. The demand from the northern routes of Tianjin and Jinan was still good. Approximately 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, both spot and futures, were traded, with the price increasing by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan per piece. The Four Gentlemen broadcloth produced by domestic and foreign factories increased by 0.005 yuan per yard due to the strong sales in the north. The Tianjin and Shanxi gangs purchased more than 120 boxes yesterday, and the market price was 0.2725 yuan per yard. Japanese merchants lacked spot fine cloth and fine twill, and were unwilling to sell futures. In addition, there were rumors that the unified tax would be increased, and large traders padded their stocks, waiting and watching, resulting in the spot market becoming more popular, especially Yanghe, Longtou, Wufu, and Sanpai. In terms of actual sales, except for the northern routes, the rest of the regions were not active, and the Sichuan gang was the most sluggish, so the sales of blue cloth from various factories were also the weakest.</p>
<p>Summer Woolens Already Being Prepared</p>
<p>The sales of woolens were still strong yesterday. Large-volume goods had less trade due to the lack of activity in the retail stores in this street. Western-style clothing was in great demand, and there were large transactions in the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou routes. However, due to the short spring season, buyers are purchasing summer goods early, and the market atmosphere has changed greatly. The sale of spring-season herringbone woolens and other types of wool with deep colors and slightly thick flannel has become sluggish. However, the sales of French flannel, wool serge, "Barker" wool cloth, "Paris Venting" yellow twill, and other items that are not yet in demand are very strong, which is very different from the situation in previous years. Yesterday, Ruiven "Paris" sold for 4.5 yuan, Shililuo wool "Barker" sold for 4 yuan, and American Chen French flannel sold for 5.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Futures Flour Turns Stable After Falling</p>
<p>—Continuous Sharp Drop Triggers Short Covering—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a trend of first falling and then stabilizing in each month. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago fell by 0.91 yuan, Canada fell by 1.12 yuan, and Liverpool fell by 1 penny. When the opening price was quoted, the market was extremely uncertain due to the reverse drop in foreign wheat. Therefore, the opening price of this month once fell as low as 0.81 yuan. However, the continuous sharp drop in recent days was too large. Therefore, short sellers covered their positions smoothly, and the market became firm. The price of this month rose step by step, rebounding by 0.3 yuan compared to the initial opening. The price of April also fell slightly at first and then rebounded. The weather in July and August has already cleared up, and the market is exhausted. By the time the afternoon session opened, the transaction of this month was not very smooth, and the market had stabilized. There was only a 0.1 yuan fluctuation in April. In July and August, the market became flat and weak due to new short sellers. It is estimated that there will be only four days of trading for this month in the market. Since actual sales are still quiet, it should pass quietly.</p>
<p>This Month's Wheat Recovers Well After Short Covering</p>
<p>Yesterday, the daily wheat market was generally calm in each month. Although the foreign wheat quotations rebounded sharply, the long and short sides gradually approached each other in the near term. As soon as the shorts entered this month, it rebounded by 0.05 or 0.06 yuan. There was no change in April. Before there is certainty about the new wheat in June and beyond, trading is naturally limited, so the fluctuation is also limited. By the time the afternoon session opened, this month was still stable at first. However, due to the slight improvement in the recent flour market, customers covered their short positions, so this month was again raised by 0.02 yuan. In June and beyond, the weather is fine, and the far-term flour is also weak, so it fell by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. In the spot wheat market, the standard has improved, and the prices of each grade have also increased by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. The price of Kaitiantai wheat was 6.22 yuan, Jiangsu wheat was 6.32 yuan, the second grade was 6.27 yuan, and Guangshui wheat was 6.09 yuan. A total of 6,000 to 7,000 bags were opened and purchased by Fuxin and Shenda.</p>
<p>Customers' Indica Rice Sales Become Sluggish</p>
<p>Customers' indica rice has arrived in recent days, still seeing 10,000 to 20,000 bags per day. Only because the Guangdong gang's consumption is extremely greedy, the market has gradually expanded. Yesterday, Guangdong's demand was weak, and the eating price was particularly tight. Most of the cargo owners were willing to sell, and the market immediately turned flat and weak. If the consumption tomorrow and the day after tomorrow is still weak, the market may have to step down somewhat. Yesterday, Guangdong gang transactions were less than 2,000 bags. The northern ocean and northwest routes were only more than 1,000 bags. The rest were purchased by this street. However, this street's appetite is not as lively as it was a few days ago because the customer sales are not strong. The daily open sales of Jiangxi rice were 8,800 bags, Hunan rice was 300 bags, and Wenyong rice was 630 bags.</p>
<p>River Rice Price in Northern Shanghai Slightly Recovers Due to Clear Weather</p>
<p>(Southern Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for each gang was the same as before, still only 3,300 to 3,400 shi of goods from the 15th and 16th. Among them, thin rice was from the 11th and 12th. Although the arrival of goods was rare, the local sales were particularly weak, resulting in a soft situation and a decline in the market. In addition to the fact that the price of thick japonica rice was secretly adjusted by a few points, early rice depreciated by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The thin rice was also because the purchase by the gangs was not satisfactory. Only the Xi'an gang handled 800 to 900 bags, and the purchase price was relatively large. The market also fell by a corner. Judging from the future trend, it seems difficult to gain a foothold. The supply and demand of Dujian and Yinyuan is similar, all flat.</p>
<p>(Northern Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from various routes under the river was sparse, about the 12th and 13th. The sales of each goods in the market turned weak because the weather has turned clear. The store's appetite was loose, the market white japonica rice price turned a small 0.07 or 0.08 yuan, and the thin rice price was also soft. The Yangdu and Bujian prices were in a tired trend, the customer pointed was stable, and the prices of other goods were also in a tired trend. However, the arrival of 100 yuan goods was scarce, and the zero appetite was still possible, and the price was good by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake Sales Are Smooth</p>
<p>The soybean cake sales floor has continued to be strong in recent days, with South China being the main destination, and the mainland's intentions are also good. Because the Dalian market has risen more and fallen less, there is a unanimous bullish trend in the market. Yesterday, the total market was 80 pieces of Suifeng Factory's Four Brand Cake, 2,000 pieces of Changde Factory's Four Brand Cake, 2,000 pieces of Changji Factory's Four Brand Cake, 14,000 pieces of Dayouyu Factory's Four Brand Cake, and 5,000 pieces of Five Brand Cake. In addition, there were 5,000 pieces of Wuxi Hengde Factory's Four Brand Cake and 22,000 pieces of Changzhou Xiefeng Factory's Four Brand Cake. The delivery period was set for about ten days, and the market was slightly higher than the previous market.</p>
<p>Standard Soybean Cake and Oil Still Depressed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the standard cake and soybean oil markets were still lifeless. Although the Dalian telegram saw continuous step-building, the sales in Shanghai were very sluggish. In particular, there was ample arrival and storage of soybeans, and both the car factories and customer gangs lacked interest. Most of the trading houses and customer merchants intended to sell the standard, but the filling and hoarding were sluggish. The near month of the opening market was immediately down 0.06 or 0.07 yuan, and the far month was down 0.04 yuan. In the afternoon, the market stabilized due to the continuous telegram station, but this month was still constrained by the spot goods, and the closing price was still down 0.06 yuan, the next month was only down 0.03 yuan, May was down 0.01 yuan, and June was sold for 6.4 yuan, the standard cake was level in and out, and the closing price was not much different, Soybean oil had a lot of long liquidation, back to a small 0.15 to 0.05 yuan.</p>

<h3>Methods for Preparing Income Tax Return Forms (11)</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao, Pan Mingshan</p>
<p>(5) Report Form for Salary and Remuneration Income of Public Servants (with List)</p>
<p>Article 1 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that income from salaries and remuneration of public servants falls under the second category of income tax, which includes income from salaries and remuneration of public servants, freelancers, and others engaged in various occupations. All are taxed according to the tax rates stipulated in Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations. Therefore, in terms of the nature of the tax system, all salaries and remuneration, regardless of whether they come from public servants, freelancers, or others engaged in various occupations, are subject to income tax without any difference. However, in terms of the types of income earners and the withholding agents, there are differences. Also, there is a distinction when observing the source of tax revenue. Therefore, the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance has divided the income report forms and attached list formats stipulated for this type of income tax into three types: A, B, and C, as follows:</p>
<p>Type A: Report Form for Salary and Remuneration Income of Public Servants, Withholding List for Income Tax of Public Servants</p>
<p>Type B: Report Form for Salary and Remuneration Income of Freelancers and Others Engaged in Various Occupations (for Self-Payment)</p>
<p>(Note) This type of report form does not specify a list.</p>
<p>Type C: Report Form for Salary and Remuneration Income of Freelancers and Others Engaged in Various Occupations (for Withholding)</p>
<p>Withholding List for Income Tax of Freelancers and Others Engaged in Various Occupations</p>
<p>According to the above formats, public servants should use Type A report forms and lists for reporting and payment of their salary and remuneration income tax. This article explains the preparation method of this type of report form. As for Type B report forms and lists, due to the large number of inquiries from readers, their preparation methods have already been published starting from the 13th. In the summer of 1927, the Central Party Headquarters, due to the urgent need for funds for pensions for party members, created a system of income donations for service personnel, with the tax scope covering personnel of all agencies under the National Government whose monthly salaries exceeded 50 yuan. Those with 51 to 100 yuan were taxed at 1%. Those with 101 to 200 yuan were taxed at 2%. Thereafter, the tax rate increased by 1% for every 100 yuan increase in monthly salary, up to 8% for those with 701 yuan or more. Since the promulgation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and Implementing Rules, income tax for public servants was first levied according to law from October 1, 1936. This income donation was then abolished. Therefore, in terms of the second category of income tax, public servants shouldered the burden earlier than freelancers and others engaged in various occupations.</p>
<p>According to Article 1 of the Draft Collection Guidelines for this category (i.e., Draft Collection Guidelines for the Second Category of Salary and Remuneration Income Tax), the scope of public servants is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Personnel of party departments at all levels and their affiliated agencies.</p>
<p>2. Personnel of central and local governments and their affiliated agencies.</p>
<p>3. Staff and teachers of national, provincial, municipal, and county schools.</p>
<p>4. Personnel of state-operated enterprises.</p>
<p>5. Personnel of local self-governing bodies.</p>
<p>6. Other personnel engaged in public service according to laws and regulations. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Importance of Salt in National Defense</h3>
<p>— Chen Jingjian</p>
<p>Little friends! Did you know? If modern warfare is to achieve final victory, it must have the great power of the masses and sharp new weapons. This is almost universally known. However, some people neglect the storage of wartime military supplies, which are extremely important to national defense, and this is very dangerous. Remember, wasn't one of the main reasons for Germany's failure in the European War of 1914 the internal economic panic?</p>
<p>Now, let me first talk about the things that are urgently needed in national defense, military affairs, and people's food: salt.</p>
<p>The chemical name of salt is sodium chloride, which is a daily physiological necessity for humans. Because it strengthens vitality and the heart, the body will become weak without it. A few years ago, when the Red Bandits occupied Jiangxi, the authorities' implementation of a salt blockade was also a major reason for their success. It can be seen that salt has a close relationship with military affairs. In peacetime, our country's salt is originally sufficient for consumption, but the export of Changlu salt to Japan has resulted in a situation where the interior still has a light diet, which is very painful. Moreover, now we have reached a critical period. If we do not store enough salt and a war breaks out, once the coastal provinces are occupied or blockaded by the enemy's huge navy, then the lack of salt is foreseeable. Why don't we store it up first?</p>
<p>Secondly, electrolyzing salt is the main raw material for manufacturing chlorine gas, mustard gas, phosgene, and other toxic gases - sodium and chlorine. Although we love peace and do not produce toxic gases to kill the enemy, we certainly cannot sit still and wait for death when the enemy uses toxic gases. If poison gas invades, the only disinfection method is bleaching powder, and the most important raw material for manufacturing it is chlorine, which is also a molecule of salt.</p>
<p>Another component of salt is sodium. According to Soviet scholars, sodium and oxygen combine violently with water vapor, and the heat generated allows sodium powder to be used as incendiary bombs. Therefore, salt is also an important thing in military affairs.</p>
<p>In summary, salt is an indispensable substance for national defense in critical times. We should now store it as much as possible to cope with enemy invasions. This is an urgent measure.</p>
<h3>Body Temperature</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>One day, Min'er was careless and caught a slight chill in the morning. At first, it was just a cold, but later she developed a fever, and her body temperature unconsciously increased a lot. Her brother Cong'er wanted to know exactly how high her temperature was, so he put a thermometer under her tongue (this thermometer is not a thermometer for measuring the weather, it is specially for measuring human body temperature). After about four or five minutes, he took it out and saw that it was much higher.</p>
<p>"Brother, how high is my temperature? What is the normal temperature for a person?"</p>
<p>"You have a fever of about two degrees. Sleep well. A normal person's body temperature is between 36.5 to 37 degrees Celsius or 97.7 to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. You are now over 39 degrees, aren't you more than two degrees hotter?"</p>
<p>"How is body temperature generated? Why is the normal body temperature a fixed number?"</p>
<p>"You need to know that the generation of body temperature is like wood burning, which can generate heat. This is all because nutrients undergo oxidation in the human body, which can also be said to be combustion, because combustion is a type of oxidation. Therefore, the warmth in the human body is emitted by the oxidation of body components. Since warmth is generated in the body, it must be dissipated, which is the same as a stove needing a chimney. But there are three ways to dissipate body temperature: (1) dissipated through the skin surface through the air, (2) dissipated directly through the skin surface without air as a medium, (3) dissipated along with the moisture on the skin surface and the water vapor in the exhaled air. Isn't the moisture on the skin surface sweat? Isn't the sweat that just came out of the skin warm? Isn't the water vapor I exhale from my mouth also warm? The emission of body temperature changes with the state of the body, and the dissipation of body temperature also differs depending on the state of the body and the cold, heat, dryness, and humidity of the air. But our body temperature can often maintain a certain degree because there is a body temperature regulating effect that can maintain the amount of body temperature generated and the amount of dissipation, which is in a state of equilibrium. Because of this regulatory effect, body temperature will not be too high or too low and can often maintain a certain degree. If body temperature is too high or too low, then you will get sick."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Festival and Shanghai Children</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Today, March 21, is the "Shanghai Festival" designated by the Shanghai Municipal Government. In addition to warm celebrations throughout the city, various exhibitions are also being held to welcome the birth of the "Shanghai Festival." This indeed has profound significance and considerable value.</p>
<p>I remember Mayor Wu said at the Municipal Government Memorial Week last Monday: "We have established the Shanghai Festival with a very deep meaning, which is in line with the spirit of the times. We thought of using this Shanghai Festival to encourage industry, agriculture, commerce, and learning, to encourage citizens to be dedicated to their work, be gregarious, be loving, be united, help each other, cooperate, strive, produce, be lively, be optimistic, be progressive, and have upward-looking spirits and emotions, so that the entire Shanghai society and individuals will have a thriving atmosphere." These words are very sincere and worthy of our careful consideration.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that children are the roots of the nation and the future masters of the country, especially the children of Shanghai, who bear an even greater mission for the nation and the country. Therefore, on this Shanghai Festival commemoration day, all the children of Shanghai must deeply recognize that the Shanghai Festival is not an ordinary festival, nor is it a children's entertainment festival. The Shanghai Festival is the starting point for the children of Shanghai to begin diligently cultivating diligence in learning, love, unity, mutual assistance, cooperation, striving, production, liveliness, optimism, progress, upward-looking spirits, and virtues. So that the future Shanghai society can first establish a very solid foundation in the bodies of all the children in the city and gradually reach the realm of building a new Shanghai.</p>
<p>Children! Dear Shanghai children! I hope that from today's Shanghai Festival, you will accept the several excellent virtues indicated by Mayor Wu and strive to cultivate them. This is the true meaning of celebrating Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Egg Can Stand Upright</h3>
<p>— Cao Yiqiong</p>
<p>An oval egg can be made to stand upright! First, shake the egg vigorously to disperse the yolk and white. Then, use a bottle, any soda or beer bottle will do. Also, use two forks, insert them into a cork. However, one end of the cork must fit the tip of the egg. According to the picture, the egg can stand upright on the bottle cap. Be careful when playing this trick that the egg does not fall and break, because raw eggs will break when they touch a glass bottle or fall on the table.</p>
<p>Reason</p>
<p>This is because the yolk and white are heavier and sink to the bottom. Secondly, the two forks placed on top of the egg can balance the center of gravity. This is the same reason as a tumbler.</p>
<p>Distinguishing Raw and Cooked Eggs</p>
<p>Place four eggs on a plate, three raw and one cooked. Do not say in advance which one is cooked, so that people can distinguish between raw and cooked. This is originally very difficult. Now I have a method to teach you, which is to spin the four eggs one by one on the table with your hand. You can see that the one that spins very well is the cooked egg; the one that does not spin well is the raw egg.</p>
<p>Reason</p>
<p>The inside of a cooked egg is cooked and hardened, becoming a solid, so it can spin very well. The inside of a raw egg is liquid, so although the outer shell can spin, the liquid inside cannot spin at the same speed.</p>
<h3>Martial Games</h3>
<p>— Liang Guangjing</p>
<p>After the New Year holiday, the school had the first semester exams. One afternoon, after handing in the exam papers, I walked along Green Willow Road, intending to find a sunny place to study. I happened to look up and saw seven or eight children fighting on the dirt pile in Jie Shou Park across the bank. They agreed that whoever fell would immediately stand up. Seeing this group of lively little angels, so innocent and lovely! I asked with concern: "How did you do on the exam?" They replied: "Not bad!" Then they affectionately asked me: "May I ask what your surname is, sir?" I said my surname was Liang. After walking a long distance, they all shouted in unison, "Mr. Liang!" From this, I have two insights:</p>
<p>(1) Being with children brings an indescribable joy in spirit! Therefore, primary school teachers are nobler than middle and university teachers! (2) Elementary school lower and middle-grade students should do martial games - who says Chinese people love peace? Look at the children's martial nature! However, parents and teachers forbid children from fighting to avoid damaging their clothes! You should know that cultivating children's martial spirit is more valuable than clothes! Parents and teachers who care about small profits affect the decline of the Chinese national character!</p>
<h3>Patriotic Thought of Turkish School Children</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>Turkish school children must sing twice a week, and the songs contain phrases such as "We are Turks" and "We are honest and hardworking." Every Monday and Saturday, which are the first and last days of the week, all schools hold flag-raising ceremonies, even schools that teach foreign children and children of ethnic minorities, such as Jews, Albanians, Greeks, etc., must also perform this ceremony. During the ceremony, all students stand around the flagpole on the playground. As soon as the Turkish national flag is raised, all students sing the Turkish national anthem. After the national anthem is sung, they sing a pledge song, the meaning of which is "We should protect those weaker than us, we should respect the elderly. We should love our homeland and our country more than ourselves. Progress can improve the country's knowledge level, and we should make this our goal. Our existence depends on the existence of the Turkish nation. We should sacrifice everything for the Turkish nation, and if necessary, we should also sacrifice our lives." After singing, they salute the national flag, and then they carry their schoolbags home.</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>People cannot not read,</p>
<p>Nor can they read books to death;</p>
<p>Reading is originally for practical use,</p>
<p>Not just biting words and chewing phrases like bookworms;</p>
<p>We must find the source of life in books,</p>
<p>We must seek tools to save the country in books;</p>
<p>In addition to reading time, we must often go to nature to experience,</p>
<p>Go to nature to experience!</p>
<p>Go to nature to experience!</p>
<p>Verify and confirm what you have read in books.</p>
<h3>Kite</h3>
<p>— (Yang Zhigang)</p>
<p>"Eat melon seeds in the first month,</p>
<p>Fly kites in the second month."</p>
<p>Kite is also known as Feng Zheng, commonly known as Yao Zi. February is the season for flying kites. In this gentle spring breeze and warm sunshine, it is a very interesting game to hold a kite in one hand.</p>
<p>According to the research of physiologists, flying kites is said to be very hygienic, no wonder so many celebrities are advocating it, holding a kite competition in the east and a kite competition in the west.</p>
<p>The inventor of the kite is said to be Han Xin during the Han Dynasty. At that time, Han Xin persuaded Chen Xi to rebel against Han, promising to respond internally when he raised his troops; because he wanted to dig an underground passage to the Weiyang Palace, he created the kite, wanting to fly it high to measure the distance to the Weiyang Palace. However, whether this legend is reliable is still a question.</p>
<h3>A Set of Small Furniture (Handicraft)</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>...Made with three yarn cores...</p>
<p>Little friends, does your mother or sister use yarn cores when sewing clothes? When the yarn is used up, there will be a piece of wood left with high ends and a recessed center. It can roll around on the ground and is very fun to play with. Now, please collect them and accumulate three, and you can make a set of exquisite and small furniture.</p>
<p>If you don't have yarn cores at home, then go to a nearby familiar tailor shop and ask for three. They will definitely give them to you.</p>
<p>Now that you have the yarn cores, let's start with the table, which is the simplest: just cut a circle out of thick paper and glue it to one end of the yarn core, like in picture (A). Isn't it a very good small round table?</p>
<p>The second is to make a vase, which requires colors and paintbrushes: use them to paint some nice things in the middle section of the yarn core, flowers and plants, or landscapes. Then pick some green grass and insert it into the small hole in the center, and you have a pair of adorable vases (picture B).</p>
<p>Finally, make a chair, which is a bit more difficult, but not very difficult. Cut the shape of a chair back out of thick paper and glue it to half of the yarn core, and the chair is successful. Then find a small piece of cloth and a little cotton. Stuff the cotton into the cloth and sew it up on all sides to make a comfortable cushion. Put the cushion against the back of the chair (picture C), and the whole set of furniture is complete. Naturally, it would be even more beautiful to paint a darker color on the white surface.</p>
<p>If you show these three pieces of furniture to your father, mother, and sister, your father will definitely like the chair, because he thinks: how comfortable it would be to sit on such a chair and read the newspaper. And your mother will definitely like the vase, she loves flowers as much as her life, and she thinks this vase is good. Your sister, however, likes to do "algebra" on such a smooth little table. How great!</p>
<p>It's a pity that these three things are too small.</p>

<h3>Linlin and Beibei</h3>
<p>— By Xiaohui</p>
<p>(Explanation)</p>
<p>(1) Linlin and Beibei got lost while traveling in the countryside.</p>
<p>(2) A passerby said to them: Little friends! Come with me, I'll take you back.</p>
<p>(3) Linlin and Beibei followed that person.</p>
<p>(4) When they reached the beach, that person told Linlin and Beibei to get on the small boat.</p>
<h3>Arctic Explorers (2)</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>The ship he boarded was a large, square-rigged brig called the "Progress." The route he took was directly through the Davis Strait. When passing the Danish colony of Greenland, they hired an Eskimo youth, half of whom had been educated, to specialize in hunting. They also acquired a team of dogs to pull sleds across the ice during exploration. The ship stopped in Renfan Bay. This location was west of Smith Sound, between latitudes 79 and 80 degrees. The date was only September 10, but the ice had already surrounded it, making it impossible for the ship to proceed. On November 7, the sun made its last appearance (in the Arctic region, there is sunshine for half a year, and darkness for the other half, so from July onwards, the sky gradually darkens). From then on, it was dark for as long as one hundred and forty-one days. During this dark period, "even the dogs felt pain, because they were used to lying under the hatch, enjoying that line of light, but now they couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>Before the sun disappeared, Dr. Gann hurriedly sent people out to hunt for various foods and other useful things. Taking advantage of the fact that the ice had not yet broken, he planned to set off with a snow army, hoping to find the route to Polynia, which leads to the Arctic Basin. He thought that Franklin might be trapped in the basin. In early spring, the sun returned, and when the first rays of light were discovered in the sky, they resumed their search. On March 18, a sled loaded with eight people set off in high spirits. On the 29th, near midnight, Dr. Gann and the others left on the ship were warmly lit in the cabin and sewed their soft leather shoes. Suddenly, they heard a sound of footsteps above. After a while, three people, with swollen faces and exhausted, walked down, unable to say a word. It turned out that four of their companions had frozen in the tent and could not move, and another brave Irishman, Thomas Hogan, volunteered to risk his life, stayed there to serve the four with food and drink, while the three of them hurried back for help. Just because the journey was so arduous and exhausted, they had no energy to speak.</p>
<p>Dr. Gann's first idea was of course to set off immediately to rescue his companions. So he set up a sled, brought a small tent and some dry meat cakes, everything was prepared. Of the three, only Urson was relatively strong, so he wrapped him in a fur bag, wrapped his legs in dog skin and duck down, and tied him to the sled with a leather strap, asking him to be a guide. At that time, there were a total of nine people, including Dr. Gann, who resolutely set off into the icy world in the severe cold of 78 degrees below freezing.</p>
<h3>How to Be a Strong Child</h3>
<p>— Self-reliance</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the country. To create a strong country in the future, we must first create strong children now.</p>
<p>Nurturing and development are different. Nurturing only counts as doing one's duty, and development counts as achieving results.</p>
<p>The roots of trees are deep and the branches and leaves can flourish, and the bones of children are strong and development can be sound, so the first thing to pay attention to in nurturing children is to strengthen children's bones.</p>
<p>The elements of strengthening bones are calcium and vitamin D, which are very much needed during the period of children's development. If there is no extra supplement, development will be incomplete, or diseases such as rickets and dental caries will occur.</p>
<p>How to supplement these two elements to children? Now there is a kind of "Jiale Calcium" chocolate candy. The taste is the same as ordinary chocolate, but it contains appropriate amounts of calcium and vitamin D. Children eat one or two pieces each time, and several times a day, which can make the bones and teeth develop well, and the body is strong, creating the masters of the strong country in the future. (Go to Wuzhou Pharmacy to buy "Jiale Calcium".)</p>

<h3>Fourteen Inches Versus Sixteen Inches</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>According to a London report yesterday, the Japanese government will reject the "fourteen-inch" main gun caliber stipulated in the 1936 London Naval Treaty. Naval sources claim that even if this news is true, the United Kingdom does not plan to make any changes in the next three years. The opposition is because fourteen inches is still considered insufficient, and they advocate for a sixteen-inch caliber to be truly satisfactory. Although there is only a two-inch difference between fourteen inches and sixteen inches, the increase in firing power and the magnitude of destructive power are vastly different. It's not like buying cloth at a store, where you can easily add two feet to one foot. It is extremely important in terms of naval combat.</p>
<p>Therefore, the question of quality arises, which then affects the question of quantity. The London Naval Treaty stipulates that battleships should not exceed 35,000 tons, but 35,000-ton battleships are only suitable for mounting fourteen-inch caliber guns. If sixteen-inch caliber guns are mounted, 45,000 tons would be required. Thus, not only is the fourteen-inch caliber opposed, but even the 35,000-ton battleships are overturned. Therefore, The Times commented that if the main gun caliber is raised from fourteen inches to sixteen inches, the impact will inevitably lead to a country using technical reasons as an excuse to increase the battleship tonnage to above 35,000 tons, and naval shipbuilding competition will never end. This is a natural trend and need not be elaborated upon.</p>
<p>In fact, simply put, it is impossible to limit the arms race among countries with a mere piece of paper. Assuming the treaty stipulates a 35,000-ton battleship, but in reality, a 45,000-ton or even a 55,000-ton battleship is built, what can the signatory countries do about it? Take a recent example, the Treaty of Versailles was of utmost importance, but now Germany's military has been rebuilt, and the national flag of the National Socialist Party is once again flying on the banks of the Rhine. What can be done about it?</p>
<p>In short, the world today is a world of force, a world of arms competition, a world without justice or humanity. So-called treaties and alliances are mostly tools to deceive people and are completely useless. Now, one can only assess one's own national strength and manufacture sophisticated weapons. As long as you have the ability and talent, you can build eighteen-inch or even twenty-inch caliber guns if you want, who would dare to question you? Therefore, it is reported that the United States government intends to propose a peace plan at an opportune moment, with arms reduction as the main point. This statement was recently denied by President Roosevelt because the United States likes to do peace and compromise work the most. President Roosevelt may have this kind of ideal, but in view of the current arms race reaching a fever pitch, such an idealistic proposal would only be laughed at as foolish or pedantic, so he could only deny it.</p>
<p>As for limiting arms and reducing arms, there is inherently no such thing in the world. In a militaristic country, its military strength is certainly better the stronger it is, and no other country can interfere, nor will it allow other countries to interfere. Even other non-ambitious countries, each country has its own national policy and its own necessary military preparedness, how can they be restricted? For example, in ancient China, weapons included broadswords weighing eighty-two catties and spears weighing fifty-two catties. It all depended on each person's skill and strength. It is impossible to restrict combatants to using only a certain weight of weapon. For me to use a spear of a certain weight and you to only be able to use a sword of a certain weight, this is both impossible in reality and unnecessary in the situation.</p>
<h3>Gleanings from a Country Stroll</h3>
<p>— Jia Yi</p>
<p>Spring Suburbs</p>
<p>Dragging my weary mood, I left a corner of this tedious city and walked into another world. This accidental miracle was like a scene change on a silver screen.</p>
<p>Before my eyes was a field of lush green wheat seedlings, looking like a deep sea from the yellow soil; and when the cool spring breeze swept through, the verdant leaves gently swayed like ripples of green water, coming and going from afar, wave after wave.</p>
<p>Yellow wildflowers floated randomly. Although they have no fragrance and no alluring colors, they are enough to provide a pleasant touch to this vast expanse of green fields.</p>
<p>Full rivers and ponds, abundantly filled with spring water after the lingering rain, allow the willows by the river to reflect their graceful bodies, newly dressed in green-dotted spring attire. Several peach trees on the opposite bank, with budding blossoms, held a mouthful of smiles like young girls, perhaps thinking the willows were too charming! Yet, how could they know that the fallen petals behind them would be entrusted to the merciless flowing water!</p>
<p>What kind of food is falling from the clear sky! People only see that the withered land is now surging with the vigorous power of life. This power is infused into the veins of all creation, and invincible youth will break through the remaining power of winter, and the newborn universe expresses happiness as joy.</p>
<p>Although I did not see the swallows flying lightly, the spring scenery is too tempting with children holding kites in their hands.</p>
<p>Girls</p>
<p>Spring scenery is too tempting, stirring the souls of young girls. In the working fields, they even lengthen their own seedlings, and the weary work cannot restrain</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>this growing springtime heart. Their hearts, like willow catkins, flutter with the wind, who knows where they will land.</p>
<p>They are in groups of two or three, accompanied by women wrapped in headscarves, aged by life. Laborious and tired mothers have perhaps forgotten the springtime in their children's hearts! She shouts:</p>
<p>—Hurry up and watch, it will be late soon.</p>
<p>The girls gave a deep, lazy stretch, raising their weak arms, their arms were numb and about to collapse.</p>
<p>Those washing clothes by the river should be reflecting their rosy faces! When pairs of swimming fish swim past their eyes, this provocation is even more unbearable! ... But they only wish their father a good business tomorrow, bringing back a pair of fashionable shoe uppers…</p>
<p>From the tall chimneys that spew out blood-sucking black snakes day and night, a miserable sound howls. Yet another group has been released: some with pale yellow faces, others painted with urban extravagance – alarmingly colored red lips and powdered faces. Some have learned love songs from female students, others curse their fate like pear blossoms in the rain.</p>
<p>The youth of the country girls fades away before the spring scenery has ended! When female students wearing light spring dresses and their lovers walk past their eyes hand in hand, smiling.</p>
<p>Barren Graves</p>
<p>What are those piled up mounds? I can't help but think that they are barren graves!</p>
<p>On the bun-like clods of earth, no spring breath is evaporating. Only withered and broken grass stalks are sadly dying! Yet, the surroundings are all green! This division of life and death saddens me!</p>
<p>In these two worlds, who can say that is happiness? An old man who just walked to the barren grave, I saw him staring deeply at the grave with extremely sad eyes. This silent gaze is so poignant. He carried his heavy burden and finally walked away weakly.</p>
<p>The people in these barren graves, like their living descendants, spent their lives with the land. They painstakingly grew vegetables, picked clean every night, and carried them on their shoulders to the city every morning (at that time, the city people were having good dreams!). But the price they got could not buy their children a salted fish or a pair of socks!</p>
<p>The ancestors vented their anger on their children, whipping their livestock with willow branches; the children also retaliated on their own children in the same way. Work harmed the spring of their lives, and the land gnawed away their withered blood. When they leave with their hands empty, what they leave behind is still a piece of land that wears down life.</p>
<p>Successive generations of poverty, the fate of poverty. The accumulation of barren graves is increasing on the land! The land is their god of life, but also their fatal demon. Their process in the world is only to look up at the fiery lights on the horizon in front of the coffin-like hut on the nights they stop working, unfolding their comforting fantasies!</p>
<p>The old people are approaching their ancestors' graves, but the young people are stubbornly growing their youth. When the roar of the land boils, the sleeping people in the barren graves will see what a smiling face their descendants have!</p>
<h3>Memories Under the Bridge</h3>
<p>— Harris</p>
<p>Last night I wandered on the lonely Sichuan Road Bridge. When I came back, I had a strange dream, as if I had returned to my distant hometown. I crossed the quaint Zhuxi Bridge, and I could see the door of my long-lost home.</p>
<p>It was like early morning, or perhaps dusk, everything around was hazy. My eyes, as a returning wanderer, were also hazy. But, I grew up in this countryside, and I will never forget that there are fertile fields, green hills, and gurgling streams here. How could I not recognize my peeling, bronze-colored door, and the red paper couplets on the door—the door was not bolted, and it opened with a creak as soon as I pushed it.</p>
<p>"Who is it? A frail and weak voice asked."</p>
<p>Oh, isn't that familiar voice my old grandmother's? She hobbled out, and who else could it be but my old grandmother with her kind and elderly face? She tried her best to open her old eyes and looked out the door… then my shadow appeared; I clearly saw her body stiffen… I hurried forward and opened my mouth to her with a trembling call, and then helped her into the house.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you send a letter first… I was wondering why I hadn't heard from you for so long! Your return is so sudden! Oh, let me see, you left home at thirty-one, and now it's been a full nine years. Thank God! You've become so strong and tall, just like your father… Good, you sit here, let me light the lamp." Muttering all the way, we went to the hall together. My old grandmother struck a match, but it was immediately blown out by the wind. So she struck a second match and then lit the lamp with an extremely trembling hand. Under the yellow firelight, I gazed wistfully at my old grandmother; and I was surrounded by a noble warmth. My old grandmother finally smiled and said, "Thank God, you've grown up so well!"</p>
<p>"Where's Aunt?" I asked. Because I felt lonely.</p>
<p>"She went to the city to see your cousin's illness. She probably won't be back tonight. Have you had dinner? Let me cook you some dinner!"</p>
<p>Grandmother was too old, I said, and I really wanted to see Uncle Qing next door at the moment, maybe I'll eat there</p>
<p>Uncle Qing's house was on the other side of the bridge, and it took less than ten minutes to get there. With the same shock, this honest middle-aged man received me. But I was surprised to meet Uncle Qing's daughter, Ah Hui, here; wasn't it said that she had already married and become a mother? This beautiful childhood companion.</p>
<p>Dinner was eaten at Uncle Qing's house. Fearing that it was too late, and I was really a bit tired, I said goodbye and came out. There was a rustling mountain breeze and insects chirping in the fields. The moonlight in the sky was very clear; but the water in Zhuxi was even clearer. When I leaned on the bridge railing and looked at the water, what I saw was the gurgling water; flowing, flowing, reminding me that the water I saw here in my childhood was also flowing like this.</p>
<p>And my childhood was like flowing water, I don't know where it flowed to! What was left was this memory on the bridge.</p>
<p>In the memories under the bridge, there was Ah Hui with two braids. When we were young, we climbed hills all day long, ran in the fields, and watched the flowing water on the bridge. When we got a little older and understood some of the ways of the world, I once asked her:</p>
<p>"Hui, what are you thinking about?"</p>
<p>"I'm thinking that the water keeps flowing, and our childhood will one day flow away; what will we do then?"</p>
<p>I was embarrassed at the time and didn't answer; and now, nine years later, the reality has given the most cruel answer: Ah Hui is already someone else's wife, the mother of two children, and I am a single man wandering around the world.</p>
<p>This incomprehensible life!</p>
<p>When I woke up from the dream, it made me even more painfully aware that I was still staying on a strange sea, and I hadn't even returned to my hometown once—my wandering life has been going on for nearly ten years</p>

<h3>Aftersound</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications (1300) will have Mr. Lu Zhixue of Wuzhou Pharmacy lecture on "The Relationship Between Sulfuric Acid Industry and National Defense and Chemical Industry" from 6:40 PM to 7:00 PM today. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention at that time.</p>
<p>The "Song of Spring", a world-famous song published at the end of last month in the "Chinese Harmonica World, Volume 3, Issue in the Famous Song Column" of the Chinese Harmonica World Monthly Magazine, 157 Anren Street, Xinbeimen, this city, was composed by F. Mendelssohn and adapted into a harmonica piece by the famous Chinese harmonica expert Bao Mingshan. Since the publication of this song, it has been enthusiastically welcomed by readers from all over the country, who have sent letters and telegrams to the magazine requesting Mr. Bao to personally teach the various playing methods and expressions, strengths, weaknesses, and musical terms of the song on the radio. Mr. Bao, unable to refuse the enthusiasm, has agreed to broadcast on the Youlian Radio Station (frequency 880) from 5:40 PM tomorrow (Monday). In addition, at the request of listeners who love harmonica music from business and academic circles outside the city, the director of the Wenlian Radio Station has specially agreed with Mr. Bao to change the teaching time from 4:10 PM to 4:30 PM every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon to 5:40 PM to 6:00 PM from tomorrow. Please pay special attention to the readers who love harmonica music so that they can listen and study on time.</p>
<p>The Lingying Opera Troupe is a newly emerging group specializing in singing majestic songs. Since broadcasting, it has received good reviews from the outside world. Now, in order to expand its operations, the troupe is recruiting several female members and a violinist (both male and female are accepted, and those who can volunteer are qualified). Those who are interested in joining the troupe can write to the Lingying Opera Troupe, 876 Zhoujiazui Road, Hongkou.</p>
<p>Movie</p>
<h3>Hardworking Proofreader and Field Reporter Zhao Dan's Performance in "Crossroads"</h3>
<p>Old Zhao is an unemployed intellectual. He lives in a corner of the city, in a simple and dirty apartment, and still owes the landlord several months of rent. His life is so difficult that he can't continue, and his heart is very anxious to find a job and survive. He runs around outside every day, but in the current situation where there are more people than jobs, selling one's intellect is still not an easy task.</p>
<p>As a result, one morning, he received a letter from the postman, which brought him good news. He has a job. He is a proofreader in a newspaper. Although the remuneration is so meager and the position is so low, it is still a great opportunity for him. From then on, his life may be a little more stable.</p>
<p>He happily ran to the newspaper. Although the work was so busy, he only focused on doing it. Whenever he had free time, he also studied writing articles. By chance, the editor-in-chief discovered his writing talent and assigned him to be a feature writer and field reporter. Holding two positions, he was really too busy to breathe, but he still worked desperately. He ignored the ridicule of his colleagues. His answer was:</p>
<p>"I won't die anyway. I think it's always better to have something to do than nothing, and it's always better to have food to eat than nothing..."</p>
<p>Friends! What a painful statement. For the sake of "living," we have to work. How about you?</p>
<h3>The "1939 Drama Society"</h3>
<h3>Will Stage "Sunrise"</h3>
<p>The script has been approved by the Social Bureau</p>
<p>Xia Xia, Mei Xi, and Sun Jingjun Participate</p>
<p>The "1937" newly emerging drama society, born with the 1937 drama year, has been preparing for a long time. Originally, they planned to stage Mr. Ling He's "Black Hell" as the script for their first performance, but later, because the play failed to pass the review twice, it was temporarily put on hold; on the other hand, they immediately submitted Mr. Cao Yu's "Sunrise" for inspection, while working hard on the play's technical aspects.</p>
<p>Two days ago, not only did the complete four-act script pass, but the actors were all talented people on the stage. Such as Xia Xia, Mei Xi, Gao Buxiao, Sun Jing, Manna... etc., and the role of Little Thing in "Sunrise" has also found considerable talent to play it, who is Shu Xiuwen's sister, Shu Na.</p>
<p>Director? The first is of course Zuo Ming; at the same time, they need more people to direct them. With such a wealth of talent, the theater is about to explode again!</p>
<h3>Grand Theater Presents "Adorable Wildcat"</h3>
<p>New Production Starring Child Star Shirley Temple</p>
<p>Shirley Temple's acting can be considered among the best of the Hollywood child stars. Her previous works have been very popular and have garnered much praise. Now, her latest masterpiece, "Adorable Wildcat" (The Little Colonel), is being shown at the Grand Theater. In the film, Shirley Temple plays an innocent and mischievous young lady who repeatedly causes trouble within the Navy Department, making the Admiral dizzy and causing the entire crew of sailors to laugh until their teeth hurt! However, she inadvertently uncovers a spy's plot and performs a remarkable feat for the Navy Department. The content is both serious and humorous, with songs and dances, and it can truly be considered Shirley Temple's unprecedented masterpiece.</p>
