<h3>蕰藻浜南岸主力血戰敵突圍南進痛予擊潰</h3>
<p>血戰一晝夜敵深入達三公里　我增援包抄反攻恢復原陣綫　敵潰退沿浜一帶無再犯能力</p>
<p>中央社云、本社江灣隨軍記者、十二日晚九時報告、被圍於薀藻浜南岸之敵、前昨兩日向東西突擊、希圖衝出重圍、經我軍擊退後、本日天明前改變計劃、以縱深配備向南突擊、其進犯方式、一成不變、先以大砲猛轟、繼以步兵衝鋒、向我陣地猛撲、至晨四時許、血戰開始、敵藉其强力火器着着進壓、我軍堅忍應戰、相持至天明、敵機又加入助戰、勢甚兇猛、卒為其突圍深入、南進達三公里、至九時我左右翼由兩側猛襲、正面部隊亦經增援反攻、咸冒砲火彈雨、反覆衝擊、戰况之烈、為八一三以來所罕見、實為薀藻浜南岸之主力戰、我軍不屈不撓有進無退之精神、卒博得完全勝利、血戰至下午五時、卒將敵擊退、敵軍狼狽潰竄、遺屍遍野、現退集沿浜黑大黃宅、八房宅、楊宅一帶、雖仍作最後頑抗、但其實力為我消滅殆盡、已無再犯之能力、而全在我軍控制之中、其殘部之解决、指日可待、又在顧家宅方面、敵不斷由北岸砲擊我陣地、而江家宅方面則一日之間、衝鋒突圍有五六次之多、惟經我嚴密監視、迄未得逞、敵渡河進犯大埸南翔主力完全擊潰、計劃至是全部失敗、一週來以薀藻浜南岸為中心之大戰、亦可告一段落、</p>
<p>中央社江灣隨軍記者、十二日晚十一時報告、敵軍自六日偸渡至薀藻浜南岸、𪋉集黑大黃宅八房宅楊宅一帶、連日經我圍擊、殘部已僅剩二千餘人、乃十日晚起、敵軍又於陰雨連縣中、陸續偸渡、兵力驟增至一師團之衆前綫並推進至黑大黃宅前一公里之壩石橋宅、昨晨拂曉、以大塲為目標、全力進犯、來勢極猛、我軍陣地被其突破一點、敵軍竟推進三公里、至九時、我軍增援雄厚兵力、由正面反攻、同時兩翼奮出夾擊、兩軍發生主力激戰、至下午五時、將敵主力完全擊潰、殲滅殆盡、造成滬戰以來空前未有之大勝利、現殘敵退處浜邊、已潰不成軍、我軍刻正乘勝努力殲滅中、</p>
<p>薀藻浜南岸、昨日竟日在慘烈血戰之中、昨晨被圍之敵、竟突圍而出、傾全力向劉行大塲公路我軍之陣地進犯、企圖衝至大塲、同時為避免公路正面我軍雄厚之兵力訐、敵軍並不在公路正面進犯、而向公路西側小道衝來、在敵軍密集砲火之下、及坦克車猛衝之中、果被敵軍突破數點、然情勢並不嚴重、於是我軍立下全綫反攻之令、向其左翼猛烈攻擊、以壓迫其右翼之後退、衝鋒肉搏、我軍此起彼仆、奮勇撲擊、殺敵無算、敵軍傷亡異常重大、其企圖進衝大塲之右翼、遂被迫不支後潰、我左翼乘勝推進、仍將敵軍擊退至薀藻浜沿岸、殘敵憑隔河砲火之掩護、據守黑大黃宅一帶、苟延殘喘、昨晚竟夕、在劇烈之血戰中、我軍正努力於消滅敵軍殘部、同時我軍右翼向沿岸敵軍反攻、昨亦有相當進展、</p>
<p>黑大黃宅激戰頗烈</p>
<p>中央社云、敵軍自六日渡過薀藻浜後、戰事重心、卽在其南岸展開、敵軍偸渡者為唐橋·石駁岸等河身較狹之處、而集結於黑大黃宅·墻門頭宅一帶、背水為陣、由公路迤西、長達二公里許、其地距大塲約四公里、我軍最先為嚴防敵軍與東楊宅方面渡過之一部、取得聯絡起見、由滬太公路綫向敵猛烈進擊、而在正面則略後退、該敵前進、加以包圍、敵為避重就輕、故於日前向西南冒然推進、一度進至壩石橋宅、前夜起、我生力軍開到、卽猛烈反攻、一聲令下、我軍個個奮勇、直撲敵陣、敵雖恃其密集之砲火、向我轟擊、其奈我軍咸抱必死决心、前仆後繼、有進無退、終將敵軍擊潰、遺屍六十餘、向北退去、右翼我軍亦乘勢進攻、以為策應、敵受嚴重壓追、集結於黑大黃宅、趙家角、墻門頭宅一帶、昨午五時許、據前方報告、黑大黃宅等處、仍在激戰中、謠傳敵已進估大塲之說、亳無根據、</p>
<p>敵殘部向唐橋潰退</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者十二日晨九時四十五分報告、前由江家宅渡至薀藻浜南岸之敵、經我軍奮勇兜擊、加以三面包圍、昨夜猶圖突圍而出、澈夜以猛烈之砲火、向我陣地轟擊、企圖破毁我工事、繼卽以全力猛攻、惟經我軍迎頭痛擊、激戰半夜、敵始不支、向唐橋方面潰退、今晨拂曉、敵又蠢動、我軍卽以機槍密集掃射、幷以手溜彈猛擲、敵迄未能越雷池一步、至報告時、尚在激戰中、又在顧家宅方面之殘敵、今晨拂曉、又經我軍一度進擊、予敵重創、敵伏居村內、不敢出擊、我軍决予痛懲、全部肅淸、卽在旦夕、</p>
<p>施相公廟雙方炮戰</p>
<p>中央社廣福隨軍記者十二日晚十一時報告、廣福以北至曹王廟全綫、連日因天雨積水、行軍不便、故無激戰、惟敵軍頻以大砲向施相公廟以北至曹王廟間我軍陣地猛烈轟擊、但我方工事則未有重大损毁、我亦還擊、而北豎溝南之蕭家宅敵曾來犯、一度被其突破警戒綫、旋經我軍反攻收復、現全綫無變化、</p>
<h3>廣福鎮南北有激戰</h3>
<p>敵犯孟家宅周家宅被擊退</p>
<p>廣福鎮東南二公里許之孟家宅我軍陣地、昨日有大隊敵軍向我進犯、敵軍在密集砲火下、向我攻擊殊烈、我軍奮勇迎戰、與敵周旋、卒將敵擊退、午後、敵軍增援又來、激戰甚烈、昨晚通宵未息、今晨據前方消息、敵已後潰、</p>
<p>中央社云、敵軍昨又向廣福鎮北周家宅我軍陣地進犯、我軍在敵猛烈砲火下、雖有相當犧牲、但仍扼守原有陣地、繼得生力軍增援、卒將敵擊退、敵亦有重大損失、</p>
<h3>敵圖瀏河登陸慘敗</h3>
<p>敵受重創狼狽潰退　昨仍不斷砲轟沿岸</p>
<p>中央社云、沉寂已久之瀏河口、前日又有敵砲艦等二十艘、運輸艦十七艘、集泊該處、由瀏河口至七丫口、首尾相接、長達十二哩、我駐軍據報、卽嚴密警戒、至前晚六時許、敵艦卽開始以密集砲火、向沿岸一帶轟擊、繼有敵軍分乘汽艇多艘、在砲火掩護下、向岸駛來、圖在馬喬·楊林·七丫·陸浜各口岸登陸、我軍屛息以待、俟其駛近、機關槍手溜彈一時齊發、敵慌亂異常、中彈落水者甚多、且有已涉水近岸、兩脛陷於沙灘中、不及趨避而飲彈斃命者、敵受重創後、知不可犯、卽狼狽潰退、昨據報告、敵艦仍不斷以大砲向岸轟擊、其登陸企圖、似未放棄、惟我江防鞏固異常、敵如再犯、决難得逞、</p>
<h3>閘北江灣敵受重創</h3>
<p>我軍反攻三路擊敵獲勝　燬敵車二輛斃敵數百人</p>
<p>中央社云、閘北隨軍記者、十二日午十二時半報告、廣東街·東寶興路等處巷戰、忽斷忽續、至今晨三時、敵死傷達百三十餘人、始完全退去、我軍旋於四時許、天未啟明、實行拂曉玫擊、一路在譚家宅、持志大學、粵東中學、由水電路出擊、向愛國女學進攻、一路則由廣利路抄出、攻六三花園敵軍側面、同時我八字橋方面、亦由柳營路襲出、猛撲日本墳山、敵坦克車多輛、則在江灣路上往來發砲、掩護其步兵頑强抵抗、惟我軍此起彼伏、神幻莫測、敵軍應付不及、至晨九時、敵死傷已達百五十餘人、旋以敵機出動、我軍卽退守各據點、戰事始止、又江灣方面、來犯敵軍、至晨五時牛已完全被我擊退、是役我平射砲發揮火力、燬敵車二輛、並斃敵六七十人、</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者、十二日晨九時四十五分報告、昨夜迄今晨、敵數度進犯我復旦大學、兩江女體、江灣跑馬廳、及南天祿寺等處我軍陣地、經我奮勇迎擊、予敵重創、終將共擊退、至廟行方面、我軍正面陣地、自昨夜至今晨、並無接觸、前綫頗為沉寂云、中央社云、本社江灣隨軍記者、十二日晚九時報告、江灣跑馬廳北之八字橋宅、為我軍該綫重要據點、本日淸晨、敵忽猛烈進犯、一度為敵佔據、經我反攻收復、敵竟又增援不斷再犯、一日之間、我失而復得、達四次之多、雙方損失均重、至晚敵以力竭退去、不敢再犯、</p>
<p>中央社閘北隨軍記者、十三日晨零時三十分報告、昨午敵機二十餘架、在閘北上空盤旋投彈、此去彼來達四小時、投彈不下一二百枚、其目標仍為共和路、寶山路一帶、近晚敵機離去後、我軍卽加緊戒備、嚴防敵軍進犯、至十時、廣東街虬江路口、果見敵坦克車往來活動、我軍為先發制人計、故不待其進犯、卽由前哨以手溜彈猛擲、而我機槍隊亦由後趕到、向敵掃射、忽斷忽續、相持約半小時、敵約一中隊在其坦克車之掩蔽下匐伏前來、我軍卽躍出衝擊、巷戰約一小時敵遺屍二十餘、終無結果而退、中央社江灣隨軍記者、十三日晨零時三十分報告、據探報、昨午四時許、高境廟附近嶺南中學方面、敵軍調動甚忙、且有坦克車二十餘輛、在該處活動、我軍以敵在薀藻浜南岸進犯覆敗、或將在該處進擾、故加以密切注意、旋於六時許、泗涇球塲及張奚宅方面之敵、突向我賀家巷陣地進犯、我軍一面沉着應戰、一面由葉家花園出擊、襲敵左翼、經我數度我衝擊、至九時許、敵因受壓迫、在機槍隊之掩護下、稍行後退、我軍隨敵推進、至十時半在徐涇橋張奚宅一帶互相對峙中、迄報告時激戰未已、</p>
<h3>敵機大肆轟炸閘北</h3>
<p>浦東滬西等處投彈頗多　南市各處又散荒謬傳單</p>
<p>昨日午後一時起、敵重轟炸機十餘架、分三架一隊、在閘北大肆轟炸、每次投彈均為三枚、直至五時許仍未駛去、總計所投炸彈、竟達百枚左右、實屬滬戰以來第一次所見、至彈落之地點、以橫浜河沿岸·及虬江路·寶山路一帶為最多、惟因其畏我高射砲射擊、未敢低飛、僅凌空亂投、因之投彈雖多、我除民房受損外、軍事上則無若何損失、</p>
<p>昨日二時至五時間、閘北砲火及敵機轟炸未停、商務印書館東面之鐵路綫、虬江路與路軌交叉處、江灣車站、及大塲等處、投彈極多　又川沙輕便鐵道附近、及中央造幣廠、下午有敵機投彈、當時有八人受傷、</p>
<p>昨日下午四時許、敵機四架、盤旋滬西極司非而路浜北、及閘北潭子灣一帶、擲彈十餘枚、潭子灣一帶房屋頓時起火、尚有二巨彈落中央造幣廠後面空地上、死一人、傷二人、該機擲彈後、卽向東飛去、</p>
<p>敵對浦東我軍銜恨切骨、昨日自晨至晚、終日派機不斷投彈轟炸、但因漫無目標、大多落於田間、僅少數民房被燬、此種暴行、純圖報復我砲兵給予彼方之重創、然我軍事上實未受損也、又下午三時浦東楊家渡·張家浜·東昌碼頭·一帶、有敵機三架、投彈三四枚低飛偵察、幷用機槍掃射、</p>
<p>昨日下午三時許、敵機三架來南市、散發荒謬傳單、先在城廂上空盤旋二週、繼卽飛往高昌廟·龍華等處窺探、卽向滬西中山路折北飛去、敵以軍事上之不利、而欲以此煽我民衆、斯種舉動、實無恥之尤矣、</p>
<p>昨日下午五時許、敵機在閘北大肆轟炸、戈登路浜北大隆鐵廠內中一炸彈、當時炸傷該廠工人四人、廠屋一部分被炸燬壞、受傷者送入寶隆醫院醫治、</p>
<h3>敵機轟炸赴禾難民</h3>
<p>死傷難民共五十餘人</p>
<p>中央社云、上海慈善團體聯合救災會戰區難民救濟委員會、前日遣送難民一千餘人、乘大安輪赴嘉興、由該會遣送股派余作階護送、昨日下午、該會接余君由嘉興來電報告云、(上略)已刻、大安輪到禾在洋關外、敵機炸傷難民約五十餘人、已死一人、傷船夫三人、輪明晚回申云云、會方正副主席屈文六·黃涵之·兩氏聞訊後、對難民傷勢、極為關懷、當卽電復、如是項受傷難民、在禾無醫院可收、請急救後、仍由原船送滬醫治、</p>
<p>交通界息、昨晨敵機又四出肆擾、九時許、轟炸機三架　飛至嘉興投彈、該處第三難民收容所、中彈被燬、斃難民甚多、詳情待查、無錫附近戚墅堰、及蘇州外跨塘兩處、亦有敵機騷擾、各投彈三數枚、損失待查、本市方面、則淸晨起、卽有敵機六架、不斷在浦東投彈、並指示敵艦砲擊目的、近午、敵機五架、在租界北首、盤旋不已、我軍以高射砲轟擊、巨彈爆炸聲、與高射砲聲、隆隆不絕、全市震驚、</p>
<h3>昨砲戰終日未息</h3>
<p>敵砲無標的僅損民房　出雲艦移動畏我砲火</p>
<p>敵砲亂轟漫無標的</p>
<p>中央社云、昨日停泊浦江中之敵艦、終日向浦東作漫無標的之射擊、其中尤以停泊九號浮筒之敵砲艦發砲最多、其目的在浦東招商局華棧一帶、致該棧及附近民房中彈起火、延燒甚久、敵機三五、亦不時結隊在該處上空窺察投彈、</p>
<p>出雲移動避我砲火</p>
<p>我浦東砲兵陣地、於國慶日砲轟楊樹浦敵軍陣地、予敵重挫、並擊燬敵艦二艘、建立殊勳後、昨晨迄晚、泊黃浦江敵艦、不時以疏稀之砲火報復、我軍佯作不睬、敵徒事耗去無謂彈藥耳、前晚九時起、雙方互轟至昨晨四時、益趨激烈、幾於每秒鐘有砲響、聲震全市居民咸從夢中驚醒、至六時始漸停、但不時仍各發砲、直至九時後、始不聞砲聲、事後據華東社記者向軍事機關探悉、前夜砲戰、為抗戰以來所罕見、總計敵方發砲約六百至七百發、我方亦達三百餘發、我因發砲目標凖確、敵陣受創頗鉅、當四時許砲戰激烈時、泊浦江敵旗艦“出雲”號曾向下游移動三百米突以避我砲火、直至昨晨六時半始駛回原泊地、</p>
<p>滙山碼頭中我砲彈</p>
<p>昨晨砲戰正烈之際、匯山碼頭方面、有敵援軍一千餘人登陸、不意竟遭我砲彈擊中、常塲卽有數十名敵軍被炸身死、此外尚有一彈、落於該碼頭東面彈藥集中處、亦卽爆發、全部軍械、頓被燬滅、故昨晨砲戰之結果、敵方損失異常重大、事後敵方惱羞成怒、無的放矢、每隔數秒鐘卽向我方開砲二響、以圖洩忿、但因其標的毫無、於我無絲毫影響</p>
<p>敵艦戰馬同受損毀</p>
<p>申時社云、十一日晨楊樹浦及匯山碼頭一帶、到有敵運輸艦四艘、裝來大批軍用品、在深夜起卸、當被我浦東砲隊偵悉、乘其在卸貨之時、突以重砲向之猛轟、擊中敵艦二艘、並毁其軍用品甚多、楊樹浦及虬江碼頭敵方戰馬千餘匹、亦被擊斃數百匹之多、</p>
<p>可熾鐵廠無端受累</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>中國當盡量運用自己的優點</h3>
<p>— 韜奮</p>
<p>中國是一個弱國，這就某種意義上說起來，是相當正確的，尤其是在工業落後及軍備尚未充實方面，有着較明顯的流露，但是就民族解放的鬥爭的立場上看來，中國却也有它的優點。在事實上，我國一直到現在，還未盡量運用我們自己的優點，這是非常可以痛惜而需要猛醒的一件事情。</p>
<p>這優點是什麼？我以爲是具有深刻民族意識的偉大的民衆力量。但是這偉大的力量至今還在潛伏着的狀態中，好像有無量金礦寶藏似的，還深深地埋藏在地下，未曾開發出來，未曾被我們盡量運用起來。在我國也許還有人對這個偉大的力量還糊裏糊塗，或者有意熟視無賭，但是我們的民族敵人似乎已在担憂着，所以對於我國的政府與民衆之間，大發揮他們的挑撥離間的作用。例如日本的近衛首相最近還再三聲明日本對中國的軍事行動只是要膺懲中國的南京政府與軍事領袖，至於天眞而善良的中國民衆並非日本的敵人。我們誰不知道，中國政府對日抗戰，正是反映全國民衆的迫切要求，全國民衆因爲發動了對日抗戰，對政府愈益擁護得熱烈；我國全國上下是在一致團結對付我們的公共敵人——日本帝國主義者。但是日本帝國主義者一定要施用種種伎倆來把我們的民衆和政府分離開來，這就因爲他們看出中國偉大的民衆力量之可怕，一旦被中國盡量運用起來，是他們所難於應付的。我們的敵人對於我們的這個優點千方百計地摧殘，這是無足怪的，但是我們自己如縱任這個‘寶藏’埋在地下，却是一件很可痛惜的事情。</p>
<p>我們的這個優點是侵略國所欲得而得不到的。日本帝國主義向中國開始進攻以後，他們的政黨還公開要求日本政府說明對華用兵的理由。據最近由日本回來的朋友，還說在日本有不少人問起為什麼要到中國來打仗！他們不是沒有民衆，但是在少數軍閥和財閥所發動的軍事侵略之下，雖用盡麻醉的手段，壓追的方法，民衆的力量還是喚不起來。被侵略的中國，情形便大不同了。我每日替抵抗三日刋拆閱無數讀者來信，看到他們愛國的眞誠，願爲國家的抗戰遭受任何犧牲而無悔的表示，未嘗不深深地受到感動，同時也感覺到政府動員民衆的工夫還太不夠，以致有許多有志爲國努力的民衆都陷入投效無門的苦悶境域，因此愈益深刻地感覺到中國至今還未能盡量運用自己的優點。</p>
<p>我記得梁任公曾替李鴻章作過一篇傳記，說李鴻章可以自豪的是甲午之戰，日本不是打中國，打的是李鴻章。這在李鴻章，以一人和一國打仗，也許可以自豪，但是在當時的中國，以一人的失敗而貽國家以無窮的禍患，不可說不是中國國家的一慕慘劇。這幕慘劇的遺禍於中國，流毒至今，未曾消失。當時日本强迫李鴻章親自到日簽訂求和條約，有人說這是有意侮辱李鴻章的，但是割地賠款却是中國國家的莫大損失。這次我國整個民族和日本帝國主義抗戰，形勢當然和李鴻章時代不同，但是在當時日本所與作戰的好像只是李鴻章一個人，現在日本所與作戰的好像只是中國的二百萬軍隊！我要特別鄭重提出這一點，因為依事實上的表現，實際上和日本作戰的只是軍隊，只有軍事上的動員，其他部分雖已漸漸地在那裏發動，但是在這樣緊急的時期，這樣迂緩，這樣缺乏整個計劃，這樣散漫，是絕對不夠的。我們有急起直追，趕緊補救的必要。</p>
<p>我們有四萬五千萬的偉大的民衆力量，這是事實，但是如不盡量運用，那也只是一個空的數量，仍然不會發生實際的效用。我們有着這個優點——擁有偉大的民衆力量——爲我們的敵人所不及，這也是事實，但是如不盡量運用，有若無，無異消滅自己的優點，替敵人消滅一種顧慮，這在民族利益方面，實在是一件罪大惡極的罪惡！這事如不急圖切實的補救，日本在甲午時候只須對付李鴻章一個人，在現在只須對付我們的二百萬軍隊，這危機實在値得我們的嚴重的注意和深刻的認識。</p>
<p>中國如眞要作持久戰，如眞要獲得最後的勝利，必須盡量運用自己的優點—現在還在潛伏着的而未被積極開展的偉大的民衆力量。</p>

<h3>在轟炸中来去</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>一口皮箱，一𡄜被捲，被淳如處長命人搬進了首都飯店，於是暫時便把自已的身子寄頓在那兒的二百十四號室裹。飯店純依西式經營，室內亦相當潔凈。有浴室這正投我所好，便入浴一次，掃蕩我兩三日來身上所積蓄的塵垢。</p>
<p>在潔白的磁盆中想到了古人所說的‘齋戒沐浴可以祀上帝’，我覺得我們中國人在古時候似乎是最愛潔凈，最重視沐浴的民族，對於沐浴一事竟賦予了宗教的情操。曾點的“浴乎沂，風乎舞雩”，深得了孔夫子的讚獎，大約也就是出於這同一的情操吧。但這在印度和歐洲的中世記却是兩樣，儘管宗教儀節異常嚴重，而沐浴是被視爲了罪惡的。據說浴時和浴後都發動人的淫思。這心理和我們的民族心理似乎有點兩樣。不過我們的民族後來也不愛潔凈了，同樣也有以浴沐爲撥發淫興的習氣，不知是否受的西方的影響。</p>
<p>不管他，我究竟是中國人，重視浴沐的遺傳因子仍然在我的血液中流着，我是喜歡浴沐的，據我自己的經騐，浴沐之後儘可以减少人的雜念，使自己的身心都振作了起來，不好放肆。就譬如一张潔白的手巾吧，你自己初拿到手時，總是不好隨便污穢它的。故爾浴沐之後，必然地伴以心齋，我是這樣地感覺着。有了這樣的感覺，就要和上帝見面，似乎眞可以泰然，雖則我自己並不相信有什麼上帝</p>
<p>浴後，坐就南窗下的書案，給上海的友人寫了兩封信。雨是早住了，但天氣是昏濛的。起伏着的紫金山在西首靜峙着，有一高峰突尖鋭，頗類日本的富士。略略動了一下登臨的興趣。但也想到應該做的事體還多，這種閒情，僅如微麗一抹而已。</p>
<p>腸胃仍然是不甚舒服，早食旣未用，中飯亦不想進，便率性實行了斷食的齋戒。</p>
<p>室中是有雙床的，我佔領了一張，倒上床去略略休息了幾刻鐘，醒來時已快午後一時了。早上由淳如處長早已約定，在午後一時當去訪錢慕尹先生，不一會，淳如也就坐着汽車來了。</p>
<p>慕尹先生是第一侍從室的主任，我們的見面這回還是第一次。第一次見面，覺得慕尹先生的身體很魁梧，而氣象却雍睦。我把辭修寫的介紹信交給了他，同時也把由上海來時何香凝先生所委托的慰勞蔣先生的一大包絨綫編物也點交了。彼此略略談了一些客氣話，於是便告辭了出來。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>不討好的日本外交</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>“事實最雄辯。”那些仰承着軍人鼻息的日本政治家。為要證明侵略行為的正當。無論怎樣用盡了心力。制造着歪曲的外交理論。推行着詭譎的宣傳政策。終究是徒勞無功的。</p>
<p>據中央社所發表的新由東京來華的某外籍觀察家的談話。“日本此次對華侵略。勞師無功。人民怨恨。軍部威信掃地。乃歸罪外交。攻擊外務省不能盡責。致使日本軍隊血肉犧牲。反遭國際斥責。外相廣田極為狼狽”云云。誰都知道國際對於日本的斥責。是鐵一般的侵略事實所惹起的。日本早就拋棄了國際信義。其外交官員的任何花言巧語怎能轉移國際的視聽呢。可是日本軍人面對了我國意外堅强的抵抗。當然是不會如此想的。日本的外交大臣眞是太可憐了。</p>
<p>上述那一種政治軋礫的現象。是戰爭發展的必然結果。我們可以預料在日本方面。戰爭愈持久。軍部的紙老虎愈戳穿。國際地位愈孤立。而國內危機也愈嚴重。至於我國方面則恰巧相反。戰爭愈持久。民族光榮愈昭彰。國際地位愈提高。而國內團結也愈鞏固。</p>
<p>最後勝利必在我方的眞理就在此。</p>
<h3>隨軍日記（五）</h3>
<p>— 中央社特派隨軍記者陳萬里</p>
<p>十月九日</p>
<p>陰沉的天空、不斷地飄着雨絲、看不到日常慣見的飛機、聽不到日常慣聽的跑聲、除了滴滴的單調的雨聲、大地像死樣的靜寂、</p>
<p>戰事雖然還在薀藻浜的沿岸繼續地進行、可是其他各綫都很平靜、祇有哨兵的警戒槍聲、偶然打破這死寂的空氣、</p>
<p>在這裏只要跑出房屋一步、便都是一片泥漿深深地沒着脚背、濘滑到使人不能站住、在這種“寸步難行”的情况之下、常常使我想到戰壕裏的水、雨水中的人、和在泥濘的田野間的肉搏、……這些這些、不斷地在我的腦中幻現、眞的、祇要想到大雨中的前綫的將士、雖然泥水常常浸透了鞋子和兩脚、我總覺得我是太幸福了的、</p>
<p>今天又看到許多敵人的步槍和鋼帽、這些東西是我們常常得到的戰利品、聽說敵軍的步兵、只要和我們的步兵稍有接觸、他們便丟了所有的東西爭先逃跑了、步槍是他們第一件失了的東西、所以便成了我們得到的戰利品之大宗、</p>
<p>十月十日</p>
<p>這幾天的晚上都睡得很酣、因為沒有飛機和砲聲的攪擾、今天早晨醒來、已經七點半鐘了、看到雨絲還在繼續不斷地打着、悶沉的天氣、並沒為了我們的國慶而晴朗、但是我的心坎裏、却還充滿了陽光、十分愉快和興奮、</p>
<p>我們和敵人多少年來的血賬、到了今天的雙十國慶、都已開始了淸算、敵人第四次的總攻、限令在今天之前、佔領我們的淞滬、然而今天啊、今天終於臨到了、我們忠勇的將士、還扼守着原有的陣地、絕無絲毫的動搖、可資懷念的今天啊、我們可會輕輕地把它放過、雖然、天是這樣的沉悶、雨還不斷地下着、</p>
<p>午後、我買了二十個銅子的燒酒和十個銅子的花生、獨自在潮濕的屋子裏痛快地喝着、門外滴滴的雨聲、也權充了“爵士”、這是在這裏唯一的慶祝的方法、我在懷念着海上的友人們、將如何度此雙十、</p>
<p>今天前綫還很沉寂、原因是為了連日不斷的下雨、在作戰上發生了很大的困難、</p>
<p>十月十一日</p>
<p>天氣晴朗了、早晨起來看到微弱的陽光、不久便聽到嗡嗡的機聲、攪擾着平靜了多天的空氣、激戰又在蕰藻浜的沿岸展開、唐橋一帶渡河的敵人、企圖向西深進、這是他們一貫的中央突破的戰略、但是終於給我們截住了未能西進寸尺、並且還受到了重大的打擊、同時江灣和閘北方面、也都有劇戰發生、軋軋的機槍和隆隆的砲聲、斷續地打動着耳膜、</p>
<p>今天和一位留居在這裏的六十多歲的老農閒談、他吿訴我、今年的棉花豐收、雖然在結花時受着雨打、每畝還有一擔左右棉花的收穫、只是現在為了敵人的侵略戰、棉花堆在家裏無法出賣、這位老農一邊喝着麥粥、一邊望着上空飛越的敵機、我看出他的眼中是充滿了仇恨的光芒、</p>
<p>將近午夜了、正當我寫着日記的現在、天又起了大風、激越的風聲、從門外傳來、響得有些怕人、雖然、它還掩不了密密的砲聲、我想起了戰壕中的弟兄們、穿着潮濕未乾的衣服、經着狂風的吹襲、不自禁地打了一個寒噤、全國的同胞、記否前綫將士的寒衣、（未完）</p>

<h3>市黨部頒發抗日問答十項</h3>
<p>喚起民衆奮鬥保持國家生命　有錢出錢有心用心有力出力</p>
<p>本市市黨部、為增厚抗敵力量、謀取最後勝利、昨特頒發抗日問答十項、訓令各民衆團體廣為傳播　喚起民衆共同奮鬥、茲錄問答如次、</p>
<p>㊀我們現在爲什么要抗日呢？日本要滅亡我們的國家、我們已忍無可忍讓無可讓、非抗他不能生活了、所以我們非起來抗日不可、</p>
<p>㊁不抗日可不可以呢？不可、不抗日就要當亡國奴了不僅自己當亡國奴、子子孫孫都要當亡國奴的、</p>
<p>㊂什麼呌亡國奴呢？亡國奴就同高麗台灣人樣、任人欺侮、任人刦奪、任人宰殺、祖宗的墳墓不能保　田園莊宅不能保　金銀財寶都不能保、生活眞是連猪狗都不如、</p>
<p>㊃怎樣才能不當亡國奴呢？只有信仰我們中央政府帮助我們的國家軍隊，擁護我們的軍事領袖、大家一致起來抗日、才能不當亡國奴、</p>
<p>㊄怎樣才算是信仰政府、帮助軍隊、擁護領袖呢？</p>
<p>傳聞不實的話不再傳給別人、</p>
<p>㊅要大家一致起來抗日、該當我們要不造謠言不聽謠言、凡怎麼樣？</p>
<p>抗日須有錢的出錢、有心的用心、有力的出力、</p>
<p>㊆怎樣才算有錢的出錢呢？就是把自己所有的一切錢鈔、首飾也好廢銅爛鐵也好糧食也好、貨品也好只要是國家需要的、都毫不吝嗇地甘心樂意地、甚至於自動地拿出來貢獻給國家、</p>
<p>㊇怎樣才算有心的用心呢？爲抗日勝利　為國家生存為子子孫孫不做亡國奴起見、我們要用盡我們心思、想出種種方法來維護社會的秩序、制止漢奸的活動、我們更要不怕危險、不怕犧牲、帮助我們的國軍作戰、消滅敵人的力量、寗肯犧牲自己的性命、來換國家千千萬萬年的生命、</p>
<p>㊈怎樣才算有力的出力呢？國家打仗的時候、更需要貨物、需要糧食、我們作工人的、應該不怕危險、努力工作、多多生產，我們農民、要比平時加倍努力耕種、多多生產糧食、我們商人、應該維持市面、照常營業、且不可抬高物價、這樣、就算有力的出力大家共同抗日了、</p>
<p>㊉我們讀了抗日救國問答應該怎樣作呢？</p>
<p>我們要把每一條都記在心裏、照着牠去實行、我們不實行、便算是對不住國家、不配作中國的國民了、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>英人使許臘森爵士爾士。前日由京來滬途中。被日機槍傷。醫治月餘。始見痊愈。近方赴巴達維亞休養。不料吳大使館武官馬瑞等四人。昨分秉汽車三輛。由京來灑。駛經上海縣驕西鵬橋地方。絲敵機六架。儀補掃射。縣瑞等幸翱妝鈴士協助。暫避壕中。得以無恙。英國使館人員。迭辦敵機掃射。似敵樓故意與英網使館人“開枕笑者。其寶任何汽車。苟鹹瞋饑瞥見者。無一能倖免也。</p>
<p>但有江三應得注意者。一·此次馬瑞武官汽車。覆有巨幅英國國旗於車頂。該機師豈得認爲目光短視。旗小而未之見歟。？二·當馬瑞行時。曾以非正式通知日方。屬爲注意。敵人豈得諉爲未之聞歟。？三·當許閣森爵士受傷後。英當局曾提出嚴重抗議。日亦曾答覆設法以後避免同樣事件。但現在同樣事件又來了。到底敵機不問國别。見車即擊歟。？抑故意對於英國人士過不去歟。？此當詢諸敵軍事當局。其用意究安在也。</p>

<h3>全面抗戰與全民抗戰（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 余孟耀</p>
<p>所以，在目前的中國，最重要的事情，就是要健全民衆酌本身，培養全國人民的實力來支撑國力，並使每個人民都能犧牲一切，抗戰到底！蔣委員長早已經說過：“如果戰端一開，那就是地無分南北，人無分老幼，無論何人，皆有守土抗戰之責任，皆應抱犧牲一切之决心。所以政府必特別謹愼，以臨此大事：全國人民亦必須嚴肅沉着，准備自衛。”現在戰端已開，全面抗戰業已整個發動，我英勇的將士，也已充分的在發揚他們偉大的威力了！但是，這力量還是不夠的，要知道這次抗戰是我們整個的中華民族求生存的抗戰，是我們四萬萬五千萬的黃帝子孫奮發圖強的抗戰，自然應該以整個的民族力量來抵禦敵人的侵略！澈底的發揮民族力量，表現我民族固有精神！</p>
<p>近五十年以來，我們直受夠了日帝國主義的侵略壓迫，我們的土地被敵人强佔了不知幾千萬里，我們的同胞給敵人慘殺了不知有多少！沉痛巨創，眞是仇深似海！我們容忍了這麼長久的年頭眞也是夠受了，現在已經是我們跟敵人淸算的時期到了！我們該痛痛快快地幹一下，全國同胞，大家同心一德的，奮起全民族的力量，爲我們民族，爲我們國家，恊同一致，整齊步伐，向敵人進攻，來和敵人作殊死戰！</p>
<p>我們旣已認識了抗戰的意義，就更應知道在抗戰時期人民的任務，像現在民衆團體的紛紛組織後援會，救亡恊會，戰時服務團，戰地救護隊：等組織，這就是民衆力量很好的表現之一，所以，我們要加强政府的力量，就應該全國人民總動員，組織軍民共同抗敵的聯合陣錢，在我們民族最高領袖蔣委員長指導之下，發揮找民衆的偉大力量，以盡“國家興亡匹夫有責”的天職！</p>
<p>我們可以相信，人民的力量是最偉大的，在美國獨立戰爭時，美國組織的人民武裝隊伍，予英國軍隊很大的打擊，又如月前西班牙人民武裝保衛瑪德里，如狼如虎的叛軍竟奈何他不得，可見民衆武力的一斑。又如辛亥革命也是靠着民衆的力量而能得到成功，這一次是我們整個民族生死存亡之的鬥爭，其意義與使命，較辛亥革命更重要萬分，自須以全力赴之，以得到最後勝利！所以我人民應該立卽總動員，共赴國難，成為全面抗戰時的一員民族戰士。</p>
<p>現在已經是全民抗戰的時候了，我人民自當一致奮起，全民抗戰的任務可分為幾大類，如組織自衛武力，運輸儲備糧食，戰防反動，慰勞救護，厲行經濟絕交等都為目前當務之急，我人民若共同努力苦幹下去，自然，最後的勝利一定是我們的！</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle on the South Bank of the Wenzaobang Creek: Main Force Annihilates Enemy's Breakout Attempt</h3>
<p>Enemy Bloodily Fought for a Day and Night, Penetrating Three Kilometers. Our Reinforcements Encircled and Counter-Attacked, Restoring the Original Defense Line. The Enemy Collapsed and Retreated, No Longer Capable of Re-offending Along the Creek.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Our correspondent accompanying the army in Jiangwan reported on the evening of the 12th at 9 PM that the enemy surrounded on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek launched eastward and westward assaults in the past two days, hoping to break through the encirclement. After being repelled by our army, they changed their plan before dawn today and launched a southward assault with a deep formation. Their offensive method remained unchanged, first with heavy artillery bombardment, followed by infantry charges, fiercely attacking our positions. Around 4 AM, the bloody battle began. The enemy relied on their powerful firepower to continuously advance and pressure, while our army persevered in fighting back. The battle lasted until dawn, when enemy aircraft joined the battle, making the situation even more fierce. Finally, they broke through and penetrated three kilometers southward. At 9 AM, our left and right wings launched fierce attacks from both sides, and the front-line troops also launched reinforced counter-attacks. They braved artillery fire and bullets, repeatedly charging. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented since August 13th. It was truly the main battle on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek. The spirit of our army, unyielding and unretreating, finally won a complete victory. After a bloody battle until 5 PM, the enemy was finally repelled. The enemy troops collapsed and fled in disarray, leaving corpses scattered across the field. They are now retreating and gathering around the Black Dahuan House, Bafang House, and Yang House area along the creek. Although they are still putting up a final stubborn resistance, their strength has been almost completely wiped out by us, and they no longer have the ability to re-offend. The area is entirely under the control of our army. The resolution of the remaining enemy forces is just around the corner. Furthermore, in the Gujiazhai area, the enemy continuously bombarded our positions from the north bank. In the Jiangjiazhai area, there were as many as five or six charges and breakout attempts in one day, but they were closely monitored by us and never succeeded. The enemy's main force attempting to cross the river and advance on Dachang and Nanxiang was completely defeated, and the plan was a complete failure. The great battle centered on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek for the past week can also be said to have come to an end.</p>
<p>Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the army in Jiangwan reported on the evening of the 12th at 11 PM that the enemy troops secretly crossed the river to the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek on the 6th and gathered around the Black Dahuan House, Bafang House, and Yang House area. After days of encirclement and attacks by our army, the remaining forces were only a little over 2,000 people. However, from the evening of the 10th, the enemy troops continued to secretly cross the river in continuous rain, and their strength suddenly increased to a division. The front line advanced to the Bashiqiao House, one kilometer in front of the Black Dahuan House. At dawn yesterday morning, they launched a full-scale offensive with Dachang as their target. The attack was extremely fierce. One point of our army's position was broken through, and the enemy troops advanced three kilometers. At 9 AM, our army reinforced with strong forces and launched a counter-attack from the front, while the two wings bravely launched a flanking attack. A major battle broke out between the two armies, and by 5 PM, the enemy's main force was completely defeated and annihilated. This created an unprecedented victory since the start of the Shanghai battle. Now, the remaining enemy forces are retreating to the edge of the creek and are in complete disarray. Our army is currently taking advantage of the victory to annihilate them.</p>
<p>The south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek was in a fierce and bloody battle all day yesterday. The enemy, who had been surrounded yesterday morning, broke out of the encirclement and launched a full-scale offensive against our army's positions on the Liuhang-Dachang highway, attempting to reach Dachang. At the same time, in order to avoid the fierce strength of our army on the front of the highway, the enemy did not attack on the front of the highway but charged along the small roads on the west side of the highway. Under the enemy's dense artillery fire and the fierce charge of tanks, the enemy broke through several points. However, the situation was not serious, so our army immediately issued an order for a full-scale counter-attack, launching a fierce attack on their left wing to force the retreat of their right wing. Charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, our army rose one after another, bravely attacking and killing countless enemies. The enemy's casualties were extremely heavy, and their right wing, which attempted to advance on Dachang, was forced to retreat due to its inability to support itself. Our left wing took advantage of the victory to advance and still repelled the enemy to the banks of the Wenzaobang Creek. The remaining enemy relied on the cover of artillery fire across the river and defended the Black Dahuan House area, eking out a precarious existence. Last night, in a fierce bloody battle, our army was working hard to eliminate the remaining enemy forces. At the same time, our right wing launched a counter-attack against the enemy forces along the coast, and there was also considerable progress yesterday.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle at Black Dahuan House</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Since the enemy troops crossed the Wenzaobang Creek on the 6th, the focus of the battle has been on its south bank. The enemy troops secretly crossed at narrower parts of the river such as Tangqiao and Shibian'an, and gathered in areas such as Black Dahuan House and Qiangmentou House, with their backs to the water, forming a battle line extending for about two kilometers west of the highway. This area is about four kilometers from Dachang. Our army initially launched a fierce attack on the enemy along the Shanghai-Taicang highway in order to prevent the enemy from making contact with the part that crossed the river in the Dongyangzhai area, and retreated slightly on the front to allow the enemy to advance and encircle them. The enemy, in order to avoid the heavy and take the light, rashly advanced southwest a few days ago and once advanced to Bashiqiao House. The night before, our fresh troops arrived and launched a fierce counter-attack. At the sound of the order, every soldier in our army bravely charged straight into the enemy's position. Although the enemy relied on its dense artillery fire to bombard us, it could not stop our army, which was determined to die and charged forward one after another, advancing without retreating, and finally defeated the enemy. More than sixty corpses were left behind, and they retreated north. Our right wing also took advantage of the situation to attack in order to support the operation. The enemy was under severe pressure and gathered in areas such as Black Dahuan House, Zhaojiajiao, and Qiangmentou House. According to a report from the front at about 5 PM yesterday, fierce fighting was still taking place in places such as Black Dahuan House. Rumors that the enemy had advanced to Dachang are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Remaining Enemy Forces Retreating Towards Tangqiao</p>
<p>Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the army reported at 9:45 AM on the 12th that the enemy who had previously crossed from Jiangjiazhai to the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek was bravely encircled and attacked by our army, and surrounded on three sides. Last night, they still tried to break out of the encirclement, and bombarded our positions with fierce artillery fire all night, attempting to destroy our fortifications. Then they launched a full-scale attack, but after being dealt a heavy blow by our army head-on, the enemy could not hold on and collapsed towards Tangqiao. At dawn this morning, the enemy was restless again, and our army immediately carried out dense machine gun fire and threw hand grenades fiercely. The enemy has not been able to cross the line. At the time of the report, fierce fighting was still taking place. Furthermore, the remaining enemy forces in the Gujiazhai area were also attacked by our army once again at dawn this morning, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The enemy is hiding in the village and dare not attack. Our army has decided to severely punish them and completely eliminate them in the near future.</p>
<p>Artillery Battle Between Both Sides at Shixianggong Temple</p>
<p>Central News Agency Guangfu correspondent reported at 11 PM on the 12th that there has been no fierce fighting on the entire line from north of Guangfu to Caowang Temple for days due to the accumulation of water from the rain, which has made it difficult for the army to move. However, the enemy frequently used heavy artillery to fiercely bombard our army's positions from north of Shixianggong Temple to Caowang Temple, but our fortifications did not suffer major damage. We also returned fire. The enemy at Xiaojiazhai, south of the North Shu Canal, attacked and once broke through our alert line, but was quickly recovered by our army's counter-attack. There are currently no changes on the entire line.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting North and South of Guangfu Town</h3>
<p>Enemy Attacking Mengjiazhai and Zhoujiazhai Repelled</p>
<p>Our army's position at Mengjiazhai, about two kilometers southeast of Guangfu Town, was attacked by a large force of enemy troops yesterday. The enemy troops attacked fiercely under dense artillery fire. Our army fought bravely to meet the enemy and engaged with them, and finally repelled the enemy. In the afternoon, the enemy reinforcements came again, and the fighting was very fierce. It did not stop all night last night. According to news from the front this morning, the enemy has collapsed and retreated.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the enemy troops attacked our army's position at Zhoujiazhai, north of Guangfu Town, again yesterday. Our army suffered considerable casualties under the enemy's fierce artillery fire, but still held the original position. After receiving reinforcements from fresh troops, they finally repelled the enemy. The enemy also suffered heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Attempt to Land at Liuhe Suffers a Miserable Defeat</h3>
<p>Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses and Collapses in Disarray. Shelling of the Coast Continues Yesterday.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the long-silent mouth of the Liuhe River was once again packed with enemy warships, including twenty gunboats and seventeen transport ships, which were docked there from the mouth of the Liuhe River to the Qiyakou, end to end, stretching for twelve miles. Our garrison reported this and was on high alert. At around 6 PM the night before, enemy ships began to bombard the coast with dense artillery fire, followed by enemy troops in multiple speedboats, sailing towards the shore under the cover of artillery fire, attempting to land at the ports of Maqiao, Yanglin, Qiya, and Luhan. Our army held its breath and waited, and when they sailed close, machine guns and hand grenades were fired all at once. The enemy was extremely panicked, and many were hit and fell into the water. Some had already waded close to the shore, their calves trapped in the sand, unable to avoid and were shot dead. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy knew that it could not be violated and collapsed in disarray. According to reports yesterday, enemy ships continued to bombard the shore with artillery fire, and their landing attempt did not seem to have been abandoned. However, our coastal defense is extremely solid, and if the enemy attacks again, it will be difficult for them to succeed.</p>
<h3>Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses in Zhabei and Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Our Army Counter-Attacks and Defeats the Enemy on Three Routes, Destroying Two Enemy Vehicles and Killing Hundreds</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: A correspondent accompanying the army in Zhabei reported at 12:30 PM on the 12th that the street fighting in Guangdong Street, Dongbaoxing Road, and other places has been intermittent and continues until 3 AM this morning. The enemy's casualties reached more than 130 before they completely retreated. Our army then carried out a dawn attack at around 4 AM, before dawn. One route attacked from Tanjiazhai, Chizhi University, and Guangdong Middle School, and attacked Aiguo Girls' School from the Shuidian Road. Another route copied out from Guangli Road and attacked the enemy's flank in the 63 Garden. At the same time, the Baziqiao area also attacked out from Liuying Road and pounced on the Japanese cemetery. Many enemy tanks fired back and forth on Jiangwan Road, covering their infantry's stubborn resistance. However, our army rose and fell, unpredictable, and the enemy army was unable to cope. By 9 AM, the enemy's casualties had reached more than 150. Then, enemy aircraft were dispatched, and our army retreated to defend the strongholds, and the battle stopped. Furthermore, in the Jiangwan area, the invading enemy troops were completely repelled by us at 5:30 AM. In this battle, our flat-trajectory guns exerted their firepower, destroying two enemy vehicles and killing sixty to seventy enemy troops.</p>
<p>Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the army reported at 9:45 AM on the 12th that from last night to this morning, the enemy attacked our army's positions at Fudan University, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, Jiangwan Racecourse, and Nantianlu Temple several times. After our brave counter-attack, the enemy was dealt a heavy blow and was finally repelled. As for the Miaohang area, there has been no contact on the front line of our army from last night to this morning, and the front line has been quite silent. Central News Agency reports: Our correspondent accompanying the army in Jiangwan reported at 9 PM on the 12th that Bazhiqiao House, north of Jiangwan Racecourse, is an important stronghold on our line. This morning, the enemy suddenly launched a fierce attack and once occupied it, but it was recovered by our counter-attack. The enemy actually continued to reinforce and attacked again. In one day, we lost and regained it four times. Both sides suffered heavy losses. By night, the enemy retreated due to exhaustion and dared not attack again.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Zhabei correspondent reported at 0:30 AM on the 13th that yesterday afternoon, more than twenty enemy aircraft circled and bombed in the sky over Zhabei, going back and forth for four hours, dropping no less than one or two hundred bombs. Their targets were still the Gonghe Road and Baoshan Road areas. After the enemy aircraft left near evening, our army stepped up its guard to prevent the enemy from attacking. At 10 PM, enemy tanks were seen moving back and forth at the intersection of Guangdong Street and Qiujiang Road. In order to preemptively strike, our army did not wait for them to attack and threw hand grenades fiercely from the outposts, and our machine gun squad also rushed to the scene from behind and fired at the enemy. The fighting was intermittent and lasted for about half an hour. About a company of enemy troops came forward crawling under the cover of their tanks. Our army jumped out and charged, and after about an hour of street fighting, the enemy left more than twenty corpses behind and eventually retreated without success. Central News Agency Jiangwan correspondent reported at 0:30 AM on the 13th that according to reconnaissance reports, around 4 PM yesterday afternoon, the enemy troops were very busy maneuvering in the Lingnan Middle School area near Gaojingmiao, and there were more than twenty tanks active in that area. Our army was closely watching them, because the enemy's attacks on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Creek had failed, and they might be harassing that area. Then, at around 6 PM, the enemy at Sijing Stadium and Zhangxizhai suddenly attacked our Hejiaxiang position. Our army calmly fought back on the one hand, and launched an attack from Yejia Garden on the other, attacking the enemy's left wing. After several charges by our army, the enemy retreated slightly under the cover of the machine gun squad due to pressure at about 9 PM. Our army advanced with the enemy, and at 10:30 PM, they were confronting each other in the Xujingqiao Zhangxizhai area. At the time of the report, the fierce fighting had not yet ended.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bombing Zhabei Extensively</h3>
<p>Many Bombs Dropped in Pudong and Western Shanghai. Absurd Leaflets Scattered Again in Various Parts of Nanshi.</p>
<p>From 1 PM yesterday afternoon, more than ten enemy heavy bombers, divided into teams of three aircraft each, bombed Zhabei extensively. Each time they dropped three bombs. They did not leave until around 5 PM. The total number of bombs dropped reached about one hundred, which was the first time it has been seen since the start of the Shanghai battle. As for the places where the bombs fell, the most were along the Hengbang River and in the Qiujiang Road and Baoshan Road areas. However, because they were afraid of our anti-aircraft artillery fire, they did not dare to fly low and only dropped bombs randomly in the air. Therefore, although many bombs were dropped, our military did not suffer any losses except for damage to civilian houses.</p>
<p>From 2 PM to 5 PM yesterday, artillery fire and enemy aircraft bombing did not stop in Zhabei. The railway line east of the Commercial Press, the intersection of Qiujiang Road and the railway track, the Jiangwan Station, and Dachang were bombed extensively. Furthermore, enemy aircraft bombed near the Chuansha Light Railway and the Central Mint in the afternoon. Eight people were injured at the time.</p>
<p>At around 4 PM yesterday afternoon, four enemy aircraft circled the area north of the Jisi Fei'er Road and the Tanzi Bay in Zhabei in western Shanghai and dropped more than ten bombs. Houses in the Tanzi Bay area immediately caught fire. Two more large bombs fell on the open space behind the Central Mint, killing one person and injuring two others. After dropping the bombs, the aircraft flew eastward.</p>
<p>The enemy's hatred for our army in Pudong is deeply rooted. From morning to night yesterday, they dispatched aircraft to continuously drop bombs and bomb all day long. However, because there were no targets, most of them fell in the fields, and only a few civilian houses were destroyed. This kind of atrocity is purely intended to retaliate against the heavy damage inflicted on them by our artillery, but our military has not actually suffered any damage. Furthermore, at 3 PM yesterday afternoon, three enemy aircraft flew low reconnaissance over the Yangjiadu, Zhangjiabang, and Dongchang Wharf areas of Pudong, dropped three or four bombs, and strafed with machine guns.</p>
<p>At around 3 PM yesterday afternoon, three enemy aircraft came to Nanshi and scattered absurd leaflets. They circled the city for two weeks before flying to Gaochangmiao and Longhua to spy on them, and then flew north towards Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai. The enemy is trying to incite our people with this because of their military disadvantages. This kind of behavior is extremely shameless.</p>
<p>At around 5 PM yesterday afternoon, enemy aircraft bombed Zhabei extensively. A bomb hit the Dalong Iron Factory in the northern Gorden Road, injuring four workers in the factory at the time. Part of the factory building was bombed and damaged. The injured were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bombing Refugees Going to Jiaxing</h3>
<p>More Than Fifty Refugees Killed or Injured</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's War Zone Refugee Relief Committee sent more than 1,000 refugees to Jiaxing on the Da'an Wheel the day before, escorted by Yu Zuojie, dispatched by the association's dispatching section. Yesterday afternoon, the association received a telegram from Yu Jun from Jiaxing reporting that (details omitted) at the moment, the Da'an Wheel arrived in Jiaxing outside the foreign customs. Enemy aircraft bombed and injured about fifty refugees, killing one person and injuring three boatmen. The wheel will return to Shanghai tomorrow evening. The association's chairman and vice-chairman, Qu Wenliu and Huang Hanzhi, were extremely concerned about the refugees' injuries after hearing the news. They immediately replied by telegram, stating that if the injured refugees cannot be admitted to a hospital in Jiaxing, please provide emergency treatment and send them back to Shanghai for treatment on the original ship.</p>
<p>News from the transportation industry is that enemy aircraft came out to harass again yesterday morning. At around 9 AM, three bombers flew to Jiaxing and dropped bombs. The third refugee shelter there was hit and destroyed, killing many refugees. Details are pending investigation. Qishuyan near Wuxi and Kuatang outside Suzhou were also harassed by enemy aircraft, and three to several bombs were dropped in each place. Losses are pending investigation. In this city, six enemy aircraft have been constantly bombing Pudong since early morning, and pointing out the targets for enemy warship shelling. Near noon, five enemy aircraft circled endlessly north of the concession. Our army bombarded them with anti-aircraft artillery, and the sound of huge bombs exploding and anti-aircraft artillery was thunderous and continuous, shocking the entire city.</p>
<h3>Artillery Battle Raged All Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>Enemy Artillery Aimless, Only Damaging Civilian Houses. Izumo Warship Moved, Fearing Our Artillery Fire.</p>
<p>Enemy Artillery Randomly Bombing, Aimless</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River shelled Pudong aimlessly all day yesterday. Among them, the enemy gunboat anchored at buoy number nine fired the most artillery. Its target was the China Merchants Bureau Huazhan area in Pudong, causing the pier and nearby civilian houses to catch fire. The fire burned for a long time. Three to five enemy aircraft also occasionally flew in formation over the area to spy and drop bombs.</p>
<p>Izumo Moved to Avoid Our Artillery Fire</p>
<p>Our Pudong artillery positions bombarded enemy positions in Yangshupu on National Day, inflicting heavy setbacks on the enemy and destroying two enemy warships, establishing special merits. Since yesterday morning until late at night, the enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River retaliated from time to time with sparse artillery fire. Our army pretended not to care, and the enemy only wasted unnecessary ammunition. From 9 PM the night before, the two sides exchanged fire until 4 AM yesterday morning, becoming more intense. There was a gun sound almost every second, and residents throughout the city were awakened from their dreams. It gradually stopped at 6 AM, but the firing continued from time to time until after 9 AM, when the sound of artillery fire was no longer heard. Afterwards, according to the Huadong News Agency reporter's inquiries with military agencies, the artillery battle the night before was rare since the war of resistance began. In total, the enemy fired about six to seven hundred shells, and our side also fired more than three hundred shells. Because our firing targets were accurate, the enemy's position suffered heavy damage. When the artillery battle was fierce at around 4 AM, the enemy flagship "Izumo" anchored in the Huangpu River moved three hundred meters downstream to avoid our artillery fire and did not return to its original mooring until 6:30 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Huishan Wharf Hit by Our Artillery Shell</p>
<p>During the fierce artillery battle yesterday morning, more than 1,000 enemy reinforcements landed at Huishan Wharf, but unexpectedly, they were hit by our artillery shells. Dozens of enemy troops were killed by the explosion on the spot. In addition, a shell fell on the ammunition concentration point east of the wharf and also exploded. All the military equipment was destroyed. Therefore, as a result of the artillery battle yesterday morning, the enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. Afterwards, the enemy became angry and fired aimlessly, firing two shots at our side every few seconds in an attempt to vent their anger, but because their target was completely aimless, it had no impact on us.</p>
<p>Enemy Warship and War Horses Damaged</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that on the morning of the 11th, four enemy transport ships arrived in the Yangshupu and Huishan Wharf area, bringing in a large number of military supplies. They were unloaded in the late at night. When our Pudong artillery team detected this, they took advantage of the unloading to bombard them with heavy artillery, hitting two enemy warships and destroying many of their military supplies. More than a thousand enemy war horses at the Yangshupu and Qiujiang Wharf were also killed, hundreds of them.</p>
<p>Kezhi Iron Factory Suffered Unjustly</p>
<p>The Kezhi Iron Factory near the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong was bombarded by an enemy warship with flat-trajectory guns at 12 noon yesterday. The first two shells sank the factory's floating wharf into the river. Afterwards, five or six more shells, all sulfur bombs, were fired continuously at the factory building, exploding and catching fire. At one time, thick smoke and flames shot high into the sky, which was extremely fierce. Because it was located on the front line of the Pudong, it was impossible to rescue. It burned until dusk before being extinguished. The factory building was completely destroyed, and the losses were very heavy.</p>
<h3>Enemy Continues to Ship in Large Quantities of Munitions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after the enemy officers launched four general attacks on our side, they have not seen any progress so far, and their military strength has been frustrated. The losses of military supplies are especially large. Yesterday, the enemy destroyer No. 1 and the small transport ship No. 11 Liangyou Maru docked at the north warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau, carrying a large amount of munitions and a large amount of kerosene. In addition, the enemy transport ship Tearumi Maru, which was anchored in the China Merchants Bureau's central warehouse and the Huangpu Wharf, and the No. 82 transport ship Zhuji Maru, which was converted from a merchant ship, were also loaded with munitions and coal. Dagong News Agency reports that at dawn yesterday morning, an enemy transport ship sailed to Qiujiang Wharf and immediately unloaded more than 2,000 boxes of bombs, which were transferred to the enemy air force base at the International Golf Course for use. In addition, 400 boxes of aircraft parts were also unloaded and brought ashore. They were not completely unloaded and sailed away until 10:30 AM. According to an unofficial statistic from a certain agency, since the start of the Shanghai battle, the total number of large and small bombs consumed by the enemy air force has reached more than 40,000, with a minimum value of 800 yuan per bomb, which means that the consumption has reached more than 32 million yuan. However, this kind of consumption by the enemy has not gained any military benefit except for the suffering of our innocent people and the destruction of civilian houses. Therefore, this move by the enemy has no meaning at all.</p>
<h3>Aviation Captain of the British Embassy and Others Attacked by Japanese Aircraft Yesterday</h3>
<p>Informal Notification Procedures Thorough. Pilot Regards the British Flag as if it is Not There. Murray and Others Suffered a Fright in Maqiao</p>
<p>Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador, was shot and injured by Japanese aircraft on the way from Nanjing to Shanghai last month. The news spread and shocked the world. The British government made a serious protest, and Japan replied that it would try to avoid the same incident from happening again. However, the Japanese aircraft, which specialize in threatening non-combatants, still did not restrain themselves and attacked Murray, the Aviation Captain of the British Embassy, again yesterday. It is reported that Murray and four others were in three cars coming from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday. At about 5 PM, when they drove through Maqiao in Shanghai County, they were discovered by six Japanese aircraft circling there to spy. The car had a large British flag on the roof, as requested by the Japanese side, but the pilot regarded it as if it was not there and still flew low to strafe with machine guns. Fortunately, Murray and others were assisted by our police officers and temporarily took shelter in an air-raid shelter on the side of the road, which prevented them from being killed. After the Japanese aircraft left, Murray and others got into the car. After driving less than three miles, they were shot at again in front of the Shanghai County government. County Chief Ye heard the news and rushed out to entertain them and express his condolences. They safely returned to Shanghai at about 6 PM. It is heard that Murray had informally notified the Japanese side of this trip in advance, and the procedures were very thorough, but they still suffered a fright, which shows that the actions of the Japanese aircraft are truly unreasonable.</p>
<h3>Westerner's Letter to the North-China Daily News Criticizing Enemy's Deceptive Words</h3>
<p>Cold-Hearted Upon Hearing the October 10th Promise　Blaming the Unfavorable Consecutive Battles on Heaven　American Newspaper Comments That the Enemy's Army Is Not Worth Mentioning</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News yesterday published a letter from a Westerner named Boted, dated October 10th, stating: I believe everyone remembers that the Japanese military spokesman predicted that the Japanese army could force the Chinese army to withdraw from the Shanghai area before October 10th. The Chinese military spokesman then asked, "Which October 10th are you referring to?" Whether the date predicted by the Japanese military spokesman is accurate is another matter, but their decisive tone made people feel as if the war was a friendly soccer match, where both sides could negotiate to move the date earlier or predetermine it. The spokesman seemed very confident about the timing of the Chinese army's withdrawal, so it is reasonable for us to ask today whether the predetermined date is reliable. Today is October 10th in the Gregorian calendar, and today's battles are no further from Shanghai than when they began. In two months of bitter fighting, Japan has shown off its new-era military preparations, sparing no effort, but has ultimately failed to advance the Japanese army to any location. However, let us be patient. Perhaps the Japanese military spokesman believes that the Chinese army will withdraw at exactly 12:00 midnight today? I am writing this letter in the morning, so I cannot be certain yet. Perhaps the Japanese have their own calendar, like the Chinese have a lunar calendar? Regardless of how the Japanese military spokesman's promise is interpreted, I feel that the Chinese army shows no sign of retreating, not only today, but also probably not on the humble predicted date of October 15, 1937. What is pitiful is that the Japanese army is now in a position where it cannot predict anything, and has no control over the war situation. If the Japanese could predict everything (when I say "predict," I mean reasonable speculation, not wishful thinking), then the war would never have dragged on until today. These meaningless predictions constantly enter our ears, and I ask that they not be repeated, as they are tiresome to hear. The Japanese may consider them important, but they only make people feel cold-hearted. It should be known that the prestige of the Japanese Empire's army and navy cannot be maintained by bragging.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News also said that American newspapers had criticized the Japanese army as unworthy of mention. One day, the Japanese military spokesman responded to these criticisms, stating that the Japanese army's offensive in the Shanghai area had already begun. Although there were no confirmed reports about the battle situation in the Liuhang and Luodian areas in the evening, the spokesman said that once the weather cleared, the Japanese army's advance would be only a matter of time. The spokesman admitted that the unfavorable weather in recent days had prevented the Japanese army from operating, and that the battles in the entire area had to be conducted separately, making it difficult to coordinate activities. In addition, the ground was full of water, and ditches crisscrossed the area, while the Chinese army had the concession area as its backing, as if relying on a wall, preventing the Japanese army from acting freely. The translator notes that the Japanese army uses the concession area as a base of operations, but claims that the Chinese army relies on the concession area. The Japanese army makes these many self-justifying statements because its operations have not been smooth. They say that the weather is unfavorable, but in reality, the weather has greatly helped the Japanese army. Otherwise, how could they have justified failing to expel the Chinese army from the Shanghai area before October 10th?</p>
<h3>Armed Enemy Troops Spying and Drawing Maps</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that in recent days, armed and plainclothes Japanese people have often been seen drawing maps on the roof of the Nissin Shipping Company Building at the corner of the Bund and Guangdong Road, and spying on the Chinese army's positions in Pudong. On Saturday and Sunday, a large group of armed Japanese people, mostly Japanese naval officers, went to the roof of the building to inspect, with some drawing maps and others observing with binoculars. This morning (October 12th), a plainclothes Japanese person stood on the roof for a long time.</p>
<h3>Enemy Falsely Reports Number of Casualties to Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that on Monday, the Japanese army spokesman, when meeting with foreign reporters, claimed that in the Shanghai battles, a total of 57,767 Chinese soldiers had been killed on various fronts, while approximately 2,800 Japanese soldiers had died. The number of Japanese soldiers killed was not yet detailed. The translator notes that our army's loyal and brave soldiers who died in battle and the number of casualties have never been announced by the authorities, yet the Japanese military spokesman knows them down to the last digit. One wonders what magical powers they possess. They add the words "approximately" to the number of Japanese soldiers killed, which, if they had said that the Chinese army had approximately that many casualties, would have been more believable, but now it only shows their absurdity. The Japanese propaganda is truly foolish.</p>
<h3>Brave Warrior Zhu Cuts the Bridge to Repel the Enemy</h3>
<p>Entering the Water From South and North Achieves Success　Wisdom and Courage Combined, Praised by the Entire Army</p>
<p>The enemy on the south bank of the Wenzaobang River, after days of valiant encirclement and attack by our army, has now been mostly annihilated, and the remaining enemy troops can be completely eliminated soon. According to military news yesterday, on the night of the 8th, when the enemy army crossed the river, there was a noteworthy and precious event that has not yet been widely circulated: that night, the enemy army occupied the north bank of the Wenzaobang River, and the artillery fire was exceptionally fierce. Several enemy planes provided cover for the advance, and smoke screens were released along the riverbank. In less than an hour, thousands of enemy troops secretly crossed the river. Their actions were extremely stealthy and rapid. When this was discovered by our army, they immediately charged forward and engaged in a fierce bloody battle. First-class soldier Zhu Kunshan, a brave warrior, was ordered to rush to the riverbank, plunged into the water, swam to the north bank, and threw multiple hand grenades, then returned to the south bank and threw several more grenades. The enemy's temporary pontoon bridge was completely destroyed, cutting off their route. Seeing that the mission was accomplished, Zhu safely landed and returned to his unit. In this battle, the fact that the enemy could not cross the river in large numbers was largely due to the great contribution of brave warrior Zhu. He has been commended by order of the division commander and has been rewarded with fifty gold pieces. Such a brave warrior is worthy of praise.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>China Should Fully Utilize Its Own Strengths</h3>
<p>— Tao Fen</p>
<p>China is a weak country, which, in a sense, is quite correct, especially in terms of industrial backwardness and insufficient military preparedness, which are quite apparent. However, from the perspective of the struggle for national liberation, China also has its strengths. In fact, our country has not yet fully utilized our own strengths, which is a very regrettable and thought-provoking matter.</p>
<p>What are these strengths? I believe it is the great power of the people with a profound national consciousness. However, this great power is still in a latent state, like a boundless treasure of gold mines, deeply buried underground, not yet developed and not yet fully utilized by us. In our country, perhaps some people are still confused about this great power, or deliberately turn a blind eye to it, but our national enemies seem to be worried about it, so they are playing the role of provoking discord between our government and the people. For example, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe recently reiterated that Japan's military action against China is only to punish the Chinese Nanjing government and military leaders, and that the innocent and kind Chinese people are not Japan's enemies. Who doesn't know that the Chinese government's resistance to Japan reflects the urgent demands of the people of the whole country? Because the people of the whole country launched the war of resistance against Japan, they are becoming more and more enthusiastic in their support for the government; the whole country is united to deal with our common enemy—Japanese imperialism. However, Japanese imperialists must use all kinds of tricks to separate our people from the government, because they see the terrible nature of China's great popular power, which, once fully utilized by China, is difficult for them to cope with. It is not surprising that our enemies try their best to destroy this advantage, but it is a very regrettable thing if we ourselves allow this "treasure" to remain buried underground.</p>
<p>This advantage of ours is something that invading countries want but cannot get. After Japanese imperialism began its invasion of China, their political parties publicly demanded that the Japanese government explain the reasons for using troops in China. According to a friend who recently returned from Japan, many people in Japan asked why they had to come to China to fight! They are not without people, but under the military aggression launched by a few warlords and plutocrats, even with the use of anesthetic means and oppressive methods, the power of the people cannot be awakened. The situation is very different in invaded China. Every day, I, as the editor of "Resistance Three Daily," read countless letters from readers, and I am always deeply moved by their sincere patriotism and their willingness to make any sacrifices for the country's war of resistance without regret. At the same time, I also feel that the government's efforts to mobilize the people are not enough, so that many people who are determined to work hard for the country are trapped in a state of helplessness and have no way to serve. Therefore, I increasingly feel that China has not yet fully utilized its own strengths.</p>
<p>I remember that Liang Rengong wrote a biography of Li Hongzhang, saying that what Li Hongzhang could be proud of was that in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Japan was not fighting China, but Li Hongzhang. For Li Hongzhang, fighting a country with one person may have been something to be proud of, but in China at that time, the failure of one person brought endless disasters to the country, which cannot be said to have been a tragic event for the Chinese nation. The aftermath of this tragedy for China continues to this day and has not disappeared. At that time, Japan forced Li Hongzhang to personally go to Japan to sign a peace treaty, and some people said that this was intended to insult Li Hongzhang, but the cession of land and indemnities were a great loss to the Chinese nation. This time, the entire Chinese nation is fighting against Japanese imperialism, and the situation is certainly different from the era of Li Hongzhang, but at that time, the only one that Japan was fighting against seemed to be Li Hongzhang alone, and now it seems that Japan is only fighting against China's two million troops! I want to emphasize this point in particular, because according to the actual performance, what is actually fighting Japan is only the army, there is only military mobilization, and although other parts have gradually begun to be launched there, in such an emergency period, such slowness, such a lack of overall planning, and such dispersion are absolutely not enough. We need to catch up quickly and make up for it.</p>
<p>We have 450 million great people, which is a fact, but if we do not make full use of them, it is only an empty number and will still not have any practical effect. We have this advantage—having great popular power—which our enemies do not have, which is also a fact, but if we do not make full use of it, it is as if we do not have it, which is tantamount to eliminating our own advantages and eliminating a concern for the enemy. This is truly a heinous crime against national interests! If this is not urgently and effectively remedied, Japan only had to deal with Li Hongzhang alone in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, and now it only has to deal with our two million troops. This crisis is really worthy of our serious attention and profound understanding.</p>
<p>If China really wants to fight a protracted war, if it really wants to win the final victory, it must make full use of its own strengths—the great popular power that is still latent and has not been actively developed.</p>
<h3>The Times of London Condemns Japan's Policy of Poisoning</h3>
<p>Manchukuo and North China Become Sources of Drug Trafficking　Japan's Brutality and Cruelty Lead to a Decline in Prestige</p>
<p>[London] Today, The Times of London published an editorial commenting on the parts of the League of Nations Opium Committee report concerning Japan. The newspaper said, "It is difficult to understand why a country that claims to promote improvement in the Far East by its own example allows the spread of the opium scourge within its sphere of influence." The report of the League of Nations Opium Committee has now been sent to the United Kingdom and the United States. The Times of London article also pointed out that the Chinese in North China and "Manchukuo" are the worst sufferers. "In Harbin and Fukiatien, there are nearly 100 state-run opium dens and about 1,000 heroin dens. On one street in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, there are more than 50 shops selling heroin, the price of which is only one-tenth of that sold in Egypt. It is estimated that nine-tenths of the world's illegal heroin comes from the 'Manchukuo' and North China provinces under Japanese influence, with Tianjin as the center of distribution. Those engaged in this trade enjoy the protection of Japanese officials. However, in Japan and Korea, the sale and cultivation of drugs are strictly prohibited, so there are very few addicts." However, the market for drugs must have certain limits, and those addicted to drugs generally fall into poverty, while Japan's large-scale drug manufacturing machine is booming and must open up a wider market, which poses a danger to other countries. The newspaper further stated, "Japan's prestige has been undermined by the brutality and cruelty of its soldiers, and now the promotion of drugs will tarnish its reputation. No matter what level a national government reaches, it cannot allow people to suspect that it is supporting and encouraging this kind of disreputable business to an unprecedented extent."

<h3>Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>To Be Held in Brussels on the 25th of This Month　British and American Attendees Have Been Internally Decided</p>
<p>[Tokyo] It was learned here today that the United Kingdom recently asked Belgium to issue invitations based on Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty to hold a meeting in Brussels to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue. The date of the meeting is tentatively set for the 25th of this month. Only the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty were invited. The Belgian government has agreed.

<p>⊙Brussels It has now been generally decided that the rumored Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the Far East will be held in Brussels, approximately within two weeks. The United States has also practically agreed to send representatives to participate. The Belgian side is very welcoming to the selection of the venue, because although Belgium has extensive commercial relations with China, its political intentions are zero, such as the fact that the country has already abandoned the Belgian concession in Tianjin, etc., which can greatly guarantee the neutrality of the meeting place. Furthermore, Belgium is not a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>[London] According to well-informed sources, President Roosevelt may send Ambassador Davis to be the chief representative to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Washington is said to be very welcoming to the meeting in Brussels. As for whether to invite Soviet Russia to participate, there are two views: one is that Soviet Russia is not a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, and the other is that Soviet Russia has close ties to Far Eastern affairs. Whether to invite or not is still to be decided. Regarding the question of whether Italy will attend, these people speculate that, judging from its cold attitude towards the League of Nations, it may not participate in the meeting. (Haitong News on the 11th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the selection of British representatives to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, there has been much discussion in the newspapers today. It is generally believed that Foreign Secretary Eden will be the chief representative, and former Acting Foreign Secretary Halifax or Foreign Under-Secretary Cranborne will serve as the second representative. Former Ambassador to China Cadogan will serve as chairman of the British Far Eastern Affairs Expert Committee. (Haitong News on the 12th)</p>

According to reliable information, opinions within the Privy Council are still very divided on Konoe's proposal. One faction believes that this is a redundant and superfluous organization. However, Konoe said that this is a temporary organization, and its scope is limited to diplomatic, financial, economic, and post-war issues in the Sino-Japanese issue, and its power is limited to advisory advice and has no decision-making power.

<h3>Enemy Planes Attacked Nanjing Three Times Yesterday</h3>
<p>Five Aircraft Shot Down After Fierce Battles; Fierce Air Combat Over Jiangyin; Suzhou Sounded Alarms Fifteen Times in One Day; Refugee Ships in Jiaxing Also Straſed; Humen, Wujin, Guangde, Hangzhou, and Songjiang All Bombed</p>
<p>[Nanjing] On the 12th, enemy planes attacked Nanjing three times. The first time was at 11:00 AM when bombers flew from Shanghai to Nanjing. Our air force, upon receiving the report, dispatched multiple aircraft, encountering the enemy planes over Danyang. Two enemy planes were hit by our air force and seemed to crash near Danyang. The second time was at 2:00 PM when thirty enemy planes, divided into three groups, came via Longtan (nine planes), Tangshan (nine planes), and Shierxu (twelve planes). Our air force immediately deployed separately to engage them over Longtan, Tangshan, and other areas. At 3:40 PM, three enemy heavy bombers, protected by six fighter escorts, launched a sneak attack over Nanjing. Another part of our air force engaged them, and dense anti-aircraft fire from the suburbs and urban areas resulted in one enemy plane being shot down by our air force at the Yang residence, No. 5 Shuiyouying, inside Wuding Gate. Both the plane and its occupants were destroyed. It was reported that one plane was shot down in Longtan. The third time was at 4:00 PM when nine enemy planes flew from Shanghai. Our air force again deployed to engage them over Zhenjiang, and the enemy immediately fled. We did not pursue them, and the alert was lifted at 4:40 PM (Special dispatch on the 12th).</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A fierce air battle occurred in the capital this afternoon. Two sounds of a bell suddenly sounded, and an alarm was issued. Forty minutes later, nine Japanese bombers appeared from the northeast, heading south directly over Nanjing. Amidst intense anti-aircraft fire, the enemy planes dropped several bombs, landing outside the South Gate. The bombs were larger than those used previously. Chinese fighter planes immediately took to the air to engage them. Simultaneously, three Japanese fighter escorts dove down from high altitude to protect their bombers. A fierce battle immediately ensued. The anti-aircraft guns stopped firing, allowing the planes to clash. Pilots on both sides displayed their skills in the air, like eagles fighting. Spectators were astonished and marveled at the sight. The air battles over Nanjing had never been so intense before. Soon, a Chinese fighter plane flew above an enemy plane and fired fiercely with its machine guns. The enemy plane was hit, caught fire, and crashed into the house of a certain family in the eastern part of the city, killing all five occupants. The house was also severely damaged. At the same time, one Chinese pilot, apparently injured, safely landed at the old palace airfield during the battle. It was later learned that he only suffered a slight cheek injury. After the bell sounded three times, the enemy planes disappeared from the sky, leaving only Chinese fighter planes circling triumphantly. According to Chinese authorities, it has been confirmed that five enemy planes were shot down today in the Nanjing-Hankou area: two light bombers in the morning, two fighters in the afternoon, and one heavy bomber. This morning, two enemy light bombers bombed Suzhou Railway Station and then flew to Zhenjiang, where they were surrounded and shot down by Chinese fighter planes. In the afternoon air battle, one enemy bomber was shot down in the eastern part of the city, and one fighter plane was shot down east of the Mausoleum Sports Field. Another one crashed not far outside the South Gate. Curious onlookers flocked to the scene. It was reported that a total of thirty Japanese planes flew over Kunshan this morning, heading towards the capital. Another seven enemy planes appeared in the skies over Guangde. However, according to Chinese sources, only twenty-four enemy planes entered the Nanjing area today (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 12th).</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At 2:00 PM on the 12th, nine enemy heavy bombers and six fighter planes advanced towards Nanjing along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Our air force, upon receiving the report, went to intercept them. However, our squadron leader, Liu Cuigang, remained alone in the Nanjing sky to await the enemy. At 2:30 PM, the enemy planes flew in formation into the Nanjing sky. An enemy fighter plane rushed towards Liu to provoke him. When they reached the southern part of the city, Liu suddenly rose to a high altitude, preparing to maneuver against the enemy. The enemy plane also climbed quickly to compete. They engaged in fierce combat, ascending and descending dozens of times. Just as the enemy plane turned, Squadron Leader Liu fired fiercely from the side. The enemy was caught off guard, immediately hit, and burst into flames. The explosion was deafening, shaking the entire city. The enemy plane crashed into the Yang residence, No. 5 Shui Zuo Ying, in the eastern part of the city. Witnesses unanimously praised Squadron Leader Liu's valiant and extraordinary combat skills. The remaining planes, seeing the unfavorable situation, fled towards the Maqun town area outside Zhongshan Gate. One of our planes continued to bravely pursue them, engaging an enemy fighter plane over Xianhemen. After a brief maneuvering, the enemy plane was hit by our fire. The enemy pilot, seeing the imminent danger, attempted to parachute to safety. Unexpectedly, the parachute was shot and destroyed by our fire, and the enemy pilot fell to the ground and died. The enemy plane also crashed and caught fire. The remaining planes then turned towards Yanziji. Air Force fighter Cao Fangzhen engaged them there. Unfortunately, due to the disparity in numbers, Cao died in action, and his plane also crashed and was damaged. The enemy planes then fled in disarray.

<h3>Coming and Going in Bombing</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>A suitcase, a roll of bedding, ordered by Director Chunru to be moved into the Capital Hotel, so temporarily put himself in Room 214 there. The hotel is run entirely in Western style, and the room is quite clean. There is a bathroom, which is just what I like, so I took a bath to sweep away the dust accumulated on my body for the past two or three days.</p>
<p>In the white porcelain basin, I thought of the ancients saying 'Fasting and bathing can worship God'. I felt that we Chinese seemed to be the most cleanliness-loving and bath-conscious nation in ancient times, and even endowed the matter of bathing with religious sentiment. Zeng Dian's "bathing in the Yi River, enjoying the breeze in the Wu Yu", deeply praised by Confucius, was probably out of the same sentiment. But this was different in India and medieval Europe. Although religious ceremonies were extremely important, bathing was regarded as sin. It is said that both during and after bathing, it arouses people's lascivious thoughts. This mentality seems a little different from the mentality of our nation. However, our nation later also stopped loving cleanliness, and also had the habit of taking bathing as an incitement to lust, I don't know if it was influenced by the West.</p>
<p>No matter what, I am ultimately Chinese, and the genetic factor of valuing bathing still flows in my blood. I like bathing. According to my own experience, bathing can reduce people's distracting thoughts and invigorate one's body and mind. It's not good to be presumptuous. Just like a clean handkerchief, when you first get it, you don't want to pollute it casually. Therefore, bathing is inevitably accompanied by mental fasting. That's how I feel it. With such a feeling, to meet with God seems to be really peaceful, even though I myself do not believe in any God.</p>
<p>After bathing, I sat down at the desk under the south window and wrote two letters to my friends in Shanghai. The rain had stopped early, but the weather was gloomy. The undulating Zijin Mountain stood quietly to the west, with one peak particularly sharp, somewhat like Japan's Fuji. I slightly stirred up the interest of climbing. But I also thought that there were many things that should be done, and this leisure mood was only like a faint stroke of beauty.</p>
<p>My stomach was still not very comfortable. Since I didn't eat breakfast, I didn't want to have lunch either, so I simply implemented a fast of abstinence.</p>
<p>There were two beds in the room. I occupied one and lay down on the bed to rest for a few moments. When I woke up, it was almost one o'clock in the afternoon. Director Chunru had made an appointment early in the morning, and I was supposed to visit Mr. Qian Muyin at one o'clock in the afternoon. Before long, Chunru came in a car.</p>
<p>Mr. Muyin is the director of the First Adjutant Office. This was our first meeting. At the first meeting, I felt that Mr. Muyin's body was very tall and sturdy, but his appearance was harmonious. I gave him the letter of introduction written by Cixiu, and also handed over the large package of wool knitting entrusted by Ms. He Xiangning when I came from Shanghai to comfort Mr. Chiang. After exchanging a few polite words, we said goodbye and came out.</p>

<h3>British and French Navies Prepare for Joint Demonstration in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Plan to Occupy Spanish Islands by Peaceful Means; Expressing Determination to Demand Italy Withdraw Volunteers</p>
<p>[Paris] According to reliable sources, Britain and France are considering holding a joint naval demonstration today, or occupying the Spanish island of Minorca by peaceful means. It is claimed that all of the Balearic Islands of Spain, except for Minorca, have been occupied by Italy, so Britain and France are taking this action. It can also express Britain and France's determination to demand Italy withdraw its volunteers. It is understood that in addition to this, Britain and France will also use this to inform the world of the two countries' preparations to protect commercial routes in the Mediterranean (National Telegram on the 12th).</p>
<p>[London] Authoritative sources in London and Paris both believe that if Britain and France do not immediately find a way to restore balance, they may have to take even stronger measures in the future. Judging from the current situation, Italy's refusal to discuss the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain has caused great anxiety among all parties. It is claimed that the French General Staff has stated to Premier Xu Dang that if the Spanish National Army gains victory with the help of foreigners, they cannot be responsible for national defense. At the same time, Britain is also investigating the skills of various workers in all factories across the country, the purpose of which is obviously to manufacture munitions (National Telegram on the 12th).</p>
<h3>Britain and France Confer on Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Italy Increases Troops in Libya; London Feels Unease</p>
<p>[London] After Italy refused to hold talks with Britain and France to discuss the non-interference in the Spanish Civil War issue, the British and French authorities began talks today to discuss countermeasures. French Ambassador Corbin had a lengthy discussion with British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Sir Robert Vansittart, but the exact content was not disclosed. Political observers in Britain believe that the current situation can be compared to the relationship between Britain and Italy when Italy and Abyssinia were at war. In particular, Italy's recent repeated deployment of troops to Italian Libya in North Africa has made Britain feel uneasy. In addition, Italy's activities in the Spanish Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean have also caused unease. Some people advocate proposing to the countries concerned that these islands be placed under international co-management, so that they can be internationalized, and Italy can also participate in it. It is generally believed that the British Cabinet will discuss the issue of Italy increasing troops in Libya and the Balearic Islands at its regular meeting on Wednesday (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th).</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Spanish issue, diplomatic circles here believe that after consultations between Britain and France, the London Adjustment Committee will be convened at the end of this week or the beginning of next week to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries from Spain in order to meet Italy's demands. However, if the countries concerned are still unable to reach a compromise at that time, Britain and France should make their responsibilities clear to the countries concerned and know how to act (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th).</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Express reported that the British government should still adopt a policy of proceeding slowly. The following measures, namely (1) canceling the ban on the transportation of munitions to Spain, (2) Britain and France taking joint action in the Mediterranean, including a movement in which each country controls the island of Minorca belonging to the Spanish Balearic Islands, should all be rejected (Note: Italians are very active in these islands) (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 12th).</p>
<p>[Rome] Italy's recent rapid increase in defense in Libya has aroused general speculation. In the past three weeks, approximately 24,000 soldiers, totaling two divisions, have formally departed for Tripoli. According to official sources, the departure of these troops is in accordance with Mussolini's decision in April to strengthen Libya's garrison to a corps. It is known that Libya already had an Italian army division. Now, another division is being continuously deployed. If the Italian corps is calculated as three divisions in total, the fourth division may be established separately, or it may be sent elsewhere. It is heard that the latest batch of 5,700 people has departed (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 12th).</p>
<h3>The Western Government Sends a Note to Britain, Willing to Withdraw Foreign Volunteer Soldiers</h3>
<p>[London] Last night, the Spanish government sent a note to the British Foreign Office expressing its willingness to withdraw all foreign volunteer soldiers fighting for the Spanish government forces and strongly emphasized its willingness to cooperate with the international community in implementing this withdrawal. As for the definition of "foreigner," it will be based on their native language and authentic official documents, not on whether they possess a Spanish passport. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>German Defense Minister Visits Portuguese Islands</h3>
<p>⊙Lisbon General Blomberg, the German Minister of Defense, recently arrived at Funchal Harbor on the Portuguese island of Madeira in the Atlantic Ocean aboard the small cruiser "Grille" from Germany. He has now left the island to visit Ponta Delgada Harbor in the Portuguese Azores. (Havas Telegram from the Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Economic Self-Sufficiency Movement</h3>
<p>A Four-Year Plan is Drafted and Vigorously Implemented. The Prime Minister Advises the People to Refuse Foreign Goods.</p>
<p>[Rome] Today, Mussolini, in a speech to the Central Corporations Committee of the General Economic Staff, stated that Italy would intensify its movement for self-sufficiency. Mussolini ordered all Italians to tighten their belts and absolutely not use foreign goods. Minister of Corporations Lantini stated that the Central Corporations Committee is currently drafting two plans. The first plan will complete the process of self-sufficiency by 1941, and the second plan will go even further. Furthermore, a semi-official report stated that the number of Italian volunteer soldiers within Spain is actually less than what foreign newspapers have reported, considering the newspapers of democratic countries to be alarmist. In particular, the French press's claim that there are 110,000 Italian troops in Spain is especially bizarre. Furthermore, the Italian side is taking a calm approach to France's threat to open the Franco-Spanish border in the Pyrenees, saying that such a change will be considered with composure. (Reuters Telegram from the Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Belgium Conclude Non-Aggression Pact Through Negotiations</h3>
<p>[London] Germany and Belgium are currently engaged in negotiations to conclude a pact of non-aggression and inviolability. The negotiations are expected to be completed before this Sunday. It is noted that the German leader delivered a speech on January 30 of this year, expressing respect for Belgium's neutral status. These negotiations originated from this speech. However, Belgium considered the term "neutrality" insufficient and replaced it with the term "inviolability." In short, although Belgium refuses to accept any international obligations, it still strives for harmony with the constraints it bears as a member of the League of Nations. This matter further demonstrates this point. (Havas Telegram from the Central News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>Indian National Congress Sympathizes with China's Resistance War</h3>
<p>Passing a Resolution Against Japanese Aggression and Sending a Letter to the Premier's Wife</p>
<p>▲ Central News Agency: Since the full-scale War of Resistance broke out, the Indian people have deeply hated the brutal Japanese aggression and expressed deep sympathy for our country. Recently, the Indian National Congress held demonstrations and rallies, and passed a resolution against Japanese atrocities. The Congress sent a letter to Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, on September 29, expressing sympathy for China's resistance war. The original text of the letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>To Madame Sun, Out of sympathy for the people of your country, our association held a nationwide China Memorial Day on September 26. Under the guidance of our president, Mr. Nehru, demonstrations and rallies were held throughout the country, both in cities and villages, condemning Japan's atrocities in invading China and passing the following three resolutions: ① The war of Japan's aggression against China is a consequence of imperialist policies, and therefore we unanimously recognize Japan as an aggressor. Japan's war of aggression is inhumane, and the Indian people express absolute sympathy for the Chinese people. ② The crisis of a world war is imminent. The challenges of imperialism and fascism to Abyssinia and China are clear evidence. The Indian people are determined to refuse to follow in the footsteps of Italy in participating in wars of aggression in the future. ③ (Omitted). The new offensive of Japanese aggression in North China has shocked the Indian people. We deeply sympathize with your people's heroic struggle for freedom. Lohia, Secretary of the Indian National Congress.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Unpopular Japanese Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>"Facts are most eloquent." Those Japanese politicians who rely on the military's every whim, trying their utmost to prove the legitimacy of their acts of aggression, fabricating distorted diplomatic theories, and promoting cunning propaganda policies, are ultimately working in vain.</p>
<p>According to a statement by a foreign observer who recently arrived in China from Tokyo, published by the Central News Agency, "Japan's invasion of China this time has been costly and fruitless. The people are resentful, and the prestige of the military has been swept away, blaming diplomacy and attacking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for failing to fulfill its responsibilities, causing Japanese troops to sacrifice their lives and flesh, but instead being condemned internationally." Everyone knows that international condemnation of Japan is caused by the ironclad facts of aggression. Japan has long abandoned international credibility. How can any flowery words from its diplomatic officials divert international attention? However, facing our country's unexpectedly strong resistance, the Japanese military will certainly not think so. The Japanese Foreign Minister is truly pitiful.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned phenomenon of political infighting is a natural consequence of the development of war. We can predict that, on the Japanese side, the longer the war lasts, the more the military's paper tiger will be exposed, the more isolated its international position will become, and the more serious the domestic crisis will be. As for our country, the opposite is true. The longer the war lasts, the more obvious the national glory will become, the higher the international status will rise, and the more solid the domestic unity will be.</p>
<p>The truth that final victory will be on our side lies in this.</p>
<h3>Diary of a War Correspondent (5)</h3>
<p>— Chen Wanli, Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency</p>
<p>October 9th</p>
<p>The sky is gloomy, and it is constantly drizzling. I cannot see the planes that I am accustomed to seeing every day, and I cannot hear the roar that I am accustomed to hearing every day. Except for the monotonous sound of dripping rain, the earth is as silent as death.</p>
<p>Although the war is still continuing along the banks of the Wenzaobang, other fronts are very calm. Only the warning gunshots of the sentries occasionally break the deathly silence.</p>
<p>Here, as long as you step out of the house, it is all mud, sinking deeply into your ankles, so muddy that you cannot stand still. In this situation of "difficult to move an inch," I often think of the water in the trenches, the people in the rain, and the hand-to-hand combat in the muddy fields... These, these, constantly appear in my mind. Truly, just thinking about the soldiers on the front line in the heavy rain, even though the mud often soaks their shoes and feet, I always feel that I am too fortunate.</p>
<p>Today, I saw many enemy rifles and steel helmets again. These things are spoils of war that we often obtain. It is said that as long as the enemy infantry has a slight contact with our infantry, they will throw away all their belongings and flee in a hurry. The rifle is the first thing they lose, so it has become the largest part of our spoils of war.</p>
<p>October 10th</p>
<p>I have been sleeping soundly these past few nights because there have been no airplanes or artillery fire disturbing me. When I woke up this morning, it was already half past seven. I saw that the drizzle was still continuing to fall. The gloomy weather did not clear up for our National Day, but my heart was still full of sunshine, very happy and excited.</p>
<p>Our blood debts with the enemy for many years have begun to be settled on today's Double Tenth National Day. The enemy's fourth general offensive was ordered to occupy our Shanghai by today, but today, today has finally arrived. Our loyal soldiers are still holding on to their original positions without the slightest wavering. Can we lightly let go of this memorable day? Although the sky is so gloomy and the rain is still falling,</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I bought twenty coppers worth of shochu and ten coppers worth of peanuts, and drank happily alone in the damp room. The dripping rain outside the door also served as "jazz." This is the only way to celebrate here. I am thinking of my friends at sea, how will they spend this Double Tenth?</p>
<p>The front line is still very silent today because of the continuous rain in recent days, which has caused great difficulties in combat.</p>
<p>October 11th</p>
<p>The weather is clear, and when I woke up this morning, I saw weak sunlight. Soon, I heard the buzzing of airplanes, disturbing the air that had been calm for many days. Fierce fighting broke out again along the banks of the Wenzaobang. The enemies crossing the river in the Tangqiao area attempted to advance further west. This is their consistent strategy of central breakthrough, but they were finally intercepted by us and failed to advance an inch westward, and also suffered a major blow. At the same time, fierce battles also occurred in the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas. The rattling machine guns and rumbling artillery fire intermittently struck the eardrums.</p>
<p>Today, I chatted with an old farmer in his sixties who lives here. He told me that this year's cotton harvest was abundant. Although it was raining when the flowers were blooming, each acre still had a harvest of about one load of cotton. However, because of the enemy's war of aggression, the cotton is piled up at home and cannot be sold. While drinking rice porridge, the old farmer looked at the enemy planes flying overhead. I could see that his eyes were full of hatred.</p>
<p>It is almost midnight now. As I am writing my diary, the wind has picked up again, and the fierce wind is coming from outside the door, sounding a bit scary. However, it still cannot cover the dense artillery fire. I thought of the brothers in the trenches, wearing damp clothes, experiencing the blowing of the gale, and could not help but shiver. Compatriots across the country, remember the winter clothes of the soldiers on the front line! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Refugee Relief Association Telegraphs Nine Counties to Accept Refugees</h3>
<p>Accommodating the Displaced According to Ability and Preparing to Accommodate as Much as Possible by a Set Date</p>
<p>The Relief Committee for War Zone Refugees of the United Relief Association of Charitable Organizations in this city believes that the refugee shelters have already taken in more than 40,000 refugees. Not only is the supply huge, but it will be impossible to accommodate refugees later. Therefore, it telegraphed Yu Jingtang, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the Refugee Relief Association during Extraordinary Times, a few days ago to instruct the counties to find ways to accommodate them. The association received a reply from Yu yesterday, which said, "I have learned from the Dongdai Telegraph that your association is enthusiastic about relief and your virtuous efforts are exhaustive. I am deeply impressed by the lower wind. I will do my best to arrange for the displaced, so as to fulfill my ambition. I have already telegraphed Wu County, Wuxi, Wujin, Danyang, Yixing, Jintan, and other nine counties to prepare by a set date and accommodate as much as possible according to their ability. Please also ask Cheng Jingsheng, director of the relief group of our association, to go to the Songhu area as soon as possible to discuss matters. Knowing the Jin Note, I respectfully reply."</p>

<h3>The Chinese Buddhist Association Calls for Sanctions Against Brutal Japan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram was sent to Viscount Cecil, requesting legal discussion in the League of Nations and various countries.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Buddhist Association sent a telegram to Viscount Cecil of the International Peace Conference, requesting that he propose to the League of Nations and other countries to implement economic sanctions against Japan. The original text is excerpted as follows: One, Ambassador Guo of the London Embassy in the United Kingdom, please forward it to Viscount Cecil of the International Peace Conference. Japanese militarists, after continuously invading China for six years, are now even more wantonly poisoning China's territory, bombing cities unrelated to military affairs, non-combatant people, and escort team members, and refugees being sent back to their hometowns, regardless of international treaties and credibility. The consequences of their atrocities have left a stain on world civilization. This meeting sincerely thanks you for your advocacy of justice and your association's sympathy for China. We firmly believe that countries that uphold peace, if they can collectively impose de facto sanctions on the aggressor, will be able to achieve their effects in a short period of time. In order to demand an early end to the war, so as to avoid disasters from spreading to the world, we respectfully request your association to recommend that the League of Nations and other countries implement economic sanctions against Japan, so that Japan can feel economic constraints when carrying out aggression and slaughter, which is an effective way to stop atrocities and uphold peace. We sincerely hope that your association will strive to promote its realization. We wish your association success. Yuan Ying, Dubei, Changxing, Wang Yiting, Zhu Qinglan, Ye Gongchuo, Guan Tong, Huang Qinglan, and Qu Yingguang of the Chinese Buddhist Association bow down. It is also heard that the association has collected many photos of the Japanese army massacring civilians and sent them to Buddhist groups in various countries, requesting unanimous moral support.</p>

<h3>Fujian Native Association Hosts Banquet for Sa Zhenbing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Representing the people of Min to comfort the soldiers. Encouragement for national salvation in light of the current situation.</p>
<p>The Fujian Native Association in Shanghai held a welcome reception yesterday from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM at the 6th floor of the Pudong Mansion to welcome Sa Zhenbing, a renowned naval figure and representative of Fujian Province, who came to Shanghai to comfort the troops, as well as Shi Jialin, Gao Lu, Liu Tong, and others. More than 60 people from Fujian, including Jiangnan and Sa Fuchou, attended. Chairman Jiangnan delivered a speech. Sa Zhenbing then rose and gave a reply, stating: "Brothers, representing the Fujian Provincial Anti-Enemy Support Association, have come to Shanghai to comfort the soldiers at the front. However, as I am unable to go to the front lines in person, I feel truly uneasy. Moreover, upon arriving in Shanghai, I did not immediately pay respects to the Native Association, which I deeply regret. This time, Japan's invasion of our territory brings no real benefit to their country. Before the war started, Japan had a lot of commercial operations in China and made a lot of revenue and a lot of benefit. After the war, the situation changed a lot, Japan's troops will find it hard to achieve their goal. We should have the determination from beginning to end. No matter how fierce their weapons are, we are not afraid. If this continues, Japan will inevitably fall into national economic bankruptcy and domestic chaos, and they will meet their own doom. Finally, I wish all fellow Fujianese and all guests good health." Sa Zhenbing, who came to Shanghai, has a seven-character quatrain about his views on the current situation. The poem says: "The first martial disaster is because of seeking to expand territory, soldiers have no fighting spirit, it is difficult to fulfill their wishes, the whole country saves itself with one heart, even if it dies, it will still leave a last name."</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department Issues Ten Questions and Answers on Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Arousing the people to fight to preserve national life. Those with money should contribute money, those with heart should contribute heart, and those with strength should contribute strength.</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department of this city, in order to increase the strength of resistance against the enemy and seek final victory, yesterday specially issued ten questions and answers on resistance against Japan, instructing all mass organizations to widely disseminate them to arouse the people to fight together. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1) Why must we resist Japan now? Japan wants to destroy our country. We have endured to the point of being unable to endure any further. We cannot live without resisting. Therefore, we must rise up and resist Japan.</p>
<p>2) Is it possible not to resist Japan? No, it is not. Not resisting Japan means becoming a subjugated slave. Not only will you become a subjugated slave, but your children and grandchildren will also be subjugated slaves.</p>
<p>3) What does it mean to be a subjugated slave? A subjugated slave is like the people of Korea and Taiwan, subject to being bullied, robbed, and slaughtered. The graves of ancestors cannot be protected, farmlands and houses cannot be protected, and gold and silver cannot be protected. Life is truly worse than that of pigs and dogs.</p>
<p>4) How can we avoid becoming subjugated slaves? Only by trusting our central government, helping our national army, and supporting our military leaders, and by everyone rising up to resist Japan, can we avoid becoming subjugated slaves.</p>
<p>5) What does it mean to trust the government, help the army, and support the leaders?</p>
<p>Do not spread rumors that are not true to others.</p>
<p>6) To make everyone rise up to resist Japan together, what should we do besides not creating rumors and not listening to rumors?</p>
<p>Those with money should contribute money, those with heart should contribute heart, and those with strength should contribute strength.</p>
<p>7) What does it mean to contribute money? It means taking out all your money, jewelry, scrap metal, food, or goods, whatever the country needs, without being stingy, willingly, and even voluntarily, to contribute to the country.</p>
<p>8) What does it mean to contribute heart? For the sake of victory in resisting Japan, for the survival of the country, and for the sake of our children and grandchildren not becoming subjugated slaves, we must use all our minds to think of various ways to maintain social order and stop the activities of traitors. We must also not be afraid of danger or sacrifice, but help our national army fight and eliminate the enemy's strength. We are willing to sacrifice our own lives in exchange for the country's thousands upon thousands of years of life.</p>
<p>9) What does it mean to contribute strength? When the country is at war, it needs goods and food even more. We workers should not be afraid of danger, work hard, and produce more. We farmers should work harder than usual to cultivate and produce more food. We merchants should maintain the market and continue business as usual, and must not raise prices. This is what it means to contribute strength and resist Japan together.</p>
<p>10) What should we do after reading the questions and answers on resisting Japan and saving the country?</p>
<p>We must remember every point in our hearts and put them into practice. If we do not put them into practice, then we are letting down the country and are not worthy of being Chinese citizens.</p>
<h3>Boy Scout Zhang Haigen Dies in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Haigen, a member of the Shanghai Shaoyong Sports Association, the 2149th Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts, Special Task Force, went to the front lines to comfort the soldiers on Double Ten Day under heavy fire. Unfortunately, he was shot and died at 8:30 PM that afternoon despite emergency treatment. Mr. Zhang was only seventeen years old, his patriotic enthusiasm is commendable. Unfortunately, he died for the country, and all who heard the news mourned him. Also, due to the team's busy work, it is now planning to recruit 100 more male and female team members. Those who are interested in joining should bring their own Boy Scout uniform, five two-inch photos, and pay a processing fee of one yuan.

<h3>After Our Troops Smashed the Main Force of the Enemy on the South Bank of the Wenzaobang, We Took Advantage of the Victory to Counterattack and Force the Enemy to Retreat to the Riverbank</h3>
<p>Enemy Remnants Dig Trenches and Hold Out in the Black Dahuan Residence. Enemy Ships Gather at Baimao Estuary, Our Surveillance is Very Strict. In Jiangwan, We Pounced on the Enemy's Base, Killing More Than a Hundred People. Enemy Planes Slaughtered Civilians Again This Morning.</p>
<p>This afternoon, the military authority received the following front-line war reports: 1) The enemy troops on the south bank of the Wenzaobang, after being severely attacked by our troops head-on, were defeated and became disorganized. Our army took advantage of the victory to counterattack and forced the enemy to retreat to the area of Black Dahuan Residence, Baju Residence, Yang Residence, and Zhao Family Residence. The remnants are now digging trenches and hiding deeply in that area, counterattacking to defend themselves. Our army is actively advancing to annihilate them all. 2) North of Guangfu Town, there were occasional minor engagements, with no fierce battles. 3) Between Yanglinkou and Liuhe, there were thirteen enemy warships and three transport ships. Between Yanglinkou and Langgan Estuary, there were nine enemy warships and eight transport ships. Subsequently, the number of enemy ships in that area increased to twenty-nine warships and twenty-three transport ships. On the 11th, they attempted to land but were repelled by our attack. On the 12th, most of them sailed to the vicinity of Baimao Estuary. Our army is closely monitoring them. If they attempt to land, they will certainly not succeed. 4) In the area of Cao Wang Temple to Shi Xiangong Temple, our army is still firmly defending its original positions. Although enemy planes and artillery occasionally harass, the infantry has never dared to attack. 5) In the Eight Character Bridge area of Zhabei, a small part of the enemy troops attacked last night but were blocked and driven back.</p>
<h3>Main Force of the Enemy on the South Bank of Wenzaobang Fought Fiercely, Our Army Took Advantage of the Victory to Mop Up the Remnants</h3>
<p>The enemy troops west of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway on the south bank of the Wenzaobang were fiercely counterattacked yesterday by our army, resulting in the annihilation of approximately 5,000 enemy soldiers and the defeat of their main force. Taking advantage of the victory, our army swept away the enemy to the areas along the bank of the Black Dahuan Residence, Baju Residence, Yang Residence, and Zhao Family Residence. At this moment, the enemy remnants are digging trenches and hiding deeply in that area, stubbornly trying to defend themselves. Our army is actively advancing, determined to annihilate all of them.</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 12th Dispatch: Military information 1) On the 12th, on both banks of the Wenzaobang, the enemy continued to attack fiercely, and the fighting was intense. Our army met the enemy head-on with repeated counterattacks, finally repelling the stubborn enemy, and the front line remained steadfast and unmoved, and is currently still in a stalemate. 2) On the 12th, the attack was very fierce in the Guangfu area. Approximately one battalion of enemy troops attacked and advanced, but they were repelled by our army. 3) There were more than fifty enemy warships and transport ships in Liuhe. One large ship arrived on the evening of the 11th and began landing at 6:00 PM that evening, landing a total of four times, and was repelled by our army in a fierce battle lasting one hour. Not only did the enemy fail to land, but two smaller ships were overturned by our attack, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. On the morning of the 12th, the enemy ships had sailed to the Qiyakou area of Rimao in the lower reaches and fired four to five hundred rounds of artillery shells at the shore, but the enemy soldiers remained on board and did not move. 4) Before dawn on the 11th, approximately one company of the enemy secretly crossed in front of our Luzhai position and was repelled by our defending soldiers, killing thirty to forty enemy soldiers, including the body of Captain Hayashi of the 36th Regiment. Three enemy soldiers were also captured, and an enemy military order was seized, revealing the enemy's intention to break through our Guangfu front line before the 9th, 10th, and 11th. 5) On the morning of the 9th, the enemy used fierce artillery fire to bombard our Zhoujiazhai forward position, first launching a fierce attack with more than 300 infantry soldiers, which continued to increase to over 1,000. Our defending soldiers, consisting of only two infantry companies and one machine gun company, fought bravely and stubbornly defended their position, resulting in being surrounded. In this battle, the battalion commander of that battalion, Zhang Qingtao, and six company and platoon leaders were seriously injured, and the battalion adjutant Yuan Zhi and a total of four company and platoon leaders were killed in action, with more than seventy soldiers wounded and more than sixty killed in action.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Correspondent with the Army, Report at 10:25 AM on the 13th: One part of the enemy force that crossed the Wenzaobang from Jiangjiazhai was encircled by our three sides and still tried to fight. They tried to break out four times yesterday, but none of them succeeded. The enemy attacked again before dawn today. Our army immediately counterattacked bravely, and after a fierce battle of about an hour, the enemy army was unable to support, and retreated into the trenches. In this battle, over seventy enemy soldiers were killed, and seven light machine guns, over thirty rifles and countless other spoils of war were seized. The enemy that crossed over from the East Yangzhai has been annihilated for the most part, after continuous attacks by our troops. Only a few remnants are now remaining, holed up in the Gujiazhai, attempting a last ditch struggle. This morning we launched another close attack, the enemy soldiers were extremely miserable and have lost the ability to make any sound.</p>
<h3>Most of the Enemy Ships Gathered at Baimao</h3>
<p>Dozens of enemy ships in the Huangpu River have been sailing to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River for days, gathering at various ports, seemingly with the intention of continuing to land. The report from Chongming Island states that there are thirteen warships and three transport ships between Yanglinkou and Liuhe, and nine warships and eight transport ships from Yanglinkou to Langyan Estuary, totaling twenty-two warships and fifteen transport ships. Subsequently, seven warships and six transport ships were transferred, totaling fifty-two ships. Our army immediately stepped up its defenses. On the evening of the 11th, the enemy ships released smoke screens above the various ports above the Liuhe Estuary, covering their attempt to force a crossing. Finally, our dense machine gun fire repelled the enemy. The enemy's plan failed. Yesterday (the 12th), most of them sailed north to the vicinity of Baimao Estuary. Our army is closely monitoring them.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Correspondent with the Army in Guangfu, Report at 12:45 PM on the 13th: More than twenty enemy ships are anchored outside the Baimao Estuary. Last night, they shelled the shore with artillery, covering dozens of their speedboats as they sailed towards the shore, seemingly testing our army's strength and attempting to land. Our machine guns and small artillery fiercely attacked them. After holding out all night, we repelled the enemy. By 3:00 AM this morning, most of the enemy ships had sailed downstream. However, our army is still closely monitoring them.</p>
<h3>Our Army Launches Two-Pronged Attack in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Directly Assaulting the Enemy Base at Sijing Stadium. After a Stalemate of One Hour, More Than a Hundred Enemy Soldiers Were Killed</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Military Correspondent in Jiangwan, Report at 1:20 PM Today: A fierce battle took place south of Sijing Stadium last night. Our army launched an attack and achieved considerable success. By 3:00 AM this morning, it had approached the enemy base at Sijing Stadium in two directions. The enemy, feeling extremely pressured, exerted all its strength and repeatedly charged our army. The two sides engaged in close combat and began a melee with bayonets. The sound of guns and cannons temporarily subsided, and only the sound of battle cries shook the earth. After a stalemate of three hours, the enemy suffered more than 170 casualties and finally could not hold out, and were forced back into their positions. In order to prevent our army from continuing to advance, the enemy urgently dispatched more than a dozen tanks from the city center area to bombard our rear flanks. Their artillery fire was extremely fierce, so our forward troops gradually retreated and continued to firmly defend their original positions. After this sweeping attack by our army, the enemy's morale has been shaken. Our army will continue to adopt a preemptive strategy, striving to drive the enemy away.</p>
<h3>A Major Battle Will Unfold in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Enemy Has Gathered Tanks and Is Very Active</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Military Correspondent in Zhabei, Report at 1:20 PM Today: Starting from 5:00 AM this morning, more than twenty enemy planes have been active over Zhabei. The bombs they dropped were even more numerous than yesterday. Their bombing targets are still the Tanziawan, Gonghe Road, Baoshan Road, and Dongbaoxing Road areas. According to observations, the enemy will be active on this line, and a major battle will unfold within days. Also, on the Jiangwan Road, Qujiaqiao area, there are also many enemy tanks repeatedly driving to the Baziqiao, Shuidian Road area to spy, which is a sign that the enemy will launch a large-scale attack. However, our army has been closely guarding against it.</p>
<h3>The Enemy in Yinhang Has Attacked Several Times</h3>
<p>Our Machine Guns Swept, the Enemy Collapsed and Retreat</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Military Correspondent in Jiangwan, Report at 10:35 AM Today: The enemy in the Yinhang area has attacked our Dongqiao Residence to Sunjia Residence areas several times since last night until this morning. Judging by their intentions, they seem to be trying to relieve the siege of the remaining enemy in Dongyang Residence. However, our army is closely guarding against it, and as soon as the enemy approaches, we will sweep them with machine guns. The enemy finally could not withstand the attacks and retreated in disarray.</p>
<h3>Enemy Large Aircraft Fly Over Our Positions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Military Correspondent in Guangfu, Report at 12:45 PM on the 13th: The enemy planes that have been flying over our positions for the past two days are large, three-engine aircraft, completely silver in color, and appear to be all-metal. They fly with a very low sound, seemingly equipped with sound suppression devices, and are the enemy's newest type of aircraft. This morning, several more of these aircraft scouted near Jiading and dropped multiple bombs.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Constructs Fortifications in Zhouzhai</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Military Correspondent in Fuguan, Report at 12:45 PM on the 13th: Yesterday, a part of the enemy force, approximately five to six hundred people, was constructing fortifications in the North-South Zhouzhai area, approximately one kilometer west of the Luodian-Jiading Highway. There have been no other unusual movements yet. However, at night, the enemy attacked the Sucun area but was immediately repelled by our forces. The enemy that harassed the Xiaojiazhai area was also defeated by our forces in the evening.</p>
<h3>The Artillery Battle in the Huangpu River Has Become Quiet</h3>
<p>The results of the artillery battle between our army in Pudong and the enemy ships in the Huangpu River over the past three days have proven that the enemy has suffered heavy and significant damage. It is estimated that the enemy ships fired over a thousand shells, and the damage suffered by our side was only a few small craters in the open fields and the collapse of some civilian houses. Our military suffered absolutely no damage. Conversely, although our side fired fewer shells, we repeatedly hit enemy ship targets, especially in the areas of Hongkou and Yangshupu, where the enemy's positions suffered the most damage. After suffering a disastrous defeat, the enemy had no choice but to stop the bombardment, so the battle has become quiet again. Last night, there was only sparse artillery fire, and there were no violent actions. However, to prevent our army from launching a night attack, the enemy used machine guns to sweep along the coast of the Huangpu River from time to time, once every two or thirty minutes. The sound of gunfire in the Huangpu River never stopped all night.</p>
<h3>Our Army Damaged an Enemy Plane</h3>
<p>At 5:00 AM this morning, our right-wing artillery demonstrated its power, bombarding enemy positions and enemy headquarters, scoring many hits. Soon after, an enemy reconnaissance plane flew over the North Station and Baoshan Road areas to scout. At that time, the sky had just begun to brighten, and our defending soldiers did not move, waiting for it to fly within the air defense line, and then using anti-aircraft machine guns and other weapons to launch a fierce sweep. The plane was immediately hit and made a strange noise, struggling to fly away and escape. However, because it was badly damaged, it was unable to do so. Then, the plane dropped a few small bombs it was carrying to reduce its weight, and then barely managed to fly high and escape. The time was 5:41 AM. After a while, a large number of enemy planes flew over and dropped huge bombs indiscriminately, and our air defense units also used anti-aircraft guns and machine guns to launch a dense attack. Because of the lesson learned from the previous plane, the enemy planes did not dare to fly low. They flew so high that looking up at the sky, they were only the size of locusts. From this, it can be seen that although they dropped bombs, they were indiscriminate and had no target.</p>
<h3>Disregarding International Condemnation, Enemy Planes Slaughter Civilians Again</h3>
<p>Heavy bombers set out in formation this morning, dropping giant bombs and brutally killing innocent people, resulting in heavy casualties. The enemy's actions are cruel and inhumane.</p>
<p>The weather was clear this morning. Enemy planes stirred up trouble as early as dawn. At around 8:00 AM, a total of twenty-two enemy planes dropped over a dozen bombs in the Beixinjing and Luo Biegen Road area, destroying nine civilian houses, killing three civilians, and injuring five. Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong were also bombed. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Multiple Bombs Dropped on Beixinjing Town</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM this morning, more than ten enemy planes flew to the northwest of Shanghai, the town of Beixinjing, and dropped twelve bombs (each estimated to weigh over 200 kilograms), destroying more than ten civilian houses and killing or injuring seven or eight villagers. After the incident, the Changjing Rescue Team received the news and rushed to the scene to provide assistance, burying the dead and transporting the injured to Shanghai for medical treatment. At the same time, the Huacao Township area in western Shanghai was also bombarded by enemy giant bombs, and vegetable vendor Zhang Xiaodi (age 51) was injured in the waist, Zhao Guanghua (age 43) was injured in the left rib, and Xue Renxi (age 32) was injured in the back. Their injuries were very serious. The rescue team later transported the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Heavy Bombers Fly South in Formation</p>
<p>At around 7:00 AM this morning, a large number of enemy heavy bombers, twenty-four in total, flew south in two formations from the east, flying along the river. They then flew back and forth in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road area. At Zhongshan Road, one formation of eight planes turned northwest, then bombed indiscriminately along the way in Xujiahui, Beixinjing, Caojiadu, and Zhenru, dropping giant bombs and indiscriminately killing our innocent civilians and destroying civilian houses. The planes then flew to the Zhabei area and continued to bomb the North Station and Baoshan Road in Zhabei. The remaining two formations of enemy planes continued to fly southwest along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, presumably to carry out more indiscriminate slaughter of our inland villagers.</p>
<p>Civilian Casualties in Pudong</p>
<p>Six enemy planes flew to Pudong at 8:00 AM this morning and bombed the area extensively, dropping as many as ten bombs. The bombing area was concentrated around Lan Nidu, Yangjiadu, and Tangqiao, destroying many civilian houses and causing casualties to more than a dozen innocent civilians. Two enemy planes then flew to the Nanshi Waitan Road and dropped a bomb, reconnoitering for a long time before leaving.</p>
<p>Giant Bombs Dropped in Zhabei</p>
<p>Starting from around 5:00 AM this morning, the enemy forces in the Zhabei Baziqiao, Japanese Cemetery, Liu San Garden, and Jiangwan Road areas first indiscriminately bombarded our garrison positions with artillery. Our army responded in kind. At 5:50 AM, enemy planes began to fly out one after another. At first, there was only one, which flew over Zhabei and dropped a heavy bomb after circling. After 6:00 AM, a large number of enemy planes flew out from the Yangshupu area. By 6:45 AM, there were nine formations, each with three planes, and many other groups of two planes each. They all dropped bombs over Zhabei and the Pengpu, Xinqiao West, and Pengyong Bus Station areas of the Northwest Shanghai-Taicang Road, causing the sky over Zhabei to be filled with rumbling sounds. However, the bombs dropped in the Shanghai-Taicang Road area all landed in the fields, so few of them exploded. After 7:00 AM, three enemy planes flew in formation over the North Railway Station and dropped a giant bomb each, but none of them exploded. Until 8:45 AM, the large number of enemy planes had exhausted their bombs and then flew back to the Yangshupu area one after another. It is estimated that within these few hours, approximately thirty enemy planes dropped no less than a hundred bombs, but only twenty or thirty of them exploded. The rest were wasted. Only a few civilian houses were destroyed, and there was no other damage. As of the time this reporter was writing, some later enemy planes were still bombing.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Attacks Dagu</h3>
<p>Five Bombers Dropped Multiple Bombs. When They Made Medicals, The Japanese Flags Were Hurriedly Pulled Down.</p>
<p>[Tianjin] According to Japanese reports, the Chinese Air Force suddenly attacked Dagu yesterday afternoon. Five bombers dropped four bombs at 2:15 PM. According to foreign reports from Dagu, the Chinese planes came from the north and south, dropping at least eight bombs on both sides of the river. No foreigners were injured. When the planes attacked, many Japanese flags were hastily pulled down. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 13th).</p>
<h3>More than Twenty Enemy Planes Bomb Pingding and Other Places</h3>
<p>Our Air Force Arrives in Shandong to Assist in the Battle</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] At 6:45 AM on the 12th, more than twenty enemy planes flew to Ding County, Niangziguan, and other places, flying west along the Zhengtai Railway and bombing Pingding, Shouyang, Yuci, and other places. At 10:30 AM, five more enemy planes came, three flying over the city of Bing and circling once before heading east, and two flying to Huangzhai in Xin County and then fleeing north. (Central News Agency, 12th).</p>
<p>[Jinan] Nine of our planes arrived in Shandong on the 12th to assist in the battle. (Central News Agency, 12th).</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attempted to Bomb Nanjing This Morning, but Failed</h3>
<p>Another Air Raid Warning at 1:00 PM</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At 9:25 AM this morning, three enemy planes flew to Nanjing to attempt to bomb, flying over Longtan, but were repelled by our air force. The air raid warning was lifted at 10:05 AM. A second air raid warning was issued at 1:30 PM, as multiple enemy planes attempted to bomb. As of the time of this dispatch, the air raid warning had not been lifted. (Emergency Dispatch, 2:00 PM on the 13th).</p>
<h3>The Nine-Power Treaty Conference May Be Held Shortly</h3>
<p>British and Belgian Ambassadors In Contact With Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs; Australian Dockworkers Boycott Japanese Ships</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the convocation of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the State Department authorities have been in contact with personnel from the British Embassy since last week. The American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Bingham, who recently returned home to report on his duties, also participated in the matter. According to a statement made to the press by Bingham, this conference should be held in the near future, and he has already received final instructions from President Roosevelt and will soon return to his post in London. (Central News Agency, Havana, 12th)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt recently convened Congress to hold a special session on the 15th of next month. Although the President has refused to indicate the purpose of this move, he will deliver a radio address tonight to explain the work of the special session of Congress. (Central News Agency, Havana, 12th)</p>
<p>[London] The British League of Nations Society held a special meeting today and passed a resolution requesting the government to do its utmost to cooperate fully with the United States and other member states of the League of Nations to take all appropriate measures to stop Japan's aggression against China. The best measure would be to exert economic pressure on Japan, specifically, by prohibiting all countries from importing Japanese goods and people, and prohibiting their own merchants from transporting military supplies, including coal and oil, to Japan. In addition, the Society also advocated that British athletes refuse to participate in the 1940 Olympic Games in Tokyo to express their opposition to Japanese aggression. (Central News Agency, Havana, 12th)</p>
<p>⊙Fremantle, Australia: Dockworkers in Fremantle, Western Australia, have now begun to seal off a fleet of Japanese whaling ships, refusing to load coal and transport their goods, in accordance with a recent resolution by the Australian Dockworkers' Union to boycott Japanese goods. As a result, the whaling fleet quietly left Australia and headed south, planning to obtain fuel from a factory ship directly from Japan on a certain island in Antarctica. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Belgian Ambassador to Japan, Bassompierre, visited Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kyōnai, in the afternoon to exchange information on the situation in China. Ambassador Bassompierre also met with Horiuchi to have similar discussions. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Transportation Unobstructed</h3>
<p>Via Hong Kong; Land and Water Routes Open</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, since the enemy navy harassed the coast of Guangdong Province and Humen was declared closed on the 1st of this month, direct sea transportation between Shanghai and Guangzhou has been interrupted. Navigation routes between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, Wuzhou, Jiangmen, and other places have also been suspended. However, the transportation of goods and passengers by land, relying on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and by water, relying on inland river ferries, continues as usual. As for those traveling by sea from Shanghai to Guangdong, transferring through Hong Kong remains unobstructed. Therefore, freight transportation between Shanghai and Guangdong has not been completely blocked, only slightly affected by time delays. Recently, the enemy navy has been rampant in the South Seas, increasing its brutality, attacking and destroying fishing boats regardless of the circumstances, resulting in the deaths and injuries of four to five thousand fishermen. This brutal behavior is truly appalling. Foreign shipping companies in Hong Kong have completely suspended all routes to Guangdong Province due to the enemy navy's atrocities and are now requesting the Hong Kong authorities to stop the enemy navy from indiscriminately bombarding ships in order to maintain their operations.</p>
<h3>Swire Chinese Staff Enthusiastically Support National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Yang Meinan Donates 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The entire Chinese staff of the British Swire Shipping Company has never lagged behind others in acts of righteousness since the start of the War of Resistance, such as contributing to national salvation donations, comforting frontline soldiers, comforting wounded soldiers, and donating medicine bags. Their enthusiasm is commendable. Yesterday, Yang Meinan, the Chinese general manager of the company, took the lead and subscribed to 3,000 yuan of national salvation bonds. The entire Chinese staff subscribed enthusiastically, and Mr. Chen Jichu, Mr. Li Fengqi, and others were responsible for persuading compradors and sailors to subscribe. The results in the future will certainly be considerable.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Urges Removal of Goods Stored in Warehouses</h3>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has warehouses, except for the South Warehouse, which are mostly located in war zones. A large number of imported goods stored in these warehouses, as well as goods returned from the fourteenth export shipment, have not yet been picked up. Given the current extraordinary times, it is difficult to store them for a long time. Therefore, the company hereby notifies all customers storing goods to find a way to pick them up from the warehouses themselves to avoid losses. The company will provide customers with convenience to the extent possible.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Comments</h3>
<p>— A Coincidence</p>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador, was injured by Japanese machine gun fire on his way from Beijing to Shanghai the other day. He recovered after more than a month of treatment. He recently went to Batavia to recuperate. Unexpectedly, Ma Rui, the military attaché of the British Embassy, and four others, drove three cars from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday. When they passed Pengqiao in the Shanghai County suburbs, six enemy planes strafed them. Fortunately, Mr. Rui and others were able to seek refuge in trenches with the assistance of a local squire, and they escaped unharmed. British Embassy personnel have repeatedly been strafed by enemy planes. It seems that the enemy is deliberately "teasing" the British Embassy personnel. Any car they happen to see cannot escape unharmed.</p>
<p>However, there are three points that deserve attention. First, Mr. Ma Rui's car had a large British flag on the roof. Could the pilot be so shortsighted that he did not see the small flag? Second, when Mr. Ma Rui was traveling, he had informally notified the Japanese side to pay attention. Could the enemy claim that they had not heard about it? Third, after Sir Archibald Kerr was injured, the British authorities lodged a serious protest. The Japanese also replied that they would take measures to avoid similar incidents in the future. But now the same thing has happened again. In the end, do enemy planes attack any car regardless of its nationality? Or are they deliberately making trouble for British people? This should be inquired of the enemy military authorities. What exactly is their intention?</p>

<h3>New Rice Market in This City</h3>
<p>Low Prices and Smooth Sales; Promotion of Planting in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui</p>
<p>Since the start of the War of Resistance, the city's food supply has been regulated by the Civil Food Regulation Committee, and the source and market price of rice have been stable. According to news from the rice industry by a reporter from Xin Xin News Agency, the city's rice, planned and arranged by the Civil Food Regulation Committee, has a first-class rice selling price of 14.4 yuan. Not only is the selling price balanced, so that unscrupulous merchants have no way to manipulate it, but also the source is smooth and the stock is very sufficient. This is a good sign for the future of civil food during the War of Resistance. The new rice from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has already entered the market, and the first batch has been purchased by the Regulation Committee from the production areas and transported to Shanghai. The selling price is also lower than the old rice by 20 to 30 cents. According to estimates of the yields in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year, there is a 70 to 80 percent harvest. The production areas in Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces are even better than Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the central government has also ordered agricultural authorities to promote food planting in the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. This is now being implemented separately to expand the planting of wheat. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, there is no need to worry about civil food.</p>
<h3>Changshu County Illegally Detains Rice; Chamber of Commerce Requests Compensation</h3>
<p>Disobeying Court Orders and Handling Cases Wantonly; Telegram to the Executive Yuan for Strict Investigation and Punishment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan yesterday, requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and return the two shi of glutinous rice confiscated by Changshu County and its funds. The original telegram stated: "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan, (omitted above) It has been verified that the city's rice supply has always relied on various counties in Jiangsu Province. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the number of people from neighboring counties seeking refuge in Shanghai has suddenly increased, and transportation has been blocked, resulting in a stagnant source of supply. Therefore, the military and political organs of this city have jointly organized a Civil Food Regulation Committee with commercial groups to facilitate the supply of civil food, while also containing the significance of control and prevention. When rice merchant Shi Xiaofu and others went to Changshu to buy glutinous rice, they presented a certificate issued by the Civil Food Regulation Committee, proving that it was a legitimate trade without any illegal intentions. This can be used as strict proof. Moreover, it has been verified that in September, Your Yuan secretly telegraphed that 'in order to regulate the circulation of military and civilian food throughout the country, provinces and counties shall not arbitrarily prohibit the export of food.' Therefore, the Changshu County government confiscated the food rice after the Mo City water police escorted the rice boat. According to the above-mentioned Yuan order, the county's actions were illegal and abrupt. Even if they lightly believed the words of the Mo City water police and suspected that the certificate was forged, Shanghai and Changshu are less than 200 li apart. How difficult would it be to verify the authenticity by telephone? This is not comparable to urgent military affairs or defenses. It could be delayed for a few days to investigate the truth. However, the county immediately relied on the one-sided words of the water police and convicted the crime of 'supplying food to the enemy,' confiscating all of the food rice. The handling of the incident was so hasty and biased that it cannot help but make people suspect the county's ulterior motives. Later, the Shanghai Social Bureau telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs on the 9th of last month, requesting that it be released. The Jiangsu Provincial Food and Fuel Regulation Office telegraphed the county government, ordering it to release it quickly. It has been nearly a month since then, and it has not been complied with. At the same time, the county sent another telegram to the affiliated association, claiming that the case had long been decided and that there was no possibility of returning it. It is even more believed that the county government, at the speed of lightning, confiscated the rice in order to make today's accomplishments indisputable. The step of disobeying the Yuan's order and the department's order is that, according to the government order, food rice that should absolutely not be confiscated, the county can use the phrase 'the case has long been decided' to protect the already completed situation. Is this any different from saying that a wrongful conviction has been established and does not need to be overturned? In a time of political clarity, how can this be allowed? Your Yuan should take charge, ordering the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate strictly. If the rice has indeed been confiscated and changed hands, the county should order the original owner to be paid back the rice price that has been changed. If they claim that it has already been used for other purposes, the county should also be ordered to compensate at the price, in order to exonerate those who have handled cases improperly. May Your Yuan approve." The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits.</p>
<h3>News of Sending Away Refugees</h3>
<p>Chaozhou Fellow Townsmen</p>
<p>The Chaozhou Association in Shanghai has sent away fellow townsmen for the third time, no less than several thousand people. The association has resumed contact with the British Swire Company, preparing for the fourth dispatch, and notified where to dispatch them. Assemble at the guild hall on Yangxing Street at 6:00 AM on the 13th to get tickets and board the ship. The ship is scheduled to depart at 8:00 AM this morning (13th).</p>
<p>Jiangning Six Counties</p>
<p>The Jiangning Six Counties Public Office on Xinzha Road in this city, the sixth batch of refugees sent away, has decided to postpone the departure for three days, that is, from the 12th to the 14th of this month, due to the continuous autumn rains and few people. After the deadline, they will no longer be sent away in order to end the operation.</p>
<p>Songjiang Fellow Townsmen</p>
<p>The Songjiang Association on Lafayette Road in this city previously cooperated with the Red Cross to provide free transportation by car for fellow townsmen returning to their hometowns. Now, as the transportation between Songjiang and Shanghai has gradually recovered, there is no need for this method in fact.

<h3>Songhu Garrison Headquarters Stipulates Procedures for Applying for Passports</h3>
<p>First Obtain the Application Form; Then Register and Wait for Approval</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters has issued a notice to ensure careful wartime transportation and standardize powers and responsibilities. All transportation passports within the Songhu jurisdiction should be issued by the Headquarters. In addition to the 200 blank passports that have already been issued to the Shanghai Transportation Committee, which can be filled out at any time, requests from other formal groups and merchants will be issued slowly due to incomplete procedures. The Headquarters has re-issued a notice the day before yesterday to clarify the procedures for groups and merchants to apply for transportation passports. The original text is as follows: "This Headquarters has been ordered by superior officers that all applications for transportation passports from groups or merchants within the jurisdiction of this Headquarters will be handled by this Headquarters after careful consideration. It has been announced in the newspaper before. During wartime, transportation is to ensure production and facilitate merchants and people. This township should give convenience according to the situation. However, in order to prevent traitors from taking advantage of this to help the enemy, and profiteers from making profits from it, so as not to harm the country and the people, this Headquarters must carefully review and issue the passports. In the past, most groups or merchants who applied for transportation passports did not provide detailed information on the starting and ending points, the number of transportation vehicles, the type and quantity of goods, and the dates of transportation to and from, which must be filled in on the passport. As a result, this Headquarters often had no way to approve the applications. Now, the procedures for groups or merchants to apply for transportation passports are hereby stipulated. They must first obtain the transportation passport application form in the format formulated by this Headquarters from the passport section of the rear office of this Headquarters, fill in the contents of the application form in detail, and then submit it to the aforementioned passport section for registration in accordance with the official procedures, and wait for it to be forwarded for approval. Hereafter, all groups and merchants who apply for transportation passports must follow these procedures."</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Education Status in Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>Education Department Orders and Promulgates Education Plan; All Levels of Schools Have Opened</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Since the launch of the War of Resistance against Japan, although Zhejiang Province is located in an important coastal area, education and youth undertakings have continued to progress. The Education Department has specially ordered and promulgated the "Points for Attention in Implementing Extraordinary Period Education in Primary and Secondary Schools" and the "Extraordinary Period Social Education Work Plan," distributing them to education authorities in various counties as the central goals. All primary schools in Hangzhou City opened as usual before the end of August, and the number of students attending was more than 80%. Universities and middle schools also started classes successively in early September and organized anti-enemy service groups to work hard for national salvation. To maintain educational safety, Zhejiang University has selectively moved to Tianmu Mountain in Qian, and Xiang Lake in Xiaoshan for classes. Zhijiang University and the Art College are still teaching at their original locations. A part of the Advanced Chinese School has moved to Jinhua to set up a branch school, and a part of Hangzhou Primary School has also moved to Tonglu. There are also several private middle schools that have moved to the interior. Most of the schools in Ningbo have moved inland, and the schools in Jiaxing are unwilling to move and maintain their original status. Tongji University, which was bombed in Shanghai, had its president, Weng Zhilong, come to Zhejiang to survey the school site in Jinhua. The entire school, including the three colleges of medicine, engineering, and science, and the two departments of the affiliated middle school and affiliated vocational school, moved from Shanghai to Hangzhou and then to Jinhua. German professors also came together. Classes are scheduled to begin around the 20th of this month. In addition, the Zhejiang Provincial Sports College, which was planned to be established this semester, has been decided by the provincial government to be discontinued.</p>

<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Wuxi</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Civilians Killed and Wounded; Local Losses of Tens of Millions</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The County Chamber of Commerce, Agricultural Association, Trade Union, Education Association, and other groups believe that Xiyi is not a war zone and has no military equipment. However, enemy planes suddenly flew to Wuxi on the afternoon of the 6th to bomb, dropping more than 30 bombs, causing the railway freight yard and shops, as well as the residential houses on the road area, Tongle Road, Chen Baitou Lane, and other places, and the Xinren warehouse to be burned down. A passenger car was bombed. According to statistics, more than a thousand civilians were killed and wounded. Corpses were scattered everywhere, and the number of people with broken arms and legs and bloody flesh was countless. There were so many wounded people in each hospital that they were overcrowded. It was really inhumane. As for the losses, they were nearly tens of millions. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the League of Nations and our country's chief representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, reporting and appealing, and asking them to uphold justice and implement effective sanctions as soon as possible. The original telegram stated: "Wuxi is not a war zone and has no military equipment. However, on the 6th of this month, Japanese planes suddenly came to bomb and dropped more than 30 bombs, and used machine guns to strafe. More than a thousand people were killed and wounded, especially factory workers, women, and children. There were broken heads and broken arms all over the ground. It was really unbearable to witness. The houses and factory machines that were destroyed caused losses of nearly tens of millions. The damage is being investigated in detail, and the right to claim compensation is reserved. Such an unreasonable and indiscriminate bombing is a disregard for justice and a violation of international conventions. We hereby telegraphed to request that it be submitted to the League of Nations for effective sanctions to maintain world justice." The Wuxi County Industrial, Commercial, and Educational Association of the Republic of China respectfully submits. Jia.</p>
<h3>Secret Sales of Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>Before the war, Japanese merchants in Shanghai had a large number of goods stored in customs warehouses in Pudong, Yangshupu, Hongkou, etc. (Imported foreign goods are usually stored in customs warehouses first, and then the tax is paid and the goods are picked up.) Now they are all rushing to the customs to pay taxes and pick up the goods. These stored goods are mostly seafood, sugar, rayon, cotton cloth, and various groceries, totaling about 20 to 30 million yuan. Several batches have now been taken out of the customs warehouse for trial sales. Japanese merchants are sparing no effort to lure the scum of the business community with huge commissions to peddle them everywhere. It is also heard that transport ships coming to Shanghai from Japan often secretly transport goods to Yangshupu recently, and then pay taxes and transport them at the customs set up by the enemy on Lan Road. However, because Chinese people are forbidden to go there, there is no definite evidence. The customs is intensifying its investigation of these smuggled goods.</p>
<h3>Children Waiting to Be Claimed</h3>
<p>Today, this newspaper received a letter from the Daxin Hotel on Fourth Malu, which stated, "On July 9th of this year, a traveler named Hu Shaolan, from Wuxian County, lodged in Room 251 of our hotel with a ten-year-old child (childhood name Xinglong). He stayed for more than 20 days. The surname Hu left early and returned late, claiming to be a teacher at a certain school in Zhabei. Because the child's mother died early, he took care of him with him. Every day when he went out, he left Xinglong in the hotel and entrusted the servants to take care of him. Since that month, Mr. Hu went out on the 30th and never returned. More than two months have passed, and there is no news of him. Only Xinglong is left. Our hotel will take care of him, but it has been a long time. If the child is wandering outside, it is very pitiful. If there are any relatives who know the whereabouts of Hu Shaolan, please come to the hotel to claim him, or if there are any relatives, please come to claim him. If it is due to traffic congestion, you can also notify our hotel by letter first. After the overall situation is settled and traffic is smooth, if you still do not come to claim him, we will send Xinglong to the Women and Children Relief Association to wait for him to be claimed."</p>
<h3>Our Country's Airplanes Triumphantly Celebrated</h3>
<p>— Xie Zhenqi</p>
<p>Fierce fire attacks drive iron eagles,</p>
<p>Amazing skills are rare in the world,</p>
<p>Straight up, the weight almost disappears,</p>
<p>Horizontally and vertically, seizing the enemy's soul and flying.</p>
<p>Wooden eagles resist the attack in those days,</p>
<p>Golden wings soar, the system is more sophisticated,</p>
<p>I have a heroic army of flying generals,</p>
<p>Instructing the enemy to sweep the empty group. (Gongshuban was good at attacking, Mozi was good at defending, and Bole passed through Ji and the horses were empty. This is from Changli Wen.)</p>
<h3>Song Police</h3>
<p>Jiushou once praised Mozi's excellence,</p>
<p>Nine attacks are useless, it is better to rest,</p>
<p>Stupid, revealing the tattooed custom,</p>
<p>Shrinking the country is a waste to expand the territory.</p>

<h3>Total War and the War of National Resistance (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Yu Mengyao</p>
<p>Therefore, in China today, the most important thing is to strengthen the people themselves, cultivate the strength of the entire nation to support the national power, and enable every person to sacrifice everything and resist to the end! Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has long said: "If war breaks out, there will be no distinction between north and south, no distinction between old and young. Everyone has the responsibility to defend the territory and resist aggression, and everyone should be prepared to sacrifice everything. Therefore, the government must be especially cautious in facing this major event, and the people of the whole country must be serious, calm, and prepared for self-defense." Now that war has broken out and the total war of resistance has been fully launched, our heroic soldiers have also fully demonstrated their great power! However, this strength is still not enough. We must know that this war of resistance is a war for the survival of our entire Chinese nation, a war in which our 450 million descendants of the Yellow Emperor are striving for strength. Naturally, we should use the entire national strength to resist the enemy's aggression! Thoroughly unleash the national strength and demonstrate the inherent spirit of our nation!</p>
<p>For the past fifty years, we have directly suffered enough of the Japanese imperialists' aggression and oppression. Our land has been forcibly occupied by the enemy for countless tens of millions of miles, and countless of our compatriots have been brutally killed by the enemy! The pain and great trauma are truly as deep as the sea! We have endured for such a long time, and it has been enough. Now is the time for us to settle accounts with the enemy! We should do it heartily. Compatriots across the country, with one heart and one mind, rise up with the strength of the entire nation, for our nation, for our country, working together in unison, marching in step, attacking the enemy, and fighting a desperate battle with the enemy!</p>
<p>Now that we have recognized the meaning of the war of resistance, we should know the tasks of the people during the war. The emergence of various people's organizations, such as support associations, national salvation associations, wartime service corps, and battlefield rescue teams, is a good manifestation of the people's strength. Therefore, to strengthen the power of the government, we should mobilize the people of the whole country, organize a united front of soldiers and civilians to resist the enemy together, and under the guidance of our nation's highest leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, unleash the great power of the people, to fulfill the divine duty of "every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation!"</p>
<p>We can believe that the power of the people is the greatest. During the American Revolutionary War, the people's armed forces organized by the United States inflicted a great blow on the British army. Also, the Spanish people's armed defense of Madrid a month ago shows that the ferocious rebel army could do nothing to them, which shows a glimpse of the people's armed force. Furthermore, the Xinhai Revolution also succeeded by relying on the strength of the people. This time, it is a struggle for the survival of our entire nation, and its significance and mission are ten thousand times more important than the Xinhai Revolution. We must devote all our efforts to it in order to achieve the final victory! Therefore, our people should immediately mobilize to jointly overcome national difficulties and become a national warrior in the total war of resistance.</p>
<p>Now is the time for the war of national resistance. Our people should rise up together. The tasks of the war of national resistance can be divided into several major categories, such as organizing self-defense forces, transporting and storing grain, preventing reactionaries, providing comfort and rescue, and enforcing economic sanctions, all of which are urgent priorities at the moment. If our people work hard together, naturally, the final victory must be ours!</p>
