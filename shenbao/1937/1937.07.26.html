<h3>駐華北的四個日本武官</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>日本的對華政策，歷來側重於“分化內部”與“武力恫嚇”兩種方式。這兩種方式試行以來，很收成效，尤其是第一種方式為最靈騐，因為這種殺人不見血的手段，旣可以减輕列國的視聽，又不費一兵一卒的力，可以垂手而得的，分化的法門，就是派所謂“武官”“特務機關長”等分子，利用漢奸的弱點着手，茲將現駐華北的四個武官略歷，分說如下：</p>
<p>㊀香月淸同，年五十七歲，佐賀縣人，為陸軍中的佐賀派中堅分子，性倔强剛愎，士官學校第十四期出身，比杉山陸相後二年　業，初不過一少尉級的班長，日俄戰爭後昇為中尉，後派到駐德日大使館充武官，未幾又昇為陸軍省副官，敎育總監部課長，陸軍省兵務課長，遂列於少壯强硬派的伍中，祈謂陸軍中的正統派，再昇任第三十旅旅長，四年前，進級中蔣，轉任步兵學校校長，未幾又昇為第十二師長，二•一六事變後，竟擢為近衛師師長，林銑十郁組閣，中村孝太郎任陸相時，忽躍而任敎育總監部本部長，田代病重之時，陸軍部內，物色繼任人選甚難，杉山陸相迴想到民國十七年濟南事變時，香月任陸軍省兵務課長，他想出一個計策，把駐滿州的外山一旅大軍，急遽的調到山東，可是陸軍省內，因外山旅中的松本市一團，不肯出動，香月不過大佐（上校）竟在省內與反對論者大起論爭，香月力說“得功機會不可坐失”，極力慫恿該團乘機派魯，因此松本團的兵士，大為所動，結果香月的主張，遂被貫澈，於是他的大名，蒸蒸日上了。為什麼呢？北伐軍到了濟南，被日軍橫加阻截，從此開了用武力壓迫對華的先例，而他們軍部的頭腦，也是從這次後，更加肆意妄為了。等到事變吿終，論功行賞，松本一團，有五人獲金鵄勳章，認為日俄大戰後最榮耀的功勳，其中二人，就是攻擊濟南城西北角最力的，而香月亦因主張得勝，為軍部所推崇，他就趾高氣揚，得意非凡，自是以後，官運大大的亨通，昇為第三十旅旅旻，由旅長而師長，這次蘆溝事變勃發，杉山陸相迴想到濟南事變中央軍被阻的主張，與陸軍首腦部，磋商結果，認為最適合時宜的人，乃决定由他繼任，他奉到命令後，急遽從立川飛行塲搭機飛到天津，走馬上任，他一到了天津，竟以我國民為對𧰼就出了一張所謂“日本軍安民的布吿”，後來又發表對華强硬的談話，襲濟南事變時的故技，電調大軍來華，壓迫冀察當局城下之盟，照這樣看起來，雖然我國什麼樣的隱忍，渴望和平，不使事態擴大，在事實上恐怕不能容許了。為什麼呢？他在國內尚且主張武力對華，今旣來華，還沒有得到侵略的功勳，豈肯就此罷手嗎？㊁橋本羣，年五十二歲，廣島人，為陸軍部內對華急進派的中間分子，他係士官學校二十期騎兵科出身，外柔內剛，與土肥原相伯仲，曾任駐法日使館武官，其後轉任參謀本部部員，野戰砲兵學校敎官，野戰砲兵第一團團長，參謀本部課長，軍務局軍事課長，因發生了永田事件，引咎辭職，不料因禍得福，反昇為鎭海要塞司令官，去年才進极少將為法西司帝派大日本靑年黨領袖，調充華北駐屯軍參謀長，於是他以為機會到了，發揮侵華為工具的把戲，在平津大肆活動，聽說他乘蘆溝橋事變，聯絡天津漢奸團體“大亞西亞協會”，“普安協會”等，想發動自治運動，反對冀察政務委員抗敵分子及二十九軍，他的意圖，先使平津特殊化，再進而蠶食其他隣接各省，他與田代意見不合，嫌田代手段太軟弱，認田代的才幹，不能應付華北的環境，現在時代已死，來了香月，當然合他的胃口，所以華北未來的局面，若非形成第三個偽組織，他們恐怕决不甘休，况且他的徼倖心，比土肥原有過之無不及。㊂松井太九郎，大佐（上校）五十一歲，福岡縣人，士官學校二十二期生，曾在海參威及西伯利亞各地秘密活動，因被俄軍偵悉，犯了重大的間牒罪，逮捕下獄，俄軍本欲處以極刑，經日外交交涉，監禁三個月，驅逐出國，他在監牢裏，向俄犯學習了俄語，歸國後，選充參謀本部部員，陸軍省新聞班員，關東軍參謀，大阪聯隊區司令官，滿州駐軍隊長，很為關東軍所賞識，於本年三月，充任北平特務機關長，冀察政務委員會為便利與日軍交涉起見，亦聘他為顧問，於是他就如魚得水，負了特殊的使命，開始分化華北內部，吸收親日分子，挑撥中央與華北關係等拿手好戲，時常奔走于天津通州北平間，想實現理想的“華北特殊化，”擴大冀東偽組織了。今井武夫，少佐（少校）年四十歲，長野縣人，士官學校第三十期出身，畢業後即入參謀本部中國課服務，專門研究中國事情，選任我國各地武官，之其對于兩廣方面情形，更為熟悉，足跡幾遍兩粵，曾任奉天特務機關長，現充北平日大使館武官輔佐官，此人性甚狡猾，對華播弄，無孔不入，通華語，自認為“中國通，”每次與冀察當局折衝時巧言令色，很得一部親日分子的信賴。統觀上述的四人，都以對華為昇官進級的唯一工具，一意孤行，尚未認淸中國國內的統一與民族心理的堅强，慣施其分化手段，那末中日兩國的關係，恐怕像德法國交，怨仇愈結愈深了。筆者回想到去年東京讀賣新聞評論委員室伏高信來華時，他對本埠日記者發表談話，說“中日糾紛的不斷，都是一批武官們從中搗亂的緣故，要想中日眞正的親善，急把所有的武官們撤回日本……”這句話真是他對華認識淸楚的正論啊。</p>

<h3>國防綫上（十七）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>每一“村團”的“組”數，以村中戶數十公之一為比例，不得多組。（甲）所謂“村團長”的人選，必須合乎三個特定條件。㊀“有主張公道的熱心，㊁“能提動全村三十八歲以下的人，”㊂“最好粗通文學。”（乙）所謂村“副團長”的人選標準，也有三個：㊀“有主張公道的熱心，”㊁“能帮助村團長，”㊂“最好粗通文學。”（而“附村”之“副團長，”並須能“提動該“附村三十八歲以下的人。”）（內）所謂“幹事”的人選條件，也有兩個，㊀有熱心”，㊁“能帮助。”（而“附村”之“幹事”並須具備：㊀有主張公道的熱心”，㊁能提動該“附村”三十八歲以下的人”。（丁）所謂“組長”的人選標準是：㊀“能受祖長調練，㊁“能領導一小組主張公道”。（戊）所謂“指導員”的人選標準是：㊀對“本團主張認識清楚”•㊁“並能熱心贊助”（己）所謂“組員”的資格是：㊀“在村者”，㊂“十八歲以上三十八歲以下”，㊂無下列情形之一者：（A）“有貪賊舞弊行為”，B）“吸食丹料鴉片（C“忤逆不孝”）”曾受刑事處分”，（D）“E”游手好閑不務正常職業”。</p>
<p>按照上面的組織系統，和條件，現在，山西全省，有“縣團部”一百零五，“區團部”一千四百二十四個，“村團郃”一萬一千一百五十一個，“小組”十九萬零二百八十一們，“團員”一百萬零九千零九十四人。</p>
<p>第二“主張公道團”的使命和任務——這樣一種龐大的，政治性的民眾組織，牠的使命，到底是什麼呢？我曾經問過許多山西人士，他們的答覆是：“團結好人，主張公道。”這是答得太籠統了。要是再詳細一點，那就是：“團結好人，制裁壞人，消除社會不平，建立社會公道，消滅共禍，自強救國。”尤其後面這兩點，我覺得是大可以用來劃分牠成立以來的兩個時期的：“消滅共禍”是牠第一期的主要使命；“自強救國”是牠第二期的使命。所以，在牠二十五和一十六度的工作裹，均特別定出了“協助檢舉漢奸”一項祇要“團員”向“村團部”報合，經縣政府查實後，並可得賞洋一百元。那“主張公道歌”的第五首道：“主張公道，第一要犧牲，犧牲纔能成大仁，有人做漢奸，勾結敵國人，處死處死，不稍留情。這些，就是牠注重“自強救國”這一點的明證。</p>
<p>牠的具體任務，大槪有這幾項：㊀“舉發官吏違法失職，㊁“舉發劣紳土棍佔便宜，不說理，不公道的行為，㊂防止共產黨赤化村荘”，㊃勸導無業游民，及不務正業之壞入，改邪歸正，”㊄“贊助村中行政上一切與利除弊事項”。</p>
<p>我們似乎可以這樣說：牠是政治性非常濃厚的民眾組織。牠的任務是“組織民眾訓練民眾”，以集體的力量，去澄清政治黑暗，剷除社會不平；牠的使命是：對內防止赤化，對外抵抗國家的仇敵。而其根底裹，還是在維護他們所謂的“公道”。</p>
<p>第三，牠的工作“主張公道團”這兩二年內的工作，成績最火的，據山西當局們說，是以檢舉部份為最：從二十五年五月到九月，四個月裹，共檢舉過五千六百零七件案于。被檢舉的人，除各高級官吏外，共餘如縣長，承審員，管獄員，公安局長，巡官，區長，和防共保衛團長，等等，無不盡有。有申斥，有記過，有撤職，甚至有槍斃的。然而，這些不過是澄淸吏治的消極工作，如果出民眾運動的立場上去看，我以為，那成續卻以“組織”方面為最大的。試想，以山西那種古氣盎然的社會，在短短的兩年之內，就可以組織了一百萬零九千零九十四人。這真是一件不容易的工作！其次有成績的工作，我想要算是“宣傳”了。記者在山西的時候，看到滿街的“主張公道團”製定的標語和春聯，戲院，電影院等公共場所，常有宣傳員在那兒宣講“主張公道”。他們非常起勁地，用山西口音重復着：“主簪(張)官(公)道，主簪(張)官(公)道。”有一回，我買了一包糖果，一拆閒纸袋，嚇，有張纸籤飛出來了，那上面印着字句道：“制裁壞官坏紳坏人，”“扶助好官好紳好人，”還有四個字橫額：“主張公道”這宣傳，真可謂“無孔不入！”</p>
<p>牠的工作，二十五年度的，共分“日常”與“協助”兩部。日常的工作有六種：㊀組織，㊁訓練，㊂互助，㊃互評，㊄檢舉，㊅宣傳。協助其他機關做的工作有四種：㊀協助檢舉漢奸，㊁協助倡用土貨，㊂協助禁烟禁毒，㊃協助訓練少年及婦女，(𠥻五年度暫缺。)試辦工作一項：“團員送取交件。”二十六年度的州作，可以分成十項：㊀選拔，㊁訓練，㊂互助，㊃互評，㊄檢舉，㊅宣傳，㊆協助檢舉漢奸，㊇協助倡用土貨，㊈協助禁烟禁毒，㊉協助訓練民眾。外加“團員送取文件”一項。和二十五年度比起來，不同之處，共有兩點：㊀二十五年度的第一項工作“組識”，在二十六年度已經取消，變成了選拔”。因為在組織方面，旣已擴充到一百多萬人，差不多已經是山四全省十八到三十八歲之開的壯丁們全體了，組織工作無須再做；當前的工作，自然是選拔幹員。並且，在這一年度裹，“小組長”也改專由“組員”推選，而不由村團長核定了。㊁協助訓練民眾工作，已經正式開始。遵照國府規定的。辦法，分成A壯丁訓練，B少年訓練，C婦女訓練，等三項。其中婦女訓練一項，由各村“民訓委員會”舉辦，而“主張公道團”協助之。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>為和平盡了最大的努力</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>這幾天來。我國軍政常局已為東亞和平。盡了最大的努力了。然而侵略者的軍隊還是源源進關。節直打算把我河北的領士永入佔據下去。據昨日北平電訊。宛平城以東日軍非但不撤。反據沙崗村高地作砲兵陣地。強拉就地我國農民。掘交通長壕。直逹豐台。這種行動證明着日本對於前幾天所謂撤兵談判。毫無誠意。而我方片面履行撤兵。简直是又上了一次圈套。雖然如此。我們相信前綫英勇的守士將士决不會因此气餒。等到侵略者再度挑戰的時候。他們在全國民衆支持之下。一定還能給侵略者致命的打擊的。</p>
<p>那時候擴大的全面戰爭。想像起來。該更慘烈罷。然而日本方面所表現的態度旣然如此。我們卻也不妄想避免這種慘禍了。從儿一八事變以來。我中央及地方軍政當局歷次的言論及舉動都向全世界昭示着。中国是酷爱和平。決不求戰的。就是蘆講橋事变發生以後。我國當局維護和平的苦心也與天下以共見。可是侵略者不顧世界的公論。一意要用破壞和平的手段。來宰制我們这一個有以千年歷史的偉大民族我們怎能再忍受下去委曲求全呢。以此日前蔣委員長爲盧構橋事變提示了我國具的立塲四點。全國四萬五干萬軍民就非常的感奮着。大家在蔣委員長領導之下。為耍保衛我國的領士和主權。現在是準備作最後的犧牲了。</p>
<p>我們相信這一種民族的決心。有着莫大的意義。因爲歷史的事實昭示着。民放的復興多半是經過了血的洗禮的。在這遠東火藥庫已經着火的時刻。顯然只有日本帝國主義者收回它所投卞的火種。才能使世界人類避免大爆發的禍變罷。可是我們覺得這種希望是渺茫得很了。</p>

<h3>從上海工業展覽商說到今後工業之動向</h3>
<p>— 潘文安</p>
<p>這次上海市政府十周紀念中，於國民經濟建設上最有貢獻的，要推工業展覽會，計分機械工業展覽，手工藝品展覽，工業安全展覽三部，分設三處會場。吾大終觀雙以後，得到不少的感想，認為我國今後工業的動向，比較已往情形，確有改變之必要。</p>
<p>吾們覺得這次機械工業展覽會的陳列，確能打破以前習憤，足為工業展覽史開一新紀元。應徵品分實物，換型，製造程序，工作表演四種。而工作表演，處處示觀者以製造的程序，與工作的手續，尤足以引起國人對於新興工業之興趣。如大隆鐵工廠，中華鐵工廠，鑄亞鐵工廠，公勤鐵廠等，均將所造機器出品，以活動方式，當場試𦁤，數量不求多，而品質極精粹，在在足以表揚我國民族工業年來進展的程度。手工藝品展覽部分，蒐羅甚富，雖不限於上海，而以上海出品為特多。有人謂在機械化壓迫下的手工業，還有這些成績，似乎很不容易，可是我們以嚴格眼光來觀察，這許多手工藝品，可以明瞭大半的手工藝，已漸漸的採用簡單機械，已從手工的，進而為半機械了。工業安全展覽會陳列的物品，計分照片，掛圖，統計，圖表，模型，儀器，寶物，法令，書籍八類，每類徵品，以關於工廠安全衛生的設施指導，工廠災害的統計，發生災害的實物，工廠安全險查的儀器等等，凡有關於工業安全的事物，都在緹致之中。從這次工業展覽會以後，吾們認為今後辦工業的人，至少要注意下面的五件事，以作設施工業上今後的動向。</p>
<p>第一今後工業的進展，一定要確定整個的計書。吾們覺得民族工業的優勝，在能大量生產，在能標準化，而後應付裕如，不受淘汰。這次會中出品，除了家著名工廠之外，最大缺點，在式樣不一，在生產量不多，不能如期交貨。尤其廷手工業的情形，格外顯著。希望經此展覽以後，任何工廠，在開辦時，一定先須有統盤的籌書。在每年之始，並須根據上年的營業趨勢，來定今年進行的方針，自然可以共求相應，不致動感掣肘。各工廠的工作機械，千萬要注意精密正確，寗使價格貴些，不可貪圖便宣，影響到產品的標準。</p>
<p>第二今後工業的進展，不論機製品手工品，首須研究各地顧客的嗜尚與心理，這次各省來參觀工業展覽的會，有一個共同缺點，便是沒有研究到各地流行的舶來品，有沒有替代的國貨？同時上海工業家，到各地參觀考察時，也沒有注意到這個問題。聞仁豊染織廠朱賡陶君，這回赴華北考察棉布市場，發現有兩種花色布，極流行於中等人家，朱君回滬窮一月之工夫，而此兩種布疋成功，業已暢銷，於魯冀各省。吾們希望此後展覽會中各廠出品，最好標出各種布疋的銷路，某種銷某省，某種銷某地，比較上更有意義，更足以促起各省參觀人的注意。</p>
<p>第三今後工業，應注意於民生日用，與足以替代外貨上着想。在機械工业手工艺品兩會中所陣列的國货，尚没有完全注意到這种地方，如大隆之紡织机器，華成之馬遠，可以說完全來替代外貨的；同時有許多裝飾品，玩賞品，雖不少有國藝的價值，可是欣賞者多，而問津者少，且大部分還覺沒有到盡善盡美的境界。所以有人尚說過這次出品還嫌博而不精的話，希望出品人急急注意才是。</p>
<p>第四今後工業，應注意於國防工業與重工業，會中陳列重工業出品，特別缺少，如新和興鋼鐵廠的竹節鋼條，永利廠的各種酸𫒵出品，還不及盡量羅致。在這國難危重到萬分地步，我們憑什麽國防工業，來維護國土？憑什麼重丁業，來中衛合給？我們想到這點，都覺得不寒而慄起來。希望工業家以後與其在同業間作不必耍與無謂之競爭，使出品過量或矛盾，不如異軍特起，在重工業國防工業上多下工夫</p>
<p>第五今緩工業的動向，以利川固有原料為第一要着。如四川省之玉草，為革帽原料，華北之羊毛，為呢帽坯，江北及太倉嘉定一帶之蒲草，茜草，黃草，均為任何編織物之極好原料，倘加以二種以上之顏色，不僅為國人所喜用，即外人亦極歡迎。以中國為原料國家，到處廣產原料，即到處可以辦工業。倘利用得宜，人工運輸，在在省便，而定價可以低廉，地方富源，惟此是賴。惜工展會中之出品，能利川當地原料而能創作新物別開生面者無多，可見天然富源，尚未盡利用。</p>
<p>凡茲听述，於此十日間周覽各種工展會中，就參觀者的意見，與吾人之蠡測，略貢芻堯，以供當局的切磋。至於工業安全展覽，為嶄新事業，吾們十年前尚為參想不到，尤願從事工業者特別重視其有造於今後工業的進展，更不在小。</p>
<h3>現階段的米麥統制問題</h3>
<p>— 李寅北</p>
<p>米麥統制，本係統制經濟體系中的支流。若據統制經濟的理論上言欲實行米麥統制，須先有統制米麥的途徑；沒有統制途徑而冒冒失失地來執行米麥統制，這是在事理上所不可能的。今日我國統制米麥的事實，已日漸明朗化。而於統制米麥途徑上的決擇，誠然是一件不容忽略的工作。本文的領域，就在討論今日統制米麥的途徑問題。按統制米麥的途徑，要不外乎三種如下；㊀米麥的消費統制，㊁米麥的生產統制，㊂米麥的運銷統制。現在筆者將這三個途徑，來分別介紹如何。</p>
<p>㊀米麥的消費統制</p>
<p>按米麥消費，與一般普通消費品的消費情形不同。從普通消費品的消費情形來說，為了人民貧富購買力的懸殊，大都就不能拿人民的“慾望”來決定人民的消費量。然而從米麥的消費情形來觀察，各人的消費量，就不能拿貧富來決定了。所以在米麥消費的性質上論：米麥是種具有“社會性”的消費物。有“社會性”的消費物，就不應該由私人來經營，用作盈利的事業。因此，統制米麥消贊的目的，就在於不以盈利而在於給養人民。所以它的統制手段，是不外乎下列兩種；㊀山政府直接來管理全國米麥的分配；㊁由政府間接來監督人民的米麥消費合作社。前一種的統制手段，可稱為米麥絕對的統制；像過去社會主義的蘇聯政府所施行的計口分配制。RationSystem就是屬於此類。後一種是米麥相對的統制。完全基於人民公平互肋的原則，組織米麥消費合作社。採取官督民營的制度，來控制全國米麥的消費。現在我國統制米麥消費的手段，突竟宜乎採用第一種方式呢，還是採用第二種方式？按我國是三民主義的國家，與祉會主養的蘇俄，在主羲立場上，是不能行這種直接管理米麥分配的政策。其次，更就中，蘇兩國的國情論：我國日向以家族經濟制度為中心的社會，其蘇俄的社會經濟情形，亦不能接近，由此兩層觀點來透視，統制米麥消費的手段，祇有組織國民米麥消費合作社，為容易接近。不過從實行消費合作來說：下列的五個問題，不能不予以深切的注意‧㊀在民間開接食用的米盒，如釀酒，製糖，飼喂畜類等，這當然非消費合作社所能過問的事，中央在統制消費合作前，則對於釀酒，製糖的如何限制，飼喂畜類的代用品如何設法。這許多問題，在事前就應該統盤籌謀的。㊁我國民智低劣，合作觀念不深。往往消費合作社為吸引顧客之計，乃規定社員與非社員一律分紅，像這樣下去，非社員的人數勢必激增；而合作社的主持人，因為格於須由社員擔任的緣故，因此，非社員雖然人數日增，但沒有過問社務的機會。而合作社的事務，就未免有被少數人操縱之虞！㊂在此米麥尚未實行半均販賣前，其售價的決定，常然不能由合作社來控制。而在經售米麥的商人，為要同合作社競爭營業起見，就難免不狂跌成本，以求多賣。這種情形，當然合作社是不利的。㊃按消費合作公釣：一切賣買，大致概行現售制。對於一般平日習尚的賒賣顧客，自不能接受。但目前的一股米麥商人，放帳營業，已成慣例。消費合作社在這種局勢下，應該進謀切實的辦法，用以補救。㊄在懂了合作社經營方法的人，未必能熟悉米麥情形，而在懂了米麥情形的，卻未必能明白合作社的經營方法。要求得一個面面俱到的人才，當然是不容易的事情，而在全國米麥統制總動員時，這統制消費的人的問題，實卻不容忽視。</p>
<p>㊁米麥的生產統制</p>
<p>米麥生產統制的目的；統言之，不外做到米麥的產消適合。然而現在來嚴格言之，除在平時，須做到（甲）中國人吃自國米麥；（乙）三年耕必餘一年之食外。而在戰時，且須管理全國民間的米麥工業；如脫粒，礱穀，碾製，磨粉等類。實施所謂糧食國防的陣線。因此，中國要踏上這條統制米麥生產的途徑，下列幾個先決問題，就不能不先注意。㊀所謂中國人吃自國來麥，換言之：實就是不吃洋米與洋麥。要達此目的，首當注意米麥增產。按增產米麥的唯一條件，須擴展耕地面積。今據美人貝克氏Beker估計，中國全部土地可耕奢，約佔全國土地面積百分之二十九；不適於耕種的土地，約佔百分之七十強。而現在已經墾植的土地，不過一萬八千英畝。在事理上說：似乎儘可從事於墾植。但是邊疆之地，天時地利不宜於耕植。所以在短時期內，耕地而積的增加，是無甚希望的。然而原來的肥沃田地，因為被民間墓塋的侵佔，耕地日見縮小；近年來．更因為交通公路的建設，佔用民間有用的土地，更其不勝計數。欲云增產，誠不可能！㊁耕地面積無法擴展，必退而從事於農業技術上的改進；如推廣良種，實行治蟲，改良灌溉，增進地力等類。按此種農事技術的改進，於集體農場始見效。我國農用土地，向製諸子分承法；所以耕地的散碎，為任何國家所僅見。以此散碎的土地，來施行這種新式的農業技術，縱有成效，其成效當極微—㊂統制全國米麥工業，須先修改不平等條約。否則國米國麥已受制於政府：而帝國主義在華的糧食工業，仍然不肯就範。如在華北方面的麥粉市場，幾盡為某國商人所操縱。在這種情形來觀察，統制國糧工業而不統制外人的糧食工業，不當為帝國主義者造成擾亂市場的機會。</p>
<p>㊂米麥的運銷統制</p>
<p>有人曾計算過，同量的糧食在中國幾百里路的運輸費用，反比美國的食料橫渡太平洋後到中國銷售的價，還要昂貴。無怪乎中國同一省內，同時甲地有米麥過剩，而乙地則發生米麥恐慌。因此，米麥運銷統制的職責；就在調節全國米麥的盈虧。但按耍調劑盈虧，須從全國米麥的購買，儲積，運送與分配四個機構上一貫運用，才能做到。現在這幾個運銷機構，還有好多問題蘊藏着。不信，請試舉述如下：㊀購買米麥的先決問闖，在於米麥價格的控制。因為非如此，則不能集中米麥。但按諸國內的國際的經濟情形：中國米麥價格，不單與國內產地價格，形影相隨；即與國外米麥產地價格，亦有亦步亦趨之勢。所以現在我國米麥價格的決定，有時固受國內產地米麥價格的影響；有時尚受國外產地價格的支配。所以統制運銷，縱能控制國內米麥的價格，而於國外產地價格的外襲，尚成一相當問題。㊁運送米麥的先決問題，首在國內交通經濟的健全‧我國近年來的交通建設，大抵係側重於公路。按公路祇能供軍運與客運的利用，對於貨運業務，因經濟條件的不合，未能開辦。社麥係笨重貨物的一種，顯然不合於公路的運輸條件。因此，公路建設縱使日飛猛進，而於運送米麥上，尚無絲亳裨益。至於就鐵路而言：鐵道雖可運送社麥，但苦於鐵路里程過短與其他種種問題。封於運送米麥，尚米能勝任。最近如粵漢路巳通車，在理論上的湘米入粵，當可不成問題。然而事實所示，粵省米荒之急，湘米仍然姍姍來遲！以此例彼，可知米麥運送問題的關鍵，當還須求交通網的健全。㊂我國米麥集散方法，向以一個集散中心而分配給各地客幫。例如上海為全國米麥的集散中心，其分配米麥，向先由南洋，北洋，長江三大客帮採辦。然後由各地客帮而米麥行，而米麥零售商店，以至米麥消費民衆。統制米麥分配的組織，各地須有米麥購買合作社，來替代商業組織上的客帮。假如非如此而用過渡或用通融的辦法，那末在米麥平均分配在於給餋国民的原則下，怎樣來监督這以盈利為主的米麥中間人。</p>
<p>我們從上述三个统制途徑的問題來觀察，現階段這三個統制途徑，實已相互環連着。耍實行米麥统制，應該從消費生產運銷方面打成一片。不容有一個可以聽後的。現在除統制運銷方面，財政部雖有全國糧食運銷局的設立，至於統制消費與生產，政府近年來也有過計劃。前者如預備設立的全國糧食管理局，後者如前次農村復興委員會所擬的“中國米麥自給計劃。”可稱為對於全國整個的米麥統制問題，都有了相當的籌謀。不過問題的發生，都出於實地實幹後才會知道；因此，筆者就在可能範圍的忖度，為成此文。俾作統制米麥前的參考。至於今後實行整個的米麥統制後，在實地實幹所觸到的問題，那是我們在此刻尚無從想像哩。</p>
<h3>世界儲麥與中國應取之措置</h3>
<p>— 警石</p>
<p>糧食與軍備均為戰時勝敗之關鍵，故各國準備戰事之發生，莫不預先探討糧食統制或糧食管理之辦法，以求屆時供需相應，庶可增加或延長國家戰鬥力量。如美國之糧食管理FoodAdministration英之糧食統制FoodControl及法俄之糧食供給統制FoodSnpplyControl皆為戰時應用之方法，與平時一般農業政策不同，而世界各種經濟衛國主義尤注意於小麥一項。蓋各國素以食麥為主，即平素米麥互用者，亦以小麥便於携帶製成乾糧後，最適合於軍事需要，故小麥不啻為近世非常局面中糧食問題之中心。</p>
<p>就近一二年間，世界各國着意於冉軍擴後，顧慮日後戰時之糧食問題，而見諸施行者，如美國在去年成立一糧食議會，並將實行其國防計劃之一部，擬大量增加小麥之積儲，即以加拿大所能供給，約五千萬英斗，整個移作此項用途，又有由五千萬英斗增加至六千七百萬至七千六百萬英斗之議。意大利亦積極吸收國外小麥之輸入於本年一月三十日，更實行將小麥進口稅由原定每百公斤抽三二里拉之稅率，臧至十八里拉，麥粉由四九里拉減至二七。五里拉，阿根廷則以小麥需要增加於去年十二月將最低價之規定取銷，即無異於出口補肋之取銷。立宛陶深恐小麥輸出影響民食及國防，曾於去冬下令禁止麥類出口。</p>
<p>如上所舉，各國之種種措旋，其目標均為吸收小麥之存儲，以備戰時之用而已。但就各方估計去年世界小麥消費各國所須之輸入量為五二八百萬英斗較以前估計為少，而實際可以供給輸出者僅四七五百萬英斗，尚不及估計數字。目其中有三○百萬斗為美國所除入，此為前次所木有，（因美為產麥之國，因此各需要國人口商所經手之輸入額，常不及一九二八——九年度九○○百萬英斗之半數也。</p>
<p>同時去年世界小麥產量已減至九年來之最低水準㊀去年美，澳，加拿大三大產區維三年歉收之後，復遇大旱，產量更不如前，故美國且繼續前二年為小麥之輸入國，在一九三四百萬英斗矣，㊁意大利存麥減少，新麥狀況亦惡，更急於囤儲，㊂阿根廷雖稍有增加，為可以輸出之數仍少，㊃在澳洲則有各國向其爭購存麥；㊄蘇聯農業技術進步云云未必可靠，目因清償短期債務及黃金產量增加，不必大量如－九三○—一年之大量傾銷</p>
<p>因上項情形，故芝加哥小麥，去年十二月曾漲至一‧四三萬元。迄今上升不巳。按諸歉收而論，此種糧價之上升不過為暫時現象，如各國囤儲以備戰為目標，則趨勢殊不易下降也。</p>
<p>我國食糧以為米麥並重，互為調劑。惟在此國際風雲日緊之秋，稪有東隣覬覦在旁，自亦不應不早事籌劃自給自足之計。究諸實際我國麥產向稱不足，每年均有大量粉麥輸入。最近五年間，最多時民二十二年小麥輸入達一○，七一四，六三四公担，去年始降至一，一六八，○九三公担。麵粉進口二十二年為一，九五七，一一三公担，去年亦減至三一○，○一八公担。此種減退之理由一方為我國麥產略形增加之故，去年收穫計為四六一百萬市担，較前年增加百分之七‧七。另一方面以上述各種情形，足使美澳等麥無法向我國輸入，同時且受其影響，而形成粉麥價格高漲之現象，其影響於民食前途至深且鉅。</p>
<p>推共原因㊀去年世界麥價普遍騰漲，國內需要雖感不足，而消費者終不願以高昂之代價輸入外麥：㊁日本去年小麥收穫量，較往年少百分之六，同時對澳洲羊毛貿易政策施以報復，故轉向我國採購大量粉麥。試就海關冊所載，去年小麥出口竟有三一六，八○八公担，幾與二十年輸出之四十餘萬公担相近，本年五個月亦達四九，三五六公担。麵粉輸出去年為九二，一七二公担，亦超過前數年，其中大部係日方採購。因此國內愈感不足，故粉麥價格日见昂貴，造成民食嚴重之局，本年更以國內各省水旱為災，收成減少。世界各國之囤儲政策並未變更，且有日益加萬之槪。而日本之收購較前益甚，故最近雖屬新麥登場之際，而各地產價銳升不已。日人在各地採購之訊各報屢有記戰，尤以蕪湖一隅為甚，故當地麥價最高時，每包曾達九‧三元，創歷年之新紀錄，較諸食米反昂三四角。此種現象確為近年所僅見。值此新麥上市時更屬不合理殊甚，試以五年來同時期之價格列表如後，反常狀熊昭然若揭矣。</p>
<p>就表中數字所示，本年六月與前年同月相較，美麥計增高百分之九二，漢口及津浦路麥漲起百分之五○左右，麵粉漲百分之六○以上。按理在新麥登場之時，其價格必形下落，乃近兩年來，忽行反常而上升，此無怪乎去年下年繼續上漲，至十二月份較前年六七月之價格額出一倍之鉅。本年亦復如是，更以歉收及日本趁機收購，故粉麥價漲益漫無止境。吾人處此情勢之下，在平時已足以造成民食恐慌之局，況且前蘆案爆發，若和平之途徑無從開展，則擴大為兩國之戰爭固在意中之事。我國平素既少周密之糧食統制辦法，則一旦陷於非常局面之中，全國軍糧與後方民食之急待籌措，其迫切自更較任何，國為要着。</p>
<p>最近小麥出口，已由財部禁止，由滬運津之麥粉三于萬餘包，亦山海關予以扣留，此舉吾人認為確為當前必耍之處置，固不待訪。近日更由本市糧食團體商定，此後國內轉口食糧，凡運作軍用者須由當地軍事機關證明，民用則由商會證明。然我國地方各通商口岸，多有日木軍民屯駐，茍為高利所趨當地奸民難免不無私相轉售之慮，頃者更聞有禁運紛米麥至大連旅順秦皇鳥等地之決定，此外更望自即日起始，全國食糧統制動員亟應迅速擴大進行！</p>
<p>糧食統制之要點不外，㊀調查供求情形，㊁設置食庫以備儲藏；㊂官營運銷，㊃提倡節約；㊄改造現有市場機構等數點。惟就況時狀態而論，事已急如星大，應先就一三兩點着手，關於調查供求情形，可責成各省市縣當地軍政機關會同商會及糧食公會迅行調查並登記當地存儲及運銷情形，以便軍用及後方之分配。一方為便利戰時運輸計，可由財實交通等部合營運銷，俾時間及運輸之迅速。其他數點須視時間之充分與否而定取捨，更非會猝可成。吾人甚望在此戰機尚未擴大之時，以及新糧甫在絡續登場之際，舉國上下早日促成之則不啻增加國防之勁城也。</p>

<h3>“我做甚麽”</h3>
<p>— 閣重樓</p>
<p>‘敵人要想保持他倫盜的賊贓—東四省，而它還要出兵華北，攻我們的腹她；而我們則不但要堅守華北，驅逐敵人出冀察的境界，並且還要收回我們東四省的失地；所以這一來便要拚個你死我活，可以說生死存亡在此一舉。不過敵出全力謀我，找出全力抗敵，這戰爭的勝負决不是短時間內可以分判；在這大戰啟幕的時期，我們便要决定我們該負甚麽責任。</p>
<p>激昂，呼號，議論……這都是於事無補的，我們人人應該這樣問：‘我做甚麼？’毀家紓難，當然是最熱烈的表現；然而小的力量，也不必藐視，如像磨利大刀的工作也好，務必各盡自己的所能，擇長貢獻，使力量沒有消耗，使抗戰得到實益，然後方可望最後的勝利。</p>
<p>總之：除過漢奸，他都不能不盡自己的力量，而置身事外的！（移酬充國防捐）</p>

<h3>少女馮婉貞</h3>
<p>— 汝惠</p>
<p>在北平的近郊。離開圓明園不到十里，便是謝莊地方。從這裏望去，隱約可見北平的古城，黑沉沉的展開在地平綫上。莊的四周，還種一點樹木，在黃沙漠漠的北方，這樣的村莊，風景是很夠得上的。</p>
<p>一天傍晚，謝莊居民遠遠望見北平城裏飛起了火光，並且傳來了不甚淸晰的槍砲聲。明晨就有下鄉避難的人報吿說：“圓明園呌洋鬼子燒了，文宗皇帝逃到熱河去，京城裏也有幾處遭槍……”</p>
<p>莊上的人一聽才知道出了亂子，有一條熊裝打扮的大漢，更是氣憤；他衝着那個陌生人就問：</p>
<p>“官兵呢？他們不動手殺鬼子兵嗎？</p>
<p>”　　這京城裏的來客，回過頭來，“官兵嗎？鼻孔裏哼了一聲。隨後用着非常悲憤的態度說道：“他們只帮着洋鬼子一起搶老百姓，洋鬼子在東邊搶，他門在西邊搶，洋鬼子在西邊搶，他們在東邊搶！”</p>
<p>“這太太……”那條大漢沒有把“混帳”喊出來。</p>
<p>“太不像官兵了。”客人狠狠說完，就挑了一担雜物和他的家眷走了。</p>
<p>“三保兄，我們也得防防”。一個年紀還輕的小伙子說。</p>
<p>大漢點點頭，原來他是這一村的村長，姓馮喚三保，祖上是山東籍，從他魁梧的身材上，露出北方人勇悍的特性來。這一村人就在他的領導下幹打獵的生活。</p>
<p>過了一天，果然有數十個西兵想下鄉開小差，偷偷走近了謝莊，三保便不客氣地率領了合村的獵戶，奮勇抵敵，像步哨戰一樣接觸了，村民靠着莊子做掩護，雖然數十枝獵槍，也擊退了西兵，並且遠殺死了幾個。這個小小的勝利使大家興奮得很，全村漂漫了快樂活潑的空氣，當晚就在三保家裏排開酒筵慶宴，三保臉上堆滿了笑容，和參戰的村友高談闊論，他們說：“只要京城裏的官兵，也有我們這點能耐；皇帝就不用上熱河去。”</p>
<p>在這熱鬧的筵席上，只有三保的女兒婉貞，愁眉不展地獨自不歡，她正傍着爸爸坐下，不喝酒也不談笑‧</p>
<p>“婉貞，你呆呆坐着，有什麽不如意麽？”終於她父親開口問了。大家也用了詫異的眼光都注意起她來。</p>
<p>“父報”，婉貞憂鬱地說：“現在我們似乎得勝了，但是小敵一去大敵說不定快要來了。”</p>
<p>“那我們還有槍還有子彈……”一個年輕的臘戶滿不在乎地說。</p>
<p>“但是”，她繼續說道︰“西兵如果拿了大砲轟，那麼這謝莊不是要立該成為飛灰嗎？我怎麼能不着急呢？”</p>
<p>“呀！大砲？”大家像觸電似的，把舉着的酒杯，擎着的筷，停在空中放不下來，睜大圓眼面面相覷。在座的勇士，顯然都為“謝莊飛灰”的慘痛底預感所驚住了。大跑的黑影，把全桌人壓得不放喘口氣；相當沉默之後，三保吃吃地開口了：</p>
<p>“婉貞的話，好像不是瞎說，各位總有方法想想吧。各位……”</p>
<p>誰都啞了喉嚨，只靜靜地對望着，三保，像搜尋野味那麽謹愼地向每個座客臉上端詳了一會，一雙失望的眼光，最後才落在婉貞身上,她却鎮定的開口了：</p>
<p>“爸爸，各位父老，我聽說西兵善長火器作戰，而不慣技擊，火器的好處是遠攻，技擊的好處是肉搏。拿我們技擊的長處，攻他們火器的短處，靠着天運，或者能免掉這次的危難，——諸位看怎樣？”</p>
<p>獵戶們就議論紛紛了，有的點頭，有的搖頭，有的討論火器刀槍的比較，有的談技擊的經驗。三保也想了一會，總覺得短兵相接的一法，不易取勝：要和洋鬼子對面厮殺，不免寒心，就不肯聽從女兒的話，可是到底也想不出比女兒更好的方法。</p>
<p>婉貞退下席來，嘆息謝莊的危運，但是她决心要拯教全村，衛護老父，於是當夜召集了村中最精技擊的少年，她慷慨激昂地對他們說：</p>
<p>“諸位知道我們村莊的危難嗎？諸位知道我們自身的危難嗎？村莊的粉碎，已如纍卵，而我們的滅亡，也正像淸晨的朝露。與其坐着待斃，還不如和敵兵拚死一下。現在我已次定，不顧死活去和西兵肉搏，諸位有這膽量的，請跟我一起走吧！”她向四周少年掃視一下堅决的問：“誰敢同去？”</p>
<p>少年們平時就敬服婉貞的，又給她的嚴肅和義勇所感動了，便打雷一般的喊聲“好！”</p>
<p>女英雄快活地說：“我們這樣熱心，謝莊一定可以免去刦難了。”</p>
<p>凖備定當後，他們都是一色黑衣白刃，少年的英勇，抖動了義俠的心腸，一行五十多個，跟隨嬈貞悄悄地踏着星光出發，獵戶的身手，像猿猴一樣輕捷，離村四里有一座陰密的樹林，樹林裏的夾道，正是西兵必經之路，婉貞就指揮火家埋伏在夾道兩旁，靜候西兵來到。</p>
<p>過不多時，一隊西兵檺着火砲來了，他們正想從容地排跑轟擊。忽然一聲震天動地的吶喊，伏兵都從四面跳出來，直向敵人撲去，手起刀落，就倒了幾個，西兵措手不及，一時失去了抵抗的能力，謝莊的少年個個抱着殺敵决心，他們又受過技擊訓練，把只能自相驚擾的這愉可憐的西兵，打得落花流水，婉貞像闖入羊羣的猛虎，揮動雙刀，奮力砍殺，施出全副本領，只見她縱橫跳盡，當着刀的無不頭破血流。</p>
<p>混戰一塲，西兵敗退，她又率衆追趕一陳，使他們不能發跑。將近黎明的時候，只剩十來個敵兵，棄去大砲倉皇逃走，這一個潑辣的敎訓，使敵兵不敢再來光顧。謝莊的生命財產，就在一個十九歲的少女手中保全了。</p>
<p>這是淸咸豐十年，英法聯軍攻陷北京時的一個故事，在敵寇蹂躪平津的今日，讀到馮婉貞擊敵人的紀事，又感到埋在刺刀火藥堆裏的主將底死求和平，不勝悲憤。我們决不能再淚習“擊退”的老手法，和“誓死云云”的舊文章。何况“撤退”？　　作者</p>

<h3>Important Meetings Held by Both Chinese and Japanese Sides in Beiping and Tianjin Last Night</h3>
<p>A Pivot for Deciding the Tension in the Northern Situation: The Japanese Side Declares Troop Withdrawal Will Occur After the Overall Situation is Stabilized; Japanese Troops Arrive at Langfang and Fire Machine Guns as a Show of Force</p>
<p>[Beiping] On the evening of the 25th, Song Zheyuan convened a meeting of important figures from Hebei and Chahar at the Jinde Society. Zhang Zizhong rushed to participate, and the meeting had not yet adjourned late into the night. Important discussions were held regarding the current situation, corresponding remotely to the meeting held by the Tianjin Japanese military headquarters on the 25th. They are equally important. (Urgent telegram, 1:00 AM on the 26th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese military headquarters announced on the 25th that Japanese troops would only withdraw after the situation had been stabilized. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Song Zheyuan is extremely calm in dealing with current diplomacy. This morning, he went to the Jinde Society to confer with Qin Dechun and Zhang Weifan on important public matters, only returning to his private residence at noon. The sandbags in the remote alleys of Beiping have been ordered to be completely removed again. The general situation in the city has largely returned to its former state. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] It is reported that the Tianjin Japanese military headquarters will hold an important meeting this afternoon, and Matsui has been ordered to participate. The content of this meeting is extremely important and serves as a pivot for deciding the tension in the North China situation. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] A certain related source stated that most of the Japanese troops in the Da Jing Village, Da Wayao, Wulidian, and Shagang areas have not been withdrawn. Only a small portion has been rotated for defense. Our troops have successively retreated as agreed. The defensive area left by the 37th Division has been taken over by Zhao Dengyu's 132nd Division. Now, the Japanese side is strongly claiming that the number of troops taking over from Zhao's division is greater than the original defense force, and they have suddenly raised a protest. Upon investigation, it is clear that this move by the Japanese side is an attempt to delay the date of troop withdrawal. Their intentions are profound. Temporary peace at the moment is by no means long-lasting, and the future is predicted to be quite pessimistic. (Central News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It is widely rumored that the Mayor of Beiping, Qin Dechun, will resign and be succeeded by Zhao Dengyu. A reporter inquired with related sources, who replied that since the North China Incident occurred, Mr. Qin has been loyal, diligent, and in charge, and has worked hard. At this critical juncture in Beiping and Tianjin, as the leader responsible for local security, the central government will definitely not allow him to retire. The overall situation in North China is still in a serious state. There has been no development in the overall situation between China and Japan, and no diplomatic talks have taken place. The authorities in Hebei and Chahar are currently mediating. The central government has great confidence in Mr. Song, and Mr. Song will definitely be able to maintain his past spirit of persevering through difficulties and meet the expectations of the central government. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The stalemate in Wanping has not yet been broken. Neither Chinese nor Japanese troops have withdrawn. Although there is no fighting at present, the situation is still very tense, as the Japanese army may use force to drive away the troops of the 37th Division. The Japanese army is currently awaiting instructions from the Tianjin Japanese Command. Colonel Matsui went to Tianjin this morning to report on the overall situation. According to Japanese sources, there are currently two regiments of the 37th Division stationed in Beiping, totaling approximately three thousand men. Zhang Zizhong arrived here tonight from Tianjin to meet with Song Zheyuan. (Reuters telegram on the 25th from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At 9:40 AM on the 25th, a train of Japanese soldiers with 35 carriages, fully loaded with military supplies, arrived in Tanggu. At 1:10 PM, a train of Japanese soldiers with 5 carriages, carrying over 200 Japanese soldiers, departed from Tianjin for Langfang. Four Japanese armored vehicles stationed in Yangcun departed for Langfang on the 25th and are confronting the garrison there. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] At 7:45 AM and 2:20 PM this morning, Japanese military aircraft twice flew over Beiping, circling and reconnoitering for about ten minutes before flying northwest towards the Yongding River area. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The situation in Langfang on the Beining Railway is very tense. The Japanese troops who arrived on the evening of the 25th insisted on disembarking. After repeated obstruction by our garrison, the Japanese side fired machine guns as a demonstration. Fortunately, our garrison responded calmly, and no incident occurred. Both sides are still at a stalemate. (Central News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] At 9:40 AM and 1:30 PM on the 25th, two Japanese aircraft flew from the southeast to Beiping, circling and reconnoitering at high altitude for about ten minutes each before flying southwest. A total of three Japanese aircraft were spotted in the Nanyuan area on the 25th. At around 11:00 AM, a Japanese aircraft flew from the southeast, circling twice over Nanyuan before flying northeast. At 11:15 AM, a Japanese aircraft flew from the southwest, reconnoitering for a week before flying northeast. Again, at 2:30 PM, another Japanese aircraft came from the northwest, circling for a week in the air before flying southeast. (Central News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At approximately 7:00 PM on the 25th, over 200 Japanese soldiers traveled by train from Tianjin to Langfang, intending to station themselves at the station. Our garrison there, to avoid misunderstandings between the two sides, attempted to dissuade them. However, the Japanese troops insisted on disembarking, and negotiations are currently underway. It is reported that our garrison commander, Brigade Commander Liu, has reported to Beiping for instructions. (Central News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] There are still over 30 Japanese aircraft parked at the Limingzhuang airfield in Dongjuzi here. Four aircraft took off on the morning of the 25th to reconnoiter various locations. Several others have flown to Tanggu. (Central News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Li Shuhua and Others Visit Qin Dechun</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Representatives of the Beiping education community, Li Shuhua, Li Zheng, and others, visited Qin Dechun again this afternoon. In addition to presenting their opinions to the authorities, they inquired about the current situation and discussed it in detail. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Japanese Garrison Conducts Street Fighting Exercises</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] Over a hundred members of the Tianjin Japanese garrison conducted street fighting exercises in the Awaji-cho area of the Japanese Concession on the morning of the 25th. Gunfire erupted for a time, and citizens, unaware of the truth, were quite alarmed. (Central News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong to Implement Anti-Gas Training</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Due to the increasingly tense situation in the Far East, the Hong Kong government has decided to implement anti-gas training within days. Each store will send one person to participate, and they will graduate in three months. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Still Show No Intention of Withdrawing; Military Supplies Continuously Transported to Fengtai</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] Japanese troops along the road to Beiping and Tianjin are still actively deploying defensive works. Japanese troops at Lugou Bridge have still not withdrawn.

<h3>Four Japanese Military Attaches Stationed in North China</h3>
<p>— One Hidden Person</p>
<p>Japan's policy towards China has historically emphasized two approaches: "internal division" and "military intimidation." These two methods have been quite effective since their implementation, especially the first, which is the most effective. Because this bloodless method not only reduces scrutiny from other countries, but also requires no military force, it can be achieved easily. The method of division involves sending so-called "military attaches," "chiefs of special service organs," and other elements who exploit the weaknesses of Chinese traitors. The brief biographies of the four military attaches currently stationed in North China are detailed below:</p>
<p>㊀ Kiyotomo Katsuki, aged fifty-seven, from Saga Prefecture, is a key figure in the Saga faction of the army. He is stubborn and headstrong. He graduated from the 14th class of the Military Academy, two years later than Army Minister Sugiyama. Initially, he was just a platoon leader with the rank of second lieutenant. After the Russo-Japanese War, he was promoted to lieutenant and later assigned as a military attache to the Japanese Embassy in Germany. Before long, he was promoted to adjutant in the Ministry of the Army, section chief in the Education General Directorate, and chief of the Army's Military Affairs Section, thus ranking among the young and hawkish faction, considered the orthodox faction within the army. He was then promoted to commander of the 30th Brigade. Four years ago, he was promoted to major general and transferred to the position of Commandant of the Infantry School. Not long after, he was promoted to commander of the 12th Division. After the February 26th Incident, he was unexpectedly promoted to commander of the Konoe Division. When Senjuro Hayashi formed his cabinet and Kōtarō Nakamura became Army Minister, Katsuki suddenly jumped to become the head of the Education General Directorate. When Tashiro became seriously ill, it was very difficult for the Ministry of the Army to find a successor. Army Minister Sugiyama recalled that during the Jinan Incident in 1928, Katsuki was the chief of the Army's Military Affairs Section. He came up with a plan to urgently transfer a large force from the Kwantung Army's Outayama brigade to Shandong. However, within the Ministry of the Army, Matsumoto's regiment within the Outayama brigade was unwilling to move. Katsuki, only a colonel, engaged in a fierce debate within the Ministry with those who opposed it. Katsuki strongly argued that "the opportunity for achievement should not be missed," and strongly encouraged the regiment to seize the opportunity to send troops to Shandong. As a result, the soldiers of the Matsumoto regiment were greatly moved, and Katsuki's proposal was implemented. Thus, his reputation grew day by day. Why? Because the Northern Expeditionary Army reached Jinan and was blocked by the Japanese army, thus opening the precedent of using force to suppress China. And the brains of their military headquarters became even more reckless after this. When the incident ended and rewards were distributed, five members of the Matsumoto regiment received the Order of the Golden Kite, considered the most glorious achievement since the Russo-Japanese War. Two of them were those who most forcefully attacked the northwest corner of Jinan City. And Katsuki, because his proposal was victorious, was praised by the military headquarters. He became arrogant and exceptionally pleased. From then on, his career flourished greatly, rising to the commander of the 30th Brigade, from brigade commander to division commander. This time, when the Lugouqiao Incident erupted, Army Minister Sugiyama recalled Katsuki's proposal to block the Central Army during the Jinan Incident. After consulting with the army's top leaders, they decided that the most suitable person for the job was him. After receiving the order, he rushed from Tachikawa Airfield to Tianjin by plane and took office. As soon as he arrived in Tianjin, he treated the Chinese people as enemies and issued a so-called "Japanese Army Pacification Proclamation." Later, he issued a tough statement towards China, repeating the old trick of the Jinan Incident, telegraphing for a large army to come to China and forcing the Jicha authorities into a treaty under duress. Looking at it this way, no matter how much China endures and desires peace, hoping to prevent the situation from escalating, it is unlikely to be allowed in reality. Why? He advocated using force against China even when he was in Japan. Now that he has come to China, if he does not achieve aggressive achievements, how could he possibly stop there?</p>
<p>㊁ Heisuke Hashimoto, aged fifty-two, from Hiroshima Prefecture, is a mid-level member of the radical faction within the Army advocating aggression towards China. He graduated from the 20th class of the Military Academy in the cavalry department. He is outwardly gentle but inwardly tough, comparable to Doihara. He served as a military attache at the Japanese Embassy in France, after which he was transferred to the Staff Headquarters, instructor at the Field Artillery School, commander of the 1st Field Artillery Regiment, and chief of the Staff Headquarters section. Due to the Nagata Incident, he resigned to take responsibility. Unexpectedly, misfortune turned into fortune, and he was promoted to commander of the Chinkai Fortress. Last year, he was promoted to major general and became the leader of the fascist-leaning Greater Japan Youth Party, and was assigned as the chief of staff of the North China Garrison Army. He thought his opportunity had arrived and began to play his game of using aggression against China as a tool, engaging in extensive activities in Tianjin and Beiping. It is said that he took advantage of the Lugouqiao Incident to contact Tianjin traitor groups such as the "Greater Asia Association" and the "Puan Association" in an attempt to launch an autonomous movement against anti-Japanese elements and the 29th Army of the Jicha Political Affairs Committee. His intention was to first make Tianjin and Beiping special, and then gradually encroach on other neighboring provinces. He disagreed with Tashiro, finding Tashiro's methods too weak and believing that Tashiro's talent was not sufficient to cope with the North China environment. Now that Tashiro is dead and Katsuki has arrived, it naturally suits his taste. Therefore, the future situation in North China, if not forming a third puppet organization, they are probably unwilling to give up. Moreover, his luck-seeking mentality is even greater than Doihara's.</p>
<p>㊂ Taijiro Matsui, Colonel, aged fifty-one, from Fukuoka Prefecture, graduated from the 22nd class of the Military Academy. He secretly operated in Vladivostok and various parts of Siberia. Because he was detected by the Russian army, he committed a major espionage crime and was arrested and imprisoned. The Russian army originally wanted to execute him, but after Japanese diplomatic negotiations, he was imprisoned for three months and deported. While in prison, he learned Russian from Russian prisoners. After returning to Japan, he was selected to serve as a member of the Staff Headquarters, a member of the Army Ministry's Press Section, a staff officer of the Kwantung Army, commander of the Osaka Regimental District, and commander of the Manchurian Garrison, highly valued by the Kwantung Army. In March of this year, he was appointed as the chief of the Beiping Special Service Organ. The Jicha Political Affairs Committee, for the convenience of negotiating with the Japanese army, also hired him as an advisor. Thus, he was like a fish in water, shouldering a special mission, and began to play his favorite tricks of dividing the internal affairs of North China and absorbing pro-Japanese elements, and provoking the relationship between the central government and North China, often traveling between Tianjin, Tongzhou, and Beiping, wanting to realize his ideal of "specializing North China" and expanding the Jidong puppet organization.</p>
<p>Imao Takeo, Major, aged forty, from Nagano Prefecture, graduated from the 30th class of the Military Academy. After graduating, he immediately entered the China Section of the Staff Headquarters, specializing in the study of Chinese affairs. He was selected to serve as a military attache in various parts of China. He is even more familiar with the situation in the Guangdong and Guangxi areas, and his footprints have covered almost all of Guangdong. He served as the chief of the Fengtian Special Service Organ and is currently an assistant military attache at the Japanese Embassy in Beiping. This person is very cunning and leaves no stone unturned in his manipulation of China. He speaks Chinese and considers himself a "China expert." He often uses clever words and flattering expressions when negotiating with the Jicha authorities, gaining the trust of some pro-Japanese elements. Looking at the above four people as a whole, they all regard aggression against China as the only tool for promotion and advancement, stubbornly going their own way, and have not yet recognized the unity within China and the strength of national psychology. They are accustomed to using divisive tactics. Then, the relationship between China and Japan, I fear, will be like the relationship between Germany and France, with hatred deepening. The author recalls that when Takashi Fuse, a commentary member of the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun, came to China last year, he said to local Japanese reporters, "The constant disputes between China and Japan are all due to a group of military attaches stirring up trouble. If China and Japan truly want to be friendly, they should urgently withdraw all the military attaches back to Japan..." This sentence is truly a clear and correct view of China.</p>

<h3>Russian Newspapers Observe the Situation in North China</h3>
<p>Japanese Military's Challenge Actions. The Result of the German-Japanese Agreement.</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet newspapers recently commented on the dispute between China and Japan, all believing that the situation is extremely serious, not only for the Soviet Union, but also for the whole world.</p>
<p>The Moscow Daily News stated, "The occurrence of this dispute near Lugouqiao, Fengtai, and Beiping is not accidental. The reason why Japan chose this place as the area for its offensive is that these places are the intersection of the main railways in North China. If they can be occupied, troops can be transported to Chahar via the Ping-Sui Railway to deal with the growing anti-Japanese movement in Chahar Province. Not only that, Japan also hopes to control the entire North China, in order to open up the road for Japanese imperialism to invade northwestern and central China, and Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union are also its targets."</p>
<p>The Moscow Evening News stated that North China's wheat production accounts for 55% of the total in China, cotton accounts for 65%, wool accounts for 92%, coal accounts for 52%, iron ore accounts for 60%, and the length of railway lines accounts for 46% of the total in the country. The population is about 100 million. Once North China is lost, China will economically become an agricultural country dependent on Japan. It will feel a lack of coal and iron, the industry will have no hope of development, and independence will naturally become a problem. It is found that the latest Japanese challenge to China is the result of the military agreement between Germany and Japan. Japan is currently negotiating with Britain to divide spheres of influence in China, so it has taken this action to pressure Britain, creating a fait accompli that North China will completely succumb to Japan, and placing it before Britain. As for National Socialist Germany, it wants to take this opportunity to shift Britain's attention, so that Germany can act completely freely in Spain without any scruples." The conclusion is that "After the Shenyang Incident, Japan seized the entire Manchuria within seven days, but in North China, even though dozens of incidents have occurred, it has only managed to establish the Jidong anti-communist puppet organization after two years of hard work, which only shows that its efforts are diminishing."

<h3>Record of Hearing the Appeal Case of the Yang Assassination</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The appeal case of the Yang Yongtai assassination case was heard by the Hubei High Court yesterday morning. The defendant, Liu Lu Yin, had already submitted a petition to the Supreme Court for transfer of jurisdiction. According to regulations, the trial should be temporarily suspended. Therefore, he was not brought in for questioning. Meanwhile, the defendant, Ji Baizhou, also submitted a petition to the Supreme Court on the 21st, requesting transfer of jurisdiction. Therefore, Ji was also not brought in for questioning. When the court convened yesterday morning, the interior and exterior of the High Court were heavily guarded by military police. Dozens of onlookers were present, and all were subjected to two rounds of searches by military police before entering. At 8:30 AM, Xiong Shichang, presiding judge of the High Court's Criminal Division I, judges Hu Shitao and Yu Jianxun, clerk Ye Huixia, and prosecutor Lang Dechang took their seats in the First Criminal Court and declared the trial open. Defendants Cheng Xiechao and Cao Bingrong were assigned defense lawyer Hu Sijiang. Defendant Li Qunjian was assigned defense lawyer Xiao Buyun. Defendant Yang Qixin retained defense lawyer Li Guojiao. Defendant Wen Maoguan retained defense lawyer Lu Jihui. Yang Yongtai's family's private prosecutor's representative, lawyer Xie Shengkan, and sub-agent lawyer Huang Can, also arrived in court one after another. Yang Qixin's father, Yang Chunfu, in the capacity of a legal assistant, was also permitted by the court to attend the trial. Then, presiding judge Xiong Shichang signed the order to bring defendants Cheng Xiechao, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, Li Qunjian, Nie Jingquan, and Wen Maoguan to the court. Cheng's leg shackles had been removed, and his attitude was particularly calm. Li Qunjian and Wen Maoguan were emaciated and severely ill. They were escorted into the court by bailiffs. After all the defendants were present, presiding judge Xiong Shichang asked Cheng Xiechao, Cao Bingrong, Yang Qixin, and Nie Jingquan about their age, place of origin, address, and occupation. After this formality, he stated that because the defendants Liu Luyin and Ji Baizhou had petitioned the Supreme Court for transfer of jurisdiction, it was unknown whether the case would be tried by this court. This matter would be determined only after the Supreme Court made a ruling. However, today's investigative hearing was exploratory in nature. He hoped to gain a clearer understanding of the facts of the case. He urged them to answer all questions truthfully and without concealment.</p>
<p>Cheng Xiechao's Testimony</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, the interrogation began. (Judge asked) Cheng Xiechao, do you know Yang Erqian, also known as Yang Xiaoming? (Cheng answered) Yes. (Judge asked) Where and when did you join the assassination organization? (Cheng answered) I joined in Hankou Hotel last September. (Judge asked) Yang Erqian and Fan Qishu, did you both meet them? (Cheng answered) Yes. (Judge asked) Do you know someone named Liu Luyin? (Cheng answered) No. (Judge asked) What is the structure of the Anti-Japanese Elimination of Traitors Group? Do you know? (Cheng answered) No. You say you joined an assassination organization, didn't Yang Erqian and Fan Qishu tell you about the organization's details when you joined? (Cheng answered) Fan Qishu was my superior when I was in the army. He told me that the Anti-Japanese Elimination of Traitors was specifically for resisting the violent Japanese and eliminating traitors. I was a soldier and of course supported such an organization, so I joined. However, only a month passed between joining and the assassination of Chairman Yang. In this short period of time, they certainly wouldn't tell me the detailed inside information. (Judge asked) When did you arrive in Hankou last year? (Cheng answered) Around July or August. (Judge asked) Who instigated the assassination of Yang Yongtai? (Cheng answered) Yang Xiaoming. (Judge asked) Do you know Liang Jiubao? (Cheng answered) No. (Judge asked) How did you previously confess that after seeing Chairman Yang's photo, Ji Baizhou, Liang Jiubao, and you went to Wuchang to scout Chairman Yang's whereabouts? (Cheng answered) … (Judge asked) How many times did you go to Wuchang to scout Chairman Yang's whereabouts, and where did you scout? (Cheng answered) Three times, at Sandaogai and the Provincial Party Headquarters in Wuchang. (Judge asked) When did you assassinate Chairman Yang in front of Jianghan Customs? (Cheng answered) Around 2 or 3 PM on October 25th last year. (Judge asked) How many people were present when Chairman Yang was assassinated? (Cheng answered) Ji Baizhou and I. (Judge asked) Where did the handgun used for the assassination come from? (Cheng answered) Yang Xiaoming gave it to me. (Judge asked) Was Yang Xiaoming still in Hankou on October 25th last year? (Cheng answered) Yes, but I don't know where in Hankou he was. At this point, Cheng gave a very detailed account of the assassination that day. (Judge asked) Was Cao Bingrong present when you assassinated Chairman Yang? (Cheng answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) Are Cao Bingrong and you in the same assassination group? (Cheng answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) How did you previously confess that Cao Bingrong was standing somewhere as a marker? Was Cao Bingrong present or not? Tell the truth. (Cheng answered) I ran into Cao Bingrong around 1 or 2 PM that day. I don't know if he was present during the assassination. (Judge asked) Did you fire two shots when you assassinated Chairman Yang? (Cheng answered) Yes, I fired two shots, and Xiong Baizhou fired one. (Judge asked) Since Chairman Yang only had two gunshot wounds, did you hit him with both shots, or did you hit him with one shot and Xiong Baizhou hit him with one shot? (Cheng answered) I hit him with both shots. (Judge asked) How far away was Xiong Baizhou standing from you? (Cheng answered) He was standing by the iron railing, about three or four feet away from me. (Judge asked) You previously confessed that Yang Xiaoming told you and Xiong Baizhou to do something. What was it? It was said in code, referring to assassinating Chairman Yang. Cao Bingrong was also present at the time and did not avoid it. Is this true? (Cheng answered) Yes. (Judge asked) Do you know that Yang Xiaoming used aliases such as Xu Chao and Xu Qun? (Cheng answered) No. (Judge asked) Have you seen the Special Agent Team plan drafted by Yang Xiaoming under the alias Xu Qun? (Cheng answered) No. (Judge asked) Do you know that the Special Agent Team plan was endorsed with the words "Monthly allocation of two thousand yuan to be sent by Ru Yun"? (Cheng answered) No. (Judge asked) How much money did you receive each month for joining the assassination organization, and who gave it to you? (Cheng answered) Yang Xiaoming gave it to me, saying it was eighty yuan from Fan Qishu, but I only used thirty-odd yuan of it. (Judge asked) If you had the opportunity to escape after the assassination, would you have had travel expenses? Who would have given them to you? (Cheng answered) Yang Xiaoming.</p>
<p>Cao Bingrong's Testimony</p>
<p>Next, Cao Bingrong was interrogated. (Judge asked) Do you know Yang Erqian? (Cao answered) No. (Judge asked) Did you join an assassination organization? (Cao answered) No, I don't know anything about assassination organizations. (Judge asked) If you don't know anything, why did you previously say that on October 25th last year, you and someone else found out in Wuchang that Chairman Yang was going to Hankou, and then went to the Xintai'an Inn to listen to Cheng Xiechao's assassination? (Cao answered) No, that's just how I answered whatever the judge asked because I was afraid of being tortured. (Judge asked) Where were you when Chairman Yang was assassinated? Were you really acting as a lookout in front of Jianghan Customs? (Cao answered) No. At this point, the judge stated, "Cao Bingrong, you must know that the court of first instance has already sentenced you to life imprisonment. You have now appealed to this court, hoping to seek relief according to the law. Therefore, this court is paying special attention to your and Cheng Xiechao's cases. However, you must answer my questions honestly. If you conceal the truth, it will be harmful to yourself." (Judge asked) Do you often go to the Xintai'an Inn in Hankou? (Cao answered) Yes, because there are fellow villagers living there. (Judge asked) Did Xiong Baizhou and Cheng Xiechao have handguns? (Cao answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) Did you just hear me ask Cheng Xiechao about Yang Xiaoming telling Cheng Xiechao and Xiong Baizhou to do something? What was it? It was said in code, referring to assassinating Chairman Yang. Cao Bingrong was also present at the time and did not avoid it. If you didn't join the assassination organization, how could they not have avoided you? (Cao answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) Didn't you confess in the Capital Police Department that you were acting as a lookout when Cheng Xiechao and Xiong Baizhou assassinated Chairman Yang? Why are you denying it now? (Cao answered) I confessed in the Capital Police Department because I couldn't bear the torture.</p>
<p>Yang Qixin's Testimony</p>
<p>Next, Yang Qixin was interrogated. (Judge asked) When and where did you join the assassination organization? (Yang answered) I didn't. (Judge asked) What is your relationship with Yang Xiaoming? (Yang answered) He is a cousin who is no longer in mourning. (Judge asked) You confessed in the Capital Police Department that your group leader was Yang Xiaoming, is that right? (Yang answered) That was said under duress. (Judge asked) You once said that the highest leader in your organization was surnamed Liu. Who exactly is he? (Yang answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) Is the person surnamed Liu Liu Luyin? (Yang answered) I don't know. The judge stated, "Yang Qixin, you are very young. You have submitted written statements expressing remorse several times in prison. Now, you refuse to confess anything. This shows that you are not sincere in your remorse. You must be clear-headed and tell the truth." (Judge asked) Didn't you say that your organization was a union of frustrated military personnel, with the first step being to assassinate Chairman Yang, and then to assassinate ministers Zhang, Jiang, Yu, and Chairman Chiang, is that right? (Yang answered) … (Judge asked) You also said that you were responsible for communications and for investigating the movements of Minister Zhang and others in the capital, is that right? (Yang answered) I didn't join the organization and didn't take on any work. (Judge asked) Did you and Xiong Baizhou really scout Chairman Chiang's movements? (Yang answered) No. (Judge asked) Did you go to Lushan? (Yang answered) I did go there… (Judge asked) Did you know about the assassination of Chairman Yang? (Yang answered) I didn't know. (Judge asked) What is your father's name? (Yang answered) Yang Chunfu.</p>
<p>Yang Chunfu's Testimony</p>
<p>Next, Yang Chunfu was interrogated. (Judge asked) How old are you? (Yang answered) Forty-eight years old. (Judge asked) Where are you from? (Yang answered) Xingren, Guizhou. (Judge asked) Where do you live now? (Yang answered) Doujiying, Wuchang. (Judge asked) What did you do before? (Yang answered) I have always served in the academic world. (Judge asked) What is Yang Qixin to you? (Yang answered) He is my son. (Judge asked) When was Yang Qixin born? (Yang answered) On the second day of the twelfth month of the Wuwu year in the Chinese zodiac. (Judge asked) Do you have any statements to make today? (Yang answered) I have a written opinion to present. Everything I want to say is inside. My son is young and ignorant and was tempted by others to violate the law. I hope the court will show leniency and give him a lighter sentence.</p>
<p>Nie Jingquan's Testimony</p>
<p>Next, Nie Jingquan was interrogated. (Judge asked) Do you know Wen Maoguan and Fan Qishu? (Nie answered) Yes. (Judge asked) How did you get to know Fan Qishu? (Nie answered) I am a doctor. Fan Qishu was introduced to me and came to me for injections three times, so I got to know him. Later, he said he wanted to buy a handgun and asked me to introduce him to someone. (Judge asked) What country manufactured the gun that you introduced Fan Qishu to buy? (Nie answered) I don't know. (Judge asked) When you introduced Fan Qishu to buy the gun, did you know that he was going to use it to kill someone? (Nie answered) I didn't know.</p>
<p>Li Qunjian's Testimony</p>
<p>Next, Li Qunjian was interrogated. (Judge asked) Are you Yang Erqian's adopted son? (Li answered) Yes. (Judge asked) When did you come to Hankou last year? (Li answered) I left Shanghai on October 7th and arrived in Hankou on October 22nd. (Judge asked) What did you come to Hankou to do? (Li answered) Yang Erqian's family didn't have money, so he asked me to come to Hankou to get money from Yang Erqian. (Judge asked) Yang Qixin said that you were responsible for communications at Yang Erqian's house, is that right? (Li answered) No. (Judge asked) Why did Yang Qixin say that? (Li answered) Yang Qixin is here now. If he says I was responsible for communications, tell him to produce proof. (Judge asked) What illness are you suffering from now? (Li answered) I have alternating chills and fever. The doctor said it's very dangerous. He cried incessantly.</p>
<p>Wen Maoguan's Testimony</p>
<p>Finally, Wen Maoguan was interrogated. (Judge asked) Did you work in the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters before? (Wen answered) I worked as a temporary member of the Investigation Section of the Garrison Headquarters. (Judge asked) Was it detective work? (Wen answered) Yes, but I was just helping people. (Judge asked) The court of first instance ruled that your case was not admissible. You appealed to this court because you didn't want to be tried by a military tribunal. Regarding your identity, the court of first instance sent an official letter to the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters to investigate, and the result was that you were an extra probationary warrant officer in the Investigation Section, is that right? (Wen answered) …</p>
<p>Lawyers' Statements</p>
<p>After the interrogation was completed, the court asked lawyer Huang Can, the sub-agent of the private prosecutor's representative of Yang's family, and the prosecutor if they had any comments. Huang and others replied that they had no comments. Next, Li Guojiao, defense lawyer for Nie Jingquan, Xiao Buyun, defense lawyer for Li Qunjian, and Lu Jihui, defense lawyer for Wen Maoguan, made statements one after another. Finally, Cheng Xiechao made some statements about the motives for the assassination. At 10:30 AM, the court adjourned. The bailiffs escorted the defendants back to custody. Yang Qixin cried to his father, asking for help. Cheng Xiechao did not want to return to the detention center and was persuaded by several bailiffs to return to custody.

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>On the National Defense Line (17)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shu Di</p>
<p>The number of "groups" in each "village regiment" should be proportional to one-tenth of the number of households in the village and should not exceed that number. (A) The candidates for the so-called "village regiment leader" must meet three specific conditions: ㊀ "Have a passion for upholding fairness and justice," ㊁ "Be able to mobilize people under the age of 38 in the entire village," ㊂ "Preferably have a basic understanding of literature." (B) The selection criteria for the so-called village "deputy regiment leader" also have three points: ㊀ "Have a passion for upholding fairness and justice," ㊁ "Be able to assist the village regiment leader," ㊂ "Preferably have a basic understanding of literature." (And the "deputy regiment leader" of the "attached village" must also be able to "mobilize people under the age of 38 in the "attached village.") (C) The selection conditions for the so-called "secretary" also have two points: ㊀ "Have enthusiasm," ㊁ "Be able to assist." (And the "secretary" of the "attached village" must also possess: ㊀ Have a passion for upholding fairness and justice," ㊁ Be able to mobilize people under the age of 38 in the "attached village".) (D) The selection criteria for the so-called "group leader" are: ㊀ "Be able to be trained by the group leader," ㊁ "Be able to lead a small group to uphold fairness." (E) The selection criteria for the so-called "instructor" are: ㊀ "Have a clear understanding of the "regiment's goals"," ㊁ "And be able to enthusiastically support it." (F) The qualifications for the so-called "group member" are: ㊀ "Being in the village," ㊂ "Being between the ages of 18 and 38," ㊂ Not having any of the following circumstances: (A) "Having acts of corruption and bribery," B) "Smoking opium," (C "Being disobedient and unfilial")"Having been criminally punished," (D) "E" Being an idler with no regular employment."</p>
<p>According to the above organizational system and conditions, there are now 105 "county regiment headquarters," 1,424 "district regiment headquarters," 11,151 "village regiment combinations," 190,281 "small groups," and 1,009,094 "regiment members" in the entire province of Shanxi.</p>
<p>Second, the Mission and Task of the "Upholding Fairness and Justice Corps" - What exactly is the mission of such a large, political mass organization? I have asked many Shanxi people, and their answer is: "Unite the good people and uphold fairness and justice." This is a very general answer. To be more specific, it is: "Unite the good people, punish the bad people, eliminate social injustice, establish social fairness, eliminate the communist scourge, and strengthen the country and save the nation." Especially the latter two points, I think, can be used to divide its establishment into two periods: "Eliminating the communist scourge" is the main mission of its first period; "Strengthening the country and saving the nation" is the mission of its second period. Therefore, in its 25th and 16th degrees of work, the item "Assisting in reporting traitors" is specifically stipulated. As long as a "regiment member" reports to the "village regiment headquarters" and the county government verifies it, they can receive a reward of 100 yuan. The fifth verse of the "Upholding Fairness and Justice Song" says: "Upholding fairness and justice, the first thing is to sacrifice, sacrifice can achieve great benevolence, someone is a traitor, colluding with the enemy, execute them, execute them, show no mercy." These are clear evidence of its emphasis on "strengthening the country and saving the nation."</p>
<p>Its specific tasks roughly include the following: ㊀ "Reporting officials for violating the law and neglecting their duties," ㊁ "Reporting unscrupulous gentry and local bullies for taking advantage, being unreasonable, and behaving unfairly," ㊂ Preventing the Communist Party from turning the villages red," ㊃ "Persuading idlers and bad elements who do not engage in honest work to turn over a new leaf," ㊄ "Supporting all administrative matters in the village that benefit the people and eliminate abuses."</p>
<p>We can perhaps say that it is a mass organization with a very strong political nature. Its task is to "organize the masses and train the masses," using collective power to clarify political darkness and eliminate social injustice; its mission is to prevent communism internally and resist the country's enemies externally. And at its root, it is still about upholding what they call "fairness and justice."</p>
<p>Third, Its Work. The Shanxi authorities say that the most successful aspect of the "Upholding Fairness and Justice Corps" in the past two years has been reporting violations: from May to September of the 25th year, in four months, a total of 5,607 cases were reported. The people who were reported included not only senior officials but also county magistrates, judges, prison wardens, public security chiefs, inspectors, district chiefs, and anti-communist defense chiefs, etc. There were reprimands, demerits, dismissals, and even executions. However, these are only passive efforts to clean up the officialdom. If viewed from the standpoint of a mass movement, I believe that the greatest achievement is in the area of "organization." Just imagine, in Shanxi, a society full of ancient customs, it was possible to organize 1,009,094 people in just two years. This is truly an extraordinary feat! The next most successful aspect of its work, I think, is "propaganda." When I was in Shanxi, I saw slogans and Spring Festival couplets created by the "Upholding Fairness and Justice Corps" everywhere. In theaters, cinemas, and other public places, there were often propagandists speaking about "upholding fairness and justice." They repeated "Upholding Fairness and Justice" with great enthusiasm in the Shanxi dialect. Once, I bought a bag of candy, and when I opened the paper bag, a piece of paper flew out. On it was printed: "Punish bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people," "Support good officials, good gentry, and good people," and a horizontal inscription with four characters: "Upholding Fairness and Justice." This propaganda can truly be called "all-pervasive!"</p>
<p>Its work in the 25th year was divided into "daily" and "assistance" sections. There were six types of daily work: ㊀ organization, ㊁ training, ㊂ mutual assistance, ㊃ mutual evaluation, ㊄ reporting, ㊅ propaganda. There were four types of work to assist other agencies: ㊀ assisting in reporting traitors, ㊁ assisting in promoting local goods, ㊂ assisting in banning opium and drugs, ㊃ assisting in training young people and women (temporarily absent in the 25th year). One pilot project: "Corps members delivering and receiving documents." The work in the 26th year can be divided into ten items: ㊀ selection, ㊁ training, ㊂ mutual assistance, ㊃ mutual evaluation, ㊄ reporting, ㊅ propaganda, ㊆ assisting in reporting traitors, ㊇ assisting in promoting local goods, ㊈ assisting in banning opium and drugs, ㊉ assisting in training the people. Plus one item: "Corps members delivering and receiving documents." Compared with the 25th year, there are two differences: ㊀ The first work in the 25th year, "organization," has been cancelled in the 26th year and changed to "selection." Because in terms of organization, it has already expanded to more than one million people, which is almost all the able-bodied men in Shanxi Province between the ages of 18 and 38, there is no need to do more organization work; the current work is naturally to select cadres. Moreover, in this year, the "group leader" is also elected by the "group members" instead of being approved by the village regiment leader. ㊁ The work of assisting in training the people has officially begun. In accordance with the regulations of the National Government, it is divided into three items: A able-bodied men training, B youth training, and C women's training. Among them, the women's training item is organized by the "People's Training Committee" of each village, and the "Upholding Fairness and Justice Corps" assists it.</p>

<h3>The Greatest Effort Has Been Made for Peace</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In the past few days, our country's military and political authorities have made the greatest effort for East Asian peace. However, the invading troops are still entering the pass in a steady stream, intending to permanently occupy our Hebei territory. According to yesterday's Beijing telegraph, not only did the Japanese troops east of Wanping City not withdraw, but they also occupied the highlands of Shagang Village as an artillery position, forcibly conscripting our farmers in the area to dig long communication trenches reaching Fengtai. This action proves that Japan has no sincerity in the so-called troop withdrawal negotiations a few days ago, and our unilateral implementation of troop withdrawal is simply another trap. Even so, we believe that the heroic soldiers on the front line will not be discouraged by this. When the invaders challenge again, they will definitely be able to inflict a fatal blow on the invaders with the support of the people across the country.</p>
<p>The expanded all-out war at that time would be even more tragic to imagine. However, since the Japanese side has shown such an attitude, we will not vainly hope to avoid this tragedy. Since the September 18th Incident, the speeches and actions of our central and local military and political authorities have shown the world that China loves peace and is determined not to seek war. Even after the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, our country's authorities' painstaking efforts to maintain peace were witnessed by the world. However, the invaders disregarded world opinion and insisted on using means that would destroy peace to dominate our great nation with thousands of years of history. How can we continue to endure and compromise? Therefore, the four points of Chairman Chiang's presentation of our country's position on the Lugou Bridge Incident greatly inspired the 450 million soldiers and civilians across the country. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, we are now prepared to make the final sacrifice to defend our country's territory and sovereignty.</p>
<p>We believe that this kind of national determination has great significance. Because historical facts show that the revival of a nation is mostly through a baptism of blood. At this moment when the gunpowder keg in the Far East has already caught fire, it is clear that only the Japanese imperialists can withdraw the sparks they have thrown to prevent the world's human race from suffering a major explosion. However, we feel that this hope is very slim.</p>
<h3>Romania Inquires with Britain About Organizing Anti-Communist Front</h3>
<p>British Attitude is Cold; Polish Spies Discovered on Russian Border</p>
<p>[London] It is generally known that Romanian King Carol II, when he inquired here the other day, proposed that Poland and Romania organize an ideological "epidemic prevention line" to prevent Bolshevism from spreading to European countries, and inquired with British politicians about this matter, but the British attitude was extremely cold, and the policy of organizing any kind of ideological group was opposed by Britain, (Havas News on the 24th).</p>
<p>[Moscow] The government recently issued a bulletin stating that on the 5th of this month, two people were discovered in front of the Slavik Ziek border defense post on the Soviet-Polish border, entering Russian territory from Poland, and firing at a team of Russian border guards. After the border guards opened fire and retaliated, the two people were shot and killed. Various pieces of evidence and documents for engaging in espionage were found on their bodies, proving that one of them was Polish border guard Lieutenant Cirofsky. The Soviet government has instructed its ambassador to Poland to protest to the Polish government (Havas News on the 24th via Central News Agency).</p>
<h3>The Bessarabian Sovereignty Question</h3>
<p>Russian Newspaper Raises Old Issues, Urging Romania to Reflect</p>
<p>Rome - Romania's Bessarabia Province, originally Soviet Russian territory, was only recognized as Romanian after the European War in 1920 by the Five-Power Ambassadorial Conference. The Soviet Union has never explicitly recognized it. The Soviet "Pravda" newspaper yesterday, because Romania's political orientation has recently seemed to please Poland over the past few months, raised the issue of Bessarabian sovereignty again to urge Romania to reflect. The "Business Daily," a radical socialist party newspaper, commented: Regarding the cession of Bessarabia Province to Romania, the Soviet government only indirectly and temporarily recognized it. In 1934, Romania's former Foreign Minister Titulescu, in London, requested Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov to jointly issue a statement, saying that the province is currently under the administration of the Romanian authorities and can be considered to belong to Romania. There are actually nuances here. It seems that Romania's foreign policy is more advantageous if it is close to the Soviet Union; otherwise, the question of the province's sovereignty will inevitably be raised again. At this moment, Romanian King Carol II has already engaged with German leader Hitler and plans to host German Aviation Minister Göring after returning to his country. "Pravda's" re-raising of the province's sovereignty issue will naturally have a considerable effect. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>German-Puppet Economic Collusion</h3>
<p>French Newspaper Reveals Inside Story</p>
<p>◎Translated by Wai Lun She, Published in the Beijing Daily: According to reliable sources, a manager of a certain German trading company in "Manchukuo," named Knoerl, is said to be a representative of Germany's three major steel manufacturers. Knoerl, with the status of a Taipan (chief manager) of a German trading company, after arriving in Changchun, immediately began negotiations with the "Manchukuo" authorities for a loan. It is said that the German side is willing to assist "Manchukuo's" industrial construction plan with economic power. It is reported that the amount of this loan is 100 million Manchukuo Yuan, "exclusively for" the purpose of "Manchukuo's" industrial construction. It is also said that this loan is only of a short-term nature, as Germany is also currently experiencing poverty.</p>
<p>The conditions of this loan that can be made public include two items, the contents of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The total amount of the loan is 100 million "Manchukuo" national currency, provided by related German trading companies doing business in Manchuria. The repayment period is set at six years.</p>
<p>Article 2: With respect to this loan amount, the "Manchukuo" authorities can order machinery, etc., from Germany without having to pay in cash, but it should be guaranteed by the Japanese government. The negotiations regarding this credit loan were held in Changchun in early July. As for the parties involved in the negotiations, in addition to the "Manchukuo" authorities and representatives of the three German trading companies, representatives of the Kwantung Army also participated, as some of the construction is quite related to military national defense. According to general observation, this German-Manchurian loan agreement was actually initiated by the Japanese side, because the Japanese side needs German assistance in carrying out its five-year construction plan in "Manchukuo." According to news from the Tokyo newspaper in Japan, Japan originally planned to negotiate a loan with the British side, just as Britain did to China, and apply it to "Manchukuo." However, the British side politely declined the request, as the negotiations between Britain and Japan in London had not yet been completed. Having no other choice, Japan turned to Germany for negotiations, and because Japan and Germany have a relationship of the Anti-Comintern Pact, it succeeded once negotiations were held. However, in order to avoid stimulating Chinese sentiment, it was changed to German merchants in Manchuria coming forward. It is now reported that the detailed items of the loan treaty are being negotiated by the Japanese, German, and Manchurian sides.</p>
<h3>Transatlantic Regular Airmail</h3>

<h3>Explosion at Yugoslavian Armory</h3>
<p>Cause of Death and Injury to People and Animals Unknown</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital - Forty-five tons of gunpowder suddenly exploded today at the military depot in Kragujevac, killing at least five people and injuring more than forty. Hundreds of cattle, horses, sheep, and other livestock nearby were killed or injured by the explosion. A local factory and residential buildings were destroyed by the fire, which also spread to nearby forests. (Central News Agency, 25th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital - After an explosion occurred at a chemical plant in Kragujevac, the town is now guarded by troops. It is reported that there were no deaths. Another report stated that one person was killed and several were injured, and several houses were also destroyed by the explosion. The town is a center for the manufacture of military supplies. The authorities are now conducting strict censorship of news to prevent conflicting reports. At the same time, the army authorities have also begun investigating the truth of the explosion.

<h3>German Workers' Income Increases</h3>
<p>▲Haitong News Agency, Berlin Dispatch - According to the National Trust Bureau's report, the total income of all German people in 1936 was 61,500,000,000 marks, of which the income from salaries and wages was approximately 35,000,000,000 marks, an increase of 2,500,000,000 marks compared to the previous year. This increase is not due to the increase in labor prices, but due to the increase in the number of workers and the extension of working hours. In terms of quantity, there were a total of 18,000,000 workers in 1936, which is even more than the 17,870,000 in 1929. In terms of working hours, the average daily working hours per person in 1935 was 7.41 hours, while in 1936 it was 7.66 hours. Last November, it was further extended to 7.8 hours. This year, due to the implementation of the Four-Year Plan, there will inevitably be a greater need for extension. German workers who work more than 48 hours per week must have their wages increased by 25% above the normal rate, so the result is one of the reasons for the general income. In addition, the increase in senior workers and the establishment of disability insurance are also reasons for increasing income. The stability of salaries and wages in Germany indirectly prevents the rise in prices. From November 1935 to November 1936, the German cost of living index increased very slightly, only from 121.9 to 124.3.</p>
<h3>Another Black Person Sentenced in the Case of Insulting White Women</h3>
<p>Sentenced to 75 Years in Prison</p>
<p>Tuscaloosa, USA - The case of a black man raping a white woman, which shocked the world, has now come to a devastating end. There were a total of eight defendants in the case. Two had already been sentenced. Today, another person named Wim was sentenced to 75 years in prison. The other five had their lawsuits withdrawn by Alabama. According to the case, two homeless white women were in a freight car near Scottsboro and were raped by black men. Several white men in the car were also beaten and insulted. During previous trials, radical groups in the country mostly claimed that the treatment of black people was unfair, so the state government also included black people in the jury. This is a pioneering initiative in Alabama since the North-South conflicts. (24th)</p>
<h3>Göring Issues Order to Control National Steel in Germany</h3>

<h3>The Fall of Brunete, the Northwestern Bulwark of Madrid</h3>
<p>Gains and Losses Affect the Overall Situation of the War, the Rebel Offensive is Irresistible, Two Strong Government Brigades Completely Annihilated</p>
<p>Navalcarnero Dispatch - Special dispatch from Havas News Agency reporter, Brunete Town, on the northwestern outskirts of the capital, was captured by the Nationalists yesterday. The most advanced were three cavalry teams, who furiously shot at the defenders amidst the flying dust and charged into the town's main streets. Previously, twelve squadrons of Nationalist aircraft had bombed the Government troops' positions in the town. The Government troops' aircraft were unable to resist due to their small numbers. The column led by Nationalist Central Route Commander General Varela broke through the Government troops' lines under the cover of aircraft. However, the Government troops still fought hard to resist with cannons and mechanical weapons. The Nationalists then launched a second attack and entered the town around noon. The Government troops then retreated in a panic. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Navalcarnero Dispatch - Special dispatch from Havas News Agency reporter, it is heard that in recent days, more than two thousand soldiers of the Government troops on the central front have been captured. All of them are poorly clothed, exhausted, and have been taken in and accommodated by the Nationalist authorities in designated detention areas. In addition, it is heard that two of the Government's most combat-capable brigades have been almost completely annihilated. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid - Brunete Town, on the northwestern outskirts of the capital, is a strategically important location. Its gains and losses are sufficient to determine the outcome of the Madrid battle, so the two sides fought fiercely for it. It has been gained and lost countless times. As of the time of dispatch, the town has been completely recaptured by the Government troops. The battle yesterday was very fierce. The Nationalists first used cannons and aircraft to bombard the Government troops' positions in the morning, and then bravely advanced. By noon, they had occupied many of the houses in the city. However, the Government troops were unwilling to show weakness and immediately launched a fierce counterattack, driving back the Nationalists. The battle resumed in the afternoon. Under the cover of cannons and a large number of tanks, the Nationalists again charged towards the town, pursuing the Government troops and abandoning the town. The Government troops stationed in the town were the 11th and 14th Division troops, and they immediately withdrew safely, regrouped outside the village, and took a roundabout route. They re-entered the town in the evening and street fighting immediately broke out. The two sides engaged in close combat, and the Spanish Moroccan indigenous troops belonging to the Nationalists also arrived at this time to join the battle. By late at night, the Nationalists could not hold out and retreated. However, it is generally believed that the Nationalists will launch another attack. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid - The two sides are still fighting fiercely on the Brunete Town front on the northwestern outskirts of the capital. The Nationalists have assembled a large number of troops and military supplies there, including a large team of Moroccan indigenous soldiers and many tanks. They launched a fierce attack on the Government troops' positions in the afternoon. The Government troops also fiercely resisted. For a time, cannons and aircraft dropped bombs and bombed, and the battlefield was raining bullets. However, Brunete Town has always been in the hands of the Government troops. Later, because the cannons used by the Nationalists had a larger caliber, the Government troops were forced to retreat slightly. Until the evening, the Nationalists continued to attack, trying to estimate Brunete Town, because the town is located at the intersection of the Estrada Madura Province and the Avila Province, and it is a place that the Nationalists must fight for. (Central News Agency, 25th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid - The Madrid government announced today that Brunete Town, which the government troops and rebels have been fighting over for a long time, is located sixteen miles west of the city. The rebels have now been defeated, abandoning many corpses and war equipment. According to news from Seville, the Nationalist army used tanks as a vanguard to attack the town. Military experts believe that the gains and losses of the town are related to the overall situation of the civil war. Judging from the news on the government side, at least for now, the government troops seem to have the upper hand. Today, there was also a major air battle in Madrid. The sound of anti-aircraft guns firing was continuous. The rebels used forty trimotor German aircraft and dozens of fighter planes to attack. According to a government report, they have been repelled. (24th, National Electricity)</p>
<h3>British Attempt New Efforts on the Spanish Issue</h3>
<p>The Non-Intervention Conference Convenes Today to Comprehensively Discuss a Compromise Plan</p>
<p>[London] - Britain will soon make new efforts to resolve the deadlock in the non-intervention plan. After consultations between Foreign Secretary Eden and representatives from Germany and France, it is expected that the sub-committee will convene a meeting on Monday to discuss new proposals for the British compromise plan. It is said that the British compromise avoids the procedure of discussing the proposals in order, and replaces it with a comprehensive question, distributed to representatives of various countries, for them to fill in one by one. And because of the interconnected relationship between the proposals, it is specifically stated that the questions are a whole question, and the order of the proposals in the original plan book and the current comprehensive question is not important. In this way, the true attitude of various governments towards various issues can be clearly obtained. It is also heard that the ambassadors of Germany and France have given preliminary agreement to the above-mentioned compromise. (Central News Agency, 25th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London - German Ambassador Ribbentrop held talks today with the Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Lord Plymouth, Chairman of the Adjustment Committee. According to diplomatic sources, Ribbentrop expressed to Plymouth that the British government intends to submit a table of questions to the countries concerned, asking them to answer each item listed in the British compromise plan one by one. Germany believes that this British suggestion will allow the negotiations that have been suspended to continue. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>King Leopold's Suggestion of Sympathy from All Countries</h3>
<p>The United States Believes it is Timely, Germany Seeks Equal Economic Rights</p>
<p>[Washington] - Secretary of State Hull said today that King Leopold of Belgium's suggestion to establish a permanent non-political institution to study economics and promote world peace is very timely, and that the current international relations rely more on a solid economic basis. However, Mr. Hull did not want to express whether the United States will participate in this organization in the future. (24th, National Electricity)</p>
<p>[Washington] - Regarding the letter from Belgian Leopold III to the country's Prime Minister Celan, suggesting the establishment of a permanent International Bureau for Economic Research, Secretary of State Hull recently expressed his opinion, saying that he supports various institutions that can make the opinions of politicians from various countries on international economics more clear. He will support all organizations of this nature. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Berlin] - After King Leopold of Belgium suggested the establishment of an international economic research institution, people in political circles here expressed satisfaction, saying that people around German leader Hitler have repeatedly requested that Germany should obtain equal rights in economics. If an international economic research institution is established, it will be especially beneficial to Germany's request. In addition, the German General Report said, "This kind of research institution should directly apply to the three countries of England, France, and the United States, asking them to pay attention to the two issues of raw material distribution and payment methods. Germany hopes that this kind of application can be understood by the three countries of England, France, and the United States." (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels - After King Leopold III sent a letter to Prime Minister Celan, suggesting the establishment of a permanent international economic research institution, all the evening newspapers here carried long articles to comment on it. One of the evening newspapers said, "Since the Great War, our country has been making continuous efforts in the international arena to remedy the economic turmoil. The King's letter to Prime Minister Celan is a new stage of this effort. The scope of the Belgian mission (referring to Prime Minister Celan being entrusted by the British and French governments to investigate the world's economic situation) is so broad that it cannot be measured by numbers. In short, it is nothing more than wanting to make people in various countries believe that normal and effective economic cooperation is possible. If normal and effective economic cooperation cannot be established, then the world situation will have no possibility of being saved." In addition, the socialist "People's Daily" said, "Regarding the issue of mutual cooperation between the nationalities of various countries, whether it is economic or governmental, the head of state and the government have expressed their enthusiasm. As for the King's letter this time, it recognizes that economic issues and various political events are all interconnected. It means that economic cooperation and political cooperation should be planned and considered together. We deeply hope that the world can understand this, because economic cooperation, if it is only beneficial to a part of the country, and this part of the country not only destroys freedom and rights within the country, but also wants to threaten other international countries, then there is no international cooperation to speak of. This is obvious." Also, some people in political circles rumored that Prime Minister Celan was about to step down, so the King and the Prime Minister agreed that the King would send a letter to the Prime Minister, asking him to serve as the director of the International Economic Research Bureau in the future, so that Celan could save face when he leaves office. However, the last paragraph of the People's Daily's article strongly denies this and believes that it is completely inaccurate. (Central News Agency, 24th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>According to a military investigation in Paris, there are a total of 80,000 foreign volunteers in the Spanish rebel army, and only 20,000 in the government army. If the volunteers are completely withdrawn, the government army will suffer extremely heavy losses, because General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebel army, can ensure that the original Spanish army is not affected, while in the government army, officers above the rank of platoon leader are all volunteers, and very few natives can drive tanks, use machine guns, or fly airplanes.

<h3>Traitors Active in Henan and Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Secretly Surveying Terrain and Spying on Military Intelligence, Colluding with Bandits to Disrupt Security</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Dispatch: After the Lugouqiao Incident, there have been many foreigners and traitors traveling to the inland areas of Henan and Shaanxi. In addition to secretly surveying the terrain and spying on military intelligence, they are also tasked with colluding with bandits to instigate riots. Therefore, recently, bandit leaders Cui Erdan and Li Molin have sent representatives to Zhengzhou to contact certain parties. The original traitors in Zhengzhou are also preparing to disrupt the local area and sabotage transportation by force. The authorities have convened many security meetings for days in a row, decided on prevention measures, and strictly implemented them, so the traitors have not dared to take any action. Several staff members and family members of the Japanese Consulate in Zhengzhou recently went to Hankou under the leadership of Matsui Masutaro to prepare to return to their country. However, the person in charge of the Japanese Consulate expressed that they would not leave Zhengzhou for the time being, as they are intensifying their activities and work.</p>
<p>Also, the traitor Yu Shaoxiang brought a camera from Tianjin to various places in Henan and Shaanxi to secretly photograph the terrain of fortresses. He was arrested and interrogated by the police station branch station in Xuchang on the 20th. (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Rice Merchants Decide to Prevent Rice From Aiding the Enemy</h3>
<p>Hereafter, Rice Purchases in Anhui from Hebei Must Be Certified by the Local Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu's status as a rice market is due to it being a gathering place for rice rather than a rice-producing region. Therefore, market conditions generally shift based on supply and demand. Those who manage and procure rice in Wuhu traditionally come from the Guangdong, Chaozhou, Yantai, and Ningbo groups. In recent years, the Guangdong and Chaozhou groups have been affected by the domestic sale of foreign rice, leaving the Yantai (Tianjin) group as the sole major outlet market. According to rice industry statistics, over 800,000 shi of white rice and over 500,000 shi of wheat have been shipped this year. Corn amounts to 200,000 shi, and broad beans and silkworm beans exceed 100,000 shi. The sales channels for the aforementioned wheat and miscellaneous grains, in addition to Yantai and Tianjin, also include Qingdao and Tangshan. These are mostly collected by Japanese trading companies and the so-called "Procurement and Transportation Guild" here. Last month, business was particularly brisk. Even after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred and the Shanghai Customs began an embargo, the Wuhu industry still declared that they had not seen a clear order from Wuhu and tried to operate at risk. Only after learning that the Tianjin Merchants Storage was forcibly occupied by enemy troops did things gradually become quiet. Those who had already completed their transactions stored their goods in warehouses or used bank drafts to obtain working capital. Recently, in light of the domestic situation, another meeting of all rice industry committee members was convened. They resolved to prevent the enemy from using traitors to come to Wuhu for procurement under false pretenses, which would be equivalent to directly supplying the enemy with grain. However, in order to consider the daily food needs of compatriots in North China, it was decided that from now on, those coming to Wuhu from North China to purchase rice must have a letter of certification from the local Chamber of Commerce before procurement and transportation would be permitted. At the same time, various circles in the Suzhou area are organizing an anti-enemy support association, which is also paying close attention to the large-scale export of Anhui rice to North China and intends to implement effective auditing. As a result, although the rice and wheat market conditions have inevitably been slightly sluggish recently, purchases of relief rice by various parties in Wuhu and the rush of flour mills in Shanghai and Zhenjiang to collect wheat in Wuhu offset each other nicely, and market prices have remained stable. Currently, top-grade machine-milled rice sells for 9.4 yuan, brown rice for 8.4 yuan, and wheat ranges from 8.1 yuan to 8.45 yuan. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Rural Hubei</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jun</p>
<p>General Situation of Rural Huanggang</p>
<p>Huanggang's rural production is mainly rice, wheat, cotton, and miscellaneous grains. The third district is rich in tobacco leaves, which generated approximately 2 million yuan in national currency in sales to various places last year. The Xinzhou area produces cotton, reaching 150,000 dan (piculs) per year, with each dan worth approximately 40 yuan. It is a pity that cultivation methods are not improved, resulting in the production of mostly coarse cotton. Otherwise, the sales value would be even greater. Other products such as bundled hemp and indigo produced along the river, and the wheat crops of Luohuo and Yadan, are also very abundant, which can be said to fully utilize the land. However, forests are often damaged by wildfires and theft, leaving bare mountains everywhere, which is a pity. It is necessary to promote afforestation and prohibit destruction.</p>
<p>Farmland is measured at 2.5 dou (pecks) or 60 square zhang (units of length) per mu (unit of area), which varies from place to place. The land tax and surcharges per mu are approximately five to six jiao (fractions of a yuan). The relationship between landowners and tenants is divided into two types: "tizhuang" and "yongdian". "Tizhuang" land is wholly owned by the landlord, who temporarily leases it to tenant farmers for cultivation. The landlord collects grain once or several times a year, based on the tenant's lease agreement. If the tenant is in arrears or short on grain payment, the landlord can freely take back the land and recruit another tenant. "Yongdian," on the other hand, involves the tenant paying a lump sum fee and only paying rent grain once a year. The landlord has no right to take back the land and lease it to another tenant. In terms of produce, farmers should be able to provide for themselves, but unfortunately, due to consecutive years of floods and droughts, crop yields have decreased, and prices have fallen. The burden of taxes and levies is too heavy, and corrupt gentry and local bullies add insult to injury. In this environment, the rural economy is inevitably headed for bankruptcy, just like other counties.</p>
<p>Banditry has also been rampant in recent years, and local order cannot be maintained. Prosperous families have long since moved to the cities, making the rural areas even more difficult. Usury has emerged in response. Farmers borrow money at monthly interest rates as high as four or five fen (cents) or even one jiao. Pawnshops, five or six in number, offer slightly lower interest rates, but the appraised value is too low, and the redemption period is too short. Farmers have nothing to pawn other than their clothes and bedding. Fortunately, since 1934, the Hubei Provincial Bank Cooperative Committee, under Liu Wei, has designated this county as one of the counties to promote cooperative undertakings and has established a rural cooperative guidance office. Local farmers were initially skeptical but gradually became trusting. There are now 117 formal cooperatives and 7 federations. The Farmers Bank of China is responsible for providing loans. In the past year, loans to formal cooperatives totaled 38,411 yuan, and 1,000 yuan to preparatory cooperatives.</p>
<p>Education is ostensibly quite developed. There is a provincial Huangzhou Junior High School, and Cangzibu has the private Zhengyuan Middle School, which was founded with donations from Xu Yuanquan. There are a total of five complete primary schools, a central primary school in Tuanfeng, and more than ten private elementary schools. Unfortunately, most of them are in the cities, which is inevitably uneven. The joint defense primary schools exist in name only. Although they have been reorganized recently and have improved compared to before, the salaries are too low, and teachers cannot settle down and serve. The number of literate farmers in the county is only about 15 percent. Popularizing social education is urgent.</p>
<h3>Baoshan</h3>
<p>Strengthening Firefighting Equipment</p>
<p>The firefighting efforts in this county have been well-managed, but due to funding issues, equipment has not been adequately strengthened. Now, the authorities believe that firefighting is extremely important during this extraordinary period and have decided to strictly supervise various rescue organizations to thoroughly reorganize existing fire engines. At the same time, they are raising large sums of money to purchase new firefighting equipment to meet needs.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Discovery of Two Male Corpses</p>
<p>In the river southeast of Beiqingdun Village, Wusong Port, this county, an unidentified male corpse was discovered on the 23rd. The village chief of the township retrieved the corpse, which was approximately thirty years old, had a knife wound on its back, was bare-chested, and wore black suit pants. The village chief has reported this to the local police station and requested the county to examine the body. In addition, a male corpse surfaced in the river near Xiaoshu, west of Wusong Port, yesterday morning. It was approximately twenty years old, wearing a white cloth short shirt and black pants, resembling a farmer. The Lujiabang police station has dispatched officers to investigate and locate the deceased's family members to come forward to identify and prepare the coffin.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Rampant Outbreak of Plague in Zhouzhuang</p>
<p>In Zhouzhuang Township, the second district, true cholera has recently broken out, spreading rapidly through the villages. It initially affected mostly children, with more than twenty deaths. Now it has spread to the young and strong. The township health branch is trying to eradicate it, but the epidemic is very severe, with dozens of deaths per day.</p>
<p>Robbery of Shop in Sanguan Township</p>
<p>Hu Yongtao, a resident of Sanguan Township outside the east gate, runs a sundries store. On the night of the 23rd, three hooligans suddenly came, claiming to buy cigarettes, and went directly to the accounting room, stealing 54 yuan in legal tender and a gold ring. Afterwards, the township head reported it to the district and then to the county for apprehension.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Nanping Section Begins Operations</p>
<p>The various projects on the Nanping section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have been largely completed. The engineering vehicles have been able to reach Pingxiang directly since the 18th of this month. In order to facilitate travel along the line, tickets will be sold on the material vehicles that run daily. It is understood that the two major bridges across the Ganjiang River and Yuanshui River in this section are being rushed to completion and will be finished by August 15th. The Railway Bureau plans to begin operations on August 1st, with a mixed passenger and freight train running once a day between Nanchang and Pingxiang in sections.</p>
<p>Setting Up a Bureau to Exploit Copper and Zinc Mines</p>
<p>In order to plan the exploitation of copper mines in Qingtian and lead-zinc mines in Zhuji, the Zhejiang Construction Department has proposed that the Provincial Government establish a preparatory office for the Mining Bureau. The candidate for director has already been internally determined and will be announced once Director Wang Zheng returns to Zhejiang. It is planned to start work on August 1st and formally establish the Mining Bureau three months later to gradually exploit the mineral resources. Its organization will be based on business principles, with the first step being to make it able to balance income and expenditure.</p>
<p>Inspection of Sanmen Bay Railway Completed</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, under orders, planned to build the Sanmen Bay Railway to connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. It commissioned the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to send engineer Xiong Zhengbo to organize a survey team to conduct the survey. After more than a month, the work has been completed, and he returned to the province yesterday to report.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Achievements of the Central Hospital</p>
<p>Since Xia Yumin took over as the director of the Ningbo Central Hospital, he has been actively reorganizing and making every effort. Mr. Xia is rich in scholarly spirit and is famous for specializing in obstetrics and gynecology. The internal medicine doctor Sun Jingshi, surgery doctor Zhang Fangqing, Ding Xiajun etc. are all rich in experience, and carefully stick to their posts. Therefore, the hospital is getting better and better every day. Recently, a woman from Nanjing, Xu Dai, came to Ningbo specifically for treatment from Shanghai. According to her, there was a hard lump in her abdomen, which started around September or October last year. Shanghai doctors thought she was pregnant, but later felt that the condition was different, and recently she had severe pain. Her family was worried. Having long heard of Mr. Xia's reputation, she travelled to Ningbo with her family. After Mr. Xia examined her carefully, he determined that it was an ovarian cyst that required surgery. She was immediately hospitalized and properly treated. The surgery went very well. She was safely discharged from the hospital in less than twenty days. Afterwards, according to the patient's family, Dr. Xia's surgery skills are superb, and the stitches are neat and unnoticeable. The strictness of his disinfection procedures is unmatched elsewhere. Therefore, there are very few problems after the operation. It is really fortunate that Ningbo has such a good hospital.</p>
<p>Investigation of County Accounting</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that the county accounting system has a profound impact on the improvement of county administration. It has specially sent accounting guidance committee members Yan Yilin and Pan Jingxing to Ningbo to investigate accounting matters in the seven counties under Ningbo's jurisdiction for study and improvement.</p>
<p>Murder Case Occurs on Yangshan Road</p>
<p>Ye Axiang, a resident of Dalaolai Street, Ninghai, and Xu Jiafa (a rickshaw puller) from Taiwan, have recently been working under foreman A Shui to load cement for the new post office building on Chezhan Road. At noon on the 23rd, A Shui gave each worker one yuan for lunch money, which was handed to Jiafa for distribution. Axiang did not receive any money and argued with Jiafa on Yangshan Road, resulting in a fight. Axiang was seriously injured and collapsed. The police officer on duty took the two to the police station. As the case involved injury, it was transferred to the court prosecutor's office for investigation. Unexpectedly, Axiang died before the cart reached the entrance of the court. The court took Jiafa into custody pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Detective Team Leader Accused</p>
<p>Rao Chun, the leader of the detective team of the Jiaxing County Government, is being accused in this incident because Xie Baoshu, an employee of the Shengye Silk Store in Shengze (23 years old), eloped with Shen Fubao (18 years old), a neighboring woman, on July 5, taking 2,200 yuan of store funds. The store reported this to the detective agencies in various places for investigation, stating that they would offer 30% of the recovered money and goods as a reward. Xie's whereabouts were then discovered by his guarantors, Wang Bingqiu and Chen Mengxiong, who found him in Hangzhou. They also found a deposit book for 1,700 yuan at the Shanghai Bank of China and 224 yuan in cash. On the 14th, they were arrested by the detective team at the Dadong Hotel in He Yu. Later, due to the failure to resolve the reward issue, the man and woman were detained for many days. The head of the Rao team dispatched personnel to Shanghai to withdraw the deposit without authorization, withholding a bonus of 570 yuan. The silk store claimed that it had found the escapee itself, and that it had withheld the bonus and illegally detained the people. It filed a complaint with the county government, accusing them of being illegal. Magistrate Weng summoned Rao, the leader of the group, for questioning on the 24th, and transferred him to the court for interrogation in the afternoon. After interrogation, he was ordered to be released on bail with a written guarantee of 800 yuan. At the same time, the county government has appointed Yuan Xiaojun, a service member of the supervisory office, as the head of the detective team.</p>
<p>Change of Water Police Captain</p>
<p>Fang Weizhou, captain of the fifth team of the Jiaxing Water Police, has resigned for some reason. The provincial government has appointed Xu Pucheng to take over and also serve as the director of the Salt Patrol Station. Xu has now taken over.</p>
<h3>Yuyao</h3>
<p>Preventing Rice Crop Pests</p>
<p>Insect pests have recently occurred severely in Qinggang and other townships in Yuyao, spreading to more than a dozen townships. Rice crops have been damaged. The insects resemble green caterpillars. On the 22nd, rice stem borers and two- or three-brood moths were also discovered. The county government has repeatedly received requests from various townships for prevention and control, and has sent a telegram to Wu Guohua, director of the insect control area in Zhengxiang, urging farmers to take measures to prevent and control the pests in order to avoid their spread.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Completion of Xianju Bridge</p>
<p>The east gate of Xianju County, Taizhou, is an important transportation route between Lin and Xian, and the end point of the Lin-Xian Highway. Because the Baishui Creek cuts off the north and south, traffic is blocked whenever there is heavy rain and flash floods. The county government, in view of this, launched a fundraising campaign last winter to build a large stone bridge, which is more than 600 feet long and 11 feet wide. The project took more than six months and was fully completed on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Good Condition of Cotton Seedlings in the Reclamation Area</p>
<p>Due to favorable weather, the new cotton in the Jiangbei coastal reclamation area is growing very well. According to the initial survey, it is estimated that 6 million mu of cotton fields can yield 3 million dan of seed cotton. The Cotton Production Improvement Office will implement unified control of cotton seeds this autumn and has established large-scale ginning factories in Nantong, Dongtai, and Yancheng to eliminate inferior varieties.</p>
<h3>Taixian</h3>
<p>Pressing Merchants to Contribute Funds for Guiding the Huai River</p>
<p>The merchants in this county should contribute 64,000 yuan for the labor-for-hire fund for the project of Guiding the Huai River into the Sea in Jiangsu Province. However, only 5,000 yuan has been received from the three chambers of commerce, less than one-tenth of the total amount. Recently, the Finance Department telegraphed the county government, ordering it to strictly urge the merchants to pay the funds so that the project could be concluded. The county government called a meeting of the chambers of commerce and decided that, in addition to the part of the county's land survey fee that the county government had diverted to offset the amount, there was still a shortfall of 30,000 yuan. The chambers of commerce were required to strictly urge merchants to pay the money and remit it to the county within the month. To ensure success, the county government has dispatched county committee members and police to the Chenggianghai Chamber of Commerce to assist in urging the debt-owing merchants to pay. However, most merchants are still delaying on the pretext of sluggish business and the summer slack season. It is difficult to expect the full amount to be collected in just over ten days.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Local Bank Collects Salt Tax on Behalf</p>
<p>The Anhui Local Bank has been in operation for more than a year, and its business is booming. Branches and agencies have been established in 63 counties throughout the province. The bank and its agencies collect tobacco and alcohol taxes and tuition fees in various places. The president of the local bank headquarters, Cheng Zhenji, has also negotiated with the Wuhu branch of the Bank of China to have the local bank collect all the salt taxes from various places along the Anhui shore. He has dispatched personnel to Datong, Sanhe, Tangjiagou, Xiangan, Zongyang, Yuncang, and other places to prepare.</p>
<p>Initiating Donations to Comfort the Troops</p>
<p>Teachers and staff of the Qingzhou Normal School Affiliated Primary School initiated a donation campaign on the 23rd. The teachers and staff each donated one yuan as a start, and then ordered all students to freely donate candy money every day in order to gather a large sum. The school's four to five hundred students are all willing to enthusiastically contribute, and as soon as they reach a certain amount, they will remit it to the northern front to comfort the troops. Other schools will also hold similar events within days.</p>
<h3>Raozhou</h3>
<p>Establishing a Fish Fry Farming Ground</p>
<p>Poyang Lake in this county is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and is one of the five largest lakes in China. It extends from the Wu Le Changjiang to Hukou, spanning more than 300 li (unit of distance). It is very rich in fish. Most of the fish fry in the country is supplied by the shores of the lake. However, because the fishermen along the lake only know how to fish and do not know how to farm, the output is decreasing day by day. In order to develop the aquatic products of Poyang Lake and increase people's income, the provincial government plans to establish a fish fry farming ground in this county to engage in farming and has included it in this year's plan. The Construction Department is actively planning and implementing it.</p>

<p>Economic Special</p>
<h3>From the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition to Future Industrial Trends</h3>
<p>— Pan Wenan</p>
<p>Among the Shanghai Municipal Government's tenth anniversary celebrations, the industrial exhibition was the most significant contribution to national economic construction. It was divided into three parts: a machinery industry exhibition, a handicrafts exhibition, and an industrial safety exhibition, each held at separate venues. After a thorough observation, I have gained many insights and believe that the future direction of industry in our country needs to change significantly compared to the past.</p>
<p>I believe that the displays at this machinery industry exhibition can break with past habits and create a new era in the history of industrial exhibitions. The exhibits were divided into four categories: physical objects, models, manufacturing processes, and work demonstrations. The work demonstrations showed viewers the manufacturing process and working procedures everywhere, which aroused the interest of the Chinese people in emerging industries. For example, Dalong Iron Works, Zhonghua Iron Works, Zhuya Iron Works, Gongqin Iron Works, etc., displayed their manufactured machines in an active way and tested them on the spot. The quantity was not large, but the quality was extremely refined, which was enough to show the progress of our national industry in recent years. The handicrafts exhibition area collected a wealth of items, although not limited to Shanghai, but mostly products from Shanghai. Some say that it is not easy for handicrafts to achieve these results under the pressure of mechanization, but if we observe with a critical eye, we can understand that most handicrafts have gradually adopted simple machinery and have moved from manual to semi-mechanical. The industrial safety exhibition displays were divided into eight categories: photographs, wall charts, statistics, charts, models, instruments, treasures, laws and regulations, and books. Each category of exhibits included facilities and guidance on factory safety and hygiene, statistics on factory accidents, physical objects of accidents, factory safety inspection instruments, etc. Everything related to industrial safety was included. After this industrial exhibition, I believe that those who run industries in the future should pay attention to at least the following five things to guide future industrial trends.</p>
<p>First, the future progress of industry must determine the overall plan. I believe that the superiority of national industry lies in its ability to produce in large quantities and to standardize, so that it can cope with ease and not be eliminated. The biggest shortcomings of the exhibits at this exhibition, except for the well-known factories, are that the styles are inconsistent, the production volume is not large, and they cannot be delivered on time. The situation of extending handicrafts is particularly obvious. I hope that after this exhibition, any factory, when starting up, must first have a comprehensive plan. At the beginning of each year, it must also determine the direction of this year's work based on the business trends of the previous year, so that it can seek corresponding results and not be constrained. The working machines in each factory must pay attention to precision and accuracy, and they should not be greedy for cheapness and affect the standards of the products.</p>
<p>Second, the future progress of industry, whether machine-made or handmade, must first study the tastes and psychology of customers in various places. The biggest shortcoming of the industrial exhibitions visited by various provinces this time is that they did not study whether there are domestic products to replace the popular imported goods in various places. At the same time, Shanghai industrialists did not pay attention to this issue when they visited and inspected various places. I heard that Mr. Zhu Gengtao of Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory went to North China to inspect the cotton market and found that there are two kinds of colored cloths that are very popular among middle-class families. Mr. Zhu returned to Shanghai and spent a month making these two kinds of cloths, which have already sold well in Shandong and Hebei provinces. I hope that in future exhibitions, the products of each factory should be marked with the sales of various cloths, which province sells which kind, and which place sells which kind, which is more meaningful and more likely to attract the attention of visitors from various provinces.</p>
<p>Third, in the future, industry should focus on people's daily needs and the replacement of foreign goods. The domestic goods displayed at the machinery industry and handicrafts exhibitions have not fully paid attention to this point. For example, Dalong's textile machines and Huacheng's motorcars can be said to completely replace foreign goods; at the same time, there are many decorations and toys, although many have the value of national art, but there are more appreciators and fewer inquirers, and most of them still feel that they have not reached the realm of perfection. Therefore, some people still say that the exhibits this time are too broad but not refined, and I hope that the exhibitors will pay attention to them urgently.</p>
<p>Fourth, in the future, industry should pay attention to the national defense industry and heavy industry. The exhibits of heavy industry were particularly lacking in the exhibition. For example, the bamboo steel bars of Xinhe Xing Steel Plant and the various acid alkali products of Yongli Plant were not recruited as much as possible. In this national crisis, what national defense industry do we rely on to maintain our territory? What heavy industry do we rely on to supply? When we think of this, we feel chills down our spines. I hope that industrialists will stop engaging in unnecessary and pointless competition among themselves in the future, causing excessive or contradictory products, and instead join the army and put more effort into heavy industry and national defense industry.</p>
<p>Fifth, the first thing to consider in the future direction of industry is the utilization of local raw materials. For example, the yu grass in Sichuan Province is the raw material for leather hats, the wool in North China is the hat blanks, and the reeds, madder, and yellow grass in Jiangbei, Taicang, and Jiading are all excellent raw materials for any woven fabric. If two or more colors are added, they will not only be liked by the Chinese people but also welcomed by foreigners. China is a country of raw materials, and raw materials are widely produced everywhere, which means that industry can be set up everywhere. If used properly, labor and transportation can be saved everywhere, and the pricing can be low. Local resources depend on this. Unfortunately, there are not many exhibits in the industrial exhibition that can utilize local raw materials to create new and unique things, which shows that natural resources have not been fully utilized.</p>
<p>All of the above is based on the opinions of visitors and my own humble opinions during the ten-day tour of various industrial exhibitions, and I would like to offer them for the authorities to discuss. As for the industrial safety exhibition, it is a brand-new undertaking that I could not have imagined ten years ago. I especially hope that those engaged in industry will pay special attention to its contribution to the future development of industry, which is no small matter.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Rice and Wheat Control in the Current Stage</h3>
<p>— Li Yinbei</p>
<p>Rice and wheat control is essentially a branch of the controlled economic system. According to the theory of controlled economics, to implement rice and wheat control, there must first be a way to control rice and wheat. It is impossible in principle to rashly implement rice and wheat control without a way to control it. Today, the reality of rice and wheat control in our country is becoming increasingly clear. The choice of methods for controlling rice and wheat is indeed a task that cannot be ignored. The scope of this article is to discuss the methods for controlling rice and wheat today. The methods for controlling rice and wheat can be summarized into three types: ㊀ Consumption control of rice and wheat, ㊁ Production control of rice and wheat, ㊂ Transportation and sales control of rice and wheat. Now, I will introduce these three methods separately.</p>
<p>㊀ Consumption Control of Rice and Wheat</p>
<p>The consumption of rice and wheat is different from the consumption of general consumer goods. In terms of the consumption of general consumer goods, due to the disparity in purchasing power between the rich and the poor, the consumption volume of the people cannot be determined by the people's "desires." However, from the perspective of rice and wheat consumption, the consumption volume of each person cannot be determined by wealth. Therefore, in terms of the nature of rice and wheat consumption, rice and wheat are a kind of consumer goods with "social nature." Consumer goods with "social nature" should not be operated by private individuals for profit. Therefore, the purpose of controlling rice and wheat consumption is not for profit but to provide for the people. Therefore, its control methods are nothing more than the following two: ㊀ The government directly manages the distribution of rice and wheat nationwide; ㊁ The government indirectly supervises people's rice and wheat consumer cooperatives. The former control method can be called absolute control of rice and wheat, such as the rationing system implemented by the socialist Soviet government in the past. The Ration System belongs to this category. The latter is relative control of rice and wheat. It is entirely based on the principle of fairness and mutual assistance among the people to organize rice and wheat consumer cooperatives. It adopts a government-supervised, privately-operated system to control the consumption of rice and wheat nationwide. Now, should our country adopt the first method or the second method to control rice and wheat consumption? Our country is a country of the Three Principles of the People, and it cannot implement this policy of directly managing rice and wheat distribution like socialist Soviet Russia, in terms of the principle of statehood. Secondly, in terms of the national conditions of China and the Soviet Union: China has always been a society centered on the family economic system, and the socio-economic situation of Soviet Russia is also not close. From these two perspectives, the only way to control rice and wheat consumption is to organize national rice and wheat consumer cooperatives, which is easier to approach. However, from the perspective of implementing consumer cooperation, the following five issues must be given deep attention: ㊀ The private opening of rice boxes for edible purposes, such as brewing wine, making sugar, and feeding livestock, is of course something that consumer cooperatives cannot interfere with. Before the central government controls consumer cooperation, it should comprehensively plan in advance how to restrict brewing and sugar making, and how to find substitutes for feeding livestock. ㊁ The people of our country have low intelligence and lack a deep understanding of cooperation. Often, consumer cooperatives, in order to attract customers, stipulate that members and non-members receive dividends equally. If this continues, the number of non-members will inevitably increase sharply; and the person in charge of the cooperative, because of the need to be a member, non-members, although their numbers increase daily, have no opportunity to participate in the affairs of the cooperative. Therefore, the affairs of the cooperative may be manipulated by a few people! ㊂ Before rice and wheat are sold at half price, the price cannot be controlled by the cooperative. And merchants who sell rice and wheat, in order to compete with the cooperative, will inevitably drop their costs drastically in order to sell more. This situation is of course unfavorable to the cooperative. ㊃ According to the consumption cooperation public covenant, all sales are generally made on a cash basis. It is not possible to accept general customers who are accustomed to credit sales. However, at present, rice and wheat merchants are in the habit of extending credit. Consumer cooperatives, under this situation, should devise practical methods to remedy this. ㊄ Those who understand the operation methods of cooperatives may not be familiar with the situation of rice and wheat, and those who understand the situation of rice and wheat may not understand the operation methods of cooperatives. It is of course not easy to find a person who is well-rounded in all aspects, and at the time of the national rice and wheat control mobilization, the issue of the people who control consumption cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>㊁ Production Control of Rice and Wheat</p>
<p>The purpose of rice and wheat production control is, in general, to achieve a balance between rice and wheat production and consumption. However, strictly speaking, in peacetime, it is necessary to achieve (A) Chinese people eating rice and wheat from their own country; (B) three years of cultivation leaving enough surplus for one year of consumption. And in wartime, it is also necessary to manage the rice and wheat industry of the people nationwide; such as threshing, hulling, milling, grinding, etc. To implement the so-called food national defense line. Therefore, if China wants to embark on the path of controlling rice and wheat production, the following prerequisites must be paid attention to first: ㊀ The so-called Chinese people eating rice and wheat from their own country, in other words, is not eating foreign rice and foreign wheat. To achieve this goal, we must first pay attention to increasing rice and wheat production. According to American Beker's estimation, the arable land in China accounts for about 29% of the total land area; land not suitable for cultivation accounts for more than 70%. And the land that has already been cultivated is only 18,000 acres. In principle, it seems that we can engage in cultivation. However, the border areas are not suitable for cultivation due to the climate and geographical conditions. Therefore, in the short term, there is little hope for an increase in cultivated land. However, the original fertile land is being encroached upon by folk tombs, and the cultivated land is shrinking day by day; in recent years, due to the construction of traffic roads, the occupation of useful land by the people is even more numerous. To say to increase production is truly impossible! ㊁ If the cultivated area cannot be expanded, we must retreat and engage in the improvement of agricultural technology; such as the promotion of improved seeds, the implementation of pest control, the improvement of irrigation, and the improvement of soil fertility. According to this type of agricultural technology improvement, it is effective in collective farms. The agricultural land in our country has always been subject to the inheritance method of different sons. Therefore, the fragmentation of cultivated land is unique to any country. Using this fragmented land to implement this new type of agricultural technology, even if there is an effect, the effect will be extremely small. ㊂ To control the national rice and wheat industry, we must first amend the unequal treaties. Otherwise, the national rice and wheat will be controlled by the government, while the imperialist food industry in China will still refuse to comply. For example, in the wheat flour market in North China, it is almost entirely manipulated by merchants from a certain country. Observing this situation, controlling the national food industry without controlling the food industry of foreigners will not create an opportunity for the imperialists to disrupt the market.</p>
<p>㊂ Transportation and Sales Control of Rice and Wheat</p>
<p>Someone once calculated that the cost of transporting the same amount of grain a few hundred miles in China is more expensive than the price of food shipped across the Pacific Ocean from the United States to China for sale. No wonder there is a surplus of rice and wheat in one place and a panic of rice and wheat in another place in the same province in China at the same time. Therefore, the responsibility of rice and wheat transportation and sales control is to regulate the surplus and deficit of rice and wheat nationwide. However, to regulate the surplus and deficit, it must be done through the consistent operation of the four institutions of purchasing, storing, transporting, and distributing rice and wheat nationwide. There are still many problems hidden in these transportation and sales institutions. If you don't believe it, please try to list the following: ㊀ The prerequisite for purchasing rice and wheat is the control of rice and wheat prices. Because without this, rice and wheat cannot be centralized. However, according to the international economic situation in the country, the price of rice and wheat in China is not only closely related to the price of rice and wheat in the domestic producing areas; it also closely follows the price of rice and wheat in foreign producing areas. Therefore, the determination of rice and wheat prices in our country is sometimes affected by the price of rice and wheat in domestic producing areas; sometimes it is dominated by the price of rice and wheat in foreign producing areas. Therefore, even if the control of transportation and sales can control the price of domestic rice and wheat, the external attack of foreign producing area prices is still a considerable problem. ㊁ The prerequisite for transporting rice and wheat is the soundness of the domestic transportation economy. The transportation construction in our country in recent years has generally focused on highways. However, highways can only be used for military transportation and passenger transportation. Due to the inconsistency of economic conditions, freight transportation has not been opened. Rice and wheat are a kind of heavy cargo, which is obviously not suitable for highway transportation conditions. Therefore, even if highway construction advances rapidly, it will not be of any benefit to the transportation of rice and wheat. As for the railway: although the railway can transport rice and wheat, it suffers from the short railway mileage and other problems. The transportation of rice and wheat is still not competent. Recently, the Yuehan Road has been opened to traffic. In theory, Xiang rice entering Guangdong should not be a problem. However, the facts show that the rice shortage in Guangdong Province is urgent, and Xiang rice is still slow to arrive! From this example, it can be seen that the key to the rice and wheat transportation problem must still be the soundness of the transportation network. ㊂ The method of collecting and distributing rice and wheat in our country has always been to distribute it to local customers through a collection and distribution center. For example, Shanghai is the collection and distribution center for rice and wheat nationwide. Its distribution of rice and wheat has always been procured by the three major customer groups of Nanyang, Beiyang, and the Yangtze River. Then, from the local customer groups to the rice and wheat firms, to the rice and wheat retail stores, and to the rice and wheat consumers. The organization for controlling the distribution of rice and wheat must have rice and wheat purchasing cooperatives in various places to replace the customer groups in the commercial organization. If not, and if transitional or accommodating methods are used, then how can we supervise these rice and wheat intermediaries who are mainly for profit under the principle of equal distribution of rice and wheat to provide for the people.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the above three control methods, the three control methods in the current stage are actually interconnected. To implement rice and wheat control, we should integrate consumption, production, and transportation and sales. There must be no delay. At present, in addition to the control of transportation and sales, the Ministry of Finance has established the National Food Transportation and Sales Bureau. As for the control of consumption and production, the government has also had plans in recent years. The former is like the planned establishment of the National Food Administration, and the latter is like the "China Rice and Wheat Self-Sufficiency Plan" drafted by the Rural Reconstruction Committee last time. It can be said that there has been considerable planning for the entire national rice and wheat control problem. However, the problems will only be known after actual practice; therefore, I wrote this article based on the possible scope of consideration. It is for reference before controlling rice and wheat. As for the problems encountered in actual practice after implementing the entire rice and wheat control in the future, we have no way to imagine them at this moment.</p>
<h3>World Wheat Reserves and Countermeasures China Should Take</h3>
<p>— Jingshi</p>
<p>Food and military equipment are the key to victory or defeat in wartime. Therefore, all countries prepare for the occurrence of war and explore methods of food control or food management in advance to ensure that supply and demand correspond at that time, so as to increase or extend the country's combat power. For example, the Food Administration of the United States, the Food Control of England, and the Food Supply Control of France and Russia are all methods used in wartime, which are different from the general agricultural policies in peacetime. Various economic protectionism around the world pay special attention to wheat. Because all countries mainly eat wheat, even those who usually use rice and wheat interchangeably use wheat because it is easy to carry and most suitable for military needs after being made into dry food. Therefore, wheat is no less than the center of the food problem in the modern extraordinary situation.</p>
<p>In the past year or two, countries around the world have focused on expanding their armies and are concerned about the food problem in wartime in the future. The measures that have been implemented, such as the establishment of a food council in the United States last year, and the implementation of a part of its national defense plan, intend to greatly increase the accumulation of wheat, that is, to transfer all of the approximately 50 million bushels that Canada can supply for this purpose. There are also proposals to increase from 50 million bushels to 67 million to 76 million bushels. Italy is also actively absorbing the import of foreign wheat. On January 30 of this year, it implemented the reduction of the wheat import tax from the original tax rate of 32 lire per 100 kilograms to 18 lire, and the flour tax from 49 lire to 27.5 lire. Argentina, due to the increased need for wheat, cancelled the minimum price regulation in December last year, which is equivalent to the cancellation of export subsidies. Lithuania, fearing that the export of wheat would affect the people's food and national defense, ordered a ban on the export of wheat last winter.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the goal of various measures taken by countries is to absorb wheat reserves for wartime use. However, according to estimates from all parties, the import volume required by various countries for world wheat consumption last year was 52.8 million bushels, which is less than the previous estimate, and the actual supply of exports is only 47.5 million bushels, which is less than the estimated number. Among them, 30 million bushels are absorbed by the United States, which was not available before (because the United States is a wheat-producing country, so the import volume handled by merchants in various needed countries is often less than half of the 900 million bushels in 1928-9.</p>
<p>At the same time, the world's wheat production last year has been reduced to the lowest level in nine years ㊀ Last year, the three major production areas of the United States, Australia, and Canada experienced a severe drought after three years of poor harvests, and the output was even worse than before. Therefore, the United States continued to be a wheat-importing country for the previous two years, at 1.934 million bushels. ㊁ Italy's wheat reserves have decreased, and the condition of new wheat is also poor, so it is more eager to hoard. ㊂ Although Argentina has increased slightly, the number that can be exported is still small. ㊃ In Australia, various countries are competing to buy its wheat reserves; ㊄ It is not necessarily reliable that the Soviet Union's agricultural technology has improved. Because of the repayment of short-term debts and the increase in gold production, it is not necessary to dump a large amount like in 1930-1931.</p>
<p>Due to the above situation, Chicago wheat rose to $1.43 last December. It has been rising ever since. According to the poor harvest, the rise in grain prices is only a temporary phenomenon. If countries hoard for war purposes, the trend will not be easy to decline.</p>
<p>Our country's food relies on both rice and wheat, which are used to regulate each other. However, in this autumn when the international situation is increasingly tense, and with our Eastern neighbor coveting us, we should also plan for self-sufficiency as early as possible. In reality, our country's wheat production has always been insufficient, and a large amount of flour and wheat is imported every year. In the most recent five years, the import of wheat reached 10,714,634 quintals in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and decreased to 1,168,093 quintals last year. The import of flour was 1,957,113 quintals in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and also decreased to 310,018 quintals last year. The reason for this decline is that on the one hand, our country's wheat production has slightly increased, with the harvest last year estimated at 46.1 million piculs, an increase of 7.7% compared to the previous year. On the other hand, the above-mentioned various situations have made it impossible for wheat from the United States and Australia to be imported into our country, and at the same time, it has been affected by it, forming a phenomenon of high flour and wheat prices, which has a profound and significant impact on the future of the people's food.</p>
<p>The reason is ㊀ Last year, the world wheat price generally rose, and although domestic needs felt insufficient, consumers were unwilling to import foreign wheat at a high price: ㊁ Japan's wheat harvest last year was 6% less than in previous years, and at the same time, it retaliated against Australia's wool trade policy, so it turned to our country to purchase a large amount of flour and wheat. According to the customs records, the export of wheat last year was 316,808 quintals, which is close to the more than 400,000 quintals exported in the 20th year, and reached 49,356 quintals in the first five months of this year. The export of flour last year was 92,172 quintals, which also exceeded the previous years, most of which were purchased by Japan. Therefore, the domestic shortage is becoming more and more acute, so the price of flour and wheat is becoming more and more expensive, creating a serious situation for the people's food. This year, the domestic provinces are suffering from floods and droughts, and the harvest has decreased. The hoarding policies of various countries in the world have not changed, and there is a tendency to increase. And Japan's purchases are more than before, so even though the new wheat is on the market recently, the prices in various producing areas have risen sharply. The news of the Japanese purchasing in various places has been recorded in various newspapers, especially in Wuhu, so the highest wheat price in the local area once reached 9.3 yuan per bag, creating a new record for the past years, which is more expensive than rice by 34 cents. This phenomenon is indeed rare in recent years. It is even more unreasonable at the time when the new wheat is on the market. Try to list the prices for the same period in the past five years as follows, and the abnormal bear state will be revealed.</p>
<p>As shown in the numbers in the table, compared with the same month last year, the price of American wheat has increased by 92%, the price of wheat in Hankou and Jinpu Road has increased by about 50%, and the price of flour has increased by more than 60%. In theory, when the new wheat is on the market, its price must fall, but in the past two years, it has suddenly reversed and risen. It is no wonder that the price continued to rise in the second half of last year, reaching a huge amount of one times higher than the price in June and July of the previous year in December. This year is also the same, and with the poor harvest and Japan taking the opportunity to purchase, the price of flour and wheat has risen even more without end. Under this situation, we are already in a situation of food panic among the people in peacetime, and if the previous Lugouqiao Incident breaks out, if there is no way to develop a peaceful path, then the expansion into a war between the two countries is a matter of course. Our country has always lacked thorough food control methods, so once it falls into an extraordinary situation, the urgent need to prepare the national military food and the food for the rear will be more urgent than in any country.</p>
<p>Recently, the export of wheat has been prohibited by the Ministry of Finance, and more than 30,000 bags of wheat flour transported from Shanghai to Tianjin have also been detained by Shanhaiguan. We believe that this move is indeed a necessary measure at the moment. Recently, the local food groups in this city have agreed that in the future, domestic transshipment of food for military use must be certified by the local military authorities, and for civilian use, it must be certified by the chamber of commerce. However, in various trading ports in our country, there are many Japanese military and civilians stationed. If they are driven by high profits, local traitors will inevitably sell them privately. Recently, it has been heard that there is a decision to ban the shipment of flour, rice, and wheat to Dalian, Lushun, and Qinhuangdao. In addition, it is hoped that from now on, the national food control mobilization should be expanded and carried out quickly!</p>
<p>The main points of food control are ㊀ Investigate the supply and demand situation; ㊁ Set up food depots for storage; ㊂ Operate transportation and sales by the government; ㊃ Advocate frugality; ㊄ Transform the existing market institutions, etc. However, judging from the current state, the matter is as urgent as the stars, and we should first start with the first and third points. Regarding the investigation of the supply and demand situation, we can instruct the local military and political organs of each province, city, and county to jointly investigate and register the local storage and transportation and sales situation with the chamber of commerce and the food association, so as to facilitate military use and rear allocation. On the one hand, in order to facilitate wartime transportation, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation can jointly operate transportation and sales, so as to speed up the time and transportation. The other points must be determined by the fullness of time, and they cannot be achieved suddenly. We hope that before this war opportunity has not expanded, and when the new grain is about to be released in succession, the whole country will promote it as soon as possible, which is tantamount to increasing the strongholds of national defense.</p>

<h3>Dried Fruits and Vegetables</h3>
<p>Improved Quality of Orchid Seeds: All sand and mud must be sifted out starting August 1st.</p>
<p>Orchid seeds are a type of spice needed by dry tobacco and general incense candle stores. If the price is right, incense candle stores will buy more. However, because the quality of orchid seeds produced in Zhangzhou is not pure, there is often fine sand mixed in. The owners think that the flowers and sand are of equal value, and they have not been screened and improved. However, they do not know that the sales have been hindered because of this, and the foundation is in danger of being shaken. It is also heard that incense candle stores mainly use sandalwood for spices. For example, if four ounces of sandalwood are replaced with orchid seeds, one catty will be needed because it is mixed with sand, branches, and leaves. Having learned from this, the industry association has drafted a method that, starting August 1st, the market price of all orchid seeds will be based on the standard of sifting out the mud and sand. If there are goods mixed with sand, they must be sifted out before the price is determined. At the same time, all the shops have sent letters to the owners, requiring them to sift out the sand in the future to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and to promote domestic goods. Sandalwood is a foreign product, while orchid seeds are local products.</p>
<p>Daylily Inventory Runs Short</p>
<p>According to reliable information from Zhenjiang and Xuzhou, the supply of daylily has recently become scarce, and the production price has rebounded. According to the inspection of the current stock here, most of it has been sold. For example, the ones purchased by the Quanzhou and Taiwan gangs totaled about 400 large packages, and the Guangdong gang also purchased about 200 large and small packages. If all of them are packed and delivered today, the more expensive goods will be in short supply. However, there are still stocks of the lower-grade Zhongxing vegetables, but they do not sell well. Yesterday, the market price for Xuzhou vegetables was 25.5 yuan, the price for ordinary vegetables was 25 yuan, the price for Daxing vegetables was 24.5 yuan, the price for ordinary vegetables was 23 yuan, and the price for lower grades varied. According to the current situation, there will be no sign of recovery within a week.</p>

<h3>Withdrawal of Japanese Marine Corps from Posts - Situation in Zhabei Eases</h3>
<p>Okamoto States No Intention to Expand - Citizens' Associations Announce, "Do Not Panic"</p>
<p>According to the China News Agency, the Japanese Shanghai Naval Marine Corps claimed last night (the 24th) that a soldier named Miyazaki went missing. Consequently, troops were dispatched to guard the border between the Hongkou area and the Chinese Concession, inspecting pedestrians and vehicles, and even intruding into the Chinese territory. The situation was serious and unusually tense. Until dawn yesterday, the Japanese military posts had withdrawn one after another, and the situation gradually eased. The tense atmosphere of the previous night was completely swept away. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Okamoto Visits Acting Mayor Yu</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, Japanese Consul General Okamoto, accompanied by Secretary Fukui, visited Acting Mayor Yu at the Municipal Government. He expressed gratitude to the Chinese side for assisting in the investigation of the disappearance of Japanese soldier Sadao Miyazaki and for their attitude in handling the case. He reiterated the details of the incident, requested the Municipal Government to continue the investigation to find the missing soldier, and emphasized that the Japanese side had no intention of expanding the matter. The sentries deployed last night had already been withdrawn this morning. He hoped to inform all parties to avoid misunderstandings. Acting Mayor Yu responded that after receiving the report, the Municipal Government immediately sent staff to the scene to investigate and contacted the Shanghai Municipal Police. Many suspicious points were discovered. For example, the Japanese youth Okazaki Yoshio mentioned in the report could not be found at the address provided. Furthermore, the incident occurred in a prosperous area, and the time was not late at night. How could no one have witnessed the event? The Japanese Marine Corps, without waiting for the truth to be clarified, mobilized fully armed, and their sentries crossed the boundary of the Concession, causing rumors and a tense situation. It was deeply regrettable. If the Chinese side had not adopted a calm and composed attitude, the consequences would have been unimaginable. He requested that the relevant parties be informed that they must act cautiously in the future. It is better to consult beforehand than to express regret afterward. This would make it easier to maintain local security and avoid misunderstandings. Regarding the request for assistance in the investigation, the Municipal Government considered it appropriate, because the Japanese side had, based on unfounded reports, speculated that the soldier was abducted by Chinese. The Municipal Government did not need to wait for the Japanese request to be eager to know the truth of the case. After about half an hour of talks, the Japanese Consul General departed.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Posts Withdraw Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Japanese Naval Marine Corps dispatched posts to inspect pedestrians and vehicles in the Hongkou area and the border with the Chinese Concession on the previous night, and even intruded into the Chinese territory, stationing troops in the Tiantong'an Road and Ji'erpai Bridge area. Until dawn yesterday morning, the Japanese military posts withdrew, leaving only a small number of troops stationed at the Japanese Elementary School on North Sichuan Road, the Japanese Girls' Elementary School on Ouyang Road, the Liu San Garden on Jiangwan Road, the Hanaya Sake Brewery on Garden Street, and the Japanese cemetery at Baziqiao. The Japanese troops stationed in the Liu San Garden were still searching passing pedestrians and vehicles. Liang Fuchu, the chief of the Beizhan Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, visited Takeda, the chief of staff of the Japanese Special Marine Corps, yesterday morning at 9:30 AM to negotiate a halt to the searches. Takeda accepted and agreed to stop the searches.</p>
<p>Tokyo Newspapers Publish in Large Font</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th - All newspapers on the morning of the 25th published in extra-large font the disappearance of the Japanese soldier in Shanghai and the fact that the 37th Division of Beiping had not yet fully withdrawn. However, the Asahi Shimbun took a more cautious stance. According to a Shanghai telegram from the Domei News Agency, the discovery of a military cap and collar badge was reported by a young man claiming to be Okazaki Yoshio, who handed them over to soldier Yanagita at North Sichuan Road. While Yanagita was reporting by phone, the young man escaped. An investigation into his claimed residence revealed that there were no Japanese residences there, making the situation highly suspicious. Miyazaki was granted permission to stay out overnight on the 24th, so his whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<p>Concession Adds Posts - Shanghai is Peaceful</p>
<p>As the situation in the urban area is as described above, in the Concession, all sections of the extended road connecting to the urban area, such as the main roads of North Sichuan Road, have had additional police posts. Japanese soldiers are stationed at the Japanese Elementary School on North Sichuan Road, and Japanese patrol teams are also frequently seen. The situation in the Caojiadu Zhongshan Road area of ​​western Shanghai is as peaceful as usual. The Toyoda Spinning Mill, both inner and outer mills, has traditionally had Japanese troops stationed there, with no new developments. However, there has been a slight increase in police and Concession police patrols on the main traffic roads of the extended roads.</p>
<p>Consulate Holds Meeting - Japanese Warships Arrive in Succession</p>
<p>Although yesterday was Sunday, the Japanese Consulate General on Huangpu Road remained open as usual. Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun and important officials of the Municipal Government also went to the office. The commander of the Japanese Marine Corps, Okawauchi, and the naval attache of the embassy, ​​Tadao Honda, visited Japanese Consul General Okamoto Kisei yesterday morning at 11:00 AM and held a meeting to discuss the handling of the matter. After the meeting, Okamoto, accompanied by Secretary Fukui, went to the Municipal Government at 11:30 AM to visit Acting Mayor Yu and decided to visit the authorities of the Public Concession again today to request continued assistance in the investigation. Furthermore, the Japanese Residents' Associations also convened a temporary board meeting at the Japanese Club on Pong Road yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to decide on their stance. The "Kuri No. 1," a destroyer belonging to the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy stationed in China, which had previously sailed from Shanghai to Hankou, was ordered to return to Shanghai and entered the port at 11:55 AM yesterday morning. Together with the flagship of the Third Fleet "Izumo" and the destroyer "Ren" that arrived in Shanghai the day before, there are now three Japanese warships in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Civil Associations Announce Calm Response</p>
<p>The heads of the citizens' associations in the Hongkou district believe that the Hongkou urban area has been affected by the current situation in recent years, and the economy has already been severely impacted. If another incident were to occur, the future would be even more unimaginable. They were deeply concerned and held an emergency meeting yesterday morning to decide to issue an announcement to the citizens in the district, urging them to respond calmly and not to panic. The announcement is recorded as follows: "It has been learned that the Japanese Marine Corps dispatched a large number of troops last night under the pretext of a missing soldier, conducting inspections and patrols. After negotiations with the Municipal Government, the situation has eased. It is hoped that the citizens in the district will respond calmly and not panic. It must be known that in today's world, there is no distinction between the front and the rear, and there is no such thing as safety. Sacrifice is no longer sufficient to save the country. It is hoped that everyone will maintain their livelihoods and maintain the market as a priority."</p>
<p>Japanese School Builds Observation Tower</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the Japanese High School on North Sichuan Road, established by the Japanese Residents' Association, was suddenly guarded by three Japanese Marine Corps soldiers yesterday morning. A small new building was being rushed to completion on the roof of the school yesterday. Judging from its shape, it appears to be an observation tower.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Scout, Escort Back to Camp</p>
<p>At around 7:00 PM last night, a Japanese Marine Corps squad leader, Nakayama Mizuide, accompanied by a soldier, sneaked into the area of the Sun Temple in Zhabei to scout. The security team, fearing an accident, escorted the squad leader and his soldier to the Beizhan Branch. The head of the branch, Liang, personally escorted them to the Japanese headquarters. The Japanese headquarters expressed sincere gratitude to Director Liang for his prudent handling of the matter.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Subcommittee Approves Existing Mezzanine Floors to Remain</h3>
<p>However, Mezzanines in Small Factories Should be Removed - New Ones Can Apply for Permits</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of mezzanine floors built in all Chinese-style houses in the Public Concession, the Municipal Council was petitioned by a Western taxpayer at last year's annual meeting to investigate the current situation, as the construction of mezzanine floors by Chinese citizens hindered fire safety and hygiene. They proposed that the original 80,000+ mezzanine floors be completely demolished. Subsequently, the Council organized various subcommittees to improve housing in the Concession. After a lengthy period of investigation and research, they appointed Chinese members Xi Yuhua, Jiang Yiping, and Jin Jun, the British general manager of a foreign firm, to study the report of the Housing Investigation Committee and decide on the demolition issue. According to the reporter of the East China News Agency, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>All Directors Agree Not to Demolish</p>
<p>Directors Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Jin Jun concluded that the mezzanine floor case in the Public Concession was still an economic issue. Mezzanine floors have existed since the establishment of the Concession. Although there are many vacant houses at present, it has not affected the residents of the mezzanine floors. If all 80,000+ mezzanine floors in the entire area were to be completely demolished, it would not only affect the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of coolie residents, but also result in a loss of material resources of at least three million yuan. At the same time, fires often occur in the Public Concession, and according to statistical research, they are not caused by mezzanine floor residents. In terms of hygiene, mezzanine floor residents are not only very cautious but also pay great attention to morality, because they live and rest in the three-foot mezzanine floor. If there is any uncleanness, it will affect them first. Furthermore, if the mezzanine floors were to be demolished, the industry and commerce in the Public Concession would be destroyed. Therefore, it is advocated that before the Municipal Council builds a large number of public housing units in the Concession, the relevant economic and safe mezzanine floors should only be encouraged to administer and improve, and cautioned at any time to pay attention to fire prevention and hygiene, except for those that are absolutely necessary. However, it should not be demolished. After being submitted to the entire board of directors for discussion, it was unanimously agreed that mezzanine floors should be allowed to continue to exist in their current state without being demolished. It was reported that when the Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Guo Shun, Yuan Ludeng, and Xi Jiang attended, they also explained in detail the plight of the mezzanine floors in terms of economic, industrial, commercial, and social conditions, which finally garnered the sympathy of the foreign directors.</p>
<p>All Original Mezzanine Floors Remain the Same</p>
<p>After more than a year of entanglement, the mezzanine floor issue has finally come to an end. According to the reporter, except for the mezzanine floors in small factories (i.e., those built in factory sites in the alleys that affect the safety of the entire alley), which must be demolished, the remaining residential mezzanine floors can remain the same.</p>
<p>New Mezzanine Floors Can Obtain Licenses</p>
<p>According to the research results of the subcommittee, under the current circumstances, in addition to the existing mezzanine floors in the Public Concession that can remain as they are, citizens can also be allowed to build new mezzanine floors in the Public Concession, given the population density, so that the poor can have a place to live. After the reason was submitted to the board of directors, it was also approved. If new mezzanine floors are to be built, a license can be obtained from the Public Works Department. However, the following points must be noted when starting construction: ㊀ The issue of egress in case of fire must be considered. ㊁ The distance between the upper mezzanine floor and the roof must be eight feet. ㊂ The distance between the lower mezzanine floor and the ground must be at least seven feet, and its area must not exceed half of the floor area of the house.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Prominent Figures</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, has returned to Shanghai from Lu after completing his public affairs in the north. It was learned yesterday that Wu has decided to leave Shanghai tomorrow on the Changxing Company's Japanese Empress to return to Guangdong to oversee affairs.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi</p>
<p>Central Committee members Chu Minyi, Wang Faqin, Mei Chuanxiong, and others left Beijing by night train at 11:00 PM the night before last (the 24th) and arrived here at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. Chu then took the night train back to Beijing yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Huang Bode</p>
<p>Huang Bode, Secretary of the Embassy in Japan, went to Beijing the day before yesterday to meet with the authorities and report on important matters. After completing his duties, he returned to Huan by night train last night and is scheduled to take the Coolidge to Japan tonight with Lin Xiaogu, a translator from the embassy.</p>
<h3>Guibi Composition Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>One Legal Tender Dollar Exchanges for One Dollar and Eighty Cents - Central Bank Guizhou Branch to be Established This Year</p>
<p>The issue of reorganizing the Guizhou monetary system, after Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Economic Council, went to Guizhou to confer with Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and others, has now been further negotiated on specific details. According to the reporter of the East China News Agency, the current proposal is to set one legal tender dollar equal to one Guizhou dollar and eighty cents, including settlement. The Guizhou branch of the Central Bank can be established within this year.</p>
<h3>Xu Yiqiao, Who Studied Social Education in Europe, Returned to China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xu Yiqiao, a section chief of the Ministry of Education and editor of the China New Theory Society, went to various European countries last October to study social education and youth training. He traveled to England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and other countries. He has now completed his research and arrived in Shanghai at 6:00 AM yesterday morning on the British ship "Rajputana". Those who came to welcome him included Lei Zhen, director of the Ministry of Education, Secretary Huang Longxian, Section Chief Yu Dehui, as well as Cai Shuhou, Wu Cheng, Gan Fuchu, Luo Hongzhao, Zhang Jinyou, and dozens of others. At 7:00 PM, Lei Zhen hosted a welcoming banquet at the New Asia Hotel. It is said that Xu plans to rest in Shanghai for a while before heading to Beijing to report everything to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Coal and Rice Merchants Prevent Enemy Support by Traitorous Merchants</h3>
<p>Coal Merchants to Hold Meeting in Coming Days to Discuss - Rice Prices Stable, Ample Inventory</p>
<p>Coal Industry</p>
<p>The National Coal Production and Sales Association of this city is deeply saddened that, during this tense period, unscrupulous merchants have gone mad and provided coal to the enemy. Furthermore, most of the coal used in this city is transported from North China. Now that North China is under pressure, transportation is bound to be affected. Once freight transport is disrupted, Shanghai may face a shortage. Moreover, the current inventory in the city is not large. In addition to contacting major coal mining companies for assistance, all coal merchants have been notified to supervise each other to prevent traitors from taking advantage of the opportunity. The Coal Industry Association of this city, in addition to offering material condolences to the industry, will convene a joint meeting of all executives and supervisors in the coming days to discuss strict measures to prevent the industry from providing coal to the enemy and how to alleviate coal shortages when freight transport is disrupted.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants</p>
<p>Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the rice merchants in this city have decided to strictly prevent traitorous merchants from transporting grain to support the enemy. Therefore, rice shops in both the north and south markets have unanimously refused to handle goods for customer groups from Qinhuangdao, Dalian, Yingkou, and Andong. The industry is taking a mutually supervised attitude, which is still united and determined. At the same time, rice prices in this city have recently become stable. According to an accurate investigation, the amount of rice stored in the warehouses includes Shuntai, Mitsubishi, Taikoo, China Merchants, Huazhan, Qichang, Yitaixing, Fuxin, Osaka, China, Continental, Four Lines, Xingye, Shiye, Jiangsu, and Zikang, etc. Sixteen companies have a total of 478,000+ bags. The amount of rice sold downstream in the north and south markets is about 1,000 shi (a unit of dry measure). Therefore, the total amount of rice stored in this city is estimated to be 480,000 bags.</p>
<h3>The Reporter's Inspection This Morning</h3>
<p>Baoshan Road Area is Quiet as Usual - Japanese Plainclothes Squads Still Very Active</p>
<p>After 3:00 AM this morning, the reporter revisited the Zhabei area. Compared with the night before and yesterday morning, the situation was significantly calmer. Doushan Road and Xibaoxing Road have returned to the state before 9:00 PM the night before last. However, Japanese Marine Corps soldiers were still scattered near all the bridges along the Yokohama River. Although the number could not be ascertained, it is estimated to be around 200 or more. The Japanese plainclothes squads were very active in various places along the river, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Sometimes, clapping sounds could be heard from across the bank. The distance between the Japanese Marine Corps sentries and each bridgehead was about 200 to 300 meters.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss the Situation in North China</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan Telegrams Central Government Report - States He Did Not Accept Humiliating Conditions</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, accompanied by legislator Chuan Bingchang, took the 11:00 PM express train from Beijing the night before last and arrived at the Zhenru station at 6:50 AM yesterday morning. He then returned to his residence on Columbia Road to rest. At his residence, Sun met with reporters from various newspapers. He was extremely concerned about the situation in Shanghai and first inquired about the facts of the actions of the Japanese Marine Corps the night before. Then he talked about the situation in North China. According to him, there were various rumors about the withdrawal of troops, but Song Zheyuan's report to the Central Government stated that he had not accepted any humiliating compromise conditions. However, the ambition of the Japanese is insatiable, and although the situation has eased for the time being, its severity has not diminished. The government, while striving for peace, must adhere to the minimum of the four points put forward by Chairman Chiang at the Lushan Conference. His trip to Guangdong is still undecided, as he must wait and see the evolution of the situation.</p>

<p>The Selangor Overseas Chinese Charity Troupe, for the purpose of relieving disaster areas, specially raised funds of more than 2,000 yuan and remitted them by airmail to the United Relief Association of various charitable organizations in this city yesterday.

Thanks to the enthusiastic donations from all sectors of the local overseas Chinese community, the total amount raised was 1,097.50 Straits dollars, equivalent to 2,146.70 national currency.

It is hoped that you will distribute it to the disaster areas to save the disaster victims, so that the suffering compatriots can survive and regain their lives, which will be the merit and grace of your association.

<h3>Request to Lift the Ban on Silkworm Cocoon Exports: Silk Industry Groups Petition This Morning</h3>
<p>Cocoon Prices Soar, Silk Factories Unable to Reel Silk</p>
<p>Silk reeling factories in this city, recently due to the Jiangxi and Hunan Provincial Silk Control Committees' ban on the export of dried cocoons, face a cutoff of raw material supply, threatening a complete shutdown. Over 30,000 workers are in danger of losing their livelihoods. Therefore, labor and management groups have repeatedly met to discuss the issue and have appealed to both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, as well as the Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committees, requesting the lifting of the ban to maintain operations. Now, to seek assistance from the municipal party and government authorities, the trade association has appointed Shen Huachen, Zhang Peishen, Xu Peixiong, Tang Yeqin, Chen Xiupu of the Fourth District Silk Reeling Workers' Union, Yuan Yunlong of the Sixth District Silk Reeling Workers' Union, Yang Gengti, Liu Sanbao, and others as representatives to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau this morning. They request that their appeal be forwarded to the central government and that the governments of Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces be consulted to revoke the ban and allow transportation, so as to safeguard the livelihoods of over 30,000 workers. According to sources in the silk industry, the dry cocoons owned by silk factories in Shanghai are now exhausted. The stocks in silk warehouses are all leftover cocoons. Recently, due to the cutoff of supply, the market has been monopolized, and prices have been raised, so silk factories cannot purchase cocoons for reeling. Of the 44 thread factories currently operating in this city, in addition to the Yuan Lü and He Tai factories, which have already been forced to shut down, other factories such as Qin Yi, Fuxing, Jincheng, Yifeng, and Xinchang will soon follow suit. At most, all manufacturers will be shut down within a month. Therefore, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers are of great concern.</p>

<h3>Cotton Company Sends Personnel to Inspect Cotton-Producing Areas</h3>
<p>Gao Li Guangzhou Branch Company</p>
<p>Since expanding its business, the China Cotton Industry Company has been actively carrying out both internal and external work. Because cotton in various places is about to mature, the company has specially dispatched Manager Wu Weijing to inspect various places in order to understand the cotton production situation in various places. It is learned that Mr. Wu took a train to Zhengzhou and Jinan and other places a few days ago. Once the inspection is completed, he will report to Shanghai immediately. In addition, the company believes that Guangzhou is also a cotton-producing area, so it has specially established a branch company there to facilitate collection.</p>
<h3>Ministry of People's Training Explains Voting Rights of Organizations</h3>
<p>Official Letter Sent to the Municipal Party Headquarters for Verification Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city received a notice from the Ministry of People's Training of the Central Government yesterday, explaining the issue of voting rights when mass organizations hold meetings. The original text is as follows: "The New Life Movement Headquarters has sent a letter regarding the voting rights of proxies when mass organizations hold meetings, and whether the quorum is related to the number of proxies (if each proxy accounts for two-thirds, are the resolutions passed legal?). It is not known whether your ministry has any regulations on this matter. If so, please provide a copy of the materials for reference and a response." Having approved this, it is found that there are no explicit regulations on this point in the various laws and regulations formulated by this ministry. According to the Civil Code, the legal acts of proxies (except for specific ones) are considered valid. Therefore, legal proxies attending mass organization meetings should have voting rights. Furthermore, the quorum should have no relationship with the number of legal representatives attending. That is, if legal proxies account for two-thirds, the resolutions passed are still legal. However, in order to be cautious about important proposals of various mass organizations, if proxies accounting for one-third of the total number express in writing within ten days after the resolution of a certain proposal that the proxy's attendance violates the intent of the authorization and make a proposal and vote, the proposal should be reconsidered. In addition to replying by letter and sending letters to various departments, a corresponding letter is hereby delivered in the hope that you will check it for compliance.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Association Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussion of Loan Proposal Not Concluded</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association held its 44th executive committee meeting of the third session at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Ningbo Road Association Hall. After reporting the minutes of the previous meeting and various reports on the reserve fund, the following was discussed: (1) The Municipal National Products Promotion Association sent a letter stating that it is not appropriate to tighten loans by silver and money industries during the serious national crisis. After the committee members expressed their opinions separately, they all believed that whether or not each money shop tightens loans is purely a voluntary action of each business day, entirely depending on the economic capacity of each. This association can hardly impose mandatory regulations. Moreover, the situation is tense, and it is difficult to find anyone tightening loans, but there are also many who are operating as usual or expanding loans. This association shares the same desire to support industry and commerce in order to coexist and prosper. As a result of the discussion, no decision was made on this issue. Subsequently, many routine cases were resolved before adjourning at around 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Distributes Epidemic Medicines to Various Prisons</h3>

It has already informed the wardens of each prison by letter to send personnel to the association to collect them in order to relieve sick prisoners in prison.</p>
<h3>Postal Knowledge Q &amp; A (33)</h3>
<p>(Question) Our store is a bookstore and publishes many books. I read in the 28th issue of your Q&amp;A that the post office has a method for ordering books on behalf of people, and the post office has a catalog of books that can be ordered on behalf of people for anyone to read. I don’t know whether the books entered in this catalog are obtained by the post office through its own investigation or through other procedures (i.e., such as an application from the issuing bookstore or the author to the post office) before they are entered. Please let me know so that the books published by our store can also be included in the list of books that the post office can order on behalf of people.</p>
<p>(Answer) It is applied for by the publisher. The procedures are as follows: The post office divides the books that can be ordered on behalf of people into twenty categories, namely: 1. General category, such as catalogs, series, classics, philosophers, etc.; 2. Philosophy and religion; 3. History, biography, geography, travel notes, anthropology; 4. Sociology; 5. Transportation and commerce; 6. Economics; 7. Politics; 8. Law; 9. Education; 10. Music and fine arts; 11. Literature; 12. Natural science; 13. Astronomy and mathematics; 14. Physics and chemistry; 15. Geology and biology; 16. Medicine and hygiene; 17. Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry; 18. Engineering and technology; 15. Military science; 20. Domestic science and entertainment. For the above types of books, if they are published in a place with a post office and have not been prohibited from postal delivery in the year, the publisher can fill out an application form and pay a registration fee of one national currency unit per book to the postal administration to which the place of publication belongs. The application form should be written in regular script in duplicate, stating: 1. Category of book; 2. Title of book; 3. Name of author or translator. If it is a translation, please also include the name of the original author; 4. Name of publisher; 5. Name of publishing house; 6. Address of publishing house; 7. Date of publication and edition; 8. Version; 9. Binding style; 10. Number of volumes; 11. Postage and weight (the so-called postage and weight refers to the gross weight of one book including a suitable wrapping and the postage it should collect. This weight is calculated in grams. If the publisher voluntarily waives the postage, it can be noted with the words "Postage waived" and the weight does not need to be filled in); 12. Actual selling price (i.e., the actual retail price of the store); 13. A brief description of no more than fifty words, or a table of contents; 14. If it is an ancient edition or other books that cannot be ordered by most people at any time, a special statement should also be made. In addition, the publisher should provide another letter stating that the books for which registration is requested are willing to pay handling fees in accordance with the regulations of the post office for ordering books on behalf of people or set a minimum wholesale price and state that the books meet the conditions for the post office to be allowed to order on behalf of people. After receiving this application form and letter, the postal administration will submit it to the Directorate General of Posts after checking that it is correct and incorporate the registered books into the catalog issued quarterly in accordance with the regulations, and distribute it to post offices in various places for display and sales, so that the public can know. A copy of the catalog will be sent to the publisher as proof that it has been registered.</p>

<h3>Young Son of British Knight Arrested for Theft in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Immersed in Cabarets and Dance Halls, Empty Pockets and Exhausted Money - Repeatedly Stole Typewriters, Calculating Machines, etc. - Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison, Suspended for Two Years</p>
<p>He Yongyi, a young man from Guangdong, 25 years old, whose father, He Kai (a transliteration of the English Ho.Kia), has resided in Hong Kong for a long time. Because he has contributed to the British government, he has been awarded the title of Knight, and his entire family has also been naturalized as British citizens. Everyone in Hong Kong and Guangdong knows Sir He Kai. He has more than ten children, one of whom is married to the late national government figure Wu Chaoshu. He Yongyi is the youngest son, so his parents dote on him deeply, allowing him to wander freely and do whatever he wants. His daily needs are all supplied by his mother. Recently, he suddenly came to Shanghai and lived at No. 9, Lane 697, Edward Road. He spends all day immersed in cabarets and dance halls, leading to financial difficulties. In addition, he suffers from illness. Although his brothers, He Yongqian, etc., have high-ranking jobs in Shanghai, they all despise their brother's usual behavior, so He Yongyi has no face to ask his brothers for help, and he has resorted to theft. On June 18th, he went to Room 523 of the HSBC building and stole a typewriter worth 100 yuan. On June 30th, he went to Room 407, No. 2 Beijing Road, and stole miscellaneous items worth 169 yuan, spending the money. On July 10th, he went to No. 181 Nanjing Road, the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and stole a calculating machine worth 1,600 yuan. He was just about to escape with the stolen goods when he was seen by the company's clerk and immediately arrested. He was taken to the General Police Station. Because He was a British citizen, he was sent to the British Consulate for interrogation. However, the British Consulate acknowledged that his entire family was British citizens but denied that He Yongyi was a British citizen. Therefore, the police station escorted him to the First Special Court Criminal Division yesterday. Ru Baoyi, the police station's lawyer, explained the defendant's crimes and stated that after the incident, his brother contacted the plaintiffs and reached an agreement. They all requested that the court not pursue the matter. However, the police station believed that the defendant's crime was undoubtedly true, so they still filed a lawsuit with the court, but requested that a suspended sentence be granted at the time of judgment so that he could reform himself. When questioned, He Yongyi admitted to the continuous theft. Then his brother, He Yongqian, turned himself in, requesting a lenient sentence so that he could take him back to Hong Kong, strictly discipline him, and hire Yang Sicheng and Ye Shaoying as lawyers to appear in court, requesting a suspended sentence in accordance with Article 74 of the Criminal Law. After verifying the confession, Judge Feng Shide announced the judgment in court. He Yongyi was sentenced to eight months in prison for continuous theft, suspended for two years, and handed over to his brother He Yongqian for supervision.</p>
<h3>Old Man Repeatedly Extorted Money, Conviction Pronounced After Interrogation</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months in Prison, Suspended for Three Years</p>
<p>On June 17th of this year, Gu Xiaofu from Chongming was killed in a jealous fight over a woman on Touba Road, Hongkou. The murderer escaped without a trace. On the 1st of this month, Shi Yongfu, an old man from Chongming (61 years old) residing at No. 38 Touba Road, was cooling off in the China Garden on Suzhou Road when he met Hu Shaojiang (a boatman) from the same hometown. He said, "You are related to the Gu Xiaofu murder case. The police station is issuing warrants for your arrest. If you want to clear your name, you must give me 25 yuan, and I can prevent it. The deceased is my godson, and I will not pursue the matter. Otherwise, you will definitely be included as an accomplice." Hu Shaojiang was afraid that he would be framed and was extremely frightened. He raised 15 yuan on the 3rd and gave it to his home to avoid being identified as one of the murderers. Unexpectedly, after receiving the money, Shi Yongfu met Hu again on the road the day before yesterday and said, "You must give me another 10 yuan to settle the matter. Walking around Touba Road in Hongkou, I guarantee you will be safe." He was invited to Tianxing Laohuzao at No. 217 Tiantong Road to pay the remaining amount. Hu then realized that he was extorting money under false pretenses and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. Detective Tang Guangfu was dispatched and marked a 10-yuan Chinese farmer banknote in secret and went to deliver it at the appointed time. After Shi Yongfu accepted it, he saw the detectives arrive and threw the banknote on the ground to escape, but was still arrested and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court Criminal Division III. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, explained the case and requested an investigation. Then, according to Hu Shaojiang's testimony, the defendant extorted money under false pretenses, defrauding him of 15 yuan, and was still not satisfied, so he reported it to the police station to arrest him. According to Detective Tang's report on the arrest of the defendant, he presented a 10-yuan banknote as evidence. When questioned, the defendant confessed, "The deceased Gu Xiaofu is my godson, and the plaintiff Hu Shaojiang both worshiped a 'Lao Tou Zi', so they are brothers from the same industry. That day, I knew that the murderer Wang Laolin invited him to drink, and the plaintiff was also present, so I scolded him and slapped him twice. I did not receive 15 yuan." The remaining testimony was denied. Judge Xiao Xie fen sentenced Shi Yongfu to six months in prison, suspended for three years.</p>
<h3>Case of Person from Guan Nong Injuring Store Owner's Wife</h3>
<p>Private Lawsuit Settled Through Mediation; Public Lawsuit Resulted in Fine of One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Lu Zhou, the Suzhou wife of the owner of the Yuanxing Fruit Shop at No. 298 Fada Road, was attacked a few days ago by Ouyang Qinghua, a person from Ningbo from Guan Nong in Jianli, behind the shop. In anger, he rushed into the shop from the back door with a knife and slashed her head, arms, and other places four times. The shop assistants subdued the assailant and called the police for arrest. The police sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment and escorted the assailant to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention, awaiting the victim's recovery for further interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is learned that the cause of the incident was that the Yuanxing Fruit Shop has been prosperous in recent years, with crowded goods and a cramped shop. There is no place to store them. There is a vacant house at No. 4 in Jianli, behind the shop, which is owned by the Catholic Church. Lu Zhou, the wife of the owner of the Yuanxing Fruit Shop, discussed the matter with Ouyang Qinghua from Guan Nong in Jianli, asking to temporarily borrow it to store goods. If someone comes to rent it, they can move out at any time. Ouyang replied that the authority rested with the landlord's agent, the Zhou family who collected the rent, and they should contact the Zhou family. Ms. Lu then entrusted Ouyang to discuss the matter with the Zhou family, who agreed to temporarily lend the vacant house No. 4 to Yuanxing to store goods, and Yuanxing would send a monthly remuneration. For several months, they lived in peace. Unexpectedly, the main landlord, the Catholic Church, learned of this recently and investigated the Guan Nong people for privately lending out the vacant house for profit. Ouyang immediately notified Yuanxing to quickly move out the stored goods, but Yuanxing requested a postponement because it was impossible to move so many goods at once, causing a conflict. Later, Ouyang was unable to reply to the landlord, and in anger, he slashed Yuanxing's wife, Lu Zhou, with a knife to vent his anger. Now, in the private lawsuit, the assailant Ouyang's family has asked people to earnestly discuss a settlement with Lu Zhou, paying compensation for medical expenses and losses, and publishing an apology in the newspaper. In the public lawsuit, Lawyer Jin of the police force filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court on the charge of injury. After the trial, the verdict was announced the day before yesterday that Ouyang Qinghua injured a person and was fined 100 yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Reaches Japan, Huangpu River High Tide</h3>
<p>Temperature at Ninety-Four Point Six Degrees, Oppressive Heat</p>
<p>The Pacific hurricane landed on Kyushu Island in Japan yesterday. At the same time, the temperature in this city rose again, and the Huangpu River experienced another high tide. The situation is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Hurricane Reaches Japan</p>
<p>The hurricane originating near Guam Island in the Pacific Ocean initially headed northwest, causing the southeastern coast of China to be in danger of being hit for a time. Then it suddenly turned due north, showing a tendency to approach the Ryukyu Islands. This was not the case, and the wind direction turned north-northeast and continued to advance in this direction without changing. It finally reached 22 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM yesterday. Checking its position, it has landed on Kyushu Island in Japan.</p>
<p>Oppressive Heat</p>
<p>Although the hurricane landed on Kyushu Island, it is not known whether the landing site is a prosperous or remote area, so it is impossible to guess whether there will be any impact. However, since the hurricane has landed, its force will naturally weaken, and it will soon disappear, needless to say. According to the astronomical observatory, the highest temperature in this city before 3:00 PM yesterday was 94.6 degrees, and the heat wave once again invaded Shanghai, making it extremely oppressive.</p>
<p>Sudden High Tide</p>
<p>Also, around 3:00 PM yesterday, a sudden high tide occurred in the Huangpu River and then receded. The Huangpu Bureau predicted a figure of 10 feet and 5 inches, causing the New-New Company side on Guangxi Road, the China Business Company on Sichuan Road, and the Jin Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road to experience backflow from the sewers, causing waterlogging. However, yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and the Huangpu Bureau was not working, so the actual amount could not be recorded. It is estimated that it must have been above 12 feet.</p>
<h3>American Female Teacher Causes Traffic Accident</h3>
<p>Boy Xu Binggen Injured in Collision - Rescue Ineffective, Died on Morning Prior</p>

When she was 50 yards east of Muer Duck Road, she suddenly knocked down a boy, Xu Binggen (7 years old, from Changshu), who was walking on the road, causing serious injuries. The woman sent the child to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment. The Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified and ordered detectives to investigate. The child's condition deteriorated at 12:20 AM on the previous morning. Rescue was ineffective, and he died. The body was taken to the Feilun Road autopsy station. Tang, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special Court, arrived at the station yesterday morning to examine the body. After confirming the identity of the family, he instructed the father, Xu Furong, to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Paper Shop Owner Forges New-New Amusement Tickets</h3>
<p>Fellow Distributors Sue for Compensation - Over Two Hundred Ninety Yuan in National Currency</p>

The main points of the lawsuit stated that the defendant, Shou Kangzhi, operated the Dafengchang Cigarette Paper Shop and distributed tickets for the New-New Company rooftop garden. Last month, the defendant ordered his employees Shen and Chen to sell 4,687 of the above tickets to the plaintiffs for sale at their stores. They immediately paid 290 yuan and 57 cents in national currency. It was only later discovered that these tickets were all forged. After the plaintiffs reported this to the police, the defendant was arrested, but no public prosecution was filed. The defendant's actions constitute crimes under Articles 203 and 339 of the Criminal Code. In addition to requesting that the defendant be summoned for punishment in accordance with the law, they also request a judgment ordering the defendant to compensate for damages of 290 yuan and 57 cents in national currency. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai presided over the hearing in Criminal Division II, and the defendant hired lawyer Sun Zuji to appear in court to defend him. After the interrogation was completed, the court scheduled a date for announcing the verdict on the morning of the 28th.</p>
<h3>Murderer of Adulterous Couple Turns Himself In and Confesses</h3>

<h3>American Woman, Smith, Captures a White Bear in Sichuan</h3>
<p>The white bear is a specialty of northwestern Sichuan Province. Ms. Smith is waiting for a price to sell it to a museum.</p>
<p>Recently, the French ship "Andre Huang Peng" sailed from Shanghai to Marseille. Among the passengers was an American woman named Smith, who was carrying a white bear and several other birds and animals. This white bear is a specialty of northwestern Sichuan Province and can only be found in bamboo forests, because this animal only eats bamboo. Therefore, it is very rare and precious. Last year, Mrs. Harkness acquired a small bear in Sichuan that was only a few months old. Later, in winter, she shipped it from Shanghai to New York and sold it to a museum for a huge price. This time, Ms. Smith captured one male and one female. The male weighed 300 pounds and died of illness on the way down the Yangtze River. The existing female weighs 200 pounds. After Ms. Smith arrived in Shanghai, she kept it a secret to avoid the trouble of people in Shanghai asking to see it. Although this animal usually eats bamboo, Ms. Smith has discovered that it also eats noodles, candies, and sugarcane, so there is no need to worry about food. As for after arriving in Marseille, she will either sell it to the British Museum or ship it to the United States for sale, which has not yet been determined. The price she can get is also yet to be decided. Ms. Smith plans to exhibit it in England before selling it, expecting to charge each visitor one shilling. If exhibited in the United States, she can charge each visitor 25 cents. The admission fees collected should be more than the selling price of the animal, it is said. Ms. Smith plans to return to China in the autumn of this year and go to Sichuan again to capture animals. Ms. Smith has lived in Sichuan for many years and has a lot of experience in capturing bears, so she will definitely be able to continue to capture more in the future.</p>

<h3>Yu Hede Cables to Request Payment of the Former Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Debts</h3>
<p>Losses Suffered When the Railway Was Nationalized - The Method of Repayment Should Be Revised</p>
<p>Former Zhejiang Railway representative Yu Hede, at the request of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Debt Group representative, telegraphed to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan yesterday, (title omitted) The current Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway was founded by the former Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Company. During the commercial operation period, the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou section and the Ningbo-Cao'e River section in Shaoxing had been opened to traffic. In the second year of the Republic of China, the northern government, disregarding the efforts of the merchants, nationalized the railway. All company shares were exchanged for securities, along with the original bonds issued by the Zhejiang Railway Company, to be repaid in installments. Apart from what has already been repaid, there are still outstanding principal and interest due in the final period, as well as unpaid amounts occupied by the Zhejiang Railway Company, totaling more than 1.58 million yuan. It was originally scheduled to be fully repaid by October of the seventh year of the Republic of China, but it was not paid by the due date and was delayed for as long as eighteen years. It was not until October of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, when the Ministry of Railways negotiated a loan with a banking syndicate to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, that discussions began on repayment. By May of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, when the banking syndicate loan was established, the ministry only allocated 800,000 yuan, which was handed over to the liquidation office of the two railways for proportional distribution according to the share capital and debt amounts. According to the calculation, the amount received was only half of the debt amount. The bondholders repeatedly argued with the ministry, but there was no result. When the railway was nationalized, Hede was the representative of the Zhejiang Railway and was well aware of the significant losses suffered by the merchants. Now, the repayment method set by the ministry saves very little for the government but causes significant losses for the merchants. For the sake of maintaining national credibility and alleviating the hardships of the people, it is necessary for the ministry to revise the repayment method. Now, according to the representatives of the debt group, they repeatedly request that justice be upheld. Hede, as it concerns his hometown, cannot shirk his responsibility. In addition to previously telegraphing to the ministry to make an appeal on their behalf, the representatives of the debt group have also submitted a detailed statement of reasons to the Executive Yuan and the ministry. I would like to implore Your Excellency to consider the merchants' initial efforts and the railway's prosperous operation. The small amount of several hundred thousand yuan is not difficult to raise. Please approve the Ministry of Railways to revise the repayment method so that all bondholders can be fully compensated, thereby upholding national credibility and alleviating the hardships of the merchants. Is this appropriate? I respectfully await your decision. Yu Hede respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Person Wounded Escapes from Hospital and Dies - Head Nurse and Others Summoned for Questioning</h3>
<p>Doctor on Duty at the Hospital - Released on Bail of 500 Yuan</p>
<p>A guest named Hu Jinfu, over fifty years old, was slashed in the head in five places on Kangheng Road in southern Shanghai a few days ago. He was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment by the West Gate Branch. Unexpectedly, Hu Jinfu died the day after arriving at the hospital in the Fengji Wharf area. Qin Defang, a local official from the 23rd district, reported to the local court, and Inspector He Jingcen declared that the death was due to injuries and filled out the household form, and a coffin was provided for burial. However, according to a report from Zhu Gonghong, the director of Shanghai Hospital, after the deceased arrived at the hospital, he refused to explain the cause of the attack and did not want to be treated in the hospital, escaping on his own, leading to his death. However, the West Gate Branch believes that when a person is dying, they will seek help to survive and would never willingly give up their life. They sent a medical investigator to investigate. According to reports, Shanghai Hospital requires all patients to pay ten yuan upon admission, as well as other miscellaneous fees, before they can receive treatment. Otherwise, they are refused. The deceased was turned away because he had no money and was then claimed to have escaped. The matter was reported to the General Bureau, which forwarded it to the inspector. If this is true, the hospital's lack of morality and disregard for human life make them indirectly responsible for the death. To determine whether this is the case, Inspector He specially ordered Chen Yongan, the head nurse of the hospital, the doctor on duty at the time, police officers from the West Gate Branch, and Qin Defang, a local official from the 23rd district, to appear in court for questioning yesterday (the 24th). It is rumored that the doctor paid a bail of 500 yuan pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>"What Do I Do?"</h3>
<p>— Ge Chonglou</p>
<p>'The enemy wants to keep his plundered loot—the four northeastern provinces—and he also wants to send troops to North China to attack our abdomen; and we must not only defend North China, expel the enemy from the border of Hebei and Chahar, but also recover our lost territories in the four northeastern provinces; so this means fighting to the death, and it can be said that survival is at stake. However, the enemy is doing his best to plot against us, and we are doing our best to resist the enemy, so the victory or defeat of this war cannot be judged in a short time; in this period when the great war is opening, we must decide what responsibilities we should bear.</p>
<p>Excitement, shouts, arguments... these are all useless, we should all ask ourselves: 'What do I do?' Destroying one's family to relieve the country's difficulties is of course the most enthusiastic expression; however, small forces should not be despised, such as the work of sharpening a large knife, be sure to do our best, choose strengths to contribute, so that power is not wasted, and anti-warfare is truly beneficial, and then we can hope for the final victory.</p>
<p>In short: except for traitors, everyone must do their best and stay out of the matter! (Transfer remuneration to national defense donations)</p>

<h3>Young Woman Feng Wanzhen</h3>
<p>— Ru Hui</p>
<p>In the vicinity of Beiping. Less than ten li from the Summer Palace, is the Xie Village region. Seen from here, one can vaguely make out the ancient city of Beiping, a black and沉沉 unfolding on the skyline. The village’s perimeter still has some trees, in the yellow, sandy north, such a village boasts worthy scenery.</p>
<p>One day at dusk, Xie Village residents from afar witnessed flames rising from Beiping city, along with barely audible cannon fire. The next morning, people seeking refuge in the countryside reported: “The Summer Palace was burned by foreign devils, the Wen Zong Emperor escaped to Rehe, several places in the capital city were also attacked by gunfire…”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the village’s people realized that trouble had erupted. A husky man dressed like a hunter even more so, was filled with anger; he turned to that strange man and asked:</p>
<p>“What about the officers? Aren’t they moving to kill the devil soldiers?”</p>
<p>The traveler from the capital city turned his head, “Officers?” He let out a grunt from his nostrils. Afterwards, with a very grief-stricken attitude, he stated: “They only help the foreign devils to rob the common people, the foreign devils rob on the east, they rob on the west, the foreign devils rob on the west, they rob on the east!”</p>
<p>“These officers…” the husky man did not shout out “scoundrel.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t very officer-like.” The guest finished harshly, and picked up a load of sundries along with his family and left.</p>
<p>“Brother Sanbao, we must also defend ourselves.” A young man said.</p>
<p>The husky man nodded. He was actually the village chief of this village, named Feng, and called Sanbao. His ancestors were from Shandong, and his burly frame revealed the valor and strength of northerners. Under his leadership, the people of this village survived by hunting.</p>
<p>One day passed, and as expected several dozen western soldiers seeking to desert secretly approached Xie Village, Sanbao impolitely led all of the village’s hunters and bravely resisted the enemy, in contact akin to a skirmish. The villagers relied on the village for cover. Although only several dozen hunting rifles, they still repelled the western soldiers, and even killed several of them from a distance. This small victory greatly excited everyone. The entire village was filled with lively and happy air. That night, a feast was laid out at Sanbao’s home, Sanbao’s face was full of smiles, and he engaged in impassioned discussions with the village comrades who had participated in the battle. They said: “If the officers in the capital city also had this kind of ability, the emperor wouldn’t need to go to Rehe.”</p>
<p>At this lively banquet, only Sanbao’s daughter Wanzhen sat alone, cheerless with knitted brows. She sat beside her father, neither drinking nor conversing.</p>
<p>“Wanzhen, you are sitting there blankly, is something bothering you?” Finally, her father opened his mouth and asked. Everyone also turned their astonished gazes to her.</p>
<p>“Father,” Wanzhen said worriedly: “Now it seems that we have won, but if a small enemy leaves, a large enemy may arrive soon.”</p>
<p>“But we still have guns and bullets…” a young hunter said unconcernedly.</p>
<p>“However,” she continued: “If the western soldiers use cannons to bombard us, won’t this Xie Village instantly turn to ashes? How can I not be anxious?”</p>
<p>“Ah! Cannons?” Everyone froze as if struck by lightning, the wine cups they were holding, the chopsticks they were gripping, remained suspended in the air, and they stared wide-eyed at each other. The brave men present were clearly startled by the premonition of Xie Village’s painful end as “flying ash.” The dark shadow of the cannons pressed down on everyone at the table, making it hard to breathe; after a considerable silence, Sanbao stammered and opened his mouth:</p>
<p>“Wanzhen’s words, sound like they aren’t nonsense, everyone should think of a way. Everyone…”</p>
<p>Everyone’s throats went dry, and they quietly looked at each other. Sanbao, as cautiously as searching for wild game, carefully scrutinized each guest’s face for a while. His eyes, filled with disappointment, finally landed on Wanzhen, but she opened her mouth composedly:</p>
<p>“Father, elders, I have heard that western soldiers are skilled in fighting with firearms, but are unaccustomed to martial arts. The advantage of firearms is long-range attacks, the advantage of martial arts is close combat. Let’s use our strength in martial arts to attack their weakness in firearms, relying on fortune, perhaps we can avoid this crisis – what do you all think?”</p>
<p>The hunters started to discuss in a flurry, some nodding, some shaking their heads, some debating the comparison between firearms and knives, some talking about their experiences with martial arts. Sanbao also thought for a while, but he felt that close combat was not an easy way to win: the thought of grappling face-to-face with foreign devils made his heart turn cold, so he was unwilling to listen to his daughter’s words, but he couldn’t think of a better way than his daughter’s.</p>
<p>Wanzhen left the banquet, sighing at Xie Village’s ill-fated fortune, but she resolved to save the entire village and protect her elderly father. That night, she summoned the village’s most skilled martial artists, and she said to them with慷慨激昂:</p>
<p>“Do you all know the danger our village is in? Do you all know the danger we ourselves are in? The smashing of the village is as precarious as a pile of eggs, and our demise is also like morning dew. Rather than sitting and waiting to die, it would be better to fight to the death with the enemy soldiers. Now I have decided to go and engage in close combat with the western soldiers, regardless of life or death. If you have the courage, please follow me!” She cast a firm gaze around at the young men and asked: “Who dares to go with me?”</p>
<p>The young men usually admired Wanzhen, and were also moved by her seriousness and courage, so they yelled out “Good!” with a thunderous sound.</p>
<p>The heroine said happily: “With us so enthusiastic, Xie Village will certainly be spared from劫难.”</p>
<p>After preparations were finalized, they were all dressed in black with white blades, the youth’s heroism stirred the heart of chivalry, a group of fifty-odd people, following Wanzhen quietly set out under the starlight. The hunter’s skill, was as swift as a monkey. Four 里 from the village was a dense wood, the lane in the wood was the path the western soldiers were sure to take, Wanzhen directed the youths to ambush on both sides of the lane, quietly waiting for the western soldiers to arrive.</p>
<p>Before long, a team of western soldiers came with cannons. They were just about to calmly arrange to fire the cannons. Suddenly, a deafening cry was heard, the ambushers jumped out from all sides, rushing straight at the enemy, at the fall of a hand and rise of a blade, several fell. The western soldiers were caught off guard, and for a moment lost the ability to resist, each of Xie Village’s youth embraced a resolve to kill the enemy, and they had also received martial arts training. They sent these pitiful western soldiers, capable of nothing more than disturbing each other, fleeing helter-skelter. Wanzhen was like a fierce tiger bursting into a flock of sheep, brandishing two knives, fighting with all her strength, unleashing her full abilities, all that the blade reached had their heads smashed and blood flowing.</p>
<p>In the midst of the chaotic battle, the western soldiers retreated in defeat. She again led the crowd in pursuit, so that they were unable to fire cannons. As dawn approached, only ten-odd enemy soldiers remained, abandoning their cannons and fleeing in a panic. This sharp lesson made the enemy soldiers dare not come again. Xie Village’s life and property was preserved in the hands of a nineteen-year-old young woman.</p>
<p>This is a story from the tenth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, when the Anglo-French Allied Forces captured Beijing. Today, reading about Feng Wanzhen’s defeat of the enemy, and feeling sorrow and indignation at the death of the main general buried in the pile of bayonets and gunpowder, seeking peace, is unbearable. We must not become accustomed to the old method of “defeating” [the enemy], and the old essays of “swearing to death.” Not to mention “retreating?” Author</p>
