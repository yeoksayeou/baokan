<h3>敵謀取得吳淞羅店聯絡我大軍戒備嚴陣以待</h3>
<p>一二日內將有劇烈戰事發生　吳淞一帶鎮日血戰敵未得逞　江灣閘北敵屢反攻均遭擊退</p>
<p>截至今晨四時止、各路戰况如下㊀楊樹浦江灣閘北一帶敵屢次反攻、均被我軍奮勇擊退我防務異常鞏固、陣綫無變動、㊁吳淞一帶戰事、最為激烈、敵增援部隊、在飛機大砲掩護下、又有二千人登陸、全力向我陣地進攻、薄暮我生力軍開到、展開最猛烈之血戰、至今晨二時、砲火稍停、頑敵已被我軍包圍中、吳淞砲台灣及寶山縣城、確在我軍手中、外傳失守、絕對不確、㊂羅店至瀏河間之曹王廟一帶、負嵎殘敵、經我軍擊潰、乘勝追擊至羅店鎮北之盛橋、㊃敵軍事計劃、企圖以左右翼主力夾擊月浦鎮、謀打通吳淞與羅店之聯絡、該地我方已有重兵戒備敵决難得逞、敵軍在吳淞羅店兩區登陸、瞬將旬日、迭經我軍痛擊、創傷甚巨、惟敵軍戰略、仍着重在各該處發展、昨日在大砲飛機轟炸掩護之下、又有二千人在砲台灣吳淞鎮一帶登陸、並擬夾擊月浦鎮、以期打通吳淞區與羅店之聯絡、然後再向我全綫猛攻、我軍已在月浦鎮派重兵戒備、嚴陣以待、預料一二日內將有劇戰發生、中央社、據午夜確息、敵增援部隊二千人、昨晨再度在吳淞鎮强迫登陸、敵機十餘架、在上空向我軍地投彈轟炸、江心敵艦、亦以大砲密集射擊、我扼守部隊不避犧牲、向登陸敵軍奮勇迎擊、激戰數小時、卒以該鎮迫近江邊、敵軍砲火過於猛烈、不得已向後稍退、敵軍登陸後向寶山方面繼續進犯、我應援部隊趕到、乘敵軍陣地尚未穩固時、迎頭痛擊、敵死傷數百人、卽向吳淞鎮潰退、我軍亦未窮追、現扼守堅固陣地、與敵對峙中、敵企圖與羅店方面殘敵溝通、决難得逞、</p>
<p>吳淞一帶鎭日血戰</p>
<p>吳淞方面、自昨晨至晚、雙方均在激戰中、我軍於生力軍趕到後、卽將敵三面包圍、尙在兜剿中、敵方經我軍連日圍剿後、損失奇重、故昨晚（三十一日）十一時左右、續有敵援軍、分乘商輪八艘、開抵吳淞口、其中一艘、由另一軍艦保護、駛赴瀏河一帶而去、餘皆集結吳淞口外五十浬洋面、</p>
<p>吳淞鎮附近、昨日自朝至暮、激戰未停、互有傷亡、鎭上有數處發生火警、至午時燃燒愈烈、寶山縣城及附近村莊、亦中敵方砲彈、多處起火、損失頗巨、</p>
<p>羅店我軍進抵盛橋</p>
<p>羅店方面、昨日間我□□師進展至曹王廟普家廟施相公廟以後、卽繼續向北推進、敵軍向西潰退、殘部僅剩五百餘人、經我軍乘戰勝餘威、步步進逼之下、現我軍已抵羅店北面之盛橋、此役斃敵甚衆、並截獲敵軍用品甚多、</p>
<p>昨午某軍事機關接得前方報吿、羅店西北方面之敵軍、經我軍擊退、並佔領其營地後、敵軍於前晚起、又以大隊生力軍、在其軍艦大砲掩護之下、猛烈反攻羅店鎭我軍陣地、我軍當卽奮起還攻、激戰甚猛、槍砲之聲、聯續不斷、至昨日上午六時後、敵機十餘架、復來助戰、我忠勇將士、雖在敵人砲火重重壓迫之下、仍浴血向敵人猛撲、</p>
<p>江灣閘北敵均潰退</p>
<p>昨晨六時許、敵軍三百餘名、曾圖向殷行區遠東運動場進犯、並先在該處附近觀音橋·楊家宅兩處、暗架浮橋、希圖偷渡、進襲我方陣地、我軍靜伏以待、俟其渡至中流、立時槍砲齊發、敵軍見我有備、倉皇退走、因此被我槍傷溺斃者無數、我軍乘勝追擊至王家宅附近、敵軍僅剩二百餘名、我軍正繼續追擊中、</p>
<p>江灣路日本海軍醫院附近丁家巷之數百殘敵、於昨晨十時、傾其全力向我江灣路愛國女校等處陣地反攻、我軍立起應戰、並以迫擊砲小鋼砲機關槍等向敵猛烈掃射、結果、敵不支潰退、昨晨閘北春江路方面、敵軍曾突然出擊、在大砲掩護下、向我陣地襲擊、我軍沉着應戰、雙方激戰至上午十時、敵終不支潰退、</p>
<p>虬江碼頭敵遭痛擊</p>
<p>昨日上午虬江碼頭方面、有敵軍一部在該處登陸、另有一小隊在虬江碼頭後面觀音堂地方、向我進犯、經我守軍迎頭痛擊、未被所逞、又昨晨陸家閘方面、有少數敵兵在該處登陸、我軍初尚佯為不知、俟敵陸續登岸、我軍突然出擊、槍砲齊發、敵軍措手不及、死傷甚重、不支潰退、</p>
<p>敵軍封鎖楊樹浦區</p>
<p>神州社云、敵軍憑藉租界東區根據地、向我開釁、因連遭敗北、現敵亟欲謀澈底將該處作為軍事要隘、以便與我頑抗、上月卅一日、竟限令我留居該區之貧苦居民一律撤退、以便民房駐兵、及固築工事後、昨復封鎖虹口及楊樹浦區域、卽西人出入、亦受限制、昨敵軍司令部對外國記者宣稱、虹口及楊樹浦封鎖區、除拒華人出入外、外人得進入該區者、為工部局巡捕·萬國商團團員·工部局華籍巡捕穿着制服者·外籍兵士·及持有第三艦隊司令官或日領館所發通行證之西人、及携有通行證之日商所僱外籍職員、至於居住封鎖區域內外人持有日總領館通行證者、亦僅限於出入下列各地之南段、（甲）虹口方面、靶子路·狄思威路、（乙）楊樹浦方面、爲塘山路·及西華德路·倍開爾路·平凉路·海州路·臨靑路、至於沿碼頭一带貨棧、除中日者外、屬於其他各國人者、暫亦容許開啟、又謂被日人僱用之中西人、可出入於海軍警戒區、不受阻礙、外白渡橋開放時間、爲每日上午八時至下午五時、以後卽暫止通行云、對於日軍此種蠻橫行為、頗易使居民發生危險、聞工部局方面、將發出通吿、令該區內華人撤退、俾免警權不及之危險、</p>
<p>敵援軍三師團抵滬</p>
<p>楊樹浦一帶敵軍陣地、於昨日起、已換由正規陸軍擔任、原守該處之殘餘陸戰隊已移駐虹口一帶、似有急待補充模樣、</p>
<p>中央社、自八一三事變後、敵海軍陸戰隊迭為我軍所挫、節節敗退、敵乃不惜傾其全國之精銳、重犯我疆土、圖最後之一逞、日來陸續到滬之援軍、已達三師團之衆、該項抵滬之陸軍、均係該國精銳部隊、混合編配所成、計為久留米第十二師團之福岡第十二旅團、差通寺第十一師團之往島第二十二旅團、廣島第五師團之山口第二十一旅團、名古屋第三師團之靜岡第二十九旅團、全澤第九師團之敦賀第十八旅團、熊本第六師團之鹿兒島第三十六旅團、</p>
<p>敵艦續運械彈到滬</p>
<p>自敵輪貝發丸·天祥丸·及上海丸三艘先後來滬、卸去大批軍械彈藥後、前晚復有敵運輸艦及商輪各一艘駛滬、該運輸艦停靠於招商北棧碼頭、自前晚起、卽有日軍三四十人、起卸彈械、記者於昨日上午十一時經過該處時、目覩有鋼砲一架、自艦中運上碼頭、另商輪一艘、（名號不明則停靠於匯山碼頭、有日軍六七十人、亦在起卸彈械、同時並另有戰馬十餘匹、自艦上卸下、敵軍亟亟增援、益見其寇滬後戰事之不利、及損失之重大、</p>
<p>敵艦又砲轟我浦東</p>
<p>昨日下午三時半、停泊黃浦碼頭附近第十一號浮筒之敵砲艦一艘、頻向我浦東一帶陣地轟擊、至四時許始告停止、</p>
<p>虹口敵軍日夜換班</p>
<p>確悉、虹口之敵久被我軍所圍、現敵軍爲調節起見、日間由陸戰隊及在鄕軍人担任防務、夜間則換正規軍反攻、但因陣地不能展開、我軍復防守嚴密、敵殊難得逞、</p>
<p>敵軍截斷浦江浮筒</p>
<p>中央社、敵軍為便於登陸計、曾將浦江兩岸之浮筒多處截斷、用軍艦拖至渠預備登陸之處所、俾便建築臨時碼頭、記者於昨日（一日）過浦江時、見匯山碼頭對過泰同煤棧浦邊浮筒五六個、巳被敵軍截去應用矣、</p>
<p>敵艦常在崇明游弋</p>
<p>頃據崇明縣電吿、敵艦日來常在該島附近海面游弋、但截止發電時止、地方尚為安靜</p>
<p>抗敵靑年出發前綫</p>
<p>中華靑年抗敵救亡團團員若干人、於昨晚（一日）七時、由趙剛義·范天焦　率領、赴前方工作、一俟該地服務完畢、卽調往某某等處、從事警衛工作、</p>
<p>滬南各處昨又被炸</p>
<p>中央社云、昨日下午六時四十分、有敵機一架、飛赴南市及滬杭路一帶偵察、該機飛至南市車站路外、日暉橋附近時、曾投二炸彈、一落某處空地、一落附近河中、並無損失云、</p>
<p>昨日浦江敵艦調查</p>
<p>中央社、駛滬之敵艦、據記者昨日調查所得、其大部皆集結於吳淞浦面及瀏河一帶、計自張華浜起、經蕰藻浜而吳淞鎭、而砲台灣、獅子林至瀏河、每隔里許、輒有敵艦停駐、而其總數、尚在六十艘以上、此外並尚有商輪二三十艘、作運載兵士及彈藥之用、至於東溝以內一帶浦面、昨日所泊敵艦共爲十七艘、其分泊情形如下、計黃浦碼頭驅逐艦一艘、招商局北棧運輸艦一艘、三菱碼頭驅逐艦二艘、一艘為二十一號、另一艘名號已塗去、一號浮筒驅逐艦一艘、二號浮筒出雲旗艦一艘、四號浮筒砲艦一艘、六號七號十號浮筒驅逐艦各一艘、十一號浮筒砲艦一艘、十三號浮筒驅逐艦一艘、十六號浮筒砲艦一艘、十七號十九號浮筒驅逐艦各十艘、二十二號及三十五號浮筒砲艦各一艘、另停靠匯山碼頭日商輪一艘、有日軍六七十人、截至下午五時、仍在繼續起卸彈藥、匯山碼頭有日軍百餘、亦正起運彈械甚為忙碌、</p>
<p>撈屍船隻敵亦拘捕</p>
<p>浦江中被日兵殺害之無辜民衆尸身、隨波逐流、不下百數十具、因道德與衛生上之兩重關係、正由各界慈善團體籌備打撈、詎進行工作、已生困難、緣昨日有海關巡船舢舨四隻、搖赴虹口一帶浦面撈尸時、忽被日軍逮捕拘押、良久始由海關稅司交涉釋回、其他如救生局巡船等、欲圖打撈尸身、更為困難、故浦江大批浮尸、應如何處置、已成為一問題矣、</p>
<h3>滬杭路鐵橋昨又被敵機炸毀</h3>
<p>受損奇重暫難修復　上海西站亦被威脅</p>
<p>炸毀鐵橋</p>
<p>中央社云、自淞滬戰事發生以來、上海大多數難民、以輪行阻梗、羣向滬杭路乘車逃避、詎八月二十八日下午、上海南站突被敵機炸毀、候車難民、死傷至五六百人之多、血肉狼籍、慘不忍覩、八月二十九日上午十二時、滬杭路鐵橋一所、又被敵機炸毀甚重、客車不能通過、修理至感不易、路局為疏運難民起見、漏夜趕工、冒險修理、乃昨日（一日、上午九時半、又有敵機三架、飛向該橋上空、連投炸彈數枚、受損奇重、短時間難以修復、當敵機投彈時、該局工務處處長懷德好斯、設計課課長徐承爌等、正在工次督修、幸未受傷、但數萬難民、行將逃生無路矣、</p>
<p>投彈西站</p>
<p>中央社云、敵機肆意破壞我交通機關、並屠殺我無辜人民、上月二十八日南車站之慘案已引起各國人士士之惡劣印象、乃彼暴敵好殺成性、昨午三時、有敵機八架、在上海西站（梵皇渡）一帶低飛、來去盤旋、約歷一小時、似有所企圖、致站上候車難民驚駭異常、四散躱避、該機旋在站之西北方面、先後投下炸彈十餘枚、落於蘇州河之北、炸死無辜二人、並傷多人、</p>

<h3>接見兩外報記者楊司令之談話</h3>
<p>消滅漢奸最具决心　作戰把握靠全民族</p>
<p>（中央社）上海戒嚴司令楊虎氏、昨日接見大陸字林兩外報記者、說明戒嚴職責、及我軍作戰情况甚詳、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>戒嚴職責</p>

<h3>資金復活之實現</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>上海金融市塲。自財部頒布安定金融辦法而復業以來。資金逃避之風立戰。近復擬由中中交農四行。在漢口。重慶等十二都市。籌設聯合貼放委員。會行見內地市面。重歸活動。農工生產。不處無資。在彼縱欲破壞我經濟機構。四出騷擾。陷我於工商寂滅之域。但以我之脈絡貫通。資金內流。周轉自如。生產不絕。遑論戰事延至來春明秋。卽如十年戰爭。亦復何慮。</p>
<p>但比來各業之中。似乎隔閡未除。界限猶存。因之流轉仍欠敏捷活動。此其故由於限制太嚴者半。由於籌碼不勻者亦半。滬上大量資金之逃避。遠在戰事將發未發之際。其時外匯需要之殷切。不難從匯價之頻縮證之。及至戰事發生前所提之存款。蓋已為零星小戶之生活用費居多。然在當時。若不採適當之處置。則在人心虛慌之中。亦易招致不測之危機。今則戰事發生已半月矣。工商界對於戰事之恐怖心理。亦知從戰時環境中謀應付。轉無以前之惶急。心理旣變。環境亦異。故調整金融之辦法。似有從事實上謀其改正之必要。</p>
<p>敵機連日四出向無軍事設備之城鎭大施轟炸。彼等明知。為公法所不容。而放於冒此不韙者。正思造成。一種恐怖心理。使我內地工商歇業。生產停頓。墮其彀中耳。然如近日各地工商業之停頓。豈皆畏敵機之肆虐。正為滬上發生戰事。影響所及。不得不稍有所待耳。今四行將在內地設立聯合貼放委員會。金融旣有辦法。其他自亦可迎刃以解。至因沿海口岸作戰之故。對外貿易。呈停滯之象。此亦並不足慮。蓋我國尚未脫農業經濟時代。洋貨如不能來。不但可以寒漏巵。且資金因自然之結果。重向內流。藏富於民。國力反可充實。此正吾人平時求之而不可得也。惟內地工商業。似亦宜稍變舊日之觀念。如昔日密集於一地之工商業。今可以飛機炸彈之力。頃刻間而全部毀滅之。則為避免無謂之犧牲起見。此後宜分向內地鄉鎮移動。愼毋集中於一隅。則敵人縱橫暴。亦安得遍地加以破壞耶。</p>
<p>惟尚應加以研討者。卽逃避之資金。如何得重入於市塲。按資金之逃避。不外㊀購存外匯。㊁藏匿。要皆為疑畏一念所促成。故袪其疑畏。資金將不期然而自集。籌碼運轉旣裕如。工商業亦可復平時之狀態矣。此其道無待他求。現下進出口貿易停頓。匯價已復常。但票據之流通。仍因匯劃關係。收付之間。常有無謂之週折。至限制提存。雖用以防資金之逃避。然限制過嚴。又將堅逃避者之心理。故如何使票據之運用。不失其圓滑。及如何使所購存所藏匿之資金。重歸於銀行之庫中。此不但與金融之周轉有關。亦整個市面之榮枯所繫。又如典當一業。為“貧民之後路。”乃以現鈔缺乏之故。止當待贖。或雖照常開業。而縮短其時間。或抵抑其質價。此則又與貧民生計。社會治安。有密切之關係。故深望對於現鈔之支取。宜衡其用途。察其情由。嚴其稽核。而為分別之處置。或命其加其保證或責其提出報吿。如有逃避之作用。不妨加以嚴厲之處分。際此百業尚在停頓之中。金融為命脈所繫。能隨時勢之進展。而斟酌損益其辦法。是亦必要之處置也。</p>

<h3>抗戰聲中後方情緒的一斑（四）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員賡雅</p>
<p>鄧漢祥的談話</p>
<p>四川目前有兩大要政、即救災問題與整軍問題。川省令春旱災，區域廣至一百三十餘縣、災民達三千萬左右，可算川省兵戈後的浩刦。又四川素稱多兵之省、軍隊系統複雜、紀律意識均差，對於應盡職責，每多瑜不掩瑕。此次各軍系當局，能在艱苦的環境中，秉承中史的意旨、以最大努力，將整軍及救災兩大事件，辦理到比較有圓滿的結果，絲毫沒有發生意外的反作用，這眞是四川之福，更是中國之幸。</p>
<p>當我去省府訪問主席劉湘氏，先承秘蓄長鄧鳴喈（漢祥）氏接見。他笑着說·劉主席此刻正和整軍將領會商要事，須另行函約面談。接着他便答覆我所問的問題、茲摘要紀述如後：</p>
<p>劉氏說此次四川遵照中央方案，實行整軍，目的在充實編制的單位、以適合國防的需要。劉主席及各軍長，都一致議决，務於個月內（至八月底），將所有川康軍隊，一律編放“整理師一”。其內容充實的程度、約爲原有軍額運、今實編成二運。預料編餘軍官、約有五千人、俟思餉欠餉發後，即分別遣散歸田。至於華北問題、顯然已是日人有計劃有步驟的規模侵略，我們除抗戰以外，絕無其他辦法·目前四川整軍工作，指日完放·各縣秋收稻禾，均可在七成以上·凡我川省，對國家應盡的責任、如㊀聽調整理師赴前綫、㊁維持本省後防治安、㊂盡量供給前綫物質上的需要，我都取作負責之談，實有相當的力量與把握，願與全國同胞共勉之。</p>
<p>劉湘訪問記</p>
<p>劉主席約實在很忙，未蒙亟約面談，却先送來一個書面談話。略謂：川省軍隊量多而質欠精，這是無可言諱的事實，澈底整理，早有必要。自整軍會議商定各種方案、各軍長均能深體時難，一致表示接受。本人忝膺川康綏靖重任，曾一再電蔣委員長、表示堅决贯澈整軍。蓋国家環境險惡，非有統一健全的軍隊，不足以救亡圖存，川軍不積極整理充實，萬難適應國防的需要。因此本人决以最大努力，無論任何險阻艱難，必須達到預定的目的而後已。况今日華北情勢險惡達於極點，敵已全體動員，我亦决心抗戰。川省雖在後防，各項準備工作，萬不可緩。總之，四川所有人力財力，均可貢獻於國家。軍隊必開赴前敵民衆在後方策應。內外一致，以期盡川人應盡之責。義之所在、赴湯蹈火、所不敢辭。目前除積極從事整軍及各項準備工作外，最要者爲生產建設，省府已着手草擬三年建設計劃，個人亦决以全力促其實現也云云。</p>
<p>恰遇四川連日陰雨，成都市低窪馬路，漫水如河，成渝路不通車，飛機也暫時停航，因此我不能如期離開成都，乘機又去三多巷劉主席私邸去拜訪他。邸有中式數門，向巷開列，守衛士兵四五人，都各佩大刀及盒子砲。人門繞廊而過，忽見洋樓高聳，林蔭四圍，傳係軍長楊森所建贈者。一會兒劉氏在客廳出見，他對書面談話補充了此意見。劉氏意見略謂：華北數千里河山，舊都七百年文物，平津四百萬人民，實不容暴日鐵蹄，任意馳騁踐踏，一如“九一八”時。觀蔣委員長在廬山發表的兩次談話，知我當局亦痛下决心、固守立塲、絕不容許日本的暴行，再事擴大。然欲獲得此項最低的期冀、必須傾盡全國軍民所有的力量，以與敵人相周旋　　爲此，本人曾數電蔣委員長請纓抗戰，都已得到贊許的覆示。在某種觀點上，我們準備雖還不夠，但敵人得寸進尺的侵略行為，步步逼近我們的要害，實不容我們再悠游緩了。我門深信，一致在中央領導應職之下，抱定“寗爲玉碎，不爲瓦全”的决心，能繼續抗戰到一年以上，最後勝利之神，就要向我招手了。</p>
<p>綜觀川當局發表的談話，對於所持擁護中央，發動全民抗戰的態度，都是始終一贯，非富堅决的。</p>

<h3>Enemy Plots to Take Wusong and Luodian: Our Army is Highly Alert and Ready</h3>
<p>Fierce Battles Expected in the Next Day or Two. Bloody Fighting in Wusong Continues Throughout the Day, Enemy Unable to Succeed. Enemy Attempts to Counterattack in Jiangwan and Zhabei Repeatedly Repelled.</p>
<p>As of 4:00 AM this morning, the battle situation on all fronts is as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ In the Yangshupu, Jiangwan, and Zhabei areas, the enemy launched repeated counterattacks, all of which were bravely repelled by our troops. Our defenses are extremely solid, and the front lines remain unchanged.</p>
<p>㊁ The fighting in the Wusong area is the most intense. The enemy reinforced their forces, and under the cover of aircraft and artillery, another 2,000 men landed, launching a full-scale attack on our positions. In the evening, our fresh troops arrived and engaged in the most fierce bloody battle. By 2:00 AM this morning, the artillery fire had subsided slightly. The stubborn enemy has been surrounded by our forces. Wusong Fort, Taiwan, and Baoshan County are definitely in our hands. Rumors of their loss are absolutely false.</p>
<p>㊂ The remnants of the enemy in the Caowangmiao area between Luodian and Liuhe were defeated by our troops. We pursued the victory to Shengqiao, north of Luodian Town.</p>
<p>㊃ The enemy's military plan is to attempt to encircle Yuepu Town with the main forces on the left and right wings, in an attempt to open up communication between Wusong and Luodian. Our side has already deployed heavy troops in the area, and the enemy will definitely not succeed. The enemy troops have been landing in the Wusong and Luodian areas for nearly ten days. They have suffered heavy blows from our army, sustaining significant injuries. However, the enemy's strategy still focuses on developing these areas. Yesterday, under the cover of artillery and aircraft bombardment, another 2,000 men landed in the Fort Taiwan and Wusong Town area, and planned to attack Yuepu Town in an attempt to open up communication between the Wusong area and Luodian. Our army has already deployed heavy troops in Yuepu Town, highly alert and ready. Fierce battles are expected in the next day or two. Central News Agency, according to confirmed midnight news, the enemy's reinforcements of 2,000 men forcibly landed in Wusong Town again yesterday morning. More than a dozen enemy planes bombed and shelled our military positions from the air. Enemy warships in the river also fired intensively with artillery. Our defending troops, regardless of sacrifice, bravely countered the landing enemy troops. After several hours of fierce fighting, the town was forced to retreat slightly due to its proximity to the river and the enemy's excessive artillery fire. After landing, the enemy continued to invade towards Baoshan. Our reinforcements arrived and, taking advantage of the enemy's unstable positions, launched a fierce frontal attack, killing and wounding hundreds of enemy soldiers, who then retreated to Wusong Town. Our army did not pursue them and is now defending a solid position, confronting the enemy. The enemy's attempt to communicate with the remaining enemy forces in Luodian will definitely not succeed.</p>
<p>Bloody Battles Raged All Day in Wusong</p>
<p>In the Wusong area, both sides were engaged in fierce battles from yesterday morning to evening. After our fresh troops arrived, they surrounded the enemy on three sides and are still encircling and suppressing them. The enemy has suffered heavy losses after days of encirclement and suppression by our army. Therefore, around 11:00 PM last night (July 31st), additional enemy reinforcements, divided into eight merchant ships, arrived at the mouth of Wusong. One of them, protected by another warship, sailed to the Liuhe area, while the rest gathered 50 nautical miles outside the mouth of Wusong.</p>
<p>Near Wusong Town, fierce battles continued from morning to dusk yesterday. Both sides suffered casualties. Several fires broke out in the town, and the burning intensified at noon. Baoshan County and nearby villages were also hit by enemy artillery shells, causing fires in many places and significant losses.</p>
<p>Our Army in Luodian Reaches Shengqiao</p>
<p>In the Luodian area, yesterday, our [illegible] division advanced to Caowangmiao, Pujiamiao, and Shixianggongmiao, and then continued to advance north. The enemy troops retreated westward, with only about 500 remnants remaining. Under the victorious momentum of our army, step by step, our army has now reached Shengqiao, north of Luodian. Many enemies were killed in this battle, and many enemy supplies were seized.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a military agency received a front-line report that the enemy troops in the northwest of Luodian had been repelled by our army and their camp occupied. The enemy troops launched a fierce counterattack on our army's positions in Luodian Town from the night before, under the cover of their warships and artillery. Our army immediately rose up to counterattack, and the sounds of guns and artillery were continuous. After 6:00 AM yesterday morning, more than a dozen enemy planes came to help in the battle. Our loyal and brave soldiers, despite being heavily pressed by enemy artillery fire, still bathed in blood and pounced on the enemy.</p>
<p>Enemy Routed in Jiangwan and Zhabei</p>
<p>At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, more than 300 enemy troops attempted to invade the Far East Sports Field in the Yinhang District, and secretly built pontoon bridges at Guanyinqiao and Yangjiazai nearby, hoping to cross the river secretly and attack our positions. Our army waited in ambush, and when they crossed to the middle of the river, they immediately opened fire with guns and artillery. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy troops fled in panic. Countless enemies were shot, wounded, and drowned. Our army took advantage of the victory and pursued them to the vicinity of Wangjiazai. Only about 200 enemy troops remained, and our army is continuing to pursue them.</p>
<p>Hundreds of remnants of the enemy near Dingjia Lane, near the Japanese Naval Hospital on Jiangwan Road, launched a full-scale counterattack on our positions at the Patriotic Girls' School on Jiangwan Road at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Our army immediately responded and used mortars, small steel cannons, and machine guns to fiercely sweep the enemy. As a result, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. Yesterday morning, on Chunjiang Road in Zhabei, the enemy troops launched a sudden attack under the cover of artillery, attacking our positions. Our army responded calmly, and after fierce fighting between the two sides until 10:00 AM, the enemy finally collapsed and retreated.</p>
<p>Enemy Suffers Heavy Blows at Qujiang Wharf</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a part of the enemy troops landed at the Qujiang Wharf, and another small team invaded us at Guanyintang, behind the Qujiang Wharf. They were met with a head-on blow by our defending troops and were unsuccessful. Also, yesterday morning, a small number of enemy soldiers landed at Lujiazha. Our army initially pretended not to know, and when the enemy landed one after another, our army suddenly attacked, firing guns and artillery. The enemy troops were caught off guard, suffered heavy casualties, and collapsed.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Block Off Yangshupu District</p>
<p>Shenzhou News Agency reports that the enemy troops, relying on the concession's eastern district as a base, have provoked us. Due to repeated defeats, the enemy is now eager to completely turn the area into a military stronghold in order to resist us. On July 31st, they ordered all poor residents living in the area to evacuate in order to station troops in the civilian houses and build fortifications. Yesterday, they blocked off the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas. Even Westerners were restricted from entering and leaving. Yesterday, the enemy's headquarters declared to foreign reporters that the Hongkou and Yangshupu blockade areas, in addition to prohibiting Chinese from entering and leaving, allow foreigners to enter the area who are members of the Municipal Council Police, the International Volunteer Corps, Chinese Municipal Council Police in uniform, foreign soldiers, and Westerners holding permits issued by the Third Fleet Commander or the Japanese Consulate, and foreign employees hired by Japanese merchants with permits. As for foreigners residing in the blockade area holding permits from the Japanese Consulate General, they are only allowed to enter and leave the southern sections of the following areas: (A) Hongkou: Bazilu, Diswei Road; (B) Yangshupu: Tangshan Road, Xihuaide Road, Beikai'er Road, Pingliang Road, Haizhou Road, and Linqing Road. As for the warehouses along the wharf area, except for those owned by Chinese and Japanese, those belonging to other countries are temporarily allowed to open. It is also said that Chinese and Westerners employed by the Japanese can enter and leave the naval restricted area without hindrance. The Waibaidu Bridge is open from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day, and will be temporarily closed after that. This kind of barbaric behavior by the Japanese army is likely to endanger residents. It is reported that the Municipal Council will issue a notice ordering the Chinese in the area to evacuate in order to avoid the danger of the police being unable to intervene.</p>
<p>Enemy Reinforcements of Three Divisions Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since yesterday, the enemy's military positions in the Yangshupu area have been taken over by regular army troops. The remaining marines who were originally stationed there have been transferred to the Hongkou area, seemingly in urgent need of replenishment.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the August 13th Incident, the enemy's naval marines have been repeatedly defeated by our army and have retreated step by step. The enemy is now sparing no effort to pour its national elite into invading our territory again, attempting a final desperate effort. The reinforcements that have arrived in Shanghai one after another have reached a total of three divisions. The army that has arrived in Shanghai is composed of the country's elite troops, mixed and matched, including the Fukuoka 12th Brigade of the Kurume 12th Division, the Ikushima 22nd Brigade of the Kokura 11th Division, the Yamaguchi 21st Brigade of the Hiroshima 5th Division, the Shizuoka 29th Brigade of the Nagoya 3rd Division, the Tsuruga 18th Brigade of the Kanazawa 9th Division, and the Kagoshima 36th Brigade of the Kumamoto 6th Division.</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Continue to Transport Weapons and Ammunition to Shanghai</p>
<p>After the enemy ships Beifa Maru, Tianxiang Maru, and Shanghai Maru arrived in Shanghai one after another and unloaded large quantities of weapons and ammunition, another enemy transport ship and a merchant ship sailed to Shanghai the night before. The transport ship docked at the Zhaoshang North Bund Wharf, and since the night before, 30 to 40 Japanese soldiers have been unloading ammunition. When reporters passed by the area at 11:00 AM yesterday, they witnessed a steel cannon being transported from the ship to the wharf. Another merchant ship (name unknown) docked at the Huishan Wharf, and 60 to 70 Japanese soldiers were also unloading ammunition, and more than a dozen war horses were unloaded from the ship at the same time. The enemy's urgent reinforcements show the unfavorable nature of the war after their invasion of Shanghai and the extent of their losses.</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Bombard Our Pudong Again</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM yesterday, an enemy gunboat moored near the No. 11 buoy near the Huangpu Wharf frequently bombarded our positions in the Pudong area, and stopped around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops in Hongkou Rotate Day and Night</p>
<p>It is confirmed that the enemy in Hongkou has been surrounded by our army for a long time. In order to adjust, the enemy troops are defended by the marines and veterans during the day, and the regular army is replaced at night to counterattack. However, because the positions cannot be deployed and our army's defenses are tight, the enemy is difficult to succeed.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Cut Off Pudong River Pontoons</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that in order to facilitate landing, the enemy troops have cut off many of the pontoons on both sides of the Huangpu River and towed them to the places where they plan to land in order to build temporary wharves. When reporters passed the Huangpu River yesterday (1st), they saw five or six pontoons on the Pudong shore of the Taitong Coal Wharf across from the Huishan Wharf had been cut off and used by the enemy.</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Often Cruise in Chongming</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Chongming County, enemy warships have been cruising in the waters near the island in recent days, but the area is still quiet as of the time of the telegram.</p>
<p>Youths Fighting Against the Enemy Depart for the Front Lines</p>
<p>Several members of the China Youth Anti-Enemy Salvation Corps, led by Zhao Gangyi and Fan Tianjiao, left for the front lines for work at 7:00 PM last night (1st). After their service in the area is completed, they will be transferred to other locations, such as XX, to engage in guard work.</p>
<p>Various Places in Southern Shanghai Were Bombed Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that at 6:40 PM yesterday, an enemy plane flew to Nanshi and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway area for reconnaissance. When the plane flew to the outside of Chezhan Road in Nanshi, near Rihui Bridge, it dropped two bombs, one in an open space and one in the river nearby, without any losses.</p>
<p>Investigation of Enemy Warships in Huangpu River Yesterday</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that, according to investigations by reporters yesterday, most of the enemy warships that sailed to Shanghai are gathered in the Wusong River and Liuhe areas. From Zhanghuabang, through Yunzaobang to Wusong Town, to Fort Taiwan, Lion Grove, and Liuhe, there are enemy warships stationed every mile or so, and their total number is more than 60. In addition, there are 20 to 30 merchant ships for transporting soldiers and ammunition. As for the area within Donggou, there were a total of 17 enemy warships moored yesterday, and their distribution is as follows: one destroyer at the Huangpu Wharf, one transport ship at the Zhaoshang North Bund, two destroyers at the Mitsubishi Wharf (one is No. 21, the other's name has been painted over), one destroyer at the No. 1 buoy, one Izumo flagship at the No. 2 buoy, one gunboat at the No. 4 buoy, one destroyer each at the No. 6, No. 7, and No. 10 buoys, one gunboat at the No. 11 buoy, one destroyer at the No. 13 buoy, one gunboat at the No. 16 buoy, ten destroyers each at the No. 17 and No. 19 buoys, one gunboat each at the No. 22 and No. 35 buoys, and one Japanese merchant ship moored at the Huishan Wharf, with 60 to 70 Japanese soldiers, who were still continuing to unload ammunition as of 5:00 PM. More than 100 Japanese soldiers at the Huishan Wharf were also busy transporting ammunition.</p>
<p>Enemy Also Arrests Ships Retrieving Corpses</p>
<p>The bodies of innocent civilians killed by Japanese soldiers in the Huangpu River flow with the waves, numbering no less than one hundred. For both moral and sanitary reasons, various charitable organizations are preparing to retrieve them, but difficulties have arisen in the process. Yesterday, four customs patrol boats were rowing to the Huangpu River in the Hongkou area to retrieve corpses when they were suddenly arrested and detained by the Japanese army. They were released after a long time after negotiations by the customs tax officer. Other ships, such as the Lifesaving Bureau patrol boats, have even more difficulty trying to retrieve the bodies. Therefore, how to deal with the large number of floating corpses in the Huangpu River has become a problem.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bridge Destroyed by Enemy Aircraft Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Damage is Extremely Severe, Difficult to Repair Temporarily. Shanghai West Station is Also Threatened</p>
<p>Destroyed Railway Bridge</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the outbreak of the Songhu War, most of the refugees in Shanghai have been taking trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to escape because the waterways were blocked. However, on the afternoon of August 28th, the Shanghai South Railway Station was suddenly destroyed by enemy aircraft, and the waiting refugees were killed and wounded, numbering as many as five or six hundred. The scene was a bloody mess and unbearable to witness. At 12:00 noon on August 29th, a railway bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was also heavily damaged by enemy aircraft. Passenger cars could not pass, and repairs were extremely difficult. In order to transport refugees, the railway bureau worked overnight and risked repairs. However, yesterday (1st), at 9:30 AM, three enemy aircraft flew over the bridge and dropped several bombs, causing extremely severe damage and making it difficult to repair in a short period of time. When the enemy aircraft dropped bombs, the director of the bureau's engineering department, Huaide Haosi, and the design section chief, Xu Chengkuang, were supervising the repairs at the work site, fortunately they were not injured, but tens of thousands of refugees will have no way to escape.</p>
<p>Bombing West Station</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that enemy aircraft wantonly destroy our transportation facilities and massacre our innocent people. The tragic case of the South Railway Station on August 28th has already aroused negative impressions among people from all countries. However, these violent enemies are bloodthirsty by nature. At 3:00 PM yesterday, eight enemy aircraft flew low over the Shanghai West Station (Fanhangdu) area, circling back and forth for about an hour, seemingly with some intention, causing the refugees waiting for trains at the station to panic and scatter to hide. The aircraft then dropped more than a dozen bombs in the northwest direction of the station, landing north of the Suzhou River, killing two innocent people and injuring many others.</p>
<h3>Reuters Reporter Describes Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Participation in Military Affairs</h3>
<p>Truly an Innovation in the History of China's New Era</p>
<p>Central News Agency, this city, Reuters reports that a Reuters reporter has recently returned from the capital and claims that it is truly an innovation in the history of China's new era for a woman to participate in military conferences of army staff. The person is Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the wife of Chairman Chiang. The Madame sits around a table with the Chairman's military advisors, discussing air combat and air defense affairs. Madame personally observes every enemy aircraft attack on the capital, unafraid of danger. After the enemy aircraft leave, she personally visits various places to investigate the losses. The Chairman is the chairman of the Aviation Commission, and the Madame is the secretary of the commission. The Reuters reporter was led into her office, which is where the Madame works from dawn until midnight. The interior is simply furnished, with only a few ordinary desks. The Madame often uses a portable typewriter to write. A painting of Jesus hangs on the side of the desk, and a can of chocolate candy is placed on the desk. Two machine guns are placed in the corner of the room, which were recently used to shoot down Japanese aircraft in the capital. The capital has a wartime laboratory managed by the Madame. All war remnants, such as destroyed Japanese aircraft, are inspected by the Madame and experts. The Madame has been involved in reorganizing China's aviation industry for a year. When the first meeting was in progress, the news of the Chairman's Xi'an Incident came suddenly. After the Chairman escaped danger, the Madame completed the reorganization work. In this Sino-Japanese War, all administrative work related to aviation issues is handled by the Madame herself, assisted by several secretaries. None of the secretaries are women. The Madame attends all army and air force strategy meetings. In addition to administrative and technical responsibilities, the Madame also closely cares about the air force personnel, visiting the airfields from time to time, personally inspecting the equipment of the pilots and their daily lives, and even taking care of their meals. She readily accepts any suggestions from the pilots. When the Chairman receives foreign guests, the Madame often acts as an interpreter and drafts correspondence with foreign governments. The Madame graduated from Wellesley College in the United States, so she speaks fluent English and is good at writing. The Madame still guides the New Life Movement in her spare time and cares about the lives of displaced people. The Madame pays attention to world affairs and reads all Reuters telegrams received in the capital. The Madame and the Chairman live a simple life and pray for half an hour every morning and evening. In her spare time, the Madame likes to read newspapers and magazines, especially those published in English and American about women, family, and humanitarianism. According to a close friend of the Madame, the Madame has a great spirit of fearlessness. When British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was attacked by Japanese aircraft on the Nanjing-Shanghai Highway, the Madame and the Chairman were in a war zone far from Nanjing. It is rumored that the Japanese aircraft must have mistaken Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's car for the one carrying the Chairman and the Madame. It is said that the Chairman and the Madame are willing to die under the Chinese flag in the war and are determined not to travel under the protection of a foreign flag.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals in Qingdao and Warships Will Be Completely Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Approximately in Five Days</p>
<p>[Qingdao] All Japanese nationals residing in Qingdao, including consulate personnel and warships, have been ordered by Tokyo to withdraw from Qingdao. The withdrawal will be completed around September 5th. The assets of the Japanese nationals here, including the power plant, are valued at 30 million yuan, which will be transferred to the Chinese authorities for safekeeping (Central News Agency telegram, 31st).</p>
<p>[Qingdao] The Japanese ship Nikko Maru sailed to Moji at 9:00 AM on the 31st, carrying 605 Japanese men, 13 women, and 17 children. The Dalian Maru sailed to Dalian at noon, carrying 506 Japanese men, 2 women, 10 children, and 136 Koreans, including 20 Japanese police officers. The two ships carried a total of 1,289 Japanese nationals (Central News Agency telegram, 31st).</p>
<p>Since our army has resisted the enemy, it has fought bloodily and won victories step by step. The Central Government has specially sent Central Committee members Gan Naikang and Mao Zuquan to慰勞 the anti-Japanese soldiers</p>

<h3>Interview with Commander Yang by Two Foreign Newspaper Reporters</h3>
<p>Determined to Eliminate Traitors. Confident in Victory Because of the Entire Nation</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Shanghai Garrison Commander Yang Hushi yesterday met with reporters from the Continental and North China Daily News, explaining the duties of the garrison and the war situation of our army in detail. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Responsibilities of the Garrison</p>
<p>The garrison was established to meet the needs of the rear during wartime. The responsibilities of the garrison are to stabilize the rear. Stabilizing the rear can help the front. The main means of stabilizing the rear are: first, to eliminate traitors; second, to stabilize local order; and third, to guide various social groups to adapt to the necessary state of wartime. Among them, I am particularly determined to eliminate traitors. However, this requires the assistance of the concession police authorities. I believe that the concession police authorities will be able to provide us with assistance, because the various criminal acts of traitors, although aimed at disrupting the operations of the Chinese army and disrupting local security in China, are based in the concession area, which inevitably affects the order and security of the concession. Therefore, the concession police authorities assisting the garrison in eliminating traitors is equivalent to eliminating the source of harm to order and security in the concession itself. The concession authorities should be happy to do so. In addition, regarding the safety of Western residents in the area of extraterritorial roads, I have already paid attention and am now trying to provide effective guarantees.</p>
<p>War Situation</p>
<p>In this Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese side is fundamentally a warlike act of aggression with wild ambitions, while the Chinese side is a war of resistance for national survival. Therefore, regarding the war situation on both sides, the enemy's propaganda is an organized exaggeration and insult. The Chinese side only cares about resisting with strength and is unwilling to do much propaganda. Because of this relationship, there are some misunderstandings in international news. I hope that international news will pay attention to this. As for the current war situation on each front, we don't need to analyze it from all aspects of the front line. As long as we talk about Luodian, which the other side considers a successful major operation, the approximately one division that initially landed is now left with remnants, which is only a struggle of time. The same is true for the seaports in other areas such as Wusong. No matter how the other side uses the navy's guerrilla warfare, if the army wants to land, it will eventually face the same fate as Luodian: annihilation. As for if someone asks us why the Chinese army has this confidence, then we can answer that it is based on the spirit of the entire nation's war of resistance, the flexible use of troops, and the determination of our leader.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Realization of Capital Revival</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial market, since the Ministry of Finance promulgated measures to stabilize finance and resumed operations, has stemmed the tide of capital flight. Recently, it is planned that the four banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, will establish joint discounting committees in twelve cities including Hankou and Chongqing. It is expected that the domestic market will regain activity, and agricultural and industrial production will not lack funds. Those who attempt to destroy our economic structure and create disturbances everywhere, plunging us into a state of commercial and industrial stagnation, will be thwarted. Our connected network and the internal flow of capital will allow for smooth turnover and uninterrupted production. We need not worry about the war extending into the spring or autumn of next year, or even a ten-year war.</p>
<p>However, it seems that divisions and boundaries still exist among various industries. As a result, circulation remains slow and inactive. This is due in part to overly strict restrictions and in part to uneven distribution of resources. The large-scale escape of capital from Shanghai occurred long before the outbreak of hostilities. The eagerness for foreign exchange at that time can easily be proven by the frequent fluctuations in exchange rates. The deposits withdrawn before the outbreak of the war were mostly used for living expenses by small households. However, if appropriate measures had not been taken at that time, a crisis could easily have been triggered amid public panic. Now, half a month has passed since the outbreak of the war. The business community's fear of war has transformed into a coping strategy adapted to the wartime environment, without the previous sense of panic. As psychology has changed, so has the environment. Therefore, it seems necessary to revise financial adjustment methods based on reality.</p>
<p>Enemy planes have been bombing towns and cities lacking military installations for days. They know full well that this is against international law, but they brazenly persist in creating a sense of terror, hoping to shut down our domestic commerce and industry, halt production, and trap us in their designs. However, the recent stagnation of industry and commerce in various places is not entirely due to fear of enemy aircraft attacks. It is largely due to the impact of the war in Shanghai, which has forced businesses to pause and wait. Now that the four banks are establishing joint discounting committees in the interior, financial solutions are in place, and other problems will naturally be easily resolved. Even the stagnation of foreign trade due to the fighting in coastal ports is not a major concern. After all, our country has not yet transitioned out of the agricultural economy. If foreign goods cannot come in, not only can we reduce consumption, but capital will naturally flow inward, enriching the people and strengthening the nation. This is precisely what we have been seeking but could not obtain in peacetime. However, domestic industries and businesses should also slightly change their old ideas. Just as factories and businesses that were once concentrated in one place can now be completely destroyed in an instant by aircraft and bombs, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, they should be dispersed to inland towns and villages in the future. If they are not concentrated in one area, how can the enemy wantonly destroy everything?</p>
<p>However, further study should be given to how to bring the escaped capital back into the market. The escape of capital is driven by two factors: ㊀ purchasing and storing foreign exchange and ㊁ hiding it. Both are caused by fear and doubt. Therefore, dispelling fear and doubt will naturally attract capital back. With ample resources for turnover, industry and commerce can return to their normal state. The path to this is obvious. Now that import and export trade has stopped, exchange rates have returned to normal. However, the circulation of bills is still hampered by unnecessary complications in transfers. Restrictions on withdrawals, though intended to prevent capital flight, may strengthen the resolve of those who seek to escape. Therefore, it is important to ensure the smooth operation of bills and to encourage the return of purchased or hidden capital to the banks. This is not only related to financial turnover but also to the prosperity of the entire market. Furthermore, the pawnshop industry, as a "last resort for the poor," is suffering from a lack of cash. Pawnshops are either only accepting redemptions or, even if they remain open, are shortening their hours or lowering their valuations. This has a close relationship with the livelihood of the poor and social security. Therefore, close attention should be paid to cash withdrawals, evaluating their intended use, examining their circumstances, and rigorously auditing them to take appropriate measures. If there is a potential for capital flight, strict penalties should be imposed. As all industries are still in a state of suspension, finance is the lifeblood. It is necessary to adjust policies and measures in response to changing circumstances.</p>

<p>Fierce battles with the enemy northwest of Machang　Both sides are in a stalemate at Tangguantun　Enemy forces surround Liangxiang on three sides</p>

<p>[Jinan] In the Jinpu Railway Line battle, the enemy forces have not yet crossed the west side of the Grand Canal. Duliu Town is still garrisoned by our army. A unit of our left wing has reached the Xiaozhan area, and guerrillas appear from time to time, causing the enemy forces to be exhausted. At Huifeng Bridge on the Jinyan Highway northeast of Tangguantun, the enemy forces, guided by bandits, are launching fierce attacks. However, our army is fully prepared, and although the enemy is stubborn, it will be difficult for them to succeed. There have been fierce battles for several days. On the frontal side, both sides are in a stalemate at Tangguantun. A reporter met with a military commander in Cangzhou on the 30th, who expressed great optimism about this resistance war and said that for the sake of national survival, even if only one person and one bullet remain, they will fight the enemy. He also said that this resistance war has a front line that stretches for thousands of miles, and the loss or gain of a single county or town in the front is not worth emphasizing. Only the final outcome matters. A unit has now been fully deployed to the Jinpu Railway Line to join the fighting. It is expected that there will be great progress in the Jinpu area. The people's militia in various parts of Hebei Province have provided much assistance to the army in this battle, often surprising the enemy, using indigenous cannons and rifles to attack the enemy, with remarkable results. A tank was captured from the enemy in Tangguantun a few days ago, and many Japanese soldiers were killed, which shows that the people of our country have the same determination to resist the war as the government. The victory of the resistance war can be predicted. On the afternoon of the 30th, fifteen enemy planes went to Cangzhou to bomb, dropping more than a hundred bombs in the city and along the Grand Canal, and strafing with machine guns, injuring eighty or ninety innocent civilians and killing more than thirty mules and horses.

<h3>US Policy Unlikely to Change in Response to Far East Situation</h3>

<p>⊙Hyde Park　President Roosevelt was heard to have had three telephone calls with Washington in one day. The US government's position on the Far East has changed dramatically within 24 hours. (National Telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>[London] The US attitude towards the Far East situation is worth noting. According to a report from the Washington correspondent of the Morning Post, isolationists have not yet been able to achieve their goal of declaring neutrality, and the authorities are moving towards active cooperation with Britain and France. According to the correspondent's opinion, even if the Neutrality Act is enacted now, it will not change the general impression of US policy. The United States will continue to cooperate with other countries to maintain peace in China and protect its interests in the Far East. Furthermore, well-informed sources in London said that if the United States is willing to take more active actions this time to put pressure on Japan, Britain and France will immediately respond and cooperate. However, there is no indication of this so far. Japan's financial weakness and its reliance on imported raw materials are highly valued here. The Mencius Guidance Report stated that Japanese public opinion had expressed concern about the future of Japanese export business even before the Shanghai Incident occurred. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<h3>Japan Delays Reply to British Note</h3>
<p>What is the Intention of Evacuating Overseas Chinese from Qingdao?　Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Answers Questions</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with foreign reporters on the afternoon of the 1st, he said that the British note regarding the incident involving the British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen had not been answered because Japan was still investigating the matter on the ground. When asked why the investigation had taken so long, he replied that he did not know. When asked whether there were concerns about the occurrence of incidents like the Shanghai Incident after the evacuation of Japanese overseas Chinese from Qingdao, he replied that it was similar to the evacuation from Hankou. Foreign Minister Hirota is scheduled to meet with foreign reporters at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>[London] The Tokyo correspondent of the Standard Evening News stated that Japan intends to reject the demands made by the British government regarding the injury of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen by a Japanese plane. The correspondent learned that Japan is only willing to formally apologize and refuses to provide guarantees that similar incidents will not occur again in the war zone. Japan will likely demand that Britain notify the Japanese authorities in advance when British diplomats travel in the war zone in the future. (Haitong Telegram on the 31st)</p>

<h3>Japanese Wild Bull with a Rocket in its Neck</h3>

<h3>English Newspapers Praise Our Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>China's Status Elevated; Ultimate Victory Inevitable</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, the diplomatic correspondent of the London Times wrote a commentary today, stating that if China had not risen up to resist Japan's invasion, the country would have faced disintegration and lost its national character, leading to a perilous future. "Now that it has risen to deal with Japan, its international status has risen to a height not seen in many years. If Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek can make good use of his military power in the future, ensuring China does not suffer a crushing defeat, then given China's vast territory, it can certainly sustain the war for a long time." As for Japan's strategy, the correspondent continued, the actions of the Japanese army in Shanghai today clearly indicate an intention to create an iron ring around Shanghai to prevent Chinese troops from re-entering after being driven out. In other words, Japan is attempting to re-enact the old drama of 1932 to consolidate its gains in Shanghai and concentrate its main force to advance south from North China. The correspondent then discussed the economic aspects of the Japanese military campaign, stating that North China is a source of various inexpensive minerals and raw materials. Therefore, the economic aspect is the main justification for the Japanese army's invasion of China. They aim to use force as a prelude to economic invasion, develop new sources of wealth, and utilize German-style import controls to support the domestic economy. This, he said, is the reason why the business community supports the invasion. The correspondent concluded by saying that these military-industrial figures can be considered the middle ground in Japan, with the warlords who control the overall situation on one side and ordinary industrialists and merchants on the other. They believe that peaceful aggression can achieve great profits with small expenditures. The latter group is now expanding significantly, but unfortunately, too slowly to change the warlords' original intentions. In the past year, Japan has reduced its foreign debt, and in the London market, where 70% of its foreign trade finance revolves, Japan's credit remains stable. However, domestically, it deeply feels the difficulty of paying for massive military expenditures. Furthermore, there is a shortage of raw materials and machinery needed for industrial development, as well as a shortage of skilled workers and a continuing rise in general prices, making its plight even worse. While a revaluation of the yen was possible in 1932 when world prices were low, reducing the value of the yen today would block the inflow of various much-needed imports, preventing Japan from procuring sufficient essential items from abroad, such as kerosene from the United States and the East Indies, which are indispensable for Japan.

<h3>Japanese Aggression Threatens France, Feeling</h3>
<p>"Evening News" Publishes Article</p>
<p>[Paris] The extreme left-wing newspaper "Evening News" has published several articles by "狄伏才拉" for several days, discussing the Far East situation. Today's article is the last, stating briefly, "If Japan wins against China, it will become a threat to France, and our country's Far East territories will also be in imminent danger. Japan has been meticulously planning to expand its aggression beyond China for quite some time. In recent years, it has been planning to dig the Kra Canal in Siam to connect the Pacific and Indian Oceans and threaten India, which is one example. However, the country most threatened by Japan is Vietnam. If Japan controls China, it will be easy to nibble away at Vietnam. Japan has already begun preparing for the future, as there is an island facing Vietnam's Tonkin across the sea, south of British Hong Kong. This island is Hainan Island, which belongs to Guangdong Province in China. This island is a strategic location with winding harbors that can be used as a submarine base. It is only a few hours from the island to Vietnam. Japan has long coveted this island. Therefore, France should now cooperate with Britain and the United States and adopt a firm attitude towards Japan." (Central News Agency, 1st dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Massacre Innocents</h3>
<p>American Newspaper Condemns Sternly</p>
<p>[Washington] An editorial in the Washington Daily News on the 21st strongly condemned Japan's massacre of innocent people and disregard for humanity, using unusually harsh language. It stated that the focus of Britain's strong protest to Japan is the Japanese army's wanton massacre of innocent people, as exemplified by the recent indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Shanghai's Nanshi and the Beijing-Hangzhou area. The injury to the British ambassador is only one aspect. Such behavior, which disregards humanity and violates international law, is a symbol of barbarism and cruelty. Yet Japan still considers itself among civilized nations, making it a laughingstock to the world. Such illegal and inhumane behavior is tantamount to a suicidal policy, because when Japan itself is bombed in the future, it will see that what it does not want done to itself, others will do to it.

<h3>Little Entente Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Soviet-Czech Mutual Assistance Pact Fully Endorsed by Romania</p>
<p>⊙Sinaia, Romania The standing political conference of the Little Entente concluded today after meeting yesterday. A communiqué was issued, stating the following three points: ㊀ The three countries of the Little Entente remain steadfast in their adherence to the Covenant of the League of Nations; ㊁ The three countries of the Little Entente desire that the countries of the Danube River basin completely resolve their suspicions and discord; ㊂ The three countries of the Little Entente believe that the general situation in Europe has indeed improved. According to informed sources in Romania, the Italian envoy to Romania has recently held talks with the authorities of the Little Entente countries, especially with Southern Prime Minister Стоядинович, in an attempt to persuade the Little Entente to advocate at Geneva for the recognition of Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia. Although the conference communiqué makes no mention of this, it is reported that the standing political conference has decided to adopt a wait-and-see attitude and act in concert with France and Britain. Romanian Foreign Minister 恩多奈斯哥 recently made a statement to the press, stating that Romania's relations with France are friendly, and regarding the Soviet-Czech mutual assistance pact, he said that the Romanian government fully endorses it.

<p>[Jinan] The Zhengjia Temple on the south bank of the embankment in Putai County, downstream of the Yellow River in Shandong Province, suddenly developed a new danger on the evening of the 28th. The water was four to five zhang deep. The embankment collapsed for a length of 2,000 meters in two days. Although materials were gathered and over 10,000 soldiers, personnel, and civilians rescued day and night, the water was too strong, and it finally breached at 11:46 AM on the 28th. The breach was about 1,000 meters wide, and the floodwaters flowed eastward along the old course of the Wangjia Yuan and Zaozi Liu breaches from the spring of the 17th year [of the Republic], heading towards Yangjia Gully and into the sea. The area affected, from the breach to the sea, is over a hundred li long, and includes the borders of Guangrao, Bo, Putai, and Jishou Guang counties. Fortunately, it is mostly sandy and sparsely populated, so the disaster is not too severe. Wang Kairu, director of the river defense bureau, considering his responsibility, telegraphed Chairman Han and Kong Xiangrong separately, expressing his willingness to be punished and awaiting instructions.

<h3>Yu Fu River, a Tributary of the Yellow River in Shandong Province, Floods Jinan</h3>
<p>Villages from North of the City to Luokou Are Gone The River Defense Bureau Actively Works to Close the Breach</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence On the 12th of this month, the Yu Fu River, a tributary of the Yellow River, breached its banks in Changqing. The water overflowed, and from 4 or 5 PM that afternoon until 4 or 5 AM the next morning, Jinan was flooded. The entire northern commercial district was flooded, and half the city became a swamp. The industrial area around Guanzha Camp was completely submerged. Villages for dozens of li from north of the city to Luokou were gone. Tens of thousands of refugees have been added. There is currently no prospect of closing the breach. Even if it is closed, the refugees have no clothes or food, how can they survive? It is truly worrying.</p>
<p>Wang Kairu, director of the Shandong River Defense Bureau, is actively working on the project to close the breach in the Yu Fu River. The following is the text of the director's report to the provincial government: "Regarding the progress of the work to close the breach in the Yu Fu River, I have telegraphed reports several times. Since the start of the work to close the breach until now, the north embankment has progressed a total of 22 meters in length and 12 meters in width, and the south embankment has progressed a total of 11 meters in length and varies from 12 to 13 meters in width. There are still 62 meters remaining in the main breach. As for the north and south coffer dams, they are being rushed day and night. The north coffer dam has been extended to over 170 meters in length and about 13 meters in width, and the south coffer dam has been extended to 37 meters in length and varies from 13 to 37 meters in width. The coffer dam is estimated to be three-fifths complete. The shape of the breach has not changed significantly. In addition to supervising the soldiers and personnel to advance vigorously, I hereby report, Shandong River Defense Bureau Director Wang Kairu, bowing and submitting seal,"</p>
<h3>Siam Strictly Maintains Neutrality</h3>
<p>[Singapore] According to Siamese political figures, Siam will maintain a strict neutral attitude towards the Sino-Japanese conflict. The assertion that Japan occupies an extremely important position in Siam's political and economic affairs has been strongly denied by these figures. It is claimed that Siam originally imported a large amount of Japanese goods, but this has recently been replaced by European goods. Although the Sino-Japanese conflict has no impact on Japanese-Siamese relations, Siam will henceforth rely entirely on European countries for its purchases. (1st dispatch from Haitong)</p>

<h3>British Merchants Resume Navigation of North and South Ocean Routes</h3>
<p>Swire Sends Seven Ships, Jardine Matheson Sends Four Ships Operate to Shanghai, Qingdao, Yantai, Tianjin, Swatow, Hong Kong, and Canton</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th battle, Chinese and foreign shipping companies in Shanghai all sent their North and South Ocean vessels to Hong Kong. Within the Yangtze River line, navigation initially continued to the Jinghan section, but after the 16th, it was also announced to be suspended. Ships were concentrated in Hankou, and all traffic on the Jianghai routes was completely cut off. On the 26th of last month, Japan announced the blockade of the Chinese coast. British merchant ships in Shanghai, such as Swire and Jardine Matheson, upon Japanese claims that there were no obstacles for third-country vessels, cabled to Hong Kong, discussing resuming</p>
<p>Coastal Navigation of North and South Ocean Routes</p>
<p>As a result of the consultation, Swire dispatched the Shengjing, Shuntian, and Yuezhou, three ships, to operate on the Shanghai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Tianjin line. The Shengjing sailed north for the first time yesterday, carrying 229 boxes of tea from Shanghai. This is the first batch of goods transported north after the war. The Shuntian is scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 7th. Four ships, Jinan, Niuzhuang, Guangzhou, and Sichuan, have been assigned to the South China line. Starting tomorrow, the Jinan will begin sailing to Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Canton, roughly twice a week. Jardine Matheson's first ship, Lisheng, will</p>
<p>Sail to Swatow, Hong Kong, and Canton</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow. Ship Dingsheng will continue to sail on the 3rd, also to South China. Ship Fusheng will sail on the 4th, bound for Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian, and Tianjin in the North Ocean. Ship Zesheng will sail on the 7th, bound for South China. Afterwards, the number of ships will be increased depending on business needs. Currently, the two companies have dispatched a total of eleven ocean-going vessels to maintain navigation on the North and South Ocean routes, with four ships temporarily operating on the North Ocean and seven ships sailing on the South Ocean. However, during this wartime period, all freight charges and water fees must be paid in cash and will be moderately increased.</p>
<p>According to the Shipping Industry</p>
<p>The South Ocean route mainly involves cargo for import, the most important of which is the supply of daily necessities for foreigners in Shanghai. Exports mainly involve passengers. As for the North Ocean route, there are tens of thousands of people waiting for ships to go south from Tianjin, and even more transferring to other transportation in Yantai and other places. A reporter asked a foreign merchant whether the Japanese navy, having announced the blockade of our coastline, might inspect British ships. The reply was that since Britain is not involved in the war and merchant ships are engaged in peaceful business, any third-country ships would be unwilling to be inspected. Moreover, British warships are stationed in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Liu Gong Island. Under these special circumstances, the navigation of British ships will certainly be protected at all times.</p>
<h3>Traitorous Merchants Should Be Punished For Supplying Beef to the Enemy</h3>
<p>Transporting Beef to Enemy Cold Storage Every Night Transporting A Large Quantity of Lian Xianzheng Each Time</p>
<p>Currently, traitorous merchants have been discovered in the city supplying beef to the enemy. To avoid public attention, a certain slaughterhouse first slaughters the cattle, then transports them to a certain beef shop. Then, the enemy sends trucks to pick them up during the nighttime curfew and stores them in the enemy's cold storage on Miller Road. Many have been transported in recent days. It is reported that Zhang Mujin, Fei Shaojin, Hu Xiaolong, Zhang Fujin, Gong Jiaqi, Tang Xianghe, and others in the cattle business were entrusted by Japanese individuals such as Mikasaya Shimizu to purchase large quantities of beef at high prices after the Lugouqiao Incident, up to hundreds of heads per day. The beef currently eaten by the enemy in Shanghai is the cattle supplied and stored by Zhang Mujin and others. The authorities are currently investigating this strictly.</p>
<h3>The Cilian Association Telegraphed to Request an Initial Allocation of 100,000 to Relieve Refugees</h3>
<p>The Refugee Relief Committee of the United Relief Association of Various Charitable Organizations stated that from the outbreak of the war to the present, in addition to those who have been sent away, there are still over 10,000 refugees being sheltered. The need for funds is urgent, and while people from all walks of life have generously donated, it is still far from sufficient. Moreover, as the war prolongs, more refugees will inevitably arrive, and it will be impossible to provide relief without large sums of money. Therefore, the vice chairmen of the association, Qu Wenliu, Wang Yiting, and Huang Manzhi, telegraphed Zhu Qinglan, chairman of the Relief Commission, requesting an initial allocation of 100,000 yuan to meet immediate needs.</p>
<h3>The Number of Ships Arriving in Shanghai Gradually Increases</h3>
<p>Two More Foreign Ships Enter the Port</p>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs resumed operations, the number of foreign merchant ships entering the port has gradually increased. This morning, the Jinan and Shenfu vessels entered the Wusong port one after another before 8 AM. Ship Shenfu continued to transport refugees from Ningbo and set sail for Ningbo yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Changes Curfew Hours</h3>
<p>Effective Tonight Curfew at 11:30 PM</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council announced a notice on the 17th of last month, stipulating that residents in the settlement must remain indoors from 10 PM to 5 AM the next morning. This regulation has now been adjusted by the Municipal Council, and from today (Thursday) until the Council provides further notice, the restricted hours will be changed to 11:30 PM to 5 AM the next morning. However, this measure is being implemented on a trial basis.</p>

<h3>The Bank of China Subscribes to 20 Million Yuan in National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Colleagues at Headquarters Bravely Purchase 140,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the issuance of the National Salvation Bonds, subscriptions from all sectors have been very enthusiastic. Various private groups and organizations have actively solicited subscriptions. Driven by patriotic fervor, employees of various organizations have also spontaneously launched joint subscriptions. The following information has been gathered:</p>
<p>Bank of China Organization</p>
<p>In addition to the Bank of China itself taking on 10 million yuan, it also took on the task of soliciting subscriptions from organizations such as the Construction Bank, Guangdong Bank, and China Insurance Company, totaling 20 million yuan. The breakdown is as follows: Bank of China 10 million yuan, Construction Bank 3 million yuan, Guangdong Bank 1 million yuan, China Insurance Company 1.5 million yuan, China Cotton Corporation 2 million yuan, Huainan Coal Mining Company 750,000 yuan, Yangtze Electric Company 750,000 yuan, South China Rice Corporation 500,000 yuan, Hankou Jiji Water and Electricity Company 250,000 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company 250,000 yuan, totaling 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Bank of China Colleagues</p>
<p>The Bank of China colleagues have also taken the initiative to organize and formulate methods for soliciting subscriptions from colleagues. Except for those with lower salaries, who can exercise discretion, all other colleagues are required to donate at least one month's salary, with larger donations welcome. Some have even transferred all of their usual savings to purchase National Salvation Bonds. As of recently, colleagues at the headquarters alone have donated 140,000 yuan. It is reported that Chairman Song Ziwen subscribed to 50,000 yuan, General Manager Song Hanzhang 21,000 yuan, Feng Youwei 10,500 yuan, Wang Baolun 2,500 yuan, Wang Lengbo 10,700 yuan, Dai Zhiqian 1,500 yuan, Huo Yamin 1,400 yuan, Wang Zihong 1,500 yuan, Xia Pingfang 1,000 yuan, and Bian Fusun 1,000 yuan. The names of other colleagues cannot be listed in full and will be reported later. It is expected that the amount of donations from colleagues at other branches will arrive gradually, and the amount should be even more impressive.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds Shanghai Solicitation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Team of the Solicitation Committee Holds Meeting</p>
<p>The Local Association is Hired to Serve as the Head of the Team Hope That the Gentry and the Wealthy and Foreign Currency Depositors Will Strive to Contribute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association was hired by the General Assembly of the National Salvation Bonds Solicitation Committee to serve as the Shanghai Municipal Citizen Solicitation Team. A meeting was held yesterday, attended by Team Leader Du Yuesheng, Deputy Team Leaders Qian Xinzhi and Wang Xiaolai, Honorary Team Leader Yu Qiaqing, and the heads of various groups, totaling over fifty people. Team Leader Du presided over the meeting and gave a speech, stating that since Japan's invasion of Jicha, Songhu has suffered damage. The government, in order to consolidate national defense and protect the people, has issued 500 million yuan in National Salvation Bonds to finance national defense military expenditures. All of you are social leaders with ardent patriotism and will certainly do your best to solicit subscriptions, concentrate people's wealth, and strengthen combat power. The survival of the nation depends on this one move. I sincerely hope that you will redouble your efforts to help fulfill the national duty. Then, the team's articles of association were approved (the articles are recorded later). It was resolved to ask each group to quickly establish sub-teams to widely solicit subscriptions from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, with particular emphasis on the gentry and the wealthy and those with foreign currency deposits, in order to easily accumulate large amounts. It is also hoped that citizens of this city who know the names, addresses, and property amounts of the gentry and the wealthy, or the amounts of foreign currency held, will provide detailed listings without needing to provide their names, and send them to the Shanghai Citizen Solicitation Team of the Local Association, so that subscriptions can be solicited. It is heard that some members of the gentry and the wealthy in this city have already reported their subscription amounts to the team, which is a sign of public spirit. The team should publicize this as an encouragement.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds Shanghai Solicitation</h3>
<p>Team Articles of Association</p>
<p>㊀ The Shanghai Local Association, hired by the General Assembly of the National Salvation Bonds Solicitation Committee, establishes the Shanghai Municipal Citizen Solicitation Team. ㊁ The team is led by a team leader, who is the chairman of the Local Association. There are two deputy team leaders, who are the two vice chairmen of the Local Association. There is also one honorary team leader and two honorary deputy team leaders, who are invited from among the citizens with wealth and reputation. ㊂ The team is divided into eight groups: (1) General Affairs Group, (2) City Area Group, (3) First Special Zone Group, (4) Second Special Zone Group, (5) Native Place Association Group, (6) Gentry and Wealthy Group, (7) Women's Group, (8) Freelance Profession Group. Each group is led by a director and several deputy directors, who are appointed by the team leader. Each of the aforementioned groups, except for the General Affairs Group, may establish solicitation sub-team leaders, who are appointed by the team leader. ㊃ In order to facilitate the work of each group, several staff members may be appointed. Each group nominates staff members, who are then appointed by the team by letter. ㊄ The work guidelines for each group will be determined separately. ㊅ All personnel in each group are volunteers and do not receive any salary. ㊆ Each group should report the solicitation results to the team daily. The team will then report to the Solicitation General Assembly. ㊇ The Solicitation Team has an office in the Local Association. Each group may choose its own office based on the convenience of the work. ㊈ These articles of association will be implemented after being discussed and resolved by the team leader, deputy team leaders, and the directors of each group, and reported to the Solicitation Committee for record.</p>
<h3>Factory Investigation During Emergency Period</h3>
<p>Organized by the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in this city, many factories have been forced to shut down because their factory sites have become war zones, their sources of raw materials have been cut off, or their capital turnover is sluggish. At the beginning of this resistance war, rear production is extremely important. In order to understand the situation of factories during this emergency period, the Social Affairs Bureau of this city has specially prepared an investigation form, printed and prepared by the Shen Bao. The bureau has instructed various domestic goods factory associations to notify all factories in this city, regardless of whether they were previously registered or are currently closed, to fill out the form in detail according to the format from now until September 10th and send it to Mr. Xiang Zhuanggu, 4 Weida Lane, Lafayette Road, Second Special Zone (requests by mail are also accepted).</p>
<h3>French Concession Restricts Newspaper Vendors</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident occurred, the French Concession authorities have adopted various measures to prevent the publication of inaccurate news in this city that would disrupt order within the concession. Only major newspapers are allowed to circulate in the French Concession, and various small newspapers with inconsistent sources of information have been temporarily banned from sale. Now, because there are too many newspaper vendors on various roads shouting loudly, which is detrimental to public safety, the following regulations for restricting newspaper sales are specified: Newspaper vendors who sell newspapers in the French Concession must register with the French Concession Police Department and obtain a badge authorizing them to sell newspapers before they are allowed to sell. The badges will be numbered and stamped by the French Concession Police Department. The number of approved vendors is 220. However, these newspaper vendors are still not allowed to shout loudly, but are only allowed to call out the name of the newspaper, and they are not allowed to solicit sales on various public transportation vehicles, which would obstruct traffic. If the above regulations are violated, the offending newspaper vendor will be taken to the police station, and the badge will be confiscated. As for the newspaper couriers employed by newspaper offices to deliver newspapers to subscribers by car, they are not subject to the above restrictions.</p>
<h3>Local Organizations Suggest Issuing Token Vouchers</h3>
<p>Lake Society Petitions for Issuance of National Circulation Vouchers; Silk Industry Association Requests Shanghai Commercial Vouchers</p>
<p>The Lake Society of this city, considering that since the outbreak of the war, finances have dried up and all industries have stalled, and if no measures are taken to provide relief, the rear may collapse, has specially petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Government to request the central government to issue circulation vouchers. The main points of the original petition are excerpted below: ㊀ Circulation vouchers can alleviate the shortage of banknotes and are specifically for domestic circulation, differing in nature from formal banknotes, but can still resist foreign exchange. Banknotes must have reserve funds, while circulation vouchers use goods as reserves, to be issued by the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank. ㊁ Most state-run industrial and commercial operators in our country do not have sufficient capital, and rely on loans from special banks and money shops for support. Now, with the shortage of legal tender and financial stagnation, those with savings cannot withdraw them, let alone borrow, which will leave the industrial and commercial sectors with goods they cannot sell and raw materials they cannot use. After the issuance of circulation vouchers, the industrial and commercial sectors can mortgage goods at appraised values, with low interest rates and long terms, allowing factories and businesses to prepare leisurely and operate to the fullest extent, with some hope of revival. (Three) With the outbreak of war, industry and commerce have shut down, and the number of unemployed is no less than tens of millions. The strong become bandits, and the old and weak end up in ditches. How can the order of the rear be maintained? After the issuance of circulation vouchers, finance will circulate, industry and commerce will revive, the unemployed will be relieved, and society will be stabilized. ㊃ Circulation vouchers are fully used and valid nationwide, regardless of provincial boundaries, but cannot be exchanged for legal tender. Denominations include one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, and one hundred yuan. Movable and immovable property and all goods accepted as collateral will serve as reserves for the vouchers. Mortgaged items will be publicly appraised at market prices and fully collateralized. The term is tentatively set at one to five years, with an annual interest rate of four percent. A review committee will be formed to inspect the items, appraise their market prices, and a custody committee will be formed to safeguard the goods.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Association yesterday drafted key measures for issuing wartime Shanghai commercial vouchers and sent them to the two city chambers of commerce, requesting them to suggest the following measures to the authorities: ㊀ These commercial vouchers are purely issued by the Shanghai business community to cope with the wartime shortage of legal tender for market circulation. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce should draft detailed methods, submit them to the Ministry of Finance for approval, and the city chamber of commerce should jointly prepare a reserve with the money shops to be responsible for issuance. ㊁ These commercial vouchers will be in denominations of one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. ㊂ These commercial vouchers will circulate in the market, regardless of the duration, without interest. ㊃ Method of use: Stores and firms that use the vouchers must prepare reliable guarantees. After applying to the joint reserve of money shops and obtaining agreement, they may sign a usage contract, and an anti-counterfeiting mark must be stamped on the voucher before it can be used. ㊄ These commercial vouchers are limited to circulation in Shanghai and are fully usable in the same way as legal tender. ㊅ User states should prepare the same number of commercial vouchers or legal tender within six months of use to return the guarantees to the issuing agency. ㊆ These commercial vouchers may not be exchanged for legal tender or other auxiliary currencies from the issuing agency, but self-exchange in the market is not subject to this rule.</p>
<h3>Propagating the National Crisis</h3>
<p>Thunder and Lightning Theater Troupe Departs for South China; Snow Society Broadcasts National Defense Dramas</p>
<p>The Zhabei Thunder and Lightning Theater Troupe of this city, since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, has seen its members scattered and all troupe affairs have come to a standstill. Recently, the person in charge of the troupe, Ma Ling, considering the severity of the national crisis and the commencement of the full-scale war of resistance, and the importance of drama in propaganda, gathered more than ten theater people of conscience in Shanghai, including Song An, Lin Fei, Chen Kangran, and Zhu Banren, to reorganize and continue the theatrical movement, and deliberately renamed it the Thunder and Lightning Theater Team. They plan to depart for various places in the South in the coming days to propagate the national crisis and organize the people to resist the enemy for a long time and achieve final victory. It is reported that the team's office is currently temporarily located at 162 Foch Road in the French Concession. The Snow Society in this city is engaged in rescue work in a rather intense manner. In addition to organizing a wartime service group and a comfort team, the drama department will broadcast national defense dramas such as 'Our Hometown,' 'The Night Before,' and 'Roaring Hebei' from 2:00 pm every day starting on the 4th of this month, from the China and Overseas Radio Station (1260 kHz), to carry out salvation propaganda. The Literature and Art Department also began publishing the 'Cold Friend Extraordinary Bi-monthly' from the 6th, with rich content, beautiful style, and novel themes, with particular emphasis on anti-war comics. It is reported that each issue sells for only two French cents.</p>
<h3>Overseas Students Studying in the U.S. Surely Expect to Depart</h3>
<p>More than two hundred students studying in the United States in this class, previously due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, all foreign ships competed to transport foreigners away from Shanghai, causing the students studying in the United States to temporarily postpone their departure. Subsequently, after proper negotiations between the student representatives and the Ta Lai Company, it was decided to take the President Hoover and President McKinley, which sailed to Shanghai on the 30th and 31st of last month, to the United States. When the President Hoover arrived at the mouth of the Songjiang River, it was accidentally bombed, causing the ship to sail directly to Japan and return to the United States. The President McKinley also did not stop when it passed through Shanghai before, causing the departure of the students studying in the United States to be postponed again. Considering this, the students studying in the United States again dispatched representatives to contact the Changxing Shipping Company, requesting that the company's Empress of Canada ship carry them to the United States when it arrives in Shanghai on the 5th of this month. It is now heard that the representative responsible for the negotiations is scheduled to report on the negotiation process and other important matters at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 10:00 am tomorrow. It is hoped that all students studying in the United States will attend on time.</p>
<h3>City Federation Wartime Service Council Held Fourth Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Citizen Federation of the First Special District of this city held its fourth Wartime Service Committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Zhang Yichen. The matters resolved were: ㊀ The Federation now plans to first organize the patrol teams on Nanjing Road and other fourteen roads to maintain order, and scheduled a discussion meeting with the responsible persons of the sub-districts on the afternoon of September 3rd at 2:00 pm to plan everything. ㊁ The Federation advocated using national salvation bonds to pay rent. In addition to writing to the Real Estate Association, it should also immediately instruct the sub-districts to earnestly persuade tenants. ㊂ Committee member Wang Zhaocheng proposed that those who purchase national salvation bonds in amounts of more than ten thousand yuan should be rewarded by the General Association in accordance with separate regulations to show encouragement.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Proposes to Stop the Opening of Entertainment Venues</h3>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai yesterday proposed to the Anti-Enemy Support Association to stop the opening of entertainment venues. The original text states: "It has been found that many entertainment venues are enthusiastically serving as refugee shelters. Recently, it has been reported that dance halls are raising funds in name only, and some are even opening, which is truly being blinded by greed and shows no conscience. A group of dancers are even more frantic and stupid as cold-blooded animals. They should be strictly ordered to stop, and instead be held responsible for running hospitals or refugee shelters. If they refuse, they should be punished." Today, the military representatives of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang United Office all expressed their indignation and were very vehement. There are also reports that donations to the Support Association and local associations were not approved in advance, which constitutes fraudulent behavior and should be questioned in a special letter and dealt with accordingly, without leniency.</p>
<h3>Refugees from Danger in Hongkou Provided with Shelter in Reception Centers</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the City Relief Committee rescued approximately 2,000 refugees from danger in Hongkou. Yesterday morning, more than 200 people were rescued, and the committee added nine reception centers to house them separately. The five reception centers are: ㊀ Daguanlou (Shilu) ㊁ Ya Lou (Sima Road), Quanminle (near Father Bisi Road) ㊃ Hongyunlou (Avenue Edward VII), ㊄ Yiyuan (opposite the Far East at the Racecourse).</p>
<h3>There is No Interruption in the Water Supply in the Concession</h3>
<p>Everything is Normal Now; Residents Can Rest Assured</p>
<p>Recently, due to the impact of the war, floating corpses have been found in the Huangpu River from time to time. Residents are deeply concerned about the turbidity of the tap water. However, according to the report of the Chief of the Health Department of the Public Works Bureau, the supply of tap water is as usual, and residents can rest assured. The office said that since the change of the situation, the quality of tap water has always maintained its usual high standard, and cases of residents suffering from gastrointestinal diseases are quite rare. This shows that the tap water company's clarification pond has not been affected, and its function is still as usual. Eighteen days have passed since the outbreak of the Shanghai War. During this period, the tap water required by users has been supplied continuously, and its pressure and quality have not changed. Although the machinery used by the tap water company has been damaged occasionally, it is insignificant. The water pipes in various places have been repaired on time, and the Public Works Bureau has decided on emergency supply measures in order to be cautious, so that users can still have a source of water in case the water source is affected. But in fact, there is no possibility of the water source being cut off.</p>
<h3>There is No Need to Worry About the Fuel Supply; Coal Briquette Factories Will Start Work Immediately</h3>
<p>The Regulated Price is $1.60 Per Load</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the coal briquette manufacturing factories, which are the main fuel for Shanghai residents, are located on the front lines, resulting in a lack of supply and causing great panic. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has separately ordered six factories, including Zhonghua, to start work immediately and continue manufacturing to meet the needs, and has restricted the price to $1.60 per load as the standard to meet the needs of residents. The bureau issued a notice yesterday, which stated, "It has been found that coal briquettes are a daily necessity for residents. Since the war, the manufacturers have all suspended operations, interrupting production, which is not appropriate. The Bureau has considered the local production and sales situation and has ordered factories such as Zhonghua Factory, Nanyang Factory, Hezhong Factory, Guohua Factory, Dongfang Factory, and Huanan Factory to start work as soon as possible and continue manufacturing to meet the needs of the people. The price per load is $1.60 as the standard. In addition to ordering the industry association to comply with it, the Municipal Police Bureau is also instructed to protect it properly."</p>
<h3>Aviation Lottery Prizes Will Still Be Paid Out as Usual</h3>
<p>The Aviation Highway Construction Lottery has been issued for 38 periods since its inception. Because of its reliable credit, it has been popular with the public. Recently, since the Shanghai War, a few people have questioned whether the winning tickets can be redeemed as scheduled. A reporter from the newspaper went to the office to inquire in order to understand the truth. According to the person in charge, the prize money for each period has always been deposited in the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Communications Bank before the redemption, and has never been changed. It should be known that the construction lottery is founded by the state and has a long-standing reputation. No matter what the situation, the redemption procedure will be handled in accordance with the usual practice and will never be changed due to the war. The reporter then inquired with the three banks and learned that the banks are currently paying out prizes as usual, and confirmed that the statements made by the office spokesperson are indeed true. Those in society who have doubts about this lottery can now rest assured.</p>
<h3>Minhang District Chief Arrested</h3>
<p>Wu Shilao, the chief of the Minhang District Office in Shanghai County, was summoned and detained by the county government yesterday morning, and was sent to the Songjiang Commissioner's Office for interrogation on the same day. As for the reason for the arrest, it is said that in this extremely tense period, Wu failed to maintain local order and was absent from the county government meeting, so it was suspected that he had deserted in the face of the enemy.</p>
<h3>Fire at Datongmen in Nanshi Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>At about 1:10 pm yesterday afternoon, the skylight awning in front of Heyuan Nanhuo Store at No. 180 Zhonghua Road, at the intersection of Xianzhua Street outside Datongmen in Nanshi, suddenly caught fire for unknown reasons. The fire then spread to the adjacent stores on the left and right, Jichun Longan Store and Guangshengyuan Candy Store, and the fire became uncontrollable. Upon hearing the alarm, the fire brigades from various districts in Nanshi rushed to the scene and fought bravely to put out the fire. It was not until about half an hour later that the fire was extinguished.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Discusses the Use of National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Purchasing Public Bonds Strengthens the Foundation of the Country and Ensures That It Will Not Be Forced to Its Knees</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Salvation Bonds Solicitation Committee, issued a statement yesterday, saying that recent newspapers had mistakenly reported that he had said that the national salvation bonds were entirely for national defense military use. Song Ziwen declared that this report was incorrect, because the purpose of the national salvation bonds was purely to provide general funds for the government, similar to the nature of other public bonds. At this time of extreme national crisis, all of our citizens hope to fulfill their duties to the government, and this is almost the same mentality. The government is now issuing 500 million yuan in public bonds, which are named national salvation bonds, aiming to arouse the sympathy of the people and also to provide everyone with an opportunity to serve the country. In fact, the facts tell us that it is sufficient to prove that in a country without a strong government, the lives, property, and freedom of its people are absolutely not guaranteed. Our compatriots should purchase national salvation bonds, which means jointly building a strong national foundation, ensuring that we will not be forced to our knees. Furthermore, this public bond is issued at face value, with a weekly interest rate of 4%, which is relatively low compared to the interest rates of other public bonds. However, the spirit of sacrifice of our country and nation for the general purchase will always be remembered and cannot be erased.

<h3>Our Troops' Position in Luodian is Consolidated; Enemy Troops in Wusong Advance on All Routes</h3>
<p>Tongji University Bombed by the Enemy; No Trace of the Enemy in Shizilin, Baoshan</p>
<p>Between last night and this morning, enemy troops at Paotaiwan, Wusong Town south to Yunzaobang, Zhanghuabang and other places launched fierce attacks on our troops' positions at the cost of great sacrifices. Our troops also responded with concentrated firepower. The sounds of guns and cannons did not cease all night. The target of the enemy's naval artillery fire was concentrated in the area near Tongji University and Yanghang. After dawn this morning, more than ten enemy planes came again to bomb and assist in the battle, so Tongji University has been almost completely destroyed. Moreover, enemy troops have arrived near the school at more than 9:00 am today. Our troops are still strictly guarding the line in Yanghang. The area from Baoshan to Shizilin is still our troops' position. Although the enemy has repeatedly attacked, they have never succeeded. The enemy troops in Luodian are still surrounded by our large army. According to a war report received by a military agency this morning, ㊀ The enemy troops who landed at Qiujiang Pier yesterday (1st) attacked our Guanyintang position. After failing, they are now still retreating to their original position and dare not attack again. ㊁ In the Wusong area, after our troops launched a fierce attack last night, they have now completed a large encirclement. It is expected that hundreds of remaining enemies in the area can be completely resolved today. ㊂ In Luodian, our troops fiercely advanced from Changqiao last night, and are now two or three miles away from the river. The remaining enemy troops have lost their ability to resist, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them all in the next day or two.</p>
<h3>Enemy at Zhanghuabang Stubbornly Resist</h3>
<p>Since enemy reinforcements successively landed in Wusong Town, they have attacked our Baoshan County under the cover of enemy planes and enemy ships, trying to break through the encirclement and make contact with the enemy in Luodian. Our troops were prepared early, and the enemy's repeated attacks were repelled. Now the enemy is entrenched east of the railway line in the Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, and Wusong Town areas, stubbornly resisting, and it is learned that the enemy has built a floating pier as long as one mile there, in order to continuously land troops.</p>
<h3>Enemy in Shanghai East Hongkou Attempt to Defend Stubbornly</h3>
<p>Confirmed information, the enemy's defense works in Yangshupu, Broadway Road, Outer Hongqiao, Wusong Road, Haibin Road, Miller Road, Minhang Road, Dongxi Huade Road and other places, after being automatically set on fire when they were collected and retreated a few days ago, are now being arranged by their reinforcements, and because of the lack of yellow sand, there is no way to pile sandbags, so they are digging soil and gravel on the open spaces in the area to pile up. At the more important streets, iron wire currents are laid, and machine guns are set up in all the stronger buildings for defense. Seeing this, the enemy troops in the area seem to have the intention of resisting stubbornly for a long time.</p>
<p>Inside the Ritongxing Yarn Factory, No. 2086, Linqing Road, Yangshupu Road, the enemy is engaged in setting up another army headquarters to specifically direct its army's operations. Now the factory has been transporting a large number of munitions and food in recent days, and special guards are in place in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Central News Agency said that the enemy in Yangshupu Hongkou, with the help of the army, launched a counterattack against us again from last night to this morning. The enemy ships in the river frequently bombarded with heavy artillery for cover. The artillery fire was concentrated on the Beihuo Railway Station. Our ×× artillery positions also returned fire with artillery. In Yangshupu, we densely fired with rifles and machine guns. The fierce battle lasted all night, and the enemy did not succeed. The sound of guns gradually became sparse until dawn.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Also Destroys Cultural Institutions</h3>
<p>Tongji University Has Been Destroyed; Declares War on World Culture</p>
<p>The National Tongji University, located in Wusong, has been repeatedly reconnaissance by enemy aircraft since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, hoping to destroy it. However, in order to focus on dealing with the Zhabei war, they only added bombardment with naval guns. Until this time, when the enemy reinforcements arrived and the whole plan was to land in Wusong and other places, they concentrated artillery fire on the school in the event of a battle failure. On the 28th and 29th, they bombed all the school's buildings all day with airplanes dropping bombs. Now, almost all of them have been destroyed, especially the buildings with large earthworks such as the auditorium, the training factory, and the student dormitory. The survey and navigation museum, which has not yet been completed, has also been bombed. It has been found that the school is located far north of Wusong Town, and is not important militarily. Even our army has no actual use of the school for combat. The enemy's destruction in this way is not a planned conspiracy, who can believe it? It has been heard that since the outbreak of the war, the destruction of cultural education institutions has been the enemy's entire plan. The school has moved various mechanical instruments, books, and files to a safe area. In addition, this practical university, which has a history of several decades and is quite famous at home and abroad, has shared the same fate as Nankai University in Tianjin and Pingjin. The enemy's intentional destruction of cultural construction is tantamount to the actual combat of the entire world culture, and the vicious face is exposed more clearly.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Gather in Wusong and Liuhe</h3>
<p>In recent days, most of the enemy ships docked in Shanghai have gathered in the Wusong and Liuhe areas, while leaving a small number of enemy ships to cruise in the Huangpu River as a cover for their rear in Hongkou and Yangshupu. At 1:10 am today, in addition to one enemy gunboat entering, two destroyers, one transport ship, and one gunboat also departed. In total, there are eleven Japanese ships moored in the river today. The distribution is as follows: One destroyer at Mitsubishi Pier 16, one destroyer at Floating Pontoon 1, one destroyer at Floating Pontoon 6, 7, 10, 13, 15, and 17, and one gunboat at Floating Pontoon 22 and 35. As for the enemy flagship Izumo, which plans the enemy's military operations, it is still berthed at Floating Pontoon 2.</p>
<h3>Our Troops and Enemy Ships Bombard Each Other</h3>
<p>Public Works Bureau intelligence, yesterday (1st) night, Chinese troops near a certain place opened fire and fired at Japanese ships in the Huangpu River. Field artillery fired at Japanese ships on the side. In addition to returning fire, Japanese ships fired at Pudong and Beihuo Railway Station. The fighting with rifles and machine guns in the Yangshupu area did not stop until 3:00 am. The battle site was approximately north of the police station. At 4:30, a heavy artillery shell exploded about 300 yards behind the North Station. There were also artillery shells about one mile west of North Xizang Road. These shells appeared to have been fired from warships in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>At about 6:00 am this morning, a shell fell at the intersection of Yichang Road and Gordon Road, injuring two Chinese (male). Also, there was artillery fire near Baoshan Road between 8:00 and 10:00.</p>
<p>The Japanese ships on the Pujiang surface east of Hongkou bombarded the Pudong area with heavy artillery again at about 3:00 am this morning, for more than seven consecutive shots.</p>
<h3>Our Plainclothes Team Attacks the Enemy Camp Fiercely</h3>
<p>Operated in the North Sichuan Road Area; The Enemy Suffered Countless Casualties and Enormous Losses</p>
<p>According to confirmed information, at about 9:00 pm last night, our plainclothes team suddenly appeared in the North Sichuan Road area and launched a fierce attack on the enemy's rear position. The enemy was caught off guard and immediately mobilized the armored vehicle team and fired machine guns indiscriminately. Seeing that the enemy was in chaos, our plainclothes team took the opportunity to advance towards Chongming Road on Wusong Road. At this time, the enemy's position rained down with hand grenades. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and huge losses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Transport Munitions to Shanghai Again</h3>
<p>Since the enemy troops repeatedly attacked our riverine ports and were repeatedly defeated by our troops, they spared no effort to commit their national elite forces to re-offend our borders. In addition to the reinforcements that have arrived in Shanghai one after another, the number of which has reached three divisions, they have also transported a large number of munitions. In addition to the Jian Fa Maru, Tian Xiang Maru, and Shanghai Maru, which had already completed their exports from the previous day, yesterday there was one enemy transport ship and one merchant ship, which also set sail this morning after unloading the munitions. Today, according to the reporter's investigation, there is another enemy merchant ship (the name is painted over) docked at the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. There are thirty to forty enemy troops unloading munitions, which is very busy. There are seven trucks parked at the wharf, ready to transport the munitions. In the past five days, the enemy has transported a total of seven ships of military equipment and munitions to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Seiyukai Demands That the Japanese Government Explain the Purpose of Using Troops in China</h3>
<p>And Establish a More Active Policy, Otherwise, the People May Have No Peaceful Days</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Seiyukai held a meeting today. The three leaders submitted a proposal, advocating that a detailed investigation be conducted into the government's purpose of using troops in China, and that the government's intentions be clarified. They also advocated finding a way for the government to clearly announce its purpose in China, and to establish a fundamental national policy based on its determined purpose. Otherwise, it would be difficult to have a satisfactory plan for the mobilization of troops, military operations, finance, and national economy, and the people's psychology would not have peaceful days. The above suggestions seem to have a sense of urgency, but it is said that the content is to demand that the government establish a more active policy towards China.

<h3>The "Shengjing" Hit Outside Wusongkou</h3>
<p>Tension in London</p>
<p>[London] According to a telegram from Shanghai, the British steamer "Shengjing" was struck by shrapnel on its deck when it arrived off Wusongkou. At the same time, the British destroyer "Harvester" was attacked in the Mediterranean by a submarine of unknown nationality. Upon hearing the news, people here were further shaken. It is reported that when the "Harvester" detected a submarine launching a torpedo at it, it immediately followed the Admiralty's instructions and retaliated with underwater bombs. Although government officials refused to comment on the matter, the "tension" in government circles was obvious. In addition, news vendors set up alarming signs in the main streets to express the outrage of ordinary people at the "piratical acts" in the Mediterranean.

<h3>Roosevelt Summons Naval Authorities</h3>
<p>Discusses Shanghai Situation</p>
<p>⊙Hyde Park President Roosevelt, currently on vacation here, recently summoned Rear Admiral Leahy, the Chief of Naval Operations, to discuss the situation in Shanghai. Afterwards, Navy Department personnel stated that the American warships in Shanghai were sufficient for evacuating僑民 and there was no need to send additional warships to assist. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the newspapers regarding the Shanghai war, stating that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, had advised American ships several days ago not to anchor in Shanghai. The situation in the Shanghai area remains the same, and it is still difficult to predict when American ships can resume docking in Shanghai. Regarding the evacuation of American 僑民 from Shanghai, Hull stated that the government had considered several plans, but no decision had been made yet. However, naval officials said that several U.S. warships would sail to Shanghai if necessary to evacuate僑民. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>The U.S. Maintains a Firm Attitude Towards the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>But Retains Flexibility in Actual Actions Roosevelt Remains Attentive to the Situation During Vacation</p>
<p>⊙Hyde Park President Roosevelt is currently resting in this area. Although on vacation, he is still paying close attention to the Far East situation and is in constant communication with Secretary of State Hull. Observers generally believe that the attitude adopted by Roosevelt and Hull towards the Far East situation is to maintain the most resolute attitude morally, while maintaining considerable flexibility in actual actions. Morally speaking, President Roosevelt has recently delivered speeches repeatedly, harshly condemning the ideologies of autocratic countries. Secretary of State Hull has also criticized the economic policies implemented by these countries, saying that the result is that world prosperity, which is a guarantee of world peace, cannot be restored. Hull also issued a written statement on July 16, revealing fourteen principles, saying they are necessary to maintain world peace and restore general prosperity. This statement is actually a kind of hint to various countries, but American public opinion may not be prepared to accept the reasonable consequences produced by these principles. In the American media, it is also believed that the world situation has fallen into a dilemma, and the United States must exhaust all methods to avoid being involved in the vortex of war. For example, newspaper commentary, even if extremely fierce, comes to the same conclusion, advising the American authorities to act cautiously, especially regarding the conflict between China and Japan. Public opinion also uses the passive attitude of the United Kingdom after the Mukden Incident as an excuse, and advocates that the United States should stay out of the matter. In a word, American public opinion agrees with the government's current attitude of positioning itself as a defender of international morality, but with the condition that American peace must not be hindered in any way.

<h3>Zhejiang Chairman Zhu Jiahua Comforts Soldiers</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Zhu Jiahua, seeing that since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai, our front-line soldiers have bravely fought against the enemy, fought bloody battles, and sacrificed for the country, working extremely hard, has specially purchased a large number of comfort items and sent Security Director Xuan Tiewu to represent him in comforting the front-line troops of all armies, to express his condolences.</p>
<h3>Britain Sends Four More Warships to the Mediterranean to Protect Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>Pursuing Submarines of Unknown Nationality France Suggests a Mediterranean Convention</p>
<p>⊙Gibraltar After the British destroyer Harvester was attacked by a submarine in Spanish waters, the destroyers "Hardy," "Hasty," "Hyperion," and "Hereward" were ordered to pursue this submarine of unknown nationality in the waters between Valencia and Alicante, Spain. British naval authorities here also told a Havas reporter that British warships in this port had been dispatched to protect British ships. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>[London] Incidents of submarines attacking ships of various countries in the Mediterranean have repeatedly occurred. The French government has therefore made a suggestion, advocating that countries along the Mediterranean coast establish a convention, so that when such incidents occur again, they can consult each other in order to deal with them jointly. British political figures originally thought that this proposal had the tendency to revive the Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement and might not be realized, but since the British destroyer Harvester was also attacked in Spanish waters, the proposal put forward by France has gradually taken shape. Political figures also advocate that when the League of Nations General Assembly meets in Geneva in the coming days, representatives of the Mediterranean coastal countries, namely Britain, France, Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Egypt, must take the opportunity to exchange opinions. It is expected that when the British Cabinet holds a meeting tomorrow, Foreign Secretary Eden, Lord Privy Seal Halifax, and Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore will all participate. At that time, this issue will definitely be discussed. In addition, British public opinion is also very angry about the submarine attack incidents, and all condemn it as "piracy." The Navy Department's instructions that British warships should not only retaliate immediately when such incidents occur, but also pursue the submarines, have been unreservedly supported by public opinion.

<h3>Colluding with Japanese Ronin to Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>Liu Bin and others Collude with Japanese and Korean Ronin, Disturbing Finance is Extremely Detestable</p>
<p>Five people, including Liu Bin, Zhou Yuqing, Yang Jingxian, Zhao Shusheng, and Jin Diqing, previously colluded with Japanese and Korean ronin, including Wataki Hideo and Tokuda Seiji, and seven or eight others, to counterfeit five-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China and banknotes of the Guangdong Provincial Bank. The case was cracked by the Public Concession Police, and they were arrested and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Special Court opened a court to continue the trial. He then ordered the start of the defense. According to the opinions of the police lawyers Ru Baoyi and Qian Xunjiu, the defendants in this case coveted petty profits, colluded with Japanese people to counterfeit national currency, disrupted finance, and undermined national credit. Moreover, during this emergency period, making this move is not only detestable but also extremely serious. Therefore, the court is requested to consider the evidence and sentence the defendants to the heaviest penalty separately, as a warning to future generations. After the defendants' lawyers debated, the court announced the end of the trial and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ships Resume North-South Routes</h3>
<p>Ningbo Refugees Continue to be Repatriated</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of various foreign shipping companies in Shanghai preparing to resume shipping routes, gradual progress has been seen. The Tai Gu Company's South China route, the "Jinan," entered port yesterday morning, unloaded a large number of goods, and is scheduled to transport goods to Hong Kong this afternoon, with a batch of refugees accompanying it to various ports in South China. Also, the company's "Wuhu" ship entered port this morning, but the Yangtze River route has been temporarily suspended. In addition, the North Ocean route's "Shuntian" ship is also about to enter port and is scheduled to depart on the 7th of this month. As for Jardine Matheson's resumption plan, it has also been agreed upon. Because the company's wharf is located in the Hongkou war zone, it is inconvenient for passengers and goods to board and disembark. Therefore, the Beijing Road wharf has been selected as a temporary stop. Today, the "Lisheng" and "Dingsheng" ships have successively resumed the South China route, departing for Guangdong and Hong Kong. The "Zesheng" ship is also scheduled to depart for Shantou on the 6th. Furthermore, on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, the "Shenfu" ship departed from Shanghai for Ningbo yesterday. This morning at 11:00, the "Xinshan" ship also departed for Ningbo. However, the ship was full of refugees from Ningbo, which was agreed upon by the Ningbo Association and the Shanghai Municipal Council. Observing this situation, except for the Yangtze River route, which is difficult to restore temporarily, the South China and North China routes are already showing a lively state with congested passengers and goods.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association, for the purpose of repatriating native refugees, rents ships daily for round-trip transportation. Yesterday, in addition to the Shenfu ship carrying passengers and departing for Ningbo, today the Longshan ship and the Mahle ship successively entered port, loading refugees. The association's shelter has now expanded to as many as eight locations. At the same time, the rescue team departs daily, and the current funds are handled by the members' advances. They are deeply afraid that it will become a chicken after a long time, so they specially divide and ask the Shanghai fellow countrymen to donate rescue funds, love the country and their hometown, and work together to create a grand event.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Devastates Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Many Chinese Sailors Die The Coastal Areas Present a Chaotic Scene</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] At two o'clock this morning, a typhoon passed through, with extreme force, unprecedented in many years, causing heavy losses, especially to the shipping industry. Various ships are anchored in the port here, including merchant ships that have taken refuge in Hong Kong due to Japan's blockade of the South China ports. Many ships have run aground, and many Chinese sailors have died. When the wind weakened slightly, the coastal areas presented an unprecedented chaotic scene. The wharves were completely destroyed, and the people in the small boats were obviously drowned, leaving only empty boats crashing into the coast in the wind and waves. There was also a lot of damage on the shore, with cars and trucks scattered on the road. Most of the storefronts were damaged, and all places showed a tragic scene of the typhoon. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Several distress telegrams from merchant ships outside the port have recently been received, reporting that they are experiencing high winds at sea. The Tai Gu Guangzhou ship ran aground south of Lema Island (transliteration), and telegraphed that the passengers and crew on board were safe, but urgently needed rescue. Also, the Tai Gu Shuntian ship ran aground in the southeast corner of Qingdao (transliteration), and telegraphed that the machinery could not be operated and assistance was needed immediately. In addition, there is a Chinese ship that is about to sink near Yuan Island, and a ship of unknown number has run aground in Guam (transliteration).

<h3>Erroneous Rumor that the Longshan Ship Leaving Port was Shelled by Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>The Italian merchant ship Longshan carried more than 2,000 Italian people from Shanghai to Ningbo a few days ago, and has safely arrived in Ningbo. The rumor that the ship was bombarded by enemy warships when it left the port is actually a false rumor according to the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association. The ship has now come to Shanghai from Ningbo and will arrive here soon to continue carrying refugees to Ningbo.</p>

<h3>Shipping Industry Cables Request to Negotiate Enemy Blockade of Southeast Coast</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, due to the illegal blockade of our Southeast coast by the enemy's Third Fleet, sent a cable to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The original cable reads: Nanjing respectfully presents to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Your Excellencies, Japan has not formally declared war on China, nor has it announced the severance of relations. The ambassadors of your country have not yet lowered their flags and returned home. However, the Third Fleet of that country has announced the blockade of our country's Southeast coast, which is a violation of international law. Our shipping merchants are the first to bear the brunt, and are unanimously indignant and will never yield. We should request that a serious protest be lodged with that country as soon as possible, and on the other hand, request that the international community make a fair judgment to uphold justice and stop the illegal actions. The Permanent Committee Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, Shen Zhongyi, and all member companies respectfully request,</p>
<h3>Short Commentary</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the only lesson we have learned is self-reliance and self-salvation. We will never hope that any friendly country will participate. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet conclusion of the non-aggression treaty is only to show sympathy in conscience, and there is absolutely no assistance in fact. This is what our external spokesperson has already stated. Therefore, the French newspaper commented on the Sino-Russian treaty, saying that it was like inserting a rocket on the head of a wild bull. In fact, this kind of treaty is not even considered inserting a rocket. Although the wild bull has seen this rocket, it has not yet reached its head. However, a wild bull is always a wild bull. Even if it is stuck on its head, it probably won't shout in pain. The so-called "never give up until one reaches the Yellow River."</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Mood in the Rear Area Amidst the War of Resistance (4)</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Deng Hanxiang's Speech</p>
<p>Sichuan currently has two major political affairs: the disaster relief issue and the military reorganization issue. Sichuan Province ordered a spring drought disaster, with an area covering more than 130 counties and about 30 million disaster victims, which can be regarded as a catastrophe after the wars in Sichuan Province. Moreover, Sichuan has always been known as a province with many soldiers, the military system is complex, and the awareness of discipline is poor. For the responsibilities that should be fulfilled, there are often flaws that cannot be concealed. This time, the authorities of various military systems were able to handle the two major events of military reorganization and disaster relief to a relatively satisfactory result with the greatest effort in a difficult environment, without any unexpected adverse effects. This is truly the blessing of Sichuan, and even more so the good fortune of China.</p>
<p>When I went to the Provincial Government to visit Chairman Liu Xiang, I was first received by Chief Secretary Deng Mingjie (Hanxiang). He said with a smile that Chairman Liu was currently discussing important matters with the military reorganization generals and that another letter would be required to arrange a face-to-face meeting. Then he answered the questions I asked. The following is a summary of the records:</p>
<p>Liu said that this time Sichuan is implementing military reorganization in accordance with the central plan, with the aim of enriching the units of the organization to meet the needs of national defense. Chairman Liu and the various army commanders have unanimously agreed to reorganize all the Sichuan-Kang armies into "reorganized divisions" within a month (by the end of August). The degree of enrichment of its content is about the original military quota of fortune, and now it is actually compiled into two fortunes. It is expected that there will be about 5,000 surplus military officers, and after consideration of back wages, they will be dismissed and returned to the fields separately. As for the North China issue, it is obviously a planned and step-by-step large-scale invasion by the Japanese. We have no other option but to resist the war. At present, the military reorganization work in Sichuan is nearing completion. The autumn harvest of rice in various counties can be more than 70%. For all the responsibilities that our Sichuan Province should fulfill to the country, such as ㊀ listening to the adjustment of the teachers to the front line, ㊁ maintaining the rear governance and security of this province, and ㊂ supplying the material needs of the front line as much as possible, I all take responsible talk, and I have considerable strength and grasp, and I am willing to encourage fellow countrymen across the country together.</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Interview Record</p>
<p>Chairman Liu was indeed very busy and did not agree to an urgent meeting, but first sent a written statement. It roughly stated that the Sichuan army is large in quantity but lacks quality, which is an undeniable fact, and a thorough reorganization is necessary. Since the military reorganization conference agreed on various plans, the army commanders have been able to deeply appreciate the difficulties of the times and unanimously expressed their acceptance. I have repeatedly telegraphed to Chairman Chiang, who is responsible for the heavy task of pacifying Sichuan and Kang, expressing my firm determination to thoroughly implement the military reorganization. The national environment is dangerous, and without a unified and sound army, it is not enough to save the country and survive. If the Sichuan army is not actively reorganized and enriched, it will be difficult to adapt to the needs of national defense. Therefore, I am determined to make the greatest effort, no matter what dangers and difficulties, I must achieve the predetermined goal before I finish. Moreover, the situation in North China today is extremely dangerous, and the enemy has fully mobilized, and I am also determined to resist the war. Although Sichuan is in the rear, the various preparatory work must not be delayed. In short, all the human and financial resources of Sichuan can be contributed to the country. The army must go to the front line, and the people must respond in the rear. Internally and externally consistent, in order to fulfill the responsibilities that the people of Sichuan should fulfill. Wherever justice lies, I will not hesitate to go through fire and water. At present, in addition to actively engaging in military reorganization and various preparatory work, the most important thing is production and construction. The provincial government has begun to draft a three-year construction plan, and I am also determined to do my best to promote its realization.</p>
<p>I happened to encounter continuous rainy days in Sichuan, the low-lying roads in Chengdu were flooded like rivers, the Chengdu-Chongqing Road was not open to traffic, and the planes were temporarily grounded. Therefore, I could not leave Chengdu as scheduled, so I took the opportunity to visit Chairman Liu at his private residence in Sanduo Lane. The residence had several Chinese-style doors, lined up along the alley, and four or five soldiers guarded it, each wearing a broadsword and a box cannon. People entered the door and went around the corridor, and suddenly saw a tall Western-style building surrounded by trees, which was said to have been built and presented by General Yang Sen. After a while, Liu appeared in the living room and added this opinion to the written statement. Liu's opinion roughly stated that thousands of miles of rivers and mountains in North China, the 700-year-old cultural relics of the old capital, and the 4 million people of Pingjin should not be allowed to be trampled on arbitrarily by the iron hooves of the violent Japanese, as in the "September 18th" incident. Judging from the two speeches delivered by Chairman Chiang in Lushan, we know that our authorities have also made a painful decision, adhered to our position, and will never allow the violent acts of Japan to expand again. However, in order to obtain this minimum expectation, we must exhaust all the strength of the soldiers and civilians across the country to deal with the enemy. For this reason, I have telegraphed Chairman Chiang several times to ask for permission to resist the war, and have received approving replies. From a certain point of view, our preparations are still not enough, but the enemy's aggressive behavior of gaining an inch is approaching our vital interests step by step, and we must not relax any longer. We deeply believe that, under the leadership of the central government, we will hold on to the determination of "rather be a broken jade than a complete tile" and continue to resist the war for more than a year, and the god of final victory will wave to us.</p>
<p>Looking at the statements issued by the Sichuan authorities, their attitude of supporting the central government and launching a nationwide war of resistance has been consistent from beginning to end and is extremely firm.</p>

<h3>The Tragic Situation of Refugees at the South Station Being Bombed by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Reports on Refugee Relief Work</h3>
<p>More Than 340,000 People Have Been Sent Abroad</p>
<p>According to news from the Municipal Council, the number of refugees in the Public Concession at present is still difficult to estimate accurately, but regarding the number of poor households and refugees who have already returned to their hometowns, according to the closest estimate, from August 12 to August 24, the number of people who left the South Station for Hangzhou and the stations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was about 300,000, and the number of people who took ships or inland river boats to Ningbo and other places in the interior was more than 40,000, but the actual number may be more than that. Those who stay in the Public Concession (mostly in shelters, but there are thousands of people living in residences and sleeping in alleys) are also closely monitored and cared for by the authorities. The donations received for relief work are quite satisfactory. The Municipal Council has promised to donate 10,000 yuan for refugee relief, which is the initiation of various Chinese and foreign groups, and hopes that the Municipal Council's donation can arouse the response of many important groups, as well as wealthier families and the middle class, to relieve the refugees in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Fundraising</p>
<p>The Comfort Group of the All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association specially sent commissioners yesterday to comfort the frontline soldiers. They learned that the front lines urgently need burlap sacks and comfort bags (cloth color should be grass green). Please donate enthusiastically. They also learned that many wounded soldiers in the rear have recovered and need ordinary shirts and trousers when they are discharged from the hospital. It is especially hoped that women's organizations will quickly collect these items to meet the urgent need.</p>
<p>According to reports, the front lines urgently need physical objects such as lead wire, electric wire, and automobiles. It is hoped that all public organizations will use the funds they have raised to purchase and send these items.

<h3>News of School Openings in Shanghai During Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Art College Will Open on Schedule</p>
<p>The Shanghai Art College, considering that education is the foundation of national salvation and that young people idling at home and abandoning their studies is a waste of the country's vitality, is continuing to carry out all its work as usual, even in these extraordinary times. It is also complying with the Ministry of Education's telegram to extend the opening date to September 20th, maintaining classes as much as possible, and accommodating students from war zones to audit and transfer. In recent days, students coming to Shanghai from the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, as well as those living in Shanghai, have been flocking to the school to register. The labor specialty program commissioned by the Ministry of Education has also designated various provinces to send students to the school. The school is located in the French Concession, and the location is very safe. Furthermore, the Propaganda Group of the Student Service Corps of the school, led by Professor Liu Shi, set off on the 29th to Nanjing, Changsha, Hankou, Yunnan, and other places to conduct wartime propaganda.</p>
<p>Recruitment for the Experimental Primary School</p>
<p>The Huanyu Primary School, attached to the Global Chinese Student Association at 191 Carter Road, will open on September 3rd. The English Night School will open on September 10th. It will continue to recruit new male and female students and will also recruit war zone refugees with reduced fees. If anyone is in economic distress and cannot prepare the tuition fees in time, they can be paid in installments.</p>
<p>The Huadong Girls' Middle School Opens</p>
<p>The Huadong Girls' Middle School on Avenue Joffre in this city, considering that it is located in a safe area and to protect the students' studies, opened on the 27th of this month and scheduled to officially begin classes on September 10th. It is reported that new and old students are arriving at the school to register, pay fees, and students from other schools are going to register in large numbers. Qinghua Middle School, Qingxiao Primary School, and Huazhong Primary School at 428 White Road, believe that rear education is extremely important during the national crisis and opened classes yesterday. They have set up a method of paying fees in four installments. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Vocational Middle School Night School Department and Chengzhong Middle School are discussing auditing classes with the school, so the students are very enthusiastic. It is reported that there are not many remaining places, so it is advisable to enroll quickly to avoid missing out.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Temporarily Borrowing Guangxia</p>
<p>Jiangxi Middle School and Jiangxi Senior Vocational School in Nanshi of this port, because Nanshi is affected by the war and it is inconvenient to attend classes, are temporarily borrowing Guangxia Middle School on Route Pichon, in accordance with the Ministry's order, to hold classes on September 20th. They have already notified the school's students yesterday to go to the temporary office at 260 Rue Poussin in the French Concession to register in advance, so as not to interrupt their studies.</p>
<p>Huahua Wartime Education</p>
<p>Huahua Middle School on Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai opened yesterday. During this period of full-scale resistance against Japan, there have been slight changes in the curriculum compared to the past. In addition to the three basic courses of Chinese, English, and mathematics, which still maintain the original hours, other non-major subjects have been changed to teach knowledge related to wartime, including lectures on current political situations, national disaster history and geography, military common sense, and protection common sense. In order to adapt to the wartime economic situation, the school has also set up a method of paying fees in installments. The middle school department is scheduled to start classes on the 10th, while the elementary school department is scheduled to start classes on the 6th.</p>
<p>Dare to Take on the Education of Refugees</p>
<p>Qi Yifen, Principal of Daqian Elementary School, and a member of the Chinese Women's Federation, believes that refugee reception and education are essential for a long-term war of resistance. Therefore, a refugee shelter was established at the school a week ago, and students were ordered to be little teachers to educate the refugees, instilling wartime common sense, lecturing on national heroes, and telling stories of Japanese atrocities, as well as reporting current events. Spare time is taken to solicit clothes, shoes, socks, and other items from the parents of the students, which are distributed to the refugees. Therefore, the refugees in the shelter can all take care of public property and abide by order.</p>
<p>Minzhi Attending Classes to Save the Country</p>
<p>Minzhi Elementary School and Kindergarten on Weihaiwei Road is safe in location, and the daily homework is taken seriously. Since classes started last month, classes have been held for many days. More than 650 new and old students have arrived at the school. In addition to implementing extraordinary education and preparing short-term public schools, teachers and students continue to do their best to donate. For example, wedding rings, gold and silver have been handed over to Laofengxiang Silver Shop, four boxes of beef and 20 cans of biscuits have been handed over to the Local Association, more than 1,000 pieces of old clothes have been handed over to the Education Circle Service Group, 160 burlap sacks, raincoats, flashlights, and batteries have been handed over to Dagongbao News Agency, 50 sets of shirts for wounded soldiers have been handed over to Da Wanbao News Agency, bed sheets and oilcloth have been handed over to the Red Cross, and national salvation bonds are also being promoted.</p>
<h3>Vaccination in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council, considering that there are too many people in the concession and refugees are gathering, in order to prevent cholera, specially notified citizens to get cholera vaccinations. It is scheduled to be administered every day from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm at 630 Rue Amiral Bayle and 830 Route de Zikawei. If there are a large number of citizens to be vaccinated at the same location, the council can send personnel to administer the vaccinations.</p>
<h3>Strict Investigation of Refugees Registering and Collecting Money</h3>
<p>Ma Zhujun and Others from Changshu are Fraudulently Registering and Collecting Donations</p>
<p>Since the start of the Shanghai war, all hometown associations have done their best to find ways to relieve and shelter refugees, or send them back to their hometowns. However, Ma Zhujun (aka Huangfu Du) and others from Changshu took this opportunity to organize the Changshu Hometown Temporary Relief Association and published announcements instructing all fellow villagers to register in advance to engage in repatriation. During the registration process, Ma and others extorted certain donations from the refugees. The amount of income in recent days is extremely considerable. Some people who were forced not to follow their fellow villagers immediately reported to the Shanghai Relief Committee. After the committee sent personnel to investigate and verify the facts yesterday afternoon, they brought the witnesses back together and decided to transfer these unscrupulous elements to the police station for strict investigation tomorrow.</p>
