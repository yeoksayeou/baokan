<p>决定無期休會藉此下塲　美代表團奉命襥被歸國</p>
<p>⊙比京　九國公約會議、本日午後五時將於失望與懊喪之中、重行開會、屆時各國代表當將英美兩國所擬議之第二次宣言書草案加以研究、此項宣言書、當略述日本拒絕參加九國公約會議後所造成之局勢、並决定延會至無限期、惟延會一層或將稍緩另行决定、亦未可知、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙白魯塞爾　出席比京會議之英美代表、昨草擬宣言、連夜工作、至今晨三時始脫稿、將與主席斯巴克討論之、並將於今午交英自治領各代表開會研究之、此項宣言追述中日衝突之一般情形、並提議比京會議無期休會、如此稿為各國代表所贊同、則二十三日將開第二次亦卽最後一次之會議、（中央社二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>⊙比京　美國今日已拒絕英國所提兩國共同設法制止遠東戰事之建議、按英美兩國代表亟欲於九國公約會議明日午後四時重開之前、覓得顧全顏面之辦法、俾可於開會時提出、上述建議亦為辦法之一、英國主張由會議授權英美、向中日進行調解、美代表台維斯則恐此舉將仍遭日本拒絕、故未同意、其後兩國代表復互相磋商、茲已暫時决取另一方法、稍為遮掩會議之失敗、而結束目前之難堪狀態、所謂另一方法、蓋卽建議暫時休會、以俟中日兩國任何一方請求之後再開、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>美孤立派活動</h3>
<p>竭力鼓吹實施中立法</p>
<p>［華盛頓］因九國公約會議、各國代表有以會議失敗歸罪美國之意、在美國國會方面已引起大反感、因而對各國停付戰債一事加以攻擊、美國參議員柳易斯主張、“最好羅斯福總統能召回美國之代表、因此次會議之目的、在使美國立於攻擊日本德國及意大利之地位也”、共和黨參議員格雷萊氏、今日召集贊助實施中立法者集會、商討實施中立法之决議、民主黨人馬克倫諾爾斯稱、“若美參加此次會議、僅與他國共同譴責日本為破壞九國公約、亦甚正當”、又馬克倫諾爾斯之代表云、“予信達到和平最上之策、卽為增進經濟之情形、各國若能履行債務、則不致損害國際間之好感、一旦遠東方面之問題得以解决、則商業上亦可以增進云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>英國政策轉變</h3>
<p>顯受日德意恊定影響</p>
<p>▲大阪朝日新聞云、英國對德意日三國防共恊定成立後、目下朝野上下、雖抱冷靜態度、但一般對此恊定、僉謂强化國際反共主義的陣營、英國雖不表示反對然英國以維持現狀爲信條、對此恊定、認為激化國際的對立、蓋英國對外政策、因歐洲政局關係、受直接的影響者、即㊀德國自來主張要求收復殖民地、今後德國態度必更强硬、㊁英對意關係、因地中海問題、不能根本解决、且將來亦無好轉希望㊂遠東中日問題、英國對日之態度、因與德意大不相同、然適値中日紛爭期內、突然成立此恊定、使英國對遠東問題之發言、大受牽制、同時德意對英之牽制、尤為有力、今後本此恊定、增强德意日之發言、查此恊定之內容、大意和對地中海政策力謀擴大勢力、故英意關係僉難好轉、英旣自顧不及豈願多管遠東問題乎、</p>
<h3>對日經濟制裁</h3>
<p>我抗戰持久始能收效</p>
<p>［華盛頓］據美國外交委員會但雪爾地氏之研究對日經濟制裁、若能由英美法俄四國誠意執行、確有效果、但其效果必待六個月後始能發現、故問題在於中國軍隊於此期間之內、對於日軍之進攻、能否支持耳（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯遠東政策仍採審愼態度</h3>
<p>不欲甘冒戰爭危險　紅軍堅强足禦侵略</p>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇聯駐中國大使鮑格莫洛夫返此已一月有餘、此間報紙迄無一字及之、鮑氏在莫斯科作何活動、此次返國原因何在、中國大使館方面亦未知之、若謂鮑氏與蘇聯政府發生齟齬亦未能置信、惟蘇聯遠東政策、似未必有所變更、換言之、卽以最大之審愼態度、避免一切冒險及戰事危險是也、溯自一九二五年以來、蘇聯執政者史丹林卽主張與日本接近、九一八事變之後、日本欲以武力佔據中東路、然史丹林仍主張改善日俄兩國關係、此間一般人士以為蘇聯紅軍充分堅强、足以驅退日本對蘇聯之任何侵略、而中國民族主義運動亦具有堅强之抵抗力量、惟九國公約會議所獲結果、殊為微細足見美國對於中日爭端、無探取强硬行動之可能、因此就蘇聯言之、自亦不擬在遠東有所行動、自中日衝突開始以來、中俄兩國貿易並無顯著之變動、此與蘇聯與西班牙貿易數量之大見增加迥乎不同、（按截至本年七月底為止、蘇俄貨物運往西國、共値八八八·○○○·○○○盧布、較諸去年共增加八五九·○○○·○○盧布之多、至西國貨物運往蘇俄者、在同一時期之內、亦自五·○○○·○○○盧布增至二○·○○○·○○○盧布、）此外、按中國駐俄大使館所得消息、本年共有韓人二十萬名不願受日本之統治、而移殖於蘇聯中亞西亞地方、特此輩韓人中是否有日本人混跡其間、藉以從事間諜、則殊難察覺耳、以言日俄兩國關係、雙方原曾訂有漁業讓與權暫行辦法、准許日本漁民在蘇俄領海內捕魚、其有效期限至本年年底卽須屆滿、但自去年十一月間、日德兩國反共恊定簽訂之後、俄國卽拒不與日本訂立正式漁業恊定、此在日本、則仍希望正式恊定得以成立、又關於庫頁島煤油管理建造問題、（按日本在該島獲有煤油礦讓與權）雙方亦曾發生爭執、緣蘇俄對與日本所擬建造之煤油管口徑、拒不接受、嗣後日本雖允加以减小、但此糾紛仍未解决云、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］英國樞密大臣哈立法克斯聘訪德國之後、已於本日午後返抵此間、當卽與外相艾登會晤、或將會晤張伯倫首相、報吿與德國政界要人談話之經過、（中央社二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］英國樞密大臣哈立法克斯勛爵、今晚九時廿二分啟程返國、瀕行時曾向報界發表談話、謂此次與希特勒元首暨德政府其他各要人進行談話之後、深望對於英德兩國關係、能有以澄淸之、各報記者有詢以曾否邀請德外長牛賴特前往倫敦賡續進行談話者、勛爵并未作答、僅謂本人此行、具有機密性質、與德國當局所討論者、究屬何種問題、在與英國政府當局會商之前、碍難有所揭露云、此在德國官塲人士對於談話內容、亦復諱莫如深、但各觀察家相信、外長牛賴特倫敦此行、為期當不在遠、（中央社廿一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］今日英樞密大臣哈立法克斯接見美國新聞記者稱、彼歷與德元首希特勒外長牛賴特·及航空部長戈林將軍等進行談話、其內容一以自由·坦白·非正式·信任為主云、哈氏表示其希望、謂此次談話之結果、將稍啟英德間較良諒解之門戶哈氏並極重視其所受延接之熱忱云、德國報紙一方面雖承認哈氏之訪問、可增加兩國之諒解但指陳此次談話僅有溝通意見、尚未可卽望其能發生積極效果、再則一方面並無失望之理由、亦不必有不合時之希冀、並稱牛賴特之訪英、亦無急切之必需云、（中央社二十一日路透電）</p>

<p>廈門通訊、敵陷金門後卽對廈門作種種攻擊準備之姿態、尤以本月十日以後為極積、十日、敵艦旣砲擊我要塞砲台達一百五六十發、同日飛機投彈八牧、十二日下午、敵艦二艘、又在廈島北部、距岸極遠以一小艇懸英國旗、向五通岸邊駛來、沿海岸探測水量、為我守軍以機槍擊退、敵兵傷倒艇上五六人、敵艦因此、乃自遠處向岸連發七砲、然後退去、十三日下午一時至四時餘、敵水上機一架、自金門飛來、往返四次、向我要塞×××砲台投彈、每次連投兩炸彈、十四日晨九時、敵巡洋艦一艘、自金門移廈島北部、十時、在距岸約千公尺處發砲向五通轟擊、至十一時止、共發二十八砲下午一時半至四時半又有敵機一架來、往返四次、向我要塞×××砲台（當廈港口南岸之內部地點大陸屬海澄縣轄）共投七彈、計由十日至十四日、敵艦砲襲三次、敵機空襲亦三次、發砲近百發、投彈二十三枚、我砲台及防禦工事、無絲毫損傷、僅十四日有一砲彈落五通鳳頭社、傷猪四頭、牛一頭、我方除十日由砲台還八砲外、均沉着未還砲但敵方目的、似權毀我要塞及防禦工事、試探我方兵力耳、</p>
<p>據一般觀察、敵圖廈門、乃以廈門港深水闊、民國後、日聯合艦隊曾三次來廈、最後一次、為去年八月、集日第一二艦隊之精英八十餘艦、最大三萬三千餘噸之長門等戰鬥艦、亦復參與、均得以回旋自如、且廈門島上、可闢大飛行塲、氣候又佳、又宜飛行、今敵僅取金門港窄浪高、難泊多艦、島上山陵起伏、又不能闢飛行塲、海風亦大、不宜起降、海空均非良地、故敵方久有圖廈之想、又廈門距香港僅二百二十海里、距菲律賓五百海里距台灣則為一峽之隔、適居台湾之肘腋、扼英美遠東屬地前綫之衝也第至邇時、形勢上時間上、是否容其從容犯廈、又一大問題也、</p>
<p>敵陷金門不久後、忽一變其政策、除沿海漁民懸日旗卽可出漁、並囑召携糧出海、以易白糖什貨毒品為易外、近復以金門物價飛漲、乃自台灣運米三千包到金、每斗售六角半、原價則八角、火柴每盒銅元一枚、原價四枚、猪漲至每斤三角半四角、减為角半諸如此類、對一切日用品、故意跌價市思、但須用白鈔、我國鈔票、則拒不用、並專收買黃金白銀、另以雜貨等傾銷誘人向閩南走私、凡此殆在示威之施以誘惑也、（十一日十六日）</p>

<h3>列山隨筆</h3>
<p>— 馮列山</p>
<p>關於吸烟問題</p>
<p>好像從前徐志摩氏曾經提起過，英國牛津大學敎育法的長處在於敎授會敎學生吸烟。他讚美這個吸烟制度，說是幾年以後這批學生一到社會上去便立刻變成了道地的紳士。這一點大約徐氏忽略了牛津，劍橋兩大學的學生大半都是英國貴族幷富家的子弟，他們未來的出路，幾乎早是現成的，於是乎把這個攻効算在吸烟的賬上。其實，這兩家大學主要的目的在於製造一批統治人材，而不是科學專家。假如吸烟眞的同學間的修養有那麼大的關連，那末英國人就非個個都變成學者不可。理由：吸烟在英國是一宗極普遍的現象</p>
<p>一個不會吸烟的人跑到倫敦來的確也有許多苦處。這並不是說，不會吸烟硬做不成紳士。英國不但有不吸烟的紳士，甚至於他們還組織了一個“不吸烟會”；苦處在於你隨時隨地都會碰到這種“香烟霧”。不但在街頭電車，地道車，酒館，咖啡店等等地方；甚至於就在電影院，戲院，音樂會中這一批紳士淑女們也無不盡量大抽他們的香烟。有時你不幸恰恰坐在一位有“香烟癮”的先生身旁，包你有機會眼看他接連地一根香烟跟着另外一根。尤其是許多年輕的姑娘們愛來這一套。這種現象連英國人自己也覺得不快。新近“不吸烟會”的會員特別開了一個大會，呈請政府，禁止觀衆在電影院，戲院，音樂會中吸烟。這一來英國各報上就大討論起吸烟問題。有的報紙說，不吸烟的似乎只是少數人。旣然大多數觀衆希望吸烟，那末少數人就沒有强迫多數人的理由。這一家報紙說，吸烟問題與營業也有密切的關係。電影院的老板决沒有法子阻止觀衆，假如觀衆高興吸烟的話。否則他的生意就會受到損失。那一家報紙說，吸烟還有調和的功用。因爲英國有許多電影片子與戲劇，不是以吸烟來消磨時間分散精神，在戲院理簡直就無法坐下去。終於號外一家報紙提議，模倣紐約電影院的辦法，就是樓上可以吸烟，樓下不准吸烟，自然這是一個良好的妥恊方法，不過能否行得通，還是一個問題。因爲這種乎已經成了風俗的吸烟習慣，一時恐怕不容易改革掉。</p>
<p>恰同這種情形相反的是德國。在德國的電影院，戲院裏是不准吸烟的。甚至于公共地方對于吸烟也有相當的限制，特別是對于女性。德國婦女偶然在衆人面前吸烟，時常總會受到男子們的“輿論制裁”。德國有一句流行的俗語“德國女人不吸烟”。記得有一次在一車站上聽到一個年紀卅幾歲的大漢向一位時裝的女子警告：“德國女人不吸烟”。可是這位吸烟的女子却不慌不忙轉過頭來說：“我是瑞士人，德國的女人同我又有什麼關係，你說”？㊁另外一個笑話。據說有一位德國女士某天在一家咖啡店中吸烟。她這種舉動當時就引起幾個男子的不平。中間有一位男客自吿奮勇，寫了“德國女人不吸烟”的字條送給這位女士，當作警告。這位女士却在那字條上附加了幾個字立刻交還給他。等到他們打開來看了以後，大家不響了。原來這位女士所回答的是“德國男子只有老婆，沒有姘頭”！</p>
<p>兩年前國社黨靑年中對于“德國女人不吸烟”這句口號，不但竭力擁護，而且大有非使它實現不可的氣概。後來爲了宣傳部部長哥白爾司博士的夫人，是一位嗜好吸烟的女同志，這個口號終于取消掉。在德國社交界中，許多外國人都愛拿吸烟問題來開德國小姐們的玩笑。當她們不肯吸烟的時候，便說：“德國的太太（德文Frau有女人與太太兩義）不吸烟，可是您是一位德國的小姐”！。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>均勢與孤立</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>就歷史上看來。我中國在近代是憑藉着列强的均勢才能夠逐步發展的。這幾年日本露骨的侵略行動促醒了我全民族對於自力奪鬥的覺悟。同時也打破了列强在中國的均勢。前者的結果。是目前大規模的全面抗戰。後者的結果。則是日本陷於孤立的地位。</p>
<p>德意日反共公約的成立似乎可以解救日本苦悶的孤立狀態了罷。其實德意日三國的實力卽使合併起來。也遠敵不過一切和平國家的實力。而且三國的利害各不相同。這種結合是否能夠維持得長久。還是疑問。在目前日本固然可以利用這個公約做武器。使全世界的和平國家害怕戰禍的擴大。而對中國的運命保持觀望的態度。但是這種局勢難道能夠儘管不轉變的麼。</p>
<p>我想轉變是一定會到來的。最近英國外交的活動在歐洲方面有着顯著的成功。西班牙問題因蘇聯的讓步快要解决了。哈里法克斯和希特勒的會談據說也是十分圓滿的。顯然。英國的努力是要使歐局穏定下來。不受遠東戰事的影響。如果這個目的能够達到。歐美列强就可以用全力來應付遠東的危機了。</p>
<p>無論如何。遠東的危機是歐美列强萬不能忽視的。日本用反共公約來解救自身孤立的苦悶。未必會有多大的成效呢。</p>

<h3>The Enemy Advances by Land and Sea; Our Army Firmly Defends Jiangyin and Wuxi Positions</h3>
<p>Enemy Artillery Shells Duanshan Island, Attempting to Breach the Jiangyin Blockade Line; Fierce Skirmish Erupts in Dongting Town on the Wuxi-Changshu Road; The Enemy Invading Jiaxing Advances Past Puyuan, Peering into Tongxiang; We Deploy 200,000 Troops to Defend Nanjing</p>
<p>After a week of bloody battles on the first line of national defense, stretching from Fushan on the Yangtze River to Zhapu in Hangzhou Bay, our army was forced to abandon that line and retreat to strongholds such as Jiangyin, Wuxi, Changxing, Yixing, Chongde, Xiashi, and Haiyan. The situation on the eastern front has thus entered a new phase. In addition to our forces digging in west of that line, fighting at every turn, we have also established a second Yangtze River blockade line at Jiaoshan in Zhenjiang. Simultaneously, we are reinforcing fortifications in the 20-kilometer area surrounding Nanjing, assembling 200,000 heavily armed troops in preparation for a decisive battle with the enemy. Our military authorities have been directing operations from somewhere on the front lines in recent days, displaying remarkable composure and extraordinary resolve. This newspaper obtained detailed information yesterday regarding the situation and battles on various fronts, which are described below: ㊀ On the south bank of the Yangtze River, after the fall of the Fushan fort, enemy warships began to advance westward in droves, attempting to break the Jiangyin blockade line. From the morning of the 21st onwards, they have been heavily shelling our positions near Duanshan Island from the waters east of Duanshan. Our Jiangyin fortresses have responded with heavy artillery fire. ㊁ The enemy in the Changshu area, numbering over two regiments, after occupying Changshu, is now advancing fiercely westward along the southern bank of Shanghu Lake on the Wuxi-Changshu Road, equipped with mechanized units, aiming for Wuxi. Last night (21st), a fierce skirmish erupted near Dongting Town. The sound of artillery fire was clearly audible in Wuxi. ㊂ The enemy advancing westward from the Suzhou front, with a force of over two divisions, after occupying Suzhou, is now advancing directly on Wuxi along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line. Fierce fighting is currently taking place on both sides of Zhoujingxiang, southeast of Wuxi. The enemy is resorting to its old tactics, deploying a large number of motorboats to transport marines along the northern shore of Lake Tai, attempting to outflank Wuxi from the rear. However, our army has heavily garrisoned the northern shore of Lake Tai, along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line, and the enemy in that area will undoubtedly be dealt a severe blow. ㊃ On the south bank of Lake Tai, the enemy has invaded Wuxing from Gucun to the west. Intense fighting is currently taking place five or six kilometers west of Gucun. According to other reports, fighting has already reached the outskirts of Wuxing. Our army, under pressure from the enemy advancing by water along the south bank of Lake Tai, appears poised to abandon Wuxing. ㊄ The enemy advancing from Jiaxing, also numbering over one division, is advancing in two directions: one westward towards Chongde and Shimen, currently in a standoff around Puyuan and Tongxiang; the other southwestward along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line towards Xiashi, currently locked in a stalemate between Wangdian and Xiashi. The enemy advancing along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is still being blocked by our heavy forces on the Pinghu-Zhapu line.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin's Defenses are Tight</h3>
<p>The Fushan fortress on the south bank of the Yangtze River and the Langshan fortress on the north bank serve as protection for the Jiangyin fortresses, forming a dangerous salient. However, after our army withdrew from Changshu and Suzhou, Fushan was lost. Consequently, dozens of enemy warships sailed upstream, attempting to breach our Yangtze River blockade line and threaten Zhenjiang and Nanjing. The enemy is currently planning to land at Duanshan Island and Zhouzhuang, east of Jiangyin. Enemy warships engaged in fierce artillery battles with our Jiangyin fortresses yesterday. We are now preparing a second blockade line near Zhenjiang to prevent the enemy from penetrating further. Our defenses in the Jiangyin area are tight, and if the enemy attacks, we will put up a fierce resistance.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to an official announcement this morning, defensive fortifications have been constructed in the 20-kilometer zone around Nanjing. The population continues to evacuate, and Nanjing is gradually becoming a ghost town. 80% of the shops are closed. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Gucun and Jicun</h3>
<p>The enemy advancing westward along the Huguang-Jiaxing Highway, after passing through Wangjiangjing, Shengze, Pingwang, Meiyan, and Zhenze and reaching Nanxun, has engaged in fierce fighting with our army in the Wuzhen area. At the same time, we have mobilized a large force from Huzhou to encircle and attack from the east. In the past two days, the fighting in Gucun, west of Nanxun, and in Jicun, about five kilometers further west, has been extremely intense. Although the distance from Jicun to the east gate of Huzhou is over 20 kilometers, our army has built extremely solid fortifications in the area outside the city, sufficient for a firm defense. However, the enemy is constantly using a large number of motorboats to exert pressure along the south bank of Lake Tai. Yesterday, a large number of enemy aircraft flew to the rear of this area and carried out a massive bombing raid, destroying many villages.</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] The enemy harassing Jiaxing advanced past Puyuan on the morning of the 21st, peering into Tongxiang. Our army is currently blocking and attacking them outside the city. In Wuxing, our army has built solid positions outside the city, preparing to fight to the death with the enemy. (Central News Agency Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops in Zhapu Repelled</h3>
<p>[Hangzhou] At about 2:00 PM on the 20th, about 200 enemy soldiers were spotted in Zhapu and have already been repelled by us. On the Pinghu front, more than a thousand enemy soldiers arrived on the 20th and appear to be attempting to infiltrate Haiyan. Enemy soldiers are also entrenched on the islands of Chuanhu in Dinghai, apparently wounded soldiers recuperating there. (Central News Agency Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to news received here, after the Japanese army occupied Changshu and Suzhou, they continued to advance westward towards Wuxi. From the 20th to the morning of the 22nd, the fighting in that area was very fierce. Japanese warships on the Yangtze River continued to bombard Jiangyin, attempting to break through the Chinese army's blockade line. This morning, the weather cleared, and a large number of Japanese aircraft mobilized, flying to Wuxi and Jiangyin to carry out large-scale bombing raids. However, there have been no changes in the Chinese army's positions. Furthermore, the fighting on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is also very intense. The Japanese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, in order to coordinate with the Japanese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, has launched an attack on Wangdian, aiming for Hangzhou. The Japanese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is currently still engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army near Wuxing. (News Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Our Army Firmly Defends Tongxiang and Chongde</h3>
<p>After Jiaxing was occupied by the enemy, Haiyan and Xiashi suddenly became critical. Enemy warships in Hangzhou Bay have been continuously shelling the Haiyan area for days. The enemy in Jiaxing has launched attacks in two directions: one along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road towards Wangdian, where we have heavy forces stationed and are engaged in fierce battles with the enemy. Wangdian has been repeatedly gained and lost, but we are still holding on. The other route is by waterway towards Shimen and Tongxiang, where the fighting is intense. Our positions from Xiashi and Changan to Tongxiang, Shimen, and Chongde are closely linked and can be firmly defended. As for the enemy advancing westward along the Sujia Road from Zhenze and Nanxun, they occupied Gucun the day before yesterday, and yesterday there were reports that they had also occupied Wuxing.</p>
<h3>Enemy Not Landed at Langshan</h3>
<p>It was rumored yesterday that enemy warships were shelling Langshan, with the intention of landing on the north bank of the Yangtze River to outflank the Jiangyin blockade line, and that Langshan had been occupied by the enemy. This caused much discussion and widespread panic. This newspaper's reporters made many inquiries to confirm, but were unable to verify. Later, the Taikoo Company's Wuhu steamer arrived in Shanghai from Wuhu at 5:00 PM last night. According to a passenger, Mr. So-and-so, he left Tiantonggang in Nantong at 9:30 AM that morning, and the area was calm and normal. Two Japanese shallow-draft gunboats were anchored in the waters off Langshan, and there were 40 to 50 Japanese transport ships and warships off Fushan on the south bank of the Yangtze River, but they were not firing. At 2:30 PM, when the steamer arrived at Liuhekou, no sound of gunfire was heard, suggesting that there was no shelling or landing at Langshan. Later, the reporter met with an employee of the Wuhu steamer, who, when asked about the situation in Nantong, gave a concurring account, confirming that there was definitely no unusual activity on the north bank of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>[Nantong] The number of enemy vessels in the Langfu crossing waters has increased again, attempting to advance westward and break the Jiangyin blockade line. We have strengthened our defenses to prevent this. (Special Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nantong Correspondent) After the Shanghai battle situation shifted, the Nantong area saw a sharp increase in enemy vessels in the Langfu crossing waters, reaching a maximum of 83 ships. Since the 14th, they have been continuously firing at the south bank day and night. On the 17th and 18th, the river was shrouded in thick fog, and visibility was extremely poor, with no movement from enemy vessels. From 6:00 AM on the 19th, they resumed aimless blind shelling of Fushan Port and Changyinsha. Changyinsha protects Yu Cheng and is still firmly defended by our army. Although the enemy has attempted to land, they have been unable to succeed. Nantong is located in the rear on the north bank of the Yangtze River and is not of major military importance. However, in order to consolidate coastal defenses, all ports have been closed, and heavy troops have long been stationed there, so there is no cause for concern about security. In the past few days, British merchant ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo companies have been traveling between Nantong and Shanghai, transporting goods and passengers, and connecting to inland river steamers to Tongzhen, connecting with the upper Yangtze River. Since the fighting in Shanghai shifted westward, mail parcels from Shanghai to various ports on the Yangtze River have been forwarded through Nantong. The Jiangsu Postal Administration has now transferred large postal trucks and steamers to Tong, to transport mail parcels to Zhenjiang and various places in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Another 2,000 Enemy Reinforcements Arrive</h3>
<p>Around 7:00 AM yesterday morning (22nd), three more enemy transport ships converted from merchant vessels, No. 316 Fukumaru, No. 366 Beijingmaru, and No. 354 Shinyomaru, docked at the Huangpu, Osaka, and Huishan docks, carrying approximately 2,000 enemy reinforcements. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the enemy Red Cross ship converted from a merchant vessel, Taishanmaru, sailed to the Osaka dock, and transported approximately 1,000 wounded soldiers who had gradually recovered from various enemy military hospitals in the eastern Shanghai area, to Japan last night for recuperation. At the same time, the vacated beds will accommodate newly returned wounded soldiers from the front. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The two enemy Red Cross ships, Dajimaru, which sailed to Shanghai the day before yesterday (21st), unloaded a large amount of medical supplies at the Huishan and Osaka docks, and last night loaded more than 1,500 enemy wounded soldiers before setting sail for Japan this morning.

<h3>Our Army's Withdrawal from Suzhou and Jiaxing</h3>
<p>[Wuxi] After our army blocked the enemy in the Zhengyi area on the eastern front, the two sides have been in a standoff for several days. The enemy's strength in that area was initially not very strong, and after being severely attacked by us for several days, they did not dare to advance quickly. They then resorted to indiscriminate bombing of our rear by air force. Zhengyi, Weiting, Suzhou and other places were severely bombed, and many of our fortifications were destroyed. In particular, enemy planes dropped more than 1,000 bombs and many incendiary bombs in and around Suzhou City on the 14th and 15th, burning a third of the entire city, causing countless civilian casualties, a scene too horrible to look at. In order to avoid sacrifices and adjust the front line, our army withdrew from Zhengyi to a new position in the western suburbs of Suzhou on the 20th. The enemy did not dare to advance at that time. It was heard that on the 21st, the Japanese entered Suzhou City. In Changshu, the enemy repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the city from Hupukou, and also bombed it by air. In order to avoid a tortuous battle line, our army retreated from Changshu City to a new position, which is now a straight line. Heavy troops are deployed in all important strongholds. Also, on the Sujia Railway, because the enemy has broken through our Pingwang Station, Jiaxing has also fallen into enemy hands, and Pinghu and Zhapu are also in critical condition. Our army ordered all armies to defend each stronghold on the Sujia Road to the death, and at the same time deployed new positions outside the cities of Wuxing and Tongxiang. At present, the left and right wings of our entire line are echoing each other remotely, and the defense is easy. (Central News Agency Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Enemy Uses Firewood and Bamboo Rafts to Transport to the Front</h3>
<p>Three enemy transport ships converted from merchant ships, Sanhemaru, Haisemaru, and the 3rd Ryumaru, fully loaded with ammunition and bamboo rafts, etc., sailed to Nanhuangpu the day before yesterday, moored at Minhang Town and unloaded ashore. Yesterday, dozens of trucks used by the enemy army transported them to the front in batches. In addition, four enemy gunboats were parked in the Nanhuangpu area, patrolling the river surface from time to time for security. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Around noon yesterday, two more enemy transport ships, No. 373 (name unknown) and No. 216 Yamagatamaru, sailed to Shanghai, berthed at the Qiujiang Wharf and the fish market riverfront, and unloaded the ammunition they were carrying onto many barges moored next to the ships, which were successively transported to the upper reaches of the Wusong River and transferred to Lake Tai. At the same time, the enemy transport ship Nachimaru, which has been sailing to Shanghai successively in recent days, unloaded wooden boards at the China Merchants Bureau Middle Wharf, and the Chikugomaru at the Huishan Wharf, and the Yayoi Maru at the New Huishan Wharf, unloaded ammunition into small motorboats, and each boat, after being fully loaded with ammunition, drove to the front for application. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The enemy crane ship Seikamar, converted from a merchant ship, sailed to Shanghai the day before yesterday and berthed at the fish market riverfront, preparing to lift and repair the various ships that were sunk near the Nan Ning and Shao wharves of the 16th Concession to seal off the Huangpu River, so that they could be used immediately. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday (22nd), an enemy transport ship sailed to the North Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, and the No. 376 Hokkomaru sailed to the Huangpu Wharf, unloading aircraft parts and countless guns and ammunition. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Announces Application Regarding Two Concessions</h3>
<p>Pay Attention to the Actions of Administrative Organs; The Authorities will Respond as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that yesterday (21st) a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy announced that Japan intends to take over the various administrative activities previously carried out by the Chinese in the Public Concession and the French Concession. The Japanese authorities said that the administrative power of the Municipal Council is limited to the provisions of the Land Regulations, and the Chinese have carried out administrative activities outside the scope of the Municipal Council. Now that the Japanese army has occupied the estuary of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the situation has changed, so the Japanese authorities intend to take over from the Chinese in principle. The agencies that the Japanese authorities intend to take over include the Customs, the Post Office, the Telegraph Administration, and the Courts. The spokesperson mentioned the Customs, saying that this agency is an agent of the Chinese government, and many foreigners are among its staff. In addition, the income of the Customs has been used to pay off loans, so special consideration is needed. The Post Office is currently not intended to be interfered with because the Japanese authorities do not want to interfere with public convenience. The same is true for the Telegraph Administration and the Courts, but the Japanese authorities reserve the right to speak out on the actions of these agencies. According to the above news, this was announced after the Japanese authorities asked the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession to eliminate all activities of the Central Government commissioners and other anti-Japanese elements last Saturday and Sunday. According to the spokesperson, the Japanese Consul General Okamoto has notified the Municipal Council and the French authorities, making the following applications: ㊀ Curb anti-Japanese and other malicious activities, disband all organizations such as Kuomintang branches, prohibit the posting of anti-Japanese slogans and the distribution of anti-Japanese texts, as well as the anti-Japanese propaganda of dramas, films, and radio broadcasts, curb the frenzy of Chinese "spies" and the hunt for "traitors." ㊁ Eliminate all central and local agencies of the Central Government and their representatives, and seriously monitor the activities of the Central Government and party leaders. ㊂ Prohibit the inspection of mail and telecommunications by the Central Government. ㊃ Prohibit the inspection of Chinese newspapers and news by the Central Government. ㊄ Prohibit unauthorized radio communication by the Chinese. The spokesperson said that the Public Concession authorities and the French authorities have agreed to implement the application of the Japanese authorities "as much as they can." A spokesperson for the Japanese military then made a statement, saying that the application of the Japanese Consul General was endorsed by Major General Harada, the Japanese military attaché. Harada, representing General Matsui, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army, visited Stirling Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, and Baudet, the French Consul General, stating that the Japanese army considered curbing anti-Japanese activities in the Public Concession and the French Concession necessary for the smooth march of troops in the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reported that Harada, the Japanese military attaché, visited the Public Concession and French Concession authorities on behalf of Matsui last Saturday and Sunday, when requesting to curb anti-Japanese activities within the Concession, said that if the steps taken by the two Concession authorities could not achieve the results desired by the Japanese and made the Japanese dissatisfied, the Japanese army reserved the right to take what it deemed necessary steps, and this step would be initiated by the Japanese army alone. When asked to clarify what this application by Harada and the steps that the Japanese were planning to initiate alone, the Japanese spokesperson replied that the Japanese army firmly believed that the authorities concerned would comply with this request, so this step had not yet been planned, because it was not considered necessary at this time. The spokesperson also said that the only difference between the Public Concession and the French Concession in the eyes of the Japanese was that the Public Concession had Japanese participation.</p>
<h3>Lianyungang's Situation is Tense</h3>
<p>The Enemy Once Landed and Was Immediately Driven Back; Our Hebei Guerrillas Are Extremely Active; Han Fuju Expresses Determination to Defend Jinan to the Death</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The fighting on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been relatively quiet since November 19th. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army on the north bank of the Yellow River has now retreated to Yancheng, 16 kilometers from the river. Jinan is now gradually returning to normal. The Japanese army landed in Lianyungang yesterday, and the situation was tense for a while, but after the arrival of the Chinese army, the Japanese landing force was immediately driven back.

The enemy's artillery positions near Lingshan in Hebei have been withdrawn, and it is said that the enemy in Jiyang has also withdrawn to Shanghe. Our Hebei guerrilla forces have been extremely active in recent days, launching frequent attacks on the enemy in the areas of Eping, Liaocheng, and Putai, causing them great threat. Also, most of the enemy in the Qiqiao area has also moved back, and only 200 people remain. The people of Jinan are becoming more calm. (Central News Agency Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Xinxiang ㊀ The enemy in Daming has been reinforced again in recent days, and they are quite restless. There are approximately 3,500 to 3,600 infantry, more than ten artillery pieces, and seven tanks entrenched near the city gates. A portion is still confronting us in the Chahukou area. ㊁ Enemy cavalry frequently harass the areas of Nanguantao, Longwangmiao Hezui, and Neihuang near Daming. ㊂ The enemy retreating to Linzhang is still watching on the north bank of the Zhang River, and there is no activity at present. ㊃ The enemy northeast of Neihuang appears to be advancing, but our army's defense is extremely tight, and the enemy will definitely not succeed. (Central News Agency Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] According to Chinese sources, there was no major battle on the Tianjin-Pukou front this morning. Jinan has returned to normal.

<p>[Tianjin] On the 21st, both sides made new progress in the fighting on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. It is said that the Chinese army is still firmly defending its positions on the south bank of the Yellow River, and small teams of Chinese troops are carrying out guerrilla warfare behind the Japanese lines on the north bank of the Yellow River. According to a military observer, the Japanese army intends to avoid the natural barrier of the Yellow River and land in the Jiaodong area. (Express News Agency Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Nanjing Three Times</h3>
<p>Our Air Force Rose to Meet Them; One Enemy Aircraft Was Shot Down, Several Were Damaged</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After ten days of continuous rain, the weather cleared up at once, and enemy aircraft attempted to attack Nanjing three times on the 22nd, but were bravely repelled by our air force. The first time was at about 7:00 AM, when seven enemy bombers dropped several bombs in Lishui and Danyang. The second time was when eight enemy bombers dropped several bombs in Danyang and Zhenjiang. Both times they attempted to attack Nanjing, but seeing that we were prepared, they flew to Jurong and turned back. At about 1:00 PM, several enemy bombers, under the cover of several fighters, invaded Nanjing again. Our air force immediately went to intercept them, and the enemy bombers immediately fled in panic. Their fighters soared over the city of Nanjing with our aircraft, chasing each other and fighting hundreds of rounds. Our anti-aircraft guns also assisted in the battle below, posing a threat to the enemy. After an hour of fierce fighting, one enemy aircraft was hit by us and crashed. Its fuel tank was damaged, and it fled. The remaining aircraft were also injured and unable to support, and fled in a panic. (Central News Agency Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A sky battle occurred here this afternoon, the first since October 12. At that time, a Japanese bomber was shot down and crashed. There were two air raid alerts in the morning, one at 7:50 AM and one at 10:10 AM, but no Japanese planes were seen. At 1:30 PM, another alert was sounded. Not long after, the sound of engines roared, and seven Japanese light bombers appeared in the sky. Four Chinese fighters rose to meet them, and three Japanese planes fought over the capital. After only a few seconds, one Japanese plane caught fire and fell downwards, crashing in the open space of the Central Military Academy. The other two continued to fight, but flew lower and lower. When they were only a few hundred yards from the ground, they accelerated and flew south of the city, disappearing in an instant. The other four Japanese planes had already escaped into the clouds. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Eleven enemy aircraft, at noon on the 21st, flew over Bian and turned to Huaiyang, dropping more than a dozen bombs. After bombing in Huaiyang, they turned to Heze and fled east along the Yellow River. Also, enemy aircraft were spotted over Kaocheng and Puyang on the 21st, spying at high altitude. (Central News Agency Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to official reports, the first air raid alert this morning was a test alert issued by the Central Government. The second alert was issued because eight Japanese aircraft were flying towards Nanjing, but the Japanese aircraft turned back to Jurong and dropped several bombs in Zhenjiang. At 1:30 PM, nine Japanese aircraft flew to the capital. Seven Chinese fighters met them and immediately shot down one Japanese aircraft. The pilot jumped out with an umbrella, and the rest flew into the clouds and disappeared. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Kaifeng] At about 11:00 AM on the 22nd, 15 enemy aircraft flew south through Qingfeng and Dongming in two routes. Five of them flew southeast over Kaifeng and Yuwangtai and heard of flying southwest to provide cover. The remaining ten flew south through Kaocheng, Neihuangji to Taikang, Huaiyang, and Zhoujiakou, dropping more than a dozen bombs in each place. Some civilian houses caught fire.

<h3>Central Bank of Guilin Branch Established in Wuzhou</h3>
<p>Officially Opens on New Year's Day Next Year, President and Vice President Arrived in Guilin Yesterday</p>
<p>Guilin - Xi Yan, the manager of the Guangxi branch of the Central Bank, and Wu Guangming, the deputy manager, arrived in Guilin on the 22nd. They immediately visited the provincial authorities to discuss financial matters. According to Wu, after the establishment of the branch, its business will include acting as an agent for the national treasury's income and expenditure, issuing banknotes, and handling remittances. On the other hand, it will also involve investigating local finances. If a locality needs construction funds, the central government can instruct the Guilin branch to provide advance payments nearby. Regarding private lending, because the bank is a national financial institution, it will not handle such matters. The rumor that the branch will redeem Guilin banknotes after its establishment is also untrue. The exchange rate between Guilin banknotes and legal tender has been fixed, and they will naturally be used at the same price. The preparations for the branch are nearing completion. The branch is located in Wuzhou and will officially open on New Year's Day next year. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Nine-Power Treaty Conference to Issue Second Declaration</h3>
<p>Decides on Indefinite Adjournment to Save Face, US Delegation Ordered to Pack and Return Home</p>
<p>⊙Brussels - The Nine-Power Treaty Conference will reconvene at 5 p.m. today in disappointment and frustration. At that time, the representatives of the various countries will study the draft of the second declaration proposed by the United Kingdom and the United States. This declaration will briefly describe the situation created after Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and decide to adjourn the conference indefinitely. However, the postponement may be delayed and a separate decision may be made. (Havas News Agency dispatch from Brussels on the 22nd)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels - The British and American representatives attending the Beijing conference drafted a declaration last night, working through the night and only completing it at 3 a.m. this morning. It will be discussed with Chairman Spaak and then submitted to the representatives of the British Dominions for study at a meeting this afternoon. This declaration reviews the general situation of the Sino-Japanese conflict and proposes an indefinite adjournment of the Beijing conference. If this draft is approved by the representatives of the various countries, the second and final meeting will be held on the 23rd. (Reuters News Agency dispatch from Brussels on the 22nd)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels - The United States today rejected the United Kingdom's proposal for the two countries to jointly find a way to stop the war in the Far East. The British and American representatives are eager to find a face-saving solution before the Nine-Power Treaty Conference reconvenes at 4 p.m. tomorrow so that it can be presented at the meeting. The above-mentioned proposal is one of the solutions. The United Kingdom advocated that the conference authorize the United Kingdom and the United States to mediate between China and Japan. The American representative, Davis, feared that this move would still be rejected by Japan, so he did not agree. The representatives of the two countries then consulted with each other again, and now a temporary decision has been made to take another method to slightly cover up the failure of the conference and end the current embarrassing situation. The so-called other method is to suggest a temporary adjournment, pending a request from either China or Japan for a resumption of the conference. (National News dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels - The US delegation was ordered today to pack up and prepare to catch the "President Harding" mail ship to New York from Harvard Port. (National News dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels - The Nine-Power Treaty Conference continued today. The chief representative of the United Kingdom, Eden, the chief representative of France, Tarbes, and the chief representative of the Soviet Union, Litvinov, did not attend. At that time, the United Kingdom will be represented by Dominion Minister Malcolm MacDonald, France will be represented by Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tedesan, and the Soviet Union will be represented by Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Bodankin. It is estimated that the conference will pass a second declaration, which will summarize the new situation created by Japan's refusal to participate in the conference, and announce an indefinite postponement tomorrow. The chief representative of China, Gu Weijun, saw the sudden return of the chief representative of the Soviet Union, Litvinov, the opposition of the chief representative of Italy, Macchi, to the first declaration of the conference, the temporary abandonment of voting rights by the representatives of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, and the increasingly serious attitude of the chief representative of the United States, Davis. He has already understood without any doubt the extent to which the countries can assist China. Therefore, in today's meeting, Gu only protested again against Japan's aggressive actions and requested that the countries provide material assistance to China and stop supplying Japan with arms and money. (Havas News Agency dispatch from Brussels on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Isolationist Activities in the United States</h3>
<p>Strive to Advocate the Implementation of Neutrality Laws</p>
<p>[Washington] Because the representatives of the various countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference attributed the failure of the conference to the United States, a strong resentment has been aroused in the US Congress, and it has attacked the issue of the various countries' failure to pay war debts. US Senator Lewis advocated, "It would be best if President Roosevelt could recall the US representative, because the purpose of this conference is to place the United States in a position to attack Japan, Germany, and Italy." Republican Senator Gray Larris convened a meeting today of supporters of the implementation of neutrality laws to discuss the resolution to implement neutrality laws. Democrat MacLennon Knowles said, "If the United States participates in this conference, it is only right to condemn Japan for violating the Nine-Power Treaty together with other countries." MacLennon Knowles' representative said, "I believe that the best way to achieve peace is to improve the economic situation. If the countries can fulfill their debts, they will not damage international goodwill. Once the problems in the Far East are resolved, commerce can also be improved." (National News dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Changes in British Policy</h3>
<p>Clearly Influenced by the Japan-Germany-Italy Pact</p>
<p>▲The Osaka Asahi Shimbun stated that after the establishment of the anti-communist pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, although the British government and the public hold a calm attitude, they generally believe that this pact strengthens the international anti-communist camp. Although the United Kingdom does not express opposition, it adheres to maintaining the status quo and believes that this pact intensifies international confrontation. The United Kingdom's foreign policy is directly affected by the European political situation, namely: ㊀ Germany has always insisted on demanding the recovery of colonies, and Germany's attitude will inevitably be even stronger in the future; ㊁ The United Kingdom's relationship with Italy cannot be fundamentally resolved due to the Mediterranean issue, and there is no hope of improvement in the future; ㊂ Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue in the Far East, the United Kingdom's attitude towards Japan is very different from that of Germany and Italy. However, the sudden establishment of this pact during the Sino-Japanese conflict greatly restricts the United Kingdom's say on the Far East issue. At the same time, Germany and Italy's restrictions on the United Kingdom are even more powerful. In the future, based on this pact, Germany, Italy, and Japan will increase their say. The general idea of the content of this pact is to expand their influence in the Mediterranean policy. Therefore, it is difficult to improve Anglo-Italian relations. Since the United Kingdom cannot take care of itself, why would it be willing to meddle in the Far East issue?</p>
<h3>Economic Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>Our Protracted Resistance Can Be Effective</p>
<p>[Washington] According to the research of Dan Schell, a member of the US Foreign Affairs Committee, economic sanctions against Japan can be effective if they are sincerely implemented by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Russia. However, the effect will only be seen after six months. Therefore, the question is whether the Chinese army can withstand the Japanese army's attack during this period. (National News dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Far East Policy Still Adopts a Cautious Attitude</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Risk War, the Red Army Is Strong Enough to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet Ambassador to China Bogomolov has returned here for more than a month, and no newspapers here have mentioned him. No one knows what Bogomolov is doing in Moscow or why he returned to China. It is unbelievable that Bogomolov has had a disagreement with the Soviet government. However, the Soviet Union's Far East policy does not seem to have changed. In other words, it is avoiding all risks and dangers of war with the greatest caution. Since 1925, Soviet leader Stalin has advocated getting closer to Japan. After the September 18th Incident, Japan wanted to occupy the Chinese Eastern Railway by force, but Stalin still advocated improving relations between Japan and Russia. People here generally believe that the Soviet Red Army is strong enough to repel any Japanese aggression against the Soviet Union, and the Chinese nationalist movement also has strong resistance. However, the results obtained at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference are very small, indicating that the United States is unlikely to take strong action on the Sino-Japanese dispute. Therefore, as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it does not intend to take any action in the Far East. Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese conflict, there has been no significant change in trade between China and Russia, which is very different from the large increase in the volume of trade between the Soviet Union and Spain. (According to the statistics up to the end of July this year, the total value of Soviet goods shipped to Spain was 888,000,000 rubles, an increase of 859,000,000 rubles compared to last year. The value of Spanish goods shipped to the Soviet Union also increased from 5,000,000 rubles to 20,000,000 rubles during the same period.) In addition, according to news from the Chinese Embassy in Russia, 200,000 Koreans this year are unwilling to be ruled by Japan and have moved to Central Asia in the Soviet Union. It is difficult to detect whether there are Japanese spies mixed among these Koreans. Regarding the relations between Japan and Russia, the two sides originally signed a temporary measure on fishing concession rights, allowing Japanese fishermen to fish in Soviet territorial waters. The validity period will expire at the end of this year. However, since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany in November last year, Russia has refused to sign a formal fisheries agreement with Japan. Japan still hopes that a formal agreement can be reached. There have also been disputes over the management and construction of crude oil on Sakhalin Island (Japan has a concession right to crude oil mines on the island). The Soviet Union refused to accept the diameter of the crude oil pipeline to be built with Japan. Although Japan later agreed to reduce it, the dispute has not yet been resolved.

<h3>Japanese Government Eager to Reform Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>To Adapt to the Wartime System</p>
<p>[Tokyo] With the aim of completely resolving the China Incident, the government has established the Imperial Headquarters and recently decided on a policy to actively improve various pending issues in domestic affairs. The Imperial Headquarters is a purely command institution, but in the sense of modern warfare, the high degree of unification in operations and military operations naturally requires strong implementation of policies in various administrative departments. Therefore, Prime Minister Konoe, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazami, President of the Planning Board Taki, and Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Funada are considering reforming the cabinet system. However, in practical terms, the reform of the cabinet system, or even the reorganization of the cabinet, cannot be realized urgently due to various reasons. Therefore, Prime Minister Konoe plans to first solve specific domestic problems to cope with the establishment of the Imperial Headquarters and to ensure that there are no regrets in the situation. It is reported that the domestic problems that the government wants to solve now include the establishment of a Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, reform of the civil service system, the General Mobilization Law, the Electricity National Management Law, the National Health Insurance Law, social legislation related to rural areas under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and economic legislation related to the situation under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

<h3>Japan Amends Fisheries Agreement with Russia</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] According to information received on the 22nd, negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union to amend the fisheries treaty have progressed to concrete negotiations as a result of a meeting between the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigemitsu, and the Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Stomonyakov, on the 22nd. In that meeting, Ambassador Shigemitsu stated that the current temporary agreement would expire in just over a month, and if this continued, it would become a treaty-less state after January of next year. It was feared that the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union would be damaged, so the Soviet Union should also cooperate with the Japanese government to respect the provisions of the Treaty of Portsmouth, quickly sign the amendment treaty that has become pending, and strive to prevent the worst-case scenario and promote reflection. The Deputy Minister replied that in principle, it should be understood immediately, so in the future, the Japanese Counselor, Mr. Nishi, and the Director of the Far East Department, Kazyrovsky, will conduct technical consultations. Ambassador Shigemitsu must also do his best to promote the establishment of the treaty by meeting with the Deputy Minister when necessary. (Allied News dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Contents of the Berlin Talks Are Confidential, Anglo-German Understanding Opens the Door</h3>
<p>Hitler Reiterates Colonial Demands, Aims to Recover Them Within Six Years</p>
<p>[London] British Lord Privy Seal Halifax returned here this afternoon after visiting Germany and immediately met with Foreign Secretary Eden, and may meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain to report on the talks with German political figures. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] British Lord Privy Seal Halifax departed this evening at 9:22 p.m. On the verge of departure, he made a statement to the press, saying that after talks with German leader Hitler and other important government officials, he deeply hoped that he could clarify the relations between Britain and Germany. When reporters asked if he had invited German Foreign Minister Neurath to London to continue the talks, the Lord did not answer, but only said that his trip was confidential in nature and that it was difficult to reveal what issues were discussed with the German authorities before consulting with the British government authorities. German officials were also tight-lipped about the content of the talks, but observers believed that Foreign Minister Neurath's trip to London would not be far off. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Berlin] British Lord Privy Seal Halifax met with American journalists today and said that he had held talks with German leader Hitler, Foreign Minister Neurath, and Air Minister General Goering, and that the content was based on freedom, candor, informality, and trust. Halifax expressed his hope that the result of the talks would open the door to a better understanding between Britain and Germany. Halifax also attached great importance to the enthusiasm with which he was received. Although German newspapers acknowledged that Halifax's visit could increase understanding between the two countries, they pointed out that the talks only communicated opinions and could not be expected to have a positive effect immediately. On the other hand, there was no reason to be disappointed, nor should there be inappropriate hopes, and there was no urgent need for Neurath to visit Britain. (Reuters News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[London] The Berlin correspondent of the "Manchester Guardian" recently declared, "The German government hopes that after the British Lord Privy Seal Halifax visits Germany, other British dignitaries will follow with formal missions. As for the talks held by Halifax in Germany, in addition to the issue of Germany's demand for colonies, they also touched on other issues in Europe. Halifax has obtained assurances from the German side that the purpose of the Berlin-Rome political axis is not to conflict with the interests of the United Kingdom, and that the anti-communist pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan does not oppose the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and Germany."

<p>[Berlin] Today was the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Nazi Party's local organization in Augsburg, and leader Hitler came to participate in the celebration. In his speech, Hitler predicted that Germany would recover all of its colonies within six years. Hitler said, "We should continue to demand colonies, and our call for them will become louder and louder until the world cannot refuse. This work is extremely difficult, but the most difficult part has now been completed." Regarding Germany's four-year plan, Hitler said, "Although this plan seeks national economic independence, it does not mean that Germany does not hope for the restoration of colonies. Germany's efforts to strengthen itself are an absolute necessity, because only in this way can we demand the return of colonies." Finally, Hitler reiterated, "Today, all countries are unwilling to mention the issue of colonies, but after a year, they will get used to hearing it. After three years, they will realize that there is a need to correct the situation. After six years, they will understand that practical steps must be taken, and the most important truth is that Germany today has a new and strong army and has eliminated the previous sense of inferiority." (Reuters News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[London] This morning, the local newspapers here jointly commented on Hitler's speech on the colonial issue in Augsburg yesterday and the Halifax talks, because they were connected in the order of their occurrence. The Daily Express declared that Hitler's speech should be noted because it was made at a time when it was being announced here that Halifax's visit to Germany had promoted Anglo-German relations and that formal negotiations would be held. Did the Anglo-German talks not involve the colonial issue? The Daily Mail reported that formal Anglo-German negotiations have now begun, and the obstacles between the two countries have been removed by this informal talk. British people believe that the increase in friendship between the two countries will be seen in the holding of formal negotiations, because from this, a permanent friendship between the two countries can be built. Most other newspapers believe that the result of the Halifax talks is indeed as Halifax said to German visitors, the door to understanding has been opened. (Haitong News dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Britain Prepares to Repay War Debt to the US</h3>
<p>Facilitating Trade Agreement Negotiations</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources here today, Britain intends to continue repaying its war debt to the United States. The British Cabinet is prepared to discuss this matter. It is said that financial leaders have advised Prime Minister Chamberlain to continue paying the war debt to the US, as this would facilitate negotiations for a British-American trade agreement and potentially secure future economic assistance from the US. However, experts believe that complete repayment of the war debt by Britain is impossible. Therefore, it may be necessary to increase British exports to the US as a condition. In short, this issue requires negotiation. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3>Japan's Military Expansion Affects National Economy</h3>
<p>Exports to China Almost Completely Halted; Small and Medium Enterprises Cry Out in Distress</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the cessation of Japanese exports to China and the cutoff of Chinese raw material imports to Japan, coupled with restrictions on general trade, have dealt a severe blow to small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises across the country. According to a survey by the Central Association of Commercial Associations, among the commercial and industrial enterprises exporting to China, those facing near extinction due to stalled sales account for 31% of the association's membership. This is the direct impact on small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises as producers. At the same time, due to the incident, the progress of large-enterprise dominance has led to fierce competition with small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises. The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry is striving to find ways to provide relief, such as converting small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises into military suppliers like provision factories, clothing factories, and weapons factories. They plan to establish industrial consultants, assigning them to various regions to directly guide and mediate for small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises. However, small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises are currently in dire straits, making relief a most difficult practical problem. Converting to military industry is an emergency relief measure, but the prerequisite is still the issue of survival, which is also deeply related to the overall national economy of Japan.</p>

<h3>Enemy Naval and Air Forces Frequently Harass Xiamen</h3>
<p>Multiple Attacks in Five Days</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After the enemy occupied Kinmen, they assumed various attack preparations on Xiamen, especially after the 10th of this month. On the 10th, enemy ships shelled our fortress batteries with 150-160 rounds. On the same day, enemy aircraft dropped eight bombs. On the afternoon of the 12th, two enemy ships, with a small boat flying the British flag, approached the Wutong shore in the northern part of Xiamen Island from a great distance. They probed the water depth along the coast and were repelled by our defending troops with machine-gun fire. Five or six enemy soldiers were injured and fell on the boat. The enemy ships then fired seven rounds from a distance towards the shore before retreating. From 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 13th, an enemy seaplane flew from Kinmen, making four round trips to bomb our fortress xxx battery, dropping two bombs each time. At 9:00 AM on the 14th, an enemy cruiser moved from Kinmen to the northern part of Xiamen Island. At 10:00 AM, it fired at Wutong from about 1,000 meters offshore, ceasing fire at 11:00 AM, having fired a total of twenty-eight rounds. From 1:30 PM to 4:30 PM in the afternoon, another enemy aircraft came, making four round trips, dropping a total of seven bombs on our fortress xxx battery (located inside the south shore of Xiamen Port, belonging to Haicheng County). From the 10th to the 14th, enemy ships shelled three times, and enemy aircraft attacked three times, firing nearly one hundred rounds and dropping twenty-three bombs. Our batteries and fortifications suffered no damage. Only on the 14th did one bomb land in the Fengtou Community of Wutong, injuring four pigs and one cow. Except for eight rounds fired by our batteries in retaliation on the 10th, we remained calm and did not retaliate. However, the enemy's aim seems to be to test our strength while destroying our fortress and fortifications.</p>
<p>From general observations, the enemy's intention to capture Xiamen is due to Xiamen's deep and wide harbor. After the founding of the Republic of China, the Japanese Combined Fleet came to Xiamen three times. The last time was in August of last year, gathering the elite of the Japanese First and Second Fleets, consisting of more than eighty ships, including the Nagato and other battleships with a maximum displacement of over 33,000 tons, all of which were able to maneuver freely. Moreover, a large airfield can be built on Xiamen Island, and the climate is good and suitable for flying. Now, the enemy only occupies Kinmen, where the harbor is narrow with high waves, making it difficult to berth many ships. The island has undulating hills and cannot be used as an airfield. The sea breeze is also strong and unsuitable for takeoffs and landings. The sea and air conditions are not good. Therefore, the enemy has long desired to capture Xiamen. Furthermore, Xiamen is only 220 nautical miles from Hong Kong, 500 nautical miles from the Philippines, and separated from Taiwan by a strait. It is located in the armpit of Taiwan, holding the lifeline of British and American territories in the Far East. However, whether the situation in terms of time and circumstances allows them to calmly invade Xiamen at this time is another major question.</p>
<p>Not long after the enemy occupied Kinmen, they suddenly changed their policy. Except for allowing coastal fishermen to fish by flying the Japanese flag and encouraging them to take grain to sea to exchange for white sugar, groceries, and drugs, they recently shipped 3,000 bags of rice from Taiwan to Kinmen due to soaring prices in Kinmen, selling each dou (peck) for 6.5 jiao (cents), while the original price was 8 jiao. Matches were sold for one copper coin per box, while the original price was four coins. Pork rose to 3.5-4 jiao per jin (pound) and was reduced to 1.5 jiao. They deliberately lowered the prices of all daily necessities, but only accepted white currency (silver dollars), refusing to accept our country's banknotes. They also specially purchased gold and silver, and used miscellaneous goods to lure people into smuggling to southern Fujian. All this is a demonstration of power and a tactic of enticement.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Elaborates on the Important Significance of the National Government's Relocation to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Expressing a More Determined Will in the Stage of Long-Term Resistance</p>
<p>[Hankou] Since the National Government declared its relocation to Chongqing, various officials have successively passed through here on their way west. Vice President of the Executive Yuan Kong Xiangxi answered questions from reporters and made the following remarks: In order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and engage in long-term resistance, the Central Government has specially relocated the National Government to Chongqing. Its important significance has been clearly stated in the National Government's declaration. What I can tell you now is that the enemy is using its violence to threaten our capital, thinking that our country can be subdued. They do not know that our greatest determination has long been established. This relocation of the National Government is not to abandon the capital, but to express our more determined will to the people and friendly nations in the stage of long-term resistance, and to give the enemy a warning. During the European War, the French capital was also threatened, but they were able to achieve the final victory. We all have the determination to die, and our blood and land are united as one. Even if the enemy uses its violence and penetrates deep into our interior, it will eventually be destroyed by us. As for the planning of finance, currency, and economy, the government has long made arrangements, and friendly nations have also provided much assistance. Therefore, no matter how long the resistance lasts, finances can be managed to the best of our ability. It is hoped that local officials will properly guide the people, each engaging in their respective professions, working hard with peace of mind, and managing their businesses with composure. This will be of great benefit to long-term resistance. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] After the seat of the Chinese government moved from Nanjing to Chongqing, the ambassadors of various countries held a major ambassadorial meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of embassy locations. The result was a decision to temporarily move to Hankou. Each embassy will leave a portion of its staff in Nanjing to form an international committee, attempting to establish a safe zone to protect the safety of foreigners when the Japanese army attacks Nanjing.

<h3>Pudong's Defenses Are Empty, Guarded by Puppet Police</h3>
<p>But the Area Remains Extremely Chaotic</p>
<p>After most of the enemy troops in Pudong were transferred to the front line for combat, the defenses were so empty that it was almost impossible to deploy guards. They had no choice but to accelerate the training of 150 puppet police officers recruited a few days ago. They wore yellow uniforms and carried wooden sticks, trying to resume their posts on Laiyi Wharf Street yesterday morning. When these puppet police officers initially applied, they only knew they were being sent to Pudong to help refugees, but once they entered the area, they lost all freedom and realized they had been fooled. They wanted to regret it, but it was too late. Therefore, some did not want to be controlled by others and took the opportunity to escape. The actual number is now less than 120, divided into three shifts day and night. Each shift has less than 40 people, standing dejectedly on the street under the armed supervision of the enemy, looking extremely miserable. The wharves along the Pudong River south of Lujiazui are still guarded by enemy soldiers. The enemy believes that the number of puppet police is too small, confined to a corner, and cannot be distributed, so most of the area remains in a chaotic state. Thieves run rampant, and it is impossible to cope with the situation. Therefore, they plan to continue recruiting a large number of puppet police, but the original old police officers all deeply understand the righteousness and have scattered to change careers, so recruitment is very difficult.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Supply Is Smooth, Prices Are Significantly Reduced</h3>
<p>Seafood and Other Types Are Still Extremely Scarce, Flour Prices Rose Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The source of vegetables in this city has gradually become smooth after the active dredging by various parties. Shandong, Nantong, and other places have transported vegetables, and those transported from Pudong are even more enthusiastic, with four to five transports from Gaoqiao every day. There are various vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage, green vegetables, and radishes, which are sufficient to meet the needs of this city. Therefore, prices have been significantly reduced in recent days. However, because it is difficult for fishermen to catch fresh fish, the market is still extremely scarce. The prices of fresh shrimp and river fish are extremely high, and it is not easy to buy them. Yesterday, the price of flour rose again, with each bag selling for 4.4 yuan in legal tender, and secondary flour costing 3.7 yuan, an increase of 0.25 yuan and 0.3 yuan respectively compared to before. Therefore, it is very difficult for the common people in this city to maintain their livelihoods amidst this high inflation. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will quickly find ways to suppress this trend.</p>
<h3>Two Groups Advocate One-Jiao Movement</h3>
<p>Cilianhui Suggests Implementation Measures</p>
<p>Cilianhui: The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's Committee for Relief of War-Zone Refugees yesterday approved the suggestion of Chen Jisheng to quickly promote a daily one-jiao movement to relieve compatriots in distress. The association has replied with its agreement and has decided to implement it immediately. The following are Chen's suggested measures: ㊀ Refugees need one jiao per person per day. It is hoped that each family can bear the food ration for one refugee, that is, donate one silver jiao (coin) per day, which can save one person's life. Donations of more are especially welcome. ㊁ The one-jiao donation can be deducted from the food expenses or by reducing one meal on Sundays, which is easy and affordable. ㊂ Each family should first fill out a subscription form, confirming the supply for one or several refugees. Then, every five days, the association will send someone to collect the donation and issue a receipt immediately. As for various groups or neighborhoods, they can recommend one representative to collect and submit the donations to the association, or the association can entrust one resident in each household to collect the donations. ㊃ The association will thoroughly investigate the number of refugees and properly allocate the funds donated by each family to the recipient refugees, and the names of the recipient refugees, the names and addresses of the shelters where they are located will be detailed on the notification slip, which will be given to the donors (or group/neighborhood representatives) for their records, so that they can visit the refugees who have received donations in the shelters on the dates stipulated by the association to inquire about the actual situation.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Wartime Service Corps of the Insurance Industry to launch a daily one-jiao movement to relieve refugees and asked for promotion, etc. The Chamber of Commerce then issued a notice to various trade associations to jointly advocate for it, stating: Upon investigation, the number of refugees temporarily sheltering in Shanghai is greater than before. Transportation is limited and cut off, and there is no way to send them back. The future is long, and we must plan a relief plan. The method suggested by the group is simple and easy to implement and more sustainable. We hereby request your association to inform your colleagues, widely advocate for it, and strive for its popularity, so that small contributions can add up to a great effect, and the survivors can avoid waiting for their end. We sincerely hope for this.</p>

<h3>Yangtze River Water Drops, Flood Warning Vessels Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Navigation in the Middle Reaches Gradually Becomes Difficult, Winter Low-Water Season Has Arrived</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water volume has passed the major flood season, and the winter low-water season is approaching, so the water level is dropping daily. The flood warning piles along the river have begun to be removed. The Datong News Agency reporter reports the following details:</p>
<p>Middle Reaches Water Drops</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs announced the following river gauge readings yesterday: Changsha 10 feet 9 inches, Yichang 10 feet 8 inches (above are the middle reaches), Jiujiang 14 feet 7 inches, Anqing 33 feet 4 inches, Wuhu 24 feet 2 inches, Zhenjiang 14 feet 4 inches. The water levels are dropping daily, especially in the middle reaches. Ships with excessive drafts are gradually finding it difficult to navigate upstream.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Flood Warning Vessels</p>
<p>During the major flood season, the flood warning lights and piles set up by the customs along the river have also begun to be removed, including ㊀ the special flood warning vessel for the Jiujiang section, ㊁ the lower light vessel of the Guijiaba South Waterway, and the Chiko light pile, and ㊂ the flood warning buoy at the lower end of the Anqing Waterway. The patrol company has notified all Chinese and foreign shipping companies in this port to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Marginalia from Lieshan</h3>
<p>— Feng Lieshan</p>
<p>Regarding the Smoking Question</p>
<p>It seems that Mr. Xu Zhimo once mentioned that the advantage of the education law at Oxford University in England lies in professors teaching students to smoke. He praised this smoking system, saying that after a few years, when these students go out into society, they immediately become authentic gentlemen. Mr. Xu probably overlooked the fact that most of the students at Oxford and Cambridge Universities are children of British nobles and wealthy families. Their future paths are almost ready-made, so he attributes this effect to smoking. In fact, the main purpose of these two universities is to produce ruling talents, not scientific experts. If smoking really has such a great connection with the cultivation of students, then all British people would have to become scholars. Reason: Smoking is an extremely common phenomenon in England.</p>
<p>A person who doesn't smoke does indeed have many difficulties coming to London. This is not to say that not smoking makes it impossible to be a gentleman. England not only has gentlemen who don't smoke, but they even organized a "No Smoking Society." The difficulty lies in encountering "cigarette smoke" everywhere. Not only on the streets, trams, subways, pubs, and cafes, but even in cinemas, theaters, and concerts, these gentlemen and ladies all smoke their cigarettes as much as possible. Sometimes, if you are unfortunate enough to sit next to a gentleman with a "cigarette addiction," you will have the opportunity to watch him smoke one cigarette after another. Especially many young girls love to do this. Even the British themselves find this phenomenon unpleasant. Recently, members of the "No Smoking Society" held a special meeting and petitioned the government to prohibit audiences from smoking in cinemas, theaters, and concerts. As a result, the British newspapers started a major discussion about the smoking issue. Some newspapers said that non-smokers seem to be in the minority. Since the majority of the audience wants to smoke, then the minority has no reason to force the majority. This newspaper said that the smoking issue is also closely related to business. Cinema owners have no way to stop the audience if the audience likes to smoke. Otherwise, their business will suffer losses. That newspaper said that smoking also has a harmonizing effect. Because many British films and dramas cannot be watched without smoking to pass the time and distract the mind, it is simply impossible to sit in the theater. Finally, another newspaper proposed imitating the New York cinema method, which is that smoking is allowed upstairs, but not downstairs. Naturally, this is a good compromise method, but whether it will work is still a question. Because this smoking habit, which has almost become a custom, is probably not easy to change for a while.</p>
<p>The opposite is true in Germany. Smoking is not allowed in German cinemas and theaters. There are also considerable restrictions on smoking in public places, especially for women. If a German woman occasionally smokes in public, she is often subject to "public opinion sanctions" from men. There is a popular saying in Germany: "German women do not smoke." I remember once hearing a man in his thirties warn a fashionable woman at a train station: "German women do not smoke." But the smoking woman calmly turned around and said: "I am Swiss. What does German women have to do with me, you say?" ㊁ Another joke. It is said that one day, a German lady was smoking in a cafe. Her behavior immediately aroused the displeasure of several men. One of the male customers volunteered to write a note saying "German women do not smoke" and sent it to the lady as a warning. The lady added a few words to the note and immediately returned it to him. When they opened it and read it, everyone was silent. It turned out that the lady replied, "German men only have wives, not mistresses!"</p>
<p>Two years ago, the youth of the National Socialist Party not only strongly supported the slogan "German women do not smoke," but also had the determination to make it a reality. Later, because of the wife of Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, who was a smoking female comrade, the slogan was finally abolished. In German social circles, many foreigners love to joke with German ladies about the smoking issue. When they refuse to smoke, they say: "German wives (the German word "Frau" has both the meanings of woman and wife) do not smoke, but you are a German Miss!"</p>

<h3>Jiaying Steamer Arrives in Shanghai with Rice, Unloading to Be Handled Today</h3>
<p>Rice Traders Send Representatives to Take Charge of Matters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the South China Rice Industry Company have jointly purchased foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply. The first batch of 25,000 bags of rice aboard the Jiaying Steamer arrived in Shanghai the night before last. Due to incomplete procedures, unloading is scheduled for today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dispatching Representatives to Preside – The Rice Traders Association has designated 500 member rice shops to receive foreign rice from the Municipal Council for retail sales to maintain the food supply. The association has dispatched members Huang Ruquan, Su Boxun, Gu Yuqing, etc., along with staff, to be responsible for handling the rice receipt procedures. The Public Concession and French Concession police will each send 20 Chinese constables to protect the vehicles.</p>
<p>Unloading Rice Today – The Jiaying Steamer of the British Swire Company, carrying 25,000 bags of Saigon rice, arrived in Shanghai the night before last and is anchored in the Jiang River outside the French Avenue Bund. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd., a British firm at 181 Jiangxi Road, which directly ordered from Saigon, is scheduled to send staff to the pier today, displaying a banner with the words "Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd.," to handle the unloading and transportation of the rice. Barges will be used to unload the rice from the Jiaying Steamer and transport it to the Bund on Second Horse Road, where it will be loaded onto trucks and transported to various shops for retail sales.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Compatriots Relief Association Cables Provincial Authorities to Allocate Funds for Relief</h3>
<p>Over 50,000 Refugees on the Verge of Starvation – Saving the People with Poverty Relief Funds</p>
<p>The Relief Committee of the Songjiang Sojourners Association in Shanghai has sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request the allocation of funds to actively raise funds to relieve refugees from Songjiang who have sought refuge in Shanghai. Yesterday, it also submitted a petition to the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to allocate the remaining 30,000 yuan from the Songjiang County grain reserve to provide relief to the disaster victims. The original petition stated, "Since the August 13th Resistance Against Japan, Songjiang, being close to Shanghai, has been ravaged by the enemy. In mid-March, it was bombed hundreds of times, with over a thousand bombs dropped. The flourishing markets have been turned into scorched earth. The surviving people are displaced and homeless, suffering from hunger and cold, crying out to the heavens without response. Although we have tried our best to raise donations and find ways to provide relief, since the entire county was captured on the 8th of this month, the people have risked their lives to escape the disaster. Those who have asked the way to Shanghai number over 50,000, living in the open and exposed to the elements, on the verge of starvation. Their inhuman lives are unbearable to witness. Therefore, we implore your Excellency, with your compassionate heart for those who are hungry and drowning, to save these people who are in deep distress. Please allocate the remaining 30,000 yuan from the Songjiang County grain reserve to provide relief to the disaster victims of Songjiang. Using local funds to save the local people, using poverty relief funds to meet the urgent needs of disaster relief, the names are consistent and the uses are appropriate, so that the people know that the government has a sincere intention to love the people, and unity will be strengthened from now on, so that they will not be instigated by the enemy. The local area will be fortunate, and the refugees will be fortunate."</p>
<h3>Fire Once Broke Out in the Refugee Area on the Republic Road</h3>
<p>Fire Was Extremely Fierce – Burning for Four Hours</p>
<p>Yesterday at 8:50 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the area of the Baohhetang Chinese Pharmacy on the Republic Road (opposite Jixiang Road in the French Concession). Smoke filled the air, and the situation was extremely fierce. After the French Concession authorities received the news, they immediately dispatched multiple fire trucks to extinguish the fire. However, due to the extremely fierce fire, it was not extinguished until around 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Hospitals Established in Refugee Areas</h3>
<p>Medical Supplies Needed</p>
<p>After the guard and sanitation matters in the refugee area of Nanshi were handled, the Chinese Medical Association recently established a general hospital and a maternity hospital in the area, providing free medical treatment. The health of the refugees has been guaranteed. Because they are suffering from hunger and cold, many suffer from abdominal pain and diarrhea. There are many people seeking treatment, but the hospital only has 100 beds, which is not enough. Therefore, they are trying to expand and add more beds, and are requesting donations of medicines and equipment from the outside world. The registration of residents in the area is also underway. It is estimated that there are 50,000 households and about 70,000 refugees in the area. The former can be self-sufficient, but there is no way to buy rice and firewood in the area, so they also rely on the relief association's relief. Currently, 500,000 to 600,000 loaves of bread are transported in daily, which costs a lot. Therefore, the association is also trying to transport rice and firewood in for sale to reduce the burden. As for the negotiations to expand the refugee area, they are still under discussion.</p>
<p>According to news from the International Relief Association, in the refugee area of Nanshi, due to the cold weather recently, the refugees are thinly clad, resulting in a large number of people suffering from illness and moaning on the ground. Many have died without receiving treatment. The association has established a temporary hospital in the area to provide diagnosis and treatment at any time. However, due to the large number of people, there is a severe shortage of medicines. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will quickly donate generously to save the dying refugees.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Line Resumes Navigation as Usual</h3>
<p>De Ping to Leave for Ningbo This Afternoon – One Trip Every Other Day Thereafter</p>
<p>Since the blockade of Zhenhai Port, Ningbo-bound ships have been prohibited from sailing since the 17th. For days, the Ningbo Sojourners Association has been sending telegrams to Ningbo, requesting the local Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the Zhenhai Fortress Headquarters. As a result, resumption of navigation has been approved. The De Ping of the Huayi Shipping Company in Shanghai is allowed to leave Shanghai for Ningbo as usual at 3:00 PM today. In the future, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been temporarily permitted by the Fortress Headquarters to operate as usual, as agreed upon by the Sojourners Association, etc. However, when the ship arrives at Zhenhai Port, the Fortress Headquarters must send a pilot to guide it into the port, and it must not enter on its own. However, in case of necessity, the Fortress Headquarters may still order the suspension of navigation at any time. Currently, the De Ping of the Huayi Company will operate one trip every other day to transport refugees to Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Refugees Suffering from Hunger and Cold – Various Charitable Organizations Actively Providing Relief</h3>
<p>Guangyu Society Broadcasts – Pleads for Refugees</p>
<p>The Disaster Relief Association of charitable organizations in Shanghai, in view of the fact that there are still many refugees wandering on the streets and in various alleys who have not yet been accommodated, and at this cold time, it is often heard that such people are dying from hunger and cold while sleeping in the streets, the association dispatched a large number of vehicles to various places yesterday to take in refugees, totaling more than 100 people. There were also several corpses, all elderly people, who were handed over for burial. The entire staff of the Guangyu Society, Huang Chilin, Xia Hesheng, Chen Ruilin, etc., in view of the large number of refugees in Shanghai and the difficulty in providing for them, specially broadcast a special program on the Oriental Radio Station on Yuchaqing Road from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM every day, pleading for generous relief from all walks of life for the refugees. However, those from all walks of life who generously donate money, goods, or warm clothes and quilts are requested to send them directly to the relief agencies for acceptance.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the China Lǐ Religion General Association held a joint meeting yesterday, chaired by Zhang Yichen. They discussed: ㊀ The Shanghai Fushuntang Guild Hall, led by Ren Xipeng, established eight shelters. Please review and request that personnel be sent to provide guidance. The resolution was to approve the record and send Commissioner Pu Yusheng to inspect. ㊁ The Shanghai Puyuandang Guild Hall reported that in addition to the three floors of the guild hall being used to accommodate refugees from five counties, including Dantu, it is self-operating a shelter on the second floor. Please review. The resolution was to approve the record. ㊂ The case of establishing a shelter on Beijing Road by the association was resolved to send staff member Zhang Yinglong to be responsible for handling it. ㊃ The Wuxi China Lǐ Religion Women and Children Relief Association sent a letter reporting the establishment situation. Please notify all Lǐ Religion guild halls. The resolution was to pass it. ㊄ The Gansu Jingyuan Zhiyi Hall Guild Hall sent a letter requesting registration. The resolution was to reply by letter with an attached form. ㊅ The Rugao Faxintang Guild Hall sent a letter setting a date for establishment and requesting that local agencies be transferred to protect the case. The resolution was to approve it.</p>
<p>The Young Women's Christian Association at 999 Jing'an Temple Road once established a shelter for women and children refugees at the Sino-Western Second Elementary School. Later, because the elementary school opened, it had to close down. It then planned to find another address to establish a shelter for unemployed women. However, because the address has not yet been found, the plan has not been realized yet. It was decided to move the boarding house in Yuqing Lane on Roberts Road to be part of the shelter, which can accommodate 40 to 50 people. In a few days, the quota was full. The association has sent people to teach handicrafts, sewing, and the production of special nutritious soybean milk, etc., and to introduce jobs to enable them to support themselves. In addition, the association raised a large number of old clothes and distributed them to the refugees. In recent days, a total of 914 old clothes have been distributed to eight refugee shelters, including the 3rd, 31st, 71st, 93rd, 97th, New World, Buddhist Jingye Society, and Baowang. It also sent ten bags of flour and 100 cotton vests to the refugees in Nanshi. It will continue to distribute in the future and actively seek wide empty houses or squares as places to accommodate unemployed women. It is hoped that all circles will help in the search. Those who have houses are requested to notify the association immediately.</p>
<p>The Jiangyin Sojourners Association in Shanghai has sent more than 200 fellow villagers back to their hometowns. Due to inconvenient transportation, there are still many fellow villagers stranded in Shanghai. In addition to actively trying to send them back as much as possible, those who are more miserable and unable to make a living are sent directly to the Zhi Sheng Shan Yuan for temporary accommodation to avoid sleeping on the streets and suffering from wind and rain.</p>
<h3>Charcoal Industry Asks Authorities of Two Concessions to Negotiate for the Release of Cargo Ships from Nanshi</h3>
<p>Extreme Shortage of Charcoal – If No Measures Are Taken to Extract it, the People Will Run Out of Food and Social Peace Will Be Affected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charcoal Industry Association wrote to the authorities of the two concessions this morning, saying, "According to members Guangseng, Yongda, Jinmaoji, and other charcoal firms, we have purchased charcoal from various mountainous areas in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou in Zhejiang Province, and transported it to Shanghai to provide relief, as instructed by your association. Later, due to the westward movement of our troops, the subsequent batches of cargo ships were blocked on the Pujiang River near the Nanshi Water Plant and Qiuxin Factory, totaling more than a dozen ships, worth millions. When our troops withdrew, these cargo ships were even more unable to pass through. At this time of extreme shortage of charcoal, if no measures are taken to extract it, the people of this city will inevitably run out of food. We request that your association send letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession Authority to quickly take measures to negotiate with the Japanese side for early release to meet the essential needs of the residents of the area and maintain peace," etc. Charcoal is an essential fuel for the daily use of the people and cannot be cut off for a single day. It is of great importance to the livelihood of the people and social peace. Therefore, we hereby request your bureau to investigate and approve the rapid negotiation with the Japanese side to release the detained cargo ships as soon as possible to meet civilian needs. We will be immensely grateful.</p>
<h3>Transportation Not Resolved, Factories Still Difficult to Resume Work</h3>
<p>Concession Authorities Can Provide Practical Assistance – All Difficulties Will Be Easily Solved</p>
<p>In order to promote the early resumption of work in various factories for the purpose of settling refugees, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession sent Mr. Heder, the head of the Industrial Section, to negotiate with the Shanghai West United Welfare Association and expressed its willingness to do its utmost to provide practical assistance. After investigation by the association, as the war has moved inward in recent days, all areas of the city have returned to a safe state, and the factories have indeed begun to prepare to resume work one after another. However, the most serious and difficult problem at present is the transportation problem. It is found that several British-owned textile factories have been operating for many days and producing a lot. Recently, due to the interruption of transportation and the lack of sources, they will temporarily stop work. In addition, the Chinese-owned Fuxin Tobacco Company, which opened day and night shifts ten days ago to rush the production of mountain goods, was still worried that it would not meet the demand, but now it also has to reduce the number of shifts due to inconvenient transportation and the inability to transport the inventory out of the port, and a large number of workers have been laid off. In addition, there are also factories that have resumed part of their work, and there are also those who are watching and hesitating, all because the transportation problem has not been resolved, which makes them hesitate and hesitate. It is now learned that the chairman of the association, Zhuang Ping, is scheduled to visit Mr. Heder within days to discuss everything, and believes that the transportation and raw material problems should be assisted by the Municipal Council and given a practical guarantee. Then all difficulties can be easily solved, and all factories can resume work uniformly.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Asks Zhejiang Provincial Government to Issue Passports for Rice Purchasing in Taiwan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, saying, "To the Zhejiang Provincial Government, according to a letter from the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, according to a letter from our member Changyiheng Bank, since the war in this city moved westward, the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, Songjiang, and western Zhejiang have been turned into war zones, resulting in the disappearance of sources. The people's food supply in this city is worrying. It is now found that the transportation in Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, is still convenient, and this year's harvest there is also abundant, with a lot of surplus rice. We dare to ask your association to transfer the request to your association to prepare a document and submit it to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for review and approval, and immediately issue 10,000 passports to Taizhou to purchase rice for dispatching personnel to purchase and transport it to this city to relieve the people's food supply, etc. We hereby urgently transfer the request to your association to issue a certificate immediately and transfer it to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to issue a document for 10,000 passports for purchasing and transporting rice to Taizhou, so that it can be transported to Shanghai to relieve the people's food supply, which is really a great convenience," etc. The association, after checking, found that the transportation between this city and western Zhejiang and Jiangsu has been cut off, and the supply of rice is almost exhausted. It can only rely on the foreign rice stored in the Municipal Council for retail sales, which is difficult to rely on as a permanent inexhaustible source. According to the situation in the letter, it is really an urgent rescue plan. It is reasonable to telegram your government for review and approval, and to issue a passport for Changyi Bank to purchase 10,000 bags of rice in Taiwan to facilitate transportation and relieve the people's food supply, which is really a public convenience. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows.</p>
<h3>Shipping Between Shanghai and the United States to Resume Soon</h3>

At that time, shipping between Shanghai and the United States will resume according to the original method of sailing once a week, in order to transport passengers and goods.</p>
<h3>Funeral of Doctor Niu Huilin Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Coffin is Temporarily Placed in the Funeral Home – The Medical Community to Hold a Memorial Service</p>
<p>After the death of bone specialist Dr. Niu Huilin, all circles in China and abroad deeply mourned the sudden death of Dr. Niu, a generation of famous doctors.

<h3>Money Exchange Association Announces Caution in Accepting Notes</h3>
<p>Avoid All Unexpected Disputes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Exchange Association, in view of the fact that recently, various newspapers have published advertisements for cash discounting, buying and selling gold and silver currencies of various countries, and public bonds and stocks, because the buying and selling of gold and silver currencies of various countries is the exclusive business approved by the competent authorities of the association, and non-members are not allowed to engage in it according to law. The creditworthiness of the various companies that publish advertisements for discounting and are not members of the association is unknown. For fear that this will affect the reputation of the members of the association, it has issued a special statement, "In this extraordinary period, all note acceptance and acceptance should be more cautious to avoid unexpected disputes." A reporter from the New Voice Agency inquired with the association yesterday and learned that the members of the association are divided into three levels: Fulushou. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, members north of the Suzhou River have been forced to suspend business. The members whose main business is the buying and selling of currencies of various countries are: Xiehe Gong, Baokang, Tiancheng, Qiantai, Hongda, Xiangyuan, Cunyi, Hengmao, Yongtai, Baocheng, Shengtai, Zhentai, Tongkang, Baoxiang, Santai, Huikang, Dingxiang, Wantai, Chengmao, F茂, Dongtai, and Hexing. , deposit benefits, etc.</p>

However, the Xiqu Fire Station, where the Japanese army once stationed its headquarters the day before yesterday, was also burned down the night before last, leaving only the cement shell. In the city, the fire in Jinjiafang on Fangbang Road has burned eastward to the periphery of Shipinong, and one end has penetrated Kongjia Lane along the Republic Road. The fire is still burning fiercely. The fire on Jingtin Road, Dadongmen, has been heading west and will soon reach the vicinity of Xun Dao Street and Qiaojia Road. The fire in front of Guangfu Temple has been burning eastward. The Wangjia Wharf and Dada Wharf area on the Bund are still raging. The fires in Dananmen and Xiaonanmen have been slightly quelled. Other places such as Penglai Road, Wenmiao Road, and Xicang Road are still burning severely.</p>
<p>Pudong: Yesterday, the weather turned sunny. In Pudong, around 9:00 AM, three tongues of fire extended again. One was near the garbage pond at the north end of Zhongshi, Yangjiadu. The fire was extremely fierce, and a thick smoke rose into the sky. Because no one was there to rescue it, it gradually died down around 1:00 PM. About 50 or 60 houses were destroyed. Another fire broke out near Laobaidu. The fire was slightly less than Yangjiadu, but it also burned for a long time, until it weakened around 2:00 PM. More than 40 houses were destroyed. There was also a fire in the eastern end of Shenjia Nong's Dongshi End. The area was relatively deserted and close to the countryside. There were very few houses connected to each other, but the burning time was also more than three hours. It is estimated that more than 30 houses were destroyed. Around 0:00 PM in the afternoon, the Xiyangjiazhai at the eastern end of Tongxing Street, Lujiazhai Road, and the Dongyangjiazhai at the south end of the Tianzhang Paper Factory both ignited flames one after another. The burning was fierce. Because the bungalows were closely packed together, the fire spread quite widely. After about two hours of burning, the total number of houses destroyed in both places was more than 100.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Achievements Still Quite Impressive</h3>
<p>The eighth team of the second special district group of the Shanghai City National Salvation Public Bond Fundraising Headquarters has worked exceptionally hard.

<h3>Yunnan Road Murder Case Suspect Arrested</h3>
<p>Tour Agency Owner Refuses to Pay Wages, Accountant Commits Murder Resulting in Tragedy</p>
<p>In the upstairs of 259 Yunnan Road, a murder case occurred at 6:00 AM on the 19th of this month. The deceased was named Lu Fusheng. The details were previously reported in the newspaper. Now, after investigation by Chinese detectives Chen Yonggui and Nie Youwen of the Old Zha Police Station, the suspect, Ji Yongyu (24 years old) from Jiangyin, was arrested at 12:15 PM the day before yesterday at No. 18, Lane 574, Tiantong Road. According to Ji's confession, the deceased previously opened the Yelai Xiang Tour Agency at No. 9 Yuren Lane, Yunnan Road, and hired him as an accountant, stating that the monthly salary would be 15 yuan, but a deposit of 60 yuan was required. Ji paid the full amount. However, after starting the job, due to poor business, no salary was paid. Later, Lu closed Yelai Xiang and opened the Liuguo Tour Agency on Yu Qiaqing Road, which also failed shortly after and was moved to the scene of the incident, renamed Mima Dianma. Ji followed him all the time, managing money. Recently, Lu Fusheng not only did not pay Ji's due wages, but also planned to drive Ji away, leading to frequent quarrels. On the morning of the 19th, another dispute occurred. Ji, in anger, struck Lu's head several times with the lid of a stove, causing serious injuries and death. He was sent to the Special First Court yesterday morning, and the police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered a postponement of the trial.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhuxuan Case Retrial</h3>
<p>Court Hearing on the 29th of This Month</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan from Yancheng, the former owner of the Tianchan Stage, was previously implicated in the case of instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, based on the accusation of the convicted murderer Zhao Guangfu, who was arrested. The French police arrested Gu and sent him to the Special Second Court, where he was prosecuted for murder. After trial, Gu was sentenced to 15 years in prison and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights. Because Gu did not agree, he appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The result of the trial was that the original judgment was revoked and he was declared not guilty. During the appeal period, he was still detained in the detention center. Later, because the French Police Department disagreed with the second instance judgment, they petitioned the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. Later, Gu requested the Third Branch of the High Court to stop the detention, and it was ruled that he could be released on bail with a cash deposit of 7,000 yuan, plus a guarantee of 10,000 yuan that he would be available whenever summoned, and three jointly and severally liable guarantors. The Supreme Court has reviewed the entire case file and believes that there are many doubts in the case that have not been clarified. Therefore, the second instance judgment was revoked and the entire case file was sent back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. As reported in this newspaper, it is now known that the case has been handled by Judge Wang Yue of the Criminal Court of the Third Branch of the High Court. After reviewing the case file and the reasons for the Supreme Court's judgment, it is heard that subpoenas have been issued, and the court hearing is scheduled for the 29th of this month to summon Gu Zhuxuan and the Chinese and foreign detectives of the French Police Department who handled the case to the court for investigation and questioning.</p>

<h3>Local Weather Suddenly Turns Cold Yesterday</h3>
<p>The High Tide of the Huangpu River Has Begun to Subside</p>
<p>The rain in the local area stopped yesterday, and the weather was clear, but the north wind was biting and the temperature suddenly dropped sharply, causing the refugees stranded on the streets to be overwhelmed by the cold. It was a miserable sight. It is also learned that the high winds on the Huangpu River are expected to subside starting today. However, the continuous surge has severely affected warehouses and godowns, and the accumulation of water on the roads makes walking even more difficult.</p>
<h3>Cutting Off Water Supply During Extraordinary Times Should Be Handled with Great Caution</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Has Obtained the Company's Promise</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the fourteen district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, stating, "We have received a reply from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, which states, 'Regarding your letter of October 28 concerning the protest of tenants in Jinshou Lane, Shandong Road, against the water company's plan to cut off the water supply due to overdue water bills, we have checked that the water supply in the lane is based on contracts signed by the landlords. Because the water bills have been overdue for three months, the company has issued a final notice, and individual notices have also been given for the sake of the tenants. As mentioned in your letter, the water company cannot continue to supply water due to overdue water bills, which your association is well aware of. The council has obtained the company's promise to exercise extreme caution when exercising the right to cut off the water supply due to overdue water bills during this extraordinary period,' etc. We are hereby informing you accordingly for your reference."</p>
<h3>Police Station Notifies Businesses of Anti-Theft Alarm Measures</h3>
<p>Recently, theft cases have occurred frequently in the Public Concession. Although the police station has stepped up prevention and ordered strict investigation, the residents' careful defense is also important. Therefore, yesterday, the police station ordered staff to separately notify various businesses of defense methods and emergency notification methods for alerting the police after an incident. If these methods can be effectively implemented, theft cases will surely be reduced.</p>
<h3>Measures for Distributing Salaries to Long-Term Police Officers Transferred to the French Concession</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the Shanghai Police Bureau was ordered to close down, the bureau specially issued the following announcement regarding the distribution of salaries and savings: "After investigation, the bureau was ordered to close down, and all salaries of officials and police officers for October were delivered to the captains of each branch bureau and team on the 14th of this month for distribution. However, for the long-term police officers transferred to the French Concession, the French police station has checked the names and number of people. After verification, the chiefs of the respective departments will be notified to go and distribute the salaries to show solemnity. As for the refund of the savings of all long-term police officers, except for the Police General Team, which has always handled it by themselves and has been ordered to comply, the savings of the captains of the other branch bureaus and teams should be assigned personnel to check the photos according to the submitted lists and distribute them together. This is specially announced."</p>
<h3>Two Thieves Caught on Barton Road</h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday, the Xinzha Police Station received a report that thieves were hiding inside No. 65 Barton Road. After the police chief received the report, he immediately sent detectives to arrest them. Two thieves were caught on the spot, and a Mauser pistol and seven rounds of ammunition were found. They were all taken to the police station for handling.</p>
<h3>Aviation Meteorology Expert Huang Xiaqian Returns to China</h3>
<p>Hired by National Central University, Passing Through Shanghai and Hong Kong, Will Arrive in Chongqing Within Days</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Xiaqian is from Nantong County, Jiangsu Province. He was a professor at Tsinghua University for seven years and was given a year of sabbatical leave as usual. He studied at the University of California, USA, at public expense, majoring in aviation meteorology. He studied diligently and deeply for three years. This autumn, he completed his studies, passed several examinations, and submitted a thesis. After formal approval by the Examination Committee, he was awarded a doctorate. Mr. Huang is the first Chinese student in the United States to receive a doctorate in aviation meteorology. President Luo of National Central University repeatedly telegraphed to invite him to return to take up a teaching position. Mr. Huang then boarded the British ship Empress of Japan at the beginning of the month and set off to return to China. He recently passed through Shanghai and Hong Kong and detoured to Sichuan. He will arrive in Chongqing within days.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association Concerned About Hometown News</h3>
<p>Suzhou has suffered a great disaster, and Dongting Mountain has also been bombed. The Shanghai Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association is very concerned. If fellow villagers know the current situation of their hometown, please go to the association at the intersection of Daxing Road, Xinzha Road, to report, or call Mr. You Huaigao of Ziyou Farm, telephone number 30430.</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital's October Report</h3>
<p>Renji Hospital's October report states: 17,004 outpatient visits, 589 inpatients, 8,273 inpatient days, an average of 570 people fed per day, 15 male suicides, 23 female suicides, 195 inpatient surgeries, 261 outpatient surgeries, 10 factory accidents and injuries, 467 patients sent by the Public Concession Police Station, 17 patients sent by the French Concession Police Station, 13 patients sent by the Chinese Public Security Bureau, 42 deliveries, 17,593 prescriptions, 488 X-ray photographs, 5,161 total inpatient days, and 1,635 total outpatient visits.</p>
<p>The refugee problem in October had a significant impact on the hospital's work. It can be imagined from the fact that there are already 70,000 to 80,000 refugees in the refugee camps, and those living elsewhere are not included. It is reported that many refugees in the refugee camps are seriously ill and need to be hospitalized for treatment, but the bed facilities in all hospitals in the Shanghai Concession are not sufficient to accommodate all of them. The number of beds occupied by the hospital every day is about 375 or more, but the hospital is only a hospital with 230 beds. Therefore, the hospital had to set up temporary beds in various departments for accommodation, and the hospital's important problem is no longer whether there are empty beds, but whether there is floor space to set up these temporary beds.</p>
<p>The number of free inpatient days was more than 5,161 days, and there were 1,625 free outpatient visits. The hospital is very grateful to the Shanghai Red Cross Society for donating funds for this work. The average donation for each inpatient was 50 cents, and the donation for each outpatient was 5 cents.</p>
<p>The increase in inpatients is due to the fact that surgical treatments for inpatients have increased by almost 20%. The hospital's obstetrics department continued to make progress, with 42 deliveries in October, a new record for the hospital. Last month's record was 39. Summer illnesses have decreased, but illnesses caused by the hardships of the previous three months have increased. Malnutrition has been found in both internal and surgical patients. The food that poor patients eat in normal times is only enough to maintain their health on the horizontal line, and at present, the deterioration of food has serious consequences. If they had been well-nourished, the diseases they developed would have been very minor.</p>
<p>Among the useful donations received this month was an iron medical box, which is now placed in the emergency department. In the event of an emergency injury, the box can be carried to the scene. The box can hold first-aid bandages and medicines. This box was donated by Miss Adelaime through fundraising for three friends. It has been used several times in October. In addition, the hospital received various donations and supplies. The names of the donors are listed below to express our gratitude: Mrs. Stock, Mrs. Uliston, Mrs. Yang (transliteration), Reid School of the China Inland Mission (fundraised by Miss Barton), Mrs. Hammond, colleagues of the Renji Hospital Women's Assistant Team, the YWCA, Miss Zhuang (transliteration), colleagues of the Western staff of the Continental Daily News, Rev. E.G. Ottewcll, Mrs. Liddell of the China Women's Association, the Christian Women's Association (Leeds Women's Guild of Ohristiau Serviee), Dr. A.O. Price.</p>
<h3>Wang Wenyu and Si Yigui Perform in Rigoletto</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Opera House at the Jardin Dancing Hall on Rue Lafayette will perform the opera Rigoletto, a masterpiece by the French composer Offenbach, tonight. Admiring the names of our Chinese singing masters, Mrs. Wang Wenyu and Si Yigui, they were invited to join the singing. Mrs. Wang Wenyu is from Guangdong and has studied Western opera for many years. Her singing voice is excellent and unparalleled. She plays the role of Gilda in the play, which is very demanding in singing and acting. Si Yigui grew up in Shanghai and has always been well-cultivated. He has performed in Shanghai's string orchestras several times and enjoys a great reputation. This collaboration is a perfect match, and it is especially rare to sing in Italian. To regulate the spirit of the Shanghai people, the prices are very cheap, ranging from 50 cents to 3 yuan. Seats can be reserved at the Robison Company at 276 Jiangxi Road.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Park Report</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Municipal Council Park Supervisor, routine work in the parks south of the Suzhou River continued as usual in October. The total number of visitors to the parks was 38,956. The records of meteorological instruments in Jiaozhou Park are as follows:</p>
<h3>Lido Theater Reopens</h3>
<p>Patriotic Loyalists in Troubled Times Screening on the 26th</p>
<p>The Lido Theater, known for its low prices and excellent facilities, will reopen on the 26th of this month, screening famous films made by various film companies to entertain the audience. The seat prices remain the same, with 30 cents for the downstairs and 50 cents and 80 cents for the upstairs, day and night. Also, the Grand Refugee Relief Concert initiated by the National Conservatory of Music was originally scheduled to be performed at the theater at 8:00 PM on the 25th, but it has been postponed for some reason.</p>
<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Balance of Power and Isolation</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Historically, China has been able to gradually develop in modern times by relying on the balance of power among the great powers. In recent years, Japan's blatant acts of aggression have awakened the awareness of our entire nation to fight for self-reliance. At the same time, it has also broken the balance of power among the great powers in China. The result of the former is the current large-scale full-scale war of resistance. The result of the latter is that Japan is in a position of isolation.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan seems to be able to save Japan from its painful state of isolation. In fact, even if the strengths of Germany, Italy, and Japan are combined, they are far from being able to match the strength of all peaceful countries. Moreover, the interests of the three countries are different. It is still doubtful whether this combination can last for a long time. At present, Japan can certainly use this pact as a weapon to make the peaceful countries of the world afraid of the expansion of war and maintain a wait-and-see attitude towards China's fate. But can this situation remain unchanged?</p>
<p>I think change is bound to come. Recently, British diplomatic activities have had significant success in Europe. The Spanish issue is about to be resolved due to the Soviet Union's concession. The meeting between Halifax and Hitler is said to have been very satisfactory. Obviously, Britain's efforts are to stabilize the European situation and prevent it from being affected by the war in the Far East. If this goal can be achieved, the European and American powers can use their full strength to deal with the crisis in the Far East.</p>
<p>In any case, the crisis in the Far East is something that the European and American powers cannot ignore. Japan's use of the Anti-Comintern Pact to relieve its own painful isolation may not be very effective.</p>
