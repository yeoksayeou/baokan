<p>［漢口］路透訪員分訪此間中國領袖、探詢意見、彼等皆極坦白談論中國抗戰失敗之原因、謂華北與京滬綫之失敗、雖皆視為不可免者、但實現較政府任何員之預料為早、華北失敗之主因、由於政治者多、由於軍事者少、中央政府對宋閻韓之軍隊、從不抱多大希望、此輩舊時代之軍人領袖、皆玩“騎牆”把戲、彼等對中央表示忠誠、而願對日抗戰、同時又對日方獻媚軍興之初、彼等皆襲陷於絕望之地位、旣無組織、又無準備、致宋哲元被逐於冀省、劉汝明被逐於察省、今閻錫山亦失晋省地盤、韓復榘之不保於魯、或可豫决、華北軍事失敗之另一原因、為營長以上之軍官、除絕少數外、皆不勝指揮之任、彼等未受新時代戰爭之訓練、且泰半富有資產故不願捐軀疆塲、華北大戰諸役、皆由中央軍隊為之、南口由湯恩伯與衛立煌之軍隊衛守、忻口由郝夢齡</p>

<p>［東京］㊀不承認蔣介石將軍之政府、㊁進行擴大之戰事、㊂輔助新中國建設、據半官消息、閣員意見大致如下、㊀目前之局勢、乃由蔣介石將軍企圖藉抗日政策告成中國之統一而釀成、故日本甚難與蔣介石將軍談判、以恢復和平、㊁中國當局之倡和平、乃因身處困難之局勢而致然、顯然缺乏誠意、彼等並未醒悟東方之幸福與和平主義、僅圖脫離目前之難關、㊂如蔣介石將軍之政府因南京之陷落而編為地方政府、則日本當然輔助華化與華中新起之運動、便利其造成重有生氣的新中國、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>［東京］陸軍首腦部九日上午十一時半開會梅津次官、町尻軍務局長·參謀本部多田次長·本間第二部長等出席、關於軍部應付事變第二階段之最高方針、有所協議、更於下午召開陸海外務大廬四省聯席會議、協議日政府今後應採取方針、據聞其結果、日本拒絕一切第三國之調停、及中國託第三國進行之任何和平交涉、應向出征之最後目的邁進、故日本旣定方針不可變動云（十日同盟電）、</p>
<p>［漢口］中日爭案和平解决之希望、已在此間迅速消滅，中政府領袖似皆信日本在此次戰爭中、不須接受德國之調解、德國所表示準備預為中立之調人、但迄今未作進行中日議和談判之正式提供、德大使陶德曼最近入京與蔣委員長會談話、僅向中國方面探詢可否開始和平談判、南京雖曾討論全問題、但未商妥切實或具體之條件、陶使由京返此後、目下不復企圖賡續在京之談話、據此間消息、全問題現已暫擱、以待日本願意接受調解時、再事活動審愼注意東京外務省所發表文告之華員、皆信日本决計攻佔南京、然後於相當期內、在該處設立一種行政機關、且覺日本將堅主與中國直接談判、其議和條件終將直接送交中政府而不經德國調人之手、但此種手續、中國决不接受、按在陶使入京之際、此間人士皆以為和平甚有希望、華人各界皆以為德國旣與中日兩國親善、必將保證提出可由雙方接受之和平條件、惟日軍之積極進攻南京、與東京外務省最近發表之文告、已完全改變此間之空氣、中政府諸領袖皆信中國今舍繼續抗戰外、別無他道、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>德不與日合流保時對華友誼</h3>
<p>［柏林］關於日本方面所傳日軍攻下南京之後、该国政府卽擬撤消承認國民政府一說·德國半官界人士頃宣稱德國興日本雖訂防共協定、但德國對於蔣介石將軍所主持之政府、仍當維持現行關係、此間中國人士則以為、日本方面所傳一說卽使成為事實、亦無關重要、蓋中日戰事仍在進行之中、蔣介石將軍原已决定抗戰至最後一兵一彈、是則日本卽使取消承認國民政府、實亦無足重視云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>意决定退出國聯醞釀國際新集團</h3>
<p>德意日反共公約爲骨幹　意最高行政會今日開會</p>
<p>［羅馬］意相墨索里尼將於星期六在維尼齊亞宮之露台上、宣布意大利退出國聯之消息傳出後、羅馬已充滿緊張期待之空氣、此項消息頃刻問已傳播全國、據稱、意大利退出國聯後、將與日德兩國更形密切、墨氏之思想中、或擬以防共公約爲核心、而形成一種新的國家集團、多數意國人士預料此次南斯拉夫首相斯多瓦的諾維區報聘羅馬之結果、將造成多瑙河流坡一種新秩序、惟路透社已向負責方面探悉、南國首相在訪問羅馬之際、並未提及南國加入防共公約問題云、聞意大利退出國聯之宣言、大約將於星期六晚十時法西斯最高行政會議開會後公布、此項會議之時間將不出數分鐘、不過靜聆墨索里尼之提議、並表示贊成而已、屆時大約將有多數民衆靜候墨氏之宣布、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］此間晨報今日咸稱、意國退出國聯之後、實際上將另行成立一種“法西斯聯盟”以反共恊定爲其骨幹、而以柏林爲其總機關所在地、名記者塔布衣夫人謂此項消息、已使日內瓦法西斯國家之代表團駭異莫名、預料瑞士或將要求國聯另遷新址云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］關於意國决定退出國聯會一事、法西斯黨最高會議明日開會時、首相墨索里尼當鄭重加以宣佈、此舉實乃首相去年十一月一日本年八月二十日在米蘭城與巴萊摩城兩次演說之當然的結果、緣首相當時曾一再聲明、意國政策乃欲與英法兩國成立諒解、但以國聯盟約或予以修正或則擱置不談爲條件、此其用意、即係說明意國保持國聯會員國資格、純係暫時性質也、又首相在巴萊摩城發表演說時、并謂“阿比西尼亞壽終正寢、其屍骸暴露未葬、正達十六閱月之久、國際空氣業已爲之穢濁不堪、吾人所要求者、乃由國聯會簽發死亡證明書而已、”至“地中海文化、乃係歐亞菲三洲所共同創造、余茲鄭重籲請地中海沿岸各國和平相處、此種呼聲深信必爲各該國所聆取、即使充耳不聞、即吾人亦無所畏懼、則以法西斯主義之意大利、力量偉大、業已有備無患、不論何種命運、均能應付裕如故也”云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>意大利行動引起各國反感</h3>
<p>英法視爲無足驚異　小恊約國深滋疑懼</p>
<p>倫敦</p>
<p>此間報紙今日對於意國退出國聯之說、並不驚異、亦不憂慮、“每日郵報”在社評中稱“遠在意國用兵東菲、國聯實施制裁之時、雙方關係已難再維持、故意國現在退出、意中事也惟國聯因意國退出、將益見其衰頹不振耳”、“每日快報”亦稱、“意國退出、亳無關係、墨索里尼之恐嚇國聯、猶之敎徒恐嚇敎會、實則此等組織、本不能有何成就”云、“新聞記事報”稱、類此之新聞、未必有人能聞而墜淚、因國際關係本尚坦白、墨索里尼至今始能對於國聯作坦白之行動、國聯亦當能因意國之去、而更爲强固更爲純潔矣”云云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>“工黨每日民聲報”載稱、“意首相墨索里尼茲竟與國聯會决別、足見其對於和平正義自由、均不復加以信仰、而惟戰爭暴力與霸權是尚、實則世界各國認識墨索里尼愈深、則其安全程度即可因之而提高”、自由黨孟却斯德保衛報載稱、“意大利內國局勢雖非危急、但醞釀之甚、已足使該國當局尤其是墨索里尼爲之不安、爰乃出以動人表示、而與國聯會相决裂、冀有以减輕人民之怨望”（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於意國决定退出國聯會事、英國負責方面頃加以評論、以爲意德日三國於簽訂反共恊定之後、今又在外交上出於反抗國聯會之舉動、用以表示三國立塲完全一致、并增强各該國“討價還價之力量”、匪特意德兩國關於取消國聯盟約第十至第十六條一項主張、因而愈益有力、即意國關於正式承認該國兼併阿比西尼亞一項要求、亦可爲之加强、此在英國國會左派人士則謂、若干小國對於國聯會之信心、原已不無動搖、意國退盟之後、各該小國所持態度、或當感受影響亦未可必云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎</p>
<p>關於意國决定退出國聯會一事、法國各報頃加以評論、“小巴黎人報”駐羅馬訪員電稱、“此間一般人咸、謂意相墨素里尼殆以爲英國未必在友好精神之下、澈底解决懸案、俾雙方關係得以切實趨於緩和、爰乃出以此舉”日報載稱、“英意兩國互相接近之舉、在墨索里尼視之、已屬無望、爰乃决定變更政策、而與德日兩國團結一致、此在某某人士則謂、意相深恐德國聽從英國之勸吿、而重返國聯會、因而决定退出國聯會、以先發制人、”“愛克西有報”載稱、“意德日三國相率以强硬態度對待國聯會、殆欲於他日重返時、索取巨大之代價、並在中歐洲菲洲亞洲方面獲致更大之利益、特英法美三國在殖民地政治經濟財政各項問題上、恐不能向各該國再事讓步耳、”右派“時代報”戰稱、“自是厥後、世界各國分成兩大集團、其一乃以國際公法爲依歸、其一則惟本身願望是向”、右派“斐伽羅報”載稱，“意與德日兩國組成集團、而欲吸引其他各國以爲衛星、此其所爲、乃將此一集團與彼一集團之門戶予以杜塞、而與國際和平組織和反抗”、“社會黨人民報”載稱“意國此項决定、乃表示不願與英法成立折衷方案、而一意孤行、並不與歐洲相合作”云、（十日哈瓦期電）</p>
<p>小恊約</p>
<p>［維也納］捷克南斯拉夫羅馬尼亞三恊約國與歐洲盼望國聯担保彼等之權利與獨立之較小各國、聞意國决議脫離國聯之消息、皆深滋疑懼、恐意國此舉、或將爲續作一種驚人舉動之先聲、歐洲最近之發展、受威脅最甚者厥爲捷克、故該國疑懼尤甚、南斯拉夫爲國聯有力之贊助者、今方與意國親善、故所處地位亦覺困難、此間消息靈通各界表示意見、謂南國將抱意國之决議與彼無關之觀念、同時意國之擬宣布退出國聯、柏林對之甚感興趣、柏林政界並不爲之驚異、視此舉為意國受國聯待遇後自然之結果、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>意國退盟</h3>
<p>依據盟約規定　兩年後始生效</p>
<p>［日內瓦］於意大利退出國聯會之舉、此間一般人認爲業已確定無疑、兩年來迷離恍惚之局面、將因而宣吿結束、國聯秘書處預料意國政府當於本月十二或十三日依據盟約第一條第三段、提出照會通吿退盟、但按之盟約規定、意國須待兩年之後、始可解除盟約所規定之各項義務、因此該國在今後兩年之中、每年須付國聯會會費約一·八○○·○○○金佛郎、而國聯會所屬意籍職員約二十名、包括副秘書長畢洛蒂·經濟專家史多巴尼在內、均當分別去職、按意國乃國聯會發起國之一、在一九二○年六月十日、卽盟約實施之日、加入國聯爲會員國、迨至一九三六年五月、因阿比西尼亞國問題之故、拒不出席行政院會議、是年九月、國聯大會决定允許阿比西尼亞代表團照常出席之後、意代表卽退出大會、同時拒不派遣代表參加國聯所屬各專門委員會、直至此日爲止、此項態度迄未變更云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］關於日本樞密院議員、石井子爵來英一事、此間外交界人士頃宣稱、石井此行主要目標、乃向英國當局說明該國在中國境內所保有之重要利益、日本當予以尊重、至石井昨日訪晤外相艾登本日訪謁首相張伯倫時、曾否談及中日戰事調處問題、尚不可知、惟據消息靈通人士實稱、英駐日大使克萊琪日昨訪晤日外相廣田時、曾經提及調處問題、並為“純粹參考”起見、詢問日本媾和條伴如何、廣田答以日本不能頂先擬定媾和條件、但中日兩國必須直接談判一層、極願各國加以承認、關於此層、英國一般人以為中日兩國直接談判、卽係日本完全控制中國之謂、若欲英國出而斡旋、促使中國接受直接談判、則英國自當拒不照辦、至英國對於中日爭端所行政策、現以維護本國利益最為注重云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>于斌主敎談中日戰局</h3>
<p>謂南京卽使陷落　我仍必抗戰到底</p>
<p>［巴黎］南京區主敎于斌今日在此間接見新聞記者發表談話、宣稱、中國在蔣介石將軍不斷之努力下、統一方慶完成、建設正在猛進之際、遠東事件爆發、使之中阻、于氏繼稱、共產黨在中國已受斷然失敗、反共運動係自然由人民產生、因共產黨本身、與中國傳統觀念大有枘鐅、而日本侵略中國之眞正原因、亦决非共產黨、“防共”云者、不過掩飾暴行之口實而已、于氏繼謂、中國兵民現均抱定“寗死不屈”之志、于氏本人相信、正義必獲最後勝利、中國前途甚可樂觀、至於南京若竟不守、亦决不表示抗戰之崩潰、因從經濟上、南京固非中心、蔣介石將軍擁有無限制之經費、作長時期之抵抗也、中國人民本酷好和平、但現時全國一心、除抵抗侵略堅持到底外、別無第二思想、于氏繼稱、中國自戰事爆發後、醫藥器材至感缺乏、敎會人士雖熱心救護、但尤有不敷之虞、渠日內將印發專册為之呼籲云、（九日海通電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］于斌主敎頃自羅馬抵此、定於明日就遠東時局公開講演、頃向哈瓦斯社訪員發表談話、說明講演之大意、略謂中國現正遭受侵略、此乃極不公允之事、但吾人未可以責任諉諸日本民族、則以中國非與日本民族而實與日本軍閥作戰故也、夫日軍突然進攻、中國方面或因出於不意、致為所乘、但並未為所擊倒、中國政府自遷都重慶之後、南京城在政治上業已失去重要性、卽使失陷，亦不足為之頹喪、至在軍略上言之、只須展開中國地圖、卽可見中國絕大部份、仍向蔣介石將軍矢忠不貳也、“又謂中國天主敎會現與中國政府通力合作、以促國家之復興、中國社會優秀份子亦多信奉天主敎義、卽蔣介石將軍所撰西安事變記中、亦有一段述及渠信仰基督之忱、辭意偉大、實足令人油然起敬云、（九日哈斯電）</p>

<h3>對日實施經濟制裁</h3>
<p>非美國參加不為功　史太萊敎授之意見</p>
<p>［紐約］此間國聯同志會今日出版史太萊敎授論文小册一種、主張對日實施經濟制裁、據史氏之意、英美荷三國若能共同對日實施經濟制裁、卽足以制日本之死命、史氏研考幾種美國對於此次遠東戰事之政策、認為各國共同對日之經濟制裁、實較美國單獨之宣佈中立為佳、因各國共同對日經濟制裁、在美國所受之損失、較對中日兩國皆不供給軍火之中立政策為遠小也、史氏又謂對日經濟制裁、非美國參加不可、否則不獨無效、抑且是以危及他國之經濟、蓋日本之總輸入中、美國供給百分之三一、同時日本之總輸出中美國接受其百分之二二、故美國參加對日制裁、始能發生充分之效力、反之、在美國方面並不致感受多大之影響、因卽須美國婦女人各犧牲一雙絲襪、卽能辦到也、同時不買日人之生絲、並不致增加美國絲織工業之失業工人、因此等工業中之機器、若代以人造絲與棉紗、並無不妥、月美國絲織工業廣用人造絲與棉紗之後、則人造絲工業與紡紗工業、必將大見活躍、故現有之失業工人不獨不致增加、且將因對日裁裁而益見誠少也、（九日國民電）</p>

<p>災童衣服呼籲捐助</p>
<p>災童冬季衣服、頗感缺乏、現雖由華洋義賬會特撥賑款四千元、指定專製災童衣服、但據團際救濟會估計、尚不敷支配、故切望各界在聖誕節前、盡量捐助災童衣服、或捐款指定購備災童衣服之用、務期達到至聖誕節後、每一災童、均有足以抗禦嚴寒之衣服、</p>
<p>派員慰問擧行集會</p>

<p>二十五萬餘人、雖各界慈善人士、樂捐鉅款、終以嗷嗷待哺者之數量衆多、持久之救濟維艱、每日一角捐運動之意義、在於“一人救一難民、蓋每日每人節省一角、卽可維持一個雜民一日之給養、每月集滿三元、卽可救濟難民一人一月之生活、以上海有三百五十萬人口而論、至少有一百萬人生活、足以自給、目下難民約有二十五萬餘人、兩者比例、成一與四之比平均</p>
<p>每四人中如有一人實行“每日一角捐運動”、卽全部解决二十五萬難民長期給養之問題、本運動雖名為“每日一角捐運動”、惟須積滿一月以三元為一單位、如有力者能多捐幾個單位、則每月卽可多救幾條生命、如捐款者願知難民之一切情形、本會當將芳名</p>
<p>書於布條上、懸掛於被救助之難民胸前、以表示此一難良為某君所救濟、而捐款者並得隨時走詢所救助之難民、令其報吿生活狀况、此舉旣可表彰捐款者之仁風、並可使被救助者發生直接關係、本會為引起捐款者之興趣起見、特製備“一角捐運動紀念章”、每捐一單位者、卽贈送一枚藉彰仁風、而留記念、“一角捐運動”本會信其將來必有良好之效果、蓋每日每人節省一角、數量微細、</p>
<p>輕而易擧滬地不乏樂善之士、希望體念啼飢號寒之難民痛苦、踴躍捐輸、廣為提倡、慨然多捐幾個單位、卽可多救幾條生命、其功德寗有涯涘、所有捐款請逕送八仙橋靑年會三樓本會、並鄭重附帶聲明、本會並不派員向外募捐、以防流弊、如各界各公司各團體自動發起彙集成數後、送交本會、當一一製奉收據為憑、統希公鑒、</p>
<h3>徐家匯將徵收捐稅</h3>

<h3>General Offensive by Japanese Troops on the Capital</h3>
<p>We Have Not Replied to the Japanese Demands; Fierce Resistance by Our Troops in Major Battle in the Suburbs of the Capital; Wuhu Reportedly Fallen, Dangtu in Peril</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Because Tang Shengzhi did not reply to Matsui's demand for peaceful surrender of the city, the Japanese army launched a general offensive around Nanjing at 1:30 PM today. Matsui had given Tang a deadline to reply by noon. (December 10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankou] The war in the Nanjing area has rapidly developed since this morning, turning into the largest and fiercest battle since the start of the Sino-Japanese War. According to news received here, the Chinese army defending Nanjing is determined to hold on to the end and resist to the death. As of this morning, not a single Japanese soldier has entered the city. Although there was fierce fighting all night last night, it was limited to the southwestern suburbs of Nanjing, about twelve miles from the city. Neutral observers are paying close attention to all aspects of the Nanjing battle, believing that the fate of Nanjing is of great importance to China's entire future. (December 10th Kuomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to a telegram from Wuhu received here today, Nanjing and Dangtu near Wuhu were occupied by the Japanese army at 11:00 AM this morning. (December 10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Seven thousand Japanese soldiers, including some cavalry, have advanced to Dasheng Pass, about eight miles upstream from Nanjing, to prevent the Chinese army defending the city from retreating towards Wuhu. (December 10th Kuominshe dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Minister of War reported to the cabinet today on the Nanjing war situation, stating that Nanjing and its surroundings are fortified with solid defensive works, but it is doubtful whether the Chinese army can offer any vigorous resistance. (December 10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The General Headquarters announced today that the commander of the Japanese forces in the Nanjing area is Lieutenant General Asaka no Miya Yasuhiko, a former military councillor and son-in-law of the Meiji Emperor, currently fifty years old. (December 10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Local News) According to inquiries from well-informed Westerners in this port, the fighting in Nanjing from yesterday morning to yesterday afternoon did not ease due to the note from Japanese Commander Matsui Iwane to General Tang Shengzhi, requesting peaceful entry into the city. On the contrary, the fighting around Guanghua Gate, Tongji Gate, and Zhongshan Gate became even more intense. From morning to noon, there was no moment of respite. The Chinese army was extremely determined to defend Nanjing to the death, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese army. In the afternoon, when the Japanese army's demand for peaceful entry into the city was hopeless, it launched a general offensive, unfolding an even more intense and bloody battle. The Japanese army had apparently received reinforcements and supplies, mobilizing heavy artillery and tanks, and concentrating all its efforts and firepower on the southeastern Nanjing city walls, launching a massive bombardment and using large formations of aircraft to bomb the city walls, attempting to break through the city walls and enter. The Chinese army held fast along the city, using machine guns and mortars to bombard the Japanese soldiers approaching the base of the city walls, and also using heavy artillery to bombard the Japanese positions. The density of the fire from both sides was such that there was hardly a minute's pause. The locations where the fighting occurred were: ❶ Xiaolingwei, between Tangshan and Zhongshan Gate, where the struggle between the two sides was extremely fierce the night before. It is said that the Japanese army had approached Zhongshan Gate yesterday. ❷ Dajiaochang: the Japanese army divided its forces into two routes, attacking Tongji and Guanghua Gates yesterday morning. Several sections of the city wall were destroyed but were blocked and repelled by the Chinese army. ❸ Yuhuatai is still in the hands of the Chinese army. The Japanese army was blocked north of the fork in the road, and its attack on Yuhuatai was unsuccessful. However, Xishanqiao (a small station on the Jiangnan Railway), southwest of Yuhuatai, has been occupied by the Japanese army. ❹ Zijin Mountain: the Japanese army advanced towards Wulong Temple and Jiangwang Temple, attempting to attack Taiping Gate. The war is not far from Taiping Gate.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attacks Two City Gates Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Yesterday, two thousand Japanese soldiers, carrying thirty tanks, launched a surprise attack on two gates of Nanjing. After the Japanese army occupied Dajiaochang Flying Field and the Air Defense School, they used them as bases for attacking Guanghua Gate and Tongji Gate. The Chinese army defending the gates used mortars, machine guns, and rifles to resist. General Tang Shengzhi urgently dispatched the Model Division to reinforce the defenses of Guanghua Gate. According to Chinese sources, after fierce fighting at the two gates, the Japanese army was pursued and driven away, suffering heavy casualties. The city gate of Guanghua Gate was pierced by artillery shells. Yesterday's Japanese surprise attack was stronger and more powerful, it had entered the city and captured Nanjing. The reason why the Japanese army was able to launch a surprise attack was that the Chinese army originally defending the gates attempted to withdraw from the positions at the city gates. The Chinese army was affected by the heavy bombing by Japanese aircraft, and its morale was affected, allowing the Japanese army to advance with almost no resistance. The sound of explosions was very loud last night, proving that the Chinese army was engaged in blowing up bridges and other important military locations. This morning, two Japanese balloons rose over Zijin Mountain to the south for reconnaissance. The Chinese army fired at them but missed. (December 10th, 10:00 AM Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Reportedly Occupy Wuhu</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] According to reports received here, the Japanese army occupied Wuhu yesterday and advanced eastward from Wuhu this morning, occupying Dangtu. It is said that Tang Shengzhi, the Nanjing Garrison Commander, has ordered the construction of defensive works inside the city of Nanjing and advised all foreigners, including representatives of the diplomatic corps, to leave the capital. (December 10th Kuomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Local News) In order to attack the rear of Nanjing, the Japanese army advanced on the Jiangnan Railway from Guangde and Lishui in two routes. After Ningguo was captured by the Japanese army on the 8th, they advanced north towards Wuhu. It is said that the Japanese army crossed the Qingshui River south of Wuhu yesterday and divided their forces into two routes to attack Yangcun, the southern suburb of Wuhu, and Qiaocun, the southwestern suburb of Wuhu. The Japanese side claims to have captured Wuhu this morning, but this has not been confirmed by other sources. As for the Japanese army in the Lishui area, they are advancing towards Dangtu, seemingly trying to threaten the right flank of Nanjing and the left flank of Wuhu. The current situation in Wuhu is indeed very critical.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Blockade Line Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Hankou] According to inquiries here, after a week of struggle, the Japanese army destroyed one of the water barriers set up by the Chinese army in the Yangtze River near Jiangyin yesterday. Several destroyers have set off for Nanjing, but there is a second water barrier in Zhenjiang, and the Chinese army's land-based artillery is constantly bombarding them. The Japanese navy attacking Nanjing is quite threatened. (December 10th Kuomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Local News) After the fall of Jiangyin, because our blockade lines were dense and difficult to clear at once, the Japanese warships could not easily advance westward along the Yangtze River, which greatly weakened the Japanese army's combat capabilities. For the sake of continuing the resistance war, our army is constructing a stronger blockade line near a certain place in Jiujiang. At present, Japanese warships are still unable to coordinate with their land forces. Although the Jiangyin blockade line may be removed in the short term, there is still the blockade line in Zhenjiang blocking their westward advance.</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM yesterday, it was confirmed that the Japanese army had landed in Jingjiang. A total of ten Japanese destroyers and small gunboats had sailed up the Yangtze River towards Jiangyin. All the sunken ships blocking Jiangyin have not yet been removed. According to the crew of the British ship Wuhu, which arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday, loud artillery fire was still heard in the Jingjiang area on the evening of the 8th.</p>
<h3>One Japanese Plane Shot Down in Nanchang</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Nanchang, December 10th dispatch: When Japanese aircraft attacked Nanchang at noon on the 9th, our air force immediately took off and encountered the Japanese aircraft in the suburbs, launching a fierce battle. Our army had an absolute advantage and shot down a Japanese aircraft in Dashan Yangcun, more than twenty miles northeast of the city. The military authorities heard the report on the morning of the 10th and sent personnel to inspect. According to local villagers, when the Japanese aircraft crashed, the pilot descended with a parachute, hoping to escape, but he was shot in the head and died instantly upon landing. The fuselage was also destroyed. It was identified as a Mitsubishi Type 31, a single-seat Type 94 carrier-based bomber manufactured in the eleventh year of Taisho (1922). There was also an engine and two machine guns. The wreckage will be transported to the provincial capital for public exhibition. (December 10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Defend Nanjing and Resist to the End</h3>
<p>[London] The Chinese Ambassador in London received a telegram today stating that rumors of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's imminent resignation are completely unfounded. The Chinese army is currently resolutely defending around Nanjing and has completed various preparations for street fighting in case of war inside the city. The telegram also stated that Chinese guerrilla forces have recovered many cities in eastern Shandong. (December 10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankou] According to Chinese authoritative sources here, the Chinese army defending Nanjing will hold on to the end as long as there is a single soldier. China's advantageous strategy is to prolong the war as much as possible to wait for Japan to be exhausted. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in a conversation with a Kuomin News Agency reporter this afternoon that even if Nanjing falls, the Chinese army will clearly demonstrate its spirit of continuing the resistance war in future battles. Under no circumstances will it retreat without a fight. The spokesman continued, saying that if Nanjing really falls, the Chinese people will not be disappointed, because the superiority of Japanese weaponry is known to the world, and China's resistance war can only seek ultimate victory through maximum sacrifice. What the Chinese government and people are jointly satisfied with is that they have a capable leader, General Chiang Kai-shek, who enjoys the unanimous support and trust of the entire nation. As long as Chiang believes that the resistance war should continue, the entire country will be united against the enemy. (December 9th Kuomin News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Customs Issue</h3>
<p>The Japanese Government is Still Not Satisfied and Continues Negotiations in Tokyo</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with newspaper reporters today, he acknowledged that some Japanese have recently been added to the Chinese customs in Shanghai, but said that the Japanese government is not satisfied with the Shanghai customs situation and negotiations are still underway. (December 10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Paris] A message has been sent from certain sources, stating that Japan is about to try to manipulate Chinese customs administration. Well-informed people here have explained the nature and scope of the relationship between France and Chinese customs. First, they described the operation of the Chinese customs administration, and then said that the Chinese customs currently has eight French customs officers, whose income is used as collateral for foreign debt guarantees, with the principal and interest being paid. France's main interest lies in this. As for the Boxer Indemnity, the interest is paid from customs revenue, and the French part was returned to China from 1925 and used to carry out cultural and other undertakings with the consent of the Chinese government for many years. Therefore, if the Chinese customs administration and tax revenue are controlled by Japan, these undertakings and the benefits enjoyed by France will naturally be affected.

<h3>Chinese Leaders Discuss Reasons for the Failure of the Resistance War</h3>
<p>The Failure in North China Was Due More to Politics; The Issue of Reinforcements is Currently Very Serious</p>
<p>[Hankou] A Reuters correspondent interviewed Chinese leaders here to inquire about their opinions. They all spoke very frankly about the reasons for the failure of the Chinese resistance war, saying that although the failures in North China and along the Shanghai-Nanjing Line were considered inevitable, they occurred earlier than any government official had predicted. The main reason for the failure in North China was more due to politics than military matters. The central government never had high hopes for the armies of Song, Yan, and Han. These old-fashioned military leaders all played a "hedging" game. They expressed loyalty to the central government and a willingness to resist Japan, while at the same time courting the Japanese side. At the beginning of the military campaign, they were all trapped in a hopeless position, lacking organization and preparation, resulting in Song Zheyuan being driven out of Hebei Province, Liu Ruming being driven out of Chahar Province, and Yan Xishan now losing his territory in Shanxi Province. Han Fuqu's inability to defend Shandong Province can be foreseen. Another reason for the military failure in North China was that most of the officers above the rank of battalion commander were not up to the task of command, with the exception of a very few. They had not received training in modern warfare and most of them were wealthy and unwilling to die on the battlefield. All the major battles in North China were fought by the central army. Nankou was defended by the armies of Tang Enbo and Wei Lihuang, and Xinkou was fought by the armies of Hao Mengling and Xu Yuanquan. The old Northeast Army was probably the worst of the Chinese armies. When they launched the Xi'an Incident last December, they loudly chanted the slogan "Fight Back to Our Old Home," but unexpectedly, the real war was at hand. Not only were they unable to fulfill their responsibilities in the war, but they also dragged down other armies. Wan Fulin's army mutinied in Gu'an, allowing the Japanese army to flank the defending army in Baoding. Liu Duoquan's army (Zhang Xueliang's elite troops) mutinied in Dezhou, forcing the defending army in Cangzhou to retreat. Liu's army later mutinied in Suzhou, causing the defense line between Nanjing and Shanghai to be breached, which is very regrettable. The leader also said that the elite troops of the Chinese army suffered extremely heavy losses this time, especially on the Shanghai front. Because they did not have sufficient artillery support to cover them and almost no air defense equipment, they remained on the battlefield for several months, and as a result, most of them were completely wiped out. In terms of medical equipment, it was too simple, resulting in many of the wounded dying from delayed treatment, which greatly depleted manpower and greatly affected morale. Now, visiting various hospitals here, most of the wounded soldiers are those who have been hit by bombs and artillery shells, and the number of those with bullet wounds is very small. These elite troops remained on the battlefield until they were destroyed by the Japanese army's artillery and aircraft, which is very painful. The issue of reinforcements is now very serious. It is important to know that good soldiers cannot be trained overnight, and officers are even more difficult to obtain. Now the government's hope is placed on Guangxi Province, which has so far sent twelve divisions of troops, because Bai Chongxi implemented a military training system in the province early on, so continuing to mobilize reinforcements is not difficult. Liu Xiang, the chairman of Sichuan, is responsible for maintaining twelve divisions on the battlefield, and Zhang Zhizhong is also training new troops in Hunan Province.

<h3>People's Hearts in Qingdao Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>[Qingdao] A week ago, the hearts of the people in Qingdao were quite panic-stricken, but now they are gradually stabilizing. Mayor Shen Honglie and the military authorities have declared that if the Japanese army attacks Qingdao, they are determined to fight to the death. Shen said to a Reuters correspondent: "We are determined to defend Qingdao to the last breath." He also said that if the Japanese army tries to attack Qingdao, it will cost them a huge price. The Japanese army is currently engaged in encirclement operations, so the overall situation in this port is becoming increasingly serious. Chinese banks are still open and operating as usual. Commerce and shipping are also as usual. Senior officials are all staying in their posts, and many junior officials have left due to staff reductions. (December 10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Bomber Plummets and Explodes</h3>

The other two aircraft circled several times and then flew west. (December 10th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Tries to Open Shanghai-Suzhou Train</h3>
<p>According to Japanese sources, after the Shanghai-Suzhou railway section was reorganized by the Japanese army's Sato Railway Unit, a train was opened at the North Station on the morning of the 8th. The train had twenty-two carriages. In addition to being fully loaded with Japanese military supplies and food, it also carried seven members of the Japanese House of Representatives and three members of the Social People's Party. There were many Japanese army guards in the car, and the car windows were tightly closed. The repair work after the Qinyanggang railway bridge was blown up was quite difficult. Thanks to the efforts of 200 soldiers from the railway unit, the bridge was opened on the morning of the 7th. Because most of the freight cars from before the war were destroyed and unusable, a batch has been shipped from Japan. Corpses were piled up in the rice fields along the way. The train left the North Station at 8:00 AM and did not arrive in Suzhou until 2:20 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Invasion of Guangdong Extremely Likely</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] An attempt for the Japanese to invade Guangdong is considered extremely likely here. According to telegrams received this morning, the Guangdong Provincial Government offices have prepared to move from Guangzhou to northern cities. It is believed that Japan will advance from Taiwan, first seizing Shantou. After the capture of Nanjing, they will not only concentrate on North China, but will also attempt to capture South China, seeking to occupy the important port of Guangzhou. It is estimated that the Japanese invasion force in Guangdong will be around 100,000. It is believed that Yu Hanmou, the Guangdong Pacification Director, has deployed a very thorough defense, sufficient to protect Guangdong Province. At the same time, the waterways from Guangzhou to the interior have been closed and a large number of troops have been concentrated in the provincial capital.

<h3>Japanese Five-Minister Conference Decides on New Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>Decided to Expand the War and Push Through to the End; Refuse Mediation by Third Countries; We Have the Determination to Continue the Resistance War</p>
<p>[Tokyo] ❶ Not recognizing the government of General Chiang Kai-shek; ❷ Carrying out an expanded war; ❸ Assisting in the construction of a new China. According to semi-official sources, the opinions of the cabinet members are roughly as follows: ❶ The current situation was caused by General Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to achieve China's unification through an anti-Japanese policy, so it is very difficult for Japan to negotiate with General Chiang Kai-shek to restore peace. ❷ The Chinese authorities' advocacy of peace is due to their difficult situation and is clearly lacking in sincerity. They have not awakened to the happiness and pacifism of the East, and are only trying to escape their current predicament. ❸ If the government of General Chiang Kai-shek becomes a local government due to the fall of Nanjing, then Japan will of course assist the new movements in North China and Central China to facilitate the creation of a revitalized new China.

<p>[Hankou] Hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute have quickly vanished here. Chinese government leaders seem to believe that Japan does not need to accept Germany's mediation in this war. Germany has expressed its willingness to be a neutral mediator, but has not yet made a formal offer to conduct Sino-Japanese peace negotiations. German Ambassador Trautmann recently entered Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and only inquired to the Chinese side whether peace negotiations could be started. Although Nanjing discussed the whole issue, no concrete or specific conditions were agreed upon. After Ambassador Trautmann returned here from Nanjing, he no longer intends to continue the talks in Nanjing. According to news here, the whole issue has now been put on hold, pending Japan's willingness to accept mediation, and careful attention is being paid to the statements issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. Chinese officials believe that Japan is determined to occupy Nanjing and then set up an administrative agency there for a considerable period of time, and that Japan will firmly insist on direct negotiations with China, and that its peace terms will eventually be sent directly to the Chinese government without going through German mediators. However, China will never accept this procedure. When Ambassador Trautmann entered Nanjing, people here all thought that peace was very hopeful. All walks of life in China believed that Germany, which had friendly relations with both China and Japan, would guarantee to put forward peace terms acceptable to both sides. However, the Japanese army's active attack on Nanjing and the recent statements issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo have completely changed the atmosphere here. Chinese government leaders believe that China now has no choice but to continue the resistance war. (December 10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany Does Not Align with Japan and Maintains Friendship with China</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the rumor spread by the Japanese side that the Japanese government intends to revoke its recognition of the National Government after the Japanese army captures Nanjing, German semi-official sources recently declared that although Germany and Japan have signed an anti-communist agreement, Germany should still maintain its current relationship with the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek. Chinese people here believe that even if the rumor spread by the Japanese side becomes a reality, it is of no importance, because the Sino-Japanese war is still going on and General Chiang Kai-shek has already decided to resist to the last soldier and bullet. Therefore, even if Japan revokes its recognition of the National Government, it is not worth mentioning. (December 10th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Chargé d'Affaires Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Embassy is located at No. 27 on the Bund. No Danger Encountered from Hankou to Kowloon</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that the British Embassy in China, which had previously moved from Nanjing to Hankou, has now moved from Hankou to Shanghai. The British Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Howe, and a large number of embassy staff arrived in Hong Kong on a special train on the morning of December 5th. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday (9th) on the Blue Funnel Line steamer "Patterson". The American Consul General, Mr. Phillips, and the British Judge, Mr. and Mrs. Mossop, greeted them at the customs wharf yesterday afternoon. The "North-China Daily News" learned that the British Embassy's establishment in Shanghai will be indefinite, and it plans to work at the embassy office at No. 27 on the Bund. During the journey from Hankou to Kowloon, although Japanese aircraft bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, none of the people personally witnessed the bombing. Only railway personnel reported that Japanese aircraft bombed the railway tracks ahead, but did not hit them. In one section of the journey, two Japanese aircraft were seen flying over the train, but they did not drop bombs and flew away. The special train had five carriages, with large British national emblems painted on the roofs. The route was notified to the Japanese authorities in advance, and a guarantee was received the evening before that there would be no attacks. The team saw that both sides of the railway line were heavily damaged. The embassy staff are currently staying at the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Questions Far East Incident</h3>
<p>[London] During a meeting of the British House of Commons today, Labour MP Mr. Fletcher raised questions about the bombing of the British ships "Tehwo" and "Tatung" by Japanese aircraft in Wuhu last week. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, replied in writing that the unexpected incident had been protested immediately to the Japanese Naval Commander by Vice-Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, and an apology was received. At the same time, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, had also protested to the Japanese government. Lord Cranborne also replied to a question about the attack on the Taikoo steamship "Hsiushan" near Chongming Island, stating that according to information he had received, it appeared that Chinese troops had fired on the ship. If the investigation by the British Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Phillips, proves this to be true, a protest will be lodged with the Chinese government. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Investigation into the Number of Japanese Ships</h3>
<p>The Japanese army stationed along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway and the area along Taihu Lake, up to the border of Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, has recently continued to dispatch troops to Shanghai, to be transferred to various front lines. The total number has exceeded 250,000. The transport ships used range from a minimum of 4,000 tons to a maximum of 11,000 tons. As of yesterday, more than 400 ships have been dispatched, shuttling between Japan, Shanghai, and Dalian, specifically for transporting troops and loading military supplies and provisions. Currently, transportation is more common in Shanghai and the Yangtze River area, while large warships have been redeployed to various locations in South China. A detailed and accurate investigation into the Japanese warships and transport ships stationed in Shanghai, Wusong, and the Yangtze River yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>In the Yangtze River, off the coast of Fukuyama, i.e., outside of Hupu, there is (1) the aircraft carrier "Kamikawa Maru", carrying more than 40 seaplanes, (2) a destroyer from the 24th squadron, (3) transport ship No. 45, (4) transport ship No. 352.

At the No. 43 river pier is the "Kanto Maru" No. 173, at the No. 43 river pier is the "Koa Maru" No. 388, at the No. 40 river pier are the "Jumatsu Maru" No. 180 and the "Taizan Maru" No. 371. In front of the China Merchants Wharf is the "Chiyo Maru", and another ship without a name. At the Pudong NYK wharf are the "Kongo Maru", the "Sanwei Maru", and No. 385, the "Kiko Maru". At the Huangpu wharf are No. 361, the "Daini Toshima Maru", and the "Daini Shonan Maru". At the Osaka wharf are No. 106, the "Kensho Maru", and No. 57, the "Confucius Maru".

At the China Merchants Bureau's central wharf is the transport ship "Asami Maru", at the No. 1 river pier is destroyer No. 1, and in front of the Japanese Consulate is the "Izumo" battleship. In total, there were 80 Japanese warships and transport ships and more than 20 steamships in Shanghai, Wusong, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River yesterday. At 3:30 PM yesterday, the transport ship "Koto Maru" returned to Japan from Shanghai, carrying more than 400 naval landing force personnel from Shanghai.</p>
<p>For days, Japanese wounded soldiers and corpses have been continuously transported from the front lines by both water and land. There were three batches transported for export yesterday. The first batch, carried by the "Hokushin Maru" Red Cross ship, which was berthed at the China Merchants Bureau's north wharf, loaded more than 2,000 wounded soldiers and 1,000 corpses, and departed at 7:00 AM. The second batch of more than 3,000 wounded soldiers and more than 1,000 corpses was carried by the "Kyowa Maru" Red Cross ship, which was berthed at the China Merchants Bureau's central wharf, and departed at 11:00 AM. The third batch of more than 1,000 wounded soldiers, in addition to 10,000 bags of mung bean skins, boarded the "Chikugo Maru" transport ship and departed at 1:30 PM. Also, 700 naval landing force personnel boarded the "Koto Maru" transport ship, which was berthed at the Mitsubishi wharf, and departed at 2:00 PM, destination unknown. The "Nagasaki Maru" postal ship, which arrived in Shanghai the day before, also raised anchor at 12:30 PM yesterday and headed for Japan, carrying more than 400 Japanese men, women, and children.</p>
<h3>Temples in the Nanshi Area Burned Down, Monks Have Nowhere to Hide</h3>
<p>Fleeing into the Refugee Zone, Relief Provided by International Organizations</p>
<p>The Guandi Temple, Jieyin Nunnery, Sanmei Nunnery, Dafo Nunnery, and Zizhu Nunnery in the Nanshi area have been burned down one after another. The monks who remained had nowhere to hide, and their sustenance became difficult. They have all fled outwards. Currently, more than 100 people have fled into the Qingdao Chan Monastery in the refugee zone to stay temporarily, and have appealed to international relief organizations for assistance. The organizations immediately sent staff to distribute food to provide relief.</p>
<h3>The Ciliang Association Adds More Shelters</h3>
<p>Lianshe and Mingde Need Winter Supplies</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Charity Organizations Disaster Relief Association began sheltering refugees, in addition to those who have been sent back or have voluntarily returned to their hometowns, there are still 50,000 to 60,000 people being sheltered, and the shelters, which number more than 50, are full. A large number of people are still waiting to be rescued, so two more shelters, Lianshe and Mingde, have been added to accommodate them. However, donations are currently less than before, and the burden of sustenance is even heavier. The refugees lack bedding, cotton clothing, and trousers, and the cold weather means that there is a risk of freezing to death. It is heard that many refugees in the shelters are sick due to the cold. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will take pity on the displaced people and donate their frugal savings to the refugees to purchase winter supplies, which would be an immeasurable act of merit.</p>

<h3>Italy Decides to Withdraw from the League of Nations, Brewing a New International Group</h3>
<p>The Anti-Comintern Pact Between Germany, Italy, and Japan is the Backbone. The Italian Supreme Administrative Council Meets Today.</p>
<p>[Rome] Since the news broke that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will announce Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations on the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia on Saturday, Rome has been filled with a tense and expectant atmosphere. The news has spread throughout the country in an instant. It is said that after Italy withdraws from the League of Nations, it will become closer to Japan and Germany. Mussolini's idea is to form a new group of nations with the Anti-Comintern Pact as its core. Most Italians expect that the visit of Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović to Rome will create a new order in the Danube River area. However, Reuters has learned from responsible sources that the Yugoslav Prime Minister did not mention Yugoslavia joining the Anti-Comintern Pact during his visit to Rome. It is heard that the declaration of Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations will be announced at approximately 10:00 PM on Saturday after the meeting of the Fascist Supreme Administrative Council. The meeting will only last a few minutes, simply to listen to Mussolini's proposal and express approval. At that time, a large number of people will likely be waiting for Mussolini to announce it. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The local newspapers today all claim that after Italy withdraws from the League of Nations, it will in effect establish a "Fascist Alliance" with the Anti-Comintern Pact as its backbone and Berlin as its headquarters. The famous reporter Madame Tabouis said that the news has shocked the delegations of Fascist countries in Geneva. It is expected that Switzerland will request the League of Nations to relocate to a new location. (Guomin News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding Italy's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations, Prime Minister Mussolini will solemnly announce it at tomorrow's meeting of the Fascist Party's Supreme Council. This move is a natural result of the Prime Minister's speeches in Milan and Palermo on November 1st last year and August 20th this year. At that time, the Prime Minister repeatedly stated that Italian policy was to establish an understanding with Britain and France, but on the condition that the League of Nations Covenant be either amended or put aside. The intention was to explain that Italy's maintaining its membership in the League of Nations was purely temporary. Furthermore, when the Prime Minister delivered a speech in Palermo, he said, "Abyssinia has passed away, and its corpse has been exposed and unburied for sixteen months. The international atmosphere has become extremely foul. What we ask is simply that the League of Nations issue a death certificate." As for "Mediterranean culture, it was jointly created by the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. I hereby solemnly call on the countries along the Mediterranean to live together in peace. I believe that this call will be heeded by all those countries, and even if they turn a deaf ear, we will not be afraid, because Fascist Italy is powerful and has already prepared for any eventuality, so that it can cope with any kind of fate." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding Italy's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations, it is rumored in the House of Representatives lounge that other countries will follow Italy's example and withdraw from the League of Nations, but it was not specified which countries. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>[Paris] According to semi-official sources here today, if Italian Prime Minister Mussolini can abandon his decision to withdraw from the League of Nations, then Britain and France might recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. (Guomin News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Actions Arouse Displeasure in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Britain and France See It as Unsurprising, the Little Entente Countries Are Deeply Suspicious</p>
<p>London</p>
<p>The local newspapers today are neither surprised nor worried about Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations. The "Daily Mail" said in an editorial, "The relationship between the two sides had already become difficult to maintain when Italy used troops in East Africa and the League of Nations imposed sanctions. It is natural for Italy to withdraw now, but the League of Nations will become more decadent as a result of Italy's withdrawal." The "Daily Express" also said, "Italy's withdrawal is of no consequence. Mussolini's threatening the League of Nations is like a parishioner threatening the church. In fact, organizations of this kind cannot achieve anything." The "News Chronicle" said, "Perhaps no one will shed tears upon hearing such news, because international relations are inherently straightforward. Mussolini has only now been able to take a straightforward action towards the League of Nations, and the League of Nations should be able to become stronger and purer as a result of Italy's departure." (Guomin News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>The "Labour Daily Herald" stated, "Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has finally broken with the League of Nations, showing that he no longer has faith in peace, justice, and freedom, but only in war, violence, and hegemony. In fact, the more the countries of the world understand Mussolini, the more their security can be improved." The Liberal Party's "Manchester Guardian" stated, "Although the internal situation in Italy is not critical, the brewing discontent is enough to make the country's authorities, especially Mussolini, uneasy. Therefore, they made a moving gesture and broke with the League of Nations, hoping to alleviate the people's resentment." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding Italy's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations, responsible British sources recently commented that after Italy, Germany, and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, they are now taking actions in foreign affairs that defy the League of Nations to show that the three countries' positions are completely consistent and to increase each country's "bargaining power." Not only are Italy and Germany's claims to abolish Articles 10 to 16 of the League of Nations Covenant becoming more powerful, but Italy's request for formal recognition of its annexation of Abyssinia can also be strengthened. Those on the left in the British Parliament said that the confidence of some small countries in the League of Nations has already been shaken to some extent, and that the attitudes of these small countries may be affected by Italy's withdrawal. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>Regarding Italy's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations, the French newspapers recently commented. The "Petit Parisien" correspondent in Rome reported, "The general opinion here is that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini believes that Britain may not be able to thoroughly resolve the outstanding issues in a friendly spirit, so that relations between the two sides can be effectively eased, and therefore he has taken this action." "Le Journal" said, "Mussolini sees that rapprochement between Britain and Italy is hopeless, so he has decided to change his policy and unite with Germany and Japan." "Some people say that the Italian Prime Minister is deeply afraid that Germany will listen to Britain's advice and return to the League of Nations, so he decided to withdraw from the League of Nations to preemptively strike." "L'Écho de Paris" said, "Italy, Germany, and Japan are adopting a tough attitude towards the League of Nations, intending to demand a huge price when they return in the future and to obtain greater benefits in Central Europe, Africa, and Asia. However, Britain, France, and the United States may not be able to make any more concessions to those countries on colonial, political, economic, and financial issues." The right-wing "Le Temps" stated, "From then on, the countries of the world will be divided into two major groups, one that relies on international law and the other that only follows its own wishes." The right-wing "Le Figaro" stated, "Italy and Germany and Japan have formed a group and want to attract other countries as satellites. What they are doing is blocking the doors between this group and that group, and confronting the international peace organization." The Socialist "Le Populaire" stated, "Italy's decision shows that it is unwilling to reach a compromise with Britain and France, but is determined to go its own way and not cooperate with Europe."

<p>The Little Entente</p>
<p>[Vienna] The three Entente countries of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, and the smaller countries in Europe that hope the League of Nations will guarantee their rights and independence, are deeply suspicious upon hearing the news of Italy's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations, fearing that Italy's action may be a prelude to a series of startling moves. The country most threatened by the recent developments in Europe is Czechoslovakia, so its suspicion is especially strong. Yugoslavia is a strong supporter of the League of Nations, and is now friendly with Italy, so its position is also difficult. Informed sources here expressed the opinion that Yugoslavia will take the view that Italy's decision has nothing to do with it. At the same time, Berlin is very interested in Italy's proposed withdrawal from the League of Nations. The Berlin political circles are not surprised by it, seeing it as a natural result of Italy's treatment by the League of Nations. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Withdrawal from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Effective Two Years Later According to the Provisions of the Covenant</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the general opinion here is that it is now undoubtedly confirmed, and the ambiguous situation of the past two years will thus come to an end. The League of Nations Secretariat expects the Italian government to submit a note on the 12th or 13th of this month, according to paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the Covenant, notifying its withdrawal. However, according to the provisions of the Covenant, Italy must wait two years before it can be relieved of the various obligations stipulated by the Covenant. Therefore, the country must pay the League of Nations an annual membership fee of approximately 1,800,000 gold francs for the next two years, and approximately 20 Italian staff members of the League of Nations, including Deputy Secretary-General Pilotti and economic expert Stoppani, will all leave their posts. Italy was one of the founding members of the League of Nations, joining the League as a member state on June 10, 1920, the date the Covenant came into effect. In May 1936, due to the Abyssinian issue, it refused to attend the meeting of the Administrative Council. In September of that year, after the League of Nations General Assembly decided to allow the Abyssinian delegation to attend as usual, the Italian representative withdrew from the General Assembly and refused to send representatives to participate in the various specialized committees of the League of Nations. This attitude has not changed to this day. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>The United States Reorganizes Its Diplomatic Lineup</h3>
<p>Major Changes to the Ambassadors to Britain, Russia, and Germany</p>
<p>[Washington] It was learned today that Kennedy, the Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission, may be appointed as the Ambassador to Britain, to succeed the current Ambassador Bingham. This appointment will likely be made within two weeks. Although neither the White House nor the State Department have made any statements, it seems that there will be major changes in U.S. diplomatic personnel recently. It was previously reported that the Under Secretary of State will succeed Dodd as the Ambassador to Germany, and diplomatic circles also expect changes for the Ambassador to Russia, Davis, who has already returned home.

<h3>Soviet Parliamentary Elections to Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Molotov Delivers Campaign Speech, Confident That the Red Army Has More Than Enough Strength to Destroy the Enemy</p>
<p>[Moscow] As the date of the first Soviet parliamentary elections approaches, the excitement of the nation is gradually increasing. Voting will be held on Sunday, and all procedures have been completed. It was initially thought that the elections would cause infighting between the parties, but since it was announced that each district would only have one candidate, this has not happened. All male and female citizens of the country, except for those who have been deprived of their civil rights by the courts, will likely vote. There are a total of 1,143 seats up for election. People's Commissar Chairman Molotov attended and spoke at an election meeting held here yesterday. The masses cheered loudly for Soviet dictator Stalin. Molotov explained the work of the new election system, saying that only 2 million communists belonged to the Soviet Party, and there were another 500,000 sympathizers. More than 90 million non-Communist voters will go to the polls, but the Communist Party's campaign banner is asking for help from non-Party workers, professionals, and intellectuals to create a Communist Party election group that is universally supported. The newly established Soviet parliament will have two houses. According to the recently announced Soviet constitution, the lower house is called the "Council of the Union," and one member will be elected by 300,000 voters, using direct secret ballot. The upper house is called the "Council of Nationalities," and representatives of the Soviet and various autonomous national republics and regions will be elected indirectly. The above two organizations will meet twice a year in Moscow, and will form a "Supreme Council" to elect one person as the President of the entire Soviet Union to replace the existing "Presidium." According to the civil rights conferred by the new Soviet constitution, men and women have equal wages, pensions, and holidays. Other rights, such as freedom of religion, political assembly, freedom of speech and the press, and protection against arbitrary arrest, are also stipulated. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet People's Commissar Chairman Molotov said in an election campaign speech today that the Soviet Union has not been involved in war for more than 16 years, but is now prepared to deal with any attacker. The Soviet Union will completely defeat all its enemies, but the main enemies outside the Soviet borders are now lurking in the camps of militarist imperialism, especially in the fascist countries. The Soviet Union is sparing no effort to consolidate its national defense. We are now strengthening the Red Army and the defense industry. We want every factory and every collective farm to be a fortress defending the country's economy and culture. Molotov also criticized the Anti-Comintern Pact and declared that if the Soviet Union were subjected to armed attack, the attackers would feel the iron force of our self-defense and the light of the Soviet Red Star shining beyond the borders. Molotov also said at a meeting of the Central Committee of the All-Union Trade Unions that the Soviet Union would show no mercy and destroy the enemies. If the enemy and the fascist groups try to attack our country, we have the power to destroy them. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>Adhering to the Principles of Collective Security; Close Economic and Cultural Cooperation; Mr. Titulescu to Depart for Nanjing Today</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest, Romania.

He is expected to arrive there on Sunday morning, before transferring to the Czech capital on Tuesday. (Haishang Telegraph, 10th)</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest. The political discussions between French Foreign Minister Titulescu and the Romanian authorities concluded last night. According to well-informed sources, no agreements were signed between the two countries. However, Mr. Titulescu insisted on reaching an understanding as soon as possible with the countries of the Danube River basin, which is particularly beneficial to the Little Entente countries and Hungary. According to unconfirmed reports, Romania has accepted another French arms loan. (Haishang Telegraph, 10th)</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest, Romania.  After discussions between French Foreign Minister Titulescu and Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu this afternoon, a communiqué was issued stating: "The two governments are pleased to declare that their opinions are absolutely identical. The policy of friendship and solidarity pursued by both France and Romania shares the same ideals and is further strengthened by the interlocking alliances and friendly relations that both countries have established with other nations. Furthermore, both countries adhere to the principles of the League of Nations and advocate creating sincere cooperation among nations based on national independence, which is the best way to preserve peace. The two foreign ministers also expressed their determination to further develop cooperation between France and Romania in economic, cultural, and artistic relations and to maintain closer contact in a spirit of unity to enhance peace. At the next meeting of the League of Nations Council, France and Romania's policies will be aligned. Furthermore, the entire international situation, especially the Central European issue and various issues of particular concern to France and Romania, were discussed during the meeting." (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest. The discussions between French Foreign Minister Titulescu and Romanian Prime Minister Tatarescu yesterday mainly focused on economic issues. Romania is currently striving to develop its industry and promote the use of raw materials, which can only be achieved with the assistance of foreign countries, especially France. In addition, Prime Minister Tatarescu is scheduled to visit Paris next January to reciprocate the visit. At that time, he will discuss trade development issues with the French authorities. In this regard, the current commercial agreement between the two countries was established before the devaluation of the French currency and should be revised to adapt to the current French monetary system. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest. It is reported that the Romanian authorities did not make any demands for colonies to the French Foreign Minister, only expressing that Romania's population is increasing rapidly and that they hope to share the convenience of emigration overseas with other countries. The Romanian government will treat all Romanians who voluntarily emigrate abroad equally, regardless of their ethnicity or religious beliefs, and provide them with assistance so that they can make a living abroad. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest. Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu recently hosted a luncheon for French Foreign Minister Titulescu, during which he delivered a speech stating that the foreign policies of France and Romania are completely consistent and highly praised the history of the French nation. He said that Romanian youth often regard French history as a model. "France has greatly contributed to the rise of the principle of national self-determination in Europe." Speaking of the cooperative relationship between Britain and France, he said that its nature is extremely important. "The long-term efforts of the two major democratic countries will definitely be of great benefit to the promotion of human welfare." Regarding the League of Nations issue, both France and Romania advocate close cooperation with the League of Nations, and therefore the power of the League of Nations must be strengthened to safeguard peace. Foreign Minister Titulescu responded by saying that French foreign policy is based on the collective security system and the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant. Britain and France hold completely identical views, which is the best guarantee of security and peace. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>荷政府决定擴充軍備</h3>
<p>The Dutch Government Decides to Expand its Military</p>
<p>Responding to Extraordinary Circumstances; Supported by Various Political Parties</p>
<p>⊙ The Hague.  During last night's discussion of the military preparedness plan in the Lower House, the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party abandoned their long-held positions and voted in favor of military expansion. This is the first time such a move has been made since 1915. Defense Minister Dijxhoorn declared that the Netherlands' military expansion is absolutely necessary due to the increasing tension in the international situation and the increasingly active military expansion movements of various countries. However, the Netherlands should expand its military strength independently to protect its own interests, without entrusting it to other countries or holding staff headquarters talks with any country.

<h3>美棉豐收</h3>
<p>American Cotton Bumper Crop</p>
<p>Breaks Records</p>
<p>[London] The Financial News today published an editorial on the cotton problem, stating that the abundance of this year's American cotton harvest is breaking records, but is mostly not needed at this time. Not only is the American harvest abundant this year, but China's production is also huge. Although the quantity appears to be less than in 1936-37, and Chinese consumption is expected to decrease, it is still more than enough. Japan may ship to India, which is currently the only place where textile activity is being maintained. However, the total consumption for 1937-38 may not exceed 29 million bales, while the total supply is more than 51 million bales. The newspaper also discussed the future of the cotton industry, saying that the recent unfavorable factors have greatly offset the major factor of transferring cotton to government loans, and the idea of forced control of cotton harvests is becoming increasingly vague, as agricultural bills are unlikely to pass the House and be approved by President Roosevelt during this session of the U.S. Congress. However, absorbing cotton and converting it into loans may maintain the stability of cotton prices in the near future. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Japanese Special Envoy to Europe, Ishii, Meets with British Prime Minister</p>
<p>Declares Respect for British Interests in China; Japanese Ambassador to Austria Returns Home to Discuss the European Situation</p>
<p>[London] Ishii met with Prime Minister Chamberlain at 5:00 PM today for a half-hour discussion. It is claimed that this trip is purely personal in nature. He met with Mussolini in Rome and discussed the situation in the Far East, but the details of their conversation have not been released. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the visit of Viscount Ishii, a member of the Japanese Privy Council, to Britain, diplomatic sources here recently declared that the main goal of Ishii's trip is to explain to the British authorities that Japan respects the important interests that Britain maintains in China. Whether Ishii discussed the mediation of the Sino-Japanese war when he visited Foreign Minister Eden yesterday and Prime Minister Chamberlain today is still unknown. However, well-informed sources claimed that the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, recently visited Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and mentioned the mediation issue, and asked about Japan's peace terms "for purely reference" purposes. Hirota replied that Japan cannot prematurely formulate peace terms, but is extremely willing for other countries to recognize that China and Japan must negotiate directly. Regarding this point, the general public in Britain believes that direct negotiations between China and Japan mean that Japan will completely control China. If Britain wants to step in and mediate to urge China to accept direct negotiations, then Britain should refuse to do so. As for the policy that Britain is pursuing regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, it is currently focusing on protecting its own interests. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Former Japanese Ambassador to Austria, Tani Masayuki, spoke to visiting reporters today about the Sino-Japanese war, saying that the world has now entered an era of transformation, and Japan must work hard to meet it.

<h3>于斌主敎談中日戰局</h3>
<p>Bishop Yu Pin Discusses the Sino-Japanese War Situation</p>
<p>Says that Even if Nanjing Falls, We Will Still Resist to the End</p>
<p>[Paris] Bishop Yu Pin of the Nanjing Diocese met with reporters here today and declared that China's unification and completion were achieved under the continuous efforts of General Chiang Kai-shek, and construction was making rapid progress when the Far East Incident broke out, interrupting it. Mr. Yu continued that the Communist Party in China had suffered a decisive defeat, and the anti-communist movement was naturally generated by the people because the Communist Party itself had major differences with traditional Chinese concepts. The real reason for Japan's invasion of China is definitely not communism, and "anti-communism" is just a pretext to cover up their atrocities. Mr. Yu continued that the Chinese soldiers and civilians are now determined to "rather die than submit." Mr. Yu himself believes that justice will ultimately prevail and that China's future is very promising. As for if Nanjing were to fall, it would not indicate the collapse of the resistance, because from an economic point of view, Nanjing is not the center. General Chiang Kai-shek has unlimited funds to carry out a long-term resistance. The Chinese people are inherently fond of peace, but now the whole country is of one mind, and there is no second thought other than resisting aggression and persisting to the end. Mr. Yu continued that since the outbreak of the war, China has felt a great lack of medical supplies and equipment. Although church personnel are enthusiastic about rescue and relief, they are still insufficient. He will issue a special booklet in the coming days to appeal for this. (Haishang Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Bishop Yu Pin recently arrived here from Rome and is scheduled to give a public lecture on the Far East situation tomorrow. He spoke to reporters from Havas News Agency, explaining the gist of his lecture, roughly saying that China is currently suffering from aggression, which is extremely unfair. However, we cannot blame the Japanese nation for this responsibility, because China is not fighting the Japanese nation, but the Japanese warlords. The Japanese army launched a sudden attack, and the Chinese side may have been caught off guard and taken advantage of, but they have not been defeated. After the Chinese government moved its capital to Chongqing, Nanjing City has lost its political importance. Even if it falls, there is no reason to be discouraged. From a military point of view, just look at the map of China and you can see that the vast majority of China is still loyal to General Chiang Kai-shek. "He also said that the Chinese Catholic Church is now working with the Chinese government to promote the country's revival. Many outstanding members of Chinese society also believe in Catholicism. Even General Chiang Kai-shek's record of the Xi'an Incident mentions his faith in Christ, and the words are great and truly admirable. (Has News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Dr. Hu Shih said in a speech at the Women's Press Club today, "Regardless of what happens to Nanjing, China will continue to resist Japan. Even if it takes another two or three years, we will not care." Dr. Hu also said that Generalissimo Chiang recently sent him a telegram, confirming that the fall of Nanjing will not end China's resistance. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>對日實施經濟制裁</h3>
<p>Economic Sanctions Against Japan</p>
<p>It Will Not Work Without American Participation - The Opinion of Professor Staley</p>
<p>[New York] The League of Nations Association of this city published a small booklet of essays by Professor Staley today, advocating economic sanctions against Japan. According to Mr. Staley, if the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands can jointly impose economic sanctions on Japan, it will be enough to control Japan's fate. Mr. Staley researched several policies of the United States regarding this Far East war and believes that joint economic sanctions against Japan by various countries are better than the United States' separate declaration of neutrality, because the losses suffered by the United States in the joint economic sanctions against Japan by various countries are far smaller than the neutral policy of not supplying arms to both China and Japan. Mr. Staley also said that economic sanctions against Japan cannot be effective without the participation of the United States. Otherwise, not only will it be ineffective, but it will also endanger the economies of other countries. Because the United States supplies 31% of Japan's total imports, and the United States accepts 22% of Japan's total exports. Therefore, the participation of the United States in sanctions against Japan can only have full effect. On the contrary, the United States will not be greatly affected, because even if American women each sacrifice a pair of silk stockings, it can be done. At the same time, not buying Japanese raw silk will not increase the number of unemployed workers in the American silk weaving industry. If artificial silk and cotton yarn are substituted in these industries, there is nothing wrong with it. After the American silk weaving industry widely uses artificial silk and cotton yarn, the artificial silk industry and the spinning industry will definitely see a big boost. Therefore, the existing unemployed workers will not only not increase, but will also become even less numerous due to the sanctions against Japan. (Guomin News Agency, 9th)</p>

<h3>蘇州無錫郵員撤退抵滬</h3>
<p>Suzhou and Wuxi Postal Workers Withdraw and Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>More Than Two Hundred People Arrive by Detour; Temporarily Accommodated by the Shanghai Administration</p>
<p>Suzhou and Wuxi, having fallen successively into war zones, a large number of local postal workers detoured to Shanghai and are temporarily accommodated by the Shanghai Postal Administration. Details are explored as follows:</p>
<p>Postal Workers from Suzhou and Wuxi Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Suzhou and Wuxi, since successively falling into war zones, local post offices have been unable to operate, and postal workers have withdrawn one after another. Those who detoured to Shanghai, including more than 130 people belonging to the Suzhou Post Office and more than 80 people belonging to the Wuxi Post Office, totaled more than 210 people. All of them have experienced hardships on the road and are extremely tired.</p>
<p>Temporarily Accommodated by the Shanghai Bureau</p>
<p>The Suzhou and Wuxi Post Offices are directly under the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu Postal District (the administration is in Nanjing) and do not belong to the scope of the Shanghai Postal District. However, since there is currently a war in Nanjing, the Shanghai Postal Administration is temporarily accommodating the postal workers in consideration of their actual difficulties. However, the postal economy will inevitably become more difficult.</p>
<p>Sorting Mail from War Zones</p>
<p>All mail to and from war zones accumulated in the bureau has been ordered to be collected by the recipients within a time limit. Those who have not collected it by the deadline will be returned to the senders. As a result of the above efforts, it has gradually been sorted out. However, sometimes the senders have also moved to other war zones, making it difficult to clear this type of mail. Therefore, it can only be stored in the bureau for collection. Therefore, it is not easy to clear everything out.</p>
<h3>寗波現狀</h3>
<p>The Current Situation in Ningbo</p>
<p>The Wind of Relocation Has Slightly Subsided; The Economic Center of Gravity Shifts to Rural Towns</p>
<p>Since the Jiangbei bank of Ningbo was bombed last month, the residents of the city have moved to the countryside one after another. According to people who arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo recently, the relocation wind has slightly subsided. The Dongmen area, which was the most prosperous commercial center in Ningbo, was mostly closed, but recently the shops have opened their doors, so the city looks a little better. However, the number of residents in the city has obviously decreased, so most of the shops are sparsely populated. Therefore, general businesses that are good at taking advantage of opportunities have opened branches in the rural towns with the largest concentration of people. Small businesses that sell for a living have also gone to the countryside to catch up with the market. Therefore, the prosperity of rural commerce is gradually replacing the city. As a result, the money shops in the Jiangxia area are also planning to set up offices in the countryside to meet the needs and to circulate finance. Therefore, the economic center of gravity of Ningbo city is invisibly shifting to rural towns.</p>
<h3>海寗近况</h3>
<p>The Current Situation in Haining</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met Jin Yunqing, a fellow villager from Haining who arrived in Shanghai on the German ship Pinglun, and talked in detail about the local situation in Haining. On the 9th of last month, Japanese aircraft bombed Dadongmen and dropped three bombs. One fell into the sea, and two fell inside Dadongmen, destroying five bungalows, killing two people, and injuring seven people. After the residents were frightened, they fled, either to nearby villages or to the Shanghai area. The urban area is almost deserted, and most of the shops are closed. In general, small shops only open one door to serve the market. However, the vegetable vendors in the morning all enter the city from the northwest gates and still sell on the streets. There is still enough rice and grain, and the price is about 10 yuan per load. Only the northwest two city gates are open. The south gate has been nailed shut, and Dadongmen and Xiaodongmen are closed and guarded. All the bridges outside the city have been demolished, such as Ping'an Bridge, Guanyin Bridge, and Xiahe Yijia Bridge and Mi's Bridge. Civilians who want to go to the countryside have to detour from afar to Ping'an Bridge and pass through after inspection. Japanese planes occasionally fly over the border, but have not yet dropped bombs. Mr. Jin took a boat from Haining to Xiaosibu on the opposite bank on the 6th of this month, then hired a boat to Tangtou by water, about 50 Chinese miles, and then took a small ferry to Shaoxing, took a train to Ningbo, and took a boat to Shanghai, taking about three and a half days.</p>
<h3>松江一片焦土</h3>
<p>Songjiang is a Scorched Earth</p>
<p>Maintenance Cannot Be Started</p>
<p>Since Songjiang fell on the 9th of last month, there has been no news at all. Recently, according to occasional visitors from Songjiang to Shanghai, the situation in Songjiang City is that everything east of Pingqiao to Huayang Bridge is still relatively intact. Outside the city, west of Xiuye Bridge, there is little damage, except for a few bombs that landed in a few places. The rest, from Pingqiao in the city to the west, to Xiuye Bridge to the east, has completely become a field of rubble. Especially the so-called Yue Temple Street, the gathering place of essence, has mostly been reduced to ashes. Judging from this situation, the market in Songjiang will not be able to recover in three or four decades. The current security in Songjiang is said to be maintained by six self-defense groups in the city, with farmers recruited as members, specializing in patrolling and carrying military supplies for the Japanese army. The leaders of the groups are Gu Wunyao of Huayang Bridge, Chen Liuzhang of Dongmen, Yin Ruisheng of Nanmen, Liao Zhaoxu of Beimen, Zhang Jiliang of Ximen (the former local security chief), and Yao Defeng in the city. The general leader is Lei Junyan, the director of the Songjiang Library. Everything is under the command of the propaganda team, so it is quite peaceful. However, the places where the essence of the city is gathered, both inside and outside the city, are all ruins. Even during the day, there are few pedestrians, and at night it is even more of a scene of ghosts crying and gods wailing, a desolate and turbulent scene. It is said that someone is planning to return to Songjiang to manage the local area, which is very rare. However, in this landscape of devastation, under a pile of tiles and stones, it is not known where to start.</p>
<h3>盛澤來客談工廠均已停閉</h3>
<p>A Visitor from Shengze Talks About Factories That Have All Closed</p>
<p>Local Order is Chaotic; Bandits are Rampant</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, who came to Shanghai from Shengze, recently said that since Shengze fell into the war zone, residents have moved to Shuanglin Town one after another. Shuanglin Town was also lost on the 21st, and most of the residents moved to remote villages. Japanese troops pass through every day, but do not station there. The local order in the area has recently become extremely chaotic because the intelligentsia has all left, leaving no one to maintain it. As a result, bandits are rampant, robbing arbitrarily everywhere. North Street in Shengze, which was once the area where shops clustered and the market was most lively, most of the houses have been burned down, leaving only broken walls and ruins. Many shops in Shanghang Street in the city have also been burned down. Shengze was originally a place where silk was produced. Since the war, all factories have been closed.</p>

<h3>曹家渡商民請派探警</h3>
<p>駐守要路　以儆賊膽</p>
<p>Merchants and residents of the Caojiadu area in western Shanghai are requesting the authorities to dispatch detectives to guard key roads in order to deter thieves. Since the outbreak of the war, robberies and thefts have occurred frequently in the Caojiadu area in western Shanghai, causing much distress to the local merchants and residents. They are planning to jointly petition the Concession authorities to deploy additional detectives to guard key intersections in order to deter thieves, suppress crime, and ensure local security.</p>

<h3>新北京輪裝載首批國米抵滬</h3>
<p>共五百担係由溫州運來　貢米約五萬包今日抵埠　國米暗盤每担二十元</p>
<p>The first batch of national rice, totaling 500 dan (approximately 50,000 bags), procured by various rice industry groups in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the "New Beijing" steamer. The second batch of foreign rice from the miscellaneous grains industry, and five batches of foreign rice from the Dufa Trading Company are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. The Rice Merchants Association has issued a notice regarding the distribution of rice in the French Concession. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>首批國米昨晨抵滬</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grains, Beans, and Rice Merchants Associations, in order to alleviate the food shortage in Shanghai, procured national rice from eastern Zhejiang. The first batch of 500 dan, shipped on the British Swire Shipping Company's "New Beijing" steamer, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Wenzhou, berthing at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. The cargo was immediately unloaded and temporarily stored in the Jinliyuan warehouse. It is reported that the Miscellaneous Grains industry planned to purchase a total of 300,000 dan of rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo, with each county supplying 100,000 dan. However, due to the counties' need to maintain their own food supply, they refused to allow Shanghai merchants to make large-scale purchases, thus the full amount could not be procured.</p>
<p>國米行市尚未開出</p>
<p>Since the disruption of transportation in Shanghai, the city has relied entirely on foreign rice to maintain its food supply. The national rice reserves in various rice shops were long ago sold out, and the supply has been cut off for a long time. Porridge shops are waiting for the arrival of national rice to resume business. The first batch of national rice that arrived in Shanghai yesterday amounted to only 500 dan. However, the total cost, including shipping, is approximately 14 yuan in national currency per dan (160 jin). Currently, the rice shops have not yet started selling, so there is no official market price. It is rumored that the black market price is 20 yuan in national currency per dan. In addition, there are approximately 20,000 dan of national rice on rice boats in Nanshi (Chinese City), and repeated negotiations with the Japanese side to release them have not yielded any results.</p>
<p>外輪兩艘載米來滬</p>
<p>The Yongda Company of the Miscellaneous Grains industry has ordered 100,000 bags of foreign rice from the Hengfeng Rice Company in Saigon, to be shipped to Shanghai in four batches. The first batch has already arrived in Shanghai. The second batch of 26,000 bags, shipped on the "Marguerite Maison" steamer, is expected to arrive at 4:00 PM today and will berth at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The third batch of 29,000 bags and the fourth batch of 25,000 bags will arrive in Shanghai successively within this month. The French company Dufa Trading Company has ordered an additional 50,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, to be shipped to Shanghai in two voyages. The first ship (i.e., the fifth batch) is the British Swire Company's "Chengdu" steamer, which is expected to arrive at 11:00 AM today and will berth at the buoys on the Bund in the French Concession. The total for several months is more than 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>公會辦理法界派米</p>
<p>The Rice Merchants Association has completed the registration for the distribution of the fifth batch of rice from Dufa Trading Company. The rice will be distributed according to the registered numbers after it arrives in Shanghai. Yesterday, another notice was issued regarding the distribution of rice to rice shops in the French Concession: "To whom it may concern, the French Municipal Council and this association have agreed to distribute rice once again to each of the 100 rice shops in the French Concession. We have scheduled from the 11th to the 12th of this month for you to prepare the payment and bring 10 yuan for miscellaneous expenses to the association to fill out the rice purchase application form. The time is from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The deadline will not be extended. This notice is hereby given."</p>
<h3>浦江上游小輪絡繹</h3>
<p>日軍運糧食軍火</p>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News", currently, thirty to forty small steamers and tugboats flying Japanese flags are constantly traveling back and forth between the Bund and various locations upstream of the Huangpu River every other day. It is believed that the Japanese army is currently using these to transport military supplies and food, passing through Minhang and Songjiang and entering the interior. Two or three small steamers and tugboats, fully loaded with goods, are often seen at the former blockade area of the Huangpu River in Nanshi, heading upstream.</p>
<h3>東昌路開放居民回鄕探視</h3>
<p>經過盤問搜査後放行　房屋未燬者盜竊一空</p>
<p>The so-called "Great Road Municipal Government" in Pudong yesterday continued to establish a police headquarters and reopened the Dongchang Road ferry terminal, which had been closed for a month, allowing boats to travel between the east and west banks of the Huangpu River to transport passengers. The ferry terminal on the west bank is located at Jinliyuan Wharf, north of Shiliupu. Those who have taken refuge in Puxi and wish to visit Pudong can take these boats across the river, with a fare of 10 copper coins, but boatmen charge 5 cents. Passengers disembark at Pengjia Wharf at the Dongchang Road entrance, where they undergo a police search before proceeding. After passing by two square tables, they must provide detailed information about their name, age, place of origin, address (number and street) in Pudong, and occupation. After this information is recorded in detail, they undergo a second search before being released. Several soldiers are stationed nearby to monitor the process without uttering a word. There are no restrictions on movement on the streets, but houses are sealed with notices by the police. Those who wish to enter their homes must first register at the Pudong branch before being allowed to remove the seals. Although several hundred people went to Pudong yesterday, upon returning home, those whose houses had not been destroyed found that their belongings had been completely looted, indicating the prevalence of thieves during the chaos. Visitors were quite disappointed. Moreover, the supply of electricity and running water has been cut off, and stores have not reopened, making it impossible to purchase daily necessities. Even cigarettes, which cost five cents in the city, cost ten cents at a tobacco stall in Pudong. Therefore, those who went to Pudong yesterday and witnessed this situation were not considering returning anytime soon. Regarding the towns along the river, Yangjing Town has been largely destroyed by bombing, while Lujiazhai, Laiyi Ferry, and Tangqiao three towns have suffered the most severe fires and no longer resemble their former state. Only Yangjiadu and Laobaidu are relatively intact, with some poor people residing there. Other areas are desolate and remain extremely desolate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to those who have personally visited Pudong, they are welcomed if they bring luggage with them, but they are not allowed to take anything from Pudong back to Puxi.</p>

<h3>浦江渡輪昨又停開</h3>
<p>高橋綫被阻　浮碼頭遷移</p>
<p>The Pudong Gaoqiao ferry line was disrupted again yesterday afternoon. The reason was that three barges towed by the German Lihua Company's "Xiaojiangnan" ferry did not have licenses, so they were detained at Gaoqiao during the first trip in the morning. Only the small tugboat returned to Puxi, while the "Xinjiannan" and "Laojiangnan" ferries were also turned back on their second trip. The British Maqin Company's "Dina" ferry, after two round trips, temporarily suspended operations due to the need to refuel. Therefore, the Shanghai-Gaoqiao line was completely cut off yesterday afternoon. According to another source, the ferry from Puxi to Pudong was blocked and turned back on its first trip. The Gaoqiao pontoon wharf has been towed to the fish market, and passengers have been refunded their tickets. It has not reopened since then. However, there is talk of restoring service on the Shangnan Railway and the ferries from the Zhoujiadu area in Pudong.</p>
<h3>大南門一帶最近火災</h3>
<p>蓬萊市塲一部　為流彈所炸燬</p>
<p>The fire in Nanshi recently burned down the Dafochang Temple (i.e., Zhenhai Temple) outside the Dananmen gate, spreading to the Zhang surname primary school, the Zhujufeng second-hand store on Kualong Road, as well as grocery stores, barber shops, and brick and ash businesses, up to Caijia Lane. A corner of Gaochang Sitong was also destroyed. It is reported that it was open for two hours on the morning of the 5th of this month and that it was safe to visit. According to witnesses, a small part of the Penglai Market was destroyed by stray bullets. There are also refugee shelters in the market and in the Confucian Temple, but they are all for the poor, elderly, and weak.</p>
<h3>蘇州河北秩序漸復</h3>
<p>居戶大部遷回　捕房加意防護</p>
<p>Residents in the area north of the Suzhou Creek within the jurisdiction of the Huisi Police Station had previously moved out due to the war. The order in the area has gradually been restored, and most of the residents have returned. The police station is currently ordering detectives to conduct separate investigations to estimate the number of returning residents. Regarding the defense of the area, in addition to the British troops guarding the border, Chief Detective Shang Wu has also transferred a large number of detectives to be on guard within the boundary and on the bridges.</p>
<h3>各界籌備撫慰災童</h3>
<p>本市難民三十萬人、災童佔三分之一强、約十一萬名、生活顚沛、情殊慘楚、本市各界以轉瞬聖誕節將屆、致倡導撫慰災童運動、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>The city's 300,000 refugees include approximately 110,000 children, accounting for more than one-third of the total. Their lives are precarious and their situation is dire. With the imminent approach of Christmas, various sectors of the city are advocating for a movement to comfort the children affected by the disaster. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>徵求恩物分贈災童</p>
<p>To comfort the children affected by the disaster, the International Relief Committee has issued a public announcement to all sectors and sent letters to major companies and factories such as Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, Great World, and Kang Yuan, requesting the collection of candies, toys, and other gifts. Donations have been pouring in to the committee in recent days. At the same time, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association has also sent letters to various churches, expanding the fundraising effort to distribute Christmas gifts to the children. The effort has received enthusiastic support from church members, and a large-scale collection is currently underway. It is reported that various charitable organizations are also planning to create special "Christmas Gift Bags" to contain the donated items and distribute them to the children in the shelters at that time.</p>
<p>災童衣服呼籲捐助</p>
<p>There is a severe shortage of winter clothing for children affected by the disaster. Although the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association has allocated 4,000 yuan specifically for making children's clothing, the International Relief Committee estimates that this is insufficient. Therefore, they are earnestly hoping that all sectors will donate children's clothing or donate funds specifically for purchasing children's clothing before Christmas, so that every child will have sufficient clothing to resist the severe cold by Christmas.</p>
<p>派員慰問擧行集會</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, various charitable organizations will send representatives to visit the children's shelters to offer comfort. On this day, the instructors in the shelters will also hold children's gatherings, where they will distribute gifts, tell stories, or perform music to entertain the children's minds and bodies. In recent days, many students from various schools have purchased reading materials or donated their old books to relief organizations, which will also be distributed to the children on Christmas Day for their reading pleasure.</p>
<h3>一角捐運動意義在於“一人救一難民”</h3>
<p>每四人中如有一人實行一角捐　則難民給養問題卽可全部解决</p>
<p>The significance of the "One Cent Donation Campaign" lies in "One person saves one refugee." If one in every four people contributes one cent, the refugee feeding problem can be completely solved.</p>
<p>The International Relief Committee issued a letter to all sectors yesterday to promote the "One Cent Donation Campaign," stating that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, there have been no fewer than hundreds of thousands of refugees in need of assistance. After sending some back to their hometowns, there are still more than 250,000 refugees sheltered in this city. Although charitable individuals from all walks of life have generously donated large sums, the large number of people who are crying out for food makes long-term relief difficult. The significance of the Daily One Cent Donation Campaign lies in "One Person Saves One Refugee." Saving one cent per person per day can sustain one refugee for one day; collecting three yuan per month can sustain one refugee for one month. Considering that Shanghai has a population of 3.5 million, at least 1 million people can afford to support themselves. Currently, there are about 250,000 refugees, creating a ratio of 1 to 4. On average, if one in four people participates in the Daily One Cent Donation Campaign, the long-term feeding problem of 250,000 refugees can be completely solved. Although this campaign is called "Daily One Cent Donation Campaign," it requires accumulating one month's worth to reach the unit of three yuan. Those who are able can donate more units, and thus save more lives each month. If donors wish to know the situation of the refugees, the committee will write their names on a cloth strip and hang it on the chest of the refugees they are helping to show that this refugee is being assisted by a particular person. Donors can also inquire about the living conditions of the refugees they are helping at any time. This measure can both commend the generosity of the donors and establish a direct relationship with the refugees being helped. To stimulate the interest of donors, the committee has specially prepared a "One Cent Donation Campaign Commemorative Badge." One badge will be given for each unit donated to commend their generosity and as a souvenir. The committee believes that the One Cent Donation Campaign will definitely have good results in the future, because saving one cent per person per day is a small amount that is easy to do. Shanghai is not lacking in charitable people. We hope that you will sympathize with the suffering of the refugees who are crying out for food and cold, actively donate and promote the campaign, and generously donate more units to save more lives. The merit of this deed is boundless. All donations should be sent directly to the committee on the third floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, and a solemn statement should be attached. This committee does not send personnel to solicit donations from outside to prevent malpractice. If various sectors, companies, and organizations voluntarily launch collections and submit them to the committee after accumulating a certain amount, we will issue receipts as proof. We hope the public will understand.</p>

<p>Xu Jia Hui will levy donations and taxes.</p>
<p>When our army withdrew from Xujiahui Town in western Shanghai, due to the Catholic Church's presence, the town's security was maintained by French soldiers and Chinese and Western detectives from the police station. Boundary lines were drawn, wire mesh was installed, and defensive measures were taken, ensuring the safety of that corner of the town. The required water and electricity were also supplied by the French side. However, since the dissolution of the municipal government, the collection of various donations and taxes has been completely suspended. The French authorities are now seeking to improve the town's road administration and sanitation facilities, and are constantly planning for the necessary expenses. Recently, they invited Zhou Chengxiang, a representative of the town's merchants and residents, and other relevant parties to discuss the temporary levy of a 10% tax on shops and housing, 8% on residents, and various taxes on pigs, vegetable stalls, etc., in the special area to provide funds. All measures are still under discussion, and the date of commencement is expected to be around January of next year. It is understood that the French police station has dispatched Inspector Zhou to work with the town's household registration officers to investigate household rents in order to facilitate the process.</p>

<p>Charitable organizations continue to help refugees on the streets.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai West United Benevolent Society expanded the scope of its free medical consultations and medicine distribution and implemented long-term refugee relief efforts, donations of clothing, food, and medical expenses from all sectors have been very enthusiastic. Yesterday, it received 3,800 loaves of bread from all the tenants of the Jixiangli Residents' Association on Henan Road, 20 loaves from the staff of Hengdaxiang, four dozen woolen shirts from the Yarn Industry Association, 560 pieces of used clothing donated by Mrs. Gu and others, and the free medical consultation team received 10 yuan each in medical expenses from Ge and Shao, as well as 3 yuan from Mr. Wan. In addition to issuing receipts and distributing the donations, the society continued to issue food supply tickets to refugees on the streets. With these tickets, they can receive ten food items from the society at Chengdeli, Gordon Road, enough to last for two days. The refugees on the streets, who are generally exposed to the wind and weather, have been receiving assistance from the society for days, temporarily avoiding hunger and cold. However, for the sake of long-term sustenance, in addition to urging the responsible organizations to find ways to provide mass shelters, the society also hopes that donations of clothing and medical expenses will continue to flow in to avoid interruption. The society's telephone number is 35627. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association Refugee Relief Committee has been sheltering homeless refugees on the streets for days after choosing No. 6 Wanmaoli, North Fujian Road, as a shelter, and has already accommodated more than 200 people. It is reported that the association has continued to accommodate more than 100 people yesterday. Once it has raised funds and found suitable locations, it will continue to accommodate more people. In addition, the association received a small amount of donations yesterday, including 9 yuan per month from Zhou Xin, 10 yuan from Zhong Zhu Ruizhen, 18 yuan from Wang Yaochen, 6 yuan from Ge Futian, and 15 yuan from Zeng Wanpu. The association's office is located on the third floor of No. 59 Hong Kong Road.</p>

<h3>難民區人數驟增困難重重</h3>
<p>提早戒嚴以防宵小　米糧解決柴炭奇昂</p>
<p>With the French Concession opening the Laobei Gate iron gate, allowing refugees to enter the area permanently, the number of merchants who have moved in and reopened their businesses has been increasing day by day, and the number of refugees wandering on the streets has also reached several thousand due to being accommodated in the area. Therefore, the population in the area has suddenly increased. In order to prevent unscrupulous people from taking the opportunity to mix in and cause trouble, the area's office has advanced the curfew time every night from 6:30 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning. Anyone lingering outside during the curfew will be detained. It is also understood that the French Concession authorities are strictly checking the residents entering the area to ensure safety. Therefore, the number of people who were blocked outside and unable to enter the area yesterday was very large.</p>
<p>Most of the refugees in the Nanshi refugee area are thinly clothed, and there are many cases of typhoid fever. However, after the patients are reported to Director Xue Lisheng, a lawyer with the Red Cross Society, they are immediately transported to the temporary hospital in the Suxin Qi vegetarian noodle restaurant next to the Lotus Pond. Unfortunately, there are no Chinese medicine practitioners, and Western medicine is not well-suited to the Chinese constitution, resulting in successive deaths. Since the establishment of the refugee area, more than 200 people have died. As for the refugees in the area, most of them have now switched to changing the relief rice, half steamed buns and half rice. The area is divided into nine districts, and each district has three rice selling points designated by the district chief. The relief association sends four bags of rice to each point every day, each bag weighing 200 jin, with two bags for sale and two bags for distribution. Although the rice can be gradually solved, firewood and charcoal are extremely expensive, which is still unaffordable for refugees who live in encirclement with no livelihood.</p>
<h3>公共租界當局嚴緝盜匪</h3>
<p>連日破獲三處　抄出手槍子彈</p>
<p>The Public Concession authorities are cracking down on bandits.</p>
<p>Three locations have been raided in recent days, with handguns and bullets seized.</p>
<p>The Public Concession police authorities, in view of the increasing number of bandits in the concession, and the frequent occurrence of murder and robbery cases, have ordered the police stations to select experienced detectives to patrol in sections day and night. They have also ordered them to pay close attention to tea houses and hostels, which are places where bandit gangs often gather. At 9:45 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Ding Huaguo, Yang Yunfeng, Ma Bingzhang, and Western Detective Chief Bao Tai of the Xinzha Police Station searched various hotels in their jurisdiction. When they searched Room 17 of the Pingqiao Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road, they found four bandits: Wang Fengshan, Li Lexiu, Xu He, and Qian Shikun, and seized a Mauser pistol and seven bullets from under the pillow. They then went to Room 322 of the Tianran Hotel on Guizhou Road and arrested three accomplices: Meng Yufu, Zhao Yixing, and Wang Asan. All of them were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. According to the police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, the defendants confessed at the police station that they had robbed a certain family on Haining Road on the 8th of this month. The gun and bullets were borrowed by the defendant Li Lexiu from Li Lianzhong, who is on the run. The presiding judge reviewed the confession and ordered that the suspects be detained for seven days for further investigation and questioning.</p>
<p>In addition, Lu Liankui, Chinese Chief Inspector of the General Investigation Department, Detective Feng Zhiming, and Detective Zhang Yunsheng arrested a Ningbo native, Wu Haichao, a bandit, at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and North Suzhou Road at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, and seized a Lianpeng handgun. According to Wu's confession, they also arrested two Ningbo natives, Zhou Muxin, and a woman named Zhou Xu, at No. 16, Lane 794, Haining Road, and seized a Lianpeng handgun and eleven bullets. It was found that Wu and others had attempted to rob Zhang Zuhong's fortune-telling hall at No. 529 Baik Road on the 2nd of this month while armed. Moreover, Central and Western detectives from the Laoza Police Station learned that someone was selling military firearms in Room 42 of the Zhongxin Hotel at No. 11, Lane 522, Hankou Road. So they rushed there the day before yesterday and arrested two Ningbo natives, Fu Arong and Chen Ayue, and seized a Dimeng handgun and seven bullets from the roof. The above two cases were sent to the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, requested a postponement of the trial because all the cases required further investigation. The presiding judge of the Criminal Court, Qian Hongye, questioned the defendants and granted the postponement for one week for further questioning.</p>
<h3>法租界添招探捕</h3>
<p>警局警探紛往應徵　略加訓練分配工作</p>
<p>The French Concession is recruiting additional detectives and police officers.</p>
<p>Police station detectives are rushing to apply, receiving brief training and being assigned to work.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the number of residents in the Concession has increased several times compared to before the war, resulting in rampant petty crime, robbery, and murder cases, and that the winter defense is approaching, and that they are also responsible for the police and security in the Huajie area of Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai and the refugee area in the city, the French Police Department has added 50 Chinese detectives and 250 Chinese police officers to allocate defense duties. It is reported that most of the applicants for the recruited detectives and police officers are former police station detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department and various branches that have been closed down and dissolved. They are relatively familiar with police work. After a brief training, they will be assigned to patrol day and night in shifts to protect the shops and residents in the area and suppress theft.</p>

<h3>"Great Avenue Municipal Government" Appoints Another Water Patrol Captain</h3>
<p>Finance, Social Affairs, and Transportation Bureaus Jointly Establish an Office – Rumors of Another Organization on the Nanshi Side – Ma Ziyun Declares No Involvement in Administrative Matters, Etc.</p>
<p>Regarding Ma Zhiyun, the water patrol captain announced by the "Great Avenue Municipal Government" in Pudong, it is now known that he did not take office yesterday. His position as water patrol captain has been filled by the promoted head of the Bailianjing Water Patrol Subdivision, and there is talk of Xu San filling a team member position. All other team captains have already taken office. Furthermore, the Finance, Social Affairs, and Transportation Bureaus have only established a joint office for now, and have been recruiting former staff members in recent days. It is now said that a small number of lower-level staff have already taken office. At the same time, there is a gradual organization on the Nanshi side. Anyone going to Nanshi can obtain leaflets from the Comforting Band at the edge of the refugee area. Registering at the Xicheng Elementary School will allow one to become a citizen of Nanshi again in the future. As for the previously rumored establishment of a permit office within the local court, presided over by Chen Xiqing, it has now been investigated and found that the local court is only an occupied organ, and there is no Chen Xiqing within it. The person in charge is a local security guard, Yang, who is handling cooking duties. The cooking place uses the large cauldrons in the former detention center. The Guangxia building of the Firefighting Joint Association on Zhonghua Road in Xiaonanmen has now been converted into a club. Furthermore, the Confucius Temple in Nanshi and the remaining</p>
<p>Penglai Market now also have refugee areas. All elderly and weak people who have not escaped into the refugee area are ordered to reside within them and are provided with food. At the same time, ships detained in the Huangpu River, whose boatmen are at risk of starvation, were each provided with one dou (approximately 10 liters) of rice yesterday.</p>
<p>Ma Ziyun's Letter: Mr. Ma Ziyun wrote to this newspaper yesterday, saying: "To the Editor, Having read in your December 10th issue that the so-called Great Avenue Municipal Government Police Bureau appointed Ma Ziyun as the water patrol captain, I have been employed at the Jiangsu Shangbao Ma Hui Soda Tax Office for many years, and I am in no way involved in local administrative matters. The Ma Ziyun appointed by the government as water patrol captain must be another person. Fearing that there may be misunderstandings from the outside world, I am writing to request that your newspaper issue a correction immediately. I would be deeply grateful. Sincerely, Ma Ziyun. December 10th."</p>
<h3>Issuance of Purchase Certificates Limited to Original Business</h3>
<p>Merchants in this city who purchase goods from the interior must rely on certificates issued by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to transport them. Currently, there are merchants in this city who originally operated in Business A but are now switching to Business B, or who have never been in business but are now temporarily selling goods for profit. All of these are requesting the Chamber of Commerce to provide certificates. The Chamber of Commerce believes that each industry has a specific scope of business. The purchase certificates issued by the Chamber can only be limited to members of legally established and well-organized trade associations. To prevent abuses and avoid confusion, requests for certificates from people outside the industry or non-members will not be processed.</p>

<h3>Opium Dens Move Illegally to Concessions</h3>
<p>Raided on Rue P. Henry. One Main Culprit at Large, Hearing Postponed.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Nanshi, transportation has been disrupted for various special goods and opium dens in the Ji畝地 and Lao Beimen areas of the Chinese district. As a result, business operations have become quite inconvenient for each establishment, so they have all transported opium illegally into the concessions for secret sales. After the French Concession Police learned of this, they dispatched investigators to suppress the activity. Repeatedly, raids were made and those captured were sent to the courts for interrogation. The matter has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Now, from the French Police, Inspector Qian Chenglong, Detectives Xue Youlin, Xu Daorong, etc., have learned that at No. 13, Yukang Alley entrance, Rue P. Henry outside Xiaobei Men, someone has privately set up an opium den to secretly sell. Therefore, at noon the day before yesterday, they rushed to the front building of the house at the address, arrested three opium dealers: Chen Haichen, Huang Henian, and Guo Huaisheng, and seized fifteen packages of opium (each package one tael, previously priced at three yuan on the market, but has gradually risen since the war, and is now as high as sixteen or seventeen yuan), as well as account books, steelyard scales, abacuses, and other items. They were taken to the police station and yesterday were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Sun Penghan presided over the interrogation. The police attorney presented the case and requested a postponement of the investigation, stating that there was still a main culprit at large. Detectives reported the details of the raid and presented the opium and other items to the court. The court verified the report and interrogated the defendants. It was decided to postpone the hearing to investigate the matter further. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
