<h3>敵兩度反攻匯山碼頭</h3>
<p>我軍奮勇接戰先後擊退　殘敵已呈現總動搖模樣　浦東方面數度發生砲戰</p>
<p>（本報特訊）確息、自我軍前晚佔領匯山碼頭後、將敵軍全綫、完全切斷、昨日下午四時許、敵軍傾全力反攻、以鐵甲車坦克車猛衝數次、冀圖奪回、我軍奮勇抵禦、激戰甚烈、敵終不得逞、昨晚九時、敵軍二度又來反攻、我軍以機槍掃射小鋼砲猛轟、雙方鑾戰、較前更為劇烈某一時間、我軍頗陷於苦戟、未幾援軍趕到、聲勢驟盛、當時機槍鋼砲之聲、歷歷可聞、我軍奮勇挺進、今晨一時、已將敵軍擊退、八字橋前綫之敵、自我佔領匯山碼頭後、軍心慌亂、狼狽不堪、勢非後退不可矣、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）我軍砲隊、昨與浦江敵艦、又有數度互矗、下午四時許、砲聲突起、僅數響卽止、下午六時半、又有連續之砲聲、已較前為烈、約有十餘分鐘之久、迨晚間十時、砲戰最為劇烈、隆隆不絕、雜以機關槍聲、半小時後始止、</p>
<p>據確息、我軍佔領匯山碼頭後、自唐山路至堤藍橋一帶敵軍、以西北兩面遭擊、無險可守、乃於昨日狼狽澈退、我軍已進駐該地云、</p>
<p>日軍之指揮部、目前似設於外虹橋至紹商北綫之間、敵方高級長官、常出入於外虹橋一帶地段、</p>
<p>虹口公園附近之敵軍、昨日屢次向我猛攻、企圖衝出重圍、均經我軍擊退、敵軍傷亡甚多、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）滬東區日本郵船會社碼頭附近、雙方砲戰、敵頗受損失、嘉興路一帶曾起巷戰、江中日艦又同北站發砲我軍猛烈還擊、損失不詳</p>
<h3>敵彈擊中美旗艦</h3>
<p>當時炸死美兵一人　負傷者共有十八人</p>
<p>中央社云、昨晚六時四十分、停泊於浦江之日艦、發砲轟擊我南市及浦東一帶、有一砲彈落於停泊江海關前之美國旗艦奧葛斯脫號之甲板上、當時炸死美兵一人、並傷十八人、其中五人重傷云、</p>
<p>我外部於前日下午、通知各國使領、凡各國在滬之兵艦及商輪、須於十二小時之内、遠離日艦停泊地點五海里之外、或使日艦遠離各國兵艦及商輪停泊地點五海里之外、該項通知、於昨晨三時届滿、記者昨日下午親往外灘視察、英美各軍艦、乃泊原處、並未移動、日艦仍在白渡橋之外、其間相距泊於福州路外灘美海軍浮筒之美艦約計一千數百米突、</p>
<p>外艦停泊地位調查</p>
<p>昨日各外國兵艦所停泊之地位調查如下、新開河有美國差輪及小型砲艦各一艘、愛多亞路浦面有法國巡洋艦一艘、及戰鬥艦二艘、五馬路口有英國兵艦二艘、及差輪一艘、四馬路口有美國巡洋艦一艘、共計九艘、至於敵艦則停泊於外白渡橋以北之江面、</p>
<p>浦江日艦又增五艘</p>

<h3>我前綫抵裏虹橋</h3>
<p>在已佔領地築堅固陣地　敵失戰鬥力已潰不成軍</p>
<p>中央社云、我軍前夜佔領匯山碼頭切斷敵左右兩翼後、卽乘勝分東西兩路進迫、將士精神抖擻、勇氣百倍、殘敵鬥志全失、頹喪萬分、昨晨左冀紛向順泰碼頭潰退、我軍一面在已佔領之昆明路與塘山路附近建築堅固陣地、一面向前追擊、下午四時許、沿東有恒路東漢壁禮路挺進、前綫已進抵裏虹橋、現日軍左翼完全在我軍包圍中、紛亂不堪、戰鬥能力全失、已潰不成軍、勢將完全涌解决、</p>
<p>中央社云、軍息、前晚衝至匯山码頭之我軍、為□□師兩團、□□師一團、我軍進展神速、戰事至昨日下午更為激烈、敵軍不乏至死不悟之徒、憑若干險要處頑抗、惟虹口一帶、到處大火、至晚間十時許、火勢益為猛烈、殘敵也呈總動搖模樣、擬採取有效方法、將我國寬大仁愛之精神、曉諭此輩迫於殘暴軍閥淫威之無辜軍人、從遠投降、以免生靈塗炭想滬戰短期內可告結果云、</p>
<h3>敵陣地空前大火</h3>
<p>被我軍轟炸及大砲擊中　火勢之烈過於一二八役</p>
<p>昨晨六時起、楊樹浦及虹口一帶敵軍陣地、先後被我空軍轟炸、及巨砲擊中、當有三四處着火延燒、火勢甚烈、旋至午刻、虹口方面又有多處起火、烈燄高飛、黑烟蔽天、自元芳路至楊树浦一帶、形成一絕大之烟幕、上接雲霄、下临浦江、火势之烈、較之一二八時閘北之大火尤过之、實為滬上空前所未有、迨至傍晚、我國空軍再度來滬轟炸、吳淞路及百若匯路之西口又着彈起火、延燒甚烈、同時浦東之日華紗廠廠屋、亦三度着火延燒、入晚翹首東望、但見火光燭天、照耀如同白畫、迄發稿時止、尚猶未熄、敵軍在虹口及楊樹浦一帶、均憑民房為防禦物、藉圖最後之掙扎、經此大火之後、敵軍慌張狼狽、消滅之期、當不遠矣、</p>
<p>由時社云、昨日滬東區民房中彈起火者不下數十起之多、迄至下午、燃燒愈烈、蔓延益大、如虹口莊源大元芳路一帶、民房被燬者已有二三百家、其火勢最烈地點、則在百老匯路、南洋烟草公司後面一帶、自新記浜路起、至兆豐路、塘山路、東有恒路、鄧脫路、公平路以迄茂海路、昆明絡為止、該處共有民房四千餘間、昨日悉遭砲火所毀、延燒甚烈、在外灘遙望、則見烟霧潔漫、半天通紅、</p>
<h3>英軍嚴防敵潰兵</h3>
<p>外灘一帶宣佈特別戒嚴　浦江美艦高懸紅旗警戒</p>
<p>（本報特訊）自前晚我軍佔領匯山碼頭後、復於昨晨繼續向前推進、敵軍狼狽潰敗、陣地愈逼愈小、以致外白渡橋一帶、形勢突告嚴重、公共租界當局為避免意外、並防止日軍潰敗竄越外白渡橋南面起見、於昨午十二時起、特下令將外灘一帶、宣佈臨時戒嚴、斷絕交通、自外白渡橋至愛多亞路外灘、及四川路橋至北京路以東一帶區域內、禁止行人車輛通過、一方面加派英美武裝軍隊及萬國商團、在該區域內加緊戒備、情形非常緊張、本報記者聞訊、於下午三時半驅車赴外灘一帶視察由愛多亞鉻朝東抵黃浦灘路擬轉灣向北時、果被五六巡捕及一英兵向前攔阻、不准通過、記者當卽向其說明來意、並示新聞記者通行證、始准放行、而該處正有數十小工、搬運沙包、準備防禦工事、朝北一帶、向來車為塞途、行人煕禳、今則突呈冷落、人跡全無、僅見三五巡捕、與武裝英兵、往來巡邏、英·美·法·意各國軍艦、屹立江心、高懸紅旗、以示警備、砲口俱對虹口方面、南京路口、英兵與小工等忙於疊置沙包、而外灘公園前、沙包堆置、儼如碉堡、北京路口之大英銀行玻璃窗、已全部用厚木板釘沒、外白渡橋及蘇州河一帶、𨵙然無人、橋中心英兵戒備甚嚴、北京路口之華捕極力阻止記者、勿再進至橋堍、以免危險、蓋隔河敵軍、一見華人、卽行開槍、卽如余等、華捕自稱）、亦不便接近橋堍、正在徘徊觀望間、突聞空中機聲軋軋、盤旋於外白渡橋北堍日領事署屋頂上空、知係我空軍飛往轟炸、同時某處屋頂上、連發高射砲兩響、至此、記者卽驅車而返、</p>
<p>敵被解裝收容</p>

<h3>英人捐物勞傷兵</h3>
<p>函述日軍暴行終必崩潰　公道自在人心國人勉旃</p>
<p>大陸報云、著名英國著作家梅氏十九日致函大陸報、以其母所給渠之銀製儲幣器及銀製紙烟盒各一事、請大陸報記者轉送中國傷兵醫院、梅氏於二十日離滬、謂渠以身無現資、故特捐助心愛之銀器兩事、以表示贊助中國乏微忱該二物已由大陸報送交兪市長、兪市長覆函申謝、並謂將以此事報告國民政府、梅氏之函、略謂、渠為英人、故不能捐助中國戰費、惟對於奮勇抵禦侵略國軍隊而受傷之華兵、不得不略有飭助、以示敬意、該侵略國以軍隊强佔自楊樹浦至蘇州河之國際中立十地、並派巡洋艦驅逐艦至浦江中心、藉彼自己破壞的中立士為掩護、致使公共租界之無辜居民與饑餓難民受極度之危險、渠曾目視日人在滬宣傳挑釁之種種行為、商業與難民因以感受之極大困難、凡此一切、中國毫不負責、渠又目覩日兵在虹口持槍强刧英人所有之運貨汽車與其他運輸物、及日水兵以槍刺、刺傷一華婦、此皆由與文明道德毫無關係之軍閥的野心所釀成、該軍閥顯圖消滅英美法三國在華之利益、中國在全世界之友人、較其所知者為多、此輩友人皆願中國作戰、並請蔣委員長續派大軍、展廣各路戰綫、擴大戰事、以抗此侵略者、而堅持到底、勿與議和、蓋渠知日人必在陣綫後崩潰、卽日本本國之財政與經濟終必崩潰是也、至是中國可將華北滿洲與大陸全境之日本軍閥驅出、而安然進行其建設事業、與彼日本平民和好相處、蓋日本平民之不欲戰爭、與華人無異也云云、公道自在人心、觀於梅氏之函、益信然已、</p>
<p>敵佔新亞架高射砲</p>
<p>申時社云、昨日下午三時許、日軍突將北四川路天潼路新亞酒店佔據、並在該屋屋頂、架設高射砲及防空信號、一見我國飛機飛近、卽有猛烈之吼聲、發自該處、警告其軍以高射砲向我射擊、查新亞酒店、自十三日滬戰發生後、全部人員已一律遷出、將門封閉、其屋頂並懸有英國之旗、蓋該店係在香港政府註册云、</p>
<p>敵以機槍掃射渡船</p>
<p>中央社云、本市租界東區、為敵軍利用作戰、其地原為工廠區域、人烟稠密、自敵節節敗退，該區各國居民又先後避去、前日尚賴渡船、由各公共碼頭出入、紛紛逃出危險區域、昨晨起情形已特變、敵軍被逐狼狽潰退後竟在百老匯路一帶、均經構築防禦工程、時以機搶向往來船隻掃射、散小渡船已不能前往、聞有少數居民尚留該處</p>
<p>蘇州河畔敵屍飄浮</p>
<p>申時社云、昨晨九時許、蘇州河發現敵軍屍體數具、時因浦江潮漲、故皆飄入蘇州河向西而去、屍體頭上、尚戴有灰色鋼帽、諒係日昨圖襲我浦東時、被我軍所掃擊、落水溺斃云、</p>
<p>新新社云、昨據由兆豐路逃出者談、我軍於前晚佔領匯山碼頭後、敵軍因東區聯絡斷絕、恐慌非常、連夜由停泊公和祥頭敵艦、將大批軍火運送上岸、在兆豐路百老匯路一帶擇較高之房屋、設置高射砲機關槍、小鋼砲、與華德路交叉處、均布置沙袋、鐵絲網、情形甚為慌張、在三層樓屋頂、可以隱約望見我軍陣地、</p>
<p>敵軍退駐北河南路</p>
<p>蘇州河以北之北河南路一帶、本由萬國義勇隊佈防、但昨日起、已為日兵佔領、日兵並在該處小菜塲上設置小鋼砲及機關槍、記者昨晨會赴該處、見交通仍未斷絕　　惟日兵不准行人仰首探望、記者目覩國人五人、因仰首探望、被日兵擊斃、又據虹口捕房報告昨日軍已在該區內宣佈戒嚴、并駕駛鐵甲車來往巡邏、下午一時以後、靶子路東段雙方發生砲戰、旋卽停息、</p>
<p>我方檢查扣留日輪</p>
<p>在十六鋪及南黃浦所停泊之日淸公司之商輪六艘、據報內繋軍用品接濟敵艦、經我扣留、除兩艘業已沉沒外、向有四艘經我方派員前往檢查、其中一輪、艙底完全捕逻滿藏硫磺之大　、于此可見其用意之所在、</p>
<p>日人掩飾欲蓋彌彰</p>
<p>字林報云、駐滬日總領事署發言人、昨晨否認日陸軍抵滬參戰之說、謂在滬作戰者、全為海軍陸戰隊、又稱、日兵未在浦東登陸、日軍至八月十七日正午止、軍官士兵死者不足三十人、傷者約六十人、該發言人承認八月十七日之夜、東區日軍處境困難、謂此半由工部局巡捕由該區撤退所致、今者若干巡捕已回該區、於日出至日落間巡邏各街道、若輩多為日人云、（譯者按日本常備軍開滬、曾見東京電、雙方接戰數日、竟請死者不足三十人、傷者約六十人、眞虧該發言人說得出、故字林報於不足三十人與約六十人之上、加疑問記號、至於十七日之夜日軍處境困難、謂由東區巡捕澈退所致、亦奇談也、由此可證日人口中、無可信之言、）</p>
<h3>北橋閔行敵機擲彈</h3>
<p>今晨七時、北橋縣政府天空、突來敵機三架、偵察盤旋、繼卽擲下炸彈三枚、俱落空地、未受損失、</p>
<p>又閔行汽車站、在七時二十分時、飛來敵機一架、投擲一彈、後經我機多架飛來、敵機倉皇逃逸、</p>
<h3>王敬久師長談奪匯山碼頭經過</h3>
<p>王用兵極神奇勇烈　完成初步最大任務</p>
<p>我軍自滬戰開始、着着勝利、昨夜旣進佔匯山碼頭、截斷敵軍、使其左右兩翼、不能相顧、尤為抗戰以來之最大成功、記者以我軍進展神速、特在今晨（昨晨）於彈雨中、至我軍中路陣地、因友人介紹、得見負責指揮該兩路之我軍×××師師長干敬久、王帥長在一二八之役、任八十七師帥長、勇敢抗敵、累奏奇功、今再晤見於軍事緊張時、其英挺豪邁、沉着精神之概、不减當年、當其在萬忙中接見記者時、則以簡截概括之詞、說明近日前線戰况、條理井然、如數家珍、足證其胸有成竹、故能殺敵致果、疊奏慶功、</p>
<p>官兵抱必死心</p>
<p>王師長首謂、我為自衛之戰、數十年來、自甲午以迄今日、對敵人之忿怒、至目前始有發揮之機會、故全體官兵、皆能以必死之心、壯烈抗戰、但敵軍則反是、而全為日本軍閥之黷武、土兵旣出强迫、軍心自難振奮、兵書曰、攻心為上、則我軍在心理上、已早操必勝之左券矣、</p>
<p>三路會合殺敵</p>
<p>王師長首謂、我軍自接到命令、卽迅赴滬邊、佔得有利之地形、一週來、㊀、東路旣佔公大第一紗廠、卽將敵人逐入租界、繼由平凉路、黎平路挺進、肅淸殘敵、佔有裕豐、大康、各紗廠、刻則與中西兩路呼應、謀盡逐沿浦一帶之敵、㊁、中路則由高郎橋、蘭路、向西推進、已越過華德路、韜朋路、遼陽路、大連灣路、昨（卽前日）已邁進至保定路、將西牢附近之殘敵包圍、更進而與西路軍會於提籃橋、匯山碼頭、大阪碼頭之間、㊂、西路自佔日海軍操塲後、所得優勢、在幾度血戰肉搏後、卒賴我軍之神勇壯烈、摧毀敵軍堅固之砲疊戰車、由天寶路、公平路、遇過周家嘴路、塘山路、東有恒路、東漢𤩹禮路、東熙華德路、東百老匯路、以完成最大任務、於昨晚（卽前晚）佔領匯山碼頭、</p>
<p>獲敵六坦克車</p>
<p>計昨晚（卽前夜）我以××團及××團兩團兵力、由各上級軍官、浴血領導、向預訂之目標挺進、敵軍則在西牢、南洋姻公司及匯山碼頭之間、集結重兵、以鐵甲車、坦克車、機關槍、鋼砲、向我猛烈抵禦、但卒歸敗績、我軍除佔有匯山碼頭、及沿綫之重要區域外、並截獲敵軍之坦克車六輛、指揮刀數柄、其他軍用品無算、</p>
<p>頑敵殲滅不遠</p>
<p>王師長以軍務緊張、至此作一結語曰、滬上之敵、已被我截斷、殲滅之期、當不在遠、但此為我民族自衛戰之開始、故小勝不足喜、至本人身為軍人、職在衛國、小勝之後、更無可誇張、記者至此、卽起向王師長致愛慕及感謝之意、並擇可宣示國人者、發表如上、且資感召云、</p>

<p>昨日下午四時許、我空軍又出動、向楊樹浦一帶投彈、當卽命中南洋兄弟烟草公司、頓時黑烟西起、火光燭天、因敵軍曾在該廠駐兵、內貯各種軍火甚多、一時爆炸之聲、隨之而起、深晚猶未熄滅、下午五時餘、我空軍一隊、翱翔於浦江之天空、停泊江面之敵艦、卽用高射跑射擊、但我空軍用俯仰之姿態、自空掠下、向敵艦及浦東日華紗廠投下數彈、日華紗廠亦立卽着火、濃密黑烟、騰空而上、江中數艦、亦倉皇失措、慌亂萬分、頓時天地為之變色、而我空軍、則已從容凱旋矣、</p>

<p>浦東洋涇區之日華紗廠、昨晨再度着彈起火、延燒甚烈、據浦東來滬者談、該廠現幾全部焚燬、僅剩牆壁而已、該處秩序平靜、市面亦漸見恢復、按浦東陸家嘴日華紗廠、共有新老廠兩部、佔地百餘畝、老廠位於春江路邊、開設迄今、已有三十餘年之歷史、為日商存滬各紗廠之鼻祖、歷年因營業發達、去歲復在浦邊興建新廠、設置最新式機車、每十六部車、僅須女工一人看守、出品迅速、為壓倒華商紗廠之大本營、自日軍興起滬戰後、該廠內竟暗伏日兵七八十名、詎十七晚當敵艦與我軍砲戰激烈時、廠內日兵、雜以便衣隊、由一二漢奸引導、竟出廠向我三萬昌地方進攻、防守該處者、奮勇抵禦、交鋒半小時後、我援軍馳至、而該廠老廠緯布間、亦中砲彈着火、日軍倉惶敗退、我方乘勝攻入、日軍紛至浦邊、搭小汽船逃逸、火勢經延燒一日夜後、織布間全燬、至昨晨七時許、當我大隊飛機轟炸日艦時、其老廠細妙間又中彈燃燒、火勢猛烈、焚至午後三時、始漸熄滅、至此老廠全部、已付之一炬、詎至昨晚五時三刻、我方飛機再行轟炸日艦時、該廠僅在之新廠部份、第三次中彈燃燒、一時黑烟蔽天、立在租界外灘、卽可望见火燄、燃燒之烈、較老廠尤甚、直至午夜未熄、經此三度大火後、該廠全部已化為灰爐矣、</p>

<h3>張治中接見外國記者</h3>
<p>談戰事殊為幽默　我發動全面抗戰</p>
<p>中央社云、路透、哈瓦斯·美聯·塔斯等四外國通訊社、及中央社記者共五人、昨日由京滬警備司令部駐滬代表湯武·陪同往謁京滬警備司令張治中氏、張氏於戎馬倥惚之中接見晤談、對於各記者所提出之問題、答復頗為詳盡、茲特分紀如下、</p>
<p>日軍不久卽可解决</p>
<p>張氏首對各記者之遠道往訪、致慰勉之意、嗣卽允記者之請、說明目前之戰况、據張氏談、我軍昨晚（十九日）已進展至匯山碼頭、將日軍全綫切成兩段、全滬日軍已被我軍包圍、正如甕中之鱉、不久當可完全解决、我軍於一週內傷亡之確數、目前尚無精密之統計、惟本人所敢確信而為諸君吉者、日軍傷亡之數目、當倍於我軍、至於目前在虹口及楊樹浦一帶作戰之日軍、約計一萬二千至一萬五千人、至此有一記者詢以日方所傳中國飛機已被日方擊落八十餘架之說確否、張氏微笑而以幽默之口吻答曰、余為中國人、殊不善作虛偽之宣傳也、在座者聞言、均憶及連日日方所發表虛偽之情報、亦相與作會心的微笑、</p>
<p>保護外僑生命財產</p>
<p>張氏繼謂、對於保護外僑之生命及財產、必當盡力、此非僅為絛約上之義務、亦為道義者所必需也、此次僑滬各國婦儒之撤退、以一般之情勢而論、似非必要、惟中日空軍作戰時、因人力所不可挽救之意外、致略有損害、此則又當別論矣、中國外交部此次通知各國兵艦及商輪、須於十二小時之內、遠離日艦停泊地點五海里之外、或使日艦遠離各國兵艦及商輪停泊地點五海里之外、本人僅見諸報載、然本人深信中國此舉、乃屬好意、且為各國之利益與安全計也、至於日軍如若敗退至蘇州河以南、租界內之軍隊反萬國商團、自應解除其武裝、是時有一記者發問、如若日軍敗退至蘇州河以南、而租界內之軍隊及萬國商團並不解除其武裝、則中國軍隊將作如何之處置、張氏答以此乃外交上之問題、屆時當向政府當局請示、但中國决非日本、中國對於國際條約向來尊重也、</p>
<p>最後勝利必屬於我</p>
<p>張氏續謂、中國現已發動全面之抗戰、作戰之時間愈長、則於找愈有利、是故中日全面戰爭時期、將至何日結束、目前殊難預料、戰事或須延長至三年五年以至十年、甚至中國許多領士、或許被日本佔據，然我人深信、最後之勝利、必將屬於中國也、自甲午之戰以迄於今、中國對於日本從未有全國一致之抗戰、此次上海與南口兩戰、可謂中日兩國正式之交鋒、然中國對日是否將正式宣戰、此項中國最高當局所决定、本人份屬軍人、未便答復、自一二八淞滬戰爭之後、我人深覺日軍未必優哀華軍、華軍亦未必弱於日軍、而實際上中國軍隊作戰之能力、且有過於日軍也、一二八滬戰結束之後、我人亦未發現日軍新的武器、日軍所用之武器、絕未出於我人意料之外也、最後記者詢以日軍如巷戰使用毒氣、中國將作何報復、張氏答以中國對於日軍之使用毒氣、已有準備、張氏反以詰問之語體謂本人對於外交及國際公法、均下熟悉、日軍如使用毒氣、其有背於國際公法科、張氏言畢、以目注視在座諸人、各記者對於張氏言詞之犀利、反態度之溫和、均深欽佩、至此乃與辭而退、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>勝利的把握在我們手中</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>上海的戰局展開以來到現在已滿一週了。這一週來戰局的發展。顯示出我方以聲齊的軍容。精利的武器。堅决的鬥志。已給與日帝國主義以迎頭的痛擊。現在事實告訴我們。戰爭範圍的擴大。戰爭時間的延長。對於我們絕無問題、而對於日方則絕對不利。這次戰爭中最後勝利的把握。已完全在我們手中。</p>
<p>戰爭不是可以隨意幻想的事情。也不是可以當作兒戲的事情。以前我國有一部分人。對抗戰抱着無端的顧慮。以前日本軍閥認為對華侵略可以隨心所欲。現在我們的抗戰一經發動。立刻證明那種幻想與兒戲。是完全的錯誤。一星期來戰爭的經驗。給我們看到了幾個重要的事實。第一。國際的同情。現在完全是在我們方面。第二。日本的軍隊與武器。並不比我們高强。第三。我方全國一致。齊心抗戰。而日方則人民痛恨軍閥。反對侵略。已顯露很大的政治社會機構上的裂痕。</p>
<p>上述這三點。乃是保蹬我們勝利的最重要的因素。現在我們可以把它們分別考察一下。</p>
<p>在蘆溝橋事件發生之初。國際間的形勢。似乎並不利於我們的全面抗戰。英國不願遠東局勢的嚴重化。美國在考慮着中立法的問題。蘇聯則對內在聲飭軍紀對外抱着謹愼應付的態度但是我們在上海的抗戰一經發動國際間的注意立刻轉移到東方。英·美·法·蘇·的報紙一致抨擊日帝國主義的殘暴侵略行為。最顯明的是英國半官式的泰晤士報。也改變了一向對日妥恊的論調。指斥日本軍閥的侵害中國主權。倫敦當局顯然感覺到英國在東方的利益。已受到日本侵略行動的威脅了。美國勢力從中國撤退的消息。現在還是日方的宣傳居多而實際的可能較少事實上我們相信美國與蘇聯所能給與我國精神上以至物質上的幫助。必將大過於一切。這是日帝國主義所無法取得的。</p>
<p>在軍事方面。這次戰事一經爆發。我方的空軍立刻發揮了無上的威力。我們以攻勞代替了過去的守勢。我們的飛機與重砲。使日軍不能越雷池一步。事實上。這次日軍在上海作戰的主力。只是停泊在江中的砲艦。而因為我軍的奮勇進攻。敵軍後援無法登陸。岸上的陣地也漸見縮小。敵人以飛機重砲亂轟。徒見其戰鬥力之窮蹙而已。在另一方面。自北而南。由察邊至沿海一帶。我軍無不在準備戰鬥。敵人到處亂撞。軍力益見分散。其不能持久作戰。乃是必然的結果。</p>
<p>至於在全國的戰鬥意志上。一星期來的經騐。我方更是遠過於敵人。我們全國的軍力民力現在已不分彼此團結一致務必將日帝國主義在我國土上的勢力。全部掃蕩而後已但在日方國內則據最近歸國之僑胞所云。政黨財閥。雖㒤於軍閥之淫威。不敢公然反對戰爭。而中小商人的感受經濟壓迫。家庭婦女的不忍男子來華送死。已引起逃避兵役。痛惜分離等愁慘不安的景象。就是日方在華的工商業。者也恐懼此次戰爭所加於他們的損。失有着憎嫌其國內野心軍閥的表示。我方正以决死的意志。發動全國的抗戰。而日方則已人心騷動。社會不安。這種基本國力上的比較。更顯示最後勝利的把握。已全在我們的手中。</p>

<h3>陶百川講前線勞軍經過</h3>
<p>人人抱必死之心　方殺出一條生路</p>
<p>本市抗敵後援會委員陶百川、近往前綫勞軍、昨在中西電台廣播演說、“從前綫帶來的好消息”、茲撮錄其詞如下、十八日晨六時、我和潘公展·吳開先·汪曼雲·君一行四人、駛往前敵、代表市黨部去勞軍、車過眞如、遙見東南學院員生所編的救護隊、攔住去路、說敵機在五時半往炸東南、投彈十餘、重傷四人、校舍全燬、他們要求把一位輕傷的醫生和大批藥品帶往某處、並囑給某處報信、速派救護車前去救傷、我們一一照辦、到了某處、通過四個機關、見過五位職員、方才找到張司令文伯的辦公處、張司令告訴吾們、六日來作戰的大略情形、他說、我軍犧牲精神、遠勝於敵軍、而敵軍傷亡人數、反多於我軍約二倍半至三倍以上、此之謂投諸死地而後生、人人抱必死之心、所以方能殺出一條生路、張司令對戰事前途、非常樂觀、他說、日本無論來多少援軍、絕無制勝的可能、但因虹口楊樹浦一帶工事堅固、進攻需相當時間、並須拚極大的犧牲、因為日本在一二八以後、已經把虹口楊樹浦一帶築成要塞一樣的堅固了關於浦東方面、張司令說、我軍有火力極强的大砲、堪與射程二十五公里的日軍大砲一拚、所以亦無問題、關於瀏河到江陰一帶的防務、張司令說、我們極願和敵軍在瀏河等處作戰、因為敵人在那邊沒有砲兵陣地坦克車又不能登陸、海軍大砲又因敵軍上陸、不好隨便濫轟、而且地們對於地利又沒有象虹口一樣的熟悉、我軍以逸待勞、定可鼓而殲、我們說、上海市民極願動員人力物力、、以為抗敵將士作後援、但多不知應該如何努力、我們接着列舉幾個問題、請張司令指敎、他說、人員與物質、政府本來都有相當準備、但因戰事擴大與延長、自然需要各方補助、現在最需要者為蔴袋、因為官兵無論前進或後退、都要帶着蔴袋、以便隨時裝成砂袋、其次為運輸器材、如汽車·汽油·機器腳踏車·和自由車（腳踏東）等、再次為通訊器材、如電話電綫等、至於人力、張司令說、暫時還不十分需要、人民如能在生產本位上努力工作、也可説是參加了戰事、張司令並説、司令部方面、有一個後方人民戰事服務辦法、可以參考、我們還說到了如何疏通上海居民的問題、張司令說、他已接到我們的電報、他希望在不妨碍軍事的條件下、從速恢復上海和內地的交通、他已交參謀處研究一個兩全的方法、不久就可决定、我們和張司令談了三四十分鐘、就辭別張司令去見楊司令和童參謀長、他們也告訴我們許多戰事的消息、我們在分別時、彼此都有依依不捨的樣子、楊司令亞叮囑我們要留心飛機擲彈、歸途中果然遇見了雨架敵機、我們一連三次下車、避入樹下、幸免於難回到上海、知道方才追逐我們的飛機、曾經放槍擊傷後援會慰勞車上一個童子軍、各位知道、我們的慰勞車是毫無抵抗的、所以敵機飛得很低、投彈之外、還放機關槍、然而僅能轟傷我們一人、足見敵機也没有人們想像那樣可怕了、</p>

<h3>我軍猛攻敵頑抗滬東區大火將成焦土</h3>
<p>敵機到處擲炸彈都未命中　江灣路越過敵司令部以南</p>
<p>（本報特訊）據確報、敵軍陣地、被我切成兩段後、我江灣路靑雲路方面、卽奉令前進、惟自昨晨至傍晚之間、因在白晝、又以敵機頻來肆虐、未能盡量挺進、迨昨晚七時後、遂分路同時向敵軍司令部襲擊、我軍以大批迫擊砲、集中火力、掩護步兵進搏一聲號令、個個奮勇直前、敵軍倉皇應戰、浴血惡鬥多時　　敵軍死傷枕籍、我亦不無損失、至十二時許、敵軍不支、紛紛向南潰退、我遂乘勝追擊、當到達司令部北面墙脚時、又復相持多時、至今晨一時許、始在殺聲雲天之中、繞越敵軍堅壘鐵壁之司令部、且向南挺進一百餘米突、敵軍密結隊、退至北四川路底以南、横浜橋以北一帶、前綫僅有少數部隊、仍在頑强抵抗、但敵膽已寒　　整個陣綫、已岌岌搖動矣、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）自我軍佔領敵人登陸根據地之匯山碼頭、將其全綫切段後、敵恐慌萬狀、但猶作困獸之鬭、冀挽回危局於萬一、昨晚敵集中坦克車及鋼甲車多輛、向已失陣地、猛烈衝鋒、我軍亦集中砲火、並用極猛烈之爆炸物、迎頭痛擊、直鏖戰至深夜、敵毫無進展而退、遺棄屍身、縱橫滿地、並據昨晚在八字橋前綫被捕之間諜供稱、敵電自失守匯山碼頭後、軍心確異常慌亂、一種狼狽失措情形、隨處可以看到、</p>
<h3>匯山碼頭困獸猶鬥</h3>
<p>惡戰達二十餘小時　楊樹浦我用火圍攻</p>
<p>（本報特訊）我軍奪進敵方腹部、佔據匯山碼頭、一面搆築陣地、一面分途攻擊敵軍、西面敵軍亦以大批鐵甲戰車、對我陣地猛烈反攻、冀作困獸之鬥、自前晚起至今晨止、雙方浴血惡戰、竟達二十餘小時之久、尤以昨晚更為激烈、敵軍死傷遍地、我方亦有相當損傷、又楊樹浦方面、敵軍多數躲入市屋內作戰、昨晚已被我軍用火圍攻、故晚火光燭天、至今午尚未熄滅、</p>
<p>中央社云、我軍自佔領匯山碼頭一帶陣地之後、卽行構築堅固之防禦工事、後方部隊、亦已陸續進駐、兵力頗為雄厚、敵軍自昨晚以迄今晨拂曉、數度向我猛烈反攻、均經我軍擊退、敵軍傷亡甚多云、</p>
<h3>敵軍陣地窮蹙縮小</h3>
<p>我軍事機關得報、敵軍因原有三十餘里之陣地、現已被我包圍逼迫、縮至僅十五里以內、範圍極小、且又被我切成兩截、而浦江艦隊、更在重重圍攻之中、勢難立足、雖有大批援軍開到口外、復以我方沿江軍力雄厚、無法登陸、浦東方面、亦無發展餘地、據我軍事長官昨對本報記者稱、目前敵人處勢雖壞、彼輩决不甘心、不久必傾全力來犯、我方準備充足、與敵抗戰到底、决不絲毫放棄、</p>
<h3>我軍進攻敵司令部經過</h3>
<p>（本報特訊）今日上午五時許、本報記者晤及方於今晨拂曉時自江灣路負傷歸來之士兵劉林生、據述昨晚我軍進攻江灣路日軍司令部經過甚詳、茲誌其听述情形如下、</p>
<p>江灣路敵軍司令部、自開戰後、卽遭我軍砲火及空軍所破壞、惟該處牆壁、係用三層厚鋼板建築、故驟視之下、外貎尚屬完整、而不知內部確已凌亂殘毀不堪矣、同時內部尚建有地窖、似與鄰近敵軍主力能通達者、因此該司令部雖經我軍四面包圍後、其殘餘部隊、仍不時在白晝出現、向我射擊、但未幾又寂然、蓋又已遁入墻內矣、我軍知其狡點、决不理睬、仍重重包圍、思以一鼓擒之、昨晚（二十日）八時、我駐守江灣路愛國女校·粵東中學·持志大學·等處之軍隊、奉令向司令部圍攻、並以搗破敵巢為目的、當時我大隊迫擊砲及童砲隊、卽出動掩護、號角一聲、槍砲齊發、我軍精神奮勇、莫不爭先、以極敏捷之戰法、直撲敵巢、當時日軍措手不及、大起慌亂、經敵兵官以武力鎮壓、始勉强應戰、經我砲火重重壓迫、敵漸不支、但其後援已到、於是激戰重行開始、我軍奮不顧身、同以手溜彈白刃與敵相搏、一時彈如雨點、血肉橫飛、我軍喊殺之聲、震澈雲霄、敵兵屢進屢退者數次、激戰達二小時餘、至午夜十二時許、敵兵傷亡枕藉、血流成渠、終以不支、全部退出司令部、經北四川路狄思威路向南潰退、而我（劉自稱）亦卽於斯時掛彩、受傷惟神智仍清、曾目睹我軍隊推進、已超過敵司令部東約一百餘米突、嗣後進展情形、因我已昏迷、未克備告、惟現悉該處地帶、已由我築有堅固陣地云、但此外尚有一事足述者、卽前兩日、我等奉令向江灣路進攻、佔據愛國女學·粵東中學·持志大學·一帶日軍陣地時、當時愛國女學內、有日兵十餘名、因四週已被我軍包圍、不及逃出當被我軍將其繳械俘獲、押送後方、予以看禁云、全此記者以所談甚多、惟恐劉君疲乏、遂向其道謝、祝其旱復康健而出、</p>
<p>滬東區成巨大火山</p>
<p>楊樹浦路及虹口一帶敵軍陣地、先後被我空軍及巨砲擊中、卽着火燃燒、火勢猛烈、至今晨五時許、火勢稍殺、旋於十時計、復有多處中砲起火、據由新記浜路逃出之難民語新新社記者、新記浜路·兆豐路·鄧脫路·塘山路·東有恒路·公平路·茂海路·昆明路·一帶房屋、均被大火包圍、燃燃中、尤以百老匯路及莊源大·元芳路·裏虹橋·火勢為最烈、記者今午在自來水橋遙望東區、祗見烈燄飛騰、濃烟蔽天、形成一座巨大火山、其火勢之猛烈、實為空前未有、</p>
<p>昨晨起、虹口文監師路·武昌路及公平路等數處、均起火延燒、濃烟遮日、火焰沖天、至發稿時尚在延燒、</p>
<p>公共租界工部局情報室訊、二十日下午七時、匯山區內、北至西華德路、南至百老匯路、東至鄧脫路、西至華記路、各處火勢熊熊、八時十分華德路監獄東面及北站以東、約兩英里處均有大火、十時浦江中、日本軍艦三艘、向浦東開砲、</p>
<p>二十一日晨八時、東北風頗烈、下列各處均起火、㊀周家嘴煤油碼頭附近、㊁百老匯路南洋烟草公司西鄰、㊂華記路、㊃漢𤩹禮路、梧州路口、八時二十二分華德路監獄以東約四分之一英里處亦有大火、九時半百老匯路公平路口亦起火、</p>
<p>殘敵退東百老匯路</p>
<p>我軍昨日在匯由碼頭集中兵力、布置各邊項防禦工事後、卽由公平路·鄧脫路·茂海路·新陣地·聯絡華德路·昆明路·曹由路·各綫、向東西兩面發展、昨晚新記浜路·元芳路·華記路·曾有激烈巷戰、迄今晨我軍已挺進至元芳路華德路交叉點、並由華德路西迄至裏虹橋附近、該橋交通、已為我軍控制、該處殘敵、完全退據於東百老滙路、週園六七百米突之區域內、已無戰鬥能力、惟懾於上級官佐之威力、尚勉强困守云、</p>
<p>潰退敵軍俘獲十餘</p>
<p>（本報特訊）前幾日我軍猛攻水電路江灣路一帶、佔領愛國女學及持志學院、當時砲火激烈、敵軍倉皇應戰、狼狽不堪、死傷無算、潰不成軍、急急惶惶、如𣼣網之魚、紛紛向後方竄逃、當有敵軍十餘名、不及逃退、被我軍俘獲、解除武裝、茲悉該俘虜業已押解後方、廳候發落云、</p>
<p>敵砲濫擊我緝私艦</p>
<p>昨晚我空軍襲攻敵艦後、敵艦為放大砲、有一彈十六舖之金利源碼頭棧房屋頂轟去、又有一彈、對我停泊在十六舖金利源碼頭前之緝么巡艦一艘、攔腰擊中一洞、艦內卽行浸水、當由艦中水手人等搶救、今晨已在修理中矣、</p>
<h3>今晨我空軍轟炸</h3>
<p>一彈中茂昌冷汽廠　百老匯路一帶大火</p>
<p>（本報特訊）今晨我空軍再度至浦江轟炸日艦、及沿江之建築物、以利軍事動作、在八時許、有轟炸機三架、先在高空盤旋多時、敵艦高射砲齊嗚、我機在砲彈聲中、旋飛而下、連投兩彈、中茂昌冷氣廠、一中招商局北棧後面某屋、霎時火光燭天、燃燒甚烈、敵軍亦派水上飛機四架、起而與我空軍作戰、四敵機包圍我一機、雙方各開機槍、今晨我空軍飛機六架、仍繼續在楊樹浦路東百老匯路一帶之敵軍最後根據地投彈轟炸、當有順泰碼頭及南洋公司附近房屋起火、洽燒甚烈、迄午尚濃烟蔽空、據華記路逃出者稱、東百老匯路一帶屋、大部焚燬、至負嵎敵軍、無藏身之處、恐慌萬分、</p>
<p>中央社云、我軍連日在東西兩路乘勝進迫、敵陣地日蹙、已分為三段、密集於百老匯路及楊樹浦底等處、我軍仍利用空軍轟炸、以冀一舉而殲滅之、今晨六時廿分、我機兩架、由西而東、出現於虹口敵軍陣地、繞空數匝、在敵艦高射砲中、從容擲下數彈、均能命中、有數處着彈起火、兩機卽向東飛去、至九時許、我機一架又出現於空中敵艦尚未察覺、該機卽疾駛而下、在招商局中棧後投下數彈、迨敵艦嗚驚發砲、我機已騰空而去、當時在浦濱之中外人士、目賭此活躍之表演、均贊譽不止云、</p>
<h3>出雲艦又向東移</h3>
<p>（本報特訊）敵旗艦出雲號、自被我爆炸後、近數日中、日夜移泊無常、今晨該艦先由陸家嘴北、二三號浮筒、移至浦江中流、掉轉艦身（本來頭向西者、今艦首向東矣、至十一時零八分、該艦忽開車東駛、但因尾葉損壞、不能行動、駛航時甚緩、幾若蚌步、迨開至鄧脫路段江面、又不能駛動、白渡橋花園前、已開到敵一號魚雷艦一艘拋停、</p>

<p>閘北南市擊落敵機</p>
<p>今晨七時左右、閘北各處又來敵機多架、高翔雲霄、有一機在中山路談家橋附近上空、適遇我飛機兩架、由西面來、當卽發生空中激戰、彼此盤旋數匝、而該敵機作東逃狀、旋卽返身用機關槍射擊、我機亦用機槍回擊、一時軋軋之聲、遐邇咸聞、約戰十餘分鐘、各向東西飛去、至八時二十五分時、又來日本轟炸機三架、被我用高射砲轟擊、砰訇之聲、密如聯珠、敵機遂恐慌逸去、</p>

<p>昨二十日敵機在南市投彈時、被我防軍用機槍擊中一機、因受損頗重、被迫在斜橋附近之日暉港南岸跌落、司機急欲圖逃、當被忠勇兵士瞥見、遂卽捕獲、連同跌損飛機押解而去、</p>
<p>浦東南北市現敵機</p>
<p>中央社云、敵機連日出動、目的在偵察我軍陣地、並破壞我交通工具及一切設備等、惟以我防衛嚴密、敵機不敢冒險低飛、故雖投彈、於我無多損失、今晨敵機多架、又分在浦東南市閘北等地投彈云、</p>

<p>［東京］日首相近衛文　、今日向此間報界代表發表宣言、申稱日本政府决定以武力解决中日衝突、不容任何第三者之干涉、近衛力言、中日問題只能由中日兩國自行解决、至日本目的、乃剷除華北一切“反日”份子及共產勢力、在日本密切合作之下、治理華北云云、此項宣言、證明英國調解計劃已歸失敗、（二十日海通電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英國政府提議中日兩國軍隊各自上海附近撤退、以更劃出中立區域一事、日本外務省當局頃已表示拒不接受、此間日本人士頃加以解釋、謂該國外務省所作表示、應視為切實拒絕英國提議、此項提議若在上星期中提出、日本政府或可加以接受、但時至今日、則已無接受餘地云、（中央社二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

        <h1>1937.08.21</h1>
<h3>The Enemy Launches Two Counterattacks on Wayside Wharf</h3>
<p>Our troops fought valiantly, repelling them each time. The remaining enemy shows signs of complete collapse. Several artillery battles broke out in the Pudong area.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) Confirmed reports state that since our troops occupied Wayside Wharf the night before last, completely severing the enemy's entire line, the enemy launched a full-scale counterattack around 4:00 PM yesterday, charging fiercely with armored cars and tanks several times, hoping to recapture it. Our troops resisted bravely, and the battle was fierce, but the enemy ultimately failed. At 9:00 PM last night, the enemy launched a second counterattack. Our troops responded with machine gun fire and small mortar barrages. The fighting was even more intense than before. At one point, our troops were in a difficult situation, but reinforcements arrived shortly after, boosting our morale. The sound of machine guns and mortars was constant. Our troops bravely advanced, and by 1:00 AM this morning, they had repelled the enemy. The enemy on the Eight Character Bridge front, after our occupation of Wayside Wharf, are in a state of panic and disarray, and their retreat is inevitable.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) Our artillery units and enemy warships in the Huangpu River exchanged fire several times yesterday. Around 4:00 PM, the sound of artillery suddenly erupted, but stopped after only a few shots. At 6:30 PM, there was another continuous barrage of artillery fire, which was more intense than before, lasting for about ten minutes. Then, at 10:00 PM in the evening, the artillery battle was at its most intense, with continuous booming sounds mixed with machine gun fire, which only stopped after half an hour.</p>
<p>According to confirmed reports, after our troops occupied Wayside Wharf, the enemy troops from Tangshan Road to Dilan Bridge were attacked from the northwest on both sides and had no defenses to hold. They retreated in disarray yesterday, and our troops have already moved into the area.</p>
<p>The Japanese command headquarters appears to be located between Outer Hongqiao and the northern section of Shaoshan. High-ranking enemy officers frequently enter and exit the area around Outer Hongqiao.</p>
<p>The enemy troops near Hongkou Park launched repeated attacks on us yesterday, attempting to break out of the encirclement, but were repelled by our troops. The enemy suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) In the vicinity of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha wharf in eastern Shanghai, both sides engaged in artillery battles, and the enemy suffered considerable losses. Street fighting broke out in the Jiaxing Road area. Japanese warships in the river also fired on the North Station, and our troops retaliated fiercely. Losses are unknown.</p>
<h3>Enemy Shells Hit U.S. Flagship</h3>
<p>One American soldier was killed instantly. A total of eighteen were injured.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at 6:40 PM last night, Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River shelled the Nanshi and Pudong areas of our city. One shell landed on the deck of the U.S. flagship USS Augusta, which was anchored in front of the Jianghai Customs. One American soldier was killed instantly, and eighteen were injured, five of whom were seriously injured.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the consulates of various countries the day before yesterday afternoon that all warships and merchant ships of various countries in Shanghai must stay at least five nautical miles away from the Japanese warships’ anchorage within twelve hours, or have the Japanese warships stay at least five nautical miles away from the warships and merchant ships of various countries. This notification expired at 3:00 AM yesterday. A reporter personally inspected the Bund yesterday afternoon and saw that the British and American warships were still anchored in their original positions and had not moved. Japanese warships were still outside the Baidu Bridge, about 1,800 meters away from the American warship anchored at the U.S. Navy pontoon off Fuzhou Road.</p>
<p>Investigation of Foreign Warship Anchorage Locations</p>
<p>The anchorage locations of foreign warships yesterday were as follows: There were one American dispatch ship and one small gunboat in the Xinkai River. There were one French cruiser and two battleships off Edward Road. There were two British warships and one dispatch ship at the intersection of Wuma Road. There was one American cruiser at the intersection of Sima Road, for a total of nine ships. As for the enemy warships, they were anchored on the river north of the Waibaidu Bridge.</p>
<p>Five More Japanese Warships Added to Huangpu River</p>
<p>Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River were busy relocating yesterday evening. According to an investigation by a reporter at 10:00 AM today (the 30th), five more Japanese warships sailed into the Huangpu River last night. There are now a total of nineteen Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River. The Japanese naval flagship Izumo is still anchored at the No. 2 pontoon opposite the Gonghexiang Wharf. The ship is protected by three enemy destroyers, one cruiser, and one gunboat anchored in front and behind it. One gunboat is anchored horizontally at the mouth of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek. All heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns are fully equipped, seemingly waiting for our aircraft to attack.</p>
<h3>Our Front Line Reaches Lihong Bridge</h3>
<p>Building strong fortifications in already occupied territories. The enemy has lost its fighting ability and has become a disorganized rabble.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after our troops occupied Wayside Wharf the night before last, cutting off the enemy's left and right wings, they took advantage of the victory to advance on two routes, east and west. The soldiers were full of energy and a hundred times more courageous. The remaining enemy lost all will to fight and were extremely demoralized. Yesterday morning, the left wing collapsed and retreated towards Shuntai Wharf. Our troops built strong fortifications near Kunming Road and Tangshan Road in the occupied territories and pursued the enemy forward. Around 4:00 PM, they advanced along Dongyouheng Road and Donghanbi Road. The front line has reached Lihong Bridge. The Japanese left wing is now completely surrounded by our troops, in a state of chaos, and has lost all combat capability, becoming a disorganized rabble. It is about to be completely resolved.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, military intelligence reports that the troops who rushed to Wayside Wharf the night before last were two regiments of the [illegible] division and one regiment of the [illegible] division. Our troops advanced rapidly, and the battle became even more intense yesterday afternoon. There were still some stubborn elements among the enemy who resisted tenaciously in some dangerous places. However, there were large fires everywhere in the Hongkou area. By 10:00 PM in the evening, the fire had become even more intense, and the remaining enemy was showing signs of complete collapse. They intend to take effective measures to explain to these innocent soldiers, who are forced by the tyrannical power of the brutal warlords, the spirit of our country's generosity and love, and persuade them to surrender from afar, so as to avoid further bloodshed. It is thought that the Shanghai battle can be concluded in the short term.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Fire in Enemy Positions</h3>
<p>Hit by our army's bombing and artillery fire. The intensity of the fire exceeds that of the January 28th Incident.</p>
<p>Starting at 6:00 AM yesterday, enemy positions in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas were successively bombed by our air force and hit by heavy artillery. Three or four places caught fire and spread. The fire was very intense. Then, at noon, more fires broke out in the Hongkou area. Flames soared high, and black smoke covered the sky. A huge smokescreen formed from Yuanfang Road to Yangshupu, reaching the clouds above and facing the Huangpu River below. The intensity of the fire was even greater than the fire in Zhabei during the January 28th Incident. It was truly unprecedented in Shanghai. By evening, our air force returned to Shanghai for another bombing raid. Bullets hit and started fires at the western end of Wusong Road and Broadway Road, and the fire spread rapidly. At the same time, the factory buildings of the Japanese-owned China Cotton Mill in Pudong also caught fire and spread three times. Looking eastward at night, one could only see the fire illuminating the sky, as bright as day. As of the time of writing, the fires were still burning. The enemy troops in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas were using civilian houses as defenses, attempting a final struggle. After this great fire, the enemy troops were in a state of panic and disarray, and the day of their annihilation is not far off.</p>
<p>According to the Shin Shih News Agency, dozens of civilian houses in the eastern Shanghai area caught fire from shells yesterday. By the afternoon, the burning became more intense and spread further. In areas such as Hongkou Zhuangyuan and Yuanfang Road, two or three hundred civilian houses had been destroyed. The most intense fire was in the area behind the Nanyang Tobacco Company on Broadway Road, from Xinji Bang Road to Zhaofeng Road, Tangshan Road, Dongyouheng Road, Dengtuo Road, Gongping Road, and Maohai Road, and Kunming Road. More than four thousand civilian houses in this area were destroyed by artillery fire yesterday, and the fire spread rapidly. From the Bund, one could see smoke billowing, half the sky red.</p>
<h3>British Troops Strictly Guard Against Fleeing Enemy Soldiers</h3>
<p>Special martial law declared along the Bund. American warships in the Huangpu River fly red flags as a warning.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) Since our troops occupied Wayside Wharf the night before last, they continued to advance forward yesterday morning. The enemy troops collapsed in disarray, and the battle lines became smaller and smaller, so that the situation in the Waibaidu Bridge area suddenly became serious. In order to avoid accidents and prevent the Japanese army from fleeing south across the Waibaidu Bridge, the authorities of the International Settlement specially ordered a temporary curfew to be declared in the Bund area from 12:00 noon yesterday, cutting off traffic. The area from Waibaidu Bridge to the Bund of Edward Road, and from the Sichuan Road Bridge to the east of Beijing Road, was closed to pedestrians and vehicles. On the one hand, British and American armed forces and the International Settlement Volunteers were dispatched to tighten security in the area. The situation was very tense. After hearing the news, a reporter from this newspaper drove to the Bund area at 3:30 PM to investigate. When he turned east from Edward Road towards Huangpu Beach Road, he was stopped by five or six police officers and a British soldier who were preventing passage. The reporter immediately explained his purpose and showed his press pass, and was then allowed to pass. There were dozens of workers carrying sandbags to prepare for defensive works. The area north of here, which used to be crowded with traffic and pedestrians, was now suddenly deserted. Only three or five police officers and armed British soldiers were seen patrolling back and forth. Warships from Britain, the United States, France, and Italy stood tall in the middle of the river, flying red flags as a warning. The gunports were all pointed towards the Hongkou area. At the intersection of Nanjing Road, British soldiers and workers were busy stacking sandbags. In front of the Bund Park, sandbags were piled up, forming bunkers. The glass windows of the British Bank on Beijing Road were all nailed shut with thick wooden boards. The Waibaidu Bridge and the Suzhou Creek area were deserted. The British soldiers guarding the center of the bridge were very strict. The Chinese police at the Beijing Road intersection tried their best to stop the reporter from going any further to the bridgehead to avoid danger, because the enemy troops across the river would open fire as soon as they saw Chinese people. Even they (the Chinese police) could not get close to the bridgehead. While the reporter was wandering around, he suddenly heard the sound of an airplane overhead, circling over the roof of the Japanese Consulate north of the Waibaidu Bridge, knowing that our air force was flying to bomb it. At the same time, two anti-aircraft guns were fired from the roof of a certain building. At this point, the reporter drove back.</p>
<p>Enemy Disarmed and Taken into Custody</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) It was heard that around 3:00 PM yesterday, defeated enemy soldiers from the front line fled to the Waibaidu Bridge and asked the British troops stationed there for help. They were disarmed by the British soldiers, put into police cars, and taken to a certain place. The reporter went to the Bund area at 3:30 PM to investigate. When asked, passersby in front of the British Bank on Beijing Road replied that this was indeed the case. About a hundred enemy soldiers were disarmed by the troops stationed at the Waibaidu Bridge, leaving only their shirts, and were loaded into three cars and taken to the police station. Later, inquiries were made to the police station, which denied this. However, according to other sources, about a hundred enemy soldiers were indeed disarmed by the police station and escorted by British soldiers to the British Military Headquarters at the Racecourse for custody. Also, at around 5:00 PM, more than a dozen fleeing soldiers at the intersection of Bazilu and North Henan Road were disarmed and escorted to the British Military Headquarters at the Racecourse.</p>
<h3>British Donate Supplies to Comfort the Wounded</h3>
<p>A letter describes the Japanese army's atrocities and their inevitable collapse. Justice is in the hearts of the people; our compatriots should strive.</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, a famous British writer, Mr. May, wrote to the Continental News on the 19th, asking the newspaper's reporter to forward a silver coin container and a silver cigarette case given to him by his mother to the Chinese Wounded Soldiers Hospital. Mr. May left Shanghai on the 20th, saying that because he had no cash, he specially donated these two beloved silverware items to express his meager support for China. The two items have been sent to Mayor Yu by the Continental News, and Mayor Yu has replied with thanks, saying that he will report this matter to the National Government. Mr. May's letter stated, in brief, that because he is British, he cannot donate to China's war expenses, but he cannot help but offer some assistance to the Chinese soldiers who have been injured while bravely resisting the invading army, in order to show his respect. The invading country has forcibly occupied the international neutral territory from Yangshupu to Suzhou Creek with its army, and sent cruisers and destroyers to the center of the Huangpu River, using the neutral territory it has destroyed itself as cover, causing extreme danger to the innocent residents and starving refugees of the Public Concession. He has personally witnessed the Japanese propaganda and provocative acts in Shanghai, which have caused great difficulties for commerce and refugees. China is not responsible for any of this. He has also witnessed Japanese soldiers in Hongkou forcibly seizing British-owned trucks and other means of transportation with guns, and Japanese sailors stabbing a Chinese woman with bayonets. All of this is caused by the ambition of warlords who have nothing to do with civilization and morality. These warlords are clearly trying to eliminate the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in China. China has more friends in the world than it knows. These friends all want China to fight and ask Chairman Chiang to continue to send large armies to expand the war on all fronts in order to resist the invaders and persevere to the end, and not to negotiate peace, because he knows that the Japanese will inevitably collapse behind the lines, and that Japan's own finances and economy will eventually collapse. Then China can drive the Japanese warlords out of North China, Manchuria, and the entire mainland, and peacefully carry out its construction projects, and get along well with the Japanese civilians, because the Japanese civilians do not want war, just like the Chinese people. Justice is in the hearts of the people. Seeing Mr. May's letter, we are even more convinced of this.</p>
<p>Enemy Occupies New Asia Hotel to Erect Anti-Aircraft Guns</p>
<p>According to the Shin Shih News Agency, around 3:00 PM yesterday, the Japanese army suddenly occupied the New Asia Hotel at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Tiantong Road, and erected anti-aircraft guns and air defense signals on the roof of the building. As soon as a Chinese plane approached, there was a fierce roar from that location, warning their troops to fire on us with anti-aircraft guns. The New Asia Hotel has been completely evacuated since the outbreak of the Shanghai war on the 13th, and the doors have been closed. The British flag is also hung on the roof, as the hotel is registered with the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>Enemy Sweeps Ferry Boats with Machine Guns</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the eastern district of the city's concession is being used by the enemy for combat. The area was originally a factory area with a dense population. Since the enemy has been retreating step by step, the residents of various countries in the area have successively fled. Before yesterday, people still relied on ferries to enter and exit the various public docks, fleeing the dangerous area. The situation has changed drastically since yesterday morning. After the enemy troops were driven back in disarray, they built defensive works all along Broadway Road, and from time to time swept the boats back and forth with machine guns, and small ferries could no longer go there. It is reported that a few residents are still left in that area.</p>
<p>Enemy Corpses Floating on the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>According to the Shin Shih News Agency, several enemy corpses were found in the Suzhou Creek around 9:00 AM yesterday. Because the tide in the Huangpu River was rising, they all floated into the Suzhou Creek and went west. The corpses were still wearing gray steel helmets on their heads, presumably Japanese soldiers who tried to attack our Pudong yesterday, and were swept away by our army and drowned.</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, a person who escaped from Zhaofeng Road yesterday said that after our troops occupied Wayside Wharf the night before last, the enemy was extremely panicked because contact with the eastern district was cut off. Overnight, they transported a large number of military supplies ashore from enemy ships docked at Gonghexiang Pier, and chose taller buildings along Zhaofeng Road and Broadway Road to set up anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, and small mortars. Sandbags and barbed wire were set up at the intersection with Huade Road. The situation was very panicky. Our army's positions could be vaguely seen from the top of the three-story building.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Retreat to North Henan Road</p>
<p>The area of North Henan Road north of the Suzhou Creek was originally defended by the International Settlement Volunteers, but since yesterday, it has been occupied by Japanese soldiers. Japanese soldiers have also set up small mortars and machine guns in the small vegetable market in the area. The reporter went to the area yesterday morning and saw that traffic was still open, but Japanese soldiers were not allowed to look up and look around. The reporter witnessed five Chinese people being shot dead by Japanese soldiers for looking up and looking around. According to a report from the Hongkou police station, martial law has been declared in the area yesterday, and armored cars are being driven back and forth on patrol. After 1:00 PM, artillery battles broke out on the eastern section of Bazilu, and then stopped.</p>
<p>Our Side Inspects and Detains Japanese Ships</p>
<p>Six merchant ships of the Japanese Qing Company anchored at Shiliupu and South Huangpu were reportedly carrying military supplies to supply enemy ships and were detained by us. Except for two that have already sunk, we sent personnel to inspect the remaining four. In one ship, the hold was completely filled with large bags of sulfur, which shows their intention.</p>
<p>Japanese Concealment Is Futile</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, a spokesman for the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai denied the claim yesterday morning that Japanese ground forces had arrived in Shanghai to participate in the war, saying that all those fighting in Shanghai were naval landing forces. He also claimed that Japanese soldiers had not landed in Pudong. As of noon on August 17, the number of Japanese officers and soldiers killed was less than thirty, and the number of wounded was about sixty. The spokesman admitted that the Japanese army in the eastern district was in a difficult situation on the night of August 17, saying that this was partly due to the withdrawal of the Public Concession police from the area. Now, some police officers have returned to the area and patrol the streets from sunrise to sunset, and most of them are Japanese (Translator's Note: Tokyo telegraph reported that the Japanese regular army had opened fire on Shanghai, and after several days of fighting, it was claimed that fewer than thirty people had died and about sixty people had been wounded. It is truly embarrassing for the spokesman to say this, so the North China Daily News added question marks above "less than thirty people" and "about sixty people." As for the difficult situation of the Japanese army on the night of the 17th, claiming that it was caused by the police's evacuation from the eastern district, it is also nonsense. From this, it can be proved that there is no credible word in the mouths of the Japanese.)</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Drop Bombs on North Bridge and Minhang</h3>
<p>At 7:00 AM this morning, three enemy planes suddenly came to the sky over the North Bridge County government, scouting and circling, and then dropped three bombs, all of which landed in open space, causing no damage.</p>
<p>At 7:20 AM, an enemy plane flew over the Minhang bus station and dropped a bomb. Then, several of our planes flew over and the enemy plane fled in panic.</p>
<h3>Commander Wang Jingjiu Talks About the Capture of Wayside Wharf</h3>
<p>Wang's use of troops is extremely miraculous and brave. Completing the preliminary greatest mission.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Shanghai war, our army has won victory after victory. Last night, we occupied Wayside Wharf, cutting off the enemy's army, so that its left and right wings could not take care of each other. This is the greatest success since the War of Resistance. Seeing our army's rapid progress, the reporter went to the front line position of our army's central route in the rain of bullets this morning (yesterday morning). Through a friend's introduction, I met Wang Jingjiu, the commander of our army's ××× division who was responsible for commanding the two routes. Commander Wang served as the commander of the Eighty-seventh Division in the January 28th Incident, bravely resisting the enemy and repeatedly performing miraculous feats. Now, I see him again at a time of military tension. His heroic, bold, and calm spirit has not diminished in those years. When he received the reporter in the midst of his busy schedule, he explained the recent front-line war situation in concise and comprehensive terms, with clear organization, as if counting treasures. This proves that he has a clear plan in his mind, so he can kill the enemy and achieve results, and repeatedly perform celebratory feats.</p>
<p>Officers and Soldiers Embrace the Determination to Die</p>
<p>Commander Wang first said that we are fighting a war of self-defense. For decades, from the Sino-Japanese War to today, the anger towards the enemy has finally had the opportunity to be expressed. Therefore, all officers and soldiers can bravely resist the war with the determination to die. But the enemy army is the opposite, and it is entirely the militarism of the Japanese warlords. The soldiers are forced to go out, and the morale of the army is naturally difficult to boost. The art of war says that attacking the mind is the most important thing, so our army has long held the key to victory psychologically.</p>
<p>Three Routes Converge to Kill the Enemy</p>
<p>Commander Wang first said that since our army received the order, it quickly rushed to the Shanghai border and occupied favorable terrain. For the past week, ㊀, the eastern route has occupied the No. 1 Cotton Mill of the Public University, drove the enemy into the concession, and then advanced along Pingliang Road and Liping Road, clearing out the remaining enemy and occupying the Yufeng and Dakang cotton mills. At this moment, it is echoing the central and western routes, planning to completely drive out the enemy along the Pujiang River. ㊁, the central route has advanced westward from Gaolang Bridge and Lan Road, crossed Huade Road, Taopeng Road, Liaoyang Road, and Dalian Bay Road, and yesterday (that is, the day before yesterday) it has marched to Baoding Road, encircling the remaining enemy near the West Prison. It has further converged with the western route army between Tilanqiao, Wayside Wharf, and Osaka Wharf. ㊂, the western route has gained an advantage after occupying the Japanese Naval Training Ground. After several bloody battles, relying on the bravery and heroic spirit of our army, it destroyed the enemy's strong artillery bunkers and tanks, passed through Tianbao Road, Gongping Road, met at Zhoujiazui Road, Tangshan Road, Dongyouheng Road, Donghanbi Road, Dongxihuade Road, and Dongbai Road. Broadway Road, to complete the greatest mission, occupying Wayside Wharf last night (that is, the night before last).</p>
<p>Captured Six Enemy Tanks</p>
<p>It is estimated that last night (that is, the night before last), our army used the strength of the ×× regiment and the ×× regiment, under the leadership of senior officers who were covered in blood, to advance towards the predetermined target. The enemy army gathered heavy troops between the West Prison, the Nanyang Tobacco Company, and Wayside Wharf, using armored vehicles, tanks, machine guns, and mortars to fiercely resist us, but ultimately failed. In addition to occupying Wayside Wharf and important areas along the line, our army also captured six enemy tanks, several command knives, and countless other military supplies.</p>
<p>The Annihilation of the Stubborn Enemy Is Not Far Off</p>
<p>Commander Wang made a concluding remark due to the tense military situation, saying that the enemy in Shanghai has been cut off by us, and the date of annihilation is not far off. But this is the beginning of our nation's war of self-defense, so small victories are not worth celebrating. As a soldier, my duty is to defend the country, and there is nothing to boast about after a small victory. At this point, the reporter stood up to express his admiration and gratitude to Commander Wang, and chose what could be declared to the people of the country to publish as above, and to inspire them.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, several foreign reporters went to the front-line command headquarters yesterday morning to pay a visit to Commander Zhang Zhizhong and ask whether it was true that our army had occupied Wayside Wharf. Commander Zhang replied that our army had indeed occupied the place on the evening of the 19th. A reporter then asked why someone had seen Japanese troops still there this morning. Commander Zhang replied with a smile, "Please send someone to investigate, and you will know whether there are Chinese troops there." The reporter was silent and speechless. The occupation of Wayside Wharf by our army has been completely confirmed.</p>

<h3>Our Air Force Displays Magnificent Skills Over the Whangpoo River</h3>
<p>Westerners Witness and Praise with Admiration; Enemy Ships' Anti-Aircraft Guns Completely Ineffective</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The generals and soldiers of our air force have been fighting bravely for days. However, in the first few days, due to the dim skies, low clouds, and rain, they could not fully display their skills. Yesterday, our air force dispatched a large squadron at around 4:00 PM to bomb enemy bases over the Whangpoo River and Hongkew area. Because the sky was clear and bright, the magnificent skills of our air force were fully revealed. Westerners who witnessed the battle from the Bund praised it incessantly, marveling at it. Our air force, totaling six aircraft, divided into two teams. One team bombed the Wayside Wharf and Hongkew area, while the other team dropped bombs on the Japanese-owned Nichi-Hua Cotton Mill in Pudong. Although the enemy ships on the Whangpoo River hastily engaged in combat, our troops remained undeterred amidst the intense anti-aircraft fire. When they reached their destination, they suddenly dove down, flying at a very low altitude, and launched a bomb that hit its target. Simultaneously, they swiftly ascended into the clouds, demonstrating unparalleled agility and skill. The second bombing was carried out in the same manner. The Nichi-Hua Cotton Mill and Wayside Wharf areas were engulfed in raging fires. The anti-aircraft guns proved completely ineffective. Having achieved their objectives, they calmly departed.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that yesterday at 5:15 PM, four of our aircraft flew north along the southern bank of the Whangpoo River, using the raging flames from the burning houses in the Yangtzepoo and East Seward Road areas of Pudong as cover to bomb enemy positions in the Hongkew area. Therefore, when our aircraft arrived, the enemy ships were still unaware. At that time, one of our aircraft used skillful techniques to suddenly dive down from a high altitude and, after dropping a bomb, swiftly ascended into the sky, light as a swallow. The beauty of its posture was unprecedented. It was then that the enemy's various defense zones began to sound the alarm. Anti-aircraft shells from Japanese warships docked in the Whangpoo River were fired in rapid succession, but our aircraft had already vanished like a yellow crane. The bomb landed between Seward Road and Broadway, behind the Japanese consulate. The intensity of the resulting fire demonstrated the destructiveness of the bombing.</p>
<p>Several enemy aircraft flew to the Nanshi area yesterday morning to bomb, and two of them were shot down by our anti-aircraft fire, as confirmed by relevant sources.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that yesterday at around 11:00 AM, eleven enemy aircraft flew to Jiangyin to bomb our fortress and used poison gas bombs. However, because our side was prepared, there were no casualties.</p>
<p>Our Troops and Enemy Troops Engage in Fierce Aerial Combat</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Yesterday at around 7:10 AM, six Japanese aircraft flew to the Nanshi and Pudong areas to reconnoiter and dropped seven bombs near Rue de Fabrication. At around 8:00 AM, another enemy bomber took off from Woosung, escorted by six fighter planes, and dropped three bombs each on Rue Massenet and the Tangqiao area of Pudong. At that time, a large squadron of our aircraft arrived after hearing the news and immediately attacked the enemy aircraft. The two sides engaged in fierce aerial combat. The sound of machine guns firing was like a continuous string of pearls. Residents could hear it clearly. Stray bullets affected the western district, injuring several pedestrians. Soon, the enemy aircraft, unable to withstand the attack, fled towards Woosung. Our aircraft took advantage of the situation and pursued them, while our bombers, escorted by the aforementioned fighter planes, dropped bombs on the enemy warships in Woosung and the Whangpoo River.</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 4:00 PM, our air force once again dispatched aircraft to bomb the Yangtzepoo area, directly hitting the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. Immediately, black smoke billowed and the fire blazed into the sky. Because the enemy troops had stationed troops in the factory and stored a large amount of ammunition there, explosions occurred one after another, and the fire had not been extinguished late into the night. At around 5:00 PM, a squadron of our air force soared over the Whangpoo River. The enemy ships docked on the river surface fired with anti-aircraft guns, but our air force used a diving posture, swooping down from the sky and dropping several bombs on the enemy ships and the Japanese-owned Nichi-Hua Cotton Mill in Pudong. The Nichi-Hua Cotton Mill immediately caught fire, and dense black smoke rose into the sky. Several ships in the river were also in a state of panic and confusion. The sky and earth changed color, while our air force calmly returned triumphantly.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that yesterday morning, several enemy aircraft once again reconnoitered over Zhabei, Pudong, Nanshi, and Longhua, and dropped several bombs in various places. The first time was at around 7:00 AM, when six enemy aircraft divided into two small teams, circling several times from east to west before dropping bombs. There was a huge explosion, and our side responded with anti-aircraft fire, causing the enemy aircraft to flee in haste. About a few minutes later, three enemy aircraft reappeared in the clouds. Just as our aircraft arrived, the enemy aircraft tried to escape into the clouds, but our aircraft fired with machine guns. For a moment, the sound of gunfire was continuous, and stray bullets flew everywhere. Stray bullets landed in the southwest of the special zone, injuring pedestrians on the road. Our aircraft then flew to the Hongkew area to bomb enemy fortifications and enemy warships. Several places in Hongkew and Yangtzepoo were hit and caught fire, with flames soaring into the sky and the fire burning fiercely.</p>

<p>Enemy Aircraft Bomb Toyota Cotton Mill</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Yesterday at 2:15 PM, an enemy aircraft flew to the western part of Shanghai to bomb. Because the enemy aircraft feared our anti-aircraft fire, it flew in the clouds and never dared to fly low. Therefore, the bombs were dropped without aim, resulting in one bomb falling inside the Japanese-owned Toyota Cotton Mill. Several hundred enemy troops were originally stationed in the factory, but they were evacuated on the 14th and replaced by British troops. When the enemy aircraft dropped a bomb yesterday, the factory immediately caught fire, injuring one British soldier and four Chinese civilians. At that time, the fire was very large and had not been extinguished by night. However, the British troops were still stationed there.</p>
<p>Another report says that yesterday at 2:40 PM, six enemy aircraft circled over the Zhongshan Bridge in western Shanghai and dropped four large bombs, then used machine guns to strafe the villagers in the northern part of the Huangpu River before flying east.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Forced to Land in Pudong</p>
<p>Shenzhou News Agency reports that the day before yesterday, in the evening, an enemy light bomber crashed near the Lan Ni Du Ferry in Pudong. The aircraft was damaged by our anti-aircraft fire, forcing it to land in Pudong. After the aircraft landed, the two Japanese pilots and the White Russian pilot inside abandoned the aircraft and fled towards the Whangpoo River. At that time, many of our citizens witnessed the pilots fleeing in panic. Later, someone saw the Japanese pilots hiding in a foreign merchant's warehouse on the banks of the Whangpoo River and then crossing the river to the west bank from Pudong.</p>
<p>Enemy Bomb Kills American Merchant's Dairy Cows in Dachang</p>
<p>Dachang's rear was fiercely bombed by seven enemy aircraft this afternoon, dropping four bombs in the town of Dachang, and then dropping bombs on electric poles and grasslands, causing no damage. Upon inspection, two bombs landed in the fields west of Dachang town. Dairy cows at the American merchant's Red Seal Dairy Farm east of Dachang were killed by enemy bombing, accounting for two-tenths of the total. The farm has more than a hundred dairy cows, and an American flag is hung on the shed, but the enemy aircraft showed no regard.</p>
<p>Nanshi Attacked in Many Places Yesterday</p>
<p>At 7:01 yesterday morning, six enemy aircraft dropped bombs in Pudong and Nanshi, but were bombed by our anti-aircraft guns, causing them to flee in panic. The Pudong area was relatively quiet yesterday morning, except for the constant flights of enemy aircraft for reconnaissance. At 4:20 in the afternoon, several enemy aircraft came again to bomb, dropping several bombs one after another. Also, yesterday morning, eight enemy aircraft flew to our Bazibao frontline to bomb. Our army fiercely attacked with anti-aircraft guns for about half an hour before the enemy fled, and our position suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Nichi-Hua Cotton Mill Completely Burned Down</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Nichi-Hua Cotton Mill in the Yangjing District of Pudong caught fire again yesterday morning, and the fire spread very rapidly. According to people who came to Shanghai from Pudong, the factory is now almost completely burned down, leaving only the walls. The order in the area is peaceful, and the market is gradually recovering. According to reports, the Nichi-Hua Cotton Mill in Lujiazui, Pudong, has two parts, a new factory and an old factory, covering an area of ​​hundreds of acres. The old factory is located on the edge of Chuanjiang Road and has been in operation for more than thirty years. It is the originator of the Japanese merchants' cotton mills in Shanghai. Over the years, due to the development of business, a new factory was built on the edge of Pudong last year, with the latest equipment. Only one female worker is required to look after every sixteen machines. Production is rapid, and it is the main base for suppressing Chinese cotton mills. Since the Japanese army launched the Shanghai war, 70 to 80 Japanese soldiers were secretly hidden in the factory. On the 17th, when the enemy warships and our army were engaged in fierce artillery battles, the Japanese soldiers in the factory, disguised as plainclothes, led by one or two traitors, left the factory and attacked our Sanwanchang area. The defenders bravely resisted. After a half-hour battle, our reinforcements arrived, and the weaving room of the old factory was hit by a shell and caught fire. The Japanese army fled in panic. Our side took advantage of the victory and stormed in. The Japanese soldiers fled to the edge of the Whangpoo River and took small steamships to escape. After the fire spread for a day and night, the weaving room was completely destroyed. At about 7:00 yesterday morning, when our large squadron of aircraft bombed the Japanese warships, the spinning room of the old factory was hit by a shell and caught fire again. The fire was fierce and did not gradually extinguish until 3:00 in the afternoon. At this point, the entire old factory had been reduced to ashes. However, at 5:45 yesterday evening, our aircraft bombed the Japanese warships again, and the new factory was hit by a shell for the third time and caught fire. For a time, black smoke covered the sky. Standing on the Bund outside the concession, one could see the flames, and the burning was even more intense than that of the old factory. The fire did not extinguish until midnight. After these three fires, the entire factory has been reduced to ashes.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Meets with Foreign Journalists</h3>
<p>Talks About the War Are Very Humorous; We Have Launched a Full-Scale War of Resistance</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that five reporters from Reuters, Havas, Associated Press, TASS, and the Central News Agency, accompanied by Tang Wu, the representative of the Shanghai Garrison Command of the Jinghu Garrison Command, visited Jinghu Garrison Commander Zhang Zhizhong yesterday. Mr. Zhang met with them amidst his busy military affairs and answered the questions raised by the reporters in great detail. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Army Can Be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang first expressed his condolences for the reporters' long journey and then agreed to the reporters' request to explain the current war situation. According to Mr. Zhang, our army advanced to the Wayside Wharf last night (the 19th) and cut the Japanese army's entire line into two sections. The entire Japanese army in Shanghai has been surrounded by our army, like turtles in a jar, and can be completely resolved soon. The exact number of casualties suffered by our army in a week is currently not available. However, I can confidently tell you that the number of casualties suffered by the Japanese army is twice that of our army. As for the Japanese army currently fighting in the Hongkew and Yangtzepoo areas, it is estimated to be between 12,000 and 15,000. At this point, a reporter asked whether the Japanese claim that more than 80 Chinese aircraft have been shot down by the Japanese side is true. Mr. Zhang smiled and replied in a humorous tone, "I am Chinese and not good at making false propaganda." Upon hearing this, everyone present remembered the false information released by the Japanese side in recent days and smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>Protect the Lives and Property of Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang continued, "We must do our best to protect the lives and property of foreign nationals. This is not only an obligation under treaties, but also a moral necessity." Regarding the evacuation of foreign women and children in Shanghai this time, it seems unnecessary in general. However, in the event of uncontrollable accidents during the air combat between the Chinese and Japanese air forces that caused slight damage, this is another matter. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has notified the warships and merchant ships of various countries that they must stay five nautical miles away from the location of Japanese warships within twelve hours, or keep Japanese warships five nautical miles away from the location of the warships and merchant ships of various countries. I only saw this in the newspapers, but I firmly believe that this move by China is well-intentioned and is for the benefit and safety of all countries. As for the Japanese army, if it retreats to the south of the Suzhou River, the troops and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the concession should disarm. At this point, a reporter asked that if the Japanese army retreats to the south of the Suzhou River, and the troops and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the concession do not disarm, what will the Chinese army do? Mr. Zhang replied that this is a diplomatic issue and he would ask the government for instructions at that time, but China is definitely not Japan, and China has always respected international treaties.</p>
<p>Final Victory Will Surely Belong to Us</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang continued, "China has now launched a full-scale war of resistance. The longer the fighting, the more beneficial it will be for China. Therefore, it is difficult to predict when the full-scale war between China and Japan will end. The war may have to be extended to three years, five years, or even ten years, and even many territories in China may be occupied by Japan, but we firmly believe that the final victory will belong to China." From the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 to the present, China has never had a unified national war of resistance against Japan. The two battles of Shanghai and Nankow can be said to be formal confrontations between China and Japan. However, whether China will formally declare war on Japan is a decision made by the highest authorities in China, and I am a soldier and cannot answer. After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, we deeply felt that the Japanese army was not necessarily superior to the Chinese army, and the Chinese army was not necessarily weaker than the Japanese army. In fact, the Chinese army's combat ability even exceeded that of the Japanese army. After the end of the January 28th Shanghai Incident, we did not find any new weapons of the Japanese army. The weapons used by the Japanese army were not unexpected. Finally, a reporter asked what China would do if the Japanese army used poison gas in street battles. Mr. Zhang replied that China was prepared for the Japanese army's use of poison gas. Mr. Zhang asked in a rhetorical tone that he was not familiar with diplomacy and international law. If the Japanese army used poison gas, it would violate international law. After Mr. Zhang finished speaking, he looked at everyone present. The reporters deeply admired Mr. Zhang's sharp words and gentle attitude. At this point, they said goodbye and left.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Mobilize in North China</h3>
<p>Between 80,000 and 100,000 Troops; Defensive Works Being Hastily Constructed in the Suburbs of Tianjin</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Japanese troops continue to be transferred to North China in large numbers. Currently, there are 50 Japanese troop transport ships outside Dagu, carrying infantry, cavalry, and artillery units. Many of them are loaded with electrical equipment. At the same time, a large number of reinforcements from Shanhaiguan are also arriving in Tianjin. Some Japanese soldiers from Tanggu are taking barges to the upper reaches, while others are advancing on foot along the south bank of the river. Small teams of soldiers, showing signs of fatigue from long journeys, are passing through the British Concession day and night. It is estimated that there are currently about 80,000 Japanese troops gathered in North China, but some say that the total number is over 100,000. It is reported that Japanese troops are hastily constructing trench lines and other defensive works in the suburbs around Tianjin. This shows the panic of the Japanese troops in Tianjin. Chinese plainclothes troops are scattered and lurking. The Japanese side recently claimed a great victory over the Chinese army near Dagu, which proves that there are indeed Chinese troops in the Tianjin-Dagu area. Foreign concession authorities have issued warnings to prevent aerial bombardment, advising residents to take shelter in underground rooms during wartime to avoid stray bullets. Residents are now digging cellars to temporarily take shelter inside in case of emergency to avoid being injured by bombs, etc. For ease of identification, foreign concessions are flying large flags on the border during the day and using lights to mark them at night. Foreigners are currently very quiet and are doing business as usual, but in fact business has stalled and there is nothing to do. The French concession authorities are strongly urging refugees to return home, but the refugees are not returning to their villages and are only moving to the British Concession. Refugee women and children are everywhere on both sides of the road, and the situation is particularly miserable when it is cloudy and rainy. Many warehouses and empty houses have been converted into refugee shelters, but they are still not enough. The Japanese authorities have formally announced that the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council no longer exists and that the Maintenance of Order Committee will exercise its functions.

<h3>The Assurance of Victory Lies in Our Hands</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The battle situation in Shanghai has unfolded and now marks a full week. The developments in this week's battle situation demonstrate that our side, with its orderly military appearance, sophisticated weaponry, and resolute fighting spirit, has delivered a head-on blow to Japanese imperialism. The facts now tell us that the expansion of the war's scope and the prolongation of the war's duration pose no problems for us, but are absolutely unfavorable to the Japanese side. The assurance of final victory in this war lies entirely in our hands.</p>
<p>War is not something to be fantasized about arbitrarily, nor is it something to be treated as child's play. Previously, some people in our country harbored unwarranted concerns about the war of resistance. Previously, Japanese militarists believed that aggression against China could be pursued at will. Now that our war of resistance has been launched, it immediately proves that such fantasies and childishness were completely wrong. The experience of the past week of war has shown us several important facts. First, international sympathy is now entirely on our side. Second, the Japanese army and weaponry are not superior to ours. Third, our entire country is united and fighting the war with one heart, while on the Japanese side, the people hate the militarists and oppose aggression, revealing significant cracks in the political and social structure.</p>
<p>The above three points are the most important factors guaranteeing our victory. Now we can examine them separately.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Lugouqiao Incident, the international situation seemed unfavorable to our full-scale war of resistance. Britain was unwilling to see a serious deterioration of the situation in the Far East. The United States was considering the issue of neutrality laws. The Soviet Union was internally emphasizing military discipline and externally adopting a cautious approach. However, once our war of resistance in Shanghai was launched, international attention immediately shifted to the East. Newspapers in Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union unanimously criticized the Japanese imperialists' brutal acts of aggression. Most notably, the semi-official British newspaper, The Times, changed its previous conciliatory tone toward Japan, denouncing the Japanese militarists' infringement on Chinese sovereignty. The London authorities clearly felt that British interests in the East had been threatened by the Japanese aggression. The news of the withdrawal of American forces from China is still mostly Japanese propaganda, with less actual possibility. In fact, we believe that the spiritual and even material assistance that the United States and the Soviet Union can provide to our country will be greater than anything else. This is something that Japanese imperialism cannot obtain.</p>
<p>In the military aspect, once the war broke out, our air force immediately demonstrated its supreme power. We used offense to replace the past defensive posture. Our planes and heavy artillery prevented the Japanese army from crossing the line. In fact, the main force of the Japanese army fighting in Shanghai this time consists only of warships anchored in the river. Because of our army's valiant attacks, enemy reinforcements could not land, and the positions on the shore were gradually shrinking. The enemy's indiscriminate bombing with planes and heavy artillery only reveals the exhaustion of their fighting power. On the other hand, from north to south, from the border of Chahar to the coastal areas, our army is preparing for battle everywhere. The enemy is lashing out everywhere, and their military strength is becoming increasingly scattered. Their inability to sustain the war is an inevitable result.</p>
<p>As for the nation's will to fight, the experience of the past week has shown that our side is far superior to the enemy. Our entire country's military and civilian forces are now united as one, determined to sweep away all the forces of Japanese imperialism from our territory. However, within Japan, according to recent returnees, political parties and financial groups, though cowed by the militarists' oppression, dare not openly oppose the war. However, the economic pressure felt by small and medium-sized merchants, and the unwillingness of women to see their men sent to China to die, have already led to desertion and painful scenes of sorrow and anxiety. Even Japanese businesses in China fear the losses that this war will inflict upon them, and express resentment towards the ambitious militarists in their country. We are launching a nationwide war of resistance with a determination to die, while Japan is already experiencing social unrest and unease. This comparison of fundamental national strength further demonstrates that the assurance of final victory lies entirely in our hands.</p>
<h3>Mediation of Shanghai War, Japanese Hard-line Opposition</h3>
<p>Britain Tries for a Final Effort, Still Maintains Cooperation with France and the United States.</p>
<p>[London] The British proposal for a mutual withdrawal of troops by both Chinese and Japanese forces under guarantee is currently under consideration by the Chinese and Japanese governments. The British Foreign Office is also consulting with the French and American governments in Paris and Washington, requesting their cooperation. The authorities of Shanghai and Nanjing, as specified in the American proposal, are also working closely together on the protection of expatriates and British interests, which are highly valued by the British. There are currently five battalions of British troops and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in Shanghai, with three battalions being sent from elsewhere to replace them. (Reuters dispatch, 19th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The British government's proposal for the neutralization of the Shanghai International Settlement seems to have provoked strong opposition in Japan. This plan has effectively failed, but diplomatic circles believe that it has not been completely abandoned, indicating that the government seems to want to make further efforts towards Tokyo. (Havas dispatch, 20th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, if the news from Tokyo that Japan has rejected the British proposal to establish a Chinese zone in Shanghai is confirmed, it will cause the worst possible impression. The correspondent also said that all parties will then decide that the Japanese army's arrival in Shanghai is not solely for the protection of Japanese interests in the area, but to wage a war of aggression against China by any possible means. (Reuters dispatch, 20th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Washington] Authorities announced today that the U.S. government is closely considering the British proposal to establish a neutral zone in Shanghai, but the United States will not make any decisions on this for the time being. (Reuters dispatch, 19th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The British government proposed that Britain, France, and the United States request the Chinese and Japanese governments to withdraw their troops from the vicinity of the Shanghai concessions, with the deadline being the month before. The French government has formally accepted it. The United States has not yet responded. British officials recently declared that the U.S. government will fully cooperate with the various measures taken by the Shanghai side to protect the interests of all countries. Therefore, the United States will certainly agree to the request for troop withdrawal from China and Japan. British officials also said that the British government will inform the German and Italian governments of the details of its negotiations with the governments of Britain, France, the United States, China, and Japan.

<p>Unprecedented in Forty Years</p>
<p>[Manila] Today, as the first group of American refugees from Shanghai arrived here, Manila experienced two major earthquakes. Electric lights and telephone lines were cut off, and many shop windows were shattered. Movie theater audiences fled in panic. Observers said that the severity of the earthquake was unprecedented in forty years. Residents, fearing that their houses would collapse, dared not return home and all sought refuge in the streets.

<h3>Finance Minister Kong Delays Return Home</h3>
<p>Follows Doctor's Orders to Seek Treatment in Germany. We Are Fighting to Uphold International Treaties. The Embassy in London Issues a Communiqué.</p>
<p>⊙Genoa Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, who was originally scheduled to return home from here today on a German ship, has postponed his departure due to unfinished matters. It is widely believed that Kong may visit Prague tomorrow. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>⊙Genoa Dr. Kong Xiangxi, in an interview with a correspondent from Haitong News Agency here, reiterated China's determination to sacrifice everything to safeguard fundamental rights. He said that the general opinion in the countries he has passed through in recent days understands China's position, and he is deeply satisfied. Kong pointed out that China's military preparations are more substantial than in the past, and he is very calm about the outcome of the current military operations. China's resistance to Japanese aggression is not only for the survival of the nation but also for the maintenance of world peace and justice. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] The Embassy issued a communiqué today, recounting the various ways in which Japan has been aggressing against China since the September 18th Incident, and the various efforts of the Chinese government to resolve the dispute through diplomatic channels. It stated, "The Chinese government has now been compelled to resist Japan with force. This action is not only to defend its national territory and sovereignty but also to protect the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. If Japan can stop its aggression and pave the way for a fair solution to preserve peace in the Far East, then China, even at this juncture, has not abandoned its ardent desire for peace." (Havas dispatch, 19th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙Italy The Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi took the "Hohhot" ship to Germany today in the port of Genoa, Italy. Due to the doctor's orders, he must go to Baden for treatment.

<h3>Gu Weijun Visits French Deputy Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Discusses the Sino-Japanese Situation</p>
<p>[Paris] Deputy Foreign Minister Tedesani met with the Chinese Ambassador to France, Dr. Gu Weijun, this afternoon. The topic of discussion was the conflict between China and Japan. (Havas dispatch, 19th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>We No Longer Rely Entirely on the League of Nations and International Treaties</h3>
<p>The Lesson of the Manchurian Incident Is Not Far Away. Hu Shize Delivers a Speech in Geneva.</p>
<p>[Geneva] Dr. Hu Shize, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, recently delivered a speech at the International Student Residence, stating China's attitude towards the League of Nations. He said that based on China's past experience with the League of Nations, it is impossible for us to have excessive expectations of the League of Nations. This is not only the case for China, but also for other member states of the League of Nations. Since the September 18th Incident, international ethical standards have plummeted. It is difficult to believe that the international community can achieve its past failed objectives. I am not saying that China does not want to submit another application to the League of Nations, but we must not repeat the mistakes of the Manchurian Incident. The League of Nations and international treaties should still be respected by us and should be given a proper place in China's international relations. However, the past five years have taught us a lesson. We no longer rely entirely on the League of Nations and international treaties but can save the motherland with our own strength. This is what we can be proud of. (Havas dispatch, 20th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Sources in London's Chinese community say that China may soon appeal to the League of Nations based on Article 17 of the League of Nations Covenant. The reason why China has not taken this step earlier is that Western powers may not provide China with effective assistance. Now, this attitude has changed. China believes that it is now appropriate to draw the attention of other members of the League of Nations to Japanese aggression. (Reuters dispatch, 20th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Intense Sino-Japanese Conflict, Japan Considers It An Accidental Incident</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] It is said that the Japanese government will henceforth regard the conflict between China and Japan as a "Sino-Japanese Accidental Incident." Finance Minister Kaya claimed that the various expenses related to the Sino-Japanese incident would be covered by issuing bonds. (Reuters dispatch, 20th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japan's Aggression Against China Discards Worldwide Sympathy</h3>
<p>The London Times Urges Japan to Wake Up and Praises Our Strength in Resistance.</p>
<p>[London] Today's editorial in the Times on the Shanghai war concludes, "Japan should quickly realize that the freedom of action it wants to enjoy in East Asia must not, under any circumstances, infringe upon Britain's legitimate interests." The report further stated that Japan's recent actions in North China have discarded the sympathy of the world. Now, by rashly dispatching troops to Shanghai, it has lost more than just the world's sympathy. The Times stated, "Japan, relying on self-boasting and insufficient excuses, and without sufficient mediation, rashly started a war with China. Its methods of warfare have even led to military occupation of neutral countries' property, causing significant financial and material losses to the people of Britain and other countries. Now that recent British, French, and American mediation efforts have been rejected, other reconciliation attempts seem difficult to achieve. However, British rights and property, wherever they may be, are inviolable." The intensity of the criticism of Japan in the above article is the strongest in recent memory. The report also believes that the cause of the Shanghai war was the unreasonable behavior of the Japanese navy, no less than the ground forces in North China. The report stated that Japan has no concessions or any privileges in Hongkou or any area of the Public Concession, and the first to threaten the safety of Japanese residents were the actions of the Japanese military. Even if Japanese residents were truly in danger, they should have been evacuated first, as in the example of Japan evacuating its residents from Hankou. Furthermore, Japan's arbitrary trampling in the Yangshupu area of the Eastern District, which is the port of Shanghai, contains waterworks, power companies, and other public utilities, as well as other factories and spinning mills, all of which are foreign-owned property. British investment in the Yangshupu area is no less than 100 million pounds. The report ends by asking what the end result of this situation will be. (Reuters dispatch, 20th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The Times commented on the Sino-Japanese war in the Far East, believing that although victory or defeat has not yet been decided, the Chinese army has already demonstrated its courage and spirit of obedience. The Chinese Air Force was established not long ago, but it has always returned attacks from enemy aircraft. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Sino-U.S. Monetary Agreement Concluded</h3>
<p>Aimed at Promoting Trade</p>
<p>[Washington] With regard to the Sino-U.S. monetary agreement announced in July of this year, Acting Treasury Secretary Taylor wrote to Senator Boksson today, stating that the purpose of the agreement is to assist in the general process of China's monetary reform and the consolidation of the monetary system. As for other matters, they are related to diplomatic secrets and cannot be fully disclosed. However, the general purpose is to promote trade between the United States and China. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>French Warships Distributed in Sino-Vietnamese Area</h3>
<p>[Paris] The Navy Department issued a communiqué today, explaining the distribution of French warships in the area between China and Vietnam. It stated: (1) The cruiser "Lamotte-Picquet," the flagship of Vice Admiral Bigo, commander of the French fleet, and the gunboats "Dumont d'Urville," "Savorgnan de Brazza," and "Duguay-Trouin" are stationed in Shanghai. The French concession troops and naval infantry are under the command of Vice Admiral Bigo to protect the concession and its residents. When necessary, the warships will also carry French residents out of Shanghai. (2) The gunboats "Admiral Charner" and "Francis Garnier" are stationed on the Yangtze River in Nanjing. (3) The gunboat "La Grandière" patrols the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and is responsible for protecting the French concession in Hankou. (4) The gunboat "Balny" patrols the upper reaches of the Yangtze River near Chongqing. (5) The gunboat "D'Iberville" is stationed off Beidaihe. (6) The gunboat "Argos" is stationed in Guangzhou, responsible for protecting the French concession in Shamian. (7) The French fleet in Vietnam consists of six gunboats: "La Marne," "Avalanche," "Commandant Duba," "Mitrailleuse," "Tourane," and "Vigilante." (Havas dispatch, 19th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japan Should Be Held Responsible for Losses Incurred by British Businesses in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Regarding the Occupation of Jardine Brewery, the British Government Strongly Protests to Japan.</p>
<p>[London] Regarding how to deal with the occupation of British buildings in Shanghai, London clarified today that the British government should immediately demand compensation for losses, commercial interests, and reputational damage. For example, in the case of the occupation of Jardine Brewery by the Japanese army, the British government has lodged a strong protest with the Tokyo government, demanding rent and compensation for all losses. Furthermore, the Japanese army has also occupied the floors above the ninth floor of the Broadway Mansions. Apart from Jardine Brewery, there is no further news on how to deal with this. There are many other similar cases. It is also questionable how to deal with British houses destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, as the claim for damages, from an academic point of view, is uncertain as to whether it should be made to China, which has territorial sovereignty, or to Japan, which engaged in the destruction. (Reuters dispatch, 19th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Our city's Reuters dispatch: Today, Jardine Company announced that the Jardine Brewery has not been occupied by the Japanese army, only garrisoned by them. The Japanese army allows it to operate as usual, and the brewery is still shipping goods continuously.</p>
<p>Reuters News of our city, Broadway Mansions manager Hershey categorically denied that the Japanese army occupied the building's houses, or that the building housed Japanese refugees, and said that the misleading news about the building made the building vulnerable to air strikes.</p>

<h3>Commander Yang Speaks on the Legal Procedures for Punishing Traitors</h3>
<p>Chinese Territory: Arrest and Hand Over to the Police; Special Zone: Escort to the Police Station</p>
<p>Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison and concurrently Commander of the Shanghai Martial Law Command, has taken office. According to Commander Yang, since the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, people from all walks of life in the city have, out of patriotic sincerity, reported traitors. This motive is pure and deeply gratifying. However, there are occasionally treacherous people who take advantage of the public's psychology, making false accusations out of personal grudges, confusing right and wrong, and causing unnecessary social disputes, which is regrettable. At the beginning of its establishment, this headquarters has already notified the police agencies in the special zones of this city. In the future, it is sincerely hoped that patriotic compatriots, if they discover the activities of traitors or those with suspicious behavior, should arrest and hand them over to the police in the Chinese territory, and escort them to the police station in the special zone. They will be punished according to law to uphold national laws and social order.</p>
<h3>Traffic Disrupted on the Bund Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Preventing Defeated Soldiers from Retreating into the Concessions; French Infantry Will Also Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The authorities of the Public Concession, due to the fierce fighting in the eastern district of Shanghai yesterday morning, with intense artillery fire and stray bullets flying, in order to avoid accidents and prevent the Japanese army from collapsing and fleeing across the Waibaidu Bridge southward, specially ordered the Bund area to be declared under temporary martial law, and dispatched additional British and American armed forces and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to strengthen the defense on the bridge. The situation was very tense. Therefore, starting from the morning, from Avenue Edward VII northward to Waibaidu Bridge, pedestrians were only allowed to pass after being questioned by the stationed police and confirming that they had legitimate business or were journalists. The intersections of Guangdong Road, Fuzhou Road, Hankou Road, Jiujiang Road, Nanjing Road, Beijing Road, etc., were also guarded by police and British soldiers. Apart from a few foreign cars and British military transport vehicles, there were few pedestrians on the Huangpu Bund Road. West of Waibaidu Bridge to the Waterworks Bridge, except for ambulances, no other vehicles were allowed to pass.</p>
<p>The French Concession, in order to protect the safety of the bridge people, dispatched 1,000 infantrymen from Annam to China. They departed from Saigon a few days ago and are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd. After the infantrymen arrive in Shanghai, they will be deployed to defend the perimeter of the French Concession. The current police force of the French Concession totals several thousand people, which is sufficient to ensure defense. After the arrival of the army, the defense will be further consolidated. There are now French soldiers stationed along Avenue Edward VII and the Bund.</p>
<h3>More Than 200 American Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai from the Philippines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 200 American soldiers arrived at Wusongkou from Manila on the President Hoover, transferred to a small steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and sailed into the Huangpu River. They landed at the Jianghai Customs Wharf at around 2 PM and will be responsible for the defense of the concessions in the city starting today.</p>
<h3>Traffic Conditions In and Out of the City</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Operates as Usual</p>
<p>Since the afternoon of the 18th, traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was disrupted due to enemy aircraft bombing Bridge No. 31 between Songjiang and Shihudang, causing damage to the tracks and wires. The Railway Bureau dispatched craftsmen to repair it, and it has been completely repaired. Therefore, the South Railway Station resumed traffic as usual yesterday, with a total of four passenger trains departing at 8:30 AM, 9:18 AM, 11:10 AM, and 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>French Concession Tramway Resumes</p>
<p>Following the Public Concession, traffic in the French Concession resumed yesterday, starting with the tramway. Lines 2, 4, 7, and 10 were restored, but they only ran to the Bund on Avenue Dubail and did not go to the Sixteen Pups temporarily. The French Tramway Company's bus route 22 and 22 will also resume operation within the next few days. As for the traffic police dispatched by the French Concession Police Department for security, they have now resumed their duties of directing traffic due to the resumption of traffic. Therefore, although the tram passengers were crowded, the order was well maintained. At the same time, the iron gate traffic between the French Concession and the Chinese area of Nanshi, such as Laobeimen, was opened yesterday, and those with French Concession traffic permits could enter and exit freely, but the security at each passage was still quite tight.</p>
<p>Ningxing Steamer Scheduled to Sail to Ningbo</p>
<p>The Ningbo steamer of the Sanbei Branch Company is scheduled to sail to Ningbo at 12:00 on the 21st. The ticket office is located on the second floor of the Ningbo Fellow Association. Those who take the official cabin on this ship must purchase tickets in advance before boarding the ship. The remaining steerage cabins, except for refugees, will be sold on the ship, and passengers can board the ship directly.</p>
<p>Inland Waterway Shipping Under Negotiation</p>
<p>Inland waterway traffic has been cut off for many days. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the authorities a few days ago requesting the resumption of navigation to facilitate passengers and travelers. Subsequently, the Local Association also sent representatives Yan Qingxiang and others to request instructions from the Ministry of Communications. It is now heard that this matter is currently being discussed by the Maritime Administration and the Inland Waterway Shipping Association, and it will be realized soon.</p>
<h3>French Military Attaché Sabattier Visits Zhang Zhizhong</h3>
<p>Mr. Sabattier, French military attaché to China, visited Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Jinghu Garrison, yesterday and inspected the positions of our army. Mr. Sabattier expressed his admiration for the loyalty and bravery of our soldiers and the strength of the defense works.</p>
<h3>Fellow Associations and Organizations Expand Relief for War Zone Refugees</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Negotiates with Various Parties; Two Ships Sent to the Interior Daily to Transport Refugees; Relief Association Considers Seeking Takeover of Shelters</p>
<p>In order to expand relief for war zone refugees, the Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charitable Organizations established the "War Zone Refugee Relief Committee" under the association. According to a report by a Huadong News Agency reporter yesterday morning, the committee has established positions for chairman, vice chairman, secretary, accountant, negotiator, relief, general affairs, transportation, medical, investigation, deportation, supply, and publicity, with Qu Wenliu as chairman and Huang Hanzhi as vice chairman. The committee has begun to operate and is actively providing relief to war zone refugees. The address of the committee is located at Renji Hall on Yunnan Road.</p>
<p>Negotiations for Refugees Going to Ningbo Completed</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai, in view of the large number of refugees in the concessions, the difficulty of providing supplies, the concern for public security, and the occasional obstruction of land and sea transportation, has tried various methods for the sake of rescuing the masses. With the support of the Public Works Department, he requested the Consular Body to protect the safety of refugees leaving the country, which has been approved. He also telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting that the front lines be notified to provide uniform protection. Refugees from Zhejiang Province or those who can transfer to neighboring provinces will be sent to safe areas in the interior by two ships daily from the Sanbei and Ningshao Companies, or by renting ships, and will be transferred to their original homes separately. The ships transporting refugees will be marked with the flag of the Public Works Department of the concession for identification to avoid danger. This method will be implemented as soon as the procedures are completed.</p>
<p>Refugees from Songjiang Begin to be Deported</p>
<p>The deportation team of the Municipal Relief Committee, after statistically allocating the refugees staying in the shelters, sent the first batch of refugees by car under the escort of the team members to the Songjiang area yesterday morning. Deportation to other places is also proceeding successively. However, the team still lacks trucks and small civilian boats, and hopes that all sectors will donate or lend them as much as possible. The contact point is the temporary office of the deportation team on the second floor of the Pudong Fellow Association.</p>
<p>Jiangyin Compatriots Deported Back to Their Hometown</p>
<p>The Jiangyin Fellow Association in Shanghai, in view of the seriousness of the current situation, established the Jiangyin Fellow Association Relief Association in Shanghai as early as the 8th of this month, passed the articles of association, elected executive committee members, and rented houses at 474 Zhejiang Road and 225 Fujian Road to establish three refugee shelters. Since the outbreak of the war on the 13th, the reception team began to receive refugees. By the 17th, all the shelters were overcrowded, with a total of more than 4,000 refugees. The association sent personnel to hire ships for deportation and continued reception. As a result, only one tugboat and fourteen civilian boats were hired. The hired tugboat was needed for public use by the Maritime Administration and the Huzhe Society. After the association's negotiation, it was exempted, and on the 18th, it led 2,300 refugees back to their hometown. It is now continuing to receive and find ways to deport refugees. Those refugees who want to request reception or deportation back to their hometown can register at the shelters at 474 Zhejiang Road and 225 Fujian Road.</p>
<p>Foreigners Generously Shelter Refugees</p>
<p>The refugee shelter organized by the Changzhou Fellow Association has several hundred people arriving every day. Although methods have been taken to deport them successively, the vacant land in the association is often difficult to accommodate. Fortunately, Mr. Hulsey Sifford of the American China Trading Company generously rented a large Western-style house on Jing'an Temple Road free of charge, so that refugees standing on the street with their elderly and children could be settled. The Westerner would rather give up a huge rent, and his enthusiasm for benefiting refugees is worthy of emulation by our people.</p>
<p>All Shelters Welcome Takeovers</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Municipal Relief Committee has actively presided over the reception of refugees. In the past week, it has received more than 40,000 people and established more than 100 shelters. Refugees are still arriving in droves. It is heard that the association has decided that any charitable organization or private individual in the city who is willing to take over the established shelters of the association and provide supplies can go to negotiate. The takeover party can decide whether to retain the management personnel sent by the association, and can freely transfer and dispatch services without any problems, so that the association can free up manpower and financial resources to manage other shelters. There are many people in Shanghai who are eager to do good, and they should be able to actively participate in this grand undertaking of this extraordinary period and accumulate immeasurable merit.</p>
<p>Refugees in Pudong Eagerly Await Rescue</p>
<p>In the past two days, the targets of enemy aircraft bombings have been the Jiangnan Shipyard in Nanshi and the Longhua Airport. Fortunately, our army was prepared and the enemy did not succeed. It is also learned that our army in Pudong is strong, but there are many refugees. Every morning, more than a dozen enemy aircraft go there to circle and bomb indiscriminately. Civilians flee in panic and are very frightened. Relief efforts are still lacking organization, so the refugees in Pudong are eagerly awaiting the rescue of the Shanghai relief agencies.</p>
<h3>People Make Their Own Gas Masks</h3>
<p>Announced by the Special Education Association</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Gongzhan, chairman of the China Special Education Association, for the sake of public safety, specially invited members of the association to study simple, effective, and inexpensive methods of gas protection. The association has found a method for manufacturing gas masks that was widely used by the people of the Allied countries during the European War and has announced it to the country so that people can wear them at any time. The gas mask has been tested by Liang Qikui, technician of the Chemistry Department of the Health Department, and Zhou Shang and Sun Jiaqi, members of the Shanghai Health Education Association. They opened poisonous gas in a closed room while wearing the gas mask and proved that it could resist the poisonous gas for ten minutes. There are more than 20 types of poisonous gas in total. If judged by physiological harm, there are five types: ㊀ suffocating poisonous gas, ㊁ internal injury poisonous gas, ㊂ tear gas, ㊃ sneeze gas, ㊄ blistering gas. If this mask is worn with airtight goggles, it can resist ㊀ the suffocation of chlorine gas, ㊁ the internal injury of Dichloroethylarsine, ㊂ the tearing of Bromo-acetone chloropicrin, and ㊃ the sneezing of Dichloroethylarsine Dibromo erhylarsine, etc. The method of making this gas mask and the medicine used are recorded below: ㊀ 20 layers of gauze and 4 layers of cotton, each 15.5 cm wide and 18 cm long. Each four layers of gauze are sandwiched with a layer of cotton, and the inner and outer surfaces are double layers of gauze. Do not apply medicine to the inner layer of gauze and cotton for easy breathing. In total, 45 cm of gauze and 15 cm of cotton are used. ㊁ Four strips of tape, each one foot long, are used to tie at the back of the head. ㊂ 40 cm of mushroom oil, 10 cm of glycerin, 10 cm of soft soap, 0.5 cm of sodium carbonate, 5 cm of yellow sodium sulfate, 5 cm of Urotropine, and 10 cm of water. Grind finely and apply to the gauze. The above supplies are for one adult mask, and the price is about 2.5 French currency. The chairman of the association is still studying masks with longer gas protection time. However, this mask saved hundreds of thousands of people during the European War.</p>
<h3>Old Man Dies After Drinking Tea; Confirmed Poisoning</h3>
<p>Cai Yiren, a 52-year-old man, originally lived in the North Zhejiang Road area. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, he moved to the vicinity of Zhao Jiaqiao on He de Road in West Shanghai. At 4:20 PM the day before yesterday, Cai went out for something. Because the weather was hot and he was very thirsty, he took tea from the tea tank beside the Zhao Jiaqiao road. Unexpectedly, after drinking the tea, Cai fell to the ground after walking less than 200 meters due to poisoning. After being discovered, he was urgently called an ambulance and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Because the toxicity was severe, he died within a few minutes. After receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Police immediately ordered detectives to rush to the scene to search the tea tank, but the tea tanks in the vicinity had all disappeared. The corpse of Cai was examined and verified by Tang Peiyou, prosecutor of the Special First Court, and forensic doctor Zhang Tu, who confirmed that he died from drinking a highly toxic substance. They ordered the coffin to be prepared and ordered the police to strictly arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>The Rumor of Shooting at Airplanes Over the French Concession Is Absurd</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a rumor spread in the city, stating that during the air battle yesterday morning, when our air force planes flew over the French Concession, someone inside the concession used a rifle to attack them. This newspaper's reporter made detailed inquiries from all parties and proved that the rumor was completely absurd.</p>
<h3>Students Going to the United States Will Discuss Departure Methods Today</h3>
<p>More than 200 students going to the United States this year were originally scheduled to depart in seven batches starting on the 14th of this month. However, the Shanghai war broke out on the 13th of this month, and the ship tickets they had purchased were all affected because the ships were busy transporting foreign women and children out of Shanghai, making it impossible for the students to depart. It is now heard that the Asia Queen ship, after transporting a batch of foreign women and children from this city to Hong Kong the other day, will soon return to Shanghai within the week. The students preparing to go abroad may be able to take this ship to sail. However, in order to discuss specific methods, more than 20 students have initiated a meeting of all students going to the United States at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss ways to proceed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reporter Overturns</h3>
<p>Zi Lin Bao reported that on the 19th morning, a representative of the Manchuria Daily News and a reporter from the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun were traveling in a car when they reached the vicinity of Hongkou Park. The driver tried to avoid a mortar shell, causing the car to overturn on the side of the road. Both were injured. Also, a car of the Tongmeng News Agency was driving near the Broadway Road of Gonghexiang Wharf on the afternoon of the 19th when it was hit by a machine gun fired by Chinese soldiers, causing the car's tires to burst. The driver could not control the car, and it crashed into a wall. The four people in the car were not injured, but the car was abandoned on the side of the road.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Does Not Give Up Police Power</h3>
<p>Sending Western Police to Patrol Hongkou</p>
<p>The police authorities of the Public Concession, due to the danger of artillery fire in the eastern district of Shanghai, had to order a gradual withdrawal. However, the Public Works Department is still unwilling to abandon its police power in the area. Therefore, starting yesterday, it ordered sixty Western police officers to patrol the eastern and Hongkou areas of Shanghai in teams to show that although the police station has withdrawn, the police power is not abandoned. It is reported that the reason why the Public Works Department is doing this is that when the police stations in the eastern district of Shanghai withdrew, Japanese soldiers still forced the Western directors of the police stations to sign documents transferring police power to Japanese management.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Association Asks the Ministry of Finance Not to Restrict Withdrawals of Small Deposits</h3>
<p>Support the Issuance of National Salvation Bonds</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Association of this city submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "To Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance: As the violent enemy presses on our borders, the government has launched a full-scale war of resistance. Your ministry has formulated seven measures to stabilize finance and restrict foreign limits, which are well-planned and supported by the whole country. However, this city is the center of commerce and industry, and the flow of funds is urgently needed. Therefore, we propose that small deposits of the business community and citizens, all those under 500 yuan, should be allowed to withdraw without restrictions, in order to maintain the market and secure the livelihood of the people. Is this appropriate? We respectfully request that you review and implement it. It is truly for the public convenience." The association also submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, expressing its support for the issuance of national salvation bonds.</p>
<h3>Relocation of Organizations and Institutions</h3>
<p>The autopsy institute of the Public Concession, which was moved to the open space of the old four-person prison on Xiamen Road, will be relocated to the Jiaozhou Park on Kangding Road and Changping Road starting today.</p>

On the same day last year, the highest was 91.6 and the lowest was 77.7.</p>
<h3>Tao Baichuan Speaks About His Experience in Consoleing the Troops at the Front</h3>
<p>Everyone Embraces a Death Wish to Carve Out a Path to Survival</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan, a member of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Support Association, recently went to the front line to慰勞 the troops. Yesterday, he broadcast a speech on the China-West Radio Station titled "Good News from the Front Line." The following is an excerpt from his speech: "At 6:00 AM on the 18th, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Wang Manyun, and I, a group of four, drove to the front lines to慰勞 the troops on behalf of the Municipal Party Department. Passing Zhenru, we saw the rescue team compiled by the students of the Southeast College, blocking our way. They said that the enemy plane had bombed Southeast at 5:30, dropping more than ten bombs, seriously injuring four people, and completely destroying the school buildings. They asked us to take a lightly injured doctor and a large number of medicines to a certain place and instructed us to inform a certain place and quickly send an ambulance to rescue the injured. We did so one by one. When we arrived at a certain place, we went through four agencies, met five staff members, and finally found the office of Commander Zhang Wenbo. Commander Zhang told us about the general situation of the battles in the past six days. He said that the spirit of sacrifice of our army far exceeds that of the enemy, while the number of enemy casualties is about two and a half to three times that of our army. This is what is meant by 'placing oneself in a position of death to live.' Everyone embraces a death wish, so they can carve out a path to survival. Commander Zhang is very optimistic about the future of the war. He said that no matter how many reinforcements the Japanese send, they will never have the possibility of winning. However, because the fortifications in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas are solid, the attack will take a considerable amount of time and require extremely great sacrifices, because the Japanese have built the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas into fortresses as strong as those after the January 28th Incident. Regarding the Pudong area, Commander Zhang said that our army has extremely powerful artillery that can compete with the Japanese artillery with a range of 25 kilometers, so there is no problem. Regarding the defenses from Liuhe to Jiangyin, Commander Zhang said that we are very willing to fight the enemy in Liuhe and other places, because the enemy has no artillery positions there, tanks cannot land, and the naval artillery cannot be indiscriminately bombarded because the enemy has landed, and they are not as familiar with the terrain as in Hongkou. Our army is waiting for work, and we can definitely annihilate them. We said that the citizens of Shanghai are very willing to mobilize manpower and material resources to support the anti-Japanese soldiers, but many do not know how to work hard. We then listed several questions and asked Commander Zhang to advise us. He said that the government has made considerable preparations for personnel and materials, but because the war has expanded and prolonged, it naturally needs assistance from all parties. The most needed now is麻袋, because officers and soldiers must carry麻袋 with them, whether they are advancing or retreating, so that they can be filled into sandbags at any time. The second is transportation equipment, such as cars, gasoline, motorcycles, and bicycles. The third is communication equipment, such as telephones and wires. As for manpower, Commander Zhang said that it is not very needed at the moment. If the people can work hard in their production posts, it can also be said that they are participating in the war. Commander Zhang also said that the headquarters has a rear people's war service plan that can be referenced. We also talked about how to unblock the residents of Shanghai. Commander Zhang said that he had received our telegram, and he hoped to restore the transportation between Shanghai and the interior as soon as possible under the condition of not hindering military affairs. He has handed it over to the General Staff Office to study a win-win method, which will be decided soon. We talked with Commander Zhang for thirty or forty minutes, and then we said goodbye to Commander Zhang to meet Commander Yang and Chief of Staff Tong. They also told us a lot of war news. When we parted, we all looked reluctant. Commander Yang repeatedly urged us to pay attention to the dropping of bombs from airplanes. On the way back, we did encounter two enemy planes. We got out of the car three times in a row and hid under the trees, and fortunately we avoided disaster. When we returned to Shanghai, we learned that the plane that had just chased us had fired guns and injured a boy scout in the慰勞 car of the Support Association. As everyone knows, our慰勞 car has no resistance, so the enemy plane flew very low. In addition to dropping bombs, it also fired machine guns. However, it only managed to bomb and injure one of us, which shows that enemy planes are not as terrible as people imagine."</p>

<h3>Our Army Fiercely Attacks, the Enemy Resists Stubbornly, the Eastern District of Shanghai Burns Into a Scorched Earth</h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Drop Bombs Everywhere, None Hit, Jiangwan Road Crosses South of the Enemy Headquarters</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) According to reliable reports, after the enemy's positions were cut into two sections by us, our Jiangwan Road Qingyun Road area was ordered to advance. However, from yesterday morning to evening, because it was daytime and enemy planes frequently came to wreak havoc, we were unable to advance as much as possible. After 7:00 PM last night, we launched attacks on the enemy's headquarters simultaneously from various routes. Our army concentrated firepower with a large number of mortars, covering the infantry's advance. At the sound of an order, everyone bravely advanced. The enemy troops responded in a panic, and bloody battles lasted for a long time. The enemy troops suffered heavy casualties, and we also suffered losses. At about 12:00, the enemy troops could not hold out and retreated southward one after another. We then pursued the victory. When we reached the northern wall of the headquarters, we confronted each other for a long time. It was not until about 1:00 AM this morning that we bypassed the enemy's firm fortress-like headquarters in the midst of shouts of killing and advanced more than 100 meters to the south. The enemy troops retreated in dense formations to the area south of the bottom of North Sichuan Road and north of Yokohama Bridge. Only a few troops remained on the front line, still stubbornly resisting, but the enemy's courage had been chilled. The entire front line is already shaking.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After our army occupied the enemy's landing base, Huishan Wharf, and cut off its entire line, the enemy was panicked, but still fought like a trapped beast, hoping to save the situation. Last night, the enemy concentrated many tanks and armored vehicles and launched a fierce attack on the lost positions. Our army also concentrated artillery fire and used extremely fierce explosives to counterattack head-on. The fierce battle lasted until late at night, and the enemy retreated without any progress, abandoning corpses scattered all over the ground. According to the spies captured on the front line of Baziqiao last night, after the enemy lost Huishan Wharf, the morale of the army was indeed unusually flustered, and a state of embarrassment and helplessness could be seen everywhere.</p>
<h3>Trapped Beasts Still Fighting at Huishan Wharf</h3>
<p>Fierce Battles Lasted for More Than Twenty Hours, We Used Fire to Encircle and Attack Yangshupu</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Our army seized the enemy's hinterland, occupied Huishan Wharf, and built fortifications on one side, while attacking the enemy in different ways. The enemy to the west also launched a fierce counterattack against our positions with a large number of iron armored vehicles, hoping to fight like a trapped beast. From the night before last until this morning, bloody battles lasted for more than twenty hours. Last night was especially fierce. Enemy casualties were scattered everywhere, and our side also suffered considerable damage. In addition, in the Yangshupu area, most of the enemy troops hid in city houses to fight. Last night, our army used fire to encircle and attack, so the fire was bright at night and has not been extinguished until noon today.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after our army occupied the positions in the Huishan Wharf area, it immediately built solid defensive fortifications. The rear troops have also successively moved in, and the military strength is quite strong. The enemy army launched several fierce counterattacks against us from last night to dawn this morning, but were all repelled by our army. The enemy army suffered many casualties.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Positions Shrinking</h3>
<p>Our military authorities have received reports that the enemy's original 30-mile-long positions have now been surrounded and forced to shrink to within only 15 miles. The range is extremely small, and it has been cut into two sections by us. Moreover, the Yangtze River Fleet is even more in a heavy siege, making it difficult to gain a foothold. Although a large number of reinforcements have arrived outside the port, they cannot land due to our strong military force along the river. There is also no room for development in Pudong. According to our military officer, who spoke to our reporter yesterday, although the enemy's situation is currently bad, they are determined not to give up. They will soon attack with all their strength. Our side is fully prepared to resist the enemy to the end and will never give up in the slightest.</p>
<h3>The Story of Our Army Attacking the Enemy Headquarters</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At around 5:00 AM today, our reporter met Liu Linsheng, a soldier who had returned wounded from Jiangwan Road at dawn this morning. According to his account, the story of our army attacking the Japanese headquarters on Jiangwan Road last night was very detailed. We are recording his story as follows:</p>
<p>"The enemy headquarters on Jiangwan Road has been destroyed by our army's artillery fire and air force since the start of the war. However, the walls there are built with three layers of thick steel plates, so at first glance, the appearance is still intact, but the interior is actually in a chaotic and ruined state. At the same time, there are underground cellars inside, which seem to be connected to the nearby main force of the enemy army. Therefore, although the headquarters has been surrounded by our army on all sides, its remaining troops still appear from time to time during the day and shoot at us, but soon they become silent again, because they have escaped into the wall again. Our army knew its cunning and decided not to pay attention to it, but still surrounded it heavily, thinking of capturing it in one fell swoop. At 8:00 PM last night (20th), the troops stationed at the Patriotic Girls' School, Guangdong East Middle School, and Chizhi University on Jiangwan Road were ordered to besiege the headquarters, with the purpose of destroying the enemy's nest. At that time, our large battalion of mortars and children's artillery team were dispatched to cover. At the sound of a horn, guns and cannons fired together, and our army was brave and spirited, all vying to be the first, and rushed straight to the enemy's nest with extremely agile tactics. At that time, the Japanese army was caught off guard and panicked. After the enemy soldiers were suppressed by force by the officers, they reluctantly responded. After being heavily suppressed by our artillery fire, the enemy gradually could not hold out, but its reinforcements had arrived, so the fierce battle restarted. Our army, regardless of its own safety, fought the enemy with hand grenades and bayonets. For a time, bullets were like rain, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. The sound of our army's shouts of killing shook the sky. The enemy soldiers advanced and retreated several times. The fierce battle lasted for more than two hours. At about 12:00 midnight, the enemy soldiers suffered heavy casualties, and blood flowed into rivers. Finally, they could not hold out and all withdrew from the headquarters, fleeing south along North Sichuan Road and Dissway Road. And I (Liu claimed) was injured at that time, but my mind was still clear. I witnessed our troops advancing and exceeding the enemy headquarters by about 100 meters to the east. I could not report on the progress after that because I had passed out. However, I now know that solid positions have been built there by us. But there is one more thing worth mentioning, that is, a few days ago, when we were ordered to advance to Jiangwan Road and occupy the Japanese army positions in the Patriotic Girls' School, Guangdong East Middle School, and Chizhi University, there were more than a dozen Japanese soldiers in the Patriotic Girls' School. Because the surrounding area had been surrounded by our army, they did not have time to escape and were disarmed and captured by our army and escorted to the rear for detention. I thanked him to keep him from getting tired, and wished him a speedy recovery."</p>
<p>The Eastern District of Shanghai Becomes a Huge Volcano</p>
<p>The enemy positions in the Yangshupu Road and Hongkou areas were hit by our air force and giant cannons one after another and caught fire. The fire was fierce. At about 5:00 AM this morning, the fire was slightly extinguished. Then at 10:00 AM, multiple places caught fire again after being shelled. According to refugees who escaped from Xinji Bang Road, New News Agency reporters, Xinji Bang Road, Zhaofeng Road, Dengtuo Road, Tangshan Road, Dongyouheng Road, Gongping Road, Maohai Road, Kunming Road, and other houses were surrounded by fire and burning. The fire was the fiercest on Broadway Road, Zhuangyuan Da, Yuanfang Road, and Lihong Bridge. This afternoon, reporters looked from the waterworks bridge and saw only raging flames and thick smoke covering the sky, forming a huge volcano. The intensity of the fire was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday morning, several places on Hongkou Wenjianshi Road, Wuchang Road, and Gongping Road caught fire and spread. Thick smoke blocked the sun, and flames soared into the sky. It was still burning at the time of publication.</p>
<p>According to the Public Concession Public Works Department Information Room, at 7:00 PM on the 20th, fires raged in the Huishan area, from Seward Road in the north to Broadway Road in the south, from Dentuo Road in the east to Huaji Road in the west. At 8:10, there were large fires about two miles east of the east side of the Seward Road Prison and east of the North Station. At 10:00, three Japanese warships in the Huangpu River opened fire on Pudong.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM on the 21st, the northeast wind was quite strong. The following places caught fire: ㊀ Near the Zhoujiazui kerosene wharf, ㊁ West of the Nanyang Tobacco Company on Broadway Road, ㊂ Huaji Road, ㊃ The intersection of Hankou Road and Wuzhou Road. At 8:22, there was also a large fire about a quarter of a mile east of the Seward Road Prison. At 9:30, the intersection of Broadway Road and Gongping Road also caught fire.</p>
<p>The Remnants of the Enemy Retreat to East Broadway Road</p>
<p>After our army concentrated its forces at Huishan Wharf yesterday and deployed various defensive works, it developed to the east and west along the lines of Gongping Road, Dengtuo Road, Maohai Road, Xinji Bang Road, Lianhua Road, Seward Road, Kunming Road, and Caobang Road. Last night, there were fierce street battles on Xinji Bang Road, Yuanfang Road, and Huaji Road. Until this morning, our army had advanced to the intersection of Yuanfang Road and Huade Road, and from Huade Road west to the vicinity of Lihong Bridge. The traffic on the bridge has been controlled by our army. The remnants of the enemy there have completely retreated to an area of six or seven hundred meters around East Broadway Road and have no combat capability, but they are still barely holding on due to the power of their superiors.</p>
<p>More Than a Dozen Defeated Enemy Soldiers Captured</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) A few days ago, our army launched a fierce attack on the Shuizha Road Jiangwan Road area and occupied the Patriotic Girls' School and Chizhi College. At that time, the artillery fire was fierce, and the enemy army responded in a panic, in a miserable state, with countless casualties. Defeated and unable to form an army, they hurriedly fled to the rear like fish caught in a net. More than a dozen enemy soldiers failed to escape and were captured by our army, disarmed, and it is learned that the prisoners have been escorted to the rear for disposal.</p>
<p>Enemy Artillery Indiscriminately Hits Our Customs Patrol Ship</p>
<p>Last night, after our air force attacked the enemy ships, the enemy ships fired indiscriminately. One shell hit the roof of the warehouse of the Jinliyuan Wharf on the 16th Pier, and another shell hit a customs patrol ship moored in front of the Jinliyuan Wharf on the 16th Pier, making a hole in the middle of the ship. The ship immediately flooded, and sailors and others on the ship rescued it. It is now being repaired this morning.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Bombs This Morning</h3>
<p>A Shell Hits the Maochang Cold Storage Factory, A Large Fire on Broadway Road</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) This morning, our air force once again went to the Huangpu River to bomb Japanese warships and buildings along the river to facilitate military operations. At around 8:00, three bombers circled high in the sky for a long time. The enemy warships fired their anti-aircraft guns together. Our planes flew down in the sound of artillery shells and dropped two shells in a row, one hitting the Maochang Cold Storage Factory and one hitting a certain house behind the North Warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau. In an instant, the fire was bright and burning fiercely. The enemy army also dispatched four seaplanes to engage our air force. Four enemy planes surrounded one of our planes, and both sides opened fire with machine guns. This morning, six planes from our air force continued to drop bombs on the enemy's last stronghold in the Yangshupu Road East Broadway Road area. It is reported that the houses near Shuntai Wharf and Nanyang Company caught fire and burned fiercely. The thick smoke was still obscuring the sky until noon. According to people who escaped from Huaji Road, most of the houses in the East Broadway Road area were burned down, and the stubborn enemy troops had nowhere to hide and were terrified.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, our army has been pressing forward victoriously on the east and west roads for several days. The enemy's positions are shrinking and have been divided into three sections, densely concentrated in Broadway Road and the bottom of Yangshupu, etc. Our army is still using air force bombing in the hope of annihilating them in one fell swoop. At 6:20 this morning, two of our planes appeared over the enemy positions in Hongkou, flying from west to east, circling several times in the enemy warships' anti-aircraft fire, and dropping several shells calmly, all of which hit. Several places caught fire. The two planes flew east. At around 9:00, one of our planes appeared in the air again. Before the enemy warships could detect it, the plane quickly swooped down and dropped several shells behind the China Merchants Bureau Central Warehouse. By the time the enemy warships sounded an alarm and fired their guns, our plane had already taken off and left. The Chinese and foreigners in the Huangpu River witnessed this active performance and praised it endlessly.</p>
<h3>Izumo Warship Moves East Again</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy flagship Izumo, since being bombed by us, has been moving its mooring location erratically day and night for the past few days. This morning, the ship first moved from north of Lujiazui, near buoys No. 2 and 3, to the middle of the Huangpu River, turning its hull around (originally, its bow faced west; now its bow faces east). At 11:08 AM, the ship suddenly started eastward, but because its propeller was damaged, it could not move quickly, sailing extremely slowly, almost like a clam crawling. By the time it reached the river area near Deng Tuo Road, it could no longer move. One of the enemy's torpedo boats, No. 1, has already been dispatched and anchored in front of the White Bridge Garden.</p>
<p>The enemy flagship "Izumo," moored at buoy No. 2 on the river near the Gonghexiang Wharf, has been heavily damaged due to repeated attacks by our army. As a result, most of its cannons are no longer capable of strong firing, and it can only use anti-aircraft machine guns to attack our air force. Moreover, during the large fires on both sides of the Huangpu River on the evening of the 19th, the ship felt that its situation was dangerous and retreated towards the Mitsubishi River area to moor.</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning's Aerial Battle: Enemy Guns Fired乱射</p>
<p>The enemy troops have suffered a series of disastrous defeats and are now sometimes using their air force to attack our rear, but to no effect. As their days dwindle and their situation becomes increasingly dire, enemy planes launched a nocturnal raid around 9 PM last night, circling over the skies of Nanshi and Zhabei, but were repelled by our artillery fire. At dawn this morning, large formations of our planes soared in the sky over the Huangpu River, planning to bomb enemy warships and positions. The enemy army responded with anti-aircraft guns. Around 7 AM, enemy planes also took off and circled around Longhua, Gaochang, and Ba. Our army was on high alert. The enemy planes circled for a long time but ultimately failed. Afterwards, one of our bomber planes and two fighter planes simultaneously attacked enemy positions. Anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns on enemy ships and on the roofs of certain buildings fired at our planes frequently. For a time, the sound of artillery in the air was very dense. Enemy planes then took to the air to intercept, and the machine guns on both sides fired as rapidly as linked beads. Our air force was exceptionally brave and maneuvered swiftly. Even under the enemy's combined attack from above and below, our air force showed no fear. The enemy army retreated in a small defeat, and our planes returned safely.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Shot Down in Zhabei and Nanshi</p>
<p>Around 7 AM this morning, several enemy planes came to various parts of Zhabei again, soaring high in the clouds. One plane, over the sky near Zhongshan Road's Tanjia Bridge, encountered two of our planes coming from the west. An aerial dogfight ensued immediately, with the planes circling each other several times. The enemy plane appeared to be trying to escape east, but then turned back and fired with its machine guns. Our planes also returned fire with machine guns. For a time, the rattling sound was heard far and wide. After about ten minutes of fighting, they flew off in different directions. At 8:25 AM, three more Japanese bombers came and were bombarded by our anti-aircraft guns. The booming sound was as dense as linked beads. The enemy planes then fled in panic.</p>
<p>Another report says that around 8 AM yesterday morning, two squadrons of enemy planes, three planes in each squadron, came to bomb our army's rear in Zhabei. They were bombarded by our garrison's anti-aircraft guns. One enemy plane was damaged and immediately crashed. This morning, according to villagers who escaped from the area, the plane crashed near the Zhongshan Bridge on Zhongshan Road. Because there was a bomb on board, it exploded immediately, completely destroying the plane's fuselage. The bridge was also slightly damaged.</p>
<p>When enemy planes dropped bombs in Nanshi yesterday, the 20th, one plane was hit by our defense force's machine guns. Because the damage was quite severe, it was forced to crash on the south bank of the Rihui Port near Xie Bridge. The pilot tried desperately to escape but was spotted by brave soldiers, who immediately captured him. He was escorted away along with the damaged plane.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Appear in Pudong, Nanshi, and Zhabei</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy planes have been dispatched continuously with the purpose of scouting our army's positions and destroying our transportation equipment and all facilities. However, because our defenses are tight, the enemy planes dare not fly low, so although they have dropped bombs, they have caused little damage to us. This morning, several enemy planes again dropped bombs in various places in Pudong, Nanshi, and Zhabei.</p>
<p>Reliable sources say that at 2:15 PM this afternoon, thirteen enemy planes went to areas around Kaibei, Jiangwan, and Dachang, as well as Pudong Tian Nanshi, to bomb.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Strafe Innocent Villagers</p>
<p>Around 8 AM this morning, one enemy plane, flying very high, circled over the western side of Bailong on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, scouting. It then descended and strafed with its machine guns. Along the road, in a place about a mile from Xinzhuang, a child of about eight or nine years old was hit by six bullets and died. An elderly woman in her fifties was shot in the left foot and injured.</p>

<h3>Brief Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>London dispatch. The issue of neutralizing Shanghai is being considered by the Chinese and Japanese governments. British diplomatic authorities have also consulted with the French and American governments in Paris and Washington, seeking cooperation. An observer says, "What is the reason for making demands on China? Where is the national prestige in making demands on Japan? Difficult, difficult, difficult."</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that a spokesman for the Consul-General stated that he denied reports of Japanese army troops arriving in Shanghai to participate in the war. He also said that as of noon on August 17, the number of Japanese officers and soldiers killed was less than thirty, and the number of wounded was about sixty. An observer says, "No one with even a little common sense would believe this. Even if you asked a six- or seven-year-old child, they probably wouldn't believe it either. Deceiving oneself? Deceiving others?"</p>
<p>British writer Mr. Mei wrote to the Continental Daily News on the 19th, asking the newspaper's reporters to forward a silver coin bank and a silver cigarette case that his mother had given him to the Chinese wounded soldiers' hospital. An observer says, "The same foreigners, one using planes, bombs, and artillery to enjoy our people, the other using cigarette cases and coin banks to enjoy our people. Why is that?"</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo dispatch. It is heard that the Japanese government will henceforth refer to the conflicts between China and Japan as "accidental Sino-Japanese incidents." The various expenses related to the Sino-Japanese incident will be covered by issuing bonds. An observer says, "Indeed, this is something that the Japanese did not expect. I think it would be more meaningful to change the assumption to 'Sino-Japanese explosion incident.'"</p>
<p>Last time was "September 18," this time is "August 19." The numbers are reversed. An observer says, "This is cause and effect. It is also a sign of stripping and restoration."</p>

<h3>Japan Still Unrepentant, Preparing for Long-Term War</h3>
<p>No Third-Party Intervention Allowed; British Mediation Plan Fails</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Political circles here believe that the unexpected resistance of Chinese troops in Shanghai is the theme of today's cabinet meeting. After the cabinet meeting, a short communique was issued, stating that the Japanese government is preparing for a long-term war. The cabinet has already discussed new bills to be submitted to parliament in early September to turn Japan's entire economic organization into a "wartime state." The communique also stated that the Army Minister and Navy Minister have reported to the cabinet on the battle situation in Shanghai and Nankou. (Maritime News Agency telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro today issued a statement to the press here, stating that the Japanese government has decided to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict by force, without allowing any third-party intervention. Konoe strongly stated that the Sino-Japanese problem can only be resolved by China and Japan themselves. Japan's goal is to eliminate all "anti-Japanese" elements and communist forces in North China and govern North China with close Japanese cooperation. This statement proves that the British mediation plan has failed. (Maritime News Agency telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the British government's proposal that Chinese and Japanese troops each withdraw from the vicinity of Shanghai in order to delineate a neutral zone, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has reportedly expressed its refusal to accept. Japanese sources here have explained that the Foreign Ministry's expression should be regarded as a firm rejection of the British proposal. If this proposal had been made in the middle of last week, the Japanese government might have accepted it, but as of today, there is no room for acceptance.

<h3>US Upheaval Over Enemy Shell Hitting US Warship</h3>
<p>Preparing to Lodge Representations with Japan; Neutrality Law Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>[Washington] After the flagship "Augusta" of the US Far East Fleet was hit by stray bullets in the Huangpu River in Shanghai, President Roosevelt told the press that the US authorities in Shanghai were better able to deal with the accidents that occurred there than the federal government authorities. The State Department and the Navy Department said that Rear Admiral Yarnell, commander of the Far East Fleet, enjoyed broad powers and would be able to take appropriate measures to make strong representations to the responsible parties regarding this accident. (Editor's note: The Japanese warship moored in the Huangpu River fired artillery at our Nanshi and Pudong areas on the evening of the 20th, and a shell hit the US warship "Augusta," killing one US soldier and wounding eighteen.) (Havas News Agency telegram, Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The news that the US flagship "Augusta" was hit by stray bullets, killing one sailor and wounding eighteen, has spread here, and all newspapers have published it in large print, causing an uproar throughout the country. Some members of Congress believe that the time has come for the United States to declare the Neutrality Act. US Navy Department personnel said that the commander of the Asian Fleet would soon lodge a strong protest with both China and Japan. President Roosevelt said that the US authorities in Shanghai could decide on their own to adopt whatever method they saw fit. When asked whether the US warships would retaliate, President Roosevelt said that such an event was almost unavoidable under such circumstances, and the application of the Neutrality Act would have to wait until China and Japan formally declared war. In addition, Secretary of State Hull considered the "Augusta" incident to be an "unfortunate incident." In addition, President Roosevelt's weekly cabinet meeting also had a detailed discussion of the "Augusta" incident. Afterwards, the president did not announce whether he had discussed taking any formal action, but one cabinet member said that there was still no decision on the Neutrality Act. According to another cabinet member, the official report received stated that the shell that hit the "Augusta" came from the Japanese side, but the source was not announced, only that the matter was discussed for a very long time. In addition, Representative McReynolds, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly advocated adopting the Neutrality Act. The "Augusta" incident was unfortunate, but he firmly believed that the president's suspension of the declaration of neutrality was the right approach. The United States should negotiate with both China and Japan on the one hand, but also knows that such bombardment was not intentional, and the application of the Neutrality Act should be deferred until the true situation is determined. (Reuters telegram, Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington correspondence. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese problem, the United States has been extremely indignant at Japan's aggressive behavior, unanimously opposed the implementation of the Neutrality Act, and some have advocated a special ban on the export of war materials to Japan. The Birmingham News recently published an editorial, stating that President Roosevelt is deeply concerned about the Sino-Japanese problem, as it may affect the United States and other countries in the world. The United States, as a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, guarantees the political and territorial integrity of China. The United States failed to take any action when Japan seized Manchuria in China before. Under the current situation, perhaps some measures can be taken, at least one step can be taken. The United States has seen the enthusiasm of Japan in purchasing scrap iron and steel from the United States in recent years, and realizes that Japan can use its low wages, one-tenth of those in the US, to manufacture munitions. The future is very dangerous. It is currently trying to ban the export of scrap iron and steel, etc. It can be seen that in the Sino-Japanese incident, justice is in people's hearts.

<h3>US Newspaper Comments on the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>Japan's Rampant Brutality Has Few Parallels in History</p>
<p>[Washington] The Washington Post today published an article on the Shanghai Incident, which stated that "Whether Japan wins or loses, this kind of inconceivable atrocity cannot justify itself. However, throughout history, there have always been great countries who are willing to disregard moral condemnation and sacrifice their national future in order to satisfy their desire for extreme aggression. But Japan's rampant brutality, disregarding the impact on world culture, has few parallels in history. Japan's weapons are strong, but they are not enough to resist the anger and hatred caused by its naked and undisguised barbarity." (Reuters telegram, Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] The London Economic News today carried an editorial stating that Japan's unbridled aggression has long since completely lost the world's sympathy. The newspaper supports the British government's demand for loss compensation, but said that the interruption of commerce, the magnitude of the loss, is not fully compensable. The newspaper further said that China's internal development in recent years has qualified it to receive a large amount of foreign investment, so when Japan was doing everything in Manchuria, Britain and others were providing China with various forms of assistance to consolidate its commercial relations. For example, the reform of China's financial system was largely due to the efforts of British government economic advisor Sir Otto Niemeyer, and the trade in gold and silver between China and the United States has also further consolidated China's economic position. Therefore, the integrity and independence of China in the future are of great importance to several major countries, not only related to moral principles.

<h3>Results of Nine Days of Resistance Prove Our Army Is Stronger Than the Enemy</h3>
<p>Japanese Air Force and Artillery Are Just So-So; Our Army's Artillery Skills Are Particularly Miraculous</p>
<p>The Shanghai war has been going on for nine days now. In these short nine days, the strength of our Chinese army has clearly been shown to be stronger than that of Japan. The Japanese army is timid and cowardly, unable to withstand a single blow. The reason why it has been able to sustain itself until now without being completely annihilated is only because of its weapons and defenses. The weakness of the Japanese air force's combat capabilities has been deeply understood by Chinese and foreign observers who have been watching the war in Shanghai for days. This can be proved by the fact that more than 30 Japanese planes have been shot down by our army in the initial clashes with our air force. When Japanese planes are dispatched, they are afraid of being hit by our anti-aircraft guns, so they fly high in the clouds and dare not swoop down, resulting in indiscriminate bombing. There was an incident on the 20th of accidentally bombing the Toyota Cotton Mill, which has become a laughing stock to the world. As for the Japanese army's artillery, after our army tightly surrounded the Japanese army's positions, it has completely lost its effectiveness. Although the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River fire from time to time, their technology is immature and they have no confidence. Not only does this not cause us any damage, but Japan even hit the US flagship "Augusta" on the 20th. The strength of the Japanese army can be seen from this. On the contrary, our army's morale is high and they are extremely loyal and brave, with a great momentum of being able to conquer every attack and win every battle. Since the war began nine days ago, the Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties and even greater losses. Our country's air force has high technology and fights bravely, displaying its power in famous places in Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, and Anhui for days, deeply fearing the Japanese army. Our army's artillery skills are particularly miraculous. The artillery that is fighting in Shanghai this time is the most elite artillery that is famous throughout the country. The most miraculous artilleryman in the country with shooting skills, □□□, is subordinate to it and participated in the battle. For days, our army has fired artillery to bombard the Japanese army's positions and the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>The artillery fire is fierce and the targets are accurate. The Japanese army has suffered heavy losses and is in a state of embarrassment. Our army possesses several of the newest type of giant cannons with a □□ diameter. When the Japanese army received this gift from our army, they inspected the shrapnel and were terrified. This is because the Japanese army did not know that our army possessed this newest type of weapon. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Two or Three Hundred Enemy Corpses Shipped to Japan</h3>
<p>It is reported that a warship with a 100-meter-long gunboat berthed at the Mitsubishi Wharf secretly sailed out of the Wusongkou late last night, carrying a large number of enemy corpses, numbering over two or three hundred.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Disarmed and Escorted to British Barracks</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Enemy Soldiers Escorted to the Racecourse</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday afternoon around 3 PM, the enemy retreated southwest after being pursued by our army in the Hongkou area. It is said that a portion of the enemy soldiers fled across the Waibaidu Bridge and were disarmed. This morning, the reporter made many inquiries to relevant parties. According to eyewitnesses, about seventy enemy soldiers did flee from Hongkou, crossed the Waibaidu Bridge, and fled south. They were immediately disarmed, and British soldiers escorted them onto two cars, passed the Bund and headed to Nanjing Road. More than ten enemy soldiers got off at the racecourse and entered it. The remaining enemy soldiers were said to have been imprisoned in the British barracks on Gordon Road.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Movement of British, American, and French Warships</h3>
<p>Another American Warship Enters the Huangpu River</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, today (the 21st) morning, not only were the various factory ships berthed in the river frequently moved, but the warships of friendly nations were also busy coming and going. From 8 AM this morning, two warships each from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom have been successively passing the Jianghaiguan Wharf from the Bund area outside Fada Road, heading towards Wusongkou. It is not known whether this move is to accept our notice that foreign warships should be five nautical miles away from enemy warships, but at about 11 AM, another US destroyer No. 9 sailed in from Wusongkou and is now berthed in the Tai Zhan Wharf area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Berthed in the River Move Busily</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the busiest movement of Japanese warships berthed in Shanghai was last night and this morning. Just taking the river area near the Waibaidu Bridge, around 8 PM last night, a small Japanese gunboat sailed to the Bund Park river surface to protect the enemy flagship Izumo berthed at the opposite buoy No. 2 of the Gonghexiang Wharf. The Izumo flagship, after being bombed by our explosive device and moved there for repairs, seems to have been repaired today. At about 9 AM, it slowly sailed inwards, to the China Merchants Bureau Central Wharf river surface, where it stopped. Around 11 AM, it slowly sailed out again, and berthed at the buoy No. 2 again. This seems to be to try sailing after the repairs, in order to inspect its machinery. At 11:10 AM, a small enemy gunboat berthed on the Bund Park river surface sailed to the Nanjing Road Bund river surface. By noon, the ship was still berthed there.</p>
<h3>Banks Donate to National Salvation</h3>

Your businesses play a significant role in regulating the economy for ordinary people. It is hoped that you will quickly discuss and determine restrictions and reopen immediately. This is what we sincerely hope for."</p>
<h3>Admirable Brave Soldiers Continued Fighting Despite Injuries</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter visited a certain rear hospital and personally witnessed two brave soldiers of our side. One was a machine gunner who was wounded in the left arm by a bullet. The doctor applied medicine and bandages and ordered him to be hospitalized temporarily. However, the soldier refused and insisted on being discharged immediately to return to the front. The doctor feared that the wound would become inflamed and fester and urged him to stay in the hospital for three days, but the soldier refused again, saying, "I am a machine gunner, and I only use my right hand. My left hand is of no use at all." He left without saying goodbye. His bravery was unprecedented. Another soldier was ordered to charge a certain enemy position. At that time, he disregarded his own safety and charged fiercely towards the enemy position. The enemy troops immediately strafed with machine guns. The soldier was hit by three volleys of bullets, a total of thirty-nine bullets. However, he endured the pain and attacked fiercely, finally breaking into the enemy position and reaching his destination, resulting in the occupation of the enemy position. Afterwards, he was rescued by the rescue team and sent to the hospital for treatment. His spirit of resisting the enemy and defending the country, regarding death as returning home, is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Letter to Banking and Money Exchange Industries Urging Release of Subsidiary Currency to Stabilize Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the financial community in the city has now reopened and the economy is gradually stabilizing. However, there is still a lack of subsidiary currency, and the exchange rate has not yet recovered. The Chamber has sent separate letters to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the money exchange and tobacco exchange trade associations, urging them to find ways to handle the situation. The original letter is as follows: ㊀ Regarding the matter of reopening, since the outbreak of the war, the subsidiary currency and legal tender circulating in the city, especially one-cent or one-yuan denominations, are the most scarce. If five yuan or ten yuan of legal tender are exchanged for one yuan, it requires at least a 10% discount. If one yuan of legal tender is exchanged for one cent or one cent of subsidiary currency, it requires at least another 5% discount. This has a significant impact on the currency system and the livelihood of the people. The Chamber has repeatedly received complaints from merchants and residents. We urge your bank to immediately find a way to increase the issuance of one-yuan legal tender and one-cent subsidiary currency to facilitate circulation and provide relief. This is what we sincerely hope for. This letter is addressed to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China. ㊁ Regarding the matter of reopening, the handling fees that money exchange businesses and tobacco exchange businesses should charge for exchanging one yuan of legal tender and subsidiary currency were originally negotiated and set by the industry and had limited scope for variability. Since the outbreak of the war, some stores have been exchanging one yuan for only eighty cents or eighty-four cents. Such exploitation of the crisis is not only infuriating to the public but also violates the law. Your association should strictly prohibit this, conduct regular inspections, and severely punish those found to be doing so, or report them to the authorities. This is what is essential. This letter is addressed to the Money Exchange and Tobacco Exchange Trade Associations.</p>
<h3>Food Regulation Association Lowers Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Public Sales Offices Also Set Up in Nanshi and Zhabei</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Food Regulation Association, it has worked very hard on matters such as unblocking sources of supply and distributing and selling rice, with remarkable results. The original maximum price was not to exceed fifteen yuan per dan. Today, as a result of the association's efforts, the maximum price per dan was reduced to fourteen yuan and a half. It is said that further reductions will be sought in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing forty-four rice sales offices in the concession area to supply food to the residents of the concession, the committee is also preparing to set up temporary public rice and grain sales offices in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts, selling at market prices. It is planned to set up ten locations in Nanshi and eight in Zhabei to prevent panic among residents in dangerous areas and to ensure the supply of food to the soldiers fighting on the front lines. The Food Regulation Association decided to hold a group meeting at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss everything and then immediately prepare for establishment. As for Pudong, plans are also underway to establish offices there, so that food can be fully regulated and supplied.</p>
<h3>Increase in Vehicles on All Routes in the Concessions</h3>
<p>Since shops and companies in the Public Concession and the French Concession have gradually resumed business, the market has become more stable. The Public Concession Tram Company will start operating all tram routes in the concession as usual from 8:00 a.m. this morning, with more than thirty trams running. Double-decker buses have also started running, traveling back and forth from Jing'an Temple to the Bund on Nanjing Road. In the French Concession, trams and trolleybuses on all routes have gradually resumed operation in safe areas.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Shanghai Branch Trade Union Sends Condolences to Front-Line Soldiers</h3>
<p>Shanghai Shenbao transferred to Commander Zhang Wenboxun: The enemy Japanese are provoking and harassing Shanghai again. Our army soldiers are loyally and bravely performing their duties and rising up to resist the war, achieving great feats repeatedly. Our air force is brave, mighty, and divine, thwarting the enemy's attacks repeatedly. The enemy's courage has been chilled, and the enemy's momentum is becoming increasingly depressed. Good news is frequently heard, which is very gratifying. Our association respectfully leads its 80,000 seamen to send condolences and pay tribute. We also hope that you will overcome the enemy and achieve complete success as soon as possible. Our association vows to do its utmost to be your rear support. We hope that you will give us your attention. Respectfully from Peng Bowei, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union, and all committee members and staff.</p>
<h3>Customs Notice: Confucius' Birthday Holiday</h3>
<p>And a Ban on Rosin Exports</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department has now moved from the Jiang'an Bund to the General Inspectorate Office on the ground floor of the new Customs building. Today, Customs Commissioner Rhode issued two notices: ㊀ According to government regulations, August 17th is the anniversary of Confucius' birthday and should be a holiday. This Customs will comply and close on that day (Friday). All merchants are hereby notified. ㊁ By order of the Ministry of Finance, the export of rosin to foreign countries and Dalian in Dong Province is temporarily prohibited. All merchants are hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Refugees Return Home on the Ningyu This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Flying the Municipal Council Flag</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing of the Ningbo Native Place Association planned to send Ningbo refugees away from Shanghai. The first batch was decided to be transported on four ships, which could carry about 16,000 people. The first ship, the British ship Shenfu, has already been chartered and carried 2,500 people yesterday. The second ship is the Sanbei's Ningyu. Mr. Yu negotiated with the Municipal Council and obtained their consent. The Ningyu changed to fly the Municipal Council flag so that it could safely leave the port without obstruction. The ship arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo this morning and is scheduled to depart from the Jinliyuan Wharf at 10:30 a.m., carrying a total of 5,000 refugees. Tomorrow, the third ship will be transported by the Xin Ning Shao. It will also use the Municipal Council flag to leave the port. The fourth ship is an Italian ship, scheduled to leave on the 23rd. The Municipal Council has notified the Japanese Navy not to obstruct it when passing through the Songkou.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of This Morning's On-Site Inspection</h3>
<p>Verified information: This morning, a little after 8:00 a.m., some people wanted to inspect the war situation on Nanjing Road and the Bund, but they were unable to go out due to police obstruction. They then took Sichuan Road south to Aisamaria Road and turned east. When they got to the European War Memorial, they looked east and saw thick smoke filling the area north of the Bund, rising straight into the sky. Looking north, outside the Waibaidu Bridge, only another Japanese warship was docked where the Izumo used to be. On the Bund outside the French Concession, pedestrians were walking back and forth as usual, but there were fewer of them. On the Bund of the Public Concession, no one was allowed to enter or leave freely unless they had a job or possessed credentials from the owner of a number there. Then they went north on Sichuan Road, turned west on Suzhou Road, and crossed the Waterworks Bridge on Jiangxi Road. At the corner of Tian Road, British soldiers had piled up sandbags, but there were no troops stationed there. Looking east from here, the New Asia Restaurant showed no signs of people entering or leaving. Japanese soldiers were patrolling with guns on Chongming Road. When Chinese merchants entered or left, the Japanese soldiers forced them to kneel on the ground with their hands behind their backs to humiliate them. On Wenchang Street, many layabouts were prying open doors of houses and stealing things. After stealing them, the layabouts gathered together to grab them. There were also many hooligans waiting with sticks on North Jiangxi Road between Chongming Road and Wenchang Street. When they saw the layabouts stealing things, they would also rob them. As the saying goes, "a robber meets his match," it was extremely chaotic. Also, a certain cigarette and paper shop at the corner of Hainan Road and North Jiangxi Road was set on fire by layabouts last night and then looted. It was still being dug up this morning.</p>
<p>This morning, newspapers reported that the enemy troops had retreated to North Henan Road and that small cannons and machine guns were installed on the Xiaocai Market there. This has been verified to be inaccurate. In order to thoroughly understand the situation in that section, this reporter went to the Hainan Road Huisi police station at 9:30 a.m. and asked about it. According to the police officer at the police station, the Japanese army is now retreating to the North Sichuan Road area and has not invaded the area west of North Jiangxi Road. This reporter then went to North Henan Road to inspect and saw that it was still guarded by British and American vehicle teams. There were no weapons installed on the roof of the Xiaocai Market. Although all the shops on the road were closed, pedestrians had not stopped, and they were very calm. Five trucks full of sandbags were parked at the intersection of Henan Road and Path 10. The British and American defense forces stationed there were busy transporting the sandbags to add to the existing defenses. There was also a similar situation at the iron gate on North Zhejiang Road near Eyre.</p>
<p>This morning, a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency went to Sichuan Road Bridge to inspect. Traffic was completely cut off on both the north and south banks. From the Suzhou River, one could see that there were more than a dozen Japanese soldiers stationed in front of the General Post Office at the northern end of the Sichuan Road Bridge. No one was to be seen on North Sichuan Road, presenting a completely desolate scene. Further along the riverbank to the north bank of Zhajhong Road Bridge, more Japanese soldiers were stationed. There were many Japanese soldiers at the intersection of Zhapu Road and Datong Road. The reporter originally planned to go along the river to the Wai Bai Du Bridge and then to the Bund. At that time, the sound of gunfire was faint on the north bank, and the Japanese army was moving frequently. Traffic could not proceed further, so he turned into Yuanmingyuan Road and returned. On the way, he met a couple who had escaped from Shanlihong Bridge. According to the man, our forward posts were only fifty or sixty meters away from Lihong Bridge, so there were no enemy troops at the eastern end of the bridge. We came from Huade Road over the Waibaidu Bridge. At the western end of the Lihong Bridge, the intersection of Wenchang Street, Hanhang Road, and Tiantong Road, there were large numbers of enemy troops stationed in barbed wire and sandbags. My wife was stabbed in the head at the intersection of Hanhang Road by enemy soldiers.</p>
<h3>Three People Suspected of Being Traitors Arrested</h3>
<p>Tang and Wang Led No Fewer Than Several Hundred Traitors</p>
<p>Detectives Han Cuisun, Du Wenyuan, and Zhang Sen of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau were patrolling the border between the French Concession and Xujiahui at noon yesterday when they saw a suspicious person by the roadside. They went forward to search him and found a white toothbrush and a black and white toothbrush on his body. However, they observed that his teeth seemed to not have been brushed for several years. What use did he have for two toothbrushes? They brought him to the bureau. Under questioning, he confessed that his name was Yin Agen, and that he was from Hangzhou and had worked as a stonemason for the Japanese company Mitsui Yoko-owned Zhabei Pushan and Cuilin Stone Works. Since the Shanghai war, he had been unemployed. Later, he was secretly ordered by Tang Yu, a foreman from Ningbo, and Wang Xiuzhang, a worker from Ningbo, to act as a traitor, responsible for putting poison into teacups on roadsides in the concessions and Chinese areas to disrupt the rear of our army and disturb the people's hearts. He was paid one yuan per day. The two toothbrushes were the secret sign. He also revealed the addresses of Tang and Wang and said that those two people commanded no fewer than several hundred traitors. The detectives obtained the confession, then took Yin to the Xinzha police station and, together with Chinese detectives Tang Yungan and Wang Shidong, arrested Tang at No. 84 Hengji Lane on Gordon Road and Wang at the Nanxing Teahouse on Changde Road No. 8. Yin identified them correctly. This morning, they were escorted to the Shangyi Branch of the Court. Chief Justice Yu Huating, Judge Xiao Ji, and Prosecutor Lin Wopeng took the bench for questioning. Gan Jingxian, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, did not fully agree with the transfer. Prosecutor Lin also advocated that they should be transferred to the police bureau for questioning. The two suspects, Tang and Wang, completely denied the allegations. Chief Justice Yu then determined that the two suspects, Tang and Wang, should be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Mao Heyuan Talks About Sending Refugees</h3>
<p>Sustenance is Difficult, Sending Them Away is the Only Option, the Municipal Council Helped so it Could be Carried Out</p>
<p>Yu Zhiqin, Chairman of the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, has negotiated with the Municipal Council through the Consular Body for protection in transporting refugees out of the country, and consulted the Sanbei Ning Shao companies to send ships to handle the matter. To understand the situation, this reporter visited Mr. Mao Heyuan, who is in charge of the rescue work of the Association, who said: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, residents in Zhabei and Hongkou have fled to the Concession. Our Association, in accordance with its natural responsibilities, has successively established eight shelters, accommodating a total of 15,000 refugees. Over one hundred dan of rice are required daily for food alone. If we consider all the refugees accommodated by the various charities in Shanghai, there are no fewer than hundreds of thousands. It would be difficult to provide for them without sending them away. However, all sea transportation has been stopped, and land transportation is intermittent. Yu Qiaqing was the first to worry about this. After many efforts, he was supported by the Municipal Council to petition the consuls to allow protection. Ships dispatched by Sanbei Ning Shao to transport refugees out of the country will be given safety. The Association has experienced considerable financial difficulties in this undertaking of taking in refugees. After several meetings, a solution was found among the unavoidable measures. That is, those who are wealthy and wish to purchase tickets to leave the country must first donate money to the Association and purchase tickets with the receipt. As for the ticket prices of the Sanbei Ning Shao companies, they are still sold at the previous prices and are not increased. The donations collected by the Association will all be used to provide relief to poor refugees and for their repatriation.</p>
<h3>Shell Landed in Pubo Lane, French Concession, This Morning</h3>
<p>Fortunately No One Was Injured</p>
<p>At around 7:00 a.m. today, a shell suddenly flew into No. 116 Pubo Lane on Rue Lubin in the French Concession. It pierced through the sun deck and fell directly into the third-floor attic, destroying a radio receiver. At the time, there was a bed next to where the shell fell. Fortunately, the person in bed was not injured. Afterwards, it was inspected. The shell weighed about three or four pounds and has been sent to the Samsung Company in charge of the area for safekeeping.</p>
