<h3>日兩無產政黨合併交涉决裂（上）</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>㊀交涉的經過</p>
<p>去年十一月十八日，本報會介紹过“日本人民戰綫和社大黨。”那正是勞農無産協議會（以後簡稱勞協）與社大黨進行合併交涉的時候。現在這一交涉，宣告决裂了，也就是，社大黨明白表示拒絕人民戰綫運動了。（據最近的東京都新聞，讀賣新聞，及其他雜誌。）</p>
<p>發起這一合併運動的是勞協。合併的目的，在結成反法西的無產戰綫統一運動。負責拉攏社大和勞協的，是全國水平社及全國農民組合的兩首領：松本治一郎和黑田壽男。合併交涉，前後經四個月。</p>
<p>堅决反對這一合併的，是社大黨的書記長麻生久，及支持社大黨的全日本勞動同盟會長松岡駒吉（都新聞。）反對的理由是：㊀不承認勞協爲合併的對象：㊁社大黨與勞協首領加籐勘十（以後簡稱加籐）的政見不同（讀賣新聞。）</p>
<p>交涉决裂，這是各方面都承認的了。决裂後，又怎樣呢？這却有兩種不同的記載：其一，在兩陣营（社大和勞協）的下層份子中，合併空氣已經很濃厚了，所以關於合併一事，松本及黑田巳聯名請求社大黨的黨魁安部磯雄，再開談判了（都新開；）其二，勞協方面，認爲交涉决裂，正是组織新政黨的機會，現已開始活潑的運動，凖在一月中遊説全國，二月卽開新政黨結成的全國大會（讓賣新聞——一月八日。）！此兩種記載雖不同，但在勞協不放棄人民戰綫運動這一點上，是一致的。</p>
<p>㊁决裂原因的檢討</p>
<p>所謂“不承認勞協爲合併的對象，”用社大黨的話來解釋，卽是：“入黨時，必須以個人資格，加入所屬支部。”勞協乃是一個團體，并非個人，所以不承認勞協爲合併的對象。所謂“與加籐政見不同”卽是：加籐認爲現日本的客觀情勢中，已具有人民戰綫結成的各種絛件。社大黨却否認此等條件的存在，同時也就是否定人民戰綫的前途。</p>
<p>勞協是在去年秋季繼開始結成的。加籐不願以個人資格加入社大黨，只願以團體資格加入，這是很顯明的。加籐所持的理由：第一是：爲要“刺激社大黨內的反法西派的能動性，打破社大黨內的法西派的錯覺，“在社大黨外建立批制社大黨的勢力，這是必要的。將此批判的勢力統一起來，在促成合併運動上也是絕對必要的。要使社大黨眞的成爲人民戰綫的中心勢力，只有先將社大黨外諸勢力結爲一個團體，然後用此團體加入，這才能實現。第二是：在合併交涉未成功以前，也當有組織的，不斷的展開反法西運動。—這便是組織勞協的原因（“向人民戰綫去的一條路”—加籐作，載中央公論九月號。）</p>
<p>然而，加藤的理由，在社大黨方面，尤其是麻生派看來，恰恰是相反的。</p>
<p>加籐説：“打破社大黨內的法西派的錯覺。”這實際上，卽是打破麻生久一派的錯覺。麻生久與軍部的關係，麻生久在社大黨內擁有較大的勢力，這都是很明白的事寶。在加籐未能分化麻生派以前，一面呌着打破麻生久的錯覺，一面又在要求加入社大黨，這當然要遭社大黨書記長麻生久的拒絕了。</p>
<p>麻生久和加籐，是同一時期（一九一七年）加入勞動運動的。在一九三二年以前，麻生久與加籐常同屬於一種團體，在組織地位上，麻生久當在加籐以上。一九三二年起社大黨結成後，加籐認社大黨爲法西團體，這才越來越對立了。一九三六年的競選，雖然兩人得票均在五萬以上，但在一切議員中，得票最多的要算加籐。麻生久越來越嫉視加籐，這當是毫無疑義的·至人民戰綫潮波及日本以後，加籐又抓緊人民戰綫這一口號來號召，并且要求社大黨接受人民戰綫的網領，麻生久當然更憂慮他自己的領導地位發生動搖了然而，這分明是一種宗派主義和排外主義的固執。</p>
<p>除兩人間—兩種社會力量—的矛盾成爲决裂原因外，還可以指出社大黨與勞協對於人民戰綫的幾個不同的基本見解。</p>
<p>㊀“在今天，那種條件（結成人民戰綫的條件）還沒有，……。”）這是麻生久在“人民戰綫呢國民戰綫呢？”的座談會上講過的—日本評論九月號）㊁現政府—軍部—金融資本家對於人民戰綫運動的強壓，早在麻生派的想像中了，所以他們説：“結成人民戰錢，反而刺激了政府，使政府得到彈壓勞動運動的口實。”社大黨不敢從鬥爭中發展勞動運動，只𩕮在偸安的和平態度下企圖發展，這已是很明白的了。</p>
<p>此外，社大黨還正做着議會鬥爭的夢。這夢，現在確很甜。去年總選的結果，曾表示了無產派的一大躍進。尤其是社大黨的議員，增加到十八名了，而社大黨以外的無産各派，只不過共得六席。社大黨正夢想着以後的議會躍進，很怕人民戰綫把自己的美夢驚醒。</p>
<p>口裏呌着社會主義，左手拉着一部份勤勞大衆，右手却不便拒绝實力派的法西，這是今日的社大黨。</p>
<p>口裹喊着人民戰綫，但手裏拉着的動勞大眾還太少，這是今日的勞協。</p>
<p>能將社大黨及勞協合併的，只有勤勞大衆的本身。</p>
<p>㊂勸勞大衆與社大</p>
<p>及勞協的關係</p>
<p>一九三五年（一九三六年的勞動統計尚未見到）日本勞動者總數，共五百九十萬六千五百八十九人。有組織的工人總數，共四十萬八千六百六十二人。卽：有組織的勢動者只佔工人總數之百分之六·九（據日本內務省社會局之調查。）這就夠説明日本工人的組織力，還未充分發展了。</p>
<p>但，這四十萬餘有組織的工人，並不完全團結在一二政黨之下。勞動者團體共九百九十三個。其中，支持社大黨及勞協者，又只不過一部份。</p>
<p>支持社大黨的勞動團體，有：官業勞動總同盟，日本海員組合，全日本勞動總同盟，海員協會，日本農民總同盟，日本港灣從業員組合，東電從業員組合，日本製鐵從業員組合，日本製陶勞動組合同盟，及東京瓦斯工組合等。支持勞協的，有：日本勞動組合全國評議會，全國農民組合，北日本農民組合，東京市從業員組合，及東京交通勞動總聯盟等。</p>
<p>這些勞動組織中，有支持社大黨同時也支特勞協的，如全國農民組合及東京從業員組合卽是。總言之，在上述團體中，表示支持社大黨者，約佔十分之八。支持勞協者，約佔十分之二。</p>
<p>此外的勞動團體，帶有法西性質的正不少，如:忠孝勞動組合，新日本海員組合，東電愛國同盟，及大日本勞動組合協議會等。</p>
<p>若社大黨能與勞協進行統一戰綫，據已有的勞動組織，再到未組織的工人羣眾（佔日本工人總數百分之九十二·一）中努力活動，那末，前途是無限的。在日本法西勢力正高漲的今日，社大黨與勞協的敵對尖銳，反法西的勢力當然是被削弱了。社大黨內也存在着反法西的羣眾，這是無疑的。在去年競選時，社大黨的口號中，曾有一個“反法西。”這一口號，與社大黨議席躍進的關系是很大的。加籐得票最多的理由，更是由於他的反法西的宣傳。</p>
<p>所謂“愛國勞動戰錢統一運動，一在一九三五年便已具體化了。但是，反法西的勞動戰綫統一運動，却未見進展。這除了種種客觀原因外，領袖間的宗派主義，也確是一個大障碍。</p>

<h3>陝局之波折與斡旋</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>震爍一時之陝甘問題最近乃有急轉直下之勢中央方面旣一再聲明以寬大爲懷。張楊部隊亦已遵令陸續撤退。時局之陰霾漸揭。人民之喘息甫定。方期循序平進。一無撓阻。何意魚龍曼衍。又呈變化。西安之城門盡閉。肘腋之槍聲突起。使却餘蒼生。又受一度之驚惶。垂成之議。幾遭意外之頓挫。夫豈常人始料所能及者。雖此項事變。旋卽壓平。西安秩序。已告恢復。然而人心之机陧未消。迥瀾之蘊伏猶在。蓋自陝變發生。以至今日。一波三折。迄難就緒。甚矣收拾善後問題之未易措手也。</p>
<p>此次西安內訌。眞相猶未甚明。據聞由於張部軍官中之激烈分子。不滿和平解决之條件。欲藉脅迫手段取得高級將領之承諾。以繼續對抗中央之態度。經各高級將領嚴詞拒絕。暴動遂以發生。東北軍六十七軍軍長王以哲。竟被戕殺。副官處長宋學禮等三人。並死非命。後經楊虎城于學忠等竭力鎮壓勸告。而其他部隊。憤王被殺。亦多起與爲難。暴動分子始向城外退去。亂事乃得漸歸平靖。此事雖與中央辦理善後。不生直接關係。惟當國難殷亟之今日。正賴集中全力以用命。不幸遭逢意外。又兆分化之局。使一部實力。平白脫難。垂隳元氣。重蒙打擊。而英勇善戰如王以哲者。未赴疆場之危。先罹伏屍之凶。要亦是國家一筆重大之損失。任何人有不爲之摧懷悒悒者乎。</p>
<p>事變之條然而作。忽焉而平。一方以見激份子行動之偏進。一方亦見明白事理者。仍復大有人在。而其最大推動之力量。無形斡旋之權衡。猶當歸功於舉國一致之集體意志。蓋集體意志之要求。爲團結。爲和平。無論何種勢力之抬頭。在對外目標未曾放鬆之前。斷不容再演破壞和平之事實。有分散團結之行動。結果殆未有不屈服於此集體意志之下者。不然。以張楊部隊平日紀律之廢弛混亂局而旣已惹起前途糜爛甯有紀極面卒能於短時期內使就消弭者。非此和平團結之集體意志有以左右之乎。今回之事然。已往之演變亦然集體意志之力量未摧國運之剝復庶共有豸。</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>美國加州大學聯籃球隊昨晚過滬表演</h3>
<p>四十比念八分勝上海混合隊　美隊動作敏速合作純熱可觀</p>
<p>美國加州大學聊籃球隊、應邀赴菲島表演、昨日過滬返美、本埠西文大陸報體育新聞部、特邀其作表演一次、並組織中西混合隊、作晚在申園與之對抗、全局比賽、形勢緊張異常下半時中、比數平等、凡四次之多、其情可見直至最後三分、急轉直下、美國隊連得十二分之多、遂以四十比二十八戰勝上海混合隊、上半時十八比十五、明星隊僅佔先三分、雙方表演、各有獨到、精彩非凡、該隊今日搭原輸秩父丸赴日轉美、</p>
<p>客隊顏色</p>
<p>加大隊之戰法、上海之麥令彷佛、動作敏速異常、到達對方籃前時五人之動作、遂如一座合拍純熱之機器、覓隙而入、射擲藍下居多、甚少遠射、皆單手一揮、隨之而中、惜乎射籃尚有不少欠缺準確、或亦因塲地生疏初臨客地之故、中鋒霍威爾、身長六呎餘、並不如何特色、兩鋒勃郎甯與墨斯、則活動可怕、該隊技術、一言以蔽之、動作敏速合作純熟而已、</p>
<p>滬隊甚佳</p>
<p>上海混合隊邀請李震中尹鴻祥來滬助戰、直至賽前數分鐘才趕到、上海之混合隊、亦全係明星、上半時中、以缺欠合作、屢屢不能得手、前鋒之中、尤嫌美中不足、洛克太呆、馮念華太矮、其餘李震中史規亞尹鴻祥卡遜四人之各個球藝、較之美隊、並不若何遜色、李尹卡三人、表演尤為獨到、其能予對方以四次平手者、其爭鬥之猛烈、可以想見、如加以純熟之合作、戰勝美隊、大有希望</p>
<p>祇差三分</p>
<p>李震中之跳球、並不弱於對方之長人、開賽後、尹鴻祥首得擲球機會、惜乎未中、墨斯犯規、尹首先罰中、打開紀綠、如是者數分鐘、俱未得手美隊叫停休息後、李震中又加二分、滬隊頓以三比零先聲奪人、戰局潮趨緊張、美隊似乎並不得手、雙方相去、每僅一二分二三分、滬隊落後極微、美隊以惠狄司加入替中鋒霍威爾、滬隊亦以史規亞代替洛克、上半時結束、美隊僅以十八比十五佔先三分而已、</p>
<p>四次平手</p>
<p>下半時起、洛克入代馮念華、霍戚爾再出任對方中鋒、雙方犯規累累、各以罰球得分、卡遜李震中連得罰球三分、滬隊遂首次造成各十八之平等紀錄、雙方表演、俱入佳境、各十八、各二十、以至各二十六、形勞極度緊張之至、此時尹鴻祥得罰對方隊長勃郎甯之機會、不料兩罰兩失異常可惜、反被勃郎甯單手一揮而中、美隊又以二十八比二十六多二分、卡遜獲中、又成平手、時距終結僅三分鐘、美國除雄威突發、勃郎甯霍威爾連連得分、其勢遂不可收拾滬隊連失十二分、以二十八比四十敗北、</p>
<h3>馬尼拉之戰情</h3>
<p>（本報駐菲記者顏文初寄）</p>
<p>（馬尼拉特信）全菲體育協會、為欲增進菲島籃球隊觀摩起見、特請美國南加州大學校友籃球隊來岷埠作八塲比賽、該球隊應聘而來、一行八人、於正月十一日抵岷、除一人爲羅瓦州大學藍球選手外、餘均爲加州大學選手、但皆未曾出席此次世運者、其體格魅梧奇偉、最高者六尺一寸、最低者五尺九寸其重量最重者一九加磅、最低者一六五磅誠非東方人所得與比肩、其後衛一躍起手幾可及籃、比賽結果七勝一敗、其敗也祇一分之差、亦堪説爲全操勝着、其比賽每塲結果分述如下、</p>
<p>總統接見</p>
<p>到岷之日、卽直任總統府拜謁菲總統奎松適政躬不適、由秘書長出爲招待、奎松總統於十二日上午另予接見、對該球隊長途跋涉慰勞有加、下榻於駐菲美國海陸軍青年會、體育協會竭誠任招待之責、</p>
<p>球藝變幻</p>
<p>第一塲比賽時、輕寫素描、全不着力、看眾大爲不滿、以似此傳接迂緩、必大挫於菲隊、果然第二場對全菲籃球亞軍仙迷撈大學隊以分之差打敗仗、普通觀眾更大失所望、至第三場出馬者為全菲籃球冠軍、素負鐵軍盛名之仙道馬大學隊菲島出席本屆世運卽以該隊選手爲基本、是夜觀眾特別增多在未開球一點半以前、各等坐位皆滿、有千餘人不得其門而入、此回觀眾心理、卽欲觀仙道罵各隊員、大展好身手、殺得此魁梧奇偉徒負雄大之美國隊、片甲不回、但事實上更出人意外、是夜美國隊、亦以生死關頭、盛譽攸關改變戰略全以傳遞緊逼投籃確準制勝、以仙道馬隊力竭聲嘶、加以全塲菲眾吶喊助威終無法挽回敗着矣</p>
<p>觀眾擁擠</p>
<p>旣打敗霸王仙道馬隊、球迷更興高彩烈、故弟四五六七等塲、座位皆先預定蓋誠黎撒籃球運動塲、祇容觀眾八千餘人、分一元五角、一元二角八角、四角四等、首次兩等座位、有號數可以豫定、三四兩等、則隨到隨坐、因第三四塲有人滿之患後至者向隅、故後來在開塲三點鐘前、卽帶面包充饑以佔坐位者、塲中更廣設佈音樓、一分之勝負、皆佈告於外、使不得其門而入者、亦略知戰塲中狀況、慰情聊勝於空跑一塲也、</p>
<p>觀眾胡鬧</p>
<p>菲人觀球戰、全在爲彼方摔塲、不知尊重客軍歷來我國球隊出征菲島，恒留不良印象者卽由菲人觀眾好爲無理之叫器、引起華僑觀眾不平、而與之爭鬧也、此回亦欲以無理譏笑、使美隊憤火中燒、而亂其陣勢、在第七回與世運隊比塞時、菲球證罰菲隊一球、觀眾大嘩、羣置其不公道、以菓子壳雜物拋擲塲中、如蝴蝶亂飛、警察亦啼笑皆非、無法制止、逼得美隊幾欲卽時離塲、中止比賽、幸體育協會當局出爲解釋一切、始再繼續終塲、至第八場比賽至第二節終、菲隊佔上風四分、觀眾狂歡、幾於震破牆壁、以為可雪恥報復、不料美隊沉着應戰、山驚人絕技、終於反敗為勝、使數千菲眾大為垂頭喪氣也、</p>
<p>菲方收入</p>
<p>此回美球隊來回費用僅訂約八千菲幣、計八塲可收近三萬金、體育協會、此次贏餘、大有可觀</p>

<h3>業餘擊彈甲組賽朱其良獲錦標</h3>
<p>結果二千分比一九六一分　張英達一再奮鬥終歸失敗</p>
<p>朱其良馮其鎮定精神、謹慎手法、卒勝張英達於最後極緊張之局面中先到二千分目的、獲得本屆上海業餘擊彈甲組錦標、是亦朱氏歷年苦功動習之巨大收獲、而未來之黃金時代“逐漸現於目前、朱氏尤宜力求進境、以冀更大之成功、</p>
<p>朱氏初勝丁明毅、實有賴於鴻運之高照、彼其時朱氏已落後一百五十餘分、而在未後數槍中、朱氏竟捷足先達、複賽一幕、朱氏從容擊敗鳥承祥、獲得决賽權、最後奪標四塲、朱氏得力於第二塲一局、多勝二百二十餘分、第一第兩場、雙方並駕齊驅、相差有限、第四塲頗爲不利、幸勝分過多、目其本人於失勢之下、仍能振作精神、不失常態、錦標榮銜、乃歸其所有、本屆甲組錦標、當初原以美迪那呼聲最高張英達丁明毅次之、不料朱其良異軍突起、連勝丁張、取而代之、可謂異數矣、</p>
<p>張英達去歲亞軍、本屆又被其惡劣運命所制、竟坐失黃金機會、於最後一百分競爭之際、依然退居第二名當昨日第三場開始、雙方同在水平綫上、第四場則大起變化、張氏由落後二百三十五分之局面中、（一二九○比一五四五）發現六五·三四·四五·三四·三七等巨大分數反多勝四十分超出朱氏之前、（一七一六比一六七六）、不料張氏屢次大意、良机累失、朱氏又扶搖直上、一槍七十九分、再度居前、從此張氏仍臨逆境、跟隨朱氏之後、至一九○九比一九七一時、反身之機會又來、一槍已得五十二分、不料於緊要關頭失之交臂、朱氏乃達最後目的二千分、多勝張英達僅有三十九分、末塲比賽、歷時最久、九時一刻起至十二時三刻告終、</p>
<p>朱其良（前場）四二·二九·三五·二四·二一·一六·四○·二五·三八·二四·二九·（後場）二七·二四·七九·二○·二七·二四</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>盛傳洋麥續定</p>
<p>標準小麥跌一角左右</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份市面、呈初定續跌之象、以洋麥報　、美坎兩處微小、澳麥則漲二便士零、故開價時、市情尚穩、惟至收盤因粉市已跌且傳津青廠家、定成洋麥一船、人心遂更不振、較初開即跌二分至八分、迨至下午開盤、因交易所須停市九日、客户多頭、鑒洋麥之續定、吐售更猛、市氣逐歩低落三五分、據業中人之推測、以廿五年份麥收甚豐、産區存底、較往年爲多、而中國之新麥節令如逐漸接近、陳貨勢須陸續推銷、市氣之大轉變、恐在於此云、</p>
<p>多頭大批回出</p>
<p>期粉亦告不穩</p>
<p>昨日粉市、各月份市面、呈初穩繼則暴跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、回小一　角不等、利物浦則漲二便士零、故開價時、人心尚穩、與前日收盤、相差無幾、惟以　賬之故、昨爲最後一日之交易、業內外之買賣、均待了結、因此形勢已静中帶虚、過此之故、則市面逐歩瀉跌、傳天津及青島廠家、續定洋麥一船、計七八千噸、價九元一角、是以客户多頭大批回出、市勢　告不穩、迨至下午開盤、因洋麥續此消息市場均有傳播、業外多頭、似亦不能再擯、故跌勢更猛、近遠　計跌六七八分之巨、照此情形、結賬後之紅盤市面、如實銷一寂、須防瀉落云</p>
<p>河米到銷俱見寥落</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、蘇同帮無到、到船祇有薄稻及早稻十餘號、貨約三千四五百石、銷暢以大結束期近、店胃不過添備、包胃亦祇青島帮去薄稻千餘包、故市况無所變化、呈平定之局、厚薄粳行情悉無榮辱、各項花色均無行市、今日起南市米市將告結束、待紅盤再開、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各埠來船十　號、市上各貨去路、因各米　　備　　轉來賬　攻店　　納較前市更見淡弱、市價白粳高中之貨疲小數分至近角、下段定勢、早稻貨稀、價形挺立、薄稻疲軟、白元稍見鬆動、各秈及其餘各貨、價形疲弱之勢、收盤後各行有停斛之象、</p>
<p>客秈預備紅盤出樣</p>
<p>昨日客秈續有各埠裝到、但均預備紅盤出樣、行家亦已停止交易、客帮除裝運存貨外、亦無新交易問津、故昨日統市祗上午售開機糙米數百包、由厦門與本街分去、行情亦與前市相似內客秈市面、就此結束矣、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>倉庫存紗增高</p>
<p>本月紗獨跌一元强</p>
<p>紗市平静、趨勢和緩、良以昨市爲最後一日、多空大户缺乏競爭力、須待明春再决雌雄、但長豐代某君出檔七千三百包、同時三品紗市不帳、故檯面略見鬆懈、至於現紗客銷依然狹隘、人心愈疲、但二月期紗、金業帮、證劵帮、印商皆在多頭地位、將後之變遷、殊堪驚人也、倉庫中存紗漸漸增多矣、已達一萬六千餘包、</p>
<p>長豐大量吐出</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月參差不一、漲跌二·三角、蓋以本日爲最後一天營業、市塲交易殊形冷落、多空大户雙方不動、所有成交、均係零碎了結交易也、市價更乏興奮性、標紗結果五月比上日收盤價漲跌互見、上下一·二·三角、午後開盤市情軟化、因長豐益昶大量吐出、加之紗銷不旺、三品紗市歩歩下落、市價受其牽制、結果本月比上午收盤價跌九角、二月跌二角、其餘勿動、查賣出梅記一千六百包、益昶一千七百包、長豐七千五百包賡豐一千四百包、愼記一千二百五十包、恒昌八百包、大永六百包、福康一千一百包、昶記五百包、買進長餘一千四百五十包、大孚一千二百五十包、豐半六百包、森康五百五十包、元一一千八百包、大昶一千一百包、同和一千三百包、裕大一千五百包、大豐六百五十包、錦昌九百包、明德八百包、望泰興八百五十包、泰昌七百五十包、永大八百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現紗售價尚平</p>
<p>現紗銷路依然岑寂、查全日各帮買去統計三百九十包、售價與上日相仿、各帮買額列下、</p>
<p>紗廠假期停車</p>
<p>棉市絶無精彩</p>
<p>棉市平凡、氣勢亦無絶大榮辱可分、實以海外棉市不脱盤旋之象人心益覺軟弱、但各路來源凋敝、廠需因廢曆年暮、紗廠有幾天停車、採辦不健云、</p>
<p>標花小一角許</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉萎靡不振、印棉上升、但各路到頭殊感缺乏、浮户活動抵補、市盤轉昂、但塲內交易甚稀、標花結果各月比上日收盤價漲跌五分、午後開盤市况甚形平疲、上下五分、交易甚淸、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌五分至一角、查賣出同孚一千擔、裕康一千二百擔、振大一千六百擔、泰昌二千八百擔、益昶二千七百擔、同和五千一百擔、森康一千七百擔、協成一千擔、新昶一千二百擔、福源二千三百擔、買進吉豐一千三百擔、福康六千二百擔、永昌一千一百擔、源興昌一千擔、合興一千一百擔、望泰興一千八百擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現棉消費冷淡</p>
<p>現棉廠方需求不暢、來源姚花八百包、通花一百六十九包云、</p>
<p>押欵美棉昨有套出</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因利物浦消息良好、隔夜同業及若干外商買進、市况堅昂、各月漲二至七磅音、入後、押欵棉花初次套於塲中、人心爲之不寗、因之引起多頭了結、尤以華爾街之五月期爲最、幸同業逢跌買進、跌勢稍殺、卒以空户抵補、市價又堅、出口需要、可望進歩、刻因太平洋濱海員罷工、有若干棉花不能裝出、同時、德意兩國、亦有購買之可能、收盤堅穩、計現貨跌五磅音、期貨由不動至跌五磅音、英棉現貨漲八點、期貨漲四五點、印棉初因套賣及空户售出而跌、後因投機家買進及利物浦電訊順利而回、計平果爾漲○·七五至一羅比、奥姆辣漲○·七五至一羅比、白羅溪漲一至一·二五羅比、原電錄左、（四日電）</p>

<p>本客停辦檢點存貨</p>
<p>棉布交易已成尾聲</p>
<p>布市平平、交易漸見疏落、除遠路客帮及囤户偶有成交外、本街客帮泰半已停止裝辦各貨、檢點存貨、凖備度歳、大致祗賸明天一日交易、至二月十五日、再行開始營業、昨市面平定、東貨細布偶有回小（每疋）二分半之譜、本廠細斜數牌亦跌五分、春令、布高下檔均堅、綫嗶嗶嘰色布粗布售盤不動云、</p>
<p>呢絨銷路暫歸停頓</p>
<p>呢絨銷塲日來可謂完全停頓、同業祇忙於收賬、對於交易、反不甚注意、此乃歷年總結束前應有之現象也、坵貨帮所出之各樣本、現亦相率收歸、但往年此時業中及非業中人對押欵貨舊存貨或關店貨、往往、乘機收進、惟今年因老貨多已售罄、故此項交易遂寂然無聞云、</p>

<h3>踏上戰爭的路線</h3>
<p>— 胡對</p>
<p>敬告閨房裏的婦女</p>
<p>世界預言家所告訴給我們的一九三六年的危機，總算沒有爆發，可是迎頭而來的一九三七年，仍然還是不大樂觀的。作者固然不是世界的預言家，但是西歐東亞，到處擺着可燃的火燄：希特勒，墨索利尼，始終沒有變更他們的决心，西班牙的內戰只有延長和擴大的可能，此外以東方英吉利自命的東𨼺，如果還是行其所謂軍部的外交，那未·德日的協定或日意的通欵，這些事情，也必因彼此相互利害的所在面形成彼此相互的關係·所以拿幣個的世界來觀察，我們的前途，未許樂觀。就是退一步來説我們國家和民族所佔的空間和地位，也同樣的會使我們毛髮棟然！</p>
<p>自從東北四省被人佔據了以後，接下去還有冀眾綏三省事件的發生，再進又有華北五省獨立的謠傳，雖然幸虧良心未死的人們，不願做人家的傀儡，而人家總以為可欺的我們，用書心血，設法破壞我們的安全，所以我們現在的地位，處在十二萬分危險的當兒，民族國家所佔的空間，已經一些些的被人剝削，所以今後的我們，無論男婦老幼，都要負起救國自救的責任，尤其是青年的婦女，對於閨房的溫𣏗，現在是談非甚時了。</p>
<p>我們不必再談什麽理論，只要開耳目來聽聞，不是這裏一隊一隊的歸女去參加前線作戰或慰勞，便是那邊一隊一隊的婦女去參加演習救護成射擊。擦粉塗脂的時間，都改用在為慰勞戰士而縫衣製服的功夫上面去。美是自然的美，健是自然的健，不用人工的裝飾和做作，只要能够吃苦耐勞，擔任戰場上的任何工事，那才是健全的婦女。</p>
<p>軍號與戰鼓在我們前面催促着，“噠哆，噠哆，踏上戰線，踏上戰線”，這是時代逼着我們向前猛進的。踏上戰爭的路線，並不是時髦的要求，而是現中國現世界大家都應該動員的。我們也不是為着充滿了野心和慾望，我們只是爲着民族解放國家獨立而奮鬥。</p>
<h3>婦女是否將參加未來的戰爭？</h3>
<p>— 譯英國晚捷報特</p>
<p>這次西班牙內戰，婦女和男子并肩作戰，很覺勇敢，這是未來戰爭的一個前例麽？假使將來國與國交戰，是否要許或強迫婦女開人火綫，現在已成一個問題。有一位大學敎授，一位陸軍軍官，和幾位識見都值得尊重的人物，荘嚴地豫料，在下次戰爭中，婦女必出當兵，甚至英國女子，也不能免。所許當兵，並非如上次歐戰中，婦女只服務輔助軍團，而却要做和敵人直接交鋒的戰士。我聽了這種意見，倒有些毛骨悚然，但靜心一想，又估算一切的環璄，我不敢説這並非是不可能的事。第一件事可以决定的，英國如被一強國或數強國聯合攻擊，那末，必須以全國男女所有的力量抵抗，才能立於不敗之地。戰事發勸後，定將強徵全國在軍役年齡的男女，担任政府所以為合宜的軍役，這是不消説的。在最後緊急關頭，或將命身體結實的婦女，司管槍砲。將來戰爭，兩軍相距必遠，機關槍和來福槍能擊在視綫以外敵人的防地，大砲射程，能遠及數哩之遙，最新最利的武器，轟炸機，能在天空用致命的毒瓦斯彈轟炸集合的軍隊和海面的軍艦。這些新式武器，男女都能使用，不必倚賴強壯的體力。機關槍的輕便，尤合婦女的柔體，至於大砲，只要懂得算術，能計算射程和方向，婦女使用，能和男子同樣的精巧。再加英國的女飛行家，已表示和男子能同樣冒險耐勞，所以天空戰爭，在婦女並無難色。若説今日英國數百名已成功的女飛行家，在將來戰爭中，不能運用戰鬥飛機，那是决無此理。觀於上述各點，女子體力，不及男子，不能執戈捍衛疆土往日的辯論，在今日已成廢話·女子應否參戰？現在不過是一種道德問題，也可説是一種感情問題。但是依我個人的見解，任何文明政府，無論是最黷武的，對於這事，也從未夢想用強迫手段·這個問題的要點，乃在婦女是否願意參戰？假使她們願意，男子是否贊成，在我平生中，英國婦女的性質和地位，巳大變特變。她們和男子同享公民權，同有選舉權，她們能任各種職業，在許多工業中，還和男子競爭生活。男子呢，都很願意婦女和他們處於平等地位，承認她們做公民的根本權利。但是有一點，他們定要推却的，那便是他們定將堅决反對把婦女轉為殺人的人。假使英國一旦被強敵攻擊，男子它将和以前同样勇敢，站起身来，殺退敌人，它將高聲反抗訓練婦女使用鎗砲炸彈。在我們英國，是很尊愛婦女的，假使把她們陷入流血殘酷的勾當，那却是一件不可言喻的墮落。</p>
<h3>寒假中應注意的事</h3>
<p>— 膽星</p>
<p>眼前正值寒假，女同學們早已離開學校，遄返故里，但怎樣消磨這一個多月的假期呢？有些女同學以為：暑假是避暑”的，寒假是“避寒”的，理應暫把一切功課拋棄半邊，整天價吩附傭僕，扇旺了火爐，圍爐取煖，吃吃躺躺，實足亨上一假期的福，或者看着梅花，或者溜溜冰，等而下之，和家人們打打牌。消遣和娛樂，亦屬一種精神和體格的休養，在假期中在所難免，我並不怎樣反對，祇是把整個假期的光陰，完全消耗在“玩”“吃”和“睡覺”中，我却認為是莫大的“奢侈”。何不利用這假期的空間而做一點工作呢！</p>
<p>有些女同學們或者要説：我們正在求學，有什麽工作可做？家庭雜務有傭僕，經濟分配有父母。誠然，優裕的生活環境會養成不知工作爲何物的小組身份。但是，眼前的優裕環境能否永久維護你們享福，你們又能否永久躲在學校裏，而不跑到社會上來？可以確定的代你們回答，萬萬不可能眼前和將來的社會，次不會給人以安逸享福的權利，男子要靠工作換取生活，女子何嘗能例外。或許，今日之下，仍不乏抱錯誤觀念的女子，以為只要能嫁得一個有資產，有本領的夫婿，便可一生吃養無優。這在未受敎育沒有智識的女子，猶可原諒，若在智識女子而仍作如是想，那就良深痛惜。</p>
<p>那許多在迷茫中的徘徊者，正待先知先覺的智識分子去指破迷律，從水深火熱中挽救出來，自己豈容再蹈覆轍！惟有自食其力的人，才能獲得眞正的解放，亦惟有自食其力的人，才能建樹起獨立的人格。因此，不能不及早養成生活的本能力，在學校裏得到的，祇是有限的書本敎育，目前的事實告訴我們；光是擁有書本智識，生活還是危險，大學生的“挺而走險”，書局編輯和產科醫生的夫婦還得被迫於生活而自殺，就是“鐵證”，最近政府注重生產敎育，多失職業學校，正因於此。我們在求學時代，當有所警惕。</p>
<p>甚盼女同學們在寒假期內，別專貧享園爐的福，家庭的服務，鄉里的服務，都不妨去實踐一下，一人的能力不夠，可多集合點同學或同鄉………去幹。布機上也好，田園裏也好，工作是沒有尊卑和範圍的，雖祗短短的一個多月寒假，都正是鍛鍊你們耐勞苦，打定自立謀生基礎的絕好機會。</p>
<h3>怎樣煮食物</h3>
<p>— 潔芬</p>
<p>—一個聰明主婦該有的普通常識—</p>
<p>做一個主婦日常最困難的工作，便是怎樣弄幾樣好的食物。這裏告訴你幾種普通食物的煮法，也是一個聰明的主婦該有的普通常識煮猪肉：</p>
<p>煮猪肉最不易爛，可入山楂少許，卽可速爛，而其味亦仍存：又法：置蘇打亦可，惟不及山楂之佳。</p>
<p>煮火肉：煮火腿，皮極不易爛，若於未入水前，塗以白糖殆滿，則頃刻卽爛，而味又腴美。</p>
<p>煮鹹肉：鹹肉倘有臭味，當煮之時，用胡桃十餘枚，殼上鑽多孔同煮之，則臭味自减。</p>
<p>煮白肚：猪肚燒熟後，切成長塊，盛碗中，然後加湯少许，置飯锅上蒸之，卽能加厚一倍，但不可用鹽，否則卽堅硬而縮。</p>
<p>煮羊肉：用囫圇蘿蔔一個，全身鑽細孔，與羊肉同時下湯，煮四十分鐘，再將蘿蔔取去，然後紅燒白燒，可無腥羶之味。</p>
<p>煮老鴨：下鍋時，放螺螄數粒同煮之，卽易爛熟。</p>
<p>煮海參：欲求速發開者，可以破磁器碰成小片投入，則發開甚速。</p>
<p>煮蔬菜：凡煮食蔬菜，地上莖者，宜用沸水：地下莖者，宜用冷水。但山芋一物，不在此例。</p>
<p>煮海帶：海帶一物，其質堅靱，雖經久煮之，亦難使軟，費時需柴，在在可惜。若於煮時，加醋少許，則易於𣏗軟而可口矣。</p>
<p>煮墨棗；可以燈草同煮之，則皮自能脫去。</p>
<p>煮鮮魚：俟鍋燒然後，勿先下油，以生姜一塊，擦鍋殆遍，然後人汕煮魚，則無論如何，魚皮不致與鍋底相粘而使魚肉粉碎。</p>
<p>煮洋薯：洋薯下鍋後，其色如將變黑，可加醋數滴於所煮之水中，則其色自白，而且鬆軟適口。</p>
<p>煮蛋：煮蛋時，先以冷水濕之，然後投入沸水，則不致碎裂。</p>
<p>煮筍。新筍以沸湯煮之，則易熟面脆尤美。或加入薄荷少許，再撒鹽數粒，則不歛。</p>
<h3>婦女敎育館訪談記</h3>
<p>— 張彰</p>
<p>敎育的機會本來是應該平等的，不論男子婦女，只要他和她，都是圓趾方顱的人類，那末，誰都有享受敎育的機會，認都應該讀書識字的、可是，理論上的説法，雖然如此，在事實上，只爲了咱們中國數千年來重男輕女的封建思想，在一般人的腦海中，牢牢的主宰着，一般的認為：男子是應該讀書識字的，享受敎育的，而女子呢？在“女子無才便是德”的口號之下。便生生的把她們享受敎育的機會剝削了，這是多麽殘酷而不合理的事呀！</p>
<p>近數十年來，婦女也應該享受敎育的呼聲，是漸漸的給理社會注意了，於是，除了女學勃興而外，專門辦理婦女敎育事業的機關團體，也繼續成立起來，（上海婦女敎育館，便是辦理婦女敎育事業的團體之一，在這裏，作者把該館的近况，以及工作的範圍，向讀者諸君報告一下。</p>
<p>是一個嚴冬的清晨，爲了要如道一些婦女敎會館的實况起見，便雇了一輛街車，直往華龍路那裏拉去，到達了館門，向傳達員説明了來意，一位王青的服務員，便開姑嚮導我到會客室裏去。</p>
<p>我們的談話，倒在這時候開始了。據這位服務員説：一婦女敎育的成立，到現在已有整整的四五個年頭了，館長是周報韶先生，周先生所以要創辦婦女敎育館的目的，是為了看到一般家庭婦女們，有很多沒有受到相當的敎育，以致在處理家政方面，墨守成法，沒有什麽以善的計劃，這和社會的秩序，民族的前途，都是有着相當的密切的關系的，爲了使一般的家庭婦女們，都能夠普遍的得到一些治家的常識，處理家務的技能，以及育兒衛生方面等等的智識，便决心來辦這個上海婦女敎育館，作為實施婦女敎育的出發地。成立以後，因為社會人士的熱烈贊助，所以館務的發展，是相當的迅速。館中每週舉行館務會議一次，商討館務進行方針，並辦有婦女補習學校，招收年長失學的家庭婦女，來館補習，收取極低廉的學費，希望一般附近的年長失學婦女，都有來館受補習敎育的機會。組織主婦會，每月開會一次，討論家庭問題，并請女界先進，到會演講。主辦母親會，也是每月開會一次，討論育兒方法，訓導見童問題，此外并主辦婦女藝訓練班，敎授工藝技能，如編織傳留班，方於去年十二月結束，很能引起一般婦女的興趣。除此之外，我們還出版婦女月報，每月發行冊，刊載開於婦女問題的文字，和𢑥刊婦女界的消息，定戶完全以婦女為對象。”</p>
<p>至於該館的經費，擬這位服務員説：“完全由周館長擔負，不足之數，則向外界捐寡，目前在收支方面，可以不發生問題。不過為了要多辦些關於婦女敎育方面的事業，很希望政府方面，加以相當的津貼，來扶助婦女敎育的發展，這是很希望於最短期間實現的一件事”。</p>
<p>時針指着十一點鐘的光景，為了不願多費服務員的寶貴時間，便和他握手道別。在歸途上，我默默的祝賀該館的前途，有著長足的發展,替中國的婦女敎育事業，創造一個偉大的新生命。</p>
<h3>閒話童養媳</h3>
<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>童養媳是從前舊禮敎下，舊式婚姻制度下所產生的，媒妁之言，父母之命的盲目婚姻之一種。然而它的遺毒，一直到現在還沒有完全消滅：關於童養媳的悲劇，也不斷地在那窮鄉僻邑的古老家庭中扮演着。要是我們願意跑到這些地方去調查一下的話，我相信一定會發現不少所謂童養媳，更其是那些童養媳出身的過來人。</p>
<p>事實上，童養媳的生活和婢女沒有什麽分別，不過名義上與身分上有所不同而已。然而我們只聽到廢娼廢婢運動的呼聲，但却沒有廢除童養媳制度的吶喊！其實，我們要謀婦女解放，要澈底改革婚姻制度，那首先還得要消滅那有普遍性而殺害男女幸福的童養媳。</p>
<p>雖然目前一般鄉民智識已較前開化了點，而對於兒女的婚姻也似乎不像過去那們的固執了，但是依然絕對地不同意放任主義，命運論和媒妁之言却仍舊在不衰地盛行着。尤其是童養媳制度，比了過去愈加普遍了。這雖則在當事者爲了避諱“養媳婦”的稱謂而改叫一通脚媳婦，可是其實呢，還不是一一而一一而二，換湯不換藥，徒不過巧立了一個名目罷了。</p>
<p>説到童養媳的起源，我雖不知道始於何代，但其原因總不外乎指腹爲婚，或因為兩家莫逆，也有的是為了省錢和貧苦：其理由，在從前都是認爲非常正當或不得已的。</p>
<p>至於一個女孩子，不論在襁褓中或十多歲，一經做了人家的童養媳，一切的命運和生活便得由那未來的翁姑去支配，自己的自由從此就開始被人剝奪了。要待到伊和未婚妻正式宣告完姻之後，伊的日子𦆵能够出一半頭。如果伊的未婚夫是一個不良行爲的人，説不定要受他的威脅而被蹂躪，所以一吃冷飯“勒壁角”的事，在有童養媳的家庭裏是常有發生的·倘然不幸而伊自己死了呢，自然沒有什麽可説，要是未婚夫死了，那多份是墓守望門寡的·直到生滿了三年孝堂，守滿了孝之後，準備立志守罰而博一個貞婦烈女美名（？）的不必説，此外，要想走路—出嫁—話，那除了要徵求翁姑同意之外，還要交相當的身價給翁姑。反之，翁姑們却可隨便地把伊嫁給人家，或招一個“黃泥膀女壻”到家裏去，代替他們兒子的職務；伊當然仍舊要如以媳媳奉侍翁姑的禮節去孝敬他們。</p>
<p>還有兩種，在鄉村裏認為正大光明而且非常通行的，㊀就是冲喜；——當未婚夫病在床第而將藥石絕望的時候，家人們便用了迷信的習慣，把童養媳去和一個　無生望的病人拜堂結親，送入洞房，終至爲了勞動過度而速其死，使那個無辜的女孩子，也亳無理由的去做了未亡人，”小則斷送了伊的寶貴青春，大則犧牲了伊一生幸福：像這種有綹無益的迷信風俗，眞是應該從速打倒。㊁凡一個童養媳一旦自己的未婚夫過世後，如果伊的命運並不壞，那末就把伊配給了未婚夫的弟弟，這調之一叔接嫂。”</p>
<p>據我所耳濡目染的，關於童養媳的悲慘故事也指不勝屈，而且凡是童養媳的遭際大都是很惡劣的，所以，我深深地覺得童養媳實在是婦女運動中的一個嚴重問題！</p>
<h3>第四信</h3>
<p>— （卓呆）</p>
<p>B女士：</p>
<p>我正想和人家談一個我國家庭中最重要的問題。現在女士旣和我討論庭園興我們人生，究竟有多大使命？那天，我可以趁此機會，與女士談談了。婦女是家庭中的主人，所以這問題，更應當和婦女們談·</p>
<p>家庭家庭，誰都這麽呌着，誰都這麽説着。試問：我們居然稱着家庭，自已可曾檢點过？有些覺得慚愧否？我們中國人，雖然有家，庭在那裏？家裏有庭的，能有幾個人？有家無庭，可以稱得家庭麽？這是我們中國人一個很嚴重的問題。上海式的房子，烟囱似的一個蟹眼天井，這可以稱庭麽？家裏有一片空地，在空地上，洗衣淘米倒垃圾，這可以稱庭麽？實實在在我們中國人的家庭，不過有家能了，並沒有庭。</p>
<p>庭是什麽？怎樣才可以叫做庭？庭就是我跟你討論的庭園。不一定要造成一個幾十畝大小的所謂花園，才可以稱爲庭園．只消與房屋相稱，有這麽一片空地，把它從觀賞上着想，從實用上着想，也不一定要多大的經費，佈置成一個幽雅的庭園，這是我們生活上很需要的。</p>
<p>我們沒有家庭則已，旣有家庭這名稱，就不能使牠成一個殘缺不全的家庭，一定要在家之外，再附屬一個庭，這並不是奢華生活，在我們身體上，精神上，都很需要。男子們，在外面勞勤了一天，晚上回去，不能再叫他吃官司似的關在房子裏了，在庭中，花前月下，和妻了們玩玩，這才是家庭之樂。星期日休息，也不必坐了火車出去旅行，儘可以在家裏休息了。有朋友來時，也人可以在庭中消遣消遣。</p>
<p>婦女們，對於庭園，比男子們更要緊，男子們出外的時候多，婦女們一天到晚在家，如果不用庭園來調劑精神身體，兀首悶坐在家中，一些沒有變化，實在是苦痛的事。至於孩子們，跑跑跳跳，那更少不得這麽個庭園。家庭二字，本來是相聯的，平行的，近來不知怎樣的成為畸形的，所以我們必須要恢復它。</p>
<p>造花國，無論什麽人的頭腦中，都以為是一件極費錢的事，其實並不如此．房子小的，塵園的面積，當然也小，所費就有限了。而且庭園的材料，無非是樹與石，這些東西，價錢貴的當然有，價錢便宜的也不少，并且價昂的材料，未必一定能成好的庭園。庭園的好不好！全在佈置的人的藝術如何。這好比繪畫，同樣的用這幾樣顏料，有的可以成爲名畫，有的只好做窗心，所以如果眞有造園的藝術，那末説不定花二三百元造的庭園，可以打倒花一二萬元造的庭園咧。女士！我希望你們出來恢復家庭兩個字，不要有名無實。</p>
<h3>希望於女作家們</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>最近海上文壇有幾位作家，曾借靑年會開過一個“文藝界座談會”，著名的作家們，差不多到齊了，可是在這樣一個盛會裏，竟找不出一個女作家來，這不能不説是一件奇事。因爲這次座談會，不僅僅是召集他們的同道友好吃茶談天，而是另外更有偉大的目的，是想把整個的中國文藝界，聯合在一條陣綫上，來做統一救國的文化運動的。所以這座談會，遠非普通的應酬可比，那麽救國是人人的責任，女作家們絕非例外的了。你既然會寫文章，能辦刊物，也就可以算得是文藝界的一員了。一個文藝界所聯合的陣容，爲什么要剩下一部份的同道呢！所以我懷疑着中國的女作家們恐怕都沒有在上海，不然就是中國的歸女中，會寫文章，能辦書報的，却沒一個有資格進得文藝之林！不過無論如何，在那文藝界統一字眼之下，總難免使人覺得遺憾的！</p>
<p>因此，使我更感到這幾年來·女文藝作者實在是太沉寂了！除了七八年前曾經盛極一時的幾位先輩之外，後起之秀也無多．雖然在上海辦有幾種女子刊物，可是可以拿得出來，風行各地的大眾讀物却不大有得，就是像冰心女士過去听寫的寄小讀者，那一種作品都很少，無怪，文藝界中要把女作家忘記了！</p>
<p>我旣不懂文藝更不敢妄發議論，現在是以一個青年學生的資格，來希望有條養的女作家們，退一步説是能寫文章的女同胞們，大發努力文藝運動，多產生點救國救民的文藝作品，假使，女作家們也能來一次女文藝界座談會，組織一個什麽協會，來大家共同努力，共同研究，產生大批的救國文學，那當然更是我所馨香禱祝的</p>
<h3>來函</h3>
<p>編輯先生：頃閲貴刋第四十八期，內有東京通訊，題爲「轟動留東學生的軒然大波」，奉讀之下，非常駭異。該文表面爲「婦女解放問題」，實際爲發洩私憤，兹特依據事實，記其大要如下：</p>
<p>（一）晋並未發瘋　該文所謂「據接近魏晋的友人説，他假裝神經病，想藉此缷責」等語，完全虚構。晋雖於民二十三年爲妻曾奕女士有姙，送入東京順天堂醫院保胎時，爲了安慰兒母，生活失調，以至兩年來患着腸胃病及鼻病和失眠，但並未發瘋。</p>
<p>（二）晋未發傳單　斐女士雖想以晋發瘋之理由，將無憑據之責任加在晋身上，但這不過和她在留日學生監督處控告晋殺曾奕，壓廹女性一樣無聊，因爲她控告晋殺人之唯一證據爲她自己的「夢」也。至於可以證明晋未發傳單之理由甚多，其最著者有（一）晋未發瘋。（二）晋不幹此種無聊事。（三）所謂傳單也者，晋至今尚未看見。（四）東京警視廳曾派人教晋可以依法控告她們，但晋都在感謝之下而謝絶了。（五）晋與斐女士既無經濟關係，當無所謂「騙錢」等千；且並非深交，更不詳知斐女士之爲人等。</p>
<p>（三）晋和曾奕女士的關係，晋和曾奕女士，不獨已有五六年的夫婦事實，且已生子女三人，雖然戀愛結合，可曾獲得雙方家長同意。簡略的請過客人，且受過親友的禮物。雙方家長的禮金等，雖然民二十四年十二月二十三日斐女士帶她在監督處提出離婚要求，晋以其用「夢」做證據誣告晋殺人之理由不能成立，至今没有同意。總之，晋與曾奕女士不獨尚未離婚，且爲多年夫妻感情，家庭幸福，子女負担，雖至今日，晋尤不能不愛兒母曾奕也。</p>
<p>以上，完全根據事實所寫，毫無虚語。希望編輯先生維持公正態度，披露報端，則不獨已有子女之家庭能得保障，且亦可防止青年男女錯走「玩弄人生」之歧路也。草草，敝請撰安，並希指教！　魏晋一月二十五日</p>
<h3>婚後</h3>
<p>— （浣月）</p>
<p>為了要減輕一點他的負擔，終於在我們結婚後的第二個月就重又走進這社會裏來了！</p>
<p>還算僥倖吧，才過了兩個月的試辦期，薪水已從四十元增加至六十元了！</p>
<p>眞的，這年頭，不景氣滿佈了灰色的上海城，一般小商號都倒閉的倒閉了，清理的清理了，偶然存在着的大公司，裁員减薪還來不及呢，那裹談得上加不加，的確，我覺得很滿足了，這樣！</p>
<p>僅僅是個小職員——報關行裏的打字員——能夠每天不費事的。到兩塊錢，確是不很容易了吧！我常常這樣的安慰着自已！</p>
<p>的確，我以爲再沒有話會比一知足常樂一説得更對了，我這樣想，他辦公的地方，跟我距離得太遠了，除非有特別的事故。我們白天終不會見面的，因爲我們的午餐，都包給附近的飯舖子裏！</p>
<p>我們都是有些孩子氣的，喜歡結伴兒走，每天傍晚，我打從江西路踅進南京路，他從靜安寺路轉過來，無論是誰早誰晚，或者是下雨下雪，我們都等候在先施公司電車站！</p>
<p>有時候，吃了晚飯，我們還到附近的二等戲院去看看國產影片，説不定還去聽聽書。這樣便消麽了一天！</p>
<p>他最喜歡抱小孩子，我們有時候終是為了這事鬥着氣，他整整衣帽向外邊溜了，我不肯屈、服，也走進廂房裏去打打牌，他歸來後，我們又嘻嘻哈哈地笑了！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>廢除長袍馬褂</h3>
<p>— 天羽</p>
<p>説到長袍馬褂，這曾是最近七八年來我國最堂皇的法定的“禮服”。不久以前，宋哲元將軍有一次招待賓客，在請帖上還特爲註明：赴會者須一律穿服“藍袍黑褂”云。此外，國府有重大典禮，主席接受外國公使之勤見時，躋躋蹌蹌者，皆藍袍黑褂也。上海市舉行集團結婚，規定的新郎禮服，也是藍袍黑褂的。而現在新加坡僑商陳嘉庚氏，乃電呈國府，請將長袍馬褂之禮服予以廢除。謂“長衣馬褂，乃清服遺制，時宜卽失，早應廢除，今仍遵照禮服，實尼影響民族心理，阻碍民族復興”云云。在同一電文之後，有如下按語：“查民國十八年頒布之服制條例，現擬修正，由內政部擬有草案，正審查中”。則前此被規定八禮服之長袍馬褂，或竟廢除，亦未可知。</p>
<p>對於衣服之微，似乎是無關於國計民生的。但自從我國古人喊出了一句：“服之不衷，身之災也”的話，從此衣服一項也大有講究乏道了。民國以前，歷代服制，皆有等級之別，不必説官員與平民之間，有鴻溝之別，卽青一袷之秀才們，所謂儒生者，其所穿儒巾服，也非市井小人隨便可着的。看儒林外史可以知道。民国以後，此等區別，當然已不存在，只是衣服之有關某種大道理，還有人隱隱承認。長袍馬褂，就含有保持東方精神文明之道理。民國初元所制定之服制爲西洋燕尾大禮服，顯然探自外國之形式，長袍馬褂爲中國所固有，要説保持東方固有美德，此爲最宜。只是據陳嘉庚氏此次電文所説，此項服式，却又是満清所遺，就民族上説，這又是外來服式之一種。只因沿用已久，外來之物也成固有之物了。記得魯迅先生有一篇説“鬚”的雜文，據説現在日本流行之兩角上翹之鬚，倒原是漢族原有之鬚式流傳過去的，而現在中國人所留兩角平下之鬚，則正是北方夷族之鬚式，但沿流之久，有人却反認日本之鬚式爲日本的，我們學不得，而一字平鬚，則爲中國所固有，被人認爲祖宗所遺呢！這與長袍馬褂之原爲清代服制而人不覺，眞是同一情形。不經陳氏指出，我們也眞忘了。</p>
<p>近年在種種方面，中國固有精神，發揮甚力。舉如建築一項亦然，畫棟彫樑，一時稱盛。只是在內容上又全採外來方法的，這也是一種矛盾。一定要以一切固有的東西，保留於今日，精神固可以使人佩服，但總有吃力不討好之感。與其如此，不如由着歷史走爲好罷。因談衣服，遂聯想及之。</p>
<h3>燈塔老人</h3>
<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>從小的時候，我的過分富於同情的心便被許多瑣屑的事感動得顫動起來了。</p>
<p>十四歲的時候，父親爲了商業上的失敗，不能不從萬隆——那個生長我的地方，搬家到芝拉扎州的芝布吉史——一個僻靜的海邊的小鄉鎮。</p>
<p>在那兒：沒有學堂。有的祇是長長地迤邐着在太陽光下面閃爍着的白色的沙滩，蔚蓝的不停地用着白色浪潮衝擊着海岸的遼阔的大海，蟹螫一樣環抱着遠遠地伸展到海上的兩道石堤——從海邊還望得見兩道石堤的終點各有一個矮塔一樣終夜裏放射着光芒的燈塔。此外，還有什麽呢？一個澄藍可愛的天空吧。那是照顧着漁人們在晨光曦微中出海而去，又照顧着他們在黃昏的殘輝裏搖着欵乃小舟回來的。</p>
<p>我感覺得孤獨起來了。</p>
<p>每天每天逡巡在海邊拾些貝壳，扒開沙穴捕捉小蟹，或者就到樹林裏找個蔭蔽的多草的地方躺起來吧——然而，什麽時候你總要嘆息起來的。人，有什麽法子逃得開羣聚的生活呢？</p>
<p>有一天，那在大海的懷抱裏長長地伸展開去的發光的石堤突然引起了我無限的好奇了。我試着沿着石堤走過去——到了左面那個燈塔的門前。……看塔的馬來老人驚奇地同我發生了友誼。……以後，每天早上我便要走過被大海包圍着的石堤和老人一起混過一天的時光了；到了海面輕輕地掀起了風，海鷗和老鷹們開始在海浪上面低低地盤旋起來的時侯，老人便把我送出塔門來。</p>
<p>老人是孤獨的。海風吹得使他佝僂了，浪濤使他聽不到比浪濤低小的聲音。然而兩雙眼睛却是銳利的，同海一樣望得遠，同鷹一樣看得清楚。</p>
<p>老人喜歡説故事，大半生的時光，他一壁諦聽着浪涛的聲音，一壁便想出了許多故事。</p>
<p>“……啊，那是很和愛很和愛的老人呢！在人世問，你是找不出的，因爲魔鬼使人們都變壞了——但是，從海邊，他是會鑽出來的。……”</p>
<p>老人喜歡這樣開頭。常常是把頭幾乎貼到我臉上來，就這樣聽他的説話，又講他的故事的。</p>
<p>“但是，他不會浸死的嗎？”</p>
<p>“不會的，”老人笑起來了，一雙眼睛深深地被皺紋埋蓋起來。“那裏會浸死的呢？那些一起一伏的翻騰的白浪就是老人的呼吸。……！等到惡人太多了的時候，老人就要鑽出來，把惡人捉進大袋子裏，帶到海底深處。……”</p>
<p>老人使得我幻想起來了。那些老人的故事在我的想像裏織成了一幅美麗可愛的畫面。在孤獨的時候，我便融進了我的幻景裏，彷彿看見了那和靄公正的老人，海裏的神仙，以及美麗幽靜的世界。</p>
<p>……以後，父親又要把家搬到首都吧達威亞去了。老人把耳朵貼着我的嘴，聽出了這消息的時候，搖搖頭，輕輕</p>
<h3>掙脫死神的利爪</h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>我們在圖畫上，可以看見畫出來的死神，穿着黑色的衣裳，戴着黑色的帽子，眼睛祇是兩個黑洞，滿口的利牙，伸着一雙利爪的手，致人於死！——人死的原因是不同的，但大部分却是因病而死；所以也可説是死神拿“病”做殺人的唯一工具。不过人病的時候如果有適當的治療，即使患病很重，也能掙脫死神的利爪。</p>
<p>適當的治療不外良醫和良藥，五洲大藥房有醫於此，特製家用良藥三百餘種，種種靈驗，並在四馬路大廈內設各科名醫診室，主診的都是上海最有名的醫士。這樣，病勢輕微的祇須照服成藥，病勢較重的可以求醫診治，就無往不化凶爲吉了。</p>
<h3>年夜飯</h3>
<p>— 新運</p>
<p>在一間客廳裏，擺着一桌酒筵，桌子上菜肴雜陳，老幼圍坐在桌子旁邊，笑語風生：爐內燃着熊熊的火，忘却寒意；這是李宅吃年夜飯的情景。</p>
<p>李太太巳經是近五十歲的人了，她今天的興致特別好，她吃了許多菜，還吃了兩碗飯。一邊牠還經管着孩童，並且殷勤勸着別人，她的精神一點也不困倦。</p>
<p>記得去年的時候，李太太患着貧血病，面色蒼白，手足常冷，吃東西一點也不覺得有滋味！並且精神疲憊！自從她調服“自來血”以後，她的臉色漸漸紅潤，食量漸漸增加，諸症都霍然了，所以她才有今天吃年夜飯的快樂呢。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>地説，一面從窗裏望着大海：</p>
<p>“我又是孤獨的人了！”</p>
<p>從芝布吉史搬到吧達成亞，其後六年——一直到現在，從爪哇到蘇門答臘，到婆羅州，甚至於回到了祖國的珠江　或，長江流域，緒程——是越走越遠了，然而，每當看到海的時候，或是夜裏括起大風的時候，我便常常想起芝布吉史的燈塔老人，想到他孤獨獨地在浪濤的包圍中的凄凉的日子。</p>
<p>“祝福他吧！孤獨的老人！”</p>
<p>我常常默禱。</p>
<h3>故鄕的新年</h3>
<p>— 石</p>
<p>在故鄉的新年裹，最會引起小孩子們的興趣的玩意，就要算“舞獅”這一套了。</p>
<p>舞獅班，每一班多的約有三四十個人，少的也有二十多個人；各人都着了同樣的衣服，腰裏繫着帶子，個個都是雄糾糾的。元旦的開門砲一響，他們就開始到人家來舞獅，最盛的時期，要算元旦到初五六這幾天了，一過了初五六也就慢慢地少見了。舞獅班有下面的四種：</p>
<p>麒麟，這多是由市上的居民組合的，鄰市的鄉村也有。舞獅中這種比較最出色，因爲牠底人數多，用具也整齊；鑼鼓是用一副大銅鈸，一個響鼓，一面厚銅的鑼，奏起來非常響亮雄壯。用竹紮紙糊做成一個麒麟頭，給上美麗的顏色，拿絨線做牠底鬚和毛，拿一丈長，四尺闊，畫上彩色的布匹做身子；布的末端，再用一束絨線做成尾巴。舞的時侯，一個人雙手拿着麒麟頭，一個人俯首傴背的冒在尾端，鑼鼓一響，兩個人就在塲子裏舞出種種的姿勢。舞完了，就演拳棍，接着又一對一對的比那雙刀，槍牌等武器。</p>
<p>獅，多來自附近的鄕村，舞演的狀况，也和前者相似，不過鑼鼓却不同。獅頭是扁圓形的，直徑大約兩尺多。一個鼓，兩面鑼，都比前者小，聲音也都不及前者的洪亮，刀，槍，牌，也比較小，不過有的加演數人的比棒和跳桌。</p>
<p>客仔獅，也多是附近鄉村中玩弄的，大概和“獅”很相似，不過獅頭不是扁圓的：牠有一尺多大，很像貓的頭，下顎是活動可以開合的。門外還有四個人，戴着假面具，兩個是猴形，兩個作笨伯，跟着獅舞弄，裝出種種諧詼的動作。</p>
<p>外江獅，都是外鄉來的，人數比較少，獅頭，鑼鼓，都和客仔獅相同，不過沒有假面具；技術都比較精巧，常常發了幾張桌子，人在桌頂演出各種戲法。</p>
<p>除上述的四種舞獅外，成人們比較歡迎的要算“燈酒”，“花燈”這兩個了。</p>
<p>燈酒，元宵節，家家要備牲禮去祀神祭祖，大街小巷中的人家，凡在去年養了男孩子的，他們就在這天設筵致宴，要是族中有公產的人家，那就由公衆來辦酒席，在宗祠裏宴飲。這就呌做“燈酒”。這天晚上，晶亮的月色和輝煌的燈光映着，加倍的響亮，又雜着孩子們的呼笑聲，男男女女一羣羣的街上遊逛，看花燈，鞦韆，小孩們提着紙燈，亂跑亂斟，要樂得發狂，這樣要直鬧到更深才歇。</p>
<p>花燈，燈是用禾草，彩紙紮成人物樓閣，環列在用竹片，彩紙製成的塔形的架子的旁邊，或排列在長約八九尺的木架的旁邊，這就呌做“花燈”。這種花燈，多掛在較大的神廟中央，供人們玩賞。元宵以後，各人用紅紙一條，簽了一××敬求花燈一架”字樣，貼在花燈的下邊，到十七那天，由神廟的廟祝，將各人貼的紙簽，在神前逐條的擲杯珓，聖珓（一陰一陽）最多的，就把這架花燈送給他。送的時候，一路上打着鑼鼓，吹着細樂，放着聯砲，也是很熱鬧的·</p>

<p>元昌（一一二○）上午十一時三刻至半時</p>
<p>開篇「幼時情」（咪咪集創刋號）</p>
<p>悽雨愁風夜三更，翻覆牀衾不安寗。如悲泣，子規聲，頓然提起幼時情。想常初，相愛相護如姐弟，一天難以兩離當。年各幼稚不知情，嬉戲同庭是天真。到後來，長大漸識春風意，方知情深談愛情。彷彿連理枝，宛似兩同心，前世有緣訂三生。那知月老簿上無緣份三生石上又無名。萬不料，舅母挈卿到東瀛去，乃是上蒼數就結寃情。雙雙淚别來分首，倐忽光陰已數春。諒卿是，伉儷之間心歡樂，我還是，玉潔冰淸一童身。忘了三餐茶與飯，猶無伴侣度良辰。爲了你，骨瘦如柴容憔悴，神志恍惚亂夢渾。爲了你，不配姻親逆母意，我惟一心愛上卿，可恨終是杳無影。鵲橋尚有牛女會，今生可能再相親，日夜思來欲斷魂。</p>
<p>曹笑英「玉蜻蜓」</p>
<p>中西（一○四○）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「掃秦」</p>
<p>休笑掩瘋痴垢面形，地藏王有意落凡塵。借身打坐靈隱寺，壁上題詩爲掃秦。拈春來了當朝相，三炷淸香手內擎，低頭默默暗通神。但願風調和雨順，惟求夫婦得長春。保佑岳家賢父子，往昇仙界早超生。抬頭猛見留詩句，奸雄戰懍頓然驚。此詩乃與夫人作，事發春窗烈火焚，立時怒問喚瘋僧。那曉他，口吐禪機多變化，呼風喚雨盡皆能。手執火筒通外國，還會棕帶掃奸臣。風波只爲專權起，含寃屈死冷泉亭。歸家夫婦同商議，削髮皈依却利名。聽信了讒言長舌婦，受盡了酆都地獄刑，到如今，渾身鐵鑄岳王墳。</p>

<h3>廢歷新年大上海映「樂園思凡」</h3>
<p>㶷爛無匹的偉大彩片艷情巨片「樂園思凡」，將於舊曆新年的時候，在大上海大戲院公映。彩色片一向在好萊塢是一種嘗試，可是「樂園思凡」一片，已臻圓熟到極點美妙到萬分的地歩。導演利用着彩色片的過人的特長，處處用了動人的鏡頭，將最複雜，最美妙，最高度興奮的情緒與畫面，詩意地流露出來。片中主角係神秘性女星瑪琳黛德麗。瑪琳以前主演的片子，早已膾炙人口。本片中表演一個　　的懷春的少女，益見得爐火純青，合演者有却爾鮑育，却爾自從「琴挑」一片露頭角後，本片實爲該氏登峯造極之傑作云。</p>

<p>一個年輕的畫家，有着藝術的修養與愛好的青年，帶着一顆活躍燃燒的心，跳進了影園，他的認真，他的努力，未來的光榮收穫，這是可以保證的。</p>
<p>謝俊，他加入明星公司的演員陣容，還是不久以前的事，但是對於觀衆，他的名字已經相當熟悉了。在「夜會」裏，他扮一個紈袴少爺，對於那一種人的個性言行，表演得淋漓盡緻，他驚人的天才，從此給予人們一個相當的認識，在「生死同心」「淸明時節」以及最近的「永遠的微笑」裏，他都演着很重要的角色，這新人的前途，是光明燦爛的。</p>
<p>現在，他在張石川導演的新片「壓歳錢」裏，飾演的是一個窘小孩小三子的父親，穿着破舊骯髒的衣服，同舒繡文是一對夫妻，住在狹小的草棚裏。他的孩子每天都到各處去拾垃圾，某一天，偶然在垃圾桶裏發現了一塊錢，歡喜得連忙趕回家給謝俊夫婦觀看。</p>
<p>「一塊大洋鈿」在某些人是不足爲奇的，但是在窘得衣食不週的人看來，却是如獲至寶，他們夫婦倆爭着看，四圍的鄰居也全體都趕來欣賞這「一塊大洋鈿」，人多手多，你搶我奪，忽然某一間草棚裏火燒起來了，大家忙於救火，一時哭喊之聲，鬧成一片。結果，這許多草棚竟爲了看「一塊大洋鈿」而全數燬滅，從此那塊大洋鈿也葬在火燒塲裏。這幕戲，謝俊的表演是特别動人，公映時，當知此言不虚。</p>
<h3>白楊做夢</h3>
<p>銀色的月，銀色的星，銀色的垂柳，銀色的芭蕉，銀色的草地……在這一切都是銀色的園地裏，「十字街頭」的女主角白楊，穿了一件十九世紀法國少女的裝束，露着雪白的肩膀，胳膊，天真的，也是愉快的坐在鞦韆上蕩着。</p>
<p>她心愛的人兒趙丹（「十字街頭」的男主角）來了，她熱情的笑了，舉手向趙丹招呼，趙丹走近她的面前，兩下藴藏在內心裏的愛的火燄熱烈的燃燒起來，緊緊的摟抱着，吻着，吻着。</p>
<p>但是，一聲鷄唱，白楊的夢醒了，她不是，銀色的園裏，心愛的人兒趙丹也影蹤不見了在她感到了失望，悲哀。</p>

<h3>Central Army Advancing Towards Lintong</h3>
<p>Xi'an City Returns to Calm; Sun Mingjiu Reportedly Executed; Many Zhang's Generals Go to Xianyang</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] The Central Army advanced west from Weinan on the morning of the 5th, and is expected to reach Lintong that evening or by noon on the 6th at the latest. The Longhai railway engineering train arrived in Weinan and will follow the army west. The Chishui power line has been repaired, and direct telecommunications between Zhengzhou and Shaanxi will be available on the 5th; however, it is controlled by the Xi'an army and cannot be reported. Yang Hucheng ordered a halt to all military operations. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] The Central Army arrived in Weinan on the morning of the 4th. The Longhai Railway Bureau dispatched a large number of workers to rush the laying of tracks in the western section, and the railway is expected to be open to traffic by the 8th. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] According to reports, most of the Central Army has now advanced to Weinan, and the vanguard is advancing towards Lintong. It is expected to reach Xi'an before the Lunar New Year. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] According to transportation sources, the Chishui Bridge was repaired on the 4th. A large number of road workers were transferred from various sections west of Shanxia Stone Station on the Longhai Railway on the 4th to repair and lay tracks west of Chishui. The railway is expected to be open to traffic around the 8th of this month. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to a certain news agency, Zhang and Yang's troops are expected to retreat to designated locations around the 10th. Gu Zhutong will go to set up a field headquarters only after the Central Army takes over Xi'an. Sun Mingjiu's troops have been disarmed by Yang Hucheng's troops. There is talk that Sun is on the run. The reasons for Sun's riot are partly due to communist agitation and partly because Zhang Xueliang had more than a hundred trusted soldiers who were very well treated, each receiving a monthly salary of sixty yuan. After the reorganization, they could not be paid according to the original amount, so they simply carried out a large-scale looting. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Since the Central Army arrived in Weinan to take over defense, Zhang and Yang's troops have retreated to Lintong, but there is no further news of their withdrawal from Xi'an. Zhang and Yang's troops on the north and south banks of the Wei River are gradually retreating. According to reports from monitoring agencies, the central route goes to Lintong, the left wing to Gaoling, and the Central Army is advancing to take over defense at a distance from the two retreating forces. However, Zhang and Yang's troops in Xi'an are not preparing to withdraw and are still demanding that Zhang Xueliang return to Xi'an to speak before they withdraw. Gu Zhutong is earnestly urging Xu Liang, Li Zhigang, and others in Tongguan. Sun Mingjiu, the leader of the Xi'an riot, is rumored to have been arrested. Order in the city is being gradually restored. Yang Hucheng, He Zhuguo, Miao Chengliu, Liu Duoquan, and others are all in Xi'an. The losses of merchants and civilians in this riot were very heavy. Wang Yizhe, Jiang Bin, Song Xueli, and others were killed or injured. Dozens of lower-ranking officers and soldiers were also killed or injured during the fierce fighting. The situation is currently being investigated. Radical elements are still lurking in the old and new cities of Xi'an, and searches are being conducted daily. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Confirmed news: Sun Mingjiu, the bandit leader of the Xi'an riot, has been executed by Yang Hucheng, to the great satisfaction of the people. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Many senior generals of Zhang's troops have left Xi'an for Xianyang. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: The 120th Division and other units of Zhang's troops north of the Wei River have retreated to the vicinity of Fuping and the area around Leyang. After the 105th Division and other units south of the Wei River crossed the river, they retreated towards Gaoling. It is reported that the planned strategy of that unit is to first retreat to the Fuping-Gaoling line, and then make demands to the Central Army to restore Zhang Xueliang's public rights, give him a position and return him to Shaanxi, etc. There are fears that many problems will arise and the future is uncertain. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: According to aerial reconnaissance, the East Gate of Xi'an and various parts of the city have returned to normal. A small number of soldiers are patrolling the streets. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: The 120th Division of Zhang and Yang's troops stationed in northern Weinan retreated to Fuping, the 109th Division retreated to Leyang east of Gaoling, the 3rd Garrison District withdrew to the vicinity of Xingshi, and the 105th Division in Weinan retreated to Gaoling. The two bandits Zhu De and Mao Zedong are in Xiaoshi, and the whereabouts of Peng Dehuai's bandit troops have not yet been reported. Tan Zixin, commander of the 10th Cavalry Division of Zhang's troops, came to Tongguan to meet with Directors Gu and Chen to express his sincerity. The vanguard of the Central Army will arrive in Lintong to take over defense. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>☉Tongguan: Sun Mingjiu, Miao Jianqiu, Ying Detian, and other masterminds of the December 12th Incident in Xi'an have escaped. During the chaos, Sun and others sent telegrams to the division commanders of Zhang's troops, advocating: ㊀ Unity of the three (Zhang, Yang, and the CCP), fighting to the end; ㊁ Insisting on Zhang Xueliang's return to Shaanxi; ㊂ Absolutely eradicating traitors and implementing the eight demands; ㊃ Publicly recommending Yu Xuezhong as commander-in-chief, Bao Wenwei as director of the staff group, and Ma Zhanshan as cavalry commander; ㊄ Vowing to coexist with the city of Xi'an and never retreat, etc. It is reported that because the East Gate of Xi'an was guarded by Sun's followers, Sun and others were able to escape. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] The Longhai Railway engineering train was still processing and repairing the damaged tracks in Chishui Station on the 5th, and workers were dispatched to repair the steel bridge west of the station. The station is actively preparing to restore traffic on the Tongguan-Xi'an section. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bandit-Puppet Troops in Chabei Reported to Be Moving Towards Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>Local Garrison on High Alert</p>
<p>[Guihua] It is recently reported that the bandit-puppet troops in Chabei are showing signs of moving towards Zhangjiakou, and the local garrison is on high alert. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] The puppet garrison brigade of Bayindelegeer, numbering about 2,000 men, stationed around Nanhouchang, Zhangbei, and Yehuling, returned to Jiabusi on the 4th, presiding over municipal affairs with a passive attitude. Its puppet military headquarters is still located in Shangdu, and the troops are also showing signs of instability. Some parties are now planning to replace Li Shouxin with Yin Baoshan. Qianhai Jiuxiong, the former head of a certain special service agency in Zhangbei, was discovered to have embezzled provisions for Li's troops and has been sent to Changchun for imprisonment.

<h3>Disputes Once Occurred in Kang Tibetan</h3>
<p>Tibetan Troops Occupied Four Counties Including Baiyu on the Jinsha River; the Central Government Resolved the Issue Through Political Mediation; Tibetan Troops Returned to Tibetan Territory; Four Counties Taken Over by Liu's Troops</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Before the Xi'an Incident last year, disputes occurred in Kang Tibetan. While the garrison of Xikang was weak, Tibet dispatched troops to the Jinsha River and occupied four counties, including Baiyu, Dege, Dengke, and Shiqu. Liu Wenhui, Chairman of the Xikang Provincial Construction Committee, was still in Sichuan at the time and was very angry upon hearing the news. He repeatedly telegraphed the central government to deal with the matter according to the law. At that time, in order to prevent the situation from escalating, secrecy was strictly maintained to the outside world and mediation was conducted through political methods. Recently, the matter has been concluded. The Rezheng authorities in Tibet accepted the advice of the central government and sent Counselor Shi Langduo Ji to Kang last year to meet with Liu Wenhui to discuss everything. The result was very satisfactory. The Tibetan side is willing to return the four counties, including Baiyu, to Xikang. Liu then transferred the central part of the 138th Division, led by Zhang Zhen, to take over the defense. The Tibetan troops have retreated back to Tibetan territory. In order to eliminate the estrangement between the two sides, Liu specially dispatched Luo Junxia and Chen Wenhan to be stationed in Changdu to establish contact with Tibet.

<h3>Bandit Attempt to Rob Train on Longhai Railway</h3>
<p>Two Sections of Railroad Track Dismantled by Bandits; Military Police Rushed to the Scene, and Bandits Fled</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Last night, two sections of railroad track between the Liu Di Quan and Yangji Stations on the Longhai Railway were dismantled by bandits in an attempt to rob a train. Upon discovery by the railway, the 11th and 12th trains were diverted to Dangshan and Guide stations. The Xuzhou office immediately telegraphed the railway police and garrison troops at both stations to rush to suppress the bandits. The bandits, numbering over ten, all fled. The Xuzhou Engineering Section dispatched an engineering train to repair the tracks, and traffic has been restored this morning. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Between Yangji and Liudiquan on the Longhai Railway, a gang of bandits was discovered attempting to destroy the road and rob a train on the night of the 4th. They were repelled by the garrison troops rushing to suppress them. It is reported that over a hundred bandits from eastern Henan removed the railroad spikes eight li west of Yangji at 9:00 PM on the 4th and hid on both sides of the railroad, hoping to rob the westward steel train. However, the train was moving quickly and fortunately did not encounter danger, passing safely. The bandits then plotted to intercept the 12th express train at midnight, cutting off the tracks at the same location. This was discovered by the workers and police on the side of the road, who immediately reported it by telephone to the Yangji and Liudiquan stations. The 11th train heading west stopped in Dangshan at 3:00 AM on the 5th, and the 12th train heading east stopped in Liudiquan, not daring to proceed. The railway then notified the garrison troops, tax police corps, and railroad police in Dangshan, Jiangsu Province, and Guide, Henan Province, to rush to suppress them. A fierce battle ensued with the bandits for half an hour that night, and the bandits retreated after being defeated. The Engineering Section rushed to repair the destroyed road overnight, and repairs were completed at 6:00 AM on the 5th. The 12th train arrived in Xuzhou at noon, six hours behind schedule. Fortunately, the railway did not suffer any losses. The railroad military police are continuing to search for the fleeing bandits. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Negotiations for Merger of Two Japanese Proletarian Political Parties Break Down (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Nagumo</p>
<p>㊀ Course of Negotiations</p>
<p>On November 18th of last year, this newspaper introduced the "Japanese People's Front and the Social Mass Party." That was precisely the time when the Labor-Farmer Proletarian Council (hereafter referred to as the Labor Council) and the Social Mass Party were conducting merger negotiations. Now, these negotiations have been declared broken, that is, the Social Mass Party has clearly expressed its rejection of the People's Front movement. (According to recent reports in the Tokyo Metropolitan News, Yomiuri Shimbun, and other magazines.)</p>
<p>The Labor Council initiated this merger movement. The purpose of the merger was to form a united anti-fascist proletarian front movement. Responsible for bringing together the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council were the two leaders of the National Levelers League and the National Farmers Union: Jiichiro Matsumoto and Hisao Kuroda. The merger negotiations lasted for four months.</p>
<p>Firmly opposed to this merger were the Secretary-General of the Social Mass Party, Hisashi Aso, and Komakichi Matsuoka, Chairman of the All-Japan Labor Federation, which supports the Social Mass Party (Metropolitan News). The reasons for the opposition were: ㊀ Non-recognition of the Labor Council as a merger target; ㊁ Differences in political views between the Social Mass Party and Kanjuro Kato (hereafter referred to as Kato), the leader of the Labor Council (Yomiuri Shimbun.)</p>
<p>The breakdown of negotiations is recognized by all parties. What happens after the breakdown? There are two different accounts: Firstly, among the lower-level members of both camps (Social Mass Party and Labor Council), the atmosphere for a merger is already strong, so Matsumoto and Kuroda have jointly requested the leader of the Social Mass Party, Isoo Abe, to reopen negotiations (Metropolitan News); Secondly, the Labor Council believes that the breakdown of negotiations is an opportunity to organize a new political party, and has already begun a vigorous movement, preparing to lobby the whole country in mid-January and hold a national congress for the formation of a new political party in February (Yomiuri Shimbun - January 8th)! Although these two accounts differ, they agree on the point that the Labor Council will not give up the People's Front movement.</p>
<p>㊁ Examination of the Reasons for the Breakdown</p>
<p>The so-called "non-recognition of the Labor Council as a merger target," as explained by the Social Mass Party, means: "Upon joining the party, one must join the affiliated branch in an individual capacity." The Labor Council is a group, not an individual, so it is not recognized as a merger target. The so-called "difference in political views with Kato" means: Kato believes that the objective situation in present-day Japan already has the various conditions for the formation of a People's Front. The Social Mass Party, however, denies the existence of these conditions, and at the same time denies the future of the People's Front.</p>
<p>The Labor Council was formed in the fall of last year. Kato is unwilling to join the Social Mass Party in an individual capacity, only willing to join in a group capacity, which is very clear. Kato's reasons are: First, in order to "stimulate the activism of the anti-fascist faction within the Social Mass Party and break the illusion of the fascist faction within the Social Mass Party," it is necessary to establish a force outside the Social Mass Party to criticize it. Uniting this critical force is also absolutely necessary in promoting the merger movement. To make the Social Mass Party truly become the central force of the People's Front, it can only be realized by first uniting the forces outside the Social Mass Party into a group, and then joining with this group. Second, even before the merger negotiations are successful, there should be an organized and continuous anti-fascist movement. — This is the reason for organizing the Labor Council ("A Road to the People's Front" — written by Kato, published in Chuo Koron, September issue.)</p>
<p>However, Kato's reasons, in the eyes of the Social Mass Party, especially the Aso faction, are exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>Kato said: "Break the illusion of the fascist faction within the Social Mass Party." This in reality is to break the illusion of Hisashi Aso's faction. Hisashi Aso's relationship with the military and his relatively large influence within the Social Mass Party are well-known facts. Before Kato can divide the Aso faction, while shouting about breaking Hisashi Aso's illusion, he also demands to join the Social Mass Party, which is of course rejected by Hisashi Aso, the Secretary-General of the Social Mass Party.</p>
<p>Hisashi Aso and Kato joined the labor movement at the same time (1917). Before 1932, Hisashi Aso and Kato often belonged to the same organization, and in terms of organizational status, Hisashi Aso was above Kato. After the formation of the Social Mass Party in 1932, Kato regarded the Social Mass Party as a fascist organization, and they became increasingly opposed. In the 1936 election, although both of them received more than 50,000 votes, Kato received the most votes among all the congressmen. There is no doubt that Hisashi Aso is increasingly jealous of Kato. When the tide of the People's Front reached Japan, Kato seized the slogan of the People's Front to appeal, and demanded that the Social Mass Party accept the program of the People's Front, Hisashi Aso was of course even more worried about his own leadership position being shaken. However, this is clearly a kind of sectarianism and exclusionism.</p>
<p>In addition to the contradiction between the two individuals—two social forces—becoming the cause of the breakdown, we can also point out several different basic views of the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council regarding the People's Front.</p>
<p>㊀ "Today, those conditions (conditions for forming the People's Front) do not yet exist..." This is what Hisashi Aso said at the roundtable discussion "People's Front or National Front?" — Japanese Review, September issue) ㊁ The current government—military—financial capitalists' suppression of the People's Front movement was long imagined by the Aso faction, so they said: "Forming the People's Front will instead stimulate the government, giving the government an excuse to suppress the labor movement." The Social Mass Party does not dare to develop the labor movement through struggle, but only attempts to develop it in a peaceful attitude of comfort, which is very clear.</p>
<p>In addition, the Social Mass Party is still dreaming of parliamentary struggle. This dream is indeed very sweet now. The result of last year's general election showed a major leap forward for the proletarian faction. In particular, the number of congressmen from the Social Mass Party increased to eighteen, while all other proletarian factions outside the Social Mass Party only gained six seats in total. The Social Mass Party is dreaming of future parliamentary advances, and is very afraid that the People's Front will wake up its beautiful dream.</p>
<p>Calling out socialism, holding on to a portion of the working masses with its left hand, but finding it inconvenient to reject the powerful fascists with its right hand, is the Social Mass Party of today.</p>
<p>Shouting the People's Front, but holding too few of the working masses in its hand, is the Labor Council of today.</p>
<p>Only the working masses themselves can merge the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council.</p>
<p>㊂ Encourage the Relationship Between the Working Masses and the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council</p>
<p>In 1935 (labor statistics for 1936 have not yet been seen), the total number of workers in Japan was 5,906,589. The total number of organized workers was 408,662. That is, organized workers only account for 6.9% of the total number of workers (according to a survey by the Social Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs.) This is enough to show that the organizational power of Japanese workers has not yet been fully developed.</p>
<p>However, these 400,000+ organized workers are not completely united under one or two political parties. There are 993 labor organizations. Among them, only a portion support the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council.</p>
<p>The labor organizations that support the Social Mass Party include: the General Federation of Government Workers Unions, the Japanese Seamen's Union, the All-Japan Federation of Labor Unions, the Seafarers Association, the General Federation of Japanese Farmers Unions, the Japan Harbor Workers Union, the Tokyo Electric Power Employees Union, the Japan Iron &amp; Steel Employees Union, the Japan Pottery Workers Union Federation, and the Tokyo Gas Workers Union, etc. Those who support the Labor Council include: the National Council of Japanese Labor Unions, the National Farmers Union, the North Japan Farmers Union, the Tokyo Municipal Employees Union, and the Tokyo Transportation Labor Federation, etc.</p>
<p>Among these labor organizations, there are those who support both the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council, such as the National Farmers Union and the Tokyo Municipal Employees Union. In short, among the above-mentioned groups, those who express support for the Social Mass Party account for about eight-tenths. Those who support the Labor Council account for about two-tenths.</p>
<p>In addition, there are quite a few labor organizations with fascist characteristics, such as: the Loyalty and Filial Piety Labor Union, the New Japan Seamen's Union, the Tokyo Electric Power Patriotic League, and the Greater Japan Labor Union Council, etc.</p>
<p>If the Social Mass Party can conduct a united front with the Labor Council, and then actively engage in the unorganized worker masses (accounting for 92.1% of the total number of Japanese workers) based on the existing labor organizations, then the future is limitless. In today's Japan, where fascist forces are rising, the sharp antagonism between the Social Mass Party and the Labor Council is undoubtedly weakening the anti-fascist forces. There is no doubt that there are anti-fascist masses within the Social Mass Party. In last year's election, one of the Social Mass Party's slogans was "anti-fascism." This slogan is closely related to the Social Mass Party's advance in parliamentary seats. The reason why Kato received the most votes was even more due to his anti-fascist propaganda.</p>
<p>The so-called "patriotic labor front united movement" was already embodied in 1935. However, the anti-fascist labor front united movement has not seen progress. In addition to various objective reasons, the sectarianism among leaders is indeed a major obstacle.</p>

<h3>Twists and Turns in the Shaanxi Situation and Mediation</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The Shaanxi-Gansu problem, which once caused great concern, has recently taken a sharp turn for the better. The central government has repeatedly declared its intention to be lenient, and Zhang and Yang's troops have also been withdrawing in succession in compliance with orders. The gloom of the situation is gradually dissipating, and the people are finally catching their breath. Just when there were expectations of a smooth and orderly progression without any obstacles, unexpectedly, unpredictable changes emerged again. The city gates of Xi'an were closed, and the sound of gunfire suddenly arose from within, causing the remaining people to suffer another round of panic. The nearly completed agreement suffered an unexpected setback. This was something that ordinary people could never have foreseen. Although this incident was quickly suppressed, and order in Xi'an has been restored, the underlying anxiety in people's hearts has not been eliminated, and the potential for further unrest remains. Since the Shaanxi Incident occurred, there have been so many twists and turns that it has been difficult to resolve, demonstrating the difficulty of dealing with the aftermath.</p>
<p>The truth of this internal strife in Xi'an is still unclear. It is said that it was due to radical elements among the officers of Zhang's troops, who were dissatisfied with the terms of the peaceful resolution and wanted to use coercion to obtain commitments from senior generals to continue their attitude of opposition to the central government. After the senior generals sternly refused, the uprising broke out. Wang Yizhe, the commander of the 67th Army of the Northeast Army, was killed, and the chief of the adjutant's office, Song Xueli, and two others died along with him. After Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and others tried their best to suppress and persuade them, the other troops, angered by Wang's murder, also rose up in opposition. The rioting elements began to retreat outside the city, and the turmoil gradually subsided. Although this matter is not directly related to the central government's handling of the aftermath, at a time when the national crisis is urgent, and we are relying on concentrating all our efforts to serve the country, this unfortunate incident has occurred, foreshadowing a division and weakening of our strength, causing a blow to our morale. And a valiant and skilled general like Wang Yizhe died not on the battlefield, but as a victim of assassination, which is a major loss for the country. Who would not feel distressed and uneasy about this?</p>
<p>The incident arose suddenly and was quelled just as suddenly. On the one hand, this shows the extreme actions of the radical elements, and on the other hand, it shows that there are still many people who understand the situation. However, the greatest driving force, the weight of the invisible mediation, should still be attributed to the collective will of the entire country. The collective will demands unity and peace, and no matter what kind of force rises, it cannot be allowed to repeat the destruction of peace before the external goal has been abandoned. Any action that divides unity will ultimately yield to this collective will. Otherwise, with the lax discipline and chaotic situation of Zhang and Yang's troops, which had already caused a deteriorating situation, how could it have been quelled in such a short period of time? Is it not the collective will for peace and unity that has influenced this? This is true of this incident, and it has been true of past events as well. If the strength of the collective will is not destroyed, there is hope for the restoration of the country's fortunes.</p>
<h3>Eden Goes to Southern France for Two Weeks of Rest</h3>
<p>His duties are delegated to the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to depart for southern France on Saturday for a two-week vacation. During his absence, the position of Foreign Secretary will be temporarily assumed by Lord Privy Seal Viscount Halifax. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding Foreign Secretary Eden's departure to southern France for a two-week rest, the Morning Post recently commented that, "Since German leader Hitler delivered his speech on the 30th of last month, there have been many important unresolved issues, such as Germany's demand for the restoration of its former colonies, which are urgent matters to be dealt with. It is rather strange for the Foreign Secretary to take a vacation at this time. As for his deputy, 'Lord Privy Seal Viscount Halifax, although he has repeatedly served as Acting Foreign Secretary, he is known to have more sympathy for Germany than Foreign Secretary Eden.'"

<h3>Japanese Army Authorities Eager to Implement New National Defense Plan</h3>
<p>Recognize the Urgent Need to Develop Industry; China and Japan Seek to Implement Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Based on the new national defense preparation plan, the Japanese army authorities are attempting to achieve a substantial enhancement of military strength. In order to implement this plan, a strong government is of course necessary, but the army hopes that the Hayashi Cabinet will first decide on its fundamental policy. According to the army's opinion, domestic industry is the foundation of the new national defense enhancement plan, so it places emphasis on its development, and links the development of "Manchukuo" industry with the new national defense enhancement plan as inseparable. It will strive to solve problems closely related to national defense, such as aviation, electricity, fuel, and steelmaking. For this purpose, it will create state organs such as the Ministry of Trade, or establish large semi-official and semi-private trading companies to promote the overseas development of Japanese goods. Therefore, the trend of Japanese politics and economy should also implement major transformations according to this policy. The diplomatic policy towards China should also be based on the harmony of Eastern nations, strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and when the new national defense enhancement plan is completed, it will ease the previous exclusive policy towards the North, and focus on the Southern policy.

Fearing widespread rumors that some within the government still advocate dissolving the parliament, more than forty members of the House of Representatives, led by veteran politician Yukio Ozaki (all of whom are not members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties), submitted a memorandum to the parliament regarding the dissolution of the parliament, rejecting the concept of dissolving the parliament in a way that is unconstitutional, but it is generally believed that this move is only a demonstration. Most of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties do not want to make the situation more complicated, so it is generally believed that after the parliament reopens, if no unexpected events suddenly occur, the situation can be safely passed, and this belief is growing. The candidate for Foreign Minister does not want to be selected before the parliament reopens. The leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently submitted a program for reforming Japan's foreign policy to Prime Minister Hayashi for his reference. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Tentatively Abandons Baba Tax Plan</h3>
<p>To be revised and resubmitted to Parliament</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance held a meeting of the Tax Bureau at the Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 4th. After discussing the previous cabinet's tax reform plan, in view of the actual situation of the financial world and the opinions of various parties, it was recognized that the original plan was not suitable for implementation. Therefore, it was decided to revise it during the parliamentary recess and submit it to the parliament. The fundamental direction of the revision is to alleviate the excessive burden on the people, while at the same time trying not to reduce tax revenue. Two concrete methods are proposed: ㊀ completely abolish Minister Baba's original reform plan and implement a simple increase in tax rates based on the current tax law, while adding some new taxes; ㊁ base on Minister Baba's original plan, modify the inappropriate parts and new taxes, or eliminate useless parts. After discussion, it seems that it was decided to abandon the Baba original plan, base on the current tax law, and adopt the method of increasing taxes and setting up new taxes. In that case, the first type of the second kind of income tax and its combined taxation on the third kind will of course be implemented moderately. Regarding the new tax issue, in Minister Baba's original plan, the transaction tax should be abolished, the property tax should also be completely abolished, or only the part of increasing taxes for corporations should be retained. As for the foreign currency debt, special debt, and securities transfer tax, all will be subject to considerable revisions. Regarding the trade control tax and export control tax, there is still a strong opinion on setting it up. The Ministry of Finance intends to re-examine the national tax and local tax revisions because they are related to the local financial adjustment allocation. (Allied Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Hayashi Selects Full-Time Cabinet Members</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The current Cabinet members of the Hayashi Cabinet, such as Yuki, Yamazaki, and Godo, are mostly concurrent cabinet members. However, in preparation for the reopening of parliament, the Hayashi Cabinet plans to quickly find suitable talents and set up full-time cabinet members in the ministries that are currently held concurrently. It is in the process of searching for candidates, and it has been internally decided to set up a full-time Minister of Communications before the parliament reopens. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education are also scheduled to set up full-time ministers at appropriate times, but the Minister of Railways and the Minister of Colonial Affairs will be temporarily held concurrently by cabinet members.

<h3>Japanese Shipbuilding Industry Booming</h3>
<p>Steel Mills Plan to Increase Production</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Last year, Japanese shipyards received orders for a total of 116 new ships, with a gross weight of 736,250 tons. Ships under 1,000 tons have not been included. At the end of last year, there were a total of 142 ships, totaling 836,950 tons, either under construction or scheduled to begin construction this year. However, due to the shortage of steel, many orders cannot be fulfilled as scheduled. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry currently estimates that the total amount of steel needed in Japan from April this year to the end of March next year is approximately 500,000 tons. Nippon Steel Corporation and several other steel companies have expanded their factory facilities, so it is expected that production can be increased soon to meet the needs of the country. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry currently believes that the recent rise in steel prices is due to manipulation by speculators. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>US Naval Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Faces Stagnation Due to Dispute Between Government and Business</p>
<p>[Washington] The US naval construction plan is on the verge of stagnation due to a dispute between the government and the business community. It is said that steel mills and steel manufacturers are not supplying the necessary materials to the naval authorities as a form of protest against the Walsh-Healey Act. The Act stipulates a 40-hour work week, and this provision and other measures must be observed by manufacturers who want to undertake government projects. However, the steel mills are currently operating at full capacity, and even with a 48-hour work week, they are unable to meet the demand, and are reluctant to reduce working hours by accepting government projects. Government projects are smaller than private orders, and the manufacturers feel that it is not worth it to reduce working hours by accepting government projects. Furthermore, the Navy Department recently announced a tender to purchase 2,735,000 pounds of copper. The authorities received bids for 1,035,000 pounds, but the government could only purchase 885,000 pounds, the rest of which did not comply with the provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act. On December 4th of last year, the naval authorities again wanted to purchase 25 million pounds of steel, but the manufacturers only submitted bids for 7 million pounds, and all had to be rejected because they violated the Walsh-Healey Act. In this situation, if there are no other developments recently, the planned construction of two battleships, each with 35,000 tons, will be impossible to start. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, which is currently building several submarines, is likely to shut down, and the materials stored at the Washington Navy Yard are also gradually becoming scarce. It is reported that the naval authorities consulted with Labor Secretary Perkins, that the manufacturers' bids for steel could be temporarily exempted from complying with the Walsh-Healey Act, but Perkins refused to accept this method, and labor leader Lewis fundamentally opposed this method.

<h3>French Three-Year Naval Construction Program</h3>
<p>Under Consideration by Authorities</p>
<p>[Paris] Naval correspondent Laborie of the "Petit Parisien" newspaper recently published an article on the French Navy, stating that the total tonnage of the national navy is currently 630,000 tons, and is expected to increase to 850,000 tons within a few years, including many of the latest warships. To prevent delays in naval construction, the government intends to request that the parliament pass the naval construction program for the next three years at the same time. Because parliamentary debates on naval construction programs often take a long time, this is the main reason for past delays in naval construction. For example, although the battleship "Dunkerque" is the most superior warship in the world, construction only began after eighteen months of parliamentary debate, due to the opposition of the majority party members to the construction of battleships several years ago. The delay is evident. Furthermore, since the parliament passed a law stipulating that workers should work 40 hours per week, although the number of workers in shipyards has increased by 11%, they still need to work overtime to make up for the shortfall. The government should also train skilled workers to meet urgent needs. As for the government's three-year naval construction program, it is currently under study. The content will roughly include the following types of warships: ⑴ One or two 15,000-ton aircraft carriers, capable of carrying 40 aircraft, with a speed of 30 knots per hour; ⑵ Several 8,000-ton cruisers; ⑶ A squadron of torpedo boats; ⑷ Ten or so first-class and second-class submarines.

<h3>Asian Labor Conference to be Convened</h3>
<p>Council of State Drafts Report Recommending Three Items for Agenda</p>
<p>[Geneva] At the International Labor Conference held in June of last year, a proposal put forward by labor representatives from India and Japan was passed, advocating the convening of an Asian Labor Conference in Asia to seek to develop cooperation between Asian countries and the International Labor Office. It was decided that the Council of the International Labor Office should draft a report. The report has now been drafted and will be jointly reviewed tomorrow by the Asian members of the Council of the International Labor Office. It is reported that the report suggests including the following three issues on the agenda of the Asian Labor Conference: ⑴ The issue of Asian countries participating in the International Labor Organization; ⑵ The impact of industrial development and population conditions in Asian countries on immigration issues; ⑶ The issue of establishing a permanent labor committee for Asian countries. The report also argues that in addition to the participation of countries such as Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, and Siam, the Asian Labor Conference should also include colonial powers from Europe and the Americas, such as the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal. As for the expenses of the Asian Labor Conference, if held in Tokyo, Japan, it would cost approximately 275,000 Swiss francs; if held in Mumbai, India, it would cost approximately 200,000 Swiss francs.

<h3>British Regency Bill</h3>
<p>Passed Third Reading in Lower House</p>
<p>[London] The Regency Bill was unanimously passed for the third reading in the Lower House tonight. When the bill was under consideration by the review committee in the Lower House, it agreed to the amendment proposed by Home Secretary Simon, that is, increasing the necessary number of people required to declare that the monarch is unable to perform his duties and needs to appoint a regent from three to four. However, it was later fixed at three, and the number of people with the power to declare was reduced to five, in order to remove one person who could be a regent. Simon also proposed an amendment, deleting the phrase "the regent should reside in Britain" and replacing it with "should be residing in any part of Britain," in case the appointed regent happens to be serving as the Governor-General of a dominion or temporarily residing in a dominion. This section was also approved by the committee. Simon also stated that in the event that the Emperor travels abroad or is temporarily unable to govern, the State Council should be composed of the Queen, the Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent, the Princess Royal, and Prince Connaught.

<h3>U.S. Pacific Coast Sailors Return to Work</h3>
<p>Strike Lasts 98 Days with Significant Losses; Workers Vote to Approve Interim Measures</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The Sailors' Strike Committee today notified shipping companies on the Pacific Coast that the sailors' strike, which has lasted three months and caused the stagnation of shipping in various ports on the West Coast and Honolulu, has been completely resolved, and the striking sailors will return to work in full force at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. The Joint Committee of the Union also confirmed this news, stating that union workers have completed voting and the majority have approved of ending the strike, so the labor unrest has indeed ended. However, this worker vote did not include firemen, oilers, and cleaners, but the departure of ships will not be delayed as a result. It is reported that the Pacific Coast maritime strike has lasted for 98 days, with losses estimated at around 100 million yuan. The general public is very happy about the end of the strike, but this resumption of work is in fact only a truce, not permanent peace. Several issues remain unresolved, including: ⑴ Firemen's union workers are still dissatisfied with the terms negotiated by the union representatives and the shipping association; ⑵ The strike by barge workers in Los Angeles and San Francisco has not yet been resolved; ⑶ Shipyard workers in San Francisco and Seattle are still on strike; ⑷ Dockworkers in Honolulu are difficult to deal with; ⑸ Weighers, clerks, and inspectors on the West Coast have unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the previously established agreement. Among them, the firemen's strike is more serious, with 1,234 firemen opposing the return to work terms and only 857 in favor, but all agree to temporarily resume work and then resolve the issues of wages and working conditions. Shipping companies and firemen have both informally expressed hope for a satisfactory resolution. (Dispatch from the 4th, National News)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The maritime unions of various U.S. Pacific ports, which went on strike on October 30th of last year due to disputes with employers over wages and employment methods, declared a resolution today after 98 days. The sailors have agreed to return to work immediately. It is reported that this labor unrest spread widely, and maritime unions in various ports along the Atlantic coast also implemented slowdowns in support. During the Pacific ports sailors' strike, commerce stagnated, and even Hawaii and Alaska were affected, with travelers stranded and food supplies running out. The losses suffered by the shipping companies were naturally considerable. Subsequently, the Shipping Commission, the Shipping Association, and the maritime unions conducted negotiations, and it was decided on the 31st of last month that the sailors would hold a vote to resolve the issue. By the time the voting results came out, the sailors had unanimously accepted the interim measures, and the labor unrest that had been delayed for more than three months came to an end.

<h3>U.S. Auto Strike Remains Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Governor's Mediation Ineffective</p>

<p>Detroit: Michigan Governor Murphy attempted to convene meetings between labor and management to mediate the General Motors auto strike, but all three meetings were unsuccessful, so hopes for the strike's resolution have vanished again. The first meeting was held on Wednesday, the second yesterday, and the third last night, lasting all night but failing to break the deadlock. At the same time, the Flint Police Department has recruited 1,000 special police officers, who will be available to serve once the General Motors authorities decide to evict workers occupying the factory. The company authorities have obtained court permission to suppress the workers' actions. To prevent workers from causing trouble after drinking, Flint has banned the sale of alcohol.

<p>Turkish Capital: Official sources have revealed that after Foreign Minister Rushdi, in his capacity as Turkish Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Entente, held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Italy, Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece are likely to sign an Eastern Mediterranean Mutual Assistance and Non-Aggression Pact in the near future. Regarding this matter, Ciano will meet with Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović and Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Metaxas within days. What Rushdi discussed with Ciano in Milan yesterday was the issue of Italy joining the Montreux Convention (according to this convention, Turkey can re-fortify the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus Straits) and the Eastern Mediterranean Pact. In addition, Ciano has no intention of alienating the relationship between Soviet Russia and Turkey. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)</p>

<p>Yugoslavia: In the capital, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, attending the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives, declared, "Our army should have as many as 1.5 million men, which can be called the most elite force in Europe. It will certainly defend the country and not fail in its duties. But it must be stated that although our military and civilians are prepared for any eventuality, we dare not slack off in the slightest. However, the policy of peace will still be promoted unceasingly. Italy is originally in favor of maintaining good relations with our country, and our country, both government and public, also have the same desire. As for the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement concluded at the beginning of last month, which aims to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean, it is naturally related to our country's borders. The British and Italian governments have formally notified our country of the content of the agreement. In addition, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in his speech in Milan at the beginning of November last year, proposed to repair old ties with our country. We are now eagerly awaiting the country to follow up with practical actions. In this way, Italy and Yugoslavia should become good neighbors and be on good terms with each other."

<h3>German Ambassador Performs Nazi Salute to British King</h3>
<p>Violates Diplomatic Conventions</p>
<p>[London] When King George VI received ambassadors and ministers from various countries at Buckingham Palace yesterday, the German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, performed a Nazi salute to him. All the newspapers have commented on this. The Daily Herald reported, "When the palace staff announced the name of the German Ambassador Ribbentrop, the ambassador immediately stepped forward several paces, stood at attention, and extended his right hand, performing a Nazi salute to the King. Then he advanced three steps, stood at attention, and extended his right hand again. Finally, he advanced one step, stood at attention, and saluted as before. The King responded with a bow." The News Chronicle reported, "This incident has caused unease in diplomatic circles. Ribbentrop may resign and return home. Although there are many powerful figures in the British Conservative Party who are friendly with him, most cabinet members said that the ambassador's actions were propaganda for National Socialism and had violated diplomatic conventions. In addition, the ambassador has been traveling between London and Berlin since taking office, failing to reside in his post for a long time, which is also inappropriate. Moreover, the ambassador even participated in drafting the speech given by his head of state Hitler in the House of Commons on the 30th of last month, which is well known to people in Downing Street and therefore makes them dissatisfied."

<h3>German Guarantee of Belgian and Dutch Neutrality</h3>
<p>German Explanation Ambiguous; Fails to Satisfy Belgium</p>
<p>Brussels: "Dernière Heure" recently reported that when German Head of State Hitler gave a speech in the House of Representatives the other day, he said that Germany was prepared to guarantee the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands. The Belgian government, believing that the meaning of this statement was not clear enough, immediately requested the German government to provide a detailed explanation. It is now reported that the German government has submitted a reply, but its content only cites the memorandum sent by Germany to the relevant countries on March 30 of last year (that is, the peace plan proposed by Hitler). In other words, regarding the neutral status of Belgium and the Netherlands, Germany only made empty and general declarations, without providing any concrete suggestions. Therefore, the Belgian authorities believe that this German guarantee is ambiguous, empty, and conditional, and cannot be compared with the concrete and clear guarantees proposed by Britain and France.

<h3>A Surprising Victory for Government Troops Outside Madrid</h3>
<p>Important Trenches in the University District Captured; Fierce Fighting Also Occurred on the Southern Front</p>

This water conservancy issue has caused significant political waves in Hunan Province. The resignation of Finance Director He Hao, and the proposed partial reorganization of the Hunan Provincial Government, are due to this reason. As for Hubei Province, there is even more public outcry because it is "making a drain for itself at the expense of its neighbor." The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission also attaches great importance to this matter and has specially dispatched the Director of the Engineering Department, Sun Liangshi, to Hankou yesterday to go to Hunan for a thorough investigation. It is expected that there will be an appropriate solution in the shortest period. Previously, Ye Kaixin, a senator of the Military Council, returned to Hunan at the end of last year and, together with the old Tianhu Polder directors, borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Hunan Provincial Bank to build Tianhu Polder. The polder covers an area of over 400,000 mu, approximately 13% of the existing Dongting Lake area. The first to oppose it was the Hunan Flood Relief Committee, whose rationale was that they have been planning Dongting Lake water conservancy for years. Although they have not been able to carry out large-scale dredging due to funding issues, local projects such as the Zhucikou diversion canal, widening of the Hao River and the Linzi and Liangko openings, and the establishment of hydrological stations have been carried out successively and have been somewhat effective. Now, suddenly, while talking about water conservancy, they are building Tianhu Polder, reclaiming Datu Lake, and blocking part of the existing entire lake area. How is this different from building a lake on one side and blocking a lake on the other, preventing disasters on one side and creating disasters on the other? Therefore, a meeting of the entire committee was convened, and it was decided to send a letter to the Hunan Provincial Government to request relief, so as to preserve the lake area and reduce disasters. The Hunan Provincial Government then invited Hunan University professor and Flood Relief Committee engineer Xiao Guangjiong, together with committee member Zhou Fengjiu, to conduct a survey. According to the report, it was also believed that the polder should not be built. Other oppositions followed, like clouds rising. The people of the counties along the river in Hubei Province believe that if the polder is built, the water storage capacity of Dongting Lake will naturally decrease. If the Yangtze River rises and Dongting cannot accommodate it, it will drive eastward, and Hubei Province will bear the brunt. The massive disaster that will be caused in the future will not be comparable to that of the 20th year of the Republic. This policy of benefiting oneself at the expense of one's neighbor is absolutely unacceptable, and a telegram has been sent to all parties resolutely opposing it. Recently, the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Authority expressed its opinion on the matter, stating, "Dongting Lake is the original natural reservoir in the Hunan and Hubei regions, relying on Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi, Tiaoxian, and Chenglingji and Hukou, to regulate the flow of the river. The original water storage area of the lake was 6,780 square kilometers, of which 2,340 square kilometers were occupied by polders, accounting for more than one-third of the total area. Moreover, the lake fields in Yiyang, Xiangyin, Yuanjiang, Hanshou, Nanxian, Changde, Huarong, Anxiang, Lixian, Yueyang, and Linxiang, which border the lake, account for more than 50% of the cultivated land in these counties. Every time a silt island appears, the gentry and wealthy people individually or jointly obtain licenses from the Lake Field Bureau, paying only a few jiao per mu, and then they can reclaim it. According to the Anxiang County Chronicle, during the Daoguang and Tongzhi years, Anxiang had only 14 lake polders. Fifty years ago, there were only over one hundred polders. Now, Anxiang has reached more than six hundred and thirty lake polders, with a total cultivated area of over 600,000 mu. The establishment of Nanxian County is only forty years in history. Initially, it should be in the ninth capital of Huarong, called Nanzhou Hall. Later, siltation increased daily, cultivated land gradually increased, and the population became more numerous, so the county seat was changed. The speed of new polders can be seen from this. The unplanned construction of Tianhu Polder this time is actually competing with water for land, making the reservoir smaller and smaller, and the capacity is decreasing. The future is dangerous, and it is truly unimaginable. If we want to seek urgent relief, the Hunan Provincial Government must follow President Chiang's proposal in the 20th year of the Republic to return the fields to the lake, and the recently promulgated Outline and Implementation Measures for the Consolidation of Farmland Water Conservancy by the Executive Yuan. Decisively prohibit construction and hope that the Economic Committee will comprehensively determine the water distribution area between Hunan and Hubei provinces, and no silt islands may continue to be reclaimed. The original island lake polders and dikes within the water distribution area should be abolished or restricted in height, so that they are one or two meters lower than the main dike, so as to avoid the increasing flood disaster, and the phenomenon that the Yangtze River rises slightly every year, and reports of floods are reported everywhere, officials and people are busy and panicked, and China and foreign countries are shocked can also be expected to be avoided.” (February 3)</p>
<h3>Continued Criticism of Illegal Mining of Iron Ore Near Xiamen</h3>
<p>Not Yet Proven That the Background is a Certain National; Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Survey and Start Mining</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence - It was reported earlier that Lu Zancheng, the head of the Jianyuanyuan Mining Cooperative, was mining without permission at the Saizai Mountain mine pit in Huli Village (also known as Zhukeng Lake Village) in the Heshan Special Zone outside Xiamen City. It has now been discovered that Lu signed a contract with Yang Fubin, the representative of the Yang surname villagers in Zhukeng Lake, on behalf of the cooperative, and Yang Qingmao, the village chief of Zhukeng Lake, signed as a witness. The contract was signed on December 23rd and 24th of last year. Mining exploration had already started half a month before the signing. By the time it was cracked down on January 19th, it had become a mine pit with a diameter of one zhang and a depth of seven zhang, with a horizontal excavation depth of two zhang at the bottom of the pit. According to Lu, the ore is manganese ore, but the Xiamen Star Daily reported at the time that it was tungsten ore and claimed that there was a background of a certain party, and the mined ore was being smuggled out of the port, etc. According to Liu Jitang, the director of the Special Zone Office, Lu had come to the office to register before excavating the mine, but had not yet been approved. Lu and others had already started work without authorization. This point is already illegal. The most important thing at present is whether Lu has a background or not, which must be strictly investigated. As for Yang Fubin and Yang Qingmao, they have been granted bail on the grounds of ignorance. Lu is still in custody. Lu's hometown is Quanzhou. As for whether his mining has a background, it has been more than half a month, and there is still no confirmation. It is still under investigation by the Special Zone Office. As for the quality of the ore in the pit, Chen Gaozhi, a technician sent by the Construction Department, confirmed that it was hard manganese, not tungsten ore. Lu and others had just approached the ore vein and had not yet reached the ore layer, so they had not yet had time to steal it. It is reported that hard manganese can be used for steelmaking. Although its need for military industrial is not as important as tungsten, it is also one of the military raw materials, so its value is very high. The provincial government has now sent technician Li Qishan to Xiamen in the coming days to conduct a detailed survey and start mining. As for the report here that a certain national is the background, it has not yet been proven. However, it is suspicious for a private individual to invest in mining exploration in order to seek uncertain profits. Also, the miner Li Wenying is currently a technician at the Anxi Zhongyu Mining Company and has lived in Taiwan. Whether he is Taiwanese and what kind of person he is, and the identity of an unknown shareholder in the cooperative, are all highly suspicious. (February 5).</p>
<h3>Sichuan and Guangdong Provinces Purchase and Transport Large Quantities of Rice in Anhui</h3>
<p>Anhui and Jiangxi Establish Tea Trade Company in Shanghai; Local Banks Provide Industrial and Commercial Loans</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence – Due to the bumper agricultural harvests in Anhui Province last year, the output of rice has increased sharply, the rural economy has been activated, and various businesses have also shown a trend of prosperity. Recently, during the abandoned lunar New Year, there is an unprecedented atmosphere of prosperity. The market is very stable, and the official support and promotion are even more exciting. I will describe the recent trends in rice and tea sales, and the status of local banks implementing industrial and commercial loans, so that you can know that Anhui Province's commerce and finance are making great efforts to move forward.</p>
<p>Guangdong Province has recently experienced another rice shortage, so officials and merchants are actively purchasing rice in Wuhu to transport to Guangdong to provide disaster relief for the people. Officials are commissioned by the Central Trust Bureau to be collected by the Wuhu Central Bank, and 45,000 shi have been purchased successively and transported. Recently, another 40,000 shi have been purchased and stored. Today, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will ship 20,000 shi by sea first. The merchants are the Guangchao rice shops stationed in Wuhu, who are also actively bidding for purchase. From autumn to now, over 1 million shi have been transported to Guangdong. According to statistics, various shops still have over 200,000 shi in stock waiting for transportation. However, at this time, Sichuan Province upstream has also experienced a serious rice shortage, and rice prices have soared, and there is no goods to meet the market. Therefore, the Sichuan Provincial Government has specially sent Commissioner Wei Wenhan and Chen Qidong, the section chief of the Agricultural Bureau, to Wuhu to purchase 30,000 shi of rice from Anhui to transport to Sichuan to rush for price control. The first batch of 5,500 shi has been exported yesterday, and purchases will continue in the future. The authorities of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces have decided to expand the sales of tea this year through consultation, and all measures have been determined. The Bank of Communications has decided to lend 2.5 million yuan, which will be paid by the Anhui Provincial Local Bank Jiangxi Yumin Bank. Recently, officials and businessmen in the two provinces have agreed to establish a tea trade company in Shanghai to facilitate sales abroad. The regulations are being drafted, and it can be established after the new tea is launched this year. As for manufacturing improvement, the government has decided to establish large-scale tea factories in the center of each tea-producing area, purchase machinery, and carry out rationalized large-scale manufacturing, so as to reduce costs and standardize quality, and compete with teas from India, Ceylon, and Java in the international market. The Qi Dou Tea Improvement Farm has compiled a design for a 10,000-box black tea manufacturing factory and submitted it to the Construction Department for review and implementation.</p>
<p>In order to promote the widespread development of industry and commerce, the Anhui Local Bank has specially launched small industrial and commercial loans. The total amount of loans is tentatively set at 20,000 yuan each in Wuhu, Huaining, and Bengbu, and 10,000 yuan each in Xuan city, Guangde, Nanling, Shouxian, Chu county, Hefei, and Shucheng. The maximum amount of each household loan is limited to 500 yuan, the term shall not exceed three months, and the monthly interest rate is 1%. Borrowers must seal up goods as collateral and must be guaranteed by the county government, chamber of commerce, or trade association. The Wuhu General Bank has telegraphed the above-mentioned branches or offices yesterday to carefully handle in accordance with the regulations and methods from now on. In addition, the bank plans to issue one-jiao, two-jiao, and five-jiao transfer notes, which are currently being printed and will be issued soon to regulate the market. (4th)</p>

<p>On the night of the 3rd, twenty-odd robbers, speaking in Hakka dialect, dressed in short clothes, long robes, and worn-out military uniforms, robbed the house of Li Ke’ren, a farmer in Panqiao Township, District 3. They tied up Li, poured oil on him, and burned him, forcing him to reveal where he had hidden his money. His skin was burnt and festered. Li’s son sneaked out to beat a gong and raise the alarm. Upon hearing the sound, the villagers rushed to capture the robbers with farming tools. The robbers were ransacking boxes and cabinets. When the crowd arrived, they stopped robbing and fled. A villager named Wang Da bravely stepped forward to capture them, but was shot in the abdomen by the robbers. He immediately bled and fell to the ground. After the robbers left, he was sent to the Baolong Hospital in Shanghai for treatment. The bullet was still in his abdomen and had not been removed. His life was in danger. It is also heard that the loss from Li’s robbery was not small.</p>
<p>Construction of Highway Connecting Jiading, Qingpu and Songjiang</p>
<p>For the sake of convenient transportation, the governments of Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality have jointly built a highway connecting the three counties of Jiading, Qingpu, and Songjiang. This county starts from the Waigang Station of the Xihu Road, goes southwest across the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, passes through Anting and goes to Qingpu.

On the 4th, he took a boat to the southern town of Quanzhen to purchase a large batch of New Year's goods. On the way home at 4 pm, the boat passed through Wutangmen, and happened to meet a Huifeng steamship passing by. Hongqing immediately used a pole to hook the steamship's side, but the boat body was swaying and unstable. When it reached the turning point of the Duzhong Bridge, the whole boat capsized, and more than a dozen members of the family on the boat all fell into the river.

<h3>US University of California Joint Basketball Team Performs in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Won Against Shanghai Mixed Team by Forty to Twenty-Eight Points; US Team's Swift and Well-Coordinated Moves Admirable</p>
<p>The University of California Joint Basketball Team, invited to perform in the Philippines, passed through Shanghai yesterday on their way back to the United States. The sports news department of the Western Shanghai Continental Daily specially invited them to give a performance and organized a Chinese-Western mixed team to compete against them last night at the Shen Garden. Throughout the game, the situation was extremely tense. In the second half, the score was tied four times, which shows its intensity. However, in the last three minutes, things took a sharp turn for the worse, and the American team scored twelve points in a row, thus defeating the Shanghai Mixed Team by a score of forty to twenty-eight. In the first half, the All-Star Team was only ahead by three points, with a score of eighteen to fifteen. Both sides showed their unique performances, which were exceptionally brilliant. The team will take the original Chichibu Maru to Japan today and then return to the United States.</p>
<p>The Color of the Visiting Team</p>
<p>The University of California team's tactics, like Shanghai's Mai Ling, are exceptionally swift. When they reach the opponent's basket, the five players move like a well-coordinated machine, seeking gaps to enter, and mostly shooting under the basket, rarely shooting from afar. They all wave their hands with a single hand and hit the basket. Unfortunately, there are still some deficiencies in their shooting accuracy, perhaps due to unfamiliarity with the venue or being in a foreign land for the first time. Center Howell, who is over six feet tall, is not particularly special. However, the two forwards, Browning and Moss, are terribly active. In a word, the team's technique is simply swift and well-coordinated.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Team is Very Good</p>
<p>The Shanghai Mixed Team invited Li Zhenzhong and Yin Hongxiang to Shanghai to help. It was not until a few minutes before the game that they arrived. The Shanghai Mixed Team is also made up entirely of all-stars. In the first half, they were unable to score many times due to a lack of coordination. Among the forwards, there was still something missing. Locke was too stiff, and Feng Nianhua was too short. However, the individual skills of the other four players, Li Zhenzhong, Shi Guiya, Yin Hongxiang, and Carson, were not inferior to those of the American team. The performances of Li, Yin, and Carson were particularly unique. The fierceness of their competition can be imagined to give the opponent four ties. If they add more well-coordinated teamwork, there is a great hope of defeating the American team.</p>
<p>Only Three Points Behind</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong's jump ball was not weaker than the opponent's tall man. After the game started, Yin Hongxiang got the first throwing opportunity, but unfortunately it did not go in. Moss fouled, and Yin first made a free throw, opening the record. As it was for several minutes, they failed to score. After the American team called a timeout, Li Zhenzhong added two more points, and the Shanghai team suddenly took the lead with a score of three to zero. The game was tense, and the American team did not seem to score. The difference between the two sides was only one, two, or three points. The Shanghai team was only slightly behind. The American team added Widdis to replace center Howell, and the Shanghai team also replaced Locke with Shi Guiya. At the end of the first half, the American team was only ahead by three points with a score of eighteen to fifteen.</p>
<p>Tied Four Times</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Locke replaced Feng Nianhua, and Howell was re-appointed as the opponent's center. Both sides committed numerous fouls, each scoring with free throws. Carson and Li Zhenzhong scored three free throws in a row, and the Shanghai team made their first tie at eighteen each. The performances of both sides entered a better state, with scores of eighteen each, twenty each, and even twenty-six each, and the shape of the match was extremely tense. At this time, Yin Hongxiang got a chance to foul the opposing captain Browning, but unexpectedly, he missed both free throws, which was a pity. On the other hand, Browning waved his hand with a single hand and scored, and the American team was two points ahead again with a score of twenty-eight to twenty-six. Carson scored, and it was a tie again. With only three minutes left to the end, the American team suddenly showed their power, and Browning and Howell scored one after another, so their momentum became unstoppable. The Shanghai team lost twelve points in a row and lost by a score of twenty-eight to forty.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Manila</h3>
<p>(A dispatch from our reporter in the Philippines, Yan Wenchou)</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Manila) The Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation, in order to enhance the observation of the Philippine basketball team, specifically invited the alumni basketball team of the University of Southern California to come to Manila for eight matches. The team accepted the invitation and arrived in Manila on the eleventh day of the first month, a group of eight people. Except for one player who was a basketball player from the University of Iowa, the rest were all players from the University of California. However, none of them had attended the World Games this time. Their physique was extraordinary and mighty, the tallest being six feet one inch, and the shortest being five feet nine inches. The heaviest weighed one hundred and ninety pounds, and the lightest weighed one hundred and sixty-five pounds, which were indeed unmatched by Orientals. The guard could almost reach the basket with a single jump. The result of the matches was seven wins and one loss. Their loss was only by one point, which can also be said to be a complete victory. The results of each match are detailed below:</p>
<p>President's Reception</p>
<p>On the day of arrival in Manila, they went straight to the Presidential Palace to pay respects to Philippine President Quezon. Due to his ill health, the Secretary-General came out to receive them. President Quezon granted another audience on the morning of the twelfth, extending great comfort to the team for their long journey. They stayed at the YMCA of the U.S. Army and Navy in the Philippines. The Athletic Federation wholeheartedly took on the responsibility of entertaining them.</p>
<p>Changing Basketball Skills</p>
<p>During the first match, they played lightly and sketched casually, without any effort, which greatly dissatisfied the audience. It seemed that with such slow passing, they would definitely be defeated by the Philippine team. Sure enough, in the second match against the Philippine basketball runner-up, the San Beda University team, they lost by a narrow margin. The general audience was even more disappointed. In the third match, the Philippine basketball champion team, the San Sebastian College–Recoletos team, which has always been known for its iron army, came out to play. The Philippine team that attended this World Games was based on this team. That night, the audience was especially large. Before the tip-off at 1:30, all the seats were filled, and more than a thousand people could not get in. The psychology of the audience this time was to watch the San Sebastian College–Recoletos players show off their skills and defeat this burly and mighty American team, not leaving a single piece of armor intact. However, the reality was even more unexpected. That night, the American team, also at a critical juncture where its reputation was at stake, changed its strategy, focusing on tight passing and accurate shooting to win. Despite the San Sebastian College–Recoletos team's exhausted screams and the cheers of the Filipino crowd throughout the arena, they were ultimately unable to reverse the defeat.</p>
<p>Crowded Audience</p>
<p>After defeating the champion San Sebastian College–Recoletos team, the fans were even more excited. Therefore, the seats for the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh matches were all reserved in advance. The Rizal Memorial Basketball Coliseum can only accommodate more than 8,000 spectators, divided into four classes with prices of one peso and five centavos, one peso and two centavos, eight centavos, and four centavos. The first two classes of seats have numbers and can be reserved in advance. The third and fourth classes are seated on a first-come, first-served basis. Because there was a problem of overcrowding in the third and fourth matches, those who arrived late were left out. Therefore, later, people brought bread to fill their stomachs and occupy seats three hours before the start of the game. The arena also widely set up bulletin boards, and the results of each point were announced outside, so that those who could not get in could also know the situation in the arena and feel comforted rather than running in vain.</p>
<p>Audience's Mischief</p>
<p>Filipinos watch basketball games entirely to cheer for their own side, without respecting the visiting team. In the past, when our country's teams went to the Philippines to compete, the bad impressions were always caused by the Filipino audience's unreasonable jeering, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the overseas Chinese audience and led to disputes. This time, they also wanted to use unreasonable ridicule to make the American team angry and disrupt their formation. In the seventh match against the World Games team, when the Filipino referee penalized the Philippine team with a free throw, the audience was in an uproar, accusing him of being unfair and throwing fruit peels and miscellaneous objects into the arena like butterflies flying around. The police also didn't know whether to laugh or cry and couldn't stop them, forcing the American team to almost leave the arena immediately and end the game. Fortunately, the authorities of the Athletic Federation came out to explain everything before the game could continue to the end. In the eighth match, until the end of the second quarter, the Philippine team was leading by four points, and the audience cheered wildly, almost shaking the walls, thinking that they could avenge their shame. Unexpectedly, the American team responded calmly and showed amazing skills, finally turning defeat into victory, which made thousands of Filipinos very dejected.</p>
<p>Filipino Revenue</p>
<p>The round-trip expenses for the American team this time were only about 8,000 Philippine pesos. It is estimated that nearly 30,000 pesos can be collected from the eight matches. The surplus earned by the Athletic Federation this time is considerable.</p>

<h3>Final Trial Match for Interport Football</h3>
<p>Western Team vs. Chinese Team Today at Shen Garden</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese football team will play against the Western interport team at 3:00 PM today at Shen Garden for a practice match. The referee is Mr. Butler, and the linesmen are Chen Jixiang and Nadell. The lineup of the interport team has been temporarily arranged as the final test for the official lineup. Chen Zhenhe and Sun Jinshun of the Chinese team are unable to go to Hong Kong to play due to unforeseen circumstances, and Wang Kehou will supplement them. Zhang Rongcai's foot injury has not healed, and he may not be able to handle the entire game, so Zhou Qinghui will replace him. On the Western team side, Yaxu injured his knee and may not be able to attend. He will accompany the team to Hong Kong as a non-playing captain. Rouier de Trélazé has been sent to the hospital due to illness and cannot go to Hong Kong. The Western Club has selected William Watt as a replacement. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>

<h3>Zhu Qiliang Wins Amateur Billiards Group A Championship</h3>
<p>Result: 2,000 Points vs. 1,961 Points Zhang Yingda Strived Repeatedly but Ultimately Failed</p>
<p>Zhu Qiliang, with his calm spirit and careful technique, finally defeated Zhang Yingda in the extremely tense final stage, reaching the 2,000-point mark first and winning this year's Shanghai Amateur Billiards Group A Championship. This is also the great reward for Zhu's years of hard work and practice, and his golden age is gradually appearing. Zhu should strive for further progress to achieve greater success.</p>
<p>Zhu's initial victory over Ding Mingyi relied on good luck. At that time, Zhu was more than 150 points behind, but in the last few shots, Zhu took the lead. In the semi-finals, Zhu calmly defeated Wu Chengxiang and won the right to the finals. In the final four matches, Zhu benefited from the second match, winning more than 220 points. In the first and third matches, the two sides were neck and neck, with limited differences. The fourth match was quite unfavorable, but fortunately, he had won too many points. Even when he was at a disadvantage, he was still able to cheer up and maintain his composure. The championship title belonged to him. At the beginning of this Group A Championship, Medina was originally the most popular, followed by Zhang Yingda and Ding Mingyi. Unexpectedly, Zhu Qiliang emerged as a dark horse, defeating Ding and Zhang in succession and replacing them. This can be said to be an anomaly.</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda, last year's runner-up, was once again controlled by his bad luck and missed the golden opportunity. In the last 100-point competition, he still ranked second. When the third match started yesterday, the two sides were on the same level. The fourth match then changed greatly. Zhang went from being 235 points behind (1290 vs. 1545) to discovering huge scores of 65, 34, 45, 34, 37, etc., winning more than 40 points and surpassing Zhu (1716 vs. 1676). Unexpectedly, Zhang was careless many times and missed many good opportunities. Zhu then soared again, scoring 79 points in one shot and taking the lead again. From then on, Zhang was still in adversity, following behind Zhu. When the score reached 1909 vs. 1971, another opportunity for a comeback came. He had already scored 52 points in one shot. Unexpectedly, at the critical moment, he missed the opportunity. Zhu then reached the final goal of 2,000 points, winning only 39 points more than Zhang Yingda. The last match lasted the longest, starting at 9:15 and ending at 12:45.</p>
<p>Zhu Qiliang (Front Row) 42, 29, 35, 24, 21, 16, 40, 25, 38, 24, 29, (Back Row) 27, 24, 79, 20, 27, 24</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Formulates Measures to Promote Vocational Supplementary Education</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 5th) The Ministry of Education issued an order to all departments and bureaus, stating that the promotion of vocational education in various provinces and cities has recently laid a foundation. However, it is urgent to supplement the knowledge and skills that workers and apprentices who are already engaged in vocational work should have in order to increase work efficiency. Those who volunteer to engage in vocational work will be taught vocational knowledge and skills so that they can have the opportunity to serve. The Ministry has promulgated the regulations on vocational supplementary schools and ordered them to be followed. In the past three years, various provinces and cities have paid little attention to this educational facility. Now, the Ministry has formulated the outline of measures for various provinces and cities to promote vocational supplementary education and issued them together. Please follow them and prepare detailed implementation measures before the end of March and submit them to the Ministry for approval. The main points of the outline of measures for vocational supplementary education are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The educational administrative organs of all provinces and cities should follow the provisions of this outline of measures to earnestly promote vocational supplementary education and prepare detailed implementation measures and submit them to the Ministry for record.</p>
<p>2.  Regarding the establishment of vocational supplementary schools, 甲. All vocational schools, rural normal schools, and secondary normal schools with special labor equipment should make use of their original equipment and talents to do their best to run vocational supplementary schools with the same nature as the schools. 乙. Universities and specialized schools should hold advanced vocational primary supplementary classes or short-term vocational training classes to provide in-depth subject supplementary studies for those who already have jobs. 丙. All vocational groups in various industries should cooperate with vocational schools and other equivalent schools to make use of school equipment to run vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes related to this industry. Those industries that have not organized groups should quickly organize and hold this major industry. 凡. Universities, specialized schools, vocational schools, and rural normal schools that run vocational supplementary education should be listed as extension undertakings. The number of classes run should be determined according to the capacity of the school's equipment. The location of the school is not limited to the school. 戊. The subjects attached to vocational supplementary schools at all levels should, in addition to being of the same nature as the schools, also pay close attention to the needs of the local area. The attached subjects, such as agricultural vocational schools and rural normal schools, should run agronomy, animal husbandry, cooperation, and other subjects. Vocational and girls' secondary normal schools should run home economics, childcare, sewing, and domestic helper subjects. 己. The surplus of vocational supplementary schools and vocational training classes should all comply with the provisions of the regulations on vocational supplementary schools and the interim measures for short-term vocational training classes promulgated by the Ministry.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding the teachers of vocational supplementary schools, 甲. In addition to the teachers designated by the school to teach, the vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes attached to schools at all levels can also select high-grade students with excellent grades to assist in teaching. When necessary, technical personnel and artists from various industries may be hired to teach. 乙. The teaching subjects of vocational supplementary schools and vocational training classes should be in accordance with the regulations of vocational supplementary schools and the interim measures for short-term vocational training classes promulgated by the Ministry.</p>
<p>4.  Regarding the funding of vocational supplementary schools, 甲. The funding for vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes run by schools at all levels should be based on the principle of saving expenses from the original budget. The expenses for practical materials and hiring full-time teachers may be requested from the competent authorities for subsidies when necessary. The funding for vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes run by vocational groups should be raised by the groups themselves. If the operation is successful, they may apply to the competent authorities for appropriate subsidies. 5. Regarding the implementation steps of vocational supplementary schools, 甲. All provinces and cities should first select appropriate schools in the prosperous industrial and commercial areas of the provinces and cities to run vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes. After they are successful, they should gradually expand and establish them. 乙. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, all vocational schools, rural normal schools, and vocational groups in various specialized schools and above, except for those that have been approved to postpone by the competent educational administrative organs due to special circumstances, should be held. 丙. All provinces and cities should register and assess technicians in various industries and, when necessary, concentrate them for short-term training to determine the preparation of teachers for vocational supplementary schools.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Achievements of the National Economic Council's Cotton Control Commission Since its Establishment</h3>
<p>Promote Cotton Production and Improve Quality, Strive to Export and Save Imports</p>
<p>The National Economic Council's Cotton Control Commission has been established for three years. Its mission is to promote cotton production and improve quality, not only to achieve self-sufficiency but also to strive for exports to save imports and develop the national economy. Last year, my country's cotton harvest increased significantly, which is the result of the commission's three years of hard work. Other efforts, such as textile experiments, are also in progress. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Main Work</p>
<p>The main work of the Cotton Control Commission is to promote cotton fields and improve quality. Therefore, the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute was first established, and a cotton farm was set up in Xiaolingwei, Nanjing, to engage in fine-staple upland cotton and German-American cotton breeding and various research work. A breeding and propagation farm was attached to Dongtai to plant Golden American cotton. Subsequently, cotton production improvement institutes were established in Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces, with thirteen cotton farms attached to cultivate Sizi, Tuozi, Dezi, and Jinzi American cotton and Lingbao cotton for breeding and propagation to meet the needs of promotion. In the past few years, the number of acres of American cotton promoted in Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Hebei, Gansu, and other provinces totaled 570,200 mu in the 23rd year, 1,288,454 mu in the 24th year, and 2,676,025 mu in the 25th year. Among them, Shaanxi Province accounted for the largest number of acres. After the strict implementation of the prohibition of opium cultivation, changing to cotton cultivation was the most suitable crop, so the increase in cotton fields was particularly rapid. Jiangsu Province promoted American cotton the earliest, reaching 300,000 mu in the 23rd year and 600,000 mu in the 25th year, an increase of one time. Henan and Shanxi provinces increased by about ten times. Other provinces have gradually promoted it after the establishment of the provincial improvement institutes, and the number is also very large.</p>
<p>Organize Cooperatives</p>
<p>In order to facilitate promotion, the association guided farmers in various provinces to organize cooperatives. In Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces, there were a total of 40 cooperatives in the 23rd year, with a total of 23,444 members and a total of 308,685 mu of cotton fields. In the 24th year, it increased to 75 cooperatives, with a total of 53,059 members and 856,668 mu of cotton fields. Last year, there were not many changes in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi provinces. Hebei Province added nearly 700 cooperatives, and Hubei Province newly organized about 190 cooperatives. The two provinces added about 50,000 members and about 500,000 mu of cotton fields. The cooperative loans are provided by the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate organized by the banking community in this city. The total amount of loans in the past three years is about 4 million yuan. To facilitate the sale of cotton by various cooperatives, the association has established a cotton transportation and sales office in Shanghai. In the past three years, it has handled the sale of about 100,000 dan of cotton.</p>
<p>Improve Cotton Spinning</p>
<p>In order to study and improve the cotton spinning industry, there has long been a proposal to establish a cotton industry experiment hall. At that time, the National Central Research Institute also had a plan to set up a textile experiment factory. After consultation, it was decided to jointly establish it. A certain area was designated in the south of the Institute of Science and Technology of the Central Research Institute in Shanghai, and construction began at the end of the 23rd year. The total budget was 1.2 million yuan in national currency, divided into three phases. The initial equipment cost was 400,000 yuan, the base construction cost was 160,000 yuan, and the construction and equipment cost was 240,000 yuan. By July of the 25th year, the factory buildings were built, and the textile machines were selected and purchased from various countries, including 31 units for the spinning department, such as various cleaning, combing, fine combing, roving, and spinning machines, and 71 units for the weaving department, such as various winding, jacquard, and fabric finishing machines. They were also installed and tested one after another at this time. At first, 42-count double-strand yarn was spun and ordinary fine cloth was woven. Now, 50-60 count yarn is being spun and various fine products such as straight tribute flannel and jacquard are being woven. The experiment department is equipped with various cotton fiber testing machines, yarn count measuring scales, temperature measuring scales, cotton yarn and cotton cloth strength and elongation testing machines, and more than 70 fabric bursting, ventilation, waterproof shrinkage, and length dyeing fastness instruments, mainly to test the products of each department of the hall. Many people outside also said that they wanted to request analysis and inspection.</p>
<h3>The Elevation of the Status of the Chinese and Belgian Envoys Will Be Realized This Autumn</h3>
<p>Jules D'Anethan Will No Longer Return to His Post</p>
<p>According to sources in diplomatic circles here, the relationship between China and Belgium has become increasingly close in recent years. The authorities of the two countries are currently proceeding with the elevation of the status of their envoys to each other. Before his vacation back to his country last year, Jules D'Anethan, the Belgian Minister to China, had several consultations with the authorities of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and both parties expressed their approval. However, after the status of the envoys is elevated, all light expenses will inevitably increase accordingly, so it must be approved by the central meetings of both countries before it can be realized. Minister D'Anethan has reported the results of his several consultations with our Ministry to the Belgian authorities after returning to his country. It is expected that it can be realized this autumn. After Minister D'Anethan returned to his country, he has been transferred to an internal position and it has been decided that he will no longer come to China.</p>

<h3>The Taxpayers' Association Sent a Letter Requesting the Municipal Council to Curb the Increase in Water Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, approved the joint letter from the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Shanghai Farmers' Association, the Shanghai General Labor Union, the Shanghai Women's Association, the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association, the Shanghai Tenants' Association, the Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Federation, and the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Consumption Association, stating that since the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company changed the water fee from a 25% discount to a 20% discount on February 1 of this year, which is an increase in debt, all users have strongly opposed it due to the increase in burden. On January 30, a joint meeting of representatives of various groups was held, and it was generally believed that tap water is a drink for all residents, and this public utility should aim at public welfare. In recent years, Shanghai has been affected by the January 28 Incident, and industry and commerce have been depressed, and vacant houses are lined up. Residents have launched a rent reduction movement to maintain the status quo. However, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, disregarding the difficulties of the times, suddenly took advantage of the low exchange rate at this time to deceive the Municipal Council into changing the discount and implementing the increase in tariffs. It has been decided to strongly negotiate with the municipal government and request the Taxpayers' Association to argue on the basis of reason in the case. Correspondingly, the letter stated that your association should quickly strive for the Municipal Council to achieve the purpose of canceling the price increase to maintain the market. In this time of general decline in social economy, and at a time when the world is seeking stability, fair agencies should have extraordinary rulings on actions that sacrifice the public and seek self-interest, in order to comply with public opinion and avoid accumulating resentment. The letter is approved for the above reasons, and a corresponding letter is hereby sent, hoping that you will take note and comply with public opinion."</p>
<h3>Prelude to Planting Cotton on Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Representatives from the National Economic Council, etc., Are Scheduled to Depart on the 11th</p>
<p>According to the Shin Zu News Agency, the plan to develop cotton planting on Hainan Island was initially proposed by Rong Zongjing, a giant in the yarn industry, to the National Cotton Production Improvement Association. After the association passed it, it negotiated with the National Economic Council to be responsible for its promotion. The association also believed that the development of cotton planting on Hainan Island was of great importance to the future of China's production. Therefore, the association ordered the Cotton Control Commission to plan and implement it. The Cotton Control Commission immediately decided that the first step was to investigate the actual situation of the area, and then formulate a detailed cultivation plan based on the results of the investigation for implementation. It has now been decided that the National Economic Council, the Agricultural College of Central University, and the United Association of Chinese Yarn Factories will each send personnel to form an inspection team to go to investigate together. In addition to Guo Shun of the United Association of Yarn Factories, who has already set off for Hong Kong the day before, Feng Zefang, director of the Central Cotton Adulteration and Mixing Prohibition Office, representing the National Economic Council, and Yu Qibao, representing the Agricultural College of Central University, are scheduled to travel to Hong Kong on the Empress of Asia on the 11th of this month, and then gather with other representatives in Hong Kong to go to Hainan Island for survey.</p>
<h3>Chinese Employees of Foreign Firms Voluntarily Pay Income Tax</h3>
<p>Wang Huaiding's Patriotic Enthusiasm</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Office began collecting income tax, people from all walks of life have been flocking to the office to inquire. In order to facilitate taxpayers' understanding of tax payment procedures, the office has set up an inquiry office and assigned personnel to be responsible for handling it. In recent days, in addition to the majority of domestic business and industrial circles, many overseas Chinese merchants have also sent personnel to contact everything and inquire about various tax payment situations. Among the overseas Chinese merchants, such as Ahu Man, Davis, Ke Baoluo, and lawyers from the United States, the American Jibei Foreign Firm, the American Yihua Foreign Firm, the British Baohong Insurance Company, the Swedish Liannuo Foreign Firm, the German Yuxing Foreign Firm, and the American Baptist Publishing House, the Chinese staff of the French Dali Accounting Firm Ding Kangzhen and others have voluntarily paid income tax to the office. Wang Huaiding, a Chinese employee who works for overseas Chinese merchants, claimed to be a foreman in a certain foreign firm, with a monthly salary of 25 yuan, and a total of about 130-140 yuan including extra income, and asked the office to indicate the tax payable.</p>
<h3>China-Philippines Air Route to be Realized Soon</h3>
<p>China-Siam Air Route is also Under Negotiation</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a large number of people from Guangdong and Fujian provinces in our country reside in various parts of Southeast Asia and Siam to do business. In the past, they all took foreign ships for round trips, and the annual leakage was huge. Overseas Chinese are eager to serve their country, so people from all over have suggested to the government to open international air routes, which has been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to be handled by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It is heard that a decision has been made, and the newly built Hai Ting ship will sail between Xiamen and the Philippines. The ship is now sailing between Shanghai and Guangdong. After returning to Shanghai for inspection and repair, it will sail to Xiamen for its maiden voyage around the end of this month. There will be one flight per week thereafter, and the journey will take about one day and one night.</p>
<p>China-Siam Air Route is Under Negotiation</p>
<p>There are also many overseas Chinese in Siam who travel back and forth every year, so they have also requested that Chinese ships sail to the area. Xu Ge Ting, an executive committee member of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Siam, returned to China a few days ago. He also contacted the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company about opening the China-Siam air route. Xu has been very busy with social engagements in recent days and has also contacted domestic goods manufacturers to negotiate the sale of domestic products in Siam. Because it has come to an end, he was accompanied by Wang Zhihua to Beijing by the Capital Express this morning. Jiang met with Changzhou and asked for the establishment of the Sino-Siamese Association and the opening of the China-Siam air route as soon as possible. After staying for a while, he will return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Siamese Side Proposes Joint Venture in Shipping Industry</p>
<p>Our country organized and dispatched an inspection group to Siam a few years ago. The inspection in Siam was warmly received by the local overseas Chinese and the local government. There were sincere discussions on the development of commerce between the two countries. It is heard that the Siamese government proposed to jointly establish a China-Siam shipping company at that time. The plan was quite detailed, with a capital of 4 million yuan, half from China and half from Siam. Other details, such as routes and ship tonnage, were carefully planned. At that time, our inspection group agreed very much, but because it needed to be approved by the government, it promised to study and decide in detail after returning to China. However, the Siamese government has paid much attention to this matter, so it has sent Willie Bei, the commercial commissioner in Hong Kong, to contact our authorities through Xiaofocheng Zisongqin. It is heard that the government is considering it and will soon become a reality.</p>
<h3>Martyr Qian Digeng to be Publicly Buried in Wujiang</h3>
<p>Martyr Qian Digeng was involved in the revolution and had significant meritorious service. He died righteously in Shanghai in the 16th year of the Republic of China. After proposals by Li Liejun, Ju Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, and others, and approved by the 35th Central Standing Committee meeting, he was permitted to be publicly buried to comfort his heroic spirit. Martyr Qian was from Wujiang, Jiangsu. His coffin is temporarily placed in Wujiang. According to Jin Luwang, director of the Martyr Public Burial Preparatory Committee, who is in Shanghai from Jiangsu, he is contacting various sectors regarding the public burial. The location will be in Wujiang. Once negotiations are complete, all matters can proceed. Now, a brief biography of the martyr is recorded as follows: Martyr Qian Digeng, named Gang, was from Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province. He was forthright, magnanimous, and had lofty ambitions. He studied at the Jiangxi Standing Army Training Camp and later transferred to the Army Military Police School until graduation. In the winter of the 15th year of the Republic of China, our army confronted the rebel Sun in Jiangxi. The martyr plotted an uprising in Shanghai. Before it could be completed, he was captured by the rebel general Li Baozhang on January 16th and faced death unyieldingly. The martyr had revolutionary aspirations from a young age. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, when Hu Ganchen and Liao Bolang returned from Japan, he was introduced to the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). In October of the Xinhai year, when the banner of righteousness was raised, the martyr responded to the uprising in Jiangxi and went with Li Liejun to Hubei to form the Northern Expeditionary Army. After the Yangtze River was pacified, he reunited with comrades and welcomed Li back to Jiangxi to manage military and civilian affairs. During the Second Revolution, he was in charge of the military law office of the Jiangxi Governor's Office, exerting great effort. After the failure of the campaign against Yuan Shikai, he fled to Japan. In the sixth year of the Republic, he was ordered to welcome members of the extraordinary National Assembly to Guangzhou. In the eleventh year, he served as aide-de-camp of the Grand Marshal's Office and commander of the Zengcheng Garrison. He then returned to his hometown due to illness. In the thirteenth year, he served as a councilor of the Second National Army. In July of the fourteenth year, he went to the Eastern Expeditionary Army Headquarters as the director of intelligence and was transferred to be an adjutant at the Huangpu Military Academy. With the rise of the Northern Expeditionary Army, he went to Shanghai and died righteously. He was forty years old. The day after his death, his wife, Ms. Liu, prepared a coffin and mourned his death. His head was severed, but his face remained lifelike, which was praised by all who heard of it. His elder brother, Shu Fen, and younger brother, He, are both ambitious. His son, Kangmin, is already of age and will surely carry on his father's legacy.</p>

<h3>Smuggling and Drug Trafficking in North China Remain Rampant</h3>
<p>According to a translated report from the Mainland News Agency, Dr. Wu Liande, director of the Customs Epidemic Prevention Department, recently conducted a ten-day inspection in the areas of Tianjin, Tanggu, and Qinhuangdao. After returning to Shanghai, he told people that Korean and Japanese ruffians are still very active in the private trafficking of drugs in North China, which is deeply painful due to the mental and physical harm caused to the ignorant people. Dr. Wu, a world-renowned public health expert, reportedly received reports from relevant parties that the drug traffickers in North China have organized a large-scale smuggling organization. Along the Jinpu Railway line to the north, drug-addicted farmers, shop assistants, and people from middle and upper classes can be seen everywhere. Their bodies are deeply sunken, their shoulders are raised high, and their faces are bloodless. The severity of the drug harm can be imagined. According to reports from customs epidemic prevention sub-bureaus in various places, Korean and Japanese drug traffickers smuggle large quantities of various drugs from Shenyang to Tianjin every day. They enjoy freedom of movement due to special forces. After arriving in Tianjin, they sell the drugs to farmers and shop assistants at low prices. After being disarmed, customs inspectors are often subjected to violent acts by ruffians, making it impossible for them to perform their duties. The smuggling of drugs is now gradually spreading southward from the northern end of the Jinpu Railway line. Various drugs are priced low, and drug traffickers use sweet words and persuasive tactics to promote sales, and quite a few people fall into their trap, especially young and ignorant teenagers. The main factories for manufacturing these drugs are located in Shenyang, Dalian, and Harbin, with Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan serving as distribution and wholesale hubs. Passengers on the Beining Railway can purchase and consume drugs from smugglers at any time in the train, because there are many drug traffickers, and the illegal protection from certain parties makes it impossible for the customs to investigate. In addition to the railway line, drug traffickers also use highways to smuggle drugs from Shenyang to various places in North China. Drug traffickers know that customs officers are powerless, so they have become increasingly rampant. Dr. Wu also stated that the smuggling in North China has not been stopped, and the customs losses have reached 53 million yuan per year.</p>

<h3>Six Japanese Warships Arrived in Shanghai One After Another Today</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Nihon News, the flagship "Izumo" of the Third Fleet, led by Commander Hasegawa, which sailed to Taiwan and South China on January 6th, is scheduled to return to Shanghai today (6th) and dock at the consular wharf for about a week before sailing to North China.

<h3>Meeting of Representatives Called for Airplane Donation to Celebrate Birthday</h3>
<p>Donations Not Yet Fully Collected</p>
<p>The airplane donation campaign in this city to celebrate a birthday, with a target of one million yuan, has not yet reached the goal. The Airplane Donation Association called a meeting of representatives from various organizations and groups at the 9th floor of the YMCA at Baxianqiao at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd to discuss solutions. Attendees included Jiang Hao from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Mao Heyuan from the Ningbo Association, Li Jinghua from the National Military Training Association, Gu Xinyi from the Grain Trade Association, etc. The chairman of the Airplane Donation Association, Li Dachao, reported that the association has collected about 800,000 yuan in airplane donation to celebrate the birthday of Generalissimo Chiang, including 50,000 yuan donated by the Catholic Church. There is still a shortfall of 260,000 yuan from the target amount. Only the donation from various organizations and groups, such as the Grain Trade Association, which has already paid 50,000 yuan, the Ningbo Association, which has already paid 70,000 yuan, the Fresh Meat Industry, which has already paid 50,000 yuan, the Special Industry which has already paid 20,000 yuan, and the Military Training Association, which has already paid more than 24,000 yuan, as well as the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Hotel Industry Association, have fully paid their donations. They are requested to pay the remaining amount to the association before the 25th of this month for consolidation. Donations of 500 yuan or more, regardless of the amount donated or self-donated, will be submitted to the government for awards to encourage further donations. Subsequently, various representatives spoke one after another and decided on several solutions. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

In addition to Dr. Baker and his wife, the Chinese side included President Wang Zhengting, Director of the Shanghai Office Luo Chuanhua, Guo Bingwen, Zhu Youyu, Mei Huaquan, Zhang Nachuan, Lu Meiseng, Liu Kunwan and their wives, and Yang Guangsheng, Wu Liande, and Guo Chengen. The Western side included advisers of the American China Famine Relief Committee, Walin, Xibaibai, Luguike, Mein, Hamilton, Bao Yindeng and their wives, as well as the chief editor of the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, Gao Erte, and the chief editor of the Millard's Review, Bao Hui'er, and Bao Shide, totaling more than thirty people. First, the president of the association, Dr. Wang Zhengting, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the entire association, sincerely praising Mr. Baker's experience and knowledge in famine relief, saying that with Mr. Baker's planning and advice, the association's affairs would develop daily, which can be expected, and would benefit the country's disaster management, and the future would not be insignificant. Subsequently, Mr. Baker stood up to express his thanks, briefly saying that his talent and abilities are insufficient for such an important task. The former director-general, Mr. Zhang Yuanshan, was excellent in both scholarship and experience, and he was deeply worried that it would be difficult to follow him. However, because the undertaking had already been established and had a foundation, it would be easier to follow the rules. In the future, he would devote his efforts to promoting the association's promoted rural construction, cooperative experiments, and training of disaster relief personnel. He hoped that everyone present would provide guidance at any time to correct his shortcomings. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and the guests and hosts were happy, and it ended at 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>News After the Cessation of Operations of the Inland Navigation Steamship Company</h3>
<p>It has been reported that after the Inland Navigation Steamship Company was ordered to cease operations, employees of various shipping routes sent representatives to petition the Party and government authorities in this city. According to the person in charge of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, after the company took over the Inland Navigation Steamship Company, its business was not very developed, resulting in significant losses. Last year, most of the steamships were leased to local shipping merchants operating on various routes, but the results were still not good. After the reorganization of the company, it repeatedly received orders from the Ministry to end the operation of the Inland Navigation Steamship Company, and it was decided to cease operations at the end of the 25th year. At that time, because the various procedures had not been completed, the Ministry approved an extension to cease operations on January 15th of this year. Regarding the agreement with Zhang Yi, the outside world does not understand the truth and there are many misunderstandings. When the Inland Navigation Steamship Company was processing its closure, a merchant named Zhang Yi contacted the Inland Navigation Steamship Company to lease steamships and docks, but it was stopped due to an event, and it was not realized. This is what happened. As for the Ministry of Transportation's decision to close down the Inland Navigation Steamship Company, it was mainly because the company was a business with additional operations. The company had already incurred losses after it took over, and it was inconvenient to maintain it. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should focus on expanding the Yangtze River and ocean business and provide private shipping merchants with opportunities for development on inland navigation routes. In addition, it was heard that the Inland Navigation Steamship Company did sign a draft lease agreement with Zhang Yi for the lease of steamships and docks, but it was stipulated that the draft agreement would be invalid if approval was not granted within half a month after consultation. The statement that "the contract specifies that the entire handover will be handled on January 16th of the 26th year" is not factual.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Four Major Companies Urging the Use of the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent letters to Yong'an, Sincere, New World, and Great World yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, In the instruction No. 2266 from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau on the 4th of this month, it is stated that the Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food, and Bread Trade Association of this city reported that most of its members reported that since the association unified the use of the new counter scales last summer, there have been no inconveniences in calculating transactions with each other. There are some non-member colleagues who are reluctant to change, but once they are guided, they will follow suit. However, the four major department stores standing on Nanjing Road, such as Yong'an, Sincere, New World, and Great World, use yards for measurement and pounds for weight, relying on the special areas of the concessions, and seem to be unaware of government regulations. Members reported that calculations are inconvenient and cause losses. After repeated negotiations, they have been ineffective. According to the investigation, there is a 10% difference between pounds and catties. If you want to trade with them, you must suffer this tasteless exploitation. Because of their large sales volume, you have to reluctantly endure it. This not only violates administrative regulations but also disrupts the market. After a meeting to review the situation, it was decided to report to the responsible officials and strictly ban it to achieve uniform standards and eliminate abnormalities forever. It is requested that your bureau order the immediate change to maintain consistency and facilitate transactions. According to the investigation, the new system of weights and measures has been in effect in this city for many years, and the companies should comply with it. According to the previous report, it is ordered that you transfer the order to the companies to comply with the immediate change to the new system and do not delay. It is very important to report the handling situation. In order to unify the weights and measures, it is concerned with the national regulations, and all merchants should not be unique. Moreover, your company has a large scale, and all its actions are admired by the whole city. In response to the previous orders, we write to urge you to look into the matters set forth in the order, immediately change to the new system of weights and measures, and it is our hope that you will report the handling situation."</p>
<h3>British Tram Workers Demand Improved Treatment</h3>

<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, all 1,300 ticket sellers and drivers of the British Shanghai Electric Tramway Company in the Public Concession, in order to demand that the company authorities improve their treatment, specifically submitted ten conditions and sent representatives Yang Zhaoyu and others to contact the director of the transportation department.

<h3>Robber Shot Dead in Dongxi Huade Road After Struggling with Police</h3>
<p>Female Servant Deftly Stops Robbers, Owner Suffers No Loss Two Robbers Escape, Two Pedestrians Hit by Stray Bullets</p>
<p>Chen Xiaoyu, 46 years old, from Shaoxing, lives at No. 105, No. 573 Lane, Dongxi Huade Road (i.e., Baohua Lane). At about 8 o'clock yesterday morning, while Chen was still sound asleep, three men suddenly approached Chen's house and knocked on the back door, each holding a bag of peanuts and persimmons, appearing as if they were delivering gifts. At that time, Chen's female servant, Chen Fang, was washing in the kitchen. She suddenly heard a knock on the door and immediately opened it to investigate. Unexpectedly, the three men</p>
<p>Pulled Out Pistols</p>
<p>Warned her not to make a sound, and stepped into the house. Chen Fang, realizing that she had encountered robbers, was not flustered at all. Catching the robbers off guard, she immediately slapped the pistol held by the leading robber in his hand onto the ground, knocking it off and onto the stone steps. She then took the opportunity to push the robber out of the door and ran to the front door, shouting "Catch the robbers!" The robbers, seeing that things were not going well, hurriedly picked up their pistols and fled backwards. At that time, two plainclothes detectives, No. 611 and No. 731, from the Huishan Police Station, were</p>
<p>In a Small Teahouse</p>
<p>Near the Xinji Bang Road, sipping tea. Hearing the alarm, they rushed over. Thus, both sides opened fire, and bullets rained down like a storm, with sounds like continuous pearls. The robbers fled while firing, and the detectives chased closely. By the time they reached the intersection of Dongyouheng Road and Yuanfang Road, the police officer at post No. 2995 also joined the chase. One of the robbers was shot more than a dozen times and fell in front of the Lester Institute of Engineering, and threw his pistol into the wall of the school. The other two robbers escaped in the chaos. The detectives then</p>
<p>Checked the Fallen Robber</p>
<p>Beside him, but he had been dead for a long time. They found a wallet in his pocket, containing 5 yuan in legal tender, and two business cards. The detectives immediately telegraphed the police station and sent a vehicle to transport the robber's body to the mortuary for examination. In addition, it was found that during the fierce battle between the detectives and the robbers, two pedestrians were injured by stray bullets near Yuanfang Road. One was Zhao Wenhua, 24 years old, from Ningbo, who lived at No. 90 Deyu Lane, Dongyouheng Road, and worked as a small worker in an iron factory.</p>
<p>Bullet Hit the Lower Abdomen</p>
<p>The other was Yu Ajin, 36 years old, from Ningbo, who lived in Zhabei and worked as a vendor. His leg bone was hit by a bullet. Both were hired vehicles to be sent to the hospital for treatment, but Zhao Wenhua's situation was more serious and very critical. The Huishan Police Station summoned the female servant Chen Fang to the police station after the incident to commend her. They deeply praised her brave actions and will praise and reward her.</p>
<p>Westerner Acts Bravely</p>
<p>According to the Municipal Council, at 9:00 AM yesterday, Mr. Foyin, Assistant Inspector of the Donation Tax Section of the Finance Department of the Municipal Council, was passing through Xihua Road on official business when he suddenly encountered a robber with a pistol running towards him. Two plainclothes Chinese police officers blew their whistles and chased him from behind. Mr. Foyin hid behind a lamppost and drew his pistol (the Municipal Council collectors carried pistols to protect themselves or assist police officers in the event of an accident). He took the opportunity to fire a shot and hit the thug. The thug staggered and fled, and fired back. Mr. Foyin and the Chinese police bravely chased him. Another Chinese policeman also rushed to the scene and fired three more shots, finally killing the thug. The thug had colluded with four other robbers to rob a store on Xinji Bang Road, so he fled. Mr. Foyin bravely opened fire and was alert and quick, which is highly commendable.</p>
<h3>Renewed Hearing Yesterday for the Case of the Assassination of Tang Youqian</h3>
<p>The judge painstakingly sought details, repeatedly questioning the defendants.</p>
<p>Former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tang Youyu, a native of Xiang, was assassinated on the evening of December 25, 1935, in front of his private residence, Gan Village, on Rue Ganston in the French Concession. After the Shanghai authorities offered a reward for the capture of the culprit, the former Public Security Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government apprehended Liu Zhennan, a native of Hubei, at 26 Rue Robert in the Siamese Concession. The Public Security Bureau also apprehended Qiu Jiyu, a bandit, and learned that he was also a principal culprit in the murder of Tang. The French police then transferred Liu and Qiu to the Special Second Court for interrogation and investigation. After a long period, the investigation was completed. The lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Police filed a public prosecution against them for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Former Criminal Division Chief Wang Gangxu and Judge Chen Daqi repeatedly held court hearings, but the case remained unresolved. The two defendants had confessed to firing the shots that killed Tang. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Gong Kun, the Criminal Division Chief of the Special Second Court, presided over a renewed hearing in the First Tribunal. The lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Police, Fei Xizhen, presented the case and the articles of indictment. The court then ordered the two defendants to be interrogated separately. First, Liu Zhennan was questioned, but he suddenly recanted his confession, denying involvement in the murder. Qiu also recanted his confession. The prosecuting officer then reported that Tang Weishu, the sister of the deceased Tang Youren, had intended to testify in court today, but was unable to obtain leave from her position as a clerk in the Special First Court. Only the female servant, Zheng Li, testified. Li testified that she only heard several gunshots and then came down from the fourth floor, only to see that her employer had fallen near the second floor. She did not see the person who fired the shots and knew nothing else. Presiding Judge Liao painstakingly sought details, repeatedly questioning the two defendants for a long time. He then decided to reschedule the hearing after further investigation. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Quarrel Over Meager Dowry During a Visit to Relatives Leads to a Fight</h3>
<p>The parties even resort to litigation.</p>
<p>Chen Genfa, a 19-year-old native of Ningbo who works as a compradore, residing at 24 Caojiazhai, Connaught Road, in the British Concession, married Gui Juan, the daughter of Wang Pan, a fellow countrywoman working as a domestic servant in the residence of the Italian Vice Consul, Ma Weili, at 1 Lane 1, 2001 Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession, through a matchmaker on September 24, 1935. After the wedding, they became estranged due to dissatisfaction with the bride's dowry, leading to frequent disputes. On the night of the 27th of last month, Chen Baolin and his daughter-in-law, Wang Gui Juan, quarreled again. Chen then confined his daughter-in-law in her room, forbidding her to leave. The next day, Gui Juan wrote a letter and threw it out of the window, asking a passerby to deliver it to her mother, Wang Pan, informing her of her confinement. On the night of the 29th, Wang Pan took her daughter, Gui Juan, back to her home. On the night of the 30th, at around 9:00 PM, Chen Baolin, along with his wife and son, Chen Genfa, went to Wang Pan's room, Room 1, 2002 Avenue Joffre, to demand that Gui Juan return home. This led to another argument between the young couple, the in-laws, and the parents, which escalated into a physical fight. Bystanders were unable to stop them. Pan's employer, the Italian Vice Consul, called the French police on duty, who sent detectives to the scene. Chen and his family had already fled home. Afterwards, Wang Pan inspected her room and found that fifty yuan in banknotes were missing. Feeling aggrieved that she and her daughter had been injured, she reported the incident to the French police, accusing her in-laws, Chen Baolin and Chen Genfa, of assault and theft. Yesterday, Chen Baolin was apprehended and sent to the Special Second Court, requesting a rescheduling of the investigation. Judge Qiu presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court.</p>
<p>After the police lawyer presented the case, Wang Gui Juan testified that since her marriage, her parents-in-law and husband had been unhappy with her dowry, leading to discord. However, her father-in-law had treated her well, but unexpectedly attempted indecent behavior. On the night of the 27th of last month, her father-in-law came to her room and tried to misbehave. She refused and scolded him, and he then beat her and locked her in the room. She now had injuries to her head and face, and requested an investigation. When Chen Baolin was questioned, he denied the assault. He said that the young couple had quarreled. The court reviewed the testimonies and decided to reschedule the hearing to the 11th. The defendant was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Death from Pufferfish Poisoning</h3>
<p>An elderly couple dies, a young son sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>A Jiangbei boat was moored in the Lujiabang area of the South City, carrying an elderly couple and their young son, whose names were not known. It was only known that their son was named Fan Ronghua, 13 years old, from Huaiyang. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Ronghua found two pufferfish on the shore nearby. He then took them back to the boat and cooked them with his parents. Shortly after, they were poisoned and suffered severe abdominal pain. The sound of their groaning alerted neighboring boats, who went to investigate and found the three of them rolling around in the cabin. After questioning, it was discovered that they had eaten pufferfish and been poisoned. The incident was immediately reported to the nearby police station, who summoned ambulances from the West District Fire Brigade to the scene. However, the elderly couple had already succumbed to the poisoning and died. Their son, Ronghua, was taken to Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Child Shouts "Thief," Shot and Wounded by the Thief</h3>
<p>Yang Gensheng's life is in danger.</p>
<p>At around 6:00 PM yesterday, three bandits suddenly arrived at Yang Longxing Lacquer Shop at 11 Lujiadu, Pudong. Two bandits stood guard outside the door, while one bandit rushed into the shop, pulled out a pistol, and demanded money from the shop owner, Mr. Yang. Yang's son, named Gensheng, 12 years old, was nearby and shouted, "Catch the thief!" The bandit became enraged and told him to be quiet, but Gensheng did not listen. The bandit then fired a shot at him, hitting Gensheng in the left hip. The bullet exited through his right back. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The bandits, seeing that they had caused trouble, did not rob anything and fled. Afterwards, the shop owner reported the incident to the local police station and sent his son, Gensheng, to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that he was severely injured and his life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Female Singer Accuses Jiang Boying of Obscenity</h3>
<p>Jiang fails to appear, hearing postponed.</p>
<p>Jiang Boying, the Shanghai-native manager of the Continental Trading Company at 851 Peking Road, has recently been accused of obscenity in the Special First Court by Lai Ling (also known as Shu Ming), a famous female singer from Fuzhou. The case stems from the fact that Lai joined the Star Technical Song and Dance Troupe organized by Jiang several years ago and went abroad to perform. On the way back to China, Jiang raped her, leading to the lawsuit. The Special First Court had previously summoned him for questioning, as reported by this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefen held a continued hearing in the First Criminal Court. The defendant, Jiang Boying, did not appear. His wife, Fan Qiongyu,委托委托吴正矱，凤昔醉律师到庭, stating that Jiang had gone to the capital on the 25th of last month and had been entrusted by the Capital World Theater on the 4th of this month to invite performers from Peiping, so he could not appear in court. She requested that a longer period be granted for him to appear in court. The court then questioned Lai Ling about the organization of the Star Technical Song and Dance Troupe. The hearing was then adjourned until the 19th. It is reported that Lai Ling will also be going to Wuhan tomorrow with a certain song and dance troupe to perform.</p>
<h3>Wu Baoqian Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Joint Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>Sun Shaokun, a Chinese detective at the Customs Police Station, learned that a Korean man named Xiao Jin was selling heroin for profit at 45, Lane 70, Huaji Road, and was living quite well. He reported this to the police chief, and together with a Western detective and a Japanese consulate detective, obtained a search warrant from the First Special District Court. They secretly went to the address at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday to arrest Xiao Jin, who had already fled after hearing the news. They arrested Wu Baoqian, a Shandong native, who was an accomplice, along with 116 packs of heroin, a one-dime note, sixty one-fen copper coins, and 136 ten-wen copper coins. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution under Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Drug Crimes, requesting a strict investigation. Sun, the detective, then reported the process of solving the case and presented the evidence. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he was not working with the Korean man. He said that a friend surnamed Liu had asked him to buy a small pack of heroin on his behalf, and he had been mistakenly arrested. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Judge Zhong Qing ruled that the evidence was sufficient and that there was no room for cunning excuses. He sentenced Wu Baoqian to life imprisonment for jointly selling drugs, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The evidence was confiscated according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Pi Sha'er Stabs Huang Kongshi Eighteen Times</h3>
<p>The assailant asked about his missing wife; a knife wound to the forehead is quite severe.</p>
<p>Huang Jinwen, 28 years old, a native of Henan, lived in a thatched hut in the Old Camp of Gaochang Temple in South Shanghai. His wife, Huang Kongshi, was from the same hometown and of the same age. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 PM the night before last, a friend named Pi Sha'er from their hometown came to visit. When Huang Kongshi saw that her husband had a friend visiting, she took a teapot and went out to get tea at the tiger stove. Unexpectedly, Pi followed her to the tiger stove and said to Kongshi, "My wife has been missing for eight months. Do you know anything about it?" Kongshi replied that she did not know his wife and had no idea where she had gone. Pi then, without asking any further questions, pulled out a sharp knife and stabbed Kongshi eighteen times: one stab to the forehead, one to the right cheek, one behind the left ear, one to the right rib, one to the back, one to the right shoulder, five to the left arm, one to the left thumb, and one to the little finger. She was covered in blood and fell to the ground in agony. A police officer arrived on the scene, but the assailant had already fled. The injured woman was taken to Bethel Hospital for treatment. According to Dr. Mei, the knife wound to the forehead was quite severe and her life was in danger. The police station, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched detective He Wenjin to investigate the cause and arrest the assailant for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Owners and Pullers Hold Separate Meetings to Protest Reduction in Rickshaws</h3>
<p>After the Public Works Department of the Public Concession decided to reduce the number of rickshaws through a lottery on February 20th, rickshaw owners and pullers held separate meetings to protest. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Meeting</p>
<p>After the Public Works Department decided to reduce the number of public rickshaws in the concession, it was resolved that 484 rickshaws would be reduced through a lottery on the 20th, leaving 9,500 rickshaws. The owners had repeatedly opposed this decision through their association, but to no avail. The Special District Rickshaw Association held a joint meeting of representatives from the five districts at 4:00 PM yesterday, attended by over a hundred people, including Yin Zhiling, Hou Shaoan, Yuan Songmao, Wang Kunyi, Zheng Jianquan, and Bao Zhenhuang. Yin Zhiling chaired the meeting. As a result of the discussion, they unanimously opposed the Public Works Department's move and made a false resolution to seek assistance from all parties. This false resolution will be submitted to the general meeting of rickshaw owners for discussion. At the same time, the association notified all rickshaw owners to attend the general meeting of rickshaw owners at the City Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 AM on the 9th of this month to discuss countermeasures. According to the person in charge of the association, who spoke to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, in the past year, the Public Works Department had ordered wage cuts and forced them to pay a license fee of 1.5 yuan in January of this year. Now, they want to reduce the number of rickshaws. These rickshaws are licensed in three areas, and the Public Works Bureau and the Public Concession Bureau are following suit. Is this not forcing the rickshaw industry into bankruptcy? Therefore, the industry believes that the Public Works Department's move is not justified. At the same time, for the sake of livelihood, they are determined to oppose it to the death.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Meeting</p>
<p>On the rickshaw pullers' side, a general meeting of representatives from the five districts was held yesterday morning, attended by fifty people. Chen Guoliang was elected chairman. The chairman first reported that if the Public Works Department reduced the number of rickshaws, it would inevitably lead to an increase of 1,734 unemployed rickshaw pullers. Including family members, the number would be over 6,604, cutting off their livelihoods, which is contrary to the principle of rescuing rickshaw pullers. After discussion, it was resolved that: (1) they would protest according to law, requesting the Public Works Department to withdraw its order; (2) if the goal was not achieved, they would take effective measures to cope with it. Then, they discussed the Public Works Department's arbitrary punishment cases and resolved to oppose the requirement of carrying a raincoat on sunny days. In addition, due to the severe weather, business was slack, and most rickshaw pullers had nothing to protect themselves from the cold, even freezing to death, starving to death, or committing suicide. However, the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association was monopolized, collecting a huge sum of 15,000 yuan per month, totaling 480,000 yuan, with no adequate relief for the poor rickshaw pullers. It was resolved to ask the chairman to follow the previous year's method and, together with legal counsel Wu Kaisheng, find ways to solicit donations of cotton clothes and white rice to distribute to the poor rickshaw pullers to help them get through the Lunar New Year. According to Chen Guoliang, a representative of the rickshaw pullers, since the Public Works Department registered rickshaw pullers, more than 40,000 rickshaw pullers have become unemployed. Now, they want to reduce the number of rickshaws by 484, and thousands of rickshaw pullers will become unemployed because they have no rickshaws to pull. Moreover, the Public Works Department not only does not restrict electric trams, buses, private rickshaws, and taxis in the concession, but is increasing their number day by day. If the Public Works Department wants to think about the public, it should expand the number of rickshaws to maintain the livelihoods of unemployed rickshaw pullers and facilitate the travel of people in the lower classes. Otherwise, it should reduce them equally. Furthermore, according to the new regulations of the bureau, public rickshaws must carry a raincoat on sunny days, otherwise they will be arbitrarily detained and punished. In recent years, theft incidents have occurred repeatedly. Once stolen, would this not increase the burden of compensation for poor rickshaw pullers? In short, the Public Works Department's move is completely unreasonable and disregards the overall situation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Public Works Department invited reporters to discuss the postponement of the lottery method for reducing rickshaws. According to reports, the board of directors of the Public Works Department had previously resolved to reduce the number of public rickshaws by 500 from March 1 of this year. The bureau had announced this in September of last year and handed it over to the bureau's Rickshaw Special Committee to consider the implementation methods of this resolution. The committee had sent a letter to the Rickshaw Industry Association, asking them to express their opinions on the most fair method they believed was available for reference. The association replied that it was unwilling to express its opinions unless the Public Works Department fully explained the reasons and intentions for reducing the number of rickshaws. The Rickshaw Special Committee of the Public Works Department believed that the board of directors of the Public Works Department could handle the matter at its own discretion and submitted three suggestions to the board of directors. The board of directors resolved at a meeting on February 3 to hold a lottery on February 13. Yesterday, the Rickshaw Industry Association sent representatives to the Public Works Department to request a postponement of the lottery, citing the imminent Lunar New Year. Therefore, the board of directors of the Public Works Department approved the postponement to February 20. During this postponement period, the Rickshaw Industry Association may still express its opinions for reference.</p>

<h3>Kuai Shitai Sues for Inheritance</h3>
<p>Shi Feng's mother is an English woman, suing in court as an agent.</p>
<p>Kuai Shitai, a native of Hefei, Anhui, residing at No. 12, Lane 314, Hardoon Road, Shanghai, is involved in a lawsuit with his family in the First Special District Court over an inheritance dispute. Kuai Shitai's grandmother, nee Li, had three sons: Xiaoxian, Shouhian, and Xiuxian, and one daughter, Shuping, who was the principal of Peicheng Girls' School. Xiuxian married a Scottish woman named Huibo in England and had a son, Shitai, in 1919. He is now seventeen years old. Xiuxian died in 1923, followed by his two elder brothers. His second elder brother, Shouhian, had no children and his widow, Xu, is now alone. His eldest brother, Xiaoxian, left four children: Shiyuan, Shifen, Shisun, and daughter. After the death of Kuai Li on September 2nd of last year, she left two parts of the estate: (1) Real estate and movable property worth about 130,000 national currency; (2) A estate worth about 50,000 yuan. Shitai's widow Huibo believed her son was one of the people entitled to inherit the inheritance above. Because her son was underage, she hired Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, and other lawyers as legal representatives and brought a suit against Kuai Shuping, Kuai Xu, and Shiyuan, Shijing, Shifen, and Shisun in the First Special Court to divide the estate. The lawsuit stated that apart from Shouhian, who had no descendants, Shuping was unmarried and should be equally divided with the three-part analysis by the Xiaoxian and Xiuxian. The plaintiff is the son of Xiuxian and should inherit one part. The 50,000 yuan part, apart from Shuping who had no right to inherit, should be equally divided by the Xiaoxian, Shouhian, and Xiuxian, and the plaintiff should also inherit one part. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Gongyu opened the trial, and each defendant hired Wu Baotai and Xu Jiaji as lawyers to represent them in court. They expressed objections to the plaintiff's division of the three parts. They also said that Kuai Li had a total of four sons and one daughter, but one of them, Nianxian, died before marrying, so there were not only three sons and one daughter, so the estate should be analysed as four parts. Then, the plaintiff's mother, Huibo, testified in court. She was 39 years old. Although she had joined Chinese citizenship earlier, she still did not speak Chinese, but testified in English, which was translated by a translator. Under questioning by Judge Xu, it was argued that the retreat be postponed for review.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Orders Rickshaw Association to Approve Collection of Membership Fees</h3>
<p>The Special District Rickshaw Association, because the Public Works Bureau handled the self-donation license of the car owners, the membership fee was not in place, and requested relief from the Municipal Government. Yesterday, the Municipal Government approved the collection as usual, and the association has notified all members. It is hereby announced that the business rickshaw in the city has been implementing the insurance donation system. Members pay membership fees when they go to the association to stamp the seal every month. It has been a year since this system has been in place. Since the beginning of this year, the insurance donation system has been cancelled. All members paid membership fees, and the method has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval in Approval No. 4357. The competent authority has designated a bank to collect the fees on behalf of the government. When donating the license every month, the taxation offices in the South and North of the city must verify that the membership fees have been paid before the license can be obtained. This month is due to the sudden timing and there is not enough time to contact the bank to collect the fees. Except for the bank to collect the fees after the announcement, all membership fees for this month and last month will still be collected by this office. Please donate the license to the car owners, and send the membership fees for each car to the weaving office at one corner per month, and receive the receipt member card so that it can be presented when donating the license. In addition to publishing in the newspaper, this is specially announced</p>

<h3>The Municipal Party Department sent a letter to the Municipal Government to ban the increase of copper coins</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department sent a letter to the Municipal Government yesterday, saying: "Dear Sir, since the government implemented the legal tender on November 4, 1935, the market price of copper coins in this city was set at 300 copper coins per legal tender yuan. The market was stable and the people were convenient. However, due to the proximity of the Lunar New Year, a general group of merchants seized the opportunity to manipulate and deliberately raise the copper coin debt, with each yuan only exchanging for about 280 copper coins. This not only violates the law, but also affects finance and endangers the livelihood of the poor. It is proposed that your government take swift and effective measures to maintain the market. We hereby send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government and hope that you will review and handle it accordingly."</p>
<h3>Hui Kang Steamer Not Yet Salvaged</h3>
<p>Another Attempt to Tow Today</p>
<p>The Hui Kang steamer of the Huitong Shipping Company, which ran aground on a stone embankment on the morning of the 4th while entering the port from Ningbo, was inspected yesterday morning by surveyors from the insurance company. The results showed that the bottom of the bow hold, six feet above the waterline, was stuck on the embankment. As a result, the Northern Shipping Company's tugboat did not dare to tow it at the time, fearing that the embankment would tear the bottom of the ship. The current salvage plan is to pump water into the aft hold, hoping to raise the front part of the ship's hull, and then tow it out during high tide. If this fails, another attempt will have to wait until the large spring tide next week. Therefore, the ship salvage operation yesterday failed to dislodge the vessel, and the final decision was to load the aft hold of the Hui Kang with enough coal to raise the bow, while simultaneously filling the bottom of the bow hold with a large number of sandbags, so that the hull can withstand less friction damage from the embankment stones. It is said that all work is now complete, and salvage efforts will resume today.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Tobacco Exchange Holds Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting Central Bank to Issue More Copper Coins</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Office of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association held an emergency meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at its office in the Great South Gate, because the Central Bank entrusted the Tobacco Exchange Association to exchange one-cent new copper coins, but the office can only receive three boxes per day, totaling 600 yuan. All of the more than 1,000 businesses in the southern district can only receive a little over one yuan each, which is far from enough. In particular, with the old year-end approaching, the need is even greater. More than a dozen committee members attended the meeting, including Kang Chuxin, Qian Wenda, Qiu Tanglin, Chai Zhisheng, Chen Kunxian, Chen Zhenxiang, Qian Xuanqing, Chen Enqi, Li Jingxing, and Wang Bingzhong. Qiu Tanglin, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting, and then discussed the following relief measures for exchanging one-cent copper coins: ㊀ The association requested the Central Bank to allocate two boxes of one-cent copper coins, totaling 600 yuan, to the office each day. The more than 1,000 members in the southern city were allocated this money, but it was insufficient. If this continues, it will be difficult to stabilize debt exchange. The meeting resolved to ask the association chairman, Chen Kunxian, to contact the Central Bank again to request an increase in issuance. ㊁ The Central Bank is closed on Sundays. The association should request the bank to increase the amount issued on Saturdays to facilitate distribution. The meeting resolved to send a letter to the association requesting the Central Bank's approval. ㊂ It was discovered that the market was exchanging one national currency yuan for only 98 fen of one-cent copper coins, which was clearly a profiteering opportunity for unscrupulous merchants and damaged the reputation of the industry. The meeting resolved to request the association to unify the exchange price among the industry to ensure uniformity. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM.</p>

<h3>Travel Industry Association Writes Letter to French Police Requesting Investigation of Anonymous Accusations</h3>
<p>The Travel Industry Association of this city recently wrote a letter to the French Police requesting an investigation and cessation of anonymous accusations against hotels in the French Concession. The original letter is extracted below: "Respectfully, according to reports from major hotels in the French Concession, there have recently been frequent anonymous accusations to the French Police Department and the French Municipal Council regarding violations. The authorities do not investigate and immediately dispatch detectives to search, often catching wind and grasping shadows, and the result is nothing. Travelers have already suffered unexpected panic and are unbearable to harassment. This situation may be due to malicious extortion or jealousy among competitors. The authorities must investigate and severely punish this kind of anonymous accusation, otherwise this trend will be detrimental to business and harass travelers. At this time of business decline, how can we withstand this blow? We all bear heavy burdens. The authorities do not provide protection, but lightly believe in a piece of anonymous accusation and immediately conduct unwarranted searches, disturbing travelers. We should forward a letter to the French Police Department to raise a serious protest and investigate and severely punish this matter at any time to prevent bad customs and stabilize business." After checking the association's records, the claims are indeed true. Anonymous accusations are not permitted by law. The matter should be reported to your department. In the future, if there are any such anonymous accusations, they must be investigated and severely punished to prevent bad customs and stabilize business. Sincerely, the Shanghai Travel Industry Association, February 5th, to the French Police Department.</p>

<p>Large Investors Spare No Effort to Boost Prices</p>
<p>B, D, and E Bonds Rise Strongly</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the upcoming Spring Festival holiday, the market for government bonds on the Chinese Securities Exchange was strongly boosted by large investors, and the rising trend resumed, boosting investor confidence. Retail investors who were short were forced to cover their positions, and the market price slowly rose, showing considerable strength. Starting today, the Spring Festival holiday has begun, and trading will resume as usual on the 15th. At the opening yesterday morning, the market sentiment was quite buoyant, and purchases of 32.4 bonds were very strong. Sales of 46 bonds were still significant, and market prices rose across the board by 1 to 4.5 corners. In the secondary trading session, sales of 43.5 bonds were very active, and 50 bonds continued to be heavily purchased. Retail investors also covered their short positions and swapped positions, and Unified E bonds rose by 5 fen to 2 corners. B bonds for this month, however, were down by a small corner. At the opening in the afternoon, the upward trend was even stronger, with 50 bonds still being purchased. Retail investors covering their positions became even more crowded, and market prices rose another 5 fen to 3 corners. The closing trading desk still showed strong buying interest. Purchases of 50.10 bonds were still strong, and 35.12 bonds were slightly released. E and D bonds rose again by 5 fen to 2 corners. As a result of the full day, all bonds rose uniformly by 3 to 5 corners to 7 corners. A bonds rose by only 1 to 2 corners, and long-term financial bonds fell back by 5 corners. The total transaction volume was 8.2 million yuan. The comparison of price increases and decreases is listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Rumors Spread of Continued Orders for Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>Standard Wheat Falls About One Dime</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market opened in the morning showing signs of continued decline for all months. The prices for foreign wheat were slightly lower in the American and Canadian markets, while Australian wheat rose two pence. Therefore, the market was initially stable. However, by closing, the flour market had already fallen, and rumors spread that factories in Tianjin and Qingdao had placed orders for a ship of foreign wheat, further depressing confidence. Prices fell two to eight fen compared to the opening. In the afternoon session, because the exchange would be closed for nine days, many clients holding long positions, wary of continued orders for foreign wheat, aggressively sold off. The market gradually declined three to five fen. According to market insiders, the wheat harvest in 1936 was abundant, and inventory in producing regions was higher than in previous years. As the season for new wheat in China gradually approaches, old stocks must be continuously sold off. A major shift in market sentiment is feared because of this.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Liquidation of Long Positions</p>
<p>Futures Flour Also Becomes Unstable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially appeared stable but then experienced a sharp decline for all months. Prices for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada fell by varying amounts, while Liverpool rose by two pence. Therefore, the market sentiment was initially stable, with little difference from the previous day's close. However, due to settlement, yesterday was the last day of trading, and both internal and external transactions were awaiting completion. As a result, the situation was superficially calm but inherently fragile. Subsequently, the market gradually declined. Rumors spread that factories in Tianjin and Qingdao had placed further orders for a ship of foreign wheat, totaling seven or eight thousand tons, at a price of nine yuan and ten fen. Consequently, clients holding long positions aggressively liquidated their positions, and the market became unstable. By the afternoon session, the news of continued foreign wheat orders had spread throughout the market, and outside long positions seemed unable to resist further selling pressure, resulting in a sharper decline. Prices for both near and distant months fell by a significant six to eight fen. Given this situation, the market after settlement, may see a sluggish market, and a sharp decline should be guarded against.</p>
<p>River Rice Arrivals and Sales Both Scarce</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of goods from various regions showed no arrivals from the Jiangsu-Tong region. Only a dozen boats arrived with Bo rice and early rice, totaling approximately three to four thousand five hundred shi. Sales were slow due to the approaching end of the trading period. Retailers were only replenishing stocks slightly, and bulk buyers only took a little over a thousand packages of Bo rice from the Qingdao region. Therefore, the market situation remained unchanged, showing a steady state. Prices for both thick and thin Japonica rice remained unchanged, and no specific varieties had significant sales. From today, the South Shanghai rice market will close, awaiting reopening after the New Year.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, ten boats arrived from various river ports. The distribution of goods in the market was weaker than before, as rice shops were well-stocked and settlement of accounts approached. Prices for high-quality white Japonica rice weakened by a few fen to nearly a dime, while the lower-quality rice remained stable. Early rice was scarce, and prices held firm. Bo rice was weak, and white Yuan rice showed some loosening. Prices for various Indica and other rice varieties showed a weakening trend. After the close, some merchants considered suspending transactions.</p>
<p>Guest Indica Rice Prepared for New Year Display</p>
<p>Yesterday, Guest Indica rice continued to arrive from various ports, but all was prepared for display after the New Year. Traders had also stopped trading. Except for shipping existing stock, there was no new trade enquiries from the Guest region. Therefore, yesterday, the total market only sold a few hundred packages of milled brown rice in the morning, distributed between Xiamen and this street. The market situation was similar to the previous day. The Guest Indica rice market thus concludes here.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Warehouse Yarn Inventory Increases</p>
<p>Yarn Alone Drops More Than One Yuan This Month</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm and trending moderately, as yesterday was the last day, and major long and short position holders lacked competitive drive, having to decide the outcome next spring. However, someone from Changfeng released 7,300 bales, and the third-grade yarn market was unbalanced, so the trading floor appeared slightly looser. As for spot yarn, customer sales remained narrow, and confidence weakened further. However, gold traders, securities traders, and Indian merchants all held long positions in the February futures, so future changes are truly alarming. The yarn inventory in warehouses has gradually increased, reaching more than 16,000 bales.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Disgorgement by Changfeng</p>
<p>The futures yarn market opened with mixed results, with prices varying up or down by two or three jiao, as today was the last day of business, and the market was extremely quiet. Major long and short position holders remained inactive, and all transactions were for small amounts to settle trades. Market prices lacked excitement. The results for standard yarn in May showed mixed gains and losses compared to the previous day's close, varying up or down by one, two, or three jiao. In the afternoon session, the market softened due to large-scale disgorgement by Changfeng Yichang, coupled with weak yarn sales. The third-grade yarn market gradually declined, and market prices were affected. As a result, the current month fell by nine jiao compared to the morning close, February fell by two jiao, and the rest remained unchanged. Sold: Mei Ji 1,600 bales, Yichang 1,700 bales, Changfeng 7,500 bales, Gengfeng 1,400 bales, Shen Ji 1,250 bales, Hengchang 800 bales, Dayong 600 bales, Fukang 1,100 bales, Chang Ji 500 bales.

The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Prices Remain Flat</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain quiet. Statistics show that all merchants bought a total of 390 bales throughout the day, and the selling price was similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts by each merchant are listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn Factories on Holiday Break</p>
<p>Cotton Market Lacks Excitement</p>
<p>The cotton market is ordinary, and there are no significant gains or losses, as the overseas cotton market remains in a state of consolidation, and confidence is weakening. However, the supply from various sources is declining, and factory demand is weak due to the approaching end of the lunar year, with yarn factories taking a few days off.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Down Slightly</p>
<p>The futures cotton market opened with prices down slightly, due to the sluggishness of American cotton and the rise of Indian cotton. However, the supply from various sources felt notably lacking, and floating traders actively covered their positions, causing the market to turn upward. However, trading within the market was very sparse. The results for standard cotton in all months showed gains and losses of five fen compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon session, the market situation was very flat and tired, fluctuating up and down by five fen, and trading was very light. The results for all months showed a decline of five fen to one jiao compared to the morning close. Sold: Tongfu 1,000 dan, Yukang 1,200 dan, Zhenda 1,600 dan, Taichang 2,800 dan, Yichang 2,700 dan, Tonghe 5,100 dan, Senkang 1,700 dan, Xiecheng 1,000 dan, Xinchang 1,200 dan, Fuyuan 2,300 dan. Bought: Jifeng 1,300 dan, Fukang 6,200 dan, Yongchang 1,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,000 dan, Hexing 1,100 dan, Wang Taixing 1,800 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed to the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption Weak</p>
<p>Spot cotton factory demand is weak. The sources are 800 packages of Yao cotton and 169 packages of general cotton.</p>
<p>Pledged American Cotton Was Sold Off Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened firm due to good news from Liverpool. Overnight, traders and some foreign merchants bought, and the market rose firmly. Prices for all months rose by two to seven points. Afterwards, cotton with mortgages was sold off in the market for the first time, causing uneasiness. This led to the liquidation of long positions, especially the May futures on Wall Street. Fortunately, traders bought on dips, and the decline was slightly curtailed. Finally, short position holders covered, and prices firmed again. Export demand is expected to improve. Currently, some cotton cannot be shipped out due to the Pacific Coast sailors' strike. At the same time, Germany and Italy may also be buyers. The close was firm, with spot prices down five points and futures prices unchanged to down five points. English cotton spot prices rose eight points, and futures prices rose four or five points. Indian cotton initially fell due to hedging and selling by short position holders, but rebounded later due to buying by speculators and favorable news from Liverpool. Calcutta rose 0.75 to 1 rupee, Oomra rose 0.75 to 1 rupee, and Broach rose 1 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th dispatch).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 5th: Broach at 227.5 rupees, Oomra at 210 rupees, down 0.75 rupees, and Calcutta at 182 rupees, down 0.5 rupees.</p>
<p>Osaka Yarn and Cotton Decline Unabated</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 5th: Spot yarn fell 2 to 5 yen. 16-count fan face 248 yen, down 2 yen. 20-count goldfish 265 yen, down 3 yen. 40-count five-star 415 yen, down 5 yen. 42-count pheasant 400 yen, down 3 yen.

The near month was 74.70 yen, and the far month was 77.20 yen.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Local Merchants Suspend Business to Inventory</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Trading Nearing Completion</p>
<p>The cloth market is flat, and transactions are gradually becoming sparse. Except for occasional transactions by distant merchants and speculators, most local merchants have stopped stocking goods, are taking stock, and preparing for the New Year. Generally, only tomorrow remains for trading, and business will resume on February 15th. Yesterday, the market was stable. Eastern fine cloth occasionally retreated slightly (2.5 fen per piece). Fine twill from local factories also fell 5 fen. Spring cloth, both high and low grades, remained firm. Yarn, whipcord, colored cloth, and coarse cloth selling prices were unchanged.</p>
<p>Woolen Sales Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The woolen market can be said to have completely stopped in recent days. Merchants are only busy collecting accounts and are not paying much attention to transactions. This is a common phenomenon before the year-end closing. The samples put out by the Qiu Huo brokers have also been collected. However, in previous years at this time, merchants and non-merchants often took the opportunity to buy up mortgaged goods, old stock, or closing-down stock. However, this year, because most of the old goods have been sold, this type of transaction is nowhere to be found.</p>

<h3>Special Item: Banks and Foreign</h3>
<p>Draft Rules for Foreign Exchange Business (Continued)</p>
<p>Or, for other reasons, failure to fulfill delivery, or in the event of a customer suspending exchange, going bankrupt, or declaring bankruptcy, and liquidation, etc., all transactions due or not due may be immediately closed at market prices. If there are losses, the customer is responsible for settlement, but the bank has no obligation to close the position on behalf of the customer. (Ren) The method of delivery for customers buying and selling domestic and foreign gold and silver from the bank should be handled in accordance with the rules of the relevant exchange or local customs. Otherwise, the bank may handle it in accordance with the aforementioned Xin clause. (6) Settlement Silver (Jia) The settlement silver payable by the customer to the bank must be submitted to the bank on the first business day of the month in which it is due (the difference in buying and selling). Those who offset the position with other banks, even if the settlement silver has been paid in full, the customer is still not considered to have fulfilled their responsibility and must wait until the bank has settled the position before the responsibility can be lifted. (Yi) The settlement silver payable by the bank to the customer, if the transaction has been settled in the month in which it is due, should also be paid on the first business day. If there are outstanding positions, it may be paid after all positions have been settled.</p>
<p>Article 7: Foreign exchange brokers (hereinafter referred to as brokers) guaranteeing foreign exchange transactions should be handled in accordance with the following clauses. (1) Brokers guaranteeing foreign exchange transactions should be jointly and severally liable with the insured party, and may not be released until the delivery is clear and the settlement silver is paid in full. Unless otherwise agreed, they may not claim the defense of Article 745 of the Civil Code (Note 1). (2) When delivering, the bank has the right to accept or reject the customer's position slips, but the guaranteeing broker may not use the high or low price in the position slips as an excuse to evade their responsibility. (3) When the foreign exchange transactions made by the customer and the bank are due, if the number of purchases and sales is sufficient to offset each other, regardless of whether it is guaranteed by the broker, the bank may give priority to offsetting without prior agreement. If the customer cannot pay the settlement silver, the guaranteeing broker should be responsible for paying the principal and interest. If several brokers have handled the offsetting transactions at the same time, the losses should be borne by each broker in proportion to the components of the transactions they have made. For the purpose of calculating the ratio of losses to be borne by each broker, the bank may close both sides of the purchase and sale at the closing market price of the day and recover the losses from each broker according to the amount. After the settlement, if one party of the transaction has a surplus, the bank may temporarily retain the surplus until all problems are solved. (4) If the foreign exchange sold by the customer to the bank is offset against the position slips of other banks, the settlement silver payable to the bank, if the customer cannot pay, and several brokers have handled it at the same time, the bank may average the prices of the position slips submitted by the customer and offset them separately against the settlement price of each purchase originally made by the bank. The losses should be recovered by the bank from each injured broker in proportion to the components of the transactions they have made. (5) If the customer suspends exchange, goes bankrupt, declares bankruptcy liquidation, or fails to fulfill the obligation of an order for any reason, the foreign exchange transactions made with the bank, whether or not they are due, should be handled by the guaranteeing broker by providing a position slip from another bank agreed by the bank, or by another bank guaranteeing delivery, or by closing the transaction at market prices, unless the bank agrees in writing. If the broker does not handle it in accordance with the above, the bank may close it at the closing market price of the day, but the bank has no obligation to close it on behalf of the broker. The losses should be fully borne and compensated immediately by the guaranteeing broker. (Note 1) Article 745 of the Civil Code: Before the creditor forcibly executes the property of the principal debtor and it is ineffective, the guarantor may refuse to pay the creditor.

<p>Introduction to Major National Financial Events in 1936</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Hengmin's "Major National Financial Events in 1936" is divided into two parts, currency and banking, and is described with rich and concise materials, which is very convenient for inspection. I think that not only the financial sector should be like this, but also the industrial and commercial sectors should not lack the need for similar works. Perhaps Mr. Pan has pioneered this path, and I hope that similar works will be created in the future, providing us with major events classified by categories for inspection, which can save a lot of effort. Wouldn't that be great? This book is sold by Liming Bookstore and other distributors on Sima Road, priced at 4 jiao.</p>

<h3>Embarking on the Road to War</h3>
<p>— Hu Dui</p>
<p>A Word to Women in Their Boudoirs</p>
<p>The crisis of 1936 that the world's prophets told us about fortunately did not erupt, but the oncoming 1937 is still not very optimistic. The author is certainly not a world prophet, but Western Europe and East Asia are filled with combustible flames: Hitler and Mussolini have never changed their resolutions, and the civil war in Spain can only be prolonged and expanded. In addition, if the Eastern country, which calls itself the England of the East, still conducts its so-called military diplomacy, then the German-Japanese agreement or the Japanese-Italian communication, these things will inevitably form mutual relations due to the mutual interests of each other. So, looking at the world as a whole, our future is not optimistic. Even stepping back and looking at the space and position occupied by our country and nation, it will also make our hair stand on end!</p>
<p>Since the four northeastern provinces were occupied, the Jizhong-Sui provinces incident followed, and then there were rumors of the independence of the five northern provinces. Fortunately, people whose conscience has not died are unwilling to be other people's puppets, but people always think that we can be deceived, using all their energy to destroy our security. Therefore, our current position is in a state of extreme danger, and the space occupied by the nation-state has been exploited bit by bit. Therefore, from now on, all of us, men, women, old and young, must shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and saving ourselves, especially young women. For the warmth of the boudoir, now is not the time to talk about it.</p>
<p>We don't need to talk about any more theories. Just open our ears and eyes to hear and see. Here are teams of women going to the front lines to participate in combat or comfort soldiers, and there are teams of women participating in drills, rescue, or shooting. The time spent applying powder and rouge has been changed to making clothes and uniforms to comfort the soldiers. Beauty is natural beauty, health is natural health, without artificial decoration and affectation. As long as you can endure hardship and undertake any construction on the battlefield, that is a healthy woman.</p>
<p>The bugle and war drums are urging us forward, "Da Duo, Da Duo, step on the battle line, step on the battle line." This is the era forcing us to move forward. Embarking on the road to war is not a fashionable requirement, but a mobilization that everyone in China and the world should participate in. We are not fighting for ambition and desire, we are only fighting for national liberation and national independence.</p>
<h3>Will Women Participate in Future Wars?</h3>
<p>— Translated from the British Evening News</p>
<p>In the recent Spanish Civil War, women fought alongside men with great courage. Is this a precedent for future wars? If countries go to war in the future, should women be allowed or forced to go to the front lines? This has now become a question. A university professor, an army officer, and several other figures whose views are worthy of respect solemnly predict that in the next war, women will definitely be conscripted, and even British women will not be exempt. This conscription is not like in the last European war, where women only served in auxiliary corps. Instead, they will be soldiers directly confronting the enemy. I felt a chill upon hearing this opinion, but after careful consideration and assessing all the circumstances, I dare not say that it is impossible. The first thing that can be decided is that if Britain is attacked by a strong power or a coalition of strong powers, then it must resist with the strength of all men and women in the country in order to remain undefeated. After the outbreak of war, it goes without saying that all men and women of military age will be conscripted to perform the military service deemed appropriate by the government. In the final emergency, physically strong women may be ordered to operate guns and cannons. In future wars, the two armies will be far apart. Machine guns and rifles can hit enemy defenses beyond the line of sight, and cannons can fire over several miles. The newest and most lethal weapon, the bomber, can bomb concentrated troops and naval vessels with deadly poison gas bombs from the sky. These new weapons can be used by both men and women and do not rely on strong physical strength. The lightness of the machine gun is especially suitable for women's lithe bodies. As for cannons, as long as you know arithmetic and can calculate range and direction, women can use them as skillfully as men. In addition, British female pilots have shown that they can take risks and endure hardships as well as men, so aerial warfare presents no difficulty for women. It is absurd to say that the hundreds of successful female pilots in Britain today would not be able to operate fighter planes in a future war. In view of the above points, the past arguments that women are physically inferior to men and cannot wield weapons to defend their territory are now nonsense. Whether women should participate in the war is now merely a moral question, or perhaps an emotional one. However, in my personal opinion, no civilized government, no matter how militaristic, has ever dreamed of using force in this matter. The crux of the matter is whether women are willing to participate in the war. If they are willing, will men approve? In my lifetime, the nature and status of British women have changed dramatically. They share civil rights with men, have the same voting rights, can hold various occupations, and compete with men for a living in many industries. Men, for their part, are very willing for women to be on an equal footing with them, acknowledging their fundamental rights as citizens. But there is one thing they will definitely refuse: they will resolutely oppose turning women into killers. If Britain is attacked by a strong enemy, men will be as brave as before, standing up to kill and repel the enemy. They will loudly protest against training women to use guns, cannons, and bombs. In our Britain, women are greatly respected, and it would be an unspeakable degradation to plunge them into bloody and cruel affairs.</p>
<h3>Matters to Note During the Winter Vacation</h3>
<p>— Dan Xing</p>
<p>It is currently the winter vacation, and female students have already left school and returned to their hometowns. But how should they spend this month-long vacation? Some female students think that the summer vacation is for "escaping the heat" and the winter vacation is for "escaping the cold." They should temporarily put aside all their studies and order their servants all day to stoke the stove, sit around the fire for warmth, and eat and lie down, truly enjoying the blessings of a vacation. Or they might look at plum blossoms or ice skate. At worst, they might play cards with their families. Recreation and entertainment are also a kind of spiritual and physical rest, which is unavoidable during the holidays. I do not oppose it in any way, but I believe it is a great "luxury" to spend the entire vacation completely on "playing," "eating," and "sleeping." Why not use this vacation time to do some work?</p>
<p>Some female students may say: We are still studying. What work can we do? Household chores are done by servants, and financial distribution is done by our parents. Indeed, a comfortable living environment can foster a petty-bourgeois identity that does not know what work is. However, can the current comfortable environment permanently sustain your enjoyment of blessings, and can you permanently hide in school without going out into society? I can answer for you with certainty: Absolutely not. Neither the current nor the future society will give people the right to enjoy comfort. Men have to rely on work to earn a living. How can women be an exception? Perhaps, even today, there are still women who hold the mistaken idea that as long as they can marry a wealthy and capable husband, they can live a life of ease. This is forgivable in uneducated and unknowledgeable women. However, it is deeply regrettable if knowledgeable women still think this way.</p>
<p>Those many wanderers lost in confusion are waiting for insightful and knowledgeable individuals to dispel their illusions and rescue them from dire straits. How can we allow ourselves to repeat their mistakes? Only those who earn their own living can achieve true liberation, and only those who earn their own living can establish an independent personality. Therefore, we must cultivate the ability to make a living as early as possible. What we get in school is only limited textbook education. Current facts tell us that just possessing book knowledge is still dangerous for our livelihoods. The "taking risks" of college students and the suicide of a couple who were a book editor and an obstetrician, respectively, forced by life are "ironclad proof." Recently, the government has been focusing on vocational education and establishing more vocational schools for this very reason. We should be vigilant during our studies.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that female students will not only enjoy the blessings of a warm stove during the winter vacation. They may as well practice household service and community service. If one person's ability is not enough, they can gather more classmates or fellow villagers to do it together. Whether it's at a weaving machine or in the fields, work has no distinction between high and low and has no boundaries. Even just the short month-long winter vacation is an excellent opportunity to train your ability to endure hardship and lay a solid foundation for self-reliance and making a living.</p>
<h3>How to Cook Food</h3>
<p>— Jie Fen</p>
<p>—Common Sense a Smart Housewife Should Have—</p>
<p>The most difficult task for a housewife every day is how to prepare some good food. Here are some methods for cooking common foods, which is also common sense a smart housewife should have:</p>
<p>Cooking Pork:</p>
<p>Pork is most difficult to tenderize. You can add a little hawthorn, which will quickly tenderize it while preserving its flavor. Another method: You can add baking soda, but it is not as good as hawthorn.</p>
<p>Cooking Ham: The skin of ham is extremely difficult to tenderize. If you coat it with white sugar before putting it in water, it will tenderize in an instant, and the flavor will be rich and delicious.</p>
<p>Cooking Salted Meat: If salted meat has a foul smell, add more than ten walnuts with holes drilled in their shells to the pot while cooking. This will reduce the foul smell.</p>
<p>Cooking White Tripe: After boiling pig tripe, cut it into long pieces, place them in a bowl, then add a little broth and steam it on top of a rice cooker. This will double its thickness. However, do not use salt, otherwise it will become hard and shrink.</p>
<p>Cooking Mutton: Use a whole radish, drill small holes all over it, and put it in the broth with the mutton to cook for forty minutes. Then remove the radish, and then braise it in red sauce or white sauce. This will eliminate the fishy and gamey taste.</p>
<p>Cooking Old Duck: When putting the duck in the pot, add a few snails and cook them together. This will make it tender and cooked quickly.</p>
<p>Cooking Sea Cucumber: To make it expand quickly, you can throw in small pieces of broken porcelain, which will make it expand very quickly.</p>
<p>Cooking Vegetables: When cooking vegetables, above-ground stems should be cooked in boiling water; underground stems should be cooked in cold water. However, sweet potatoes are an exception.</p>
<p>Cooking Kelp: Kelp is tough. Even after cooking it for a long time, it is difficult to soften, which is a waste of time and firewood, which is regrettable. If you add a little vinegar while cooking, it will be easy to soften and become palatable.</p>
<p>Cooking Black Dates: You can cook them with pith of grass, and the skin will come off by itself.</p>
<p>Cooking Fresh Fish: Wait until the pot is hot, then do not add oil first. Instead, rub the pot almost entirely with a piece of ginger, then add oil and cook the fish. No matter what, the fish skin will not stick to the bottom of the pot and cause the fish meat to fall apart.</p>
<p>Cooking Potatoes: After putting potatoes in the pot, if their color seems to be turning black, you can add a few drops of vinegar to the water they are being cooked in. This will make them white, soft, and palatable.</p>
<p>Cooking Eggs: When cooking eggs, wet them with cold water first, then put them in boiling water. This will prevent them from cracking.</p>
<p>Cooking Bamboo Shoots: Boiling fresh bamboo shoots in boiling water will make them cooked easily, crisp, and delicious. Or add a little mint and sprinkle a few grains of salt, and they will not be astringent.</p>
<h3>Interview Notes at the Women's Education Center</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhang</p>
<p>Educational opportunities should be equal. Regardless of whether they are men or women, as long as they are human beings with round toes and square heads, then everyone has the right to enjoy education, and everyone should be able to read and write. However, despite the theoretical statement, in reality, due to the feudal idea of valuing men over women that has prevailed in China for thousands of years, it is firmly entrenched in the minds of the general public. It is generally believed that men should be able to read and write and enjoy education, while women? Under the slogan "Lack of talent in a woman is a virtue," they are deprived of the opportunity to enjoy education. What a cruel and unreasonable thing that is!</p>
<p>In recent decades, the call for women to enjoy education has gradually attracted social attention. As a result, in addition to the rise of girls' schools, institutions and organizations dedicated to women's education have continued to be established. (The Shanghai Women's Education Center is one of the organizations dedicated to women's education. Here, the author reports to the readers on the center's recent situation and scope of work.)</p>
<p>On a cold winter morning, in order to understand the actual situation of women's education centers, I hired a streetcar and went straight to Hualong Road. Upon reaching the gate of the center, I explained my purpose to the gatekeeper, and a service staff member named Wang Qing began to guide me to the reception room.</p>
<p>Our conversation began at this time. According to this staff member, the Women's Education Center has been established for four or five years. The director is Mr. Zhou Baoshao. Mr. Zhou's purpose in establishing the Women's Education Center was because he saw that many housewives had not received adequate education, which led them to stick to old ways in handling household affairs and lacked good plans. This has a close relationship with social order and the future of the nation. In order to enable housewives to generally acquire some common sense of managing a home, skills in handling household affairs, and knowledge of childcare and hygiene, he decided to establish this Shanghai Women's Education Center as a starting point for implementing women's education. After its establishment, thanks to the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life, the development of the center's affairs has been quite rapid. The center holds a weekly meeting to discuss the direction of the center's work and also runs a women's remedial school, enrolling older housewives who have dropped out of school to attend remedial classes at the center. They charge very low tuition fees, hoping that older women in the vicinity who have dropped out of school will have the opportunity to receive remedial education at the center. They organize a Housewives' Association, which holds monthly meetings to discuss family problems and invite female leaders to give speeches at the meetings. They also organize a Mothers' Association, which also holds monthly meetings to discuss childcare methods and parenting issues. In addition, they organize women's vocational training classes, teaching craft skills. For example, the weaving class, which ended last December, was able to arouse the interest of women in general. In addition to these, we also publish a Women's Monthly, which publishes issues on women's issues and extracts news from the women's world, and the subscription target is entirely women."</p>
<p>As for the center's funding, this staff member said, "It is entirely borne by Director Zhou. If the amount is not enough, he solicits donations from the outside world. At present, there are no problems with income and expenditure. However, in order to run more businesses related to women's education, we hope that the government will provide considerable subsidies to support the development of women's education. This is something that we hope to achieve in the shortest possible time."</p>
<p>The clock pointed to eleven o'clock. Unwilling to take up the staff member's valuable time, I shook hands with him and said goodbye. On the way back, I silently wished the center a long and successful future, creating a great new life for women's education in China.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk About Child Brides</h3>
<p>— Xia Fei</p>
<p>Child brides are a product of the old etiquette and the old marriage system, a kind of blind marriage based on matchmakers' words and parents' orders. However, its legacy has not yet been completely eliminated, and the tragedy of child brides continues to be played out in the old families of those remote villages. If we are willing to go to these places to investigate, I believe we will find many so-called child brides, especially those who have come from child bride backgrounds.</p>
<p>In fact, the life of a child bride is no different from that of a maidservant, except that the title and status are different. However, we only hear calls for the abolition of prostitution and maidservants, but not calls for the abolition of the child bride system! In fact, if we want to seek women's liberation and thoroughly reform the marriage system, we must first eliminate the widespread child bride system that kills the happiness of men and women.</p>
<p>Although the knowledge of the general villagers is a little more enlightened than before, and they seem to be less stubborn about their children's marriages than in the past, they still absolutely disagree with laissez-faireism, and fatalism and matchmakers' words are still flourishing unabated. Especially the child bride system, which has become more widespread than in the past. Although the parties concerned have changed the name to "tong jiao xifu" (child foot wife) in order to avoid the title of "yang xifu" (adopted wife), in fact, isn't it still one and the same? It's just a clever name change.</p>
<p>As for the origin of child brides, although I don't know which dynasty it started in, the reasons are generally either betrothal in the womb, or because the two families are close friends, or because they want to save money and are poor. In the past, these reasons were considered very legitimate or unavoidable.</p>
<p>As for a girl, whether she is in swaddling clothes or in her teens, once she becomes someone else's child bride, all her fate and life will be controlled by her future parents-in-law, and her freedom will be deprived from then on. It is not until she and her fiancé formally announce their marriage that her days can get a little better. If her fiancé is a person of bad behavior, she may be threatened and ravaged by him, so the matter of "eating cold rice" and "sitting in the corner" often happens in families with child brides. If she unfortunately dies herself, there is naturally nothing to say. If the fiancé dies, then she is mostly a widow guarding the grave. Until she has lived out the three years of filial piety and guarded the filial piety, she prepares to be determined to guard the punishment and win the beautiful name of a chaste woman (?). In addition, if she wants to walk out - to marry - then in addition to seeking the consent of the parents-in-law, she must also pay a considerable bride price to the parents-in-law. On the contrary, the parents-in-law can casually marry her off to someone else, or recruit a "yellow mud shoulder son-in-law" to the house to replace their son's duties; she, of course, still has to honor them with the etiquette of a daughter-in-law serving her parents-in-law.</p>
<p>There are also two types that are considered upright and very common in the countryside: ㊀ is to "chongxi" (ward off bad luck); - when the fiancé is sick in bed and is about to give up hope of medicine, the family members use the superstitious custom to have the child bride marry a patient with no hope of living, send him to the bridal chamber, and eventually hasten his death due to overwork, so that the innocent girl becomes an unjustifiably a widow, "small then ends her precious youth, and the great one sacrifices her lifelong happiness: this kind of superstitious custom that is useless should be overthrown as soon as possible. ㊁ Whenever a child bride's fiancé dies, if her fate is not bad, then she will be matched with the fiancé's younger brother, which is called "one uncle takes his sister-in-law."</p>
<p>According to what I have heard and seen, there are countless tragic stories about child brides, and the experiences of all child brides are mostly very bad. Therefore, I deeply feel that child brides are indeed a serious problem in the women's movement!</p>
<h3>Fourth Letter</h3>
<p>— (Zhuo Dai)</p>
<p>Ms. B:</p>
<p>I was just about to talk to someone about the most important issue in our country's families. Now that you are discussing with me how gardens and our lives are related, what kind of great mission do they have? That day, I can take this opportunity to talk to you about it. Women are the masters of the family, so this issue should be discussed with women even more.</p>
<p>Family, family, everyone shouts it, everyone says it. May I ask: We call it a family, have we ever reflected on ourselves? Do some of us feel ashamed? Although we Chinese have a home, where is the "ting" (courtyard)? How many people have a "ting" in their homes? Can we call it a family if we have a home but no "ting"? This is a very serious problem for us Chinese. A Shanghai-style house, a crab-eye patio like a chimney, can this be called a "ting"? A home with a vacant lot, where washing clothes, rinsing rice, and dumping garbage are done, can this be called a "ting"? In reality, Chinese families are just homes and nothing more; they don't have a "ting."</p>
<p>What is a "ting"? How can it be called a "ting"? A "ting" is the garden that I am discussing with you. It doesn't necessarily have to be a so-called garden of dozens of acres to be called a garden. As long as it matches the house, there is such a vacant lot, and we think about it from an aesthetic point of view and a practical point of view, and we don't necessarily need a lot of money to arrange it into an elegant garden. This is very necessary for our lives.</p>
<p>We either don't have a family at all, but if we have the name of a family, we can't make it a incomplete family. We must attach a "ting" to the outside of the house. This is not a luxurious lifestyle, it is very necessary for our bodies and minds. Men, after working hard all day outside, can't be locked up in a house like being sued in court when they go back at night. In the "ting," in the flower-lit moonlight, playing with their wives, this is the joy of family. When resting on Sundays, there is no need to take a train out to travel, you can just rest at home. When friends come, they can also pass the time in the "ting."</p>
<p>For women, the "ting" is even more important than for men. Men go out more often, while women are at home all day. If they don't use the "ting" to regulate their spirit and body, they will sit at home with their heads down, and there will be no change at all, which is really a painful thing. As for children, running and jumping, it is even more indispensable to have such a "ting." The two words "family" were originally connected and parallel. Recently, I don't know how they have become distorted, so we must restore them.</p>
<p>Building a garden, everyone thinks, is a very expensive thing, but it is not really so. If the house is small, the area of the garden is naturally also small, so the cost is limited. Moreover, the materials for the garden are nothing more than trees and stones. Of course, there are expensive ones and there are also many cheap ones, and expensive materials may not necessarily make a good garden. Whether the garden is good or not! It all depends on the art of the person who arranged it. This is like painting. Using the same few pigments, some can become famous paintings, and some can only be window decorations. Therefore, if there is really an art of gardening, then it may be that a garden built with two or three hundred yuan can defeat a garden built with one or two thousand yuan. Ms.! I hope that you will come out to restore the word "family," and not have a name without substance.</p>
<h3>Hopes for Female Writers</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Recently, several writers in Shanghai held a "Literary Symposium" at the Youth Association. Almost all the famous writers were present, but it is a strange thing that not a single female writer could be found at such a grand event. Because this symposium was not just to gather their fellow friends to have tea and chat, but also had a greater purpose, which was to unite the entire Chinese literary world on one front to carry out a unified national salvation cultural movement. Therefore, this symposium was far from being a common social gathering. National salvation is everyone's responsibility, and female writers are no exception. Since you can write articles and run publications, you can be considered a member of the literary world. Why should a united front in the literary world leave out a part of its comrades? So I suspect that perhaps none of the Chinese female writers are in Shanghai, or that none of the Chinese women who can write articles and run newspapers are qualified to enter the realm of literature! However, under the word "unification" in the literary world, it is inevitable to feel regrettable!</p>
<p>Therefore, it makes me feel even more that female literary authors have been too silent in recent years! In addition to a few seniors who were once very popular seven or eight years ago, there are not many rising stars. Although there are several women's publications in Shanghai, there are not many mass reading materials that can be taken out and are popular all over the country. There are very few works like Ms. Bing Xin's "Letters to Young Readers" that she used to write. No wonder the literary world has forgotten female writers!</p>
<p>I neither understand literature nor dare to express my opinions rashly. Now I am using the qualification of a young student to hope that the talented female writers, or rather the female compatriots who can write articles, will make great efforts in the literary movement and produce more literary works that save the country and save the people. If the female writers can also hold a female literary symposium to organize some kind of association to work together and research together to produce a large number of national salvation literature, then that would certainly be what I sincerely pray for.</p>
<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: I have just read your publication's issue number 48, containing a Tokyo dispatch titled "A Huge Disturbance That Shocked Students Studying in Japan," and I was extremely astonished after reading it. The article ostensibly concerns the "women's liberation issue" but is actually a vent for personal resentment. I am writing to present the essentials of the matter based on the facts:</p>
<p>(1) Jin Did Not Go Insane: The passage stating, "According to a friend close to Wei Jin, he feigned mental illness to shirk responsibility," is entirely fabricated. Although Jin's wife, Ms. Zeng Yi, became pregnant in 1934 and was admitted to Juntendo Hospital in Tokyo for a threatened miscarriage, he experienced digestive, nasal, and sleep disorders for two years due to the stress of comforting his wife, but he did not go insane.</p>
<p>(2) Jin Did Not Distribute Leaflets: Although Ms. Fei wishes to attribute baseless accusations to Jin by claiming he is insane, it is just as absurd as her accusing Jin of murdering Zeng Yi and oppressing women at the Office of the Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan, because her only evidence accusing Jin of murder is her own "dream." As for the numerous reasons that can prove Jin did not distribute leaflets, the most prominent are: (1) Jin did not go insane. (2) Jin does not engage in such absurd activities. (3) Jin has not seen the so-called leaflets to this day. (4) The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department sent someone to advise Jin that he could sue them legally, but Jin declined with gratitude. (5) Jin has no economic relationship with Ms. Fei, so there is no question of "swindling money"; moreover, they are not close friends, and he does not know Ms. Fei's character in detail.</p>
<p>(3) The Relationship Between Jin and Ms. Zeng Yi: Jin and Ms. Zeng Yi not only have five or six years of marital life but also have three children together, although it was a love marriage, they obtained the consent of both sets of parents. They had a simple wedding reception and received gifts from relatives and friends. Regarding the monetary gifts from both parents, although Ms. Fei brought her to the Office of the Supervisor and filed for divorce on December 23, 1935, Jin has not agreed because her reason for falsely accusing Jin of murder based on a "dream" is untenable. In short, Jin and Ms. Zeng Yi are not only not divorced but also have a long-standing marital relationship, a happy family, and the burden of raising children. Even today, Jin cannot help but love his children's mother, Zeng Yi.</p>
<p>The above is written entirely based on facts, without any falsehoods. I hope that the editor will maintain an impartial attitude and publish it in the newspaper, which will not only protect existing families with children but also prevent young men and women from going astray on the wrong path of "trifling with life." Respectfully, I wish you good health and request your guidance! Wei Jin, January 25th</p>
<h3>After Marriage</h3>
<p>— (Huan Yue)</p>
<p>In order to lighten his burden a little, I finally re-entered society in the second month after our marriage!</p>
<p>Luckily, after only two months of probation, my salary has increased from forty yuan to sixty yuan!</p>
<p>Indeed, in this day and age, the gray city of Shanghai is filled with economic depression. Most small businesses have either closed down or are being liquidated. The larger companies that still exist are busy laying off employees and reducing salaries, let alone considering raises. Indeed, I feel very satisfied with this!</p>
<p>Just a small clerk—a typist at a customs brokerage—able to earn two yuan a day without much effort. That's not easy, is it! I often comfort myself this way!</p>
<p>Indeed, I believe nothing is truer than the saying "contentment brings happiness." I think that the place where he works is too far away from me. Unless there is a special event, we will never see each other during the day because we both have our lunches catered by nearby restaurants!</p>
<p>We are both a bit childish and like to walk together. Every evening, I stroll from Jiangxi Road into Nanjing Road, and he comes over from Jing'an Temple Road. Whether one of us is early or late, or whether it's raining or snowing, we wait at the Shanghai First Department Store tram stop!</p>
<p>Sometimes, after dinner, we go to a nearby second-run theater to watch a domestic film, and maybe even listen to storytelling. This is how we spend our days!</p>
<p>He loves to hold small children. Sometimes we bicker about this, and he tidies his clothes and slips outside. I refuse to give in and go into the side room to play cards. After he returns, we laugh and joke again!</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Abolishing the Long Gown and Mandarin Jacket</h3>
<p>— Tian Yu</p>
<p>Speaking of the long gown and mandarin jacket, this was the most imposing and legally recognized "formal attire" in our country for the past seven or eight years. Not long ago, General Song Zheyuan specially noted on his invitations to entertain guests: Attendees must wear "blue gown and black mandarin jacket." Furthermore, at important state ceremonies, when the president receives foreign envoys, those who shuffle and stumble are all in blue gowns and black mandarin jackets. Group weddings held in Shanghai also stipulated that the groom's formal attire should be a blue gown and black mandarin jacket. Now, Singaporean overseas merchant Chen Jiageng has telegraphed the National Government, requesting that the formal attire of the long gown and mandarin jacket be abolished. He stated that "the long gown and mandarin jacket are remnants of the Qing dynasty's clothing system, no longer appropriate for the times, and should have been abolished long ago. Continuing to adhere to them as formal attire negatively influences the national psyche and hinders national revival," and so on. Following the same telegram, there is the following annotation: "The clothing system regulations promulgated in 1929 are currently under revision, and the Ministry of Interior has drafted a proposal that is under review." It is possible that the long gown and mandarin jacket, previously designated as one of the eight formal attire options, may be abolished altogether.</p>
<p>The minor matter of clothing may seem unrelated to national welfare and people's livelihoods. However, ever since our ancient ancestors proclaimed, "If one's attire is not proper, disaster will befall the person," the matter of clothing has become very important and complicated. Before the Republic of China, clothing systems throughout the dynasties had distinctions in rank. It goes without saying that there was a great divide between officials and commoners. Even the blue-robed scholars, the so-called literati, had specific scholars' turbans and robes that commoners could not wear casually. One can learn about this by reading *The Scholars*. After the Republic of China, these distinctions naturally no longer existed. However, some people still implicitly acknowledge that clothing is related to some grand principles. The long gown and mandarin jacket embody the principle of preserving Eastern spiritual civilization. The clothing system initially established in the early years of the Republic of China was the Western swallowtail formal dress, clearly derived from foreign forms. The long gown and mandarin jacket are unique to China, and it is most appropriate to say that they preserve Eastern traditional virtues. However, according to Chen Jiageng's telegram, this attire is a remnant of the Manchu Qing dynasty. From a national perspective, it is also a kind of foreign attire. Only because it has been used for a long time has the foreign thing become something inherent. I remember an essay by Mr. Lu Xun about "beards." It is said that the upturned two-cornered beard that is currently popular in Japan was originally a Han Chinese beard style that was transmitted there, while the flat, downward beard that Chinese people now keep is precisely the beard style of the northern barbarian tribes. However, after a long period of transmission, some people mistakenly believe that the Japanese beard style is Japanese and that we should not learn it, while the flat beard is unique to China and is considered to be inherited from our ancestors! This is the same situation as people not realizing that the long gown and mandarin jacket were originally clothing of the Qing dynasty. If Mr. Chen had not pointed it out, we would have forgotten.</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese traditional spirit has been greatly emphasized in various aspects. Architecture is one example, with painted beams and carved pillars flourishing for a time. However, the content is entirely based on foreign methods, which is also a kind of contradiction. Insisting on preserving all inherent things today, while the spirit may be admirable, often gives a sense of being strenuous and unrewarding. Rather than this, it is better to let history take its course. Discussing clothing led me to these reflections.</p>
<h3>The Lighthouse Keeper</h3>
<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>Since I was little, my excessively compassionate heart has been moved to trembling by many trivial things.</p>
<p>When I was fourteen years old, my father had to move from Bandung—the place where I grew up—to Cibugis, a quiet seaside town in Cilacap, due to business failures.</p>
<p>There: there were no schools. There was only a long, winding stretch of white sand beach shimmering in the sunlight, the vast blue sea constantly crashing against the shore with white waves, and two stone dikes extending far into the sea, embracing like crab claws—from the shore, one could still see a short tower at the end of each dike, each emitting light throughout the night. In addition, there was what else? A clear blue and lovely sky, perhaps. That watched over the fishermen as they went out to sea in the faint dawn, and watched over them as they rocked back in their small boats in the afterglow of dusk.</p>
<p>I felt lonely.</p>
<p>Every day, I would wander along the beach, picking up shells, digging into the sand to catch small crabs, or go to the woods to find a shady, grassy place to lie down—however, you would always sigh. How can people escape the life of grouping together?</p>
<p>One day, the luminous stone dike that stretched far into the embrace of the sea suddenly aroused my infinite curiosity. I tried walking along the dike—to the front of the lighthouse on the left. The Malay old man who looked after the tower was surprised and befriended me. Afterwards, every morning I would walk along the dike surrounded by the sea and spend the day with the old man; when the sea gently stirred up the wind, and the seagulls and eagles began to circle low above the waves, the old man would send me out of the tower gate.</p>
<p>The old man was lonely. The sea breeze had hunched him over, and the waves made him unable to hear sounds lower than the waves. However, his eyes were sharp, seeing as far as the sea, seeing as clearly as an eagle.</p>
<p>The old man liked to tell stories. He had spent most of his life listening closely to the sound of the waves, and had come up with many stories.</p>
<p>"...Ah, he is a very loving and kind old man! You will not find him in the world, because the devil has made everyone bad—but he will emerge from the sea..."</p>
<p>The old man liked to start like this. He often brought his head almost to my face, and that's how I listened to him speak and tell his stories.</p>
<p>"But won't he drown?"</p>
<p>"No," the old man laughed, his eyes deeply buried in wrinkles. "How can he drown? The white waves that rise and fall are the old man's breath...! When there are too many evil people, the old man will come out, catch the evil people in a big bag, and take them to the depths of the sea..."</p>
<p>The old man made me fantasize. The old man's stories wove a beautiful and lovely picture in my imagination. When I was lonely, I would melt into my illusions, as if I saw the kind and just old man, the fairy of the sea, and the beautiful and tranquil world.</p>
<p>Later, my father had to move the family to the capital, Batavia. When the old man put his ear to my mouth and heard this news, he shook his head, and gently</p>
<h3>Breaking Free from the Clutches of Death</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>In pictures, we can see Death painted, wearing black clothes, wearing a black hat, with eyes that are just two black holes, a mouthful of sharp teeth, and a pair of hands with sharp claws, causing people to die!—The reasons for people's deaths are different, but most are due to illness; so it can also be said that Death uses "illness" as the only tool for killing. However, if people receive appropriate treatment when they are sick, even if they are very ill, they can break free from the clutches of Death.</p>
<p>Appropriate treatment is nothing more than good doctors and good medicine. The Wuzhou Pharmacy has doctors for this purpose and specializes in producing more than three hundred kinds of effective household medicines. It also has consulting rooms for famous doctors of various departments in the building on Fourth Road. The main consultants are the most famous doctors in Shanghai. In this way, those with minor illnesses only need to take over-the-counter medicines, and those with more serious illnesses can seek medical treatment, so there is no way that misfortune cannot be turned into good fortune.</p>
<h3>New Year's Eve Dinner</h3>
<p>— Xin Yun</p>
<p>In a living room, there is a table full of food, with dishes of various kinds, and the old and young are sitting around the table, laughing and talking lively: The stove is burning with a raging fire, forgetting the cold; this is the scene of the Li family eating New Year's Eve dinner.</p>
<p>Mrs. Li is already nearly fifty years old, and she is in particularly good spirits today. She ate many dishes and even ate two bowls of rice. She also looked after the children and earnestly urged others to eat, and her spirit was not tired at all.</p>
<p>I remember that last year, Mrs. Li was suffering from anemia, her face was pale, her hands and feet were often cold, and she didn't feel any taste in her food! And she was mentally exhausted! Since she took "Zilai Blood," her complexion has gradually become rosy, her appetite has gradually increased, and all her symptoms have suddenly disappeared, so she can have the joy of eating New Year's Eve dinner today.</p>

<p>said, looking out at the sea from the window:</p>
<p>"I am a lonely person again!"</p>
<p>From Cibugis to Batavia, and for the six years that followed—until now, from Java to Sumatra, to Borneo, and even back to my homeland in the Pearl River or the Yangtze River basin, the threads of my journey have stretched further and further. However, whenever I see the sea, or when a big wind sweeps up at night, I often think of the lighthouse keeper of Cibugis, and his desolate days surrounded by the waves.</p>
<p>"Bless him! The lonely old man!"</p>
<p>I often pray silently.</p>
<h3>New Year in My Hometown</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>In the New Year in my hometown, the most interesting thing for children is the "lion dance."</p>
<p>Each lion dance troupe has about thirty to forty people at most, and more than twenty people at least. Everyone wears the same clothes and ties a belt around their waist, and they are all brave and upright. As soon as the opening cannon of New Year's Day sounds, they start to perform the lion dance at people's homes. The most prosperous period is from New Year's Day to the fifth or sixth day of the new year, and after the fifth or sixth day, it gradually becomes less common. There are four types of lion dance troupes:</p>
<p>Qilin: This is mostly organized by residents of the city, and there are also villages in neighboring cities. This type of lion dance is the most outstanding because it has the most people and the equipment is also neat. The gongs and drums consist of a large cymbal, a loud drum, and a thick copper gong, which sound very loud and majestic. A unicorn head is made of bamboo and paper paste, given beautiful colors, and the whiskers and hair are made of velvet. A cloth of ten feet long and four feet wide is painted with colorful patterns to make the body. At the end of the cloth, a bunch of velvet is used to make the tail. When dancing, one person holds the unicorn head with both hands, and one person bows and bends over at the end of the tail. As soon as the gongs and drums sound, the two people dance various poses in the arena. After the dance, they perform boxing and staff, followed by one-on-one comparisons of weapons such as double knives and spears.</p>
<p>Lion: Most come from nearby villages. The performance is similar to the former, but the gongs and drums are different. The lion's head is flat and round, with a diameter of about two feet. One drum and two gongs are smaller than the former, and the sound is not as loud as the former. The knives, spears, and shields are also relatively small, but some add performances of several people comparing staffs and jumping on tables.</p>
<p>Guest Lion: These are also mostly played by nearby villages. They are probably very similar to "Lion," but the lion's head is not flat and round: it is more than a foot large and looks like a cat's head, and the mandible is movable and can be opened and closed. There are also four people outside the door, wearing masks, two in the shape of monkeys, and two as simpletons, following the lion's dance and making various humorous movements.</p>
<p>Out-of-Town Lion: These all come from other towns. The number of people is relatively small, and the lion's head and gongs and drums are the same as the Guest Lion, but there are no masks. The skills are relatively sophisticated. They often use several tables, and people perform various tricks on the table top.</p>
<p>In addition to the above four types of lion dances, the two that adults welcome more are "lantern wine" and "flower lanterns."</p>
<p>Lantern Wine: On the Lantern Festival, every family must prepare sacrificial offerings to worship the gods and ancestors. On this day, families in the streets and alleys who have raised boys in the past year will set up banquets. If there are families with public property in the clan, then the public will handle the banquet and drink in the ancestral hall. This is called "Lantern Wine." On this night, the bright moonlight and the brilliant lights reflect, doubly loud, mixed with the shouts and laughter of children. Groups of men and women stroll on the streets, watching flower lanterns and swings. The children carry paper lanterns and run around and pour wine randomly, wanting to be crazy with joy. This will continue until late at night before stopping.</p>
<p>Flower Lantern: Lanterns are made of straw and colored paper into figures and pavilions, arranged in a ring next to a tower-shaped frame made of bamboo strips and colored paper, or arranged next to a wooden frame about eight or nine feet long. This is called "Flower Lantern." This kind of flower lantern is mostly hung in the center of larger temples for people to enjoy. After the Lantern Festival, each person uses a strip of red paper and signs a "Respectfully requesting a flower lantern frame" and pastes it under the flower lantern. On the seventeenth day, the temple keeper of the temple will throw the paper signs pasted by each person in front of the gods one by one. The one with the most holy signs (one yin and one yang) will be given this flower lantern frame. When sending it, they beat gongs and drums all the way, playing fine music, and setting off firecrackers, which is also very lively.</p>

<p>Opening: "Childhood Sentiments" (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue)</p>
<p>In the dreary rain and sorrowful wind of the third watch of the night, tossing and turning in bed, unable to find peace. Like the weeping of a cuckoo, suddenly evoking memories of childhood. Remembering the beginning, loving and protecting each other like siblings, inseparable for even a single day. In those young and ignorant years, playing innocently together in the courtyard. Later, as we grew older and understood the meaning of spring breezes, we realized the depth of our feelings and spoke of love. Like intertwined branches, like two hearts beating as one, destined by fate in a previous life. Who knew that the Matchmaker's records held no destiny, and our names were not on the Three Lives Stone? Unexpectedly, my aunt took you to Japan, a tragic fate arranged by the heavens. Tears streamed down as we parted, and countless springs have passed in a flash. I trust you are happy with your husband, while I remain a pure and innocent virgin. Forgetting meals and tea, I still spend my days without a companion. Because of you, I am as thin as a rake and my appearance is haggard, my mind wandering in confusing dreams. Because of you, I defied my mother's wishes by being unworthy of marriage, I only love you with all my heart, but alas, you are nowhere to be found. Even the magpie bridge allows the Cowherd and Weaver Girl to meet, can we be together again in this life? Day and night, the thought breaks my heart.</p>

<p>Opening: "Sweeping Qin"</p>
<p>Don't laugh at the crazy and disheveled appearance, the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha intentionally descended to the mortal world. Using a body to meditate in Lingyin Temple, writing poems on the wall to "Sweep Qin." Nian Chun arrives, a prime minister of the court, holding three sticks of incense in his hands, silently communicating with the gods. Wishing for favorable weather and abundant harvests, only seeking longevity for the couple. Praying for the virtuous father and son of the Yue family to ascend to the immortal realm early. Raising his head, he suddenly sees the verses, causing the treacherous hero to tremble with fear. The poem was written with his wife, and when the incident was revealed, it was burned in a spring window fire. He immediately angrily asks for the mad monk to be summoned. Who knew that he would speak Zen secrets with many transformations, able to summon wind and rain. Holding a fire tube to communicate with foreign countries, also able to use a palm fiber broom to sweep away treacherous officials. The turmoil only arose from holding exclusive power, unjustly dying at Lengquan Pavilion. Returning home, the couple discussed together, shaving their heads and converting to Buddhism, renouncing fame and fortune. Believing the slander of a gossiping woman, suffering the punishments of Fengdu Hell, until now, cast in iron, the tomb of King Yue.</p>

<h3>New Contributions from the Paris Theater</h3>
<p>The Paris Theater, known for holding the screening rights of six major companies, has always been committed to serving the community. With brand new projectors and clear sound and light, it selects films carefully, taking the best and extracting the essence. The excellent reputation it has earned over the past year is universally acknowledged. Recently, it signed a contract with United Artists, an authority in the film industry. Films such as Chaplin's "Modern Times" will also be shown at the theater in turn. Holding so many screening rights is unprecedented among all theaters in Shanghai. It is also rumored that starting from the eve of the abolished lunar new year, the world-renowned all-color feature film "Ramona" has been selected. Anticipating crowds, early screenings will be added from the first to the fourth day of the lunar new year. During this New Year period, films such as "The Grievances of an Isolated Island," "Jingzhong Baoguo," and "Little Pearl" will be shown in succession. However, due to the excessive crowds for major films, the screening periods for each film have been shortened. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Grand Theater Shows "Paradise on Earth" During the Abolished Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>The dazzling and unparalleled great color love giant film "Paradise on Earth" will be publicly screened at the Shanghai Grand Theater during the old lunar new year. Color films have always been an experiment in Hollywood, but "Paradise on Earth" has reached the pinnacle of perfection and beauty. The director uses the extraordinary strengths of color films everywhere, using moving shots to poetically reveal the most complex, most wonderful, and most highly exciting emotions and images. The protagonist in the film is the mysterious actress Marlene Dietrich. Marlene's previous films have long been household names. In this film, she plays a lovestruck young girl, demonstrating even more consummate skill. Co-starring with her is Joel McCrea. Since Joel's debut in "These Three," this film is truly the actor's masterpiece, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Beginning of the Theater Year: "1937 Theater Society" is Born</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that 1937 is considered the year of theater. Following public performances by Zhonglu and amateur groups, the "1937 Theater Society" has also emerged in response and will soon announce its birth, holding its first public performance in a brand new manner.</p>
<p>The naming of the "1937 Theater Society" is perfectly suited to the significance of the year of theater and will undoubtedly remain a memorial in the history of Chinese theater. They are currently actively preparing, and the script is said to be temporarily unannounced, but it is expected to be a powerful work of national defense drama.</p>
<h3>Xie Jun in "New Year's Money"</h3>
<p>A young painter, a young man with artistic cultivation and enthusiasm, with an active and burning heart, jumped into the film garden. His dedication, his efforts, and the future glorious harvest can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Xie Jun, his joining the cast of Mingxing Film Company was not long ago, but his name is already quite familiar to the audience. In "Night Meeting," he played a纨袴 young master, performing the personality and behavior of that kind of person vividly and thoroughly. His amazing talent has since given people a considerable understanding. In "Living and Dying Together," "Qingming Season," and recently "The Eternal Smile," he has played very important roles. The future of this newcomer is bright and splendid.</p>
<p>Now, in Zhang Shichuan's new film "New Year's Money," he plays the father of a poor child, Xiao Sanzi, wearing old and dirty clothes, a couple with Shu Xiuwen, living in a small thatched hut. His child goes everywhere to pick up garbage every day. One day, he accidentally finds a dollar in the trash can, and happily rushes home to show Xie Jun and his wife.</p>
<p>"One dollar" is unremarkable to some people, but for those who are struggling to make ends meet, it is like finding a treasure. The couple competes to look at it, and all the neighbors around come to admire this "one dollar." With many people and many hands, snatching and grabbing, suddenly a fire breaks out in one of the thatched huts. Everyone is busy putting out the fire, and the cries and shouts create chaos. As a result, these many thatched huts are all destroyed for looking at "one dollar," and from then on, that dollar is also buried in the burned site. In this scene, Xie Jun's performance is particularly moving. When it is publicly screened, you will know that this statement is true.</p>
<h3>Bai Yang's Dream</h3>
<p>Silver moon, silver stars, silver weeping willows, silver plantain, silver grass… In this all-silver garden, Bai Yang, the heroine of "Crossroads," dressed in a 19th-century French girl's costume, exposing her snow-white shoulders and arms, innocently and happily sitting on a swing.</p>
<p>Her beloved, Zhao Dan (the hero of "Crossroads"), came. She smiled warmly and waved to Zhao Dan. Zhao Dan approached her, and the flames of love hidden in their hearts burned passionately, embracing tightly, kissing, kissing.</p>
<p>However, with the sound of a rooster crowing, Bai Yang's dream woke up. She was not in the silver garden, and her beloved Zhao Dan was nowhere to be seen. She felt disappointment and sadness.</p>
