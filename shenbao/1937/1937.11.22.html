<h3>九國公約會議今日開末次會議</h3>
<p>依據宣言考慮共同態度　和平國家怯於反抗侵略　會議失敗列强難辭其咎</p>
<p>比京　九國公約會議定於二十二日賡續開會、以便依照宣言書最後一段之所規定、考慮共同態度、美國首席代表台維斯·英國代理首席代表馬爾康麥唐納·頃與九國公約會議主席卽比國前外長斯巴克進行談話、對於會議議事日程、會商甚久、中國首席代表卽該國駐法大使顧維鈞、頃已自巴黎行抵此、（中央社二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比京　九國公約會議歐洲各代表今日在此問表示、美國方面之嚴格中立怯、使國際調停遠東糾紛陷於絕望云各代表將於下星期一再會集一次、大約正式表决、認日本在中國之行動純係侵略政策、英外相艾登及法外相台爾博斯因確知美國不與他國聯合制止日本之壓追、在末次會議時已决定不出席云、據一般觀察、歐洲外交家對於此次會議之無甚效力、或會責備美國、中國代表對此會議之結果尤感失望、據云、此次九國會議之失敗、乃表示愛好和平之民族均怯於反抗侵略也、據此間今日消息、於下星期一末次會議時、或會提出一新議案、另組織一委員會、包括美國·法蘭西·及比利時、對於遠東問題繼續研究、若情形好轉、該委員會或有重新召集大會之望云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］參院外交委員會主席畢德門今日與國務部長赫爾會晤、其後畢氏稱、白魯塞爾方面批評九國公約會議之失敗、應由美國負責云云、殊屬可笑、因此次會議之舉行、原來希望其有何成就、若云他國囿於美國中立法之限制、而未能有所舉動、則可笑已極、卽使中立法之規定、竟出人意外而能更動、美國國會亦何能憑空主張、因白魯塞爾方面迄今猶無任何確切之建議云、畢氏以為以後美國當單獨行動惟仍儘量與他國合作云、（二十日國民電）</p>

<h3>羅斯福外交政策</h3>
<p>因比京會議失敗　國會內空氣不佳</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國會特別會議之第一週、未能成立任何建設性之議案、據云進展不滿意之原因、係在各黨派對於羅斯福總統之外交政策、贊成與反對活動甚力云、同時議員方面對於九國公約會議之結果、普遍表示厭惡、有謂美國被人戴上圈套、使負擔會議失敗之咎者、其餘則謂凡屬一切民主國家、均應平均負擔未採取强硬政策之過失云、議院休息室中之談話、則認英美商約之急劇進行，係用以掩蔽比京會議之潰敗、俾民衆之思潮地位、而不致匯集於九國公約會議“畏葸”紀錄之一事云、（中央社二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］據傳孤立派人士擬向國會提出請願書、要求召回九國公約會議本國代表台維斯、以免美國捲入遠東事件之漩渦、負責人士以為此說未必可靠、並謂台維斯當於九國公約會議結束之後、遄返本國、藉資休養云、（中央社二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄報論文斥日侵略</h3>
<p>［舊金山］此閒蘇俄領事館曾揭示莫斯科週刋上所載一文、該文直斥日軍為侵略者、並稱九國公約會議假若毫無動作、則必助成日本之野心、該文又謂、日本非至完全宰制中國、而將各國勢力驅出遠東、必不停止戰事、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>法國軍視越南得益</h3>
<p>［巴黎］殖民部長穆戴、頃向報界發表談話略謂、法國各殖民地有設置適當防禦之必要、政府茲已籌獲巨額經費、用以革新各殖民地海空兩軍、至以遠東而言、法國在太平洋方面所保有之利益、至為重大、而尤以法屬越南為最、因此越南總督公署與法國駐遠東各國使領館之間、卽當常川保持聯絡云、（中央社二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>菲列濱放棄獨立</h3>
<p>菲總統奎松建議　美議員表示贊同</p>

<h3>列山隨筆</h3>
<p>— 馮列山</p>
<p>蘇俄與猶太人</p>
<p>猶太人，大約是世界上最不幸的民族，他們中間雖有一部分入擁有金錢，怛仍避免不掉到處受到人家的歧視。希特勒并不是“反猶”的發明家，他不過把猶太問題特別誇張起來，於是乎大家就覺得他的面目特別可怕。其實，徘斥猶太人的觀念，在歐洲民間幾乎成為一種普遍的現象，例外的，只有社會主義者并“人道主義者。也只有這批人才不談及種族問題。</p>
<p>帝俄時代，俄國的猶太人也算是被壓迫民族間的一個。當蘇俄的革命運動爆發時，猶太人是主要的中堅份子。例如托洛斯基，季諾維也夫，加米業夫，拉的克，越飛，李維諾夫等等。據說那時候曾有人向列寗質問過，為什麼他的左右過半數都是猶太人，這一定要引起俄國人民的反感。列寗記，俄國人民是產業落後國家的人民，要完成無產階級革命，只有用托洛斯基等人。這里不應分為誰是俄國人誰是猶太人。從此以後，猶太人在蘇俄不但得到了平等待遇，甚至於在政治上更擁有不少實權。列寗死後，托洛斯基被逐，斯太林獨握政權，而猶太人在蘇俄的地位始終并沒有動搖。大約在一二年前，有一位蘇俄國籍的猶太人曾對人表示，在蘇俄居住的猶太人都覺得十分幸福，他們再也沒有別的希望的了。是的將蘇俄的猶太人同其餘各國的猶太人此較起來，自然他們有可以滿意的理由。</p>
<p>雖然，這種現象能否長久維持下去，似乎是一個問題，猶太人在蘇俄是少數民族，而政權方面却居領導的地位。斯太林與托洛斯基兩派人的互爭政權，重要的原因，固然由於政見與思想上衝突的結果，但另一爾却也不無一些俄羅斯人與猶太人間爭執的痕跡。近來常有人說，斯太林受了希特勒種族論的影響，變成了大俄羅斯國家主義者，說不定將來他也會開始排猶。這種說法，自然是對斯太林開玩笑。不過，事情又是那末湊巧，半年來先後在莫斯科開審的三大反革命案。案中的主角，十之八九都是猶太人。因之，也引起了我們的一種疑問，這批人是否因為同是猶太人的緣故而與托洛斯基聯絡，希望恢復前幾年的黃金時代？</p>
<p>不管德報怎樣去攻擊斯太林，說他並蘇俄的政治全部猶太化。理由只為了已去世的斯太林夫人是一個猶太女子。其實年來斯太林的政治設施，似乎可以得到一個相反的結論。這是否由於預定的計劃或偶然的事實，那是另外一個問題。斯太林不但把紅軍由托洛斯基手中搶過來，將內政部長一職由猶太人換上了一個道地的俄羅斯人。（內政部就是從前著名的政治警察局。）甚至於素來在猶太人一手包辦下的蘇俄外交部最近也有所更動。新近蘇俄的駐德大使（猶太人）調任為駐法大使，（聽說，繼任的人物將為俄羅斯人。）原駐法大使普鄧金，（一個道地的俄羅斯人，）調任為外交副委員長。自從前外長齊齊林去職以來，俄羅斯人在蘇俄外交部中任這麼重要的職務，這還是第一次。</p>
<p>年來在蘇俄時有反革命案件發生，內容複雜，我們所讀到的消息，也十分矛盾。蘇俄當局雖絕口不提起猶太人問題，但我們綜合了各方面的事實，總覺得不無一些“蛛絲馬跡”，這一點也許可以帮助我們去了解蘇俄目前的黨爭，說不定斯太林的處置方法，還是代表了多處蘇俄人民的意見！自然，這是一種說法。不過它在蘇俄黨爭中到底是不是一個重要的原因，那還是讓蘇俄問題的專家去研究吧！</p>
<p>做新聞記者難</p>
<p>新聞記者這碗飯是不容易吃的。同行中許多老前輩都拿這句話來警告我們。他們的意思並不只說新聞記者的地位困難，懂得的事情並不見得，就能夠全盤寫出，因之對於讀者發生了良心問題，有欺騙讀者的嫌疑‥另一面，新聞記者是社會的報告員，他的責任是每日向讀者毫無錯誤地報告社會上的各種事變，這一來，每個記者對於各方面就應該具有充分的常識。一個人要變成了一部百科全書，談何容易！有許多有學問的專家，時常感到報紙上的文章淺薄。在我們看來，沒有寫錯，就稍嫌淺薄也算已經盡了我們的責任。因為專家在我們眼中只是一種極少數的讀者，說得粗魯一點，我們所寫的東西，根本就不是給專家看的。我們的對象是讀者大衆！</p>
<p>一位學者花了幾年或幾十年時間去從事著作，那末他的作品自然不容易錯誤。一個新聞記者那有這種福氣。他的寫作都完成於十分短促的時問中，幾小時內不及趕出，第二天新聞就要變成舊聞，還有那一位讀者願意讀它。恰為的過於怱忙的緣故，時有鬧笑話的危險，這是古今中外記者的通病，問題只在於大錯與小錯的分別而已。此較可以說是例外的，只有英美兩國的報紙。這兩個國家的報業大半都是規模宏大，內勤記者起碼有幾十人。每篇新聞都要經過好幾個人的修改潤色然後付印。於是乎英美兩國報紙的笑話來得比較少一點。</p>
<p>舉一個例，去年英王愛德華第八遜位的消息傳出以後，德國德意志通訊社的駐英記者卽連忙發專電到德國去，說是新王阿爾伯特第一卽將繼位。當天許多德報就照樣印出，這位記者因為過於急忙一點，便鬧了這個錯誤。原來從前維多利亞女王的親王丈夫是呌做阿爾伯特，為的這個緣故，目前的英王不是阿爾伯特第一，而是喬治第六，再如今夏英國老社會主義者蘭司勃萊（前工黨領袖）赴柏林拜訪希特勒，討論世界和平問題，德宣傳部長哥白爾司博士的機關報，攻擊報，却稱蘭氏為蘭司勃萊勳爵，這種稱呼法也許別有用意，但蘭氏不是貴族，却為人所共知的事實，於是乎就發生了記者的常識問題，英德相隔甚近，尚這麼容易鬧笑話，可見做新聞記者難。</p>
<p>記得去年有一位歐洲某報的總編輯，（是一名記者）寫了一篇社論，關於中國的問題，文中把蘭州並甘肅算做是中國的兩省，還有，去年秋天中國足球隊在倫敦比賽時，有好幾家英國大報都說李惠堂是醫科的學生，並且說，這位醫學生踢得很不錯，李惠堂為什麼無緣無故改了行，我想來想去總想不出答案來。</p>

<h3>初步談話圓滿結束英樞相離柏林返國</h3>
<p>德外長將正式聘問倫敦　澄淸歐局有待未來談判</p>
<p>［柏林］英國樞密大臣哈立法克斯勛爵、今晨自貝許德斯加登鎮返抵此間之後、該國大使漢特森爵士當於晚間設宴加以款待、德國政府閣員多人亦均被邀參加、哈立法克斯勛爵現定於明日啟程返國、據一般人所知、勛爵此行、與德國當局所討論者、係以西歐公約締結問題為主、全殖民地問題則並未討論及之云、（中央社二十一日哈瓦電）</p>
<p>［柏林］官方今日向美聯社稱、元首希特勒已將“令人可信之證據”、詔示哈立法克斯子爵、表示希氏確願維持歐洲之和平、哈氏已請外長牛賴特赴英續商、將來牛氏若與英外相艾登會晤、卽可以現在之非正式談話、加以正式交涉之意味、據悉德國之主張、為與英國成立雙方之諒解、與法國所主張之“集體”絛約不同、故他國外交界咸覺德國之主張難以成功、因英法兩國之關係甚深、英國當不願為與德國成立諒解、而損壞英法間之感情云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>［柏林］今日戈林將軍請哈立法克斯勛爵午餐、據稱、哈氏赴宴當與國防部長白倫堡·國家銀行總裁沙赫特晤及、據此間政界人士指陳希哈此次談話、對於歐局緊張情勢之原因、均曾加以探討、哈氏對於德義軸心之眞實性已能認識、卽德國締結是項軸心、並無敵對其他國家之意向是也（二十日海通電）</p>
<p>［柏林］關於英國樞密大臣哈立法克斯勛爵邀請德外長牛賴特前往倫敦一事、德國政府已在實際上表示接受、但事實尚須在外交上有所佈置、未必在聖誕節之前卽可籌備就緒、關於此層有須加以注意者、卽德國方面旣堅持英國必須承認該國享有平等權利、始允賡續進行談話、而德國業已應允將殖民地問題擱置不談、並願成立洛迦諾新公約、用以保障歐洲西部各國邊境之說、亦由德國消息靈通人士加以否認、似此、未來西歐公約卽使成立、德國雖鄭重聲明保障比國中立、而以其他各國接受同樣約束為條件、其對於南歐東歐、究抱何種態度、旣未有所洩露、自亦無知之、此際所可得而言者、乃德國外交當局對於未來談判、凡涉及集體安全原則者、應當拒不參加、德國外交界人士並謂、國聯會盟約若一日不予以修正、則德國對於國聯會所持態度、卽一日不能加以變更云、（中央社二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］此間一般人對於德外長牛賴特聘問英國一項消息、均感興趣、英國外交界人士并謂、樞密大臣哈立法充斯勛爵此次前往德國、與該國當局進行談話之後、關於該國對某某數項問題所具之見解、自已探詢明白、但雙方談話內容眞正價值如何、尚難加以估計因此、外間關於助爵此行之樂觀消息、雖可為之滿意、但亦當審愼處之云、（中央社二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於樞密大臣哈立法克斯勛爵訪德一事、保守黨機關報“觀察報”頃加以評論稱“哈立法克斯勛爵與德元首希特勒談話結果若非滿意、則哈立法克斯勛爵不致邀請德外長牛賴特前來倫敦進行談話、英德兩國官方人士咸信雙方現可採取第二步辦法、以使兩國成立諒解、所謂第二步辦法、卽提出切實方案、俾有所决定是也、此間一般人並以為英國政府若果不願坐失時機、則當及早向德國政府有所建議”云、（中央社二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］今日“漢堡新聞報”評論哈立法克斯勛爵聘德之行宣稱、哈立法克斯將以在德與希特勒談話之印象、報吿於英首相張伯倫、張氏固希望兩國成立諒解者、以後英德關係是否有更一步的進展、當一以張氏之决定為依歸、該報因指陳、此時若對是項問題先作推測、未免太早、蓋英國尚未根據哈氏所轉達之印象、决定英國之態度也、“柏林四社日報”力言、此次會談正當遠東及西班牙衝突、國際情勢異常緊張之時、一切世界政治局勢仍極幽暗、故吾人希望在英德兩國政治家進一步會商以前、對國際情形先予澄淸云、（二十一日海通電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］此間消息靈通人士宣稱、關於英國樞密大臣與德元首及其他要人談話之結果、法國外交部尚未接得正式報告、但由英國邀請德外長牛賴特赴英聘問一點觀之、此輩人士相信、貝許德斯加登鎭與柏林之談話結果、必甚爲滿意、政界方面認為希哈談話、必與中歐問題有關、且對德國重返國聯參加裁軍談判之可能性、異常感覺興趣、并表示若此種可能性一日實現、則今日所認為不能解决之問題、均將獲得解决之、（二十一日海通電）</p>

<p>［柏林］關於德國在蘇俄之領館關閉多處一節、此間政界人士聲明、此種變動乃因德國人民年來僑居俄土者、大為銳减、而德蘇間貿易亦大為低落之故、並稱、現下德國與蘇俄貿易有集中於莫斯科一地之趨向、故無保持前此多數領館之必要、除莫斯科外、德國以後在俄或僅設兩領館、一在基輔、一在諾伏西比斯克云、此間相信、蘇俄對在德領館亦將採取同樣辦法、裁去若干、僅於通商大港留置兩處云、（二十日海通電）</p>

<p>［巴黎］意國講壇報前日登載一文、主張促進法意兩國邦交之後、卽由該國政府下令予以扣留、此事頃由法國各報加以評論、晨報載稱、“該報所載之文、原可為法意兩國修好之堅固基礎、意政府竟在該報出版二十四小時之後、下令予以扣留、設非此擧在實際上不生效力者、誠可引以為憾矣、意者意國政府乃欲籍此表示法意兩國修好、必須在德意兩國軸心範圍之內行之歟”日報載稱、“意國政府此擧、未可以反對法意兩國修好視之、特該國不願首先有所發動、其扣留講壇報之所為、實乃對於該報駐巴黎訪員一文所提出之主張堅决加以否認”耳、（中央社二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>浦東歷險記</h3>
<p>— 方曙</p>
<p>從南高橋到北高橋</p>
<p>筆者於九月二十五日渡浦，總共住有五十多天，走遍了奉南川三縣，得知了當地的人民特性。現在姑就筆者記憶所及，將歷險經過，紀其梗槪：</p>
<p>十二月七日，在陰晦的早晨，敵機三架，開始轟炸奉賢縣的奉城，從早到晚，沒有一刻停止。在這時，有所謂別動隊，就開始他救國的工作。（臨時担任救護掩埋）第一天上午（八日），敵機六架，翱翔奉城之上，交替轟炸，下午換以大砲，每隔一分鐘，呼……轟的聲音，連連不絕的發作。當晚六時光景，砲聲寂然不久，而軋軋聲。撲面而來，轟的一聲，驚散了南高橋的民衆。事後調查，日軍又炸燬了天主堂的三間厨房，輕傷了兩位老百姓。我們駐地離奉城不到一里，爲避免無謂犧牲，向梁典移動。是夜，可以看到無恥漢奸施放各種不同的信號。十一日，回駐泰日鎭，當晚前哨兵捉來了兩個眞憑實據的漢奸，他口袋裹有施放信號的爆竹，白紡綢與小銅鈿偽輔幣，他不僅自己承認甘作漢奸，且招供了首領，立刻派人捉拿，以冀一綱打盡，但他早已得訊，逃逸無踪。結果，捉來了他的心腹，三次會審，漢奸行為，自認不諱，遂於十二日晨一時左右、砰砰砰三槍，結果了三個漢奸壽命。</p>
<p>十三日，我們到了新塲，正當我們早餐時，該鎭的新塲壯丁隊，與別動隊接觸，火併約二小時，打死了二個漢奸。這時，我們的伙伴散失了，剩下我和陶，當夜住南匯城內。</p>
<p>十四日臨時又加入了幾個伙伴，陶和我步行了五天，睡的是稻柴間，吃的是生蕃薯，大家都感覺到手足無力，不能前進，就雇了兩艘小船，小船在浦東是最好的交通器具。船到四團倉，所謂壯丁隊，名爲檢查，實則趁火打刦，把我們十二個患難伙伴由船中送到鎭公所，他們衆口一詞的說我們是漢奸，不能放走，後來經我和陶華三人一再說明，算放了我們。我們當時很感謝一位周先生，因爲他釋放我們，同時還代請嚮導，陪我們到竹家橋。可是漢奸畢竟是漢奸，心毒如默，我們正近竹家橋，砰砰砰……的槍聲大作起來，當時我們大家都莫明其妙，所以仍是前進，後來槍聲越發緊密了，一片喊殺聲，撲面而來。我們才知道槍聲的用意，一齊散開臥倒，我越田陌，跳河浜，伏在鐵軌中間的枕木上，以火車頭作掩護，漢奸的子彈，有七八次在我頭頂飛過，我忘記生與死，很鎭定的。可是痛心的是不死於眞正的敵人，而死於爲虎作倀的漢奸。後來他把我們用草䋲將雙手反缚，全身搜索一番，將僅有產業，收括一空；並把我們關在三間荒凉的空屋裹。成半圓形式坐在磚地上，又硬又冷，看看四周，佈滿了崗位，簡直把我們當作盜犯一樣看待。大槪隔了一小時，來了一位穿着中山裝的少年軍官，我們十二個伙伴上下打量一番就走了，我們毫不恐懼，預備着死，原來這位少年軍官就是保安隊，隔不多時，張與姓李的對我們說：“因爲你們與×××都有關係，所以放你們回去。”當然，我們在死望中得了生望，是異樣的快慰。下午四時，由竹家橋乘小火車到新陸，連夜趕到北高橋。十五日晨，意商船把我們九死一生的十二個伙伴送到上海。</p>
<p>最後，筆者得說明，浦東並沒有眞正　敵人，即有亦不過在沿浦登陸而去，並不駐留，所謂某處有日人，某處有日人，都是漢奸放的謠言。</p>

<p>義商華義公司之德平輪、因寗波軍事當局、已應寗波旅滬同鄉會之請、准德平輪復航、以便行旅、故該輸已將駛通之議打銷、提前於二十二日開甬、各情如次、</p>
<p>鎮海封鎖現狀</p>
<p>滬浙交通、自陸路中斷以來、祗藉水路滬甬一綫、勉為維持、故該綫之持續、不僅甬人稱便而已、惟寗波自本月五日、鎮海岸發生被敵艦砲擊、十二日甬埠又被敵機肆炸、當地軍事當局、遂在已經封鎖之鎮海口、增加防禦工事、面滬甬間交通、亦因而中斷、德平輪隨之一再滯滬、不克開行、</p>
<p>寗波覆電原文</p>
<p>寗波旅滬同鄉會、鑒於滬浙交通阻滯、滬甬航路、有賴寗波當局之勉力維持、藉安行旅、同時旅滬甬藉同鄉、亦紛請該會轉函甬當局、變通辦理、卽經該會一再電請寗波負責方面去後、昨日始得寗波方面復電、謂已面商王司令、陳縣長、俞警察局長、允予三日後復行、該會接電後、卽通知華義公司、</p>

<h3>滬市工廠損失</h3>
<p>總額逾八萬萬元　南市區尚不在內</p>
<p>新聲社云、上海市社會局奉實業部電詳査滬市工廠被毀損失佔計後、除公告各被毀廠南限期報告外、並將被毀工廠損失估計電復、新聲社記者昨向該局探悉、當時電復實業部、被毀工廠為二九九八家、損失五六四·五三五·二九七元、其工廠總數、依照戰前統計為五二五五家、損失估計南市百分之三十、閘北百分之百、特一百分之七十、四鄉百分之五十、特二無、當呈復之時、南市我軍尚未撒退、區內工廠大都完整、今南市已淪為戰區、工廠林立之日暉橋高昌廟等處、均已成焦土、照目前估計、應以百分之百計算、况該區工廠二二七二家、估總額三分之二以上、所以滬市工廠損失估計、當在國幣八萬萬元以上、</p>

<h3>蘇嘉綫戰局的變化</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>近日江浙國防綫上的戰事。又有顯著的變化。敵人方面因新增了數萬援軍。竟得在港汶地帶。逞意侵襲。我蘇州嘉與這雨個重要儂點。終于因戰略關係忍痛放棄了。現在我們所希望的是江陰至吳興一錢。我軍能作長期的堅守。同時我們能夠儘量運用遊擊戰術。消耗敵人的力量。這樣首都的地位就可以鞏固了。</p>
<p>首都的保衛。在我軍事當局是有極大的決心的。國府西邊重慶。而單把一切軍事機關留守在那裏。就是顯著的證明。西班牙共和軍用同樣的方式保衛瑪德里。得着很大的成功。願我們的首都也會有瑪德里那樣的光榮。</p>
<p>南京在地勢上和瑪德里當然有着很大的差别。也許未必能够守得像玛德里那麽長久罷。可是我国既然沒有陷於西班牙那樣分崩離析的境地。而這次對日戰爭對於仳界和平的影響又遠在西班牙戰爭以上。我國抗戰的前途。實在比西班牙更光明。只消我們把保衛首都的戰事支持到兩三月。國際方面和國內方面的有利形勢一定就可以判明了。</p>
<p>國府移荘重慶的實言。表示着寗為玉碎母為瓦全的決心並且說。此後將以更廣大之規模從事更持久之戰鬥。灑會這一種抗戰到底的堅決表示。我們相信首都一定可以保衛到相當的長久。即使日後不幸會有失陷的一天。抗戰的前途也決不是可悲觀的。</p>

<h3>I Abandon the Second Line of Defense in Changshu, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Elite Troops in the Battle of Jiangyin Have Been Sent as Reinforcements; Military Leaders in the Capital Remain in Beijing to Command the Defense; After the Fall of Nanxun, I Build New Positions in Gucun</p>
<p>After two weeks of bloody battles, the left wing of our army has safely withdrawn from Fushan, Changshu, and Suzhou to the new positions of Wuxi and Jiangyin. The enemy is now making every effort to attack the Jiangyin Fortress in an attempt to break through our Yangtze River blockade. Our rear army is currently building strong fortifications in Zhenjiang and deploying a second line of defense on the river in case of emergency. In the capital, the entire population is unusually calm, and military leaders remain in Beijing to command the defense. More than twelve divisions of elite troops are stationed in the suburbs of the capital, sufficient for a strong defense. Meanwhile, after the enemy broke through our important strongholds of Jiaxing and Zhapu on the right wing, our new positions now defend the areas of Changchuan Dam, Shendang, Xiashi, and Tongxiang east of Ganpu. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway, the enemy has already made contact with our forces near Haiyan. Fierce fighting is taking place between the enemy and us east of Wangdian on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line. Another part of the enemy army in the Jiaxing area has crossed our Nanxun defense line and is advancing towards Wuxing, attempting to invade Nanjing via the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. Our reinforcements have arrived in Gucun, and we are determined to fight to the death against the enemy.</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] On the morning of the 20th, there was heavy rain. The enemy attacked westward from Jiaxing, and our army engaged in fierce blocking battles in Wuzhen, reaching a stalemate by evening. The enemy from the Nanxun area attacked westward at noon on the 20th, making contact with our forces in Gucun, resulting in intense fighting. Several enemy planes bombed Shengshan at around 7:00 AM on the 20th, but the losses are unknown.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Attempts to Break the Jiangyin Blockade</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to reports from the Chinese side, Japanese warships have been heavily shelling Langshan and Fushan recently, with the obvious intention of breaking the blockade on the Jiangyin side. Furthermore, the fighting on the Suzhou-Jiaxing railway line is very intense, and Chinese reinforcements have been sent to the front lines to stop the enemy's advance. Therefore, new troops that opened the mountain from Nanjing are constantly on the way. (Central News Agency, 11th Reuters report)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to news from the Chinese side, Chinese troops in Fushan and Suzhou have retreated to new positions for strategic reasons and continue to resist the Japanese advance. Japanese troops in the Jiaxing area have crossed Nanxun and are advancing towards Wuxing, attempting to advance along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway.</p>
<h3>Our New Defense Line is 500 Li Long</h3>
<p>In the Eastern Theater, our enemy has been fighting for more than 100 days. The initial front line was only 70 li in Songhu. Since the enemy landed in Jinshanwei, it has been extended to more than 200 li. Recently, the fighting has spread to Jiangyin and Wuxi, and the front line has been extended to more than 500 li. Our army on this new defense line can definitely achieve the goal of moving from a war of attrition to a war of main forces.</p>
<p>The China Eastern News Agency stated that although Suzhou and Changshu have fallen and the first line of national defense has been broken through by the enemy, our current position is actually advantageous. A reporter from the China Eastern News Agency met with a foreign observer in this city yesterday, who said, "Even if the Japanese army currently uses its tanks and mechanized units, Chinese soldiers can still use the terrain to launch guerrilla tactics. I am afraid that the Japanese army will find it difficult to advance deep in the future. The Japanese Marines in the swamps and rivers will also inevitably be ambushed by Chinese troops in the mountains and ridges." The China Eastern News Agency stated that after the left wing of our army moved back, it still remotely echoed the right wing. At present, the right wing of our army, Shanhaining, Haiyan, Xiashi, Chang'an, and other important points bordering Taihu Lake, remotely form a vertical line with Wuxi and Jiangyin. The city of Hangzhou is normal and has not been greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Hasegawa Commands Two Fleets</h3>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reported that the Japanese Second and Third Fleets have now been merged into one, all under the command of Vice Admiral Hasegawa, and renamed the China Sea Fleet. Yesterday, Hasegawa ordered that from 6:00 PM on November 20th, all ships owned by the Chinese government and private individuals are prohibited from sailing in Chinese territorial waters.</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reported that yesterday (the 20th) at 4:45 PM, three tugboats towed a gray warship to the lower reaches of the Huangpu River. A Japanese flag was hanging behind the ship. The ship and tugboats apparently came from near the Jiangnan Shipyard. Subsequently, a Japanese naval spokesman claimed that the ship may be a Chinese gunboat, similar to a destroyer, and is one of the four ships estimated by the Japanese army. Two ships were towed to the lower reaches a few days ago, and one ship has now been requisitioned by the Japanese naval commander.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that the day before yesterday (the 20th), five enemy transport ships, including the No. 364 transport ship "Hoyo Maru," the No. 252 transport ship "Usong Maru," the No. 176 transport ship "Seiko Maru," the No. 13 transport ship "Kasoku Maru," and the unnamed No. 76 transport ship, carried more than 3,000 enemy reinforcements and landed at Zhanghuabang and Qiujiang Wharf. After the enemy troops landed, most of the ships sailed inland, mooring in the waters from Donggou to Huishan Wharf.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that yesterday morning (the 21st) around 7:00 AM, the enemy transport ships "Nachisan Maru" docked at the China Merchants Bureau Central Warehouse, "Someono Maru" docked at Osaka Wharf, "Daisan Keihin Maru" docked at the Fish Market Wharf, and "Yayoi Maru" docked at New Huishan Wharf, carrying large quantities of military supplies, ammunition, and timber rafts, which were unloaded ashore and onto small barges, ready to be transported to the front.</p>
<h3>The Battle Situation on the Pinghan Railway Line is in a Stalemate</h3>

<p>Xinxiang: The battle situation on the front and left wings of the Pinghan Railway Line has been in a stalemate for days. On the right wing, the enemy and our army are confronting each other along the Wei River. Furthermore, the militia groups near Daming have become increasingly active in recent days.

Subsequently, the military authorities appointed Xue Zhaoxiang as the commander of the 14th Guerrilla Detachment of Hebei Province. They repeatedly attacked the enemy in Pengchengzhen, Guangluzhen, and other places, establishing special merits. They are currently actively operating between Cixian and Handan. (Central News Agency, 21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Jinan] On the afternoon of the 20th, there was rain and snow in Jinan, and the weather turned cold. The front line was quite quiet.

<p>[Jinan] After our army on the Jinpu Railway Line transferred to the new positions on the south bank, there was an artillery battle across the river on the evening of the 17th. On the 18th, a part of our reinforced troops joined, and the sound of artillery gradually became audible and distant. It was heard that the enemy army had collapsed and retreated to Yancheng. The 19th was quiet all day. Han Fuju has now appointed a certain military commander as the commander of Jinan's martial law. All banks and shops have resumed business on the 20th, and the city is gradually returning to normal. (Central News Agency, 21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xi'an] A certain army of ours in northern Shanxi sent a telegram to Shaanxi stating: ① On the evening of the 15th, a part of our army, in coordination with the volunteer army, attacked Pingdiquan, defeating the enemy guards of 60 to 70 people.

<h3>Yu Youren's Speech in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Nanchang] President Yu Youren arrived in Jiangxi on the evening of the 20th. Reporters visited and he kindly received them and spoke as follows: I (President Yu referred to himself) relocated with the government from the Control Yuan, passing through Jiangxi Province, through Fuliang and other places, and saw the local people's spirit of common hatred against the enemy and the situation of comforting the soldiers. Upon arriving in the province, I saw the efforts of party, government, and military comrades, and I was very impressed. At this time of serious national crisis, what I can tell the people of the country is that the government's relocation is actually for the sake of implementing the spirit of resistance. As the declaration says, one is to prevent an alliance under the city, and the other is to strengthen the determination to resist, so that we can calmly plan for a large scale, so that the generals and soldiers in the front and the people in the rear know that the government has no intention of seeking temporary security. If everyone has the thought of laziness, they will be prisoners of the people in their hearts. If everyone can value themselves, unite their strength under the leadership of the central government, then everyone will be a defender of the city, and every place will be a stronghold. Our anti-enemy formation will definitely be stronger. Moreover, the international situation has already changed, and those who sympathize with us are now helping with real strength. We can gain the expectations of world justice, and we also have the supreme power of national unity. Although the enemy is fierce and cruel, the time to wipe them out is not far away. (Central News Agency, 21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Nine-Power Treaty Conference Will Hold its Final Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Consider a Common Attitude Based on the Declaration; Peaceful Countries Are Afraid to Resist Aggression; The Major Powers Cannot Shirk the Blame for the Failure of the Conference</p>
<p>Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to resume its meeting on the 22nd in order to consider a common attitude in accordance with the provisions of the final paragraph of the declaration. The chief representative of the United States, Davis, and the acting chief representative of the United Kingdom, Malcolm MacDonald, recently held talks with the chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, former Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, and consulted for a long time on the agenda of the conference. The chief representative of China, namely the country's ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, has arrived here from Paris. (Central News Agency, 20th Havas report)</p>
<p>Brussels: European representatives at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference stated here today that the strict neutrality of the United States has led to the despair of international mediation of the Far East dispute. The representatives will reconvene once next Monday, probably formally voting to recognize that Japan's actions in China are purely an aggressive policy. British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Dalbos, knowing that the United States would not join other countries to stop Japan's oppression, decided not to attend the last meeting. According to general observations, European diplomats may blame the United States for the ineffectiveness of this meeting. Chinese representatives are particularly disappointed with the results of this meeting, saying that the failure of this Nine-Power Conference indicates that peace-loving nations are afraid to resist aggression. According to news here today, a new proposal may be put forward at the final meeting next Monday to form another committee, including the United States, France, and Belgium, to continue to study the Far East issue. If the situation improves, the committee may have the hope of reconvening the general meeting. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with Secretary of State Hull today. Afterwards, Pittman said that it is ridiculous that Brussels criticized the United States for being responsible for the failure of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The holding of this conference was originally hoped to achieve something. If it is said that other countries are restricted by the United States' neutrality law and have failed to take action, then it is extremely ridiculous. Even if the provisions of the neutrality law are unexpectedly changed, what can the US Congress claim out of thin air, because Brussels has not yet made any concrete proposals. Pittman believes that the United States should act alone in the future, but still cooperate with other countries as much as possible. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] French Foreign Minister Dalbos successively received League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, and British Ambassador Phillips today. It is said that the conversations of these people were all related to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency, 20th Reuters report)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Due to the Failure of the Brussels Conference, the Atmosphere in Congress is Not Good</p>
<p>[Washington] The first week of the special session of Congress failed to establish any constructive bills. It is said that the reason for the unsatisfactory progress is that the parties are strongly active in supporting and opposing President Roosevelt's foreign policy. At the same time, members of Congress have generally expressed disgust with the results of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying that the United States has been trapped and is burdened with the blame for the failure of the conference. Others said that all democratic countries should share the blame for failing to take a strong policy. The conversations in the parliament lounge recognize that the rapid progress of the Anglo-American Commercial Treaty is used to cover up the collapse of the Brussels Conference, so that the public's thoughts and status will not converge on the "cowardice" record of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency, 21st Havas report)</p>
<p>[Washington] It is rumored that isolationists intend to submit a petition to Congress, requesting the recall of the country's representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Davis, to avoid the United States being involved in the whirlpool of the Far East incident. Responsible persons believe that this statement may not be reliable, and said that Davis will return to the country after the end of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to rest. (Central News Agency, 20th Havas report)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Article Criticizes Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>[San Francisco] The Russian Consulate in this city has posted an article published in the Moscow Weekly, which directly denounced the Japanese army as aggressors and said that if the Nine-Power Treaty Conference does nothing, it will help Japan's ambitions. The article also said that Japan will not stop the war until it completely dominates China and drives the forces of various countries out of the Far East. (20th National Telegram)</p>

<p>[Paris] Colonial Minister Moutet recently made a statement to the press, saying that it is necessary for France's various colonies to set up appropriate defenses. The government has now raised huge funds to innovate the naval and air forces of the various colonies. As far as the Far East is concerned, France's interests in the Pacific are very important, especially French Vietnam. Therefore, the Governor-General's Office of Vietnam and the French embassies and consulates in various Far Eastern countries should maintain regular contact.

<h3>The Philippines Give Up Independence</h3>
<p>Philippine President Quezon's Proposal; American Senators Express Support</p>
<p>[Washington] Republican Senator Gibson greatly supports Philippine President Quezon's proposal to give up independence and only demand autonomous status. According to his meaning, in the current situation in the Far East, it is more appropriate to make the Philippines obtain the status of a self-governing territory than complete independence. Democratic Senator McClellan claimed that making the Philippines completely independent is not only not beneficial to the Philippines, but also harmful to the United States. I deeply believe that if the Philippines is completely isolated and helpless, it will be swallowed up by other powerful countries. But if the Philippines only obtains the status of an autonomous territory, I do not agree. Only if we want to bear the responsibility of protection, we must manipulate its diplomatic rights and customs rights, and station powerful naval and land forces on the island. However, Tydings and others who drafted the Philippine Independence Act have not yet expressed their opinions. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Universities Raise Funds</h3>
<p>To Help the Expenses of Universities Outside My War Zone</p>
<p>[London] Students from British universities, seminaries, and technical colleges have now raised 1,500 British pounds to help maintain the expenses of universities outside the Chinese war zone. The British International Student Service has remitted 500 pounds in donations from Geneva and has been responsible for raising 4,000 pounds this year. (Central News Agency, 21st Reuters report)</p>
<h3>Commercial Shipping Between Shanghai and the United States</h3>
<p>Will Resume Soon</p>
<p>[New York] It is hoped that commercial shipping between Shanghai and the United States will be restored soon, because London has reduced the insurance costs of war insurance by 75%. The United States is expected to take the same action next week. In the initial stage, goods shipped to Shanghai may be shipped to any port for unloading if it is not convenient to unload in Shanghai. (Central News Agency, 21st Reuters report)</p>
<h3>A Model Soldier</h3>
<p>Returned from the Front Line and Unwilling to Return Home; Donates the Reward Money from His Superior to the Country</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: In this war of resistance against Japan in Shanghai, everyone fought bravely and desperately. The Feng Xingxian Department of the 33rd Division was particularly brave in resisting the enemy in Nanxiang. Ming Yanchen, a first-class soldier in the division, is from Hao County, northern Anhui Province, and is 34 years old. He is deeply admired by his peers for his bravery in combat. Recently, when he was in the process of reorganizing the troops, he was ordered to return home, and his superior rewarded him with 150 yuan in national currency for his mother to save money for him to marry a wife. Ming arrived in Bengbu by car a few days ago and stayed at the Huaiying Hotel behind the train station. Driven by patriotism, he voluntarily went to the Central Bank on the 11th and bought national salvation bonds for 50 yuan. Then he went to the Bengbu Anti-Enemy Support Association and donated 30 yuan to comfort the soldiers in the front. A reporter was introduced by someone and personally saw the receipts given by the two agencies. Ming was dressed in tattered military uniforms and looked extremely simple and honest, but his heroic spirit overflowed between his eyebrows. At first glance, he knew that he was a brave and good soldier. It is said that he joined the army five years ago. The troops fought in Nanxiang, and the officers and soldiers sacrificed a lot. He did not want to return home. When the troops are reorganized or there are other opportunities, he is still willing to go to the front line to kill the enemy and recover the lost land.</p>
<h3>Minyuan Held a Meeting to Promote Military Service and Raise Bonds</h3>
<p>[Fuzhou] People from all walks of life held a publicity meeting for military service, bond raising, and donations at the public sports field today. More than 50,000 people attended with great enthusiasm. Chen Yi and Chen Zhaoying both came to give instructions. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Random Notes from Lieshan</h3>
<p>— Feng Lieshan</p>
<p>Soviet Russia and the Jews</p>
<p>The Jews are perhaps the most unfortunate people in the world. Although some of them possess wealth, they still cannot avoid being discriminated against everywhere. Hitler was not the inventor of "anti-Semitism." He merely exaggerated the Jewish problem in particular, and as a result, everyone found his face particularly terrifying. In fact, the idea of excluding Jews has almost become a common phenomenon in European society. The only exceptions are socialists and "humanitarians." Only these people do not talk about racial issues.</p>
<p>During the Tsarist era, Russian Jews were also among the oppressed nationalities. When the Soviet revolutionary movement broke out, the Jews were the main backbone. For example, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Radek, Joffe, Litvinov, and so on. It is said that someone once questioned Lenin, asking why more than half of his close associates were Jews, which would inevitably arouse the resentment of the Russian people. Lenin replied that the Russian people were from an industrially backward country, and only people like Trotsky could complete the proletarian revolution. There should be no distinction between who is Russian and who is Jewish here. Since then, Jews in Soviet Russia have not only received equal treatment, but have even had considerable real power in politics. After Lenin's death, Trotsky was expelled, and Stalin took sole control of power, but the status of Jews in Soviet Russia has never wavered. About a year or two ago, a Soviet citizen of Jewish origin once said that the Jews living in Soviet Russia felt very happy and had no other hopes. Yes, comparing the Jews of Soviet Russia with the Jews of other countries, they naturally have reasons to be satisfied.</p>
<p>However, whether this phenomenon can last seems to be a question. Jews are a minority in Soviet Russia, but they occupy a leading position in the government. The power struggle between Stalin and Trotsky was mainly due to the conflict of political views and ideas, but another reason was also the trace of conflict between Russians and Jews. Recently, it has often been said that Stalin was influenced by Hitler's racial theory and became a Great Russian nationalist, and that he might start to exclude Jews in the future. This statement is naturally a joke about Stalin. However, things are so coincidental that the three major counter-revolutionary cases that have been tried in Moscow in the past six months have been headed by Jews in eight or nine out of ten cases. As a result, it has also raised a question in our minds as to whether these people are in contact with Trotsky because they are all Jews, hoping to restore the golden age of a few years ago?</p>
<p>No matter how the German newspapers attack Stalin, saying that he has completely Judaized Soviet politics, the reason is only because Stalin's deceased wife was a Jewish woman. In fact, Stalin's political measures in recent years seem to lead to the opposite conclusion. Whether this is due to a predetermined plan or an accidental fact is another matter. Stalin not only seized the Red Army from Trotsky's hands, but also replaced the Minister of the Interior, a Jew, with a genuine Russian. (The Ministry of the Interior is the former famous political police bureau.) Even the Soviet Foreign Ministry, which had always been monopolized by Jews, has recently undergone changes. The newly appointed Soviet ambassador to Germany (a Jew) has been transferred to be the ambassador to France. (It is said that the successor will be Russian.) The original ambassador to France, Potemkin (a genuine Russian), was transferred to be the Deputy Commissar of Foreign Affairs. Since the former Foreign Minister Chicherin left office, this is the first time that a Russian has held such an important position in the Soviet Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>In recent years, counter-revolutionary cases have occurred from time to time in Soviet Russia. The content is complicated, and the news we read is very contradictory. Although the Soviet authorities never mention the Jewish issue, we have synthesized the facts from all aspects and always feel that there are some "clues." This point may help us understand the current party struggle in Soviet Russia. Perhaps Stalin's handling methods still represent the opinions of many Soviet people! Of course, this is a statement. However, whether it is an important reason in the Soviet party struggle is still up to the experts on Soviet Russia to study!</p>
<p>It's Hard to Be a Journalist</p>
<p>It is not easy to make a living as a journalist. Many senior veterans in the industry warn us with these words. What they mean is not just that the status of journalists is difficult. It is not necessarily possible to write out everything that is known, so there is a moral problem for readers, and there is a suspicion of deceiving readers. On the other hand, journalists are reporters of society. Their responsibility is to report various social events to readers accurately every day. In this way, every journalist should have sufficient common sense in all aspects. How easy it is for a person to become an encyclopedia! Many knowledgeable experts often feel that the articles in the newspapers are shallow. In our opinion, if we have not made any mistakes, it is already our responsibility to be slightly shallow. Because experts are only a very small number of readers in our eyes. To put it bluntly, what we write is not for experts at all. Our target is the general public of readers!</p>
<p>A scholar spends several years or decades writing a book, so his work is naturally not prone to error. A journalist does not have this blessing. His writing is completed in a very short period of time. He has to rush out in a few hours, and the news will become old news the next day. Which reader is willing to read it? Precisely because of the excessive haste, there is always a risk of making jokes. This is a common problem for journalists at home and abroad, the only question is the difference between big mistakes and small mistakes. The only exceptions are newspapers in the United Kingdom and the United States. Most of the newspaper industry in these two countries is large-scale, and there are at least dozens of internal affairs reporters. Every news article has to be revised and embellished by several people before it is printed. As a result, there are fewer jokes in British and American newspapers.</p>
<p>For example, after the news of King Edward VIII's abdication last year, the British correspondent of the German Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur hurriedly sent a special telegram to Germany, saying that the new King Albert I was about to succeed to the throne. Many German newspapers printed it as it was that day. The reporter made this mistake because he was too hurried. Originally, Queen Victoria's prince consort was called Albert. For this reason, the current King of England is not Albert I, but George VI. Nowadays, the old British socialist Lansbury (former leader of the Labour Party) went to Berlin to visit Hitler to discuss world peace issues. Dr. Goebbels' mouthpiece, the propaganda minister of Germany, called Lansbury Lord Lansbury, which may have other intentions, but the fact that Lansbury is not an aristocrat is well known. As a result, the common sense problem of journalists arises. England and Germany are so close to each other, and it is so easy to make jokes. It can be seen that it is difficult to be a journalist.</p>
<p>I remember that last year, the editor-in-chief of a European newspaper (who was a reporter) wrote an editorial about China. The article regarded Lanzhou and Gansu as two provinces in China. Also, last autumn, when the Chinese football team was competing in London, several major British newspapers said that Li Huitang was a medical student, and said that this medical student played very well. Why did Li Huitang change his career for no reason? I have thought about it and I can't figure out the answer.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Talks Conclude Satisfactorily, British Privy Councillor Leaves Berlin for Home</h3>
<p>German Foreign Minister to Formally Invite London, Clarification of European Situation Awaits Future Negotiations</p>
<p>[Berlin] After British Privy Councillor Lord Halifax returned to Berlin this morning from Berchtesgaden, the British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson hosted a banquet in his honor in the evening. Many German government officials were also invited to attend. Lord Halifax is scheduled to return home tomorrow. It is generally understood that the main topic of discussion between the Councillor and the German authorities was the conclusion of the Western European Treaty, while the colonial issue was not discussed at all. (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)</p>
<p>[Berlin] An official told the Associated Press today that Führer Hitler had shown Viscount Halifax "credible evidence" indicating that Hitler was truly willing to maintain peace in Europe. Halifax had requested Foreign Minister Neurath to go to England for further discussions. If Neurath meets with British Foreign Secretary Eden in the future, the current informal talks can be given the significance of formal negotiations. It is understood that Germany's position is to establish a mutual understanding with Britain, which is different from France's proposed "collective" treaty. Therefore, diplomatic circles in other countries feel that Germany's position is difficult to achieve because the relationship between Britain and France is very deep, and Britain would not want to harm the relationship between Britain and France in order to establish an understanding with Germany. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today, General Göring invited Lord Halifax to lunch. It is said that Halifax will meet with Defence Minister Blomberg and National Bank President Schacht at the banquet. According to political figures here, the causes of the tense situation in Europe have been explored in these talks. Halifax has been able to recognize the authenticity of the German-Italian Axis, that is, Germany's conclusion of this axis has no intention of hostility towards other countries. (Haitong Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the British Privy Councillor Lord Halifax's invitation to German Foreign Minister Neurath to visit London, the German government has practically expressed its acceptance, but in fact, there still needs to be some diplomatic arrangements. It may not be possible to prepare it before Christmas. What needs to be noted in this regard is that since Germany insists that Britain must recognize its right to equal rights before it is willing to continue talks, and Germany has already agreed to put aside the colonial issue and is willing to establish a new Locarno Treaty to protect the borders of Western European countries, this has also been denied by well-informed German sources. In this way, even if a future Western European Treaty is concluded, although Germany solemnly declares that it will protect Belgian neutrality, it will only do so on the condition that other countries accept the same restrictions. What kind of attitude it holds towards Southern and Eastern Europe has not been revealed, and naturally no one knows. What can be said at this time is that the German diplomatic authorities should refuse to participate in future negotiations that involve the principle of collective security. German diplomatic figures also said that if the League of Nations Covenant is not amended one day, Germany's attitude towards the League of Nations will not be changed for one day. (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] People here are generally interested in the news that German Foreign Minister Neurath has been invited to Britain. British diplomatic figures also said that after Privy Councillor Lord Halifax went to Germany to hold talks with the German authorities, he had clearly inquired about the German views on certain issues. However, it is difficult to estimate the real value of the content of the talks. Therefore, although optimistic news about the Councillor's trip can be satisfactory, it should also be treated with caution. (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Privy Councillor Lord Halifax's visit to Germany, the Conservative Party's organ newspaper "The Observer" recently commented, "If the results of Lord Halifax's talks with German Führer Hitler were not satisfactory, Lord Halifax would not have invited German Foreign Minister Neurath to come to London for talks. Officials from both Britain and Germany believe that both sides can now take a second step to establish an understanding between the two countries. The so-called second step is to propose a concrete plan to make a decision. People here also believe that if the British government does not want to miss the opportunity, it should make suggestions to the German government as soon as possible." (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today, the "Hamburger Nachrichten" commented on Lord Halifax's visit to Germany, declaring that Halifax would report the impression of his talks with Hitler in Germany to British Prime Minister Chamberlain. Chamberlain hopes that the two countries will establish an understanding. Whether there will be further progress in British-German relations in the future will depend on Chamberlain's decision. The newspaper pointed out that it would be too early to speculate on this issue at this time, because Britain has not yet decided its attitude based on the impression conveyed by Halifax. The "Berliner Vier-Uhr-Blatt" emphasized that the meeting took place at a time when the Far East and Spain were in conflict and the international situation was extremely tense. The entire world political situation is still very gloomy. Therefore, we hope that the international situation will be clarified before the British and German politicians hold further consultations. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] Well-informed sources here have declared that the French Foreign Ministry has not yet received a formal report on the results of the British Privy Councillor's talks with the German Führer and other dignitaries. However, judging from the fact that Britain has invited German Foreign Minister Neurath to visit Britain, these people believe that the results of the talks in Berchtesgaden and Berlin must be very satisfactory. Political circles believe that the Halifax-Hitler talks must be related to the Central European issue and are extremely interested in the possibility of Germany returning to the League of Nations to participate in disarmament talks. They also stated that if this possibility is realized one day, all the problems that are considered unsolvable today will be solved. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Visit Berlin</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Hungarian Prime Minister Darányi and Foreign Minister Kánya arrived here this morning and immediately met with Führer Hitler and met with the dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, General Göring, and Foreign Minister Neurath. (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)</p>
<h3>Italy to Close Five Consulates in Russia</h3>
<p>German Consulates Also to Be Reduced</p>
<p>[Moscow] Diplomatic negotiations between the Soviet and Italian governments on the issue of consulates have ended today. As a result, the Italian government agreed to close its consulate general in Kyiv, consulates in Leningrad and Tbilisi, and vice-consulates in Novosibirsk and Batumi before January 20 next year. (TASS Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the closure of several German consulates in Soviet Russia, political figures here stated that this change was due to the sharp decline in the number of Germans residing in Russia over the years, and the great decline in German-Soviet trade. They also said that there is now a tendency for German-Soviet trade to be concentrated in Moscow, so there is no need to maintain the previous large number of consulates. In addition to Moscow, Germany will only establish two consulates in Russia in the future, one in Kyiv and one in Novosibirsk. It is believed here that Soviet Russia will take the same approach to German consulates, closing some and only leaving two in major commercial ports. (Haitong Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japan to Recognize the Spanish Rebel Government Soon</h3>
<p>Salamanca - The Associated Press learned today from authoritative sources that the Spanish Chargé d'Affaires in Japan has reached an agreement with the Japanese government that Japan will soon formally recognize the Nationalist government. It is understood that at the beginning of the civil war, Japan was negotiating a treaty with Spain. Now this treaty will be signed by the Nationalist government. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Italian Giornale d'Italia Advocates Promoting Relations with France</h3>
<p>Confiscated by the Authorities</p>
<p>[Rome] The Giornale d'Italia here published an article yesterday advocating the promotion of friendly relations between France and Italy. The authorities recently ordered the confiscation of the newspaper issued yesterday. It is generally believed that since the British-German talks, foreign newspapers have said that Italy intends to make peace with France in order to respond. In order to prevent the spread of this argument, the Italian authorities confiscated the Giornale d'Italia. (Central News Agency, Havana, 20th)</p>
<p>[Paris] After the Italian Giornale d'Italia published an article the day before yesterday advocating the promotion of friendly relations between France and Italy, it was ordered to be confiscated by the Italian government. This matter has recently been commented on by French newspapers. Le Matin reported, "The article published by the newspaper could have been a solid foundation for improving relations between France and Italy. The Italian government actually ordered it to be confiscated 24 hours after the newspaper was published. It would be regrettable if this move were not actually effective. Does the Italian government intend to express that the improvement of relations between France and Italy must be carried out within the scope of the German-Italian Axis?" Le Journal reported, "This move by the Italian government cannot be regarded as opposing the improvement of relations between France and Italy. It just does not want to take the initiative to initiate it. Its confiscation of the Giornale d'Italia is actually a firm denial of the views put forward in an article by the newspaper's Paris correspondent." (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)</p>
<h3>Belgian Cabinet Stillborn</h3>
<p>Johnson's Cabinet Formation Fails Again</p>
<p>Brussels - Former Belgian cabinet member Johnson, a member of the Liberal Party, has also declared his failure after being authorized by the Belgian King to form a cabinet. It is said that the reason for his failure is that the Socialist Party refused to work with former Catholic Prime Minister Jaspar. It has been nearly a month since Belgium has been in a state of anarchy since Tsiran resigned. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>Conspiracy to Overthrow the Government Uncovered in Paris</h3>
<p>Authorities Take Stringent Measures to Suppress the Budding of Disorder, Many Extreme Right-Wingers Expelled</p>
<p>[Paris] According to a reliable source, the authorities uncovered the conspiracy to overthrow the government this time thanks to a tip-off from Rocque, the former leader of the Croix-de-Feu. This conspiracy is consistent with the views of the Croix-de-Feu, but its leaders are extremists, and Rocque does not approve of using violent means, so their views diverge, and they reported it to the government. At the same time, the Ministry of the Interior announced that the government has completely investigated the inside story of the conspiracy. None of the leaders can hope to escape the net. Thousands of detectives have been secretly deployed at all border crossings, airports, and train stations to prevent these leaders from fleeing the country before the list is announced. Currently, this list has not yet been announced, and there are rumors that it is related to "a certain country." (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] When the truth about the revolutionary conspiracy detected by the government is announced, it will reveal an extremely scandalous history. It is still remembered that before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the government also discovered a revolutionary organization. Therefore, the government authorities are taking strict measures to suppress this movement. After Prime Minister Chautemps obtained the power to handle this matter in the House of Representatives yesterday, 87 right-wing figures sympathetic to the Spanish Nationalist government have been expelled from the country today. Another hundred people will be expelled next week. According to official statements, the sources of support for the conspiracy are mostly on the border crossings. The government has seized countless military supplies, and important military locations have secretly hidden radio equipment. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>[Paris] French police authorities are now mobilizing nationwide to search for members of secret organizations attempting to harm the country. According to an official from the police, the truth about the discovery of the conspirators' arsenals and financial resources will be announced soon. Traffic on railways and airlines is currently being closely monitored to prevent the leaders of the secret organization from escaping abroad. As of now, none of the names of the conspirators have been announced, but the police have learned that many prominent figures are involved. (Haitong Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Parliament Dissolved, Re-election</h3>
<p>[Rome] It has been formally announced here that the parliament has been dissolved. The election for the Lower House is scheduled to be held on December 20. The election for the Upper House is scheduled to be held on December 22. The new parliament will convene on February 17 next year. (Haitong Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Brazil Suspends Foreign Debt Payments</h3>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - Since the coup in Brazil on the 10th of this month, President Vargas issued a statement saying that he would temporarily suspend the payment of foreign debt interest and principal in order to improve the country's economic organization. The government has now followed this statement and decided to suspend the payment of foreign debt interest and principal from today. It has also authorized the Minister of Finance to start negotiations with the countries concerned to formulate new agreements in accordance with Brazil's financial resources. However, this will not affect commercial debts. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<h3>The Issue of the Albanian Emperor's Status</h3>
<p>Depends on the Judgment of the British Court</p>
<p>[London] According to the "Sunday Dispatch," whether the Ethiopian Emperor Selassie I still retains the status of Emperor of Albania will be determined by the British High Court. Two years ago, an American consortium and the Abyssinian government conducted negotiations. The American bank provided loans to the Albanian government to operate the country's mining industry. As a result of the negotiations, the bank opened by American Jew Geldock released 25,000 pounds to the Albanian Emperor Selassie. In addition, Geldock purchased approximately 15,000 square miles of mining rights in Albania in 1935 for a price of 1 million pounds. Later, Italy occupied Albanian territory. In order to avoid causing international disputes, Geldock abandoned the above-mentioned mining plan and filed a lawsuit with the British court, demanding compensation for losses from the Albanian Emperor. Therefore, the Albanian Emperor either refused to appear in court and accepted a default judgment, or he had to turn himself in and appear in court in person. However, according to British law, foreign monarchs enjoy privileges and cannot be prosecuted by the court. However, whether the current status of the Albanian Emperor is still a foreign monarch is now awaiting a ruling by the British High Court. (Central News Agency, Havana, 21st)</p>

Cobham and others arrived at Croydon Airport here at 3:23 pm yesterday. After departing from Cairo, they encountered high-speed storms over the Mediterranean, but were finally able to reach London directly without stopping in between. This flight round trip took only five days, seventeen hours, and twenty-seven minutes, breaking the previous record of seven days, twenty-two minutes, and forty-two seconds set by Amy Johnson. The actual round-trip flight time was only seventy-seven hours and forty-eight minutes. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic and Overseas Chinese Circles Discuss Poland's Attitude Towards China</h3>
<p>Always Maintaining Friendly Relations　Absolutely No Opposition to China in Any Way</p>
<p>A certain gentleman in diplomatic circles, who has resided in Poland for many years, recently returned from overseas and spoke in detail about the political situation in Poland. First, he discussed Poland's attitude towards the League of Nations in Geneva, believing that all issues raised in the League of Nations Assembly should be discussed by all members of the League, and should absolutely not be discussed by a small number of powerful countries or organizations outside the League. Poland believes that these meetings of a small number of powerful countries may be able to resolve disputes, but whether the resolutions made by these few powerful countries can be observed by all members of the League is a very big question. Because the strategy adopted by the League of Nations is different from Poland's views, the Polish representative finds it difficult to vote in favor. As for the Polish representative not advocating the use of the word "aggression" in the League of Nations Assembly, it was based on the failure of the previous vote. If the word "aggression" is adopted, the next step will be "sanctions." In fact, since sanctions are difficult to succeed, it is better to use other methods. Otherwise, if sanctions fail again, the collective security system of the League of Nations will collapse, so it must be treated with caution. Therefore, the Polish representative's move was for the sake of the future of the League of Nations, and there was absolutely no intention to oppose China. Therefore, in the meeting, the Polish representative only abstained from voting, and did not vote against it. The gentleman further said that the Polish government has repeatedly explained that it expresses sympathy and goodwill towards China and has no malice. For example, in previous League of Nations meetings, the Polish representative had repeatedly supported China's proposals, such as those concerning international labor issues and the anti-smoking issue. In addition, the League of Nations Technical Cooperation Committee for China sent the head of the health team, a Polish man named Raczyman, to China to assist the Chinese government in planning, reorganizing the port quarantine system, and establishing a national health design office. Okinski, a Polish Warsaw engineering consultant, was also appointed as the League of Nations Transport Group's representative in China. Mr. Okinski made great contributions to the construction of Chinese highways. Polish missionaries in China often provide great assistance to poor Chinese people. Bishop Palaci of Poland, who recently came to China, donated more than 1,000 Polish zlotys to the victims of the Sichuan disaster. Last year, in order to promote Sino-Polish cultural relations, the Polish Ministry of Education donated a scholarship for two years, totaling three to four thousand Polish zlotys, to Chinese students studying in Poland. Moreover, Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, has repeatedly stated that Poland will not join the Anti-Communist Pact. All of these are sufficient to prove that China and Poland have very friendly relations. Moreover, both China and Poland are countries struggling in adversity, and they should express sympathy to each other, and so on. The above are all facts. According to his observation, Poland's attitude towards China has always maintained friendly relations, but it is unlikely that there will be any ill will at this time. It can also be asserted.</p>
<h3>Mine Collapse in Gunma Prefecture, Japan</h3>
<p>Seven Hundred People Buried Alive　Sulfur Warehouses Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reports that at 3:40 PM on the 11th, in Tsumagoi Village, Agatsuma County, Gunma Prefecture, near the border of Nagano Prefecture, a sudden landslide occurred at the Mikogushi Mine of the Hokkaido Sulfur Company (Mitsui affiliate). About 1,300 people living in the area and related to the mine, of whom six to seven hundred were completely buried alive in the mine. Nearby houses were also shaken and collapsed. At the same time, a fire broke out in the mountain dwellings, and all the sulfur warehouses were completely destroyed by the fire. Cries for help could be heard for miles. In addition, due to three inches of accumulated snow, the cries of hunger and cold were unbearable to witness. On the same day, the supervisor of the Tokyo Mining Supervision Bureau happened to be inspecting the mine on official business, and there is fear there is no hope for his survival. The Tokyo Ministry of Commerce and Industry urgently dispatched Supervisor Konishi to the scene to investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>German General Ludendorff Ill</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Ludendorff, a famous German general during the European War, recently fell ill and underwent surgery. The progress is satisfactory. However, Ludendorff is a figure of great interest to the German people, and his illness has once again become a topic of conversation regarding his relationship with the Third Reich. It is said that there is a reason why General Ludendorff has clashed with the National Socialist government. The General and his wife founded the German Theosophical Society, which has hundreds of thousands of followers and is very powerful. This new and different religion does not entirely accept National Socialism. Furthermore, recent German school textbooks record the first National Socialist uprising in Munich on November 9, 1923, but do not mention the merits established by Ludendorff at that time. Ludendorff specifically protested this matter. In addition, a type of letter has recently been discovered in various parts of Germany, secretly distributed everywhere. The contents severely criticized the policies of Führer Hitler, especially his foreign policy, stating, "Spain and the Soviet Union should not become the targets of German foreign policy, and even less so Italy." Finally, it was said, "Long live freedom!" This secret letter is rumored to have been written by General Ludendorff. After Ludendorff protested, the police authorities declared that the letter was forged. It can be seen from these various things that General Ludendorff and the National Socialist government are not entirely in harmony. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Adventures in Pudong</h3>
<p>— Fang Shu</p>
<p>From Nan Gaoqiao to Bei Gaoqiao</p>
<p>The author crossed to Pudong on September 25th and stayed there for more than fifty days in total, traveling all over the three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha, and learned about the local people's characteristics. Now, I will record the general outline of my adventurous experiences as I remember them:</p>
<p>On the gloomy morning of December 7th, three enemy planes began bombing Fengcheng in Fengxian County, without stopping for a moment from morning to night. At this time, the so-called Special Operations Team began its work of saving the country. (Temporarily serving as rescue and burial). On the morning of the first day (8th), six enemy planes soared over Fengcheng, bombing alternately. In the afternoon, they switched to artillery, and every minute, the sound of "whoosh... boom" continued incessantly. Around 6:00 PM that night, the sound of artillery subsided for a short time, and then a grinding sound approached. With a bang, the people of Nan Gaoqiao were scattered in shock. After investigation, the Japanese army bombed three kitchens of the Catholic Church again, slightly injuring two old people. Our garrison was less than a mile away from Fengcheng, so to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, we moved to Liangdian. That night, we could see shameless traitors releasing various different signals. On the 11th, we returned to Taizhen. That night, the sentries caught two verified traitors. They had firecrackers for releasing signals, white silk and small copper counterfeit coins in their pockets. Not only did he admit to being a traitor himself, but he also confessed his leader. People were immediately sent to arrest him, hoping to wipe them out in one fell swoop, but he had already received the news and escaped without a trace. As a result, his confidant was caught. After three trials, he admitted to the traitorous acts without hesitation. So, at about 1:00 AM on the 12th, three gunshots were fired, ending the lives of the three traitors.</p>
<p>On the 13th, we arrived at Xinchang. Just as we were having breakfast, the Xinchang Militia Team in the town came into contact with the Special Operations Team, fighting for about two hours and killing two traitors. At this time, our companions were scattered, leaving only me and Tao. That night, we stayed in Nanhui City.</p>
<p>On the 14th, a few more companions joined us temporarily. Tao and I walked for five days, sleeping in the rice straw, eating raw sweet potatoes. Everyone felt weak in their hands and feet and could not move forward, so we hired two small boats. Small boats are the best means of transportation in Pudong. When the boat arrived at Sifantuan, the so-called Militia Team, under the guise of inspection, actually took advantage of the fire to loot. They sent our twelve companions in distress from the boat to the town office. They all said in unison that we were traitors and could not be released. Later, after repeated explanations from me, Tao, and Hua, we were released. We were very grateful to a Mr. Zhou at the time, because he released us and also asked a guide to accompany us to Zhujiaqiao. However, a traitor is a traitor after all, with a heart as poisonous as ink. Just as we were approaching Zhujiaqiao, gunshots rang out. At the time, we were all confused, so we still moved forward. Later, the gunshots became more and more dense, and a wave of shouts of killing rushed towards us. We then realized the intention of the gunshots, and all scattered and lay down. I crossed the fields, jumped over the river, and lay on the sleepers in the middle of the railroad tracks, using the locomotive as cover. The bullets of the traitors flew over my head seven or eight times. I forgot about life and death and was very calm. But what was painful was not dying at the hands of the real enemy, but at the hands of traitors acting as accomplices. Later, they tied our hands behind our backs with grass ropes, searched our entire bodies, and plundered all our meager possessions, and locked us in three desolate empty houses. We sat in a semi-circular form on the brick floor, which was hard and cold. Looking around, it was full of guard posts, simply treating us like robbers. About an hour later, a young military officer in a Zhongshan suit came. Our twelve companions sized him up and then he left. We were not afraid at all and prepared to die. It turned out that this young military officer was the Security Team. Not long after, Zhang and Li said to us, "Because you are all related to ×××, we will let you go back." Of course, we were extraordinarily happy to gain hope of life in the midst of the despair of death. At 4:00 PM, we took a small train from Zhujiaqiao to Xinlu, and rushed to Bei Gaoqiao overnight. On the morning of the 15th, an Italian merchant ship sent our twelve companions, who had narrowly escaped death, to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Finally, I must explain that there are no real enemies in Pudong. Even if there are, they only land along the Huangpu River and leave, and do not stay. The so-called Japanese people in a certain place and Japanese people in a certain place are all rumors spread by traitors.</p>

<h3>The Jiaying Steamer Loaded with Tribute Rice to Help Civilian Food Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Registration of Rice Shops and Payment Procedures Need to be Completed Urgently　Unloading Begins This Morning and Can Be Sold on the Market This Afternoon</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Public Concession Board and the South China Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase foreign rice to regulate the food supply for Shanghai citizens, the first batch of Saigon rice, loaded on the British Taikoo Company's Xi Ying steamer, was imported at 1:20 PM yesterday. At 4:30 PM, it docked on the Huangpu River in front of the Taikoo Company in the French Concession. The total number was 25,000 bags, with 20,000 bags distributed to various rice shops for retail and 5,000 bags used for refugee relief. The Rice Shop Association has completed the payment procedures for 500 member rice shops and is allowed to start unloading this morning. The association will distribute 40 bags to each rice shop, and it will no longer be stored in warehouses. Because the foreign rice has been specially approved by our government to be exempt from import duties, the unloading procedures are very simple. It is scheduled that from this afternoon, 500 rice shops in the two concessions can sell it at a fair price, and the price per catty has been reduced to 8.5 cents. The second and third batches of rice that have been reordered will also be shipped to Shanghai by the end of this month. In addition, Siamese rice directly ordered from the Hengfeng Rice Mill in Siam by Lai Shang, totaling more than 2,500 bags, is expected to arrive in Shanghai for delivery around the 28th of this month. In addition, the Shanghai Rice Shop Association held an emergency meeting yesterday, attended by Zhang Nianxuan, Huang Rufeng, Gu Yuqing, Hu Xiangang, Xia Tongfu, Su Boxun, Xu Zhenyue, etc. First, Chairman Zhang Nianxuan proposed that rescue and retail matters are currently being handled. The allocation of rice for retail in the Public Concession and the French Concession has been implemented in order. However, there are a large number of refugees in the Nanshi refugee area, and there are still households living there. Whether this method is also applicable will be discussed with the authorities. If permission is granted, it is also planned to establish a system to popularize it. Finally, the committee members discussed various proper methods for the allocation of retail, and then dispersed. Of the 500 registered rice shops, more than 400 have completed the payment and rice collection procedures. There are still more than 30 that have not completed it. It is heard that the association has notified the more than 30 stores to go to the association to collect the application forms before 9:00 AM on the 22nd (today) and go to the Bank of China at 276 Sichuan Road to pay off the payment so that the shipment can be unloaded and distributed to the stores as soon as it arrives. It is also heard that the Bank of China's collection time is limited to 11:00 AM on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Resuming Navigation to Shanghai and Hong Kong One After Another</h3>
<p>Wharf Damage Makes Stopping Difficult　Regular Postal Ships Not Fully Opened　A Total of Seven Lines Have Been Scheduled to Open</p>
<p>The foreign shipping companies in Shanghai, due to the outbreak of the Songhu War, most of the sailors on the ships were unwilling to risk going to Shanghai. If they sailed to Wusong, the crew and sailors had to ask the ship owners to increase their wages three times. As a result, the foreign merchant ships stopped sailing to Shanghai one after another. Recently, with the war front moving west, a large fleet of enemy ships outside the Wusongkou, led by the Nagato and Asahi ships, have successively opened to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. More than 70 ships have sailed in, roughly attempting to break through our Jiangyin blockade line and conspiring to attack Nanjing by land and water. The Wusongkou is becoming quiet. Therefore, the British and German foreign shipping companies are planning to resume the Shanghai route. In recent days, the British Company's Sudan ship, Jardine Matheson's Green ship, Blue Funnel Line's passenger ship Sarpedon, Jardine Matheson's Tai Yin ship, and North German Company's Saar ship have all arrived in Shanghai one after another. Currently, the foreign ships that have already opened to navigation in Shanghai include: ㊀ French postal ship on the Sino-French line, one ship every two weeks; ㊁ Italian postal ship on the Sino-Italian line, one ship every four weeks; ㊂ British Company cargo ship on the Sino-European line, one ship every four weeks; ㊃ Blue Funnel Line passenger and cargo ships on the Sino-European line, each sailing once a month; ㊄ Jardine Matheson's Green ship on the Sino-European line, sailing once a month; ㊅ British ship on the Sino-Australian line, sailing once a month; ㊆ Tianxiang ship on the Sino-American New York line, sailing once a month. As for the ships that have not yet resumed service, there are the Pacific Shipping Company's President Dollar, Changxing Imperial Ship, and British regular postal ship, and North German's express ship. The reason why they have not resumed navigation is not because of fear of war, but because the major wharves and warehouses from Yangshupu to Waibaidu Bridge were destroyed in the war and are currently temporarily controlled by the enemy, making it difficult to dock for a while. (In the past, most of the postal ships docked at China Merchants Bureau's Zhongzhan, Beizhan, and Gonghexiang wharves, but now they have all been destroyed. Dalae's Nichiren Kyodo wharf is still unable to berth large ships.) Therefore, the resumption of regular postal ships still has to wait. It is heard that Changxing's Fu Hou ship plans to come to Shanghai in January next year. The President Dollar ship has not yet had news of opening to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The German Ping Steamer Stopped Sailing to Tongzhou and Will Open to Ningbo Today</h3>
<p>Ningbo Replied Electrically to Approve the Resumption of Navigation　Passengers Going to Tongzhou Changed to Taking Ende</p>
<p>The German Ping steamer of the Italian merchant China-Italy Company, because the military authorities in Ningbo have responded to the request of the Ningbo fellow villagers association in Shanghai and approved the resumption of the German Ping steamer, so as to facilitate the travel of travelers. Therefore, the proposal to sail to Tongzhou has been cancelled, and it will open to Yong on the 22nd, as follows:</p>
<p>Current Status of the Zhenhai Blockade</p>
<p>Since the interruption of land transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang, it has been maintained by the waterway between Shanghai and Ningbo with difficulty. Therefore, the continuation of this line is not only convenient for the people of Yong, but also for the people of Yong. However, since Zhenhai Coast was shelled by enemy ships on the 5th of this month, and Ningbo was wantonly bombed by enemy planes on the 12th, the local military authorities have increased fortifications in the already blockaded Zhenhai Estuary, and the traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo has also been interrupted. The German Ping steamer has been stranded in Shanghai again and again and cannot open.</p>
<p>Original Text of Ningbo's Reply</p>
<p>The Ningbo fellow villagers association in Shanghai, in view of the obstructed traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang, the Shanghai-Ningbo route relies on the Ningbo authorities' efforts to maintain it, so as to ensure the safety of travelers. At the same time, fellow villagers from Yong residing in Shanghai have also asked the association to forward a letter to the Yong authorities to change the handling. After the association repeatedly telegraphed the responsible parties in Ningbo, it was only yesterday that it received a reply from Ningbo, saying that it had discussed it with Commander Wang, County Chief Chen, and Police Chief Yu, and agreed to resume it three days later. After receiving the telegram, the association immediately notified the China-Italy Company.</p>
<p>German Ping Opens to Yong Today</p>
<p>After receiving the news, the company originally scheduled the German Ping steamer to be diverted to Tongzhou yesterday (21st). After deliberation, it was decided that the company had already dispatched the Ende steamer on the Tongzhou line. At the same time, a large number of passengers who had purchased tickets to Yong did not want to refund them. Therefore, it was decided to cancel the proposal to divert to Tongzhou and advance the German Ping steamer from Shanghai to Yong on the 22nd. The official announcement is as follows: "The German Ping steamer will depart from the Jinliyuan Wharf at 3:00 PM on Monday, November 22nd, to Ningbo." As for those who have purchased tickets to Tongzhou yesterday, they will be transferred to the next Ende steamer to Tongzhou.</p>
<h3>Fire in Nanshi Still Raging</h3>
<p>Fear of Spreading to the Refugee Area</p>
<p>The fire in Nanshi reignited again at 1:00 PM on the 21st, causing flames to fill the sky and spread in all directions within the area, burning for several days and nights. According to reporter investigation, the houses burned in Nanshi District in the past few days include those in Laoximen, Dadongmen, Linyin Road, Daji Road, Dananmen, Xiaodongmen, Gaochang Temple, Wenmiao Road, and more than ten places in Dalin Road. In addition, the fire on Zhonghua Road and near the police station is even more intense. As of last night, it was still spreading. If no measures are taken to extinguish it, it will inevitably spread to the houses in the refugee area.</p>
<h3>Gunshots at Midnight</h3>
<p>No One Injured　But the Source of the Gunshots is Unknown</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that a few minutes before midnight yesterday (20th), rifle shots were heard in the central area of the Public Concession. After investigation, it was learned that similar gunshots had been heard on Edward Road or near the southern part of the central area in the past few nights. However, according to the investigators, no one was injured. As for who fired the shots and why, it is still a mystery.</p>
<h3>Continued Fundraising for National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Kui Yanfang Raised More Than 20,000　National Medical Association Reached 30,000</p>
<p>Since the Second Special District Group of the Shanghai Citizen Fundraising Team for National Salvation Bonds started fundraising, thanks to the efforts of the team leaders, the results have been quite impressive. Recently, Mr. Kui Yanfang, the deputy director of the group, raised another 25,000 yuan. Other team members also reported many achievements. It is heard that the group is still continuing to carry out fundraising work. Since the National Medical Association established a National Salvation Bonds fundraising team, it has been actively carrying out fundraising work. Until recently, the amount of subscriptions from its members has reached more than 30,000 yuan. In order to step up the promotion, the association has now expanded the fundraising to fulfill its duties. In addition, the association had previously handled the registration and certification of national doctors with the Health Bureau, which has now been suspended.</p>
<h3>Losses of Factories in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Totaling More Than 800 Million Yuan　Nanshi District Not Yet Included</p>
<p>The New Voice Agency reported that after the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry to investigate the losses of destroyed factories in Shanghai in detail and estimate the amount, in addition to announcing the deadline for the destroyed factories to report, it also telegraphed the estimated losses of the destroyed factories. The New Voice Agency reporter learned from the bureau yesterday that the Ministry of Industry was telegraphed at that time that there were 2,998 destroyed factories, with losses of 564,535,297 yuan. The total number of factories, according to statistics before the war, was 5,255. The estimated losses were 30% in Nanshi, 100% in Zhabei, 70% in Special District 1, and 50% in the four suburbs. Special District 2 had none. When the report was submitted, our army had not yet withdrawn from Nanshi, and most of the factories in the district were intact. Now that Nanshi has become a war zone, and the factories at Rihui Bridge and Gaochang Temple, where factories are lined up, have all become scorched earth, it should be calculated at 100% according to the current estimate. Moreover, there are 2,272 factories in the district, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total amount. Therefore, the estimated losses of factories in Shanghai should be more than 800 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government for Fuel Assistance</h3>
<p>Shortage of Charcoal　Must Rely on Assistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, for the purpose of relieving the Shanghai fuel situation, telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, saying, "To the Hangzhou Zhejiang Provincial Government: Shanghai is extremely short of charcoal and must rely on Zhejiang Province for assistance. There are now firewood and charcoal firms such as Maoxing, Xieshunxiang, Xincheng, Sentai, Lianda, and Chitae, who plan to ask Wenzhou charcoal merchants to transport and assist. We hope that your government will telegraph the Yongjia County Government to allow it to pass as usual, so as to maintain the fuel supply in Shanghai. We look forward to your reply. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully."</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Rise Due to Urgent Need</h3>
<p>500,000 Bags Still in Stock　Price Up 10 Cents from Last Week</p>
<p>Since the sudden change in the situation in Shanghai, food and fuel, as daily necessities for the people, have been cut off at the source, and supply and demand have not been met. Although the concession authorities have tried their best to find a way, the panic has not been reduced slightly. There are restrictions on the purchase of rice, so citizens have switched to buying flour to satisfy their hunger. In the past half month, the flour on the market has been gradually sold. According to current statistics, there are still 500,000 bags in stock, and the price is 4 yuan and 15 cents per bag, which is 10 cents higher than a week ago.</p>
<h3>Nan Cheng Da Secretly Hiding Rice Confiscated</h3>
<p>On the One Hand, Showing a Slight Punishment　On the Other Hand, Helping Refugees</p>
<p>After the Nanshi Defense Army was ordered to move west, the food supply in the concession suddenly became scarce, and the poor were panic-stricken. Thousands of people stood at the gates of various rice shops, but they could not get even a liter or a pint of rice to take home. Who would not be saddened by this situation? Who knew that there were still a few profiteering merchants who secretly hid and sold white rice at high prices, creating shortages. A few days ago, Nan Cheng Da Rice Shop at the intersection of Niaolang Road in the French Concession hid dozens of bags of white rice and did not sell it. Whenever poor residents went to buy rice, they would sell a large batch of broken rice that they had accumulated at ordinary times on the market. It is heard that it was sold for 8 yuan per dan, but there were many bad grains in this broken rice, so it could only be used to cook porridge and could not be used to cook rice. As a result, those who bought broken rice complained incessantly. This matter was discovered by the Lu Jia Wan Chief Patrol Room, which sent investigators to investigate. More than ten bags of white rice were found in the rice shop and taken back to the patrol room. The patrol head thought that this matter was greatly related to public order, so he specially used the rice as food for the relief of refugees, showing a slight punishment. The general poor people all praised it.</p>
<h3>Dr. Niu Huilin's Funeral Today</h3>
<p>Following Christian Rites　Held at 3:00 PM</p>
<p>After the death of Dr. Niu Huilin, celebrities from China and abroad expressed their condolences and offered funeral gifts. His wife, Ms. Niu Liu Yiji, led her sons and daughters, Enan, Enjian, Ende, and Enmei, to accompany the spirit and grieve as much as possible. Niu's remains, surrounded by wreaths, had been made up by a technician from the International Funeral Home. Although his face was lifelike, the famous doctor of a generation had become a historical figure. His wife and children cried and could not bear to look at him. The coffin and other items were simple in accordance with his will. All ceremonies followed Christian rules. At 2:00 PM today, a pastor will lead a funeral service in front of the coffin. The funeral will be held at 3:00 PM. Niu had extensive social connections in China and abroad during his lifetime, and there must be many relatives and friends holding the ropes at that time. The Public Concession has specially issued a permit allowing passage through the roads he passed, but there are no traditional customs such as ceremonial guards and roadside sacrifices. According to those who know the Niu family well, the Niu family has suffered repeated misfortunes and their assets have been exhausted. The famous and reputable doctor died in poverty, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<h3>High Tides in the Huangpu River for Several Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>Unprecedented in Winter　Tide Was the Greatest on the 19th</p>
<p>High tides in the Huangpu River are usually the worst in autumn, and lower in winter than in autumn. Unexpectedly, this year it has suddenly changed. Now it is the lunar October season, and the tides have been rising for several consecutive days, even exceeding the amount in autumn. Especially the tide on the afternoon of the 19th reached more than 13 feet, causing many riverbanks to be flooded. The warehouses were also caught off guard due to the unexpected event, and the goods were soaked in water. The sugar bags piled up on the ground floor of the Wylie &amp; Han Company's warehouse at 53 Sima Road have been obviously affected by the water, so the company has notified the cargo owners to go to inspect and retrieve them.</p>
<h3>British Fleet Commander Rear-Admiral Little Still Remains in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Flagship Kent to Sail to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Regarding the report yesterday that Vice-Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, had left Shanghai aboard the flagship HMS Kent, it has now been learned that the ship sailed to Hong Kong, but Vice-Admiral Little remains in Shanghai and did not go to Hong Kong on the ship. Reliable sources now indicate that four hundred infantrymen of the "Durham Light Infantry," dispatched by the British to Shanghai for relief duty, have been transported by British warship to Hong Kong for transfer to Shanghai, and are expected to arrive in port in approximately two to three days.</p>
<h3>Western Missionary Mr. Bergson Reports on the Situation in North China</h3>
<p>The local YMCA, to facilitate the exchange of information, strengthen bonds, and deepen understanding of current affairs and global trends, initiated a weekly luncheon gathering. Since its inception, it has attracted a considerable number of participants. Taking advantage of the presence of Western missionary Mr. Bergson, it has been decided to hold a gathering at 12:30 pm next week on the 23rd, at which Mr. Bergson will report on "The Current Situation in North China," so that all may understand the latest conditions in the north.</p>
<h3>Shuanglin Natives' Symposium</h3>
<p>Shuanglin natives residing in Shanghai, including Cai Renbao, Chen Xingzhen, Wang Yangzhen, and Shen Xiongbo, noting the lack of news from their hometown, convened a symposium of Shuanglin natives at Dajin Road yesterday afternoon. Over a hundred natives attended. They resolved to publish a notice seeking accurate news from their hometown and inquiring about routes for refugees coming to Shanghai. They also sought the names, ages, occupations, and current contact information of natives residing in Shanghai returning to their hometown. The association is willing to provide assistance to natives seeking refuge in Shanghai. The association is also in contact with various radio stations to broadcast the latest news for the purpose of disseminating information. The association's temporary contact address is c/o Shen Rubai, 256 Tianjin Road, telephone number 94000. Special telephone numbers are 34850 and 93197. Anyone with news of Shuanglin is welcome to report it.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Explains the Nature of Soybean from Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously had doubts regarding the issuance of certificates for soybeans and soybean oil from the three eastern provinces, and telegraphed the Ministry of Industry for clarification. On the 19th of this month, they received a reply from the Ministry of Industry stating: "Your telegram received. Soybeans and soybean oil, etc., produced in the eastern provinces and imported through various ports, which are only subject to transit duties, should naturally not be considered foreign goods. Please be informed." Ministry of Industry Seal.</p>
<h3>Over Thirty Customs Vessels on the Huangpu River Were All Seized Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Water Police Department of the Jianghai Customs and the Dredging Bureau's Smuggling Patrol Boats and Fireboats Were All Seized</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Over thirty large and small customs vessels belonging to the Jianghai Customs, the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau, and the Water Police Department, docked south of the Jianghai Customs wharf on Bund, Hankow Road, were all seized by enemy forces yesterday. Upon hearing the news, Customs Commissioner R.L. Forster immediately lodged a protest with the Japanese side. According to reporters, seventy to eighty enemy sailors, aboard several speedboats, arrived at the location at 2:30 PM, and after mooring, armed, boarded each vessel, monitoring all crew members and forbidding them from leaving. At the time, the crew members were caught off guard, so apart from a few who took the opportunity to escape, most were detained on board. The enemy soldiers then hoisted the rising sun flag on each vessel and ordered them to raise steam and set sail. By evening, most had sailed away. Apart from a few docked next to the enemy warship "Izumo," the majority were docked at Wayside Wharf. Only the Haiguang and Liuxing remained at the original location, unable to sail away. After the incident, reporters went to investigate and saw enemy soldiers standing armed on the ships. The situation was quite tense, causing pedestrians to disappear from the streets. Only crew members who had escaped could be seen hurrying back and forth. The seized customs vessels and small boats are all vessels used for smuggling patrol on the Huangpu River. Among them, Puji and another vessel were the only fireboats in the Huangpu River and were also seized. If a fire breaks out in the Huangpu River in the future, it will be impossible to put it out, so its impact on international safety is particularly significant. After these two seizures, all of the Jianghai Customs vessels have been taken, making it difficult to carry out its work. With the disappearance of patrol boats on the Huangpu River, pirates will run rampant without any security.</p>

<h3>300,000 Refugees Weeping from Hunger and Cold, Like Living in Hell</h3>
<p>Fuel and Supplies Are Exhausted, Urgently Awaiting Donations from All Sectors, 100 Refugees Sent to Tongzhou</p>
<p>Because of the continuous rainy days in the city, the weather has suddenly turned cold. Reporters visited the heads of various relief organizations yesterday morning and learned that the city's 300,000 refugees are all trapped in hunger and cold. Only about 50% of the poor refugees have received clothing and bedding, and food supplies have been exhausted due to the changing situation in Shanghai and the lack of assistance. Therefore, most refugees in the shelters are weeping from hunger and cold, like living in hell. Although a batch of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai, it has not yet been distributed. At this difficult time, various relief organizations are imploring people from all walks of life to extend their compassion, generously donate, and enthusiastically contribute to save these disaster victims. According to the International Relief Committee, the refugee area in the Nanshi area urgently needs donations of temporary food items such as guangbing (crisp pancakes), steamed buns, bread, and large flatbreads. If there are large donations, please contact the committee in advance. In addition, items such as cotton quilts, clothing, fuel, mast lights, canvas beds, toilet paper, large public buckets, chamber pots, and sanitary medicines are also in great need. Please send these donations to the committee on the third floor of the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge or to the committee's third shelter at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Luson. Also, yesterday morning, when reporters went to the United Relief Association of Charity and Youth Groups, all the staff were busy moving cotton clothes to the shelters. However, according to the person in charge, they are struggling to distribute the cotton quilts and clothes, and the amount is still large. At the same time, fuel and food are also facing difficulties. They hope that all sectors will provide assistance quickly, or the association can purchase them at a price.</p>
<p>Difficulties with Supplies, Striving to Disperse</p>
<p>Due to the changing war situation, traffic between Shanghai and the mainland has been disrupted, making dispersal work more difficult. Although refugees in Shanghai have been continuously sent away, there are still 300,000 people. The issue of supplies will inevitably arise, and appropriate methods are being discussed to resolve it. At the same time, foreign shipping companies are being commissioned to arrange for repatriation. It has been learned that the Shanghai Charity Relief Association sent 100-odd people yesterday, who were transported to Tongzhou by the TaiKoo company's Wuxue ship, and then transferred to various places.</p>
<p>Soliciting Winter Clothing to Aid Refugees</p>
<p>The weather has turned cold in recent days, and most refugees still lack winter clothing, suffering from both cold and hunger, a pitiful situation. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate cotton clothing and bedding to be distributed to the refugees. Items can be delivered to the YMCA International Relief Association for collection.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Refugees Still Awaiting Rescue</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jiangxi Compatriot Friendship Association has requested the Jiangxi Compatriot Association to continue repatriating and rescuing the many fellow refugees stranded in Shanghai. Their letter states: "Your association's repatriation work has been over for a long time, but there are still many fellow refugees stranded in Shanghai. We would like to request your association to quickly continue the rescue efforts from the remaining funds allocated by the provincial government to alleviate the suffering of fellow refugees who are displaced and homeless."</p>
<h3>Sheltering Lane Refugees</h3>
<p>Reaching 1,000 People, Continuing to Issue Supply Tickets</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Relief Association, noting that there are still many refugees from the French Concession wandering the streets and alleys, and that the continuous rainy days have left the refugees like chickens in a soup, in a miserable state that cannot be described, and that they are prone to infectious diseases, which is also a major obstacle to hygiene, the association's deputy director of the shelter group, Lu Deshen, led all the staff to go to various roads to shelter and transport refugees to various shelters for the past two days, reaching more than two thousand people. However, they feel that the days ahead are long, and the number of refugees is increasing sharply, making supplies difficult. They hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate to save those who are in dire straits.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Xilianyi Association received donations from all walks of life yesterday, including 8,300 large pancakes and steamed buns from colleagues at Shenxin No. 9 Factory, 3,100 from Mr. Tong, 2,800 from Mr. Liu Yongxu, 1,000 from Ruida Lumber Company, and 71 pieces of old clothes and shoes from Mr. Xian. Mr. Sun of the Fu Hua Silk Weaving Factory donated 10 cotton wadding rolls. After the association distributed them, they were distributed to refugees in various districts. The association's relief group issued supply tickets to civilians, entirely for the convenience of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. Refugees can use the tickets to collect 1 food item from the association. Currently, each ticket is temporarily worth 2 jiao (cents) in national currency for food. If people from all walks of life donate food and send it to the association to exchange for supply tickets, they can distribute them themselves. The association will issue official receipts for all items received, but will never send staff to solicit donations outside. For those who entrust the association to help refugees, please contact them by phone at 25627, or send donations to the association at Chengde Fang, Gordon Road.</p>
<h3>The Local Police Bureau Officially Ordered to Close</h3>
<p>The local police bureau has been ordered to close, and all police officers are being dismissed with severance pay. Yesterday, a special notice was sent to all branch bureaus, stations, and teams stating: "This bureau has been ordered to close. All salaries for officers and police in October have been received and distributed by the chiefs of each branch bureau, station, and team. However, the long-term police savings have not yet been issued. Except for the police corps, which will be responsible for issuing them themselves, each branch bureau, station, and team is instructed to create a roster of the current number of personnel and submit it for verification by the 25th. Once the government order is received, it will be published in the newspaper for comparison with photographs and returned. At the same time, all expenses before October for each branch bureau, station, and team should be quickly transferred to clear procedures. This is a special notice."</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Refugees Managed by the Salvation Army</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports: Jiaotong University in Xujiahui is sheltering 15,500 refugees and has been maintained by the Municipal Council. However, due to the Municipal Council's recent busy schedule, it has transferred the management of the site to the Salvation Army on Friday of last week. The Salvation Army has been working tirelessly on various tasks for three months since the start of the Sino-Japanese War. Now that it has taken on this heavy task, its enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable. Since taking over the site, the army has greatly improved the affairs within the site, and the refugees are quite happy to be in it. Many refugees are very frightened because they did not bring cotton clothes with them and winter is approaching. Fortunately, the Straits Settlements Chinese have donated 300,000 pieces of clothing, which have been allocated to the army by the International Red Cross for distribution to refugees in various shelters. Each refugee in the shelter will receive five pieces of clothing, which will be enough to keep them warm.</p>

<h3>The First Special District Federation of Shanghai Established a Refugee Relief Association Yesterday</h3>
<p>Arousing City Rulers to Cooperatively Rescue Disaster Victims, Electing Lin Kanghou and Others as Committee Members</p>
<p>The First Special District Federation of Shanghai noted that the relief of more than 300,000 refugees in the city is extremely urgent.

Please negotiate to open the water supply first to maintain the citizens' livelihoods. It was resolved to send a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association and separate letters to the landlords to negotiate. ㊄ The Kunchou district branches of the association are located in the war zone, and the seals and documents of each branch may have been lost. How should the fraud be prevented? It was resolved that: A.

<h3>Recent News on the Pudong Compatriot Association's Relief Efforts for Compatriots</h3>
<p>No Preparation for Ferrying Passengers</p>
<p>Since the sudden change in the situation in Shanghai, the residents of Pudong have been coming to Shanghai one after another to seek refuge, supporting the old and carrying the young, in a very miserable state. The Pudong Compatriot Association in Shanghai, for the purpose of helping the compatriots, immediately handled the shelter matters, either by arranging for them to be housed in leased houses, or by transferring them to various shelters of the Municipal Relief Association, numbering more than ten thousand people. The number of people coming to the association to request registration for shelter has been constant in recent days. Since the opening of the ferries between the ports of Gaoqiao and Donggou in Pudong and this city, the association has also sent staff to take care of the passengers, who have all praised the convenience. As for the rumor that the association is running its own ferries to transport passengers, after inquiring, there is no such fact and it is a misrepresentation.</p>

<h3>Pushan Villa Burial Work</h3>
<p>More Than 17,000 Male and Female Corpses, Change of Burial Ground Due to the Change in Shanghai's War Situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pushan Villa has been handling funerals for many years and has achieved remarkable results. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War this year, the burial work has become more and more burdensome. All the soldiers and civilians who died in the British and French Concessions, Nanshi, Huxi, Hongkou, and the war zone were sent by the villa to send burial teams to collect and bury them. It is estimated that from August 13 to November 15, a total of 1,238 officers and soldiers, 142 refugees, and 23 children who sacrificed their lives in the Red Cross's various rescue hospitals and special hospitals were buried. The Shanghai Relief Committee's various shelters and hospitals, a total of 151, collected a total of 310 refugees and 696 children's corpses. The United Relief Association of Charity Groups collected a total of 52 shelters and hospitals, collecting a total of 401 refugees and 794 children's corpses. The World Red Swastika Society collected 60 refugees and 94 children's corpses from various shelters and hospitals. The International Relief Association collected 41 refugees and 64 children's corpses from various hospitals and shelters. Renji, Jiren, Tongren, Shilong, Zhongde, Detong, Nan, Women and Children Labor, Huilv, Railway, Siming, Shanghai Plague, Tuberculosis Sanatorium, Children's, Shi Enxianglin, and Andang each hospital collected a total of 304 refugees and 107 children's corpses. Ningbo, Guangdong, Hebei, Tai, Jia, and Shi each association collected a total of 106 refugees and 111 children's corpses. Pingjiang, Jiangyin, Jiangning, and Xijin each public office collected a total of 21 refugees and 129 children's corpses. Renji, Lianyi, Chinese Jisheng Association, Yellow Swastika Society, Blue Cross, and Chinese Moral Association each charity group collected a total of 37 refugees and 90 children's corpses. Other shelters collected a total of 114 refugees and 18 children's corpses. The Municipal Police Bureau sent a notice to collect and bury 17 refugees and 59 children's corpses. The burial team collected 683 men and women who were bombed to death at Zhoujiaqiao, Beixinjing, Yejidun, South Railway Station, Great World, and Nanjing Road, as well as 6 floating corpses. 41 refugees in the Hongkou area. Residents of Special District 1 and 2 sent letters requesting the collection and burial of 247 refugees and 845 children's corpses. Nanshi Sub-Villa collected and buried 18 refugees and 161 children's corpses. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession sent a notice to collect and bury 1,662 male and female corpses and 7,130 children's corpses, totaling 17,670 male and female corpses of all sizes. This work was all assisted and cooperated by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the Chinese Red Cross, and the Shanghai Relief Committee. The villa's tomb was originally in the Dabao Beiyi area, but after it became a war zone, it was changed to be buried in the Nanshi and Hongqiao tombs. However, due to the recent changes in the situation in Shanghai, the traffic was blocked, and the villa tried its best to find a safe area in the Huxi Special Zone to be opened as a temporary tomb. Because the handling was fast, the villa's collection of corpses was not interrupted for a day. It is reported that the villa has agreed to the request of the International Red Cross to take on the task of collecting and burying the accumulated corpses in the Nanshi refugee area, and has contacted the French Police Department a few days ago to start the process. Also, residents of the Concession who encounter deaths and have nowhere to bury them can also prepare official letters and request the villa to temporarily bury them. After the situation is calm in the future, they can still be claimed and buried by themselves.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Changes in the Battle Situation on the Sujia Line</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The recent battles on the Jiangzhe Defense Line have seen significant changes. The enemy, due to the addition of tens of thousands of reinforcements, has been able to aggressively invade the Gangwen area. Our important points of Suzhou and Jiaxing have finally been abandoned with a heavy heart due to strategic considerations. What we now hope for is that our troops can maintain a long-term defense on the Jiangyin-Wuxing line. At the same time, we can make maximum use of guerrilla tactics to wear down the enemy's strength. This way, the capital's position can be consolidated.</p>
<p>Our military authorities are extremely determined to defend the capital. The relocation of the National Government to Chongqing in the west, while leaving all military organs behind, is a clear demonstration of this. The Spanish Republican Army successfully defended Madrid in a similar way. May our capital have the same glory as Madrid.</p>
<p>Of course, Nanjing and Madrid have very different terrains. Perhaps we may not be able to defend it as long as Madrid. But since our country has not fallen into the same state of disintegration as Spain, and the impact of this war against Japan on world peace is far greater than that of the Spanish Civil War, the future of our resistance war is actually brighter than that of Spain. As long as we can sustain the defense of the capital for two or three months, the favorable situation on the international and domestic fronts will definitely become clear.</p>
<p>The National Government's move to Chongqing expresses its determination to rather be a shattered jade than a complete tile, and declares that it will engage in a larger-scale and more sustained battle thereafter. We believe that the capital can certainly be defended for a considerable period of time. Even if it is unfortunately lost one day, the future of the resistance war is by no means pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Refugee District Representatives Shen Xinfu and Others Request Expansion of the Refugee District</h3>
<p>Large Number of People But Small Area, Still Sleeping on the Streets in Wind, Cold, and Rain, Food Supplies Exhausted and Urgently Awaiting Assistance</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the great war in the city, since Father Jacquinot contacted various relevant parties and designated the area between Minguo Road and Fangbang Road in Nanshi as a refugee area, the fellow refugees from Pudong Nanshi who survived the artillery fire, were displaced and gathered here. Including the businesses that originally existed in the area that had not been evacuated, there are a total of more than 200,000 people. Fortunately, Father Jacquinot, the International Relief Committee, and the French Concession authorities have made every effort to shelter them and maintain the security of the area. However, the number of people is large and the area is small. In this cold wind and rain, many are still sleeping on the streets. They hope to expand the area and obtain a roof over their heads to prolong their lives. The larger shops in the area specially discussed and dispatched several people, including Shen Xinfu, the standing committee member of the business association in the area, and executive and supervisory committee members, to visit those who are concerned: ㊀ Please find a way to expand the refugee area to Zhaojia Road. ㊁ Please move the sandbags, barbed wire, and other items that are no longer suitable for use in Nanshi and set them up around the refugee area, and set up import and export ports. In addition to the refugees from the shelters and the merchants with certificates from the business association, other people will be inspected or refused entry. ㊂ Please ask the French Concession authorities to open the iron gates opposite Dajing Road and Xiaodongmen for several hours a day or issue a certain number of passes to facilitate the entry and exit of goods from the stores in the area (but the goods are limited to oil, salt, firewood, rice, etc.). ㊃ Select a number of representatives of pure merchants who have lived in the area for more than three years to assist the International Relief Committee in handling sanitation, food, and discipline matters. ㊄ Set up a registration office for people who are lost in the war zone.</p>
<p>Father Jacquinot of the Nanshi Refugee Office telephoned the Shanghai Xilianyi Association yesterday, stating that there were no less than 200,000 refugees in the area, with huge supplies, and the food had been exhausted. After checking the inventory, it was only enough for two days. If assistance is not provided quickly, the tragedy of food shortages and hunger will inevitably be repeated. Therefore, he asked the association to quickly raise funds and provide a large amount of food to avoid interruption and panic. After the association learned about the situation, in addition to immediately sending a large number of food items donated by various sectors to the International Relief Committee for distribution to provide assistance, it also regarded the matter as a serious military matter. How to properly coordinate the refugee supplies in the future is a problem. It is necessary to expand the fundraising, make persistent efforts, and appeal to all sectors to donate. Therefore, the association issued another notice, calling on all sectors to enthusiastically donate food to prevent the more than 200,000 refugees in dire straits from falling into despair. Please call the association at 35627 to notify the association to send someone to collect it. Saving the dead and bringing the flesh back to the bones is truly a immeasurable merit.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Agency apologizes for the error in the Jilin West Newspaper's general discussion of the city's refugee problem, in which the phrase "If you want to seek the restoration of Shanghai's industry, the authorities should make the skilled workers difficult to stay in Shanghai for a long time." The "局" (bureau) character was a "勿" (do not) character, and there was a great difference in text, we have make this special correction.</p>
