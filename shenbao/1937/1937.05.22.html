<h3>晉北之行（下）</h3>
<p>— 徐弋吾</p>
<p>越過雁關</p>
<p>二十三日過雁門關住趙莊。雁門關高約海拔七千尺，上有李牧祠，有聯曰：“將軍已故塞民哀胡虜心驚敗潰，雁門仍在天日悲庶黎壯氣勝當！”</p>
<p>這樣長長的付對聯，黑地金字，配上一個着“英風千古紅地黑字的匾額，嚴肅，悲壯，雄渾……歷史的雄偉，後人們憑吊到此，怎不感慨系之　李牧將軍端坐在神櫥裹，白面魁悟，”綹長鬚，隨風飄着，一副英雄的氣慨活躍在我們的眼　。一個七十餘歲的老道人關主持着廟裏的香火，把招待我們茶水，我問道人關於近年香火的情形。他嘆了一口氣說：不必說了，這樣值得崇拜的李將軍，三年沒有過一次葷祭，過路客人，有錢的賣買人很多，誰肯出幾個香資呢？還是受苦的車管（車夫）有義氣些，三毛兩毛的香資常常捐給，我這個七十三歲的道人，沒有咱們窮苦朋友幫助，也就活不成了。前天省裏釆人說；一閻主任提倡復祀廟宇，雁門關的李牧祠也打算從新修葺一番。一這事起因，聽說是日本鬼子要想侵佔咱們山西地皮，閻主任决心禦外侮，特地提　做好人，已經亡故了的好人，都想表彰表彰他的事蹟一呵！</p>
<p>“歷代民族英雄，都得褒揚才是：一老這人說着，露着可愛的笑容。”</p>
<p>雁門關山勢險要，出關下山，冰谷峻峭、朔風怒吼，蠕蠕緊拉着繮繩，騾子一步跌，煞是危險，黃沙滿空、天日爲蔽，漢唐以還，北征匈奴，史載胥由雁門關出兵，關外卽古戰望，西至殺虎口，袤長七百餘里，不知理沒着歷史上多少英魂俠骨？這時候，從車夫日裏唱出一個悲壯的歌謠，使旅人聽了興奮萬分；</p>
<p>一支民歌</p>
<p>“雁門關呀鬼門關，血呀骸骨呀！趙國有個李將軍，把守雁門將身殉，三千健兒四千馬，打退胡兒百萬羣，啊！李將軍反而把命送！唐朝有個李克用，兩道白眉稱英雄，十二太保武藝高，好比虎來好比龍，朱溫賊設奸謀，害了克用並太保，北州失掉了！宋朝出了楊家將，一家忠心將國報，楊令公七十歲把帥印，調兵遣將件件能，七個郎君打前陣，愛護兵來愛護民，可憐那老將軍，衝鋒陷陣憑老身，七個郎君五個把命殞，楊四郎喪良心，投了番邦又招親，楊五郎守本分，五台山上當僧人，楊五郎真痛心，四馬分屍命歸陰！憑有那，漢朝李廣偕李陵，李廣老將軍，一箭驚敵人，單于抱頭走，因奴心胆寒，李陵陷番邦，無心吃來無心飲，可憐那，一朝父子英雊漢，保了江山把命送，憑有那，漢朝蘇武爺，出和番，去牧羊，冰雪裏了殘生，可恨朝廷昏瞆了，聽了奸賊議，害了忠臣身，昭君娘娘是國色，是天香，沒恥的昏君喪心的賊，把娘娘硬強送給番邦了，雁門關呀鬼門關呀！血呀骸骨呀”！</p>
<p>這個含有歷史敎訓，民族史料的歌謡，從勞動羣衆車夫們口中唱出來，音調悲壯激昂，襯著雁門的外景，多麼令人感奮啊！</p>
<p>沒有壯丁的村莊</p>
<p>晚上住趙莊，這個小村莊給關外的狂風飛沙掩沒了三分之一的面積，三日兩頭刮風，是這裏的正常氣候，這裏老百姓很窮苦，沒莊稼，沒生產，我所看見的只有老的、幼的，婦人，却很少見壯年人，問他們的孩子呢？孩子的爸爸呢？你們的丈夫呢？都說是　到口外營生了。原來晋北！尤其是雁門關以北，地瘠多砂，不能種植，民衆生計很困難，大都西出殺虎口，北出得勝口，到後套蒙占各地營生，他們營生的方法，約分小商人，僱傭兩種，常年旅外營生，三兩年也說不定不能歸家鄉一趟，所以村裏的壯丁是很少居留得住。</p>
<p>晋軍的士氣</p>
<p>二十三日發趙莊，行九十里住懷仁縣，卽古雲州地，城廓高聳，氣勢雄偉，入城，古祠廟，屬目皆是，住東關雙勝店，有李服膺部一連十兵先我佔住於此、鍋灶一切，客人無法使用，晚間，找與幾個士兵攀談，知道山西軍官，最怕的是內戰，他們很服從長官的命令，如果是對外開戰，地們更是服從命令，奮不顧身。因為山四綏遠有唇齒相關，綏遠一失，山西卽不能保，現在國離當顛，身家危殆，山西官兵，人人知道守土抗日是天經地義的責任。</p>
<p>二十四日山懷仁到大同，也是九十里，蠕蠕因我們待他好，他又回到老家一次，所以特別高興，一條鞭拍拍拍地只管在老騾子背上抽，下午一點鐘，我們便到大同了。</p>
<p>撇了雲崗走綏東</p>
<p>在大同住了一天，照通常旅行家的想頭，自然少不了走雲崗寺，五台山一趟瞻仰瞻仰山西的名勝。可是到大同後，卻渴想知道防前綫的實况，就决計先到綏東去。</p>

<h3>時評</h3>
<h3>美國與太平洋</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>自從澳大利亞總理萊昂斯於英帝國會議中提議締結太平洋上的互不侵犯條約以來。關於太平洋上局勢的發展。一時又引起了廣泛的注意。現在最受注意的問題。為太平洋岸各國對於這建議的態度怎樣。在這裏。美國的反應如何。尤其引起各方面的關切。美國是大平洋東岸的一個最大勢力。美國在中國有着鉅額的投資。它與英國同是受到日本侵華最大影響的國家。它又是華盛頓條約與九國公約的主倡者。所以美國對於太平洋局勢的態度如何。和這個互不侵犯公約的成功與否。是大有關係的。</p>
<p>據前日消息。美國對於澳大利亞總理這次的提議。抱着靜觀的態度。同時有人表示意見則以為太平洋上已有九國公約的存在。似乎所謂太平洋岸的互不侵犯公約。是並不需要的。這種態度與意見曾經引起了不少人的疑慮。尤其是最近數月來美國曾經通過了新中立法案。曾經討論到菲島中立化的問題。在上海美人所辦的密勒氏評論報甚至有幾篇文字。論到過美國退出遠東政治的問題。究竟美國對於太平洋的政策。是否有了變更。究竟它平洋岸互不侵犯公約的建議。是否眞正的表示冷淡。這問題對於太在太平洋局勢顯示着重要發展的現刻。是非常值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>我們可以從兩方面觀察這個问題。第一是最近幾年來美國在太平洋方面的設施。第二是英美兩大勢力間近年來關係的發展。</p>
<p>關於第一個方面。我們注意到。在近年來。羅斯福總統雖然埋頭於處理國內的问題。但在太平洋海軍勢力的擴充及海上交通的發展上。也仍是毫不放松。夏威夷羣島附近的海軍演戰。每年都擴大舉行太平洋中部各島嶼。已劃歸海軍部管理。汎美公司的橫渡太平洋航空綫業已成功。現在又在開闢夏威夷與澳洲之間的航空綫。就是在菲島方面。由於前美國陸軍參謀長麥克阿色的主持。也已在不斷加强其防禦力。這些事實證明了一點。卽美國雖然不明白表示其反對日本侵略我國的態度。但却在埋頭努力。準備在必要時候採取强硬的反對侵略者的立塲。</p>
<p>上面所謂必要的時候。卽與英國對太平洋的政策有關。在史汀生時代。美國根據華府條約與九國公約的立塲。對於日本的侵略我國。表示抗議。却因為英国不加以實際的支持。未生效力。所以這幾年來。英國為了日本勢力逐漸發展到華中華南。影響它的利益。開始採取堅强的立塲。美國卽採取謹愼的靜觀的熊度。不直接加以支持。而寗願從旁加以贊助。尤其是在英國保守黨政府未擺脫其猶豫模稜的態度之前。美國的外交界總是冷靜地注意它的發展。而不願貿然站在前面的。然而這並不表示美國會聽任太平洋局勢的自然發展或放棄與英國合作的意思。在意阿戰爭時候。美國曾暗中帮助了英國。美國對於英國的自治領。一向保持着良好的關係。最近南非聯邦的斯默茲將軍。在帝國會議中主張英國與美國合作。共维世界和平。更是顯著的證明。所以這次澳洲總理萊昂斯關於太平洋岸不侵犯公約的建議。美國是必然抱着同情的。它的指出太平洋上已有九國公約的存在。當是暗示將來不侵犯公約的訂立。應以保障我国的领土完整及主權獨立為第一義而已。</p>
<h3>英國倡議調解西班牙內戰</h3>

<p>［巴黎］關於英政府提議調停西班牙內戰、俾克成立休戰協定一項消息、此間各報頃多加以評論、巴黎廻聲報載稱、法比兩國政府與梵蒂岡敎廷、均已表示贊同之意、比外長斯巴克昨與法外長台爾博斯進行談話時、並云、比國願設法促進休戰談判、但本報（巴黎廻聲報自稱）以為此事、須由倫敦調整委員會出面調處、實較妥便、小日報則謂國聯行政院本月下旬開會時、西班牙首席代表伐育殆當以制止外國干涉內亂為口實、而提議設立調查委員會、俾其在適當時機成為調解委員會云、（中央社二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙比京　消息靈通人士頃宣稱、關於西班牙內戰問題、法外長、台爾博斯日昨曾以一種消息、通知比外長斯巴克、據、云、渠日前在倫敦與英國當局進行談話時、曾經商定現在西班牙參加內戰之外國志願兵、苟欲予以撤退、最善之法、端在使該國內戰當事雙方暫行停戰、英國并據以徵詢關係各國、尤其是意德兩國政府意見、其中德國政府業已贊成此議云、（中央社二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙直布羅陀　盛傳意相墨索里尼已暗示西國民軍總司令弗朗哥將軍、謂擬將在西之意兵全行撤回、國民軍因此大偽不安、聞墨氏作此决議、乃因曾接在西助戰之意兵家屬代表團視察西班牙戰局之報告、內稱、西班牙戰局仍無變動、徒死外兵萬人、其中意人佔大部分云、（中央社二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］意相墨索里尼準備撤回在西作戰意兵之說、今尚無從徵實、惟意志願兵之父母與親戚對於西戰、怨聲嘖嘖、今已為公開之秘密矣、（中央社二十一日路透電）</p>

<h3>西班牙政府致國聯電</h3>
<p>英認為不合時宜</p>
<p>［日內瓦］西班牙共和政府外長吉拉爾、頃致電國聯秘書長愛文諾、略稱、“就西班牙政府之意見、外國干涉西內戰一事日見擴大、國聯行政院前於去年十二月間舉行臨時會議時、業將此項問題加以討論、今茲自當决定予以賡續討論”云、愛文諾頃决定將西國共和政府此項申請、列入行政院常會議事日程之內、行政院開會時、當由西國首席代表伐育發表演說、就所提申請加以說明、一般人以為此項演說之內熔、將與去年十二月間伐育在行政院臨時會議中所發表之演說、大略相同、僅其報告事實之性質、而別無其他主張、則以西班牙政府大約不欲妨碍倫敦調整委員會之工作故也、（中央社二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英日對暹羅的暗鬥（下）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>克拉運河仍為注意的焦點</p>
<p>暹羅人民的購買力、是很低的、這半由於專制紕政的原故，因此日本廉價的商品，極合暹人的胃口。一九三三年日本輸往暹羅的商品，共值日金一千八百萬元，一九三五年巴增至四千萬元，一九三六年續見增加。在一九三一年之前、日本沒有一船，按期開至暹羅、今日呢，三井會社新造六千噸裝第色兩發動極高速度的輪船四艘，跟大版商船會社的輪船一艘，來往於日本跟盤谷之間，每兩星期開行班，因為航運異常發達，兩會社已從一九三五年十二月一日起把運費提高百分之十。至於英國對暹的輸出貿易，尤其是蘭開夏的，從下載的數字，可以證明已漸漸為日人所奪。一九三三至三四年，新加坡連同英國運暹的商品，共值千三百五十萬巴赫特、（暹幣名，每一巴赫特約值美金四角五分。）那一年中日本運暹的商品，共值一千四百六十萬巴赫特。到了一九三四至三五年，英國的數字，是二千五百四十萬、日本的數字卻增至二千一百十萬。運暹的日貨、棉織品佔百分之六十五，一九三六年三月二十一日，暹政府宣布新稅則，曾把各稅律减輕。</p>
<p>日暹兩國間的貿易，雖然日本仍佔着很大的出超，（一九三五年暹羅對日輸出共值日金五百五十萬元。）但是暹羅目正在大規模發展如橡皮錫柚樹等的天然利源，所以很有彌補入超的希望。近又有日本棉業專家多人，行抵暹羅、暹政府目下還正在聘用日本農業經濟事敎授一員。在已往四年中，暹羅的棉花產額、已增加三倍。）九一九年暹羅只有日僑二百八十五人，一九二九年增多百分之十，現在據日人方面估計，已有一千人之多。但此輩日僑，並非長住，大多數是日本商行的僱員。日本從未視暹羅爲過剩人口可能的尾閭。</p>
<p>日本跟暹羅敦睦友誼，日見注重，究竟抱有什麼目的呢？假使吾人知道現在暹羅海軍軍官跟士官候補生都在日本軍艦上受訓練、暹羅隨軍軍官都不進歐洲的陸軍專校，而改入日本的軍校，日本的預算案列有東京盤谷間的航空綫經費，那末，說日暹兩國的密切合作，全為了經濟原因，誰能相信呢？據傳最近充日本駐盤谷海軍委員的海軍少校大野曾說道：“暹羅有很多人士主張組織亞細亞聯盟，而以日本為盟主。”英人方面聽得這個消息，頗為震驚，這是日本商業考察團剛要到暹羅前的話。商業考察團到暹得手之後，暹羅外相瑪魯特哈姆氏覺得國外的人心日見恐慌很不利於暹羅，故在日團才離暹羅的當兒便發表安定人心的言論，否認暹羅主張利用一國，以制他國，並切實聲明暹羅跟英國的友好財政關係，毫無變動。這種言論英國政界讀了，當然滿意而有興趣，可是其中却缺少着一點，那便是唐育街提心吊膽的克拉運河計畫。</p>
<p>英國因為日本很有圖斷新加坡的咽嗽的氣象，所以趕緊在克拉地頸設法維持權力的平衡。聽說目下正在計議修正英暹的條約關係，但是只怕時已太遲了。日本的汎亞主義，跟佛敎徒團結的呼籲，也許終制勝英國的財政顧問吧。暹羅在亞細亞東南部的統治上，有絕大的軍略關係，從來未曾像今日這麼顯明。日德協定，據傳其中還訂有秘密條欵，目的是在把荷屬東印度劃入德日兩國的勢力範圍，很足說明日本南進擴張勢力的傾向。日本在暹羅得到一個根椐地，便能得到優越的便利，旣可撰取荷屬東印度，又可由後方攻擊蔽護荷蘭殖民地的新加坡。但暹羅關於運河計畫的直正關係，那是在本身上可以現明的。像暹羅首相斐亞氏所倡的和平中立計畫，竟沒有實現的機會，眞可使人深切抱憾。克拉運河計畫，可算得歷來提出便利世界商亞跟交通最合理的計畫之一，不應該讓政治的忌妬阻止它的實現。今有一個問題，須得問明，卽英國不開啟價新門戶，反而禁阻的政策，是否正當。在這兒德日兩國間的諒解，也能使本問題透露一點新理由、原來斐亞氏是普魯士陸軍專校的畢業生，並且跟戈林將軍是窗友。他日也許會發生一種局勢，由列強聯合，強迫開啟這個新門戶，而置英國於不顧。至於目前泰西各國的權力，或者還能夠跟日本的威望相抗，但是英國已預先戒備，目前她正在花費數百萬金錢，修治新加坡的防務哩。（譯自美車亞細亞雜誌）</p>

<h3>聚興誠銀行經理任望南談川振</h3>
<p>川省旱災嚴重、川人向各方奔走呼𥸤現政府當局及各方人士、正籌撥振欵、救濟災黎、但以川省謠諑紛紜中央前撥公債一百萬元、所抵押之現欵七十一萬四千餘元、據川省紳耆邵明升等來電、迄未收領、中央社記者為欲明瞭此事真相起見、特往訪甫由川省返滬之聚興誠銀行經理仟望南氏、據該如下、</p>

<p>本人（任氏自稱）初以迭據川中來電報告、川省旱災嚴重、千萬災黎、嗷嗷待振、爰經與振務委員會委員長朱子橋請示振濟辦法、當時朱委員長與中央財政當局、商定先撥公債一百萬元、變現後、卽發交川雀振災會施振、一方面由朱委員長暨財政療專員曹仲植、偕同本人等赴川、惟當時川省府、對於各縣災情尚未有切實查報、故朱委員長曹專員等在川至各處分別查勘災情、分配振欵、</p>
<p>撥匯振欵</p>
<p>至於中央所撥之公債百厲元、自經中央撥發後、卽設法變現、於上月度交割時、領得現欵七十一萬四千餘元、由朱委員長送交銀行、但以手績較繁未能卽時匯出、據振災會謝駕十委員函告、該欵於本月十七日由京滙川據本人所測、大概該欵將先匯交重慶、再轉成都、故成者方面迄未知該欵已滙川、</p>
<p>川發公債</p>
<p>川省政府方面、因中央所撥振穎七十餘萬元、尚不敷分配、故擬另籌發振災公債千二百萬元、其中二百萬擬向川中金融界抵借一百萬元、惟當時因川中傳說紛紛以致此事進行亦發生困離、惟擦川財政廳廳長劉航琛云、川中金融界已尤墊借、但此事尚須請中央核示云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>母為亂世人</h3>
<p>— 何必</p>
<p>最近的報章上幾乎每天可以讀到死亡的新聞，天津的浮屍案旣源源而來，豫川黔甘等省則災情嚴重，災民數百萬嗷嗷待哺，其他如本埠發現之支解女屍，及粵女吳露莉服毒等案，更無足論矣。諺云“寗為太平狗，母為亂世人”，所謂“亂世”，大概不見得專指狹義的戰亂時代吧。</p>
<p>關於天津浮屍案，據今日日本報天津通信，則眞相業已大白”。一部份是無錢過癮的毒犯，在癮發不能動彈時，卽由白面館僱人拋之河中，另一部份是誤信人言，被誘往關外工作的苦工，在未及成行之前，微有疾病，或發覺被騙而不願前往者，亦多被棄河淹斃。這各方注目的“浮屍案”，想來至此可告一段落矣。亦何怪津市新聞檢查所始則令各報一律稱為“毒丐”，現在則索性一字不許提起了。這許多被竹篙插入屍體之肛門或腋部，拖入河內的冤鬼，眞落得“死無葬身之地”這句古話了。</p>
<p>今年各省之災情，是歷年所未有，每縣每日之死亡人數，由三十人至二百人左右。卽使掘得白泥，草根等暫時果腹者，也因而發生不能排洩，脚腫等症而命在旦夕。所幸“商討具體救濟辦法”之後，財部已撥發川災賑欵公債一百萬元，於四月六日卽交由賑務委會散放。并因救災不容遲緩，經電請三行借墊三十萬，辦理急賑等情。但是南京二十日電：財部頃接川省紳耆邵明升尹仲錫等來電，謂賑欵尚未領得，極為詫異”云。—眞是“詫異”得很，“於四月六日卽交由賑務委員散放”的賑欵，迄至五月一十日而“尚未領得”。慈善家們在災區視察之餘，大概“四野災民，三五成羣，鳩形鵠面，衣衫襤褸，稚兒弱女，懷褓背負，手提竹籃，傴僂地上，掘草根以充食糧”的慘狀總不至於轉眼卽忘吧？救災如救火，現在反開起“特別慢車”來，數百萬災民或許等不及賑欵散放，早已到閻王殿上去做餓死鬼了。</p>
<p>至於本埠發現的支解女屍，及粵女吳露莉服毒自殺，那是隨手拾來的例子。每天打開社會版，幾乎都是：妬姦，服毒，跳樓，投浦等記載，五花八門，目不暇接。歸納起來，後者都是被經濟壓迫，無以活命，於是一死了之。這雖然是關際於個人的，但市面衰落，失業成羣，我們如何能苛責死者是“懦者之所為”呢？關於前者自然是要不得的，談戀愛果然是人生的一種需求，但“以身殉情”總太輕視了自己有為的生命吧。雖然現在有許多人連這一點“自由”都被剝奪了。</p>
<p>然而旣生而為“亂世人”了，—人倒底還是人而不是狗，所幸還不致於做天津的“毒丐”，和災區的難民，就應該更把自己的生命看得貴重一點！</p>
<h3>落日</h3>
<p>— 戈夷</p>
<p>倦然地從痛苦的記憶中出來，抬了眼，在西方的天邊失了牠中午强熾的光芒的落日和我打了個照面；牠似乎有一個對我鄙視的微笑，彷彿像一個熟識的朋友老遠立在那邊瞻視我可笑的動作與哀感的獨白而作出的面容。</p>
<p>人們哀悼青春如同落日而悵然於“夕陽無限好，只是近黃昏的意境。我另有一個比想：一個一生無疚的老者含笑地的彌留之偉大。</p>
<p>我現在不能忘懷年老祖父那一個落日的情境。他躺在他手建的茅屋裏的硬板床上，朦朧地望着從小方窗射進集中</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>在他臥着的平個房間的落日光輝，他滿足地頹然冥目了。那臉上是慈祥和平的∣沒有遺憾，沒有留戀。如個疲乏了就睡的孩子。</p>
<p>祖父對着父親說：</p>
<p>—我要好好地休息了，我一生沒有負了債•我高興的•</p>
<p>祖父是一個老實的農夫，父親也是一個老實的。他們吃着自己汗血壅下泥土裏發出的氣息，帶着他們的孩子在山麓的平原悠然地忘了歲月的只是耕種着。每天落日的傍晚，他們就牽着耕牛馱着乾稭回來；在溪邊濯足，在石上看一回星月。毫無醜惡的在夢境裏睡到了明日的鷄啼。</p>
<p>如今一代的靑年人却不然了！他們對落日懷着無限的惆悵，於生命的末稍感到生的空虛，於往日的夢境湧上難堪的疚心！死的恐怖與生的留戀交織着，在這剎那間他們只有一顆焦急痛苦的心。</p>
<p>—人生是無聊與苦痛的。他們說•我深深地記得一個夭折了的朋友，他在知道將死的一剎那悲慟的言語：</p>
<p>—××，我不願現在死了！……上帝……我…</p>
<p>那繼續的呻吟是颤抖的像一隻創傷流血的野獸的呼嘷！</p>
<p>但是，這個朋友在他正靑春的時候却寫了許多祈死的文章！他咒咀人生，他自已戳破他一個可現出的夢境，他成天對人生在復仇而終于掘成自己的墳墓。可是他在臨去的世界裏却又那樣矛盾的想再生一會！</p>
<p>落日循着牠的軌道走過來的，牠有過給詩人們謳歌的旭日，有過給革命者輸送熱力的中午。自朝晨到了夕暮，牠給人間儲種着許多的潛熱給人們溫暖的記念。</p>
<p>你說：你能哀悼牠的命運麼？你自己有勇氣有落日之前低訴人之哀慟麼？落日沈沒了。在夜間牠仍給月亮以光茫呢。</p>
<h3>各國靑年消閒的活動</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>本埠婦女團體共同委員會所主持的俱樂部會社，本月十九日上午在靜安寺路美國婦女俱樂部事務所舉行第九屆年會，中西各國女士參加者共約二百人。因為這次會議的目的，是討論靑年問題，所以四壁滿貼着各國靑年的圖像，壁架上還掛着許多紀述各國靑年運動的小冊子，供入瀏覽，室中充滿着靑春的空氣。</p>
<p>先由美國婦女俱樂部會長考尼煦夫人致詞歡迎到會的諸女士，次由共同委員會主席徽特萊夫人致詞，略述共同委員會是由中英美等國婦女俱樂部組合而成，歷年來曾喚起社會注意，如童工住屋，黃包車問題。共同委員會對於這三個問題的活動，已由本埠市政當局接受，而設法補救了，共同委員會時常關心本埠的重要問題，又曾設立職業指導小組委員會，本屆會議所討論的“是靑年跟他們的消閒活動問題”。這個問題，很為復雜，在短短的兩天會期之中，怕不能顧到全部。但本會擬查明海外對於這事的一切行動，然後再考察上海的一切狀况，跟用什麼方法可以改善現在所有的過失，希望委員會能得到輔助靑年的具體建議，而可有益於大衆。</p>
<p>次醫士羅曼女士提出上海是不是一個“靑年城”問題。她說：因為上海三個市政局編製戶口表冊的方法，各各不同，所以上海人的年齡，不能得其眞相。據她的意見，十五歲到二十五歲的外國男女相比之數，女子比男子約多七百人。上海這種年齡的外國男女，共有二萬三千四百五十五人，十五歲以下的男女童，共有一萬二千九百七十九人，二十五歲到四十五歲的男女，共有二萬九千五百五十五人，這一類的男子，比女子多三千六百十五人，四十五歲以上的男女，共有九千三百零三人：可見上海的外國僑民，二十五歲到四十五歲的佔最大部分。上海縱然不是一個“中年城”，也算得是“成年城”，因為十五歲以下的男女，只佔百分之二十，二十五歲以下的，佔百分之三十八，二十五歲以上的，佔百分之六十二。至於中國人口：上海的兒童，却比中國其他任何城為少。上海的華人，在十五歲以上的，佔最大部分，男子却多過女子。女士提出這些枯燥的統計，不過希望會衆注意在討論靑年問題時，須着重佔戶口最多數的成年男女。</p>
<p>羅曼女士發言旣畢，於是由各代表分述各國靑年消閒的活動，以便會衆將來可擇善而從，其中很多有興趣的事實。</p>
<p>首由羅傑森夫人說起英國道：英國民衆很注重靑年消閒活動同題。英故王喬治五世在世時，極關心靑年的發展，因此他駕崩之後，人民以為紀念他的最佳方法，是募集捐欵，在全國設立靑年運動塲，發起之後，助捐的甚為踴躍。英國在學齡以後的消閒活動，純聽本人自願參加，因為英人反對有靑年軍訓意味的一類事情。英政府現正鼓勵地方當局設立運動塲，遊泳池，網球塲等。英國各大工廠至少聘用“幸福事務員”一人，他的職責，是司管工人身體精神的安樂。許多工廠並設立演劇會歌唱會，這些事務在冬季數月中，尤有怡情悅性的特別功效。男女“靑年會”都替男女童設備各種運動，冬季在戶內，夏季却在戶外。“星期學校”也都替靑年設備各種球戲的運動塲，並組織跳舞會，音樂會，小學校的四周，都有供兒童運勁的塲所，所需的土地是由本地當局供給的。此外還有像“扶輪社”導諸團體，助同經營運動事務。英國的“遊行俱樂部”，包括的範圍很廣，其中有“脚踏車俱樂部”，“爬山俱樂部”，“野地生物家會社”種種。“童子軍”跟“女童指導團”也是適合靑年的兩種大需要。還有保守黨工黨自由黨都注意靑年的活動，設備各種娛樂中心點，並組織演說辯論訓練班。每一大城，都設有靑年圖書館，以供靑年於鍜鍊身體之外，增進他們的智識。“婦女公民會社”跟“合作社也使其他數百團體得到它們的輔助。“婦女公民會社”分為事業，敎育，娛樂，集團工作四部。最初成立於一九一五年，去年五月間調查全國已有這種會社五千三百四十二所。英國靑年消閒活動的程序中還有是重要的一項，那便是“靑年旅社聯合會”一九三○年才由利物浦市長仿效德國的辦法創設，不到數年，全國已有這種旅社二百六十所，共有會員六萬人。會員二十一歲以上的，每年納會費五先令，十六歲到二十一歲的，每年納會費兩先令六便士，十四歲到十六歲的每年納會費一先令。凡會員都可寄宿在這二百六十所旅社中，每夜納費一先令，有幾處幼童每夜只須六便士。社內備有潔凈的床位，跟洗濯烹調的便利，并可向管社員購買餐品，取價極廉。會員不過須盡很輕的義務，如在管社員指導之下，洗器疊被之類。“靑年旅社聯合會”設立的宗旨，是使男女靑年有以極廉的旅費旅行大不列顚全部各地的機會。上述各動組織的經費，或由政府撥發，或由國內熱心仕女捐助，都抱着一個大目的，—使一般靑年在工作時間跟工作的餘閒中得到有益身心的進步。（未完）</p>
<h3>賽金花</h3>
<p>— 陳禾製</p>
<p>二十二</p>
<p>賽金花受了，瓦德齊的委託，每天和幾個小軍官到各處去辦糧，商人見是賽金花辦軍需，也敢出來承接買賣了。但沿路仍舊有洋兵抓人，不管是否義和團，只要稍有可疑，就被殺死，賽金花見着的時候，總替他們解說：“他不是義和團，我敢保證！我敢保證！”因之，得保全生命者不知凡計。</p>

<h3>Liu Hangshen Arrives in Beijing to Discuss Disaster Relief Fundraising Methods</h3>
<p>Reports on the Military and Political Situation in Sichuan Province; Previously Allocated Relief Funds Have Already Been Remitted; Liu Xiang Analyzes the Reasons for the Rumors in Sichuan</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Sichuan Chairman Liu Xiang, in order to discuss the Sichuan Province disaster relief public bond fund, and to express his sincere support for the central government, sent a letter and dispatched Director of Finance Liu Hangshen, along with Guan Jiyu, a special commissioner stationed in Sichuan by the Ministry of Finance, who arrived in Beijing on the 21st in the morning to visit the authorities, present Liu's letter, and personally report on the administrative and financial situation and disaster situation in Sichuan Province. He then visited Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin and Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, representing Liu Xiang to report on the political situation in Sichuan Province and the inaccuracy of the rumors. At 11:00 AM, he visited Deputy Ministers of Finance Zou Lin and Xu Kan to discuss the Sichuan Province disaster relief public bond fund, as well as the local budget for the next year, and Sichuan salt tax matters. He attended a banquet hosted by Xu at noon. At 5:30 PM in the afternoon, he visited Secretary-General of the Central Political Council Zhang Qun, describing the disaster and political situation in Sichuan. Regarding financial issues such as the Sichuan disaster relief public bond, it was decided to continue to consult and discuss with Deputy Ministers Zou and Xu on the 22nd, and a decision is expected within days. It is reported that the letter Liu presented to the central government was very earnest, expressing obedience to the six measures for reorganizing Sichuan's administration proposed by the central government, and expressing sincere support. Therefore, the reorganization of Sichuan's administration awaits only the actual performance of the Sichuan authorities. The Sichuan provincial army, regarding personnel, management, organization, and command, will also follow the measures indicated by the central government and reorganize and reorganize according to national army standards. After Liu Hangshen returns to Sichuan to relay the instructions, it will be implemented step by step. As for the request to issue disaster relief public bonds worth 12 million, Liu and Guan only made preliminary discussions when they visited the two Deputy Ministers of Finance on the 21st. The general amount remains the same. In addition to using the Sichuan Province disaster relief reserve fund as collateral, the shortfall will be decided after further discussion on the 23rd. In the afternoon, the local budget will be discussed and finalized within days according to the central government's principles and the province's actual local revenue. In addition, the Ministry of Finance issued 1 million in Sichuan disaster relief public bonds, with a mortgage of more than 700,000 in cash, which was handed over to the relief committee for distribution on April 6. Sichuan gentry telegraphed that they had not yet received it. Recently, personnel from Sichuan Province stated that the remittance had already been remitted a few days ago. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Ba County: Liu Xiang received the visiting tour group and special correspondents from various newspapers at the Sui headquarters yesterday afternoon, and analyzed the reasons for the rumors in Sichuan as follows: (1) Because the methods of judgment and handling of Sichuan Province affairs are not entirely the same, there are different opinions; (2) Following orders to move troops to the eastern part of Sichuan, outsiders mistakenly pointed out that there were military actions. Finally, he said that stabilizing the situation in Sichuan requires starting with the two words "understanding," so that the central and local governments can cooperate to have hope. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu's Letter Contains Earnest Language</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Liu Hangchen, Director of Finance of Sichuan Province, and Guan Jiyu, Special Commissioner of Finance, departed from Sichuan on the 20th, flew to Shanghai, and then took the Beijing-Shanghai train to Beijing that evening. They arrived at Xiaguan on the morning of the 21st and entered the city to pay their respects to the central authorities. Mr. Liu carried a handwritten letter from Sichuan Chairman Liu Xiang and will represent Chairman Liu to report on the recent military and political situation and disaster situation in Sichuan Province. Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Kan, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council Zhang Qun, and Chief Aide-de-Camp of the National Government Lu Chao, among others, were visited. According to reporters' inquiries, what Chairman Liu expressed in his handwritten letter was extremely earnest, supporting the central government and remaining unswerving. Not only is he willing to comply with the six measures previously instructed by Minister He, but he has also proactively made further suggestions. If he can prove it with facts at any time, all rumors can be clarified. The disaster situation in Sichuan Province is indeed extremely serious, especially in Wusheng and Zhongxian counties. Other areas such as Guang'an, Daxian, Qu County, and Yingshan are secondarily affected. Yuechi is suffering from bandit disasters in addition to drought. However, the sixteen counties in western Sichuan have been spared thanks to the water conservancy irrigation of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System. In addition, Sichuan Province has received rain in recent days, and farmland may have hope of recovery. As for the issuance of disaster relief public bonds, it will be handled in accordance with the central government's orders. Currently, Mr. Liu and Mr. Guan are staying in Beijing to negotiate. (21st Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Chengdu] In order to seek fundamental relief for the Sichuan disaster, the Xingying plans to organize agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy loans, and has specially sent team leader Xie Guanyi to Chengdu to discuss everything with the provincial authorities. The result was very satisfactory. It was decided to form an agricultural and forestry loan committee, jointly organized by the Xingying, the Construction Department, and the Finance Department. The Treasury and the Water Conservancy Bureau each sent a member to form the organization. The loan amount was set at one million yuan, with the Xingying and the provincial government each responsible for 500,000 yuan. Xie, with the completion of his mission, scheduled to return to Chongqing on the morning of the 22nd to report. (21st Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Reasons for the Delay in Remitting Sichuan Relief Funds</p>
<p>[Chengdu] The Ministry of Finance telegraphed Rong yesterday to inquire about the reasons for the delay in relief funds. On the day the telegram arrived, the funds had already been remitted. According to the provincial relief association's telegram to the Ministry of Finance, the Jingnong Bank remitted the funds to the Rong branch at 11:30 AM on the 18th, and notified the association at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. On the 19th, the association jointly verified and received the funds with Hong Shan. An official in charge of the Ministry of Finance also stated that the assignment of relief funds to the tax supervisors of various districts to temporarily raise funds was a previous plan and was not implemented. It has now been decided to directly allocate the funds. As for the 1 million yuan in emergency relief funds raised by the provincial government, Liu Hangchen has been working on a solution in Chongqing and it can also be remitted to the province within days. (21st Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to the Relief Committee, the central government's allocation of 1 million yuan in Sichuan relief bonds was received by the Relief Committee in Shanghai in mid-May. The Relief Committee immediately entrusted the Juxingcheng Bank to sell the bonds for cash. The bank, concerned about its hometown, strived to obtain a good price and sold them off in three batches, with a net price of 714,362.42 yuan. This amount was remitted from Shanghai to Beijing at the beginning of this month. At that time, Sichuan Province raised 1 million yuan for relief funds, which has not yet been reported as allocated. The Relief Committee immediately consulted the Ministry of Finance to increase the allocation of relief funds, hoping that the central government could also raise 1 million to be remitted for relief together. Later, Hong Shan, a commissioner sent by the Executive Yuan, returned east from Xikang and arrived in Rong to discuss relief measures with the Sichuan Provincial Relief Association, and immediately telegraphed for the remittance of relief funds. The Relief Committee then remitted the previously sold 710,000 yuan first, which was reportedly received on the 17th. The funds to be additionally allocated by the Ministry of Finance should be remitted later after they are allocated. (21st Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Juesheng Issues a Statement of Defense</h3>
<p>Describes Assistance in Anti-Smuggling Circumstances; Actually Accuses Customs Officials of Not Fulfilling Their Duties</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Chen Juesheng issued a statement on the 21st to defend himself against recent newspaper reports: (1) The railway has not refused to assist in anti-smuggling. There are customs officials at Nandasi Temple in Qinhuangdao, who do not intercept and detain smuggled goods before they are loaded onto trains. The BeiNing Railway cannot refuse transportation in the special zone east of Tanggu. When smuggled goods arrive at the Tianjin East General Station, the Customs is immediately notified. The Customs either arrives late, or witnesses the situation at the station and pretends nothing is happening. How can others be held responsible? (2) The Jicha Committee ordered the railway to investigate the purchase of land in Fengtai. After reporting the situation, there was no further development. The records can be checked at the Wanping County Government and the Administrative Commissioner's Office. (3) The sale of iron at Tang Factory was approved by the Ministry of Railways during the previous term. Recently, an order was received from the Ministry prohibiting the sale and it has been complied with. The facts are clear and can be investigated. (21st dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Respect for China's Rights in Negotiations on Far Eastern Issues</h3>
<p>Eden Reiterates Guarantee to Special Envoy Kong; Pacific Conference Under Discussion</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden met today with Dr. Kong Xiangxi, the Chinese government's special envoy to the coronation of the British King, for talks. Eden guaranteed to Special Envoy Kong that in any negotiations between Britain and any country on the Pacific coast, China's interests would be strictly respected in those negotiations. Diplomatic circles said that Eden's guarantee referred to the ongoing negotiations between Britain and Japan, as China was concerned about these negotiations. Therefore, when British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen visited the Chinese diplomatic authorities in Nanjing last month, he provided the same guarantee. Foreign Secretary Eden has now reiterated it. Diplomatic circles also believe that Foreign Secretary Eden may have mentioned to Special Envoy Kong the proposal made by Australian Prime Minister Lyons at the Imperial Conference to conclude a non-aggression pact between Pacific countries. (Central News Agency, 20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Today, British Foreign Secretary Eden had a long meeting with Kong Xiangxi, the Chinese Finance Minister and Special Envoy celebrating the coronation of the British King. According to Reuters reporters, both sides expressed satisfaction with the friendly relations between China and Britain. In terms of the general situation, both sides feel that the future is very promising. Eden has repeatedly stated that Britain will consult with all relevant countries in any steps it takes to improve the situation in the Far East. Furthermore, Eden is eager to discuss with Kong the Far Eastern issues related to China, as he recently called for the convening of a Far Eastern Conference by Australian Prime Minister Lyons, and diplomatic issues at the Imperial Conference have gradually entered urgent discussions. Furthermore, the Far Eastern issue has been under discussion in London recently. Japanese experts have repeatedly consulted with British government authorities on British-Japanese relations, and the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact may also be discussed.

<h3>Special Envoy Kong Pays Respects to British Chancellor of the Exchequer</h3>
<p>China's Finances Are Stable; Good Atmosphere in London</p>
<p>[London] My country's Special Envoy to the British King's Coronation Ceremony Kong Xiangxi, this morning (21st) visited British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain. In the afternoon, Special Envoy Kong met with the Belgian Ambassador to Britain. (Central News Agency, 21st dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] When interviewed by a Reuters reporter today, Special Envoy Kong happily mentioned his meeting with British Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday and expressed great trust in Britain's sincerity in caring about China's happiness. He also said that China's concern about the British-Japanese talks in London is unfounded. It is believed that the British-Japanese talks will continue after the Imperial Conference ends. Rumors that not only Sino-Japanese relations but also Russo-Japanese relations have improved recently have created a good impression in London. After meeting with Viscount Kano, manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank branch this morning, Kong visited British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain with Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi for a long talk. Although China's financial plan is not yet clear, it can be said that the atmosphere in the City of London regarding China's finances seems indeed good. One of the characteristics of the arrival of the Chinese delegation to the British King's Coronation Ceremony is that it has attracted attention from the newspapers. For example, the Standard Evening News today published news about China's monetary reform, stable domestic debt, railway progress, and political unification, saying that China seems to be progressing towards a great future in industry, and that the cost of Chinese products is quite low and China's exports will increase in the future. Ambassador Guo is scheduled to host a banquet at noon tomorrow for the British House of Commons China Affairs Committee and the Chinese delegation. On Sunday, Special Envoy Kong will visit Oxford University with Ambassador Guo. Special Envoy Kong is scheduled to depart for Geneva on May 25. Although Kong attends banquets and handles official business in London, he is radiant and in better health than when he first arrived. The Chinese Association Committee and the British Industries Federation hosted a public banquet for the Chinese delegation tonight. Secretary of Commerce Hore-Belisha, Ambassador Guo, and former British Education Minister Lord Percy were among the guests. When Lord Winterton raised his glass to toast the Chinese delegation, he declared that today, several parties are unduly worried that the British government intends to make an agreement with another strong country that is detrimental to China's interests. British Foreign Secretary Eden has given it a firm denial. I hope this denial will be accepted and there will be no doubts, because I know that the Foreign Secretary's denial is sincere. The Earl also stated, "As a member of the House of Commons, I dare say that any agreement reached between Britain and any strong country regarding China will not be supported by the House of Commons."

<h3>British Morning Post on the Far Eastern Issue</h3>
<p>[London]</p>
<p>The Shanghai correspondent of the Conservative Party's Morning Post commented on the Far Eastern issue yesterday, stating that if the United States, Britain, France and Japan could provide financial assistance to China, international cooperation in the Far East could be achieved. The real difficulty lies in the fact that China and Japan must resolve various issues beforehand. In short, "Whether Britain and Japan can cooperate depends on whether the Japanese government is willing to break away from the power of the military and cooperate with the United States and China. Since Japan cannot regard concession as surrender, and the Chinese authorities want to improve Sino-Japanese relations and promote international cooperation in order to obtain financial assistance for construction, the idea of diplomatically defeating Japan must also be prevented, so as not to cause resentment."

<h3>Journey to Northern Shanxi (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi-wu</p>
<p>Crossing Yanmen Pass</p>
<p>On the 23rd, we crossed Yanmen Pass and stayed in Zhao Village. Yanmen Pass is about 7,000 feet above sea level and has a Li Mu Temple. There is a couplet that reads: "The general is dead, the frontier people mourn, the Hu captives are frightened and defeated; Yanmen is still there, the heavens and the sun grieve, the common people's morale is strong and victorious!"</p>
<p>Such a long antithetical couplet, gold letters on a black background, paired with a plaque with the words "Eternal Heroic Spirit" in black letters on a red background, is solemn, tragic, and majestic... The magnificence of history, how can later generations not be filled with emotion upon reaching this place? General Li Mu sits upright in the shrine, with a white face and a stalwart figure, a long flowing beard, and the air of a hero is alive in our eyes. An old Taoist priest in his seventies presides over the incense in the temple and serves us tea. I asked the Taoist priest about the recent incense offerings. He sighed and said: "No need to say it, such an admirable General Li has not had a single meat sacrifice in three years. There are many wealthy merchants passing by, but who is willing to donate a few incense coins? It is still the suffering carters (rickshaw pullers) who are more righteous, often donating three or two mao for incense. This Taoist priest of seventy-three years old would not be able to survive without the help of our poor friends. The other day, someone from the province said: Director Yan is advocating the restoration of temples, and the Li Mu Temple at Yanmen Pass is also planning to be renovated. The reason for this is said to be that the Japanese devils want to seize our land in Shanxi, and Director Yan is determined to resist foreign aggression, so he specially promotes the good deeds of the good people who have already passed away!"</p>
<p>"Heroes of all dynasties must be praised!" the old man said, revealing a lovable smile.</p>
<p>The terrain of Yanmen Pass is treacherous. Going out of the pass and down the mountain, the ice valley is steep, and the north wind roars. The rickshaw puller tightly pulls the reins, and the mule stumbles, which is very dangerous. The yellow sand fills the sky, obscuring the sun. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, history records that expeditions to the Xiongnu barbarians have been launched from Yanmen Pass. Outside the pass is the ancient battlefield, extending 700 li west to the Tiger-Killing Pass. I wonder how many heroic souls and chivalrous bones are buried in history? At this time, a tragic folk song sung by the rickshaw puller made the travelers excited:</p>
<p>A Folk Song</p>
<p>"Yanmen Pass, the Gate of Hell, blood and bones! Zhao had a General Li who guarded Yanmen and gave his life. Three thousand brave soldiers and four thousand horses drove back a million Hu. Ah! General Li lost his life instead! The Tang Dynasty had Li Keyong, whose white eyebrows were called heroes. The twelve bodyguards had high martial arts skills, like tigers and dragons. The traitor Zhu Wen set a treacherous plot, harming Keyong and the bodyguards, and Beizhou was lost! The Song Dynasty produced the Yang family generals, whose whole family was loyal and reported to the country. Commander Yang, at seventy years old, took the marshal's seal and was able to command troops in everything. The seven sons fought in the front, loving the soldiers and the people. It is a pity that the old general, relied on his old body to charge into battle. Five of the seven sons lost their lives. Yang Silang lost his conscience, surrendered to the barbarians and remarried. Yang Wulang kept his duty, becoming a monk on Mount Wutai. Yang Wulang was truly heartbroken, his life returned to Yin after being torn apart by four horses! Relying on that, Li Guang and Li Ling of the Han Dynasty, the old General Li Guang frightened the enemy with one arrow. The Chanyu hugged his head and ran away, and the Hun's heart was cold. Li Ling fell into the barbarian land, with no heart to eat and no heart to drink. It is a pity that the father and son of the Han Dynasty defended the country and gave their lives. Relying on that, Su Wu of the Han Dynasty, went to the barbarians to herd sheep, and his life was spent in ice and snow. It is hateful that the court was昏瞆, listened to the traitor's advice, and harmed the loyal minister. Lady Zhaojun is a national beauty, a celestial fragrance, but the shameless and昏君sent the lady to the barbarians by force. Yanmen Pass, the Gate of Hell, blood and bones!"</p>
<p>This folk song, containing historical lessons and ethnic historical materials, sung by the working-class rickshaw pullers, with a tragic and激昂tone, set against the scenery outside Yanmen Pass, is so inspiring!</p>
<p>A Village Without Strong Men</p>
<p>We stayed in Zhao Village for the night. This small village is three-quarters covered by the mad winds and flying sand outside the pass. It is normal weather here to have wind every two or three days. The people here are very poor, with no crops and no production. All I saw were the old, the young, and women, but very few strong men. I asked them, "Where are your children? Where are your fathers? Where are your husbands?" They all said that they had gone outside the pass to make a living. It turns out that northern Shanxi! Especially north of Yanmen Pass, is barren and sandy, unable to grow crops. The livelihood of the people is very difficult, and most of them go west out of the Tiger-Killing Pass and north out of the Desheng Pass to make a living in various places in Houtao Mongolia. They make a living as small merchants or employees, and they often work abroad for many years, perhaps not being able to return home for three or two years. Therefore, very few strong men stay in the village.</p>
<p>The Morale of the Shanxi Army</p>
<p>We left Zhao Village on the 23rd and traveled ninety li to Huai Ren County, which is the ancient Yunzhou area. The city walls are towering and majestic. Entering the city, there are ancient ancestral temples everywhere. We stayed at the Shuangsheng Store in Dongguan. A company of soldiers from Li Fuying's army had already occupied the place before us. The pots and stoves were all occupied, and the guests could not use them. In the evening, I found some soldiers to chat with. I learned that the Shanxi officers were most afraid of internal wars. They were very obedient to their superiors' orders. If it was a war against a foreign enemy, they would be even more obedient to orders and would not hesitate to sacrifice themselves. Because Shanxi and Suiyuan are closely related, if Suiyuan is lost, Shanxi cannot be protected. Now that the country is in danger and the family is in jeopardy, the officers and soldiers of Shanxi all know that defending the territory and resisting Japan is a heaven-sent and righteous responsibility.</p>
<p>On the 24th, we traveled from Huai Ren to Datong, also ninety li. Because the rickshaw puller, 蠕蠕, because we treated him well, he returned to his hometown once, so he was particularly happy, whipping the old mule on the back with a whip. At one o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived in Datong.</p>
<p>Leaving Yungang and Going to Sui East</p>
<p>We stayed in Datong for a day. According to the usual thoughts of travelers, we would naturally go to the Yungang Grottoes and Mount Wutai to admire the famous scenic spots of Shanxi. But after arriving in Datong, we were eager to know the real situation on the front line of defense, so we decided to go to Sui East first.</p>

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<h3>The United States and the Pacific</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Since Australian Prime Minister Lyons proposed concluding a non-aggression treaty in the Pacific Ocean at the British Imperial Conference, the development of the situation in the Pacific has once again attracted widespread attention. The most noteworthy issue now is how the countries on the Pacific coast will react to this proposal. The reaction of the United States is of particular concern. The United States is the largest power on the east coast of the Pacific. The United States has huge investments in China. It and the United Kingdom are the countries most affected by Japan's invasion of China. It is also the initiator of the Washington Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, the attitude of the United States towards the situation in the Pacific and the success or failure of this non-aggression treaty are of great importance.</p>
<p>According to news from the other day, the United States is taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the Australian Prime Minister's proposal. At the same time, some people expressed the opinion that since the Nine-Power Treaty already exists in the Pacific, the so-called non-aggression treaty for the Pacific coast seems unnecessary. This attitude and opinion have caused concern among many people. Especially in recent months, the United States has passed the new Chinese Exclusion Act and has discussed the issue of the neutralization of the Philippines. Several articles in the Shanghai-based Millard's Review even discussed the issue of the United States withdrawing from Far Eastern politics. Has the United States changed its policy towards the Pacific? Is it truly indifferent to the proposal for a non-aggression treaty for the Pacific coast? This question is very worthy of our attention at this moment when the situation in the Pacific is showing important developments.</p>
<p>We can observe this issue from two aspects. The first is the facilities that the United States has built in the Pacific in recent years. The second is the development of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States in recent years.</p>
<p>Regarding the first aspect, we have noticed that in recent years, although President Roosevelt has been preoccupied with dealing with domestic issues, he has not relaxed his efforts in expanding naval power in the Pacific and developing maritime transportation. Naval exercises near the Hawaiian Islands are expanding every year. The islands in the central Pacific have been assigned to the management of the Department of the Navy. The Pan American Company's trans-Pacific air route has been successful. It is now opening up air routes between Hawaii and Australia. Even in the Philippines, under the leadership of former U.S. Army Chief of Staff MacArthur, its defenses are being continuously strengthened. These facts prove one point, namely that although the United States does not explicitly express its opposition to Japan's aggression against our country, it is working hard to prepare to take a tough stance against the aggressor when necessary.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned "necessary time" is related to the United Kingdom's policy towards the Pacific. During the Stimson era, the United States, based on the positions of the Washington Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty, protested against Japan's aggression against our country. However, because the United Kingdom did not provide actual support, it was ineffective. Therefore, in recent years, the United Kingdom, because Japan's power has gradually developed to Central and Southern China, affecting its interests, has begun to take a firm stance. The United States has adopted a cautious wait-and-see attitude, not directly supporting it, but preferring to assist it from the side. Especially before the British Conservative government has shaken off its hesitant and ambiguous attitude, the U.S. diplomatic community is always calmly paying attention to its development and is unwilling to stand in front rashly. However, this does not mean that the United States will allow the natural development of the situation in the Pacific or abandon its intention to cooperate with the United Kingdom. During the war in Italy and Abyssinia, the United States secretly helped the United Kingdom. The United States has always maintained good relations with the British dominions. Recently, General Smuts of the Union of South Africa advocated at the Imperial Conference that the United Kingdom and the United States should cooperate to maintain world peace, which is a significant proof. Therefore, the United States is bound to sympathize with Australian Prime Minister Lyons' proposal for a non-aggression treaty for the Pacific coast. Its pointing out that the Nine-Power Treaty already exists in the Pacific is probably implying that the future conclusion of a non-aggression treaty should take safeguarding our country's territorial integrity and sovereign independence as the primary meaning.</p>
<h3>Britain Proposes Mediation in the Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>France, Belgium, and the Vatican Express Support; Rumors Suggest Italian Prime Minister Preparing to Withdraw Volunteer Soldiers</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources, the British government will soon consult with major European countries, preparing to suggest a cessation of military action to both sides of the Spanish Civil War. So far, responses from various countries indicate little hope for success. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain, diplomatic sources here recently stated that British envoys stationed in the capitals of countries that signed the Non-Intervention Agreement for the Spanish conflict have been instructed to inquire with the governments of their host countries whether they would jointly negotiate with both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War to facilitate the withdrawal of foreign volunteers after a "Truce Agreement" is established. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] Numerous newspapers here have commented on the news of the British government's proposal to mediate the Spanish Civil War to establish a ceasefire agreement. Le Journal des Débats reported that the governments of France, Belgium, and the Vatican have expressed their support. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, during a conversation with French Foreign Minister Delbos yesterday, also stated that Belgium is willing to find ways to promote ceasefire negotiations. However, the newspaper (referring to Le Journal des Débats itself) believes that it would be more appropriate for the London Adjustment Committee to handle the mediation. Le Petit Journal stated that when the League of Nations Council meets at the end of this month, the chief representative of Spain, Álvarez del Vayo, will likely use the pretext of preventing foreign interference in the civil war to propose the establishment of an investigation committee, which would become a mediation committee at an opportune time. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>⊙Beijing: Well-informed sources recently stated that regarding the Spanish Civil War issue, French Foreign Minister Delbos recently informed Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak of certain information. Reportedly, during his recent talks with British authorities in London, they agreed that the best way to withdraw foreign volunteers currently participating in the Spanish Civil War is to have both parties involved in the conflict temporarily cease hostilities. Britain is seeking opinions from related countries, especially the governments of Italy and Germany. The German government has reportedly already approved of this proposal. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>⊙Gibraltar: It is widely rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has hinted to General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, that he intends to withdraw all Italian troops from Spain. This has caused great anxiety among the Nationalist forces. It is said that Mussolini made this decision after receiving a report from a delegation representing the families of Italian soldiers fighting in Spain, stating that the Spanish war situation remains unchanged, with tens of thousands of foreign soldiers dying, a significant portion of whom are Italians. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>[Rome] There is currently no confirmation of the claim that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is preparing to withdraw Italian troops fighting in Spain. However, the complaints from parents and relatives of Italian volunteers regarding the Spanish war are an open secret. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council Meeting to Open Next Monday</h3>
<p>The Spanish government applies to include foreign interference in the Spanish Civil War on the agenda. The League of Nations Special Assembly is scheduled to convene on the 26th.</p>
<p>[Geneva] The 97th regular session of the League of Nations Council is now scheduled to open on the 24th of this month, presided over by the Ecuadorian representative, Dr. Quevedo. The Chinese government will be represented by its ambassador to France, Dr. Wellington Koo. In addition, British Foreign Secretary Eden, French Foreign Minister Delbos, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, Romanian Foreign Minister Stoyanesco, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Santacruz, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras, Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, and Latvian Foreign Minister Munters will also be in attendance. The agenda of the regular session includes the following items: ① The application submitted by the Spanish Republican government (i.e., requesting the Council to include the issue of foreign interference in the Spanish Civil War on the agenda); ② The future system of the Sanjak region (i.e., the cities of Alexandretta and Antioch) within the mandate territory of Syria; ③ The issue of international joint suppression of terrorism; ④ The issue of international relief for refugees; ⑤ The election of a successor to the Belgian judge at the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, Judge Jachymann, who passed away. Furthermore, the League of Nations Special Assembly is scheduled to convene on the 26th of this month to approve Egypt's admission as a member state of the League. The president of the assembly will be the Greek minister to France, Politis. The date for convening a meeting of the bureau of the Disarmament Conference has not yet been determined.

<h3>Spanish Government Sends Telegram to League of Nations</h3>
<p>Britain Considers It Inopportune</p>
<p>[Geneva] Spanish Republican Foreign Minister Giral recently sent a telegram to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, stating, "In the opinion of the Spanish government, foreign interference in the Spanish Civil War is increasing daily. The League of Nations Council held a special meeting in December of last year and discussed this issue. It is now appropriate to decide to continue this discussion." Avenol has decided to include this application from the Spanish Republican government on the agenda of the regular Council meeting. During the Council meeting, the chief representative of Spain, Álvarez del Vayo, will deliver a speech to explain the application. It is generally believed that the content of this speech will be largely the same as the speech Álvarez del Vayo gave at the special Council meeting in December of last year, only with a different presentation of the facts and no other demands, as the Spanish government apparently does not want to interfere with the work of the London Adjustment Committee. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] Diplomatic sources here believe that this application from the Spanish government is inappropriate. After the opening of the regular Council meeting, it is likely that a resolution will be passed to record the complaint submitted by the Spanish government and state that the issue of foreign interference in the Spanish Civil War should be handled exclusively by the London Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee. Official sources do not wish to comment on this matter, while political figures have expressed their disagreement with the Spanish government's view, stating that Germany and Italy are now cooperating with other countries within the Adjustment Committee regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The League of Nations should not take any action outside of the Adjustment Committee at this time, otherwise it may undermine the results achieved by the Adjustment Committee. Political figures also stated that the Spanish Republican government intended to submit a request to the League of Nations a month ago, but was dissuaded by the British side, so it was delayed until today.

<h3>Spanish Representative Takes White Paper to France En Route to Geneva</h3>
<p>⊙Valencia: The chief representative of Spain attending the League of Nations Council, former Foreign Minister Álvarez del Vayo, recently traveled by train to Paris en route to Geneva. He is carrying a white paper to be submitted to the Council for review. It is generally known that this white paper is a compilation of 101 documents, photographs, etc., seized from Italian prisoners by the Spanish government forces and recovered from the front lines in Guadalajara province after the retreat of Italian troops, serving as concrete evidence of Italy's armed interference in the Spanish Civil War.

<h3>British Imperial Conference</h3>
<p>Foreign Policy Speech; Eden Provides Supplementary Explanation</p>
<p>[London] The British Imperial Conference reconvened this afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Eden provided a supplementary explanation to the speech he delivered on Wednesday, broadly discussing Britain's policies in Central, Southern, and Eastern Europe. At the next meeting, representatives from the various Dominions are expected to express their opinions on the establishment of a commercial treaty between Britain and the United States. This treaty may have a significant impact on trade relations between the Dominions and the British mainland, as the Dominions primarily export raw materials to Britain. If the United States establishes a commercial treaty with Britain, its exports to Britain will also be primarily raw materials, which would conflict with the interests of the Dominions.

<h3>British King's Naval Review; A Spectacle at Sea</h3>
<p>Ships Aligned in a Row Twelve Miles Long; Nighttime Lights Illuminate as if Day</p>
<p>[London] After the British Navy was reviewed by the King at Spithead this afternoon, the ships were illuminated with lights this evening, creating a brilliant display. The audience gathered in the Southsea area in numbers unprecedented in Portsmouth's history, vying for high vantage points along the coast to watch. The electric lights on the royal yacht shone brightly, as dense as stars. The King and Queen hosted a banquet for senior officers from both the Home Fleet and the Mediterranean Fleet. Afterwards, the King and Queen went on deck, enjoying the magnificent scene. At 11:30 PM, red, white, and green fireworks were launched from the royal yacht. Shortly after, all the ship lights went out, and then, within seconds, the fleet's searchlights projected white beams, dancing in the sky, creating another spectacle. The King's review began at 3 PM. The royal yacht went first, followed by five large ships carrying guests from various countries. Finally, there were six more ships filled with government officials, proceeding in an orderly fashion through the review area, which was twelve miles long. Sailors lined the decks of each ship, wearing blue and white uniforms, and saluted with rifles as the royal yacht approached. The King stood at the bow of the yacht, returning their salutes, while the Queen and other members of the royal family gathered on the bridge. After the review was completed at 5 PM, the royal yacht docked in front of the fleet, and naval aircraft then took off in formation, soaring above the royal yacht to show their respect. Tourist boats were allowed to dock along the route taken by the royal yacht, so many people boarded boats to view the warships up close. The Navy Department granted special privileges to film companies, allowing them to film freely. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>⊙Portsmouth Harbour: King George VI visited the flagships this morning and inspected the battleships HMS Nelson and HMS Rodney (both 33,500 tons), HMS Queen Elizabeth (31,000 tons), the light cruiser HMS Dunedin (4,850 tons), and the newest cruiser HMS Southampton (9,000 tons). He was particularly interested in the Southampton, which is equipped with many six-inch guns, with three guns on each turret. In addition, the seaplane facilities were also new and innovative. King George VI is scheduled to return to London with the Queen this afternoon. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Former King Prepares for Wedding</h3>
<p>To Invite French Pastor to Officiate</p>
<p>⊙Monts, France: It is learned today that the former King Edward VIII, the Duke of Windsor, and Mrs. Wallis Simpson will have a religious wedding ceremony and a civil ceremony. The officiating pastor will be selected from the Church of England. After the Duke and Mrs. Simpson marry, they will first honeymoon on a yacht in the Mediterranean, and then reside at Château de Candé in France. The Duke visited Pastor Andéol of the Tours Christian Church today, and it is expected that he will invite a French pastor to officiate the wedding, so as not to conflict with the Archbishop of Canterbury again, as the wedding officiated by a French pastor does not require the approval of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

<h3>Japan Exhausting Resources; Plans to Issue Military Bonds</h3>
<p>Issuing 30 Million Yuan Annually; Exploiting the Lower Middle Class</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to news today, the Ministry of Finance has decided to issue bonds similar to war bonds starting this year. The Japanese name is "Premium Savings Bonds." The face value of each bond is ten yen, and the price is not marked on the bond. The annual issuance will be tentatively 30 million Japanese yen. The formal bill for issuing these bonds is currently being drafted and will be submitted to the special session of the Diet. The nature of these bonds is exactly the same as the "Patriotic Bonds" issued by the belligerent countries during World War I. Japan's frenzied expansion of armaments has almost exhausted the surplus funds in Japan. The recent issuance of ordinary deficit government bonds has also encountered serious difficulties. Therefore, the burden of preparing for war is now directly shifted to the shoulders of small consumers. The bond unit is extremely small, equivalent to postal savings and government savings. The issuance of these bonds, if not for the purpose of mobilizing the limited reserves of the general public, is not of ordinary significance. People still recall the issuance of similar bonds in 1904, the purpose of which was to raise funds for the Russo-Japanese War. After the great earthquake in 1924, these bonds were issued for construction work, and these bonds were also issued after the September 18th Incident. (Central News Agency, 21st)</p>

The upcoming Japanese consular meeting in North China is also being given great importance by the newspapers. (Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japan's Showa Society Voluntarily Dissolves</h3>
<p>The Only Government-Affiliated Party</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Showa Society, the only government-affiliated party in the Japanese Diet, today announced the dissolution of the party by its leader, Keisuke Mochizuki, and a formal voluntary dissolution will take place soon. The Showa Society suffered its first blow at the end of last year when the creator of the party, former Railway Minister Shinya Uchida, was imprisoned for bribery. The second blow was the departure of Tatsunosuke Yamazaki from the party to join the Hayashi Cabinet. However, the fatal blow was the recent general election results, which reduced the number of seats held by the party in the Diet by five compared to the previous election. However, those involved with the Showa Society claim that this voluntary dissolution is intended to cede ground to create a new party, but most people believe that this action is actually a failure of the government to create a new party and a setback for the government's struggle against the Seiyukai and Minseito parties.

<h3>Former Governor-General of Vietnam Discusses Impressions of Travel in China</h3>
<p>China Has Completed Unification; The Future Is Limitless</p>
<p>[Paris] Former Governor-General of Vietnam and a prominent member of the French Socialist Party, Pierre Pasquier, recently traveled to China and Japan for inspection. When he passed through Shanghai, he made a statement to the Shanghai correspondent of the "International Tribune," saying, "The China, which the world calls a place rampant with bandits, no longer exists. What has risen in its place is a new China, which is about to become one of the world powers and an important factor for world peace. The speed of this development is astonishing. The tremendous efforts made by the country's authorities in politics and economy have left me in admiration. The people in the Nanjing government have been working hard to promote unification for several years. Although they have encountered obstacles that are difficult to overcome, their achievements have been great." Pasquier then recounted his impressions of southern China, namely the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan, where foreign visitors are rare. "The local authorities are now actively building roads, opening schools, and launching regular air routes between major cities to connect them. As far as the political and economic relations between China and France are concerned, I firmly believe that they will become increasingly developed, because there is no reason for separation between the two sides. On the contrary, there are many factors that bring them closer together, such as the mutual love of peace, cultural similarities, and the willingness to work and progress. As soon as I return to France, I will do my best to introduce China's great construction work to the French people so that the French people's sympathy for China and the Chinese people will become more and more profound."

<p>[London] General Evangeline Booth, commander of the Salvation Army worldwide, today ordered the dismissal of Commissioner Mapp, who has served as the Salvation Army Chief of Staff since 1929. The tribunal organized by five Salvation Army commissioners submitted a unanimous report that was unfavorable to Mapp, so General Booth resolutely issued the dismissal order. Mapp has served in the Salvation Army for 50 years, having served as a Salvation Army officer in India, Ceylon, and London. He was then promoted to administrative positions in Britain and Canada, appointed commander of the Salvation Army in South America, then commander in Japan, and finally went to Russia to establish the Salvation Army's work. Before long, he was appointed as the Salvation Army's International Secretary. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Operate Air Route Between Tokyo, Changchun, and Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The timetable and fares for the Japan-Manchukuo-North China connecting air express, which will begin on June 1, have now been officially decided. The fares for the entire route will be reduced on that day. The air travel expenses will be cheaper than the first-class train fare and slightly more expensive than the second-class train fare. For example, the Tokyo-Changchun route, the Tokyo-Dalian route, and the Tokyo-Taipei route will only cost 165 yuan and 151 yuan respectively by AT passenger plane. (The Huitong Company line connects with it, from Tokyo to Tianjin is 203 yuan), and 175 yuan, prices are the same as the usual airfare prices in the past. Generally speaking, these airfare prices are the new prices reduced from the express fee (approximately 5 yuan per 500 kilometers). As for the arrival and departure times of the express planes, before July, including Changchun and Dalian, they are scheduled for once every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. From the 8th and 1st, it will be changed to round trip every day. The one-way trip from Tokyo to Changchun and Tianjin is shortened to 10 hours, and to Taipei it is shortened to 9 and a half hours.</p>
<p>The express flight schedule is as follows: Tokyo-Changchun route (downward), Tokyo departure, 7:20 AM, arrival Changchun, 5:05 PM, (upward) Changchun departure, 7:20 AM, arrival Tokyo, 5:00 PM, Tokyo-Tianjin route (connected to the Seoul and Changchun lines), (downward) Seoul departure, 1:35 PM, arrival Tianjin, 5:10 PM, (upward) Tianjin departure, 7:10 AM, arrival Seoul, 10:45 AM, (The Taipei line and other lines remain the same) (Domei News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>The Secret Rivalry Between England and Japan Over Siam (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>The Kra Canal Remains the Focus of Attention</p>
<p>The purchasing power of the Siamese people is very low, partly due to autocratic and corrupt governance. As a result, inexpensive Japanese goods are highly appealing to the Siamese. In 1933, Japanese exports to Siam were valued at 18 million Japanese yen. By 1935, this had increased to 40 million yen, and further increases were seen in 1936. Before 1931, no Japanese ships regularly sailed to Siam. Today, Mitsui &amp; Co. has built four new 6,000-ton high-speed diesel-powered ships, and Osaka Shosen Kaisha has one ship, all operating between Japan and Bangkok, with departures every two weeks. Due to the extraordinary development of shipping, both companies increased freight rates by 10% from December 1, 1935. As for British exports to Siam, particularly from Lancashire, the following figures demonstrate that they are gradually being taken over by the Japanese. From 1933 to 1934, goods shipped from Singapore, including those from England, were valued at 13.5 million Baht (Siamese currency, with each Baht worth approximately 45 US cents). During that year, Japanese goods shipped to Siam were valued at 14.6 million Baht. By 1934 to 1935, the British figure was 25.4 million, while the Japanese figure had increased to 21.1 million. Of the Japanese goods shipped to Siam, cotton textiles accounted for 65%. On March 21, 1936, the Siamese government announced new tariffs, reducing various tax rates.</p>
<p>Although Japan still maintains a large trade surplus with Siam (in 1935, Siamese exports to Japan were valued at 5.5 million Japanese yen), Siam is currently developing its natural resources such as rubber, tin, and grapefruit on a large scale, so there is hope of offsetting the import surplus. Recently, several Japanese cotton industry experts arrived in Siam, and the Siamese government is currently hiring a Japanese professor of agricultural economics. In the past four years, Siam's cotton production has tripled. In 1919, there were only 285 Japanese residents in Siam. By 1929, this had increased by 10%, and according to Japanese estimates, there are now as many as 1,000. However, these Japanese residents are not long-term residents; most are employees of Japanese trading companies. Japan has never regarded Siam as a possible outlet for surplus population.</p>
<p>What purpose does Japan have in placing so much emphasis on amicable relations with Siam? If we know that Siamese naval officers and officer candidates are being trained on Japanese warships, that Siamese military officers are no longer entering European military academies but instead are entering Japanese military academies, and that the Japanese budget includes funding for an air route between Tokyo and Bangkok, who can believe that the close cooperation between Japan and Siam is solely for economic reasons? It is said that Rear Admiral Ohno, recently appointed as the Japanese naval commissioner in Bangkok, stated, "Many people in Siam advocate for the establishment of an Asian alliance with Japan as its leader." The British were quite shocked to hear this news, which came just before the Japanese commercial delegation was about to visit Siam. After the commercial delegation succeeded in Siam, Siamese Foreign Minister Marutham felt that the growing anxiety abroad was unfavorable to Siam. Therefore, just as the Japanese delegation was leaving Siam, he issued statements to reassure people, denying that Siam advocated using one country to control another, and emphatically stated that the friendly financial relations between Siam and England remained unchanged. The British political circles were naturally satisfied and interested to read these statements, but they lacked one thing: the Kra Canal project, which was causing concern on Downing Street.</p>
<p>Because England senses that Japan has the ambition to cut off Singapore's throat, it is urgently trying to maintain the balance of power on the Kra Isthmus. It is said that they are currently considering revising the treaty relations between England and Siam, but it may be too late. Japan's Pan-Asianism and calls for Buddhist solidarity may ultimately prevail over the British financial advisors. Siam's commanding military-strategic importance in the rule of Southeast Asia, has never been more obvious than it is today. The Japan-Germany Pact, it is said, also contains secret clauses, with the aim of including the Dutch East Indies within the sphere of influence of Japan and Germany, which is sufficient to explain Japan's tendency to advance and expand its power southward. If Japan gains a foothold in Siam, it will have superior convenience, both to take the Dutch East Indies and to attack and shelter Singapore from the rear. But Siam's true relationship regarding the canal project is one that it itself can clarify. It is deeply regrettable that the peace and neutrality plan advocated by Siamese Prime Minister Phraya has had no opportunity to be realized. The Kra Canal project can be regarded as one of the most reasonable plans ever proposed to facilitate world trade and transportation. It should not be allowed to be hindered by political jealousy. There is a question that must be asked: is it right for England to pursue a policy of not opening a new door, but instead of preventing it? The understanding between Germany and Japan in this matter may reveal a new reason. Originally, Phraya was a graduate of the Prussian Military Academy and was a classmate of General Göring. A situation may arise in the future where the major powers unite and forcibly open this new door, disregarding England. As for the current power of Western countries, it may still be able to resist Japan's prestige, but England has taken precautions in advance, and is currently spending millions of dollars to repair the defenses of Singapore.

<h3>United States Strengthens Defenses Along the Pacific Coast</h3>
<p>Swanson's Letter to the House Naval Affairs Committee Acknowledges the Need to Establish Additional Air Stations</p>
<p>[Washington] According to a letter from US Secretary of the Navy Claude Swanson to the House Naval Affairs Committee, the US Navy does not need new air force bases in the Atlantic, but there is an urgent need to increase air station facilities and improve equipment along the Pacific coast. Swanson's letter was written in response to a resolution introduced by Republican Congressman Brewster. Swanson also stated that existing extensive naval bases, including Alameda, California, if fully developed, would be sufficient to handle all naval aircraft, whether the US Navy is based in the Atlantic or the Pacific. However, the needs of the Pacific coast are indeed very urgent. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)</p>

<h3>International Theft Discovered in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Specializing in Stealing Copper and Iron from Residents' Doors Increased Prawn Prices Due to Purchase by a Certain Country</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence Over the years, North China has become a free trade market. Various countries obtain the goods they lack from this place. Many people come here to purchase copper, iron, and other items. Since last winter, an export company commissioned by the United States has come to buy, and England has also sent people to procure. A certain country in the East purchases even more enthusiastically. In the past, scrap copper and iron, which no one cared about and were worthless, have become excellent raw materials in the past six months. Buyers naturally want as much as possible, but since North China has no copper or iron mines and relies solely on private savings, the quantity is ultimately limited. Therefore, after buying for so long, not only are the savings in cities and villages becoming tight, but also the stockpiles in the cities are almost exhausted. Recently, a certain country has paid more attention to copper coins and has been buying and smuggling them out of the country in large quantities, causing a copper coin shortage in North China. However, in the past week, a group of international thieves has suddenly appeared in Tianjin. It is rumored that the leader is from a certain country, and the internal organization is very strict, with no less than fifty accomplices. This group of thieves does not steal gold or silver, but specializes in stealing copper and iron utensils from residents in the city. The method they use is not "burglary," but outright thievery. They specialize in stealing iron rivets or copper studs and animal rings from the gates of various residents. They work mostly at night, so few people know about it, and the stolen householders lose unimportant objects outside the door, often losing them for a long time, they still don't know. It is said that this group started in the Japanese Concession and has gradually stolen to other concessions. The stolen items accumulate and are sold to export trading companies. At this time of copper and iron famine, the price obtained is very considerable. The authorities of the Japanese Concession have now detected this matter and have specially dispatched detectives to form a patrol team to patrol secluded streets and alleys every night to solve the case.</p>
<p>The "economic aggression" of a certain country in recent years has become more active. Even the prawns produced along the coast of North China (called Korean shrimp or Taisho shrimp in Japanese) have been subjected to its aggression and monopolized. It is rumored that a certain country is rampant in purchasing prawns in the production areas, causing the price of prawns this year to increase suddenly to five or six times the original price. Sometimes there is no place to buy them. The prawn production areas are mostly in Changli, Qinhuangdao, and Luhekou in the Bohai Bay. Every year, they are sold in North China markets. Tianjin has always been the distribution center. From April to May, the goods are abundant, and the price is the cheapest, only selling for one fen and seven or eight li per pair. One jiao of foreign silver can buy six or seven pairs. Since a certain country took a fancy to this thing last year, thinking that it is the richest in vitamins and proteins, if it is made into refrigerated canned food or dried, it is the most suitable for military use in times of emergency. Therefore, it started to purchase in large quantities in the Changluo area. Last season, it purchased more than 300,000 yuan worth, which led to a sharp reduction in the quantity transported to North China. However, last year, even at the cheapest time, one jiao of foreign silver could buy two pairs. The current situation is becoming more and more tense. Since the beginning of spring, a certain country has sent people to sit and collect in Changluo. All catches, no matter how much, are bought. Everything produced along the coast, from Qingwei in the south to Qinyu in the north, is bought up. Even now, in the middle of the peak season, the price is still about two jiao per pair. The cheapest is also one jiao and six or seven fen, then you can buy a pair. Restaurants and hotels that should be cooking and frying shrimp in season often answer customers that they are sold out or have no materials. This is simply an unexpected thing. The economic aggression of a certain country can be said to be all-encompassing.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Recently Adjusts Food Supply for the People</h3>
<p>Tax-Free Foreign Rice Imported for a Limited Time</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence Although the Guangdong provincial government has recently allowed the import of 4 million dan of Thai rice tax-free to remedy the shortage of local rice, the 4 million dan of rice is imported into the interior in installments, and the monthly income is limited. Therefore, the market has not been able to sell large quantities of rice, and the rice price has not fallen sharply in recent months. On average, only eight catties of rice can be purchased per yuan. The People's Food Regulation Association believes that this situation has not achieved the purpose of relieving the people's food. In addition to sending people to various places to investigate the reason for the failure of rice prices to fall, it also sent personnel to Hong Kong to discuss solutions with rice merchants to stabilize prices, and declared the Guangdong government's purpose of relieving the people's food. Hong Kong overseas Chinese and rice merchants immediately presented a plan to solve the food shortage, which roughly stated that "Guangdong's food supply is at a time when the green and yellow are not connected, and the source of rice is about to be cut off. The rice stored in neighboring provinces is only more than 60,000 bags. Although the number of foreign rice exempted from tax is limited, due to the relationship of obtaining certificates, the procedures are difficult, resulting in a limited number of foreign rice transported from Hong Kong to the province recently. To supply Guangzhou City, it may still be difficult to cope. However, the whole province is large, and there are many areas in urgent need of relief. With the current limited sources, how can relief be popularized? Therefore, I earnestly request that the remaining amount of the 4 million dan of rice exempted from tax previously determined by the central government, except for the amount that has already been imported, be allowed to be transported according to the half-tax import method within the shortest possible time, which can not only save the current crisis, but also a large amount of foreign rice imported, and the rice price will naturally fall sharply. There are currently 170,000 bags of white rice and 500,000 to 600,000 bags of foreign grain in Hong Kong, but because it is necessary to obtain certificates, it cannot be supplied continuously. If approved, it can be violated in an instant, and the suffering of rice shortage can be slightly reduced." After the officer reported the situation, he promised to ask the authorities to handle it, and then returned to the province to report to the authorities. On the 17th, he gathered more than ten people, including representatives of miscellaneous grain guilds, rice bran distribution guilds, rice machinery industry guilds, rice industry guilds, and people's food councils, in the Food Regulation Association to discuss together. Finally, it was decided that the foreign rice registered for import this month should be imported on a regular basis, and should not be delayed, which would affect the rice price. It was also stipulated that the foreign rice registered by the Guangzhou Kowloon, Jiangmen, Gongbei, and Haikou customs should be transported in within five days, and the foreign rice from Leizhou and Shantou customs should be transported in on the 27th of this month, hoping that a large amount of foreign rice would be transported in within a short period of time to stabilize the low rice price, so that the lives of the poor could be slightly relieved.

<h3>Gleanings from Yunnan Journey (14)</h3>
<p>— Bai Juan</p>
<p>At noon, Inspector Ren Ziqing invited me to a banquet. Ren repeatedly stated the drought in Guizhou Province and the epidemic in Sipu, hoping that the central government would issue funds for relief, but there was no corresponding result at the time. In the afternoon, Director Zhang Banghan of the Construction Office held a tea party. Zhang has solutions for construction. Director Miao Jiaming reported on ten economic construction projects. Miao is a graduate of the United States and has worked in Yunnan's finances. What he talked about was very systematic. Later, I went to the "Haiyuan Temple". The temple is solemn, and there is nothing to record. I went up the mountain for about ten miles to Qiongzhu and other places. The temple is inhabited by monks. The five hundred Arhats have different postures. Compared with Lingyin Temple in West Lake, Guiyuan Temple in Hanyang, Baosheng Temple in Yuzhi, Xiyuan in Suzhou, Dajue Temple in Chengdu, and Biyun Temple in Beiping, the expressions of the various Han halls are completely different. Similar to the Arhats in Mount Emei, or made by Sichuan sculptors. Army Commander Hao Mengling and various artists all praised it. Chairman Long told me that there was an Italian among the five hundred Arhats. A certain teacher considered it, and it had a high nose and deep eyes, which was different from the others. Also, the image of Sakyamuni has a prism-colored skin, which is the same as the temples in Calcutta and Lhasa. The province of Yunnan is adjacent to Sichuan and Tibet, which is the sculpting method of the Heavenly Kingdom. I know that the Arhats sculpted in other states are of the Buddha family such as Yungang Longmen, which are descendants of Egyptian sculpting techniques.</p>
<p>After going down the mountain, the Kunming Go Club hosted us. I played against Mr. He Xingfu, giving him three stones, but I still lost to He. Mr. He's Go skill is known as one of the best in the country. That afternoon, the French Consul General Kang Dong held a banquet for Chief Chu, which was for social purposes and did not discuss official business. Kunming has four consulates: France, England, the United States, and Japan. HeKou has a branch of the French consulate, and Tengyue has a consulate. Simao and Mengbai originally had French consulates, but they have now been abolished. The German and Italian consulates in Kunming were also abolished earlier. Kunming is a self-opening commercial port. Mengzi, Simao, Hekou, and Tengyue are land commercial ports. There are more than 5,000 Annamites along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, most of whom have no licenses. Some of them are licensed. The license is co-signed by China and France. Those without licenses are mostly Vietnamese revolutionaries who are unwilling to be licensed by France. There is a Vietnamese Revolutionary Party in Yunnan, and the members are extremely mixed. There are also many criminals who are afraid of being arrested and join the party. Therefore, there have been as many as nine assassination cases of Vietnamese in China in recent years. The Yunnan government once shot a Vietnamese criminal. Also, in recent years, the French consul has always asked the Chinese authorities to extradite Vietnamese revolutionaries and communists. Those in power are able to send them away, and if they cannot be sent away, they will detain and extradite them. They both abide by international ethics and abide by treaties. The Vietnamese Revolutionary Party in Yunnan was initially guided by members of our country's provincial party headquarters, but because the members were complicated, we stopped guiding them.</p>
<p>Regarding the recent Sino-British southern section of the boundary survey, both parties have exchanged views on the survey materials and believe that they can be used as the basis for the final boundary conference in Nanjing. It is by no means the so-called signing. Now, the members of both parties, Liang Zigao, etc., have left Minghong and are returning to the province one after another. If they stay in Simao for about two weeks, they can go to Kunming. A measuring team has already been sent to Hong Kong first. The work done by both parties this time can only be called the end of the survey materials. It cannot be said that it has been resolved and signed, because the final decision must be decided by the capital conference. The League of Nations neutral committee warned both parties not to make irresponsible propaganda before the decision. According to those familiar with the boundary affairs, this case concerns the affiliation of Ban Hong and the dispute in Ximeng. Whether the joint investigation report prepared by both parties this time has any decisions on these two points or how to retain them is a matter of great concern to the people. I think there will be public news to listen to soon.</p>
<p>In the evening, Commander Ma Cong and others invited me to a banquet. At the banquet, they coaxed Zhou Zhongyue, the provincial committee member. Zhou was a powerful worker in the Protectorate War, helping Mr. Songpo to overthrow Yuan. I also met the head of Mengzi, talking about Yunnan education in detail. Everyone asked He Sui and Zheng Yue to write, and they all wielded their pens. The guests were happy. A longevity screen of Ma's mother hung on the wall. All the Yunnan generals signed their names. At that time, Zhu De was the commander of the military police, so he was also listed in the following paragraph.</p>
<p>On the twenty-ninth day (May 3), I met with the special commissioner of the foreign affairs office, talking about that there are no pending cases between China and France. The friendship between the two countries has returned to normal since the signing of the Vietnam border treaty. The former Vietnam Governor, the current representative of the Vietnamese people, the French citizen Huaerlun, recently came to Yunnan to briefly discuss the material procurement contract for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. China and France have already signed it. In the future, if the Guizhou-Yunnan Railway is successful, why not connect it with the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway for joint transportation, so that it can reach the seaport of Vietnam? It can be seen that French people are paying attention to the Guizhou-Yunnan Railway.</p>
<p>We originally planned to leave on the 5th. Chairman Long telegraphed to Beijing to stay for two more days. Some of the companions missed their hometowns, and some had not finished their tour. Chu Fengchang proposed that the members of the delegation should vote on whether to stay or leave. The results were half and half. Mr. Shen Yuanming was rich in meeting experience and said, "The secretaries are of a transcendent nature and should not be included in the members to vote." So the secretaries withdrew, and the majority who advocated staying became the majority. So it was decided to extend it for two days. Mr. Chu and others can go to Hekou to meet with the border defense Supervisor Chen. The rest can go to Yiliang for a tour, to see the bridge and tunnel engineering of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Soon the Qingzhen Temple welcomed Mr. Chu and Mr. Wang Zengshan, with thousands of people present. There are more than 10,000 Muslim households in Kunming City, and they have a high status in the military and political circles. Chu talked about cleanliness and sports, which was in line with the sympathy of Islam. Mr. Wang gave a lecture on the classics and the sacred instructions, combined with the Three People's Principles, the New Life Movement, and the development of popular education, which greatly moved the audience. Soon, Tang Jiyu, the principal of the military sub-school, held a banquet at his house. The garden is named "East Land." The American consulate rented part of its consulate. Chairman Long, Zhou Zhongyue, Lu Han, and Hao Mengling were present at the banquet. They talked about the history of Liang Yu who fought against Kublai Khan in Yunnan at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, and the stories of Wu Yizhu and Chen Yuanyuan at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Someone said that the number of nunneries in Guizhou and Yunnan is said to be because after Wu Sangui was killed, Chen Yuanyuan distributed his property to the concubines, ordering them to build more than 20 nunneries and shave their hair to practice. Chen Yuanyuan died after Wu. Someone said that there are no aborigines in Yunnan. Since the ninth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, 40,000 large households from Jiangnan were moved to Yunnan, and the population began to prosper. Most of the Yunnan people are from Nanjing, and all the buildings are similar to the Jiangnan style. Jin said that today the central government has set its capital in Nanjing. This inspection tour came from Beijing, which is like sending a group of children to recognize their old relatives, so the emotions are more cordial. A gentleman said that since Nanjing was set as the capital, our Yunnan general public, with historical and blood ties, has every natural good feeling. Now that the road transportation has improved, it can be reached directly within ten days. In the future, there will be more opportunities to see the old patriarch.</p>
<h3>Active Consolidation of Chaoshan Finance</h3>
<p>Commercial Warehouse Securities to Be Recalled and Closed by Deadline Major Banks Plan to Rescue the Market</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence The amount of commercial warehouse securities circulating in the Shantou market is 9 million yuan. Although the face value is written in silver dollars, it is about one-tenth lower than the value of the central legal tender. It can be used in Shantou City, but it is not very circulated in Chaozhou and Meizhou. However, the currency in the Shantou market is complex, including silver dollar notes issued by provincial banks, silver dollar notes issued by central banks, Chinese banks, legal tender, paper money guaranteed by merchants and silver houses, circulating notes, county copper yuan notes, and cash and silver coins are also very commonly used. Commercial warehouse securities account for the largest force in various common currencies. Domestic and foreign drafts, once they arrive in Chaoshan, are settled using commercial warehouse coupons. The people must go through a discount when buying and selling. The price in the market store must first ask what kind of currency the customer uses for trading. The bank also asks what kind of silver you want to take when exchanging drafts, and then uses an abacus to calculate it. Anyone who comes to Chaoshan feels that the losses of the people and the disorder of the market finance are difficult. The market price of various currencies is different from morning to night, and everyone can suffer losses at any time. In order to maintain a unified currency, the central government ordered the Finance Department of Shantou to order the Shantou Commercial Warehouse Committee to recover 10% per month from March, and recover all 9 million yuan within ten months and close it down. The ticket holders of the commercial bonds have held meetings to oppose this, making excuses for the depletion of funds, and earnestly request to postpone it for two years before implementing the closure. At that time, the Finance Department disapproved it and ordered that it should still be handled according to the original order from April and be closed on schedule. After February next year, it will not be allowed to circulate and exercise in the market. After receiving the order, the Commercial Warehouse Association notified the ticket holders to handle it in accordance with it, recovering 10% per month from May and clearing it in ten months. At this moment, each ticket holder must look for cash to redeem the warehouse coupons. If the ticket holders cannot recover 10% per month, the guaranteed property of the household will be transferred to the custody of the Warehouse Committee. The ticket holders can no longer collect rent. If it exceeds two months, and it cannot be recovered according to the quota, all the properties will be sold publicly, and the money will be recovered for the warehouse coupons received from the Commercial Warehouse Association. If the property is sold and the amount is insufficient, the ticket holders will still be chased for payment. However, the chips recovered from the market by warehouse coupons are thus reduced, and the silver roots suddenly become tense, resulting in a surge in daily interest rates. Each ticket holder has entrusted intermediaries to sell property and land, but there are very few buyers, and the land price has also fallen. The banks of China, Transportation, and Provinces are now preparing to jointly organize a lending office in order to rescue the market, preparing 9 million yuan in legal tender. If the merchants are willing to mortgage their real estate to the bank, after the bank occupies the price, the money can be released, intending to fill the amount of the commercial warehouse coupons with 9 million yuan in legal tender, so that the finance will not be affected by it.</p>

<p>Power Plant Plans to Purchase Electricity from Outside</p>
<p>The county's electricity company has a capital of 350,000 yuan and serves approximately 4,000 households. Recently, electricity has been supplied to various rural areas to implement rural electrification. Some electricity in Taicang is also supplied by the county's power plant. However, the company's original generators can only supply just over 1,100 kilowatts of electricity. The urban area already uses more than 800 degrees. In the future, there may be a shortage for the development of the northwest line. The company plans to purchase new generators but has not yet obtained approval from the Construction Committee. It is considering purchasing electricity from the Qishuyan Power Plant or Suzhou. Negotiations are currently underway.</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Kong Spoke with Xu Kan and Others Yesterday</h3>
<p>Inquiring about the situation of domestic finance and disaster relief</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, spoke by wireless telephone with his eldest son, Ling Kan, in Shanghai at 8:00 PM last night in London, England.

<h3>Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association Telegrams President</h3>
<p>Report on the distribution of relief funds. Although Mr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, was specially dispatched by the central government to London to attend the coronation ceremony of King George VI of England, he was extremely concerned about the disasters in the country. He recently heard that the disasters in Sichuan, Guizhou, Henan, and Gansu provinces were serious, so he telegraphed Xu, the Deputy Minister of Finance, to consult with the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to borrow 300,000 yuan first to handle emergency relief. The association held a meeting the day before yesterday to allocate the funds. The association also sent a telegram to Mr. Kong reporting the distribution situation to relieve his concerns. The original telegram stated: "President Kong, your excellency: Xu, the Deputy Minister of Finance, has conveyed your original telegram, showing your concern for the disaster victims, and we are deeply grateful. Today's meeting has resolved that, because the association has already donated 40,000 yuan for the Henan disaster and borrowed 40,000 yuan from Jincheng and other four banks, it has been decided to allocate another 20,000 yuan from this loan. The remaining amount will be allocated as follows: 140,000 yuan to Sichuan, 110,000 yuan to Guizhou, 20,000 yuan to Gansu, and 10,000 yuan to Shaanxi. We hereby report this by telegram.

<h3>Pudong Fellow Townsmen Ask Du to Transfer Funds to Build a Dyke</h3>
<p>Building a stone dyke is an urgent matter, and the benefits are long-lasting; the Water Conservancy Council decides to request labor</p>
<p>Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association supervisors Qin Yanqi, director Fu Zuoheng, etc., plan to ask Chairman Du Yuesheng to transfer the funds collected for his birthday celebration to build a coastal stone dyke to protect farmland and benefit the people. Their proposal states: "Pudong is coastal, and the protection of farmland relies solely on the dykes. Starting from the Jiangzhe border marker in Jinshan County in the west and reaching the Shangxian border marker in Chuansha County in the north, the total length is 32,963 zhang. Only the Chongque area of Songjiang County built a stone dyke of 1,868 zhang in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. The rest are all earth dykes. The people compete with the water for land. Whenever there are hurricanes and rainstorms, they guard and block day and night. If the dyke body has any cracks, they immediately fill it with earth. Fortunately, if the wind and rain subside and the tide does not rise, they can celebrate their rebirth. Otherwise, once a breach occurs, tens of miles will be flooded, and life and property will be lost to the east. The farmers rely on the dyke as their lifeblood." During the prosperous times of the Qing Dynasty, materials were abundant, and officials and gentry were honest, and the construction was solid and reliable. The people celebrated their security. In the past fifty years, public and private finances have been difficult, and annual repairs have been insufficient to thicken and heighten them. As in the 31st year of Guangxu, and recently as in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Nanwei dyke body collapsed, washing away houses and submerging cotton and rice. The small people were displaced and miserable to see. Thus, there are expenses for emergency relief, winter relief, and spring relief. Finally, the expenses for repairing dykes and building embankments are even greater. The scale of the tomb donation covers the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the amount of loss is almost incalculable. However, the stone dyke of Chongque has remained motionless for three hundred years. Therefore, the permanent plan for our Pudong is to build a stone dyke, but the cost is very high, not less than tens of millions of yuan. It seems appropriate to select the dangerous places and conduct a pilot project first. It is found that the outer beach south of the first regiment of Nanhui is wide and the sea tide cannot invade the dyke body. However, north of the second regiment, the tide is fierce and rapid. The Wanggong dyke built in the tenth year of Guangxu has almost completely collapsed. It seems appropriate to build a stone dyke first between the second and third regiments, as well as in the former Baoshan County, which is now part of Shanghai, such as Chuanbao Jiaosi. Because the importance of this sea dyke is not only in Pudong, if fundamental measures are not taken, the sea tide will overflow, and the earth dyke will lose its protection. I am afraid that Shanghai, which is now the economic center of the country, will also become a swamp, and the loss will be incalculable. This year, we are happy to celebrate the 50th birthday of Mr. Du, the chairman of this association. Various parties are raising funds for construction to create a permanent memorial. I humbly believe that schools and hospitals are not as urgent and long-lasting as building a dyke. Moreover, Mr. Du is also concerned about this and has repeatedly urged the government to repair the dyke. Therefore, the establishment of the stone dyke is also based on Mr. Du's usual aspirations. Can the resolution of this meeting be to publicly request Mr. Du to use the funds collected for his birthday celebration to build a stone dyke? In the future, for Mr. Du's 60th, 70th, and 80th birthdays, and even countless birthdays, the birthday funds will be used to build the Pudong stone dyke so that the people of Pudong can live and work in peace and be able to contribute their surplus energy to meet the needs of society. Then Mr. Du's kindness will not only benefit Pudong. Is it appropriate? Please make a public decision." It was decided at the joint meeting of supervisors on May 20th to send a letter to Chairman Du and the directors, following public opinion.</p>

<h3>Haiyuan Steamer Ran Aground on Reef En Route from Hong Kong to Guangdong Yesterday</h3>
<p>The ship's body was high on the reef; all passengers were rescued</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Bureau's Haiyuan steamer ran aground on a reef yesterday at 4:00 a.m. en route from Hong Kong to Guangdong in the Kap Sin Men Lighthouse area. The pilot dispatched by the Hong Kong Pilots Association ran it aground to avoid colliding with a small steamer. The Haiyuan's first and second holds had some water coming in, but the ship was handled properly, and all passengers were safe. After the Shanghai headquarters received telegrams from the ship's captain, Norwegian Mr. Johansen, they reported the information to the insurance department of the Central Trust Bureau, which insured the ship, and telegraphed the Hong Kong branch and the captain to take immediate action nearby. If necessary, engineer Zhang Yao and captain Li Yunqu will be dispatched today, along with personnel from the Central Trust Bureau, to go to the scene to handle the matter.</p>
<p>This newspaper's Hong Kong special dispatch on the 21st reported that the China Merchants Bureau's Haiyuan steamer arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai on the 16th. At 4:50 a.m. on the 21st, it departed for Guangdong. At Jishui Men, it ran aground on a reef to avoid a small steamer. Passengers were awakened from their dreams, creating an unusual state of panic. Fortunately, the Taikoo Company's Yunnan steamer arrived from Guangdong and assisted in the rescue. The Haiyuan lowered five lifeboats, and the Yunnan one, rescuing a total of 180 passengers and carrying them back to Hong Kong to temporarily stay in hotels. Among the passengers were 48 teachers and staff of overseas Chinese schools and an 11-member delegation of the Guangdong Grand Survey. The ship is now grounded on a stone soil, with two holes in the bow. The first and second holds and the engine room are full of seawater, but the water pump can still pump water. The crew is still on the ship filling the two holes. It may be able to float out when the tide rises. Some of the cargo was damaged. Passengers made four demands to the ship: 1. Return their luggage. 2. Provide a place to rest. 3. Compensate for luggage losses. 4. Send everyone to Guangzhou. The bureau accepted all of them. A Central News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou on the 21st reported that the China Merchants steamer Haiyuan ran aground and was holed shortly after leaving the port for Guangdong on the evening of the 20th. Half of the ship was submerged. Fortunately, the Taikoo steamer Yunnan passed by and rescued all the passengers, sending them back to Hong Kong. The losses are unknown. The ship carried 54 teachers and staff of overseas Chinese schools and members of a survey delegation, all of whom are safe.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Xiangying on the 21st of the Central News Agency reported that the China Merchants Bureau's Haiyuan steamer ran aground in the Jishui Men area this morning while sailing from Hong Kong to Guangzhou. The ship carried more than 170 passengers and about 100 crew members. Most of them have been rescued by the Taikoo Company's Yunnan steamer. The Haiyuan steamer has many holes in its hull due to running aground, and there is a lot of water coming in. However, it is set high on the rocks and will not sink completely.</p>
<h3>Gansu Hexi County Appeal Group Hosts Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Immediately report the disaster situation; fundraising results are satisfactory</p>
<p>The Gansu Hexi Disaster-Stricken Counties Appeal Group hosted the press at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association at 5:00 PM yesterday. More than 30 reporters from various newspapers attended. During the meeting, the representative of the group, Chu Jianxing, reported on the devastation of the Hexi counties by bandits. He said that in Jingtai on October 25th of the 25th year, bandits crossed the river from Jingyuan Zhonghe Fort and besieged the county seat. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers defended effectively, and the county seat did not fall. There were fierce battles 17 or 18 times, with the battle of Daweipai Lock Army Fort and Yitiaoshan being the most intense. The people suffered the most. By November 21st, the territory was cleared. In Yongdeng on November 11th, bandits passed through Hongfan in Tianzhu Township and then fled to the Dayugou Qianchaiwa area of ​​Dongsan Township. After the officers and soldiers pursued and suppressed them, the bandits fled to the Gulang border. In Gulang on November 11th, bandits attacked from Hongliang Mountain and captured the county seat, dividing and disturbing Dajing Tudou and Sishui Fort. The bandits fought against the officers and soldiers, and the county seat was lost and regained three times. With the help of aircraft bombing, the bandits began to retreat on November 25th. The county seat was almost scorched earth. In Wuwei on November 14th, the bandit leader of Dajing Tudou attacked the territory. Later, the defeated bandits from Gulang also arrived, gathering in Dahi Station and other places, attacking the county seat twice without breaking it. The bandits split into two groups, spreading to various places, generally encircling the south of the city to Xixiang 40 Libao Mowan Xiba Jie and other places, and one group from Shuangzhai Shuangchengbao and Sancha Fort, which belongs to Minqin. On the 28th, they were driven away to Yongchang by officers and soldiers. In early December, the bandits counterattacked Wuwei Xixiang Mowan, searching for food and grinding flour. On December 14th, the officers and soldiers drove the bandits out of the territory. After more than ten fierce battles, the countryside was almost completely disturbed, especially Xixiang was the most severely affected. In Yongchang, the bandits attacked and captured the county seat on November 18th. Before long, the defeated bandits from Wuwei also gathered here, entrenched for more than four days. All six districts of the county were ravaged. On December 31st, the county seat was recovered, and the bandits began to retreat and flee. In Shandan in early November, the bandits sent an army to break through the county seat on the 10th day. After more than a month, the bandits entrenched in Yongchang gradually moved west, dividing and disturbing the first, second, and third districts, and fought with officers and soldiers more than 20 times before recovering the county seat. In Minle in early January, the bandits from Shuichang and Shandan invaded the west in separate ways, one group from the eight Dongtan passed through 1, 2, and 3 Yue, and fled into Zhangye, and one group from the north drove to Zhangye. On the 2nd and 3rd, the bandits counterattacked the 4th and 5th districts of Minle from the Ganju Fort Liyuankou. Although the county seat was not lost, all the four townships were occupied and looted. In Zhangye, the bandits fled into the territory from Shandan in early December. After a few days, they returned to Shandan. By the end of December, the bandits came to attack again, and the bandits from Minle also arrived, dividing and disturbing Guchengzi, Jujibao, Damanbao, Longshoubao, and other places, resisting officers and soldiers for more than ten days and fighting more than ten times. Finally, after the bandits were defeated from Linze Gaotai, they all gathered in the Mijia Camp area. After being severely attacked by officers and soldiers, the bandits fled to Liyuankou. The territory of Zhangye was cleared. In Linze on January 1st, the bandits fled into the territory, broke through the county seat, and divided and occupied the second, third, and fourth districts of Heihe Bank, Panshiyizi, and other places. On January 21st, the officers and soldiers recovered the county seat, and the bandits fled to Gaotai. It is found that wherever the bandits passed, they brutally killed people, plundered the people's wealth and food, burned houses and temples, and looted livestock and equipment. All kinds of cruelty are difficult to describe in detail. Therefore, the people in the counties are now displaced, and the starving are everywhere. It is hoped that the Shanghai news media will appeal on their behalf so that disaster relief can be provided to the people as soon as possible. The group has arrived in Shanghai to beg for relief, and the results are satisfactory. It has been decided to leave Shanghai for Gansu within days.</p>

Please be informed accordingly. If your so-called shareholder sub-ledger only records the names of shareholders, according to the Ministry's instruction, it is not necessary to affix stamps. (2) The bonus wage payment record book is one of the account books used in the factory's business and should have stamps affixed. (3) Article 3, Paragraph 5 of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates that account books used by individuals or families do not need to have stamps affixed. Therefore, if your so-called private income and expenditure book only records individual expenses and does not involve the factory's business, it is not required to affix stamps according to law, etc.</p>

<h3>Ren Wangnan, Manager of Juxingcheng Bank, Talks About Sichuan Relief</h3>
<p>The drought in Sichuan Province is severe, and the people of Sichuan are running around appealing to all parties. The current government authorities and people from all walks of life are planning to allocate relief funds to save the disaster-stricken people.

I then consulted with Zhu Ziqiao, chairman of the Relief Committee, on relief methods. At that time, Chairman Zhu and Cao Zhongzhi, a special commissioner of the central treasury, agreed to first allocate 1 million yuan in public bonds, convert them into cash, and then distribute them to the Sichuan Relief Association for relief. Chairman Zhu, Commissioner Cao, and I went to Sichuan, but at that time, the Sichuan Provincial Government had not yet made a concrete report on the disaster situation in various counties. Therefore, Chairman Zhu, Commissioner Cao, and others went to various places in Sichuan to survey the disaster situation and allocate relief funds separately.</p>
<p>Allocating and Remitting Relief Funds</p>
<p>As for the 1 million yuan in public bonds allocated by the central government, after being allocated by the central government, we tried to convert them into cash. When the transaction was settled last month, we received 714,000 yuan or so in cash, which Chairman Zhu sent to the bank. However, due to the cumbersome procedures, it could not be remitted immediately. According to a letter from Xie Jiashi, a committee member of the Relief Association, the funds were remitted to Sichuan from Nanjing on the 17th of this month. According to my estimation, the funds will probably be remitted to Chongqing first, and then transferred to Chengdu. Therefore, Chengdu does not yet know that the funds have been remitted to Sichuan.</p>
<p>Sichuan Issues Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government, because the 700,000 yuan or so in relief funds allocated by the central government was not enough for distribution, plans to raise another 12 million yuan in disaster relief public bonds, of which 2 million yuan is intended to be mortgaged for 1 million yuan to the financial community in Sichuan. However, at that time, due to rumors in Sichuan, the progress of this matter was also difficult. However, Liu Hangchen, director of the Sichuan Finance Department, said that the Sichuan financial community had already made an advance loan, but this matter still needs to be reviewed by the central government.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Leather Factory Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Firecrackers Set Off at Factory Gate, Caojiadu Police Protect</p>
<p>All the workers of the Shanghai Leather Factory on Bailinan Road in West Shanghai went on strike because their demands for improved treatment from the factory were not met. The day before yesterday, representatives from the party and government agencies went to the factory and convened representatives from both labor and management for negotiations. The factory was willing to appropriately increase wages and provide medical expenses to the five workers who were injured in the conflict with the national detectives. The worker representatives were satisfied and signed the agreement, and the workers, led by party and government representatives, entered the factory to resume work at around 7:00 am yesterday morning. Firecrackers were set off at the factory gate, and the Caojiadu Sub-Bureau also sent police to protect the workers entering the factory.</p>
<h3>Dockworkers Demand Wage Increase</h3>
<p>The dockworkers of the city, due to rising prices and suffering in life, recently appointed representatives Pan Shichang, Zhang Changcai, Xue Youlin, etc., to appeal to the First Special District Citizens' Federation and other parties. It is reported that the representatives will again consult with party and government agencies within a few days, demanding an increase in wages to maintain a living, such as 8 jiao in national currency for Chinese boat head dockworkers per worker, 9 jiao for Japanese boat heads per worker, and 1 yuan for boat heads of other countries per worker.</p>
<h3>Lu Bohong and Others Telegraph the Tragic Situation in the Henan Disaster Area</h3>
<p>Dogs, Cats, Chickens, Pigs, Tree Leaves, Roots Eaten Empty, Disaster Victims Fill Their Stomachs with Stone Powder, Please Provide Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association received a telegram yesterday from Lu Bohong and others, disaster relief commissioners in the Henan drought area (title omitted): According to the report from Commissioner Zhang Duomo, after the commissioners took office, they went to the four townships of Mi County to inspect. The disaster situation reported in the newspapers is only speculation, and the true disaster situation has not yet been announced one-tenth. The disaster situation in Mi County is briefly described as follows: Dogs, cats, chickens, pigs, etc., are no longer seen in the villages, and the leaves and bark of tree roots have been stripped and eaten empty. Wild grass is about to become extinct. Bran is the exclusive food of landlords, and stone powder is the food of common people. Those who commit suicide by hanging themselves due to unbearable hunger are seen frequently. Selling wives and children is openly priced and completely disregarded. Most of the strong have fled, and those at home are mostly the old and weak waiting to die. Therefore, according to the results of the resurvey, each household only has three or four days, one or two mouths, or even one mouth without any food. According to the inspection and distribution regulations, those who cannot live without relief are all eligible, but it is difficult to find those who do not need relief and can live. At this time, if large-scale relief is not universally provided, in two or three months, even if someone comes to provide relief, it is feared that there will be very few people to receive it. Such a situation is unbearable to hear. Therefore, we specially send this sample of food for the disaster victims. The stone powder is the food that the villagers dig and eat at will, and the stone cake with a little wheat flour is the food of the people in the city and countryside. Each cake needs to be sold for 200 wen, but those who eat this cake can live for up to three months. We hope to raise huge sums of money quickly to save these survivors, and are extremely anxious to await orders. Respectfully, Lu Bohong, Director, and Li Shaoduo, Deputy Director, Henan Drought Disaster Relief.</p>

<h3>Candy Shop Messenger Accuses Gong Jingyan et al. of Assault</h3>
<p>Yao Fenglin, a messenger at the Shiyuanxiang Candy Shop in Dunhou Lane, Xiaodongmen, sued Gong Jingyan, supervisor of the Tangjiawan Xinyongyuan Nanhua Store and the Nanhua Industry Association, and Mei Lanqing and Hong Sheng, staff members of the association, in the local court for seriously injuring him with a mob. The main point of the accusation stated that the plaintiff used to work in Gong Jingyan's association, but because Gong extensively recruited disciples and controlled everything, excluding dissidents, he voluntarily resigned in the previous year. Recently, Gong, out of resentment for being exposed, believed that the plaintiff had instigated the exposure. At 3:00 pm on the 17th of this month, the plaintiff was returning to the shop from the North-South Grocery Market in Xiaodongmen. When he walked to the alley entrance, Gong Jingyan, along with his disciples Mei Lanxiang and Hong Sheng, led five or six hooligans with weapons and beat the plaintiff severely, causing serious injuries to his waist, head, face, and waist. One eye was blinded, and the left foot was fractured, endangering his life. After examining the injuries, it was ordered that he be sent to the hospital (Qu Zhifu Hospital) for treatment. Yesterday, Prosecutor Jiang opened the court and ordered the defendants Gong Jingyan, Mei Lanqing, and Hong Sheng to each pay 1,000 yuan in cash for bail pending trial, and those who did not provide bail were detained.</p>
<h3>Reconciliation in Nephew's Lawsuit Against Uncle for Property Division</h3>
<p>Shen Hongding, a wealthy man in his sixties residing on Zhaojiabang Road in the city, has a niece, Shen Yilu (21 years old), who lost her parents at a young age. Shen raised her as an uncle and gave her a considerable education. Now that she has become independent, the niece sued her uncle in the local court for not dividing the ancestral inheritance's common property. The main point of the accusation was that when the girl's father, Hongye, passed away, the girl was only nine years old, and even at twelve years old, she lost her mother. Alone and helpless, she lived with her uncle. At the age of fifteen, she was sent to an orphanage, in order to allow the uncle to swallow the entire 100,000-yuan property. Now that the girl has grown up and returned home, the uncle refused to divide the property. Therefore, the girl requested an analysis of the deceased's share of the property. The defendant argued that there was no property from the ancestors, and the existing property came from his own business. However, the girl lost her parents at a young age and was helpless. He, out of kinship, raised her to adulthood. At the age of fifteen, he sent her to school to study needlework. Unexpectedly, she was ungrateful and repaid kindness with malice, making false accusations. There was indeed a difficult-to-express secret. The official advised both parties to settle out of court. Now, both parties have consulted with relatives. The uncle gave the niece 400 yuan to end the lawsuit. There was no proof of common property, and Shen Yilu agreed. However, Shen Hongding stated that during the first court hearing, all the allegations made by Shen Yilu in court were completely slanderous and had an impact on his reputation because the newspapers had reported the news. The plaintiff must be responsible for correcting the news before he would pay the 400 yuan, which led to the failure of the settlement. Yesterday morning, Judge Pang Shurong opened the court again to inquire about the settlement situation. Shen Yilu stated that a settlement had been reached, but because the newspaper reported the record of the previous court hearing, the defendant requested to correct the news, and therefore there was no result. Questioning Shen Hongding, he stated that the 400 yuan settlement was agreed upon by both parties, but the plaintiff had to correct the report that insulted his reputation. The official then said that the case filed was for the analysis of the inheritance. The newspaper reporters made appropriate records of the statements of both parties, which was their duty. Since there was no fabricated situation, there was no need to request a correction. Shen Hongding said yes, yes. So, the settlement record was made in court, because Shen Hongding gave Shen Yilu 400 yuan to permanently resolve the case.</p>
<h3>Hooligans Cut Sugar Cane Vendor with Knives and Axes After Failed Extortion</h3>
<p>Sun Fenglin Cut Four Times</p>
<p>Yu Kunnian, 34 years old, from Jianchang, used to be a platoon leader in the Jiangxi anti-smuggling camp for six years. He currently lives in a tile bungalow near the Xidu Tianmiao on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. Yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 pm, his wife, Ms. Qian (26 years old, from Jiangxi), because their three-year-old son, Zheng Lin, wanted to eat sugar cane, bought a section of sugar cane from Sun Fenglin, who sold sugar cane in the back shed. While Sun was peeling the cane, several local hooligans passed by and saw that Ms. Qian was slightly attractive, so they struck up a conversation with her. Ms. Qian gave them a disdainful look. The hooligans became angry and insisted that Ms. Qian was Sun Fenglin's lover who was selling sugar cane. One hooligan came out to mediate and ordered Sun to give out cigarettes and one yuan to settle the matter. Sun Fenglin, because he was doing small business to make a profit, ignored them. The hooligans immediately used axes and knives to slash Sun Fenglin. Sun Fenglin's left and right arms and legs were each cut four times. The hooligans saw that they had caused trouble and fled in all directions. Later, someone reported to the guard police station of the Taiyangmiao Police Station. The police arrived and sent the injured person to the hospital, and sent Ms. Qian to the Xinzha Sub-Bureau. The police are now arresting the hooligans to bring them to justice.</p>

<h3>Lü Suzhen Appeals Abandonment Case Against Zhuang Dingxin</h3>
<p>Lü Suzhen Loses First Trial</p>
<p>Zhuang Dingxin, from Ningbo, 36 years old, met Hongying Laoba, a famous prostitute from Leyu Lane, Yunnan Road (originally named Lü Suzhen, from Wuxi, address: No. 22, Xinyuan Mudidunji Lane, Fukang Lane No. 1) two years ago. At the time, Zhuang claimed to be sincere and wished to spend his life with Lü. That year, during the Dragon Boat Festival, Lü left the brothel and lived with Zhuang in a pawned house, becoming pregnant as a result. In late May, she gave birth to a boy, who died soon after birth. Zhuang's attitude changed from then on, neglecting Lü's livelihood and effectively abandoning her. Lü then sued Zhuang for abandonment in the Special First Court and filed a civil suit, requesting monthly alimony of 50 yuan. After hearing the case, the Special First Court ruled that Zhuang was not guilty and dismissed the civil suit. Lü was dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the High Court's Second Branch. The High Court approved the appeal, and the High Court's Judge Yu Huajie, accompanied by a trial judge, opened a criminal court for further review yesterday afternoon, ordering a postponement for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Deadline Approaching for Opium Smokers' Licenses; Strict Punishment for Those Who Fail to Renew</h3>
<p>Expanded Publicity Campaign Starting on the 24th; Increased Fines for Those Found Without a Valid License</p>
<p>The police bureau's fourth term for opium smokers' registration was originally scheduled from April 1st to 30th. However, many smokers have been procrastinating and have not yet renewed their licenses. To give opium smokers a final opportunity to renew their licenses, the bureau has extended the deadline by one month to the end of May. With the deadline fast approaching, the bureau issued an order yesterday to all sub-bureaus and teams to instruct opium smokers within their jurisdictions to renew their licenses promptly before the deadline. Otherwise, those found without a valid license will be not only required to pay the renewal fee but also subject to heavier fines. A reporter from Dagong News learned from the bureau's anti-opium department that a list of opium smokers who hold third-term licenses but have not yet renewed their fourth-term licenses is being compiled. Those who fail to renew their licenses by the end of this month will be summoned and severely punished. To alert opium smokers who have not renewed their licenses, the bureau will launch an expanded publicity week starting on the 24th of this month. The anti-opium committee, together with the anti-opium section of the police bureau, will send personnel to various districts to conduct oral publicity.</p>

However, the crowd was difficult to disperse. The officers contacted their superiors by phone. Fearing trouble, they escorted the Japanese detectives back to their station, inquired about the situation, and ordered them to return to their own station to avoid danger.</p>

<h3>French Concession Police Cross Border, Open Fire, and Injure People</h3>
<p>Hou Yishan and Hou Guisheng Seriously Wounded; French Concession Police Investigating the Facts</p>
<p>At 1:45 AM yesterday morning, an incident occurred in the Houjiazhai area, under the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Municipal Police, in the Chinese territory at the end of Avenue See Sielliger, where French Concession police crossed the border and opened fire, injuring people. The incident involved the three-year-old child, Guishi, of Hou Chongshan, a local resident of Houjiazhai. The child had suddenly fallen ill a few days earlier. Believing in superstition and the presence of demons, the family vowed that once the child recovered, they would burn paper money as an offering. When the child recovered, the family was overjoyed. On the night before, they purchased paper goods and prepared food and drink. At 2:30 AM yesterday morning, the child's father, Hou Chongshan, along with his cousins Hou Yishan, Hou Jianshan, and Hou Guisheng, carried the food and paper money to the side of the road at the entrance of Happiness Village, Lane 681 of Avenue Haig, to burn it as an offering. While they were doing so, two French Concession police officers, numbered 831 and 4242, passed by on patrol. Seeing them, they attempted to arrest them. Hou Chongshan and the others, fearing arrest and punishment, fled west into Chinese territory. The French Concession police officers pursued them and opened fire when they were 40 to 60 meters inside the Chinese border. Hou Chongshan and Hou Jianshan managed to escape, but Hou Yishan was shot in the left heel and Hou Guisheng was shot in the left thigh, falling to the ground with severe bleeding. Seeing the consequences of their actions, the French Concession police officers returned to their station to report the incident. The injured men's families reported the incident to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Municipal Police and took the injured men to the Red Cross Hospital on Avenue Haig for treatment. The hospital refused to admit them due to excessive bleeding, so the family took them to the Zhongshan Hospital on Avenue Ferguson for bandages. Around 5 AM, they were taken home for recuperation. However, the French Concession police sent detectives by car to patrol Avenue Petain. When they saw the injured men passing by, they forcibly dragged them into the car and sent them to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The detectives also arrested Hou Jianshan and Hou Siquan and took them to the police station for investigation. Residents of Houjiazhai are said to have expressed serious concerns about the incident. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau is currently investigating the facts to determine the appropriate course of action. According to the French Concession police, at 2:30 AM yesterday morning, a Chinese policeman and a French policeman were patrolling in the French Concession when they saw four people burning paper money near the entrance of Lane 684 of Avenue Haig. Because recent robberies had occurred in the area, and it was late at night in a desolate location, the officers approached to investigate. When the four people saw the officers, they fled. The officers shouted for them to stop, but they did not comply. Mistaking them for thieves, the officers opened fire, injuring two of them. One was injured in the right foot and the other in the left buttock. They were immediately sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Of the other two, one was arrested and the other escaped. The two injured men are a flower grower and a tailor who is also a member of the Houjiazhai defense team. When asked why they fled, they said they were scared by the officers' shouting. The police are currently investigating the truth of the matter.</p>
<h3>Tragedy of Jocularity Among Fruit Store Apprentices</h3>
<p>Wu Ruiqing Throws a Fruit Knife; Xu Qingtang's Abdomen is Slashed and Intestines Spill Out</p>
<p>Wu Ruiqing, an 18-year-old apprentice from Changzhou at the Ju Yu Fruit Store located at No. 243 North Zhejiang Road, was scaling sugar cane with a fruit knife in the store at 9:25 AM the day before yesterday. At the same time, Xu Qingtang, a 17-year-old apprentice also from Changzhou, was washing sugar cane. Due to the limited space, neither would yield to the other. They bickered playfully and then began to argue. Xu threw a sugar cane at Wu, and Wu immediately retaliated by stabbing Xu with the fruit knife, hitting Xu's left abdomen. Blood immediately flowed everywhere, and Xu's intestines spilled out. Wu was shocked and speechless. After someone reported the incident to the Huizi police station, detective Gao Yuqing and an ambulance rushed to the scene, took the injured Xu Qingtang to Tongren Hospital for treatment, and arrested Wu Ruiqing and the weapon. Yesterday morning, Wu Ruiqing was sent to the First Special Court's criminal division. Police lawyer Li Zhishan charged Wu with injury under Article 278, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, described the case, and stated that Xu Qingtang's injuries were serious. He requested that the hearing be postponed for seven days to determine if there were any changes in the injured man's condition for reassessment. Wu Ruiqing confessed that he had accidentally injured Xu Qingtang while playing around. The judge ordered Wu to be detained and postponed the trial for seven days for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Moonlight Ride Innovation</h3>
<p>The term "Moonlight Ride" in Western languages is "Moonlight Riding." It is an ancient custom from the West, embodying the idea of fitness through games. The Lincoln Road Wanguo Riding School on Zhongshan Road has always been known for promoting equestrian skills among Chinese people. To connect riding enthusiasts, it is launching the first Moonlight Ride event, scheduled for 8:00 PM on Wednesday, the 26th of this month. Participants will gather at the school and ride to the Robergeon Hotel. The scenery along the way is elegant, enhanced by the cool night and moonlight, making it exceptionally moving. The outing will be beneficial for both body and mind. It is said that a grand dance party will be held at the hotel to celebrate. It is best to bring female companions to participate. The fee is three yuan per person, with a limit of fifty people. Registration begins immediately.</p>
<h3>Haiyan Silkworm News</h3>
<p>In Haiyan this year, the silkworms in the countryside are already on the racks for spinning. However, due to the cold weather and excessive rainfall earlier in the month, the silkworms ate wet leaves. During their dormancy, 90% of them became sick and died. The harvest is less than 10%, causing the price of leaves to plummet. The villagers can only get one copper coin per catty when they sell them in the market, causing them great distress. This year, because the provincial government allowed the cocoon factories to open and also accept local cocoons, more than half of the farmers raised local silkworms. The failure is so severe that they will have no capital for planting in the fall. The impact is not insignificant.</p>
<h3>Garrison Headquarters to Execute Wire Thieves This Morning</h3>
<p>Cai Guibao Has Been Sentenced Repeatedly and Remains Unrepentant; Accomplice Chen Amao Sentenced to Ten Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Telephone wires for both local and long-distance calls in Shanghai have often been stolen and damaged by bandits, seriously affecting transportation and military affairs. The Ministry of Transportation reported this to the Military Affairs Commission for approval. All military and political organs were ordered to strictly arrest wire thieves. Those caught stealing wires should be punished according to Article 4, Section 5 of the Temporary Measures for Punishing Bandits: those who steal or damage transportation and communication equipment in bandit suppression or martial law areas, rendering it unusable, will be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than ten years. At the same time, the Ministry of Transportation increased the reward money. Those who provide information leading to the arrest of the thieves will be rewarded with 200 yuan, and those who arrest both the informant and the thieves will be rewarded with 500 yuan, so that it will be easier to solve cases with high rewards and combat theft. In December of last year, the Sixth Section of the Road Police arrested Cai Guibao, Chen Amao, and Wu Yuexuan, who were suspected of receiving stolen goods. They were sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters military court for interrogation. The defendant, Cai Guibao, had stolen electric wires near Zhongshan Road in Shanghai in late September 1932. He was arrested by the security team and sentenced to one year in prison by the Shanghai Local Court. He was released in May 1934. In July 1934, he cut telephone wires near Nanxiang on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. He was arrested by the road police and sentenced to one year in prison by the Shanghai Local Court. He was released on December 14, 1935, after serving his term. On the night of April 23, 1936, he cut long-distance telephone wires near the Zhenru Railway Station and was again arrested by the road police and sentenced to six months in prison. He was released on October 20 of the same year. He still did not engage in honest work. On the late night of December 11 last year, he and Chen Amao cut the long-distance telephone lines near Nanxiang, nine kilometers from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, and sold them to Wu Yuexuan, the owner of the Wanyuan Copper and Tin Shop at No. 8211 Fangbang Road. Not only were the suspects caught with the stolen goods, but they also confessed repeatedly. Cai Guibao was sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life, while Chen Amao was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for ten years. All were approved by the Military Affairs Commission and were scheduled to be executed by firing squad this morning at 8:00 AM by the adjutant and a platoon of military police appointed by the headquarters near Longhua Zhongshan Road as a warning. The part of Wu Yuexuan's case involving receiving stolen goods is within the scope of ordinary criminal matters. He was ordered to be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial in accordance with normal judicial procedures. The notice of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters is recorded as follows: "According to the report from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Police on the case of Cai Guibao and others stealing electric wires, please investigate and deal with the matter. The court found that the defendant Cai Guibao made stealing electric wires near Shanghai his profession. He was repeatedly sentenced by the Shanghai Local Court. After being released from prison in October 1936, on the night of December 12 of the same year, he and Chen Amao cut and sold the long-distance telephone lines near Nanxiang. Since the suspect was caught with the stolen goods and confessed in court, he committed the crime of stealing transportation and communication equipment in the bandit area, rendering it unusable. He was sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life in accordance with the law. The case was submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for approval under the order of Fa Chou Zi No. 6538. In addition to verifying the identity of Cai Guibao, he will be tied to the execution ground and executed by firing squad to serve as a warning. This notice is hereby given to the public. Cai Guibao, a 37-year-old from Wuxi, Jiangsu, a thief who stole electric wires, was executed by firing squad. May 22, 1937, Commander Yang Hu."</p>
<h3>Infatuated Luxury Turned to Nothing; Jian Yingfu Accused</h3>
<p>Wu Xiuqing Sues Jian for Seduction and Abandonment; Recounts Their Relationship and Cohabitation</p>
<p>Jian Yingfu, younger brother of Jian Zhaonan, manager of the Nanyang Tobacco Company and also a shareholder, met Wu Xiuqing, a woman from his hometown, at a social event in the Public House Club eight years ago. At that time, both were young and had a common interest in Peking Opera, so they fell in love and began living together. Initially, Jian Yingfu gave Wu Xiuqing 500 yuan per month, and later, when they lived in Tianjin, he increased it to 1,000 yuan. Their love was good, and their life was luxurious and comfortable, like that of gods. However, the beautiful scenery did not last long, and their love broke down, turning from a passionate relationship into a bitter separation. Therefore, Wu Xiuqing recently filed a lawsuit in the criminal division of the Shanghai Local Court, accusing Jian Yingfu of seduction and abandonment. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Xuedeng opened the third criminal court. The defendant, Jian Yingfu, did not appear. The plaintiff, Wu Xiuqing, testified that she was 28 years old, born on the sixth day of the sixth month, originally from Nanhai, Guangdong, and currently residing at No. 14 Jiedeli, Fuxing Road. The defendant, Jian Yingfu, is the fifth brother of Jian Zhaonan, the manager of the Nanyang Tobacco Company, and also a shareholder of the company. When I was under 20 years old, I lived with my mother at No. 247 Changan Lane, Wusong Road. Later, I met the defendant at a banquet and was deceived and seduced by him. He also asked me to eat at the Dongya Restaurant on Nanjing Road and asked me to look at a house with him. In April 1929, we officially began living together in Yong'an Lane, North Sichuan Road. At that time, I lied to my mother and said that I was staying at a relative's house, so my mother did not know. In July 1931, we went to Tianjin together, and my mother found out. Now he has abandoned me halfway and does not give me living expenses, so I am asking the court to investigate and deal with him according to the law, and I am also seeking 30,000 yuan in living expenses in a civil suit. The court ordered that the defendant be summoned, but it is said that he is not in Shanghai but in Hong Kong. Answer: On April 27th, I saw the defendant attending a shareholders' meeting at the Nanyang Tobacco Company on the East Seward Road. The court discussed the need to find out the defendant's exact address before further questioning.</p>

<h3>Publication of Medical Advertisements Must First Be Submitted for Inspection</h3>
<p>Notice from the Municipal Health Bureau</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Health Bureau has been cracking down on substandard medicines and unregistered pharmacies, doctors, and hospitals in order to protect the health of citizens and protect legitimate medical businesses. It stipulates that all Chinese and Western medicine advertisements published in newspapers must be submitted to the News Inspection Office for review between 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM on Wednesdays and Saturdays before they can be published. Since the implementation, most Chinese and foreign pharmacies, doctors, hospitals, etc. have followed the regulations and submitted their advertisements for review. However, a few people who do not understand the actual situation think the procedure is troublesome and have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The Shanghai New Medicine and Pharmaceutical Industry Association believes that it is better to crack down on medical advertisements after they are published than to inspect them in advance. A few days ago, it sent representatives to visit the local health authorities to request their adoption. The bureau believes that the representatives' suggestions are not appropriate. Once substandard medical advertisements are published, their negative impact spreads throughout society, and those who lack medical knowledge are deeply harmed. Post-publication crackdowns are no different from inaction. Most of these advertisements are only published for one day, and post-publication reports are like yesterday's news, which cannot attract the attention of the parties involved. When time passes, they will repeat the old tricks. Moreover, Chinese and foreign merchants have already followed government laws and submitted their advertisements for review. Chinese people should respect and protect the Chinese government more than Westerners, and it is an obligation. In this situation, it is not appropriate to make changes. In addition to sending personnel to explain the above to the pharmaceutical companies, it is difficult to approve their request. It is also replying to the submission. Currently, the bureau fears that a few pharmaceutical companies do not understand the situation and will issue another order for them to comply. It will also provide leniency and convenience within the possible scope. It is also understood that the bureau is considering revising the temporary rules for managing Chinese and Western pharmaceutical companies' news advertisements to make them more appropriate.</p>
<h3>Anhui Southern Anhui Land Registration Requests Grace Period by Telegram</h3>
<p>Huinning Fellow Townsmen Association Telegram</p>
<p>The Huinning Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai recently requested an extension for the land registration in Southern Anhui. The deadline is approaching, and fellow townsmen living abroad are finding it extremely difficult to register in a short time. In addition, there are still areas in Southern Anhui that have been affected by bandits and have not yet recovered, which is making it more difficult to register. The association telegraphed the provincial government and the special commissioners of the ninth and tenth districts yesterday to request an extension of time for the convenience of the people. To Chairman Liu of the Anhui Provincial Government, Special Commissioner Mao of the Xuancheng Ninth District, and Special Commissioner You of the Xiuning Tenth District: Recently, the government has been carrying out land registration. The counties in Southern Anhui have already begun to implement it. However, this association has received letters from most fellow townsmen stating that the counties of Huizhou and Ningguo have repeatedly issued orders urging them to meet the deadline, which is approaching quickly. Those who fail to meet the deadline will be fined. This concerns the property rights of citizens, and they should comply with the order. However, most of the men in the counties of Huizhou and Ningguo are engaged in business outside the province all year round. Most of the people at home are women. In the past, transportation was difficult, and it took three to five years to return to their hometowns. Therefore, they are often unfamiliar with the situation in their hometowns and do not understand it well. In recent years, highways have opened, making it easier to return home. However, as guests, their actions are not up to them. This time, for land registration, the people are required to mark their property and register it within a very short period of time. Otherwise, they will be deemed to have abandoned their property rights and it will be confiscated by the government. However, the people own their property rights, and they are not willing to give them up voluntarily. They are only engaged in business outside the province and cannot return home. There are only elderly, weak, or female people at home. The procedures for registration and marking are complicated, and they are finding it extremely difficult. In addition, there are still areas that have not been pacified by bandits, and the people are displaced. It is even more difficult to carry out registration. We humbly request that you grant an extension of time, extend the deadline, or first carry out registration in safe areas and then gradually promote it to the rest of the region. We also ask that you publish the contents of the land registration in the newspapers at any time and disseminate it to the people as much as possible so that they can understand it. This way, even merchants and tourists can take leave and return home to register according to the law, eliminating difficulties and providing multiple conveniences. We are at your service. Sincerely, Huinning Fellow Townsmen Association. On the same day, the association also telegraphed the Anhui Land Administration Bureau, requesting a copy of the land registration regulations for reference. The association also believes that the land taxes in Southern Anhui are dozens of times heavier than those in Northern Anhui, which has long been unbalanced. It telegraphed Chairman Liu of the Provincial Government, Factory Director Wei Min, and Director Yang of the Finance Department, requesting that they revise the fair tax law, so that the people of Southern Anhui can be relieved of their difficulties and not repeat the mistakes of the era when counties were autonomous, and to equalize land rights and benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Initiates a Celebration for Yuan Ying's Sixtieth Birthday</h3>
<p>Longevity Funds to Build a Chinese Buddhist Association Headquarters</p>
<p>This year, on June 20th, the President of the Chinese Buddhist Association, Dharma Master Yuan Ying, will celebrate his sixtieth birthday. Prominent figures from China and abroad, as well as Buddhists such as Yu Youren, Dai Jitao, the Panchen Erdeni, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaofan, and Hong San, have initiated a celebration for Dharma Master Yuan Ying's birthday. Furthermore, the funds collected for the celebration will be used to construct the headquarters of the Chinese Buddhist Association. The following is the announcement for the establishment of the Chinese Buddhist Association headquarters in commemoration of Dharma Master Yuan Ying's sixtieth birthday, dated June 20th, the twenty-sixth year of the Republic (corresponding to the twelfth day of the fifth month in the lunar calendar): We are pleased to announce the upcoming sixtieth birthday of Dharma Master Yuan Ying, the President of the Chinese Buddhist Association. The Dharma Master benefits sentient beings, bestows fearlessness, practices profound Prajna, resides in the Shurangama Samadhi, embraces the six directions in a single thought, and transcends ten kalpas in a snap of fingers. His worldly lifespan is certainly not something to celebrate, nor would the Dharma Master permit celebrating his longevity in accordance with worldly customs. However, the Dharma Master has been deeply concerned with the world's affairs for many years, stepping forward to defend the teachings, acting as a bulwark in the midst of the current, and stemming the tide of the final kalpa. For the sake of the Dharma and for the people, he labors and endures hardship without complaint. We believe that we must all celebrate the Dharma Master's birthday. It is generally agreed that the Dharma Master's efforts have been instrumental in the continuation of the Chinese Buddhist Association to this day. However, the lack of a permanent headquarters is a significant deficiency. We propose that, on the occasion of the Dharma Master's sixtieth birthday, we will, on the one hand, request the Dharma Master to begin on the first day of the fifth month in the lunar calendar to expound the Benevolent Kings Prajna Paramita Sutra for a month at the Chinese Buddhist Association in Jueyuan, Shanghai, in order to promote national peace and the well-being of all beings. On the other hand, all donations from lay protectors and the fourfold assembly of disciples intended for the Dharma Master will be converted into cash to fund the construction of the Chinese Buddhist Association headquarters, to serve as a permanent memorial. Celebrating the Dharma Master's birthday is, in effect, celebrating Buddhism, conforming to worldly customs without violating the pure intention. We believe that this will be supported and realized by virtuous individuals both inside and outside the country. This is the announcement.</p>
<h3>The Citizens' Branch Association Requests the Public Works Bureau to Complete North Suzhou Road</h3>
<p>The Suzhou Road branch of the Municipal First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to Mr. Fankeling, the director of the Public Works Bureau, yesterday morning. The letter reads: Dear Sir, We have received reports from shops along North Suzhou Road, members of our association, stating that the road reconstruction has not yet been completed. Our association previously sent letters to your bureau regarding this matter on November 15th, December 10th, and December 21st of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, urging you to instruct the Public Works Department to complete the construction as soon as possible to ensure the safety of travelers. Subsequently, on December 2nd, December 24th of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, and January 1st of this year, we received replies from your bureau agreeing to our request. Our association was deeply gratified. However, half a year has passed, and the construction remains incomplete. This indicates that either the Public Works Department is neglecting its duties and prolonging the work, or there is another purpose. Furthermore, it has been reported that the original road surface of the section of North Fujian Road west to North Shanxi Road was already in poor condition. Last year, the stones on this section were removed, making the road an unimaginable mud pit. On sunny days, dust flies, and on rainy days, the mud makes it difficult for pedestrians. The Public Works Department has delayed the construction for half a year. We are at a loss as to the reason. For the convenience of merchants and pedestrians along the road, our association respectfully requests your bureau to instruct the Public Works Department to complete the construction within a specified time frame. We hope that you will give this matter your attention.</p>
<h3>Mother and Daughter Poisoned by Pufferfish</h3>
<p>A local woman, Tang Qiao, residing at No. 54, Yong'an Street, Dongjia Dock, in the Southern City, received a bowl of pufferfish from a relative surnamed Wei (residing on Lao Xianji Road) at approximately 11:30 yesterday morning. She and her daughter, Long Fen, consumed the fish during lunch. Shortly afterward, both mother and daughter experienced severe abdominal pain, numbness in their limbs, and vomiting. However, because Long Fen consumed less, her poisoning was mild. Mrs. Tang, who consumed more, was in a more serious condition. They were subsequently taken to the hospital for treatment by family members.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Directly Manages City Center Rickshaws</h3>
<p>The First Phase Will Involve Ninety Units</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to facilitate transportation in the city center, previously intended to invite merchants to operate rickshaws in the city center. However, merchants, considering that there are not many residents in the city center and fearing that there would be no immediate profits, remained hesitant and unwilling to undertake the operation. As a result, this plan has not been realized soon. According to news from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, adding rickshaws to the city center is a practical necessity, and the operation should not be delayed. Therefore, with the approval of the Municipal Government, it has been decided that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau will operate the rickshaws directly. It has also been decided that the first phase will involve fifty units. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is currently manufacturing them, and they will soon be put into operation.</p>

<h3>Wu Longhe Inheritance Case Requires Payment of Litigation Fees</h3>
<p>The Court Has Ruled</p>
<p>Wu Jianghe, the adopted son of Li Bohang, the third daughter of the late Qing dynasty's envoy to England, Li Bohang, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Li Guotao and others, the children of Li Bohang, and those with inheritance rights to Li Bohang's estate, after the death of Mr. Bohang. He requested a judgment ordering the distribution of Li Bohang's estate according to the law, claiming the right to inherit on behalf of Yang Yin (the son of Li Bohang's eldest daughter). Because he was unable to pay the litigation fees, he applied for litigation assistance. The defendants, Li Guotao and others, argued that Wu had land in Nanjing, Anhui, and was able to pay the litigation fees. They requested that the litigation assistance be rejected and that he be ordered to pay the litigation fees. The court reviewed the evidence presented by both parties. It is now learned that the court has reviewed the evidence presented by both parties and determined that Wu Jianghe is able to pay the litigation fees. Therefore, Judge Luo Can, who is hearing the case, ruled yesterday to reject Wu's application for litigation assistance and ordered him to pay the litigation fees to the court within one week before proceeding with the trial.</p>
<h3>Using the Kodak Company's Name to Sell Fake Quick-Shooting Cameras for Profit</h3>
<p>The Cameras Were Made of Lead and Completely Unusable; The Kodak Company Discovered the Fraud and Reported It to the Police</p>
<p>Dai Dintao, a Shanghai native who owns the Huanqiu Bookstore at No. 7, Lane 140, Shandong Road, recently published advertisements in newspapers in other ports, using the name of the Kodak Company to sell a type of "Haole" quick-shooting camera. The advertisement stated that the cameras were made in the United States and originally cost sixteen yuan, but were now being sold at a reduced price of five yuan in national currency. Those wishing to purchase the cameras could send a letter along with postage to No. 373 Jiujiang Road, Shanghai, and the cameras would be sent to them. Many people in other ports, unaware of the true situation, believed that the cameras were products of the American Kodak Company and ordered them. Some letters were even sent directly to the Kodak Company. After receiving the letters, the company, realizing that it did not sell such cameras, sent Xu Dazhang to investigate. Xu went to No. 373 Jiujiang Road on the 29th of last month to purchase the cameras. However, there was only an apprentice at the address who said that the address was only used to receive letters and did not sell cameras. To purchase the cameras, one had to go through the Huanqiu Bookstore. Xu then went to the bookstore and purchased two cameras for ten yuan. Upon unpacking them, he found that the cameras were crude and flimsy, made only of lead, completely unusable, and made in Japan, not the United States. He attempted to return them, but the bookstore refused. Xu then reported the matter to the Chief Inspector's Office of the General Police Station and requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant. Detectives were sent to search the bookstore and found eleven of the fake cameras. Zhang Shizhu, the police station's lawyer, filed a public prosecution against Dai Dintao on the charge of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday morning, Judge Pan Zhenyang opened a hearing in the Second Court and ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Coal and Charcoal Industry and Transportation Industry Involved in Litigation</h3>
<p>Both Parties Filed Counter-Suits and Maintained Their Own Arguments; The Judge Attempted to Mediate a Settlement Yesterday</p>
<p>Wu Guanhua, the chairman of the Coal and Charcoal Industry Association and owner of the Sentai Wanji Coal and Charcoal Store at Zhongshan Lane, Cuifeng Lane, in the Southern City, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the prosecutor's office of the local court against Zhu Caibao, the current executive committee member of the Coal and Charcoal Transportation Industry Association, and Xia Mingling and Rong Zhong, fee collectors of the association, for coercion and obstruction of business. The complaint stated that, due to violations, fellow merchants had repeatedly reported that since the ninth of this month, in the Nanmatou area, where coal and charcoal boats dock, every morning during the time for buying goods, a group of more than twenty unscrupulous individuals, gathered in groups of three or five, forcibly prevented various coal stores from sending staff to the boats to buy goods, declaring that a dock fee must be paid before business was allowed. They also verbally abused the staff, who, seeing the fierce demeanor of the individuals, had to retreat. The complaint requested the association to take measures to stop the disturbance. After investigation, the allegations were found to be true, and the police were dispatched to the scene, detaining Zhu Caibao and others who were causing the disturbance to prevent further trouble. The complaint requested prosecution. Prosecutor Kong is currently investigating the matter. Zhu Caibao and Xia Mingling, not to be outdone, also filed a self-indictment in the criminal court of the same court against Wu Guanhua, Yu Weiquan, and Zhu Yuanxiang (employees of the Coal and Charcoal Industry Association) for false accusation and insult. The self-indictment stated that at 6:30 AM on May 10th of this year, while the plaintiffs were handling association affairs at the Shanghai Municipal Coal and Charcoal Transportation Wharf, Wu Guanhua and Yu Hengquan suddenly arrived at the wharf with several police officers from the Dongjiadu Police Station and arrested the plaintiffs. Zhu Yuanxiang later brought water patrol officers and arrested Xia Mingling. They were falsely accused of being gangsters extorting money. After interrogation, there were no facts to support the accusations, and the association provided proof. They were released on bail after being taken to the General Bureau. They alleged that these individuals deliberately insulted and falsely accused them and requested that they be prosecuted. Judge Chen opened a hearing yesterday, and both parties provided testimony and maintained their own arguments. The court ordered the files to be reviewed and considered, and urged them to reach an out-of-court settlement.</p>

<h3>Dai Xingkang Invents Automatic Electrical Management Clock</h3>
<p>In addition to Telling Time, It Can Manage Switches; Its Contribution to Industry is Significant; The Ministry Notifies Approval for a Five-Year Special Publication</p>
<p>Dai Xingkang, a Ningbo native residing in Pingle Jia, Yu Qiaqing Road, in this city, recognizing that various electrical tools are useful in the modern era, but their management requires personnel and cannot be automated, has carefully researched and invented an automatic electrical management clock. In addition to accurately telling time, it can automatically manage the switches of various electrical appliances. Whether it is electric lights, electric stoves, electric fans, radios, advertising neon lights, or any other electrical motors, they can be activated simply by connecting the clock's back wiring.</p>
<p>Electrical Management</p>
<p>The automatic electrical management clock invented by Dai Xingkang resembles a small wireless machine. The upper part is the timing section, which can accurately tell time. The lower part is the mechanical section, with a sophisticated structure that can use the clock to manage the switches of various electrical appliances.</p>
<p>Management Method</p>
<p>The automatic management method is as follows: For example, if you want the electric lights to turn on or off at a certain time, simply set the switch in advance, and they will turn on or off at the set time. The management of other electrical appliances is similar. The structure of the machine can be described as ingenious. It can replace the manual management of various motors and make a significant contribution to the industry.</p>
<p>Application for Patent</p>
<p>After inventing the clock, Dai Xingkang submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce last winter for a patent. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued the request to the Industrial Technology Encouragement Committee for testing, which passed. The Ministry issued a notification on December 31st of last year stating that if no interested parties raise objections within six months after the announcement, a five-year patent will be granted. Dai Xingkang, with the six-month deadline approaching at the end of next month, when the patent will take effect, has established a preparatory office in Pingle Lane to prepare for setting up a factory for manufacturing.</p>
<p>Ministry Notification</p>
<p>The notification from the Ministry of Industry is as follows: Ministry of Industry Notification No. 18411, regarding the application for a patent for the invention of an automatic electrical switch. The application was issued to the Industrial Technology Encouragement Committee for review, which has been approved. The report from the committee states that the automatic combination parts of the automatic electrical switch clock, the long nail axis four-way wheel, and the two gear wheels on top of the clock spring should be granted a five-year patent. After six months of public announcement, if no related parties raise objections, the patent will be approved after paying the fees. This is a special notification to Wu Dingyuan, Director of Pingchang.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Secondhand Store Offers a Large Batch of Watches at Low Prices</h3>
<p>One Thousand Pieces for Sale for Two Days Only</p>
<p>The Shanghai Secondhand Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road is known for its high-quality goods sold at low prices, sincerity, and affordability, which have won the trust of customers.

<h3>Maochang "Sun" Sunglasses Receive Trademark License from the Trademark Bureau</h3>
<p>Maochang Optical Company, located at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, recognizing that the summer sunlight is harsh and can damage eyesight, has been selling specially made sunglasses every summer.

<h3>Better to be a Dog in Times of Peace</h3>
<p>— Why Bother?</p>
<p>Lately, almost every day's newspapers carry news of death. The floating corpses in Tianjin continue to surface, while the provinces of Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Gansu are experiencing severe disasters, with millions of refugees crying out for food. Other cases, such as the dismembered female corpse found in this city and the suicide of Cantonese woman Wu Luli by poisoning, are even less noteworthy. There is a saying, "Better to be a dog in times of peace than a person in times of chaos." The so-called "times of chaos" do not necessarily refer only to times of war in the narrow sense.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the floating corpses in Tianjin, according to today's Tianjin communication in the Japanese newspaper, the truth has already come to light." One part of it is drug addicts with no money to satisfy their addiction, who, when the addiction takes hold and they cannot move, are thrown into the river by people hired by opium dens. Another part is laborers who mistakenly believe in rumors and are lured to work outside the Customs. Before they can even set off, if they become slightly ill or discover that they have been deceived and do not want to go, they are also mostly abandoned in the river to drown. This "floating corpse case," which has attracted attention from all sides, seems to have come to an end. It is also no wonder that the Tianjin News Inspection Office initially ordered all newspapers to refer to the victims as "drug beggars," and now simply forbids any mention of it. These many innocent ghosts, whose bodies were dragged into the river with bamboo poles inserted into their anuses or armpits, have truly met the ancient saying, "to die without a burial place."</p>
<p>The disasters in various provinces this year are unprecedented. The daily death toll in each county ranges from thirty to two hundred people. Even those who manage to temporarily stave off hunger by digging up white clay and grass roots are suffering from symptoms such as inability to excrete and swollen feet, and their lives are in danger. Fortunately, after "discussing concrete relief measures," the Ministry of Finance has allocated 1 million yuan in public bonds for disaster relief in Sichuan, which was handed over to the Relief Committee for distribution on April 6. Furthermore, because disaster relief brooks no delay, the Ministry has telegraphed the three banks to advance 300,000 yuan to handle emergency relief. However, according to a telegram from Nanjing on the 20th, "The Ministry of Finance recently received a telegram from Sichuan gentry Shao Mingsheng and Yin Zhongxi, saying that the relief funds have not yet been received, which is very surprising." — It is truly "surprising." The relief funds that were "handed over to the Relief Committee for distribution on April 6" have "not yet been received" as of May 10. After inspecting the disaster areas, the philanthropists should not have forgotten the tragic scene of "refugees in the fields, gathering in groups of three or five, emaciated and haggard, with tattered clothes, carrying infants and young children on their backs, carrying bamboo baskets in their hands, stooping on the ground, digging up grass roots to fill their stomachs," right? Disaster relief is like fighting a fire, but now it has turned into a "specially slow train." Millions of refugees may not be able to wait for the relief funds to be distributed and may have already gone to the underworld to become starving ghosts.</p>
<p>As for the dismembered female corpse found in this city and the suicide of Cantonese woman Wu Luli by poisoning, these are examples picked at random. Every day, when you open the social section of the newspaper, you see records of jealousy and adultery, poisoning, jumping from buildings, and drowning, in a wide variety of cases. In summary, the latter are all oppressed by economic hardship and unable to make a living, so they choose to end their lives. Although this is a personal matter, with the market in decline and unemployment rampant, how can we blame the dead for being "cowardly"? As for the former, of course, it is unacceptable. Love is indeed a need in life, but "sacrificing oneself for love" is too much of an underestimation of one's own promising life. Although many people now have even this "freedom" taken away from them.</p>
<p>However, since we are born as "people in times of chaos," — people are still people and not dogs, and fortunately, we are not reduced to being "drug beggars" in Tianjin or refugees in disaster areas, we should value our lives even more!</p>
<h3>Sunset</h3>
<p>— Ge Yi</p>
<p>Wearily emerging from painful memories, I raised my eyes and met the setting sun, losing its strong, scorching light of midday, on the western horizon; it seemed to have a disdainful smile for me, as if an old acquaintance, standing far away, observing my ridiculous movements and sorrowful soliloquies, and making that face.</p>
<p>People mourn youth like the setting sun and feel melancholy about the sentiment of "the setting sun is infinitely good, but it is only near dusk." I have another analogy: the greatness of an old man who has lived a life without guilt, passing away with a smile.</p>
<p>I cannot forget the scene of my old grandfather at sunset. He lay on the hard wooden bed in the thatched cottage he built with his own hands, vaguely watching the concentrated light of the setting sun shining in through the small square window,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>in the flat room where he was lying, and he closed his eyes peacefully and contentedly. His face was kind and peaceful - without regret, without longing. Like a child who is tired and goes to sleep.</p>
<p>Grandfather said to Father:</p>
<p>— I want to rest well; I have never been in debt in my life. I am happy.</p>
<p>Grandfather was an honest farmer, and so was Father. They ate the breath that came from the soil tilled by their own sweat and blood, and they led their children on the foothills of the plains, leisurely forgetting the years, just farming. Every evening at sunset, they would lead the plowing oxen and carry back the dried straw; they would wash their feet by the stream and watch the stars and moon on the rocks. Without any ugliness, they slept in dreams until the rooster crowed the next day.</p>
<p>But the young people of today are not like that! They harbor infinite melancholy towards the setting sun, feel emptiness of life at the end of life, and unbearable guilt surges up from the dreams of the past! The terror of death and the longing for life are intertwined, and in this moment, they only have an anxious and painful heart.</p>
<p>— Life is boring and painful, they say. I deeply remember the sorrowful words of a friend who died young, at the moment he knew he was about to die:</p>
<p>— ××, I don't want to die now! ... God ... I ...</p>
<p>The continued groaning was trembling, like the howling of a wounded and bleeding wild beast!</p>
<p>But this friend, in his youth, wrote many articles praying for death! He cursed life, he himself punctured the visible dream he had, he was constantly taking revenge on life, and finally dug his own grave. But in the world he was about to leave, he so contradictorily wanted to be reborn for a while!</p>
<p>The setting sun follows its path, it has had the rising sun that poets have praised, and the midday sun that has delivered heat to revolutionaries. From morning to dusk, it stores many latent heats in the world, giving people warm memories.</p>
<p>You say: Can you mourn its fate? Do you have the courage to lament the sorrow of humanity before the setting sun? The setting sun has sunk. At night, it still gives light to the moon.</p>
<h3>Youth Leisure Activities in Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>The club association presided over by the Joint Committee of Women's Organizations of this city held its ninth annual meeting at the American Women's Club office on Jing'an Temple Road on the morning of the 19th of this month. About two hundred Chinese and foreign ladies participated. Because the purpose of this meeting was to discuss youth issues, the walls were covered with images of young people from various countries, and the shelves were hung with many booklets describing youth movements in various countries for browsing. The room was filled with the air of youth.</p>
<p>First, Mrs. Cornish, president of the American Women's Club, delivered a speech welcoming the ladies present. Then, Mrs. Whitely, chairman of the Joint Committee, delivered a speech, briefly stating that the Joint Committee is composed of women's clubs from China, Britain, the United States, and other countries. Over the years, it has aroused social attention to issues such as child labor, housing, and the rickshaw problem. The Joint Committee's activities on these three issues have been accepted by the Shanghai Municipal Authorities and are being remedied. The Joint Committee is constantly concerned about important issues in this city and has also established a vocational guidance subcommittee. The topic discussed at this meeting "is the issue of youth and their leisure activities." This issue is very complex, and it may not be possible to address the entirety of it in the short two-day meeting period. However, this association intends to investigate all actions taken overseas regarding this matter, and then investigate the situation in Shanghai, and what methods can be used to improve the current faults. It is hoped that the committee can obtain concrete suggestions to assist young people, which can benefit the public.</p>
<p>Next, Dr. Roman raised the question of whether Shanghai is a "youth city." She said: Because the three municipal bureaus in Shanghai compile household registration books in different ways, the true ages of the people of Shanghai cannot be determined. According to her opinion, the number of foreign women between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five is about seven hundred more than the number of foreign men. There are a total of 23,455 foreign men and women of this age in Shanghai, 12,979 boys and girls under the age of fifteen, and 29,555 men and women between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five. There are 3,615 more men than women in this category. There are 9,303 men and women over the age of forty-five. It can be seen that among the foreign residents in Shanghai, those between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five account for the largest proportion. Shanghai, even if it is not a "middle-aged city," can be considered an "adult city," because men and women under the age of fifteen only account for 20%, those under the age of twenty-five account for 38%, and those over the age of twenty-five account for 62%. As for the Chinese population: Shanghai has fewer children than any other city in China. In Shanghai, those over the age of fifteen account for the largest proportion, and there are more men than women. Ms. Roman presented these dry statistics only to hope that the audience would pay attention to the adult men and women who account for the majority of the population when discussing youth issues.</p>
<p>After Ms. Roman finished speaking, representatives from various countries described the leisure activities of young people in their respective countries, so that the audience could choose the best and follow it in the future. Among them, there were many interesting facts.</p>
<p>First, Mrs. Rogerson spoke about the situation in England: The British public attaches great importance to the issue of youth leisure activities. The late King George V of England was very concerned about the development of youth. Therefore, after his death, the people believed that the best way to commemorate him was to raise donations and establish youth sports grounds throughout the country. After the initiative was launched, donations poured in. Leisure activities in England after school age are purely voluntary, because the British oppose things that have the implication of youth military training. The British government is currently encouraging local authorities to establish sports grounds, swimming pools, tennis courts, etc. At least one "welfare officer" is employed in major factories in England. His responsibility is to manage the physical and mental well-being of the workers. Many factories also set up drama clubs and singing clubs. These activities are particularly effective in entertaining and pleasing the mind during the winter months. Both the male and female "Youth Associations" provide various sports facilities for boys and girls, indoors in winter and outdoors in summer. "Sunday Schools" also provide various ball games and sports grounds for young people, and organize dances and concerts. Around the elementary schools, there are places for children to exercise, and the land needed is provided by the local authorities. In addition, there are organizations such as the "Rotary Club" that help manage sports affairs. The "Hiking Club" in England includes a wide range, including "Bicycle Clubs," "Mountaineering Clubs," and "Field Biologist Societies." "Boy Scouts" and "Girl Guides" are also two major needs that are suitable for young people. In addition, the Conservative Party, the Labor Party, and the Liberal Party all pay attention to youth activities, provide various entertainment centers, and organize speech and debate training classes. Every major city has a youth library for young people to increase their knowledge in addition to physical training. The "Women's Civic Society" and "Cooperatives" also provide assistance to hundreds of other organizations. The "Women's Civic Society" is divided into four departments: business, education, entertainment, and group work. It was first established in 1915, and a survey in May last year showed that there were 5,342 such societies nationwide. An important item in the program of youth leisure activities in England is the "Youth Hostel Federation." It was founded in 1930 by the Mayor of Liverpool, imitating the German method. In just a few years, there were 260 such hostels nationwide, with a total of 60,000 members. Members over the age of twenty-one pay an annual membership fee of five shillings, those between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one pay an annual membership fee of two shillings and sixpence, and those between the ages of fourteen and sixteen pay an annual membership fee of one shilling. All members can stay in these 260 hostels, paying one shilling per night, and in some places, young children only need to pay sixpence per night. The hostel provides clean beds and the convenience of washing and cooking, and members can also purchase meals from the steward at a very low price. Members only need to fulfill very light obligations, such as washing dishes and folding quilts under the guidance of the steward. The purpose of the "Youth Hostel Federation" is to give young men and women the opportunity to travel all over Great Britain at extremely low travel expenses. The expenses of the above-mentioned organizations are either allocated by the government or donated by enthusiastic ladies in the country, all with a great purpose—to enable young people to make progress that is beneficial to their physical and mental well-being during working hours and in their spare time.

<h3>Sai Jinhua</h3>
<p>— Chen He made</p>
<p>Twenty-two</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua, entrusted by Waldersee, went to various places with several junior officers every day to procure grain. When merchants saw that Sai Jinhua was handling military supplies, they dared to come forward to accept business. However, along the way, foreign soldiers still grabbed people. Regardless of whether they were Boxers or not, as long as they were slightly suspicious, they would be killed. When Sai Jinhua saw this, she always explained for them: "He is not a Boxer, I guarantee it! I guarantee it!" As a result, countless people were saved.</p>
