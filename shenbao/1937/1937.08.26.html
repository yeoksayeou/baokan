<h3>敵再犯羅店經我軍血戰三面包圍</h3>
<p>蕰藻浜獅子林殘敵失去聯絡　南匯海灘敵兵受重創後潰退　虹口楊樹浦一帶我維持原綫</p>
<p>昨日全部戰局、敵根據其預定作戰計劃、以主力二團、再度進犯羅店鎮、我守軍血戰竟日、以寡敵衆、迨我大軍趕至後、猛烈激戰、三面將敵包圍、敵雖竭力謀突圍而出、但終不可能、截至今晨四時止、尚在圍困中、蕰藻浜·吳淞砲台灣·獅子林一帶登陸之殘敵、經我軍全綫攻擊、截成數段失去聯絡、力量已不足慮、至江灣閘北滬東區戰事、比較沉寂、我軍維持原有陣綫、浦江敵艦、時向浦東我軍陣地作斷續之砲轟、此則無非為虛張聲勢、牽制我兵力計、無關全部戰局也、</p>
<h3>敵再犯羅店被困</h3>
<p>被我三面包圍</p>
<p>（本報特訊）羅店為寶山縣屬首鎮、距小川沙口祗十二里許、交通甚便、故敵軍於此綫、傾全力進攻、第一次侵入羅店之敵、約千餘人、業於二十四日下午被我軍解決、第二次侵入之敵、約有兩團之衆、至今晨記者屬稿時止、據前方報告、已為我軍三面包圍激戰中、可無問題、昨日下午、敵因傷亡過重、已稍後退、旋以大隊飛機、飛來轟炸、彈如雨下、泥士飛濺、煙燄迷天、羅店全鎮幾成焦土、我軍仍死守待援、未嘗稍退、犧牲之壯烈、得未曾有、至下午三時許、我大部援軍開到、當卽增加前綫、奮力攻擊、至薄暮六時、敵已有不支模樣、</p>
<p>敵謀主力進犯</p>
<p>我軍二十三日下午四時殲滅犯我羅店之敵時、奪獲敵所用地圖及武器甚夥、已誌昨報、玆悉此項地圖經由前方司令部派員送滬於昨日下午六時、招待外報記者時當塲展覽、查該圖上對羅店方面一綫、有主力進犯之標記、故二十三日敵雖遭慘敗、預料必將捲土重來、昨日之再度進犯、實為意料中事、現我軍士氣旺盛、防禦森嚴、必能予敵軍以强烈之打擊、粉碎敵之作戰計劃也、</p>
<p>我軍士氣百倍</p>
<p>（本報特訊）羅店方面之敵、昨晚十時起向我全綫攻擊、希圖奪圍而出、槍砲聲密集下、繼以肉搏、我軍士氣百倍、敵亦拚死頑抗、激戰至今晨四時、敵仍在我軍包圍中、</p>
<p>獅子林我搜索殘敵</p>
<p>吳淞砲台灣·獅子林·及小川沙間（卽石洞二帶、登陸之敵、約計一聯隊、經我軍將士、忠勇應戰、血戰二晝夜、在雙方極度猛烈砲火之下、已將敵擊退、昨日竟日、有劇烈之激戰、敵負嵎頑抗、直至昨晚、我軍已將敵軍解决、被我擊斃之敵軍、查其番號、為第十一、第四十三、第四十六各縱隊、尚有若干殘敵、我軍正在搜索之中、</p>
<p>據官方消息、二十三日晨黎明之前、突有敵第十一第四十三及第四十六等三旅之衆、分乘小輪四五十艘、在獅子林及小川沙（卽石洞）、乘黑夜偷渡登岸、我軍當卽奮勇迎擊、激戰至上午六時、敵軍被截為二、一部竄往瀏河、另一部則竄往寶山、我軍立卽分途追擊、直至昨晨（二十五）已將敵軍肅淸、當時我軍在一擊斃之敵軍軍官衣袋中、搜獲軍用地圖一紙、對於偸渡登岸之一帶地勢、繪述甚詳、</p>
<p>蕰藻浜敵在包圍中</p>
<p>蕰藻浜張　華浜偸渡之敵、經我軍前進、予以猛擊、昨已大半解决、剩餘殘敵、為數有限、已在我軍重重包圍之中、殘敵雖屢欲突圍下艦圖逃、困不得出、尚在掙扎之中、向江岸潰退之一部份、經我軍以機槍掃射、洛水溺斃、數不可計、</p>
<p>（中央社）據官方消息、敵軍一千餘人、二十三日晨在蕰藻浜偸渡登陸、我軍當卽予以迎頭痛擊、激戰達一晝夜之久、迨至二十四日上午十時許、我方援軍到達、合併以手溜彈及機關槍向敵猛攻、敵受重創、我軍繼卽在密集彈雨之下、浴血前進、敵軍不支、倉皇登艦而逃、敵軍之落水而溺斃者、達五百餘人、目前蕰藻浜已無敵踪、</p>
<p>南匯海灘敵已潰退</p>
<p>中央社云、前晨（二十四日）黎明之前、突有敵軍約一千二百餘人、偸渡登岸、我軍當卽加以包圍、始則以槍械密集掃射、繼則以白刃浴血肉搏、迄昨晨止、敵全部潰退、</p>
<p>中央社云、前日上午、敵艦多艘、隨帶小艇、開抵南匯海灘、卽以排砲向我岸上轟擊、移時、卽以小艇滿載步兵、駛近灘岸、潮湧上陸、我守軍佯示力薄、僅以小部隊與敵周旋、敵軍乘勢深入、我大部守軍、俟敵立足未穩之際、以機關槍之集中火力、向屬全綫掃射、復以砲火脅敵後路、敵狠狽萬狀、我軍伺機衝鋒肉搏、敵衆披靡、傷亡累累、是役敵軍登陸者約一千人、生還者僅百餘人、我軍□□部損傷不大、</p>
<p>淞口敵艦一沉一傷</p>
<p>中央社、昨晨（二十五日）零時五分一時三十分左右、我空軍父曾數度出動於浦江及吳淞口上空、轟炸敵艦、時月光皎潔、萬里無雲、但聞機聲軋軋軋、不絕於耳、淞口及浦面之敵艦、遂紛以探海燈照射、並亂放高射咆、卒因我駕駛員膽大心細、技術神妙、依然在敵艦業中、活躍異常、當時曾投下數彈、並開放機關槍掃射、據前日抵淞口之加拿大皇后號輪乘客西人多人、於昨日上午抵滬談渠等目睹停泊淞口外之砲艦一艘、被我擊沉、驅逐艦一艘、被我擊中尾部、受傷甚重、</p>
<h3>虹口楊樹浦一帶我軍何機向敵續攻</h3>
<p>據官方公布、二十五日我軍在虹口及楊樹浦一帶之陣綫、並無變動、聞我軍决嚴守所得之優勢陣地、伺機向敵繼續進攻、</p>
<p>確訊、連日戰事重心、已移至吳淞一帶、關於虹口方面我軍情况、外界極為關心、茲經記者向軍事機關負責者探詢、據稱、虹口我軍陣綫、决無變動、因殘敵已在我重重包圍之中、迭次反攻、損失奇鉅、現在敵决無反攻之能力也、</p>
<p>敵增援陸軍三師團</p>
<p>（中央社）敵軍在楊樹浦虹口方面、已陷於勢窮力覽之境、覆滅之期、必不在遠敵在此綫戰事、自始卽居被動地位、受制於我優勢之兵力、無法轉移戰局、現敵欲解上海戰局之危、故增援陸軍三師團來滬、欲圖登陸、牽制戰局、并轉捩其悲慘地位、連日在我長江下游各口及南匯沿海各處、企圖登岸、均被我軍擊退、損傷極大、頃據軍界特訊、我增援部隊到達沿海沿江各要點、實力極為雄厚、敵軍雖欲拚死、打開一條血路、已不能越雷池一步、</p>
<p>敵軍易松井為主帥</p>
<p>中央社、敵軍以在滬慘敗、由國內調三師團來滬增援、並派松井石根大將為主帥、連日在我沿江一帶、企圖登陸、經我痛擊、敵軍傷亡之重、為作戰以來所未有、聯隊長一名、亦被擊斃、敵軍出師不利、銳氣為之大挫、</p>
<p>浦江敵艦轟擊浦東</p>
<p>浦江中之敵艦、昨晨四時許、開砲向我浦東方面轟擊、我亦卽以巨砲還擊、旋至午刻、我□□方面之砲兵陣地、又以重砲轟擊浦中之敵艦及楊樹浦虹口一帶之敵軍陣地、敵方損失奇重、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）浦江敵艦於昨晚九時五十分、又向我浦東陣地砲轟、我軍亦沉着還擊、砲戰約二十分鐘卽停、至十一時半、敵艦砲聲復作、於是又互相轟擊、砲聲時作時息、至今晨一時半、才告停止、</p>
<p>敵機肆虐掃射難民</p>
<p>（中央社）敵機多架、昨晨（二十五日）又在浦東南市一帶肆意轟炸、並低飛向我難民掃射、</p>
<p>又浦東方面連日敵機轟炸、殘殺無辜平民、洋涇曾被投兩彈、死傷二十餘人、爛泥渡、楊家渡等處、亦常有傷亡、於是屬於洋涇區之居民、（洋涇區轄洋涇其昌棧·爛泥渡·楊家渡等）、於前昨兩日、漏夜逃奔、向南避難、絡繹於途者凡兩晝夜未盡、路上老弱、因病不堪跋涉者、隨處均有死亡、情殊可憫、記者調查洋涇鎮上、不但閔無一人、卽鷄犬牲畜、亦極稀少、眞浩刦也、而塘橋區方面、位於南黃浦一帶、旣無市慶一、農民居多、在十六舖封港以後、本為安堵之後方、奈敵人一貫其搗亂政策、白晝飛機、由浦江飛過、時投炸彈、稍整之房屋、卽為目標、而夜間砲轟、亦每墮於該處、致無辜鄕民、當受其殃、故鄕民咸往南匯一帶逃去、步行最少二十里、可憐之狀、令人酸鼻、又昨日下午及今日上午九時、浦東及南市、被敵機轟炸、死傷者、計有昨日浦東盛家弄錫箔莊被炸彈炸毀、店主及一路人並一犬炸死、今日南市高昌廟附近、被炸死三人、均為苦力貧民、</p>

<p>雙方激戰歷經五十一小時之久　居民房屋被焚燬慘酷不可言狀</p>
<p>兩所房屋兩個華人</p>
<p>（本報特訊）自星期六夜中、敵軍開始集中軍艦密集砲火、並有大隊敵機轟炸以企掩護步兵上陸、經我軍奮力迎擊、雙方激戰、歷經五十一小時之久、吳淞全鎭、幾摧毀殆盡、昨日懸掛意國旗之龍山輸、在上午九時、開進吳淞口、至十二時、始到上海、據該輪船員對記者言、龍山於九時進口、淞口砲火已息止、該輪沿浦江至滬、渠所目覩者、從吳淞到軍工路之發電廠止、祇有兩所房子略為完好、其餘之房屋、幾盡數燬去、該艦員又稱、吳淞起至楊樹浦止、沿江邊一帶、祇見兩個中國人、在江邊撈模形如捉魚、該船員後目覩些一人被敵軍瞥見後、不問情由、卽亂槍將二人打死、其情形之慘酷、眞匪可言述者也、</p>
<p>赤燄騰空火勢猛烈</p>
<p>確悉、吳淞張華浜鐵路工廠碼頭灘上登岸日軍、昨晨八時許、已完全解决、敵艦發砲稀少、據來滬之某機關職員告記者云、吳淞方面自二十四日下午二時起至習日早晨、敵機十餘架、終宵肆虐、投下炸彈百餘枚、居民房屋被燬、難以數計、慘酷不堪言狀、蕰藻路永安紗廠及對浜之大中華紙廠兩大建築、着彈延燒、第見赤焰騰空、火勢猛烈、損失奚止千萬、又据羅店到滬某君謂、前晨北川沙石洞口登陸之敵軍三百餘人、初竄盛橋一帶、十一時許、已到達羅店市、遂分佈各要道、搜查行人、焚燒房屋、午后集中玉皇寺、迨我軍××師聞訊馳至、卽包圍撲滅、敵兵無一𣼣網、故昨日吳淞獅子林北石洞等處沿海岸經我軍全部收復、已無敵軍踪跡、並加派重兵駐守、此後各該地帶、海面雖有敵艦排列、亦難越雷池一步也、</p>
<h3>日華紗廠搜出大宗軍火</h3>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>戰時人民應有的努力</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>當前的戰爭是偉大的民族解放戰爭。我全國軍民抱着抗戰到底的决心。非到日本帝國主義的侵略軍隊退出了我們國境的一天。這戰爭是决不能停止的。</p>
<p>正惟如此。我全國同胞人人應當作長期戰爭的凖備。人人應當在這戰爭中間。各盡其應盡的責任。可是大多數的同胞們因為知識落後的緣故。𦣪到大戰的襲來實在免不了迷惘和慌亂。這是妨礙抗戰的前途的。各地的知識分子。應當趕快集合起來。恊助黨政當局來指導他們。組織他們。使他們成為抗戰中莫大的助力。</p>
<p>我們知過近年來政府舉辦保甲制度和軍事訓練已經收了不少的成效。可是各地辦理保甲的人員對於現代戰爭的性質和這次全國抗戰的意義。大都沒有充分的認識。在這戰爭期間。保甲制度的效能。似乎還顯得不夠。而各地黨部及敎育機關職業團體似乎也還不能和保甲組織保持密切的合作。怎樣使保甲制度在戰時發揮充分的效能。而成為民衆組織的基礎。這是各地的知識分子所應首先努力的。</p>
<p>其次。這次戰爭卽然是我全民族持久的艱苦的鬥爭。我們不可因一隅的勝利而自滿。也不可因一時的挫折而頹喪。必須長久保持不屈不撓的勇氣。方才叮以獲得最後的勝利。因此後方的民衆除直接對前方的部隊給以各方面有力的恊助以外。還須在內地盡力於種種的生產建設。使生活的一切必需品得以自給自足。這原是維持抗戰能力的必要條件。而在跑火毀滅了上海的工業區域。幾百萬工人流離失所的時候。為安揷這班都市失業工人起見。內地的生產建設尤其見得急要。可是生產建設一則需要着相當的資金二則需要着妥善的規劃現在全國金融正在政府有效的統制之下。要使資本家提供資金似乎還不至於沒有辦法。所望的是各地工商界富於知識和經驗的優秀分子。各就當地的情勢。趕速擬訂了戰時生產建設的方案。在政府和資本家的合作之下。積極推行。務使國家的生產能力不因戰事而受到嚴重的影響。</p>
<p>除了促進生產以外。民衆方面還須竭力减縮一切物資的消耗。因為戰時國內的物資在軍事上的消費是很大的。民衆方面减少一分消費。軍事方面就增强一分力量。因此社會上一切奢靡的舊習慣。在戰時必須澈底地革除了才好。在中產階級以上的人們這也是應當努力的。</p>

<p>近三日來、戰事重心、已轉移至沿江沿海一帶、有數處被一部份敵軍達到登岸目的、但我方在吳淞、張華浜·蕰藻浜·獅子林·羅店·南匯·川沙·瀏河等處、兵力雄厚、當敵軍陣地未穩之際、卽以全力攻擊、我大隊援軍均已到達、現取大包圍形勢中、誓必肅淸、現除羅店鎭外、今晨尚在激戰、不久卽可殲滅、其餘各地均已不成問題、至於滬東方面、日來雖無激烈戰事、而前哨綫仍時有小接觸、我軍固守原防、有恃無恐、大約三二日內、全部戰事必有新發展、</p>
<h3>羅店鎮內敵軍解决</h3>
<p>我陸空軍上下並進　短時間內不難殲滅</p>
<p>羅店鎮內敵軍已被我軍全部解决、現我方集中兵力、向盤據鎮外之敵軍、猛烈攻擊、敵軍勢窮力孤、不久卽可被我解决確息、今晨最前方報告、敵軍約兩團之衆、再度侵入羅店以東一帶後、卽被我該處原有守軍猛力抵禦、阻止前進、同時我方卽由□□方面□□部、迅速開動大軍、向前積極推進增援、昨晚已全部到達該地與前綫部隊、密切聯接、逐漸完成三面大包圍形勢、自昨日午後起、至今晨止、雙方激戰甚烈、敵艦數十艘、以密結砲火、向孜大塲方面猛轟、並有飛機多架投彈、希圖阻止我援軍、破壞我陣地、我方亦以重砲還華、向時出動寧軍，卜下皴進．故昨夜砲聲、澈宵未停、又確軍界息、我軍實力雄厚、敵軍驚魂甫定、短時間內不難殱滅、</p>

<h3>川沙今晨雙方激戰</h3>
<p>敵於今晨尚圖偷襲　刻下尚在殲滅之中</p>
<p>川沙方面、同於昨晨有一小部敵軍乘各路激戰時、在該處沙灘附近、企圖登岸、當被我軍立卽擊退、未幾敵援軍趕到、又復進窺、其總數不下五六百名、在敵機及重砲掩護之下、猛向我軍陣地衝鋒、我軍早有凖備、亦立卽反守為攻、雙方肉搏良久、敵終受創而退、嗣後又曾數度進犯、均未得逞、今晨黎朋時、敵軍尚圖偷襲、因曾發生激戰、刻下仍在殲滅中、</p>

<p>我飛機時往夜襲投彈　敵艦紛紛移動避危險</p>
<p>虹口一帶日艦、昨晚與我浦東駐軍、發生劇烈砲戰、蓋敵方以多數兵艦、駛往淞口、此間戒備力單薄、恐浦東我軍乘機渡江、向楊樹浦虹口一帶日軍背後陣地夾擊、故發砲示威、實則各艦莫不異常恐慌、我軍復乘找飛機夜襲之際、加以密集砲火向各艦轟擊、彈落如雨、日艦紛紛前後移動、以避危險、狼狽之狀、莫可言、直至天明、砲聲始止、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>自滬戰發生以來。敵人被困於楊樹浦閘北一帶。非但無法進展。且有日促之勢。倘無援軍。立將殲滅。可預决矣。敵方鑒於情勢之不利。援軍大至。明知原有戰區。無法展佈。不得不於沿江沿。海口岸。尋覓出路。故以後戰局的農開。原為必至之事實。此亦我國軍事當局早為籌及者也。</p>
<p>各國干涉中日一事。迄今意見尚未一致。法最積極。英僅焦慮。美仍觀望。此固因浴國利害關係深淺之不同。或自身地位與國策之不同。態度各異。原屬顯然。而其承認日本為侵略。黷武之國家。則初無二致。然自九一八事伴後。我國依賴他人的心理。早已過去。我們只有以沉着應戰四字報答敵人。更無暇考慮各國之態度若何矣。</p>

<h3>The Enemy Again Invades Luodian, Encircled on Three Sides After Our Army's Bloody Battle</h3>
<p>Remnants of the Enemy at Shizi Lin, Yunzao Bang Lose Contact; Enemy Soldiers on Nanhui Beach Suffer Heavy Losses and Retreat; We Maintain the Original Line in the Hongkou and Yangshupu Areas</p>
<p>According to the entire battle situation yesterday, the enemy, based on its predetermined operational plan, again invaded Luodian Town with two regiments as its main force. Our defending soldiers fought fiercely all day, using a small force to resist a larger one. After our main force arrived, they engaged in fierce fighting and encircled the enemy on three sides. Although the enemy tried its best to break through, it was ultimately impossible. As of 4:00 AM this morning, they were still surrounded. The remnant enemies who landed in the Yunzao Bang, Wusong Fort, and Shizi Lin areas were cut into several sections and lost contact after our army's full-scale attack. Their strength is no longer a concern. The battles in the Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Eastern Shanghai districts were relatively quiet. Our army maintained its original line. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River intermittently bombarded our army's positions in Pudong, but this was merely a show of force to contain our troops and was irrelevant to the overall battle situation.</p>
<h3>Enemy Again Invades Luodian, Now Trapped</h3>
<p>Encircled by Us on Three Sides</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Luodian is the main town in Baoshan County, only about twelve li from Xiaochuan Sha Estuary, with convenient transportation. Therefore, the enemy army is focusing all its efforts on attacking this line. The first enemy invasion of Luodian involved about a thousand men, who were dealt with by our army on the afternoon of the 24th. The second enemy invasion involved about two regiments. As of the time this reporter was writing this morning, according to reports from the front, they have been encircled by our army on three sides and are engaged in fierce fighting, so there should be no problem. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy retreated slightly due to heavy casualties, but then a large squadron of aircraft flew in to bomb, with bullets raining down. Mud and earth splashed everywhere, and smoke filled the sky. The entire town of Luodian was almost reduced to scorched earth. Our army still held its ground and awaited reinforcements, never retreating even slightly. The sacrifice was unprecedentedly heroic. Around 3:00 PM, our main reinforcements arrived and immediately moved to the front lines, launching a vigorous attack. By dusk at 6:00 PM, the enemy was already showing signs of collapse.</p>
<p>Enemy Plans Main Force Invasion</p>
<p>When our army annihilated the enemy invading Luodian on the afternoon of the 23rd, we seized many maps and weapons used by the enemy, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that these maps were sent to Shanghai by personnel from the front headquarters and exhibited on the spot yesterday afternoon when foreign reporters were invited. An examination of the map revealed that the Luodian front line was marked for a main force invasion. Therefore, although the enemy suffered a disastrous defeat on the 23rd, it was expected that they would make a comeback. Yesterday's re-invasion was, in fact, expected. Currently, our army's morale is high, and defenses are tight. We will surely give the enemy a strong blow and shatter their operational plans.</p>
<p>Our Army's Morale Is a Hundredfold</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Starting at 10:00 PM last night, the enemy on the Luodian front launched an all-out attack on our lines, hoping to break out of the encirclement. Amidst dense gunfire and cannon fire, they followed with hand-to-hand combat. Our army's morale was a hundredfold, and the enemy also fought stubbornly to the death. The fierce fighting continued until 4:00 AM this morning, and the enemy is still surrounded by our army.</p>
<p>Our Army Searches for Remnant Enemy at Shizi Lin</p>
<p>Between Wusong Fort, Paotai Wan, Shizi Lin, and Xiaochuan Sha (i.e., the areas around Shidong), the enemy that landed, estimated to be about a regiment, was met with loyal and courageous resistance from our army. After two days and nights of bloody fighting, under extremely intense artillery fire from both sides, the enemy was repulsed. Yesterday, there was fierce fighting all day. The enemy resisted stubbornly, but by last night, our army had eliminated the enemy. The enemy soldiers killed by us were identified as belonging to the 11th, 43rd, and 46th columns. There are still some remaining enemy soldiers, and our army is currently searching for them.</p>
<p>According to official sources, before dawn on the morning of the 23rd, the enemy's 11th, 43rd, and 46th brigades suddenly used 40 to 50 small boats to cross under cover of darkness and land at Shizi Lin and Xiaochuan Sha (i.e., Shidong). Our army immediately fought bravely to meet them. By 6:00 AM, the enemy had been cut into two parts. One part fled towards Liuhe, and the other part fled towards Baoshan. Our army immediately divided its forces to pursue them. By yesterday morning (the 25th), the enemy had been completely cleared. At that time, our army found a military map in the pocket of an enemy officer killed in action, which contained a very detailed depiction of the terrain in the area where the clandestine landing took place.</p>
<p>Enemy Encircled at Yunzao Bang</p>
<p>The enemy who landed at Yunzao Bang and Zhanghuabang was given a fierce blow by our advancing troops. Most of them had been eliminated by yesterday. The remaining enemy soldiers are limited in number and have been heavily surrounded by our army. Although the remnants have repeatedly tried to break through, get on their ships and escape, they are unable to get out and are still struggling. A portion who retreated towards the riverbank were strafed by our machine guns, and countless were drowned.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) According to official sources, more than 1,000 enemy soldiers clandestinely landed at Yunzao Bang on the morning of the 23rd. Our army immediately gave them a head-on blow, and the fierce fighting lasted a day and a night. By about 10:00 AM on the 24th, our reinforcements arrived and joined in, launching a fierce attack on the enemy with hand grenades and machine guns. The enemy suffered heavy losses. Our army then advanced, covered in blood, under a dense rain of bullets. The enemy army could not withstand it and fled in panic to their ships. More than 500 enemy soldiers fell into the water and drowned. Currently, there is no trace of the enemy in Yunzao Bang.</p>
<p>Enemy Has Collapsed on Nanhui Beach</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that before dawn the day before yesterday (the 24th), approximately 1,200 enemy soldiers suddenly landed. Our army immediately surrounded them, first using concentrated gunfire to strafe them, and then engaging in bloody hand-to-hand combat. By yesterday morning, the entire enemy force had collapsed.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the day before yesterday morning, several enemy warships, accompanied by small boats, arrived at Nanhui Beach and began bombarding our shore with a barrage of artillery fire. After a while, small boats filled with infantry approached the beach, riding the tide ashore. Our defending troops feigned weakness, only engaging the enemy with a small force. The enemy took advantage of the situation to advance inland. Our main defending force, waiting for the enemy to gain an unsteady foothold, used the concentrated firepower of machine guns to strafe the entire line, and also used artillery fire to threaten the enemy's rear. The enemy was in a terrible state. Our army seized the opportunity to charge and engage in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy was overwhelmed, suffering heavy casualties. Of the approximately 1,000 enemy soldiers who landed in this battle, only about 100 survived. The damage to our army's [redacted] was not significant.</p>
<p>One Enemy Warship Sunk, One Damaged at the Mouth of the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that around 00:05 and 01:30 yesterday morning (the 25th), our air force repeatedly sortied over the Huangpu River and the mouth of the Huangpu River to bomb enemy warships. At that time, the moonlight was bright, and the sky was clear. All that could be heard was the rumbling of engines. The enemy warships at the mouth of the Huangpu River and on the Huangpu River surface shone searchlights and fired anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately. However, our pilots, bold, careful, and with superb skills, were still active in the enemy fleet. At that time, several bombs were dropped, and machine guns were fired. According to several Western passengers on the Canadian Empress of Canada, which arrived at the mouth of the Huangpu River the day before, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, they witnessed a gunboat anchored outside the mouth of the Huangpu River being sunk by us, and a destroyer being hit in the stern and severely damaged.</p>
<h3>Our Army Will Take Advantage of the Opportunity to Launch a Continuous Attack on the Enemy in the Hongkou and Yangshupu Areas</h3>
<p>According to official announcements, there have been no changes to our army's lines in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas on the 25th. It is heard that our army has decided to firmly hold the advantageous positions it has gained and take the opportunity to continue attacking the enemy.</p>
<p>Reliable sources state that the focus of the battle in recent days has shifted to the Wusong area. The outside world is extremely concerned about the situation of our army in the Hongkou area. After the reporter inquired with those responsible in military organizations, it was said that there would be no changes to our army's lines in Hongkou. Because the remnant enemy is already heavily surrounded by us, and its repeated counterattacks have suffered great losses, the enemy now has absolutely no ability to counterattack.</p>
<p>Enemy Reinforces Three Army Divisions</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The enemy forces in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas have fallen into a situation of exhaustion and lack of strength. The time of their destruction cannot be far off. The enemy has been in a passive position in the battles on this line from the beginning, constrained by our superior forces and unable to reverse the battle situation. Now, the enemy wants to resolve the crisis in the Shanghai battle situation, so it has reinforced Shanghai with three army divisions, hoping to land, contain the battle situation, and reverse its tragic position. In recent days, they have attempted to land at various ports in the lower reaches of our Yangtze River and along the coast of Nanhui, but have been repulsed by our army, suffering extremely heavy losses. According to special military dispatches, our reinforcements have arrived at key points along the coast and the river, and their strength is extremely strong. Although the enemy wants to fight to the death and open a bloody path, it is unable to cross the line.</p>
<p>Enemy Replaces Matsui as Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that due to the disastrous defeat in Shanghai, the enemy army has transferred three divisions from Japan to reinforce Shanghai, and has appointed General Iwane Matsui as commander-in-chief. In recent days, they have attempted to land along our rivers, but have been severely beaten by us. The enemy's casualties have been unprecedented since the start of the war. Even a regimental commander has been killed. The enemy army's unfavorable start has greatly weakened its morale.</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Bombard Pudong on the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Enemy warships in the Huangpu River opened fire on our Pudong positions around 4:00 AM yesterday morning. We immediately retaliated with heavy artillery. Then, around noon, our [redacted] artillery positions again used heavy artillery to bombard enemy warships in the Huangpu River and enemy positions in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Enemy warships in the Huangpu River again bombarded our Pudong positions at 9:50 PM last night. Our army calmly retaliated, and the artillery battle stopped after about 20 minutes. At 11:30 PM, the enemy warships resumed firing, and the two sides again bombarded each other. The artillery fire continued intermittently until 1:30 AM this morning, when it finally stopped.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Strafes Refugees</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Several enemy aircraft wantonly bombed the Pudong and Nanshi areas again yesterday morning (the 25th) and strafed our refugees at low altitude.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the Pudong area, enemy aircraft have been bombing and killing innocent civilians for days. Yangjing was hit by two bombs, killing and injuring more than 20 people. Casualties also frequently occurred in areas such as Lan Ni Du and Yang Jia Du. As a result, residents belonging to the Yangjing district (the Yangjing district includes Yangjing, Qichangzhan, Lan Ni Du, and Yang Jia Du) fled overnight for the past two days, seeking refuge to the south. Those on the road, old and weak, unable to travel due to illness, died everywhere, a truly pitiful sight. A reporter's investigation of Yangjing Town revealed that not only was there no one to be found, even chickens, dogs, and livestock were extremely rare, a veritable catastrophe. On the other hand, the Tangqiao district, located in the southern Huangpu area, which lacked markets and consisted mostly of farmers, was originally a safe rear area after the port of the 16 Shupu was closed. However, the enemy consistently followed its policy of creating chaos. During the day, aircraft flying over the Huangpu River dropped bombs from time to time, targeting slightly repaired houses. At night, artillery fire also often fell on the area, causing innocent villagers to suffer. Therefore, the villagers all fled to the Nanhui area, walking at least twenty miles. Their pitiful state was heartbreaking. Also, yesterday afternoon and at 9:00 AM today, Pudong and Nanshi were bombed by enemy aircraft. The casualties included the Shenggia Long Tin Foil Shop in Pudong, which was destroyed by bombs yesterday, killing the shop owner, a passerby, and a dog. Today, three people were killed near Gaochang Temple in Nanshi, all of whom were coolies and poor people.</p>
<p>Major Fires in Nanshi and Pudong</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning, the enemy aircraft bombed the vicinity of Gaochang Temple in Nanshi. The shanty towns and civilian houses near Guangdong Street and the riverside docks were all set on fire by the bombs. The fire spread until evening before being extinguished. In the Hongkou area, civilian houses near Wusong Road, Broadway Road, and Huishan Road also caught fire yesterday morning. The Nichi-Sei Company's warehouse in Zhangjia Bang, Pudong, also caught fire at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The fire was extremely fierce. With the help of the southeast wind, the sky over the Huangpu River was filled with black smoke, and the fire had not been extinguished by evening.</p>
<p>Enemy Wounded and Corpses Transported Back to Japan</p>
<p>The enemy transport ship Nojima, anchored at the Zhaoshangju North Wharf, and the enemy transport ship Chichibu Maru, anchored at the Zhaoshangju Central Wharf, carrying a large number of Japanese refugees, wounded soldiers, and corpses, a total of more than two thousand, left the port one after another at 12:10 PM and 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon to return east.</p>
<h3>Wusong Becomes a Scorched Earth</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle Lasts for 51 Hours; Residents' Houses Burned Down, Unspeakable Cruelty</p>
<p>Two Houses, Two Chinese</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Since the enemy army began concentrating warships and intense artillery fire in the middle of Saturday night, and a large squadron of enemy aircraft bombed in an attempt to cover the landing of infantry, our army fought valiantly to meet them. The fierce battle lasted for 51 hours. The entire town of Wusong was almost completely destroyed. Yesterday, the Longshan transport ship, flying the Italian flag, entered the port of Wusong at 9:00 AM and arrived in Shanghai at 12:00 PM. According to the ship's crew members, the Longshan entered the port at 9:00 AM, and the artillery fire at the mouth of the Huangpu River had ceased. The ship sailed along the Huangpu River to Shanghai. What they saw was that from Wusong to the power plant on Jungong Road, only two houses were somewhat intact. The rest of the houses were almost completely destroyed. The ship's crew members also said that from Wusong to Yangshupu, along the riverbank, they only saw two Chinese people on the riverbank, searching and feeling around as if catching fish. The ship's crew later witnessed these two people being spotted by the enemy army, who, without asking the reason, immediately shot and killed them with a burst of gunfire. The cruelty of the situation was indescribable.</p>
<p>Crimson Flames Soaring, Fire Raging</p>
<p>Reliable sources state that the Japanese troops who landed on the beach at the Wusong Zhanghua Bang Railway Factory Wharf were completely eliminated by 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Enemy warships fired sparsely. According to an official from a certain organization who came to Shanghai, from 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 24th to early in the morning of this day, more than a dozen enemy aircraft wantonly bombed all night, dropping more than a hundred bombs. The number of residents' houses destroyed was countless, and the cruelty was indescribable. The two major buildings of Yong'an Yarn Factory on Yunzao Road and the Great China Paper Mill across the river were hit by bombs and caught fire, with crimson flames soaring and the fire raging fiercely. The losses were no less than tens of millions. Furthermore, according to someone who came to Shanghai from Luodian, more than 300 enemy soldiers who landed at Beichuan Sha Shidongkou the day before yesterday initially fled to the Shengqiao area. Around 11:00 AM, they had reached Luodian City and were deployed along various main roads, searching pedestrians and burning houses. In the afternoon, they concentrated at the Jade Emperor Temple. When our ×× division heard the news and rushed to the scene, they immediately surrounded and annihilated the enemy. None of the enemy soldiers escaped. Therefore, yesterday, our army completely recovered the coastal areas such as Wusong, Shizi Lin, and Beishidong, and there was no trace of the enemy. Heavy troops were also dispatched to garrison them. From now on, although enemy warships are lined up on the sea in those areas, it will be difficult for them to cross the line.</p>
<h3>Large Amount of Military Supplies Found in the Ri-Hua Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>A large amount of military supplies was found by our army in the Ri-Hua Cotton Mill in Lujiazui, Pudong, the day before yesterday. It is now known that hundreds of boxes of guns, artillery, and ammunition, four anti-aircraft guns, and a disassembled aircraft were also seized in another warehouse the night before last. Compared to what was seized before, the bullets alone amounted to more than 1,000 boxes. It is estimated that the total value of these military supplies is more than one million yuan, which were probably stored by the Japanese army for use when they invaded our Pudong. Our side confiscated everything and transported it to the interior overnight. The Japanese army, upon hearing the news, was greatly alarmed and immediately sent several aircraft to scout the Pudong area yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Our Army Advancing at Nankou</h3>
<p>Fighting on the Jinpu Railway Line Remains Fierce; Enemy Retreats from Liangwangzhuang to Chaomidian; Part of Our Army Arrives at Yangliuqing</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Military news: Our army has concentrated on defending the high ground of the Juyong Pass in the Nankou area, and its defenses are extremely solid. On the night of the 24th, our reinforcing troops bypassed the flanks and attacked the rear of the enemy invading Nankou, killing thousands of enemy soldiers and capturing many prisoners. Our army is now actively advancing. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Heavy rain today on the Jinpu Railway line, no fighting. Our armored vehicles are in the south of [redacted], and part of the army is still building defensive works north of [redacted]. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] The enemy army in Jinghai has retreated due to the rear route to Yangliuqing being cut off, so there are only eighty to ninety people left. Enemy aircraft scouted Chen Guancun and Tang Guancun, dropping one bomb and being repelled. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] This morning, the enemy army attacked thirty to forty li northeast of Chen Guancun and was repelled. The enemy army in Jinghai City only has eighty to ninety people, and the station has thirty to forty people. Our [redacted] brigade has advanced from Chen Guancun. It is reported that part of our army has arrived at Yangliuqing, cutting off the enemy's rear route. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] News from transportation circles: The fighting on the Jinpu Railway line remains fierce. Due to the continuous heavy rain, low-lying areas have become marshes, so the Japanese army is transporting large numbers of wooden boats for use. On the 25th, many Japanese soldiers left Tianjin. There are large numbers of refugees near Duliu and Jinghai, who boarded boats to Tianjin on the 25th. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Near Guojiazhuang on the PingSui Railway line, a small group of enemy plainclothes bandits was discovered a few days ago attempting to sabotage railway traffic. After our army's continuous strict search and suppression, they have now been completely annihilated and cleared. All road and telecommunications traffic is smooth. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>[Baoding] The enemy in Liangwangzhuang has now retreated to the vicinity of Chaomidian and is being surrounded and dealt with by our army. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] After our army recovered Shangdu, Jiabus, and other places, enemy aircraft have been constantly flying to drop bombs. However, our defenses are tight, and the losses are minimal. Our troops launching from eastern Sui have advanced to the city of Zhangbei. A part of the Japanese army reinforcing Zhangbei was cut off from communication by our army and severely beaten, and the enemy could not withstand it and retreated again on the 22nd. The Japanese and puppet troops in Zhangbei City are now in an isolated state. Although the enemy still has small units reinforcing Guyuan and other places, they cannot exert their effectiveness because of our army's heavy interception everywhere. On the Nankou front, there was fierce fighting on the 22nd. The Japanese army attacking Nankou was originally two brigades, and three brigades of reinforcements have now arrived. On the night of the 21st, our army boldly launched an attack with superior fresh troops, and on the 22nd, it inflicted a major blow on the enemy. The enemy retreated after suffering heavy losses, and our army's advance was extremely smooth. The enemy attacking Yongding also suffered a disastrous defeat on the 22nd. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and attack, and a small part of the Japanese army was surrounded. In total, our army achieved its greatest victory on the front line of the PingSui Railway on the 22nd. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Three enemy aircraft flew to Zhangjiakou at 7:30 PM on the 22nd and dropped more than a dozen bombs near the East Station. Then, nine reconnaissance planes reconnoitered and circled in the high air over Zhangyuan for about half an hour before flying to Zhangbei. Also, an enemy bombing aircraft dropped three bombs in Xinghe County at 8:35 AM on the 22nd. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] According to a statement by the Japanese military authorities, Chinese and Japanese troops have engaged in fierce fighting in Jinghai, south of Tianjin, and the Japanese army has begun attacking the Chinese army's positions on the Jinpu Railway. Tianjin has had misty rain for many days, and the Hebei Plain has become a marsh. On the Nankou front, mountain floods have broken out, and the trenches have been flooded. Therefore, during the misty rain, all battles have been suspended except for occasional aircraft reconnaissance. Now that the rain has stopped, the battles have resumed. After the Chinese army moved east, most of them concentrated on the Jinpu Railway, and are now arrayed on the west bank of the Yongding River, determined to prevent the Japanese army from crossing the river. It is heard that the Chinese army is concentrated on the Gu'an-Pingbao Highway, crossing the Yongding River there. The river has risen very high due to the heavy rain for many days, so it is extremely difficult to cross by wading. At the same time, according to eyewitnesses, soldiers and military supplies are being transported from transport ships near Tanggu, landing in a steady stream. The ground there is muddy and difficult to navigate due to the rain, and the soldiers and horses are moving through it in a very embarrassed state. The highway from Dagu to Tianjin has become a muddy river due to the rain and the continuous transportation of military supplies by the Japanese army. It is widely believed in Tianjin that even if a major flood does not occur, the roads in the area, which are not covered with asphalt, will probably not be usable for several weeks. (Reuters dispatch from the 25th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>No Change in Qingdao Situation</h3>
<p>Authorities Encourage Stores to Open; Export of White Rice and Flour Prohibited</p>
<p>[Qingdao] The Rotary Club and the Lions Club issued a statement to several newspapers in Shanghai, saying that the radio station broadcast a message on Monday night that the situation in Qingdao was critical. This statement must be firmly denied. Both the Chinese and Japanese authorities are now united in their desire to prevent the occurrence of incidents. The representatives committee is currently working hard to ensure the safe transport and distribution of food. Although thousands of tourists are currently unable to return to Shanghai, there are adequate military forces here to protect them. (Reuters dispatch from the 25th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] The tense situation in Qingdao has eased slightly. After hearing news of a food shortage, the municipal government sent personnel to investigate and learned that the city has enough buckwheat flour stored to last for six months. In addition, Chairman Han agreed to transport food to help when necessary. Qingdao is now also prohibiting the export of white rice and flour. The Bureau of Social Affairs and the Police Bureau have issued orders for Chinese and Japanese stores that are closed to open, but those that have already closed have not yet opened, and those that have not closed have not continued to close.

<h3>Japanese Warships Sail into Chaoyang for Reconnaissance</h3>
<p>[Shantou] The Japanese warship Hayakaze sailed into the waters off Chaoyang on the 24th to survey the depth. When they realized that the defense forces were closely monitoring, they quietly left the area. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<h3>Coastal Defenses of Shantou and Xiamen Solid</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Most people from Xiamen and Taiwan left the area on the 24th. The coasts of Shantou and Xiamen are peaceful, and the defenses are solid. Taiwan is defended against our air raids, with lights extinguished at night. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>[Xiamen] A British destroyer arrived on the evening of the 24th. There is now one British warship and one American warship docked in Xiamen, and three Japanese warships. The evacuation of Taiwanese people was completed on the 28th. However, after the national army entered Xiamen, many people have sought refuge on Gulangyu Island. The market has now returned to normal, and the number of people moving has greatly decreased. Air defense exercises will be held regularly. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Efforts People Should Make in Wartime</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>The current war is a great national liberation war. Our nation's soldiers and civilians are determined to resist until the end. This war cannot be stopped until the invading troops of Japanese imperialism have withdrawn from our national territory.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, all of our compatriots should prepare for a long-term war. Everyone should fulfill their respective responsibilities in this war. However, most of our compatriots are inevitably confused and panicked by the onset of a major war due to their lack of knowledge. This hinders the prospects of the war effort. Intellectuals from all over the country should quickly unite to assist the Party and government authorities in guiding and organizing them, turning them into a great force in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>We know that in recent years, the government's implementation of the Baojia system and military training has already achieved considerable results. However, the personnel handling Baojia affairs in various regions do not have a full understanding of the nature of modern warfare and the significance of this national war of resistance. During this war, the effectiveness of the Baojia system still seems insufficient. Moreover, local Party headquarters, educational institutions, and professional organizations do not seem to maintain close cooperation with the Baojia organizations. How to ensure that the Baojia system exerts its full effectiveness in wartime and becomes the foundation of popular organization is something that intellectuals in various regions should strive for first.</p>
<p>Secondly, since this war is a long-term and arduous struggle for our entire nation, we must not be complacent due to a local victory, nor should we be discouraged by a temporary setback. We must maintain unwavering courage for a long time to achieve final victory. Therefore, in addition to providing strong assistance to the front-line troops in various aspects, the people in the rear must also devote themselves to various production and construction efforts in the inland, so that all the necessities of life can be self-sufficient. This is a necessary condition for maintaining the ability to resist the war. At a time when the flames of war have destroyed Shanghai's industrial areas and millions of workers have been displaced, inland production and construction are particularly urgent to resettle these urban unemployed workers. However, production and construction require considerable funds and sound planning. Under the government's effective control of national finance, it seems that there is still a way to make capitalists provide funds. What is hoped for is that outstanding individuals from the industrial and commercial sectors in various regions, with their knowledge and experience, will quickly formulate plans for wartime production and construction based on local conditions. With the cooperation of the government and capitalists, they should actively promote it, ensuring that the country's production capacity is not severely affected by the war.</p>
<p>In addition to promoting production, the people must also do their best to reduce the consumption of all materials. Because the military consumption of domestic materials is very large during wartime. For every point that the people reduce consumption, the military will increase its strength by one point. Therefore, all extravagant old habits in society must be thoroughly eliminated during wartime. This is also something that people above the middle class should strive for.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Does Not Abandon Treaty Obligations Regarding the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's Confidant Goes to Britain and France for Talks. Japan Still Quibbles Over Hull's Declaration.</p>
<p>[New York] Secretary of State Hull advised China and Japan yesterday not to engage in war. The New York Times commented on this, saying, "The Secretary of State has always maintained that the obligations accepted by the signatories of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact should be strictly observed. This position has not changed to this day. In short, U.S. foreign policy still aims to protect China's independence and territorial integrity." (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Under Secretary of State Welles is scheduled to travel to Britain and France tomorrow aboard the British mail ship "Queen Mary." This morning, Welles went to the White House to see President Roosevelt and had a long discussion. The President has decided to maintain an open door policy towards China and has ordered Welles to inform the governments of the relevant countries in Europe. Welles is expected to stay in Europe for four weeks, nominally for a private vacation trip, and will travel to southeastern France. He does not intend to stay long in Paris and London, but diplomatic circles here believe that Welles' trip has important political significance. Welles is considered a confidant of the President and cannot leave Washington for a moment when the situation is tense. Although he has long intended to travel to Europe, he has repeatedly postponed it due to the tense international situation. The current tension in the Sino-Japanese situation, in the view of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, is unprecedented in the past five years. However, Welles is taking time out to go to Europe at this time, and it goes without saying that his purpose is to explain the U.S. view to the governments of Britain and France. In addition, the general public attaches great importance to the statement made by Secretary of State Hull yesterday. Hull firmly stated that 'the lives, property, and interests of American citizens in China must be protected,' and said that the United States is willing to do everything possible to end the current dispute between China and Japan as soon as possible. Even if the governments of China and Japan do not actually follow this advice, Hull has already made it clear that although the principle of the open door to China has been damaged by Japan, the United States will still firmly maintain it. This statement is extremely important. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull said in an interview with reporters today that, with regard to American citizens in Shanghai, the State Department is currently studying methods of protection to prevent them from being threatened by hunger and disease. A large portion of the $500,000 in emergency funds approved by Congress last week will be allocated to relief efforts for refugees after consultation with officials from the American consulate in China and the Red Cross. When asked by a reporter whether the government would force American citizens in Shanghai to withdraw if the warring troops entered the public concessions, Hull replied that he had not received any official recommendations from American officials in Shanghai. It is said that Hull's move to ask China and Japan not to engage in war contains four intentions, of which three can be said, namely ㊀ exerting moral pressure on China and Japan to promote a peaceful resolution of the dispute, ㊁ giving a final warning to China and Japan before implementing the neutrality law, and ㊂ alleviating the increasing domestic pressure. President Roosevelt declared that he had read Secretary of State Hull's statement asking China and Japan for a ceasefire and expressed his deep sympathy. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding Secretary of State Hull's request that China and Japan cease hostilities, the official side here has not commented on it, but political circles say that 'no war has broken out between China and Japan.' This is because the Japanese government does not recognize that it has declared war on China, and the clashes between the two sides are merely an accidental event. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the proposal for a neutral zone in Shanghai, it is said that Japan's position remains unchanged, that is, the Japanese government cannot entrust the protection of its 30,000 overseas Chinese and its huge investments to other countries. Furthermore, the Japanese government believes that an indispensable condition for resolving the Shanghai incident is that China must fully comply with the 1932 ceasefire agreement. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Holds Second Meeting</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Far East Situation</p>
<p>[London] British Prime Minister Chamberlain met with Foreign Secretary Eden and Halifax, who was acting Foreign Secretary during Eden's vacation, for two and a half hours this morning to discuss the Far East crisis, paying particular attention to the Shanghai incident, and decided to continue the discussion this afternoon. It is learned that Chamberlain's return to London this time was specifically to discuss the situation in the Far East, and he is now scheduled to go to Scotland tonight for vacation, where he will stay at the King's Balmoral Estate villa. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[London] The National Executive Committee of the Labor Party issued a statement today, fiercely criticizing Japan's aggression against China, and requested that the British government, together with other member states of the League of Nations and countries that have signed treaties with China, especially the United States, take necessary measures to ensure that Japan respects international law and the rights stated in these treaties. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>[London] British newspapers continued to discuss the war between China and Japan today. The Conservative Party's Morning Post stated that, according to information received by the U.S. government from the Far East, there is little hope for an early end to the war between China and Japan, because the Japanese military seems to be willing to pay any price to achieve further victories in China. With Japan's stubborn attitude, the British government's proposal to neutralize Shanghai is unlikely to be realized. The Liberal Party's News Chronicle stated that 'Japan is now plundering China and threatening world peace. The reason for this is that the British government abandoned China in 1932 without cooperating with the United States. The United States has learned from the past and will certainly treat the proposal to cooperate with Britain with caution. We are now reaping the consequences of what Sir John Simon, the former British Foreign Secretary, sowed five or six years ago. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Opinions on International Intervention in the Sino-Japanese Incident Have Not Yet Been Unified</h3>
<p>France is the Most Active, Britain is Only Anxious, the U.S. is Still Watching, Germany and Italy are Neutral</p>
<p>[Geneva] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, France was the first to express a cautious and vigilant attitude, hoping to protect its interests in China and Vietnam, and advocated that France, Britain, and the United States unite and, if necessary, intervene effectively. Other countries have also made statements. Today, French newspapers reported that Britain intends to establish a common attitude among major European and American countries to force Japan to respect foreign interests, because the recent Shanghai incident has caused anxiety in the British business and financial circles. The United States' attitude expresses sympathy for China, recognizing China as an innocent victim, and the implementation of the U.S. neutrality law will be a huge loss to U.S. business, as Japan is an important customer of the United States. Therefore, the majority of public opinion favors a policy of non-intervention, while paying attention to and hoping for future progress with concern. Germany initially adopted a strictly neutral attitude, but has recently changed slightly. Official newspapers favor Japan, believing that if the Soviet Union aids the Chinese army and the Sino-Japanese conflict cannot be localized, Germany will have to choose between the German-Japanese agreement and the future possibilities of the Chinese market to determine its position. Italy will remain neutral in the foreseeable future, and in order to improve Anglo-Italian relations, it will not hesitate to participate in the joint actions of Britain, the United States, and France, even if it is not approved by the German government. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Telegraph's Rome dispatch stated that a large detachment of Italian troops has departed from Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, for the port of Massawa, where they will board ships and go to Shanghai to increase the strength of the troops stationed in Shanghai. The heavy losses of life and property in Shanghai have aroused serious attention from the Italian government and business community. Although the Italian government and the public express sympathy for Japan because Japan and Germany have signed an anti-communist agreement, they feel that Japan's war against China is an unexpected and painful event. Japan will find that its adventurous behavior in China is an extremely difficult task that wastes its strength and only makes the Soviet Union relatively stronger. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The financial advisor to the Chinese National Government, Stefano, the former Italian Minister of Finance, has returned to his country from China. On the way, he wrote an article, which was published in the local Stampa newspaper, stating that the scope of the war between China and Japan will expand, China's resistance force has increased compared to the past, and the process of China's unification will also be accelerated. There is no doubt that China will become a great, new, civilized, and strong country. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>470 Million Yuan Trade Contract Canceled</h3>
<p>The Economic Losses of Militaristic Countries are Serious</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter recently learned from reliable sources in the business community that trade contracts worth 470 million yuan ordered by our country's business community from the Japanese side have been completely cancelled since the outbreak of the Shanghai war. From this amazing figure, it can be seen that the effectiveness of our country's movement to boycott Japanese goods, promote national loans, and not buy or sell private goods has been minimal over the years. At the same time, it can also be seen that the economic losses suffered by militaristic countries are serious.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Enemy Support Association Convened a Discussion Meeting of Representatives from Various Groups Yesterday</h3>
<p>Representatives of Various Committees Reported on the Progress of Their Work. The Entire Assembly Observed a Moment of Silence for the Martyred Soldiers and the Deceased Civilians.</p>
<p>In order to report on its work, solicit opinions, and promote support work, the Municipal Anti-Enemy Support Association convened a discussion meeting of representatives from various groups on the afternoon of the 24th. A total of 57 representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, Red Cross Society, YMCA, Cultural Salvation Association, Wartime Service Corps of the Education Sector, Shanghai Branch of the Women's Comforting Frontline Soldiers Association, and Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps attended. The presidium of the Support Association elected Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, and Huang Yanpei as chairmen. First, Wang Xiaolai delivered an opening speech and reported on the organization and general situation of the work of the Support Association. Then, representatives of various committees reported. Luo Qinghua reported that the Fundraising Committee had already collected 570,000 yuan in donations, and the total amount, including the pledged but unpaid amount from various trade associations, was over one million yuan. This money will be remitted to the Military Affairs Commission in its entirety, while the Support Association's own expenses will be raised separately. Jin Runxiang reported that the Supply Committee had already supplied goods worth approximately 100,000 yuan, and goods worth approximately 110,000 yuan had been ordered. For donations, there were already more than 100,000 sacks of jute alone. Pan Gongzhan reported that the Relief Committee had established 129 shelters, accommodating more than 43,800 refugees. Including those run by various fellow-countrymen associations, a total of more than 100,000 people were accommodated, with monthly expenses for food and transportation of approximately 120,000 yuan (limited to those run by the committee). Efforts are currently being made to send them back to their hometowns. Pang Jingzhou reported that the Medical Relief Committee had established more than a dozen wounded soldier hospitals and one field hospital, with a total of 3,300 beds. The monthly expenses are over 90,000 yuan. In the future, for each additional wounded soldier, only medical and food expenses will cost approximately 50 cents per person per day.

<h3>The Central Bank Fully Exchanges Subsidiary Coin Notes</h3>
<p>Sufficient for Circulation</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously sent a letter to the issuing banks requesting them to issue more subsidiary coin notes to stabilize the exchange rate, etc. This was reported in a previous issue. According to the investigation, the Central Bank fully exchanged one-yuan notes and subsidiary coin notes before the outbreak of the Shanghai war, which was sufficient to meet the needs of the market. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, during the period when banks were closed, money shops were also closed, and there was a shortage of small notes in the market. Therefore, exchange shops took the opportunity to make profits by charging a premium. Now that the banks and money shops have been reopened for more than a week, the Central Bank has extended the time for exchanging one-yuan notes and subsidiary coin notes and is fully exchanging them. The number of people going to the bank to exchange money has decreased compared to before the war, which shows that there are already enough one-yuan notes and subsidiary coin notes in circulation in the market. However, the bank still fully exchanges them every day.</p>

<h3>Telegram from Xuzhou Compatriots in Shanghai to Commander Wang Jingjiu</h3>
<p>Outstanding Achievements Cover the World, Offering Grain Dares to Support the Rear</p>
<p>The Xuzhou compatriots in Shanghai, including Wang Xiangchen, former Commander of the National Revolutionary Army and Commander of the Guide Garrison, and Lu Yinquan, Cui Buwu, Su Shaoqing, Lou Ziming, Chen Zhusheng, Zhou Linwu, Wang Ailin, Luo Shenliang, and hundreds of others, because Commander Wang Jingjiu is from Xuzhou and has deep ties to his hometown, have initiated the ‘Xuzhou Compatriots in Shanghai Comforting the Anti-Japanese Soldiers Comforting Group’. They have raised funds to purchase military supplies, food, relief supplies, etc., to comfort those at the front lines. Preparations have been completed. Wang Xiangchen and Lu Yinquan have been appointed as the chief and deputy leaders of the group, respectively. They will depart soon to offer comfort. Xuzhou compatriots who wish to join the comforting effort can sign up at the Datong Company on Lao Yong'an Street in the French Concession at any time. It is recorded that the telegram from the group to Commander Wang is as follows: ‘To Commander Wang and all the soldiers at the front lines: When the savage Japanese invaded, the Battle of Shanghai resumed. Your army, under your command, bravely embarked on a long expedition, facing the stubborn enemy with divine might. Triumphant news arrived frequently, and meritorious achievements were made repeatedly. They seized the naval drill ground at the beginning of the battle and captured the Huishan Wharf in a bloody battle. Their courage in resisting is no less than that of their predecessors. Their outstanding achievements cover the world. We are all part of the nation, sharing its glory and disgrace. We should carry our bows to the front, and offer grain to support the rear. We are purchasing supplies and will present them soon. We anticipate that on the Jiang River, we will witness the annihilation of the Japanese in the Pudong area. We first send our condolences, hoping for your acceptance. The Xuzhou Compatriots in Shanghai Comforting the Anti-Japanese Soldiers Comforting Group bows in salute.’</p>
<h3>Important Speech by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>All Industries Should Expedite Resumption of Business Within Their Respective Scope, and Workers Should Maintain the Minimum Standard of Living</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, yesterday formally issued the following statement: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all citizens have been loyal, courageous, and energetic, expressing a unified spirit of resistance against the enemy. Our fellow businessmen have donated and raised funds, providing transportation and support. Their patriotic enthusiasm has been unmatched. The Chamber has also taken measures to assist important industries in the city to resume business in an orderly manner, such as banks, money shops, rice stores, and pawnshops. The order has gradually stabilized, and the market has been slightly alleviated. Further efforts depend on the brave soldiers at the front lines fighting valiantly and the people in the rear continuing to produce. Only then can there be long-term resistance, and only then can there be a final victory. Therefore, as far as factories are concerned, those in the war zone should do their best to find ways to relocate. Those in safe areas should set a time limit and start work as soon as possible. As for shops, in addition to those providing food, clothing, housing, and transportation, which are necessary for people's livelihood and must resume business as much as possible, other industries should also expedite resumption of business within their respective scope, so that goods can circulate and people's hearts can be stabilized. As for partners, friends, and employees, we should all share weal and woe. No matter how difficult it is, we should strive to maintain the minimum standard of living. This will not only reduce the pain of unemployment but also increase the power to resist the enemy. For those whose economic capacity is insufficient, it is hoped that they will reduce salaries and share the minimum standard of living. What day is today? The life and death of the nation are hanging by a thread. We live together, and we die together. The boundaries of the past, the divisions between labor and capital, have disappeared with the sound of gunfire. What lies before us is only the entire nation, the entire nation uniting to resist foreign aggression and cooperate to survive. All my fellow businessmen should understand this intention.</p>

Some enemy troops have achieved their goal of landing in several places, but our forces in Wusong, Zhanghuabang, Yunzaobang, Shizilin, Luodian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Liuhui, etc., have strong forces. When the enemy's position was unstable, they immediately attacked with all their strength. Our large reinforcements have arrived and are now taking a large encirclement formation, vowing to eliminate them. Except for Luodian Town, where there is still fierce fighting this morning, it will not be long before they can be annihilated. The rest of the areas are no longer a problem. As for the eastern part of Shanghai, although there has been no fierce fighting in recent days, there are still small contacts on the front line. Our army firmly defends its original defense, with confidence. It is estimated that there will be new developments in the entire war in three or two days.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops in Luodian Town Have Been Resolved</h3>
<p>Our Land and Air Forces Advance Together. It Is Not Difficult to Annihilate Them in a Short Time.</p>

Last night, all the reinforcements arrived in the area and closely connected with the front-line troops, gradually completing a three-sided encirclement. Since yesterday afternoon to this morning, the fighting between the two sides has been fierce. Dozens of enemy ships fired heavy artillery at the Zizhang area, and several aircraft dropped bombs in an attempt to prevent our reinforcements and destroy our positions. Our side also responded with heavy artillery. The gunfire continued all night. According to military sources, our army is strong, and the enemy is shocked. It is not difficult to annihilate them in a short time.</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that since enemy General Matsui Iwane led three divisions of reinforcements to Shanghai to assist in the battle, he concentrated his main force at the mouth of Wusong and repeatedly attacked various strongholds since the 23rd, but were bravely repelled by our defending troops. Yesterday morning, they landed from Chuanshakou again and launched a fierce attack on our Luodian, hoping to create a new base of operations. Our army fought with them all day. According to sources from a military agency this afternoon, our heavy troops have now entered Chuanshakou, and the enemy near Luodian has had its retreat cut off by us. They are now surrounded by our army on all sides, and the remaining enemy can be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Yesterday morning, under the cover of aircraft and heavy artillery, the main enemy troops landed from Chuanshakou again and launched a fierce attack on our Luodian area. At the same time, a large number of enemy planes flew to bomb. From morning to noon, they did not stop. Although our army made heroic sacrifices, they defended to the death and waited for reinforcements, without retreating at all. Until about 3 PM, our main reinforcements rushed to the scene and immediately joined forces to attack the enemy. Bullets were used up, and bayonets were exhausted. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and was in a terrible state. That night, our army drove the enemy out of Luodian Town, and there was no trace of the enemy in the town. Our army immediately pursued the victory, and the fighting continues to this morning.

<p>Our Planes Often Make Night Attacks and Drop Bombs, Enemy Warships Move Around to Avoid Danger</p>
<p>Enemy warships in the Hongkou area had a fierce artillery battle with our garrison in Pudong last night. The enemy sent most of its warships to Songkou, and the defenses here are weak. Fearing that our army in Pudong would take the opportunity to cross the river and attack the Japanese army's rear positions in Yangshupu and Hongkou, they fired to demonstrate. In fact, all the warships were extremely panicked. Our army took advantage of our planes making a night attack to bombard the ships with intensive artillery fire. The shells fell like rain, and the Japanese warships moved back and forth to avoid danger. The chaotic situation was indescribable. The gunfire did not stop until dawn.</p>
<h3>Enemy Carries Out a Massacre on Zhaofeng Road</h3>
<p>According to a carpenter who fled from Zhaofeng Road, yesterday the enemy searched house to house in the Zhaofeng Road and Broadway Road area, forcibly ordering residents to move out, otherwise they would set fire to the houses. The residents, who were in a difficult situation, had no choice but to leave and prepare to move elsewhere. Unexpectedly, the enemy suddenly forbade it, forcibly ordering them to wait until a large number of people had gathered before they were allowed to leave. The residents had no choice but to gather at the outdoor intersection. When about two or three hundred people had gathered, the enemy immediately surrounded them and fired with machine guns, and they all died. The carpenter, because he was more alert, took advantage of the fact that the enemy was searching each household and the guards were not tight, and immediately fled, thus escaping the tiger's mouth and avoiding the disaster. The enemy's brutal and beastly behavior can be seen from this.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, after 1 o'clock, enemy planes bombed the Gaochangmiao riverside pier area and dropped incendiary bombs. The riverside pier area was originally a shantytown with more than 2,000 huts. Once a fire broke out, it could not be controlled immediately. The fire spread quickly, and the enemy planes indiscriminately dropped bombs, so the fire department could not rescue them. As a result, the fire was blazing and the smoke was everywhere. The order in Gaochangmiao was disrupted, and the remaining poor people had to flee. Among the lodgers in the shacks, there were no shortage of traitors who set fires, so the fire continued to burn to Tianzhutang Street and Lao Guangdong Street all the way to the tram station, the Liu Yanghe Pharmacy at 740 Bansongyuan Road, and the Wanchen Sauce Garden at 743 opposite it. (The Gaochangmiao Post Office was fortunately preserved.) A total of more than 3,000 houses were destroyed. Fortunately, it was daytime, and there were few casualties. When reporters went to investigate this morning, four Japanese planes were flying low and circling in the Gaochangmiao area.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Chromium Tragedy Was Caused by Japan</h3>
<p>Our Embassy in England Received a Telegram</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the tragic bombing of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, the Chinese Embassy recently received a telegram from Nanjing stating that the explosives were not warship shells but airplane bombs. There were two yellow lines on the shell and Japanese markings. On the afternoon of the day of the incident, Japanese planes were bombing Pudong. The Japanese authorities have admitted this. As for Chinese planes, they did not take off at the time. Therefore, it is self-evident that the tragedy was caused by Japanese bombs. (Havas, Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>Dutch Overseas Chinese Donate 15,000</h3>

At 9:30 this morning, a Japanese naval headquarters car was speeding along the Bund towards Broadway Road when, at the center of the Foreigner Bridge, three Westerners in their own car were driving south from Broadway Road. The Japanese car, due to excessive speed, could not stop in time, and the two cars collided head-on with a loud crash, destroying the machinery.

<h3>Britain Decides to Take Positive Action on the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's Right-Hand Man Departs for Europe. Cooperation Between Britain and the United States Remains Uncertain</p>
<p>[London] Well-informed sources recently stated that the British government has decided that all actions regarding the Far East situation will be limited to protecting its own interests and the safety of its nationals and will no longer make diplomatic efforts to stop Japanese aggression against China. There are two reasons for this: (1) The British government's past efforts to mediate disputes between China and Japan have failed. (2) Isolationist elements are gradually gaining dominance in the United States, as can be seen from the U.S. plan to withdraw its nationals from Shanghai. Therefore, whether the United States can cooperate diplomatically with Britain is highly uncertain. However, it can be stated that Britain will definitely not follow the United States in withdrawing its nationals. If the British authorities in Shanghai request the government to continue sending troops to reinforce them, the government will comply at any time. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 25th)</p>

<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the enemy has been trapped in the Yangshupu Zhabei area. Not only has it been unable to advance, but it is also showing signs of collapse. If there are no reinforcements, it will be annihilated soon. The enemy, seeing the unfavorable situation, has sent a large number of reinforcements. Knowing that the original war zone cannot be expanded, it has had to seek an outlet along the river and coastal ports. Therefore, the expansion of the future war situation is inevitable. This is also something that our military authorities have long planned for.</p>
<p>The opinions of various countries on the matter of intervening in the Sino-Japanese conflict are still not unified. France is the most active, Britain is merely anxious, and the United States is still watching. This is due to the different depths of interest of each country, or the differences in their own positions and national policies. Different attitudes are obvious. However, they all agree that Japan is an aggressive and militaristic country. Since the September 18th Incident, our country's psychology of relying on others has long passed. We can only repay the enemy with the four words "calmly resist" and have no time to consider the attitudes of various countries.</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Passes Through Jinan En Route to Beijing</h3>
<p>Qin Dechun and Others Accompany Him</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Song Zheyuan, after leaving Píng (Beiping) for Baoding, immediately went to a certain place on the front lines to command his troops and make military arrangements, and was summoned to Beijing. After receiving the telegram, he immediately complied and went south. The Jinpu Railway provided a special train waiting north of Dezhou at Botou Town. In the afternoon of the 18th, Qin Dechun, the former mayor of Beiping, and others arrived in Botou by car from a certain place on the front lines and stayed overnight. At 6:40 PM on the 19th, they boarded the special train from Botou and arrived in Jinan at 11:30 PM that night. In addition to Qin Dechun, those accompanying him included Wang Yichen, Liu Zhizhou, Guo Zhilun, Lei Tongsang, Gu Fangbai, and a platoon of guards.

At 0:30 AM on the 20th, Song, Qin, and others continued south on the same train. Deng Zhexiding and others also went south on the same train. According to what he told reporters, this trip to Beijing is to meet with the authorities and ask for instructions. He will return north as soon as he has completed his business in a few days.

<h3>Our Troops Recapture Shangdu; Japan Actively Reinforces Rehe in Recent Days</h3>
<p>Part of Force Also Stationed in Duolun, Chabei; Puppet Troops Also Retreat East, Gathering on Border Between Rehe and Chahar</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Dispatch: After the bandit-puppet troops in Chabei were reorganized into the puppet "Inner Mongolian Army" after being unified by Tong Chang (Li Shouxin), they underwent a long period of training, reorganization, and elimination. Although nominally nine divisions, they were actually only a mixture of the old Rehe security forces of Li Shouxin's troops (namely the current 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th divisions) and the Mongolian troops gathered by Prince De (namely the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th divisions and Zhuo Shihai's security forces), totaling only over ten thousand men. Since the Japanese side has decided to sacrifice the puppet troops in Chabei and focus on consolidating the Chabei plan, they have stationed Li Shouxin's direct descendants, Liu Jiguang, Yin Baoshan, Wang Zhenhua, Bao Zichen, and other four puppet divisions in the Shangdu Shangyi Nanhaogian area. Another order was issued to concentrate all of Yi Shaoxian's puppet 5th division in Pingding Fort, all of Bao Anpu's puppet 6th division in Baochang, and all of Bao Yueqing's puppet 8th division in Duolun. The above-mentioned puppet troops have already been deployed. As for Mu Kedengbao's puppet 7th division, the puppet Nite clan, and Jabu Temple, in addition to the puppet troops, there is a Japanese division trapped in the Fengning and Dagezhen areas of western Rehe.</p>
<p>As for the defensive works of the Japanese puppet troops, which are currently being rushed to completion, they are in the Fengning County, Huogezhen, Waimengouzi, and Shanghuangqi areas along western Rehe, where the situation is extremely tense. Those already completed in Chabei include the construction of solid defensive works from the Heihe River to Guyuan and Baochang. As for their combat plan, the puppet 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th divisions stationed in Shangdu, Shangyi, Zhangbei, and Nanhaogian areas are to be used as support troops. However, the Japanese puppet plan is not to make major sacrifices in this regard. If there is a war, the puppet commander will offer a slight resistance and plan to retreat entirely to Duolun and join forces with the puppet troops originally stationed in the Duolun Guyuan Pingding Fort area to defend to the death. This is the puppet army's official front line of defense. Therefore, a large amount of military supplies and food have long been stored in Duolun Pingding Fort and other places, preparing to resist persistently in these places.</p>
<p>On the 8th of this month, according to sources, the Japanese Kwantung Army has been dispatching large numbers of divisions to Rehe in recent days. The Kawahara Division, which has already been mobilized, is about to arrive in Chengde in its entirety, and more troops are continuing to arrive. What kind of troops and their numbers remain to be investigated in detail. The 4th Cavalry Brigade of Jishi Muroyoshi has also set off from Panyang to Chifeng. It is reported that after the troops gathered in Chifeng, a part of them will be transferred west to garrison Duolun in Chabei. At the same time, Zhou Yongqing, the puppet commander of the 4th District of Chengde, was appointed as "Commander of the Front Line." Zhou and his subordinate Liu Laiqing's four infantry regiments have gathered and are awaiting orders in the Fengning Dagezhen area of western Rehe. In addition, 24 new enemy planes have arrived at the Chengde airport for wartime use, including 20 bombers and 4 reconnaissance planes. Judging from the sudden and active increase in troops, it is certain that they have other ambitions. According to general observations, it is generally believed that the Japanese side, because its entrenched troops in Píng and Tianjin (Beiping and Tianjin) are hindered by a large number of troops to the south, and the Nankou garrison is attacking its rear, and because the Ping Sui Railway from Nankou to Jin Sui is the contact point for the traffic of the three provinces of Sui Jin and Chahar, increasing reinforcements can respond from one place to another, which is extremely convenient. Therefore, it deeply feels the danger of its troops now entrenched in Píng and Tianjin, so it has decided to increase troops in Rehe, attempting to invade Dushikou from Chicheng County, Liaoning Province, and to try to peek into Chicheng and Longguan in order to cut off the retreat route of our Nankou garrison. At the same time, in western Rehe and Chabei, it will strengthen the strength of bandits and puppets to prevent a sudden attack by the Jin Sui army. If the Japanese army's plan can succeed and be realized, it will not only exempt its entrenched troops in Píng and Tianjin from the disadvantage of being attacked on both sides, but also make eastern Hebei and northern Chahar, and even the entire territory of Chahar Province, connect with the puppet state of "Manchukuo". The viciousness of its intentions can be imagined.</p>
<p>According to people from outside the Pass, after the main force of the puppet troops in Chabei moved east to gather on the border between Rehe and Chahar, they have established contact with the Japanese puppet troops in the Fengning Jingpeng area of western Rehe. Duolun has now become the transportation hub of the Japanese puppet side and also the military center of the Japanese puppet side. Recently, the Rehe puppet army heard that there were a total of about one division led by Zhang Yizhe, who has defected from all of Chabei, stationed at the Heilongjiang River. There is also Gao Jiangong's division stationed in the Datai area (it is said that their numbers are all said to be from the Kwantung Army, and most of them are estimated to be from the three northeastern provinces). In addition, the nephew of Yi Shaoxian, commander of the puppet 5th division, was allowed to form a puppet army brigade. He has now established a puppet brigade headquarters in Pingding Fort and is sending people to recruit from all over, or forcibly drag strong men from various counties and force them to join the army. It is said that there are already more than 300 people. The guns and guns used are all supplied by the Japanese army and are completely in the style of sending Han Lianchun.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Boatmen Enthusiastically Patriotic</p>
<p>Boatmen such as Zhou Guishu from the Dongmen Fu River have stated that in the face of national crisis, the masses should embrace the determination to sacrifice and save the country. In recent days, various transportation needs have required many boats. They gathered thirty-odd boats of all sizes and publicly elected Zhou Guishu, Yang Guozhi, Xu Lianke, Jiang Guirong, and others as representatives to meet with County Magistrate Wen and submit a list of the tonnage of each boat and the number of partners to the county government, stating their willingness to serve and await transportation orders to express their patriotism. County Magistrate Wen praised the boatmen for their enthusiasm in saving the country, which was truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Han Traitor from Taixing Arrested</p>
<p>The intelligence team of the support association reported that Li Zonggui of Yanggang Township, the third district of Taixing, was suspected of being a traitor. They immediately reported to the martial law headquarters, which sent personnel to Taixing to arrest Li and found a [blank] brand box gun. He was escorted to Cheng on the 16th for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Enemy Goods Store Huaming Smashed</p>
<p>The Huaming Porcelain Store at Yuanmen Bridge in Yangcheng has been selling enemy goods and operating Anzhu mosquito incense at low prices, long resented by merchants of national goods. In the past, when checking smuggled goods, the store had several boxes. Suddenly, an enemy merchant came to the Chamber of Commerce to resist. At this time of tense resistance against the enemy, the store still openly sold enemy goods, which aroused the blood of patriotic youth. At 10:00 AM on the 20th, dozens of young people went to the store and destroyed and threw away the enemy goods on display, making a mess on the ground. For a time, onlookers blocked the road and applauded.</p>
<h3>Taixian</h3>
<p>Prices Rise in Jiangbei</p>
<p>Due to the recent Shanghai war, prices in Taidong and other counties in Jiangbei have been rising steadily. In particular, kerosene, matches, and various foreign goods have become scarce due to the lack of sources from Shanghai, and prices have increased by 10-20% across the board. Because food prices are in the autumn grain harvest season, except for wheat, they have not risen significantly. In order to prevent merchants from raising prices and manipulating the market under false pretenses, the county government has issued a special order to the police organs in each district to strictly investigate and ban it, and to detain the merchants in question for investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Controlling Price Gouging</p>
<p>The Jiaxing County Government, fearing that unscrupulous merchants might manipulate the prices of daily necessities due to the serious situation, has formulated methods and issued notices that all prices should be based on August 10th as the standard. If prices need to be increased, they must be verified and implemented. Unscrupulous merchants are not allowed to manipulate prices privately, and measures must be taken to stop boatmen from raising prices to take advantage of traffic.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Downed Enemy Plane on Display</p>
<p>Our air force shot down an enemy plane in Tou Peng, Manshan Township, on the 15th. In addition to escorting the two enemy pilots to the district headquarters, the county government has ordered the local public security bureau to dismantle and transport the plane to the city for display at the county government starting from the 20th.</p>
<p>More Than 500,000 Refugees</p>
<p>From the 14th to the 18th, the Qiantang River ferry boats in Xiaoshan carried no less than 500,000 refugees. The overcrowding of boats and the large number of vehicles were beyond imagination. Those traveling from Xiaoshan to Shaoxing continued along the road without end, and the business of restaurants and food stalls increased tenfold. Also, the price of vehicles and boat fares increased fivefold compared to normal. On the 17th, the Yiyong police from the Xixing Zhuangding team were sent to suppress the situation and prevent high vehicle and boat fares. All evacuees were hired boats and escorted.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Five Han Traitors Captured</p>
<p>Near Chen Maoji in the northeast countryside, a group of people recently organized the Sanyi Religion, also known as the Bao Huang Party (Protect the Emperor Party), specializing in recruiting foolish followers and spreading false rumors to mislead the public. After investigation by the district office, it was found that it was actually a traitorous organization plotting against the government. Therefore, a team was dispatched to arrest five people and escort them to the county for strict interrogation. In addition, Zhao Rixin and others have recently been selling Rendan in various counties in northern Anhui. After investigation by the Dingyuan County Government, Zhao and others were suspected of being traitors. Zhao Rixin, Zhao Rijie, Yang Chuncai, Yang Ruilin, Lu Jiaxing, and other six people were arrested and escorted to Hefei for interrogation on the 19th.</p>
<h3>An Open Letter to Our Soldiers from a Swiss Miss</h3>
<p>Praising Our Army's Strict Discipline and Attentive Hospitality</p>
<p>An open letter to Chinese soldiers from Swiss Miss Ross Cuffer, whose original text reads: "Before recalling my memories, please allow me, my brother 'Edward,' and my doorman 'Liu Ge' to express our deep gratitude to you for all the conveniences you have given us during our dangerous journey in the front line of Zhao Feng Road. After being given food, drink, and Chinese clothes by the kindness of the refugees and soldiers in the 'Qinhui' cotton mill, we met again and said goodbye. Then, a soldier with a letter from his general accompanied us to the North Railway Station, hoping to transfer to the concession from there. First, after leaving the cotton mill, we tried to cross the city center, but because the battle was fierce there, we turned to Jiangwan Road. After walking a few steps, we realized that it would be dangerous to continue along the railway, because Zhabei was being heavily bombed at that time. So we walked along Jiangwan Road again and met many admirable Chinese soldiers whose treatment of us was particularly attentive. That night, the moon was full, and we traveled and talked with the brave soldiers who accompanied us. At this time, my old doorman 'Liu Ge' acted as a translator. Before we knew it, we arrived in Zhenru at 2:30 AM. Because we were thirsty, we searched for teahouses everywhere but could not find any, because the doors were open but all closed. We arrived in Nanxiang late. If it were peacetime, we should have taken the road to Zhongshan Road. At that time, we followed Jungong Road and Nanmingxing Bailinan Road. I thought the last half hour of the journey seemed the longest, because this journey was often taken by us during our suburban travels, and it seemed shorter. My brother and I were very satisfied with the feelings we gained this time. I will never forget the Chinese soldiers who gave us kindness and courtesy. Respectable soldiers, admirable is your bravery and noble morality. Our feelings are as described above. Please extend my gratitude to you again." (Translated from the French Shanghai Daily, August 25, 1937)</p>
<h3>Brief Report on Rear Area Work</h3>
<p>Relief</p>
<p>Refugees from the war zones are fleeing into the concessions in droves. Although various organizations and charitable groups have set up shelters to accommodate them, there is still a sense that there is not enough space for everyone. As a result, many refugees continuing to flee the war zones from areas such as Hongkou still face the hardship of having nowhere to settle. The situation is dire. Currently, refugees from the war zones are still arriving in large numbers, and it is hoped that all sectors will find ways to accommodate them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the burial team of the Shanghai Relief Committee continued to collect and bury over eighty bodies from the Nanjing Road tragedy. Together with the previous burials, the total is over one hundred and fifty bodies, all transported to Rihui Port for burial. Furthermore, twenty-odd members from the first and second teams were dispatched to the war zone, together with the Buddhist monk rescue team, to engage in burying dead soldiers and civilians.</p>
<p>Since its establishment on the 14th, the Yuyao Native Place Association Shelter has accommodated over four hundred people and sent over five hundred people back to their hometowns. Therefore, the work is quite intense. It is also said that Messrs. Jiang Quanmao, Gao Peiliang, Qi Shaoqi, Xu Xiajun, and Zheng Wentong of the same association have all made substantial donations.</p>
<p>Repatriation</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society has already begun repatriating refugees. The Society, having heard that the Shanghai Relief Society has several ships ready to transport refugees out of the country, consulted with the Relief Society and obtained ship tickets for the refugees. This morning, the Society dispatched a relief team to escort over five hundred refugees from the shelter to the Suzhou area.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday, various Shanghai native place associations held a joint meeting at the Du Hall of the Pudong Native Place Association. Over thirty representatives from various native place associations attended to discuss issues related to relief and repatriation to their hometowns. Finally, it was decided that the Quanzhe Public Association and the native place associations of the five counties of Putuo, Rushi, Changshu, Haiyan and Qidong would convene another meeting at the same location at 4:00 PM on the 28th of this month, in order to cooperate fully. The Jiangyin Wuxi Joint Shelter has successively repatriated over six thousand refugees. Yesterday (the 25th), the sixth batch of over seven hundred refugees, led by Gao Shifeng, were transported to Wuxi on eight civilian boats.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association repatriates refugees to their hometowns every day. It is reported that over thirty-six thousand refugees have already been sent. At 10:00 AM yesterday, another one thousand five hundred refugees were sent off on the Shunfu Wheel, and five hundred were transported on the Longshan Wheel in the evening. It is also learned that there are still over nine thousand refugees in the nine shelters who have not yet been sent away.</p>
<p>Since the Wujiang Shanghai Native Place Association began handling the accommodation and repatriation of refugee fellow villagers, as of yesterday, over five hundred people have been admitted and over two hundred have been repatriated to their hometowns successively. Yesterday afternoon, the third batch of refugees was sent off, with approximately three hundred people. In the future, if there are fellow villagers from the county who need accommodation or repatriation, they can request registration from the association.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sichuan Shanghai Native Place Anti-Japanese Support Association completed arrangements with the Railway Bureau for two train carriages. Starting today, registered fellow villagers returning to their hometowns will first be sent to Nanjing, and then the Minsheng Company will be contacted to dispatch ships for transport back to their hometowns. All train fares and boat tickets will be funded by the association. The number of people is estimated to be over one hundred.</p>
<p>Comforting</p>
<p>Yesterday, a German man named Busckist from the Red Cross on Jinghai Ge Road, brought cigarettes and other items to comfort the wounded soldiers in our hospital, and praised the bravery of our army, saying that their spirit was worthy of admiration and that they dealt a blow to the invaders, and wished us victory in the war of resistance. Before leaving, he said that these were just small tokens to express his feelings, showing that foreigners also sympathize with our side.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, members of the Children's National Salvation Association, led by Chen Juanjuan and others, brought flowers to visit Captain Ren Hongpei and crewman Qu Hui of the Air Force wounded in action, and a certain Battalion Commander of the Army at a certain hospital.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the progress of its work, the Wartime Service Corps of the educational circles of this city has borrowed Yunzhong Girls' Middle School on Avonne Road as its office address. The Corps has been working hard to raise comfort supplies to be remitted to the front lines in the near future.</p>
<p>The Comforting Anti-Japanese Soldiers Fundraising Team organized by the National Jinan University Students Staying Behind Association has already raised donations of one hundred and thirty-eight yuan and two jiao and five fen, as well as other local products. After raising five hundred yuan, comfort items will be purchased separately and sent to the front lines.</p>
<p>Fundraising</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee is actively fundraising internationally and in all sectors of the city in order to expand relief efforts for refugees in the war zone and to fund their return to their original homes.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Educational Association's Anti-Japanese Support Association's Steel Collection Office has moved to Jinhua Elementary School, Sanxingfang, Beller Road, French Concession. Currently, the front lines are in greater need of sacks and iron wire. It is hoped that all sectors will send more of these two items. The Association can also send staff to collect and forward them to the front lines. The Joint Charity Relief Committee of this city has specially established a Relief Committee for War Zone Refugees. Now, with the daily increase in refugees, the original shelters are no longer sufficient. The food situation is also extremely dire. In addition to sending letters to all sectors to solicit vacant houses, there is also a great need for food, cash, and transport vehicles. It is deeply hoped that enthusiastic people in society will generously lend or donate, which will benefit the disaster victims immeasurably. The office is located in Renji Hall on Six Ma Road, telephone number 9-960. Also, the Association received donations from all sectors yesterday, including 100 yuan each from Zheng Zhou, Anonymous, Song Ji, and Mr. F.N. Matthews, 150 yuan from Que Zhuren, 100 yuan from the Oriental Hotel fundraiser Chen Songquan, and many others, too numerous to list, totaling over 2,400 yuan.</p>
