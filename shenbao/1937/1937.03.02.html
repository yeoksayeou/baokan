<p>時評</p>
<h3>印度國民大會黨選舉獲勝的意義輔</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>上月底路透社自孟買傳來的電訊。謂印度新憲法下各省選舉的最後結果。全印國民大會黨已經獲得空前的勝利、在孟買與瑪特拉斯等行政區及聯合省•中央省•貝哈爾•沃里薩省。大會黨都佔絕對的多數。在孟加拉•阿薩密•與西北邊省。大會黨為最大的單一政黨。祗有在本哲布與辛德二地。大會黨所得的票數較少。大會黨在瑪特拉斯的勝利尤為驚人。因為該地最近十四年來。向為正直黨的大本營。而此次選舉結果。正直黨竟告慘敗。僅得十六席。而大會黨則得一百五十九席。並在上院四十六席總數中佔二十六席的多數。這次全印國民大會黨之所以能夠獲得這樣空前的勝利。主要的原因自然是由於他們聯合各階級各黨派的選民。為着印度民族的獨立解放而奮鬥。</p>
<p>這次英屬印度各省選舉的舉行。是印度新憲法實施的初步程序。這新憲法是大英帝國主義統治印度的新法寶。於一九三五年通過發表。預定今年四月一日實行。新憲法規定印度為一聯邦國家。包括英屬印度十一省及印度土邦五六○個。現在先由英屬印度各省舉行選舉。組織議會•然後再由英屬各省選出上院代表一五六人與下院代表二五○人。各印度土邦選出上院代表一○四人及下院代表一二五人。組織聯邦上議院及下議院。在新憲法的規定下。印度除了得到極有限度的自治權外。所有重要的統治權仍然操在大英帝國所特派之印度總督的手中。所以國民大會派對這新憲法採取堅决的反對態度。會長尼赫魯並說這憲法是“奴隸的練索。”非打破不可。</p>
<p>國民大會派卽然堅决反對這“奴隸的練索。”但現在為什麼又參加這憲法規定下的各省選舉而且還獲得空前的勝利呢。這種態度驟看起來。好像是很矛盾的。但其實却有大道理在。這於去年十二月底在費茲浦舉行的全印國民大會所發表的宣言中說得非常明白。我們可引述如下。“大會反對新憲法的全部。並確切聲明。凡是由外國勢力製定的憲法及妨害印度人民的主權與不承認印度人民有統治其政治經濟組織之權力的憲法。都是不能接受的。為了阻止外來之統治與剝削勢力的增强。大會决定參加未來省議會的競選。但是大會選出代表參加議會的目的。絕不是遵從新憲法而是設法打破它。結束它。”</p>
<p>這次各省選舉的結果。大會黨已得極大的勝利。因此他們粉碎新憲法的目的。頗有成功的希望。至於大會黨此後是否參加省政府的組織。上次大會沒有决定。而须留待本月中在德里舉行的執行委員會决定。不管這问題將來如何决定。全印國民大會之反對新憲法的態度是不會改變的。上次大會宣言說“不管這間題的决議如何。我們必須記住。大會是絕對反對這新憲法而抉不與之合作的。我們的目的祗有一個。就是新憲法的告終。因此我們必須多方努力。以阻止這聯邦憲法的施行。因為這憲法的作用是要使帝國主義的與封建的利益永遠統治着印度全國。而阻止一切走向自由的進步。”</p>
<p>印度的民族解放運動。近年在全印國民大會的領導下已經走上明確的路線。這次國民大會黨在各省選舉中所獲得的空前優勢。尤為解放運動勝利的象徵。處在半殖民地地位的我們。一方面固當為印度民族解放運動的前途慶賀。一方面也該切實反省。設法把自己從半殖民地的陷阱中拯教出來。</p>

<h3>我們的醫事建設在那裏？</h3>
<p>— 花新人</p>
<p>目前很時新的有一種主義標榜着在我們衛生界裏，也就是一班高級衛生官坐在高大的洋樓舒適的辦公室內喊出的口號，就是所謂“醫事建設；”我們平心靜氣底細想，這正如同“坐在沙發上寫普羅文學”一般，因為這是他們想獲得民衆的信任，正如同用政治手婉來廷長政治生命的政客一樣。</p>
<p>我們的醫事建設在那裏？現在我將美國和我國的統計列出再來談判：</p>
<p>（甲）中國人口為400,000,000，全國合科學醫有7,881人，（指領有部憑者）平均每五萬人口中有一位醫師，全國有護士為5,000人，平均每80,000人口中有一位護土，全國有病床50,000隻，平均每萬人口中有一病床。而病率為3％</p>
<p>（乙）美國人口為106,775,046全國總共有醫師140,000人平均每900人口中有一醫師，全國有護士2,3800人，平均每600人中有一護士，全國病床有990,903隻，平均每百人有一床位而病率為0.15％</p>
<p>我們的醫事建设在那裏？我要問問我們賢明的當局，在五萬人口中只有一位醫師，這是為民保健麼？每萬人口中有一隻病床，這是公醫制度麼？我要問一聲我們的醫事建設在那裏？我國每年平均死亡人數為六百萬，寃死人數也是六百萬，（指無醫藥享受者而言）每年因超格死亡之經濟損失，花卅萬萬元之上，假若以這種經費移來建設，我們可以完成大學一千所，小學十萬所，醫院五千所，自來水廠六百所，公路十萬里，飛機二萬架，鐵路三萬里，工廠八百所，再看我國人民平均壽命，只能活到三十歲。而同時只能在社會上服務十五年，在這些數月統計字上觀之，大約總有點“驚人”吧！目前我們所迫切需要的是什麼？當然是“醫事建設”。</p>
<p>在醫事建設口聲下，第一步工作就是醫務人員的增加，我們要减輕死亡率，要增進人民健康，並不要標榜新主義和喊著動聽的口號，可以完成的，而是要將事實用實踐的方法去證明的，所以我說要靠他們一些特任簡任的衛生官去完成這種工作，不是一件容易的事，再說吧：“病死”是人間最不幸的事，你想五萬人口中只有一位醫師，我們想病了怎樣辦？另外我們在每個醫院的門診部中，就可以看見病人的多，真如山陰道上擁擠不堪，他們是怎樣的在急切企求醫者的一顧呀！當然有錢人：和貴人一類的要人，病了可以私人請一位隨從醫師作為專用，再或者找一位外國醫師去檢查，甚至於可以出國去療養，然而其他一般窮人呢？所以要復興民族，要增厚國力，醫事建設是目前迫切需要的：這次衛生署舉辦的甄別醫帥考試，在原則上我們感覺着是適合應用於醫事建設底絛件下，然而在方式上，我們是有幾點要提出商洽的：</p>
<p>（第一點）請問醫師甄別委員會的委員產生條件和標準是怎樣？</p>
<p>（第二點）這次甄別的意義是在什麼地方？是在為民保健麼？是在作醫事建設麼？是在敷衍一般公意的要求嗎？</p>
<p>（第三點）在甄別辦法第五條第一二欵內的規定是合法的麼？</p>
<p>（第四點）旣然去甄別醫師考試，為什麼要免一半，及全部，這不是內在的矛盾麼？不及格的費用為什麼不退回？</p>
<p>醫師是一種高尚圣神的自由職業，而且也是操着人間生殺之權的，政府對此自應加以一番整理，我們知道十八年的變通給憑辦法，和本年的甄別辦法，可以說是我們歷史上的污點，也可以代表着我們過去教育的失敗。</p>
<p>“庸醫殺人”自當取締，我們也不願意因有幾個害羣之馬，被人稱為庸醫的來破壞整個醫師界的名譽，然而我們試想這些所謂庸醫是如何的產生來的，所以政府這次來舉行甄別的意義，我想當然不外乎，想將現行社會醫事制度加以調整，但是我們希望在調整中，不要忘記了客觀的環境與條件𦆵對！否則又將要走到勞民傷財的地步。</p>
<p>醫事建設並不是口號，而是一件實際的工作，有多少貧病的同胞在期待着我們去做我們應做的工作，我們肩背上應負的責任是如何地重大，然而目前一些高級衛生官吏，太不認識自己所處的地位與應負的責任了：</p>
<p>過去社會醫事制度所取的途徑，是有許多錯誤的地方，做衛生工作的領袖，目的只在謀個人的和自己一派一系的出路，而忘却了為多數貧病的民衆謀健康，因此醫事建設是一個口號，民衆也就感覺到灰心失望了，假若是今後衛生界的眼光不注意於社會的底層工作，和一般貧苦大衆的本身健康，我敢說中國的醫事建設運動便不能說是成功！醫事建設事業不是口號，而是一件很艱巨的工作，現在離着成功的時候還是那樣遙遠，假若我們是由一點一滴做去，假若我們是由以大衆健康福利為出發點，假若不是口號，我深信成功是必然的。</p>
<h3>發展醫藥要使國人認識新醫藥（下）</h3>
<p>— 夏承道</p>
<p>舊醫言“西醫長外科，中醫善內科”，這更是無稽之談，外科之病，除全身症候之外，（如發熱，頭痛，昏暈等，）必有一處焉，或為紅腫，或為糜爛，或為化膿流血，或變形損肌，新醫所謂局部症候是也，內科亦然，亦必有一處焉，或為化膿流血，或變形損肌，而後全身疾候相應而生，諸症中之腦出血，胸腎之痛有潰瘍肝臟硬縮必為水臌，心瓣缺損乃起浮腫，癆瘵之肺空洞常如岩隙，傷寒腸潰爛或至破穿，外呈何候，內必其何變，此徵之病理解剖，騐之數千百人，而莫之或爽者也，由此觀之，內外科之病狀同也，特在內者難見，而舊醫自欺欺人，便以肝旺陰虛痰多風濕之言糊塗塞責了之，而在外者，衆目所見，舊醫不能以糊塗欺人，且不解手術，便曰“此病屬外科，非彼所善，”然則新醫豈只長外科？卽內科皮膚花柳科婦科，產科，小兒科，眼科牙科鼻喉耳科，等等，各有各的特別設備，各有專門醫師，科科都是新醫之長處，不過一般敎士醫院看護出生之非正式醫師，他們僅僅懂得幾件西藥，正如舊醫懂中藥之用途，患知其然而不知其所以然一樣的毛病，譬如耶蘇敎徒罵崇拜鬼神的人，為迷信，然而耶蘇教徒崇拜耶蘇上帝，又何嘗不是迷信？以迷信罵迷信，實等於狐狸笑貓！</p>
<p>舊醫未曾讀過動植物學物理化學生理學等等他不明人體各器官之作用，不知日常食物的構造及性質所以禁止病人不可葷食，連世界公認的病人滋養食物，如雞蛋牛奶等，亦不可食，反而令病人食萊菔梗鹹菜根等，難消化的東西，病人本來胃口不好，食這些不能開胃口的東西，三餐越不能下咽，如臥病稍久，因缺乏滋養植物，身體,　　羸瘦，非特在病時耗去的體力精神不能速卽恢復，而等於餓死者亦復不少，舊醫之缺乏理智，誤害病人，可謂極矣，新醫對於病人之飲食，有特別滋養療法，亦在療法中佔一部分很重要的位置，有透澈的理論，有豐富的實騐，有特製的滋養食物，有特別的設備，莫不求帮助病人從速恢復健康之體力與精神，大概新鮮的食物而富於滋養料又易消化者，都適合病人之攝生，但是亦有例外的，諸如患糖尿病的人，不可食糖，患精神病的，不可食有刺激的東西等等也，舊醫輒令病人食素，謂葷物生風，生濕，生痰，等之荒唐無稽之莠言，直等於囈語！</p>
<p>尤有痛心者，一般鄕民說，中醫說“食西藥後，將來食中藥無效，”以致一般愚民視西藥如服毒，不敢一試，夫中西藥品同出於動植礦之源，只有精粗之分，何至有如是怪事？亦許如是將來服中藥不靈時，他們可以嫁禍於新醫而糊塗卸責了！鄕人知識階級亦難免此，深中舊醫之毒，可知舊醫設法惑衆，顛倒是非，阻止新醫發達防佔其地盤，奪其飯碗，其用心可謂無微不至矣！這般舊醫宛如那般朦昧了良心的卦可以不卜，命不可以不算而飯不可不食的卜卦算命瞎子先生，有何二致？然這是社會的民生問題，應由國家補救解决，斷不能因要保留少數人之飯桶，而礙國家之進步，而害大多數人民之生命也。</p>
<p>國人須認清及辨別是非，我們不是像舊醫那樣卑鄙，為着奪舊醫的飯碗來反對舊醫，我們的立足點，是世界的科學，我們的工作，是要改正舊醫錯誤的理論。我們的目的，是促國家之進步，和謀民生之幸福，及保護人民生命之安全健康！</p>
<p>但是有一部分自私自利的奸商，以提倡之美名，來宣傳美名舊醫，而反對新醫，他們那裏曾睜開眼睛，看見高麗洋參等等，亦從外洋大輪船運進我國的國門？</p>
<p>最後，就是發展醫藥，要研究國產藥物，用科學方法精煉出來，以供治療之用，發展國粹，貢獻於世界，表場國家之光榮，這要請政府出力提倡科學，振興工業，開設工廠，聘請內外各門各類各科專家主持其事，自造醫藥用品及器具，以供國人之應，才是塞漏巵的根本救濟辦法！</p>

<h3>農村衛生事業推進的先决問題</h3>
<p>— 衣旦</p>
<p>在我們未談到農村衛生的諸問題之先，最好先得將公共衛生對於國家民族的復興關係認識一下，而後再談到農村的衛生行政措施上的地位何以重要以及今後從如何的途徑才可以得到順利的推進？</p>
<p>記得日本衛生教授常崗博士曾經說過：“民族的繁衍，強弱，恒視公共衛生之良窳為轉移。”的確，這話誰都知到，誰都會說，而且事實上又是必然的。據瑞典的有名統計家孫德堡氏說：“死亡率是尺量文明程度，和效能最好的方法：假如把兩國，或兩地方多年死亡率的記載比較一下，立刻就可以判斷他們文明發達的程度。”本來生命長短是隨衛生科學和預防醫學的進步而演長的，再攷察事實的佐證：據最近的調查，印度人的壽命，平均是廿五歲，美國馬薩諸省人，平均四十五歲；瑞典人平均是五十歲。至於這三國的衛生事業的發達與否？從他們壽命延長率上，以及擺佈在衛生事業的水準下的現實所顯出的高下差別，就可以默然而知了。並且由此可見生命之長短，恒受公共衛生人為力的支配。從另一方面講：公共衛生的目的，在於保全國民體格的健康，而為精神和物質發展的基礎。因為有了健全的民衆，才可組成健全的社會，有了健全的社會才有健全的國家；從來沒有民族孱弱社會病態而能建立雄偉的國家存在世界的！</p>
<p>據上述諸點，公共衛生的重要性已很坦白的顯示無餘了。故公共衛生之實施，在任何國家均占有事實迫切需要之重要的地位。但，公共衛生之進行之於我國，固為我國是以農立國的，而且農民人口占有全國總人口百分之八十五以上：而農民的不健康，因此也就是整個民族的不健康，民族的不健康，也就是國家存亡的關鍵，明白點說，就是國家，民族覆亡的先軀預兆，所以公共衛生雖則重要，而農村之公共衛生是尤加重要了。</p>
<p>可是目前的我國呢？整個的農村，可說是碳產了，農民的生活，無日不在被天災人禍蹂躪，現在都差不多踏上了死亡的末路，而農村的問題也就同時演成了一個極端嚴重的問題了。在這種情形之下，我們不時的可以聽到一句很摩登的口號—到農村去與復興農村。同時我們的政府，也巳有農村復興委員會的組織專司其事，並且對於衛生的改進和設施等方面，目光是巳投射到農村了。至其成績如何，自有其事實在，且非本文計論範圍。當然以上這是事實已經顯然的告訴我們，中國目前的農村衛生，是占着極大的重要性，也正就是說：亟於提倡農村衛生的，無異就是挽救目前奄奄一息底中國的生命。因為大衆深深知道農村衛生在中國是重要，是中國的一帖復興藥劑：於是負有推進農村衛生使命的，都在埋頭苦幹，也都在期望着能雊達到所謂意識的目的地—能夠隨着時代的潮流同時演進的農村—然而在這事業方興未艾的情况之下，我們要求得在推進農村衛生的過程中，沒有阻礙，和能實踐我們的希望，在個人從感覺上觀來，至少應將下列幾個問題解决：</p>
<p>㊀從事積極的宣傳</p>
<p>我們知道：我們所認為的必要實行的種種衛生方法，若欲施之於農民，並且還使他們樂於順從的實行：這件工作，的確不是一件容易的事！第一農民知識幼稚：第二迷信的影子深刻在腦際，有此兩種素因，因而農民對於衛生知識是絕對毫無容納的可能，那末旣無衛生之智識，當然對於衛生與新醫藥的良或窳不能明白的了解，當然有礙於衛生的地方也不知改進，所以疾病的交相侵擾，自然是意料中不可避免的事。但同時他們得自求生存，又不得不作另一面的企圖，於是仍然應着迷信的餘毒來做一些，鍊丹，吞符，求神，拜佛的自戕勾當。可是偶然的也會應着他們的要求—不這要求並不真夠是神靈的賜予，實際還是他們體中天然常備的抵抗力的暗佑，不過無從自覺罷了！—這就不能不說是一種無形中的精神上的心理治療了，當然他們信仰的理由，就是持着這一點的效果上，其實，也正就是造成他們失敗的因素，因為他們始終沒有改進的本能，僅持着迷信僥倖所獲得的一點賜惠，是决不足以保障生命的。然而人畢竟是富於理智的，而况他們唯一的目標，也還是在求同一的生存綫上哩！所以要使得我國今日的農民知曉衛生的真髓，至少要使得他們知道利害的所在，更知道江湖庸醫，迷信的傳統的觀念，等的殺人不用刀的切膚關係，這就不得不費一番口舌的搬動，來從事積極的衛生宣傳了</p>
<p>（二）必須與鄉紳合作</p>
<p>我們若是跑到人地生疏的徧僻農村去，説出來的話，能得到相應的情形，效果，是絶對不易見到的事。因爲在那麽樣的地方，所有的農民既不識我們，也就不能知道我們究是好人，抑是壞人，於是任憑我們怎樣將所應施與他們的衛生方法説得天花亂墜，或是呌破喉嚨，終於没有一個人來仁理睬你一下的，甚至他們還不免懷疑我們是在害他們的誘説的鬼胎，要避免這種流弊，唯一的方法，就是聯絡當地的紳士，和他們合作起來，携手同行，共謀推進，便可有顯著的收效了，因爲他們就如是那兒的領袖，大衆的農民都信仰他們，服從他們，凡是農材間所發生的大小事件，他們能够過問，他們能够左右大衆的農民，所以我們應採取這種方針，設法和當地士紳們合作，使他們能够順從我們，一旦實踐到這歩，就無異是大衆的農民順從我們一樣。這樣就可省却許多的麻煩，又可於簡單中獲着美滿的效果，同時我們的這種工作是應該和農民打成一片，那麽，實行和鄉紳合作，就是構成和農民打成一片的先進表現。（未完）</p>
<h3>眼耳鼻喉疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（一一九）何謂綠內障</p>
<p>我們眼球可以保持一定的緊張和硬度者。是由眼球壁的彈力及眼球內腔液體的壓力所致。這種情形在醫學上稱為眼壓。眼壓如果一旦發生病理的亢進。則病象立現。瞳孔亦卽稍呈綠色。眼球亦變堅硬如石。眼壓亢進若持續長久。則能引起眼內重要器官組織的萎縮而致失明。這種眼病，特稱之曰，綠內障。我國中醫眼科書中。亦早有記載。所謂雷頭風，徧頭風，五風變，綠風，黑風，青風，及烏風等等。概指綠內障而言。綠內障有原發性與續發性之列。原發性綠內障是指並無其他眼病而發。續發性綠內障是由虹彩炎或其他眼病而發。原發性綠內障更可分為二類。具有眼球發赤，及頭痛等等刺戟症狀者。稱曰炎性綠內障。並無刺戟症狀者。稱曰單性綠內障。</p>
<p>茲擬單就炎性綠內障略為一述。</p>
<p>炎性綠內障由其經過的急緩而有急性與慢性的分別。它的原因。尚屬不明。大都發生於四十歲以上的老年人。尤易發於神經質及精神過勞。它的經過。略可分為四期。卽</p>
<p>㊀前驅期——患者視力感覺模糊。夜間觀燈火時。周圍常現五色的虹輪。角膜表面發生漲蔓性混沌。瞳孔已稍散大。反應遲鈍。眼壓上昇。這等病狀經過數小時。卽可消失。而復常態。但是經過數日後。又復發作。如是數次反復發作後。卽入爆發期。</p>
<p>㊁爆發期綠內障——患者苦訴劇烈的頭痛。並感食慾不振，失眠，及惡心嘔吐等等。視力亦卽高度减退。角膜浮腫混沌。眼瞼亦浮腫，瞳孔散大。反應消失。眼壓甚高。以致眼球堅硬如石。可由眼瞼（眼皮）外面觖知。瞳孔呈綠色。所以本病特稱之曰，綠內障。有時本病症狀劇烈。不久卽能失明者。稱曰，電擊性綠內障。</p>
<p>㊂完全綠內障——眼內各種器官完全變性萎縮。患者此時多半陷於失明。角膜呈蔓瀰性混沌。虹彩萎縮變色。瞳孔散大。反應消失。眼壓特別增高。檢查眼底時。常可察見乳頭陷凹。</p>
<p>㊃變性綠內障——為綠內障的末期。角膜知覺脫失。發生大水泡性角膜炎或帶狀混沌。虹彩萎縮。眼痛頭痛。結果眼球亦來萎縮。眼壓亦卽低降。</p>
<p>綠內障的症狀。旣如此複雜。它的危險。又如此顯明。所以我們萬不可輕視此病。若然遇着視力障碍，瞳孔散大（除用散瞳藥），眼壓上昇，及頭痛的時候。卽宜立刻訪問專科醫師。是為上策。</p>
<p>（一二○）視神經炎</p>
<p>視神經炎的原因甚多。如㊀梅毒，㊁急性傳染病（感冒最多），㊂腎臟炎，㊃結核，㊄鉛中毒，㊅腦膜炎，及㊆外傷等等。均可發生。本症常與網膜炎併發。稱曰，視神經網膜炎。本症患者的自覺症候。就是視力减退及視野狹窄。若行眼底檢查。則見視神經乳頭發赤而隆起。它的境界。亦不顯明。網膜的靜脈。常形怒張。而動脈卽反細小。</p>
<p>視神經炎的預後。常事佳良。但有時亦可陷於視神經萎縮。它的治療方針。首宜探索原因病。而加治療。是為至要。</p>

<h3>第一特區地院昨宣判劉蘆隱解鄂訊辦</h3>
<p>鄂高院派員乘飛機來滬迎提　劉氏請求交保未邀法官允准</p>
<p>中央社云、前外交部次長唐有壬、與湖北省主席楊永秦兩暗殺案、經獲犯供出係劉蘆隱從中主使、旋於上月二十四日晨一時半、將劉氏捕獲、群情迭誌前報、該案於一日晨十時在第一特區法院刑事第一庭開審、湖北高等法院派員來滬向第一特區法院移提、當經馮世德推事宣判交鄂高法院來員移提歸案核辦、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>旁聽席上　宣告滿座</p>
<p>昨晨八時四十五分、劉氏由成都路捕房解送至第一特區法院、劉之夫人兄弟等均到庭、劉衣灰色綢衫、髮向後梳、微有花白、在特一刑一庭靜候開審、在未審至劉案之前、劉靜坐聆聽盜竊案、并不時與所請之律師談話、態度如常、旁聽席上、宣告人滿、</p>
<p>鄂高法院　要求移提</p>
<p>嗣至十時五十分、劉案開審、仍由馮世德推事庭訊、劉氏除原聘律師王壽安外、井加聘單毓華•何孝元•為辯護律師、市警察局派法律顧問詹紀鳳出庭、首由捕房律師汝葆彝宣稱、謂湖北高等法院將派代表來滬、預計十一時許可到、請求改於下午二時再行庭詢、嗣警察局法律顧問詹紀鳳謂、鈞院曁本局均接有鄂高等法院公文、一切手續、均已合法、應請立予審問、并將公文呈上、其時馮推事亦稱、本院已接到鄂高等法院首席檢察官陳師曾來電、同時聞市政府亦收到電報、當經劉氏本人及辯護律師要求一閱、來文略謂劉與暗殺楊永泰案有關、案情重大、要求移提歸案等語、劉之辯擭律師單毓華起立辯護、</p>
<p>劉氏陳述　請准交保</p>
<p>其時適湖北高等法院來員張福森、携帶公文、怱怱趕到、馮推事略事詢問、卽謂如法院以外之機關拘捕犯人、本院須調查證據、方准移提、現鄂高等法院行文移提、同隸司法機關、祇須人犯指認無誤、當然依法移提歸案、劉之律師請求交保、再行移提、詹紀鳳律師謂旣有公文、一切均屬合法、應請庭上准予立時移提、劉蘆隱旋向庭上陳述、謂本人被捕、應再詳加調查、否則精神物質名譽、均受損失、且本人絕不能輕易逃脫、請准予交保而後移提、</p>
<p>援筆宣判　移提歸案</p>
<p>嗣又由劉之代表律師加以聲述、最後劉謂如不予交保、本人聲明委託代表律師提出抗告、馮推事謂法院不能拒絕移提、抗告不能停止執行、卽援筆宣判劉蘆隱交湖北高等法院來員移提歸案核辦、准上海市警察局協助護送、卽宣告退庭、</p>
<p>押送警局　卽將解鄂</p>
<p>退庭後、劉氏偕家屬及辯護律師赴捕房律師休息室、並飲茶一杯、仍乘巡捕房轎車、赴成都路捕房、市警察局亦派員同往、由鄂高等法院來員辦理移提手續後、於午十二時許、卽將劉氏押往警察局、聞警察局對劉氏、甚為優待、並於當日下午會商决交鄂高等法院檢察處辦理、</p>
<p>要求移提　公文大意</p>
<p>鄂高等法院要求移提之公文大意、謂前鄂省主席楊永泰被殺案、經兇手成燮超•龔柏舟等供出、係劉蘆隱主使、劉氏曾組織“革命軍團”•“中華靑年特務隊”•等反動團體、在各地佈置黨羽、從事暗殺工作、故要求移提歸案審辦、</p>
<h3>糧運局發表粵米價跌</h3>
<p>因孔部長切籌救濟　每元可購十二市斤</p>

<h3>旅滬廣東四團體昨歡宴余漢謀等</h3>
<p>赴席者三百餘人　新亞酒店極熱鬧</p>
<p>廣東旅滬同鄕會廣肇公所、粵僑商業聯合會、潮州會館、四團體、昨（一）日下午六時、假北四川路新亞酒店大禮堂、舉行歡迎余漢謀曁粵籍各中委宴會、赴席者計有余漢謀•李煦寰•劉維熾•鄧剛•余俊賢•吳鐵城•唐海安•溫宗堯•蔡勁軍•李大超•等三百餘人、首由主席溫宗堯致歡迎詞、略謂、今日旅滬廣東同鄕會、廣肇公所、潮州會館、粵僑商業聯合會四團體、曁城滬同鄕、</p>
<p>共同歡迎</p>
<p>第四路軍總司令兼廣東綏靖主任、余幄奇先生、以及同鄕中委諸先生、承蒙諸位不棄、惠然肯來、同人等不勝榮幸、晋人旗居海上、大都久離鄕井、離鄕愈久、愛鄕之心愈切、余總司令以粵人而負吾粵最高領袖之責任、對於粵省軍政之設施、功在鄕井、昭昭在人耳目、諸位中委皆屬我國中堅、同鄕聞達、同為同人等所敬仰、此次因諸先生出席三中全會之便、</p>
<p>道過申江</p>
<p>同人等爰集合茲會、為懇切表示歡迎之意、一切怖置、形式雖不免簡陋、而用意實出於直擊純誠、一方面略盡地主之誼、一方面聯絡感情、一方面瞻仰諸位丰釆、一方面希望將粵中近狀、或黨政要聞、略以告慰同人、宗堯等代表同人、舉杯為余總司令、各位中委、各位先生、敬祝健康、請共醉一杯、繼由余總司令演講略謂今晚得與諸同鄕叙首一堂、把酒言歡非常欣幸、廣東數年來都處於</p>
<p>特殊情形</p>
<p>之下、外間不免隔閡、但自去年七月以後、此種情形、已掃除凈盡、關於粵省近狀、今晚趁此盛會、略向諸同鄕作一簡單報告第一政治方面、現在廣東巳實行軍民分治、地方治安亦日趨安靜、我們負責軍政的人、今後一本大公至正的精神、共抱不與民爭利的意旨努力向前邁進、第二建設方面、廣東的一切建設、現距離模範省的條件尚遠、一則因為人力財力的缺乏、二則因受世界不景的種種影響、以致工商業日趨凋敝、而農村亦漸呈蕭條之象、我們如欲把廣東造成模範省、實非有大量的</p>
<p>人力財力</p>
<p>的帮助不可、單就民食來說、過去廣東米糧的度量、或受政冶的影響、人民種植幾無利可圖省中荒田遍地、粵省米糧仰給外地的也一天一天地增加、而粵省的金融、就一天一天地向外滾流、現在關于糧食問題、難已得中央的帮助、但此係冶標的政策、治本之道、復仍須努力做到自供自給、才算澈底解决、其餘關於各種建設都在</p>
<p>計劃進行</p>
<p>中、希望諸同鄕為桑梓盡一分責任、為國家盡一分義務、對本省當局、時加指導與協助今晚借此一杯酒、謹祝諸同鄕健康、繼由吳市長演講略謂、去年七月間、兩廣問題緊張、全國人心、異富焦急、後得余幄奇先生主持正義、始能轉危為安、化險為夷、全國和平統一、及告完成、至於廣東目前急待解决的問題、第一為糧食問題、粵省糧食向靠安爾暹羅供給、每年</p>
<p>金融流出</p>
<p>數達七八千萬元、所以民食問題不能解决廣東一切問題、也無法解决、他此種問題、决非短促的時期、或少數人的力量可以做到、必須全省上下及中央致合作才能有濟、第二為金融問題、過去粵幣一元二角換大洋一元、現在因粵幣貶價、粵幣一元五角始換大洋一元、廣東為入超的省份、三千萬粵民的日常用品、每靠國外供應、因此物價抬高、人民生活亦日感困難、故幣價問題、亦為目前急待解决的問題、以上兩題、如能</p>
<p>得到解决</p>
<p>方可以建設新廣東、我們相信現任粵省當局必能努力為桑梓謀幸福、為國家謀福利、其餘關於旅滬粵人的公益事業、如學校醫院等、亦希本省當局、時加鼓勵與帮助、繼後演講者有劉廳長維熾等、直至八時餘、始盡歡而散、吳市長又定於今午十二時半、在國際飯店設宴、為余氏餞行、並介紹與滬上各界領袖會晤、余氏原定明日乘大來公司之麥金蘭總統號南返、茲以該輪中途遇霧、須至四日始能到滬、五日啟椗赴港故余氏之行程，亦將展緩矣</p>
<h3>南興輪中途風浪襲擊</h3>
<p>車翼打落油艙破毁　現往秀塗修理再航</p>
<p>法租界永安街二十六號南興輸船公司之南興號輪、專行駛上海至福建之興化泉州一路者、該輪以運裝貨件為主、今次從上海裝得大批雜貨、開往泉州、乃行至中途、該輸在海面上遭遇大風巨浪之襲擊、波濤汹湧、將船身衝打甚厲、發生極度危急之難航、船尾舵之發動機翼、竟為大浪打去、落沉海內、又該輸之裝容油艙、亦被大風猛浪打破、甚至甲板亦毁壞、幸竭力掙扎、得以脫此危境、然發動機翼打落、船已失去航行推進之能力、無法開駛、其油艙等處之損壞、亦急須修理、當卽勉强駛到秀塗地方停泊、一面急電寗波、命匯昌機器廠、趕速代造銅機翼兩片、運往應用、一面又用水泥等、將破損處填補、以便開赴泉州、其遇險情形、昨已電滬報告、至於詳細狀况、及損害程度等等、須俟該輪來滬、派騐船師檢騐、同時由船長補具遇險之詳報、方可明悉一切云、</p>
<h3>越界築路地段　房屋業主反對工部局收捐</h3>
<p>中央社云、關於越界築路地段之房捐問題、因公共租界工部局將强迫征牧、以致該地段內房屋業主紛起反對、但此事有關我國主權、爰經記者向關係各方探悉各情如下、</p>
<p>水電問題</p>
<p>收回越界築路一案、前經本市市政府與公共租界當局迭次交涉、但以種種關係、未能得一澈底解决辦法、本市市政府以事關主權、由市警察局在該地段內派立崗位、保護治安、維持秩序、關於該地段內之水電供給問題、亦已有相當之解决、在北四川路越界築路一帶、所有水電、大半已由閘北水電公司所供給、在滬西方面、電氣供給、由市政府核准另設立滬西電氣公司承辦、自來水問題、亦已由市政府謀取妥善解决辦法、</p>
<p>納稅情形</p>
<p>依照上述情形、所有該地段內之房捐、理應由本市市政府所征取、在北四川路一帶之房捐、已完全由市財政局派員征取、滬西一帶、市財政局亦派員征收、其中一部分業主、均已將房捐向市政府繳納、惟尚有一部分、則猶未繳納、</p>
<p>業主反對</p>
<p>此次公共租界擬向越界築路地段業主征取房捐、現經一般業主起而反對、本市政府自當力爭、同時希望在越界築路地段業主均能遵照中國法令、自行向稽征處繳納房捐、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗市獨跌本月</p>
<p>倉庫存紗豐厚多頭開始掉期</p>
<p>近遠差價愈近大都看小抛賣</p>
<p>紗市遠期趨勢轉挺、本月份獨見下跌、蓋以目前倉庫存紗雄厚、多方受其壓廹、有一部份開始掉期、賣出本月購進遠月、因此近遠月差價愈接愈近、大有近低遠高之陣勢矣、市塲上情形、有同業由空翻多者、亦有老多頭斬結者、而尤以抛賣看小者佔多數、午後傳言國防公債發行説、買氣稍盛而趨高翔矣、賡豐大量買進、長豐則大量賣出云、</p>
<p>六月期紗昨日上塲</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月又呈回漲之象、因金子帮又來買進遠期、市態益緊、但二盤開拍、三品紗市平庸、賣風驟起、檯面殊見鬆弛、多説倉庫存紗雄厚、一時不易售罄、於是氣勢甚挫、三品紗收盤復跌、遠月亦破二百四十元關口、但遠期多頭拉緊仍不放棄、標紗結果本月比上日收盤價跌一元半至六角、遠漲二角、六月期昨已上塲、價爲二百三十六元半、比五月期上塲價低十元○四角、午後開盤本月仍疲乏無勁、但遠期多方掉進而緊、二盤後聞現紗交易尚有一千六百包、三品紗稍形回上、遠月緩歩上升、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲二·六·九角至一元一角、查賣出大豐一千五百五十包、泰興一千包、森康一千一百包、仁豐九百五十包、大昌成一千七百包、長豐六千五百包、潤康四千五百包、同和二千六百五十包、買進賡豐一萬一千二百包、恒益一千九百包、達記八百五十包、裕大八百五十包、明德九百五十包、昶記一千四百五十包、瑞大一千四百五十包、泰昌二千二百包、大昶一千四百包、信誠一千六百包、大慶一千三百包、兹將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>紗銷一千六百餘包</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚稱不惡、查全日各帮買去統計一千六百六十五包、售價跌一元、綫跌三元、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>標花得紗市之助力</p>
<p>六月期上塲開四十四元</p>
<p>現棉消費呆滯來源未見</p>
<p>棉市回高、市態堅固、良以海外棉市、轉向上漲、加之各路存棉雖厚、近日抵滬未旺、故獲利空頭、稍有抵補、但同業傾向賣出、午後因流言利於多方、市價隨紗市向升、但現棉交易頗滯云、標花前市開盤、各月一律上漲、且形勢緊俏、蓋以美棉印棉一致轉趨高翔、人心帶好一歩、但同業仍傾向抛賣、但入後又復回挫、六月期昨日上塲、價爲四十四元、比五月期上塲價僅跌三角半、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一角半至二角、午後開盤、市情仍堅昂、檯面乾枯、抛賣者未旺、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一角、查賣出長和八千二百擔、恒德一千四百擔、大昌成四千五百擔、益康一千擔、源興一千三百擔、新華昌一千九百擔、永大一千三百擔、大昶二千擔、恊成一千四百擔、愼記二千二百擔、申大二千八百擔、裕大二千三百擔、買進振大八千九百擔、仁豐五千八百擔、泰昌七千二百擔、昶記一千二百擔、森康二千二百擔、益昶一千九百擔、新華四千擔、一日間行市比較如後、</p>
<p>現棉消費停滯、廠胃呆木、來源未見、</p>
<p>日本上週未進印棉</p>
<p>孟買上週市况、因廠家大批限價買進、微見回高、惟與美棉相比、依然疲軟、日本買户、絶跡市塲、蘭開夏見印棉較廉、大事吸收、大陸及印度紗廠買進不多、蓋彼等深信在日本未能購買以前、遲遲購進、較爲合算也、附錄上週統計如左、（單位千包）</p>
<p>日紗續跌棉價上漲</p>
<p>一日大阪電、現紗跌一至十元、十六支扇面二百二十五元、跌三元、二十支金魚二百四十五元、跌一元、四十支五星三百七十五元、跌五元、四十二支雉子三百六十元、跌十元、三品期紗、除近月與遠月不動、餘月均小五角至一元五角、近月收盤爲二百三十七元、遠月爲二百三十九元六角、又棉花除遠月不動、餘月均漲二角五分至三角五分、近月收盤爲七十四元八角五分、遠月爲七十六元二角五分、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>深色布銷路尚可觀</p>
<p>昨棉布市面、以紗市歩落、人心虚軟、更以天時陰寒、淺色布疋如府綢色丁花布漂布等貨雖有小額裝辦、尚乏大批現裝交易、因之藍布·直貢·綫呢·及深地印花·布疋走勢尚有可觀、以藍布爲尤盛、惟受時令限制、銷路短促、銷貨究屬有限、惟軍裝十六磅及十四磅粗布·粗斜因軍衣帮進胃仍濃、華商永安·申新·恒豐等廠儘力趕織、仍有不敷應需之勢、現貨及近期貨額頗感困難、市勢頗堅、英商怡和廠粗布十一磅至十六磅走勢均佳、九磅粗布因受華商寳興內衣申新等廠貶價影響、走勢稍呆、惟出品不多、價仍不鬆、東貨細布·細斜形勢略軟、以月底剛過、雙方進出均意存觀望、成交大淡云、</p>
<p>火姆四本頗爲流行</p>
<p>火姆四本今春頗見盛行、本外埠西服裁縫帮進胃極濃、逐日零躉交易非常暢達、新花色到來較上年爲夥、西服套頭及春大衣、獵裝燈籠褲等、現多盛行、致銷用日廣、昨瑞文火姆四本、每碼批售五元四角、友誼六元二角半、羅福五元九角、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>春寒尚厲期粉買氣突盛</p>
<p>昨日粉市、各月份呈　致回漲之象、以洋麥報價、兩日來計回漲三四角左右、故開價時、以國外報漲、又兼春寒陰雨、致各月份買氣、突然暢盛、本月份以廠方抵補、故一度高至四元零三分半、四月份則業外吸進、亦提至四元零二分七釐半、七月份則大户套進、開價至三元五角、八月份係初次開拍、開價三元五角、旋即回軟、一盤以後、則各方散多暢脱、各月份均歩歩回跌、較初開最高價、跌　三四分不等、迨至下午開盤、因市塲人心不佳、三四月份又一度跌進四元大關、後則廠方仍補、又復回振二三分、七八月份新粉、人心見平、上落無幾、此後情形、須以實銷爲轉移云、</p>
<p>六七月新麥賣出較旺</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、四洋麥報價、回漲三四角左右、並以入春多雨、人心未免轉硬、故開價後、三四月份、較好三五分、遠期初亦穩定、後則盤旋、迨至下午開盤、本月份因前月份之貨、爲津帮收去、人心甚穩、四月份則客户互有進出、暫趨平静、六七八月份新麥、則以新粉價軟、賣户較暢、較上午回小三五分、現麥市面、因到銷兩寂、價呈穩固、開烏衣麥六元六角、淮安麥六元五角六分、江北麥六元五角四分、合肥麥六元二角半、由福新辦二千五百包、申大辦五百包云、</p>
<p>食米本街銷塲尚可</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到三十餘號、貨約六千三四百石、內薄稻有十餘號、天時陰雨、人心復定、故本銷雖屬平常、包胃亦祗西安青島帮辦薄稻七八百包、市况呈穩定之局、厚薄粳行情悉無榮辱、杜洋尖及陰元均相仿、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源不多、約十七八號市上各貨、因天時陰雨、胃納尚可、客性堅挺、致白粳高料勉立、中次加緊近角、早稻跟緊之勢、薄稻包胃不化、本城略有交易、價形挺秀、杜尖價見緊勢、羊埠客尖定局、陰變元挺立、其餘各貨價形平定、惟收盤各貨去路、似轉呆滯、</p>

<h3>美國景氣與生絲消費之檢討（三）</h3>
<p>— 天予</p>
<p>這裏很明顯的是生絲的消費領域，已更深進一層的被别種服用纖維所攫奪；而生絲有被威脅而退却的可能，不用説，這是人造絲領土拓展的結果。可是生絲具有高尚的品質，如光澤强力等等，實爲人造絲所萬不能比擬的特點；又適逢着最大主顧之美國的景氣恢復；更如生絲的獨佔領土女子平編襪分量的一成二分之加重等等的好機會，在理固宜有特異的發展。何故消費不特不能與景氣比例的增加，反大大的减退呢？這點，是一般直覺的人所不易明瞭的。但我們如果仔細的加以分析時，就會覺得這種現象，亦不是偶然的。</p>
<p>原來：景氣的上昇，必定連帶的物件高漲；生絲的價格，承前年下半期的昂貴趨勢，而直維持其相當的高價，觀乎下表，即可瞭然；</p>

<h3>章太炎反對白話詩的理由</h3>
<p>— 嚴飛鵾</p>
<p>自從陳獨秀胡適之這批人，提倡了新詩推翻舊詩，一時繼起者，大有「風起雲湧」之概，尤其是青年們；但是反對者，也因此紛紛而起了；雙方堅守着新舊壁壘，鏖戰了好多年，到現在依然新舊「分道揚鑣」没有真的結果。</p>
<p>章太炎先生也是堅守舊壁壘，反對新詩的一份子，不知道底藴的人，以爲先生「見仁見智，」其實錯了；原來先生反對新詩的理由，站在「詩」的立塲講，真是「名正言順。」如：先生「答黄家澍書」就有論到新詩的地方，他説：「……白話詩原不始今人，元白已往往有之；鄙人所反對者，在其無韻，不在其用白話，故以史思明「櫻桃詩」爲誚。大抵詩必永言，節奏既長而無韻以諧之，則聽之必不入耳，是古人無無韻之詩也。且詩果無韻，詠史即與史論不異；汎詠山川風景，叙述行路艱難，即與遊記不異；何必名之爲詩也？……」</p>
<p>這一段話，把新詩的缺點，一語道破，我們應該點首悦服的；就是提倡的人們，我想也許没有充份的理由，再來文過了。</p>
<h3>髮髻</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>民國以來，婦女頭上的髮髻，可説得是已極盡變化之能事。</p>
<p>淸代式的髮髻，隨着革命高潮，而被淘汰。在那時，男子盛行剪髮，於是婦女們，摹仿古式，而把垂諸腦後的髮髻，移上當頭，形如牛糞，美其名曰盤香髻，但也有直呼之爲牛糞髻的。依因三百年的習慣關係，把髮髻梳在當頭，總覺有些兒不慣，於是過了不多時，仍復退居於腦後。接着，由腦後的盤香髻，一變而爲駁心髻，一名風凉髻。駁心髻的最初期，是緊貼在腦後的。嗣後逐漸地下垂，而達於肩下。以愈下垂者，爲愈時髦。可是到了後來，每一件衣服上，都給染上了一大塊油痕，於是緊貼在腦後的扇子髻，便應運而生了。下鋭上寛，形如張開的摺扇。然而挽梳扇子髻，手續繁複，非一小時不可，乃復演變而爲豎愛斯髻，更進而爲横愛斯髻。迨國軍北伐，底定武漢，光復淞滬之後，婦女髮髻，都相率被付於并州之一剪。於是乎這個演變不已的髮髻問題，遂獲得了一個根本的解决。雖然近來還偶有一二摩登婦女，把剪餘秀髮，挽成菱形髻，以炫異者，然亦不過是極少數。髮髻的命運，大致已走上了最後的一歩。再過二十年。髮髻這東西，或許是將歸於自然淘汰了。</p>
<p>查髮髻一物，在昔日，是被視爲婦女勤惰之標識的。髮光可鑒者，其人必勤，反之，必惰。所以婦人未剪髮髻之時，每日晨興，第一件工作，便是梳髻，挺够麻煩。可是現在髮髻是没有了，所餘的頭髮，却又成爲該婦女的摩登與否的標準了。燙得入時的，才爲人重視，反之，便被目爲是鄉下婦人。可知古人説起頭髮，總説是三千煩惱絲，良有以也。還有一層，婦女梳攏髮髻時，總是喜歡插上滿頭的珠翠，所耗不貲。剪髮之後，半月一水燙，一月一電燙，其代價，也殊可觀。所以婦女的剪除髮髻，在實際上，並不是一種進歩，不過是一個變相的髮髻而已。古人有水晶簾下看梳頭之語，大家都目爲是韻事風流。初行剪髮時，一般，都認爲髮髻無存，大殺風景。然而髮髻既去，娘兒們，依然是每天少不了的對鏡梳攏。而同時，在手提袋中，更都携帶着小梳一具。雖在電車之中，也儘有對鏡理鬢的。去了髮髻，比了未去時，更富風韻，這或許也不是一般人意料所及的吧。</p>
<h3>嚼檳榔</h3>
<p>— 奚堪</p>
<p>長沙城裏的人，往往在用完酒席以後，每客分送一小包桂子檳榔。據説湘南方面，檳榔成爲一種日常不可少的嗜好，想是接近五嶺，辟瘴辟濕的關係。我有許多朋友是湘潭人，他們都是喜歡嚼檳榔的。我只能够嚼桂子檳榔，湘潭人嚼的重灰檳榔，至我却吃不消。那種檳榔味道苦澀，蘸上去的石灰質，不知道是天然石灰呢？還是礪壳石灰，真不好吃！</p>
<p>南方人嚼檳榔，這一習慣，由來已久，南史裏就有過關於檳榔的記載，可惜現在我不能憑着記憶力舉出原文。宋人周去非的嶺外代答卷八裏説：檳榔生海南黎峒，亦産交趾，木如椶桐，結子葉間，如柳條顆顆叢綴其上。春取之爲軟檳榔，極可口。夏秋採而乾之爲米檳榔，漬之以鹽爲鹽檳榔，小而尖者爲鷄心檳榔，大而扁者爲大腹子，悉下氣藥也。海商販之，瓊官收其征歳計居什之五。廣州税務收檳榔税，歳數萬緡。於是，則諸處所收，不可勝計矣。</p>
<p>我們根據這段記載，可以知道宋代廣州税收，檳榔税也是一大宗，那時嚼檳榔的風氣可以想見。同時在這段記載裏，我知道檳榔的産地，形狀，種類，功用。嚼檳榔，據我的經騐，在飯後，嚼了又嚼，生出許多津液，不待説是有助於消化的。而且酒醉飯飽，吃膩了油葷，嚼一口檳榔，便覺淸爽舒服。至於它的害處怎樣，那就不得而知。舊醫書裏説是降氣耗氣，似乎玄妙不可捉摸。希望醫藥家有閒功夫把檳榔化騐一下，分析它的成份，才能確定它的效能。</p>

<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回（絮語感慈幃懺情殉孝秋光黯翠黛觸景書懷）</p>
<p>夢蘭帶了一點笑容也點點頭道：二嫂句句話都説得是實話。大概二哥在背後也説了我許多不是吧？二少奶奶連連摇着手道：你二哥决没有和我提過一個字。夢蘭笑道：嫂子倒不要誤會。我所問的，並不是説作哥哥的在我身後，議論我什麽短處。不過也像二嫂所説的話，我現在新不新舊不舊的，却不成個生活。二少奶因爲坐得久了，衣服有了皺紋，就站起來牽扯了兩下衣服。低頭向着懷裏，却撩起眼皮，對夢蘭臉上看着。微笑道：倒是母親有時提到你，説是妹妹一年大一年了，説話就快畢業了，畢業之後，又怎麽樣呢？夢蘭笑道：畢業之後怎麽樣我也不能做官呀。二少奶道：倒並不是爲此。母親的意思，以爲女孩子長到一百歳，總也是人家的人。可是妹妹的意思，老人家一點也摸不着。所以爲了這些，他老人家的病，大概是不容易好乾净的。越過越久，人家是越逼越緊，不定把老人家逼出一塲什麽病來。他説到這裏，就把眉毛皺起來了。夢蘭道：誰越逼越緊呢？二少奶本是在臉上堆滿了愁容的，聽了他這話，倒是微微的一笑起來了。夢蘭在碟子裏抓起一片松子糖，却又放下，對於嫂嫂臉上這番笑意，是如何來的，大概很是明白。於是把糖放下，突然站起來道：母親有什麽爲難之處，只管告訴我，我縱然不孝，也决不能叫老人家爲了我送掉老命。二少奶道：也不室於到那種程度。彷彿……説到這裏，把頭偏着作個沉思的樣子。接着道：聽到説，劉府上最近又送子日子來了。就在九十月之間。並且附帶着説明了，若是爲了妹妹讀書的事，不能准這個日子，那是小事。喜事以後，可以照樣聽使妹妹上學。母親是没説什麽，大概父親是作主答應了。母親幾次三番，想把話告訴你，總怕你不高興。本來嗎，那個作女孩子的人，捨得離開娘呢？母親只管爲難，所以身體老不大好。夢蘭越接着向下聽，臉色是越顯着蒼白，坐着垂下頭來，將手弄了衣角，很久説不出話來。二少奶也是偷眼看個不了。並不在這時候插嘴説話。（一三九）</p>
<p>短篇小説</p>
<h3>濤聲烟雨</h3>
<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>連朝的寒雨，像把我這顆心投入了一個陰鬱的海裏，我的心已給那陰鬱的味兒浸透了。於是，我開始對這苦澀的鄉村生活，也感覺起憎厭來。</p>
<p>我悽凉地回到了自己的鄉土，匆匆已一星期多了；可是那三天四天的雨，真使我感到比坐監牢還要難受。尤其是到了晚上，我常常獨坐着，對着那盞慘淡的燈火，聽着窗外淅澀的雨聲出神；那無涯的寂寞只像毒蛇一樣地嚙着我的心，我痛苦着。</p>
<p>終於，在一個細雨霏霏的早晨，我就那樣毅然地離别了家人，帶着這簡單的行篋，踏上了那遥遠的征途。汽笛已經是第二次的長鳴了，於是許多乘客都蠭　着向輪船上走去，一陣的騷動，使船身也給震撼得摇盪不定起來。我們下了艙，輪船也轉過了頭，向着波光浪影中駛去，而送行者與離别者的視綫，也漸漸地在那一片「珍重」聲裏消失了。</p>
<p>艙裏没有幾個人，我是佔據了一個角落坐着，眼睛望着窗外，一種惆悵和一種寂寞却緊緊地追着我。</p>
<p>風發狂似地捲着，船身在浪裏顛簸，我們全像孩子睡在摇籃裏一樣，一刻兒滾到這邊，又一刻兒跌到了那邊，桌上的茶壺茶盃也都給翻到了底下。許多人駭怕着，孩子在哭嚷，娘兒們都靠着船舷嘔吐了。我茫然地望着湖面上，那湖面上給一片白迷迷的烟雨籠罩着，好像散着一層濃重的濕霧，彷彿小山頭那麽高的浪濤，却一個一個的，滾滾地直對着船舷上坍下來，船身便跟着浪頭的起伏而鼓盪；浪花飛上了船面，玻璃窗也給敲得碰碰地作響。那雨點子打在浪面上，顯出了蜂窠似的窟窿，但立刻又隨着浪濤俱失了。</p>
<p>洪亮的濤聲，淸脆的雨響，在那遼闊的太湖面上鬧着，像是一片山坍的聲音。</p>
<p>船，似乎是一隻倔强的牲口，它儘䭾數十條性命，勇敢地，鼓着浪，迎着風雨，向那悠悠的烟波裏前進。那糢糊的孤島，隱約的山影，却從船傍邊移了過去。</p>
<p>在輪船將行近胥口的時候，那朦朧的湖面上，在離開船十多丈的地方，突然出現了一片黑點的影子，那好像在水面上浮着許多什麽東西，也像天空擠着的星星，排得非常齊整，由遠遠地望過去，真是十分好看。</p>
<p>「那是什麽呵，是水鶘鸕呵！」一個摩登女郎那樣高興地叫了起來，伊已忘記了剛才暈船的痛苦。接着，傍邊那個西裝少年似乎是改正伊的錯誤般説：</p>
<p>「不，這是鳬，鳬就是野鴨。」一隻白蓬的帆船，漸漸地從那邊山檔裏飄過來了，而且非常迅速，不一刻工夫，便行近了一片黑點的中間，於是，只聽得一陣響聲，無數黑點全飛到了空中，刹時，那天空中便祗見一片黑色的影子在活動着了。</p>
<p>輪船在那濤聲烟雨裏航行，艙裏的人却像疲憊似地鎭静了下來。等到將近進口的時候，風便小了，浪也平静了，然而那無休止的苦雨，却還滴答滴答地在船面上響着。</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>旱橋</h3>
<p>— 許下幃</p>
<p>「旱橋！」它静静地横跨在鐵路的上面，握着北火車站西着貫通鐵路一邊的交通要鈕；他的式樣。雖很樸實，還含着中國固有的東方美術化，木的欄杆，木的柱架，一切都以木料做成，然而，它有它的特點，它有它的長處，反之，一切設備，原都求於實用，並不是祗顧欣賞的一種擺設。雖然，南火車站也有一座高高的旱橋，説不定他省他市，都有它的同類，可是一切都名因功著，北站旱橋的功績，確實有勝過他處的可能，因此，咱們住在上海的人們，一提起旱橋，腦袋裏都會浮上新民路虬江路之間的它吧！</p>
<p>裝滿了乘客和貨物的二十世紀的怪物，在它的肚子下不斷的往來，更不知有多少人們每日在它的背上經過，它没動怒，它没撒嬌，它不怕强暴的侵廹，也不怕風霜的欺凌，它很忠誠的替社會人類服務，長長的數十年渾如一日，它確是一個鎭静苦幹，不尚口號的實犯者，它的功績，真偉大啊！要是一天没有了它，附近的交通定會發生紊亂，往來的人們更要叫苦便天，但是，現在很少人能注意到它，甚至反有厭惡它的，真的，我委實非常地替它叫屈。</p>
<p>它曾經目擊一二八之役，爲爭民族生存的血戰，更目擊某國軍窮兵黷武的野蠻行爲，血戰到第三十四天，我們的軍隊終因戰略關係而後退了！它！——旱橋——也於突然間失了保護，然而它似乎抱定與國土共存亡的主義，始終屹立不動，不畏縮，不逃遁，敵人猛烈的砲火，和巨大的炸彈，不能損毁它的毫未，結果滬戰告停，它依然替社會很忠誠的服務，翁照垣將軍説：「子彈見了勇敢的將士，會自動避開。」誠然，它便是戰勝的一個。</p>
<p>「頭可斷，血可流，國不可亡。」</p>
<p>滬戰去今已足足的五年了！被黷武者毁壞的一切建設物，現在也漸漸恢復原狀，在政府努力復興之下，已找不出當年二軍血戰的跡痕，祗有旱橋南堍的水門汀圍牆上，還留着上面那樣隱約可辨，陸軍獨立一五六旅用石灰水寫成的慷慨激昂的字迹。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>禁止跳舞吸烟和以身作則</h3>
<p>— 蕭梅</p>
<p>本市社局召集的全市中等學校訓育主任聯席會議，前天在靑年會舉行，除了討論禁止中學生跳舞吸香烟等議案外，社會局的潘局長還親自出席報告開會意義，並指示訓育方針。可見當局對靑年學子的前途是怎樣的關心着。</p>
<p>潘局長在報告中说：“……訓育除照規定的方案去實施以外，最有效的方法，無過於先生與學生之能共同生活，所謂‘以言教不如以身教’，‘以身教則從，以言教則訟’，可知以身作則，是訓育的最好方法：學者效也，學生本是倣效別人的，但倣效必須有榜樣，教師就是學生的榜樣，故訓育主任應幫助校長，並使全體教職員共明此意，大家以身作則為學生的好榜樣，則學生無論學誰，都可日進無疆而成為健全的國民了。……”</p>
<p>如何使靑年學子養成為“健全的國民”？我們丟開其他的條件不談，以身作則無論如何總是一個切要的條件。或者說，因為“為人師表”的認識錯誤，他的世界觀和入生觀與時代精神不合，因而將會把純潔的學生引導到死路上去吧，然而那已經是另一問題了；我相信，學生的自身是也會有取捨的標的的，中學生已經不是幼稚園的小孩子了，一加二等於三他們固然不會相信，就卽使相信了，他們也會把這答案和“國家現代的事實”去對證一下，看是不是是三的。</p>
<p>所以，我以為，“為人師表”的資格夠不夠是另外一個問題。而要學生相信先生，成為“敎師就是學生的榜樣”者，以身作則無論如何是一個切要的條件。譬如這次聯席會議上有一個議案是說“如何禁止中學生跳舞吸香烟”的，我就希望以後不要有中學校長，訓育主任，甚至是敎職員在舞場發現，卽使在發現的時候，加以聲明說是來調查學生是否有違禁的，結果也不會使人相信。又如吸香烟，以後在課堂上或敎員休息室裏不會吸是必然的，但也希望旁的地方也不要吸，甚至是在公館裏或以為其他人們不會發覺的地方。因為不成其為議決案，不想以身作則到還可以，議决了，“為人師表”的又該是以身作則的，則設或不幸為人發覺，除了違禁之外，是還有敎學生陽奉陰違，私自作弊的流弊的。</p>
<p>但是，“為人師表”的先生們是否能做到呢？我不敢說不能，但也不敢寫下保單，說全能。例如不久之前，我們在報上就看到過校長先生因開長房間和旅館打官司的新聞過，“開長房間”固然並不在吸烟跳舞之列，但現代敎育說是敎學生們去開長房間，想起來總還不至於吧。</p>
<p>以身作則，在敎學上是切要的：以身作則的和時代精神相背與否，我們願意和“國家現代的事實”相對證一下：現在，我們就來“聽其言而觀其行”的以觀其後吧。</p>
<h3>懷鄉病者</h3>
<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>冷靜像一層薄紗輕輕地罩蓋了整個學校，學校像一座古剎，像－座老大無人的建築，處處觸得着荒凉的氣息了。</p>
<p>平日顧嫌其囂吵人的宿舍，大部分房子空了。走廊上那盞油燈和自己案頭的洋燭閃出的淡光，使人想起古剎的佛堂寶殿！胡絃斷音了，梵亞鈴啞了吧？</p>
<p>……被憂鬱打倒了！自己雖然流浪了五六個年頭，踏過了無數山河，可是，什麼人忘得掉家呢？天黑的時候，鳥兒也會回巢的；日落的時侯，牛兒也會回棚的——什麼人忘得掉家呢？</p>
<p>餘留下來的幾十個人中，劉是我僅僅認得的一個。前些日子大家雖然沒有什麼深的交情，近幾天來却彼此都有了深長的友誼。他本來住在我對面房子。為了寂寞，前天他搬過來了。</p>
<p>劉是個高個子，于思于思長滿了臉頰，頭髮亂而且長，像經年沒剃過。他喜歡喝酒剝花生米，酒量不見得大，喝醉了滔滔地講個不歇。他是黑龍江人。同我一樣已有五個年頭沒有團聚在家裏了。醉的時候他常常對我說：</p>
<p>“別像女孩兒樣了吧！誰沒有家呢——別想牠就得啦！講起來：你的家在南洋，不過是遠了點而已；在我，想要回去怕就難啦。來吧，乾一杯，古人說得好：酒能消愁。腦子裹一亂，家——什麼也不想了。……”</p>
<p>我不會喝酒，酒的苦味使我怕，而且，時時刻刻我總記得母親怎樣關照我的；每一次劉的邀請因此總受了我的拒絕。……然而，到底我忍不住了。每天每天，我看見醒着的苦悶着的劉一杯一杯把酒倒進肚裏去，然後漲紅着臉興奮地口沫四射地高談或高唱起來，等到疲倦了或者是舌頭僵硬了，便下去，發起鼾來。好像酒眞的替他消了愁。……我羨慕起來了。……有一天，當着劉醉得正酣的時候，我一氣嚥下了四杯五加皮。……漸漸地，我覺得兩耳兩頰都炙熱起來了，頭有點暈亂，然而却並不想說話，思潮儘管起起伏伏攪個不停，嘴似乎越黏越緊了。我躺下去覺着異樣不舒服。彷彿床和房子都在動蕩着，彷彿有什麼人在我胸口使勁壓得我喘不過氣來，我彷彿受了委曲般想慟哭起來了。我想靜，然而我不能控制自己了。血彷佛想闖出來般在周身沸騰起來。……我覺着異常煩擾，忽然想到外面什麼地方凉凉去，披了大衣，我冲出宿舍走到田野裏去了。</p>
<p>田野在灰色的凝重的天空下顯得異常荒凉。我無目的地在田野的濕潤的土地上到處亂走……直到我開始覺得冷，寒冷的北風已把我的兩耳和鼻子吹凍得鮮紅，僵硬；腳也似乎有點痛，又有點硬了。……回來的時候，我已清醒了許多，路途也就特別吃力起來了。……</p>
<p>回到宿舍，劈頭就聽得劉在提起嗓子唱薛禮嘆月。</p>
<p>“他又醉了？”</p>
<p>我想。又有點茫然起來。……</p>
<h3>在簡易小學裏</h3>
<p>— 黃敬</p>
<p>又失敗了！消耗了整暑假的時光獃在天津找職業。却一無所得！走上窮途末路了，怎麼辦？一切都會成為夢想的！不過我終久得活下去，鼓起最大的勇氣活着！於是我帶着顆重傷的心，又跑回北平，把最後的希望放在那裏。這哪兒成呢？北平這個在風雨飄搖中的古城，已非往昔了！牠的喉管已被強獸的爪牙擒住！不許牠自由呼吸！我才離開牠兩年的工夫，已變得這般可怕！無數的無辜的人們張着口餓，到處尋覓飯碗！一切都明白的暗示給我，尋找職業是沒有希望的！那麼絕望了，朋友們誰也沒能力顧及到我，在此情况之下，我想卽刻離開此地，不料，一個朋友竟然給我找到了“簡易小學”敎員的位置。每月可拿“十三元薪水”。雖然“十三元”這可怕又可憐的數目也名之曰“薪水”，我總得接受這隻飯碗！</p>
<p>以前我不知道北平這“文化古城”有所謂“簡易小學”。“平民學校”是有過的，不過數目極少。現在這“簡易小學”却是每區都有，大概公家也實行普及敎育政策吧，所以也施恩惠到窮人的孩子身上。這種小學是“自治區公所”設辦的！在名義上是“窮人的子弟沒有錢也可以讀書”，賓際上敎育經費還是出在窮人自己身上，辦敎育的還在這上面揩油水，外表上是“完全為平民謀福利”。</p>
<p>全市的簡易小學都是以校址街名而取名稱，我們這學校在宣武門外“粉房琉璃街”，所以學校便呌“粉房琉璃街簡易小學”。學校的所在地是一處廣東會館，大門口雖有“廉欽會館”的金字大匾，但這裏邊却只住了兩個廣東人。其餘的人很雜，有說大鼓書的有小販，有開洋車廠的，這裏完全是個大雜院。</p>
<p>兩個敎室都陰暗而且污穢！牆上的年久的壁灰，巳經剝落了！磚角露在外面。窗子的木櫺給風雨損壞得不堪，也沒法往上面糊紙，縱使寒冷的秋風放肆，也祇得忍受着。學生們他們會悄悄的挨着，他們受慣了苦痛，苦痛早把他們征服了！</p>
<p>假如你走進這敎室，要是不當心的話，準會嚇你一跳。地上那些渦坑使你跌足！更可憐的是桌子和凳，幾乎不是少腿就是三只脚，沒有一條凳子不用磚頭墊着，有時正在講書，忽然學生從凳子跌倒，弄得哄堂大笑。為了這些桌凳，學生不斷的打架，向先生告狀，挨打完事。然辦敎育的人並沒來注意這些敎育上的設備。他們總覺得窮人的孩子能給他們書讀已經是了不得，要找舒服那裏可以呢？</p>
<p>在學校裏最活躍的人物，不是“校長”，而是聽差兼傳達的老白。他是一隻眼，據他自己說，以前當過大兵，受了傷現在不幹了。沒一個學生不受他管束，他說一就是一，說二就是二，那些可憐的孩子是不知道反抗他的。每天他從外面買了些吃食到學校來販賣，價鈿就變了雙倍。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>校長從來不按時上課，有時我下了一課他才到學校來，不過要是自治區公所要派人來視察時，他却一淸早就到學校，吩咐聽差的打掃這打掃那，並且嚇學生：“查學的來時誰要吵閙講話就開除！”</p>
<p>一個月過去了！我的“薪水”没發下來。直到第二個月十號才領到。後來老白背地告訴我説，校長慣於扣壓教員的薪水，其實公所裏月底把薪水送來了。</p>

<h3>Wu Ke-ren and Others Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday to Separately Visit Chiang and He</h3>
<p>He Yingqin Also Held a Banquet to Welcome Them. The Second Group of Generals Will Also Come South. Wu Expressed His Willingness to Strive Forward Under Chiang's Leadership. Chen Duan in Nanjing Requested the Ministry of Finance to Subsidize Gansu Province's Finances.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Ke-ren, Army Commander of Zhang Xueliang's troops, Li Zhentang, Tang Junyao, Huo Shouxi, Ying Fucheng, and others, after visiting Zhang Xueliang in Fenghua, arrived in Shanghai on the 28th and reached Nanjing on the 1st, staying at the Capital Hotel. They immediately visited Chairman Chiang to receive instructions and separately visited He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, and Wang Shuchang, Director of the Gansu-Sui Pacification Headquarters, to report on everything. They plan to return to Shaanxi by Eurasian aircraft on the morning of the 2nd. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Ke-ren, Army Commander of the 67th Army, and Li Zhentang, Huo Shouyi, Zhou Fucheng, Tang Junyao, Zhang Zhiheng, and others, a group of six people, arrived in Nanjing by train from Zhejiang via Shanghai on the morning of the 1st after paying their respects to Zhang Xueliang in Xikou. They went to their lodgings to rest. Northeastern fellow countrymen Wang Shuchang, Zou Zuohua, Wu Hanqing, Wei Datong, and others visited Wu and others to chat. At 4 p.m., Wu and others went to the Central Military Academy to pay respects to Chairman Chiang and listen to his instructions, which lasted a long time before they left. It was heard that Chiang's instructions were extremely earnest, and the generals were deeply moved after listening to them respectfully. They then went to visit Minister He, who hosted a banquet to welcome them. It was decided that they would leave Nanjing on the morning of the 2nd to return to Shaanxi. The second group of Northeastern Army generals to come to Nanjing for instructions will set off after Wu and others arrive in Shaanxi. When the reporter visited Wu at his lodgings and asked about the visit to Zhejiang, it was said that they paid their respects to Zhang in Xikou and learned that Zhang was in good health and spirit. In addition to reading and writing every day, he also practiced mountain climbing. Zhang plans to stay in Xikou for a short period of time and hire a teacher to lecture him, and does not want to go elsewhere. Zhang earnestly admonished them, saying that the Shaanxi incident had become a thing of the past and should be written off, and no further discussion was allowed. Chairman Chiang treated the Northeastern Army very generously and had even greater expectations. They should obey Chairman Chiang's orders with sincerity so that the Northeastern Army could become a strong force and be used for national purposes, so as not to disappoint Chairman Chiang's expectations. From now on, they will only follow Zhang's words and strive forward under Chairman Chiang's leadership, hoping to show the people of the country with facts in the future, and are not willing to make more verbal exaggerations now. Finally, when talking about the defense area of the Northeastern Army, Wu said that he had heard that the superiors had made a new decision, but had not yet received an order to comply with it. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Duan, Director of the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance, arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 28th. On the morning of the 1st, he visited Wu Ke-ren, Deputy Army Commander of the Northeastern Army's 67th Army, and others. In the afternoon, he visited Chen Bulei to ask about the date to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. On the 2nd, he plans to visit Kong Xiangxi to explain the current financial difficulties of Gansu Province and discuss future reorganization measures. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Duan, Director of the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance, said that the situation in Shaanxi was indeed very serious at the time. Since Chairman Yu Xuezhong returned to Shaanxi from Lanzhou and met with the generals of the Northeastern Army, explaining the Central Government's generosity and virtue, and Zhang Xueliang's situation in Huaxi, the generals were very moved and the situation improved immediately. After several consultations between Director Gu Zhutong and Chairman Yu, the Shaanxi situation was peacefully resolved. Now, the military aspects have been completely agreed upon, and the political aspects will be decided within days, and the Central Government will issue an order for publication in the near future. All of Zhang Xueliang's troops will be transferred to the designated areas, and Zhang's troops will be led, trained, and reorganized by Yu. Yu will come to Nanjing within days to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. He came because of the financial difficulties in Gansu Province and still needs to see Minister Kong to ask for instructions on reorganization measures. In the past three months, the revenue and expenditure of Gansu Province could barely offset each other, but this cannot be said after the Shaanxi Incident. However, there is no need for the Central Government to provide additional funds at present. As long as the Central Government helps, the province can temporarily borrow money from the banking industry to regulate. If approved, he will go to Shanghai to negotiate loans with the banking industry. As for the feasibility of developing the Northwest economy, there are three points: First, please build the Xi'an-Lanzhou railway and complete the Northwest highway plan; Second, develop water conservancy, as the Northwest agricultural sector cannot develop due to lack of water; Third, improve animal husbandry and increase wool production.

Many important resolutions were made at the Third Plenary Session, all of which emphasized practicality, especially in the declaration, which contained almost no empty words and was entirely about grand plans for national salvation. Therefore, the importance of this plenary session exceeded all previous plenary sessions. He believed that comrades of the party should strive to implement the declaration, and not repeat the mistake of making decisions without acting on them. Furthermore, all important undertakings in various localities and the leadership of society should still be promoted with the party as the center. Some people believe that all local affairs can be handled by the government, and party headquarters are unnecessary. This kind of thinking is very wrong and should be corrected. He hoped that all comrades would intensify their efforts after this Third Plenary Session so that everything is controlled by the party, and then national rejuvenation can be achieved simply by waiting for it. Chairman 居正 concluded his remarks, and the service ended. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 1st)</p>

Chairman Lin led the service and then gave a speech on "Local Administration as the Foundation of National Politics." He explained that a country's administration can be divided into two parts: central administration and local administration. To govern a country well, it is necessary to rely on both effective central administration and careful attention to local administration. If local administration can be promoted smoothly, the entire national politics will have a solid foundation. Therefore, to improve the effectiveness of national politics, it is necessary to study local administration as the foundation of national politics. Next, he elaborated on the idea that local administration is the foundation of national politics, saying that many central government orders cannot be directly implemented by themselves and must rely on local governments to promote them to have a practical effect. Therefore, the work of central agencies focuses on decision-making, while local agencies focus on implementation. No matter how complete the policies decided by the central government, they will be useless if the local government cannot earnestly follow them. Moreover, the central government is relatively distant from the people, while the local government is closest to the people. If local politics is well managed, the people and the government will naturally have a good relationship, and thus they will be very concerned about the politics of the country, and they will also generate a strong political interest. This political interest is not only a basic element for the realization of democracy, but also the best magic weapon for unity. From this, it can be seen that local administration is the foundation of national politics, and central administration is its superstructure. If the foundation is solid, the entire national politics can be promoted to the fullest advantage. He further described the central issues that constitute local administration, one being the organization of local government, and the other being the powers of local government. For the former, in addition to mentioning that China, due to the bandit suppression in recent years, has temporarily improved local administrative efficiency by establishing administrative inspectors, setting up district offices, combining provincial government offices, and changing county government bureaus to sections in order to adapt to needs, he also said that how China's local administrative organization should be further improved in the future to enhance local administrative efficiency is still hoped that central and local officials and experts will continue to work hard and improve as much as possible based on practical experience and findings. For the latter, he said that under the system of balanced powers created by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, local governments, except for military, foreign affairs, currency, and other matters that are national in scope, can promote other matters that need to be adapted to local conditions without hindrance within their powers. Therefore, only when the central and local governments do their best and do not interfere with each other can national politics achieve sound development. This is the major principle that must be followed in determining the powers of local governments in the future. Finally, he hoped that everyone would jointly study to promote the rationalization of local administration and establish a strong foundation for the country.

<p>(London) A detailed report on the construction, design, speed, and tonnage of warships in various countries around the world was released today. According to the report, the Japanese government is currently building the fastest submarine in the world's navy. After the completion of the Japanese "I-72" class and "I-75" class submarines, the surface speed will reach 20 nautical miles per hour. The report also stated that the old British cruisers Coventry and Curlew have been converted into a new type of warship called anti-aircraft ships, equipped with ten 4-inch high-angle guns and eight mine tubes. The British "Tribal" class destroyers each displace 1,850 tons and have engines that reach 44,000 horsepower, an increase of about 10,000 horsepower compared to previous destroyers. Their speed is no more than 36 nautical miles. The ships will be equipped with eight 4.7-inch guns, twice as many as those installed on ordinary destroyers. Germany is currently building six destroyers with the same displacement as the "Tribal" class, but only equipped with five 5-inch guns. Although other countries' destroyers have been equipped with larger-caliber guns, British experts still consider the 4.7-inch gun to be the best weapon for destroyers. The two new battleships built by Britain, the George V and the Prince of Wales, will both be equipped with 14-inch gun positions. The two large battleships currently under construction in France have 15-inch gun positions. Italian battleships are also the same. The caliber of the guns on one of the 35,000-ton new German battleships is unknown. In the past two years, it has been widely rumored that the navies of several countries have built hundreds of motor torpedo boats, but according to this report, this is not the case. As of 1930, Britain had a total of 13 such warships built and under construction, France had built three, Germany had a total of 15 completed and uncompleted, and the United States, Japan, and Russia had none. Italy has a total of 36, including those built in 1917 and 1918, with little difference from those built recently. (Special dispatch from the Zi Lin West Daily, 28th)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Britain Returns Home, British and French Newspapers Speculate</h3>
<p>Germany Faces a Dilemma. National Socialist Party Actively Operating in England</p>
<p>(London) German Ambassador Ribbentrop left here the day before yesterday to return to his country. Although the stated purpose of this trip is to attend the opening ceremony of the Leipzig City Spring Fair in Germany, the newspapers here generally believe that the ambassador held talks with Foreign Secretary Eden the day before yesterday, and this trip is probably related to these talks. The diplomatic correspondent of the "Morning Post" declared that since the British government recently announced the amount of national defence expenditures, Germany must have felt that once this huge military build-up plan is completed, a large part of Germany's existing military equipment will be useless. Moreover, judging from the situation in the Spanish Civil War, the effectiveness of German military equipment is not as good as that of Soviet military equipment, which is also very obvious. From this, it can be seen that Germany's future is extremely bleak, and there are only two paths to follow in the future: one is to continue to engage in an arms race with various countries, but the result of the competition will inevitably be inferior; the other is to agree with these countries to stop expanding armaments. This is only left to the country to choose by itself. In short, today's situation is very unfavorable to Germany, and the country has often lost the opportunity to succeed in Europe." In addition, the Daily Herald and the News Chronicle both believe that after Ambassador Ribbentrop returns to his country this time, he will inevitably lose the favour of Führer Hitler, according to the Daily Herald, this is due to the machinations of Propaganda Minister Goebbels.

<p>(Paris) The German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, returned to London from London the day before yesterday. Among the newspapers in the French capital, only the right-wing "White Sun Daily" commented, saying: Ribbentrop was ordered to be an envoy to England, and the task he was entrusted with has now completely failed, because he had requested the British government to hold general negotiations on European issues, but British Foreign Secretary Eden remained unmoved, and only told the ambassador that, regarding the future Locarno Treaty issue, the British government had submitted a note on November 19 last year, but Germany had not yet replied, and recently Britain has again sent a letter to Germany, urging it to reply quickly. What the British government wants to know is whether Germany will guarantee the status quo in the Rhineland area, and whether the country will respect the independence of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Germany has not yet provided a satisfactory answer to this question, and the British government has really not been able to wait any longer. Therefore, after Ribbentrop returns to his country, if he cannot obtain a satisfactory answer from the German government, it is feared that there is no possibility of returning to his post." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, recently carried a report stating that the propaganda activities of the German National Socialist Party in the United Kingdom are now becoming increasingly developed. There are propaganda personnel sent by Germany distributing leaflets in various public houses in London and in British seaports, severely criticizing Jews and Communists. Many German students at British universities are also engaged in this work. In addition, German businessmen in London are very close to British people who can express sympathy for the National Socialist Party, in order to strengthen their connections.

However, the League of Nations must include all the nations of the world before it can be effective. Those nations that have not yet joined the League of Nations must always make them feel that they will benefit by joining the League of Nations, otherwise there will be no benefit to these nations.

<h3>German Residents in Czechoslovakia Demand Autonomy</h3>
<p>Safeguarding Minority Rights</p>
<p>(Prague) Henlein, the leader of the Sudeten German Party in Czechoslovakia, today presented conditions to the Czech government, demanding that the western part of Czechoslovakia, where the German-speaking minority is most prominent, be guaranteed its autonomy. Henlein did not recognize the minority agreement formally announced by the Czech government on February 20, and gave a speech in Aussig today, claiming that the agreement concluded between the Czech government and the German mixed political party cannot satisfy the wishes of the three million German residents in Czechoslovakia, and said that the demand for autonomy does not infringe on the territorial integrity of Czechoslovakia. Henlein also claimed that if his demands are not accepted, he will file a protest with Geneva, accusing the Czech government of imposing cultural oppression on the German minority. Previously, the Czech government had made considerable concessions to the German minority in its territory, such as employing Germans in factories and government positions, and using the German language more appropriately.

<h3>British Committee Releases Report on Hong Kong Maids</h3>
<p>Conflicting Opinions Among Committee Members; Suggestions for Improving the System of Employing Maids</p>
<p>(London) The report released today by the Anti-Slavery Committee states that the British Colonial Office and the governments of Hong Kong, Malaya, and other regions have not ignored or been negligent regarding the trafficking of women and children. The report provides a detailed account of the structure of Chinese families, stating that maids are considered members of the family. Therefore, strictly speaking, the practice of employing maids cannot be immediately considered a source of prostitution, as it is rare for maids to become prostitutes. Regarding the number of maids, opinions vary, with some estimating hundreds and others as many as ten thousand. However, without conducting a household-by-household investigation, it is impossible to obtain an accurate figure. The report also states that the treatment of maids varies, but generally speaking, maids receive treatment that is not much worse than other members of the family. The report further points out that the existence of the maid system is entirely for domestic service, not for the exploitation of the poor. While instances of abuse, abandonment, or rape do occur, they are rare and severely punished if discovered. However, Chinese family life is rapidly evolving, and the maid system is perceived as unjust and is gradually being abolished. The report also provides the following recommendations for improving the maid system: ㊀ Employers should ensure fair treatment of maids; ㊁ The employment of girls under the age of twelve should be prohibited; ㊂ Registered maids should no longer be employed as maids once they reach the age of eighteen; ㊃ Registered maids under the age of fourteen should be visited at least three times every six months; ㊄ Maids over the age of fourteen should be visited at least four times a year; ㊅ Former prostitutes should be segregated and housed separately. Ms. Picton-Turbervill, the author of the report on the maid system, advocates that existing laws should be abolished and replaced with new legislation to expedite the abolition of the current system and ensure strict supervision. (Central News Agency, 1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The report of the Anti-Slavery Committee on the issue of Hong Kong and Malayan maids can be broadly divided into two parts: the report of the majority of the committee members and the report of the minority. The report of the majority of the committee members, as mentioned in the previous telegram, recognizes maids as part of the Chinese family, whose purpose is to serve the family and not to exploit the poor. It also states that maids are not a source of prostitution and rarely become prostitutes. However, the report of the minority of the committee members is not as optimistic as the former and is not as satisfied with the current system as the other committee members. The majority of the committee's report provides a lengthy description of the Chinese family's practice of adopting daughters, but states that it is extremely difficult for Hong Kong maid owners to pass off maids as adopted daughters and deceive inspectors. As for the definition of a maid, it is recognized as a young girl who is transferred from one family to another to perform domestic work, receives no salary, and has no freedom to leave the employer. However, the difference between a maid and a domestic servant is that a maid is a member of the family, and when she reaches marriageable age (around eighteen), the employer arranges a suitable spouse for her to marry. The above is the report of the majority committee, signed by Chairman Sir Woodhead and Willis. Their views are the same as those of Sir Clementi, Sir Maxwell, the Roos Bay Committee, and the League of Nations Commission on Traffic in Women and Children, who have previously studied this issue. They also unequivocally state that maids and prostitutes cannot be compared, and that there are very few prostitutes who were previously maids. Therefore, under normal circumstances, maids are not exposed to moral danger. The report also states that the practice of employing maids in Hong Kong is rapidly being abolished. However, because the Chinese in Malaya are wealthier, the value of maids is also higher, so the reduction has not been as rapid as in Hong Kong, and registration is not as enthusiastic. However, according to what the investigators have personally witnessed, Malayan Chinese maids receive very good treatment. If one could start by punishing employers who fail to register, the same good results as in Hong Kong could be achieved. The report signed by the minority of committee members, Ms. Picton-Turbervill, expresses dissatisfaction with the current laws and requests that the thousands of unregistered maids in Hong Kong be dealt with immediately. Therefore, she advocates abolishing the existing Hong Kong and Malayan maid ordinances and replacing them with new legislation to promote the speedy abolition of the maid system. (Central News Agency, 1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore stated in the Lower House today, in response to questions from Labour Party members, that the Colonial Office intends to consult with the Hong Kong and Malayan governments regarding the recommendations in the majority and minority reports of the Committee on Maid Issues and conduct a careful review.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Significance of the Indian National Congress Party Victory in Elections</h3>
<p>— Auxiliary</p>
<p>At the end of last month, Reuters sent a dispatch from Mumbai stating the final results of the provincial elections under the new Indian constitution. The All-India National Congress Party has achieved unprecedented victories, gaining an absolute majority in administrative regions such as Mumbai and Madras, as well as in the United Provinces, Central Provinces, Bihar, and Orissa. In Bengal, Assam, and the Northwest Frontier Province, the Congress Party is the largest single party. Only in the Punjab and Sindh did the Congress Party receive fewer votes. The Congress Party's victory in Madras was particularly astonishing because the region had been the stronghold of the Justice Party for the past fourteen years. However, in this election, the Justice Party suffered a crushing defeat, winning only sixteen seats, while the Congress Party won one hundred and fifty-nine seats and gained a majority of twenty-six seats in the forty-six-seat upper house. The main reason the All-India National Congress Party was able to achieve such an unprecedented victory in this election is naturally due to their uniting voters from all classes and parties to fight for the independence and liberation of the Indian nation.</p>
<p>The holding of these provincial elections in British India is the initial procedure for implementing the new Indian constitution. This new constitution is the British imperialist's new magic weapon for ruling India. It was passed and announced in 1935 and is scheduled to be implemented on April 1 this year. The new constitution stipulates that India is a federal state, including the eleven provinces of British India and five hundred and sixty Indian princely states. The elections are now being held in the provinces of British India to organize parliaments, and then representatives will be elected from the British provinces, with one hundred and fifty-six members for the upper house and two hundred and fifty members for the lower house. The Indian princely states will elect one hundred and four representatives to the upper house and one hundred and twenty-five representatives to the lower house to form the Federal Upper House and Lower House. Under the new constitution, in addition to obtaining extremely limited autonomy, all important ruling powers remain in the hands of the Governor-General of India, specially appointed by the British Empire. Therefore, the National Congress Party has adopted a firm opposition to this new constitution. President Nehru also said that this constitution is "a chain of slavery" that must be broken.</p>
<p>Since the National Congress Party firmly opposes this "chain of slavery," why are they now participating in the provincial elections under this constitution and even achieving an unprecedented victory? This attitude may seem very contradictory at first glance, but in fact, there is a great principle behind it. This is stated very clearly in the declaration issued by the All-India National Congress held in Faizpur at the end of December last year. We can quote it as follows: "The Congress opposes the entire new constitution and clearly declares that any constitution formulated by foreign forces that hinders the sovereignty of the Indian people and does not recognize the Indian people's right to govern their political and economic organization is unacceptable. In order to prevent the strengthening of foreign rule and exploitation, the Congress has decided to participate in the upcoming provincial council elections. However, the purpose of the Congress representatives participating in the parliament is not to comply with the new constitution but to find ways to break it and end it."</p>
<p>As a result of these provincial elections, the Congress Party has gained a great victory. Therefore, they have a good chance of succeeding in their goal of shattering the new constitution. As for whether the Congress Party will participate in the organization of the provincial governments afterwards, the last Congress did not decide and must wait for the Executive Committee to decide at its meeting in Delhi this month. No matter how this question is decided in the future, the All-India National Congress's attitude of opposition to the new constitution will not change. The last Congress declaration stated, "Regardless of the resolution of this issue, we must remember that the Congress is absolutely opposed to this new constitution and will never cooperate with it. Our only goal is the end of the new constitution. Therefore, we must make every effort to prevent the implementation of this federal constitution, because the effect of this constitution is to allow imperialist and feudal interests to forever rule over the entire country of India and prevent all progress towards freedom."</p>
<p>India's national liberation movement has embarked on a clear path in recent years under the leadership of the All-India National Congress. The unprecedented advantage gained by the National Congress Party in the provincial elections is a symbol of the victory of the liberation movement. We, who are in a semi-colonial position, should not only celebrate the future of India's national liberation movement, but also reflect on ourselves and find ways to rescue ourselves from the trap of semi-colonialism.</p>
<h3>Japanese Delegation of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive on the 14th; Kodama Discusses the Mission of This Trip</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japan-China Trade Association held a board meeting at 2:00 PM on the 1st and decided to invite Chairman Kodama and other directors to attend the general meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association in Shanghai on March 18. They also discussed and agreed on the selection of directors to attend. As a result, the official list of attendees from Tokyo is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Kenji Kodama, Director President of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) Noboru Ohtani, President of the Bank of Chosen (Korea) Keizo Kato, Employee of Mitsubishi Corporation Hyotaro Miyakegawa, President of Nisshin Spinning Co., Ltd. Seijiro Miyajima, Employee of Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. Reisuke Ishida, President of Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (Nisshin Steamship Co., Ltd.) Hori, Akiyama from Mitsubishi Corporation, and Yutani, Director of the Japan-China Trade Association. From Osaka, there will be Managing Director of Sumitomo Bank, Ohira, and President of Toyo Spinning Co., Ltd. Iio. However, two or three more people will be added from Osaka. The group is scheduled to depart from Kobe on the Nagasaki Maru on March 12 and arrive in Shanghai on the 14th.</p>
<p>After the board meeting, Chairman Kodama gave a speech stating that he was attending the general meeting at the invitation of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association. According to the association's charter, the meeting should have been held in the spring of last year, but it was suspended due to a sudden incident on the Japanese side. It was then postponed to autumn, but due to the not-so-good relations between China and Japan at the time, it was rescheduled for this spring. The Chinese side seems to have very high expectations for them, or may propose substantial counter-proposals on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. He said that he would do his best to acknowledge the other party's requests and hopes. Since returning to Japan from his position as the branch manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank in Shanghai in 1920, he has not visited China. Although he does not know any young Chinese people, he knows many people such as Chiang Kai-shek and other financial leaders. Therefore, he plans to meet with various key figures in the Nanjing government. As for Yasukawa, the president of the East Asia Development Company (Taku), he plans to inspect Manchuria and North China and will likely return to Shanghai around April. Therefore, they will not be able to travel together with him. (1st Allied Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Circles Pay Close Attention to Japanese Prime Minister's Pro-British Policy</h3>
<p>The Netherlands Unwilling to Sign Non-Aggression Treaty; Japan Plans to Improve Relations with Russia</p>
<p>(London) Circles here concerned with Far Eastern affairs are paying close attention to the speech given yesterday in the House of Representatives by Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senjuro Hayashi regarding Japan's desire to increase Anglo-Japanese friendship and to resolve the immigration issue with Australia. Many acknowledge the sincerity of Mr. Hayashi and believe that his words represent the views of the Japanese military and should be considered separately from the statements made by civil servants. Former Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Newton told a Reuters reporter today, "I have always regretted the dissolution of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. I firmly believe that restoring close Anglo-Japanese relations will lead to peace and security in the Far East and will directly benefit China." Sir Frederick Whyte, who served as a political advisor to the Chinese government from 1929 to 1932, believes that Japan has now realized that it must work to eliminate the effects of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany abroad. Furthermore, a banker in the Far East expressed the view that some people are now guiding the United States to lean towards a mutual assistance agreement between France and Russia, which Japan is deeply concerned about, so it is seeking ways to counter it. Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Bruce mentioned the Japanese immigration issue, saying that he was unaware of any hope of discussing the immigration issue in the near future. This is purely an economic issue and has nothing to do with the human aspect. The Australian people mostly love and admire the Japanese people, but we are constantly seeking to maintain a certain standard of living for all types of workers. (Central News Agency, 1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙The Hague Someone inquired of a key figure today about the attitude of the Dutch authorities regarding the issue of Japan's Prime Minister Hayashi's statement in parliament yesterday that Japan would study the possibility of concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Netherlands and seeking to lease the Dutch New Guinea island. The reply was that concluding a non-aggression treaty is not in line with the Dutch government's policies. Japan stated that the right to cede New Guinea would be considered by the Dutch East Indies government. However, it should be known that the Dutch government has already granted several rights to cede cottonwood on the islands of New Guinea and Borneo to Japan. The official also firmly stated that the Dutch government is now pursuing an open-door policy in the Dutch East Indies. (Central News Agency, 1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is heard that Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hayashi will soon instruct Japanese Ambassador to Russia Mamoru Shigemitsu to eliminate the Soviet authorities' misunderstanding of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany in order to improve relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. The procedure for this has not yet been revealed. However, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun, this move may be a prelude to Japan slightly delaying the submission of certain economic and cultural proposals to the Soviet Union. The newspaper also stated that many officials in Tokyo now feel that the anti-Japanese atmosphere in the Soviet Union has reached its extreme, so they believe that the cabinet should urgently take action to improve this situation so that Japan's "Far East stabilizing force" can be stabilized.

<h3>Japanese Seamen's Strike Expands</h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese Services Operate as Usual</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Meirokai (Bright Enlightenment Association) of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) suddenly launched a reform movement on the 28th under the banner of reforming the company's concept of national polity (Kokutai Meicho). At the same time, they telegraphed crew members on ships anchored at Osaka, Kobe, and Yokohama, as well as those currently sailing in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and nearby waters, ordering them to leave their ships. Forty-five land-based employees in Tokyo and Yokohama, as well as crew members on ships in Yokohama, gathered at the training hall operated by Eigoro Matsuda in Nishisugamo-cho, Toshima Ward, after receiving the order. The headquarters of the strike group at the Keihin Ryokan in front of Shinagawa Station considered countermeasures overnight. The company authorities were very alarmed by the sudden strike and dispatched the deputy director of the maritime affairs department to the Metropolitan Police Department yesterday afternoon to meet with Mr. Kitamura, the head of the labor section, to explain the entire situation. After the Meirokai launched the strike, various Japanist groups, such as the Current Affairs Council, the Political Reform Council, and the New Japan Seamen's Union, actively supported it, and the momentum was very strong. The strike leaders are determined to fight to the end in order to achieve their demands and are preparing for a long-term strike. Regarding the dispute of the Meirokai, the shipping company has decided to firmly adhere to the policy of dismissal based on Article 581 of the Commercial Code and Article 26 of the Seamen's Law. The chief engineer and four other engineers of the List Bow Maru, as well as the third-class engineer of the Malacca Maru, have already been dismissed as a result and replacements have been made. As a result, the ships that departed from Kobe on the 1st were delayed for several hours due to dismissals and replacements, but they have all left port. (1st Allied Press dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Nagasaki The strike that broke out centered on the "Meirokai" of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) senior crew members, which temporarily endangered the Sino-Japanese liaison ship services, resumed operations as usual on the 1st, departing at 1:00 PM. (1st Allied Press dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Several Germans in Moscow and Leningrad who were arrested in mid-November last year on charges of counter-revolution and espionage were decided by the Soviet Interior Ministry on February 16 to be deported. On the 27th of last month, a counselor from the German Embassy met with representatives from the Foreign and Interior Ministries and talked with the deportees for two hours. During the conversation, Tito and Fefa told the German counselor that they did not want to return to Germany. Fefa said that he would rather stay in the Soviet Union and serve his sentence. If he had to be sent back to Germany, he would commit suicide when crossing the border. Tito requested to be sent to another country, claiming that he could prove that he was also a British citizen. Tito, Gaerxi, Mid, and Merche were sent out of the Soviet-Polish border yesterday. After Tito crossed the border, he had the opportunity to resolve his citizenship and place of residence. Fefa's deportation was temporarily suspended in order to obtain an entry passport to another country.

<h3>An Overview of the Situation in Spain</h3>
<p>Government Forces Shift from Defense to Offense; British Newspaper Correspondent's Observations</p>
<p>(London)</p>
<p>Bertolot, a reporter for the News Article Newspaper, recently went to the territory controlled by the Spanish government forces to conduct an on-site investigation. He recently published an article on the findings, stating: "The most serious problem facing the government is the issue of internal organization. The country urgently needs a leader like Napoleon of France. Unfortunately, there are no talents there sufficient to speak of this. The government forces have now changed their strategy from defense to offense. Assigning the troops of the Central Route Army to General Miaja, Chairman of the Madrid City Defense Committee, for his personal command is the first step in changing the strategy. It is expected that the Valencia government will also appoint commissioners to control food supply and transportation matters. If the traffic conditions between Madrid and Valencia can be improved as soon as possible, the government forces will certainly have a great advantage in the future of the war. For example, Madrid's supply is in danger of being depleted, but if it is said that its source is exhausted, it is better to say that its distribution is not good. This can be seen in the supply of kerosene." As for personnel matters, Premier Caballero was an indispensable figure at the beginning of the civil war, and contributed a lot to unity at that time. Up until now, all parties and factions have eliminated prejudices in order to win the final victory, so Caballero's age and position are not as important as before. In addition, the military talents of General Miaja, Chairman of the Defense Committee, are still not recognized by the general public. "But judging from the current situation, it is increasingly impossible for the Nationalists to directly capture Madrid. If the security of transportation in the government-controlled area, the security of the city of Valencia, and even the security of the entire Spain, are to be maintained, then the leaders of the political and military circles must show greater courage and a greater spirit of sacrifice, just as the Basque Autonomous Region troops on the front line of the Manzanares River south of the capital have done, in order to succeed. When I inspected the front line, every soldier of the region was able to bravely fight the enemy without fear. This is truly commendable." (Central News Agency, 1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Artillery Battles Around Madrid</h3>
<p>Government Army Positions Consolidated</p>
<p>⊙Madrid Government forces bombarded the university city district today with artillery fire. The rebels did not return fire, apparently to save ammunition. At the same time, government forces on the southern front launched a surprise attack with artillery and Russian tanks. Three tanks were destroyed by the rebels. One of them was captured by the rebels near Cubretura. However, government forces are still trying to use hand grenades to break through the rebel machine gun teams there. In the Jarama River area, the rebels launched a fierce attack for several hours, but made no progress. (28th National News dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Madrid The town of Maranosa, near the Garama River, southeast of the capital, is now surrounded by government forces. This morning, Nationalist forces launched several attacks in an attempt to drive back government forces, but after fighting fiercely for several hours, the government forces' positions remained unmoved. The Nationalist forces eventually retreated without success. In addition, Nationalist forces in the Toledo area south of the capital are now relying on fortifications around the northeastern gate of the city to defend it. Government forces took advantage of their unpreparedness and raided the Nationalist forces' positions, and after reconnaissance of the terrain, safely withdrew.

<h3>Spanish Nationalist Forces Deny Executing Hollywood Actress</h3>
<p>⊙Avila: A foreign report stated that Ms. Diss, an American Hollywood movie star, was arrested by the Nationalist forces in Seville, southern Spain, for being a spy for the Spanish government army.

Local authorities here recently denied this claim, stating that Ms. Diss had already traveled to Portugal and is currently still within Portuguese territory.

<h3>Unfortunate Incident in Wuchang: Clash Between Students and Soldiers</h3>
<p>Bo Wen Middle School Surrounded and Fired Upon by Garrison Troops; Principal Petitions Education Bureau to Request Protection from Authorities</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: At 1 p.m. on the 27th, Bo Wen Middle School in Wuchang and the nearby stationed army heavy mortar battalion had a dispute over a trivial matter between a student and the battalion's company commander, leading to a clash. This resulted in an unfortunate incident involving a demonstration of gunfire and the surrounding of the school. The school is located outside the Dadongmen gate, midway along the Wuluo Motor Road. Most of the students are from Wuhan. The Road Bureau, to facilitate the students, set up a station outside the school. The 27th was a Saturday, and the afternoon was a regular holiday. Many students were waiting at the station to return home. At about 1 p.m., a bus arrived from Wuhan University in Luojia Mountain. As the students were about to board, Xiong Zaixun, the company commander of the army heavy mortar battalion, and a platoon leader stood in the doorway, making it difficult for the students to board. The students asked them to make way, but they refused to pay attention. Ji Yuan, a freshman at the school, who was very young, stepped forward to negotiate. A misunderstanding arose during the conversation, and the company commander struck him with a heavy blow. The student then retaliated against Xiong, and a conflict broke out. Cai Huifu, the school principal, Dong Zhengchu, the director of education, Xiao Guogui, the director of discipline, and Wang Rongwu, the military instructor, rushed to the scene. They restrained the students and invited Xiong into the school to talk, hoping to resolve the matter peacefully. Unexpectedly, a platoon leader who followed Xiong, seeing Xiong enter the school, ran back to the company headquarters and urgently summoned sixty armed soldiers, who set off for the school. The company headquarters was stationed at Changchun Temple, which was only a few steps away from the school, and they arrived in an instant. They immediately surrounded the school and fired more than twenty shots in a show of force. Teachers and staff who went out to mediate were beaten severely with gun butts, and a school worker was also injured. Many doors and windows were damaged, and the situation was very serious. Nearby residents were panicked, and order almost broke down. Gao Jieying, a patrol officer from the Third Police Sub-Bureau, quickly led more than ten police officers to suppress the situation. The soldiers refused to be restrained, and a conflict with the police officers was about to erupt. Fortunately, Lin Liqiu, the company commander of the special company of the military police battalion, arrived with many military police officers and worked together to resolve the situation. Only then did Company Commander Xiong order the soldiers to retreat. Shortly after, Liu Ganyan, the adjutant of the Wuchang District Command of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, and Kong Fanmei, the battalion commander of the battalion, arrived at the school to investigate the truth of the incident. After discussions among all parties, it was decided that Battalion Commander Kong would be responsible for the demonstration of gunfire and surrounding the school, and the company and platoon leaders would be punished. Principal Cai would be responsible for investigating and punishing the students who made inappropriate remarks. Both sides restrained the soldiers and students, preventing further clashes. The major crisis was temporarily calmed down. However, the school authorities, fearing that the school and the company's garrison were in close proximity, and that other incidents might arise in the future, Principal Cai went to the Education Bureau to personally report everything to Director Zhou. Today, he submitted another report to the Education Bureau, requesting that it be forwarded to the highest military authorities for protection. (28th)</p>
<h3>Southwest Airlines Plane "Chang Geng" Lost in Fog</h3>
<p>Wu Bofan and Pilot Perish Together</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Southwest Airlines has been flying two or three planes between Guangdong and Guangxi. Recently, the company was reorganized, with increased capital from Yunnan and Guizhou. The company's business will soon expand greatly, opening routes to Yunnan and Guizhou. The civilian aircraft purchased by the company will soon be shipped from the United States to Guangdong. Once the new aircraft arrive, they will fly to Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. However, recently, the capital of Guangxi Province moved to Guilin, and the Southwest Airlines planes have also changed their route to the Guilin line. They take off from Guangzhou, first arrive in Guilin, then go through Liuzhou, and then to Nanning (previously, they went from Guangzhou through Wuzhou, passing Guixian, and directly to Yongcheng). Recently, Dr. Wu Bofan, a consultant to the Shaanxi Provincial Government and an expert in developing alcohol as a substitute for gasoline, was invited by Guangdong to come to Guangdong to test the use of alcohol as a substitute for gasoline. The test results were excellent. After staying in Guangdong for several weeks, the Guangxi Provincial authorities, having heard of Wu's reputation, also telegraphed Wu to go to Guangxi to test his method of using alcohol as a substitute for gasoline. With the introduction of Kan Zonghua, the director of the Guangxi Pacification Commissioner's Office in Guangdong, Wu agreed to fly to Guilin on the Southwest Airlines plane "Chang Geng" on February 22. Unexpectedly, after flying from Guangzhou for only a few tens of minutes, when they regularly reached the jurisdiction of Sanshui County, the weather suddenly changed, and a thick fog covered the sky. The pilot, finding it difficult to navigate in the fog, planned to temporarily land in the jurisdiction of Sanshui County. Unexpectedly, the aircraft suddenly malfunctioned at this time, and plummeted from a height of over a thousand feet. The Sanshui County Government, upon hearing the news, assumed that the crashed aircraft had landed on land and immediately sent people to investigate. However, they could not find any trace of it. Later, according to reports from local people, there was a slick of gasoline floating on the surface of the Qingqi River near Shangduanfeng Township in the jurisdiction of Sanshui County, suspected that the crashed aircraft had fallen into the water. In addition to sending people to salvage, they also telegraphed the province to report to the relevant authorities. Southwest Airlines, upon receiving the report, immediately sent personnel to investigate. At the same time, the Fourth Route Army Headquarters also sent Luo Guangqian, a section chief from the Adjutant's Office, and Adjutant Liu Zhao to Sanshui to inquire about everything. On the 24th, they hired people in the Sanshui River to dive and salvage the "Chang Geng" aircraft that had fallen into the water, but it was still nowhere to be found. It is expected that if the aircraft did fall into the water, then the people on board would have been drowned and could not be saved. Many who heard the news mourned. It was found that on that day, there was only one passenger on the plane, Wu Bofan, and a small amount of mail. The pilot was Zhan Daoyu. Zhan was the son of an overseas Chinese. He graduated from the former Guangdong Aviation School and had many years of service in Southwest Airlines. His skills were quite proficient. This incident was truly unexpected.</p>
<h3>Soldiers of the Hailianhui in Zhanhua County, Shandong Mutiny</h3>
<p>Resisting Orders and Opening Fire, Refusing to Be Accepted; Liu Yaoting Dispatches Troops to Suppress, Now Disbanded; Mutiny Leader Gao Shutang and Others Escorted to Ji'nan for Trial</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Bin County, Putai, Lijin, Zhanhua, Wudi, and other counties in northern Shandong are located near the sea, with complex harbors and bays. Sea bandits often disturb the local area. Although there is an organization called the Hailianhui (Sea Defense Association), its capabilities are still limited. Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, in order to thoroughly eliminate bandits and consolidate the sea defense of northern Shandong, specially appointed Liu Yaoting, the deputy commander of the Fifth Security District of Shandong Province and the captain of the Third Special Investigation Team, as the commander of the Northern Shandong Maritime Security Team, and Zhu Shiqin, the captain of the Fourth Special Investigation Team, as the deputy commander. The original three squadrons of the Hailianhui were transferred to Liu for reorganization. Upon receiving the order, Liu led Deputy Commander Zhu Shiqin and others to Xiawa in Zhanhua County a few days ago to take over the Hailianhui and establish the Maritime Security Headquarters. The First Squadron of the Hailianhui stationed in Xiawa, led by Wang Gongchen, obeyed the order to reorganize. Liu then dispatched Deputy Commander Zhu Shiqin to Jiushan Village in Zhanhua on the 26th to take over the Second Squadron, led by Gao Shutang. Gao Shutang refused to be accepted, and even deployed troops in a show of force. That night, they mutinied. Zhu immediately returned to Xiawa and reported to Liu. Liu then dispatched Wang Gongchen, the captain of the First Squadron of the Maritime Security Team, together with Zhu, leading the security team and more than a hundred investigators to quell the rebellion. Zhu and others arrived at Jiushan Village early this morning (the 27th). Gao Shutang actually led the rebellious troops to open fire in resistance. After three hours of fierce fighting, they were finally captured, and his deputy captain was killed, along with four rebellious soldiers. The rest were all captured, totaling more than fifty people, and taken to Xiawa. Liu escorted the mutiny leader Gao Shutang and eight others to Jinan that night, to be handed over to the military law department of the Third Route Army Headquarters for legal action tomorrow (the 28th). Liu also decided to visit Chairman Han tomorrow (the 28th) to report on the events. The remaining rebellious soldiers have been detained in Xiawa to await orders for handling.</p>
<h3>Summary of Sino-British Continued Survey of the Southern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Boundary</h3>
<p>—Location: Lao Chang, in the Hinterland of Yunnan Province—(Continued)</p>
<p>Border New Year's Day</p>
<p>The first day of January in the 26th year [of the Republic] was New Year's Day and the anniversary of the founding of the Republic. The Chinese commissioners held a rare celebration of the Republic's founding and a group greeting ceremony. At about 10 a.m., all the staff, guards, officers and soldiers, as well as the various chieftain (Tusi), gathered at the meeting ground to participate. Commissioners Liang and Zhang successively gave speeches, briefly stating that the founding of the Republic was difficult, and that such a grand event on the border was even more rare. We should embody this spirit, strive to promote and carry forward the traditions of our predecessors, and so on.</p>
<p>Formal Meeting</p>
<p>The Boundary Survey Committee scheduled its first session of the term for January 2nd at our camp, continuing from the previous term (referred to as the 68th meeting). At 10 a.m., Neutral Chairman Mr. E and Secretary Mr. P arrived first, followed by the British commissioners and Secretary Mr. C. At 10:20 a.m., the meeting began. First, Mr. E gave a speech, briefly describing the process by which the Political Bureau of the League of Nations notified them of the second Sino-British joint survey of the Yunnan-Burma border. He then stated the reasons for deciding on Lao Chang as the meeting place, and then inquired in detail about the security, sanitation, transportation, and other items of both sides. He then recited Article 3 of the supplementary provisions of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of the 23rd year of Guangxu (i.e., 1897), stating the scope of the work this time. He also briefly mentioned the procedures for this term's work. The meeting adjourned at 11 a.m. The Chinese commissioners held a banquet that day for the neutral chairman and his secretary, as well as the British commissioners, their secretary, and the officers of the guards. After the meeting adjourned, there was a short rest, and at 1 p.m. everyone took their seats. The guests and hosts parted happily at 3 p.m. In the days that followed, meetings and on-site surveys continued, and everyone was extremely busy.</p>
<p>National Concern</p>
<p>Yunnan Province is located on the border. Since the Pan Hong Incident, the Chinese people have begun to pay attention to the Yunnan border. Since the last Sino-British joint survey, news about the border has repeatedly appeared in newspapers. Although all parties have a clear idea of the Yunnan border, many still do not understand the intention of the joint survey and have misunderstandings. Some mistakenly believe that this survey is a "border demarcation," and others mistakenly believe that it is a "border definition," as if the boundary line would be determined after the survey. There are quite a few people who hold this view. Commissioners Liang and Zhang have already explained this in a speech at the Yunnan Provincial Party Headquarters last January. There are still some who do not understand the joint survey based on the treaty and have questions about the measurement of the undefined boundary area by both parties. The Chinese Commissioners' Office has separately answered them in letters. Among them, the official letter from the office to a certain county council is the most clear. The letter is as follows (omitted above): "Regarding the first point, the so-called western boundary of Lancang should be extended to the Nujiang River" truly encompasses the entire territory of Wa, Shan, and others west of the Nanjian River. However, this statement is close to ideal. It is neither recorded in the treaty nor included in the Zhenbian map. Liu and Chen's boundary survey also strictly adhered to Laimu Nanka and have not heard of any proposal to reach Gunlong in the west. This commissioner was ordered by the central government to survey the national border and conduct foreign negotiations, all based on the treaty. Abandoning the treaty and relying on ideals, I am deeply afraid that it will be difficult to convince people. The Guangxu 23rd year treaty should be adhered to in good faith. The third item, fourth section, states: "The area of Zhenbian Hall belongs to China, following the Shun Nanjian River... Mengyun belongs to China, Menglun belongs to Britain, etc." This commissioner has not heard that the western boundary of Zhenbian can reach the Nujiang River, so it is not convenient to violate the treaty and make a statement that would be taken lightly. Conducting a survey based on the treaty is a policy that has been determined by the central government. This commissioner恪 keeps the 部令, conducts the boundary affairs, and the authority is limited, and should be understood by the people of the country. As for Lao Chang and other places are all in the hinterland of Yunnan, which is known to China and foreign countries, the British side came here to measure is one thing, and the delimitation of the boundary is another thing, not to say that the land once measured by the other side of the sovereignty will be lost, or that the undefined boundary, is referred to as the Scott-Kirk Red Line and the Liu-Chen-Huang Line area. The British side carried out surveys in areas outside the red line, and our side also sent personnel to conduct surveys in Huban, Feima Mountain, Nangun River, Bangge, Lufang and other places outside the yellow line, and drew detailed maps. There is a mutual understanding, so that the staff of both sides can be facilitated, and is responsible for protection, this method, has long been the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lei Da Yunnan Provincial Government to check on file, this member also reiterated in the previous session, all measurement business, purely technical work, and the sovereignty of both sides, completely irrelevant, this section has been filed, and by the neutral chairman, added to the supervision, to avoid the bad to say that, "Lufang although the British army stationed, after all, can not be regarded as their own" one section seems to be a misunderstanding, our side sent personnel to the site to measure, originally no need to consult the British army agreed, agreed to say, is the British side in view of the Committee's decision, and to express its attitude this commissioner does not recognize the military occupation as legitimate, also do not work the British army agreed and then sent personnel to carry out the test, scrolls are in place, can be reviewed, the above two points, through explanation, can be understood, in short, this committee to deal with the boundary affairs, the internal恪 follow the 部令, 外 then according to the treaty to fight, duty, position such as this, in addition to the provincial party headquarters in the speech has been detailed in Chen said that this quasi-forward, the corresponding reply."</p>
<p>The latest developments, I heard that on January 14th, both sides had moved to Mengsuo for more detailed discussions.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Strictly Prohibits Police from Growing Hair</h3>
<p>The County Police Bureau previously issued an order to its members, prohibiting them from growing hair, and strictly stipulated penalties. Now, with the passage of time, it is feared that old habits may reappear, which would violate the original intention of the New Life Movement. Dong Xueshu, the bureau chief, re-emphasized the previous order on the 28th, stipulating that those who have already grown hair must shave it off completely today. Those who violate the order after the deadline will be severely punished. All officers are ordered to be responsible for reporting violations, otherwise they will be held jointly liable, in order to emphasize the importance of the order.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Flour Mills All Profitable</h3>
<p>In this county, besides Tailong Flour Mill, which was burned down last year, there are also Jiufeng and Maoxin Nos. 1 and 2 Mills. They produce a large quantity of flour every year, which is sold to various places. Business is thriving. Last year, each mill had a profit of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. In addition, there are more than 30 flour bran shops, including Hengmao, Hengxie, Wanfengchang, Taifeng, Yifeng, Yongyuanfeng, etc. Last year, due to the soaring price of flour, all the shops made a large profit. Those with a larger business scope could make a profit of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, while smaller ones could make 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. At present, the price of flour in Wuxi is lower than last year. Green Mountain Deer brand flour is sold for 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 1 to 2 fen per bag.</p>
<h3>Changzhou County Government Surveys and Builds Wu Huang Road</h3>
<p>The county government believes that the transportation in Huangli Town, the ninth district of the county, has always been inconvenient. Usually, people rely on boats for travel, and the distance is 60 li long. Therefore, it is planned to build a highway in order to promote the development of agriculture and commerce. Technical staff member Yu Mengyin has been dispatched to start surveying the road. It is estimated that it will be 30 kilometers long, passing through the first, second, and ninth districts. The width is set at 7.5 meters. The roadbed will be built by requisitioning labor. After completion, bids will be invited from merchants to contract for the operation of cars. Once the survey is completed, drawings will be made, and a budget will be prepared and submitted to the department for approval to start construction.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Difficulties in Opening Traffic at Langfu Ferry</p>
<p>Jiangnan and Jiangbei traffic is blocked. People from various counties in Tongzhou advocate opening a ferry on the Jiangmian River at Langfu Ferry in Nantong Changshu, so that Jiangnan and Jiangbei highway traffic can be connected. The nautical community representatives have surveyed and reported that the shoals on both sides are too long and difficult to ascend and descend, so it is difficult to open this traffic.</p>
<h3>Employee of Haizhou Telegraph Bureau Murdered</h3>
<p>Wang Zhilan, a native of Xiangshuikou, Guanyun County, 27 years old, worked as a telegraph operator at the local telegraph bureau. The night before, he was murdered with a kitchen knife in the bedroom of Zhang Xiaoyun, the female director of the Haifeng Hospital. The next morning, a villager named Wang took his young child to the hospital for treatment. He walked into the hospital gate, but there was no sound. He walked to the back room and caught sight of a corpse with more than ten knife wounds, lying in a pool of blood. It was a terrible sight. Two kitchen knives were discarded on the ground. Wang was frightened and screamed wildly. Neighbors gathered from all directions. Someone who recognized the deceased ran to tell his family. His family rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and mourned over the body. The people in the hospital had already fled. The deceased's family immediately reported to the county government to send someone to investigate and arrest the murderer.</p>

The entire meeting unanimously agreed to pass the following resolutions: ㊀ Athletics Field: It was decided to remodel the Gaien Athletics Field. ㊁ Ball Fields: Located at the site of the Aoyama Shooting Range. ㊂ Swimming Pools: Divided into two locations, one being the renovated Meiji Jingu Swimming Pool, and the other being a newly built one in Shiba Park. ㊃ Cycling Track: Located in Shibaura. ㊄ Motorboat Racing: Located in Ominato. ㊅ Rowing: Located in Toda Village. ㊆ Olympic Village: Located in Kinuta Village.</p>
<p>Funding Secured</p>
<p>The most difficult issue was the funding for the Games. The previous committee approved a standard budget of 10 million yuan. Now, the Ministry of Finance has agreed to allocate 5 million yuan. The remaining funds will be raised by the committee. Today, the Asahi Shimbun donated 10,000 yuan, and the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun donated 5,110 yuan. Australian Hume Lewin is promoting the Games overseas and has discussed a significant donation with Earl of Rosebery. Based on observations from all sides, funding has been secured.</p>
<p>Swimming Pool Plans</p>
<p>Regarding the remodeling of the Gaien Swimming Pool, the Ministry of Railways has conducted a thorough investigation and concluded that "remodeling is possible." Therefore, at the organizing committee meeting on the 23rd, the Director of the Tourism Bureau reported on the preliminary design of the swimming pool, which was divided into two plans: ㊀ Plan 1: The current swimming pool will be remodeled according to the four central lines. ㊀ Use steel-reinforced concrete (with iron plates inside the walls to prevent fire) to create a four-legged, three-arched tunnel-style covering, 10 meters wide, 120 meters long, and 1,200 square meters in volume. ㊁ The construction cost is 320,000 yuan. ㊂ The construction period is limited to five months from the start of construction to completion. (二) Plan 2: To facilitate transportation for the Games, the swimming pool's visitor seating area will be improved, including a new underground station. ㊀ Also use steel-reinforced concrete to create a seven-legged, six-arched tunnel-style covering, 20 meters wide, 120 meters long, and 2,400 square meters in volume. ㊁ The construction cost is 680,000 yuan, and the construction period is seven to eight months. Which plan will be adopted has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Teacher Zhang ChuanDao of E Province Middle School Accuses Director Zhou TianFang of the Education Department</h3>
<p>Zhang Requested to See Zhou But Did Not Meet, Made Harsh Remarks - Zhou Arrested Zhang for Insulting a Superior - The Court Accepted the Case and the Debate Between Both Parties Concluded</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the newly appointed Director of the Education Department, Zhou Tianfang, took office, Zhang ChuanDao, a teacher at the Provincial Zhongxiang Middle School, visited him to present his views on educational reform. Because he failed to meet Zhou twice, his language inevitably insulted Zhou's dignity. Zhou, therefore, arrested Zhang on charges of insulting a superior, destroying public property, and obstructing official duties, and sent him to the Provincial Police Department, who transferred him to the Wuchang District Court for legal proceedings. Zhang also hired lawyers Wang Zhaoxiang, Xia Rishi, and Zhang Jixiang to file a complaint against Zhou for abusing his authority, dereliction of duty, infringing on freedom, and fabricating false charges. The court accepted the case, and at 2:30 PM on the 27th, the criminal division of the court opened the trial in the first courtroom. Liu Xianji served as the presiding judge. Because the defendant was the current Director of the Education Department, and he was in court against his subordinate teacher, the visitor seats were very crowded. However, Zhou did not personally attend the hearing due to official duties. After the court opened, the presiding judge first questioned the plaintiff about the four parts of the charges: abuse of power, dereliction of duty, infringement of freedom, and fabrication of false charges. Zhang testified, "On the afternoon of January 15th, I went to the Education Department to visit Director Zhou to present my views on education. The secretary, Yu Longxi, met me on his behalf. He said that the Director was busy and arranged for me to visit again at 2:00 PM on the 17th. I went on time on the 17th and first handed my business card to the reception. I was led into the reception room, and the receptionist then told me that the Director would not see me. I told him that Secretary Yu had made an appointment beforehand, so why would he not see me? Because educational officials should not have this bureaucratic habit. I told the receptionist to report again. Soon, the receptionist came back and told me to wait in the reception room. By 4:00 PM, he still hadn't come out, so I left the Department and returned home. Unexpectedly, as I was leaving the Provincial Government gate, armed guards rushed up and said that the Director would see me and ordered me to turn back. At the same time, they ordered the sentry at the Provincial Government gate to prevent me from leaving. Then, a platoon leader of the Education Department's guards, named Su, held a letter from the Education Department, saying that he was ordered to send me to the Provincial Police Department. After I was taken to the Police Department, I was detained overnight and then transferred to the Prosecutor's Office of the Court. The Education Department's letter stated that I had insulted a superior, damaged public property, and obstructed official duties. This was an abuse of authority and illegal arrest, so I filed a private prosecution." Next, the defendant Zhou Tianfang was summoned. Zhou did not appear, and the Education Department's secretary, Yu Longxi, appeared in court and testified that Zhang ChuanDao had come to the Department on the 15th in the name of a graduate of the Central University to visit the Director. Because the Director was in a meeting, he met him on his behalf. Zhang insisted on seeing the Director, and before leaving, he requested to come again at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th. This was only his unilateral request, and he did not agree. Later, he reported to the Director, but the Director did not comment. On the afternoon of the 17th, when Zhang came, he was not in the Department. At about 4:00 PM, when he arrived at the Department, he heard Zhang speaking loudly in front of the reception room, saying, "Secretary Yu made an appointment for me to come, so why won't he see me?" He immediately came out and stated that there was no appointment. Zhang then said many offensive words, such as, "What kind of bureaucratic airs are you putting on as an educational official? If you want to put on airs, why come to Hubei to be an official? If you went to a puppet country to be a traitor, you might even become a minister. In this time of national crisis, you are still putting on bureaucratic airs. What a bastard!" Director Zhou was therefore angry and reported to the Acting Chairman Lu and sent him to the police department. When Zhang was shouting, many officials from the Education Department and the Finance Department came to watch. Witnesses can be summoned for questioning." Next, the witnesses Wu Zhongya, a supervisor of the Education Department, Chen Zihe, a clerk of the Finance Department, and the receptionist of the Education Department, were questioned. Their statements were the same as Yu's statement, but there were slight discrepancies in the time. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer raised four points and asked the court to pay attention to them: ㊀ All citizens are equal under the law. Zhou Tianfang, as a criminal defendant, refused to appear in court, which is a disregard for the dignity of the law and should be arrested and brought to court. ㊁ Except for military police, other officials have no right to arrest criminals. Zhou directly ordered the guards to arrest Zhang, which is a violation of Article 134 of the Criminal Code. ㊂ The times mentioned by the witnesses when Zhang caused trouble in the Education Department are different, which can prove that this did not happen. Zhou fabricated false charges. ㊃ Since the defendant did not appear in court today, he should be summoned again on a fixed date. At this point, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate and set March 1st for the verdict. (28th)</p>

<h3>Where is Our Medical Construction?</h3>
<p>— Hua Xinren</p>
<p>Currently, there is a fashionable ideology in our health circles, shouted out by a group of senior health officials sitting in comfortable offices in tall Western-style buildings, which is the so-called "medical construction." Thinking about it calmly, this is just like "writing proletarian literature while sitting on a sofa," because this is how they want to gain public trust, just like politicians using political tricks to prolong their political lives.</p>
<p>Where is our medical construction? Now I will list the statistics of the United States and China for comparison:</p>
<p>(A) China has a population of 400,000,000, with 7,881 qualified doctors nationwide (referring to those with ministerial licenses). On average, there is one doctor for every 50,000 people. There are 5,000 nurses nationwide, with an average of one nurse for every 80,000 people. There are 50,000 hospital beds nationwide, with an average of one bed for every 10,000 people. The disease rate is 3%.</p>
<p>(B) The United States has a population of 106,775,046, with a total of 140,000 doctors nationwide, averaging one doctor for every 900 people. There are 23,800 nurses nationwide, with an average of one nurse for every 600 people. There are 990,903 hospital beds nationwide, with an average of one bed for every 100 people. The disease rate is 0.15%.</p>
<p>Where is our medical construction? I want to ask our wise authorities, is having only one doctor for every 50,000 people providing healthcare for the people? Is having one hospital bed for every 10,000 people a public medical system? I want to ask, where is our medical construction? The average annual death toll in our country is six million, and the number of deaths due to injustice is also six million (referring to those who do not have access to medical care). The annual economic loss due to excess deaths exceeds 300 million yuan. If this funding were used for construction, we could complete 1,000 universities, 100,000 elementary schools, 5,000 hospitals, 600 waterworks, 100,000 miles of roads, 20,000 airplanes, 30,000 miles of railways, and 800 factories. Looking at the average life expectancy of our people, they can only live to 30 years old, and can only serve in society for 15 years. Looking at these statistical figures, it's probably a bit "shocking," right? What do we urgently need now? Of course, it is "medical construction."</p>
<p>Under the slogan of medical construction, the first step is to increase the number of medical personnel. We want to reduce the mortality rate, improve people's health, and not flaunt new ideologies and shout nice-sounding slogans that can be accomplished, but rather prove the facts with practical methods. Therefore, I say that it is not easy for these specially appointed and simplified health officials to complete this work. Furthermore, "dying of illness" is the most unfortunate thing in the world. Imagine, with only one doctor for every 50,000 people, what do we do when we get sick? In addition, we can see so many patients in the outpatient departments of every hospital, truly as crowded as the road on Shanyin. How eagerly they are seeking a glance from the doctor! Of course, the rich and important people can hire a personal doctor as their exclusive physician when they are sick, or even find a foreign doctor for examination, or even go abroad for treatment. But what about the other poor people? Therefore, to revive the nation and strengthen national power, medical construction is urgently needed. The medical specialist examination held by the Ministry of Health this time, in principle, we feel is suitable for application under the conditions of medical construction, but in terms of method, we have a few points to raise for discussion:</p>
<p>(1) What are the conditions and standards for the selection of members of the Physician Appraisal Committee?</p>
<p>(2) What is the meaning of this appraisal? Is it for the health of the people? Is it for medical construction? Is it to perfunctorily meet the demands of general public opinion?</p>
<p>(3) Is the provision in Article 5, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the appraisal method legal?</p>
<p>(4) Since you are going to conduct a physician examination, why exempt half or all of them? Isn't this an internal contradiction? Why isn't the fee for those who fail refunded?</p>
<p>Physician is a noble and sacred free profession, and it also holds the power of life and death in the world. The government should conduct a thorough reorganization of this. We know that the flexible certification method of the eighteenth year and this year's appraisal method can be said to be a stain on our history, and can also represent the failure of our past education.</p>
<p>"Incompetent doctors kill people" should naturally be banned. We also do not want a few bad apples to damage the reputation of the entire medical community by being called incompetent doctors. However, let us think about how these so-called incompetent doctors came into being. Therefore, the meaning of the government holding this appraisal, I think, is naturally nothing more than wanting to adjust the current social medical system, but we hope that in the adjustment, do not forget the objective environment and conditions! Otherwise, it will once again lead to wasting money and manpower.</p>
<p>Medical construction is not a slogan, but a practical task. How many poor and sick compatriots are waiting for us to do the work we should do, how great is the responsibility we should bear on our shoulders, but currently some senior health officials are too unaware of their position and the responsibility they should bear.</p>
<p>In the past, there were many errors in the path taken by the social medical system. The leaders of health work only aimed at seeking personal and their own faction's way out, forgetting to seek health for the majority of poor and sick people. Therefore, medical construction is a slogan, and the public feels discouraged and disappointed. If the health sector's vision does not pay attention to the grassroots work of society and the health of the general public in the future, I dare say that China's medical construction movement cannot be said to be successful! The medical construction undertaking is not a slogan, but a very arduous task. Now the time to success is still so far away. If we do it bit by bit, if we take the health and welfare of the public as the starting point, and if it is not a slogan, I firmly believe that success is inevitable.</p>
<h3>Developing Medicine and Pharmacy to Make Chinese People Recognize New Medicine (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xia Chengdao</p>
<p>The old doctors say "Western medicine is good at surgery, and Chinese medicine is good at internal medicine," which is even more nonsense. Surgical diseases, in addition to systemic symptoms (such as fever, headache, dizziness, etc.), must have one place where there is redness and swelling, or erosion, or suppuration and bleeding, or deformation and muscle damage. The new medicine calls this local symptoms. The same is true for internal medicine, there must also be one place where there is suppuration and bleeding, or deformation and muscle damage, and then systemic diseases will arise accordingly. Among all diseases, brain hemorrhage, chest and kidney pain have ulcers, liver cirrhosis must have hydrops, heart valve defects cause edema, cavities in tuberculosis lungs are often like rock crevices, and typhoid intestinal ulcers may even rupture. What is presented externally must be what changes internally. This is verified by pathological anatomy and tested on thousands of people, and there is nothing wrong with it. From this point of view, the symptoms of internal and surgical diseases are the same. The only difference is that those inside are difficult to see, and the old doctors deceive themselves and others, and use words like liver hyperactivity, yin deficiency, phlegm accumulation, and rheumatism to muddle through. Those on the outside are visible to everyone, and the old doctors cannot deceive people with muddling through, and they do not understand surgery, so they say "this disease belongs to surgery, which is not their forte." Then, doesn't the new medicine excel only in surgery? Even internal medicine, dermatology, venereology, gynecology, obstetrics, pediatrics, ophthalmology, dentistry, otolaryngology, etc., each has its own special equipment, each has specialized doctors, and each department is the forte of new medicine. However, some unofficial doctors who were born as nurses in missionary hospitals only understand a few Western medicines, just like old doctors know the uses of Chinese medicine, suffering from the same problem of knowing what it is but not knowing why it is. For example, Christians scold those who worship ghosts and gods as superstitious, but aren't Christians also superstitious in worshiping Jesus God? Using superstition to scold superstition is really like a fox laughing at a cat!</p>
<p>Old doctors have never studied botany, zoology, physics, chemistry, physiology, etc. They do not understand the functions of various human organs, do not know the structure and properties of daily food, so they forbid patients from eating meat, and even the world-recognized nourishing foods for patients, such as eggs and milk, are not allowed to be eaten. Instead, they order patients to eat radishes, pickled mustard greens, and other indigestible things. Patients already have a poor appetite, and eating these things cannot improve their appetite. The more they eat, the less they can swallow at three meals. If they are bedridden for a long time, due to lack of nourishing plants, the body becomes emaciated. Not only can the physical strength and spirit consumed during the illness not be quickly restored, but many are also equivalent to starving to death. The old doctors' lack of reason and harming patients can be said to be extreme. New medicine has special nutritional therapies for patients' diets, which also occupy a very important part of the treatment. It has thorough theories, rich practical experience, specially made nourishing foods, and special equipment, all to help patients quickly restore their healthy physical strength and spirit. Generally, fresh foods that are rich in nutrients and easy to digest are suitable for patients' health preservation, but there are also exceptions, such as people with diabetes cannot eat sugar, and people with mental illness cannot eat stimulating things, etc. The old doctors often order patients to eat vegetarian food, saying that meat produces wind, dampness, phlegm, etc., which is as absurd and nonsensical as delirium!</p>
<p>What is even more painful is that the general villagers say that Chinese medicine says "After eating Western medicine, Chinese medicine will be ineffective in the future," so that the general ignorant people regard Western medicine as taking poison and dare not try it. Both Chinese and Western medicines come from animal, plant, and mineral sources, and there is only a distinction between refined and crude. How could such a strange thing happen? Perhaps they can blame the new medicine when Chinese medicine is ineffective in the future and muddle through their responsibility! Even the educated class in the countryside cannot avoid this, deeply poisoned by the old doctors. It can be seen that the old doctors try to confuse the public, reverse right and wrong, prevent the development of new medicine, prevent it from occupying their territory, and rob them of their rice bowls. Their intentions can be said to be meticulous! These old doctors are just like those blind fortune tellers who have lost their conscience and say that fortunes can not be told, fate cannot be calculated, but food cannot not be eaten. What difference is there? However, this is a social and livelihood problem that should be remedied and resolved by the state. It must not hinder the progress of the country and harm the lives of most people in order to preserve the rice bowls of a few people.</p>
<p>Chinese people must recognize and distinguish right from wrong. We are not as despicable as the old doctors, opposing the old doctors in order to rob them of their rice bowls. Our starting point is world science, and our work is to correct the erroneous theories of the old doctors. Our goal is to promote national progress, seek the happiness of the people's livelihood, and protect the safety and health of people's lives!</p>
<p>However, there are some selfish and profit-seeking merchants who promote the old doctors in the name of promotion and oppose the new doctors. Where have they ever opened their eyes and seen that Korean ginseng, etc., are also transported into our country's gates by foreign freighters?</p>
<p>Finally, developing medicine and pharmacy requires studying domestic drugs, refining them with scientific methods, and using them for treatment. Developing national essence, contributing to the world, and showing the glory of the country require the government to exert efforts to promote science, revitalize industry, open factories, and hire experts in various fields and subjects at home and abroad to preside over it. Manufacturing medical supplies and equipment ourselves to meet the needs of the people is the fundamental way to stop leaks!</p>

<h3>Preconditions for Promoting Rural Health Undertakings</h3>
<p>— Yi Dan</p>
<p>Before we talk about the various issues of rural health, it is best to first understand the relationship between public health and the revival of the country and nation, and then talk about the importance of the status of rural health administrative measures and how to promote them smoothly in the future?</p>
<p>I remember that Japanese health professor Dr. Tsunekawa once said: "The prosperity, strength, and constancy of a nation depend on the quality of public health." Indeed, everyone knows this, everyone can say it, and in fact it is inevitable. According to Swedish statistician Sundbärg: "The death rate is the best method to measure the degree of civilization and effectiveness: If we compare the records of death rates in two countries or two places over many years, we can immediately judge the degree of their civilization development." Originally, the length of life increases with the progress of hygiene science and preventive medicine. Let's examine the supporting facts: According to recent surveys, the average life expectancy of Indians is 25 years, the average for people in Massachusetts, USA is 45 years, and the average for Swedes is 50 years. As for whether the health undertakings in these three countries are developed or not? The difference in the level of reality shown by their life extension rate and the level of health undertakings can be silently known. Furthermore, it can be seen that the length of life is always controlled by the artificial power of public health. On the other hand, the purpose of public health is to protect the health of the national physique and serve as the basis for spiritual and material development. Because only with a healthy people can a healthy society be formed, and only with a healthy society can a healthy country be formed; there has never been a nation that is weak and a society that is morbid that can establish a magnificent country in the world!</p>
<p>According to the above points, the importance of public health has been frankly displayed. Therefore, the implementation of public health occupies an important position of factual urgency in any country. However, the implementation of public health in our country is especially important because our country is based on agriculture, and the rural population accounts for more than 85% of the total population of the country: The unhealthiness of farmers is therefore the unhealthiness of the entire nation, and the unhealthiness of the nation is the key to the survival of the country, to put it bluntly, it is a precursor to the destruction of the country and the nation, so although public health is important, rural public health is even more important.</p>
<p>But what about our country now? The entire countryside can be said to be in ruins. The lives of farmers are ravaged by natural disasters and man-made disasters every day. Now they are almost on the last road to death, and the rural problem has also evolved into an extremely serious problem. Under this circumstance, we can often hear a very modern slogan—Go to the countryside and revive the countryside. At the same time, our government also has the organization of the Rural Revival Committee specializing in this matter, and its eyes are also cast on the countryside in terms of health improvement and facilities. As for its achievements, there are facts, and it is not within the scope of this article. Of course, the above is the fact that has clearly told us that China's current rural health occupies great importance, which is to say: Promoting rural health is tantamount to saving the life of China, which is on its last breath. Because the public deeply knows that rural health is important in China and is a reviving medicine for China: Therefore, those who bear the mission of promoting rural health are working hard and are also looking forward to reaching the so-called ideological destination—a rural area that can evolve with the trend of the times—however, under the circumstances of this nascent undertaking, we want to ensure that there are no obstacles in the process of promoting rural health and that we can realize our hopes. From a personal perspective, we should at least solve the following problems:</p>
<p>(1) Engage in active publicity</p>
<p>We know that if we want to implement the various hygiene methods that we consider necessary to implement for farmers, and also make them happy to follow them: This work is indeed not an easy task! First, farmers have immature knowledge: Second, the shadow of superstition is deeply rooted in their minds. With these two factors, farmers have absolutely no possibility of accepting health knowledge. Then, since there is no health knowledge, of course, they cannot understand the good or bad of hygiene and new medicine. Of course, they do not know how to improve the places that hinder hygiene. Therefore, the mutual invasion of diseases is naturally an unavoidable thing. But at the same time, they have to seek survival and have to make another attempt, so they still follow the remaining poison of superstition to do some self-destructive things such as alchemy, swallowing talismans, seeking gods, and worshiping Buddha. But occasionally they will respond to their demands—this demand is not really a gift from the gods, but actually the secret blessing of the natural resistance in their body, but there is no way to be aware of it!—This cannot but be said to be a kind of invisible mental and psychological treatment. Of course, the reason for their belief is based on the effect of this point. In fact, it is precisely the factor that causes their failure, because they never have the instinct to improve, and only hold on to the little grace obtained by superstitious luck, which is definitely not enough to guarantee life. However, people are ultimately rational, and besides, their only goal is still to seek the same line of survival! Therefore, if we want to make today's farmers in our country know the true essence of hygiene, we must at least make them know where the benefits and harms lie, and even more know the skin-cutting relationship between quack doctors, superstitious traditional concepts, etc. that kill people without using knives. This has to take some effort to move their tongues and engage in active hygiene publicity.</p>
<p>(2) Must cooperate with local gentry</p>
<p>If we run to a remote rural area where people are unfamiliar, it is absolutely not easy to see the corresponding situation and effect when we speak. Because in such places, all the farmers do not know us, so they cannot know whether we are good people or bad people. Therefore, no matter how much we make the hygiene methods that should be given to them sound flowery, or shout until our throats are hoarse, in the end no one will pay attention to you, and they may even suspect that we are the ghosts who are trying to harm them. To avoid this malpractice, the only way is to contact the local gentry, cooperate with them, join hands, and jointly seek promotion, which can have significant results. Because they are like the leaders there, the masses of farmers believe in them and obey them. They can intervene in the major and minor events that occur in the rural area, and they can influence the masses of farmers. Therefore, we should adopt this approach, try to cooperate with the local gentry, so that they can follow us. Once this step is put into practice, it is no different from the masses of farmers following us. In this way, we can save a lot of trouble, and we can obtain satisfactory results in simplicity. At the same time, our work should be integrated with the farmers. Then, implementing cooperation with the local gentry is the advanced manifestation of forming a united front with the farmers.

<h3>Common Sense of Hygiene for Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(119) What is Glaucoma?</p>
<p>Our eyeballs can maintain a certain tension and hardness, which is caused by the elasticity of the eyeball wall and the pressure of the fluid in the eyeball cavity. This situation is medically called intraocular pressure. If the intraocular pressure suddenly experiences pathological hyperactivity, the disease will immediately appear. The pupil will also appear slightly green, and the eyeball will become as hard as a stone. If intraocular pressure hyperactivity persists for a long time, it can cause atrophy of important organs and tissues in the eye, leading to blindness. This eye disease is specifically called glaucoma. It has also been recorded in Chinese medicine ophthalmology books for a long time. The so-called thunder headache, lateral headache, five-wind change, green wind, black wind, green wind, and black wind, etc., generally refer to glaucoma. Glaucoma has primary and secondary categories. Primary glaucoma refers to diseases that occur without other eye diseases. Secondary glaucoma is caused by iritis or other eye diseases. Primary glaucoma can be further divided into two categories. Those with eye redness, headache, and other stimulating symptoms are called inflammatory glaucoma. Those without stimulating symptoms are called simple glaucoma.</p>
<p>Here, I plan to briefly describe inflammatory glaucoma.</p>
<p>Inflammatory glaucoma has acute and chronic distinctions due to the speed of its progression. Its cause is still unknown. It mostly occurs in elderly people over 40 years old. It is especially prone to occur in those who are neurotic and mentally overworked. Its progression can be roughly divided into four stages, namely:</p>
<p>(1) Prodromal stage—the patient feels blurred vision. When looking at lights at night, colorful halos often appear around them. Swelling and diffuse cloudiness occur on the surface of the cornea. The pupil is slightly dilated and reacts slowly. Intraocular pressure rises. These symptoms can disappear after a few hours and return to normal. However, it recurs after a few days. After repeated attacks like this, it enters the outbreak stage.</p>
<p>(2) Outbreak stage glaucoma—the patient complains of severe headaches and feels loss of appetite, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, etc. Vision is also highly reduced. The cornea is swollen and cloudy. The eyelids are also swollen, the pupils are dilated, and the reaction disappears. Intraocular pressure is very high, so that the eyeball is as hard as a stone, which can be felt from the outside of the eyelid. The pupil appears green, so this disease is specifically called glaucoma. Sometimes the symptoms of this disease are severe, and blindness can occur soon, which is called electric shock glaucoma.</p>
<p>(3) Complete glaucoma—various organs in the eye are completely degenerated and atrophied. At this time, most patients are blind. The cornea is diffusely cloudy. The iris is atrophied and discolored. The pupils are dilated and the reaction disappears. Intraocular pressure is particularly increased. When examining the fundus of the eye, optic disc cupping can often be observed.</p>
<p>(4) Degenerative glaucoma—is the final stage of glaucoma. Corneal sensation is lost. Large bullous keratitis or band-shaped opacity occurs. The iris is atrophied. Eye pain and headache. As a result, the eyeball also comes to atrophy. Intraocular pressure is also reduced.</p>
<p>The symptoms of glaucoma are so complicated, and its danger is so obvious, so we must not underestimate this disease. If you encounter vision impairment, dilated pupils (except when using mydriatic drugs), increased intraocular pressure, and headaches, you should immediately visit a specialist doctor, which is the best policy.</p>
<p>(120) Optic Neuritis</p>
<p>There are many causes of optic neuritis, such as (1) syphilis, (2) acute infectious diseases (most commonly colds), (3) nephritis, (4) tuberculosis, (5) lead poisoning, (6) meningitis, and (7) trauma, etc. The disease often occurs in conjunction with retinitis, which is called optic neuroretinitis. The subjective symptoms of patients with this disease are decreased vision and narrowed visual field. If a fundus examination is performed, the optic disc papilla is seen to be red and raised. Its boundaries are also unclear. The veins of the retina are often dilated, and the arteries are thin.</p>
<p>The prognosis of optic neuritis is often good, but sometimes it can also lead to optic atrophy. The treatment plan should first explore the cause of the disease and add treatment, which is essential.</p>

<h3>Relief for Declining Fisheries: Fishery Syndicate Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Qian Xinzh reports, Vice Minister Zhou delivers instructions,</p>
<p>Election of Standing Directors and Manager</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industries' Fishery Syndicate was established yesterday. The office is located on the fourth floor of the Xinhua Bank on Jiangxi Road. The national flag and the Kuomintang flag are prominently displayed at the entrance. The first board meeting of the syndicate was held at 11:00 AM. All directors attended. Zhou Yichun, the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Industries, attended and gave instructions. Standing directors were elected and various regulations were passed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Directors Attending</p>
<p>All nineteen directors of the syndicate were present, including official directors Yu Zhenyong, Qian Xinzhi, Gui Yanfang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Yuanshan, Zhang Yichou; directors representing various banks Cheng Muhao, Cao Jiru, Dong Chengdao, Sun Renjing, Zhou Desun, Yang Peiyuan, Wang Shaoxian, Chen Chuanghan, Xu Maotang, Ye Fuxiao, Wang Zhidi, Jin Shangqi; and Zhou Yichun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industries; Supervisor Yan Shenyu, etc. Qian Xinzhi was publicly elected as chairman, Hua Wenyu as recorder. The meeting agenda: A. Formalities, B. Chairman's opening remarks, C. Minister's address, D. Reporting matters, E. Discussion items.</p>
<p>Chairman Qian's Speech</p>
<p>After the meeting began, Chairman Qian Xinzhi delivered the opening remarks, stating, "The Ministry of Industries' Fishery Syndicate is established today. I am very grateful for the participation of all directors and the guidance of Vice Minister Zhou. Last year, the Ministry of Industries, recognizing the decline of our country's fisheries, felt the necessity for relief. Therefore, it united with the banking sector to organize the syndicate, to handle loans. The ministry allocated 200,000 yuan, and various banks subscribed 800,000 yuan. A preparatory office was established to carry out the organization. Today it is established, which will provide significant convenience to fishermen. However, there are no sound organizations in fishing villages, so the loan targets are difficult to determine. After investigation by the preparatory office, the situation in various places has been clarified. In the future, we can assist fishermen in various places to establish cooperatives to facilitate loans. The preparatory office has a simple organization, saves expenses, and the Xinhua Bank has also provided a lot of assistance. I hereby submit this report and express my gratitude."</p>
<p>Vice Minister Zhou's Instructions</p>
<p>Vice Minister Zhou Yichun delivered instructions, saying, "On behalf of Minister Wu, I participate in this grand gathering, and would like to report two points: ① In the past, the general society was very unfamiliar with rural areas. Since the financial sector went to investigate, it has gradually gained understanding, and after the pilot rural loans achieved results, the loans have now expanded from small to large, benefiting rural areas greatly. In the future, the Fishery Syndicate is also expected to make concrete contacts with fishermen, following the precedent of rural loans, gradually expanding loans to become a permanent financial institution to improve the lives of fishermen. ② The syndicate's business must strictly adhere to commercial principles and not hold the idea of relief, so that fishermen and the financial sector establish an equal relationship, and the syndicate serves as a communication mechanism, then the syndicate can be successful."</p>
<p>Preparatory Process</p>
<p>Preparatory member Wang Zhixin reported on the preparatory process, stating, "The syndicate was initiated by the Ministry of Industries and supported by twelve banks including the Bank of China, which jointly organized and established the preparatory office. Five meetings were held successively from November 7th of last year. At the first meeting, each bank's subscription was determined: Bank of China, 120,000 yuan; Bank of Communications, 100,000 yuan; Shanghai, Zhejiang Xingye, Four Banks, Jincheng, Jiaye, Zhongnan, Zhonghui, Dalu, Xinhua, 60,000 yuan each; Siming, 40,000 yuan. As for the syndicate's articles of association, loan regulations, etc., the draft was also passed by various meetings and submitted to the Ministry of Industries for record. The preparatory office also sent personnel to Shengsi, Zhoushan, Sheshan Mouth, etc., for investigation, which has come to an end. Future investigations will continue in various places. Also, Four Banks, Xinhua, Zhonghui, three banks, in order to meet the urgent needs of fishermen, first allocated 120,000 yuan for loans, and now several tens of thousands of yuan have been recovered, which will be transferred to the syndicate for handling. " Finally, the list of directors was read out.</p>

<h3>The First Special District Court Sentences Liu Luyin to be Escorted to Hubei for Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Hubei High Court Sends Personnel by Plane to Shanghai to Pick Up and Escort Him, Liu Requests Bail, Which is Denied by the Judge</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the assassins in the assassination cases of Tang Youren, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Yang Yongtai, Chairman of Hubei Province, confessed that Liu Luyin instigated them, Liu was arrested at 1:30 AM on the 24th of last month. The public has repeatedly reported on this in previous newspapers. The case was opened for trial at 10 AM on the 1st in the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court.

At that time, Judge Feng also stated that the court had received a telegram from Chen Shizeng, the chief prosecutor of the Hubei Higher Court. At the same time, it was heard that the municipal government had also received a telegram. Liu himself and his defense lawyers requested to read the telegram, which stated that Liu was related to the assassination of Yang Yongtai and that the case was serious. It requested that he be transferred back to Hubei for trial. Liu's defense lawyer Shan Yuhua stood up to defend.</p>
<p>Liu States his Case and Requests Bail</p>
<p>At that time, Zhang Fusen, a member of the Hubei Higher Court, carrying official documents, hurried to the court. Judge Feng inquired briefly and then said that if an agency other than the court arrested a criminal, the court would have to investigate the evidence before approving the transfer. Now that the Hubei Higher Court has issued a document requesting the transfer, since both belong to the judicial authorities, as long as the suspect is correctly identified, the case should of course be transferred in accordance with the law. Liu's lawyer requested bail before the transfer. Lawyer Zhan Jifeng said that since there are official documents, everything is legal, and the court should approve the immediate transfer. Liu Luyin then stated to the court that he should be investigated in more detail after his arrest, otherwise his spirit, material wealth, and reputation would be damaged. Moreover, he could not easily escape, and he requested bail before the transfer.</p>
<p>Writes Judgment and Orders Transfer</p>
<p>Subsequently, Liu's representative lawyer made a further statement. Finally, Liu said that if bail was not granted, he would declare that he entrusted his representative lawyer to file an appeal. Judge Feng said that the court could not refuse the transfer and that the appeal could not stop the execution. He immediately wrote the judgment that Liu Luyin would be handed over to the personnel of the Hubei Higher Court to be escorted back to Hubei for trial, and that the Shanghai Municipal Police Department would assist in the escort. He then declared the court adjourned.</p>
<p>Escorted to the Police Station, Soon to be Escorted to Hubei</p>
<p>After the court adjourned, Liu went to the police station lawyer's lounge with his family and defense lawyers and drank a cup of tea. He then took a police patrol car to the Chengdu Road Police Station. The Municipal Police Department also sent personnel to accompany him. After the personnel from the Hubei Higher Court completed the transfer procedures, Liu was escorted to the police station around 12 PM. It is reported that the police station treated Liu very well, and in the afternoon, it was decided to hand him over to the Procuratorate of the Hubei Higher Court for handling.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Document Requesting Transfer</p>
<p>The main points of the official document requesting transfer from the Hubei Higher Court stated that in the case of the assassination of Yang Yongtai, the former Chairman of Hubei Province, the murderers Cheng Xiechao and Gong Baizhou confessed that Liu Luyin instigated them. Liu had organized reactionary groups such as the "Revolutionary Corps" and the "Chinese Youth Special Task Force" and deployed party members in various places to engage in assassination work. Therefore, it requested the transfer of the case for trial.</p>
<h3>Grain Transportation Bureau Announces Drop in Rice Prices in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Due to Minister Kong's Earnest Efforts to Provide Relief, Twelve Market Jin Can Be Purchased per Yuan</p>
<p>The Grain Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance announced yesterday that according to a report from the bureau's investigators stationed in Guangdong, the arrival of rice and grain in Guangzhou has recently been quite abundant, and market prices have fallen sharply. Guangdong-produced Simiao rice is 14 yuan, Qimei is 13.7 to 13.9 yuan, Hunan Zhuzhou oil rice is 11.6 yuan, Hengzhou Pu rice is 10.05 yuan, Wuhu Jiaxing Yu rice is 11.4 yuan, Jiangxi Pu rice is 11 to 12 yuan. According to Zheng Baozhao, director of the bureau, Guangzhou's rice prices, according to a report from the bureau's investigators stationed in Guangdong, have fallen by an average of 8 jiao to 1 yuan per dan compared to the highest price in mid-January, and are 4 jiao lower than when I left Guangdong last month, which is also 1 jiao lower than the price of rough rice sold by the Guangdong Provincial People's Food Adjustment Committee. About twelve market jin can be purchased per yuan. Currently, the People's Food Adjustment Committee has more than 200,000 dan of rice in storage, which can be released for sale at any time to suppress the rising market prices. Therefore, the central government and Minister Kong's concern for relief has alleviated the panic and greatly inspired the people of Guangdong.</p>

<h3>Four Guangdong Associations in Shanghai Hosted a Banquet for Yu Hanmou and Others Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 300 Attendees; Very Lively at the New Asia Hotel</p>
<p>The Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, Guangzhao Guild Hall, Cantonese Overseas Chinese Business Federation, and Chaozhou Guild Hall, four organizations, held a banquet at the grand ballroom of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road at 6:00 PM yesterday (1st) to welcome Yu Hanmou and other Cantonese members of the Central Committee. Attendees included Yu Hanmou, Li Xuhuan, Liu Weichi, Deng Gang, Yu Junxian, Wu Tiecheng, Tang Haian, Wen Zongyao, Cai Jinjun, Li Dachao, and others, totaling over 300 people. First, Chairman Wen Zongyao delivered a welcome speech, roughly stating that today, the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, Guangzhao Guild Hall, Chaozhou Guild Hall, and Cantonese Overseas Chinese Business Federation, four organizations, as well as fellow villagers in the city of Shanghai,</p>
<p>Jointly Welcome</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Woqi, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army and Director of the Guangdong Pacification Headquarters, as well as the esteemed members of the Central Committee from our hometown. We are honored that you have deigned to attend. Fellow countrymen have long been away from home, and the longer we are away, the stronger our love for our hometown becomes. Commander-in-Chief Yu, as a Cantonese, bears the responsibility of the highest leader of our Guangdong. His contributions to the military and political facilities of Guangdong Province are obvious to all. The esteemed members of the Central Committee are all pillars of our country and accomplished fellow countrymen, whom we all admire. Taking advantage of your attendance at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee,</p>
<p>Passing Through Shanghai</p>
<p>We have gathered this meeting to sincerely express our welcome. Although the arrangements and format may be simple, the intention is sincere and genuine. On the one hand, we want to fulfill our duty as hosts, on the other hand, to strengthen our connections, and on the other hand, to admire your demeanor, and on the other hand, to hope that you can tell us about the recent situation in Guangdong or important party and government news to comfort our fellow countrymen. Zongyao and others, on behalf of our fellow countrymen, raise a glass to Commander-in-Chief Yu, the esteemed members of the Central Committee, and all the gentlemen, wishing you health and inviting you to drink together. Then, Commander-in-Chief Yu gave a speech, roughly saying that he was very happy to be able to gather with fellow countrymen tonight, drinking and talking. Guangdong has been in a</p>
<p>Special Situation</p>
<p>For several years. The outside world is inevitably isolated. But since July of last year, this situation has been completely eliminated. Regarding the recent situation in Guangdong, I will take this opportunity to give a brief report to my fellow countrymen. First, in the political aspect, Guangdong has now implemented military-civilian separation, and local security is also becoming increasingly peaceful. Those of us responsible for military and political affairs will continue to move forward with a spirit of impartiality and the common goal of not competing with the people for profit. Second, in terms of construction, all construction in Guangdong is still far from meeting the conditions of a model province. One reason is the lack of manpower and financial resources, and the other is the various impacts of the global recession, which has led to the decline of industry and commerce and the gradual depression of rural areas. If we want to make Guangdong a model province, it is essential to have a large amount of</p>
<p>Manpower and Financial Resources</p>
<p>Cannot be helped. Taking food alone, in the past, the measurement of Guangdong rice was affected by political factors, and there was almost no profit to be made from planting by the people. Barren fields were all over the province, and Guangdong's reliance on foreign rice increased day by day, while Guangdong's finances flowed outward day by day. Now, the grain problem is difficult to get help from the central government, but this is a stopgap measure. The fundamental solution is to continue to work towards self-sufficiency in order to solve it thoroughly. All other construction is</p>
<p>Being Planned</p>
<p>In the process, I hope that my fellow countrymen will fulfill a responsibility for their hometown and an obligation for the country, and give timely guidance and assistance to the local authorities of this province. Tonight, with this glass of wine, I wish all my fellow countrymen good health. Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech, roughly saying that during the tense situation in Guangdong and Guangxi in July last year, the whole country was anxious, but thanks to Mr. Yu Woqi upholding justice, the crisis was turned into safety and the danger was turned into ease, and the national peace and unity was completed. As for the problems urgently to be solved in Guangdong, the first is the grain problem. Guangdong's grain has always relied on the supply of Annam and Siam, and every year</p>
<p>Financial Outflow</p>
<p>Amounts to 70 to 80 million yuan, so the food problem cannot be solved, and all problems in Guangdong cannot be solved. He said that this problem cannot be solved in a short period of time or by the efforts of a few people. It must be done with the cooperation of the whole province and the central government. The second is the financial problem. In the past, one yuan of Guangdong currency could be exchanged for one yuan and two jiao of silver dollars. Now, due to the depreciation of Guangdong currency, one yuan and five jiao of Guangdong currency can only be exchanged for one yuan of silver dollars. Guangdong is a province with an excess of imports, and the daily necessities of 30 million Cantonese people depend on foreign supply, so prices have risen and people's lives are becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the problem of currency value is also an urgent problem to be solved. If the above two questions can be</p>
<p>Solved</p>
<p>Then it is possible to build a new Guangdong. We believe that the current local authorities of Guangdong Province will certainly work hard to seek happiness for their hometown and welfare for the country. As for the public welfare undertakings of Cantonese people in Shanghai, such as schools and hospitals, we also hope that the local authorities of this province will give encouragement and assistance from time to time. Afterwards, speakers included Director Liu Weichi and others. It was not until after 8 o'clock that everyone dispersed happily. Mayor Wu also scheduled a banquet at the International Hotel at 12:30 noon today to bid farewell to Mr. Yu and introduce him to leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai. Mr. Yu was originally scheduled to return to the south on the Makinlan Presidential ship of the Da Lai Company tomorrow, but because the ship encountered fog on the way, it will not be able to arrive in Shanghai until the 4th and set sail for Hong Kong on the 5th, so Mr. Yu's itinerary will also be delayed.</p>
<h3>The Nanhsing Steamer Encountered a Storm on the Way</h3>
<p>The Propeller Wing Was Knocked Off, and the Oil Tank Was Damaged; Now It Is Going to Xiutu for Repairs Before Continuing Its Voyage</p>
<p>The Nanhsing steamer of the Nanhsing Shipping Company at 26 Yong'an Street, French Concession, which specializes in running the Shanghai to Xinghua Quanzhou route in Fujian, mainly transports goods. This time, it loaded a large batch of groceries from Shanghai and set off for Quanzhou. On the way, the ship encountered a storm on the sea. The turbulent waves hit the hull very badly, causing an extremely dangerous voyage. The engine wing of the stern rudder was actually knocked off by the big waves and sank into the sea. The oil tank of the ship was also broken by the strong wind and waves, and even the deck was damaged. Fortunately, it struggled hard and was able to escape this dangerous situation. However, with the engine wing knocked off, the ship had lost its ability to navigate and could not sail. The damage to the oil tank and other places also urgently needed to be repaired. It was immediately forced to sail to Xiutu to dock, and urgently telegraphed Ningbo, ordering Huichang Machinery Factory to rush to make two copper engine wings for application, and also used cement to fill the damaged parts in order to open to Quanzhou. The situation of the accident has been reported to Shanghai by telegram yesterday. As for the details and the extent of the damage, etc., it is necessary to wait for the ship to come to Shanghai, send a ship surveyor for inspection, and at the same time, the captain will submit a detailed report of the accident before everything can be clearly known.</p>
<h3>Owners of Houses in Areas with Roads Built Across Borders Oppose the Municipal Council's Collection of Donations</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the issue of house donations in areas with roads built across borders, the owners of houses in the area have risen up in opposition due to the forced collection by the Public Concession Municipal Council. However, this matter concerns China's sovereignty, so the reporter has learned about the situation from all parties concerned as follows:</p>
<p>Water and Electricity Issues</p>
<p>The case of the recovery of roads built across borders was repeatedly negotiated by the municipal government of this city and the authorities of the Public Concession, but a thorough solution could not be obtained due to various reasons. The municipal government of this city, considering the matter related to sovereignty, dispatched posts in the area by the municipal police bureau to protect security and maintain order. Regarding the issue of water and electricity supply in the area, a considerable solution has also been reached. In the area along North Sichuan Road with roads built across borders, most of the water and electricity has been supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. In the Hongqiao area, the supply of electricity is handled by the Shanghai West Electricity Company, which was approved by the municipal government to establish. The water supply issue has also been properly resolved by the municipal government.</p>
<p>Tax Payment Situation</p>
<p>According to the above situation, all house donations in the area should be collected by the municipal government of this city. House donations in the North Sichuan Road area have been completely collected by the municipal finance bureau. The municipal finance bureau has also sent personnel to collect house donations in the Hongqiao area. Some of the owners have paid the house donations to the municipal government, but some have not yet paid.</p>
<p>Owner Opposition</p>
<p>This time, the Public Concession intends to collect house donations from the owners in the area with roads built across borders. The owners have risen up in opposition. The municipal government will naturally strive for it. At the same time, it is hoped that the owners in the area with roads built across borders can abide by Chinese laws and regulations and pay the house donations to the tax collection office on their own.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Shantytown Federation Petition for the Speedy Construction of Public Housing</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Should Not Break Its Promise and Set a Deadline for Demolishing Shanties</p>
<p>The Shantytown Federation of this city stated that the Municipal Council limited the demolition of all shantytowns in the areas of Dalian Bay Road, Yulin Road, Qiwupu Road, Pingliang Road, Lan Road, Yangshupu Road, and the intersection of Zhaofeng Road, Dalian Bay Road, and the boundary road of the concession in Pudong before May 1st of this year. This caused panic among the shantytowns in the area. Therefore, Tang Anping, Wang Qitai, Sun Hankui, Xu Xiguang, Wang Xinglin, Duan Yifu, and others were elected as representatives yesterday afternoon to petition the First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Taxpayer Chinese Association, Huadong Yu Qiaqing, and the Municipal Council, etc., to express their grievances and request exemption from demolition, and appealed for the realization of the construction of public housing to avoid homelessness. The association's petition to the Municipal Council is recorded as follows: The petition is for requesting exemption from demolishing shanties to maintain the residence of the poor and avoid homelessness, and to emphasize credit. Since early July of the 25th year of the Republic of China, this association has appealed to all parties to request exemption from demolition. The bureau replied that it would accept the suggestions of the Citizens' Federation, the Taxpayer Association, and the Huadong, and agreed to build public housing to accommodate the shantytowns. This association also voluntarily guaranteed that it would not increase or enlarge, implement chain protection, implement only maintaining existing survival, and gradually implement the reduction plan. It was reported to the bureau for record. In November of the 25th year, Mr. Habert, director of the engineering department, led the representatives of this association to the model room and pointed out the design of public housing. On December 10th, the bureau issued a repair scope letter in view of the misunderstanding in the repair of shantytowns, so as to avoid future disputes. It did not mention other issues. This association knows that the bureau is enthusiastic about society and cares about the suffering of the people. In order to seek joint responsibility, it divides ten households into a group, and ten groups set up a supervisor to supervise on the spot. Recently, 447 groups have been completed, 169 groups are west of Lan Road, and the rest are east of Lan Road. Before the issuance of the repair scope letter, those who reported and forwarded it to the engineering department for approval, a total of 576 households. It has been seven months since now. Not only has the shantytown not been added at all, but on the contrary, the landlords' buildings and other accidents have been demolished by the engineering department by no less than 100 households. The above events are not our exaggeration. I still ask you to inspect it on the spot. The bureau should also maintain the past and wait for the completion of public housing before proceeding is not too late. Recently, the bureau, disregarding the people's difficulties, suddenly issued demolition leaflets west of Lan Road in February of this year, setting a deadline for demolition before May 1st. The east of Lan Road said it would be July 1st. The poor people were panicked when they saw this sudden incident, and before the deadline arrived, the engineering department demolished ten households at the intersection of Jining Road and Qiqihar Road on February 19th. The shantytowns felt even more panicked and helpless. I think the bureau has a decree in front of it and cannot break its promise later. Before public housing has been implemented, it should understand the hardships of the poor. It is impossible to rectify the city appearance and lose credit. Therefore, this association especially begs the bureau to cherish the residence of the poor, withdraw its order, maintain humanity, and avoid the displacement of more than 26,000 people. Then this association is very fortunate, and the shantytowns are very fortunate.</p>
<h3>Wu Ke-ren and Others Pass Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Wu Ke-ren, commander of the 67th Army, and Li Zhentang, Huo Shouyi, Zhou Fucheng, Tang Junyao, division commanders, and Zhang Zhiheng, chief of staff of the 3rd Cavalry Division, and other six people, went to Ningbo on the 26th of last month to visit Mr. Zhang Xueliang to express their condolences. They returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou the day before yesterday, and took the night train to Beijing at 11:00 PM that night to visit Chairman Chiang on the 3rd for instructions. It is reported that during this visit to Ningbo, Mr. Zhang Xueliang repeatedly warned Wu and others to obey the central government.</p>
<h3>Military Delegation to Europe Led by Shangguan Yunxiang to Return</h3>
<p>The Chinese military delegation to Europe, led by Shangguan Yunxiang and others, was dispatched abroad last year to inspect military equipment in various European countries for reference. It has been more than a year since then. It is now learned that Shangguan and others have completed their mission and have returned home on the Conte Verde of the Italian Shipping Company. It is scheduled to go to Guangdong after arriving in Shanghai, and will return to Beijing to report on their mission around the end of the month. Shangguan Yunxiang's wife and others will take a ship south from Shanghai on the 3rd to meet him.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Hosts Banquet for He Jian</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet for Chairman He Jian of Hunan Province, Yin Renxian, the new director of the provincial finance department, Yu Chuanji, director of the construction department, Wang Ping, director of the finance department of Shanxi Province, and Li Hongwen, representative of Yan Xishan, at his private residence on Haig Road at 12:00 noon yesterday. The banquet dispersed at around 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Henan Association in Shanghai Hosts Banquet for Shang Zhen</h3>
<p>Chairman Gao Qiyu of the Henan Provincial Government came to Shanghai to treat his dental disease on the occasion of attending the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and stayed at the New Asia Hotel in this city. The Henan Association in Shanghai believes that since Chairman Shang took office, he has deeply understood the suffering of the people and actively handled the extermination of bandits, the prohibition of drugs, and the construction of education and administration, so that the people can live and work in peace. A banquet was held at the New Asia Hotel yesterday. Those who attended included Zhang Mingqin, a member of the executive supervisory committee of the association, and Guo Fangwu of the Zhenwu Association, and other ten people. Chairman Zhang Mingqin delivered a welcome speech, followed by Chairman Shang's thank you, and reported on the major ends of administration and bandit suppression in Henan in the past year. Guo Fangwu reported on the drought situation in Henan and the teaching and relief matters. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, which was very lively, and the guests and hosts were happy and defeated.</p>
<h3>Chen Ce Seeks Medical Treatment for Leg Ailment</h3>
<p>Chen Ce, member of the Central Committee and commander of the Humen Fortress in Guangdong, went to Beijing a month ago to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and reported on defense to Chairman Chiang. After finishing his work, he came to Shanghai a few days ago to wait for a ship to return to the south. However, Chen's leg ailment has worsened and he has difficulty walking. Therefore, Mayor Wu and Director of the Health Bureau Li Yanan introduced doctors Niu Huisheng, Dong Shouping, Cao Chentao, Li Mingci, and American doctor Ba and German doctor Ba Lanshi to jointly diagnose at Niu's Hospital for fundamental treatment. Once the diagnosis is completed, if doctors permit, it is planned to return to defense with Director Yu Hanmou on the 5th of this month.</p>
<h3>Submarine Cable between Shanghai and Nagasaki Repaired</h3>
<p>The submarine cable between Shanghai and Nagasaki of the Japanese Telegraph Bureau was interrupted for many days due to an obstacle in a certain place outside Wusongkou. It is learned that it was completely repaired at 4:00 PM yesterday and can be reported as usual.</p>

<h3>Robbery of Over 10,000 Gold Yuan at Bank of Communications on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>Guard Shot; Arrest Efforts Very Difficult</p>
<p>At around 11:30 yesterday morning, a robber suddenly came to the Bank of Communications branch at 438 Nanjing Road, Public Concession. He was wearing a Western-style suit and leather shoes, looking very luxurious, and holding a Mauser pistol. He walked in from the side door and went straight to the cashier's counter, where he fired a shot at the ground as a warning. At that time, Xu Futing, the bank's guard from Taixing (57 years old), was sitting idly on the sofa. Before he could resist, the robber fired another shot, hitting him in the right chest. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The robber took the opportunity to jump into the cashier's office, put the 10,000 yuan of national currency that had just been deposited by a certain household into a briefcase, and fled. Afterwards, the bank reported the situation to the Lao Zha Police Station, which sent detectives to pursue the robber. However, the robber had disappeared without a trace. The injured Xu was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries are serious. It is reported that the guard has been working at the bank for ten years. The concession police authorities are now strictly investigating the robber. It is not known whether they will be able to solve the case soon.</p>
<h3>Western Newspapers Report Bandit Attack on Car</h3>
<p>Occurred at 7:30 PM; Location About Three Miles from Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Mainland News, on Sunday night, six Chinese and foreign residents of this city, including Miss Zhang Jingjiang, were returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway by car. At around 7:30 PM, about three miles from Shanghai, they saw three people standing by the road, waving to stop. The driver, Mr. Hu, initially thought they were police officers, so he slowed down. Unexpectedly, before the car came to a complete stop, one of the three suddenly opened fire, shattering the windshield and slightly injuring two female passengers in the face. Seeing that the situation was not good, Mr. Hu quickly accelerated forward. The three opened fire again twice, one of which hit the rear of the car. Fortunately, no one was injured. After arriving in Shanghai, it has been reported to the Chinese authorities and the French police.</p>
<h3>University Student Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Rumored to Be Due to Unrequited Love</p>
<p>He Qihua, a 24-year-old Cantonese female student at Daxia University on Zhongshan Road in Zhabei, for unknown reasons, had the thought of death at around 10:00 AM yesterday. She secretly swallowed a heavy poison. Before long, the poison took effect and could not be controlled. After being discovered, she was hired a car to be sent to Zhongshan Hospital at Fenglin Bridge for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died after 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It was found that the deceased had no family members in Shanghai and studied here alone. This death is rumored to be due to unrequited love.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Missing Male Corpse Have Been Found</h3>
<p>Immediately Open Coffin for Examination</p>
<p>On February 23rd of this year, a male corpse of an old man was suddenly discovered on the Jiangbian River in the West Cannon Terrace of Gaochang Temple. The corpse was about 50 or 60 years old, wearing a blue serge cotton robe, a black satin cotton vest, a black twill cotton coat, black zigong-weave cotton pants, line socks and cotton shoes, line trouser belt, and a monk's head. After the police officer of the West Gate Branch reported, he ordered the five-map local security Gu to report to the land court for inspection. Unexpectedly, the prosecutor went to examine the corpse, but its whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, the police bureau, believing that the local security had neglected his duties, causing the dead person to be missing, arrested Gu Xueyuan and sent him to the land court. He was ordered by the prosecutor to post bail and go out to find the whereabouts of the dead person. Now Gu Xueyuan has found that when the corpse was discovered at the West Gate Branch and reported to the local security for inspection, the corpse was no longer there when the local security went to see it. In fact, after the naval headquarters discovered it nearby, they immediately notified the water patrol team, who instructed the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Nanmatou Teaching Bureau to take the corpse to prepare a coffin for collection and burial in the Bailianjing Yizhong land. Therefore, the local security asked the rescue bureau and then took the corpse out of the coffin and transported it to the rescue bureau. Yesterday afternoon, it was transported to the local security. The local security immediately reported to the land court and was ordered by prosecutor Zhu to wait for the coffin to be opened for examination.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Cohabitation; Landlord Reports to Police</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhaoxian Detained Pending Punishment; Zhang Liumei Handed Over to the Association for Custody</p>
<p>Zhang Liumei, a 16-year-old girl from Qisheng Street, Changyinsha, Tongzhou, was playing at the ferry terminal at noon on February 19th. She was tricked by Chen Zhaoxian, a barber from the same hometown, on the pretext of introducing her to work in a yarn factory. She came to Shanghai by boat and was sexually assaulted in a room at the Yuankang Hotel on Limalu in Nanshi. The next day, he took the girl to the Yangshupu Hejian Road and rented a bungalow from Zhang Guochang, a local. The two looked like a couple. The day before yesterday, Zhang Guochang, believing that the two were not officially married, inquired about the details from the girl and reported the information to the Yangshupu Police Station. The Chinese detective Chen Yonggui, together with the Western detective, went to the address and arrested him, along with the girl Zhang Liumei, and took them to the police station for transfer to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, explained the case and asked for a postponement, stating that the addresses of both men and women were in the mainland and asked for an official letter to be sent to the county for investigation. The girl could only be temporarily sent to the Women and Children Relief Association. According to Zhang Guochang, the second landlord of Hejian Road, Zhang Liumei said that her parents were all dead, and she only had one adoptive father, who was tricked into coming to Shanghai by Chen Zhaoxian at the ferry terminal. In contrast, the defendant's testimony was ambiguous. Magistrate Xiao Bianfen ordered him to be detained again. Zhang Liumei was allowed to be sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for custody and rescheduled for review.</p>
<h3>Further Trial of the Li Guojie Case</h3>

However, Li's lawyer stated that 30,000 yuan of the deposit had already been mortgaged, leaving only 20,000 yuan, and that the Maolu Farm did not belong to him. The court is investigating and has sent a letter to the Jintan County government to verify before further review. The court is scheduled to continue the hearing on the 3rd of this month, i.e., tomorrow at 2 PM.</p>
<h3>Teacher-Student Romance</h3>
<p>Girl Pregnant, Later Arrives in Shanghai, Borrows Money from Relatives, Case Uncovered</p>
<p>Yao Dawen, a girl from Ningbo, Zhejiang province, is currently sixteen years old and was studying at the Peide Elementary School in Cixi, Ningbo. After graduating last year, she was recommended by her Peide homeroom teacher, Zhu Guangtong, a native of Ningbo, to the Ning County Girls' Middle School to continue her studies. Due to their teacher-student relationship, Zhu frequently visited Yao at the Ning County Girls' Middle School. Unexpectedly, over time, the teacher-student relationship transformed into a romance. Like illicit affairs, they became inseparable, and the ill-fated relationship took root early. Yao's abdomen gradually swelled. Fearing that the secret would be discovered by her classmates and teachers, she had to drop out of school first. Not daring to face her elders in Jiangdong, she followed Zhu Guangtong to Shanghai like Hongfu's elopement, renting a house at No. 136 Jingfu Lane, Matteh Hess Road, in western Shanghai, as their cohabitation place. Due to financial difficulties, Yao recently wrote a letter to a relative in Hangzhou, named Jia, requesting a loan. Upon receiving the letter, Jia realized that Yao had eloped and immediately took a train to Shanghai. Together with Yao Dawen's brother, Yao Zishou, they went to the address at 9:30 PM the day before yesterday, found and apprehended Yao Dawen. They then arrested Zhu Guangtong and brought them to the Xinzha Police Station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the 8th Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Station Lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above situation and requested permission to detain Zhu Guangtong for investigation. Judge Huang approved the detention and scheduled another hearing for this Friday.</p>
<h3>Dismembered Body Discovered in Package</h3>
<p>Limbs Cut Off, Corpse Divided into Three Sections, Flesh and Blood Mutilated, Horrifying</p>
<p>At around 3 PM yesterday afternoon, a large package was suddenly discovered on a wasteland near Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, in western Shanghai. Its appearance was strange, and passersby reported it to the local Chinese police. Upon opening the package, they were horrified to find a naked, dismembered corpse. All four limbs had been cut off, and the body was divided into three sections. The flesh and blood were a blur, and it was impossible to tell if it was male or female. The scene was extremely gruesome. The police immediately reported to the police station head, who dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct a detailed investigation. They concluded that it was a case of murder followed by dismemberment and disposal of the body. They immediately sent the body to the coroner's office and reported it to the First Special District Court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Crematorium to Adopt Chinese Architectural Style</h3>
<p>Diesel Fuel to Be Used, Currently in Design Stage, Site in Jiangwan, Budget of 60,000 Yuan, Construction Expected to Be Completed This Spring</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Crematorium was initiated by Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and a preparatory committee was established, the following is a report on the recent progress:</p>
<p>Preparatory Meeting</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Crematorium was initiated by the Municipal Government, Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Ye Yuhu, Guo Chengen, Heber, Wen Zongyao, Zhu Boquan, Jiang Yiping, Li Yuanxin, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Commissioner Wang Changchun, Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, Police Bureau Director Cai Jingjun, Public Works Bureau Director Shen Yi, Health Bureau Director Li Ting'an, and others were appointed to form a preparatory committee. Several preparatory meetings were convened, and the total construction budget was set at 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Budget Allocation</p>
<p>Regarding the allocation of construction funds, a reporter from the Ruentong News Agency learned from the preparatory committee that in addition to 20,000 yuan allocated by the Municipal Government and 10,000 yuan to be raised by Dr. Wu Liande, the remaining 30,000 yuan will be raised by Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, and other committee members from various charitable organizations and public offices that handle burials. The charitable organizations and public offices that donate will enjoy preferential treatment in the future, i.e., they can cremate unclaimed coffins free of charge.</p>
<p>Furnace Design</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has allocated 20 mu of land in Jiangwan for the crematorium site. The architectural style of the crematorium will adopt the Chinese architectural style. As for fuel, using gas would be too expensive and would violate the principle of economic efficiency. Therefore, diesel fuel was chosen. The furnace design is currently being designed by a German engineer. It is expected that three corpses can be cremated simultaneously in the furnace. The cost of diesel fuel required will only be 80 cents in national currency, and the cost per corpse will be less than 30 cents.</p>
<p>Completion This Spring</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted by the Municipal Health Bureau in 1929, there are as many as 100,000 floating coffins in Shanghai. The population of this city is extremely dense, and many good lands are occupied by these floating coffins. Therefore, it is extremely detrimental to society, economy, public health, and the appearance of the city. Therefore, the urgent need for cremation goes without saying. The preparatory committee is actively proceeding with the project, hoping to complete it this spring.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents to Hold Memorial Service Tomorrow, Jiangwan Road Traffic to Be Cut Off</h3>

<h3>Major Theft Case Uncovered in a Hotel on North Zhejiang Road</h3>
<p>Five Men and Women Arrested, Woman Violated by Thief, Six Suitcases and Many Items of Clothing Seized</p>
<p>On the evening of the 23rd of last month, a major theft occurred at the Baokang Pawnshop on Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei. The thief entered through a hole in the back of the pawnshop and stole a large number of clothes and other items, worth approximately several thousand yuan. The case was reported to the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Xinzha Police Sub-bureau. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, Wu Zhongda, a detective from the 6th Division of the Municipal Police Bureau's Investigation Squad, received a tip that</p>
<p>Accomplices of the Thief</p>
<p>Were hiding in room 44 on the 3rd floor of the Guang'an Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. The officer immediately reported to Captain Qian Daxiong, who led a team of detectives to make the arrests. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at room 44 on the 3rd floor of the Guang'an Hotel, the thief and a woman were sleeping, both naked. They were ordered to get dressed and five suitcases were seized. A man named Li Asan, 29 years old, from Changzhou, and a man named Zhang Daosheng, 30 years old,</p>
<p>Also from Changzhou</p>
<p>And a woman named Wu Lushi, 29 years old, from Dantu, were taken into custody. They confessed that there were other accomplices hiding in Xieqiao, Nanshi, and Chaomibang, Zhabei. So, they split up and arrested Wang Arer in Yuanjili No. 14, Weiwu Road, Xieqiao, and seized a suitcase. They arrested Zhang Shengyi in a tile flat in Chaomibang, Zhabei. After being taken into custody, Wang Arer (i.e., Wang Hongsheng), 37 years old, from Tongzhou, and Zhang Shengyi, 36 years old, from Zhenjiang, confessed. Upon inspecting the items in the boxes, there were dozens of items, which were all</p>
<p>Sealed by Captain Qian</p>
<p>The remaining items were pawned in various places. Hundreds of pawn tickets were found. The staff of the Baokang Pawnshop were summoned to the team to identify some of the stolen goods. The woman, Wu Lushi, claimed that she arrived in Shanghai on a fourth-class train from Danyang the day before. Since her husband passed away last August and she couldn't make a living, she came to Shanghai to find a younger sister to help her work. So, she took a note and asked Li Asan for information. He told her to</p>
<p>Go to the Hotel</p>
<p>Saying he would find her work. Unexpectedly, she was deceived and lost her virginity for two nights. She said, "A white cloth bag is mine, containing two short shirts, one lined cheongsam, one blue cloth coat, one red shirt, one headscarf shirt, one white poplin pants, one broadcloth pants, one wool twill pants, one pair of black and white flower shoes, one pair of socks, one pillow, and one blanket, etc." The team confirmed that this was true. However, they must wait to be sent to the Third Section of the Police Headquarters before they can request a return. The remaining criminals are currently being interrogated.</p>

It is heard that all attendees signed up to initiate the preliminary discussion and set up a preparatory office to facilitate the process.</p>

<h3>Daughter-in-Law Accuses Father-in-Law of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Mother's Family Ancestral Land, Father-in-Law Schemes to Transfer Ownership and Take It for Himself</p>
<p>Huang Changlin, a local resident of No. 253 Yangjiadu, Pudong, whose original home is in Liuhe, so he is also known as Liuhe Arer, is 64 years old this year. He was originally of humble origin, working as a boatman. Later, he suddenly had an opportunity and became a boat charterer running the docks. He has owned many large barges. More than ten years ago, he made a lot of money and was frugal. Therefore, he now has more than 100,000 assets and is one of the richest people in the rural area of Yangjiadu. The villagers elected him as</p>
<p>The local head of the village has become an old master. It is a pity that the younger generation cannot carry on the family business, which is a regret. Huang Changlin was once accused of abandonment by a woman several years ago and was involved in litigation all the way to the High Court before being declared innocent and settling with the woman. Therefore, in recent years, Huang has not been as actively involved in external affairs as before. Unexpectedly, recently his eldest daughter-in-law, Huang Shao (30 years old, has filed a criminal appeal in the local court against Huang Changlin for embezzling real estate. According to the main point of the complaint filed by her lawyer Liu Liang, the plaintiff has</p>
<p>Ancestral Land of Her Mother's Family, Located in Pudong 23rd District, 24th Bao, with a total area of 2 mu, 8 fen, 6 li, and 5 hao, the actual amount after assessment is 4 mu, in the name of Ding Shao. Because the plaintiff was a child bride at the age of six and married at the age of seventeen, the land deed has been kept with the father-in-law. Unexpectedly, the defendant has insidious intentions and intends to illegally own the property he holds for others. He secretly went to the Land Bureau to secretly transfer the ownership. Later, the plaintiff found out and demanded it back. The defendant, seeing that the plaintiff was a woman who could be deceived, ignored her and went to the Land Bureau to collect a new deed, thinking it would erase the facts. However, the Land Bureau also discovered</p>
<p>The Collusion and Fraud and temporarily suspended the issuance. Therefore, it is requested that Huang Changlin be punished for the crime of intending to illegally own property held by him for others, for himself or for a third party, in accordance with Article 335 of the Criminal Law, which is punishable by imprisonment of not more than five years, detention, or a fine of not more than 1,000 yuan. Huang Changlin also hired Senior Lawyer Xue Lisheng to defend him and file a counterclaim for false accusation. The main point is that the plaintiff is the wife of the eldest son, Jinfu. There are often disputes between the husband and wife. The parents-in-law are not in their eyes. They do not know how to follow morality, and also</p>
<p>Disregard Rank and Seniority. Abandoning the labor of women's work, they violate the responsibility of being a good wife, listening to slander and coming home to threaten. Since 1926, they have repeatedly been involved in litigation in civil and criminal courts and the prosecutor's office with her son Jinfu, more than five times, and have repeatedly lost the lawsuits. Therefore, she has unrealistic ideas and falsely accuses the father-in-law of embezzling real estate. However, her purpose is still to ask for a divorce from her son. This is completely fabricated out of thin air. Even if there is this land, there is a statute of limitations, and it cannot be requested back in civil law. Criminal Procedure Law 313</p>
<p>Direct Lineage, Ascendants</p>
<p>Or spouse, shall not bring a private prosecution. Therefore, it is requested that the case be dismissed and the crime of false accusation be punished. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing opened the court. Regarding the relationship between father-in-law and daughter-in-law, it is a direct lineage relative. The defendant's lawyer said that the direct case was a mistake, so the trial continued. The plaintiff's statement was roughly the same as the complaint, while the defendant Huang Changlin said that the land was bought from the Ding family. The official asked in whose name the account was at the Land Bureau. Huang said that Ding Jinfu came forward. The official said,</p>
<p>"Since you bought it, why didn't you use the Huang surname?" Huang replied that it would save a transfer fee, but when the four sons in the family are to divide the property in the future, they would change it back. The official said, "So, the fee will still be needed." The official also asked about Huang Changlin's family situation. Huang was unusually distressed and poor, claiming that he was not rich and only had a broken house to feed himself. The official then ordered Huang Changlin to pay a deposit of 2,000 yuan and to submit all the documents in his home for investigation. Because he did not have time to find a guarantor, lawyer Xue requested that he be released on bail first, and the bail bond would be added the next day.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests Amendments</h3>
<p>First Category of Income Tax: Draft Collection Guidelines</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce continues to write to the Income Tax Office, requesting amendments to the draft collection guidelines for the third category [of income]. The letter states: "Respectfully, concerning the draft collection guidelines for income tax, regarding the first category, profit-seeking income, and the second category, salaries and compensation, the various items that should be modified, added, or deleted have already been detailed and communicated to your office by our chamber, requesting their adoption. Now, regarding the draft collection guidelines for the third category of income tax, we have continued our discussions and believe that there are also areas that should be modified, added, or deleted. We have compiled these opinions on a separate sheet and respectfully submit them to you, hoping that you will review and approve their adoption. Attached are the proposed modifications: ㊀ In the original draft, Article 3, Section 2, concerning interest from loans made by foreign firms, organizations, and individuals in the banking industry to companies and businesses, we propose to amend it to 'interest received by companies, businesses, firms, and factories on stored funds.' (Because the third category is originally for income from securities and deposits, the original draft's use of 'loans made' is fundamentally inconsistent with the regulations.) ㊁ In the original draft, Article 4, 'Loans from banks and money houses, and interbank or inter-branch transactions in the banking industry, the interest generated therefrom shall be included in the calculation of business income and shall not be subject to deposit interest income tax,' we propose to amend it to 'interest generated from loans made by banks and money houses shall be included in the calculation of business income and shall not be subject to deposit interest income tax.' ㊂ We propose to add two items under Article 4 in the original draft: ㊄ For profit-seeking businesses, whether companies, businesses, firms, factories, or individuals, with capital of two thousand or more, transactions with other companies, businesses, firms, factories, or individuals shall be handled in accordance with the preceding item. ㊅ Interest calculated on transactions between a main store and its branches shall be allowed to be offset against each other, but this does not apply to those whose income is determined by Article 6 of the Detailed Implementation Rules. The original draft, Article 5, under the sentence 'All funds belonging to educational and charitable institutions or organizations,' we propose to add 'or legal entities not for profit.' Also, 'by the deposit institution at the time of receiving the deposit,' we propose to amend it to 'and also notify the deposit institution at the time of receiving the deposit, and also to report or correct within one month from the date of tax commencement,' we propose to amend to 'should be reported or corrected within one month from the date of tax commencement.' ㊄ In the original draft, Article 6, the phrase 'but the funds of educational and charitable institutions or organizations,' we propose to add the phrase 'or legal entities not for profit.' ㊅ In the original draft, Article 10, 'Unlimited liability shareholders and supervisors,' we propose to delete the four characters 'and supervisors.' (Because supervisors are not legally responsible for execution.) ㊅ In the original draft, Article 11, 'should be at the time of each interest settlement,' we propose to amend to 'should be at the time of each actual payment of interest.' (Because the interest income tax adopts a withholding system, it must be withheld when the interest is actually paid.)"</p>
<h3>Income Tax Office Hosts Banquet for Political and Business Circles</h3>
<p>Expedite Preparation of Tax Refund Certificates; Negotiations on Tax Payment for Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance and the commencement of various types of income tax collection, the process has been proceeding smoothly. Director Liang Hejun, in order to facilitate inquiries from all sectors, hosted a banquet for various circles in the city the other day. At the same time, due to the small size of the office, the accounting section has been moved to the Bank of China for office work. A reporter from Shenzhou News visited Mr. Liang yesterday afternoon to inquire about the details.</p>
<p>Gratitude for Assistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Income Tax Office held a banquet for various circles in the city at the New Asia Hotel the other day. Those present included Du Yuesheng of the Local Association, Yu Hongjun and Li Dachao, secretaries of the Municipal Government, Pan Gongzhan, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Section Chief Wu Huanru, Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and all members Ke Ganchen, Gu Xin Yi, Jin Runxiang, Wang Boyuan, Zheng Zenan, as well as Lin Kanghou of the Bankers' Association, accountants Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo, etc. The office has been operating for just over a month, and the smooth progress has exceeded expectations, thanks to the assistance of the municipal authorities and the Local Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc. Therefore, the nation's good tax system can proceed smoothly, and the people's burden of pain can also be reduced. After Director Liang delivered his speech, in addition to expressing his gratitude, he also requested that inquiries on procedures and other matters can be made verbally in addition to official documents, in order to facilitate merchants, because a good tax system is often delayed by slow procedures. At that time, Mr. Wang Xiaolai talked about the rapid processing of tax refunds. The office is negotiating with the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Audit to use tax refund certificates, based on which overpaid taxes will be refunded. Currently, tax returns are filed at the office, and income tax payments are made at the bank, so overpayment may be unavoidable, but the government is determined to refund it.</p>
<p>Smooth Progress</p>
<p>According to Director Liang, income tax is a good direct tax system. Since its commencement, those who have filed and paid taxes have been numerous and the process has been quite smooth. Recently, ㊀ Chinese employees among foreign bank compradors have voluntarily and enthusiastically come to the office to file and pay taxes, which is sufficient to demonstrate their patriotism and will be specially reported to the ministry for commendation in the future. ㊁ Compatriots who deposit funds in foreign banks have also come to the office to voluntarily pay taxes. This spirit is truly capable of revitalizing China and will attract considerable attention from foreigners. ㊂ A reporter from a foreign newspaper visited the other day and was very impressed by the enthusiastic tax filing. ㊃ As for the taxation of foreign nationals, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is already in negotiations, and a concrete decision will be made soon. The process is progressing smoothly. ㊄ Due to the small size of the office, the accounting department has now been moved to the Bank of China for office work. In the future, efforts will be made to gather them at the same location.</p>

<h3>Silk and Satin Industries Organize Uniform Research Association</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association and the Electrical Silk Weaving Trade Association's representatives who went to Beijing to petition have returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, a special executive committee meeting was convened to report on the petition process. As a result, it was decided to jointly organize a uniform research association with various silk organizations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Executive Committee Meeting</p>
<p>The Silk and Satin Trade Association held its fifth executive committee meeting at its headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Chairman Luo Qinghua reported on the petition process to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry. Then, the following proposals were discussed: ㊀ Regarding the outcome of this petition, the Ministry of Interior hopes that silk organizations will jointly study concrete opinions for government reference. How should this be handled? The resolution was to contact various silk organizations and hire clothing experts to organize a uniform research association to conduct research and contribute to the government for reference at any time. ㊁ How to organize the uniform research committee? The resolution was: (A) This association will nominate Luo Qinghua, Shen Zicha, Jin Haoqing, Shen Jien, Wu Xingcha, Lou Fengshao, Niu Zhizhi, etc., seven people to participate. (B) Send letters to the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Trade Association and the Lake Society, each recommending one to three people to participate. (C) Clothing experts will be hired by this association to conduct joint research. ㊂ How should the style of clothing be stipulated in order to contribute to the government for adoption? The resolution was to publish in the newspaper and solicit various uniform style designs for formal wear, mourning clothes, military uniforms, civil servants' uniforms, business suits, student uniforms, etc., and essays explaining the materials and styles. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua Speaks</p>
<p>According to Luo's statement to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency yesterday, I went to Beijing this time to ask the central government for instructions, and the results were very satisfactory. When petitioning the Ministry of Interior, Director Chen Nianzhong of the Rites and Customs Department and Secretary Wang Ziqian received him. After stating his opinion, Chen replied that the Uniform Regulations were promulgated by the Ministry of Interior in the 18th year of the Republic, but the Uniform Regulations were not sufficient. The Ministry of Interior is currently soliciting opinions and conducting research from all parties. The principles for amending the Uniform Regulations this time are: ㊀ The established blue gown and black mandarin jacket will definitely not be abolished. ㊁ All uniforms must be limited to domestic products. ㊂ It is hoped that the Shanghai silk organizations will jointly study methods and opinions for government reference. When petitioning the Ministry of Industry, Director Zhang Yichou of the Department of Commerce received him and expressed sympathy for all points of the petition. After completing this petition, I have two major goals: ㊀ To jointly organize a uniform research committee with various silk organizations and hire clothing experts to conduct research and contribute to the government for reference at any time. ㊁ To solicit essays on uniform style designs and the relationship between silk and the international community and people's livelihood, because silk is a unique product of our country with a long history. The annual statistical value is more than 200 million yuan, and more than 30 million people in the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang rely on this for their livelihoods. I am currently organizing a uniform research committee with all parties so that I can make suggestions to the government at any time to make silk increasingly develop, and in terms of economy, there will be more than 200 million yuan in surplus every year.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Over Construction of Hardoon Building for Lobbying Fees</h3>
<p>Xin Shen Construction Company Never Won the Bid; Lobbying Fees Led to Disputes</p>
<p>Lu Nanchu, the owner of Xin Shen Construction Company, wanted to build the Hardoon Foreign Firm building near Nanjing Road and Henan Road last year. Pan Jisun, who lives at No. 9, Lane 76, Chongqing Road, and Fei Linyu, a former employee of Hardoon Foreign Firm, took 5,935 yuan in lobbying fees, but in the end, they still could not win the construction contract. Because of commission disputes, he sued Pan and others in the First Special District Court. The civil lawsuit has not yet ended, and Lu has also filed a private prosecution against Pan and Fei for fraud in the criminal court. The criminal court opened the trial yesterday afternoon. According to the plaintiff Lu Nanchu's statement, Pan came to him at the time and said that Hardoon Foreign Firm wanted to build an eight-story building, and he and Fei Linyu, an employee of the firm, could mediate and ensure that he would win the contract. He signed an agreement that after winning the bid, he would pay Pan a commission of 2.5% and Fei a commission of 5%. The total cost of materials and labor for the entire building would be more than 1 million, so the commissions should be 70,000 to 80,000. Later, Pan said that Mr. Ji's subordinates and Xie Weiyi and Wang Jichen, important figures in the Hardoon Garden, also needed to be rewarded and asked for more money. However, Pan and others took away 5,935 yuan in succession, and the contract ultimately belonged to others. Therefore, he asked to recover the paid funds, but the defendants turned around and sued me for the commission for the piling portion of the contract, which is still in civil litigation. As for Xie and Wang, I found out after investigation that they did not exist. Questioning the defendant Pan Jisun, he stated that the piling project was also introduced by us, and the plaintiff should pay the commission. I only got 500 yuan, and the remaining funds were received by Fei Linyu on behalf of the Hardoon Foreign Firm employees. Fei Linyu said that the commission that should be given to the Hardoon Foreign Firm employees according to the contract price of the piling project was more than 6,980 yuan. It was inconvenient for the firm's employees to collect this money from the plaintiff, so I received it on their behalf, but the plaintiff has not yet paid it off. All the evidence is in the civil case file, and he requested that it be retrieved. The court stated that the two parties in this case are currently in reconciliation outside the court and evidence needs to be investigated, so it was adjourned for further questioning on the afternoon of the 8th of next month.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn Market Drops Uniquely This Month</p>
<p>Warehouse Cotton Yarn Stocks Plentiful, Bulls Begin to Roll Over Contracts</p>
<p>Near-Far Price Difference Narrows, Most See Price Declines and Sell Off</p>
<p>The long-term trend in the cotton yarn market is turning upward, but this month has seen a unique decline. This is because current warehouse stocks of cotton yarn are robust, putting pressure on many participants. Some have begun to roll over their contracts, selling this month's contracts and buying contracts for future months. As a result, the price difference between near and far months is narrowing, creating a situation where near-term prices are lower and far-term prices are higher. In the market, some players have flipped from short to long positions, while others have liquidated their long positions. However, the majority are selling off due to expectations of price declines. In the afternoon, rumors of the issuance of national defense bonds caused buying interest to increase slightly, leading to higher prices. Gengfeng bought in large quantities, while Changfeng sold in large quantities, it is said.</p>
<p>June Cotton Yarn Futures Debut Yesterday</p>
<p>Before the opening of the standard cotton yarn market, prices for all months showed signs of rebounding. This was because the "gold gang" (speculators) came in to buy far-month contracts, tightening the market. However, at the opening of the second session, the market for third-grade yarn was mediocre, and a selling frenzy erupted, making the market noticeably looser. Many said that warehouse stocks of cotton yarn were substantial and would not be easily sold off quickly. As a result, momentum weakened significantly, and the closing price for third-grade yarn fell again. Far-month contracts also broke the 240 yuan level, but the long position holders in far-month contracts remained tight and did not give up. The result for standard cotton yarn was that the price for the current month fell by 1.5 to 0.6 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while far-month prices rose by 0.2 yuan. June contracts debuted yesterday at a price of 236.5 yuan, which was 10.04 yuan lower than the debut price for May contracts. At the opening of the afternoon session, the current month remained weak and listless, but long positions in far-month contracts rolled in and tightened. After the second session, it was heard that there were still 1,600 bales of spot cotton yarn traded. The price of third-grade yarn rebounded slightly, and far-month contracts gradually rose. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.269 to 1.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,550 bales, Taixing 1,000 bales, Senkang 1,100 bales, Renfeng 950 bales, Dachangcheng 1,700 bales, Changfeng 6,500 bales, Runkang 4,500 bales, and Tonghe 2,650 bales.

<p>Standard Cotton Benefits from Cotton Yarn Market</p>
<p>June Contracts Open at 44 Yuan</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption Stagnant, Supply Unseen</p>
<p>The cotton market has rebounded, and market sentiment is firm. This is because overseas cotton markets have turned upward, and although cotton stocks in various locations are substantial, arrivals in Shanghai have not been robust recently. As a result, short position holders have been taking profits and covering their positions. However, industry participants tend to sell off. In the afternoon, due to rumors that favored long positions, market prices rose with the cotton yarn market. However, spot cotton trading is quite sluggish, it is said. Before the opening of the standard cotton market, prices for all months rose uniformly, and the situation was tight. This was because American and Indian cotton both turned higher, leading to improved sentiment. However, industry participants still tended to sell off, but prices fell back later. June contracts debuted yesterday at a price of 44 yuan, which was only 0.35 yuan lower than the debut price for May contracts. The result for standard cotton was that prices for all months rose by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon session, market sentiment remained firm and strong, and the market was dry, with selling off not being strong. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Changhe sold 8,200 piculs, Hengde 1,400 piculs, Dachangcheng 4,500 piculs, Yikang 1,000 piculs, Yuanxing 1,300 piculs, Xinhua Chang 1,900 piculs, Yongda 1,300 piculs, Dachang 2,000 piculs, Xiecheng 1,400 piculs, Shenji 2,200 piculs, Shenda 2,800 piculs, and Yuda 2,300 piculs.

A comparison of daily market prices is as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption Stagnant, Mill Demand Listless, Supply Unseen</p>
<p>Japan Did Not Import Indian Cotton Last Week</p>
<p>The Bombay market last week saw a slight rebound due to manufacturers buying in bulk with price limits. However, compared to American cotton, it remained weak. Japanese buyers were absent from the market. Lancashire saw that Indian cotton was cheaper and absorbed a large amount. Cotton mills in mainland China and India did not buy much, as they believed it would be more advantageous to delay purchases until Japan was able to buy. A summary of last week's statistics is attached on the left (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>Japanese Cotton Yarn Continues to Fall, Cotton Prices Rise</p>

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Sales of Dark-Colored Cloth Are Still Considerable</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw soft sentiment due to the decline in the cotton yarn market. In addition, due to the cold and overcast weather, although there were small-scale transactions in light-colored cloth such as poplin, satin, printed cloth, and bleached cloth, there were no large-scale spot transactions. As a result, blue cloth, drill, broadcloth, and dark-colored printed cloth all showed considerable sales, with blue cloth being particularly strong. However, due to seasonal limitations, sales were short-lived, and the volume of goods sold was ultimately limited. However, the military uniform gangs' demand for 16-pound and 14-pound coarse cloth and coarse twill remained strong. Hua Shang Yong'an, Shenxin, Hengfeng, and other factories were doing their best to catch up with weaving, but there was still a shortage of supply. Spot goods and near-term goods were quite difficult to obtain, and market sentiment was quite firm. English-made Jardine coarse cloth, ranging from 11 to 16 pounds, also saw good sales. The sales of 9-pound coarse cloth were slightly sluggish due to price cuts by Hua Shang Baoxing underwear and Shenxin factories, but the output was not large, and prices did not loosen. The situation for East Asian fine cloth and fine twill was slightly soft. As it was just after the end of the month, both sides were watching and waiting for opportunities to enter and exit the market, and transactions were very quiet, it is said.</p>
<p>"Fire-Ham" Four-Ply Cloth Is Quite Popular</p>
<p>"Fire-Ham" four-ply cloth has been quite popular this spring. Tailors of Western-style clothing in the local area and other places have very strong demand, and daily retail and wholesale transactions are very brisk. There are more new colors arriving than last year. Western-style suits, spring overcoats, hunting attire, and harem pants are now very popular, leading to increasing sales. Yesterday, Riven "Fire-Ham" four-ply cloth was sold wholesale at 5.4 yuan per yard, Friendship at 6.25 yuan, and Rolph at 5.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Cold Spring Lingers, Futures Flour Buying Interest Suddenly Surges</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw prices rebounding across all months. The quoted price of foreign wheat had rebounded by about 0.3-0.4 yuan in the past two days. Therefore, at the opening, the quoted price increased due to the rise in foreign prices, and the cold and rainy spring weather also contributed to a sudden surge in buying interest for all months. The current month rose to as high as 4.035 yuan due to factory covering. April rose to 4.0275 yuan due to outside buying. July was opened at 3.5 yuan due to buying by large traders. August opened for the first time at 3.5 yuan, but quickly softened. After the first session, various parties freely offloaded positions, and prices for all months gradually fell back, decreasing by 0.3-0.4 yuan from the highest opening price. At the opening of the afternoon session, prices for March and April fell back to the 4 yuan level due to poor market sentiment, but then rebounded by 0.2-0.3 yuan due to continued factory covering. Sentiment for the new flour in July and August was flat, with little fluctuation. The future situation will depend on actual sales, it is said.</p>
<p>Sales of New Wheat for June and July Are Relatively Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw the quoted price of foreign wheat rebound by about 0.3-0.4 yuan after the opening of the morning session. In addition, the persistent spring rain made market sentiment become harder. Therefore, after the opening, prices for March and April were better by 0.03-0.05 yuan. The early contracts were also stable at first, but then prices fluctuated. At the opening of the afternoon session, the current month was very stable because the goods from the previous month were taken by the Tianjin gangs. Customers entered and exited April, and the market was temporarily calm. The new wheat for June, July, and August saw stronger selling because of the soft price of new flour, decreasing by 0.03-0.05 yuan compared to the morning. The spot wheat market saw stable prices due to both arrivals and sales being quiet. The opening price for Wuyi wheat was 6.6 yuan, Huai'an wheat 6.56 yuan, Jiangbei wheat 6.54 yuan, and Hefei wheat 6.25 yuan. Fuxin took 2,500 bags, and Shenda took 500 bags, it is said.</p>
<p>Sales of Edible Rice in This District Are Still Acceptable</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the total source of goods from various gangs was over thirty, about six thousand three or four hundred dan of rice. Within that, the amount of Bo Dao rice was over ten. The weather was overcast and rainy, and market sentiment was fixed. Therefore, although the sales in this district were normal, the bag orders were only made from Xi'an and Qingdao gangs who took Bo Dao rice, which was about seven to eight hundred bags. Market conditions exhibited stability. The condition of both thick and thin japonica rice was without both honor and disgrace, the Du Yang Jian and Yin Yuan rice types were similar.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the source of goods from each location along the river was not plentiful, about seventeen or eighteen. Because of the overcast and rainy weather, the appetite of each type of good was acceptable. Customer character was tough, as such the high quality of White Japonica rice barely stood, Medium quality was catching up tightly, near the price corner, and the Early Rice followed in tight fashion. The bag orders of Bo Dao rice did not materialize. There were a few transactions in this city. The price shape of the Bo Dao rice was pretty and delicate. The price shape of Du Jian rice exhibited a tight trend. The guest sharp rice price was fixed at Yangfu, and Yin Bian Yuan rice stood tall. Each of the remaining goods' prices were stable. However, at close, the path of each type of good seemed to be stagnant.</p>
<p>There Are Sales of Guest Indica Rice in Both the North and South</p>
<p>— The Market Price Slightly Increased by 0.03-0.05 Yuan Due to Rain —</p>
<p>Yesterday's guest indica rice market situation slightly changed for the better. Although the total volume of goods coming in was still ten to twenty thousand bags, because of the cold and rainy spring weather, there were possible losses for the goods of the spring harvest, merchants' thoughts turned to a more defensive position, and were not as eager to sell off their wares as in previous days. Furthermore, the Cantonese appetite recovered, and Shantou and the Northern seas were both adorned with purchases, and the local appetite was particularly active. The total amount of transactions exceeded twenty thousand bags. Although the market price did not change greatly, market sentiment improved, and the market price surreptitiously strengthened by 0.03-0.05 yuan. Throughout the entire day, a volume of fifteen thousand two hundred bags of Jiangxi rice, seven thousand one hundred bags of Xiang rice, one thousand five hundred bags of Wen Yong rice, and three hundred bags of Han brown rice were opened for sale, with the majority still being purchased by Cantonese gangs.</p>
<p>Oil Prices Decline, Bean Cakes Stable</p>
<p>Recently, there has been no special situation in the oil and bean cake market around the Lantern Festival of the old calendar. Various sources have not yet arrived in large quantities, but sales are also normal. Therefore, market prices have inevitably become weaker. Furthermore, the Dalian Exchange was closed for many days during the Spring Festival, resulting in little change in the exchange market. Yesterday, 700 pieces of various soybean oils were opened for trading in the local market. Market prices fell by 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. Peanut oil also declined by 0.2 yuan, with 800 pieces traded.

<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>The Price of White Granulated Sugar from This Factory Fell by 0.1 Yuan</p>
<p>Over 100 Bags of Zhangdiao Green Sugar Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>The sugar market remained stable yesterday. The guild's marked prices were 22.55 yuan for spot coarse granulated white sugar, 7.35 yuan for re-export sugar, down 0.05 yuan, with few transactions.

<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>User Silk Is More Lively</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk industry saw no market in New York on the day, and the Yokohama selling rate saw fluctuations for distant contracts. A total of -7 yuan for spot and +1 yuan for distant contracts. The Shanghai silk market hovered with hesitation. Because of the sluggish overseas silk market prices and stagnant sales, market sentiment also exhibited a tendency to soften. Yesterday, the foreign merchant silk market was calm. The user silk market was more lively. The America-Asia Silk Factory and each silk weaving factory slightly bought in. White factory, Tiantai, and zebra brands saw some sales opened, but the market rate was about 5 yuan to 10 yuan lower than in early last week. Yesterday, a total of 45 bags were opened for sale.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Sales of 5mm Steel Plates Are Strong</p>
<p>Since overseas prices for 5mm steel plates have trended upwards, prices in this port have also risen accordingly. For example, lightweight steel plates are estimated at 15 yuan per dan, and heavyweight steel plates are estimated at 14 yuan. However, because the prices are too high, there have been few transactions. Recently, industry participants in this port, seeing the unfavorable environment, are willing to lower prices to sell. Therefore, lightweight steel plates are estimated at 14 yuan, and heavyweight steel plates are estimated at 13 yuan. Trading has suddenly increased due to the rush of buyers, with gangs from Qingdao, Yantai, Hankou, Shantou, and Xiamen all buying. As a result, the market situation has suddenly become brisk, and industry participants on this street are also frantically adding to their stocks, fearing that current stocks will run out. As a result, transactions have increased sharply. It is estimated that over one to two thousand dan have been sold, and there are still many people in negotiations. Therefore, the market situation is very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Review of the American Economy and Silk Consumption (3)</h3>
<p>— Tian Yu</p>
<p>It is very clear here that the area of silk consumption has been more deeply encroached upon by other clothing fibers. The threat of silk retreating is naturally the result of the expansion of the territory of rayon. However, silk has superior qualities, such as luster and strength, which are unmatched by rayon. Moreover, the recovery of the American economy, the largest customer, and the increased share of silk's exclusive territory in women's hosiery by 12%, etc., should have been good opportunities for exceptional development. Why is it that consumption not only does not increase proportionally with the economic recovery, but also decreases significantly? This is not easily understood by the average person. However, if we analyze it carefully, we will find that this phenomenon is not accidental.</p>
<p>Originally, the rise of the economy inevitably leads to rising object prices. The price of silk, following the expensive trend of the second half of the previous year, has maintained its relatively high price. This can be seen in the table below:</p>
<p>Comparison of American Raw Silk Prices (▲ indicates decrease)</p>

<h3>Sin</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Sin is not etched on people's faces.</p>
<p>People who hide great sins often point fingers at people who reveal small mistakes!</p>
<p>One should not say that there is no sin, it is just that sin has not been revealed.</p>
<p>Everyone hopes for rewards for merits, but no one hopes for punishment for sins.</p>
<p>People's criminal behavior mostly occurs when they are poor.</p>
<p>Increasing the effectiveness of the law is not as good as reducing the root causes of crime.</p>
<p>Those who help people commit crimes are more sinful than those who commit crimes.</p>
<p>A person uses money to commit crimes, and can also use money to cover up his crimes!</p>
<p>In human nature, there is a kind of goodness and a kind of evil. Because goodness is good, it is often overcome by evil. Therefore, people should cultivate their own goodness to suppress their own evil.</p>
<p>For a person who is currently behaving well, there is no need to ask about his past mistakes and sins.</p>
<h3>Zhang Taiyan's Reasons for Opposing Vernacular Poetry</h3>
<p>— Yan Feikun</p>
<p>Ever since Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi, and their group advocated new poetry and overthrew old poetry, those who followed suit for a time had a "stormy" effect, especially among young people. However, opponents also arose one after another. The two sides firmly guarded the old and new fortifications, fighting fiercely for many years. Up to now, the old and new "go their separate ways" without a real result.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan is also a member of the old fortifications who opposes the new poetry. People who do not know the bottom think that Mr. Zhang is "seeing what is benevolent and seeing what is wise," but that is wrong. Originally, Mr. Zhang's reasons for opposing the new poetry, from the standpoint of "poetry," are truly "justified." For example, in Mr. Zhang's "Reply to Huang Jiashu's Letter," there are places where he discusses new poetry. He said: "...Vernacular poetry did not originate with modern people. Yuan and Bai often had it. What I oppose is its lack of rhyme, not its use of the vernacular. Therefore, I use Shi Siming's "Cherry Poem" as a taunt. Generally speaking, poetry must be eternal words. If the rhythm is long and there is no rhyme to harmonize it, then listening to it will definitely be unpleasant. This is why the ancients had no unrhymed poetry. Moreover, if poetry has no rhyme, then chanting history is no different from historical commentary; generally chanting mountains and rivers, scenery, and narrating the difficulty of traveling is no different from travelogues. Why must it be called poetry?..."</p>
<p>This passage breaks through the shortcomings of new poetry in one sentence. We should nod our heads and be pleased. Even those who advocate it, I think, may not have sufficient reason to come and defend it.</p>
<h3>Hair Buns</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, women's hairstyles can be said to have exhausted all possibilities of change.</p>
<p>Qing Dynasty-style hair buns were eliminated along with the revolutionary tide. At that time, men were in vogue with haircuts, so women imitated the ancient style and moved the hair buns that hung behind their heads to the top of their heads, shaped like cow dung, beautifully named "Pan Xiang" (Coiled Incense) buns, but some directly called them "cow dung" buns. Due to the habit of three hundred years, there was always a feeling of being unaccustomed to wearing the hair bun on the top of the head, so after a short time, it returned to the back of the head. Then, the Pan Xiang bun at the back of the head changed into a "Bo Xin" bun, also called "Feng Liang" (Cool Breeze) bun. The initial period of the Bo Xin bun was close to the back of the head. Afterwards, it gradually drooped downwards, reaching below the shoulders. The more it drooped, the more fashionable it was. However, later on, every piece of clothing was stained with a large oil stain, so the "Shan Zi" (Fan) bun, which was close to the back of the head, came into being. It was narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, shaped like an open folding fan. However, the procedure of combing the Fan bun was complicated and took at least an hour, so it evolved into the "Shu Ai Si" (Vertical S-shape) bun, and further into the "Heng Ai Si" (Horizontal S-shape) bun. When the National Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition, secured Wuhan, and recovered Songhu (Shanghai), women's hair buns were all cut off by hairdressers. As a result, the ever-changing hair bun problem was fundamentally solved. Although recently there have occasionally been a few modern women who styled their remaining hair into diamond-shaped buns to show off their uniqueness, these are only a very small number. The fate of the hair bun has largely reached its final stage. In another twenty years, the hair bun may be naturally eliminated.</p>
<p>In the past, hair buns were regarded as a sign of a woman's diligence or laziness. Shiny hair meant diligence, and vice versa. Therefore, before women cut their hair buns, the first thing they did every morning was to comb their hair buns, which was quite troublesome. However, now that the hair buns are gone, the remaining hair has become the standard for whether a woman is fashionable or not. Only those with fashionable perms are valued, otherwise, they are considered country women. It can be seen that the ancients always said that hair was "three thousand strands of worry," which was indeed true. Furthermore, women always liked to insert a head full of pearls and jade when combing their hair buns, which cost a lot. After cutting their hair, they had a water perm every half month and an electric perm every month, the cost of which was also considerable. Therefore, women's cutting of hair buns is not actually a kind of progress, but merely a transformed hair bun. The ancients had a saying about watching hair combing under a crystal curtain, which everyone regarded as a romantic affair. When haircuts were first introduced, people generally thought that the disappearance of hair buns was a great disappointment. However, after the hair buns were gone, women still could not do without combing their hair in front of the mirror every day. At the same time, they all carried a small comb in their handbags. Even in the tram, there were still those who combed their temples in front of the mirror. Going without hair buns is more elegant than before, which may not be what most people expected.</p>
<h3>Chewing Betel Nuts</h3>
<p>— Xi Kan</p>
<p>People in Changsha City often give each guest a small packet of Guizi betel nuts after a feast. It is said that in southern Hunan, betel nuts have become a daily necessity, probably due to the proximity to the Five Ridges, which helps to dispel dampness and epidemics. Many of my friends are from Xiangtan, and they all like to chew betel nuts. I can only chew Guizi betel nuts, but I cannot handle the heavy gray betel nuts that people from Xiangtan chew. That kind of betel nut tastes bitter and astringent, and the lime on it, I don't know if it's natural lime or oyster shell lime, is really unpalatable!</p>
<p>The habit of chewing betel nuts among southerners has a long history. There are records of betel nuts in the History of the Southern Dynasties, but unfortunately, I cannot recall the original text from memory. Zhou Qufei of the Song Dynasty said in his "Ling Wai Dai Da," Volume 8: Betel nuts are produced in the Li Dong area of Hainan and also in Jiaozhi. The tree is like a palm tree, and the fruits grow between the leaves, like willow branches, with berries clustered on them. The ones picked in spring are soft betel nuts, which are very delicious. The ones picked in summer and autumn are dried and called rice betel nuts, and those soaked in salt are called salt betel nuts. The small and pointed ones are called chicken heart betel nuts, and the large and flat ones are called big belly betel nuts, all of which are medicines for regulating qi. Sea merchants sell them, and the Qiong officials collect five out of ten taxes on them annually. The Guangzhou Customs collects betel nut tax, tens of thousands of strings of cash per year. Therefore, the amount collected in various places is uncountable.</p>
<p>Based on this record, we can know that in the Song Dynasty, betel nut tax was also a major source of revenue for Guangzhou, and the prevalence of chewing betel nuts at that time can be imagined. At the same time, in this record, I learned about the origin, shape, type, and function of betel nuts. According to my experience, chewing betel nuts after a meal generates a lot of saliva, which undoubtedly helps digestion. Moreover, after drinking and eating to excess, and getting tired of oily food, chewing a betel nut makes one feel refreshed and comfortable. As for its disadvantages, that is unknown. Old medical books say that it lowers qi and consumes qi, which seems mysterious and intangible. I hope that medical experts will take the time to test betel nuts and analyze their composition in order to determine their effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Leisurely Solo Drink</h3>
<h3>The Mated Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven (Whispered Sympathy for Mother's Heart, Repentance, Filial Piety, Autumn Light Dimmed, Dark Eyebrows, Evoking Thoughts at the Scenery)</p>
<p>Menglan nodded with a smile and said, "Second sister-in-law, every word you say is the truth. Second brother probably said a lot of bad things about me behind my back, right?" The second young mistress repeatedly shook her head and said, "Your second brother has never mentioned a word to me." Menglan smiled and said, "Sister-in-law, don't misunderstand. What I'm asking isn't whether my brother is discussing my shortcomings behind my back. But like what second sister-in-law said, I'm neither new nor old now, and I can't make a living." The second young mistress, because she had been sitting for a long time, had wrinkles in her clothes, so she stood up and tugged at her clothes a few times. Looking down at her chest, she raised her eyelids and looked at Menglan's face. She smiled and said, "But Mother sometimes mentions you, saying that the younger sister is getting older every year, and she'll graduate soon, but what will happen after graduation?" Menglan smiled and said, "I can't become an official after graduation." The second young mistress said, "It's not for that. Mother means that a girl, even if she lives to be a hundred years old, is still someone else's person. But the old lady can't figure out what you mean at all. So because of these things, her old illness is probably not easy to get rid of completely. The more time passes, the more people are pressing her, and they might force some illness out of the old lady." As she said this, she frowned. Menglan said, "Who is pressing her more and more?" The second young mistress, who was originally wearing a worried look on her face, smiled slightly when she heard this. Menglan picked up a piece of pine nut candy in the dish, but put it down again. She probably understood very well how this smile on her sister-in-law's face came about. So she put down the candy and suddenly stood up and said, "If Mother has any difficulties, just tell me. Even if I'm unfilial, I can't let the old lady lose her old life because of me." The second young mistress said, "It's not that bad. It seems..." As she said this, she tilted her head and pretended to be thinking. Then she continued, "I heard that the Liu family recently sent someone to set a date again. It's between September and October. And they added that if it's because of the younger sister's studies that this date can't be agreed upon, that's a small matter. After the happy event, you can still let the younger sister go to school as before. Mother didn't say anything, but Father probably agreed. Mother tried several times to tell you, but she was always afraid that you would be unhappy. Originally, what girl is willing to leave her mother? Mother is just worried, so her health is not very good." The more Menglan listened, the paler her face became. She sat down, lowered her head, and fiddled with the corner of her clothes, unable to speak for a long time. The second young mistress was also secretly watching her constantly. She didn't interrupt at this time. (139)</p>
<p>Short Stories</p>
<h3>Sound of Waves and Misty Rain</h3>
<p>— Xia Fei</p>
<p>The continuous cold rain seemed to have thrown my heart into a gloomy sea, and my heart was soaked in that gloomy taste. So, I began to feel disgusted with this bitter rural life.</p>
<p>I returned to my hometown sadly, and it has been more than a week in a hurry; but those three or four days of rain really made me feel more uncomfortable than being in prison. Especially at night, I often sat alone, staring blankly at the dim light, listening to the rustling sound of rain outside the window; that endless loneliness was gnawing at my heart like a poisonous snake, and I was in pain.</p>
<p>Finally, on a drizzly morning, I resolutely left my family, taking this simple suitcase and embarking on that distant journey. The whistle had already sounded for the second time, so many passengers swarmed towards the ship, and a burst of commotion shook the ship. We went down to the cabin, and the ship turned its head and sailed into the waves, and the lines of sight of the senders and the departed gradually disappeared in the sound of "take care."</p>
<p>There were not many people in the cabin. I occupied a corner and sat down, looking out the window, a kind of melancholy and a kind of loneliness chasing me closely.</p>
<p>The wind was howling like crazy, and the ship was bumping in the waves. We were all like children sleeping in a cradle, rolling to this side for a moment and falling to that side for another. The teapot and teacups on the table were also overturned. Many people were frightened, children were crying, and women were vomiting by the side of the ship. I stared blankly at the lake, which was shrouded in a white misty rain, as if covered with a heavy layer of wet fog. Waves as high as small hills crashed down on the side of the ship one after another, and the ship swayed with the ups and downs of the waves; spray flew onto the deck, and the glass windows rattled. The raindrops hit the surface of the waves, showing honeycomb-like holes, but they immediately disappeared with the waves.</p>
<p>The loud sound of waves and the crisp sound of rain were making a noise on the vast Taihu Lake, like the sound of a mountain collapsing.</p>
<p>The ship seemed to be a stubborn animal, carrying dozens of lives, bravely, braving the waves, facing the wind and rain, and moving forward in the long misty waves. The blurry isolated islands and vague shadows of mountains passed by the side of the ship.</p>
<p>When the ship was approaching Xukou, a patch of black dots suddenly appeared on the hazy lake surface, more than ten feet away from the ship. It looked like many things were floating on the water, or like stars crowded in the sky, arranged very neatly. Looking at them from a distance, they were really beautiful.</p>
<p>"What is that? Are they cormorants!" a fashionable girl exclaimed happily, forgetting the pain of seasickness just now. Then, the young man in a suit next to her seemed to correct her mistake and said:</p>
<p>"No, these are ducks, ducks are wild ducks." A white-sailed boat gradually drifted from the mountain, and very quickly, it approached the middle of a patch of black dots, so, only a burst of sound was heard, and countless black dots all flew into the sky. At that moment, only a black shadow was seen moving in the sky.</p>
<p>The ship was sailing in the sound of waves and misty rain, but the people in the cabin calmed down as if they were exhausted. When it was close to entering the port, the wind weakened and the waves calmed down, but the endless bitter rain was still dripping on the deck.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>The Dry Bridge</h3>
<p>— Xu Xia Wei</p>
<p>"Dry Bridge!" It quietly spans over the railway, holding the transportation hub connecting the west side of the North Railway Station to the other side of the railway; Its style. Although it is very simple, it also contains the inherent oriental aesthetics of China. The wooden railings, the wooden pillars, everything is made of wood. However, it has its characteristics, it has its advantages. On the contrary, all the equipment is for practical use, and it is not just a kind of decoration for appreciation. Although, there is also a tall dry bridge in the South Railway Station. Maybe other provinces and cities have its similar types, but everything is famous because of its merits. The achievements of the North Station Dry Bridge are indeed likely to surpass other places. Therefore, when we people living in Shanghai mention the Dry Bridge, the one between Xinmin Road and Qiujiang Road will pop up in our minds!</p>
<p>The twentieth-century monsters filled with passengers and goods are constantly coming and going under its belly, and I don’t know how many people pass by on its back every day. It is not angry, it is not acting coquettish, it is not afraid of violent encroachment, nor is it afraid of the ravages of wind and frost. It faithfully serves the society and mankind. For decades, it has been like a day. It is indeed a calm, hardworking, and practical offender who does not advocate slogans. Its achievements are truly great! If it were gone for a day, the nearby traffic would be disrupted, and people coming and going would complain even more, but now few people can pay attention to it, and even hate it. Really, I really feel very wronged for it.</p>
<p>It once witnessed the January 28th Incident, the bloody battle for national survival, and even witnessed the barbaric acts of a certain country's military expansion. The bloody battle lasted for thirty-four days, and our army finally retreated due to strategic reasons! It! - Dry Bridge - also suddenly lost protection, but it seemed to be determined to coexist and die with the country, always standing still, not being afraid, not escaping, and the enemy's fierce artillery fire and huge bombs could not damage it. As a result, the Shanghai War ended, and it still faithfully served the society. General Weng Zhaoyuan said: "Bullets will automatically avoid brave soldiers." Indeed, it was a victory.</p>
<p>"The head can be broken, the blood can flow, but the country cannot be destroyed."</p>
<p>The Shanghai War is now five years ago! All the constructions destroyed by the warmongers have gradually returned to their original state. Under the government's efforts to revive, it is impossible to find the traces of the bloody battle between the two armies that year. Only on the cement retaining wall of the south embankment of the Dry Bridge, there are still such vaguely distinguishable, generous and passionate characters written in lime water by the Independent 156th Brigade of the Army.</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shanghai Shen Bao</p>
<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Banning Dancing and Smoking and Leading by Example</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mei</p>
<p>The joint meeting of the directors of moral education of middle schools in the city, convened by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, was held at the YMCA the day before yesterday. In addition to discussing the banning of middle school students from dancing and smoking cigarettes, Pan, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, personally attended to report the significance of the meeting and to provide guidance on moral education. It can be seen how concerned the authorities are about the future of young students.</p>
<p>Director Pan said in his report: "...In addition to implementing the prescribed plan for moral education, the most effective method is for teachers and students to be able to live together. As the saying goes, 'Teaching by example is better than teaching by words,' and 'Teaching by example is followed, while teaching by words is disputed.' It can be seen that leading by example is the best method of moral education: Scholars follow, and students are originally imitating others, but imitation must have a model, and teachers are the model for students, so the director of moral education should help the principal, and make all teachers and staff understand this meaning, and everyone leads by example as a good model for students, so that students, no matter who they learn from, can improve every day and become healthy citizens. ..."</p>
<p>How to cultivate young students to become "healthy citizens"? Leaving aside other conditions, leading by example is always an essential condition. Or, because of the misunderstanding of "being a teacher," his world view and outlook on life do not conform to the spirit of the times, and thus will lead pure students to a dead end, but that is already another question; I believe that students themselves will also have standards for what to choose and discard. Middle school students are no longer kindergarten children. They will certainly not believe that one plus two equals three. Even if they do believe it, they will compare this answer with the "modern facts of the country" to see if it is three.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think, whether the qualifications of "being a teacher" are sufficient is another question. But to make students believe in the teacher and become "teachers are the model for students," leading by example is always an essential condition. For example, one of the motions at this joint meeting was "how to prohibit middle school students from dancing and smoking cigarettes," and I hope that in the future, no middle school principals, directors of moral education, or even teachers and staff will be found in dance halls, even if they declare when they are found that they are there to investigate whether students have violated the ban, the result will not be believable. As for smoking cigarettes, it is inevitable that they will not smoke in the classroom or the teachers' lounge in the future, but I also hope that they will not smoke in other places, even in their residences or where they think other people will not notice. Because it is not a resolution, it is okay not to lead by example, but if it is resolved, and those who are "teachers" should lead by example, then if unfortunately discovered, in addition to violating the ban, there is also the malpractice of teaching students to comply in public and defy in private, and to cheat in private.</p>
<p>But, can the "teachers" do it? I dare not say that they cannot, but I also dare not write a guarantee that they are all-powerful. For example, not long ago, we saw in the newspaper the news that a principal was suing a hotel for opening a long room. "Opening a long room" is certainly not among smoking and dancing, but modern education says that teaching students to open long rooms, it seems that it is not to that point.</p>
<p>Leading by example is essential in teaching: whether leading by example is contrary to the spirit of the times or not, we are willing to compare it with the "modern facts of the country": now, let's "listen to their words and watch their actions" to see what happens later.</p>
<h3>Homesickness</h3>
<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>Calmness like a thin veil gently covered the entire school, the school like an ancient temple, like - a large无人的architecture, everywhere touching the desolate atmosphere.</p>
<p>The dormitory, which I usually disliked for its noise, was mostly empty. The dim light from the oil lamp in the corridor and the candle on my desk reminded me of the Buddha hall in an ancient temple! Did the huqin break its sound, and did the Brahma bells go mute?</p>
<p>...Defeated by melancholy! Although I have been wandering for five or six years, crossing countless mountains and rivers, how can anyone forget their home? When it gets dark, birds also return to their nests; when the sun sets, cows also return to their sheds - how can anyone forget their home?</p>
<p>Among the dozens of people left, Liu was the only one I recognized. Although we didn't have any deep friendship in the past few days, we have had a deep friendship with each other in recent days. He originally lived in the house opposite me. Because of loneliness, he moved over the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Liu is a tall man, his cheeks full of thought, his hair messy and long, as if he hasn't shaved for years. He likes to drink and shell peanuts, and his capacity for alcohol is not necessarily great, but when he gets drunk, he talks non-stop. He is from Heilongjiang. Like me, he hasn't reunited at home for five years. When he is drunk, he often says to me:</p>
<p>"Don't be like a girl! Who doesn't have a home - just don't think about it! Speaking of which: your home is in Southeast Asia, but it's just a bit far away; for me, it's probably difficult to go back. Come on, have a drink. The ancients said it well: wine can dispel sorrow. Once the brain is messed up, home - you won't think about anything. ..."</p>
<p>I can't drink alcohol, the bitter taste of alcohol scares me, and I always remember how my mother cared for me; every time, Liu's invitation was therefore rejected by me. ...However, I couldn't resist it after all. Every day, I watched Liu, awake and depressed, pour cup after cup of wine into his stomach, and then, with a flushed face, excitedly, spewing saliva, talk or sing loudly, and when he got tired or his tongue stiffened, he would go down and start snoring. It seemed that wine really dispelled his sorrow. ...I became envious. ...One day, when Liu was drunk, I swallowed four glasses of Wujiapi in one breath. ...Gradually, I felt both my ears and cheeks becoming hot, my head a little dizzy, but I didn't want to speak. Although the thoughts were rising and falling and stirring non-stop, my mouth seemed to be getting tighter and tighter. I lay down and felt unusually uncomfortable. It seemed that the bed and the house were shaking, as if someone was pressing hard on my chest, making me unable to breathe. I wanted to cry as if I had been wronged. I wanted to be quiet, but I couldn't control myself. My blood seemed to be boiling all over my body, as if it wanted to rush out. ...I felt unusually annoyed, and suddenly thought of going somewhere cool outside, I put on my coat, I rushed out of the dormitory and went to the fields.</p>
<p>The fields looked unusually desolate under the gray and heavy sky. I wandered aimlessly in the wet soil of the fields...until I began to feel cold, the cold north wind had frozen my ears and nose red and stiff; my feet also seemed a little sore, and a little hard. ...When I came back, I was much clearer, and the journey was especially strenuous. ...</p>
<p>Back in the dormitory, I immediately heard Liu singing Xue Li sighing at the moon.</p>
<p>"He's drunk again?"</p>
<p>I thought. And I was a little dazed again. ...</p>
<h3>In a Simplified Primary School</h3>
<p>— Huang Jing</p>
<p>Failed again! I spent the entire summer vacation staying in Tianjin looking for a job. Yet I gained nothing! I’ve reached the end of my rope, what should I do? Everything will become a dream! But I still have to live, to live with the greatest courage! So, I returned to Beiping with a heavily wounded heart, placing my last hope there. But how could that work? Beiping, this ancient city swaying in the wind and rain, is not what it used to be! Its throat has been seized by the claws of a powerful beast! It is not allowed to breathe freely! Only two years after I left it, it has become so terrifying! Countless innocent people are opening their mouths in hunger, searching everywhere for a bowl of rice! Everything clearly suggests to me that there is no hope of finding a job! So desperate, none of my friends have the ability to take care of me. Under these circumstances, I wanted to leave immediately, but unexpectedly, a friend actually found me a teaching position at a "Simplified Primary School." I could earn a salary of "thirteen yuan" per month. Although this terrible and pathetic amount of "thirteen yuan" is also called a "salary," I have to accept this rice bowl!</p>
<p>I didn't know before that this "ancient cultural city" of Beiping had so-called "Simplified Primary Schools." There used to be "People's Schools," but there were very few of them. Now, these "Simplified Primary Schools" exist in every district. Perhaps the government is also implementing a policy of universal education, so they are also extending their favor to the children of the poor. These kinds of primary schools are established by the "Autonomous District Public Offices"! In name, it is "poor children can study without money," but in reality, the education expenses still come from the poor themselves, and those running the education are still skimming profits from it. On the surface, it is "entirely for the benefit of the common people."</p>
<p>All the simplified primary schools in the city are named after the street where the school is located. Our school is located on "Fenfang Liuli Street" outside Xuanwumen, so the school is called "Fenfang Liuli Street Simplified Primary School." The school is located in a Guangdong Guild Hall. Although there is a golden plaque with the words "Lianqin Guild Hall" at the gate, only two Guangdong people live inside. The rest of the people are very mixed. There are storytellers of drum ballads, hawkers, and people who run foreign car factories. This is completely a large mixed courtyard.</p>
<p>Both classrooms are dark and filthy! The old plaster on the walls has peeled off! The brick corners are exposed. The wooden frames of the windows have been damaged beyond repair by the wind and rain, and there is no way to paste paper on them. Even if the cold autumn wind is unrestrained, they have to endure it. The students huddle together quietly; they are used to suffering, and suffering has long conquered them!</p>
<p>If you walk into this classroom, you are sure to be startled if you are not careful. The potholes on the ground will make you stumble! Even more pitiful are the desks and benches, almost all missing a leg or having three legs. Not a single bench does not need bricks to prop it up. Sometimes, while I am lecturing, a student suddenly falls from the bench, causing a burst of laughter. Because of these desks and benches, students are constantly fighting, complaining to the teacher, and being beaten to settle the matter. But those who run the education do not pay attention to these educational facilities. They always feel that it is already extraordinary that poor children can be given books to read, how can they look for comfort?</p>
<p>The most active person in the school is not the "principal," but Lao Bai, the errand boy and messenger. He has one eye. According to him, he used to be a soldier, got injured, and is now retired. No student is not subject to his control. He says one is one, and two is two. Those poor children do not know how to resist him. Every day he buys some food from outside and sells it at school, doubling the price.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The principal never comes to class on time. Sometimes I have already finished a class when he arrives at school. However, if the Autonomous District Public Office wants to send someone to inspect, he arrives at school early in the morning, ordering the errand boy to sweep this and sweep that, and scaring the students: "Whoever makes noise or talks when the inspector comes will be expelled!"</p>
<p>A month passed! My "salary" was not paid. It was not until the tenth of the second month that I received it. Later, Lao Bai secretly told me that the principal is used to withholding teachers' salaries. In fact, the Public Office sends the salaries at the end of the month.</p>

How can his aspirations be realized in life? The three brothers sworn brotherhood in the Peach Garden. Prayed to the gods not to betray the alliance. Together they swept away the Yellow Turbans.

He shook his prestige above the Hulao Pass. He depended on Yuan Shao and Liu Biao. Unable to withstand Cao Cao's million soldiers. He temporarily borrowed Jingzhou to rest his feet.

<p>Li Shude (940) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Perspective"</p>
<p>All the flowers have bloomed, and the fragrance of plum blossoms remains. The most miserable thing in life is illness. Food and drink are nothing but soup and medicine. The only one who serves is Little Mei Xiang. How hateful, the evil illness often torments me. Making me, feeble and listless. Seeing through that there is no benefit in life. It is hard to avoid death, young or old. But I compare my body to a house. Teeth are the door and the mouth is like the hall. Fine black hair is like roof tiles. Clear eyes are like emerald silk windows. The eyes are like pairs and the ears are like paintings. The bridge of the nose is like a large central hall. Hands and feet are like the pillars of the house. The back is like the beam of the house. Twenty-four ribs are the rafters, and the winding intestines are like a winding corridor. Ten fingers are busy welcoming guests. A winding wall and a stinking skin bag. When the day of impermanence arrives. The doors and windows are closed. Spring green is like a magnificent room. Old age is like a collapsed hall. Wealth and glory are originally false. Like a dream of yellow millet. Millions of fortunes are hard to carry with you. Only leaving behind. A lonely soul drifting to the west, I am one who has seen through the world and wishes to cultivate myself.</p>

<h3>"One in a Million" to be Released</h3>
<p>Ice Skating Queen's Stunning Work</p>
<p>Sonja Henie, a Norwegian girl, has won the ice skating championship three times in a row in the World Games. Her reputation has long been famous throughout the world. The golden statues and trophy awards in her home fill an entire room. She has also performed many times before emperors and kings in various European countries, and has received no small number of precious awards. She is not only good at ice skating, but also a famous ice skating queen in Europe. Therefore, Twentieth Century Fox specifically spared no expense to invite her to star in the film "One in a Million" (it is said that her salary for starring in this film was $150,000), and also selected many good supporting actors for her. Sonja Henie has displayed all her skills in this film, which is truly a magnificent sight. It is rumored that the film will soon be released at the Grand Guangming Theater, and it is indeed a good film worth watching.</p>
<h3>A Scene from Minxin Phonograph's "New Humanitarianism"</h3>
<h3>"In Spring"</h3>
<p>— One of the Interludes from "Crossroads" —</p>
<p>The new Mingxing film directed by Shen Xiling, starring Zhao Dan, Bai Yang, Ying Yin, Lü Ban, Sha Meng, Yi Ming, etc., "Crossroads," has been completely filmed and passed the Central Inspection Committee. It depicts four typical types of young people: one revolutionary, one wavering, one optimistic, and one pessimistic. The subject matter is realistic, the style is fresh, and there is an interlude called "In Spring," with lyrics written by the famous female poet Guan Lu and music composed by He Luting. The lyrics are recorded below:</p>
<p>"In spring, white flowers are fragrant, lang li ge lang li ge lang li ge lang, the warm sun shines in the sky, shining on my ragged clothes, lang li ge lang li ge lang li ge lang, walking through the streets and alleys, for food and for clothing, busy morning and night, lang li ge lang li ge lang li ge lang, even without money, I must eat a bowl of rice, and I must have a room to live in, even if the landlady makes strange faces, lang li ge lang li ge lang li ge lang. Poverty does not fall from the sky, raw iron can be tempered into steel, as long as we work hard and move forward, even if high mountains block the road, lang li ge lang li ge lang li ge lang, met a good girl, a dear good girl, a naive girl, don't be sad, don't be hurt, life is like a battlefield, be healthy, be strong, work hard on a shift, be healthy, be strong, everyone work hard on a shift."</p>
<h3>Amazing Lu Ming</h3>
<p>Yihua's sorrowful and beautiful epic film, written by Pan Zienong and directed by Chen Kengran, "Elastic Daughter," took half a year and cost a huge sum of money. Nineteen parts have been completed, and it will soon meet the audience. Lu Ming sings the song "Swallows in Pairs" and the theme song of "Elastic Daughter" in "Elastic Daughter," which is deeply moving. Her expression is so profound that she has the style of the Eastern Marlene Dietrich. She is truly a promising movie star.</p>
