<h3>火綫下的瑪德里（續）</h3>
<p>— 賓符譯</p>
<p>我們轉了灣；那裏又有一種震耳欲聾轟炸聲，屋簷磚塊夾着木頭和玻璃從一所公寓的巨厦崩下來橫在我們的路上，高過我們的頭約莫三百嗎。我們煞住了車，跑進門口去。一個炸彈落在地上嘶嘶的作聲。這使人全身都冷了。“那彈子會打中什麼地方呢？”我用力把門開了，想去找個比較可以躲避的地方，但是一陣風吹襲着門，這又使我縮住了。那炸彈從我們躲着的屋子炸裂到第三座屋子。同時候，另外一顆炸彈又落了下來。從其低輕的爆發聲，我猜想這是落在石砌的路上。半塊炸黑的花崗石，跳過屋頂落在那與我所站的門口相通的狹小的天井中，一個女人開了門，呌我們進去。“這樣的野蠻種！”她喊着。</p>
<p>幾分鐘內沒有炸彈。我們把門開了。沒有飛機的轉動聲。我們又回到了街上。一個武裝駕駛摩托脚踏車的人，要了我的車子去載運受傷的人們。他徵集着所有的汽車，作救護之用。不久，他們載運着沒有四肢的或炸毀半個臉孔的人們回去。在這個時候，誰都憤怒地恨着，那恨是永久的。</p>
<p>從許多炸毀的屋子的庭層中，女的，老的以及幼小的孩子們都開始爬了出來。什麼都是白的；白的頭髪，白的臉孔，白的衣服——都給紛碎的泥灰沾白了。一個十三歲的女孩子撫慰着龍中的一頭金絲雀。她的手臂下掛着一瓶牛奶。一個女人懷抱着嬰孩，兩個都顯得非常之妻慘，母親的衣服是黑的，她就在黑衣上面牽着孩子。一個皺紋重疊的老媼，裏了一條氈子，臉孔上的每絛皺紋，都不自主地戰抖着，她茫然地站在路上，而再三問着：“我到那裏去呢？”</p>
<p>我走了回來。川流似的無家可歸的人羣，漂泊在街頭，有的拿了一件外衣，有的拿了一包衣服，有的拿了一個孩子的睡褥。婦女們一羣一羣的站着，在失望的情調中，緊搓着她們的手，伸動着她們的腰。這樣的情形已經繼續了好幾個星期了。我一條街又一條街的跑着，街上沒有一扇玻璃窗是完整的。全部好像是一個地震過後的城市。然而人民都在那裏繼續生活着。“他們能到什麽地方去？”西班牙政府的資力都給戰爭吸盡了，没有運輸車或汽車，沒有充足的糧食和金錢，可以把瑪德里的市民搬開去，而外面又沒有援助來。響應比利時呼籲的世界那裏去了？天天跑到敎堂去禱告上帝的數百萬慈善的心腸那裏去了？自稱為唯心主義者而忙着他們自己的事業，修美容，上戲院的數百萬慈善的心肠，那裏去了？一個城市的文化和美麗，是快要埋葬於塵土中了！</p>
<p>我後來知道擔任這次空襲的是二十八架容克機和兩架：Capronis’機。那些勇敢的飛行者，知道他們是殺着無辜的婦孺和沒有戰鬥力的人們。他們已經這樣幹了幾個星期了：他們在這時候得到了很好的實習。他們受着柏林和羅馬的命令。他們的獨裁主人是崇拜恐怖的。當阿比西尼亞沒有攻下時，毒氣就立刻施放。那產生西萬第斯，未拉斯葵司（Velesquez)，哥雅（Goya）和愛爾格蘭哥（E1Grcc）的民族，是正遭受着塞拉西的黑戰士所受過的同樣殘酷的待遇。西歐也不會有較好命運的。</p>
<p>在西班牙，世界兩大勢力正在角鬥着。法西斯主義者第一個輪送了飛機和軍火去。現在他們又是第一個派遺了軍隊去。他們的潛水艇以及其他軍艦偵探着西班牙政府艦隊在東部各海港的動靜。他們的無恥是無可比擬的，因為英法曾在許多地方——阿比西尼亞，萊茵河——向他們表示大胆者是終可以獲得勝利的。民主外交不是驕橫的法國斯的敵手。如果弗蘭哥是勝利了，歐洲立刻要變成黑色，或者，一當希特勒和墨沙里尼備戰完成，歐洲將陷入於戰爭。瑪德里也許要陷落，也許不至於陷落。這還不能算是終點。在納佛爾（Navarre），在阿斯杜里亞，在阿拉貢（Aragon）政府軍曾獲得重要的軍事勝利。政府軍還正向着敵軍的中心太拉維拉（Talaqera）進逼。農民的怠工，工入的反抗搖動着弗蘭哥的後方。據俘虜者的報告，他正在雇用着無訓練的摩爾人，因為後備兵是告竭了，而西班牙人是不願為他戰爭的。</p>
<p>事情還沒有到决定的時候。這次事情也許要延長到比任何人現在所想像還長遠吧。（完）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本新閣的難產</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>日本廣田內閣因受議會的猛烈攻擊而提出辭職後。皇室卽任命宇垣大將組織新閣但宇垣自從二十四日拜受組閣大命以來迄今已有四日之久組閣工作非惟毫無頭緒。而且似有流產之勢。新閣難產的主要原因。自然是由於軍部方面的堅強反對。</p>
<p>軍部方面反對宇垣組閣的原因。表面上是說幾個有候補陸相資格的將校都拒絕按受陸相的職務但實際上却是因為他們不滿意於宇垣的態度所以不願意推薦繼任陸相。藉使宇垣內閣不能組成。至其所提出之無人繼任的理由實不過是一種推避責任的手段軍部對於宇垣的不滿是因為他抱着較為自由的思想與政黨方面有相當的關係同時並為日本陸軍自二十一師團裁减至十七師團的負責者有着這樣一段歷史的宇垣自然要被堅主積極向外發展而以充實國防為第一要義的軍部所反對。過去數天宇垣雖用各種方法去求軍部的諒解但軍部的堅决態度仍沒有絲毫改變因此宇垣所遇到的難關似極難打開現在橫在宇垣面前的去路不是知難而退。提出辭職。就是採用非常的方法。所調非常的方法。一方面是由宇垣去與有候補陸相資格者作私人的接洽。勸其接受陸相職務。待得其同意後。再由軍部方面推薦另一方面是奏請日皇。以皇室勢力責命有候補資格者担任陸相職務。不過據二十七日宇垣的表示。他並不擬採取這種非常的方法。也許這位六十七歲的老將。另有打破這個難關的法寶罷。事實究竟如何。只有看此後數天內形勢的發展了。</p>
<p>我們現在且不去論宇垣新閣的能否組成而僅來一述此後日本政治的動向。很明顯的。這次閣潮解决以後。軍部在政治上的勢力必將大形增加。在較早的时候。軍部在政治上是沒有什麽大勢力的。但自五•一五事變以後。軍人干政的現象日益普遍。到了最近。軍部的勢力更為雄厚。廣田內閣固然是全在軍部的勢力影響之下。卽此後成立的新閣。也必要爲軍部所左右。因為不是軍部所贊成的閣𢲕。或不受軍部勢力左右的閣𢲕。在最初組閣的時候。就會受到軍部的反對。不推荐繼任陸相。而使內閣無從產生。這種方法如果繼續的任意施用。則必使內閣成為軍部的工具。也就是說。一切政權將全由軍部支配。這樣一來。法西斯政制之在遠東出現。大概是沒有疑問的。</p>
<p>日本政治的右傾化。對於我國民族的復興。當然有極大的妨害。所以我們很希望這次日本政潮激結的結果。能够保持憲政的常道。要是不然的話。那我們只有更進一步的加緊大規模的精誠團結工作去應付未來遠東局勢的大演變而爭取民族的獨立與自由</p>

<h3>宇垣組閣成敗現臻微妙階段</h3>
<p>欲晤陸軍三長官未果仍謂擬為最後之努力</p>
<p>［東京］宇垣親信今井田清德、今晨訪晤寺內、寺內當告以陸軍態度未變、宇垣欲晤陸軍三長官、實於事無甚裨益云、但宇垣不顧一切、今午仍在籌劃最好方策、以冀打破目前之難局、惟是否有何成效、則無人能斷定、目前一般確信、宇垣舍辭卸組閣使命外、別無他途可循者較前益衆、此次陸軍態度之强硬、雖出一般人意料之外、而宇垣之不願輕易放棄閣計畫、亦使人驚異不置、宇垣自拜受組閣大命以來、已四日於茲、除訪問寺內•永野•湯淺外、足不出戶、態度閒逸、誠為極端罕有之事、再者政局雖不安定、而高級官員勘有會商、政黨亦均守緘默、意在避免增劇政治上之種種糾紛及困難、俾可解决目前內閣之危機、此亦為日本發生任何政治變化時未有之現象、（廿八日中央社電）</p>
<p>［東京］一般人僉恐局勢無趨好轉之餘地、陸軍方面認為宇垣組閣、終必歸於流產、陸軍次官梅津向報界發表談話、謂渠信宇垣苟確係偉大之政治家、則應拜辭組閣大命、並謂陸軍全部、對宇垣個人表示反對、因此殊無聽取宇垣政策之必要云、（二十八日中央社電）</p>
<p>［東京］據陸軍意見、軍部對宇垣大將已經迭次說明部內情形、宇垣大將雖要求三長官與其會見、然陸軍態度决不致有任何變化、陸軍之肅軍工作、現已就緒、部內如有彼此反目等事、則不利於兩方、宇垣大將應察知此間情形、而拜辭大命、為其最善方法云、（二十八日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］百武侍從長•實佐美侍從武官長•湯淺內府等今晨八時至九時之間、陸續進宮、（二十八日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］宇垣大將二十八日午後七時五十分在組閣本部語人云、時局現已到達最緊要之情勢、自着手組閣以來、業經相當時日但關於打開之途徑、旣已苦心至此、自當努力於最後之奉公云、（二十八日同盟電）</p>
<h3>考慮二三方法</h3>
<p>不願再事遷延　不候軍部答覆</p>
<p>［東京］今井田清德二十八日午後二時半在組閣本部發表談話云、宇垣大將與陸軍當局會見之舉、目下恐無此事、又今日中是否入宮、目下亦無何等决定、余無為宇垣大將之使者訪問何處、或從外部請人之豫定、關於遷延不决之事、正在愼重考慮、極願不使事實遷延、現在我等仍如前言、正在考慮所有一切之事、惟具體的不能有所表示、寺內陸相與余會見後、外部的事情雖無何等變化、然陸相與余會見之結果、於曾經種種考慮之方法之中、已有二三方法、在考慮之中、至我等是否再向陸軍當局活動、宇垣大將之心境、是否與余會見寺內陸相前相同、或有變化、如我等不再向陸軍當局活動、事態是否如此繼續、凡此數點、均在非常微妙之狀態、不能有所表示、惟無待軍部當局回答之事、則可以奉告、又是否有得陸相之希望、亦不能奉告云、（二十八日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］今井田清德二十八日上午十時訪寺內陸相於其官邸、述宇垣大將仍望與三長官會見之旨、寺內陸相答稱、二十六日三長官會議之結果、曾答覆在案、其情形雖至今日仍無變更、縱令三長官與宇垣大將會見、深信難副貴意、蓋陸軍態度依然强硬、縱令會見、亦無效果云、話畢、今井田卽回組閣本部、發表談話云、頃奉宇垣大將之命、往訪寺內陸相、然其內容目下不能奉告、宇垣大將是否能再晤寺內陸相、尚未决定與陸軍之關係、不能謂與昨日有特別變更之情勢、亦無待前途回答之事、余僅為使者而往、是否有何結果、不能明以奉告、陸相恐無回答之事、奉命往訪陸相以外之陸軍首腦部之人、目下亦無此豫定云、（二十八日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］宇垣大將之組閣參謀長今井田清德、二十八日午後八時在組閣本部與記者團之問答情形如左、</p>
<p>問•大局是否轉至拜辭之方向、</p>
<p>答•現除宇垣大將所發表之心境以外、未便作答、</p>
<p>問•此外尚有打開時局之希望否、</p>
<p>答•此事正在苦心中、但現在當不至再請假以時日、</p>
<p>問•今晚預定外出否、</p>
<p>答•宇垣大將與余均未預定外出、外間亦無人應邀來此、</p>
<p>問•現在尚未採取非常手段乎、</p>
<p>答•盡量由光明正大以謀解决問題、决不欲採取非常手段、</p>
<p>問•如組閣不成、則不能收拾時局、是否考慮及此</p>
<p>答•雖未作如是想、但以時局極形嚴重、故組閣成功當為最後之奉分、無論如何、須竭力保持協調以圖圓滿成立耳、</p>
<p>問•所謂協調方法、大致已歸烏有、其奈之何、</p>
<p>答•大致如此、但協調手段尚不無殘留、及至用盡時為止、俾竭最後之努力、當認為係宇垣大將之責任也、</p>
<p>問•對於陸軍之折衝是否告終、</p>
<p>答•現在恐不至再與陸軍商議也云云、（二十八日同盟電）</p>
<h3>法理解决</h3>
<p>事實上難行</p>
<p>［東京］宇垣大將二十七日會見湯淺政府、報告組閣困難情形後、復與今井田清德協議善後、鑒於時局嚴重、决意完成组閣、而認此乃最適當措置、關於完成組閣之方針、以得繼任陸相之候選人為先决條件、於是宇垣决定本日會見寺內前陸相與杉山總監、或在三長官合會席上、懇請推薦候補陸相、而與陸軍合作、以協力的態度、擬開難關、（二十八日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］組閣本部、因陸軍態度始終强硬、無法施行、特於二十六與二十七兩日、邀請法制局長官次田大三郞、協議法理的解决方法、又於二十八日上午十時、招請次田長官、關於選任陸軍大臣之事、為法制上之研究、惹起一般之注目、其結果將如次法理的解釋、</p>
<p>㊀據內閣官　制第九條規定、各省大臣如有故障、他省大臣臨時兼任、或奉命管押事務、依此法交之解釋、當於組閣時、命他省大臣管理陸相事務、並非違法、</p>
<p>㊁陸軍三長官　旣然通告推舉繼任陸相者之不可能、宇垣大將不經三長官之推薦、而直接與其意中人物交涉、選任為陸相、在法制上可能、</p>
<p>第一項辦法雖非違法、因事關於軍部、實際上不能適用、第二項理論雖有可能性、然就實際問題而論、如無軍部諒解、任命陸相、則部內統制難保持、故宇垣似仍與軍部交涉以謀解决、（二十八日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］陸軍當局根基於三長官會議之决定、對於宇垣大將發出正式答覆、寺內前陸相認陸軍與宇垣大將組閣折衡、以此完結最後手段、而對於今後發展情形、不置任何期望、並認今後正待解决之問题、為宇垣大將拜辭大命後發生困難事態、應如何圓滿收拾、又視宇垣內閣之流產、不過為時期問題、宇垣大將已失陸軍協力、今後以何種方法進行現閣、據一部所傳其方法如次、</p>
<p>㊀由陸軍三長官推舉候補陸相以外之大將、或中將中物色人物、請求入閣、</p>
<p>㊁改正現行官制、俾預備軍及後備軍之大將或中將、亦得就任陸相、</p>
<p>㊂特使預備及後備軍之大將或中將、復歸現役軍人、以使入閣、</p>
<p>㊃優詔降下於軍部大臣時、寺內陸相留任、</p>
<p>但此種方法、實際上殊難實現、如宇垣大將勉强實施此法、則將發生殊堪憂慮之事態、亦未可知、又有一說、文官代理陸相掌管軍政務、然此種手段對於宇垣係極危險之事、據陸軍意見、宇垣大將為其名譽、决不願考慮如此手段、如斯宇垣大將之組閣工作、因軍部之强硬反對逢着致命的障硬、故其流產始不可避免云、（二十八日同盟電）</p>
<h3>德奧成立經濟協定</h3>
<p>貿易數量大增</p>
<p>［維也納］外長史密德頃與德國公使巴本簽訂德奧兩國經濟協定、其大要規定、㊀奧國農產品、尤其是牲口•牛油•牛乳•木材•以及冶金業所需器具、輸出德國數量應予增加、㊁德奧兩國獎勵人民相互往來遊歷、㊂德國所產之煤與工業製造品輸出奧國數量、應予增加、關於此事、官方發表公報稱、依照此項協定、德奧相互貿易數量將大為增加云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［維也納］德奧經濟協定簽字之後、外傳德國擬以航空機械供給奧國、作為抵賬之用、此間政界人士頃宣稱、此說卽使屬實、德國所可供給之航空機械亦必有限、緣德奧兩國經濟協定對於雙方抵賬辦法、訂有一定限度、其數目並非巨大故也云、（二十八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>宇垣大將好整以暇</h3>
<p>［東京］嘗深刻之苦惱蟄居組閣本部樓上之宇垣大將、朝餐後下樓、到內庭散步、見梅花盛開、悠然有感、旋為新聞記者團所包圍、問以“情形如何”、答云、余早晚散步、以此為樂、組閣以來、閉居樓上、未曾運動、因此腹覺飽滿、飲食乏味、頭亦因此而重、雖余亦苦難得名案、惟組閣之志、絕不少懈、時勢旣已如此、余之堅持、或者有濟、旋話頭一轉、謂“余又抱孫”矣、由組閣一轉而思及安產男孩之二女秀子、憂色似又稍减、大將繼謂、“孫之命名殊難、其取組閣二字乎”、繼又曰此戲言耳、果爾必為余女所怨也、言訖大笑不止、旋周遊國內一遍、登樓而去、（二十八日同盟社電）</p>
<h3>國聯閉幕法土協定成立</h3>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯會行政院第九十六届常會今晚八時舉行最後一次公開會議、以結束各項問題、行政院主席卽中國駐法大使顧維鈞、當於八時四十分宣佈本屆常會正式閉會、至於本屆常會所討論各案、除叙利亞境內散嘉克區域土耳其少数民族問題業經解决外、本日行政院所决定者、尚有但澤自由市高級委員繼任人選問題、及西班牙京城各國使館內所收容難民撤退問題、關於第一問題、行政院午後舉行非公開會議時、曾由英國外相艾登提出報告、主張仍由英法瑞典三國代表所組織之委員會、繼續注視但澤自由市局勢之發展并提議以荷蘭前任海軍參謀總長德格拉夫中將為國聯會駐但澤自由市高級委員、以繼前任高級委員萊斯脫之職、如德格拉夫中將不願就職、則由三國委員會協同行政院主席曁波蘭代表、另行指派之、此項報告書、當經行政院公開會議予以核准、關於第二問題、本日午後、行政院非公開會議中、已由西班牙與智利兩國代表成立折衷辦法、嗣後關於瑪德里城南美洲各國使館內所收容難民之撤退問題當由西班牙駐英大使阿斯加拉德、及南美各國駐英大使公使在倫敦舉行直接談判、以解决之、此項决定、亦經行政院公開會議、予以備案、至是、行政院工作完全告竣、各國代表當卽相率離開日內瓦、法國外長台爾博斯、亦已於今晚啟程遄返巴黎矣、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［日內瓦］叙利亞境內亞歷山特萊德與安蒂沃希兩城土耳其少數民族問題、業經法國與土耳其成立協定、並由報告員瑞典外長散特婁起草報告書、提交國聯會行政院核議、本日午後、行政院開會時、當將該報告書提付表决、一致通過、茲摘述解决辦法如下、</p>
<p>㊀亞歷山特萊德與安蒂沃希兩城、卽所謂散嘉克區域、對於內政享有完全自主權利、惟對外事務、則由敘利亞國主持之、又該區域貨幣制度及關稅制度、亦應與叙利亞相同</p>
<p>㊁散嘉克區域內應以土耳其語為正式語文、至在何種條件之下、方可使用他種語文、則日後當由國聯會行政院另行决定之、</p>
<p>㊂叙利亞國凡在國際方面採取任何步驟、而與散嘉克區域之內政自主權有關者、概須先經國聯會之明白核准而後可、</p>
<p>㊃叙利亞與散嘉克區域、當由專員担任聯絡、</p>
<p>㊄國聯會行政院指派法國籍代表一人、保證散嘉克區域行政制度之實施、該代表對於散嘉克立法機關之决議、有權决定停止實施、但以停止四個月為限度、</p>
<p>㊅散嘉克區域、不駐軍隊、並禁止在該區域內實行義務兵役制、及建築軍事工程、</p>
<p>㊆法土兩國應於日後訂立條約、俾由兩國共同保障散嘉克區域之領土完整、及叙利亞現有邊界之不可侵犯性、</p>
<p>㊇訂立特殊條欵、規定耳其得在亞歷山特萊德港享有惠權益、</p>
<p>㊈散嘉克區域行政制度、經國聯會行政院三分之二之多數通過後、當立卽發生效力、法國並保證此項制度之實施、至該國對於叙利亞委任統治任期告終之時為止、</p>
<p>本日行政院會議審核上項報告書時、土耳其外長魯舒第•法國外長台爾博斯•均聲稱、此項新協定、足使法土兩國間友誼、愈益密切、羅馬尼亞外長恩多奈斯哥•英國外相艾登•蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫•亦相繼發言、對於法土兩國成立協定、表示欣慰、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法借欵談判</h3>

<p>［莫斯科］今日蘇俄著名新聞家拉狄克、及其他前任蘇維埃高級官吏十六名被控案、繼續審訊時、拉氏預言本年之內、日俄兩國將有戰事發生、據拉氏供稱、彼曾由前任重工業副人民委員長畢塔柯夫氏處、接獲特羅資基之來電、內稱已與德國設法進行掀起此種戰事、大約所預定之時期、卽在一九三七年之中、拉氏續稱、據畢氏語彼、德方對於外交上之準備、需時一年、惟其軍事準備則已告完成、德方願英國保守中立、並要求在多瑙流域及巴爾幹、得完全自由行動云、前任蘇俄鐵道局長之克那齊夫氏對於上事、亦有所供述、謂日人所持之意見、與拉氏供辭中所提及者、頗相吻合云、</p>
<p>［莫斯科］關於反革命“平行中心”案、最高法院軍事法庭昨日訊問被告克尼亞才夫、當據供稱、余曾組織特羅資基派反革命機關、並在烏拉爾省南部破壞鐵路、計一九三四年間該路失事一千五百起、一九三五年失事兩千起、余並於一九三四年間為日本間諜機關出力、並將另一被告萊夫希士（曾任南方鐵路局局長曁交通人民委員會副委員）所授予之秘密情報、供給該機關、迨至一九三六年、日本間諜某移居莫斯科、當令余將毒菌隱於陸軍糧食庫、而酬以一萬五千盧布、另一被告賴戴却克供稱、余奉被告庇亞塔可夫之命、曾將若干化學工廠加以炸燬、並與德國間諜機關保持聯絡、至是十七被告審訊完畢、堂上當卽禁止旁聽、而命各專家提出報告、據稱、各該鐵路機關車損壤、與各工廠爆炸情事均甚輕微、此乃各被告對於破壞工作敷衍了事所致云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］據傳蘇俄布爾希維克領袖特羅資基之次子塞杜夫、現充克拉斯納約斯克工廠之工程師、因被控謀毒殺該廠工人、已於今日被捕、官方關於此舉繋未有正式佈告、但克拉斯納約斯克工廠工人所通過之决議案、可認為事實上之證據、該决議案中聲稱、“法斯西黨爪牙特羅資基之子塞杜夫、圖用毒瓦斯以殲最後一團之工人、吾輩已申請最高法院誅滅此輩特派之蝥賊、”（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>墨西哥　特羅資基今日述及其次子塞杜夫在俄被捕事、謂此為一種報復行動、入獄後、大約將受不堪忍之慘刑、此種行動、實為史丹林之本性、余之二女已死於其手矣、特氏又在報上發表一文、聲明莫斯科公審前蘇俄高級官員十七人所作之供詞、全出揑造、與空間時間均不相符云、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈初跌繼則反漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌四六七角不等坎拿大跌七八角利物浦跌一便士零、故開價時一、各月份人心、會見不振本月份低至八角八分三四月份亦較跌一二分、惟過此之後、市氣復見高振、因多頭未吐、天津帮又略有現貨生意、故買氣較盛、近期回漲二三分、遠期尚定、迨至下午開盤，本月份因客戶拉進、三四月份則圈子帮補空、市氣頗佳、不過結賬日近、交易有限、此種畸形之進展、恐不能持久云、</p>

<p>銀行公會發表全文</p>
<p>第七條　行員應按日繳納薪額百分之二之乙種保證金、於每月發薪時、照數扣存、</p>
<p>（說明）行員旣無保人、甲種保證金及利息之一部、又須發還、故本條規定之乙種保證金、性質殆近於信用保險之保險費、全體行員、自有繳納之必要、百分之二之比率、亦屬極低、將來倘無舞弊發生、尚可將本金照數攤還、（參閱第一八條）是保證之中、猶寓儲蓄之意、假定全年薪金總額一百六十萬元、則此項保證金估計、年可得三萬一千餘元、</p>
<p>此項保證金、原擬規定為按照行員薪額之高下累進徵繳、惟為求整齊劃一起見、採比例制、規定一律百分之二、其已辦理行員儲蓄之銀行、可將此項儲蓄金之一部份撥充、</p>
<p>第八條　按月扣存之乙種保證金應由服務所在行處、將各戶細數、填列行員乙種保證金清單、連同欵項、解交總行、由總行專戶存儲、利息按年息一分二釐計算、每半年複利一次、撥充行員保證準備金、</p>
<p>（說明）本條規定、各行處將各員生扣存之乙種保證金、分別塡列細數係便於核算、並為集中管理起見、規定必須彙解總行、以杜流弊、所給利息、亦特予提高、為一分二釐、以期充實保證準備金、</p>
<p>第九條　總行應將行員乙種保證金、分別設立行員乙種保證金分戶賬、於每年年終、彙計一次、逐戶填發乙種保證金通知書、不另給摺據、</p>
<p>（說明）乙種保證金、本金全部或餘額將來擬予發還、自應設立分戶賬以便計算年終發給通知收、難是手續問題、但亦可提醒行員、重視乙種保證金之利益、收互相監督廓清舞弊之效、</p>
<p>第十條　本行每年撥發行員丙種保證金若干萬元、其數額由行方核定、專戶存儲利息按年一分二釐計算、每半年複利一次、</p>
<p>（說明）行方因行員舞弊、而蒙受損失、事所難免、以本行而論、歷年所受此項損失、為數不貲、平時如無相當準備、臨時不免窮於應付且行員舞弊行方亦不無責任、故規定每年撥發若干萬元、作為丙種保證金、此係行方行政權限、故由行方核定、以示與行員合作甘苦與共之意</p>
<p>第十一條　總行應設立行員保證金戶、於每年年終將左列三欵、收入該戶存儲、充行員保證準備金、</p>
<p>㊀行員甲種保證金利息之半數、</p>
<p>㊁行員乙種保證金之本息、</p>
<p>㊂行員丙種保證金之本息、</p>
<p>（說明）為集中保證力量起見、故將三項保證金合併存儲、假定全年薪金總額為一百六十萬元、計年可得十一萬餘元、卽有舞弊案件、亦足應付、</p>
<p>本條第一二兩項規定、以全體行員之甲種保證金利息半數、及乙種保證金本息、提充保證準備金、如遇舞弊案件發生、除照第十二條規定辦理外、如或不足、卽照第十三條規定、以之抵償損失、表面上似將不舞弊者之保證金、賠償舞弊者之損失、實則此係危險分擔”、原定之運用、性質略同於信用保險之保險費、惟保險費、無論有無舞弊、均須繳納、而不發還、本規則保證準備金、如無舞弊、或賠償舞弊損失而有餘額時、尚可發還、更覺此善於彼耳、</p>
<p>第十二條　行員應負賠償責任時、除刑事部份、應由服務行處愼重處理、無須請示、並不得徇情、立卽將該違法之行員就近送交法院、依法辦理、並同時報告總行外、其應賠價之金頗、以左列各欵清償之、</p>
<p>一、該員甲種保證金本息、</p>
<p>二、該員乙種保證金本息、</p>
<p>三、該員儲金本息、</p>
<p>四、該員其他在職應得之利益、</p>
<p>五、該員所有之一切財產、</p>
<p>（說明）本條前半段規定、服務行處、應將舞弊行員依法從嚴懲辦、為防其潛逃起見、應由各該行處、無須請示、並不得徇情、立卽將該違法行員、就近交法院依法辦理、並同時報告總行、至足以撥充賠償金之欵項、多至五種、以之彌補損失、諒不致過於短缺、</p>
<p>第十三條遇行員應負賠償責任、而前條規定各欵、不足清償時、其不足之額、以本規則第十一條規定之全體行員之三種保證準備金、照接成比例計算法撥償之、</p>
<p>（說明）因乙種保證金之徵繳、等於信用保險之保險費、（見第十八條說明）原為預備抵償行員本人或其他同人舞弊損失之用、如有餘額、則按照本規則第十八條之規定、方予發還、惟為平均分担起見、故動用第十一條之三種保證準備金時、規定按成比例分配、以昭公允、所謂比例分配者茲試舉例如次、</p>
<p>假定每年可以動用之保證準備金如左、</p>
<p>佔總數種類金額元之百分比甲項利息　二四•○○○　三之半數乙項本息　三二•○○○　二九丙項本息　五六•○○○　五○共計一三•○○○　一○○</p>
<p>再假定發生一舞弊案件損失額為動用保證準備金百分之十、則甲乙丙三項準備金、各提出百分之十、以資彌補、卽甲項二千四百元、乙項三千二百元、丙項五千六百元、合計為一萬一千二百元、分析此一萬一千二百元之來源、半數出自行方、不可謂非行方决心推行新制之表示、愛護行員不謂不週、（未完）</p>

<p>十三海里　其特別設備、則有自動測水器尋向器以及防盜器具等、其他設備亦均臻上乘、而為現時滬上中外各海輪所不及、輪中各種艙位、佈置新潔適宜、頭等艙位、裝有電扇暖氣汀冷氣櫃及浴室等等、二•三等艙位內設備大致相同、四等艙位則均為帆布床地位亦極</p>
<p>寬暢清潔　至海亨輪船長為馬家駿精明强幹、經騐豐富、並曾領得航海甲等證書、且般上員工服務經騐宏富、因該新輪機件引擎、均屬最新式、故該局曾派熟悉機務人員赴英實地練習駕駛技術與輪機引擎管理等事、務期精益求精所有勤務生（卽舊稱茶房）亦均訓練有素故在員工服務方面觀之、可使乘客感到便利舒適而滿意也、</p>

<h3>七指人</h3>
<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>吃了酒過後，第二天爬起來，精神頹唐，眼睛紅紅的，一面打哈欠，一面就罵吃酒吃肉的出家人，沒道德，死去定會墮地獄，罵得聽的人都高興笑了，他也就十分神清氣爽起來，快快樂樂去做點事情。倘若這天沒有人聽，無處可罵，便直像倒了霉似的打哈欠打到晚上。——這人便是清如師，一個不大住廟子，專喜遊方的和尚、手指頭只有七根的。</p>
<p>我和他相識，而且處得很久，是在路邊的一個息客店里。發現他這種古怪脾氣的時候，我就嘲笑他道：</p>
<p>“你簡直在罵你自家哪！聽我勸，你還是悄悄迷迷地，喝酒吃肉好。”</p>
<p>他經我一提，有些不好意思起來，囁嚅道：</p>
<p>“我不罵，我心里就不好過呀！”</p>
<p>隨卽將掻着光腦殼的手，憎惡地往外一揮，他那愛罵人的脾氣又發作了。</p>
<p>“像我這樣的東西，還不該常常挨罵的麼？我就願意你們指着我的鼻子罵頓，可是你們都鴨子的足板，一聯兒的，口是心非、再不然、就當面恭維背面笑。使我悶在肚子裹，好不難過。你要曉得一個人明白他做了錯事了，卻又沒法子改過來，那就只有挨頓罵才好過哪。你不要說，讓我告訴你吧，善書上有這麼一段故事，你聽見過沒有？說是一個人偷人家的雞吃了，便長了一身雞毛，拔也拔不掉，使勁扯呢，又痛得要命！那怎麼辦呢？簡直沒有辦法，羞得來不好見人。後恰來巧遇個和尚，那是已有半仙之份了，絕不像我這樣的東西，酒呀肉地，還要嫖。就告訴他，說他偷雞偷得不妙，剛好碰着善人了，半句也沒罵過，咒過，所以他這邊的罪，便沒處低消，只得全背在身上。如果要雞毛拔得掉，最好到善人那裏去，叩個頭，說你錯偷了雞，以後再不敢了，並央求他罵你一頓。這偷雞賊謝過了和尚，便趕快去做。哪知那個善人，才眞善得很，無論如何不願罵一句。後來苦苦央求，又把和尚的話，告訴了他，說他罵人一頓，也算做件好事。這才答允了。事情不親眼看過，也許你不相信，眞是怪得很，才沒罵到兩句，雞毛便開始一根根，自行落下地去。……所以，看起來，世間上最厲害的，便是吃了虧，不還手，不回罵哪。”</p>
<p>罵到這裏，他那渾濁的眼睛，也變得清明有光起來，嘴角上自然更不會流露打哈欠的影子了。至於這種故事，在我看來，只是打胡亂說，不值一駁的。然而在他那面，我明白，這却造成了他的人生哲學，而且竟作為了日常解除罪惡的根據了。因此，找就議諷他道：</p>
<p>“照你往天罵的話看來，我老早就奇怪，你為啥就不怕墮地獄？原來你才是懂得這個法門兒！嚇。”</p>
<p>他臉紅了，不服地辯道：</p>
<p>“你嘴巴眞刻毒！我是沒辦法，才這樣的哪。要是先曉得才來幹壞事，那我又何必要做和尚呢？（接着舉起那只有三根指頭的左手）又何苦這樣燃指獻佛呢？”</p>
<p>自然我諒解他，承認他之所以這樣，原必另有苦衷的，但表面上還是嘲弄他道：</p>
<p>“看嘛，你就不服了！剛才你不還是抱怨別人不罵你嗎？才這樣幾句話，就說人家刻毒，那誰還敢指着鼻子罵你呢？”</p>
<p>於是，他不好意思地搔着光腦殼，口吃地笑着道：</p>
<p>“人就是這樣混帳的東西哪。總不能依照心意做去的，自家都要搗蛋的。自家先前我蹬廟子的時候做師傅的，天天罵我打我，那還不好嗎？啥子吃酒吃肉的罪，都消除了。可是，道理是這樣說，人總是人，不是紙紮的，所以，到底我還是溜開，跑出來過這遊方化緣的日子。起初還自由自在，後來覺得這樣拖下去，罪惡會更加深重的，便又一天一天地不好受起來，就打算再跑回廟子去。讓那老和尚罵一頓好，可是一想到他罵的那一股兇勁兒，誰還願意自家去觸霉頭呢？這一來我就只好自家罵自家了。”</p>
<p>我笑道：</p>
<p>“其實我聽見的，你到是句句都在罵別個吃喝嫖賭的和尚嘛。”</p>
<p>他拉一拉他的圓領大衣說道：</p>
<p>“難道我自己是把這個掉了的麼？”</p>
<p>“不要說了，老滑頭，我曉得的，你一面做老和尚罵人，又一面做小和尚吃喝嫖賭，因而是兩得其便，寫意得很！”</p>
<p>他見我這樣刻薄他，他搖着光腦殼，痛苦地說道：</p>
<p>“朋友，我還沒有壞到這步田地哪，我還沒有壞到這步田地哪。”</p>
<p>隨卽自家責備自家地嘆息道：</p>
<p>“唉，該挨罵的！該挨罵的！”</p>
<p>我便莊重地說道：</p>
<p>“看起來你這人當初就不該出家的，實在是把路走錯了。”</p>
<p>“不！”他也很莊重地回答，舉一舉他那指頭不全的手，“當初就覺得這一條路對！你知道我這根手指頭會怎樣沒有的，（拿右手二指，點一下左手的么指）就是我爸罵出來的哪。我才偷着賭幾回錢，他就跳起足地罵我，把我罵得好不傷慘，我氣不過了，便拖把菜刀來，紅不說白不說，就宰下我的指頭。當時，他老人家還很失悔，說是不賭就算了，何必這樣呢？”</p>
<p>我也失聲道：</p>
<p>“你眞做得太過火。”</p>
<p>“過火！你不曉得哪，我當時，心里像有一盆火在燒一樣，不這樣做，他簡直會把人罵死呀。等到他失悔，我才大大好過了，就是看見指頭上，血不住地冒，也覺得這是做得痛快的。誰知後來呢，我自己眞是該死的傢伙，才不到一年，我又偷着打牌擲骰了，你不要笑，也許你處到我那樣田地，也說不定會那樣去幹的。我告訴你嘛，我爸的辦法眞是太要不得了，成天把我釘在家里，左也怕我花錢，右也怕我花錢，連到縣去讀書的學費，也不肯出，就是這樣地吝嗇！你想一個年青青的小夥子，怎能老悶在家里，不死不活地過下去呢？這一來，毛病便來了，起先是偷偷地散悶一兩回，到後來就越發爛了，籣直把先前宰指頭的事情，志記得一乾二凈。等到我爸查出我，偷出許多錢，都輸掉了，便氣得要死要活起來。開始是結結實實打我一頓，後來便要趕我出門。親戚家屬來勸，也不聽，說我就是宰下一雙手膀，他也不相信我會換面洗心的。我自己呢，看一看宰過的指頭，覺得就是要决必改過，自家也不敢有啥把握了。這一來，我只有去出家，聽憑菩薩把我怎樣處置。……你不要笑，找當初一進廟子去，看見到處都是乾乾凈凈的，我就相信，我會好起來。早晚聽見鐘聲的聲音，都有說不出來的喜歡。一直住下兩年，沒出廟子一步過，成天全在唸佛修行。我還想，要是我爸，那個老東西，走來看見，還敢說不二不三的話嗎？自己着實得意。哪知我們這些沒命根子的，到底成不了佛。……唉。”</p>
<p>說到這里，他深深地嘆息了，我催他之後，才又繼續說下去。</p>
<p>“就是有一天廟子做啥子會，來了不少的居士婆婆，居士奶奶。我才大大詫異了，為啥子先前一向見慣了的少女嫩婦，是那樣令人……唉。”</p>
<p>他不好意思地紅起臉來。</p>
<p>“第二天，廟子重復清靜了，我却不安起來，簡直連敲鐘應敲幾下，都忘記了。掃地的時候，看見階邊青苔上，昨天留下的足印，也有些出神，不忍把牠掃去。成天就想到外面去走走。小溝邊上，那些從來不大留心的紅綠野花兒，也使我非常記掛起來。甚至連照在廟子里的太陽光，也覺得沒田地上的亮些，好看些。一天一天地，我連從前喜歡聽的鐘聲聲音，喜歡聞的檀香味道，都討厭得要命。我把這情形，偷偷告訴一個老和尚，他才說我中了魔了。我問他有沒有解救的法子？他說有是有的，只是苦一點，便是要燃指獻佛。</p>
<p>一面就舉起左手來，一面繼續說下去。</p>
<p>一看哪，我的第四指，就是這樣完了的。當時眞是痛得鑽心入骨，頭也發昏，啥子邪念頭都沒有了。後來呢，指頭好了，哼，邪念還是鑽了進來。這一來，一切便完了。</p>
<p>唉，我是該挨罵的！我是該挨罵的！”</p>
<p>他那頹唐樣子深深打動了我，便替他打算道：</p>
<p>“其實你儘可以還俗哪！難道你還怕別人罵你嗎？”</p>
<p>“罵我到不怕，其實我到願意人家罵的。就是這張皮害了我，披了十多年，弄成個肩不能挑手不能拿的東西了。”</p>
<p>他一面感慨地說，一面舉起右手理他的衣衫。</p>
<p>我為見他右手的么指，也是缺了的，我想問這又是什麼原故，但我却怕更引起他的痛苦，便不再問了。</p>
<p>讀書隨筆</p>
<h3>愷撒和羣衆</h3>
<p>— 南宮離</p>
<p>我曾經看過“僑蘇外工出版聯合社”出版的却派耶夫的英譯本，也曾經看過由這書的原本改編而成的，中文名字譯為夏伯陽的電影，這故事所給我的印象，前後兩次，是一致的：我驚異於表現在這史實裹的羣衆的力量。覺得他們懂利害，明是非，有着確切的取捨，决不像有些人所想像的那樣愚昧。而且我因此還想古今中外的羣衆，其實也並不一定愚昧的。某先生看了莎士比亞的愷撒傳，就休然於羣衆的“盲目”，“沒有理性”，并且由此决定自己“還需要一點做人的經騐”，這是過去的話柄了，時隔三年，現在是不是有了那樣的一經騐”，我不知道。然而，莎士比亞所描寫的古代羅馬的羣衆，雖然愚昧，其實是有理性的，他們也要認一認是非和利害，並不盲目，不過因為處身在黑暗裏，雖然開着眼睛，也仍舊一無所見而已。某先生只注意羣衆的五官，却忘記了愷撒的時代了。</p>
<p>然而，文章的重心，却並不在此。他還要比中國於羅馬“痛心”現在，“痛心”“近幾百年來”雞來迎雞，狗來迎狗、式的羣衆。“愚昧”，“盲目”，“沒有理性”，易被“煽動”，當然還是免不了的罪名。但是，我因此又想：某先生是忘記了事實的情形，忘記了愷撒式的制度所給予羣衆的壓制了。世界上决沒有這樣多的先天的低能見。</p>
<p>便是在古代的羅為，也沒有。</p>
<p>愛好自由，憎惡帝制的羅馬公民，在愷撒的治下，一批一批地被殺戮，被監禁，被驅逐了，終於只胇上一些灰色的，不敢有什麼希望的奴隸。因此，愷撒的背後，有着輔翼他的野心的軍隊；元老院裹的共和黨，却連一個後盾也沒有。這不是偶然的。對着關在籠子裏的禽鳥嘆氣，怪牠們不能遠飛的人們，是冷笑羣衆愚昧者的典型。</p>
<p>然而冷笑家以外，世上也還有熱心的志士。</p>
<p>紀元前四十四年，愷撒在元老院裹他的仇敵龐倍（Pompey　the　Gpeat）的雕像脚下，被刺殒命了。莎士比亞用着寫實的筆調、卓越的藝術手腕，描為出這個不可一世的英豪的末路。當初魯脫司（Marcas　Braws）跟着卡司卡（Casca）把刺刀戥過去時，愷撒驚異地喊：</p>
<p>“什麼，勃魯脫司，你也如此？那就讓我死吧！”</p>
<p>愷撒死了，羅馬的子民們重復有了自由和光明。不料在幾千年後的現在，愷撒式的制度却又復活過來，墨素里尼不是要重建一個羅馬帝國麼？倘說二十世紀的意大利人民都是“雞來迎雞，狗來迎狗”的羣衆班，我决不相信。</p>
<p>我也不相信中國只有這樣的羣衆。</p>
<p>卽就近事而論，關外的義勇軍的抗擊，國內的學生工人的救亡，充分表示着中國羣衆的有理性，不昧於是非。不過在客觀環境的限制下，有時不免消沈這並非他們本性的愚昧。</p>
<h3>克服</h3>
<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>關於盲人屬根怎樣克服了那瞧他不起的女書記裴帕西，一個善於交際，對於社會上的事情一無所知的女人，那故事是這樣的：</p>
<p>每個星期天的下午屬根到那些年輕人底集會裏演講。他穿了樸素的純白的西裝，結着黑色的領帶，鞋帽都選擇了輕淡的顏色，墨晶眼鏡過於沉滯了，他和女書記裴柏西到南京路選上了一對足以增加他底英俊的茶晶鏡片。青年學生坐下華麗的出租汽車來迎他。</p>
<p>“厲根先生——他們恭敬地鞠躬，腦袋歪歪扭扭，把手按在軍事訓練的制服的灰色硬鈕上。他們身上的骨骼都沒有發育完全，頭髪又長又參差，不馴服地直豎着，喜歡用兩個字做筆名而不肯告訴別人他底本姓。“坐下來，坐下來。”編輯家殷勤地向他們答禮，互相熱烈地握着手。</p>
<p>在講壇上那些貧窮的神秘的學生固樣沒有發育完全的嗓子偷偷地，耳語一般地說了幾句介紹的話就溜下來了。編輯家屬根聽見歡迎自己的掌聲就走開來沉着地彎一彎腰，站在壇上好像一尊非常嚴肅的石膏像。“可敬的青年諸君——國家底命脈，民族底元神諸君——這樣開始着。他以他底廣傳的知職侵人哲學，政治學以及一般社會問題底領域，他底語言被發現了從前所沒有的敏捷和精警。……末了他這樣說：</p>
<p>“正如我剛才所說的一樣，文學界也必然要以創造力旺盛的可敬的青年諸君做常備軍，把昏庸老朽的傢伙趕出去。我正在等候你們底驅逐！……我——在生理上有不可補償的缺憾，簡直和你們小蘇所講的話裏一樣：一個瞎子！我為了找底確信和每一個書店老板對抗着，可是該死的他們以偽青年人沒有資格做他們底商品，那些奴才！……”</p>
<p>坐在送他回家的車廂裏，他發現了自己那些並沒有充份準備而隨意說出的詞句恰好成了年輕人底熱烈的需要。他們長時間地鼓着掌，叫鬧着表示他們不能壓抑的歡快，把他圍繞着不讓他走出來。……他又昏亂又驚喜地整個人麻木掉了。女書記擔優地詢問他每次演講的結果怎樣，他只是微笑地點點頭而說不出確切的報告。</p>
<p>接受了裴柏西底要求，他把她帶到演講會裏。在青年人邊矜持地坐着，她親眼看見他們在發狂地嗜好着他，好像廣東的轎夫們嗜好着言歌者一樣。</p>
<p>“Bassre，請你給我起草一下，聽我說呀。”</p>
<p>她底臉紅了，心驚肉跳地接受了萬根底吩咐，過份謹愼地聽着他所說的每一個字，虔誠而勤勉地工作着。</p>
<p>於是有一天厲根肅然地對裴柏西說了。</p>
<p>“看我底成助，你看……！唉！可惜這不是你能够相信的。——一個嚴肅的奮鬥，我開始了——我已經下决心要做全中國的第一個人！…這個人，挽救了全體編輯家底人格！”</p>
<p>裴柏西像無端愛了重大的侮辱一般陷在苦惱的境地裏，不說話也不唱歌，沒有一點精神地懶散地走着路，她不相信厲根能做任何更好的事情但也不能抗拒他。</p>
<h3>想起戲劇</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>現在想寫到的是戲劇，但自己先就不知道是該承認懂得一點戲劇，抑或是承認一點也不懂。</p>
<p>有勇氣，也許五分鐘之後，可以自信是一個戲劇家。</p>
<p>第一分鐘，編一個戲本，</p>
<p>“幕啟，靜悄悄的空舞台上跑過一隻貓。幕落”。</p>
<p>這劇本不難在兩分鐘內造出導演與舞台監督。</p>
<p>還剩兩分鐘可以寫一篇劇評。申論一隻貓與一隻狗有什麼不同，因而中國的大大主義怎麼與意大利的，大大主義不同。</p>
<p>這樣，若成為戲家，自然太滑稽；但這樣而竟小成為戲家，也未免太悽慘。</p>
<p>在各方面都得將就的情形下，我們已有許多全才，又何必再多一個。</p>
<p>但要擠入全才堆中去，總要不被專家否認</p>
<p>不被專家否認的條件，實在以不關於戲本身的為多。</p>
<p>有關的，做手只有要承專家的理論或技巧的不可及。</p>
<p>沒有理論，沒有技巧，將是什麼戲劇？這問題正是留給專家施展本領的餘地。</p>
<p>有時候專家也得試兼做一做全才，但那是暫時已放棄其作為專家。</p>
<p>因之對於專家弄出來的戲劇，無須希望或惋惜其帶有專家氣。</p>
<p>就要做戲劇家說，懂不懂戲劇問題，到此可以得到相當結論。但同時勢也感到，作為讀者或觀衆，懂不懂的問題，另有一種作用</p>
<p>我不知道是不是有人說過，戲劇是讓觀衆選擇的東西。我們的戲劇却傳統地是選擇觀衆。</p>
<p>選民被義慕的時代，是戲劇界的盛世。</p>
<p>崑劇的選還有在，且不减低其自傲，不過已不能在一般觀衆中發生作用。</p>
<p>皮黃還有很大的潛勢力，但企望的選民雖有，而老選民每加以否决，其結果將也和崑劇一樣地亡國。</p>
<p>話劇始終沒有達到選民成為榮譽的境地，它的盛世還沒有來。</p>
<p>懂戲劇的人太少這慨歎，時常可以聽到。</p>
<p>同時有人慨歎看不到戲劇，而悶在房間裏讀劇本。</p>
<p>讀劇本燃起看戲的慾望。但偶然的機會看戲回來，都使人感到讀劇本更可滿足。</p>
<p>有些劇本根本不能上演，有一部份人說，但也有人說是劇本都可上演。</p>
<p>奧尼爾在遇到碼頭劇場一班人之前，誰也不相信他的劇本有演出的可能。</p>
<p>已有事業的舞台經理不作冒險的嘗試確有可原諒的苦衷。</p>
<p>苦衷乃轉為理由，理由又轉成例規，容易遵守的例規自然地容易被堅持。</p>
<p>一般人所能權的，自然常不能和弄戲劇的人所懂的一樣。</p>
<p>歸結，我們無從說懂戲劇。</p>

<p>作家介紹</p>
<h3>奧斯特洛夫斯基之死</h3>
<p>— 林琪</p>
<p>蘇聯的一個偉大的殘廢作家</p>
<p>“以鋼鐵是怎樣鍜鍊”一書而成名</p>
<p>年青的蘇聯殘廢作家尼珂萊•奧斯特洛夫斯基（Nikolai　Ostrovski）已於一九三六年十二月一十二日終止了他的英勇苦鬥的一生了。</p>
<p>奧斯特洛夫斯基的短促的一生，是在令人難以相信的多難中艱苦地度過來的。革命的初期，他還是一個小孩，在烏克蘭的一個車站食堂中洗碟子，忍受着主人和司役的叱罵和踢打。但是當時的運動幫助了他的機警和勇敢的才能的發展，他投身運動中。大大地協助了那時的秘密工作。十五歲的時候，他和其他一切的青年們一樣，把他的青春的熱血供獻給革命的戰爭，參加了烏克蘭的赤色騎兵隊和青年團。經歷了無數次和敵人的生死肉搏，騎在馬背上衝陷過多少敵人的陣壘，終於在一次追擊中，一個巨彈在他的面前爆炸開了，使他受了重傷。</p>
<p>在赤衛軍醫院裏，他經過適當的療養，得以暫時地恢復了康健。他立刻又投入工作的漩渦中。在工業，農場，鐵路各部門，以他的永不枯竭的精誠和熱力，他幫助了新社會的經濟的和文化的建設。不久，傷寒症又使他睡倒了。但他重新掙脫了死神的利爪，站起來，依然出色地參加了宣傳，組織，以及領導那擴大了的青年團的工作他不斷地和各種徧向鬥爭，打擊了官僚主義和空談怠惰的人們。他那年青勇敢的有力的步伐，踏碎了一切途中的障害和毒虫。他的活動，帶來了光榮與勝利。生活的殿門，正在他的面前展開來。</p>
<p>正當這個時候，潛藏已久的舊創，突然發作了，疾病開始侵蝕着他的身體。頭痛，神經系統的衰弱，傷寒症的强襲，使他失去了工作的力量，不得不有一個較長期的休養。但是休養期一滿，不管醫生對於他的病症感到棘手而勸告他不要再那樣過度地操勞，他還是立刻回到工作的團體中，在一個工業區裹領導着青年團的活動。他是不能離開了工作而生活的，在寫給他的兄弟的一封信中，他這樣寫着：“在這個世上，對於我沒有比從戰列上落伍更可怕的事情了。那簡直是不能想象的。”但災難並不因此而放鬆了他的獵物，他的有腿被汽車輾傷了，於是不得不施行手術，又來一次休養。</p>
<p>不幸接連地發生。左腿跟着也麻痺了，隨卽是手臂和腕節。這時他纔二十四歲，正是生命充滿了彩色和芳香，工作與情愛的時候；然而他必須忍受着四肢失去活動，臃臥病床的痛苦。現代的醫術，還沒有能力可以救助他脫離這一悲慘的苦境。但他並不絕望，他仍然掙扎斗爭。他要求担負一些無須體力活動的文化工作，可是遭受了拒絕，因為他過去沒有受過很好的教育，他寫得不很好。</p>
<p>隨後，更大的災難咬碎了他的身心。他永遠失去了他的一雙眼睛，沉淪在無邊無底的黑闇當中。再也看不見陽光，花朶，同志們的微笑，和活潑的青春了。他手裏提着那枝冰冷的手槍，幾次都想這樣完結了他的生命。但他究竟是一個勇敢的人生戰士，他克服了那可恥的誘惑。</p>
<p>人們再替他施行了一次複雜的手術，劃裂了他的脊柱，扭轉了他的脖頸，但一切終歸無効。用他的僅存的生機和活力，他開始從另一方面來幫助新社會的建設。他决定從事文學。他的親切的青年團的朋友，送了他一架收音機，大家經常輸流地大聲讀作品給他聽。他用心地舉習文法，研究古典的文學。在這種艱難的絛件中，他開始寫了第一部處女作。他常可以整段整頁地背誦出他所寫的東西來。如果恰巧旁邊沒有人替他立刻紀䤸下他忽然想起了的一段佳構或文句的時候、他便對那收音機說出他的構思，把牠收在留聲片上。他把他的處女作送出去給別人批評，但是郵政局把牠全部遺失了。他却並不因此心灰氣餒。</p>
<p>從一九三零年到一九三四，費去四年的工夫，他把自身的經騐寫成了那部一舉驚人的巨作，“鋼鐵是怎樣鍜鍊的”（How　the　Steelem　L）的上下兩卷。在這部書裏面，他成功地刻畫出了一個在革命中成長，被革命的現實鍜鍊成鋼鐵一般堅强的童年戰士的姿態，說這是純粹自傳式的複寫，那是不確的。雖然在藝術的成就上還有一些缺點，但那洋溢着的青春的精神，新鮮的力量，勇敢的氣魄，以及所描繪的透徹的現實性，他給我們創造了一個“大典型的環境中的典型的性格”。他之能够得到伊里奇勛章的榮譽，决非偶然的僥倖。</p>
<p>繼“鋼鐵是怎樣鍜鍊的“之後，在檢齊市（Sochi)的市委員會的援助之下，奧斯特洛夫斯基每天依然工作十至十二小時，着手於這部小說的電影劇本的編製，同時從事第三部長篇“暴風雨之子”。在他那和僵屍一樣的肉體中，蘊藏着烈熠似的熱情，鋼鐵般的信仰。然而人力究竟還不能完全徵服自然，這偉大而年青的心臟，在上一個月終於停止牠的跳動了，對着他的悲壯而短促的一生，我們怎能不以最崇高的尊敬的心情，來表示我們的哀悼與惋惜，同時自身也被激勵與感染呢？</p>

<p>皮袍大衣討論會</p>
<h3>裘話</h3>
<p>— 一塵</p>
<p>在這洋貨呢絨壓境之間，一般醉心歐化的摩登女子，為要表示其曲線美起見，不愿把皮貨來做皮大衣，這是已鐵般的事實，她們情愿在這冬天裹，穿着單夾的旗袍，窄袖細腰，外面套上一件舶來品的呢大衣，不顧膚顫肌栗，有的更連大衣也不着，把面部凍得赤紅，我想，這是活該，實際的說起來，她們並不是為了節儉問題，乃是要暴露其曲線美的問題，要知道穿了皮大衣，內溫可不洩，外寒可不侵，於自己身體上，有抵抗冬之神的勇氣，於國家經濟上說起來，也挽回莫大的漏巵，我願愛摩登的仕女們，多多穿着皮大衣，利己利國，何樂而不為？况且至聖先師孔子，他不但喜歡穿皮衣，而且穿皮衣還有美術化的設計呢！這並不是我來瞎說，論語鄉黨篇裏有這樣一段記載：“緇表羔裘，素衣麑裘，黃衣狐裘，褻裘長，短右袂。”在這寥寥數字裹，其關於皮貨該怎樣置備，怎樣設計配掛，什麽地方穿什麽皮貨，什麽皮貨該什麽尺寸，也面面顧到了呢。因為是羔裘，所以配上緇衣，麑裘配上素衣，狐裘配上黃衣，這不是孔子的美術化設計嗎？並且，因要適體取暖，常着裘衣加長，因作事要便利，把右邊的袖子，略為削短些。在現在全國一致尊孔聲中，我們對孔子這樣的提倡皮貨衣服，應當來遵行才是，摩登仕女們，你們也快快覺悟那才不失摩登仕女們的責任，對於經濟上，更是可節儉不少，雖不能仿晏子一件狐裘穿到三十年，然至少三五年裏，也許不謂其敝，再就時令來說，周禮上有：“天官司裘，掌為大裘，以供王祀天之服，中秋獻良裘，季秋獻功裘，”更何况乎現在的冬天，救寒莫若重裘呢。</p>
<p>關于裘的故事现在我來摘述幾以作結束。</p>
<p>鹔鸘裘買酒。司馬相如和文君返成都，因為愁懣不歡，想起酒可解愁，但身無分文，於是不得已將所穿的鹔鸘裘，賣給楊昌來沽酒解愁。窮中尋樂，也非自今人始呢。這在西京褋記裹，是這樣載着：“司馬相如初與卓文君還成都，居貧愁懣，以所服鹔鸘裘就市人楊昌，貫酒與文君為歡，”</p>
<p>盜獻狐白裘得救。秦囚孟嘗君，而孟嘗君即求救于秦王辛姬處，但辛姬什麽條件都不提出，衹要已獻給昭王的狐白裘，就可以放孟嘗君，這倒是難壞了孟嘗君，幸而有客能狗盜，遂去盜狐白裘來，獻給辛姬，於是孟嘗君遂得放歸了。這是在史記上記着。</p>
<p>暑不解裘。類書篡要載：“張志和常以大布製裘，嫂為躬績，及衣成之，雖暑不解。”這未免太笑話，難道眞的似北冰洋那樣總年着裘。</p>
<h3>經濟專家的一席經濟話</h3>
<p>— 胡鎧</p>
<p>冬季禦寒品惟有皮貨可擋</p>
<p>老陳方圓的面孔。畜着一個八字鬚。常常現着笑容，矮胖的身材。一眼看是個五十開外的人了。閃閃的目光。流利的口才。顯示着是位精明的商人。他開着一爿雙開間的米店。營業極是發達。雖然擁着四五萬的家產。但是他的性情是一文如命。平日不肯輕易浪費一文。他時常說“一文迫死英雄漢”。須將有時思無時。莫待無時。想有時。舉凡日常所需。無不斤斤較量。擇便宜而行。鄰人議他“雞蛋壳裏算出四兩骨。加他一個經濟專家的綽號。他亦自不諱。是的。老陳確有副本能。買物品必是價廉物美。</p>
<p>每到冬季。老陳自己。老陳的夫人。和兩個兒子。一個女兒。身上着的。都是皮貨。不由使鄰人懷疑。暗地裏說。老陳別的都節儉。着的一項。怎麽這樣的奢華。</p>
<p>這一天。隔壁布莊裏的老板陸先生。請老陳先生吃年夜飯。老陳想。布莊裏的朋友。衣着非常漂亮。我素來比不上他們。今天我却也不示弱了。要同他們較量一較量。随口叫夫人取新做的皮大衣來。夫人滿口答應。跑到摟上取出一件新做的皮大衣跑下樓交給老陳。老陳笑嬉嬉的把這件新大衣披在身上得意洋洋、欣然而往。一步跨進布莊的客室裏。已見團團圓圓的坐着三桌。祇等他光臨。老陳也不客氣的坐下。不知道怎麽的。座上的客人。目光緊緊的射注在老陳身上。酒過二巡。主人陸先生最也忍不住的開口對老陳道。陳先生。你自己可知道。今天在座的客人。爲什麽目光都朝你射。老陳很爽口的答道。我着了一件新做的皮大衣的緣故吧。滿座客哄然一笑。陸先生復對老陳道。陳先生。這個不是我打趣你。我們店中每月吃二石米。一年算一算。交易你多少生意。你除了剪－些單夾衣的布。和一些國産面子布。很少交易我們的呢羢。駝羢的裏子貨。難道你不着棉的嗎？老陳笑着回答說。陸先生。你不看見我們部着皮袍嗎？話未說完。同桌的小王插嘴說。老陳。別人說你經濟。你實在一點都不經濟。單就衣服一項說。你合家都着皮貨。每件數十金算。那末這筆耗費就大了。這難道要算經濟嗎？老陳喝了一口酒。吃了一些菜。頓了一頓頭。笑對小王道。小王。別人尊我“經濟專家”。我也承認自己是夠精明的經濟專家。難道我打的算盤。還為錯嗎？普通做件棉袍子也須化上十元八元的錢着得一二年棉花轉硬就沒有禦寒的能力。若做得漂亮點。則一元五角一尺的外國駝羢。一元五角一尺的馬達呢。做成一件袍子着在身上。也沒有效力。要是化了三十四十元的錢。買一件皮統子。配一個牢固的面子。着上暖而輕。今年着明年着。後年又着。年年的着。旁人見我着的皮袍子。總說我闊氣。年年着皮袍子。實在着皮袍子比着棉袍子驼羢袍子要便宜得多哩。像我身上的一件皮袍子是初到上海時買的現在二十多年了只换得個面子依然是件皮袍子。陸先生又打趣道。陳先生。今年是眞的不經濟了嗎？怎麽連皮大衣也穿起來。老陳道。說什麽呢？年紀一年一年的長上去。身體一年一年衰下來。單是穿件皮袍子。實在跑出去吃不消。想做一件大衣着。跑到西裝大衣店裏去。問問呢羢大衣的價格。說是外國新到的什麽呢。每件特價八十元。做工奉送。嚇得我一跳。連連跑出。走回家中。路上想。一件呢大衣。特價八十元着在身上說是禦寒。恐怕無效。說是漂亮。一來不是似我的人。二是也沒有什麽特徵。回到家裏。講起這件事。兒子說父親。你不知道今年裘業界提倡皮大衣嗎裘業界為了力求普遍起見特別以“價廉物美”為宗旨。父親既然要做大衣。不妨去看看我立起就跑。走到裘業中心區。化了五十元的代價已做了－件上等的皮大衣。正巧承陸先生寵招吃年夜飯。我要出一老風頭。把這件新的皮大衣穿着。果然暖而美。很合我的心。在大衆面前惟我獨尊的出足風頭。哈哈！老陳說了一大篇。便喝了一杯酒。又說道。憑我幾十年的經騐。冬季的衣料唯－的抵寒品祇有皮貨。最經濟。最牢固。除皮貨以外。無出其左者。</p>
<p>少頃席散。大家都佩服老陳的高見。臨海中深深印着老陳皮大衣風頭獨健。牢記着寒冬禦寒品。惟有皮货的經騐之言。</p>
<h3>關於改革皮袍的芻見</h3>
<p>— 周斯泳</p>
<p>當北風怒吼白雪亂飄的時候，本刊特闢“皮袍大衣討論會”一欄，這的確很適合實際需要的，何况穿衣問題和人們的關係非常密切。</p>
<p>在冬天，穿衣的目的，當然以禦寒為第一要義，至於禦寒力最强的衣服，不外乎皮袍和大衣兩種，這也就是本文要討論的范圍。</p>
<p>皮袍和大衣，究屬誰優誰劣？我以為皮袍較大衣為優，不信，有事實可以證明：第一，皮袍的價格比大衣便宜，一件蹩脚大衣最賤需十四，五塊錢，若配上西裝，圍巾等，非三，四十元不可；如果費十四，五塊錢買一件皮袍子，質地已經很不壞了，裏面穿的棉襖褲亦比西裝省得多，在經濟方面是很合算的。第二，皮袍的禦寒力較大衣强，皮的東西，上身即暖，愈着則愈热，穿在身上眞和火爐一般；但大衣又短，又硬，又薄，初穿時眞及不上皮袍暖，却反重得要命。第二，皮袍的重量比大衣輕，冬天的厚呢大衣，往往重得像死牛一般，若身體衰弱的人穿了，眞有些不勝其壓；至於皮袍則較大衣要輕，軟軟地不像大衣般壓得人透不過氣來，雖然質地較劣的皮袍分量也很重，但比之質劣的大衣則輕得多。</p>
<p>皮袍比大衣的優點既如上述，但未始沒有缺點，最著的有以下幾點：第一，太長，走路和乘車很不便利。第二，染了齷齪不客易洗滌。第二，下把太寬大，風容易吹入。第四，頸項間太簿，不能抵禦寒風。對症發藥，應有下列幾種改革：</p>
<p>第一，袍的長度應短一些，最好離脚背約兩寸光景，毛不可拖在外面，這樣行動起來才便當。而且也不易染着地上的汚穢。瀘江大學校長劉洪恩博士，就是竭力提倡長袍減短的一位，他穿的長袍，過膝不到三寸，效法的人很多，尤其是大學教授等。</p>
<p>第二，改良現在的製法，要使皮袍洗滌便利，應把現在的製法改良一下，最好皮和袍料不要縫在一起，可用掀鈕扣住，夾里做兩層，既挺刮又可避免掀鈕孔的難看：要洗時，可把皮取下來，同時在春秋的時候，還可以當夾袍子穿，一舉兩便，很合經濟原則。</p>
<p>第三，下把的又要開得小一些，最長不得過一尺二寸，有鈕扣的一邊，應多加兩個扣子，外面的風才不易吹進來；大衣的長處，就是下把緊小，傎得去效法的。</p>
<p>第四，領頭要兩個，一個是普通般夾的，氣候不十分冷時用，一個是皮的，應高和大一些，冷的時候可以翻上，保護頸項預防冷風的侵襲；縫製的方法，也用掀鈕扣上，可根據氣候的寒暖，决定配那一個，才不致有過冷過熱之弊。</p>
<p>皮袍子，若有了以上幾種改革，穿的時候那才覺得適意，較之笨重的大衣，眞要好上幾倍！</p>
<h3>適合國人口味的——皮袍大衣</h3>
<p>— 劍青</p>
<p>小時候聽見過一個笑話，講一個法國留學生，回來賞月，說中國的一切太不如人，就是月亮也不及巴黎地方所看見的大，這句話雖是不通，到也有一個解釋，就是在巴黎，都市的一切繁榮，就櫬出了月亮的光芒，反之在中國的鄉村裏，四面靜靜的，也就襯出了索然無味的月亮，這樣二者之間的不同，是很容易看出來的，不過我們也不能批評那個好，那個差，巴黎的月亮，有地上的霓虹，而益覺其豪華，鄉村的月亮，在自然的襯托下，而益顯其清高，二者各有各的美，也適合了各種人的胃口。</p>
<p>自從十九世紀以來，謝謝現代的發明——輪船——和我們幾千年前的遺產——指南針——把西洋的一切物質文明一占腦兒塞進了這閉關自守的中國來，他們看大砲我們得學造，他們有兵艦我們也得去買，這還罷了，在這交替的時代中，更產生一種迷信西洋的人物，譬如他們有洋文，我們應得去讀，可是不應荒廢祖國本來的文字，更應當的加研究改良、這是因為我們中國人當然有中國人的特點，有中國的特殊環境，不能削足就履以迎合一切西洋的舶來品。</p>
<p>對於服裝問題，本是衣食住行四大問題之一而是人生最切膚的，關於這－點西裝有西裝的好處，中裝有中裝的好處，譬如西裝的好處在精神的緊張，而中裝則在舒適在生理術生的方面講，避免很多結帶的束縛，使血脈能自然流通，同時對於保護體溫也速非西裝可及，西洋的歐洲人，他們的西裝也是一步，一步的改良製造而來，現在環境氣候地質一切不同的中國人，想直接的完全接受，不加一些改良，那當然是不會合用的。</p>
<p>人類是有改良更進的能力的我們覺得洋房不合中國人胃口就有中西合壁的中式其外西式其內的房子出現，為什麽對於西裝的問題尤其是大衣問題，還是墨守成規，冬季穿了呢大衣，立在凜冽的寒風中而不一思改良呢？</p>
<p>因此我們對於皮袍大衣的提倡，自當加以擁護，皮袍大衣的優點在：</p>
<p>㊀保溫　獸皮的保溫力最好，那是誰都承認的，大衣的作用當然在暖和，在冬季穿呢大衣，在中國的中部北部就覺得太不夠太不澈底，這呢大衣的缺點：就是皮袍大衣的優點。</p>
<p>㊁舒適　皮袍大衣用皮做大衣，呢大衣太硬大拘束，不　皮毛的柔輕舒敵。</p>
<p>㊂美觀　皮袍大衣顏色複雜，不似呢大衣的單純，我們不敢說較繁複的顏色一定是美觀的，然而我相信在良好的調和之下，一定是較為美觀的。</p>
<p>㊃愛國　中國的西北產皮革，服用皮袍大衣便是提倡國貨，挽回中國的經濟厄運。</p>
<p>以上的優點，有的或有不適同於西洋人的地方，那末我們可以知道皮袍大衣的最大優點仍在適合於中國人，是免去削足就履的大改革。</p>
<h3>一件値得提倡的過時服裝——皮外套</h3>
<p>— 孑予</p>
<p>滿清時代的服裝，有二種是值得提倡的：（一）以旗袍代女子的裙，（二）以皮外套代大衣。現在旗袍已成普遍的服裝了，而外套仍不免被人視同古物，迄無人提倡，未免令人發生滄海遺珠之感。</p>
<p>當民國初年，誰也不會相信，旗袍將成為女子的常服。因為那時個對於滿州的裝束，均認為帝制的餘孽，禁目不暇，還有人敢明目張膽地提倡嗎？可是事實上的簡便，終能把無謂的心理打倒。况且民國的成立，本來揭櫫漢滿蒙回藏五族共和，我們更應該互相採長補短地，使這五大民族，同化為中華民國的國族。所以這五族間的風俗，習慣，和服裝，我們只可下優劣是非的辨別，决不能生岐視輕蔑的觀念。這一點，在我提倡滿清時代的外套服制以前，所應先向諸位解釋明白的。</p>
<p>以皮袍代替大衣，對於國貨，原已盡了提倡的義務；可是究竟穿和脫，手續比較麻煩。而且兩襲長衣，緊裹一身，更有行路扦格之不便。所以在提倡者，以萬分熱心高唱着：而服用者，猶未免勉勉強強依從者。其結果，終難得普及的。假如能夠把外面的皮袍，變做外套格式，則袖口下擺放大，鈕扣代以帶轉，穿脫自較簡便不少，行路亦不致會比大衣困難。</p>
<p>况我所提倡的皮外套，並不一定要像滿清時代的翊頂補褂那個樣兒。我們仍不妨依照外套的大致，來加以局部的改變。譬如領口做成活動的翻領：兩脇下加以插手等等。而仍以平緞或花寧，作為面子，配以天青，藏青，咖啡等顏色，較諸大衣，恐怕只有美觀，决無缺憾呢！</p>
<p>倘如利用鈕扣已用帶轉一點，左右可以不分。把皮的裏子，當做衣時，也加以小小注意，使外套可以正反都好穿，那就格外便利了。</p>
<p>隨便什麽一件事，都有個習慣。我們從外套時代，改穿大衣，對於外套，就視同過時的遺老。若從新把大衣翻做外套，將來也有視大衣如寒酸的一天。不過在習慣初變的時候，好像有一些詫異吧了。根本想起來，當我們廢除外套的時候，何嘗沒有過相同的詫異。這就要請社會領袖人物，先來做個榜樣，同時更需要服裝公司，下一個特別宣傳。</p>
<h3>提倡皮裘與國貨運動</h3>
<p>— 張巴玲</p>
<p>站在國貨界的立場上說起來，提倡皮裘，和國貨運動的前途，實在是有着密切的關係的。因為提倡皮裘運動，確乎是包含了，使人不可漠視的價値。</p>
<p>我們大家都知道，皮裘是咱們中國的國產，能禦寒，質輕鬆，每逢嚴寒時節，具有購買力的人們，不論男女，誰都喜歡做件皮袍子來穿穿的。經濟能力充足的人，固然一件一件又一件的辦個不休，而且，各色各樣的皮類，也都收羅齊備，就是經濟能力比較簿弱的人們，那末，一件皮袍子，是再也不能少下去的了，我們只要看，在這嚴寒時節，穿皮袍子的人的眾多，就可以知道，這便是一闢有力的證明，是事實勝於雄辯的鐵證。</p>
<p>復次，我們更深深的覺得，穿着皮裘的衣裳，不但在身體方面，可以抵禦嚴寒的侵襲，維持體魂的健康，在另一方面看來，更具有提倡國貨的意義，因為在這個時代，有許多人，專門競向摩登，醉心歐化，喜歡在這嚴寒的氣節，穿着那舶來的西服，假如這西服的質料，絕對的採用國產呢絨，那也罷了，徧徧他們却又購置那舶來品的呢絨，以致金錢的外溢，莫可勝計。據江海關的統計，民國二十五年一月至十一月間外貨呢絨的進口數，竟達國幣二四.一六○，一四二元之多，試問：這是一个多麽骇人听闻的數目然而，购置衣服最旺的十二月份，還不統計在內，假如把全年的進口數字，總共的合併起來，這個龐大的數目，更將如何的使人咋舌不下呢！</p>
<p>所以，就作者的憑見看來，我們對于皮裘運動，姑無論站在禦寒方面講，或是站在提倡國貨的立場上講，都覺得有提倡的必要，和提倡的價值。假如有人認為提倡皮裘，是落伍的，是開倒車的，那末，試問讓同胞們的經濟力量，一古腦兒的被外國人吸收凈盡，倒是一件合理的事嗎？</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>陝甘局勢可望全部解决</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>當陝甘局勢還在最緊張的時候，余早料陝甘事變，决不會無法解决，一定有和平解决的希望，果然，昨日报上，居然有陜甘局勢，可望全部解决，王樹常孫蔚如不日可就職的消息披露，此種消息，雖尚未到公開證實的時期，但料公開證實的時期，必不在遠，或者此文貢獻給諸位閱者之前，此種消息，業已證實，也未可知。</p>
<p>我的預料，並非像滬上算命先生拆字先生一樣，全憑五行生尅與觸機論字，我的預料是：自蔣委員長在西安安全回京後，陝局方面，再不會有事變發生，即使有問題發生，亦不致若何嚴重，其情勢至為明顯，不料蔣委員長回京後，竟有楊于抗命的事件發生，此實令人莫名其土地堂者也。</p>
<p>我細細考量楊于抗命的原因，必有其相當的因素，此種因素，我輩雖未得知，但看中央寬大為懷的本旨，非但對於于楊，不欲作嚴屬之懲處，而且肯格外優容，倘于楊能改過自新，痛自悔悟，决不加以嚴重的根究，而于楊身為軍人，應知軍人的天職，當此外禍日深，匪偽搗亂之際，還敢作此破壞統一，違抗中央的舉動，非但全國輿論，實所痛心，卽自問良心，當在何許。</p>
<p>我看準以上兩點，所以我敢斷言，陝甘局勢，必能和平解决，卽使倘有問題，發生齷齪，當數度談判之後，自可迎刃而解，决不至再到破裂地步，試觀現在國際間的形勢，若何嚴重，其間任何主張，均應犧牲，一致對外，拼命抗敵，若于楊再不痛自覺悟，則禍國之罪，誠有不能辭其咎矣。</p>
<h3>“大雷雨”觀後感</h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>業餘劇人在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>“總而言之，我認為世界之劇從舞台上來介紹，是件必要的工作！不過，我們所應特別注意的是：就儘可能地使它有較大的社會效果在我們的社會中。”（章泯：關於世界名劇的介紹）</p>
<p>章泯先生所導演的“大雷雨”，在我們的社會中，它有怎樣的“社會效果”呢！</p>
<p>以奧斯特洛夫斯基時代的“大雷雨，和現在我們的社會來比較，那實在太近似了，像卡彭諾瓦那樣的婆婆，像卡德林那樣的小媳婦，在我們這個社會裏，祇要你留心一下，你說，能發現多少？</p>
<p>奧斯特洛夫斯基是非常忠實於他的時代的，他使那個受盡了磨折的可憐的卡德林投了河，因為他知道在這樣環境中的小媳婦，她的解脫便衹有所謂“永遠的安息”這一條路，使她投河的理由，那不僅是她最後的主持者，她的情人鮑里司怯弱地離開了她，而在卡德林還在做姑娘的時候，她的生活就是和朝山進香的老婆婆們生活在一起，在晚禱的時候，會莫名其妙的一面哭一面祈禱着，自己也不知道在祈禱着什麼，哭些什麼，在這樣環境中生長的女兒，她的出路就祇有用死來解脫地的苦惱了。在我們的社會中，在我們的農村中，小媳婦受不了婆婆或丈夫的打罵，悄悄地投河自盡的，不是多着嗎？在她們做姑娘的時候，不是也是跟着共老婆婆們“朝山進香”的打發着日子嗎？</p>
<p>但是，奧斯特洛夫斯基在這陰慘慘的故事中，他也給我們預期了受虐待的婦女的另一條路，他使瓦爾瓦拉離開了家庭跟着情人走了。</p>
<p>業餘劇人的這次上演“大雷雨”，據說是非常忠實於原著的。這劇本我沒讀過，究竟是否有出入因之也無從知道，但以這次演出所看到的，則據淺妄的我看來，覺得這劇本似乎還可以加以删改，例如第三幕，我以為就叫省去，其他幾幕中，有些對白也可以刪除，這樣，這個悲劇的印象，一定會比現在更深。雖然這於忠於原作說來，是打了折扣了。</p>
<p>關於忠於原著問題，據我看來，也是應該以社會效果為大前提的，為了使我們的社會有更大的社會效果，即使和原作有了些出入，也不妨犧牲些原作，由於這點，把世界名劇改編為中國風味，就也成了件必要的工作！</p>
<p>倒如像“大雷雨”，如果業餘劇人肯更多化些精神，我相信，他的社會效果是也一定决不止此的。</p>
<p>導演者在導演這個戲的時候是很費了番力氣的，這從演員的位置以及他們的動作上可以看得出來，每幕戲所收的效果，也正如預期的那樣，我們如果把這個整個的戲一段段分開來看，那眞是再好沒有了，但是，如果把這個六幕劇整個的來看一下呢，則總覺得缺少些什麼似的，這或許是魄力不够，但用“魄力不够”這四個字來說叫，好像又覺得不大確當，仔細的分析一下呢，則大概是由於㊀劇本的限制，劇本的分幕對主線是太鬆了；㊁總演者大概由於太注重於每幕中的戲，而忽略了每幕戲間的聯繫。</p>
<p>舞台裝置眞漂亮透了，我相信在中國的劇壇上，就從來沒有這樣漂亮而眞實的舞台面過，尢其是第一景和第四景，這樣美麗的舞臺面，那簡直是一幅充滿詩情的畫，一幅立體的畫。</p>
<p>效果在第一幕中是比較差些，（我看的是第一天日場）但在第五幕中便顯得很好，由於經驗和熟練，在以後的幾場中，－定能更臻於美善吧。</p>
<p>演員們的演技大都都在水準以上，這裏，更使我歡喜的是藍蘋，舒繡文，趙丹，葉露茜諸位，他們很正確地把握了每個腳色的個性，而又把它充分地發揮了出來，其他如鄭君里，顧而已，章曼蘋，呂玑諸君也很努力，也很盡職。</p>
<p>這是一個值得一看的戲，我敢向諸位推荐。</p>
<h3>村中</h3>
<p>— 張海</p>
<p>清晨，寒冷逼人，外面底昨天融化的雪水，都凍結成透明的薄冰，地上像裝罩了一層玻璃。房簷底下靜臥着的駱駝，閉着眼－動也不動，似乎牠在聽遠處獵人的角笛聲。風停了，寒冷却加倍的逼人。</p>
<p>“薩勒！薩勒！”同行者布里雅特蒙古人，喊着在熟睡的駝夫。</p>
<p>駝夫薩勒揉着沒有睡足的睛眼，遲緩的爬起床來。抽着菸趕着駱駝往草地上放牧去了。</p>
<p>今天輪到了皓明和素珊夫婦倆做飯，布里雅特蒙古人巴魯丹，替做飯的伙伴打了水來，他和藹的向他們說：</p>
<p>“你們要快些做呀！我們要到村中逛一逛，兩個鐘頭就回來吃飯！啊！別忘記把昨天買的那兩隻兔子也要弄了吃！”</p>
<p>太陽出來囉美国女人傑蒲背着他的照相機，從小就同我在海參威同學的伏侖斯基喝着西伯利亞大平原的民歌，巴魯丹總喜歡把一隻手搭在別人肩上走路。現在他走在最前邊，我們四個像醉漢似的，唱着哼着踏進了村子。</p>
<p>“臭煞人！簡直是進了大糞廠！傑蒲一邊說一邊用手帕堵鼻子。</p>
<p>滿街滿處都有糞堆，發着奇臭，可是我們並不因此而立刻離開這裏。狗瘋狂的呌，追着我們，巴魯丹用蒙古話請求着村人，讓狗別來咬我們。果然門口站着的中年婦女，或是老年人，很快的就把狗喚進家裏。我們安然無事的遊逛着。</p>
<p>這是個破落的村莊，人家不多，而且到處都呈着窮苦的景象。村人用奇異的眼色望着我們，有的人却藏在門裏，把眼順著門縫看我們這幾個人。或許是他們怕外國人，所以連看都不敢明目張膽的看。</p>
<p>一家門口有三個婦女坐在陽光底下做活兒，我們的出現自然使她們驚詫，因為巴魯丹先給她們打話，意思是呌她們別害怕·其中有個十七八歲的姑娘，長得挺健美，裸露着半腿，用手在赤腿上不停的搓蔴繩，已然带着半開化人的風味了。伏侖斯基依在我耳邊說：</p>
<p>“你瞧！比麗拉還美呢麗拉是我我海參威時愛着的一個蘇聯女子。</p>
<p>將近村子的盡頭，有棵古老的棗樹，我們三人靠在棗樹的巨幹上，傑蒲給我們拍照。接着我們就坐在樹根上休息。街巷的轉灣處出現了一個老人，着白的長鬚，穿着一身紫色的長袍子。他慢慢地走近來，和藹的同巴鲁丹講話：</p>
<p>“你們是打哪裏來的？”</p>
<p>“庫倫！我們都是從庫論來的！”</p>
<p>在他那滿是皺痕的老臉上露出微笑，但很快的他又沉下了臉，彷彿心頭忽然記起什麼事情？終於他又說話了：</p>
<p>“往南去嗎？大概你們沒聽到什麼風聲吧？伊克昭盟（綏遠）有戰事中國兵和矮鬼子打！前面的路怕不好走？他們常常把過路人當奸細逮去治罪！××人還時常到我們這裏來招兵，青年小伙子給他們騙去的不少，聽說都打死了！現在再可沒人上當囉先生幫××打中國人太沒良心啦！”</p>
<p>“是的！老伯伯我們也是準備去打仗的，可是我們是去反抗××的侵略啊！”我興奮的對那老人講。</p>
<p>回來，飯已煮熟就在陽光下站着吃飽。</p>
<p>離開葛爾村時，光前的那個老人把他的兒子，一個年輕力壯的小伙子送來：</p>
<p>“諸位！帶着我這孩子去吧，他會放槍，打得很準哪！”</p>
<p>前進，我們又添了一個伙伴！</p>
<h3>雪飄着</h3>
<p>— 林吉</p>
<p>他這一天起得特別早，睁開眼睛，就看見掛在壁上的那半舊的時鐘才七點零五分；他相信這是準確的時刻。妻已經先起了床，在樓下給他燒稀飯去了：她眞是一個好主婦，就是有娘姨，她還是要親自動手，花廚房裏忙着做事。對於這樣的妻，他想應該給她－點什麼酬報！比如買一件衣料給她吧，今天不正是月底，發薪水的日子嗎？他這麼想着，她瞟了棒上的日歷一眼，不錯：－點也不含糊，今天是發薪水的日子。於是，他微笑了，坐在床沿打下了這樣的主意：拿到薪水並不馬上回家。他要上百貨公司，綢緞莊那些地方去，揀一件美麗的旗袍料，和一些兒童玩具，帶回家來。他要不露一點聲息，使妻看見了起先是驚異，然後是愉快，最後便撅起嘴唇埋怨他不該悄悄地去花錢，家里正當的用途還多着呢。三歲的孩子會拿到那些新奇的玩具而呌着“好爸爸”，他要拖起她來吻着，再吻她那嬌嫩的小嘴巴。妻如果願意出去，晚上他還可以領她去看看電影，好好地享受－下，妻底生活實在太枯燥了……</p>
<p>這樣想了一陣，沒有覺到妻已經拖開房門，端上洗臉水來了。她發現丈夫那麼早就起了身，似乎很替他可惜，好好的覺不睡似地，說道：</p>
<p>“怎麼起來了呀！”</p>
<p>天是陰沉的，滿天佈滿了沉重的，灰色的雲朵。八點多了，太陽還沒有出來。在公共汽車上，人們在講到今天底天气時，總是意料着要下雨。但是，他感到橫面吹來的風，不知道怎麼好像特別冷，也許會下雪哩！他麼想。</p>
<p>無論外邊怎樣冷，在三層樓上的寫字間里，却暖得你完全忘記了現在正是冬天。打字樓底聲音，女職員聽電話的聲音，網筆尖在白紙上沙沙響着的聲音……他又不時地望着時鐘，這一天在他好像過了－個月那麼地長……在吃中飯的時候，同事們正為了今天是發薪的日子而商量着夜間底消遣；那些年青的獨身漢談得挺起勁，並且有一個忽然問他</p>
<h3>鄰人的咳聲</h3>
<p>— 立自</p>
<p>在我的貼鄰，住着一個姓黃的老人。</p>
<p>我每天做完了工作，回到家裏，疲倦的躺在床上的時候，常常聽見隔壁那位老人，發着嗆咳的聲音。因為祇有一牆之隔，所以咳聲清晰的傳入我的耳鼓，使我感覺到很不奈煩！</p>
<p>天氣一冷，那位老人的咳嗽更增加了，有時候我在深夜，被他的咳聲驚醒，我便不能入睡，我想這老者必定是常患傷風或肺病，我聽見他的咳聲實在難受！</p>
<p>但是最近以來，我却聽不見那鄰人的咳聲了，我得到寗靜，非常喜慰。有一天，我遇見那老人，我便問他停止咳嗽的原因，他說：“我現在含服五洲藥房的呼吸香膠，”每天數片，所以咳嗽就痊愈了。</p>
<h3>有目共賞</h3>
<p>— 萬衆</p>
<p>人們寶貴的眼睛，可以觀賞偉大的山川，美麗的花草，錦繡的文章，……它是人們生理上最要緊的物件。所以眼睛光明的人，他必定是前途無量。</p>
<p>但是人的眼睛如有病痛，他便不能觀賞一切，而百事俱廢！這是何等不幸！</p>
<p>現在正致力藥劑運動的五洲藥房。特製“明明眼藥水”一種，係從國產黃蓮和麻黃中提出的要素，佐以鋅鹽硼酸等劑配製而成，凡是眼球發赤，眼臉紅腫，畏光流淚，瘙癢刺痛，……等等的病症，滴入立見功效，並且瓶式新穎，滴用極便，這眞可說是有目共賞的妙劑了。</p>

<p>道：</p>
<p>“你呢，要不要也一道去玩玩？”</p>
<p>他知道那個人約他完全是岀於一片好意。不過他所眷戀的只是家里的妻和孩子，他便很客氣地謝辭了，理由是他已經另外有了約會。</p>
<p>五點欠五分，薪水是送到了他底面前，他一面穿大衣，一面準備岀去了。但是另外還附有一封信，他没拆開來看看……他看着，手開始抖悸起來，是寫字間裏的熱氣突然停止了麽？他感到寒冷，身子也顫抖……同事們不知道什麽時候全走完了，茶房屈着背走了來，用奇怪的眼光瞟了他，問道：</p>
<p>“怎麽，×先生還不回家—外邊下着大雪。”</p>
<p>是的：外邊下着雪，棉花似地飄了下來：飄在摩天樓上，飄在百貨公司底大减價的旗杆上，飄在人們底帽子上……公共汽車駛到車站停了一忽，又開走了，他不曾跳上去。一味向前走着，雪花打濕了他底大衣和帽子，他都没有覺得。他重複唸了一遍那封信，他唸着，心裏像有螞蟻咬着一般地難過。他在那寫字間，不斷地工作了三年了，現在…他不明白這世界，為什麽他那樣一個人都容不了！而他還有妻子，四歳的孩子，他不能想下去了。…他行過不知道多少間綢緞莊和百貨公司了，但是没有踏進去：他已經完全陷入了另外一種境地中。</p>
<p>在那小小的房間里，那賢慧的妻子一定焦急地等着他底歸來吧，因為天已近黑，晚飯也燒好了。而他却一個幽靈那麽地亍彳於街頭。在雪花飛飄，寒冷的街頭，直走到深夜的時候。</p>
<p>雪飄着，没有休止地飄着……</p>

<p>以前以主演「孤星淚」「閨怨」「叛艦喋血記」等偉大巨片著名之大明星却爾斯勞頓，今在「聖畫情痴」中，籍其一貫的高深的藝術修養，扮演世界大畫家倫勃郎。其一舉一動，無一處不深深的刻劃出一個不修邊幅，不慕榮名的藝術家的姿態，並且氣概高超，威富不能屈，富貴不能淫，純以其天才的技巧，將宇宙間最偉大的靈感，在幾筆丹青之中表現出來。該片今日起在南京大戲院公映。導演係「英宫艷史」中大導演亞力山大戈達氏云。</p>

<p>「將軍之女」中黎灼灼與李淸在一大森林中演一段戀愛節目，在參天的古木下談情説愛，自然是很美麗的。然而那森林下盡是叢葬的古塚，變成了在墳墓裏談愛情，未免太滑稽了。但是導演的鏡頭用得其法，一點也看不出是墳墓，祇覺得它是美妙。</p>

<h3>Zhang Yang's Troops Expected to Withdraw</h3>
<p>The Shaanxi Situation Approaches Peaceful Resolution. The Longhai Railway Plans to Restore Tongguan-Xi'an Traffic. The Central Government's Policy of Suppressing Bandits Remains Unchanged.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the aftermath of the Shaanxi-Gansu incident, Gu Zhutong, the Director of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, acting on the Central Government's directives, communicated with Mi Chunlin, Xie Ke, Chuan Yuanhou, and Yang Hucheng's troops. It is reported that they have expressed their willingness to garrison at locations designated by the Central Government. All parties are currently watching this situation closely to see if Yang and others are genuinely awakening. The outcome should be clear within days. It is also reported that Mi Chunlin, Xie Ke, and others repeatedly met with Director Gu Zhutong in Tongguan, indicating that Yang Hucheng and others have become aware of the situation. Gu has set a deadline for them to demonstrate this awareness through concrete actions. All specific post-incident matters will still be handled according to the Central Government's arrangements. Measures for the aftermath of the Shaanxi-Gansu incident will be implemented gradually. Furthermore, it is reported that the Central Government is adopting a lenient approach to the Shaanxi-Gansu issue, and the situation is gradually improving. The Central Government will send personnel to investigate and handle all post-incident matters. The Military Affairs Commission will also send personnel to investigate and provide generous compensation to the deceased officers and soldiers. Additionally, Mi Chunlin and Xie Ke met with Gu Zhutong in Tongguan to discuss the general framework for a peaceful resolution of the Shaanxi situation. However, specific post-incident measures are still awaiting a decision from the Third Plenary Session. Therefore, in these two weeks, efforts will first be made to halt military advances in Shaanxi to avoid misunderstandings. Sun Weirou, the Chairman of Shaanxi, is also expected to assume his new position within the week. Wang Shuchang, the Pacification Director of Gansu, is currently staying in Beijing. According to reports, the date of his departure for Gansu has not yet been determined. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Railway sources report that the peaceful resolution of the Shaanxi situation is nearing completion. Qian Zongze traveled from Zhengzhou to Tongguan to meet with Gu Zhutong, preparing to restore traffic on the Tongguan-Xi'an line. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] He Zhuguo stated in Tongguan that he is confident in controlling Zhang's troops. All of his forces began withdrawing from the forward defense on both flanks at noon on the 28th. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Tongguan reports that with the peaceful resolution of the Shaanxi situation, Yang Hucheng, under the Central Government's generous and sincere influence, is obeying orders. The railway is planning to restore traffic. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] The 106th Division, under Shen Ke, strongly supports the Central Government and is expected to take concrete action within days. Serious conflicts have recently occurred in Gushi, north of the Wei River, with clear artillery fire heard. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chen Duan, the Director of the Gansu Provincial Finance Department, flew from Lanzhou to Beijing at 5:50 PM on the 28th to report to the Central Government. After arriving in Beijing, Chen met with Vice President Kong to report on everything. Chen stated that Yu Xuezhong has returned to the province from Shaanxi and that the current situation in Gansu is still good. When asked if he was in Beijing on Yu's orders, Chen only said that he was in Beijing for personal matters. Chen also stated at the airport that the situation in the Northwest is still complex. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Mi Chunlin, Xie Ke, He Zhuguo, and others have been consulting with Director Gu Zhutong in Tongguan for several days. As a result, Zhang and Yang's troops are expected to comply with the Central Government's orders and move to designated locations. However, their sincerity remains to be seen through their concrete actions. The Central Army is currently maintaining a strict observation posture. If the main forces of Zhang and Yang's troops can indeed continue to withdraw as ordered, the Shaanxi-Gansu situation can be peacefully resolved. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Tongguan. The Central Government is striving for leniency in handling the Shaanxi situation. Xi'an seems to have shown remorse, and the overall situation may be expected to improve. Currently, Mi Chunlin, Xie Ke, and others have been consulting with Director Gu Zhutong for several days. The Central Government's fundamental policy of suppressing bandits remains unchanged. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong's Family Flees to Ping by Air from Lanzhou</h3>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Yu Xuezhong's family, consisting of twenty-two people, flew to Ping by Eurasia charter plane via Zhengzhou on the 28th. According to those who saw them off, Lanzhou is as peaceful as usual, and all Central Government personnel stationed in Lanzhou are safe. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Results of the Jiabu Temple Meeting: One Party Orders the Re-Garrisoning of Various Bandits</h3>
<p>Bandit-Puppets Are Busy Moving Around. Wang Ying's Troops Plan to Expand to 20,000.</p>
<p>Gui Sui. The rumor that the Jiabu Temple conference would result in a major invasion by the bandits-puppets on the 28th has been clarified. It turns out that one party is extremely suspicious of Li Shouxin and other bandits and is implementing a re-garrisoning plan. Therefore, a small number of troops are moving westward along Shangdu and Zhangbei to provide cover. Since the 28th, various bandit units have begun moving to their designated defense areas. Li Shouxin's troops are moving from Shangdu to the Zhangbei and Shangyi areas. De Wang's troops are moving to the Duolun and Huade areas. Wang Ying's troops currently consist of only 2,000 men but plan to expand to 20,000 and remain stationed in the Shangdu and Batai areas. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] One party has decided to make Jiabu Temple, due to its strategic importance, a military transportation base for westward advancement. They are continuously transporting large quantities of military supplies and flour from Rehe for storage. They have ordered various counties to collect wheat flour, buckwheat flour, sorghum, etc., based on the amount of land they possess. A material collection committee has been established in the temple. The bandit-puppet army's cavalry accounts for two-thirds of their forces and urgently needs fodder. However, the land is mostly barren, and production is very low. The public is extremely fearful and uneasy upon hearing the order. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Gui Sui. However,综合各个方报告,匪伪行踪仍以退为进,故事掩饰,虚张声势,其暂取缓进模样,似颇明显. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Zhang Yuan reports that over 300 officers and soldiers of the 1st Regiment of the Pseudo-Independent Brigade arrived in Zhangbei via Duolun from western Rehe on the 27th. Over 2,000 cavalry bandits from Wang Ying's troops were transferred to Ken Village, preparing to invade eastern Suiyuan. Wang Ying recently established an office in Jiabu Temple, assigning personnel to be stationed there to handle liaison matters with one party. One party has sent personnel to various counties in northern Chahar to collect donations. Farmers are extremely resentful. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The second group of members of the Shanghai Women and Children's Frontline慰问团 arrived in Ping this afternoon. Chen Boer and others are rehearsing a new play in Ping. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Yun Wang's Representative Arrives in Sui and Will Transfer to Nanjing Immediately</h3>
<p>[Guihua] Yun Wang is extremely grateful that the National Army has recovered Bailing Temple and that the Central Government is providing disaster relief. He has specially sent Sha Beizi as a representative to Sui, who will immediately transfer to Beiping and Nanjing to visit Yan Xishan and the central authorities to express his gratitude. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Developing North China's Economy: Li Sihao Responds to Summons and Arrives in Tianjin to Report on Negotiation Progress</h3>
<p>Li Plans to Visit Tashiro for Concrete Discussions. Sakatani and His Entourage Also Leave Beiping and Return to Tianjin.</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Li Sihao arrived in Tianjin at 6 PM on the 28th in response to Song Zheyuan's summons to report on the progress of his discussions with Sakatani regarding economic issues. He plans to visit Ikeda in Tianjin for concrete discussions on economic development. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After arriving in Tianjin, Li Sihao immediately went to the British Concession Qiangzi River Road to meet with Song Zheyuan for a long discussion. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Sakatani, the General Manager of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), came to Beiping after attending the Tianjin SMR Economic Conference in Tianjin. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The lowest estimated value for the restoration of the Longyan Iron Mine is set at 14 million. The equipment at the Tangshan Steel Plant is complete and usable after repairs. An additional reverberatory furnace is to be added. The old price is set at 5 million after liquidation. Original shareholders are welcome to join the new venture. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3>Rampant Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>Foreign Merchants in Tianjin Collude with Ronin. The Number of Protected Smuggled Goods Increases Daily. British Consulate Inquires About Anti-Smuggling Affairs. Ge Dingyuan Visited Kong Yesterday to Report.</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Smuggling has been rampant in North China recently, even worse than during the spring. Merchants in Beiping and Tianjin are cooperating with smugglers. Dalian Port has a free trade zone, and European and American goods are shipped to the area without taxes. Smugglers then, under protection, transport those goods to China via the two ports in eastern Hebei, Dahe and Qinhuangdao. These goods are then linked by trains and trucks to smuggle into Tianjin. Therefore, the types of smuggled goods are now extensive. They are not limited to Japanese sugar and rayon. Valuable Western items are smuggled to evade taxes. The smuggler's organization is extensive with the backing of a military unit. The customs and road transport have reached the point of being helpless. Legitimate foreign merchants are greatly worried. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

The Tianjin-Tanggu route will coordinate with steamboats with unfixed frequency. Another automobile transportation will run between Xugezhuang and Guye in eastern Hebei, so the smuggled goods coming in through Beidaihe do not need to use the railways. The capital of 500,000 has already been raised, and many Beiping merchants are investing. The smuggled goods currently in the eastern districts are worth 50 million. The Customs estimates that, based on the current situation, it is enough to sell in North China for over six months. The Customs cracked down on the Yihecheng grocery store in Beiyingmen on the 27th and confiscated 160 bags of smuggled sugar purchased from the Tianhua Trading Company of Taiwanese in the Japanese Concession. The Customs then confiscated them. Xitian visited the Customs on the 28th to protest and demanded their return. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3>Representatives of Liberal Professions Request Reduction of Income Tax</h3>
<p>Appeals to Political, Legislative, and Other Agencies</p>

Weng instructed them to file with the Ministry of Finance for processing. They then went to the Legislative Yuan to meet with Secretary-General Liang. Finally, they petitioned the Ministry of Finance, where they were received by Gao Bingfang, the Director of the Income Tax Office. The representatives stated that the tax rates set for the first, second, and third categories, and stated that the income tax rate for the second category of salary compensation is the highest. Compared with the first and third categories, the second category is purely labor income, the income is the most difficult to obtain, and the tax is the heaviest, which is unfair. They requested for a revision. Secondly, the freedom of professional profit and loss varies greatly. If it is settled once every six months, it is still difficult to conform to the principle of paying taxes on a monthly average. It is proposed to calculate and pay on a 12-month average. The representative of the accountant also gave very detailed opinions on the collection aspects of the first category. Gao promised to report to the minister immediately for instructions. In general, the idea of calculating on a 12-month average can be adopted. Changing the tax rate requires legal procedures, which is considered difficult and temporarily unchangeable. Gao Bingfang and Liang Jingchong hosted all the representatives at the Queen's Hotel at noon to exchange views. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3>Madrid Under Fire (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>We turned a corner; there was another deafening explosion, and the eaves, bricks, and wood, mixed with glass, collapsed from a massive apartment building onto our road, about three hundred feet above our heads. We slammed on the brakes and ran into the doorway. A bomb hissed as it landed on the ground. It chilled me to the bone. "Where will it hit?" I forced the door open, trying to find a safer place to hide, but a gust of wind slammed the door back, so I retreated. The bomb exploded from the house we were hiding in to the third house. At the same time, another bomb fell. From the light popping sound, I guessed it had landed on the stone street. Half a chunk of blackened granite bounced over the roof and landed in the narrow courtyard that connected to the doorway where I was standing. A woman opened the door and called us in. "Such savages!" she cried.</p>
<p>There were no bombs for a few minutes. We opened the door. There was no sound of planes turning. We went back to the street. A man armed with a motorcycle asked for my car to transport the wounded. He was requisitioning all the cars for ambulance use. Soon, they were carrying back people with missing limbs or half their faces blown off. At that moment, everyone hated with a permanent hatred.</p>
<p>From the courtyards of many destroyed houses, women, old people, and young children began to crawl out. Everything was white; white hair, white faces, white clothes—all covered in fragmented plaster dust. A thirteen-year-old girl comforted a canary in a cage. She carried a bottle of milk under her arm. A woman held a baby, both looking very miserable, the mother in black clothes, leading the child on top of the black cloth. A wrinkled old woman, wrapped in a blanket, every wrinkle on her face trembling involuntarily, stood blankly on the road, repeatedly asking, "Where do I go?"</p>
<p>I walked back. A stream of homeless people drifted through the streets, some carrying a coat, some carrying a bundle of clothes, some carrying a child's bedding. Women stood in groups, wringing their hands tightly, shifting their waists in disappointment. This situation has been going on for weeks. I ran from street to street, and not a single window was intact. Everything looked like a city after an earthquake. Yet the people continued to live there. "Where can they go?" The Spanish government's resources have been drained by the war. There are no transport trucks or cars, no sufficient food and money to move the citizens of Madrid away, and no outside help is coming. Where is the world that responded to Belgium's appeal? Where are the millions of charitable hearts who run to church every day to pray to God? Where are the millions of charitable hearts who call themselves idealists and are busy with their own affairs, fixing their hair, and going to the theater? A city's culture and beauty are about to be buried in the dust!</p>
<p>I later learned that the air raid was carried out by twenty-eight Junkers aircraft and two Capronis aircraft. Those brave pilots knew they were killing innocent women, children, and non-combatants. They have been doing this for weeks: they have been getting good practice. They are being ordered by Berlin and Rome. Their dictatorial masters worship terror. When Abyssinia was not conquered, poison gas was immediately released. The nation that produced Cervantes, Velasquez, Goya, and El Greco is suffering the same cruel treatment as the black warriors of Selassie. Western Europe will not have a better fate.</p>
<p>In Spain, the two great powers of the world are fighting. The fascists were the first to ship in planes and arms. Now they are also the first to send in troops. Their submarines and other warships are spying on the Spanish government's fleet in the eastern ports. Their shamelessness is unparalleled, because Britain and France have shown them in many places—Abyssinia, the Rhineland—that the bold can ultimately triumph. Democratic diplomacy is no match for arrogant fascism. If Franco wins, Europe will immediately turn black, or, once Hitler and Mussolini complete their preparations for war, Europe will plunge into war. Madrid may or may not fall. That is not the end. In Navarre, in Asturias, in Aragon, government troops have won important military victories. Government troops are also advancing towards the enemy's center, Talavera. Farmer strikes and worker resistance are shaking Franco's rear. According to captured prisoners, he is hiring untrained Moors because the reserves are exhausted and the Spanish do not want to fight for him.</p>
<p>The matter has not yet been decided. This matter may drag on longer than anyone imagines now. (The End)</p>
<h3>Central Political Council Approves Additional Budget for the 24th Year</h3>
<p>National Government Orders the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to Handle in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Political Council recently approved the fifth additional budget for national ordinary revenue and expenditure for the 24th year, each amounting to 96,690,000 yuan, 1,779 yuan, 9 jiao, and 9 fen. It also resolved to extend the deadlines stipulated in Articles Four and Five of the National Treasury Revenue and Expenditure Closing Measures for the 24th year by one month each. It is learned that, in addition to ordering the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to handle the additional budget portion in accordance with regulations, the National Government has also issued a circular to all directly subordinate agencies instructing them to comply with the regulations regarding the extension of the deadlines.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Difficult Birth of the New Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>After the Hirota cabinet of Japan resigned due to the fierce attack from the parliament, the imperial household immediately appointed General Ugaki to organize a new cabinet. However, since Ugaki accepted the mandate to form a cabinet on the 24th, four days have passed, and the cabinet formation work not only has no progress but also seems to be aborting. The main reason for the difficult birth of the new cabinet is naturally the strong opposition from the military.</p>
<p>The reason for the military's opposition to Ugaki's cabinet is, on the surface, that several generals with qualifications to be Minister of the Army have refused to accept the position of Minister of the Army. But in fact, it is because they are dissatisfied with Ugaki's attitude, so they are unwilling to recommend a successor to the Minister of the Army, thus preventing the Ugaki cabinet from being formed. The reason they put forward that no one is succeeding is only a means of shirking responsibility. The military's dissatisfaction with Ugaki is because he holds relatively liberal ideas and has considerable relations with political parties. At the same time, he is responsible for the reduction of the Japanese army from 21 divisions to 17 divisions. Ugaki, with such a history, will naturally be opposed by the military, which firmly advocates actively developing outward and taking enriching national defense as the first priority. In the past few days, although Ugaki has used various methods to seek the military's understanding, the military's firm attitude has not changed in the slightest. Therefore, the difficulties Ugaki has encountered seem extremely difficult to overcome. The road ahead for Ugaki is either to retreat in the face of difficulty and resign, or to adopt extraordinary methods. The so-called extraordinary method is, on the one hand, for Ugaki to make private contacts with those qualified to be Minister of the Army and persuade them to accept the position of Minister of the Army. After obtaining their consent, the military will recommend them. On the other hand, he will petition the Emperor and use the power of the imperial household to order those qualified to assume the position of Minister of the Army. However, according to Ugaki's statement on the 27th, he does not intend to take this extraordinary method. Perhaps this 67-year-old general has another magic weapon to break through this difficulty. What the facts are, we can only look at the development of the situation in the next few days.</p>
<p>We will not discuss now whether the Ugaki new cabinet can be formed, but only briefly describe the future political trends in Japan. It is very obvious that after this cabinet crisis is resolved, the military's power in politics will greatly increase. In the early days, the military did not have much influence in politics. However, since the May 15 Incident, the phenomenon of military interference in politics has become increasingly common. Recently, the military's power has become even stronger. The Hirota cabinet was completely under the influence of the military. Even the new cabinet formed after this will necessarily be controlled by the military. Because a cabinet not approved by the military, or a cabinet not controlled by the military, will be opposed by the military at the beginning of its formation, and the military will not recommend a successor to the Minister of the Army, so that the cabinet cannot be produced. If this method continues to be used arbitrarily, it will inevitably make the cabinet a tool of the military, that is to say, all political power will be dominated by the military. In this way, there is probably no doubt that a fascist political system will appear in the Far East.</p>
<p>The rightward shift of Japanese politics is, of course, a great obstacle to the revival of our nation. Therefore, we very much hope that the result of this Japanese political crisis can maintain the usual path of constitutionalism. If not, then we can only further intensify the large-scale, sincere unity work to cope with the great evolution of the future Far East situation and strive for national independence and freedom.</p>
<h3>U.S. Flooding Becomes More Serious and Extends to the Mississippi Basin</h3>
<p>Authorities Requisition 35,000 Trucks to Transport 500,000 Downstream Residents Out of the Area</p>
<p>[Washington] The Mississippi River basin is now at risk of a major flood similar to those in Ohio and Kentucky. Authorities today requisitioned 35,000 trucks to transport 500,000 residents of the basin out of the area. President Roosevelt is determined to prevent the panic caused by floods in those states from happening elsewhere. He has ordered senior army officers to draft an unprecedented plan to transport all residents within 100,000 square miles to other locations. This includes several of the world's richest cotton-producing areas. The flooded areas on both sides of the Mississippi River are each 50 miles wide, from Cairo, Illinois, to New Orleans, Louisiana. The river's raging waters are now flowing into its largest tributary, the Ohio River, which will likely flood even more severely. The flooded area in the Mississippi River basin has reached 2 million acres. Engineers expect that the river's waters will reach their peak within a week, at which point the floodgates will be ineffective, but they still hope that it will not be necessary to relocate all residents. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[New York] The floods in the mid-eastern states of the United States are becoming increasingly serious and threaten to become a major disaster. The total material damage has reached 500 million U.S. dollars, and there are one million homeless people. The number of deaths is 261. In addition, there are more than 250 deaths in the hospitals of Louisville, Kentucky. Fearing the outbreak of epidemics, the authorities buried them without identifying them. The Mississippi River area, from Cairo, Illinois in the north to New Orleans, Louisiana in the south, is also at risk of flooding. The authorities have decided on all measures so that residents there can quickly evacuate upon receiving a warning. Although the Ohio River's water level has begun to recede, there is a shortage of drinking water, the climate is harsh, and there are places where epidemics may break out. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Cairo The Ohio River's water level is still five feet below the dikes here today, so the military commander still hopes that the city will be safe. However, there is a dike break north of Cairo, which has affected the town of Monte. (National News dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Europe's Coasts Hit by Wind and Snow</h3>
<p>British Naval Exercises Temporarily Canceled</p>
<p>[Paris] Storms, floods, and ice have struck the coasts of Europe today. The storms are particularly severe on the coast of Portugal. Traffic has been disrupted in most towns in Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria. British naval exercises in the Mediterranean have also been temporarily canceled. (National News dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[London] Floods and storms are wreaking havoc across Europe today, and temperatures have fallen below freezing. The Thames River has flooded its banks, reaching heights of nine feet in some areas. A storm has passed through the Shetland Islands. Eastern Europe and the area around Austria and the Black Sea are experiencing wind and snow, and traffic has been disrupted. Portugal is also experiencing floods. The British cruisers "Orion" and "Neptune" were damaged in the Strait of Gibraltar. In Poland, the flu is rampant due to the climate. (National News dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar The weather here is terrible, with gale-force winds reaching 97 miles per hour, causing great damage to the town and shipping. The British Steamship Company has prepared lodging for 160 passengers tonight because the hotels in Gibraltar are full. Even the lounges and reading rooms have been converted into bedrooms.

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Continues Debate on National Defense Issues</h3>
<p>Actively Promote Highway Construction; Border Defense is Already Fearless</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies continued its debate on national defense this morning. Presiding over the session were Vice-Speaker and Communist Party member Duguello. Representing the government were Minister of National Defense Daladier, Minister of Aviation Guy La Chambre, and Minister of the Navy Gascni du Park. Deputy Pogiede from the Eastern region, speaking on behalf of the border residents, requested the government to undertake two tasks simultaneously: first, the mechanization of the army, and second, the construction of a vast highway network. He pointed out that Germany had already built 25,000 kilometers of highways and planned to build 7,000 kilometers of motorways, all with a width of 20 to 30 meters, at a cost of between 22 and 30 billion francs. In contrast, French highway policy adheres to outdated methods, with a width of only 15 meters, and the annual budget is a mere 300 million francs, which pales in comparison to Germany. Right-wing Democratic Party member Shapdelan then spoke, stating that France had spent a total of 57 billion francs on national defense in recent years, while Germany had spent 150 billion francs. Moreover, the Soviet Union's national defense budget for the current year has reached as much as 95 billion francs. Given this situation, the 40-hour work week should not be applied to the defense industry to accelerate the manufacturing of military equipment. The deputy then expressed concern about the strength of border defenses. Minister of National Defense Daladier replied, "Border defense fortifications are complete. Even if the enemy launches a surprise attack on a holiday, we have nothing to fear." At this point, Radical Party member Bodou rose to speak, advocating for a more rapid mobilization of troops and praising Minister of National Defense Daladier's contributions to modernizing the army, comparing him to his predecessors. The deputies applauded in agreement. Subsequently, Left-wing Democratic Party member Gokiro questioned the government, stating that it takes six years to build an armored battleship in France, while Germany only needs two to three years, a significant difference. National Republican Union Party member Weideman demanded the strengthening of air defense facilities. The Chamber then adjourned until 3:30 PM. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Cabinet Crisis</h3>
<p>Vandervelde Resigns</p>
<p>Brussels – A cabinet crisis occurred in Belgium today. The renowned socialist veteran and giant of public health, Vandervelde, was instructed by the Labor Party Executive Committee to withdraw from the cabinet because Vandervelde had disagreements with other cabinet members, especially Foreign Minister Spaak (also a socialist), regarding Spanish affairs. After the Belgian diplomat Pocheglav was killed in Madrid, the Belgian government took a very stern stance towards Spain, which Vandervelde strongly opposed. Although no other Labor Party cabinet members are willing to follow Vandervelde's example, Vandervelde's resignation suggests that the coalition government of the Belgian Catholic Party, Socialist Party, and Liberal Party may disintegrate as a result. However, it is generally believed that the government's fate can still be preserved for now. The current cabinet was formed by the Catholic Party's Janson on June 12, 1936. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Ugaki's Cabinet Formation Reaches a Delicate Stage</h3>
<p>Failed to Meet with the Three Army Chiefs; Still Says He Intends to Make a Final Effort</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Ugaki's confidant, Kiyotake Imaida, visited Terauchi this morning. Terauchi told him that the Army's attitude had not changed and that it would be of little use for Ugaki to meet with the three Army chiefs. However, Ugaki, disregarding everything, was still planning the best strategy this afternoon in hopes of breaking the current deadlock. However, no one can determine whether there will be any success. It is now widely believed that Ugaki has no other option but to resign from his mission to form a cabinet. The Army's strong attitude was unexpected by most people, and Ugaki's unwillingness to easily abandon his cabinet plan is also surprising. Since receiving the mandate to form a cabinet, Ugaki has not left his house for four days, except for visiting Terauchi, Nagano, and Yuasa. His relaxed attitude is extremely rare. Furthermore, although the political situation is unstable, senior officials are consulting, and political parties are keeping silent, intending to avoid aggravating political disputes and difficulties in order to resolve the current cabinet crisis. This is also a phenomenon that has not occurred in any previous political changes in Japan. (Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] People generally fear that there is no room for the situation to improve. The Army believes that Ugaki's cabinet formation will inevitably fail. Army Vice-Minister Umezu told the press that he believes that if Ugaki is indeed a great politician, he should resign from his mission to form a cabinet. He also said that the entire Army opposes Ugaki personally, so there is no need to listen to Ugaki's policies. (Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to the Army, the military has repeatedly explained the internal situation to General Ugaki. Although General Ugaki requested a meeting with the three chiefs, the Army's attitude will not change in any way. The Army's work of streamlining the military is now complete. If there is any infighting within the department, it will be detrimental to both sides. General Ugaki should be aware of this situation and resign from his mandate as the best course of action. (Domei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Grand Chamberlain Hyakutake, Chief Aide-de-Camp Minami, and Interior Minister Yuasa entered the palace successively between 8:00 and 9:00 AM this morning. (Domei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At 7:50 PM on the 28th, General Ugaki told people at the cabinet formation headquarters that the situation has now reached a critical juncture. Since starting the formation of the cabinet, a considerable amount of time has passed. However, having worked so hard to find a way out, he will naturally strive to fulfill his duty to the end. (Domei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Considering Two or Three Methods</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Delay Further; Not Waiting for the Military's Reply</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Kiyotake Imaida stated at the cabinet formation headquarters at 2:30 PM on the 28th that it is unlikely that General Ugaki will meet with Army authorities at this time. Also, there is no decision on whether he will enter the palace today. He has no plans to visit anywhere as General Ugaki's envoy or to invite anyone from the outside. The matter of indefinite delay is being carefully considered, and he sincerely hopes to avoid further delays. They are still considering everything as before, but cannot express anything specific. Although there have been no external changes since Minister Terauchi's meeting with him, two or three methods among the various methods that have been considered have emerged as a result of the meeting with Minister Terauchi. Regarding whether they will further engage with Army authorities and whether General Ugaki's state of mind is the same as before his meeting with Minister Terauchi, or has changed, and whether the situation will continue as such if they no longer engage with Army authorities, all these points are in a very delicate state and cannot be expressed. However, he can report that they are not waiting for a reply from the military authorities. He also cannot report whether there is hope of obtaining the position of Minister of War. (Domei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Kiyotake Imaida visited Minister Terauchi at his residence at 10:00 AM on the 28th, stating that General Ugaki still hopes to meet with the three chiefs. Minister Terauchi replied that the results of the meeting of the three chiefs on the 26th had been answered, and the situation has not changed even today. Even if the three chiefs met with General Ugaki, he believes it would be difficult to meet his expectations, as the Army's attitude remains strong, and even a meeting would be ineffective. After speaking, Imaida returned to the cabinet formation headquarters and stated that he had visited Minister Terauchi on General Ugaki's orders, but the content cannot be reported at this time. Whether General Ugaki can meet with Minister Terauchi again has not been decided. Regarding the relationship with the Army, it cannot be said that there has been any special change from yesterday's situation, and there is nothing to wait for in the future. He only went as an envoy, and whether there were any results cannot be clearly reported. Minister Terauchi is unlikely to have a reply. He has no plans to visit anyone else in the Army's leadership besides the Minister of War. (Domei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The following is the situation of the questions and answers between General Ugaki's Chief of Staff for Cabinet Formation, Kiyotake Imaida, and the press corps at the cabinet formation headquarters at 8:00 PM on the 28th:</p>
<p>Q: Has the overall situation turned in the direction of resignation?</p>
<p>A: It is not appropriate to answer other than to state General Ugaki's state of mind.</p>
<p>Q: Is there still hope for breaking the deadlock in the situation?</p>
<p>A: This matter is being carefully considered, but it is unlikely that we will ask for more time.</p>
<p>Q: Are you planning to go out tonight?</p>
<p>A: Neither General Ugaki nor I are planning to go out, and no one from the outside is invited to come here.</p>
<p>Q: Have you not taken extraordinary measures yet?</p>
<p>A: We are trying to solve the problem in a fair and aboveboard manner as much as possible and do not want to take extraordinary measures.</p>
<p>Q: If the cabinet formation fails, will it not be possible to resolve the situation, have you considered this?</p>
<p>A: Although I have not thought about it that way, because the situation is extremely serious, success in forming the cabinet should be considered the final service. In any case, we must strive to maintain coordination in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>Q: The so-called coordination methods have largely come to naught, what is to be done?</p>
<p>A: That is largely the case, but some means of coordination still remain. We will exert our last efforts until they are exhausted, and we should consider this to be General Ugaki's responsibility.</p>
<p>Q: Has the negotiation with the Army ended?</p>
<p>A: I am afraid that we will no longer consult with the Army. (Domei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Legal Resolution</h3>
<p>Difficult to Implement in Practice</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After General Ugaki met with the Yuasa government on the 27th and reported the difficulties in forming a cabinet, he discussed the aftermath with Kiyotake Imaida. In view of the serious situation, he decided to complete the cabinet formation, believing that this was the most appropriate measure. Regarding the policy of completing the cabinet formation, obtaining a candidate to succeed the Minister of War was a prerequisite. Therefore, Ugaki decided to meet with former Minister of War Terauchi and Inspector General Sugiyama today, or at a joint meeting of the three chiefs, to earnestly request the recommendation of a candidate for Minister of War and to cooperate with the Army in a cooperative attitude to overcome the difficulties. (Domei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Because the Army's attitude remained consistently strong, making implementation impossible, the cabinet formation headquarters invited the Director-General of the Legislation Bureau, Daisaburo Tsugita, on the 26th and 27th to discuss legal solutions. On the morning of the 28th, Director-General Tsugita was again invited for a legal study on the selection of the Minister of War, attracting general attention. The results will be explained legally as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ According to Article 9 of the Cabinet Ordinance, if a minister of a department has a problem, the minister of another department may temporarily hold the position or be ordered to manage the affairs. According to this interpretation, it is not illegal to order the minister of another department to manage the affairs of the Minister of War at the time of cabinet formation.</p>
<p>㊁ Since the three Army chiefs have notified that it is impossible to recommend a successor to the Minister of War, it is legally possible for General Ugaki to negotiate directly with his intended person and appoint him as the Minister of War without the recommendation of the three chiefs.</p>
<p>Although the first method is not illegal, it cannot be applied in practice because it concerns the military. Although the second theory has possibilities, in terms of practical problems, if there is no understanding from the military, it will be difficult to maintain control within the department when appointing the Minister of War. Therefore, Ugaki seems to still be negotiating with the military to find a solution. (Domei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Based on the decision of the meeting of the three Army chiefs, the Army authorities issued a formal reply to General Ugaki. Former Minister of War Terauchi believes that the negotiation between the Army and General Ugaki to form a cabinet has ended with this final means, and he does not place any expectations on future developments. He also believes that the issue to be resolved in the future is how to satisfactorily resolve the difficult situation that will arise after General Ugaki resigns from his mandate, and he regards the abortion of the Ugaki cabinet as merely a matter of time. General Ugaki has lost the Army's cooperation. How will he proceed with the current cabinet? According to some sources, his methods are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ He will seek a person from among the generals or lieutenant generals other than the candidates recommended by the three Army chiefs and request him to join the cabinet.</p>
<p>㊁ He will revise the current ordinance so that generals or lieutenant generals of the reserve and retired armies can also serve as Minister of War.</p>
<p>㊂ He will specially order the generals or lieutenant generals of the reserve and retired armies to return to active duty in order to allow them to join the cabinet.</p>
<p>㊃ When an imperial edict is issued to the military minister, Minister Terauchi will remain in office.</p>
<p>However, it is actually difficult to implement these methods. If General Ugaki forcibly implements these methods, it is not known whether a particularly worrying situation will occur. There is also a saying that a civilian official will act as the Minister of War and manage military affairs, but this measure is extremely dangerous for Ugaki. According to the Army, General Ugaki will never consider such measures for the sake of his reputation. Thus, General Ugaki's work of forming a cabinet has encountered a fatal obstacle due to the strong opposition of the military, so its abortion is inevitable. (Domei News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Austria Establish Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>Large Increase in Trade Volume</p>
<p>[Vienna] Foreign Minister Schmidt recently signed an economic agreement between Germany and Austria with German Ambassador Papen. The main points of the agreement stipulate that: ㊀ The quantity of Austrian agricultural products, especially livestock, butter, milk, timber, and equipment required for the metallurgical industry, exported to Germany should be increased. ㊁ Germany and Austria will encourage people to travel and visit each other. ㊂ The quantity of coal and industrial manufactured goods produced in Germany exported to Austria should be increased. Regarding this matter, an official announcement stated that the volume of trade between Germany and Austria will greatly increase in accordance with this agreement. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Vienna] After the signing of the German-Austrian economic agreement, it was rumored that Germany intends to supply Austria with aviation machinery for offsetting debts. Political figures here recently declared that even if this statement is true, the aviation machinery that Germany can supply must be limited, as the German-Austrian economic agreement has a certain limit on the offsetting debt methods of both parties, and the amount is not huge. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>General Ugaki Is Well-Prepared and Calm</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] General Ugaki, who has tasted deep suffering and is confined to the upper floor of the cabinet formation headquarters, came downstairs after breakfast and took a walk in the inner garden. Seeing the plum blossoms in full bloom, he felt a sense of leisure. He was immediately surrounded by newspaper reporters and asked, "How is the situation?" He replied, "I enjoy taking walks in the morning and evening. Since forming the cabinet, I have been confined to the upper floor and have not exercised, so I feel full in the abdomen, have a poor appetite, and my head also feels heavy. Although it is difficult for me to come up with a good plan, my ambition to form a cabinet has not weakened at all. Since the situation is already like this, my persistence may be helpful." Then, he changed the subject, saying, "I have another grandson." From forming the cabinet, he thought of his second daughter, Hideko, who had given birth to a healthy boy, and his worried expression seemed to lessen slightly. The general continued, "Naming the grandson is very difficult. Should I take the two characters 'cabinet formation'?" He then said that this was a joke, and if he did, he would surely be resented by his daughter. After speaking, he laughed non-stop and then toured the country before going upstairs.

<h3>League of Nations Closes; French-Turkish Agreement Concluded</h3>
<p>[Geneva] The 96th regular session of the League of Nations Council held its last public meeting at 8:00 PM tonight to conclude various issues.

<p>[Geneva] The issue of the Turkish minority in the two cities of Alexandretta and Antioch within Syria, the so-called Sanjak region, has been resolved by France and Turkey concluding an agreement, and Rapporteur Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler drafted a report and submitted it to the League of Nations Council for review. At the Council meeting this afternoon, the report was submitted for a vote and passed unanimously. The solution is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The two cities of Alexandretta and Antioch, the so-called Sanjak region, enjoy complete autonomy in internal affairs, but foreign affairs are handled by the Syrian state. Furthermore, the currency system and tariff system of the region should also be the same as those of Syria.</p>
<p>㊁ Turkish should be the official language in the Sanjak region. As for the conditions under which other languages can be used, it will be decided by the League of Nations Council at a later date.</p>
<p>㊂ Any steps taken by the Syrian state in international affairs that are related to the internal autonomy of the Sanjak region must first be clearly approved by the League of Nations Council.</p>
<p>㊃ Syria and the Sanjak region will be contacted by special commissioners.</p>
<p>㊄ The League of Nations Council will appoint a French representative to ensure the implementation of the administrative system of the Sanjak region. The representative has the right to decide to suspend the implementation of the resolutions of the Sanjak legislative body, but only for a period of four months.</p>
<p>㊅ No troops will be stationed in the Sanjak region, and the implementation of compulsory military service and the construction of military projects in the region are prohibited.</p>
<p>㊅ France and Turkey should conclude a treaty in the future to jointly guarantee the territorial integrity of the Sanjak region and the inviolability of the existing borders of Syria.</p>
<p>㊇ Special clauses should be established stipulating that Turkey should enjoy preferential rights in the port of Alexandretta.</p>
<p>㊈ The administrative system of the Sanjak region will take effect immediately after being passed by a two-thirds majority of the League of Nations Council. France guarantees the implementation of this system until the end of its mandate for the Syrian mandate.</p>
<p>At the Council meeting today to review the above report, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüşdü and French Foreign Minister Delbos both stated that this new agreement will further strengthen the friendship between France and Turkey. Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov also spoke in succession, expressing their delight at the conclusion of the agreement between France and Turkey.

<h3>Radek's Confession: Trotsky Conspired with Germany to Incite the Russo-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Claiming an outbreak is possible this year. The Russian reactionary case's trial concludes. Trotsky's second son arrested in Russia.</p>
<p>[Moscow] During the ongoing trial of the renowned Soviet Russian journalist Radek and sixteen other former high-ranking Soviet officials today, Radek predicted that war would break out between Japan and Russia within the year. According to Radek's confession, he received a phone call from the former Deputy People's Commissar of Heavy Industry, Pyatakov, stating that Trotsky had conspired with Germany to incite this war, with the approximate intended time being within 1937. Radek continued, stating that according to Pyatakov, the German side needed a year for diplomatic preparations, but their military preparations were already complete. The German side desired Britain to remain neutral and demanded complete freedom of action in the Danube region and the Balkans. The former head of the Soviet Russian Railway Bureau, Kniazev, also testified regarding the matter, stating that the Japanese views were quite consistent with those mentioned in Radek's confession.</p>
<p>[Moscow] Regarding the counter-revolutionary "Parallel Center" case, the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court yesterday questioned the defendant Kniazev. He confessed, "I organized a Trotskyist counter-revolutionary organization and sabotaged railways in the southern Ural province, causing 1,500 accidents in 1934 and 2,000 accidents in 1935. I also worked for the Japanese intelligence agency in 1934, providing them with secret information given to me by another defendant, Livshits (former director of the Southern Railway Bureau and Deputy People's Commissar of Transportation). In 1936, a Japanese spy moved to Moscow and ordered me to hide poisonous bacteria in the army's food depot, for which I was paid 15,000 rubles." Another defendant, Radek, confessed that he was ordered by the defendant Pyatakov to blow up several chemical plants and maintain contact with the German intelligence agency. With the interrogation of the seventeen defendants completed, the court immediately prohibited public attendance and ordered experts to submit reports. It is claimed that the damage to the railway locomotives and the explosions in the factories were very minor, due to the defendants' perfunctory performance of the sabotage work. (Havas Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] It is rumored that Trotsky's second son, Sedov, a Bolshevik leader in Soviet Russia who is currently working as an engineer at the Krasnoyarsk factory, has been arrested today on charges of plotting to poison the factory workers. There has been no official announcement regarding this action by the government, but the resolution passed by the workers of the Krasnoyarsk factory can be considered factual evidence. The resolution stated, "The Fascist henchman Trotsky's son Sedov attempted to use poisonous gas to annihilate the last group of workers. We have applied to the Supreme Court to exterminate these specially sent vermin." (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Mexico. Trotsky stated today regarding the arrest of his second son, Sedov, in Russia that this was an act of revenge. After imprisonment, he will likely be subjected to unbearable torture. This kind of action is truly in Stalin's nature; my two daughters have already died at his hands. Trotsky also published an article in the newspaper, declaring that the confessions made by the seventeen former high-ranking Soviet officials in the Moscow public trial were entirely fabricated and inconsistent with space and time.

<h3>Stalin Prevents Assassination</h3>

<p>[Berlin] According to Moscow sources, an assassination plot against Stalin was discovered on January 22nd. Two electricians were attacked while planting a bomb. Shapilo, a guard at the Kremlin, was awarded the Order of the Red Star by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union for his meritorious service. The award order declared that Shapilo had strived in his struggle against counter-revolutionary activities and made outstanding contributions. Therefore, Stalin moves his office daily.

<h3>Situation of Germans in Morocco</h3>
<p>Melilla Airport - No Outsiders Allowed</p>
<p>[London] The captain of the British warship "Veronica" was recently invited by Colonel Bebade, the Spanish High Commissioner of Morocco, to visit the ports of Ceuta and Melilla in Spanish Morocco to investigate any German activity. Regarding this matter, Liberal Member of Parliament, Mandell, recently raised a question to the government, which was answered by Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, stating that the captain of the "Veronica" had visited the ports of Ceuta and Melilla accompanied by the British Consul in Tetouan. No evidence was obtained regarding the stationing of German troops in the Ceuta and Tetouan port areas. The Spanish High Commissioner of Morocco also declared that, apart from a small number of Germans in the Spanish foreign legion, the German expatriates in Tetouan were all members of commercial organizations and were studying trade issues between Spanish Morocco and Germany. In addition, no evidence was obtained regarding the construction of barracks in the port of Ceuta to house German troops; only recently built workers' residences were seen in the area. Furthermore, the commander of the Spanish fortress in the port of Melilla declared to the British captain that the port and its hinterland were not prepared to receive German troops. All the Germans at the airfield there were engaged in aviation affairs, and their numbers changed daily, making it impossible to determine. Generally, there were a total of 150 Germans, but the Melilla port authorities did not allow the British captain to visit the airfield and did not explain the reason. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Convenes North China Economic Development Conference in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Military, South Manchuria Railway, and Consulate Personnel Participate. Decide on New Budget, Organize Tanggu Port Construction, etc.</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The North China Economic Development Conference, convened in Tianjin by the Japanese Garrison in North China, the Tianjin Consulate General, the Tianjin branch of the Xingzhong Corporation, and the Industry Department of the South Manchuria Railway Company, opened on January 25th at the Japanese military headquarters in Haiguang Temple. Attending were South Manchuria Railway Company Director and Industry Department Head Sakatani, along with Deputy Director Okumura, Seira, General Affairs Section Chief Oshikawa, Commerce and Industry Director Momma, East Asia Section Chief Miyamoto, Secretary Nakajima, Participating Official Tadokoro, and over 20 investigators. South Manchuria Railway's Beijing Office Representative Aruga Renkichi also rushed to attend. At 9:00 AM that morning, they gathered at the Japanese military headquarters in Haiguang Temple to hold a meeting. The military participants included Chief of Staff Hashimoto, Senior Staff Officer and First Section Chief Iida, Second/Third Section Chiefs Wachi and Ikeda, Economic Advisor Department Head Lieutenant Colonel Nagamine, Staff Officers Tsukada and Asai, and over ten related military personnel. The consulate participants included Commercial Consul Hagiwara and Vice Consul Nagai. South Manchuria Railway's Tianjin and Beijing Office Representatives Aruga and Nonaka, and Xingzhong Corporation Representatives Hirayama and Kiyono, attended, totaling over 40 attendees. Presided over by Hashimoto, the conference discussed the North China economic development plan created last year, broadly divided into: 1. The current situation of the Chinese political situation after the Xi'an Incident and its economic impact; 2. Recent trends in the Hebei-Chahar Political Council; 3. The current status of North China's economic development; 4. The South Manchuria Railway's five-year industrial development plan; 5. Trends in rural cooperative enterprises; 6. Methods for implementing coal chemical liquefaction; 7. Issues concerning North China's railway, mining, and water conservancy development; 8. Exploration of cotton cultivation and raw cotton export. During the meeting, each participant expressed their opinions as much as possible on behalf of their respective organizations. The meeting broke for lunch at noon and resumed at 2:00 PM, adjourning at 8:00 PM. Tashiro then hosted a banquet at his official residence. At 10:00 AM on the 26th, the meeting continued at the same location, focusing on practical current work issues, thoroughly discussing them based on the results of the 25th meeting, and adjourning at noon. This meeting is extremely important in relation to North China's economic development. Since the military and Xingzhong Corporation had disagreements, refusing Xingzhong's direct investment in North China, and the South Manchuria Railway, which is closely linked to Xingzhong, insisted on opposing the military at all times, discussions about North China's economic problems have suddenly cooled since last October. The reason for this is that the domestic military has recently become more active in its policy on economic development in North China, and has made every effort to resolve the opinions between the Tianjin military and the South Manchuria Railway and reconcile them. Therefore, after both sides discussed via letters and telegrams, exchanged opinions, and reached a consensus, this gathering was held in Tianjin. After this round of discussions, North China's economic development issues will shift from silence to noise, and the implementation of various current matters is likely to begin. According to Nonaka Tokio, the Investigation Section Chief of the South Manchuria Railway's Tianjin office, the content of the two-day meeting was due to the fact that both China and Japan had previously created a plan for developing North China's economy last year. Subsequently, due to disagreements, the budget was too large, making it difficult to implement practically. Furthermore, although the Hebei-Chahar authorities provided assistance, there were many difficulties, making it impossible to fully implement. Currently, the military, consulate, and South Manchuria Railway believe that it is necessary to reconvene to discuss various matters to be organized. Therefore, a meeting was convened to discuss and revise the budget for matters such as: 1. Tanggu port construction; 2. Construction of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway; 3. Opening of the Longyan Iron Mine. They will try to reduce the budget and re-evaluate separately. Once the funds are concentrated, they will be handled sequentially. In addition, the major gain is that the military and the South Manchuria Railway have reached a consensus.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the 26th, Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Chen Juesheng, the director of the Beijing-Liaoning Railway Bureau, visited Commander Tashiro at his official residence in Zhangyuan. During the talks, they discussed the current situation, diplomacy, and economic cooperation. The restoration of the Longyan Iron Mine, the commencement of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway, the export of raw cotton, and cotton production improvements were all discussed. Tashiro expressed the intent of this Tianjin meeting to Song, stating that the authorities have decided to carry out cooperation based on the principle of mutual benefit for existing projects.

<h3>Continued Report on Guangdong Ferry Sinking Case</h3>
<p>Statistics show that 284 bodies have been recovered for several days. Transported in batches to Guangzhou and Jiangmen, numbered for identification. Organizations in Xinhui send a telegram requesting the bombing of the GanZhuTan rocks.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The "Minzu" ferry operating between Guangzhou and Jiangmen in Guangdong Province recently sank in Ganzhutan, which is under the jurisdiction of Shunde County, drowning nearly three hundred people. The situation has been reported in detail. As of the 24th, a total of 284 bodies of passengers who died in the accident had been recovered. The deceased were trapped inside the ship's cabins for two days and nights, so when they were retrieved, all the bodies were swollen and deformed, and some had seven orifices bleeding. A crane was used to lift the sunken ship, and after a day, half of the ship's body was pulled out of the water on the 22nd. Sixty-seven bodies were found on the top floor. On the 23rd, the entire ship was floated to the surface, and a total of 268 bodies were found in the public cabins and dining rooms, including 135 male bodies and 133 female bodies. Most of the deceased were from the Siyi region. Those with relatives in the county and rural areas were transported to Jiangmen to facilitate identification by relatives nearby. Therefore, on the 24th, 151 bodies were first transported to Jiangmen, and several dozen were taken by the families of the deceased near Ganzhutan. The remaining 110 bodies were transported back to Guangzhou by boat on the 24th, arriving at the provincial river around 10:00 PM. They were docked in front of the Haitong Temple pier in Henan, and then transported to the Yuxi Fangbian Hospital Gaogang for placement by freight trucks. When the bodies were brought ashore, dozens of relatives of the deceased were waiting. Six bodies were immediately taken away, and the remaining 107 bodies were sent to the open space in Gaogang, numbered for identification. On the 25th, hundreds of relatives of the deceased arrived at Gaogang in front of Fangbian Hospital, searching for bodies with tears in their eyes. Those who had been identified were prepared for burial by their families. On that day, a total of seven male bodies and thirteen female bodies were claimed, with more than ninety bodies remaining to be identified. If the deadline of the 26th is exceeded, the bodies will be hastily buried by Fangbian Hospital in the Julonggang cemetery. This ship suffered a tragic sinking, drowning over 280 passengers. The disaster was serious, and the Navigation Administration and the Provincial Party Department both sent personnel to investigate the situation and the incident. Local people are painfully determined to advocate for the bombing of the shoal rocks to ensure a permanent solution and to seek welfare for navigation. Yesterday, the Xinhui County Chamber of Commerce representative Mr. Lu, the citizen representative Mr. Zhao, and more than ten organizations such as the Xinhui County Party Department and the County Farmers' Association sent a telegram to the authorities requesting the bombing of the shoal to benefit navigation. After receiving the telegram, the Water Conservancy Bureau plans to first send a surveying team of Chinese and Western engineers to conduct an on-site survey of Ganzhutan, formulate a plan to bomb the shoal rocks, and submit it to the Central Hydraulic Engineering Testing Institute to send personnel for re-measurement. The estimated labor cost is 100,000 yuan. This unprecedented tragedy has left many relatives of the victims without support, affecting their lives. It is reported that they have united to appeal to the authorities to provide generous compensation to comfort the wronged souls and resettle the orphans and widows of the victims. (January 26th)</p>

Bureau Chief Zhang has also summoned the branch chiefs to conduct detailed investigations and personally inspect the police districts of each bureau, making appropriate additions and deletions. It was decided to officially establish them at the beginning of next month. However, due to the insufficient allocation of student police in each district, the branch bureaus have also been ordered to select special police officers and police sergeants with excellent academics to send to the bureau today for examination, selecting the best to be promoted as student police in the police district.</p>
<p>Investigate Laborers' Lives</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry believes that the hardships of laborers' lives are greatly related to national health and work efficiency. The labor disputes that arise are especially sufficient to affect social peace and enterprise development. Therefore, it has long taken the improvement of workers' lives and the promotion of labor-management coordination as key policy guidelines. Recently, in order to achieve these two tasks, it has specially dispatched personnel to conduct on-site investigations of laborers' wages, actual income, and living conditions in cities and counties with developed industries. It has now decided to start investigations in seven locations, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuxi. The provincial government was consulted to instruct the county to conduct the investigations. After receiving the order, Wuxi County Magistrate Long ordered the Construction and Investigation Bureau to fill out the worker wage registration forms and worker wage tables and submit statistics. The bureau has already selected eight factories that comply with the Factory Law among the various factories, including Shenxin Textile Factory, Lixin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Gengyu Cloth Factory, Maoxin Flour Factory, Hengde Oil Factory, Zhonghua Socks Factory, Huaxin Silk Factory, and Gongyi Machinery Factory, to investigate and fill out the forms completely from January and submit them to the bureau for reporting.</p>

<h3>The Eastern Wind and Rain…The Northern Clouds and Mountains (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Mingxin</p>
<p>Having completed our journey to Luoyang and with matters requiring a northern expedition, and wishing to avoid Zhengzhou again, we crossed from Tongguan at Fenglingdu into Shanxi Province. What was spoken of above concerns the wind and rain of the two mausoleums; what is recorded below concerns the clouds and mountains of the three Jin states. Leaving behind the chaos of war in Luoyang, we entered the peaceful and prosperous land of Shanxi. A single crossing of the Yellow River brought about a change in scenery, and our feelings were stirred.</p>
<p>Fenglingdu is located at the west gate of Tongguan, with the border of Shanxi on the opposite bank. It is also the endpoint of the Datong-Puzhou Railway. There are boats at the ferry that can carry heavy loads several times a day. The reporter crossed the river at 4 p.m. The river is not wide, but there are breaks in the water, making the boat journey circuitous and time-consuming. The north bank was also a rising tide flat, requiring us to wade. A single ox cart reached the shore from the boat, making travel through the muddy ground particularly inconvenient. Fortunately, the foundation for the railway bridge is already laid, and in a few months, the bridge will be passable, eliminating the need for boats. The Datong-Puzhou Railway is a narrow-gauge railway built by Shanxi Province itself, costing the least amount of money and achieving the most significant success. The engineering is extremely simple, but in these times of impoverished people and depleted resources, the convenience of transportation is sufficient. There is no need to pursue further extravagance. Passenger cars are all third class. From the ferry to Taiyuan, it is over 500 kilometers, a journey of 24 hours, with a fare of only 8.75 yuan. The car is exceptionally clean, and the attendants are also well-trained. However, the long journey makes it difficult to sleep, and one feels the weariness of the journey. The train departs at 7 p.m., climbing up the mountain with back-and-forth pulling and pushing, similar to the old system on the Ping-Sui Railway's Nankou section. Along the way, from southern Shanxi to the heartland, there are many famous cities and prosperous areas. Places passed such as Jiexiu and Taigu are where ticket shops and merchants are concentrated. The city walls are also grand and beautiful. The Lingishi area is rich in coal deposits. Hongdong is the former site of Yu Tangchun (a famous Chinese opera character), well-known to those who love theater, and sufficient to inspire fine sentiment. The land in southern Shanxi is fertile, and every family is well-provided for. Having not experienced war for a hundred years, they have been able to fully cultivate and prosper. With joyous and contented faces, the elderly and children alike enjoy the pleasure of being full and satisfied. Many of the passengers on the train are local merchants traveling. People from other provinces coming to the provincial capital mostly take the Zhengtai Railway, rarely traveling north from the ferry. The education and political figures encountered in the train are mostly those receiving training in the provincial capital. They all appear energetic and talk about border affairs, sometimes with passionate outbursts. They also know that government affairs in various places are extremely well-organized. Yan Xishan's governance of Shanxi encourages diligence, prudence, loyalty, and responsibility. He not only promotes government affairs but also focuses on the training of the people of the province. The train arrives at the provincial capital at 7 a.m. the next day. From afar, one can see the large building of the provincial cigarette company. Northern Shanxi produces wild tobacco leaves, and even cigarettes made from them are quite fragrant. Shanxi prioritizes using products from the province, and many supplies are manufactured within the province. This is in the category of consumption, and it is appropriate that they are self-sufficient. The Zhengtai Railway station is at the south gate, while the Datong-Puzhou Railway is at the east gate. There are police officers asking questions, but they are very polite and do not cause any trouble. I took a rickshaw into the city and checked into a hotel. The newly built Datong-Puzhou Railway Hotel is still under construction and will soon be completed, demonstrating the progress of the railway's management. After arriving at the hotel and washing away some of the dust from the journey, I heard the air raid drill siren. A city-wide blackout was implemented, and all security forces were mobilized. In the silence, I spoke privately with the attendant (speaking loudly was prohibited, also one of the drill's rules) and asked for his thoughts. The attendant said that the drills have been conducted more than once, and the people understand them. Although it is a test, everyone gains knowledge to prepare for any eventuality, which is a good thing. Soon after, I saw enemy planes approaching in the sky, circling overhead. The airport outside the north gate is equipped with searchlights, and anti-aircraft defense efforts were also mobilized. I also learned that during the drills, one-tenth of the personnel from the pacification headquarters and various departments remained on duty, three-tenths of the young staff went to temporary offices outside the city, and five-tenths were responsible for fire prevention and rescue. The entire process took about half an hour and was well-ordered. Yan Xishan even specially invited representatives from various counties and sectors to the province to observe, in preparation for similar exercises in various places.</p>
<p>The same day was the opening day for the training of county and district chiefs. Yan Xishan and Zhao Dai also attended and delivered speeches, emphasizing the need for a total mobilization of the people in the extraordinary period of national defense. District and county chiefs are the closest to the people and should first seek to facilitate the implementation of policies to achieve the effectiveness of total mobilization. The next day (the 21st) was designated as Public Servants' Responsibility Day. Yan Xishan and Zhao Dai convened a large meeting with parades and speeches. Yan Xishan has specific regulations for the evaluation of civil servants, with the "Shanxi-Suiyuan Civil Servants' Misconduct Law" having been approved by the central government last year on this day. This meeting was held on its anniversary to encourage self-reflection and promote awareness. The main tenets included: "Truly take responsibility for oneself and be a modern person" and "Absolutely do not allow people to avoid responsibility, take responsibility for oneself and be a good subordinate; force people to take responsibility and be a good superior." At the same time, citizens were required to raise the national flag in the morning. Citizens were divided into groups, and in the early morning, gongs were sounded on each street to summon them to assembly points for ceremonies and instructions. Yan Xishan has governed Shanxi for twenty-five years, setting a national example for integrity in internal affairs. With the current national crisis, the integrity of officials is even more important, so he spares no words to achieve results. For example, among the personnel appointments and removals by the provincial government, a technician from Qin County was suspended for one year due to the excessive death of sheep at the Construction Bureau, and the county magistrate of Taigu County was suspended for two years for falsely reporting tree planting. All these trivial matters were punished, and the speed and thoroughness of enforcement can be imagined. As for the cleanliness of the streets, the dedication of the police, the diligence of the people, and other virtues, all can be seen at a glance, without the need for interviews.</p>
<p>The provincial capital of Taiyuan occupies a vast area, and the city is very prosperous. The six or seven main streets are lined with shops. The northeast part of the city is mostly the private residences of local officials and gentry. The walls are thick and strong, and the pavilions are magnificent. Everything is set up to instill morals into the residents. As such, people are encouraged to go to bed early and rise early. After 10 p.m., there are few pedestrians on the main streets, and around 8 a.m., most shops open their doors. Military personnel and students are constantly training, and Yan Xishan pays particular attention to finance and economics, which are the foundation of modern nation-building. The promoted "local product exchange vouchers" have been implemented throughout the markets. Yan Xishan has a unique perspective on economic policy, believing that bartering goods and not recognizing the intrinsic value of gold and silver can promote production, increase national power, avoid financial crises, and break down the inequality between rich and poor. He has written extensively on this subject, with comprehensive references. As a result, local product exchange vouchers were issued. His original intention was only to use them as a price marker for goods, not to give the medium itself any value. In other words, it was to make it a receipt for bartering goods. However, as a result, although the province promotes provincial products, it cannot do without the import of foreign goods. Also, it is difficult to pay for labor with goods. Therefore, this receipt, in effect, is the same as the inconvertible paper money issued by the provincial treasury (the vouchers are backed by the provincial material reserves, and many of Shanxi's current industries are publicly owned, with products going to the provincial treasury, effectively implementing a control system to promote production). When the province is financially strong, issuing another type of paper money is not a problem. Moreover, within the province, it can reduce outflows, which is also a way to store wealth. However, considering the overall national economy and whether the export of provincial goods to the import of foreign goods results in a trade surplus or deficit, it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of this policy without longer-term testing.</p>

The number of players has been reduced from seventeen to fifteen. It is expected that there may still be changes after tomorrow's trial match. As for the Chinese team, they have been training hard for the past few days, and held a practice session at Zhongyuan yesterday morning. Tomorrow's match against the Ideal Team will also serve as a rigorous test of the lineup to go to Hong Kong to participate in the Chinese Interport Games.

<h3>Hankou Police Department Football Team to Visit Shanghai at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>To Challenge French Chamber of Commerce and Portugal</p>
<p>The Hankou City Police Department (i.e., Public Security Bureau) football team, which has been based in Central China for many years, has gained fame both north and south since participating in the Sixth National Games in 1935.

It is reported that the team will travel east at the end of this month to participate in the Leader Cup National Interport Small Football Tournament. At the same time, the team has already sent personnel to Shanghai to consult with the National Sports Association, intending to hold one or two friendly football matches during the Lunar New Year, with opponents likely to be the French Chamber of Commerce and Portugal.

<h3>First Match of Xiqing General Division Championship: Muir Defeats Yuezhong</h3>
<p>Yuezhong Dominated in the First Half, But Muir Came Back to Win. Score: 27 to 23. Second Match Tomorrow Night.</p>
<p>Muir and Yuezhong, the champions of the A and B divisions of the Xiqing General Division, met yesterday in the first match of the General Championship Week. Both teams were evenly matched, but their caution led to missed opportunities. After the jump ball, Muir's Shen Hanjun scored first, taking less than three seconds, showing great momentum. However, excessive caution led to inaccurate shots, while Yuezhong's Zhou Wenrong scored after Liu Zihui and Zhou Yaokang followed up, taking a 6-2 lead. From then on, they went with the flow and maintained the lead. Soon, Muir's Hua Yulin scored, and Yuezhong's Shen Jian continued with a free throw. Muir's Dong Yangfeng scored, closing the gap to 6-7. But soon, Yuezhong's Zhou Wenrong scored again, ending the first quarter with Yuezhong leading. The second quarter was very even, but both sides committed many fouls due to overexcitement. Yuezhong's Liu Zihui shot from afar, and Zhou Yaokang scored on a free throw, making the score 12-6, with Muir lagging behind by half. Muir's Huang Cunhou and Shen Hanjun scored twice, making the score 10-12, closing the gap again. Afterwards, the difference was only one point from 12-14, 13-15, to 15-17, with Yuezhong still leading. Then Yuezhong's Zhou Yaokang scored another free throw, ending the first half with 18-15, with Yuezhong still leading by three points. After the break, Muir's momentum increased. Hua Yulin and Dong Yangfeng took advantage of opportunities from both sides, increasing their score by seven points in one go, while Yuezhong missed several shots. By the end of this quarter, Yuezhong had scored nothing, while Muir had taken the lead 22-18. From then on, Muir led the way to the end of the match. In the final quarter, Muir's Dong Yangfeng scored first, while Yuezhong's Zhou Wenrong assisted under the basket. Then, after Muir's Hua Yulin scored on a free throw, Yuezhong's Shen Ji scored one move and one free throw, making the score 23-25, increasing the tension. But Muir's defense was tight, making it difficult for Yuezhong's players to get close to the basket. Yuezhong was also eager to win, and Shen Ji was penalized four times in a row and was sent off, becoming even more dejected. Zhou Yaokang had a rare opportunity under the basket, but missed slightly, further decreasing morale. After Yuezhong substituted Zhou Wenrui, there was little improvement. Muir's Dong Yangfeng scored again, and the final whistle blew, with Muir winning 27-23. The second match is scheduled for tomorrow night (Saturday). Muir only needs to win once more to win the championship, while Yuezhong needs to win twice to claim the title. The match time has been changed to 8:15 p.m. (originally scheduled for 6 p.m.).</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Cables Qin Dechun to Punish Northeast University Severely</h3>
<p>Suspends Funding to the School... Orders Zang Qifang to Return to Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency) The Ministry of Education, due to the fact that reactionary elements control Northeast University and refuse to accept reorganization, has not only cabled Zang Qifang to return to Nanjing, but also cabled Qin Dechun, Mayor of Beiping, stating: Mayor Qin, please note: Northeast University is manipulated by reactionary elements. The Ministry, out of concern for the youth of the Northeast, sent Zang Qifang and Lei Fa to reorganize the university, but Zhou Jingwen and others refused to accept the reorganization and led reactionary elements in expelling more than a hundred good students. These illegal and violent acts are truly regrettable. The Ministry has been extremely patient, hoping that they would deeply reflect on their actions and achieve a peaceful resolution, avoiding further complications. Now that the reorganization is difficult, the Ministry cannot but impose necessary sanctions on the school's deplorable situation. The Ministry has decided to suspend funding to the school and reject its illegal administration. It will separately seek appropriate relief for the teaching of the school's honest teachers and the studies of its good students. Besides informing Acting Principal Zang Qifang and instructing him to return to Nanjing to handle relief efforts, please inform Chairman Song and instruct Director Lei to assist. Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Military Academy Changes Teaching Methods for Chinese Students</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency) According to reports from a certain military agency, the attitude of the Japanese Army Military Academy towards Chinese students has worsened since the January 28th Incident. Before the January 28th Incident, all students entering the academy had to undergo a four-month internship in local regiments. This four-month practical experience had a great impact on Chinese students, and they could gain a general understanding of the military situation. After the January 28th Incident, the regiment internship was discontinued. Recently, Chinese students were all moved to the old site of the Army Ordnance School, completely separated from the Military Academy. This is nothing more than a lack of sincerity on the part of the Japanese authorities in educating Chinese students. Students studying at the Military Academy will no longer gain anything in the future.</p>
<h3>Normal University President Refuses to Allow Expelled Students to Return to School</h3>
<p>(Beiping, 28th) More than twenty students from the Normal University visited Li Zheng this morning, requesting him to rescind the expulsion order for Yan Shichen and five others.

<h3>Next Year, Hunan University Will Be Changed to National University</h3>

<h3>Nanjing Plans to Establish a Children's Education Center</h3>

<h3>Minister Chen Lijiang Talks About the Progress of the Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Chen Lijiang, Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education and Standing Committee Member of the Art Exhibition Committee, gave a speech on the recent import situation of the National Art Exhibition, saying that exhibits from all parties are being collected separately. Regarding ancient art, most will be selected from the Palace Museum in Beiping and the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall, and the committee has appointed Gu Shusen and Ma Heng to handle the matter. The Palace Museum has already started the selection process, and Mr. Ma Heng is also in contact with the Exhibition Hall and has gone to Beiping. As for individual exhibits, it was originally scheduled that educational departments in various provinces and cities would collect them and send them to the committee by the end of February. The second meeting of the Standing Committee, in order to be thorough, has sent letters to the local preparatory committees to assist the local educational departments in the collection. It is expected that more people will respond enthusiastically. As for the method of specially invited works, this year it will not be adopted, as decided by the preparatory committee. Regarding the aspect of exhibits, at the national art exhibitions held in England and France, having a work exhibited is the highest honor. The situation in our country is the same. We sincerely hope that domestic artists will contribute their best works and participate enthusiastically in this grand event.</p>
<h3>Meteorological Terminology Review Committee</h3>

<h3>Educational Film Association to Continue Educational Film Teaching in Spring</h3>
<p>Fee of Ten Yuan Collected from Each School</p>
<p>To promote educational film teaching, the Chinese Educational Film Association has specially selected teaching films in biology, physics, and chemistry suitable for middle school students to watch. In the spring and autumn of the 25th year, these films will be shown in middle schools along the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Beijing-Jiaozuo-Huainan lines in stages. Each school only needs to pay a fee of ten yuan per season. Schools are enthusiastically adopting this program. A total of thirty-two schools in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Shanghai, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Hefei, and other places are participating. The results of the screenings have been well-received by the schools. It is reported that the association's expenses for promoting educational films, including the salaries and travel expenses of the screening personnel, as well as the repair of machinery, the replacement of light bulbs, and film rental fees, exceed ten yuan. The income from the screening fees is limited, resulting in significant losses. The association continues to work hard to promote educational film teaching. As the spring semester begins, it is continuing to organize screenings and has sent letters to various schools for consultation. The following are the points to note for schools that adopt the association's spring educational film program:</p>
<p>㊀ Educational films are divided into three subjects: biology, physics, and chemistry. Films from each subject will still be shown in two stages this season. ㊁ Schools must avoid using the entire student body as the audience. Each student should not watch films from all three subjects continuously. Students studying biology this semester should watch biology films when they are shown, and the same applies to chemistry and physics films. ㊂ The association will send the instruction manuals for each subject's films to the schools in advance. Teachers from each school will be responsible for explaining the films along with the screening. If necessary, the association's screening personnel can also assist in the explanation. ㊃ The fee for spring educational films is ten yuan per school. ㊄ The screening schedule for each school will be pre-arranged by the association and notified in advance. Schools must not make any changes to avoid delaying the screening period for other schools. ㊅ Schools must provide black cloth curtains for the screening venue. The association will provide the screen, projector, and other equipment.</p>

<h3>Completion of the New Building of Changqiao Elementary School</h3>

The school building is magnificent, and the scenery is excellent, making it the best elementary school in Songjiang County. The education management is serious, and the tuition is low, which is beyond the reach of public and private elementary schools in this port. Recently, it was reported that the five newly built buildings of the school have been completed, accommodating one hundred boarding students.

The total cost for boarding students, including tuition and miscellaneous fees, is no more than sixty yuan. Because the school building was donated by the school board and does not require rent, tuition fees are reduced to benefit poor students. The school is also very conveniently located.</p>

<h3>First-Class Pistol Shooting Situation Tense, Zhang Yingda Wins the Final</h3>
<p>Yesterday, he defeated Qu Shimu with 1,000 points to 793. Today, Zhu Qiliang and Wu Chengxiang Will Compete for the Final Spot.</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda, a giant in Chinese pistol shooting, defeated Qu Shimu with a total of 1,000 points to 793 in two matches yesterday, winning the right to the finals of the Shanghai Amateur First-Class Pistol Shooting Championship. Today at 5:30 PM and 9:00 PM, Zhu Qiliang and left-handed general Wu Chengxiang will compete for the final spot in the Amateur Association at No. 88 Nanjing Road. From now on, this year's first-class championship has been grasped by the Chinese.</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda's skills are known for their fluency. Every shot he fires is a masterpiece. His performance in the first match yesterday was particularly good. The highest shot of 66 points that day was made at that time. In the middle of the second match, he was once hindered from advancing. Fortunately, the winning score was more than 200 points. Although it was slightly reduced, it still did not affect his future, and he finally won the final spot and returned. Qu Shimu is one of the best players in the British pistol shooting world. Judging from his steady progress in the second match, he is also a dangerous figure. Unfortunately, he had too many setbacks in the first match. Although he had the ambition to reverse his misfortune, he was ultimately unable to do so. In addition to Zhang's full performance of his all-around skills, the precision of several shots was indeed beyond the reach of ordinary people. Li Gongying is not in Shanghai, and Medina has been eliminated. In the first-class competition in the future, there will be few who can match him.</p>
<p>Zhang's record was excellent in the first match, exceeding 20 points eight times, while Qu Shimu only had two times. The situation can be imagined. At the end of the first match, Qu Shimu had 232, and Zhang had 480 at the last shot. At the beginning of the second match, Zhang still maintained a superior position. The largest distance was more than 240 points. Qu Shimu made several large numbers, and the difference was slightly closer. In the end, both of them had good performances. As a result, Zhang won by 207 points, with a score of 1,000 points to 793. Zhang Yingda (first match) 24•66•25•24•33•34•33•27• (second match) 36•48•21•20•35•34•55•31•34•</p>
<p>Qu Shimu (first match) 24•21•32•20•56•20•27•52•34•20•41•</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn Surge Re-ignites</p>
<p>Indian Merchants Continue to Pull Up, Three Products Also Rise High Many Parties See Excitement, February Up Two Yuan and Six</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending strong, and the surge has re-ignited. Moreover, the February rise is even stronger, because Indian merchants are pulling up the market and are not willing to let go. At the same time, three kinds of yarn and cotton have turned to higher prices, and market sentiment is even more excited. However, the current yarn business has not developed. Sellers among the industry have not stopped dumping. Also, because the settlement procedures for this month will be handled the next day, the market is closed for one day. Speculators, seeing the poor environment, painfully close out their positions, and the market is moving further.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Retailers Are Also Eager to Cover Short Positions In the spot yarn pre-market, all months rose uniformly, because the overseas yarn and cotton markets rose together, and people's hearts are particularly firm. In addition, Indian merchants are waiting for the February period to squeeze the market, so the momentum is even stronger. However, spot yarn trading is not strong, and the industry's thinking is inclined to selling. As a result, spot yarn prices for each month rose by 6.8 cents to 1 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon pre-market, the February market suddenly became tense, and the rising power was strong, because the big players waited and did not move on the next day's settlement suspension of the market for this month, and retailers were eager to cover short positions, so the market moved forward. As a result, February rose by 1 yuan and 6 cents compared with the closing price in the morning, and the far month rose by 9 cents to 1 yuan and 1 cent. It was found that 1,000 bales of Yuda were sold, 800 bales of Dafeng, 2,050 bales of Mingde, 600 bales of Changyu, 3,450 bales of Changfeng, 1,700 bales of Ruida, 750 bales of Taichang, 1,100 bales of Dachang, 850 bales of Jinchang were bought, 700 bales of Zhenda, 700 bales of Shenji, 2,250 bales of Renfeng, 700 bales of Taichang, 1,500 bales of Runkang, 400 bales of Yuda, 400 bales of Juxing, 450 bales of Yichang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>The Cotton Futures Market Changed Very Little</p>
<p>The Impact of the Flood on American Cotton Was Slightly Stimulated</p>
<p>The cotton market is also firm, and the rising wind has slightly risen. Because American cotton has been severely affected by the flood, and the cotton fields in the Mississippi River are at risk, the market price has an upward trend. Therefore, people's hearts have been stimulated by it. However, spot cotton consumption is stagnant.</p>
<p>Market Transactions are Very Few In the spot cotton pre-market, each month rose slightly. Because American cotton and Indian cotton have risen together, and Osaka Three Products also rose by 7.8 cents, people's hearts have been slightly shaken. However, market transactions are very few, and market prices have not changed significantly. As a result, spot cotton prices for each month rose by 5 cents to 1.5 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon pre-market, the market was slightly flat, because the yarn market continued to be good, and there was bullish news about American cotton, but buying interest was still scattered. As a result, February was the same as the closing price in the morning, and the rest rose by 5 cents. It was found that 2,000 dan of Dafu were sold, 1,500 dan of Changfeng, 5,500 dan of Dachang, 900 dan of Dachangcheng, 900 dan of Senkang, 800 dan of Tongji were bought, 800 dan of Jinchang, 700 dan of Wang Taixing, 800 dan of Changhe, 1,700 dan of Hexing, and 1,100 dan of Renfeng.

<p>Spot Cotton Clearing Fees are Mediocre Factory demand is quiet. The source is 1,410 bales of Yaohua and 1,588 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<p>Yuanfang Piece Goods Sales are Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 1,025th auction of Yuanfang Foreign Firm in this port. As the end of the year is approaching, customer transactions have stopped. According to regulations, the auction is scheduled. Trade in cash within one week. Because of the Lunar New Year, it is customary to open up for six weeks of cash delivery. Among the industry, because the market in the coming spring is ordinary, although the asking price for this period is extended, it is still mostly suppressed and rarely raised. Five kinds of Qinxizhou Satin, Yuanrong, Straight Ni, Gongchou, and Ocean Red Cloth, a total of 45 brands, and 67 boxes, were displayed. The asking price of Taixi Satin per yard was flat with the previous adjustment. Only the Lion Monkey brand rose by 5 cents, Yuanrong fell by several cents, Straight Gong Ni fell by a small 3 cents, and Yuchou rose by about half a yuan per piece compared with the previous Huazhu brand Cai Bashi Die Xian Bozi. Only Miaoren Ball fell by 4 corners, and the rest had ups and downs of about 2 corners, but most of them were flat. The price of Ocean Red Cloth was mediocre in the call price.</p>
<p>Wool Fabric Transactions are Only Sporadic</p>
<p>Yesterday, wool fabric transactions were only slight on this street. Clothing shops, after customers specified, still made sporadic embellishments. Although the Chuansha gang has recently moved, it is because the limit price is too harsh, and the attitude of the holders is firm, so very few people actually装办装办. Women's colored woolen cloth is less than men's colored woolen cloth, and actual sales are even more stagnant, so the market has greatly reduced. Although the sales of raincoat cloth are钟钟, but there is a lack of inventory, so the standard is still firm. 4026 is sold at 6 yuan per plate. National Product Zhanghua Dalong Plain Serge, yesterday all increased in price. The Zhanghua 918, which was sold for 1 yuan and 8 and a half corners in the past, is now sold for 1 yuan and 2 corners. The Dalong 128, which was sold for 2 yuan and 8 corners in the past, is now sold for 1 yuan and 9 and a half corners.</p>
<h3>Financial Matters</h3>

The Central Bank's listed prices were revealed, with both British and American currencies remaining stable. Customs gold units increased by two cents. The standard speculative gold price was listed as 1154 yuan. The morning opened with high prices, but there was much profit-taking after the opening, leading to repeated declines. However, due to the Central Bank's occasional offer of cash, demand in the market exceeded supply, eventually leading to a gradual increase and stabilization. The market conditions for today will be recorded below:</p>

Qingfa, Yongshengyuan, and Yongjin reached 2 yuan. Lifeng, Hengchang, and Yong sold again at 2.6 yuan.

Refined gold was priced at 14 yuan above the standard. Tongfengheng sold thirty taels to the Hankou group. The buying price was 11 yuan above the standard.

After the opening, customers continued to settle current East Asian exchange transactions, with the Japanese exchange rate still trading at par. Although HSBC's British and American exchange rates and balance tax were stable, Shanghai slightly settled, but this had little impact due to interbank transactions. Chinese merchants slightly crowded American currency, and then a slight loosening appeared. At noon, the shilling was stable for the near term and loose for the distant term. The American currency was tight for the near term and stable for the distant term. There were many exchange transactions in the afternoon, with banks such as Zhongjiao, HSBC, and Maijia Li all making transactions, as did foreign firms. The closing price was the same as the morning opening, with the British currency stable and the American currency tight by 0.03125 compared to the previous close.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Good Results for January Public Bond Futures</p>
<p>Yesterday was the settlement date for January public bond futures. The total settlement amount was 24,965,000 yuan, of which 19,305,000 yuan was cleared by various brokers and 5,660,000 yuan was cleared through the exchange. This was an increase compared to previous months. On the receiving side, banks and retail arbitrageurs accounted for the majority. The largest delivery volume came from No. 47. The market conditions began on November 26th, when trading opened strongly and the upward trend was strong. Later, due to the deteriorating situation in Suiyuan, major investors started to sell off, leading to a sharp decline. No. 47 and No. 43, on behalf of a certain financial institution, vigorously sold off, creating a weak trend. However, market sentiment remained firm. On December 14th, the Xi'an Incident caused a great disturbance. All unified bonds fell sharply and trading was suspended, with black market prices falling by one or two yuan. Later, with the efforts of the banking community, the market gradually recovered. On the 26th, news of General Chiang's safe return to Luoyang was received, greatly reassuring the public and the market price rebounded sharply, restoring the bond market to normal. After the New Year holiday in 1937, buyers and sellers maintained their positions, causing market fluctuations. Although the Xi'an Incident still had lingering effects, it was no longer significant. On the 24th, the last day, due to strong market sentiment, the demand for deliveries was strong, leading to a severe short squeeze. With the exception of Class A bonds, all bonds reached new highs. The high-low difference during the process was about seven or eight yuan. For future public debt repayments, due to the upcoming Spring Festival holiday and the high market price, there may be a period of fluctuation. The total transaction volume was 24,082,500 yuan. The settlement and composition figures are listed in the table below (unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods</h3>
<p>Xiamen Tangerine Peel Drops Another Five Cents</p>
<p>Since the new crop of Xiamen tangerine peel came out, the amount of goods arriving has been small, but demand has been very weak. Only scattered transactions have occurred in the northern route, so the trend has been difficult to revive. Yesterday, it was heard that the dealers were starting to sell off some goods, which were still red, bright, soft, and glutinous, at a price five cents lower than before. It is unlikely that the market price will change again before the large-scale settlement.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Few Silk Sales in This City</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market saw another decline. The Japanese, American, and Lyon markets were all unusually weak. The New York Japanese silk 83 points and 75 points each fell by three points, Guangdong silk fell by two points, Shanghai silk fell by three points, the Shanghai Standard Silk Exchange's forward and near-term markets each fell by two points, the Hengshi spot price fell by five yuan, the futures price fell by three yuan, the Lyon Japanese silk fell by one and a half francs, Shanghai silk AB grades each fell by one franc, and Guangdong silk remained unchanged. The Luxi silk market was still quite quiet. Manufacturers held prices at 850 yuan for 13.15 strips of RR and 820 yuan for 20.22 direct reeling, and 840 yuan for re-reeling, but few sales opened. These prices were about 40 yuan higher than the external market. For example, white factory 78% direct reeling silk was sold for 780 yuan, down 3 yuan from last week. Users sold at 765 yuan. Yesterday, a total of four packages of domestic and foreign silk were sold.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>English Steel Plates After the Qingdao Group Suspended Business</p>
<p>Since last month, the rapid progress of English steel plates has been surprising. Prices have risen from ten yuan to as high as eighteen yuan. Later, due to the high prices, the Qingdao group suspended sales again, and other groups also reduced orders. However, the small number of goods arriving allowed the standard to hold its ground. According to industry sources, overseas prices are already between thirteen and sixteen pounds.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Tianjin Group's Absorption of Spot Flour Leads to Sudden Price Increase</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the prices for each month initially fell, then rebounded. According to the price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell by four, six, and seven points, Canada fell by seven and eight points, and Liverpool fell by one penny. Therefore, at the opening, sentiment for each month was depressed. The current month fell as low as 8.88 yuan, and April also fell by one or two points. However, after that, market sentiment rebounded, because the bulls did not sell off and the Tianjin group had some spot business, so buying interest was stronger. The near-term rose by two or three points, and the distant-term remained stable. When the afternoon market opened, the current month was boosted by customer demand, and March and April were boosted by dealers covering short positions, so market sentiment was quite good. However, with the settlement date approaching, trading was limited. This kind of abnormal development may not last long.</p>
<p>Highest, Lowest, Yesterday's Closing Price Compared: February 3.9375, 3.8800, 3.9375, up 0.0003; March 3.9975, 3.9600, 3.9975, up 0.0005; April 4.0175, 3.9900, 4.075, up 0.0075.</p>
<p>Old Wheat Prices Rise After Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market showed an initial flat, then rising trend in the morning. When prices opened, they were flat, similar to the previous day, because the price of foreign wheat fell by six, seven, and eight points, and one penny. However, at the second session, because the flour market rebounded and the Japanese month was settled, it was heard that more than 100 cars of wheat were received, half of which were received by Tianjin factories and half of which were said to be sold to local factories. Because the cost of transporting southern wheat to the north was quite high, and after arriving at the destination, it cost an additional 0.3 yuan per yuan to transport it to the receiving factory, which was not cost-effective. However, the large number of settlements did not strengthen market sentiment, so it remained stable and then rose. When the afternoon market opened, the old wheat market remained stable, and the June prices remained flat. As a result, the near-term rose by seven cents to one dime, and the new wheat rose by one cent. As for the spot wheat market, because factories did not want it and the spot wheat price was displayed as standard, most of it was sold on the exchange. Only scattered transactions were made in the market.</p>
<p>Highest, Lowest, Yesterday's Closing Price Compared: February 6.40, 6.32, 6.43, up 0.09; April 6.58, 6.47, 6.57, up 0.10; June 6.59, 6.50, 6.58, up 0.07; June 5.30, 5.27, 5.30, up 0.01.</p>
<p>River Rice Market Continues to Show Improvement</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 shipments from various groups, totaling more than 9,000 piculs. Thin rice accounted for nearly 20 shipments. Sales on this street were still active. The Qingdao, Yantai, and other groups also handled 3,400-3,500 packages of thin rice, so the market continued to improve. The price of thin rice increased by 10 cents, and the price of thick japonica increased by 15 cents. The Du Yang pointed rice was tight and fluctuated. The price of Yin Bian Yuan remained flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about 30 ships arrived from various ports along the river. Sales of various types of rice in the market were average. The price of white japonica rice increased by a few cents to one dime, early rice closely followed, up seven or eight cents, thin rice was expensive, up three to five cents, the price of white yuan rice increased by about 10 cents, and the price of Yang Du pointed rice was tight by a few cents. The Rong tip also showed a tight trend. The prices of all other goods were stable.</p>

<p>Guest Xian Rice Stores Arrive in Large Quantities</p>
<p>Yesterday, the shipments of Guest Xian rice continued to arrive from various ports along the Yangtze River, but sales in Guangdong remained sluggish. Yesterday, only about 1,000 packages were sold. Other groups such as Fuzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen had new inquiries. This street also made some embellishments, but all were only small amounts of socializing and general wholesale shipments. Stores arrived in large quantities, and most of the cargo owners were eager to sell. Therefore, while the River Rice market was rising, the price of Guest Rice instead slightly decreased by three to five cents. The total transaction volume for the day was less than 10,000 packages, including 6,840 packages of Jiangxi rice, 1,116 packages of Han rough rice, 200 packages of Hunan rice, and 1,230 packages of Han Yong rice.</p>

The City Party Headquarters and the Local Association, in conjunction with various groups, are holding this public memorial. Although the ceremony is simple, its significance is profound.

The national crisis is becoming more severe every day. All of us Chinese people should inherit the spirit of our martyrs and strive for our future survival." Du's speech briefly stated, "I think everyone can still remember the situation during the January 28th Incident.

<h3>Philippine President Quezon Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Vice President Kong, Mayor Wu, and others host tea party to welcome him, will return to the Philippines via Shanghai on original ship after trip to the US this morning</p>
<p>Philippine President Quezon and five others are detained. Details of each case are noted below. Traveling to the United States on official business, they took the Canadian Empress, a ship of the Changxing Shipping Company, and arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM yesterday. The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Many Chinese and American figures arrived to welcome them. Vice President Kong, Mayor Wu, and US Ambassador Wang Zhengting held grand welcoming events yesterday. Quezon will take the original ship to the United States this morning. He will visit again briefly when he passes through the port on his way back to the Philippines.</p>
<p>Warm Welcome Those who arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf to welcome Quezon yesterday included Tang Liangli, representing Chairman Wang of the Political Council; Chen Bingzhang, representing Vice President Kong of the Executive Yuan; Liu Yunfang, representing US Ambassador Wang Zhengting; Mayor Wu Tiecheng; Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu; Zhou Jue and Zhao Tiezhang, Director and Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Ministry's Shanghai Office; Jianghai Customs Superintendent Zhu Changnian; Central Committee Member Liu Jiwen; Legislative Yuan Member Lin Bosheng; Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Member Xie Zhongfu; Xu Jianping, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Finance Ministry; US Consul General Gosh; US military representative Peng; and representatives of the Philippine community.</p>
<p>Disembarkation After the ship docked, the welcoming staff boarded to extend their greetings. Quezon shook hands and thanked them one by one, then disembarked and boarded the specially prepared Chinese ship Jinghui, which was moored near the large ship. The ship sailed to Wharf No. 5 in the South City to disembark. The City Security Office sent two squads of honor guards and a military band from the City Police Department to welcome him at the wharf. The area around Wharf No. 5 in the South City was heavily guarded, and vehicles and pedestrians were prohibited from passing through. After Quezon passed, the area returned to normal. Quezon then rode in a car with Mayor Wu and Commander Yang to a specially prepared reception area to rest.</p>
<p>Quezon's Speech Quezon told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday that he planned to arrive in Washington on February 18. After arriving in the United States, he would successively meet with US President Roosevelt and the ministers of the US Department of State and the Department of Defense to discuss national defense plans and economic cooperation. Filipinos now express dissatisfaction with the current US-Philippine tariff and economic situation and hope to improve it. Quezon continued, "In addition to this task, the purpose and timing of the upcoming US-Philippine business and economic conference will be explored." Quezon also admitted that Mr. McShu, who traveled with him, was a private consultant for this trip. The task of Philippine Justice Minister Yu Li is to guide constitutional reform. The specific methods have not yet been determined. After Yu completes his mission in the United States, he plans to go to England to attend the coronation ceremony of the British King. Quezon must also continue to participate. Quezon denied external rumors that his departure from the Philippines was because he did not want to attend the Catholic Eucharist Congress held in Manila on February 3. He said that he was a Catholic and that his wife would represent him in hosting representatives attending the congress. Quezon expressed his deep gratitude to all circles in China for their warm welcome.</p>
<p>Quezon wore a gray tweed casual suit with a black gabardine overcoat, and he was full of energy. He met with the New Voice News Agency reporter at the Cathay Hotel and said that he would have talks with Washington officials about US-Philippine trade and other matters during this visit to the United States and would return to the Philippines in about two or three months. His last visit to Guangzhou gave him an excellent impression. He deeply felt that your country has been completely renewed and is full of vitality. He especially admired President Chiang's advocacy of the New Life Movement and the preservation of inherent dignity. China and the Philippines are close neighbors, and he should devote himself to promoting the friendship between the two countries and increasing it day by day.</p>
<p>Banquets Quezon, accompanied by Justice Minister Yu Li and former US Chief of Staff McShu, went to Mayor Wu's private residence in Haig Road at 4:30 PM yesterday to attend a joint tea party hosted by Vice President Kong and Mayor Wu. Kong apologized for staying in Nanjing for official business and invited various Chinese and foreign figures to accompany him. The party adjourned at 6:00 PM. Quezon then went to Anhe Temple Road to attend the tea party of the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gosh. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting hosted a banquet at the International Hotel at 8:30 PM yesterday, and invited Mayor Wu and Minister to Mexico Tan Shaohua to accompany him. The party ended with great joy at about 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Departure from Shanghai This Morning Quezon had been to Shanghai twice before, and this was his third visit, but it was his first visit to Shanghai after taking office as President. Quezon was eager to go to the United States and did not intend to stay in Shanghai for long. He returned to the original ship at 11:00 PM that night and was scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States at 9:00 AM this morning. As for the group of Philippine journalists such as Luo Moluo, who were on the same ship to Shanghai and the United States, they were a visiting group and were not accompanied by Quezon. They happened to be traveling together.</p>

<h3>Finalizing 1936 Fiscal Year Accounts Across Industries</h3>
<p>Money Shops Have Already Issued Lists to Clients; Banks Provide Loans to Help Industries Repay Money Shops</p>
<p>February 10th is the deadline for Shanghai's industries to finalize their accounts for the 1936 fiscal year. In addition to scheduling a members' meeting on the 2nd to report on the decision of member money shops to increase capital and the discount rate for January, the Money Trade Association has also decided to extend the hours for accepting and returning checks from the 6th and to discontinue interest on deposits but continue charging interest on overdue payments from the 8th. As the deadline for finalizing accounts approaches, internal office hours have been extended to handle the busy collection and settlement process. The money market remains stable, with the daily published overnight interbank rate consistently at 0.8%, a rate that will continue until February 9th. Member banks of the Bankers Association have already finalized their accounts at the end of the Gregorian calendar year, so they will not be finalizing accounts again during the industrial account finalization period. However, due to the busy collection and settlement process, they will extend their hours as they do annually, depending on the specific business of each bank. Money shops have already issued lists to their respective clients, as usual, requesting that outstanding debts be fully repaid by New Year's Eve. Since the bank account finalization period has passed, banks are processing new loan applications to allow businesses to borrow from banks and repay long-standing debts to money shops. The Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank will continue their past practice of supporting various industries by providing as many loans as possible.</p>

The meeting was chaired by Cai Chengxin, with Gu Chengan serving as the recorder. The chairman first reported on the Ministry of Finance's approval of a 1% reward for banks and money shops for withholding deposit interest and passing it on to depositors. Then, the research commenced and continued until 7:30 PM. A reporter from the Xin Sheng She learned that the joint meeting focused on various withholding issues related to income tax, such as: (1) whether net profits used to offset losses should be exempt from taxation; (2) what the tax-exempt boundaries should be for non-profit legal entities; (3) how lump-sum deposits and installment payments should be taxed; and (4) how overseas branches, such as those in Hong Kong, should be taxed. It was decided that the subcommittee would report its research findings to the associations, which would then be submitted to the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance for review and approval.</p>

<h3>Various Organizations in This City to Hold Joint Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Discussing Measures to Deal with Water Rate Increase; Citizens' Association Sends Letter to Company Requesting Cancellation of Agreed-Upon Rate</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Waterworks Company of the International Settlement announced a rate increase, all sectors have expressed their opposition. The First Special District Citizens' United Association of this city has invited various organizations, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Taxpayers' Association, Real Estate Association, General Labor Union, Municipal Farmers' Association, Education Association, and Women's Association, to hold a joint meeting at 2:00 PM on the 30th to discuss countermeasures. The Municipal United Association also sent a letter to the company yesterday morning, requesting the cancellation of the agreed-upon rate increase to ensure the stability of people's livelihoods. The original letter is transcribed below: "This city suffered losses in the January 28th Incident, and its vitality has not yet recovered. Industry and commerce are declining, and the market is depressed. The economic situation of the citizens has plummeted. Although the inland areas have reported a bumper harvest this year, the shocks of the international political situation make it difficult to expect industry and commerce to recover and the market to prosper. Unexpectedly, at this difficult time, your company suddenly proposes to increase rates, further burdening users. It is deeply shocking. Tap water is a public utility, and profits should not be excessive. In recent years, the company's business has been quite good. The sudden rate increase will harm the market and violate the company's mission to serve society. If this matter is insisted upon, your company can, of course, use the cessation of water supply as a means to implement the rate increase, but is the livelihood of the masses and social order not worth considering? This association cannot bear to cause disputes, so it sends this letter, urging you to consider the difficult times, promptly cancel the agreed-upon rate increase, conform to the situation, and stabilize people's livelihoods. We eagerly await your response."</p>
<h3>Capital Increase of Three Banks to Be Decided Soon</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Agrees to Allocate 10 Million Yuan in Government Bonds</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The China Commercial Bank, the China Industrial Bank, and the Ningpo Commercial &amp; Savings Bank underwent rectification some time ago during the financial turmoil to stabilize their operations. Now, for the sake of business development, they have each convened extraordinary shareholders' meetings to discuss increasing capital. Although all meetings were adjourned due to insufficient attendance, the capital increase proposals were approved as provisional resolutions when they were discussed. A second meeting will be convened in early and mid-February to formally pass the resolutions for implementation. The three banks have solicited additional subscriptions from existing shareholders, but the amount is small. Therefore, they requested the Ministry of Finance to allocate government shares, and the Ministry has agreed to allocate 10 million yuan in government bonds for this purpose. The amount to be allocated has not yet been decided. The ratio of converting old shares into new shares is also under negotiation. According to a reporter's investigation, the discount is only about 10%, so some shareholders are dissatisfied and hope that the difficulties of old shareholders will be considered and the discount will be appropriately increased.</p>

<h3>Advantages of the Revised Draft of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law</h3>
<p>China National Products Sales Association, etc., Yesterday Petitioned the Government to Promulgate It Soon</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, in view of the dispersed and unsystematic organization of industrial and commercial sectors nationwide, which resulted in a lack of internal and external strength, decided to actively rectify the situation by revising the old Industrial and Commercial Associations Law.</p>
<p>To divide industries, commerce, and exports separately and establish associations. The Chamber of Commerce Law will also be revised. The full text of the draft of each industry association law has been published by various newspapers. It is now reported that the draft has been submitted by the Ministry of Industry to the Central Political Council for review and has not yet been forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for discussion. Industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai are extremely excited about the Ministry of Industry's active reforms and efforts to strengthen the organization of associations. It is learned that the China National Products Sales Association, the China General Federation of Industry, the Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Federation, etc., in this city have repeatedly held meetings to discuss the new draft of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law, believing that it is extremely suitable for the current needs of society. Yesterday, these associations expressed their support to the Central Political Council, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry,</p>
<p>Unanimously supporting it, requesting that it be promulgated soon. The opinions expressed by the associations are extracted below: "The promulgation of laws and regulations by the state is often due to the results of social evolution and the different trends of the times, and there are changes from time to time. Although the national conditions of various countries in the world are not the same, and their political systems are not entirely the same, the implementation of laws and regulations must be suitable for their own national conditions and the current needs of society, which is an undeniable principle. Since the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law of our country was promulgated in August of the 18th year of the Republic of China, it has been revised twice in August of the 19th year and September of the 21st year. In practice, due to the legislative spirit of adopting liberalism, the association itself lacks the real power to govern the industry, resulting in self-aggression and mutual growth and decline among various industries. The erosion of the entire economic power of the country is difficult to calculate. In recent years, based on the pain experience of industrial and commercial sectors themselves, it is deeply felt that thorough reforms can no longer be delayed. Recently, reading the draft of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law formulated by the Ministry of Industry, it is felt that its legislative spirit has changed to management policy, and it strives to strengthen the powers and functions of the association itself. It is the best regulation to suit the needs of society and follow the trend of the times. We, from the standpoint of industry and commerce, are deeply grateful for the Ministry of Industry's decisive and courageous decision and vow to support it wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Promote its realization. The advantages of the new draft law are briefly listed on the left: (1) Industries, commerce, and export sectors are organized separately. In the future, the implementation of laws and regulations will be more practical and convenient. This is one of the advantages of the new draft law. (2) Stipulating the tasks of each industry association. The old Industrial and Commercial Associations Law only stipulated the purpose of establishing an association and did not have specific tasks, so each industry association had little active action other than routine meetings. This is also a reason why it failed to arouse the interest of the industry to participate. The new draft law has separately stipulated the work of the association, such as the inspection and control of raw materials and products, the control of business operations, and the common equipment in business, so that the tasks of the association have suddenly increased and become heavy, and joining the association can enjoy common benefits, which is enough to correct the disadvantages of the past. This is the second advantage of the new draft law. (3) The voting rights of members of the Industrial Associations are calculated according to the unit amount of membership dues paid. The old Industrial and Commercial Associations Law took the number of attendees as the calculation standard for meeting voting rights, and at the same time stipulated that the number of representatives sent by each manufacturer should not exceed two. The new draft law increases the maximum limit for the number of representatives of commercial and transportation associations to seven, while the voting rights of industrial associations are proportional to the amount of membership dues paid. This is very suitable for the current industrial and commercial situation. This is the third advantage of the new draft law. (4) Designating the classification names in each industry. The old law did not specify the classification of industries and commerce, so there were often the same industry that established several associations to confront each other, and disputes arose frequently, and the主管government departments could not restrict it. The new draft law designates the species of important industries by the department, based on factual needs, to avoid the disadvantages of stacking beds and building houses. This is the fourth advantage of the new draft law. (5) Clearly defining the methods of handling violations. The old law did not have sanctions for members who violated the regulations, so there was no binding force, which was the biggest flaw. The new law stipulates penalties, fines, and suspension of business for those who do not join the association in accordance with the law or violate the regulations and resolutions. It is the primary matter for consolidating the association organization and increasing the power of the association. This is the fifth advantage of the new draft law. The newly revised draft law of the Trade Association has these five major advantages, which are enough to adapt to the times and put industries and commerce on the right track of development. We hope that people from all walks of life will pay attention to studying and expressing sympathy, and if there are any opinions on the content and provisions, they should also contribute sincerely, and it is fortunate to be promulgated soon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rice Transported to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Approximately 40,000 Bags Per Day; Wuhu Rice to Begin Shipping Soon</p>
<p>The Central Government has repeatedly received reports from the Guangdong provincial authorities that the province is experiencing a shortage of food and panic, requesting relief. The relevant authorities have been instructed to transport rice from various rice-producing areas to provide assistance and have approved the temporary accounting of half of the import tax on foreign rice to provide relief. This city is the transportation hub where grain merchants from all over the country gather. Recently, officials and merchants have been actively preparing to provide relief to the food shortage panic in Guangdong Province. The following is a report by a Central News Agency reporter on the situation:</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Ke Xian Rice Shipped to Guangdong Daily: According to news from grain merchants, since Guangdong Province levied an import tax on foreign rice, the amount of foreign rice shipped to Guangdong has become increasingly scarce, and the province's needs cannot be met. Therefore, rice from various provinces is being transported to the market. Due to the convenience of transportation in this city, rice merchants from all over the country have come to sell rice. In addition, the autumn harvest last year was very abundant, and the goods arriving were very crowded. Guangdong Province originally regarded Ke Xian rice as the main product for sale, so recently about 40,000 bags of Ke Xian rice are transported from Shanghai to Guangdong Province every day.</p>
<p>Wuhu Rice Transport to Guangdong to Begin Soon: The Central Government has ordered the Central Trust Bureau and the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau to find ways to provide assistance as soon as possible for the Guangdong Province's food shortage panic. The Central Trust Bureau has sent personnel to Wuhu and Changsha to purchase rice. The Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau is also negotiating transportation issues with transportation agencies. Now, Xiang rice is decided to be transported by land. The Yuehan Road authorities have prepared special cars for transportation. Wuhu's rice is transported by water. However, as the end of the lunar year is approaching, the passenger and freight transportation of various shipping companies is extremely busy. It was originally intended to designate a special rice transporter by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but in order to solve the actual difficulties, it will be cooperated by various shipping companies. It will probably start transporting within days.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Discusses the Guarantee System</h3>
<p>Sends Letters to Industry Colleagues Everywhere for Study; Plans Will Be Decided After Collection</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency: Recently, various newspapers have reported that the Bankers Association announced the abolition of the current guarantee system and suggested a special cash guarantee. Therefore, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Association, to inquire about the details of the matter. According to Mr. Lin, the current guarantor system in the business community has been a long-standing custom. In the past, in the era of credit, both sides were able to strictly abide by the rules. In modern times, personnel are complex, and incidents of fraud and embezzlement are heard every day. If there is a good system, it is urgent to remedy it, and no one will fail to agree. That is, the Association has also gathered to discuss this in the past. Recently, Wang Weiyin said that he has been engaged in research and reform on this issue, exploring the root cause, and drafted an opinion. The method is to replace credit guarantees with cash guarantees. In principle, the theory is appropriate and there is value in discussion. The Association believes that this matter is more deeply related to banks, so it took Mr. Wang's opinion and studied it first. However, one thing is done, and it is always in the interest of implementation. Moreover, it involves reforming social habits, and it is even more valuable to gather ideas and benefit from wisdom. This is why the Association, not only solicits the opinions of colleagues throughout the city, but also sends letters to bank associations everywhere for the same study, which is very serious. After each party replies, the case will be carefully deliberated. Once a complete plan is decided, many adopters will definitely benefit from the effect of success. As for the pieces disclosed in the newspaper recently, they are not released by the Association. During the research period, it can only be used as a reference for people from all walks of life.</p>

<h3>Comrades of the Xinhai Revolution Merchant Corps Plan to Solicit Deeds of Martyrs</h3>
<p>For the sake of commemorating the revolutionary deeds of the past, the Shanghai Merchant Corps comrades of the Xinhai Revolution decided to visit the old comrades in Shanghai to hold registration. It has been scheduled to hold a dinner party at the Hushi on February　day to discuss the method of soliciting the deeds of the martyrs, and decided㊀ to list items from Kang Yuan Canning Factory, Guangdong Road,㊁ Liu Changkang of Shentai Woodware Store, Beijing Road, and㊂ Ding Guanlan of Yansheng Industrial Co., Ltd., Dajilu Yongqingli as three registration offices. The association's origin is recorded as follows: "At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the advanced people at sea saw that foreign aggression was increasing day by day and the national situation was deteriorating. Therefore, the National Merchant Corps Federation was established, and then the Shanghai Commercial and Academic Tutoring Association, the Shanghai Society, the Business and Commerce Association, and other five organizations were established. Talents gathered and the scale was magnificent. Following the establishment of the Shanghai Merchant Corps Basic Team by the Merchant Corps Association, various industries organized district teams, gathering thousands of comrades. Many of the people in charge were devoted to the revolution. The pioneer Chen Gong, a martyr, attacked the Manufacturing Bureau in the battle, and Shanghai was recovered in one battle. Our comrades bravely led the way, and many of them died in battle. Their loyal souls will shine for thousands of years. Since Hong Xian usurped the country, the Merchant Corps was forced to disband. Because of repeated attempts to restore it, it has not been successful. To this day, there are not many people in the county who can talk about the situation at that time. Occasionally, I checked the Shanghai Nanhui Zhuxian Chronicle, and there was no mention of the merchant corps' achievements during the recovery, which is very regrettable. Our comrades were personally led by the advanced people and shared the robes with the martyrs for a long time. All the happy words and virtues are more knowledgeable. On its great deeds, it is especially moved, and it is unbearable to make it submerged. It is our duty to honor virtue and reward merit. Remembering the past, there is understanding and sympathy. The government is now engaged in investigating the deeds of the martyrs, and it is appropriate to make contributions at this time. As for how to collect and compile, how to supplement historical records, how to apply for praise, and how to establish a memorial, we must gather ideas and work together to proceed, so that we can comfort the heroic spirits in the underground and show the example to the future."</p>
<h3>Second Special Municipal United Association's Illegal Interruption of Water and Electricity by the French Authorities</h3>
<p>Submit to the National Government to Order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Make Serious Representations</p>
<p>National News Agency: The Second Special District Citizens' United Association of this city submitted to the National Government yesterday: "Check this time, when the French Concession Municipal Authorities promoted the new donation of Chinese medicine industry, they even cut off water and electricity, blocked the door, and forced to recognize the bad donations and taxes, which is an unprecedented bad example. As for whether the donation and tax should be held, and whether it exceeds the affordability of the citizens, the seriousness of the problem is secondary. The most alarming and painful thing is the method adopted by the authorities to promote the new tax, which is to cut off water and electricity and block the door as a shortcut to force the citizens to recognize the new tax. Once this bad example is opened, then in the future, the municipal authorities intend to hold any new tax, can not ask whether the amount of donation and tax exceeds the ability of the citizens to bear, assuming that the citizens have a little delay or hesitation, or have a legitimate protest, they will have the same danger of being cut off from water and electricity. The degree of autocracy and tyranny is beyond addition. This harsh government has been repeatedly opposed by all the citizens of the French Concession. The crowd is angry and the public is in an uproar. For the sake of the vital interests of the citizens, this association, in view of the deep and great suffering suffered by the Chinese medicine industry this time, although the matter itself has come to an end, but looking forward to the future, it has to make the following suggestions: ㊀ The French Commercial Water and Electricity Company of this city should maintain its commercial independence as a principle. If the citizens pay fees in accordance with the regulations, the authorities shall not use political pressure to force the company to use the supply of water and electricity to promote new taxes. ㊁ Blocking doors or cutting off water and electricity must be executed through court procedures. The municipal authorities shall not enforce administrative orders. ㊂ During the period when the new tax is being promoted and has not yet been implemented, if the citizens are unable to afford it, or because they have not understood the content of the new tax, they have a little doubt, hesitation, or delay in payment, the authorities should adopt peaceful methods to persuade and explain, and shall not use high-pressure methods, such as (cutting off the supply of water and electricity and blocking the door), moreover, the promotion of new taxes and the outstanding old donations have different natures. ㊃ If similar means are used to deal with the citizens in the future, the French Public Works Bureau shall compensate for the corresponding losses. The reasons are listed below: Cutting off water and electricity is not in line with human feelings and legal principles. Water and electricity are necessary for daily life. Cutting off water and electricity is tantamount to starving people. In other words, it is tantamount to killing people. The water and electricity contract is directly signed by the French Commercial Water and Electricity Company and the citizens. There is no express provision in this unreasonable method of cutting off water and electricity. How can a third party interfere and force the suspension of supply, and threaten to cut off water and electricity to the detriment of civilization? It has reached the extreme. Moreover, the municipal authorities of various countries in the world formulate regulations with the interests of the citizens as the most important, so their powers are strictly limited. Cutting off water and electricity has exceeded the authority of the court. The spirit of legislation should be to help the weak, and this method has always been painfully opposed by the citizens of Shanghai. Now it is becoming more and more intense, and it is even further blocked with iron wire, which is a means of collecting donations. The unheard-of violent act since the opening of the Concession is even more criticized by the rule of law. Moreover, it is clearly different to not pay because of not recognizing the new donation and delaying the anti-donation. Why should it be considered a violation of the regulations? If you do not pay any donation, you can only use legal procedures to sue the court. The regulations of the Public Works Bureau cannot replace the law after all. The jurisdiction of the court is still limited, so there are distinctions between judicial power, the right of appeal, and the right of execution. However, the French Public Works Bureau treats those who oppose the increase of donations as criminals, who can be cut off from water and electricity at will, and can arbitrarily sell citizens' business premises and residences. Cutting off water and electricity is tantamount to starving people, and sealing the door is to obstruct freedom. If unfortunately encountered a fire, wouldn't it be that the residents would perish together? It is too much to do things backwards. The power of the French Public Works Bureau is greater than that of the courts of various countries, which is not a joke. No wonder the public has risen up to attack it. What is not seen in the savage countries can be seen in the French Concession of Shanghai. Disregarding public opinion, disregarding humanity, and also greatly violating the morals of various religions, therefore, the item of stopping water and electricity supply stipulated in the Public Works Bureau's regulations must be deleted. It should be requested that His Excellency instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make serious representations to the French Ambassador quickly to protect the people's lives. At the same time, he requested the French Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association to translate the above-mentioned reasons into French and send them to the French Ambassador, the French Consul, the French Commercial Water and Electricity Company, and all the directors of the French Public Works Bureau. He also requested the Public Works Bureau to submit a reconsideration at the next board meeting to cancel the terms of stopping the supply of water and electricity. In addition to seriously questioning each Chinese director and seeking relief measures, he also sent a letter to the French Commercial Water and Electricity Company to stop the violation of the contract and warned that citizens who do not owe water and electricity fees cannot stop the supply of water and electricity, otherwise, they will be liable for all losses.</p>

<h3>Road Workers Mutual Aid Society Sends Letter to the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>Requesting Withdrawal of Dismissal Order</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Public Concession Road Workers Mutual Aid Society sent a letter yesterday to the Public Works Department, requesting that it order the withdrawal of the dismissal of road workers to maintain the people's livelihood. The original letter stated: "To the esteemed Public Works Department, at this time of economic downturn and financial contraction, everyone sympathizes with the need to economize and reduce spending. However, municipal construction and public safety cannot be allowed to regress. The Public Works Department has issued a notice implementing personnel reductions, dismissing over one thousand two hundred of our road workers. Although a hundred or so have been re-hired, this means that nine-tenths have been dismissed. How can anyone willingly accept such harsh measures? Therefore, on the afternoon of the 27th of this month at 7:00 PM, a meeting of representatives of all road workers was convened, and the Mutual Aid Society was organized. It was resolved to list seven reasons, respectfully requesting your consideration: ㊀ Personnel reductions should target high-level officials with monthly salaries of thousands or hundreds of yuan. ㊁ The cause of the social economic downturn is the increase in unemployment. ㊂ Recently, road length has increased, road surfaces have widened, and workload has increased. ㊃ The number of vehicles has increased daily, road surfaces are easily damaged, and repairs are more frequent. ㊄ Original workers braved wind and rain, gunfire during the January 28th Incident, constructed defense works, and survived. Their contributions are not insignificant. ㊅ Wages in various industries have increased recently, but our road workers have not requested wage increases. ㊆ Temporary hiring is prone to corruption and difficult to assemble quickly. Based on the above seven reasons, in terms of human sentiment, legal principles, and factual circumstances, not only should there be no dismissals, but there is a need to hire more road workers. We specifically request that your esteemed Bureau, regarding personnel reductions, should start with upper-level officials, and should show consideration for the road workers who depend on their livelihoods, and instruct the Public Works Department to withdraw the dismissal order to ensure livelihoods and prevent disputes. This is our sincere hope. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>

<h3>Travel Agency Organizes Yandang Mountain Spring Tour Group</h3>

<h3>Special Cash Guarantee Measures (Continued)</h3>
<p>Full Text Released by the Bankers Association</p>
<p>Article 7: Employees should pay a Class B guarantee deposit of 2% of their salary on a daily basis, which will be deducted from their monthly salary.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Since employees have no guarantors, and part of the Class A guarantee deposit and interest must be returned, the Class B guarantee deposit stipulated in this article is essentially a premium for credit insurance. All employees have an obligation to pay it. The rate of 2% is also extremely low. If no malpractice occurs in the future, the principal can be returned in full (see Article 18). This guarantee also implies savings. Assuming that the total annual salary is 1.6 million yuan, this guarantee deposit is estimated to yield more than 31,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>The original intention was to stipulate that this guarantee deposit should be collected on a progressive scale according to the employee's salary level. However, in order to achieve uniformity, a proportional system was adopted, stipulating a uniform rate of 2%. Banks that have already implemented employee savings plans can allocate a portion of these savings to this purpose.</p>
<p>Article 8: The Class B guarantee deposit deducted monthly should be listed in detail by the service location, filled out in an employee Class B guarantee deposit list, and submitted to the head office along with the funds. The head office will store it in a special account, and interest will be calculated at an annual rate of 12 per mille, compounded semi-annually, and allocated to the employee guarantee reserve fund.</p>
<p>(Explanation) This article stipulates that the Class B guarantee deposit deducted from each employee should be listed separately for easy calculation and for centralized management, and it is stipulated that it must be submitted to the head office to prevent abuses. The interest rate is also specially increased to 12 per mille to enrich the guarantee reserve fund.</p>
<p>Article 9: The head office should establish separate employee Class B guarantee deposit sub-accounts for each employee's Class B guarantee deposit, compile them once at the end of each year, and issue Class B guarantee deposit notices to each account, without issuing separate passbooks.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The principal or balance of the Class B guarantee deposit is intended to be returned in the future, so separate accounts should be established to facilitate calculation and the issuance of notices at the end of the year. It is difficult to handle the procedures, but it can also remind employees to pay attention to the benefits of the Class B guarantee deposit and achieve the effect of mutual supervision to eliminate malpractice.</p>
<p>Article 10: The bank will allocate several tens of thousands of yuan of Class C guarantee deposit to employees each year. The amount will be determined by the bank and stored in a special account with interest calculated at an annual rate of 12 per mille, compounded semi-annually.</p>
<p>(Explanation) It is inevitable that the bank will suffer losses due to employee malpractice. In the case of this bank, the losses suffered over the years are not small. If there is no sufficient preparation, it is inevitable that we will be impoverished in response, and the bank also has some responsibility for employee malpractice. Therefore, it is stipulated that several tens of thousands of yuan should be allocated each year as a Class C guarantee deposit. This is within the bank's administrative authority, so it is determined by the bank to show cooperation with employees and share weal and woe.</p>
<p>Article 11: The head office should establish an employee guarantee deposit account, and at the end of each year, the following three payments will be credited to this account for storage and used as an employee guarantee reserve fund:</p>
<p>㊀ Half of the interest on the employee Class A guarantee deposit.</p>
<p>㊁ The principal and interest of the employee Class B guarantee deposit.</p>
<p>㊂ The principal and interest of the employee Class C guarantee deposit.</p>
<p>(Explanation) In order to concentrate the guarantee strength, the three guarantee deposits are combined for storage. Assuming that the total annual salary is 1.6 million yuan, it is estimated that more than 110,000 yuan can be obtained annually, which is sufficient to cope with cases of malpractice.</p>
<p>Articles 1 and 2 of this article stipulate that half of the interest on all employees' Class A guarantee deposits and the principal and interest of the Class B guarantee deposits should be used to replenish the guarantee reserve fund. If a case of malpractice occurs, in addition to handling it in accordance with the provisions of Article 12, if it is insufficient, it will be compensated for losses in accordance with the provisions of Article 13. On the surface, it seems that the guarantee deposits of non-malpracticing employees are used to compensate for the losses of malpracticing employees. In fact, this is a "risk sharing". The original intended use is similar to the premium for credit insurance. However, regardless of whether there is malpractice or not, the insurance premium must be paid and will not be returned. This guarantee reserve fund, if there is no malpractice, or if there is a surplus after compensating for malpractice losses, can still be returned, which is even better than the former.</p>
<p>Article 12: When an employee is liable for compensation, in addition to the criminal part, the service location should handle it carefully, without the need to ask for instructions, and must not be lenient. The illegal employee should be immediately sent to the court nearby for handling according to law, and reported to the head office at the same time. The amount of compensation should be paid from the following payments:</p>
<p>1.  The principal and interest of the employee's Class A guarantee deposit.</p>
<p>2.  The principal and interest of the employee's Class B guarantee deposit.</p>
<p>3.  The principal and interest of the employee's savings.</p>
<p>4.  The employee's other benefits due in office.</p>
<p>5.  All of the employee's assets.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The first half of this article stipulates that the service location should severely punish the malpracticing employee according to law. In order to prevent him from escaping, each service location should immediately send the illegal employee to the court nearby for handling according to law without the need to ask for instructions, and must not be lenient. The head office should be notified at the same time. As for the payments sufficient to cover the compensation, there are as many as five types, which can be used to make up for the losses, which are expected to be sufficient.</p>
<p>Article 13: If an employee is liable for compensation and the payments stipulated in the previous article are insufficient to cover the compensation, the shortfall will be compensated from the three types of guarantee reserve funds of all employees stipulated in Article 11 of these rules, calculated proportionally.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Because the collection of Class B guarantee deposits is equivalent to the premium for credit insurance (see the explanation of Article 18), it was originally intended to compensate for the losses of malpractice by the employee himself or other colleagues. If there is a surplus, it will be returned in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of these rules. However, in order to share the burden equally, when using the three types of guarantee reserve funds in Article 11, it is stipulated that they should be allocated proportionally to show fairness. The so-called proportional allocation is illustrated by the following example:</p>
<p>Assuming that the guarantee reserve fund that can be used each year is as follows:</p>
<p>Percentage of Total Kind Amount (Yuan)</p>
<p>Half of Class A Interest 24,000 3/100</p>
<p>Class B Principal and Interest 32,000 29/100</p>
<p>Class C Principal and Interest 56,000 50/100</p>
<p>Total 113,000 100</p>
<p>If a malpractice case occurs with a loss amount equal to 10% of the guarantee reserve fund, then each of the Class A, B, and C reserve funds will contribute 10% to compensate, i.e., 2,400 yuan from Class A, 3,200 yuan from Class B, and 5,600 yuan from Class C, totaling 11,200 yuan. Analyzing the source of this 11,200 yuan, half of it comes from the bank, which can be said to be a manifestation of the bank's determination to promote the new system. The care for the employees is not inconsiderable. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Decides to Open Xiamen-Philippines Route</h3>
<p>Developing Ocean Shipping; Anticipating Expectations; To Be Realized in Mid-Next Month, Temporarily Focusing on Passenger Transport</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation previously stated that our country had no dedicated ships operating on international routes, which were almost entirely controlled by foreign merchants. This caused great inconvenience for the promotion of domestic products and the travel of overseas Chinese. In order to develop shipping, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping agencies were ordered to plan and implement it. After receiving the order, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company repeatedly convened meetings with various shipping agencies in Shanghai. At that time, the consensus was that the planning and capital required to open international routes were beyond the capabilities of our country's shipping merchants, so it was temporarily suspended. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company did not cease planning for this matter. Later, it was heard that the company had decided to independently implement it in phases and had even planned to charter a sea-going ship to start the Xiamen-Philippines route (i.e., from Xiamen directly to and from Manila), but the issue of chartering a ship could not be resolved, and chartering a ship was not very cost-effective, so this proposal was suspended again. Until recently, it was heard again that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had decided to allocate one of the</p>
<p>Four New Sea-Going Ships Built with Boxer Indemnity Funds, the Haiheng, to trial operation between Xiamen and the Philippines, as a preliminary step in developing ocean shipping, anticipating the expectations of all parties and comforting overseas Chinese, but focusing on passenger transport. The above plan has recently been approved by the Ministry of Transportation. The company is currently actively preparing, and it is expected to be realized in mid-next month. The company previously planned to send the Haiyuan to operate on this route, but now it has changed to sending the Haiheng. The two ships are both new and there is no difference, but because of</p>
<p>Dispatching Reasons, one is replacing the other. The Xiamen agency is located at Bingji Shipping Company in Liaozihou, Xiamen. The Philippine agency is Manila Steamship Co., Manila. The ship is approximately 340 to 50 feet long, approximately 47 feet wide, 75 feet high to the upper deck, and approximately 17 feet high to the clear deck, with a displacement of more than 3,200 tons. The engine has 2,500 horsepower, and the speed is 13 nautical miles per hour.</p>
<p>Thirteen Nautical Miles. The special equipment includes automatic water detectors, direction finders, and anti-theft equipment. Other equipment is also of the highest quality and is unmatched by the current Chinese and foreign sea-going ships in Shanghai. The various cabins in the ship are arranged in a new, clean, and suitable manner. The first-class cabins are equipped with electric fans, heaters, air-conditioning cabinets, and bathrooms. The equipment in the second and third-class cabins is roughly the same. The fourth-class cabins are all canvas beds and the space is also extremely</p>
<p>Spacious and clean. The captain of the Haiheng is Ma Jiajun, who is astute, capable, experienced, and has obtained a first-class seaman's certificate. The ship's crew is also highly experienced. Because the new ship's machinery and engines are the latest, the company sent personnel familiar with mechanical affairs to England to practice driving skills and engine management, striving for excellence. All the service personnel (formerly known as tea boys) are also well-trained, so from the perspective of employee service, passengers can feel convenient, comfortable, and satisfied.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Knocks on Door; Robbers Commit Robbery</h3>
<p>You De'an Loses Over a Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>No. 25 Hengqing Lane, Baylor Road, French Concession, is the residence of You De'an from Sichuan, who runs a fur export business. His family is well-off, which led to him being targeted by robbers. Yesterday evening around 8:00 PM, a young woman went to knock on the door. When You ordered the maid to open the door, four robbers suddenly rushed in, displayed handguns, and confined all the men, women, masters, and servants in the house to the back kitchen, assigning one robber to stand guard with a gun. The remaining robbers went upstairs and searched at will. After twenty minutes, they carried away the stolen goods and fled. Afterwards, the victim estimated that he had been robbed of more than 400 yuan in legal tender, two gold watches, a gold bracelet, and four precious fur coats, totaling over 1,000 yuan. He issued a loss report and reported it to the Lujiawan General Patrol Room for investigation.</p>
<h3>Pawnshop Charges High Interest; Four Per Mille Per Month</h3>
<p>Zhitai Pawnshop Accused; Hearing Concluded Yesterday; Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Yu Jingyu, chairman of the Haiqi (Haimen Qidong) Victims' Aid Association, accused the Zhitai Pawnshop at No. 98 Laobaidu Street, Sixteenth Pier, of repeatedly seizing Huang Ajin's two gold rings, Zhang's watch, and one pair of line spring white cloth pants that he borrowed from a friend last summer. He took eight dime silver coins and made more than 27 copper coins in interest in less than three months. The complainant alleged the pawnshop had committed encroachment, charged excessive interest, and engaged in exploitation. Inspection Officer Tang Ruxiu investigated and prosecuted Zheng Banghui, the manager of the pawn shop, and shop assistant Guo Jingming. The hearing was held yesterday by Criminal Judge Li Dingcheng. The defendant Zheng Banghui did not attend, and Guo Jingming hired lawyer Zhu Yazou for defense. Yu Jingyu detailed the previous circumstances, stating that the pawnshop charged an excessive interest of more than 4 per mille per month. He also claimed that the defendant Guo Jingming admitted to the inspection officer that he charged 25 copper coins in interest. According to Article 11 of the Shanghai Pawnshop Business Rules, which were temporarily set at 18 per mille per month for interest on pawned items, 2 per mille for storage rent, and pawned items with a debt of less than 2 yuan that are not accepted by pawnshops may temporarily increase storage rent and handling fees, but not more than 1 per mille per month, and which were revised by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, his pawned capital was originally eight silver dimes, which should be converted to more than 6 dimes 6 cents according to Article 9 of the previous rules. Even if the interest is calculated at 3%, and the period is less than 3 months, the interest should be around 6 cents, but they actually charged 9 cents, which is an obvious exploitation of people's urgency and acquiring of money, and obtaining excessive interest that is not commensurate with the principal. Guo Jingming claimed that he was a shop assistant and denied the facts. The court adjourned the debate and will pronounce the sentence on the afternoon of the 20th.</p>
<h3>Truck Runs Over and Kills Person; Driver Flees; Driver Accused of Murder</h3>
<p>Arrested After Extensive Investigation; Deceased's Family Requests Court to Grant Justice</p>
<p>Xiao Fengying, a 19-year-old woman from Taizhou, lived at No. 127 Haizhou Road and worked at the Dakang Cotton Mill. Around 6:00 AM on the 14th of this month, she was returning home from the factory when she was hit by a truck near Garland Road on Yangshupu Road, suffering fatal injuries. The truck sped away without a trace. Xiao's body was sent to Fielin Road for an autopsy, as reported in this newspaper. Afterwards, the Yangshupu Police Station sent Chinese detectives Zhang Yunjian and Zhang Guanying to investigate. At noon the day before yesterday, they learned that the truck number was 17095, which belonged to the Huafu Company at No. 19-21 Huade Road. The driver was Zhang Zhongyin from Zhenjiang. They secretly went to the address and arrested him, taking him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Public Works Department lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and stated that after the defendant caused the accident, according to what he said at the police station, someone told him that he had hit a person at the intersection of Garland Road and Yangshupu Road and had been taken to the hospital. He went to that place at 7:00 PM that afternoon and saw a pool of blood on the ground, but still did not report to the police station. At the time of the accident, he also felt something falling to the ground and deliberately fled. He is now being prosecuted for murder under Article 276, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Ding Zixiao, a female worker from the same cotton mill, testified that the defendant was driving quite fast at the time and did not honk the horn, which caused the accident. Xiao Zhu, the mother of the deceased, also stated that Fengying was her biological daughter and recently learned of the incident in her hometown. She came to Shanghai overnight to request justice. Zhang Zhongyin's confession was vague. Judge Xiao Xie'fen ordered him to be detained again and the hearing rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Sun Wenming's Bomb Case Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Postponed for Continued Trial Next Month</p>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the "January 28th" Shanghai War. To maintain the peace of the Public Concession, the Police Department of the Public Concession specially instructed all police stations to select detectives for strict patrols at key points to prevent petty criminals from hiding and disrupting public order. At 8:10 PM the day before yesterday, Sun Wenming (21 years old), from Changzhou, was found carrying two hand grenades while passing the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Chengdu Road by Chinese Detective Chief Mao Yiwen, Detective Ma Zhongrong, and Detective Wang Shidong of the Xin Zha Police Station. He was taken to</p>
<p>the police station for detention. All details were published in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Wan Zhishan, filed a lawsuit according to Article 187 of the Criminal Law for possessing explosives with intent to commit a crime, and stated the facts of the case, saying that at 8:10 PM last night, Detective Ma Zhongrong of the Xin Zha Police Station received information that someone was carrying explosives and intended to commit illegal acts at the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Chengdu Road. He went and arrested the defendant and found</p>
<p>two round bombs in his sleeves. They had handles and fuses. According to the defendant's confession at the police station, on the 24th of this month, he carried a bomb with the intention of committing illegal acts. While passing the entrance of Lane 623 on Yongjiang Road, he happened to encounter Chinese police</p>
<p>inspecting pedestrians. In a moment of panic, he threw the bomb into the garbage bin in the lane. The bomb has not been found yet, and the police are still investigating. Last night, the defendant carried two bombs with the intention of robbing the property of Da Xin Nanhuo Store at No. 417 Xin Zha Road, but was unfortunately arrested on the way. Because the police investigation of the defendant was not complete, they requested permission to postpone the trial. The confiscated hand grenades were dangerous items and were not suitable for submission as evidence. After the judge briefly questioned the defendant Sun Wenming, he ordered him to be detained pending a further hearing on February 4th.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestic Exports</h3>

<h3>Conclusion of the Appeal Case of the Assassin of Shao Wenbin</h3>
<p>At 8:00 PM on July 28, 1933, Shao Wenbin, the "King of Flower Shows," also known as Ma Fu A'liu, was assassinated on Rue Wagner in the French Concession due to a feud over flower show territory. At the time, a patrolman chased and shot dead one of the murderers on Avenue Edward VII. Later, the French police arrested Zhang Bingrong, nicknamed "Little Ningbo," as the murderer and sent him to court, where he was sentenced to life imprisonment. On September 2nd of last year, Wang Shilong, the principal offender, and Qian A'jin, the suspect, also known as "Hemp Skin A'jin," were apprehended and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. After the trial, Wang was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment, with 10 years of deprivation of civil rights, and 2 years for opening a flower show gambling den, with a total of 14 years of imprisonment and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights. Qian A'jin was sentenced to imprisonment for being a recidivist in flower show gambling and fined 500 yuan. Wang and Qian did not accept the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After the investigation chamber concluded its investigation, the case was heard yesterday in the Third Criminal Court by Wu Tingqi, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court, along with Judges Chen and Wang, Prosecutor Dong, and Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department. The appellants were defended by lawyers such as Zhu Dianxiang and Wang Xiubo. During the trial, Wang and Qian both denied planning to kill Shao Wenbin or opening a flower show, claiming that they were falsely accused and forced to confess. Zhang Bingrong was also brought to the stand for questioning, but his testimony was also evasive. After reviewing the entire case file, the court believed that the facts were clear, ordered a debate, declared the case closed, and scheduled a sentencing date. The appellants were returned to the detention center, and Zhang Bingrong was sent back to prison to continue serving his sentence.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhushu's Alteration of Documents Reverses Two Characters</h3>
<p>Resulting in Incoherent Text; Defendant Posts 300 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>Zheng Zhushu, the owner of Dalu Nanhuo Store at No. 778 North Chengdu Road, was sued by Ma Deming, a local resident, through his lawyer Wu Luping, in the local court for altering documents. The complaint stated that Sun Runhua, the former owner of Run Kang Nanhuo Store in Minhang Town, purchased goods from the Dalu Nanhuo Store owned by the defendant Zheng Zhushu and asked the plaintiff to be the guarantor. In October 1935, the plaintiff personally wrote a guarantee letter stating, "The amount of goods purchased after October 13th of last year is standardized at hundreds of yuan." It was very clear that the plaintiff was only responsible for guaranteeing 100 yuan. However, in September of last year, when the defendant filed a lawsuit in the court against Sun Runhua to recover the price of the goods and the guaranteed debt, the defendant added an inverted symbol next to the words "shu yi" ("amount with") in the guarantee letter written by the plaintiff, changing it to "yi shu bai yuan wei biao zhun" ("with amount hundreds of yuan as standard"). Not only was the text incoherent, but it was also clearly altered after the fact, involving criminal liability. The Civil Division has already determined the facts and stated them in the reasoning section of the judgment in that case. The defendant's alteration of private documents with the intention of obtaining illegitimate profits and causing the plaintiff to perform an obligation that he had no duty to perform was sufficient to harm others, and his criminal conduct could not be concealed, clearly violating Article 220 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Guo Xiangzu held a hearing, and as a result, the defendant was ordered to post 300 yuan bail for further trial.</p>
<h3>Spring Household Registration for Civilian Villages</h3>
<p>The Municipal Civilian Welfare Enterprise Management Committee, recognizing that the general working class citizens cannot solve their housing problems due to insufficient financial resources, specially allocated huge sums of money last year to build four beautiful civilian villages at Zhongshan Road and Pushan Road, Qimei Road, and Damuqiao, totaling more than 1,000 buildings. The rent for each building is only four or five yuan. The village was originally built to seek welfare for the city's people, so not only is the rent extremely cheap, but also various facilities, such as running water, electricity, public bathrooms, sanitary facilities, auditoriums, various sports fields, gardens, etc., are all available, far beyond what other commercially-run municipal houses can compare with. Each village also has a completely free municipal elementary school and cooperative. Residents can obtain beautiful housing with very little rent, and can also cultivate their children and exercise their bodies. Therefore, it is known as the "Happy Land for Civilians." Currently, the housing in each village has long been rented out. In order to allow the general citizens of this city to have the opportunity to enjoy these benefits, the committee is now opening up more housing and holding a spring household registration. Those who register first will be approved to move in in order. It is expected that many people will go to register at that time.</p>

<h3>Japanese and Gambling Thugs Secretly Set Up Gambling Den; Case Cracked</h3>
<p>Japanese Okumura Hideo Handed Over to Consulate for Interrogation; Other Chinese Sentenced and Fined Separately</p>
<p>It was recently rumored in the Kunshan Garden area of North Sichuan Road in Hongkou that someone was secretly setting up a gambling table there, using people of a certain country as a talisman to attract general gamblers to gamble on pai gow and 26-door hulu, drinking and making noise all night long. The Hongkou Police Station heard about this and specially dispatched Chinese detectives Wang Chonghao, Chen Binzhong, Kong Guangxiao, etc., to undertake secret investigation work, and secretly sent informants to mix in with the gamblers to investigate the truth. After several days, it was discovered that the gambling table was actually jointly opened by Japanese Okumura Hideo and the gambling thug Hu Sanmei. Most of the people gambling inside were Cantonese, and there were also some foreigners. They first bought chips with cash, and then entered the game. The wins and losses were quite large. After the detectives verified the contents, they reported back to the police chief and requested the Japanese consulate and the First Special Court to issue search warrants. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, they went to the gambling den at No. 854 North Sichuan Road and arrested Japanese Okumura Hideo, Feng Si, a Cantonese who was pushing the table, the gamblers Liu Zhi, She Xin, and the woman Lai Li'e, who claimed to be Greek, along with 31 large metal chips, 30 small bone chips, 95 bone chips, a tablecloth, a set of pai gow, five dice, a shaking cylinder, nickel coins, etc. They were all taken to the police station and ordered to hand over the Japanese to the Japanese consulate for interrogation. The woman Lai Li'e was released on 500 yuan bail. The remaining 36 people were detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the facts of the case. After Judge Pan questioned each defendant, Feng Si was sentenced to three months of imprisonment in court. Chen Zhang, Li Songquan, Zeng Jin, and Li Rihong were detained for further trial. The remaining 32 people, including Liu Zhi and Lai Li'e, were each fined 30 yuan, and the gambling equipment was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Female Worker Has Affair with Candy Factory Owner</h3>
<p>Husband Sues for Disruption of Family</p>
<p>Xie A'mao, a 38-year-old from Wuxi, who is currently working at Yixing Pawnshop on Fangbang Bridge, married Zhang A'di (25 years old this year), a woman from his hometown, in the spring of 1933. Because of the poor family situation, Zhang A'di was introduced by Zhu A'mei to work in the Gongda Yarn Factory, and she sent home six or seven yuan of her wages each month to supplement the family expenses. In the second half of 1934, Zhang A'di suddenly stopped sending money home and there was no news of her. Xie came to Shanghai to look for her but could not find her. Until recently, he learned that Zhang A'di had an affair with Huang Meiqing, the owner of Dacheng Candy Factory on Avenue Joffre, who also worked in the insurance industry, and they were living together. Therefore, Xie filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, suing Huang Meiqing for disrupting his family, and also filed a civil suit, requesting the court to order the surrender of Zhang A'di so that he could take her home to resume their marriage. Upon receiving the complaint, the court held a hearing yesterday morning by Judge Yang Songlin. First, the plaintiff described the process of his wife being seduced by the defendant and living together in an affair. When questioned, the defendant Huang Meiqing denied the matter. The court ordered a postponement for further investigation on February 5th. The defendant was released on bail or detained without bail.</p>
<h3>Appeal Trial of the Xuan Sheng Assassination Case Opens</h3>
<p>No Results Yesterday; Continued Hearing Scheduled</p>
<p>Suzhou, January 28th Telegram: In the case of the assassination of Xuan Sheng, a Japanese merchant, on Qimei Road, Dixiwei Road, Zhabei in July of last year, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested eight criminals, including the main culprits Mao Yonghu, Wang Zhensheng, Zhao Yunhong, Jin Daoquan, Zhu Guisheng, and Zhang Ma'shi, at Jiande Apartment and other places. After the Shanghai Local Court concluded the trial, Wang Zhensheng and Mao Yonghu were sentenced to death for jointly committing continuous murder and deprived of their civil rights for life. Zhao Yunhong was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for assisting in murder and deprived of his civil rights for 10 years. Jin Daoquan was sentenced to 13 years of imprisonment for continuously assisting in murder and deprived of his civil rights for 10 years. Zhu Guisheng and Chen Enming were each sentenced to 2 years of imprisonment for preparing to commit murder. After Mao Yonghu and others were sentenced, they all expressed their dissatisfaction and appealed to the Jiangsu Higher Court. The case was transferred to Suzhou the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the Suzhou Higher Court, with Judge Zhou presiding in the Third Criminal Court, first heard Mao Yonghu, who confessed that he was 29 years old and had been selling fruit at the 16th Pier. Li Ruiwu told me that he had a feud with the Japanese and asked me to kill a Japanese. Because I didn't have the courage, I introduced Wang Zhensheng. On July 6th and 7th of last year, we wandered around Qimei Road and Dixiwei Road for two days. Because the gun I was carrying wouldn't fire, I didn't succeed. On July 8th, Wang Zhensheng brought a pistol. When he saw a Japanese on Qimei Road and Dixiwei Road, Wang Zhensheng shot the Japanese. After playing around at the ice cream stand, I took a rickshaw to the Renhe Hotel in the French Concession. Later, Li Ruiwu sent me 200 yuan in banknotes. I used 30 yuan, Wang Zhensheng used 50 yuan, and Zhao Yunhong used 20 yuan, etc. Then Wang Zhensheng was questioned and confessed, "My confession at the Public Security Bureau is not true," etc. Judge Zhou then questioned Mao Yonghu and Wang Zhensheng together. Mao suddenly overturned his previous confession. Zhao Yunhong was then questioned and confessed, voluntarily withdrawing his appeal. Following this, Jin Daoguan, Zhu Guisheng, Chen Enming, and others all claimed that they firmly denied any involvement in the assassination. As a result, Judge Zhou argued that the original judgment did not contain any valid grounds for appeal. He ordered that the grounds for appeal should be submitted in writing while in the detention center, and a continued hearing would be scheduled at a later date.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Expresses Condolences to the Family of the Austrian Consul</h3>
<p>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Arnold, sent a letter to the Austrian Deputy Consul in Shanghai yesterday (January 28th), the translation of which is as follows: "The Bureau was deeply saddened and infuriated to learn of the passing of your country's Consul, Mr. Okme Luo, at his residence yesterday. Please convey to Mrs. Okme and the Austrian community the sincere condolences of my colleagues and myself."</p>
<h3>Confirmation of Paternity Case; Zhang Wubo Cannot Deny Responsibility</h3>
<p>Escorted from Zhenjiang to Shanghai After Being Wanted by the Court; Zhang Still Denies and is Ordered to Post Bail for Further Trial</p>
<p>Zhang Wubo, a native of Zhenjiang, is 47 years old and works as a broker at Yongtai Chang Foreign Goods Store, No. 8, Taihe Lane, Fuzhou Road. In 1926, he met Fang A'ying (now 26 years old), a woman from Ningbo, and soon rented a room in the penthouse of No. 763, Binqing Lane, Tiantong Road, to live together. The following year, a son was born, named Zhimin. When Zhimin was three years old, Zhang suddenly claimed that he intended to go to Japan</p>
<p>to do business.</p>
<p>He paid Fang 300 yuan as living expenses, and from then on, Zhang disappeared and there was no news of him for four years. Later, in July 1933, Fang met Zhang on the road and asked Zhang to take the child back. Zhang refused, promising to give 700 yuan to settle the matter, which was later increased to 1,000 yuan, but Fang did not agree, so they broke up. Fang then sued Zhang for abandonment in court. Because Fang had no legal standing, she lost the case. Fang then</p>
<p>sued to confirm</p>
<p>that Zhimin was Zhang's child, and again failed. She appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, and the court finally ruled that Zhimin was Zhang's child. Zhang also disagreed and appealed to the Supreme Court. The court rejected the appeal and the case became final. Therefore, Zhang should have been legally obligated to raise Zhimin. Unexpectedly, Zhang still did not bear the responsibility and hid himself. Fang A'ying reported this to the General Police Station, which requested the First Special District Court to issue</p>
<p>an arrest warrant.</p>
<p>Until recently, Zhang Xiaolin, a Chinese detective of the police station, and Detective Mao Yunlong learned that Zhang was reported to be smoking opium in his hometown of Zhenjiang and was sent to the provincial drug rehabilitation hospital for investigation by the county government. They immediately carried the official letter and went to Zhenjiang and brought Zhang to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhang hired lawyer Fan Gang for defense. First, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the facts of the case and presented the judgment of the Supreme Court, requesting that he be</p>
<p>punished according to the</p>
<p>crime of abandonment under Articles 294 and 295 of the Criminal Law. Zhang and Fang A'ying were ill due to travel fatigue, so they did not appear in court. When questioned, Zhang Wubo denied having any relationship with Fang A'ying. Chief Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division then asked if he had an opium addiction because the Zhenjiang County Government had requested that he be sent back for investigation after the case was over, but Zhang also denied it. Judge Qian then ruled that the case would be adjourned for one week for further hearing, and Zhang Wubo was allowed to post a shop bail of 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tongyi Creditors Now Have Relief Measures</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng and Others Follow Hangzhou Association's Request</p>
<p>Since Tongyi Trust Company declared its closure, the First Special District Local Court, together with the bankruptcy administrator, accountant Li Ding, and lawyer Li Mian, have held four creditors' meetings, but the number of creditors present at each meeting did not meet the statutory quorum, and the meetings were declared adjourned. Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and others, in view of the fact that the amount of Tongyi's debt was as high as more than four million yuan, which had a considerable impact on Shanghai's financial situation, specially proposed a reorganization plan, and most creditors also agreed that the execution of bankruptcy was not beneficial. Recently, the mediators Du Yuesheng and others received a letter from the Hangzhou Tongyi Company Creditors' Association requesting relief because the creditors were in urgent need of funds at the end of the year and had not been able to meet the statutory quorum of creditors' meetings to pass the reorganization plan. After discussion, Du, Yu, Wang, and other mediators believed that relief was indeed necessary. At that time, the Taiji Silver Company on the fifth floor of the Zhonghui Building on Avenue Edward VII was holding a special year-end loan program, so Du and others consulted with the silver company and obtained permission for the creditors of the Hangzhou Tongyi Company to discount their deposit slips for cash to provide relief. It is also reported that the local creditor group is following up with similar requests.</p>
<h3>Child Beaten to Death by Child in Hongqiao Dabaishan</h3>
<p>How Did Shen Miaosheng Die? Prosecutor Awaits Autopsy</p>
<p>Shen Chen, a woman from Songjiang who lives at No. 11, Hongqiao Dabaishan, sells bean curd for a living. Her eldest daughter, Shen Meiying, is a cosmetics saleswoman. Her son, Shen Miaojin, who is twelve years old this year and studies at Xiaotang, was beaten and injured by three naughty children on the road in front of his house at around 5:00 PM on the 19th of this month.

The report was submitted to the Miaojiao Road Police Station, which dispatched Police Officer Zhu Pu. The entire family of the leather factory fled, and Li A'liu also fled. Zhu Guangzhou and his son Zhu Deyuan, and Li Zhang, were taken into custody. Yesterday, the local officer Qian Shaoxiang was ordered to report the autopsy to the local court. Prosecutor Kong and others were commissioned to conduct the autopsy. It is said that an autopsy is required.</p>

<h3>Broadcasting Association Petitions for Relief for Eight Radio Stations</h3>
<p>Since the eight radio stations, including Zhou Xieji, members of the local private broadcasting station industry association, were instructed by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to cancel their broadcasting rights by the end of this month, the member radio stations have successively petitioned the association to forward their petitions to the Ministry of Communications and the Central Broadcasting Business Guidance Committee, requesting that they be considerate of the difficulties of businesses, withdraw the order, and immediately promulgate the equipment standards for private radio stations so that each station can comply with and improve them. Because the Ministry of Communications has not yet approved the petition, they are petitioning the Executive Yuan for relief. According to the original petition of the association, the reasons for the Ministry of Communications' order to revoke the licenses of each radio station by the end of January are: (1) the licenses have not been renewed for several years after they were issued, (2) the equipment is simple, and (3) the broadcast interferes with other stations. However, according to the regulations for the management of private radio stations, the term of the license is only six months. However, it has been verified that each radio station has completed construction and has been inspected and approved by the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to broadcast, and has paid the license fees in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of the management regulations. However, most of them have not been issued licenses. Therefore, in 1935, each radio station prepared the documents and fees to be paid and submitted them to the association for collection. However, at that time, the Telecommunications Bureau instructed that they had to wait for the Ministry of Communications to issue them and only ordered that the documents be returned. Therefore, the failure to renew the license cannot be regarded as the negligence of the radio stations. As for the equipment problem, there is no clear provision in the regulations for the management of private radio stations. Furthermore, the equipment diagrams of each radio station have been submitted for approval in accordance with Article 1 of the management regulations before they can obtain a license and start construction. Afterwards, they must submit a request for inspection and approval before they can broadcast. Furthermore, they have complied with the orders to add or modify equipment and have submitted a request for re-inspection. However, private radio stations, due to capital relations, cannot be compared with the equipment of state-owned radio stations. The simple equipment is not clearly regulated, so it cannot be regarded as the fault of the radio stations. As for the interference problem, the power of each radio station is not strong, and they have complied with the order to install filters. For example, the Anding Radio Station submitted a request to move due to the demolition of its building last year, but it has not been able to find a suitable location and has not broadcasted yet, so there is no possibility of interference. Moreover, private radio stations are businesses that gather capital from merchants and operate for maintenance. Once they are ordered to be demolished, their livelihoods are at stake. Private radio stations cannot be transferred like other businesses, so the capital spent will be wasted, and it is difficult to know what will happen in the future. Furthermore, Shanghai is the place where the essence of the country gathers and is the place where the country's listening audience gathers. At a time when foreign radio stations are increasing their power and broadcasting, the reason why Shanghai is not affected is that Shanghai's radio stations are scattered around the city. If there is any space, they will definitely take the opportunity to enter, and the central propaganda agencies will be reduced. Therefore, the result of revoking the licenses and stopping broadcasting is that the radio stations that are punished suddenly lose their livelihood, and internationally, it only gives others a good opportunity to broadcast and propagandize. Other radio stations are also in danger and do not know what to do. Therefore, they have petitioned the Ministry of Communications and the Central Broadcasting Business Guidance Committee to allow them to accept the lower-level situation and withdraw the order. However, because of the urgency of the situation, they are specially presenting the facts and requesting the President to review and approve the petition, be considerate of the difficulties of businesses, order the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order immediately, and promulgate the equipment standards that private radio stations can meet so that each station can comply with the order to improve. If they cannot improve, they will be shut down again. Before the equipment standards are issued, they should be temporarily allowed to broadcast as usual to maintain the people's livelihood. As for the sections stated by the Huaguang Radio Station, there is no lease or transfer situation. Please order the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order together, which would be very beneficial, etc. In addition, the association submitted the petition to the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order on the 16th of this month, but it has not been approved yet, and it also sent an urgent telegram to the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, requesting immediate approval.</p>

<h3>Seven-Fingered Man</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>After drinking alcohol, the next day when he got up, he was listless, his eyes were red. While yawning, he would scold the monks who ate meat and drank alcohol, saying they had no morals and would definitely go to hell after death. People who heard him scolding were happy and laughed, and he would immediately feel refreshed and happy to do some work. If there was no one to listen on this day and nowhere to scold, he would yawn until night as if he were having bad luck. This person was Qingru, a monk who didn't usually live in temples but enjoyed traveling, and who only had seven fingers.</p>
<p>I knew him, and had been with him for a long time, in a roadside inn. When I discovered this strange habit of his, I mocked him and said:</p>
<p>"You're practically scolding yourself! Listen to my advice, you might as well quietly and drunkenly drink alcohol and eat meat."</p>
<p>After I pointed it out, he felt a little embarrassed and stammered:</p>
<p>"I don't feel well if I don't scold!"</p>
<p>Immediately, he waved his hand, which was scratching his bald head, with disgust, and his habit of scolding flared up again.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't I be scolded often? I want you to point at my nose and scold me, but you're all like a duck's webbed feet, all in a line, saying one thing but thinking another, or else, flattering to my face and laughing behind my back. It makes me feel stuffy in my stomach, it's really uncomfortable. You have to know that when a person understands that he has done something wrong, but there is no way to correct it, then only a scolding will make him feel better. Don't say that, let me tell you a story from a book of virtue, have you heard of it? It says that a person stole someone else's chicken and ate it, and then grew chicken feathers all over his body, which he couldn't pull out, and if he pulled hard, it would hurt terribly! So what should he do? There was simply no way, and he was so ashamed that he couldn't face anyone. Later, he happened to meet a monk, who was already halfway to becoming a celestial being, definitely not like me, drinking alcohol and eating meat, and even whoring. The monk told him that his stealing of the chicken was ill-fated, he just happened to have met good people, and hadn't been scolded or cursed at, so his sin on this side couldn't be expunged, and he had to carry it all on his body. If he wanted to get the chicken feathers pulled out, it would be best to go to those good people, kowtow, say that he was wrong to steal the chicken, and would never dare to do it again, and beg him to scold him. The chicken thief thanked the monk, and quickly went to do it. Who knew that those good people were really virtuous, and wouldn't scold him no matter what. Later, he begged bitterly, and told him what the monk said, saying that scolding him would be a good deed. Only then did he agree. If you hadn't seen it with your own eyes, you might not believe it, but it was really strange, but before they had scolded him twice, the chicken feathers began to fall off one by one. So, it seems, the most powerful thing in the world is being wronged, but not fighting back, not cursing back."</p>
<p>When he scolded to this point, his cloudy eyes became clear and bright, and there was naturally no shadow of yawning on the corners of his mouth. As for this kind of story, in my opinion, it was just nonsense and not worth refuting. However, in his mind, I understood that this had created his philosophy of life, and had even become the basis for daily expiation of sins. Therefore, I teased him and said:</p>
<p>"Judging from your past scolding, I've long been wondering why you're not afraid of falling into hell? It turns out you're the one who understands this method! Haha."</p>
<p>His face turned red, and he argued disapprovingly:</p>
<p>"Your mouth is really sharp! I have no choice, that's why I'm like this. If I had known it would turn out this way, why would I have become a monk? (Then he raised his left hand, which only had three fingers) Why would I have burned my fingers to offer to the Buddha?"</p>
<p>Naturally, I understood him, and admitted that there must be another reason why he was like this, but on the surface, I still teased him and said:</p>
<p>"See, you're not convinced! Didn't you just complain that others wouldn't scold you? With just a few words like that, you say people are sharp, then who would dare to point at your nose and scold you?"</p>
<p>So, he scratched his bald head embarrassedly, and stuttered with a smile:</p>
<p>"People are just that kind of muddle-headed thing. You can't always do things according to your own heart, you have to mess yourself up. When I was a temple manager, my master scolded and beat me every day, wasn't that good? All the sins of eating alcohol and meat were eliminated. But, that's how it is in theory, but people are always people, not made of paper, so, in the end, I still slipped away and ran out to live this wandering alms-seeking life. At first, I was free and unfettered, but later I felt that if this went on, my sins would become even more serious, and I became more and more uncomfortable, so I planned to run back to the temple again. It would be good to be scolded by that old monk, but when I thought of the fierceness with which he scolded, who would want to bring bad luck on themselves? In this case, I could only scold myself."</p>
<p>I laughed and said:</p>
<p>"Actually, what I've heard is that you're scolding other monks who eat, drink, and gamble in every sentence."</p>
<p>He tugged at his round-collared robe and said:</p>
<p>"Am I the one who dropped this off?"</p>
<p>"Don't say anymore, old sly fox, I know, you're an old monk scolding people, and a young monk eating, drinking, and gambling at the same time, so you have the best of both worlds and are very carefree!"</p>
<p>Seeing that I was being so harsh to him, he shook his bald head and said painfully:</p>
<p>"Friend, I haven't fallen to that point yet, I haven't fallen to that point yet."</p>
<p>Immediately, he sighed, blaming himself:</p>
<p>"Alas, I deserve to be scolded! I deserve to be scolded!"</p>
<p>I said solemnly:</p>
<p>"It seems that you shouldn't have become a monk in the first place, you really took the wrong path."</p>
<p>"No!" he replied just as solemnly, raising his incomplete hand, "I felt that this path was right from the start! Do you know how this finger disappeared? (He pointed at the little finger of his left hand with the index finger of his right hand) It was scolded away by my dad. I secretly gambled a few times, and he jumped up and down cursing me, scolding me so badly that I was heartbroken, and I couldn't bear it anymore, so I dragged a kitchen knife, and without saying a word, I chopped off my finger. At the time, he was very remorseful, saying that if I didn't gamble, it was fine, why did I have to do that?"</p>
<p>I also exclaimed:</p>
<p>"You really went too far."</p>
<p>"Too far! You don't know, at the time, I felt like there was a pot of fire burning in my heart, if I didn't do that, he would simply scold me to death. When he felt remorse, I felt much better, and even when I saw the blood gushing out of my finger, I felt that it was a worthwhile thing to do. Who knew what happened later, I was really a damned fellow, in less than a year, I was secretly playing cards and throwing dice again, don't laugh, maybe if you were in my situation, you might have done the same thing. I'm telling you, my dad's method was really too much, he kept me locked up at home all day, afraid that I would spend money, afraid that I would spend money, and he wouldn't even pay for my school fees to go to the county seat, he was just so stingy! How can a young man live a lifeless life at home all the time? This way, the problem came, at first I secretly took a break once or twice, but later it became more and more rotten, I completely forgot about the matter of chopping off my finger. When my dad found out that I had secretly taken out a lot of money and lost it all, he was furious. At first, he gave me a solid beating, and later he wanted to kick me out the door. Relatives and family members came to persuade him, but he wouldn't listen, saying that even if I chopped off both my arms, he wouldn't believe that I would change my ways. As for myself, looking at my chopped-off finger, I felt that even if I was determined to change, I wouldn't dare to have any confidence. In this case, I could only become a monk, and let the Bodhisattva dispose of me as he saw fit. Don't laugh, when I first entered the temple, seeing that everything was clean everywhere, I believed that I would get better. I felt an indescribable joy every morning and evening when I heard the sound of the bell. I lived there for two years, never leaving the temple even a step, spending all day reciting Buddha and cultivating myself. I even thought, if my dad, that old thing, came and saw me, would he still dare to say nonsense? I was really proud of myself. Who knew that we unlucky people would never become Buddhas. Alas."</p>
<p>Speaking to this point, he sighed deeply, and only after I urged him did he continue.</p>
<p>"It was just one day when the temple was doing some kind of event, and many laywomen and lay grandmothers came. I was greatly surprised, why did those young women and tender wives, whom I had always been accustomed to seeing, seem so...alas."</p>
<p>He blushed embarrassedly.</p>
<p>"The next day, the temple became quiet again, but I became uneasy, I even forgot how many times to ring the bell. When I was sweeping the floor, I saw the footprints left on the green moss by the stairs yesterday, and I was a little dazed, not wanting to sweep them away. I was thinking about going outside all day. The red and green wild flowers by the small ditch, which I had never paid much attention to before, also made me very concerned. Even the sunlight shining in the temple seemed not as bright or beautiful as the sunlight in the fields. Day by day, I even hated the sound of the bell, which I used to like to hear, and the smell of sandalwood, which I liked to smell. I secretly told an old monk about this situation, and he said that I was possessed by a demon. I asked him if there was any way to be saved? He said there was, but it was a little bitter, which was to burn my fingers to offer to the Buddha.</p>
<p>While raising his left hand, he continued.</p>
<p>Looking at it, my fourth finger, that's how it ended up. At the time, it really hurt to the bone, and I felt dizzy, and had no evil thoughts at all. Later, when the finger healed, huh, evil thoughts still crept in. In this case, everything was over.</p>
<p>Alas, I deserve to be scolded! I deserve to be scolded!"</p>
<p>His dejected appearance deeply moved me, so I made a plan for him:</p>
<p>"Actually, you can return to secular life! Are you still afraid of others scolding you?"</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of being scolded, actually I want people to scold me. It's just this skin that has harmed me, having worn it for more than ten years, I've become someone who can't carry anything on my shoulders or lift anything with my hands."</p>
<p>He said with emotion, raising his right hand to straighten his clothes.</p>
<p>I saw that the little finger of his right hand was also missing, and I wanted to ask what the reason was, but I was afraid of causing him even more pain, so I didn't ask.</p>
<p>Reading Notes</p>
<h3>Caesar and the Masses</h3>
<p>— Nangong Li</p>
<p>I have seen the English translation of Chepayev published by the "Overseas Soviet Workers Publishing Federation," and I have also seen the Chinese film adapted from this book, translated as Chapaev. The impression that this story gave me was consistent both times: I was amazed by the power of the masses expressed in this historical fact. I felt that they understood what was beneficial and harmful, knew right from wrong, and made definite choices, not as foolish as some people imagine. And I also thought that the masses in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, are not necessarily foolish. Mr. So-and-so read Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, and was shocked by the "blindness" and "lack of reason" of the masses, and from this decided that he "still needed a little experience in being human." This was said in the past. Three years later, I don't know if he has that "experience" now. However, the ancient Roman masses depicted by Shakespeare, although foolish, actually have reason. They also want to recognize right and wrong, and what is beneficial and harmful, and are not blind. It's just that because they are in the dark, even though they have their eyes open, they still can't see anything. Mr. So-and-so only paid attention to the five senses of the masses, but forgot about the time of Caesar.</p>
<p>However, the focus of the article is not here. He also "painfully" compares China to Rome now, "painfully" describes the chicken-greeting-chicken, dog-greeting-dog masses of "recent centuries." "Ignorance," "blindness," "lack of reason," and being easily "incited" are of course unavoidable accusations. But, I also thought: Mr. So-and-so has forgotten the actual situation, and forgotten the oppression that the Caesar-style system gave to the masses. There are definitely not that many congenital mental defectives in the world.</p>
<p>Not even in ancient Rome.</p>
<p>The Roman citizens who loved freedom and hated the imperial system were killed, imprisoned, and exiled batch after batch under Caesar's rule, and finally only a few gray slaves who dared not have any hope were left. Therefore, Caesar had an army behind him to assist his ambitions; but the Republicans in the Senate didn't even have a backing. This is not accidental. People who sigh at the birds in cages and blame them for not being able to fly far are typical of those who sneer at the ignorance of the masses.</p>
<p>However, besides scoffers, there are also zealous patriots in the world.</p>
<p>In 44 BC, Caesar was stabbed to death in the Senate at the foot of the statue of his enemy Pompey the Great. Shakespeare used a realistic style and excellent artistic skill to depict the last moments of this invincible hero. When Brutus followed Casca and thrust his dagger, Caesar cried out in surprise:</p>
<p>"What, Brutus, are you also doing this? Then let me die!"</p>
<p>Caesar died, and the citizens of Rome regained their freedom and light. Unexpectedly, thousands of years later, the Caesar-style system has been revived, doesn't Mussolini want to rebuild a Roman Empire? If you say that the people of Italy in the 20th century are all a "chicken-greeting-chicken, dog-greeting-dog" mass, I will never believe it.</p>
<p>I also don't believe that China only has such masses.</p>
<p>Even in recent events, the resistance of the volunteer army in Guanwai, and the national salvation of students and workers in the country, fully demonstrate that the Chinese masses have reason and know right from wrong. However, due to the limitations of the objective environment, they may sometimes be depressed. This is not their inherent ignorance.</p>
<h3>Overcoming</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>The story of how the blind Shu Gen overcame the female secretary, Pei Pa Xi, who looked down on him—a sociable woman with no knowledge of social matters—is as follows:</p>
<p>Every Sunday afternoon, Shu Gen lectured at gatherings of young people. He wore a plain, pure white suit, a black tie, and his shoes and hat were of light colors. His dark crystal glasses were too heavy, so he and the female secretary, Pei Pa Xi, went to Nanjing Road and chose a pair of tea-crystal lenses that would enhance his handsomeness. Young students arrived in luxurious taxis to greet him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Li Gen—" they bowed respectfully, their heads tilted, their hands resting on the gray hard buttons of their military training uniforms. Their bones were not fully developed, and their hair was long, uneven, and unruly. They liked to use two-character pen names and refused to tell others their real surnames. "Sit down, sit down," the editor greeted them warmly, shaking hands enthusiastically with each other.</p>
<p>On the podium, those poor, mysterious students, with their voices as underdeveloped as their bodies, whispered a few introductory words and then slipped away. When the editor, Shu Gen, heard the applause welcoming him, he walked forward, calmly bowed, and stood on the podium like a very serious plaster statue. "Respectable young gentlemen—the lifeblood of the nation, the vital spirit of the people—" he began. He invaded the realms of philosophy, political science, and general social issues with his widely disseminated knowledge. His language was found to have an unprecedented agility and acuteness... Finally, he said:</p>
<p>"Just as I said, the literary world must also use you, the respectable young gentlemen with vigorous creativity, as a standing army to drive out the muddle-headed and senile fellows. I am waiting for your expulsion!... I—have an irreparable physiological defect, just like what your Xiao Su said: a blind man! I fight with every bookstore owner to find certainty, but damn it, they think pseudo-youths are not qualified for their products, those slaves!..."</p>
<p>Sitting in the carriage taking him home, he discovered that his carelessly spoken words, which were not fully prepared, had precisely met the ardent needs of the young people. They clapped for a long time, shouting and expressing their unrestrained joy, surrounding him and not letting him leave.... He was dazed and surprised, his whole body numb. The female secretary anxiously asked him about the results of each lecture, but he only smiled and nodded, unable to give a definite report.</p>
<p>Accepting Pei Pa Xi's request, he took her to the lecture. Sitting reservedly at the edge of the young people, she saw with her own eyes that they were frantically addicted to him, like Cantonese sedan carriers addicted to singers.</p>
<p>"Bassre, please draft this for me, listen to what I say."</p>
<p>Her face flushed, and she accepted Wan Gen's instructions with trepidation, listening with excessive caution to every word he said, working piously and diligently.</p>
<p>Then one day, Li Gen said solemnly to Pei Pa Xi.</p>
<p>"Look at my achievements, look...! Alas! It's a pity you can't believe it.—A serious struggle, I have begun—I am determined to be the number one person in all of China!... This person, who saved the personality of all editors!"</p>
<p>Pei Pa Xi, as if inexplicably subjected to a major insult, fell into a state of distress, not speaking or singing, walking listlessly without any spirit. She did not believe Li Gen could do anything better, but she could not resist him either.</p>
<h3>Thinking of Drama</h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>What I want to write about now is drama, but I don't know whether to admit that I understand a little about drama or that I don't understand anything at all.</p>
<p>With courage, perhaps in five minutes, I can confidently call myself a playwright.</p>
<p>In the first minute, write a script:</p>
<p>"Curtain up. A cat runs across the quiet, empty stage. Curtain down."</p>
<p>This script can easily produce a director and stage manager in two minutes.</p>
<p>With two minutes left, write a review. Discuss the difference between a cat and a dog, and thus how Chinese Dadaism differs from Italian Dadaism.</p>
<p>To become a playwright in this way would be too absurd; but to only become a minor playwright in this way would be too miserable.</p>
<p>In situations where everything has to be compromised, we already have many all-rounders, so why add another?</p>
<p>But to squeeze into the crowd of all-rounders, one must not be denied by the experts.</p>
<p>The conditions for not being denied by the experts are mostly unrelated to the play itself.</p>
<p>Regarding the play, the only thing a practitioner has to do is admit the inaccessibility of the expert's theories or techniques.</p>
<p>Without theory, without technique, what kind of drama would it be? This question is precisely what leaves room for the experts to show off their abilities.</p>
<p>Sometimes experts also have to try to be all-rounders, but that is when they temporarily abandon their role as experts.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no need to hope or regret that the dramas produced by experts carry an expert aura.</p>
<p>As for whether a playwright understands drama, a fairly conclusive answer can be reached here. But at the same time, one also feels that, as a reader or audience member, the question of understanding has a different effect.</p>
<p>I don't know if anyone has said that drama is something for the audience to choose. Our drama, however, traditionally chooses its audience.</p>
<p>The era when being chosen was admired was the golden age of the theater.</p>
<p>The selection of Kunqu opera still exists, and its pride has not diminished, but it can no longer have an effect on the general audience.</p>
<p>Pihuang opera still has great potential, but although there are expectant voters, the old voters often reject it, and the result will be the same as Kunqu opera, a national demise.</p>
<p>Spoken drama has never reached the point where being chosen is an honor; its golden age has not yet come.</p>
<p>The lament that too few people understand drama can often be heard.</p>
<p>At the same time, some people lament that they cannot see dramas and are bored reading scripts in their rooms.</p>
<p>Reading scripts ignites the desire to see plays. But occasional opportunities to see plays always make people feel that reading scripts is more satisfying.</p>
<p>Some scripts can't be staged at all, some people say, but others say that all scripts can be staged.</p>
<p>Before Eugene O'Neill met the people at the Provincetown Players, no one believed that his scripts could be performed.</p>
<p>It is excusable for established theater managers not to take risks.</p>
<p>Dilemmas turn into reasons, and reasons turn into rules, and easily followed rules are naturally easily insisted upon.</p>
<p>What the general public can understand is naturally often not the same as what people in the theater understand.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we cannot say that we understand drama.</p>

<p>Writer Introduction</p>
<h3>The Death of Ostrovsky</h3>
<p>— Lin Qi</p>
<p>A Great Soviet Disabled Writer</p>
<p>Famous for his book “How the Steel Was Tempered”</p>
<p>The young Soviet disabled writer Nikolai Ostrovski ended his heroic struggle on December 12, 1936.</p>
<p>Ostrovsky's short life was spent enduring incredible hardships. In the early days of the revolution, he was still a child, washing dishes in a Ukrainian train station canteen, enduring the scolding and kicking of the owner and servants. But the movement at that time helped the development of his wit and courage, and he threw himself into the movement. He greatly assisted the secret work at that time. At the age of fifteen, he, like all other young people, dedicated his youthful blood to the revolutionary war, joining the Ukrainian Red Cavalry and the Communist Youth League. After countless hand-to-hand combats with the enemy, he charged through many enemy fortifications on horseback. Finally, in a pursuit, a huge shell exploded in front of him, seriously injuring him.</p>
<p>In the Red Army hospital, after proper recuperation, he was able to temporarily regain his health. He immediately plunged into the whirlpool of work again. In industry, farms, and railways, with his inexhaustible sincerity and enthusiasm, he helped the economic and cultural construction of the new society. Soon, typhoid fever knocked him down again. But he broke free from the clutches of death again, stood up, and still participated brilliantly in the propaganda, organization, and leadership of the expanded Communist Youth League work. He constantly fought against various deviations, striking blows at bureaucracy and empty talkers. His young, brave, and powerful steps shattered all obstacles and poisonous insects along the way. His activities brought glory and victory. The gates of life were unfolding before him.</p>
<p>At this time, the long-hidden old wound suddenly flared up, and the disease began to erode his body. Headaches, nervous system weakness, and the strong attack of typhoid fever made him lose his ability to work, and he had to have a longer period of recuperation. But as soon as the recuperation period was over, regardless of the doctor's concern about his illness and advice not to work so excessively, he immediately returned to the working group and led the activities of the Communist Youth League in an industrial area. He could not live without work. In a letter to his brother, he wrote: "In this world, there is nothing more terrible for me than falling behind on the battlefield. It is simply unimaginable." But disaster did not let go of its prey because of this. His leg was run over by a car, so he had to undergo surgery and recuperate again.</p>
<p>Misfortune happened one after another. The left leg also became paralyzed, followed by the arms and wrists. At this time, he was only twenty-four years old, the time when life was full of color and fragrance, work and love; yet he had to endure the pain of losing the ability to move his limbs and lying helplessly in bed. Modern medicine still has no ability to help him escape this tragic situation. But he did not despair, he still struggled. He asked to take on some cultural work that did not require physical activity, but was refused because he had not received a good education in the past and did not write well.</p>
<p>Subsequently, greater disaster shattered his body and mind. He lost his eyes forever, sinking into boundless darkness. He could no longer see the sun, flowers, the smiles of comrades, and lively youth. He held the cold pistol in his hand, wanting to end his life in this way several times. But he was ultimately a brave fighter in life, and he overcame that shameful temptation.</p>
<p>People performed another complex surgery for him, cutting his spine and twisting his neck, but all in vain. With his remaining life and vitality, he began to help the construction of the new society from another aspect. He decided to engage in literature. His close friends in the Communist Youth League sent him a radio, and everyone took turns reading works to him aloud. He diligently studied grammar and classical literature. Under these difficult conditions, he began to write his first work. He could often recite entire paragraphs or pages of what he had written. If there was no one nearby to immediately record a good composition or sentence that he suddenly thought of, he would tell the radio his ideas and record them on a record. He sent his debut work out for others to critique, but the post office lost it all. But he was not discouraged by this.</p>
<p>From 1930 to 1934, it took him four years to write his own experiences into that shocking masterpiece, "How the Steel Was Tempered" (How the Steel Was Tempered L), in two volumes. In this book, he successfully portrayed the attitude of a childhood soldier who grew up in the revolution and was tempered into steel by the revolutionary reality. It is not accurate to say that this is a purely autobiographical replica. Although there are still some shortcomings in artistic achievement, the overflowing youthful spirit, fresh strength, brave spirit, and the thorough realism depicted, he created for us a "typical character in a typical environment." It is no accident that he was able to receive the Order of Lenin.</p>
<p>Following "How the Steel Was Tempered," with the assistance of the Sochi City Committee, Ostrovsky continued to work ten to twelve hours a day, working on the film script of this novel, and also engaged in his third novel, "Son of the Storm." In his zombie-like body, there was a fiery passion and steel-like faith. However, human power still cannot completely conquer nature. This great and young heart finally stopped beating last month. How can we not express our mourning and regret with the most sublime respect for his tragic and short life, and at the same time be encouraged and infected ourselves?</p>

<p>Discussion on Fur Coats and Overcoats</p>
<h3>Fur Talk</h3>
<p>— Yichen</p>
<p>Between the invasion of foreign woolen fabrics, the general fashion-conscious modern woman, in order to show off her curves, is unwilling to use fur to make fur coats. This is an ironclad fact. They would rather wear single-layer cheongsams in this winter, with narrow sleeves and slender waists, and put on a foreign-made woolen overcoat on the outside, regardless of shivering skin and chattering teeth. Some even don't wear an overcoat, freezing their faces red. I think this is their own fault. In practical terms, they are not saving money, but exposing their curves. You should know that wearing a fur coat can prevent internal heat from escaping and external cold from invading, giving you the courage to resist the God of Winter and saving a great deal of money for the national economy. I hope that fashionable ladies will wear more fur coats. It is beneficial to yourself and the country. Why not do it? Moreover, the Sage Confucius not only liked to wear fur clothes, but also had artistic designs for his fur clothes! I'm not just talking nonsense. There is such a record in the "Analects of Confucius, Township Party": "A black lambskin coat with a black lining, a white deerskin coat with plain clothes, a yellow fox fur coat, a long casual coat, with a short right sleeve." In these few words, it covers how to prepare fur goods, how to design and match them, where to wear what fur goods, and what size should the fur goods be. Because it is a lambskin coat, it is matched with black clothes, a deerskin coat with plain clothes, and a fox fur coat with yellow clothes. Isn't this Confucius's artistic design? Moreover, in order to keep warm, he often lengthened his fur clothes, and in order to make work more convenient, he shortened the right sleeve slightly. Now, in the nationwide atmosphere of respecting Confucius, we should follow Confucius's advocacy of fur clothes. Fashionable ladies, you should quickly realize that this is your responsibility as fashionable ladies. It can also save a lot of money. Although you can't imitate Yanzi wearing a fox fur coat for thirty years, at least you won't think it's worn out in three or five years. Furthermore, according to the season, the "Rites of Zhou" says: "The Tian Guan Siqiu is in charge of making large fur coats to supply the king's sacrificial clothing. Good fur coats are presented in mid-autumn, and finished fur coats are presented in late autumn." Moreover, in the current winter, there is nothing better than heavy fur coats to save you from the cold.</p>
<p>Now I will summarize a few stories about fur to conclude.</p>
<p>Buying Wine with Su Suo Fur Coat. Sima Xiangru and Wen Jun returned to Chengdu. Because they were worried and unhappy, they thought that wine could relieve their worries, but they had no money. So they had to sell their Su Suo fur coat to Yang Chang to buy wine to relieve their worries. Finding pleasure in poverty is not a new thing. The "Western Capital Miscellaneous Records" records it like this: "When Sima Xiangru first returned to Chengdu with Zhuo Wenjun, he lived in poverty and worry. He sold his Su Suo fur coat to a merchant named Yang Chang to buy wine and have fun with Wen Jun."</p>
<p>Stealing and Offering Fox White Fur Coat to Save Himself. Qin imprisoned Lord Mengchang, and Lord Mengchang asked for help from Xin Ji, the concubine of King Zhao of Qin. But Xin Ji did not propose any conditions, only wanting the fox white fur coat that had been offered to King Zhao, so that Lord Mengchang could be released. This was difficult for Lord Mengchang. Fortunately, a guest was able to steal like a dog, so he went to steal the fox white fur coat and offered it to Xin Ji. Then Lord Mengchang was released. This is recorded in the "Historical Records."</p>
<p>Not Taking Off Fur Coat in Summer. The "Essentials of Categories" states: "Zhang Zhihe often made fur coats with coarse cloth, which his sister-in-law made herself. Even in the summer, he would not take it off." This is too ridiculous. Does he really wear a fur coat all year round like in the Arctic Ocean?</p>
<h3>An Economist's Economic Words</h3>
<p>— Hu Kai</p>
<p>Only Fur Goods Can Resist the Cold in Winter</p>
<p>Old Chen has a round face. He has a mustache. He always has a smile on his face. He is short and fat. At first glance, he is a person over fifty years old. His shining eyes and fluent eloquence show that he is a shrewd businessman. He owns a double-front rice store. His business is very developed. Although he has assets of forty to fifty thousand, he values money like his life. He usually does not easily waste a penny. He often says, "A penny can kill a hero." You must think of nothing when you have something. Don't wait until you have nothing. If you want something, you must weigh everything carefully and choose the cheapest way to do it. The neighbors called him an "economic expert" for calculating four ounces of bones from an eggshell. He did not deny it himself. Yes, Old Chen does have some skills. When buying things, they must be cheap and of good quality.</p>
<p>Every winter, Old Chen himself, Old Chen's wife, and two sons and a daughter all wear fur goods. This made the neighbors suspicious. They secretly said. Old Chen is frugal in everything else, but how can he be so extravagant in what he wears?</p>
<p>One day, Mr. Lu, the owner of the cloth shop next door, invited Mr. Chen to have a New Year's Eve dinner. Old Chen thought. The friends in the cloth shop are very well dressed. I have always been inferior to them. Today, I will not show weakness. I want to compete with them. He casually asked his wife to bring the newly made fur coat. His wife readily agreed. He ran upstairs to take out a newly made fur coat and ran downstairs to hand it to Old Chen. Old Chen smiled and put the new coat on his body, proud and happy, and went. He stepped into the cloth shop's guest room. He saw three tables sitting in a circle, waiting for him to arrive. Old Chen sat down without ceremony. He didn't know what was going on. The guests at the table stared intently at Old Chen. After two rounds of wine, the host, Mr. Lu, couldn't help but open his mouth and said to Old Chen. Mr. Chen, do you know why the guests here today are all looking at you? Old Chen answered very happily. It's because I'm wearing a newly made fur coat. The guests at the table laughed. Mr. Lu replied to Old Chen. Mr. Chen, I'm not joking with you. Our store eats two stones of rice every month. If you calculate it for a year, how much business do you do with us? Besides cutting some single-layer clothes and some domestically produced lining cloth, you rarely trade with our woolen and camel hair lining goods. Don't you wear cotton? Old Chen smiled and replied. Mr. Lu, don't you see that we are wearing fur robes? Before he finished speaking, Xiao Wang at the same table interjected. Old Chen. Others say you are economic. You are really not economic at all. Just talking about clothes, your whole family wears fur goods. Each piece costs dozens of gold. Then this expense is large. Is this supposed to be economic? Old Chen took a sip of wine. He ate some dishes. He paused. He smiled and said to Xiao Wang. Xiao Wang. Others respect me as an "economic expert." I also admit that I am a shrewd economic expert. Is my calculation wrong? Ordinary cotton robes also cost ten or eight yuan to wear for one or two years. The cotton will harden and have no ability to resist the cold. If you make it beautiful, then foreign camel hair at one yuan and five corners a foot and Matani at one yuan and five corners a foot will not be effective if you wear it on your body. If you spend thirty or forty yuan to buy a leather tube, match it with a solid face, and wear it warmly and lightly. You will wear it this year and next year. You will wear it again the year after. You will wear it every year. When others see me wearing a fur robe, they always say that I am rich. Wearing a fur robe every year is actually much cheaper than wearing a cotton robe and a camel hair robe. Like the fur robe I am wearing, I bought it when I first arrived in Shanghai. Now it has been more than twenty years. I have only changed the face. It is still a fur robe. Mr. Lu joked again. Mr. Chen. Are you really uneconomical this year? How come you are even wearing a fur coat? Old Chen said. What can I say? I am getting older year by year. My body is getting weaker year by year. It is really unbearable to run out wearing only a fur robe. I wanted to make a coat to wear. I ran to a suit and overcoat store. I asked about the price of woolen overcoats. They said that they were foreign new arrivals. Each piece was a special price of eighty yuan. The workmanship was free. I was so scared that I jumped out. I ran home. On the way, I thought. A woolen overcoat. The special price is eighty yuan. Wearing it on the body is said to resist the cold. I am afraid it will be ineffective. It is said to be beautiful. First, it is not like me. Second, there is nothing special about it. When I got home, I talked about this matter. My son said, "Father, don't you know that the fur industry is promoting fur coats this year? In order to strive for universality, the fur industry is especially aiming at 'cheap and good quality.'" Since Father wants to make a coat, you might as well take a look. I stood up and ran. I walked to the fur industry center area. I spent fifty yuan to make a high-quality fur coat. It just happened to be invited by Mr. Lu to eat a New Year's Eve dinner. I want to show off. I put on this new fur coat. It is indeed warm and beautiful. It is very suitable for me. I am the only one who is respected in front of the public. Haha! Old Chen said a lot. Then he drank a glass of wine. He said again. Based on my decades of experience. In winter, the only cold-resistant material is fur goods. It is the most economical and the most durable. Besides fur goods, there is nothing better.</p>
<p>After a while, the banquet dispersed. Everyone admired Old Chen's insightful opinions. The sea deeply imprinted Old Chen's fur coat, which was uniquely healthy, and kept in mind the experienced words that fur goods are the only items that can resist the cold in winter.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Thoughts on Reforming Leather Robes</h3>
<p>— Zhou Siyong</p>
<p>When the north wind howls and white snow dances, this publication has specially opened a "Leather Robe and Overcoat Discussion" column, which is indeed well-suited to practical needs, especially since clothing is so closely related to people.</p>
<p>In winter, the purpose of clothing is, of course, first and foremost to keep warm. As for the clothes that are most effective at keeping warm, there are mainly two types: leather robes and overcoats. This is also the scope of this article's discussion.</p>
<p>When it comes to leather robes and overcoats, which is better and which is worse? I believe that leather robes are superior to overcoats. If you don't believe me, there are facts to prove it: First, leather robes are cheaper than overcoats. The cheapest, most inferior overcoat costs at least fourteen or fifteen yuan. If paired with a suit, scarf, etc., it will cost no less than thirty or forty yuan. If you spend fourteen or fifteen yuan to buy a leather robe, the quality will already be quite good. The padded jacket and trousers worn underneath are also much cheaper than a suit, making it very economical. Second, leather robes are more effective at keeping warm than overcoats. Leather items become warm as soon as you put them on, and the longer you wear them, the warmer they get, feeling like a stove when worn. But overcoats are short, stiff, and thin, and not as warm as a leather robe when first worn, yet they are incredibly heavy. Third, leather robes are lighter than overcoats. Thick wool overcoats in winter are often as heavy as a dead ox. If someone with a weak body wears one, they will feel overwhelmed by the weight. Leather robes, on the other hand, are lighter than overcoats, soft and not as suffocating as overcoats. Although lower-quality leather robes can also be heavy, they are still much lighter than lower-quality overcoats.</p>
<p>While leather robes have the advantages mentioned above, they are not without their shortcomings. The most prominent ones are: First, they are too long, making walking and getting on vehicles inconvenient. Second, it's not easy to wash them when they get dirty. Third, the lower part is too wide, allowing wind to easily enter. Fourth, the neck area is too thin and cannot withstand the cold wind. To address these issues, the following reforms are necessary:</p>
<p>First, the length of the robe should be shortened, preferably about two inches above the heel. The fur should not drag on the ground, making it easier to move around. It will also be less likely to get dirty. Dr. Liu Hong'en, President of Shanghai University, is a strong advocate for shortening robes. His robes are less than three inches below the knee, and many people, especially university professors, follow his example.</p>
<p>Second, the current manufacturing method should be improved to make leather robes easier to wash. The best way to do this is to not sew the leather and the robe material together. Instead, use snaps to fasten them. The lining should be made in two layers, which will make it more stylish and avoid the unsightly appearance of snaps. When washing is needed, the leather can be removed. At the same time, it can also be worn as an unlined robe in the spring and autumn, which is both convenient and economical.</p>
<p>Third, the lower part should be made smaller, no more than one foot and two inches long. The side with the buttons should have two more buttons to prevent wind from blowing in. The advantage of overcoats is that the lower part is tight and small, which is worth emulating.</p>
<p>Fourth, there should be two collars, one regular one for when the weather is not too cold, and one made of leather, which should be higher and larger. When it is cold, it can be turned up to protect the neck and prevent cold wind from entering. The sewing method should also use snaps, so that the collar can be chosen based on the temperature, avoiding the problems of being too cold or too hot.</p>
<p>If leather robes undergo the above reforms, they will be much more comfortable to wear and much better than bulky overcoats!</p>
<h3>Leather Robes and Overcoats – Suitable for the Tastes of the Chinese People</h3>
<p>— Jianqing</p>
<p>When I was a child, I heard a joke about a French student who came back to admire the moon and said that everything in China was inferior, even the moon was not as big as the one seen in Paris. Although this statement is absurd, there is an explanation: in Paris, the prosperity of the city highlights the brilliance of the moon. Conversely, in the Chinese countryside, the surroundings are quiet, which highlights the blandness of the moon. The difference between the two is easy to see, but we cannot criticize which one is good and which one is bad. The moon in Paris is made more luxurious by the neon lights on the ground, while the moon in the countryside is made more pure by the natural setting. Each has its own beauty and suits the tastes of different people.</p>
<p>Since the 19th century, thanks to modern inventions – steamships – and our thousands-year-old legacy – the compass – all the material civilization of the West has been crammed into this closed-off China. They have cannons, so we have to learn to build them. They have warships, so we have to buy them. That's fine, but in this era of change, a kind of blind faith in the West has emerged. For example, they have foreign languages, so we should learn them. However, we should not abandon the original writing of our motherland, but should further study and improve it. This is because we Chinese naturally have our own characteristics and special environment, and we cannot cut our feet to fit the shoes and cater to all Western imports.</p>
<p>Clothing is one of the four major necessities of life: clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and it is the most intimate to people. In this regard, Western suits have their advantages, and Chinese clothing has its advantages. For example, the advantage of Western suits is in their mental stimulation, while the advantage of Chinese clothing is in its comfort. From a physiological point of view, it avoids the constraints of many belts, allowing blood to circulate naturally. At the same time, it is also better at protecting body temperature than Western suits. Western Europeans also gradually improved and manufactured their Western suits. Now, the Chinese, with their different environment, climate, and geology, want to directly and completely accept them without making any improvements, which will of course not be suitable.</p>
<p>Human beings have the ability to improve and progress. We feel that Western houses do not suit the tastes of the Chinese people, so there are houses that combine Chinese and Western styles, with a Chinese exterior and a Western interior. Why do we still stick to the old ways when it comes to the problem of Western suits, especially overcoats? Why do we wear wool overcoats in the cold winter wind without thinking about making improvements?</p>
<p>Therefore, we should support the promotion of leather robes and overcoats. The advantages of leather robes and overcoats are:</p>
<p>㊀ Warmth: Everyone admits that animal skin has the best warmth retention. The purpose of an overcoat is of course to keep warm. Wearing a wool overcoat in the middle and northern parts of China in winter is not enough. This shortcoming of wool overcoats is the advantage of leather robes and overcoats.</p>
<p>㊁ Comfort: Leather robes and overcoats are made of leather. Wool overcoats are too stiff and restrictive. Leather and fur are soft, light, and comfortable.</p>
<p>㊂ Beauty: Leather robes and overcoats have complex colors, unlike the simple colors of wool overcoats. We dare not say that more complex colors are necessarily beautiful, but I believe that with good harmony, they must be more beautiful.</p>
<p>㊃ Patriotism: China's northwest produces leather. Wearing leather robes and overcoats is promoting domestic products and reversing China's economic misfortunes.</p>
<p>Some of the above advantages may not be suitable for Westerners, so we can know that the biggest advantage of leather robes and overcoats is still that they are suitable for the Chinese people, which avoids the need to cut our feet to fit the shoes, which would be a major reform.</p>
<h3>A Worthy-of-Promoting Outdated Garment – The Leather Outer Jacket</h3>
<p>— Jieyu</p>
<p>Of the clothing styles from the Qing Dynasty, two are worth promoting: (1) using the cheongsam to replace women's skirts, and (2) using the leather outer jacket to replace the overcoat. Now the cheongsam has become a common garment, but the outer jacket is still regarded as an antique, and no one has promoted it, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, no one would have believed that the cheongsam would become a common garment for women. Because at that time, the costumes of Manchuria were all regarded as remnants of the imperial system, and people could not ban them fast enough. Who would dare to openly promote them? However, the simplicity of the facts can eventually defeat unnecessary psychological obstacles. Moreover, the establishment of the Republic of China originally proclaimed the five races of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan to be united in one republic. We should learn from each other's strengths to make these five major ethnic groups assimilate into the national race of the Republic of China. Therefore, for the customs, habits, and clothing among these five races, we can only distinguish between good and bad, right and wrong, and we must not have discriminatory or contemptuous ideas. This is what I should explain to you before promoting the outer jacket style from the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>Replacing the overcoat with a leather robe originally fulfilled the obligation of promoting domestic products. However, the procedure of putting it on and taking it off is relatively troublesome. Moreover, two long garments tightly wrapped around the body are inconvenient for walking. Therefore, those who promote it do so with great enthusiasm, but those who wear it are still reluctantly following. As a result, it is ultimately difficult to popularize it. If the leather robe on the outside can be changed to an outer jacket style, the cuffs and hem can be enlarged, and buttons can be replaced with ties, making it easier to put on and take off, and walking will not be more difficult than with an overcoat.</p>
<p>Moreover, the leather outer jacket that I am promoting does not necessarily have to be like the official robes of the Qing Dynasty. We can still make local changes according to the general style of the outer jacket. For example, the collar can be made into a movable lapel, and hand pockets can be added to the sides. It is still made of plain satin or flowered twill, with colors such as sky blue, navy blue, and coffee. Compared with overcoats, I am afraid that it will only be more beautiful, and there will be no shortcomings!</p>
<p>If the buttons are used instead of ties, the left and right sides can be indistinguishable. If you pay a little attention when making the leather lining into clothing, so that the outer jacket can be worn inside out, it will be even more convenient.</p>
<p>Everything has a habit. When we changed from the outer jacket era to wearing overcoats, we regarded the outer jacket as an outdated relic. If we remake the overcoat into an outer jacket, there will be a day when people will regard the overcoat as shabby. However, at the beginning of a change in habit, it seems that there will be some surprises. When we abolished the outer jacket, haven't we had the same surprise? This requires social leaders to set an example first, and it also requires clothing companies to carry out special publicity.</p>
<h3>Promoting Leather Fur Clothing and the National Products Movement</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baling</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the national products industry, promoting leather fur clothing and the future of the national products movement are closely related. Because promoting leather fur clothing does contain a value that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>We all know that leather fur is a domestic product of China, which can keep out the cold and is light in weight. During the cold season, people with purchasing power, both men and women, like to make a leather robe to wear. People with sufficient economic ability certainly make one after another, and all kinds of leather are also collected. Even people with relatively weak economic ability cannot do without a leather robe. We only need to look at the large number of people wearing leather robes during this cold season to know that this is powerful proof, a concrete fact that speaks louder than words.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we deeply feel that wearing leather fur clothing not only protects the body from the cold and maintains health, but also has the significance of promoting national products. Because in this era, many people are keen on fashion, obsessed with Westernization, and like to wear imported Western suits in this cold season. If the materials of these Western suits are absolutely domestic woolen fabrics, that would be fine, but they often buy imported woolen fabrics, resulting in incalculable outflows of money. According to the statistics of the Jianghai Customs, the import of foreign woolen fabrics from January to November of the 25th year of the Republic of China reached 24,160,142 yuan in national currency. Ask yourself, how shocking is this number! However, the peak month for purchasing clothes, December, is not included in the statistics. If we combine all the import figures for the whole year, how will this huge number make people speechless!</p>
<p>Therefore, from the author's perspective, whether we talk about it from the perspective of keeping out the cold or from the perspective of promoting national products, we feel that it is necessary and valuable to promote leather fur clothing. If someone thinks that promoting leather fur clothing is outdated and a step backwards, then let me ask, is it a reasonable thing to allow the economic power of our compatriots to be completely absorbed by foreigners?</p>

<h3>The Situation in Shaanxi and Gansu Is Expected to Be Completely Resolved</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>When the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu was at its most tense, I had long expected that the Shaanxi-Gansu Incident would not be impossible to resolve, and there would definitely be hope for a peaceful resolution. Sure enough, yesterday's newspaper revealed the news that the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu is expected to be completely resolved, and that Wang Shuchang and Sun Weiru will take office soon. Although this news has not yet reached the stage of public confirmation, it is expected that the period of public confirmation will not be far away. Or, before this article is contributed to you, the readers, this news may have been confirmed.</p>
<p>My prediction is not like the fortune-tellers and character-splitting masters in Shanghai, who rely entirely on the five elements and the inspiration of the moment to analyze characters. My prediction is: After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek safely returned to Nanjing from Xi'an, no more incidents will occur in Shaanxi. Even if problems arise, they will not be too serious. The situation is extremely clear. Unexpectedly, after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing, Yang and Yu actually defied orders. This is really confusing.</p>
<p>I carefully considered the reasons for Yang and Yu's defiance of orders, and there must be considerable factors. Although we do not know these factors, we can see that the central government has a broad-minded intention. Not only does it not want to punish Yu and Yang severely, but it is also willing to be particularly lenient. If Yu and Yang can repent and reform themselves, they will not be seriously investigated. However, Yu and Yang, as soldiers, should know the duty of soldiers. When foreign disasters are deepening and the bandits and rebels are causing trouble, they dare to take such actions that undermine unity and disobey the central government. Not only is the national public opinion deeply saddened, but their conscience must be questioned.</p>
<p>I am sure of the above two points, so I dare to assert that the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu will be resolved peacefully. Even if there are any problems, after several negotiations, they can be easily solved and will never reach the point of breaking down again. Look at the current international situation, how serious it is. Any advocacy during this time should be sacrificed, and we should unite to resist the enemy desperately. If Yu and Yang do not wake up, the crime of harming the country is indeed something they cannot escape.</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Watching "The Thunderstorm"</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Amateur actors performing at the Carlton</p>
<p>"In short, I think it is necessary to introduce world dramas from the stage! However, what we should pay special attention to is: to make it have as much social impact as possible in our society." (Zhang Min: On the Introduction of World Famous Dramas)</p>
<p>What kind of "social impact" does the "Thunderstorm" directed by Mr. Zhang Min have in our society?</p>
<p>Comparing Ostrovsky's "Thunderstorm" with our current society, it is really too similar. How many grandmothers like Kapenovna and young wives like Katerina can you find in our society if you pay attention?</p>
<p>Ostrovsky is very loyal to his era. He made the poor Katerina, who had suffered so much, throw herself into the river, because he knew that the only way out for a young wife in such an environment was the so-called "eternal rest." The reason why she threw herself into the river was not only because her last supporter, her lover Boris, weakly left her, but also because when Katerina was still a girl, her life was spent with old women who went to temples to offer incense. During evening prayers, she would inexplicably cry and pray, without even knowing what she was praying for or what she was crying about. For a girl who grew up in such an environment, the only way out was to use death to relieve her suffering. In our society, in our countryside, aren't there many young wives who quietly commit suicide by throwing themselves into the river because they cannot bear the beatings and scoldings of their grandmothers or husbands? When they were girls, weren't they also spending their days "offering incense to temples" with old women?</p>
<p>However, in this gloomy story, Ostrovsky also foresaw another way for abused women. He made Varvara leave the family and follow her lover.</p>
<p>It is said that the amateur actors' performance of "Thunderstorm" this time is very faithful to the original work. I haven't read the script, so I have no way of knowing whether there are any differences. But from what I saw in this performance, I think the script can still be revised, for example, I think the third act should be omitted, and some dialogues in other acts can also be deleted. In this way, the impression of this tragedy will definitely be deeper than it is now. Although this would be a discount on being faithful to the original work.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the issue of being faithful to the original work should also be based on social impact as the major premise. In order to have a greater social impact in our society, even if there are some differences from the original work, it is okay to sacrifice some of the original work. Because of this, adapting world famous dramas to Chinese flavors has also become a necessary task!</p>
<p>For example, for "Thunderstorm", if amateur actors are willing to put in more effort, I believe that its social impact will definitely be more than this.</p>
<p>The director put a lot of effort into directing this play, which can be seen from the positions of the actors and their movements. The effect of each act is also as expected. If we separate the whole play into sections, it is really perfect. However, if we look at the whole six-act play, we always feel like something is missing. This may be due to a lack of momentum, but it seems a little inappropriate to say "lack of momentum." After a careful analysis, it is probably due to: ㊀ the limitations of the script, the division of the script is too loose for the main line; ㊁ the director probably paid too much attention to the drama in each act and neglected the connection between each act.</p>
<p>The stage design is really beautiful. I believe that in the Chinese theater scene, there has never been such a beautiful and realistic stage before, especially the first and fourth scenes. Such a beautiful stage is simply a painting full of poetry, a three-dimensional painting.</p>
<p>The effect in the first act was relatively poor (I watched the first day's afternoon performance), but it was very good in the fifth act. Due to experience and proficiency, it will definitely be better in the following performances.</p>
<p>The acting skills of the actors are mostly above average. What makes me even happier here are Ms. Lan Ping, Shu Xiuwen, Zhao Dan, and Ye Luqian, who accurately grasped the personality of each character and fully developed it. Others, such as Zheng Junli, Gu Erji, Zhang Manping, and Lu Ji, are also working hard and are very dedicated.</p>
<p>This is a play worth watching, and I dare to recommend it to you.</p>
<h3>In the Village</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hai</p>
<p>Early morning, the cold is biting, and the melted snow water from yesterday outside has frozen into transparent thin ice, and the ground is like a layer of glass. The camels lying quietly under the eaves are closing their eyes and not moving, as if they are listening to the hunting horn in the distance. The wind stopped, but the cold became even more biting.</p>
<p>"Sal! Sal!" The Buryat Mongolian who was traveling with me called out to the sleeping camel driver.</p>
<p>The camel driver Sal rubbed his eyes that had not had enough sleep and slowly got up. He smoked a cigarette and drove the camels to graze in the meadow.</p>
<p>Today it was Haoming and Susan's turn to cook. The Buryat Mongolian Baludan fetched water for his cooking partners and said to them kindly:</p>
<p>"You have to cook quickly! We are going to stroll around the village and come back for dinner in two hours! Oh! Don't forget to cook the two rabbits we bought yesterday!"</p>
<p>The sun came out. The American woman Jiepu carried her camera, and Volensky, who had been a classmate with me in Vladivostok since childhood, sang Siberian plains folk songs. Baludan always liked to walk with one hand on someone's shoulder. Now he walked in the front, and the four of us, like drunkards, sang and hummed and stepped into the village.</p>
<p>"It stinks! It's like entering a manure factory!" Jiepu said, covering her nose with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>There were piles of manure everywhere, emitting a strange smell, but we did not leave here immediately because of this. Dogs barked wildly, chasing us. Baludan asked the villagers in Mongolian to let the dogs not bite us. Sure enough, the middle-aged women or the elderly standing at the door quickly called the dogs into the house. We strolled around safely.</p>
<p>This is a dilapidated village, with few people, and everywhere presents a scene of poverty. The villagers looked at us with strange eyes, and some hid in the door, looking at the few of us through the cracks in the door. Perhaps they were afraid of foreigners, so they did not dare to look at us openly.</p>
<p>There were three women sitting in the sun doing work at the door of a house. Our appearance naturally surprised them, because Baludan spoke to them first, meaning to tell them not to be afraid. One of them was a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl, who looked very healthy and beautiful, exposing half of her leg, and using her hand to constantly rub hemp rope on her bare leg, already carrying the flavor of a semi-civilized person. Volensky said in my ear:</p>
<p>"Look! She is even more beautiful than Lilla!" Lilla was a Soviet woman I loved in Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Near the end of the village, there was an old jujube tree. The three of us leaned on the giant trunk of the jujube tree, and Jiepu took pictures of us. Then we sat on the root of the tree to rest. An old man appeared at the turn of the street, with a long white beard, wearing a purple robe. He walked slowly closer and spoke kindly to Baludan:</p>
<p>"Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"Kulen! We are all from Kulen!"</p>
<p>A smile appeared on his wrinkled old face, but soon he lowered his face, as if he suddenly remembered something. Finally, he spoke again:</p>
<p>"Are you going south? You probably haven't heard any rumors, have you? There is a war in Ikhe Zhao League (Suiyuan)! Chinese soldiers are fighting with short devils! The road ahead may not be easy. They often arrest passers-by as spies and punish them! ×× people often come here to recruit soldiers, and many young men are deceived by them, and it is said that they are all killed! Now no one will be fooled anymore. The gentleman is helping ×× fight the Chinese people, which is too conscienceless!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Old man, we are also preparing to fight, but we are going to resist the invasion of ××!" I excitedly said to the old man.</p>
<p>When we came back, the rice was cooked. We stood in the sun and ate our fill.</p>
<p>When we left Geer Village, the old man from before sent his son, a young and strong young man, to us:</p>
<p>"Everyone! Take my child with you, he can shoot a gun and shoots very accurately!"</p>
<p>Moving forward, we added a new partner!</p>
<h3>Snow Falling</h3>
<p>— Lin Ji</p>
<p>He woke up especially early this day. Opening his eyes, he saw that the half-old clock hanging on the wall read only 7:05. He believed this was the accurate time. His wife had already gotten up and was downstairs making him rice porridge. She was truly a good housewife. Even with a nanny, she still insisted on doing things herself, busying about in the kitchen. For such a wife, he thought he should give her something in return! Like buying her some fabric for a dress. Today was the end of the month, wasn't it, payday? Thinking this, he glanced at the calendar on the wall. Right, not a doubt about it, today was payday. So, he smiled and, sitting on the edge of the bed, made this decision: don't go straight home after getting paid. He would go to the department stores, the silk shops, and those places to pick out a beautiful cheongsam fabric and some children's toys to bring home. He wanted to do it without a sound, so when his wife saw it, she would first be surprised, then happy, and finally pout and complain that he shouldn't have gone off to spend money quietly when there were so many proper uses for it at home. The three-year-old child would receive those novel toys and shout "Good Daddy!" He would pick her up and kiss her, and then kiss her delicate little mouth. If his wife wanted to go out, he could even take her to see a movie at night and have a good time. His wife's life was really too monotonous...</p>
<p>Thinking this for a while, he didn't realize that his wife had already opened the door and brought in the wash water. She noticed that her husband had gotten up so early and seemed to feel sorry for him, as if he shouldn't have missed out on sleep. She said:</p>
<p>"Why are you up?"</p>
<p>The sky was gloomy, filled with heavy, gray clouds. It was past eight o'clock, but the sun hadn't come out yet. On the bus, people talking about the weather today kept expecting it to rain. But he felt the wind blowing sideways, and for some reason, it seemed particularly cold. Maybe it would snow! He thought.</p>
<p>No matter how cold it was outside, in the office on the third floor, it was warm enough to completely forget that it was winter. The sound of typewriters, the sound of female employees answering the phone, the sound of nibs scratching on white paper... He kept looking at the clock. This day felt like a month to him... During lunch, colleagues were discussing how to spend the evening since it was payday. Those young, single men were talking excitedly, and one of them suddenly asked him:</p>
<h3>The Neighbor's Cough</h3>
<p>— Li Zi</p>
<p>Next door to me lives an old man surnamed Huang.</p>
<p>Every day after I finish work and return home, tired, lying on my bed, I often hear the old man next door making choking coughs. Because there's only a wall separating us, the coughs clearly enter my ears, making me feel very impatient!</p>
<p>As the weather turned cold, the old man's cough increased even more. Sometimes I was awakened in the middle of the night by his coughs, and then I couldn't fall back asleep. I thought this old man must often suffer from colds or lung disease. I found his coughs really unbearable!</p>
<p>But recently, I haven't heard the neighbor's coughs anymore. I've gotten peace and quiet, which is very gratifying. One day, I met the old man, and I asked him the reason for his cessation of coughing. He said, "I am now taking Wuzhou Pharmacy's Breathing Lozenges," a few tablets every day, so my cough has been cured.</p>
<h3>Appreciated by All</h3>
<p>— Wan Zhong</p>
<p>People's precious eyes can appreciate great mountains and rivers, beautiful flowers and plants, and splendid articles… They are the most important object in people's physiology. Therefore, a person with bright eyes is sure to have a limitless future.</p>
<p>But if a person's eyes have pain, he cannot appreciate everything, and everything is abandoned! How unfortunate this is!</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy, which is now devoting itself to the pharmaceutical movement, has specially made "Mingming Eye Drops," a kind of eye drops that extracts elements from domestic Coptis chinensis and Ephedra, and is formulated with zinc salt, boric acid, and other agents. For symptoms such as redness of the eyeballs, swelling and redness of the eyelids, photophobia and tearing, itching and stinging, etc., a drop will immediately show effect, and the bottle style is novel, making it extremely convenient to use. This can truly be said to be a wonderful remedy appreciated by all.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>"What about you? Do you want to come have some fun too?"</p>
<p>He knew that person was inviting him entirely out of good intentions. But all he longed for was his wife and child at home, so he politely declined, saying that he already had another appointment.</p>
<p>At five to five, the salary was delivered to him. He put on his overcoat, preparing to leave. But there was also a letter attached. He didn't open it to take a look… He looked at it, and his hands began to tremble. Had the heat in the office suddenly stopped? He felt cold, and his body also trembled… Colleagues had all left at some point. The tea boy, hunching over, came over and glanced at him with a strange look, asking:</p>
<p>"Why, Mr. × hasn't gone home yet—it's snowing heavily outside."</p>
<p>Yes, it was snowing outside, falling like cotton: falling on the skyscrapers, falling on the bargain flagpoles of department stores, falling on people's hats… The bus stopped at the station for a moment and then drove off. He hadn't jumped on. He kept walking forward, the snowflakes soaking his overcoat and hat, but he didn't feel it. He repeated the letter once, and as he read it, his heart ached as if ants were biting it. He had been working constantly in that office for three years, and now… He didn't understand this world, why it couldn't tolerate someone like him! And he had a wife, a four-year-old child, he couldn't think anymore… He walked past who knows how many silk shops and department stores, but didn't step inside: he had completely fallen into another state.</p>
<p>In that small room, that virtuous wife must be anxiously waiting for his return, because it was getting dark and dinner was ready. But he was wandering the streets like a ghost. On the snowy, cold streets, until late at night.</p>
<p>The snow was falling, falling without stopping...</p>

<p>The Lili Drama Club is the only amateur group. Since its establishment, the club's affairs have been quite developed. It once recruited members, and those who joined were very enthusiastic.

<p>Charles Laughton, the great star known for his leading roles in great masterpieces such as "Les Misérables," "The Old Maid," and "Mutiny on the Bounty," now plays the world-renowned painter Rembrandt in "The Passionate Genius." With his consistent and profound artistic cultivation, every move deeply portrays the posture of an artist who is unkempt and uninterested in fame and fortune. He is also a man of great spirit, unyielding to wealth and power, uncorrupted by riches and honors, purely using his genius skills to express the universe's greatest inspiration in a few strokes of painting. The film is publicly screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater starting today. The director is Alexander Korda, the great director of "The Private Life of Henry VIII."</p>
<h3>Giving Away "Elastic Girl" Songs</h3>
<p>The two songs in the Yi Hua masterpiece "Elastic Girl," namely "Elastic Girl" and "Paired Swallows," the lyrics and music depict the dancers in the metropolis, who are burning with the flames of sin, tasting the deception of love, and enduring the hardships of life. The lyrics are like blood and tears, tactful and moving, and those who love songs, regardless of whether they are local or from other places, can send three cents of postage to the Propaganda Department of Yi Hua Company, and it will be sent to the address immediately.</p>
<h3>Huaan Broadcasting</h3>
<p>Huaan-produced, Lianhua's new film "A Match Made in Heaven" has now been completed by Director Shen Fu, who has supervised the editors and splicers to work day and night. The film is Director Shen Fu's more advanced and humorous masterpiece after "Carefree Gentleman." Those who have watched "Carefree Gentleman" cannot miss "A Match Made in Heaven."</p>
<p>"A Match Made in Heaven" has business significance, social significance, and contemporary significance. It is an unprecedented success for Chinese comedy.</p>
<p>"A Match Made in Heaven" can make you laugh, make you laugh happily; it can also make you shed tears, but it makes you shed tears comfortably. It is a lesson in life that everyone should read, and it is a great tonic for the Chinese masses who are crushed and suffering - vitamin.</p>
<p>The ingredients of "A Match Made in Heaven" are simple but gorgeous, and there is a sense of deep love in the satire. The most precious thing is that it is meaningful and does not just make the audience laugh.</p>
<p>"Spring Comes to the World" has gradually come to an end, and Sun Yu and Situ Huimin are studying the splicing and testing every day in the work of dubbing and splicing.</p>
<p>In "Spring Comes to the World," Chen Yan Yan plays a maid, Xiao Hong. Although she is subjected to the oppression of violent forces like Miss Chen in "The Orphan Girl," her performance is absolutely not the same. Therefore, it can be seen that Yan Yan's skills are extraordinary.</p>
<p>"Spring Comes to the World" is Mei Xi's first feature film to star in Lianhua. He plays a boatman, who transforms into a revolutionary soldier because of his progressive thinking.</p>
<p>There are not many scenes left in "The General's Daughter." It is expected to end this month. Director He Mengfu must give deep consideration to every shot, so every scene is shot very wonderfully and satisfyingly.</p>
<p>In "The General's Daughter," Li Zhuozhuo and Li Qing play a love scene in a large forest. It is natural to talk about love under the towering ancient trees, which is very beautiful. However, the forest is full of ancient tombs, which becomes too humorous to talk about love in the tombs. However, the director's use of the shots is appropriate, and it is impossible to see that it is a tomb, only feeling that it is wonderful.</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Mr. Wang's Way to Wealth"</h3>
