<h3>羅店激戰後我軍完成大包圍形勢</h3>
<p>敵艦集中瀏河今晨將總攻　我有充分凖備决迎頭痛擊</p>
<p>自昨午迄今晨四時止前綫情况如下、㊀楊樹浦江灣閘北方面、我軍陣綫無變動、深夜雙方有劇烈砲戰、㊁張華浜我軍續有進展、殘敵解决不遠、㊂羅店方面激戰頗烈、我軍已完成大包圍形勢、分路向江邊急進、期一鼓解决頑敵㊃集結吳淞口外大批敵艦、昨向瀏河移動、擬集中兵力、今晨下全綫總攻擊令、我已窺破陰謀、敵决難得逞、㊄敵增援軍隊續到、分載運輸艦三艘、駛抵崇明島東、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）敵艦數十艘、由吳淞向瀏河移動、傳今晨拂曉、敵將全綫對我總攻擊、一方面掩護新到增援部隊登陸、同時圖牽制我兵力、解敵在羅店附近之圍、我已有充分準備、防務絕對無慮、</p>
<p>華東社記者、昨晨由陣地歸來、適遇市警察局長蔡勁軍氏、亦自前綫謁張總司令畢返滬、乃於某地訪晤、蔡氏縱談我政府長期抗戰之决心、盼望民衆信任政府、不可自亂陣綫、必須善後策應、方能獲得最後勝利、旋又談及此次羅店之役、我軍奮勇作戰之經過、表示無限傷感、至於吳淞砲台灣獅子林瀏河一帶、已無敵軍、張華浜蘊藻浜略有少數敵踪、當可立卽解决、蔡氏末稱、此次抗戰、我軍士氣旺盛、紛紛以血肉之軀、與敵相拚、至堪欣敬、張華浜等地、初由警察大隊與頑敵週旋、雖死傷過半、但亦聊堪吿慰於國人也云云、</p>
<h3>敵艦移動別有企圖</h3>
<p>敵主力戰擬移瀏河　出雲旗艦來去怱忙</p>
<p>昨午後確訊、吳淞口一帶敵艦、以連日攻我獅子林小川沙羅店等處均被我擊退、受創奇重、頃又改變計劃、今晨各處殘敵、又紛紛返船、大批敵艦、向瀏河轉動、擬將主力戰移至該處、惟此項陰謀、我早已窺破、敵决難得逞也、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）據吳淞方面之確報、吳淞方面停泊之日艦三十八艘、昨日駛離吳淞、向揚子江口獅子林砲台方面移動、察其用意、擬在獅子林方面集合、再以砲火掩護軍隊、再在該處登陸、同時向我羅店嘉定之部隊、欲以砲火威脅、掩護其軍隊前進、因近日敵軍屢攻羅店、皆受挫擊退、按獅子林離羅店約十二三里、</p>
<p>敵旗艦出雲、據楊樹浦方面之報吿、昨晨八時、停泊該處周家嘴浜北口外之浦江中、至昨晨十一時、出雲又自周家嘴江面、駛回上游、在順泰碼頭對江原處停泊、至下午一時、日運輸艦一艘、緊靠出雲、似在搬運物品模樣、直至下午二時半後、該運輸艦才離出雲他去、</p>
<p>中央社云、停泊浦中二號浮筒之敵司令艦出雲號、於昨晨二時忽駛出吳淞口、停泊於獅子林海面、率領停泊該處之敵艦三十餘艘、似又有企圖掩護登陸模樣、迄午始行駛回云、</p>
<p>停泊浦中之敵艦、除於前日一度復增至二十六艘外、昨日起又見减少、蓋現大部敵艦、皆集結於吳淞口外獅子林海面、卽敵司令艦出雲號、亦曾於昨晚一度駛泊該處、現據記者昨日上午調査所得、浦中各艦停泊情形如下、計定海路浦面砲艦一艘、永安紗廠浦面砲艦一艘、蘭路浦面及自來水廠浦面驅逐艦各一艘、浦東新滙山碼頭驅逐艦砲艦各一艘、十號八號浮筒驅逐艦各一艘、六號浮筒砲艦一艘、一號浮筒驅逐艦一艘、再加於昨日十二時駛回泊駐二號浮筒之出雲旗艦、計泊浦中各敵艦共為十三艘、沿途記者僅見招商北棧有敵軍三十餘、三菱碼頭二十餘、餘皆寂然𨶑無一人、</p>
<h3>羅店我軍急進壓迫</h3>
<p>（本報特訊）昨據本報戰地特派員報告、㊀羅店鎮日前經我軍克復後、現先頭部隊已推進至沿江一帶、小川沙口江水滔滔、已可淸晰瞭望、入晚必能到達江口、㊁羅店方面、我軍佈置生力軍迅速挺進、此後敵軍、在該處决無登陸之可能、㊂羅店鎮北尚餘殘敵約二千餘、搆築工事、希圖固守、昨與我軍隔河相持、該處河流迴環、港汶甚多、水深可沒頂、殘敵陣綫、已呈混亂、㊄瀏河獅子林吳淞沿岸、我軍已佈置新陣綫、無論敵如何頑强、足以對付矣、</p>
<p>中央社云、羅店方面昨晨續有激戰、我軍先繞至羅店東面之月浦鎭、取大包圍形勢、在羅店附近之敵、當卽向後退却、我軍奪獲敵方軍械甚多、我軍現已分路向江邊方面急進、期壓迫敵人於江邊而解决之、</p>
<p>中央社據官方消息、羅店方面之敵、業經我軍壓迫至臨江附近、昨日復經月浦方面之駐軍夾擊、受創甚重、敵軍現仍退集徐涇港一帶、已處重重包圍之中、蘊藻浜方面僅留殘敵約三百名、刻仍在繼續肅清之中、至於閘北方面、昨日頗為沉寂云、</p>
<p>張華浜敵軍退江邊</p>
<p>張華浜·蘊藻浜方面之敵、自二十八日晚經我痛擊之後、業已壓迫退至江邊、完全在我軍包圍之中、我軍昨又突出奇兵、繞至江邊、向敵兩翼側擊、敵軍陣綫業已搖動、聞該處最初登陸之敵約為一旅團、現已傷亡過半、集結於張華浜·蘊藻浜兩車站附近、尚圖頑抗、現我軍仍取攻勢、以期殲滅殘敵云、</p>
<h3>吳淞口外目覩記</h3>
<p>偷渡敵船構造簡單　敵機母艦泊崇明島　吳淞鎮上一片焦土</p>
<p>昨有僑胞自海外歸來、道經吳淞、所見口外情形甚詳、向記者報吿、爰記述如下、吳淞口外之敵艦、約計三十餘艘、艦上士兵、一部份正在乘凉休息、一部份則正工作甚忙、大約在搬運軍火、載運士兵偷渡登陸之小船、俱停在大艦之旁、數不可計、此項小船、構造異常簡單、僅木板一方、四圍無邊、板下置有馬達、馬達之聲聲甚微、行駛極快、偷渡之兵、俱平臥於板上、板上可臥四五十人、據同輪到滬之西人談、此種偷渡小船、建造極簡單者、崇明島附近、泊有敵航空母艦二艘、每艘上有飛機約計三四十架、艦上滿堆軍火與糧食、此項食糧、料係漢奸所售與、小輪進口後、祇見吳淞鎭上、一片焦土、楊樹浦以西、瘡痍滿目、殊令人不能不興日本軍人黷武無厭之慨也</p>
<p>虹口敵砲擊我無損</p>
<p>昨日下午虹口方面之敵、以重砲向我江灣陣地猛轟、漫無目標、以致跑馬廳總會旁屋、被中起火、於我軍毫無損害，我方砲隊當卽予以還擊、敵軍虹口司令部附近、被我炸毀殊烈、</p>
<p>楊樹浦我軍前曾將東百老匯路等處突出之陣綫向後撤退、陣容益形鞏固、而敵方徑陸軍補充、雖屢圖反攻、均未得逞、連日我採游擊戰策、屢次進擊岳州路以至東熙華德路及東百老匯路一帶、出沒無常、使敵措手不及、而予以嚴重之打擊、現該處敵軍頗為恐慌，常結集處、堅壘固守、不敢輕舉反攻云、</p>
<p>昨晚江灣砲戰劇烈</p>
<p>（本報特訊）昨晚十一時四十分起，敵以重砲向我江灣陣地轟擊、我軍亦報以重砲、一時砲聲隆隆、劇戰一小時始息、我軍陣地無甚損害、</p>
<p>中央社云、北四川路之敵、連日向我閘北方面數度反攻、均經我軍擊退、迄昨晚止、我軍陣綫並無變動、北站一帶為連日敵軍集中兵力猛攻之地、始終仍在我軍手中、絕無敵踪云、</p>
<p>閘北方面之敵、自前晚以迄昨晨、屢次由青雲橋八字橋方面向我反攻、均經我軍奮勇擊退、昨晨一時左右、敵復向我愛國女學左翼陣地出擊、我軍沉着應戰、以機關槍密集掃射、敵軍傷亡甚重、同時我空軍亦飛至敵方陳地上空轟炸、敵方損害奇重、狼狽不堪、</p>
<p>閘北虹口昨均起火</p>
<p>昨日下午四時至五時、敵機兩隊、共計六架、在閘北寳山路一帶投彈、老靶子路之北遂見火起、延燒甚烈、在浦東上空盤旋之敵機、則未見投彈、</p>
<p>下午一時許、虹口岳州路·黎平路·海勒路·及通州路附近、據報俱有大火、下午四時許、蓬路附近、亦起大火、</p>
<p>敵續到援軍運軍火</p>
<p>確息、敵援軍續有開到、分載運輸艦六艘、昨日駛抵崇明島之東停泊、似在待命進襲中、惟聞該批新到之陸軍、多不慣水性、留居艦中日久、因不勝顛簸之苦、病暈船而不能支持者、為數不少云、</p>
<p>中央社云、昨日下午有敵輪貝發丸及天祥丸二艘、駛入浦江、貝發丸於下午一時、駛靠於二號浮筒之敵司令艦出雲號、於卸去大批軍械彈藥之後、約三時左右、復駛離出雲艦他去、至於天祥丸則停靠於招商局北棧、在該棧有敵軍甚夥、正自輪上起卸彈藥、狀至忙碌、截至五時許、記者離該處時、該批彈藥、尚未起卸完竣也、</p>
<h3>浦東防務異常鞏固</h3>
<p>敵機射擊無抵抗之農民　此種行為實屬違背人道</p>
<p>（本報特訊）今晨本報記者、晤及代表本市某團體專往浦東一帶勞軍甫於昨夜返滬之江君、細述此次浦東方面之戰况頗詳、謹擇其可能披露者記錄於次、以饗關懷浦東方面之讀者、</p>
<p>余（江君自稱）於本月二十四日晨、由滬自高昌廟碼頭買棹渡過浦東、時該處小火車已停駛、乃雇乘士車前進、沿途敵機翱翔不絕、車行十餘里抵某某等處、面晤高級軍事長官、備道來意、某長官等表示感謝、旣向江君聲稱、溯自洪羊之變、浦東方面、尚未罹兵燹、良以浦東一帶、乃係農民及貧苦工人寄托之非武裝區域、初不料頑敵此番寇我淞滬、遭遇意外打擊之後、竟圖轉向浦東方面進犯、是以我軍奉命星夜來此駐防、乃我軍到達之夜、敵艦已猝然向我開釁、我軍報以猛烈之砲擊、經數夜之激戰、敵已喪胆、連日敵方飛機雖常來浦東各地偵察投彈、但毫無效果、而敵軍最使人齒冷者、卽利用飛機時向各小村鎮掃射亳無抵抗之農民、至敵空軍根據地航空母艦之停泊所在、大約係在白龍港方面較遠之海面、蓋常見敵機均在該處升降也、査戰事初起之一星期左右、敵軍曾用巨木排列成行及番布汽艇甚多、確有在南匯等處登陸企圖、但始終未敢輕於嘗試、現我軍防禦、益臻鞏固、敵如來犯、决予痛擊、又據浦東某軍事機關公佈浦東最近概况如下、㊀工事極為鞏固、㊁地方各界已嚴密組織、査拿漢奸、藉免探察軍情、㊂浦東難民、正設法分區收容、俾維治安、以恤民艱、㊃廿六日晚八時敵艦七隻、靠近新三井碼頭、初以機槍掃射、繼有敵二三十名登陸、企圖上岸、經我軍猝予猛擊、敵狼狽遁回、</p>
<p>又昨日午後三時、敵機八架、至浦東一帶偵察、盤旋多時、並擲下三彈、均落於田野內、未受損害、越半小時飛去、至四時半、又來三架、高飛雲際、偵察半小時許、卽行飛去、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）頃有客自南匯來滬、向記者談稱、二十五日上海各報載有敵軍一千二百人、偷渡南匯海灘登岸、被我軍擊潰、生還者僅百人云云、此項消息、實為奇突、因余（客自稱）世居南匯、距城約十五里、沿海一帶、每日有人來往、從未聞有敵軍登陸者、自八·一三戰事爆發後、南匯以地處要衝、防衛甚嚴、早在非常戒備中、連日飛機成羣結隊、至少有二三次、飛經上空、其中以敵機為多、我空軍間亦有之、有時機隊低飛、離地祇二三百尺、滬戰砲聲、淸晰可聞、我軍亦時有過境、秩序極好、軍民融洽、以外別無見聞、此可吿慰於旅外同鄉者、</p>
<p>冒充日機說太滑稽</p>
<p>中央社南京三十日電、日方宣傳謂、有中國購自日本之軍用飛機兩架、漆作日機顏色、並用日機標誌、冒充日機、在黃浦江向日艦投彈等語、中國空軍發言人聞訊、頃予以絕對否認、並認係對中國軍人之一種侮辱、據稱、中國從未向日本購買軍用飛機、且中國空軍、尤不願效日軍之行為、作如此卑劣之舉、或者係日本空軍投擲欠凖、致有如此滑稽之結果云、</p>
<h3>本報記者今晨探得前綫戰况</h3>
<p>敵主力潰退曹王廟北　我軍擊斃敵軍旅團長</p>
<p>本報記者昨晚隨同方·謝·兩聯絡參謀曁王副官等、於八時許、由後方繞道赴羅店方面、晤及在前方指揮作戰□□□高級長官、詳談各路戰况、茲將可以披露者分紀如後、</p>
<p>羅店方面</p>
<p>敵軍由羅店北面石洞口要陸者、約有一師團之衆、係由四十三·四十四·四十七等師團中、抽調精銳部隊所編成之聯隊、戰鬥力頗强、在軍艦飛機掩護之下、向我羅店嘉定之綫突進、企圖衝破嘉定陣地、截斷我軍後路、經我大軍東南西三面大包圍之後、連日來經過數十次之進犯、均被我軍擊退、羅告鎭之爭奪戰尤為激烈、前日（廿九日）敵軍一部向羅店猛烈進攻、事前敵艦集中砲火、會同敵機數十架、向羅店鎭陣地、大施轟炸、我守軍□□□卽在敵軍砲火炸彈下、奮勇抵抗、有進無退、血戰數小時、卒將敵軍擊退、但此役我軍犧牲甚鉅、□□□□□□□□□為國捐軀、悲絕壯絕、當晚我方增厚兵力、大舉反攻、激戰通宵、敵軍卒向西北面狼狽潰退、我軍乘勝追擊、至昨日上午、我軍追至顏家油車地方、敵已潰亂非常、死傷甚衆、被我奪獲機槍·步槍·及背包等甚多、並擊斃敵軍旅團長一名、截獲作戰計劃一紙、截至昨晚十一時止、敵軍右翼之主力部隊、已被我逼退五斗鎮以北羅店方面、西北一帶、尚有一部敵軍、東南為我軍陣地、羅店現雖各佔一半、惟該處敵軍、已被我圍攻兩晝夜、預料當晚（卅日）卽可解决、又昨日上午、敵軍除有一部死守羅店西北一綫外、另派一部主力軍、向我嘉定方面進攻、我軍得報後、卽由□□方面、調動大隊生力軍、向羅店西北面前進、當進至施相公廟附近時、遂發生遭遇戰一次、敵軍知我有備、卽盤據施湘公廟、不敢前進、至下午六時後、我軍以集結火力、向該廟附近敵軍進攻、敵不支而退、我軍當卽奪回施相公廟、並跟蹤追擊、佔領該廟以北之曹王廟、至今晨零時二十分、記者離□□指揮部時、仍在曹王廟以北一帶對峙、</p>
<p>吳淞方面</p>
<p>吳淞方面、自砲台灣以及獅子林一帶、前被偷渡登陸之敵軍、早經我方肅淸、雖有敵艦多艘、在口外不時向我攻擊、飛機時來投彈、企圖再度登陸、但我方戒備嚴密、實屬無隙可乘、故兩日來並無變化、安靜如常、據報、敵軍水上飛機塲、卽在獅子林洋面、</p>
<p>張華浜方面</p>
<p>張華浜尚有敵軍一團、約二千人之譜、仍在泗塘以東各村落固守、並在該處築成據點式工事、且設有鐵絲網等障碍物、但我軍包圍甚密、敵雖屢圖突圍、但終不得逞、又據報、昨日上午敵軍又有一部在張華浜登陸、惟人數不詳、蘊藻浜至吳淞鎮沿浦一帶、尚有少數殘敵、昨晨被我□□部襲擊、敵傷亡甚重、並在浜口被我奪獲鐵板船一艘、</p>
<p>楊樹浦方面</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>中蘇不侵犯條約成立</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>中蘇不侵犯條約於本月二十一日在南京簽字。前晚由我外交部正式發表。這條約發表於舉世戰雲人溯漫。東亞遭受侵略者荼毒的時候。它的最顯明的意義。乃是表示中蘇同為真正愛好和平的偉大民族。我們雖有廣大邊境的接壤卻無絲毫利害的衝突。而在目前侵略者跋扈逞兇的時候。我們相互間也愈益有共同保證和平防阻侵略戰爭的重要責任。</p>
<p>不侵犯條約在本質上的意義是消極的。但其遠大的影響。則是積極的。因為在一方面。這條約保證兩訂約國間的反對戰爭。共維和平。在另一方面。這條約乃是世界和平機構中的一環。它對於國際間集體安全的影響。是至深而且巨的。近年來歐局擾攘。但由於法蘇捷蘇以及其他許多不侵犯條約的訂立。終使國際集髒安全的機構。得以重增力量。而侵略者狼奔豖突的行為。也未致釀成星火燎原的大慘劇。</p>
<p>不過。在說明中蘇不侵犯條約這種積極意義的時候。我們應當鄭重的指出這條約的遠大影響。雖可有助於一般的和平。而其直接的作用。卻决非在對付任何國家。更不致影響我們兩方對於其他各國的原來關係。在近年來日本對我侵略的過程中。一面它對我提出‘共同防共’的要求。企圖以我國供其犧牲。共同進攻蘇聯。另一面則凡我國與英美法蘇任何國家的友誼往來。它必誣指為‘以夷制夷’。認為有碍於它的對我侵略。也許在此次中蘇不侵略條約發表之後。日帝國主義的代表人已在運用其誣蔑離間的慣技。造作種種惡意挑撥的謠言。然而。這種誣蔑的謠言。在今日决非吾人所懼怕。中國願與一切民主和平的國家。保持友好親睦的關係。這是舉世共見的事實。中美之間會訂有友好恊定。中英之間曾成立重要借款。最近我孔財長在歐洲與各國所作之友好往來。足以表示我國的外交政策。為廣泛的和平親睦。决無損害某一國家企圖。只有侵略者則屠刀當前。狼牙在口自絕於我國的和平友好關係耳。</p>
<p>在中蘇之間。我們知道。中國目前的國策是以全力爭取民族的獨立解放。蘇聯目前的國策是以全力從事社會主義的建設。這兩種國策雖因時因地而有不同。但其基本的趨向。為鞏固世界的和平。促使人類的進步。則是完全一致的。近年以來。我國的奮鬥努力。曾為蘇聯所熱烈同情蘇聯的埋頭建設。亦為我國所深切景仰現在因為不侵犯條約的訂立。雙方友好合作的程度又進了一步。我們於慶祝這一外交發展之餘。深望中蘇兩大民族能以此條約的精神為基礎。培植更深厚的友誼。</p>

<h3>英大使傷勢經過良好</h3>
<p>英國駐華大使許閣森遭日機槍擊受傷、入宏恩醫院療治、已歷五日、經主治醫師高特來脫悉心治療、經過甚為良好、據醫院方面消息、英大使之傷勢、危險時期業已脱離、且日有起色、昨日情况更見進步云、</p>
<h3>日機射擊英使案英政府牒日抗議</h3>
<p>提出三項最低限度要求　違背國際公法不容寬宥</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英國駐華大使許閣森爵士、被日本飛機襲擊受傷事、英國政府已於昨日向日本政府提出照會、其內容頃於本日午後五時公佈、結論提出三項要求如下、㊀日本政府應向英國政府正式道歉、㊁日本肇事人員應按照情節輕重加以懲罰、㊂日本當局應提供保證、採取各項必要措置、以免同樣性質事件再度發生、</p>
<p>照會全文</p>
<p>照會首先敘述許閣森大使受傷經過情形、謂此項事故、至可扼腕、英國政府聞訊之餘、不勝痛心、且極憂慮、茲不得不提出堅决抗議、並要求充分補償、‘查經常作戰方式、對於住居關係國境內之非戰鬥員、連外國人在內、足以間接產生受傷之危險、自屬不可避免、但國際法上載有最悠久與最確定之一項規例、卽不論在戰區內外、凡對於非戰鬥員之任何直接或故意的襲擊行為、均在禁止之例、而飛機襲擊、自亦不可視同例外、至於事出偶然一說、亦不能予以接受、蓋各種事實、足以證明日本肇事人員對於普通人民之生命、至少犯漫不經意之咎、而完全置諸度外、總之、此次事件、並非任何經常作戰方式所產生之意外事件、而日本飛機所襲擊者、乃係非戰鬥員、則顯然可見、此在肇事人員理應覺察、</p>
<p>又日本方面所稱汽車旗幟過小、不易見及一說、亦屬不合、蓋卽使汽車未插旗幟、亦無加以襲擊之理由、抑車中乘客之為外國人與外交官、姑置不論、其為非戰鬥員、則係實在之事、茲查日本飛機、當非故意襲擊英國大使、但其確欲襲擊非戰鬥員、則無可置疑、僅以此層而論、已為非法行動矣、</p>
<p>此外又有一事、極須注意、卽許閣森大使所行經之地帶、並無中國軍隊、亦非戰事區域是也、英國政府兹當乘此機會、指出本案尚含有較為重大之意義、蓋此種事故、乃係空軍濫施襲擊之當然結果、而對於戰鬥員與非戰鬥員不分皂白、一律加以襲擊、尤為不合人道之非法行動、又况在目前情况下、戰事狀態之存在、未經中日雙方予以宣佈、或明白予以承認以故日機所為、愈見其無可寬宥矣’云云、（中央社廿九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英牒送達日外部</p>
<p>［東京］英國關於英大使許閣森被日機攻擊事之牒文、今日已由英代辦杜德提交日外相廣田、廣田聲稱、對於此事之英日共同調查、刻正在上海進行中、一俟渠獲知調查結果後、卽當興英代辦接洽云、（中央社二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英駐華大使許閣森被日機射擊受傷一事、日本方面傳來消息稱、英日兩國行將會同調查云云、英官方人士頃宣稱、對於此層並無所知、並謂英當局業已調查完竣、所謂進行調青云者、當係專指日本方面而言云、（中央社三十哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］此間外交界人士頃加以評倫、力謂英致日照會、性質頗為溫和、英國所提出之三項要求、乃屬最低限度、深信東京政府必可予以滿意答復並謂英駐日代辦杜德於送達此項照會時、必曾要求日政府迅速提出復文、並必乘機向日當局再度說明上海公共租界中立化之必要、至於英國所提三項要求、日本是否拒不接受一層、外交界人士並未加以評論、但據私人方面消息、日本若果出此、英國或將召回駐日使節、亦未可必、英國新任駐日大使克萊琪最近首途前往日本履新、現已行抵加拿大、或當等候政府訓令、再賡續登程云、（中央社二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英無意行施報復</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國提交日本關於許閣森大使被攻擊事之抗議文、其措詞曾經熟慮、尚屬溫和、其所提出之要求、眾認為可以履行而不致損及國家之尊嚴、據英國各界人士之意見、日本舉動不愼、致招此抗議、卽此一點、巳可為充分譴責矣、抗議文未言及報復、如日本不接受抗議文中所載之要求、聞英政府不擬續有行動、英人方面、以為日本如果對此要求加以拒絕、則直昭示世界、日本終為不知尊重任何國際道德之國家耳、至於外間所傳英國將要求賠償一節、據英政府之意見、此事關係、至為重大、非可以金錢了結者、如要求賠償、則未免自失尊嚴、抗議文並未限定日政府答覆日期、惟英政府希望覆文可早發出、不致多所廷擱云、（中央社三十日路透電）</p>
<h3>英報論調</h3>
<p>英從大處着想　續為和平努力</p>
<p>［倫敦］倫敦方面報紙、對於英政府向日本提出與英大使許閣森受傷事有關之牒文、極表贊同、泰晤士報稱、牒文之措詞、大眾均認為公正、英政府决不能對於此种‘駭人之暴行、’作較低限度之要求、但倘英政府之要求、較此更為強硬者、則憤恨固有存在之理由、但不應任其控制理智也、今所要求者旣极合情理、希望日本政附能即刻而明白加以滿足、该報復調、‘日本在與中国交往之中、其萬視世界之公法、巳使世界文明机構受有嚴重之損害、日本為偉大之國家、且自有其前程、　　十部分之人民、受狹義之現實所蒙蔽、所見　　　　之事物、但理智比較充分目光較遠之人、必能明瞭日本在有秩序之世界及逐漸建設之文明規則之中、其所得之位置、必較其以武力在無法律世界中所能攫取者、更為豐富也、泰晤士報繼稱、英政府在不犧牲其權利之範圍中、仍將繼續為和平而努力、但目前之問題、關於非戰鬥員之被襲擊、故英政府並不在小處着想、而欲維護基本之原則而使之不致墜廢云、此外晨郵報則謂、全英之輿論均將一致擁護牒文之措詞、此種對於英大使‘深可痛心之襲擊’、巳使英國全境為之震驚、對於此種不可寬恕之行為、决不能更作較此和緩之抗議云、該報繼稱要求之限度固不能再低、且日本政府應不待英政府之要求、而立即給予滿足、今使英政府不得不出於抗議之一途、是　可異者也、長郵報復調、“吾人不信英國之要求、不能在日本發生良好之響應、因日本不應不念及英日間久遠之友誼也、每日捷報則謂、為日本政府着想、應立即接受英政府之要求、而解决此不利於日本之事態、因目前中日间全部事態之變化、已使東京方面至感不怏、日本目前已有糧食缺乏之虞、出口貨物鋭减、國家巳濒於破產云、新聞紀事報論文则謂、英致府牒文所提出之要求、為任何顧全自己體面之負責政府所早應給與者、每日電聞報則稱、該牒文極為嚴整、但措詞則極卑抑、故當然之期望、即日政府應即予以滿足、關於攻擊非戰鬥人員一事、在陸海方面之禁、久已成為眾所承認之原則、但惝此原則不能施及於空軍、則世界之文明勢將有滅絶之懼矣、每日民聲報則謂、方今世界無有力之和平組織、在此英牒文中、即可見其疑懼之一斑、故今後英國之外交政策、應向恢復國聯之途徑進行云、（中央社三十日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本蔑視法律　終必自取滅亡</h3>
<p>［倫敦］孟却斯德指導報今日批評英大使許閣森被攻擊事、調此乃日本在華政策全部之一片、拉丁古語所謂、戰爭一起法律不問者、今乃益信、歐洲與遠東皆不獨在戰時目無法律、即在平時亦復如是、世界眞正無政府党不發現於巴塞洛那與莫斯科、但發現於羅馬東京及其他破壞法律條約與信義之處、英國唯一途徑、在與反對蔑視法律而相信不洗行為終必自取滅亡者、密切聯合而巳云、（中央社三十日路透電）</p>
<h3>莫斯科公布中蘇不侵公約</h3>
<p>認為增進和平又一步驟</p>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇聯外部今日公布中蘇不侵犯條約原文、而不加以評論、路透社訪員遍訪當局、詢以蘇聯援助之查能性、但官傷概不允有所論列、據有資格觀察家之意見、紅軍僅將於外蒙古被攻擊時、始有舉動、因蘇聯對於外蒙、有互助條約之東縛也、蘇聯各界歡迎中蘇不侵犯條約、視此為增進和平之又一步驟、並相信中國不致再反對蘇蒙條約、查蘇聯有特別陸軍永駐遠東、其數約有四五十萬人、在過去數日中、蘇聯曾否多運軍隊與軍需前往還東、則此間尚無所聞、（中央社二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］時報社評、頃就遠東局勢有所闡發、略稱中國與蘇聯所簽訂之不侵犯公約、在此次遠東危局中、除否人所巳知之要素外、並未增加何種新因素、其最可注目者、則此項不侵犯公約之談判、不先不後、適在中日兩國衝突演進之時期、此在東京方面、自不免大為震驚矣雖然、蘇聯干涉中日兩國衝突之一事、大概當可避免、蓋一則就蘇聯國內局勢而論、莫斯科政府無從事戰爭之可能、二則蘇聯外交、在歐洲方面頗為活躍、反之、在遠東方面則始終採取保留態度也、云云、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日封鎖我海岸問題</h3>
<p>外務省發言人　答外記者質疑</p>
<p>［東京］二十七日各國記者對於遮斷航行問題、提出五點質疑、三十日午外務省發言人已答復、問答如下、‘第一問’平和的通商是何意義、依船籍而言乎、抑係貨主國籍而言乎、答係指依第三國船舶所載之平和通商而言、‘第二問’善意船舶或惡意船舶是何意義、答對於華船無認為善意之餘地、對第三國一般的不認為有惡意、‘第三問’對惡意船舶將採如何措置、答按照遮斷交通措置之目的、無濫行沒收船舶及貨物之意思、不越目衛手段範圍、‘第四問’華船如偽稱英或其牠外國籍懸掛外國旗時、將採如何措置、答華船如偽稱其他國籍、懸掛第三國旗時、當然不能免交通遮斷之措置、‘第五問’日對非平和的通商、將如何停止之乎答因每個塲合而異、惟尊重第三國之平平和通商、（三十日中央社）</p>
<h3>法報主張飛機供給中國</h3>

<h3>淞口一帶難謀進展敵軍今晨又猛攻閘北</h3>
<p>經我迎頭痛擊敵倉惶退走　羅店西北敵營被我軍佔領　敵反攻曹王廟雙方有惡戰　張華浜敵軍陣地發生動搖</p>
<p>今晨敵軍猛攻閘北</p>
<p>砲火兵力集中北站　當經我軍奮勇擊退</p>
<p>據今晨所得前方之報告、羅店方面之敵、在徐涇港一帶隔河與我對峙、雖仍負隅頑抗、然已處我軍包圍之中、消滅之期、當不在遠矣、張華浜江邊之殘敵、刻仍在繼續肅淸中、北四川路之敵、今晨黎明之前、曾向我閘北方面猛力進攻、並集中砲火及兵力於北站一帶、當經我軍奮勇擊退、敵軍傷亡奇重、倉惶退走、</p>
<p>昨晚十一時廿分起、浦江敵艦及楊樹浦敵軍砲隊、向海軍操塲及江灣路等處我軍陳地猛攻、掩護天通菴及八字橋敵軍、向我閘北八字橋及愛國女校方面反攻、我軍勇奮還擊、同時我□□□方面砲兵、亦以野砲向敵軍陣地猛轟、敵軍衝鋒幾次、均被我擊退、故至今晨止、其間雙方大砲與機關槍聲、聯續不斷、竟達六七小時之久、激戰之烈、可見一般、</p>
<p>羅店西北敵軍潰退</p>
<p>今晨我佔領敵軍駐紮地　敵潰退北面五斗鎮一帶</p>
<p>今晨據某軍事機關由羅店方面返滬之聯絡員稱、我軍於昨日午夜開始向羅店鎮西北面之敵軍、三面圍攻、浴血進撲、敵軍倉皇應戰、頑抗多時、卒以後方應援不及、向北面五斗鎮一帶潰退、死傷甚衆、我軍乘勝追擊、於今晨拂曉時、在西北某地佔領敵軍類似司令部之營地、奪獲戰利品不少、於此可見敵軍潰退時之狼狽矣、</p>
<p>敵今晨反攻曹王廟</p>
<p>我以大砲及機關槍壓迫　截至今晨十時尚在惡戰</p>
<p>確息、由羅店西北方企圖向我嘉定綫突進之敵軍主力部隊、被我大軍擊退曹王廟以北一帶後、今晨拂曉時、敵軍又集軍艦砲火、出動大批飛機、以立體式開始向我□□□□陣地猛轟、陸上部隊、亦同時向曹王廟施相公廟一帶反攻、我軍沉着應戰、□□方面之砲兵陣地、亦以大砲及機關槍還擊、壓迫敵軍前進、截至今日上午十時止、尚在惡戰中、</p>
<p>張華浜敵反攻失敗</p>
<p>被我軍迎頭痛擊敵又潰退　我今晨乘勝追擊獲有進展</p>
<p>張華浜方面殘敵二千左右、盤據泗塘以東各村落、設有鐵絲網等防禦工事、臨險負嵎、昨晨（三十日）又有一小部份敵軍上陸、整頓隊伍、希圖破我重圍、我軍兵力雄厚、予以迎頭痛擊、雙方砲火密集、肉搏良久、敵軍不支潰退、損失重大、</p>
<p>又據另一報告昨日午夜至今晨（三十一日）、張華浜我軍、復繼續向敵軍陣地推進、乘勝追擊、我砲兵亦對準標目、猛力轟擊、敵軍陣地動搖、軍心紊亂、狼狽後竄、我方又獲有相當進展、</p>
<p>我軍飛機今晨偵察</p>
<p>飛翔虹口及浦江上空　浦面日艦均倉皇失措</p>
<p>今晨三時許、我國飛機數架、又飛至虹口區域及浦江上空一帶偵察、泊於該處浦面日艦十餘艘、倉皇以高射砲及機關槍向空亂放並用探海燈向空際照射、一時十餘道白光、在空際擺動、但我機並未投彈、於任務完畢之後、卽行飛去、</p>
<p>今晨二時至三時間、我空軍大隊、曾在滬東楊樹浦一帶敵軍陳地上實施轟炸、投彈數枚、切中標的、敵軍確受相當損傷、同時在吳淞空際與敵機發生遭遇戰、我空軍威武勇敢、身手矯捷、當時有數敵機被我壓迫降落浦面、至三時零五分敵機全部敗退、我空軍方始整隊而歸、是役吳淞敵軍後方亦曾被我空軍重創、</p>
<p>工部局所得之情報</p>
<p>西區及黃浦江一帶平靖　楊樹浦區曾中流彈多枚</p>
<p>工部局消息、自昨日（三十日）下午六時至今日（三十一日）上午十時、西區及黃浦江一帶、均甚平靖、惟北區戰事甚為劇烈、據楊樹浦區報告、今日上午二時四十五分至上午三時零五分時、租界內曾中流彈多枚、在匯司虹口區、今晨六時四十分、有砲彈在愛而近路菜塲附近爆炸、該菜塲房屋被炸毀、並有三人受傷、傷情不明、</p>
<p>今日侵晨、蘇州河以北各捕房之報告、均為“一切平靖、並無人受傷”、</p>
<p>今日上午六時至八時、有日本軍用飛機四架、飛經上海區域、大約係舉行偵察、</p>
<p>上午八時至十時、頗為安靜、惟據報閘北廣肇山莊附近、砲彈頻墮、靠近公共租界邊界之周家嘴路一帶、有數處起火焚燒、</p>
<p>東區敵軍調動甚繁</p>
<p>大阪等碼頭集結最多</p>
<p>據頃自楊樹浦乘輪來滬之某公司職員稱、滬東區敵軍根據地定海橋一帶、該處敵軍、日來調動某繁、似有援軍加入、惟是否有敵正規軍參加、無從證明、現楊樹浦敵軍集結最多之處、有大阪黃浦三菱等碼頭、惟匯山碼頭、則僅少數敵軍駐紮、</p>
<p>敵機無人道之行為</p>
<p>轟炸難民及傷兵等　二百餘人全歸於盡</p>
<p>昨日上午十時許、有由戰區救護出險之難民及傷兵約二百餘人、停留於楊行鎮之長途汽東站、是時忽來敵機一隊、在空中盤旋數匝、突投炸彈十餘枚、此流離失所之難民及轉側沉吟之傷兵二百餘人、無法逃避、全歸於盡、敵機之屢次轟炸難民及傷兵、慘無人道、可謂達於極點矣、</p>
<p>潰退敵軍情狀狼狽</p>
<p>槍械制服均已丟去　身上穿汗衫與短軍褲</p>
<p>據某外輪公司拖駁輪船員談、昨晨八時、因公駛往楊樹浦、歸途在虹口招商中棧、目見日方敗退之兵士數卡車、由前方載回、該項兵士、槍械制服、均已丟去、身上僅穿汗衫小短軍褲、狼狽之狀、不可言喻、</p>
<p>日軍砲手無的放矢</p>
<p>射至戰區外數十里　僅轟燬房屋未傷人</p>
<p>日軍　手、幼稚異常、每為無的放矢、前晚竟對浦東方面非戰鬥區域濫施射擊、致砲彈將滬　圈吳珠生家房屋兩間擊毀、又將塘橋陳旗橋村海龍家房屋兩間擊毀、因連日鄕民、均已逃亡、故未傷一人、但以上兩處、離戰區有數十里之遙、則可證日方之搗亂、斑也、</p>
<p>敵方彈藥源源運滬</p>
<p>自敵方運輸輪貝發丸天祥丸二艘於昨日抵滬、運來大批彈藥後、昨晚續有上海丸一艘駛進淞口、現泊大阪碼頭、據記者今日上午調查所得、該輪於昨晚起卽開始起卸彈藥、載至本日上午十時左右、尚仍有敵軍三四十人、在繼續起卸、甚為忙碌、</p>
<p>各外輪已準備復航</p>
<p>太古盛京輪恢復華北綫　英商馬勒輪載難民赴甬</p>
<p>戰事盡心外移後、本埠情勢、稍形安定、各外輸公司已紛紛凖備復航、今晨七時、太古公司法租界碼頭及浦東華通與公司兩碼頭、同時恢復工作、浦東賈家角藍烟囪太古公司亦開始出貨、又太古盛京輪船於昨晨進口後、已定今日午後出口、恢復華北班航線、英商馬勒公司商輪一艘、今日上午十時、在招商局金利源碼頭、載運寗波同鄕會所收容之難民二千餘人返甬、聞英商恰和公司亦擬籌備各輪復航、但以該公司碼頭與貨棧、同處虹口戰區、旅客與貨物上下、均感不便、故進行頗感困難、至浦東方面各廠棧、僅陸家嘴頤中烟廠一家、以各地缺貨、需要大量捲烟、故亦於今晨開始出貨、其他各廠、尚無動靜、</p>
<h3>日機襲擊廣州被我擊落兩架</h3>
<p>參加襲擊者日機七架　兩敵機在虎門被擊落</p>
<p>［廣州］今晨日機第一次襲擊廣州、據與中國空軍方面有關係者言參加襲擊者、計有日機七架、向軍用飛機塲附近之內河砲兵陣地、擲落炸彈二枚云，又據沙面某外人目覩者云、渠曾見飛機六架、飛行於一萬六千呎之高度、當淸晨六時、敵機被　　　　　　放砲鳴鑼示　　　　　　言人稱、日本　　　　　　逃逸時、為中國飛機所追及、旋於虎門砲台、擊落敵機兩架云、（中央社三十一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>我向國聯提出照會詳述日本侵略經過</h3>
<p>日軍違反條約攻擊中國城市　竭力破壞我十年來建設事業</p>
<p>［日內瓦］中國駐瑞士公使胡世澤博士、頃於本日午後、以照會一件送達國聯會秘書處、詳述七月七日蘆溝橋事件發生以來、中日兩國衝突經過、此間一般人以為此乃中國向國聯會提出申訴之先聲、照會內容首述中國政府素抱妥恊態度、除履行各項恊定外、並向日本一再提議中止戰事、但因日本蓄意侵略、力事擴大、以致勞而無功、其結論共分四節、大要如下、</p>
<p>“㊀日本軍隊侵入中國領土、並用陸海空軍在中國北部與中部襲擊中國城市、此乃純粹侵略行動、已屬亳無疑義、</p>
<p>㊁中國雖用盡各種方法、防止暴力侵略、均歸失敗、迫不獲已、惟有實行抗戰、此乃中國行使當然的自衛權、</p>
<p>㊂日本侵略中國原係抱有預定計劃、此項計劃、自一九三一年九一八事變首開其端、迄今仍在賡續實行中、日本雖一再聲明、對於中國並無領土野心、但已佔領平津一帶、並决定進佔整個華北、藉以控制中國其他部份、觀於中國自十年來所慘淡經營之建設事業、日本均竭力加以破壞、可以見之矣、</p>
<p>㊃現行各種國際條約、日本業已一一予以違反、例如該國蓄意破壞遠東和平、此乃違反國聯會盟約所載各項基本原則、該國利用戰爭以遂行國策、並不屑用和平辦法解决國際爭端、此乃違反一九二七年非戰公約、該國不知尊重中國主權獨立與領土完整、此乃違反一九二二年九國公約、”</p>
<p>中國政府最後並要求、以上述各項事實、通知國聯會各會員國、與一九三四年二月廿四日因中國東三省事件所設置之諮詢委員會各會員國（美國亦在其內）云、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［日內瓦］中國政府頃向國聯會提出照會、指責日本蓄意侵略之後、國聯會人士頃加以評論、謂此乃中國向國聯會正式提出申訴之先聲、中國政府照會雖未要求以中日兩國爭端列入國聯會大會下屆常會（九月十三日開會）議事日程之內、但中國乃行政院半常任理事、儘可在行政院或國聯會大會開會期內、依據盟約第十七條規定、提出申訴云、按盟約第十七條載明、國聯會會員國與一非會員國發生爭議時、應邀請非會員國承認會員國義務、而照行政院所認為正當之條件、解决爭議、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>中蘇訂不侵犯條約德國並不驚異</h3>
<p>認為我國安全辦法　蘇俄報紙一致擁護</p>
<p>［柏林］此間政界對於中蘇二國簽訂不侵犯條約、並不表示興奮、而以客觀之態度加以判斷、雖一部分人士憂慮中國此後或將感受布爾希維克之影響、然另一方面以為、蔣介石將軍及中國政府、會積極實行反共政策、將來可望其獨立性、不受共黨黨之影響、以故德國政界對於中蘇不侵犯絛約、有視為安全辦法之傾向、以為中國政府之目的、在免除有害於中國為和平而奮鬥之糾紛、並使中國有動員全國防衛力量之可能、此間鄭重聲明、就此項觀點而言則中國政府、决定締結中蘇不侵犯條約、固不必驚異也、（三十日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］關于中蘇訂立不侵犯條約事、此間消息報稱之爲蘇聯不受和平政策之又一表現、該報繼續詳論和平不可分割之原則、眞理報之論𧪓、與上述者大致相同、并稱該條約之訂立、足以證明蘇聯民族對於中國民族之為自由獨立而奮鬥、極抱好感、而條約之本身、則爲和平及集體保障之新工具之代表云、（中央社三十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>德國並不借款與日本</h3>
<p>［柏林］此間消息靈通方面聲稱、某通訊社發表之報告、謂德國自願蔣鉅額借款貸與日本、作爲購買軍需品之用云云、與事實並不符合、此間鄭重聲稱、德國亦無於將來採取此項步驟之意向云、（三十日國民海通電）</p>
<h3>平漢綫連日劇戰敵陣地已動搖</h3>
<p>我便衣隊抵長辛店站　良鄉城被圍即可收復</p>

<h3>粵無照僑民驅逐出境</h3>
<p>［廣州］兩廣外交特派員公署三十日正式通告領事、凡外僑居留及入境均須有護照、其無護照及無國籍人民、一律驅逐出境、以杜匪徒活動、及保護外僑安全、（三十日中央社電）</p>
<h3>敵機襲徐州</h3>
<p>［徐州］三十晚六時半、敵機六架、飛徐襲擊投彈十餘、（三十日專電）</p>
<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>滬戰發生後。敵人慘無人道之舉動。旣屬筆不勝書。而所最難忍者。莫過於到處飛機襲擊無辜良民。卽如英大馬路先施公司之被炸。與南車站之被炸。無辜良民之慘被死傷者不下千餘人。此外英大使之被襲擊。紅十字會救護員之被殘殺。實為野蠻民族之一種殘酷行為。决非自許文明國家所應出此。故某西報謂。“日人如此暴行。而近衛謂須將中國繫至屈膝。徒增抗日精神與全球與情之憤憾而已。”誠如斯言。日本今欲將中國繫至屈膝。請休想再作此種酣睡中之迷夢。</p>

<h3>抗戰聲中後方情緒的一斑（二）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員賡雅</p>
<p>亡了國以後</p>
<p>當一個國家民族，不幸因强國大兵壓境，一步緊一步的，受到迫害的時候，全國官民倘若還不振臂一呼，大家起來，擔負着數千年祖宗交給我們的責任，擔負着億萬年子孫仰望我們的責任，抱定生死不變的决心，出百死以爭取生存，那未遭逢亡國慘禍以後，要挽回尼運是十分困難的。因為近代亡人之國，滅人之族的工具，實在太毒辣了。我擧一件小小的例證罷。</p>
<p>有一天，在昆明　湖的草地上，看見兩個穿鱉脚西裝的中年男子，從蒋委員長西安半月記的某段話中，探索中國此次能否眞正抗戰的意義。兩人各持正反一面的理由，辯論相持不下。初聽他們的語調，疑是廣東人，俟和他們攀談後，才知道是安南的國民黨。</p>
<p>當中的一個對我說：他曾參與“安拜”起事，失敗逃至雲南，不料忽被彼族「漢奸」，把他和其他同志數人，設計就縛，藏於貨箱中，山滇越鐵路解回安南。幸中途被海關査出釋放，差點兒幾乎悶死箱中。</p>
<p>他繼述：前數月安南總督（法人）某氏，到昆明訪問雲南當局。他們這一羣可憐蟲，又突然被警察局拘禁了一回。據說，誌局因㣘法人之談，怕他們去暗殺總督，遺禍東道啊！果爾事實如此，則彼等精神上所受的痛苦，當更勝於拘禁的千百倍，否則受此「无妄之災」，亦是「冤　枉也」。</p>
<p>最後臨別時，他們握緊我的手說：「朋友！不努力救國於未亡之先，而妄想復國於旣亡之後，確是一　翻山倒海的萬難事！自恨研究漢文未通，不能詳書此意，以正告國難當前，尚有抗戰機會的祖國同胞也！一語重心長，同病相憐的國人聞之·能無動於衷乎？</p>
<p>民族革命者</p>
<p>滇西騰越某鄕村，蟄居着一位年近古稀的「民族革命者」，他是緬甸的皇太子，名呌「疆括」。假若緬甸還未亡國的話，他當然是承繼正統，榮登大寶之人。但毫不留情的現實環境，已宣佈他是亡國慘史中的可歌可泣之主角了。</p>
<p>當英人於一八二三年開始侵略緬甸的時候，一般特殊階級的緬人，未嘗不感覺到民族命運的黯澹，但是震於英人的强势，對於一切苛求，都悮以「半推半就」的態度去應付。後來看着情势太不好了，才脚慌手亂地集结大軍，實行抗戰，可惜「大勢已去」，無濟於事，至一八八六年（距開始侵略時六十三年），卒被英國所滅。</p>
<p>「疆括」便是在「大勢已去」之徒，猶毅然决然，事兵抗議的犧牲者。他這番「知不可爲而爲」的抗戰精神，姑終是值得我們敬佩的。他現在是靠行醫及務農，解決生活問題，他的年事，雖不無落場餘暉之惑，可是他的復國思想，並不消沉，秘密策進的復國運動，也從未間斷，以故，他在此流亡四十幾年的長期中，常博得人們精神上物質上的同情和援助。</p>
<p>我們當此國難期間，看了止述「疆括」的小史，至少可以得到三種敎訓：㊀國家遇外力侵略時，只存退讓茍安的心理，而不早不抗戰的决心，必是亡國之兆。㊁敵人施用逐步蠶食的政策，正我坐受凌遲碎割的毒刑，莫謂　皮　臠可忍痛，須知緊接着就是迎心之　。㊂抗戰救亡的民族英雄，後　縱至失敗，也必博得無限的同情心。</p>
<h3>南口戰况激烈</h3>

<p>長城各口戰况</p>
<p>據崔氏又談、沿長城各耍口本（上三）日戰况、大致如下、㊀神威台方面、午刻有敌便衣隊七十餘人、戰車二輛鐵甲車三輛、飛機三架、其目的似在偵察我軍陣地情形、首由敵便衣隊發槍向我射擊戰車鐵甲車飛機同時輔助作戰、向我陣地猛衝、當經我軍沉着应戰迄下午二時、敵始不支向後退却、敵機曾投下七彈、均於我無損、㊁新開地方、下午二時、有敵騎砲兵詐稱二千餘人、實備五六百人、與我砲戰甚久、迄晚亦經我擊退、㊂下午二時、漢諾爾壩以西灰菜樑·大紅溝·一帶、有敵迫擊砲一連、山砲一連、步兵一百三十餘人、亦詐稱爲一千人、向我衝進、我守兵意志堅决、沉着應戰、敵亦未得逞、仍向後潰退、㊃洗馬林西北方面、有大部敵軍、其目的係擬向大紅溝突越我洗馬林陣地、佔據柴溝堡、切斷察綏聯絡、我方已有準備定可無虞、又據軍息、沿長城各口、西起神威台、東至赤城縣迤東之太子城一帶、多有接觸、十三日夜十一時許有敵軍數百、裝甲汽車二十餘輛、迭向我神威台右側大紅溝灰菜梁陣地、先後猛衝四次、經我軍沉着應付、均未得逞迄至十四日早時許、敵又以同等兵力捲土重來、其勢兇兇亦被我軍迎頭擊潰、同夜靑邊口、東北之三間房、亦有敵數十名裝甲汽車一輛、另携大砲一門、進犯我陣地、亦被擊退、獨石口塘子口一帶、同夜亦發現敵兵八十餘人、向我進犯、經我軍出擊、敵始而頑抗終至不支、紛向後逃、這我軍進巴圖營地方、敵即急登預備之汽東飛馳逃逸又在我赤城縣以東、太子城附近敵軍增加一團、擬即向我進犯、</p>

<h3>After Fierce Battle at Luodian, Our Troops Complete Grand Encirclement</h3>
<p>Enemy Ships Concentrated at Liuhe; General Attack Expected This Morning – We Are Fully Prepared and Resolved to Meet Them Head-On with a Painful Blow</p>
<p>From yesterday afternoon until 4:00 AM this morning, the situation on the front lines is as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ In the Yangshupu, Jiangwan, and Zhabei areas, our military lines remained unchanged. There was intense artillery fire between the two sides late at night.</p>
<p>㊁ At Zhanghuabang, our troops continue to make progress, and the remaining enemy forces will soon be resolved.</p>
<p>㊂ In the Luodian area, fierce fighting has been intense, and our troops have completed a grand encirclement, advancing rapidly towards the riverbank in separate routes, aiming to resolve the stubborn enemy in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>㊃ A large number of enemy ships gathered outside Wusongkou yesterday moved towards Liuhe, intending to concentrate their forces and issue a general attack order across the entire line this morning. We have seen through their conspiracy, and the enemy will definitely not succeed.</p>
<p>㊄ Enemy reinforcements continue to arrive, transported on three transport ships, and have arrived east of Chongming Island.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Dozens of enemy ships have moved from Wusong towards Liuhe. It is rumored that at dawn this morning, the enemy will launch a general attack on our entire line, on one hand, to cover the landing of newly arrived reinforcements, and on the other hand, to attempt to contain our forces and relieve the enemy forces surrounded near Luodian. We are fully prepared, and there is absolutely no need to worry about defenses.</p>
<p>A reporter from the East China News Agency returned from the front lines yesterday morning and happened to meet Cai Jinjun, the Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, who had also returned to Shanghai after visiting Commander-in-Chief Zhang from the front lines. They met at a certain location, where Cai Jinjun spoke at length about the government's determination to wage a long-term war of resistance, expressing hope that the public would trust the government and not disrupt their own ranks. He emphasized the need for good follow-up support to achieve final victory. He then discussed the battle of Luodian, expressing deep emotion about the courageous fighting of our troops. He stated that there were no enemy troops in the Wusong, Paotaiwan, Shizilin, and Liuhe areas. There were only a few enemy traces in Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang, which could be resolved immediately. Cai Jinjun concluded by saying that the morale of our troops was high in this war of resistance, and they were all fighting the enemy with their blood and flesh, which was truly admirable. In Zhanghuabang and other places, the police brigade initially engaged with the stubborn enemy, and although they suffered more than half casualties, it was comforting to the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships' Movements Suggest Other Intentions</h3>
<p>Enemy Main Force Plans to Move Battle to Liuhe – Izumo Flagship Hurriedly Comes and Goes</p>
<p>Confirmed information yesterday afternoon indicates that the enemy ships in the Wusongkou area, after repeated attacks on our Shizilin, Xiaochuansha, and Luodian, were repelled and suffered heavy damage. They have now changed their plan, and this morning, the remaining enemy troops from various locations have returned to their ships. A large number of enemy ships are moving towards Liuhe, planning to shift the main battle to that location. However, we have already seen through this conspiracy, and the enemy will definitely not succeed.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) According to reliable reports from the Wusong area, 38 Japanese warships anchored in Wusong sailed away from Wusong yesterday, moving towards the Yangtze River estuary and the Shizilin Fort area. Their intention seems to be to gather at Shizilin and then use artillery fire to cover the landing of troops there, while simultaneously threatening our troops in Luodian and Jiading with artillery fire to cover their troops' advance. This is because the enemy has repeatedly attacked Luodian recently and been defeated. Shizilin is approximately twelve to thirteen miles from Luodian.</p>
<p>Regarding the enemy flagship Izumo, reports from Yangshupu indicate that at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, it was anchored in the Huangpu River outside the Zhoujiazuibang Beikou area. At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, the Izumo sailed from the Zhoujiazuibang river surface back upstream and anchored across from the Shuntai Wharf. At 1:00 PM, a Japanese transport ship came close to the Izumo, seemingly to move goods. The transport ship only left the Izumo at around 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the enemy command ship Izumo, anchored at buoy number two in the Huangpu River, suddenly sailed out of Wusongkou at 2:00 AM yesterday morning and anchored in the Shizilin sea area, leading more than 30 enemy ships anchored there, seemingly intending to cover a landing. It sailed back at noon.</p>
<p>The enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River, in addition to increasing to 26 ships the day before, have decreased again yesterday. Most of the enemy ships are now concentrated in the Shizilin sea area outside Wusongkou. Even the enemy command ship Izumo once sailed to that location last night. According to an investigation by reporters yesterday morning, the anchoring situation of the ships in the Huangpu River is as follows: one gunboat on the Dinghai Road river surface, one gunboat on the Yong'an Yarn Factory river surface, one destroyer each on the Lanlu Road river surface and the Waterworks river surface, one destroyer and one gunboat each at the Pudong Xinhuishan Wharf, one destroyer each at buoys number ten and eight, one gunboat at buoy number six, and one destroyer at buoy number one. Adding the Izumo flagship, which sailed back to anchor at buoy number two at 12:00 PM yesterday, there are a total of thirteen enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River. Along the way, reporters only saw more than 30 enemy soldiers at the Zhaoshang Beizhan and more than 20 at the Mitsubishi Wharf. Everyone else was quiet and deserted.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Rapidly Advance and Pressure Luodian</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) According to a report from our newspaper's war correspondent yesterday:</p>
<p>㊀ After our troops recaptured Luodian Town a few days ago, the vanguard has now advanced to the coastal area. The flowing river water at Xiaochuanshakou can be clearly seen, and they will definitely reach the river mouth by nightfall.</p>
<p>㊁ In the Luodian area, our troops are deploying fresh troops for a swift advance. From now on, enemy troops will definitely not be able to land there.</p>
<p>㊂ There are still approximately 2,000 remaining enemy troops north of Luodian Town, constructing fortifications in an attempt to hold on. Yesterday, they confronted our troops across the river. The rivers in that area meander, with many harbors and creeks. The water is deep enough to drown someone. The enemy lines are already in disarray.</p>
<p>㊄ Our troops have deployed new lines of defense along the coasts of Liuhe, Shizilin, and Wusong. No matter how stubborn the enemy is, we are well-equipped to deal with them.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that fierce fighting continued in the Luodian area yesterday morning. Our troops first circled around to Yuepu Town, east of Luodian, to form a grand encirclement. The enemy near Luodian immediately retreated, and our troops captured many enemy military supplies. Our troops are now advancing rapidly along separate routes towards the riverbank, aiming to pressure the enemy to the riverbank and resolve them there.</p>
<p>According to official sources from the Central News Agency, the enemy in the Luodian area has been pressured by our troops to the vicinity of the river. Yesterday, they were also attacked from both sides by troops stationed in the Yuepu area and suffered heavy losses. The enemy troops are now retreating to the Xujinggang area, where they are heavily surrounded. Only about 300 remaining enemy troops are left in the Yunzaobang area, and they are still being cleared out. As for the Zhabei area, it was relatively quiet yesterday.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops at Zhanghuabang Retreat to the Riverbank</p>
<p>After being fiercely attacked by our troops on the evening of the 28th, the enemy in the Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang areas have been pressured to retreat to the riverbank and are completely surrounded by our troops. Yesterday, our troops launched a surprise attack, circling around to the riverbank and attacking the enemy flanks from both sides. The enemy lines have already wavered. It is reported that the enemy troops who initially landed there consisted of about one brigade, and more than half have now been killed or wounded. They are gathered near the Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang stations, still attempting to resist stubbornly. Our troops are still on the offensive, aiming to annihilate the remaining enemy.</p>
<h3>Eyewitness Account Outside Wusongkou</h3>
<p>Enemy Raiding Boats Have Simple Construction – Enemy Aircraft Carrier Anchored off Chongming Island – Wusong Town a Scorched Earth</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Chinese citizen returned from overseas and passed through Wusong. He reported the situation outside the harbor in great detail to reporters. The following is a record of his report. There were about thirty enemy ships outside Wusongkou. Some of the soldiers on the ships were relaxing and resting, while others were busy working, mainly transporting munitions. Small boats for carrying soldiers on stealthy landing were parked beside the large ships. These small boats had a very simple construction, with just wooden planks. They had no edges on the four sides, and had a motor underneath the plank. The sound of the motor was very quiet and the speed very fast. The raiding soldiers all lay flat on the board, which could carry forty or fifty people. A Westerner on the same boat to Shanghai said that the extremely simple construction of such raiding boats means that the construction costs are very low. Near Chongming Island, there were two enemy aircraft carriers anchored, each with about thirty to forty aircraft. The ships were piled high with munitions and food, which it is expected that local collaborators sold to them. After the small boat entered the harbor, the Wusong area was completely scorched earth. The areas west of Yangshupu were scarred and wounded, which could not but cause a sense of resentment towards the insatiable ambition of the Japanese military.</p>
<p>Enemy Artillery Fire in Hongkou Does No Damage</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the enemy in the Hongkou area bombarded our Jiangwan positions with heavy artillery, aimlessly. As a result, the building next to the Racecourse General Association caught fire, but it caused no damage to our troops. Our artillery units immediately retaliated, and the area near the enemy's Hongkou headquarters was severely damaged by our bombing.</p>
<p>Our troops in Yangshupu previously retreated from the protruding defense lines at Dong Broadway and other places, making the defense more solid. However, even with the Japanese army adding reinforcements, they have repeatedly failed to counterattack. In recent days, we have adopted guerrilla tactics, repeatedly attacking the Yuezhou Road, Dong Xihuaide Road and Dong Broadway areas, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, giving the enemy a severe blow while making them caught off guard. The enemy troops in that area are now quite panicked, often gathering in strongholds and fortifications, afraid to launch a counterattack lightly.</p>
<p>Intense Artillery Fire at Jiangwan Last Night</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Starting at 11:40 PM last night, the enemy bombarded our Jiangwan positions with heavy artillery. Our troops retaliated with heavy artillery, and for a time, the sound of artillery fire roared, with intense fighting lasting for an hour before subsiding. Our positions suffered little damage.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the enemy on North Sichuan Road has launched several counterattacks towards our Zhabei area in recent days, but all have been repelled by our troops. As of last night, our defense lines have not changed. The North Station area has been the site of intense attacks by concentrated enemy forces for days, but it remains in our hands, with no enemy presence.</p>
<p>From the night before last until yesterday morning, the enemy in the Zhabei area repeatedly launched counterattacks from the Qingyun Bridge and Bazibao area, but were all bravely repelled by our troops. At around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy launched an attack on the left flank of our Patriotic Girls' School position. Our troops responded calmly, using machine guns for intensive strafing. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. At the same time, our air force also flew to the skies above the enemy's positions and bombed them, causing extremely heavy damage to the enemy, who were in a terrible state.</p>
<p>Fires in Zhabei and Hongkou Yesterday</p>
<p>From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM yesterday, two teams of enemy aircraft, a total of six, dropped bombs in the Baoshan Road area of Zhabei. A fire broke out north of the Laobazi Road and spread rapidly. Enemy aircraft circling over Pudong did not drop any bombs.</p>
<p>At around 1:00 PM, reports indicated that there were major fires in the Yuezhou Road, Liping Road, Hailer Road, and Tongzhou Road areas of Hongkou. At around 4:00 PM, a major fire also broke out in the Pengpu Road area.</p>
<p>Enemy Reinforcements Continue to Arrive and Transport Munitions</p>
<p>Confirmed reports indicate that enemy reinforcements continue to arrive, transported on six transport ships, which arrived east of Chongming Island yesterday and are anchored, seemingly waiting for orders to advance. However, it is reported that many of the newly arrived ground troops are not accustomed to the water and have been staying on the ships for a long time. Many of them have been suffering from seasickness and cannot endure the hardship.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that two enemy ships, the Beifa Maru and the Tianxiang Maru, sailed into the Huangpu River yesterday. The Beifa Maru docked at the enemy command ship Izumo at buoy number two at 1:00 PM and, after unloading a large quantity of munitions, sailed away from the Izumo at around 3:00 PM. The Tianxiang Maru docked at the Zhaoshangju North Wharf, where there were many enemy soldiers unloading munitions from the ship. The situation was very busy. As of 5:00 PM, when the reporter left the area, the munitions had not yet been completely unloaded.</p>
<h3>Pudong's Defenses Are Extraordinarily Solid</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Fire on Non-Resisting Farmers – Such Behavior Violates Humanity</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) This morning, our newspaper reporter met with Mr. Jiang, representing a certain group in this city, who had just returned to Shanghai last night after visiting troops in the Pudong area. He gave a detailed account of the battle situation in the Pudong area. We have selected the details that can be disclosed and recorded them below to share with readers concerned about the Pudong area.</p>
<p>I (Mr. Jiang) crossed over to Pudong from the Gaochangmiao Wharf in Shanghai on the morning of the 24th of this month. At that time, the small trains had stopped running, so I hired a rickshaw to move forward. Enemy aircraft constantly roamed the skies. After traveling more than ten miles, I arrived at a certain place and met with senior military officers to convey the intentions of my visit. The officers expressed their gratitude and stated to me that since the Hong Yang incident, the Pudong area had not suffered from warfare. This was because the Pudong area was an unarmed zone where farmers and poor workers resided. They initially did not expect the stubborn enemy to invade our Songhu in this way. After encountering unexpected setbacks, they attempted to turn to the Pudong area for an advance. Therefore, our troops were ordered to station themselves here at night. On the night our troops arrived, enemy ships suddenly opened fire on us. Our troops retaliated with fierce artillery fire. After several nights of fierce fighting, the enemy was terrified. In recent days, enemy aircraft have often come to various parts of Pudong to reconnoiter and drop bombs, but to no effect. The most chilling thing that the enemy army does is to use aircraft to strafe defenseless farmers in various small villages and towns. The location of the enemy air force's base of operations, the aircraft carrier, is approximately in the sea far away from the Bailonggang area. That is because enemy aircraft are often seen taking off and landing in that area. During the first week or so of the war, the enemy used large logs arranged in rows and a large number of foreign-made motorboats, attempting to land in Nanhui and other places, but ultimately dared not attempt it lightly. Now, our military defense is becoming more solid. If the enemy comes, we will definitely give them a painful blow. According to a recent situation overview in the Pudong area announced by a certain military organization in Pudong:</p>
<p>㊀ The fortifications are extremely solid.</p>
<p>㊁ All sectors of the local community have been closely organized to investigate and arrest traitors, in order to prevent them from detecting military intelligence.</p>
<p>㊂ Pudong refugees are being resettled in different areas to maintain public order and alleviate the people's hardships.</p>
<p>㊃ On the evening of the 26th, seven enemy ships approached the New Mitsui Wharf. They initially strafed with machine guns, followed by twenty to thirty enemy soldiers landing, attempting to go ashore. Our troops suddenly launched a fierce attack, and the enemy fled back in disarray.</p>
<p>Also, at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, eight enemy aircraft came to the Pudong area to reconnoiter, circling for a long time, and dropped three bombs, all of which landed in the fields and caused no damage. They flew away after half an hour. At 4:30 PM, three more came, flying high in the clouds, reconnoitering for about half an hour before flying away.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) Recently, a guest came to Shanghai from Nanhui and told reporters that Shanghai newspapers on the 25th reported that 1,200 enemy soldiers secretly landed on the Nanhui beach and were defeated by our troops, with only 100 survivors. This news is actually surprising. I (the guest) have lived in Nanhui for generations, about fifteen miles from the city. People come and go along the coast every day, and I have never heard of enemy troops landing. Since the August 13th war broke out, Nanhui has been heavily defended because of its strategic location, and has been in a state of high alert from the very beginning. In recent days, groups of aircraft have flown overhead at least two or three times, mostly enemy aircraft, with our air force also present at times. Sometimes, the aircraft flew low, only two or three hundred feet above the ground. The sound of gunfire from the Shanghai battle could be clearly heard. Our troops also occasionally passed through the area, and the order was excellent. The military and civilians were harmonious. Other than that, I have not seen or heard anything. This can be reported to fellow countrymen living abroad.</p>
<p>Impersonating Japanese Aircraft is Too Ridiculous</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th: Japanese propaganda claims that two Chinese military aircraft purchased from Japan, painted in Japanese colors and with Japanese markings, impersonated Japanese aircraft and dropped bombs on Japanese warships in the Huangpu River. A spokesman for the Chinese Air Force, upon hearing this news, immediately denied it absolutely and considered it an insult to the Chinese military. It is claimed that China has never purchased military aircraft from Japan, and the Chinese Air Force is particularly unwilling to imitate the behavior of the Japanese army and commit such a despicable act. Perhaps the Japanese Air Force's bombing was inaccurate, resulting in such a ridiculous outcome.</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper Reporter Discovers Battlefield Situation This Morning</h3>
<p>Enemy Main Force Collapses North of Caowangmiao – Our Troops Kill Enemy Brigade Commander</p>
<p>Last night, our newspaper reporter, along with liaison officers Fang and Xie, and Deputy Officer Wang, went to the Luodian area at about 8:00 PM, detouring from the rear, and met with senior commanders who were directing operations at the front, discussing the situation of each route in detail. The following is a breakdown of what can be disclosed:</p>
<p>Luodian Area</p>
<p>The enemy troops landing north of Luodian at Shidongkou, about one division strong, were formed by drawing elite troops from the 43rd, 44th, and 47th Divisions into a joint formation with strong combat capabilities. Under the cover of warships and aircraft, they advanced towards our Luodian-Jiading line, attempting to break through the Jiading positions and cut off our army's rear. After being greatly encircled by our army from the east, south, and west, they were repelled by our army after dozens of attacks in recent days. The battle for the town of Luodian was particularly fierce. The other day (29th), a unit of the enemy army launched a fierce attack on Luodian. Beforehand, enemy warships concentrated their artillery fire, along with dozens of enemy aircraft, to bombard the Luodian town positions. Our defending soldiers resisted bravely under the artillery and bombs of the enemy army, advancing without retreating, fighting fiercely for several hours, and finally repelling the enemy army. However, our army suffered heavy losses in this battle. □□□□□□□□□□ sacrificed their lives for the country, which was a tragic and glorious death. That night, our side thickened our troops and launched a major counterattack, with fierce fighting all night. The enemy army finally collapsed to the northwest, and our army took the opportunity to pursue. By yesterday morning, our army had pursued to the Yanjiayouche area, and the enemy had collapsed and suffered heavy casualties. We captured many machine guns, rifles, and backpacks, and killed an enemy brigade commander, intercepting a copy of the battle plan. As of 11:00 PM yesterday, the main force of the enemy army's right wing had been forced back to the area north of Wudouzhen in Luodian. In the northwest area, there was still a unit of the enemy army, with our army positions to the southeast. Although each occupies half of Luodian, the enemy army there has been besieged by us for two days and nights. It is expected that it can be resolved that night (30th). Also, yesterday morning, in addition to a unit holding fast to the northwest line of Luodian, another unit of the main force was sent to attack our Jiading area. After our army received the report, it mobilized a large team of fresh troops from □□ to advance towards the northwest of Luodian. When they advanced to the vicinity of Shixianggong Temple, a battle occurred. The enemy army knew that we were prepared and occupied Shixianggong Temple, not daring to advance. After 6:00 PM, our army used concentrated firepower to attack the enemy army near the temple, and the enemy retreated because they could not hold out. Our army immediately recaptured Shixianggong Temple and followed up the pursuit, occupying Caowangmiao, which is north of the temple. At 0:20 AM this morning, when the reporter left the □□ headquarters, they were still confronting each other in the area north of Caowangmiao.</p>
<p>Wusong Area</p>
<p>In the Wusong area, the enemy troops who had secretly landed at Paotaiwan and Shizilin had long been cleared by our side. Although there are many enemy ships outside the harbor that occasionally attack us and aircraft that come to drop bombs from time to time, attempting to land again, our side is strictly guarded, making it impossible for them to take advantage of the situation. Therefore, there have been no changes in the past two days, and it is as quiet as usual. According to reports, the enemy's seaplane airfield is on the sea off Shizilin.</p>
<p>Zhanghuabang Area</p>
<p>There is still a regiment of enemy troops in Zhanghuabang, about 2,000 strong, still holding on to the villages east of Sitang, and they have built stronghold-style fortifications there, with barbed wire and other obstacles. However, our army has encircled them tightly, and although the enemy has repeatedly tried to break through, they have ultimately failed. It is also reported that a unit of the enemy army landed in Zhanghuabang again yesterday morning, but the number of troops is unknown. Along the Pu River from Yunzaobang to Wusong Town, there are still a few remaining enemy soldiers. Yesterday morning, they were attacked by our □□ unit, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. We captured a plate-armored ship at the river mouth.</p>
<p>Yangshupu Area</p>
<p>The enemy troops in the Zhanghuabang area have been trying to break through Jungong Road for days, in order to make contact with the enemy troops in the Hujiang University area and advance towards our Yinxiang Township. Their repeated attacks have all failed. Also, yesterday, the enemy set up nine 15-centimeter howitzers in Yangshupu and fired at various positions on Jiangwan Road. Our □□ side also retaliated with field artillery.</p>
<p>Forming Air Defenses</p>
<p>According to the Chief of Staff of the □□ Division, the enemy aircraft currently bomb and bomb our Dachang and other places every day, but the bombs they drop have no purpose and are simply wasting munitions. This shows the weakness of the enemy aircraft's reconnaissance capabilities. Now our □□□□□□□□□□□ is strictly forming air defenses. Yesterday (29th), two aircraft were shot down by us, so today (30th), the enemy aircraft no longer dare to fly low.</p>
<h3>American Merchant Ship President Hoover Accidentally Damaged by Aircraft Yesterday</h3>
<p>Happened to be Sailing Between Japanese Transport Ships – Our Authorities Express Responsibility</p>
<p>Shrapnel Flew Up and Damaged Ship's Side</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that our Air Force received reports that multiple Japanese transport ships were entering the port on the 30th, so at about 5:00 PM, aircraft were dispatched to reconnoiter outside the Songkou area. It happened that the American ship President Hoover was sailing and was between two Japanese ships, leading it to be mistakenly identified as a Japanese transport ship, so bombs were dropped on it. The bombs fell in the water next to the ship, and shrapnel flew up, causing slight damage to the ship's side 25 feet above the water. Seven crew members were injured, two of whom were seriously injured. Three passengers were frightened, but it was not serious. After this accident, the ship sailed straight to Kobe. The injured crew members were taken to Shanghai by a British ship for treatment.</p>
<p>Statement by Foreign Ministry Spokesman</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th: Regarding the Chinese aircraft accidentally bombing the American merchant ship, the Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement saying that on the 30th, Chinese aircraft accidentally bombed the American ship President Hoover outside Wusongkou, injuring several people. The Chinese government deeply regrets this. It goes without saying that Chinese military aircraft have no intention of attacking any third-country ships. According to initial investigation results, the Chinese Air Force received intelligence today that multiple Japanese transport ships were entering the port this afternoon, and the President Hoover happened to arrive at this time and was positioned between two Japanese ships, leading the Chinese aircraft to mistakenly believe that it was a Japanese transport ship and dropped bombs on it. The Chinese government, in addition to continuing to thoroughly investigate the truth about this unfortunate incident, is determined to bear the responsibility for it and intends to resolve it immediately. The authorities of this Ministry have begun contacting the American Embassy and have telegraphed Ambassador Wang in the United States, expressing the Chinese government's willingness to take responsibility to the American government.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty was signed in Nanjing on the 21st of this month. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally announced it the night before last. The treaty is announced at a time when the world is enveloped in war clouds, and East Asia is suffering from the poison of aggressors. Its most obvious significance is to show that China and the Soviet Union are both great nations that genuinely love peace. Although we have vast borders adjacent to each other, we have no conflict of interest whatsoever. Moreover, at a time when aggressors are rampant and violent, we have an increasingly important shared responsibility to jointly ensure peace and prevent aggressive wars.</p>
<p>The significance of the Non-Aggression Treaty is essentially passive, but its far-reaching influence is positive. This is because, on the one hand, the treaty guarantees the opposition to war and the maintenance of peace between the two contracting states. On the other hand, the treaty is a link in the world's peace mechanism. Its impact on international collective security is profound and immense. In recent years, the situation in Europe has been turbulent. However, due to the conclusion of the Franco-Soviet, Czech-Soviet, and many other non-aggression treaties, the international collective security mechanism has been able to regain strength. Furthermore, the rampant behavior of aggressors has not led to a catastrophic conflagration.</p>
<p>However, in explaining the positive significance of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, we should solemnly point out that although the treaty's far-reaching influence can contribute to general peace, its direct effect is by no means to deal with any country, nor will it affect our respective original relations with other countries. In the process of Japan's aggression against China in recent years, on the one hand, it put forward the demand for 'joint anti-communism' to us, attempting to make China its sacrifice and jointly attack the Soviet Union. On the other hand, it falsely accused any friendly exchanges between China and any country such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union as 'using barbarians to control barbarians', considering it detrimental to its aggression against China. Perhaps after the publication of this Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, the representatives of Japanese imperialism are already using their habitual tricks of slander and discord, fabricating all kinds of malicious rumors to provoke. However, we are by no means afraid of such slanderous rumors today. China is willing to maintain friendly and amicable relations with all democratic and peace-loving countries. This is a fact that is universally recognized. China and the United States have signed a treaty of amity. China and Britain have established an important loan. Recently, our Minister of Finance, Kong, made friendly exchanges with various countries in Europe, which is enough to show that our country's foreign policy is for broad peace and amity, and there is no intention to harm any country. Only the aggressors, with their butcher knives and wolf teeth, have cut themselves off from our country's peaceful and friendly relations.</p>
<p>Between China and the Soviet Union, we know that China's current national policy is to strive for national independence and liberation with all our strength. The Soviet Union's current national policy is to fully engage in socialist construction. Although these two national policies differ due to time and place, their basic trend is to consolidate world peace and promote human progress, which is completely consistent. In recent years, our country's struggles and efforts have been warmly sympathized with by the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's dedicated construction has also been deeply admired by our country. Now, because of the conclusion of the Non-Aggression Treaty, the degree of friendly cooperation between the two sides has taken another step forward. While celebrating this diplomatic development, we deeply hope that the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union can take the spirit of this treaty as a foundation to cultivate a deeper friendship.</p>

A small number of our plainclothes troops made contact with the enemy on the front, then circled around to the enemy's rear to harass them. Because the area was full of overlapping hills and ridges, the enemy suddenly heard gunshots from all around and thought that a large army had arrived from all directions. They were panicked and didn't know what to do. The enemy in front thought that our army was attacking and attacked backward, while the enemy in the rear also fired artillery to counterattack. Thus, they attacked each other all night, and only at dawn did they realize what had happened. As a result of self-destruction, the casualties were extremely heavy.

<h3>British Ambassador's Condition Improving Well</h3>

Thanks to the careful treatment of Dr. Cortlett, the attending physician, his progress has been very good. According to hospital sources, the British Ambassador's condition has passed the critical stage and is improving day by day. His condition was even more improved yesterday.</p>
<h3>British Government Protests to Japan over the Shooting of British Ambassador by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Presents Three Minimum Demands, Violation of International Law Cannot Be Tolerated</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the injury of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, by a Japanese aircraft, the British government has submitted a note to the Japanese government yesterday. Its contents were announced at 5:00 p.m. today, concluding with the following three requests: ㊀ The Japanese government should formally apologize to the British government. ㊁ The Japanese perpetrators should be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. ㊂ The Japanese authorities should provide guarantees and take all necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Note</p>
<p>The note first describes the circumstances of Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's injury, saying that this accident is regrettable. The British government is deeply saddened and extremely concerned to hear the news, and is forced to lodge a firm protest and demand full compensation. "It is inevitable that ordinary warfare practices will indirectly create a risk of injury to non-combatants, including foreigners, residing within the borders of the country concerned. However, international law contains one of the oldest and most established rules, that any direct or intentional attack on non-combatants, whether inside or outside a war zone, is prohibited, and aircraft attacks are not to be regarded as an exception. The argument that it was accidental cannot be accepted either, as the facts show that the Japanese perpetrators were at least negligent of the lives of ordinary people and completely disregarded them. In short, this incident was not an accidental event arising from any ordinary warfare practice, but it is clear that the Japanese aircraft attacked non-combatants, which should have been apparent to the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Japanese side's claim that the car's flag was too small and difficult to see is also unfounded. Even if the car had no flag, there would be no reason to attack it. Regardless of whether the passengers in the car were foreigners and diplomats, it is a fact that they were non-combatants. It is now clear that the Japanese aircraft did not intentionally attack the British Ambassador, but it is undeniable that they wanted to attack non-combatants. This alone is an illegal act.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more thing that needs to be noted, that the area where Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen was traveling was not a war zone and had no Chinese troops. The British government now takes this opportunity to point out that this case has a greater significance, as this type of accident is a natural result of the indiscriminate use of attacks by the air force, and it is even more inhumane and illegal to attack combatants and non-combatants indiscriminately. Moreover, in the current situation, the existence of a state of war has not been declared or explicitly recognized by either China or Japan, so the actions of the Japanese aircraft are even more inexcusable," and so on. (Reuters dispatch, 29th, via Havas)</p>
<p>British Note Delivered to Japanese Foreign Ministry</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The British note regarding the attack on British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen by Japanese aircraft was submitted to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota by British Chargé d'Affaires Dodd today. Hirota claimed that the joint British-Japanese investigation into this matter is currently underway in Shanghai, and that he will contact the British Chargé d'Affaires as soon as he receives the results of the investigation. (Reuters dispatch, 29th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the injury of British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen by Japanese aircraft strafing, news has come from the Japanese side that the United Kingdom and Japan will conduct a joint investigation. British officials recently declared that they have no knowledge of this matter, and said that the British authorities have already completed the investigation. The so-called "conducting an investigation" refers specifically to the Japanese side. (Havas dispatch, 30th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Diplomatic circles here recently commented that the British note to Japan was quite moderate in nature. The three demands made by the United Kingdom are the minimum and it is believed that the Tokyo government will be able to give a satisfactory reply, and it is said that when British Chargé d'Affaires Dodd delivered this note, he must have requested the Japanese government to submit a reply quickly, and must have taken the opportunity to reiterate to the Japanese authorities the need to neutralize the Shanghai International Settlement. As for whether Japan will refuse to accept the three demands made by the United Kingdom, diplomatic circles have not commented, but according to private sources, if Japan does so, the United Kingdom may recall its envoy to Japan. The newly appointed British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, recently set off for Japan to take office and has now arrived in Canada, and may be waiting for government instructions before continuing his journey. (Havas dispatch, 29th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Britain Has No Intention of Taking Retaliatory Action</p>
<p>[London] The British protest submitted to Japan regarding the attack on Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen was carefully worded and is still moderate. The demands it makes are widely regarded as fulfillable without damaging national dignity. According to the opinions of people from all walks of life in Britain, the fact that Japan's imprudent actions have invited this protest is itself sufficient condemnation. The protest does not mention retaliation, and it is heard that the British government does not intend to take further action if Japan does not accept the demands contained in the protest. The British side believes that if Japan refuses these demands, it will directly show the world that Japan is a country that does not respect any international morality. As for the rumor that the United Kingdom will demand compensation, according to the British government, this matter is of great importance and cannot be settled with money. To demand compensation would be to lose one's dignity. The protest does not specify a date for the Japanese government to respond, but the British government hopes that the reply can be issued early so that it is not delayed. (Reuters dispatch, 30th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>British Press Commentary</h3>
<p>Thinking Big, England Continues Efforts for Peace</p>
<p>[London] London newspapers overwhelmingly approve of the British government's note to Japan regarding the injury to British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. The Times states that the note's wording is considered fair by the public. The British government cannot make lesser demands regarding this "shocking act of violence." However, should the British government's demands be more forceful, resentment would be justified, but should not control reason. Now that the demands are extremely reasonable, it is hoped that the Japanese government will immediately and clearly satisfy them. The newspaper further states, "Japan, in its dealings with China, has caused serious damage to the world's civilization structure by disregarding international law. Japan is a great nation and has its own future.  Many of its people are blinded by narrow-minded realities, but those with more reason and foresight will understand that Japan's position in an orderly world and the gradually constructed rules of civilization will be richer than what it can seize by force in a lawless world." The Times continues, stating that the British government, without sacrificing its rights, will continue to strive for peace. However, the current issue concerns the attack on non-combatants, so the British government is not thinking small, but wants to uphold fundamental principles and prevent them from collapsing. Furthermore, the Morning Post states that the entire British public will unanimously support the wording of the note. This "deeply distressing attack" on the British ambassador has shocked the entire United Kingdom. No milder protest can be made regarding this unforgivable act. The newspaper continues, stating that the limit of demands cannot be lowered any further, and the Japanese government should have provided satisfaction immediately without the British government's demands. It is strange that the British government has been forced to resort to protest. The Morning Post also states, "We do not believe that Britain's demands will not receive a good response in Japan, as Japan should not forget the long-standing friendship between Britain and Japan." The Daily Express states that, for the sake of the Japanese government, it should immediately accept the British government's demands and resolve this unfavorable situation for Japan. The changes in the entire situation between China and Japan have made Tokyo feel uneasy. Japan is currently facing a shortage of food, a sharp decline in exports, and the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. The News Chronicle's editorial states that the demands made in the British note should have been given long ago by any responsible government that cares about its own dignity. The Daily Telegraph states that the note is extremely stern but its wording is very humble. The natural expectation is that the Japanese government should immediately satisfy it. The prohibition against attacking non-combatants on land and sea has long been a universally recognized principle. If this principle cannot be applied to the air force, the civilization of the world will face the fear of extinction. The Daily Citizen states that in a world without a strong peace organization, the fear of this can be seen in this British note. Therefore, the future British foreign policy should proceed along the path of restoring the League of Nations. (Central News Agency, 30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japan's Disregard for Law Will Inevitably Lead to Its Own Destruction</h3>
<p>[London] The Manchester Guardian today criticized the attack on British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, stating that it is part of Japan's entire policy in China. The Latin saying, "In times of war, law is disregarded," is now increasingly believed. Both Europe and the Far East disregard the law not only in times of war, but also in times of peace. The world's true anarchists are not found in Barcelona and Moscow, but in Rome, Tokyo, and other places that violate laws, treaties, and good faith. England's only path is to closely unite with those who oppose the disregard for law and believe that unscrupulous behavior will inevitably lead to self-destruction. (Central News Agency, 30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Moscow Announces Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>Considered Another Step Towards Promoting Peace</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Foreign Ministry today announced the full text of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact without comment. Reuters reporters visited the authorities to inquire about the possibility of Soviet aid, but officials generally declined to comment. According to qualified observers, the Red Army will only take action if Outer Mongolia is attacked, as the Soviet Union has a mutual assistance treaty with Outer Mongolia. All sectors of the Soviet Union welcome the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, viewing it as another step towards promoting peace, and believing that China will no longer oppose the Soviet-Mongolian treaty. It is known that the Soviet Union has a special army permanently stationed in the Far East, numbering approximately 400,000 to 500,000 men. It is not known whether the Soviet Union has transported more troops and supplies to the Far East in the past few days. (Central News Agency, 29th Reuters)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Times' editorial recently elaborated on the Far Eastern situation, stating that the Non-Aggression Pact signed between China and the Soviet Union does not add any new factors to the current Far Eastern crisis beyond the already known elements. The most noteworthy thing is that the negotiation of this Non-Aggression Pact occurred precisely during the evolving period of the conflict between China and Japan, which will inevitably greatly shock Tokyo. However, Soviet intervention in the conflict between China and Japan can probably be avoided. First, judging from the domestic situation in the Soviet Union, the Moscow government is unable to engage in war. Second, Soviet diplomacy is quite active in Europe, while in the Far East, it has consistently adopted a reserved attitude. (Central News Agency, 30th Havas)</p>
<h3>Japan's Blockade of Chinese Coast</h3>
<p>Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>[Tokyo] On the 27th, foreign reporters raised five questions regarding the issue of cutting off navigation. On the 30th, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson responded to the questions as follows: 'First Question': What is the meaning of peaceful commerce? Does it depend on the ship's registry or the nationality of the cargo owner? 'Answer': It refers to peaceful commerce carried out by ships of third countries. 'Second Question': What is the meaning of a 'good faith' ship or a 'malicious' ship? 'Answer': There is no room to consider Chinese ships as 'good faith.' Generally, third-country ships are not considered malicious. 'Third Question': What measures will be taken against malicious ships? 'Answer': According to the purpose of cutting off traffic, there is no intention to indiscriminately confiscate ships and cargo, not exceeding the scope of defensive measures. 'Fourth Question': If a Chinese ship falsely claims British or other foreign nationality and flies a foreign flag, what measures will be taken? 'Answer': If a Chinese ship falsely claims another nationality and flies a third-country flag, it will naturally not be exempt from traffic blockade measures.

<p>[Paris] The "Echo de Paris" recently published an article discussing the importance of the air force's position in the Far Eastern War, stating that the repeated bombings of major Chinese cities by Japanese airplanes are enough to arouse a strong reaction from the British and Americans. Therefore, material assistance should be given to China in terms of the air force. In the future, China may even bomb the Japanese islands. The buildings in Japanese cities such as Yokohama and Nagasaki are mostly wooden and easily catch fire. Once bombing is implemented, the damage will inevitably be severe.

<h3>Soong Tzu-wen Reports on the Significance of National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Used to Supplement National Defense Military Expenses, Different from Other Bonds</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The General Association of the National Salvation Bond Promotion Committee was established a few days ago. Yesterday, it specially invited the local press to report on the significance, work, and progress of the promotion. The provincial and municipal branch associations and county branch offices are also actively being organized and are expected to be completed in about half a month, so as to concentrate national efforts to widely promote the subscription. Currently, various rules are being formulated, with particular emphasis on accounting procedures, in order to be orderly. The following are the details:</p>
<p>Chairman Soong Reports on the Significance of Issuance</p>
<p>The association hosted the local press yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM. Chairman Soong Tzu-wen first gave a speech, reporting on the significance of issuing national salvation bonds, saying that our country has been striving for peaceful construction in recent years, and has not been able to devote all its efforts to national defense and military affairs. This time, Japan suddenly invaded with force, and the people's assets have been greatly damaged. In order to consolidate national defense and protect the people, the government has specially issued 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds to be used to supplement national defense military expenses. This bond is different from other bonds. The interest rate is only 4%, and it is issued at full face value. Although the interest is relatively low, it is deeply believed that compatriots across the country, out of patriotic enthusiasm, will definitely subscribe enthusiastically, and the government will also strive to maintain its credit. It is hoped that the press will widely publicize it.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Zhang of the Promotion Group Reports</p>
<p>Deputy Director Zhang Shou-yong of the Promotion Group reported: ㊀ The significance of the promotion: The National Government believes that the promotion of these national salvation bonds is a matter of the people's patriotic enthusiasm, and there must be a strict organization and public accounting in order to gain trust. Therefore, a National Salvation Bond Promotion Committee was established, with a general association in Shanghai, and branch associations in various provinces and cities. In view of the people's desire to save the country, the people are not to be made to simply make donations, but to make the people buy bonds. Therefore, the interest rate is set at 4%, which is almost equal to the interest rate of the people's savings. ㊁ Organization of the promotion agency: The General Association of the Promotion Committee is the highest agency, with four groups managed by members: 1. General Affairs, 2. Fundraising, 3. Propaganda, 4. Accounting, 5. Audit Committee. Branch associations are established in various provinces and cities, and branch offices are established in various counties. Those directly under the General Association, such as the Overseas Chinese Promotion Committee, and the various circles in Shanghai, including the business, industrial, educational, and civilian circles, are organized into general teams and sub-teams to undertake the work. ㊂ Promotion methods: The fundraising agency and the collection agency are clearly separated. The fundraising agency has been described above. The collection agencies include the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and other designated banks. Cash and coins, gold and silver, gold and silver products, securities, and deposit receipts collected are entrusted to the banks for collection. However, temporary receipts should be given for gold and silver products, securities, and deposit receipts, and then bonds should be given according to the actual amount. Other items are received in a separate warehouse. Real estate and items that can be readily converted into cash are entrusted to other agencies for valuation, and then bond tickets are given according to the value. ㊃ Requesting assistance from all sectors for the promotion: Every man has a responsibility for the country's survival. Who is not as good as me in terms of being good? It is hoped that all sectors will do their best to assist in the promotion. During the European War, the burden of war bonds was 249 yuan per person in the United States, 589 yuan in Germany, and 768 yuan in France. Although our country's economy is not comparable to that of the United States, Germany, and France, with a population of 450 million, the average is only slightly more than one yuan. Everything depends on your efforts to advocate and achieve practical results.</p>
<p>Rules for Filling Out Receipts by Collection Agencies</p>
<p>Rules for Filling Out Receipts by the Collection Agencies of the National Salvation Bond Promotion Committee ㊀ Receipts of this association are divided into the following three types (format attached separately): (A) National Salvation Bond Receipt, used when receiving national currency cash for national salvation bonds. (B) National Salvation Bond Goods Receipt, used when receiving various goods other than national currency cash. (C) National Salvation Bond Goods Temporary Receipt, used when receiving various goods whose value cannot be determined until they are sold or appraised. After the value of the item is determined, the bond subscriber should exchange this receipt for a type B receipt from the original collection agency. ㊁ The receipts of this association are printed and distributed by the General Association to the branch associations and collection agencies for unified use. However, those far away may print them directly from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank according to the format stipulated by the General Association, affixing the joint seal of the local branch associations, and distributing them to the collection agencies in the area. ㊂ Each type of receipt is divided into three copies. The first copy of the receipt is signed and sealed by the collection agency and affixed with the seal of the person in charge, and given to the subscriber for safekeeping. The second copy is a report form, which is signed and sealed by the collection agency and sent to the local association on a daily basis. The third copy is a stub, which is kept by the collection agency for future reference. ㊃ When applying various receipts, the collection agency should first code the abbreviation of each collection agency, and then prefix it with the abbreviation of the location of the agency. For example, the Shanghai Central Bank uses the word "Hu Zhong," the Nanjing Bank of China uses the word "Jing Guo," the Guangdong Bank of Communications uses the word "Yue Jiao," and so on, for the sake of regulation. ㊄ Each type of receipt used by the collection agency should be numbered by the agency, starting from number one and going down in order, and cannot be changed or replaced. ㊅ Bond subscribers will later present the receipts issued by the collection agencies to the original agencies to exchange for national salvation bonds of the same amount.</p>
<p>Working Situation of the Accounting Office of the Promotion Association</p>
<p>The accounting group of this association is divided into three sections: ㊀ Registration Section, ㊁ Accounting Section, ㊂ Statistics Section. The registration section is responsible for summarizing and registering the accounts of the general branch associations. The accounting section is responsible for verifying the collection and remittance of bond funds by the general branch associations. The statistics section is responsible for collecting statistics on the collection of bond funds by the collection agencies and analyzing the types of bond funds. In order to unify the powers of the general branch associations and implement scientific management, this association strives to standardize the procedures for collecting and remitting bond funds and keeping accounts by the general branch associations. All regulations regarding accounting are formulated by this association for compliance. As of today, the following have been formulated: ㊀ Types A, B, and C receipts, ㊁ Rules for collection agencies to fill out receipts, ㊂ Rules for local branch associations to collect and remit bond funds, ㊃ Accounting rules, ㊄ Measures for accepting goods to offset bond payments, etc. The formats of vouchers, account books, and report forms used by all general branch associations are currently being revised and will be completed soon. It is reported that in the past few days, remittances from various places have reached more than 1.3 million yuan, and it is expected that satisfactory results can be obtained within the expected period.</p>

<h3>Corpse Collection and Burial Completed at the South Railway Station</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 28th, enemy planes bombed the South Railway Station, causing casualties among the people. Afterwards, various ambulance groups rushed to the scene and rescued hundreds of injured men and women, sending them to various hospitals for treatment. The Shanghai Charity Association and Tongren Fuyuantang sent personnel with carts to carry out more than 30 bodies to the Nanshi Rescue Bureau for temporary placement. Because it was curfew time, there was not enough time to stay, so they continued to go the next morning. Most of the bodies had already been collected by Pushan Villa people overnight. Therefore, only more than 30 bodies were found in the rubble and sent to the Rescue Bureau. The intact bodies were numbered and photographed as usual. The incomplete bodies were recorded in detail according to their clothing and then collected. The money and belongings were copied from each body, numbered, registered, and preserved for future identification by family members. Three employees and two trackmen were killed in this battle at the station. The Railway Bureau gave them generous coffins and buried them temporarily, waiting for their families to claim them later, and agreed to provide compensation. Each injured employee was given 50 yuan for medical expenses. The station platform repair work has not yet started. It will be difficult to restore it to its original state in the shortest period of time. The estimated loss is more than 100,000 yuan. The station has also carried out disinfection work.</p>

In the past three days, it has collected 1,190 pairs of sacks from all walks of life, and 129.29 yuan in national salvation donations, as well as countless comfort items such as flashlights, towels, running shoes, teacups, and undershirts.

<h3>French侨 Donates 1,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>To Relief Refugees and Wounded Soldiers</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the foreign nationals in this port have been making donations in an endless stream.

The Relief and Relief Committees have handled the funds accordingly.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Send Refugees Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>Those Departing Shanghai from the South Railway Station Have Reached 30,000 People</p>
<p>The Municipal War Zone Refugee Relief Committee and other organizations are sparing no effort in their refugee relief work. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war on August 13th, these organizations, in addition to managing refugee shelters, have been sending large numbers of refugees back to their hometowns in batches. In recent days, more than 35,000 people from the countryside, such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, Huzhou, or Wuxi, have been transported to the interior by ships, trains, and small boats. The remaining refugees whose ancestral homes are Shaoxing, Haiyan, Yixing, and Yunnan are also being processed for repatriation. Furthermore, according to statistics, from the 12th to the 24th of this month, 300,000 people have boarded trains at the South Railway Station to various counties along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. It is heard that the Railway Bureau is planning to arrange two trains to depart from the South Railway Station every afternoon to facilitate refugees leaving Shanghai. It is also learned from relevant sources that there are currently 700,000 refugees in Shanghai, of whom 300,000 have expressed their willingness to leave Shanghai and return home. Currently, 4,000 to 5,000 people are leaving Shanghai every day. The details of the repatriation efforts of various organizations are listed below:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Committee's Border Repatriation Team sent 1,052 refugees yesterday on the Qin Yuanji steamer to Suzhou. Another 1,230 refugees were sent on the Gongxin steamer to Suzhou.</p>
<p>The Wuxi Shen Yin'an Shanghai Native Association Joint Relief Society sent its thirteenth batch of 3,400 refugees yesterday (the 30th), led by Wang Zhaonan and Xue Xiren, on fourteen civilian boats towed by tugboats back to Wuxi.</p>
<p>The Hu She has arranged for the repatriation of fellow villagers in distress for more than twelve times, totaling over 10,000 people. Yesterday (the 30th), the twelfth batch of refugees, totaling more than 700 people, was transported on ships from two major companies, towed by barges, directly to Huzhou.</p>
<p>The Cixi Traveling-in-Shanghai Returning Home Association opened a special train at 9:00 yesterday, which arrived safely in Hangzhou at 4:00 in the afternoon. Fellow villagers traveling in Shanghai who wish to return home can register at the association's office at 3 Sanma Road, Shiludong Xiehe Building, paying a subsidized gasoline fee of five yuan per person. In addition, the association's director, Ye Jiaxing, has specially raised a large sum of money to be used exclusively for the repatriation of fellow villagers from Cixi. Impoverished fellow villagers from Cixi who have proper occupations and a guarantor can register with the association for completely free repatriation.</p>
<p>The Fujian Traveling-in-Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, after registering refugees returning to their hometowns, set the deadline at 5:00 yesterday afternoon, with registrations reaching over a thousand people. For the sake of safe repatriation, the association specially consulted with the Refugee Repatriation Committee formed by the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, obtained passports, chartered a Taikoo steamer, and scheduled to send fellow villagers back to Xiamen within days.</p>
<h3>The Propaganda Committee of the Support Association Promotes Anti-Japanese Propaganda Work</h3>
<p>Using English, French, Russian, and Japanese for Broadcasting and Performances So That People of All Countries Can Obtain Accurate War Reports</p>
<p>The Propaganda Committee of the Municipal Anti-Japanese Support Association has been working intensively in recent days. In addition to entertaining foreign guests and providing information some time ago, and notifying various cultural organizations to proceed in unison, it has recently intensified its efforts using various propaganda tools. The general overview of the committee's propaganda work is specially recorded below:</p>
<p>Broadcasting in Foreign Languages</p>
<p>The committee, considering that there are many friendly people in Shanghai from foreign countries, who have witnessed the Sino-Japanese War firsthand and have accurate information, believes that public opinion can influence the policies of their countries. Therefore, it is scheduled to begin broadcasting and lecturing in foreign languages from 6:00 tonight to promote international propaganda. Wang Naizheng and Wang Suizhi have been invited to give lectures in French, Ms. Zeng Shirong to give lectures in English, Wu Qingyou to give lectures in Russian, and Zhou Wenbin and Yuan Wenzhang to give lectures in Japanese. The schedule has been prepared and is now being implemented.</p>
<p>Cartoon Propaganda Sets Off</p>
<p>The first cartoon propaganda team, organized by the committee in conjunction with the cartoon book industry, led by Ye Qianyu, departed last night to the Suzhou-Wuxi-Beijing-Hankou area. They will use the art of cartoons to promote the spirit of resistance against Japan, to awaken the public to the common hatred and fight against the enemy, and to work together for the war of resistance. It is heard that after Mr. Ye and others arrive in the provincial capitals, they will further contact the local cartoon book industry to create similar organizations to go to work in the countryside. In this way, the widespread and in-depth results will be even more significant.</p>
<p>Producing Anti-Japanese War Films</p>
<p>The committee believes that this time our country's war of resistance is not only a war of self-defense but also contains great historical significance. Advancing means fully expressing the spirit, and retreating also means making a heroic sacrifice. It is passionate, tragic, and worthy of praise. If it can be filmed and shown everywhere, it will be most effective in awakening the public and inspiring morale. Therefore, in conjunction with the Shanghai branch of the Educational Film Association, it has begun producing various anti-Japanese war films. Recently, the Japanese air force indiscriminately bombed unarmed civilians at Nanjing Road, the South Railway Station, and other places, and all kinds of atrocities have been captured on film. In the future, the public will never forget this great hatred.</p>
<p>Forming Anti-Japanese Choral Teams</p>
<p>The way of sound is the most touching, and if it can be used well, it is a great tool for propaganda. The patriotic spirit of comrades in the singing circles of this city is particularly enthusiastic. Now, all the more than ten choral groups in Shanghai have been led by the committee to form anti-Japanese choral teams, which have begun singing at radio stations, wounded soldier hospitals, refugee shelters, and other places to inspire the spirit of common hatred.</p>
<h3>Gan Naiguang and Others Arrive in Shanghai to Console Soldiers</h3>
<p>Cultural Circles and Children's Circles Separately Console Wounded Soldiers</p>
<p>Central special envoys Gan Naiguang and Mao Zuquan arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday and went to the front lines yesterday morning to console the anti-Japanese soldiers on all fronts.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cultural Circles National Salvation Association organized a consolation group yesterday to go to various wounded soldier hospitals to console them. They gathered at the association's office on Weihaiwei Road at 3:00 yesterday afternoon and set off at 4:00, totaling twenty-six teams, each with five people, carrying large quantities of consolation items such as handkerchiefs, socks, and shirts. When the team arrived at the wounded soldier hospitals to console them, in addition to making brief speeches to the lightly wounded soldiers, they also provided services such as washing the wounded soldiers' faces.</p>
<p>The Children's Circles National Salvation Association transported a large number of undershirts and wounded soldiers' clothing and trousers to the Wuxi Tongyi Association Wounded Soldier Hospital yesterday morning by representatives of all members. Chen Juanjuan, Tang Genbao, Yang Bijun, Xu Xiangying, Xu Bi, Wang Ziqing, and others sang and gave speeches to console the wounded soldiers, who all stood up to thank them with great anger. They then went to the Eleventh Wounded Soldier Hospital on Dahua Road to console them. In the afternoon, two members were sent to the front lines with the ambulance team to transport undershirts and towels printed with the large red characters "Return Our Rivers and Mountains" to console the anti-Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3>Land and Water Transportation Gradually Resumes</h3>
<p>Trains Between Shanghai and Ping Stop at Suzhou Foreign Ships Successively Set Sail for Export</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, all shipping traffic was completely suspended. Since the Taikoo Company's Shengjing wheel test voyage the day before yesterday, Jardine Matheson and other companies are also seeking to resume. Among those exporting yesterday, the Taikoo Company had the Xin Beijing wheel, which sailed to Shantou, chartered by the Chaozhou and Shantou Fellow Villagers Association, to load refugees returning to their hometowns. The Longshan wheel left Shanghai at 9:30 yesterday morning for Ningbo, carrying many refugees. The Shengjing wheel, which arrived in Shanghai, began loading goods yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Tianjin today. Therefore, the water transport in Shanghai, in addition to Chinese ships, can gradually return to its original state.</p>
<p>From the 30th, in addition to the Beijing-Suzhou train running as usual, the original express train at 8:00 am and the Shanghai-Ping trains at 6:00 pm, which passed through the Sujia Road and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to the Shanghai South Railway Station, have been changed to run to the Suzhou Station as the terminus. The Sujia train will still run as usual. Two more batches of more than 2,000 refugees arrived in Xiaguan on the 30th, and efforts are being made to relocate them. (Special dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Charity Groups and Disaster Relief Associations Relieve Refugees in the Nanshi Area</h3>
<p>Rescuing More Than 2,000 People Providing Shelter and Supplies as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The Municipal Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, in response to the fact that the Nanshi area has been subjected to enemy aircraft wantonly bombing and machine-gunning our innocent people for days, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries, and leaving refugees in a dilemma and in urgent need of rescue, specially dispatched a large number of vehicles yesterday to provide relief several times, rescuing more than a thousand people and transporting them to various shelters for temporary supplies, and adding Minle, Hangzhou, and Guoguang three shelters to accommodate as much as possible.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Orders Dance Halls to Close Down</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, based on reports that dance halls such as the Great Shanghai International and others have resumed business one after another under the guise of relief, believes that during this period of war, there should be no such meaningless entertainment. The bureau has already ordered the dance halls to immediately close down within days.</p>
<h3>The Pingjin Student Association in Exile Was Officially Established Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Life-Saving Bureau Negotiates the Retrieval of Floating Corpses in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The enemy army invaded Shanghai and killed our innocent civilians, throwing the corpses into the Huangpu River. The corpses struck each other in groups of three or five, flowing up and down with the tide of the Huangpu River, with numerous wounds, which was unbearable to witness. Moreover, as time goes by, the sun exposure and water immersion make them rotten and smelly. Prolonged exposure to the tide pollutes the salt water, which affects the drinking hygiene of millions of citizens in this city. The Nanshi Life-Saving Bureau, a charitable organization in this city, plans to retrieve, collect, and bury them, but is afraid that the warships will disregard morality and shoot, which is very dangerous. It is now planned to negotiate with the British and French Industry Bureaus and the health agencies to find a way for the Life-Saving Bureau to send life-saving boats with laborers to search for and retrieve floating corpses along the upper and lower reaches of the Huangpu River, and try to collect and bury them to restore sanitation.</p>
<h3>The North Sichuan Road Post Office Awaits Collection of Foreign Mail</h3>
<p>The Post Office announced today that the North Sichuan Road Post Office has 2,000 foreign-sent packages awaiting collection. Those wishing to go to the post office can take Henan Road or Jiangxi Road Bridge.</p>
<h3>The Campus of Fudan University Was Destroyed</h3>
<p>The Fudan University General Affairs Office recently reported that, according to people from Jiangwan, the buildings of Fudan University that were destroyed include the entire gymnasium, the Zibin Institute (Science Museum), and three dormitories, all of which were severely damaged. The enemy army's brutal means of destroying our country's cultural institutions are further proven here.</p>
<h3>The North China Daily News Bitterly Criticizes the Atrocities of Japanese Aircraft Bombing the South Railway Station</h3>
<p>Konoe Said, 'China Must Be Beaten Until It Kneels' Only Increasing the Spirit of Resistance Against Japan and the Indignation of Global Public Opinion</p>
<p>The North China Daily News published a commentary yesterday on the bombing of the South Railway Station by Japanese planes, which read: Japanese Prime Minister Konoe announced to the world, saying, 'Japan must beat China until it kneels and no longer has the spirit to fight.' The Japanese people, if they can truly know how this mission is being carried out today, they will surely be shocked by it, and those who are more thoughtful among them will even doubt it. Several Japanese planes bombed the South Railway Station in the Nanshi area the other day. Observers with a little knowledge can know that the place is full of hundreds of displaced refugees, waiting to escape to Hangzhou to avoid the disaster. The Japanese army's determination to implement an orderly terror to achieve Konoe's goals, now there is no need to waste ink expressing enthusiasm and commenting on it. However, the bombing of Nanshi is a frenzied crime that everyone can imagine violating humanity and must be condemned. The Japanese authorities' claim that Chinese troops happened to be passing through Nanshi at the time cannot be used to cover up the fact that even if it were true, Japanese planes would never have bombed such a large crowd of terrified women and children. Moreover, according to the Chinese army commander, there were no soldiers or military vehicle positions in Nanshi. The actions of the Japanese army seem to be ordered to commit violence and fill the eyes of the world. Today, Shanghai's refugees are coming like a tide, distraught and in hardship, which cannot be described, but all are bravely enduring it. This can be seen everywhere on the sidewalks and in the alleyways. Among these people, there are many mothers who bravely risk death and try to suppress their fear to protect their children. Their Japanese mothers, living comfortably in their own country, if they could see the crimes that the Japanese people have committed against Chinese mothers and children, they would be shocked. This kind of thinking cannot help but arise in the minds of evil people. What Nanshi suffered, everyone has experienced it personally. Alas, in the name of 'purging' Hongkou 'building trees', how many atrocities have been committed behind the scenes?</p>
<p>If we express our full sympathy for the suffering of China as a result of this cruel and destructive act, then we must also express our fear of Japan. Konoe cannot deceive himself into thinking that he can defeat a 'great power' with such means of terrorism, making it kneel. History and psychology tell us that a nation that is united and resists foreign enemies is motivated by brute force and irresponsible evil words and is not deterred by them, whether it is Chinese or not, and cannot be subdued. Sino-Japanese friendship is beneficial to Japan, no less than to China. Now, with reckless and cruel actions, it shows that it cannot respect the contract of human relations, so what chance is there to create it? It is sometimes difficult to control new-era destructive weapons, but when control obviously fails and the area of slaughtering civilians is expanded, from occasional to intentional, there is really nothing to argue about. Japan itself, for the military problems of China, must be able to achieve a rapid and broad solution, but repeatedly committing such atrocities will only make its work more difficult. The result of this kind of atrocity is only enough to strengthen the Chinese people's will. Nanjing now regards air strikes as commonplace, which shows that the unity of China, which was difficult to hope for a few weeks ago. The weapons and equipment of the Chinese army, although inferior to the Japanese army, their bravery the Japanese people have to prove it. Those foreigners in contact with the Chinese army in the western district praised the Chinese army for its strict discipline, its united will, and its vow to kill the enemy. Now, it is given a reason for a fervent support of national rights, which is no small matter. Then, what effect can the arbitrary slaughter of civilians have? It only makes the Chinese people more believe that Japan's ultimate goal is to reduce the Chinese people to slaves, and thus arouse the common hatred. The word 'I would rather die than be a slave' has now been used by Chinese soldiers as a motto to resist the enemy to the death. Although Japanese spokespersons will dismiss it as a 'rhetorical phrase', world history is full of evidence that this kind of determination will reduce the difference between the strong and the weak and should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Foreigners in China all acknowledge that the root cause of this war is Japan's entrustment of its national conscience to military aggression. This is in line with the world's emotions, and therefore all condemn Japan's current adventurous attempts. At the same time, foreigners here have different views and allow for the recent statement by British Foreign Secretary Eden regarding Japan's economic difficulties. However, this newspaper (the North China Daily News) has always believed that one cannot forcibly seize another's property for economic reasons. Courts in ordinary civilized societies often disagree with this view. This weak reason for reducing general criticism of Japan will be completely destroyed by Japan's actions. The bombing of Nanshi is the most recent and profound proof. Can Japan bear to intensify the world's hatred for Japan as a result of this? This is what everyone and sincerely wants to ask. The Chinese people and the government, forced by Japan, are trapped in a difficult position. The world expresses sympathy for them. This kind of sympathy has infinitely increased because of the infinite suffering suffered by the Chinese people. General public opinion is now finally aware of the cruelty of Japan's artificial indignation movement, borrowing the false name of revenge, and applying the thunder to the Chinese people. The attack by Japanese planes on the Shanghai-Nanjing highway, thanks to God's blessing, did not become a tragedy. The Chinese people were all happy, because they all felt that if everyone had died at the time, the Japanese would have falsely claimed that it was done by the Chinese army, and the Chinese would have no way to prove themselves. Cannot Japanese people with clear heads consider such things and use appropriate planning and humanity to change the policy of directing such inauspicious signs to use troops in Chinese territory? This kind of trampling on peaceful places and destroying happy families will have no end. Konoe's envoys may try to order China to kneel, but their actions are only enough to arouse the Chinese people's national salvation spirit and will be mourned by the descendants of Japan.</p>

<h3>Stalled Progress Around Songkou, Enemy Forces Fiercely Attacked Zhabei Again This Morning</h3>
<p>We dealt a heavy blow head-on, the enemy retreated in panic. The enemy camp northwest of Luodian was occupied by our troops. The enemy counterattacked Caowang Temple, fierce fighting on both sides. The enemy's position at Zhanghuabang was shaken.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Fiercely Attacked Zhabei This Morning</p>
<p>Artillery and Troops Concentrated on the North Station. We Valiantly Repelled Them.</p>
<p>According to reports from the front this morning, the enemy in the Luodian area is confronting us across the river around the Xujing Port area. Although they are still putting up a stubborn resistance, they are already surrounded by our troops. The time for their elimination is not far off. The remnants of the enemy on the Jiangbian of Zhanghuabang are still being cleared. Before dawn this morning, the enemy on North Sichuan Road launched a fierce attack on our Zhabei area, concentrating artillery and troops around the North Station. We valiantly repelled them, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, who retreated in panic.</p>
<p>From 11:20 pm last night, enemy warships in the Huangpu River and enemy artillery units in Yangshupu fiercely attacked our positions in the Naval Training Ground and Jiangwan Road, covering the enemy forces in Tientong'an and Bazibqiao in a counterattack towards our Zhabei Bazibqiao and Patriotic Girls' School. Our troops fought back bravely, and our [missing text] artillery also bombarded the enemy's positions with field guns. The enemy launched several assaults, but were repulsed by us. Therefore, until this morning, the sound of artillery and machine guns from both sides continued incessantly for as long as six or seven hours. The intensity of the battle was evident.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Northwest of Luodian Collapsed</p>
<p>We Occupied the Enemy's Camp This Morning. The Enemy Fled to Wudouzhen and Surrounding Areas to the North.</p>
<p>This morning, a liaison officer from a certain military organization returning to Shanghai from Luodian said that our troops began a three-sided encirclement and bloody assault on the enemy forces northwest of Luodian Town last midnight. The enemy forces responded hastily, putting up a stubborn resistance for a long time, but eventually, without reinforcements from the rear, they collapsed and fled to Wudouzhen and surrounding areas to the north, suffering heavy casualties. Our troops took advantage of the victory to pursue and, at dawn this morning, occupied an enemy camp resembling a headquarters in a certain area northwest of Luodian, seizing many spoils of war. This shows the enemy's disarray during their retreat.</p>
<p>Enemy Counterattacked Caowang Temple This Morning</p>
<p>We Suppressed Them with Artillery and Machine Guns. Fierce Fighting Still Ongoing as of 10 AM This Morning.</p>
<p>Confirmed reports indicate that the main force of the enemy, attempting to break through our Jiading line from the northwest of Luodian, was repulsed by our main forces north of Caowang Temple. At dawn this morning, the enemy assembled naval gunfire, dispatched a large number of aircraft, and began a three-dimensional bombardment of our [missing text] positions. Land forces also simultaneously launched a counterattack on the Caowang Temple and Shi Xiangong Temple area. Our troops responded calmly. The artillery positions in the [missing text] area also returned fire with artillery and machine guns, suppressing the enemy's advance. As of 10 AM today, fierce fighting was still ongoing.</p>
<p>Enemy Counterattack at Zhanghuabang Failed</p>
<p>We dealt a heavy blow head-on, the enemy collapsed and retreated again. We took advantage of the victory to pursue this morning and made progress.</p>
<p>About two thousand remnants of the enemy in the Zhanghuabang area entrenched themselves in villages east of Sitang, setting up defensive works such as barbed wire. Yesterday morning (30th), a small portion of the enemy landed again, reorganized their ranks, and hoped to break through our encirclement. Our army, with its strong force, dealt them a head-on blow. Intense artillery fire and hand-to-hand combat lasted for a long time. The enemy army, unable to withstand, collapsed and retreated, suffering heavy losses.</p>
<p>Another report states that from midnight yesterday to this morning (31st), our troops in Zhanghuabang continued to advance towards the enemy's positions, taking advantage of the victory to pursue. Our artillery also accurately targeted and fiercely bombarded the enemy, causing the enemy's positions to waver, their morale to be disrupted, and they fled in disarray. We have made considerable progress again.</p>
<p>Our Aircraft Reconnoitered This Morning</p>
<p>Flying Over Hongkou and the Huangpu River, Japanese Warships on the River Panicked</p>
<p>At approximately 3 AM this morning, several of our aircraft flew to the Hongkou area and the Huangpu River area for reconnaissance. More than ten Japanese warships docked there panicked and fired anti-aircraft guns and machine guns wildly into the sky, using searchlights to illuminate the sky. For a time, more than ten beams of white light swayed in the sky. However, our planes did not drop bombs and flew away after completing their mission.</p>
<p>Between 2 AM and 3 AM this morning, our air force squadron carried out bombing raids on the enemy's positions in the Yangshupu area of ​​eastern Shanghai, dropping several bombs that hit their targets. The enemy suffered considerable damage. At the same time, aerial combat occurred with enemy aircraft in the Wusong skies. Our air force was mighty, brave, and agile. At the time, several enemy aircraft were forced to land on the Huangpu River. At 3:05 AM, all enemy aircraft were defeated, and our air force began to regroup and return. During this operation, the rear of the enemy in Wusong was also heavily damaged by our air force.</p>
<p>Information Obtained by the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Western District and Huangpu River Area Are Peaceful, Several Stray Bullets Landed in the Yangshupu District</p>
<p>According to Shanghai Municipal Council news, from 6 PM yesterday (30th) to 10 AM today (31st), the Western District and the Huangpu River area were very peaceful. However, the fighting in the Northern District was very fierce. According to reports from the Yangshupu District, several stray bullets landed in the concession between 2:45 AM and 3:05 AM today. In the Hongkou District of Huishi, at 6:40 AM this morning, a cannonball exploded near the Aierjin Road vegetable market. The houses in the vegetable market were destroyed by the explosion, and three people were injured. The extent of their injuries is unknown.</p>
<p>Reports from the police stations north of the Suzhou Creek this morning all stated, "Everything is peaceful, and no one was injured."</p>
<p>From 6 AM to 8 AM today, four Japanese military aircraft flew over the Shanghai area, presumably conducting reconnaissance.</p>
<p>From 8 AM to 10 AM, it was quite quiet. However, it was reported that cannonballs frequently fell near the Guangzhao Villa in Zhabei. Several fires broke out in the Zhoujiazui Road area near the border of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Frequent Enemy Troop Movements in the Eastern District</p>
<p>Most Concentrated at the Osaka and Other Docks</p>
<p>According to an employee of a certain company who took a steamer from Yangshupu to Shanghai a moment ago, the enemy's base in the eastern Shanghai district of Dinghaiqiao has seen frequent troop movements in recent days, seemingly with the addition of reinforcements. However, it is impossible to prove whether regular enemy troops participated. The areas with the most enemy troops currently concentrated in Yangshupu are the Osaka, Huangpu, and Mitsubishi docks. However, only a small number of enemy troops are stationed at the Huishan Dock.</p>
<p>Inhumane Acts by Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>Bombing Refugees and the Wounded, Over Two Hundred People Perished</p>
<p>At about 10 AM yesterday, about two hundred refugees and wounded soldiers who had been rescued from the war zone were staying at the Yangxing Town Long-Distance Bus East Station. At that time, a squadron of enemy aircraft suddenly arrived, circling in the air several times, and suddenly dropped more than ten bombs. These more than two hundred displaced refugees and wounded soldiers, unable to escape, all perished. The enemy aircraft's repeated bombing of refugees and the wounded is inhumane and can be said to have reached its extreme.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Collapsing Enemy Troops Was Embarrassing</p>
<p>Guns and Uniforms Had Been Discarded, Wearing Only Undershirts and Short Military Pants</p>
<p>According to a tugboat crew member of a certain foreign shipping company, at 8 AM yesterday morning, they were heading to Yangshupu on business. On the way back, they saw several trucks carrying retreating Japanese soldiers at the Zhaoshang Central Warehouse in Hongkou. These soldiers had discarded their guns and uniforms and were only wearing undershirts and small short military pants. Their embarrassing appearance was indescribable.</p>
<p>Japanese Gunners Fired Aimlessly</p>
<p>Shooting Dozens of Miles Outside the War Zone, Only Destroying Houses and Not Injuring People</p>
<p>Japanese gunners are extremely inexperienced, often firing aimlessly. The night before last, they indiscriminately shelled non-combat areas in Pudong, causing cannonballs to destroy two houses belonging to Wu Zhusheng in the Shanghai circle, and also destroyed two houses belonging to Hai Long in Chenqi Bridge Village, Tangqiao. Because the villagers had all fled in recent days, no one was injured. However, the above two locations are dozens of miles away from the war zone, which proves the disruption caused by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Enemy Ammunition Steadily Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>After two enemy transport ships, the Befa Maru and the Tensho Maru, arrived in Shanghai yesterday, bringing a large amount of ammunition, the Shanghai Maru continued to sail into Songkou last night and is now berthed at the Osaka Dock. According to an investigation by reporters this morning, the ship began unloading ammunition last night and, as of about 10 AM today, there were still thirty or forty enemy soldiers continuing to unload, which was very busy.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Are Preparing to Resume Sailing</p>
<p>The Taikoo Shengjing Ship Resumes the North China Line, British Merchants' Marr Ship Carrying Refugees to Ningbo</p>
<p>After the war gradually shifted outwards, the situation in the local port became slightly more stable. Foreign shipping companies have begun preparing to resume sailing. At 7 AM this morning, the Taikoo Company's French Concession Wharf and the Huatong Company's two wharves in Pudong simultaneously resumed work. The Pudong Jiajiajiao Blue Funnel Taikoo Company also began shipping goods. In addition, the Taikoo Shengjing Ship, after importing yesterday morning, is scheduled to export this afternoon, resuming the North China liner route. A British-owned Marr Company merchant ship transported more than 2,000 refugees taken in by the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association back to Ningbo at the Zhaoshangju Jinliyuan Wharf at 10 AM this morning. It is heard that the British-owned Qiahe Company also intends to prepare for the resumption of sailing of its ships, but because the company's wharf and warehouse are located in the Hongkou war zone, it is inconvenient for passengers and goods to board and disembark, so progress is quite difficult. As for the factories and warehouses in Pudong, only the Yizhong Cigarette Factory in Lujiazui began shipping goods this morning because there is a shortage of goods everywhere and a large number of cigarettes are needed. There is no movement at other factories.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attacked Guangzhou, Two Were Shot Down by Us</h3>
<p>Seven Japanese Aircraft Participated in the Attack, Two Enemy Aircraft Were Shot Down in Humen</p>

<h3>We Submitted a Note to the League of Nations Detailing Japan's Aggression</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Violated Treaties and Attacked Chinese Cities, Making Every Effort to Destroy Our Decade of Construction</p>
<p>[Geneva] Dr. Hu Shize, the Chinese Minister to Switzerland, delivered a note to the Secretariat of the League of Nations this afternoon, detailing the conflicts between China and Japan since the Lugouqiao Incident on July 7. It is generally believed here that this is the prelude to China's complaint to the League of Nations. The note first stated that the Chinese government has always maintained a compromising attitude. In addition to fulfilling various agreements, it has repeatedly proposed to Japan to stop the war, but to no avail because Japan deliberately invaded and tried to expand the war. The conclusion is divided into four sections, the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>"(1) Japanese troops have invaded Chinese territory and used land, sea and air forces to attack Chinese cities in northern and central China. This is a purely aggressive action and is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>(2) Although China has exhausted all methods to prevent violent aggression, all have failed. It has no choice but to implement resistance. This is China's exercise of its natural right of self-defense.</p>
<p>(3) Japan's aggression against China was originally based on a predetermined plan. This plan began with the September 18 Incident in 1931 and is still being implemented. Although Japan has repeatedly stated that it has no territorial ambitions for China, it has occupied the Tianjin area and decided to advance into the entire North China in order to control other parts of China. It can be seen from the fact that Japan has made every effort to destroy China's construction projects, which have been painstakingly managed for ten years.</p>
<p>(4) Japan has violated various international treaties one by one. For example, the country's deliberate destruction of peace in the Far East violates the basic principles contained in the Covenant of the League of Nations. The country uses war to achieve its national policy and disdains the use of peaceful means to resolve international disputes. This violates the 1927 Pact of Paris. The country does not respect China's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. This violates the 1922 Nine-Power Treaty."</p>
<p>Finally, the Chinese government requested that the above-mentioned facts be notified to the member states of the League of Nations and the member states of the Advisory Committee (including the United States) established on February 24, 1934, due to the incident in the three northeastern provinces of China. (Central News Agency, Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] After the Chinese government submitted a note to the League of Nations accusing Japan of deliberate aggression, League of Nations officials commented that this was the prelude to China's formal complaint to the League of Nations. Although the Chinese government's note did not request that the dispute between China and Japan be placed on the agenda of the next regular session of the General Assembly of the League of Nations (which will be held on September 13), China is a semi-permanent member of the Executive Yuan and can file a complaint in accordance with Article 17 of the Covenant during the meeting of the Executive Yuan or the General Assembly of the League of Nations. Article 17 of the Covenant states that when a dispute arises between a member state of the League of Nations and a non-member state, the non-member state should be invited to recognize the obligations of the member state and resolve the dispute according to the conditions deemed proper by the Executive Yuan. (Central News Agency, Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>Germany Not Surprised by the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>Believes It Is A Way for Our Country to Ensure Security, Soviet Russian Newspapers Unanimously Support It</p>
<p>[Berlin] The political circles here do not express excitement about the signing of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, but judge it with an objective attitude. Although some people worry that China may be influenced by Bolshevism in the future, on the other hand, they believe that General Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese government will actively implement anti-communist policies, and it is expected that their independence will not be affected by the Communist Party. Therefore, the German political circles tend to regard the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty as a security measure, believing that the purpose of the Chinese government is to avoid disputes that are harmful to China's efforts for peace and to enable China to mobilize its national defense forces. It is solemnly stated here that, from this point of view, it is not surprising that the Chinese government decided to conclude the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty. (30th National Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Regarding the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, the local "News" reports that it is another manifestation of the Soviet Union's inviolable peace policy. The newspaper continues to elaborate on the principle of indivisible peace. The argument of "Pravda" is roughly the same as the above, and it is said that the conclusion of the treaty is sufficient to prove that the Soviet nation has a great liking for the Chinese nation's struggle for freedom and independence, and that the treaty itself is a new tool for peace and collective security. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>Germany Does Not Lend Money to Japan</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Well-informed sources here claim that the report published by a certain news agency, saying that Germany is willing to lend a huge amount of money to Japan for the purchase of military supplies, is not in line with the facts. It is solemnly stated here that Germany has no intention of taking this step in the future. (30th National Haitong Telegram)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Pinghan Line for Several Days, Enemy Positions Have Been Shaken</h3>
<p>Our Plainclothes Team Reached Changxindian Station, Liangxiang City Is Surrounded and Can Be Recovered Soon</p>
<p>[Baoding] Our reporter returned from an inspection of the front line on the 30th. (1) There are more than 20,000 enemy troops stationed along the Pinghan Line. The headquarters is located in the Changxindian Pinghan Workers' Union Auditorium. (2) Our vanguard is now at Nantianbao, confronting the enemy. (3) The fighting from the 20th to the 28th was extremely fierce. In the Battle of Pindingshan, we fought hand-to-hand with the enemy nine times, and the enemy suffered 3,000 casualties. (4) The front line was quiet on the 29th and 30th. (5) Our plainclothes team is very active. One team has reached Changxindian Railway Station. The enemy's position has been shaken. (6) Enemy aircraft have repeatedly dropped bombs on Fangshan, Zhuoxian, Liulihe, and Gaobeidian in recent days. Our losses were very light. Seventeen bombs were dropped on Liulihe on the 28th. (7) On the front of Pinghan, we have advanced to a certain area north of Doudian. (8) Liangxiang City has been surrounded by our heavy troops and can be recovered soon. (9) The enemy army between Ping and Chang has been cut off from contact by our plainclothes team. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Without Permits Deported from Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou] The Commissioner's Office of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi officially notified consuls on the 30th that all foreign residents and entrants must have passports. Those without passports and stateless people will be deported to prevent bandits from operating and to protect the safety of foreigners. (30th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacked Xuzhou</h3>
<p>[Xuzhou] At 6:30 on the evening of the 30th, six enemy aircraft flew to Xuzhou to attack and dropped more than ten bombs. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Brief Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the inhuman actions of the enemy have been too numerous to describe. The most unbearable is the indiscriminate attacks by aircraft on innocent civilians everywhere. For example, the bombing of the Sincere Company on the Great Eastern Road and the bombing of the South Railway Station caused the tragic deaths and injuries of no fewer than a thousand innocent civilians. In addition, the attack on the British Ambassador and the massacre of Red Cross rescue workers are cruel acts of a barbaric nation and should not be committed by a self-proclaimed civilized country. Therefore, a Western newspaper said, "The Japanese are so violent, and Konoe said that China must be tied to its knees, which only increases the spirit of resistance against Japan and the indignation of global sentiment." It is indeed true. If Japan wants to tie China to its knees now, please stop dreaming this kind of sweet dream.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Rear Area's Emotions Amidst the War of Resistance (2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>After the Country Is Lost</p>
<p>When a country and nation are unfortunately subjected to persecution by a powerful country's army pressing on the border, step by step, if the officials and people of the whole country do not raise their arms and shout, and everyone rises up to take on the responsibilities that our ancestors have given us for thousands of years, and take on the responsibilities that hundreds of millions of descendants look up to us for, and resolve to die without changing, and risk a hundred deaths to fight for survival, then it will be very difficult to reverse the situation after the misfortune of the country's loss. Because the tools for destroying people's countries and exterminating people's races in modern times are really too vicious. Let me give a small example.</p>
<p>One day, on the grasslands of Kunming Lake, I saw two middle-aged men in ill-fitting Western suits exploring the meaning of whether China can truly resist Japan this time from a certain passage in Chiang Kai-shek's "Half-Month Record of Xi'an". The two men held positive and negative reasons, and their debates were deadlocked. At first, listening to their tone, I suspected that they were Cantonese. After chatting with them, I realized that they were Vietnamese Kuomintang members.</p>
<p>One of them said to me: He had participated in the "Anbai" uprising. After the failure, he fled to Yunnan. Unexpectedly, he and several other comrades were designed to be tied up by a "traitor" from his own ethnic group, hidden in a cargo box, and escorted back to Vietnam via the Yue Railway. Fortunately, he was discovered and released by customs midway, and almost suffocated in the box.</p>
<p>He continued: A few months ago, the Governor-General of Vietnam (French) visited Yunnan to visit the Yunnan authorities. They, these poor insects, were suddenly detained by the police station again. It is said that the police station was afraid that they would assassinate the Governor-General and cause trouble for the host! If the facts are indeed like this, then the pain they suffered spiritually must be a thousand times greater than the detention. Otherwise, suffering this "unforeseen disaster" is also a "wrongful grievance".</p>
<p>Finally, at the time of parting, they shook my hand tightly and said: "Friends! If you don't work hard to save the country before it is lost, and vainly hope to restore the country after it is lost, it is indeed a task that is as difficult as turning mountains and seas upside down! I hate that I have not mastered Chinese well enough to write this meaning in detail, in order to inform the compatriots of the motherland who are facing national disasters and still have the opportunity to resist Japan!" These heartfelt words from fellow countrymen suffering from the same disease, can they not touch the hearts of the people?</p>
<p>Ethnic Revolutionaries</p>
<p>In a certain village in Tengyue, western Yunnan, lives a "national revolutionary" who is nearly seventy years old. He is the Crown Prince of Burma, named "Jiang Kuo". If Burma had not been lost, he would, of course, be the one to inherit the orthodoxy and ascend the throne. But the ruthless reality has declared that he is a pathetic and tragic protagonist in the history of the country's loss.</p>
<p>When the British began to invade Burma in 1823, the Burmese in general felt the dim future of the nation, but were shocked by the strength of the British, and responded to all harsh demands with a "half-hearted" attitude. Later, when they saw that the situation was too bad, they hastily gathered a large army to carry out resistance, but unfortunately "the general trend was gone" and it was of no avail. By 1886 (sixty-three years after the start of the invasion), it was finally destroyed by the British.</p>
<p>"Jiang Kuo" was one of those who "knew that it was impossible to do it" and yet resolutely decided to protest with soldiers. His spirit of resistance, "knowing that it cannot be done and doing it," is ultimately worthy of our admiration. He now relies on practicing medicine and farming to solve his livelihood problems. Although his age is not without the illusion of the afterglow of the setting sun, his ideas of restoring the country are not depressed, and the secret promotion of the restoration movement has never been interrupted. Therefore, in this long period of more than forty years of exile, he has often gained the sympathy and assistance of people in terms of spirit and material.</p>
<p>During our national crisis, reading the little history of "Jiang Kuo" described above, we can at least gain three kinds of lessons: (1) When a country encounters foreign aggression, only having a psychology of retreat and complacency, without the determination to resist early, will inevitably lead to the destruction of the country. (2) The enemy uses the policy of gradually nibbling away, which is like our sitting and suffering the slow slicing of the head of the executioner. Don't say that the bits of skin and flesh can be endured, you must know that what follows is the heart. (3) National heroes who resist Japan and save the country, even if they ultimately fail, will inevitably gain infinite sympathy.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Nankou</h3>
<p>Tang Enbo's Troops Valiantly Resist the Enemy; Engagements at All Passes of the Great Wall</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Dispatch: In recent days, battles have erupted at Nankou, south of the Ping-Sui Railway, and at various key passes along the Great Wall. Our troops defending the territory are determined to fight to the death against the enemy, resulting in extremely fierce battles. The situation of the battles on various fronts is recorded below:</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting at Nankou</p>
<p>At dawn on the 12th of this month, the Japanese army increased its forces by more than 5,000 infantry, 80 artillery pieces, and 30 tanks, launching a fierce attack on our Nankou positions. Simultaneously, fierce fighting also occurred in the areas of Huyucun, Deshenkou, and Sulin Kou near Nankou. By the end of the evening, the enemy had launched five or six fierce attacks on our positions, all of which were repelled by our forces. Thirty enemy aircraft also assisted their ground forces, constantly bombing our positions. Officers and soldiers of our Luo and Tan regiments were particularly brave. After the enemy retreated at night, they returned on the 13th with a large number of aircraft, tanks, and most of their land forces. Our defending soldiers also resisted desperately, making the fighting even fiercer than before, until nightfall when they entered a state of ceasefire. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this battle, while our side also suffered some casualties. According to Chief of Staff Cui Gongchen of the ××× Division, General Tang (Enbo) reported in a telegram from Nankou this afternoon (the 13th) that the battle at Nankou today was exceptionally fierce. Our morale is doubly strong, and the enemy has suffered heavy losses. Our side has also suffered considerable losses, but even with the last soldier, we are determined to fight the enemy to the end. According to my own (Cui's own statement) observation, even if there are slight changes in our Nankou positions, it is due to strategic considerations and should not affect the overall situation.</p>
<p>Battle Situation at Various Passes of the Great Wall</p>
<p>According to Cui, the battle situation at various key passes along the Great Wall on the (above third) day was roughly as follows: ㊀ In the Shenweitai area, at noon, there were more than 70 enemy plainclothes soldiers, two tanks, three armored vehicles, and three aircraft. Their purpose seemed to be to scout our military positions. The enemy plainclothes soldiers first opened fire on us, and the tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft simultaneously assisted in the operation, fiercely attacking our positions. Our army responded calmly until 2 p.m., when the enemy was unable to sustain and retreated. The enemy aircraft dropped seven bombs, none of which caused any damage to us. ㊁ At Xinkai, at 2 p.m., there were enemy cavalry and artillery forces falsely claiming to be more than 2,000, but actually numbering only 500 or 600, who engaged in artillery battles with us for a long time. They were also repelled by us by the evening. ㊂ At 2 p.m., in the area west of Hannuoer Dam, including Huicailiang and Dahonggou, there was a company of enemy mortars, a company of mountain guns, and more than 130 infantry, also falsely claiming to be 1,000, who charged at us. Our defending soldiers were determined and responded calmly, and the enemy did not succeed and retreated. ㊃ In the northwest of Ximalin, there was a large enemy force, whose purpose was to break through our Ximalin positions towards Dahonggou, occupy Chaigoubao, and cut off the connection between Chahar and Suiyuan. Our side is prepared and should have nothing to fear. According to military news, engagements have occurred at various passes along the Great Wall, from Shenweitai in the west to Taizicheng, east of Chicheng County. At around 11 p.m. on the 13th, several hundred enemy soldiers and more than 20 armored vehicles repeatedly launched fierce attacks on our Dahonggou Huicailiang positions on the right side of Shenweitai four times in succession. Our army responded calmly, and they were unable to succeed. Until around early morning on the 14th, the enemy returned with the same forces, but their fierce momentum was also crushed by our army. On the same night, several dozen enemy soldiers and one armored vehicle, also carrying a cannon, invaded our positions at Sanjianfang, northeast of Qingbiankou, but were also repelled. Around Dushikou and Tangzikou, more than 80 enemy soldiers were also discovered on the same night, advancing towards us. Our army launched an attack, and the enemy initially resisted stubbornly but eventually collapsed and fled in disarray. When our army advanced to the Batu Ying area, the enemy hurriedly boarded prepared vehicles and fled. Near Taizicheng, east of our Chicheng County, the enemy increased a regiment, planning to advance on us immediately.</p>

<h3>Arrest of Male and Female Traitors in Wuxi</h3>
<p>A Japanese Military Flag Was Found in a Small Fishing Boat; The Situation Is Serious and Has Been Referred to the County Government for Interrogation</p>
<p>Wuxi Dispatch: The Yiyong Zhuang Ding Defense Team of Beita Town, First District of Wuxi, while patrolling outside on the evening of the 25th, saw a suspicious small fishing boat under the river in front of the Chen Shuntai Rice Shop. They boarded the boat to search it and discovered ten wooden chops such as Wang Jiang and Jin Guan, an Autumn Water auspicious black flag, a piece of Japanese women's clothing, a Japanese military flag, and a white towel with the words "Kagoshima Prefecture, Kawauchi Town, Kumanoshiro School District, Anti-Defense Women's Association." They also found a destroyer flag. They immediately interrogated the owner of the fishing boat, who claimed to be named Wang Guixi, from Gaodun, who had been fishing along the Yangtze River in Shanghai. He firmly denied being a traitor. Later, a Japanese copper coin was found on him. Subsequently, 25 yuan in legal tender was found on his wife, Wang Ji, with hidden marks such as "Suzuki" on the legal tender. Considering the seriousness of the situation, they were both taken into custody. On the 26th, they were presented to the district office and then transferred to the county government for interrogation. In addition, the Yiyong Patrol Team of Huihe Town discovered a suspected traitor, Gu Linkang (from Jiangyin), near Wuqiao Tui on the evening of the 26th. Two unfinished pencil drawings of the Weidi were found on him. The drawings resembled the Wuqiao Lixin No. 9 and No. 2 factories. He was handed over to the local police station and transferred to the county for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Recent Status of Food Supply in Various Places During the Emergency Period</h3>
<p>Sufficient Rice Stocks in Wuxi; Various Counties Ordered to Prohibit Rice from Leaving the Area</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the price of white Xian rice rose nearly to the top due to the smooth procurement of military grain. The County Chamber of Commerce, aware of this situation and fearing that various businesses would release speculative orders, specially gathered leaders of the rice industry to discuss ways to maintain the people's food supply and restrict rice prices. After the regulations, the price of white Geng rice was set at ten yuan and five jiao per dan, and white Xian rice at nine yuan and five jiao, and they were not allowed to raise the price arbitrarily. Currently, the stocks in various piles are abundant, with more than 300,000 dans of Geng rice and more than 100,000 dans of Xian rice, which can be used to supply the new goods. Therefore, people's minds have been softer in recent days, and sellers have also moved. The market is flat, and the lower market is close to the corner, about Xu. On the 21st, the opening price of Fenbai rice was ten yuan and five jiao, rough Geng nine yuan seven jiao to nine yuan, machine-processed rough nine yuan to seven yuan eight jiao, Geng rice five yuan five jiao to five yuan three jiao, Yangxian rice five yuan three jiao to four yuan six jiao, and Ke rice five yuan one jiao to four yuan five jiao. Due to the closure of the flour mills, the new white Geng from Jiangyin has also been put on the market, each quoted at eleven yuan and five jiao.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>The authorities have long entrusted the Rice Industry Association to prevent grain from leaving the country. Currently, all rice merchants have complied with the order to cease trading with neighboring counties and have decided to send personnel to guard the various sea outlets to intercept any rice boats.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Wan Yuan Rice Shop in Yiling Town, Zhong Street, Sixth District of Jiangdu, accepted an introduction from Zhou Liangfu, a staff member of Da Shun Pawnshop, and contracted with a certain Tao from the guest (elsewhere) province to unload 40 dans of rice and transport it to Jiangnan. When it was being loaded onto the boat at noon on the 18th, it was discovered by Baozhang Han Shimin, who reported it to the Town Public Office and notified the Water Police Team to detain the rice boat in order to maintain the people's food supply and prevent aiding the enemy. Now, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Xue Guangzu, has ordered the shop to cancel the contract, unload the rice, and register the stored rice within three days when it is purchased, so that the association can prepare for inspection to prevent smuggling.</p>
<p>In addition, villagers in Maqiao Township in the Fourth District and Yantao Dinghuo and other townships in the Seventh District habitually row to the rice-producing areas in Xinghua Gaoyou Lower River in early autumn to purchase rice and transport it back to grind for sale as a sideline occupation during their leisure time from farming. However, this year they all returned empty-handed, saying that rice prices were too high. The price after grinding was twice as high as in this county. When asked about the main reason for the high price of rice, they said that someone was buying it at a high price to transport it to various branches and seaports in Jianfu to sell to enemy merchants at a price of eight or nine yuan per dan, making a substantial profit.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The provincial government, considering the current extraordinary period, has made full preparations for the province's food supply. It has immediately issued an order to all counties in the province to prohibit the export of rice and grain. At the same time, it has also begun to investigate the amount of food stored in the province for several months to see if it can meet the needs of the extraordinary period. According to relevant sources, Jiangsu Province has had two years of good harvests, and food reserves are abundant, enough to meet the needs of the extraordinary period.</p>
<p>Wujiang</p>
<p>Dafeng and seven other rice shops in Tongli Town in this county recently loaded 3,390 shi of rice and grain and smuggled it to Shanghai. They were detained by the water police in Anzhuang Town, Qingpu. The Rice Industry Association of this county telegraphed to request their release. County Magistrate Ji of the county sent a telegram to the province for instructions, stating that a large amount of rice and grain was being transported to Shanghai without a passport, and that the matter would be handled after the province approved it.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The county's food supply was previously ordered to be fully prepared to prevent urgent needs. Currently, the rice shops in the city and towns are being investigated. In addition to saving as much as possible, all the grain stored in the rural warehouses has been supplied for several months. Soon, the new grain will be harvested, and the rice supply in the four townships is expected to be sufficient. The Chamber of Commerce is still worried that there may not be enough, so it has also purchased a large amount of grain from the Jinlan Shangjiang area to prepare for the accumulation in the urban area. However, the price of rice has been rising again in recent days. The Rice Evaluation Council of this county has specially decided to increase the price of rice by two jiao from the 21st: top white eleven yuan two jiao, second white eleven yuan, and lower grade ten yuan.</p>
<p>Anhui</p>
<p>The Department of Finance, considering that this province is a rice-producing area, should make a special contribution during this extraordinary period to increase military food supplies. It has already issued an order to the local banks, branches, and agencies in the rice-producing areas of the province to follow the rice purchase method established by President Cheng Zhenji of the head office. From the date of the order, they should immediately purchase as much as possible locally of dry rice of the upper and middle colors that can be guaranteed not to produce insects and mold for six months. They should pack it properly in burlap bags and transport it to the provincial capital for transportation to the front lines. All purchase funds and other purchasing expenses should be advanced by the branches and agencies and offset from the head office's account. The local branch has already started large-scale procurement.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Announces Temporary Enrollment Measures for Students in War Zones</h3>
<p>Students from Unregistered Secondary Schools in War Zones May Also Use These Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, considering that the war in this city broke out suddenly and that many public and private secondary schools have fallen into the war zone, and that all students attending these schools are affected by the war and transportation is obstructed, making it impossible for many to continue their studies at their original schools as usual, has formulated temporary enrollment measures for students in secondary schools in the war zone in order to facilitate students' access to education and provide relief to those who have dropped out of school. The measures were announced and implemented yesterday. The original text of the measures is recorded below: ㊀ All students of public and registered private secondary schools of all grades who are unable to continue their studies at their original schools due to the war may temporarily enroll in equivalent grades of public or registered private equivalent schools. ㊁ When a public or registered private secondary school receives a student's request to temporarily enroll in another school, it should immediately fill out a temporary enrollment certificate, the form of which is as follows: Temporary Enrollment Certificate (attach student photo) Student □□□, age □, from □ Province □ County, studying in the □ grade of the □ course of the high (middle) school in the □ semester of this school. This semester's grades are passing (failing) and should be promoted (held back). This is to certify that he has requested temporary enrollment. Principal of Public (Private) □ School, Republic of China, Year, Month, Day. ㊂ When a public or registered private secondary school receives a request for temporary enrollment from a student in a school in the war zone, it should review the submitted temporary enrollment certificate, continue to enroll him in the equivalent grade, and notify the student's original school. After the temporary enrollment is completed, the student's temporary enrollment grades will be transferred to the original school, and no documents need to be given to the temporary enrollment student. The student's original school, upon receiving the temporary enrollment grades transferred by the temporary enrollment school after the temporary enrollment student's temporary enrollment period expires, will determine whether to promote, hold back, or graduate the student. ㊄ Public and private secondary schools in this city that intend to accept temporary enrollment students should, in addition to handling matters in accordance with the third item, report the names of the temporary enrollment students, the names of their original schools, and the temporary enrollment grades to this bureau for review within one month after the start of school. ㊅ If a temporary enrollment student wishes to transfer to the school where he is temporarily enrolled, the school where he is temporarily enrolled should strictly examine him. If he is deemed qualified, he may submit the examination results to the competent education authority for approval to change him to a regular student. ㊆ Students from unregistered private secondary schools in the war zone may also use the temporary enrollment measures to temporarily enroll in public and registered private secondary schools. However, the temporary enrollment school, in addition to transferring the temporary enrollment grades to the original school, may not give any documents or request that he be changed to a regular student. ㊇ These measures will be suspended on the day the war ends.</p>
