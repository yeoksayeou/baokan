<h3>日本後方　民氣極激昂　谷大使會見記者團談話</h3>
<p>日駐華大使谷正之氏，昨（二十三）日上午十一時在滬會見記者團，闡明該氏前次返國時決定之對華施策，並力言後方日本人民氣極爲激昻，最後希望在華日人，一致奮起。茲誌談話內容如下：</p>
<p>充分力量　推行戰事</p>
<p>余此次返國至東京，最感到深切的爲後方國民士氣愈益激昻，以及日本尙有充分力量推進戰事。敵機空襲日本本土，，日盜頻仍，後方早已成爲前方，惟已慣此，一見敵機即感戰事已近身邊，官民上下協力，今日已發展爲戰友愛的結合，故不問敵機來襲，增强生產毫不受阻礙，使國內資源的動員，尙留餘相當程度之力量，由此一點，可以認識日本進行作戰，今後猶有充分能力。敵人不顧流血強行登陸作戰，企圖摧殘日本戰力，惟彼等之目的，恐難達到。</p>
<p>實施對華經濟施案</p>
<p>此次在東京決定之對華經濟施策，並非標新立異，不過是將過去未曾實施者，迅速付諸實施而已，以適應戰局之需要。主要內容是當地機關三位一體，作綜合的運營，以及加强與東京間的速繫。</p>
<p>日前大東亞省派安藤總務局長來華，業於南京舉行大使館事務所長會議，討論內容爲物價·通貨·生產·運輸等有關問題。要之，唯一目標在急速推行當地戰力化。安藤總務局長對當地經濟情形，已有深切認識，今後對於經濟施策，當可完成預期目的。</p>
<p>關於維持　儲券價值</p>
<p>關於維護通貨價値，原有積極與消極的二個對策，前者如增加生產，收回通貨，發行證券等，後者如此次實施之物價對策緊急措置等，但對於維持儲備券價値，始終堅特日圓十八對儲券一百元之比率，同時並逐步推進具體的對策。</p>

<h3>中樞講求簡政　擬定各辦法　變更組織等手續辦求簡約</h3>
<p>南京二十三日中央社電　中樞當局爲適應戰時需要，講求簡政辦法，業經第六十四次國防會議通過二種原則，其一：嗣後中央各機關及所屬機關之親織，如須變更（包括裁併及增設）凡決定原則及修正條文等手續，應力求簡的，其二：嗣後行政院各部會署，不因適應需要對主管事務增收規費，罰金罰　時，爲簡約手續起見，准先將增收原則提出行政院會議議決，轉呈中央政治委員會核定。至有關法規條例，由主管部會署依據核定原則修正後，呈行政院核定或備案，毋庸提出會議或轉呈中央政治委員會，惟應咨送立法院審議者，仍由行政院照例辦法。關於第一項幷特擬定辦法四項如下：</p>
<p>變更組織四項辦法</p>
<p>（一）各院及國府直屬機關組織擬變更時，應先將原則呈請中央政會核定，至有關組織之法規條例，由該機關依據核定原則修正後，呈送中政會發交立法院審議，毋庸提出中政會會議。（二）行政院各部署組織擬變更時，應將原則運同修正之組織法，呈請行政院會識議決，以原則呈中政會核定，至修正之組織法由院逕咨立法院審議，毋庸呈送中政會。（二）行政各部署對所屬機關組織擬變更時，應由各部署先將原則呈請行政院會議議決，幷由院呈中政會備案，至有關組織之法規條例，由主管部署依據核定原則修正或草擬，呈行政院核定，毋庸提出行政院會議，但有關二部以上者，仍應召集有關處署代表開會審查，如照條例並應咨送立法院審議。（四）凡軍事機關組織擬變更時，由軍委會參照二三兩項辦法，但應送立法院審議之法規條例，如因軍機關係不送立法院時，仍應送國防會議。</p>

<h3>郭培淾著文　論歐洲危機　德決奮戰完成歷史使命</h3>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　德國社訊，郭培爾博士在德國週刋發表一文，其大意如次：斯達林在巨前雖不思及公開發表其計劃，但渠之奴隸二萬萬人，現方艱苦工作，以實現其計劃。斯氏夢想將來之世界，受莫斯科國際之獨裁統治，羅邱斯之間雖已有所協定，但如德人放下武器，則蘇聯將佔據東歐及東南歐全部及德國之大部份，然後即使此廣大之地區隔絕，而從事大規模屠殺其民衆。倫敦及紐的之猶太報紙或將加以譽揚，英國將來將更少能力，以進行代表其自身利益之歐洲及世界政策。一九四八年羅斯福總統將告落選　，靧上共和黨之孤立派爲總統，其第一項舉措，大槪爲將美軍自歐洲撤回，此舉將必受全美民衆之讚揚。英國在此次戰爭中，已被迫放棄其二百年來之均勢政策，而在歐洲承認一世界强國，此强國非至將英國亦包括於其獨裁之範圍下，決不罷休。此次大戰爆發前四星期，德元首曾提議調整英德之外交政策，德國應尊重英國之海權，英國應尊重德國之陸上　，空中勢力則均等，由兩國合力保證世界和平，果如此則共產主義不致蔓延。現共產主義已臨沃特河，其能否被阻遏，則全賴於德軍之抵抗，此爲戰局之情况。雅爾達會議之公報未能加以改變，吾人所有者，爲吾人之實力及理想，吾人決不加以放棄，此乃吾人生存及完戰歷史任務之先決條件</p>
<h3>松島部長闡述　硫磺島戰局　敵美軍損失慘重</h3>
<p>盟邦日本艦隊報道部報道常會，於昨日下午三時舉行，到松島部長，松本大尉及囑託林俊夫，坂爪，王炳南，劉鎭南並各報記者等，由松島部長發表談話，對硫磺島戰局及太平洋上敵美之損失等，闡述頗詳。大要如次：</p>
<p>硫島日軍堅強邀擊</p>
<p>二月十六十七兩日，敵美之有力機動部隊，出現於東京　南方海面，其航空部隊向關東南方之日飛機塲轟炸，同時進行硫磺島之攻略戰，空襲時之敵機，十六日總數的爲一千架，十七日爲五百架以上，日方對敵人之轟炸，事先早有準備，空軍邀擊之下，擊落敵機三百架以上，日方之損害則甚少。敵美艦隊係由史博恩斯指揮·巡洋戰艦及航空母艦等數量甚鉅，並由馬利亞納島出動龐大空軍，但敵方所獲之戰果，殊爲渺小。敵人進攻硫磺島利用有力之艦隊，掩護其第四第五兵團登陸時，遭遇日方堅强之邀擊，其苦戰爲此次戰爭中空前所未有，敵美登陸軍隊，數約三萬人，至二十一日止損害已在一萬人以上，艦船的二十五六艘，敵万損失之鉅，可以想見，而日軍則始終堅守主要地魯，至二十二日敵方員兵之損失，已達一萬二千人，爲補充兵力起見，乃又以一師團登陸。三百碼之地區而已，敵人以苦戰大利，士氣大爲沮喪，其指揮官曾下令「凡臨陣脫逃者立刻處死」，日軍則沉着應戰，利用空軍及陸上部隊協力迎擊，</p>
<p>登陸敵軍　損失慘重</p>
<p>敵美於硫磺南端開始登陸後，即分兩部兵力進攻，一部攻擊中央地帶，一部則攻至西方之摺鉢山，但其進展只有二海上則利用潛航艇擊敵，故敵美乃遭受空前之大損失，以數擊統計，其損害如下：至二十一日止敵美陸上損失員兵一萬二千名，海上八千五首名，平均每天爲陸上五千名，每一小時爲二百名。硫磺島面續爲三十二平方公里，敵人佔據十公里，其每佔據一公里之損失，爲一千二百人，故此一戰役中敵之損害程度，較之以往吉爾伯特，瑪金，塔那瓦之戰尤過之。其往襲東京之航空隊，於空襲完畢後，仍飛回硫磺島東方海面補充，但迎日則因其機動部隊受損過鉅，無法補充，減少活動矣。</p>
<p>菲島日軍實行奇襲</p>
<p>菲島方面敵美以第三十七師團及騎兵第一師團，合攻馬尼刺，十四日後日軍由馬尼刺北部發動奇襲，至十七日已將巴爾馬幹及奎松飛機塲之敵方主要兵力壓制，並衝至馬尼刺市內，與當地日陸海軍連絡，此舉實出敵美意料之外，美軍乃陷於混亂狀態。故目下馬尼刺之攻防，雙方巳變易位置，而敵美軍則已逐漸處於被殲滅之地位，故最近美方對於菲島之戰事頗爲　默，一般人殊以爲異，當則因遭受此項奇襲之大打擊，馴至有話說不出耳。</p>
<p>敵方宣傳別具作用</p>
<p>目下日軍平洋方面，已屆發動大攻勢之時期，我人對於前綫將士奮勇苦鬥，固所感激，而於中國方面之種種協力，以完成此大東亞戰爭，尤於欽遲，現在敵美作戰之能力，已發揮至最高點，其陸長史汀生最近曾稱：如美國不能以迅速而適當之方法補充第一綫之兵力，則戰事將無辦法，其急迫可覘一斑。又在此戰局緊張之中，敵方一再宣傳日軍在菲島及新幾內亞方面，大殺菲人及爪哇人，實則均屬虛偽之宣傳，測其用意，無非爲引起一般人對日之反抗，並爲將來在中國大陸或日本本土登陸作戰時，殺人之藉口而已。過去中國有一部份人預料日本在大東亞戰爭中結果必遭失敗，此種觀念，亟應肅正。</p>
<p>無稽謠言完全不克</p>
<p>昨日有友人自東京來滬，談過去曾謠傳日本九州之大村地方（佐世保附近），屢遭敵人B29型機轟炸，幾已夷爲平地，街道難以辨別云云，此種謠言即一部份日人，亦有信之者，今據目覩，則完全不確，所謂飛機轟炸，其炸彈不知落於何處，地方上固未有若何之變動現象，可知流言之不足信，有如此者。又最近敵美進攻硫磺島所用戰艦船艇，達六百艘之多，但自十九日登陸至廿一日止，進展只二百碼地方，過去滬上一部人對敵美之兵力評價過大，實屬謬誤，亟應猛省。</p>
<p>德國軍民作戰到底</p>
<p>關於歐洲戰況，德軍對已進至柏林附近之蘇軍，在在正發揮其斷乎反攻之態勢，康尼斯堡。史丹丁。法蘭克福及其南方，均有猛烈之反攻戰事，西線對英美軍亦正進行强有力之反攻戰，德國軍民均抱作戰到底之精神，充份發揮其作戰能力，我中日兩國如能協力到底，則擊滅英美保衛東亞亦易事耳。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>論工業疏散</h3>
<p>現代的戰爭是總力戰，不論前方或後方，不論其爲生產者，或運輸者，全是整個戰爭體系中的一部；所以破壞對方的生產機構，阻滯其交通運輸，是作戰的重要步驟之一。目前大東亞戰爭已達決戰階段，敵方的空襲，在勢難免，上海又是後方重要基地，所以，上海的工業與周遭的交通工具，也可能爲敵方空襲的目標。這是應當注意的第一件事。</p>
<p>疏散工作已在籌備實施，僅靠勸導不能克服一般人的惰性，今後於必要時或將實行强迫疏散，但是這還不是澈底的解決辦法。試分析一般市民留滯上海的原因，大部份仍因職業關係，認爲離開上海，不易生活。所以解決疏散後的職業問題，是應當注意的第二件事。</p>
<p>今後交通運輸，日趨困難，因此，上海市民生活所需的農產物，農村所需的上海工業生產品，在交換上亦必日趨困難，影饗於都市及農村人民的日常生活至鉅。這是應常注意的第三件事。</p>
<p>要解決這三件事，我們認爲疏散上海的工業，確是値得者慮的問題，願貢管見，以期引起本市工業界的注意，並供中日當局的參考。</p>
<p>試就工廠方而的立塲着想，實施疏散的有四個難題：</p>
<p>第一是動力問題。目前市內大部分工廠，都以電力爲動力，自置發動機的很少；一旦疏散，小城鎭中固然沒有充份的設備供給工廠用電，就是想自裝引擎，資力與技術上也有許多困難。</p>
<p>第二是廠其簡題。目前在內地覓屋不很容易，便是能找到適當的廠屋廠基，諸如向當地政府取得設廠許可等問題，也很煩難。</p>
<p>第三是運輸問題。工廠的機件巨大沉重，不比一般人的行李易於搬移，然而技術上的困難，尙易解決。據我所知：太倉常熟方面一班新開的廠家，將機器自滬運去時，在運輸過程中，從取得搬運許可，一直到路上的詔難勒索，其困難殊非一般人所可想像。</p>
<p>第四是資金問題。工廠方面雖寗願忍受一時遷移的損失，但在遷移過程中所需的流動金也相當巨大；目前財政緊縮，不必說官方的資助，便是向金融界籌借這筆款項，也頗不容易</p>
<p>工業疏散，誠然是極繁重的工作；但不是無法解決的事。目前生產事業不能單純視爲盈利組織，應視之爲戰爭機構的一部；在這次戰爭中的各參戰國家，莫不將疏散工業一事，列爲重要的國策，不顧工作如何艱鉅，耗費如何龐大，工廠方面寗願忍受，政府方面也全力協助。那末上海工業的疏散，如果能下決心，同時得到政治力量的支援，縱因疏散而產生種種困難，自可减少到最小限度。</p>
<p>其次，目前本市工廠用電，限制　嚴，因此依靠電力發動的工廠，亦即是上海大多數中小廠家，今後隨時有减工或停工的可能（現在停工的已很多）。與其在目前苟延殘喘，則不如放遠目光忍受眼前的不便與損失，乘這個時機，爲將來奠定永久的基礎。希望工業界自動就有關的廠家，合爲一組，例如甲工業與乙工業往往有連繫性，初加工與再加工的工廠不能分離獨存，遷至安全地帶。一組的工廠合設個發電裝置，不但費用因分担而較小，更因爲經濟比較寬裕，技術上的困難也易解決。如此動力就不發生問題了。</p>
<p>本市的疏散委員會，應另設專門的一部，如工廠遷移委員會之類。這個委員會，必須網羅有關軍政機關，如經濟局·保安司令部·封鎖管理處·水上警察隊·疏散目的地之縣政府等，又必須包括金融業，主要的是中央儲備銀行，以及工業專家等。然後共同研究妥善的實施方案，指定應疏散的工廠及遷移地點。地點必須分散而不集中，必須在鄕村而避免城市，必須交通便利，必須能利用天然林木爲防空的掩蔽。然後一組一地的遷移，由委員會支援取得遷移及設廠許可，由銀行放款，由軍人押運，由工業專家指導並解決技術上的困難。如此運輸·資金·技術與政治上的幾個重要問題，均可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>過去龍章造紙廠與六河溝鐵廠的大煱爐，在十分困難的環境中，尙且能安渡千里外的三峽；那末，上海中小工廠，難道不能疏散到朝發夕至的農村？疏散以後，就工廠方面言，有些原料燃料可以就地取給，人工伙食可以比較低廉·空襲的危險可以減少。就政府方面言，那一個參戰國家的政府，不在協助工業增加生產？不在使工業化整爲零？政府的支援工業疏散，是義不容辭的事。就疏散委員會言，上海是個工商業都市，工商從業員及其家屬，佔據市民的最大部份，在這對外貿易停頓的今日，商業幾乎也依賴着市內的工業。一旦工業疏散實現，至少工業從業員及其家屬必然隨同遷移，疏散的目的自然更易達到。</p>
<p>疏散工業，關係重大，不僅在戰時應如此，在平時也應如此。希望負責疏散的常局，能予以特別愼重的考慮。</p>

<h3>日神風機隊猛攻　繫沉敵艦船七艘　硫磺島海面不端發見火柱</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日軍航空部隊神風特別攻繫隊，二十一日下午曾攻繫硫磺島週圍之敵機動部隊，繫沉或繫毀敵航空母艦兩艘及敵艦船五艘。據自硫磺島高地觀測報吿，二十一日下午五時五十五分，該島東方海面之敵艦船羣中，突然發生大火災，自遽處即能望見，是日六時更確認該島東南方海面發生十處大火柱。又六時五十分，自東方至東南方海面。復確認有十一處發生大火，以上報吿已證實均爲日軍神風物別攻繫隊之攻繫戰果。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　硫磺島之敵登陸軍，自二十二日午前七時起，於艦砲射繫及重戰車與中型戰車部隊之掩護下，進出南部落方面，經日軍第一綫陣地之猛烈反攻後，現兩軍正激戰中。同時日軍戰軍部隊，亦對敵戰車隊展開凄壯之激戰，一方於該島西部之敵隨同一部戰車隊，曾自千島部落方面向北方之囤蘇台方面進繫，經該方面日軍部隊之勇猛反繫後，將其繫退，並且追繫至屬（阿蘇台）西南一公里，至二十二日下午七時止，西海沿岸之敵，已不得自西方千島部落後退若干地點。又與此同時激戰中之南部至北方地熱原方面，亦由於日軍之猛攻，將敵由第一綫繫退，因之擬通過地熱原到達元山機塲之敵，已受前方日軍之猛烈阻止。即十九日登陸以來，不顧損害，個圖强行進繫之敵軍，因遭日軍之不斷反繫，不但完全停止，更因全員之繼續遭受損害，致戰鬥力亦因之滅退，而陷於不得不後退之狀態中矣。</p>
<p>二根濱地帶展開白刃戰</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　硫磺島之日軍突繫隊，於二十日深夜至二十一日晨，曾進攻敵軍第一綫步哨陣地，作毀敵方物資倉庫及武器，彈藥多數。又日軍一部刻正活躍於二根濱地帶之敵軍登陸地點附近，與敵軍展白開刃戰，幷斃敵多數。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　硫磺島之敵軍，二十二日傍晚在該島東南部之南部登陸地點設置浮橋二道，停有運輸船二艘，該浮橋在日軍射繫圈內，因經猛烈攻繫，致難使用</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地二十三日中央社電　敵軍自於硫磺島登陸以來，倐已三日，經日軍奮勇邀繫，寸步未進，刻兩軍戰綫與二十日傍晚毫無變化，然敵軍仍於南碼頭南飛機塲等地構藥橋頭堡，陸續自南海岸增援之登陸部隊，已遂萬餘。至二十一日下午六時，敵軍第一綫似已自西登陸地點以迄千島砲台，舟見台，高砂台等登陸地點，布成戰綫。於舟見台南方地區集中戰車及砲兵，旋自南飛機塲與登陸地點附近繼續向前方運輸兵員器材，情形異常混亂。然敵軍刻僅出現於飛機塲北方，對北日軍陣地猛施砲繫，日軍士氣益昂。該處高地構築之北部陣地，堪稱爲日軍苦心完成難攻不落之堅陣，日軍據守陣地，對敵軍施以猛烈砲火或火剪彈，使敵重創。據傳摺鉢山陣地之日軍以寡敵衆，不顧敵軍包圍，正以不屈之精神，繼續奮勇應戰。</p>
<p>尼米資發表硫磺島戰况</p>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　尼米資司令部二十二日發表稱：「因硫礦島日軍猛烈之抵抗，美軍幾不能前進，美軍現又以海軍一師登陸，增强兵力，日軍對此正以大砲白砲等猛烈抵抗中」。又美聯社二十二日電報稱：向中央機塲逐次北進之登陸敵軍，已完全被阻於飛機塲之前方，南部地區日軍之抵抗，亦逐漸增强，美軍現正據守摺鉢山陣地，以戰車及火焰放射哭，與日軍激戰中。二十一日午後由於摺鉢山東側日軍之猛烈反繫，美軍計喪失戰車四輛，且日美兩軍現已展開接近作戰，美軍已不能獲得空中掩護，只能於戰車火焰放射器，機槍等火器捱護下，對日軍繼續激鬥。美軍衛生部隊，海岸物品搬運部隊及登陸用舟艇中之兵士，莫不遭受日軍之砲繫，此次因又有海軍部隊一師，重新登陸，故總兵力計達四師，刻仍繼續苦戰中。又從軍記者蘭茲巴克替敘述激戰情形稱：激戰中之硫磺島，並無一定戰綫，整個小島　則爲灰務滿佈，入夜則爲冷氣所包圍，自十九日美海軍部隊進抵南權塲附近，該地及摺鉢山一帶遂作爲戰線。實則凡砲火所及之沿海一帶，隨處莫不皆成戰綫，因全島不過五英里，更因日軍砲火甚烈，故並無所謂安全地帶，日軍刻正利用島上所有洞穴等掩護物，猛烈抵抗中，日來美軍雖以數千噸炸彈自海空雙方猛炸日軍陣地，但日軍之抵抗並不見減，於登陸作戰之第三日，敵軍已感覺該島爲太平洋上唯一困難之戰塲，如須將該島完全破壞爲止，尙須多少時間，實無人能下斷言。</p>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據華盛頓來電，合衆社太平洋艦隊司令部電報稱：　自二月二十一日夜至二十二日硫磺島美軍海兵隊之四部戰綫數次阻止熾烈之反攻，　二月二十二日向中央飛機塲開始進攻，美海兵隊遭日軍之猛烈砲繫，至二十二日下午，美軍於誼雨中遲遲進攻，繫潰日軍火砲陣地數處，使其機塲弱化，但前綫陣地幾無變化。　摺鉢山正同之美軍與北部戰綫相呼應，再開始攻勢，至正午美軍於最困難情勢下，開臺襲繫摺鉢山之正面。　美艦隊向日軍硫磺島北部地區陣地浴以重砲火，雖於降雨及不良之氣候條件下，海軍航空隊，仍以重砲繫機槍掃射及喑火砲援助地上部隊。　二十一日日軍轟炸機及戰鬥機隊，攻繫硫磺島週邊之美軍水上艦艇數隻，予艦艇數隻以許多困難。　至二十一日下午五時四十五分，地上差軍之死傷，合計四千五百五十三名。　兵站補給之登陸，因火山海岸土賣關係，甚爲困難，現仍繼續。</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據前綫訊，硫磺島現以摺鉢山附近及南飛機塲之北方地區爲中心，日夜續行激戰，尼米資司令部二十一日所發表公報稱：獲得南飛機塲附近之立足點之第五水陸兩用作戰部隊，於二十一日向中央飛機塲進攻，另一部隊刻正在該島之南方與日軍交戰中。協助兩戰地之海軍部隊，因日軍迫繫砲火箭砲之發射猛烈，展開寸土必爭之大決戰，又日軍刻正反攻美軍侵入地域內之各據點，二十日夜日軍於砲火及單車之掩護下，攻繫美軍左冀，美軍不得已亦以艦砲發射砲彈及照明彈，掩護其陸上部隊從作戰，由此可知美軍刻事正陷於苦戰狀態中。</p>
<h3>馬尼刺市街戰　仍熾烈進行　呂宋平原北部無變化</h3>
<p>呂宋前綫二十三日中央社電　馬尼剌之市街戰，現仍極熾烈，日軍守備部隊據守伊沃蘭脫斯舊城及其附近中央部政局市公署，菲律賓大學附近建築物之殘墟，作强行猛烈反繫，尼克爾斯機塲附近，馬尼剌市南部巴塞一帶，巴科附近及沿海地方，已到處化爲戰塲，因敵軍累攻該城不下，宣明行破壞攻繫之後，自二十一日起，遂開始凄烈之砲繫及轟炸，其後至傍晚，更以戰車三，步兵五百侵入該城之一角，但因日附海軍部隊協同猛烈反繫，結果已將其繫退。尼克爾斯機塲附近及馬尼剌南部巴塞地區，因日海軍部隊對敵展開勇敢之拼撞戰法，現激戰情形極爲猛烈，於巴科附近之戰鬥，已破壞敵戰車六，殺傷敵兵四百以上，並鹵獲火焰放射器及其他兵器多數。科列基多島之日陸海軍部隊，仍確保各處丘陵及密林周邊之陣地，對敵展開大激戰，使敵損害極大。又該島仍在日軍手中之砲台，對於該島周邊遊弋中，且時以艦砲射繫之敵艦艇十數艘加以砲繫，同時，並阻止敵艦艇使其不能由南地兩道侵入馬尼刺灣。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　自馬尼剌東北方高地出繫之日軍部隊，十七日進出於安加特，向六百之敵加以反繫，而將之繫退，並繼續進繫，予以極大之打繫。又突入梅卡亞之日軍部隊，十七日下午三時，於該市東北方五公里之布連薩附近，包團携有裝甲車五輛約一百五十之敵，而將之殲滅，鹵獲裝甲車四輛，炸碎其他一輛，該方面之日軍部隊，自二十日夜，逐次復歸原狀。雙據守伊特闌勒斯（舊城內）之日軍，依然繼續强硬之防衛戰，並屢對敵軍加以挺身攻繫，同時東南方馬吉列兵營之日軍，亦對敵軍展開出血勇戰，茲敵軍仍企圖向貢尼剌增强兵力，彼等除於馬尼剌北方馬里芒那方面增强兵力外，並自馬尼剌地區南方亞卡方面向馬尼剌增援。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　中宋平原北部之戰局，近數日來無大變化，惟桑霍塞至沙爾中間地區，突破日本軍守備陣線，企圖迥迂桑霍塞日軍陣地後方之敵軍，於出動時　日軍反攻，予以痛烈打繫，向西方後退。聖多馬斯正面殆無變化，波索魯比奧正面之日軍，十六日對敵有力部隊反攻，與以相當損害，虛波及桑霍塞正面日軍，隨時對敵勇猛突繫，十六日夜亦炸毀其重榴砲一對，破環其物資倉庫數所，該方面之敵企圖預選迂迥日軍聖寒陣地之背面，摀亂日軍後方，但受日方猛攻，遂於十七日來開始後退。</p>
<p>菲島日軍對空監視部隊密切注意敵機活動</p>
<h3>東綫數百萬大軍　展開大决戰　南翼蘇軍抵尼芝河岸</h3>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫古本周圍布萊斯勞迤西之西普魯士，與波默拉尼亞境內之大戰，愈演愈烈，數百萬大軍之交戰，將進入新階段。蘇軍增强兵力，向克洛森。法蘭克福。庫斯特林方面進犯，情形尤爲緊張，目前戰事重心地點之沉寂，似爲大風雨前之一種現象。</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　德國社訊：西里西亞區，在最近二日內，已有二處焦點成立。其一在布萊斯勞之西，該處蘇電不斷增調步兵與砲兵編隊，向里森格培治（巨人山）前之德軍掩護砲隊緊迫，同時由南方向布萊斯勞堡壘進攻。第二戰事重心，係在勞本。哥里茲區，此處蘇軍擴充其大規模之戰鬥至尼芝河，蘇電已於星期三沿廣闊之戰綫，抵達該河，直至古本爲止。</p>
<p>東普魯士激戰德軍退出辛頓</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　德國社訊：星期三東普魯士一役，已展爲大規模之戰事，蘇機約二千架不斷協助陸軍作戰，蘇軍之子彈與戰其雖極優越，但於是日並無値得一提之勝利可言。蘇軍之主力編隊現正集中於布朗斯堡附近與辛頓區（Zinden）其他强大之蘇軍部隊則向薩姆蘭之德軍陣線猛攻，其目的顯然在於切斷康尼斯堡與海上之聯絡。辛頓市德軍經數小時激戰後，不得不向西撤退，當時該地完全化爲平地。布朗斯堡附近蘇軍，在汽車公路之兩旁，整日向東方與東北方進攻，該處展開坦克車大戰。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：昨夜莫斯科方面第二次承認蘇軍再自薩姆蘭半島撤退，蘇軍報稱，因大隊德軍反攻之後，蘇軍被迫由該灣北岸撤退。</p>
<h3>丹麥德軍　宣布戒嚴</h3>

<h3>國際棉業　諮詢委員會議　下月在美京舉行</h3>
<p>葡京二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：美國務院宣稱，國際棉業諮詢委員會，將於三月二十六日在華盛頓舉行第四次會議，該會成立於一九三九年九月，以檢討世界棉業問題爲目的。此次會議將研究各國棉業狀况及國際貿易問題，並提出建議以備各國之參考。</p>
<h3>國際貨幣合作　將作有效行動</h3>
<p>葡京二十三日中央社電　海通社訊，美京電：美商務部申稱，將根據勃勒登伍特會議關於國際貨幣合作之建議，作有效之行動。</p>
<h3>反軸心機襲德　繫落百餘架　西綫戰局無變化</h3>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　西綫反軸心空車於二十一日來襲柏林及萊因威斯特發里亞地區，並對溫約龍堡轟炸，德軍之制空部隊於該日畫夜繫落其一百十七架，大半爲四發重轟炸機，是役尤以德空軍夜間戰鬥機特爲活躍。</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：艾森霍華進攻德國北部之大攻勢是，迄未實現，加拿大第一軍在北翼，美第三軍在南實，而英第二軍三分之二及美第一軍與第九軍在西綫中部，迄未發揮戰力，空輸部隊一軍亦未參戰。德軍與英美軍之大戰尙未開始，英軍與加拿大軍在萊因河與繆斯河間使用壓力，迄未獲逞，美第三軍進展更緩，犧牲更重，而魯兩河前綫大攻勢之發動，亦遙訪無期矣，然艾森霍華或將另謀發展，亦未可知。</p>
<h3>德減少食糧配給</h3>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　德政府發表：爲確保四月份之食糧配給，特採取臨時揩置，暫將配給量减百分之十二·五。</p>
<h3>蘇聯攻德兵力　引起英美憂慮</h3>
<p>蘇聯紅軍於一月十二日大舉開始砲舊後，立刻由山道密爾資（Sandomierz）區展開空前未有的冬季大攻勢。這一點，由於德國一向深知蘇聯勢力雄厚，必能發動驚人攻勢，所以德國從容不迫地應付。聯合國在西線侵入德國領土的計劃，慘遭失敗，所以蘇聯紅軍方由東方浩蕩蕩大舉來犯，以求城下之盟。聯合國軍隊對德國軍隊的數量優勢，在所有戰塲上都充分表現出來，尤其在東線上表現得特別明顯。在此次蘇聯冬季攻勢尙未發動之前，按中立國軍事專家的估計，蘇聯的兵力如下：</p>
<p>蘇軍兵力</p>
<p>東普魯士國境地區—步兵二十至三十師，機甲部隊十師，砲兵十至二十團。</p>
<p>東普魯士至華沙地區—步兵二十師，機甲后二十師，砲兵十團。</p>
<p>華沙至波蘭南部地區—步兵四十師，機甲兵三十師，砲兵二十五團。</p>
<p>克拉科以及上西里西亞—步兵二十五至三十師，機甲兵二十師，砲兵二十團。</p>
<p>此外在捷克斯拉夫作戰中的畢德羅夫軍隊（第四鳥克蘭軍），擁有步兵十五師，機甲兵五師，砲兵兩團。洪牙利戰線上，另有步兵二十至西十師，機甲兵十至二十師，砲兵五團，以及投降蘇聯的羅洪軍隊，步兵約十師。對抗這樣雄厚的蘇聯軍隊，德軍僅有其五分之一，即或多說，充其量也不會超過二分之一。但德國在後方，却配有救援預備隊。據一般人估計，在奧得河畔的福蘭克福城駐有機甲二師，精銳兵二至三近衛師，尙有如此數目的國民擲彈兵。</p>
<p>政治暗鬥</p>
<p>此次蘇聯經軍空破德國戰線，乃是蘇聯軍事攻勢中，規模最大者。但最令人注意者，這次蘇聯的冬季攻勢，偏偏是與英美對德及對蘇發動政治政勢的時候。又加上聯合國在西線上，未能突破德國防線，但蘇聯紅軍却在東線上，又大獲勝利。</p>
<p>因此也可以說，蘇聯對於英美的政治攻勢，一反手而繫毀。蘇聯由於軍事上的成就，而在東歐，中歐，東南歐業已取得了廣大的勢力範團，但美國認爲蘇聯這樣迅速的發展，全是英國激起來的。現在英國對於波蘭，南斯拉夫，捷克斯拉夫，意大利，希臘等內部的糾紛，無法解決。英美嘡目咋舌地看着自己强大的冊盟國，在發揮着人所不能發揮的威力，只好對於蘇聯，甘拜下風。於是英美爲了限制蘇這種行爲，便不得不急謀召開英美蘇三巨頭會議。但最近東線上的蘇聯軍事發展，竟把英美過去那樣具有充分把握的樂觀心理，完全打破。</p>
<p>換言之，最初由於紅軍飛速的軍事成功，英美以爲戰爭即將結束，曾經歡天喜地，但現在却由高興變爲憂慮了。</p>
<p>蘇聯謀略</p>
<p>史太林採取這種閃電戰術，究竟有什麼企圖？史太林或許對付德國，也如對付其他歐洲各國一樣，要仲張蘇聯的勢力？</p>
<p>英美是這樣憂慮着。同時英美國內，還有許多人在指摘和非難西線作戰不能按照計劃進展。英美的與論界，必須早日突破德國防線。現實主義的史太林，看見英美手足失措於「被解放各國」的國內政治問題上，便認爲這是發動攻勢的最好機會。三國巨頭會議已經舉行，英差在自己這樣强大的同盟國面前，如不早日解決計多問題，則無法顯示自己的顏色。（方譯目一月三十日每日新聞瑞士通訊）</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>各大學生聯合義演　「富貴浮雲」今明義演　除預售榮譽劵外門票照售</h3>
<p>本市的翰，滬江，震旦，震女，復且，比較，交通，華東，大同，大夏，問德，南通，法商，德醫等十四大學學生，爲籌募本報讀者助學金，聯合義演舞台劇「富貴浮雲」，經兩個月的簿備，業經排練成熟。昨日上午十時綵排，成績非常美滿，決定今明兩日上午十時及下午七時假關心大戲院獻演，届時敬請各界贊助人士光臨指敎，以表謝忱。</p>
<p>這次各大學同學爲籌募助學金，聯合發起義演「富貴浮雲」，完全出於自動，排演及捐款兩方面所有工作也完全由各同學擔任，助學金辦事處只是略盡指導與督察的責任。本學期各校學費隨着物價暴漲，工商業却十分凋疲，因之本届助學金捐款最初不很踴躍。這種情形繳起了各校同學的自助互助精神。除了這次義演而外，特別勸募隊中有九十六隊完全是各校各學捐募的。最近由新兩報與男女靑年會聯合主辦的義賣市塲，也因爲各校同學的熱忱努力，成績出乎意料之外的圓滿。助金同學的學業成績曾於雨月前公開展覽，以供各界查考，本届義演義賣勸募工作可以說也是各界查考他們課外辦事精神的機會，這種活動對於他們自已也增加一種有價値的經騐。因爲時間短促，這次義演未能充分預備，但我們深館每一角色能按照劇本情節各盡所長，預示各校同學將來能對國家社會各有貢獻。參加義演義　勸募工作的並不限於助金同學，其他同學的熱忱努力更是値得欽佩的。</p>
<p>請注意掉票時間</p>
<p>凡持有榮譽券及普通券諸君，原定十七日下午二時，掉二十四日上午十時，十七日下午七時，掉二十四日下午七時。又十八日下午二時，掉二十五日上午十時，十八日下午七時，掉二十五日下午七時，茲爲減少麻煩起見，不必預定，隨到隨掉，是爲至要。</p>
<p>滬江學院得兩錦標</p>
<p>此次十四大學　聯合義演「富貴浮雲」，承蒙各界人仕熱心贊助，踴躍認捐，成績美滿。各校同學日夜奔波，推銷票券，精神至堪嘉佩，茲悉，十四大學中銷票成績最佳者爲滬江大學，共得一百二十萬元之鉅，榮獲團體錦標，個人銷票成績最優者一爲該校政治系學生裴惠珍小妣，共銷三十萬元。榮獲冠軍，又社會系學生張筱芳小姐，共得二十三萬元，屈居亞軍，一時傳爲佳話。</p>

<p>補償費移充助學金</p>
<p>林隱名君函云敬啓者，敝人於月初經手〇紙事，因前途違約，致失信於經叔平施永順二先生，使施先生　受損失，今蒙二君鑒諒外，復將補償與施先生中儲券二十萬元，如數退回，堅不接受，敝人內心實感且慚，今將該款以經施二光生名義，捐助貴報助學金及新聞報貸學金各十萬元，爲二先生造福，並謝其俠義精神。」</p>
<p>昨收助金</p>

<h3>昨晚籃球決賽　未有結果</h3>
<p>公開籃球聯賽，昨晚甲乙組兩支常勝軍東華中北會師決賽，不料於賽至最後八分鐘時，東華隊對裁判員王基恩之一次判決，認爲錯誤，加以責問，裁判員判決東華棄權，東華則聲明保留抗議權，比賽卒至不歡而散。昨晚東華一路領先，時比數爲三十比二十四分。共他女子組兩塲，三省勝華僑，二十七比十五，綠隊勝聯誼，五十四比十二分。</p>
<h3>宋徵殷油畫隨感</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>當前，人們似乎已經忘記了藝術，忘記了這作爲人類文化活動最高形態的藝術。我們看：上海畫壇是那麼的凋零，或許有一二次畫展零星地凑着熟鬧。但，一問其本質是如何呢？原來竟是凑些熱閙而已。</p>
<p>靑年畫家宋徵股油畫展，雖然並不如何使人注目，可是至少他不是像一般的凑熱鬧，他是在把硏究藝術的眞實的結果眞供出來，說明了他是如何硏究？又說明了他是硏究些什麼？</p>
<p>宋君全部出品約四五十點，包括人物，風景，靜物三種，作風傾向是非常新魚頭。但，新傾向，也許就是靑年畫家自溺的根由，這在宋君的藝術上，確不會有如此的危險，因爲，宋君在表現技術方面，是向多方面發展着，這是現代藝術的一般的特徵。</p>
<p>十年前，老友劉獅君，卒業日本大學藝術科，歸滬後，曾舉行個展，國人咸以其作品有現代藝術的一般特徵目之，近十年來，未聞繼起。今宋君亦卒業該校，於藝術風格如出一轍，若謂與劉君先後輝映國內畫壇，誰曰不宜。</p>

<p>改於三月十四日演出</p>

<h3>請持禮賢之義　優卹文士</h3>
<p>我國自戰事以來，全國文士，避居滬隅，於生活困難中，瀕於山窮水盡一之境者，不乏其人。是輩皆以畢生精力，盡瘁學術，實爲國家之　實，民族之精魂，巍然如魯殿靈光，　學人所宗仰；而乃瓶　　恥，　釜生　！念我滬上不少富厚畏者，深願雅慕衛公子友致　於子思子之高風，對於此等文士，持禮賢之義·優加供養，按時爲薪粟之饋，俾紓生活之憂煎，而安心於研幾箸述。若然，則豈特受供養者個人之私幸，崇學術，敦風俗，國家民族之前途，實利賴之！（黃警頑）</p>

<h3>加當煉奶義賣　濟助慈幼協會</h3>
<p>中華慈幼協會，去年舉行慕款運動，結果尙稱美滿，惟因物價激漲，支出浩繁，對於目前留養三百餘名難童之給養，仍有難以爲繼之勢。茲有趨超君者，幼幼爲懊，特將自食之苞米粉兩包計四百斤，捐作該會難童糧食外，並將其公子等所節省之加當煉奶四十八聽，舉行義賣，最低標價七萬二千元，（每聽以一千五百元計算）以售款所得，悉數濟助慈幼協會經費，俾宏救濟之效。據起超君意見，該項煉奶係海寗洋行出品，十三兩半聽裝，照目前市價每聽一千六百八十元，購者旣不吃虧，復寓極有意義之善舉，海屬一舉兩得。想必有熱心人士樂成此事，常不負起超君一番苦心也。（購者可向該會接洽，電話八二二七三）。</p>

<h3>疏散人口問題</h3>
<p>— 金雄白</p>
<p>關於疏散上海人口問題，無論在減少空襲的危害，或者對於上海市內食糧的供應與治安之維持上講，均爲當務之急。市政府旣已決定組織疏散委員會，專職辦理，市政諮詢委員也將以全力協助其成，那麼綱舉目張，在緊近期內，一定可以按步就班的順利做去。</p>
<p>這一次決定的疏散　法，以出於自動爲原則。當然如養老院育堂殘廢院等等之慈善　關，決無留滬的必要者，應富在强迫疏散之列，那麼第一步所謂自動疏散的居民，其總數究有若干？我們現在僅憑臆斷，知道願意離滬的實在不少，而確數則猶無從統計。辦理疏散，不特是一件艱鉅的工作，而且需要的經費也太多。假使第一步的人數不能確定，一旦着手實行，心將感到許多困難。所以我主張首先應當立即辦理登記人數，回鄕的地點，能够確定以後，經費的籌措和交通工具的準備，纔能澈底解決。至於辦理登記的機關，我想各同鄕會和市民福利協會等團體，都是養不容辭的。</p>
<p>第二，在辦理疏散人口以前，大家都注意於交通問題。工具的困難，辦理的不善，流氓地痞與不消員管的勒索，固然都將影響工作的進行，確是一個嚴重的問題。但我認爲這還不是最受威脅的問題，因爲以市府曁全體市民的力量，在現環境下，還足以打破這一個難關。如其疏散人口，祇在帮助其如何能够得車票船票，和如何護送他們上車上船，那我們的疏散工作，已先確定了失敗之根源。某一種居民，因爲感到將來或許有某一種危險的降臨，想離開上海，他自己有資力，同時交通上自己也有辦法的，當然不在我們工作範圍以內。我們的工作對象，一部份他家鄕還有產業或工作可以維持生計的，或者本人在上海做事而擬把眷屬遺送回去的，他所需要帮助的僅僅是交通問題；第二類是在滬不能生活，而又無家可歸的。前一類的疏散，比較輕而易舉，祗要做到交通問題的解決；後一類的居民就麻煩了，川資的籌措，疏散地點的選擇，到達後生活的維持，及管理的注意，不但需要很多錢，很長時問，尤其需要可靠而幹練負責的辦事人才。</p>
<p>時機一天一天的急迫，我們應該立即決定，立即實行，等到不得不疏散的時候，再着手辦理，或許會嫌太遲了。</p>
<p>疏散人口問題特輯</p>
<h3>對於疏散人口之芻見</h3>
<p>— 陳日平</p>
<p>上海自開港後，因地理上之關係，成爲我國經濟金融之中心，且因已往頻年內亂，內地居民遷移而來者日多，儼然視爲安居樂業之所，人口遞增，乃至五百萬人之衆。</p>
<p>自中日事變發生於前，歐洲及大東亞戰爭相繼於後，海外交通，頓形梗塞。當茲梗塞。當茲戰事日趨劇烈之際，各地往來更來更覺阻滯阻滯。本市原爲工商業地區，糧食供應，胥賴各方，萬一交通斷絕，糧運不濟，因而形成種種嚴重狀態，自在逆料之中。故本市疏散人口問題，已爲當今所急需解決者。市政府有鑒及此，特設人口疏散委員會，積極推行其事；第疏散工作，實非易舉，茍無周詳計劃，縝密準備，不足盡其全功。竊有數點，實有首加考慮之必要，謹列於次：</p>
<p>（一）關於容納地區者：</p>
<p>甲，治安之確保；</p>
<p>乙，糧食之確保；</p>
<p>丙，生產事業之便利。</p>
<p>容納地區之治安，首須加以注意，否則一再搬遷，民心固不勝跋涉之勞，而官方實亦不勝其煩。同時該地區之糧食，是否易於採運，誠恐此地之問題，甫吿解決，而彼處之問題，相繼而生，似菲萬全之道。其次被疏散者，終日游閒，亦堪隠憂，果能和此等人力於生產事業方面，於公於私，兩有裨益；故該地區之生產事業，是否便利，亦應注意及之。</p>
<p>（二）關於交通工具者：</p>
<p>甲，鐵略；</p>
<p>乙，河道；</p>
<p>兩，其他畫輛。</p>
<p>交通工具，爲疏散時所必備者，如何準備，實應妥爲計議，善爲連絡，否則事倍而功半，尤難望迅收效果。</p>
<p>（三）疏散程序：</p>
<p>甲，有資力而有辦法者應自行收散；</p>
<p>乙，向由慈善救濟團體取養者，由該團體請求疏取委員會設法；</p>
<p>丙，有資力而無辦法者，應請求疏散委員會設法；</p>
<p>丁，無資力而欲疏散者，應向同鄕會或其也公益慈善團體請求設法；</p>
<p>戊，一般老弱婦孺，應由各同鄕會或保甲處勸導疏散；</p>
<p>已，無職業又無一定住所者，由政府設法疏散之。</p>
<p>（四）詳細辦法：</p>
<p>詳細辦法，應由各同鄕會公益慈善團體保甲處與人口疏散委員會商訂之。</p>
<p>以上種種，聊就管見所及，舉以貢獻市政當局之揣測考，並備關心本市疏散人口問題者之硏討。</p>
<h3>疏散的先决條件</h3>
<p>— 朱公明</p>
<p>本月五日報報羅秘書長談話，對於疏散本市人口，謂政府已決定成立人口疏散委員會，積極進行。足見寵謀碩劃，所見深遠。觀乎近日形勢，事有迫不容緩之概，若由市民自動疏散，勢必因循坐誤，自難達到政府預定疏散一百萬人之計劃。因爲市民心理，大率茍且偸安，每有事非臨頭不心急之况，欲其自動疏散，必至遷延遺誤，成效殊尠。應由政府出面作積極之督促與勸導，使老弱婦孺及不必要之人員，早日疏散至各地，以免變起不測，徒多犧甡。</p>
<p>其次則爲予疏散者以便利問題：目前行旅者對於車站碼頭兩個難關，眞是長之如虎。現在上海北六之黑暗情形，經整頓後，漸見改善；然不知輪船碼頭，也暗無天日，更有甚於車站者，除船票非黑市難以買劉外，凡一行李到埠，必經三四層之敲索，及至搬入輪內，不論箱篋綱籃，每件非費數千元不可，甚至有萬元以上者，以一行李上輪，勒索如是之多，其黑賠狀况，已可想見。對於此種輪船碼頭紅白帽子等非法行爲，自然應予改善。</p>
<p>對於疏散市所帶行李，似應寬予限制。大凡市民回鄕，其日常應用物件，際此物價高漲之時，每不欲在此充置而回鄕另辦，尤以婦女爲甚，即一零頭寸布，亦必携回鄕里，不肯放棄，復以鄕間物資缺乏，如棉布，毛巾，洋機，肥皂，火柴等類，因恐鄕間缺乏，勢必略予備帶；然是類物品，均經統制，每見碼頭檢查，有多帶兩條毛巾或兩雙洋襪者即被取出沒收，是等限制過嚴，亦爲疏散者所苦一事。若子女衆多之家庭或多年未經回鄕者，所携日用品備作自用及餽送親友者，往往數量超過限制，在携帶者心理尙感所携之不敷應用，實際上帶兩條毛巾兩雙洋襪就要被沒收，又如棉布衣料等物，依限制額每人似可携帶三碼，實際上恐一碼也難携出。若以需要論，男袍料需一丈三尺，女袍料需九尺，在疏散回鄕者心理，以今日回鄕，不知何日返滬，帶一件衣料回鄕，亦屬人情之常，然一件衣料已超出三碼限制之額，依法可予沒收。又如一家六口同時回鄕，其所帶衣料，是否可以依照限額合併携帶十八碼，在事實上亦成同問題。故對疏散市民回鄕者携帶行李，似應予以放寬限制。</p>
<p>凡疏散回鄕市民，事前必須向所轄之警察局登記，警局除予登記外，應即籨發回鄕證或「疏散證」，並將疏散人口名單每日彙送疏散委員會，以便分配交通工具，另將名單一分，分送物品配給處，以便停止配給。在疏散委員會接到警局所送名單後，即按登記之先後與夫疏散之路綫，及請求之交通工具，予以合理之支配。在疏散者則不致無舟車可乘之苦，面當局亦可洞悉各路疏散之情形及疏散之總數。在回鄕證「或疏散證」內，除填明姓名性別年籍及所往路綫所帶行李件數等事外，並應註明沿途警憲應予優待保護，不得留難等字樣。一面由市政府另行分別函咨各地警憲機關，對於是項疏數回鄕人民，予以切實保護。</p>
<p>再次則爲增加交通工具，除京滬滬杭兩路火車曁外海長江各綫輪船應予增加班次船隻外，對於內河汽路長途汽車，亦應設法增加。此外則更應利用民船獻車，大事擴充，務使疏散市民，不致有欲去不能，擁塞難行苦。其他如限制單帮之佔用交通工具及取黑市售票等問題，亦在整頓交通工具項目之內，一併予以解決。</p>
<p>至於减輕疏散市民之舟車票價，及補助貧苦市民無力回鄕者之川旅等問題，亦屬重要。倘市府當局曁有關方面，能將上述各節，予以合理解決，預料政府當局疏散百萬市民的計劃，不難達到。</p>
<h3>關於人口疏散問題</h3>
<p>— 魯風</p>
<p>戰時的上海，人口有過多之忠。目前隨着戰局的進展，一切運輸。生產的力量，都受者限制，然而消費者並未減少。在求過於供的狀態之下，物價高漲，民生不安，這多量的人口聚居上海，非特無補於生產，而且對治安也不無影響。加之上海不進遭受空襲，則人口的疏散問題，實爲當務之急。</p>
<p>市府緊近組織人口疏散委員會，正在集思廣益，討論萬全的對策。本人以爲關於產這一個問題，應先加考慮者，有下列幾個要點。</p>
<p>（一）考慮運輸機構的暢達</p>
<p>（二）採取一勞永逸的集體疏散</p>
<p>（三）對無居住上海必要者加以嚴格的抉剔</p>
<p>（四）講求疏散人口的生活對策</p>
<p>一，目前運輸機構的種種限制，使人有旅途維艱之感。加以黑市橫行，正當必要的旅行尙感不便，故輪及疏散上海的人口，非儘量强化運輸力量，則一切無從進行。</p>
<p>二，如慈善團體，學校，宗敎集團，工塲之類，均應適當考慮遷出市外，當局應協助其疏散，並予以種種便利。</p>
<p>三，並無正當職業之遊民，應加嚴格抉剔，實行疏散市外。</p>
<p>四，上項强制疏散之人民，倘在市外不能謀生，或並無新友援助進，應求其遷出後之對策，目前參戰中國之政策，以增加生產爲要務，則不妨考慮成立輕工業等生產機構，俾疏出之人口可以工作而生活，不致坐以待斃。</p>
<p>當然，要使擁有居民三百餘萬的上海人口實旋疏散，除圓滑運用各種機構外，大量經濟的支出，以補助疏散人口的消耗，亦屬必要。茲事體大，要必集思廣益，由各當局及專家硏究，釐訂萬全辦法，以謀付諸實行也。</p>
<h3>疏散機構之組織及工作</h3>
<p>— 趙一山</p>
<p>戰時都市人口疏散之重要性，已引起方面之注意。筆者從港返滬，港地疏散人口，約全占港人口半數，經當局組織疏散機構—歸鄕指導事務所，工作以來，頗著成效。因此疏散人口，必須先行設立一健全組織，爲指導疏散工作之機構，方能按步進行，以達預預見期成績。茲就筆者所知，港地「歸鄕指導事務所」組織工作概况，參入本人之意見，草擬上海市歸鄕指導事務所大綱如後。</p>

<p>經費分政府公費，本身收入，鐘募捐助三種。</p>
<h3>爲何要疏散人口</h3>
<p>— 顧南羣</p>
<p>我一向不大會說話，更不會寫文章，所以很少說話，更少寫文章。這回，申報來函索文，只好站在自己的職業立塲上寫幾句：</p>
<p>我是一個醫生，三句話不離本行，只得根據本身職業的經驗說幾句關於疏散人口的話。</p>
<p>疏散人口，在此時此地，實在太需要了。情勢所趨，固然是主要，但是由於戰爭所引起的有關切身的衣食住行之困難，也應當儘速疏散。</p>
<p>爲什麼呢？戰爭時期內，一切相當限制，衣食住行，也不能例外。衣行兩點，因篇幅關係，而且也在筆者所習範圍之外，不用多說，這裏，僅拿有關本職的食住兩項來說，也應該趕快疏散。</p>
<p>第一在這個時期內，物價勢必逐步飛漲，生活也就日益困難，大多數市民求溫飽尙且不可得，要講營餐，更談不上，因此大多數人就造成營餐不良。營養不良，就易生疾病，不如到鄕問去，比較易於獲得。這是就食的方面說，應該趕快疏散的第一個理由。</p>
<p>第二是住宿問題，由於本市一部份房屋燬於戰火，尙未恢復至戰前的規模，而人口反而較前增多，因此，除少數屋子沒有幾個人居住外，大多屋子，都擁擠非凡，在這種情形之下，空氣旣渾濁，疾病就隨之而生。這據我們南洋醫院的統計，近年來的染傳及急病之死亡率，比前更高，由百份之二。三增至百份之五强。雖然不一定全確，也可以推知，鄕村空氣比較新鮮，衛生設備，雖不完全，好多人塞在一個小屋的情形，是很少很少的，除非連一片瓦沒有的赤貧者。這是應該趕快疏散的第二個理由。</p>
<p>第三要說到近代科學戰爭爆炸物的殺傷力了。大家都知道：現代戰爭非常慘酷，根據報章雜誌上吿訴我們，歐洲好幾個大都市被轟炸之情形，簡直太可怕了。就拿我們耳聞目覩的來報吿一下，也够驚心動魄的了。大約在去年十五月吧，舊八區前貝勒路附近一個鐵舖子裏的工人，爲了誤認收買來的炸彈爲舊鐵塊，一繫之下發生爆炸，當時受重傷的有十餘人之多，送到我們南洋醫院來醫治。有的被炸得皮開肉爛，有的四肢不全，有的遍體灼焦，其中因受傷過重，不久死去的三人，至於受傷較輕，治愈後成殘廢者，也有二三人。這種情境，我相信本市市民，決不會因未曾身受而忽視吧！但這僅是小小的炸彈，比這些更厲害，更無呢的高空轟炸之殺傷率，當然更不堪設想；甚至其殺傷力，有時竟會超越我們醫生醫治按能之外的程度。這是應該趕快疏散的第三個理由。</p>
<p>以上三點，只要我們靜靜地想像一下，離開本市，實在太迫切，太需要了。完全避離戰爭的波動，固然不可能，但鄕間較都市爲安全，這是不可否認的事實，我竭誠向一般認爲沒有多大必要留在本市的同胞忠吿，趕快儘可能離開本市！古諺吿訴我們：「小亂住城，大亂住鄕」，這是在兵　戰火所造成的血的敎訓中體騐出本的明哲保身的訓諺，願全市同胞趕快度情自處。</p>
<h3>洞庭山爲滬民疏散區議</h3>
<p>— 項康原</p>
<p>上海市的人口，過度密集，不特當戰事緊張時期，在防空上有疏散之需要，即以米根燃料兩項價格的突飛猛漲情形而論，亦有勸導一部份機關及戶口移往別處就食的必要。現在市政府爲執行疏散事宜，已組織委員會專司其事。鄙人僅就管見所及，略貢芻蕘，以資商榷：</p>
<p>我們可以推想得出有一部份市民的老家，原在隣近的省市者，都願意遷回老家去；因爲依普通情形而論，大概如個人家在其原籍地方，親成朋友及資產給養，聯繫總較客地爲密。如果遷回老家，一切比較省事。這輩市民，只須由市政當局予以交通工具方面之協助，就可欣然就這，並無其他問題，所以辦理比較容易。但是另有一部份市民，原籍就在上海，或原籍很遠，無法歸鄕，或原籍雖在隣近，但因另有別種困難，不能回去者，則市政當局除代解決交通工具外，另須再爲代籌移往的去處，以資安頓。現在吾提出吳縣洞庭西山作爲這輩人疏散地點，特申述理由及辦法如次：</p>
<p>甲。洞庭山的環境：洞庭山屬吳縣管轄，孤持太湖中，土地肥沃，民風秀懸。因與大陸隔離，故戰火不易波及，不特在戰時爲理想之避難處所，即在承平時期，亦不失爲優美之住居地區。出產水果茶葉魚蝦菜蔬甚富，且與吳縣縣城相距不遠，故糧食供應，也很便利。本山及隣近地方，竹木富饒，如欲建搭簡單之房屋，以容納移往之人民，則材料一項，儘可就地取組，極爲便易。太湖沿岸，盛產盧葦。故山民日用燃料，可取之無窮。</p>
<p>洞庭山目前最大的缺點，是漢安沒有保障。但吾想事在人爲，如果移民財力充份，組織嚴密，則山上及湖中伏莽，不啻耀疥之患，下難指日加以肅清的。英國人書年關發香港，就是很好的榜樣。</p>
<p>乙，移往洞庭山的辦法：本市疏散人口委員會應從速與吳縣縣政府及上海的洞庭山同鄕會取得聯絡，先在西山調查可供住居的房屋，估計可以移往的人數，規定每人人納費的數額（第一批假定爲每人五十萬元）。然後公吿市民，凡願意疏散上山者，往指定地點，申請登記。假定第一批移往者十萬人後，即由吳縣縣政府特組洞庭山管理局（或即由該山的區公署改組擴大亦可），負責整理山上的民政。例如支配住屋，配給糧食，保障治安等等，先把該山闢爲可供良民安居樂業的區域，然後登記市民方可放心前往，高枕無憂</p>
<p>目前陸路交通工具的取得，較水路更爲困難；茲幸由滬上山，可僱用專用小輪拖帶民船前往，故運輸問題，不難解決。沿途並應由稅警團派員武裝護送，以策安全。俟第一批十萬人上山之後，再決定第二次疏散市民前往。以後賡續舉辦，俟山上人口達到飽和點爲止。但吾們認爲第二次及以後各次上山者的納費數額，似應分批遞减，俾力薄者亦可享此權利。尙有一部份團體和人口，經市府認爲必須强迫遷離本市者，則甚至不特可予免費疏散，即予以貼費上山，也是應該的。這種辦法，無異使力薄者可偕力厚者的光，也有享受遷往該山的機會；僅力厚者在疏散的程序上，略占優先而已。</p>
<p>丙，洞庭山的民政：山上民政，應採用相當程度的自治制度。在管理局之外，似應由山民另組民政協義會，規定某貢政治應經協議會事先審核同意，方可執行；某種設施應由協議會協助管理局共同負責，尤其是警衛一項，除應保持雄厚的常備隊外，更應由山民積極參加調練，發揮自衛力量，庶軍民聯絡，呼應靈活，在防守上易收宏效。</p>
<p>財政爲一切事業的原動力，開閣洞庭西山作爲滬民移殖區域，自應以議有雄厚的財源爲前提，舉凡淸除伏莽，整理道路，添建民房，維持警衛力量等等，都須有鉅額的經費，方可舉辦。上文擬定上山滬民須先納費每人五十萬元，首批十萬人，總數已達五百萬萬苑，再加以後賡續上山各批所繳的費用，數額似已覺十分龐大；但衡以整理治安等所需費用之浩繁，似乎又非有此足以成事。</p>
<p>滬民遷往該山以後之生計問題，亦應預爲籌及。除大部依靠自己的財產，或仰賴別處匯款的接濟外，管理局似不妨劃定相當的空地，招民承租，俾可種植果樹或菜蔬以供本山的食用；如果收穫繁茂，交通有辦法，則不妨販往別處售賣，以換取糧食。此外凡有特殊技能者，如學醫科者，可縣壺應診；學敎育者，可開辦學校；精懋遷者，可經營隣近各地與本山的貿易等等。都可盡其所能，得其所需。</p>
<p>總之，開闢洞庭山，移殖上海市民的計劃，相當複雜而艱鉅；但由官民全作進行，持以毅力，則不難於短期內促其實現。吾們經營該山，切不可作爲戰時避雖的權宜揩置，而應抱定百年大計的方針，即本承平以後，更應繼續經營，發揚光大，造成太湖中風景秀麗的住宅區，以與外人經營的政浪嶼，牯嶺，莫干山先後輝映，則目下所耗費的人力財力，豈是徒然的呢？</p>

<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – In order to consolidate wartime transportation in the rear and ensure the safety of cargo and luggage, the Ministry of Construction believes that theft of railway equipment, passenger luggage, and other goods should be subject to special punishment depending on the circumstances, given the importance of wartime transportation.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes Various Important Cases</h3>

<h3>Four Enemy Planes Attacked Nanjing, Two Were Shot Down</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – American P51 type aircraft stationed in Chongqing, totaling four, intruded into the airspace over the Nanjing area twice on the 23rd, in the morning and afternoon. They were intercepted by the Japanese Air Force in aerial combat, and two of them were shot down. Thanks to the activity of the air defense forces, the enemy planes gained nothing and fled.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Night-Raided Zhijiang Airport</h3>
<p>Continental Front Base, 23rd (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 21st, a Japanese elite bomber squadron attacked the enemy airfield in Zhijiang, Hunan Province, and bombs hit two small planes on the ground, which caught fire and burned. There were also two major explosions. The entire Japanese squadron returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>Five American Experts Left Chongqing to Return to Their Country</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing broadcast on the 21st, five American technical experts from the Chongqing Wartime Production Bureau suddenly resigned and returned to their country. The establishment of the Production Bureau was based on the advice of the United States. The high expectations for these technical experts when they first joined the Bureau were not difficult to imagine. Now, they have retreated halfway, indicating the extent to which they could not cooperate with the staff in Chongqing. Therefore, there will inevitably be various disputes in the Wartime Production Bureau in the future.</p>
<h3>The Morale of the Japanese Rear Is Extremely High: Ambassador Tani's Talk with Reporters</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masazane, met with a group of reporters in Shanghai at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 23rd), explaining the policies towards China that were decided upon during his recent return to Japan, and strongly stated that the morale of the Japanese people in the rear is extremely high. He finally hoped that the Japanese people in China would unite and rise up. The content of the talk is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sufficient Strength to Promote the War</p>
<p>During my return to Tokyo this time, I was most deeply impressed by the increasingly high morale of the people in the rear and the fact that Japan still has sufficient strength to advance the war. Enemy planes are bombing the Japanese mainland, and robberies are frequent. The rear has long become the front, but they are used to it. As soon as they see enemy planes, they feel that the war is close to their side. Officials and civilians cooperate with each other, and today it has developed into a comrades-in-arms bond. Therefore, regardless of enemy air raids, increased production is not hindered in the slightest, so that the mobilization of domestic resources still leaves a considerable degree of strength. From this point, it can be recognized that Japan still has sufficient ability to conduct operations in the future. The enemy is disregarding bloodshed and forcibly carrying out landing operations, attempting to destroy Japan's war-making capabilities, but their purpose is feared to be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Implementing Economic Measures for China</p>
<p>The economic measures for China decided in Tokyo this time are not innovative, but merely to quickly implement what has not been implemented in the past, in order to adapt to the needs of the war situation. The main content is the integrated operation of local agencies in a three-in-one manner, and strengthening the rapid connection with Tokyo.</p>
<p>The Director-General of General Affairs of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Ando, came to China the other day and held a meeting of embassy and office directors in Nanjing to discuss issues related to prices, currency, production, and transportation. In short, the sole objective is to rapidly promote the local war effort. Director-General Ando has a deep understanding of the local economic situation, and it is expected that he will be able to achieve the intended purpose of the economic measures in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding Maintaining the Value of Savings Certificates</p>
<p>Regarding maintaining the value of the currency, there are two kinds of countermeasures, active and passive. The former includes increasing production, withdrawing currency, and issuing securities, while the latter includes emergency measures such as the price countermeasures implemented this time. However, in order to maintain the value of savings certificates, the ratio of 18 yen to 100 yuan of savings certificates has always been firmly adhered to, and concrete countermeasures are being gradually promoted at the same time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarine Sinks Enemy Cruiser in Philippine Waters</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A Japanese submarine, which has been demonstrating its fierce power in the vicinity of the Philippines, sank a large enemy cruiser in the Mindoro Sea on the 21st. At 10:30 AM that morning, a submarine commanded by Chief Petty Officer Matsuda discovered a fleet composed of two large enemy cruisers, several cruisers, and dozens of destroyers and transport ships sailing in the Mindoro Sea. It immediately charged in. At approximately 11:30 AM, a Japanese torpedo hit a large enemy 10,000-ton class cruiser. The enemy ship's forward magazine exploded in flames, and before long, the entire ship sank.</p>
<h3>The Central Government Emphasizes Streamlining Administration and Formulates Various Measures to Simplify Procedures such as Changing Organizations</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – In order to adapt to wartime needs and emphasize methods of simplifying government administration, the central authorities have approved two principles at the 64th National Defense Council meeting. First, in the future, the procedures for changing the organization of various central government organs and their subordinate organs, such as determining principles and amending articles (including abolitions, mergers, and new establishments), should be streamlined. Second, in the future, when various ministries, commissions, and departments of the Executive Yuan increase fees, fines, and penalties for matters under their jurisdiction in order to meet needs and simplify procedures, they should first submit the principles for increasing fees to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion and then submit them to the Central Political Committee for approval. As for relevant laws and regulations, the relevant ministries, commissions, and departments should amend them based on the approved principles and then submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval or record without submitting them to a meeting or forwarding them to the Central Political Committee. However, those that should be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation should still be handled by the Executive Yuan as usual. Regarding the first item, four specific measures are proposed as follows:</p>
<p>Four Measures for Changing Organizations</p>
<p>(1) When the organization of various Yuan and directly subordinate organs of the National Government is to be changed, the principles should first be submitted to the Central Political Committee for approval. The laws and regulations related to the organization should be amended by the organ based on the approved principles and then submitted to the Central Political Committee for transmittal to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation without being submitted to a meeting of the Central Political Committee. (2) When the organization of various ministries and departments of the Executive Yuan is to be changed, the principles should be deliberated together with the amended organization law at a meeting of the Executive Yuan, and the principles should be submitted to the Central Political Committee for approval. The amended organization law should be directly transmitted by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation without being submitted to the Central Political Committee.

<h3>Guo Pei Writes an Article on the European Crisis: Germany Resolves to Fight to Complete Its Historical Mission</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency message, Dr. Goebbels published an article in the German weekly, the main points of which are as follows: Although Stalin did not think about publicly announcing his plan in the past, his 200 million slaves are now working hard to realize his plan. Stalin dreams that the future world will be under the dictatorial rule of the Moscow International. Although there has been an agreement between Roosevelt and Churchill, if the Germans lay down their weapons, the Soviet Union will occupy all of Eastern and Southeastern Europe and most of Germany. Then, even if this vast area is isolated, it will engage in large-scale massacres of its people. The Jewish newspapers in London and New York may praise it. In the future, Britain will be less able to carry out European and world policies that represent its own interests. In 1948, President Roosevelt will be defeated in the election, and the Republican isolationists will be elected as president. Their first move will probably be to withdraw American troops from Europe. This move will be praised by the entire American people. In this war, Britain has been forced to abandon its 200-year-old balance of power policy and recognize a world power in Europe. This power will never stop until it includes Britain in its dictatorial scope. Four weeks before the outbreak of this war, the German leader proposed adjusting British-German foreign policy. Germany should respect Britain's sea power, Britain should respect Germany's land power, and air power should be equal. The two countries should jointly guarantee world peace. If this were the case, communism would not spread. Now communism has come to the Varta River. Whether it can be stopped depends entirely on the resistance of the German army. This is the situation of the war. The communique of the Yalta Conference has failed to change it. All we have is our strength and ideals. We will never give them up. This is a prerequisite for our survival and the completion of our historical mission.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsushima Explains the Battle of Iwo Jima: The Enemy American Forces Suffered Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>The Allied Japanese Fleet News Department held a regular briefing yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Minister Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and trustees Toshio Hayashi, Saka Tsume, Wang Bingnan, and Liu Zhennan, as well as reporters from various newspapers, attended. Minister Matsushima gave a speech, explaining in detail the Battle of Iwo Jima and the losses of the enemy Americans in the Pacific. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Forces on Iwo Jima Strongly Intercept the Enemy</p>
<p>On February 16th and 17th, powerful American mobile units appeared in the sea south of Tokyo. Their air units bombed the Japanese airfields south of Kanto. At the same time, they carried out the Battle of Iwo Jima. The total number of enemy planes during the air raids was 1,000 on the 16th and more than 500 on the 17th. The Japanese side had prepared for the enemy's bombing in advance. Under the air force interception, more than 300 enemy planes were shot down, and the Japanese side suffered very little damage. The American fleet was commanded by Spruance. It consisted of a large number of battle cruisers and aircraft carriers, and it mobilized a large air force from the Mariana Islands. However, the war results obtained by the enemy were very small. When the enemy attacked Iwo Jima, they used a powerful fleet to cover the landing of their Fourth and Fifth Army Corps. They encountered strong interception from the Japanese side. Their hard battle was unprecedented in this war. The number of American landing troops was approximately 30,000. As of the 21st, the losses were already over 10,000 people and 25 or 26 ships. The magnitude of the enemy's losses can be imagined, while the Japanese army has always firmly defended its main positions. By the 22nd, the enemy's personnel losses had reached 12,000 people. In order to replenish its forces, it landed another division. In an area of only 300 yards, the enemy fought hard and suffered great losses, and their morale was greatly demoralized. Their commander ordered "anyone who flees from the battle will be executed immediately." The Japanese army calmly responded to the battle, using the air force and land forces to cooperate in the attack.</p>
<p>Landing Enemy Forces Suffer Heavy Losses</p>
<p>After the enemy Americans began landing at the southern end of Iwo Jima, they divided their forces into two groups to attack. One group attacked the central area, and the other group attacked Mount Suribachi to the west. However, their progress was only two hundred yards. On the sea, they used submarines to attack the enemy, so the enemy Americans suffered unprecedented heavy losses. According to statistics, the damage is as follows: As of the 21st, the enemy Americans suffered 12,000 personnel losses on land and 8,500 personnel losses at sea, averaging 5,000 personnel losses per day on land and 200 personnel losses per hour. The area of Iwo Jima is 32 square kilometers, and the enemy occupied 10 kilometers. Their loss for every kilometer occupied was 1,200 people. Therefore, the degree of damage to the enemy in this battle was even greater than in the past battles of Gilbert, Makin, and Tarawa. The air force that attacked Tokyo, after completing the air raid, still flew back to the sea east of Iwo Jima to replenish supplies. However, due to the excessive damage to its mobile units, it could not replenish them and reduced its activity.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces in the Philippines Carry Out a Surprise Attack</p>
<p>In the Philippines, the enemy Americans, with the 37th Division and the 1st Cavalry Division, jointly attacked Manila. After the 14th, the Japanese army launched a surprise attack from the northern part of Manila. By the 17th, they had suppressed the enemy's main forces at the Barmagan and Quezon airfields and rushed into the city of Manila, making contact with the local Japanese army and navy. This move was completely unexpected by the enemy Americans, and the American army fell into a state of confusion. Therefore, the defense of Manila has now been reversed, and the enemy Americans are gradually in a position to be annihilated. Therefore, the American side has been quite silent about the war in the Philippines recently, which is generally considered strange. It is because they suffered a major blow from this surprise attack that they were unable to say anything.</p>
<p>Enemy Propaganda Has a Different Purpose</p>
<p>At present, the Japanese army in the Pacific is at the stage of launching a major offensive. We are grateful for the courageous and hard fighting of the soldiers on the front lines, and we are especially grateful for the various cooperation in China to complete this Greater East Asia War. Now, the ability of the enemy Americans to fight has reached its highest point. Their Secretary of War Stimson recently said: If the United States cannot replenish the front-line forces in a rapid and appropriate manner, then there is no way to fight the war. Its urgency can be seen. Also, in the midst of this tense war situation, the enemy has repeatedly propagated that the Japanese army has massacred Filipinos and Javanese in the Philippines and New Guinea. In fact, these are all false propagandas. The purpose of their propaganda is nothing more than to arouse the people's resistance to Japan and to create an excuse for killing people when landing on the Chinese mainland or the Japanese mainland in the future. In the past, some people in China predicted that Japan would inevitably fail in the Greater East Asia War. This kind of concept should be corrected urgently.</p>
<p>Unfounded Rumors Are Completely Untenable</p>
<p>Yesterday, a friend came to Shanghai from Tokyo and talked about the past rumors that the Omura area of Kyushu, Japan (near Sasebo), had been repeatedly bombed by enemy B29 type aircraft and had been razed to the ground, and that the streets were difficult to distinguish. Some Japanese people also believed in this kind of rumor. Now, according to what they have seen, it is completely untrue. As for the so-called aircraft bombing, no one knows where the bombs fell, and there has not been any change in the local area. It can be seen that rumors are not credible. Also, the enemy Americans used as many as 600 warships and boats to attack Iwo Jima recently, but from the 19th when they landed to the 21st, the progress was only 200 yards. In the past, some people in Shanghai overestimated the strength of the enemy Americans, which is completely wrong and should be urgently corrected.</p>
<p>The German Military and Civilians Will Fight to the End</p>
<p>Regarding the European war situation, the German army is fully demonstrating its intention to counterattack the Soviet army, which has advanced to the vicinity of Berlin. There are fierce counterattack battles in Königsberg, Stettin, Frankfurt, and its south. The Western Front is also conducting a strong counterattack against the British and American forces. The German military and civilians are embracing the spirit of fighting to the end and fully demonstrating their combat capabilities. If China and Japan can cooperate to the end, it will be easy to defeat the British and Americans and protect East Asia.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the Dispersal of Industry</h3>
<p>Modern warfare is total war. Whether at the front lines or behind them, whether producers or transporters, all are part of the entire war system. Therefore, destroying the enemy's production facilities and hindering their transportation are crucial steps in combat. Currently, the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. Enemy air raids are inevitable, and Shanghai is an important base in the rear. Thus, Shanghai's industry and surrounding transportation are likely to be targets of enemy air raids. This is the first thing that should be noted.</p>
<p>Dispersal efforts are being planned and implemented. Relying solely on persuasion cannot overcome the inertia of the general public. In the future, forced dispersal may be implemented when necessary, but this is not a thorough solution. Analyzing the reasons why the general public remains in Shanghai, the majority do so because of their jobs, believing it difficult to live if they leave Shanghai. Therefore, resolving the issue of employment after dispersal is the second thing that should be noted.</p>
<p>In the future, transportation will become increasingly difficult. As a result, the exchange of agricultural products needed for Shanghai citizens' daily lives and Shanghai industrial products needed by the countryside will also become increasingly difficult, greatly impacting the daily lives of people in both urban and rural areas. This is the third thing that should be noted.</p>
<p>To resolve these three issues, we believe that dispersing Shanghai's industry is a worthwhile consideration. We offer these humble opinions in the hope of attracting the attention of the city's industrial sector and providing a reference for the Chinese and Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Considering the perspective of factories, there are four difficulties in implementing dispersal:</p>
<p>First is the power issue. Currently, most factories in the city rely on electricity as their power source, with very few owning their own generators. Once dispersed, small towns certainly do not have sufficient facilities to supply electricity to factories. Even if they wanted to install their own engines, there would be many difficulties in terms of capital and technology.</p>
<p>Second is the factory building issue. Currently, finding housing in the interior is not easy. Even if suitable factory buildings and sites can be found, issues such as obtaining factory establishment permits from local governments are also very troublesome.</p>
<p>Third is the transportation issue. Factory machinery is large and heavy, not as easy to move as ordinary people's luggage. However, technical difficulties are relatively easy to solve. As far as I know, when a group of newly opened factories in Taicang and Changshu transported machinery from Shanghai, the difficulties encountered during transportation, from obtaining transport permits to the extortion along the way, were beyond the imagination of the average person.</p>
<p>Fourth is the funding issue. Although factories would rather endure temporary relocation losses, the working capital required during the relocation process is also quite substantial. With current financial tightening, not to mention official assistance, borrowing this sum from the financial sector is also quite difficult.</p>
<p>Industrial dispersal is indeed an extremely arduous task, but it is not an unsolvable problem. Currently, production enterprises should not be viewed simply as profit-making organizations but as part of the war machine. All participating countries in this war have listed industrial dispersal as an important national policy. Regardless of how difficult the work or how large the expenditure, factories are willing to endure, and governments provide full assistance. Therefore, if a firm decision can be made regarding the dispersal of Shanghai's industry and political support is obtained at the same time, then even if various difficulties arise due to dispersal, they can be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>Secondly, the electricity supply for factories in this city is severely restricted. Therefore, factories that rely on electricity, which are the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises in Shanghai, may face reduced production or shutdowns at any time (many are already shut down). Rather than lingering on in the present, it is better to look to the future, endure the current inconvenience and losses, and seize this opportunity to lay a permanent foundation for the future. It is hoped that industrial circles will voluntarily form groups of related factories. For example, Industry A and Industry B are often interconnected, and primary processing and reprocessing factories cannot exist separately. When relocating to safer areas, a group of factories can jointly install a power generation device, which not only reduces costs due to shared expenses but also makes it easier to solve technical difficulties due to greater financial resources. In this way, the power issue will not arise.</p>
<p>The city's Dispersal Committee should establish a separate department, such as a Factory Relocation Committee. This committee must include relevant military and government agencies, such as the Economic Bureau, Security Command, Blockade Management Office, Water Police, and the county governments of the dispersal destinations. It must also include the financial industry, mainly the Central Reserve Bank, as well as industrial experts. Then, jointly research and develop a sound implementation plan, designating the factories to be dispersed and the relocation locations. The locations must be dispersed and not concentrated, must be in rural areas and avoid cities, must be convenient for transportation, and must be able to use natural forests for air raid shelters. Then, the group of factories will relocate to the designated location, with the committee supporting the acquisition of relocation and factory establishment permits, the bank providing loans, the military escorting the transport, and industrial experts guiding and solving technical difficulties. In this way, several important issues—transportation, funding, technology, and politics—can be easily resolved.</p>
<p>In the past, the large boilers of the Longzhang Paper Mill and the Liuhegou Iron Factory were able to safely pass through the Three Gorges, thousands of miles away, under extremely difficult circumstances. Then, are Shanghai's small and medium-sized factories unable to disperse to the countryside, which can be reached in a day? After dispersal, from the factory's perspective, some raw materials and fuels can be obtained locally, labor and food costs can be relatively low, and the risk of air raids can be reduced. From the government's perspective, which participating country's government does not assist industry in increasing production? Does not break up industry into smaller units? Government support for industrial dispersal is an undeniable duty. From the Dispersal Committee's perspective, Shanghai is a commercial and industrial city, and industrial and commercial employees and their families account for the largest part of the population. In today's situation where foreign trade has been suspended, commerce almost relies on the city's industry. Once industrial dispersal is realized, at least industrial employees and their families will inevitably relocate along with it, and the purpose of dispersal will naturally be easier to achieve.</p>
<p>The dispersal of industry is of great importance, not only during wartime but also during peacetime. It is hoped that the authorities responsible for dispersal can give it special and careful consideration.</p>

<h3>Divine Wind Corps of Japan Fiercely Attacks, Sinking Seven Enemy Warships; Pillars of Fire Discovered Off Iwo Jima</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): The Special Attack Force of the Divine Wind Corps of the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy mobile units around Iwo Jima on the afternoon of the 21st, sinking or destroying two enemy aircraft carriers and five enemy warships. According to observation reports from the highlands of Iwo Jima, at 5:55 PM on the 21st, a large fire suddenly broke out among the enemy fleet in the waters east of the island, visible from the high ground. At 6:00 PM, it was further confirmed that ten large pillars of fire had erupted in the waters southeast of the island. At 6:50 PM, eleven more large fires were confirmed to have erupted in the waters from the east to the southeast. The above reports have confirmed these to be the results of attacks by the Special Attack Force of the Japanese Divine Wind Corps.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): Since 7:00 AM on the 22nd, enemy landing forces on Iwo Jima, under the cover of naval bombardment and heavy and medium tank units, have advanced towards the southern village area. After fierce counterattacks by the first line of Japanese troops, the two armies are now engaged in fierce fighting. At the same time, Japanese tank units have also launched fierce battles against enemy tank units. Meanwhile, an enemy force on the western side of the island, along with a tank unit, attempted to advance from the Chishima village area towards the Tun Su-tai area in the north. After a brave counterattack by Japanese troops in that area, they were repulsed and pursued to one kilometer southwest of the village. As of 7:00 PM on the 22nd, the enemy on the west coast had been forced to retreat from several locations west of Chishima village. At the same time, due to fierce attacks by Japanese troops in the south to the northern geothermal areas, the enemy was forced to retreat from the first line. As a result, the enemy's attempt to reach the Motoyama airfield through the geothermal area has been fiercely blocked by Japanese troops in the front. Since landing on the 19th, the enemy forces, disregarding losses, have attempted to forcibly advance, but due to continuous counterattacks by Japanese troops, they have not only completely stopped but have also suffered continuous damage to their entire force, resulting in a weakening of combat power and a state of forced retreat.</p>
<p>White Blade Battles Unfold in the Nigane Beach Area</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): Japanese raiding parties on Iwo Jima attacked the enemy's first-line sentry posts from late at night on the 20th to the morning of the 21st, destroying numerous enemy supply warehouses, weapons, and ammunition. Furthermore, a unit of Japanese troops is currently active near the enemy's landing point in the Nigane beach area, engaging in white-blade battles with the enemy and killing many of them.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): On the evening of the 22nd, the enemy forces on Iwo Jima established two pontoon bridges at the southern landing point in the southeastern part of the island, with two transport ships docked. These pontoon bridges were within the firing range of Japanese forces. Due to fierce attacks, they became difficult to use.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 23rd (Central News Agency): Three days have passed since enemy forces landed on Iwo Jima. Through the courageous interception of Japanese forces, they have not advanced an inch. At present, the front lines of the two armies remain unchanged compared to the evening of the 20th. However, the enemy forces are still building bridgeheads in areas such as the south wharf and the south airfield, and reinforcements are continuously landing from the south coast, numbering over ten thousand. As of 6:00 PM on the 21st, the enemy's first line seemed to have formed a front line from the western landing point to the Chishima Fortress, Funami-dai, and Takasago-dai landing points. They concentrated tanks and artillery in the southern area of Funami-dai and continued to transport soldiers and equipment to the front from the south airfield and the vicinity of the landing point, creating a chaotic situation. However, the enemy forces have only appeared north of the airfield, subjecting the Japanese positions in the north to heavy artillery fire. The morale of the Japanese troops is high. The northern positions constructed on the high ground are considered to be a strong and impregnable fortress painstakingly completed by the Japanese. Japanese troops are holding the positions, subjecting the enemy forces to heavy artillery fire or incendiary rounds, causing them heavy casualties. It is reported that the Japanese troops in the Suribachi-yama position are fighting bravely against a superior number of enemies, disregarding the enemy's encirclement.</p>
<p>Nimitz Announces the Battle Situation on Iwo Jima</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): The Nimitz Headquarters announced on the 22nd: "Due to the fierce resistance of the Japanese troops on Iwo Jima, the American troops have made little progress. American troops have now landed another Marine division to increase their strength. The Japanese troops are fiercely resisting with artillery and white-blade attacks." Furthermore, a United Press report on the 22nd stated: "The landing enemy forces, gradually advancing north towards the central airfield, have been completely blocked in front of the airfield. The resistance of the Japanese troops in the southern region is also gradually increasing. American troops are currently holding the Suribachi-yama position, engaging in fierce battles with Japanese troops using tanks and flamethrowers. On the afternoon of the 21st, due to fierce counterattacks by Japanese troops on the east side of Suribachi-yama, American troops lost four tanks. Moreover, the American and Japanese troops have now engaged in close combat, and the American troops can no longer obtain air cover, relying only on tanks, flamethrowers, machine guns, and other firearms to continue fighting the Japanese troops. American medical units, coastal cargo handling units, and soldiers in landing craft are all subjected to shelling by Japanese troops. This time, another Marine division has re-landed, so the total force has reached four divisions, and they are still continuing to fight hard." Furthermore, war correspondent Landzback described the fierce battle as follows: "There is no fixed front line on the fiercely contested Iwo Jima. The entire small island is covered in gray dust, and at night it is surrounded by cold air. Since the American naval forces arrived near the southern airfield on the 19th, that area and the Suribachi-yama area have become the front line. In fact, the entire coastal area within range of artillery fire has become a front line. Because the entire island is only five miles long, and because the Japanese artillery fire is very fierce, there is no so-called safe zone. Japanese troops are currently using all the caves and other cover on the island to fiercely resist. In recent days, American troops have used thousands of tons of bombs to bombard Japanese positions from the sea and air, but the Japanese resistance has not diminished. On the third day of the landing operation, the enemy forces have felt that this island is the only difficult battlefield in the Pacific. As for how much time it will take to completely destroy the island, no one can say for sure."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from Washington, a United Press dispatch from the Pacific Fleet Headquarters stated: "From the night of February 21st to the 22nd, the four front lines of the American Marine Corps on Iwo Jima repeatedly blocked fierce counterattacks. On February 22nd, they began an attack towards the central airfield. The American Marine Corps were subjected to fierce shelling by Japanese troops. As of the afternoon of the 22nd, American troops advanced slowly in the rain, destroying several Japanese artillery positions, weakening their airfield, but there was little change on the front lines. The American troops on Suribachi-yama corresponded with the northern front line and began another offensive. By noon, American troops launched an attack on the front of Suribachi-yama under the most difficult circumstances. The American fleet subjected the Japanese positions in the northern region of Iwo Jima to heavy artillery fire. Although under rainy and poor weather conditions, the naval air force still provided heavy artillery, machine gun strafing, and artillery support to the ground forces. On the 21st, Japanese bombers and fighter squadrons attacked several American surface ships around Iwo Jima, causing many difficulties for the ships. As of 5:45 PM on the 21st, the total casualties of the ground troops amounted to 4,553. The landing of logistics supplies is very difficult due to the volcanic coastline. It is still continuing."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency): According to reports from the front lines, fierce battles are continuing day and night on Iwo Jima, centered on the Suribachi-yama area and the northern area of the south airfield. A communiqué issued by the Nimitz Headquarters on the 21st stated: "The Fifth Amphibious Task Force, having gained a foothold near the south airfield, attacked the central airfield on the 21st. Another unit is currently engaged in battle with Japanese troops in the south of the island. The naval forces assisting the two battlefields are engaged in a major battle for every inch of ground due to the intense firing of Japanese artillery and rocket launchers. Furthermore, Japanese troops are currently counterattacking all the strongholds within the area invaded by American troops. On the night of the 20th, Japanese troops attacked the American left wing under the cover of artillery fire and tanks. The American troops were forced to use naval guns to fire shells and flares to cover their ground forces in combat. From this, it can be seen that the American troops are currently in a state of hard fighting."</p>
<h3>Manila Street Battles Continue Fiercely; No Change in Northern Luzon Plains</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 23rd (Central News Agency): The street battles in Manila are currently extremely fierce. Japanese garrison troops are holding the ruins of the old city of Intramuros and its nearby central government offices, city hall, and buildings near the University of the Philippines, launching strong and fierce counterattacks. The vicinity of Nichols Airfield, the Paseo area in the south of Manila, the vicinity of Paco, and the coastal areas have become battlefields everywhere. Because the enemy forces have repeatedly failed to capture the city, after declaring the destructive attack, they began a terrible shelling and bombing from the 21st onwards. Later, towards evening, they invaded a corner of the city with three tanks and 500 infantry, but due to the naval forces of Japan coordinating fierce counterattacks, they were eventually repulsed. In the vicinity of Nichols Airfield and the Paseo area in the south of Manila, the naval forces of Japan launched courageous ramming tactics against the enemy, and the fierce fighting is extremely intense. In the battle near Paco, six enemy tanks have been destroyed, over 400 enemy soldiers have been killed or wounded, and many flamethrowers and other weapons have been captured. The land and naval forces of Japan on Corregidor Island are still securing the positions on the surrounding hills and dense forests, launching fierce battles against the enemy, causing great damage to the enemy. Also, the artillery on the island still in the hands of the Japanese is shelling dozens of enemy warships that are patrolling around the island and occasionally shelling it with naval guns. At the same time, they are preventing enemy warships from invading Manila Bay from the North and South Channels.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): Japanese troops who departed from the highlands northeast of Manila attacked the enemy at Angat on the 17th, repulsing 600 enemies and continuing to attack, inflicting great damage on them. Furthermore, Japanese troops who broke into Meycauayan encircled approximately 150 enemies carrying five armored vehicles near Bulacan, five kilometers northeast of the city, and annihilated them at 3:00 PM on the 17th, capturing four armored vehicles and destroying another. The Japanese troops in that area gradually returned to their original state from the night of the 20th. The Japanese troops who were stubbornly holding on to Intramuros (within the old city) continued their tough defense and repeatedly launched attacks on the enemy. At the same time, the Japanese troops at the Mckinley Barracks in the southeast also launched a bloody and courageous battle against the enemy. The enemy forces were still attempting to reinforce their forces at Camp Crame. In addition to reinforcing their forces in the Marikina area north of Manila, they also reinforced Manila from the Aklan area south of Manila.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): There has been no major change in the battle situation in the northern plains of Central Luzon in recent days. However, enemy forces attempting to break through the Japanese defensive lines in the area between San Jose and Salasa and attempt to encircle the rear of the Japanese positions at San Jose were counterattacked by Japanese troops when they moved out, inflicting a severe blow and forcing them to retreat to the west. There has been almost no change on the Santo Tomas front. On the Pozorrubio front, Japanese troops launched a counterattack on the 16th against a strong enemy force, inflicting considerable damage on them. Japanese troops on the Tarlac and San Jose fronts launched brave attacks against the enemy at any time, destroying a pair of heavy howitzers on the night of the 16th and destroying several of their supply warehouses. The enemy in that area attempted to encircle the rear of the Japanese positions at San Isidro, disrupting the Japanese rear, but were heavily attacked by the Japanese side and began to retreat on the 17th.</p>

<h3>Millions of Troops on the Eastern Front Launch Decisive Battle; Soviet Forces on the Southern Flank Reach the Banks of the Nizh River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency: The great battle raging around Guben and west of Breslau in Silesia, and in West Prussia and Pomerania, is intensifying, and the clash of millions of troops is entering a new phase. The situation is particularly tense with Soviet forces reinforcing and advancing on the directions of Crossen, Frankfurt, and Küstrin. The current lull in the key battle locations seems to be the calm before a storm.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (German News Agency): Within the past two days, two focal points have emerged in the Silesia region. The first is west of Breslau, where Soviet forces are constantly transferring infantry and artillery formations, pressing the German covering artillery force in front of the Riesengebirge (Giant Mountains), while also attacking the Breslau fortress from the south. The second major battle focus is in the Lauban-Görlitz area, where Soviet forces have expanded their large-scale combat to the Nizh River. Soviet forces reached the river on Wednesday along a wide front, as far as Guben.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in East Prussia; German Forces Withdraw from Zinten</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (German News Agency): On Wednesday, the battle in East Prussia unfolded into a large-scale affair, with approximately 2,000 Soviet aircraft constantly assisting ground operations. Although Soviet ammunition and tanks are of extremely superior quality, there were no noteworthy victories to be mentioned on that day. The main Soviet formations are currently concentrated near Braunsberg and the Zinten area. Other powerful Soviet forces are fiercely attacking the German line in Samland, their objective clearly being to sever the connection between Königsberg and the sea. After several hours of fierce fighting in the city of Zinten, German forces had to withdraw to the west. At that time, the area was completely leveled. Near Braunsberg, Soviet forces attacked east and northeast all day long on both sides of the highway, where a large tank battle unfolded.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency: Last night, Moscow admitted for the second time that Soviet forces had again withdrawn from the Samland peninsula. Soviet reports stated that, after a counterattack by a large German force, Soviet forces were forced to retreat from the northern coast of the bay.</p>
<h3>Denmark Under German Military Control Declares Martial Law</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency): Regarding the resolutions of the Crimean Conference, the Allied forces are reportedly launching attacks on Germany from all four directions (east, south, west, and north). Recent discussions have focused on the Allied forces’ northward push into Germany. According to a report from Copenhagen, the German military authorities stationed in Denmark have been broadcasting daily throughout Denmark since the 22nd, declaring a state of emergency from 8 PM to 4 AM the following morning.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Casualties Since the Start of the War Reach Fifteen Million</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): According to a report from New York, Shen Hanli, a well-known anti-Soviet commentator, stated in a notification in New York on the 21st that the Soviet Union has lost 15 million personnel in this war.</p>
<h3>International Cotton Advisory Committee Meeting to Be Held Next Month in Washington, D.C.</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency reports that the U.S. State Department announced that the International Cotton Advisory Committee will hold its fourth meeting in Washington, D.C. on March 26th. The committee was established in September 1939 to examine global cotton industry issues. This meeting will study the cotton industry situations in various countries and international trade issues, and will provide recommendations for reference by all countries.</p>
<h3>Effective Action to Be Taken on International Monetary Cooperation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency reports from Washington, D.C.: The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that effective action will be taken based on the recommendations of the Bretton Woods Conference regarding international monetary cooperation.</p>
<h3>Allied Aircraft Attack Germany, Shoot Down Over a Hundred; No Change in the Western Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): On the 21st, Allied aircraft attacked Berlin and the Rhine-Westphalia region in the west, and bombed Winnöenburg. The German air defense forces shot down 117 of them that day and night, mostly four-engine heavy bombers. The German Air Force's night fighters were particularly active in this operation.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency reports: Eisenhower's major offensive into northern Germany has not yet materialized. The First Canadian Army is on the northern flank, the U.S. Third Army is on the southern flank, and two-thirds of the British Second Army and the U.S. First and Ninth Armies are in the central part of the Western Front, but have not yet exerted their combat power. One air transport division has also not participated in the battle. The major battle between the German army and the British and American forces has not yet begun. The British and Canadian armies are applying pressure between the Rhine and Meuse rivers, but have not succeeded. The U.S. Third Army is making even slower progress and suffering heavier losses. The launch of a major offensive on the Ruhr River front is also far from certain. However, it is also possible that Eisenhower will seek other developments.</p>
<h3>Germany Reduces Food Rations</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency): The German government announced that in order to ensure food rations for April, temporary measures are being taken to temporarily reduce the ration amount by 12.5%.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Attacking Germany Cause Concern for Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>After the Soviet Red Army launched a large-scale artillery bombardment on January 12th, they immediately launched an unprecedented winter offensive from the Sandomierz area. This was expected by Germany, which has always known the strength of the Soviet Union and that it would be able to launch a surprising offensive, so Germany calmly responded. The United Nations' plan to invade German territory on the Western Front suffered a disastrous defeat, so the Soviet Red Army launched a massive offensive from the east to seek a surrender under the city walls. The numerical superiority of the United Nations forces over the German forces has been fully demonstrated on all battlefields, especially on the Eastern Front. Before this Soviet winter offensive was launched, according to the estimates of neutral military experts, the Soviet forces were as follows:</p>
<p>Soviet Military Strength</p>
<p>East Prussian border area: 20 to 30 infantry divisions, 10 armored divisions, 10 to 20 artillery regiments.</p>
<p>East Prussia to Warsaw area: 20 infantry divisions, 20 armored divisions, 10 artillery regiments.</p>
<p>Warsaw to southern Poland area: 40 infantry divisions, 30 armored divisions, 25 artillery regiments.</p>
<p>Krakow and Upper Silesia: 25 to 30 infantry divisions, 20 armored divisions, 20 artillery regiments.</p>
<p>In addition, the Petrov army (Fourth Ukrainian Front) operating in Czechoslovakia has 15 infantry divisions, 5 armored divisions, and 2 artillery regiments. On the Hungarian front, there are another 20 to 30 infantry divisions, 10 to 20 armored divisions, and 5 artillery regiments, as well as the Romanian army that surrendered to the Soviet Union, about 10 infantry divisions. Against such a powerful Soviet army, the German army has only one-fifth of its strength, or at most no more than one-half. However, Germany has reserve troops in the rear. It is generally estimated that there are two armored divisions stationed in Frankfurt on the Oder River, two to three elite guard divisions, and a similar number of Volksgrenadier divisions.</p>
<p>Political Infighting</p>
<p>This Soviet military breakthrough of the German front is the largest of the Soviet military offensives. But what is most noteworthy is that this Soviet winter offensive happened to coincide with the time when Britain and the United States were launching political offensives against Germany and the Soviet Union. In addition, the United Nations failed to break through the German defense line on the Western Front, but the Soviet Red Army won a major victory on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can also be said that the Soviet Union thwarted the political offensives of Britain and the United States. Due to its military achievements, the Soviet Union has already gained a vast sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and Southeastern Europe. However, the United States believes that the Soviet Union's rapid development was entirely instigated by Britain. Now Britain is unable to resolve the internal disputes in Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Greece, and other countries. Britain and the United States are astonished at seeing their powerful ally exerting unimaginable power, and have no choice but to give in to the Soviet Union. Therefore, in order to limit this behavior of the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States had to urgently seek to convene a summit of the three major powers. However, the recent Soviet military developments on the Eastern Front have completely shattered the optimistic psychology that Britain and the United States had been so confident in the past.</p>
<p>In other words, initially, due to the Red Army's rapid military success, Britain and the United States were overjoyed, thinking that the war was about to end, but now their joy has turned to worry.</p>
<p>Soviet Strategy</p>
<p>What is Stalin's intention in adopting this blitzkrieg tactic? Is Stalin perhaps dealing with Germany in the same way as he is dealing with other European countries, trying to expand the Soviet Union's influence?</p>
<p>This is what Britain and the United States are worried about. At the same time, within Britain and the United States, there are many people who are criticizing and condemning the failure of the Western Front to progress according to plan. The public opinion circles in Britain and the United States must break through the German defense line as soon as possible. The realist Stalin, seeing that Britain and the United States are at a loss with the domestic political problems of the "liberated countries," believes that this is the best opportunity to launch an offensive. The summit of the three countries has already been held. If Britain does not resolve many problems as soon as possible in the face of its powerful allies, it will not be able to show its true colors.

<p>Student Aid News for Readers</p>
<h3>Joint Charity Performance by University Students; "Fleeting Wealth" to Be Performed for Charity Today and Tomorrow; Tickets Sold in Addition to Pre-Sold Honorary Tickets</h3>
<p>Students from fourteen universities in the city, including St. John's, Shanghai, Aurora, Aurora Women's College, Fudan, Comparative Law School of China, Jiaotong, East China, Datong, Daxia, Wend, Nantong, Franco-Chinese Institute, and German Medical School, have been preparing for two months for a joint charity performance of the stage play "Fleeting Wealth" to raise funds for the readers' student aid fund of this newspaper. The dress rehearsal yesterday morning at 10 AM was very successful. It has been decided that performances will be held at the Guanxin Grand Theater at 10 AM and 7 PM this morning and tomorrow. At that time, we respectfully request the support of people from all walks of life to attend and provide guidance to express our gratitude.</p>
<p>This joint charity performance of "Fleeting Wealth" initiated by students from various universities to raise student aid funds is entirely voluntary. All work related to rehearsals and donations is also entirely undertaken by the students. The student aid fund office only provides guidance and supervision. This semester, tuition fees at various schools have skyrocketed along with prices, while industry and commerce are very depressed. As a result, donations to this year's student aid fund were not very enthusiastic at first. This situation aroused the spirit of self-help and mutual assistance among the students of various schools. In addition to this charity performance, 96 special fundraising teams are entirely composed of students from various schools. Recently, the charity bazaar jointly organized by the two new newspapers and the Young Men's and Women's Christian Associations also achieved unexpectedly satisfactory results due to the enthusiastic efforts of the students from various schools. The academic achievements of the student aid students were publicly exhibited before the rainy season for inspection by all sectors of society. This year's charity performance, charity bazaar, and fundraising work can also be said to be an opportunity for all sectors of society to inspect their extracurricular work spirit. This kind of activity also adds valuable experience to themselves. Because of the short time, this charity performance was not fully prepared, but we deeply believe that each role can do their best according to the plot of the play, predicting that the students of various schools will be able to make contributions to the country and society in the future. Participation in the charity performance, charity bazaar, and fundraising work is not limited to student aid students. The enthusiasm and efforts of other students are even more admirable.</p>
<p>Please Pay Attention to Ticket Exchange Time</p>
<p>All those holding honorary tickets and regular tickets, originally scheduled for 2 PM on the 17th, can exchange them at 10 AM on the 24th; and tickets for 7 PM on the 17th, can exchange them at 7 PM on the 24th. Also, tickets for 2 PM on the 18th, can exchange them at 10 AM on the 25th; and tickets for 7 PM on the 18th, can exchange them at 7 PM on the 25th. Now, to reduce trouble, there is no need to make a reservation, and you can exchange them as soon as you arrive. This is very important.</p>
<p>Shanghai University Wins Two Banners</p>
<p>This joint charity performance of "Fleeting Wealth" by fourteen universities has received enthusiastic support and generous donations from all sectors of society, achieving satisfactory results. Students from various schools have been working day and night to promote ticket sales, and their spirit is commendable. It is reported that Shanghai University has achieved the best ticket sales among the fourteen universities, with a total of 1.2 million yuan, winning the group banner. Pei Huizhen, a student from the Department of Political Science of the university, achieved the best individual ticket sales, with a total of 300,000 yuan, winning the championship. Zhang Xiaofang, a student from the Department of Sociology, won the second place with a total of 230,000 yuan. This has become a popular story.</p>

Now, thanks to the understanding of the two gentlemen, they have returned the 200,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes that I compensated to Mr. Shi, and refused to accept it. I feel ashamed and guilty in my heart. Now, in the name of Mr. Jing and Mr. Shi, I will donate the funds to your newspaper's student aid fund and the Xinwenbao's loan scholarship fund, each 100,000 yuan, to benefit the two gentlemen and thank them for their spirit of chivalry."</p>

<h3>Police and Military Authorities Determined to Cooperate, Enforce New Price Ceilings, and Issue Specific Measures Hoping Merchants Will Comply</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood in this city, the economic authorities have adopted emergency measures, and the Price Review Committee has assessed and set price ceilings for eleven major commodities, which have been announced and implemented. The Municipal Police Department is determined to cooperate in maintaining these newly established price ceilings. With the assistance of the military and police authorities, the Fourth Division of the Economic Police Team will take firm and decisive measures. All outstanding economic police officers have been mobilized to form investigation teams of three officers each, cooperating with military police to conduct thorough investigations in shops and markets throughout the city. Those who violate the regulations will be severely punished upon verification. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to the person in charge of the team yesterday. According to him, the team is fully determined to maintain the new price ceilings in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. As for the specific measures, it is hoped that merchants will cherish themselves, strictly abide by them, and avoid breaking the law.</p>
<p>Enforce Formal Labeling</p>
<p>(1) For all goods, all shops must mark the price on the item, using labels, so that citizens can see it at a glance when shopping, and merchants must not take advantage of this to raise prices at will. Violators will be punished. (2) Issue invoices, regardless of the format. For the sale of any item, shops and companies must issue invoices to ensure fairness. However, the format of the invoice is not restricted, but if there are false invoices, it will be considered a violation and severely punished. (3) Enforce government orders. Regardless of the reason, the Economic Police will enforce the new price ceilings. That is, all goods must be sold in accordance with the new price ceilings. Even if merchants have any reason to raise prices, the team will ignore them and severely punish them in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Strictly Punish Refusal to Sell</p>
<p>Any shops or businesses that have goods and refuse to sell them in accordance with the new price ceilings will also be severely punished. As for wholesale businesses, although the authorities do not limit wholesale prices, the principle is that the maximum profit should not exceed 20%. For example, if the price ceiling is 1,000 yuan, the wholesale price should only be 800 yuan. Violators will also be punished. For the above measures, the chairmen of the various trade associations should closely assist the authorities and urge their colleagues to implement them faithfully. If any colleague or shop violates the law, the chairman of the relevant trade association will also be held jointly liable. It is hoped that citizens will cooperate in reporting illegal merchants for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Committee Schedules Meeting, Distributes Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>The Municipal Winter Relief Committee, in order to distribute winter clothing, convened twenty-seven organizations including public welfare, charitable, and moral groups at 3:00 PM on the 23rd to hold the first representative conference for distributing clothing. Those present included Hu Shouqi from the Social Welfare Bureau, Qiu Lihua from the Child Protection Section of the Health Bureau, Chen Zhiqing, the town head of Xujiahui, An Ziying, the district chief of the Salvation Army, and more than thirty others. Chairman Huang Jingwan delivered the opening speech, followed by speeches by Hu Shouqi, Ding Bingnan, Zhang Zhiyu, An Ziying, Zhang Yichen, Dong Zizu, and others, who expressed many opinions on the methods and precautions for distributing winter clothing. The following was then decided: (1) Apply for winter clothing procedures starting immediately, (2) Distribute winter clothing in various districts starting on March 1, (3) The winter clothing work will end on March 10. It is reported that the Winter Relief Committee's work on distributing clothing in the 33rd year (of the Republic) was originally planned to be completed earlier, but due to procedures such as donations, the allocation of cotton cloth, and sewing and distribution, it had to be delayed until now. However, the authorities' concern for the poor is especially worthy of praise. It is heard that the committee's goal of making 12,600 sets of winter clothing has now been achieved. In addition to the total of 10,400 sets to be distributed to the various groups, the remaining surplus will be reserved for special purposes in the future.</p>
<h3>Director Zhou Distributes Six Million Yuan in New Year Bonuses to Subordinates</h3>
<p>Police Chief Zhou, who is also the director of the city's police force, has issued six million yuan in bonuses to his subordinates from the deputy director down to the section chiefs, to encourage them during the Spring Festival. The distribution method is: 53,000 yuan per person for the deputy director level, 30,000 yuan per person for the section chief level, 15,000 yuan per person for the deputy section chief level, and 8,000 yuan per person for the section director level. Other personnel of the same level will be issued according to the previous standards according to their respective ranks. The payments were issued by the accounting section of the First Division of the bureau, starting at 11:00 AM on the 21st. As for the police officers below the section director level, 35 million yuan in donations from the Citizens' Welfare Association will be distributed by grade.</p>
<p>In September of last year, Wang Chonghua sent a letter seeking employment and was assigned as a traveling reporter. He was suspended after a half-month trial period. It is recently learned that the person still uses this paper's business card outside. In addition to investigating this, we hope that all sectors of society will pay attention and not be fooled.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Mengqu Passed Away in Beijing</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Mengqu, named Ertian, was from Hang County, Zhejiang. He was well-versed in classics and history, and also studied Buddhism and medicine. He was the author of books such as "History of Weihou Feizhuan" and "Baihoutong Kao," which were famous at home and abroad, and especially admired by Japanese and German people. When the Qing History Museum was established, Zhao Erxun admired him and invited him to be a co-editor. To compile national history in plain clothes was indeed an unusual event. Later, he taught at Peking University, National Chengchi University, Jiaotong University, and other schools. His students were all over the world. Recently, news came from Beijing that Mr. Zhang passed away in Beijing on the morning of February 19 (the seventh day of the first lunar month). His old friends at sea all mourned him. It is heard that Mr. Zhang was poor and his funeral was simple. Since there was no way to prepare for the funeral, relatives and friends planned to raise funds to help with the funeral.</p>
<h3>Reconstruction Bank and Bank, Re-Elect Official and Business Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Special City Reconstruction Bank increased its capital, the originally appointed official and business directors and supervisors should be re-appointed and re-elected according to the rules. Regarding the election of business directors and supervisors, the shareholder meeting was opened in October last year. Sun Yaodong, Chen Shaowei, Wang Yizhi, Shen Jixuan, and Li Liwen were elected as directors, and Ji Yilong was elected as a supervisor. All official directors and supervisors were also appointed by the municipal government: Zhou Fohai, Luo Junqiang, Zhao Shuyong, Xu Jiang, Shen Guanzhun, and Ling Xianwen as directors, and Liu Xingquan and Xu Songping as supervisors. On the afternoon of February 20, the bank held the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors after the capital increase in the municipal government conference room. Zhou, the mayor, and Luo, the secretary-general, were unanimously elected as managing directors. Sun Yaodong, another business managing director, was re-elected. Zhou, the managing director, was also appointed as the chairman of the board by the municipal government to preside over the bank's affairs.</p>

<h3>Basketball Finals Last Night Ended Without Result</h3>
<p>In the Public Basketball League, the two winning teams from Group A and Group B, Donghua and Zhongbei, met in the finals last night. Unexpectedly, when the game reached the last eight minutes, the Donghua team questioned referee Wang Jien's decision, believing it to be wrong. The referee ruled that Donghua had forfeited the game, while Donghua declared that it reserved the right to protest. The game ended unhappily. Last night, Donghua was in the lead all the way, with the score being 30 to 24. In the other two women's matches, Sansheng won against Overseas Chinese with a score of 27 to 15, and the Green Team won against Lianyi with a score of 54 to 12.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Song Zhengyin's Oil Paintings</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Currently, people seem to have forgotten art, forgetting this highest form of human cultural activity. We see: the Shanghai art scene is so desolate, perhaps there are one or two art exhibitions that gather sporadically. But, when asked what its essence is? It turns out to be just a gathering for excitement.</p>
<p>Although the oil painting exhibition of the young painter Song Zhenggu is not particularly eye-catching, at least he is not like the usual gathering for excitement. He is presenting the true results of studying art, explaining how he studies? And explaining what he is studying?</p>
<p>Mr. Song's entire output is about forty or fifty works, including figures, landscapes, and still lifes. His style tends to be very new. But, this new trend may be the reason for the young painter's self-indulgence. However, there will be no such danger in Mr. Song's art, because Mr. Song is developing in many ways in terms of expressive techniques. This is a general characteristic of modern art.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, my old friend Liu Shi Jun, graduated from the Department of Art of Japan University. After returning to Shanghai, he held a solo exhibition. The Chinese people regarded his works as having the general characteristics of modern art. In the past ten years, I have not heard of anyone succeeding him. Now Mr. Song also graduated from the school, and his artistic style is exactly the same. If it is said that he and Mr. Liu complement each other on the domestic art scene, who would say it is not appropriate?</p>

<h3>University Alumni Advancement Association, Amusement Fair Postponed</h3>
<p>Rescheduled for March 14</p>
<p>The University Alumni Advancement Association, together with university alumni, launched a grand amusement fair to respond to this newspaper's education assistance and poverty relief campaign. The planned entertainment programs include the drama "Happy Reunion" and the Peking opera "Chun Qiu Pei." In order to strengthen the lineup, celebrities and singers were invited, as well as the Happiness Orchestra's Hawaiian music. Although the alumni have been enthusiastically working hard, due to the scale of the event, it was not possible to prepare in time, so it could not be performed as scheduled. It has now been decided to postpone the performance to 2:00 PM on March 14 at the original Jin Cheng site. All the tickets issued before will be valid at that time. It is hoped that all sponsors will understand. It is also reported that the association has scheduled a meeting for cadres at its association on Jiujiang Road at 4:00 PM on the 25th of this month. All members are requested to attend on time.</p>
<h3>Please Uphold the Righteousness of Respecting the Worthy and Providing Generous Support to Scholars</h3>
<p>Since the war started in our country, scholars from all over the country have taken refuge in the corners of Shanghai. Many of them are living in difficult circumstances, bordering on utter exhaustion. These people have devoted their entire lives to academic pursuits, and they are truly the backbone of the country and the essence of the nation. They stand tall like the spiritual light of the Lu Temple, admired by scholars. But now they are ashamed of empty bottles and hungry stomachs! I hope that the many wealthy people in Shanghai will admire Wei Gongzi's lofty style of being friendly to Zisi, and treat these scholars with the righteousness of respecting the worthy, providing generous support, and giving regular salaries and food, so as to alleviate their worries about life and enable them to concentrate on researching and writing. If this is the case, then it will not only be the private fortune of the recipients, but also benefit the promotion of scholarship, the cultivation of customs, and the future of the country and nation!

<h3>Expanded Tuberculosis Prevention, X-Ray Examination Time</h3>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium in this city, in view of recent statistical reports that tuberculosis is extremely rampant, and also due to the daytime power restrictions, has expanded the fire-visiting tuberculosis X-ray examination time, changing it to every night from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM. This will greatly help to popularize early diagnosis and promote tuberculosis prevention work. It is hoped that the general public will plan ahead and carry out the examination as soon as possible, and not miss this opportunity. The location is 990 Taishan Road.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Send Injury Treatment Vouchers</h3>
<p>Lin Zhentang has always been enthusiastic about charitable undertakings. It has made a great wish to print free injury treatment vouchers, distribute them to the poor and sick, and invite Mr. Tong Zhongyi, a martial arts expert, to be responsible for medical services. I have received one hundred copies twice before, and they have been sent out. Now I have received another fifty copies, which I will distribute on your behalf. Patients can pick them up from this office and be introduced to the clinic. After diagnosis, all injury medicines and ointments required will be provided free of charge. However, because the medicine is expensive, costing at least hundreds for minor cases and thousands for serious cases, it must be limited to the truly poor and sick. The location is 23, Lane 124, Southern Section, Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road. Time: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Serious illnesses are treated immediately.</p>
<h3>Canadian Condensed Milk Charity Sale to Help the Children's Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese Children's Relief Association held a fundraising campaign last year, and the results were satisfactory. However, due to the sharp rise in prices and high expenses, it is still difficult to continue to provide for the more than 300 orphans currently being cared for. Now, Qu Chaojun, feeling sorry for the young children, has specially donated two bags of corn flour, totaling 400 catties, for the association's orphans' food. He will also sell 48 cans of Canadian condensed milk saved by his son and others through a charity sale. The minimum bid price is 72,000 yuan (calculated at 1,500 yuan per can), and all proceeds from the sale will be used to help the Children's Relief Association's expenses in order to maximize the effect of relief. According to Qi Chaojun's opinion, the condensed milk is produced by Haining Foreign Company, 13 and a half taels per can, and the current market price is 1,680 yuan per can. Buyers not only do not suffer losses, but also benefit from a very meaningful good deed. It's a win-win situation. It is expected that enthusiastic people will be happy to make this happen, and it will not disappoint Qi Chaojun's efforts. (Buyers can contact the association, phone number 82273).</p>

<h3>The Problem of Population Dispersion</h3>
<p>— Jin Xiong Bai</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of dispersing the population of Shanghai, whether it is to reduce the harm of air raids or to maintain the supply of food and public order in Shanghai, it is a matter of urgent importance. The municipal government has already decided to organize a dispersion committee to handle this matter full-time, and the municipal advisory committee will also assist it with all its strength, so that the key points can be grasped and the details worked out. In the near term, it will definitely be able to proceed smoothly step by step.</p>
<p>The dispersion method decided this time is based on the principle of being voluntary. Of course, charitable institutions such as nursing homes, orphanages, and disability homes, which have no need to stay in Shanghai, should be forcibly dispersed. So, what is the total number of residents who will be voluntarily dispersed in the first step? We can only guess now that there are indeed many who are willing to leave Shanghai, but the exact number is still impossible to count. Handling dispersion is not only a difficult task, but also requires too much funding. If the number of people in the first step cannot be determined, once it is implemented, many difficulties will be felt. Therefore, I advocate that the number of registered people and the location of their return to their hometown should be determined immediately. Only after this can the funding and preparation of transportation be thoroughly resolved. As for the organization handling the registration, I think that the various hometown associations and citizen welfare associations are duty-bound.</p>
<p>Second, before dispersing the population, everyone is paying attention to the transportation problem. The difficulty of transportation, poor management, and the extortion of hooligans and irresponsible staff will all affect the progress of the work, which is indeed a serious problem. But I don't think this is the most threatening problem, because with the strength of the city government and all the citizens, it is still enough to overcome this difficulty under the current environment. If the dispersion of the population is only to help them get train tickets and ship tickets, and how to escort them onto the train and ship, then our dispersion work has already determined the root cause of failure. A certain kind of resident wants to leave Shanghai because they feel that there may be some kind of danger in the future. They have the financial resources themselves, and they also have their own methods of transportation, which are of course not within the scope of our work. The target of our work is, first, part of them still have property or work in their hometowns to maintain their livelihoods, or they are working in Shanghai and plan to send their families back home. What they need help with is only the transportation problem. The second type is those who cannot live in Shanghai and have nowhere to return. The dispersion of the former is relatively easy, as long as the transportation problem is solved. The latter type of residents is more troublesome. The fundraising for travel expenses, the selection of dispersion locations, the maintenance of life after arrival, and the attention to management not only require a lot of money and a long time, but especially reliable, capable and responsible staff.</p>
<p>The timing is getting more and more urgent, and we should decide and implement it immediately. If we wait until we have to disperse before starting to handle it, it may be too late.</p>
<p>Special Issue on Population Dispersion</p>
<h3>Humble Opinions on Dispersing the Population</h3>
<p>— Chen Riping</p>
<p>Since Shanghai opened as a port, it has become the economic and financial center of our country due to its geographical relationship. Moreover, due to frequent internal conflicts in the past, more and more residents of the interior have moved here, regarding it as a place to live and work in peace. The population has increased to as many as five million people.</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred earlier, and the European and Greater East Asia wars followed, overseas transportation has been completely blocked. At this time of increasingly fierce war, the exchanges between various places have become more and more obstructed. This city was originally an industrial and commercial area, and the supply of food depends on all parties. In the event that transportation is cut off and food transportation is insufficient, it is inevitable that various serious situations will arise. Therefore, the issue of dispersing the population of this city is the most urgent issue that needs to be resolved today. In view of this, the municipal government has set up a Population Dispersion Committee to actively promote this matter. However, dispersion work is not easy. Without a detailed plan and careful preparation, it is not enough to achieve complete success. I have a few points that must be considered first, listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Receiving Areas:</p>
<p>A. Ensuring Public Security;</p>
<p>B. Ensuring Food Supply;</p>
<p>C. Facilitating Production Activities.</p>
<p>The public security of the receiving area must first be paid attention to, otherwise repeated relocation will exhaust the people's patience, and the officials will also be overwhelmed. At the same time, whether the food in the area is easy to collect and transport is a concern. I am afraid that the problem in this place will be solved, and the problem in the other place will arise one after another, which is not a perfect solution. Secondly, it is also a hidden worry that the dispersed people are idle all day long. If they can be integrated into production activities, it will benefit both the public and private sectors. Therefore, whether the production activities in the area are convenient should also be paid attention to.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Transportation:</p>
<p>A. Railways;</p>
<p>B. Waterways;</p>
<p>C. Other Vehicles.</p>
<p>Transportation is essential for dispersion. How to prepare it should be carefully planned and well coordinated, otherwise the effort will be doubled and the result will be halved, and it will be difficult to achieve results quickly.</p>
<p>(3) Dispersion Procedures:</p>
<p>A. Those who have the financial resources and the means should disperse on their own;</p>
<p>B. Those who are supported by charitable relief organizations should ask the organizations to request the Dispersion Committee to find a way;</p>
<p>C. Those who have the financial resources but no means should ask the Dispersion Committee to find a way;</p>
<p>D. Those who have no financial resources and want to disperse should ask their hometown associations or other public welfare and charitable organizations to find a way;</p>
<p>E. The general elderly, weak, women and children should be persuaded to disperse by the various hometown associations or Baojia offices;</p>
<p>F. Those who have no occupation and no fixed residence should be dispersed by the government.</p>
<p>(4) Detailed Measures:</p>
<p>Detailed measures should be discussed and decided by the various hometown associations, public welfare and charitable organizations, Baojia offices, and the Population Dispersion Committee.</p>
<p>The above are just a few suggestions based on my limited knowledge, offered for the consideration of the municipal authorities, and for the discussion of those who care about the issue of dispersing the population of this city.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites for Evacuation</h3>
<p>— Zhu Gongming</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, the newspaper reported on Secretary-General Luo's conversation regarding the evacuation of the city's population, stating that the government has decided to establish a population evacuation committee to actively carry out the task. This demonstrates a profound and far-reaching plan. Observing the current situation, the matter has become extremely urgent. If the evacuation is left to the citizens themselves, it will inevitably lead to delays and errors, making it difficult to achieve the government's planned evacuation of one million people. This is because the psychology of the citizens tends to be complacent, and they often do not feel anxious until a crisis is imminent. Expecting them to evacuate on their own will inevitably lead to delays and mistakes, resulting in very little success. The government should step forward to actively supervise and guide, so that the elderly, weak, women, children, and unnecessary personnel can be evacuated to various places as soon as possible, to avoid unexpected events and unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of providing convenience for those being evacuated: Currently, the two major obstacles for travelers are the train stations and wharves, which are truly frightening. The chaotic situation at the North Sixth District of Shanghai has gradually improved after rectification; however, the situation at the steamship wharves is equally chaotic, even worse than at the train stations. Not only is it difficult to buy ship tickets outside of the black market, but every piece of luggage arriving at the port must go through three or four layers of extortion. Even when it is moved into the ship, no matter the suitcase or basket, each piece costs several thousand yuan, sometimes even more than ten thousand yuan. The extent of such black market practices for getting luggage on board can be imagined. Illegal behaviors by the "red and white hats" (porters) at these steamship wharves should naturally be improved.</p>
<p>The restrictions on luggage taken by evacuating citizens should be relaxed. Generally, when citizens return to their hometowns, they do not want to purchase everyday items here due to the high prices, and prefer to buy them in their hometowns. This is especially true for women. Even a small piece of cloth will be taken back to their hometown, unwilling to give it up. Furthermore, due to the lack of supplies in the countryside, such as cotton cloth, towels, foreign-made goods, soap, and matches, they will inevitably prepare to bring some with them, fearing a shortage in the countryside. However, these items are all under control. Often, when the wharves are inspected, those carrying two extra towels or two pairs of foreign socks are immediately taken out and confiscated. Such strict restrictions are a hardship for those evacuating. If families with many children or those who have not returned to their hometowns for many years are carrying daily necessities for their own use and to give to relatives and friends, the quantity often exceeds the limit. In the minds of those carrying them, they still feel that what they are carrying is not enough. In reality, carrying two towels or two pairs of foreign socks can lead to confiscation. For example, for cotton clothing materials, the limit seems to be three yards per person, but in practice, it is difficult to carry even one yard. If based on need, a man's robe requires thirteen feet of material, and a woman's robe requires nine feet. In the minds of those evacuating back to their hometowns, returning today and not knowing when they will return to Shanghai, bringing a piece of clothing material back home is normal. However, one piece of clothing material already exceeds the three-yard limit and can be confiscated by law. Furthermore, if a family of six returns to their hometown at the same time, can the amount of clothing material they carry be combined according to the limit of eighteen yards? This also becomes a problem in reality. Therefore, the restrictions on luggage carried by evacuating citizens returning to their hometowns should be relaxed.</p>
<p>All citizens evacuating back to their hometowns must register with the police station in their jurisdiction beforehand. In addition to registering, the police station should immediately issue a return home permit or "evacuation certificate," and send the list of evacuated people to the evacuation committee daily to facilitate the allocation of transportation. Another copy of the list should be sent to the distribution office to stop rations. After the evacuation committee receives the list from the police station, it will reasonably allocate transportation according to the order of registration, the evacuation route, and the requested transportation. The evacuees will not suffer from the lack of boats or cars, and the authorities can also understand the evacuation situation on each route and the total number of evacuees. In addition to specifying the name, gender, age, place of origin, route, and number of luggage items in the return home permit "or evacuation certificate," it should also indicate that the police and military police along the way should provide preferential treatment and protection and should not cause difficulties. At the same time, the municipal government should separately send letters to the police and military police agencies in various locations, requesting that they provide effective protection for the evacuated people returning to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Again, the number of means of transportation should be increased. In addition to increasing the number of trains on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways and the number of ships on the outer sea and Yangtze River lines, efforts should also be made to increase inland waterway and long-distance buses. In addition, private boats and vehicles should be used on a large scale to ensure that evacuating citizens do not suffer from the inability to leave and the difficulty of moving through the crowds. Other issues, such as restricting individual porters from occupying transportation and selling tickets on the black market, are also within the scope of rectifying transportation and should be resolved together.</p>
<p>Finally, reducing the fare for the evacuating citizens and subsidizing the travel expenses for poor citizens who cannot afford to return to their hometowns are also important issues. If the municipal government and relevant parties can reasonably resolve the above issues, it is expected that the government's plan to evacuate one million citizens will not be difficult to achieve.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Population Evacuation</h3>
<p>— Lu Feng</p>
<p>Wartime Shanghai has too many people. Currently, with the advancement of the war, all transportation and production forces are restricted, but the number of consumers has not decreased. In a state of demand exceeding supply, prices are soaring, and people's livelihoods are insecure. This large population residing in Shanghai not only does not contribute to production but also affects public security. In addition, if Shanghai is subject to air raids, the issue of population evacuation is an urgent matter.</p>
<p>The municipal government has closely organized the Population Evacuation Committee, which is gathering wisdom and discussing comprehensive countermeasures. I believe that the following key points should be considered regarding this issue.</p>
<p>(1) Consider the smooth flow of transportation mechanisms</p>
<p>(2) Adopt a one-stop collective evacuation</p>
<p>(3) Strictly screen those who do not need to reside in Shanghai</p>
<p>(4) Study livelihood strategies for the evacuated population</p>
<p>First, the various restrictions on transportation mechanisms make people feel that the journey is difficult. Coupled with the rampant black market, even necessary travel is inconvenient. Therefore, regarding the evacuation of Shanghai's population, everything cannot proceed without maximizing the strengthening of transportation forces.</p>
<p>Second, charitable organizations, schools, religious groups, factories, and the like should be properly considered for relocation outside the city. The authorities should assist in their evacuation and provide various conveniences.</p>
<p>Third, vagrants without legitimate occupations should be strictly screened and evacuated outside the city.</p>
<p>Fourth, if the above-mentioned forcibly evacuated people cannot make a living outside the city or do not have new friends to assist them, their countermeasures after relocation should be sought. Currently, the policy of China participating in the war is to increase production as the primary task. Therefore, it may be considered to establish light industrial production organizations so that the evacuated population can work and live without waiting for death.</p>
<p>Of course, to make the evacuation of Shanghai's population of more than three million residents a reality, in addition to skillfully using various agencies, a large amount of economic expenditure to subsidize the consumption of the evacuated population is also necessary. This matter is of great importance and requires gathering wisdom and having various authorities and experts study and formulate comprehensive measures to implement it.</p>
<h3>Organization and Work of Evacuation Agencies</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yishan</p>
<p>The importance of population evacuation in wartime cities has attracted attention from all sides. The author returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, where the evacuated population accounted for about half of Hong Kong's population. Since the authorities organized an evacuation agency—the Homecoming Guidance Office—the work has been quite effective. Therefore, to evacuate the population, it is necessary to first establish a sound organization as an agency to guide the evacuation work, so that it can proceed step by step to achieve the expected results. Based on what I know about the organization and work of the Hong Kong "Homecoming Guidance Office," and incorporating my own opinions, I drafted the following outline of the Shanghai Municipal Homecoming Guidance Office.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>Production Guidance Committee</p>
<p>Economic Management Committee</p>
<p>Director—Secretary</p>
<p>General Affairs Department: Documents, Accounting, Affairs, Transportation, Transportation.</p>
<p>Organization Department: Investigation, Liaison, Registration, Organization, Discipline, Promotion.</p>
<p>Propaganda Department: Written Propaganda (Publications, Leaflets, Posters). Activities Propaganda (Drama, Movies, Invitations).</p>
<p>Public Relations</p>
<p>Accommodation Department: Management, Education, Inspection, Catering, Hygiene.</p>
<p>Work</p>
<p>Passive: Assistance and Relief</p>
<p>Active: Development and Production</p>
<p>Investigate the number: Start investigating the number of elderly, weak, women, and children in the city who must be evacuated, the small industrial schools that can be relocated, etc., divided into those who pay fees and those who are free, producers and consumers, etc., and listed in a table for reference.</p>
<p>Arrange and divide teams: According to the number of people known from the investigation, observe their economic and production situation, arrange and divide teams, stipulating the number of people per team, the destination of evacuation, the evacuation schedule, etc. So that they can contact the relevant parties in advance to obtain the convenience of daily necessities and accommodation.</p>
<p>Handle procedures on behalf: The various procedures that the evacuees must have will be handled uniformly by the office to achieve uniformity and speed.</p>
<p>Accommodation matters: After the evacuees have completed the various procedures and received the departure notice from the office, they must check into the accommodation designated by the office two days before departure. The accommodation will provide meals and accommodation, inspect luggage, and guide the evacuees on the necessary common praise and its significance. To avoid using the name of returning home to engage in smuggling.</p>
<p>Voluntary service: According to the evacuee's request, the office will voluntarily auction off unnecessary items fairly, in exchange for the necessary public-priced materials.</p>
<p>Separate assistance: After the evacuees arrive at their destination, the office will carry out work such as recommendations, assistance, and relief according to the situation at the time of the investigation, to avoid being stranded in a foreign land and affecting public security.</p>
<p>Prerequisites</p>
<p>It is necessary to unite the leaders of all industries in the city, organize a production guidance committee, and use idle funds to develop production undertakings at the evacuation destination so that evacuees do not lose their jobs.</p>
<p>The number of evacuees and the amount of luggage must be listed in a table, and the supply of transportation vehicles, the protection of residence along the way, and the convenience of various application procedures and inspections must be effectively discussed with the transportation and security authorities. So that the evacuees do not suffer material losses and mental pain.</p>
<p>It is necessary to obtain special rations of daily necessities from the relevant authorities so that they can be provided free of charge and rationed at public prices to the evacuees.</p>
<p>It is necessary to contact the local authorities in advance and establish homecoming reception centers in various places to provide voluntary services and to contact local industrial and commercial circles to arrange the work of evacuees.</p>
<p>The authorities must designate a location with convenient transportation as the address of the office, and the address of the accommodation should be divided into multiple locations, determined by the office according to the situation, mainly using public property.</p>
<p>Expenses</p>
<p>Expenses are divided into three types: government public funds, its own income, and fundraising donations.</p>
<h3>Why Evacuate the Population?</h3>
<p>— Gu Nanqun</p>
<p>I have never been good at speaking, and I am even worse at writing articles, so I rarely speak, and even less write articles. This time, the Shen Bao sent a letter requesting an article, so I had no choice but to stand on my own professional position and write a few words:</p>
<p>I am a doctor, and I cannot leave my profession in three sentences, so I have to say a few words about population evacuation based on my own professional experience.</p>
<p>Population evacuation, at this time and in this place, is really too necessary. The trend of the situation is certainly the main reason, but the difficulties in clothing, food, housing, and transportation caused by the war should also be evacuated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Why? During wartime, everything is subject to considerable restrictions, and clothing, food, housing, and transportation are no exception. The first two points, clothing and transportation, are not discussed much due to space limitations and also because they are outside the scope of what I am familiar with. Here, I will only talk about the two items related to my profession, food and housing, and it should be evacuated quickly.</p>
<p>First, during this period, prices will inevitably gradually skyrocket, and life will become increasingly difficult. Most citizens cannot even obtain enough food and clothing, let alone talk about proper nutrition. Therefore, most people suffer from malnutrition. Malnutrition makes it easy to get sick, so it is better to go to the countryside, which is easier to obtain. This is the first reason why evacuation should be done quickly from the food perspective.</p>
<p>Second is the housing problem. Because part of the city's houses were destroyed in the war and have not been restored to the pre-war scale, the population has increased instead. Therefore, except for a few houses where not many people live, most houses are extremely crowded. In this situation, the air is turbid, and diseases arise. According to the statistics of our Nanyang Hospital, the mortality rate of infectious and acute diseases has been higher in recent years than before, increasing from 2.3% to over 5%. Although it is not necessarily entirely accurate, it can be inferred that the air in the countryside is fresher. Although the sanitation facilities are not complete, it is very rare for so many people to be crammed into a small house, unless they are extremely poor people without even a tile. This is the second reason why evacuation should be done quickly.</p>
<p>Third, we must talk about the destructive power of modern scientific warfare explosives. Everyone knows that modern warfare is very cruel. According to newspapers and magazines, the situation in several major cities in Europe being bombed is simply terrible. Just take what we have heard and seen to report, and it is enough to be shocking. Around May of last year, workers in an iron shop near the former Beile Road in the old Eighth District mistakenly recognized a purchased bomb as an old iron block and exploded it when hitting it. At that time, more than a dozen people were seriously injured and sent to our Nanyang Hospital for treatment. Some were blown open and their flesh was rotten, some had incomplete limbs, and some were scorched all over. Among them, three people died soon due to their serious injuries, and two or three people who were less seriously injured became disabled after being cured. I believe that the citizens of this city will not ignore this situation just because they have not experienced it themselves! But this is only a small bomb. The destructive power of high-altitude bombing, which is more powerful and more frightening than these, is of course even more unimaginable; even its destructive power sometimes exceeds the extent to which our doctors can treat it. This is the third reason why evacuation should be done quickly.</p>
<p>The above three points, as long as we quietly imagine, leaving this city is really too urgent and too necessary. It is certainly impossible to completely avoid the fluctuations of war, but the countryside is safer than the city, which is an undeniable fact. I sincerely advise my compatriots who think it is not necessary to stay in this city, leave this city as soon as possible! An ancient proverb tells us: "In small turmoil, live in the city; in large turmoil, live in the countryside." This is a wise proverb for self-preservation that has been experienced in the bloody lessons of war, and I hope that all citizens of the city will quickly assess the situation and take care of themselves.</p>
<h3>Dongting Mountain as a Discussion Area for Shanghai Citizens to Evacuate</h3>
<p>— Xiang Kangyuan</p>
<p>Shanghai's population is too concentrated. Not only is there a need for evacuation in air defense during periods of tense war, but also in terms of the soaring prices of rice roots and fuel, it is necessary to persuade some agencies and households to move to other places to find food. Now the municipal government has organized a committee to handle evacuation matters. I would like to contribute my humble opinions for discussion:</p>
<p>We can deduce that some citizens whose old homes are in neighboring provinces and cities are willing to move back to their old homes; because according to the ordinary situation, the connection between individuals and their family, friends, and assets in their place of origin is generally closer than in other places. If you move back to your old home, everything will be easier. These citizens only need to be assisted by the municipal authorities in terms of transportation, and they can happily go there without any other problems, so it is easier to handle. However, another part of the citizens whose place of origin is in Shanghai, or whose place of origin is very far away and cannot return home, or whose place of origin is in a neighboring area but cannot return due to other difficulties, then the municipal authorities, in addition to solving transportation problems, must also find places to move to for resettlement. Now I propose Dongting West Mountain in Wu County as the evacuation site for these people, and I will elaborate on the reasons and methods as follows:</p>
<p>A. The Environment of Dongting Mountain: Dongting Mountain is under the jurisdiction of Wu County, standing alone in Taihu Lake, with fertile land and beautiful folk customs. Because it is isolated from the mainland, it is not easy for the war to affect it. Not only is it an ideal refuge in wartime, but it is also a beautiful residential area in peacetime. It is rich in fruits, tea, fish, shrimp, and vegetables, and it is not far from the county seat of Wu County, so the supply of food is also very convenient. This mountain and nearby areas are rich in bamboo and wood. If you want to build simple houses to accommodate the people who move there, the materials can be taken locally, which is very easy. The Taihu Lake coast is rich in reeds. Therefore, the daily fuel of the mountain people can be taken infinitely.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of Dongting Mountain at present is that Han security is not guaranteed. But I think things depend on people. If the immigrants have sufficient financial resources and are well-organized, the bandits on the mountain and in the lake are nothing more than a sore on the foot, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them soon. The British book New Year's Pass in Hong Kong is a good example.</p>
<p>B. The Method of Moving to Dongting Mountain: The Population Evacuation Committee of this city should quickly contact the Wu County Government and the Dongting Mountain Hometown Association in Shanghai, first investigate the houses available for residence in West Mountain, estimate the number of people who can be moved there, and stipulate the amount of fees to be paid per person (the first batch is assumed to be 500,000 yuan per person). Then announce to the citizens that anyone who is willing to evacuate to the mountain should apply for registration at the designated location. Assuming that 100,000 people move to the mountain in the first batch, the Wu County Government will specially form a Dongting Mountain Administration Bureau (or it can be reorganized and expanded by the district office of the mountain) to be responsible for organizing the civil affairs of the mountain. For example, distributing housing, rationing food, ensuring public security, etc., first build the mountain into an area where good people can live and work in peace, and then registered citizens can rest assured to go there and sit back and relax.</p>
<p>At present, it is more difficult to obtain land transportation tools than water transportation; Fortunately, from Shanghai to the mountain, you can hire a dedicated small wheel to tow civilian ships, so the transportation problem is not difficult to solve. Along the way, the tax police regiment should also send armed escorts to ensure safety. After the first batch of 100,000 people goes to the mountain, the second evacuation of citizens will be decided. This will be continued until the population on the mountain reaches the saturation point. But we believe that the amount of fees to be paid by the second and subsequent batches of people going to the mountain should be reduced batch by batch so that those with less power can also enjoy this right. There are also some groups and populations that the municipal government believes must be forcibly moved out of the city, then it is not only possible to evacuate them free of charge, but even to give them subsidies to go to the mountain. This method is tantamount to allowing those with less power to enjoy the light of those with more power, and also to have the opportunity to move to the mountain; only those with more power have a slight priority in the evacuation process.</p>
<p>C. The Civil Affairs of Dongting Mountain: The civil affairs on the mountain should adopt a considerable degree of autonomy. In addition to the Management Bureau, a Civil Affairs Association should be formed by the mountain people to stipulate that certain political contributions should be reviewed and agreed by the Association in advance before they can be implemented; certain facilities should be jointly responsible by the Association to assist the Management Bureau, especially the security guard, in addition to maintaining a strong standing team, the mountain people should actively participate in training and develop self-defense forces, so that the military and civilians can contact each other and respond flexibly, and it is easy to achieve macro effects in defense.</p>
<p>Finance is the driving force behind all undertakings. Opening Dongting West Mountain as a relocation area for Shanghai citizens should be based on the premise of having strong financial resources. Cleaning up bandits, organizing roads, adding new houses, maintaining security guard forces, etc., all require huge expenses before they can be held. The above article proposes that the Shanghai citizens going to the mountain must first pay a fee of 500,000 yuan per person. The total number of 100,000 people in the first batch has reached 50 billion yuan. In addition, the fees paid by subsequent batches of people going to the mountain seem to be very large; but considering the vastness of the expenses required to organize public security, it seems that only this is enough to succeed.</p>
<p>The livelihood problem of Shanghai citizens after moving to the mountain should also be planned in advance. In addition to relying on their own property or relying on remittances from other places, the Management Bureau may as well designate a considerable area of open space to recruit people to rent, so that they can plant fruit trees or vegetables for the mountain's consumption; if the harvest is abundant and the transportation is available, they may as well sell it to other places in exchange for food. In addition, those with special skills, such as those who study medicine, can practice medicine; those who study education can open schools; those who are good at trading can engage in trade between neighboring areas and the mountain, etc. All can do what they can and get what they need.</p>
<p>In short, the plan to open up Dongting Mountain and relocate Shanghai citizens is quite complicated and arduous; but if the government and the people work together and persevere, it is not difficult to promote its realization in the short term. We must not run the mountain as a temporary set for wartime avoidance, but should adhere to the policy of a century-old plan, that is, even after peacetime, we should continue to run it, carry it forward, and create a beautiful residential area in Taihu Lake, which will shine with the Xlangyu, Gulangyu, and Moganshan managed by foreigners, then the manpower and financial resources spent now will not be in vain?</p>
