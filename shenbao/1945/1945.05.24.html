<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本海軍魂（其一）</h3>
<p>為亞洲十億民族吐氣揚眉的日本海海戰，轉瞬已經四十年了！四十年前的五月二十七日，不僅是日本海軍最光榮的日子，而且也是亞洲民族共有的紀念日。當此大東亞戰爭決戰的最後階段，日本忠勇卓越的海軍又巳站在太平洋的第一綫，為日本帝國和東亞全體民族的命運而發揮其「海軍魂」的精神。</p>
<p>日本海軍在四十年來所保持「常勝無敵」的光榮傳統，實際上正是所謂「海軍魂」的表現。這種海軍魂，決不是平常字典上的字所能形容，而完全以國民與將士之愛國熱忱之事實表現出來的。</p>
<p>「海軍魂」最先表現在四十年前的五月二十七日下午，當時日本海面濛濛中巳醖釀着歷史的戰頌，西北風一陣一陣的吹拂，敵艦隊突然在日本旗艦三笠之南微西約七浬地點出現了，黃色的州突，像兩條長蛇般的二列縱隊，漸漸向日陣進逼了，在這千鈞一髮的時候，東鄕司令長官即向全軍頒發開始戰鬥令，一時五十五分，日本旗艦的彩旗檣上飛揚起千載不朽的戰訓：</p>
<p>皇國興廢在此一戰！</p>
<p>各員加倍奮勵努力！</p>
<p>全體日軍在這號令之下，士氣激昂，人人心底燃起盡忠獻身為國殲敵的熱焰，就在此「海軍魂」的激盪之下，猛烈進擊，而出現了世界歷史最光榮的勝利。</p>
<p>後來有人請問東鄕元帥，這樣偉大的勝利究竟怎樣造成的呢？東鄕元帥的答復是「御神助與御稜威」幾個字。不過，雖曰天意，要亦人事奮鬥的結果。</p>
<p>我們今日檢討日本海軍當時勝利的原因有幾點不容忽視。</p>
<p>第一，自日淸一戰以後，日本新生的海軍雖然戰勝了龐大而腐敗的滿淸水師，但是當時國際上對日本的情勢非常險惡，致有三國干涉逼近遼東半島的故事，那時日本全國在此辛辣的刺　之下，朝野上下，無不燃起强化海軍力以求雪恥的要求，所謂「海軍魂」則自此開始。集中力量於新海軍之建設，奠定了勝利的基礎。</p>
<p>第二，當然是東鄕元帥以大日本海軍將帥英明的指揮力，而這種指揮力，又是積歷次作戰經騐及對敵調查硏究的結果。東鄕元帥自己曾强調指出：日俄開戰後初期作戰中的黃海這役，曾獲許多寶貴的經騐，硏究結果，進行猛烈的訓練，在戰略戰術上都有了極重大的改善。同時如東鄕元帥，早在日淸戰後任海軍大學校長時，曾親自反熟讀俄將馬喀羅夫所著的「海戰論」，加以詳細的批評及添註自己的意見，直到五二七日本海戰一仗獲勝那天，在旗艦三笠之長官室椅上，還放着部譯書！</p>
<p>第三，就是全體軍人為國盡忠戰到最後一瞬的「海軍魂」，從將帥到士卒，無一人不抱着不勝不休的戰鬥精神，絕不作最後勝利以外的任何讓步的打算。他們以死於作戰最前綫為最大的光榮，也以為國犧牲為人生最大愉快，所謂「各員粉身碎骨，完成其任務」勇往直前決無反顧的精神。而後方國民亦莫不齊心協力，抱着同樣的精神，以協力於作戰。</p>
<p>日本的「海軍魂」在四十年前的歷史上寫下最光榮的一頁，而今日，當太平洋的敵人又向日本近海迫近的時候，我們瞧着吧，他們在日本「海軍魂」下將遭受怎樣的結果。日前在日本海岸外十六浬被毀的美國航空母艦「富蘭克林」號，只是序幕而已。</p>
<h3>敵作戰企圖之解剖　日駐華艦隊報道部</h3>
<p>— 松本大尉</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>勇戰五年有餘之德國，終於功虧一簣，陷於無條件投降之悲運，今日歐洲戰綫，巳高嗚休戰之喇叭，世界戰局，正如愛爾蘭首相在本月二十日演說中所稱：「現在戰爭尙未告終，諸小國正靜得大國之解決本身間相尅，戰爭現正進入第二個階段。」但從軍事上言，戰爭可謂巳移到太平洋。</p>
<p>現於太平洋方面戰爭中之日本對英美決戰，其中心為以尼米資太平洋艦隊為中心之琉球作戰，以麥克沃塞之美國陸軍為基幹之呂宋民大那峨泰拉干等地作戰，以及阿諾特元帥所率領之太平洋戰域，美陸軍航空部隊尤其羅美少將部下之戰略轟炸機隊之對日轟炸，及沿岸封鎖作戰，以及蒙特巴頓之英印軍及英國印度洋艦隊東南亞洲作戰。此外，駐渝美第十四航空隊及近代化重慶軍之大陸作戰亦可列入。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>尼米資反攻，又名「蛙飛作戰」，別名「跳島作戰」，及「飛石作戰」係依據幾何級數，於馬金泰拉瓦，克愛奧林，羅沃德，塞班，迭尼安，大宮，帛琉，硫黃，冲繩島等作飛躍的進攻，攷其本質，殆含有投機性，不外為投急謀短期決戰之美國輿論之好。</p>
<p>麥克沃塞攻勢，有「基地前進作戰」之稱，係依照算術級數，向所羅門，新幾內亞，披亞克，摩洛泰，雷伊泰，民大諾，呂宋，民大那峨，蘇祿羣島，泰拉干等地徐徐前進，雖嫌緩慢，不失為脚踏實地之戰法，此法雖無視美國國內輿論，堪稱完全由軍事的見地，步行確實之路徑。</p>
<p>太平洋戰域美陸軍航空部隊，為馬里亞納基地之第二十航空隊（B29轟炸機隊），及菲島基地之第五，第十三航空隊，前者在上年十月開始對日轟炸時，來襲機數僅為三—四十架，次數亦僅每月一—二次。邇後由於駐渝空軍基地方面空軍之調用，生產增强（本年一月生產額為一百三十五架，最近月產二百架。）及基地之整理，急謀空襲日本上及封鎖日本沿岸。後者除謀整備克拉克菲爾種基地外，主要集合B24轟炸機，從事於大陸沿岸之封鎖及航行這遮斷，兩者今後之戰略，雖其空軍遭日軍之猛攻，損失慘重，仍有嚴為戒備之必要。</p>
<p>蒙特巴頓部下之東南亞洲軍，為作為太平洋全域對日總反攻之一環而新編者，照和十八年遭遇日緬甸遠征軍之先發攻擊，印緬國境遽吿失守，一時哄傳世界，認為笑話。昭和十九年夏以後，因空軍之整備擴充，美式渝軍之援助逐漸反守為攻，自本年起竟爾實行以仰光為目標之南下攻勢，今後之趨勢，實與英印度洋艦隊之蠢動相同，亦有嚴加戒備之必要。</p>
<p>最後重慶軍之裝備近代化，頗値注意，其功效雖未如其對外宣傳者，但因史蒂威爾公路之建築及空輸部隊之活躍，預料至明年春天，可整備四十個師團，一朝大陸作戰本格化時，自將發揮相當之功效。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>敵方宣傳將以歐洲軍事力向太平洋移動，幷急於欲求其實現，然因由於英美蘇複雜微妙關係之國際政治關係，以及船隻不足，基地缺少之戰略上理由，至調用兵力亦有一定限度，如判斷其數量及時機，則對於太平洋方面戰局所及影響，目前不致甚大。</p>
<p>光就海軍兵力言，英美方面艦隊，其大部殆巳於歐洲戰爭結束前參加太平洋作戰，所剩者僅一部份英艦隊而巳。再以陸軍兵力言，美國在歐陸軍，第一綫兵力七十萬，後方部隊約三百萬，在易北河綫與蘇軍四百萬接境，亦以船隻不足，預料能調至太平洋成為第一綫兵力，大致在本年十月可調七師十二萬兵力。至明年四月可有三十師計五十萬兵力，因之調動動陸軍力暫時不能如敵軍所宣傳之龐大。</p>
<p>最後關於航空兵力，比較可以迅速調動，如歐美空軍司令官史拔茲所稱，空軍雖受基地不足之限制，但亦須調用約為目下二倍之空軍，尤其考慮到敵方在菲島以及佔領島嶼基地積極從事凖備，以及甚可利用在華基地等點，則其空軍力之增强，固不容輕視者。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>然則敵方今後之作戰，將在何種企圖下採取保種形態？</p>
<p>第一，尼米茲戰略在冲繩島已漸發生破綻，因日軍特攻隊及航空隊猛攻，敵海上部隊被殲泰半，該島日軍守備隊奮勇作戰，敵登陸軍第十軍巳損失過半，戰局呈膠着狀態，進擊完全受阻，敵方為打開此僵局，或將展開「强力制敵」之新作戰。據前綫報道班員消息：「敵機動部隊有北上之微兆」。此或可視為新作戰之前奏，敵方所稱「為突入日本本土，更必須數處基地」，以及再從敵陸海軍兵力現况觀察，敵方之進攻目標，可以揣測為其所謂「走向本土的跳板」，亦即能利用為航空基地之小島嶼。</p>
<p>麥克沃塞及韋特曼之所指目標，當然在東南亞洲，此亦可評為英美凖備長期作戰之「分支作戰」，於整個戰局上所占比重較低。</p>
<p>如以此上所述，尼米茲之跳島戰法已吿停頓，發生破綻，麥克沃塞以前大聲疾呼之大陸登陸作戰，亦以兵力及船隻受限制，今日難以立即實現。目前敵軍主要作戰可說在戰略轟炸戰。紐約時報論說記者秀蘭德曾提出警告稱：「美陸海軍參謀本部亦明知不能以危險手段，使日本屈服，故必須樹立長期作戰計劃，於今日即使以勝負為一大賭博亦當失敗」。言詞中暗示責難在過去硫黃島大流血，及冲繩島苦鬥中尼米茲戰法。又尼料茲在公布德國投降後接見記者團時，亦曾述稱：「吾人預期從歐洲方面必有空軍來援，但在該戰區並無足以容納此大量飛機之飛機塲，故必須充分努力，俾能予以容納。（中略）然吾人如有必要，則將樹立侵略日本之計畫按步實行」。此可證明彼以本土作戰視為資要者，先決條件必須强行航空殲滅戰，尤如陸軍航空部隊指揮官阿諾特，於三月廿九日聲稱：「美國擬使用全部飛機，俾能廣範圍將破壞日本工業使東亞戰事早日結束。」。又前在歐洲曾任美第八航空隊司令，此次調任太平　洋方面要職之特里托爾，於五月十一日稱：「吾人基本戰略，在施行空襲，削弱敵人勢力，俾使陸上部隊能得佔領地點，吾人獲得飛機塲與航空兵員，並確立接濟路綫與連絡基地第和，當可擴大空襲日本之範圍」。關於敵軍此項企圖，吾人須有認識。</p>
<p>要之，敵今後戰敗企圖，暫時並非在大陸登陸作戰，亦非日本本土登陸作戰，乃為戰略轟炸與東南亞洲之反攻戰，此可表示敵人巳從短期作戰。而變計劃為長期長戰，然因舊金山會議觸及暗礁，殖民地處理問題發生糾紛，對德處理方針未能一致，在波蘭·奧地利亞·南斯拉夫等國爭奪勢力行等國際上的波蘭，以及食糧恐慌，民需孔殷人力缺乏，和平空氣濃厚。凡此現象暴露出國內矛盾，故敵美長期作戰必將發生破縱，吾人應始終忍耐，毅然與英美周旋到底，為獲得取後勝利而勇戰敢鬥。</p>
<h3>王長答記者問</h3>
<p>北平二十三日中央社電　政委會王委員長，昨會見中日記者，首由王委長談此次視察濟南之印象，略謂，本人以為如常至各地視察，可與各地人士交談，多得各地方實際情形，以為參考，同時有多數事件可就地解決，故今後或將至各地視察。繼由各記者發問，王委員長均即詳細解答，大意如次：問，關於日本大東亞省召開駐中國大使公使會議之意義？答，日本對中國之施策，仍堅持旣定方針，支援中國完成統一及自主獨立，以政治平等，經濟互惠原則，確立中日親善關係，克服一切障礙。本來政治平等，經濟互惠原則，乃政府不變之方針，人民一致之希望，日本之方針如此，中國之希望亦如此。問，關於各地治安問題及保安隊，緩靖軍問題，是否巳有整頓之辦法？答，治安問題當然應特別注意，本來華北　各地情形相當複雜，而保護綏靖地方之軍隊，今後應從速着手整頓，地方治安良好，其他一切開發增產的工作，亦必隨之有好成績。問，關於靑少年，民意政治等貴見如何？答，本人注意靑少年問題，並非由現在起，以往即然，巳見於本人吿靑年書中及其他談話中表示，茲不贅述。其次民意政治問題，古云「得民者昌，失民者亡」，以及本人於宣言中有言曰「有人民才有政治，無人民即無政府」，此為中國傳統政治理念，專制封建時代，尙且注意民意問題，况在今日</p>
<h3>英首相邱吉爾昨突然辭職</h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據路透社報吿：英首相邱吉爾於二十三日宣布辭職。倫敦唐寗街十號發出官方布吿謂，邱吉爾首相於該日下午謁見英王後即行辭職。</p>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據路透社報吿：英王二十三日接見邱吉爾，一般人均希望在邱吉爾晋謁英王之後，當局必將有一關於英王接受邱吉爾欲解散國會要求之官方布吿，同時該項布吿將於三星期內頒發。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　據路透社政治訪員昨日談稱：若三頭會議不能在英國總選舉之前召開，邱吉爾首相恐未能以英國代表之資格，得與特魯曼·史太林會見。然保守黨能一日得勝，則邱吉爾將仍能領導英國作戰，反之，若勞工黨獲勝，則彼等必將請求英王授命代理首相阿特里重組內閣，但自由黨一旦獲勝，則該黨之領袖現任航空部長辛克萊，將負起全英國興亡之重任。</p>
<h3>拒絕權問題民開激辯　舊金山會又一難里</h3>
<p>里期本二十二日中央社電　據舊金山來電：使舊金山會議分為丙倍之拒絕權問題，二十二日愈迫最大危機，中小各國曾發動全勢力，與五大國展開最後雄辯，各專門家為掃除千國國際憲章與各大國之拒絕權之意見對立，曾特別盡力解說。其爭論要點如次：五大國際除被一般承認，以軍事手段對實際行動有拒絕權外，是否尙有實行　際安全保障理事會之調停活動，及和平解決措置之權利，各小國大部對給與五大國廣大範圍之拒絕權尙加反對。此項紛爭要點，蓋因鄧巴頓奧克斯案及雅爾達案，對各大國使用拒絕權之正確地域，並未確定故也，英首席代表艾登外長之代理外交次官賈德幹，上週會聲明謂，英國擁有拒絕討論及調查紛爭事件權利，美國雖應允大國有拒絕推荐及行動權利，然為使世界與論支持和平及保障安全，故討論之自由及調查之自由，乃極重要事。蘇聯及美國對此論調，雖未正式表明反對，然蘇聯報紙上早已表露不同意之態度，現各小國欲知五國聲明如何解決此種問題，國際安全保障理事會討議問題中，何者通用拒絕權，何者不通用，大國提案時引用憲章一節說明，然五大國共同聲明成立前，並未慮及使用拒絕權問題。</p>
<h3>勞工建議大國反對</h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據路透社特派記者談稱：關於要求世界安全保障機構應負責「推進世界上一切工作」之勞工建議，在舊金山會議中，曾遭各大國反對，該項勞工建議雖於日前得「經濟社會會作委員會」主席印代表團領袖莫代拉翰之同意，然引起美代表團極大反感，彼等曾對此施打擊，略謂：「此世界安全保障機構，乃國際間之政府，何以能幹一國一家之工作」。</p>
<p>義境英美軍採取武力行動　南軍未抵抗退出佔領區</p>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據托里埃斯特來電傳稱：義大利戰綫之英第八軍及美第五軍，二十二日在糾紛地區之威尼斯地方開始行動，向南斯拉夫邊境派軍隊進駐。據合衆社電稱，英·美軍進駐時，南斯拉夫軍未加抵抗。英·美目佔領地域，此固極為顯著，當蒂托正欲解決此項紛爭時，英·美兩國竟採取武力行動，前途頗値重視。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　據合衆社獲自托里埃斯特之消息稱：托里埃斯特之領域紛爭益見嚴重，駐於義大利東北部之英美軍隊，已開入南斯拉夫邊境綫內，英第八軍於美第二軍增援後，巳開始佔領自托里埃斯特北至柯里薩東方五里之地點，同時正深入紛爭已入之威尼斯·干里阿，該項佔領城市包括斯賓諾山地及塔諾伐等，英美方面採取此種舉動，已表明不顧蒂托將軍最近之讓步，而欲粉碎和平之希望。</p>

<h3>無錫安鎭近况　羅漢齋</h3>
<p>無錫工商薈萃，素有小上海之稱，而安鎭（無錫一鄕鎭）又有小無錫之稱，安鎭別稱「膠山」，（蓋因其西面，有一座名膠山的土山故名，位於縣城東北，鄰近蕩口鎭。這個鄕鎭之所以稱「安」，因為道裏的居民，大多數是姓安的緣故。</p>
<h3>交通·農業</h3>
<p>安鎭在戰前，陸有錫澄公路的長途公共汽車，和獨輪車，人力車的交織，水路（運河）有汽油輪拖行的客船，和帶航信兼載搭客的航船，往來城鄕。旅客欲搭乘京滬路的火車，也是非常便利的。事變後的安鎭交通，便大不同，無論長途汽車，或汽輪，都因缺乏了汽油和火油，而相繼停頓，如今水路方面，代之而興的，是使用木炭引擎的輪船，和往來如梭的航船。安鎭和錫城相距祗短短三十里的路程，票價也需數千元，郵政方面僅有郵政代辦所一處。這是因為航信較郵信更為發達之故。</p>
<p>安鎭在戰前，家家戶戶，都以育蠶植桑情形一變，因為農作物如稻，麥等的價格步步上漲，於是紛紛翻桑田為稻田，育蠶的盛况，巳成過去。其他營猪·鴨·牛·羊·養鷄·養魚的也很多。</p>
<h3>商業·敎育</h3>
<p>這裏的店面，鱗次櫛比，布店洋廣雜貨店，藥舗，紙烟店和醬油精坊店，肉店等甚多，而茶館酒菜館，點心店等也很不少，因為安鎭人歡最喜小吃，其著名可口的點心是肉麵，包子，拖爐餅，玉蘭餅，他們在勞作之餘，或坐在茶龍裏品銘淸談，或走上酒菜館，借酒澆愁，樂以忘憂，一條安鎭待上呼朋引類，肩摩嚴擊。</p>
<p>在安鎭私熟很多，至於學校現在鎭上僅有安鎭小學一所，是一完全小學，敎員多女性，敎授相當認眞，現有學生三百餘人。</p>
<h3>治安·宗敎</h3>
<p>治安方面在戰前有警察分局，分駐所，安鎭商團等，自經戰亂，安鎭曾遭兵燹，居民流離失所，宵小潛伏，雖有日本分駐派遣隊和警察協力鎭壓，除鎭待熱鬧之區，尙安靜外，僻村閭巷伏莽仍多倡獗。近有一天仙佛會，傳佈至廣，謠稱坐道功深，可以刀槍不入，蠱惑愚民。某日，該會拂堂，被匪人搗毀，雙方結夥對壘，互相殘殺，中途即遭匪人殺害，情形甚慘，天仙佛會得訊，出動大批人馬征剿，故鄕風鶴頻驚，簡直不敢出門一步。安鎭治安前途，洵堪憂慮，希望負有地方治安責任的警政當局，從速充實警衛實力，以保障在苦難中的居民生命財產。</p>

<h3>蘇省積極推進　戰時建設工作　諮詢委員會陳彬龢氏談</h3>
<p>本市諸詢委員陳彬龢氏，為與江蘇省當局接洽農貸事宜，日昨奉派赴蘇，中央社記者叩詢接洽經過情形，已誌昨報，陳氏作夜以蘇省當局對於蘇省建設概况見告，特誌大概如次：</p>
<p>蘇省建設，經任省長與孫應長之重視，正在積極推進預定計劃。蘇省建設應之任務，不僅担任建設工程，並對於增加生產工作·亦在職準範圍。任省長之意，平時固須建設，戰時亦應建設。惟在戰時建設，應以儘可能不增加人民痛苦爲主。江蘇省建設工作，更以不唱高調，實事求是，做一件是一伴。最近進行中之建設工作有下列數種：</p>
<p>修築公路</p>
<p>公路橋樑之修築，定有監理六六幹路之工程計劃，包括蘇常，蘇嘉，蘇滬，常太，崑太，錫常等入綫，蘇滬公路則開闢新綫，與鐵道綫並行，較原公路錢縮短三分之一，適於本人昨日赴蘇之日開工，約歷兩個月全工完成。</p>
<p>省會市政工程之修結，早經擬定計劃，近正逐步實施，如整理路面油渠，改建橋樑，修繕城牆公園等等。</p>
<p>促進增產工作，利用蘇嘉鐵路沿綫隙地，種植食糧，現正丈量測勘，分區　植。</p>
<p>建築戰時工程，如省會及各縣城區，建築防空壕，各縣鄉鎭，開掘壕溝，建築土堡，以利自衛。</p>
<p>開發西山</p>
<p>開闢洞庭西山自治模範區，自滬市工商界訪問團前往實地參觀後，省當局擬劃定該區為自治模範區，政務廳及各有關部份正積極計劃中，希望上海慈善機關，學校，工廠等疏散前往，或就地經營，尤盼滬市企業界組織投資集團，前往投資開發，省府方而將聘請資望識騐較高之士前去主持。</p>
<p>一般財政機關對於發放各機關經費，抱故意延擱之態度，但江蘇財政廳對於發放建設敎育種種經費，不但絕不延擱而且常常催領。</p>
<p>最後，任省長對於中日之間協力問題，表示欣慰，凡在戰時軍事上必要之舉，省當局極端協力辦理，惟以減少人民不必要之苦育為前提。如最近因收買棉花，由省府之充分協力，收效甚速，人民並無怨言，此爲中國方而表示誠意協助，日本方面表示信任，因能事半功倍之明證。</p>

<h3>從「救救孩子」說起</h3>
<p>兒童是明日社會的主人翁。未來社會的良劵成敗，都寄托在今日兒童身上。因此，社會人士重親慈幼事業，關心兒童健康，原是無可疵議的。但是，社會對於稱爲「兒童保姆」的小學敎師們，雖也相當重視，畢竟因爲生活負担的重壓，總是困苦不堪。</p>
<p>兒童猶是初生的植物，敎師當然是職司耕耘的農夫了。大家都希望初生植物茁壯長大而獲有一次豐滿的秋收的，在這個目標之下，除了注視氣候士地等適宜與否外，如何使耕耘的農天健康安樂而勤於耕種，將是一個極重耍的課題。可是，衡諸目前敎師生活，大多是陷入於飢寒疾病深淵下呻吟着。</p>
<p>社會賦予小學教師們以「百年樹人」的神聖使命，是決不能目覩敎師們艱苦遭遇而袖手旁觀的；同樣一個生龍活虎般的健全兒童，決不能够在飢塞交迫下的敎師們敎導之下，所能產生的。這是誰都不能否定的。</p>
<p>社會重視兒童，關注兒童，我們毫無疵議，可是，我們要求社會對敎師們，也能够給予同樣的注視和關懷。有了優良的教師，才能有完美的教育；有了完美的敎育，才能產生健全的兒童！（波）</p>

<h3>The Japanese Naval Spirit (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Forty years have passed in the blink of an eye since the Battle of Tsushima in the Sea of Japan, a battle that gave voice and pride to the billion people of Asia! May 27th, forty years ago, was not only the most glorious day for the Japanese Navy but also a shared memorial day for the Asian people. At this final stage of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, the loyal and outstanding Japanese Navy once again stands on the front line of the Pacific, embodying the spirit of the "Naval Spirit" for the fate of the Japanese Empire and all the peoples of East Asia.</p>
<p>The glorious tradition of "ever-victorious and invincible" maintained by the Japanese Navy over the past forty years is, in fact, a manifestation of the so-called "Naval Spirit." This Naval Spirit cannot be described by words in ordinary dictionaries but is fully expressed in the facts of the patriotism of the nation and its soldiers.</p>
<p>The "Naval Spirit" was first manifested on the afternoon of May 27th, forty years ago. At that time, the Japanese sea was shrouded in mist, brewing a historical battle hymn. The northwest wind blew in gusts, and the enemy fleet suddenly appeared about seven nautical miles south-southwest of the Japanese flagship Mikasa. The yellow state suddenly looked like two long serpents in two rows, gradually closing in on the Japanese formation. At this critical moment, Commander-in-Chief Tōgō issued an order to the entire army to begin the battle. At 1:55 PM, the immortal battle instructions fluttered on the color flag halyard of the Japanese flagship:</p>
<p>The rise or fall of the Empire depends on this battle!</p>
<p>All personnel, double your efforts!</p>
<p>Under this order, the morale of the entire Japanese army was high, and the enthusiasm to devote themselves to the country and annihilate the enemy burned in the hearts of everyone. Under the agitation of this "Naval Spirit," they launched a fierce attack, and the most glorious victory in world history emerged.</p>
<p>Later, someone asked Marshal Tōgō how such a great victory was achieved. Marshal Tōgō replied with the words "Divine assistance and imperial power." However, although it is said to be divine will, it is also the result of human struggle.</p>
<p>Today, when we examine the reasons for the Japanese Navy's victory at that time, there are several points that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>First, after the Sino-Japanese War, although the newly reborn Japanese Navy defeated the large and corrupt Qing Dynasty Navy, the international situation for Japan at that time was very treacherous, leading to the story of the Three-Power Intervention forcing the Qing to cede the Liaodong Peninsula. At that time, under this harsh sting, the entire country, from the court to the people, was ignited with the demand to strengthen the naval power to seek revenge. The so-called "Naval Spirit" began from this point. Concentrating efforts on the construction of the new navy laid the foundation for victory.</p>
<p>Second, of course, it was the brilliant command of the marshals and generals of the Great Japanese Navy, and this command power was the result of accumulating battle experience and studying the enemy. Marshal Tōgō himself emphasized that the Battle of the Yellow Sea in the early stages of the Russo-Japanese War provided many valuable experiences. After research, fierce training was conducted, and there were extremely significant improvements in strategy and tactics. At the same time, Marshal Tōgō, as president of the Naval War College after the Sino-Japanese War, personally reread the "Sea Warfare Theory" written by Russian General Makarov, adding detailed criticisms and his own opinions. Even on the day of the 527 Battle of Tsushima, there was still a translated book of this work on the chair in the flagship Mikasa's commander's room!</p>
<p>Third, it was the "Naval Spirit" of all soldiers fighting to the last moment for the country. From generals to soldiers, no one did not embrace the fighting spirit of never stopping until victory, and they never considered any concessions other than final victory. They regarded dying on the front line of battle as the greatest glory and sacrificing for the country as the greatest joy in life. The so-called spirit of "each member shattering their bones to complete their mission" was to go forward bravely and never look back. The people in the rear also worked together with the same spirit to cooperate with the battle.</p>
<p>The Japanese "Naval Spirit" wrote the most glorious page in history forty years ago, and today, as the enemy in the Pacific once again approaches the Japanese seas, let us watch what kind of results they will suffer under the Japanese "Naval Spirit." The American aircraft carrier "Franklin," destroyed sixteen nautical miles off the coast of Japan a few days ago, is just the prelude.</p>
<h3>Analysis of Enemy War Intentions – Japanese Fleet in China Press Office</h3>
<p>— Captain Matsumoto</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>After bravely fighting for more than five years, Germany has finally failed and fallen into the tragic fate of unconditional surrender. Today, the European front has sounded the horn of cease-fire. As the Irish Prime Minister stated in his speech on the 20th of this month, "The war has not yet ended. Smaller countries are quietly watching the great powers resolve their internal conflicts. The war is now entering its second stage." But from a military perspective, the war can be said to have shifted to the Pacific.</p>
<p>The current Sino-Japanese war in the Pacific is a decisive battle between Japan and the United States and Britain. Its core is the Ryukyu campaign centered on the Nimitz Pacific Fleet, the Luzon, Mindanao, and Tarakan campaigns based on the McArthur's US Army, and the Pacific war zone led by Marshal Arnold. The US Army Air Force, especially the strategic bomber fleet under Major General Ramey, is conducting bombing raids on Japan and coastal blockade operations, as well as the Southeast Asian operations of Mountbatten's British-Indian Army and the British Indian Ocean Fleet. In addition, the mainland operations of the US 14th Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the modernized Chongqing army can also be included.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The Nimitz counterattack, also known as "Frog Leap Operation," also known as "Island Hopping Operation," and "Stepping Stone Operation," is based on a geometric progression, launching leaping offensives on Makin, Tarawa, Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, etc. Examining its essence, it contains speculative elements and caters to the American public's desire for a quick and decisive battle.</p>
<p>The MacArthur offensive, known as the "Base Advancement Operation," is advancing slowly in arithmetic progression towards the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Biak, Morotai, Leyte, Mindanao, Luzon, Mindanao, the Sulu Islands, Tarakan, etc. Although slow, it is a pragmatic warfare method. Although it disregards American domestic public opinion, it can be said to be a path taken from a completely military perspective.</p>
<p>The US Army Air Force in the Pacific war zone includes the 20th Air Force (B-29 bomber fleet) based in the Mariana Islands, and the 5th and 13th Air Forces based in the Philippines. When the former started bombing Japan last October, the number of attacking aircraft was only thirty to forty, and the frequency was only once or twice a month. Since then, due to the transfer of air force personnel from the Chongqing air base, increased production (the production volume in January this year was 135, and the recent monthly production is 200), and the improvement of the base, it is urgently seeking to bomb Japan and block the Japanese coast. The latter, in addition to preparing the Clark Field base, mainly gathers B-24 bombers to engage in the blockade of the mainland coast and the interruption of navigation. Although the air force of both has suffered heavy losses from the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, it is still necessary to be strictly vigilant about their future strategies.</p>
<p>The Southeast Asian Army under Mountbatten was newly formed as part of the overall counterattack against Japan in the Pacific. In the 18th year of Showa (1943), it encountered the preemptive attack of the Japanese Burma Expeditionary Force, and the Indo-Burma border was immediately lost, causing a sensation in the world and being regarded as a joke. After the summer of the 19th year of Showa (1944), due to the improvement and expansion of the air force and the assistance of the American-style Chongqing army, it gradually turned from defense to offense, and from this year onwards, it actually implemented a southward offensive with the goal of Rangoon. The future trend is the same as the actions of the British Indian Ocean Fleet, and it is necessary to be strictly vigilant.</p>
<p>Finally, the modernization of the Chongqing army's equipment is noteworthy. Although its effectiveness is not as great as its external propaganda, due to the construction of the Stilwell Road and the activity of the air transport unit, it is expected that forty divisions can be prepared by next spring. Once the mainland operations become full-scale, they will exert considerable effectiveness.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The enemy is promoting the movement of European military power to the Pacific and is eager to realize it. However, due to the complex and subtle international political relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, as well as strategic reasons such as insufficient ships and lack of bases, there is a certain limit to the deployment of troops. If the quantity and timing are judged, the impact on the Pacific war situation will not be significant at present.</p>
<p>In terms of naval power alone, most of the British and American fleets had already participated in the Pacific operations before the end of the European war, and only a part of the British fleet remains. In terms of land forces, the United States has 700,000 front-line troops and approximately 3 million rear-echelon troops in Europe, bordering the Soviet Union's 4 million troops along the Elbe River. Due to insufficient ships, it is expected that approximately seven divisions of 120,000 troops can be transferred to the Pacific as front-line troops by October of this year. By April of next year, there may be thirty divisions, totaling 500,000 troops. Therefore, the mobilization of land forces cannot be as large as the enemy advertises for the time being.</p>
<p>Finally, air power can be mobilized relatively quickly. As stated by General Spaatz, commander of the US Air Forces in Europe, although the air force is limited by the lack of bases, it is necessary to mobilize approximately twice the current air force. In particular, considering the enemy's active preparation at the bases in the Philippines and the occupied islands, as well as the possibility of using bases in China, the enhancement of its air power cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>So, under what intentions will the enemy adopt what form of operations in the future?</p>
<p>First, the Nimitz strategy has gradually developed flaws on Okinawa. Due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese special attack corps and air force, most of the enemy's naval units have been annihilated. The Japanese garrison on the island is fighting bravely, and the enemy's 10th Landing Corps has lost more than half of its forces. The war situation is in a stalemate, and the attack is completely blocked. In order to break this deadlock, the enemy may launch a new "forceful enemy suppression" operation. According to the news from the front-line reporters: "The enemy mobile unit has a slight sign of moving north." This may be regarded as a prelude to the new operation. The enemy claims that "in order to break into the Japanese mainland, more bases are needed," and from observing the current status of the enemy's land and sea forces, the enemy's target of attack can be speculated as its so-called "stepping stone to the mainland," that is, small islands that can be used as air bases.</p>
<p>The goals of MacArthur and Weygand are of course in Southeast Asia, which can also be regarded as a "branch operation" for the US and Britain to prepare for a long-term war, accounting for a smaller proportion of the overall war situation.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Nimitz's island-hopping tactics have come to a standstill and developed flaws. MacArthur's previously loudly proclaimed mainland landing operations are also difficult to realize immediately due to the limitations of troops and ships. Currently, the enemy's main operation can be said to be the strategic bombing war. New York Times columnist Hansuld has warned: "The US Army and Navy General Staff also know that Japan cannot be subdued by dangerous means, so a long-term war plan must be established. Even if it is a big gamble on victory or defeat today, it will fail." The words imply criticism of Nimitz's tactics in the bloody battles on Iwo Jima and the fierce fighting on Okinawa in the past. In addition, when Nimitz met with reporters after announcing Germany's surrender, he also stated: "We expect that air force support will come from Europe, but there are not enough airfields in that theater to accommodate this large number of aircraft, so we must make full efforts to accommodate it. (Omission) However, if necessary, we will establish a plan to invade Japan step by step." This proves that he regards the mainland operation as essential, and the prerequisite must be a forced air annihilation war, just as the commander of the Army Air Force, Arnold, stated on March 29: "The United States intends to use all aircraft to broadly destroy Japanese industry so that the East Asian war can end sooner." Also, General Twining, who previously served as the commander of the US Eighth Air Force in Europe and was recently transferred to an important position in the Pacific, stated on May 11: "Our basic strategy is to conduct air strikes to weaken the enemy's strength so that the land forces can occupy the area. We will obtain airfields and air personnel, and establish supply lines and communication bases, and then we can expand the scope of air strikes on Japan." We must be aware of the enemy's intentions in this regard.</p>
<p>In short, the enemy's future intentions are temporarily not mainland landing operations or Japanese mainland landing operations, but strategic bombing and counterattacks in Southeast Asia. This shows that the enemy has changed its plans from a short-term operation to a long-term war. However, because the San Francisco Conference hit a snag, disputes arose over the handling of colonies, and there was no consensus on the handling of Germany. International conflicts such as the struggle for power in Poland, Austria, and Yugoslavia, as well as food panics, urgent needs of the people, lack of manpower, and a strong atmosphere of peace. All these phenomena expose domestic contradictions, so the enemy's long-term war will inevitably have flaws. We should always be patient, resolutely deal with Britain and the United States to the end, and fight bravely and dare to fight to win the final victory.</p>
<h3>Wang Chang Answers Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>Beiping, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: Chairman Wang of the Political Committee met with Chinese and Japanese reporters yesterday. First, Chairman Wang talked about his impression of his inspection of Jinan this time, briefly stating that he believes that going to various places for inspection as usual can allow him to talk with people from various places and learn more about the actual situation of various places for reference. At the same time, many incidents can be resolved locally, so he may go to various places for inspection in the future. Then, various reporters asked questions, and Chairman Wang answered in detail, with the general meaning as follows: Question: What is the significance of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry convening a conference of ambassadors and ministers stationed in China? Answer: Japan's policy towards China still adheres to the established policy of supporting China in completing unification and independence, and establishing friendly Sino-Japanese relations with political equality and economic mutual benefit principles, and overcoming all obstacles. Originally, the principles of political equality and economic mutual benefit are the unchanging policy of the government and the unanimous hope of the people. Japan's policy is like this, and China's hope is also like this. Question: Regarding the public security issues in various places and the issues of the security team and the pacification army, are there any rectification measures? Answer: Of course, special attention should be paid to the public security issue. Originally, the situation in North China and various places is quite complicated, and the troops protecting the pacification areas should be rectified as soon as possible in the future. With good local public security, the work of all other development and increased production will inevitably have good results. Question: What are your valuable opinions on youth and popular political opinions? Answer: My attention to the issue of youth did not start from now, but it has always been the case in the past. It has been expressed in my letter to young people and in other conversations. I will not repeat it here. Secondly, the issue of popular political opinions, the ancients said, "Those who win the people will prosper, and those who lose the people will perish," and I said in my declaration that "There is politics only with the people, and there is no government without the people." This is the traditional Chinese political concept. Even in the era of autocracy and feudalism, attention was paid to the issue of popular opinion, let alone today.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Churchill Resigns Suddenly Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to Reuters report: British Prime Minister Churchill announced his resignation on the 23rd. An official notice issued from 10 Downing Street, London, stated that Prime Minister Churchill resigned after visiting the King of England in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to Reuters report: The King of England met with Churchill on the 23rd. It is generally hoped that after Churchill's visit to the King, the authorities will have an official notice regarding the King's acceptance of Churchill's request to dissolve the parliament, and the notice will be issued within three weeks.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to Reuters political reporter's talk yesterday: If the three-headed conference cannot be convened before the British general election, Prime Minister Churchill may not be able to meet with Truman and Stalin as the representative of the United Kingdom. However, if the Conservative Party can win one day, Churchill will still be able to lead Britain in the war. On the contrary, if the Labour Party wins, they will request the King to appoint Deputy Prime Minister Attlee to reorganize the cabinet. But if the Liberal Party wins, then the leader of the party, the current Minister of Aviation Sinclair, will be responsible for the fate of the entire United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Veto Issue Causes Fierce Debate in San Francisco Conference, Another Difficulty</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from San Francisco: The veto issue that divides the San Francisco Conference into three times is increasingly pressing the greatest crisis on the 22nd. The small and medium-sized countries have launched all their forces and launched a final debate with the five major countries. The experts have made special efforts to explain in order to eliminate the conflict between the opinions of the thousand countries' international charter and the veto power of the major countries. The main points of the dispute are as follows: In addition to being generally recognized, do the five major international powers have the right to implement mediation activities and peaceful resolution measures by means of actual security assurance councils with military means with veto power? Most of the small countries oppose giving the five major countries a wide range of veto power. The key point of this dispute is that the Dumbarton Oaks Case and the Yalta Case did not determine the correct regions where the major countries used veto power. Gadagan, the deputy foreign minister agent of British Chief Representative Foreign Minister Eden, stated last week that the United Kingdom has the right to refuse to discuss and investigate disputes. Although the United States has agreed that the major countries have the right to refuse recommendations and actions, in order to make world opinion support peace and guarantee security, the freedom of discussion and the freedom of investigation are extremely important. Although the Soviet Union and the United States have not formally expressed opposition to this argument, Soviet newspapers have already expressed disagreement. Now the small countries want to know how the five countries' statements will resolve this problem. In the discussion of the international security assurance council, which is commonly used veto power, and which is not commonly used, the major countries quoted a section of the charter to explain in the proposal, but the issue of using veto power was not considered before the establishment of the joint statement of the five major countries.</p>
<h3>Labor Suggestions Opposed by Major Powers</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a Reuters special reporter, the labor proposal requesting the world security assurance agency to be responsible for "promoting all work in the world" was opposed by major countries at the San Francisco Conference. Although the labor proposal was agreed by Modalaham, the leader of the Indian delegation and chairman of the "Economic and Social Association Committee" a few days ago, it aroused great disgust from the US delegation, and they struck at it, briefly saying: "This world security assurance agency is the government between countries. How can it do the work of a country and a family?"</p>
<h3>British and American Forces in Italy Take Military Action, Southern Army Withdraws from Occupied Area Without Resistance</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from Trieste, the British Eighth Army and the US Fifth Army on the Italian front began operations in Venice, a disputed area, on the 22nd, and sent troops to station on the Yugoslav border. According to United Press, the Yugoslav army did not resist when the British and American troops entered. The British and American occupations are very obvious. Just as Tito was about to resolve this dispute, the United States and Britain took military action. The future is quite worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a United Press message from Trieste, the Trieste area dispute is becoming increasingly serious. British and American troops stationed in northeastern Italy have entered the Yugoslav border line. The British Eighth Army, after being reinforced by the US Second Army, has begun to occupy the area from Trieste north to five miles east of Gorizia, and is also penetrating into the disputed Venice-Giulia area. The occupied cities include the Spino Mountains and Taranto. The actions taken by Britain and the United States have shown that they disregard General Tito's recent concessions and want to shatter the hope of peace.</p>
<h3>Local Communications</h3>
<h3>Recent Situation of Anzhen, Wuxi, Vegetarian Delight</h3>
<p>Wuxi is a hub of industry and commerce and is known as Little Shanghai, and Anzhen (a township in Wuxi) is also known as Little Wuxi. Anzhen is also known as "Jiao Mountain" (named after a clay mountain called Jiao Mountain in the west, located northeast of the county seat, adjacent to Dangkou Township). This township is called "An" because most of the residents in the area have the surname An.</p>
<h3>Transportation and Agriculture</h3>
<p>Before the war, Anzhen had long-distance buses on the Xicheng Highway and a combination of wheelbarrows and rickshaws on land, and waterways (canals) had passenger ships towed by gasoline-powered wheels and sailing ships that carried both navigation letters and passengers, traveling to and from the city. It was also very convenient for passengers to take the train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Transportation in Anzhen after the incident was very different. Whether it was long-distance buses or steamships, they were successively suspended due to the lack of gasoline and kerosene. Now, in terms of waterways, what has emerged in its place is charcoal-powered steamships and shuttle-like sailing ships. Anzhen is only a short distance of thirty miles from Xicheng, and the fare also costs several thousand yuan. There is only one postal agency in the post office. This is because navigation letters are more developed than postal letters.</p>
<p>Before the war, every household in Anzhen raised silkworms and planted mulberry trees. The situation has changed. Because the prices of crops such as rice and wheat have risen step by step, they have turned mulberry fields into rice fields. The prosperity of raising silkworms has become a thing of the past. There are also many others who raise pigs, ducks, cattle, sheep, chickens, and fish.</p>
<h3>Commerce and Education</h3>
<p>The stores here are lined up next to each other. There are many cloth stores, foreign general merchandise stores, pharmacies, cigarette stores, and soy sauce workshops, and butcher shops, etc., and there are also many teahouses, restaurants, and dim sum shops, etc., because Anzhen people are the most fond of snacks. The famous and delicious snacks are meat noodles, buns, Tolo biscuits, and magnolia cakes. They sit in the tea dragon and taste and talk after work, or go to the restaurant to relieve their sorrows with wine, happily forgetting their worries. Anzhen Dai Shang calls out friends and gathers people, shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p>There are many private schools in Anzhen. As for the school, there is only Anzhen Elementary School in the town, which is a complete elementary school. Most of the teachers are women, and their teaching is quite serious. There are currently more than 300 students.</p>
<h3>Public Security and Religion</h3>
<p>In terms of public security, there were police sub-bureaus, outposts, and the Anzhen Chamber of Commerce before the war. Since the war, Anzhen has suffered from military disasters, residents have been displaced, and villains have been lurking. Although there are Japanese outposts and police to assist in suppressing them, the area around the Zhen area is still quiet. There are still many bandits in remote villages and alleys. Recently, there is a Tianxian Buddha Association, which has spread widely, claiming that sitting and working deeply can make knives and guns invulnerable, bewitching the ignorant people. One day, the Futang of the Association was destroyed by bandits, and the two sides formed gangs and faced off against each other, killing each other. In the middle of the way, they were killed by bandits, and the situation was very tragic. The Tianxian Buddha Association got the news and mobilized a large number of people to conquer and suppress, so the hometown was frequently alarmed by the crane, and they simply did not dare to step out of the door. The future of Anzhen's public security is really worrying. It is hoped that the police authorities responsible for local public security will quickly replenish the police's strength to protect the lives and property of residents in distress.</p>

<h3>Authorities Actively Planning Measures to Suppress Price Levels Changes to Merchant Evaluation Application Methods Are Coming</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of goods in our city has been manipulated by speculative hoarding merchants, and the rising trend of major commodities has been the most severe, which has a significant impact on people's livelihood and public security. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry is quite concerned about the recent high prices in Shanghai and is planning to actively strengthen the resolute measures to suppress and stabilize prices. The Municipal Economic Bureau is also ordering its subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation of the high prices and urge the Price Review Committee to strengthen the fundamental and effective methods of reviewing prices. It is reported that the bureau will change the method of merchants applying for evaluation in order to achieve the effect of suppressing price levels.</p>
<h3>Strengthen the Implementation of the Guild System</h3>
<p>In order to promote the completion of the wartime economic mission of the various industrial and commercial teams in the city, the Municipal Economic Bureau has actively investigated and completed the strengthening of the organizational structure of the various industry guilds in the city, and then classified them for review, and formulated the strengthening steps to be implemented step by step. It is now reported that the guilds that have been approved for elimination by the bureau recently include: the Old and New Goods Trading Industry Guild, the Clothing and Equipment Purchasing Industry Guild, and the Auction Consignment Industry Guild. The members of the above guilds are similar to the pawnshop business, and their illegal profits are even greater than those of the pawnshop industry, which has a significant impact on the livelihood of ordinary people, so it is necessary to ban them. It has now been ordered to disband immediately, but each member who retains the nature of repurchase should join the pawnshop industry guild, and those who belong to the abandoned repurchase nature should join the second-hand goods industry guild. Members of the auction consignment industry who do not belong to the members of the two industry guilds will be properly handled. As for the other guilds that should be reorganized and merged, they have been determined, and once they have been submitted to the municipal government for approval, they can be carried out separately.</p>
<h3>New Measures Implemented for German, Italian, and Hungarian Officials and Citizens; Municipal Government Has Informed Its Departments</h3>

<p>There will be no changes to public or private property and all rights and interests. The previous measures of detention and control of Italian interests will not be changed.</p>
<p>These measures will be implemented for Germany from May 15th, and for Italy and Hungary from May 16th, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already notified the respective embassies. After receiving the telegram, the Municipal Government has informed all its departments to take note.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Authorities Regulate Lantern Use for Street Vendors</h3>
<p>The Air Defense Authorities of this city, in order to thoroughly strengthen air defense, have implemented graded lighting restrictions starting from the 15th of this month. From dusk to 10 PM, it will be the preparatory lighting restriction, and from 10 PM to dawn the next morning, it will be the alert lighting restriction.

Regarding the issue of open-air vendors, in order to preserve their livelihood, they will be allowed to operate until 10 PM every night, but the lamps they use must comply with the Headquarters' regulations, only using oil lamps with shielded reflectors to direct the light downward. The design has already been prepared and will be distributed to each branch in the coming days, where the Second Section will convene all vendors to observe them as a reference for setting up their own. As for electric lights and carbide lamps, they are not allowed to be used. All operations must cease after 10 PM, and those who violate will be punished.</p>
<p>Air Defense Training Continues to Recruit Trainees</p>
<p>The Citizen Air Defense Headquarters has established an Air Defense Training Institute to cultivate air defense instructors, selecting outstanding police and security personnel from various districts for periodic training. After graduation, they will be assigned to various districts to guide the public in air defense. The fourth class has already started.

These scripts must deeply contain air defense significance. Experts will be hired to evaluate them, and excellent works will be given bonuses. The measures will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Naval Day Speech Meeting Admission Tickets Distributed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, in commemoration of the 40th Naval Day of our ally Japan, will hold a speech meeting and film screening on the 26th and 27th of this month at the Grand Theater and the Grand China Theater. Students from universities and colleges in this city are invited to attend.

<h3>Police Uniforms to be Standardized Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>Since the merger of the former First, Second, and Third Bureaus of the Municipal Police Bureau, it now administers all police affairs in the city. However, the police uniforms worn by the police are different in the former Public Concession, French Concession, and Nanshi and Zhabei areas, and are also not in line with the central government's regulations on police uniforms. Since Mayor Zhou took over as Director, for planning purposes, it has been decided to adjust them and implement them starting next month. Regardless of the police uniforms in the former First and Second Districts, Nanshi, and suburban areas, they will be uniformly changed to the same style starting June 1st to achieve standardization.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Prohibits Schools from Changing School Systems</h3>
<p>Recently, it has been heard that universities and colleges in this city are planning to hold early examinations and divide one academic year into three semesters, which has led to some middle schools also planning to hold graduation examinations early. In order to avoid affecting the overall situation, the Municipal Education Bureau has instructed all middle schools to continue to follow the promulgated school regulations and not to arbitrarily change them. It is also reported that the Ministry of Education has approved this. It is now learned that after receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Education has issued an order to all universities and colleges in Shanghai, prohibiting them from starting vacations early or changing the school system.</p>
<h3>Taxation Methods for Real Estate Transactions</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, according to a report from the Finance Bureau, stated that real estate transactions are taxed at 15 per mille of the business turnover, as stipulated in clear terms. Recently, the Real Estate Trade Association of this city reported that some in the industry act as agents for buying and selling, and the commissions earned are not much. If taxed according to the previous rate, it seems too heavy. The Bureau has proposed that if acting as an agent for buying and selling and earning commissions, the commission amount should be the standard for taxation. If they are engaged in the purchase and sale of real estate for profit, the taxation standard will still be based on business turnover. It is heard that the Municipal Government considers the proposed methods to be appropriate and has instructed the Finance Bureau to follow them.</p>
<h3>Remittances to Shaoxing and Other Places Restored</h3>
<p>The silver industry in this city temporarily suspended remittance business due to a shortage of cash in many areas. It is now learned that various shops and banks in the industry are actively trying to restore remittances to areas where they were suspended to facilitate the business and industrial sector. This has been implemented from today. The areas where remittances have been restored include Shaoxing in eastern Zhejiang (remitted via Hangzhou), Taixian in northern Jiangsu, Shi Ying, Bengbu in Anhui Province, and Taihu. If remittances are actually needed, the amount can not be restricted.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Actively Promotes Wartime Construction Work; Mr. Chen Binhe of the Advisory Committee Speaks</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Binhe of the Municipal Consulting Committee was dispatched to Jiangsu Province the other day to discuss agricultural loans with the Jiangsu provincial authorities. The reporter of the Central News Agency asked about the progress of the discussion, which has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Mr. Chen reported last night on the general situation of Jiangsu Province's construction, as informed by the Jiangsu Provincial Authorities, and a summary is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Under the emphasis of Governor Ren and Director Sun Yingchang, the construction of Jiangsu Province is actively promoting the pre-scheduled plan. The task that Jiangsu Province is taking on for construction is not only undertaking construction projects, but also increasing production work, which is also within the scope of its duties. Governor Ren believes that construction is necessary not only in peacetime, but also in wartime. However, wartime construction should be based on not increasing the suffering of the people as much as possible. The construction work in Jiangsu Province should also focus on being practical and down-to-earth, doing one thing at a time. The construction work currently underway includes the following:</p>
<p>Building Roads</p>
<p>The construction of highway bridges has a construction plan for monitoring the 66 main roads, including the Su-Chang, Su-Jia, Su-Hu, Chang-Tai, Kun-Tai, and Xi-Chang routes. The Su-Hu highway will open a new route, running parallel to the railway line, which is one-third shorter than the original highway. It is suitable for work to begin on the day I went to Jiangsu yesterday, and the entire project will be completed in about two months.</p>
<p>The renovation of the provincial capital's municipal engineering had been planned early, and is now being gradually implemented, such as reorganizing road surfaces and oil ditches, rebuilding bridges, and repairing city walls and parks.</p>
<p>Promote Increased Production Work By Utilizing the Land Along the Sujia Railway to Plant Food Crops Which Is Currently Being Surveyed and Measured and Divided by Planting Areas.</p>
<p>Construct wartime projects, such as building air-raid shelters in the provincial capital and county towns, digging trenches in various county towns and villages, and building earth forts to facilitate self-defense.</p>
<p>Develop West Mountain</p>
<p>The provincial authorities plan to designate the West Dongting Mountain Autonomous Model Area as an autonomous model area after a visiting group from Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors went to inspect the area on-site. The Office of Political Affairs and relevant departments are actively planning it, hoping that Shanghai's charitable organizations, schools, factories, etc. will evacuate there, or operate locally. It is especially hoped that Shanghai's business circles will organize investment groups to invest and develop there. The provincial government will hire senior individuals with high reputation and experience to preside over it.</p>
<p>General financial institutions have an attitude of deliberately delaying the distribution of funds to various agencies, but the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance not only does not delay the distribution of construction, education and various expenses, but also often urges them to be collected.</p>
<p>Finally, Governor Ren expressed his gratification regarding the issue of cooperation between China and Japan. The provincial authorities are extremely cooperative in handling all necessary military actions during wartime, but on the premise of reducing unnecessary suffering for the people. For example, the recent purchase of cotton, with the full cooperation of the provincial government, was very effective, and the people had no complaints. This is a clear proof that China is expressing sincerity in assisting, and Japan is expressing trust, so that the outcome is multiplied.</p>
<h3>Gold Securities Market to Open for Trading at the Beginning of Next Month; 50 Brokers Approved</h3>
<p>The second phase of gold securities of the Central Reserve Bank, which was issued on the 21st of this month, expired yesterday (23rd). On the last day, merchants and civilians went to purchase them as enthusiastically as in the first phase. The Gold Securities Issuance Preparation Committee will convene the second inspection meeting as soon as the Central Reserve Bank delivers the certificate of issue quantity and the gold to be delivered, and the report will still be checked by the monthly committee members Fu Xiao and Zhuang Yunqing. It is learned that the qualifications of 50 gold securities market brokers have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval, and trading will be opened at the beginning of next month. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance will send two supervisors to the venue at that time to monitor the trading.</p>
<h3>Anti-Epidemic Committee Decides to Strengthen Anti-Epidemic Work; More Police Officers Assigned to Force Injections</h3>
<p>The City Anti-Epidemic Committee held its fourth business meeting on the afternoon of the 21st. Those who attended the meeting included General Shibata of the Allied Forces, Tian Dailiangxian, Director of the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Station, Technician Matsu of the Embassy Office, and Chen Zongxian, Director of the Central Epidemic Prevention Office, and more than 20 others. Director Yuan Junchang of the Health Bureau was unable to attend due to illness, and Committee Member Chen Yidao acted as chairman. First, the chairman reported on the recent work of the committee and the number of cholera vaccinations in the first phase of this year, saying that since it began on April 20, a total of 300,000 and 435 people have been vaccinated as of May 21. This number is less than the same period last year. The biggest reason is that too many people avoid vaccination. According to the report of Committee Member Chen, according to cholera epidemic statistics, this year is the year of cholera, and it is difficult to avoid the outbreak. Moreover, due to air defense, people are digging and using well water everywhere, so it is even more difficult to predict whether it will spread. For the sake of the city's safety and to enhance work efficiency, the committee has decided to write to the Allied military authorities and the police bureau to assist the health bureau in carrying out inspections such as vaccination certificates. The committee then discussed and decided on several important cases: One policeman will be requested from the city government for each vaccination team to assist in forced injection, so as to achieve the expected results. Expand epidemic prevention propaganda, so that the people can clearly understand the true meaning of epidemic prevention and reduce the rate of avoidance. The committee, in view of the possibility of cholera outbreak this year, intends to add some isolation hospitals in addition to the existing isolation hospitals, so as to facilitate the accommodation of patients as much as possible in the event of a cholera outbreak.</p>
<h3>Biscuit and Steamed Bread Industry Prohibits Unauthorized Price Increases</h3>
<p>The price of pancakes and fried dough sticks of the Municipal Cake, Steamed Bread, and Fried Food Industry Association was assessed by the Municipal Price Review Council to be 50 yuan per serving. Now, non-members of the association are taking advantage of the pretext of rising costs to increase prices without authorization, and some members of the industry are blindly following suit. The association believes that the amount of flour allocated to its members is not enough, and they should not follow suit. The association has specially notified all members to abide by the original price and not to increase it without authorization, so as to avoid punishment. It is heard that after the notification and advice, several companies have expressed their acceptance and are still selling at the original price.</p>
<h3>Construction Bureau Prohibits Extortion</h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau yesterday reiterated its instructions to the personnel of the vehicle registration offices, strictly prohibiting any extortion behavior in the registration of general vehicles, and requiring them to handle registration procedures quickly to benefit the public.

<h3>Starting with "Save the Children"</h3>
<p>Children are the masters of tomorrow's society. The success or failure of the future society depends on today's children. Therefore, it is unquestionable that people in society attach importance to child-care and care about children's health. However, although society also attaches considerable importance to primary school teachers, who are called "child caregivers," they are always poor and burdened due to the heavy pressure of life.</p>
<p>Children are like newborn plants, and teachers are of course the farmers who are in charge of cultivation. Everyone hopes that newborn plants will grow strong and have a bountiful autumn harvest. Under this goal, in addition to paying attention to whether the climate and land are suitable, how to make the farmers who are cultivating healthy, happy, and diligent in cultivation will be a very important issue. However, considering the current lives of teachers, most of them are groaning in the abyss of hunger, cold, and disease.</p>
<p>Society entrusts primary school teachers with the sacred mission of "cultivating talents for a hundred years," and it must not stand by and watch the difficult situation of teachers. Similarly, a healthy child cannot be produced under the guidance of teachers who are suffering from hunger and hardship. This is undeniable.</p>
<p>Society values and cares about children, which we have no objection to, but we ask society to give the same attention and care to teachers. With excellent teachers, there can be perfect education; with perfect education, healthy children can be produced! (Bo)</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Fellow, Please Show Compassion</h3>
<p>This office received a letter from Mr. Xie, stating that he is experiencing extreme hardship and has no relatives in Shanghai. He intends to return to his hometown in Xing, Jiangxi, but has no travel expenses. He inquired about the walking route. After investigation by this office, it is true, but the journey is long and cannot be walked. It is hoped that people from Jiangxi will indicate the route. If there are fellows returning home, it would be even better to show compassion and take him along. Mr. Xie is willing to take care of all labor and services.
