<h3>峇厘巴板空陸戰日守軍果敢邀擊　士氣旺盛到處予以通創</h3>
<p>南方基地六日中央社電　自敵軍於　厘巴板登陸以來，至四日傍晚止，其兵力已達一萬五千餘名，日軍守　部隊予以果敢之邀　，至是日止，業　敵二名以上，敵方爲援助其陸軍，每日出動戰鬥　炸機等一百五十餘架，轟炸掃射日軍陣地，夜　則加以緩慢之　　射擊，　日軍守　部隊於敵軍此種為列砲擊下，士氣愈益旺盛，到處邀　敵軍，予以痛創。</p>
<p>婆羅作戰地方企圖</p>
<p>昭南六日中央社電敵此次婆羅洲作戰，專事侵攻資源地區，企圖藉婆羅洲油田補充燃料之不足，其作職之步驟及速度，實與冲繩各基地之整頓，與對於日本土作戰之時期及規模息息相關。本年六月以來，美軍用於對日　戰使用之飛機，約計一萬一千架，所消耗之飛機燃料，約達四十二萬　，運輸此項燃料之船舶，復需要約六十萬噸。此外空隊呼應作戰必需之機甲部隊，其所需燃料補給量，更極龐大，他如僅於最近四閱月問，海上作戰所需之燃料，即　一百五十萬噸，此項龐大數量之燃　，完全仰　於美本國及中東之補給，費時耗力，莫此爲甚。婆羅洲之油田產量，最多可供給所需總量之十成，然因距　關係。藉此可節省一部船舶，故乃發動此次作戰，以較由美本國或中東方面輸送燃料，此次另由婆羅洲供給，於航運上可增加數倍效力，故婆羅洲於敵燃料資源之補給戰意　甚大。</p>
<h3>日軍在香港　布堅固陣地</h3>

<h3>渝方民衆和平聲浪</h3>

<h3>日篠田中將等四將士陣亡</h3>
<p>佐世保鎮守府昨發表</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電佐世保鎮守府六日公布業已戰死之日本四將士名單，中將　田勝淸，少將野口伍三郎，少將橋本卯六，少將山內堤象。目然難免中國士地荒廢，設施破壞，使中國復興不能進展。　　外力而進行對日抗戰時，則戰後中國主權之完　　實無保障，凡軍政，經濟。文化各部門，均有彼外國勢力蠶食之處。　美軍在極端尊重婦女之英國，尚且放肆已極，如經侵入中國大陸，將混亂中國民族之純潔血統，尤其呼號保持民族純潔血統之智識靑年份子，要求美軍立即撤退。又徽諸自鴉片戰役以來，歷百年間之中國近代史，感情的對日作戰，反使中國走入滅亡之途，此稱見解亦相富有力。最近之渝方廣播，即雲遊此種空氣，謂「目前日軍尚抱有數百萬之精兵，雖云野遭一部損失，而仍抱有相當之海軍兵力，足以應付今後之戰鬥云。然而此種現象，並不使首都重　一地如是，據傳湖南廣西方面前綫渝軍內部，亦有此種論調發生</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>重慶對蘇外交的分析</h3>
<p>我們會經分析過宋子文訪蘇的使命，　爲不外下列三點：　改善渝蘇關係，　　停渝共關係，　會商對日決戰問題。現在更就重慶對蘇外交分析如下：</p>
<p>淪蘇關係改善雖屬可能，而所要的代價一定不小。不久，重慶的六全大會中，一方面議決促進對蘇外交，他方面又發表了否認外蒙共和國獨立的宣言。顯然，這中間有着不可避免的矛盾。而事實也可以證明，宋子文的外交已經在莫斯科碰到了暗礁。宋子文到莫斯科沒有幾天，外蒙共和國的總理也接踵而至。根據一九二四年的中蘇條約，外蒙是中國的保誕領土，依照重慶六全大會的決議，外蒙獨立應該否認，可是假如史太林以外蒙或新疆的問題爲交換條件時，渝蘇關係的改善，幷非易事。</p>
<p>渝共開係是否可以利用國際勢力來解决？美國在調停渝共關係上可以說是完全失敗了，要壓迫重慶緩和對於共黨的關係，而引起了重慶强硬的反抗，史蒂威爾事件就是一個例子；要聯合重慶勢力來壓制共黨，而結果哈萊路綫也成爲共黨惡聲相向的目標。因此，美國想起由重慶來懇求蘇聯出來調停的一着。在重慶，也似乎除向莫斯科談判外，別無他法。可是蘇聯雖在近年未對共黨有實際援助，但畢竟是同情共黨的。假如蘇聯提出組織聯合政府，爲渝共調停的基本方案時，宋子文又何必有莫斯科之行。</p>
<p>渝方與美英都希望對日次戰能在最近期內結束，因爲戰局愈是延長，愈是不利，所以要求蘇聯也來參加對日戰爭，這問題，美國已經做了不少利誘的工作，這次三頭會議或者也要談到。宋子文的使命中可以說有着重慶和美國雙方的意思。可是蘇聯在對德作戰結束後，喘息未定，現在最需要的却是休養生息，同時重慶和美英對日作戰的長期化，正是蘇聯養精蓄銳的好機會。</p>
<h3>新協滬分會昨舉行時事報導懇談會　桑原部長出席指導</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會，於昨日（六日）下午四時假目華俱樂部舉行第四次時事懇會，　請盟邦桑原海軍報道部長出席指導，到有桑原部長，松本大尉，宇崎　托等，暨本市各報　陳彬無。陳日平。魯風。楊光政等二十餘人，懇談要旨如左》</p>
<p>（問）沖繩島大戰後的戰局動向如何？</p>
<p>（答）沖繩島戰事，以吾軍特工部隊之勇猛攻擊，使敵軍受損極巨，現雖告一結束，而敵軍於受創之餘，當未能即行繼續大規　之作戰。現日美兩方，可謂均在積極準備中。日本為防衛本土作戰，重要地點皆成要塞。</p>
<p>在美國方而，從五月起已開始將歐洲的軍隊移動，除一部份調回本國外　一部分直接調至太平洋作戰，可是此種準備，必需相當期間。可以詞到者，只是航空部隊而巳。因此，最近日木本土或中國大陸的空製，也許要比過去頻繁。同時地上部隊在逐漸集中於菲列賓，惟將來大規模作戰，必須與英軍渝軍配合，故準備時間較長，眞正大規模的決戰，預料將在明年春天方才開始。</p>
<p>今後敵軍飛機之行動或將比較積極，但敵方宜傳把握制空制海之種，完全不確，　如「康脫凡第」曾經進過水，速度旣慢，目標又大，已從上海安全的到達日本，現在日本從事運輸工作，便是一個反證，其他船舶，仍舊來往不絕。</p>
<p>（問）南太平洋婆羅洲敵軍新攻勢之發展前途如何？</p>
<p>（答）敵方對泰拉干。婆羅洲。峇厘巴板開始攻勢。其意義，一方面因為補給綫太畏，要獲得接近日本的煤油根據地，他方而在　斷日本與南洋之問的聯絡。可是這是戰局長期化的徵象。敵軍在琉黃島。沖繩島等小島化了極大的代價，而在婆羅洲的大島從事作戰，損害富更慘重。幷日美軍與英俊互相呼應，或許在馬來。昭南。爪哇。　門答應等處，將來也要發生新的戰事。</p>
<p>（問）宋子文赴蘇　動請加剖祈？</p>
<p>（答）在舊金山會　開會時，就有宋子文訪蘇的傳說，但其後宋子文由舊金山送　重慶後，再往莫斯科，其間當然有預定計劃，幷且聽受蔣介石的指示。現在宋子文與史太林已經會見，討論的問題，大概不外　國共問題，　戰後的極東問兩方面。前者因爲聯合軍在大陸登陸作戰時，必須與延安軍接觸，所以事先不能不有所聯絡。據外人評論，聯合軍在大陸登陸時，必定與延安軍發生種種糾紛，這一點上相當有理的。至於後者蘇聯對於德戰爭終了後，正在擬養生息，不致貿然受人慫恿，就是蘇聯答應朱子文調停延安問題，一定會提出積大的要求，譬如新疆省，或是外蒙古問題。</p>
<p>（問）三頭會議與大東亞戰局的關係如何？（答）三頭會議所討論的問題，大概不外三者：　歐洲處理問題之最終決定。　舊金山會議討論不適　的有關弱小國家的問題。　對日問題。我們在道三者之問，只有對日問題最爲關心。美國屢次拉攏蘇聯參加，其主要原因還是藉以縮　戰爭，避免長期戰的困苦。至於蘇聯的態度究竟如何，現在中立條約雖然通知廢　，可是和日本還繼續友好的關係，並且蘇聯於久戰之餘，再無驅使國民從事戰爭的意思。</p>
<h3>日地方軍需官　舉行聯合會　檢討增強生產各問題</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電日地方軍需管理局長官聯合會，四。五兩日在軍需省舉行，第一日由幾田軍需相致訓辭後，由各長官報告各該管地方之情况，軍需省顧問及統制會會長舉行懇談，最後說明總動員整備，管理等三局之關係。第二日爲航空兵器總局暨其他各局舉行連絡會議，例如中央事務之移讓與地方，地方物資動員計劃，促進　施工塲之緊急疏散，硫立防衛生產體制，生產防衛對策，設置地方本部建設部，緊急增加航空燃料產量，以及其他電力，航空兵器關係各事項，就增强軍需生產各問題，加以檢討。</p>
<p>動員學生開墾山林</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日政府爲確保本士決戰時之食糧資源，乃大規模動員全國學生，積極開懇採伐後之平地林與高原地帶，四日業由農商省農政兩局長並文部省總務局長等，連名向各地方長官發出公文，令依照本年三月次會談決定動員農業學校學生，各農村國民學校高等科學生，中等學生或一部份大學高等學生，結成援農部隊，全年服務。該動員學生等，即從事開墾山林，開墾總面積為十萬頃，今後復隨時逐漸推廣，可望於九月前完成項計劃。</p>
<p>鮮設大陸生產會議</p>
<p>京城六日中央社電爲與大陸連絡會議相呼應，且迅速實現該會議之協議事項，藉以迅速發揮大陸最高之綜合戰力，此次決設立民間協力連絡機關之大陸生產會議，朝鮮電業外各部們代表，滿洲國方面有滿洲重工業代表，其他華北，蒙　關係者，齊集於一堂，舉行設立協議會，該會之下，設置鑛工業部門會議，其中之大陸鋼鐵生產推推進會議，近於新京舉行第一次會　，順虛亦組機輕金屬及其他各部門之會議。</p>

<h3>澳繼任首相人選未決定</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電據雪梨訊：自澳洲首相寇丁逝世後，首相一席之繼任人尚未決定。目下有三人有繼任自相之可能，　福特，渠爲陸軍部長，日於寇丁臥病時，會代理首相之職務，　現任財長基夫萊，　外長伊凡特，渠曾領導澳外交代表團出席舊金山會議。然關於商討新首相之委任事宜，將待全國總督格魯塞期特公爵自新幾內亞返國後始能決定。</p>

<p>周副院長親撰祭文</p>
<p>維中華民國三十四年七月六日，不孝男佛海泣奠於顯妣周母馬太夫人之靈位前日：嗚呼！太夫人以六月二十五日壽終貴陽，越六日移靈，暫曆於紅芳地，茲於成主之後，敬修家奠之儀，距太夫人之辭世，蓋十有二日矣。溯先考之歿，於今三十有六載，此三十六載中，失　之孤兒，緊維慈母之愛，以作心靈之主宰，以爲立身行已之準繩，今而後」不孝乃永爲無父無母之人矣。天乎痛哉！憶昔兒時，圍繞太夫人之膝下者，惟男及一弟一妹，我先考　　閩海，淸風兩袖，不得行其志以歿。太夫人刻苦自　，不以家計之　，對　族　黨，唯恐不能盡禮，對不孝等　之育之，唯恐有失，若者未竹馬　遊之　，若者爲色笑常親之所，永　心版，歷歷在目前。不孝將五十，人海浮沉，官途出入，所至人　　　，自新得住太夫人精神感召者十多，亦不孝所畢生受用不盡者也。嗚呼，太夫人之　不孝笑而　然長逝，夢　邪，　可告預？民元至歲。不孝以名列前茅，考入縣立高等小學，太夫人聞之而喜及。　年不孝以歐文校規自首，仍不得請，份兒負　長沙，太夫人於痛切誥　之餘，厚給資斧，　不孝終得稍申其治。繼而不孝復返縣城，以　　師之提緊，得人縣立中學，程門立雪，　水承　，一生最幸福愉快之時，實在於斯，不孝之發奮讀書，①始於此。民六之下，不孝以師友之助，忽將東渡留學，太夫人激於望子成名之淑珍，勉一其留依膝下之情　，終於治裝，俾得或行。拜別之日，太夫人暗泣于廚下，鳴呼從此不孝爲求學爲報國，南北東西，遂不能久依膝下，長缺定省之職，終興風木之悲，彼蒼之厄人，固如是其酷也。民七以時事關係，留東學生，粉　　國，不孝愛國出於天性，乃區東京二至安東，求助於同鄉，及至安東，無可容身，　　價國，前路茫茫。斯時業，學尚未成，而一直縱身入海，以經其，以慈母之艾，更厲其上進之勇氣，遂　在返東京，由一高而七高，而京都帝大，幸得完其學業，迄愈成立。使無慈母夢中之昭示，不孝能有今日耶？不孝隨同故主席任公，今代主席陳公，矢志和平遝動，亦旣八年，不孝　子三民主義建國之大義，深知黨不可分，國必統一，徒以和戰之異同，致有吳蜀之參商，烽火迎天，民生滋困，如何出斯民于水火，而登之袵席，收焦土之燼餘，而重建邦家，程功實艱，用心尤苦，不孝以藐藐之躬，肩艱鉅之任，遇困厄則不能不呼父母，今而後雖淪地呼天，太夫人將不我　也。嗚呼慟矣！自民六離家以後，不孝足跡未得再履家園，每思歸省，而常有意外之阻，兼以軍事或政治關係，家報亦未能常通美，太夫人盼望不孝功業之成就，懸心不孝個人之安危，悲歡驚懼，何可言宜。此卅年中，兩度迎養　目都，太夫人淡泊自甘，燕居自適，往往因懷念故土，而遄返家園。自廿五年，首都送別之後，廿六年戰事旣起，其冬返湘，亟思省親，以聞德使調停之訊，而急回漢上，遂不及一承太夫人之色　。　七年雖汪故主席乘飛機自昆明往河內之幾，登幾第一幻念，意者今後不及再見吾母，又熟知今日孩子幻之果為百也。　年以來，數度派人回湘，亟思迎養太夫人于京滬，太夫人年老憚于遠行，欲行又止勞屢，遂有黔中之行，終于歿于思鄕，使不孝之弟佛生今猶健在者，太夫人　　之際，庶幾湯　得以親嘗，殯殮得以親恃，不致使不孝之妹佛珍獨任其勞，劬勞之恩莫報，人子之心差安。又孰知佛生之歿去，今日十有六載矣。方興　　少悲，重念　簾之痛，嗚呼　哉　孫男幼海　已成年，組知文史，孫女書海，已適　氏，孫女　海，已字吳家，彼等必能念　而指自分，此則　　　於太夫人之靈氣者。不孝優患餘生，疾病親訊，惟有驚其畢生之精神，　力于民族國家與廠之大業，其所以光先德二　　親于泉下者，唯此而已。嗚呼，　　西望，　運蹲苗，　　碗在，色笑難成，吳天　極。哀痛和　，伏　　平重　之日，恭上　　表幕之文。嗚呼哀哉，伏唯尚響。</p>

<h3>緬甸東部日軍　防衛綫强化</h3>
<p>自從敵軍侵人瓦城以來，在兩個月之間，緬甸戰局已全面的顯出很大的轉變。至於轉變的關鍵，就是二月中旬渡過白來克南方的尼揚河，又在同月二十七日，向　緬甸平原的中心梅克狄拉猛進的敵方有力機動部隊的行動。該地爲日軍蜿蜒百公里以上的伊拉瓦底邀擊陣綫的要點，敵軍進犯該處，實爲冒險的舉動，因此於三月初旬，經日軍述續猛反攻之後，敵航空部隊軍幾瀕殲滅的危境，敵方除動員他方面航空兵力掩護梅克狄拉的飛行部隊以外，並企圖在伊拉瓦底江各渡河點强行渡河。最後，因瓦城日軍自動退出，敵軍即在飛機掩護下，以戰車為先　，侵入撒加因西方約四十公里的加人，繼續進犯其西二十公里的密哈等地。中部緬甸平原的戰局，至此遂呈頗難逆料的狀態</p>
<p>此外，與伊拉瓦底決戰呼應，渝新編第三十師。三十八師及英印軍第八十師與三十六師，亦岡南下　部。這一路兵，和盤谷南方伊拉瓦底江西岸的東菲第十一師，以阿恩爲中心的海岸方面英印第二十五師，及拉姆　島與通軋普正面的英印第二十六師，合計起來，兵力相當龐大。</p>
<p>奪回挖成，是敵軍四年來的夙願，現旣如願以償，他們將進一步希望，奪回仰光，實屬意中事。即迄四月中旬止，伊拉瓦底江沿岸的敵軍陳容整頓完學以後，就以梅克狄拉的機械化部隊爲先鋒，開始南下，雖受日軍猛攻，損失極大，仍逐漸循瓦城大路南進，經耶梅森，於同月十九日進抵賓瑪拿。是時，雨季迫近眉睫，而汀朗附近，又因丘陵橫阻東西，地勢殊險。敵軍於雨季來臨以前若不衝過這個險要之處，即難進窺仰光。因此，急忙改變戰法，避開日軍反攻的先鋒，利用富於機動力的戰車，分兩路進兵，沿瓦城大道左右兩方，向南疾進，至廿二日，其戰車部隊即已進抵通古南方的比由附近。至此，敵軍航空兵力再度大舉進攻，掩誕向仰光南進的機械化部隊，同時以降洛傘部隊及印度洋艦隊的一部，開始總攻擊，及至五月四日，據其電台廣播，已有一部分軍隊攻入仰光市。但在此以前。雙方會在北古附近展開血戰，日軍精銳並於仰光周圍使敵軍大流其血。而且。敵軍的南下，因太匆忙，所以自北方起，經塔齊。賓　拿。通古的瓦城大道東西沿綫一帶，敵軍後方，不　受到從伊拉瓦底江南岸轉進的日軍猛烈製擊，就是侵入仰光的野心得以實現，可是的確如日軍使敵軍大量出血的原有計　，敵軍損失著實不小。</p>
<p>從此觀點看，緬甸戰線與馬來。泰國。菲律賓。華南各地，有密切的關係，在粉碎從陸地侵使攻束亞的敵軍企岡上，實有重大的使命。今日，日軍確保西丹。薩爾溫兩河的天然防禦綫，邀擊敵軍，定能予以重大打擊。（石母田。吉田兩特派員）（譯自朝日新聞）</p>

<p>市府前　產管理委員會，已於本年二月底奉令裁撤，其業務歸併財政局辦理，該局經着手整頓不還餘力。凡被管理之渝產如市民能提出出產權確證，請求解除管理者，一經該局密核屬實，均可准予發還。茲悉最近有市民梅頌先呈請發　南市書錦路　錦坊二號，　筱嚴呈請發　南市竹行碼頭二二一號，　　標呈請發　虹橋路二二五號及愚　路一○五五號，　葛氏呈請發　　川路二三號，黃增馥呈請發還障川路二九三三號，許秋經請發還方斜路十六號等各房產，經財局先後查核無誤，分別批准解除渝產管理，並呈報市府</p>

<h3>觀舞踴名劇「鐘樓怪人」</h3>
<p>— 羔雁</p>
<p>上海音樂協會主辦之浪漫舞踊名劇「鐘樓怪人」，已於本星期四起在　心戲院公演，日夜共演入塲，至下星期一即九日爲止。在本屆音樂季中，這是末一次的舞劇演出，愛好舞踊劇　者均於道個　欣的機會倒不可錯過呢。</p>
<p>「樓怪人」——即「巴黎聖母院』，是法國士九世紀浪漫派巨舉，大時人　　的不朽之作。關於這個敘　體數文巨著的故事，　　他的另一傑作「孤星淚」一樣，久已爲愛好文　者所推崇。即以本埠的戲觀衆來　，過去默片時代之郎却乃，和聲片中之却爾斯勞頓都曾爲本劇主角。駝背醜人瓜西木多的印象，大概還深印在許多人的腦蒂中罷。至於話劇，演出成　也不差，這里不　了。</p>
<p>這次蘭心的「鐘樓怪人」，係純粹的舞踊劇——Ballet，由舞蹈音樂以及表情交織而成的啞劇。沒有劇詞，不開歌唱，是其特徵。演員由海上俄國舞踊劇團團員擔任，上海交響樂團遠走音樂，以一個動人的文學巨著，由熟練的舞蹈專家和完美的音樂團來合作表演，其在藝術上的成就，自可叫人滿意。</p>
<p>全劇三募四景，配搭　　，無懈可擊。第一幕駝背瓜西木多出塲，羣丐舉行愚人節的慶祝。吉卜西琉浪女子哀絲獎　姐，和衛隊長服部氏一見鍾情，全劇的幾個重要角色都次第出現。第二幕為本劇舞蹈節目的精華所在，主角哀絲美（波碧妮娜飾）及男主角謝　魯金（飾衛隊長）於舞藝均有深造，力量申請和每的表現，已屆爐火純青之候，博得台下不斷的掌聲。</p>
<p>第三幕在故事上說是全劇的頂點，當　絲美拉妲被掛在絞架上，教士富老羅被瓜西木多從　　　下，在地上，　俄的筆下怎　描寫這個醜人——好像一個巨人被宰割後，永遠　不整齊起來的那樣　—的心理，是如何的動火。他嘴裡嘟囔者，「啊呀，他們都是我所愛的呀！」當然這舞　啞劇並未如是表演，駝背也不會開口，不過利用了音樂武藝，在觀眾的心絃上巳激起了這個波奏。</p>
<p>本劇佈景綺麗，服　華美，都　上乘。指導草　義人，演出及舞　主任　關而司基（劇中扮敎士富老羅），以及音樂指　司　次基　君於本劇的成功，　獻最多。</p>

<h3>决勝階段之　日海軍諸統帥</h3>
<p>當戰爭步入決勝階段之際，日本海軍最高統帥部入選，再行充實，完成日海軍建軍以來最堅强的　般陣容。據日本海軍省五月二十九日公布，原軍令部總長及川古志郞大將榮　軍事參議官，其後任由海軍總司令長官兼聯合艦隊司令長官兼海上護衛司令長官豐田副武大將繼任，而海軍總司令長官兼聯合艦隊司令長官，海上護衛司令長官遺缺，則由軍令部次長小澤治三郞中將繼任，負責指揮全部海軍第一綫兵力。又，軍令部次長遺缺則由非島方面海軍基地航空部隊指揮官大西瀧治郞中將繼任。按日海軍總司令長官兼聯合艦隊司令長官豐田大將，長期活躍海上，此次就任軍令部總長，以其前綫貴重的經騐，活用於軍令方面，對於本土決戰戰局，定有極大貢獻。新海軍總司令長官小澤治三郞中將，新軍令部次長大西瀧治郞中將，皆為航空關係權威者，而大西部次長大西瀧治郞中將，皆為航空關係權威者，而大西中將曾於合灣海面，菲島海面海空戰術樹立偉勳。今日航空戰鬥愈趨激烈，以富於前綫經騐的航空戰權威授以要職，極為適當，而且由此可知日海軍突破難局的決意。茲將榮任新職的各將領履歷，略述如後。</p>
<p>豐田大將　軍政軍略奇才</p>
<p>新軍令部總長豐田副武大將，和軍　廣瀕中佐同鄉，原籍大分縣，明治三十八年（一九〇五年）海軍兵學校卒業，四十年（一九〇七年）入砲述學校，海軍大學，繼續深造。第一次世界大戰時，出征於靑島，西伯利亞方面。大正十三年（一九二四年）由　　艦長轉任軍務局員，十四年（一九二五年）晋級大佐。昭和二年（一九二七年）任第七　水隊司令，教練奇　戰術。旋任敎育局第一課長，專心於軍政方面。五年（一九三〇年）任日向艦長，翌年十二月昇少將，任軍令部第二部長。八年（一九三三年）九月，任聯合艦隊參謀長兼第一艦隊參謀長。十年（一九三五年）三月轉任敎育局長，同年十一月晋升中將，是時於米內海相及山本次官之下任軍務局長，經二·二六事件及中日事變，巧妙發揮收拾內外危局的手腕，當時頗得好評。</p>
<p>旋於十二月十日就任華北方面海軍最高指揮官，兵不血刃，在靑島上陸，其後又於杭州灣登陸時樹立極大武勳。十三年（一九三八年）十一月歸國，未暇席暖，即起任第二艦隊司令長官。次年十月，歸任艦政本部長要職。十六年（一九四一年）九月，榮晋大將，任吳鎭長官。在職二年，致力於自主的軍備計畫之實現，功績頗大。十七年（一九四二年）十一月，任軍事參議官。翌年五月任橫須賀鎭守府長官。去歲三月，繼古賀元帥之後，就任聯合艦隊司令長官。本年四月，海軍總隊司令部成立，即任海軍總司令長官兼聯合艦隊司令長官，海上護衛司令長官，迄至最近。</p>
<p>及川大將　海軍元老之一</p>
<p>及川大將原籍　岡，明治三十六年（一九〇三年）十二月海軍兵學校畢業，至昭和十四年（一九三九年），累陞為海軍大將，其間歷任吳鎭參謀長，軍令部第一部長，第一航空戰隊司令官，兵學校長等要職。昭和十年（一九三五年）十一月，就任第三艦隊司令長官，翌年十二月轉任航空本部長。中日事變勃發以來，一直為海軍航空隊的總管，勵精圖治，周祥擘劃。十三年（一九三八年）四月，繼長谷川提督之　，任中國方面艦隊司令長官。十五年（一九四〇年）五月，任橫　長官。同年九月，出任第二次近衛內閣海相。翌年十月，榮轉軍事參議官。十七年（一九四二年）四月，拜靖國神社臨時大祭委員長。十八年（一九四三年）十一月，就首任海上　衛司令長官之職。至去歲八月，繼島田大將之後，任軍令部總長要職，迄至最近。及川大將，在塞　失陷後的重大戰局中，極孚部內的　望，而担任軍令部總長。其間，對於敵方猛烈的反攻作戰，頗能發揮統帥的妙諦，予敵重大的損害，　功甚偉。</p>
<p>小澤中將　航空艦隊名將</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭揭幕以來，航空兵力成為決戰的主力。在立體化的海上作戰中，海軍的主力，即為以航空母艦為基幹的機動艦隊，及與基地航空兵力配合起來的「航空母艦」。關於這支新的航空艦隊之作戰，小澤中將最負盛譽，日本海軍界中，可說無出其右者。小澤中將，自大東亞戰爭勃發以來，迄至去年十一月轉任軍令部次長止，一直在洋上第一綫指揮　艟，不愧是身經百戰的名將。在濟濟多士的日本海軍將領中，夙被譽為良才之一，極孚衆望。回顧其兵學校畢業以來所經的過程，可知他不是担當海上第一綫的指揮官，即任作戰中樞的要職。</p>
<p>小澤中將原籍宮崎縣，明治四十二年（一九〇九年）兵學校卒業，和井上成美大將及小松輝久，草鹿任一，大川內傳各中將同斯畢業。大正十年（一九二一年）晋　少佐，任第一水雷戰隊參謀。至昭和四年（一九二九年），出任軍令部，翌年奉派前往歐美，旋即晋級大佐，任驅逐隊司令。六年（一九三一年）任海軍大學敎官，其後歷任陸軍大學校兵學敎官（一九三二年），摩耶艦長（一九三四年），榛名艦長（一九三五年），海軍大學校敎務長（一九三六年，是年並晋級少將），聯合艦隊參謀長兼第一艦隊參謀長，戰隊司令官（一九三七年），十三年（一九三八年）任海軍水雷學校長，其後復轉任戰隊司令官等職，至十五年（一九四〇年）晋級中將，翌年九月榮任海軍大學校長。大東亞戰爭開始，即自十七年（一九四二年）一月起，出任司令長官，活躍於海上第一綫，在多次海戰中樹立不朽的偉勳。去年十一月菲島海面海空戰後，調回中央，任軍令部次長要職，直至最近。</p>
<p>大西中將　神風勇士保姆</p>
<p>大西中將繼撫育日本海軍航空勢力的故山本元帥之後，指揮空軍作戰，曾經建下許多赫赫的功力。而且，他還是神風特別攻擊隊勇士的偉大「保姆」。</p>
<p>「與　人事生　，我更願意効命　塲。」大西中將曾熱誠地說過這樣的話。因此，去年十月正，當台灣海面航空戰方酣之際，終於由軍需省航空兵器總務局長調出國外，榮任菲島方面海軍航空部隊最高指揮官。自此以後，菲島海面海戰及雷伊泰島作戰，相繼展開，而大西中將也在日美激烈的空戰中，毅然統率神風特別攻擊隊，站在最前線，奮勇鬥爭。中將的功績，可說已在日本航空　史上　一新紀元。</p>
<p>大西中將原籍兵　　，　　四十四年（一九一一年）海軍兵學校畢業，大正十三年（一九二四年）升少佐，隔一年，任佐世保海軍航空隊飛行長。昭和三年（一九二八年）任　翔飛行長，四年（一九二九年）調航本敎育部部員，晋級中佐。六年（一九三一年）任敎育局局員，七年榮轉第三艦隊參謀，八年任佐世保航空隊司令，並升大佐。九年任橫須圓航空隊副隊長兼敎務長。十一年（一九三六年）任航本敎育部長。十四年（一九三九年）以後，榮升少將，歷任航空隊司令官，艦隊參謀長，十七年（一九四二年）轉任航本總務部長，十八年五月晋級中將，十一月任軍需省航空兵器總務局長，至去年十月間，遂出任菲島方面海軍航空部隊　隊指揮官，直到這次繼任軍令部次長時止。</p>
<p>觀其經歷，可知大正四年（一群落　一五年）以來，其職務一直與航空有關，在敎育日本海軍航空部隊健兒一事上，煞費苦心。今日，日本海軍正一新舊觀，　其全力，完成精强的航空艦隊。在這時候，將大西中將這樣富於實際作戰經騐的勇將迎歸中樞，担當軍令部要職，定可適應今後日趨激烈的航空決戰形勢，益使日本軍固如磐石。（譯自五月三十日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>建設平民村芻議</h3>
<p>— 馬惠農</p>
<p>三十一年十月底金家巷棚戶區大火，燒燬四百餘間，罹難災民二千四百餘人，本年五月十一日餘姚路棚戶區大火，燒燬三千餘間，延及工廠十餘家，衖堂二條，罹難災民四千餘人，綜觀二次大火災情，物力與人力之損失，於茲時艱物艱之時，不但有耗國力，即於平民生計，其遭遇之痛苦，實非我人所能想像，究此二次大火之原因，如棚戶建築之簡陋，沒有消防設備及消防組織，社會對於棚戶貧民之忽視，類此種種，若偶而失愼，火熖熾烈之時，確難撲滅，金家巷災區，早由佛敎機關建築平民村，此次餘姚　災區，　亦由該機關積極　建平民村，然環顧大火之慘痛敎訓，我人不但應咎旣往，且宜戒於未患，今餘姚路平民村興建伊始，筆者瀝陳管見，聊供富局及熱心公益者之參考。</p>
<p>本市平民之數量甚為衆多，而住居曹家渡徐家滙虹口閘北南市等地方之赤貧棚戶，其數亦夥，這般赤貧棚戶，日以苦力，拉車，小販為生計，他們担負最艱苦的生產工作，他們為着都市的建設和繁華盡了很多力量，他們的生活雖然像牛馬，但他們是都市的中　力量，他們是都市的功臣，在戰前，市政當局曾為這般棚戶的住房而加改進，在中山路等地，　築了幾百間平民村，但是，由於平民—或貧民的衆多，所以沒有普遍的獲得居住，因此各處棚戶仍然觸目皆是，今餘姚路　民村雖巳興工建築，但是為了他　的生活和幸福，我們不應以簡接的救濟或　變所住房而　了事，因為，除了住的問題之外，如敎育，文化，淸潔衛生，醫藥，消防，娛樂等等，都應給以適當的改善。</p>
<p>敎育方面：棚戶區的貧民及兒童，大都是文　，為了國家的復興和普及敎育計，筆者希望熱心義務敎育的人士，在那地創辦義務小學及識字敎育，使那地的貧民兒童都能得到識字的機會，至於授課的時間，可以利用他們業餘的時間。</p>
<p>文化方面：該區人口衆多，我們不但應灌輸相當的知識；並且應設立一個民衆閱報室和一個圖書室，同時可由熱心人士，經常至該區舉行通俗的知識演講，如醫藥衛生及保甲自警等，在在都能使他們得到長進。</p>
<p>淸潔和衛生方面：貧民對於淸潔和衛生向不注意，如傾倒垃圾，隨地便溺，閉塞溝道，室內垢物雜陳，因此，蚊蠅叢生，關於這，希望當局多設垃圾箱，設立公厠，同時並進行淸潔衛生之指導，務使貧民注意公共衛生，必要時，應實施淸潔檢查。</p>
<p>醫藥方面：貧民因忽視衛生而病者，或病後無力就醫者，為數甚多，尤以貧民愚昧無知，因此，一旦罹病，或故意延宕時間以求痊　，或求神間卜以免災患，類此現象，實宜注意，故有望於本市各慈善機關，多多在該區辦理施診給藥及平民診療所，儘量減低收費，使病者皆得診療，衛生富局則應經常至該區注射防疫針及種痘，　使他們免除疫癘或傳染。</p>
<p>公共活動方面：在貧民住居的地方，因為人口衆多，所以他們生活上的活動也是應該注意的。　如婚喪等事，他們亦須設筵祝　，尤以每逢喪事，須有適當的地方供給他們，因此，在平民村的同，和百間房子裏，抽出五六間房子來作為公共禮堂，專為預備他們婚喪之用。　平常時候，可以利用這　房子，　一　最簡便的娛樂器具如象棋或供給留　機或播音機之類的東西，讓他們得到適當的調劑，此外，儘　利用一些空隙　地，種種花草　木，甚至　　一個小型運動塲地，使他們得到運動的機會。</p>
<p>消防方面：宜多　水井，並抽調壯丁實施消防訓練及組織消防隊，可能時，請當局略備滅火機及水龍，以備未患。</p>
<p>關於上述諸點，希望當局擇尤採行，切實為貧民的生活而設法改善，而各慈善機關及熱心公益之名流，亦可協助該保甲機關，俾多嘉惠於貧民。最後，應富在這地劃出幾間房子作為公共之用，旣可假以敎育又可作為禮堂甚或給藥施診之用。另一方面，負責保甲工作之人員，不但應當經常注意到平民村的管理工作，同時還宜切實對他們生活上多多指導。</p>
<p>我們不應給他們解決了住的問題就算了事，而應當想法建設一個完美的平民村。（移酬義學金）</p>
<h3>强化夏令衛生行政</h3>
<p>— 李仁衆</p>
<p>最近幾天，市民的死亡數漸見加多；當然是夏季炎熱，疾病易生的關係。面欲確保市民衛生，避免霍亂等病菌之侵襲，非强化衛生行政不可！</p>
<p>自近幾年來，衛生行政方面，除强迫注射防疫針外，其他衛生行政，尙未着手。這雖然是格於經濟物資的欠缺，但有些地方，似乎還可以盡些力的，而一方面市民謀生已感焦頭爛額，對於衛生方面，無暇注意，亦屬必然之趨向。然而當此夏令，非加以防範，則一旦罹病，醫藥之費旣難負擔，而生命之喪失亦屬意中，姑以犖犖大者，申述如下：</p>
<p>用水方面：自電力限制，用水方面市民多鑿井而飮，以補不足，然井水決無自來水可靠，如一旦有一家用戶，以帶菌之衣物洗滌，而侵入井中者，則傳染之速，不可響邇，定必釀成時疫。民國卅一年南市霍亂猖獗，以井水傳染為最大原因，職是故也。再者汚水之宣洩，力求通暢，倘積滯久之，定使回流井中，則其為害更盛。又防空洞中之積水，亦應有　當之淸除辦法。</p>
<p>消除穢積垃圾：垃圾之害，盡人皆知，其藏垢納穢，滋生蚊蠅，為病菌淵　，故定須竭力淸除，勿使堆積，實刻不容緩，然市區僻弄，每有無數垃圾堆積，若浦東南市等處，甚有經年堆積而未淸除者，想衛生當局未暇注意及之。市民蒙害甚矣！陽光薰蒸，臭惡欲哎，微風激蕩，則飛揚四散，雨天則穢積隨水澈流，浪藉遍地。亟應改善。</p>
<p>檢騐魚肉冷飮物品：腐敗之魚肉，每含有毒素，食之足以致病，革命家街頭小販之冷飮食物亦當注意其是否潔凈，如無罩任蠅聚積，責令改良。</p>
<p>防疫注射須加以消毒：防疫針之注射，實當局之美意善策，然有若干地區，注射技師忽略注射器具之消毒，務服態度尤令人為之蹙額，致使有潔癖者，反以注射為苛政，而多方逃避，因此有以注射證明書作舞弊者，　害衛生行政，　此為甚！</p>
<p>關於宣傳方面：各報宜發行防疫特刋，以增市民防疫知識，或張貼淺顯文字圖畫，以示不注意衛生之種種害處。</p>
<p>嚴厲處罰違害衛生者：如街頭傾倒垃圾，隨地便溺等類，若浦東等處，更有在河中洗刷便桶者，非加以處罰，不足以儆効尤。</p>
<p>增設時疫病院：倘市民患疫後，貧賤者無力延醫，旣危害本人生命，又有傳染之虞，故非增設時疫病院，免費施治不可。</p>
<p>抑平藥價：對於抑平藥價，當局曾數數吿誡，然結果言者諄諄，聽者藐藐。蓋普通平民已無力購藥，藥商則鑒於百物昂漲，非課重利，不肯出售，僵局已成，不可矯正。衛生當局應會同經濟當局對於藥物管理，消滅黑市，予以有效之措置。</p>
<p>以上所述雖為老生常談，然欲求確保衛生，衛生當局非致力於此種種則不足有濟，嗚呼！民　深矣，安能再益以意外之禍患，甚望當局有以注意及之。</p>

<p>在熱浪薰蒸的季節，我們勞苦階層的一羣，在揮汗工作之餘，唯一的消夏好處，看來祗有綠陰深處的公園吧！尤其在這生活程度極度高漲的今日，一般薪工階級的小市民，衣食尙且不保，那裏還有餘力來尋求什麽消遺娛樂，每天日出而作，辛辛苦苦的忙着各人的工作，到晚間總想抽出一些空閒，好好的憇息一下，外灘公園便是他們心目中的好去處，因為那裏有自然的凉風，菁葱的樹木，和碧綠一片的海灘，靠在江邊的靠椅上小坐片時，閒眺着小艇三五隨波盪漾，耳畔暢聆着波聲和樹響，使人們一天的疲勞完全忘掉，不禁心曠神怡，獲得無限的樂趣，尤其在悶熱的夏夜，　處於白鴿籠式的屋子的一羣，更　得公園是他們極樂天堂。</p>
<p>自本年七月一日起，市政當局為謀大衆福利起見，已將外灘公園開放時間調整為每日上午六時至下午八時止，一般市民莫不欣然色喜，但是讀者認為上項開放時間僅至八時，似嫌過早，蓋工作階層於用過晚膳後，大都在七時前後，始有餘閒時間，散步公園，藉解悶氣，而事實上公園於七時三刻左右即吿停閉，市民們唯一的享受馴至無法領略，除少數轉向其他方面尋求娛樂外，大多數的苦悶羣衆，乃有望門興嘆的感想，竊意在此節約電力管制燈火的時期，當局所以將公園開放時間限制，不無相當原因，惟在可能內，深盼市政當局能予展放至九時半以后，俾一股小市民多得一點最低限度的生活調劑，於市民的健康與衛生上，或亦不無小補吧！</p>

<h3>學校疏散及搶救失學</h3>
<p>— 榮</p>
<p>現在本市各學校暑假之期將滿，且各級學校已在開始招收下學期新生，其餘各校大約亦在積極籌備中。處此時局及物價問題非常嚴重化之時，各級學校當局對於下學期開學諸問題，固不免有難於應付之感。</p>
<p>學校疏散之建議，　傳巳久，本報社評亦巳一再申論。但至目前為止，尙未聞有計劃實行者，此並非各校當局不明疏散之利弊，恐因實際上困難太多，先待設法解決也。聲望較差之大中學校，根本不足以　疏散；否則亦必造成相等於解散之後果。而聲　　著之學校，如欲疏散，値得考慮之問題亦屬甚多：第一，各校本學期結束時學生人數已較入學時相當減少，此輩學生大都隨同家長回鄕或向他處疏散；故各校目前大部份舊生，其家長皆有不便離滬之理由。若謂家長能隨同子弟疏散至同一地點，必佔絕對少數。第二，較為富有之學生家長，對於疏散地之治安，俱抱懷疑或不信任之態度。若能為其子弟學業而仍資送子弟隨校入學，恐亦僅佔少數而巳。反之，其子弟原來就學之學校，如經疏散，固亦不難另覓一理想較次之學校，繼續就學。子弟與家長同在一地，究屬就便於照顧，至少尙可得到暫時之安心。第三，在目前交通運輸十分艱難之時，學校當局欲將實騐儀器及應用設備搬運至疏散地點，不特需費浩大，且運送包裝沿途保護亦非易事。第四，各校現任敎員，兼任他職或他校敎職者，比比皆是。彼等集數處之收入，方得維持一家生計。如若隨一校疏散，收入方面，必致減少。雖然疏散地生活費用較低，但鑒於過去物價之直綫上漲，心有餘悸。開學之時，或能應付，以後窘迫之情，即難免與日俱增，設有支絀之事，人地兩生，更少補救方法。</p>
<p>綜上以觀，學校疏散最宜自公立學校做起，其理由甚明：第一，公立學校學費較低，學生較多，最近本有容納不下之勢；故疏散之後，學生人數不虞不足。第二，公立學校，無論國立市立，較易獲得當地政治機關及交通機關之助力。疏散地治安之確保，以取得一般家長之信任，以及儀器設備之運搬及保護等，固非取得各有關當局之協助不可。第三，公立學校敎員本有俸米之配發，疏散之後，可委託疏散地政府當局代撥，敎師生活可較安定。第四，公立學校，疏散之後，如發生經濟上之問題時，仍可籲請敎育部或敎育局統籌設法，如舉辦貸金等，以作臨時之救濟。如公立學校一經疏散成功，私立學校，隨環境之需要，乃能隨之而起。</p>
<p>以上所述，乃為關於學校疏散問題之商榷。但本市人口未經充分疏散以前，為維持留滬學生之學業計，多數學校恐仍將於本市開學。惟因最近特價暴漲，各學校皆有下述之困難：第一，為兼顧敎員之生活及家長之負擔，學費標準甚難訂定。第二，物價高漲後市民生活皆受威脅，因而失學學生勢必大增；故一般留滬學校，有學生不足之虞。第三，米價飛漲及水電之加緊限制，使各校不能招收寄宿學生。此點足以影響遠道學生之學業。第四，學費增加後，各學校之獎學金助學金不敷分配。此點足以造成淸量學生之失學。</p>
<p>市政當局，為搶救未來國家主要翁之失學，亟慶盡力設法。第一，治本辦法當為　平物價減除民生之痛苦。第二，設法繼續敎職員必需品之配給。第三，多設　務學校。第四，敎育局應嚴密監督各校學業之進度及經濟之支配，並應協助各校解決進行上之障礙。几此種種如能合理解決，當可使失學學生盡量減少也。</p>
<h3>婆羅洲及其附　形勢圖</h3>
<p>敵方　　混合軍自上月十五日對婆羅洲峇厘巴板一帶展開　烈砲轟以來，歷時半月，至本月一日方在峇厘巴板附近蘇坡嘉克拉碼頭强行登陸，最近並在婆羅洲北部之米里及泰拉干沿海岸森林地帶，企圖　大橋頭堡，連日經日方守備隊及海空軍之奮勇迎擊後，敵受創頗重，攻勢已挫，無法　進。</p>

<h3>舅父</h3>
<p>— 沈淵</p>
<p>燦爛的陽光閃耀在眼前，　　上的爬山虎飾上了釉綠的葉子。小河裏的水是柔軟的；給微風吹皺　，映在水面的一片藍天也給揉碎了。</p>
<p>拐過　，我的脚步遲疑地停在一個古舊的宅子門口，這裏我沒有被喚起懷舊的情感。那份情感已經深深地埋在左近的一堆瓦礫和雜草裏了。</p>
<p>走過廳堂，方磚上響起淸亮的足音，簷前的雀兒紛紛的噪然飛走。</p>
<p>在廊下，我見到一個老者浴在光耀的陽光裏。</p>
<p>「二舅。」我隨口叫出了。</p>
<p>「是你，想不到你會來的。」帶着詫異，那含糊的聲音從脫了牙齒的漏縫裏送出來。我覺得這聲音仍然是親切的。</p>
<p>進了屋子，二舅隨手把那册「人間詞話」掩上了。我們相顧默然。他怕有很多的話　在心際。我覺得他很激動。</p>
<p>「幾年不見了？」</p>
<p>「九年了。」我早就盤算過。「是外祖母去世的那個年頭。」</p>
<p>「日子過得好快呀。」</p>
<p>站在二舅面前的人，不僅已經長大成人，而且個子頎長，使他感到意外。他抖擻地把瘦弱的手按上我的肩膀。</p>
<p>「日子過得快好，還是過得慢好呢。……這些日子你們母子倆……？你們該沒忘記我吧。」</p>
<p>「舅父，我們　念着你呢。」</p>
<p>虛偽的話，使我的心跳得厲害。「我不能不安慰他。」其實忙着應付生活的磨難，那兒再能挪開一份心情去憐憫別人？即使偶爾記起，也祇像　天的陽光在雲端移過。</p>
<p>沉默着。</p>
<p>我端詳了一下二舅的容貌：消瘦的臉，牙齒掉落太多，以致雙頰陷了進去。頭髪半白。他的　光已經遲鈍，不過現在乾涸的眼眶裏，有了一點淚痕，似乎還有些光彩。</p>
<p>「說話呀，麟兒，小時候你是多活潑的。」</p>
<p>還不待我發掘積壓着的記憶，屋裏閃出一個瘦小的婦人。她很拘謹地趨向前來。她的服飾和舉止顯然不是屬於年靑的一代的，但在年老的羣裏，她顯得很年靑。</p>
<p>「這是舅母。」</p>
<p>「舅母還沒見過呢。」我欠一欠身子，像是行一個禮。</p>
<p>舅母是個能幹的人。她善於待人接物，我並不感到她的矯蹂造作。用孩子們的稱呼，她稱我為「麟哥。」她忙着招呼我坐下，遞過茶來，接着又忙着親自去安排午餐了。她向舅父徵求同意似的說：</p>
<p>「我看，得叫吳媽去買斤　魚呢。」</p>
<p>「麟兒。」二舅　切地呼着我的名字。「你給我想想看。人家還嘲笑我呢，這麽大的年紀還得續娶，你知道我的苦衷嗎？……七八個兒女都不在身邊，他們難道眞摔了我不成。再說了大哥，他們將來也得婚嫁，這些事難道可以沒人照管嗎？……」</p>
<p>黑漆的方桌上，睡着一隻貓兒，它正打着盹，也像在着　　什麽似的。</p>
<p>一切都　得　　。</p>
<p>我　　想起親戚們對二舅的議論。</p>
<p>「……他們管不到我，添孩子，那也是命裏注定的。……我看我受的這些折磨總還沒够呢。」</p>
<p>於是我們暢談別後的一切。流浪的生活，和窮困的掙扎，這些話是沒完盡的。年老的人用感喟把它們串了起來。他們在悠長的歲月裏沒有經歷到這般的痛苦和寃屈。</p>
<p>將近中午時分。舅母也許已經把一切打點舒齊了，抱了孩子，逕着他笑，叫我聲「麟哥」，孩子却全然不懂事的放聲哭起來。在舅父事業有成的呵責下，她忙着把孩子抱開去。原來舅父正和我談起去年的收成特別壞，積着的債務不能淸償，佃戶又有退租的。他陷於不能想像的困境。他又埋怨子女的不體諒他。在激動的心情下，他意把希望　在我身上：</p>
<p>「跟你談　，我覺得還是你有出息，通達人情。你得好好地幹去，不要辜負了你媽和我的希望。</p>
<p>二舅的臉上拂過了一陣悒然的微笑。</p>
<p>我不能吿訴他，要是我眞和他有了關涉，他就會感到我決不會體諒他的。</p>
<p>凉快的風陣陣的吹送道　裏。水氣在陽光裏冉冉上升，把影子印在窗　上和窗外的瓦楞上。我的心。我的心被染上了一點重濁的　抑。我向窗外看到的也祇是庭院裏一塊狹小的天空。</p>
<p>舅父向老媽子吩咐道：「預備午飯，打點兒酒來。」回過頭來，他向我說：</p>
<p>「這些年來，我老是貪飮。我也管不了什麽　羽不弱的，……麟兒，今天你陪我一杯，我原來是反對年靑人喝酒的。可是……」</p>
<p>於是我的記憶裏悠然地浮起一個畫面：夏日的傍除，暑氣消失了，我伴着二舅在佈置得潔凈的院落裏喝酒，讓凉爽的晚風輕拂着；偶爾抬頭有蝙蝠的影子掠過在暗　的天空，向幽晦的角落裏去——那種恬靜的生活。</p>
<p>窗外響起了鴿鈴，嘹亮的聲音正徘徊在藍天的深處。</p>
<p>於是，我又對着自己說：「讓我的遐想給帶走吧。」</p>
<h3>往那裏去？</h3>
<p>— 志雲</p>
<p>畢業後往那裏去？學校聽說也將停辦；</p>
<p>商業大都是投機，囤積，在這民不聊生的時分社會簡直不希望畢業羣。</p>
<p>父母也許要失望，失望跟着兒女的畢業而來，養了兒女也不中用！</p>
<p>我曾幾次偷窺父母憔悴的臉容。</p>
<p>我始終設法去安慰，說這只是暫時的現象。</p>
<p>我也幾次碰了壁，受人譏嘲，</p>
<p>像一隻失去了方向的汽艇，在圓形的死湖中打旋。</p>
<p>消磨了多少寶貴的光陰和機遇，而我還是想着：「往那裏去」？</p>
<p>然而，「畢業即失業」我始終否認。</p>
<p>雖四周是一個牢固的黑色的鐵環。</p>
<p>也總要堅毅地開出一條我應該走的路！</p>
<h3>雞　童年雜誌</h3>
<p>— 王允</p>
<p>裏，那隻麻里雞雖一氣蹲了十幾天的光影，我們給它送飯都送厭了，它還是不動一動，哥哥爬在地上，用手揪起它的尾巴，張着嘴，看裏面有了小雞沒有，老母雞却十分地怒了，那一片片的羽毛，更是聳得可怕，用喙要哥的頭，哥哥敲着它的窩邊，　　喝喝地唱：</p>
<p>「你明早不把小雞交出來呀——我便把你殺了哇！」</p>
<p>老母雞半欠起身體驅逐我們。</p>
<p>一天上午，散學，和同學一路打打鬧鬧地。哥哥把隔壁禿五摔了個跟斗，我們才奏凱似地回家。</p>
<p>！老母雞出窩了，它高興地領着三隻雛兒，在庭院中作第一次的巡禮。</p>
<p>咕咕！咕咕！……</p>
<p>老母雞的　子一探探地前進着，小雞前前後後地緊跟去，像三團小絨球兒在滾：黑的，紅花的，白的。</p>
<p>噍噍！噍噍！……</p>
<p>「十個蛋只落了三隻！」奶奶坐在門限上，惋惜着。</p>
<p>這給我們却添了不少歡樂的資料；每天拆把米餵它們，看那小喙噠！噠！地啄着地皮，覺得怪有趣的。</p>
<p>後園，一片平坦的綠草地，幾株屈腰伸臂的老柳，嫩枝，綠葉密密地遮起了天空，天上老　　　地，陽光，透過孔　　　不寒不暖，　在風絲裏，送來一陣溫暖，寂靜！島　樹開滿一頭小黃花，一羣蜂在那裏盤旋，嚶嚶着奏一　小曲。</p>
<p>噍噍！——噍噍！</p>
<p>小雞偎着它的母親，縮着　兒，臥在小草裏，爪兒搔搔喙尖，幽幽地望望這新奇的世界，倦來，小眼睛上蒙起張薄薄的白　。</p>
<p>噍噍！——噍噍！</p>
<p>小雞們一天天長大了起來！</p>
<p>小雞，少了一隻白的，我和哥哥急得什麽似的找，沒有，隔幾天，井中撈起了它的屍骸。</p>
<p>又一個大風的晚上，　貓碰開了雞窩，啣走了一隻。</p>
<p>「不要哭！以後再孵。」父親每次都養生地給我們寬慰。</p>
<p>染了雞瘟，老母雞嗄！嗄！地咳了兩天，又不聲不響地死去了。</p>
<p>「那是想他的孩子！」哥哥悲悽地想着我，我便立刻感到實在對不起老母雞了！</p>
<p>一隻了！它天天踽踽凉凉地走來走去，時時停下來，側着頭傾聽，傾聽，……</p>
<p>「母親呢？兄弟呢？」</p>
<p>噍噍！——噍噍！</p>
<p>彷徨，失望地呼叫。</p>
<p>一個秋雨的傍晚，它又沒了！我得遍搜屋角，柴堆。沒有！到後園去，哥哥咂着嘴叫：</p>
<p>「啪啪！啪啪！」</p>
<p>沒有回音。雨打着樹葉，沙沙作響。</p>
<p>到一叢長草旁查看半響，才聽到　細的一聲呼叫，我爬進去，才把它掏出來，哥哥吸了一口氣。</p>
<p>「養雞不生蛋，要它幹嗎！」小雞頭上抽出冠來，奶奶撅起了嘴。</p>
<p>可是我們偸着一把把的米去餵它。</p>
<p>冠兒抽得更高，血紅。</p>
<p>咯！咯！——</p>
<p>我正扣着上衣鈕：「聽，小雞打鳴了！」</p>
<p>哥哥快樂得笑起來。</p>
<p>冬夜，淸冷，月光把西屋的黑影投下天井，極分明地劃開了兩半。一顆星跳躍在月弦上，通紅的一隻眼。</p>
<p>咯，咯—咯！鷄在報曉了。</p>
<p>「起晚點吧！不苦嗎？」母親愛憐着我們。</p>
<p>哥哥却高興地說：「不！跟我們的雞一塊睡，一塊起！」</p>
<p>它眞也長大起來了。一次，把大娃家的白雞，啄得頭破血出。以後，見了它，便沒命地跑開，它跟着賣糖老頭子的棍子飛舞，老頭子怎麽也打不着它。到我家來的人倘冒犯了它，便挨牠一嘴。東隣婆婆為了這個，天天詛咒它：一隻兇惡的雞！</p>
<p>「過年拿來殺去祭　。這樣的兇！」奶奶說。</p>
<p>「看你殺！」哥哥不服氣。</p>
<p>母親却同情我們，說：「兇惡些倒好！東隣婆婆天天　過來，叨叨些東瓜紅棗。末後，還要問你奶奶要些東西才走。這，她又來了！</p>
<p>春天來的時候，那隻雄雞出落得更加高大，一隻腿獨立在牆頭上，微風吹飄起那一　紅褐的尾翎。雄赳赳地高啼兩聲，神采煥發。</p>
<p>咯—咯！咯—咯！</p>
<p>奶奶走，跟着一個大漢，手裏提着網。</p>
<p>我害怕得驚叫起來。急忙攘起手去攆它：</p>
<p>「吃—吼！」</p>
<p>那人趕上去，一網砸下。</p>
<p>撲拉，撲拉，……</p>
<p>它歪了歪身子，哎呀，終於脫險了！它振起雙翼，逃到門外。</p>
<p>那人緊跟了去，我哭了！跑去亂呼一陣，它又飛上了東隣婆婆的屋頂上</p>
<p>咯噠！咯—噠！</p>
<p>雄雞是不常大叫的，它受了這樣窮追，叫着了我覺得受到莫大的侮辱，恨恨地怒罵那人。</p>
<p>那人看我一眼也不看，兩手在無情的揩他頭上的汗。</p>
<p>東鄰婆婆却上房攆了它下來，它在空中飛舞。</p>
<p>那人的網套下了！</p>
<p>嘎！嘎！……</p>
<p>掙扎；又被扣在網裏。掙扎；那人一手揑起了它的　子，胡亂地箞到他的雞籠裏。</p>
<p>我失望地哭，……</p>
<p>「別哭，這錢都給你」！奶奶把兩手的銀角子擺在我眼前。</p>
<p>我一手打去，銀角子撒了滿地，亂滾。</p>
<p>「受屈了，孩子！」</p>
<p>母親搯着兩隻濕手走來，拉着我走，我哭，母親也掉下淚來。</p>
<p>哥哥知道了，低着頭要找奶奶去，母親扯住他，他也生氣地哭了一塲。</p>
<p>從此，我們便失掉了那隻報曉雞！……</p>

<h3>中日壘球戰熊貓不幸敗於日僑</h3>
<p>— （斌）</p>
<p>五比六…相差一分</p>
<p>棒球運動近數年來在我國巳不甚多見，筆者素爲一棒球迷，近閱報得悉滬上有公開壘球聯賽，且有我華人熊貓隊參加比賽。乃於四日驅車前往作壁上觀，是日乃熊貓隊戰日僑隊。此二隊之球藝及是戰經過，筆者以陋見略作批評如下。</p>
<p>是賽華隊以六比五，以一分之差敗於日僑。查日本國民對於棒壘球運動素甚注重，且視之爲國技之一。在此戰華隊之失敗，並非無因。就筆者所見，此戰華隊之敗，乃在缺少鎭靜。此外在進攻方面亦覺太弱。反之，在日隊中，各員之球塲經騐似略勝一着。且是日該隊之擊球甚佳，尤以游擊蘇若，捕手三浦爲最。聞是日華矇有二將王慶瑞及溫瑞雄臨時誤卯，由捕手王秀山及敎練梁扶初親自出馬，亦無濟於事。然梁君究不失爲老將。雖年事已老，但其身手依然敏捷，曾妙接殺一壘數次。而捕手王君，球路似覺生疏，缺少練習所致。</p>
<p>日隊擊球甚佳華隊缺乏鎮靜</p>
<p>是賽過程相富緊張。在第一二局中，華隊由於二三壘間之漏接，迎失二分。但照筆者觀察，些二分之失實由於日隊之妙擊。如第一分之失，乃由於日隊井下君擊出一低而沿三壘邊綫之急球，此球實難於接獲。又如蘇若在第二局擊出一僅越人頭之平行急球。此二種擊球在棒壘球賽中，十九能平安上壘，無怪熊貓諸將對之束手無策。但此賽中筆者所欲評述者，乃在華隊之缺乏鎭靜及失常，例如在第五局中，中堅王念茲曾漏接植島擊出之高球，此一漏接使三浦歸壘及植島得一「二壘安打」。而捕乎王秀山在同局中，誤會日隊已有二人出局，乃在岩立偸二壘時，急擲二壘手溫天華，而在三壘之植島乃得乘機急步歸壘。王君此一擲殺是否出於誤會，不得而知。要或王君出此妙計，以誘植島離壘，而由溫天華擲歸本壘由捕手接殺，亦未可知。但無論如何，王君此一投擲，實亦缺少鎭靜而不謹愼之故也。</p>
<p>若能謹愼進攻尙可轉敗爲勝</p>
<p>至於熊貓擊球方面，筆者在以往熊貓數戰中，未曾參觀。但此戰中，尙覺各員擊球技術，未達完善之境。在第四局中，敎陳梁扶初曾妙擊一棒，而使在二三壘之鍾保羅，李啓整歸壘。梁君究爲棒球老將，若非梁君揮棒，此二分恐亦不能獲得。最可惜者，在最後一局中，華隊諸將倘能鎭靜猛擊，尚有獲勝希望。蓋此時僅敗一分，且有二人二三在壘，只須得一「安打」，即可造成平局，或可轉敗爲勝。惜華隊梁友文，梁友義均用短樺，被捕手三浦從容接獲其擊出之高球，遂致奠定敗局。</p>
<p>叙述日隊優秀以供華隊參考</p>
<p>最後筆者以個人之觀察，對於日僑隊之優劣點，略述一二，以供奉隊在第二循環再戰時之參考。筆者細察日僑隊之擊球人員次序，以善擊者排在最先，如野上·井下·岩化。　　。蘇若。三浦等等，而輪至最後均爲不善　者。故日隊之勝利機會，均在最初三四局中，倘在此數局巾，能謹愼守防此數員之進攻，不使其有上壘獲分，則其能否以後取勝，尙屬疑問。而在日僑防守方面，當以二三壘間爲最佳，其外翼均屬平庸，接球尙現慌張。而捕手三浦出手甚快，不可不防之，故偷壘勿輕易嘗試。而投手植島，脾氣相當急燥，若連敗數分，必現慌張，　必連擲野球。但此公之左　，甚爲厲售，須謹愼接其擊出之高球爲</p>
<p>明日熊貓出戰葡商</p>
<p>聞明日（八日）上午十時半，華隊熊貓將遇葡商於霞飛路　興路俄體會球塲，葡隊乃去年聯賽冠軍，隊員如「全壘打」，能手湯拔拉·馬山兒·奧力維拉等等，均爲個中好手。華隊在聯賽中能否奪得錦標，將視其戰勝葡商爲斷。又十二日（星期四）下午四時半熊貓出戰海賊，海賊隊雖技術平庸，但華隊不能過於輕敵，以免出冷門。</p>
<h3>中實網球義賽　下週末舉行</h3>
<p>中實網球會網球義賽，上期已有記載，經本週的探悉，知道該會對此義賽，已有積極的進行，日期己決定下週末舉行。常局爲隆重起見，將敦請林康侯主持開球儀式，並泱請女星行給獎典禮，是則届時的一番盛况，當然在預料之事。今年夏季網球如此冷派聲中，目然這是一塲特別足以號召的網球賽。</p>
<p>筆者曾走訪該會負責人馬潤芳作談話，這次該會的義賽，一切開支，均由該會負担，所得劵資，悉數損於申新兩報的助學金。該會的目的，無非借這機會，提倡網球，兼以加惡淸寒學子。</p>
<p>這一塲比賽，應該說是本年度唯一的網球賽，球迷們爲着欣賞網球的唯一機會，我眞誠地盼望不要坐失此良機，票價分五萬元（榮譽劵）二萬元，（普通劵）兩種，榮得劵方面，已由當局委託各方銷售一空。</p>
<p>參加義賽的球員及其秩序，已由當局正在酊排中。據我所曉得的，王文正。陶冠球，張定劍。周冠軍，李磊石等，均將出塲比賽。事實上，滬江網球壇上除了這幾位明星還有話呢？最足使我們翹盼解決的那常是是王文正和　冠球的問題，他們兩位從來沒有正式交鋒過。這一次，內定兩人必須分一個高下。這眞是我們的眼福，誰不想着這塲精彩的單打解決霸主的比賽。一</p>
<p>該會定今日下午三時，招待體育界和新聞界，當然在這茶會席上。他們將予我人以最大的介紹和說明。</p>
<h3>楊氏籃球邀請賽點綴夏令風光</h3>
<p>— 潔</p>
<p>永大銀行總經理楊叔　氏對於籃球，素是提倡。最近楊氏因鑒於滬上　球運動以塲地之缺乏，不免較以往爲冷寂，特舉行邀請賽，敦請海上籃球六强角逐，地點即假大華路楊氏球塲。雖屬籃球非夏令運動，但假此機會以稍舒筋骨，誰日不宜。換言之，藉此時之以點綴夏令風光，誠値得我人一提者。據記者探悉，楊氏此次所以舉辦此邀請賽者，全注意於興趣與夫水準之提高。故比賽將不設錦標，日後將由六張之中產生錦標隊後，由另五隊公宴錦標隊，以資聯歡爲目的。所謂六强者，不妨先介紹</p>
<p>仁餘隊</p>
<p>仁餘隊在海上之歷史，可稱悠久。向爲談星波君所主持，茲悉談君已離滬他去。但談君臨別時曾重託陳渭源主持。陳君愛重託之下，特請胡甘伯爲領隊，顏意誠爲管理，指導係王炳南，隊長由老將余　子担任。隊員爲李羅和·林維聽·陳渭源·王槐庭·姚文彝·何文德·沈　舉·王楚卿等。林　聰之歸返母隊，以及新人何立德之　獎參加，俱浩成該隊實力强盛。對水準方面，該隊決求卯上也。</p>
<p>紅隊</p>
<p>紅隊大致爲楊氏隊之精銳部，隊員若陸鐘恩·許文奎。楊元龍輩，久有聲譽。該隊時在該塲操練，則地頭蛇之威風，不言可喻，我人當可拭日以視其持殊之戰績也。</p>
<p>藍隊</p>
<p>藍隊爲楊氏之乙組部隊，健將如魏當蓀等，亦籃球界中之好手。加以楊氏之督導有方，初生之犢，未必長虎，届時自有其超然之表演，以　我人。</p>
<p>華南</p>
<p>華南劉家將一度喧赫於時，旋以健將之紛散，無形解散。論者，無不對此一支有希望之新軍，抱無窮之惋惜。此番以何金貴之返滬，李瑞雄之再歸，華南並有劉家將，當不失過去威風。</p>
<p>振源</p>
<p>該隊雖係乙組中之翹楚，邇來滬馬　希之指導，球　日道月異，令人刮目相看。加之　天烈之從中指揮，可種相得益彰，故在此邀請賽中，必有野人之演出，即該隊本身，亦決不自低其身價。</p>
<p>幽鷺</p>
<p>幽隊爲本届籃球聯賽乙組總冠軍，其成績自爾不凡。該隊指導爲前西人隊巨人之台柱凱捷密洛夫。凱氏非特智足多謀，抑且本人之球藝在水準以上。此次爲提高幽鷺之爭首流起見，決將親自助陣。以凱氏之身手，與諸小將　決演出，其精湛處，殆有非我人所臆料中者。</p>
<p>總之，楊叔鼎氏之此番舉辦邀請賽，全係還有興趣及實力最爲平衝之六隊，取其有不能　料之成績也。大華路畔屆時之籃球迷，必紛紛以去。而爲下屆提高水準之張本，可無異疑矣。</p>
<h3>談羽毛球（三）</h3>
<p>— 廉</p>
<p>消化器官</p>
<p>資勝白所著家用醫藥書中說：「凡人宜運動，若不運動，則肌肉及血液循環。皆受其障礙，腸胃因以不健，種種消化不良之病，皆因此叢生。故運動與消化實相輔而行之事。」這種羽毛球運動，對於消化器，非常有益。例如挽救前面的低球，就必要身體向前彎曲，腹部受壓迫。接擊高來向後之球，上體盡量仰向後方。腹部肌肉便伸張，影響腸胃，使問接受極速的運動，腸胃便能强健。消化優良，慢性胃涎　炎，慢性胃病等病，便也無從發生。吾國女子患胃病的不少，急宜運動羽毛球。</p>
<p>精神土愉快</p>
<p>凡是運動各種球類，常運動的時候，都可以把一切的煩惱，憂愁，痛苦，忘掉得一絲不留在腦際。可是有了深刻的煩惱，去運動遲緩的游戲，那煩惱仍是盤旋在國際，不能去盡的。唯有玩迅速而急切的球戲，始能忘懷一切。因爲腦神經要趕快對付來球，也就不能再去籌思煩惱了。</p>
<p>羽毛球之起源</p>
<p>羽球是一種很有趣味的遊戲，也是很有利益的遊戲，又是很容易學習的遊戲。這種遊戲並不要像網球那樣必須多年的練習，却有同樣的利益，同樣的興趣，因此這種運動，沒有一人不喜歡的。</p>
<p>Badmintong是印度的俗話，這種運動，起源於印度的加爾各答·漫特爾等地方。拿一種毽子式的球，用兩塊木板在隨便什麽空曠的地方或者家裏，就玩這種遊戲。起初玩耍的人，大概都是小朋友們。以後英國人看見這遊戲很有價値，就把這種毽子式的球，改良一下。使球的重心，和球的重量，經科舉的硏究，便成現今通用的羽球。實在因爲這球是競爭遊戲，互相射擊的目的物，拍來拍去，就爲這樣。勝敗的分別，也爲這球。因此英文稱這球做Shutretock。英國倫敦而愛好運動的美國人，題上效法。法國人，也歡喜新穎的運動。於是這種羽毛球遊戲就風行全球了。</p>
<p>羽毛球構造</p>
<p>羽毛球分二部，球部和羽部。球是用軟木製成半圓的球形，叫做球面。球面的直徑，是一英寸，連接著「英寸長的圓柱形，叫做球身。球而外包裏着細羊毛。球身上插白羽毛。球面和絲帶球部的重量，火約重九分。遠輕，不甚適用。渦重則球來很快，初學的人，不適用，並且價値也昂貴。</p>
<p>部用輕白的雞毛，或白鴿毛，羽毛的長二英寸半，羽梗一英寸，羽毛一英寸半，羽梗插人球，身約半英寸，羽的未稍，要修剪。羽毛要用膠斗侵黏一下，羽梗用綫編縛，羽的重量，大約重五分。</p>
<p>全羽球的重量七十三克來姆到八十五克來姆。大概是一錢四分。最合用。現在新出的橡皮球部，初學的人。不甚合用，因球飛得很快。</p>
<p>羽毛球塲</p>
<p>羽球塲和網球塲，形式雖然相像，實在大不相同。網球塲的大小是一定不變的，過大過小，都不合法的。可是羽球塲，可以因地制宜，伸縮大小的，這就是羽球便利之處。不過劃界綫的形式，比網球塲的界綫，稍爲繁複。最普通的塲地，是長四十四英尺，關二十英尺。</p>
<p>球網</p>
<p>網要用細而結實的綫，結成一英寸方的網眼，使得羽球不能够穿過網眼。網　約三英尺，網長約二十二英尺，最長二十五尺，不像網球的網切近地面，要高揖在兩根柱上，網　地要五英尺自上邊垂直向下，五英英尺。不得過高過低。</p>
<p>網柱</p>
<p>用三英寸直徑圓的堅木，插人地中，約二三英尺多些，柱的全長，大概六英尺。</p>
<p>柱分固定的，移動的二種；移動的柱，要用鐵尖，做柱脚。深入泥士喪。固定的柱，埋人泥中，求穩固就好。但是綱柱切勿離開邊綫過遠，引起打球時的誤會。</p>
<p>球拍</p>
<p>球拍本來叫做Battledore在普通稱BahnintonTacket羽毛球拍，因爲從前印度土人的玩耍，確實是用兩塊木板。著者在民國十四年的那一年，逝歷印度還親眼看見過一次現在用綫來穿紮成拍，和網球拍相像。不過羽毛球拍很細，很輕，沒有網球拍那樣重罷了。</p>

<h3>Publication of Basic Principles for Governing Guangdong; Governor Chu Assumed Office Yesterday Morning, Summoned Government Officials for Admonishment After Taking Over the Seal</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 6th (Central News Agency) - Guangdong Province Governor Chu Minyi arrived in Guangzhou City by plane on the morning of the 6th. After a brief rest, he went to the Provincial Government to take over the seal and summoned the Provincial Government officials for admonishment.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Guangdong Province Governor Chu Minyi, accompanied by his entourage, flew to Guangdong on the afternoon of the 5th to assume his new post. Those who saw him off included Minister Zhao Zunyi, Minister Chuan Shishuo, Minister Chen Jun, Dai Ce, Li Quyi, Chen Jicheng, Chen Changzu, Gao, Zhang, and the Japanese Embassy's Minister Nei, Counselor Matsumura, Counselor Ota, Secretary Ozawa, Secretary Ikeda, and Intelligence Chief Kishi. The general principles were: "Guangdong Province is the source of the revolution and the hometown of both the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun, and the late Chairman Wang. It should be cherished in every way. Since the incident, due to transportation and geographical relations, its position among the provinces under the Father of the Nation has been relatively lower. Regarding Guangdong, we must first recognize the above two points. The former must be thoroughly understood, and the latter must be suitable. Therefore, after I arrive in Guangdong, I will make the greatest effort to implement the meaning of cherishing the people of Guangdong and to suit the situation in Guangdong. No matter when or in what environment, as long as a spark of vitality can be preserved, I will not hesitate to pay any price. As long as the people's livelihood can be stabilized, I will not be afraid of any hardship. Therefore, recognizing Guangdong Province is the basis for loving Guangdong Province, and loving Guangdong Province is the principle for protecting Guangdong Province. At the same time, we must follow the natural trend to stabilize the people's livelihood in Guangdong. Stabilizing the people's livelihood in Guangdong is the starting point for suitable Guangdong politics. The above two points can be said to be the basis and principles for my governance of Guangdong." Also, the Acting Chairman visited Mr. Chu's official residence on that day to bid him farewell.</p>
<h3>Valiant Counterattack by Japanese Garrison in Land and Air Battle of Balikpapan; High Morale Inflicts Painful Blows Everywhere</h3>
<p>Southern Base, 6th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy troops landed in Balikpapan, their strength had reached more than 15,000 by the evening of the 4th. The Japanese garrison forces launched a valiant counterattack. By that day, more than two enemy companies had been destroyed. To support their ground forces, the enemy dispatched more than 150 fighters and bombers daily to bomb and strafe the Japanese positions, and conducted slow-paced shooting at night. Under this intense bombardment by the enemy, the morale of the Japanese garrison forces grew even stronger, inflicting painful blows on the enemy everywhere they engaged them.</p>
<p>Objectives of Operations in Borneo</p>
<p>Shonan, 6th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's current Borneo operation focuses on invading resource areas, attempting to use Borneo's oil fields to supplement their fuel shortage. The steps and speed of their operations are closely related to the consolidation of bases in Okinawa and the timing and scale of operations against mainland Japan. Since June of this year, the U.S. military has used approximately 11,000 aircraft for the anti-Japanese war, consuming approximately 420,000 tons of aircraft fuel, and the ships transporting this fuel require approximately 600,000 tons. In addition, the fuel supply required by the mechanized units needed to support the air force is even greater. For example, in the recent four months alone, the fuel required for naval operations has reached 1.5 million tons. This huge amount of fuel is entirely dependent on supplies from the United States and the Middle East, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The output of Borneo's oil fields can supply up to 100% of the total required amount, but due to distance, this can save some ships. Therefore, this operation was launched, which can increase shipping efficiency several times compared to transporting fuel from the United States or the Middle East. Therefore, Borneo is very important to the enemy's fuel resource supply.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Deploys Strong Defenses in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 6th (Central News Agency) - It has been over a year since the enemy, Britain and the United States, clamored for a landing in South China. Recently, this propaganda has intensified, claiming that the opportunity for landing in Hong Kong, Xiamen, and other places is approaching. The Japanese side has long taken comprehensive measures to deploy strong defenses in Hong Kong and construct underground fortresses under the granite of the entire island. At the same time, the morale of the Japanese army is extremely high, and they are waiting in full battle array, ready to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<h3>Air Raids in Various Parts of Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - Led by a reconnaissance aircraft, approximately 90 fighter planes from the Iwo Jima base, divided into three groups, invaded Tokyo from near Choshi at noon on the 6th and attacked Ibaraki, Chiba, and Saitama, then departed after 15 minutes. Also, between 10:00 AM and noon, five aircraft and three aircraft operated in the southern part of the Izu Islands and Kujukuri.</p>
<h3>U.S. and Australian Authorities Announce Land, Sea, and Air Force Losses</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - Washington dispatch: The U.S. Army and Navy announced that since the start of the war to date, the losses suffered by the U.S. military were 1,030,693, an increase of 6,258 from the previous week.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - Guam dispatch: The command of Admiral Nimitz announced that the casualties of the U.S. military in the Okinawa operations totaled 46,319.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - San Francisco dispatch: Mr. Ford of the Australian Air Force Department announced on the 3rd the losses suffered by the Australian Air Force since the start of the war as follows: Since the start of the war, the Australian Air Force has suffered more than 13,800 casualties, half of which were suffered in the European theater. Specifically, there were 6,500 in Europe, 4,700 in the Southwest Pacific, 1,500 in the Middle East, 370 in the Far East, 300 in Burma, and 430 elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Voices of Peace Among the People in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Mainland Base, 6th (Central News Agency) - Chiang Kai-shek recently said, "The war against Japan will end within the next 18 months," exaggerating to win over the hearts of the people under his rule. However, according to various intelligence gathered locally, the voices of peace are very high in Chongqing. The youth and intellectuals there do not want the U.S. military to land in the coastal areas of China and are enthusiastically discussing the ceasefire of the Chongqing army and the withdrawal of Japanese troops. It is said that the ruling authorities are deeply afraid that this phenomenon will spread to various places and are suppressing these opinions. Although Chongqing calls for resistance, the hearts of the people under its rule are the opposite. The reasons are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>If the Chinese mainland becomes the decisive battlefield between Japan and the United States,</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Shino and Three Other Officers Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Announced Yesterday by the Sasebo Naval District</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Sasebo Naval District announced on the 6th the list of four Japanese officers who had died in battle: Lieutenant General Shino Katsukiyo, Major General Noguchi Gozaburo, Major General Hashimoto Uro, and Major General Yamauchi Teisho. It is inevitably difficult to avoid the devastation of Chinese territory and the destruction of facilities, preventing the progress of China's reconstruction. If we rely entirely on foreign forces to resist Japan, there will be no guarantee for the completeness of China's sovereignty after the war. All sectors of military, political, economic, and cultural affairs will be eroded by foreign forces. Even in Britain, where women are highly respected, the U.S. military is extremely licentious. If they invade the Chinese mainland, they will disrupt the pure bloodline of the Chinese nation. In particular, the intellectuals and young people who call for maintaining the purity of the national bloodline demand the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. military. Furthermore, reviewing China's modern history over the past hundred years since the Opium War, emotional warfare against Japan has only led China to destruction. This view is also quite persuasive. Recent broadcasts from Chongqing even echoed this sentiment, saying, "The Japanese army still has millions of elite soldiers, and even though some losses have been suffered, they still have considerable naval strength to cope with future battles." However, this phenomenon is not only prevalent in Chongqing. It is said that similar arguments are also occurring within the front-line Chongqing army in Hunan and Guangxi.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Analysis of Chongqing's Diplomacy with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>We have analyzed Song Ziwen's mission to the Soviet Union, believing it to be nothing more than the following three points: Improving Chongqing-Soviet relations, mediating Chongqing-Communist relations, and discussing the issue of the decisive battle against Japan. Now, we further analyze Chongqing's diplomacy with the Soviet Union as follows:</p>
<p>While improving relations between Chongqing and the Soviet Union is possible, the price to be paid will certainly be high. Not long ago, the Sixth National Congress of Chongqing, on the one hand, resolved to promote diplomacy with the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, issued a declaration denying the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic. Obviously, there is an unavoidable contradiction in this. And the fact can also prove that Song Ziwen's diplomacy has encountered hidden reefs in Moscow. Song Ziwen had not been in Moscow for a few days when the Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic also followed. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1924, Outer Mongolia is a protected territory of China. According to the resolution of the Sixth National Congress of Chongqing, the independence of Outer Mongolia should be denied. However, if Stalin uses the issues of Outer Mongolia or Xinjiang as conditions for exchange, improving Chongqing-Soviet relations will not be easy.</p>
<p>Can Chongqing-Communist relations be resolved by leveraging international forces? The United States can be said to have completely failed in mediating Chongqing-Communist relations. To pressure Chongqing to ease relations with the Communists aroused strong resistance from Chongqing, the Stilwell incident being an example. To unite Chongqing's forces to suppress the Communists resulted in the Harllee line becoming the target of condemnation by the Communists. Therefore, the United States thought of asking the Soviet Union to mediate from Chongqing. In Chongqing, there seems to be no other way than to negotiate with Moscow. However, although the Soviet Union has not provided practical assistance to the Communists in recent years, it is still sympathetic to the Communists. If the Soviet Union proposes the formation of a coalition government as the basic plan for mediating Chongqing-Communist relations, why would Song Ziwen need to go to Moscow?</p>
<p>Chongqing, the United States and Britain all hope that the war against Japan can end in the near future, because the longer the war drags on, the more unfavorable it is. Therefore, they are asking the Soviet Union to also participate in the war against Japan. The United States has already done a lot of enticing work on this issue, and this Three-Headed Conference may also discuss it. It can be said that Song Ziwen's mission contains the intentions of both Chongqing and the United States. However, after the end of the war against Germany, the Soviet Union has not yet recovered and what it needs most now is recuperation. At the same time, the prolongation of the war against Japan by Chongqing, the United States and Britain is a good opportunity for the Soviet Union to build up its strength.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the New Association Held a Current Affairs Reporting Discussion Yesterday; Minister Kuwahara Attended and Gave Guidance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Press Association held its fourth current affairs discussion meeting at the Mu Hua Club yesterday afternoon (the 6th). Naval Minister Kuwahara of the allied forces was invited to attend and give guidance. Those present included Minister Kuwahara, Lieutenant Matsumoto, Mr. Uzaki, and more than 20 representatives from various newspapers in the city, including Chen Binwu, Chen Riping, Lu Feng, and Yang Guangzheng. The main points of the discussion were as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) What are the trends in the war situation after the Battle of Okinawa?</p>
<p>(Answer) In the Battle of Okinawa, the brave attacks of our army's special forces inflicted huge losses on the enemy. Although it has now come to an end, the enemy will not be able to immediately continue large-scale operations after being wounded. Currently, both Japan and the United States can be said to be actively preparing. Japan has turned important locations into fortresses to defend the mainland.</p>
<p>On the U.S. side, they have started moving troops from Europe since May. Apart from a portion being transferred back to their home country, a portion is being directly transferred to the Pacific War. However, this preparation requires a considerable period of time. What can be accelerated is only the air force. Therefore, air raids on mainland Japan or mainland China may be more frequent than in the past. At the same time, ground troops are gradually concentrating in the Philippines. However, large-scale operations in the future must be coordinated with the British and Chongqing armies, so the preparation time is longer. A truly large-scale decisive battle is expected to begin in the spring of next year.</p>
<p>In the future, the actions of enemy aircraft may be more active, but the enemy's propaganda about controlling the air and sea is completely inaccurate. For example, the "Kontor Vandi" once had water leaking in, and its speed was slow and the target was large, but it safely arrived in Japan from Shanghai. Now Japan is engaged in transportation work, which is a counter-evidence. Other ships are still coming and going constantly.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the future development of the enemy's new offensive in Borneo, South Pacific?</p>
<p>(Answer) The enemy has started offensives in Tarakan, Borneo, and Balikpapan. The significance of this is that, on the one hand, the supply line is too afraid, and they want to obtain a base for kerosene close to Japan. On the other hand, they want to cut off the connection between Japan and the South Seas. However, this is a sign of the war becoming prolonged. The enemy paid a great price on small islands such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and they will suffer even more severe losses when operating on the large island of Borneo. Perhaps the US and British troops will echo each other, and new battles will also occur in Malaysia, Shonan, Java, Sumatra and other places in the future.</p>
<p>(Question) Can you elaborate on Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>(Answer) There were rumors of Song Ziwen visiting the Soviet Union when the San Francisco Conference was held, but Song Ziwen was sent back to Chongqing from San Francisco and then went to Moscow. Of course, there was a pre-arranged plan and he listened to Chiang Kai-shek's instructions. Now that Song Ziwen has met with Stalin, the issues discussed probably include the KMT-CPC issue and the Far East question after the war. The former is because the allied forces must contact the Yan'an army when landing on the mainland, so there must be contact in advance. According to foreign commentators, when the allied forces land on the mainland, there will definitely be various disputes with the Yan'an army, and this point is quite reasonable. As for the latter, the Soviet Union is planning to recuperate after the end of the war against Germany and will not be easily instigated. Even if the Soviet Union agrees to Zhu Ziwen's mediation of the Yan'an issue, it will definitely make significant demands, such as the Xinjiang Province or the Outer Mongolia issue.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the relationship between the Three-Headed Conference and the Greater East Asia War situation? (Answer) The issues discussed at the Three-Headed Conference probably include the following three: the final decision on the European handling issue; the issue of weak countries that are not suitable for discussion at the San Francisco Conference; the issue of Japan. Among these three, we are most concerned about the issue of Japan. The United States has repeatedly tried to win over the Soviet Union to participate. The main reason is to shorten the war and avoid the difficulties of a long-term war. As for the Soviet Union's attitude, although the Neutrality Treaty has been notified for abolition, it still maintains friendly relations with Japan, and the Soviet Union has no intention of driving its citizens to war after a long war.</p>

<p>Mobilizing Students to Reclaim Mountains and Forests</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - To ensure food resources during the decisive battle on the mainland, the Japanese government is mobilizing students nationwide on a large scale to actively reclaim flatlands and highlands after logging. On the 4th, the directors of the Agriculture and Commerce Ministry's Agriculture and Administration Bureaus, along with the director of the Ministry of Education's General Affairs Bureau, jointly issued a document to local officials, ordering them to form agricultural support teams in accordance with the decision made at the meeting in March of this year, mobilizing agricultural school students, higher-grade students of rural national schools, secondary school students, or some university students, for full-year service.

<h3>Soviet Troop Preparations: Partial Demobilization To Be Grandly Welcomed Nationwide</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Moscow, reported by TASS: Moscow and various cities in the Soviet Union are currently making extensive preparations to receive Red Army personnel who are older and being demobilized. Grand welcomes are being prepared everywhere. Major train stations and ports are preparing special storage depots to meet the needs of demobilized personnel, and various transportation facilities are also being prepared to give priority to demobilized personnel. The Leningrad Trade Union is preparing to send demobilized personnel in need of rest and recuperation to Karelia Isthmus, as well as scenic rest areas and sanatoriums in the suburbs of Leningrad. Soviet inspectors have issued orders instructing their subordinates to supervise the strict implementation of the demobilization law at all times. The Chief Military Prosecutor of the Red Army, all military prosecutors, and railway and shipping prosecutors have also received instructions to supervise the implementation of demobilization supplies and transportation, provision of occupations, housing, and fuel. Local authorities, directors of industrial enterprises, and chairmen of collective farms are taking various measures to ensure that demobilized personnel obtain work in their original or new occupations, and to create the best possible living conditions for returning national defenders. Kibolenko, Chairman of the Rostov Oblast Soviet, said, "Returnees can be assured that the Soviet people will do everything possible to provide our beloved liberators with everything they need. With the promotion of the Rostov people, the houses of demobilized personnel's families are being repaired. We are paying special attention to the issue of helping demobilized personnel to obtain occupations." Fanshelov, Chairman of the Yaroslavl Oblast Soviet, said, "Our job is to quickly provide heroes who fought for the country with work in industry and agriculture." The Soviet Republican Organization of the Kalinin Oblast has stipulated the timing and methods for using all repatriates in industry and agriculture. In the factories and offices in the state, and in the collective farms, all vacant positions have been registered for repatriates. The Gorky Automobile Plant in the Volga Basin is preparing to warmly welcome demobilized soldiers. The director of the factory, Loskotov, said, "We will treat them with care and attention. We will give them the best living and working conditions and help them improve their working skills." The plant is preparing to mass-produce "Victory" type new cars, as well as two and a half-ton trucks and other types of cars. Betyayev, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Gorky Oblast, said, "We believe that collective farmers will enable the majority of demobilized personnel to obtain important positions in agriculture. We are proud of the soldiers from the Gorky Oblast, because one hundred of these soldiers have won the title of Soviet Hero."</p>

<h3>British General Election Begins: Two Parties Vie for Power, Results Will Be Known on the 26th</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm on the 6th, according to news received here: On Wednesday late at night, the eve of the general election, loudspeaker vehicles traveled back and forth on the streets of London, and the slogans of the various political parties were shouted in the dusk, and the election people's groups were preparing to go to the polls. In several constituencies, the Conservative Party was still distributing leaflets and pamphlets in an attempt to sway voters in these final minutes. More than 1,500 candidates delivered various inflammatory speeches on the general election day to groups of women standing outside shops everywhere. Labour Party leader Attlee also toured his constituency yesterday morning. The general labor circle deeply hopes that Attlee can increase his supporters and defeat the Conservative Party leader, etc. In the Wandsworth district in southern London, commercial union leader Bevan is also using his very few Labor Party members to fight against the Conservative Party, which has the advantage of victory medals. Labour Party leader Morrison is also attacking the Conservative Party's strong fortress in southern London, claiming, "The election work is quite beneficial to me." In northern Airdrie (where former Prime Minister Churchill suffered his first protest demonstration while touring London), current Minister of the Navy Bracken is competing for a seat with Labor Party candidate Lieutenant General MacFarlane, which will cause a fierce battle. There is Labor Party leader Dalton, who will serve as the Minister of Commerce in the Allied Cabinet, who has prophesied, "The country will tend to the Labour Party. The Labour Party will receive from all eighteen constituencies nationwide." The general election is currently underway, but the results of the election are difficult to predict for a while, especially until the 26th, when there will be clear news.</p>

<h3>Mother Zhou, Madam Ma, Passes Away: Memorial Service Tomorrow at Jade Buddha Temple on Jiangning Road</h3>
<p>Mother Zhou, Madam Ma, passed away in Guiyang on June 25 this year. When the sad news came, the Zhou family was filled with grief. A memorial service will be held tomorrow (the 8th) at the Jade Buddha Temple on Jiangning Road in this city, and Deputy Director Zhou himself will write a memorial essay, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Memorial Essay Written by Deputy Director Zhou</p>
<p>On this sixth day of July in the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, your unfilial son, Fohai, tearfully makes offerings before the spirit tablet of his late mother, Madam Ma: Alas! Madam passed away in Guiyang on June 25. After six days, the spirit was moved and temporarily placed in Hongfangdi. Now, after accomplishing the main affairs, we respectfully perform the family memorial ceremony. It has been twelve days since Madam's passing. Recalling the death of my late father, it has been thirty-six years since then. In these thirty-six years, your bereft orphan has relied closely on the love of his compassionate mother to serve as the master of his heart and as the standard for his conduct and actions. From now on, your unfilial son will forever be a person without parents. Oh, Heaven, how painful! Recalling the days of my childhood, the only ones who surrounded Madam's knees were your son and his younger brother and sister. My late father went to Fujian and Hai, and with empty sleeves, he could not fulfill his aspirations and passed away. Madam endured hardship and self-sacrifice, without the concern for the family's livelihood, and she was only afraid that she could not fulfill her duties to the clan and party. She only feared that she would fail in raising and educating your unfilial sons. Those who were unpolished and childish, those who were the source of constant smiles and affection, are forever etched in my heart, vividly before my eyes. Your unfilial son is nearing fifty, floating and sinking in the sea of humanity, entering and leaving officialdom. People everywhere say that I have been able to do this because of the inspiration of Madam's spirit. This is what your unfilial son will benefit from for the rest of his life. Alas, Madam smiled and left peacefully, was it a dream? Could it be foretold? In the first year of the Republic, your unfilial son entered the county's advanced elementary school with flying colors, and Madam was overjoyed to hear of it. That year, your unfilial son declared his allegiance to the Owenite school rules, but still could not get a leave of absence. So, I carried my luggage and went to Changsha. After a painful admonition, Madam generously provided funds so that your unfilial son could finally express his governance a little. Then, your unfilial son returned to the county town, and with the support of his teachers and friends, he entered the county high school. He stood in the snow to seek knowledge and respectfully received instruction. The happiest and most joyful time of my life was really at this time. Your unfilial son's determination to study hard began here. In the sixth year of the Republic, with the help of teachers and friends, your unfilial son suddenly planned to study abroad in the East. Madam, driven by the virtuous desire to see her son become famous, suppressed her desire to keep him by her side and finally arranged his luggage so that he could depart. On the day of parting, Madam wept secretly in the kitchen. Alas, from then on, your unfilial son, seeking knowledge and serving the country, traveled north, south, east, and west, and could not stay by her side for long, and was always absent from filial duties. The misfortune of fate is indeed so cruel. In the seventh year of the Republic, due to circumstances, students studying in the East were ordered to return to the country. Your unfilial son's patriotism came from his nature, so he went from Tokyo to Andong to seek help from his fellow villagers. When he arrived in Andong, there was no place for him to stay, so he returned to the country, but the road ahead was vast. At this time, his studies had not yet been completed, but he jumped into the sea to make a living. With the love of his compassionate mother, he was even more courageous to move forward. So, he returned to Tokyo, from one high school to seven high schools, and then to Kyoto Imperial University. Fortunately, he completed his studies and became established. If it were not for the dream revelation of his compassionate mother, how could your unfilial son have achieved what he has today? Your unfilial son, together with the late Chairman Ren Gong and current Chairman Chen Gong, has vowed to promote peace for eight years. Your unfilial son understands the great meaning of the Three Principles of the People for building the country. He deeply knows that the party cannot be divided, and the country must be unified. Merely because of the differences between peace and war, there are the frictions of Wu and Shu. The flames of war welcome the sky, and the people's livelihood is impoverished. How can we save the people from water and fire and bring them to peace and tranquility? How can we rebuild the country from the ashes of scorched earth? The process is difficult, and the effort is especially hard. Your unfilial son, with his humble body, shoulders arduous responsibilities. When encountering difficulties, I cannot help but call out to my parents, but from now on, even if I cry to the sky, Madam will not respond to me. Alas, how painful! Since leaving home in the sixth year of the Republic, your unfilial son has not been able to set foot in his homeland again. Every time I think of returning home, there are always unexpected obstacles. In addition, due to military or political reasons, news from home has not been communicated often. Madam hoped for the success of your unfilial son's career and worried about the safety of your unfilial son. Joy, sorrow, fear, and horror, how can they be described? In these thirty years, she was welcomed to the capital twice. Madam lived a simple and comfortable life, but often, because she missed her homeland, she returned home quickly. After saying goodbye in the capital in the twenty-fifth year, the war broke out in the twenty-sixth year. In the winter, she returned to Hunan and eagerly thought of visiting her relatives. Hearing the news of the German envoy's mediation, she hurried back to Hubei, and was unable to pay her respects to Madam's face. Although I was on Chairman Wang's plane from Kunming to Hanoi for seven years, the first illusion that climbed me came into my mind, I wonder if I would not see my mother again in the future, and I also know that today's children's illusion is also for Bai Ye. Since the eighth year, I have sent people back to Hunan several times, eagerly thinking of welcoming Madam to Beijing and Shanghai. Madam was old and afraid of traveling far, and she wanted to go but stopped again and again. So, there was a trip to Guizhou, and she finally died while thinking of her hometown. If your unfilial younger brother, Fosheng, is still alive today, Madam would have been able to taste the soup personally and rely on him to take care of the funeral arrangements, so that your unfilial sister, Fozhen, would not have to bear the burden alone, and the kindness of hard work could not be repaid, but the heart of a child would be at ease. And who knows that Fosheng's death has been sixteen years today. Just as I was about to get excited, I was little sad, and I thought of the pain of the curtain. Alas, my grandsons, Youhai, have grown up and know literature and history, and my granddaughter, Shuhai, has married into the Qi family, and my granddaughter, Huanhai, has been engaged to the Wu family. They will surely miss and point to themselves. This is the blessing of Madam's spirit. Your unfilial son is worried about his remaining life, and the disease is personally questioned. I only have to devote my life's energy and effort to the great cause of the nation and the country, so that I can honor my ancestors and comfort my parents in the afterlife. Alas, I look to the west from afar, and my luck is squatting seedling, the bowl is still there, the smile is difficult to make, Wu Tian is at its extreme. Grief and sorrow, I hope that on the day of the tomb, I will respectfully present the text of the inscription. Alas, I respectfully ask for your acceptance.</p>

<h3>Japanese Defense Line Strengthened in Eastern Burma</h3>
<p>Since the enemy troops invaded Wa City, the Burmese war situation has shown a great change in the two months. As for the key to the change, it was the action of the powerful mobile unit of the enemy that crossed the Nianhe River south of Bairake in mid-February, and then on February 27, moved aggressively towards the center of the Burmese plain, Meiktila. This place is the key point of the Japanese army's Irrawaddy interception line, which winds for more than 100 kilometers. The enemy's invasion of this place was a risky move. Therefore, after the Japanese army's continuous counterattacks in early March, the enemy's air force was on the verge of annihilation. In addition to mobilizing air force from other areas to cover the flying force in Meiktila, the enemy also attempted to forcibly cross the river at various crossing points on the Irrawaddy River. Finally, due to the Japanese army's automatic withdrawal from Wa City, the enemy troops, under the cover of airplanes, used tanks as a vanguard to invade Jiaren, about 40 kilometers west of Sagaing, and continued to invade Miha, 20 kilometers west of it. At this point, the war situation in the central Burmese plain was in a state that was difficult to predict.</p>
<p>In addition, in response to the Irrawaddy decisive battle, the newly organized 30th and 38th divisions of the Chongqing government and the 80th and 36th divisions of the British Indian Army also went south. This army, together with the 11th East Philippine Division on the west bank of the Irrawaddy River south of Pangu, the 25th British Indian Division on the coast centered on Aen, and the 26th British Indian Division on the front of Ramree Island and Tongkapu, totaled a considerable force.</p>
<p>Taking back Wa City has been the enemy's long-cherished wish for four years. Now that they have achieved their wish, they will further hope to take back Yangon, which is expected. By mid-April, after the enemy troops along the Irrawaddy River had completed their reorganization, they began to move south with the mechanized troops in Meiktila as the vanguard. Although they suffered heavy losses from the Japanese army's fierce attacks, they gradually advanced south along the Wa City Avenue, passing through Yehmessen and arriving at Pinmana on the 19th of the same month. At this time, the rainy season was approaching, and the terrain near Tintaung was dangerous due to the hills blocking the east and west. If the enemy troops do not pass through this dangerous place before the rainy season comes, it will be difficult to advance into Yangon. Therefore, they hurriedly changed their tactics, avoided the vanguard of the Japanese army's counterattack, and used mobile tanks to advance in two routes, speeding south along the left and right sides of Wa City Avenue. By the 22nd, their tank troops had advanced to the vicinity of Biyo south of Tonggu. At this point, the enemy's air force once again launched a large-scale offensive to cover the mechanized troops advancing south towards Yangon. At the same time, parachute troops and a part of the Indian Ocean fleet began a general attack. By May 4, according to their radio broadcasts, a part of the troops had invaded Yangon City. But before this, the two sides had engaged in bloody battles near Peku, and the elite of the Japanese army made the enemy shed a lot of blood around Yangon. Moreover, the enemy's southward advance was too hurried, so from the north, through Taji, Pinya, and the area along the east-west line of Wa City Avenue in Tonggu, the enemy's rear was not only subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army retreating from the south bank of the Irrawaddy River, but even if the ambition to invade Yangon could be realized, it was indeed the original plan for the Japanese army to make the enemy shed a lot of blood. The enemy's losses were not small.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the Burmese front has close relations with Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and South China. In crushing the enemy's attempts to invade East Asia from the land, it has a major mission. Today, the Japanese army is ensuring the natural defense lines of the Sithang and Salween rivers, and intercepting the enemy, and will definitely give them a heavy blow.

<h3>Central Reserve Special Bank Notes To Be Used As Cash: Silver Industry Representatives Discuss Relieving Cash Panic</h3>

<h3>First Batch of Coal for Factory Relief Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Ministry of Industry Implements Coal-for-Electricity Exchange</h3>
<p>To provide coal for civilian use and alleviate the electricity shortage for factories in Shanghai, the Ministry of Industry established a Coal Mining Production Increase Supervision Committee in Nanjing to oversee coal mining and transportation. Its Shanghai office officially opened on July 1st at 266 Beijing Road, 5th floor. Mr. Jun, Director of the Ministry's Fisheries Administration, concurrently serves as the Director of the Shanghai office. A reporter recently interviewed Director Liu at the office, who stated: "As reported in newspapers on the 4th of this month, the first batch of coal transported to Shanghai by the Ministry of Industry has arrived. This coal is produced and transported by the Coal Mining Production Increase Supervision Committee itself, resulting in lower costs. If we transport coal to Shanghai with all our strength, it will amount to only about 1,000 tons per month. Calculating at an average exchange rate of 400 kilowatt-hours per ton, the total will be 400,000 kilowatt-hours, which is still a drop in the bucket. Therefore, Minister Chen of our Ministry recently ordered Vice Minister Wang, along with Director Tao Guojun of this committee, to come to Shanghai to purchase new ships. Preliminary agreements have been reached for two ships, and they should be available for use next month. Director Tao is also discussing transportation with trucking companies to increase capacity. If this plan does not encounter unexpected obstacles, the electricity problem for factories in Shanghai should be satisfactorily resolved, and the production industry in Shanghai will have good prospects."</p>

<h3>Director Xu of the Construction Bureau Answers Questions on Transportation, Water, and Electricity at Yesterday's Regular Press Conference</h3>
<p>The regular press conference organized by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held at the Municipal Government yesterday (7th) at 10:30 am. Director Xu of the Municipal Construction Bureau attended and answered questions from reporters from various newspapers regarding transportation, roads, and water and electricity issues in detail. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Construction of the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway</p>
<p>(Question) What is the progress of the construction of the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway? When will it be officially open to traffic?</p>
<p>(Answer) For the bridges on the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway, the contractor initially encountered difficulties in purchasing wood. The wood is now being supplied by the Highway Engineering Office of our Bureau, which has already sawn and matched the materials. The bridges on the Shanghai-Suzhou line should be completed by the beginning of August. Most of the road surface materials, such as crushed bricks and gravel, have also been transported by water to the construction site. They are now being transported along the line by military trucks. If the weather is good and there are no special changes, the entire line should be completed by mid-August.</p>
<p>Digging of Wells to Start Next Week</p>
<p>(Question) Shanghai has a large population, and the water source issue is extremely important. If there is a disruption to the water supply, the impact will be significant. We heard that your bureau is planning to dig wells. What are the specific plans? Has this project started yet?</p>
<p>(Answer) Our bureau has finalized the well project and signed a contract with the contractor. Work should begin next week. We plan to dig 20 wells. These wells are not rural wells and do not require the use of pumps. We will still use the old method, with wooden frames, pulleys, and two buckets. Although we are using the old method externally, the internal construction will be completely modern to ensure that the water source is exceptionally clean. The locations will also be convenient for most citizens to use.</p>
<p>Trolley and Public Horse-Drawn Carriage Issues</p>
<p>(Question) Currently, the trolleys operating in the city center all travel from west to east, while the No. 17 and 18 trackless trolleys that run from south to north have been suspended for a long time. Can your bureau find a way to promote their resumption to benefit the citizens?</p>
<p>(Answer) The No. 17 and 18 trackless trolleys have been suspended due to electricity restrictions, which has caused inconvenience to the citizens. We will do our best to contact the relevant authorities to resume operation as soon as possible to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>(Question) When will the public horse-drawn carriage service be realized?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding the public horse-drawn carriage service in this city, the representative of the initiators, Lu Zhaoyin, submitted a request on May 7th of this year to establish the service, along with sample carriage drawings, business plans, and route fare schedules. Our bureau believes that this is an innovative initiative that will benefit transportation, so we forwarded it to the Municipal Government for approval. We heard that the Municipal Government, for the sake of prudence, has ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to review the matter and report back. We will implement the plan after receiving instructions.</p>
<p>Water and Electricity Issues Under Discussion</p>
<p>(Question) What are the most pressing issues for Shanghai's infrastructure that your bureau is currently facing?</p>
<p>(Answer) The most pressing issues for the citizens of Shanghai are water and electricity. Our bureau is paying close attention to these issues. Regarding the water supply issue, Minister Chuan and Vice Minister Wang of the Ministry of Construction have come to Shanghai to discuss with relevant parties about increasing the supply. Our bureau has also had several consultations with relevant agencies and appears to have reached a satisfactory solution. We understand that the relevant agencies have agreed to increase the amount of coal allocated to the water and electricity companies, and it may soon be possible to restore the water consumption to the level of January of this year. Properties Managed by the Former Committee Can Be Returned Upon Proof</p>
<p>The former Municipal Government's Property Management Committee was ordered to be dissolved at the end of February this year, and its functions were merged into the Finance Bureau. The bureau has been working hard to reorganize and handle the remaining tasks. If citizens can provide conclusive proof of ownership of properties managed by the former committee and request the termination of management, the bureau will approve the return of the properties after careful verification. Recently, citizens Mei Songxian applied for the return of No. 2 Jinbo, Shujin Road, Nanshi; [Omission] Xiaoyan applied for the return of No. 221 Zhuhang Wharf, Nanshi; [Omission] Biao applied for the return of No. 225 Hongqiao Road and No. 1055 Yu [Omission] Road; [Omission] Ge applied for the return of No. 23 [Omission] Chuan Road; Huang Zengfu applied for the return of No. 2933 [Omission] Chuan Road; and Xu Qiujing applied for the return of No. 16 Fangxie Road. The Finance Bureau has verified that these properties are eligible for the termination of Yu Property Management and has reported this to the Municipal Government.</p>

It was decided that the tax will be implemented today. It is understood that all merchants will comply with the regulations and collect a tax of 2.5 per thousand from both buyers and sellers of gold. However, merchants who have not been designated and registered are prohibited from trading in gold to show restriction. The bureau has dispatched several secret investigators to investigate various merchants.

<h3>Watching the Famous Dance Drama "The Hunchback of Notre Dame"</h3>
<p>— Gao Yan</p>
<p>The famous romantic dance drama "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," sponsored by the Shanghai Music Association, has been performed at the [Omission] Xin Theater since Thursday of this week, with both daytime and nighttime performances until Monday, the 9th. This is the last dance drama performance of this year's music season. Those who love dance drama should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" - or "Notre Dame de Paris" - is an immortal masterpiece by the great French 19th-century Romantic Hugo. The story of this lengthy and complex literary work, like his other masterpiece "Les Misérables," has long been admired by lovers of literature. Even in Shanghai, the silent film era's Lon Chaney and the sound film's Charles Laughton have both played the lead role in this drama. The image of the hunchbacked Quasimodo is probably still deeply imprinted in the minds of many. As for the stage play, the performance was also quite good, but I won't go into detail here.</p>
<p>This time, the "Hunchback of Notre Dame" at the Lanxin Theater is a pure dance drama - Ballet, a mime woven from dance, music, and expression. It has no dialogue or singing, which is its characteristic feature. The performers are members of the Russian Ballet Troupe from the sea, and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra performs the music. The cooperation between skilled dance experts and a perfect musical troupe in performing a moving literary masterpiece will surely satisfy audiences artistically.</p>
<p>The entire play is in three acts and four scenes, with flawless sets and costumes. In the first act, the hunchback Quasimodo appears, and the beggars celebrate the Festival of Fools. The Gypsy girl Esmeralda and Captain Phoebus fall in love at first sight, and all the important characters of the play appear one after another. The second act is the highlight of the dance program. The lead actress, Esmeralda (played by Bobinina), and the lead actor, [Omission] Lujin (playing the captain), have both made profound achievements in dance. Their powerful application and beautiful performance have reached the level of perfection, winning continuous applause from the audience.</p>
<p>The third act is the climax of the entire play in terms of the story. When Esmeralda is hanged on the gallows, the priest Frollo is pushed off the [Omission] by Quasimodo and falls to the ground. Hugo's description of how the ugly man—as if a giant had been slaughtered, forever unable to tidy himself up—felt is truly heart-stirring. He muttered, "Ah, they are all those I love!" Of course, this dance mime did not perform it in this way, and the hunchback would not speak, but it used music and martial arts to stir up this wave in the hearts of the audience.</p>
<p>The sets are beautiful, and the costumes are gorgeous, all of the highest quality. The art director, [Omission] Yiren, the performance and dance director [Omission] Guan Ersiqi (who plays the priest Frollo in the play), and the music director [Omission] Ciji [Omission] Jun have contributed the most to the success of the play.</p>

In addition to hosting a simple banquet at the Yuhuangshan Branch that day to express my gratitude, with all expenses borne by myself, I will donate the total of 10,032,500 yuan from my relatives and friends to various charities to benefit the public.

<h3>The Decisive Stage—The Japanese Navy's Top Commanders</h3>
<p>As the war enters its decisive stage, the Japanese Navy's highest command has been selected and further strengthened, completing the most formidable lineup since the establishment of the Japanese Navy. According to a May 29th announcement by the Japanese Naval Ministry, Grand Admiral Koshirō Oikawa, the former Chief of the Naval General Staff, has been honorably appointed as a Military Councilor. He will be succeeded by Grand Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and Commander of the Maritime Escort Fleet. The vacancies for Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and Commander of the Maritime Escort Fleet will be filled by Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, the Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, who will be responsible for commanding all of the Navy's frontline forces. Furthermore, the vacancy for Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff will be filled by Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi, the commander of the naval air units at the non-island naval base. It is noted that Grand Admiral Toyoda, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, has been active at sea for a long time. His appointment as Chief of the Naval General Staff will allow his valuable frontline experience to be utilized in military planning, which will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the decisive battle on the home front. The new Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, and the new Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi, are both authorities on aviation. Vice Admiral Ōnishi has established great achievements in naval air tactics in the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines. As aerial combat becomes increasingly fierce, it is highly appropriate to entrust important positions to aviation warfare authorities with rich frontline experience. This also reveals the Japanese Navy's determination to overcome the difficult situation. The resumes of the newly appointed generals are briefly outlined below.</p>
<p>Grand Admiral Toyoda: A Military and Strategic Genius</p>
<p>The new Chief of the Naval General Staff, Grand Admiral Soemu Toyoda, is from the same hometown as Lieutenant Commander Hiroshi Hirose, Ōita Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1905 and continued his studies at the Naval Gunnery School and Naval War College. During World War I, he participated in expeditions to Qingdao and Siberia. In 1924, he transitioned from ship captain to a staff member in the Naval Affairs Bureau, and in 1925, he was promoted to Captain. In 1927, he served as commander of the 7th Submarine Squadron, teaching ingenious submarine tactics. He then served as the Chief of the First Section of the Education Bureau, focusing on naval administration. In 1930, he was appointed captain of the Hyūga, and the following year, he was promoted to Rear Admiral, serving as the Chief of the Second Department of the Naval General Staff. In September 1933, he became the Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet and the Chief of Staff of the First Fleet. In March 1935, he was transferred to the Director of the Education Bureau, and in November of the same year, he was promoted to Vice Admiral. At that time, he served as the Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau under Naval Minister Mineo Ōsumi and Vice Minister Isoroku Yamamoto, skillfully managing internal and external crises during the February 26 Incident and the Sino-Japanese War, which was highly praised at the time.</p>
<p>On December 10th, he was appointed as the Supreme Commander of the North China Naval Area, landing in Qingdao without bloodshed. Later, he established great military achievements during the landing in Hangzhou Bay. In November 1938, he returned to Japan and immediately assumed the position of Commander of the Second Fleet. In October of the following year, he returned to serve as the head of the Navy Technical Department. In September 1941, he was honorably promoted to Grand Admiral and appointed as the Commander of the Kure Naval District. During his two years in office, he dedicated himself to realizing independent military equipment plans, achieving significant results. In November 1942, he was appointed as a Military Councilor. In May of the following year, he was appointed as the Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District. Last March, he succeeded Fleet Admiral Mineichi Koga as the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet. This April, the Naval General Headquarters was established, and he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and Commander of the Maritime Escort Fleet, a position he held until recently.</p>
<p>Grand Admiral Oikawa: One of the Navy's Elder Statesmen</p>
<p>Grand Admiral Oikawa is from Okayama Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in December 1903 and steadily rose to the rank of Grand Admiral in 1939. During this time, he held important positions such as Chief of Staff of the Kure Naval District, Chief of the First Department of the Naval General Staff, Commander of the First Air Fleet, and Principal of the Naval Academy. In November 1935, he was appointed as the Commander of the Third Fleet. In December of the following year, he was transferred to the head of the Naval Aviation Department. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he has been the overall commander of the naval air force, diligently planning and working hard. In April 1938, he succeeded Admiral Hasegawa as the Commander of the China Area Fleet. In May 1940, he was appointed as the Commander of Yokosuka Naval District. In September of the same year, he became the Naval Minister in the Second Konoe Cabinet. In October of the following year, he was honorably transferred to the position of Military Councilor. In April 1942, he served as the chairman of the temporary grand festival of the Yasukuni Shrine. In November 1943, he assumed the position of the first Commander of the Maritime Escort Fleet. Last August, he succeeded Grand Admiral Shigetaro Shimada as the Chief of the Naval General Staff, a position he held until recently. Grand Admiral Oikawa assumed the position of Chief of the Naval General Staff amidst the major strategic situation following the loss of Saipan. During this period, he was able to exert his command effectively against the enemy's fierce counterattacks, inflicting significant damage and achieving great success.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Ozawa: A Famous Fleet Carrier Admiral</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, air power has become the main force in decisive battles. In three-dimensional naval warfare, the main force of the Navy is the mobile fleet based on aircraft carriers, and the "aircraft carrier" in coordination with base air power. Vice Admiral Ozawa is highly regarded for his command of this new aircraft carrier fleet. It can be said that no one in the Japanese Navy surpasses him. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War until he was transferred to the position of Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff last November, Vice Admiral Ozawa has been commanding warships on the frontline, worthy of being a famous general who has experienced many battles. Among the many talented Japanese naval officers, he has long been praised as a capable talent and is highly respected. Looking back at his career since graduating from the Naval Academy, it can be seen that he has either served as a commander on the frontline or held important positions in the center of operations.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Ozawa is from Miyazaki Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1909, along with Grand Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue and Vice Admirals Teruhisa Komatsu, Kakuji Kakuta, and Denji Ōkawachi. In 1921, he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and served as a staff officer in the First Torpedo Squadron. In 1929, he was appointed to the Naval General Staff. The following year, he was sent to Europe and America. Soon after, he was promoted to Captain and appointed as a destroyer squadron commander. In 1931, he served as an instructor at the Naval War College. He then served as an instructor at the Army War College (1932), captain of the Maya (1934), captain of the Haruna (1935), director of the Naval War College (1936, and promoted to Rear Admiral in the same year), Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet and Chief of Staff of the First Fleet, and squadron commander (1937). In 1938, he was appointed as the principal of the Naval Torpedo School. Later, he returned to serve as a squadron commander, and in 1940, he was promoted to Vice Admiral. In September of the following year, he was honorably appointed as the president of the Naval War College. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War in January 1942, he has been active on the frontline, establishing immortal achievements in numerous naval battles. After the naval air battle off the Philippines last November, he was transferred back to the center and appointed as the Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, a position he held until recently.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Ōnishi: Nurturer of the Kamikaze Warriors</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Ōnishi, following the late Fleet Admiral Yamamoto, who nurtured the Japanese naval air power, has commanded air operations and achieved many outstanding accomplishments. Moreover, he is also the great "nurturer" of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps warriors.</p>
<p>"Instead of being involved in personnel matters, I would rather serve on the battlefield." Vice Admiral Ōnishi once said earnestly. Therefore, in October of last year, when the aerial battle off Taiwan was in full swing, he was finally transferred abroad from the Director General of the Aeronautical Weapons Bureau of the Ministry of Munitions and honorably appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Naval Air Units in the Philippines. Since then, the naval battle off the Philippines and the Battle of Leyte Gulf have successively unfolded, and Vice Admiral Ōnishi has resolutely led the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps in the fierce air battles with the Americans, standing at the forefront and fighting bravely. It can be said that the Vice Admiral's achievements have created a new era in the history of Japanese aviation.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Ōnishi is from Hyogo Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1911. In 1924, he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. A year later, he was appointed as the flight commander of the Sasebo Naval Air Group. In 1928, he was appointed as the flight commander of the Ryūjō. In 1929, he was transferred to the Aviation Department of the Aviation Headquarters and promoted to Commander. In 1931, he was appointed as a staff member of the Education Bureau. In 1932, he was transferred to the Third Fleet as a staff officer. In 1933, he was appointed as the commander of the Sasebo Air Group and promoted to Captain. In 1934, he was appointed as the vice-commander and director of education of the Yokosuka Air Group. In 1936, he was appointed as the Director of the Education Department of the Aviation Headquarters. After 1939, he was promoted to Rear Admiral and successively served as commander of the air group and chief of staff of the fleet. In 1942, he was transferred to the Director General of the Aviation Headquarters. In May 1943, he was promoted to Vice Admiral. In November, he was appointed as the Director General of the Aeronautical Weapons Bureau of the Ministry of Munitions. Until October of last year, he took office as the Commander of the Naval Air Units in the Philippines until his recent appointment as Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff.</p>
<p>Looking at his experience, it can be seen that since 1915, his duties have always been related to aviation, and he has devoted himself to educating the brave soldiers of the Japanese naval air force. Today, the Japanese Navy is renewing its old outlook, putting all its efforts into completing a strong aviation fleet. At this time, bringing back Vice Admiral Ōnishi, a brave general with rich practical combat experience, to the center to take on important positions in the Naval General Staff will definitely adapt to the increasingly fierce situation of aerial decisive battles and further solidify the Japanese army like a rock.

<h3>Tentative Suggestions for Building a Common People's Village</h3>
<p>— Ma Huinong</p>
<p>In late October of the 31st year, the fire in the Jinjia Lane shantytown destroyed over 400 homes, resulting in over 2,400 deaths. On May 11th of this year, the fire in the Yuyao Road shantytown destroyed over 3,000 homes, extending to over ten factories and two alleyways, resulting in over 4,000 deaths. Looking at the damage from these two fires, the loss of both material resources and human lives, especially in these times of difficulty, not only drains the nation's strength but also brings unimaginable suffering to the livelihoods of the common people. The reasons for these two fires include the simple construction of the shantytowns, the lack of fire-fighting equipment and organizations, and society's neglect of the poor in the shantytowns. If caution is not exercised, it is difficult to extinguish the flames when they rage. The Jinjia Lane disaster area has already had a common people's village built by Buddhist organizations. The Yuyao Road disaster area is also actively being built by the same organizations. However, considering the painful lessons of the great fires, we should not only blame the past but also guard against future dangers. Now that the Yuyao Road common people's village is just starting construction, I would like to offer my humble opinions for the reference of the Municipal Government and those who are passionate about public welfare.</p>
<p>The number of common people in this city is very large, and the number of impoverished shantytown dwellers in areas such as Caojiadu, Xujiahui, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the South City is also significant. These impoverished shantytown dwellers make a living through manual labor, rickshaw pulling, and petty vending. They bear the most arduous production work, and they contribute a lot to the construction and prosperity of the city. Although their lives are like those of cattle and horses, they are the core strength of the city. They are the city's heroes. Before the war, the municipal authorities had improved the housing of these shantytown dwellers and built hundreds of common people's village houses on Zhongshan Road and elsewhere. However, due to the large number of common people—or impoverished people—these were not universally accessible, so shantytowns are still visible everywhere. Although the Yuyao Road common people's village is already under construction, for the sake of their lives and happiness, we should not simply provide indirect relief or change their housing situation and leave it at that. In addition to the problem of housing, education, culture, cleanliness, hygiene, medicine, fire protection, entertainment, etc., should all be given appropriate improvements.</p>
<p>Education: Most of the poor people and children in the shantytowns are illiterate. For the sake of national revival and the popularization of education, I hope that those who are enthusiastic about compulsory education will establish compulsory primary schools and literacy education in that area so that the poor children there can all have the opportunity to become literate. As for the teaching time, it can be arranged during their spare time.</p>
<p>Culture: The population in that area is large, so we should not only instill considerable knowledge but also establish a public reading room and a library. At the same time, enthusiastic people can regularly hold popular knowledge lectures in that area, such as on medicine, hygiene, and public security, all of which can enable them to make progress.</p>
<p>Cleanliness and hygiene: The poor do not pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, such as dumping garbage, defecating everywhere, blocking ditches, and cluttering their rooms with dirt. As a result, mosquitoes and flies breed. Regarding this, I hope that the authorities will set up more garbage bins and public toilets, and also conduct guidance on cleanliness and hygiene, so that the poor pay attention to public health. When necessary, cleanliness inspections should be carried out.</p>
<p>Medicine: There are many poor people who get sick because they neglect hygiene or are unable to seek medical treatment after getting sick. Especially because the poor are ignorant, they either deliberately delay treatment in the hope of recovering on their own or seek divine intervention to avoid disaster. Such phenomena should be paid attention to. Therefore, I hope that the city's charitable organizations will set up more free clinics and pharmacies and common people's clinics in that area, reducing fees as much as possible so that all patients can receive treatment. The Health Bureau should regularly conduct vaccinations and smallpox vaccinations in that area to prevent them from epidemics or infections.</p>
<p>Public activities: In the area where the poor live, because the population is large, their life activities should also be paid attention to. For events such as weddings and funerals, they also need to set up banquets for celebrations. Especially for funerals, they need a suitable place to provide for them. Therefore, in the common people's village, in the same place as hundreds of houses, five or six houses should be set aside as public halls, specifically for their weddings and funerals. In ordinary times, these houses can be used to provide the most basic entertainment equipment such as chess or gramophones or radios so that they can get appropriate adjustments. In addition, try to make use of some open spaces to plant flowers and trees, and even build a small sports field so that they have the opportunity to exercise.</p>
<p>Fire protection: More wells should be dug, and able-bodied men should be trained in fire-fighting and a fire brigade should be organized. If possible, the authorities should provide some fire extinguishers and water hoses in preparation for disasters.</p>
<p>Regarding the above points, I hope that the authorities will select the most important ones and implement them, and truly try to improve the lives of the poor. Charitable organizations and well-known public figures can also assist the local public security agencies to benefit the poor. Finally, several houses should be set aside in this area for public use, which can be used for education, as a ceremonial hall, or even for providing medicine and treatment. On the other hand, those responsible for public security work should not only regularly pay attention to the management of the common people's village, but also provide practical guidance on their lives.</p>
<p>We should not simply solve their housing problem, but should think about building a perfect common people's village. (Moved to support the charity school fund)</p>
<h3>Strengthening Summer Health Administration</h3>
<p>— Li Renzhong</p>
<p>Recently, the number of deaths among citizens has gradually increased. This is, of course, due to the summer heat and the ease with which diseases spread. If we want to ensure the health of citizens and avoid the invasion of cholera and other pathogens, we must strengthen health administration!</p>
<p>In recent years, health administration has mainly focused on compulsory vaccinations, with other aspects of health administration not yet addressed. Although this is due to a lack of economic resources, it seems that efforts could still be made in some areas. On the one hand, citizens are struggling to make a living and have no time to pay attention to health, which is an inevitable trend. However, during this summer season, if precautions are not taken, then once they fall ill, the cost of medicine will be difficult to bear, and the loss of life is also to be expected. I will outline the most important points below:</p>
<p>Water Use: Due to electricity restrictions, many citizens dig wells for drinking water to supplement the shortage. However, well water is definitely not as reliable as tap water. If a household uses contaminated clothing for washing and it contaminates the well, the speed of transmission will be rapid and will definitely lead to an epidemic. In 1942, cholera was rampant in the South City, with well water contamination being the biggest cause. Therefore, the discharge of sewage should be kept as smooth as possible. If it accumulates for a long time, it will definitely flow back into the wells, which will be even more harmful. In addition, accumulated water in air-raid shelters should also be properly disposed of.</p>
<p>Eliminating Filth and Garbage: The harm of garbage is well known. It harbors filth, breeds mosquitoes and flies, and is a breeding ground for pathogens. Therefore, we must do our best to remove it and prevent it from accumulating, which is extremely urgent. However, there are countless piles of garbage in the back alleys of the city, and in places like Pudong and the South City, some have accumulated for years without being cleared. It is thought that the health authorities have not had time to pay attention to this. The citizens are suffering greatly! Under the scorching sun, the stench is unbearable. When the breeze blows, it scatters everywhere. On rainy days, the filth flows everywhere with the water. This urgently needs to be improved.</p>
<p>Inspecting Fish, Meat, and Cold Drinks: Decayed fish and meat often contain toxins, which can cause illness. Street vendors' cold drinks should also be checked for cleanliness. If there are no covers and flies are accumulating, they should be ordered to improve.</p>
<p>Disinfection Should Be Added to Preventive Injections: Preventive injections are indeed a good intention and policy of the authorities. However, in some areas, injection technicians neglect the disinfection of injection equipment, and their indifferent attitude is even more appalling. As a result, those who are clean-minded regard injections as a harsh policy and avoid them in every possible way. Therefore, there are those who commit fraud with injection certificates, which is extremely detrimental to health administration!</p>
<p>Regarding Propaganda: Newspapers should publish special editions on disease prevention to increase citizens' knowledge of disease prevention, or post simple text and pictures to show the various harms of not paying attention to hygiene.</p>
<p>Strictly Punishing Those Who Violate Hygiene: For example, those who dump garbage on the streets or defecate in public places. In places like Pudong, there are even those who wash chamber pots in the river. Unless they are punished, it will not be enough to deter others from following suit.</p>
<p>Establishing More Epidemic Hospitals: If citizens suffer from epidemics and the poor cannot afford medical treatment, it not only endangers their lives but also poses a risk of infection. Therefore, it is essential to establish more epidemic hospitals and provide free treatment.</p>
<p>Suppressing Drug Prices: The authorities have repeatedly warned about suppressing drug prices, but the result is that those who speak earnestly are ignored. Ordinary citizens cannot afford to buy medicine, and merchants are unwilling to sell it without charging high profits due to the rising prices of everything. A stalemate has been formed that cannot be corrected. The health authorities should cooperate with the economic authorities to manage drugs, eliminate the black market, and take effective measures.</p>
<p>Although the above is old news, if we want to ensure health, the health authorities must devote themselves to these various efforts to be effective. Alas! The people are already suffering deeply, and how can they be burdened with unexpected disasters? It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Park Opening Hours</h3>
<p>— Floating Cloud</p>
<p>These past few days, the weather has suddenly become stifling, and the heat on the thermometer rises step by step along with the price index. Under the unbearable pressure of life, people are even more tormented by the scorching summer, and truly find it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>In this season of sweltering heat, the only good thing for our laboring class, besides working in sweat, seems to be the parks with their deep green shade! Especially in today's world where the cost of living is extremely high, ordinary wage-earning citizens cannot even secure food and clothing, let alone have the extra energy to seek entertainment. They work hard at their respective jobs from sunrise to sunset, and in the evening, they always want to take some time off to rest well. The Bund Park is a good place in their minds, because there is natural cool breeze, verdant trees, and a green beach. Leaning on the chairs by the river for a short time, casually looking at the small boats drifting with the waves, and listening to the sound of the waves and the rustling of the trees, makes people forget all the fatigue of the day, and they cannot help but feel refreshed and gain infinite pleasure. Especially on muggy summer nights, those living in pigeon-cage-like houses find the park to be their paradise.</p>
<p>Since July 1st of this year, the municipal authorities, in order to seek the welfare of the public, have adjusted the opening hours of the Bund Park to be from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily. The general public is delighted, but the reader believes that the above opening hours, which only last until 8:00 PM, seem too early. Most of the working class only have spare time around 7:00 PM after dinner to walk in the park to relieve their boredom. In fact, the park closes around 7:45 PM, so the only enjoyment of the citizens cannot be realized. Except for a few who turn to other aspects for entertainment, most of the depressed masses have a feeling of sighing at the closed gate. I secretly think that in this period of conserving electricity and controlling lights, the authorities have considerable reasons for limiting the opening hours of the park. However, to the extent possible, I sincerely hope that the municipal authorities can extend the opening to after 9:30 PM, so that the general public can get a little bit of the minimum life adjustment, which may also be of small benefit to the health and hygiene of the citizens!</p>

<h3>School Evacuation and Rescuing Out-of-School Students</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Now the summer vacation of various schools in this city is about to end, and schools at all levels have begun to enroll new students for the next semester. The remaining schools are probably also actively preparing. At a time when the current situation and price issues are very serious, the authorities of schools at all levels inevitably feel that it is difficult to cope with the various problems of the next semester's opening.</p>
<p>The suggestion of school evacuation has been circulating for a long time, and our newspaper's editorial has also repeatedly stated it. But so far, there has been no news of any planned implementation. This is not because the school authorities do not understand the advantages and disadvantages of evacuation, but because there are too many practical difficulties that need to be resolved first. Large and secondary schools with poor reputations are fundamentally insufficient to evacuate; otherwise, it will inevitably lead to consequences equivalent to dissolution. And schools with well-known reputations have many issues to consider if they want to evacuate: First, the number of students at the end of this semester has been considerably reduced compared to the time of enrollment. Most of these students have returned to their hometowns with their parents or evacuated to other places; therefore, most of the current old students have reasons why their parents are unable to leave Shanghai. If the parents can evacuate to the same location as their children, it must be an absolute minority. Second, the parents of wealthier students have doubts or distrust towards the security of the evacuation site. If they are still willing to send their children to school for their studies, it is feared that only a small number will do so. Conversely, if the schools where their children originally attended are evacuated, it is not difficult to find another school with slightly less ideal conditions to continue their studies. It is more convenient for children and parents to be in the same place for care, and at least they can get temporary peace of mind. Third, at a time when transportation is very difficult, if the school authorities want to move experimental instruments and application equipment to the evacuation site, it will not only cost a lot, but it will also be difficult to transport, package, and protect them along the way. Fourth, many of the current teachers in the schools also hold other jobs or teaching positions in other schools. They rely on the income from several places to maintain their family's livelihood. If they evacuate with one school, their income will inevitably decrease. Although the cost of living in the evacuation site is lower, they are still worried about the past skyrocketing prices. They may be able to cope with the situation when school starts, but the difficult situation will inevitably increase day by day. If there is a deficit, it will be even more difficult to remedy the situation due to unfamiliarity with both the people and the place.</p>
<p>In summary, school evacuation is best started with public schools. The reasons are very clear: First, public school tuition is lower and there are more students, and recently, there has been a trend of not being able to accommodate them all; therefore, there is no need to worry about insufficient students after evacuation. Second, public schools, whether national or municipal, can more easily obtain the assistance of local political and transportation agencies. Ensuring the security of the evacuation site to gain the trust of the general public, as well as the transportation and protection of instruments and equipment, cannot be done without the assistance of the relevant authorities. Third, public school teachers are entitled to the allocation of salary rice. After evacuation, they can entrust the government authorities in the evacuation site to allocate it on their behalf, and the teachers' lives can be more stable. Fourth, if public schools face economic problems after evacuation, they can still appeal to the Ministry of Education or the Education Bureau to plan and find solutions, such as organizing loans, as temporary relief. Once public schools are successfully evacuated, private schools can follow suit as needed.</p>
<p>The above is a discussion about the issue of school evacuation. However, before the population of this city is fully evacuated, in order to maintain the studies of the students staying in Shanghai, most schools are afraid that they will still start school in this city. However, due to the recent surge in special prices, all schools have the following difficulties: First, in order to take into account the livelihood of teachers and the burden of parents, it is very difficult to set the tuition standard. Second, the lives of citizens are threatened after the price increase, and the number of students dropping out of school will inevitably increase; therefore, the general schools staying in Shanghai are worried about insufficient students. Third, the soaring price of rice and the tightening of water and electricity restrictions make it impossible for schools to enroll boarding students. This point is enough to affect the studies of students from afar. Fourth, after the increase in tuition, the scholarships and grants of the schools are not enough to distribute. This point is enough to cause students from poor families to drop out of school.</p>
<p>The municipal authorities should make every effort to rescue the out-of-school students who are the main pillars of the future country. First, the fundamental solution is to stabilize prices and reduce the suffering of people's livelihood. Second, find ways to continue the distribution of necessities to faculty and staff. Third, set up more vocational schools. Fourth, the Education Bureau should closely supervise the progress of studies and the distribution of funds in each school, and should assist the schools in resolving obstacles in the process. If all these can be reasonably resolved, the number of out-of-school students can be reduced as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Map of Borneo and its Adjacent Areas</h3>
<p>Since the enemy's combined forces launched a fierce bombardment on the Balikpapan area of Borneo on the 15th of last month, it took half a month until the 1st of this month before they forcibly landed at the Supirikrak Pier near Balikpapan. Recently, they have also attempted to establish a major bridgehead in the coastal forest areas of Miri and Tarakan in northern Borneo. After days of valiant resistance by the Japanese garrison and naval and air forces, the enemy suffered heavy losses and their offensive was thwarted, making it impossible to advance.</p>

<h3>Uncle</h3>
<p>— Shen Yuan</p>
<p>The brilliant sunshine shone in front of my eyes, and the ivy on the eaves was decorated with glazed green leaves. The water in the stream was soft; the gentle breeze rippled the surface, and the blue sky reflected on the water was also shattered.</p>
<p>Turning the corner, my footsteps hesitated at the door of an old house. I was not reminded of nostalgia here. That feeling had been deeply buried in a pile of rubble and weeds nearby.</p>
<p>Walking through the hall, clear footsteps echoed on the square bricks, and the sparrows in front of the eaves flew away noisily.</p>
<p>In the corridor, I saw an old man bathing in the bright sunshine.</p>
<p>"Second Uncle," I blurted out.</p>
<p>"It's you, I didn't expect you to come." With surprise, the vague voice came out from the gaps of his toothless mouth. I felt that the voice was still kind.</p>
<p>After entering the house, Second Uncle casually covered the "Human World Poetry Talk." We looked at each other in silence. He seemed to have a lot to say at heart. I felt that he was very excited.</p>
<p>"How many years has it been since we last met?"</p>
<p>"Nine years," I had calculated it long ago. "It was the year when my grandmother passed away."</p>
<p>"Time flies so fast."</p>
<p>The person standing in front of Second Uncle was not only grown up, but also tall, which surprised him. He energetically put his thin hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Is it good for time to pass quickly, or is it good for it to pass slowly? ... How have you and your mother been these days ...? You haven't forgotten me, have you?"</p>
<p>"Uncle, we miss you very much."</p>
<p>The hypocritical words made my heart beat violently. "I can't help but comfort him." In fact, I was so busy dealing with the hardships of life, where could I spare a little bit of mind to pity others? Even if I occasionally remembered, it was only like the sunlight passing over the clouds.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>I looked at Second Uncle's appearance: a thin face, too many teeth had fallen out, so his cheeks had sunk in. His hair was half white. His eyes were already dull, but now there were a few traces of tears in his dry eye sockets, which seemed to have a little bit of light.</p>
<p>"Say something, Lin'er, you were so lively when you were a child."</p>
<p>Before I could dig out the accumulated memories, a thin woman flashed out of the house. She stepped forward very cautiously. Her dress and demeanor obviously did not belong to the younger generation, but she looked very young among the old people.</p>
<p>"This is my aunt."</p>
<p>"I haven't met my aunt yet." I bowed slightly, as if giving a salute.</p>
<p>My aunt was a capable person. She was good at dealing with people, and I didn't feel her affectation. Using the children's address, she called me "Brother Lin." She was busy asking me to sit down and handed me tea, and then she was busy arranging lunch herself. She asked her uncle for permission and said:</p>
<p>"I think we have to ask Wu Ma to buy a pound of carp."</p>
<p>"Lin'er," Second Uncle kindly called my name. "You think about it for me. People are still laughing at me, that I have to remarry at such an old age. Do you know my pain? ... Seven or eight children are not by my side, can they really bear to leave me? Besides, elder brother, they will have to get married in the future, can these things be taken care of by no one? ..."</p>
<p>A cat was sleeping on the black lacquered square table. It was dozing, as if thinking about something.</p>
<p>Everything was so quiet.</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered the relatives' comments on Second Uncle.</p>
<p>"... They can't control me, having children, that is also destined. ... I think I still haven't had enough of these torments."</p>
<p>So we talked about everything since we parted. The wandering life and the struggling of poverty, these words were endless. Old people strung them together with emotion. They had not experienced such pain and injustice in the long years.</p>
<p>It was almost noon. My aunt had probably arranged everything comfortably, held the child, and let him laugh, calling me "Brother Lin." The child, however, completely ignorant, burst into tears. Under the scolding of Second Uncle, who had achieved success in his career, she was busy carrying the child away. It turned out that Second Uncle was talking to me about how the harvest last year was particularly bad, the accumulated debts could not be paid off, and the tenants were withdrawing their leases. He was trapped in an unimaginable predicament. He also complained that his children did not understand him. In an excited mood, he unconsciously placed his hopes on me:</p>
<p>"Talking to you, I think you are still the most promising and understanding. You have to do well and not disappoint your mother and me."</p>
<p>A moment of sorrow swept across Second Uncle's face.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell him that if I really had a relationship with him, he would feel that I would never understand him.</p>
<p>A cool breeze blew into the courtyard. The moisture rose slowly in the sunlight, printing shadows on the windows and the roof tiles outside the windows. My heart. My heart was tinged with a heavy depression. What I saw out of the window was only a small patch of sky in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Second Uncle ordered the old woman, "Prepare lunch, and get some wine." Turning around, he said to me:</p>
<p>"Over the years, I have always been greedy for drinking. I can't care about what kind of wings are not weak, ... Lin'er, you have a drink with me today. I used to be against young people drinking. But ..."</p>
<p>So a picture floated leisurely in my memory: In the afternoon of summer, the heat disappeared, and I accompanied Second Uncle to drink in the clean courtyard, letting the cool evening breeze caress; occasionally looking up, there was a shadow of a bat passing over the dark sky, going to a dark corner - that kind of peaceful life.</p>
<p>The pigeon bells rang outside the window, and the clear sound was lingering in the depths of the blue sky.</p>
<p>So, I said to myself again, "Let my reverie be taken away."</p>
<h3>Where to Go?</h3>
<p>— Zhiyun</p>
<p>Where to go after graduation? I heard that the school will also be closed;</p>
<p>Most businesses are speculative, hoarding, and in this time when people cannot make a living, society simply does not want graduates.</p>
<p>Parents may be disappointed, disappointment comes with the graduation of their children, raising children is also useless!</p>
<p>I have secretly peeked at my parents' haggard faces several times.</p>
<p>I always try to comfort them, saying that this is only a temporary phenomenon.</p>
<p>I have also hit walls and been ridiculed several times,</p>
<p>Like a speedboat that has lost its direction, spinning in a circular dead lake.</p>
<p>How much precious time and opportunities have been wasted, and I am still thinking: "Where to go"?</p>
<p>However, "graduation is unemployment" I have always denied.</p>
<p>Even if the surroundings are a solid black iron ring,</p>
<p>I will always firmly open a road that I should take!</p>
<h3>Chicken Childhood Magazine</h3>
<p>— Wang Yun</p>
<p>Inside, that speckled chicken had been squatting for more than ten days. We were tired of sending it food, but it still didn't move. My brother crawled on the ground, grabbed its tail with his hands, opened his mouth, and looked inside to see if there were any chicks. The hen was very angry, and the feathers were even more terrifying. It tried to peck my brother's head, and my brother knocked on the edge of its nest, singing loudly:</p>
<p>"If you don't hand over the chicks tomorrow morning - I'll kill you!"</p>
<p>The hen half-raised her body to drive us away.</p>
<p>One morning, after school, I was playing with my classmates. My brother tripped Baldy Wu next door, and we triumphantly went home.</p>
<p>! The hen came out of the nest, and she happily led three chicks on their first parade in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Cluck! Cluck! ...</p>
<p>The hen's head advanced, one probe after another. The chicks followed closely behind, like three small velvet balls rolling: black, red-flowered, and white.</p>
<p>Cheep! Cheep! ...</p>
<p>"Only three chicks hatched from ten eggs!" Grandma sat on the threshold, regretting.</p>
<p>This gave us a lot of joyful information. Every day, we picked a handful of rice to feed them, watching the little beaks peck at the ground, thinking it was quite interesting.</p>
<p>The back garden was a flat green meadow, with several old willows bowing their waists and stretching their arms, with tender branches and green leaves thickly covering the sky. The old days in the sky were quiet, and the sunlight, passing through the holes, was neither cold nor warm. In the wind, it sent a burst of warmth, silence! The bird cherry trees were covered with small yellow flowers, and a group of bees hovered there, humming a little tune.</p>
<p>Cheep! - Cheep!</p>
<p>The chick snuggled against its mother, shrinking its neck, lying in the grass, scratching its beak with its claws, and quietly looking at the new world. When tired, a thin white film covered its little eyes.</p>
<p>Cheep! - Cheep!</p>
<p>The chicks grew up day by day!</p>
<p>One of the white chicks was missing. My brother and I were anxious to find it, but it was not there. A few days later, its body was pulled up from the well.</p>
<p>One windy night, the cat opened the chicken coop and snatched one away.</p>
<p>"Don't cry! We'll hatch more in the future." My father always comforted us wisely.</p>
<p>Suffering from chicken plague, the hen coughed for two days, and then died silently.</p>
<p>"It's missing its child!" My brother sadly thought of me, and I immediately felt that I was really sorry for the hen!</p>
<p>Only one was left! It walked around alone every day, stopping from time to time, tilting its head and listening, listening, ...</p>
<p>"Where is my mother? Where are my brothers?"</p>
<p>Cheep! - Cheep!</p>
<p>Wandering, calling out in disappointment.</p>
<p>One autumn evening, it was gone again! I had to search every corner of the house and woodpile. Nothing! Going to the back garden, my brother smacked his lips and called:</p>
<p>"Cluck! Cluck!"</p>
<p>No response. The rain was hitting the leaves, rustling.</p>
<p>Looking at a clump of long grass for a long time, I heard a faint cry, I climbed in and pulled it out, and my brother took a breath.</p>
<p>"Raising chickens that don't lay eggs, what are they for!" The little chicken's head began to grow a crown, and my grandma pouted.</p>
<p>But we secretly fed it handfuls of rice.</p>
<p>The crown grew higher, blood red.</p>
<p>Cluck! Cluck! -</p>
<p>I was buttoning my jacket: "Listen, the chick is crowing!"</p>
<p>My brother laughed happily.</p>
<p>The winter night was cold, and the moonlight cast the shadow of the west house into the courtyard, clearly dividing it into two halves. A star jumped on the crescent moon, a red eye.</p>
<p>Cluck, cluck - cluck! The chicken was crowing.</p>
<p>"Get up later! Isn't it hard?" My mother loved us.</p>
<p>But my brother happily said, "No! We sleep with our chicken and get up with it!"</p>
<p>It had really grown up too. Once, it pecked the head of the white chicken of the Da Wa family, causing it to bleed. Later, when it saw it, it ran away for its life. It followed the sugar seller's stick dancing, and the old man couldn't hit it no matter what. If people who came to my house offended it, they would get pecked. For this reason, the old woman next door cursed it every day: a vicious chicken!</p>
<p>"Kill it and sacrifice it during the New Year. Such a fierce chicken!" Grandma said.</p>
<p>"Try killing it!" My brother was unconvinced.</p>
<p>My mother sympathized with us and said, "It's better to be fierce! The old woman next door comes over every day, babbling about winter melons and red dates. At the end, she still asks your grandmother for something before she leaves. Here, she's coming again!"</p>
<p>When spring came, the rooster grew even taller, standing on one leg on the wall, and the breeze blew up the red-brown tail feathers. He cocked his head and crowed twice, full of vigor.</p>
<p>Cluck - cluck! Cluck - cluck!</p>
<p>Grandma walked over, followed by a burly man with a net in his hand.</p>
<p>I screamed in fear. I hurriedly waved my hands to drive it away:</p>
<p>"Go away!"</p>
<p>The man hurried up and slammed a net down.</p>
<p>Flapping, flapping, ...</p>
<p>It tilted its body, oh, it finally escaped! It flapped its wings and flew out the door.</p>
<p>The man followed closely, and I cried! I ran around shouting, and it flew to the roof of the old woman next door again.</p>
<p>Cluck-cluck! Cluck-cluck!</p>
<p>The rooster didn't crow often, but it was being chased like this, and I felt greatly insulted, and angrily cursed the man.</p>
<p>The man didn't look at me, he wiped the sweat from his head with his hands in a ruthless manner.</p>
<p>The old woman next door drove it down from the roof, and it flew in the air.</p>
<p>The man's net fell down!</p>
<p>Squawk! Squawk! ...</p>
<p>Struggling; then it was trapped in the net again. Struggling; the man pinched its neck with one hand and stuffed it into his chicken coop in a confused manner.</p>
<p>I cried in disappointment, ...</p>
<p>"Don't cry, all this money is for you"! Grandma put the silver coins in both hands in front of me.</p>
<p>I slapped it away, and the silver coins scattered all over the ground, rolling around.</p>
<p>"You have been wronged, child!"</p>
<p>Mother walked over with wet hands, took me away, I cried, and mother also shed tears.</p>
<p>When my brother found out, he lowered his head to find Grandma, but my mother grabbed him, and he cried angrily.</p>
<p>From then on, we lost that crowing rooster! ...</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Softball Game: Panda Team Unluckily Loses to Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>— (Bin)</p>
<p>Five to Six… A Difference of One Point</p>
<p>Baseball has become less popular in our country in recent years. As a long-time baseball fan, I learned from the newspaper about the public softball league in Shanghai, with our Chinese Panda team participating. So, on the fourth, I drove to watch the game. It was the Panda team versus the Japanese Residents team. Regarding the skills of these two teams and the game's progress, I offer my humble criticism below.</p>
<p>In this game, the Chinese team lost to the Japanese Residents team by a score of six to five, a difference of one point. Japanese citizens have always emphasized baseball, regarding it as one of their national sports. The Chinese team's defeat in this match was not without reason. In my opinion, the Chinese team lost due to a lack of composure. Additionally, their offense seemed too weak. Conversely, the Japanese team's players seemed slightly more experienced. Furthermore, their hitting was excellent, especially the shortstop Su Ruo and the catcher Miura. It was said that two key players from the Chinese team, Wang Qingrui and Wen Ruixiong, mistakenly missed the game. Catcher Wang Xiushan and coach Liang Fuchu stepped in, but it was to no avail. However, Mr. Liang is still a veteran. Despite his age, he remains agile, making several brilliant catches at first base. As for catcher Wang, his ball handling seemed rusty, likely due to a lack of practice.</p>
<p>Japanese Team's Hitting is Excellent, Chinese Team Lacks Composure</p>
<p>The game was quite tense. In the first two innings, the Chinese team lost two points due to misfields between second and third base. However, in my observation, these two points were lost due to the Japanese team's excellent hitting. For example, the first point was lost when Japanese player Inoshita hit a low, fast ball along the third base line, which was difficult to catch. Also, in the second inning, Su Ruo hit a parallel, fast ball that barely cleared the head. In baseball, these two types of hits almost always guarantee a safe hit, so it's no wonder the Panda team was helpless against them. However, what I want to comment on in this game is the Chinese team's lack of composure and uncharacteristic mistakes. For example, in the fifth inning, center fielder Wang Nianzi dropped a high fly ball hit by Ueshima, which allowed Miura to score and Ueshima to get a double. In the same inning, catcher Wang Xiushan mistakenly believed the Japanese team had two outs. When Iwatate stole second base, he hastily threw to second baseman Wen Tianhua, allowing Ueshima, who was at third, to advance home. Whether Wang's throw was due to a misunderstanding is unknown. Perhaps Wang had devised a clever plan to lure Ueshima off base, with Wen Tianhua then throwing home for the catcher to make the play. But regardless, Wang's throw was due to a lack of composure and caution.</p>
<p>With Careful Offense, Victory Could Be Turned Around</p>
<p>As for the Panda team's hitting, I have not attended their previous games. But in this game, I felt that the players' hitting skills were not yet perfect. In the fourth inning, coach Liang Fuchu hit a brilliant shot, allowing Zhong Baoluo and Li Qizheng, who were on second and third base, to score. Mr. Liang is, after all, a baseball veteran. If it weren't for his hit, those two points probably wouldn't have been scored. Most unfortunately, in the last inning, if the Chinese team's players had been more composed and hit aggressively, they still had a chance of winning. At this time, they were only behind by one point, and they had two runners on second and third. All they needed was a hit to tie the game or even turn the defeat into victory. Unfortunately, Liang Youwen and Liang Youyi both used short swings, and their high fly balls were easily caught by catcher Miura, thus sealing the defeat.</p>
<p>Describing the Japanese Team's Excellence for the Chinese Team's Reference</p>
<p>Finally, based on my personal observations, I will briefly describe the strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese Residents team for the Panda team's reference when they play again in the second round. I carefully observed the batting order of the Japanese Residents team, placing good hitters first, such as Nogami, Inoshita, Iwahana, Su Ruo, Miura, etc., with the weaker hitters batting last. Therefore, the Japanese team's chances of winning are usually in the first three or four innings. If the Chinese team can defend carefully during these innings and prevent these players from getting on base and scoring, it is doubtful whether the Japanese team can win later. As for the Japanese Residents' defense, the area between second and third base is their best. Their outfielders are mediocre and appear flustered when catching the ball. Catcher Miura's throws are very fast, so stealing should not be attempted lightly. As for pitcher Ueshima, he has a rather impatient temper. If he loses several points in a row, he will become flustered and throw wild pitches. However, his left arm is very powerful, so be careful when catching his high fly balls.</p>
<p>Panda Team to Play Portuguese Merchants Tomorrow</p>
<p>I heard that tomorrow (the 8th) at 10:30 AM, the Chinese Panda team will play the Portuguese Merchants at the Russian Athletic Association field on Avenue Joffre (Nanjing West Road) and Rue Cardinal Mercier (Maoming Road). The Portuguese team was last year's league champion, and players like "Home Run" specialists Tangbala, Mashaner, Oliveira, etc., are all top players. Whether the Chinese team can win the championship in the league will depend on their victory over the Portuguese Merchants. Also, on the 12th (Thursday) at 4:30 PM, the Panda team will play the Pirates. Although the Pirates' skills are mediocre, the Chinese team should not be overconfident to avoid an upset.</p>
<h3>Charity Tennis Tournament by China Real Estate Association to be Held Next Weekend</h3>
<p>The China Real Estate Association's charity tennis tournament was previously reported. According to this week's information, the association has been actively preparing for the event, and the date has been set for next weekend. To make the event more grand, Mr. Lin Kanghou has been invited to officiate the opening ceremony, and female stars will be invited to present the awards. The grandeur of the occasion is certainly to be expected. Amid the cold atmosphere of tennis this summer, this is naturally a tennis match that is particularly appealing.</p>
<p>I spoke with Mr. Ma Runfang, the person in charge of the association. All expenses for the charity tournament will be borne by the association, and all proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to the scholarship funds of Shen Bao and Sin Wan Bao newspapers. The association's goal is to promote tennis and help underprivileged students through this opportunity.</p>
<p>This competition should be considered the only tennis match this year. For tennis fans, it is the only opportunity to enjoy tennis. I sincerely hope you don't miss this chance. Ticket prices are divided into two types: 50,000 yuan (honor tickets) and 20,000 yuan (regular tickets). The honor tickets have already been entrusted to various parties for sale and are sold out.</p>
<p>The participating players and their order are currently being arranged by the authorities. As far as I know, Wang Wenzheng, Tao Guanqiu, Zhang Dingjian, Zhou Guanjun, Li Leishi, etc., will all be playing. In fact, are there any other stars on the Shanghai tennis scene besides these? The most anticipated match is, of course, Wang Wenzheng versus Tao Guanqiu. They have never officially faced each other before. This time, it is internally decided that the two must compete for the upper hand. This is truly a feast for our eyes. Who wouldn't want to see this exciting singles match to determine the champion?</p>
<p>The association will host a reception for the sports and news media at 3:00 PM today. They will give us the greatest introduction and explanation at this tea party.</p>
<h3>Yang's Basketball Invitational Tournament Enlivens Summer Scenery</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Shu-ting, the general manager of Wing On Bank, has always been a promoter of basketball. Recently, Mr. Yang, in view of the lack of basketball courts in Shanghai, which has made the sport less popular than before, has held an invitational tournament, inviting six strong Shanghai basketball teams to compete at the Yang family basketball court on Dahua Road. Although basketball is not a summer sport, it is a good opportunity to stretch one's muscles and bones. In other words, it is a good opportunity to enliven the summer scenery, which is worth mentioning. According to reporters, Mr. Yang is holding this invitational tournament to focus on interest and improving the level of play. Therefore, the competition will not have a championship trophy. In the future, after a championship team is selected from the six teams, the other five teams will host a banquet for the championship team for the purpose of socializing. The so-called six strong teams are introduced below:</p>
<p>Ren Yu Team</p>
<p>The Ren Yu team has a long history in Shanghai. It was previously managed by Mr. Tan Xingbo. I understand that Mr. Tan has left Shanghai. However, before leaving, Mr. Tan entrusted Mr. Chen Wei-yuan to take over. Mr. Chen, under great trust, has invited Mr. Hu Ganbo as the team leader, Yan Yicheng as the manager, Wang Bingnan as the coach, and veteran Yu Yuzhi as the captain. Players include Li Luohe, Lin Weiting, Chen Weiyuan, Wang Huaishu, Yao Wenyi, He Wende, Shen Juming, Wang Chuqing, etc. Lin Huicong's return to his former team and the addition of new player He Lide have strengthened the team's strength. In terms of level of play, the team is determined to improve.</p>
<p>Red Team</p>
<p>The Red team is mostly the elite of the Yang's team. Players such as Lu Zhong'en, Xu Wenkui, and Yang Yuanlong have long been known. The team often practices at the court, so their home-field advantage is self-evident. We should wait and see their special achievements.</p>
<p>Blue Team</p>
<p>The Blue team is the second team of the Yang's team. Strong players such as Wei Dangsun are also good players in the basketball world. In addition, with the Yang's team's guidance, the young team is sure to put on an outstanding show.</p>
<p>Hua Nan</p>
<p>The Liu family generals of Hua Nan once caused a sensation. Then, due to the dispersion of its strong players, it disbanded virtually. Commentators have expressed endless regret for this promising new army. With He Jingui's return to Shanghai and Li Ruixiong's return again, the Hua Nan team will be in the hands of Liu family generals, and it should not lose its past glory.</p>
<p>Zhen Yuan</p>
<p>Although the Zhen Yuan team is the leader of the second teams, their skills have improved day by day under the guidance of Shanghai racecourse horse trainer Ma Xizhi, which is impressive. In addition, with Tian Lie's command, they complement each other. Therefore, in this invitational tournament, there will be a wild-card team, and the team itself will not underestimate its worth.</p>
<p>You Lu</p>
<p>The You Lu team is the overall champion of the second team basketball league this year, and its performance is naturally outstanding. The team's coach is former Shanghai Western team giant Kajie Mi Luofu. Mr. Kajie is not only intelligent and resourceful, but also has skills above the average level. This time, in order to raise the You Lu team to the first rank, he will personally assist the team. With Mr. Kajie's skills and the young players’ joint performance, its sophistication is far beyond our expectations.</p>
<p>In summary, Mr. Yang Shu-ting is holding this invitational tournament because the six teams are the most balanced in terms of interest and strength, which is expected to yield unexpected results. Basketball fans will flock to Dahua Road at that time. And it will be the basis for raising the level of play in the next tournament, without a doubt.</p>
<h3>Talking About Badminton (3)</h3>
<p>— Lian</p>
<p>Digestive Organs</p>
<p>In his book "Family Medicine," Zi Sheng-bai said, "All people should exercise. If they do not exercise, their muscles and blood circulation will be hindered, their stomach will become unhealthy, and various digestive diseases will arise. Therefore, exercise and digestion are mutually complementary." This kind of badminton exercise is very beneficial for the digestive system. For example, saving a low ball in front requires bending the body forward, putting pressure on the abdomen. When hitting a high ball coming from behind, the upper body leans back as much as possible. The abdominal muscles stretch, affecting the stomach and intestines, causing them to undergo rapid exercise, which strengthens the stomach and intestines. With good digestion, diseases such as chronic gastritis and chronic stomach problems will not occur. Many women in our country suffer from stomach problems, so they should do badminton exercise urgently.</p>
<p>Mental and Cheerful</p>
<p>When exercising various ball sports, one can forget all worries, sorrows, and pain, leaving not a trace in the mind. However, if one has deep troubles and goes to do slow games, the troubles will still linger in the mind, unable to be eliminated. Only by playing fast and urgent ball games can one forget everything. Because the brain nerves have to deal with the oncoming ball quickly, they cannot think about troubles.</p>
<p>The Origin of Badminton</p>
<p>Badminton is a very interesting game, a very beneficial game, and a very easy to learn game. This game does not require years of practice like tennis, yet it has the same benefits and the same interest. Therefore, no one dislikes this sport.</p>
<p>Badminton is a common saying in India. This sport originated in places such as Kolkata and Mantell in India. Taking a shuttlecock-like ball and using two wooden boards, people would play this game in any open space or at home. At first, the people who played were probably children. Later, the British saw that this game had a lot of value, so they improved the shuttlecock-like ball. The center of gravity and the weight of the ball were scientifically studied, and it became the badminton ball commonly used today. In fact, because this ball is a competitive game, the purpose is to shoot at each other. The ball is hit back and forth. The distinction between victory and defeat is also for this ball. Therefore, the English call this ball Shutretock. The British in London and Americans who love sports followed suit. The French also liked new sports. So the game of badminton became popular all over the world.</p>
<p>Badminton Construction</p>
<p>Badminton is divided into two parts: the ball and the feather. The ball is made of softwood into a semi-circular ball shape, called the ball surface. The diameter of the ball surface is one inch, connecting to a one and a quarter inch long cylindrical shape, called the ball body. The ball surface is covered with fine wool. White feathers are inserted on the ball body. The weight of the ball surface and the ball body is about nine cents. Too light is not suitable. Too heavy, the ball comes very fast, and is not suitable for beginners, and it is also expensive.</p>
<p>The feather part uses light white chicken feathers or white pigeon feathers. The length of the feathers is two and a half inches, the feather stem is one inch, and the feather is one and a half inches. The feather stem is inserted into the ball body about half an inch. The tip of the feather should be trimmed. The feather should be immersed in glue and glued. The feather stem is bound with thread. The weight of the feather is about five cents.</p>
<p>The weight of the entire badminton ball is 73 grams to 85 grams. It is about one coin and four points. The most suitable. The newly released rubber ball body is not suitable for beginners because the ball flies very fast.</p>
<p>Badminton Court</p>
<p>Although the form of the badminton court is similar to that of the tennis court, they are actually very different. The size of the tennis court is fixed and cannot be changed. Too large or too small is illegal. However, the badminton court can be adapted to local conditions and can be stretched or shrunk in size. This is the convenience of badminton. However, the form of marking the boundary line is slightly more complicated than the boundary line of the tennis court. The most common court is 44 feet long and 20 feet wide.</p>
<p>Net</p>
<p>The net should be made of fine and strong thread, woven into a one-inch square mesh, so that the badminton ball cannot pass through the mesh. The net is about three feet high, and the net is about 22 feet long, with a maximum of 25 feet. Unlike the tennis net, which is cut close to the ground, the badminton net should be placed high on two posts, five feet from the ground vertically downwards from the top edge. It should not be too high or too low.</p>
<p>Net Posts</p>
<p>Use a 3-inch diameter round solid wood post, insert it into the ground, about two or three feet or more. The total length of the post is about 6 feet.</p>
<p>The posts are divided into two types: fixed and movable. The movable posts should use iron tips to make the post feet and insert them deeply into the mud. Fixed posts should be buried in the mud to ensure stability. However, the net posts should not be too far from the side line to avoid misunderstandings when playing.</p>
<p>Racket</p>
<p>The racket was originally called Battledore and is commonly called Bahninton Tacket badminton racket, because the indigenous people of India used two wooden boards to play. The author personally saw it once in India in 1925. Now the racket is made of strings, similar to a tennis racket. However, the badminton racket is very thin and light, and is not as heavy as a tennis racket.</p>
