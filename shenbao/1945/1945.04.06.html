<h3>冲繩島北谷南方日守軍展開邀擊　以肉搏戰法予敵以重創</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　於冲繩本島西海岸目北谷方面南下中之敵軍，至四日正午許，已達到北谷南方三公里之大山，敵軍於戰車五輛之掩護下，又企圖攻擊大山東南方高地，斯時日守軍當即與之邀擊，結果燒毀其戰軍四輛，而將敵擊退。另一敵軍因急欲使用北及中兩飛機塲，故其中雖有尙未修理完竣之部分，然似已開始使用。</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　沖繩本島之美軍，三日正午向泡瀨推進，將本島南北切斷，刻下美軍已由泡瀨沿岸南下，是日下午三時許，擁有M4型戰車三十輛之敵軍約四百名，進抵久塲（泡瀨南方約五公里）。又北谷方面之敵軍與此相呼應，於三日夕以擁有M4型戰車十輛之一部隊進攻普天間，另一擁有戰車二三輛之小隊進至喜友名，日守備部隊刻於各處邀擊敵軍中，三日夜，曾實行果敢之肉搏戰法，使葡受創甚重。又四日晨擁有戰車約五十輛，迫擊砲多數之敵軍四大隊，於砲兵之掩護下，來襲野高及宜野灣北方地區，該地日軍部隊即起迎擊，目下展開激戰。四日晨敵軍進攻綫，自伊佐題喜友名，普天間，安谷屋以迄久塲一帶，與三日傍晚之戰局無大變化。攻擊冲繩本島周邊敵船之日航空部隊，依然繼續奮戰，三日晨至四日拂曉，業獲戰果如次：三日上午五時五十分至六時之間，望見本島方面海上有大火柱二條，上午一時二十分許，湊川南方海面亦有大火柱二條。四日上午二時，湊川南方燒毀敵輸送船一艘，五時十分，本島西方　　亦發生大火柱。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日軍地上部隊，刻正對冲繩本島登陸之敵軍加以痛擊，島內各處亦繼績展關英勇之反擊戰，予敵以吳大打擊。日軍防空部隊反水上部隊，爲呼應地上部隊之作戰，相繼出擊，反覆對敵艦船集團猛烈攻擊，漸擴大戰果中，四日業經大本營發表，但此僅係二日拂曉迄三日簿暮間之戰果，查二日晨五時四十五分至六時之間，陸軍特攻隊一隊，特猛炸冲繩本島西方海上之敵艦船，轟沉敵巡洋艦二艘，大型運輸船五艘，擊毀驅逐艦一艘，　於六時陸軍特攻隊之一隊，於冲繩中間海面擊沉其大型運輸船一艘，午後七時，陸軍特攻隊一隊，更猛攻慶良間列島附近之敵艦船，擊沉其戰艦一艘，擊沉巡洋艦二艘，同時並使其艦型不明者一艘起火燃燒。根據此項戰果，可知冲繩近海之敵艦船已受重大損書，綜合前後戰果，計轟炸艦船一百另七艘（內有空母四艘），擊沉或擊毀四艘，擊毀七十九艘（內有空母三艘），總計達百九十餘艘之多。</p>
<h3>冲繩島戰事慘烈長期化　島部長談太平洋戰局</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部常會於昨日下午舉行，到松島部長，松本大尉及各報記者多人，由松島部長闡述太平洋戰局及敵美受損慘軍情形。茲誌演詞概要如左：</p>
<p>敵方艦艇損失慘重</p>
<p>日美兩軍以冲繩島爲中心，戰事漸形激烈，敵軍一部已在本島登陸。自三月十七日美軍機動部隊對九州四國空襲開始，而至美軍在本島登陸，為期已有半個月，據敵方宣稱，在作戰第一綫活動之艦船，共一千四百艘，其中包括戰艦，航空母艦，運輸船，及上陸用舟艇等。日軍對此方面之敵軍，利用航空部隊水上部隊及特別攻擊隊等，予以猛擊，截至四月三日止，以上，此項艦船均係敵人在第一綫上所用者，經日車猛擊，結果其重要艦船，大半已這擊滅，因之敵方換失，非常嚴重。三月十七十八兩日，向九州南方來襲之敵軍，遭擊遁逃，狼狽之至。但敵人仍不顧一切，勉强作戰。美軍損失之重大，又可從其戰時動員局長彭士辭職一擧中覘之。在此決戰階段，負如此重任之局長，竟出於辭職者，實因彭氏感於笑軍人的資源方面受損太人故耳。</p>
<p>日軍利用新的戰法</p>
<p>敵人在那　北部登陸後，由東推進，通過狹隘地峽，加以切斷，但此舉實無重大意義，因那霸全區不過三百二十五平方公里，長六十哩，闊度平均入哩，地形狹長。日軍無論在海上在陸上，均大胆作戰，勇猛非常，此戰方在開端，已使敵人受如是重大之損害，敵人方面其作戰方式，一如過去航空部隊與海上部隊協同作戰，利用艦砲射擊，掩護坦克登陸，日軍方面則利用新的戰法，以應付來攻之敵人，予以重創。</p>
<p>日本軍民奮勇抗敵</p>
<p>敵人今後作戰，困難重重，據敵方水陸兩用部隊總指揮太那將軍稱，無論在補給或交通上，均有困難，故表示今後作戰，實至不易云云。總之，冲繩島非過去之硫黃島可比，在今後作戰上極猛烈之砲火下，草原變爲廢墟，而其山岳地帶之冲繩島信民，則與日皇軍協力奮戰，即婦人部隊亦參加突擊戰，軍民一致奮勇抗敵。關於此種情況，敵人於其報道中已明白披露矣。又敵人在此次作戰中，以陸軍中將伯納充任軍政班長官，對妨害美軍之民衆，予以嚴格處份，美軍對當地住民之壓迫如此，當地住民之態度如何、不言可喩。</p>
<p>美國反對英艦參加</p>
<p>此次英國艦隊參加太平洋作戰，此舉本在我人預料之中，且覺其實現太晚。英國艦隊之參加作戰，並非表現戰力之增强，實反映美國海軍武力及人力方面受損重大之更明顯的表示。美國對英國海軍參加太平洋作戰，一向表示反對，一由於數量之優越感，二爲戰後之政治問題，美國乃極力反對英國參戰，今冲繩島戰役中竟有英國海軍參加，可見美人亦出於萬不得已耳。</p>
<p>今後日軍作戰利用航空部隊及水上陸上部隊，更信能徹底擊滅敵人，建立光輝之勝利。又根據冲繩島在作戰上地位之重耍着想，定將化爲長期戰，而發生慘烈之結果也。</p>
<p>虛偽宣傳敵方慣技</p>
<p>最後關於宣傳方面，松島部長報吿兩點如次：　敵人方面之報道宣傳，有其一貫之慣技，過去對於其自身損害數字，發表時所披露者總在十分之一以下，對於日方之損害數字，則增加至十倍以上，如四月一日渝方廣播美機襲滬之結果，謂對上海空襲擊損日機九十餘架云云，其虛偽可知。　敵人在馬尼刺最近發動謀略宣傳，尤其對日本之將校階級，但日本之國民精神，絕對與英美不同，敵人之宣傳，結果乃爲徒勞無益之舉動。</p>
<h3>水上特攻隊　突擊敵艦船</h3>
<p>西南基地五日中央社電　日軍水上特攻隊，三日深夜於冲繩東方海上對敵艦船羣加以捨身突擊。至現在業判明炸毀敵驅逐艦一艘。</p>
<h3>德宣布組織「半狼人隊」　爭取自由解放</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　在一日復活祭時，國社黨執行本部長波爾曼氏，對全國黨員發出非勝即亡之布吿，並發表自敵軍佔領地之半狼人隊組織後，德意志民族之烽火，一燃而熾，非勝即亡之布吿，　請全國黨員捨身奉公，半狼人隊組織之形成，乃以自由解放爲目標之民族決戰，實乃第二次世界大戰史上，値得重大宣傳者也。</p>
<h3>德軍在西線　抵抗力增强　美軍在兩區獲進展</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社訊，德軍事發言人稱：戴至星期三午間爲止，西綫未發生驚人戰事，德軍之抵抗已加强，美軍僅在二戰區獲鉅大進展，　美坦克車隊向畢萊腓爾德出發，向北推進已抵巴德奧霍森。　在林根之美軍先鋒隊，已渡蘇爾河向塞拉梅里斯方面推進，向巴德奧霍森推進之目標，顯為威斯法里加，可切斷威塞堡蘭山而入德國北部平原。該路反軸心軍之側翼屢受威脅，損失坦克車甚多，在林根區德軍抵抗已加强，哥塞之美坦克軍及滑翔機被毀者甚多。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　德國社訊，德軍現已奪回距胡斯堡東南十六公里之奧克森福特，故德軍於各戰區增加抵抗力之說，頃已證實。</p>
<h3>德軍發表　東綫戰報</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　德國社訊：德軍戰報稱，東錢南段蘇軍，續向德拉夫門及拉布河上游之間施壓力，維也納之南德軍苦戰，截擊經由巴登而前進之蘇軍，紐西得爾湖與多瑙河之間及普萊斯堡防禦綫之蘇軍攻擊，於初步進展後，即被遇阻。上西里西亞之蘇軍，再圖在布累斯勞與雅根道夫間突破，遭德軍所阻，蘇軍繼續向布累斯勞要塞攻擊，但突入西段之蘇軍，已於猛戰後被封沒。但澤灣西岸德軍，苦戰抗拒蘇軍之不斷猛攻。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社訊，由洪境進攻維也納與普累斯堡之蘇軍兩隊在推進中，中斯洛伐克之戰綫，過於向東突出，爲適應戰略計，自動後移，並未受蘇軍之壓迫。</p>
<h3>簡訊</h3>
<p>南京電　建骰部與有關方面，擬定修築京鎭公路全部工程計劃，現開始初步工程，修築櫻橋及石馬橋兩橋樑。</p>
<p>南京電　鄕村建設協會擴大召集會員，大致就緒，定八日舉行成立大會。</p>
<p>南京電　華北政務委員長王蔭泰，在京公畢，四日北返。</p>
<p>北平電　實物納賦制度，本年即將於華北各地實施，辦法及數量，業經決定。</p>
<p>廣東電　據四日重慶廣播稱，渝方業任董霖爲駐荷大使。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>取締投機與導引游資並進</h3>
<p>昨論投機與游資，指出目前上海所有的龐大游費，未能導引使作正常的投資，而趨向於暴利的投機。因此，我們主取締投機與導引游資兼程並進。爰再加以申論如次：</p>
<p>市塲之混亂，以游資之猖狂作祟爲主因，固無待說，而且，由於游資投機可獲暴利，於是持有資金者，都不再作正當工商事業打算，人人向投機之途狂奔，一方面市塲愈陷混亂，另一方面投機家所獲的暴利，完全是從「大魚吃小魚」的瞬息過程中搶奪起來的，因此市塲的波動愈劇，則失利而顚仆之小魚亦愈多而慘，影響所及，正當工商業都作投機而圖徼倖。同時大投機家——也就是擁有龐大遊資者，爲造成其投機優勢，輒以製造與散佈謠言爲手段。因此，如果不對游資問題迅謀妥善對策，則雖日言嚴禁流言蜚語，取締敵方謀略活動，而實際上必然野火燒不盡，春風吹又生的。</p>
<p>上面說過，游資作惡之愈演愈烈，實由於過去當局雖言嚴禁投機而實際上未以極刑懇處攪亂市塲之投機者所致。據我們所知，現在當局對於擾亂市塲的投機份子，已經加以密切偵查，一旦查有實據，必將處以應得罪刑，自然無可逃避，我們希望一般市民切實檢舉，協助常局撲滅亂萌。我們相信，如能殺了若干大魚，小魚就可以望風歛跡了！</p>
<p>當然，取締投機是平靜市塲的治標辦法，而同時，對於澈底的治木辦法，就是導引游資使作正常投資，自屬絕對必要。否則，如目前的混亂市塲，縱能一時平靜，仍有死灰復燃的可能。第一，從游資所以作祟的原因加以研究，採取防止通貨非自然膨脹的有效措置，以安定金融，也就是根本安定人心，因爲，毫無疑問的，一般人民設法保持其所有幣値的心理，也是助長游資作惡及投機的主要因素。第二，必須善導游資，勿再集中於上海一隅，使之流向農村。誠然，游資內流，自須先有通盤和周密的計劃，務使資金流到每一個生產農民之手，而不是流到變相的高利貸者之手變成壓榨農民血汗的工具。所以，我們主張上海應以金融界爲中心，應速籌議組織農村貸款銀團，先向江蘇產米區作農業貸款。關於這一點，過去交通銀行的農貸處辦有相當成效，可以參攷其辦理經騐，而規定周詳辦法。第三，我們索來主張工農增產，可是，時至今日，增產已經脫了一節，實際上應如何急速防制減產和停工了。常局在嚴厲取締投機之後，還必須指示資金持有者一條出路，除農貸之外，還須保陣其向工鑛及正當商業貿易方面的投資，一方面如何改善運輸，增運煤斤，恢復供電，以挽救上海產業界；另一方面如何澈底改革證券交易市塲，使成爲眞正誘導游資向生產方面發展。不過，目前上海工業的環境，未易恢復舊時規模，與其株守，不如向內地謀求出路，况且，上海的日用品工業，大都銷售於內地農村，爲就近銷售計，更宜乘機遷地，在經營上亦爲上策。</p>

<h3>緬北戰况</h3>
<p>渝美軍折兵損將</p>
<p>渝方特重的衛立煌麾下雲南遠征軍十六師，在美方開通萊多公路的香餌之下，由美軍督戰，自去年五月對怒江正面開始總反攻以來，突破中緬邊境畹町等地，與日軍淸銳激戰約十個月，由於日軍的「出血戰術」，消耗殆盡，目下正集結其兵力於畹町以北，努力恢復戰力。於此期間，據日軍俘虜的渝軍哨兵供稱，雲南遠征軍傷亡實達十五萬之多。按雲南遠征軍來攻當初第一綫兵力約六十萬，但自去年五月第二次怒江作戰開始以來，迄今已折損十五萬，爲重整陣容，曾先後補充九萬餘人，唯多係未受充分訓練的烏合之衆，究非日軍之敵，因受日軍攻擊，損失殊大，鬥志亦低。又據美方發表，建築萊多公路。困難重重。按萊多公路自印度至中國，全長一千四十四哩，沿路每哩都有美軍將士墓。協力建設此路之美國兵力，達一萬五千名以上，其百分之六十五（九千七百五十名以上）是黑種人。</p>
<p>日利用黑夜創敵</p>
<p>隨硫黃島·呂宋島方面戰局的緊張，因敵軍總反攻而突入決戰階段的緬甸戰綫，以伊洛瓦底江畔爲中心，尤其是緬北臘戍周圍地區，戰况極爲活潑。敵第一軍進出錫威南方地區，同時其第五十師逐漸滲　臘戍西北廿公里，南茲西南方，日軍當即展開大邀擊戰於伊洛瓦底江畔，緬北戰局因而益趨緊張。此方戰綫的日軍行動，一切均以夜間爲限，蓋白晝敵機猖獗，甚至撒於業林間的一張紙，亦可成爲敵機目標，對於無人居住的小村落，亦會濫行轟炸，在鏖烟蔽天時，復澆汽油，更飛到很低，用降落傘放下間諜。</p>
<p>至於日軍的戰術，則全面採用肉搏衝鋒，避過敵機耳目，專事夜間行動，趁月黑天暗的時候，發揮奇襲妙諦，白晝則待機於叢林內，秘密隱藏，一至夜間，復勇敢迂迴敵軍陣地，出其不意，以少數兵力完成巨大戰果。</p>
<p>一方面，雲南遠征軍則在美軍重砲射整及飛機轟炸之掩護下，向前挺進。但日軍每於夜間移動陣地，以致敵機翌晨撲了一個空，徒然轟炸無人空陣地，同時日軍則於其意想不到的高地突行砲擊。緬北前綫的日軍，就如此利用百人以上集團行動不可能的叢林地形之利及飛機活動少效的夜晚等等敵方的弱點，佈下固如磐石的邀擊陣。（譯自三月六七日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>出淵部長分析　敵美作戰缺陷　人力不足軍需生產減低</h3>
<p>本市日陸軍報道部出淵部長，昨接見外籍記者時，曾就美國在進行作戰上之各種缺陷分析綦詳，茲錄談話內容如次：</p>
<p>造艦計劃縮小規模</p>
<p>三月二十七日，美國海國部發表謂軍艦建造計劃已予縮小規模云。二十九日海軍部長福萊斯特爾附加說明稱：「該項措嚴係根據戰時動員局長提案，並詳密調查全部軍事計劃所需人力資源而加決定者」。吾人不問其說明之眞實性如何，但最近美國內人力資源之不足，現有艦隊勢力之減弱，及鋼鐵深感缺乏等事實，已無法否認。</p>
<p>最近被視爲最大問題之美國强制人力資源法案，亦可明證美國人力的恐慌，羅斯福不顧國民反對，將二十七日經下議院通過之法案，立即要求上院亦予通過，並警吿稱：「礙於作戰指導」云。</p>
<p>人力不足影響生產</p>
<p>又據二月二十六日美國戰時生產局發表，一月份生產額比十二月減低一成，較預定目標差二成，軍需生產方面，無論船舶大砲等均不能達目標數量，於此可知人力不足已影響及重需生產，亦足表示美國不協助戰爭之態度。</p>
<p>最近英國艦隊已參加太平洋作　，此固爲美國所下歡迎者，然今日美國已無獨力支持戰爭之力量，不得不借重於英國艦隊。反之，美國務副卿格魯，對於日本抗戰力反有良好批評，謂日本有能力增加飛機裝甲車等軍器生產量，現在被美國擊落之飛機足以新造者補充有餘，目下動晨兵力已有四百萬，且每年可以二十五萬名　戰綫補充，而美國軍所殺傷日軍數不能及到此數云。吾人再顧雷伊泰。呂宋·琉黃島等敵軍喪失約在三十萬以上，深信在戰局最高潮時，吾人必可改取攻勢，對於漸呈義弱少美國，以舉團總力執干而起，勇敢殺敵云。</p>

<h3>The Japanese Prime Minister's Residence Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday; The Koiso Cabinet Resigned En Masse; Senior Ministers Convened in the Palace to Deliberate on Successor Candidates</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 7:00 PM on the 5th: Considering the gravity of the current situation, and in the hope that a stronger cabinet will emerge, the current cabinet has resigned en masse. Prime Minister Koiso has collected the resignations of all cabinet members and respectfully submitted them to the Emperor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Telegram: Since its formation on July 22nd of last year, the Koiso Cabinet has strived to manage the profound war situation and bear the heavy responsibility of governing the nation. Now, as the war situation changes rapidly and urgently, an even stronger cabinet is needed to advance towards the completion of the war. Therefore, it was decided that the cabinet would resign en masse. At 9:00 AM on the 5th, an emergency temporary meeting was convened at the Prime Minister's official residence. The Prime Minister first revealed his determination and sought the understanding of the cabinet ministers for the resignation. Consequently, the resignation was drafted during the cabinet meeting, and at 10:13 AM, it was respectfully submitted to the Palace. The Koiso Cabinet, from its formation, lasted eight and a half months and now it has decided to resign en masse.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – After the Koiso Cabinet decided to resign en masse on the 5th, His Majesty the Emperor summoned Kido Koichi, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, to inquire about candidates for the next prime minister. Kido Koichi, having received the imperial command, and considering the great importance of the situation, requested the senior ministers to attend a meeting in the Palace to gather opinions before responding to the imperial inquiry. Those in attendance included General Keisuke Okada, President of the Privy Council Suzuki, Hirota Koki, General Hideki Tojo, Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, Duke Fumimaro Konoe, Baron Reijiro Wakatsuki and other senior ministers. From 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, they successively entered the Palace and carefully discussed and expressed their opinions on the matter of selecting the next prime minister.</p>
<p>Reasons for the En Masse Resignation of the Koiso Cabinet</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since its formation last summer in July, the Koiso Cabinet established the Supreme War Guidance Council in order to ensure the unity of political and military affairs, and in response to the needs of wartime, it exerted all its efforts to increase the production of aircraft and military supplies. It also mobilized all its resources and was determined to implement decisive battle measures. However, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, due to the progress of the Philippine campaign, the loss of Iwo Jima, and the intensification of air raids, the war situation became increasingly serious. In order to reverse the tide, on March 16th, the cabinet, in accordance with the imperial will, decided that the Prime Minister could attend the Imperial General Headquarters meetings and further established the Supreme War Guidance Council to unify command and state affairs, so as to actively promote all policies. However, the severity of the war situation did not diminish, and it ultimately entered the critical stage of a decisive battle on the homeland. Therefore, to overcome this major crisis and establish an integrated relationship between command and state affairs was an urgent task. Thus, the cabinet keenly felt the need for fundamental improvement, but despite repeated efforts, it was unable to achieve the desired results. Therefore, it decided to look forward to the next cabinet and resolutely implemented the en masse resignation.</p>
<h3>Resignations of the Heads of the Miura and Ueba Offices</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Following the en masse resignation of the Koiso Cabinet, Miura, the Director-General of the Legislation Bureau, and Ueba, the Director-General of the General Planning Bureau, also submitted their resignations to Prime Minister Koiso on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on Taiwan</h3>
<p>Taipei, 5th (Central News Agency) – American planes from bases in the Philippines, totaling over fifty bombers and about fifteen fighters, attacked various parts of Taiwan in several waves throughout the day on the 3rd. The main targets were military facilities and urban areas near Chiayi, where bombing and strafing occurred. Bombs were also dropped on a section of Hualien Port. The planes retreated southward after 4:00 PM. Damage is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Three American Planes Lost in Attack on Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Between 11:40 AM and 2:30 PM on the 3rd, a combat-bomber squadron of 49 planes, mainly B-24s, attacked the Hong Kong area. Japanese air defense forces immediately engaged, shooting down or damaging three of them. Shortly thereafter, the enemy planes retreated. Japanese ships sustained slight damage.</p>
<h3>Consolidated War Results for Japanese Forces in Burma</h3>

<h3>National Government Solemnly Consecrates Confucius; Chairman Chen Presides Over the Ceremony</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The 5th was the day for the spring ritual for the Most Sage Teacher Confucius. The National Government held a solemn ceremony at the Confucius Temple in Chaotian Palace at 9:00 AM. Chairman Chen and civil and military officials attended and presided over the ceremony. Civil officials wore new national ceremonial attire or blue robes with black jackets, and military officials wore military uniforms with swords and badges. At 9:00 AM, the ceremony began in the Dacheng Hall. Chairman Chen took his place as the chief officiant amidst the music, accompanied by Wen Zongyao, Li Shengwu, Gong Shuangying, Zhou Longxiang, and Ju Xuechang. All stood in solemn respect. After the national anthem was sung, they paid the highest respect to Confucius, bowing three times, and stood in silent remembrance. Then, Chairman Chen personally offered flowers and respectfully read the memorial text. He then led all those accompanying him to pay tribute at the shrines of past sages. The chief officiant entered the Hall of Sages amidst the music, stood in solemn respect, presented flowers to the past sages, and gave a ritual bow. After the ceremony, all returned to the Dacheng Hall and sang the Confucius Commemoration Song. The Dacheng Hall was filled with the fragrant smoke of incense and bright candlelight, and the atmosphere was solemn. The ceremony concluded at around 10:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Garrison Forces Launch a Counterattack South of Chatan in Okinawa, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy with Hand-to-Hand Combat Tactics</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Enemy forces advancing southward on the west coast of Okinawa Island in the Chatan area had reached Oyama, three kilometers south of Chatan, by noon on the 4th. Under the cover of five tanks, the enemy attempted to attack the high ground southeast of Oyama. At that time, the Japanese garrison forces immediately engaged them, resulting in the destruction of four enemy tanks and the repulse of the enemy. Another enemy force, eager to use both the northern and central airfields, seems to have started using them even though some parts have not been completely repaired.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On Okinawa Island, American forces advanced towards Awase at noon on the 3rd, cutting the island in two from north to south. Currently, American forces are advancing south along the coast of Awase. At around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, an enemy force of about 400 men with 30 M4 tanks reached Kuba (about 5 kilometers south of Awase). In coordination with this, enemy forces in the Chatan area attacked Futenma with a unit of 10 M4 tanks on the evening of the 3rd, while another small unit of 23 tanks advanced to Kiyuna. Japanese garrison units are engaging the enemy at various locations. On the night of the 3rd, they launched a courageous hand-to-hand combat operation, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. On the morning of the 4th, four enemy battalions with about 50 tanks and numerous mortars, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked the areas north of Yae and Ginowan. Japanese units in the area immediately engaged them, and fierce fighting is underway. On the morning of the 4th, the enemy's line of attack stretched from Isa, Kiyuna, Futenma, and Aganiya to Kuba, with little change from the battle situation of the evening of the 3rd. Japanese air units continued their fierce attacks on enemy ships around Okinawa Island. The results of their operations from the morning of the 3rd to dawn on the 4th are as follows: Between 5:50 AM and 6:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, two large columns of fire were seen in the sea off the coast of the island. At around 1:20 AM, two more large columns of fire were seen in the sea south of Minatogawa. At 2:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, an enemy transport ship was burned south of Minatogawa. At 5:10 AM, a large column of fire also occurred to the west of the island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese ground forces are inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces that landed on Okinawa Island. Fierce counterattacks continue in various parts of the island, causing heavy casualties to the enemy. Japanese air defense units and naval units are responding to the ground forces' operations by launching repeated attacks on enemy fleets, gradually expanding their war gains. The General Headquarters announced on the 4th that these results are only from the period between dawn on the 2nd and dusk on the 3rd. It was confirmed that between 5:45 AM and 6:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, a unit of the Army Special Attack Force fiercely bombed enemy ships west of Okinawa Island, sinking two enemy cruisers and five large transport ships, and destroying one destroyer. At 6:00 AM, another unit of the Army Special Attack Force sank one large transport ship in the central sea off Okinawa. At 7:00 PM, another unit of the Army Special Attack Force fiercely attacked enemy ships near the Kerama Islands, sinking one battleship and two cruisers, and setting another ship of unknown type on fire. Based on these results, it can be seen that enemy ships near Okinawa have suffered significant damage. Combining previous results, a total of 170 ships have been bombed (including 4 aircraft carriers), 4 have been sunk or destroyed, and 79 have been damaged (including 3 aircraft carriers), for a total of over 190 ships.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Okinawa Island is Fierce and Prolonged; Director Cho Discusses the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>The regular meeting of the Allied Japanese Fleet Reporting Department in China was held yesterday afternoon. Director Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and many reporters attended. Director Matsushima elaborated on the Pacific War situation and the severe damage suffered by the enemy Americans. The following is an outline of his speech:</p>
<p>Heavy Losses of Enemy Vessels</p>
<p>The battles between the Japanese and American forces, centered on Okinawa Island, are gradually intensifying, and a portion of the enemy forces has already landed on the island. From the beginning of the American mobile fleet's air raids on Kyushu and Shikoku on March 17th to the American landing on the island, half a month has passed. According to enemy claims, there are a total of 1,400 ships operating on the front lines, including battleships, aircraft carriers, transport ships, and landing craft. The Japanese forces have launched fierce attacks on these enemy forces, using air units, naval units, and special attack units. As of April 3rd, most of these important ships used by the enemy on the front lines have been destroyed in the Japanese attacks, resulting in very serious losses for the enemy. On March 17th and 18th, the enemy forces that attacked southern Kyushu were forced to flee in disarray. However, the enemy continues to fight desperately. The significance of American losses can also be seen in the resignation of Paul McNutt, the director of the War Manpower Commission. In this decisive stage, the resignation of the director in charge of such an important task is because McNutt feels that the loss of manpower resources is too great.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Utilize New Tactics</p>
<p>After the enemy landed in northern Naha, they advanced eastward, passing through the narrow isthmus and cutting it off, but this action has no major significance, because the entire Naha area is only 325 square kilometers, 60 miles long and averaging 7 miles wide, with a narrow and elongated terrain. The Japanese forces, whether at sea or on land, are fighting boldly and very bravely. This battle is only in its beginning stages, and it has already caused the enemy such significant damage. The enemy's tactics are the same as in the past, with air units and naval units cooperating, using naval gun fire to cover the landing of tanks. The Japanese forces are using new tactics to counter the attacking enemy and inflict heavy damage on them.</p>
<p>Japanese Military and Civilians Fight Courageously</p>
<p>The enemy will face many difficulties in future operations. According to General Holland Smith, the commander of the enemy's amphibious forces, there are difficulties in both supply and transportation, so he stated that future operations will be very difficult. In short, Okinawa Island is not comparable to Iwo Jima in the past. In future operations, under extremely intense fire, the grasslands will be turned into ruins, and the people of the mountainous Okinawa Island will cooperate with the Japanese Imperial Army and fight bravely. Even women's units are participating in commando attacks. The military and civilians are united in fighting bravely against the enemy. The enemy has clearly disclosed this situation in its reports. Also, in this operation, the enemy has appointed Lieutenant General Buckner as the head of the military government, imposing strict punishments on civilians who hinder the American military. The oppression of the local residents by the American military is so great, and the attitude of the local residents is self-evident.</p>
<p>The United States Opposes British Ship Participation</p>
<p>The participation of the British fleet in the Pacific operations was anticipated by us and we felt that it was realized too late. The participation of the British fleet in the operations does not represent an increase in combat power. In fact, it more clearly reflects the severe damage suffered by the American navy in terms of both military strength and manpower. The United States has always opposed the British navy's participation in the Pacific operations, partly because of its sense of superiority in numbers, and partly because of postwar political issues. The United States has strongly opposed British participation in the war, but the British navy is now participating in the battle of Okinawa Island, which shows that the Americans have no other choice.</p>
<p>In the future, the Japanese forces will use air units, naval units, and land units to more thoroughly destroy the enemy and establish a glorious victory. Moreover, given the strategic importance of Okinawa Island, it is bound to turn into a long-term war, resulting in tragic consequences.</p>
<p>False Propaganda is a Common Enemy Technique</p>
<p>Finally, regarding propaganda, Director Matsushima reported two points as follows: The enemy's reporting propaganda has its consistent techniques. In the past, the figures disclosed for their own losses were always less than one-tenth of the actual figures, while the figures for Japanese losses were increased by more than ten times. For example, on April 1st, the Chongqing broadcast reported that the American air raid on Shanghai resulted in the destruction of more than 90 Japanese aircraft, the falsehood of which is evident. The enemy recently launched strategic propaganda in Manila, especially targeting Japanese officers. However, the spirit of the Japanese people is completely different from that of the British and Americans, and the enemy's propaganda will ultimately be a futile effort.</p>
<h3>Naval Special Attack Forces Attack Enemy Ships</h3>
<p>Southwest Base, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the night of the 3rd, Japanese naval special attack forces launched a suicide attack on enemy ships in the sea east of Okinawa. It has now been confirmed that one enemy destroyer has been destroyed.</p>
<h3>Germany Announces the Formation of "Werewolf Units" Striving for Freedom and Liberation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On Easter Sunday, Martin Bormann, head of the Nazi Party Chancellery, issued a proclamation of "victory or death" to party members nationwide. Following the establishment of Werewolf units in enemy-occupied territories, the flame of the German nation was ignited. The proclamation of "victory or death" called on all party members to dedicate themselves selflessly. The formation of Werewolf units, aimed at freedom and liberation through a national showdown, is a major milestone in the history of World War II.</p>
<h3>German Resistance Strengthens on the Western Front; American Forces Advance in Two Areas</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Havas reports that a German military spokesperson stated that no major battles have occurred on the Western Front up to noon on Wednesday. German resistance has strengthened. American forces have only made significant advances in two war zones. An American tank column, heading from Bielefeld, has advanced north to Bad Oeynhausen. In the Lingen area, American vanguard units have crossed the Ems River and are advancing towards Sögel. The target of the advance towards Bad Oeynhausen is apparently Westphalia, which would cut off the Wiehen Hills and open up the North German Plain. The flanks of the anti-Axis forces on that route are repeatedly threatened, and many tanks have been lost. German resistance has strengthened in the Lingen area, and many American tanks and gliders have been destroyed near Coesfeld.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German News Agency reports that German forces have now retaken Ochsenfurt, located 16 kilometers southeast of Würzburg, thus confirming the reports of increased German resistance in various war zones.</p>
<h3>German Military Announces Eastern Front Report</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German News Agency reports: The German military communiqué states that in the southern sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces continue to exert pressure between Deutsch-Drahndorf and the upper reaches of the Rabnitz River. German forces south of Vienna are fighting fiercely, intercepting Soviet forces advancing via Baden. Soviet attacks between Lake Neusiedl and the Danube River, and on the defensive line of Bratislava, were met with resistance after initial advances. In Upper Silesia, Soviet forces attempted again to break through between Breslau and Jägerndorf, but were repelled by German forces. Soviet forces continue to attack the fortress of Breslau, but Soviet forces that penetrated the western section have been encircled after fierce fighting. German forces on the west bank of the Bay of Danzig are fiercely resisting constant Soviet attacks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Havas reports that two Soviet forces advancing on Vienna and Bratislava from Hungary are progressing. The lines in central Slovakia, protruding too far east, have been automatically withdrawn for strategic reasons, and have not been pressured by Soviet forces.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Simultaneously Suppressing Speculation and Guiding Idle Capital</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion on speculation and idle capital pointed out that the vast amount of idle funds currently in Shanghai have failed to be guided towards normal investment, instead tending towards high-profit speculation. Therefore, we advocate simultaneously suppressing speculation and guiding idle capital. Here, we elaborate further as follows:</p>
<p>The chaos in the market, primarily caused by the rampant activity of idle capital, is undeniable. Moreover, because idle capital speculation can yield exorbitant profits, those holding funds are no longer considering legitimate industrial and commercial undertakings, and everyone is rushing towards the path of speculation. On the one hand, the market is becoming increasingly chaotic, and on the other hand, the exorbitant profits gained by speculators are entirely plundered from the "big fish eat small fish" process that occurs in an instant. Therefore, the more volatile the market, the more small fish will fail and collapse, with increasingly tragic consequences. Affected by this, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises are also speculating in the hope of profiting by chance. At the same time, major speculators—that is, those with vast amounts of idle capital—frequently resort to manufacturing and spreading rumors to create an advantage for their speculation. Therefore, if appropriate countermeasures are not quickly devised for the issue of idle capital, even if strict prohibition of rumors and suppression of enemy strategy are constantly proclaimed, in reality, it will inevitably be a case of "wildfires burn without end, the spring breeze blows and they grow again."</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the increasingly rampant evil of idle capital is actually due to the fact that although the authorities in the past spoke of strictly prohibiting speculation, they did not actually severely punish those who disrupted the market through speculation. As far as we know, the current authorities have already launched a close investigation into speculators who disrupt the market. Once evidence is found, they will inevitably be punished with the penalties they deserve, from which there will be no escape. We hope that the general public will earnestly report and assist the authorities in suppressing the sprouts of disorder. We believe that if a few big fish can be killed, the small fish will naturally restrain themselves upon seeing this!</p>
<p>Of course, suppressing speculation is a temporary solution to calm the market. At the same time, a fundamental solution is to guide idle capital towards normal investment, which is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, even if the current chaotic market can be calmed temporarily, there is still the possibility of a resurgence of troubles. First, study the reasons why idle capital is creating problems and take effective measures to prevent unnatural inflation of currency, to stabilize finance, which is essentially stabilizing people's minds. Because, without a doubt, the general public's desire to preserve the value of their currency is also a major factor fueling the evils of idle capital and speculation. Second, idle capital must be properly guided so that it is no longer concentrated in Shanghai alone, but flows to rural areas. Indeed, the inward flow of idle capital must first have a comprehensive and meticulous plan, ensuring that funds flow into the hands of every productive farmer, and not into the hands of disguised usurers, becoming tools for exploiting farmers' blood and sweat. Therefore, we advocate that Shanghai should take the financial community as its center and quickly discuss the organization of a rural loan syndicate, first providing agricultural loans to the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu. On this point, the Agricultural Loan Department of the Bank of Communications had considerable success in the past, and its handling experience can be used as a reference to formulate detailed measures. Third, we have consistently advocated increasing industrial and agricultural production. However, at this point, increasing production has become a secondary concern; the actual question is how to rapidly prevent production decreases and work stoppages. After severely suppressing speculation, the authorities must also point out a way out for fund holders. In addition to agricultural loans, they must also guarantee their investment in industry, mining, and legitimate commercial trade. On the one hand, how to improve transportation, increase coal shipments, and restore power supply to save Shanghai's industrial sector; on the other hand, how to thoroughly reform the securities trading market to make it a genuine way to guide idle capital to develop towards production. However, the current industrial environment in Shanghai is not easy to restore to its former scale. Rather than sticking to the old ways, it is better to seek a way out in the interior. Moreover, Shanghai's daily necessities industries mostly sell to rural areas in the interior, and for the sake of local sales, it is even more advisable to take the opportunity to relocate, which would also be the best policy in terms of business operations.</p>

<h3>Situation in Northern Burma</h3>
<p>Chongqing-US Forces Suffer Losses</p>
<p>The 16th Division of Wei Lihuang's Yunnan Expeditionary Force, which is heavily valued by the Chongqing side, has been fighting fiercely with the Japanese army for about ten months since last May, when it launched a general counter-offensive on the Nu River front under the supervision of the US military, breaking through Wanmading and other places on the Sino-Burmese border, lured by the US opening of the Ledo Road. Due to the Japanese army's "bleeding tactics", it has been almost completely exhausted, and is currently gathering its forces north of Wanmading, trying to restore its combat power. During this period, according to Chongqing soldiers captured by the Japanese army, the Yunnan Expeditionary Force suffered as many as 150,000 casualties. It is reported that the initial frontline force of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force numbered approximately 600,000, but since the start of the second Nu River operation last May, it has lost 150,000 men. To reorganize its ranks, it has successively replenished over 90,000 men, but most of them are poorly trained rabble and not an enemy of the Japanese army. It has suffered great losses due to attacks by the Japanese army, and its morale is also low. The US side also stated that the construction of the Ledo Road has been fraught with difficulties. It is reported that the Ledo Road, from India to China, is 1,444 miles long, and along the way, there is a tomb of a US soldier for every mile. The American force involved in the construction of this road exceeds 15,000, of which 65% (over 9,750) are Black.</p>
<p>Japanese Take Advantage of the Night to Strike the Enemy</p>
<p>With the intensification of the battles around Iwo Jima and Luzon, the Burmese front, which has entered a decisive stage due to the enemy's general counter-offensive, is extremely active, especially in the area around Lashio in northern Burma, centered on the banks of the Irrawaddy River. The enemy's First Army is advancing in the area south of Hsipaw, while its 50th Division is gradually infiltrating 20 kilometers northwest of Lashio and southwest of Nanzi. The Japanese army immediately launched a major ambush battle on the banks of the Irrawaddy River, thus making the situation in northern Burma more tense. The Japanese army's actions on this front are all limited to the night, because enemy aircraft are rampant during the day, and even a piece of paper scattered in the forest can become a target for enemy aircraft. They will also indiscriminately bomb uninhabited villages, then pour gasoline when the smoke fills the sky, and even fly very low and drop spies by parachute.</p>
<p>As for the Japanese army's tactics, they fully adopt bayonet charges, avoid the eyes and ears of enemy aircraft, and specialize in nighttime actions. They take advantage of the dark nights to display the essence of surprise attacks. During the day, they wait in the jungle, hidden in secret. At night, they bravely maneuver around enemy positions, catching them off guard, and completing huge victories with small forces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Yunnan Expeditionary Force is advancing under the cover of heavy artillery fire and aerial bombardment from the US military. However, the Japanese army moves its positions every night, so that enemy aircraft bomb empty positions the next morning in vain, while the Japanese army suddenly carries out artillery fire on unexpected high ground. The Japanese army on the northern Burma front is thus deploying a solid ambush, taking advantage of the terrain of jungles where group actions of more than 100 people are impossible, and the fact that aircraft activities are less effective at night, etc., which are weaknesses of the enemy.

Then, Mr. Luo Junqiang, the chief officiant, delivered a speech, stating briefly: "When commemorating Confucius, three points should be noted: First, the late Chairman Wang once said that Confucius is the eternal teacher of China and the common teacher of our compatriots. Because we have a common teacher to admire, Chinese culture has been promoted. This point must be noted. Second, Confucius has a progressive spirit of the times, which is necessary in politics, culture, and education. With this progressive spirit of the times, we can increase cultural progress and educational development. Third, Confucius is a pioneer who worked hard in his own position. Today, public officials, educators, and young people attending the ceremony should work hard in their own positions."

Mr. Idebuchi, the director of the press department of the Allied Japanese Army, was invited to attend and provide guidance. Director Idebuchi arrived on time, accompanied by Lieutenant Maehara, Yokota, and Kai, and others. The following newspaper offices were represented: Osaka and Ichii from the Continental New Report, Xu Liqiu and Yang Huilang from the Chinese Daily, Ni Diesun from the Ping Bao, Chen Binsu from the Shen Bao, Jiang Xiaoguang and Zhu Yongkang from the National News, Chen Riping and Lu Feng from the News Report, Zheng Jie from the New China Report, He Daxiong from the New Shen Bao, and Qiu Shimu from the Shanghai Jiang Daily.

Subsequently, Mr. Kai, Mr. Yokota, and representatives of various newspapers, including Xu Liqiu, Chen Riping, and Lu Feng, expressed their opinions. Finally, Chen Binsu summarized the opinions and made specific conclusions. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Director Idebuchi Analyzes: Defects in the Enemy's U.S. Operations: Insufficient Manpower and Reduced Military Production</h3>
<p>Director Idebuchi of the Japanese Army Press Department in this city, when meeting with foreign reporters yesterday, provided a very detailed analysis of the various defects in the U.S. war effort. The following is a record of his remarks:</p>
<p>Scaled-Down Shipbuilding Plan</p>
<p>On March 27th, the U.S. Navy Department announced that the warship construction plan had been scaled down. On the 29th, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal added, "This measure is based on a proposal by the Director of the War Mobilization Bureau and a detailed investigation of the manpower resources required for the entire military plan." Regardless of the truthfulness of his explanation, the recent shortage of manpower resources in the United States, the weakening of the existing fleet, and the severe shortage of steel are undeniable facts.</p>
<p>The recently regarded as the biggest problem of the U.S. Mandatory Manpower Resources Act can also clearly prove the panic of U.S. manpower. Roosevelt, disregarding national opposition, immediately requested the Senate to pass the bill that had been passed by the House of Representatives on the 27th, and warned, "It is hindered by operational guidance."</p>
<p>Manpower Shortage Affects Production</p>
<p>According to the U.S. War Production Board's announcement on February 26th, January's production volume decreased by 10% compared to December and was 20% short of the planned target. In terms of military production, whether it is ships or cannons, the target quantity cannot be reached. From this, it can be seen that the manpower shortage has affected heavy production and is enough to indicate the U.S.'s uncooperative attitude towards the war.</p>
<p>Recently, the British fleet has participated in the Pacific operations. This is naturally welcomed by the United States. However, today the United States no longer has the strength to support the war alone and has to rely on the British fleet. On the contrary, U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew has a good criticism of Japan's resistance, saying that Japan has the ability to increase the production of military equipment such as aircraft and armored vehicles, and the aircraft shot down by the United States are sufficient to replenish the newly built ones. There are currently four million military forces, and 250,000 soldiers can be added to the front line every year, while the number of Japanese troops killed or injured by the U.S. military cannot reach this number. Considering the enemy forces lost in Leyte, Luzon, and Iwo Jima, etc., are about 300,000 or more, it is firmly believed that in the highest tide of the war, we will be able to take the offensive, and for the gradually weak United States, we will raise the total strength to take up the shield and bravely kill the enemy.</p>

<h3>East China University Educational Fellowship Expresses Great Enthusiasm for the Free School</h3>
<p>The students of East China University have enthusiastically participated in and contributed greatly to our newspaper's free elementary school. Now, we have received a letter from the Educational Fellowship of the school, expressing great enthusiasm and unlimited hope, and donating a large sum of money, books, and supplies, their kindness is deeply appreciated. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Ehrenburg once wrote about French society, 'On one hand, there is serious work, and on the other hand, there is debauchery and shamelessness.' However, why can't it be used as a portrayal of this time and place? When we see and hear that such a work is about to begin, sir, you know how much joy, how much happiness, and how much excitement we have! Shouldn't we do our best to dedicate our strength to participate in and help this sacred work? What we should be ashamed of is that our strength is so weak that it is almost impossible to talk about anything in the overall work. Accompanying this letter is not just this money and these old books, but also that great affection and unlimited hope. A few days ago, we mobilized almost all the students to take turns participating in helping the enrollment work of ten schools. Today, we are sending this money and these books. In the future, we are always ready to dedicate ourselves, forever. For ourselves, for others, we are indeed thinking this way and are willing to do so. Attached are a donation of 55,800 yuan, 436 old books, 5 western notebooks, a dozen pencils, a pencil box, and a pair of leather shoes. We respectfully hope to accept them."</p>

<h3>General Traffic Situation on the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway</h3>
<p>— Jiaxi</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Suzhou highway has been in disrepair for many years due to war conflicts, resulting in many collapses east of Shanghai to Nanxiang and along the Waikuatang section, with the Zhongshan Road area being the most damaged.</p>
<p>Most of the bridges along the way are severely damaged, not only are the bridge foundations unstable, but the bridge planks are also completely scattered. Although some repairs have been made recently by a certain party, due to unsuitable materials and the temporary nature of the repairs, they are still unusable. Heavy military vehicles must unload their goods and cross the bridge empty, wasting a lot of time. As for cars falling into the river, it is also a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The places along this line include Zhenru, Nanxiang, Jiading, Waigang, Taicang, Kunshan, Zhengyi, Weishi, Waikuatang, Guanbinli, and Suzhou, a total distance of about 200 li: Shanghai to Jiading is about 70 li, Jiading to Taicang is 36 li, Taicang to Kunshan is 24 li, and Kunshan to Suzhou is 72 li.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, Huazhong Automobile Company runs four buses daily, two to Jiading and two to Taicang, but they are sometimes suspended or canceled due to circumstances. Recently, several business companies have been established, which will be described in brief below.</p>
<p>Beihai Enterprise Transportation Company - Shanghai General Company is located at 290 Sixth Malu Road, and the Suzhou office is located at 100 Hengmalu Road outside Zhimen. It is entrusted by the Suzhou Automated Military Region of Huazhong Railway. Manager Qi Shaofeng. There are three large buses (large trucks with canopies and long benches): Fare: 3,000 to Nanxiang, 5,000 to Jiading, 7,000 to Waigang, 8,000 to Taicang, 12,000 to Kunshan, and 15,000 to Suzhou.</p>
<p>Haifeng Trade Transportation Company - The general company is located at Room 127, 400 Suzhou Road, and the ticket office is located at No. 1 Fu Lane east of the Taishan Road Empire Theater. Manager Zhu Zhenchuan has three large cars, one running to Changshu and two running between Shanghai and Suzhou. Fares are 3,000 to Nanxiang, 5,000 to Jiading, 6,000 to Waigang, 7,000 to Taicang, 11,000 to Changshu, 10,000 to Kunshan, and 12,000 to Suzhou. In response to the evacuation of the population, the company offers a 20% discount to passengers with evacuation association documents or those with "return to hometown" marked in blue on their movement permits, a move that is worth emulating by other companies.</p>
<p>Hezhong Automobile Company - 182 North Xizang Road (intersection of Kaitui Road), managed by Zhu Jiazhen, currently has more than a dozen charcoal-fired vehicles, specializing in chartered services to Suzhou and Changshu. The charter price per vehicle is 80,000 to Taicang, 120,000 to Kunshan, 168,000 to Changshu, and 180,000 to Suzhou.</p>
<p>Huatong Automobile Company - Located at the intersection of Guizhou Road, Second Malu Road, managed by Zhang Zhichong, has large vehicles and some small vehicles (all stored by car owners, and the business is based on account settlement), running the Changshu line.</p>
<p>Hujia Automobile Company - The business department is located at the north end of Xinzha Bridge, and the address is 480 Xinjiang Road, with about 50 small vehicles, specializing in Jiading, and also running to Suzhou or Changshu upon passenger request.</p>
<p>Linsen Automobile Company - Has two large cars running to Suzhou, Manager Wang Songhe.</p>
<p>In addition, there are Hailu, Dade, Hexing, and other companies, but they are still under investigation due to their recent establishment.</p>
<p>Luggage and small items are not charged, and large luggage is charged according to area and weight. Large buses can carry a maximum of 40 people with luggage, and small cars can carry a maximum of 7-8 people. The departure points are all at the doors of the respective companies, generally departing at 8:00 or 9:00 AM daily and arriving in Suzhou around 3:00 PM, requiring 7 hours. If there is a slight delay, it may take until 5:00 PM to arrive. Small cars can arrive in 4-5 hours due to convenient bridge crossings, fewer passengers, and fewer troubles. It is necessary to show a residence permit and be subjected to luggage inspection when passing through inspection stations along the way. Passengers must get off the bus at damaged bridges.</p>
<p>There are numerous large and small inspection agencies along the journey, and some are mobile. Starting from Shanghai, the inspection agencies are listed as follows: Jianghai Customs Zhongshan Road Branch, Police Bureau and Ministry of Finance Anti-Smuggling Office, Zhengfeng College Police Team, Yangjiaqiao Police Station, Zhenru Police Station, Hujiagou Grand Inspection Station in Jiading County, Nanxiang to Jiading checkpoint, Jiading West Gate Bridge Police Station and Security Team, Waigang Security Team Garrison, the Grand Inspection Station at the junction of Taicang and Jiading, Taicang West Gate Police Station and Security Team, Kunshan Grand Inspection Station, Kunshan East City Bridge Inspection Station, Kunshan Central City Police Station, Zhengyi Grand Iron Bridge Garrison Team, Wailutang Garrison Team, Weishi Station Ailu Team and Military Police Special Task Force, Guanbinli Tax Office (Water Patrol), Suzhou Station Inspection Station, and dozens of other places.</p>
<p>Business companies face many difficulties, one is that the cost is too high. Currently, each small car is worth about 2 million yuan, and large cars are worth 7-8 million yuan. It is not easy to purchase oil and tires. The black market price of oil is around 10,000 per gallon, and the price of small car tires is generally around 200,000 each, and the price of large truck military tires is more than 700,000 each. Second, the contact fees along the way are huge, reportedly accounting for more than 60% of the total operating expenses. Third, the various companies lack contact with each other. If a vehicle is damaged, those with few vehicles cannot continue the next day.</p>
