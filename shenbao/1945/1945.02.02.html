<h3>日精銳部隊突擊　呂宋島敵受重創　明剛方面日軍展開機動戰</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫一日中央社電　呂宋島敵軍三師，直向馬尼刺南下，向仁牙因沿岸活動，日軍精銳部隊即施以突擊，馬尼刺平原地帶之日軍，亦相呼應於各地，痛擊南下之敵軍，達莫迭斯東方，二十七日山本中將以下數班挺進突擊隊，奇　敵軍彈藥庫綫，鹵獲噴射式砲彈五十箱，佐藤上指揮之工兵隊，向二十七日來襲之敵軍，以二百五十枚地雷一舉爆炸，一時敵惶恐不及逃遁，死傷頗衆，並鹵獲敵糧草彈藥頗多，敵軍此次受日軍之突擊，極爲狼狽，急向南下之各部隊遺派步哨多名，並變更戰車位置，採取立刻遁走之情形，自登陸以來，於仁牙因沿岸附近之敵軍，損失死傷七千餘名，擊毀戰車七十餘輛，其中突擊部隊戰果目下判明者，實死傷八百名，炸毀戰車六十餘輛。</p>
<p>菲島基地一日中央社電　仁牙因　東方地區之敵軍，以主力約四師之衆反覆攻擊，遭日軍前綫之邀擊及挺身隊之突擊，損失至大，至三十一日止，日軍突擊隊斃敵約達萬人，約一師之兵力。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地一日中央社電　焦於南下敵有力部隊，三十日以其一部由距離馬尼刺約七十公里之地區，侵八運結巴打半島之聖法南多，又其另一部隊，由羅沙留，根巴公路南下，於明剛正面，遂次增强兵力，日軍對此，除展開機動作戰外，更隨處勇作突擊，並出動戰車，痛擊驕敵。二十九日正午，擁有戰車十輛及迫擊砲數門之敵軍約三百之衆，曾行攻擊明剛西南地區，對此，日軍乃以多數突擊隊，予以猛烈反攻，而予以重創，並於姆尼奧斯方面，對兩度進擊之約二百敵軍悉予擊退，而粉碎該方敵軍之蠢動野望。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地一日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，二十九日傍晚曾攻擊加莫迭斯海方面之敵小舟艇軍，將其數艘擊沉。</p>
<h3>日總動員計劃　着手進行中　那須兵務局長答質問</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日那須陸軍省兵務局長，昨下午於衆議院兵役法委員會席上，答覆植松練磨氏之質問，其要旨如次：據最近所獲情報稱，一時降低軍動員計劃之美國，似已再度進入增加狀態，英國於軍動員計劃或總動員計劃上之困難狀態，均爲國民全體所周知，與此相比較，日本之軍動員狀况，較之其他各交戰國均有餘裕，然於生產機構，機械，後術關係上，日本之總動員人員，較之美國等，似亦有需要人力之處，其狀况與敵方則完全不同，故對此爲完成常前戰爭之軍動員兵力，前已與關係各方充分連絡，即除抽出軍動員之人員外，對總動員計劃，並無絲毫障得，刻正着手進行中。</p>
<h3>澳陸長譽揚　日軍精神</h3>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　據康伯拉訊，澳洲陸長福特氏，三十日將西南太平洋日軍之激烈戰鬥精神向美國國民廣播稱：澳洲軍自開戰以來，曾以最大之兵力進入馬加薩麾下之後，於新幾內亞及其他西南太平洋各島嶼與該方面之具有優秀裝備之日軍作戰時，更深知其不惜生命之强烈之戰鬥精神，故於各該島嶼之戰爭，不能謂爲掃蕩作戰，且自美軍進駐以後，匪律賓一帶之島嶼雖歸澳洲軍手中，然日軍之抵抗仍極强烈，故澳洲軍之兵力實有增强之必要。</p>
<h3>巨港人民　恊助作戰</h3>
<p>巨港一日中央社電　二十九日十時許，敵艦載機約一百數十架來襲巨港地區，經當地日軍勇猛邀擊，擊落及擊毀共約九十架，敵機無暇投彈，倉卒遁走。敵機墜落之遺骸，零落飛散於市內及郊外之森林潮濕地帶，發生之火炎，旋即經當地民衆及日軍等積極撲減，該地少義勇軍，在機塲或軍隊中與日軍駢肩作戰，其勇敢精神，實出於想像。當二十九日敵機來襲時，雖亦受傷，然仍從事搬運或射擊之，據某某部隊長稱，當地人民目下毅然參加日軍作戰，其不惜一切之精神，至堪驚嘆。</p>
<h3>華南日軍　佔富國煤鑛　鑛內設施均歸日軍所有</h3>
<p>華南前綫一日中央社電　佔領韶關之日軍，其挺進隊，仍向北江右烽北進，二十七日下午將韶關北方約十六公里之富國煤鑛佔領，渝軍因日電進攻迅速，一時末克將該煤鐵破壞，故凡鑛內之輕便鐵道發電廠，自來水設施以及土架工廠修理工廠等，均全部爲日軍所有。</p>
<h3>航空縱深陣地　佈置完成</h3>
<p>中國某基地一日中央社電　此次日軍打通粵漢路及華南沿海作戰，自航空戰略觀，其意義極大，海軍決戰之先，常爲空軍决戰，如何取得戰區上空之制空權，空軍基地之布置，則爲主因；然於敵軍企圖於中國大陸連續之際，粵漢綫以東仍留渝殘軍第一綫基地，當然於日軍航空防衛戰上極爲不利，故日軍爲澈底覆減之，此次始决定展開沿岸攻勢，渝軍沿海基地之中，除福建省新城等地已相繼潰滅外，迄今殘留者僅遂川·贛州及廣東北部之南雄各基地而巳。日軍以南北兩軍協力急進，遂川早已佔領，目下自此等被　日軍佔領之基地觀，自己化爲日軍之基地，與挂林·柳州線相通息，東至海岸線約一千公里之置大地域閒，被佔領基地已達十五處以上，因之强力之日軍航空蹤深基地，業已形成，且此貫通華南之廣範地域間，已早無渝美軍可利用爲臨時機塲之餘地，目下日軍中國航空轟炸態勢，各基地兵力之鞏固，已如磐石</p>
<h3>粵漢綫南段打通　戰略上意義重大　日軍報道部詳加說明</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電　日軍報道部一日下午四時，假福昌飯店日本記者俱樂部接見中國記者團，就此次粵漢綫南部之打通，及其干戰略上之重要實義，詳加闡述，其要旨加次：</p>
<p>粵漢綫南部地區，本年一月一日起，日軍由南北兩部夾攻北部方面，又分兩路：一路由道縣及零陵西向粵漢綫橫側進攻，一路由耒陽順粵漢路直向樂昌正面進過。華南日軍亦同日分兩路沿粵漢錢向北推進，一路由四會進攻淸遠，一路則由花縣沿粵漢綫東側，直迫韶關，干一月廿七日兩軍遂于韶關北携手，完成粵漢路之貫通。此次戰事中最値注目者，厥爲樂昌與白石間之橋樑隧道之保全，蓋湘粵交界處隧道橋樑極多，且工程險峻，一旦破壞，恢復至感困難，故日軍爲澈底確保該處隧道橋樑不使多損計，則于一月八日由軍中選拔精銳士兵組挺身隊，以突擊姿態，重慶軍隊以戰力薄弱及士氣低下，故于此次作戰全無抵抗，大部向鐵道兩側山地間退走，與此粵漢綫南部戰事呼應之另一路日軍，由湘贛邊境之運花旁攻佔遂川，並正在繼續追擊殘餘渝軍，向贛州挺進。按遂川贛州爲駐渝美空軍東南前綫戰鬥機隊之基地，邇來襲擾京滬及華南一帶之敵戰鬥機隊，皆出動于此，故今後華中地區將不復再受敵機之擾亂矣。此次粵漢綫南段之打通，其于戰略上之價値，約有下列三點。（一）渝第七戰區之覆沒，（二）渝軍第四第七第三戰區之孤立，（三）大陸戰綫上日軍之機動性將益爲活躍。</p>
<h3>貫通粵漢路防禦益增強</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日軍自於綏淥會師貫通大陸戰綫後，敵美焦燥更甚，乃於太平洋方面展開積極行動，事後曾在雷伊泰灣及明多羅島登陸，近更一面圖爭奪呂宋島，並有於中國大陸沿岸登陸之趨勢，日軍對敵美之行動，將予以致命之打擊。現於菲島已收獲莫大戰果，而大陸戰綫日軍先錄之侵入黔省，使渝軍向內地遷移，在在顯示出日軍戰力之雄厚。此次華中·華南日軍爲更進一步鞏固大陸防禦戰綫，自本月九日開始對粵漢綫自耒陽至英德南方源潭墟」千餘里間地區，猛烈進攻，並於二十四日量佔領渝軍第七戰區司令部韶關，渝軍刻正向西北潰走中，另一部日軍同時佔領遂川機塲，至此粵漢綫已完全由日軍堂握。日軍此次貫通粵漢錢後，其對此後大陸作戰更形有利，蓋日軍打通此綫，不僅對大陸一貫戰綫益收輔翼之效，且直接對華南沿海岸綫之防禦運輸力調動更形靈活，對敵美登陸企圖，當能應付裕如。此次渝軍曾作積極反攻之舉，故渝軍兵力集結貴陽，更一面配備十一師兵力於湘粵邊境新田，桂陽，祁武一帶，企圖蠢動，積極阻擾日軍，幸日軍打通粵漢綫後，已將該項反攻企圖完全粉碎，且使第三，第九，第七戰區渝方殘餘力量，更難結集呼應，且由於遂川機場之被佔領，渝美空軍遊擊戰力更形减低，此後渝軍之所謂反攻，將告一段落，渝軍經此挫折後，敵美之焦慮，陸企圖，亦將愈形積極，蓋美軍意圖擊敗日軍，擬展開猛烈之海陸兩面作戰，在大陸方面，當然倚重渝軍，然而渝軍竟告失敗，予敵美戰略以一大刺激，其爲呼應大陸作戰，不得不力圖急速實現登陸之慾望，然日軍對此又未雨綢繆，早已在惠州地區駐屯軍隊，對整個華南沿岸，形成極堅强之防禦，一旦美軍來犯，必遭日軍猛力反繫無疑。同時敵軍如果　險來襲，實犯深入之大忌，因呂宋島仍在激戰中，侵犯大陸之敵機，適　日軍之截擊，故敵軍　燥之呼應登陸戰，自涇日軍打通粵漢綫後，更予日軍發揮有利之殲敵良機也</p>
<h3>讀納爾遜與哈萊報告書後</h3>
<p>— 萬西白</p>
<p>近來美國陸續發表「關於中國的報告」。如美國戰時情報局，「關於中國的正式報告」，羅斯福特使孟斯費爾特在議會上的中國情況報告，以及去年八月爲重建中國戰時經濟而特派來華的戰時生產局長納爾遜及哈萊少將的報告都是。其中，納爾遜與哈萊的報告除陳述他們的工作經過以外，並率直說明中國將來供美國帝國主義利用的價値，誠饒興味。而且，此項報告曾經羅斯福過目，羅斯福自已認爲不妨發表的部分，最近已公佈出來了。上列三個報告，目的既異，表現方式亦各不相同，其間互相予盾之點，也不在少數，而其一致的典通點，則爲露骨表明爲遂行對日戰爭及强化美帝國主義起見，欲使中國完全隸屬於美國的野心。尤其是納爾遜與哈萊的報告，甚至在叙述中國經濟建設的一部分中，也充份具體地流露這種野心。如此說來恐柏在羅斯福不敢公布的那部分中，有着令重慶更加不快的如意打算吧</p>
<p>該報告業已公布的部分中，詳述在重慶設立戰時生產局的經過，以及美國的期望。其中關於「美國的期望」，則具體表明如下：</p>
<p>「美國的生產技術人員已在中國開始工作。十一月我從中國歸來時，曾和海外經濟局談妥，我曾偕去六個生產技術專家，其中五個是鍊鋼專家，一個是製造酒精的專家。這些優秀的專家立即訪問中國的工廠，研究其生產方法。他們爲增加產量，改良品質，減低生產費起見，將協助中國企業經營者及政府官吏工作三個月以上。主要目的便在增加中國軍隊所需某種軍需品的直接生產。」</p>
<p>在戰局的現階段中，以貧乏的鐵鑛資源爲基礎，而圖着手建立鍊鋼業，是誠合乎「急　風遇着慢郎中」這句俗諺了。重慶的商業日報最近抨擊戰時生產局道：</p>
<p>「自創設戰時生產局，翁文　就任長以來，已有相當時日，但增加生產之具體的根本方針，猶未決定，生產者殊感失望。生產局既未援助生產者，且迄今猶未開過一次會議。」</p>
<p>信哉斯言—其實，這樣的事一聞開始就可明白。何以言之？蓋納爾遜的計劃毋寗是着重於戰後的，正如基督科學勸世報曾經指明，並未想到即刻使「中國成爲愛好自由國家之大兵工廠」等事。戰時生產局根本就是作爲美國使中國完全殖民地化的基石而設立起來的。美國在遂行對日戰爭時所擬課於重慶的任務，不外是任意利用中國龐大的人力資源及作爲對日攻擊根據地的地理條件。美國之熟心調解渝共合作，原因亦在於此。至於設立戰時生產局一事其目前所望的效果，大的是振作重慶民心吧。關於此點，納爾遜叙述如次：</p>
<p>「中國戰時生產局的設立及技術派遺員的到達，對中國人民的戰意已有直接的效果。」</p>
<p>換言之，不拘宣傳方面如何大吹大擂，重慶的戰時生產局，對於抗戰的質獻，從經濟上看，簡直無足稱道。這一點，納爾遜及哈萊的報告也巳不打自招了。總而言之，它並不是「戰時」生產局，充其量只是一個「戰後」生產局而已。</p>
<p>納爾遜與哈萊的報告，末了下結論道：</p>
<p>推行中國有計劃的戰時生產之嘗試，如果成功，中美的經濟關係戰後將愈密切。中國其有藉美國的援助而發展本國產業的可能性與希望。</p>
<p>「此種援助如果是現實的，則必建築於健全的商業基礎上。中國在戰後將代日本而爲遠東領導的工業國家。那時，對於美國的輸出產業，大規模的市塲將累進地開闢出來。」</p>
<p>這的確是爽快的結論，遠大的計劃！哈萊在政治上，魏第瑪亞在軍事上，已竭力展開使重慶完全隸屬美國的活動，而納爾遜則在經濟上把握之，以此奠定政治上軍事上隸屬美國的基礎。他的計劃假使成功，則戰後的中國將完全化爲美國的殖民地，那時不僅中國衆多的人口，甚至整個遠東的各民族，均將成爲金元資本苛酷榨取的對象。而美國商業將以其壟斷的價格從「累進地開闢出來」的遠東市場取得無限的利潤。可是，這當然不過是垣街片面的「野心」，妄貨更宜的春夢而已。納爾遜與哈萊的報告已自動露骨地將逼種野心和夢想暴露出來了。這在爲解敢東亞民族而戰的日本，又是良好的宣傳資料，同時，也現實地暴露美國對渝以及對東亞各民族的猙獰面目。在道意義下，對於公開發表此項報告的羅斯福，我們深致謝意！</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>強化同業公會</h3>
<p>上海工商業組織同業公會，已有很久歷史。自從民三十二年三月間國府制定工商同業公會暫行條例以後，各業即重組公會。現在經經濟局核准設立的各業公會，共有兩百餘單位，這些公會在本市經濟組識中當然居於極重要的地位。</p>
<p>按同業公會的任務，在暫行條例第二條中明白規定爲：「工商同業公會以協助政府施行經濟政策，及增進同業之公共利益爲宗旨。」在平時協助政府施行經濟施策，在目前戰時，尤應負起推行戰時經濟政策的任務。就戰時經濟任務而言，較之平時加倍重要。因爲現代戰爭是總力比賽，經濟職是總力戰中重要部門，原則上必須做到人民得到最低限度安定的經濟生活以後，貢獻一切經濟力量充實戰爭資源。因此工商業就應各本其在經濟部門中的地位，克盡任務。同業公會是聯合各本業的組織，俾更能發生集體力量，完成共同使命。</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會成立，以商業集體自治性質，開始實行統制經濟，其基層機構也即是同業公會，因此同業公會的任務更爲重要。爲盡其戰時經濟統制經濟的責任，强化組織與加强工作自更必要。可是，本市各業公會改組已將兩年，從客觀檢討，我們認爲未能如預期成效，今後應行强化之處，願陳所見如次：</p>
<p>（一）加强公會組織，合併性質相同之各業公會。同業分類不必太細，使盡量簡單化，因爲同業家數不多，各組公會，足以分散力量，而徒增開支。</p>
<p>（二）同業公會負責人，雖經推選，並須經主管當局審核，免除各業中不良份子利用把持，以孚業中人衆望者爲主要條件。擔任公會職務後，即應視爲實際工作，爲同業謀取福利。</p>
<p>（三）公會對於會員營業方針，隨時督察，如發現有囤積居奇行爲，應即糾正。惟有同業中人最爲熱知業中動態。</p>
<p>（四）主管當局對於公會動態隨時注意，一方面與各業公會負責人隨時取得聯繫，宣示政府施策，一方面督導積極工作，毋使形成閑散團體。</p>
<p>（五）各業增價，必須由公會提出理由向主管當局申請，不能任意或各自抬價。</p>
<p>（六）公會組織健全以後，即可發生集團力量，對於會員有所請求或遭遇因難時，依法向有關當局陳訴，自能受當局重視。</p>
<p>（七）公會絕非分利團體，同業利益即是本身利益，絕對不能假藉名義剝削會員利益，或向會員苛索。</p>

<p>以前汪故主席昭示我人「淸鄉必先淸心」，最近周市長就職時訓示說：「公益重於私利，社會先於個人」，我以爲擔任清鄉工作的，尤當拿上述的訓示，作爲我人工作最高的方針，本着苦幹，實幹，硬幹的精神，一步一步的　進做去，以建樹廉潔政治，而爲地方謀幸福。本人向來作事，以事業爲前提，不因新舊官畏交特而多所調動人事，庶幾工作效率，得因熟練而增進，故希望諸君安心工作，而且更加淬勵奮發，愈加努力，以共舉清鄉大業。</p>
<p>最後關於同人待遇，市畏最近對於市府所屬公務員之薪給及配給，正在設法改善，本人決當盡其力之可能，將本局同人生一活情况，向常局上達，力求改進。</p>
<p>今日因時間有限，以後見面談話機會正多，茲特提出上述數點，願與諸君共勉之」。</p>

        <h1>1945.02.02</h1>
<h3>Fierce Attack by Elite Japanese Troops; Enemy on Luzon Island Suffers Heavy Losses; Japanese Forces Launch Mobile Warfare on the Mingan Front</h3>
<p>Philippine Front, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Three divisions of enemy troops on Luzon Island marched directly south towards Manila, operating along the Lingayen coast. Elite Japanese troops launched a fierce attack, and Japanese forces in the plains around Manila responded in coordination, severely attacking the southward-moving enemy. East of Tarlac, on the 27th, several raiding units under the command of Lieutenant General Yamamoto, miraculously struck an enemy ammunition depot line, capturing fifty boxes of jet-propelled shells. An engineering unit under the command of Sato exploded 250 landmines against enemy troops attacking on the 27th. The enemy panicked and fled, suffering heavy casualties. A large amount of enemy supplies and ammunition were also captured. The enemy troops, severely battered by the Japanese attack, hastily dispatched many sentries to various units heading south, changed the positions of their tanks, and took immediate evasive action. Since landing, the enemy forces near the Lingayen coast have suffered over 7,000 casualties and had over 70 tanks destroyed. It is currently determined that the raiding units alone inflicted 800 casualties and destroyed 60 tanks.</p>
<p>Philippine Island Base, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy forces in the east of Lingayen, with a main force of approximately four divisions, launched repeated attacks. They were met with ambushes by Japanese frontline units and raids by suicide squads, suffering significant losses. Up to the 31st, Japanese raiding units have killed approximately 10,000 enemy troops, equivalent to about one division's strength.</p>
<p>Philippine Front Base, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy forces, anxious to advance southward, used a portion of their strong units on the 30th, from an area about 70 kilometers from Manila, to invade San Fernando on the Bataan Peninsula. Another unit advanced south along the Rosario-Guimba road, gradually increasing their forces on the Mingan front. The Japanese forces, in response, not only launched mobile warfare but also conducted daring raids everywhere, deploying tanks to fiercely attack the arrogant enemy. Around noon on the 29th, approximately 300 enemy troops, equipped with ten tanks and several mortars, attacked the southwest area of Mingan. The Japanese forces launched a fierce counterattack with numerous raiding units, inflicting heavy losses. In the Muñoz area, approximately 200 enemy troops who attacked twice were completely repelled, shattering the enemy's ambitions in that area.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the evening of the 29th, Japanese air units attacked enemy small boats near the coast of Gumaca, sinking several of them.</p>
<h3>National Mobilization Plan Underway; Director of Military Affairs Bureau Nasu Answers Questions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Director Nasu of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, in response to questions from Mr. Uematsu Renma at the House of Representatives' Military Service Law Committee yesterday afternoon, stated the following: According to recent intelligence, the United States, which had temporarily reduced its military mobilization plan, seems to have re-entered a state of increase. The difficulties faced by Britain in its military mobilization or general mobilization plans are well known to the entire nation. In comparison, Japan's military mobilization situation has more leeway than other belligerent nations. However, in terms of production facilities, machinery, and technical support, Japan's total mobilization personnel, compared to the United States and others, seems to require manpower in certain areas. Its situation is completely different from that of the enemy. Therefore, to complete the military mobilization forces for the ongoing war, we have fully communicated with all relevant parties. Except for the extraction of personnel for military mobilization, there are no obstacles to the general mobilization plan, which is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Australian Army Chief Praises Japanese Military Spirit</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Canberra dispatch, Australian Army Chief Ford, on the 30th, broadcasted to the American people about the fierce fighting spirit of the Japanese forces in the Southwest Pacific, stating: Since the start of the war, the Australian army, having deployed its largest forces to areas under MacArthur's command, and fought against well-equipped Japanese troops in New Guinea and other Southwest Pacific islands, has deeply recognized their intense fighting spirit and disregard for life. Therefore, the wars on those islands cannot be considered mere mopping-up operations. Even after the arrival of American forces, and although the Philippine islands have been brought into the hands of the Australian army, the Japanese resistance remains extremely strong. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the strength of the Australian army.</p>

<p>Palembang, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 29th, around 10:00 AM, approximately 110 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Palembang area. The local Japanese forces fiercely engaged them, shooting down or destroying about 90 aircraft. The enemy aircraft, unable to drop their bombs, fled in haste. The wreckage of the enemy aircraft was scattered throughout the city and the humid forests in the suburbs. The resulting fires were quickly extinguished by local residents and Japanese forces. The young volunteer corps in the area fought shoulder-to-shoulder with the Japanese forces at the airfield and in the military, demonstrating unimaginable bravery. Although they were injured when enemy aircraft attacked on the 29th, they continued to transport supplies and fire weapons. According to a certain unit commander, the local people are now resolutely participating in the Japanese war effort, displaying a spirit of self-sacrifice that is truly astonishing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in South China Occupy Fuguo Coal Mine; All Mine Facilities Become Japanese Property</h3>
<p>South China Front, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The raiding units of the Japanese forces occupying Shaoguan continued their advance north along the right side of the Beijiang River. On the afternoon of the 27th, they occupied the Fuguo Coal Mine, approximately 16 kilometers north of Shaoguan. Because of the rapid Japanese advance, the Chongqing forces were unable to destroy the coal and iron mine in time. Therefore, all the mine's light railways, power plants, water supply facilities, and earthwork factories and repair shops were seized by the Japanese forces.</p>
<h3>Completion of Air Defense-in-Depth Positions</h3>
<p>Certain Base in China, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - From the perspective of air strategy, the current Japanese operation to open the Yuehan Railway and the South China coast has great significance. The air force generally decides the outcome of a war before naval battles. Securing air superiority over the theater of war and deploying air bases are key factors. However, while the enemy attempts to maintain continuity on the Chinese mainland, the first-line bases of Chongqing's remaining troops east of the Yuehan Line are naturally extremely disadvantageous to the Japanese air defense war. Therefore, the Japanese forces have decided to launch a coastal offensive to thoroughly eliminate them. Among Chongqing's coastal bases, other than Xincheng and other places in Fujian Province, which have been successively destroyed, only Suichuan, Ganzhou, and Nanxiong in northern Guangdong remain. With the cooperation of the north and south armies advancing rapidly, Suichuan has already been occupied. Currently, from the perspective of these bases occupied by the Japanese forces, they have become Japanese bases and are connected to the Guilin-Liuzhou line. In the vast area extending approximately 1,000 kilometers east to the coastline, more than 15 occupied bases have been established. As a result, a powerful Japanese air defense-in-depth position has been formed. Moreover, in this vast area traversing South China, there is no longer any space for Chongqing-American forces to use as temporary airfields. The Japanese aviation bombing posture in China and the consolidation of forces at each base are now as solid as a rock.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Southern Section of the Yuehan Railway Has Great Strategic Significance; Japanese Press Department Provides Detailed Explanation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - At 4:00 PM on the 1st, the Japanese Press Department met with a group of Chinese reporters at the Japan Press Club in the Fuchang Hotel, providing a detailed explanation of the opening of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway and its important strategic significance. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>In the southern region of the Yuehan Railway, the Japanese forces, starting on January 1st of this year, launched a pincer attack from the north and south toward the northern area. They divided into two routes: one advanced west from Daoxian and Lingling, flanking the Yuehan Railway, and the other advanced directly north along the Yuehan Railway from Leiyang toward the front of Lechang. On the same day, the Japanese forces in South China also advanced north along the Yuehan Railway in two routes: one advanced from Sihui toward Qingyuan, and the other advanced along the east side of the Yuehan Railway from Huaxian, directly approaching Shaoguan. On January 27th, the two armies joined forces north of Shaoguan, completing the opening of the Yuehan Railway. The most noteworthy aspect of this battle was the preservation of the bridges and tunnels between Lechang and Baishi. There are numerous tunnels and bridges at the intersection of Hunan and Guangdong, and the construction is dangerous. Once damaged, restoration would be extremely difficult. Therefore, in order to thoroughly ensure that the tunnels and bridges in that area suffered no damage, the Japanese forces selected elite soldiers from the army on January 8th to form a suicide squad, which launched a surprise attack. Because the Chongqing army's combat power was weak and its morale was low, it offered no resistance in this battle and mostly retreated into the mountains on both sides of the railway. In coordination with the southern Yuehan Railway battle, another route of the Japanese forces, from the Xianggan border near Yunhua, occupied Suichuan and is continuing to pursue the remaining Chongqing troops toward Ganzhou. It should be noted that Suichuan and Ganzhou are bases for the southeast frontline fighter squadrons of the Chongqing-based American air force. Enemy fighter squadrons that have been harassing the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and South China areas have been operating from here. Therefore, the Central China region will no longer be disturbed by enemy aircraft. The strategic value of opening the southern section of the Yuehan Railway has the following three points: (1) the destruction of Chongqing's Seventh War Zone; (2) the isolation of Chongqing's Fourth, Seventh, and Third War Zones; (3) the Japanese forces' mobility on the mainland front will be greatly enhanced.</p>
<h3>Defense Strengthened after Connecting the Yuehan Railway</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the Japanese forces joined forces at Suilu, connecting the mainland battle line, the American-Chongqing forces became even more anxious and launched aggressive operations in the Pacific. Afterwards, they landed in Leyte Gulf and Mindoro Island, and recently they have shown a tendency to seize Luzon Island and land on the coast of mainland China. The Japanese forces will inflict a fatal blow on the American-Chongqing actions. Significant results have already been achieved in the Philippines, and the intrusion of Japanese forces into Guizhou on the mainland battle line has forced the Chongqing forces to move inland, demonstrating the strength of the Japanese forces. In order to further consolidate the mainland defense line, the Japanese forces in Central and South China began a fierce attack on the Yuehan Railway from Leiyang to Yingtak's southern Yuantanxu, an area of more than a thousand miles, on the 9th of this month, and on the 24th, they occupied Shaoguan, the headquarters of Chongqing's Seventh War Zone. The Chongqing troops are currently collapsing to the northwest. Another unit of Japanese forces simultaneously occupied Suichuan Airfield. By this point, the Yuehan Railway was completely under Japanese control. The Japanese forces' connection of the Yuehan Railway this time is even more beneficial to future operations on the mainland, because it not only serves to aid the unified battle line on the mainland, but also directly makes the defense, transportation, and mobilization capabilities on the South China coastline more flexible, enabling them to adequately respond to American-Chongqing attempts to land. The Chongqing troops made an active attempt to counterattack. They concentrated forces in Guiyang and deployed eleven divisions of troops in Xintian, Guiyang, Qiwu area on the Hunan-Guangdong border, in an attempt to stir up trouble and actively hinder the Japanese forces. Fortunately, after the Japanese forces connected the Yuehan Railway, they completely crushed that counterattack attempt and made it even more difficult for the remaining forces of Chongqing's Third, Ninth, and Seventh War Zones to gather and respond. Furthermore, due to the occupation of Suichuan Airport, the guerrilla warfare capabilities of the Chongqing-American air force have been reduced. From now on, Chongqing's so-called counterattack will come to an end. After this setback, the anxiety and attempts of the American-Chongqing forces will become more active, because the American military intends to defeat the Japanese forces and launch a fierce land and sea battle. On the mainland, they naturally rely heavily on the Chongqing army, but the Chongqing army has failed, giving the American-Chongqing strategy a major shock. In order to respond to the mainland operations, they have no choice but to try to rapidly realize their desire to land. However, the Japanese forces have already prepared for this and stationed troops in the Huizhou area, forming an extremely strong defense along the entire South China coast. Once the American army invades, it will inevitably be met with a fierce Japanese counterattack. At the same time, if the enemy rashly attacks, it will be a major taboo to penetrate deep, because Luzon Island is still in fierce battles, and enemy aircraft invading the mainland will be intercepted by the Japanese forces. Therefore, after the Japanese forces connected the Yuehan Railway, they provided the Japanese forces with a favorable opportunity to annihilate the enemy in a responsive landing battle that was driven by anxiety.</p>
<h3>After Reading the Nelson-Halleck Report</h3>
<p>— Wan Xibai</p>
<p>Recently, the United States has successively released "Reports on China." These include the U.S. Wartime Information Bureau's "Official Report on China," Roosevelt's envoy Mansfield's report to Congress on the situation in China, and the reports of War Production Board Director Nelson and Major General Halleck, who were specially sent to China last August to rebuild China's wartime economy. Among these, the Nelson-Halleck report, in addition to outlining their work process, frankly states the future value of China for exploitation by American imperialism, which is quite interesting. Moreover, this report has been reviewed by Roosevelt, and the part that Roosevelt himself considered appropriate to publish has recently been released. The purposes of the above three reports differ, and their modes of expression are also different. There are also many contradictions among them, but their common thread is the blatant expression of the ambition to completely subordinate China to the United States in order to carry out the war against Japan and strengthen American imperialism. In particular, the Nelson-Halleck report reveals this ambition fully and concretely, even in the section describing China's economic construction. It is feared that the part that Roosevelt dared not publish contains wishful thinking that would further displease Chongqing.</p>
<p>The published portion of the report details the establishment of the War Production Board in Chongqing and the expectations of the United States. Among these, the "expectations of the United States" are specifically stated as follows:</p>
<p>"American production technicians have begun working in China. When I returned from China in November, I agreed with the Foreign Economic Administration that I would bring six production technicians, five of whom are steelmaking experts and one of whom is an alcohol manufacturing expert. These outstanding experts will immediately visit Chinese factories to study their production methods. They will assist Chinese business operators and government officials for more than three months in order to increase production, improve quality, and reduce production costs. The main purpose is to increase the direct production of certain military supplies needed by the Chinese army."</p>
<p>In the current stage of the war, starting to build a steel industry based on scarce iron ore resources is truly fitting of the saying "rushing to meet a slow doctor." Chongqing's Commercial Daily recently criticized the War Production Board, saying:</p>
<p>"Since the establishment of the War Production Board and the appointment of Weng Wenhao as director, considerable time has passed, but the concrete and fundamental guidelines for increasing production have yet to be determined, causing producers to feel disappointed. The Production Board has not only failed to assist producers, but it has also not held a single meeting to date."</p>
<p>This is indeed the truth - in fact, one could understand this from the very beginning. Why do I say this? Because Nelson's plan is undoubtedly focused on the post-war period, just as the Christian Science Monitor pointed out, and did not consider immediately making "China a large arsenal for freedom-loving nations" or similar things. The War Production Board was fundamentally established as a cornerstone for the United States to completely colonize China. The task that the United States intends to impose on Chongqing in carrying out the war against Japan is nothing more than the arbitrary use of China's vast human resources and its geographical conditions as a base for attacks against Japan. The United States' eagerness to mediate cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists also stems from this. As for the establishment of the War Production Board, its main expected effect at present is to boost the morale of the people of Chongqing. Regarding this point, Nelson states as follows:</p>
<p>"The establishment of the Chinese War Production Board and the arrival of technical delegates has had a direct effect on the Chinese people's will to fight."</p>
<p>In other words, no matter how much fanfare the propaganda makes, the contribution of Chongqing's War Production Board to the war of resistance, from an economic point of view, is simply negligible. This point has also been admitted by the Nelson-Halleck report itself. In short, it is not a "wartime" production board at all, but at most a "post-war" production board.</p>
<p>The Nelson-Halleck report concludes by saying:</p>
<p>If the attempt to promote China's planned wartime production succeeds, the economic relationship between China and the United States will become closer after the war. China has the possibility and hope of developing its domestic industries with the help of the United States.</p>
<p>"If such assistance is realistic, it must be built on a sound commercial basis. After the war, China will replace Japan as the leading industrial nation in the Far East. At that time, a large-scale market will be progressively opened up for American export industries."</p>
<p>This is indeed a straightforward conclusion and a far-reaching plan! Halleck in politics and Wedemeyer in military affairs have been working hard to subordinate Chongqing completely to the United States, while Nelson grasps it in economics, thereby laying the foundation for political and military subordination to the United States. If his plan succeeds, then post-war China will be completely transformed into an American colony. At that time, not only the vast population of China, but even the various peoples of the entire Far East, will become the targets of the harsh exploitation of gold-dollar capital. And American commerce will obtain unlimited profits from the "progressively opened" Far Eastern market at its monopolistic prices. However, this is of course just a one-sided "ambition" of Wall Street, a more fitting pipe dream. The Nelson-Halleck report has automatically and blatantly exposed this kind of ambition and dream. This is good propaganda material for Japan, which is fighting for the liberation of the East Asian peoples, and also realistically exposes the hideous face of the United States towards Chongqing and the various peoples of East Asia. In this sense, we express our deep gratitude to Roosevelt for publicly releasing this report!</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Strengthening Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Shanghai's industrial and commercial organizations, known as trade associations, have a long history. Since the National Government formulated the "Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations" in March of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), various industries have reorganized their associations. Currently, there are over 200 trade associations established with the approval of the Bureau of Economic Affairs. These associations naturally hold extremely important positions within Shanghai's economic organization.</p>
<p>According to Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations, the task of trade associations is clearly defined as: "Industrial and commercial trade associations are established to assist the government in implementing economic policies and to enhance the common interests of the industry." In normal times, they assist the government in implementing economic measures; in wartime, they should especially take on the task of promoting wartime economic policies. In terms of wartime economic tasks, they are doubly important compared to peacetime. This is because modern warfare is a total war competition, and the economy is an important sector in the total war. In principle, it is necessary to ensure that the people have a minimum level of stable economic life before contributing all economic power to enrich war resources. Therefore, industry and commerce should each fulfill their tasks based on their respective positions in the economic sector. Trade associations are organizations that unite various industries, so as to generate collective power and accomplish a common mission.</p>
<p>With the establishment of the National General Association of Commercial Control, the collective self-governance nature of commerce began to implement a controlled economy. Its grassroots organization is also the trade association, and therefore the task of the trade association is even more important. To fulfill their responsibilities for wartime and controlled economies, strengthening their organization and work is even more necessary. However, the reorganization of various industry associations in this city has been ongoing for two years. From an objective review, we believe that they have not achieved the expected results. We would like to offer the following suggestions for future improvements:</p>
<p>(1) Strengthen trade association organizations and merge trade associations of similar nature. Industrial classifications need not be too detailed; they should be simplified as much as possible. This is because if there are not many businesses in a specific industry, forming separate associations will only disperse power and increase expenses.</p>
<p>(2) Although trade association leaders are elected, they must be reviewed by the relevant authorities to prevent unscrupulous elements from exploiting and controlling the association. The primary condition should be that they are trusted by the people in the industry. After assuming a position in the association, it should be regarded as actual work, aiming to seek benefits for the industry.</p>
<p>(3) Trade associations should regularly supervise the business policies of their members. If hoarding or profiteering is discovered, it should be corrected immediately. Only those within the industry are most aware of industry trends.</p>
<p>(4) The relevant authorities should pay close attention to the dynamics of trade associations, establishing contact with the leaders of various trade associations at all times to announce government policies, and also to supervise active work to prevent the formation of idle groups.</p>
<p>(5) Any price increases in various industries must be justified by the trade association and submitted to the relevant authorities for approval. Arbitrary or individual price increases are not allowed.</p>
<p>(6) After the trade association organization is sound, it can generate collective power. When members have requests or encounter difficulties, they can appeal to the relevant authorities according to law, which will naturally be valued by the authorities.</p>
<p>(7) Trade associations are by no means profit-sharing groups. The interests of the industry are their own interests. They must never exploit the interests of members or impose excessive demands on them under false pretenses.</p>
<p>In short, strengthening trade associations has a great effect on suppressing prices and preventing hoarding, which benefits the wartime and controlled economies. This need not be reiterated. Now that the city's economic authorities are working to refresh economic administration, it is an important task worth promoting. Attention should be paid to it.</p>

<h3>City Finance Bureau Implements Organizational Adjustments, Further Enhancing the Efficiency of City Finances</h3>
<p>Since Secretary-General Luo took office, the Municipal Finance Bureau has spared no effort in adjusting municipal finances. Recently, it has again reformed its internal organization, adding a Business Tax Section, a Special Consumption Tax Section, a Property and Land Tax Section, an Accounting Section, a Treasury Section, and an Inspection Section, starting yesterday. The original Special Consumption Tax Office was deemed too large, so it was abolished. At the same time, in order to prevent malfeasance, such as corruption by tax collectors and tax evasion by merchants, a Inspection Section was added. It is expected that the efficiency of municipal finances will be further enhanced in the future. The Central News Agency reporter has investigated the internal work of the main sections of the Finance Bureau, as follows:</p>
<p>Adjustment of Internal Organization and Structure</p>
<p>(1) The Business Tax Section has already started collecting the Business Tax for the spring season of this year in the old 1st and 2nd districts on February 1st. (2) The abolition of the Special Consumption Tax Office and the establishment of the Special Consumption Tax Section has also begun. (3) The former Property Tax and Land Tax Sections are now combined into a single Property and Land Tax Section, starting today, for easier unified management. (4) The original Collection and Investigation Section has been abolished, and its work will now be handled by the various responsible sections. (5) The abolition of the Municipal General Accounting Office, with the Finance Bureau establishing a dedicated Accounting Section. (6) The unification and merger of the old 1st and 2nd district treasuries and the Municipal Treasury into a single Treasury, with the Finance Bureau establishing a Treasury Section, which was formally established yesterday. (7) The new Inspection Section is responsible for: (A) Investigating and reporting merchants evading or漏税漏稅. (B) Adjusting and reporting illegal activities of financial administrative tax personnel. In order to ensure meticulous internal organization, fewer personnel are hired, but with greater authority, to facilitate their reporting and adjustment tasks. All personnel recruited for the Inspection Section are rigorously selected and sworn to be loyal to their service. If any personnel in the Inspection Section themselves engage in corruption, they will be severely punished. (8) A new Financial Research Committee has been established, with three to five members, and Director-General Luo serving as the chairman of the committee. (Further details) In order to adapt to the organizational structure, the Finance Bureau has made slight adjustments to personnel, as follows: Chief of the Secretariat Xu Songping, Secretaries Shen Zhenxu, Cai Yanbin, Zhuang Wei. Chief of the General Affairs Section Zhu Wenlong, Chief of the Land Tax Section Qiu Tianfang, Assistant Hao Zhuowu, Chief of the Business Tax Section Lu Jiqing, Assistant Liao Yicun, Chief of the Property and Land Tax Section Dai Dunhua, Assistant Shi Hua, Chief of the License Section Bao Zuyi, Assistant Yao Wenxian, Chief of the Special Consumption Tax Section Chen Junde, Assistant Li Zhongyuan, Chief of the Accounting Section Li Baichuan, Assistant Yun Caiwu, Chief of the Treasury Section Chen Yunqing, Chief of the Inspection Section Qin Tinggui, Specialists Wang Shanqing, Wu Yongming (relieved of original post), Liu Ding (concurrently Director of Valuation at the Property and Land Tax Section), and Wang Jisheng is also appointed as the Chief of the Personnel Unit of the General Affairs Section, Yang Xiaofo is appointed as the Head of the License Section of the Madang Road Office, Tang Jiqing is also appointed as the Director of the Madang Road Office, and Zheng Deheng is the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Ma Chang Road Office.</p>
<p>Director-General Luo Delivers Instructions</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau held a bureau affairs meeting yesterday (1st) morning at 11:00 AM, presided over by Director-General Luo himself. All section heads and assistants and above participated. Director-General Luo delivered instructions on the spot, providing many valuable guidelines on the reform plan for finance, and reported on the adjustment of the financial organization. Director-General Luo's instructions were as follows: (1) I come from a staff background and understand the situation of staff members, and the necessary conditions for their work: First, be loyal to your superiors; second, have meticulous planning and careful thinking, and share the worries of your superiors. I am both the Chief of Staff of the Municipal Government and a "responsible person". I am determined to work with the spirit of "going to hell", regardless of new or old, thinking about things. This time, in order to adapt to the organization, there have been personnel adjustments. I hope that everyone can work together with a fighting spirit. (2) The place where we are now working was left behind by Anglo-American imperialism. Recalling the humiliation we have suffered for more than a hundred years, we should strive to correct the habits of following old ways and eliminate past malpractices to comfort our ancestors. (3) The Municipal Government's finances must take the initiative to adapt. The implementation of wartime municipal administration requires huge project funds, and the increase in the salaries of general service personnel also requires considerable funding. The Finance Bureau is responsible for planning, and there are two methods: First, rectify old taxes, in addition to eliminating corruption, strictly crack down on tax evasion; second, open up new taxes, such as the Business Tax in the former first and eighth districts, etc., which should have been implemented but were not. The rest is to increase tax rates, such as the Special Tax on Goods Sold Separately, which has been increased from 4% to 5% starting today (1st), and so on. There were many words of encouragement, ending with: "I deeply believe that if we can mobilize" all personnel, we will definitely achieve considerable results."</p>
<p>Spring Business Tax to Be Collected Starting Today</p>
<p>In addition to the ordinary special consumption tax, various tax revenues of the Municipal Finance Bureau have been increased from 4% to 5% starting today. The Spring Business Tax for the old first and eighth districts will begin collection on February 1st. In order to handle the collection of the Business Tax, the Finance Bureau has newly established a Business Tax Section. The recruitment of collectors will be done in an open manner, selecting and employing suitable talents to serve in the old first and eighth districts.</p>

<h3>Su, Director of the Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau, Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Municipal Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau, Mr. Su Chengde, officially went to the bureau yesterday (1st) to take office. The new Director Su and his entourage arrived at the bureau at 9:00 AM. The former concurrent Director Xiong had arrived at the bureau to lead senior staff in welcoming him into the director's office to handle the handover of the new and the old. The Municipal Government specially sent Secretary Zheng Panpan to preside over the inauguration ceremony. After 10:00 AM, the heads of various agencies in the city and guests from all walks of life came to congratulate him, with no less than 200 people. Director Su received them with tea and refreshments in the conference room. At 11:45 AM, Director Su specially summoned all personnel in the bureau to speak in the conference room, with many words of encouragement. At noon, he met with reporters and delivered an inaugural speech. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inaugural Speech</p>
<p>After taking office, Director Su spoke to all personnel in the bureau as follows: "I have been ordered to be transferred to serve as the Director of the Municipal Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau. I am very happy to meet you all for the first time today. In the past, most of my work has been in the nature of police work, previously in the capital and recently in this city. Now the Mayor wants me to take on the clearing work in the districts of this city. My personal ability is limited, and I am afraid that I will not be able to fulfill the task. However, I think that the police are to maintain public order, and the purpose of clearing is to seek the establishment of public order. The nature of the work is mutually linked, so I dare to boldly try to take on this arduous task.</p>
<p>The clearing work in this city, under the leadership of former Acting Chairman Chen, and last year with the continued implementation by the concurrent Director Xiong, has already had a very good foundation and complete regulations. Most of you have been serving here for a long time and are very experienced. I am able to be in this good environment and take on the responsibility of clearing the city with you all. I will naturally implement, develop, and promote the original plan and the existing achievements. You should also continue to help me with the spirit of past efforts. I believe that the work will definitely be satisfactory and will not disappoint the appointment of the superiors and the expectations of the local people.</p>
<p>Previously, the late Chairman Wang showed us that "clearing must first clear the heart." Recently, Mayor Zhou instructed when taking office: "Public interest is more important than private interest, society comes before the individual." I think that those who are responsible for clearing work should especially take the above instructions as the highest guideline for our work, and step by step with the spirit of hard work, practical work, and tough work, to build a clean government and seek happiness for the local area. I have always taken the cause as the premise, and will not make many adjustments to personnel due to the handover of new and old officials, so that work efficiency can be increased through familiarity. Therefore, I hope that you can work with peace of mind, and be more determined and more diligent to work together to promote the great cause of clearing.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the treatment of colleagues, the Mayor has recently been trying to improve the salaries and rations of public officials belonging to the Municipal Government. I am determined to do my best to convey the living conditions of my colleagues in this bureau to the Changju and strive for improvement.</p>
<p>Today, because time is limited, there will be more opportunities to meet and talk in the future. I would like to propose the above points for your consideration.</p>

<h3>University Alumni Advancement Association: Regularly Holds Arts and Entertainment Gatherings, Sponsors This Newspaper's Special Fundraising</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper initiated the "Special Fundraising," it has been enthusiastically supported by well-meaning people from all walks of life. However, due to the large amount needed, it has been impossible to achieve the predetermined goals. Various schools and youth groups in Shanghai have provided various forms of assistance, for which we are deeply grateful. Now, the University Alumni Advancement Association, a social welfare and academic group automatically organized by university students in Shanghai, in order to respond to this newspaper's educational assistance campaign, has specially joined with alumni to initiate and organize a grand arts and entertainment gathering. The performance will feature drama, Peking opera, film stars, singing, and musical accompaniment. It is scheduled to be staged at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater at 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month. Since it is purely charitable in nature, a grand occasion is expected at that time. Recently, the students have been working hard to solicit donations, and have designated the Chung Yuen Bank, the Dunta Mor Hotel, and the association's location on Jiujiang Road as donation collection points. They have been actively preparing these days, and the work is progressing, showing how busy they are. It is reported that the association will hold a meeting of all executive members at 2:00 PM on the 4th of this month to promote the efficiency of the educational assistance campaign.</p>
