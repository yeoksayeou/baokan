<h3>本月三十日以前　國軍由空運到京　何總司令囑令井轉告準備一切</h3>
<p>芷江二十三日電　留此五十一小時之日投降代表今井等一行八人，今日午後離芷飛南京覆命。何總司令部午後一時半接見今井，由陳少校引導，自住所乘懸掛白旗之吉普車來總部晋見，何總司令接見今井，係在總司令會客室內。何總司令立於辦公桌後，參謀長蕭毅肅，副參謀長冷欣·蔡文智，美軍作戰司令部參謀長柏德諾及鈕先銘處長五人，立于何氏之後，新聞記者僅中央社記者及美記者各一人在塲。一時二十五分今井等乘車至總部門前下車後，由陳少校引導，循長凡百米之　道，緩步進至何總司令辦公　門外，經陳少校報吿後，何總司令即傳見，日方　員及隨從參　兩人則佇立門口。今井仍穿戎　佩刀，脫帽後步入，默然肅立，向何總司令鞠躬敬禮，何總司令即問今井，「前日下午三時蕭參謀長面交第一號備忘錄，貴官瞭解否？」今井點首答稱，「收到了。」何總司令又問，「後來我又派員面交三件備忘錄，你都收到了嗎？」今井答曰，「收到了」。於是何總司令鄭重囑咐今井稱，「我巳決定貴官仍乘原機飛往南京，希望貴官轉告岡村寗次將軍對於前後四項備忘錄切實照辦」，今井毫未猶豫答稱，「一定轉達到，關於備忘錄之內容，於總司令部奉到東京大本營命令，即可決定。」何總司令續稱，「本總司令巳決定於本月二十六日以後三十日以前，開始空運部隊至南京，望貴官轉吿岡村寗次將軍準備一切，」今井鞠躬答曰「是，知道了」。最後何總司令宣稱，「今日談話到此爲止，貴官現在可準備出發了」，今井聆悉後，深深一鞠躬而退，何氏曾起身示答。今日何總司令接見今井，談話　時九分半鐘。日本代表來芷向我接洽投降事，自此吿一初步段落。</p>
<p>今井代表離芷一瞥</p>
<p>芷江二十三日電　今井少將晋謁何總司令後，即乘　住所摒擋發行李，準備飛返南京，此訊傳出後，芷江人民佇立馬路，咸欲再度一觀此代表日方洽降專使之面目。美軍方面亦均駐軍至機塲參觀日機，中外記者亦趕往機塲紛紛攝影。機塲戒備森嚴，不准接近日機，雖中美憲兵限制極　，而攝影記者仍不願放棄此難得之機會。二時五分，今井等所乘飛機，始滑行至跑道，徐徐上昇，我野馬式飛機六架已在上空盤旋甚久，候其上昇，護送到常德一帶。</p>
<h3>蔣主席蒞國府　隆重簽署憲章</h3>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>迎吳副市長</h3>
<p>本市副市長　紹澍氏，偕同黨政軍各機關高級人負，業於昨日蒞滬。到站歡迎者除各界代表外，更有廣大民衆，具見吳氏聲　，巳在一般市民信仰之中。我們也站在市民立塲，敬致歡迎之忱。</p>
<p>吳副市長畏在滬工作，巳有七八年，其間艱辛歷盡，困苦備黨，設身處地，我們不難想像出一幅熱血交織的奮鬥圖面。如今勝利完成，河山光復，吳氏奉命輔弼市政，重蒞斯土，更設身處地的推想，又不難泛現一幅光榮氣概的圖面。自古歷史上凱旋班師，受人歡迎的光榮，今吳氏可以　之，即此巳足　答八年苦鬥的辛勞了。</p>
<p>我們在今日，固常以最高的熱忱歡迎吳氏，以酧過去功績；但更以最股切的然忱期待吳氏，盼爲今後滬市市政創一新的史頁。</p>
<p>目前市政機關尙未全面接收，以　　進市政，尙須稍待。不過，在準備工作方面，似應積極籌備，預爲之計。我們認爲今後市政工作，可分三個步驟，第一步驟是接收，第二步驟是整理，第三步驟是改造。因此，在第一步驟尙未辦理之時，驟言改進，不免過早。而接收以後，未經整理步驟，則改進無所依據。所以，今天應先考　的是怎樣接收？怎樣整理？</p>
<p>自從日本接接投降以後，中央各機關陸續到滬，展開工作，頗爲熱烈，可是，機關紛立，其間不免有步調不一，措　紛歧的現象。七八年來，滬市市民久未受中央政府機關的直接管理，所謂：「士別三日，刮目相看」，都有極誠　的愛護與期待，愛之深期之切原是事理之常，而綜觀旬日間的動熊，我們在街頭巷尾，不時聽到一致的批評。我們認爲這種批評，都是出於本誠的善意，似有聽取考慮的必要。</p>
<p>日前　蔣委員長駐滬代表公署巳經發出　吿，爲取得聯絡，請中央及各方面在滬機關函報該署轉報中央備查。軍委會何宣導委員也表示健全宜導機關。現在吳副市長又巳蒞滬，主持一切，我們相信必能促使步調一致，增厚力量。</p>
<p>吳氏身兼本市黨政，軍要職，才具練達，久爲市民所信仰，昨天蒞滬首次談話，即以「嗣後自應力謀安定社會秩序，解除民衆痛」爲念。我們於敬表歡迎之餘，並致期待之忱。</p>
<h3>宋院長將飛倫敦　商香港地位問題　美建議五國外長會議延期舉行</h3>
<p>華盛頓二十三日路透社電　宋院長已展緩返國之行，並擬於下週初飛倫敦，聞香港問題將爲其與英政府最先商討之事。美國務卿貝爾納斯本日於記者招待會中，拒絕評論或概括說明美國對香港未來地位之態度。渠稱，此乃一必須由有關國家籍條約解決之領土問題，此一問題可能於五國外長會議中提出討論。國務卿述及盟國管制並佔領日本之計劃稱，美國務院及陸海軍部刻順利進行討論，渠對迄今所獲之發展表示滿意</p>

<h3>切忌紊亂</h3>
<p>— 成</p>
<p>紊亂現象，是無組織無系統無秩序的結果，　一盤　　的表現。</p>
<p>個人行動紊亂了，個人招致不良的後果；團體行動紊亂了，團體招致不良的後果；社會以至國家莫不如此。</p>
<p>所以，無論個人·團體·社會·以至國家的一切行動，　須有組織，有系統，有秩序，然後才能獲得優良的後果。</p>
<p>尤其在時局波動的非常時期，一切未上軌道，更當謹守組織，系統，秩序的法則，彼此統一，上下一致，爲達成共同目標，爲爭取前途光明，切忌各自爲政，而陷於紊亂的現象。</p>
<h3>刦後自勵</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>無名小卒的我，在八年前故鄉的圍城中，竟然沒有死於「友軍」的轟炸，砲火，和刺刀之下；現在又公然從機槍炸彈的嚴重威脅下無恙而出，眞的，當和平消息證實的那一夜，我是多麼興奮，多麼深自慶幸的躺在床上輾轉反側而不能入眠啊！於是不期然而然的有一個問句蒼蠅般趕掉復來的在我耳根旁不斷總繞：「我將來作什麼？……」</p>
<p>在回答這一個頗不易應付的問題以前，思潮又驅迫着我不能不作一下反省。</p>
<p>猶憶六年前　居在這還可稱爲一片乾淨土的上海孤島的時候，由於環境的特殊，深恐有所隕越對不住自己的良心，於是拈出「規律的生活，嚴謹的行爲，高尚的思想，犧牲的精神」四語，以爲自己的座右銘，以爲自己行事的準繩。最初幾年，我兢兢業業，時加警惕，對於自己的約言總還算儘可能履行了；然而最近一年以來，我是多麼消極，多麼　唐，竟把以前的定志拋到九霄雲外了啊！平常「工作如牛」的我，竟一變而懈怠的等於罷工了！但是我又有什麼力量同這殘酷的現實抗爭呢？每提筆想寫一點東西，每進圖書館想翻　一點材料，那「我這一次是不是會作戰神的犧牲」一個問句，就渾如冷水淋頭的呌我頹然而止。最近心理尤爲惡劣，眞呌人時時生「明日是否還在」的感想。於是在正課之餘，我祇好埋頭在小說　中，我是怎樣的浪費了我的光陰啊！</p>
<p>現在旣然　天之幸成了「刧後餘生」的一員，我要怎樣去好好利用這所餘下的生命呢？我用什麼去供獻給這一定要走上復興大道的祖國呢？我有什麼去供獻給這一定要奔向建設之途的社會呢？我又要怎樣去迎接這光明時代的來臨？說來我惶恐，又慚愧；我是赤手空拳一無所有，我祇有一顆痛改前非和以後努力好好工作的決心。我立定志向必須努力從事於對人類社會有利益的工作，不斷拓展？</p>
<p>我舊事重提的把六年前所拈出而稍涉空洞的銘言，修改成如下的四句：「規律的生活，嚴謹的行爲，益世的工作，克已的精神」。</p>

        <h1>1945.08.24</h1>
<h3>Before the 30th of This Month, National Army to be Airlifted to the Capital; Commander-in-Chief He Instructs Jing to Relay and Prepare Everything</h3>
<p>Zhijiang, 23rd—The Japanese surrender delegation, including Imai, who stayed here for fifty-one hours, left Zhijiang by plane this afternoon to report back to Nanjing. Commander-in-Chief He's headquarters received Imai at 1:30 PM. Guided by Major Chen, Imai arrived at the headquarters from his residence in a jeep displaying a white flag to meet Commander-in-Chief He in the reception room. Commander-in-Chief He stood behind his desk, with Chief of Staff Xiao Yisu, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Leng Xin and Cai Wenzhi, U.S. Military Operations Command Chief of Staff Brigadier General Patnode, and Director Niu Xianming standing behind He. Only a Central News Agency reporter and an American reporter were present. At 1:25 PM, Imai and his party arrived by car at the headquarters gate. Led by Major Chen, they walked slowly along a path of about one hundred meters to the door of Commander-in-Chief He's office. After Major Chen reported, Commander-in-Chief He summoned Imai. The Japanese staff and two accompanying adjutants stood at the door. Imai, still wearing his military uniform and sword, took off his hat and entered, standing silently and bowing to Commander-in-Chief He. Commander-in-Chief He immediately asked Imai, "Did you understand the Memorandum No. 1 that Chief of Staff Xiao handed to you on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 3 PM?" Imai nodded and replied, "I received it." Commander-in-Chief He then asked, "Later, I sent someone to hand you three more memorandums. Did you receive them all?" Imai replied, "I received them." Then Commander-in-Chief He solemnly instructed Imai, "I have decided that you should return to Nanjing by the same plane. I hope you will relay to General Yasuji Okamura to strictly abide by the four memorandums." Imai replied without hesitation, "I will definitely relay it. Regarding the content of the memorandums, a decision can be made after the headquarters receives orders from the Tokyo General Headquarters." Commander-in-Chief He continued, "This headquarters has decided to begin airlifting troops to Nanjing between the 26th and 30th of this month. I hope you will relay this to General Yasuji Okamura to prepare everything." Imai bowed and replied, "Yes, I understand." Finally, Commander-in-Chief He declared, "This concludes today's discussion. You can now prepare to depart." After hearing this, Imai bowed deeply and withdrew. Commander-in-Chief He rose to acknowledge. Commander-in-Chief He's meeting with Imai lasted nine and a half minutes. The arrival of the Japanese representative to Zhijiang to negotiate surrender has thus come to a preliminary conclusion.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Representative Imai Leaving Zhijiang</p>
<p>Zhijiang, 23rd—After Major General Imai met with Commander-in-Chief He, he immediately returned to his residence to pack his luggage in preparation for his flight back to Nanjing. After this news spread, the people of Zhijiang stood by the roadside, all wanting to see the face of this special Japanese envoy for surrender negotiations again. The American military also stationed troops at the airport to view the Japanese plane, and Chinese and foreign reporters also rushed to the airport to take photos. Security at the airport was tight, and access to the Japanese plane was prohibited. Although the Chinese and American military police restricted it greatly, the photographers were still unwilling to give up this rare opportunity. At 2:05 PM, the plane carrying Imai and his party began to taxi to the runway and slowly ascended. Six P-51 Mustang fighters had been circling in the sky for a long time, waiting for it to ascend to escort it to the Changde area.</p>

The spirit of the Charter is not only to seek the improvement of relations between countries, but also to seek the improvement of relations between people within a country.</p>
<p>Chongqing Central News Agency, 23rd—According to a Washington telegram from the U.S. Information Service on the 32nd, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace stated that with the ratification of the world charter by the United States, China, and the Soviet Union, the world security mechanism is nearing completion. These five countries have now accepted their international responsibilities. All countries, large and small, around the world should be pleased with how to effectively implement the work of maintaining world peace. We are now only entering the preparatory stage, and there is still much work to be done. Since the United States, China, and the Soviet Union have ratified it, the three countries have already recognized the rights of men and women. Other countries will soon ratify the Charter, and the organization of the United Nations will begin to work.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Welcoming Vice Mayor Wu</h3>
<p>The Deputy Mayor of this city, Wu Shaoshu, along with senior officials from party, government, and military agencies, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. In addition to representatives from all walks of life, a large number of citizens were at the station to welcome him, showing that Wu's reputation has been trusted by the general public. We also stand on the side of the citizens to express our sincere welcome.</p>
<p>Vice Mayor Wu has worked in Shanghai for seven or eight years, during which he has experienced countless hardships and difficulties. Putting ourselves in his shoes, it is not difficult for us to imagine a picture of struggle intertwined with hot blood. Now that victory has been achieved and the country has been restored, Wu has been ordered to assist in municipal administration and return to this land. Putting ourselves in his shoes again, it is not difficult for us to see a picture of glorious spirit. Since ancient times, the glory of a triumphant return and being welcomed has been something Wu can now enjoy, which is enough to repay the hardships of eight years of struggle.</p>
<p>Today, we not only welcome Wu with the highest enthusiasm to reward his past achievements, but also look forward to him with the most sincere enthusiasm, hoping that he will create a new historical page for Shanghai's municipal administration in the future.</p>
<p>At present, the municipal agencies have not yet fully taken over, and further progress in municipal administration will have to wait. However, it seems that active preparations and advance planning should be made in terms of preparatory work. We believe that future municipal work can be divided into three steps: the first step is takeover, the second step is consolidation, and the third step is transformation. Therefore, it would be premature to talk about improvement before the first step has been completed. And without the consolidation step after the takeover, there would be no basis for improvement. Therefore, what should be considered today is how to take over and how to consolidate.</p>
<p>Since Japan accepted the surrender, various central agencies have successively arrived in Shanghai and started working with great enthusiasm. However, with the establishment of many agencies, there are bound to be inconsistencies in pace and differences in measures. For the past seven or eight years, the citizens of Shanghai have not been directly managed by the central government agencies. The saying "A scholar who has been away for three days should be looked at with new eyes" reflects the sincere care and expectations of the people. Loving deeply and expecting earnestly are common sense, and looking at the trends of the past ten days, we often hear consistent criticisms in the streets and alleys. We believe that these criticisms are all based on sincere goodwill and should be listened to and considered.</p>
<p>Recently, the Office of Chairman Chiang's Representative in Shanghai has issued a notice requesting that the central and various other agencies in Shanghai report to the office for forwarding to the central government for reference in order to establish contact. Committee member He of the Military Affairs Commission also expressed the need to improve the guidance agencies. Now that Vice Mayor Wu has arrived in Shanghai to preside over everything, we believe that he will be able to promote a unified pace and strengthen the power.</p>
<p>Wu holds important party, government, and military positions in this city, and his talents have long been trusted by the citizens. In his first speech upon arriving in Shanghai yesterday, he stated that his priority would be to "strive to stabilize social order and relieve the suffering of the people." While expressing our respect and welcome, we also extend our sincere expectations.</p>

Most of the fatalities were due to the effects of the atomic bomb on the human body. Those who were burned could not be treated, and even those who were only slightly burned were initially in good spirits, but for some reason, they weakened and died after a few days. The explosion area of the atomic bomb reached 18.7 square miles, with a radius of 20 kilometers. All houses were either blown up and collapsed or burned down. The number of dead bodies is even more difficult to calculate. The shock wave caused by the explosion immediately lasted for ten minutes, and its power was truly terrifying.</p>

<h3>Factories and Mines in Recovered Areas Must Not Be Destroyed</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 23rd—Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao issued a statement yesterday regarding the handling of recovered industrial and mining enterprises. He said that the central government has decided on the methods for handling the recovery of industrial and mining enterprises in various recovered areas, and offices will be set up in various districts to supervise the takeover. The assets previously occupied by foreigners will be seriously reorganized to ensure the preservation of the foundation of the enterprises. However, it has recently been heard that some people are privately moving and occupying them during this period, which may lead to the loss of important equipment, which is inappropriate. It is hoped that the industrial and mining enterprises in various recovered areas will properly preserve their assets and equipment before the official takeover and not privately move or alter them.

<p>Grand Welcoming Scene</p>
<p>Yesterday around 1:00 PM, the public near the North Station, having heard the news, reached over ten thousand people. Comrades from the Youth Corps, wearing their badges, maintained order at the station, creating an unprecedentedly warm scene. At 1:37 PM, the special train entered the station. Welcoming personnel waved flags. Mr. Wu, wearing a light gray Western suit, immediately disembarked with over thirty staff members.

Today, I am able to meet you all publicly, and I am very excited. The people of this city have endured hardship for many years, and the government authorities and I deeply sympathize with them. Now that the war is over and we have seen the light of day again, we must strive to stabilize social order and relieve the suffering of the people. I hope the people of this city will diligently return to their posts. As for how to develop the reconstruction work of this city in the future, it will be actively carried out under the guidance of Representative Jiang Bocheng.

<h3>Special Economic Investigation Work in the Southeastern Region. Strict Prohibition of Illegal Acquisition and Transfer of Materials</h3>
<p>The Special Economic Investigation Division of the Central Committee's Investigation and Statistics Bureau, under orders to investigate the special economy of the southeastern region, has established an office at 735 Foch Road in this city by Commissioner Fang Qinghe of the Southeastern Region. It has formally announced its official opening and is actively conducting special economic investigation affairs, with internal divisions for general affairs, investigation, and action. The first step is to conduct special economic investigations into the main materials seized by Japan in the past, the factories and businesses established, the content of their operations, and the business operations of the Sino-Japanese Chamber of Commerce. This is the most important work of the special economic investigation. In particular, as Japan has accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered to our United Nations, it is inevitable that Japanese soldiers and civilians leaving Shanghai will collude with ignorant merchants to steal and sell goods. A detailed investigation is necessary. If there are ignorant merchants who, blinded by greed, secretly purchase materials seized by the Japanese, citizens are encouraged to report them. There will be strict punishment without leniency. All compatriots must not collude with Japanese merchants and Japanese military authorities to steal and sell military and economic materials related to the people's livelihood. If there is any of the above, whether directly or indirectly, it will be considered aiding the enemy. Pay attention to the illegal transfer of various materials at any time. Investigate the locations of warehouses left by the Japanese in various places. At an appropriate time, report to the authorities there. It is learned that the office has detailed information on past actions of merchants in the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors who have aided the enemy, hoarded goods, or made exorbitant profits. Subsequent investigations will provide concrete evidence, and they will also be reported to the government for sanctions.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the main internal personnel are as follows: Su Mao, Head of the General Affairs Group; Wang Yuanyang, Head of the Investigation Group; , Head of the Action Group; Geng Yan, Deputy Head.</p>
<h3>Staff Officer Zhang of the Third War Area Headquarters Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

Mr. Zhang arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM and is working at the headquarters' Shanghai Liaison Station on Taishan Road.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Comfort Items and Famous Broadcast Songs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps, in conjunction with the Allied Nations Central Camp Overseas Chinese Reception Committee, is actively promoting the work of the Allied Nations Central Camp Overseas Chinese. Recently, a large-scale campaign has been launched. Shanghai's famous singers will be broadcasting popular songs every evening from August 25th on the Shanghai Broadcasting Association radio station, frequency 900, for one week. It is hoped that generous people from all walks of life will donate generously, and it is certain that there will be a lively atmosphere.

<h3>Committee Member He Makes a Speech: Hopes for Joint Efforts in Publicity Work</h3>
<p>Military Commission Publicity Committee Member He Minhun was ordered a year ago to carry out counter-insurgency work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas. He came to Shanghai a few days ago. The reporter made a special visit to Mr. He yesterday. He gave a speech as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. He's Speech</p>
<p>"A year ago, I was ordered to go to the occupied areas to engage in counter-insurgency work to coordinate with the general counter-offensive. Later, I was ordered to serve as a publicity committee member, responsible for military, political, party, cultural, and economic aspects of counter-insurgency work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas, conveying the Central Committee's intentions, so that they would respond to military actions during the general counter-offensive. Therefore, I paid particular attention to the military aspects. Later, due to the rapid change in the international situation, Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, and I publicly established an organization. Furthermore, the situation in Nanjing was quite tense, so I personally went to consult with relevant parties in Jiangsu and Anhui to handle the matter. All work was satisfactory. This time, I came to Shanghai mainly to visit Mr. Jiang Bocheng to discuss work and improve the publicity organization, and to closely connect with the staff sent by the Central Committee. In terms of work, it is especially necessary to closely cooperate with the Party Headquarters. I have always advocated doing more work, enduring more hardships, humbly accepting opinions from all sides, and strictly guiding the will of Chairman Jiang to promote all work. As for those outside who go to various places to take over under similar names, I cannot be responsible for others, nor can I bear the blame for others. As for the handling of three or four cultural groups, due to procedural and technical issues that could not be , they have been corrected separately and will be successively handed over to the competent authorities. The Publicity Committee has established a temporary office in Shanghai to coordinate work with Nanjing and other areas. I hope that capable people in this city will work together and cooperate with the publicity plan so that all the people of the city can understand Chairman Jiang's concern for the locality. Because the progress of the work cannot be promoted by one organization and a few staff members, the gentry and people of the entire region must work together to ensure smooth progress."</p>
<h3>Zheng Lie to Take Over Judicial Organs in Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>The National Government has ordered Zheng Lie, former Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Procuratorate, to take charge of the judicial organs in Nanjing and Shanghai. He will come to Shanghai from Chongqing as soon as possible to take over the judicial organs in Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>City Party Committee Member Qian Jianqiu Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Legal scholar Dr. Qian Jianqiu devoted himself to party and government work during the eight-year War of Resistance, working tirelessly. Later, he was elected as an executive committee member and director of the women's department of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters. This spring, he secretly traveled to Chongqing under a secret order from the Central Committee to attend the Sixth National Congress. He submitted several reports on the situation of party, government, and women's work in the occupied areas, which were highly valued by the Central Committee. After the congress, he was ordered to inspect southern Anhui and obtained rich information. Now that the war is over, Committee Member Qian returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon by special train with Deputy Mayor Wu Shaoshu. It is heard that he will soon convene a meeting of women leaders from all walks of life in the city to deliver an important speech and discuss plans for the development of women's work.</p>

<h3>Beware of Disorder</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>Disorderly phenomena are the result of a lack of organization, system, and order, a manifestation of utter chaos.</p>
<p>Disorderly individual actions lead to adverse consequences for the individual; disorderly group actions lead to adverse consequences for the group; society and even the nation are no exception.</p>
<p>Therefore, all actions of individuals, groups, society, and even the nation must be organized, systematic, and orderly in order to achieve excellent results.</p>
<p>Especially in extraordinary times of volatile situations, when everything is not yet on track, we should strictly adhere to the principles of organization, system, and order, uniting with each other, aligning from top to bottom, to achieve common goals and strive for a bright future, avoiding acting independently and falling into disorderly phenomena.</p>
<h3>Self-Encouragement After Survival</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>An insignificant person like me, during the siege of my hometown eight years ago, surprisingly did not die from the bombing, artillery fire, or bayonets of "friendly forces." Now, I have emerged unscathed from the grave threat of machine guns and bombs. Truly, on that night when the news of peace was confirmed, I was so excited and deeply relieved that I tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep! Consequently, a question, like a fly chased away only to return, constantly buzzed around my ears: "What will I do in the future?..."</p>
<p>Before answering this rather difficult question, the tide of thought compels me to reflect a little.</p>
<p>I still remember six years ago, living on the isolated island of Shanghai, which could still be called a piece of clean land. Due to the special circumstances, I deeply feared doing anything that would betray my conscience. Therefore, I extracted the four phrases "Disciplined Life, Strict Conduct, Noble Thoughts, Self-Sacrificing Spirit" as my motto and the guiding principle for my actions. In the first few years, I was conscientious and always vigilant, and I fulfilled my self-imposed vows as much as possible. However, in the past year, how passive and sluggish I have been, completely casting aside my previous determination! I, who used to "work like an ox," have transformed into someone as lazy as being on strike! But what power do I have to fight against this cruel reality? Every time I pick up a pen to write something, every time I enter the library to look up some materials, the question, "Will I become a sacrifice to the god of war this time?" is like a bucket of cold water poured on my head, causing me to collapse and stop. Recently, my mental state has been particularly bad, truly making people constantly have the thought of "Will I still be here tomorrow?" Therefore, in addition to my regular studies, I can only bury myself in novels, how much I have wasted my time!</p>
<p>Now that I have, fortunately, become one of the "survivors after the calamity," how should I make good use of the remaining life? What can I offer to the motherland, which must embark on the road of rejuvenation? What can I offer to the society, which must rush towards the path of construction? And how should I welcome the coming of this bright era? Speaking of this, I am apprehensive and ashamed. I am empty-handed and have nothing; I only have a determination to thoroughly correct my past mistakes and work hard in the future. I have made up my mind that I must strive to engage in work that benefits human society, and constantly expand...?</p>
<p>I revisit the old matter and revise the slightly hollow motto I extracted six years ago into the following four sentences: "Disciplined Life, Strict Conduct, Beneficial Work, Self-Restrained Spirit."</p>
