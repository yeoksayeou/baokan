<p>五月一日夜，奧斯陸電台廣播，德國希特勒元首已於是日殉國。這是一個舉世震驚的消息。德國在希特勒元首領導下的反布爾希維克及保衛德國的戰爭，和盟邦領導的反對英美帝國主義的鬥爭，雖然目標和對象不同，但是在建設理想的世界新秩序一點是完全一致的，因此，我們東亞人民對於德元首的殉國，一致表示哀悼之忱。</p>
<p>但是，我們對於希特勒元首之死，決不能因爲哀悼而轉向於對理想事業的悲觀或失望。他的一生，爲愛護祖國改浩世界艱苦奮鬥，始終不懈。第一次世界大戰時，即因愛國心的　使而參加義勇軍，在西綫作戰，二度受傷。及不幸德國戰敗，悲憤莫遏，當時外有帝國主義者的瓜分威脅，內有共產黨徒的革命暴動。他在國家瀕於危亡之際，於一九一九年組織國社黨，幾經艱險，以黨爲基礎，至一九三三年而主國政，使國家轉危爲安，轉弱爲强，終於　得全國的挑護。乃因鋻於英美帝國主義及布爾希維克黨對歐洲及世界的威脅，毅然欲以德國為中心，展開建設世界新秩序的雄謀遠略，爲世人側目。他的政治主張未及完成，竟以身殉國，但其精忠愛國的精神，則常永乖史册。</p>
<p>德國元首之殉國，雖於歐洲整個戰局不無影響，但是我們只要了解德國歷史和日耳曼民族的國民性，就可深信決沒有投隆的德國，決沒有屈膝的日耳曼民族，環境縱使如何艱險，希特勒元首視死如歸的精神，必將爲今後德　領袖和日耳曼民族所務式。現在杜尼資前海軍總司令已繼任德國元首，他在告全國軍民書中已堅決表示「繼續對布爾希維克主義奮鬥，直至德國軍民能獲得不爲奴隸及不遭毀滅之地位爲止」，這正是德國精神的表現。</p>
<p>從德國新元首的廣播中，已可明瞭德國人不問今後戰局的變化到何種程度，決不對敵人屈服，並將用各種有效的方式，堅持對敵人的抗爭。但是，從我們東亞各國反對英美帝國主義侵略的立場來說，更不問歐洲的戰局有什麽變化，都不能對東亞各民族求取生存的決心有任何影響。同時，由於德國人民的決不屈服，由於英美蘇間矛盾的尖銳化，敵人決不能從歐洲轉移兵力到東亞來，而敵人原在東亞的兵力，却已在最近幾次反攻中遭受了嚴重的打擊。我們必須堅定信念，排除任何悲觀動搖的情緒，　力爭取未來的勝利。</p>

<h3 id="c12">從上海到北京 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— 石嶠</p>
<p>從上海到南東的特別怏車，是八點半開的，但七點鐘軋票處已擠滿了人，這天乘客中，仍多爲單帮販，多半在無錫鎭江下車。到南京後，下楊旅舍，翌最過江至浦口，擬乘津浦車繼續北行，乃抵浦口車站，據云淮河橋正在修理，在南京等候四日，南北客車始恢復，乘客之擠，與京滬路無殊。一路平安無事，僅在德州遇空襲警報，亦未見飛機踪跡。自浦口至北平，全程共費四十小時，據路員談，已算很快的了。</p>
<p>久別的故都，依然熙熙攘攘，風景不殊。就人口的密度來說，比事變前還要擁擠，這是戰時的畸形現象，因爲內地不　，殷富之家，多搬至都市居住。華北的物價，亦與華中情形相同，即不斷作週期性上漲，不過華北的物價，一向比舉中低，底盤旣小，所以雖漲而仍比華中低。久住北京的常嘆物價的太高，但是從上海來的人總覺着北京東西便宜。譬如白米，京西稻的品質，與上海近郊的普通薄稻，相差不多，上海雖然接近產米區域，但是米價在十萬左右，北京附近雖然稻田不多，白米每石合成中儲劵價格，不過五萬六千元左右，麵粉雜糧，亦較上海爲低，一般工業品則除棉布外，均較上海爲高，棉布因爲華北產棉，及天津有紡織廠的關係，價格並不高於上海，陰丹士林布每尺零售約一百四十元左右，　中儲劵約八百四十元，這種棉布，花色反較上海爲多，據業中談·近年物價高漲，人民購買力低弱，貨不易銷，所以棉　品不得不從種類花色上競爭。北京馬路上的行人，大多衣衫襤褸，充分表現着人民的貧困。</p>
<p>在北京居住，最便宜的是燃料。白煤塊每噸配給價不過一千二百元，樹柴每斤亦僅二三元。其次爲食物菜蔬。至於洋貨如肥皂·火柴·牙膏·脂粉等物，則均較上海爲貴。據常往來南京的旅客談，北京物價樣樣低，只有金價房租高，金價是隨着天津市價升降的，天津市價，則又跟着上海漲落。因為黃金體積微小，易於私運，所以兩地金價差額很小。</p>
<p>此間常局以金價高漲，足以刺激物價，所以取締金商私抬金價。因爲取締極嚴，所以一般商人均不敢明目張膽的買賣，或作暗語，或作手式，誰也不敢公開的喊行市。最近聽說當局擬限制北京天津兩地金價，最高每兩不得超過七萬元，有無效果，尙須事實證明。因爲金價的蠢動，一般物價也受其影響，三月末的物價，與三月初比較，高起一成左右，華北的物價問題，也是不容忽視的。</p>

<p>東京二日中央社電　爲美國及其與國之俘處及被扣留者輸送救恤品之日輪「阿波丸」，於四月一日午夜在台灣海峽被美國潛水艦擊沉一事，日政府曾立即託瑞士政府要求到美政府之答覆，足見美之態度顯無誠意。二十六日日政府復託駐東京瑞士公使館，向美政府提出最嚴重抗議，並宣言保留應付如此背信行爲之一切必要權利，該抗議書乃詳述「阿波丸」事件之經緯，並斷定美國之背信行爲，實爲「在戰爭歷史上從未有過空前暴舉」。蓋此種行爲乃美國自願放棄在日帝國權力下被俘及被扣留者之等遇問題，日本帝國政府對此種違背人道及國際法根本原則之背信行爲，決澈底追究美政府所負責任。同時因阿波丸之被沉，致使一千數百名和平搭客及載貨，亦與該船同遭滅頂之悲劇，該船爲輸送救恤品與敵國俘虜，其搭客有日外務省鈴木領事及花見通譯官，山名風·杉田　·大東亞省船越理事官·原副領事·新井書記生·岩井　等，上述諸氏與阿波丸同時殉職，恐已確實，其餘搭客中，有因服役南方歸來之竹內大東亞省次官，山田外務省調查局局長，東光大東亞省南方事務局政務課長，保科大東亞大臣秘書官等，此等皆爲輸送救恤品，救濟敵國俘虜而盡力之日外務及大東亞兩省官員暨多數和平搭客，遽爾遭此犧牲，殊堪惋惜，然而美國之暴舉，實使日本國民更加髮指。</p>

<h3 id="c31">今日之朱家角 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 志澄</p>
<p>朱家角本　珠街閣，鄉民咸稱「角里」，離靑浦十二里，位於漕港河畔，幅員不廣，人口三萬八千餘，分佈鄉鎭各地；數十年來，未經兵燹，更以事變後，鄉區受各雜色部隊之騷擾，鄉民不安於店，遂漸向鎭內集中，人口愈見稠密。在上海疏散人口聲中，滬民之來至當地者，不在少數，現將朱家角近况報吿於后：</p>
<p>市街熱鬧</p>
<p>朱家角全鎭，共分三鎭，北鎭，張何鄉，安莊鄉，張丁鄉，薛問鄉’沈巷鄉，　澳鄉是也。情形以三鎭較佳，六鄉次之。鎭內以北大街最爲熱鬧，行人踵接，商業精華集中於此，因爲事變時未受波及，所以繁榮的禁象，據說較事變前尤盛﹔故有「三涇不如一角」之稱。（按：三涇即楓涇，泗巡，朱涇，上述三地因受戰事影響，房屋塌毀，市面淒凉，）只是路面狹隘，而且潮濕多水。</p>
<p>民生一般</p>
<p>朱家角的環境，較靑浦其他各郊區爲佳，元）麥，豆，蔬菜及魚，蝦等。本地向稱「魚蝦之鄉」，然事實上魚蝦價格，並不甚廉，考其原因是：在上海魚蝦上市的時候，所有產物，儘量運滬，俾可獲得高利，當地價格亦隨之步漲，銷路亦復不弱：俟上海落市後，當地各販戶，因鑒於以前之銷路，並不跌價，故始終與上海相似。輸入物資，以來自杭州一帶之竹爲大宗，故鎭內竹製品較多，如扁担，竹槁，淘　，畚箕，掃帶等。燃料以稻草居多，樹柴則巳用爲生產之原動力矣。如電燈廠之發電，（朱家角電力廠，每日供電五小時，自七時至十二時，每度一千五百元，）及工廠之生產與汽車之燃料等。</p>
<p>朱家角所產糧食不多，農民除自吃外，統歸當局收買爲軍需及民需之用。間亦有他地來此收買者，但運輸之安全是一問題，蓋因四郊各種部隊甚多也。</p>
<p>治安經濟</p>
<p>治安方面，有警備隊，保安隊，警察署等維持着，故地方尙稱安謐。本鎭屬靑浦縣第六區，設有區公署，在區長之下，有鎭長三人。民衆方面，更有保甲及自衛團之組織，附於區公署內，設指導員二人，分　上列事務，故竊盜案件絕少。</p>
<p>朱家角是近郊各區之交通中心，因此商業相當發達。記者僅僅一日的勾留，在繁盛區域徘徊了一次，巳經看到了各色的牌號﹔熱鬧的市街上，獨多食品店，百貨店，但看不到一家書店，這也許是合乎當地習尚的緣故。金融方面鎭內並無銀行，却有四家錢莊開着，成爲商業的後台，與各地互通滙兌。</p>

<p>朱家角敎育距標準尙遠，目前鎭內僅有中學一校，公私立小學四校，民敎館一處，共有中小學生一千五百七十餘人，一般程度在水準之下、且失學兒童亦復不少。情形頗爲嚴重，常地不乏殷實紳商，平素願出巨資重修廟宇，而未注意敎育之重要，頗少捐資興學，開啓民智的。</p>
<p>房屋情形</p>
<p>本鎭人口，素稱稠密，此次上海疏散人口後，一般人認此地為安全區域，故人口又見增加；此地空屋向來極少，所以本鎭住戶大受影響，房屋糾紛，層見疊出﹔蓋因目前當地屋屋的租金，普通一間至少食米二升，昂貴者至一斗之巨。於是二房東藉口期滿收回自用，逐出老房客，故區公署常排解房屋糾紛，最近有上海某孤兒院，由區長之設法，已借得某廟宇爲院址。聞區長對公益頗熱心。</p>
<p>水陸交通</p>
<p>自滬至朱家角，可從陸路至靑浦，再從水路至朱家角；或由上海乘內河輪船，直達朱家角。此較以後者爲便利，旅費也較省，僅二千五百元。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Okinawa and Ryukyu: Six Enemy Ships Sunk in Three Days, Kamikaze Air Force Repeatedly Attacks with Fruitful Results <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Nansei Islands Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – From the afternoon of the 29th to the 30th, Japanese Kamikaze special attack and air force units repeatedly attacked enemy ships around Okinawa Island and enemy mobile units in the eastern waters of the Ryukyu Islands. The Japanese units attacking the mobile units in the eastern waters sank two aircraft carriers. On the night of the 29th, the Japanese air force attacking ships around the island sank a destroyer. On the night of the 30th, they destroyed or sank a merchant destroyer in the waters off Naha. Furthermore, Japanese submarine units operating in the southeastern waters of the island day and night discovered an enemy transport fleet and sank two ships of unspecified type.</p>
<p>A Certain Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The decisive battle for the Ryukyu Islands has now entered the stage of destroying enemy air bases. This decisive battle is indeed advantageous to the Japanese side. Since the evening of the 27th, the Japanese side has launched an all-out air offensive, suppressing the enemy air force day and night. Control of the night skies has completely fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. The aircraft used by the Japanese side are elite aircraft, and their tactics employ the so-called "Takeda Shingen strategy" of feigned attacks and real attacks, with a two-pronged approach, exhausting all possible night attacks. All night long, they launched group attacks on enemy runways and guide paths, causing the enemy elite to suffer severe setbacks. At the northern airfield, thirteen hits were made, three on the runway, resulting in two fires and one explosion. At the central airfield, eleven hits were made, resulting in one fire. At Ie Island airfield, their runway was bombed. Other airfields, such as those on Kerama Retto and enemy ships in Kin Bay, were also attacked. Continuing on the 28th, they concentrated artillery fire on the central and northern airfields, launching a fierce attack. First, Lieutenant Ogawa Tsugio and Sergeant Major Nakamori Teruo appeared in the vanguard aircraft, observing eleven columns of flames rising at the northern airfield and five hits at the central airfield, using machine guns to strafe enemy blimp groups, causing fires. Furthermore, on the auspicious day of the Emperor's Birthday, the 29th, led by Captain Eguchi Susumu, they concentrated artillery fire on the northern airfield. Among them, First Class Airman Honda Harukichi launched a single-plane attack on Kerama Retto, firing machine guns on the seaplane base, with bullets raining down in a desolate scene.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Army Ministry Awards Citations to Brave Warriors for Offensive Attacks <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced the following: In the air and ground battles in the Ryukyu area, special attack teams and others have set an example, attacking enemy convoys with a die-hard, sure-kill mentality, and assault units have fiercely attacked enemy artillery positions. To commend their distinguished service, citations were awarded the other day and presented to His Majesty the Emperor. The list is as follows: Special Attack Flying Unit, Second Lieutenant of the Army Sumida Kentaro, Katayama Yoshinori, Kitayama Tadashi, Takashima Chizumi, Army Corporal Hosomoto Akira, Kudenshi Ansho, Bu Saboro, Mine Yasumasa, Special Attack Koyatetsu, Akamino Akihito, Army Corporal Akamine Hitoshi (name unclear), Momose Tsuneo, Irie, Special Attack Flying Unit, Second Lieutenant of the Army Yamano Sei, Kura Yoshio, Banta Koyuki, Army Sergeant Major Takahashi Katsumi, Army Sergeant Obata Masakuni, Ishikawa Hiroshi, and Army Corporal Matsui Daisuke, among others. On April 6th, they attacked an enemy force consisting of twenty landing craft and seventy transport ships landing in the Ryukyu area. Navigating a long distance at sea, they captured enemy battleships in the sea south of Cape Zanpa at dusk that day. Braving fierce anti-aircraft fire, they bravely charged and attacked with their bodies, sinking five transport ships and two ships of unknown type, and also damaging two cruisers, one destroyer, five transport ships, and four ships of unknown type, setting some on fire. Their achievements are remarkable. Also, the Shinsento Body-Slamming Team, consisting of Lieutenant of the Army Nishioka Kenji and forty-seven others, since the enemy invaded, landed on Shinsento Island and used heavy artillery to fire on Okinawa Island. The lieutenants were ordered to disrupt the enemy's actions. On April 8th, they boarded wooden boats and departed from a certain base, breaking through the enemy's cordon and successfully landing on the southeastern part of the island. Afterward, they went straight to the heavy artillery positions. Under the intense fire of enemy heavy artillery, the entire team charged into the enemy's positions and fought bravely. In the midst of this, the leader was first injured, and casualties followed one after another, but they did not give in, continuing to attack, and finally blew up three heavy guns and their ammunition, also killing and wounding many soldiers, rendering the island's heavy artillery group silent for the next two days. Their contribution was great.</p>

<h3 id="e11">The National Sacrifice of Führer Hitler and International Trends <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Oslo Radio broadcast on the night of May 1 that German Führer Hitler had died a national sacrifice that day. This is a shocking news that has astonished the world. Although the war led by German Führer Hitler against Bolshevism and to defend Germany, and the struggle led by the Allies against British and American imperialism, had different goals and targets, they were completely consistent in building an ideal new world order. Therefore, we people of East Asia unanimously express our condolences for the national sacrifice of the German Führer.</p>
<p>However, we must not turn to pessimism or disappointment about the ideal cause because of mourning for the death of Führer Hitler. Throughout his life, he struggled tirelessly to love his country and improve the world. During the First World War, he joined the volunteer army due to his patriotic fervor and fought on the Western Front, being wounded twice. When Germany was unfortunately defeated, his grief was unbearable. At that time, there were external threats of division from imperialists and internal revolutionary riots from communists. At a time when the country was on the brink of ruin, he organized the National Socialist Party in 1919. After many difficulties, he used the party as a foundation, and in 1933, he took charge of state affairs, turning the country from danger to safety, from weak to strong, and finally obtaining the protection of the entire country. Based on the threat posed by British and American imperialism and the Bolshevik Party to Europe and the world, he resolutely wanted to take Germany as the center and launched a grand strategy to build a new world order, which attracted worldwide attention. His political views were not completed, and he died a national sacrifice, but his spirit of loyalty and patriotism will always be recorded in history.</p>
<p>Although the death of the German Führer will have some impact on the overall war situation in Europe, as long as we understand German history and the national character of the Germanic people, we can firmly believe that there will be no surrender by Germany, and there will be no kneeling Germanic people. No matter how difficult the environment may be, Führer Hitler's spirit of regarding death as home will inevitably be emulated by future German leaders and the Germanic people. Now, former Admiral Dönitz has succeeded the German Führer. In his message to the entire nation, he has firmly stated that "the struggle against Bolshevism will continue until the German military and civilians can obtain a status of not being slaves and not being destroyed." This is precisely the manifestation of the German spirit.</p>
<p>From the broadcast of the new German Führer, it is clear that no matter what degree the changes in the war situation may be in the future, the Germans will never surrender to the enemy and will use various effective methods to persist in resisting the enemy. However, from the standpoint of the East Asian countries opposing British and American imperialist aggression, no matter what changes there may be in the war situation in Europe, there can be no influence on the determination of the East Asian nations to seek survival. At the same time, due to the German people's determination not to surrender and the intensification of the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the enemy will not be able to transfer troops from Europe to East Asia. The enemy's original forces in East Asia have suffered serious blows in recent counterattacks. We must strengthen our beliefs, eliminate any pessimistic and wavering emotions, and strive for future victory.</p>

<h3 id="e12">From Shanghai to Beijing <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Qiao</p>
<p>The special express train from Shanghai to Nanjing East departs at 8:30, but the ticket check-in area is already crowded with people at 7:00. On this day, most of the passengers are still single merchants, mostly getting off at Wuxi and Zhenjiang. After arriving in Nanjing, I stayed at the Xiaoyang Inn. The next day, I crossed the river to Pukou, intending to take the Jinpu train to continue north. When I arrived at Pukou Station, I was told that the Huai River Bridge was under repair. After waiting for four days in Nanjing, the north-south passenger trains resumed. The crowding of passengers was no different from the Jinghu Road. The journey was safe and uneventful, with only an air raid alarm encountered in Dezhou, and no traces of aircraft were seen. The entire journey from Pukou to Beiping took a total of forty hours, which, according to the railway staff, was considered very fast.</p>
<p>The long-lost old capital is still bustling and the scenery is the same. In terms of population density, it is even more crowded than before the incident. This is an abnormal phenomenon of wartime, because the interior is unsafe, and many wealthy families have moved to the cities to live. The prices of goods in North China are also the same as in Central China, that is, they are constantly rising periodically. However, the prices of goods in North China have always been lower than in Central China. Since the base is small, although it has risen, it is still lower than in Central China. People who have lived in Beijing for a long time often lament the high prices, but people who come from Shanghai always feel that things are cheap in Beijing. For example, white rice, the quality of Jingxi rice is not much different from the ordinary thin rice in the suburbs of Shanghai. Although Shanghai is close to the rice-producing area, the price of rice is around 100,000. Although there are not many rice fields near Beijing, the price of white rice per stone is only about 56,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. Flour and miscellaneous grains are also lower than in Shanghai. General industrial products, except for cotton cloth, are higher than in Shanghai. Because North China produces cotton and Tianjin has textile factories, the price of cotton cloth is not higher than in Shanghai. Indigo cloth retails for about 140 yuan per foot, or about 840 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. This kind of cotton cloth has more patterns and colors than Shanghai. According to industry insiders, in recent years, prices have risen sharply, people's purchasing power has weakened, and goods are not easy to sell, so cotton mills have had to compete on the variety of patterns and colors. Most of the pedestrians on the streets of Beijing are ragged, fully demonstrating the poverty of the people.</p>
<p>The cheapest thing to live in Beijing is fuel. The allocated price of white coal briquettes is only 1,200 yuan per ton, and tree firewood is only two or three yuan per catty. The next cheapest is food and vegetables. As for foreign goods such as soap, matches, toothpaste, and cosmetics, they are all more expensive than in Shanghai. According to travelers who often travel to and from Nanjing, everything is cheap in Beijing, only gold and rent are expensive. The price of gold rises and falls with the market price in Tianjin, and the market price in Tianjin rises and falls with Shanghai. Because gold is small in volume and easy to smuggle, the difference in gold prices between the two places is very small.</p>
<p>The local bureau here believes that the high price of gold is enough to stimulate prices, so it has cracked down on gold merchants who are privately raising gold prices. Because the crackdown is extremely strict, most merchants dare not openly trade. They either use secret codes or gestures, and no one dares to publicly quote the market price. Recently, I heard that the authorities plan to limit the price of gold in Beijing and Tianjin to a maximum of 70,000 yuan per ounce. Whether it will be effective remains to be seen. Because of the surge in the price of gold, general prices are also affected. Compared with the beginning of March, prices at the end of March were about 10% higher. The price problem in North China cannot be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Japan Continues to Lodge Serious Protest with US Over the Awamaru Incident <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Regarding the sinking of the Japanese ship "Awamaru," which was transporting relief supplies to prisoners and detainees of the United States and its allies, by a US submarine in the Taiwan Strait at midnight on April 1st, the Japanese government immediately requested a reply from the US government through the Swiss government, which shows that the US attitude is obviously insincere. On the 26th, the Japanese government again entrusted the Swiss Legation in Tokyo to lodge the most serious protest with the US government, and declared that it reserved all necessary rights to deal with such perfidious behavior. The protest letter detailed the circumstances of the "Awamaru" incident and concluded that the US's perfidious behavior was "an unprecedented outrage in the history of warfare." This kind of behavior is the US voluntarily abandoning the issue of the treatment of prisoners and detainees under the power of the Japanese Empire. The Japanese Imperial Government will thoroughly investigate the responsibility borne by the US government for this perfidious behavior that violates humanitarianism and the fundamental principles of international law. At the same time, the sinking of the Awamaru caused a tragic loss of more than a thousand peaceful passengers and cargo with the ship. The ship was transporting relief supplies to enemy prisoners, and its passengers included Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Consul Suzuki and Hanami, translator, Yamana Fu, Sugita, Ministry of Greater East Asia Councilor Funakoshi, former Vice Consul, Arai secretary, Iwai, etc. The above-mentioned individuals died at the same time as the Awamaru. Among the remaining passengers were Vice Minister Takeuchi of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, Director Yamada of the Foreign Ministry Investigation Bureau, Director of the Political Affairs Division of the Southern Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, Togo, Secretary Hoshina to the Minister of Greater East Asia, etc. These were all officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Greater East Asia who were doing their best to transport relief supplies and rescue enemy prisoners, as well as many peaceful passengers, who were suddenly sacrificed, which is truly regrettable. However, the US's outrage has made the Japanese people even more furious.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – San Francisco telegram: The issue of inviting Argentina was discussed as scheduled at the plenary session on the afternoon of the 30th.

In the past, the invitation of various countries to participate in the conference was agreed upon by the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, so this principle must not be violated. However, as a result of the vote, with the exception of eleven abstentions, the motion to invite Argentina to participate in the conference was finally passed by a vote of thirty-one to four.</p>

On April 30th, the Führer appointed Dönitz as his successor. The new Head of State will deliver a speech to the German people."</p>
<p>Dönitz Broadcast</p>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Following the announcement of the news of Hitler's death, the new German Head of State, Grand Admiral Dönitz, broadcast to the German people, saying: "My primary task is to save the German people from destruction by the Bolsheviks. To accomplish this great task, we must continue to fight. Führer Hitler died heroically, and the German people mourn him with the deepest sorrow and respect. Hitler had long recognized the terrible danger of Bolshevism, and fought against it at the cost of his life, dedicating himself to Germany. His fight against the Bolshevik flood not only benefited Europe, but also the entire world. The Führer has appointed me as his successor. I have been entrusted with this task in a time of crisis, and I am deeply aware that my duty as leader of the German people is to save them. The British and Americans are hindering our goals, and the German people will resist them. The British and Americans are not fighting for the interests of their own people, but are sacrificing themselves for the expansion of Bolshevism. What the German people have achieved and endured is unprecedented in history. In the face of the great difficulties to come, I will do my best to serve the German people, but I need your help to achieve this goal. Everyone must fulfill their responsibilities. Loyalty to me means maintaining order everywhere, so that we can reduce suffering and avoid collapse. If we do our best, God will bless us."</p>

<p>Oslo, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The new German Head of State, Dönitz, announced his determination to the German army, saying: "Comrades, Führer Hitler has died heroically. He was loyal to his ideal of saving the people of Europe from the poisonous hands of Bolshevism. Hitler did not fear death, and thus achieved his benevolent wish. The greatest hero in German history has left this world. The Führer has appointed me as the leader of the nation and the supreme commander of the German army, to continue the fight against Bolshevism, until the German people can achieve a status of not being slaves and not being destroyed. The war against Britain and America will continue until they cease to hinder the German people's fight against Bolshevism. You have accomplished great historical achievements, and the German people, who long to end the war, are now still required by the circumstances to make unconditional further efforts. I demand that you obey, and only by implementing my orders completely and without reservation can we avoid chaos and destruction. Those who abandon their duties are traitors and will enslave the German people. Your loyalty to the Führer should now continue to me. Soldiers, the lives of the German people are in danger. Please fulfill your responsibilities and do not slack off."</p>

<p>Zurich, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Northern Italian National Liberation Committee, composed of radical elements from the Communist and Socialist parties, opposes Bonomi and continues to carry out intense activities. Relations between the two sides have suddenly turned sour. The leader of the National Liberation Committee, the socialist Bergelini, broadcast on the 28th from Merano, saying: Bonomi supported the Fascist Party in 1921 and is now a monarchist. Therefore, the working class will launch a struggle to overthrow the monarchist Bonomi faction that is even fiercer than the fight against the Fascists. In response, the Bonomi government convened an emergency meeting on the 28th to discuss countermeasures. The British and Americans are also closely monitoring the actions of the Liberation Committee, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Central Reserve Bank Continues to Supply Cash to Banks and Money Shops; Profiteering Through Discounting Should Be Strictly Prohibited <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>There is a shortage of cash in the city, and businesses, banks, and money shops seem to be experiencing difficulties in buying, selling, collecting, and paying. The main reasons are nothing more than three points: cash flowing to other areas, citizens hoarding for emergencies, and unscrupulous merchants taking advantage of the situation for profit. However, according to inquiries from the financial sector: the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank has recently been providing the 60 note-issuing banks of the banking industry and the Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry, and the Joint Reserve Treasury of the money shop industry, with the daily amount of cash that they are allowed to withdraw. Based on the bank's leading position in the banking industry, the amount has been fully prepared daily for withdrawal, without interruption or reduction. Moreover, in response to their necessary requests, the amount has been appropriately increased to meet the needs of the market. It is incomprehensible why there is still a sense of insufficiency. On the contrary, profiteering through discounting is becoming increasingly rampant, and the amount of cash on hand is very large. The source of this cash deserves serious attention. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will take strict measures to prohibit it, in order to stabilize the market and ensure the livelihood of the people.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government, recognizing that although land transportation is still passable, most highways have fallen into disrepair due to years of neglect and are unable to handle vehicular traffic, and that the city is actively dispersing the population, it is imperative to carry out highway construction. Therefore, the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway Engineering Office was established and officially started work the day before yesterday, deciding to first repair the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway. It is now learned that the office believes that the highways connecting Shanghai to various counties are not limited to the Shanghai-Suzhou road, but also the two highways between Songjiang and Shanghai, and Wuxi and Shanghai, need to be repaired. Therefore, it is planned to carry out the work simultaneously. In order to expand the scope of work of the office, it has specially requested the Municipal Government to rename the office as the Shanghai Special Municipality Highway Construction Engineering Office, in order to reflect the actual situation.</p>

<p>The authorities of the City Police Bureau, believing that the recent rumors in Shanghai are mostly spread by illegal speculators in the market, attempting to stimulate market prices, have repeatedly dispatched personnel to investigate and arrest Yang Changgeng (58 years old, from Menghe, Wujin, residing at No. 3 Dunhe Lane, Xiangyang Road) and Huang Chifu (78 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 367 Fuzhou Road) at Fuyuan Securities Firm, Room 553, Huashang Securities Exchange, Jiujiang Road. Yang and Huang usually engage in unauthorized short selling and buying on the market, similar to the nature of outside brokers. It was found that Yang was a clerk in a Nanshi money shop before the Incident. After the Incident, he lost his job and speculated in the municipal government bond market. Later, he stayed in the securities exchange every day, engaging in illegal profiteering. At 3 p.m. on April 16th, Yang was at Fuyuan Securities Firm, talking with Ding Nianming, the manager of the firm, and Chen Xiuji, Huang Chifu, and other speculators similar to Yang, about market changes, and mentioning the Pacific War and the European War, taking the opportunity to maliciously spread rumors, attempting to gain illegal profits. The police bureau secretly controlled the situation and arrested Yang and Huang for strict interrogation. According to their confessions, they spread rumors in the hope of illegally changing market prices. It is heard that the police bureau is currently strictly investigating the source of the rumors and the illegal reasons. According to the police authorities, if similar situations are found again in the future, and those who maliciously spread rumors will be subject to more severe punishments.</p>

<p>The City Police Bureau found that there were no fixed methods for judicial police to seize stolen goods from pawnshops and second-hand stores, and that only the investigating officers issued notes, which were not uniform. In addition, the Crime Prevention Section of the Third Division found that some criminals impersonated judicial police and defrauded property in the name of seizing stolen goods from pawnshops. In order to unify the methods of seizing stolen goods and in response to the request of the Pawnshop Trade Association, the Crime Prevention Section formulated the "Provisional Measures for Judicial Police to Seize Stolen Goods," which was approved by Zhou Zhou, the concurrently serving Director, and has been promulgated and implemented. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>1. When the liaison offices of the Third Division of this Bureau and the Third Section of each branch need to seize stolen goods, they shall follow the provisions of these measures.</p>
<p>2. When seizing stolen goods, the investigating officer must carry a three-part seizure book. The first part shall be filled out and issued to the store from which the stolen goods are seized as a temporary receipt. The second part shall be attached to the file for verification. The third part shall be kept in the section or left in the branch for reference (this three-part book has been printed and distributed to each branch by the Crime Prevention Section).</p>
<p>3. The first part of the three-part seizure book shall be filled out by the investigating officer. The second and third parts must be stamped with the seals of the head of the section or the head and deputy head of the Third Section of the branch and the investigating officer to emphasize responsibility.</p>
<p>4. If the store from which the stolen goods are seized is found not to have intentionally received the stolen goods, it can apply to the section or the Third Section of the branch for the stolen goods to be returned to the victims and receive the price of the stolen goods. The original receipt shall be kept for reference.</p>
<p>5. These measures may be revised at any time if there are any omissions.</p>
<p>6. These measures shall take effect from the date of approval. It is learned that the sections and branches have complied with and implemented these measures. In the future, judicial police seizing stolen goods from pawnshops and second-hand stores must use the three-part book to issue temporary receipts. If there is no such receipt, it can be refused and reported to the relevant branch for investigation.</p>
<p>Police Bureau Reissues Union Member Badges</p>
<p>The badges issued by the City Police Bureau to its employees in the past have been lost due to prolonged use.

<h3 id="e31">Zhujiajiao Today <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Cheng</p>
<p>Zhujiajiao was originally called Zhujie Pavilion. The villagers commonly call it "Jiaoli." It is located twelve li from Qingpu, on the bank of the Caogang River. Its area is not vast, and its population is over 38,000, distributed throughout the towns and villages. For decades, it has not suffered from the ravages of war. Moreover, after the Incident (likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War), the rural areas were harassed by various mixed troops, making the villagers uneasy in their shops, and they gradually concentrated in the town, making the population more dense. Amidst Shanghai's evacuation of its population, no small number of Shanghai residents have come to this area. The current situation of Zhujiajiao is reported below:</p>
<p>Bustling Streets</p>
<p>The entire town of Zhujiajiao is divided into three towns: North Town, Zhanghe Township, Anzhuang Township, Zhangding Township, Xuewen Township, Shenxiang Township, and Yu'ao Township. The situation in the three towns is better, followed by the six townships. Within the towns, North Street is the most lively, with pedestrians constantly passing by. The essence of commerce is concentrated here. Because it was not affected during the Incident, the prosperous scene, it is said, is even more flourishing than before the Incident. Therefore, there is a saying that "Three Jing is not as good as one Jiao." (Note: Three Jing refers to Fengjing, Sixun, and Zhujing. The above three places suffered from the war, houses were destroyed, and the market was desolate.) It's just that the road surface is narrow, and it is also humid and watery.</p>
<p>General Livelihood</p>
<p>The environment of Zhujiajiao is better than other suburbs of Qingpu. The main products are wheat, beans, vegetables, fish, shrimp, etc. This place is traditionally known as the "hometown of fish and shrimp." However, in reality, the price of fish and shrimp is not very cheap. The reason is that when fish and shrimp are on the market in Shanghai, all the produce is transported to Shanghai as much as possible to obtain high profits, and the local price also rises accordingly, and sales are also not weak. After the market in Shanghai closes, the local vendors, in view of the previous sales, do not lower prices, so they remain similar to Shanghai. Imported materials are mainly bamboo from the Hangzhou area, so there are more bamboo products in the town, such as carrying poles, bamboo poles, filtering baskets, dustpans, brooms, etc. Fuel is mostly straw, and tree firewood has already been used as the driving force for production, such as the power generation of the electric light factory (Zhujiajiao Power Plant supplies electricity for five hours a day, from 7:00 to 12:00, at 1,500 yuan per degree), and the production of factories and the fuel for automobiles, etc.</p>
<p>Zhujiajiao does not produce much grain. In addition to the farmers eating it themselves, it is all purchased by the authorities for military and civilian use. Occasionally, there are also those who come here to buy from other places, but the safety of transportation is a problem, because there are many different troops in the four suburbs.</p>
<p>Public Security and Economy</p>
<p>In terms of public security, the garrison, security team, and police station maintain order, so the area is still considered peaceful. This town belongs to the sixth district of Qingpu County, and there is a district office. Under the district chief, there are three town chiefs. On the public's side, there are even Baojia (household registration system) and self-defense groups, attached to the district office, with two instructors in charge of the above-mentioned affairs, so cases of theft are very rare.</p>
<p>Zhujiajiao is the transportation center of the nearby suburban areas, so commerce is quite developed. The reporter only stayed for one day, and after wandering around the prosperous area once, had already seen various brands. On the lively streets, there are many food stores and department stores, but no bookstores, which may be in line with local customs. In terms of finance, there are no banks in the town, but there are four money shops open, becoming the backbone of commerce, and exchanging remittances with various places.</p>
<p>Educational Undertakings</p>
<p>Zhujiajiao's education is far from the standard. At present, there is only one middle school, four public and private primary schools, and one people's education center in the town. There are more than 1,570 primary and middle school students in total. The general level is below standard, and there are also many children out of school. The situation is quite serious. There is no shortage of wealthy gentry and merchants in Changdi (the location). They are usually willing to spend huge sums of money to rebuild temples, but do not pay attention to the importance of education, and rarely donate money to support schools and enlighten the people.</p>
<p>Housing Situation</p>
<p>The town's population has always been dense. After Shanghai's evacuation of its population this time, people generally consider this place to be a safe area, so the population has increased again. There are very few empty houses here, so the residents of this town have been greatly affected, and housing disputes have emerged one after another. The reason is that the current rent of houses in the local area is at least two sheng of rice per room, and as high as one dou. Therefore, second landlords take the opportunity to reclaim their property for their own use after the lease expires, evicting old tenants, so the district office often mediates housing disputes. Recently, a certain orphanage in Shanghai, through the efforts of the district chief, has borrowed a temple site as the site of the orphanage. It is said that the district chief is very enthusiastic about public welfare.</p>
<p>Water and Land Transportation</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Zhujiajiao, you can go by land to Qingpu, and then by water to Zhujiajiao; or take an inland river steamer from Shanghai directly to Zhujiajiao. The latter is more convenient, and the travel cost is also cheaper, only 2,500 yuan.</p>
