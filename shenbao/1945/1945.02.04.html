<h3>呂宋島戰況激烈　日精稅奮勇邀擊　確守正面陣綫阻止敵前進</h3>
<p>呂宋島前綫三日中央社電日軍業以突擊戰法，衝入美軍仁牙因灣橋頭堡之側面，二十八·九兩日，曾殺傷敵兵七十二名，鹵獲戰車一輛，機檢十支，較重機檢一挺，彈藥千六百發，三十一日復於羅沙留及其東方巴岐俄登山口之康普方面，展開拉鋸戰。而中部呂宋平原之日軍，亦與此相呼應，至夕刻曾將企岡進攻馬尼刺之美軍擊退至加爾明方面。同時，日軍五百名挺身突擊隊，亦曾奇襲莫尼約斯西南方六公里之美軍迫擊砲陣地，破壞其迫擊砲數門，日軍精銳復曾進攻克拉克飛行楊羣五周邊地區，攪亂向聖佛南多攻擎之美軍側背，並與其後方之敵軍激鬥中。美軍自利用雷伊泰，明多羅烏，刻更於仁牙因，　法昂等地急於建設飛行場，而欲依此等基地之航空勢力及海上機動隊之艦載機，實施掩護作戰，并以戰車爲先鋒之陸上部隊南下。二十九日夕刻，敵曾以戰車二輛，派兵二百名來攻聖佛南多，卒被日軍擊退。至三十一日，美軍戰艦五艘，驅遂艦三十五艘，運輸船二十五艘，曾接近巴坦加斯西方海面，是日晨敵又於巴利安半島北部蘇比格灣方面，亦曾以相當數目之兵力登陸，如斯呂宋戰局愈爲緊迫矣。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫三日中央社電　蘇比格灣附近及巴坦加斯西岸新登陸之敵軍，繼續猛攻，企圖自西北方侵入馬尼刺，前由南聖佛南多南下之敵機甲部隊，經越卡羅比特進出於布拉坎州挻進，距馬尼刺四十公里以內之地，巴坦加斯西岸一帶日軍，於敵登陸點那斯布克東方十公里之阿卡附近，邀擊敵軍，現在激戰中。克拉克菲爾德地區，日軍精銳對一師之敵機甲部隊，自二十五日以來，作壯烈之攻擊，迄三十日止，敵之損失，計敵棄屍二九三具，戰車擱淺起火十四輛，鹵獲汽車五輛及其他火砲，重火器等多數，日軍士氣愈益旺盛，現正奮戰中。卡巴那辰方面，日軍已阻止圖由馬尼刺公路前進之敵軍，確守卡巴那辰芷面陣綫。至於羅沙留阿嘎特地區日軍，依然肉搏奮戰中，使敵爲之摺伏，敵之行動，極不活躍，其前進已被阻，敵軍爲打開此方難關，籍空軍之援助，攻擊趨於積極，利用仁牙因，聖法比安，達古旁，馬納奥四處機塲，集結B25型及其他各型機約三百架，欲圖活動。</p>
<p>呂宋前綫基地三日中央社電　美軍於呂宋島之戰鬥，槪無目標，不分都市森林，盡盲炸之能事，並藉戰車之掩護，胡亂衝擊，美軍爲達到此目的，不僅使用此不顧人道之手段，並轟炸醫院學校敎堂。一月三十日，敵B29型機六架，對巴岐東方六十公里之巴本地方之敎皇及醫院投彈盲炸，除尼僧五名被傷外，住院病人多數亦被炸傷，敵機更大膽作低空之飛行，對明顯塗有紅十字標識之醫院，亦不惜反覆投彈。按是日天氣晴朗，雖於極高之天空，對地上顯明少標識，決能明白看出，敵美乃施以此種暴行，益使當地人民無不憤激。</p>
<h3>泰首相召集政軍會議</h3>
<p>盤谷二日中央社電　泰國首相阿巴溫氏，一日十時召集政府高級官吏及高級軍人等百八十名，舉行會議，席問首相闡明泰國對內對外政策之根本方針，要旨如次：泰國對外國履行義務，遵守恊定，決以誠意澈底爲方針，即以公的爲公的，對內施策，於戰時下當局應分担政治之責任，本人深望諸君於自覺下，盡職努力，以圖國家及國民之利益，且現在政府決基於憲法，於民主主義原則之下，推行政治，故官吏及軍人諸活動，自當坦白披瀝見解，本人亦當十分尊重諸君之意見，本人自身爲泰國及泰國國民，決不惜任何犧牲，切望諸君亦捨去個人立塲，完成偉大事業。</p>

<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>日文「重慶政權之分析」序</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>有人對我說：「俗云事無千日功，那末你在上海苦心研究中國政治動向，巳有十年之久，自然該有多少獨具隻眼的心得，無妨發表一二，以供關心時事者參考呢？」還有人往往說；在中國愈住得久，而愈不懂得中國。初次來中國的人，在兩三年內就鎔成了一種關於中國的一般觀念。以後便無論碰到什麼中國問題，總想以這個觀念來解釋，即想以不變的成見來適應萬變的現象。在他本人的頭腦中這樣想，固然可以，甚至有時候籍以對於新近來華的人大吹一頓法螺，自詡中國問題專家，固然也無不可，但在中國人間實事求是時，就突然一竅不通，到處碰壁了。於是就感覺到前此的中國理解，根本推翻，無法應付，自己對於此等不瞭解的事象，便託辭爲絕對「不可知」的事象，而不了了之。僑居中國而有這樣經騐的，一定大不乏人。我認爲其理由如下：</p>
<p>中國大部份的民衆是農民，他們的生活始終無大變化。只看到這一面，而就說「中國是現在的中世紀歐洲」，或說「中國人是在二十世紀過十七世紀生活的民族」，這是對的。於是便匆忙地作一武斷的結論。認爲中國人在經濟上旣是落後兩三世紀的民族，那末在政治上也按這個「高見」來應付，就不會出錯。根據這種見解，而就對中國人下種種「工夫」。然而結果，不啻「隔靴搔癢」，徒勞無功。中國只是像羊一樣的溫柔，像牛一樣的沉默，聽着日本人滔滔懸河的講解，但始終並不表示日本人所期望的那種精神反應。於是日本人就應富再作一次自我檢討。中國人究竟爲什麼沒有精神反就？這不是我們的「工夫」以沉黑來表示反對麼？假定不幸而言中，那末這個中國人的辨別能力，究竟怎樣取得的？根據這個疑問向前研究，方會在中國問題上達到三昧境。總而言之，中國百分之九十的人口，是連自己姓名都不能寫的文盲。但在政治上指導他們的，卻是具有三十年民族革命經騐及遠大政治眼光的知識階級。他們並不像日本人那樣過着安定的政治生活，而且是在日本人從未體騐過的許多異旅之壓迫和欺騙下成長起來的。所以他們有日本人想像不到的政治程度。他們曾經體騐過民主主義的革命，甚至也曾體騐過無產階級的革命。就是這樣前進的知識階級，在指導着落後的民衆，而形成今日的「中華民族」。聯想到此，方感覺出來中間問題的複雜性。然而這種複雜性，如再加以思索，就會知道中國問題的複雜，決不是單純由國內本身所構成，而是反映着世界各國的鬥爭與妥協，而在不斷變化着。唯其如此，中國問題如不以不斷努力來研究，是無法瞭解的。尤其最近的中國問題，由於世界各國的利害關係，像一個亂結一樣交纏着，所以愈加難以揣摸了。縱令極其勾心鬥角和複雜錯綜，然而開解東亞的「亂結」者岀非日本莫屬。暫且說一句別人所認爲的外行話，目前日本主要的大敵由東方殺向前來，而日本主要的刀鋒却刺向西方，這眞令人百思莫解。正如亞力山大，快刀斬亂麻般地解開「亂結」後，才進行東征一樣，日本如大刀關斧地解開東亞的「亂結」後，移師東指，如是大東亞戰爭的勝利，方可操左劵。</p>
<p>我根據這一見解，曾在近半年來埋頭鑽砥中國問題，特別是重慶政權問題。研究結果，便一一發表於申報上。然而卻得到了意外的反響，不僅申報刊載，甚至新中國報，大陸新報，北平的新民報，漢口的大楚報，金華的浙贛日報等，都爭先恐後地接連不斷刋載。這或許是近十年來日本人所發表的言論中，最引起中國人反響的一種著作吧！然而此等論文，我自已比任何人都知道，決非出人頭地的卓絕著作。唯一可取之處，就是我以客觀態度來觀察中日關係，想和中國人一同認眞地發現大東亞戰爭的解決方法。在另一意義上，這也可以說是日本人對於中日事變所作的自我批判。所謂戰爭的最後勝利，老實說，是戰爭指導理論的勝利。孟子曾說過：「征之爲言正也，各欲正已也，焉用戰」，所以我認爲當前文化人的最大任務，就是對於現在我們戰爭的本質，要不斷進行向我批判，要逐漸提高我們的戰爭指導理論。（靖譯）</p>

<p>大陸基地三日中央社電　此次於日軍部隊猛烈進擊之結果，爲渝美空軍前進基地中樞之遂川已終於陷落，至此所謂遂贛地區之機塲羣，終於日軍重壓之下，漸吿崩潰，大陸沿岸之敵陣勢，亦隨之失勢。按該邃贛地區之美空軍基地，係以衡陽東南的二百公里之遂川爲中心，以共東南七十公里之贛州，及該地南方百公里之新城，北方百公里之吉安，芷江等各重要地區形成，外加福建省之建甌，廣東省之南雄等各機動墓地構成此一連陣勢，企圖轟炸華南沿岸及台灣方面，並擾亂海上之交通路等，但由於前者日軍之廣西作戰，敵恐被切斷後方之補給路綫，曾一時後退，而將新城建甌兩機塲施工將半之擴張工事，加以破壞，其後幾不再使用，對遂川贛州機場仍賴空中補給，且活動亦益形激化，尤其當此次敵侵攻菲島時，該地曾以大型機積極從事燃料及彈藥之補給，同時該地敵機對該地區亦常以百架左右之戰鬥轟炸機從事活躍。又前一月中間敵機動部隊出現於南中國海之際，而對此作策應出擎，實施牽動作戰，原來該地在留之敵戰鬥機隊，乃美空軍於大陸上之相當擾秀份子，於前次牽制作戰中，已發揮其最後之效能，其於作戰上之重要性，正不可漠視，故該次遂川前進基地之失陷，予敵之打擊實相當深刻。</p>

<h3>市府發行臨時救濟庫券　充調整配米價格及慈善基金</h3>
<p>上海特別市政府發行臨時救濟庫券條例草案及還本付息表，業經中央政治委員會第一四四次會議通過追認，中央社記者爲明暸該庫劵條例內容及還本付息辦法起見，特走訪市府當局，探誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>發行額與用途</p>
<p>上海特別市政府於上年十二月間，據市政諮詢委員曾建議發行臨時救濟庫券，其目的爲期調整全市配給米價格及補助全市慈善救濟基金之用，定名爲上海特別市民國三十四年臨時救濟庫券，總額爲國幣十五萬萬元，一次决發行，以三分之二爲調整配給米價格之用，三分之一爲全市各種慈善救濟基金之用，該庫券定於本年元旦發行，其票面分爲一百萬元，五十萬元，二十萬元，十萬元，五萬元，一萬元，五千元，一千元八種，概不記名。</p>
<p>付息還本辦法</p>
<p>該庫券年息定爲一分二厘，每年付息二次，以五月卅一日及十一月卅日爲付息之期，該庫券用抽籖法分五年償還，第一年祗付利息，第二年（即民國三十五年）起每年分兩期抽籤還本，每期攤還一萬五千萬元，五年全數償淸，前項還本於每年五月十日及十一月十日在市政府舉行抽籤，由財政部審計部派員監視，即於各該月月底開始付款，抽籤時持票人及市民均得自由參觀，該庫券指定以全市消費特稅收入爲還本付息基金。由市財政局依照憑本付息表所載每期應付本息數目，按月平均提撥交由中央儲備銀行及上海特別市復興銀行，列收該庫券基金保管委員會戶帳，以備撥付，萬一某月份所收有不敷時，應另由市政府在其他地方收入項下，立即撥補足額，不得拖欠。</p>

<p>該庫券基金保管委員會，由財政部，審計部，市政府，市財政局，市商會，銀行公會，錢業公會，中央儲備銀行各派代表一人，諮詢委員會二人共同組織之，該庫券得自由買賣抵押，並得充保證金公積余及市面流通交易，其到期本息票，並得用以完納本市租稅。</p>
<h3>中華公司客輪遭美機濫炸</h3>
<p>美機屢次濫施轟炸非武裝船舶及紅十字船，已引起世界人士之公憤，但美機此種非人道行爲，最近更層出不窮，據悉本市中華輪船公司之××號輪船，於白畫遭美機轟炸，乘客死傷七十餘人。該船於一月十六日下午搭載乘客二百二十餘名，航行於揚子江某地上游，詎知駛至××附近時，突有敵機四架，自北方來襲，低穸用機槍掃射後，即向西方飛遁，調查結果，該船乘客三十一名船員三人死亡，復有乘客四十三名船員二名重傷，船長朱某，倖免於難，據朱船長云：該船船射彈痕有數百發之多，舵室客室及蒸汽管等，稍受損傷，當時因船上毫無武器，惟有束手待斃，此種美機慘無人道之作爲，吾人將一世不忘，必予報復而後甘心。</p>
<h3>宣傳處記者例會　提出敎育問題　戴敎局長出席解答</h3>
<p>市宣傳處昨（三）日下午二時，召集本市各報社記者舉行第二次記者例會，市敎育局載局長英夫，偕戴王任秘書，潘主任督學，准時到會，宣傳處劉處長德煊親臨主持，由戴氏就學費，敎職員待遇，民衆敎育等各項問題，分別加以答覆，歷二時餘，始吿散會。茲擷其問答內容於後：</p>
<p>民眾農校敎師問題</p>
<p>（問）全市各民衆晨校能否令市立師範學生擔任義務敎師酌予車費，則不但敎師問題得以解决，即師範學生，亦有實習機會？</p>
<p>（答）本市民衆晨校和夜校之設立，其制度之活用，以便一般民衆能有受敎育之機會，由各該附設晨校之學校敎員檐任，旨在節省經費，至於由師範學生擔任義校敎員，時間車費均不經濟，師範學生照例更有試敎，若令其擔任民敎工作，或許下易進行。</p>
<p>棉布配給已呈政院</p>
<p>（問）敎員擬爲敎職員辦理棉布配給一節，聞之莫不雀躍，未悉進行概况如何？</p>
<p>（答）敎職員米糧重點配給已有結果，敎職員需布極殷，爰呈請市府特別配給一次，現已　市府轉呈行政院，當能令商統會辦理，至於將來配給辦法，當請有關各機關共同處理，以杜流弊。</p>
<p>（問）敎師配給米每月本配給兩次，共計三斗，歷來從未脫期，但一月份祗配過一次，第二次迄未配給，未知係何原因，短期內是否再行補配？</p>
<p>（答）昨經詢問物配處劉處長，據稱：「該項配給米，尙未領到，一俟到齊，即行發配。」</p>
<p>（問）下學期開學在即，聞國定敎科書學生購置不易，祗得求諸黑市，無形增高家長之負擔，未知貴局有所聞吾，及對此種黑市，如何加以消減？</p>
<p>（答）敎部當局爲節省物力起見，曾令敎局草擬敎科書保管辦法，曾呈經市府備查在案，關於敎科書之發行，敎部委託中國聯合出版公司承辦，與本局無關，其定價亦由部規定，現在發生黑市情形，本人曾加以調查，而書店方面加以否認，或係批發商從中非法牟利，現正設法消滅此項現象。</p>
<p>不遵規定收費處理</p>
<p>（問）目下私校徵收報名費，不遵敎局規定者甚多，未識當局有何嚴格執行辦法？局方公佈私校學費，分二期繳付，查有若干學校，不遵敎局規定，未知常局有何處置辦法？</p>
<p>（答）關於學費問題，局方曾發覺有許多學校不遵規定，當經召集各該校負責人談話，令其退費，但仍有一部份學校如此，自將親自勸諭各校負責人遵守市府功令，同時準備以二千萬充作私校輔助費，此項槪算雖未通過，但正準備辦理，若再有各校不遵市府功令，徵收學費，經調查屬實，當呈請市長查辦。如有下得不增收學費之理由，只要由局方派員調查實在，未始不可，但上海的風氣太壞，往往相率傚尤，其他本市私立大學收費很高，教局無法管理，（由部管理）但簡接影響中小學費之徵收數額，現正設法辦理中</p>
<p>（問）爲適應鄉區需要，各校微收學米，是否認爲係變通辦法，敎職員薪給，是否仍以米價爲標準，或採米薪各半制？</p>
<p>（答）敎育部並未許可。</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>本報收集一元券　交通要點　分區收集　化零爲整　移充助學</h3>
<p>本報曾於一月十九日發表陳紹嬀先生的倡議，「集一元券助學」，原函云：「近來物價高漲，一元票及角分票，幾爲無用之物；用之亦無人樂意收受，隨便棄置，未免可惜！何如於貴館門口或墻邊置一小箱，任人將小票放入，俟累積成數，充作助金，或且爲數亦可不少。……」陳先生是經濟學家，他的倡議，非常恰當，但看以上寥寥數語，覺得很可取法。本報助學同人經愼重考慮之下，决定採取他珍貴的倡議，辦法是（一）擇定全市交通中心要點，設置「收集一元券銀箱」若干，（地點再行公佈）以便市民隨時放入。（二）凡一元以下的角票，分票，爲市民所認爲無用者，一律歡迎。（三）如有熱心仕女，收集小票值百元以上而希望登報留名者，可將集成之百元，用紙包紮，標明姓名及券數，本報當於檢點後照登，其餘零數，則綜合發表。（四）本報於每晚六時前派員至各處收取小票，檢點淸楚，次日公開發表，以資徵信。我們對於此舉的主要作川，除收集小票，積少成多，化零爲整，以充實助學基金外，是藉此造成普遍性的助學風氣，推而廣之，使全上海市民大家有「愛惜物力」及「藥善好施」的心理。向來捐助學金的人，限於極少數的中產階級，富有的人不背捐錢，貧苦的人無力捐錢；惟有此舉，不論貧富，都是捐款助善的力量的一元以下的小票，無論那一人，那一家，可說隨處都有，倘使全上海每人捐一元，那末四百萬元的總數，很可能成爲事實的。</p>

<p>各校分設免費學額</p>

<h3>記江寒汀畫家</h3>
<p>— 黃玄翁</p>

<h3>鹽田大尉談　立體式海戰　日海軍面目煥然一新　在菲律賓獲重大戰果</h3>
<p>最近日本海軍極有力之空軍精銳部隊，迭在菲律賓呂宋鳥發揮莫大之威力，予敵軍以重創。敵方艦船損失數目，與日俱增，實開海上戰爭之新面目。記者昨特往訪中國方面艦隊報道部鹽田大尉，叩詢日海軍增强組織擴大威力之經過，承逐項解答如次：</p>
<p>菲島近況</p>
<p>（問）菲鳥戰局之演進，其最近情况如何？</p>
<p>（答）太平洋戰局日形激烈，作戰中心在於菲律賓。最近日海陸軍對敵奮戰，收獲重大戰果，其戰况已如報載，不贅。惟最近之戰鬥，與從前略有不同，日海軍近以精銳空軍爲主，對敵奮擊，故目前作戰，實以空軍爲第一主義之戰鬥是也。</p>
<p>（問）菲律賓方面日海軍雖收獲重大戰果，但尙未能將敵方艦船予以全部殲減，一般人頗有以爲日海軍未能十分活躍爲憾，莫故安在？</p>
<p>（答）菲律賓方面日海軍尙未獲得非常戰果，此係時間問題，若謂未能十分活躍，此種言法，殊不盡然。須知日海軍除艦船以外，尙有最有力之航空部隊，畫夜不停，向敵突擊。本年歲首小磯首相曾稱：現在之日本海軍並非從前之海軍，乃係海空聯合組成之有力部隊云云。根據此點，當知日海軍之威力，更非昔比矣。</p>
<p>新式海軍</p>
<p>（問）現代海軍之組成，其槪要可得聞歟？</p>
<p>（答）現代日海軍之威力，乃在能發揮其最大之航空部隊力量。昔日日俄之戰以及第一次歐洲德英在巨德蘭之役，海上作戰唯主力戰艦及巡洋艦等是持，故雙方作戰之武器，亦惟限於種種不同之艦船而止，勝負之分，一以艦隊耗損之程度而定。即以近年而論，華盛頓會議席上關於海軍問題，亦惟以各國艦船之力量作爲討論之中心。至於近代海戰，已漸化爲立體式的，舊式海軍之組織，實已無所施其技，所謂新的海軍，必須擁有强大之空軍，始能於勝利方面得操左券也。</p>
<p>（問）日本海軍之新面目如何？</p>
<p>（答）日本海軍爲適應近代海上作戰起見，其目面已煥然一新。除擁有巨艦巨砲之强大力量外，又參加有超越力之空軍，其組織實已完備之至。最近在作戰上，以艦船在海上保護交通路綫，另一方面則以空軍爲主體，向敵突擊發揮鉅大威力。</p>
<p>今後展望</p>
<p>（問）對於日海軍之展望，其詊可得聞歟？</p>
<p>（答）新海軍之建設，以空軍力量爲首要，已路如上述。至若航空母艦之建造，雖亦需要，但將來於事實方面，尙須加以限制。美國海軍原以巨艦巨砲爲主，茲亦在加强空軍力量，惟其所抱之觀念，則仍不變，以爲自已擁有巨大海軍而可將日本擯諸世界之外；此種妄自尊大，不值一笑。須知日本海軍力量與常鞏固，美雖以全力造艦向日進攻，日海軍必與之周旋，無用其恐懼。最近太平洋上各處日海軍一再發揮威力，將敵方艦船逐漸擊破，可爲明證。日海軍今擁有强大之艦船及空軍力量，將來擊減敵人，自可易如破竹耳。（恩）</p>
<h3>川島遊擊隊的光榮戰績</h3>
<p>以高砂族爲主力而編成的遊擊隊，在川島威伸少佐的指揮下，於摩羅泰鳥上等候美軍來襲。這支遊擊隊活用瓜達加納爾，阿茲，塞班的戰訓，速日猛烈訓練，抱着即使全體陣亡也要使敵軍流最大量血的決心，冒着敵機的轟炸，起卸彈藥食糧，搬人密林中，着着完成游擊勢態，在該島白畫猶黑暗如夜的密林地帶中苦鬥，其辛動忠勇，不言可喻。</p>
<p>九月十五日拂曉，由航空母艦護衛的美軍運輸船團突然出現於齊拉角東西兩岸附近，旋即開始瘋在的艦砲射擊，然後約有一師的敵兵猛然登陸，立即着手建設達爾哈飛行塲</p>
<p>發揮衛鋒攻擊戰眞諦的時期終於到來，川島遊擊隊的一部當即猛攻敵美的飛行塲建設隊，到二十日爲止的五天內，敵軍遺屍二百，負傷二百以上，終將敵兵驅出達爾哈飛行塲。</p>
<p>一方面，哈爾馬赫拉島的該方面日軍本部爲援助川鳥遊擊隊起見，先後派遣中島中尉指揮的第一衝鋒歐及岩崎中尉統帶的第二衝鋒隊，以及九市中尉指揮的第三衝鋒隊在摩羅泰上陸。</p>
<p>得到增援部隊以後的川鳥遊擊隊，一八十月，先則炸毀洛泰拉拉莫機塲附近的敵軍陣地設施，繼復衝入敵軍營幕，粉碎其企圖，其後本部又派遣第一次增援部隊，與川鳥遊擊隊的主力一同開始攻擊，連日連夜予以莫大的威脅，特別在十月二十日夜急襲華夏勃拉南方十公里的皮洛部落附近之敵軍宿營地成功以後，敵機塲的使用愈加受到拘束。</p>
<p>這樣，自十月二十日到二十五日，敵軍所受的損害爲：人員傷亡至少六百名，營舍炸毁十七間，掩護陣地破壞二處以上。</p>
<p>這時，日軍新說的守田部隊却於基地待機進援摩羅泰島，終於十一月十六日利用黑夜登陸，結果不折一兵一卒，與以寡敵衆的川鳥遊擊隊會合，繼續作戰。（譯自十二月二十六日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>菲島日陸軍航空隊之歌</h3>
<p>「君是御空特攻隊」</p>
<p>（一）櫻花比男兒</p>
<p>蝴蝶是賢妻</p>
<p>絢爛兮櫻花</p>
<p>八纮一宇誇名花</p>
<p>（二）明日打頭陣</p>
<p>軍刀映月光</p>
<p>絢爛兮櫻花</p>
<p>俺也慷慨如落華</p>
<p>（三）日櫻發枝頭</p>
<p>怒放亞細亞</p>
<p>絢爛兮櫻花</p>
<p>高奏凱歌迎晨光</p>
<p>（四）無敵號荒鷲</p>
<p>冷然御長風</p>
<p>絢爛兮櫻花</p>
<p>君是御空特攻隊</p>
<p>這首歌詞的作者是雒？不知道。但唱時十分動聽。在決戰的菲律賓方面，日本航空特攻隊的年輕勇士，每次出發時，自部隊長以下，一齊慷慨高歌，唱着上面的歌詞，含笑跨上座機，飛離基地。</p>
<p>「君是御空特攻隊」，唱着自製壯歌而出征的勇士，他們的心情是何等偉大呀！此歌听譜的曲，是「露營之歌」的前奏曲。但第四節的最後，調子不向上而向下。（譯自一日十四日朝日新聞）</p>
<p>華南戰區形勢圖</p>
<p>華南日軍於上月中旬以突擊姿態，開始對粤漢鐵路南部猛烈進攻，於二十四日佔領詔關。同時另一部日軍又佔領遂川機塲及郴縣樂昌等要地，至此粤漢鐵路完全入日軍掌握。此次日軍打通粤漢綫不僅對大陸一貫戰棧益收輔蠶之效，且直接對華南沿海海岸綫之防禦運輸力，增强活躍，對敵美登陸企圖，日軍當更能應付裕如。</p>

<h3>肉</h3>
<p>— 侯千里</p>
<p>阿保提着菜籃，跟媽媽從小菜塲回來，才走進門，就囔着：</p>
<p>「你們來看啊，媽今天買了肉！」</p>
<p>於是孩子一窠風地全擠到廚房裏去了，四個孩子圍着檯子，睜大了眼，盯住那隻籃子望。嘴裏還吱吱喳喳地。</p>
<p>「今天吃肉了！」</p>
<p>「媽，怎麼吃法？弄紅燒好不好？」</p>
<p>做母親的人光起火來</p>
<p>「你們前世沒吃過肉？喏，去曾！難道肉也沒有言過？這樣大驚小怪地。」</p>
<p>於是從菜籃裏拖出一細條肉，使勁地向檯子上一丟，「登！」</p>
<p>孩子們不敢作聲了，還是不轉睛地望住那條肉。</p>
<p>「全給我滾！再站在這兒等會一塊也沒有得吃！」</p>
<p>可是孩子們仍然不動，似乎已經知道這只是恐嚇。</p>
<p>「聽見沒有？—喂！炳炎，你來唁唁這些像虫！」</p>
<p>董炳炎先生正躺在床上唁報，於是站起身來。</p>
<p>孩子們一聽見爹爹的脚步聲，一溜烟地全跑進去了。</p>
<p>爹爹却跑到廚房裏。</p>
<p>「這兒多少？」他指着檯子的一條肉。</p>
<p>「半斤。三百塊！眞是，有什麼吃頭？」太太正在拿肉切成槐子。</p>
<p>要不是爲了今天是星期日，又是董先生的生日，她可眞不會化上三百塊錢去買半斤肉。就是這回，也是董先生先提議的。</p>
<p>「喏，這兒五百塊錢。」昨天晚上臨睡時候。董先生突然掏出幾張票子，「明天買點肉大家吃了吧。孩子們好久沒吃着葷菜了。」</p>
<p>「不要吃了。」太太並不同意：「你上决不是說要買一雙襪子的麼？」</p>
<p>可是董先生也要爲了是自已底生日，興緻特別好。</p>
<p>「襪子慢慢再說吧，而且這是另外一筆外快，辦決算，遲回來，行裏每人都發的。買點肉，再弄點什麼，紅燒燒，正好。」</p>
<p>就這麼着，太太今天買菜的時候，難得地又去切了半斤肉。</p>
<p>孩子們可大大地興奮着，雖是不許到廚房襄去，他們仍然抱着絕大的熟心，站在門口偷偷地看媽媽怎麼弄，嘴裏還是喳喳吱吱地：</p>
<p>「啊呀！巳經十一點半鐘了！」</p>
<p>「媽，幾點鐘吃中飯？」毛頭問。</p>
<p>「肉來不及燒了！」</p>
<p>「呸！來得及的。遲吃就遲點吃好了，有什麼關係。」小妹像大人一樣</p>
<p>「唁明明急死了。」阿保說。</p>
<p>「我才不急呢，」明明表示與世無爭：「吃問有啥道理。」</p>
<p>可是過了一會，他又忍不住問：</p>
<p>「小妹，你猜今天肉有多少？」</p>
<p>「三斤！」小妹猜。</p>
<p>「半斤！」阿保叫起來：「三斤，唁你想？」</p>
<p>「阿保，你喜歡吃什麼？」做哥哥的明明問：「我喜歡吃肉皮！</p>
<p>「肉皮。」阿保表示不同意：「難吃死了！我要吃肥的！」</p>
<p>「我要吃凈的。」小妹說：「凈的比肥的好吃。肥的全是油，有什麼吃頭！」</p>
<p>「我要吃大塊的。」毛頭也參加了意見。</p>
<p>「唉，還沒有好！」明明急起來：「已經十二點鐘了。」</p>
<p>等呀等的，好容易挨到吃中飯。孩子們又忙起來了，他們忙着擺筷子，盛飯，又忙着前前後後地跑。讓大人們知道他也在爲吃飯忙着。</p>
<p>媽媽把肉端來了，毛頭和小妹跟在後面，像報信似地叫着：</p>
<p>「嘔！肉來了，肉來了！」</p>
<p>一家人圍着檯子坐下來了。檯子上，放在爹爹面前的，是一碗紅燒肉。</p>
<p>「媽，今天一個人幾塊？」阿保滿懷希望地問</p>
<p>「吃，吃，吃！」媽媽駡起來：「儘吃好了！別犯窮相。……寗生窮命，不生窮相！我就討厭這種樣子，好像一生一世沒吃過肉！」</p>
<p>孩子們望着爹爹和媽媽，只顧一口一口地吃飯，不敢伸筷子。</p>
<p>董炳炎先生看了，可眞有點不大好過。東西貴，把孩子弄成這種可憐巴巴的樣子，連菜也不敢吃了。</p>
<p>他給孩子們每人夾了一塊，放在飯上。</p>
<p>董先生突然想起百己小的時候，該多幸福。每天都是吃着葷菜，還是母親爲他特別做的那時候，他記得，他也不像現在這些孩子的樣子。</p>
<p>「現在肉這麼希奇。」他向太太和孩子們說：「我們那時候，肉吃也不要吃呢，我常說：「媽，我們換些別的東西吃吧，不要儘吃肉。」第二天家裏就殺雞子。肉，眞是沒人要吃。給下人們吃的。」</p>
<p>孩子們羨慕地聽着父親的幸運，想想要是那時候我也生下來就好了。</p>
<p>突然——</p>
<p>「啊唷哇！」阿保叫起來。</p>
<p>「做什麼？」父親向他看看。</p>
<p>「明明打我！」阿保望着那個比他只大一歲的哥哥。</p>
<p>「他已經吃了一塊肉。」明明叙述阿保的罪狀：「要去夾了。」</p>
<p>「我沒有夾肉。」啊保替自已辯護：「我去夾　　。」</p>
<p>「你還要賴，我親眼看見的。」明明還括了一下臉，「臉皮也不要。」</p>
<p>「什麼不要臉皮？你自己！」</p>
<p>「再吵！」媽媽把碗向檯子一丟，沉下臉：「你們自己聽聽，像什麼東西？」</p>
<p>孩子們又不嚮</p>
<p>董先生突然感到一陣難過。</p>
<p>他覺得，都是他做父親的不好，叫孩子們饞到這副樣子。可是，他又能向誰去訴苦呢？幾年以前，他的薪水雖然沒這麼許多，可是每逢星期日，却也還買點葷菜。過年過節，也都讓孩子們吃一個飽。也從沒有吃回肉也這麼大驚小怪的，像吃個什麼山珍海味。</p>
<p>「眞是的。」他想：「吃這麼一點肉也算得什麼？又不是吃什麼好東西。」</p>
<p>太太正在翻動着那碗菜，把幾片肉從碗底揀出來，堆在他面前，並且又向孩子們看了一限。</p>
<p>幾個孩子立刻低下頭，大口地吃着飯。</p>
<p>「這又是算什麼呢？」董先生想，心裏着實地難過起來：「這種日子，把孩子們過得饞不算，把大人也變得小氣了。」</p>
<p>他於是把太太堆在他面前的肉片又給每個孩子夾了一塊在他們飯碗上。</p>
<p>「爹爹吃好了。我們不要吃。」明明懂事地說</p>
<p>「你們吃吧！」董先生心裏在流淚：「我每天在行裏吃飯，也還可以吃着一塊兩塊的。」</p>
<p>太太在旁邊苦笑一下</p>
<p>孩子們可歡欣了，明明立刻一口就吞掉那片肉；阿保照他往常的例子，咬成許多小塊，一槐一塊地吃。第三個，小妹，她把那片肉埋在碗底。打算最後一口吞下去。或者還可以含嘴裏，一直到她要把它嚥下去的時候。</p>
<p>至於毛頭，那個最小的男孩子，他吃了一口飯，把那塊肉放在嘴裏舐一下又吐出來。再吃一口飯，再放在嘴裏舐一下吐出來……</p>
<p>爲了這，桌子上起笑聲。</p>
<p>「髒死了！」阿保說：「鼻涕也倘到嘴裏。」</p>
<p>可是董先生看了却直想哭。她想到，他對待他底孩子們該多殘酷，正如這世界上的人們對待他一樣。他給孩子們吃肉，像一個慈善家似的。可是又不給他們吃個痛快。可憐！每個人就只分着那麼兩小小片，還要看了母親的多少眼色。</p>
<p>想到這裏，他眞想抱住他底孩子們大哭一頓，或者立刻再買上十斤八斤的肉讓他們吃個痛快。</p>
<p>不是麼？在吃完了飯，毛頭跑到他面前來，正經地問：</p>
<p>「爹爹，我們什麼時候再吃肉呢？」</p>
<p>做爹爹的人把孩子抱起來，眼眶喪有點濕了。</p>
<h3>砂粒</h3>
<p>— 耶瑪</p>
<p>走過吹着風沙的街，我感到了生之倦怠。</p>
<p>人們都舉起袖子，在眼前擋住風沙。怕風沙迷糊了他們的眼。</p>
<p>我提着疲憊的脚，睜着酸痛的眼，在經過了一天的生之戰鬥以後，走過黃昏的風沙的街，回到自已休息的地方去。</p>
<p>一顆砂粒吹進了我底眼，趁我沒有提防的時候。</p>
<p>我感到有一點刺痛，用手指揉揉眼，淚水出來了，沙粒仍刺痛着我底眼。</p>
<p>於是，我只得停留在路口，手指用力地揉着眼，想用淚水擠出砂粒。然而沒有用，我的眼睛反而被淚水迷糊了。</p>
<p>「我不能停留在這兒，我得走。」</p>
<p>夜色已瀰漫在街心了，再不走，天將更晚。我揉着眼，不顧砂粒的刺痛，又走上了生的途程。</p>
<p>街上刮着漫天的風沙。</p>
<h3>梅</h3>
<p>— 默之</p>
<p>街上刮着漫天的風沙。</p>
<p>默之</p>
<p>我願作梅花，</p>
<p>骨如冰，</p>
<p>芳氤氳，</p>
<p>在這嚴酷的冬日，</p>
<p>疏影獨立，</p>
<p>爭迎新歲。</p>
<p>雪飛來，</p>
<p>替梅花披上棉絮，</p>
<p>增　　寒冷，</p>
<p>增強了它的勇氣，</p>
<p>英姿更奮發。</p>
<p>然而，</p>
<p>雪花是冷靜的，</p>
<p>飛來了，</p>
<p>祗片刻的溫情，</p>
<p>悄悄的別了。</p>
<p>梅花依然堅挺，</p>
<p>骨枝嶙峋，</p>
<p>顧影自憐。</p>
<p>寒芳永久散放，</p>
<p>紅瓣都凋零，</p>
<p>願化作春水，　隨雪逝去。</p>

<h3>三屆籃球聯賽，精彩迭呈　談中北華聯今晚大戰　評述華聯汕隊一役</h3>
<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>申報盃籃球甲組中北華聯並列冠軍，故兩隊究屬是誰強，極爲一般球迷所矚目。茲者三屆籃球，聯賽人甲甲組第一循環之最後一場，將於今晚在西靑球房舉行，中北華聯俱挾三戰三勝之常勝榮譽相會，於是此一幕令人注意之大賽，勢將演出空前盛况，當局爲易於維持秩序起見，票價大事提高，亦無辦法中之辦法，不足苛責而言有背普遍之原理也。筆者爲增加興趣起見，對兩隊之近况，及應取之陣容及戰術，略作申述。供兩隊之參考，助球迷之話頭。</p>
<p>包松圓助中北陣容齊近況好</p>
<p>中北在申報盃克服華聯後，球興加倍濃厚。及至此番加入三屆聯賽，練習甚殷，故各隊員之近况，均稱良好。又華影隊之暫時停頓後，車遙安譚永湛即相繼投奔該隊，茲華影主將包松圓新近由蘇　來申，亦聞風來歸，且已在戰汕隊一役中露臉，頗覺包之作風與北派極稱合拍。由此中北之陣容，堪稱整齊。中北目下以隊員之氣足充實，故絕對取人針人戰術，地位已熟，遝用用亦慣，故此戰當仍有超越之表演，考其陣容之佈排余以爲應如下列：</p>
<p>卓國榮　包松岡　陳學祟　沈聿恭　李震中</p>
<p>所以我贊成排此陣容者，一方面確爲最理想者。一方面亦有與對方人頭有制止之效。除聿恭之左鋒無從更動外，以學崇爲中鋒。蓋華聯中鋒吳成章有出將入相之材，年富力强，而以學祟體力之够，經騐之足，庶幾能與之死拚到底，最多彼此犧牲。則實有利於中北，而切斷對方之連繫。震中看黑人勃脫，有特殊之成績，然此次華聯所用陣容，或將菊生爲左鋒，當可以試用包松圓。則以包之球藝老練，身體玲瓏，亦有看煞菊生之可能。進而言之，以震中爲前鋒，前鋒錢上，多一主腦中心人物。攻勢方面，可以增加不少。重用卓國榮，當爲對方右鋒勃脫善竄而勇，如以賓中守之，難免遭受犯規之累。而阿卓人短小易於阻止竄進者。故余以爲當然應先以此陣容上場，順則莫論，不然者，寳中雅林均隨時可以人替，好在有汪隊長戴指導之善謀，我人决可看到其隨機應變之嘗試也。</p>
<p>華聯報仇機會定必圖新發展</p>
<p>申報盃一箭之仇，華聯藥今晚良機，自圖報復。領隊張溎祥以鑒於必須採用人釘人，否則難以言勝，而用人釘人術，又必須長力充沛者才能應付到底，故驟然試用新陣容。除中鋒吳成章外，其餘位置，均加調動，此點足以證明張君之腦筋淸淅，絕非墨守者可比。另一方面，亦可知華聯等之人材衆多，不然者調度有心將材缺乏，必感辣手無策矣。致言其今日應用之陣容，筆者可其用二個陣容：</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>范慶公</p>
<p>張良雄</p>
<p>吳成章</p>
<p>徐菊生</p>
<p>勃脫</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>勃脫</p>
<p>瞿錫麟</p>
<p>吳成章</p>
<p>徐菊生</p>
<p>范慶公</p>
<p>所謂第一陣容，即爲該隊戰汕隊時所用，頗覺在合作方面及其支配方面，毫無缺憾，是則當有繼續應用之必要。但筆者以爲應戰中北就對方之將材及球路，乃敢貢獻所謂第二陣容。吳之中鋒不談，以聿恭之經騐及怪手，雖以良雄之近况尚可，然其身材及彈性與夫熟悉聿恭之球路三者而言，實不若用錫麟之爲勝。以勃脫爲左衛，所以制震中也。藍震中旣曾費力以看煞勃脫，孰謂勃脫便無法與震中相鬥，以牙還牙，此其時矣。前鋒用菊生，因菊生之進步，雖對方爲包松圓，斷無因噎廢食之理。况菊生之角度擲籃，亦俱威脅長包之力量。用范慶公爲右鋒，取其卓國榮或有對慶公之球路尚未純熱，或能收意外之成功。結論，所謂陣容（一），大致爲華聯挺用者。所謂陣容（二），乃筆者所期望者，未　領隊張溎祥若何？但余信其或必有更新之發展，以饜我人。</p>
<p>評華聯勝汕隊過程異常緊張</p>
<p>本週三華聯克服汕隊之役，表演出神入化，變方均用緊逼人釘人制，以故戰情每一分鐘在緊張中渡過，實爲年來少見之一塲好球賽也。</p>
<p>張溎詳慧眼識英雄</p>
<p>評論之焦點，便先佩服張溎祥之慧眼。我人可回憶當北星遠征滬上，張君即羅致范慶公，而是時范之表演，固未見出色。及後加入華聯後，亦無特殊之成績。迺者，此番在與汕隊一戰，張君以范言守對方之林維聽。緣林爲汕隊獲分之　，以此重用付託，老范究然發揮充分力量，使小林　手縛脚。汕隊得分乏人，慘敗之主因也。於是慶公是籃球英雄，而張君誠慧眼識英雄，必爲大衆所信任之事實矣。</p>
<p>徐菊生有顯著進步</p>
<p>菊生年來並不重用，上屆始終列於後備軍地位，此次一經張若試以正式，固然奮發有爲，埋頭苦幹，果爾一日千里，已恢復其全盛時代之雄姿。其角度射籃，絕少失的，實與沈聿恭右異曲同工之妙。汕隊未能設法阻制，遂爲菊生隨心所欲，獲分累累，奠定勝局。唯菊生守人，易意氣用事，致造成犯規，故與汕隊之役，難逃四次罰出之災，理應用智避免。</p>
<p>以上兩點，爲華聯勝汕隊之主因，餘當爲全除之精神及努力，無容多贅</p>
<p>汕隊敗失之於經驗</p>
<p>汕隊雖敗，但能突然滲用人釘人與之周旋，實爲成功之嘗試。且在撞人一點，極多應用，又爲可取之處。其所以能予華聯如此之威脅，不無因也。失敗關鍵還是在少經騐。臨陣之初，除馬燦希外，均見慌亂。故上塲失分殊多，入後漸見鎮定，步步追上，終以前失分較多，亦受兩球之差，而遭敗續。有此成績，足以自豪。再假時日，汕隊之出人頭地，我敢云可無問題也。</p>
<p>拳擊大戰記</p>
<p>上星期日舉行的中西拳擊戰，展開了一幕刺激驚人的血戰塲面。賽前，拳擊選手個各的誰着擂　的兩隅，由報吿員高聲報吿雙方的姓名國籍與重量。隨後由裁判員的紹介了雙方作一種極有禮貌的握手與檢查皮手套的有無夾帶。鐘聲一響，平靜的臺面上，立刻變成肉搏的狹巷。</p>
<p>李培根被擊倒</p>
<p>這一次拳戰，最出人意外的是：李培根的被擊倒。使全座的國人觀衆，大大的失望。在事前聽說他是非常努力的鍛煉着。可是在毫上，第一回合中，就被對手維多一拳擊中頭部，盡搖的倒在　欄上，同時手足都發生痙　的怪現象，雙目直瞪瞪的失望着，變成白痴的模樣。李的出手，相當矯捷而有力，可是有勇無謀，不知守護自已的弱點，尤其是他的頭部的太脆弱，一生也受不住突然的襲擊。我們明知道他是業餘性質的演出，可是這樣脆弱的一擊而倒，實在是意想不到的，因爲維多出名是個庸碌的低能者。</p>
<p>「擊倒」在拳擊條例上，是失分最多。想不到這次拳戰，竟有三組人馬造成「擊倒」的紀錄，李培根是一例。再有一組就是溫諾古擊倒意僑但利社尼。以但利杜尼過去的戰績而論，可說是一員「長敗將」，很少見他的出色的鬥爭姿態。那一天也許天氣過冷，他一上峯，阿有幾手，脚便扭傷了筋，痛得他眼淚都掉下來，似乎與「擊倒」互爲因果。不過但利社尼四個字，在拳擊圈中很快的要被人遺忘。李培根也難述這公例</p>
<p>羅根斯坦的勝希維索夫，是很費不少力氣的。他倆職了六個回合。雙方都不肯讓步，戰來精彩。黃毛高洛皮夫與菲僑石維亞的競技，雙方的個子非常滑稽，一高一低，戰未有些格，不相入。緊張的空氣，就爲了高低的差別怪相，變得特殊的鬆懈。亞歷石夫也以六回合的奮戰，打敗了十七的合維，在戰鬥的過程上，很有些熟烈的勇狠表現。</p>
<p>開塲第一戰由林忠孚戰德僑香海，兩人都很賣力。在前三回合中，林忠孚佔盡上風的局面。在末一回合中幾乎被人擊倒，結果演成和局，在同人心目中，很是滿意的表現。</p>
<p>壓軸戲頗緊張</p>
<p>壓軸大戰，是波僑加達坦地的得慧傑作。他以過去戰勝的餘威，擊倒德僑山姆劉古。劉古也以百折不撓的精神，周旋到底，也是值得每個在座的觀衆欽佩的。因爲他倆共戰十回合，普通都是二分鐘一回合，壓軸是要三分鐘一回合，非要有相當實力不可。最初二回合中，雙方互有勝負。第三回合中，坦地以極巧妙的手法，擊中劉古，跌倒在台上。等到裁判員數到了第「九」字上，（按拳擊規則：墮地後，裁判員一二三數至第十不能起立者敗）他又氣昂昂的站起來再戰。這樣的苦戰了五六回合，劉古的鼻血流流滿面，坦地的亂髮紛披在額上。他倆完全忘了人性，一味的憧憬在鬥爭的意識中，鬥着，打着。聽到了停戰的鈴聲才歇手。助手把冷水淋澆在頭上，蘇醒他昏亂的神思，阿摩尼亞的氣息，冲開了鼻竅，追回了已忘去的理智。鈴聲重響，再度又展開鬥爭的局面。在這一點，强弱的分野就可瞭然於胸了。果然，在最後第十回中，坦地以退爲進，迫到劉古在角落裏，一拳擊中了頭顱，砰的一聲倒了，劉古這一次是得有勇氣再站起來了。坦地終於獲取勝利，不愧是全中國華爾德級拳王的榮銜。</p>
<p>聽說，各將這次拳擊大賽的負責人聲稱，下一决坦地將與岩本合戰，决定這華爾德級錦標，究竟是鹿死誰手。</p>

<h3>Intense Fighting on Luzon Island: Japanese Elite Forces Bravely Counterattack, Firmly Defending the Front Line to Stop Enemy Advance</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese army has been using blitz tactics to penetrate the flanks of the American bridgehead in Lingayen Gulf. On the 28th and 29th, they reportedly killed or wounded 72 enemy soldiers, captured one tank, ten machine guns, one heavy machine gun, and 1,600 rounds of ammunition. On the 31st, they engaged in a seesaw battle in the Kompu area near Los Baños and the eastern Batangas Pass. Simultaneously, the Japanese army in the central Luzon plains echoed this effort, repelling the American forces attacking Manila towards Kalumpit by evening, pushing them back to the Guiguinto area. At the same time, a 500-man Japanese suicide squad launched a surprise attack on an American mortar battery six kilometers southwest of Muñoz, destroying several mortars. Japanese elite forces also attacked the Clark Air Base area, disrupting the flanks of the American forces advancing on San Fernando and engaging in fierce battles with enemy troops in their rear. The Americans, after utilizing Leyte, Mindoro, and other locations, are now urgently constructing airfields in Lingayen, Bauang, and other places, intending to use the air power from these bases and the carrier-based aircraft of the naval mobile forces to implement a covering operation, with tank-led ground forces advancing south. On the evening of the 29th, the enemy attacked San Fernando with two tanks and 200 soldiers, but were ultimately repelled by the Japanese army. By the 31st, five American battleships, 35 destroyers, and 25 transport ships had approached the waters west of Batangas. On the morning of the same day, the enemy also landed a significant number of troops on the Subic Bay area in the northern Bataan Peninsula, making the Luzon war situation increasingly tense.</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Newly landed enemy forces near Subic Bay and the west coast of Batangas continue to attack fiercely, attempting to invade Manila from the northwest. The enemy armored units previously advancing south from San Fernando have moved through Caloocan and entered Bulacan Province, advancing to within 40 kilometers of Manila. Japanese forces in the Batangas west coast area are engaging the enemy near Aka, ten kilometers east of Nasugbu, where the enemy landed, and fierce fighting is ongoing. In the Clark Field area, Japanese elite forces have been conducting heroic attacks against an enemy armored division since the 25th. Up to the 30th, the enemy's losses include 293 enemy bodies left behind, 14 tanks stranded and on fire, and the capture of five automobiles and numerous other artillery pieces and heavy weapons. The morale of the Japanese soldiers is increasingly high, and they are currently fighting bravely. In the Cabanatuan area, the Japanese army has blocked the enemy's advance along the Manila highway, firmly defending the Cabanatuan front line. As for the Japanese forces in the Rosales-Agat area, they are still fighting fiercely in close combat, forcing the enemy to yield. The enemy's movements are extremely inactive, and their advance has been blocked. To break through this difficult situation, the enemy is intensifying its attacks with the aid of the air force, using the four airfields in Lingayen, San Fabian, Dagupan, and Manaoag to assemble approximately 300 B-25s and other types of aircraft in an attempt to operate.</p>
<p>Luzon Front Base, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the battles on Luzon Island, the American forces have no clear objectives, indiscriminately bombing everything, regardless of cities or forests, and recklessly attacking under the cover of tanks. To achieve this goal, the American forces not only use these inhumane methods but also bomb hospitals, schools, and churches. On January 30th, six enemy B-29s indiscriminately bombed the Pope's residence and a hospital in Babatngon, 60 kilometers east of Baguio, injuring five nuns and many hospitalized patients. Enemy aircraft even dared to fly at low altitude, repeatedly bombing hospitals clearly marked with the Red Cross. The weather that day was clear, and even from a very high altitude, the distinct markings on the ground could be clearly seen. The fact that the American enemy carried out such atrocities has aroused the indignation of the local people.</p>
<h3>Thai Prime Minister Convenes Political and Military Conference</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – At 10:00 AM on the 1st, Thai Prime Minister Abhaiwongse convened a conference attended by 180 high-ranking government officials and senior military officers. During the meeting, the Prime Minister clarified the fundamental principles of Thailand's domestic and foreign policies, the main points being as follows: Thailand will fulfill its obligations to foreign countries and abide by agreements, adhering to a principle of complete sincerity, treating public matters as public, and implementing domestic policies. During wartime, the authorities should share political responsibility. I deeply hope that everyone will be self-aware, diligently fulfill their duties, and strive for the interests of the nation and the people. The current government is determined to promote politics based on the constitution and under the principles of democracy. Therefore, officials and military personnel should frankly express their opinions, and I will fully respect their opinions. I myself am willing to make any sacrifice for Thailand and the Thai people and hope that everyone will abandon their personal positions and accomplish great things.</p>
<h3>Indian Provisional Government Appoints New Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between the Japanese and Indian governments, the Indian Provisional Government has decided to appoint Kataji Minami, a colonel in the Indian National Army and a non-appointed cabinet member, as the exclusive Minister of Foreign Affairs. The appointment was announced in the gazette on the 2nd. In the past, the position of Foreign Minister was concurrently held by Chairman Bose due to the special nature of the Provisional Government of Free India.</p>
<h3>Burmese Wartime Cabinet Decides to Establish Supreme National Defense Council: Ba Maw's Representative Issues Important Statement</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Following the reorganization of the Burmese wartime cabinet, the first cabinet meeting was held on the 1st, issuing a statement urging 16 million Burmese to rise up and making various agreements regarding the current extraordinary situation. After the cabinet meeting, National Representative Ba Maw announced the establishment of a Supreme National Defense Council and national defense propaganda, with the following main points regarding various policies: (1) A Supreme National Defense Council will be established soon, with Prime Minister Ba Maw as the chairman, to promptly implement various policies related to the war. (2) The positions of governors of the Mandalay, Bassein, northwest, and northern regions will be abolished, and political affairs officers will be reappointed, expanding their administrative authority to improve administration in areas close to the enemy. (3) To strengthen the economic cooperation between Japan and Burma, a new agency will be established to enhance the state of economic cooperation between Japan and Burma in order to issue an independent Burmese currency. (4) New intelligence agencies will be established in areas close to the enemy to carry out local propaganda and reporting, as well as to contact the Japanese army on the front lines, crush enemy schemes and propaganda, and educate the general public.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – National Representative Ba Maw issued a statement on the 1st after the end of the first cabinet meeting: Today, the country of Burma is facing a major situation that will determine the fate of the nation, and the enemy British army is attempting to counterattack Burma. They are now continuously invading Burmese territory. In order to uphold our glorious independence and protect our homeland, we must do everything in our power to stop the enemy's invasion. The establishment of the new cabinet is to bear the responsibility under this major situation. Hereby, in the position of the wartime national cabinet, I solemnly vow to the Burmese people: First, the new cabinet is the national government that represents the Burmese people and will faithfully serve the people. Second, the new government is determined to cooperate with the Great Japanese Empire and the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to complete the war for Burmese independence. Third, with the assistance of Japan, we will strive to improve the political, social, and economic status of the people. At the same time, we ask all Burmese people to cooperate with the government. This war is the war of Great Burma. Therefore, all Burmese people must cooperate with all their strength in the war. Our independence is the independence of Great Burma. The victory of the Greater East Asia War is the victory of Burma. Only then will Great East Asia have peace and prosperity, and we will be able to realize a Burma for the Burmese.</p>

<p>Weekly Commentary</p>
<h3>Preface to the Japanese Book "Analysis of the Chongqing Regime"</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>Someone said to me: "As the saying goes, nothing lasts forever. You have been painstakingly studying the political trends in China in Shanghai for ten years. Surely you have some unique insights that you can share for those who are concerned about current affairs?" Others often say that the longer you live in China, the less you understand it. People who come to China for the first time form a general view of China within two or three years. After that, no matter what Chinese problem they encounter, they always try to explain it with this concept, that is, they try to adapt to the ever-changing phenomenon with unchanging prejudices. It is okay to think this way in their own minds, and it is even okay to use it to impress newcomers and boast about being an expert on Chinese issues. However, when dealing with Chinese people in a practical manner, they suddenly become clueless and encounter obstacles everywhere. Then they feel that their previous understanding of China has been completely overturned and they cannot cope. They dismiss the phenomena they do not understand as absolutely "unknowable" and leave it at that. There must be many people who have had this experience while living in China. I think the reason is as follows:</p>
<p>The majority of the Chinese people are farmers, and their lives remain largely unchanged. Seeing only this aspect, and then saying that "China is the medieval Europe of today," or "The Chinese are a nation living in the seventeenth century in the twentieth century," is correct. Then they hastily draw a dogmatic conclusion. They believe that since the Chinese are economically two or three centuries behind, they will not go wrong if they deal with them politically based on this "brilliant idea." Based on this view, they make various "efforts" towards the Chinese. However, the result is like "scratching an itchy shoe," a futile effort. China is only as gentle as a sheep, as silent as an ox, listening to the torrent of explanations from the Japanese, but never expressing the kind of mental reaction that the Japanese expect. Then the Japanese should conduct another self-examination. Why do the Chinese not have a mental reaction? Isn't our "effort" expressing opposition through silence? Assuming that this is unfortunately true, how do the Chinese acquire this ability to discern? If we research forward based on this question, we will reach enlightenment on the China issue. In short, ninety percent of the Chinese population is illiterate and cannot even write their own names. However, those who guide them politically are intellectuals with thirty years of experience in national revolution and a broad political vision. They do not live a stable political life like the Japanese, but have grown up under the oppression and deception of many foreign powers that the Japanese have never experienced. Therefore, they have a level of political sophistication that the Japanese cannot imagine. They have experienced democratic revolutions and even proletarian revolutions. It is these progressive intellectuals who are guiding the backward masses and forming the "Chinese nation" of today. Thinking of this, we can feel the complexity of the issues involved. However, if we think about this complexity further, we will realize that the complexity of the China issue is not simply composed of domestic factors, but reflects the struggles and compromises of various countries in the world, and is constantly changing. Therefore, the China issue cannot be understood without constant effort and research. Especially recently, the China issue has become increasingly difficult to fathom because the interests of various countries in the world are intertwined like a tangled mess. Even though it is extremely Machiavellian and complex, the one who can untie the "tangled mess" of East Asia must be Japan. Let me say something that others may consider unprofessional: Japan's main enemy is currently attacking from the east, but Japan's main sword is stabbing westward. This is truly puzzling. Just as Alexander cut the "tangled mess" with a quick sword before launching his eastern expedition, if Japan can untie the "tangled mess" of East Asia with decisive action and then shift its troops eastward, the victory of the Greater East Asia War can be assured.</p>
<p>Based on this view, I have been immersed in studying Chinese issues, especially the Chongqing regime issue, for the past half year. The results of my research have been published in the Shen Bao. However, I have received an unexpected response. Not only did the Shen Bao publish them, but the New China Daily, the Mainland New Daily, the New People's Daily in Beiping, the Great Chu Daily in Hankou, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Daily in Jinhua all competed to publish them one after another. This may be the most impactful work by a Japanese in the past decade. However, I myself know better than anyone that these essays are not outstanding works. The only merit is that I observe Sino-Japanese relations with an objective attitude and want to sincerely discover a solution to the Greater East Asia War with the Chinese. In another sense, this can be said to be a self-criticism by the Japanese regarding the Sino-Japanese Incident. The ultimate victory of a war, to be honest, is the victory of the war's guiding theory. Mencius said: "To conquer is to rectify. Each wants to rectify himself. What is the use of war?" Therefore, I believe that the greatest task of cultural figures today is to constantly engage in self-criticism regarding the nature of our current war and to gradually improve our war guiding theory.

<h3>Japanese Troops on the Yuehan Railway Line Advance Towards Nanxiong</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from the Yuehan Front, 3rd: Japanese troops, in two contingents north and south of Shaoguan, are fiercely attacking Nanxiong, a wing of the Suigan airfield 100 kilometers east of the Yuehan Railway Line. They are expected to capture it in one fell swoop soon. Afterward, they can coordinate with each other to complete the strategic encirclement of the Suigan airfield. The American forces stationed there will be on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Enemy Suffers Heavy Blows</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a mainland base, 3rd: As a result of the Japanese army's fierce offensive, Suichuan, the central hub of the American Air Force's forward base in Chongqing, has finally fallen. Consequently, the so-called Suigan area airfield cluster is gradually collapsing under the heavy pressure of the Japanese army. The enemy's coastal defense is also losing ground accordingly. It is reported that the American air base in the Suigan area, centered on Suichuan, 200 kilometers southeast of Hengyang, is composed of Ganzhou, 70 kilometers southeast, Xincheng, 100 kilometers south, Ji'an, 100 kilometers north, Zhijiang, and other important areas, plus mobile airfields in Jian'ou, Fujian Province, and Nanxiong, Guangdong Province. This configuration aimed to bomb the South China coast and Taiwan, and disrupt sea traffic routes. However, due to the Japanese army's Guangxi campaign, the enemy feared being cut off from its rear supply lines and temporarily retreated, destroying the expansion work, which was half-completed, at the Xincheng and Jian'ou airfields and rarely using them afterward. The Suichuan and Ganzhou airfields still relied on air supply, and activities became more intense. Especially when the enemy invaded the Philippines, the area actively engaged in supplying fuel and ammunition with large aircraft. At the same time, enemy aircraft in the area often operated with about 100 fighter-bombers. Moreover, when the enemy mobile fleet appeared in the South China Sea a month ago, it also provided support and implemented diversionary operations. Originally, the enemy fighter squadron stationed there was a considerable nuisance to the American Air Force on the mainland. It had exerted its final effectiveness in the previous diversionary operation. Its importance in the war cannot be ignored. Therefore, the fall of the Suichuan forward base was a very deep blow to the enemy.</p>
<p>US Admits to Weak Defenses</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 3rd: According to a dispatch from Chongqing: General Wedemeyer, commander of the American forces in the China theater, met with a group of reporters on the 1st and spoke about the Japanese army's new operation to complete the clearing of the Yuehan Railway and sweep away the remaining air bases in that area. He also believed that most of the American air bases east of the Yuehan Railway would soon be occupied by the Japanese army operating in South China. He stated that the defenses in this area were very weak and that the Japanese army's action was foreseeable because the American forces stationed in Chongqing had used it as a base to cover the operations in the Philippine Islands, given that the Japanese army had not occupied it initially.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Health Formulates Smoking Cessation Methods for Smokers</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd: In order to provide smokers in various regions with a unified method of smoking cessation and accelerate the process, the Ministry of Health has formulated methods for smoking cessation and examination. These have been printed and distributed to hospitals兼理戒烟醫院 (concurrently managing smoking cessation) in various counties for compliance.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Mobile Warfare Enters New Phase: Soviet Offensive Encountered at the Warta River</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Transocean News Agency reports: The focus of General Zhukov's offensive is on the strongly defended cities of Schneidemühl and Posen, in the entire Warta River area. The mobile warfare north of the Warta and Warthe rivers has entered a new phase. Since the Soviet vanguards reached various points on the Warta River, the Soviet army is now forced to deploy its troops on a large scale. The changing climate requires the pursuing Soviet forces to continue advancing on the Warta and Warthe rivers, which is completely different from fighting on frozen ground. In addition, the transportation of all supplies is facing extreme difficulties. Therefore, the war has temporarily become calm, giving the German command an opportunity to implement countermeasures. The Warta River line will become an obstacle to the Soviet army's future, which was not anticipated by the Soviet command. The Soviet's fierce offensive has been stopped here. The fact that Zhukov's troops encountered strong German resistance in the Küstrin area proves that the German countermeasures have also been effective there.</p>
<p>Soviet Right Wing Forces Close to Schwerin</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: According to a German military reporter: The extreme right wing of Zhukov's army has approached a point 47 kilometers from Schwerin.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Silesia</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Transocean News Agency reports: In Silesia, the Soviet army has once again attempted to break through the Moravian Gate, but most of the attempts have been repelled. The main force is advancing between Beuthen and Pleß. Before the attack, the Soviet army bombarded with artillery and aircraft. The Soviet troops who broke into Diedersdorf were forced to withdraw from the outskirts after hand-to-hand combat. The Soviet army launched local offensives at the Küstrin bridgehead, and fierce fighting also occurred at the bridgehead west of Stalau. As a result, the German army is in an advantageous position.</p>
<p>German Army and Civilians Cooperatively Defend Berlin</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 3rd: According to a Berlin broadcast on the evening of the 2nd: Berlin is now full of barbed wire. The National Storm Troopers defending the city are fiercely training day and night. The noise of tanks and mechanized units shakes the streets. Another report states that the outer defense line of a certain city is now ready. Young and capable commanders trusted by Führer Hitler are personally leading stormtroopers and elite members of the Hitler Youth to await battle.</p>
<h3>Alsace Warfare Turns Fierce</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Transocean News Agency reports: The fighting in Alsace is now becoming more intense. There is also fierce fighting north of Strasbourg. The American Seventh Army launched a new offensive east of Bitche and in the direction of Mouterhouse. At the same time, the anti-Axis forces are also increasing pressure on the German salient in Upper Alsace. The enemy wants to break into the Rhine River between Achenheim and the Colmar Canal to separate the German bridgehead. The enemy clearly has the intention of encircling the city of Colmar from the northeast. Most of Eisenhower's troops are now concentrated in the central and northern routes, especially in the Aachen area, where it appears to be the focus of a major future anti-Axis offensive.</p>
<h3>Site of the Three-Headed Conference Not Revealed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Bern, 2nd: German News Agency reports: According to United Press news from New York, the Three-Headed Conference began on the 2nd, but the location of the meeting has not been announced.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Stockholm states that, according to a New York correspondent for the "Daily Mail," news from London and Cairo carried by American newspapers confirms that the Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt conference is underway. The correspondent also confirmed that within hours of the start of the conference, a joint declaration will be issued to the German people, announcing the terms and form of "unconditional surrender." The correspondent continued, stating that former U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles gave a speech explaining that the Three-Headed Conference is in progress and expressed his belief that the decisions made by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin would answer the question of whether to organize an international organization to replace the League of Nations. In light of the various political failures since the start of the "liberation" of Europe, Welles believes that such an international organization must be established as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Polish Issue Included on the Agenda</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 3rd: The Polish issue, which was the spark for the European war, is reported to be included as a major agenda item at the Three-Headed Conference. Currently, there are two regimes in Poland. The London-based government-in-exile claims to be the legitimate Polish government. Until the end of last year, before the Lublin government received Soviet support, the Polish government-in-exile was confident that it was supported and protected by Britain and the United States. However, after the birth of the Lublin government, this confidence was fundamentally diminished. Britain and the United States, fearing a deterioration in relations with the Soviet Union, have taken a non-committal attitude towards the two Polish regimes. At the same time, the Lublin regime has consolidated its position by seizing the opportunity to infiltrate Warsaw and other reasons. From any point of view, it is necessary to recognize that the issue of Poland's legitimate government may be the focus of discussion.</p>
<h3>American Ships Mostly Used in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 2nd: German News Agency, Washington: Britain and France have recently sent a note to the highest American military authorities, strongly protesting against the American military's dispersal of combat power in the two oceans. The biggest objection in the protest letter is the American military authorities' decision to use a large portion of ships in the Pacific theater. Officials in Washington expect that a secret understanding has been reached on the new allocation method for ships.</p>
<h3>Japanese Interests in Turkey to Be Managed by Switzerland</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: The Japanese Foreign Ministry announced on the 2nd: Following the exchange of notes between Japan and Turkey, the representation of Japanese interests in Turkey, Iran, and Iraq has been officially entrusted to the Swiss government.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Issues Temporary Relief Bonds to Adjust Rice Prices and Supplement Charitable Funds</h3>
<p>The draft regulations and repayment schedule for the issuance of temporary relief bonds by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government have been approved and retroactively recognized by the 144th meeting of the Central Political Committee. To clarify the contents of the bond regulations and the repayment method, a Central News Agency reporter visited the municipal government to obtain details as follows:</p>
<p>Amount and Use of Issuance</p>
<p>In December of last year, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, based on a recommendation from the Municipal Advisory Committee, decided to issue temporary relief bonds. The purpose was to adjust the city's rationed rice prices and supplement the city's charitable relief funds. The bonds are named "Shanghai Special Municipal Republic of China 34th Year Temporary Relief Bonds" and have a total value of 150 million national currency. They will be issued in one batch, with two-thirds used to adjust rationed rice prices and one-third used for various charitable relief funds throughout the city. The bonds are scheduled to be issued on New Year's Day of this year. The denominations are 1 million, 500,000, 200,000, 100,000, 50,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 1,000 yuan, all unregistered.</p>
<p>Interest Payment and Repayment Method</p>
<p>The annual interest rate of the bonds is set at 1.2%, with interest paid twice a year on May 31 and November 30. The bonds will be repaid in five years using a lottery method. Interest will be paid in the first year only. From the second year (i.e., the 35th year of the Republic of China), principal will be repaid in two tranches per year, with 15 million yuan repaid each tranche, fully repaying the bonds in five years. The aforementioned repayment will be held at the Municipal Government on May 10 and November 10 each year. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Audit will be dispatched to supervise. Bondholders and citizens are free to observe the lottery. Payments will begin at the end of each month. The bonds are designated to use the city's special consumption tax revenue as the repayment fund. The Municipal Finance Bureau will allocate monthly average amounts according to the principal and interest schedule, depositing them with the Central Reserve Bank and the Shanghai Special Municipal Fuxing Bank, crediting them to the account of the Bond Fund Management Committee for disbursement. In the event of a shortfall in a certain month, the Municipal Government shall immediately allocate a sufficient amount from other revenue items to make up the difference, without delay.</p>
<p>Fund Management Committee</p>
<p>The Bond Fund Management Committee will be jointly organized by one representative each from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Audit, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Finance Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Money Shops Association, and the Central Reserve Bank, as well as two members of the Advisory Committee. The bonds can be freely bought and sold, mortgaged, and used as guarantee deposits, public reserve funds, and for market transactions. The matured principal and interest tickets can also be used to pay municipal taxes.</p>
<h3>Chinese Company Passenger Ship Indiscriminately Bombed by American Aircraft</h3>
<p>The repeated indiscriminate bombing of unarmed ships and Red Cross ships by American aircraft has aroused public indignation around the world. However, such inhumane acts by American aircraft have recently become even more frequent. It is reported that the ×× ship of the Shanghai Chinese Shipping Company was bombed by American aircraft in broad daylight, resulting in over seventy passenger deaths and injuries. On the afternoon of January 16, the ship was carrying over 220 passengers, sailing upstream on the Yangtze River somewhere. However, when it reached ××, four enemy aircraft suddenly attacked from the north, strafing with machine guns at low altitude before flying west. An investigation revealed that 31 passengers and 3 crew members were killed, and 43 passengers and 2 crew members were seriously injured. Captain Zhu survived unharmed. According to Captain Zhu, the ship had hundreds of bullet holes, with slight damage to the wheelhouse, passenger cabins, and steam pipes. Since the ship had no weapons on board at the time, they could only await death. We will never forget such inhumane actions by American aircraft and will surely take revenge.</p>
<h3>Press Conference of the Propaganda Department: Education Issues Raised, Director Dai of the Education Bureau Attends to Answer</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Department convened its second regular press conference with reporters from various newspapers in the city at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 3rd). Dai Yingfu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, along with Secretary Dai Wangren and Chief Supervisor Pan, arrived on time. Liu Dexuan, Director of the Propaganda Department, presided over the meeting. Dai answered various questions regarding tuition fees, teacher salaries, and public education. The meeting adjourned after two hours. Excerpts of the Q&amp;A are as follows:</p>
<p>Question Regarding Teachers in Public Elementary Schools</p>
<p>(Q) Can the municipal normal school students be assigned as volunteer teachers to the city's public morning schools, with a small allowance for transportation expenses? This would not only solve the teacher problem but also provide practice opportunities for normal school students.</p>
<p>(A) The establishment of public morning and evening schools in this city and the flexible use of the system are to provide general public with the opportunity to receive education, which is undertaken by the school teachers of the affiliated morning schools for the purpose of saving expenses. As for assigning normal school students as voluntary school teachers, the time and transportation costs are uneconomical. Normal school students regularly have teaching practice, and if they are assigned to public education work, it may not be easy to carry out.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Rationing Has Been Submitted to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>(Q) The teachers are excited to hear that cotton cloth rationing will be arranged for teachers and staff. What is the progress?</p>
<p>(A) The priority rice rationing for teachers and staff has been completed. Teachers and staff are in great need of cloth, so a special rationing request has been submitted to the Municipal Government, which has forwarded it to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan should instruct the Bureau of Commerce and Trade to handle it. As for the rationing method in the future, relevant agencies will be requested to handle it jointly to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>(Q) Teachers are supposed to receive rice rations twice a month, totaling three dou (a unit of dry measure), and have never been delayed. However, only one ration was issued in January, and the second has not yet been issued. What is the reason for this, and will it be re-issued in the short term?</p>
<p>(A) I asked Director Liu of the Materials Distribution Office yesterday, who said: "The rice rations have not yet been received. Once they arrive, they will be distributed immediately."</p>
<p>(Q) The new semester is about to begin, and it is said that it is difficult for students to purchase nationally standardized textbooks. They have to resort to the black market, which increases the burden on parents. Does the Education Bureau know about this, and how will it reduce this black market?</p>
<p>(A) In order to save resources, the Ministry of Education instructed the Education Bureau to draft regulations for the management of textbooks, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for record. The distribution of textbooks is handled by the China United Publishing Company entrusted by the Ministry of Education and is not related to this bureau. The pricing is also set by the Ministry. I have investigated the black market situation, but bookstores deny it. It may be that wholesalers are illegally profiting from it. We are currently trying to eliminate this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Handling of Non-Compliant Fee Collection</p>
<p>(Q) Currently, many private schools are charging registration fees that do not comply with the Education Bureau's regulations. What strict enforcement measures does the Bureau have? The Bureau announced that private school tuition fees are to be paid in two installments, but some schools are not complying. What measures does the Bureau have to deal with this?</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the tuition fee issue, the Bureau has discovered that many schools are not complying with the regulations. The persons in charge of these schools have been summoned for discussions and ordered to refund the fees. However, some schools are still doing so. I will personally urge the persons in charge of each school to comply with the municipal government's orders. At the same time, we are preparing to use 20 million as subsidies for private schools. Although this estimate has not been approved, it is being prepared. If any school continues to collect tuition fees in violation of municipal government orders, it will be investigated and reported to the Mayor for action. If there is a reason why tuition fees must be increased, as long as the Bureau sends someone to investigate and it is true, it may be permissible. However, the atmosphere in Shanghai is too bad, and they often imitate each other. The tuition fees charged by private universities in this city are very high, and the Education Bureau cannot manage them (because it is managed by the Ministry of Education), but it indirectly affects the amount of fees charged by primary and secondary schools. We are currently trying to deal with it.</p>
<p>(Q) Is the small collection of tuition rice by various schools to meet the needs of rural areas considered a flexible measure? Will teacher salaries still be based on rice prices, or will a half-rice, half-salary system be adopted?</p>
<p>(A) The Ministry of Education has not permitted it.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Increased Agricultural Production in Various Regions in the 34th Year (2)</h3>
<p>(Continued from the first page of this newspaper on January 30)</p>
<p>(3) Construction of Demonstration and Contracted Farms: 1. Demonstration Farms: This year, for cooperative societies and branches that have already been established and are newly improved, a subsidy of 2,500 yuan per mu (a unit of area) is planned to enrich their equipment, so as to provide farmers with on-site observation and to collect excellent seeds. 2. Contracted Farms: This year, for mutual aid societies and farms established by farmers under contract, a subsidy of 1,500 yuan per mu is planned to expand their scope and enrich their internal resources, so that under the guidance of cooperative societies and promotion associations, they can plan the cultivation, improvement, and collection of excellent seeds for rice, wheat, oil, vegetables, and sugarcane.</p>
<p>(4) Guidance, Encouragement, and Assistance in the Cultivation of General Major Food Crops: 1. Rice Cultivation: The improvement of rice cultivation practices should be fully understood and universally adopted by farmers. This year, in order to concentrate efforts and achieve the greatest effect, 100 townships are specifically selected within experimental counties for implementation, and close cooperation is established with village construction service centers. Cooperative societies actively provide guidance and promotion to achieve the goal of improving agricultural techniques. The methods are as follows: 2. Improvement of Cultivation: According to the rice cultivation regulations, village construction service centers assist cooperative societies in guiding seed selection, sowing, fertilization, and improvement, and hold seed appraisal meetings and rice product appraisal meetings in various counties. Those with good results are given commendations and rice cultivation improvement awards. A subsidy of 100,000 yuan is given to each township for this work. 3. Prevention and Control of Rice Stem Borers: According to the growth period of rice stem borers, village construction service centers assist cooperative societies in mobilizing villagers and elementary school students to engage in the prevention and control of rice stem borers by appropriate methods. A subsidy of 800 yuan is planned for each township for this work. 4. Wheat, Rapeseed, and Utilization of Fallow Land: The superior wheat seeds planted by cooperative demonstration farms last year should be distributed to contracted farmers and core farmers this year. Farmers should be guided and encouraged to implement strip sowing methods. Furthermore, the improved methods of fertilization, cultivation, weeding, etc., for wheat should be promoted by promotion associations and core farmers to general farmers and implemented in various experimental counties. Efforts should be concentrated and specifically implemented.</p>
<p>Utilization of Space Land: This year, it is planned to utilize 15,000 mu of vacant land, with a subsidy of 600 yuan per mu, to actively promote the increased production of crops such as sugarcane, rapeseed, and wheat.</p>
<p>(1) Rectification of Experimental and Research Institutions: The Central Agricultural Experimental Institute was originally the highest institution for agricultural experimentation and research. This year, personnel should be strengthened, equipment should be expanded, and reorganization should be carried out to become a model for agricultural experimentation and a center for agricultural technology improvement.</p>
<p>(2) Establishment of Seed Collection and Demonstration Work: The agricultural improvement experimental areas established by the Ministry of Industry in various locations originally numbered more than 30. Last year, in order to concentrate funding and manpower, they were merged and consolidated to enrich their content. The Yanziji Model Experimental Area of the Ministry should be used as a model experimental area and activity center. Furthermore, the agricultural improvement experimental areas established in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai are planned to receive a subsidy of 360,000 yuan each this year to promote seed collection and demonstration work.</p>
<p>(3) Enrichment of Mutual Aid Societies: Mutual aid societies are organizations of village self-governance and are the most important cells for the implementation of agricultural technology improvement and agricultural production increase. Last year, as a result of the active organization and promotion by cooperative societies, promotion associations, and the China Cotton Production Improvement Association, approximately 4,200 societies have been formed. This year, in order to actively engage in activities and achieve the expected results, it has been decided to focus on enriching the mutual aid societies that were established last year. Only 270 new societies need to be established in the designated counties and districts for increased production implementation, for a total of 4,500 societies, with each society receiving a subsidy of 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Enrichment of Mutual Aid Societies: More than 5,000 people have been trained last year, and another 1,000 will be trained this year, mostly in the designated counties and districts for increased production implementation. The training method is the same as last year, divided into three times in spring, summer, and autumn, with each training lasting 10 days. The training key points are to make farmers understand the meaning of agricultural production increase and the knowledge and skills necessary for agricultural production increase, to make them the core cadres of promotion associations and mutual aid societies, and the vanguards of agricultural production increase, with a subsidy of 1,500 yuan per person for training expenses.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the Development of Wasteland and Utilizers of Idle Land: Encouragement of Wasteland Reclamation: This year, it is planned to reclaim 8,000 mu of wasteland, with cooperative societies, mutual aid societies, and other relevant organizations as the main promoters, with a subsidy of 1,200 yuan per mu, to actively promote the increased production of sweet potatoes and wheat.

<p>Reader's Scholarship News</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Collects One-Yuan Bills: Key Transportation Points, Zonal Collection, Turning Small Amounts into Large Sums, Transferring for Educational Assistance</h3>
<p>This newspaper published Mr. Chen Shao-wei's proposal on January 19th, "Collecting One-Yuan Bills to Aid Education." The original letter stated: "Recently, prices have soared, and one-yuan bills and fractional notes are almost useless. Using them, no one is happy to accept them. Discarding them casually is a pity! How about placing a small box at the entrance or by the wall of your esteemed organization, allowing people to put small notes in it? Waiting for the accumulation of sums to be used as aid money, the number may be quite considerable..." Mr. Chen is an economist, and his proposal is very appropriate. Just looking at the above few words, it feels very commendable. After careful consideration by the colleagues in this newspaper who are dedicated to aiding education, it has been decided to adopt his valuable proposal. The methods are: (1) Select key transportation centers throughout the city to set up several "One-Yuan Bill Collection Silver Boxes" (locations will be announced later) to facilitate citizens to put in bills at any time. (2) All fractional notes below one yuan, considered useless by citizens, are welcome. (3) If any enthusiastic ladies collect small notes worth over one hundred yuan and wish to have their names published, they can wrap the collected one hundred yuan with paper, marking their name and the number of bills. This newspaper will publish it accordingly after inspection. Other odd amounts will be published collectively. (4) This newspaper will send staff to collect small notes from various locations before 6 PM every evening, check them clearly, and publish them publicly the next day for credibility. In addition to collecting small notes, accumulating small amounts to make large sums, and turning small amounts into whole sums to enrich the educational assistance fund, the main purpose of this initiative is to create a universal atmosphere of aiding education, extending it to make all Shanghai citizens have the mentality of "cherishing material resources" and "being good at giving generously." In the past, people who donated to scholarship funds were limited to a very small number of middle-class people. Wealthy people were unwilling to donate money, and poor people were unable to donate money. Only this initiative, regardless of wealth, is a force for donating and helping others. Small notes below one yuan, no matter who or which family, can be said to be everywhere. If everyone in Shanghai donated one yuan, then the total of four million yuan could very likely become a reality.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Money Transferred to Aid Education</p>
<p>The Four Sisters Café Music Hall wrote: "Regarding the opening of our café music hall, we were honored to receive generous gifts from prominent figures in society and friends from all walks of life. A total of 155,600 yuan was received in gift money. 50,000 yuan has already been allocated to the Zhongshan School for the Deaf and Mute. The remaining 105,600 yuan will be donated to your newspaper and the News (Xinwen) Newspaper's scholarship funds. Attached is a check for 52,800 yuan. Please verify and acknowledge receipt."</p>
<p>Welfare Association Allocates Funds to Aid Education</p>
<p>Chen Fukang, Director of the Shanghai Hunnan Citizens Welfare Association, wrote: "Regarding the attached report on the revenue and expenditure of the Association's previous garbage disposal, which has been reviewed and verified by accountant Shen Hao, we hope that it will be published in the social service column of your esteemed newspaper to show credibility. Also attached is 30,000 yuan in national currency, which is donated to your newspaper for educational assistance purposes. Please verify receipt and issue a receipt."</p>
<p>Movie Stars and Singers to Perform Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Four Sisters Café Music Hall at the Pudong Building on Great Shanghai Road will hold a movie star singing concert on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, starting at 2 PM and 8 PM. Gong Qiuxia, Chen Qi, Zhang Fan, and Chen Juanjuan will be the main singers, combining music, song, and dance in one place to earn a percentage of the business, which will be allocated to the News (Xinwen) Newspaper and the Tai (Great) Newspaper's scholarship funds. Yesterday, both day and night performances were sold out, with outstanding performances. The music hall predicts that today and tomorrow will be even more enthusiastic. It is truly a grand event of entertainment that does not forget to aid education. Furthermore, there are many programs scheduled, and it may be necessary to exceed the prescribed business hours. It is said that the authorities of the two newspapers have already obtained special permission.</p>
<p>Various Schools Set Up Free School Places</p>
<p>(1) Alumni of Jiaotong, Daxia, St. John's, Soochow, and other universities, in view of the high tuition fees charged by various schools recently, which has caused many young students to lose their opportunity to study, jointly founded Shengyi Middle School at Dehua Elementary School, No. 42, Lane 1218, Daxing Road. Temporarily, there are four classes of the first and second grades of junior high school, starting in the spring and autumn, with 40 places in each class. In addition to responding to the "Rescuing Students Who Lost Educational Opportunities" movement of the Shen (Shenbao) and Xin (Xinwen) newspapers and requesting them to guarantee the admission of 10 students in each class, there are still places available. The school is purely voluntary in nature, with all tuition and fees waived, and is exclusively for poor and needy children. Class time is from 5 PM to 8 PM every day. Registration will begin on February 1st, with registration time from 2 PM to 6 PM. The entrance examination will be held on February 10th, and school will begin on February 15th.</p>
<p>(2) Wanlan Middle School, No. 560, Caishi Road, has always been based on the principle of giving preferential treatment to outstanding students from poor families. Therefore, teaching and management are serious, and tuition fees are especially low. It is now planned to continue recruiting several male and female transfer students in the first and second grades of junior high school. Students with excellent grades and from poor families can request preferential treatment. The method is: if the total score is above 70 points and there are supporting documents, the tuition fee will be reduced by 2,000 yuan according to the original regulations (the original amount was 10,000). Furthermore, the school has already started on the 2nd of this month, and classes began on the 5th.</p>
<p>(3) The private Daode Elementary School at the intersection of Huashan Road and Wukang Road, in order to sponsor poor students, in addition to the original fee reduction and free places in each grade, the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association will generously provide 30 free and half-fee places each. Students whose families are indeed poor and who have excellent character and academic performance can apply for free admission.</p>
<p>(4) Jingxian Elementary and Middle School on North Shansi Road, in order to promote compulsory education and reduce the burden on parents, has specially added a number of half-fee and free students in each grade of elementary and middle school. Excellent students must be selected and sent by this newspaper. Classes will begin on February 5th.</p>

<h3>Finance Bureau Strictly Prohibits Private Solicitation of Fees</h3>
<p>Since Commissioner Luo assumed office at the Municipal Finance Bureau, he has actively reorganized tax collection and severely admonished subordinates to be honest and self-disciplined. Now, as the Lunar New Year is approaching, fearing that unscrupulous personnel may still solicit fees from taxpayers, he has dispatched personnel to conduct detailed investigations. Once verified, he will severely punish them according to the law to rectify discipline and clean up officialdom.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Painter Jiang Hanting</h3>
<p>— Huang Xuanweng</p>
<p>Changshu, with its beautiful scenery and flourishing literary style, has long been a haven for poetry and painting among the Su townships. For example, Qian Muqi and Jiang Tingxi were all elegant in diction and superb in brushwork. My friend Jiang Zihanting was born with extraordinary talent and a reclusive nature, and he loved painting from a young age. He painstakingly studied and traced the famous works since the Song and Yuan dynasties. From childhood to youth, and from youth to adulthood, he seemed to be reading in paintings.</p>
<p>I first met him at the home of painter Li Zuishi in Wumen. He had a sincere and simple expression, stuttering as if he could not speak. Zuishi said to me, "This is my painting friend Jiang Hanting, whom I fear." Zhang Zuishi's high imitations were rarely satisfactory to anyone in the world, but he respected Hanting so much that I admired him in my heart. Over the past twenty years, the world has changed repeatedly. In the year of Xin Si, I suddenly encountered him at the Daguan Art Garden in Shanghai. Hanting had reduced his youthful vigor, and I was already old and gray. I then learned that he had been playing with painting with Zhang Zizhong Yuan every day in recent years and gradually presented his "Hundred Birds Picture" for inscriptions. The strange and diverse birds seemed about to come alive, and he had become a master of realistic painting.</p>
<p>He recently opened a painting exhibition at Daguan Garden. All the paintings were exquisite. They were all sold out within a day, which shows that everyone appreciates them. Even a small piece of silk or paper becomes a treasure. Jiang Zi is almost worthy of it. In this turbulent time, when many people are treacherous and greedy, and painting is often no exception, Hanting can be quiet and self-possessed. Is he not one who "chews on the root and is not stained by the mud"?</p>
<p>Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, the municipal administration of this city has presented a new look. The citizens are united in their expectations for the revitalization of the municipal administration, and the authorities have repeatedly declared their determination. The goals of the officials and the people are exactly the same. However, how to further enable the officials and the people to cooperate and achieve the goals as soon as possible is indeed an essential step. This newspaper, on the one hand, will do its best to contribute, and has specially set up a "Shanghai Municipal Administration" column, publishing the authorities' intentions for municipal administration measures, the citizens' demands, the citizens' suggestions for municipal administration measures, and the authorities' demands. In order to communicate opinions, understand each other, and then cooperate together. It will be published every Saturday starting next week. We respectfully hope that the municipal authorities and citizens will write and send articles to this publication based on what they have heard, seen, and what they want to say. At present, the problem of dispersing the population is extremely important. We hope that readers will study and write articles on how to plan and how to promote it. Once published, we will send a small remuneration.</p>

<h3>Lieutenant Commander Shioda Talks About Three-Dimensional Naval Warfare: The Japanese Navy Presents a Completely New Look and Achieves Significant Results in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Recently, the highly capable elite air force of the Japanese Navy has repeatedly demonstrated great power on Luzon Island in the Philippines, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces. The number of enemy ships lost is increasing daily, truly opening a new chapter in naval warfare. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Lieutenant Commander Shioda of the China Fleet Press Department to inquire about the process of the Japanese Navy strengthening its organization and expanding its power. He graciously provided the following item-by-item answers:</p>
<p>Recent Situation in the Philippines</p>
<p>(Q) What is the latest situation in the evolution of the Philippine battle situation?</p>
<p>(A) The Pacific war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, and the center of operations is in the Philippines. Recently, the Japanese Army and Navy fought fiercely against the enemy and achieved significant results, and the battle situation has already been reported, so I will not repeat it. However, the recent battles are slightly different from the past. The Japanese Navy has recently focused on its elite air force to fiercely attack the enemy. Therefore, the current operations are actually battles with the air force as the primary principle.</p>
<p>(Q) Although the Japanese Navy in the Philippines has achieved significant results, it has not yet been able to completely destroy the enemy's ships. Some people think that the Japanese Navy has not been active enough. Why is that?</p>
<p>(A) The Japanese Navy in the Philippines has not yet achieved very significant results. This is a matter of time. It is not entirely true to say that it has not been active enough. It should be known that the Japanese Navy, in addition to ships, also has the most powerful air force, which attacks the enemy day and night. At the beginning of this year, Prime Minister Koiso said: "The current Japanese Navy is not the navy of the past, but a powerful force jointly composed of the sea and air." Based on this point, it should be known that the power of the Japanese Navy is even greater than before.</p>
<p>New-Style Navy</p>
<p>(Q) Could you tell us about the outline of the composition of the modern navy?</p>
<p>(A) The power of the modern Japanese Navy lies in its ability to exert the maximum power of its air force. In the past, in the Russo-Japanese War and the Battle of Jutland between Germany and Britain in the First European War, naval operations relied solely on main battleships and cruisers. Therefore, the weapons used by both sides were limited to various types of ships, and the outcome was determined by the extent of fleet losses. Even in recent years, the naval issue at the Washington Conference focused on the naval power of various countries. As for modern naval warfare, it has gradually become three-dimensional. The organization of the old-style navy has really become useless. The so-called new navy must possess a strong air force in order to be able to control the victory.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the new look of the Japanese Navy?</p>
<p>(A) In order to adapt to modern naval operations, the Japanese Navy has a completely new look. In addition to possessing the powerful power of giant ships and giant guns, it has also participated in the air force with superior power, and its organization is truly complete. Recently, in operations, ships are used to protect sea lanes, and on the other hand, the air force is the main force to launch attacks on the enemy, exerting great power.</p>
<p>Future Outlook</p>
<p>(Q) What are your thoughts on the outlook for the Japanese Navy?</p>
<p>(A) The construction of the new navy, with air force power as the primary task, has already been described above. As for the construction of aircraft carriers, although it is also needed, it will still need to be limited in the future in terms of facts. The US Navy originally focused on giant ships and giant guns, and is now also strengthening its air force power. However, its concept remains unchanged, thinking that it can exclude Japan from the world by possessing a huge navy. This kind of arrogance is not worth laughing at. It should be known that the strength of the Japanese Navy is constantly consolidating. Even if the United States uses all its strength to build ships and attack Japan, the Japanese Navy will definitely deal with it and does not need to be afraid. The fact that the Japanese Navy has repeatedly exerted its power in various places in the Pacific recently and gradually destroyed the enemy's ships can be a clear proof. The Japanese Navy now possesses powerful ships and air force power, and it will be as easy as breaking bamboo to destroy the enemy in the future. (Grace)</p>
<h3>The Glorious Achievements of the Kawashima Guerrilla Unit</h3>
<p>The guerrilla unit, composed mainly of the Gaosha tribe, under the command of Major Kawashima Takenobu, waited for the US military to attack on Morotai Island. This guerrilla unit made use of the battle training of Guadalcanal, Az, and Saipan, trained quickly and fiercely, and with the determination to make the enemy shed the greatest amount of blood even if all of them were killed in battle, risked the bombing of enemy planes, unloaded ammunition and food, moved people into the dense forest, and completed the guerrilla posture. The hardships and bravery of fighting in the dark, night-like dense forest area of the island is self-evident.</p>
<p>At dawn on September 15, a US military transport fleet escorted by aircraft carriers suddenly appeared near the east and west banks of the Cape of Gila, and immediately began frantic naval gun fire, followed by the sudden landing of about one division of enemy soldiers, who immediately began construction of the Darha airfield.</p>
<p>The time to exert the true meaning of vanguard attack warfare finally arrived. A part of the Kawashima guerrilla unit immediately attacked the enemy's airfield construction team, and within five days up to the 20th, the enemy army left behind 200 dead and more than 200 wounded, and finally drove the enemy soldiers out of the Darha airfield.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Japanese Army Headquarters in the Halmahera Island area dispatched the 1st Assault Europe commanded by Lieutenant Nakajima and the 2nd Assault Team led by Lieutenant Iwasaki, as well as the 3rd Assault Team commanded by Lieutenant Kushi to land on Morotai in order to assist the Kawashima guerrilla unit.</p>
<p>After receiving the reinforcements, the Kawashima guerrilla unit, from 1 to 8 October, first destroyed the enemy's positions and facilities near the Rotararamo airfield, and then rushed into the enemy's camp, crushing its intentions. After that, the headquarters again dispatched the first reinforcement unit, which, together with the main force of the Kawashima guerrilla unit, began to attack, posing a great threat day and night, especially after the successful surprise attack on the enemy's encampment near the Piro village 10 kilometers south of Huaxiabobra on the night of October 20, the use of the enemy airfield became increasingly restricted.</p>
<p>In this way, from October 20 to 25, the damage suffered by the enemy army was: at least 600 casualties, 17 barracks destroyed, and more than two covered positions destroyed.</p>
<p>At this time, the newly arrived Morita unit of the Japanese army was waiting at the base to assist Morotai Island. Finally, on November 16, they landed under cover of darkness, and as a result, without losing a single soldier, they joined forces with the Kawashima guerrilla unit, which was outnumbered and continued to fight.

<h3>Song of the Japanese Army Air Force in the Philippines</h3>
<p>"You are the Divine Sky Attack Force"</p>
<p>(1) Cherry blossoms compare to men</p>
<p>The butterfly is a virtuous wife</p>
<p>Splendid cherry blossoms</p>
<p>Eight corners under one roof praise famous flowers</p>
<p>(2) Tomorrow leads the charge</p>
<p>The military sword reflects the moonlight</p>
<p>Splendid cherry blossoms</p>
<p>I am also generous like fallen flowers</p>
<p>(3) Japanese cherry blossoms sprout</p>
<p>Blooming in Asia</p>
<p>Splendid cherry blossoms</p>
<p>Play the triumphal song to welcome the dawn</p>
<p>(4) Invincible storm petrel</p>
<p>Coldly ride the long wind</p>
<p>Splendid cherry blossoms</p>
<p>You are the Divine Sky Attack Force</p>
<p>The author of this song is Luo? Unknown. But it sounds very good when sung. In the decisive battle in the Philippines, the young warriors of the Japanese Air Force Special Attack Team, every time they departed, from the unit commander down, sang the above lyrics together with generosity, smiling as they boarded their planes and flew away from the base.</p>
<p>"You are the Divine Sky Attack Force." What a great feeling these warriors must have as they sing a homemade heroic song and go on the expedition! The tune of this song is the prelude to the "Camping Song." But in the last verse, the melody goes down instead of up. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun on the 14th)</p>
<p>Map of the War Zone in Southern China</p>
<p>In mid-last month, the Japanese army in Southern China launched a fierce offensive against the southern section of the Yuehan Railway with a surprise attack, and occupied Zhaoguan on the 24th. At the same time, another part of the Japanese army occupied the Suichuan Airfield and important places such as Chen County and Lechang. At this point, the Yuehan Railway was completely under the control of the Japanese army. This time, the Japanese army's opening of the Yuehan Line not only had the effect of assisting the silkworm in the consistent warfare on the mainland, but also directly enhanced the defensive transportation capacity of the coastline along the South China coast, and made it more active. The Japanese army will be able to deal with the enemy's landing attempt more easily.</p>

<h3>Meat</h3>
<p>— Hou Qianli</p>
<p>A'bao, carrying a vegetable basket, returned from the market with his mother. As soon as they entered the door, he shouted:</p>
<p>"Come and see, Mom bought meat today!"</p>
<p>So the children, like a gust of wind, all squeezed into the kitchen. The four children surrounded the table, their eyes wide, staring at the basket. Their mouths were chattering.</p>
<p>"We're eating meat today!"</p>
<p>"Mom, how are we going to cook it? How about braising it?"</p>
<p>The mother's anger flared up.</p>
<p>"Haven't you ever eaten meat before in your previous life? Go away! Hasn't anyone ever seen meat? Why are you making such a fuss?"</p>
<p>Then she dragged a thin strip of meat from the basket and threw it hard onto the table with a "thud!"</p>
<p>The children didn't dare to speak, but still stared unblinkingly at the strip of meat.</p>
<p>"All of you, get lost! If you stand here, you won't get any to eat later!"</p>
<p>But the children still didn't move, as if they already knew this was just a threat.</p>
<p>"Did you hear? — Hey! Bingyan, come and scare these little worms!"</p>
<p>Mr. Dong Bingyan was lying in bed reading the newspaper, so he stood up.</p>
<p>As soon as the children heard their father's footsteps, they all ran inside in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>The father went to the kitchen instead.</p>
<p>"How much is this?" he pointed to the strip of meat on the table.</p>
<p>"Half a catty. Three hundred dollars! Really, what's there to eat?" His wife was cutting the meat into small pieces.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the fact that today was Sunday, and also Mr. Dong's birthday, she really wouldn't have spent three hundred dollars to buy half a catty of meat. Even this time, it was Mr. Dong who suggested it first.</p>
<p>"Here's five hundred dollars." Last night, just before going to bed, Mr. Dong suddenly took out a few bills. "Buy some meat tomorrow for everyone to eat. The children haven't had any meat in a long time."</p>
<p>"Don't bother eating it." His wife didn't agree. "Didn't you say you wanted to buy a pair of socks?"</p>
<p>But Mr. Dong's mood was particularly good because it was his birthday.</p>
<p>"The socks can wait. Besides, this is extra money. We closed the books late, and everyone in the bank got a bonus. Buy some meat, and something else too, braise it, perfect."</p>
<p>And so, when she went to the market today, the wife, unusually, cut half a catty of meat.</p>
<p>The children were greatly excited. Even though they weren't allowed in the kitchen, they still stood at the doorway with great curiosity, secretly watching how their mother was preparing it, their mouths still chattering:</p>
<p>"Oh! It's already half past eleven!"</p>
<p>"Mom, what time is lunch?" Mao Tou asked.</p>
<p>"There won't be time to braise the meat!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! There's plenty of time. It's okay to eat a little later, what does it matter?" The little sister said like an adult.</p>
<p>"Mingming is starving to death," A'bao said.</p>
<p>"I'm not starving," Mingming said, showing he did not care: "What's so special about eating?"</p>
<p>But after a while, he couldn't help but ask:</p>
<p>"Little sister, guess how much meat there is today?"</p>
<p>"Three catties!" Little sister guessed.</p>
<p>"Half a catty!" A'bao shouted. "Three catties? What are you dreaming of?"</p>
<p>"A'bao, what do you like to eat?" The older brother, Mingming, asked. "I like to eat meat skin!"</p>
<p>"Meat skin." A'bao disagreed. "It's awful! I want to eat the fatty part!"</p>
<p>"I want to eat the lean part," the little sister said. "Lean meat is better than fatty meat. Fatty meat is all oil, what's the point?"</p>
<p>"I want to eat big pieces," Mao Tou also chimed in.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's not ready yet!" Mingming became anxious. "It's already twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>Waiting and waiting, they finally made it to lunchtime. The children were busy again, busy setting the table, serving the rice, and running back and forth. Letting the adults know they were busy helping with the meal.</p>
<p>The mother brought the meat over, and Mao Tou and his little sister followed behind, shouting like messengers:</p>
<p>"Oh! The meat is here, the meat is here!"</p>
<p>The whole family sat down around the table. On the table, placed in front of the father, was a bowl of braised pork.</p>
<p>"Mom, how many pieces does each person get today?" A'bao asked hopefully.</p>
<p>"Eat, eat, eat!" The mother scolded. "Just eat! Don't look so poor. … It's better to be poor in life than to look poor! I hate this kind of look, as if you've never eaten meat in your entire lives!"</p>
<p>The children looked at their father and mother, only caring about eating their rice mouthful by mouthful, not daring to reach for the meat.</p>
<p>Mr. Dong Bingyan, seeing this, really didn't feel very good. Things were expensive, making the children look so pitiful, they didn't even dare to eat the vegetables.</p>
<p>He picked up a piece for each of the children and put it on their rice.</p>
<p>Mr. Dong suddenly remembered when he was little, how happy he was. He ate meat every day, and his mother made it especially for him. He remembered that he wasn't like these children now.</p>
<p>"Meat is so rare now," he said to his wife and children. "Back then, we didn't even want to eat meat. I often said, 'Mom, let's eat something else, don't just eat meat.' The next day, the family would kill a chicken. Meat, no one really wanted to eat it. It was for the servants to eat."</p>
<p>The children listened enviously to their father's good fortune, thinking, I wish I had been born back then.</p>
<p>Suddenly—</p>
<p>"Ah, ouch!" A'bao shouted.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" His father looked at him.</p>
<p>"Mingming hit me!" A'bao looked at the brother who was only one year older than him.</p>
<p>"He already ate one piece of meat." Mingming recounted A'bao's crime. "He wanted to take another one."</p>
<p>"I didn't take any meat." A'bao defended himself. "I went to get 　　."</p>
<p>"You're still lying, I saw it with my own eyes." Mingming even made a face. "Shameless."</p>
<p>"What do you mean shameless? You yourself!"</p>
<p>"Stop arguing!" The mother threw the bowl onto the table, her face darkening. "Listen to yourselves, what are you like?"</p>
<p>The children didn't dare to speak again.</p>
<p>Mr. Dong suddenly felt a wave of sadness.</p>
<p>He felt that it was all his fault as a father, making the children so greedy. But who could he complain to? A few years ago, although his salary wasn't this high, he could still buy some meat every Sunday. During the New Year and holidays, he would let the children eat their fill. And they never made such a fuss about eating meat, as if they were eating some kind of delicacies.</p>
<p>"Really," he thought, "what does eating such a small amount of meat even matter? It's not like we're eating anything good."</p>
<p>The wife was stirring the dish, picking out the few pieces of meat from the bottom of the bowl, piling them in front of him, and then looking at the children.</p>
<p>The children immediately lowered their heads and ate their rice heartily.</p>
<p>"What is this even supposed to be?" Mr. Dong thought, feeling truly sad. "These days, not only are the children greedy, but the adults have become stingy too."</p>
<p>So he picked up the meat slices that his wife had piled in front of him and gave each child another piece on their rice bowl.</p>
<p>"Dad, you've had enough. We don't want to eat it," Mingming said sensibly.</p>
<p>"You eat it!" Mr. Dong was tearing up inside. "I eat at the bank every day, and I can still eat a piece or two."</p>
<p>The wife smiled bitterly beside him.</p>
<p>The children were delighted. Mingming immediately swallowed the piece of meat in one gulp. A'bao, as he always did, bit it into many small pieces, eating them one piece at a time. The third one, the little sister, buried the piece of meat at the bottom of her bowl, planning to swallow it in the end. Or maybe she could keep it in her mouth, until she had to swallow it.</p>
<p>As for Mao Tou, the youngest boy, he took a bite of rice, put the piece of meat in his mouth, licked it, and then spit it out. Then he took another bite of rice, put it in his mouth, licked it again, and spit it out…</p>
<p>Because of this, laughter erupted at the table.</p>
<p>"It's so dirty!" A'bao said. "He even licked the snot into his mouth."</p>
<p>But Mr. Dong wanted to cry when he saw it. He thought about how cruel he was being to his children, just like the people in this world were treating him. He was giving the children meat, like a philanthropist. But he wasn't even letting them eat their fill. Poor things! Each person only got such two tiny pieces, and they had to look at their mother's expression so many times.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he really wanted to hug his children and cry, or immediately buy another ten or eight catties of meat and let them eat their fill.</p>
<p>Wasn't that so? After finishing the meal, Mao Tou ran up to him and asked seriously:</p>
<p>"Dad, when are we going to eat meat again?"</p>
<p>The father picked up the child, his eyes a little wet.</p>
<h3>Sand Grain</h3>
<p>— Ye Ma</p>
<p>Walking through the wind-swept street, I felt weary of life.</p>
<p>People all raised their sleeves, blocking the sand in front of their eyes, afraid that the sand would cloud their vision.</p>
<p>I dragged my tired feet, opened my sore eyes, and after a day of life's battles, walked through the sand-swept street at dusk, returning to my place of rest.</p>
<p>A grain of sand blew into my eye, catching me off guard.</p>
<p>I felt a slight sting, rubbed my eye with my finger, and tears came out. The sand grain still stung my eye.</p>
<p>So, I had to stop at the intersection, rubbing my eye hard with my finger, trying to squeeze the sand grain out with tears. But it was no use, my eyes were instead blurred by tears.</p>
<p>"I can't stay here, I have to go."</p>
<p>Night had already spread into the heart of the street, if I didn't leave, it would be even later. I rubbed my eye, ignoring the stinging of the sand grain, and walked back onto the path of life.</p>
<p>The street was swept by a sky full of sand.</p>
<h3>Plum Blossom</h3>
<p>— Mo Zhi</p>
<p>The street is swept by a sky full of sand.</p>
<p>Mo Zhi</p>
<p>I wish to be a plum blossom,</p>
<p>Bones like ice,</p>
<p>Fragrant and rich,</p>
<p>In this harsh winter day,</p>
<p>Sparse shadow stands alone,</p>
<p>Striving to welcome the new year.</p>
<p>Snow flies,</p>
<p>Putting cotton wadding on the plum blossom,</p>
<p>Increasing the cold,</p>
<p>Strengthening its courage,</p>
<p>Its heroic posture is even more vigorous.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>Snowflakes are calm,</p>
<p>Flying over,</p>
<p>Only a moment of warmth,</p>
<p>Quietly saying goodbye.</p>
<p>The plum blossom remains firm,</p>
<p>Bones and branches rugged,</p>
<p>Pitying its own shadow.</p>
<p>The cold fragrance is permanently released,</p>
<p>Red petals are all withering,</p>
<p>Wishing to transform into spring water, and disappear with the snow.</p>

<h3>Three Basketball League Matches, Excitingly Presented: A Discussion of Tonight's Great Battle Between Zhongbei and Hualian; Commentary on the Hualian-Shantou Match</h3>
<p>— Mei Jie</p>
<p>The Zhongbei and Hualian teams are jointly ranked champions in the Shenbao Cup basketball A group. Therefore, the question of which of the two teams is truly stronger is of great interest to the general fans. Now, the last match of the first round of the A group in the third basketball league will be held tonight at the Xiqing Gymnasium. Both Zhongbei and Hualian will meet with the honor of having won all three of their previous matches. Thus, this highly anticipated competition is bound to be an unprecedented spectacle. To maintain order more easily, the authorities have significantly increased ticket prices, which is a necessary measure and not something to be criticized as going against the general principle. To increase interest, I will briefly describe the recent situations of both teams, as well as the lineups and tactics they should adopt. This is for the reference of both teams and to provide talking points for the fans.</p>
<p>Bao Songyuan Helps Zhongbei's Lineup Complete, Recent Condition Good</p>
<p>After Zhongbei defeated Hualian in the Shenbao Cup, their enthusiasm for basketball doubled. As they joined the third league, they practiced very diligently. Therefore, the recent condition of each team member is said to be good. After the temporary suspension of the Huaying team, Che Yaoan and Tan Yongzhan successively joined Zhongbei. Now, Huaying's main player, Bao Songyuan, recently came to Shanghai from Suzhou and also returned upon hearing the news. It is felt that Bao's style is very compatible with the Northern style. Thus, Zhongbei's lineup can be said to be complete. Zhongbei currently has sufficient energy in its players, so they have mastered the art of targeting opponents with their tactics. Their positioning is familiar, and their movements are habitual. Therefore, they should still have an outstanding performance in this battle. Considering the arrangement of their lineup, I think it should be as follows:</p>
<p>Zhuo Guorong Bao Songgang Chen Xuesong Shen Yugong Li Zhenzhong</p>
<p>The reason I advocate for this lineup is that, on the one hand, it is indeed the most ideal. On the other hand, it also has the effect of restraining the opponent's players. Except for Yugong's left forward position, which cannot be changed, Xuesong should be the center. This is because Hualian's center, Wu Chengzhang, has the talent to lead and assist, is young and strong. With Xuesong's sufficient stamina and experience, he can fight him to the end, with at most mutual sacrifice. This would actually benefit Zhongbei and cut off the opponent's connections. Zhenzhong guards the black player Bert, and has had exceptional results. However, if Hualian uses Jiusheng as a left forward, then Bao Songyuan can be tried. Bao's ball skills are skilled and his body is agile, so he may also be able to suppress Jiusheng. Furthermore, with Zhenzhong as the forward and Qian Shang as another main brain, the offensive can be increased considerably. Zhuo Guorong should be given a heavy responsibility, as the opponent's right forward, Bert, is good at dashing and is brave. If Binzhong guards him, he will inevitably suffer from fouls. A-Zhuo is short and can easily stop his dashes. Therefore, I think we should definitely start with this lineup. If it goes smoothly, so be it. If not, Baozhong and Yalin can be substituted at any time. Fortunately, with Captain Wang and Instructor Dai's good strategies, we can definitely see their attempts at adapting to the situation.</p>
<p>Hualian Will Definitely Seek New Developments in This Opportunity to Avenge Their Defeat</p>
<p>Hualian is eager to avenge their defeat in the Shenbao Cup tonight. Team leader Zhang Weixiang believes that man-to-man marking must be adopted, otherwise it will be difficult to win. However, using man-to-man marking requires players with abundant stamina to cope to the end, so he suddenly tried a new lineup. Apart from center Wu Chengzhang, all other positions have been adjusted. This proves that Zhang's mind is clear and he is not comparable to those who are conservative. On the other hand, it can also be seen that Hualian has many talents. Otherwise, without talent despite the intention to adjust, one would feel at a loss. As for the lineup they will use today, I can propose two lineups:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Fan Qinggong</p>
<p>Zhang Liangxiong</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang</p>
<p>Xu Jiusheng</p>
<p>Bert</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Bert</p>
<p>Qu Xilin</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang</p>
<p>Xu Jiusheng</p>
<p>Fan Qinggong</p>
<p>The so-called first lineup is what the team used when fighting the Shantou team, which felt flawless in terms of cooperation and control. It is necessary to continue using it. However, I believe that to fight Zhongbei, considering the opponent's talents and playing style, I dare to contribute the so-called second lineup. Wu's center position is not discussed. With Yugong's experience and unpredictable moves, although Liangxiong's recent condition is acceptable, his height, elasticity, and familiarity with Yugong's playing style are not as good as using Xilin. Using Bert as a left guard is to restrain Zhenzhong. Lan Zhenzhong has worked hard to suppress Bert, so who says Bert cannot fight Zhenzhong? An eye for an eye, this is the time. Using Jiusheng as a forward is because Jiusheng has improved. Even if the opponent is Bao Songyuan, there is no reason to give up eating because of choking. Moreover, Jiusheng's angled shots are a threat to Bao's strength. Using Fan Qinggong as a right forward is because Zhuo Guorong may not be familiar with Qinggong's playing style, which may lead to unexpected success. In conclusion, the so-called lineup (1) is generally what Hualian is likely to use. The so-called lineup (2) is what I hope for. What will team leader Zhang Weixiang do? But I believe he will definitely have newer developments to satisfy us.</p>
<p>Commentary on Hualian's Tense Victory Over Shantou</p>
<p>In this past Wednesday's match between Hualian and Shantou, they performed incredibly. Both sides used tight man-to-man marking, so the battle was tense every minute. It was truly a rare good game in recent years.</p>
<p>Zhang Weixiang's Keen Eye Recognizes Heroes</p>
<p>The focus of the commentary is to first admire Zhang Weixiang's keen eye. We can recall that when Beixing远征沪上 [This likely means the Beixing team made a long journey to Shanghai], Zhang recruited Fan Qinggong. At that time, Fan's performance was not outstanding. After joining Hualian, he did not have any special achievements either. But in this battle with Shantou, Zhang had Fan guard Lin Weiting. Since Lin was the source of Shantou's points, Zhang entrusted him with this important task. Lao Fan played to his full potential, causing Little Lin to be tightly bound. The main reason for Shantou's crushing defeat was the lack of scorers. Thus, Qinggong is a basketball hero, and Zhang is truly a man with a keen eye for recognizing heroes, a fact that must be trusted by the public.</p>
<p>Xu Jiusheng Has Made Significant Progress</p>
<p>Jiusheng has not been heavily used in recent years. In the previous league, he was always listed as a reserve. This time, after Zhang tried him out officially, he worked hard and diligently, improving rapidly day by day. He has regained the heroic spirit of his prime. His angled shots rarely miss, which is similar to Shen Yugong's right-handed magic. Shantou failed to find a way to stop him, so Jiusheng was able to do as he pleased, scoring repeatedly and securing the victory. However, Jiusheng is easily impulsive when guarding people, which leads to fouls. Therefore, in the match with Shantou, he could not escape the disaster of being penalized four times. He should use his intelligence to avoid this.</p>
<p>The above two points are the main reasons for Hualian's victory over Shantou. The rest can be attributed to the spirit and effort of the whole team, which does not need to be repeated.</p>
<p>Shantou's Defeat Was Due to Lack of Experience</p>
<p>Although Shantou lost, their sudden use of man-to-man marking was a successful attempt. Moreover, they used a lot of bumping, which is also commendable. There is a reason why they were able to pose such a threat to Hualian. The key to their failure was still a lack of experience. At the beginning of the match, everyone except Ma Canxi seemed flustered. Therefore, they lost a lot of points in the first half. They gradually calmed down later, catching up step by step. In the end, they lost by a small margin due to the greater points they had lost previously. This result is enough to be proud of. Given more time, I dare to say that Shantou's rise to prominence is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Record of the Boxing Battle</p>
<p>Last Sunday's Sino-Western boxing match unfolded a stimulating and astonishing blood battle scene. Before the match, each boxer stood in one corner of the ring, and the announcer loudly announced the names, nationalities, and weights of both sides. Afterwards, the referee introduced both sides with a very polite handshake and checked for any concealed objects in their leather gloves. As the bell rang, the peaceful stage immediately became a narrow alley for close combat.</p>
<p>Li Peigen Knocked Down</p>
<p>The most unexpected thing about this boxing match was Li Peigen's being knocked down. This greatly disappointed all the Chinese spectators. Beforehand, it was said that he was working very hard to train. However, in the first round, he was hit in the head by his opponent, Victor, and shook before collapsing on the ropes. At the same time, he experienced strange spasms in his limbs, staring blankly with disappointment, looking like an idiot. Li's attacks were quite swift and powerful, but he was brave but lacked strategy. He did not know how to guard his weaknesses, especially his head, which was too fragile and could not withstand a sudden attack. We know that he is an amateur performer, but such a weak blow leading to a fall was really unexpected, because Victor is known to be a mediocre and low-energy fighter.</p>
<p>"Knockdown" results in the most point deductions in boxing regulations. Unexpectedly, three groups of people created "knockdown" records in this boxing match. Li Peigen is one example. Another group is Wen Nuogu knocking down Italian-Overseas Chinese Danili Sheni. Judging from Danili Duni's past record, he can be said to be a "long-term loser." It is rare to see his outstanding fighting posture. Perhaps the weather was too cold that day. As soon as he took to the ring, before he could show a few moves, he sprained his foot, and the pain brought tears to his eyes. It seems to be a cause and effect relationship with the "knockdown." However, the name Danili Sheni will soon be forgotten in the boxing circle. Li Peigen is no exception to this common rule.</p>
<p>It took Rohanstein a lot of effort to defeat Hyvisoff. They fought for six rounds. Neither side was willing to give in, and the battle was wonderful. The competition between Huang Mao Gao Lopif and Filipino Overseas Chinese Shi Weiya was very comical due to the difference in their heights; one tall, one short, their styles were incompatible. The tense atmosphere became unusually relaxed because of the strange sight of the difference in height. Alex Ishf also defeated Seventeen’s He Wei after six rounds of hard work, showing some intense bravery in the process of the battle.</p>
<p>The first battle of the day was between Lin Zhongfu and German Overseas Chinese Xiang Hai. Both of them worked very hard. In the first three rounds, Lin Zhongfu had the upper hand. In the last round, he was almost knocked down, resulting in a draw. The performance was very satisfying to everyone.</p>
<p>The Climax Was Quite Tense</p>
<p>The climax of the great battle was the performance of Polish Overseas Chinese Gada Tandi. With the residual power of his past victories, he knocked down German Overseas Chinese Sam Liugu. Liugu also persevered to the end with his indomitable spirit, which was worthy of admiration by every audience member in attendance. Because they fought a total of ten rounds, which are usually two minutes per round, the climax required three minutes per round, and could not be achieved without considerable strength. In the first two rounds, both sides had their wins and losses. In the third round, Tandi used extremely clever moves to hit Liugu, who fell to the stage. After the referee counted to "nine" (according to boxing rules: after falling to the ground, the referee counts from one to ten. If one cannot stand up after ten, one loses), he stood up again, full of energy, and continued to fight. After such a bitter battle for five or six rounds, Liugu's nose bled all over his face, and Tandi's messy hair fell on his forehead. They completely forgot about humanity and imagined only the consciousness of fighting, fighting and punching. Only the sound of the end bell stopped them. The assistant poured cold water on his head to awaken his confused thoughts. The smell of ammonia rushed into his nostrils, chasing back his forgotten reason. The bell rang again, and the battle resumed. At this point, the division of strength and weakness can be clearly seen. Sure enough, in the final tenth round, Tandi retreated and then advanced, forcing Liugu into the corner, hitting his head with a punch, and he fell to the ground with a bang. This time, Liugu managed to gather the courage to stand up again. Tandi finally won the victory, worthy of the honor of being the Chinese Walter-grade boxing champion.</p>
<p>I heard that the person in charge of this boxing competition stated that Tandi will next fight with Iwamoto to determine who will ultimately win the Walter-grade championship.</p>
