<h3>蘇聯向地下中海　謀擴展勢力</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　據倫敦方面引紐約時報消息：蘇聯當局曾於本週發表聲明，略謂：蘇聯在討論丹吉爾問題會議席上，應佔有一席地位。關於蘇聯之有此種企圖，蓄意已久，此種具有歷史性之野心，永遠不斷刺戟蘇聯人民，咎導「向地中海分力進取」。歷史指示蘇聯人民，「英國實阻聯彼等進取之途」，現英國勢力轉弱，蘇聯正可乘機一躍而起，實現彼等自古以來之野望，將地中海膩域予以一新變化。尤以此數週來，世人巳察見蘇聯對韃靼尼爾海峽及丹吉爾之動態，同時蘇聯又在巴爾幹半島托里埃　特。里文達·義大利·法國·西班牙作有　制性之暗中活動。目前丹吉爾在蘇聯目中，猶似一幅惑人之圖量，總之，爲經濟政治及戰略上之利害關係，蘇聯不得不對地中海之地位，予以特別關心。</p>
<p>蘇黨報抨擊弗朗哥政權瑞典京城七日中央社電　據莫斯科訊：蘇共黨機關報昨日著論，抨擊弗朗哥元首云，「前一股人正懷疑弗朗哥將軍如何能有此强大之力量，戰爭前及戰爭中弗朗哥始終盡力援助希特勒，而現在時機已至，我人應撲滅此種西班牙法倫琦主義者之政體。西班牙人民應乘機抬頭，復建一民主共和國，俾亦能參與新國際聯盟孫建設廳長報告計劃</p>

<p>西南總反攻聲中美渝共關係複雜</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　西南總反攻聲中，美軍何以不在華南登陸·以呼應渝方之內南總反攻，其中情形實異常繁複，然大略不出下出下列各種·茲列舉如次：</p>
<p>華南部登陸原因</p>
<p>國急於對日本本土登陸，　渝方之西南總反攻計劃，尚未至彼等所呼應充分準備之程度，　日軍對接岸作戰動員制迎　陣容，過於强大，　鑒於湘·桂作戰經驗，　指於陸上配備不論如何之優秀，航空勢力亦不能壓倒日軍優勢，　華南之地理條件。美軍如不於華南登陸，則渝軍決不能展開西南總反攻，此爲吾人所極明瞭者也。自湖南作戰至桂·柳作戰期間，渝野戰軍所蒙受打擊，殊爲重大，而於桂林喪失龐大兵工廠事，洵爲渝後方戰力削弱之主因。渝軍所以積極展開總反攻，不外因斯蒂威爾公路已復通，空軍及軍需品已於中國內地準備達相當數量之故，此種情勢，日軍早已洞悉，渝方之所以有呼應西南總反攻等等口號，不過係對美軍一種聊以盡責之空論而已。然渝軍及美軍之對日作戰計劃，依然繼續堅持，且美陸上部歐大量開入中國內地，設置渝美連絡官制度，並鼓勵學生及知識靑年從軍，竭力推進各種施策。</p>
<p>將校施美式教育</p>
<p>據六月六日重慶廣播種，號稱爲第一機動部隊之美軍，第四百七十五步兵師及第一百二十騎兵師，於五月自緬甸經空路到達中國戰綫，巳由駐　美軍司令部發表云云。前衝陽作戰時，日軍曾與美將校所指揮之機械化部隊交戰，又一次進入廣西後，亦有情報稱，有相當數目之美陸上部隊活動，然陸上作戰，並未見有大軍遺棄屍體一具，故大陸作戰，彼等始終使渝方爲前驅之犧牲者，而完遂其戰爭之企圖，更瞭如指掌。麥克沃塞會言，欲期完成戰爭使命，當利用中國龐大之人力，加以敎育訓練，成爲大量武裝軍隊，故必須極大之努力，因此遂向桂林西部之東南中美訓練團派遣德敎官安莫斯少將以下三百人之美國將校，對重慶中堅將校，實施美式敎育，該訓練團於桂林作戰前，已轉進貴州省內，繼續訓練。渝方最近學生從軍運動所號召之靑年，亦入該訓練團受美式訓練，總而言之，近一二年間，美國勢力以極高速度對中國侵入，現下重慶各種事業，如無美國勢力之援助及指導，則幾不能成立。現計美國化之重慶軍，緬甸遠征軍之半數約十師，中國陸空軍總司令部轄下約十五師，軍事委員會直　下五師，大約共有三十師左右，此外，各軍師部隊中亦經當各配有數十名美軍教官，使訓練成為美軍部隊之機能程度。</p>
<p>渝採大軍管區制</p>
<p>關於現重慶軍本身之內部陣營，因前湘桂作戰，其戰區已呈混亂狀態，例如張發奎之第四戰區幾完全喪失戰區能力，其後復於去年年末，迄今年年初間，始行從新建設戰區體勢，企圓再作蠶動。據稱，渝方現採用大軍管區制度，將第一，第二，第五，第八及第十戰區聯合組爲西北軍管區（司令部設於漢中），任李宗仁爲總司令。又將第三，第七及第九三戰區聯合組爲東南軍管理區（司令部設於鉛山），任　視同為總司令。又將緬甸遠征軍，騐桂湘邊區及滬越邊區聯合組成西南軍管區（司令部設於昆明），任何應欽爲總司令。按何應欽現兼任中國陸空軍總司令，故其就任此職，恐難免有錯覺發生，然其內容大耍如上。而據最近可翼之情報推測，以往各戰區陣容中之第一戰區司令蔣鼎交，業已更迭·起缺由副司令胡宗南升任。又以山東半島爲腹地之魯蘇戰區，于學忠於表面上與戰區無直接關係，並於安徽省南部迄九江之揚子江南岸上，已新設置第十戰區，由李宗仁部下之李品仙任司令畏官。因此，雖無顯著之變化，然據稱浙江以至江蘇兩省。業編爲新戰區，而頗堪注目之渝軍總兵力中，新編約有四師之「學生軍」。</p>
<p>渝軍政部長陳誠　曾斗言明，整理渝軍三分之一，約一百師，並強化其餘部隊之裝備，此種渝方之少數精銳主力機構，由於學生及智識靑年之從軍運動，漸次優秀化，是以渝方曾自豪謂，近將實現「靑年師」機械化部隊約三十師。按渝方之智識靑年從軍運動，始自去年六月之十萬從軍運動，至於徵募之動機姑且不論，其徵募成績大體尚屬良好，最近此等學生軍業已開往前綫，而寄身於日軍銳鋒正面·此等學生皆有優秀之裝備及愛國之至誠熱情，故其戰意及戰鬥秩序，皆爲空前所罕見。渝當局爲訓練敎育此等學生，會設立敎導團十團，並推蔣介石氏爲團長，羅卓英爲編練總監·蔣經國爲編成部長，此外，並聘用許多美軍教官，渝方為茲勵此等靑年，乃作種種標語，例如「放下書木，操起刀槍」，「戰塲猶如敎室」，「無國家知識何用」，此等靑年於未入伍前，即穿軍裝，且不守紀律爲所欲爲者，層出不窮，致使責任當局幾無適切處理辦法。</p>
<p>重慶與延安衝突</p>
<p>其次再以渝延衝突與在渝美空軍而言，大陸戰綫最近之特色，當推渝延兩軍於各地發生武力衝突及在渝美空軍之破壞日方交通路綫。按中國各地幾皆色亦色政治及其武裝團體，迨延安此次擴大政治勢力之際，此等團體一齊蹶起，並與渝軍各處演成正面衝突，是以延安軍極力　　與日軍發生正面衝突，此乃自民國二十八年移動於陝北以來，延安一貫所採之擴大地盤政策也。於是延安方面乃積極展開活動，首令突擊工作部隊南下，與土著延安軍取得聯絡，而實施其包圍工作之新綱領，以故渝方狼狽非富，最近於各地與此輩延安軍迎日交戰，蔣介石氏爲阻止南下至湖南之賀應麾下之突擊工作部隊，已指令第九戰區副私令長官兼第三十集團軍總司令王陸基，「暫時停止抵抗日軍，以阻止延安軍南下」。渝政權之長懼延安擴大勢力之甚，恐在吾人想像以上。抗戰各地之三民主義靑年團支部，澈底實施撲淢共產黨之敎育，而駐渝美空軍自第二十轟炸隊轉用於馬里亞納後，第十四航空部隊力主以從事航空作戰，又以p57，p40　等小型機連日遊擊於武漢地區及京漢·粵漢兩鐵道上空，以圖破壤交通綫，最近復以大型輪送機，機力運送兵員及資材，此事洵値注目也。</p>
<h3>日東部中小都市　首次造空襲　中部地區發生小火災</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之B29型約二百架，六日夜十一時半起歷四小時，來襲東部軍管區內，對於各中小都市施行燒夷彈攻擊，第一梯團約八十架，侵入甲府市，第二梯團約六十架，侵人淸水市，第三梯團約五十架，侵入千使市，各施行燒夷單攻擊，第四梯團約十架，於水戶市及　沛方而行動。甲府，千葉，，清水各市會中燒夷彈起火，但因軍官民防空陣之奮鬥，迄七日拂曉幾全部撲減，按敵機之攻擊東部軍管區中小都市，此爲首次。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　南方基地之敵B29型敵機約百十架，於六日下午十時半起，侵入中部軍管區，第一批由紀伊水道侵入，第二及第三批分別侵入海南市　南方地區及明石附近，施行燒夷彈轟炸，迄七日二時餘，始向南方逸去，以上各地雖發生火災，然損失不達。</p>
<h3>波蘭政府　推行新政</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　據華沙電：新波蘭統一政府刻首先決定接收在英之財產，並於倫敦設置委員會，負責接收此項財產，四日業經波蘭通訊社發表。關於此點，據消息靈通之入士觀測，倫敦之波蘭流亡政府堅持主張本身爲波蘭唯一合法政權，因此種問題致掀起一大波瀾。一方由於聯合各國已承認新政府，結果卡遜綫割讓與蘇聯爲代價，惟勘定德東部國境，將成爲當前莫大問題。波蘭現已派遣委員赴東普魯士·西部波大拉尼亞·西里西亞等地，與蘇軍協力負行政上之責任。新政府方面之波蘭民主主義政黨·爲解決居住以上各地之七百萬波人問題，刻正開始准行</p>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　據重慶方面消息：重慶政府對新波蘭統一臨時政府，亦已予以承認。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫　接見丹使</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據塔斯社莫十斯科訊：七月六日蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫接見丹麥駐蘇公使杜辛，討論有關公使向蘇呈　國書事宜。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾首相　赴南法度假</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據倫敦廣播，路透社政治記者頃宣稱：邱吉爾首相即將前往法國南部小休，至柏林舉行三頭會議時方能賦歸。休養地點則未有說明，假期中將由艾登外相主持閣議。</p>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電據倫敎官方於昨日宣稱：英外相艾登之健康即將恢復，同時渠木人亦深望能於下週繼續處理一切要務，並能代表邱吉爾首相出席閣議。</p>
<h3>威爾遜任美財長</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據華盛頓電，白宮當局六日發表：毛根韜辭職後，所遺財長一職，已選由現任戰時動員局長威爾遜繼任，一俟特魯曼參加三頭會議終了歸來時，當即正式發表任命。</p>

<h3>當前上海教育界的病態</h3>
<p>— 管樂</p>
<p>教育是立國之本，他據負着訓練次代國民的重大使命。所以敎育事業能否正常合理的進行，對於國家社會的前途，關係是十分重大的。俗語說得好。「種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆，」現在實施怎麽樣的敎育，將來就產生怎麽樣的國民。社會前途的能否進步，國家前途的能否光明，只要看現在敎育的情形，就可以知道了。</p>
<p>可是，我們對於當前上海教育界的情形，仔細的加以觀察·實堪痛心。現社會商種種腐敗黑暗的情形，無一不反映在教育界裏，使　發生深刻的影響。物價的高壓，生活的浪潮，更冲盪着整個敎育界，使他奄奄一息，毫無生氣，</p>
<p>如果我們還沒有失去理智，還沒有忘掉靑任，那末我們決不能護整個上海的敎育，趨向於失敗沒落之途。如果我們還堅信我們國家的前途，一定會有光明的希望，那末我們更不當坐視上海敎育界沉淪於腐敗黑暗之地而不加挽救。所以現在特地把個人的觀感發表出來，希望能因此而引起社會有心人士的注意，而共同籌劃補救的方法，那是竭誠盼望的。</p>
<p>當前上海敎育界不正常不合理的現象·能發生重大而深遠的影響的，約有以下的四項：</p>
<p>一·是學店而非學校　學校是班裡教育，開發民智的機關。所以，學校應當是一種謀公衆幸福的社會事業，快不是一　圖謀私利的營業商店。可是事實上却並不如此。自戰事發生以後，各級學校竟如雨後春筍一般的設立起來，只要租貨一幢半幢房屋，領到了一張營業執照，就可以公開營業，眞是十步一小學，百步一中學。有許多老闆校長·更視學校如商店，辦教育如經商，有的挪用校款，從事　機事業，有的尅扣敎員薪金，以圖不法贏利，甚至侵佔教員米票，無故更動教員，糾紛壘起，　態百出。因此神聖的學校，便被一般人目爲卑鄙的學店了。其實校長之中，也有不少潔身自好之士，要想論辦理敎育，來盡國民一份子的義務。可是好人也被壞人所果，使他們開補得口。所以當前上海的敎育界，能一本正經辦理敎育的固然有，可是以圖謀不法贏利作爲生產機關的大小學店，却也着實不在少數。這是上海敎育界的第一種病態。</p>
<p>二，是敎授而非敎育敎投只是注意智識的傳授，敎育却應着重道德的訓練。一般的學校，一般的敎師，大都只注意於智識的傳授，而忽略了道德的訓練。他們以爲只要識得敎科書上的字，能寫能算，就可以常一個敎員了。有些學校也以注重實學位號召，在小學三年級時，就敎起文言文和外國語來，以投合一般社會人士的心理。至於比智識傳授更重要的事情，如健康的活動，品性的陶冶，人格的鍛鍊等等，却都付之闕如。有的學校更加多上課時間，增添課外工作，而把精神訓練和技能訓練的科目，任意減削。因爲這種塡鴨式的敎法，和過於鞏重的功課，把活潑天眞的兒童，竟敎成呆笨瘦弱的書　子了。這還是辦理認眞的好學校，至於精神　懈的學店，只是聘任些廉價的不合格的敎員，運敎授二字，都不能勝任。因此上海的各級學校，上等的是使學生成爲死讀書的兩脚書橱，下等的更使兒童變成粗野無禮的浮沿少年。以未來建國的重任，付之於這樣許多的兒童和靑年，其危險情形，眞是不堪設想。這是上海敎育界的第二種病態。</p>
<p>三，是職業而非事業　大家都知道教育是一種神聖的事業，是一種高尚的工作。所以担負敎育之責的人，對於這一點，都言先應該有淸楚的認識。辦學校的人，固然不能見利忘義放棄他應負的責任。枵腹從公，固是常人所難，坐視一家老劫，　　不繼，啼飢號寒，也難以安心工作。所以社會為心人士，應得起來設法解除敎師生活上的困難，而給以精神上的慰安。可是做教師的人，也應有刻苦耐勞的習慣，身爲國的精神。因爲他應該知道，自己担，任教育的對象，是未來股價的棟樑，自己擔任的工作，是未來建國的基礎，是絲毫不能疏忽，不能苟且的。有許多無知的敎師，他不明由教育是一種服務的工作，他只常做一種普通的職業看待，只是一天到晚的嗟嘆他的收人微薄，絕無「外快」·也不能像囤貨商人那樣的獲得非法暴利。因此放棄責任，敷衍了事。以這樣腐化的敎師，又怎能敎出優秀的國民呢？這是上海敎育界的第三種病態。</p>
<p>四，是爲社會同化而非改造社會敎育是一種建設的工作，牠負有改造社會使命。人以能推陳楚新·編延不覺·這都是靠教育的攻效啊！可是當前上海教育界·則不獨不能負起這種　大的使命，反而處處提防，反映社會上的黑暗和腐敗，受惡劣社會所同化了。比如般人士只知道囤積欺詐，爭權奪利，因此而校長也專心經商，教育也抽空跑市場，學生也知道囤貨了。以此而言改造社會，又怎麼能有希望呢？學校裏而絕少一種進步的光明的氣象，弄得校長如老　，家長如顧客，教員如　計，尊師重道的精神，旣一絲一毫都沒有·移風易俗的使命，也根本負擔不起。這是上海教育界的第四種病態。</p>
<p>當前上洵敎育界旣有以上的四種病態，那未又怎能希望實施正常合理的教育呢。如果一個人以不法的舉動血殘害或損傷一個小孩的身體時，他的父母或社會輿論，一定會出來干涉，表示抗議。現在這一種不正常不合理的教育，正在殘害千千萬萬天真兒童和優秀靑年的心的摧殘，難道我們還回坐視不管嗎？請大家起來正視上海教育界的病態，積極設法改進，這是國家社會前途之福，也是我們應負的責任啊！</p>
<h3>英美蘇三巨頭　會議期迫近　三國關係重加檢討</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據倫敦電，倫敦消息靈通界傅稱：三巨頭會議日期，至早須延至十日以後，同時美總統時魯曼會一再聲明，在渠本人與邱吉爾首相未作會議之前，三頭會議決不舉行。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　歐戰結束以後，英，美兩國輿論期待之三頭會談，即將舉行，關於會談之地點與日期雖未正式發表，然據傅業已預訂於本周至下週間，在柏林近郊波資坦舉行。自前次克里米亞會談以來，英·美·蘇三國關係又發生新轉變，此即爲納粹德國之崩潰與羅斯福之逝世。克里米亞會談係事前考慮歐戰結束後之歐洲政治問題，然觀於現實局面，克里米亞會談之決定，並未全部被按步實行，同時羅期福邱吉爾史太林三者間，或能基於個人諒解處理問題，暫可防止三國關係分裂。然羅斯福逝世後，由新人特魯曼登台，英美蘇三國開係實有從新角度加以再檢討之必要。</p>
<p>管理德國手段不同</p>
<p>三頭會談之最大問題，厥爲管理德國，如外電迭傅在蘇聯之佔領地域，與英美兩國軍之佔領地域，管理方式完全相反。按蘇聯對佔領地域之德國民，出以寬大態度，儘可能內酊給食糧，許可恢復工會，獎勵共黨社民黨等之再度展開活動，完全遂行獨自政策。反之，英美兩國不容一切政治組織活動，食糧之配給亦僅免於俄死而已，實施荷烈管理政策。英美兩國對蘇聯雖經一再提出抗議，但蘇聯將英美之抗議置若岡聞，任意推進獨自政策。故無論如何，英美蘇美國對德管理難期統一，德國人心現俱傾向於蘇聯，結果德國全部將爲蘇聯操縱。因此，舉行三國會談商討統一管理德斷問題，實爲迫切之要求云。査調整東亞問題及歐洲問題，其原因除波蘭紛爭外，尚有叙利亞紛爭之處理，及韃　尼爾海峽管理問題等多件，此兩問題或於此次會談中討論及之。</p>
<p>東亞政策調整困難　　惟東亞英美蘇三國政策之統一調斃似極困難，蓋美國最近不顧中共政權，採取支援重慶政權之政策，蘇聯則稱蔣政權爲法西斯，竭力支持中共政權。故美蘇大陸政策完全對立，倘放任此種事態，誠有紐約論壇報所云，甚至有引起內亂，致使瀕於危險之可能性。若國共兩政權正面入於武力衝突，則美國對日戰略即根本發生動搖，宋子文此次訪間莫斯科，亦與以上車態有所關聯，此固不待言者，故美國在東亞對蘇政策，認爲有其統一之必要。由是觀之，牽制蘇聯將來於東亞之地位，爲美國最重大之問題，據英國經濟雜誌載稱，克里米亞會談所決定之議案中，並不變更實行方針，例爲三國首腦會談僅不過爲片面之會談而已。總之，英美蘇三國之政策，決無統一之可能性，尤以相互問利害衝突，雖口頭上稱三國政策統一，而實際政策之實施上，仍處對立地位，此點亦極其顯然之現象。</p>

<h3>適應市民需要　寬放用水限量寬　放率為百分之三十</h3>

<h3>Japan Establishes Wartime Technical Guidance Groups in Each Military District; Governor-General Abe Encourages Korean Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - The Japan Institute of Technology has decided to mobilize wartime technical instructors and wartime technical personnel to establish wartime technical guidance groups in each military district nationwide. This is to provide guidance and active support to local factories when they need consultation during construction, defense, evacuation, and other aspects of important factories. Regarding this technical guidance and plan formulation, etc., the deadline is set for the end of October, aiming to complete the fortification plan of the mainland for production in a very short time.</p>
<p>Seoul, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Governor-General Abe, in order to promote the defensive strength of the peninsula against the war situation, issued a statement on the 7th at the inauguration of the headquarters of the Korean National Volunteer Corps. He emphasized the determination to complete the war, stressed the need to seize the divine opportunity of the decisive battle, and to exert patriotic enthusiasm, establish the final decisive battle system to overcome this national crisis. He expects all members to unite as one.</p>
<h3>Minister of Education Praises Students Who Fought in Okinawa</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>During the Battle of Okinawa, local elementary school children also threw grenades, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers. Middle school and high school students, under the direct command of the Japanese army, formed the Iron and Blood Loyal Service Corps, engaging in communication, liaison, transmission of orders, and fortification. Girls also did not lag behind, nursing the wounded and continuing to be active. After receiving a report from the local military, Minister of Education Ota was deeply moved by their loyalty and considered them role models for students. He awarded certificates of commendation to the Iron and Blood Dynamic Island Corps led by Principal Sadao Noda, the Normal School Corps, and the Iron and Blood Dynamic Imperial Corps and Prefectural No. 1 Middle School led by Principal Norio Fujita.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Business Association Reassigned to the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Nanjing, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - The Executive Yuan's Cooperative Business Committee, since receiving the Yuan's order to be reassigned to the Ministry of Industry, formally completed the handover yesterday. The new Director, Zhao-min Huang, personally received the handover, and the personnel of all groups and sections have also been decided. It is also heard that after the association's reassignment, the internal structure has been slightly adjusted. It will have one Director, one Deputy Director, and one Chief Secretary. Under them, there will be two groups: General Affairs and Business. Each group will have three sections, continuing to carry out the work of the previous General Affairs and Business departments. It is noted that Mr. Huang was previously the Secretary-General of the Agricultural Production Increase Committee, and in the future, he is expected to make further contributions to the increased production work of cooperative societies.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Seeks to Expand Influence into the Mediterranean Underground</h3>
<p>Stockholm (京城), July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a New York Times report from London: Soviet authorities issued a statement this week, stating that the Soviet Union should occupy a seat in the conference discussing the Tangier issue. Regarding the Soviet Union's ambition, which it has harbored for a long time, this historical ambition constantly stimulates the Soviet people, guiding them to "strive for influence in the Mediterranean." History indicates to the Soviet people that "Britain is indeed obstructing their path to progress." Now that British power is weakening, the Soviet Union can take the opportunity to rise and realize their ancient aspirations, giving the Mediterranean region a new look. In particular, in recent weeks, the world has observed the Soviet Union's movements regarding the Dardanelles Strait and Tangier. At the same time, the Soviet Union has been conducting restrictive secret activities in the Balkans, Trieste, Livorno, Italy, France, and Spain. Currently, Tangier is like a tempting picture in the eyes of the Soviet Union. In short, for economic, political, and strategic interests, the Soviet Union has no choice but to pay special attention to the status of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The Southwestern General Counteroffensive and the Complex Relationship Between the United States, Chongqing, and Yan'an</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Amidst the calls for a general counteroffensive in the Southwest, the reasons why the American military did not land in South China to echo Chongqing's internal Southwestern counteroffensive are extremely complex. However, roughly speaking, they do not go beyond the following reasons, which are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Not Landing in South China</p>
<p>The United States is anxious to land on the Japanese mainland; Chongqing's plan for a general counteroffensive in the Southwest has not reached a level of sufficient preparation for them to respond to; The Japanese army's mobilization system for defensive operations on the shoreline is too strong; Based on the experience of the Xiang-Gui battles, it is pointed out that no matter how excellent the ground equipment is, air power alone cannot overwhelm the Japanese army's advantage; The geographical conditions of South China. If the American military does not land in South China, then the Chongqing army will definitely not be able to launch a general counteroffensive in the Southwest, which is extremely clear to us. From the Hunan operation to the Gui-Liu operation, the Chongqing field army suffered significant blows, and the loss of the huge arsenal in Guilin was the main reason for weakening Chongqing's rear-line war effort. The reason why the Chongqing army is actively launching a general counteroffensive is nothing more than the fact that the Stilwell Road has been reopened and a considerable amount of air force and military supplies have been prepared in the Chinese mainland. The Japanese army has already understood this situation. The slogans of Chongqing responding to the general counteroffensive in the Southwest are merely empty rhetoric to fulfill their responsibilities to the American military. However, the Chongqing army and the American military's plans for operations against Japan continue to be upheld, and a large number of American ground troops have entered the Chinese mainland, established a Chongqing-America liaison officer system, and encouraged students and educated youth to join the army, striving to promote various policies.</p>
<p>American-Style Education for Officers</p>
<p>According to a broadcast from Chongqing on June 6th, the American military's Fourth Hundred and Seventy-Fifth Infantry Division and One Hundred and Twentieth Cavalry Division, known as the First Mobile Unit, arrived in the Chinese war zone via air from Burma in May, as announced by the U.S. military command in the region. During the previous Chongyang operation, the Japanese army engaged with mechanized units commanded by American officers. Furthermore, after entering Guangxi once again, there was also intelligence that a considerable number of American ground troops were active. However, in ground operations, not a single body of a large army was found, so it is perfectly clear that in mainland operations, they have always made Chongqing the sacrificial vanguard to complete their war plan. Macworth has said that in order to complete the war mission, China's huge manpower should be utilized, and through education and training, it should be transformed into a large number of armed forces, which requires great effort. Therefore, General Amos, along with three hundred American officers, were dispatched to the Southeast China-America Training Group in western Guilin to provide American-style education to the core officers of Chongqing. The training group moved to Guizhou Province before the Guilin operation to continue training. The youth recently called up by Chongqing's student recruitment movement have also entered the training group to receive American-style training. In short, in the past one or two years, American influence has infiltrated China at an extremely high speed. Currently, various undertakings in Chongqing almost cannot be established without the assistance and guidance of American influence. It is estimated that there are about thirty divisions of Americanized Chongqing troops, half of the Burma Expeditionary Force (about ten divisions), about fifteen divisions under the command of the Chinese Army and Air Force Headquarters, and five divisions directly under the Military Commission. In addition, each army division unit is also equipped with dozens of American instructors to make the training reach the functional level of the American military.</p>
<p>Chongqing Adopts a Large Military District System</p>
<p>Regarding the internal camp of the current Chongqing army itself, its war zone was in a state of chaos due to the previous Xiang-Gui operations. For example, Zhang Fakui's Fourth War Zone almost completely lost its war zone capability. Afterwards, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, it began to rebuild the war zone system in order to make a comeback. It is said that Chongqing currently adopts a large military district system, combining the First, Second, Fifth, Eighth, and Tenth War Zones into the Northwest Military District (headquarters in Hanzhong), appointing Li Zongren as the commander-in-chief. The Third, Seventh, and Ninety-Three War Zones are combined into the Southeast Military Management District (headquarters in Qianshan), appointing as the commander-in-chief. The Burma Expeditionary Force, the Hunan-Guangxi border area, and the Shanghai-Vietnam border area are combined to form the Southwest Military District (headquarters in Kunming), with He Yingqin as the commander-in-chief. He Yingqin is currently also the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army and Air Force, so it is feared that there may be confusion in his assuming this position, but the contents are roughly as above. According to recent reliable intelligence, Jiang Dingwen, the commander of the First War Zone in the past war zone formations, has already been replaced, and his position has been taken over by Deputy Commander Hu Zongnan. In addition, the Lu-Su War Zone, with the Shandong Peninsula as its hinterland, is nominally unconnected to the war zone, and a new Tenth War Zone has been established on the south bank of the Yangtze River from southern Anhui Province to Jiujiang, with Li Pinxian, a subordinate of Li Zongren, as the commander. Therefore, although there are no significant changes, it is said that Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces have been reorganized into new war zones, and the "student army" of about four newly formed divisions in the Chongqing army's total strength is quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng, the Minister of Military and Political Affairs of Chongqing, once bluntly stated that one-third of the Chongqing army, about one hundred divisions, would be reorganized, and the equipment of the remaining troops would be strengthened. This small elite main force organization of Chongqing is gradually becoming more excellent due to the student and intellectual youth's joining the army movement. Therefore, Chongqing has proudly claimed that it will soon realize about thirty divisions of "youth divisions" of mechanized troops. It is noted that Chongqing's intellectual youth joining the army movement began with the 100,000-man military movement in June of last year. Regardless of the motivation for recruitment, the recruitment results are generally good. Recently, these student soldiers have been sent to the front line and are facing the sharp edge of the Japanese army. These students all have excellent equipment and a sincere patriotic enthusiasm, so their morale and combat order are unprecedented. In order to train and educate these students, the Chongqing authorities established ten instructor groups and appointed Chiang Kai-shek as the group leader and Luo Zhuoying as the training director. Jiang Jingguo is the organization director. In addition, many American military instructors were hired. In order to encourage these young people, the Chongqing authorities made various slogans, such as "Put down your books and pick up your knives and guns," "The battlefield is like a classroom," and "What is the use of knowledge without a country?" There have been endless instances of these young people wearing military uniforms before enlisting and doing whatever they want without obeying discipline, leaving the responsible authorities with almost no appropriate way to deal with it.</p>
<p>Conflict Between Chongqing and Yan'an</p>
<p>Next, regarding the conflict between Chongqing and Yan'an and the American Air Force in Chongqing, the recent characteristics of the mainland war zone are the armed conflicts between the Chongqing and Yan'an armies in various places and the American Air Force in Chongqing destroying Japanese transportation routes. It is noted that almost all places in China are dominated by various political and armed groups. When Yan'an expanded its political influence this time, these groups rose up together and engaged in head-on conflicts with the Chongqing army everywhere. Therefore, the Yan'an army is extremely to avoid direct conflict with the Japanese army. This is Yan'an's consistent policy of expanding its territory since moving to northern Shaanxi in the 28th year of the Republic. Therefore, the Yan'an side actively launched activities, first ordering the commando work units to go south, establish contact with the indigenous Yan'an army, and implement its new program of encirclement. As a result, the Chongqing side was in a panic. Recently, it has been engaging in daily battles with these Yan'an troops in various places. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to prevent the commando work units under He Ying's command from going south to Hunan, has instructed Wang Lujing, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth War Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the Thirtieth Group Army, to "temporarily cease resisting the Japanese army in order to stop the Yan'an army from going south." The Chongqing regime's fear of Yan'an's expanding influence is greater than we can imagine. The Three People's Principles Youth League branches in various places of the war of resistance have thoroughly implemented the education of suppressing the Communist Party, and after the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing was transferred from the Twentieth Bombardment Group to the Mariana Islands, the Fourteenth Air Force advocated engaging in air operations, and P57 and P40 and other small aircraft patrolled the Wuhan area and the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways, attempting to destroy transportation lines. Recently, large transport aircraft have been used to transport soldiers and materials by air, which is noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Japan's Eastern Small and Medium-Sized Cities Suffer First Air Raids; Small Fires Occur in the Central Region</h3>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - About 200 B29s from the Mariana Islands base attacked the eastern military district from 11:30 PM on the 6th for four hours, carrying out incendiary bomb attacks on various small and medium-sized cities. The first group of about 80 aircraft invaded Kofu City, the second group of about 60 aircraft invaded Shimizu City, and the third group of about 50 aircraft invaded Chiba City, each carrying out incendiary bomb attacks. The fourth group of about 10 aircraft acted in Mito City. Incendiary bombs caused fires in Kofu, Chiba, and Shimizu Cities, but thanks to the efforts of military officers and civilian air defense forces, almost all were extinguished by dawn on the 7th. It is noted that this is the first time that enemy aircraft have attacked small and medium-sized cities in the eastern military district.</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - About 110 B29 enemy aircraft from the southern base invaded the central military district from 10:30 PM on the 6th.

They fled south after 2:00 AM on the 7th. Although fires broke out in the above-mentioned areas, the losses were not great.</p>
<h3>Polish Government Implements New Policies</h3>
<p>Stockholm (京城), July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a Warsaw report: The new Polish unified government has first decided to take over the assets in England, and a committee has been established in London to be responsible for taking over these assets, which was announced by the Polish News Agency on the 4th. Regarding this point, according to informed sources, the Polish government-in-exile in London insists that it is the only legitimate government of Poland, and therefore such issues have caused a major uproar. On the one hand, the allied countries have recognized the new government, and as a result, the Curzon Line has been ceded to the Soviet Union as a price. However, determining the eastern border of Germany will become a major issue at present. Poland has now sent commissioners to East Prussia, West Pomerania, Silesia, and other places to cooperate with the Soviet army in assuming administrative responsibilities. The Polish Democratic Party of the new government is now beginning to implement a plan to solve the problem of the 7 million Poles living in the above-mentioned areas.</p>
<p>Stockholm (京城), July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to sources in Chongqing: The Chongqing government has also recognized the new Polish unified provisional government.</p>

<p>Weekly Commentary</p>
<h3>The Current Pathologies of Shanghai's Education Scene</h3>
<p>— Guan Le</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a nation, bearing the significant mission of training the next generation of citizens. Therefore, whether education progresses normally and reasonably is of vital importance to the future of the nation and society. As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow." The kind of education implemented now will produce the kind of citizens in the future. Whether society can progress and whether the nation's future can be bright can be known simply by looking at the current state of education.</p>
<p>However, when we carefully observe the current situation in Shanghai's education circles, it is truly heartbreaking. The various corrupt and dark phenomena of present society are all reflected in the education sector, causing it to be deeply affected. High prices and the pressure of life are further impacting the entire education field, leaving it barely alive and devoid of vitality.</p>
<p>If we haven't lost our reason and haven't forgotten our youth, then we must not allow the entirety of Shanghai's education to head towards failure and decline. If we still firmly believe that our nation's future will certainly have bright prospects, then we shouldn't sit idly by and watch Shanghai's education scene sink into a corrupt and dark place without attempting to save it. Therefore, I am now specifically expressing my personal observations, hoping that this will attract the attention of concerned individuals in society, and that they will collectively plan remedial measures. That is my sincere hope.</p>
<p>The abnormal and unreasonable phenomena in Shanghai's current education scene, which can have major and far-reaching impacts, are approximately the following four:</p>
<p>1.  More Like "School-Shops" Than Schools. Schools are institutions for imparting education and developing public intelligence. Therefore, schools should be a type of social undertaking aimed at public happiness, not a business enterprise for seeking private gain. However, in reality, it is not so. Since the outbreak of war, schools at all levels have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. As long as one rents one or two buildings and obtains a business license, they can openly operate. It truly is a primary school every ten steps and a middle school every hundred steps. Many boss-principals even regard schools as shops and running education as doing business. Some misappropriate school funds to engage in speculative ventures, while others deduct teachers' salaries in order to make illegal profits, even encroaching on teachers' rice rations and arbitrarily changing teachers. Disputes pile up, and scandalous behavior abounds. As a result, the sacred school is regarded by the general public as a contemptible "school-shop." In reality, there are also many principals who are self-respecting and want to run education properly to fulfill their duty as a citizen. However, good people are also influenced by bad people, rendering them unable to speak up. Therefore, in Shanghai's current education scene, there are certainly some who run education seriously, but there are also a considerable number of large and small "school-shops" that treat illegal profiteering as a means of production. This is the first pathology of Shanghai's education scene.</p>
<p>2.  More About "Teaching" Than Education. Teaching only focuses on the transmission of knowledge, while education should emphasize moral training. Most schools and most teachers mostly focus on the transmission of knowledge and neglect moral training. They believe that as long as one knows the words in textbooks and can write and calculate, they can be a teacher. Some schools also appeal to the emphasis on practical learning, teaching classical Chinese and foreign languages as early as the third grade of elementary school in order to cater to the psychology of the general public. As for things more important than the transmission of knowledge, such as healthy activities, character cultivation, and personality development, they are all ignored. Some schools even increase class time and add extracurricular work, while arbitrarily reducing subjects of mental training and skill training. Because of this cramming method of teaching and excessively heavy homework, lively and innocent children are taught to become dull and weak bookworms. These are still the good schools that run things seriously. As for the spiritually lax "school-shops," they simply hire some cheap and unqualified teachers, and even the two words "teaching" are beyond their capabilities. Therefore, Shanghai's schools at all levels, the upper tier turns students into bookworms who read books to death, and the lower tier turns children into crude and impolite floating youths. Entrusting the important task of building the nation in the future to so many children and young people, the dangerous situation is truly unimaginable. This is the second pathology of Shanghai's education scene.</p>
<p>3.  More a Job Than a Calling. Everyone knows that education is a sacred calling, a noble work. Therefore, those who bear the responsibility of education should first have a clear understanding of this. Those who run schools certainly cannot forsake their responsibilities for the sake of profit. It is difficult for ordinary people to work selflessly for the public good, and it is also difficult to work with peace of mind when one sees their family hungry and cold. Therefore, concerned individuals in society should rise up and find ways to alleviate the difficulties in teachers' lives and give them spiritual comfort. However, teachers should also have a habit of hard work and endurance, and be the spiritual backbone of the nation. Because they should know that the objects of their education are the pillars of the future nation, and the work they undertake is the foundation for future nation-building, which cannot be neglected or perfunctorily dealt with in the slightest. Many ignorant teachers do not understand that education is a service work, and they only treat it as an ordinary job, lamenting all day long that their income is meager, that there is no "extra income," and that they cannot obtain illegal profits like merchants who hoard goods. Therefore, they abandon their responsibilities and act perfunctorily. How can such corrupt teachers teach outstanding citizens? This is the third pathology of Shanghai's education scene.</p>
<p>4.  More Assimilation By Society Than Transformation of Society. Education is a constructive work that carries the mission of transforming society. People are able to discard the old and bring forth the new, evolving endlessly, all thanks to the effectiveness of education! However, the current Shanghai education scene not only fails to take on this important mission, but instead is constantly on guard, reflecting the darkness and corruption of society, and is assimilated by the bad society. For example, ordinary people only know how to hoard and defraud, and to fight for power and profit. As a result, principals also focus on doing business, education is also emptied out to run the market, and students also know how to hoard goods. With this kind of mindset, how can there be hope of transforming society? Schools rarely have a progressive and bright atmosphere, turning principals into old bureaucrats, parents into customers, and teachers into accountants. The spirit of respecting teachers and valuing the Tao is completely absent, and the mission of changing customs and habits is simply impossible to bear. This is the fourth pathology of Shanghai's education scene.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai's current education scene has the above four pathologies, how can we hope to implement normal and reasonable education? If a person harms or injures the body of a child through illegal actions, their parents or public opinion will certainly come out to interfere and protest. Now, this abnormal and unreasonable education is harming the hearts of millions of innocent children and outstanding young people. Are we still going to sit idly by and do nothing? Please rise up and face the pathologies of Shanghai's education scene squarely, and actively find ways to improve it. This is a blessing for the future of the nation and society, and it is also our responsibility!</p>
<h3>The Three Great Powers of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<h3>The Conference Date is Approaching</h3>
<h3>A Re-examination of the Relations Between the Three Countries</h3>
<p>Lisbon, July 7th, Central News Agency: According to London reports, well-informed sources in London claim that the date of the three-power conference will have to be delayed until after the 10th at the earliest. At the same time, U.S. President Truman has repeatedly stated that the three-power conference will not be held until he and Prime Minister Churchill have met.</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 7th, Central News Agency: Since the end of the European War, the three-power talks expected by public opinion in Britain and the United States are about to be held. Although the location and date of the talks have not been officially announced, it is reported that they have been scheduled to be held in Potsdam, near Berlin, between this week and next week. Since the previous Crimean Conference, new changes have taken place in the relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, namely the collapse of Nazi Germany and the death of Roosevelt. The Crimean Conference was to consider the political issues in Europe after the end of the European War in advance. However, looking at the current situation, the decisions of the Crimean Conference have not been fully implemented step by step. At the same time, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin were able to handle problems based on personal understanding, which could temporarily prevent the division of relations between the three countries. However, after Roosevelt's death, with the new President Truman taking office, it is necessary to re-examine the relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union from a new perspective.</p>
<p>Different Means of Managing Germany</p>
<p>The biggest issue of the three-power talks is the management of Germany. As foreign dispatches have repeatedly reported, the management methods in the Soviet-occupied areas are completely opposite to those in the British and American military-occupied areas. According to reports, the Soviet Union treats the German people in the occupied areas with leniency, providing as much food as possible, allowing the restoration of trade unions, and encouraging the re-launch of activities by the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, completely pursuing its own policies. On the contrary, Britain and the United States do not allow any political organizations to operate, and the distribution of food is only enough to prevent starvation, implementing a harsh management policy. Although Britain and the United States have repeatedly protested to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has ignored the protests of Britain and the United States and arbitrarily promoted its own policies. Therefore, no matter what, it is difficult to expect the United States to unify its management of Germany, and the German people are now inclined towards the Soviet Union, and as a result, the entire Germany will be manipulated by the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is an urgent requirement to hold tripartite talks to discuss the issue of unified management of Germany. It is said that the reasons for adjusting the issues in East Asia and Europe, in addition to the Polish dispute, also include the handling of the Syrian dispute and the management of the Dardanelles Strait, and these two issues may be discussed at this meeting.</p>
<p>Difficult to Adjust East Asian Policies</p>
<p>However, it seems extremely difficult to unify the policies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in East Asia. Recently, the United States has disregarded the Chinese Communist regime and adopted a policy of supporting the Chongqing regime, while the Soviet Union has called the Chiang regime fascist and has vigorously supported the Chinese Communist regime. Therefore, the mainland policies of the United States and the Soviet Union are completely opposed. If this situation is allowed to continue, as the New York Tribune said, it may even cause internal strife, leading to a dangerous situation. If the Kuomintang and Communist regimes enter into armed conflict head-on, the United States' strategy towards Japan will fundamentally be shaken. Song Ziwen's visit to Moscow this time is also related to the above situation, which goes without saying. Therefore, the United States believes that it is necessary to unify its policies towards the Soviet Union in East Asia. From this perspective, containing the Soviet Union's future position in East Asia is the most important issue for the United States. According to the British magazine The Economist, the resolutions decided at the Crimean Conference will not be changed, for example, the three-nation summit is only a one-sided meeting. In short, there is no possibility of unifying the policies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, especially with conflicting interests. Although they claim to unify the three-nation policies in words, they are still in an opposing position in the implementation of actual policies, which is also a very obvious phenomenon.</p>

<h3>Meeting the Needs of Citizens</h3>
<h3>Water Usage Limit Expanded</h3>
<h3>Expansion Rate is Thirty Percent</h3>
<p>With the summer heat approaching, citizen water usage is bound to surge. To meet the daily life needs of Shanghai's citizens, and with the consideration of sanitation and health during the summer, the relevant authorities have made a specific decision to expand the current water usage limit starting July 1st until the end of September. The rate of expansion is 30 percent. In other words, the water usage limit in February of this year will be reinstated. The authorities overcame great difficulties with a lack of coal and power supply, a desperate need for water by factories, and a shortage of materials for cleaning water sources and resolutely adopted this measure. One can say that this move placed the citizen's needs above all else. Therefore, we hope that citizens cooperate and conserve water to the fullest, to avoid waste. Those who exceed the usage limit or steal water will be cut off from the water supply and severely punished.</p>

<h3>Coal Exchange for Electricity Allocation</h3>
<h3>Must Emphasize Coal Quality</h3>
<p>The coal exchange for electricity allocation system is already in effect. It is understood that in order to assist the development of industries related to people's livelihoods, the authorities have overcome various technical difficulties and changed the electricity allocation regulations, increasing it from 430 degrees per ton to 600 degrees. However, users are hoped to pay special attention to the quality of the coal when delivering it, as poor coal quality greatly hinders power generation and its effectiveness will inevitably be reduced.

<h3>Financial Bureau Investigates</h3>
<h3>Taxes on Beef and Mutton</h3>
<p>The City Finance Bureau has recently adjusted the special tax rate on pork. The special tax on beef and mutton is also being readjusted, and has been revised with reference to market prices. The consumer special tax will be 30,000 yuan for each large cow, 4,000 yuan for each small cow, and 2,000 yuan each for goats and sheep.

<p>The Ministry of Finance's Revenue Department will increase the cigarette unified tax rate from 65 percent to 100 percent *ad valorem* starting this month. The valuation of cigarettes will be deliberated and increased as appropriate depending on future circumstances.</p>
<h3>Economy Bureau Urges Registration of Major Commodities</h3>
<p>The City Economy Bureau recently urged the registration of major commodities, as the originally extended deadline of one month is about to expire. Except for the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, which has sent a list of major commodities prepared by various trade associations, and most trade association representatives and members who have come to the bureau to purchase various registration forms and register according to regulations, the remaining merchants who have not registered have been ordered by the bureau to urge their members to register within the deadline as soon as possible. If they exceed the deadline again, they will be severely punished once discovered. The various trade associations that have not yet submitted the lists of their members have also been ordered to submit them by a specific date for verification.</p>
<h3>Stores Punished for Not Issuing Invoices</h3>
<p>The City Finance Bureau formulated rules for the use of invoices by merchants acting as agents for the collection of consumer special taxes, which went into effect on April 15 of this year. All stores should purchase and use them in accordance with the rules. An investigation has found that while many stores are complying with the purchase and use of invoices, there are also quite a few who have not complied. In recent months, more than 640 stores have been found and punished by the Finance Bureau. Among them, the Dalae Socks Factory at 505 Nanjing Road, the Guangming Watch Shop at 172 North Henan Road, Fuxin at 62 North Shanxi Road, Jingcheng at 436 North Henan Road, and Dayoucheng at 10 North Shanxi Road were punished with considerable fines for either not purchasing the invoices at all or not using them after purchasing them.</p>
<h3>Using the Pretext of Bailing Out Vagrants to Extort Money Rampantly</h3>
<p>Criminal Chen Jianqing Apprehended</p>
<p>The municipal vagrant labor camp is for educating vagrants and beggars, reforming hooligans and ruffians, and forcing them to labor, thereby increasing production and assisting in public security. The Municipal Police Bureau assists in detaining and sending vagrants to the camp. To strengthen the detention work, the first, second, third, and fourth detachments of the police bureau have each dispatched personnel to reside in the camp to handle the detention and dispatch of vagrants. Recently, the camp discovered that a criminal, Chen Jianqing, used the pretext of bailing out vagrants to extort large sums of money from ignorant women. The case arose when Zhao Jinbao, the husband of Zhao Zhou, was sent to the camp for confinement by the Xihongkou branch bureau on the morning of the 30th of last month. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, Zhao Zhou brought a letter of guarantee to the camp, wanting to bail out her husband. However, it was found that Zhao Jinbao was arrested on suspicion of theft and was not a good person, so permission was not granted. At that time, Zhao Zhou said that she would ask a man named Chen Jianqing to find a way and that he had demanded 400,000 yuan in "expenses", of which 280,000 yuan had already been paid. She questioned why her husband had not been released. The camp, believing that this matter concerned the reputation of the police bureau, dispatched personnel to investigate and found the facts to be true. The criminal Chen was arrested and interrogated. According to his confession, he did not extort money from Zhao Zhou, but the rewards and travel expenses were given to him by her, totaling 280,000 yuan. He still tried to deny and evade the truth, but the facts of the case are clear. He has been transferred to the investigation section of the third detachment for further investigation in order to be handed over to the District Procuratorate for legal action. The camp authorities also stated that the vagrants are strictly investigated to ensure that they are indeed vagrants or hooligans. Those who are mistakenly detained and have legitimate occupations may apply for bail, but absolutely no fees will be accepted. If any of the above extortion occurs, it may be reported to the camp or the police bureau for legal action.</p>
