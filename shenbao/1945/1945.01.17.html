<h3>布羅德河北激戰　日軍作熾烈邀擊　仁牙因灣敵艦船舟艇沉毀</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電日大本營十五日下午四時三十分發表，仁牙因灣方面之戰况如次：（一）敵軍自海岸附近，逐漸接近班加新安平地兩側山地日軍陣地中。（二）其他一部敵軍，自一月十一日向聖法比安北方達莫爾迭斯附近登陸，日軍陸地部隊在邀擊中。十一·十二兩日，於該地附近予以之損失如次：擊沉擊毀登陸用舟艇十四艘以上，殺傷人員的一千名。（三）日軍航空隊繼續攻擊敵船中，一月十二日之攻擊戰果，已確認者如次：運轍船擊沉者七艘，重傷起火者四艘，驅逐艦擊毀者一艘。日方損失，特別攻擊飛行隊數架，其他二架未　還。（四）日潛水艦一月十二日於呂宋島西方海面，擊沉戰艦一艘。</p>
<p>菲律賓前棧十六日中央社電　敵軍除由仁牙因進攻阿基拉爾外，更由達莫爾迭斯及聖法比安登陸，正面攻擊班加新安平原，布羅德河一帶，擬由北部及西南部兩側侵攻班加新安平原，尤以敵對布羅德河之主力戰，更漸次顯著。敵軍似將布羅德河渡河之主力攻擊目標，置於東岸的十公里之要塞瑪納奧，對布羅德河北部及西北部日軍陣地加以攻擊，然由於日軍熾烈之邀擊，殆被擊退，敵軍僅乘日軍陣地之間隙前進而已。敵軍對布羅德河北面日軍之强力陣地，已呈恐懼之勢，驅使現地人民担當警戒自身陣地及擾亂日軍後方等地，然日軍主力依然堅强，阻止敵軍前進，一舉將其擊潰，刻正待機中。十三夜猛烈砲擊達莫爾迭斯附近敵物資堆積所，使之爆炸終夜。</p>
<p>日軍　中佐談仁牙因南戰況</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍某基地十五日中央社電　仁牙因南岸一帶之攻防戰已熾烈之至，頃視察第一綫歸還某基地之日軍某中佐談述，敵軍登陸後二日間，仁牙因戰塲之狀况如次；本人十日下午抵仁牙因東方某髙地時，灣內已見有三百艘內外敵登陸用舟艇進人，加算灣外之敵舟艇，總數約在六百艘以上，該舟艇羣十分之九均爲搭載兵員者，此外則爲搭載戰車及登陸用器具者，絡繹不絕，進入灣內。日方靜默不動，待機而動，待至下午五時三十分，一齊向敵艦艇攻擊，是時有敵船一艘沉沒，霎時間，戰塲之上空全爲硝烟籠單，敵大型艦船爲烈火包圍者，不知有若干艘，嗣後日軍之砲火益爲熾烈。迄下午六時，敵艦船見勢不利，欲向灣口逃退，日軍當奠中砲火猛攻，敵軍亦對日軍陣地加以猛烈之艦砲射擊與轟炸，仁牙因潛頭化作血光參淡，陰風凄厲之決戰塲，雙方砲戰繼續至翌日拂曉，此間敵登陸部隊，已出沒於以聖法比安爲中心幅廣約五公里之圈內，與在東方髙地設防之日軍第一綫展開熾烈之野戰。十一日敵軍仍拚死，使後續部隊登陸，以大型驅逐艦或巡洋艦二艘，大型運輸船十艘，五千噸以下之小型運輸船十五艘，登陸用舟艇數十艘，侵入達莫爾迭斯與聖法比安中間之海面，而敵機之來襲亦爲執抝。日軍前綫兵士戰意愈益激昂，振奮起全隊特攻隊之精神，對敵軍後續部隊加以猛烈反攻，予敵以重大損失。</p>
<p>麥克沃塞承認遭遇堅堅抵抗</p>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　呂宋島登陸之麥克沃塞軍，目下一心在謀其今後根據地之橋頭堡，據菲律賓前綫美軍某地消息，美第六軍刻正欲將仁牙因灣岸橋頭堡向東南西三方面擴大，是故不與日軍之有力部隊接近。一二日來日軍之抵抗漸次增大，麥克沃塞司令部十四日曾發表謂：仁牙因灣岸橋頭堡附近，到處皆有日軍激烈抵抗，尤其右翼美軍更遭受强力之抵抗。</p>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　日軍航空部隊猛攻侵人菲律賓之美軍，據菲律賓前綫訊，麥克沃塞司令部十四日發表稱，日航空部隊十三日於仁牙因灣之呂宋島西方海面攻擊，美軍船舶受有損失。</p>
<h3>日以桐花章　贈陳代主席　昨在國府法行贈與式</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　日天皇陛下以我國府陳代主席於推進中日親善，貢獻巨大，特贈送陳代主席旭日桐花大綬章，該大綬章於十六日上午十時於國民政府大客堂舉行贈與式，由日本駐華谷大使率同上田中將。今井少將。岸參事官。太田參事官。淸水書記官送達國府，贈與陳代主席，國府方面，參加贈與典禮者，有文官長周隆庠　參軍長　蟒（典禮局長祝晴川代）曁外交部方面褚部長·吳次長·陳司長·徐司長等。</p>
<h3>日溪附近敵艦船　轟沉擊毀十一船　畹町攻防戰中日軍獲捷</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十六日下午三時發表：（一）去年末日軍部隊自日溪附近向加拉頓河左岸撤退，馬猶半島之敵軍，遂逐漸向日溪附近侵入，其後即企圖自海上增强補給。（二）日軍航空部隊對以上之敵運輸船團及登陸地點，自一月九日以來，連日續行攻擊中，至十三日所收戰果中，經確訊者如次：運輸船轟沉二艘，擊沉一艘，擊毀起炸者六艘，巡洋艦擊沉二艘，登陸地點七處起火，一處爆炸，日方損害，自炸未歸還飛機七架。</p>
<p>緬甸前綫十六日中央社電　日軍於中緬國境要衝畹町，反擊企岡沿滇緬公路進入緬甸之渝雲南遠征軍七師，給予極大損失。欲突破國境之渝軍，以五十三軍之一部，於姆塞附近渡過龍川河，甚至企圖攻擊畹町，日軍對此，當即予以猛烈攻擊，終使其潰退。此外，由畹町東方出擊之渝第十集團軍主力，携戰車於戰鬥機掩護下，集中砲火，施行猛攻，故戰車戰最近逐漸激烈。當地日軍對此，以挺身突擊隊潛人渝軍陣地，擾亂其砲兵陣地，更引誘企圖突破日軍之渝軍主力至陣前，然後加以痛擊，渝軍損失極大，終被擊退。元且日至十二日止，日方收容渝軍屍體達七百六十四具，故自各方面觀，畹町攻防戰中，雲南遠征軍之死傷，至少似亦在二萬三千名以上，因屢次之失敗，雲南遠征軍之士氣並益趨降低。</p>
<h3>日大達內相　參拜神宮</h3>
<p>基督徒憤激</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大達內相，十五日正式參拜伊勢神宮，向大神謝拜，幷祈禱擊滅英美</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　敵B29型機轟炸日本伊勢神社，使日本國民憤慨之至，即全日本基督敎徒，對於美軍此種暴戾行爲，亦極憤激，頃者，日本基督敎團總理人富田滿氏，對此談述如次；敵機之轟炸伊勢神宮，可斷定美人無宗敎心理，而對神靈重大之褻凟，日本之基督敎徒，固對美人所抱之宗敎心失去信賴，想全世界之與論亦必如是。敵不僅曾破壞德義各地之宗敎建築，更曾將於馬尼刺之同樣建築作爲轟炸目標，正如於此次對伊勢神宮投彈，此種暴舉，日本國民已沸騰起異常之憤怒，由此，全日本之基督敎徒知美人之宗敎心僅爲形式而已。敵美過去在中國及南方各地城派遣多數宣敎師徒，布道基督敎，乃係推進其政治，而利用宗敎，及至一且戰事發生，則脫去假面具，而不惜褻凟神靈，美國如此暴行，已失去今後在世界宣敎之資格，此種褻凟神靈，而爲人類公敵之美國，遲早必爲懲罪之刑所毀滅。</p>
<h3>渝燃煤缺乏</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　據德國新聞社訊，合衆社重慶消息稱：在納爾遜策劃下新近成立之渝方戰時生產局，現已遭遇嚴重困難，因無法取得充足之燃煤，以供運用機器生產。該局之人員宣稱，須天氣轉暖，始能解除燃煤之缺乏云。</p>
<h3>美籍日僑　均願返國</h3>
<p>馬德里十六日中央社電　德國社訊：美司法部長稱：被禁在加利福尼亞省萊克城中之日僑六千人中，有五千願意返歸日本。渠稱，此等日僑大多數住於美國，而爲美國公民，但彼等堅守日本之理想。</p>
<h3>鄂加緊冬防</h3>
<p>漢口十六日中央社電　省府以時値冬防及空防緊急時期，對於本年冬防工作，尤爲重要，特於日昨分飭合縣加緊冬防工作，並分別保護遭難民衆，嗣後各縣警保方面除按照往年成例維護地方治安，並在鄰鄕之間，應予取得緊急之聯絡。</p>
<h3>日本防衛陣堅固　消防設備已完成</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　B29型機每次空襲日本，必蒙極大損失，而日本所受之損失則極輕徵，其原因不外日本防衛陣之堅固，茲舉一例如次：東京警視廳於去年曾特別增設消防隊及警備隊，最近該兩隊實力均極充實，消防隊方面於人員上增强均二倍半，壓水機增加約一倍半，於此必要之消防設備已行完成。此外，並將全東京發別編成爲十三地區，於每一地區司令之下，以四個消防署編成部隊，而防止一切不意之火災發生，警防隊則以本部爲作戰司令部，本部之下，以統轄舊市內三十餘警察署，以中央大隊爲首，以及統率新所區內警察署之東部，西部，北部，南部，西南部各大隊等，均已布成萬全陣勢。同時，更將此六大隊編成中隊組織，僅中央大隊爲三個中隊，其他之大隊則每大隊編成爲二個中隊，中隊下更分成兩小隊，小隊之下分成四分隊。又自隊員方面，視其平均年齡均較下級警士爲低，多係二于四五歲之靑年，或爲自陸海軍第一綫歸還之勇士，故凡有志參加者，或經愼重選拔者，均爲優秀之靑年，是故，以此等精銳警隊開赴塲地消火或救援遭難者，自屬事半功倍也。</p>
<p>日飛營機防衛國土</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日軍戰鬥機於東京上空或海洋上空，邀擊來襲日本本土之B29型機，擊落其誇稱爲不落要塞，收獲輝煌戰果，此種防衛日本國土之新銳機，即爲日本科學界全部硏究結晶之「飛營」機，該飛營機擁有輕快之髙性速度，如十一月三日B29型機空襲東京時，該機敢與其拼撞將其擊落後，而安然歸還之四宮機，亦爲飛營機。</p>
<h3>希愛拉斯團　控制廿一區</h3>

<h3>徵收學費　調整辦法大綱　敎部分咨各省市遵辦</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　上學期各省市爲提高學校敎職員待遇，曾酌量增加學費。敎部因鑒於少數地方尙有徽收學米，或按照米價折收學費情形，値此米價踊騰之今日，適足以促成失學人數之激增，事實殊不合理，亟應嚴予糾正。爰特分咨各省市政府將徵收學米及試行米價收費等辦法一律停止，並由敎部規定各地徵收學費調整辦法大綱，分咨各省市政府通飭遵辦。茲錄調整辦法大網於後：（一）各地公私立各級學校每學期徵收學費標準，由各省市主管敎育行政機關審愼規定，嚴令所轄學校一律遵照。（二）徵收學費槪以國幣爲單位，不得以米或其他物資作標準，所有各地徵收學米及按米折價等辦法一律停止。（三）各地實施義務敎育之簡易小學短期小學，以及培養師資之各類師範學校，一概不得徵收學費。（四）徵收學費應充提髙各校敎職員待遇之用，由主管敎育行政機關妥定分配辦法，務求儘速發放，（五）私立學校收取學費，以不超過同地公立學校規定學費之一倍爲原則，各地主管敎育行政機關査明私立學校有不遵規定濫收鉅額學費情事，應迅予制止。（六）各校徵收學費後，除學生家庭自動捐助外，不得再有勒募捐欵或强迫獻金情事，各地主管敎育行政機關並應注意防止。（七）各校應設置免費學額，以容納家境淸寒之學生，是項免費額應佔學生總數之比率，小學不得少於百分之二十，中等學校不得少於百分之十五，專科以上學校不得少於百分之十，並應逐年遞增。（八）各省市規定各校學費標準，應於每學期開學前一月內咨報本部備核，關於學費分配曁免費學額之設置，並應由主管敎育行政機關分別詳訂辦法，轉報本部備査。（九）各省市主管敎育行政機關，於每學期終應將學費微收與分配，及設置免費學額情形，彙造報吿，呈轟本部以備査考。（十）本辦法大網自分咨各省市政府之日起施行。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>讀羅秘書和就職談話後</h3>
<p>本市新任市政畏官前日分別正式接事，我們對於周市長的吿市民書，已於昨論提出若干感想，今天想進而就羅秘書長於就職時所發表的談話，略陳管見。</p>
<p>羅秘書長指出今後本市施政重點，爲下列三點：</p>
<p>一，理頭苦幹，以身作則</p>
<p>二，整飭風紀，勵行廉潔政治；</p>
<p>三，增加生產，安定民生，並協力大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>上述三點，確爲目前當政者所應該重視，竭力做到。羅秘書長過去任司法行政部長時代，及最近主持安徽省政任內，其公正正清廉的政　，爲衆所共知，尤其破除情面和勇幹精神，更著聲譽。困難的上海市政，已有不怕難，抱定苦幹寶幹硬幹精神，和「治亂世，用重典」的原則的周佛海先生來担任，再以羅秘書長來轉佐，我們相信上海市政，今後必能煥然一新，成爲和平區內的模範政治。但是，正因爲上海環境的惡劣，我們希望周市長羅秘書長對於此點，事前有深刻的觀察，審愼的計劃，然後大刀闊斧的幹去，則上海的市政，有光輝的成績，是可以預卜的。</p>
<p>所謂埋頭苦幹，我們認爲是浮泛慣的許多中國政治工作者所必須悉力以赴的做事態度。埋頭苦幹，應具硬幹實幹快幹的精神。苦幹是要刻苦耐勞，不怕艱辛，祗須對公有好處，個人利害，當置之度外；硬幹要任勞任怨，不怕得罪，不怕結怨，不避任何阻難，應做就做，做得到必須做；實幹是要切切實實幹去，不空洞，不虛僞，實事求是，做到確實有成績而後已；快幹是要迅速決斷果敢，不因循，不拖泥帶水，說做就做，以求最短期內獲得行政效率。如能做到這些，則眞正做事的人可以有了，我們相信事情一定能够做得好。而羅秘書長又所特別提示的以身作則，各長官如都能本此意旨，身體力行，則上行下効，行政可走上軌道，也必沒有問題了</p>
<p>整飭風紀，勵行廉潔政治，乃是我們一向所倡導的事。我們曾經一而再，再而三的大聲疾呼過，要求整飭風紀，建立廉潔政治，營私舞弊，貪汚勒索，是今日政治之瘤，若再不嚴加整肅，前途　將不堪設想。尤其英美帝國主義餘毒未淸，窮奢極惡的上海，風紀需要整飭，廉潔政治需要建立，更比其他地方來得迫切。我們希望周羅諸長官一面盡可能提高在職工作人員的待遇，以保障他們最低限度的生活，一面則對於不盡職而利用職位的營私舞弊，貽害人民的不良份子，則非遝用斷然手段，嚴加處分不可。又是非必須公正，賞罰必須嚴明，唯有在公正嚴明的原則之下，纔能眞正建立廉潔政治。此外，目前感行於特殊階級及暴發戶中的奢侈放蕩生活，也應在嚴加整肅之列。把這些人無謂的消耗移之於正當之用，把少數人特殊的浪費，移給多數人去受用，是最合理沒有的事。電力的分配，即是一例。</p>
<p>關於增加生產，安定民生，這雖然也是老生常談，然而眞正能够努力去做的，終是絕少。這兩事困難固多，但過去在努力上也顯然不够。目前滬市各項生產事業因受電力的限制，原料的困難，及其他種種阻難，衰落已極，一部份且已瀕絕境，若不亟謀挽救，危機實在太深。安定民生的積極方法，即是增加生產，而抑平物價則爲應急措置。年來市民受髙物價的痛苦，眞是難以形容，髙物價甚至可以說是市民們當前一切痛苦之源。物價的高漲，固然是基於物資來源的缺乏，可是投機商人的興波作浪，不肖官員的包庇囤積，縱容居奇，也應負極大的責任。所以在想整飭風紀之際，如何淸除官商敗類朋比爲奸的作惡，應屬主要目樑之一。庶由此可使民生至少不再惡化下去，並得以較多力量，協力於大東亞戰爭。</p>

<p>首都通訊</p>
<h3>戰時建設部的工作</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　閔賢</p>
<p>事變前鐵道交通兩部及都市水利建設等事務，現均歸併建設部，故該部工作，極爲重要。記者乘留京之便，特往該部訪問，適逢傳式說部長出席水利會議，當由該部主任秘畫劉傳亮氏接見。劉氏曾任浙江省第二區行政督察專員兼該區保安司令，治民勦匪，頗著政聲。</p>
<p>中電郵政</p>
<p>記者首詢路電郵航情形，劉氏對目前交通困難情形，有所論列，謂：以鐵路言之，一切紀律實較事變前爲差，本部前曾在可能範圍內，對取締車票黑市，以及疏暢正當運輸，盡最大努力，今後仍當本此方針推進，總期一切不合理情形，日趨减少。關於郵費，現已增加不少，但因物價髙漲，郵務人員仍難維持生活，不過本部對於郵遞遲滯情形，當隨時注意改善。至於內河航輪，前曾發生不幸事件數次，溺斃多命，殊屬痛心，本部對於事前之取締，事後之懲處，決嚴厲執行，總期此種不幸事件，茲後不再發生。惟當此非常時期，路電郵航四政，自當以軍事爲先，因而引起不便利之情形，實屬無法避免。</p>
<p>拓墾工程</p>
<p>對於拓墾東太湖及塡平尹山湖情形，劉氏謂：拓墾東太湖帶湖沼地區，國府曾經發行建設公債，爲工事費用，現已開拓新耕地一萬三千畝，每年可增產米穀四萬八千石，同時更可增產同量之小麥。尹山湖工事，經費五千萬元，所塡面積達一萬畝。以上二處工事，現仍積極推進，將來對於增產方面，自有相當效果。最後談及南京泰淮河疏濬工程，劉氏謂：事變前疏濬計畫，早有擬訂，惜乎未克實現，該河有關首都觀瞻及民衆健康，傅部長極爲重視。將來經費籌有辦法，當會同南京市政府疏濬云云。</p>
<p>新年市聲</p>
<h3>確立上海戰時體制</h3>
<p>— 王陽</p>
<p>我國正式參加大東亞戰爭，到今年一月九日已滿一年，在這一年之中，我們對於戰爭貢獻了多少？恐怕回答這問題的人都要慚愧，不要說對於戰爭的貢獻，就是國內戰爭的空氣也淡薄得很，民間參戰的氣息也淡薄得很。允其是上海，依舊是片歌舞昇平的世界，使人置身其間，會忘却世界上多數國家，現正遭着空前未有的戰爭難。</p>
<p>好久以前，我們已在報上見到德國將戲院一律封閉，日本也停演歌無劇，以適應戰時體制，環顧上海，旅店里依舊竹牌擘拍，酒樓上依舊髙朋滿座，舞塲中依舊笙歌喧騰，我覺得目下上海奢侈淫逸的程度，並不减於從前。上海也是參戰國家的都市，使稍有頭腦的人見了，不但是慚愧，簡直是痛心，更何以對舉國上下克盡千辛萬苦的盟邦？同時當局髙喊「確立戰時體制」，「厲行決戰生活」，但對於上海種種戰時不應該有的現象，爲什麼不積極的糾正。</p>
<p>在歷史上，戰時民間如果依然荒淫奢華，是亡國的預兆。現代戰爭是總力戰爭，人民生活糜爛煥散，直接浪費物資時間和精力，在大東亞戰爭演變到如火如荼的今日，我們不得不大聲疾呼：「確立上海的戰時體制」！</p>
<p>我們希望新任市政當局，深切考慮以下各點，如果認爲應該如此的，則毅然決然實施，不怕任何的阻撓。</p>
<p>（一）封閉一切含有賭博性的機關，將是項塲所改爲公共體育塲，以供市民鍛練體魄。</p>
<p>（二）舞塲十·歌塲·書寓等銷金窟一律勒令停業。</p>
<p>（三）減少劇塲數目，（包括電影·話劇·說書·及地方戲等）而演出均以有意義者爲限，色情·胡鬧·頹廢等之演出一律禁正。</p>
<p>（四）旅店以旅客正當投宿爲限，嚴禁一切不良行爲，如賭博吸毒及徵歌選色等。</p>
<p>（五）酒樓·茶室·咖啡館等不准出售高貴食品，並儘量增加筵席捐，使浪費的顧客減少。</p>
<p>（六）取締奢侈品之製造與銷售，如化裝品，精美之衣料及糖果點心等。</p>
<p>上列諸項逐一做到後，都會淫糜之風，將大爲减少，整個上海市，將充滿新生之朝氣及決戰姿能，足以减除大量消耗及奮發民心，故確立上海的戰時體制，實是刻不容綏的事，亟盼市政當局從速考慮實行！</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle North of the Brod River: Japanese Forces Mount a Vigorous Counterattack, Enemy Warships and Landing Craft Destroyed in Lingayen Gulf</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th - Central News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 15th, regarding the situation in Lingayen Gulf, as follows: (1) Enemy forces are gradually approaching the Japanese positions on both sides of the Bangasinan plain from the vicinity of the coast. (2) Another portion of the enemy forces landed near Damortis, north of San Fabian, on January 11th. Japanese ground forces are engaging them in a counterattack. On the 11th and 12th, the following losses were inflicted on the enemy in the vicinity: Over 14 landing craft sunk or destroyed, and over 1,000 personnel killed or wounded. (3) Japanese air units continue to attack enemy ships. The confirmed results of the attacks on January 12th are as follows: 7 transport ships sunk, 4 heavily damaged and ablaze, and 1 destroyer destroyed. Japanese losses: several Special Attack Flight teams, and 2 other planes not returned. (4) A Japanese submarine sank a battleship in the waters west of Luzon Island on January 12th.</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 16th - Central News Agency: In addition to advancing from Lingayen towards Aguilar, enemy forces have also landed at Damortis and San Fabian, attacking the Bangasinan plain head-on. They are attempting to invade the Bangasinan plain from the north and southwest via the Brod River area, with the main enemy effort gradually focusing on the Brod River. The enemy seems to be targeting the fortress of Manao, 10 kilometers east of the Brod River, for their main crossing assault, attacking Japanese positions north and northwest of the Brod River. However, due to vigorous Japanese counterattacks, they have been largely repulsed, with enemy forces only advancing through gaps in the Japanese lines. The enemy appears intimidated by the strong Japanese positions north of the Brod River, and is using local people to guard their own positions and harass the Japanese rear, etc. However, the main Japanese forces remain strong, preventing the enemy's advance, and are poised to crush them in one fell swoop, awaiting their opportunity. On the 13th night, a fierce artillery barrage struck enemy supply depots near Damortis, causing explosions throughout the night.</p>
<p>Japanese Lieutenant Colonel Discusses the Battle South of Lingayen</p>
<p>Japanese Base in the Philippines, 15th - Central News Agency: The battle south of Lingayen is extremely fierce. A Japanese Lieutenant Colonel who recently returned to a certain base after inspecting the front lines described the situation in the Lingayen battlefield in the two days following the enemy landing, as follows: When I arrived at a certain high ground east of Lingayen on the afternoon of the 10th, I saw approximately 300 enemy landing craft entering the gulf. Adding the enemy ships outside the gulf, the total number was approximately 600 or more. Nine-tenths of these craft were carrying troops, while the rest were carrying tanks and landing equipment, entering the gulf in an endless stream. The Japanese remained silent and waited for the opportune moment to strike. At 5:30 PM, they launched a simultaneous attack on the enemy ships. At that time, one enemy ship sank. In an instant, the air above the battlefield was filled with smoke, and countless large enemy ships were engulfed in flames. Subsequently, the Japanese artillery fire became even more intense. By 6:00 PM, the enemy ships, seeing the unfavorable situation, attempted to retreat towards the mouth of the gulf. The Japanese unleashed a fierce artillery barrage, and the enemy also subjected Japanese positions to heavy naval bombardment and aerial attacks. The Lingayen headland was transformed into a bloody, ghostly, and grim battlefield. The artillery duel continued until dawn the next day.

The enemy aircraft attacks were also relentless. The Japanese front-line soldiers' fighting spirit grew even more intense, invigorating the entire special attack force, launching a fierce counterattack against the enemy reinforcements, and inflicting heavy losses.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 16th - Central News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 16th: (1) At the end of last year, Japanese units retreated from the vicinity of Nikkei to the left bank of the Kaladan River.

<p>Burma Front, 16th - Central News Agency: Japanese forces inflicted heavy losses on the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Army's Seventh Division, which attempted to enter Burma along the Yunnan-Burma Highway at Wanting, a key point on the Sino-Burmese border. The Chongqing army, attempting to break through the border, crossed the Longchuan River near Muse with a portion of the 53rd Army, and even attempted to attack Wanting. The Japanese forces immediately launched a fierce counterattack, ultimately forcing them to retreat. Furthermore, the main force of the Chongqing Tenth Army Group, launching an attack from the east of Wanting, concentrated artillery fire under the cover of fighter planes, launching a fierce assault. Consequently, tank warfare has recently intensified. The local Japanese forces, in response, infiltrated Chongqing army positions with suicide attack squads, disrupting their artillery positions. They also lured the main force of the Chongqing army, attempting to break through the Japanese lines, to the front lines, and then launched a devastating attack, inflicting heavy losses on the Chongqing army, ultimately repelling them. From the 1st to the 12th, the Japanese side recovered 764 corpses of Chongqing soldiers. Therefore, from all perspectives, the casualties of the Yunnan Expeditionary Army in the defense of Wanting are estimated to be at least 23,000 or more. Due to repeated failures, the morale of the Yunnan Expeditionary Army has further declined.</p>
<h3>Minister of Home Affairs Ōta Worships at the Ise Shrine. Christians Outraged</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th - Central News Agency: Minister of Home Affairs Ōta formally worshiped at the Ise Grand Shrine on the 15th, offering thanks to the great deity and praying for the destruction of Britain and America.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th - Central News Agency: The bombing of the Ise Shrine in Japan by enemy B-29 aircraft has aroused extreme resentment among the Japanese people. Even Christians throughout Japan are extremely indignant at this brutal act by the American military. Recently, Mr. Tomita Mitsuru, the Secretary General of the Japan Christian Council, stated as follows: The bombing of the Ise Shrine by enemy aircraft confirms that Americans have no religious sensibility, and it is a serious desecration of the divine. Japanese Christians have lost faith in the religious heart of the Americans, and it is believed that worldwide public opinion will feel the same. The enemy not only destroyed religious buildings in Germany and Italy, but also targeted similar buildings in Manila for bombing. Just as with the bombing of the Ise Shrine this time, this kind of barbarity has ignited extraordinary anger among the Japanese people. From this, all Japanese Christians understand that the American religious heart is only a formality. In the past, the enemy, America, sent many missionaries to China and various places in the South to preach Christianity, promoting their politics and exploiting religion. However, once war broke out, they took off their masks and did not hesitate to desecrate the divine. America, with such barbarity, has lost its qualification to preach in the world in the future. This American, who desecrates the divine and is the enemy of mankind, will sooner or later be destroyed by the punishment of the gods.</p>

<h3>Hubei Intensifies Winter Defense</h3>
<p>Hankou, 16th - Central News Agency: As it is currently the critical period for winter defense and air defense, the provincial government believes that this year's winter defense work is particularly important. Therefore, yesterday, it separately instructed all counties to intensify winter defense work, and to protect distressed civilians separately. Subsequently, the police and security departments of each county, in addition to maintaining local security according to past precedents, should also establish emergency communication between neighboring townships.</p>
<h3>Japan's Defense Fortifications are Solid; Fire Fighting Equipment is Complete</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th - Central News Agency: Every time B-29 aircraft raid Japan, they inevitably suffer great losses, while the losses suffered by Japan are extremely slight. The reason is none other than the solidity of Japan's defense fortifications. Here is an example: The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department specially established a fire brigade and a security brigade last year. Recently, the strength of both teams has been greatly increased. The number of personnel in the fire brigade has been increased by 2.5 times, and the number of water pumps has been increased by about 1.5 times. The necessary fire fighting equipment has been completed. In addition, the entire Tokyo has been divided into 13 districts. Under the commander of each district, a unit is formed by four fire stations to prevent any unexpected fire. The security brigade takes the headquarters as the operational command center. Under the headquarters, more than 30 police stations in the old city are supervised, with the Central Battalion as the head, and the Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern, and Southwestern Battalions, which supervise the police stations in the new districts, have been arranged in a perfect formation. At the same time, these six battalions are organized into company organizations. Only the Central Battalion has three companies, while the other battalions each have two companies. Each company is further divided into two platoons, and each platoon is divided into four squads. Also, in terms of the team members, their average age is lower than that of lower-level police officers. Most of them are young people in their twenties or forties, or brave soldiers who have returned from the front lines of the army and navy. Therefore, those who are willing to participate, or those who have been carefully selected, are all excellent young people. Therefore, sending these elite police teams to the scene to extinguish fires or rescue victims is sure to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>

I still hope that everyone will work hard together. After the speech, the entire Navy Department took a photo as a souvenir.

<h3>Collecting Tuition Fees: Outline of Adjusted Measures; Ministry of Education Notifies Provinces and Cities to Comply</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In the last semester, various provinces and cities moderately increased tuition fees to improve the compensation of school teachers and staff. Considering that a few localities still collected tuition in rice or charged tuition based on rice prices, the Ministry of Education noted that with the soaring rice prices of today, this would only lead to a sharp increase in the number of students dropping out of school, which is highly unreasonable and should be strictly corrected. Therefore, the Ministry specially notified the provincial and municipal governments to stop all methods of collecting tuition in rice and charging fees based on rice prices. The Ministry of Education also formulated an outline of adjusted measures for tuition fees to be collected in various localities, which was distributed to the provincial and municipal governments for compliance. The outline of adjusted measures is as follows: (1) The tuition fee standards for each semester in public and private schools at all levels in various localities shall be carefully stipulated by the educational administrative authorities of each province and city, and all schools under their jurisdiction shall be strictly ordered to comply. (2) All tuition fees shall be collected in national currency as the unit, and rice or other materials shall not be used as the standard. All methods of collecting tuition in rice and charging based on rice prices shall be stopped. (3) Simplified primary schools and short-term primary schools implementing compulsory education, as well as all types of normal schools training teachers, shall not collect tuition fees. (4) The tuition fees collected shall be used to improve the compensation of teachers and staff in each school. The educational administrative authorities shall properly determine the distribution methods to ensure prompt disbursement. (5) The tuition fees charged by private schools should, in principle, not exceed one time the tuition fees stipulated for public schools in the same locality. If the local educational administrative authorities find that private schools are not complying with the regulations and are excessively charging exorbitant tuition fees, they should promptly stop them. (6) After collecting tuition fees, schools should not engage in soliciting donations or compulsory contributions, except for voluntary donations from students' families. Local educational administrative authorities should also pay attention to preventing this. (7) Each school should set up free tuition quotas to accommodate students from poor families. The proportion of these free quotas to the total number of students should be no less than 20% for primary schools, no less than 15% for secondary schools, and no less than 10% for colleges and universities, and should increase year by year. (8) The standards for school tuition fees stipulated by each province and city should be reported to the Ministry for record within one month before the start of each semester. Detailed methods for the distribution of tuition fees and the establishment of free tuition quotas should also be separately formulated by the competent educational administrative authorities and reported to the Ministry for record. (9) At the end of each semester, the educational administrative authorities of each province and city should compile a report on the collection and distribution of tuition fees and the establishment of free tuition quotas, and submit it to the Ministry for review. (10) This outline of measures shall be implemented from the date of its distribution to the provincial and municipal governments.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After Reading Secretary Luo's Inaugural Speech</h3>
<p>The new Mayor of our city and Secretary-General officially took office the day before yesterday. We have already expressed some thoughts on Mayor Zhou's address to the citizens in yesterday's editorial. Today, we would like to further comment on Secretary-General Luo's speech at the time of his inauguration.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo pointed out that the key points of the city's administration in the future are the following three points:</p>
<p>1.  Work diligently and lead by example;</p>
<p>2.  Rectify discipline and practice clean governance;</p>
<p>3.  Increase production, stabilize people's livelihood, and cooperate with the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The above three points are indeed what those in power should pay attention to and strive to achieve. Secretary-General Luo's fairness, integrity, and cleanness during his tenure as Minister of Justice and more recently as the head of Anhui Province are well known. His spirit of breaking through sentimentalism and courage is especially well-reputed. The difficult Shanghai municipal government is now headed by Mr. Zhou Fohai, who is not afraid of difficulties and is determined to work hard and apply the principle of "using severe penalties to govern a chaotic world," with Secretary-General Luo assisting him. We believe that the Shanghai municipal government will definitely be renewed in the future and become a model of governance within the peace zone. However, precisely because of the harsh environment in Shanghai, we hope that Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo will have a deep observation and careful plan for this matter beforehand, and then carry it out decisively. Then, the Shanghai municipal government will achieve brilliant results, which can be predicted.</p>
<p>The so-called burying oneself in hard work, we believe, is a working attitude that many Chinese political workers who are accustomed to superficiality must strive to adopt. Burying oneself in hard work should embody the spirit of tough work, practical work, and quick work. Hard work means being assiduous and enduring hardship, not being afraid of difficulties, and putting personal interests aside as long as it benefits the public; Tough work means being able to bear hardship without complaint, not being afraid of offending people, not being afraid of making enemies, and not avoiding any obstacles. It should be done as soon as it should be done, and it must be done if it can be done; Practical work means doing it in a down-to-earth manner, without being empty or hypocritical, being pragmatic and realistic, and only stopping after achieving concrete results; Quick work means being swift in making decisions and being decisive, without procrastination or dragging one's feet, doing it as soon as it is said, in order to achieve administrative efficiency in the shortest possible time. If these can be achieved, then there can be truly working people, and we believe that things will definitely be done well. And with Secretary-General Luo's special emphasis on leading by example, if all the superiors can follow this spirit and practice it personally, then the top will influence the bottom, and there will be no problem with the administration getting on track.</p>
<p>Rectifying discipline and practicing clean governance is what we have always advocated. We have repeatedly and emphatically called for rectifying discipline and establishing clean governance. Embezzlement and bribery are the tumors of today's politics. If they are not strictly rectified, the future will be unimaginable. Especially in Shanghai, where the remnants of Anglo-American imperialism have not been completely eliminated and extravagance and depravity are rampant, the need to rectify discipline and establish clean governance is even more urgent than in other places. We hope that Mayor Zhou, Secretary Luo, and other superiors will, on the one hand, do their best to increase the compensation of on-the-job staff to ensure their minimum living standards, and on the other hand, severely punish those irresponsible people who take advantage of their positions to engage in embezzlement and bribery and harm the people with resolute measures. Moreover, right and wrong must be fair, and rewards and punishments must be clear. Only under the principle of fairness and clarity can clean governance be truly established. In addition, the extravagant and dissolute lifestyle that is currently felt among the special class and the nouveau riche should also be strictly rectified. Shifting the unnecessary consumption of these people to proper use and transferring the special waste of a few people to the enjoyment of the majority of people is the most reasonable thing to do. The allocation of electricity is one example.</p>
<p>Regarding increasing production and stabilizing people's livelihood, although this is also a cliché, there are ultimately very few who can truly strive to do it. There are many difficulties in these two matters, but it is clear that not enough effort has been made in the past. Currently, various production industries in Shanghai are in extreme decline due to restrictions on electricity, difficulties in raw materials, and various other obstacles, and some are even on the verge of extinction. If we do not seek to save them urgently, the crisis is too deep. An active way to stabilize people's livelihood is to increase production, while suppressing and leveling prices is an emergency measure. In recent years, the suffering of citizens from high prices has been truly indescribable. High prices can even be said to be the source of all the current suffering of citizens. The rise in prices is certainly due to the lack of material sources, but the speculative merchants' stirring up trouble, the collusion and hoarding by unscrupulous officials, and the condoning of the pursuit of exorbitant profits should also bear great responsibility. Therefore, in the process of rectifying discipline, how to eliminate the evildoing of corrupt officials and merchants colluding with each other should be one of the main objectives. In this way, the people's livelihood can at least be prevented from deteriorating further, and more strength can be used to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War.</p>

As for the aspect of compensation, they should consult with the mayor and find ways to improve it in order to secure a livelihood. At this time, in the midst of the Greater East Asia War, we should pay attention to thrift." He also instructed the future work direction: (1) All sections and offices should be closely linked to form a concrete manifestation of unified distribution, so that work can be smoothly advanced. (2) Work must be swift and efficient, and we should have the spirit of completing today's work today. (3) We must be truly responsible for our own work and must not engage in perfunctory fulfillment of duties. It is also heard that Chief Liu has adopted a talent-based approach to all staff members in the division. If they can fulfill their duties, they will be given considerable protection.</p>

<p>The forms for household movement certificates, etc., for household units of the police station in this city, have been printed by the competent department of the police bureau and distributed to the citizens by each sub-bureau for use. Previously, due to problems with printing, it was interrupted for a while. The Baojia (neighborhood watch) department has repeatedly urged the competent department to print them. It is heard that they have been printed and have been widely distributed to each sub-bureau for distribution to citizens. Those in need can request them from the sub-bureau in charge at any time, and pay a handling fee of five yuan when completing the movement procedures, without any other fees.</p>

<p>Readers' Scholarship News</p>
<h3>The Minimum Wish: 10,000 Per Person - Total Need is 45 Million; Already Secured 20 Million - Still Short 25 Million</h3>
<p>The eighth session of the scholarship fund managed by this newspaper was originally budgeted to require 30 million, which was the estimate in November of last year. Based on the price index at that time, it was thought that increasing it by one time compared to the seventh session would be sufficient. Little did we know that the budget had just been confirmed when we encountered a sharp change in prices in December. Therefore, this newspaper's budget of 30 million for the scholarship fund inevitably had to be increased to 45 million. How could this have been anticipated by this newspaper? And it finally became a shocking and sad reality! The staff of this newspaper, given the urgency of the scholarship movement, could not bear to sit idly by, and had no choice but to run around and appeal, and revive the spirit of "carrying on the past and opening up the future," and "catching up from behind." In addition to hoping that schools at all levels will cooperate closely to reduce tuition fees for poor students, we have decided to raise funds widely in order to achieve the goal of each person being able to obtain an average scholarship of 10,000. On this basis, 4,500 old students will require 45 million, while there is still no guarantee for new students. It is joyful to say! At this moment, 20 million has been raised, and 25 million is still short. It is planned to raise the full amount within 20 days, and then the merit will be completed, and everyone will be happy! It is hoped that our dear readers will keep this in mind and intensify their mobilization in order to be effective!</p>

<p>Pan Shi Elementary School Has the Lowest Tuition</p>
<p>A letter from Jaxi Road Elementary School states: "To whom it may concern, in recent weeks, prices in Shanghai have been soaring, and tuition fees for the next semester will inevitably rise. The number of poor and outstanding students who drop out of school will inevitably increase sharply. In view of this, we will take the aim of educating people for a hundred years and set the tuition fee to the lowest amount in order to reduce the burden on students' families to 6,000 yuan. In addition, we have specially set up a half-fee quota and a full-fee exemption quota for a total of 100 students to provide relief and avoid the hardship of dropping out of school, so as to leave a share of vitality for the country. At the same time, in view of your newspaper's dedication to the donation of scholarships, sparing no effort, your spirit is commendable. Therefore, we have specially set up 10 half-fee quotas, which will be recommended by your newspaper, to express our colleagues' pursuit of your newspaper's scholarship assistance."</p>

<p>Capital Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Work of the Wartime Construction Department</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Min Xian</p>
<p>Before the Incident, the affairs of the Railway and Transportation Departments, as well as urban water conservancy construction, were all merged into the Construction Department, making the department's work extremely important. Taking advantage of my stay in the capital, I paid a special visit to the department. It happened that Minister Chuan Shishuo was attending a water conservancy meeting, so I was received by Mr. Liu Chuanliang, the department's chief secretary. Mr. Liu previously served as the Administrative Inspector Commissioner and concurrently Security Commander of the Second District of Zhejiang Province, and was known for his governance and bandit suppression.</p>
<p>China Electricity Postal</p>
<p>The reporter first inquired about the situation of roads, electricity, mail, and aviation. Mr. Liu commented on the current difficulties in transportation, saying: "Taking the railways as an example, discipline is indeed worse than before the Incident. The department has previously made its best efforts within the possible scope to crack down on the black market for train tickets and to facilitate proper transportation. We will continue to advance along this path in the future, always striving to reduce all unreasonable situations. Regarding postal fees, they have already increased significantly, but postal workers still find it difficult to maintain a living due to rising prices. However, the department will pay attention to improving the sluggish delivery situation at any time. As for inland waterway navigation, unfortunate incidents have occurred several times in the past, resulting in many deaths, which is very distressing. The department will strictly enforce pre-incident crackdowns and post-incident punishments, hoping that such unfortunate incidents will not happen again in the future. However, during this extraordinary period, the four administrations of roads, electricity, mail, and aviation must prioritize military affairs, which will inevitably cause inconveniences."</p>
<p>Reclamation Project</p>
<p>Regarding the reclamation of East Tai Lake and the filling of Yinshan Lake, Mr. Liu said: "The national government has issued construction bonds to fund the reclamation of the lake and marsh areas of East Tai Lake. 13,000 mu of new farmland have been reclaimed, which can increase rice production by 48,000 shi per year, and also increase wheat production by the same amount. The Yinshan Lake project costs 50 million yuan, and the filled area reaches 10,000 mu. The above two projects are still being actively promoted, and will have a considerable effect on increasing production in the future." Finally, talking about the Nanjing Taihuai River dredging project, Mr. Liu said: "A dredging plan was drafted long before the Incident, but unfortunately it could not be realized. Minister Fu attaches great importance to the river's relationship to the capital's appearance and the people's health. When funding is available in the future, we will cooperate with the Nanjing Municipal Government to dredge it."</p>
<p>New Year's City Sounds</p>
<h3>Establishing a Wartime System in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wang Yang</p>
<p>It has been a full year since our country officially joined the Greater East Asia War on January 9th of this year. How much have we contributed to the war in this year? I am afraid that those who answer this question will be ashamed. Not to mention the contribution to the war, even the atmosphere of war in the country is very weak, and the breath of civilian participation in the war is very weak. Especially in Shanghai, it is still a world of singing and dancing, making people forget that most countries in the world are currently suffering from unprecedented war.</p>
<p>A long time ago, we saw in the newspaper that Germany closed all theaters and Japan also stopped performing songs and dramas to adapt to the wartime system. Looking around Shanghai, the hotels are still filled with the sound of mahjong tiles, the restaurants are still full of guests, and the dance halls are still filled with singing and dancing. I feel that the degree of luxury and debauchery in Shanghai is not less than before. Shanghai is also a city of participating countries. Anyone with a little brain will not only be ashamed, but simply heartbroken. How can we face the Allied nations who are doing their best under great hardships? At the same time, the authorities are shouting "Establish a wartime system" and "Implement a decisive battle life," but why not actively correct the various phenomena that should not exist in Shanghai during the war?</p>
<p>Historically, if the people remained dissolute and extravagant during wartime, it was a sign of national subjugation. Modern warfare is a total war. The decadent and disorganized lives of the people directly waste materials, time, and energy. As the Greater East Asia War evolves to a fever pitch today, we must loudly call out: "Establish Shanghai's wartime system"!</p>
<p>We hope that the new municipal authorities will deeply consider the following points. If they think it should be so, then resolutely implement it, without fear of any obstruction.</p>
<p>(1) Close all gambling institutions and convert these venues into public sports fields for citizens to exercise their bodies.</p>
<p>(2) Dance halls, song halls, and brothels should all be ordered to close.</p>
<p>(3) Reduce the number of theaters (including movies, dramas, storytelling, and local operas), and limit performances to those with meaning. All erotic, farcical, and decadent performances should be prohibited.</p>
<p>(4) Hotels should only allow legitimate lodging for travelers, and strictly prohibit all misconduct, such as gambling, drug use, and prostitution.</p>
<p>(5) Restaurants, tea houses, and cafes should not be allowed to sell expensive food, and increase the banquet tax as much as possible to reduce wasteful customers.</p>
<p>(6) Ban the manufacture and sale of luxury goods, such as cosmetics, fine clothing materials, and sweets and pastries.</p>
<p>After the above items are implemented one by one, the decadent atmosphere of the city will be greatly reduced. The entire city of Shanghai will be filled with the vitality of new life and the ability to fight a decisive battle, which will reduce a large amount of consumption and inspire the people. Therefore, establishing Shanghai's wartime system is a matter that brooks no delay, and we urge the municipal authorities to consider and implement it as soon as possible!</p>
