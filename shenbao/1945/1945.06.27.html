<h3>集結一億國民總力整備本土保衛戰　日政府當局闡明必勝信念</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　冲繩本島之地上戰鬭，日陸海空及官民雖曾團結一致，勇戰善圖，然　吿結束。値此敵軍侵犯本土愈形迫切之際，日政府為闡明當局之決意，並要求國民一億奮起，二十六日之定例閣議業巳決定公佈內閣告諭，道相於是下午二時晋宮奏請天皇陛下之批准，四時半業由情報局發表。</p>
<p>首相於該吿論中，闡切「恪遵宣戰詔書所昭示之聖訓，傾舉總力，攘敵於千里外」之不磨決心，此與日軍之作戰方針充實戰力，整頓國民組織相輔而行，確信本土決戰之必勝。最後對於一億國民，要求各體生死如一之日本魂，集中一切行動於戰力。此次之內閣吿渝，可謂係對於本土決戰之一億國民總進軍，殊堪注目也。</p>
<p>內閣吿諭內容</p>
<p>冲繩本島之守備，雖賴皇軍陸海空一體之勇戰奮鬬，與官民不屈之協力敢鬬，但終於無濟於事，誠惶誠恐。但日軍奮戰予敵之重大損害，對於使敵之作占工，不僅將發生製掣肘，且其精神上所蒙之打擊極大，此於日軍此後之進行戰爭，可以有利開展。又敵之空襲嗣後更將激烈，對於侵攻日本土亦不可不為之備，誠元寇以來之國難，帝國存亡秋也。神州係於御稜威下，我等相共護持，應永為我等子孫繼承不替之土地，縱不容外夷之侵犯，豈可任敵所蹂躪乎？蓋我等恪遵聖訓，義通奉公，朝野相依，隣保相助，尙道義，重節制。各精勵基聖務，益加昂揚士氣，傾舉國家之總力，以攘敵於千里之外。政府作戰之方針已定，充實戰力之施策亦逐日推進，並且國民義勇隊業已結成，國民之隊伍為之一新。政府依照從來迭次之聲明，決將果斷　進。本大臣當茲帝國存亡之關頭，對於國民更示以宣戰大詔，　望各奉體職旨，透澈生死如一之日本魂，自奮自勵，相互償賴，克服日趨嚴重之困難，進而集中一切之行動於戰勝一點，誓必克服此困難也。</p>

<h3>凉台閑話</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>宋翁出任行政院正副院長的意義</p>
<p>問：在你方才的談話中，毫未牽涉到中央政府　宋子評語派的關係，那末　　與中共對於此次宋子文翁文　出任行政院正副院長職，怎樣看法呢？同時再進一步說，此次重慶政權的改　，在世界史上　有何種意義呢？</p>
<p>答：中共認　　慶政　是地主階級與大金　資本家二者的聯合政治統稱，結合　兩個階級的，就是中央政府，就是中央軍　　　。重慶政權在經濟上，全靠地主階級過手所徵收的地租，以及大金融資本家借來的外債，和包辦入口的利益。再進一步說，中央政府的經費，是靠大金融資本家的「　活」手腕，　地方政府的經費，大部份則靠地租收入。同時，　隊旣然由地方政權的收入來供給開消，自然軍隊就和地主階級有密切不可分的關係。中央政府為使軍隊中央化，而實施地租直屬國庫制，於是改變了維持軍隊給養的制度，然而事實上，尙未產生有效的結果。因此，重慶政權只要大部份操縱在軍閥內閣手中，則想整頓地主階級手裏的舊式地方行政，是絕對困難的。地主階級旣然以地租徵收入的資格包辦地方行政，欲求近代化的開明中央政府出現，自然不啻緣木求魚。中央政府任命的地方官以及地方上的自治團體，共同辦理地方行政，於是中央政府的基礎，才能鞏固，中國的經濟發展，才能保證。走向這方面的發展，中國大金融本家也很希望。同時，蘇聯及中共為　除地主階級的封建勢力，也決不反對重慶政權走上這一方向。史太林在一九二七年俄國共產黨中央執行委員會上，曾就中國革命的前途說過如下的話：</p>
<p>「……一九二六年三月，蔣介石在國民黨中淸除共產黨的黨試，就是民族資產階級想操縱革命的最初級大嘗試，俄國共產黨中央委員會的見解，當時早巳經主張「必須嚴守共產黨留於國民黨中的方針」（一九二六年四月），這是人所共知的事。這就是一種方針：使革命更進一步地發展及共產黨員密切合作，藉揭穿和孤立左派，以建立國民黨的統一，使右派服從國民黨的紀律，只要右派服從國民黨的紀律，則加以利用，並利用他們的團體和經驗，如右派破壞紀律而背叛革命利益時，則把他們從國民黨中驅逐出去」。</p>
<p>不待言，現在和那時雖然情形有所不同，但等於現在此處所說的國民黨右派者，就是「反攻三位一體」。中共「在國民黨及國民政府的內部，與左派密切合作」，揭穿和孤立「反共三位一體」，可以說中共藉此在忠實地執行這一方針。另外一方面，美國也不贊成國民黨右派那種公然露骨的反共政策。因此國民黨左派的走上政治舞台，進而再取消蔣介石的獨裁，這都是蘇聯和美國所歡迎的。不管蔣介石個人高興與否，只要大勢所趨，都希望這樣作，自然蔣介石也只好掉個方向。所以此次宋子文仇灝出任行政院正副院長，這是由於各方面意志的一致要求所致。</p>
<p>蔣介石的立塲</p>
<p>問：然則為什麼蔣介石不早一點走上這個方向呢？</p>
<p>答：我認為蔣介石的立塲如下：</p>
<p>一·他廢寢忘食所希望者，是統一中國。像他這樣世上少有的實際政治家，是很知道重慶政權為毫無組織而又極端散漫的統治階緣之結合體的。他知道，國民黨內部人事的勾心鬬角，借綜複雜，足使重慶政權無法實施具有革命性的政策。他也知道，國民黨中就沒有足以克服這種意見紛岐，相互對立的指導理論。固然在形式上有大家分認的三民主義理論，但實質上除掉民族主義外，對於「民生」「民權」二者的解釋，可以說，國民黨內部有多少黨員，竟有多少不同的意見。他領導着這樣一個一盤散砂的政黨，總是絞腦榨計，煞費苦心，追求內部勢力的均衡。因此，周圍的客觀環境非到萬不得巳時，即非達到所謂「最後關頭」時，換言之，非統治階級的大部份認為必要時，他是不能對國策實行革命性改革的。</p>
<p>二·同時蔣介石也知道，中共總是利用這種政策改革，而擴大勢力，所以他很怕這種結果。革命本來是食禁無厭的，一個改革完了，而又要求革一個改，結果是一個一個地被改革下去。所以，歷史上的保守主義者，總是盡量保守旣存的制度。蔣介石也不例外，他對於國內的改革也是採取同樣態度的。</p>
<p>三·正因為他是一個保守主義者，所以他也是國粹民族主義者。他在中國一脈相傳的家族制度中，發現了國家統一的靱帶。在發現代替這一靱帶的新國家統一要素前，他是不肯輕易放棄道德的。旣然維持中國舊道德是地主階級，所以蔣介石特別不願發生地主階級的沒落與淪亡現象。因為他知道中國的金融資本家是帶着美國金融資本家彩色的買辦性質的，而中國金融資本家愈受外國金融資本家的壓迫，則對於國內的農村經濟，因而更加必須依靠地主階級；所以就是從經濟觀點上看，他也認為地主階級是國家的骨幹。所以他想，為使落後的中國工業發達，縱全相當嚴酷地剝削農民，也是發展國家過程中難見的事。</p>
<p>四·最後，他認為無論現在　界形勢有如何變化，統一中國是最必要的。現在國際外交中有兩個太陽系。一個是美國為中心而英國及南美各國等為衛星的太陽系；另一個是蘇聯為中心而巴爾幹半島各國，波羅的海岸各國，以及波蘭等為衛星的太陽系。這兩個太陽系，都在用强大的吸引力，想把尙未加入任何一個太陽系的幾個國家，吸引到自己方面來。假如重慶和日本間不能實現全面和平的話。則重慶本身只有靠强而有力的國家統一，才能抵抗這兩種吸引力。如果中國常此以往保持現在這種態度，則大有可能被兩個太陽系的吸引力所分裂。職是之故，蔣介石愈想拼命被完成中國的統一。因此，中共很怕被蔣介石所「統一」了去，於是便對國民黨愈益採取敵對態度。這樣一來，國共關係的摩擦就愈演愈烈了。毛澤東在中共七全大會上，痛加指摘蔣介石對於由美國輸入的武器，並不用於對日總反攻上，而準備用於未來反共內戰上。自然這種指摘是合乎事實的。然而蔣介石也並不是想把全部武器用在反對中國共產黨上。他以為中國如有了近代化裝備武裝起來的三百萬大軍，就可以臨傲地立於美蘇之間，而保持他所想的獨立。</p>
<p>上述蔣介石的立塲，對於蘇聯的動向是有莫大影響的。日美間的鬥爭，在蘇聯看來固然是爭奪中國市塲的帝國主義戰爭，然而在中國關係上，蘇聯則認為日美侵略戰爭，所以史大林曾經聲明，日本為侵略國。重慶方面便應聲大吹大擂，誇大宣傳，說史太林這一聲明，是蘇聯參加太平洋戰爭的前奏，並說只要美國一開始大陸作戰，蘇聯則立刻出兵滿洲。然就重慶權的目前傾向看，我們可以斷定假如蘇聯現在出兵，武裝制止大東亞戰爭，則重慶會利用這一機會，動發反共內戰，藉美國力量以解除中共武裝。在這種情形下，只要蘇聯不坐視中共不救，則中國的內戰，一定有可能發展成為第二個西班牙的內亂。因此，在重慶政權內部，能調和渝美對延蘇關係好轉的勢力未產生前，蘇聯會避免參戰的。在重慶政權內這種形勢在發展着，並且一向使蘇聯逃避參戰的各種要素　除後，蘇聯對太平洋間題的發言權，也不一定會因此而驟然喪失。接重慶及蘇聯的現狀言，起碼可以說阻撓蘇聯參戰的因素尙在方興未艾之際，蘇聯決不會冒然參戰的。（完）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>掃除政治革新的障礙</h3>
<p>現時局下急須革新政治，以期實現加强政治力量，完遂大東亞戰爭，巳經用不着再加解釋了。但是，我們提出革新政治的要求，已有相當時間，而實際上在若干方面，仍有待於全面和澈底的革新，推其主要原因，則在革新政治要求的前面，尙存在許多障礙，這些障礙也許在表面上看不淸楚，有如海洋面上小小一點礁石，或有如鐵路軌道上幾枚螺絲釘腐朽了，駕駛輪船和火車者偶不經心，便會闖下一塲大禍來。因為小小的礁石，在海底實在是一座大山，而幾枚螺絲釘的腐朽，實在又為養路護路工作玩忽的反映。我們站在輿論的立塲，對於革新政治途上這種暗礁和機構中若干部分的腐朽，自不能不隨時向駕駛人大聲疾呼不要漠視！不能姑息！</p>
<p>舉一個例來說吧：這次鬧得滿城風雨的票據貼現暗市飛增的風潮，表在上看來，是經濟方面偶然發生的現象。但是，貼現的暗潮，實在早巳潛伏了，不過，過去大家漫不經心，似乎平安無事。然而巳經　發了少數非法金融業者的貪心，所以，到了這次，便又乘機而人為地造成現鈔缺乏現象，濫發信用通貨，同時轉移大量現鈔以向一般大衆奪取高率貼現的非法收益，結果更造成社會經濟的混亂，當局若再位，便可巧取豪奪，暢所欲為，還說得上什麼政治革新？還談得上什麼加强政治力量？</p>
<p>當然，我們所舉這個例子，是暗礁的一個罷了。諸如此類的暗礁，存在於接阻　政治革新前途的，還不知有多少！</p>
<p>再舉一個例來說，這次食糧狂　風潮，影響了多少人的生活，誰也想得到的。由不足十萬元一石的米價，在不到一個月的期間，一度高漲到差不多就是一百萬元，現在米價雖已因政府緊急而度下跌，總算已趨平穩了。但是，事實上決不是薪水階級所能負担。最大多數人民的生活上的威脅，賢明的政府當局，固然是非常關注而且力謀解救的。但是，有沒有檢查到造成今日這種危險現狀的癥結？有沒有查出那幾隻螺絲釘或軌條腐朽了？我們曾經一再向當局提供，要求澈底檢查，不可姑息。當局似乎已檢查到了，所以採取這次特別緊急措置。但是，我們還曾指出，單是應急還不夠，尙有第二步辦法得實施。</p>
<p>這理所舉的是關於螺絲釘腐朽的例子，諸如此類的腐朽，存在於直接阻礙政治革新前途，的，當然還是不少。</p>
<p>不漠視現實，不姑息事實，迴避暗礁，撤換腐朽的螺絲釘，向「政治革新」之途前進的輪船和火車；才會平安抵達目的地。我們今日蒿目時艱，不寒而慄，不得不再向賢明的駕駛者呼籲：不要漠視現視！不要姑息事實！</p>

<h3>夏季家庭用水　供量不致減少　水電公司盼用戶節約消費</h3>
<p>時屆夏令，氣候日漸炎熱，居民用水量當更增加，最折外傳華中水電公司方面對夏季用水量有加限制之說，中央社記者於昨日特走訪該公司當局詢問，據訓：公司方面鑒於用戶方面每年四季需用水量時有增減。茲特規定每年四季之消費量，計春季爲三四五月，供給量百分之一百。夏季六七八月，供給百分之一百十八。秋季爲九十十一月，供給百分之一百零七。冬季爲十二月一月二月，供給百分之八十八。故公司方面對夏季之家庭用戶，決不致有減少供給量情事，查公司生產水量，將汚穢黃浦江水，予以整理淸潔，供給用戶，其手續不但需頗大之電力，更需用頗多之潔水料品，而電力與潔水料品，尤對戰力之增强上，關係至鉅。在夏季之用水消費當必增加，公司方而對一般消費者，請予盡力減省，節約不需要之用水，深望各界協助。</p>
<h3>停止開發撥款單　消滅貼現惡風　整個金融物價亦可穩定</h3>

<h3>Gathering a Hundred Million National Strength to Prepare for the Homeland Defense War: The Japanese Government Clarifies its Belief in Certain Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – The ground battles on Okinawa Island, although the Japanese army, navy, air force, and civilians were united, fought bravely, and planned well, have come to an end. As the enemy's invasion of the homeland becomes increasingly urgent, the Japanese government, in order to clarify its determination and call for the awakening of a hundred million citizens, decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 26th to announce a Cabinet Edict. The Prime Minister then went to the Imperial Palace at 2 PM to seek His Majesty the Emperor's approval, and the Information Bureau announced it at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>In the Edict, the Prime Minister earnestly expounded the unwavering determination to "strictly abide by the sacred instructions shown in the declaration of war, and exert all our strength to drive the enemy out of our land," which is supplemented by the Japanese military's operational policy of strengthening combat power and reorganizing national organizations, firmly believing in the inevitable victory of the homeland decisive battle. Finally, he called on the hundred million citizens to embody the Japanese spirit of treating life and death as one, and to concentrate all actions on combat power. This Cabinet Edict can be said to be a general mobilization of a hundred million citizens for the homeland decisive battle, and is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Contents of the Cabinet Edict</p>
<p>The defense of Okinawa Island, although relying on the brave battles of the Imperial Army, Navy, and Air Force as one, and the unyielding cooperation and courageous struggles of officials and civilians, ultimately proved futile, which is a matter of deep regret. However, the significant damage inflicted on the enemy by the Japanese military's desperate fight will not only restrain the enemy's operational efforts but also inflict great mental blows, which will be beneficial to the future conduct of the Japanese military. Moreover, the enemy's air raids will become more intense in the future, and preparations must be made for the invasion of the Japanese homeland. This is a national crisis since the Mongol invasions, a critical moment for the survival of the Empire. The divine land is under the protection of His Majesty's spirit, and we must jointly protect it as land that should be eternally inherited by our descendants, and should never be invaded by foreign barbarians, let alone be trampled by the enemy. Therefore, we must strictly abide by the sacred instructions, uphold righteousness and serve the public, rely on each other in government and society, and help each other as neighbors, valuing morality and emphasizing restraint. Each should diligently perform their sacred duties, further enhance morale, and exert the overall strength of the nation to drive the enemy out of our land. The government's operational policy has been determined, and measures to strengthen combat power are being promoted daily. Furthermore, the National Volunteer Corps has been formed, and the national ranks have been renewed. The government, in accordance with repeated statements from the past, is determined to advance resolutely. At this critical juncture for the survival of the Empire, this minister further shows the people the great declaration of war, hoping that each will embody the spirit of treating life and death as one, encourage and motivate themselves, rely on each other, overcome increasingly serious difficulties, and concentrate all actions on winning the war, vowing to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Found Moving near Kerama Islands, Japanese Air Force Launches Repeated Fierce Attacks</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 26th (Central News Agency) – From the night of the 25th to the morning of the 26th, the Japanese Air Force repeatedly and fiercely attacked enemy warships and airfields around Okinawa Island. Recently, the number of carrier-based fighters at enemy airfields in Okinawa has decreased, while the number of land-based aircraft has increased. Also, near the Kerama Islands, enemy battleships, cruisers (three of each), and approximately 200 transport ships of various sizes were found to be moving.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 26th (Central News Agency) – When the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy warships around Okinawa on the 22nd, it achieved the results of sinking or destroying seven enemy destroyers. It was later confirmed that one enemy cruiser caught fire.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Land on Ternate Island, Japanese Garrison Engages in Counterattack</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 26th (Central News Agency) – On the 25th, approximately 300 enemy troops landed on Ternate Island, west of Halmahera Island. The Japanese garrison immediately engaged in combat and is currently fighting fiercely.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – At 1:59 AM on the 26th, one enemy U.S. Air Force B-24 aircraft from Chongqing airspace invaded the skies over Nanjing, circled briefly, and then fled to the southeast.</p>
<h3>Zhao Xuanzhang's Broadcast Last Night</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – Minister of Propaganda Zhao Zunyue broadcast on the Central Broadcasting Station from 8:50 PM to 9:10 PM on the 26th, with the topic "The Understanding that the People of the Country Should Have of the Current Stage of the East Asian War," explaining the future intentions of the American forces and the strength of Japan's defense, which will surely strike the enemy and complete the East Asian War.</p>
<h3>Japanese Diplomats Stationed in Germany Transferred to the United States</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) – Washington: The U.S. Department of the Interior announced yesterday that 132 members of the Japanese Embassy in Germany and their families who were arrested in Germany will be transferred to the United States and detained in Pennsylvania. They are expected to arrive in the United States in early July and will remain there until an exchange agreement is established between Japan, the United States, and the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Casual Chats from the Veranda</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>The Significance of Song Weng's Appointment as President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Question: In your previous remarks, you did not involve the relationship between the Central Government and Song Ziwen's appraisal faction. What are the views of the Communist Party of China (CPC) regarding Song Ziwen's appointment as President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan? Furthermore, what is the historical significance of this change in the Chongqing regime?</p>
<p>Answer: The CPC believes that the Chongqing regime is a united political designation of the landlord class and big financial capitalists. The Central Government and the Central Army combine these two classes. Economically, the Chongqing regime relies entirely on land rent collected by the landlord class, foreign debts borrowed by big financial capitalists, and the profits from monopolized imports. Furthermore, the Central Government's expenses rely on the "flexible" methods of big financial capitalists, while the local governments' expenses largely rely on land rent income. At the same time, since the army's expenses are supplied by the income of the local government, the army naturally has a close and inseparable relationship with the landlord class. In order to centralize the army, the Central Government implemented a system of directly allocating land rent to the national treasury, thereby changing the system of maintaining the army's supplies. However, in reality, it has not produced effective results. Therefore, as long as the Chongqing regime is largely controlled by the warlord cabinet, it is absolutely difficult to rectify the old-style local administration in the hands of the landlord class. Since the landlord class monopolizes local administration with the qualifications of land rent collection, it is naturally impossible to expect the emergence of a modern and enlightened central government. Only when the local officials appointed by the Central Government and the local autonomous organizations jointly handle local administration can the foundation of the Central Government be consolidated and China's economic development be guaranteed. China's big financial capitalists also hope to move in this direction. At the same time, the Soviet Union and the CPC will not oppose the Chongqing regime moving in this direction in order to eliminate the feudal forces of the landlord class. Stalin once said the following about the future of the Chinese revolution at the Central Executive Committee of the Russian Communist Party in 1927:</p>
<p>"...In March 1926, Chiang Kai-shek's purge of the Communist Party in the Kuomintang was the first major attempt by the national bourgeoisie to control the revolution. The Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party had already advocated that "the policy of the Communist Party remaining in the Kuomintang must be strictly observed" (April 1926), which is well known. This is a policy: to further develop the revolution and closely cooperate with the Communist Party members, to establish the unity of the Kuomintang by exposing and isolating the left wing, and to make the right wing obey the discipline of the Kuomintang. As long as the right wing obeys the discipline of the Kuomintang, it should be utilized, and their organizations and experience should be utilized. If the right wing violates the discipline and betrays the interests of the revolution, they should be expelled from the Kuomintang."</p>
<p>Needless to say, although the situation is different now, the "anti-communist trinity" is equivalent to the Kuomintang right wing mentioned here. It can be said that the CPC is faithfully implementing this policy by "closely cooperating with the left wing inside the Kuomintang and the Kuomintang government" to expose and isolate the "anti-communist trinity." On the other hand, the United States also does not approve of the Kuomintang right wing's blatant anti-communist policy. Therefore, the rise of the Kuomintang left wing to the political stage and the subsequent abolition of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship are welcomed by the Soviet Union and the United States. Regardless of whether Chiang Kai-shek himself is happy or not, as long as the general trend is towards this direction, he will naturally have to change direction. Therefore, Song Ziwen's appointment as President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan is due to the unanimous demands of all parties.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Position</p>
<p>Question: Then why didn't Chiang Kai-shek move in this direction earlier?</p>
<p>Answer: I believe Chiang Kai-shek's position is as follows:</p>
<p>1. What he hopes for day and night is the unification of China. As a rare practical politician in the world, he knows very well that the Chongqing regime is a combination of ruling classes with no organization and extreme disorganization. He knows that the internal personnel infighting within the Kuomintang is so complex that it prevents the Chongqing regime from implementing revolutionary policies. He also knows that there is no guiding theory within the Kuomintang that is sufficient to overcome such divergent opinions and mutual opposition. Of course, in form, there is the theory of the Three People's Principles, which is recognized by everyone, but in essence, apart from nationalism, there are as many different opinions on the interpretation of "people's livelihood" and "people's rights" as there are Kuomintang members. Leading such a party that is a heap of loose sand, he is always racking his brains and painstakingly pursuing a balance of internal forces. Therefore, he cannot implement revolutionary reforms to the national policy unless the surrounding objective environment is absolutely necessary, that is, unless it reaches the so-called "final moment," in other words, unless the majority of the ruling class deems it necessary.</p>
<p>2. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek also knows that the CPC always uses this kind of policy reform to expand its power, so he is very afraid of this result. Revolution is inherently insatiable. After one reform is completed, another reform is demanded, and as a result, they are reformed one by one. Therefore, historical conservatives always try their best to preserve the existing system. Chiang Kai-shek is no exception, and he takes the same attitude towards domestic reforms.</p>
<p>3. Precisely because he is a conservative, he is also a nationalist. He discovered the bond of national unity in the family system that has been passed down in China for generations. Before discovering a new national unity element to replace this bond, he is unwilling to easily abandon morality. Since maintaining China's old morality is the landlord class, Chiang Kai-shek is particularly unwilling to see the decline and demise of the landlord class. Because he knows that China's financial capitalists have the comprador nature of American financial capitalists, and the more China's financial capitalists are oppressed by foreign financial capitalists, the more they must rely on the landlord class for the domestic rural economy; therefore, from an economic point of view, he also believes that the landlord class is the backbone of the country. Therefore, he thinks that in order for China's backward industry to develop, even if it is a fairly harsh exploitation of farmers, it is a rare thing in the process of national development.</p>
<p>4. Finally, he believes that no matter how the current world situation changes, unifying China is the most necessary thing. There are two solar systems in the current international diplomacy. One is the solar system centered on the United States with the United Kingdom and South American countries as satellites; the other is the solar system centered on the Soviet Union with the Balkan countries, the Baltic coast countries, and Poland as satellites. Both solar systems are using strong attraction to try to attract several countries that have not yet joined any solar system to their side. If a comprehensive peace cannot be realized between Chongqing and Japan, then Chongqing itself can only resist these two kinds of attraction by relying on a strong and powerful national unity. If China continues to maintain its current attitude, it is likely to be divided by the attraction of the two solar systems. For this reason, Chiang Kai-shek wants to complete the unification of China as desperately as possible. Therefore, the CPC is very afraid of being "unified" by Chiang Kai-shek, so it is taking an increasingly hostile attitude towards the Kuomintang. As a result, the friction between the Kuomintang and the CPC is becoming more and more intense. Mao Zedong severely criticized Chiang Kai-shek at the Seventh National Congress of the CPC for not using the weapons imported from the United States for the general counter-offensive against Japan, but for preparing for a future anti-communist civil war. Naturally, this criticism is consistent with the facts. However, Chiang Kai-shek did not intend to use all the weapons to oppose the Communist Party of China. He believed that if China had a modernized and armed army of three million, it could proudly stand between the United States and the Soviet Union and maintain the independence he wanted.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned Chiang Kai-shek's position has a great influence on the movements of the Soviet Union. From the Soviet Union's point of view, the struggle between Japan and the United States is of course an imperialist war to compete for the Chinese market. However, in relation to China, the Soviet Union considers the Japanese-American war of aggression, so Stalin once declared that Japan is an aggressor country. The Chongqing side immediately echoed this with great fanfare, exaggerating the propaganda, saying that Stalin's statement was a prelude to the Soviet Union's participation in the Pacific War, and said that as long as the United States started mainland operations, the Soviet Union would immediately send troops to Manchuria. However, judging from the current tendency of the Chongqing regime, we can determine that if the Soviet Union sends troops now to armedly stop the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing will use this opportunity to launch an anti-communist civil war, using American power to disarm the CPC. Under such circumstances, as long as the Soviet Union does not sit idly by and ignore the CPC, the Chinese civil war is bound to develop into a second Spanish civil war. Therefore, before the emergence of forces within the Chongqing regime that can harmonize the relationship between Chongqing and the United States with the improvement of the relationship between Yan'an and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will avoid participating in the war. This situation is developing within the Chongqing regime, and after the various factors that have caused the Soviet Union to avoid participating in the war are eliminated, the Soviet Union's right to speak on the Pacific issue will not necessarily be lost suddenly. Judging from the current situation of Chongqing and the Soviet Union, it can at least be said that the factors hindering the Soviet Union's participation in the war are still flourishing, and the Soviet Union will never rashly participate in the war.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Removing Obstacles to Political Reform</h3>
<p>At the present juncture, it is urgently necessary to reform politics in order to strengthen political power and complete the Greater East Asia War. However, we have been calling for political reform for quite some time, but in reality, in some respects, it still needs comprehensive and thorough reform. The main reason for this is that there are still many obstacles in front of the demand for political reform. These obstacles may not be clear on the surface, like a small reef on the ocean surface, or like a few rusty screws on the railway track. If the drivers of ships and trains are careless, they will cause a disaster. Because a small reef is actually a large mountain at the bottom of the sea, and the rust of a few screws is actually a reflection of the neglect of road maintenance work. Standing in the position of public opinion, we cannot but shout loudly to the drivers at any time not to ignore these reefs and the decay of some parts of the organization on the road of political reform! Cannot condone!</p>
<p>Let's take an example: this time, the storm of the soaring black market of bill discounting, which has been raging in the city, seems to be an accidental phenomenon in the economic field on the surface. However, the dark tide of discounting has actually been lurking for a long time, but in the past, everyone was indifferent, and it seemed that everything was safe. However, it has already stimulated the greed of a few illegal financiers, so this time, they took the opportunity to artificially create a phenomenon of cash shortage, excessively issued credit currency, and at the same time transferred a large amount of cash to seize the illegal income of high-rate discounting from the general public, resulting in further chaos in the social economy. What political reform can be talked about if the authorities can still seize and exploit at will? What can be talked about strengthening political power?</p>
<p>Of course, the example we have cited is just one of the reefs. There are countless reefs of this kind that exist in front of the road to political reform!</p>
<p>Let's take another example. How many people's lives have been affected by the food frenzy this time? Everyone can imagine it. The price of rice, which was less than 100,000 yuan per stone, once rose to almost 1 million yuan in less than a month. Now, although the price of rice has fallen due to the government's emergency measures, it can be considered to have stabilized. However, in fact, it is definitely not affordable for the salaried class. The wise government authorities are of course very concerned about and trying to rescue the threat to the lives of the vast majority of people. However, have they checked the crux of the dangerous situation that has caused today's situation? Have they found out which screws or rails are rusty? We have repeatedly provided the authorities and requested a thorough inspection, which should not be condoned. The authorities seem to have checked it, so they took this special emergency measure this time. However, we have also pointed out that emergency measures alone are not enough, and a second step must be implemented.</p>
<p>The examples cited here are about the decay of screws. Of course, there are still many such decays that exist in directly hindering the future of political reform.</p>
<p>Not ignoring reality, not condoning facts, avoiding reefs, replacing rusty screws, the ships and trains that move forward on the road of "political reform" will arrive safely at their destination. Today, when we are facing difficulties and shuddering, we must once again appeal to the wise drivers: do not ignore reality! Do not condone the facts!</p>

<h3>Summer Household Water Usage: Supply Will Not Be Reduced; Water and Electricity Company Hopes Users Conserve Consumption</h3>
<p>As the summer season arrives, the climate is becoming increasingly hot, and residents' water consumption will inevitably increase. There have been rumors that the China Water and Electricity Company will restrict summer water consumption. A Central News Agency reporter visited the company's authorities yesterday to inquire. According to them: The company has considered that users' water consumption varies in different seasons each year. Therefore, the company has specifically stipulated the consumption volume for each season each year. The supply volume is 100% in spring (March, April, and May), 118% in summer (June, July, and August), 107% in autumn (September, October, and November), and 88% in winter (December, January, and February). Therefore, the company will not reduce the supply of water to household users in summer. It is found that the company produces water by cleaning and purifying the polluted Huangpu River water for supply to users. The procedure not only requires a large amount of electricity but also a large amount of clean water materials. Electricity and clean water materials are particularly important for enhancing combat power. Water consumption will inevitably increase in the summer. The company asks consumers to make every effort to reduce and save unnecessary water consumption, and hopes for assistance from all sectors.</p>
<h3>Stop Issuing Transfer Drafts: Eliminate the Evil Practice of Discounting; The Entire Financial and Price System Can Also Be Stabilized</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of banning the discounting of transfer drafts, the Central Reserve Bank convened a joint meeting of the banking and money industries on the 20th of this month. It was decided that from July 3rd, all banks and money shops would cease issuing transfer drafts drawn on the Central Reserve Bank, the Reserve Fund, and the money house. In addition to cash, banks and money shops may issue crossed immediate bank drafts to customers for payment. According to relevant authorities, the cessation of issuing transfer drafts this time can immediately eliminate the malignant expansion of bill credit. Not only can the practice of discounting be eradicated, but the entire financial and price system can also be stabilized. The Financial Affairs Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank has recently inspected the business of various financial institutions over the past week, examining the account books of customer deposits and cash on hand. It was found that not only were there actual instances of discounting transfer drafts, but there were even empty transfer drafts issued exceeding twenty times the deposit reserve. These empty transfer drafts flow into the speculative market, buying stocks and hoarding other commodities related to people's livelihood, manipulating market prices to rise wildly. This is purely caused by this kind of bad and illegal behavior. In recent years, newly established financial institutions account for about 80% of the total. Therefore, the entire financial situation in Shanghai is seriously affected. Therefore, stopping the issuance of transfer drafts immediately eliminates the speculative craze. For the adjustment of cash, supply and withdrawal will be based on the standard of deposit reserve funds paid by various financial institutions. Customers of each bank and money shop can also withdraw cash based on the standard of deposit amount, which will show fairness.</p>

<h3>Police Officer on Changde Road Captures Armed Robbers</h3>
<p>Rice merchant Xu Bao-da was carrying cash at around 8:30 AM yesterday (26th) when he was riding his bicycle near Zhongshan Road and Hongqiao. He was suddenly encountered by armed thugs impersonating public officials, who threatened him with a gun under the pretext of inspection, and forcibly robbed him of 350,000 yuan in cash, which they handed over to another accomplice and fled without a trace. Then they threatened Xu Bin-da, demanding that he take his bicycle to the Lujiawan Branch for investigation, attempting to escape in the meantime. Xu Dao-chu refused to give up. When they reached the intersection of Taishan Road and Wukang Road, Xu reported to the police officer on duty. The police officer tried to arrest them, but the robbers refused to be arrested and fired their guns. The police officer fired back and blew his whistle. Police officers nearby rushed to encircle and arrest them. The robbers fired their guns again and fled towards Wanping Road. Then they jumped on an eastbound tram. Seeing the police officers chasing them, they jumped off the tram again at the Gaolan Road intersection and fled north. When they reached the intersection of Taishan Road and South Dihua Road, they fired another shot at police officer No. 4985 on duty. The police officer fired back but missed. The robbers continued to flee towards Dongping Road. At this time, detective Liu Fu-lai of the Fourth Squad arrived at the scene on foot and immediately borrowed a bicycle to chase after them. The robber ran to the intersection of Dongping Road and Yueyang Road and aimed his gun at the detective. Fortunately, the bullet jammed and failed to fire. The detective ducked to avoid the shot, jumped off the bicycle, ran forward, grabbed the robber's wrist, and kicked him down, seizing the pistol. At this time, police officer No. 4985 helped arrest the robber and quickly took him and the weapon to the branch. The branch director, Yu, handed the case over to the Third Squad for investigation and ordered all police officers to search for the escaped accomplice, so as not to let anyone escape.

More than a dozen representatives from various women and children's charities attended. Mr. Huang Jingzhai (represented by Hu Yimeng), director of the Sea and Land Transportation Committee of the Population Evacuation Committee, presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Two Purposes of Mandatory Evacuation</p>
<p>The chairman first explained the purpose of the mandatory evacuation of charitable organizations, stating, "The purpose of this mandatory evacuation of charitable organizations is twofold: first, to reduce the consumption of food caused by the prolonged stay of charitable organizations in Shanghai, and second, to avoid the danger of air raids in urban areas for women and children. The destination of this evacuation is the fertile Xishan Island in Dongting Lake. Our Xishan office has already arranged accommodation, so there will be absolutely no problem with the living conditions of the women and children. This committee is absolutely responsible. We hope that the charities will no longer wait and see, and will quickly submit the current number of people in the charitable organizations, as well as the overview of income and expenditure, to the committee so that we can start immediately." Subsequently, representatives of the various charities exchanged opinions on issues such as food supply after the evacuation, and agreed to submit the list of women and children remaining in Shanghai to the committee for consultation within a few days.

Committee member Zong Jingze of the Land Transportation Committee represented Director Huang Jingzhai as chairman. The chairman first delivered a speech, stating, "The Land Transportation Committee has dispatched personnel to negotiate with the China Central Railway Company to arrange transportation for the evacuation of people from Nanjing and northern China. Once a certain number of people have gathered from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, the company will fully assist, and if necessary, add special train cars. The committee will dispatch personnel to escort the evacuees along the way. The fare and luggage will be handled according to the regulations of China Central Railway. As for the economic assistance for those who are poor and unable to afford it, the native place associations will find ways to help. In short, this committee is absolutely responsible for the evacuated people. There are three points that can be clarified: The fare will be according to regulations, and there will be absolutely no corruption. The committee will dispatch personnel to take care of the group evacuation along the way to avoid the trouble of military card inspections. Issuance of certificates to prove that they are good citizens evacuating from Shanghai to return to their hometowns, and rapid registration of their household registration. The evacuation work has now reached the implementation stage. The committee urgently needs the exact number of people returning to their hometowns in order to prepare vehicles and tickets. We hope that the representatives attending today will proceed as soon as possible." Subsequently, Yan Cirong, the representative of the Hebei Native Place Association, expressed his opinion on the currency system issue for the evacuees and requested assistance if there are any difficulties.

<p>Saving Breakfast to Donate to Charity School Funds</p>
<p>Reader Lin Zongzheng wrote, "I feel that there are many young people who are eager to learn. Learning is the only spiritual food for them. Their love for learning is so urgent! For the sake of the future masters and for the sake of moral assistance, we have an unshirkable duty to do our bit. However, as a wage earner with a very low income, I can only go hungry for a few days for breakfast. Therefore, I am willing to donate the money I save in three days (800 yuan per day, totaling 2,400 yuan) to your newspaper's "charity school fund." By chance, some young people who had to work because they lost the opportunity to study saw this and expressed great sympathy. They volunteered to donate 1,600 yuan to make it a round number. Finally, I earnestly hope that everyone in the world will fulfill their human obligations, contribute their strength if they have strength, and contribute their money if they have money, to this most meaningful cause!"</p>
