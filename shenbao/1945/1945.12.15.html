<h3>馬歇爾已結束作證事　下週可抵華履新　赫爾利將重返其律師生涯</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕新任美國駐華大使前陸軍參謀總長馬歇爾將軍，出席珍珠港慘禍調查委員會作證，接連七日，已於今日結束其證詞。馬氏承認於一九四一年十二月七日，可以電話通知夏威夷施行戒備，而不致揭破繙查日本密電之秘密。惟夏威夷美軍司令旭德中將接得比項電話警吿，已在日軍偸製之後。當馬氏出席委員會時，飛機一架，已在機場等候，預備載馬氏赴華履新，故發言旣畢，即於載掌聲中匆匆而去。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕「華盛頓郵報」今日社評稱：杜魯門總統駐華特使馬歇爾將軍之主要任務，實與其前任赫爾利少將無異，即鼓勵中國中央政府之趨於自由化是已。中國問題在即將開幕之莫斯科三國外長會議中其重要性僅次於原子炸彈。美蘇對華政策之一致，最爲吾人關切。目前兩國固均承認重慶中央政府爲唯一政府，但中國大局尙未穩定，隨時可生變化，則吾人政策，必須能適應變遷不已之事實，始能應付裕如。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十四日電〕據美新聞處華盛頓十三日電，據美國新聞社訊，赫爾利最近將重返其律師生涯。赫氏昨日臥病，據其親近友人云：赫氏歡迎聽取事件報吿之結束，渠並相信此項聽取結果，將產生美國對華政策之「大白」，此在遠東方面，業已收獲良好效果也。論及馬帥就任駐華特使事，赫氏謂：美對華政策之聲明，「使余之繼任者之成功得以確定」。據赫氏意見，外交政策之各方面，皆應經常公佈予人民，蓋創制或廢除外交政策，究竟出於人民之手也。按赫氏之重返律師生涯，即結束其五年服務美軍及國務院生活之謂也。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐的十四日電〕今日「星期新聞」雜誌載：自「赫爾利事件」以來，華萊士爲杜魯門總統之經常顧問。據該雜誌稱，設法使中國國民黨與共產黨言歸於好者，當以華氏爲最早。</p>
<h3>政府發言人詳舉事實　盼共黨勿作混淆宣傳</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十四日電〕本社記者以新華社，新華日報經常報導國軍進攻「解放區」，並提出「反內戰」口號，擴大宣傳，特向政府發言人詢問其意見，政府發言人答稱，中共一貫的宣傳策略，即為凡其自已所想作之事，而明知為公理所不許可者，即一而實際照其計劃進行，一面大肆宣傳，謂對方正在如此做法，以便轉變視綫，推卸責任，隱蔽其自身之企圖及行動。新華社及新華日報之報導看他如此，其實祇須完全客觀的從事宣方面考查，則知其所謂國軍進攻「解放區」，實際乃是共軍阻擾國軍繳降，其所宜傳反對之「內戰」，實即係共黨本身製造內亂，此可就在日本投降以後，共黨用武力擴大其地盤，及在十月十日政府與中共代表會談紀要發表以後，政府與共黨代表繼續商談的各種事實來作證明。</p>
<p>「解放」實即是「割據」</p>
<p>依照本年六月底「延安總部」所自製的「中國抗戰敵後戰塲形勢要圖」，共黨所佔據的縣城，在全國只有六十九個，包括所謂「陝甘寗邊區』，即延安等縣在內，根據共黨代表向政府代表的陳述，以及共黨發言人答復外記者的詢問，在八月十四日「日本投降」以前，共軍也只佔八一縣城，如果共軍以其戰時所佔領的地區名爲「解放區』，則所謂「解放區」也不過這八十一縣城。日本投降以後，日軍及僞軍均向政府投降，聽候國軍繳除武裝，抗戰軍事終止，然而在十月中的時候，共黨代表向政府代表所聲明的，以及新華日報所公開宣傳的，則謂其「解放區」已有三百餘縣城，試問這多出來的二百餘縣城，是如何得來的呢？是不是在敵偽已經投降以後，不顧人民痛苦，用暴力攻擊國軍已收復區域而奪取的呢！或是進攻已經投降的僞軍而得來的呢？這可不待答復，而明白了。而且在兩個月期間以內，他的所謂「解放區」增加了二百多個縣，差不多每天要攻佔三個縣城，則共軍進攻的猛烈，更是不言可知了。然而新華社及新華日報在此期間中，却天天登載國軍命令敵僞軍隊攻擊共軍，這恰恰證明前面所說的共黨宣傳策略，一面自己實行攻擊，以擴充其地盤，一面却誣衊政府，說政府之使敵偽攻他，甚至說國軍向他進攻，這也可以證明共黨所稱的「解放區」，實只是他們的「侵佔區』，「割據區」而已。再說共黨所說國軍攻擊共軍的事實，自日本投降以後，衝突發生較大的地點，只有五處，（一）共黨所稱閻長官錫山，在九月攻擊上黨區域事件，這個區域包括長子。長治。屯留等縣，在日本投降以前，是由敵軍佔領的，日本投降後，國軍八月十九日妝復長子，八月廿一日收復長治及屯留，可是共軍大舉攻擊，九月十日攻陷屯留，九月十二日攻陷長子，十月十二日攻陷長治，只將雙方時間對照，就知是誰攻擊誰了。（二）共黨所擴大宣傳的馬法五，高樹勛事件，馬高部隊係奉命開往平津，接受敵軍投降，十月八日路經河北磁縣，突受共軍襲擊，該部隊以事出意外，部隊未曾集中，以致馬法五及高樹助均被俘，這顯明是共黨製擊國軍，阻撓受降，共黨沒有辦法辯白逍種事實，只好濫造謠言，謂馬高等受命剿共。馬高等已失去身體自由，自然可以隨便由共黨製造謠言了。（三）歸綏及（四）包頭被圍事件，歸綏及包頭兩地被圍兩月，人民所受之苦，比敵人佔領時尙多幾倍，而最奇怪的是，新華社及新華日報除謾駡傳長官作義外，對於兩地衝突隻字不提。（五）山海關一帶，阻擾國軍進　　入東北事件，國軍開入東北，恢復國家領土，這是天經地義，東北一帶，在日本控制的僞滿時代，共黨在那邊沒有一點活動，也是盡人皆知的事實，日本投降以後，淪陷已久的東北同胞，渴望重見天日，稍有民族意識的人，絕不會乘此時機，阻凝國軍恢復失土，然而共黨竟然開動軍隊，節節阻擾，這還有什麼說的呢，從這五件事平心靜氣的看，就可以知道共黨所向社會呼號的「內戰」，其眞相究竟如何了。</p>
<p>政府與共黨談判經過。</p>
<p>再就十月十日以後，政府與共黨的談判經過情形來講，會談紀要發表以後，大家都知道，有幾個實際問題，未得解決，其中（一）是政治協商會議，會談紀要內說明「雙方與各方洽商政治協商會議名額。組織及職權等項問題，雙方同意一俟洽商完畢，政治協商會議，即應迅速召開」，實際上名額組織及職權等問題，十月底均經各方商洽同意，政府本定十一月初即召開，但是因爲共黨延不指定代表，以致遲延至今。（二）是軍事小組問題，會談紀要內說明，關於共軍「駐地問題，可由中共方面提出方案，討論決定」，並「爲具體計劃本項所述各問題起見，雙方同意組織三人小組，軍令都，軍政部及第十八集團軍，各派一人進行之」，這是根本解決衝突的辦法。共軍駐地一經商定，則衡突自可以避免，但是共黨始終沒有依照會談紀要提出方案商討，而十八集團軍代表至今尙無來渝的消息，以致軍事小組無法進行，在此時間，政府正在盡力進行復員，並繼續談商，而共黨大肆破壞交通，使復員工作不能推進，人民不能回鄕，十月廿六日，政府代表向共黨代表出提三點：（一）鐵路交通必須恢復，（二）「中共軍隊撤退鐵路綫以外，其已佔領之區域，暫維現狀」（三）中共軍事代表葉劍英，應請早日來渝，進行軍事小組會議，商談中共軍隊整編及駐地問題，中共代表將此三點電達延安請示，廿九日共黨答覆：爲堅決避免內戰，迅速恢復交通起見，中共方面提鐵，（一）甲，停止進兵，進攻，進佔，乙，停止利用敵僞，丙，在八條鐵路綫（平綏，同蒲，正太，平漢北段，隴海東段，津浦，膠濟，北寗西段）上，雙方均不駐兵。丁，政府方面如須向平津靑島運兵，須經過協商。（二）軍事小組祗能在上述問題之原則決定後，方得擬具具體辦法，否則無權解決此事。（三）如萬一問題不能於事先取得協議，中共方而不反對先開政治協商會議，但開會時，必須先行解決避免內戰，恢復交通問題。十月卅一日，政府以最大容忍的態度，提出答覆六點：（一）雙方下令所嚴部隊，暫各駐守原地，不得對他方進攻。（二）中共在各鐵路綫之部隊，移駐鐵路綫十公里以外，中共對此等移撤地點，除由路局警察維持鐵路秩序外，不另派兵駐守。（三）由國民參政會組織交通視察團，推派參政員會同常地公正人士，赴各鐵路綫檢查，隨時將事實眞相提出報吿。（四）中央軍隊如在平綏，同蒲，正太，膠濟，平漢北段，隴海東段，津浦北段各鐵路綫有運輸之必要時，共同協商決定之。（五）雙方當儘一　　個月內，對中共軍隊駐兵地區及其整編等事，商定根本辦法，以利和平建設。（六）政治協商會議，仍照原定計劃，立即召開。</p>
<p>誰在容忍誰又在進逼</p>
<p>中共方面復電延安請示，直到十一月八日，始得到答覆，他們的答覆，對於政府所提各項辦法，完全不提，特別是政府提示雙方命令其軍隊停止任何進攻，而共黨的答案，只是單方面的說法，答案共四點如下：（一）軍事委員會下令國軍全面停止向解放區進攻。（二）國軍從進佔區全部撤退。（三）國軍從八條鐵路綫撤退。（四）政府取消各地剿匪命令，保證以後再不進攻各解放區。我們不要多說，只將兩方提案比照，誰在容忍，誰在進逼，誰在眞心想謀和平，誰在蓄意製造分裂，就可以一目了然了。政府需要和平建國，人民需要重返家鄕，安居樂業，所以雖在共黨於十一月八日提出那種單方面的哀的美敦書式的條件以後，政府還是容忍，主張將恢復交通避免衝突事件，提出政治協商會議討論。目下國際國內的情勢，均不容許我們再有內亂，我們最需要的是以眞誠團結的精神，來求事實上合理的解決，最應該避免的，是顚倒是非，不合事實的宣傳，政府深切期望政治協商會議從速召開，軍事小組趕即成立，盼望共黨能以事實來證明其眞心企求和平統一的誠意，而不再以宣傳混淆國內人士之聽聞。</p>

<h3>社論　對中國蠶絲公司的期望</h3>
<p>行政院於本月十一日例會決議設立中國蠶絲公司。其公司章程，昨日本報亦已披露，全文計二十三條。第二條規定資本來源，除政府所接收的江浙皖三省敵偽蠶絲資產而外，由經濟農林兩部再加一次撥足五億元。第五條規定營業年限爲二年，必要時得延長一年爲限。第廿一條規定盈餘分配中的官利及純益一槪解繳國庫。即此可以看出該公司是定有年限（至多三年）的國營企業性質。而它的營業範圍，則爲　桑之飼育栽培，絲繭之繅製，天然絲之加工紡織，成品之運銷，種絲事業之學術研究，民營蠶絲事業之輔導獎勵等等，均規定於章程的第四條，更可見其所負使命，不但與蠶絲有關，且兼及於綢業，不但爲國營事業，且兼及於民營蠶絲事業之輔導獎勵。况政府定其營業年限爲至多三年，則顯然表示將來仍將歸還於民營，而目前的若干統制乃是權宜之計。</p>
<p>中國目前經營蠶絲事業，不能不多少帶點統制性，乃是事勢所必然。一則江浙皖各地蠶絲機構，俱由中央主管部，派員接收，統盤籌劃，自較順理成章；二則今後出口貿易，無疑地，還是推蠶絲爲大宗，國家經營更易推進。敵寇用兵八年，他國內的育　事業，與繅絲織綢專業，犧牲最多，短期內，確實不易恢復。因此，無論從本國農民的副產業上着想，或是從國外貿易上着想，俱有統盤籌劃，急起直追的必要。不一定僅爲把握外匯，調整國際的收支平衡起見，纔如此辦理的。</p>
<p>這個中國總絲公司成立以後，我們期望先辦到下列幾點：</p>
<p>一　出口方面　生絲一項，雖是否國出口的大宗，可是通商以來，一直到戰前，這種貿易的大權，完全操在洋商手裏，這是無可諱言的。中國絲商，因爲種種關係，大都祗能仰承鼻息，得到一點洋商的餘瀝。至於眞正的蠶絲出口事業，我們自己能直接經營的，到如今，還不多見。這個公司，旣然由政府撥款，完全國營，他的力量，設備，人員，和種種連絡方面，自然遠在私人的民營事業之上。所以推行直接的主動的出口貿易，當然是可能，而且也必須要辦到的。</p>
<p>二　繅絲事業　新式的繅絲工業，雖然已有數十年的歷史，可是陳陳相因，多半已是落伍。何况在敵寇多年的掠奪侵佔以後，迎這種落伍的設備，也多已殘缺不全，或竟盪然無存。如果要積極補充，努力恢復起來，除掉由國家出來擔荷·至少，在短期間，恐怕未必容易。</p>
<p>三　改良蠶桑　過去對於改良　桑這件事，私人或半官的團體，都盡過不少的力氣，而且也已收到過相當的效果。就是官廳方面，也未嘗無相當的設施。可是範圍太狹，規模太小，人才和經費又太寡薄了，滄海一粟，功效究竟有限。這個中國蠶絲公司，名義上，雖說是個公司，多少總脫不了營利的意義。但設立的究是政府，不是商民。那麼，我們極希望他一面營利，一面能配合各地的主管行政機構，在根本上多下些培養和敎育的工夫。就是在蠶絲事業的學術研究，和民營蠶絲事業的輔導獎勵，要積極地，廣泛地，照章程所規定，切實辦到，中國蠶桑絲綢方眞有改良之望。</p>
<p>四　採購絲繭談到統制，總脫不了統收統購這些手段。這件工作，在戰前，已局部地試騐過，而抗戰期間，在淪陷區域，敵僞尤其生呑活剝，給予農民以不可遺忘的痛苦。所以在這一方面，我們希望，要有合理的措置，人之謀利，猶水之就下。只要有利可圖，人民自然樂從。就是要改良，要科學化，要實行種種新式的方法，也並非很困難的事。否則空言獎勵保護，在人民得不到實惠，暗地裏只感到苦痛與剝削，怎能引起他們的興趣呢？</p>
<p>因爲日寇的蠶絲事業　落了，起而代之的，只有我們中國。我們是如此期望着，就是盟邦也是如此期望着。這個中國蠶絲公司，顯然握着這個扶衰救弊的樞紐。當仁不讓，是所期望於中國蠶絲公司。</p>

<h3>蠶絲公司　主持人內定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕繼行政院通過「中國蠶絲公司章程」後，負責方面即積極籌劃公司之創設事宜，微聞農林部周部畏詒春，有被任爲該公司董事長之希望，總經理一職，傳以葛敬巾呼聲最高。聞葛氏業於一週前蒞滬，現正積極視察籌劃中，一俟該公司　監會成立，管理人選定奪，即將於上海設立總公司。據估計：江浙皖三省敵僞蠶絲資產經接收者，已達百分之九十以上，除將其估價抵充該公司資本總額之一部份外，復將由經農兩部一次另撥五億元，以充資力，故該公司將爲國內唯一之大規模蠶絲公司。</p>

<h3>社會服務　中美健兒角逐　萬人空巷觀球賽</h3>
<p>觀摩球藝·機會難得　嘉惠淸寒·助學第一</p>
<p>今晚七時，中美兩國健兒作籃球競賽於中華運動塲，事先早已森動海上，一般球迷，望眼欲穿。到那時爭先恐後，將有萬人空巷的情景。這番球賽的動機，完全爲徵募助學金，救濟淸寒學子，使他們能繼續上學，力求上進，完成他們的學業，這意義是非常深遠的。所以熱心人士，無不盡力贊助，節約無謂的浪費，買幾張榮譽券或是普通券，偕同兄弟姊妹，或親戚故舊，欣賞精彩百出的球藝，兩國健兒的勇氣，是多麼興奮愉快，間接濟助失學靑年的苦痛，心理上又是多麼的安慰；我率勸諸君：對此含有積極性的偉大養舉，理當竭力推動，竭力介紹！</p>

<h3>表哥來重慶</h3>
<p>— 梅幼雲</p>
<p>當由重慶東下的第一條輪船回來時，帶來了多年米見面的表哥。他輕鬆而偷快地來到了這山城。在這小屋裏，我們高興地聽他訴說着上海的種種。他吿訴我們，這一次由上海到重慶是一段多麼愜心的旅行。上海到南京的火車是那麼快，南京到重慶的論船是那麼好。旅客又是那麼少。引得我的心從腔子裏飛出去，到了上海又回到了重慶。來回的飛着。又輕鬆，又愉快。</p>
<p>他吿訴我是來重慶拿行李的。買好船票馬上回上海。頂多不過躭擱幾天。所以同一位同來的友人住在六千元一天的勝利大厦。</p>
<p>過了半個多月，在街上又碰見了表哥，他匆匆地招呼我，臉上有了些焦急的樣子。他吿訴我船票不好買。勝利大厦的房錢是越住越加的，他已搬入了時代旅舍。正在至處奔走，想買船票。</p>
<p>又過了二十幾天，表哥又出現在我們這小屋裏了。他已經成了焦急得不耐煩的樣子。他說船票眞不好找。一個多月的奔忙，才找到了點『路子』，要他出二十五萬元的『票價』去冒充一個煤炭間的工人，拿着鏟子去『上煤』。錢他寗肯出，可是『煤』他却不會『上』，這條路子只好『吹了』。</p>
<p>幾天之後，他半夜裏跑來，送了我些洋書，他說不好帶。留給我看吧。問他有了『路子』沒有？他說有了。要他出二十萬塊錢去冒充一個水手的兒子。明天便要去認這位冒充的父親。演塲戲吧！祇要能回去。</p>
<p>可是一直等了一個月，還有接着表哥回到上海的來信。準是冒充兒子的『路子』又『吹了』</p>
<p>昨天才得着表哥自宜昌來的信，他說是到了宜昌。還得另找『路子』。</p>
<p>我拿着這封信，回憶他初到重慶時的那輕鬆愉快的情形！</p>

<h3>研究墨索里尼的腦子</h3>
<p>— 柏華</p>
<p>美國軍醫在顯微鏡底下，檢騐墨索里尼的腦組織，給果並沒有發現任何徵象，足以說明這位法西斯主義的梟首何以會這樣狂暴。</p>
<p>美國陸軍醫學博物院的指導員埃希上校說，該博物院收到墨氏兩塊前臘。目前對於這兩塊前腦的研究還沒有澈底完成，就現在所獲的成績來說，墨氏的腦子沒有任何病症或構造上的缺陷。</p>
<p>不過，美國國立的聖伊利莎伯精神病院監督奧郝涉博士認爲，墨氏的學沒有生理或構造上的缺陷，但這並不能斷定他沒有精神病。</p>
<p>奧郝涉博士說，「腦生理上的缺陷往往是精神病的起因；但是，精神病患者並不一定有顯著的腦缺陷。除了腦生理的情形以外，還有其他的因素足以影響一個人的行為。譬如，生活環境，身體的化學機構——特別是腎上腺的活動，都能够影響人的腦子以至人的行爲。』</p>
<p>埃希上校說：『你不能靠顯微鏡檢查腦十，來斷定他是一個天才，或是一個平常的人。顯微鏡所能見到的僅是嚴重的腦構浩缺陷，如智力薄弱之類，墨索里尼顯然不是一個智力薄弱的人。』</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3>事業觀念</h3>
<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>我國各種事業，至今還是脆弱得很，『人事不臧』，當然是主因之一，但是鈎心鬥角於私利者太多，競爭於正常進步者太少，也是實在情形。因此，名不符實的人物，以及暴發非義之財的充斥於社會，而眞正於事業有成就，能够『福國利民』的實屬僅見。</p>
<p>其實，人的評價，不能以財富和地位而論，而是在於事業的意義和貢獻方面。抗戰雖已完成，建國工作尙在開端，如果現在的靑年對於這一層還是認織錯誤，那末國家前途，還是不堪設想的。所以現在每個靑年，必須抱定自己的事業觀念，負起建國的重任，實在是非常重要的事。國父說：『以我人數十年必死之精神，締造億萬年不朽之基礎』，就是指示靑年要確立事業觀念，而努力創造，雖然不朽之事業，非人人可成，但是事業不論大小，總以有助於人類福利方面者盡心力爲之。所謂『學以致用』，把所學的東西，用之於有意義的工作，才是靑年的正確齣事業觀念。</p>
<p>雖然當前的一切，距離理想太遠，不免令人失望，但是要知道大戰方終，一切秩序未復，還須經過短期的患難，這也是意料中事，祇要全國上下努力去克服患難，這個患難時期是容易縮短的。認淸了這一點，實在不必失望頹唐，而應更加振作邁進。抱定事業觀念爲建國大業而努力。</p>
<p>一個人經過嶽難的時期，是不足爲慮的，如果終其生，對事業沒有成就，對社會國家不能克盡厥職，那眞是還憾無窮。所以孟子說：『君子有終身之憂，無一朝之患』。這句話確是至理，我們應得三復斯言。</p>

<h3>敵人（The　Enemy）　（十八）</h3>
<p>— 賽珍著　朱綺譯</p>
<p>『你是說那人逃走了嗎？』將軍無力地問。一星期前，他已施過手術，那晚貞雄是給呌去施急救手術的。貞雄有二十四小時不能確定將軍能不能活着。病已延及膽囊很多了。後來那老人又開始深深地呼吸，要吃東西了。貞雄不能問起暗殺的事。照他所知，他們從沒有來過。傭人們都已回來，弓子已將客房澈底打掃過，還在裏面用硫黃薰過，薰掉那白種人的氣味。沒有八說過什麼。發脾氣的祗有那園丁，因爲菊花的季節已經過去了。</p>
<p>可是一星期以後，貞雄覺得將軍已經好了一點，可以對他講講那俘虜的事了。</p>
<p>貞雄現在是在說：『是的，大人，他逃走了。』他咳嗽一聲，表示他還沒有說完他所要說的話，可是不願再打擾將軍了。可是那老人忽然睜開眼睛，看住了他。</p>
<p>他用力地說：『那俘虜，我不是答應過你，我會替你將他殺掉的嗎？』</p>
<p>貞雄說：『你說過的，大人。』</p>
<p>老人驚異地說：『是了，我是這樣說過的。可是你知道，我病得厲害。不瞞你說，我除了自己以外，沒有想到旁的。簡單些說，我忘記了對答應你的事。』</p>
<p>貞雄喃喃地說：『我也在奇怪，大人。』</p>
<p>將軍說：『這齣確是我太疏忽了。不過你也知道這並不是不愛國或是怠慢職務。』他焦急地看着他的醫生。『如果這事洩露出來的話，你能了解這一點嗎？』</p>
<p>貞雄說：『是的，大人。』他忽然覺悟將軍在他的掌握之中，弄到結果，他倒是安全的。他對將軍說：『我可以爲你的忠心與反抗敵人的熱誠保證。』</p>
<p>將軍喃喃道：『你是個好人，你可以得到酬。』他閉上了眼睛。</p>

<p>外幣</p>
<p>美鈔初以出金套買者繼續見殷，市況堅俏，以致步漲至一三一〇元以上，外商貿易公司以及大戶逢高猛力削價傾售，籌碼鬆動，立見回降，午刻在一二六〇元左右徘徊，午後一度隨金價而重俏，迨後金市變色，錢兌莊方面實貨紛紛爭售，突回跌至一二〇〇元大關，結果較前收仍漲五十餘元，對黃金套價自六二〇元對十兩緊縮至五八〇元，最後約六〇〇元弱，一般心理重鈔輕金之觀念殊為明顯，受差等匯率之影響也，港幣初堅後疲，老貨曾漲至二四〇元以上，新貨曾逼近七〇元，結果則均與前日相彷彿。</p>
<p>證券　公債昨呈盤局，熱門平平，雜牌稍跌，結果較前收微挫五元至十五元。華股隨金市而見漲，逢高散多鴻出，以致美亞自三〇五元高價回降後，未能重出大關，結果較前收雖漲，計紗廠四十元，美亞二十元，景福二元，勤興新光各一元半，已較本日高價低半成，而收後續形微挫。外股亦不脫盤局，怡紗怡啤紙業三熱稍漲，其餘冷門照收價低一成，有人垂靑。</p>
<p>米糧　昨日米市以內地產價步昂，成本居高，因之白粳秈均漲四五百元，薄早稻北帮略有去化，價漲六七百元，白元亦漲六七百元，生油來源尚多，價升三五百元，豆油供不應求，價升千元，麵粉亦加一二百元，黃豆來貨稀小，求過於供，高料升四五百，中下者亦升二三百元，生仁銷路轉活，價升千元，豆餅亦隨之上升百餘元，惟酒市則依然平庸。</p>
<p>紗市　晨開過高，較昨喊大四五萬，旋以賣戶麕集，行市一路下傾，如十六支光明紗自三十五萬直瀉至三十二萬，略有成交，二十支及三十二支細紗買戶稀少，然廠號售意頗殷，價雖高而成交寥寥，收盤行市雖較上日高一二萬，然走勢似已脆弱，人心亦平常之至。</p>

<h3>Tea Party of Beiping Party, Government, and Military Officials: Chairman Chiang Instructs Leaders to Uphold the New Life Movement and Build a New Beiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] Chairman Chiang convened a tea party for responsible personnel from Beiping's Party, government, and military circles at Huai Ren Hall on the 14th, attended by over 350 people. The Chairman arrived at 3:50 PM, appearing radiant in military uniform and sword. Upon entering, all attendees stood and applauded. The Chairman delivered an impromptu speech, stating briefly: "The victory of this War of Resistance was the result of the heroic sacrifices and struggles of the nation's military and civilians for fourteen years since the September 18th Incident. Responsible comrades from all sectors should reflect on the heroic sacrifices of the martyrs, seize this opportunity of victory, strive unremittingly, take responsibility autonomously, concentrate our strength, and cooperate with each other to ultimately fulfill our mission of nation-building." The Chairman then pointed out the urgent tasks for all sectors going forward, saying that Party affairs personnel should practically devote themselves to local self-government, lead the people, exercise the four powers, to realize the Principle of Democracy; political and economic personnel should devote themselves to stabilizing people's livelihoods and raising the people's living standards, to achieve the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The military is the guarantee of the country and the nation. After the victory of the War of Resistance, it should especially abide by discipline, cherish the people, and promote the glorious tradition of the national army. The Chairman finally explained that Beiping is our country's former capital and one of our country's most magnificent cities. The current city appearance and order have greatly declined. Now, after its recovery, it is hoped that Party, government, and military circles, and all our city compatriots, can vigorously implement the regulations of the New Life Movement to create a vigorous new Beiping and serve as a model for all cities in the country.</p>

<h3>Heavy Snow in Changchun Disrupts Air Transport; Citizens Bravely Endure Severe Cold and Eagerly Await All Day</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The former Yushan Radio Station broadcasted that, according to reliable sources, the Chinese army has crossed 30 miles beyond Shenyang and is currently advancing towards Harbin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Liu Zhuzhou, Changchun, 13th] The northwest wind was strong last night, and this morning the ground was covered with about an inch of snow, with the temperature dropping to minus 14 degrees Celsius. The general public here is extremely concerned about the recent weather and eagerly hopes that our air transport fleet can fly in formation across the clear sky. Several large buildings suitable for setting up camps here have been cleaned and prepared, awaiting the arrival of the National Army. It is heard that after the arrival of the National Army, local security will still be the responsibility of the Soviet army until its complete withdrawal. Also, the Public Security Bureau has now been renamed the Police Bureau and is directly under the Municipal Government. The Cultural and Educational Section of the Municipal Government has also been reorganized into the Education Bureau.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] According to news from Changchun: The entire population of the city, braving the extremely cold weather, waited all day on Thursday for the arrival of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Authoritative sources in the Chinese military circles today believe that the news reports that the National Army has arrived in Shenyang or has been airlifted to Changchun are still "premature." The source pointed out that the airlift of the National Army to the Northeast is limited to Changchun alone, and this work has been delayed due to the severe cold and heavy snow. The first batch of troops to be airlifted to Changchun will be the 5th Division of the 94th Army, which is currently still in Beiping. The occupation of Shenyang, with Soviet approval, will be undertaken by troops of the 13th Army and the 52nd Army, which are advancing towards Shenyang by land.</p>
<h3>Factories Resuming Operations; Prices Have Not Fallen</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Factories here related to daily life have now resumed operations one after another. As of now, the number of food factories that have resumed operations using existing equipment has reached 30, along with 16 sauce shops, 6 wineries, over 100 newly opened tofu factories, and over 50 pickled vegetable businesses. As for other major factories, due to the lack of coal, only one in ten has resumed operations. Most government agencies and companies with heating equipment have switched to using stoves to save coal. All schools, lacking coal for heating, have scheduled an early winter vacation starting on the 15th. Currently, the workers employed by the Xing Yuan are mostly poor students from various middle schools. They are all diligent and eager to learn, and consider it an honor to serve here. Various prices, after falling at the time of Japan's surrender, have gradually risen and are now almost the same as before Japan's surrender. The prices of staple foods are: white rice, 5 yuan per catty; flour, 7 yuan; sorghum, 1.5 yuan; millet, 3 yuan; soybeans, 8 jiao; mung beans, 2.5 yuan; sesame seed cakes, 2 yuan each; steamed buns, 1 yuan; dumplings, 5 jiao.

<h3>Political Consultative Conference Expected to be Held Next Week</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 14th] The Political Consultative Conference, if not further obstructed, will be held within the next week. Its urgent task is to consider all outstanding issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and find ways to stop the current internal strife. Observers in the government believe that the National Government seems likely to maintain its previous proposal, requiring the Communist army to withdraw ten kilometers on both sides of the railway lines. The Communist Party seems likely to insist first, that the National Army must withdraw in the same way; and second, that any actions by the National Army on these lines must be approved by the Communist Party. The voting procedure issue also needs to be resolved, as both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are unwilling to be in a position of minority obeying the majority. Therefore, obstacles may arise from the very beginning of the meeting.</p>

<h3>US Planes to Continue Aerial Demonstration; Bodies of Seven Missing Pilots Recovered</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beiping, 14th] Major General Locke, commander of the 3rd Amphibious Corps of the US Marine Corps, stated today while hosting journalists: "Last Saturday, six US Marine Corps planes crashed in the mountains during a formation flight.

<h3>Marshall Concludes Testimony; May Arrive in China Next Week; Hurley to Return to His Legal Career</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] General Marshall, the newly appointed US Ambassador to China and former Chief of Staff of the Army, has concluded his testimony before the Pearl Harbor Disaster Investigation Committee today after seven consecutive days. Marshall admitted that on December 7, 1941, he could have notified Hawaii by phone to implement precautions without revealing the secret of intercepting Japanese encrypted messages. However, Vice Admiral Short, commander of the US military in Hawaii, received a warning, it was after the Japanese attack. When Marshall attended the committee, a plane was waiting at the airport, ready to carry Marshall to China to assume his new post, so after speaking, he left hastily amidst applause.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] Today's editorial in "The Washington Post" stated: "General Marshall, President Truman's special envoy to China, has the same main task as his predecessor, General Hurley, which is to encourage the Chinese central government to move towards liberalization. The Chinese problem is second in importance only to the atomic bomb at the upcoming Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference. The consistency of US-Soviet policy toward China is our greatest concern. At present, both countries recognize the Chongqing central government as the sole government, but the overall situation in China is not stable and can change at any time, so our policy must be able to adapt to constantly changing facts in order to deal with it comfortably."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] According to the US News Service Washington on the 13th, according to the US News Agency, Hurley will soon return to his legal career. Hurley was ill yesterday. According to his close friends, Hurley welcomes the conclusion of the report hearing, and he believes that the result of this hearing will produce a "great clarification" of US policy towards China, which has already achieved good results in the Far East. Referring to Marshal's appointment as a special envoy to China, Hurley said: The US statement of policy toward China "makes it certain for my successor to succeed." According to Hurley's opinion, all aspects of foreign policy should be regularly announced to the people, since it is the people who ultimately create or abolish foreign policy. Hurley's return to his legal career ends his five years of service in the US military and the State Department.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] Today's "Sunday News" magazine reported that Wallace has been President Truman's regular adviser since the "Hurley incident." According to the magazine, Wallace was the first to try to reconcile the Chinese Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Government Spokesperson Details Facts, Hopes Communist Party Will Not Engage in Confusing Propaganda</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] A reporter from this agency, noting that the New China News Agency and the New China Daily frequently report on the National Army attacking "Liberated Areas" and put forward the slogan "Oppose Civil War" to expand their propaganda, specifically asked the government spokesperson for their opinion. The government spokesperson replied that the consistent propaganda strategy of the Communist Party is to do whatever it wants to do itself, knowing that it is not permitted by public reason, and then, while actually carrying out its plan, it simultaneously engages in large-scale propaganda saying that the other side is doing exactly that, in order to shift the focus, shirk responsibility, and conceal its own intentions and actions. The reports from the New China News Agency and the New China Daily should be viewed in this light. In fact, one only needs to conduct a completely objective investigation from the perspective of propaganda to know that their so-called National Army attacking "Liberated Areas" is actually the Communist Army obstructing the National Army's surrender acceptance. The "civil war" they are propagating against is actually the internal unrest manufactured by the Communist Party itself. This can be proven by the various facts of the Communist Party expanding its territory by force after the Japanese surrender and the government and Communist Party representatives continuing to discuss matters after the publication of the October 10th government-Communist Party representative meeting minutes.</p>
<p>"Liberation" is actually "Separatism"</p>
<p>According to the "Map of the Situation of the Anti-Japanese War Behind Enemy Lines in China" self-made by the "Yan'an Headquarters" at the end of June this year, the Communist Party occupied only 69 county seats nationwide, including the so-called "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region," which included counties such as Yan'an. According to the Communist Party representatives' statements to the government representatives and the Communist Party spokesperson's answers to foreign reporters' questions, before August 14, the "Japanese surrender," the Communist Army only occupied 81 county seats. If the Communist Army calls the areas it occupied during the war "Liberated Areas," then the so-called "Liberated Areas" are only these 81 county seats. After the Japanese surrender, the Japanese and puppet troops all surrendered to the government, awaiting the National Army to disarm them. The anti-Japanese military operations ended. However, in mid-October, the Communist Party representatives stated to the government representatives, and the New China Daily publicly proclaimed, that their "Liberated Areas" already had over 300 county seats. So, how did these extra 200+ county seats come about? Was it after the enemy and puppet troops had already surrendered, disregarding the suffering of the people, using violence to attack the areas recovered by the National Army and seize them? Or was it by attacking the already surrendered puppet troops? This does not need a reply, it is already clear. Moreover, within a period of two months, their so-called "Liberated Areas" increased by more than 200 counties, almost occupying three county seats every day. The intensity of the Communist Army's attacks is self-evident. However, during this period, the New China News Agency and the New China Daily daily published reports of the National Army ordering the enemy and puppet troops to attack the Communist Army. This precisely proves the Communist Party's propaganda strategy mentioned earlier: on one hand, they themselves carry out attacks to expand their territory; on the other hand, they slander the government, saying that the government is using the enemy and puppet troops to attack them, even saying that the National Army is attacking them. This can also prove that the "Liberated Areas" claimed by the Communist Party are actually only their "occupied areas," "separated areas." Furthermore, regarding the Communist Party's claim that the National Army attacked the Communist Army, since the Japanese surrender, there have only been five locations where relatively large conflicts occurred: (1) The incident that the Communist Party claimed was Governor Yan Xishan attacking the Shangdang area in September. This area included Changzi, Changzhi, Tunliu, and other counties, which were occupied by the enemy forces before the Japanese surrender. After the Japanese surrender, the National Army recovered Changzi on August 19, recovered Changzhi and Tunliu on August 21, but the Communist Army launched a large-scale attack, capturing Tunliu on September 10, capturing Changzi on September 12, and capturing Changzhi on October 12. Simply comparing the timelines of both sides, one can know who attacked whom. (2) The Ma Fuwu and Gao Shuxun incident that the Communist Party has greatly publicized. The Ma and Gao troops were ordered to go to Tianjin and Beijing to accept the surrender of the enemy forces. On October 8, while passing through Cixian County in Hebei, they were suddenly attacked by the Communist Army. Because the incident was unexpected and the troops were not concentrated, Ma Fuwu and Gao Shuxun were both captured. This clearly shows that the Communist Party attacked the National Army and obstructed the surrender acceptance. The Communist Party has no way to defend against such facts, so they can only fabricate rumors, saying that Ma and Gao were ordered to suppress the Communists. Ma and Gao have already lost their freedom, so naturally the Communist Party can fabricate rumors at will. (3) The siege of Guihua and (4) Baotou. Guihua and Baotou were besieged for two months, and the suffering of the people was several times greater than when the enemy occupied them. What is most strange is that the New China News Agency and the New China Daily, aside from scolding Governor Fu Zuoyi, did not mention a word about the conflicts in the two places. (5) The incident of obstructing the National Army from entering the Northeast around Shanhaiguan. The National Army entering the Northeast to recover national territory is a matter of course. The fact that the Communist Party had no activity there during the puppet Manchukuo era under Japanese control in the Northeast is also a well-known fact. After the Japanese surrender, the compatriots in the long-occupied Northeast eagerly hoped to see the light of day again. Anyone with a bit of national consciousness would never take this opportunity to obstruct the National Army from recovering lost territory. However, the Communist Party actually mobilized troops to obstruct them at every step. What else is there to say? Looking at these five incidents calmly, one can know what the truth of the "civil war" that the Communist Party is calling out to society is.</p>
<p>The Government's Negotiations with the Communist Party</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the progress of the government's negotiations with the Communist Party after October 10, everyone knows that there are several practical problems that have not been resolved after the publication of the meeting minutes. Among them, (1) is the Political Consultative Conference. The meeting minutes stated that "Both sides will consult with all parties on the number of seats, organization, and powers of the Political Consultative Conference. Both sides agreed that the Political Consultative Conference should be convened quickly as soon as the consultations are completed." In reality, the issues of the number of seats, organization, and powers were all agreed upon by all parties at the end of October. The government originally planned to convene it in early November, but it has been delayed until now because the Communist Party has delayed in designating representatives. (2) is the Military Subcommittee. The meeting minutes stated that regarding the "issue of the Communist Army's garrison locations, the Communist Party can propose a plan for discussion and decision," and "to specifically plan for each issue mentioned above, both sides agreed to organize a three-person subcommittee, with the Military Command Department, the Ministry of Military Administration, and the 18th Group Army each sending one person to carry it out." This is a fundamental solution to the conflict. Once the Communist Army's garrison locations are agreed upon, then conflicts can naturally be avoided. However, the Communist Party has never proposed a plan for discussion according to the meeting minutes, and there is still no news of the 18th Group Army representative coming to Chongqing, so the Military Subcommittee cannot proceed. During this time, the government is doing its best to carry out demobilization and continue negotiations, while the Communist Party is vigorously destroying transportation, preventing the demobilization work from progressing and preventing the people from returning home. On October 26, the government representatives presented three points to the Communist Party representatives: (1) Railway transportation must be restored. (2) "The Communist Party's army must withdraw beyond the railway lines, and the areas it has already occupied will temporarily maintain the status quo." (3) The Communist Party's military representative, Ye Jianying, should be invited to come to Chongqing as soon as possible to hold a Military Subcommittee meeting to discuss the reorganization and garrison locations of the Communist Party's army. The Communist Party representatives telegraphed these three points to Yan'an for instructions. On the 29th, the Communist Party replied: In order to resolutely avoid civil war and quickly restore transportation, the Communist Party proposed three points regarding the railways: (1) A. Stop advancing troops, attacking, and occupying; B. Stop using enemy and puppet troops; C. On the eight railway lines (Ping-Sui, Tong-Pu, Zheng-Tai, the northern section of Ping-Han, the eastern section of Long-Hai, Jin-Pu, Jiao-Ji, and the western section of Bei-Ning), neither side will station troops. D. If the government side needs to transport troops to Tianjin and Qingdao, it must be done through consultation. (2) The Military Subcommittee can only formulate specific measures after the principles of the above-mentioned issues have been decided, otherwise it has no authority to resolve this matter. (3) If the issue cannot be agreed upon in advance, the Communist Party does not oppose first holding a Political Consultative Conference, but when the meeting is held, the issue of avoiding civil war and restoring transportation must be resolved first. On October 31, the government, with the greatest tolerance, proposed six points in response: (1) Both sides order their respective troops to temporarily garrison in their original locations and not attack the other side. (2) The Communist Party's troops on all railway lines will move to locations ten kilometers away from the railway lines. The Communist Party will not station troops at these relocation points, except for railway police maintaining railway order. (3) The National Political Consultative Council will organize a transportation inspection team, dispatching councilors to go to the railway lines to inspect the situation with local impartial individuals and submit reports on the true facts at any time. (4) If the Central Army needs to transport troops on the Ping-Sui, Tong-Pu, Zheng-Tai, Jiao-Ji, northern section of Ping-Han, eastern section of Long-Hai, and northern section of Jin-Pu railway lines, it will be decided through joint consultation. (5) Both sides should agree on fundamental measures regarding the Communist Party's troops' garrison areas and their reorganization within a month to facilitate peaceful reconstruction. (6) The Political Consultative Conference will still be convened immediately according to the original plan.</p>
<p>Who is Tolerating and Who is Pressing</p>
<p>The Communist Party telegraphed to Yan'an for instructions, and did not receive a reply until November 8. Their reply did not mention any of the measures proposed by the government. In particular, the government suggested that both sides order their armies to cease any attacks, but the Communist Party's answer was only a unilateral statement. The answer has four points as follows: (1) The Military Committee orders the National Army to completely stop attacking the Liberated Areas. (2) The National Army withdraws completely from the occupied areas. (3) The National Army withdraws from the eight railway lines. (4) The government cancels all bandit suppression orders in various places and guarantees that it will never attack the Liberated Areas again. We don't need to say much, just compare the proposals of both sides, and it will be clear at a glance who is tolerating, who is pressing, who sincerely wants to seek peace, and who is deliberately creating division. The government needs peaceful nation-building, and the people need to return to their hometowns and live and work in peace. Therefore, even after the Communist Party proposed those unilateral ultimatum-style conditions on November 8, the government still tolerated them and advocated that the issue of restoring transportation and avoiding conflicts be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference for discussion. The current international and domestic situation does not allow us to have internal strife again. What we need most is to seek a factual and reasonable solution with a spirit of sincere unity. What should be avoided most is propaganda that reverses right and wrong and is not in accordance with the facts. The government deeply hopes that the Political Consultative Conference will be convened as soon as possible and that the Military Subcommittee will be established quickly. We hope that the Communist Party can prove its sincerity in seeking peace and unity with facts and no longer confuse the hearing of domestic people with propaganda.</p>

<h3>Iran Again Sends Notes to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Demanding the Swift Withdrawal of Troops</h3>
<p>Hoping They Will Not Interfere With the Free Actions of the Iranian Army and Police</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 14th] The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a memorandum to the British, American, and Soviet embassies here yesterday, demanding that a decision be made quickly on the withdrawal of the three countries' troops from Iran, as the presence of foreign troops in Iran damages Iranian sovereignty and is enough to cause unfortunate incidents and increase the suffering of the people.

<h3>Editorial: Expectations for the China Silk Company</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan decided to establish the China Silk Company at its regular meeting on the 11th of this month. The company's articles of association, which were also disclosed in full in yesterday's newspaper, consist of twenty-three articles. Article 2 stipulates the source of capital. In addition to the enemy and puppet silk assets in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces received by the government, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will allocate an additional 500 million yuan in one lump sum. Article 5 stipulates that the business term is two years, which may be extended by one year if necessary. Article 21 stipulates that all official interest and net profits from the profit distribution will be turned over to the national treasury. From this, it can be seen that the company is a state-owned enterprise with a fixed term (up to three years). Its business scope, which includes the cultivation of mulberry trees, the reeling of silkworm cocoons, the processing and spinning of natural silk, the transportation and sales of finished products, the academic research of silkworm breeding, and the guidance and encouragement of private silk businesses, is stipulated in Article 4. This shows that its mission is not only related to silk but also to the silk industry. It is not only a state-owned enterprise but also involves the guidance and encouragement of private silk businesses. Moreover, the government has set its business term to a maximum of three years, which clearly indicates that it will eventually be returned to private operation, and the current control is only a temporary measure.</p>
<p>The current operation of the silk industry in China inevitably involves a degree of control, which is a necessary consequence of the situation. Firstly, the silk institutions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces are all managed by the central competent department, which sends personnel to take over and plan comprehensively, which is more logical. Secondly, for future export trade, silk will undoubtedly be the main product, and state operation is easier to promote. After eight years of aggression by the enemy, the silkworm breeding and silk reeling and weaving industries have suffered the most and will not be easily restored in the short term. Therefore, whether from the perspective of the farmers' side industry or from the perspective of foreign trade, there is a need for comprehensive planning and a rapid catch-up. This is not necessarily done solely to secure foreign exchange and adjust the balance of international payments.</p>
<p>After the establishment of this China Silk Company, we expect the following points to be achieved first:</p>
<p>1.  Exports: Although raw silk is a major export commodity, it is undeniable that the power of this trade has been entirely in the hands of foreign merchants since the beginning of trade until before the war. Chinese silk merchants, due to various reasons, can mostly only rely on the crumbs left by foreign merchants. As for the genuine silk export business that we can directly operate, it is still rare to see it today. This company, since it is funded by the government and is entirely state-owned, its strength, equipment, personnel, and various connections are naturally far superior to private businesses. Therefore, promoting direct and proactive export trade is certainly possible and must be done.</p>
<p>2.  Silk Reeling Industry: Although the modern silk reeling industry has a history of several decades, it has mostly become outdated due to stagnation. Moreover, after years of plunder and occupation by the enemy, even these outdated facilities have mostly been damaged or even completely destroyed. If we want to actively replenish and strive to restore them, it may not be easy, at least in the short term, without the state taking responsibility.</p>
<p>3.  Improvement of Sericulture: In the past, private or semi-official organizations have made considerable efforts to improve sericulture, and have achieved considerable results. Even the government has implemented corresponding measures. However, the scope is too narrow, the scale is too small, and the talent and funding are too scarce. Like a drop in the ocean, the effect is ultimately limited. Although this China Silk Company is nominally a company, it is somewhat inseparable from the meaning of profit. However, it is established by the government, not by merchants. Therefore, we sincerely hope that while making profits, it can also cooperate with local competent administrative agencies to fundamentally invest more effort in cultivation and education. It should also actively and extensively carry out academic research on sericulture and provide guidance and encouragement to private sericulture businesses, as stipulated in the articles of association, to ensure that China's sericulture and silk industry truly have hope for improvement.</p>
<p>4.  Procurement of Silkworm Cocoons: When it comes to control, it is always inseparable from the means of unified collection and purchase. This work was partially tested before the war, and during the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy and puppets in the occupied areas especially ruthlessly exploited the farmers, causing them unforgettable pain. Therefore, in this regard, we hope that there will be reasonable measures. People seek profit just as water flows downwards. As long as there is profit to be made, people will naturally be happy to comply. Even if we want to improve, to implement science, and to implement various new methods, it is not very difficult. Otherwise, if we only talk about encouragement and protection, and the people do not receive real benefits, and secretly only feel pain and exploitation, how can we arouse their interest?</p>
<p>Because the Japanese sericulture industry has declined, only we Chinese can replace it. We expect this, and the Allied countries also expect this. This China Silk Company clearly holds the key to supporting the weak and rescuing the ailing. It is expected that the China Silk Company will not shirk its responsibility.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Railway Transportation: Twenty New Locomotives Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Transportation Equipment Arrives Simultaneously</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The twenty locomotives shipped to China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou the day before yesterday afternoon. Officials stated that the purpose of shipping these locomotives to China is to help solve the difficulties in our railway transportation and to improve the convenience of passenger and freight transportation. It is also learned that UNRRA also has another batch of goods, including gasoline and engine oil, which are expected to arrive here in the near future. The China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration stated that once these materials arrive, part of them will be sold publicly to facilitate private use.</p>
<p>American ships "Flyer" and "Remington" arrived in port the day before yesterday from New York, carrying a large number of relief supplies and transportation vehicles, including more than six hundred jeeps and cargo trucks. It is reported that the American ship "Cape St. Thomas" will arrive in Shanghai today, loaded entirely with heavy cargo from the Relief and Production Bureau.

<h3>Foreign Nationals' Civil and Criminal Lawsuits: Courts Accept All</h3>

<h3>Municipal Government Plans to Establish Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Shihua told our newspaper reporter yesterday that the entire plan for building a new Shanghai is currently being studied in detail by various specialized personnel of the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government now intends to invite leaders and specialized talents from all sectors of the city to form a municipal advisory body to collect public opinions and jointly promote municipal administration. In the future, issues related to the construction of the city will be submitted to the advisory committee for advice. Under the joint cooperation of the government and the people, a new Shanghai will be built. Shanghai is an international city, and foreigners have made many contributions to the construction of the city in the past. After the advisory body is established in the future, it is also planned to invite foreign leaders to participate. At the beginning of the Municipal Government's arrival in Shanghai, it received instructions from the central government to divide the work into three stages: reception, consolidation, and construction. Currently, the reception work has come to an end, and the consolidation work has also reached a considerable stage. Measures are now being prepared for construction work. However, the city's finances have not yet been put on track, tax revenues are short, and administrative expenses are very high, requiring monthly subsidies from the central government. Therefore, large-scale construction plans need to be promoted after the financial situation improves. The Municipal Government is now making every effort to enrich the city's finances from all aspects so that it can achieve the goal of balancing revenue and expenditure in a short period of time, so that the plan to build a new Shanghai can be gradually promoted.</p>
<h3>China Silk Company: Key Personnel Appointed Internally</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the Executive Yuan's approval of the "Articles of Association of the China Silk Company," the responsible parties are actively planning the establishment of the company. It is rumored that Minister Zhou Yichun of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry hopes to be appointed as the chairman of the company's board of directors, and Ge Jingzhong is said to be the most likely candidate for the position of general manager. It is reported that Ge arrived in Shanghai a week ago and is currently actively inspecting and planning. Once the company's board of supervisors is established and the management personnel are selected, the head office will be established in Shanghai. It is estimated that more than 90% of the enemy and puppet silk assets in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have been received. In addition to valuing them to offset part of the company's total capital, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture will also allocate an additional 500 million yuan in one lump sum to increase capital. Therefore, the company will be the only large-scale silk company in the country.</p>
<p>Received Silk Factories Can Start Work Soon</p>
<p>Among the companies taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' China Silk Company in this city are the China Silk Company, the No. 1 and No. 2 Silk Factories in Zhabei, the No. 1 Silk Weaving Factory on Yanping Road in West Shanghai of the China Silk Company, and the No. 2 Silk Weaving Factory on Bailinan Road. It is rumored that the silk weaving factories will soon be preparing to start work, but the silk factories, because their original machinery is only suitable for weaving short staple fiber, still need to be planned for renovation.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Daily Necessities: Decision to Accelerate Sales at Low Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has decided to accelerate the sale at low prices of various daily necessities in sealed warehouses from today, including fabrics, cigarettes, soap, white sugar, and refrigerated fish and meat. A portion of liquid fuel will arrive in Shanghai within days, with a selling price of approximately 400 yuan per unit.</p>
<p>Low-Priced Flour Widely Available Today</p>
<p>The first phase of the UNRRA's low-priced flour sales is scheduled to be widely implemented starting today. The selling price is 1,900 yuan per bag (including the bag), weighing 44 city catties, equivalent to 40 yuan per city catty. There is no limit to the amount sold. All retailers selling flour will have the words "UNRRA Flour Retailer" on their doors.</p>
<p>Refrigerated Fish: Chemical Tests Before Resale</p>
<p>Because enemy goods have been stored in this city for a long time, whether they can be eaten is of great importance to the health of the citizens. The fish market has sent a letter to the Municipal Health Bureau, requesting that personnel be sent to the warehouses to take samples from four locations, divide them into two copies, and perform chemical tests separately. After it is proven that they are edible, they will be distributed for sale at low prices.</p>
<p>Mr. Ke Gaoda Explains the Situation</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Colonel Ke Gaoda, head of the Civil Affairs Group of the US Military Headquarters, especially hosted a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Construction Building at 4:00 PM yesterday on this matter, representing General Weidelin. He said that the current price list for wine, dishes, and snacks includes 40 items. These prices were determined based on a survey of 22 high-end restaurants in the city and jointly agreed upon by the US military, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Except for the 20% not collected by the Municipal Government, it includes all additional expenses. The restaurants or cafes that set these prices must have music and other entertainment facilities. Currently, there are 186 establishments in the city that hold permits to serve US military personnel, but they will be re-designated starting December 17. The purpose of the prices set is to ensure that US troops are not charged excessively high prices, not to attempt to control the prices of stores in the city. Therefore, the food prices for non-military personnel are still determined by each store and have nothing to do with the US military. If stores still use other methods to charge prices in the future, US military personnel can obtain invoices and menus and report them to the US military police captain, who will then prohibit US military personnel from going there.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Leases Seven Ships: Sailing on Chongming Lines</h3>

<p>Another report: The Minquan ship, coming from Chongqing, was slightly delayed in Nanjing and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai next Tuesday.

Yesterday, it returned to Shanghai from Qingdao, carrying only 400 tons of passengers and cargo, mostly chemicals such as carbonic acid and calcium. It is scheduled to continue sailing to Qingdao tomorrow, without loading passengers or cargo, solely for official use.</p>

<h3>Crackdown on Unlicensed Vehicles: Postponement of Strict Enforcement</h3>
<p>In order to rectify traffic, the Municipal Government's Public Utilities Bureau and the Police Bureau originally stipulated that all motor vehicles must have a license plate with "National...Shanghai" to be allowed to pass in the urban area starting today. Since this decision was made, many people have obtained license plates from the Public Utilities Bureau. However, because a large number of license plates are needed, and it is impossible to issue them all at once, it has been decided to postpone the implementation to the 20th of this month. At that time, the Municipal Police Bureau will strictly enforce it.</p>
<h3>US Authorities Strictly Deal With Military Vehicle Violations</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The US side is extremely strict in dealing with those who violate driving rules. On average, there are about four or five reports every day, but in recent days, it has been greatly reduced. If the violator is a non-military employee, they will be fired immediately after investigation. Military personnel, regardless of rank, will be detained for 30 days, fined, or demoted. In severe cases, they will be handed over to a military court for trial. After the implementation of driving on the right side of the road next month, the situation will be even more difficult. The US side has repeatedly notified all officers and soldiers that they must especially slow down before the Chinese are accustomed to it.</p>
<h3>Two Commissioners of Comfort Attend Symposium, Listen to Appeals from Industrial and Commercial Circles, Local Associations Continue to Hold Welcoming Parties Today</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Central Special Commissioners of Comfort, Ye Chu and Niu Yongjian, attended a symposium convened by the Xinwen Bao newspaper yesterday afternoon to listen to the appeals of leaders from the city's industrial and commercial circles. Those present included Pan Xulun, Xu Jiting, Xu Yongzuo, Qin Liankui, Kui Yanfang, Chen Taoyi, Cheng Cangbo, Zhan Wenhufu, and others.</p>
<p>Representatives Hope to Enhance Productivity</p>
<p>Pan Xulun was the first to offer his opinion, stating briefly that orders from local administrative organs should not conflict with existing laws. Secondly, administrative officials should lead by example in abiding by laws and regulations. Furthermore, administrative expenses must be economized. Subsequently, Supervising Censor Cheng Cangbo delivered a speech, stating briefly that the government should emphasize the five-power constitution, giving equal status to the legislative, examination, supervisory, judicial, and administrative branches, without favoring the administrative branch. For example, the judicial aspect in this city currently involves extremely complex and heavily burdened reporting of traitorous activities, yet there are only eleven prosecutors. Similarly, the Office of the Supervising Censor executes supervisory powers with heavy responsibilities, but the regular funding is only 300,000 yuan per month. Mr. Xu Yongzuo stated that people in the occupied areas, having long been oppressed by the enemy and puppet regimes, are afraid to express their opinions or recount their sufferings to the government. Under these circumstances, the government should take the initiative to diligently seek out the people's concerns. Mr. Xu also said that underground workers should be rewarded with honors or money, rather than with official positions as compensation. Kui Yanfang continued by saying that the government should focus on public security and seek to enhance the productivity of industry and commerce in this city. Qin Liankui recounted the suffering under the oppression of the enemy and puppet regimes, his voice choked with tears as he spoke. He then said that although there are many unsatisfactory issues since the victory, the current situation is significantly better than before. Finally, Commissioner Ye delivered a speech, stating briefly that he came to Shanghai hoping to hear more opinions from all sectors dissatisfied with the current situation, because if the people can express their suffering, it can encourage the government to improve. Mr. Ye is willing to relay all opinions to the central government. It is reported that Mr. Ye and Mr. Niu will attend a reception held by local associations today.</p>
<p>Ye Broadcasts Yesterday Introducing New Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Ye delivered a speech on the Shanghai Broadcasting Station last night entitled "Introducing New Shanghai." The main points are as follows: (1) According to the Premier's Founding Strategy and the President's "The Destiny of China," Shanghai is of important value and must be actively reorganized and expanded. (2) Shanghai is a region where talents gather and people from all directions reside. In economics, attention should be paid to Shanghai; in politics, Shanghai should also be considered. (3) The people of Shanghai are capable and enterprising, trained, possess common knowledge, and are relatively well-organized. (4) Shanghai should take on the responsibility of helping others, and only Shanghai has the strength to help others. (5) The good customs of all provinces should be concentrated in Shanghai. (6) Shanghai is a cultural center, and the publishing industry, the education sector, writers, and students are all second to none. In particular, young students have unlimited prospects. Finally, Mr. Ye expressed his unique and boundless hope and earnestness for Shanghai.</p>

<p>At around 9 p.m. in Huayang Bridge Town, east of Songjiang's east gate, over twenty plainclothes bandits speaking local and Jiangbei dialects, each carrying modern firearms, first robbed small pig boats moored in the town's river, and then broke into the Xi Yongyuan general store, using the gun's handle to injure the store's young owner, who fled in pain from the back, provoking the bandits' anger, who fired two shots, hitting another store owner, Xi Tianling, in the leg, before turning to rob the Hengmao South Goods store, bagging relatively valuable items from both stores, as well as clothing and legal tender, and heading northeast. It is reported that the losses of the two stores are each worth tens of millions of yuan, and the pig boats also lost over 50 million.

<h3>Social Services: American and Chinese Athletes Compete, Thousands Line the Streets to Watch the Game</h3>
<p>Observing the Art of Basketball - A Rare Opportunity. Benefiting the Impoverished - Education Assistance First.</p>
<p>Tonight at 7:00 p.m., American and Chinese athletes will compete in a basketball game at the China Sports Field. The anticipation has been building in Shanghai for some time, and general fans are eagerly waiting. At that time, there will be a scene of thousands lining the streets, vying to be first. The motivation for this game is entirely to raise funds for education assistance, to relieve impoverished students, to enable them to continue their education, strive for progress, and complete their studies. This meaning is very profound. Therefore, enthusiastic people are doing their best to support, saving on unnecessary waste, buying a few honorary tickets or regular tickets, and accompanying their siblings, relatives, or old friends, to appreciate the excellent basketball skills. The courage of the athletes of both countries is so exciting and pleasant, and indirectly helping the suffering of out-of-school youths is so psychologically comforting. I earnestly urge you all: to vigorously promote and introduce this great undertaking with active meaning!</p>
<p>In order to facilitate busy people, this office has entrusted eight places to sell ball tickets. Please contact them nearby. The locations are: International Hotel, Wing On Company Gift Certificate Department, Grand Theater, Grand China Theater, Nanjing Theater, Xianqiao YMCA, Tongde Medical College, and this office. As for the technical aspects of the competition, it has been reported in detail by our newspaper and the sports pages of various newspapers, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<h3>Report on Donations for the Sino-American Basketball Charity Game</h3>
<p>We are grateful to all sectors of society for purchasing honorary tickets for the charity game yesterday, enthusiastically helping education and benefiting the impoverished.</p>
<p>Shi Zhifu, Zhong Biao, Zhongnan Bank, Ding Fangyuan, Jianghai Bank, Sun Ruihuang, Xu Chao, Wang Boyuan. Each of the above 12,000 yuan, Gu Nanqun 9,000 yuan, Tu Kaiwei, Yuan Hesong, Wah Fei Tobacco Company, Bao Guochang, Chen Bangdian, Sino-British Pharmacy, Chen Zhitang, Ke Ji, Sincere Company, Yan Bolin, Yang Fuchen, Yao Junzhi, Cai Shengbai, Wang Jitao.

<h3>Local Magazines: Two Hundred and Sixteen Types</h3>
<p>Since the victory, up to the present, the total number of magazines published in this city has reached 216, with a monthly circulation of over one million copies. Among them, 180 types have been registered with the Bureau of Social Affairs. At least five of the remaining 36 types have been suspended due to financial reasons. Looking back at the publishing industry in Shanghai in the first half of the year, not only was it restricted by the enemy and puppet regimes, but the quantity was also less than 50 types. It can be seen that the freedom of speech and publication in the recovered area has been demonstrated in the number of magazines. The following is a statistical analysis of the nature of the 216 magazines: 91 general types, 10 children and youth types, 17 literary types, 13 popular types, 2 science types, 18 film and theater types, 11 industrial types, 19 pictorial types, 5 commercial and economic types, 8 language types, 8 medical and health types, 5 women's types, and 9 other types, for a total of 216 types.</p>

<h3>Cousin Comes to Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Mei Youyun</p>
<p>When the first steamboat down from Chongqing returned, it brought my cousin, whom I hadn't seen for many years. He came to this mountain city easily and happily. In this small house, we happily listened to him tell us about all sorts of things in Shanghai. He told us that this trip from Shanghai to Chongqing was such a pleasant journey. The train from Shanghai to Nanjing was so fast, and the boat from Nanjing to Chongqing was so good. There were so few passengers. It made my heart fly out of my chest, to Shanghai and then back to Chongqing. Flying back and forth. Easy and pleasant.</p>
<p>He told me he came to Chongqing to pick up his luggage. He bought a boat ticket and would go back to Shanghai right away. At most, he would only be delayed for a few days. So he and a friend who came with him were staying at the Victory Building for 6,000 yuan a day.</p>
<p>More than half a month later, I met my cousin on the street again. He greeted me in a hurry, with a worried look on his face. He told me that boat tickets were hard to buy. The room rate at the Victory Building was increasing the longer he stayed, so he had moved into the Times Inn. He was running around everywhere trying to buy a boat ticket.</p>
<p>Twenty-some days later, my cousin appeared in our small house again. He was already looking impatient and anxious. He said boat tickets were really hard to find. After running around for more than a month, he had finally found a "way," which required him to pay 250,000 yuan for the "ticket price" to pretend to be a worker in the coal bunker, holding a shovel to "load coal." He was willing to pay the money, but he didn't know how to "load coal," so that route had to be "blown."</p>
<p>A few days later, he ran over in the middle of the night and gave me some foreign books, saying they were hard to carry. He said I could keep them to read. I asked him if he had found a "way" yet. He said he had. He was asked to pay 200,000 yuan to pretend to be a sailor's son. He was going to meet this fake father tomorrow. It was like a play! As long as he could go back.</p>
<p>But a month passed, and I still hadn't received a letter from my cousin saying he had returned to Shanghai. The "way" of pretending to be a son must have "blown" again.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from my cousin from Yichang. He said he had arrived in Yichang. He had to find another "way."</p>
<p>Holding this letter, I recalled the easy and pleasant way he was when he first arrived in Chongqing!</p>

<h3>Studying Mussolini's Brain</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>American military doctors examined Mussolini's brain tissue under a microscope, but found no signs to explain why the fascist leader was so violent.</p>
<p>Colonel Ash, director of the U.S. Army Medical Museum, said that the museum received two pieces of Mussolini's forebrain. The study of these two pieces of forebrain has not been completely completed. As far as the results obtained so far, Mussolini's brain has no disease or structural defects.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Ohaushep, director of the National St. Elizabeth's Mental Hospital in the United States, believes that Mussolini's brain has no physiological or structural defects, but this does not mean that he has no mental illness.</p>
<p>Dr. Ohaushep said, "Brain physiological defects are often the cause of mental illness; however, mental patients do not necessarily have significant brain defects. In addition to brain physiology, there are other factors that can affect a person's behavior. For example, living environment, the body's chemical mechanisms - especially the activity of the adrenal glands, can affect a person's brain and even a person's behavior."</p>
<p>Colonel Ash said: "You can't rely on microscopic examination of the brain to determine that he is a genius or an ordinary person. What the microscope can see is only severe brain structural defects, such as intellectual weakness. Mussolini is obviously not a person with intellectual weakness."</p>

<h3>Business Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Yale</p>
<p>Various industries in our country are still very fragile. "Poor personnel management" is of course one of the main reasons, but there are too many people engaging in infighting for private gain, and too little competition for normal progress, which is also a real situation. As a result, people who are not worthy of their names and those who have made ill-gotten gains fill society, while those who have truly achieved success in their careers and can "benefit the country and the people" are rare.</p>
<p>In fact, people's evaluation should not be based on wealth and status, but on the meaning and contribution of their careers. Although the War of Resistance has been completed, the work of nation-building is still in its early stages. If the youth of today still have the wrong understanding of this, then the future of the country is still unimaginable. Therefore, it is very important for every young person to have their own business philosophy and take on the heavy responsibility of nation-building. Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen said: "With the spirit of tens of millions of our people who will die in a few decades, we will create a foundation that will last for hundreds of millions of years." This is to instruct young people to establish a business philosophy and work hard to create it. Although an immortal career cannot be achieved by everyone, regardless of the size of the career, we must do our best to contribute to human welfare. The so-called "learning for application" is to use what we have learned in meaningful work, which is the correct business philosophy of young people.</p>
<p>Although everything at present is too far from ideal, it is inevitable to be disappointed, but we must know that the war has just ended, and all order has not yet been restored. We still have to go through a short period of hardship, which is also expected. As long as the whole country works hard to overcome the hardship, this period of hardship will be easily shortened. Understanding this, there is really no need to be disappointed and depressed, but we should be more energetic and move forward. Hold on to the business philosophy and work hard for the cause of nation-building.</p>
<p>It is not a concern for a person to go through a period of hardship. If he does not achieve success in his career and cannot fulfill his responsibilities to society and the country, then it is truly regrettable. Therefore, Mencius said: "A gentleman has lifelong worries, but no momentary misfortune." This sentence is indeed the truth, and we should think about it repeatedly.</p>

<h3>The Enemy (Eighteen)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, Translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>"Are you saying that man escaped?" the General asked weakly. He had been operated on a week earlier, and Sadao had been called in to perform the emergency surgery that night. Sadao had twenty-four hours to determine whether the general would live. The disease had spread to the gallbladder too much. Then the old man began to breathe deeply again and want to eat. Sadao could not ask about the assassination. As far as he knew, they had never come. The servants had all returned, and Hana had thoroughly cleaned the guest room, and had even used sulfur inside to fumigate away the white man's smell. No one had said anything. The only one who was angry was the gardener, because the chrysanthemum season was over.</p>
<p>But a week later, Sadao felt that the General was a little better, and he could tell him about the prisoner.</p>
<p>Sadao was now saying, "Yes, sir, he escaped." He coughed, indicating that he had not finished what he wanted to say, but was unwilling to disturb the General any further. But the old man suddenly opened his eyes and looked at him.</p>
<p>He said forcefully, "That prisoner, didn't I promise you that I would kill him for you?"</p>
<p>Sadao said, "You did, sir."</p>
<p>The old man said in surprise, "Yes, I did say that. But you know, I was very sick. To be honest, I didn't think of anything but myself. To put it simply, I forgot what I promised you."</p>
<p>Sadao murmured, "I was wondering too, sir."</p>
<p>The General said, "This is indeed my negligence. But you also know that this is not unpatriotic or negligent of duty." He looked anxiously at his doctor. "If this matter is revealed, can you understand this?"</p>
<p>Sadao said, "Yes, sir." He suddenly realized that the General was in his control, and in the end, he was safe. He said to the General, "I can vouch for your loyalty and your enthusiasm for resisting the enemy."</p>
<p>The General murmured, "You are a good man, you can be rewarded." He closed his eyes.</p>
<h3>I am</h3>
<p>— Lin Bao</p>
<p>I am the recorder of the times.</p>
<p>I speak every language in the world, I go to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>I bring knowledge, inspiration, and entertainment to mankind.</p>
<p>I am the enemy of ignorance and slavery, the ally of enlightenment and freedom.</p>
<p>I interact with people at any time, encouraging them to move forward and pointing them in the right direction.</p>
<p>I treat people of all races, colors, beliefs, and social statuses equally.</p>
<p>I have the power to expand human horizons, deepen their emotions, improve their commerce, and fulfill their lives.</p>
<p>I am a true friend, a wise consultant, and a loyal leader.</p>
<p>I am as quiet as gravity, as gentle and powerful as electricity, and as durable as the mountains of eternity.</p>
<p>I am a book?</p>

<h3>Rumors of Differential Exchange Rates Abound, Market Favors Cash over Gold</h3>
<p>Gold Prices Close with a Weakening Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market started high and then fell sharply, gaining strength then becoming weak. Small investors rushed to buy, but banks took the opportunity to release stocks. Large investors shifted from long to short positions, leading to extreme volatility. The morning saw a strong upward trend, with prices once surging above 770,000. However, large investors sold aggressively after advancing, turning the market bearish. Rumors of Chairman Chiang's visit to Shanghai prompted many small investors to liquidate their positions, causing prices to fall back to below 720,000. Ultimately, the market closed with a slight gain compared to the previous day's close. Sichuan banks profited by unloading their holdings, and the market gradually became more fluid. General sentiment remained cautious about raising the market too much, despite differing opinions on the new exchange rate. As such, today's gold prices reached saturation points twice, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both times, the market lost its will and changed after the big investors sold stocks. Thereafter, the market persisted in a fixed situation. Jewelry stores listed gold ornaments at 79,000, tael silver at 600 yuan, silver coins at around 440 yuan. The spot exchange rate remained at around one corner. Small investors dared not take action easily, and the money supply remained abundant.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>U.S. dollar initially saw strong market conditions with individuals going to sell gold to buy US notes, with the market robust pushing above 1310 yuan. Foreign traders, trading companies, and large holders aggressively discounted and sold their holdings at high prices. The markets then were loose and easy which saw an immediate retracement to near 1260. Then the gold price went up. However, in the afternoon, the color shifted again in the gold market. The merchants all rushed to sell their US notes which saw a sharp decline back down to 1200. In the end the US note still finished up 50 plus or minus yuan over the previous day. The spread between the price of 10 taels of Gold vs the US dollar shrunk from 620 yuan down to 580. Finally it settled a bit higher around 600. In general there was an obvious feeling of gold being less desirable vs. holding cash, which was under the influence of different exchange rates. The HK dollar also followed a trend of going up and then going down again. Old HK dollar notes had previously traded near 240 yuan, and the new ones went near 70 yuan, however, in the end they both finished similar to the trend seen on the previous day.</p>
<p>Securities Public bonds trended generally flat, top rated shares were okay. Lesser rated shares were off a little bit. Finally, the market finished down around 5 yuan to 15 yuan. Local shares followed the same pattern as gold by going up and then falling in value, traders took advantage of the high levels to sell, as a result, the price of Mayer, after going up as high as 305 Yuan, did not stay up at those levels. Mayer's share price finished up 20, Yarn shares finished up 40. Jingfu finished up 2, Qin Xing and Xin Guang both finished up 1.5. However, the market was still more than half a percent off of its high levels that it was seeing earlier that day. The foreign shares also trended to be flat. Iisha Iip and Paper all showed gains. Other shares finished down around 10 percent. Some people were interested.</p>
<p>Rice Grain Yesterday's rice market saw an uptick of prices of goods from inland due to an increase in the cost of goods coming in. As a result, white rice from Jiangxi all went up 400 or 500 yuan. Slightly earlier rice from North went down a bit, and the price went up 600 or 700 yuan. White rice finished up 600 or 700 yuan. There were still a lot of cooking oil coming in, with the prices up 300 to 500 yuan. Demand for soybean oil outstripped supply which saw prices going up 1000 yuan. Flour was also up 100 or 200 yuan. Supplies of yellow beans were low which also resulted in demand being higher than supply. High quality ingredients were up 400 or 500 and middle and lower quality ingredients also went up 200 to 300 yuan. Sales of raw ingredients also recovered which saw prices up 1000 yuan. The Soybean market also finished up a bit more than 100 yuan. However, the alcohol market stayed pretty quiet.</p>
<p>Yarn Market The market opened too high in the morning, a good four or five million more than yesterday. However, with sellers lining up to get their orders in, the market trended down all the way. For example, a 16 thread Guangming yarn fell straight from 350 thousand all the way down to 320 thousand. 20 thread and 32 thread threads saw a sharp decrease in demand. However, the mills were still trying to sell a lot, however, they were seeing little activity and the orders were few and far between, Even though it finished up one or two million over where it was from the day before, the trend still seemed very fragile and nervous.</p>
