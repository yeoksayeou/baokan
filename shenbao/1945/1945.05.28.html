<h3>日軍特攻機立體布陣　對冲繩展開總攻　那覇首里間陸上戰鬥慘烈</h3>
<p>南西羣島基地二十七日中央社電　日陸軍航空部　，自二十四日夜迄二十五日晨，舉全力以優勢且有效之立體機動戰術，對冲繩本島展開特別總攻擊，日軍戰力之充實，規模之宏大，以及戰意之旺盛，實沖繩作戰切來所罕見者，故攻軍效果亦極顯着。敵白於冲繩登陸以來，迄已兩月，而日軍陸上部隊，屢次以寡兵制敵大軍，與敵以莫大損害，十八日以來，那覇，省里間主要戰塲一帶，已完全充滿砲火硝烟，地上戰鬥慘烈已極，敵之先鋒部隊，已逐漸接近首里，那覇郊外。</p>
<p>二十四日之敵軍海上兵力，計共戰艦六艘，巡洋艦十艘，驅逐艦五十艘，運輸船大型者一百五十五艘，小型者一百四十艘，較二十日前後之敵勢，增加驅逐艦約二倍，運輸船六倍。又二十四日下午，以空母九艘爲基幹之敵機動部隊，分爲二批，出現於德之島一帶，本島附近敵艦船之往來益形頻繁，同時羣島沿岸之惡劣低氣壓亦逐漸加甚，此種情形阻碍日航空隊活躍，而此惡劣氣候却有利於敵軍，於是冲繩戰局愈趨險惡，此時以振武隊爲中心之日軍有力航空特別總攻擊，其意義極爲深邃，養精蓄銳，待機出動之各飛行部隊，乘氣候晴朗，一齊開始裝擊，猛烈段近冲繩戰塲。</p>
<p>對三處機塲作波狀攻擊</p>
<p>二十四日前半夜，飛龍轟炸隊於戰鬥機隊掩護下，勇敢出動，急襲伊江島及中部，北部三飛行塲，整夜以少數飛機續行波狀攻擊，牽制敵方三處基地，而大山隊長所指揮之義烈空挺隊，立即開始行動，向中部，北部兩飛機塲强行降下，義烈隊員自輸送機躍下後，當即以敵飛機爲目標而散開，敵機並無任何僞裝及適蔽，義烈隊員遂即搬運携帶之新武器，片刻之間，使敵機發生大火，而敵軍亦因日軍突　其來，莫知所措。日義烈空挺隊及飛龍轟炸隊，於夜色中恣意蹂躪敵軍機地，使中北兩機塲完全不能使用。二十五日黎明，日飛能特攻隊又繼續進擊嘉手納海面，對砲擊日陸軍之敵艦船　行壯烈衝擊，飛龍特攻隊所携帶之炸彈，任何艦船亦難抵抗。該時護衛戰艦之敵驅逐艦倉皇逃避，竟有與奔逃之運輸船發生正面衛撞者。</p>
<p>振武特攻隊使用新戰術</p>
<p>同時，日軍飛燕·破　·山吹·九段·蔽隱·悠久·降魔·天誅·櫻花等振武時攻險之各隊，自　地一齊飛起，組成若干梯形編隊，相互保持有效之距離間隔及高度，以龐大之立體陣勢，果敢肉搏。此種多數機之立體編隊，波形肉搏，乃鏽所未曾使用之新戰術，敵軍已全被日軍武咸壓倒，振武隊未受敵戰鬥機之抵抗，亦未遭敵艦之對空射擊，得進抵目標上空，此尚屬首次，飛龍轟炸隊及飛龍特攻隊，獲得甚大戰果。自嘉手納以至系滿，淡川，布滿敵運輸船殘骸，日本靑年以血潮所獲戰果之大恐佈，實出台人預料之外。此次特別總攻擊結果，依賴物量之敵，於瞬息間失　戰力，混亂狼狽不堪，敵軍之悲境，可想而知。</p>
<p>日義烈空挺隊收獲大戰果　尼米資承認攻擊强烈</p>
<p>前綫航空基地二十七日中央社電　關於急襲冲繩本島之義烈空挺部隊之偉大戰果，頃據冲繩現地軍向基基地報告稱，北機塲被轟炸處達一百五十處以上，至二十五日上午六時，仍在延燒中。</p>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　日特攻隊義機塲降陸，使敵陷於混亂狀態，由關島發來之合衆社電，至二十六日始確認上項事實，同時發表攻擊情形如次：日航空部隊超低空機槍描射之際，日軍雙發機多架，乃於北飛行塲强行降落，日兵均一齊由機中跳出，沐浴月光，手火燃燒。一方尼米資司令部二十七日公報稱，日軍海陸呼應，於過去數週間對冲繩木島美軍實施最熾烈之攻擊，日特攻隊之攻擊，為此次戰爭開始最强烈者云，反映日特攻隊及航空部隊之奮鬥。</p>
<h3>紀念日海軍節　郝省長談話</h3>
<p>徐州三十七日中央社電　今日爲盟邦日本四十屆海軍節紀念，郝省長爲喚起民衆，激勵所屬，對海軍節之澈底了解與認識，以昂揚決戰精神，期完成興華保亞使命，特發表談話，大意謂：「今天是盟邦日本第四十屆海軍紀念日，値此大東亞戰爭決戰年之今日，我們紀念盟邦日本海軍節，更應產生新的姿態，新的目標，强化中國海防綫，加緊靑年制海部隊，灌輸民衆對海戰的知識，以科學的智能，以愛國的熟誠，以全國上下團結的力量，總動員我們所有的人力，物力，財力，智力，羣策羣力，一掃我國過去海軍之腐敗，而完成參戰鐵壁。凡我同胞，除應警覺其意義之重大，與盟邦日本共同勉勵外，更應迅速完遂興舉保亞，擊滅英美的時代使命。」</p>
<h3>美第八航空隊司令　調太平洋作戰</h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據華盛頓訊：前駐英國之美第八航空隊司令杜立德爾，昨日返歸華盛頓，聞將有新任命，派至太平洋作戰。</p>
<h3>蘇省黨部　調整機構</h3>
<p>蘇州二十七日中央社電　中國國民黨爲强化組織，鞏固黨基，巳恢復各級黨部選舉制度，省市以下各級黨部選舉已次第完畢，各省市（特別市）黨部之選舉，亦將開始。最近中央黨部對於黨部機稱加以調整，江蘇省黨部方面，日前接奉中央訓令並頒發之强化黨務及黨部機構簡素化方案，先行關整內部機構。聞該部原設之一室三處，現決遵照中央方案從事簡素化，改設總務·組織·民調三處，除組織處仍舊不動外，將原有之書記長室改爲總務處，歸併宣傳處事務在內，以原任書記長充任處長，新設之民訓處，專辦民衆訓練事務，即以原任社會處長充任處長。聞該項調整業經任兼主任委員核准，於六月一日起實行，並呈報中央備案。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>急待解救的民食問題</h3>
<p>目前是决戰時期，一切的一切，當以決戰勝利爲第一義。因此，在決戰的過程中，在爭取决勝的過程中，務必集中一切的力量，在這大前提之下，我們今天不能不提出當前民生問題中最嚴重的民食問題。黑市米已漲到二十大關以上，其他民生必需品的價格跟着躍勝，不要說多數「升斗小民」已瀕於生活的危境，就是收入較優的高級薪水階級，又何嘗不陷入水深火熱之地？而且，這次物價的漲潮，還有兩大特徴値得焦慮：第一，從空間說，這次不如過去　大都市領導的物價波動，而相反的，是由四鄕及小都巿米價狂躍領導，而普及各地的物價狂瀾。第二，從時間上說，這次以食糧爲中心的狂漲，是在靑黃不接初期就開始的，因此又不同於平當週期性的物價波動，而是持續的增漲的物價大波瀾。從這兩層觀察，我們不能不憂慮到，第一：這次受物價牽制的範圍極廣大，從地域說，幾乎遍及江浙和平區境，從階層說，幾乎遍及各種薪俸生活者，因此，結果，顯然不能不影響到對於「中國現地物資戰力化」，不能不影響到「集中國力對日協力完遂戰爭」等政策。</p>
<p>所以，我們必須大聲疾呼：如再不急謀解救和平區內的民生問題，特別是，如果再不急謀解救和平區的民食問題，那麼，任何「協力參加決戰」和任何「物資戰力化」政策，都將失去實際意義。今日誰言完遂大東亞戰爭，誰當先謀解決民生問題！</p>
<p>就事實言，今日和平區的問題，決不是任何一方面單獨的力量所能解決的，這在四五年來和平區一切政治經濟的事實所早已證明了。所以，我們今日要求迅速解救民食問題，我們必要　請中日雙方負責當局，從遠處大處着眼，從中國完遂戰爭的共同目標着想，毫無掩飾地去調査和研究：今日和平區的糧食問題，究竟是怎樣發生的？經過周密的調査和硏究以後，必能發現根本的癥結所在，再「實事是求」（我們必須特別强調這四個字）去謀求解決的辦法，善謀切實救濟的辦法。我們日言把握民心，中日協力，現在解救民食問題，就是這種共同要求最重要的測騐。我們今日只要解決得了這個日趨危急的民食問題，那麽，所謂把握巨心，中日協力種種問題都可迎刃而解，獲得滿意的成功、</p>
<p>在中日當局調查硏究設法澈底解救的期問，我們首先希望本市當局速謀局部及治標的對策。據我們所知，淮海省雜開生產豐稔，頗有裕餘，當局似可設法採辦來滬，迅速配給於一般市民，以期稍解燃眉之急。我們相信，今日的糧價狂漲，一方面固然主要由於來源不暢，另一方面食料品配給不機，致使市儈板俏居奇，也不容忽視，如果能先增加戶口雜糧配給量，多少也可綏和足食問題的嚴重性，而待中日常局合力的最妥善的解決。</p>
<h3>少數B29型機　昨分襲九州　日機在關門猛烈迎擊</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　敵B29型機約八架，二十七日上午零時二十分起迄一時二十分，以一架或二架編隊，由豐後水道侵入，在大分縣國東半島，山口縣西方海面，關門地區行動，投下機雷，由一時二十分起迄二時半左右，由豐後水這次第逸去。又另批敵機約八架，於零時五十分迄一時五十分，發入鹿兒島縣南部，由鹿克島縣西方海面北上，盤旋於長崎縣西方海面，佐賀縣北部海岸地帶，福岡縣博多　附近，投下機雷後，經大分縣中部南下，於一時二十分起由豐後水道方面逸去。日機在關門天空猛烈迎擊，確認擊毀B29型二架。又另有B29型一架，於上午四時五十分侵入大隅半島南部，由九州東岸北上，在國東半島山口縣行動，五時五十分左右由廣島縣向南逸去。又B29型一架、於上午十一時發入豐後水道，在大分縣國東半島關門地區盤迥後，在日本海有所行動，旋經山口縣西部逸去，曾在大分縣投下炸彈，但地上無損失。又敵B29型巡起機二架，於上午十一時起約二小時，於朝鮮海峽五爲列島附近行動後，向南逸去。</p>
<h3>空襲日本土乃牽制作戰</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　馬里亞納着地之敵空軍，二十三日夜繼續攻擊，於二十五日夜復以敵機二百五十架對東京來襲，投下燒夷彈，日方遭受相當捐害，敵機此次來襲企圖，據觀察實乃敵方爲牽制日方自四月中旬以來對冲繩之連續航空攻擊起見，故以其主力，竭力對九州，中國地區之日方航空基地，施行戰術轟炸。按敵B29型轟炸機隊一貫之作戰使命，即對本土之戰略轟炸，殆呈偉止狀態，但由於沖繩本島之日陸空軍英勇善戰，知始終對九州，中國地區之局部的戰術轟炸，企圖牽制日軍作戰爲不可能事，乃將B29型機還返其本來之作戰使命，以對日東京及主要都市採取戰略轟炸。前於十四日，十七日兩次對名古屋戰略轟炸，已爲其再轉換之第一步，被等之轉換目的，企圖將日方生產態勢破壞，以使日國民之戰意動搖，其結果爲冲繩決戰之牽制作戰，彰彰明甚。日美即取決於此殊死作戰，因須展開極慘酷戰鬥，於現階段雙方決戰，決非僅限於一局部，敵之攻勢，向日本土採取一切手段與方法，自無待言。思里亞納之B29之現勢，因敵之作最後孤注一擲之努力，其最合於基地條件及實力活動機數兩方面俱相當强化，故再度施行二十四時間轟炸，有相當可能。</p>
<h3>日本的大學生與特攻隊</h3>
<p>對談　艦隊報道部：松本大尉　本報：記者</p>
<p>從東京帝大的學生生活說起</p>
<p>記者：今天欣逢日本第四十屆海軍節，我們想起四十年前日本海軍光榮的勝利，更想起現在海軍將士共同勇戰的情形，覺得很是興奮。</p>
<p>現在的日本海軍的特攻隊，傎是日本「海軍魂」的表現。特攻隊的隊員大多是各大學的畢業生，有許多還是東京帝國大學的同學。松本大尉是東京帝大的前輩，而且現在正負着海軍報導的責任，對約同窗學友的特攻精神，一定能有深刻的見解，關於這方面請多多發表意見。</p>
<p>松本：東京帝國大學確是足以懷念的，赤門或是正門裏面幷列的二排銀杏樹，現在正是新綠成蔭的時候。我們時常同在那些銀杏樹的綠蔭下往來的同學，近來時常在報紙上或是無綫電中聽到他們的名字，原來他們已經參加了特攻隊，使我也自然而然的對他們肅然起敬，並且自己更堅定了報國的決心。</p>
<p>他們超越了生死關頭，毅然決然的行動，可以說是必然的。在學生時代，或者被人家說，現在的學生熱情還不够，或者還得認眞用功等等，那是因為對於當時國內的事情與世界的問題總覺得還有不足的地方，所以懷疑而思索起來；等到大東亞戰爭開戰以來，大學生心頭的陰　為之一掃，大家發見了一個遠大的方向，各人走上各人這種熱情，也可以設把自我忘記了的一種信念，這就是一種原動力，而且隨着戰局的進展，而愈發揮起來，就是赴湯蹈火，因為為祖國而奮鬥，所以也看得很是平淡。</p>
<p>記者：日本靑年的這種精神眞是足以欽佩的，可是一般中國的靑年也許對於特攻隊的精神還不能充分了解，請松本大尉再詳細的加以說明。</p>
<p>松本：日本靑年的特攻精神也不是怎樣超越常情的東西。在學生時代上敎練課時不十分上勁的人一到應召出征的時候，就不必在何說明，高高興興地決計把自己的生命完全貢獻給陛下，爲國家的大義而犧牲自己。這種意志是如何培養起來的呢？雖然有種種要素，可是一言以蔽之，可以說因爲日本天皇是至高無上的，日本民族保衛日本，保衛東亞而發的殉國精神與靑年原有的熱情凝合起來，這就造成了特攻隊的精神。所以最初提議用特攻隊攻擊的，也是年輕的人。蘇羅門戰以後雖然廠大的戰果繼續不斷，可是耍制勝敵人的物量不能不用「一機一艦」，「一死百殺」的特別攻擊，所以有特攻隊的進言，而見諸實施。</p>
<p>特攻精神與傳統精神</p>
<p>記者：我們相信日本靑年的血液中，還流着武士道的精神。現在在國家盛衰興敗的關頭，自然而然的這種潛在的武土道精神復現了出來。這種精神，我想，和楠公的「七生報國」的精神是一脈相通的。日本中世武士道的權威「葉隱」中曾經這樣說過：「所謂武士道就是尋找死處，在生死二種塲所，以早死爲愈，別無仔細，必須堅定意志前進」，大意就是說要得其死處，現在特攻隊員們戰牲小我而貢獻於大我的精神，正和「葉隱」中的武士道精神相符合。個人超越了生死的關頭，以個人的死而貢獻於國家的生，這是靑年應有的態度。日本靑年的特攻情神與傳統精神的關聯也請松本大尉加以闡明。</p>
<p>松本：所謂日本精神，很難簡單明瞭的說明。可是提綱絜領的說，日本精神是以日本的　國精神爲基礎，我們讀日本神代的歷史時，覺到其中有着透澈的人類，世界的理論，也有着宇宙的眞理。後來，日本雖然受了隨唐以後中國的儒家文化的影響，間接又從中國受了佛敎的影響，可是儒家，佛家的文化的精髓都吸收了過來，日本的宇宙觀，世界觀，人生觀，因此更充實起來。等到日本的戰國時代，遭到極大的試煉，而完成渾然一體的武士道。當然可以說，日本的特攻精神是繼承着日本的傳統精神的。</p>
<p>記者：松本大尉對於日本精神有很具體着「殺身成仁」，「捨身取義」的精神，我想，這和特攻隊的精神也是一脈相通的；並且在佛敎思想中，有一種超越死生的「無常觀」，回爲這種禪的修養在日本很普遍，大概對於特攻隊的精神也有影響。總之，特攻隊的精神可以說是强烈的靑年的生命力的最高表現，已經近於中國所謂「朝聞道，夕可死矣」的境地。</p>
<p>松本：不但是儒家與佛敎的精神有關係，就是老子的無爲而無不爲的思想也與特攻隊精神有影響。（未完）</p>

<h3>實部令經濟局主動調整評價　並與關係當局嚴厲執行限價</h3>
<p>近日物價狂漲，各方無不重視，實業部鑒於過去評價工作，多係被動，由公會申請，再行加以核議，且開會時間，往往相隔甚久，以致所評價格，罕切實際，結果執行遵守，雙方皆感困難。茲悉實業部為肅正此項措施起見，已規定評價新辦法，令飭經濟局即行主動的調整評價，使之合理。並與關係當局嚴厲執行限價。其要點：</p>
<p>應隨時調查主要商品成本，除由各業公會申請加以核議外，並應　據調查結果，擬定限價，提交評價委員會議決施行。</p>
<p>對於主要食用農產品，爲使切合實情，得由主管機關先行評定限價，予以實施，再送請評價委員會追認。</p>
<p>再各主要商品同業公會，原負有監督各該會會員業務之資任，但事實上各菜公會能實施監督者，尚慶少數，爲防止各業會員非法操縱市價起見，該部並令飭經濟局切實督飭各業同業公會監督會員業務，嚴禁業外人非法買賣，以期抑平物價之暴漲。</p>
<p>評價委會今日集議</p>
<p>巿經濟局鑒於本巿物價又見暴漲，且漲勢較過去尤甚，經派調査員密査結果，其中雖難免有特殊情形，但仍有一般非法商人，從甲國積操　市價，故對於囤積商人將擬有更進一步取締懲處辦法，決嚴厲執行。並奉陳實部長令，强化評議物價，故已督飭市物價評議委員會從速再行評議。茲悉該會定今（廿八）日召開委員會議，將按照最近市情評議，核定新限價。聞除評議核定主要商品皺價外，對於次要商品，亦將核定限價。</p>
<h3>日海軍節演講會　昨繼續舉行</h3>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會爲紀念盟邦日本第四十屆海軍節，昨（二十七）日假大華戲院舉行第二次演講會，諸中央海軍學校校長姜西園中將演講，市宣傳處亦派員出席，本市大中學校學生到塲聽講者，不下千餘名。由新聞協會區分會常務理事陳日平主席，首先報告紀念盟邦海軍節意義，繼請姜校長演講，歷時四十五分鐘，旋放映華影名片「莫忘今宵」，至正午十二時散會。</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>主度陳日平致詞，略謂：「今日爲盟邦日本第四十屆海軍紀念節，四十年前，即當日本明治三十八年時，俄俄兩國在日本海激戰，日本曾將帝俄艦隊擊滅。查日本海軍向具必勝信念，作戰勇敢，自擊取帝俄後，日本海軍更日趨強化，現在於此大東亞戰爭中，尤具特攻精神，殲擊英美海軍，使敵重創，我人對此日本之傳統精神，深爲欽佩。」</p>
<p>姜校長詞</p>
<p>姜西園中將演講詞，略謂：「關於大東亞戰局，各位均已深切明療，且盟邦報道機關，亦發表戰况頗多。目前戰局發展，可謂千變萬化，盟邦高橋大將對於戰局前途，曾闡述頗詳，無庸贅述。査首次世界戰爭在經濟上，有密切運擊，在今次大戰上，不論在陸海空方面，且包括政治及經濟二方面，因此我人對大東亞之戰爭，不能認爲前機作戰，此乃整個全民族之作戰。</p>
<p>在民族作戰方面，歷史地理均有緊密聯擊，故中日兩國始終不能擺脫此點。今後吾人不但應與前機駢肩合作，而在後方亦應一致圖結，以貢獻於大東亞戰爭。在大亞洲主義上，早已關明東亞民族聯合團結之傎諦，如「各愛其國，互愛其鄰，共衛東亞」。因此亞洲黃色人種必須緊密團結，否則，中日兩國如不眞誠合作，越離本位，將來必受命運上之支配。過去雖兄弟鬩牆，當今外侮必須共禦，因此吾人應檢討過去，創造將來，尚望深切體認，爲爭取整個民族之命運而奮鬥。」</p>
<h3>二凟聯警士　昨執行槍決</h3>

<h3>上週間物價　突起漲風</h3>
<p>本市金副與工商各業市况，最近一週來變動復見劇烈，投機市儈非常活動，有關各當局頗注意此種有關民生治安之嚴重間題。烚赤市况在中儲發行金證劵之後，頗趨穩定，隋市交易亦不似以往之猖　，上週一二三四仍在平靜狀態中，詎至週五突起驚人漲風，一跳四五十關，人心浮動，購求益盛，紋銀隨之高漲，公價亦步後塵而上升。華股自週一起至週五止，始終步趨高峯，一帆風順，直綫上升，美亞·永安公司·及紗廠三熱門股，每日均漲至飽和點，中小型票，無論實業股，紡織股，地產股，文化股，化學工業股，製藥股，大都均漲停板，每日成交額較前突增一倍以上，大有求過於供之勢，其繁盛情形，爲從來所罕見。週六半日市面略見回挫，惟脚地堅穩，市面銀根轉鬆，游資益見充斥。至於工商各業方面，可謂一片漲聲，米價較前週暴漲一倍以上，雜糧高漲亦厲，油糖均暴漲，購求尚感不易，日用品肥皂，火柴，洋燭，一致上升，各廠商門售價均改高甚多，尤其棉織品襪子汗衫掛牌標價變更尤大，一般市民生活，已頻最嚴重關頭，希經濟有關各執行當局，迅即探取抑制物價有效處置。</p>
<h3>日文敎育硏究所　昨正式成立</h3>
<p>上海特別市日文敎育研究所，於昨日午後假康樂酒家舉行成立典禮，到周市長代表敎育局長戴英夫，秘書戴不衡，暨土田公使代表高山調查官等。</p>
<p>籌備經過</p>
<p>首由主席戴英夫報吿籌備經過，略謂：「本會經月餘之籌備，迄今得之　事，其間承上野諸議及高山調齊官各位之多方協助，曷勝感激。敎局主辦本所意義，凡欲使硏究日文者，作進一步之硏究，無論公私立之大中學校，不論中日國籍之導師，均爲本所之一員，其中不但執敎者始得參加，即對日文有研究興趣者，亦可加入。敎局本此主張與各方連絡結果，開始籌備，承兩國人士熱烈贊助，終獲成功。」</p>
<p>巿長訓詞</p>
<p>繼請周巿長代表敎育局長戴英夫致訓，略謂：「在東方區域，有其東方文化偉大的所在，吾人要發揚此種東方王道文化之精神，唯有中日兩國人士共同努力。日本人士對中國文化，均極專心硏究，同時日本文化吾國人悉意硏究者亦頗不乏人，硏究所是會合中日兩國人士所結成，中日同志於此硏究所中，今後對日木文化可儘量介紹到中國，而中國文化亦可介紹到日本，同時更可發揚其優點，這是二點，兩國同志協力於中日百年大計，迄今七年，於茲期間，吾人加以檢討，可謂尚有許多缺點，欲補此缺陷，非由兩國敎育人士之努力不為功，希望研究同仁，不僅在創造東方新文化上着想，更要在中日前途上去努力，創造東亞永久和平，則成立本所意義日屬宏偉，尚盼各位加倍努力，完成本所負有之使命。」</p>
<p>嗣由高山調査官代表土田公使致詞，語多勉勵，旋即討論通過所章，末由各校中日敎師先後發表意見，約一小時餘散會。</p>

<h3>海洋美術展覽</h3>
<p>— 亞心</p>
<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會，爲紀念日本第四十屆海軍節，特舉行海洋美術展覽會，假外　十七號四樓大陸畫廊爲會塲。陳列作品六十餘幅，其種類分：　水彩，　油畫，　粉畫，　素描。由中日優秀畫家應徽，經海洋美術展覽會委員協議鑑定後，入選展覽，所以陳列諸作品，皆爲一時佳作。</p>
<p>當記者於海軍節日赴會塲參觀時，來賓異常擁擠，每個人都集中注意力欣賞這生氣勃勃的作品。</p>
<p>這些畫的題材，以普及海洋思想及有關生產運輸漁業等爲主。日本石岡偉的三幅水彩賽：「漁船」，「江海關」，「海軍磚頭」就是以描寫海洋生活爲體材的，他的筆力非常雄健，在單純的色彩中表現出種種洋面上的複雜情形，　屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>大木光的「乘長風而去」，用陰沈的色彩，來增加悲壯的氣氛，全幅用不同程度的深藍色，而徵露出一輸淡黃的峨眉目，尤其顯出夜色的悽凉。松林義英的「四川路橋風景，」是一幅現實的作品，顯出了上海的衆生相；在橋面上，有十幾個各色各樣行人，有人力車，有兩輛三輪車，其中一輛，正由三輪軍夫拉濟」橋，後面有一苦力帮助他推。這位畫家所運用的多色彩的筆觸，强調了畫而上的複雜性，這不得不使我們讚嘆這位畫家的天才和工力了。</p>
<p>項使記者感到驚奇的，是宮　羊邨以淡墨所畫成的一幅叫做「夕風」的帆船國，它是非常接近中國畫的法度，冲淡　逸，幾乎有點像宋人的作品了。而　尾吾一所盡的「戎克」（中國的譯名是帆船）就與上幅的情形不同了，它完全是西洋盡的風格，並列的帆船以深淺和變化繁多的色彩表現出來，而且顯出一絲一絲風帆上的布紋，從這種細膩的手法可知作者怎樣愼重處理他的題村。</p>
<p>關於描寫海洋和戰鬥情形的有：火木光的「冲繩海邊的海空大決戰」；田上淺之助的「鬥魂」；朝幷閑的「威容」；伊籘硏之的「艨艦」，「殲滅」，和「軍艦旗楊揚」；薛滿生的「艨艦鎖四海」等等，都是很有力的作品。西鄉三郎的「海」以明朗和陰沈的色彩，顯示出海洋的美麗和雄壯。朝井閑的「太平洋之晨」色彩很漂亮，紅日在雲層里透出光來，含蓄着深刻的意義。</p>
<p>我國畫家參加的有陸爾强·張眉孫·王子瑜等幾位。陸爾强的巨幅汕畫：「出海前的準備」，題：「出海前的準備」，題材色彩和拔巧都屬上乘。在畫面上有幾個漁夫向着海面結網，顯出了他們所焦急的和所金求的，這種聰明的　法，可以顯出作者的造詣不凡了。同一作者另一粉畫「怒吼」，色彩和佈局都有成功的地方。張眉孫的三幅水彩畫，「黃浦江」，「玄武湖」，「西湖」，前一輛畫面的騷動和後二幅的幽靜，可知作者是怎樣善於運用色彩來表現題材。</p>
<p>這個畫展是在二十五日開幕到三十日閉幕，展覽時問是在上午十時至下午五時，如果市民們要認識一下海洋的情景，早來參觀，免得　過這雖逢的機會。</p>
<h3>中日國民獻機昨擧行命名式　日海相代表湊武官長命名</h3>
<p>中日國民獻機命名典禮，昨晨九時半在虹口上海神社隆重舉行，計到日米內海軍大巨代表湊海軍武官長，命名委員長松島大佐，獻納者代表中國方面本報社長陳彬龢，日本方面上海興亞報國會會長豐田薰，上海居留民團長中島忠三郎，來賓及日本第五國民學校學生等數百人。命名式開始，日海軍樂隊特蒞塲奏樂，行禮如儀後，首由兩國獻納者代表中島忠三郎陳彬龢二氏相繼致詞，米內海軍大臣代表湊武官長命名，並頒發感謝狀。旋命名委員長松島大佐致詞，略謂。「由於中日兩國國民之赤忱，令日得舉行獻機命名典禮，衷心極感愉快，本人在此深表謝意。」最後全塲高呼萬歲，於十時許始告禮成。</p>
<p>日本方面代表致詞</p>
<p>中島忠三郎氏代表日本方面獻納者致詞云：「今日擧行獻納飛機命名典禮，本人代表獻納者向海軍大臣代理官閣下貢獻一言。今日命名之獻機，為吾等後方國民赤忱之結晶，戰局愈益熾烈危急，每次戰果之發表，均使吾等感激無已，但思歷次戰果中，我方飛機艦船等損傷亦屬不少，故極願盡其　力，裲充一機一艦，今日始得舉行命名典禮之光榮。吾人受此光榮，決意更加鞏固，願與第一綫將兵同為特攻隊，各守職責，加强戰力，在必勝之大信念下，努力工作，奮力作戰，不滅宿敵不止。」</p>
<p>中國方面代表致詞</p>
<p>陳彬龢氏代表中國方面致詞云：一今天是盟邦第四十屆海軍紀念日，正當大東亞戰爭最迫切的決戰階段，我們回顧四十年前日本海軍的光榮勝利，以及大東亞戰爭中日本海軍的勇戰偉績，不勝欽仰。可是，大東亞戰爭正愈趨愈烈，日本海軍所負的使命也愈益重大，我們站在盟友的立塲，站在問舟共濟的立塲，找們雖不能親赴前終協同作戰。我們應在後方盡其最火的協力。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭中最迫切需要的，精神方面是決勝的信念；物質方面是空軍飛機。盟邦海軍勇士的特攻精神，就是決勝信念的最高表現。精神方面已經充分具備，物質方面尤其補充空軍戰力，增加飛機生產，盟邦朝野正全力推進，減如日前鈴木首相召集航空機會社代表，舉行招待激勵會，勗勉民間以生產報國。我們實有同感。所以乘此海軍紀念日，呈獻飛機贈金，表示民間對於戰爭之協力，共同爭取戰爭勝利。」</p>
<p>湊武官長代表謝詞</p>
<p>日米內海軍大臣代表湊武官長謝詞如下：</p>
<p>「今日於決戰下之第四十屆海軍紀念日，舉行由各位熱忱獻納報國號飛機之命名典禮，本大臣引為無上欣慰。</p>
<p>今大東亞戰爭已臨皇國興廢關頭，達到空前重大危局。沖繩一帶敵我雙方戰鬥，日呈白熱化展開，我航空部隊呼應陸上守備隊之奮戰，不分晝夜，反覆死戰，擊潰敵人，大東亞戰爭之歸趨，將於此一役決定，尤以航空戰勝敗如何，更為重要因素。我海軍痛感航空兵力為擊滅來犯敵軍所絕對不可或缺者，現在克服敵機來襲本土等一切困難，努力提高質量，以必勝之信念，銳意增强。</p>
<p>當此重大時局，各位熱忱獻納多數優秀飛機，此直接可加强帝國海軍戰鬥力，誠感激無已。不日　等飛機將與將兵一體，在前綫活躍，深信必能感激各們之熱忱，於茲代表海軍深致謝意。」</p>

<h3>Japanese Special Attack Aircraft Form Three-Dimensional Formation, Launching a General Offensive Against Okinawa; Fierce Land Battles Between Naha and Shuri</h3>
<p>Nansei Islands Base, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the night of the 24th until the morning of the 25th, the Japanese Army Air Force has launched a special general offensive against Okinawa Island with all its might, employing superior and effective three-dimensional mobile tactics. The substantial replenishment of Japanese military strength, the grand scale, and the vigorous fighting spirit are unprecedented since the start of the Okinawa operation. Consequently, the effects of the offensive are extremely remarkable. Since the enemy landed on Okinawa, two months have passed. The Japanese land forces have repeatedly used small numbers to resist large enemy forces, inflicting enormous damage. Since the 18th, the main battlefields between Naha and Shuri have been completely filled with artillery fire and smoke. The ground battles are extremely fierce. The enemy's vanguard troops have gradually approached Shuri and the outskirts of Naha.</p>
<p>On the 24th, the enemy's naval strength consisted of six battleships, ten cruisers, fifty destroyers, one hundred and fifty large transport ships, and one hundred and forty small ones. Compared to the enemy's strength around the 20th, this represents an increase of approximately two times in destroyers and six times in transport ships. Also, on the afternoon of the 24th, an enemy mobile task force based on nine aircraft carriers appeared in the Tokunoshima area in two groups. The traffic of enemy ships near the island became increasingly frequent. At the same time, the severe low pressure along the coasts of the archipelago gradually intensified. This situation hinders the activity of the Japanese air force, while this unfavorable weather benefits the enemy. As a result, the situation in the Okinawa battle becomes increasingly perilous. At this time, the powerful aerial special general attack by the Japanese forces, centered on the "Shinto Brave Corps," is of profound significance. The various flight units, having conserved their strength and awaited their opportunity, launched simultaneous attacks when the weather cleared, fiercely approaching the Okinawa battlefield.</p>
<p>Waved Attacks on Three Airfields</p>
<p>In the first half of the night of the 24th, the Flying Dragon Bomber Squadron, under the cover of fighter squadrons, bravely deployed and launched a surprise attack on Iejima and the three airfields in the central and northern parts [of Okinawa]. Throughout the night, a small number of aircraft continued to carry out wave attacks to contain the enemy's three bases. Simultaneously, the Giretsu Airborne Unit, commanded by Captain Oyama, immediately began operations, forcibly landing at the two airfields in the central and northern parts [of Okinawa]. After jumping from the transport planes, the Giretsu Unit members immediately dispersed, targeting enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft had no camouflage or cover. The Giretsu Unit members then deployed the new weapons they carried. In a short time, enemy aircraft burst into flames, and the enemy troops were at a loss due to the sudden Japanese attack. The Japanese Giretsu Airborne Unit and the Flying Dragon Bomber Squadron wantonly ravaged the enemy airfields in the darkness, rendering the central and northern airfields completely unusable. At dawn on the 25th, the Japanese Flying Wing Special Attack Unit continued its assault, launching a heroic attack against enemy ships shelling the Japanese army off the coast of Kadena. The bombs carried by the Flying Dragon Special Attack Unit were irresistible to any ship. At that time, the enemy destroyers guarding the battleships fled in panic, some even colliding head-on with fleeing transport ships.</p>
<p>Shinto Brave Corps Using New Tactics</p>
<p>At the same time, the "Flying Swallow," "Broken Blades," "Yamabuki," "Kudan," "Hidden Light," "Eternal," "Demon Subduer," "Heavenly Punishment," and "Cherry Blossom" units of the Shinto Brave Special Attack Force, etc., all took off from [their] bases, forming several echelon formations, maintaining effective distance intervals and altitudes with each other, and fearlessly engaged in melee combat with a massive three-dimensional formation. This type of three-dimensional formation with multiple aircraft engaged in wave-like melee combat is a new tactic that [we] have never used before. The enemy forces were completely overwhelmed by the Japanese military might. The Shinto Brave Corps suffered no resistance from enemy fighters or anti-aircraft fire from enemy ships and were able to reach the target airspace. This was a first. The Flying Dragon Bomber Squadron and the Flying Dragon Special Attack Unit achieved significant battle results. From Kadena to Itoman and Awakawa, enemy transport ship wreckage was scattered everywhere. The great terror of the battle results achieved by the blood of Japanese youth exceeded Taiwanese expectations. As a result of this special general offensive, the enemy, relying on material resources, lost their combat power in an instant and became utterly disorganized. The tragic situation of the enemy forces is imaginable.</p>
<p>Japanese Giretsu Airborne Unit Achieved Great Battle Results; Nimitz Acknowledges Intense Attack</p>
<p>Forward Aviation Base, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Regarding the great battle results of the Giretsu Airborne Unit's surprise attack on Okinawa Island, the Okinawa field army has reported to [this] base that over 150 locations at the northern airfield were bombed, and fires were still burning as of 6:00 AM on the 25th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The landing of Japanese special attack aircraft on the airfields, causing the enemy to fall into a state of confusion, was only confirmed by a United Press dispatch from Guam until the 26th. The report also described the attack as follows: "While Japanese air force aircraft strafed at extremely low altitude, multiple Japanese twin-engine aircraft forcibly landed at the northern airfield. The Japanese soldiers all jumped out of the aircraft and ignited fires, bathed in moonlight." Meanwhile, a public statement from Admiral Nimitz's headquarters on the 27th stated that "Japanese land and sea forces have launched the most intense attacks on American forces on Okinawa Island over the past few weeks. The attacks by Japanese special attack units are the most intense since the start of this war," reflecting the fighting spirit of the Japanese special attack units and air force.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Navy Day; Governor Hao's Speech</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Today is the 40th Navy Day of [our] allied nation, Japan. To arouse the public and encourage his subordinates, and to foster a thorough understanding and awareness of Navy Day in order to uplift the spirit of decisive battle and complete the mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia, Governor Hao delivered a speech, the gist of which was: "Today is the 40th Navy Day of our allied nation, Japan. On this day of the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, as we commemorate the Navy Day of our allied nation, Japan, we should develop a new attitude and new goals, strengthen China's naval defense lines, accelerate the development of youth naval units, and instill in the public knowledge of naval warfare. With scientific intelligence, patriotic fervor, and the united strength of the entire nation, we should mobilize all of our manpower, resources, finances, and intellect, to pool our collective wisdom and efforts, sweep away the past corruption of our nation's navy, and complete the iron wall of participation in the war. All of my compatriots should be aware of the great significance [of this day], encourage each other with our allied nation, Japan, and quickly complete the era's mission of revitalizing Asia and defeating Britain and America."</p>
<h3>U.S. Eighth Air Force Commander Transferred to Pacific Theater</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Washington, Doolittle, former commander of the U.S. Eighth Air Force stationed in Britain, returned to Washington yesterday. It is reported that he will receive a new appointment and be sent to the Pacific Theater.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters Adjusts Organization</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to strengthen the organization and consolidate the party foundation, the Chinese Nationalist Party has restored the election system for party headquarters at all levels. Elections for party headquarters at all levels below the provincial and municipal levels have been completed sequentially, and elections for party headquarters in various provinces and municipalities (special municipalities) will also begin. Recently, the central party headquarters has adjusted the organization of party headquarters. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters recently received instructions from the central headquarters and promulgated a simplified plan for strengthening party affairs and party headquarters organizations, first straightening out the internal organization. It is reported that the original one office and three departments will now be simplified in accordance with the central plan, and reorganized into three departments: General Affairs, Organization, and Public Opinion Research. Except for the Organization Department, which will remain unchanged, the original Chief Secretary's Office will be renamed the General Affairs Department, incorporating the affairs of the Propaganda Department, with the former Chief Secretary serving as the department director. The newly established Public Training Department will specialize in public training affairs, with the former Director of the Social Affairs Department serving as the director. It is reported that this adjustment has been approved by the concurrent chairman and will be implemented from June 1st and reported to the central government for record.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Urgent Need to Solve the People's Food Problem</h3>
<p>We are currently in a decisive period of war. Everything should prioritize the victory of the decisive battle. Therefore, in the process of the decisive battle, in the process of striving for victory, we must concentrate all our strength. Under this major premise, we cannot help but raise the most serious issue of people's livelihood: the people's food problem. The price of rice on the black market has already risen above 20 [yuan per dou], and the prices of other essential goods for people's livelihood have followed suit. Not to mention that the majority of ordinary people are already on the verge of financial ruin, even highly paid salary earners are also stuck in a dire situation. Moreover, there are two major characteristics of this round of price increases that deserve concern: First, spatially speaking, this time, unlike in the past, the price fluctuations were not led by large cities. On the contrary, it was the soaring rice prices in rural areas and small cities that led the price surge, which spread to all regions. Second, in terms of timing, this round of skyrocketing prices, centered on food, began in the early stages of the lean season, which is different from regular cyclical price fluctuations. Instead, it is a continuous and increasing surge in prices. From these two perspectives, we cannot help but worry that: First, the scope of the population affected by price manipulation is extremely broad, almost covering the Jiangzhe and the Pacified Regions, and affecting various salary and wage earners. As a result, it will clearly affect the "combat effectiveness of materials in the Chinese [Occupied] Territories," and inevitably affect policies such as "concentrating national strength to cooperate with Japan to complete the war."</p>
<p>Therefore, we must loudly appeal: if we do not urgently seek to solve the problems of people's livelihood in the Pacified Regions, especially if we do not urgently seek to solve the food problem in the Pacified Regions, then any "cooperation in participating in the decisive battle" and any "material combat effectiveness" policies will lose their practical significance. Today, anyone who speaks of completing the Greater East Asia War must first seek to solve the problem of people's livelihood!</p>
<p>In fact, the problems in the Pacified Regions today cannot be solved by the strength of any one party alone. This has already been proven by the political and economic realities of the Pacified Regions over the past four or five years. Therefore, as we demand the rapid resolution of the food problem today, we must request that the responsible authorities on both the Chinese and Japanese sides, view the situation from a broad and long-term perspective, and consider the common goal of China completing the war. They must investigate and research, without any concealment, exactly how the food problem in the Pacified Regions today arose. After thorough investigation and research, they will inevitably discover the root cause of the problem, and then seek solutions in a "pragmatic way" (we must especially emphasize these four words) and devise practical relief measures. We constantly speak of grasping people's hearts and Chinese-Japanese cooperation. Now, solving the food problem is the most important test of this common aspiration. If we can solve this increasingly critical food problem today, then the issues of grasping people's hearts and Chinese-Japanese cooperation will all be readily resolved, achieving satisfactory success.</p>
<p>While the Chinese and Japanese authorities are investigating, researching, and devising thorough solutions, we first hope that the municipal authorities will quickly formulate partial and palliative countermeasures. As far as we know, Huaihai Province has had bumper harvests of miscellaneous grains and has considerable surpluses. The authorities may consider finding ways to purchase these [grains] and quickly distribute them to the general public in Shanghai, in order to slightly alleviate the immediate crisis. We believe that the current soaring grain prices are mainly due to the fact that the supply routes are blocked, and, on the other hand, that the distribution of food is inadequate, leading to market speculators manipulating the market. This cannot be ignored. If the amount of miscellaneous grains distributed per household can be increased first, it can somewhat alleviate the severity of the food shortage problem, while waiting for the most appropriate solution through the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese authorities.</p>
<h3>Small Number of B-29 Aircraft Attacked Kyushu Yesterday; Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Intercepted at the Kanmon Straits</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Starting at 0:20 AM and lasting until 1:20 AM on the 27th, approximately eight enemy B-29 aircraft, in formations of one or two, infiltrated via the Bungo Channel, operating in the Kunisaki Peninsula of Oita Prefecture, the western sea area of Yamaguchi Prefecture, and the Kanmon Straits area. They dropped naval mines, and from 1:20 AM to about 2:30 AM, they gradually departed via the Bungo Channel. Another group of approximately eight enemy aircraft infiltrated the southern part of Kagoshima Prefecture from 0:50 AM to 1:50 AM, heading north from the western sea area of Kagoshima Prefecture, circling over the western sea area of Nagasaki Prefecture, the northern coastal area of Saga Prefecture, and the vicinity of Hakata in Fukuoka Prefecture. After dropping naval mines, they headed south through the central part of Oita Prefecture, and departed via the Bungo Channel from 1:20 AM onwards. Japanese aircraft fiercely intercepted [them] in the skies over the Kanmon Straits, confirming the downing of two B-29 aircraft. In addition, one B-29 aircraft infiltrated the southern part of the Osumi Peninsula at 4:50 AM, heading north along the eastern coast of Kyushu, operating in the Kunisaki Peninsula of Oita Prefecture and Yamaguchi Prefecture, and departing southward from Hiroshima Prefecture at around 5:50 AM. Furthermore, one B-29 aircraft infiltrated the Bungo Channel at 11:00 AM, circling in the Kunisaki Peninsula of Oita Prefecture and the Kanmon Straits area, then operating in the Sea of Japan, and subsequently departing through the western part of Yamaguchi Prefecture. It dropped bombs in Oita Prefecture, but there was no damage on the ground. In addition, two enemy B-29 patrol aircraft operated near the Goto Islands in the Korean Strait for approximately two hours starting at 11:00 AM, then departed southward.</p>
<h3>Airstrikes on the Japanese Mainland as a Diversionary Operation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy air force stationed in the Marianas continued its attacks on the night of the 23rd. On the night of the 25th, 250 enemy aircraft raided Tokyo again, dropping incendiary bombs, causing considerable damage on the Japanese side. It is observed that the enemy's intention in this raid is to divert the Japanese side's continuous aerial attacks on Okinawa since mid-April. Therefore, they are using their main force to carry out tactical bombing of the Japanese air bases in the Kyushu and Chugoku regions. According to the consistent operational mission of the enemy B-29 bomber squadrons, strategic bombing of the mainland is almost at a standstill. However, due to the heroic fighting of the Japanese army and air force on Okinawa Island, they know that attempting to divert the Japanese army by carrying out localized tactical bombing of the Kyushu and Chugoku regions is impossible. Therefore, they are returning the B-29 aircraft to their original operational mission, taking strategic bombing against Tokyo and other major cities in Japan. The two strategic bombing raids against Nagoya on the 14th and 17th were the first steps in this reconversion. Their conversion aims to destroy the Japanese production capacity, so as to shake the war will of the Japanese people. The result is that the diversionary operation for the decisive battle of Okinawa is very clear. The Japanese and Americans will take a decisive approach to this desperate war, and the very cruel battle must unfold, and in the current stage of the decisive battle, the conflict will not be limited to one small area. The enemy's offensive will be targeted at all means and methods to attack the Japanese mainland. Because the enemy is making a last-ditch effort, the conditions and strength of the B-29 in the Marianas are reinforced on the base, and it is highly likely that there will be a 24-hour bombing run.</p>
<h3>University Students and the Special Attack Corps</h3>
<p>Dialogue: Fleet Reporting Department: Lieutenant Matsumoto; This Newspaper: Reporter</p>
<p>Starting with University Student Life at Tokyo Imperial University</p>
<p>Reporter: Today, we are delighted to celebrate the 40th Navy Day of Japan. Remembering the glorious victory of the Japanese Navy forty years ago, and recalling the current brave fighting of the naval officers and soldiers, we feel very excited.</p>
<p>The current Special Attack Corps of the Japanese Navy embodies the "spirit of the Japanese Navy." Most of the members of the Special Attack Corps are graduates of various universities, many of whom are classmates from Tokyo Imperial University. Lieutenant Matsumoto is a senior from Tokyo Imperial University and is now responsible for naval reporting. He must have a deep understanding of the special attack spirit of his former classmates. Please share your thoughts on this aspect.</p>
<p>Matsumoto: Tokyo Imperial University is indeed something to be missed. The two rows of ginkgo trees lining the Akamon Gate and the main gate are now full of new green leaves. Recently, we have often heard the names of our classmates who used to visit us under the green shade of those ginkgo trees in newspapers or on the radio. It turns out that they have joined the Special Attack Corps, which naturally makes me deeply respectful of them, and also strengthens my determination to serve the country.</p>
<p>Their decisive actions, transcending the threshold of life and death, can be said to be inevitable. In student days, people might say that current students are not passionate enough, or they need to study harder, etc., because they always feel that there are shortcomings in domestic affairs and world issues at that time, so they doubt and think. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the shadow in the hearts of university students has been swept away. Everyone has discovered a grand direction, and everyone has embarked on this passion, which can be said to be a belief that forgets the self. This is a driving force, and it has developed more and more with the progress of the war. They are not afraid of facing difficulties, because they are fighting for the motherland, so they see it very plainly.</p>
<p>Reporter: The spirit of Japanese youth is truly admirable, but the general Chinese youth may not fully understand the spirit of the Special Attack Corps. Please explain it in more detail, Lieutenant Matsumoto.</p>
<p>Matsumoto: The special attack spirit of Japanese youth is nothing beyond the ordinary. Those who did not work hard in coaching classes in student days, when they were called up to the military, did not need any explanation. They were happily determined to completely dedicate their lives to His Majesty, and sacrifice themselves for the great righteousness of the country. How was this will cultivated? Although there are various factors, in a nutshell, it can be said that because the Japanese Emperor is supreme, the spirit of martyrdom of the Japanese nation to defend Japan and protect East Asia is combined with the original enthusiasm of the youth, which creates the spirit of the Special Attack Corps. Therefore, the first to propose attacking with the Special Attack Corps were also young people. After the Battle of Solomon, although the extensive battle results continued, to defeat the enemy's material quantity, it was necessary to use special attacks of "one plane, one ship," and "one death kills a hundred." Therefore, there were suggestions from the Special Attack Corps, which were implemented.</p>
<p>The Special Attack Spirit and the Traditional Spirit</p>
<p>Reporter: We believe that the spirit of Bushido still flows in the blood of Japanese youth. Now, at the juncture of the rise and fall of the nation, this latent spirit of Bushido has naturally reappeared. I think this spirit is in line with the spirit of "Seven Lives to Repay the Country" of Kusunoki Masashige. The authority on Bushido in medieval Japan, "Hagakure," once said: "The so-called Bushido is to find the place to die. In places of life and death, it is better to die early. There is nothing to consider in detail. You must move forward with a firm will." The general idea is that you must find the place to die. The spirit of the Special Attack Corps members today, who sacrifice the small self to contribute to the greater self, is in line with the spirit of Bushido in "Hagakure." Individuals transcend the threshold of life and death, and contribute their individual death to the life of the nation. This is the attitude that youth should have. Please also explain the connection between the special attack spirit of Japanese youth and the traditional spirit, Lieutenant Matsumoto.</p>
<p>Matsumoto: The so-called Japanese spirit is difficult to explain simply and clearly. However, to summarize, the Japanese spirit is based on the spirit of protecting Japan. When we read the history of the Japanese gods, we feel that there is a thorough theory of human beings and the world, as well as the truth of the universe. Later, although Japan was influenced by Chinese Confucian culture after the Sui and Tang Dynasties, and indirectly influenced by Buddhism from China, it absorbed the essence of Confucian and Buddhist culture. Therefore, Japan's view of the universe, the world, and life was enriched. By the time of the Warring States period in Japan, it encountered a great trial, and completed the seamless Bushido. Of course, it can be said that the Japanese special attack spirit inherits the traditional Japanese spirit.</p>
<p>Reporter: Lieutenant Matsumoto's description of the Japanese spirit has the very specific spirits of "sacrificing oneself to achieve benevolence" and "giving up one's life for righteousness." I think this is also in line with the spirit of the Special Attack Corps. Furthermore, in Buddhist thought, there is a kind of "impermanence" that transcends life and death. Because this kind of Zen practice is very common in Japan, it probably also has an influence on the spirit of the Special Attack Corps. In short, the spirit of the Special Attack Corps can be said to be the highest manifestation of the strong vitality of youth, which is close to the Chinese saying "If I hear the Dao in the morning, I can die in the evening."</p>
<p>Matsumoto: Not only is it related to the spirit of Confucianism and Buddhism, but Lao Tzu's idea of non-action but non-inaction also has an impact on the Special Attack Corps spirit. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Establishes Agricultural Improvement Zones</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Improvement Committee, in order to actively promote agricultural production in addition to the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station and Seedling Farm, has established provincial agricultural improvement zones to handle trials and promote the propagation of superior seeds and seedlings. Cooperatives in other regions are transitioning from consumption to production, establishing technicians, and their affiliated production increase groups are serving as township agricultural advancement associations. Sixty-four such associations have been established, with the aim of enriching rural agricultural production through self-initiated planning.</p>
<h3>The Suzhou-Shanghai Highway is About to Begin Construction and Repair</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch): Regarding the construction and repair of the Suzhou-Shanghai Highway, the Provincial Construction General Engineering Office has been actively progressing, and preparations are largely complete. Construction can begin soon. Concerning the repair of the entire road surface, the provincial and Shanghai municipal authorities previously agreed that the provincial section would be repaired by the Provincial Construction Authorities, and the Shanghai section would be repaired by the Shanghai Municipal Government's Road Repair Office. Upon completion of the work, the entire road can be quickly restored to traffic. Sun Qingcai, Director-General of the Provincial Government Construction and concurrently Director of the Engineering Office, traveled to Shanghai yesterday to coordinate various engineering matters with the Shanghai Municipality.</p>
<h3>Hebei Implements Student Diligence and Public Service</h3>
<p>Beiping, 27th (Zhongtian News Agency dispatch): In view of the urgency of the current situation, the Hebei Provincial Government, in order to uplift the war consciousness of Chinese youth and students and assist in the production of emergency materials, mobilized students from secondary schools and above to implement diligence and public service, achieving excellent results. In order to further enhance these effects, the Provincial Baoding Normal School and Xingtai Normal School will each send 50 students to a certain coal mine for the fourth time, from the 25th of this month to the 24th of June, for diligence and public service.</p>
<h3>Responding to Long-Term War: Japan Has Ample Strength, says Director of the U.S. Foreign Economic Survey Bureau</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to the Washington Gazette, Mr. Grau, Director of the U.S. Foreign Economic Survey Bureau, said yesterday that Japan has sufficient resources to cope with a long-term war, as within the so-called "inner regions" of Japan proper, Taiwan, Korea, and Manchukuo, they possess a large number of resources and manufacturing plants. The area currently occupied by our Allied forces is less than 7% of the area Japan occupied in the East Indies, Malaya, and the Philippine Islands in 1941-42. Furthermore, if we consider the air war against Japan, Japan began its large-scale and extensive industrial development decades ago. Japan's various "inner regions" certainly contain large industries capable of producing enough material to supply consumption for months after the war, and possess abundant basic resources that can sustain large-scale production indefinitely. In addition, Japan has a large production of synthetic oil and possesses a large number of tungsten, lead, zinc, and other various metals. Most importantly, Japan has enough food to feed its people.</p>
<h3>Pétain Scheduled for Trial</h3>
<p>Bern, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to news from Paris, members of the current French "Resistance Movement" and prison guards are taking strict precautions, fearing that Marshal Pétain will commit suicide before the trial. The date for Pétain's trial has recently been set for July 15th.</p>
<h3>Czechoslovakia to Demand Cession of German Territory</h3>
<p>Bern, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch): News received indirectly from here: Circles in London believe that the Czech government will soon demand the cession of 1,000 square kilometers of German territory inhabited by people of the Lusatian Wends and Winter districts to Czechoslovakia. Prague Radio broadcasted that Chairman Stalin had exchanged memorandums with President Beneš on the matter, and that a temporary headquarters of the "Wendish National Committee" has been established in Prague. At the same time, the radio station informed the Soviet commander that it hoped to distinguish between Slavic and Germanic peoples in the Lusatian Wendish and Winter districts. The Lusatian Wendish and Winter districts extend from the Czech border directly north of Prague, through the city of Bautzen in Saxony (50 kilometers east of Dresden), all the way to Cottbus (100 kilometers northeast of Berlin).</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Orders the Economic Bureau to Actively Adjust Valuations and Strictly Enforce Price Controls with Relevant Authorities</h3>
<p>Recently, commodity prices have skyrocketed, and all parties are paying close attention. The Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that past valuation work has been mostly passive, relying on applications from trade associations for review, and that meeting times are often far apart, resulting in valuations that rarely reflect reality, making compliance difficult for both sides, has learned that in order to rectify this measure, it has stipulated a new valuation method, ordering the Economic Bureau to actively adjust valuations to make them reasonable, and to strictly enforce price controls with relevant authorities. Key points:</p>
<p>*   The cost of major commodities should be investigated at any time. In addition to applications from trade associations for review, price limits should be drafted based on the results of the investigation and submitted to the Valuation Committee for deliberation and implementation.</p>
<p>*   For major edible agricultural products, in order to align with the actual situation, the competent authorities may first assess and implement price limits, and then submit them to the Valuation Committee for retroactive approval.</p>
<p>Furthermore, major commodity trade associations originally bear the responsibility of supervising the business of their members, but in fact, only a few trade associations can implement supervision. In order to prevent members of various industries from illegally manipulating market prices, the Ministry also ordered the Economic Bureau to earnestly supervise the business of trade association members and strictly prohibit non-industry personnel from illegal trading, in order to suppress the sharp rise in commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Valuation Committee to Meet Today</h3>
<p>In view of the sharp rise in commodity prices in this city, which is even worse than in the past, the Municipal Economic Bureau, after sending investigators for covert investigation, found that while there are bound to be special circumstances, there are still general illegal merchants who are hoarding and manipulating market prices. Therefore, stricter measures will be taken to crack down on and punish hoarding merchants and will be strictly enforced. Furthermore, in accordance with Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry's order to strengthen the valuation of commodities, the Municipal Commodity Price Valuation Committee has been instructed to re-evaluate prices as soon as possible. It is learned that the committee is scheduled to convene a committee meeting today (28th) to evaluate and approve new price limits based on the latest market conditions. In addition to evaluating and approving the prices of major commodities, price limits will also be approved for minor commodities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Day Lecture Continued Yesterday</h3>
<p>To commemorate the 40th anniversary of Japanese Navy Day, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Press Association held a second lecture yesterday (27th) at the Dahua Theater. General Jiang Xiyuan, Principal of the Central Naval Academy, gave a lecture, and the Municipal Propaganda Department also sent personnel to attend. No less than a thousand students from major middle schools in the city attended the lecture. The meeting was chaired by Chen Riping, Managing Director of the Press Association Branch, who first reported on the significance of commemorating Allied Navy Day, followed by General Jiang's lecture, which lasted 45 minutes. Afterwards, the Hua Ying film "Don't Forget Tonight" was screened, and the meeting adjourned at 12 noon.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Address</h3>
<p>In his address, Chairman Chen Riping said, "Today is the 40th anniversary of Allied Japanese Navy Day. Forty years ago, in the 38th year of the Meiji era in Japan, the Russian and Russian armies fought fiercely in the Sea of Japan, and Japan destroyed the Tsarist Russian fleet. The Japanese Navy has always had the belief of certain victory and fought bravely. Since defeating Tsarist Russia, the Japanese Navy has become increasingly stronger. Now, in this Greater East Asia War, it is particularly characterized by the spirit of special attacks, annihilating the British and American navies and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. We deeply admire this traditional spirit of Japan."</p>
<h3>General Jiang's Speech</h3>
<p>In his speech, General Jiang Xiyuan said, "Everyone is deeply aware of the Greater East Asia War situation, and the Allied news agencies have also published many reports on the war situation. The current development of the war situation can be described as ever-changing. Allied General Takahashi has explained the future of the war situation in detail, so there is no need to repeat it. The First World War had a close impact economically. In this war, whether on land, sea, or air, it includes both political and economic aspects. Therefore, we cannot regard the Greater East Asia War as a combat. This is a war of the entire nation.</p>
<p>In the national war, history and geography are closely linked, so China and Japan can never get rid of this point. In the future, we should not only cooperate with the Former Opportunity and work together, but also unite in the rear to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. In Pan-Asianism, the concept of the unity of the East Asian nations has long been clear, such as 'Each loves its own country, loves its neighbors, and defends East Asia together.' Therefore, the Asian yellow race must be closely united. Otherwise, if China and Japan do not cooperate sincerely and deviate from their positions, they will be subject to the dictates of fate in the future. Although brothers have quarreled in the past, they must jointly resist foreign insults today. Therefore, we should review the past and create the future. I hope that we will deeply understand this and strive for the fate of the entire nation."</p>
<h3>Two United Police Officers Executed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Police officers Li Hongxin and Du Zhiping of the Huashan Road Branch of the Police Bureau, who used their authority to extort money from the people and then pushed the victims into the river, were found guilty by the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court, sentenced to death, and approved for execution by Chairman Chen of the National Government. The execution was carried out at the "Stone Arch" in the Racecourse Jie Xiaofang Square on the morning of the 27th. The crowd was extremely crowded. In order to maintain order, the police bureau maintained strict security around the racecourse. Supervising Judge Gao Weiqu, Clerk Xie Jingsong, and senior officials of the Supervising Police Bureau arrived at the scene one after another. At 9:40, the two criminals, Li and Du, were slowly driven to the execution ground from the New World entrance of the racecourse by judicial police. The prisoners were escorted down. Du was wearing a blue uniform on his upper body and gray pants on his lower body. Li was wearing a yellow uniform. After the supervising officer asked for their names, ages, and native places, verifying their identities, he ordered the two criminals to kneel down at 9:55. Members of the Police Bureau's Special Affairs Team carried out the execution. Du and Li were shot and fell to the ground one after another. The corpses were collected by personnel sent by Pushan Villa.</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices Soared Suddenly Last Week</h3>
<p>The financial and commercial conditions in this city have fluctuated drastically in the past week. Speculators are very active, and the relevant authorities are paying close attention to this serious issue concerning people's livelihoods and public order. After the Central Reserve Bank issued gold certificates, the gold market tended to stabilize, and trading was not as rampant as before. The first four days of last week were still in a state of calm, but on Friday, a surprising surge occurred, jumping by forty to fifty points. People were agitated, and purchases became more intense. Silver followed suit and rose, and public prices also rose in step. Since the beginning of the week until Friday, Hua shares have been rising steadily, with smooth sailing. The three popular stocks of Meiya, Wing On, and the cotton mill all rose to saturation points every day. Small and medium-sized stocks, whether industrial stocks, textile stocks, real estate stocks, cultural stocks, chemical industry stocks, or pharmaceutical stocks, mostly reached their daily limit. The daily turnover increased by more than double compared to the past, with a strong demand exceeding supply. The prosperity was unprecedented. On Saturday, the market saw a slight setback in the half-day, but the market was firmly grounded and the money supply eased, with more floating capital. As for industry and commerce, prices are soaring across the board. Rice prices have more than doubled compared to the previous week, and the rise in miscellaneous grains is also severe. Oil and sugar have both soared, and purchases are still difficult. Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and candles have all risen in unison, and the factory selling prices have been raised significantly, especially the price tags on cotton textiles, socks, and undershirts have changed even more. The lives of ordinary citizens have reached the most critical juncture. It is hoped that the economic and related enforcement authorities will quickly take effective measures to suppress commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Japanese Education Research Institute Officially Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Japanese Education Research Institute of Shanghai Special Municipality held its founding ceremony yesterday afternoon at the Kangle Restaurant. Zhou, the mayor, was represented by Dai Yingfu, Director of the Bureau of Education, and Secretary Dai Buheng, and Minister Tsuchida was represented by Investigator Takayama.</p>
<h3>Preparations</h3>
<p>The chairman, Dai Yingfu, first reported on the preparations, saying: "This association has been preparing for more than a month, and has finally achieved it. I am extremely grateful for the assistance of Mr. Ueno and Investigator Takayama. The significance of the Education Bureau hosting this institute is that anyone who wants to study Japanese will be able to conduct further research. Whether they are teachers from public or private universities or middle schools, regardless of their Chinese or Japanese nationality, they are all members of this institute. Among them, not only teachers can participate, but also those who are interested in Japanese studies can join. The Education Bureau contacted various parties based on this proposition and began preparations. With the enthusiastic support of people from both countries, it finally succeeded."</p>
<h3>Mayor's Admonition</h3>
<p>Next, the Education Bureau Director Dai Yingfu gave an admonition on behalf of Mayor Zhou, saying: "In the Eastern region, there is the great existence of Eastern culture. We must promote the spirit of this Eastern Wangdao culture, and only people from China and Japan can work together. Japanese people are very focused on studying Chinese culture, and at the same time, there are quite a few Chinese people who are willing to study Japanese culture. The research institute is formed by the gathering of people from China and Japan. Chinese and Japanese comrades can introduce Japanese culture to China as much as possible in this research institute in the future, and Chinese culture can also be introduced to Japan. At the same time, its advantages can be promoted even more. This is the second point. Comrades from the two countries have been working together on the Sino-Japanese Century Plan for seven years. During this period, we can say that there are still many shortcomings to be reviewed. To make up for this defect, it is only with the efforts of educational people from both countries that this will not be in vain. I hope that the research colleagues will not only think about creating a new Eastern culture, but also work hard for the future of China and Japan, and create lasting peace in East Asia. The significance of establishing this institute will be great. I hope that everyone will redouble their efforts to complete the mission of this institute."</p>
<p>Subsequently, Investigator Takayama delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Tsuchida, with many words of encouragement. Then, the rules of the institute were discussed and passed, and finally, Chinese and Japanese teachers from various schools expressed their opinions one after another. The meeting adjourned after about an hour.</p>
<h3>Statistics on the Types of Businesses of Banks and Native Banks</h3>

<h3>Ocean Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yaxin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, in commemoration of Japan's 40th Naval Day, is holding an Ocean Art Exhibition at the Dalu Gallery on the fourth floor of No. 17 Wai Street. Over sixty works are on display, categorized as: watercolor, oil painting, pastel, and sketch. These were selected for exhibition by outstanding Chinese and Japanese artists after deliberation and appraisal by the Ocean Art Exhibition Committee. Therefore, the displayed works are all masterpieces of the time.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited the venue on Naval Day, the guests were unusually crowded, each focusing their attention on appreciating these vibrant works.</p>
<p>The subjects of these paintings mainly popularize ocean ideas and related production, transportation, and fishing. Japanese artist Isao Ishioka's three watercolors – "Fishing Boat," "Jianghai Customs," and "Naval Bricks" – depict ocean life. His brushstrokes are very vigorous, expressing the complex situations on the ocean surface with simple colors, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Komitsu Oki's "Riding the Long Wind" uses somber colors to enhance the tragic atmosphere. The entire painting uses varying degrees of dark blue, with a faint yellow hue revealing the outline of a mountain, especially highlighting the desolation of the night. Yoshihide Matsubayashi's "Sichuan Road Bridge Scenery" is a realistic work that shows the many aspects of Shanghai life. On the bridge, there are a dozen or so pedestrians of various types, rickshaws, and two tricycles, one of which is being pulled across the bridge by a military coolie, with a porter helping him push from behind. The painter's use of multi-colored brushstrokes emphasizes the complexity of the painting, which cannot but make us admire the artist's talent and skill.</p>
<p>What surprised the reporter was a sailboat painting called "Evening Wind," painted in light ink by Yoson Miyamura. It is very close to the style of Chinese painting, light and free, almost like a work by a Song Dynasty artist. However, "Junks" (the Chinese translation is帆船 sailboat), entirely in the Western style, by Ichigyo Ogawa, is different from the previous painting. The parallel sailboats are expressed in varying shades and a variety of colors, and even show the fabric texture on the sails. From this delicate technique, we can see how carefully the artist handled his subject.</p>
<p>Paintings depicting ocean and battle scenes include: Komitsu Oki's "Great Air and Sea Battle off Okinawa Coast"; Asanosuke Tanoue's "Fighting Spirit"; Kazuyoshi Asai's "Majesty"; Kenji Ito's "Battleship," "Annihilation," and "Raising the Warship Flag"; Mansheng Xue's "Battleship Locks the Four Seas," and so on. These are all very powerful works. Saburo Saigo's "Sea" displays the beauty and magnificence of the ocean with bright and somber colors. Kazuyoshi Asai's "Morning of the Pacific" has beautiful colors, with the red sun peeking through the clouds, implying profound meaning.</p>
<p>Chinese artists participating include Erqiang Lu, Meisun Zhang, and Ziyu Wang. Erqiang Lu's large-scale oil painting "Preparations Before Going to Sea" has excellent subject matter, color, and technique. In the picture, several fishermen are knotting nets facing the sea, showing their anxiety and anticipation. This clever method shows the author's extraordinary accomplishment. Another pastel painting by the same author, "Roar," has successful color and composition. Meisun Zhang's three watercolors, "Huangpu River," "Xuanwu Lake," and "West Lake," show how well the author uses color to express the subject matter, from the commotion of the first painting to the tranquility of the latter two.</p>
<p>This art exhibition opened on the 25th and closes on the 30th. Exhibition hours are from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. If citizens want to learn about the ocean scene, come and visit early to avoid missing this rare opportunity.</p>
<h3>Naming Ceremony for Planes Donated by Chinese and Japanese Citizens Held Yesterday; Japanese Naval Minister's Representative, Naval Attaché Minato, Names Planes</h3>
<p>The naming ceremony for planes donated by Chinese and Japanese citizens was solemnly held at the Shanghai Shrine in Hongkou yesterday morning at 9:30 AM. Attendees included Naval Attaché Minato, representative of the Japanese Naval Minister, Chairman of the Naming Committee Colonel Matsushima, representatives of the donors from the Chinese side, including Chen Binhe, President of this newspaper, and from the Japanese side, Kaoru Toyota, Chairman of the Shanghai Xingya Patriotic Society, and Chuzaburo Nakajima, Head of the Shanghai Resident Group, as well as guests and students from the Japanese Fifth National School, totaling several hundred people. At the beginning of the naming ceremony, the Japanese Navy Band came to the venue to play music. After the ceremony was performed as prescribed, Chuzaburo Nakajima and Chen Binhe, the two national donor representatives, delivered speeches successively. Naval Attaché Minato, representing the Naval Minister, named the planes and issued letters of appreciation. Then, Chairman of the Naming Committee Colonel Matsushima delivered a speech, stating: "Thanks to the sincerity of the Chinese and Japanese people, we are able to hold this naming ceremony for the donated aircraft, and I am extremely pleased. I would like to express my deepest gratitude here." Finally, the whole venue shouted "Banzai," and the ceremony concluded at about 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Speech by the Japanese Representative</p>
<p>Chuzaburo Nakajima, representing the Japanese donors, said: "Today, at the naming ceremony for the donated aircraft, I would like to offer a word to His Excellency the Naval Minister's Agent on behalf of the donors. The aircraft named today are the crystallization of the sincere patriotism of us people in the rear. The increasingly fierce and critical war situation and the announcement of each battle result have left us endlessly grateful. But thinking about the damage to our aircraft and ships in the previous battles, we sincerely wish to do our best to supplement them with one more plane and one more ship. Today, we have the honor of holding this naming ceremony. Receiving this honor, we are determined to consolidate it further and are willing to join the soldiers on the front line as special attack forces, guarding our duties, strengthening our combat power, working hard, and fighting bravely with the great belief of certain victory, and not stopping until the destruction of our old enemy."</p>
<p>Speech by the Chinese Representative</p>
<p>Chen Binhe, representing the Chinese side, said: "Today is the 40th Naval Anniversary of our ally, at a time when the Greater East Asia War has reached its most urgent and decisive stage. We look back on the glorious victory of the Japanese Navy forty years ago, and the brave and great achievements of the Japanese Navy in the Greater East Asia War, and we cannot help but admire them. However, the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more intense, and the mission borne by the Japanese Navy is becoming more and more important. Standing in the position of allies, standing in the position of sharing the same boat, we cannot personally go to the front line to cooperate in combat. We should do our utmost to cooperate in the rear.</p>
<p>What is most urgently needed in the Greater East Asia War is the belief in victory in terms of spirit, and air force aircraft in terms of materials. The special attack spirit of the Allied naval warriors is the highest expression of the belief in victory. The spiritual aspect is already fully equipped, and the material aspect especially needs to supplement the air force's combat power and increase aircraft production. The Allied authorities and people are fully promoting it, as evidenced by the recent meeting convened by Prime Minister Suzuki with representatives of aviation companies to hold a reception and encourage them to serve the country through production. We truly share this feeling. Therefore, on this Naval Anniversary, we are presenting aircraft donation money to express the cooperation of the people for the war and jointly strive for victory in the war."</p>
<p>Thank You Speech by Naval Attaché Minato</p>
<p>The thank-you speech by Naval Attaché Minato, representative of the Naval Minister, is as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, on the 40th Naval Anniversary under the decisive battle, I am extremely pleased that the naming ceremony of the Patriotic Aircraft donated with enthusiasm by all of you is being held.</p>
<p>The current Greater East Asia War has reached an unprecedentedly critical situation at a time when the rise and fall of the empire are at stake. The battle between the enemy and us in the Okinawa area is unfolding in a white-hot manner. Our aviation units are responding to the brave fighting of the ground defense forces, fighting to the death day and night, and defeating the enemy. The outcome of the Greater East Asia War will be determined by this battle. The success or failure of the air war is an even more important factor. Our Navy keenly feels that air power is absolutely indispensable for destroying invading enemy forces. We are now overcoming all difficulties, such as enemy aircraft attacking the mainland, and striving to improve quality with the belief of certain victory and diligently strengthening.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, all of you have enthusiastically donated many excellent aircraft, which can directly strengthen the combat power of the Imperial Navy. I am truly grateful. Before long, these aircraft will be active on the front lines together with the soldiers, and I am confident that they will be able to appreciate the enthusiasm of all of you. Here, on behalf of the Navy, I express my deepest gratitude."</p>
