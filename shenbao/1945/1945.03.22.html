<h3>日空軍連續隨處追撃　敵機動部隊避退　空母及艦船沉毀達十二艘</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日大本營二十一日下午三時三十分發表：敵機動部隊二十日晨以來，向南方避退，日航空部隊急追該敵，刻在擴大戰果。二十日收獲之戰果中，截止現在，經判明者如次：擊沉正規航空母艦一艘，擊毀正規航空母艦一艘。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電日航空部隊，十八日晨以來，業將出現於九州東方海面之敵機動部隊完全擊退，自是日黎明以果敢之先發制攻擊，計擊沉敵正規空母一艘，擊毀空母八艘，在大本營發表此項戰果後，仍然繼續攻擊中。自十九日迄現在，除經已發表之戰果外，航空部隊復又擊沉正規空母一艘，巡洋艦一艘。二十日下午，特攻隊出動，展開必死必中之攻擊，使大型空母二艘發生大火，其中一艘確已沉沒。嗣後，日航空部隊繼續實行夜間攻繫，據偵察機偵察報吿，攻擊之海面漂有油類及其他漂流物甚多，此次在十八日以來連續攻擊中，未經判明之戰果，尙有擊毀艦型不詳者四艘，故現在之綜合戰果，合計空母及其他艦船，最少有十二艘左右被擊沉或擊毀。日軍航空部隊二十日夜間及二十一日畫，並連續隨處猛攻敵機動部隊，戰果頗堪期待。</p>
<h3>攻撃敵機動部隊　日陸海軍機戰紀　交翼並進完成先制目的</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　九州某基地部隊，攻擊敵機動部隊之戰記如下：接得敵機動部隊由東南方海洋迫近本土之情報後，基地之滅敵氣燄立呈緊張。敵擁有以補給艦船三隊編成之有力部隊，呼號進攻日本土，敵軍已暴露其爪牙，繼菲律賓登陸而有硫黃島凄烈之攻防戰。久已切齒忍無可忍之日基地部隊，過去台灣海面曾獲得偉勳，有百折不撓鬥志之日海軍某航空部隊，今已沸騰熱血，怒塡胸中，根據不斷發來之情報，於徵暗之燈下，樹以簡密之作戰計劃，決計果敢先發制敵，少許指揮官，飛行長及參謀長等各幹部全體，均握其軍刀，決心一意，由月落星稀之飛行塲出發。由於各整備員奮力工作，已備有萬全出擊態勢，銀河，天山，慧星等各新銳機，齊一步伐，發動機的爆音，震動了每個武士的心弦。勇士等於指揮所前列隊，敬聆指揮官之訓示，各勇士對指揮官激勵之詞，非常感憤，其後復受隊長之最後指示，勇士頭上包紮着紅色的日章旗圍巾，鬥志品揚，勇氣百倍，態度沉着，坐上了自己的愛機，在微暗的最曦之下，伴着轟轟的機聲，向着黎明的東南方漸漸的消逝了。海軍機數十架任先頭，搜索敵機，與陸軍機交翼並列，堂堂前進，技術高超之各勇士們，他們有着充份的自信，而在指揮所中之指揮官等，皆在希冀陸海軍機們迅速挫折敵機動部隊。不久，接到在某時某分發現敵機動部隊之第）個報吿，繼接到攻擊開始的報吿，已達成所期待之先發制攻擊大戰果，亦將現諸自前。指揮所內喜氣洋溢，精神頓形鬆暢，是時東南若干海里之洋上激戰情影已湧上心頭，巧避敵艦防禦砲火之烟幕與敵艦載之火綱而奮戰之日機，無論任何人均在祈禱着他的成功。受我軍先發制之攻擊，使敵軍焦急萬分，於日高三丈陽光當空之正午，，吾方久已窺透敵人此種企圖，於是使第二次，第三次之海軍機編隊，接第一次攻擊隊之後，而再予以重創。同時，突入敵機動部隊之上方，雖在敵空襲之下，仍然强行出擊，如斯之鬥志，終非敵所能阻者。戰塲上火花如雨，此外，並接到數决肉搏攻擊之壯烈報吿，雖在怱忙之指揮所內，諸人心中，亦浮起了各鬥士之勇姿。</p>
<h3>敵機大編隊　襲吳港未逞　被擊落四十架</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　瀨戶內海沿岸海軍制空部隊基地二十一日電，十九日上午六時頃，敵艦載機戰鬥轟炸聯合大隊的百五十架，企圖侵入軍港吳市上空，日海軍航空部隊數十架勇躍出擊，在瀨戶內海西部上空展開激烈空戰，敵戰鬥機及轟炸機均成爲日機之攻擊目標，日軍猛擊，獲得擊洛敵機四十架之戰果，敵機卒不支飛遁，日機未歸還者僅有數架。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰時輕工業之出路</h3>
<p>過去我們會一再申論工業疏散的必要，今後工廠必須遷移到原料產地，遷移到銷售市塲。因爲運輸的困難，正在一天天加甚，不就地取材，便無以繼續生產，不就地銷售，資金週轉呆滯，也無法繼續生產。要維持生產，樹立今後發展的基礎，只有將集中上海的工廠，分向各小城市去尋出路。</p>
<p>戰時輕工業發展的趨向，與平時完全不同：</p>
<p>第一，平時生產有利於集中與大規模經營，諸凡分工的精細，原料的堂批收買，動力的供給，機件的修理與購入，資金的融通，出口的便利，勞工的雇用，都以集中於海港河道鐵路等交通便利的地點，大規模經營爲有利；戰時則交通阻滯，動力減少，原料取給困難，勞力的價格隨糧價增高，出口停頓，推銷目標不得不移向內地，在在以分散與小規模經營爲　有利。</p>
<p>第二，平時生產向高度工業化的路走去，戰時因爲重工業的轉向軍需工業，機械進口的停頓，燃料電力供給的困難，向着相反的方向走去，甚至退化爲手工業或半機器工業。</p>
<p>第三，平時生產的出品以品質優良與精巧爲改進的目標，戰時生產因爲購買力降低，原料缺乏，故須以生產成本的減低與尋覓原料的代用品爲改進的目標。</p>
<p>爲適應環境，配合當前的需要，輕工業向內地發展，是確切不移的原則，也是必然的趨勢，然而我們環顧當前滬地工業界，能適應環境需要配合時代趨勢而作遷移準備的，寥寥無幾，工業界未能注意到本身今後的危機，是不可諱言的事實。</p>
<p>如分析這現象，有兩個理由可說明：上海工業界缺乏組織，是第一個理由，在平時旣不能謀同業的福利，互相合作，在戰時則步武不齊，缺乏領導，互相觀望。第二，政府未曾作積極充分的獎助，也是重要的因素，淮海省與江蘇省雖有歡迎遷移的表示，實業部雖已在硏究對策，但獎助遷移的辦法尙未頒佈，而外間則有收買小型紗廠的謠傳。我們認爲要推動上海工業疏散一計劃，政府此時必須立即頒佈獎助條例，予首先遷移者以便利，以袪羣疑，使消極的觀望，變而爲　積極的行動。</p>
<p>目光遠大的工業家，必須起來領導道一運動，爲　國家爲　本身作久遠的打算，我們對此，寄以無窮的期望。</p>
<h3>硫黃島日最高指揮官　栗林中將以身報國　親在前綫率領全員作壯烈總攻撃</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日大本營二十一日正午發表：（一）硫黃島日軍部隊，自敵軍登陸以來，的歷一月，繼續勇戰，三月十三日以後，猶能堅守北部落及東山附近外廓陣地，繼續勇敢奮鬥，但戰局竟至最後闢頭，自該島來電謂，十七日夜半，最高指揮官親在前綫，率其全員祈念皇國之必勝與安泰，而敢行壯烈總攻擊，嗣後斷絕連絡。（二）自敵兵於該島登陸以來，至三月十六日爲　止，敵在陸上所受損害計約三萬三千名。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　硫黃島日最高指揮官栗林中將，於身先士卒之餘，向後方致最後電報，其電文如决：戰局已臨最後關頭，職站立前綫祈鵡皇國必勝及安泰，茲於十七日深夜斷然發動全員總攻擊。職等處於敵海陸空三軍猛擊之環境下，謹以盡忠報國之赤心，果敢殺敵，部下之奮戰精神，實令人感慨無量，然遭敵軍優勢之攻擊，吾軍相繼陣亡，不得已喪失扼守之陣地，誠屬恐懼不堪，尙乞海諒。本島若陷於敵手，則皇土不克安定，故翹待皇軍捲土重來，收復失地，然目下彈盡兵寡，決作孤注一擲，粉身碎骨，以報皇恩，謹率領士卒高呼聖壽萬歲，藉此永別。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　敵軍於硫黃島登陸之兵力，計海軍陸戰隊第三·第四·第五三師團，的四萬五千名，其損失則佔總數之七成三分强。目前日本本土南部重地委諸敵手，實出於不得已者，然在海洋孤島中克復各種困難，苦戰一月，使敵軍遲延時日，損害慘重，而發揮日軍之真髓，其不朽戰功，常爲後世永久不忘也。</p>
<h3>菲律濱日軍　繼續奮戰中</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫二十一日中央社電　菲律賓之敵軍，十八日以來逐漸向日軍馬尼刺東方中央陣地正面增派兵力，刻正於聖馬迭歐東方高地及其南方巴央巴亞東南附近，展開激烈戰鬥。此次戰鬥極爲苛烈，日美兩軍均傾全力，此實可謂陣地攻守戰之典型戰鬥，然戰況益趨嚴重，推移益趨衙大。日軍爲適應戰鬥，由右翼方面逐漸躍出陣地，採取攻勢，同時到處實行肉搏攻擊，使敵陷於混亂狀態。孟達爾邦附近十五處發和大火爆炸，日軍獲得甚大戰果。一方美軍在左翼安得保魯方面，對日軍第二綫陣地加以攻撃，然第一綫陣地之日軍，依然在美軍之重圍下奮戰到底，固守要地，繼續血戰，予敵重創隊，數日來縮小一部戰綫，整理陣地，十六日以來開始反攻，幷實行肉搏攻巡洋艦一艘·驅逐艦十五艘·運輸船四十艘·病院船一艘，靠岸美軍刻正實行掃海工作，并在修理馬</p>
<h3>最近國際情勢展望　——松平部長廣播演說詞——</h3>
<p>日大使館上海事務所松平報道部長，於昨（二十一）日下午七時二十分假上海廣播電台，以「最近國際情勢之展望」爲題，發表廣播演詞，曆時約二十分鐘，茲錄原詞如左：</p>
<p>（一）概況</p>
<p>最近的世界情勢，隨着大東要及歐洲兩戰塲的反軸心國反攻作戰，政治上發生種種變化。大東亞地域的關係，雖然作戰日熾，但以關係國少，所以玫治比較爲單純；在歐洲方面，敵人挑起最後的決戰，且各國利害關係，錯綜複雜，所以呈現極微妙的國際情勢。現在分別加以解釋。</p>
<p>（二）美國的東亞政策</p>
<p>大東亞戰域日本的敵人，是英美渝。而日本的盟國，是除了重慶以外的大東亞各地域新興國家與民族，但武力上幾完全畀諸日本之雙肩。在敵方陣營中。美國亦有漸次支配英國及重慶作戰之趨勢。</p>
<p>美國今日的目標在欲撃滅日本的戰力，另一個大目標，是企圖將連中國一起列入的大東亞之一部份置於自已勢力下，此實爲　羅斯福內心的最後目標。爲什麽呢？在此次戰爭中，美國動員龐大資源，以軍火借貸與英國蘇聯重慶，至其代價，向英國獲得太平洋上若干島嶼的利權，從蘇聯一無所獲。美國派遣軍隊赴歐洲，死傷已達四十萬以上，惟在歐洲不論領土或資源一無所得，僅不過將勢力擴張至伊朗，伊拉克與北非而已。</p>
<p>美國人把他的勢力擴張到世界其他地域，這是美國人的蓄意。美國的實業家與代議士等，對此日漸顯露其野心。我們先看重慶，美國表面上說帮助重慶開發戰事生產，暗地裏却在伸張其勢力，根據納爾遜到重慶後所訂定的計劃，美國戰時生產局發表稱：要實觀基礎工業，如開發戰山，擴張水力發電，製鐵，交通，增產農業等，需時五年至七年，其所需資材與人力亦正逐批派往重慶，但是美國希望着早日結束戰爭，正不惜一切犧牲猛進。他爲　什麽必須五年至七年方始可以成功的重要工業，拚命促其實現呢？那是不言可喻，就是美國企圖將來操縱全部的中國基礎工業，亦即他的眞正的東亞政策。</p>
<p>（三）美渝關係</p>
<p>美國目前想儘量利用中國的人力與物力，以抗日本，所以竭力使渝共妥協，使中國人灌注美國思想，並吸引大批軍人，給與美式軍火，授以美國式的訓練，他最後目標，還想永遠支配中國，所以對於基礎工業，無論大小工廠，全部由美國人執其牛耳，雖然是蔣介石亦不容有置啄餘地。飛機亦全部屬於美空軍，重慶的航空隊幾乎全是地上整備員及苦力，沒有踏上飛機的資格。據駐渝美籍新聞記者發出電報稱，韋特曼司令部向渝方提出要求供給年靑女子八百人，以充任通譯及打字員，使重慶極難應付。今日的重慶，已變成美國的屬國。然而重慶地區的有識者，他們的精神尙未泯滅，靑年階層孕育着獨立目由精神，國粹主義似乎已漸見普遍化，記得去秋，四川省民衆代表集會時，推出張瀾爲代表，發出勸吿蔣介石文，其中有言稱；「蔣先生，請不要做美國的走狗，尊重中國的自主獨立，減輕民衆的痛苦。」揣測其幕後人物，大的是白崇禧與孫科等，美國用剛柔並施的手段，拉攏重慶親美派，但越是想拉攏，起而反抗的愛國憂國之士更多，結果重慶有識人士與美國間，難免發生思想上的對立。蔣介石著名「中國之命運」一書，結論亦以中國獨立目主爲　趨，所以英美視爲具有一排外性的」而要求删改，由此可以證明英美與重慶間思想上有着闊的鴻溝。（未完待續）</p>
<h3>日閣議通過　追加預算案　並實施決勝勤勞動員</h3>
<p>東京廿一日中央社電　日政府二十一日芷午於院內開臨時閣議，小磯首相以决全體閣僚出席，首由津島藏相說明昭和十九年度及二十年度之追加預算案，全體決議通過。繼由相川厚生相說明關於實施決勝勤勞動員事項，全體議決通過，至下午一時十五分散會。</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日衆院二十一日下于一時四十二分舉行選舉法委員會，當即開始討論，多田滿長氏代表震政會作贊成演說，結果通過政府提出之衆院議員選舉法改正法律案之原案。</p>
<p>日合法推進國民總武裝</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　大達內相於二十日衆議院選舉法改正委員會席上，對木村議員所質問之國民德武裝事項，曾答稱：爲應付本土邀擊之緊急事態，政府以立法之手段，實行推進，同時對於一般之措置，刻正與各關係方面協議中，氏之說明大略如次：爲於本土邀擊敵軍，而將之擊滅，必須一億全體奮然蹶起參戰，此種預想之情勢，日趨緊迫。關於此事，軍部防衛國土及作戰之方略，而使全國國民爲保衛國土而奮起，政府爲採取迅速澈底之施策，刻正計劃以立法手段推進該案。此外，更與實際各關係方面協議中，他如各地現正築造城池及各種軍事設施，地方官民亦在一體全力協助中。</p>
<h3>中央黨部紀念曾先烈逝世</h3>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電　廿一日爲先烈曾仲鳴先生殉國六週年紀念，中央黨部特於上午九時在該部大禮堂舉行紀念儀式，到會執監委各部長褚民誼·鮑文樾·陳君慧·傳式說·蕭叔宜·何炳賢·巫蘭溪·陸潤之·方君壁遺族等百餘人，秘書長兼宣傳長褚民誼主席，領導全體參與人員行禮如儀後，報吿曾先烈爲和運努力經過及生前行狀，並言今後我們應步其後塵，担負今日更艱難之責任，完成先烈未竟之使命云云。</p>

<p>敵方企圖悉告失敗　（一）觀乎日本本土南方海面敵機動部隊之行動經過，即可明瞭敵欲偵察日海上及航空兵力之威力，企圖避免損失，但此項企圖悉吿失敗，而日方非特艦船無何損害，即地上損害亦極輕微。反之，敵方則遭遇重大損害，計擊沉航空母艦爲主者八艘，撃毀航母二艘，撃落飛機百八十三架，然敵因有相當之殘存兵力，仍不免有所蠢動。回憶去年菲島作戰之情景，更可明證，此次之行動，或與他方面行動中之敵輸送船團亦有關聯。又駐渝美空軍策憑敵機動部隊，實行蠢動，故亦須加以警戒，日軍更加嚴密防備。</p>
<p>攻硫黃島傷亡衆多　（二）硫黃島日軍，三月中七日以全軍決死精神突入敵陣，此對於過去一個月來勇猛殺敵之將兵，誠堪痛惜。然敵美因進攻面積狹小之硫黃島，竟動員太平洋艦隊全部兵力，海兵隊達三師團以上，而陸上戰鬥，敵方已自認爲創設海兵隊以來未有之苦戰，爲時不滿一個月，傷亡達三萬三千名，平均每日傷亡二百放十餘人，每小時五十餘人。又據敵方之空輸部隊發表：每日平均以飛機輸送重傷兵員至後方者達三百人之多，由此可知其損害之重大爲何如。再敵陸軍長官史基摩遜，太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米資，海兵隊司令官史密斯等亦謂，美軍越接近日本本土，則日軍抵抗越爲强大，即美軍犧牲亦愈爲重大。並暗示硫黃島日軍將兵之勇猛程度。總之，硫黃島爲一小島耳，敵以物量戰法關係，一時雖可獲勝，但今後易地決戰，敵之犧牲愈益重大，勢所必然也。</p>
<h3>萊因沿岸美軍採鉗形行動</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　海通社訊：那希·薩爾·與萊因河間之局勢仍不穩定，數量佔優勢之美軍繼續進攻，其目標有二：（二）大規模鉗形行動之目標在切斷薩爾·巴拉丁納特之德軍突出點，此項計劃尙未達目的，（二）企岡向西包圍，獲得局部成功，即分散德軍之防綫，最近數日來之戰事使德軍不得不作相當撤退。</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電海通社訊：艾森霍華方致力於脅迫萊因河中段，科不林士與萍根之間，美軍已獲前進。其南美第三軍已越恒斯魯克山系，那希特及奧爾姆方面美軍，進抵梅恩茲通達烏爾斯達特之道路。由萊瑪根橋頭堡向東北進迫之美軍壓力甚强，萊因河右岸之美軍，突入彼恩之西南。美軍由克魯資那許區而越恒斯魯克，向東南及西南推進，但被德軍反攻所阻。此區戰事之重心移至梅森希姆區及普　達爾路，美軍企圖包圍此區內之德軍未逞，薩爾勃魯根方面美軍被阻。</p>
<h3>蘇南路軍廿師　發動新攻勢</h3>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫全局醞釀新攻勢，戰綫南端蘇軍以大軍向拉勃－普萊斯堡發動攻勢，過去兩日來蘇軍在普拉登湖與多瑙河間，以步兵與坦克車二十師之衆，進攻德軍防綫</p>
<p>哥蕯克兵助德作戰　柏林二十一日中央社電　「德人民觀察報」十八日載稱：住在蘇領之多數哥蕯克人，均與德軍協力，並組成第十五騎兵團，出動於洪牙利及克羅提亞戰綫。</p>

<h3>出淵部長揭發　敵美侵華陰謀　覬覦大陸蓄謀已久</h3>
<p>盟邦日本陸軍報道部於昨日下午一時在漢彌登大廈，循例舉行報道常會，由出淵報道部長及囑託江城阪義雄等出席，中國記者亦到會十餘人。由出淵部長報道敵美機動部隊，出現日本九州東南海面，被日本陸海軍航空部隊痛擊情形，及美國企圖使中國變成殖民地計劃。談話如次：</p>
<p>轟炸日本土戰略意義</p>
<p>芙海軍機動部隊，出現於日本九州東南海面，十八·十九兩日目九州南部直達四國及近　方面，用艦載機進攻。日本陸海軍航空部隊，對此項敵美機動部隊，予以非常猛烈之攻攣，而獲得最近少有之大戰果。此次敵美航空部隊到日本本土攻擊，吾人預料方美國開始新作戰之第一步，與向米對於硫黃　因緩和作戰而出動之意義不同，極　注意。敵美行動，顯然爲對日本本土航空基　目標的攻擊。日本本土防衛設施之如何堅固，美軍基於過去一個月間在硫黃島作戰之經騐，已充分了解，而且對於特攻隊之犧牲戰法，非常感到危險與恐怖，故敵美企圖採用首先削弱日本戰力的方法。但敵美此次來襲，如當作在日本本土登陸作戰之先聲，未免過早，如當作擬從中國大陸作戰，改變直接在日本本土登陸之联兆，亦同樣失之過早。總之，敵美對日本本土之攻擊。殆將依然猛烈的繼續下去，同時對大陸之登陸作戰，敵美亦不能忘記。</p>
<p>陰謀使中國殖民地化</p>
<p>據敵太平洋艦隊司令官尼米資稱，關於攻擊日本本土需要佔領在日本周圍許多可能設立飛行基地的島嶼，大陸亦爲設立基地之後補點。以吾人常識觀察，大陸登陸作戰，將來必然實現，然此種企圖，並非基於戰略之需要，實以擴大　　中國之政治與財政爲目的。美軍進一步在華登陸，而使中國變成殖民地計劃，早經確定。關於此事之檢討，觀於向來美國與重慶之政治上及財政上之關係，以及武器援助之內容，即可明瞭，例如（一）美貸渝五萬萬美金，目的即在財政上束縛渝政權；（二）使中國戰區美軍司令官威特麥亞，擔任重慶軍參謀長，目的在干涉統帥權；（三）掌握戰時生產局及戰時運輸局，以管理經濟之動脈；（四）使哈萊大使居中調停國共糾紛，干涉中國內政。</p>
<p>民衆應奮起保衛國土</p>
<p>觀於美國謀略行動，敵美爲使侵華有力化起見，定在大陸登陸，且圖永遠駐兵中國，此乃彼等早定之計劃。對於當然在大陸登陸之美軍，中國應如何應付，乃爲吾人應加檢討之問題。反觀美軍以前在北非洲·義大利·法闌西等處登陸後之狀况如何，即爲吾人唯一之答案。美軍佔領區內之民衆現狀，據耳目所及，則爲失業，饑餓，自由剝奪，風紀混亂，以及生靈塗炭之苦，此種前例，中國可引爲殷鑑。中國民衆亟應考慮此事，考慮結果，即應强化防衛之處置。中國民衆爲保鄕安民及維護本身之生命財產，首應負起防衛之責任。在中國本土有一百餘萬之日軍，對美軍登陸定予以猛烈之打擊，而中國民衆爲防衛本國，亦應剪敢作戰，此乃中國爭取獨立自主之唯一途徑。</p>
<h3>七寶一瞥</h3>
<p>— 劉豐</p>
<p>走過封鎖綫不遠，迎面看見「七寶鎭」三們大字的牌坊，轉了滬，便熱鬧起來。街上全都是飯館，肉店，百貨店，豆腐店，其規模和設備，比周家橋，虹橋那些地方要高出幾倍。</p>
<p>我們首先訪問了松江縣境的三善中小學，這個學校的學費和薪金都是用米計算的，學費低級繳五升學米，高級繳六升，敎職員除供膳宿外，每月還有二斗左右米可拿。</p>
<p>過了橋就是靑浦縣境。接着又訪問了七寶鎭公所，知道了下面幾點：</p>
<p>（一）人口—靑浦縣屬下的七寶，計一萬八千人左右；</p>
<p>（二）出產—以棉花·黃豆雜糧蔬菜爲大宗；</p>
<p>（三）田賦—每畝收榖二十二市斤，因本地不產米，所以折價徵收；</p>
<p>（四）治安—維持治安者有靑浦縣第五區警察署，和省會保安隊第一大隊。</p>
<p>我們順便向店舖　問了一些物價，發現也並不怎麼便宜：肉每斤一千二百，切麵八百，連菠菜也要三百。比較便宜的是米，只有八萬餘一石，街頭巷尾擁擠着來自不同路綫的負米人。他們成羣地聚結着談價錢，手裏　着空口袋，火概米船還沒到。</p>
<p>七寶的米從泗涇，鳳凰山，天馬山那一路來的。泗涇的米是六萬，而靑浦縣城裏則只要五萬。</p>
<p>總之，越是西去，米價越便宜，越靠近市區，價錢越貴，從七寶往東到虹橋，到北新涇，到周家橋，以至市區，這一路上，距離不過一二十里路，然而每一里的米價不同。</p>
<p>米販子運米，大都從七寶運到虹橋或北新涇，到北新涇再轉售給從周家橋去的一批人，到周家橋，再轉售給市區的販十，這樣一段一段路的運，好像接力賽跑一樣。他們的利息很薄，一斗米最多賺一二千元，每越來往至多也不禍運一斗多米，不像市區上的米販子可以一抓就是兩三斗。他們辛動地奔走着，而上海就是靠了這點米，支持了市區內兩三百萬人的糧食供給。</p>
<p>這羣負米人一路上冒盡了危險，爲了捨不得化「卡子」上的開銷，也有讚封鎖綫，爬竹籬笆的，但也常有因此送命的，——至於挨打，把米充公還是幸運的呢！</p>
<h3>警局拘捕游民送勞動營習藝</h3>
<p>本市警察局第三處防犯科，奉令拘捕游民送游民勞働營習藝，以期澈底肅淸社會不良份子，而維治安。當由該科會同黃浦·虹口·長寗路·上海路·老閘等分局第三股司法員警至輪船碼頭火車站各處，拘捕黃牛黨及各該管區內之無業游民，第一批六十餘名，於昨日由該科防犯股主任周之輝探長臧孝梅分別審訊一過，確係無業游民，押送南市蓬萊路游民勞動營習藝，一方面仍繼續拘捕。</p>
<p>防犯研究會日內將成立</p>
<p>本市警察局第三處，於日前召集司法聯務會議，經義決組織上海特別市防犯研究委員會，聘請滬各級法院推事各級檢察署檢察官及典獄長司法警察官爲委員，研究防犯工作，　揚防犯意義，不日宣告成立。</p>
<h3>財政局將派員調查營業稅</h3>
<p>市財政局實施開征舊一八兩區本年度春季營業稅，通飭各業商號限期申報營業額及資本額，照章繳納稅款，業於本月二十日截止，尙有未及申報者，該局復嚴飭各業商陳述理由即日申報，否則即當依法處罰。該局並將抽調稅務人員訓練班受訓人員一百二十五人，派赴各營業稅區稽征處充任調查工作。</p>
<h3>簡訊</h3>
<p>醫院聯合會定期開會　上海特別市醫院聯合會定於三月二十五日下午四時假長樂路五三六號復興醫院舉行會員大會，已通知各會員醫院屆時推派代表出席。</p>

<h3>The Japanese Air Force Continues to Pursue and Attack Everywhere: Enemy Mobile Forces Retreat, Aircraft Carriers and Ships Sunk or Destroyed Number Twelve</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 21st: The enemy mobile force has been retreating southward since the morning of the 20th. Japanese air units are urgently pursuing the enemy, and the battle results are expanding. Among the battle results obtained on the 20th, those that have been confirmed so far are as follows: one regular aircraft carrier sunk, and one regular aircraft carrier destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the morning of the 18th, Japanese air units have completely repelled the enemy mobile force that appeared in the sea east of Kyushu. Since the dawn of that day, they have launched a bold preemptive strike, sinking one enemy regular aircraft carrier and destroying eight aircraft carriers. After the Imperial Headquarters announced these battle results, the attacks continued. From the 19th to the present, in addition to the battle results already announced, the air units have sunk one more regular aircraft carrier and one cruiser. On the afternoon of the 20th, special attack units were dispatched to launch attacks with guaranteed death and guaranteed hits, causing major fires on two large aircraft carriers, one of which has definitely sunk. Subsequently, Japanese air units continued to carry out night attacks. According to reconnaissance reports, the attacked sea surface was covered with oil and many other floating objects. In the continuous attacks since the 18th, there are still four unidentified ship types that have been destroyed. Therefore, the current overall battle results total at least twelve aircraft carriers and other ships sunk or destroyed. The Japanese Air Force launched continuous and fierce attacks on the enemy mobile force on the night of the 20th and throughout the 21st, and the battle results are highly anticipated.</p>
<h3>Attacking the Enemy Mobile Force: War Records of Japanese Army and Navy Aircraft - Advancing Side by Side to Achieve Preemptive Goals</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The war record of a base unit in Kyushu attacking the enemy mobile force is as follows: After receiving intelligence that the enemy mobile force was approaching the mainland from the southeastern ocean, the base's spirit to destroy the enemy became tense. The enemy had a powerful force composed of three supply ship units, clamoring to attack the Japanese mainland. The enemy had already revealed its claws, following the landing in the Philippines and the fierce defense of Iwo Jima. The Japanese base unit, which had long gritted its teeth in unbearable anger and had achieved great feats in the Taiwan Sea in the past, and a certain naval air unit with indomitable fighting spirit, now had boiling blood and filled chests with anger. Based on the constant stream of intelligence, a concise operational plan was drawn up under dim lights, and a bold decision was made to preemptively strike the enemy. A few commanders, flight leaders, chiefs of staff, and other key personnel all grasped their swords, determined to concentrate on one goal, and departed from the airfield under a waning moon and sparse stars. Thanks to the hard work of the maintenance personnel, they were fully prepared to launch an attack. New advanced aircraft such as the Galaxy, the Tenzan, and the Comet advanced in unison, and the roar of the engines stirred the heartstrings of every warrior. The brave soldiers lined up in front of the command post, respectfully listening to the commander's instructions. The brave soldiers were deeply moved by the commander's encouraging words, and then received the final instructions from the squadron leader. The brave soldiers, with red Hinomaru flag headbands wrapped around their heads, displayed high morale and a hundredfold of courage. They calmly boarded their beloved aircraft and, in the faint light of dawn, accompanied by the roaring engines, gradually disappeared towards the southeastern direction of dawn. Dozens of naval aircraft led the way, searching for enemy aircraft. Advancing side by side with army aircraft, the highly skilled brave soldiers had full confidence. The commanders and others in the command post were all hoping that the army and navy aircraft would quickly thwart the enemy mobile force. Soon, they received the first report of discovering the enemy mobile force at a certain time and minute, followed by the report of the start of the attack. The anticipated preemptive strike had achieved great results, which would soon be revealed. The command post was filled with joy, and spirits immediately relaxed. At that moment, the fierce battle scene on the ocean, dozens of nautical miles to the southeast, surged into their minds. The Japanese aircraft, skillfully avoiding the enemy's naval defensive barrage and the enemy's ship-borne fire nets, were fighting bravely, and everyone was praying for their success. Suffering from our army's preemptive strike, the enemy was extremely anxious. At noon, when the sun was high in the sky, we had long seen through the enemy's intentions. Therefore, we sent the second and third naval aircraft squadrons to follow the first attack squadron to inflict heavy damage again. At the same time, they broke into the airspace above the enemy mobile force. Even under enemy air raids, they still insisted on launching attacks. Such fighting spirit could not be stopped by the enemy. Sparks rained down on the battlefield. In addition, there were also reports of several desperate close-quarters combat encounters. Even in the busy command post, the brave figures of the fighters floated in everyone's minds.</p>
<h3>A Large Squadron of Enemy Aircraft Attacks Kure Port Unsuccessfully - Forty Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - A naval air force base on the coast of the Seto Inland Sea reported on the 21st that at approximately 6:00 AM on the 19th, a large formation of 150 enemy carrier-based fighter-bombers attempted to intrude into the airspace over the naval port of Kure. Dozens of Japanese naval air force aircraft bravely took off and engaged in fierce air combat over the western Seto Inland Sea. Enemy fighters and bombers became the targets of Japanese aircraft attacks. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack, achieving the result of shooting down 40 enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft were ultimately unable to withstand the attack and fled. Only a few Japanese aircraft failed to return.</p>
<h3>The Capital's Youth to Hold Regular Pre-Inspections</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The preparations for the Capital Youth Grand Review on the anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital have intensified since the convening of a preparatory meeting of representatives from various school corps. It is understood that the number of participants from each school has been decided by the schools themselves, and a pre-inspection is scheduled to be held on the 29th.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Way Out for Light Industry in Wartime</h3>
<p>In the past, we have repeatedly argued for the necessity of industrial dispersal. In the future, factories must move to the sources of raw materials and to the sales markets. Because transportation difficulties are increasing day by day, without sourcing materials locally, it will be impossible to continue production. Without selling locally, the stagnant turnover of funds will also make it impossible to continue production. To maintain production and establish a foundation for future development, the only way is to disperse the factories concentrated in Shanghai to small cities to find a way out.</p>
<p>The trend of light industry development in wartime is completely different from peacetime:</p>
<p>First, in peacetime, production is conducive to concentration and large-scale operations. Everything from the refinement of the division of labor, the wholesale purchase of raw materials, the supply of power, the repair and purchase of machinery parts, the financing of funds, the convenience of exports, and the employment of labor is advantageous when concentrated in locations with convenient transportation such as seaports, rivers, and railways, and with large-scale operations. In wartime, transportation is blocked, power is reduced, raw material procurement is difficult, labor prices increase with grain prices, and exports are suspended. The sales target has to shift to the interior, which is all advantageous to dispersal and small-scale operations.</p>
<p>Second, peacetime production moves towards high industrialization. In wartime, because heavy industry turns to military industry, the import of machinery stops, and the supply of fuel and electricity becomes difficult, it moves in the opposite direction, even degenerating into handicraft or semi-mechanized industry.</p>
<p>Third, in peacetime production, the goal of improvement is to produce products of excellent quality and sophistication. In wartime production, because purchasing power decreases and raw materials are scarce, the goal of improvement must be to reduce production costs and find substitutes for raw materials.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the environment and meet current needs, the development of light industry in the interior is a definite and unwavering principle, and it is also an inevitable trend. However, when we look around the industrial circles of Shanghai today, very few are able to adapt to environmental needs, meet the trends of the times, and prepare for relocation. It is an undeniable fact that the industrial circles have failed to pay attention to their future crisis.</p>
<p>Analyzing this phenomenon, there are two reasons that can explain it: The lack of organization in Shanghai's industrial circles is the first reason. In peacetime, they cannot seek the welfare of the industry or cooperate with each other. In wartime, they do not move in unison, lack leadership, and observe each other. Second, the government has not provided active and sufficient rewards and assistance, which is also an important factor. Although Huaihai Province and Jiangsu Province have expressed their welcome to relocation, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been studying countermeasures, the measures to reward and assist relocation have not yet been promulgated, and there are rumors of buying up small yarn factories. We believe that in order to promote the Shanghai industrial dispersal plan, the government must immediately promulgate reward and assistance regulations at this time, providing convenience to those who relocate first to dispel doubts and turn passive observation into active action.</p>
<p>Industrialists with long-term vision must rise up and lead this movement, making long-term plans for the country and for themselves. We place infinite expectations on this.</p>
<h3>Iwo Jima's Highest Japanese Commander, Lieutenant General Kuribayashi, Serves the Country with His Life - Personally Leads All Personnel in a Heroic Final Attack at the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at noon on the 21st: (1) The Japanese troops on Iwo Jima have continued to fight bravely for a month since the enemy's landing. After March 13th, they were still able to hold the outer defensive positions near the northern settlement and Mount Suribachi, continuing to fight bravely, but the battle situation eventually reached a final impasse. A telegram from the island stated that at midnight on the 17th, the highest commander personally led all his personnel at the front lines, praying for the victory and peace of the Empire, and daring to launch a heroic final attack. Contact has been lost since then. (2) From the enemy's landing on the island to March 16th, the enemy suffered approximately 33,000 casualties on land.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The highest Japanese commander on Iwo Jima, Lieutenant General Kuribayashi, after taking the lead, sent a final telegram to the rear, which read as follows: The battle situation has reached its final stage. I am standing on the front lines, praying for the victory and peace of the Empire. I have resolutely launched a final all-personnel attack on the night of the 17th. We are under the fierce attack of the enemy's sea, land, and air forces. We will bravely kill the enemy with our hearts of loyal service to the country. The fighting spirit of my subordinates is truly deeply moving. However, due to the enemy's superior attacks, our troops have died in succession, and we have been forced to lose our defensive positions. I am truly terrified and beg for forgiveness. If this island falls into enemy hands, the Empire's territory will not be secure. Therefore, we look forward to the Imperial Army's return to recapture the lost territory. However, at present, ammunition and soldiers are exhausted, and we have decided to make a desperate gamble, smashing our bodies to repay the Emperor's grace. I respectfully lead the soldiers in shouting "Long live the Emperor!" and bid farewell forever.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy forces that landed on Iwo Jima consisted of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Marine Divisions, totaling 45,000 men. Their losses accounted for a strong 73% of the total. The fact that important areas in southern Japan are now in enemy hands is truly unavoidable. However, overcoming various difficulties on an isolated island in the ocean, fighting fiercely for a month, causing the enemy to delay their advance and suffer heavy losses, and demonstrating the true essence of the Japanese army, their immortal military achievements will always be remembered by future generations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in the Philippines Continue to Fight Bravely</h3>
<p>Philippines Front, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the 18th, enemy troops in the Philippines have gradually increased their forces in front of the central defensive position east of Manila. Fierce battles are currently taking place on the high ground east of San Mateo and near the southeastern part of Bayangbayang. This battle is extremely fierce, with both the Japanese and American armies using all their strength. This can truly be called a typical battle of defense and attack, but the battle situation is becoming more serious and the trend is becoming greater. In order to adapt to the battle, the Japanese army gradually jumped out of the defensive positions on the right flank and adopted an offensive stance. At the same time, they carried out close-quarters combat attacks everywhere, throwing the enemy into a state of confusion. A large fire and explosion occurred at 15 locations near Mandaluyong, and the Japanese army achieved great battle results. On the other hand, the American army attacked the Japanese army's second line of defense in the Antipolo area on the left flank. However, the Japanese army on the first line of defense continued to fight to the end under the heavy encirclement of the American army, firmly guarding important positions, continuing bloody battles, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, shrinking part of the battle line in recent days, reorganizing the defensive positions, and starting a counterattack since the 16th, and carrying out close-quarters combat attacks. One cruiser, fifteen destroyers, forty transport ships, and one hospital ship. The American troops ashore are currently carrying out mine-sweeping operations and repairing Manila...</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Recent International Situation - Speech Broadcast by Minister Matsudaira -</h3>
<p>Matsudaira, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, delivered a radio speech yesterday (the 21st) at 7:20 PM from the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, entitled "Prospects for the Recent International Situation," lasting approximately 20 minutes. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Overview</p>
<p>The recent world situation, along with the anti-Axis counter-offensive operations in both the Greater East Asia and European battlefields, has brought about various political changes. In the Greater East Asia region, although the war is intensifying, the political situation is relatively simple because of the small number of countries involved. In Europe, the enemy is provoking the final decisive battle, and the interests of various countries are intricately intertwined, presenting an extremely subtle international situation. I will now explain each separately.</p>
<p>(2) American East Asia Policy</p>
<p>Japan's enemies in the Greater East Asia war zone are Britain, America, and Chongqing. Japan's allies are the emerging countries and ethnic groups in various regions of Greater East Asia other than Chongqing, but almost all military power rests on Japan's shoulders. Within the enemy camp, the United States is also showing a tendency to gradually dominate Britain and Chongqing's operations.</p>
<p>The United States' current goal is to destroy Japan's war capability. Another major goal is to attempt to place a part of Greater East Asia, including China, under its own influence. This is Roosevelt's ultimate goal in his heart. Why? In this war, the United States has mobilized huge resources to lend arms to Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. In return, it has obtained rights and interests to some islands in the Pacific from Britain, but has gained nothing from the Soviet Union. The United States has sent troops to Europe, and has suffered more than 400,000 casualties, but it has gained nothing in terms of territory or resources in Europe, only expanding its influence to Iran, Iraq, and North Africa.</p>
<p>Americans are expanding their influence to other regions of the world, and this is the Americans' deliberate intention. American industrialists and legislators are increasingly revealing their ambitions in this regard. Let us first look at Chongqing. On the surface, the United States says it is helping Chongqing to develop wartime production, but secretly it is extending its influence. According to the plan drawn up after Nelson's visit to Chongqing, the US War Production Board announced that it would take five to seven years to realize basic industries such as developing war materials, expanding hydropower generation, ironmaking, transportation, and increasing agricultural production. The necessary materials and manpower are also being sent to Chongqing in batches, but the United States hopes to end the war as soon as possible and is advancing aggressively at all costs. Why is it desperately promoting the realization of important industries that will take five to seven years to succeed? It goes without saying that the United States intends to manipulate all of China's basic industries in the future, which is its true East Asia policy.</p>
<p>(3) US-Chongqing Relations</p>
<p>The United States currently wants to make as much use of China's manpower and material resources as possible to resist Japan, so it is doing its best to make Chongqing and the Communists compromise, instill American ideas in the Chinese people, and attract a large number of soldiers, give them American-style weapons, and provide them with American-style training. Its ultimate goal is to permanently dominate China, so for basic industries, whether large or small factories, all are controlled by Americans, and even Chiang Kai-shek is not allowed to interfere. All aircraft also belong to the US Air Force. Almost all of Chongqing's air force consists of ground maintenance personnel and laborers, and they are not qualified to board aircraft. According to a telegram sent by an American journalist stationed in Chongqing, the Wedemeyer Command has requested Chongqing to supply 800 young women to serve as translators and typists, making it extremely difficult for Chongqing to cope. Today's Chongqing has become a dependency of the United States. However, the people of insight in the Chongqing area have not lost their spirit. The younger generation is cultivating a spirit of independence and freedom, and national patriotism seems to be gradually becoming widespread. I remember that last autumn, when representatives of the Sichuan Province people gathered, they elected Zhang Lan as their representative and issued a letter of advice to Chiang Kai-shek, which stated, "Mr. Chiang, please do not be a running dog of the United States, respect China's autonomy and independence, and alleviate the suffering of the people." Speculating on the people behind the scenes, the main ones are Bai Chongxi and Sun Ke. The United States is using both hard and soft tactics to win over pro-American factions in Chongqing, but the more it wants to win them over, the more patriotic and concerned people rise up in resistance. As a result, ideological conflicts are bound to occur between Chongqing's people of insight and the United States. Chiang Kai-shek's famous book "China's Destiny" also concludes that China's independence and autonomy are the trend, so Britain and the United States regard it as having an "anti-foreign" nature and demand deletions. This proves that there is a wide gap between the ideas of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Closer the Enemy Gets to Japan, the Greater the Damage: Statement by Minister Matsushima Yesterday</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, the Press Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, issued a statement yesterday, asserting that the closer the enemy gets to Japan, the greater their damage will be. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Attempts to Fail Completely (1) Looking at the movements of the enemy's mobile units in the sea south of Japan, it is clear that the enemy wanted to scout the power of Japan's naval and air forces and avoid losses, but this attempt failed completely. Not only were Japanese ships undamaged, but the damage on the ground was also minimal. On the other hand, the enemy suffered heavy losses, including eight aircraft carriers sunk, two carriers damaged, and 183 aircraft shot down. However, because the enemy still has considerable remaining forces, they are bound to make some more moves. Recalling the situation in the Philippines last year, it is even clearer that this action may also be related to the enemy's transport convoys in other areas. In addition, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is relying on enemy mobile units to carry out its moves, so we must also be vigilant, and the Japanese army is taking more strict precautions.</p>
<p>Heavy Casualties in the Attack on Iwo Jima (2) The Japanese army on Iwo Jima, on March 7th, with the spirit of a whole army determined to die, broke into the enemy's lines, which is truly regrettable for the soldiers who have bravely killed the enemy for the past month. However, the American enemy, in order to attack the small area of Iwo Jima, mobilized the entire Pacific Fleet, with more than three marine divisions. In land combat, the enemy has admitted that it is the most difficult battle since the establishment of the Marine Corps. In less than a month, casualties have reached 33,000, an average of more than 200 people per day, and more than 50 people per hour. According to the enemy's air transport unit, an average of 300 seriously wounded soldiers are transported to the rear by plane every day, which shows the extent of the damage. Furthermore, the enemy's army commander, General Smith, Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz, Marine Corps Commander Smith, etc., also said that the closer the American army gets to Japan, the stronger the Japanese army's resistance will be, and the greater the American army's sacrifices will be. They also hinted at the bravery of the Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima. In short, Iwo Jima is only a small island, and the enemy may win temporarily due to their war of attrition, but in future decisive battles, the enemy's sacrifices will inevitably be even greater.</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops on the Rhine Adopt Pincer Movement</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Haltung Telegraph Agency reports: The situation between the Naji Saar and the Rhine River remains unstable. The numerically superior American troops continue to advance, with two objectives: (1) The goal of a large-scale pincer movement is to cut off the German salient in the Saar Palatinate. This plan has not yet been achieved. (2) An attempt to encircle from the west has achieved partial success, that is, dispersing the German defense line. The recent battles have forced the German army to make considerable withdrawals.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Haltung Telegraph Agency reports: Eisenhower's forces are working hard to threaten the middle reaches of the Rhine River, between Coblenz and Pingen. American troops have made progress. The U.S. Third Army in the south has crossed the Hengsruck Mountains. The U.S. troops in the directions of Nacht and Olmu have reached the road from Mainz to Ulstadt. The pressure from the American troops advancing northeast from the Remagen bridgehead is strong. The American troops on the right bank of the Rhine River have broken into the southwest of Bien. American troops advanced southeast and southwest from the Kreuznach area across the Hengsruck, but were blocked by German counterattacks. The focus of the battle in this area has shifted to the Meisenheim area and the Pudal Road. The American attempt to encircle the German troops in this area failed, and the American troops in Saarbrücken were blocked.</p>
<h3>Soviet Southern Route Army Launches New Offensive with 20 Divisions</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - Haltung Telegraph Agency reports: A new offensive is brewing on the entire Eastern Front. At the southern end of the front, the Soviet army launched an offensive towards La Rab-Pressburg with a large force. In the past two days, the Soviet army has attacked the German defense line between Lake Platten and the Danube River with 20 divisions of infantry and tanks.</p>
<p>Cossacks Help the Germans Fight Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) - The "German People's Observer" of the 18th reported that most of the Cossacks living in the Soviet territory are cooperating with the German army and have formed the 15th Cavalry Regiment, which is operating on the Hungarian and Croatian fronts.</p>

<h3>Municipal Economic Bureau Actively Reorganizing Public Associations; Some Associations Will Be Reorganized and Merged</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau believes that the public associations of various industries in the city are poorly organized, and their affairs are very disorganized. Moreover, there are many associations with the same nature and industry, which not only cannot maintain the honor and development of the industry, but even lead to disputes from time to time. In order to promote wartime economic policies, the Bureau has formulated a comprehensive plan to actively strengthen the organizational structure of public associations in various industries and has begun to take two steps: reorganization and management. Regarding the reorganization work, forms have been issued to conduct a comprehensive survey of the internal organizational system, the actual situation of association affairs, and the economic conditions of public associations in various industries. It is now learned that the associations of various industries have filled out and submitted the forms in accordance with the requirements. Some associations have not yet submitted the forms, and they are being urged to do so. At the same time, the competent department of the Bureau is supervising and reviewing whether the information filled in the survey forms submitted by the various associations is accurate, and listing the order of associations with the same industry with opinions, in order to study and determine the reorganization, merging, or restructuring. Associations that are not necessary to exist will be ordered to be abolished, so that the organizations of public associations in various industries of major commodities, secondary commodities, and ordinary commodities in the city will be more sound, and management will be facilitated, in order to conform to the wartime economic system. It is heard that the reorganization and merger of some associations will soon be implemented.</p>
<h3>Self-Installed Generators Must Be Registered and Only Allowed to Be Installed After Passing Inspection</h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau believes that after the reduction of current, factories and entertainment venues in the city have been installing generators on their own, but they do not comply with the regulations and endanger safety. Therefore, in order to unify management, it has specially formulated registration regulations. All factories and entertainment venues in the city that have self-installed such engines must apply for registration at the Second Section of the Bureau on Hankou Road in accordance with the regulations. Only after passing the inspection by the Bureau will they be allowed to install them, in order to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Since the Bureau launched the registration of advertisers in the city, there are still many who have not applied for registration. It is hereby ordered that all advertisers in the city must register with the Second Section of the Bureau before April 15, otherwise, all the advertisements they operate will be banned.</p>
<h3>The City Prepares to Celebrate the Return to the Capital Anniversary</h3>
<p>The 30th of this month is the 5th anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The Municipal Propaganda Department and the Municipal Party Department, in order to prepare for the celebration, have jointly convened relevant groups and organizations in the city to hold the first preparatory meeting at 2:30 pm today (the 22nd) in the conference hall of the Municipal Propaganda Department on Jiangxi Road to discuss the progress.</p>
<h3>Port Bureau Protects Unloading in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The Port Police Department under the Jianghai Customs Port Bureau believes that recently, major commercial firms have been unloading passengers and goods in the Huangpu River without reporting to the Department or requesting protection in advance, which inevitably leads to unexpected events. In order to protect the safety of passengers and goods, it is now ordered that major commercial firms, etc., must request the dispatch of police for protection in advance when unloading goods in the Huangpu River, in order to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Venues Operating Overtime Receive Warnings</h3>
<p>Entertainment venues in the western part of the city often operate overtime in violation of police regulations. Yao Benyuan, the head of the Changning Road Sub-bureau, has repeatedly received secret reports and personally investigated the venues. He found that several venues, including the Argentina Ballroom, the Country Restaurant, and the Yuyuan Cafe, were indeed operating overtime. He summoned the owners of the venues to the bureau to inform them and, with the approval of the General Bureau, gave them written warnings. If the above situation occurs again, they will be suspended from business.</p>
<h3>Municipal Propaganda Department Revises Drama Censorship Rules</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen drama censorship, the Municipal Propaganda Department has revised the previously promulgated Shanghai Special Municipal Drama Censorship Rules and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. Regarding future drama censorship work, all past practices will be abolished, and all matters will be handled in accordance with the revised rules. If there are any violations, they will be severely punished in accordance with the regulations, without any leniency. The Department plans to convene the persons in charge of various theaters, cinemas, and troupes in early next month to discuss the improvements in drama censorship.</p>
<h3>Cotton Control Commission Undertakes Organizational Adjustments</h3>
<p>The Cotton Control Commission has drafted a plan to strengthen the organization system of the Commission and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval, which is expected to be implemented in the shortest possible time. It is learned that the affiliated institutions under the Commission were previously the Cotton Purchase Industry Association and the Temporary Management Committee for Cotton Yarn and Cloth, but now it is planned to include the affairs and business of the two associations within the Committee. It is planned to set up two departments within the Cotton Control Commission: the General Affairs Department and the Management Department. The General Affairs Department specializes in administrative matters, and the Management Department specializes in business matters. It is also planned to set up five sections under each of the two departments. The original cotton organization and cotton yarn organization will be placed under the Management Department.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry to Raise Funds for Spring Cocoon Purchases; At Least 2.25 Billion Yuan Needed</h3>
<p>The Silk Industry Joint Association is actively promoting this year's spring cocoon purchase for silk weaving industries in three provinces and two cities, in accordance with the predetermined plan of selecting seeds, increasing production, and unified purchase. According to the Association's budget, at least about 20,000 dans of dried cocoons can be purchased according to the increased production quantity. In addition to the cocoons stored last year, at least 15,000 dans of dried cocoons can be purchased this year. If calculated at an estimated price of 150,000 yuan per dan, then at least 2.25 billion yuan needs to be borrowed for the purchase of spring cocoons to cover the expenses. The loan amount for China Silk Company's cocoon purchase this spring is not yet included. After the Joint Association convenes a meeting on the 29th of this month to discuss and decide, it will submit a written application to financial institutions and relevant authorities to proceed with the loan procedures.</p>
<h3>Minister Izubuchi Exposes Enemy's Conspiracy to Invade China; Has Long Coveted the Mainland</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Press Department of the Allied Nations held a routine press conference at the Hamilton Building at 1:00 PM yesterday. Minister Izubuchi and trustee Yoshio Egosaka attended. More than a dozen Chinese journalists also attended the meeting. Minister Izubuchi reported on the situation of the enemy's mobile units appearing in the southeastern sea off Kyushu, Japan, and being severely attacked by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Force, as well as the United States' plan to turn China into a colony. The talk is as follows:</p>
<p>Strategic Significance of Bombing Japan</p>
<p>The enemy's naval mobile units appeared in the southeastern sea off Kyushu, Japan. On the 18th and 19th, they attacked the southern part of Kyushu, Shikoku, and the Kinai area with carrier-based aircraft. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Force launched a very fierce attack on these enemy mobile units and achieved a major victory that has rarely been seen recently. We anticipate that this attack by the enemy air force is the first step in a new operation by the United States, and it is different from the significance of the Iwo Jima operation. We are paying close attention. The enemy's actions are clearly aimed at attacking Japanese air bases. Based on the experience of fighting on Iwo Jima in the past month, the U.S. military fully understands how solid Japan's mainland defense facilities are. Moreover, they feel very dangerous and terrified of the special attack forces' sacrificial tactics. Therefore, the enemy attempts to adopt a method of first weakening Japan's war power. However, it would be too early to consider this attack by the enemy as a prelude to a landing operation on the Japanese mainland. It would also be equally wrong to regard it as a sign of changing the direct landing on the Japanese mainland and instead operating from the Chinese mainland. In short, the enemy's attack on the Japanese mainland will continue fiercely, and at the same time, the enemy cannot forget the landing operation on the mainland.</p>
<p>Conspiracy to Colonize China</p>
<p>According to enemy Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz, in order to attack the Japanese mainland, it is necessary to occupy many islands around Japan that can be used as air bases, and the mainland is also a backup point for establishing bases. From our common sense, a landing operation on the mainland will inevitably be realized in the future. However, this attempt is not based on strategic needs, but to expand political and financial influence in China. The U.S. military's further landing in China and the plan to turn China into a colony has long been determined. Regarding the examination of this matter, it can be understood from the political and financial relationship between the United States and Chongqing, as well as the content of weapons assistance. For example: (1) The U.S. loan of 500 million US dollars to Chongqing is aimed at financially binding the Chongqing regime; (2) Making U.S. Military Commander of the China Theater, Wedemeyer, the Chief of Staff of the Chongqing military, is aimed at interfering in command authority; (3) Seizing control of the Wartime Production Bureau and the Wartime Transportation Bureau to manage the lifeline of the economy; (4) Making Ambassador Hurley mediate the KMT-CPC disputes to interfere in China's internal affairs.</p>
<p>The People Should Rise Up to Defend Their Homeland</p>
<p>Looking at the American strategy, the enemy is determined to land on the mainland in order to make the invasion of China more effective, and plans to permanently station troops in China. This is their long-established plan. How should China respond to the U.S. military, which will inevitably land on the mainland? This is the question that we should examine. Looking back at the situation after the U.S. military landed in North Africa, Italy, and France, it is the only answer for us. The current situation of the people in the areas occupied by the U.S. military, as far as we can see and hear, is unemployment, hunger, deprivation of freedom, moral chaos, and the suffering of innocent lives. China can use this precedent as a warning. The Chinese people should carefully consider this matter, and as a result of the consideration, they should strengthen defense measures. The Chinese people should first take responsibility for defense in order to protect their homeland and maintain their own lives and property. There are more than one million Japanese troops in China who will launch a fierce attack on the U.S. military landing. The Chinese people should also bravely fight to defend their country. This is the only way for China to strive for independence and autonomy.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Qibao</h3>
<p>— Liu Feng</p>
<p>Not far past the blockade line, I saw the archway with the three large characters "Qibao Town" facing me. Turning into Shanghai, it became lively. The streets were full of restaurants, butcher shops, department stores, and tofu shops, whose scale and equipment were several times higher than those in Zhoujiaqiao and Hongqiao.</p>
<p>We first visited the San Shan Primary and Secondary School in Songjiang County. The tuition and salaries of this school are calculated in rice. The tuition for the lower grades is five sheng of rice, and the tuition for the higher grades is six sheng. In addition to food and lodging, the teachers and staff can also get about two dou of rice per month.</p>
<p>After crossing the bridge, it is the territory of Qingpu County. Then we visited the Qibao Town Office and learned the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Population—Qibao, under the jurisdiction of Qingpu County, has about 18,000 people;</p>
<p>(2) Production—Cotton, soybeans, grains, and vegetables are the main products;</p>
<p>(3) Land tax—22 catties of grain per mu are collected. Because rice is not produced locally, it is collected at a discounted price;</p>
<p>(4) Public security—The 5th District Police Station of Qingpu County and the 1st Battalion of the Provincial Security Team maintain public security.</p>
<p>We casually asked some shopkeepers about prices and found that they were not very cheap: meat was 1,200 per catty, sliced noodles were 800, and even spinach was 300. The relatively cheaper commodity was rice, which was only over 80,000 per shi. The streets and alleys were crowded with rice carriers from different routes. They gathered in groups to discuss prices, holding empty pockets. It seemed that the rice boat had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>The rice in Qibao comes from the areas of Sijing, Fenghuangshan, and Tianmashan. The price of rice in Sijing is 60,000, while in Qingpu County it is only 50,000.</p>
<p>In short, the further west you go, the cheaper the rice price is, and the closer you are to the city, the more expensive the price is. From Qibao east to Hongqiao, Beixinqiao, Zhoujiaqiao, and even the city, the distance is only ten or twenty li, but the price of rice per li is different.</p>
<p>Rice traders mostly transport rice from Qibao to Hongqiao or Beixinqiao, and then resell it to a group of people from Zhoujiaqiao. At Zhoujiaqiao, they resell it to vendors in the city. They transport it in sections, like a relay race. Their interest is very small, and they earn at most one or two thousand yuan per dou of rice. Each trip does not carry more than one dou of rice. They work hard and run around, and Shanghai relies on this little rice to support the food supply of two or three million people in the city.</p>
<p>This group of rice carriers risks danger all the way. In order to save money on expenses at the "checkpoint," some try to cross the blockade line and climb bamboo fences, but they often lose their lives as a result—as for being beaten and having the rice confiscated, they are still lucky!</p>
<h3>Police Station Detains Vagrants and Sends Them to Labor Camps for Vocational Training</h3>

<h3>Respectfully Requesting Local Schools in the City to Lend Vacant Classrooms During Free Time</h3>
<p>Regarding the free primary schools, we are actively preparing for them. Currently, the most fundamental and urgent tasks are four: (1) raising funds; (2) borrowing school buildings; (3) collecting textbooks; (4) selecting and hiring teachers. For the first task, since Mr. Xie Lilin initiated the "Free School Fund," we have received enthusiastic responses and donations from readers every day, which has increased our confidence and determination. The second task is to borrow from various primary schools. Yongguang Primary School on Carter Road has already sent a letter agreeing to lend two classrooms without charging rent, which is deeply appreciated. We plan to initially establish ten schools, distributed in various districts. If public and private schools in all districts of this city can utilize their free time (two hours designated from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM daily) and agree to lend two classrooms, please send a letter directly to the "Shen Bao Compulsory Education Committee," so that we can send personnel to negotiate promptly. We respectfully hope that the authorities of all schools will uphold the purpose of serving education and provide as much assistance as possible. The third and fourth tasks are also being planned and carried out. We are preparing to start school on April 1st, and the time is pressing. We hope that virtuous individuals from all walks of life will provide guidance and assistance at any time. We will sincerely accept all suggestions.</p>
<p>Enthusiastically Supporting the "Free School Fund"</p>
<p>(1) A group of elementary school students, Xu Dingwen, Jin Yuexian, Shi Renjun, Li Gen, Yuan Kekai, Mao Lunbao, Ying Hongye, Xiang Chun, Lin Yupei, and others, wrote a letter saying: "A few days ago, we saw that your newspaper wanted to help students who are out of school and planned to establish ten free primary schools. Later, we also saw that Mr. Xie Lilin initiated the establishment of the 'Free School Fund.' This matter is very meaningful because there are too many students who are out of school. We think that we are very fortunate to be able to continue our studies, but we should also think of those unfortunate students and do our best to help them. Now, we have accumulated our pocket money for these few days, totaling 5,000 yuan, and donated it to your newspaper as the Free School Fund. Although this amount is very small, we hope that all students in Shanghai can save their pocket money and help students who are out of school, then the amount will definitely be considerable, and more students will be helped."</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Zhang Yifan wrote a letter saying: "Regarding the lottery for souvenirs during a recent gathering of classmates, entrusted by Ms. Chen Yanhua's group, the prize won (valued at 5,000 yuan) is transferred to the 'Free School Fund.' Please disclose it in the social service column to clarify credibility."</p>
<h3>Basic Education Lecture - Fourth Lecture</h3>
<p>The fourth Basic Education Lecture, organized by this office, is scheduled to be held on the 25th of this month (Sunday) from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, still at Zhengxing Girls' High School on Luoyang Road. Education expert Mr. Yang Zhixian will be invited to speak on "Several Specific Issues in Common Sense Teaching." All primary school teachers in this city are welcome to attend the lecture, and principals of various primary schools are also welcome to participate, in order to jointly study and make effective improvements to education.</p>
<p>Musician Seeking Housing: Mr. Mei Baiqi, an Italian musician and former conductor of the Shanghai Municipal Council Symphony Orchestra, has been teaching piano in Shanghai in recent years, producing many talented students. Recently, he wants to move but cannot afford to find a house. If there are music lovers who have spare houses to sublet or can introduce two rooms, please contact Mr. Shen at 76245.</p>
<h3>Free School Fund Donation Report (3)</h3>
<p>Zhang Yifan 5,000 yuan, a group of elementary school students 5,000 yuan, Dong Zhiying 300 yuan, totaling 10,300 yuan, plus the previous balance of 1,047,300 yuan.</p>
