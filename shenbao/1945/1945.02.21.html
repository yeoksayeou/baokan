<h3 id="c1">硫磺島上密集戰　日守軍猛許砲擊　殺傷敵兵員達三千五百名 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　大本營二十日下午三時發表：敵軍十九日晨於硫磺島開始登陸，該島日軍守備部隊刻正在邀擊激戰中。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　硫磺島周邊之敵軍，十九日上午六時二十分，以大型運輸船五十餘艘接近該島南方海面，至六時五十分，復以登陸用舟艇約三百艘，於近海岸處海面完成登陸態勢。八時許將登陸用舟艇分作三梯團，開始於二根濱海岸强行登陸，日軍守備部隊常即加以猛攻，摺鉢山及南登陸地點之日軍重砲及重輕機關槍，亦對該登陸部隊自東西兩方猛施砲擊，予敵重創，然敵軍仍繼續强行登陸，至是日正午，已挾戰車百五十輛及的四千之兵力登陸，其先鋒一部業已到達千島飛機塲西南端。截止十九日正午，日軍戰果除擊毀焚燒其登陸用舟艇十艘，擱淺戰車三十餘輛外，並斃敵二千餘名，予敵軍第一棧陣地以重大損害，刻仍在激戰中。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　硫磺島之敵美登陸軍，至十九日下午，以携有戰車之有力一部隊，對該島西南端摺鉢山之日軍陣地加以攻擎，同時，以其主力對該島中央東南側面之小笠原方面，加以壓力，嗣後敵軍更於增派登陸戰車約百五十輛之外，努力增加兵力，至下行九時許，敵軍之橋頭堡，計自南碧頭北方直至飛機塲南部，其正面的三公里，縱深達三四百米突。此外，敵軍更於是日夜以一部兵力企圖在東南角之海岸及東側海岸登陸，日軍正對此加以猛攻中。</p>
<p>火山島上大戰較任何次激勵</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　於硫磺島登陸之敵美海軍兵團，曾令其主力向該島南岸西角之千島飛行塲正面前進，迄十九日下午八時，敵軍進攻此處，已使用兵員的一萬名及水陸兩用戰車等約二百輛，斯時，布陣於該島西端摺鉢山及南部登陸處所正面高地之日軍部隊，常即邀擎，至本日夕刻，已殺傷敵兵員三千五百名，其後仍在擴大戰果中。按硫被島乃典型之火山島，因該島沿岸皆爲愈縮愈高之梯形石崖，故敵登陸軍雖費十二小時，但其橋頭堡僅止於深達三百米至七百米之程度，在寬的三公里戰錢上之敵軍，爲深展其橋頭堡，現正集結大軍，惡戰苦鬥，然地狹兵多之密集作戰，惟有遭受損害而已。敵軍在登陸之前，曾速續轟炸的六十次，同時並以艦砲猛烈射擊，然日軍之陣地幾未遭害，敵軍登陸時，已發揮百分之百之力量，總之，敵軍此次作戰之流血實多，較旣往之任何一次作戰爲激烈。</p>
<p>敵艦船已退至四十公里</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　琉磺島之敵艦船團，內含多數空母戰艦，故於海上勢力規模頗大，此等艦船不僅終日於艦載機之掩護下從事登陸作戰，且其中一部於距海岸十公里之地點附近，終夜以艦砲射擊，其艦船則退至的四十公里以外地點，而不斷移動位置，以警戒日軍之奇襲。又敵偵察機與艦上或地上之連絡，數週以來完全使用明碼電報，由此亦可知因日軍之猛烈反擊，致使敵感覺緊迫之一般</p>

<p>緬甸前線二十日中央社電　蘭里島日軍，自一月二十一日敵軍在卡克林市街登陸以來，分別展開突擊戰，予敵損失至大。本月八日敵軍在戰車十輛之掩護下，以圖突破蘭里市外高地之日軍陸地，與日軍激戰，九日日軍發動反攻，殺傷敵軍四百餘名，戰果刻仍在擴大中。</p>
<p>緬甸十九日中央社電　日軍緬甸航空部隊戰鬥隊，十七日薄慕搜尋攻擊巴克庫附近之敵部隊，當有敵裝甲車四輛中彈起火，此外並擊毀其六十輛，同時更與邀擊而來之敵小型運輸機交戰，結果擊落擊毀其P38型各一架，更强襲敵方堡壘，將之擊毀，日機則全數歸還基地</p>

<p>東京二十日中央社電　日海軍省二月十九日發表：任命海軍中將後藤英次爲大湊警備府司令畏官。又前任長官海軍中將井上保雄，調任軍令部。</p>
<h3 id="c4">前日東京附近　有熾烈空戰　擊落B29型機廿一架 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日大本營二十日下午三時發表，關於十九日敵B29型機來襲東京附近時之邀擊戰果，嗣後經查明如次（包含已發表者）：擊落二十一架（內二架係拼撞而落），日方自炸及未歸還者計四架。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　敵B29型機約百架，十九日下午來襲東京附近時，經日機邀擊之戰果，至是日下午四時，已確認爲擊落十架，並已發表，唯其後經繼續調查結果，又確認追加十一架，共擊落敵機二十一架。此外，予以損害者，亦有若干架，嚴格計算之，兩者總計实达二十架以上，爲避免二重計算，故發表者常以其最少限度爲標準，即綜計擊落與擊毀者，实達來襲敵機之半數。是日之空戰異常熾烈，敵轟炸目標未克達到，僅對市街各地爲破壞交通路綫，但結果加以盲炸，即行邇走。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　敵機動部隊艦載機，十六·十七日兩日初次空襲關東，靜岡地區後，十九日下午二時半許，馬利亞納之B29型敵機，以百架左右之大編隊，自愛知，靜岡海岸方面侵入日本本土，其主力的九十架，分爲九個編隊，自是日二時五十分左右至三時四十一分之間，來襲東京及東京周圍地區，日軍制空部隊前已獲得邀擊敵艦載機之輝煌戰果，故士氣愈爲振奮，是時空陸一體，當即展開猛烈邀擊戰，至下午四時，查明收得擊落戰果巳逾十架，合計尙未接獲報吿者，實收得相當之戰果，因此，敵編隊未侵入束京地區時，即先自混亂，其投下炸彈，亦漫無準確目標，僅在東京內外對各處盲目投彈而已，故日方地上損失極微。又　機之一部曾企圖　　　　縣之鐵橋及橋樑，亦　　逞。</p>

<h3 id="c6">南滙縣之新塲鎭 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>一月念七日，記者由周浦搭汽船前往新塲攷察。船身甚小，祗可容客三四十人。乘客擁擠情形，不堪言狀。八時開行，兩小時許即抵新塲鎭。</p>
<p>人口農田　按新塲係南匯縣之第三大鎮，爲該縣第七行政區。全區行政上三鎭八鄕，總計有人口四五〇一九人。其各鎭鄉人口稠密程度如下：（一）新塲鎭八八三一人，（二）坦直鎭四六〇三人，（三）三灶鎭三八九四人，（四）張橋鄕五〇六九人，（五）永慶鄉四七四〇人，（六）中心鄉三九二五人，（七）聯三鄕三一九八人，（八）坦東鄕二六二人，人，（九）七灶鄉二七五四人，（十）新南鄕二九八四人，（十）（一）坦北鄕二四三六人。至人民職業之分類則爲：（）農民佔百分之三五·二，（二）商人佔百分之廿一·五，（三）公務員佔百分之一·四，（四）學界佔百分之三··二一，（五）醫學界百分之一。四，（六）工人佔百分之一八·一，（七）其他職業者佔百分之一九·二，</p>
<p>全區有農田計一二三五八八畝（最近調查，田賦實收畝額）。按本區屬於南匯縣之西鄉，故其田畝之制度爲圖份制，有異於東鄉之團份制。其業戶地主與佃農之關係，亦與東鄕不同。蓋東鄕多係「佃田」，佃戶事前須先交佃價後，始能耕種。而此問則爲「召租」辦法，乃租戶先種田後交租價，但向例有租戶須向業主交「頂手」（即押租費），每畝一萬元，此係早年舊規，照目下生活指數比例言，似早有增加之勢。奈以大地主泰半墊居於都市中，對鄕間田畝事，有鞭長莫及之苦，故年來地主能收到此數者，已屬萬幸，遑論增加「頂手」。目前此間之租戶，若係五口之家，照現實生活情况，最少須種田十畝，始足維持全家生活，否則三五畝者，其經濟情况，仍不免捉襟見肘，溫飽堪慮矣。故現今新塲區以有限之田畝，而租戶之生活需用，又逐年增高，故需要更多之租田，形成粥少僧多，田畝不敷分配之現象。至租價一層，亦因環境關係，田地所有權傾向租戶，大有暄賓奪主之勢，業主常不易變更之。現此間租價的分兩種，即坦直，坦東，坦北，三灶，聯三等鎭鄕，的每畝七八千元左右；而永慶中心，新南張，七灶，新塲等地，則爲每畝六千元左右。至農產物則以棉花爲大宗，的佔農產物總額百分之六十，米次之，約佔百分之三十，豆又次之，的佔百分之五。（按新塲出有黑色大豆一種。俗名牛踏扁豆。極富滋養。奈以產額過少。而鄕民又多留爲己用。故市上不易買到。）</p>
<p>市容交通　新塲市容，雖較周浦·大團似遜一籌，但較南匯縣城，則又熱鬧多多，且街道整潔亦不能相提比擬。新塲鎭之精華，集中於南大街，包家橋一帶，該處沿包家橋江之兩岸，花行糧店林立，爲本鎭大宗貿易花·米兩項之集散地。至茶肆酒樓，則多集於洪福橋一帶。</p>
<p>新塲交通，頗爲發達。除民船往來外，又有公路汽車與內河汽船，每日往返頻繁。其貿易交通網，東至大團，西達閘港，南通奉賢，北到周浦。以上四地與新塲之距離，皆爲廿四里，亦云巧合矣。</p>
<p>教育狀況　新塲敎育機關，泰半毀於事變。目前小學略具規模者，首推新城小學。計有學生七三七人，敎員十八人，有敎室十三問，設備頗簡，且有數室門窗地板皆殘缺不全。據校長嚴君稱，乃係戰後當地流氓，乘火打刦，目下雖陸續修葺，奈以經費有限，不得已求其次，即利用學生勞作時間，逐漸搬澠泥土，塡高敎室地面，再設法輾平，以資應用云云。</p>
<p>至中學則僅有樂育中學一所，按該校規模至小，使有學生七十八人，分三敎室上課，校長爲吳鹿苹。校址事變前本爲達明女學原址，事變後則一度改爲新塲小學。該校侷處新塲鎭之西南角，四周毘運農田，庭院頗爲寬敞，故以是曾一度被唯利是圖之商人所覬覦，擬斥資收買，改建小型紡織廠，後爲熱心敎育之紳士所反對，事始告寢。</p>
<h3 id="c7">日情報局部長　井口氏廣播 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日情報局第三部長井口氏，十九日下午三時二十分，以「關於侵略菲律賓之美國情勢」爲題，對各地廣播，以日方樹立國際正義，解放東亞之戰爭目的，與美國基於帝國主義，謀支配世界之野心相較，並指摘美國之戰力不可輕視，更列舉美國之脆弱點，（一）人的資源缺乏，不得不違反民情，提出徵用國民法案，（二）補給之日益困難，（三）國民生活困難，呼籲國民諸君，以知已知彼，鎮靜不亂之態勢，向最後勝利之途邁進。</p>
<h3 id="c8">渝區民衆　渴望和平 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>漢口二十日中央社電　重慶政權背叛東亞，甘爲敵人英美奴隸，近復加强與英美之合作，準備大陸總攻，然一般民衆均漸認識東亞之新事態，尤其最近英美壓迫變本加厲，因而對重慶之抗戰更表懷疑，靑年學生層，知識階級渴望和平之氣勢，極爲濃厚。頃據到達此間之去年十一月抗戰地區民衆動向調查，首先即爲訴苦，然困窮者佔全體半數以上，次爲渴望和平者占主張抗戰者之三分之二强。又對抗戰前途抱悲觀者與抱樂觀者，其數相等，再决，即爲望遷居和平各區者，其中渴望和平者，以職業分類第一爲學生，第工農民　第三軍人，士人，第四商人，第五公務人員及其他。其中學生似希望和平者占首位，乃事變以來初次之現象，事變勃發當初，立於民衆先頭，煽動抗戰之學生層，而有此種大轉換，頗堪注目。又蒙受戰禍洗禮之農民，渴望和平，以軍人士人列其决，可窺知彼等對戰爭已感疲勞。公務員，商人列於最後，眞乃貪官汚吏奸商跋扈之實狀，暴露無遺，重慶之敗類，可謂屬於此種官吏商人階級之間。綜上以觀，抗戰地區民衆渴望和平，實出人意料之外，尤其知識階級之學生層，和平機運之抬頭，有關抗戰地區今後之動向，極堪重視。</p>

<p>自上月十五日本市市政府改組以來，爲時僅匝月，而各種表面上之改革，已收顯著之功效。最近本報特　「上海市政」一欄，收集各界之言論綜合發表。第一期已於本月十日披露，並得羅秘書長撰「今後之上海市政」一文，其中詞句賅括而含意深長，後顧前瞻允中肯繁，文末復以「希望上海市民，不分國籍，不分階級，與市府當局開誠合作，以共謀上海市政之合理合法的改進與發展」作强調之結論，足徵新市政當局抱負之宏大，且不以零星的浮面的進步爲滿足，而求更進一步的有系統的徹底的改造，以「合理合法」爲終鵠，此與全市市民之期待，以及一般輿論之呼籲實相吻合（參閱本報上月三十一日社評）。固盼各方面盡量發抒所見，同時盼市政常局旁徵博采葑菲無遺，將片段之貢獻彙爲有條理之計劃，此外更盼市政當局注意促進事業成就之三大要素——人力，財力，時間－庶幾所有計劃不致止於紙上談兵，而改造上海之偉業得以早日完成，願就此三者申論之：</p>
<p>（一）人力財力時間之平行性，有法令而無人遵守，有工作而無無人推進。任何機關組織龐大，而任何機關效率幾微，不能表現其應有之成績，不能達到其應有之進度。種種現象皆足以證實有人而無力，人數多而能力薄弱，重量而不重質，乃人力方面對於事業上之最大缺陷。或房宇漱隘，或設備簡陋。任何機關開支浩繁，而任何機關依然因陋就簡，預算決算之制度每不健全，縱有雛型，亦不求信守。事業上技術上以及其他方面之經費，每不能按合理之支配。謹愿者知量入爲出而不知開源節流，不求有功但求無過，狂妄者公私不分任意揮霍，家僕奴婢盡列入機關之名册，薪炭茶水亦可列人公家之開支，甚或以公款營利以公幣置產，然後偽造帳册以圖搪塞。種種現象足以表現貧乏與窘迫，蓋經費旣寡又復用之不當，使所有之財不能發揮其應有之力，此財力方面對於事業上之缺陷。讀報品茶，談天說地，乃中下級人員之普遍習慣。辦稿簽押，開會酬酢，乃主管人員之日常工作。加以行文之遲緩手續之繁重，縱不擱置，已足以耗時費日。乃復好紙上談兵不務實際，於是年復一年而無足述者。再加以遷調頻繁全班更動，不遑席暖更何以言政績。此時間效用方面對於事業上之缺陷。</p>
<p>（二）人力財力時間之連鎖性　若人力優秀，則必生財有道涓滴滯公，緩急輕重，支配合理，而使財力發揮無遺。又必愛惜寸陰充分利用，精神振作工作緊張，而使時間效用發揮無遺。若財力充裕，則待遇優厚生活安定，責之以勤奮勉之以榮辱，而使人力發揮無遺。又必設備精良用具完備，人百日能成者我十日成之，人十日能成者我一日成之，而使時間效用發揮無遺。若時間能充分利用，則百人之事十人畢之，十人之事一人畢之，而使人力發揮無遺。百年能成之事十年畢之，十年能成之事一年畢之，此不獨能減少消極之開支，抑且增進積極之生產，流節源開而使財力發揮無遺。</p>
<p>發抒議論，貢獻意見，在市民應各盡其協助翼贊之力，而人力財力時間之如何運用如何經濟，以及如何使之單獨的交織的發生偉大之力量，以負起改造上海之使命，則責在市政當局。在市民與市政當局各就其本位努力而開誠合作，然後上海市政之合理合法的進展，指日可待！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Intense Battles on Iwo Jima: Japanese Garrison Inflicts Heavy Artillery Fire, Causing 3,500 Enemy Casualties <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 20th: Enemy forces began landing on Iwo Jima on the morning of the 19th. The Japanese garrison on the island is currently engaging in fierce counterattacks.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces around Iwo Jima, at 6:20 AM on the 19th, approached the southern waters of the island with over 50 large transport ships. By 6:50 AM, approximately 300 landing craft had formed a landing posture in the waters near the coast. Around 8:00 AM, the landing craft were divided into three waves, commencing a forceful landing on the beaches of Nigenhama. The Japanese garrison immediately launched a fierce attack. Heavy artillery and heavy and light machine guns from Mount Suribachi and the southern landing areas bombarded the landing forces from both east and west, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, the enemy forces continued their forceful landing, and by noon that day, they had landed with 150 tanks and 4,000 troops. A vanguard unit had already reached the southwestern end of Chidori Airfield. As of noon on the 19th, Japanese forces had destroyed or burned 10 enemy landing craft, stranded over 30 tanks, and killed over 2,000 enemy soldiers, inflicting significant damage on the enemy's first line of defense. Fierce fighting is ongoing.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – As of the afternoon of the 19th, the enemy American landing forces on Iwo Jima, with a powerful unit carrying tanks, launched an offensive against the Japanese positions on Mount Suribachi in the southwestern part of the island. Simultaneously, their main force applied pressure to the southeastern side of the central part of the island towards the Ogasawara area. Subsequently, the enemy further increased their forces, deploying approximately 150 additional landing tanks. By 9:00 PM, the enemy's bridgehead extended from north of Minamibitou to the southern part of the airfield, covering a frontage of three kilometers and a depth of 300-400 meters. Furthermore, the enemy attempted to land troops on the southeastern corner and eastern coast during the night, against which the Japanese forces are launching fierce counterattacks.</p>
<p>The Great Battle on the Volcanic Island is More Intense Than Any Previous Engagement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American naval task force landing on Iwo Jima ordered its main force to advance towards the front of Chidori Airfield on the western corner of the island's southern shore. By 8:00 PM on the 19th, the enemy had deployed 10,000 troops and approximately 200 amphibious tanks in their attack on this area. At that time, the Japanese units positioned on Mount Suribachi on the western end of the island and the high ground in front of the southern landing area immediately engaged the enemy. By this evening, they had inflicted 3,500 casualties on the enemy, and the expansion of their gains continues. Iwo Jima is a typical volcanic island. Because the island's coastline consists of increasingly steep terraced cliffs, the enemy landing forces, despite spending twelve hours, have only managed to establish a bridgehead 300 to 700 meters deep. The enemy forces, crowded into a three-kilometer front, are now concentrating a large force and engaging in fierce combat to expand their bridgehead. However, in such dense fighting with limited space and numerous troops, they can only suffer damage. Before the landing, the enemy conducted approximately sixty consecutive bombing runs, along with intense naval bombardment, but the Japanese positions suffered little damage. The enemy exerted one hundred percent of their strength during the landing. In conclusion, the enemy's bloodshed in this operation is extensive, making it more intense than any previous engagement.</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Retreat to Forty Kilometers</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The enemy fleet off Iwo Jima, which includes numerous aircraft carriers and battleships, possesses a considerable naval force. These ships not only conduct landing operations under the cover of carrier-based aircraft throughout the day, but some of them also bombard the coast from about ten kilometers away throughout the night. The warships retreat to a distance of forty kilometers and constantly change position to guard against Japanese surprise attacks. Furthermore, enemy reconnaissance planes have been using clear code for communication with ships or ground forces for several weeks, which indicates that the enemy feels a sense of urgency due to the fierce Japanese counterattacks.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Expanded Gains by Japanese Forces on Ramree Island <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Burma Front, 20th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy landed in Kyaukpyu on January 21st, Japanese forces on Ramree Island have launched separate surprise attacks, inflicting significant losses on the enemy. On the 8th of this month, under the cover of ten tanks, the enemy attempted to break through the Japanese land defenses on the high ground outside of Ramree city. They engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese forces. On the 9th, Japanese forces launched a counteroffensive, inflicting over 400 casualties on the enemy, and the gains are still expanding.</p>
<p>Burma, 19th (Central News Agency) – On the 17th, the Japanese air combat units in Burma searched for and attacked enemy units near Pakhoku. Four enemy armored vehicles were hit and caught fire. In addition, sixty vehicles were destroyed. They also engaged enemy light transport planes that attempted to intercept them, shooting down one P-38 each. They further attacked enemy fortresses and destroyed them. All Japanese aircraft returned to base.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Navy Ministry announced on February 19th: Rear Admiral Eiji Goto has been appointed as Commander of the Ominato Naval Base. The previous commander, Vice Admiral Yasuo Inoue, has been transferred to the Naval General Staff.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Fierce Air Battle Near Tokyo Yesterday: Twenty-One B-29s Shot Down <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 20th that the results of the counterattack against the enemy B-29 raid near Tokyo on the 19th have been confirmed as follows (including those already announced): Twenty-one aircraft shot down (including two that collided and crashed), four self-destructed or did not return.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the raid of approximately one hundred enemy B-29s near Tokyo on the afternoon of the 19th, the results of the Japanese aircraft's counterattack were confirmed as ten aircraft shot down as of 4:00 PM this afternoon. However, after further investigation, an additional eleven aircraft were confirmed, bringing the total to twenty-one enemy aircraft shot down. In addition, several were damaged. To avoid double counting, the announced figures are always based on the minimum. In summary, the number of aircraft shot down and destroyed amounts to half of the attacking enemy aircraft. The air battle that day was exceptionally fierce, and the enemy's bombing targets were not reached. They only damaged transportation routes in various parts of the city and engaged in indiscriminate bombing before fleeing.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy mobile force's carrier-based aircraft first attacked the Kanto and Shizuoka areas on the 16th and 17th, approximately one hundred B-29 enemy aircraft from the Mariana Islands invaded the Japanese mainland in large formations on the afternoon of the 19th. The main force of ninety aircraft, divided into nine formations, attacked Tokyo and the surrounding areas from around 2:50 PM to 3:41 PM. The Japanese air defense forces had already achieved brilliant results in intercepting the enemy carrier-based aircraft, so their morale was even higher. At that time, the air and ground forces united and launched a fierce counterattack. By 4:00 PM, the confirmed results of the shooting down had exceeded ten aircraft. Including the reports that have not yet been received, the actual results were considerable. Therefore, the enemy formations became disorganized before they even penetrated the Tokyo area. Their dropped bombs also lacked accurate targets and were dropped indiscriminately in various locations inside and outside Tokyo. Therefore, the Japanese ground losses were minimal. Also, a part of the enemy aircraft attempted to [unclear] the iron bridges and bridges of [unclear] Prefecture, but also [unclear] succeeded.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Statement by Southern Japanese Naval Authorities <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Makassar, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese naval authorities, which govern the regions of Celebes, South Borneo, and the Lesser Sunda Islands, are actively promoting the realization of the East Indies independence treaty. They have recently announced the revision of the Provisional State Assembly Ordinance, the Provisional City Assembly Ordinance, and the Provisional Special Employment Ordinance for Indigenous People, which will be implemented immediately. The local Japanese naval authorities also issued a statement as follows: The authorities have decided to expand the political participation of the nation's training policy, increasing the number of assembly members in substance, relaxing qualification restrictions, and employing indigenous personnel. In the past, those who had not obtained qualifications under the Provisional Employment Ordinance for Indigenous Personnel could now be specially employed.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Xinchang Town in Nanhui County <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>On January 27th, the reporter took a steamboat from Zhoupu to Xinchang for investigation. The boat was very small, accommodating only thirty or forty passengers. The crowded conditions were indescribable. It departed at 8:00 AM and arrived at Xinchang Town in about two hours.</p>
<p>Population and Farmland: Xinchang is the third largest town in Nanhui County, serving as the seventh administrative district. The entire district administratively comprises three towns and eight villages, with a total population of 45,019 people. The population density of each town and village is as follows: (1) Xinchang Town: 8,831 people; (2) Tanzhi Town: 4,603 people; (3) Sanzao Town: 3,894 people; (4) Zhangqiao Village: 5,069 people; (5) Yongqing Village: 4,740 people; (6) Zhongxin Village: 3,925 people; (7) Liansan Village: 3,198 people; (8) Tandong Village: 2,602 people; (9) Qizao Village: 2,754 people; (10) Xinnan Village: 2,984 people; (11) Tanbei Village: 2,436 people. The classification of people's occupations is as follows: (1) Farmers account for 35.2%; (2) Merchants account for 21.5%; (3) Civil servants account for 1.4%; (4) The academic community accounts for 3.21%; (5) The medical community accounts for 1.4%; (6) Workers account for 18.1%; (7) Other occupations account for 19.2%.</p>
<p>The entire district has 123,588 mu of farmland (according to a recent survey of actual land tax revenue). This area belongs to the western part of Nanhui County, so its farmland system is based on "tu fen" (map division), which differs from the "tuan fen" (group division) system of the eastern part of the county. The relationship between landowners and tenant farmers also differs from that in the eastern part. In the eastern part, most land is "tian tian" (rented land), and tenants must first pay a rental price before they can cultivate the land. However, here, the "zhao zu" (summon rent) method is used, where tenants cultivate the land first and then pay the rent. However, there is a traditional custom for tenants to pay a "ding shou" (top hand), or deposit rent, of 10,000 yuan per mu to the landowner. This is an old regulation from earlier years. Based on the current cost of living index, it seems likely that this has increased. However, since most large landowners reside in cities, they have difficulty managing their farmland in the countryside. Therefore, in recent years, landowners are fortunate to receive this amount, let alone increase the "top hand." Currently, a tenant family of five in this area needs to cultivate at least ten mu of land to maintain their livelihood. Otherwise, those with three to five mu will inevitably face economic difficulties and struggle to make ends meet. Therefore, in the Xinchang area, with limited farmland and the increasing living expenses of tenant farmers, there is a need for more rented land, resulting in a situation where there is not enough to go around, and the distribution of farmland is insufficient. As for the rent price, due to environmental factors, the ownership of farmland tends towards the tenants, with a tendency for the guest to usurp the host, and it is often not easy for landowners to change this situation. Currently, there are two types of rent prices in this area: in towns and villages such as Tanzhi, Tandong, Tanbei, Sanzao, and Liansan, it is around 7,000-8,000 yuan per mu; while in Yongqing Zhongxin, Xinnan Zhang, Qizao, and Xinchang, it is around 6,000 yuan per mu. The main agricultural product is cotton, accounting for 60% of the total agricultural output, followed by rice, accounting for about 30%, and then beans, accounting for 5%. (Note: Xinchang produces a type of black soybean, commonly known as "cow tread flat beans," which is very nutritious. However, the production is too small, and most villagers keep it for their own use, so it is not easy to buy in the market.)</p>
<p>City Appearance and Transportation: Although Xinchang's city appearance is slightly inferior to Zhoupu and Datuan, it is much more lively than the county seat of Nanhui, and the cleanliness of the streets is incomparable. The essence of Xinchang Town is concentrated in South Street and the Baogiao Bridge area, where flower shops and grain stores line both banks of the Baogiao River, serving as the distribution center for the town's major trade in flowers and rice. Tea houses and restaurants are mostly concentrated in the Hongfu Bridge area.</p>
<p>Transportation in Xinchang is quite developed. In addition to civilian ships, there are also highway buses and inland river steamboats, with frequent daily trips. Its trade and transportation network extends east to Datuan, west to Zhangang, south to Fengxian, and north to Zhoupu. The distance between these four places and Xinchang is all 24 li, which is also a coincidence.</p>
<p>Educational Situation: Most of Xinchang's educational institutions were destroyed in the incident. Currently, the Xincheng Elementary School is the most well-established primary school. It has 737 students, 18 teachers, and 13 classrooms. The facilities are quite simple, and the doors, windows, and floors of several rooms are incomplete. According to Principal Yan, this was due to local ruffians taking advantage of the fire to loot after the war. Although repairs are being made gradually, the limited funding has necessitated a secondary solution, which is to gradually move mud and soil to raise the ground of the classrooms and then try to flatten it for use during student work time.</p>
<p>There is only one middle school, Leyu Middle School. This school is very small, with only 78 students divided into three classrooms. The principal is Wu Luping. Before the incident, the school was originally the site of the Daming Girls' School, but after the incident, it was temporarily converted into the Xinchang Elementary School. The school is located in the southwest corner of Xinchang Town, surrounded by farmland, and the courtyard is quite spacious. Therefore, it was once coveted by profit-seeking merchants who planned to invest in purchasing it and converting it into a small textile factory. However, this was opposed by gentlemen with a passion for education, and the matter was dropped.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Broadcast by Mr. Iguchi, Chief of the Japanese Information Bureau <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Iguchi, the third chief of the Japanese Information Bureau, broadcasted a message to various regions on the afternoon of the 19th at 3:20 PM, titled "Regarding the American Situation in Invading the Philippines." Comparing Japan's war aims of establishing international justice and liberating East Asia with the United States' ambition of dominating the world based on imperialism, he pointed out that the United States' war power should not be underestimated. He then listed the United States' vulnerabilities: (1) lack of human resources, forcing them to violate public sentiment and propose a National Conscription Act; (2) increasing difficulty in supply; (3) difficult national life. He urged the people to approach the path to final victory with a calm and knowledgeable attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e8">People in the Chongqing Area Yearn for Peace <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Hankou, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing regime has betrayed East Asia and willingly become a slave of the enemy, Britain and the United States. Recently, they have strengthened cooperation with Britain and the United States and are preparing for a general offensive on the mainland. However, the general public is gradually recognizing the new situation in East Asia. Especially recently, with the increasing oppression from Britain and the United States, they are becoming more skeptical of Chongqing's resistance. Among young students and the intellectual class, the desire for peace is extremely strong. According to a survey of the sentiments of the people in the resistance areas in November of last year, the first thing they did was complain about their hardships. Those in poverty accounted for more than half of the total. The second most common sentiment was the yearning for peace, which was expressed by a strong two-thirds of those who advocated resistance. The number of those who were pessimistic about the future of the resistance was equal to the number of those who were optimistic. The most common desire was to relocate to peaceful areas. Among those who yearned for peace, the first occupational category was students, followed by workers and peasants, third was military personnel, scholars, fourth was merchants, and fifth was civil servants and others. The fact that students seem to be the most desirous of peace is a phenomenon that has occurred for the first time since the incident. The student class, which stood at the forefront of the people and incited resistance at the beginning of the incident, has undergone such a major transformation, which is quite noteworthy. Furthermore, the fact that peasants who have suffered the baptism of war desire peace and rank military personnel and scholars after them reveals their fatigue with the war. The fact that civil servants and merchants are ranked last reveals the true situation of corrupt officials and treacherous merchants. The scoundrels of Chongqing can be said to belong to this class of officials and merchants. In summary, the people in the resistance areas yearn for peace more than expected, especially the student class among the intellectual class. The rise of the peace movement is extremely important for the future trends in the resistance areas.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Manpower, Financial Resources, and Time <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of the Shanghai Municipal Government on the 15th of last month, only a month has passed, yet various superficial reforms have already yielded significant results. Recently, this newspaper has specially opened a "Shanghai Municipal Affairs" column, collecting and publishing opinions from all sectors of society in a comprehensive manner. The first issue was released on the 10th of this month and included an article by Secretary-General Luo titled "The Future of Shanghai Municipal Affairs," which contained comprehensive wording and profound meaning, looking both forward and backward in a truly pertinent manner. At the end of the article, there was a strong concluding emphasis on "hoping that the citizens of Shanghai, regardless of nationality or class, will cooperate sincerely with the Municipal Government authorities to jointly seek reasonable and legal improvement and development of Shanghai's municipal affairs." This demonstrates the grand ambitions of the new municipal authorities, who are not satisfied with piecemeal, superficial progress but seek further systematic and thorough transformation, with "reasonableness and legality" as the ultimate goal. This aligns with the expectations of all the city's citizens and the appeals of general public opinion (see this newspaper's editorial on the 31st of last month). It is sincerely hoped that all parties will express their views as much as possible, and at the same time, it is hoped that the Municipal Affairs Standing Committee will widely collect contributions, leaving no good ideas unconsidered, and compile fragmentary contributions into an organized plan. In addition, it is hoped that the municipal authorities will pay attention to the three major elements for promoting the success of undertakings - manpower, financial resources, and time - so that all plans will not remain mere empty talk on paper, and the great cause of transforming Shanghai can be completed as soon as possible. I would like to discuss these three points:</p>
<p>(1) The parallel nature of manpower, financial resources, and time: There are laws but no one to obey them, there is work but no one to promote it. Any organization, no matter how large, has very little efficiency in any of its departments. They cannot show their due achievements or reach their due progress. All kinds of phenomena are enough to prove that there are people but no power, many people but weak abilities, emphasizing quantity over quality, which is the biggest flaw in manpower in terms of undertaking. Either the houses are narrow and cramped, or the equipment is simple and crude. Any agency has huge expenses, but any agency still makes do with simplicity. The budget and final accounting system is often unsound, and even if there is a prototype, it is not strictly followed. Expenses for business, technology, and other aspects are often not allocated in a reasonable manner. Those who are cautious know how to measure income and expenditure but do not know how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and do not seek merit but only seek no mistakes. Those who are arrogant do not distinguish between public and private matters and squander at will. Household servants and maids are all listed in the organization's roster, and firewood, charcoal, and tea are also listed as public expenses, or even use public funds to make profits or use public funds to purchase property, and then forge accounts to cover up. All kinds of phenomena are enough to express poverty and embarrassment, because the funds are not only small but also used improperly, so that all the wealth cannot exert its due power, which is a defect in financial resources in terms of undertaking. Reading newspapers, drinking tea, and chatting are common habits of middle and lower-level personnel. Drafting documents, signing approvals, attending meetings, and socializing are the daily work of management personnel. Coupled with the slowness of official correspondence and the cumbersome procedures, even if it is not shelved, it is enough to waste time and energy. Furthermore, they like to talk about strategy on paper but do not focus on practice, so year after year there is nothing worth mentioning. In addition, frequent transfers and complete changes of personnel make it impossible to warm the seats, let alone talk about political achievements. This is a defect in the efficiency of time in terms of undertaking.</p>
<p>(2) The Chain-like Nature of Manpower, Financial Resources, and Time: If the manpower is excellent, then it will surely generate wealth, and every drop will be given to the public. The urgency and importance of expenditures will be rationally coordinated, so that financial resources can be fully utilized. It will also cherish every inch of time and make full use of it, with energetic spirit and intensive work, so that the efficiency of time can be fully utilized. If the financial resources are abundant, then the treatment will be generous, the life will be stable, and they will be urged to be diligent and encouraged by honor and disgrace, so that manpower can be fully utilized. It is also necessary to have sophisticated equipment and complete tools, so that what can be done by others in a hundred days, I can do in ten days, and what can be done by others in ten days, I can do in one day, so that the efficiency of time can be fully utilized. If time can be fully utilized, then the work of a hundred people can be done by ten people, and the work of ten people can be done by one person, so that manpower can be fully utilized. What can be done in a hundred years can be done in ten years, and what can be done in ten years can be done in one year. This can not only reduce passive expenses but also increase active production, reduce leaks and open up sources, so that financial resources can be fully utilized.</p>
<p>Expressing opinions and contributing ideas is the duty of every citizen to assist and support, while how to use manpower, financial resources, and time, how to economize, and how to make them generate great power independently or interdependently to shoulder the mission of transforming Shanghai is the responsibility of the municipal authorities.

<p>The city's Economic Bureau, due to the sudden and sharp rise in general commodity prices in the city, repeatedly requested instructions from the Central Government on emergency suppression measures.

<p>Special Thanks to All Sectors of Society for Their Enthusiastic Support</p>
<p>The "Special Fundraising Team" organized by this newspaper to raise funds for the 8th Readers' Scholarship Fund was announced to be concluded at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. In advance, we hoped that the donations would be particularly enthusiastic on this last day to show the meaning of "successful completion". Sure enough, as expected, the good news came that the receipts exceeded 5.6 million yuan, setting a new record never seen before, which made us feel exceptionally excited. On the one hand, we are grateful to the teachers and students of 35 universities and middle schools in Shanghai for their joint efforts to organize the charity bazaar jointly organized by Shenbao and Xinbao and the two male and female youth associations, and for their tireless efforts to solicit donations and sell consignment coupons, with extraordinary results. Although the accounts have not been settled, 5 million yuan has been allocated in advance for application. On the other hand, we are grateful to the Kugian Drama Troupe for the charity performance of "Begonia" for Shenbao and Xinbao. We often accept people from all walks of life to purchase honor seat coupons. After deducting expenses, each newspaper received more than 530,000 yuan, which is even more considerable when combined with the figures from other teams. Looking back on the "Special Fundraising" from beginning to end, which lasted for 80 days, the original target was 1,000 teams and 20 million yuan. Now the number of teams is only more than 500, but the donations have exceeded the budget, with more than 8 million yuan in additional receipts, which can be said to be a successful completion and a pleasant surprise. The colleagues of this newspaper, on behalf of 5,000 poor students, extend their heartfelt gratitude to all the enthusiastic gentlemen from all walks of life!</p>
<p>Congratulations on the New Year, Frugality and Scholarship Assistance. Mr. Hu Zuyin and Mao Xinyi wrote: "Dear Sir, I read in your newspaper that Mr. Ying Yongyu initiated the establishment of the "Congratulations on the New Year, Frugality and Scholarship Assistance Team", saving expenses, helping out-of-school children, and benefiting relatives and friends. The method is good and the intention is kind. Mr. Ying also donated first to promote it, which is admirable. In response, we specially send the New Year's funds to be included in the "Congratulations on the New Year, Frugality and Scholarship Assistance Team", and wish our relatives and friends a happy New Year. We hope that everyone will respond together and achieve the cause of righteousness."</p>
<p>Collecting One-Yuan Tickets Was a Pleasant Surprise. Colleagues from Dao Heng Fulong wrote: "Dear Sir, I previously read in your newspaper about the scholarship movement that there was a move to collect one-yuan tickets. Colleagues and others responded by setting up boxes according to the method to collect them. Unexpectedly, when the boxes were opened for inspection, the tickets that were thrown in were mostly not one-yuan tickets, and some assisted with thousands and hundreds of yuan. Now, the collected funds are put together to make 10,000 yuan and sent over. I hope you will check and accept it.

<p>Chengye Middle School Enthusiastically Solicits Donations Chengye Middle School wrote: "Dear Sir, The teachers and students of our school believe that the large number of out-of-school people in recent years is by no means the fortune of the country. In the first semester, we mobilized all the students in the school to form a savings scholarship team, encouraging students to cultivate the style of thrift and righteousness. After half a year of saving every penny, we have accumulated a total of 40,683.8 yuan. In addition to donating 30,000 yuan to Shenbao for the first time to form a team, the remaining 10,683.8 yuan was donated to Xinwenbao to form a team. Also, at the end of last year, we launched a special fundraising team. Through the efforts of all the teachers and students, we raised a total of 65,605 yuan. In addition to donating 5,605 yuan to the Jinshan Shanghai Fellow Association Scholarship Fund, the remaining 60,000 yuan was divided into 40,000 yuan for Shenbao to form a team, and 20,000 yuan for Xinwenbao to form a team. Although the two scholarship movements in our school in the first semester are only a small amount, they are used to promote the spirit of Shangyi. For the savings scholarship movement, we will continue to promote it this semester. Please publish it to commend it and promote it, and hope that each school will follow suit to cultivate students' virtues of thrift and righteousness."</p>

<h3 id="e21">Impersonating Military Police Secret Agents, Hoping Citizens Will Report Them, Japanese Military Police Authorities Issue Statement <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Military Police authorities issued the following statement yesterday regarding the investigation of impersonating secret agents:</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese cooperation is the fundamental policy of Japan towards China. The Japanese military police are afraid that they are not taking care of the Chinese people adequately. They sincerely protect the general good people. However, recently, there have been people who have no relationship with the military police, impersonating the name of the military police, coercing good people, or extorting money, causing the general people to misunderstand the military police. It is extremely regrettable. Previously, a Chinese man named Zhao colluded with several friends and falsely claimed to be a military police secret agent. He set up an office in a certain hotel and illegally imprisoned good people to extort money. Fortunately, there was a secret report and investigation revealed that those people had no relationship with the military police and were immediately severely punished. However, many people have been harmed by them. It has been published several times in the past that the military police will never send Chinese people to detain Chinese people, or take them to the military police for investigation. If necessary, when taking people to the team, the military police must go in person, and after showing their identification, they will deal with it. Therefore, in the future, if any suspicious people are found, it is hoped that citizens will immediately report them secretly. The names of the informants will be kept absolutely confidential. Even if there is any disadvantage to the informants in the future, the military police will protect them. In addition, in order to protect the law-abiding citizens, the military police will adopt a policy of severe punishment for such illegal acts, regardless of their nationality. It is hoped that the citizens will understand the true intentions of the military police and report as much as possible to eliminate such people who impersonate secret agents. It is also deeply related to the welfare of the citizens.</p>
