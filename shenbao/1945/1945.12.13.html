<p>華僑返緬正交涉中</p>
<p>外記者問，報載英方拒絕華僑重返緬甸原居留地，中英雙方現正交涉，未悉其眞像如何？劉次長答，滯留中國內地之緬甸華僑重返原居留地一事，中國政府數月以來即不斷向英方交涉，英方稱，緬甸交通情况及糧食供應尙未恢復原狀，故禁止一切外僑入境，並非對華僑獨有歧視。現緬甸歸僑滯留內地，生活極為　困，我政府正向英方交步允許彼等返緬，因華僑返緬對緬甸之經濟繁榮亦有所裨益也。</p>

<p>民意機關產生方法</p>
<p>外記者問，共產黨稱，在邊區人民可自由選舉，請問中央倡導設立之地方民意機關，其選舉情形及成立之數字可否見告？張參事答，政府在抗戰期間，爲集思廣益，促進地方自治起見，曾設省縣臨時參議會，其產生方法，約而言之，縣臨時參議會，係由縣政府徵求各法國及地方人士意見，開具名單，送省核定，省臨時參議會則由省府開單，送中央核定，現在政府已通令後方各省，一律限本年底成立正式縣參議會，每省之縣參議會成立過半數以上者，即成立省參議會</p>
<p>淪陷各省限期成立</p>
<p>以前淪陷各省，應於收復後一個月內成立縣臨時參議會，六個月後再成立正式參議會，有過半縣成立正式參議會時，即成立省參議會。目前四川已有一百四十縣有正式民選之參議會，雲南有五十五縣，陝西亦有四十三縣，各省其有正式參議會之縣，已超出三百，其餘可望趕速成立。至於正式縣參議員之產生，乃分別以百分之七十及百分之卅之比例，由鄉鎭民代表及職業團體自由選出。省參議員則由縣參議會選舉，每縣一人，不論黨派，正式成立省參議會之省，據報有四川·甘肅及貴州。</p>

<p>三强外長會議本月十五日即將召開於莫斯科，美國務卿貝爾納斯已偕隨員前往出席，英國代表團一行亦將赴蘇。國際視綫漸次自華盛頓移向東轉。自九月間倫敦五强外長會議舉行以來，國際局勢頗多暗礁，全球都注目這些暗礁，而如何渡過，似迄未能覓取適當妥善的途徑。所以三强外長會議的召開，或許可以打開一種僵局。</p>
<p>此次三强外長會議的召開，本身似已是一種先天不足的產物。倫敦五强外長會議，實際上既無多大成就，這次三强外長會議，上承倫敦會議的餘緒，再加上了先天的不足，彷彿未必即能寄予多大期望。其實，這也不足爲病。外長掌國家對外政策的行使，能够彼此多有晤面交換意見的機會，縱未必即有若何成果，但對於促進國際間的了解，一定有所帮助，這自然是可喜的。但同時也不能掩飾我們的遺憾。波茨坦會議。主要是結束一種戰時體系而另創一種新的體系，在對德作戰的努力上，蘇聯英美的確負荷了很大的重担，可是道並不是說三强將支配整個世界。戰後的世界需要協調，已不是作戰時的一個武力問題。所以在德國投降以後，就有波茨坦會議的召開。出席那次會議的國家固然有些新領袖，但彼此的國策並不因領袖的變更而有所變更。由波茨坦會議而產生倫敦的五强外長會議是自然的趨勢。五强外長會議理應有所成就，並且繼續不時召開，但五强外長會議竟演變而爲三强外長會議，這本身似乎是一種倒退的現象！我們不免感覺到遺憾的在此。</p>
<p>再就議程上來說：雖然莫斯科傳來的消息，未必作準，但這裏面關係複雜，可以斷言。三强外長會議裏能够討論得有些微的結論，已可開將來再事推進的道路。倘若議程中有關於歐洲及遠東問題的討論，中法兩國代表的缺席，無疑地，將影響於結論的獲取。在關於如何管制戰後日本的問題上，中國是最先起來抗拒日本侵略的國家，土壤相接，受害最深，知之較切，中國有權要求，中國的意見應該被尊重。但如今莫斯科的外長會議，竟不看見有我國的代表。因爲中法兩國代表的缺席，莫斯科三强外長會議所可能討論到的議程，無疑地將受到某些限制。</p>
<p>其次，據說這次三强外長會議將討論到關於戰敗國和約的簽訂問題及和平會議問題。無論提早召集和平會議的建議，貝爾納斯是否提出，而我們於此，願先重申我們的意念，這就是：世界和平的不可分割。中美英蘇是這次反侵略戰的主要柱石。作戰時，他們並肩作戰；在世界和平的重建上，也須要他們的合作。此外，第四共和國的法蘭西，亦將爲世界和平的主要柱石之一。關於世界和平的重建，也少不了法國的協刀。爲了世界秩序的重建，五强應該如何緊密的合作起來；但不幸的是在倫敦五强外長會議時，乃有拒絕中法代表參加對某些和約討論的建議，致懸而未決。茲當三强外長召開之際，我們希望這種劃分畛域的不合理的局勢，能够糾正過來。全面戰爭之後，繼着的是全面和平，這應該少不了中法兩國的參與。</p>
<p>此外，問題還很多，如伊朗問題，巴爾幹問題，原子能管制問題等，都足以影響將來世界秩序的安定。原子能管制這個問題，其實應該不成爲什麼問題的。歷史上不能找出有永遠可以保持秘密的發明，原子能的秘密似也難逃此歷史的法則。但如今國際局勢尙未十分澄淸之際，這問題也得需要考慮。但這些都只是問題所表達出來的外表，而不是問題的核心。總括一句話，我們願國際間能够有更進一步的合作。大國與其他聯合國間不當有歧視，而大國與大國之間更不應有歧視。</p>

<p>— 素人</p>
<p>梅蘭芳先生在美琪演出是最後一天了，爲了敬愛他的藝術，就冒了夜寒作了一次訪問。</p>
<p>他的化粧室在二樓最末一間屋子裏，很寬廣，陳設得也很好。靠窗有一隻寫字檯，化裝用品以及鏡子等，就都放在那上面。有三四個人服侍他梳頭擦粉，他穿着一件黑白相間的小方格晨衣，一邊小心地化裝，一邊和站滿週四的人打招呼，無論認識不認識，他都笑着點頭，許多小姐太太們說：想不到梅先生這樣和氣。</p>
<p>化粧室裏瀰漫着一重烟霧，滿屋子的人有三分之二是女性，她們目不轉睛地看着梅先生，把一個男子改扮成女人，顯露着無限的興趣和好奇，梅先生的女兒也在，她約摸十四五歲，跟他父親一樣和氣，還說她喜歡戲劇勝于一切。</p>
<p>梅先生穿上「遊園驚夢」湖色的戲裝，我要求拍照，他欣然答應了，一位盟軍也對上鏡頭，我們一共照了三張，兩旁許多人靜靜地看着，就像在欣　一幕戲劇。</p>
<p>是「遊園驚夢」快上塲的時候了，許多人擁着梅先生下去，替他捧着鏡子·化裝盒·戲裝，就在繡幕後面擺好一桌一椅，他坐在那裏再仔細修飾。</p>
<p>我就在這裏和他隨便談着，他說他休息一個短期以後，還要演出。而且等北平的琴手來了，就可以唱平劇。他說他想念北平，但是並不預備回去，我提出中國戲劇今後應走的路，是話劇呢？還是平劇？他不願率直地回答這問題，說要好好地想一想。</p>
<p>梅先生有一個很奇怪的習慣，每次上塲以前，必定要在帘幕後凝心斂神的站上三五分鐘，他說不然上台就要錯了。</p>
<p>後台起了一陣騷動，原因是為了有三個盟軍爬在佈景板夾縫中看戲。</p>
<p>回家的途中，我想起梅先生的態度太謙和了，簡直像一個初交登合的演員，從這一份虛心，我們就能暸解他所以成名的由來。任何事業的成功，決不是偶然的，願梅先生珍重他的藝術生命，千萬觀衆都希望他給我們留下寳貴的啓示和典型。</p>

<p>本市近來車輛肇禍，日見增多，爲全市市民安全起見，改善交通管理，實屬必要。現除規定九江路漢口路已改爲單程交通外，其交通繁雜，商業熱鬧之各馬路，應多派交通警察指揮，維持秩序，此外如規定吉普卡軍用車速度，和禁止酒醉的人駕馳汽車等，以免肇禍。各馬路晚間之路燈，應設法改善，例如南京路外灘爲交通孔道，在目前車輛往來衆多，再加一路二路電車上下乘客擁擠，晚間路燈應即設法改善，增加燈光，以策交通之安全。又白畫常見外灘和四川路中正路等處，路燈依舊亮着，不知是什麽道理。希望日間路燈不要開，至晚上天黑暗的時候，把路燈開起來，同時對於現在有些馬路燈光不亮的路燈，加以改善，市民幸甚！</p>

<p>根據盟國戰犯委員會的調查，在納粹迫害的狂潮下，有五百七十萬的猶太人在歐洲失踪了。</p>
<p>據聯合社的記者在歐洲大陸上的觀察，自從戰爭結束以來，希特勒的反猶法律差不多已完全廢止。但是，種族的憎恨却仍繼續存在着。</p>
<p>由於各國政府公佈若干辦法，帮助猶太人重獲被納粹迫害剝奪掉的健康與生計。各國人民也間歇地放鬆多年宣傳所敎導他們的暴力。</p>
<p>但從奧地利的林茲，從波蘭的克拉考，從荷蘭都傳來了反猶運動的報告。</p>
<p>一座猶太敎堂被燒毀了，猶太人店舖的橱窗被打破了，苛酷的，恐怖的反猶小冊子傳佈着。</p>

<p>在另外一些國家，比如奧地利，反猶的情緒起於美軍給飢餓，生病的猶太人優先待遇。</p>
<p>在被征服的德國，呈現着一種奇異的現象。</p>
<p>過去的納粹黨徒宣稱對猶太人的友　，甚至和猶太人認親，集中營的恐怖已經消失了。</p>
<p>從每一個歐洲都城所來的報告，全說再沒有一個猶太人坐監牢了，但昔日的集中營生活仍是到處可見。全歐洲千千萬萬的猶太人還是住在營房中，睡在茅舍裏，因爲他們沒有家，沒有職業，沒有錢或任何財產，沒有家族</p>
<p>歐洲猶太人最緊急的問題，是身體的復原，對於許多猶太人，這一點已經絕望。</p>
<p>結核症，營養不良，及由奴隸　動與集中營生活引起的一長串病症，繼續脅迫着他們，雖然美軍曾救活了許多。第一批回到布達佩斯的猶太人的樣子是可怕的，但在盟軍照顯下過了幾個月以後，吃得很好，已日漸復原了</p>
<p>經濟的復原是更困難的。有幾個國家頒佈法律和指派官員負責恢復俄納粹掠奪的猶人財產。</p>
<p>某些情形下，似乎頗有進展。巧妙的納粹售賣與再售賣沒收財產的辦法，差不多不可能淸理所有權。</p>
<p>關於創造一個新生活，差不多每一國的猶太人都感覺難於着手，他們甚至連過去財產的殘餘也沒有了。</p>
<p>在奧地利和匈牙利，他們恢復的機會，比那些被殘酷壓榨的人民爲少。在比利時和法國，他們獲得平等的基礎。</p>
<p>德國和東歐猶太人的主要希望，是到巴勒斯坦去。但由於移民律和阿拉伯人的猛烈抵制，目前他們只有極少數能够達到目的</p>
<p>在所有的東歐國家中，保加利亞的情形似乎最光明。該地的猶太人約四萬七千名，在戰爭中差不多仍保此數。著名保加利亞領袖的干涉，阻止了納粹大批地放逐猶太人。戰時的反猶經濟法已經取消，猶太人已經獲得了充份地經濟和政治權利。</p>
<p>波蘭的猶太人，是歐洲最多的，而波蘭的情形也最黑暗。戰前，波瀾的猶太人有三百五十萬。現在剩下的數目是十萬到十五萬。猶太發言人說，德國人殺了三百二十萬，其餘的逃亡到別國。留在波蘭的一小部份猶太人，領導在戰爭遺跡上重建波蘭商業的工作。</p>
<p>波蘭發生過一些反猶運動，不過波蘭政府在幫着猶太人完成經濟復原。</p>
<p>奧地利猶太人的情形較難確定，因爲他們對回到維也納的猶太人數目頗有紛爭，據估計約爲三千到一萬人。</p>
<p>德國的猶太人，有權選擇他們原來的國籍或仍保持無國籍者的身份。據說百分之九十的德國猶太人，想要到巴勒斯坦去。</p>

<p>C-47運輸機的兩個巨型橡皮輪，胎中所實的壓縮空氣，共重一百八十磅。現在有人想到用氦氣來代替，氦氣比空氣輕四倍，所以用了氦氣後，兩個輪胎大槪可以减輕一百五十磅，這恰等於一個人的體重。換言之，運輸機可以多載一個人。一個人的容納量雖是小事，但也値得爭取，外國人對任何事精益求精，不肯馬虎，可見一斑。</p>

<p>這個巨砲為克虜伯廠所製，初意預備用來大破馬其諾防線，後來在塞伐斯托巴爾港圍攻時曾發揮其絕大威力，有人相信英倫海峽大砲戰中，這怪物亦曾出塲轟擊杜佛海岸。這是戰爭史上一個最大的大砲，遠勝一九一八年轟擊巴黎的那個九吋口徑遠射程砲。</p>

<p>— 勞神</p>
<p>美國一九四四年的肺癆死亡者比一九四三年减少三千人，一九四四年的死亡率是十萬人中平均死四〇·八人，前年爲四二·六人，但是美國防癆協會對國民警吿，這個統計並不一定可以樂觀，因爲根據常理，在戰時肺癆一定比較猖獗，但肺癆是慢性疾病，戰爭的影響也許要等幾年後始再顯現。美國人民生活富裕，戰時根本不曾遭受飢饉勞苦，再則防癆運動發達，X光預防檢查普遍實施，所以死亡率降低並非無因，至於我們中國，八年來當然有增無减，幸而我們沒有統計，有統計必將嚇死人，至於抵抗肺癆有賴於物質條件，倘若民窮財盡的情形不改善，即使發明了肺病特效藥也沒有用處。</p>

<p>貞雄說：「我想是的。你要知道。你並不是爲了要躲在這裏才在這裏的。』</p>
<p>那年輕人完全領會地點點頭。他簡單地說：『好吧。』</p>
<p>直到傍晚，貞雄才又去看他。天一斷黑，他就將那堅固的小船拖到岸邊，裏面放了糧食和他白天秘密地買來的幾瓶水，以及從常店裏買來的兩條棉被。他將那船繫在水裏的一根柱子上，因爲這時潮水很高。這晚沒有月亮，他工作時連手電筒都不用。</p>
<p>等他回屋裏去時，他好像正看好病回去的樣子，所以花子一點都不知道。當她服侍他吃晚飯時，她說：『今天弓子來過了。』雖然她是很現代化了。她仍不是和他一起吃飯的。她　着嘆口氣說：『弓子對着那小孩子哭了，她眞是惦記他。』</p>
<p>貞雄說：『等那外國人去了，傭人們就會回來的。』</p>
<p>那天晚上，在入睡之前，他走進了那客房，他仔細地檢查那美國人的溫度，傷口的情况，心跳和脈搏。脈搏是不正常的，不過那也許是由於興奮之故。那年輕人的蒼白的嘴脣閉得很緊，他的眼睛發火。祗有他頸上的疤痕是紅的。</p>
<p>他告訴貞雄說：『我知道你是再次在救我的命了。』</p>
<p>貞雄說：『不要謝我。我如此做。祗是因爲你再在這裏住下去很不方便而已。』</p>
<p>他對於要不要給那人一個手電筒這問題很爲猶豫。可是到底決定給他了。這是個小手電筒，是他自己的，他在出診時用的。</p>
<p>他說：『如果在你搭到船以前，食物吃完了。在太陽剛下山時，將電筒對我亮兩下。不要在黑暗裏亮，這樣會給人家看見的。如果你很安全，而仍在那島上時，向我亮一次。在那裏很容易捉到魚，可是你得吃生的。生了火就會被人看見。』</p>
<p>那年輕人透口氣說：『好的。』</p>
<p>他現在穿着貞雄給他的和服，最後貞雄拿一塊布將他的黃髮的頭包起。</p>
<p>貞雄說：『好了。』</p>
<p>那年輕的美國人一言不發，熱烈地握了貞雄的手，就走得相當穩地從房裏走下石級，走入黑暗的花園。一次—兩次—貞雄看見他亮起電簡來照照路徑。不過這是不會引人注意的。他直等到在岸邊電筒又亮了一次。於是他就關上了門窗。那晚他睡得很好。</p>

This issue has been resolved at today's meeting. In the future, when our side takes over major cities, the Soviet Army Headquarters may directly send liaison officers to accompany them. In other cities where Soviet troops are stationed, the local Soviet Army Garrison Commander will send liaison officers and assist in the takeover. Both sides have also reached an agreement on the handling of Japanese prisoners of war. Furthermore, at today's meeting, our side requested to use the Changchun Radio Station currently used by the Soviet Army. Lieutenant General Trotsenko said that he would notify us after consulting Marshal Malinovskiy.</p>

Furthermore, since November 12th of last year until recently, there have been 2,642 corruption cases, of which one-fourth were reported by the prosecutors themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Britain, the United States, and Industrially Advanced Countries Are Willing to Invest and Help Our Reconstruction; Shou Jingwei Discusses After Returning to Chongqing <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] Dr. Shou Jingwei, the employer representative of our country to this year's International Labour Conference, arrived in Chongqing by plane the other day. When he met with reporters on the 11th, he stated that capitalists in Britain, the United States, and other industrially advanced countries intend to invest in China to help China's industrialization and reconstruction. However, all countries hope that China will first achieve domestic unity, democracy, and stability, as China's industrialization is closely related to the world's employment problem. On the American side, there is now an organization called the China-US Industrial and Commercial Association, which is mainly managed by American business tycoons engaged in international trade. Its purpose is to promote cooperation between the industrial and commercial circles of China and the United States and strengthen their ties. The American side will send a business delegation to China in the spring to investigate China's current situation. American automobile king Henry Ford has recently cooperated with Ferguson to produce a small, flexible, and lightweight tractor that is very suitable for Chinese farmland. Furthermore, the United States used industrial films to train workers during the war, enabling ordinary workers to be trained as skilled workers in three weeks, whereas such training used to take three months or half a year. All of these can be learned from by our country. When I visited Britain, I met with Sir Stafford Cripps, Minister of the British Board of Trade. Cripps believed that China should do its best to promote cooperative enterprises, which are also being brewing in Britain. At this International Labour Conference, our country's representative was elected as a director, which can be regarded as clear evidence of various countries' concern for our country's industrial and commercial reconstruction. Our country should seize this good opportunity to engage in industrialization, apply scientific management methods, use European and American funds and technical assistance, and use film education to train skilled workers. The future of industrialization is always very optimistic.</p>

He will meet with Chinese officials tomorrow and leave Chongqing within the next four days.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Future Education of the Japanese Crown Prince <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Washington and Tokyo are discussing the issue of Emperor Hirohito's fourteen-year-old crown prince via confidential telegrams. Hirohito is willing to abdicate and cede the throne to his son. The United States intends to first have him receive an American-style education. The Japanese Crown Prince currently lives alone and studies at a noble school. After leaving school, he rarely meets other children, and he rarely sees even his parents. General MacArthur believes that if the Crown Prince can graduate from an American university, perhaps Harvard University, it would greatly help the hope of Japanese democracy. Even if Hirohito suddenly abdicates, it will not hinder his son from studying in the United States. Matters of governance may be handled by a regent. Keenan and General MacArthur are investigating the Japanese Emperor's war records. The Japanese Emperor may not need to be tried, but for the sake of his personal position, it would be best for him to abdicate voluntarily. The Japanese Emperor said that he felt morally responsible for the war and was therefore willing to abdicate.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Major Japanese War Criminals Collectively Surrender to Prison, Including Prince Nashimoto and Toyoda <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 12th] Twenty-two major Japanese war crime suspects surrendered to Sugamo Prison on the outskirts of Tokyo today, including leaders of the army, navy, and government, as well as major industrialists. This is the largest "collective surrender" since the US military began occupying Japan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 12th] Prince Nashimoto surrendered to Sugamo Prison at 9:00 AM this morning, the first member of the imperial family to be detained for war crimes. MacArthur's headquarters ordered the arrest of more than 50 important war criminals on the 2nd, with today as the deadline. Starting with Prince Nashimoto, people continued to surrender, arriving at the prison about every five minutes. By 10:30 AM, nine people had arrived, all carrying luggage and accompanied by representatives from the Central Liaison Office. Prince Nashimoto is a veteran of the Russo-Japanese War. The Japanese imperial court had requested MacArthur to exempt him from arrest due to his old age, but to no avail. Other prisoners who have already surrendered include former Combined Fleet Commander Toyoda; Kobayashi Seizo (formerly Commander of the Combined Fleet, once served as Governor-General of Taiwan, and served as Chairman of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association during the war); former Domei News Agency President Furuno; Mitsui industrialist Tsuda; Representative of the House of Representatives and member of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society Ida; and nationalistic educator Kikuchi.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Secretary of State Byrnes announced that General Marshall will leave for Chongqing within two days. He will depart after completing his testimony before the Pearl Harbor attack investigation committee.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] Marshal Marshall met with President Truman this afternoon for nearly an hour.

<p>Negotiations Underway for Overseas Chinese Returning to Burma</p>
<p>A foreign reporter asked whether reports that the British side refused to allow Overseas Chinese to return to their original residences in Burma were true, and what the status of Sino-British negotiations was. Vice Minister Liu replied that the Chinese government has been continuously negotiating with the British side for months regarding the return of Burmese Overseas Chinese stranded in mainland China to their original residences. The British side claimed that the transportation situation and food supply in Burma had not yet returned to their original state, so it prohibited all foreigners from entering, and there was no discrimination solely against Overseas Chinese. Currently, the Burmese returnees stranded in mainland China are experiencing extremely difficult lives. Our government is actively negotiating with the British side to allow them to return to Burma, as the return of Overseas Chinese will also benefit the economic prosperity of Burma.</p>
<p>Provincial-Level Institutions Under Government Jurisdiction</p>
<p>A foreign reporter asked how many provincial-level institutions are currently under the jurisdiction of the central government, and how the provinces and border areas in North China are divided. Councilor Zhang replied that China is currently divided into 34 provinces: Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Andong, Liaobei, Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, and Xing'an; and 8 special municipalities: Nanjing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, and Harbin. The Administrative Governor's Office (Taiwan) is also under the jurisdiction of the central government. Apart from the so-called border areas around Yan'an, there are no other border areas. Although there have been suggestions to reduce the size of provinces recently, until the government decides to adopt and implement them, the provincial boundaries of North China, Central China, and South China will remain as they were.</p>
<p>Methods of Generating Public Opinion Organs</p>
<p>A foreign reporter asked whether the Communist Party claimed that people in the border areas could freely elect representatives, and whether the election situation and the number of local public opinion organs established under the advocacy of the central government could be disclosed. Councilor Zhang replied that during the War of Resistance, in order to gather ideas and promote local autonomy, the government established provisional provincial and county councils. Generally speaking, the method of generating them was that the county government sought opinions from all French and local figures, drew up a list, and sent it to the province for approval. The provincial provisional council was generated by the provincial government drawing up a list and sending it to the central government for approval. Now the government has issued a general order to all provinces in the rear to establish formal county councils by the end of this year. Provinces with more than half of their counties establishing councils can establish provincial councils.</p>
<p>Establishment Deadline for Occupied Provinces</p>
<p>Provinces that were previously occupied should establish provisional county councils within one month of recovery, and formal councils within six months. When more than half of the counties have established formal councils, a provincial council should be established. Currently, Sichuan has 140 counties with formally elected councils, Yunnan has 55 counties, and Shaanxi has 43 counties. The provinces have more than 300 counties with formal councils, and the rest are expected to be established quickly. As for the generation of formal county councilors, they are elected freely by representatives of townships and vocational groups in a ratio of 70% and 30% respectively. Provincial councilors are elected by the county councils, one person per county, regardless of party affiliation. Provinces that have formally established provincial councils include Sichuan, Gansu, and Guizhou, according to reports.</p>
<p>Studying Exchange Rate Between Legal Tender and US Dollars</p>
<p>A foreign reporter asked whether the amount of legal tender issued could be announced. Councilor Zhang replied that the restoration work has not yet been completed, and the government does not intend to announce the issuance figures.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] A spokesman for the Executive Yuan declared that the financial authorities are "studying daily" regarding the new exchange rate between legal tender and US dollars.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Truth About Nagasaki Bombing Under Atomic Bomb <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Nagasaki, 11th] Nagasaki was bombed by the second atomic bomb on August 9th this year. US Army Medical Officer Captain Horn arrived here on September 25th. It is said that at that time, everyone was still in shock and order had not been restored. Professors and third- and fourth-year students of Nagasaki Pharmaceutical University, except for four doctors, had completely died. The bomb exploded only a few hundred yards away from the school and hospital. None of the patients, nurses, doctors, and first- and second-year students in the hospital survived. It is estimated that no less than 60,000 to 80,000 people in the city were killed, of whom 30,000 to 40,000 were burned to death in ten seconds. The rest suffered from gamma rays penetrating the bone marrow, damaging their red blood cell tissue, or suffered severe burns to the gastrointestinal tract and could not digest food, eventually dying after six weeks. The radioactivity in the embers is now no longer harmful. If one stayed at the bombing site for twelve hours in the first three or four days after the bombing, it might still have an impact, but after that, the radioactivity dissipated rapidly. Although the record paper in the Nagasaki Hospital was turned to ashes by the heat from the bomb, and the windows and medicine bottles were melted, many of the medical equipment stored in the basement were still intact. Strangely, many mattresses and iron beds in the neighboring houses were also preserved. Nagasaki's water and electricity supply has now been restored, but the gas plant has been completely destroyed. The buried corpses have a heavy odor, so there are many flies.</p>

<p>[United Press, Seoul, 11th] Kim Gu, Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government, told reporters today that he did not know when the United Nations and the US military government would recognize his provisional government as the legitimate government. He even stated that he had no idea whether his regime could be recognized at all. He said that although his group tends to be liberal and democratic, most of it is politically right-wing. When a reporter asked whether his own political ideology was right-wing or left-wing, he replied: "I don't know, let the people answer for me." The current situation in South Korea seems to be still chaotic. In addition to Kim Gu as one axis, the People's Republic of Korea is another axis, and the military government is caught between the two, with the annoyance of not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be convened in Moscow on the 15th of this month. US Secretary of State Byrnes has traveled to attend with his entourage, and the British delegation will also go to the Soviet Union. International attention is gradually shifting from Washington eastward. Since the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London in September, there have been many hidden reefs in the international situation. The world is paying attention to these reefs, but it seems that an appropriate and sound way to overcome them has not yet been found. Therefore, the convening of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference may open up a kind of deadlock.</p>
<p>The convening of this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference itself seems to be a product with inherent deficiencies. The Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London did not actually achieve much. This Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, inheriting the legacy of the London Conference, coupled with the inherent deficiencies, may not be able to be given much expectation. In fact, this is not a problem. Foreign ministers, who are in charge of the implementation of the country's foreign policy, are able to meet each other more often and exchange views. Even if there are no results, it will definitely help promote international understanding, which is naturally gratifying. But at the same time, we cannot conceal our regret. The Potsdam Conference mainly ended a wartime system and created a new system. In the effort to fight Germany, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States did bear a great burden, but that does not mean that the three powers will dominate the entire world. The post-war world needs coordination, which is no longer a military issue during wartime. Therefore, after Germany surrendered, the Potsdam Conference was convened. The countries that attended that conference certainly had some new leaders, but each other's national policies did not change due to the change of leaders. It is a natural trend to move from the Potsdam Conference to the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London. The Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference should have achieved something and should continue to be convened from time to time, but the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has evolved into the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which itself seems to be a retrograde phenomenon! We cannot help but feel regret about this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the agenda: Although the news from Moscow may not be accurate, it can be asserted that the relationship here is complex. If the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference can discuss and reach even a slight conclusion, it can pave the way for further advancement in the future. If the agenda includes discussions on European and Far Eastern issues, the absence of representatives from China and France will undoubtedly affect the acquisition of conclusions. On the issue of how to control post-war Japan, China is the first country to resist Japanese aggression. Its soil is connected, it has suffered the most, and it knows the most. China has the right to demand, and China's opinions should be respected. But now the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow does not see representatives from our country. Because of the absence of representatives from China and France, the agenda that the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference can discuss will undoubtedly be subject to certain restrictions.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is said that this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will discuss the signing of treaties with defeated countries and the issue of peace conferences. Regardless of whether Byrnes proposes the suggestion to convene a peace conference earlier, we would like to reiterate our intention here first, which is: the indivisibility of world peace. China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are the main pillars of this anti-aggression war. During the war, they fought side by side; in the reconstruction of world peace, their cooperation is also necessary. In addition, the Fourth Republic of France will also be one of the main pillars of world peace. The cooperation of France is also indispensable for the reconstruction of world peace. The five powers should cooperate closely in the reconstruction of the world order; but unfortunately, at the London Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, there was a suggestion to refuse the participation of Chinese and French representatives in discussions on certain treaties, which led to a stalemate. Now, as the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is convened, we hope that this unreasonable situation of dividing territories can be corrected. After a full-scale war, what follows is full-scale peace, which should include the participation of China and France.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other issues, such as the Iranian issue, the Balkan issue, and the issue of atomic energy control, which are enough to affect the stability of the future world order. The issue of atomic energy control should not actually become a problem. Historically, it is impossible to find an invention that can remain secret forever, and the secret of atomic energy seems difficult to escape this historical law. But now, when the international situation is not yet clear, this issue also needs to be considered. But these are just the outer appearances expressed by the problem, not the core of the problem. In a nutshell, we hope that there can be further cooperation among international countries. There should be no discrimination between great powers and other United Nations, and there should be even less discrimination between great powers and great powers.</p>

<p>Cadre School and Central Training Corps Will Be Merged</p>
<p>[Chongqing Dispatch from Dahua News Agency] The issue of the Central Political School's subordination was previously decided by the Central Standing Committee to be taken over by the government.

As a result, the Cadre School and the Central Training Corps will be merged into the large Political School, internally divided into four departments: Research, Training, University, and Specialized Courses, and subordinated to the National Government. However, there is no definite news as to whether the school name will remain "Central Political School." As for the issue of relocating the school, preparations are currently underway. Zhu Damin, the school's director of general affairs, flew to Nanjing at the end of last month to oversee the Nanjing school buildings and repair them in preparation for the temporary relocation.

<p>Yan Huiqing's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Yan Huiqing delivered the opening speech, saying that China's diplomacy was previously small and simple, and did not achieve results. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, China has become one of the major powers, and diplomacy is even more important. Therefore, national diplomacy must be emphasized even more. The General Association has been established in Chongqing, and the establishment of a branch in Shanghai is a matter of urgency. He hoped that everyone would enthusiastically promote it.</p>

<p>Returning US Troops Given Souvenirs</p>
<p>Those who are approved to return to their country can wait quietly for transportation back to their country and receive a portrait of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and a medal from our government as a souvenir of leaving China. The most busy time for the group has been in the past month. It is expected that the work will be completed in January and February next year.

<p>Senior elder Zhang Jinghu, named Renkui, had a long military career and was highly respected at home and abroad. As early as the late Qing Dynasty, he assisted the Father of the Nation in the revolution in Macau. During the Wuhan Restoration of the Xinhai Revolution, he mobilized the New Army and made remarkable achievements. During the Northern Expedition, he served as a military advisor and provided many contributions. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to his advanced age, he stayed in Shanghai and repeatedly encountered threats from the enemy and puppets. His integrity was awe-inspiring, and he was not subdued. He eventually fell ill and died of sorrow and anger at his residence in Fanwei on December 24 last year. This spring, party, government, military, business, and academic circles in the capital held a remote memorial service, attended by more than a thousand people. Chairman Chiang specially inscribed "Outstanding Reputation in the East," and the National Government specially issued an order on October 20 to commend him for his loyalty and righteousness. December 14 is the first anniversary of the death of the elder. Old friends and students, in order to commemorate his model character, have scheduled a memorial service to be held on this day at the Buddhist Temple on Gille Road to express their condolences.</p>

After the victim sneaked out of the back door and called the police to the scene, the two robbers were captured, and a pistol and six bullets were confiscated. It is reported that the house was robbed once a few days ago, resulting in a loss of 200,000 yuan in legal tender.</p>

<p>The Minjiang Shipping Company at No. 317 Hamilton Mansion previously leased the Huasheng vessel, weighing 800 tons, from the You'an Shipping Company at No. 9, 9th Floor, South Huangpu Road, to sail between Shanghai and Fuzhou, carrying cargo and passengers. At the beginning of this month, it sailed from Shanghai to Fujian, and on the 9th, it loaded sugar and native paper from Fuzhou to Shanghai. The ship had about 40 crew members and 60 to 70 passengers. At 5:30 AM yesterday, when it was sailing about ten miles away from the Wusong Estuary in the Tongsha sea area, it suddenly hit a mine, and the ship exploded and sank in an instant. At that time, two sailboats happened to be passing by and helped with the rescue. More than 40 passengers and crew members were rescued and transported to Shanghai. The rest were all drowned. After receiving the report, the company immediately sent people to Wusong Estuary to hire ships to go to the scene of the accident to find a way to salvage.

<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau has been actively carrying out repairs to important installations such as bridge foundations, bridge decks, and railings for the past two months. Among them, the repair work on the four major bridges, including Waibaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Henan Road Bridge, and Zhejiang Road Bridge, has been completed more than 80%. Waibaidu Bridge and Zhejiang Road Bridge are iron bridges and are currently being painted to prevent corrosion and consolidate the bridge structure. It is expected that all bridge projects can be completed in about two months. Regarding the wharf section, in addition to the Hongkou two postal ship wharves, which were repaired in the middle of last month, and other urgently needing repairs, the Dongchang Road Wharf (Pudong) also began construction in mid-last month. According to the wharf was badly damaged during the enemy and puppet period, and the underwater structure of the wharf was also damaged during the US Air Force's raid on Shanghai, so this project is even more difficult. Currently, a dam is being built to drain the water to a depth of six or seven feet, and then the bottom soil is dug out before the entire project can be completed. At present, the repair project of the wharf is being rushed day and night, and it is expected to be completed as scheduled by the end of the year.</p>

<p>A Month and a Half of Comforting Work</p>
<p>Central comforting official Ye Chucang met with Central News Agency reporters yesterday morning. According to him, this time, he and Niu Yongjian came to the southeast on behalf of Chairman Chiang to comfort the people of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the two municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai. They are scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a week and will meet with various legal entities and people from all walks of life to convey the central government's intentions and extend condolences. After completing the official business in Shanghai, they will go to Hangzhou, then to Zhenjiang and Nanjing, and finally to Anhui Province.

<p>Chen and Zhou, Two Traitors, Imprisoned in Tuqiao</p>
<p>He then asked reporters about the recent price situation in Shanghai and the number of arrests and disposal of traitors. After the reporters answered one by one, he told the reporters that Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai and other traitors were imprisoned in the Tuqiao Prison after being escorted to Chongqing and were completely isolated from the outside world. Therefore, the outside world cannot know about the lives of the traitors in prison. Yesterday afternoon, Ye and Niu attended Mayor Qian's banquet at the Municipal Bank. Hu Puan, Chen Lengxue, Pan Gongzhan, and others were invited to accompany them, all of whom were old friends who had worked with Ye in running newspapers in Shanghai 20 years ago.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Mei Lanfang Visited Behind the Scenes at the Majestic Theatre <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Amateur</p>
<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang's performance at the Majestic Theatre was the last day. Out of respect for his art, I braved the cold night for a visit.</p>
<p>His dressing room was in the last room on the second floor, very spacious and well furnished. There was a writing desk by the window, and makeup supplies and mirrors were placed on it. Three or four people were serving him to comb his hair and apply powder. He was wearing a black and white checkered morning gown, carefully putting on makeup, while greeting the people who filled the room. Whether he knew them or not, he nodded with a smile. Many ladies and gentlemen said: I didn't expect Mr. Mei to be so kind.</p>
<p>The dressing room was filled with smoke. Two-thirds of the people in the room were women, who watched Mr. Mei intently as he transformed a man into a woman, revealing endless interest and curiosity. Mr. Mei's daughter was also there. She was about fourteen or fifteen years old, as kind as her father, and said that she liked drama more than anything else.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei put on the lake-colored costume of "The Peony Pavilion," and I asked to take a picture. He readily agreed. An Allied soldier also joined the camera. We took three pictures in total, and many people watched quietly on both sides, as if they were admiring a scene of a play.</p>
<p>It was almost time for "The Peony Pavilion" to go on stage. Many people crowded Mr. Mei down, holding his mirror, makeup box, and costumes for him. A table and a chair were placed behind the curtain, and he sat there to carefully touch up his makeup again.</p>
<p>I talked to him casually here. He said that he would perform again after a short rest. And when the Beijing opera musicians came, he could sing Beijing opera. He said that he missed Beijing, but he was not prepared to go back. I asked what path Chinese drama should take in the future, whether it should be spoken drama or Beijing opera? He was unwilling to answer the question directly, saying that he had to think about it carefully.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei has a very strange habit. Before each performance, he must stand behind the curtain for three to five minutes with his mind concentrated. He said that otherwise he would make mistakes on stage.</p>
<p>There was a commotion backstage because three Allied soldiers were climbing in the cracks of the set to watch the play.</p>
<p>On the way home, I thought that Mr. Mei's attitude was too humble, almost like an actor who was just making his debut. From this humility, we can understand the reason for his fame. The success of any career is not accidental. I hope Mr. Mei cherishes his artistic life, and millions of viewers hope that he will leave us with valuable inspirations and models.</p>

<p>— Yong Yu</p>
<p>Recently, there have been an increasing number of traffic accidents in the city. For the safety of all citizens, it is necessary to improve traffic management. In addition to the current regulations that Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road have been changed to one-way traffic, more traffic police should be dispatched to the busy and commercial roads to direct and maintain order. In addition, regulations such as limiting the speed of jeep military vehicles and prohibiting drunk driving should be implemented to avoid accidents. The street lights on various roads at night should be improved. For example, Nanjing Road and the Bund are important transportation routes, and with the current heavy traffic and crowded streetcars, the street lights at night should be improved and the lighting increased to ensure traffic safety. Furthermore, it is common to see street lights on the Bund and Sichuan Road, Zhongzheng Road and other places still on during the day, which is incomprehensible. It is hoped that street lights will not be turned on during the day, and that they will be turned on when it gets dark at night. At the same time, the street lights that are not bright enough on some roads should be improved. The citizens would be very fortunate!</p>

<h3 id="e62">The Tragic Jews <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yikun</p>
<p>Although Hitler has been eliminated and the Nazis have completely collapsed, the tragedy of European Jews is far from over. Under the Nazi's systematic campaign of massacre and eradication, the small number of Jews who survived are now struggling with the pain of hunger and disease.</p>
<p>According to the investigation by the Allied War Crimes Commission, 5.7 million Jews disappeared in Europe under the Nazi persecution.</p>
<p>According to observations of the Associated Press reporters on the European continent, Hitler's anti-Jewish laws have been almost completely abolished since the end of the war. However, racial hatred still persists.</p>
<p>As governments announce measures to help Jews regain the health and livelihood deprived by Nazi persecution, the people of various countries also intermittently relax the violence taught by years of propaganda.</p>
<p>But reports of anti-Jewish movements have come from Linz in Austria, Krakow in Poland, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>A synagogue was burned down, the windows of Jewish shops were broken, and harsh, terrifying anti-Jewish pamphlets were distributed.</p>
<p>In some countries—such as Poland, Hungary, and France—the occurrence of anti-Jewish incidents is a resurgence of the residual toxins of Nazism, coupled with the disappearance of tolerance over the years.</p>
<p>In other countries, such as Austria, anti-Jewish sentiment arises from the preferential treatment given to hungry, sick Jews by the American military.</p>
<p>In conquered Germany, a strange phenomenon is emerging.</p>
<p>Former Nazis are claiming friendship with Jews, even forming kinship with them, and the horror of concentration camps has disappeared.</p>
<p>Reports from every European capital all say that no Jew is in prison anymore, but the former concentration camp life is still visible everywhere. Millions of Jews across Europe still live in barracks and sleep in huts because they have no home, no job, no money or any property, and no family.</p>
<p>The most urgent problem for European Jews is physical recovery. For many Jews, this is already hopeless.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis, malnutrition, and a long list of ailments caused by slave labor and concentration camp life continue to threaten them, although the American military has saved many. The first group of Jews who returned to Budapest looked terrible, but after several months of Allied care, eating well, they have gradually recovered.</p>
<p>Economic recovery is even more difficult. Several countries have enacted laws and appointed officials to restore the Jewish property plundered by the Nazis.</p>
<p>In some cases, there seems to be some progress. The Nazis' clever methods of selling and reselling confiscated property make it almost impossible to clarify ownership.</p>
<p>Regarding creating a new life, almost every Jew in every country feels it is difficult to get started. They don't even have the remnants of their past property.</p>
<p>In Austria and Hungary, their chances of recovery are less than those who have been cruelly oppressed. In Belgium and France, they have gained equal footing.</p>
<p>The main hope for German and Eastern European Jews is to go to Palestine. But due to immigration laws and fierce resistance from Arabs, only a very few can currently achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Of all the Eastern European countries, Bulgaria seems to have the brightest situation. The number of Jews in the area is about 47,000, and they have almost maintained this number during the war. The intervention of prominent Bulgarian leaders prevented the Nazis from deporting large numbers of Jews. The anti-Jewish economic laws of wartime have been abolished, and Jews have gained full economic and political rights.</p>
<p>The Polish Jews are the most numerous in Europe, and the situation in Poland is also the darkest. Before the war, there were 3.5 million Jews in Poland. The number remaining now is 100,000 to 150,000. Jewish spokesmen say the Germans killed 3.2 million, and the rest fled to other countries. The small number of Jews remaining in Poland are leading the work of rebuilding Polish commerce on the ruins of the war.</p>
<p>There have been some anti-Jewish movements in Poland, but the Polish government is helping Jews to complete their economic recovery.</p>
<p>The situation of Austrian Jews is more difficult to determine, because there is a dispute over the number of Jews returning to Vienna. It is estimated to be about 3,000 to 10,000 people.</p>
<p>German Jews have the right to choose their original nationality or remain stateless. It is said that 90% of German Jews want to go to Palestine.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Helium Tires <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Fan</p>
<p>The two giant rubber tires of the C-47 transport plane, filled with compressed air, weigh a total of 180 pounds. Now, someone has thought of using helium instead. Helium is four times lighter than air, so using helium would reduce the weight of the two tires by about 150 pounds, which is exactly the weight of one person. In other words, the transport plane can carry one more person. The capacity of one person is a small matter, but it is worth striving for. Foreigners are meticulous about everything and refuse to be careless, which is evident here.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Unprecedented Giant Cannon <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Wu</p>
<p>A giant cannon of unprecedented size was recently discovered in the forests of Bavaria, Germany. The cannon barrel weighs 1,340 tons, has a bore of 31.5 inches, and fires shells weighing 8 tons (equivalent to the largest bombs used by the Allies in this war) to a range of 30 miles.</p>
<p>This giant cannon was manufactured by the Krupp factory and was originally intended to break the Maginot Line. Later, it demonstrated its great power during the siege of Sevastopol. Some believe that this monster also appeared in the English Channel artillery battle to bombard the coast of Dover. This is the largest cannon in the history of warfare, far surpassing the nine-inch long-range cannon that bombarded Paris in 1918.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Reduced Lung Disease Mortality Rate? <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Shen</p>
<p>The number of deaths from tuberculosis in the United States in 1944 was 3,000 fewer than in 1943. The mortality rate in 1944 was an average of 40.8 people per 100,000, compared to 42.6 people the previous year. However, the American Tuberculosis Association warned the public that this statistic should not be viewed with optimism. According to common sense, tuberculosis is bound to be more rampant during wartime, but tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and the effects of war may not appear for several years. The American people are wealthy and have not suffered from famine or hardship during the war. In addition, the tuberculosis prevention movement is well-developed, and X-ray prevention checkups are widely implemented, so the reduction in mortality rate is not without reason. As for China, it has certainly increased over the past eight years. Fortunately, we don't have statistics. If we did, it would be terrifying. Resistance to tuberculosis depends on material conditions. If the situation of poverty and exhaustion of resources is not improved, even if a special medicine for lung disease is invented, it will be useless.</p>

<p>— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>"I think so. You need to know. You are not just hiding here," Sadao said.</p>
<p>The young man nodded, fully understanding. He said simply, "Okay."</p>
<p>Sadao didn't see him again until the evening. As soon as it was dark, he dragged the sturdy little boat to the shore, filling it with food, a few bottles of water that he had secretly bought during the day, and two cotton blankets bought from the usual store. He tied the boat to a post in the water, as the tide was high. There was no moon that night, and he didn't even use a flashlight while he worked.</p>
<p>When he returned to the house, he looked as if he was returning from seeing a patient, so Hana knew nothing. As she served him dinner, she said, "Yumi came by today." Although she was very modern, she still did not eat with him. She sighed and said, "Yumi cried over the little boy. She really misses him."</p>
<p>"The servants will return when the foreigner is gone," Sadao said.</p>
<p>That night, before going to sleep, he went into the guest room. He carefully checked the American's temperature, the condition of his wound, his heartbeat, and his pulse. The pulse was irregular, but that was probably due to excitement. The young man's pale lips were tightly closed, and his eyes were fiery. Only the scar on his neck was red.</p>
<p>"I know you are saving my life again," he told Sadao.</p>
<p>"Don't thank me. I am doing this only because it would be very inconvenient for you to stay here," Sadao said.</p>
<p>He hesitated over whether to give the man a flashlight, but finally decided to give it to him. It was a small flashlight, his own, which he used when making house calls.</p>
<p>"If you run out of food before you get on the boat, shine the flashlight at me twice as the sun is just setting. Don't shine it in the dark, or someone will see you. If you are safe and still on the island, shine it at me once. It's easy to catch fish there, but you'll have to eat them raw. Lighting a fire will attract attention," he said.</p>
<p>The young man breathed out, "Okay."</p>
<p>He was now wearing the kimono that Sadao had given him, and finally, Sadao wrapped a cloth around his blond head.</p>
<p>"Good," Sadao said.</p>
<p>The young American did not say a word. He warmly shook Sadao's hand, then walked quite steadily out of the room, down the stone steps, and into the dark garden. Once—twice—Sadao saw him shine the flashlight to light the path. But this would not attract attention. He waited until the flashlight shone again at the shore, then he closed the doors and windows. He slept very well that night.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Market Atmosphere Clears, Gold and Yarn Show Strength <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market was quite firm. Although there was a slight wavering in the middle, the market rallied strongly due to short covering. The struggle between bulls and bears was fierce. Large traders took a cautious approach, waiting for the re-establishment of exchange rates. The market atmosphere has turned from gloomy to clear, and the trend seems to be gradually improving. The market opened flat in the morning, but short sellers tried to salvage the situation, and the reported declines in the capital also caused a drop to 6.46 million. Strong players kept buying. Once support was established, northern buyers came in to cover their shorts, and the situation changed afterward. The market gradually forced a short squeeze. Buying sentiment was strong, and the price broke through the 7 million mark. Banks slightly sold off at higher levels, and the market then hovered around 6.8 million. As a result, the market closed 15,000 higher than the previous close. Gold jewelry was priced at 74,000, silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars declined slightly to around 420 yuan. Underground lending rates improved with the market and increasing demand, generally ranging from 10% to 12%.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: The US dollar followed the gold market's ups and downs. It initially fell from 1,080 yuan to below 1,050 yuan, but later, due to the gold market's short squeeze, it was bought up. The gloom of the past few days has been cleared, and the dollar gradually rose to 1,120 yuan, finally hovering around 1,090 yuan. As a result, it closed 20 yuan higher than the previous close. Old Hong Kong dollars did not show any significant gains or losses, while new dollars fluctuated slightly due to competition between buyers and sellers, but the final result was still one yuan higher than the previous close.</p>
<p>Securities: Public bonds initially saw profit-taking from bulls. Type C bonds fell from 550 yuan in the morning to 490 yuan. Outside investors continued to be active, and the recovery of the gold market boosted the bullish momentum. The market rebounded to above 560 yuan, and there was a slight pullback at the end, but the result was still 30 yuan higher than the previous close. Types A, B, D, and E were less affected due to time constraints and underperformed slightly. The sentiment in Chinese stocks continued to follow the gold market. The market showed signs of weakness in the middle, averaging a decline of about 10% from the previous close. After struggling for a long time, it began to recover when the gold market turned bullish. However, the results varied compared to the previous close. Yongsha rose while Meiya fell, and the three small hot stocks each fell by more than one yuan. Foreign stocks were also uncertain, with gains and losses varying. The final results were slightly up or down compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: The rice market was firm in the morning but weak in the afternoon, unable to rise. Prices were similar to the previous day. Middle and secondary grade indica rice and Duzi indica rice showed slight strength. Although oil market owners were firm, demand was normal, with slight increases ranging from several hundred to nearly one thousand yuan. The flour market was strong due to speculation about the origin of the products, and prices rebounded by 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean costs increased across the board, and retail sales were active, stabilizing the market and adding 200 to 300 yuan. Soybean cake also rebounded by 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn Market: Continued gains were seen, and customer sales were also quite active. In addition, gold prices continued to rise, further strengthening market sentiment. 20-count combed yarn rose by about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to yesterday, and sales of 16-count yarn were also very active, resulting in an increase of about 10,000 yuan compared to yesterday. Fine yarn and double-ply yarn were especially favored by Hubei and Hunan traders, rising by about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Recently, the yarn market seems to fluctuate with gold prices. Before the resumption of shipping between the north and south oceans, large-scale exports are difficult to achieve in a short time, which is a major problem for the development of the yarn market.</p>
<p>Knitted Goods: Yesterday, knitted goods dealers were eager to sell, but there were few buyers. Morning prices were similar to the previous day. In the afternoon, some people suddenly went out to buy, mainly because gold prices had risen. Generally hot-selling goods began to increase in price again. For example, Yanshou socks traded at 2,450 in the morning, but suddenly demanded 2,700 in the afternoon. Three-orange socks were asked for 3,200, but no sales were made. It is generally speculated that today's market prices will still depend on gold prices.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Yesterday's cigarette market saw gold prices rise and had been falling for many days, market sentiment turned bullish, and people were buying on dips, causing the market to flourish. British American Tobacco rebounded to 6,000 yuan in the afternoon, and Old Knife and Fairy also showed strength.</p>
