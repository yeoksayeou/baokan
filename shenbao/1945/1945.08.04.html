<h3>大島島遭艦砲射擊日軍沿岸砲應戰硫磺基地機襲關東地區</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地三日中央社電敵機動部隊一部，太月一日接近大鳥島，以艦載機數十架轟炸該島後，復以戰艦·驅逐艦·潛水艦·實行艦砲射擊，守衛該島之日軍部隊，亦以沿岸砲應戰，摧潰敵艦，使之遁走。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　硫黃島基地之敵P51日型機約一百五十架，由三日上午十時許歷約一小時半，空襲關東地區各地，主要對羣馬·茨城及京濱地區之機塲並軍事設施，交通機關　市街地帶加以攻擊，</p>
<h3>陸衛生署長談空襲救護</h3>
<p>擬訓練學生授以技能</p>
<p>南京三日中央社電上月十七·十八兩日，敵機盲炸上海，無辜民衆頗多死傷，中央陸衛生署長接報後，即赴滬視察災區狀况，慰問受傷同胞，幷協助各方辦理醫藥救護等事宜，結果頗爲圓滿，已於日昨返京，記者特往訪問，　詢滬地空襲救護情形及該署今後對醫藥救護之準備，當承略吿云：「滬地平時防空救護等設施，　甚完備，但遇空製後，其效能與理想相差頗遠，諸如運輸遲緩，救護缺乏，連絡醫生分配未能適當，均爲減少救護效能之原因，其後曾積極改善，故於二十二日遭受空襲　，損害即大形減少，各救護幽體與防空本部，均有密切連絡，而滬地市民福利協會對空襲救護工作尤盡極大力量，現該團體正　募救護金二十萬萬元，各方捐募者頗爲踴躍，想該款項日內當可募足，在戰事未結束前，今後其他各地，隨時均有遭遇空襲之可能，必須自動組成救護團體，同時本署鑒於救護人員之缺乏，擬先在首都訓練學校學生及一般民衆，授以救護技能，俾一旦遇有空襲，均能協助救護，至醫藥衛生材料，已在積極設法中，俟籌妥後，即可分配於各省市備用」。</p>
<h3>日陸大畢業生昨晋宮觀見</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電日皇陛下三日上午十時於宮中特賜見本屆陸軍大學校畢業生，是晨全體學生由校長賀屋中將率領，於上午八時五十分由坂下門進入宮城，梅津參謀總長等亦陪列，儀式整齊，靜候賜見。天皇陛下御軍裝，率同藤岡待從長，運招待從武官長等，於十時出見，對於全體畢業生之奉科，賜予答禮。</p>
<h3>重慶期鞏固戰後地位</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電</p>
<p>陝甘寗邊區之渝延武力衝突，從來常於當地暫時解決，然而此次衝突發生之後，延安方面即積極開始宜傳攻勢，並稱渝軍曾使用美國製之火箭砲，其怨恨渝方頗深，情勢不能急速解決。延安所以出此强硬態度者，乃欲將渝軍之强壓延安政策表明於世，即渝方最近一方宣傳將用政治方法解決渝延關係，一方命第三戰區軍積極實施剿共工作，並對各地區軍隊實行政治敎育，對於特務機關發出多件指令，並對和平地區宣傳，亦以延安爲漢奸，由此更可察知渝方重視對延安戰甚於對日戰。又據可靠情報稱，渝方在表面上雖極力呼號對日總反攻，然準備不見進展，因美化二十師渝軍，尤須若干歲月，故渝方似欲於總反攻開始之前，先將延安處理元畢，渝方之此種趨勢，頗似企圖於戰爭究全結束前，以武力壓倒延安，藉以淸算渝延問題，進而統一中國，以期鞏固戰後之國際地位，是以延安自不得不拼命展開其政治攻勢也。</p>
<h3>對海岸綫爭奪益烈</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　渝軍當局自於揚子江北岸安徽省南部設置第十戰區（司令長官李品仙）之後，頃復於冀察魯地區一帶新設置第十一戰區，任命前第六戰區總司令孫連仲爲該區司令長官。又據可靠之消息稱，渝方曾於本年四月在江浙兩省海岸地帶之中心地區，秘密設立蘇浙戰區，任命前第三戰區副司令長官劉建緒爲該區司令長官，渝軍此舉實欲呼應美軍，蓋因敵美大陸登陸企圖之重點，近已由華南而華東南至華東故其積極極努力加强海岸綫設施，洵屬當然之措置也。然渝之眞意，實在防止欲重登陸作戰之機而謀擴大地盤之延安，施此先發制人手段，因延安年自民國二十八年移動於陝北以來，歷經數載，業將其勢力漸次伸展，蠢食華北之渝軍地區，其先鋒已進至以淮海爲中心之華北海岸錢一帶。且於華中方面，延安之遊擊軍亦進至蘇中及江南地帶，執拗繼續擴大地盤工作，展開其有組織之大規模行動，爲準備美軍登陸，乃急於侵入海岸地帶，以期美軍登陸後，將華中沿岸之富饒地帶收歸其支配之下，渝方對此，遂不得不採取對抗之措置也，</p>
<h3>日軍決然護守大陸</h3>
<p>而子學忠之　蘇戰區，因日軍不斷施行描蕩戰，致於大東亞戰前已喪失其實力，及後，日軍之山柬作戰即轉爲整滅共匪。又冀戰區自從中原會戰以來，殆已喪失其戰力，其後，日軍於該方面之作戰，即轉爲肅淸延安側之晋　魯豫邊區及晋冀察邊區。此時於華北之渝軍，實力已顯見削弱，延安軍乃乘虛而入，擴大勢力範團，且欲乘美軍登陸，而坐收漁人之利，此點渝方自極爲明瞭，更於最近由武漢地區向楊子江沿岸東漸之延安軍意欲使揚子江流城變爲一大赤色，已迂迴逐向海岸附近地帶移動，故渝方新設之第十戰區，係爲防止沿岸軍之東進，業布成防衛綫。當此渝延雙方飲舞美軍於大陸登陸之空氣日益濃厚之際，而兩者對海岸綫之爭奪，亦益趨激烈，日本大陸派遣軍無論渝延兩軍之相爭如何，決然護守大陸，逕向擊滅英美並與此策動者之途上邁進，以達成聖戰目的。</p>
<p>旅行通訊</p>
<h3>實應一瞥</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>高郵寳應兩地，相隔僅一百廿里，雖云近在咫尺，奈以目前交通不便，水路運河高寳段河身淤淺，深僅及膝，輪船行駛，每易擱淺，故內河輪船公司之高寳定期班，停開已久。據鄉人吿，盤據運河之上游新四軍在淮安淸江一帶，築有寬約里許之大閘，河水被阻，致造成河身淤淺現象。</p>
<p>陸路之運堤公路，年來治安堪慮，尤以目前蘇北各縣新麥登塲，割據沿途之遊擊隊，故造恐怖局面，以阻和平區糧食之收買工作，此種情况，近更猖獗，記者七月五日從揚州甫抵郵城之日，聞是日公路客車，於界首附近遭刦，旅客中一婦人喪生，軍人六人被架，據謂刦車者乃新四軍之民兵機幹隊。</p>
<p>九日晨記者由郵城北門外碼頭搭乘小汽車（私人經營之載客小汽車，前此華鐵本有公共汽車行駛，奈以車輛與燃料俱缺，故去冬即行停止。）車主以奇貨可居對旅客索價漫無標準，商榷者再，終以六萬元成交。車於八時開行，全車內外總計十二人，故駛行至緩，一小時許抵兩縣縣境交界處之介首（高郵屬），汜水（實應屬），以地屬危險區，爲安全起見，旅客至此皆下車步行，冒充普通行人，參雜於鄕人之間，汽車則由常地軍人持槍保護急駛而過，步行里許，至氾水重新登車，從此一路無阻，再一時又半，車達寳應西門城外。</p>
<p>寳應街頭</p>
<p>寳應城垣校高郵小，當地名勝頗多，如靜處新馬路東端的畫川書院，樹本蓊鬱，據謂此書院乃明代顯官的園林，其中有山，有湖，景色至佳。此外古蹟有歷史悠久的害代古松，漢代袁術之墓，都爲這大運河東岸的靜寂的小城實應增色不少。</p>
<p>寳應城中祇有東西的「大馬路」（即新馬路），及南北的「長街」。均長約一里許，除大馬路外，其餘之街道類皆以整塊大石板舖砌而成，城內房屋頗多巍峨的大庭園，有着深寬的八字門牆。保持着一世紀前舊日門閥的莊嚴。</p>
<p>蘇北出產之生汕與荳油，運往鎭江，銷售江南，以寳應爲的中繼地，故城區北油部行至夥，南部則爲糧行之集中地。</p>
<p>罷市風潮</p>
<p>過去駐　應縣城的隊伍，係前廿二師馬又銘一團，爲時年餘，軍紀欠　，常有勒索之事，民衆不堪其擾，相率罷市，控之上峯，旋奉令調防興化，移防時行經三　之東新莊地帶，此擾民有餘，戰鬥無力之軍隊，即被新四軍機械，此本年三月間事也。</p>
<p>本年春季蘇北綏靖公署，委江廉淸氏爲寳應縣長，雖馬團已去，但苛導後，始陸續開市，苛捐亦大部撤銷。近江氏體念本縣漁夫及人力車夫之生活堅苦，又下令　免漁稅及人力車</p>
<p>寳應縣政</p>
<p>寳應江縣長就任以來，對寳應之縣政頗多改革，尤其對該縣民衆生活等問題，寗且注意。以衛生言，江氏已命令調查，關係民衆衛生至巨之「市河」。並親赴各段視察，實施疏溶工作，俾利民欲，再以時屆夏令時疫業生之際，故縣府最近已派員赴楊州採購大批疫苗，供居民注射。</p>
<p>以教育言，七月十一日召開全縣保甲委員會時，席上議決，着令本縣民衆敎育館及民衆圖書館，從速各辦民衆義務學校一所。又曾於五月下旬爲提倡國學起見，舉行全縣中小學學生作文比賽。</p>
<p>爲安定警察生活，革除過去向民衆勒索之惡習，本年四月起，會改善本縣警務人員之待遇，裁汰冗員，提高素質，其待遇則規定每名警士按月津貼食米三斗，菜金四千四百元。</p>
<p>關於水利增產問題，曾協力開闢水源，在寳應三官殿南運西堤壩，已着手開挖，現已完工，此舉可引湖濟運（高郵湖），暢通水流，對農田之俾益非淺，至他處工稅，亦在陸續進行中。</p>
<p>有關調節民食軍需之公糧倉庫，近已正式成立，委徐益儉爲主任，負責主持。</p>
<p>治安與掃蕩</p>
<p>現寳應駐軍除縣保安隊外，並有第二方而軍之第　　師，故城區維持治安實力頗爲雄厚。但城郊數里外時有遊擊隊出現，目下每日六時城門禁閉，夜半時聞遊擊隊之示威槍聲。</p>
<p>六月二十七日駐山陽溝之木縣保安隊，與匪軍獨立第五團發生激戰，斬獲頗多。事後曾蒙蘇北綏署孫主任電獎，七月三日夜半，洪湖之水上警察大隊，在湖濱港口發規匪軍一隊，希圖混入港內，當即發生惡戰，終由王繼勝班長率領，奮勇擊退。</p>
<p>農村現况</p>
<p>寳應全縣分八區，人口總計四二八·七九二人，濃民佔絕大多數，全　面積汁二一·二三六六·九〇〇公畝，耕地面積爲一〇·八八一·〇〇〇公畝，耕田佔總面積之百分比率爲五一·二。農產物以稻爲大宗，麥次之，又寳應之藕粉素負盛名（年產五〇〇担）。生活以地較偏僻，走私不便，故物價較高郵爲低。七月十日當地物價，大約如此：</p>
<p>米價最上等者，每担一百五十斤計廿七八萬元，猪肉每斤一千八百元，生油每斤六千四百元（老秤），火柴五百五十元一匣，國光皂每連兩千四百元，「常州江布」每尺二千三百元，白洋布每尺六千元。</p>
<p>記者爲探求當地郊區之農村現况起見，曾冒險隨鄕人前往距城二十里之北鄉張橋鎭，實地考察，按該地爲新四軍之勢力範圍，據老農吿記者，鎭上居民，常被　往開「民衆大會」，事後又須將開會情形向駐軍報告，故有時往返甚爲忙碌。新四軍之模範隊與民兵隊會同合作社，收買農作物，全以「抗幣」支付，其與中儲劵之比例，爲一與五百之比率，以實際上之需要，故其票面有如郵票臨時加戳，增高其票値，漫無止境，農民至感痛苦。</p>
<p>至捐稅，農民每畝委須付麥十五斤，稻以客歲官每畝爲三十五斤。今年以未至收穫期，故未定，「供應柴」每畝田須交柴三斤。</p>
<p>災荒一斑</p>
<p>張橋鎭之稻與麥皆係一季，前此當地僅稱此兩種作物，今歲則因四月初，發現蝗虫，致迄今麥及稻秧，皆被損害，其損失在五成以上。據農人云，最奇着照按理客冬該鎭嚴寒，蝗虫之十，理宜凍斃，今年大批爲患，實出意料之外。</p>
<p>旱而兼蟲，當地農民多將稱麥田改種黃豆綠豆赤豆，此項豆類，須陰歷八九月始能收割，至本年四月麥之收成，僅及往年之半。大麥僅收每畝七八斗，小麥母畝三四斗，去年稻之收成每畝約一担，今年則不堪設想矣</p>
<p>又當地以氣候與地點關係，麥大致於陰曆九月間下種，因天寒生長至緩，須至次年五月始能收，稻則類多五月插秧，八月中收割。田畝價格，近水口者每畝約二十萬元，次者約十萬元。</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>再論轉變上海風氣</h3>
<p>— 金雄白</p>
<p>前日本報代論「轉變上海風氣」，陳彬龢先生就過去迭次籌款失敗的實例，表示無限的憤慨，因爲我也是追隨諸前輩，參與其事之一，也有同樣的感想，現在正是救人救己最重要的關頭，因此不嫌辭費，爲文再申論之。</p>
<p>上海的一般中上社會階級，尤其是所謂紳富之流，一向自命是愛國愛民，正氣磅礴，在淸談之際，每每大義凜然，這樣的民氣，自然是値得欽佩。但空皆救國，世界似尙無此種先例，戰事逾緊張，乘機積資的也逾多，而口頭上的高調也逾利害，大家認爲戰事的結束，爲期不遠，祗要手頭有錢，將來儘可安享淸福，血讓人家去流，天坍下來有人家去撑持，祗要自己有一番反對現實，厭惡環境的表示，就無愧爲中華民國之國民，就可在混亂局面中安然渡過。假使這樣現象延續下去，這種風氣擴張下去，無論這次戰爭之誰勝誰敗，一向以自命領導全國人才薈萃的上海，有這樣使人絕望的事實，中國的前途是絕對悲觀的。</p>
<p>也有人曲爲解說，以爲過去的許多次募款，多少含一些政治性，出錢事小，將來「天亮」以後，或許反以此牽涉受累。這樣的深謀遠慮，目的僅在諉卸責任，我自然沒有話說，假若以此爲唯一正當之理由，未免幼稚可笑。譬如第一次警察消費合作社　款，僅僅爲了維護治安，換句話說也就是間接在謀保護我們自己的身家性命，第二次的救濟庫劵爲了救濟疏散之用，第三次的江蘇農貸，一而在防止共匪的活動，一面在接濟上海的民食，最近的救濟空襲，更是人類互助應有的舉措，與現政治有什麼關連？與出資的前途有什麼牽涉？彬龢先生認爲這是顯示民間力量的脆弱，我認爲這是民間道德的墮落，這是民氣的消沉，實在令人心</p>
<p>我很想貢獻一些有錢有力人們一些人人看得到想得到的淺見，戰事自然有結束的一天，但耍請上海自命智慮過人的紳富階級，睜開了慧眼看看上海的環境，美國軍隊的大陸作戰，共產黨的環伺四郊，敵美飛機的盲目轟炸，正如周市長前天在市政諮詢委員會席上所報吿的「現在命運却註定上海市民，不能不經騐這個悲慘的生活了」，請上海人三復斯言，事實不會這樣簡單的會讓你安安穩穩的度過難關，永久享受淸福。在這一個命運中，不要說財產能不能保持尙在其次，生命的能不能苟全，還是個狠大的問題，不要到了生命的臨了，方始懊悔生前沒有對社會稍盡一些力量，不要等到最後的一呼吸時方始覺得要出錢出力嫌得太遲了，匹夫無罪，懷　其罪，在亂世時代，有錢者未必便會有福。</p>
<p>我覺得這種事實、可笑；譬如五萬萬億元的救濟庫合之黃金，目前不過五十兩，當時也不過多一倍。其價値不過頂一所普通的房屋，而合全上海社會領袖之力，經數閱月之久，總數尙不足五分之四，况且實際拿出的還只其中的三分之一，我想上海有力量以四條至八條金條頂得起房屋的祗少有十萬人以上，而對於公益的事情，如此漠視，上海悲慘的命運，眞是註定了嗎？又如這一次救濟空襲的捐款，頭幾次在連績轟炸的時候，一時覺得自已的生命受得威脅，或者一時爲了情感的衝動，捐款尙稱踴躍，這幾天來各方面又似乎事過境遷了，同時請查一查捐款人的姓氏，有幾位是上海的紳富，難道上海一切的人們，一定要輪到自己的頭上，方　覺得爲善　遲嗎？</p>
<p>以上海黃金股票市塲每天營業數額的鉅大，祗要能有十份之一的款項，一定可以百廢俱舉，但是上海有幾個這樣的有心人呢？</p>
<p>要救上海，要救自己，一定要靠自己的力量，一定要靠上海全體市民集合起來的力量，現在不是空談愛國袖手旁觀的時候了，災難將臨到每個人自己的頭上，要避免這一次的浩刧，就看我們自已的怎樣努力了。</p>

<h3>外長理事會設英　九一以前舉行首次會</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電波次坦三國會議，二日發表最後共同宣言，其要旨如下：</p>
<p>三國會議之結果，爲準備與戰敗諸國締結和約，並爲得以担當上述目的之德國政府成立後，與德國計劃和平的處理起見，決定組織外長理事會。該理事會由英國·蘇聯。重慶，法國並美國之外長加人，理事會設於倫敦，第一次會議決定於九月一日以前舉行，理事會常設事務局於倫敦，其重要任務爲起草與義大利·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞·洪牙利及芬蘭之　和條約，提交聯合國並賦以提出處理歐戰終了時未解決各事項之提案權限，理事會於德國國內有充分能担任此目的之政府成立時，應準備與德國之和平處理案，以上五國以外之各國，視討論事想之內容，亦得請其派代表出席，尤其於討論法國·意大利之和平開始時，應請他國代表參加。該會雖邀請法國，重慶參加，然英·美·蘇三國仍保留「三國討論」之權利。關於德國問題，協定政治的，經濟的各原則如下：</p>
<h3>甲·政治原則</h3>
<p>德國國內之權利，由英·美·蘇·法四國最高司令各於其佔領地，根據本國政府之訓令行使之，並得以管理理事會會員之立場共同行使之。　關於德國人民之處理，儘可能全德劃一辦理。　佔領目的。爲全面解除德國武裝，阻止其今後軍需生產，使德國和平協力於將來之國際生活，　廢一切納粹活動之黨員均加驅逐，使離開責任地位，爲達到上述目的，援助德全國基於民主主義原則，尤其實行普選，復活地方自治制度，申言之，聯合國將援助一切民主主義制度之復活，暫時不設立中央政府，但關於財政·運輸通信·貿易及工業，則設置中央行政官　，准許言論·出版·信教自由。並尊重宗敎機構，强化工會。</p>
<h3>乙·經濟原則</h3>
<p>爲除去德國戰爭之潛勢力起見，禁止武器，彈藥及其他軍需機械，一切航空機，船舶之製造，直接有關戰爭經濟之工業，加以嚴重統制，不必要之生產力，依照賠償計劃撤消破壞之，爲掃除托辣斯，卡推兒，辛狄凱脫等德國經濟力之過分集中，儘可能從速分散德國經濟，復興經濟之重點，置於農業及和平的國內產業之發展。在佔領期間內，德國領土作爲單一的經濟單位處理，關於財政經濟政策，則確立聯合國至共同政策。對於德國國民，承認其不越過歐洲各國平均生活水準之生活標準，並立即進行適當措置，以修復運送機關，增加煤斤生產，確保最大限度農產，修理人民住宅，管理聯合各國未加扣押之德國國有之外國資產，辦理之時，當存留德國人民藉以生活之資源。</p>

<h3>市長訓詞</h3>
<p>周市長代表詞謂：今天是自警團本部主辦幹部人員集中訓練的畢業典禮，各位團員能以堅毅的精神丟開看私人的一切事務，冒着炎熱共同來受嚴格的訓練，而且都有始有終，渡過了相當的受訓時期。這一點是値得讃佩的。各位從今天起已經是一個眞正的幹部人才，也就是變成了全市四十五萬自警團團員的中堅份子。同時正當諸位由集訓團完成了訓練的時候，時局更較以前緊張起來，所以各位擔當的責任是非常重大，而一切所受的訓練，也需要付諸實踐。</p>
<p>最近敵機空襲上海市區，無辜的民衆時當遭過災難，諸君是地方自警自衛的幹部份子，對於目前的狀態是不得不有深切的警　。</p>
<p>本市各區自警團雖然空襲時期盡了最大的力量，流了無數血汗，爲地方服務，舉凡消防救傷等項都非常活躍努力，但是尙有許多地力不能達到理想，在各項工作效能上亦不能發揮更宏偉的力量，這都是由於缺乏幹部人才而不能指揮運營的緣故。現在諸君受了嚴格的訓練，在精神上體魄上都有了很多進步，今後我們對於幹部人才的期待實在至深且不能避免，而且更有加强轟炸的可能，無非是一種恐怖的威脅手段，難免影響治安。但是我們的生命財產都寄託在此，我們確信本市的自警團員都能深刻了解保衛地方治安的使命，再由於幹部諸君力量的滲入，必能應付敵人的謀略，而協助當局確保大上海的治安。</p>
<p>所以在今天諸君舉行畢業的典禮中本人願一智仁勇三自贈與諸君，因爲孔子說過：「智者不惑，仁者不憂，勇者不懼。」在這個戰火遍地時局緊迫的時期，我們務須以大智大勇來應付當前難關，更以大仁來爲地方及市民服務，這是本人願與諸君共勉的。</p>

<h3>劉局長談經濟局最近工作重心　記者例會中答覆問題</h3>
<p>市宣傳處主辦之記者例會，於昨日上午十時半在市府舉行，由市經濟局劉局長出席，曾就管理戰時物價，强化各業公會，各種戶口配給，主要商品登記等問題，答覆各報社記者所訽棊詳。茲分誌如下：</p>
<h3>物價問題</h3>
<p>（問）經濟局最近重心工作可見吿一二否？</p>
<p>（答）本局重要工作計分：　工商登記，　指導管理同業公會，　主要商品登記，　物價之管理，　農業生產之督導，　物品配給。</p>
<p>（問）物價評議會最近已核定之物品價格，商店遵照實行者似屬絕無僅有，如皮鞋牙膏等欲照限價絕難購到，經局對此之意見如何？</p>
<p>（答）物價評議，非常困難，低則難於執行，高則有違評價之本旨，且左右物價之因素，異常複雜，非標本兼施，難收實效。本局對此非常注意，評定價格難以實行，及不能以限價購到商品之原因乃爲物價變動頻繁之故。</p>
<p>（問）邇來一般物價又復飛漲，經濟局擬如何處置以安民生？</p>
<p>（答）物價飛　雖有種種原因，然生活指數　高，商人不謀正常利益，以致一部份囤積取巧者，均爲最大因素。本局奉實業部長電飭急籌對策，正請示當局，並與有關方面聯絡辦理中。</p>
<h3>强化公會</h3>
<p>（問）强進行至何種程度？</p>
<p>（答）本市各商業種類繁多，過去公會組織有未盡健全者，每有同業互相爭競，請求組織公會，糾紛迭起，即經調查其性質種類，加以調整指導或歸併。現已經組織核准成立之公會，計有二百六十一單位，在改組中者計十一單位。至强化公會辦法：　　訂等級，　調查組織是否健全，　嚴禁操縱把持，　擇要改組或合併以爲調整之標準。</p>
<h3>戶口配給</h3>
<p>（問）各種戶口配給時斷時續經濟局對此有無改進計劃？</p>
<p>（答）戶口配給，不能按期，實以物資來源缺乏，本局無時不在與有關方面洽辦中。最近準備辦理戶口雜糧配給，至戶口麵粉及日用品並未中斷，以後新殼登塲當較爲順利</p>
<p>（問）主要商品登記目前情形如何？</p>
<p>（答）主要商品登記前經呈准實業部限期（本年四月十六日至五月十五日）辦理，其品目範圍，計分八種：</p>
<p>維，　化學工業，　五金，　電氣器具，　皮革原料，　白報紙，以上八種商品，計有關三已登記竣事正在統計中。</p>

<h3>紀念亡父捐款救災</h3>
<p>盟邦人士堤博君來函云：「本月二日是我父親在中國病死後的七週忌日，照日本的習慣，一定要做一次盛大的法事，可是我願意做一件有價値的事，留個紀念，因此我把這捐助飛機餘下的二十萬元，作爲貴國的空襲救濟金，區區之數，聊表親善之意。」</p>
<h3>市佛敎會協助救災</h3>
<p>本市佛敎會鑒於目前空　救濟工作，業由上海市民福利協會統籌進行，該會爲協助救濟事宜，爰特分別通知全市各大業林寺院，如該寺院區內附近市民遭遇空襲，各寺院盡量開放收容被災難民，同時該會並籌　組織佛敎救護隊，擔任空襲救護事宜。</p>

<h3>Great Bird Island Subjected to Naval Bombardment, Japanese Troops Respond with Coastal Artillery, Iwo Jima Base Aircraft Attack Kanto Region</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Central Pacific Base, 3rd: A portion of enemy mobile forces approached Great Bird Island on the 1st. After bombing the island with several dozen carrier-based aircraft, they proceeded to conduct naval bombardment with battleships, destroyers, and submarines. The Japanese troops guarding the island also responded with coastal artillery, destroying enemy ships and causing them to retreat.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: Approximately one hundred and fifty enemy P-51 fighter planes from the Iwo Jima base, from around 10:00 AM on the 3rd, for about an hour and a half, conducted air raids on various locations in the Kanto region, primarily targeting airfields, military facilities, transportation hubs, and urban areas in Gunma, Ibaraki, and the Keihin region.</p>
<h3>Director of Army Medical Administration Discusses Air Raid Relief</h3>
<p>Plans to Train Students and Impart Skills</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd: On the 17th and 18th of last month, enemy aircraft indiscriminately bombed Shanghai, resulting in many innocent civilian casualties. Upon receiving the report, the Director of the Central Army Medical Administration immediately went to Shanghai to inspect the disaster area, comfort injured compatriots, and assist in medical relief efforts. The results were quite satisfactory. He returned to Nanjing yesterday. Reporters visited him specifically to inquire about the air raid relief situation in Shanghai and the administration's future preparations for medical relief. He briefly stated: "Shanghai's peacetime air defense and relief facilities were quite comprehensive, but after experiencing air raids, their effectiveness fell far short of expectations. Issues such as slow transportation, lack of ambulances, and improper allocation of liaison doctors all contributed to reduced relief effectiveness. Active improvements were subsequently made, so the damage from the air raid on the 22nd was greatly reduced. Various relief organizations and the Air Defense Headquarters maintained close contact. The Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association has made especially great efforts in air raid relief work. Currently, the organization is raising 200,000,000 yuan for relief funds, and donations from all sides are quite enthusiastic. It is expected that the funds will be fully raised within days. Before the end of the war, other locations are likely to experience air raids at any time, so it is necessary to automatically form relief organizations. At the same time, in view of the lack of rescue personnel, our administration plans to first train students and the general public in the capital, imparting rescue skills so that they can assist in rescue efforts in the event of an air raid. As for medical and hygiene supplies, we are actively seeking ways to obtain them and will distribute them to various provinces and cities for reserve use once arrangements are made."</p>
<h3>Graduates of the Japanese Army Academy Received an Audience with the Emperor Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 2nd: His Majesty the Emperor granted a special audience to the graduates of this year's Army Academy at the Imperial Palace at 10:00 AM on the 3rd. That morning, all the students, led by Academy President Lieutenant General Kaya, entered the Imperial Palace through the Sakashita Gate at 8:50 AM. Chief of the General Staff Umezu and others also accompanied them. The ceremony was orderly, and they waited quietly for the audience. His Majesty the Emperor, in military uniform, accompanied by Chief Chamberlain Fujioka and Adjutant Officer Chief, appeared at 10:00 AM and gave a salute to all the graduates.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Aims to Consolidate Post-War Position</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd:</p>
<p>The armed conflicts between the Chongqing and Yan'an forces in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have typically been resolved temporarily in the area. However, after this latest conflict, Yan'an actively launched a propaganda offensive, claiming that the Chongqing army used American-made rocket launchers, indicating their deep resentment towards Chongqing, making a quick resolution difficult. Yan'an's hardline stance aims to expose Chongqing's policy of suppressing Yan'an to the world. While Chongqing recently promoted a political resolution to the Chongqing-Yan'an relationship, they simultaneously ordered the Third War Zone troops to actively implement communist suppression efforts, conduct political education for troops in various regions, issued multiple directives to intelligence agencies, and promoted propaganda in peaceful areas, labeling Yan'an as traitors. This reveals that Chongqing prioritizes the war against Yan'an over the war against Japan. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, Chongqing superficially promotes a general counter-offensive against Japan, but preparations are not progressing because the beautification of the 20th Division of the Chongqing army will require several years. Therefore, Chongqing seems to want to eliminate Yan'an before the general counter-offensive begins, resolve the Chongqing-Yan'an issue, and then unify China to consolidate its international position after the war. Therefore, Yan'an has no choice but to desperately launch its political offensive.</p>
<h3>Competition for Coastlines Intensifies</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: After establishing the Tenth War Zone (Commander-in-Chief Li Pinxian) on the north bank of the Yangtze River in southern Anhui Province, the Chongqing authorities recently established the Eleventh War Zone in the Hebei-Chahar-Shandong area, appointing former Sixth War Zone Commander-in-Chief Sun Lianzhong as the zone's Commander-in-Chief. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, Chongqing secretly established the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War Zone in the central area of the coastal regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in April of this year, appointing former Third War Zone Deputy Commander-in-Chief Liu Jianxu as the zone's Commander-in-Chief. Chongqing's move is intended to coordinate with the U.S. military because the focus of the enemy's (U.S.) mainland landing attempts has recently shifted from South China to Southeast China and East China, so it is natural for them to actively strengthen coastal facilities. However, Chongqing's true intention is to prevent Yan'an from seizing the opportunity to reland and expand its territory. Since Yan'an moved to northern Shaanxi in 1939, they have gradually expanded their influence over the years, encroaching on the Chongqing-controlled areas of North China. Their vanguard has advanced to the coastal areas of North China centered on Huaihai. In Central China, Yan'an's guerrillas have also advanced to the areas of central Jiangsu and Jiangnan, stubbornly continuing to expand their territory, carrying out organized large-scale actions. In preparation for the U.S. landing, they are eager to invade the coastal areas, hoping to bring the rich areas along the coast of Central China under their control after the U.S. landing. Chongqing had no choice but to take counter-measures.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Determined to Protect the Mainland</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu War Zone under Zhi Xuezhong lost its actual strength before the Greater East Asia War due to continuous suppression operations by the Japanese army. Later, the Japanese army's Shandong operations were transformed into completely eliminating the communist bandits. Since the Central Plains Campaign, the Hebei War Zone has almost lost its combat power. Later, the Japanese army's operations in that area were transformed into clearing the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region and the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region on the Yan'an side. At this time, the strength of the Chongqing army in North China was visibly weakened, and the Yan'an army seized the opportunity to enter and expand its sphere of influence, intending to reap the benefits of the fisherman while the U.S. army lands. Chongqing is very aware of this, and the Yan'an army, which has recently gradually moved eastward from the Wuhan area along the Yangtze River, intending to turn the Yangtze River basin into a vast red area, has also detoured and gradually moved toward the coastal areas. Therefore, the newly established Tenth War Zone by Chongqing is to prevent the coastal army from advancing eastward and has formed a defense line. As the atmosphere of Chongqing and Yan'an competing for the U.S. army to land on the mainland becomes increasingly intense, the competition between the two for the coastline is also becoming increasingly fierce. Regardless of the conflict between the Chongqing and Yan'an armies, the Japanese Continental Expeditionary Army is determined to protect the mainland and directly advance on the path to defeat Britain and the United States and those who instigate them, in order to achieve the sacred war's objective.</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Worth a Glance</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Gaoyou and Baoying are only one hundred and twenty li apart. Although they are close at hand, current transportation is inconvenient. The canal section of the waterway between Gaoyou and Baoying is silted up and shallow, only knee-deep. Steamships easily run aground, so the regular Gaoyou-Baoying line of the inland river steamship company has been suspended for a long time. According to locals, the New Fourth Army, entrenched upstream of the canal in the Huai'an-Qingjiang area, has built a large dam about one li wide, blocking the river water and causing the riverbed to silt up.</p>
<p>The transport embankment highway on land has been a cause for concern in recent years, especially since new wheat is being harvested in various counties in northern Jiangsu. Guerrilla forces along the route are creating a terrifying situation to prevent the purchase of grain in the peaceful areas. This situation has become even more rampant recently. On July 5th, when I arrived in Youcheng from Yangzhou, I heard that a passenger bus on the highway was robbed near Jieshou that day. A woman among the passengers was killed, and six soldiers were abducted. It is said that the robbers were militia cadres of the New Fourth Army.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, I boarded a small car (privately operated passenger car; in the past, China Railways had public buses operating, but due to a lack of vehicles and fuel, the service was suspended last winter) at the wharf outside the north gate of Youcheng. The car owner, capitalizing on the scarcity of vehicles, demanded exorbitant fares from passengers without any standard. After repeated negotiations, we finally agreed on 60,000 yuan. The car departed at 8:00 AM, carrying a total of twelve people inside and out, so the journey was slow. After about an hour, we arrived at Jieshou (under the jurisdiction of Gaoyou), where the two counties meet (Baoying is actually under jurisdiction). Because the area is considered dangerous, passengers were asked to get off the car and walk for safety, pretending to be ordinary pedestrians mixed in with the locals. The car, protected by armed soldiers, sped through. After walking about one li, we reboarded the car at Fanshui. From there, the road was clear, and after another hour and a half, the car arrived outside the west gate of Baoying.</p>
<p>Streets of Baoying</p>
<p>The city walls of Baoying are higher than those of Gaoyou. There are many local scenic spots, such as the Huachuan Academy, quietly located at the east end of Xinma Road, with lush trees. It is said that this academy was a garden of a prominent official in the Ming Dynasty, with mountains and lakes, making for excellent scenery. In addition, historical sites include the ancient pine trees of the Harm Dynasty with a long history and the tomb of Yuan Shu of the Han Dynasty, all of which add a lot to the quiet small town on the east bank of the Grand Canal.</p>
<p>In Baoying city, there is only the east-west "Dama Road" (i.e., Xinma Road) and the north-south "Changjie". Each is about one li long. Except for Dama Road, the rest of the streets are paved with large stone slabs. There are many magnificent courtyards in the city, with deep and wide eight-character door walls, maintaining the solemnity of the old families of a century ago.</p>
<p>Raw peanut oil and soybean oil produced in northern Jiangsu are transported to Zhenjiang and sold in southern Jiangsu, with Baoying as a transfer point. Therefore, the oil firms are concentrated in the north of the urban area, while the grain firms are concentrated in the south.</p>
<p>Strike Wave</p>
<p>The troops stationed in Baoying County in the past were the 1st Regiment of Ma Youming of the former 22nd Division. For more than a year, military discipline was lacking, and there were frequent extortion incidents. The people could not bear the disturbance and went on strike together to appeal to the higher authorities. Then they were ordered to be transferred to Xinghua. When they were transferred through the Dongxinzhuang area of Sanjie, this army, which was more than enough to disturb the people but unable to fight, was mechanized by the New Fourth Army. This happened in March of this year.</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, the North Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office appointed Jiang Lianqing as the magistrate of Baoying County. Although the Ma Regiment had left, the people gradually resumed business after suffering from extortion, and most of the arbitrary levies were also abolished. Recently, Jiang sympathized with the hard lives of the fishermen and rickshaw pullers in the county and ordered the fishermen's tax and rickshaw tax to be abolished.</p>
<p>Baoying County Administration</p>
<p>Since Jiang took office as the magistrate of Baoying, he has reformed the county's administration a lot, especially paying attention to the problems of the people's livelihood in the county. In terms of hygiene, Jiang has ordered an investigation into the "City River", which is closely related to the people's hygiene, and personally inspected each section and implemented dredging work to benefit the people's desires. In addition, as the summer season is approaching and epidemics are occurring, the county government has recently sent personnel to Yangzhou to purchase a large number of vaccines for residents to inject.</p>
<p>In terms of education, at the county-wide Baojia Committee meeting on July 11, it was resolved that the county's Public Education Center and Public Library should each quickly establish a public compulsory school. In addition, in order to promote national studies, a writing competition for students in primary and secondary schools in the county was held in late May.</p>
<p>In order to stabilize the lives of the police and eliminate the bad habits of extorting money from the people in the past, starting from April of this year, the treatment of police officers in the county has been improved, redundant personnel have been eliminated, and the quality has been improved. The treatment stipulates that each police officer will receive a monthly subsidy of three dou of rice and 4,400 yuan for vegetables.</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of water conservancy and increased production, efforts have been made to develop water sources. The west dike of Nanyun in Sanguandian, Baoying, has been started to be excavated and has now been completed. This move can draw water from the lake (Gaoyou Lake) to help transport (Gaoyou), unblock the water flow, and benefit the farmland greatly. Other construction taxes are also being carried out one after another.</p>
<p>The public grain warehouse for regulating the people's food and military supplies has recently been formally established, and Xu Yijian has been appointed as the director, responsible for presiding over it.</p>
<p>Public Order and Suppression</p>
<p>In addition to the county security team, the Second Provisional Division of the military is also stationed in Baoying, so the strength to maintain public order in the urban area is quite strong. However, guerrilla forces appear from time to time a few miles outside the city. The city gates are closed at 6:00 PM every day, and the demonstration gunfire of the guerrilla forces can be heard in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>On June 27, the Muyi County security team stationed in Shanyangou had a fierce battle with the Fifth Independent Regiment of the bandit army, and captured many. Afterwards, they were commended by Director Sun of the North Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office. In the middle of the night on July 3, the Honghu water police brigade discovered a team of bandit troops at the port of Hubin, attempting to infiltrate the port. A fierce battle broke out immediately, and Wang Jisheng, the squad leader, led the troops bravely and repelled them.</p>
<p>Rural Conditions</p>
<p>Baoying County is divided into eight districts, with a total population of 428,792, most of whom are farmers. The total area of the county is 212,366.900 acres, and the cultivated area is 108,811.000 acres. The percentage of cultivated land to the total area is 51.2. The main agricultural product is rice, followed by wheat. In addition, Baoying's lotus root flour is well-known (annual output of 500 dan). Because the life is relatively remote and smuggling is inconvenient, prices are lower than in Gaoyou. On July 10, local prices were roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The highest quality rice is 2,780,000 yuan per dan of 150 jin. Pork is 1,800 yuan per jin. Raw oil is 6,400 yuan per jin (old scale). Matches are 550 yuan per box. Guoguang soap is 2,400 yuan per piece. "Changzhou Jiang cloth" is 2,300 yuan per foot, and white foreign cloth is 6,000 yuan per foot.</p>
<p>In order to explore the rural conditions in the local suburban areas, I ventured to Zhangqiao Town, 20 li away from the city in the north, with the locals for an on-site investigation. According to the old farmers, the town's residents are often taken to attend "public rallies", and afterwards, they have to report the situation of the meeting to the garrison, so sometimes they are very busy going back and forth. The model team and militia team of the New Fourth Army, together with the cooperative, purchase agricultural products, all paid in "resistance currency". The ratio with the Central Reserve 券 is one to five hundred. Due to practical needs, the face value of the banknotes is like a postage stamp, temporarily stamped to increase the value of the banknotes, without end, and the farmers feel very painful.</p>
<p>As for donations and taxes, farmers must pay 15 jin of wheat per acre, and rice is 35 jin per acre according to last year's official rate. This year, it has not been determined because it is not the harvest season. "Supply firewood" requires three jin of firewood per acre of land.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Famine</p>
<p>Rice and wheat in Zhangqiao Town are all single-season crops. Previously, only these two crops were known locally. This year, due to the discovery of locusts in early April, both wheat and rice seedlings have been damaged, with losses of more than 50%. According to farmers, the most surprising thing is that the town was supposed to be very cold last winter, and the locusts should have frozen to death. This year's large-scale disaster was really unexpected.</p>
<p>Due to drought and insects, many local farmers have changed their wheat fields to grow soybeans, mung beans, and red beans. These beans must be harvested in August and September of the lunar calendar. As for the wheat harvest in April of this year, it was only half of that of previous years. Barley only harvested 7 or 8 dou per acre, and wheat only 3 or 4 dou per acre. Last year's rice harvest was about one dan per acre, but this year's is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Also, due to climate and location, wheat is generally sown in the ninth month of the lunar calendar. Because it is cold, growth is very slow and it cannot be harvested until May of the following year. Rice is mostly transplanted in May and harvested in mid-August. The price of farmland is about 200,000 yuan per acre near the water, and about 100,000 yuan per acre for the next best.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Transforming Shanghai's Atmosphere</h3>
<p>— Jin Xiongbai</p>
<p>The previous editorial in this newspaper, "Transforming Shanghai's Atmosphere," expressed Mr. Chen Binhe's infinite indignation at the failed fundraising attempts. As someone who followed in the footsteps of those seniors and participated in the events, I share the same feeling. Now is the most important moment to save others and ourselves. I will write another article to elaborate on it.</p>
<p>The general middle and upper classes of Shanghai, especially the so-called gentry and wealthy, have always claimed to be patriotic and loving the people, with upright righteousness. In the moments of discussion, they are often awe-inspiring. Such civil spirit is naturally worthy of admiration. But saving the country with empty talk, there seems to be no such precedent in the world. The more tense the war, the more people take the opportunity to accumulate wealth, and the more severe the rhetoric. Everyone believes that the end of the war is not far away, as long as they have money in hand, they can enjoy happiness in the future. Let others shed blood, and let others bear the burden of the collapse of the sky. As long as they express their opposition to the reality and their disgust for the environment, they will be worthy of being citizens of the Republic of China, and they can safely pass through the chaotic situation. If this phenomenon continues and this atmosphere expands, no matter who wins or loses this war, Shanghai, which has always claimed to lead the talented people of the country, has such desperate facts. The future of China is absolutely pessimistic.</p>
<p>Some people also explain that the previous fundraising events contained some political elements. Donating money is a small matter, and perhaps they will be implicated after "the dawn" arrives. Such foresight aims only at shirking responsibility, and I naturally have nothing to say. If this is the only legitimate reason, it is a bit naive and ridiculous. For example, the first police consumer cooperative fundraising was only to maintain public order, in other words, it was indirectly to protect our own lives and property. The second rescue coupon was for evacuation. The third Jiangsu agricultural loan was to prevent the activities of the bandits on the one hand, and to help Shanghai's food supply on the other hand. The recent air raid relief is even a measure that should be taken by human mutual assistance. What is the connection with the current politics? What is the implication for the future of the funders? Mr. Binhe believes that this shows the fragility of civil power. I believe that this is the decline of civil morality, this is the decline of civil spirit, which is really disappointing.</p>
<p>I would like to contribute some simple ideas that are visible and thinkable to some wealthy and powerful people. The war will naturally end one day, but I ask the Shanghai gentry and wealthy class, who claim to be wise and thoughtful, to open their eyes and look at the environment in Shanghai. The U.S. military's mainland operations, the encirclement of the Communist Party, the indiscriminate bombing of enemy planes, as Mayor Zhou reported at the Municipal Advisory Committee the day before yesterday, "Fate has destined the citizens of Shanghai to experience this tragic life." I ask the people of Shanghai to think about this carefully. The facts will not be so simple as to let you pass the difficulties safely and enjoy happiness forever. In this fate, not to mention whether the property can be preserved, the possibility of saving one's life is still a big problem. Don't wait until the end of your life to regret that you didn't contribute some strength to the society before you died. Don't wait until the last breath to feel that it is too late to donate money and efforts. A common man is not guilty, but he is guilty of possessing jade. In a chaotic era, the rich may not be blessed.</p>
<p>I find this fact ridiculous. For example, the 500 million trillion yuan of the rescue coupon is currently only 50 taels of gold, and it was only more than double that amount at the time. Its value is only worth an ordinary house, and with the power of all the social leaders in Shanghai, it has taken several months, and the total amount is still less than four-fifths, and the actual amount taken out is only one-third of it. I think there are at least 100,000 people in Shanghai who have the power to afford a house worth four to eight gold bars, but they are so indifferent to public welfare matters. Is Shanghai's tragic fate really destined? For example, this time for the donation for air raid relief, in the first few times, when continuous bombing threatened one's own life, or because of a temporary emotional impulse, donations were quite enthusiastic. In the past few days, it seems that things have passed, and at the same time, please check the surnames of the donors. How many of them are the gentry and wealthy in Shanghai? Do all the people in Shanghai have to wait until it is their turn to feel that it is too late to do good?</p>
<p>Given the huge daily business volume of the gold and stock market in Shanghai, as long as one-tenth of the funds can be raised, everything can be done. But how many such people are there in Shanghai?</p>
<p>To save Shanghai, to save yourself, you must rely on your own strength, you must rely on the combined strength of all the citizens of Shanghai. Now is not the time to talk about patriotism and stand by. Disaster is about to befall everyone. To avoid this catastrophe, it depends on how hard we work.</p>
<h3>Meeting Between U.S. President and British King Outside Plymouth Harbor</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to news from Plymouth: U.S. President Truman met with British King George VI yesterday and had lunch together on the British battleship "Renown" anchored outside Plymouth Harbor. To express his welcome to the U.S. President on his first visit to Britain, King George said to Mr. Truman, "Your Excellency's visit to our country is most welcome." Truman also expressed his thanks to the King and shook his hand firmly. President Truman flew to Britain immediately after the Potsdam talks ended, arriving in Plymouth yesterday morning. At the same time, he stepped onto the battleship "Renown" to the sound of military music. King George, dressed in the uniform of Admiral of the Fleet, along with the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax, saluted Truman as he appeared at the top of the ship's ladder. The Royal British Navy band played the American national anthem. Truman held his hat tightly in one hand, with Secretary of State Byrnes and Chief of Naval Operations Leahy standing on either side. As Truman walked to the rear deck of the ship, the King stepped forward to welcome him. Suddenly, a naval officer stepped forward to salute and reported, "The guard of honor is ready for inspection." Truman smiled and replied, "I deeply love inspecting your country's soldiers." After speaking, Truman in front, and the King behind, began the inspection ceremony under the guard of general officers. After completing the inspection, Mr. Truman introduced his entourage to the King one by one and shook hands with Halifax as a courtesy. Afterward, the King and Truman spoke for ten minutes. The King then went with Truman to the bow of the ship for a photograph. When Truman got up to leave the ship, the military music started again, playing the American national anthem. The King and the U.S. President faced each other. Mr. Truman said loudly, "Your Majesty, I will ask your band to teach our band how to play 'Victory at Sea,' the 'Navy Hymn'." Mr. Truman returned to the American cruiser "Augusta." Ten minutes later, the King took a barge to return the visit to President Truman. On a gray-brown American cruiser, Mr. Truman warmly welcomed the King. At that time, the national flags of Britain and America were fluttering on the ship's mast. The ship's band played the "British National Anthem." At the same time, the King inspected the American Navy on the ship. The King stayed on the ship for about thirty minutes and then bid farewell to Mr. Truman and returned to the "Renown." As the "Augusta" sailed back to the United States, the King sent a telegram to the cruiser from the battleship "Renown" to express his final greetings.</p>
<h3>Attlee and Bevin Return to London Together</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to news from London, British Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin both returned to London yesterday after the Potsdam talks ended, making their first visit to Parliament after the Labor Party government was announced.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a Reuters political correspondent, it is widely believed in London that Labor Party member Lawrence (age 73) will hopefully be appointed British Secretary of State for India by Prime Minister Attlee.</p>
<h3>Joint Declaration by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Published in the Capitals of the Three Countries - Only a One-Sided Account of East Asian Issues</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to information obtained here, after the Potsdam talks ended, the capitals of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union issued a joint communiqué yesterday, stating in brief: "The purpose of this meeting is to realize the declaration on Germany issued during the Crimea Conference and to ensure that Germany will never again invade neighboring countries and hinder world peace in the future." The joint communiqué, six thousand words in length, mentioned Germany's compensation issues, administrative issues, and temporary handling of Poland's border issues, etc. Among them, there was a mention of Japan and the Pacific War.</p>
<h3>Council of Foreign Ministers Established in Britain - First Meeting Held Before September 1</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Potsdam Tripartite Conference issued a final joint declaration on the 2nd, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>As a result of the tripartite conference, in order to prepare to conclude peace treaties with the defeated countries and in order to plan for a peaceful settlement with Germany after a German government capable of undertaking the above-mentioned purposes is established, it was decided to organize a Council of Foreign Ministers. The Council will consist of the Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, Chongqing, France, and the United States. The Council will be located in London, and the first meeting is scheduled to be held before September 1. The Council's permanent secretariat will be in London. Its main tasks are to draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, submit them to the United Nations, and be given the power to propose solutions to unresolved issues at the end of the European war. When a government capable of this purpose is established within Germany, the Council should prepare a plan for a peaceful settlement with Germany. Countries other than the above five may also be invited to send representatives to attend, depending on the content of the discussions, especially when discussions on peace with France and Italy begin, representatives from other countries should be invited to participate. Although the conference invited France and Chongqing to participate, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union still reserved the right to "tripartite discussions." Regarding the German question, the following political and economic principles were agreed upon:</p>
<h3>A. Political Principles</h3>
<p>The rights within Germany will be exercised by the supreme commanders of the four countries, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, each in their respective occupation zones, according to the instructions of their respective governments, and may be exercised jointly in the position of members of the Management Council. The treatment of the German people should be unified throughout Germany as much as possible. The purpose of the occupation is to completely disarm Germany, prevent its future military production, and make Germany peacefully cooperate in the future international life. All Nazi activists and party members should be expelled and removed from responsible positions. To achieve the above-mentioned goals, the whole country will be assisted in establishing local autonomy based on democratic principles, especially through universal suffrage. The United Nations will assist in the revival of all democratic systems. A central government will not be established temporarily, but central administrative officials will be set up for finance, transportation, communications, trade, and industry. Freedom of speech, publication, and religion will be allowed, and religious institutions will be respected, and trade unions will be strengthened.</p>
<h3>B. Economic Principles</h3>
<p>In order to eliminate Germany's potential for war, the manufacture of weapons, ammunition, and other military machinery, all aircraft, and ships will be prohibited. Industries directly related to the war economy will be subject to severe control. Unnecessary productivity will be eliminated and destroyed in accordance with the compensation plan. In order to eliminate the excessive concentration of German economic power such as trusts, cartels, and syndicates, the German economy should be decentralized as quickly as possible. The focus of economic revival will be placed on agriculture and the development of peaceful domestic industries. During the occupation period, German territory will be treated as a single economic unit. A joint policy of the United Nations will be established for financial and economic policies. The German people will be recognized with a standard of living that does not exceed the average living standards of European countries, and appropriate measures will be taken immediately to repair transportation agencies, increase coal production, ensure maximum agricultural production, repair people's residences, and manage foreign assets of the German state not seized by the Allied countries. When handling this, resources by which the German people can live should be retained.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Concerned About East Asian Issues</h3>
<p>Zurich, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) Recently, the propaganda organs of the United States have been promoting that the Three-Power Conference will have important announcements in the final communiqué regarding East Asian issues and Pacific issues. According to authoritative neutral parties, East Asian issues and Pacific issues are therefore causing vigilance in British and American public opinion. In particular, there is great concern about how the Stalin-Soong Tzu-wen talks will develop in the future.</p>

<p>Since the conversion of land tax to the collection of goods in kind this year, the results of the collection in various counties and districts have been good. It is said that the Municipal Finance Bureau regards the collection of goods in kind as an innovation and is extremely serious and attentive in its supervision. It pays particular attention to the collection situation of the collection personnel. Recently, someone reported that a certain county collection branch was collecting extra fees. Director Luo was extremely angry and has strictly ordered an investigation and prohibition, and a report is being submitted for verification. If it is true, punishment will be given to rectify officialdom.</p>

<h3>Self-Defense Cadre Training Corps Holds Graduation Ceremony Yesterday - And Holds a Grand Review Ceremony</h3>

The graduation ceremony was held at Zhongfa School at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 3rd).

<h3>A Daring Attempt Actually Succeeded, Strengthening Confidence in Helping Students - Hoping for Quick Donations in the Last Two Days</h3>
<p>There are many things in the world that must be tried before they can succeed. This time, the newspaper's fundraising for student aid, with a target of 300 million yuan, was indeed a "daring attempt," and the result was actually successful. This proves that positive good deeds that serve the public, benefit the nation, and serve the country will definitely be supported by the public and will eventually be completely successful.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Qualification Examination to Be Held Tomorrow Morning and Afternoon</h3>
<p>All New and Old Students Must Participate</p>
<p>The student aid exam of this newspaper is scheduled for tomorrow (the 5th) from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. (Upper and lower grades of senior primary school, upper and lower grades of senior primary school 2, upper and lower grades of junior high school 3, and all grades of senior high school) and from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. (upper and lower grades of junior high school 1, upper and lower grades of junior high school 2, and all grades of vocational school and university). All new and old students must participate, otherwise it will be considered abandonment. The examination hall is located at Datong University, 1370 Xinzha Road. Students must bring their student ID cards and take their seats according to the number assigned to their grade in the previous semester. They must bring their own pencils and erasers. Accompanying parents can rest at Xinzha Road Elementary School and are not allowed to stay inside or outside the examination hall to maintain order.</p>
<p>On July 5, this newspaper started a fundraising campaign, running around and appealing, but the donations were few. Now, with the enthusiastic support from all parties, donations are coming in continuously. The owner of Jingming Hall borrowed money to help students for his birthday, and Mr. Gongbo sold books to help students. Again, Mr. Wang Peng provided huge sums of money to help students. Therefore, this newspaper's target of 300 million yuan is within reach, and our confidence in helping students is even stronger. Not only will thousands of poor students be guaranteed access to higher education, but this newspaper, after marking and reviewing the exams, will be able to relax the standards and allow more young people to avoid elimination and avoid being overlooked. We can report these two points to all enthusiastic people in the community. Now, the predetermined fundraising deadline is only two days away (originally scheduled to end on August 5), and there is still a difference of 100 million yuan from the total amount. We hope that more huge sums of money will be donated in the next two days to reach the full amount as scheduled. That is what the staff of this newspaper blindly and eagerly expect.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Speech</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhou said in his speech: Today is the graduation ceremony of the cadre training organized by the Self-Defense Corps Headquarters. All of you have been able to put aside all your personal affairs with perseverance, braving the heat to come together for rigorous training, and have completed the training period from beginning to end. This is worthy of praise. From today onwards, you are already true cadre talents, and have become the backbone of the 450,000 members of the city's Self-Defense Corps. At the same time, just as you have completed your training from the training corps, the situation is even more tense than before. Therefore, the responsibility you bear is very great, and all the training you have received needs to be put into practice.</p>
<p>Recently, enemy planes have bombed the urban areas of Shanghai, and innocent people have often suffered disasters. You are local self-defense cadres, and you must have a deep sense of vigilance regarding the current state.</p>
<p>Although the self-defense corps in various districts of the city have made the greatest efforts, shed countless blood and sweat, and served the local area during the air raids, and have been very active and hardworking in firefighting, rescue, and other items, there are still many local forces that cannot achieve their ideals, and the effectiveness of various tasks cannot exert a more magnificent force. This is all due to the lack of cadre talents and the inability to command and operate. Now that you have received rigorous training, and have made a lot of progress in spirit and physique, we have very deep and unavoidable expectations for cadre talents in the future, and there is even more possibility of increased bombing, which is nothing more than a means of terror and threat, and it is inevitable that it will affect social order. But our lives and property are entrusted here, and we are confident that the members of the city's self-defense corps will be able to deeply understand the mission of protecting local social order, and with the penetration of the strength of the cadre, we will be able to cope with the enemy's strategies and assist the authorities in ensuring the social order of Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>Therefore, in today's graduation ceremony, I would like to present Zhi, Ren, and Yong (wisdom, benevolence, and courage) to all of you, because Confucius said: "The wise are not confused, the benevolent are not worried, and the brave are not afraid." In this era of war and urgency, we must use great wisdom and great courage to deal with the current difficulties, and even more so use great benevolence to serve the local area and the citizens. This is what I would like to encourage all of you.</p>

<h3>Director Liu Discusses Recent Work Focus of the Economic Bureau: Answers Questions at Press Conference</h3>
<p>The press conference organized by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held at the Municipal Government yesterday morning at 10:30 AM. Director Liu of the Municipal Economic Bureau attended and answered questions from reporters from various newspapers regarding issues such as wartime price control, strengthening various trade associations, household rationing, and registration of major commodities. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Price Issues</h3>
<p>(Question) Could you tell us about the recent key areas of work for the Economic Bureau?</p>
<p>(Answer) The important work of this bureau includes: Industrial and commercial registration, guiding and managing trade associations, registering major commodities, managing prices, supervising agricultural production, and rationing goods.</p>
<p>(Question) It seems very rare for shops to comply with the prices of goods recently approved by the Price Evaluation Committee. For example, it is very difficult to purchase items like leather shoes and toothpaste at the controlled price. What is the bureau's opinion on this?</p>
<p>(Answer) Price evaluation is very difficult. If the prices are set too low, it is difficult to implement; if they are set too high, it goes against the original purpose of evaluation. Furthermore, the factors that influence prices are extremely complex, and it is difficult to achieve practical results without addressing both the symptoms and the root causes. This bureau is paying close attention to this. The reason why the evaluated prices are difficult to implement and why goods cannot be purchased at controlled prices is because prices are changing frequently.</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, general prices have risen sharply again. How does the Economic Bureau intend to deal with this to ensure the livelihood of the people?</p>
<p>(Answer) Although there are various reasons for the soaring prices, the high cost of living and the fact that merchants are not seeking normal profits, leading to hoarding and opportunistic behavior by some, are the biggest factors. This bureau has received an urgent order from the Minister of Industry to quickly develop countermeasures. We are currently seeking instructions from the authorities and coordinating with relevant parties to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Trade Associations</h3>
<p>(Question) To what extent has the strengthening process progressed?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are many types of businesses in this city. In the past, the organization of trade associations was not always sound, and there was often competition among the same industries. Requests to organize associations and disputes arose frequently. We have investigated their nature and types, and made adjustments and guidance, or merged them. Currently, there are 261 units of associations that have been organized, approved, and established, and 11 units that are being reorganized. The methods for strengthening trade associations include: Establishing levels, investigating whether the organization is sound, strictly prohibiting manipulation and control, and selectively reorganizing or merging as a standard for adjustment.</p>
<h3>Household Rationing</h3>
<p>(Question) The household rationing of various goods is intermittent. Does the Economic Bureau have any plans to improve this?</p>
<p>(Answer) The reason why household rationing cannot be done on schedule is due to the lack of material sources. This bureau is constantly negotiating with relevant parties to handle the matter. Recently, we are preparing to implement household grain rationing. The household rationing of flour and daily necessities has not been interrupted. It should be smoother after the new grain harvest.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the current situation of major commodity registration?</p>
<p>(Answer) The registration of major commodities was previously approved by the Ministry of Industry to be carried out within a specified period (April 16 to May 15 of this year). The scope of items includes eight categories: Vitamin, Chemical industry, Hardware, Electrical appliances, Leather raw materials, Newsprint, These eight types of commodities involve three Already registered and are being counted.</p>
<h3>Sympathy for Air Raid Victims: Donations from All Sectors Continue</h3>
<p>A letter from Mr. Xu Shifan, Jiang Yongling, and Yang Houren states: "Our city has been subjected to air raids for days, and countless civilians are displaced and living in dire straits. In the spirit of human mutual aid, how should we express our sympathy and assistance? Therefore, we have launched a campaign to raise air raid relief funds and have collected a total of 10.24 million yuan, which we are sending in full. We hope it will be duly received. Although this small amount may not be of much help, it is merely to fulfill our responsibility."</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. He Zhuoxian states: "Shanghai has been repeatedly subjected to air raids, and although the citizens are in distress, it is heartbreaking to witness. I deeply admire the initiative of your organization to raise relief donations. I am donating 5 million yuan in national currency to express my modest sincerity. Here is a check for 5 million yuan. Please acknowledge receipt."</p>
<p>A letter from all the Chinese and Japanese employees of Shanghai Panasonic Electric Co., Ltd. states: "Our city has recently been subjected to air raids, causing citizens to be displaced. The colleagues of our company cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, all the Chinese and Japanese employees have donated according to their ability, collecting a total of 1,904,000 yuan, which we are sending in full. We hope it will be accepted. We know that a drop in the bucket will not solve the problem, but we hope to inspire others to contribute."</p>
<h3>Commemorating Deceased Father: Donating to Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>A letter from Mr. Dibo, a member of the Allied nations, states: "The second of this month is the seventh anniversary of my father's death in China. According to Japanese customs, a grand memorial service must be held. However, I would like to do something of value to commemorate him. Therefore, I am donating the remaining 200,000 yuan from the donation for airplanes as an air raid relief fund for your country, a small amount to express goodwill."</p>
<h3>City Buddhist Association Assists in Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>In view of the current air raid relief work being coordinated by the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, the City Buddhist Association has specifically notified major temples and monasteries throughout the city to open their doors as much as possible to accommodate disaster-stricken refugees if citizens in the vicinity of the temples and monasteries are subjected to air raids. At the same time, the association is also preparing to organize a Buddhist rescue team to take charge of air raid rescue work.</p>

Any refugees who wish to start a small business but lack funds can apply to the association. Furthermore, it is reported that the association's air raid temporary relief committee is handling the refugee reception work in the Pudong district.
