<h3>日本人力物資依然豐富　美國作戰益感困難　——美國務副卿格魯演詞——</h3>
<p>據紐約來電稱，美國副國務卿格魯本月一日於紐的外國新聞協會席上發表演說，說明對日作戰之困難如次：</p>
<p>三年前自東京歸來後曾努力吿知國民，日本戰力如何强大，日本士兵爲如何可怖之敵。徵諸迄今所有戰役，國民諒已充分認識日本爲何種性質之敵。泰拉瓦作戰，吿知吾儕日軍爲持有異常信條之軍隊。馬尼刺作戰中，美軍亦巳獲得同樣敎訓。而此次硫黃島作戰，症狀軍所以蒙受甚大損失，即爲日軍頑强抗禦之結果。</p>
<p>重要物資在日掌握</p>
<p>日本今已成爲世界强國。日本現扼東亞重要通商綫，該區事實上巳與世界隔離。日本已於世界原料物資最　饒地域確立其地位，而日本所支配之物資，且爲世界經濟絕對不可取缺者。例如日本已支配天然橡膠產額十分之九，當此美國苦於橡膠不足之際，日本則正活用此項寳貴物資。他如日本現所支配之錫，亦達世界總產量百分之七十，椰十乾核則達百分之八十三。由於反軸心軍之推進，日本逐漸難以利用此等資源，固是事實，唯美軍現雖進抵距東京一千二百公里之日本內戶硫黃島，仍未削弱日本戰力。日本依然可能增產飛機·戰車·裝甲車及其他兵器，目前日本仍能生產多於美軍在前綫所能破壞之飛機。美軍縱能封鎖台灣以南，煤·鋁·鐵·食糧等重要物資，日本亦可自給自足。日本早己準備長期戰，貯積巨額飛機用油，今後至少將得再戰二年。加之，美眾補給綫日益延長，而日本則相對縮短，此項事實亦不容忽視。</p>
<p>日本人力亦頗豐富。日本現雖動員×百萬兵力，然而仍有可能立即動員之壯了×百萬，而且十七歲至二十歲之男子，亦可動員××百萬。再則，日本每年可得××萬新壯丁。前綫日軍將士損失，未達此數，乃嚴然之事實。苟不充分認識此等事實，即難眞正把握對日戰性質。</p>
<p>美國船隻苦於不足</p>
<p>太平洋戰中，美國深爲船舶不足所惱。船舶不足固爲開戰以來之事，唯今後亦難解決。反軸心軍作戰中，最大障礙即爲運輸工具不足。太平洋戰爭中，此項不足尤爲顯著，蓋此外尙有時間與距離二要素。對日戰所需船舶，實三倍於對德戰。即在地圖上僅爲一小點之硫黃島上陸戰中，美軍所動員船舶噸數，亦較北法上陸戰　集之噸數爲多。登陸太平羊島與美兵，最初一月間每人須船舶十六噸，以後每月仍須六噸。以具體實例言之，迄至數日爲止，登陸呂宋島美軍兵力，共的十萬，其補給上所需船舶，最初三十日間，計達一百六十萬噸。假定今後不再增加兵力，則以後三十日間，亦需六十萬噸船舶。是以呂宋上陸作戰開始後二個月內，美國必需船舶二百二十萬噸。美國在硫黃島登陸的四萬名陸戰隊，其所需船舶，最初一個月內爲六十四萬頓，其次一個月間廿四萬噸，兩月合計八十八萬噸。僅此二戰，最初六十日內即非動員船舶三百零八萬噸不可，此數的佔反軸心國船舶總量五千萬噸之六％。上述數字，係根據尼米資同令部所推定者，實則由於日本攻擊作戰速度曁困難之增加，所需船舶自必益多。日本不視此次戰事爲十年戰爭，而準備從事百年戰爭。日本最大利點，即爲時間。日本冀於充分時間內利用其支配下之龐大資源。吾儕必須破壞此項計畫，故於太平洋及歐洲兩方面同時採取攻勢。（同盟社里斯本電）（譯自三月五日每日新聞）</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>關於平價米的報告</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>市府採辦的平價米，已經派發兩期。本人曾參與其事，對於辦理經過知之稍詳。外間對於此事容有批評，爰作報吿，藉明梗槪。</p>
<p>這次平價米的主要意義，在於（一）補充一般配給與重點配給之不足，（二）籍以抑制黑米價之上漲。辦理成功，深得周市長羅秘書長的主持之力，以及江蘇省府當局，盟邦蘇州軍部與現地軍部，曁米統會方面的協力，這應首先感謝的。本市諮詢委員會在第十二次大會中爲辦理此事設立「臨時購米委員會」。並於二月二十一日，爲辦理收米發米集款等等實際工作，設立「平價米委員會」負責推動，該委員會由市府及公益慈善界，敎育界，新聞文化界，工廠界，商業界，銀錢業界等六單位各推代表一人組織之。</p>
<p>接洽平價米時，先行商定幾個原則，（一）派售平價米的對象限於各業職工及低薪水階級。（二）的定全付現鈔，因米統會須以現鈔收米。（三）約定米款由各領米戶之職工付出，不能由政府機關或銀行墊款。關於（二）（三）兩點的的定，當時是含有意義的，外間不明眞相而對此懷疑批評者，乘此說明。</p>
<p>第一期交款日期，的定在去年舊歷年底，現鈔交淸。希望在年底有一批米到後，供給需要，以期黑市米便不致抬高。可是，一般人允其是工商界對此並不感覺興趣，因爲當時黑市米價與平價米價相差不多，僅及八折，而且存有怕麻煩的心理。所以，交款延期，未能履行的定日期。這是我們方面違背了獎的的義務，幾乎影響到第二期平價米的廢的，這正給予我們極大的敎訓。我們一定要做到迅速與守的，絕對不能持觀望態度。這般觀望者的目光，只看見平價米價與黑市米價相差僅及八折，只看到小的一面。而未注意到這批平價米無論如何可使黑市米價減輕上漲程度，可以安定人心，未看到大的一面。到了第二期，因爲受了第一期延遲違約不能取信的影饗，的定的交款日期極爲短促，而居然能如期交款，總算不幸中之幸。</p>
<p>至於分派數量方面，規定各界各得若干單位，依照各界的人數範圍大致決定，當然未盡理想。可是，當時的原意，對於低薪水階級受到實惠，即算目的已達，自然不可能如戶口米的平均。譬如新聞文化界總共的五十單位（在各界是最少數），其中分新聞從業員十單位，雜誌期刊一單位，小型報職工一單位，醫業十單位，報販十單位，作家一單位，印刷業職工十單位，話劇從業員四單位，電影從業員三單位。報販人數比較新聞從業員人數少，而新聞從業員薪給此較報販高，爲適合低級職工受到實惠的原則，所以規定新聞從業員與報阪同樣十單位，這是一例。</p>
<p>因此，爲適合這一原則，希望各界注意者，任何領米戶，應由低級職工享受購買權利，決不能由公司工廠或任何機構（公益慈善團體例外）本身購買。假定公司或工廠派到十石米，即由該公司工廠本身購買了給予職工膳食，還是不合理的。其决，必須以所派之米，全數轉派職工，不能提留一部分而減少每人應得的權利。傳聞少數領米戶派到米後，幷未派給低級職工，我們認爲這是極不合理，應立即補救，才合平價米的原意，否則應予撿舉，受法律制裁。</p>
<p>在已領到的兩期米過程中，有兩點可吿慰者，第一，米量的足數，或許稍有缺少者，也不過是被路上小竊臨時偷竊。第二，一般米質很好，間有糙米則爲數極少。實際上在目前環境中，有米即好，談不到粗糙與否。這是米統會的協力應向致謝的。</p>
<p>最後，有人提出，有了平價米以後，黑市米幷未跌價反而上漲。我們認爲黑市米價的抑低，有了平價米不過是條件之一。而最基本的條件，還在於（一）一般配給米必須準期準量。（二）米的來源必須不絕疏通。如果這兩點沒有做到，只有平價米一個條件，自然無法做到全面抑低的。可是，進一步講，假定沒有平價米，也許黑市米價更高。因此，軍部的協力以及辦理平價米者的努力，可以說並非徒勞了。</p>

<p>南京二十五日中央社電中央黨部組織部副部長巫蘭溪氏，昨日會見記者發表談話如决：自去年以來，中央及地方黨部皆認爲強化國民黨工作至爲迫切。各方對此意見，的可歸納三端：第一加强集權，第二調整人事，第三變更機構。此三種意見　經討論結束，始決定恢復事變以前制度，陳代主蒿根據此點衙加攷應後，乃決定恢復選舉制。恢復選舉有三點意義：即（一）爲清理黨籍，辦於是選　舉，必須選行調查黨員人數，由此可明白黨員分段確實情部。（二）整理組織系統，因選舉時必須經過合法手續，這種手續的經過，也就是黨部組織的階層，其次乃能進一步整理黨部組織系統，乃可以產生優秀黨員，至黨部工作人員以本籍人士爲原則。此次選舉之單位，計華中方面爲蘇浙皖淮海南京上海並包括贛鄂及蘇北黨務指導會漢口特別市黨部等，華中各單位定於五月十五日以前選舉完成，江西湖北漢口須待選舉文　抵達後二月間完成。華南方面有一健全之廣東省黨部，然因交通開係，須視情形而定。華北方面計有河北河南山東陝西天津北平等，因情形特殊，中央方面將視形情另案辦理。關於選舉要綱業由中央頒布，現各級黨部正注意辦理此項手續。本來在訓政時期，國民黨之工作爲代表民衆者，至實施憲政時期，即將政權交還民衆，於此非常時期，急須有一强有力而能領導民衆的機稱，此在黨一方面也等於多一個帮助。故以國民黨立塲言之，對此次在京召開之各省市戰時民衆代表會譏期待甚殷，今後國民黨當於本位立塲，努力强化工作，俾得進一步負起領導之重責。</p>

<h3>救濟庫券中五千萬元　分由個人認購　李思浩等邀請各界商談辦法</h3>
<p>最近市府發行之救濟庫券十五億元，十億元由市府商請中儲行總銷，五億元由民問認購，其中四億五千萬元，由各業公會分等認購，五千萬元由各界人士認購，推睛李思浩。金雄白。陳彬龢等負責邀請各界人士，商討分認辦法。當於二十四日下午四時在市府禮堂舉行茶會，邀請下列人員出席商談。</p>
<p>邀請各單　尤菊生·盛幼貪·章榮初·邵式軍·吳同文·竹淼生·周吉甫·周文端·董和甫·詹沛霖·徐大統·沈錦洲·鮑國昌·江上達·　星五·戴耕莘·了厚卿·唐星海·程年彭·王厚甫·沈佳士·羅洪義·藍芭蓀·吳國璋·陸秉甫·嚴慶祥·呈庸庵·徐　棠·史致富·徐翔蓀·張蘭坪·吳志衛·吳瑞元·邊瑞　·林朝聘·胡桂庚·饒韜叔·郭琳爽·邵長春·虛順恩·朱順林·蔡聲白·陳伯藩·貝潤生·潘志　·徐補孫·趙伸英·周宗良·譚敬·黃振東·張瑞棠·徐文照·樂汝成·徐長春·</p>
<p>出席人員　準時出席，或事前面治，或函復接治者，計有療幼　·詹沛霖·沈錦洲·鮑國昌·了厚卿·程年彭·羅洪義·張瑞棠·徐長春·龔星五·朱順林·吳庸庵·徐懋棠·吳志衛·吳瑞元·郭琳爽·徐補蓀·周宗良·黃振東等</p>
<p>開會經過　首由李思浩說明召集茶會意義，並希望各界人士踴躍認購。繼由金雄白報吿庫券用途，十億元爲雜補過去戶口米之差額，二億元爲防空救濟經費，二億元爲疏散人口經費，一億元爲治安特別經費。並說明本案係陳前市長任」內即已決定，現在以九六實收，幷扣除千分之十五手續費，本月底如數繳解復興銀行代收，事關社會公益，希望踴躍認購。末爲陳彬龢發言，略謂：周市長在告市民書中提到「公益重於私利，社會先於個人一兩句話，一般市民對此固須重視，尤以社會領導階層，更須特別體騐。上海有許多富於經濟實力，或暴利者，平常對於國家事業社會公益，漠不關心。在過去租界時代，外人庇護之下，固可倖僥；但現在時代環境絕然不同，尤其在非常時期，家社會的責任，希望這般人轉變心理，重視國家社會公益事業。此次市府發行求濟庫券，完全爲市民公益所需，希望踴躍認購，如仍保持過去漠視公益的態度，必將遭受社會輿論一致制裁，爲衆共　。例如今天邀請各位中，有許多人旣不出席，又不委派代表，亦不書面置復，即在個人禮貌上已屬不應如此，何况對於社會公益，更不應有此稱態度，深爲遺憾。但我們仍本忠吿立塲，希望從此覺悟。</p>
<p>認購情形　繼由出席人員討論認購辦法，決定邀請名單中每人至少認購自五十萬元至二百萬元，另行通函知照。如在上開名單以外，有經濟實力足堪擔任者，希望各界通函提名，以期社會公益事業由社會有力份子平均擔任。當塲首由金雄白代表盛幼食認購二百萬元，鮑國昌認購一百萬元，吳瑞元·丁厚卿各認購五十萬元，羅洪義。張瑞棠·徐長春代表總記認購一千萬元，李思浩代表吳庸庵認購一百萬元。</p>
<h3>各業認購救濟庫券應履行規定點</h3>
<p>關於市政諮詢委員會建議發行三十四年臨時救院核准發行一事。據市商會負責人云：日昨各報雖有發表，然其中多語未詳盡，深恐各業公會未能透切瞭解。故本會除會問經濟局分別規定各公會認購等級及數量，應即轉飭各業遵辦外，並希各業應履行以下三點：</p>
<p>（甲）交款日期限本月底截止。</p>
<p>（乙）在本月底前繳款者，除按九六交款外，得給手續費千分之十五，即照應募數目，每千元給予手續費十五元，以示優異。該項手續費，於募款交足時扣給。</p>
<p>（丙）交款地點爲本市復興銀行。</p>
<h3>錢業規定撥款單　掛失辦法</h3>
<p>本市錢莊業同業公會，鑒於與錢莊本票同樣鄭重之撥款單，往往有托名遺失，聲請止付，致影響票據之流通情事。爲絕滅積弊，防杜將來起見，爰於業規第四十六條，添列一項，規定撥款單之掛失止付辦法，比照本票辦理，須由出票莊將款送交公會保管，務重信譽，而種輕易佳失之弊。自此事議辦以來，頗有多莊遵照實施，絕不輕徇客戶之請求，予以通融。此種舉動，該會方面，深表同意，並希同業全體會員莊，悉能遵照辦理，則今後錢莊業間票據信用，將與日俱增</p>

<p>又於該案發生後，至出事地點爭相詢問者甚衆，於前日有歹徒張天保者，竟冒充公務員至該處向房東王變陽有所糾纏，企圖威嚇索詐，被探員識破僞充情事，常將張帶局訉辦。據悉：張天保犯同樣冒充公務人員威逼索詐案多起，正在偵審中。</p>

<h3>義務小學積極凖備　預定四月一日開學　盼保甲方面轉吿失學兒童報名</h3>
<p>義務小學進行籌備，賴各方面熱忱協助，頗爲順利，現商借佼舍，選聘敎師兩事，已經決定，學生用的課本，也承各界捐贈，並繼續向各方面徵集。至於經費方面，開辦費用，承義賣市塲捐助一百萬元，可無問題。經常費用，雖承讀者紛紛贊助「義學金」，但就一週間的成績以觀，捐款最踴躍者，僅限於各校學生範圍，且大都爲小學生與苦學生，這現象一方面表示了最純潔的同情心，一方面則可證明尙未引起各界普遍的響應。我們誠懇的籲請讀者諸君，尤其是熟心敎育的有力諸君，起來贊助。現在我們準備四月一日開學，明後天就須開始招生。我們辦義務敎育，當然希望把義敎的機會給予每個失學兒童。目前雖因種種環境關係，只能先辦十所，但是我們考慮到失學兒童的家畏也許看不到報紙，不知道有義校的事，所以，爲使失學兒童不錯過機會，我們請求保甲方面的協助，譬如在義校附近的住戶，如有失學兒童，精保甲方面轉吿，並指示來校報名，一方面由申報義務敎育委員會名義備函總聯保長請予協助。</p>

<h3>米在真如</h3>
<p>— 熙家</p>
<p>如位於上海市區的西北角，西接嘉定，北通賽山，是京滬路自上海出發之第一站，水路有桃樹浦南北縱貫，民船可通長江及蘇州河，公路亦四通八達，可至附近各地。戰前國立曁南大學即設於車站之對面，建築極爲宏偉，正風文學院及交通部國際大電台也都在此，且要人別　洋房林立，故頗爲人們所注意。</p>
<p>米的行列</p>
<p>從曹家渡橋向西北展開了一條寬闊而平坦的公路，它直伸延下去穿過眞如可達南翔。南翔是一個大的米糧集散地，在那兒有一百多家米行，上海人到那兒阪米的每天總有五六百人，這其中幾乎全是男子。這些男子只有少數是步行肩槓的，有十分之八都是踏脚踏車的。據一位眞如鎭上的人精確估計，最多的時候要有五百部脚踏車經過這裏，這條公路上來去脚踏接車接連不斷，有工人型的，有商人型的，有學生型的，其中也點輟着綠衣的郵差。往北去的是輕快地疾馳着，南來車後都重重的掛着兩大麻袋，那上面還壓着一洋麵袋，有的甚前面車　上又担了一洋麵袋，他們最高的記錄是三石，米就這樣的流向上海的每一條里弄。</p>
<p>生活種種</p>
<p>眞如主要的出產是菜蔬，在眞如鎭上每家雜糧行里都出賣菜籽。莧菜籽·韭菜籽·油菜籽·蒿苞籽·葱籽，應有盡有。在逍里更有上海市中央市塲眞如分塲，每天下午二時開市，它的價格是與總塲不同的。這些日子因爲天暖雨量很多，菜生長極快。來價不得不大跌特跌，白菜只賣到二百二十，菠菜更落至一百三十。曹家渡菜市和上海西北角的居民菜蔬多數却是由這兒供給的，它輸出量的豐富，是可推想而知的了。</p>
<p>假如有一是臨時米市塲，一眼望去足足有一百多個攤頭，那萬頭攢動的情形眞令人吃驚！上海米販貧路近的多數到這里來買，眞如的米販從南翔阪來的，也多數在這里脫手。本來眞如鎭上是有六七家大米行的，但是麻煩太多，他們就把店關了改擺米攤，這樣的確少了許多嚕囌，也省了不少開銷。</p>
<p>眞如車站西北二里許有楊家橋，這兒是過往上海和南翔必經的要道，成爲米阪打尖的好去處，小飯店·麵店·搶餅攤·　頭店，一家接一家，都是川流不息，坐位常滿。有幾家賣山東饅頭的更是生意興隆，雖然每個賣到二百槐，但仍是一籠一籠的被一搶而空。計算起來，這種吃食店應要佔全鎭店舖的十分之八，足足有四十多家！</p>
<p>在楊家橋有一所小型的麵粉廠「申豐」，創辦了快二年，日夜開工可出產三百多袋，不過由於電力限制，所以只好做一天停兩天，這探自然有供不應求之勢，市區的大餅攤。搶餅。麵店等很多派大師傳到麵賤的情形這兒一袋兩袋的來買，現在因爲麥貴，和蘇州無錫的麵粉到滬較多，生意也不大好了。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues East of Manila</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese forces east of Manila continue to fight. The fighting there is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy's 13th Division attempted to break through the Japanese lines but suffered heavy losses due to fierce resistance from the Japanese forces. In the month from February 21st to March 20th, excluding the damage since March 8th, the enemy suffered approximately 9,000 casualties, including two division commanders, and their morale is low. The commander of the enemy's 6th Division was seriously wounded by a Japanese commando raid near Montalban. Also, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Regiment was seriously wounded by a Japanese Miyazaki unit raid west of Antipolo. In addition, in the past month on the Manila eastern front, in addition to killing many enemy soldiers, the Japanese forces have achieved the following other results: destroying 54 artillery pieces, 7 tanks, 10 armored vehicles, 27 tractors, 12 machine guns, and other weapons, ammunition, and supplies; and capturing 8 machine guns, many rifles, and other items.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Complete Defensive Position Transfer in Lingayen Gulf</h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese forces in the Lingayen Gulf area have subsequently transferred their forces to new defensive positions in the eastern mountains according to plan. Therefore, the Japanese forces have completed the transfer without suffering any damage. Afterwards, the enemy actively constructed rear roads, and with a portion of their forces, centered on Baguio, they invaded the west, south, and southeast to a range of 20 to 25 kilometers, with the intention of invading the interior of the mountains. They are conducting reconnaissance on the Japanese forward positions or guard posts. Enemy forces in the San Fabian area are constructing artillery positions and shelling the vicinity of Baguio City with maximum range. On the Baguio mountain road, enemy forces are advancing towards Baguio from Rosario, and small units of both armies are engaged in fierce combat. The sound of gunfire shakes the mountains. Japanese troops are conducting night raids everywhere, thus opening the prelude to mountain warfare in the northern Luzon highlands, known as the "Roof of the Philippines". In response to this, enemy bombing of Baguio is also gradually intensifying. The beautiful city, formerly known as the Summer Capital, has been largely reduced to ruins by indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft.</p>

(2) Japanese air forces attacked enemy air bases at San Fabian and Lingayen in Luzon on March 22nd, as well as transport ship groups that were anchored, causing large explosions and fires in twenty places on the ground. The area around the airfield turned into a sea of fire. In addition, two transport ships exploded and caught fire.</p>
<h3>Enemy US Aircraft Intruded into the Skies of the Capital City Twice Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - From 1:00 PM to approximately 2:40 PM on the 25th, fifteen US Air Force P-51 aircraft from Chongqing intruded into the skies of the capital city twice, strafing the vicinity of the airfield with machine guns in formations of two to four aircraft. The Japanese air defense forces immediately engaged them. One enemy aircraft was shot down and three were damaged. One of them was hit by ground fire. Our side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Japan's Manpower and Material Resources Remain Abundant; US Operations Increasingly Difficult - Speech by US Undersecretary of State Grew</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from New York, US Undersecretary of State Grew delivered a speech on the 1st of this month to the Foreign News Association in New York, explaining the difficulties of the war against Japan as follows:</p>
<p>Three years ago, after returning from Tokyo, I tried to inform the nation how strong Japan's war power was and how formidable the Japanese soldiers were as enemies. Judging from all the battles fought so far, the nation should have fully recognized what kind of enemy Japan is. The Battle of Tarawa informed us that the Japanese army is an army with unusual beliefs. In the Battle of Manila, the US military has also learned the same lesson. And in the Battle of Iwo Jima this time, the reason why the US military suffered such great losses was the result of the Japanese army's tenacious resistance.</p>
<p>Important Materials in Japanese Hands</p>
<p>Japan has now become a world power. Japan now controls important trade routes in East Asia, and the region is virtually isolated from the world. Japan has established its position in the region with the most abundant raw materials in the world, and the materials controlled by Japan are absolutely indispensable to the world economy. For example, Japan has controlled nine-tenths of the natural rubber production. At a time when the United States is suffering from a shortage of rubber, Japan is making good use of this valuable material. Other materials such as tin, which Japan now controls, account for 70% of the world's total production, and copra accounts for 83%. Due to the advance of the anti-Axis forces, it is true that it is becoming increasingly difficult for Japan to utilize these resources. However, even though the US military has now advanced to Iwo Jima, 1,200 kilometers from Tokyo, it has not weakened Japan's war power. Japan is still capable of increasing the production of aircraft, tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons. Japan is currently able to produce more aircraft than the US military can destroy on the front lines. Even if the US military can block south of Taiwan, Japan can still be self-sufficient in important materials such as coal, aluminum, iron, and food. Japan has long prepared for a long-term war and has stored huge amounts of aviation fuel. It will be able to fight for at least two more years. In addition, the fact that the US supply lines are becoming longer and longer, while Japan's are relatively shorter, should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Japan's manpower is also quite abundant. Although Japan has now mobilized × million troops, it is still possible to immediately mobilize another × million strong men, and ×× million men aged seventeen to twenty can also be mobilized. Furthermore, Japan can obtain ××0,000 new recruits every year. The number of Japanese soldiers lost on the front lines has not reached this number, which is a clear fact. It is difficult to truly grasp the nature of the war against Japan without fully recognizing these facts.</p>
<p>US Ships Suffering from Shortage</p>
<p>In the Pacific War, the United States is deeply troubled by a shortage of ships. The shortage of ships has been a problem since the beginning of the war, but it is difficult to solve in the future. The biggest obstacle in the anti-Axis war is the lack of transportation. This shortage is particularly pronounced in the Pacific War, because there are also the two factors of time and distance. The number of ships required for the war against Japan is actually three times that of the war against Germany. Even in the battle on Iwo Jima, which is only a small dot on the map, the tonnage of ships mobilized by the US military was greater than the tonnage gathered in the North French landing operation. Landing on a Pacific island requires 16 tons of ships per American soldier in the first month, and 6 tons per month thereafter. To give a concrete example, the US forces that landed on Luzon up to a few days ago totaled 100,000, and the ships required for their supplies reached 1.6 million tons in the first 30 days. Assuming that the number of troops will not increase in the future, 600,000 tons of ships will still be needed in the next 30 days. Therefore, within two months after the start of the Luzon landing operation, the United States must have 2.2 million tons of ships. The 40,000 Marines who landed on Iwo Jima required 640,000 tons of ships in the first month and 240,000 tons in the second month, totaling 880,000 tons in two months. These two battles alone require the mobilization of 3.08 million tons of ships in the first 60 days, which accounts for 6% of the total of 50 million tons of anti-Axis ships. The above figures are based on estimates by Nimitz's command, but in reality, due to the increased speed and difficulty of Japanese attacks, the number of ships required will inevitably be even greater. Japan does not regard this war as a ten-year war, but is prepared to engage in a hundred-year war. Japan's greatest advantage is time. Japan hopes to use its vast resources under its control within a sufficient amount of time. We must destroy this plan, so we are taking the offensive simultaneously in the Pacific and Europe.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Report on Affordable Rice</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>The affordable rice purchased by the city government has been distributed in two phases. I have participated in this matter, and I know the details of the handling process in detail. There may be criticisms from the outside world about this matter, so I am making a report to clarify the general situation.</p>
<p>The main significance of this affordable rice lies in (1) supplementing the deficiencies of general rationing and key rationing, and (2) curbing the rise in black market rice prices. The success of the handling is deeply attributed to the leadership of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, as well as the cooperation of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Allied Suzhou Military Headquarters, the local military headquarters, and the Rice Control Association. These should be thanked first. The Municipal Advisory Committee established a "Temporary Rice Purchase Committee" in the twelfth congress to handle this matter. On February 21st, a "Affordable Rice Committee" was established to handle the actual work of collecting rice, distributing rice, collecting funds, etc., and was responsible for promotion. The committee was organized by representatives from six units, including the municipal government, public welfare and charity circles, education circles, news and culture circles, factory circles, business circles, and banking circles.</p>
<p>When contacting affordable rice, several principles were agreed upon in advance: (1) The target of selling affordable rice is limited to workers in various industries and low-paid classes. (2) Full cash payment is required, because the Rice Control Association must collect rice with cash. (3) It is agreed that the rice payment will be paid by the employees of each rice-receiving household, and no government agency or bank can advance the payment. The determination of points (2) and (3) at that time was meaningful. Outsiders who do not know the truth and have doubts and criticisms about this should explain it here.</p>
<p>The payment date for the first phase was set at the end of the last lunar year, and the cash payment was cleared. It was hoped that after a batch of rice arrived at the end of the year, it would be supplied to those in need, so that the black market rice would not be raised. However, in general, the industrial and commercial sectors did not feel interested in this, because the black market rice price at that time was not much different from the affordable rice price, only 20% off, and there was also a fear of trouble. Therefore, the payment was postponed and the scheduled date could not be fulfilled. This is a violation of the promised obligations on our part, which almost affected the abolition of the second phase of affordable rice. This gave us a great lesson. We must be swift and punctual, and we must never take a wait-and-see attitude. The eyes of these onlookers only see that the difference between the affordable rice price and the black market rice price is only 20% off, and only see the small side. They did not notice that this batch of affordable rice can reduce the extent of the black market rice price increase no matter what, and can stabilize people's hearts. They did not see the big side. By the second phase, because of the delay and breach of contract in the first phase, which could not be trusted, the payment date was extremely short, and it was fortunate that the payment could be made on schedule.</p>
<p>As for the distribution quantity, it is stipulated that each sector will get a certain number of units, which is roughly determined according to the number of people in each sector. Of course, it is not ideal. However, the original intention at that time was that the low-paid classes would receive practical benefits, which would be considered as the goal achieved. Naturally, it is impossible to be as average as household rice. For example, the news and culture sector has a total of 50 units (the smallest number in each sector), of which 10 units are allocated to news practitioners, 1 unit to magazines and periodicals, 1 unit to employees of small newspapers, 10 units to the medical profession, 10 units to newspaper vendors, 1 unit to writers, 10 units to printing workers, 4 units to drama practitioners, and 3 units to film practitioners. The number of newspaper vendors is less than the number of news practitioners, and the salaries of news practitioners are higher than those of newspaper vendors. In order to suit the principle that low-level employees receive practical benefits, it is stipulated that news practitioners and newspaper vendors have the same 10 units. This is an example.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to suit this principle, it is hoped that all sectors will pay attention that any rice-receiving household should allow low-level employees to enjoy the right to purchase, and must not be purchased by the company, factory or any organization (except for public welfare and charitable organizations) itself. Assuming that the company or factory is assigned 10 shi of rice, that is, the company or factory itself buys it and gives it to the employees for meals, it is still unreasonable. The decision must be that all the rice assigned is transferred to the employees, and no part of it can be retained to reduce the rights of each person. It is rumored that a small number of rice-receiving households did not distribute the rice to low-level employees after it was assigned. We believe that this is extremely unreasonable and should be remedied immediately to conform to the original intention of affordable rice. Otherwise, it should be reported and sanctioned by law.</p>
<p>In the process of the two phases of rice that have been received, there are two points that can be gratifying. First, the amount of rice is sufficient, and perhaps there is a slight shortage, but it is only temporarily stolen on the road. Second, the general quality of the rice is very good, and the number of brown rice is very small. In fact, in the current environment, it is good to have rice, and it is not possible to talk about whether it is coarse or not. The cooperation of the Rice Control Association should be thanked.</p>
<p>Finally, some people have raised that after affordable rice was available, the black market rice price did not fall but rose instead. We believe that the reduction of the black market rice price is only one of the conditions with affordable rice. The most basic conditions are (1) the general rationed rice must be on time and in quantity. (2) The source of rice must be unblocked. If these two points are not achieved, there is only one condition of affordable rice, and naturally it is impossible to achieve a comprehensive reduction. However, further speaking, if there is no affordable rice, perhaps the black market rice price will be higher. Therefore, the cooperation of the military headquarters and the efforts of those who handle affordable rice can be said to be not in vain.</p>

<h3>The Election System Restored in Party Branches at All Levels to Strengthen Party Affairs and Lead the People</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Wu Lanxi, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Party Headquarters, met with reporters yesterday and made the following remarks: Since last year, the central and local party branches have recognized the urgent need to strengthen the Kuomintang's work. Opinions from all parties on this matter can be summarized into three points: first, to strengthen centralization; second, to adjust personnel; and third, to change the organization. After discussion, it was decided to restore the system prior to the incident. Chen Daizhu proposed additional considerations based on this point, and it was then decided to restore the election system. The restoration of elections has three meanings: (1) To clean up party membership. Elections require investigating the number of party members, which will clarify the actual situation of party member segments. (2) To reorganize the organizational system. Elections must go through legal procedures, which represent the hierarchical structure of the party branch organization. This will further reorganize the party branch organization and produce outstanding party members. As a principle, party branch staff should be local people. The electoral units this time include the Central China region: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Huaihai, Nanjing, Shanghai, as well as the Jiangxi, Hubei, and Northern Jiangsu Party Affairs Guidance Committees, and the Hankou Special Municipal Party Branch. The election in each unit of Central China is scheduled to be completed before May 15. Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hankou will complete the election two months after the election documents arrive. In South China, there is a sound Guangdong Provincial Party Branch, but it will depend on the circumstances due to transportation. In North China, there are Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Tianjin, and Beiping. Due to the special circumstances, the central government will handle them separately depending on the situation. The central government has already issued the outline of the election, and party branches at all levels are paying attention to handling these procedures. Originally, during the period of political tutelage, the Kuomintang's work was to represent the people. When the period of constitutional government is implemented, political power will be returned to the people. In this extraordinary period, there is an urgent need for a strong and capable organization to lead the people. From the party's perspective, this is equivalent to having more help. Therefore, from the Kuomintang's standpoint, it has high expectations for the wartime people's representative conferences of various provinces and cities being held in Nanjing. In the future, the Kuomintang will work hard to strengthen its work from its own position so as to further assume the heavy responsibility of leadership.</p>

<h3>50 Million Yuan in Relief Bonds Underwritten by Individuals; Li Sihao and Others Invite People from All Walks of Life to Discuss Methods</h3>
<p>Of the 1.5 billion yuan in relief bonds recently issued by the municipal government, 1 billion yuan was entrusted to the Central Reserve Bank for overall underwriting, and 500 million yuan was underwritten by the public. Of this, 450 million yuan was underwritten by various industry associations according to their levels, and 50 million yuan was underwritten by people from all walks of life. Li Sihao, Jin Xiongbo, Chen Binhe, and others were responsible for inviting people from all walks of life to discuss underwriting methods. A tea party was held at 4:00 PM on the 24th in the municipal government auditorium, inviting the following personnel to attend and discuss.</p>
<p>Invited Units: You Jusheng, Sheng Youcai, Zhang Rongchu, Shao Shijun, Wu Tongwen, Zhu Miaosheng, Zhou Jifu, Zhou Wenduan, Dong Hefu, Zhan Peilin, Xu Datong, Shen Jinzhou, Bao Guochang, Jiang Shangda, Gong Xingwu, Dai Gengxin, Liao Houqing, Tang Xinghai, Cheng Nianpeng, Wang Houfu, Shen Jiashi, Luo Hongyi, Lan Bason, Wu Guozhang, Lu Bingfu, Yan Qingxiang, Cheng Yong'an, Xu Mao, Shi Zhifu, Xu Xiangsun, Zhang Lanping, Wu Zhiwei, Wu Ruiyuan, Bian Ruifeng, Lin Zhaopin, Hu Guigeng, Rao Taoshu, Guo Linshuang, Shao Changchun, Xu Shun'en, Zhu Shunlin, Cai Shengbai, Chen Bofan, Bei Runsheng, Pan Zhiquan, Xu Busun, Zhao Shenying, Zhou Zongliang, Tan Jing, Huang Zhendong, Zhang Ruitang, Xu Wenzhao, Le Rucheng, Xu Changchun.</p>
<p>Attendees: Those who attended on time, notified in advance, or replied by letter included: Liao Youyi, Zhan Peilin, Shen Jinzhou, Bao Guochang, Liao Houqing, Cheng Nianpeng, Luo Hongyi, Zhang Ruitang, Xu Changchun, Gong Xingwu, Zhu Shunlin, Wu Yong'an, Xu Maotang, Wu Zhiwei, Wu Ruiyuan, Guo Linshuang, Xu Busun, Zhou Zongliang, Huang Zhendong, etc.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings: Li Sihao first explained the meaning of convening the tea party and expressed the hope that people from all walks of life would actively underwrite. Jin Xiongbo then reported on the use of the bonds: 1 billion yuan to make up for the deficit of past household rice, 200 million yuan for air defense and relief funds, 200 million yuan for population dispersal funds, and 100 million yuan for special security funds. He also explained that this proposal was decided during the tenure of former Mayor Chen, and now it is received at 96%, with a 1.5% handling fee deducted. The funds will be submitted to the Fuxing Bank for collection by the end of the month. This matter concerns social welfare, and it is hoped that everyone will actively underwrite. Chen Binhe then spoke, stating: Mayor Zhou mentioned "public interest is more important than private interest, society comes before the individual" in his letter to the citizens. The general public should pay attention to this, especially the social leadership, who should especially experience it. Shanghai has many people with economic strength or windfall profits who are usually indifferent to national and social welfare undertakings. In the past, under the protection of foreigners in the concession era, they could escape punishment. But now the times and environment are completely different, especially in this extraordinary period. We hope that these people will change their mentality, pay attention to national and social welfare undertakings, and assume their family and social responsibilities. This time, the municipal government issued relief bonds entirely for the benefit of the citizens, and it is hoped that everyone will actively underwrite. If they still maintain the past attitude of ignoring public welfare, they will inevitably be subject to unanimous social criticism and public condemnation. For example, many of those invited today neither attended, nor delegated representatives, nor replied in writing, which is already inappropriate in terms of personal etiquette, let alone for social welfare. We deeply regret this attitude. But we still stand on a loyal advisory position, hoping that they will wake up from now on.</p>
<p>Underwriting Situation: The attendees then discussed the underwriting methods and decided to notify each person on the invitation list to underwrite at least 500,000 to 2 million yuan. If there are people with economic strength outside the list who are capable of undertaking this, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will nominate them so that social welfare undertakings can be undertaken equally by the powerful members of society. Jin Xiongbo first represented Sheng Youcai to underwrite 2 million yuan, Bao Guochang underwrote 1 million yuan, Wu Ruiyuan and Ding Houqing each underwrote 500,000 yuan, and Luo Hongyi, Zhang Ruitang, and Xu Changchun represented a total of 10 million yuan. Li Sihao represented Wu Yong'an to underwrite 1 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Fulfillment Points for Various Industries' Subscription to Relief Bonds</h3>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Advisory Committee's suggestion to issue temporary relief bonds for the 34th year of the Republic, which was approved, a person in charge of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce said: Although there were announcements in the newspapers yesterday, many details were not detailed enough, and it is feared that various industry associations may not fully understand. Therefore, in addition to the fact that this association will consult with the Economic Bureau to separately stipulate the subscription levels and quantities for each association, and should immediately instruct each industry to comply, it is also hoped that each industry should fulfill the following three points:</p>
<p>(A) The deadline for payment is the end of this month.</p>
<p>(B) Those who pay before the end of this month will be given a handling fee of 1.5% in addition to paying at 96%, that is, a handling fee of 15 yuan will be given for every 1,000 yuan of the solicited amount to show excellence. The handling fee will be deducted when the fundraising is fully paid.</p>
<p>(C) The payment location is the Fuxing Bank in this city.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Loss Reporting Methods for Money Shop Remittance Orders</h3>
<p>The Money Shop Association of this city, in view of the fact that remittance orders, which are as solemn as money shop bank notes, are often reported lost under false pretenses, requesting payment to be stopped, thereby affecting the circulation of negotiable instruments, in order to eliminate long-standing abuses and prevent future occurrences, added an item to Article 46 of the industry regulations, stipulating that the method of reporting loss and stopping payment of remittance orders should be handled in accordance with bank notes, requiring the issuing shop to send the funds to the association for safekeeping, emphasizing credibility, and preventing the abuse of easy loss reports. Since this matter was discussed and handled, many shops have complied with and implemented it, and will never lightly comply with customers' requests for accommodation. The association deeply agrees with this move and hopes that all member shops will be able to comply, so that the credit of negotiable instruments among money shops will increase day by day.</p>
<h3>Meticulous Investigation of Husband Murder Case Underway</h3>
<p>In the tragic case of Zhan Zhou murdering her husband Zhan Yunying, the murderer was captured on the spot, and the coroner confirmed that the deceased was indeed killed with a kitchen knife and dismembered into more than ten pieces, which were put into a gray leather suitcase in an attempt to destroy the evidence. The deceased has been sent to the Pushan Villa for burial. The murderer and suspect have been interrogated by the prosecutor's office once, and the police bureau's application for continued investigation for two weeks has been approved. It is reported that the new Chenfen Police Station, which is handling the case, arrested the murderer's lover, He Xianhui (He Damazi), a few days ago. The suspects have not yet made a definite confession, and the detective Wang Zhengwei is meticulously investigating and collecting evidence. In recent days, some idle people have spread rumors that the murderer Zhan Zhou will be paraded through the streets as a warning, which is completely unfounded. The authorities hope that the public will not believe the rumors and cause unnecessary disturbances. Once the authorities have completed the investigation, they can make a public announcement.</p>
<p>Also, after the case occurred, many people rushed to the scene to inquire. A few days ago, a gangster named Zhang Tianbao impersonated a public official and entangled the landlord Wang Bianyang at the scene, attempting to intimidate and extort money. His impersonation was recognized by detectives, and Zhang was taken to the station for interrogation. It is reported that Zhang Tianbao has committed multiple cases of impersonating public officials to intimidate and extort money and is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was the Birthday of the Flowers: Free Vaccination</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th) was the Birthday of the Flowers. The Municipal Health Bureau, in order to prevent the spread of smallpox and protect the health of the citizens, specially assigned nurses to each health branch to provide free smallpox vaccinations on this day. The director of the Epidemic Prevention Section of the Medical Affairs Department of the bureau, Yu Youxun, personally went to each place to inspect and guide the work.</p>
<h3>Readjustment Will Be Implemented</h3>
<p>In order to promote the work, the Municipal Construction Bureau convened a meeting of the directors of various district offices a few days ago. Director Xu personally attended and gave many instructions on promoting the work in the future. The bureau decided on several important cases at this meeting. In addition to the central district office remaining as usual, the various district offices will be readjusted. It is reported that the bureau plans to merge the two ship and vehicle registration offices in Nanshi and Zhabei into the office, and expand the vehicle registration office in Huxi into an office, still handling both ship and vehicle registration. This adjustment plan is being submitted to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>"Small Newspaper" Published: The large-format small newspaper "Small Newspaper" was launched yesterday. The newspaper is published every afternoon, reporting important domestic and foreign news of the day, social trends, financial market conditions, entertainment news, and has a supplement "Small Words," written by famous writers in a humorous and serious manner, full of dazzling content. Each copy sells for 40 yuan, and commemorative subscriptions are now being solicited.</p>
<h3>Charitable Organizations Prepare to Evacuate: Fill Out Survey Forms and Submit to the Evacuation Committee's Survey and Design Group</h3>
<p>The Evacuation Committee has decided to first assist the charitable organizations in this city to evacuate, with one month as the preparation period for evacuation and one month later the committee will notify the implementation of the evacuation. The committee is now actively preparing water and land transportation. According to the person in charge of the committee's survey and design group, it is hoped that the charitable organizations in this city will actively prepare for evacuation on the one hand, and fill out the survey forms and submit them to the group for reference. The survey items include:</p>
<p>(1) Name and address of the charitable organization.</p>
<p>(2) Names of the board of directors and the actual person in charge.</p>
<p>(3) Financial status and sources of income for the most recent year.</p>
<p>(4) Total number of people currently and number of people preparing to evacuate.</p>
<p>(5) Whether there is a destination for evacuation or a suitable place that can be found.</p>
<p>(6) Number and name of necessary luggage and equipment to be carried during evacuation. (It is best to estimate the area and weight.)</p>
<p>(7) What preparations have been made for economic aspects after evacuation, and whether there are any coping methods. The above survey form should be completed and submitted to the Evacuation Committee's Survey and Design Group (inside the Shen Bao newspaper office on Sanma Road) within ten days from the date of publication.</p>

<h3>Obligatory Elementary School Actively Prepares; Scheduled to Open on April 1st; Hoping that Baojia (Neighborhood Watch) Will Inform Out-of-School Children to Register</h3>
<p>The obligatory elementary school is progressing with preparations, relying on the enthusiastic assistance of all parties, and is progressing smoothly. The two matters of borrowing school buildings and selecting teachers have been decided, and the textbooks used by the students have also been donated by various circles, and continue to be collected from all parties. As for the funding, the start-up expenses have been donated 1 million yuan by the charity market, so there is no problem. Although the recurring expenses have been supported by readers who have successively contributed to the "Obligatory School Fund," judging from the results of one week, the most enthusiastic donors are limited to the scope of the students of each school, and most of them are elementary school students and poor students. This phenomenon on the one hand shows the purest sympathy, and on the other hand proves that it has not yet aroused a general response from all walks of life. We sincerely appeal to all readers, especially those with resources who are familiar with education, to come forward and support. Now we are preparing to open school on April 1st, and we must start recruiting students tomorrow or the day after. We run obligatory education, of course, hoping to give the opportunity of obligatory education to every out-of-school child. Although at present we can only run ten schools due to various environmental reasons, we consider that the parents of out-of-school children may not see the newspaper and do not know that there is an obligatory school. Therefore, in order to ensure that out-of-school children do not miss the opportunity, we request the assistance of the baojia (neighborhood watch). For example, if there are out-of-school children in households near the obligatory school, the baojia can inform them and instruct them to register at the school. On the one hand, the Shen Bao Obligatory Education Committee will send a letter to the chief lianzhang (chief neighborhood watch leader) to request assistance.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Students Sympathize with Elementary School Students</h3>
<p>All the students of the third grade of the Ningbo Shanghai Alumni Association Sixth Elementary School wrote to say: "When we were in class, we heard Mr. Jiren tell us that your newspaper is founding an obligatory elementary school for many children who cannot study because of poverty, and launched the "Obligatory School Fund" movement, and many children have responded. We were very moved when we heard this, and now we have collected 5,000 yuan, please include it under the "Obligatory School Fund" item. And we hope that all the children in the city will unite and respond to this meaningful movement, and that way, children who have no books to read will have the opportunity to study."</p>
<h3>Nanshi Civilian Hospital: Free Tuberculosis Examination</h3>

If your office introduces middle and elementary school teachers and poor patients to the hospital for examination, they will be allowed to do so free of charge, limited to five people per day, to promote and do our best."</p>

<h3>Rice in Zhenru</h3>
<p>— Xi Jia</p>
<p>Zhenru is located in the northwest corner of Shanghai's urban area, bordering Jiading to the west and connecting to Laoshan to the north. It is the first stop on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway departing from Shanghai. The Taoshupu River runs north-south, allowing civilian boats to reach the Yangtze River and Suzhou Creek. Highways are also well-connected, reaching various nearby locations. Before the war, National Jinan University was located opposite the station, its architecture extremely magnificent. The Zhengfeng College of Arts and the Ministry of Communications' International Radio Station were also located here, and the residences of important figures and Western-style houses were numerous, so it attracted quite a bit of attention.</p>
<p>The Procession of Rice</p>
<p>From Caojiadu Bridge, a wide and flat road stretches northwest, extending straight through Zhenru to Nanxiang. Nanxiang is a large distribution center for rice and grains, with over a hundred rice shops there. Every day, five to six hundred people from Shanghai go there to buy rice, almost all of them men. Only a small number of these men walk and carry it on their shoulders; about eight out of ten ride bicycles. According to a precise estimate by a resident of Zhenru, at most times, up to five hundred bicycles pass through here. On this road, bicycles come and go in a continuous stream, some ridden by laborers, some by merchants, some by students, and occasionally dotted with green-uniformed postmen. Those heading north sped lightly, while those coming from the south had two large sacks heavily loaded behind their bikes, with a Western flour sack pressed on top. Some even carried a Western flour sack on the front handlebars. Their highest record was three *shi* (approximately 300 pounds). Rice thus flowed into every alley in Shanghai.</p>
<p>A Variety of Livelihoods</p>
<p>Zhenru's main product is vegetables. Every grocery store in Zhenru sells vegetable seeds: amaranth seeds, chive seeds, rapeseed seeds, artemisia seeds, scallion seeds, everything is available. In Xiaoli, there is also the Zhenru branch of the Shanghai Central Market, which opens at 2 PM every day, and its prices differ from those of the main market. These days, because of the warm weather and abundant rainfall, vegetables grow extremely quickly. Purchase prices have had to plummet. Cabbage only sells for 220 (currency not specified), and spinach has fallen even lower to 130. The Caojiadu vegetable market and the residents of Shanghai's northwest corner mostly get their vegetables from here. Its rich output can be imagined.</p>
<p>There is also a temporary rice market. At a glance, there are more than a hundred stalls, and the crowd is amazing! Most of the rice merchants from Shanghai who live nearby come here to buy rice. The rice merchants of Zhenru, who buy from Nanxiang, also mostly sell it here. Originally, there were six or seven large rice shops in Zhenru, but there were too many problems, so they closed their shops and set up rice stalls instead. This definitely reduced a lot of hassle and saved a lot of expenses.</p>
<p>About two *li* northwest of Zhenru Station is Yangjia Bridge. This is an important route for passing through Shanghai and Nanxiang, making it a good place for rice merchants to grab a bite. Small restaurants, noodle shops, griddle cake stalls, and dumpling shops stand one after another, all bustling with activity, and seats are always full. Several places selling Shandong steamed buns are doing especially well. Although each one sells for 200 (currency not specified), they are still snatched up by the steamer-full. It is estimated that such eateries account for eight-tenths of all the shops in the town, more than forty in total!</p>
<p>In Yangjia Bridge, there is a small flour mill called "Shenfeng," which has been established for almost two years. It operates day and night, producing more than three hundred bags a day. However, due to electricity restrictions, it can only operate for one day and then stop for two days. This naturally leads to a situation of supply falling short of demand. Many master bakers from the city's pancake stalls, griddle cake stalls, and noodle shops come here to buy one or two bags when flour is cheap. Now, because wheat is expensive, and more flour from Suzhou and Wuxi is arriving in Shanghai, business is not as good.</p>
