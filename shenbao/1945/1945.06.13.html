<h3>錫洽萬民盲從　先天道內幕</h3>
<p>— 余彧</p>
<p>不斷發生暴動事件</p>
<p>當地王炳珊部隊，是他們唯一的仇　對象，原因王部隊在該地收捐總重，米每畝十五斤，尚有其他雜捐，件之發端，其後道徒份子複雜，指揮導，又不統一主其事者，亦無法控制，接着乃有三月三日之「長涇橋事件」，三月四日之「朱家巷事件」，三月二十六日「羊尖事件」，四月三月之「坊前鎭事件」等，短短一二月，而修案迭有發生。</p>
<p>其次，附近的其他軍隊，如包漢生·章曉光等，以及苛捐雜稅的吏胥，區鄉鎮及保長，地痞惡聯等，只要平時奸詐勒索，爲紂助虐者，都是他們報復的對象，而被他們捕殺了不少。從他們勢力膨服之後，凡一切田賦捐稅，及軍警供　費，槪不納付，對方懾於威勢，運正當收人，也不敢下鄉催促了。</p>
<p>蔓延至江陰一帶</p>
<p>在江陰方面，自三月初開始，也漸由無錫安鎮一帶，經過東湖塘。黃土塘。而至長涇鎮等地蔓延過來，因爲先天道目的在抗納捐稅，故吸引力極大，民衃加入者殊多。到四月初旬，已普道傳到第四區竹塘，第二區周莊薛家巷，尤以薛家巷農民，幾乎全被吸引，而發爲先天道徒了。於是他們一方面集中各鄉鎮的鐵匠，在薛家巷內，趕製大刀，經費各人自備，困苦的人，就把農具作爲武器；每日在村鎮周圍站岡放哨，儼然如正規軍隊。還有一件極慘的事，便是四月十一日上午，周莊淸鄉大隊第二中隊隊長陳炳炎，帶了五十一個隊員，出發至某地，在　途中經過薛家巷附近，見有數十個先天遭大刀隊站崗，在隊伍中的一員，　然見了大刀隊的持　恕目而視，心裏發生能　，便　天發了一槍，那些大刀隊，一聽見槍聲，立刻分出一部分回云報告，鳴　示警，大家持刀拿槍，四面包圍，京這樣毫無抵抗地被生擒了，押至先犬道會內，被詢問了一小時餘，結果在下午四時左右，完全被殺，並將營長之類四人的首級，高掛在周莊高處。當時軍警當局及日方警備隊得到情報，派大隊人馬往教，但尚未出城時，惡耗已經傳來，形勢更見嚴重，立刻趕往進動，與大刀　接觸後，終以武器相　很遠，大刀隊不支後退，結果當地房屋燒去不少，人民逃散並且死傷數十人。</p>
<p>其後漸　延至江陰第五區及第八區，該道幹部大事宜傳，第一鄉鎮幾完全加入，聲勢極盛。並在居民較多的村莊，設立香堂，稱爲「昆法」，服裝完全黑色，有時在錫深公路兩旁，可以看見黑衣黑帽，掛刀拿槍的先天道徒，往來行動，對於客商無所戚脅，但對軍警人員時加襲擊，並對各地鄉鎭長强治附加，否則予以不利。</p>
<p>當局勸諭改編自衛團</p>
<p>先天道產生之時，因係秘密活勤，加以又在鄉區，故當局不甚注意，迨事態嚴重，慘劇相繼發生，當地縣政府鹽於不可助長；一方面立即呈報省政府，請示機宜，一面召集各區鄉紳及有力人士，輾轉勸臉。當由任省長於五月八日電令無錫縣長張修明氏，務須嚴加取締，限於五月二十日前解除武裝，如不聽勸告，格殺不論，並出示佈告，復派黃錫涯等組織流動宣傳隊，携帶大批宣傳品及標語，分別至京滬沿綫（自安事起至無錫止）各城市鄉村，深入民間，作普遍宣傳；無錫縣方，遵奉省令，轉飭各區鄉鎭，組織壯丁宜傳隊，破除迷信，積機闡揚。張縣長曾於三月三日，偕保安隊副隊長徐梅初，警察局長　桓等，赴第四區安鎭，在區署召集民衃大會，曉以地方洽安爲重，不得再有妄行，過去因農民係受愚所致，故決不　旣往。四月六日，張氏復盾關係方面及所屬部員，至一三四各區視察，與各皺地「先天道」負責人會談。四月十三日，各區「先天道佛力保家會「代表　子裕及趙晋卿等四十九人，奉召至錫，於當日下午舉行座談會，到關係方面及各保安隊警察局長等，由縣長主持，說明政府對於「佛力保家會」之對策，厥在希望能協助政府，推行政令，維護治安，該會停止活動，將「佛力保家會」名義取消，改編爲自衛團。十四日繼續舉行連談會，決定將「佛力保家會」改編爲　衛團，活動地區縮小範圍，以第三區爲限，下午簽訂幫約書，四月廿六日，焚方在安鎮舉行聯合追悼會，追悼歷次殉難軍警，及先天道道徒。</p>
<p>誓約書簽訂後，在第一，第六，第九及第十區之道徒，平時雖與三四區互通聲息，但已由於不良份子　入，故該道之代表，已失去指揮力量，難於統一。同時該會道徒，智識幼稚，以爲縣方命令改編爲自衛團，已准活動，乃藉口以自衛爲名義，凡與彼等不愜者，明目張胆與之衝突，因之不幸事件，仍時有發生。如四月廿九日，第十區先天道徒四百餘人，將大支鄉鄉公所加以包圍，汚辱鄉長及保長。五月四日及五日，局山浜海關轉口稅局，被大批先天道徒衝入，兩日北被殺死四人，綁去六人。五月六日，先天道徒三千餘人，衝入鐵路封鎖綫東無錫站大檢問所，將該所一切器物，全部搗毀。五月七日，曾任無錫第一區區長楊鴻淸，在江溪橋附近被先天道徒殺害。總計自簽訂暫約書後，有與軍警誤會者，有挾仇報復者，前後不下二十餘件。（轉入第二版）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>為疏散問題告市民</h3>
<p>本市疏散人口問題，我們曾迭有論列，漸由理論而致於賽施，雖然因有種種事實上的困難，人口疏散委員會未能迅速實施疏散計劃，但負責各方面監於茲事意于重大，仍力排萬難，努力進行。最近準備工作，漸告完成，第一期於本月十一日　駛蘇州疏散專船，票價每人三千三百三十元，十歲以下免費。凡欲疏散歸鄉之市民，均可前社該會執行組指定之保甲區先行登記，辦理移動。並爲便利疏散市民計，其手續力求簡易。</p>
<p>不過，反觀一般市民，對於疏散一事，仍多抱着觀望熊度，尤其令人不解的，是一般慈善團體。按照疏散委員會的原定計劃，第一步即爲疏散本市慈善團體，這是因爲慈善團體沒有滯留於上海的必要，而每一慈善團體收容相當多數的消費份子。口常生活消耗爲數不少，在此糧食及物價日趟高漲之際，慈善團體及早疏散，尤有絕對必要。過去疏散會方面召集慈魯團體代表談話，亦會一致贊同。但時至今日，除極少數以外，大都未作動散準備。雜善團體疏散地點，有洞庭西山及角直等地，均有餘屋租貸，當地糧食取給，亦較上海爲易，至於交通問題，目前航路陸路均已籌有具體辦法，疏散費用，當局又可酌量補助，在此情形下，慈善團體仍不圖從速自動疏散，殊無理由可言。如再不準備疏散，則社會各界捐助惟有警時停止。</p>
<p>其次，我們認爲一般市民的生活，邇來日形困難，特別是食糧問題，更爲嚴重。　就食糧困難而言，如無留滬必要者，自應備力設法，及早疏散，以免坐困愁城，遭受生活威脅。過去在交通上成爲問題者，現在各地疏散路族漸次開關，而蘇州等地方當局，對於本市疏散工作，尤願多方協助，因此，疏散者不但沿途絕無問題，即到達目的地後，亦可得種種便利。反之，如茍且偷安留發於上海一隅，則困難更不待　。即就個人利害打算，也有從速疏散之必要。</p>
<p>更爲謀促進市民疏散工作，希望各同鄉會及各同業公會負責指導協助同鄉及會員疏散。同時，本市及各地有關方面，對於疏散之市民，在出境入境檢查之時極力予以方便。此外，我們曾一再提出推進本市人口疏散，當以防止反疏散爲前提，故當局今後對於向上海市內移住者，必須嚴定限制辦法，否則去者依依而來者躍躍，對於本市疏散工作實爲一大阻礙，有關當局不能不加以重視。</p>

<h3>特戈爾閘明法堅強立塲</h3>
<p>百倫十二日中央社電據巴黎報告稱；特戈一爾曾於上週末旅行至諾曼第時發表演說，其大意謂，目前此種國際間可怖之現狀，實由於小國欲使大國陷於不能團結十致之險境所致。然該項大國之一致團結，乃爲世界各國蔪求和平所不可或缺乏要素。我法國雖於今日陷入困境，然未必永遠如此，故於現在各國欲對我法國作輕視之舉動，實非智者所爲。如有人以爲將大國之團給一致破皺，然後再利用此腐敗之環境，將法國視同世界象棋盤上之一名小卒，勢將成鑄大錯，將來必有難以逆料之事發生。我人必須征服芟除一般不知使大國分解有危險之人所置在我人道路上之障礙物。各國不與法國合作或與之訂立協定，則世界之和平難　確立，我全法民衃不顧此惡劣環境，堅持其不可動搖之立塲，我法國人深知月前所缺之物，而將盡力以公正勇氣堅毅獲得云。</p>

<h3>開掘個人防空壕應注意各點</h3>
<p>防空本部當局發表談話</p>
<p>上海特別市市長防空本部，頃就本市各處普遍開掘個人防空壕，發表談話，指出該項防空壕之應注意各點。茲錄談話內容如次：</p>
<p>在此防空設施強化周內，由各位市民熱心努力，市內各處已普遍開掘個人防空壕，誠蜀可喜之現象。此種個人防空壕大都開掘於人行道上街旁一帶，此更可使防空壕發揮其效果，惟猶應予注意者有以下各點：</p>
<p>第一，防空壕四周未堆築泥園者頗多，此在防止炸彈爆裂之風力，將減少效果，故在壕之四周，必須堆以泥園，目以傾斜形式及寬厚為宜，有數處即在馬路與人行道之交界線，揭起人行道上之數石，開掘防空壕，故壕旁堆築泥園，僅有三面，一馬對馬路，此實蜀危險。</p>
<p>第二，防空壕四周泥園，不能僅利用泥土，為抵抗大雨及爆炸風力，必須泥中　以切細稻草或混入水泥，俾能強固，又外表宜使之光滑。</p>
<p>第三，個人防空壕以掘於人行道為多，為防止夜行人危險，四周應圍以石灰，白漆，或白紙等，俾使行人注意，一度遭受突襲，防空壕即能保護市民之生命，故宜時常保持壕內清潔。</p>

<h3>雜糧公會範圍縮小</h3>

<h3>銀錢各業明日休假</h3>
<p>本月十四日為舊厲端午節，本市銀錢兩業各銀行錢莊，增印依照銀錢業聯席會議規定之休假表，於是日舉行夏節例假一天，兩業公會，爭關會，票據交換所，錢備庫，錢業市場等，亦同時休假，停止辦公，所有同業及客戶交換及到期收解，均改於次日補辦清楚。此外如中橋泥行，郵政儲金　業局，及外商銀行公會，各大外商銀行，暨證交各市場等，亦於是日分別休假一天。據悉本年夏節，銀錢業對各眾放款較少，百分之八十均為定期借款，故行莊同業開頭寸如常，商號公司工廠，因與客戶及同業間頗多往來，大率於此夏節期前辦理對外結賬，昨今兩日，各業情形，頗呈繁忙。</p>
<h3>近東各民族採取獨立自主政策</h3>
<p>松平部長發表談話</p>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所主持之報道常會，昨（十二）日下午三時循便舉行，由松平情報部長就英美在近東阿拉伯撤軍問題發表談話，略謂——最近英美軍從近東阿拉伯撤退，查過去英美向近東阿拉件派遣駐軍之原因，由於　昔德國進展巴爾乾，英美深恐德軍進駐土耳其，埃及，阿拉伯，伊朗等方面，為抗衡德軍計，不異將軍隊進駐該地，如今歐戰告一段落後，故英美之撤軍乃為勢所必然，但至目前，英美仍未實行撤軍，而法特戈兩政權，深恐法舊有勢力在敘利亞。黎巴嫩之範圍內被英勢力奪取，頗為　　,特將法軍增駐黎敘等地，願為引起阿拉伯人與法人之摩擦，繼而伊朗國方面又正式向英美蘇要求撤兵，故近東阿拉伯人之獨立，因該二事件之發生，加深更大之刺激，為迫使英美兩國，不得不對近東問題再予考慮。鑒于上述情形，該伊拉克，埃及等國，亦採取同樣要求，發動舆论要求英美軍之撤駐，可知此次大戰之教訓，定使該地哉之各民族採取獨立自主之政策。</p>
<h3>先天道內幕（自第一版轉來）</h3>
<p>省府推進宣撫工作</p>
<p>眾省府鑒于忍無可忍，乃　令錫澄處系府，加緊宣撫工作，至五月廿日止，如先天道徒不服宣撫，不繳武器，再有反抗行動者，即採取剿滅辦法，復　置　團指揮部，任命楊彦斌為指揮官，楊氏於五月廿九日，留張帶宜機，現工作仍在推進，記者等由錫赴澄時，沿公路附近，見分駐清鄭軍甚多，錫澄公路沿線，本有先天道持械出沒，而目前已無此行動。</p>
<p>綠江　省政府佈告如下：（種田濟田，孝順父母，受國愛家，完納稅　，順從法律，尊重官府，為人之道，要走正路，打倒邪教，識字讀書，樂業安居，聚眾　　，國法不許，　犯刑章，　　妻孥，願我弟兄，牢記此語。）</p>
<p>抄錄無錫政府佈告如下：（願得先天道徒，迭經　　周詳，限期五月二十，最後機會莫忘，距離為日無變，重申發令三章，第一繳銷武器，不准拋業　蔽，第二禁止聚眾，袁即散眾四鄉，第三不許洗頭，各自安土守韁，凡此禁絕克踐，其他當可實諒，緊要關頭已到，幸勿　　　　，須知綱無兼用，原為除惡安良，同曉肅清厲共，務使不擾荷莊，所有軍警供應，政府解決有方，並經通令　　，安民為民殃，從此安爾居樂，勿得亂口張揚，爺即　　禁約，盡早勒馬迦疆，倘再執迷不司，立見據伐大張，屆時後悔莫及，身家自取滅亡。）</p>
<p>先天道代表在錫被扣</p>
<p>期間，五月六日，曾有先天道各區代表倪予才等十二人，另有此京先天道總會參議張智先一人，因感事態嚴重，深為戒張，乃進其活動，並於當號設宴，有關方面認為有扣留之必要，　會同體　，當將全體道眾十三人拘捕，扣將於保安隊內，候省方處置。記者等訪問系政府時，曾與倪子才張青光等，作詳細之會談。</p>
<p>金光法試驗無</p>
<p>如果沒有五月十八日，（金光法）在無錫當眾試驗，恐怕先天道的勢　，一時不會平戰。原來自倪子才等十三人被扣押後，有宜與人秉明渡等數十人，見先天道失去領尊之人，同時鑒于先天道勢力廣大，很有利用的可能，乃進入三國兩區，偽稱（金光法），系北京方面派來，其道法較起先的先天道，更高深清奧，人其道者，須秋九九八十一刀，並謬稱用乎道一個（廖），把另一手向空一招，即能使　　從空中跌下，晨民約頭　本來已經受了妖氣的茶　，正在愁失去領導人之時，忽然有這樣更高明的道師前來相助，真是太難得了，當然深信不疑，奉如上由，因之不到半月，道徒之　　，與迷信之深，真是有過之而無不及。</p>
<p>這姜明波一批人，為費要公開濟張他們的勢力，使當局相信他們的所謂無中生有的妖法，竟異想天開，不　生死，乃作孤注一擲的。於五月中旬，舊面要求無錫孫府，謂該道刀槍不入之法，確有其事，自愿來系，當眾試驗，當局初加勸阻，後以彼等自愿減裂，同時處於眾民受其之深，長往以往，前途甚惫，若不加以實驗，不足以使人民覺醒，據約於五月十八，由系政府通節沿途軍警，准予來誠。</p>
<p>是日，姜明波帶了得意道徒數十人，要求以填關論試驗，地點是洛社橋頭警備隊附近，其時旁觀民眾共有二萬餘人，試驗時，姜明波任意指定道徒五人，頭包白布，積黑色密門鈕釦　　，　宣在三百公尺以外，鍾鳴三下，姜某等作演完畢，即與驗其所謂（落均攤眾），　　　　，企圖閃遠，但擔　槍，早　　　，　　月　，擔　　　，　妾某等六人，即隨即　　　；面所謂（刀槍不入）之所說，至此也千當眾揭曉。</p>
<p>自此實驗後，絡實無工作一極有力之　　,一般善男信女，月擊此等情事，覺（道高一籌）的（金光法）教師，尚且作法不想，於是對先天道之邪說，還立即冷淡，猶恐當局加以勸伐，乃紛紛脫離，將刀槍自動交出，先天道之勢力，頓時消減大半，雖有一部份別有用意者，曾想作最後之掙扎，力言那天驗無效，是因為正印星高厲（言各　觀長官）並有　　不潔的東西，其實晨長雖愚，亦已失卻信仰，除非為彼等勢力曾待，無法脫離。</p>
<p>現在先天道的餘孽，在錫澄處三系僻處尚有，但勢力已不大，僅系自衛性質，各地系政當局，（有軍警供應，政府解決有方，並經通令檢閱，安民勿為殃民），倘能做到這一點，人民期望的不過如此，預料不久將來，不動干戈，即能使先天道餘孽，全部自滅。（全文完）</p>

<h3>Defending the Strongholds in Southern Okinawa, Japanese Forces Continue to Fight Fiercely, Special Attack Units Launch Relentless Raids on Enemy Ships</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands, 12th (Central News Agency) – Since the end of May, enemy forces in the southern area of Okinawa Island have been gradually advancing southward from the Yonabaru area, increasing pressure on the Japanese defensive positions at Shuri and Naha. Japanese forces have withdrawn their battle lines, inflicting heavy damage on the pursuing enemy, and are now defending established strongholds in the Ozato area and the Shimajiri district in the south, continuing their brave resistance. From the enemy landing on April 1st to the evening of June 6th, confirmed battle results include over 72,000 enemy soldiers killed, 663 enemy tanks destroyed, 218 artillery pieces destroyed, 170 barracks destroyed, over 60 food and ammunition depots destroyed, and a large quantity of ammunition destroyed. Furthermore, Japanese special attack units are still continuing their fierce attacks against the enemy. For example, on the 10th, special attack planes daringly attacked enemy ships around Okinawa Island with their entire aircraft. Battle results confirmed at noon that day included the sinking of one enemy cruiser, one destroyer, and one vessel of unknown type.</p>
<p>Forward Air Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese "Shibu" special attack units continued to fiercely attack enemy ships around Okinawa Island on the 10th and 11th, inflicting extreme damage on the enemy. On the morning of the 10th, ground units confirmed the sinking or destruction of one large enemy vessel of an unknown type. Significant battle results were also achieved during the attack on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Tarakan Tenaciously Defend the Front Lines, Ready to Launch Fierce Counterattacks at Any Moment</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – Japanese defending forces in the Tarakan area are tenaciously defending the front lines, launching fierce counterattacks against enemy forces relying on reinforcements to force a breakthrough. They are also conducting heroic hand-to-hand combat attacks at night, reportedly having killed or wounded over 2,800 enemy soldiers recently.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 11th (Central News Agency) – Japanese defending forces on Tarakan Island have been fighting bloody battles for over 40 days, killing the enemy's highest commander and over 2,500 enemy soldiers, greatly undermining the enemy's offensive plans. Since the 3rd, the enemy has reinforced its forces, subjected the Japanese positions to naval gunfire, and used incendiary bombs to burn the dense forest area on the flanks of the Japanese positions, while simultaneously launching continuous day and night attacks on the Japanese positions, causing the battle situation to become tense since the 9th.</p>
<h3>Over 300 American Ships Lost</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report, Washington – The U.S. Navy Department announced on the night of the 11th that four ships have been lost: the U.S. destroyer "Ruchin," the "Tolessa," the high-speed transport "Bay," and the landing ship transport LSM-135. Due to the loss of these ships, 469 personnel were killed, wounded, or went missing. Since the start of the war, the U.S. Navy has lost a total of 314 ships.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report, San Francisco – The U.S. War Shipping Administration recently announced that the merchant ship "Canadian Victoria," while transporting supplies to Okinawa Island, was attacked by Japanese aircraft and sank within minutes.</p>

<h3>Japanese Emergency Measures Bill Passed by Both Houses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Diet held a plenary session at 9:18 AM on the 12th. First, the government-submitted wartime emergency measures bill was discussed. Prime Minister Suzuki explained the reasons for the proposal and specifically handed it over to the House of Representatives for deliberation.

<h3>British Clergy Oppose Indiscriminate American Bombing of Japan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report, Shanghai – According to a London dispatch on May 8th, British clergy issued a statement saying that the indiscriminate bombing of Japan by American aircraft is an inhumane act. This kind of indiscriminate bombing is no different from the indiscriminate bombing of Germany and is an equally inhumane act. The clergy also stated that they cannot abandon their efforts to resolve the issue in a way that does not violate democratic principles, and that indiscriminate bombing represents the degradation of Western civilization.</p>
<h3>Macau Suffers Another Air Raid</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) – At 1:10 PM on the 11th, a B-29 type aircraft intruded into Macau territory, targeting the former Panamanian merchant ship "Masbaton" docked there. It dropped 50-kilogram bombs several times, but failed to hit the target. It then strafed the surrounding area with machine guns before leaving. Over a dozen civilians were injured.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Hardships of the American War Against Japan</h3>
<p>Former Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – A diary was found in the uniform pocket of Navy Lieutenant Sulaofu, a pilot from the U.S. 38th Mobile Task Force's 4th Air Group carrier "Shangri-La," who was shot down by Japanese fighters in the Southwest Sea. According to the diary, the enemy is suffering immensely. Sulaofu was the flight leader, and his unit had 12 aircraft. He had accumulated a total flight distance of 3,600 hours. Sulaofu was born in Ohio and had fought against German fighters on the European front. This was his first deployment on the Pacific front. One page of the diary stated that the "Shangri-La" was fully supplied and arrived at Ulithi on the 23rd, berthed for a week, and then sailed to Okinawa, later returning to Ulithi once. On April 26th, it departed again for Okinawa to participate in operations there. Due to a shortage of ships and extremely difficult food conditions, the "Shangri-La" did not have sufficient food supplies, especially meat, alcohol, and cigarettes. At Ulithi, he first saw six aircraft carriers, two of which were immobile and four of which were heavily damaged. The second time, there were four aircraft carriers docked, all of which were severely damaged, almost entirely by Japanese kamikazes.</p>
<p>Travelogue</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of the Blind Obedience of Tens of Thousands to the Xiantian Dao Sect</h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>Frequent Riots Occur</p>
<p>The local Wang Bingshan's troops are their only object of hatred. The reason is that Wang's troops collect heavy taxes in the area, fifteen pounds of rice per mu, in addition to other miscellaneous taxes. The initial spark was this, but later the members of the sect became complex, the command and guidance were not unified, and those in charge were unable to control the situation. This was followed by the "Changjing Bridge Incident" on March 3rd, the "Zhu Family Lane Incident" on March 4th, the "Yangjian Incident" on March 26th, and the "Fangqian Town Incident" in April. In just one or two months, numerous incidents have occurred.</p>
<p>Secondly, other nearby troops, such as Bao Hansheng and Zhang Xiaoguang, as well as the corrupt officials who levied heavy taxes, the district, township, and bao chiefs, and the local bullies, as long as they were usually cunning and extortionate, and helped the wicked, were all targets of their revenge, and many were captured and killed by them. Since their power expanded, they have not paid any field taxes, levies, or military and police supplies. The other side, intimidated by their power, dares not go to the countryside to urge payment of legitimate income.</p>
<p>Spreading to Jiangyin and its Vicinity</p>
<p>In the Jiangyin area, since the beginning of March, it has gradually spread from the Anzhen area of Wuxi, through Donghutang and Huangtutang, to Changjing Town and other places. Because the purpose of the Xiantian Dao sect is to resist taxes and levies, it is extremely attractive, and many people have joined. By the beginning of April, it had spread to Zhutang in the fourth district and Xuejia Lane in Zhouzhuang in the second district. In particular, almost all the farmers in Xuejia Lane were attracted and became members of the Xiantian Dao sect. Thus, on the one hand, they concentrated blacksmiths from various towns in Xuejia Lane to rush to make broadswords. Each person prepared their own funds, and those who were poor used their farm tools as weapons. Every day, they stood guard around the villages and towns, like regular troops. Another extremely tragic event occurred on the morning of April 11th, when Chen Bingyan, the captain of the Second Company of the Zhouzhuang Clearing Brigade, took fifty-one soldiers and set out for a certain place. On the way, they passed near Xuejia Lane and saw dozens of Xiantian Dao members standing guard with broadswords. One of the soldiers in the team suddenly saw a member of the broadsword team staring angrily at him with his broadsword. He felt frightened and fired a shot into the sky. The broadsword team immediately sent a part back to report and sounded the alarm. Everyone took up their knives and guns and surrounded them from all sides. They were captured without resistance and taken to the Xiantian Dao assembly hall. After being interrogated for over an hour, they were completely killed around 4:00 PM, and the heads of four people, including the company commander, were hung high in Zhouzhuang. When the military and police authorities and the Japanese garrison received the information, they sent a large force to rescue them, but before they had left the city, the bad news had already arrived, and the situation became even more serious. They immediately rushed to attack. After contacting the broadsword team, they were ultimately outmatched in weaponry, and the broadsword team retreated. As a result, many houses in the area were burned, and people fled, with dozens being killed or injured.</p>
<p>Later, it gradually spread to the fifth and eighth districts of Jiangyin. The sect cadres greatly promoted the sect, and almost the entire first township joined, with the momentum being extremely strong. They also set up incense halls in villages with more residents, called "Kun Fa," with clothing being completely black. Sometimes, on both sides of the Wuxi-Shanghai Highway, black-clothed, black-hatted Xiantian Dao members could be seen walking around with knives and guns. They did not threaten merchants, but they frequently attacked military and police personnel and forcefully levied additional taxes on township chiefs in various places, otherwise they would be treated unfavorably.</p>
<p>The Authorities Advise Reorganization into Self-Defense Corps</p>
<p>When the Xiantian Dao sect emerged, because it was a secret activity and also in the rural areas, the authorities did not pay much attention to it. When the situation became serious and tragedies occurred one after another, the local county government felt that it could not be allowed to grow. On the one hand, it immediately reported to the provincial government for instructions. On the other hand, it summoned gentry and influential people from various districts to repeatedly persuade and persuade. Provincial Governor Ren issued an order to Wuxi County Magistrate Zhang Xiuming on May 8th, ordering him to strictly ban it and disarm them by May 20th. If they did not listen to persuasion, they would be killed without exception. A public notice was issued, and Huang Xiya and others were sent to organize a mobile propaganda team, carrying a large number of propaganda materials and slogans, to go to various cities and villages along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway (from Anzhen to Wuxi) to carry out widespread propaganda among the people. Wuxi County followed the provincial order and instructed various districts and townships to organize strong men's propaganda teams to break superstitions and actively promote the truth. County Magistrate Zhang once went to Anzhen in the fourth district on March 3rd with Xu Meichu, the deputy captain of the security team, and Huan, the police chief, and convened a mass meeting of the people in the district office to inform them that local peace was important and that there should be no more recklessness. Because the farmers had been deceived in the past, it was decided not to punish them for their past actions. On April 6th, Zhang also inspected the first, third, and fourth districts with related parties and his subordinates and met with the persons in charge of the "Xiantian Dao" in various places. On April 13th, representatives of the "Xiantian Dao Buddhist Force for Protecting the Home" in various districts, Ziyu and Zhao Jinqing and 47 others, were summoned to Wuxi. A symposium was held that afternoon, attended by related parties and the police chiefs of various security teams, hosted by the county magistrate. The government's countermeasures for the "Buddhist Force for Protecting the Home" were explained, hoping to assist the government in promoting government orders and maintaining law and order, that the association would cease its activities, cancel the name "Buddhist Force for Protecting the Home," and reorganize into a self-defense corps. On the 14th, a joint meeting was held, deciding to reorganize the "Buddhist Force for Protecting the Home" into a self-defense corps, and the area of activity was reduced to the third district. In the afternoon, a pledge agreement was signed. On April 26th, a joint memorial service was held in Anzhen, commemorating the military police and Xiantian Dao members who had died in the past.</p>
<p>After the pledge agreement was signed, although the members of the sect in the first, sixth, ninth, and tenth districts usually communicated with the third and fourth districts, they had already lost their commanding power and it was difficult to unify them due to the intrusion of bad elements. At the same time, the members of the association were ignorant and thought that the county's order to reorganize into a self-defense corps had been approved for activity, so they used self-defense as an excuse to openly conflict with those who did not please them. As a result, unfortunate events still occurred from time to time. For example, on April 29th, more than 400 Xiantian Dao members in the tenth district surrounded the Dazhi Township Office, insulting the township chief and bao chief. On May 4th and 5th, the transshipment tax bureau of the Jushanhang Customs was stormed by a large number of Xiantian Dao members, and four people were killed and six abducted in two days. On May 6th, more than 3,000 Xiantian Dao members stormed the large checkpoint at the East Wuxi Station on the railway blockade line, destroying all the equipment in the station. On May 7th, Yang Hongqing, the former district chief of the first district of Wuxi, was killed by Xiantian Dao members near the Jiangxi Bridge. In total, since the signing of the temporary agreement, there have been no fewer than twenty incidents involving misunderstandings with the military police and revenge killings.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Message to the Citizens Regarding the Evacuation Problem</h3>
<p>We have repeatedly discussed the issue of population evacuation in this city, gradually moving from theory to implementation. Although there are various practical difficulties, the Population Evacuation Committee has not been able to implement the evacuation plan quickly. However, those responsible in various aspects, aware of the importance of this matter, are still overcoming all difficulties and working hard to move forward. Recently, preparatory work has been gradually completed. The first evacuation ship to Suzhou will depart on the 11th of this month. The fare is 3,330 yuan per person, and it is free for children under ten years old. Citizens who wish to evacuate to their hometowns can first register with the Baojia district designated by the executive group of the committee and complete the relocation procedures. To facilitate the evacuation of citizens, the procedures are made as simple as possible.</p>
<p>However, in contrast, most citizens still have a wait-and-see attitude towards evacuation. What is particularly perplexing is the attitude of general charitable organizations. According to the original plan of the Evacuation Committee, the first step is to evacuate charitable organizations in the city. This is because charitable organizations have no need to stay in Shanghai, and each charitable organization accommodates a considerable number of consumers. The daily life consumption is not small. At a time when food and prices are rising every day, it is absolutely necessary for charitable organizations to evacuate as soon as possible. In the past, the Evacuation Committee summoned representatives of charitable organizations to talk, and they unanimously agreed. But to this day, most have not made evacuation preparations, except for a very few. The evacuation locations for charitable organizations include Dongting West Mountain and Jiaozhi, where there are surplus houses for rent. It is also easier to obtain food locally than in Shanghai. As for the transportation problem, concrete measures have been planned for both waterways and roads. The authorities can also subsidize the evacuation costs as appropriate. Under these circumstances, there is no reason for charitable organizations not to evacuate automatically as soon as possible. If they do not prepare to evacuate, donations from all sectors of society will have to be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Secondly, we believe that the lives of ordinary citizens have become increasingly difficult recently, especially the food problem, which is even more serious. In terms of food difficulties, those who have no need to stay in Shanghai should make every effort to find a way to evacuate as soon as possible, to avoid being trapped in a city of worries and facing a threat to their lives. In the past, transportation was a problem. Now, evacuation routes in various places are gradually opening, and the authorities in Suzhou and other places are particularly willing to provide assistance to the city's evacuation work. Therefore, evacuees not only have no problems along the way, but also can obtain various conveniences after arriving at their destination. On the other hand, if they stay put in Shanghai, the difficulties will be even greater. Even from a personal point of view, it is necessary to evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>To promote the city's evacuation work, we hope that the various hometown associations and trade associations will be responsible for guiding and assisting the evacuation of their fellow countrymen and members. At the same time, relevant parties in the city and in various places should make it as easy as possible for evacuating citizens during exit and entry inspections. In addition, we have repeatedly proposed that the promotion of population evacuation in the city should be based on preventing counter-evacuation. Therefore, the authorities must strictly limit the methods for those who move into Shanghai in the future. Otherwise, those who leave will be reluctant, and those who come will be eager. This is a major obstacle to the city's evacuation work, and the relevant authorities must pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>The National Government Authorities Draft a Plan to Suppress Prices, Currently Negotiating with Relevant Parties</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang Governor Announces Administrative Policy: Stabilizing People's Livelihoods Considered an Urgent Priority</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Governor of Zhejiang Province, Ding Mocun, was sworn into office at the provincial government yesterday and announced his administrative policy as follows:</p>
<p>My current appointment to govern Zhejiang is premised on the hopes of the people. Whatever the people desire will be my future administrative direction. The reason for the delay in this announcement is that I believe governing lies in deeds, not words, and I did not want to offer empty promises. Now that I have been in office for over a month, I have closely examined the local situation and gained a clear understanding. Therefore, I have ordered each department to draft detailed and specific plans to alleviate the suffering of the people, abandoning empty talk and seeking practical solutions. I will now present a few of the more important points:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of people's food supply, this province will prioritize increasing the production of rice and other grains as a fundamental solution. Currently, in addition to personally consulting with the Jiangsu Province authorities regarding the transfer of grain to Hangzhou, I have also dispatched personnel to the Nanjing and northern Jiangsu areas to purchase large quantities of miscellaneous grains. These shipments will soon arrive in Hangzhou to meet the immediate needs.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of public security, the current police and security agencies are actively planning. In the future, Zhejiang's public security will surely improve step by step.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of civil affairs, the success of local administration depends entirely on the integrity and competence of officials. They must be honest. In addition to instructing subordinates to exert themselves, I will strictly prohibit corruption, to establish a clean government and win the trust of the people.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of police administration, the police have close contact with the people, and therefore, the people's suffering is more direct. Strict rectification is necessary to reduce the people's suffering. I have decided to start with active rectification in the provincial capital, and then gradually extend it to other counties.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of finance, the financial situation of this province is strained and difficult after years of war. I plan to implement thorough reforms, eliminate accumulated malpractices, and ensure that the people's burden does not increase, while tax revenues are sufficient.</p>
<p>Regarding water conservancy and transportation, in order to enhance smooth transportation, land and water transport are extremely important. Currently, important trunk roads within the province are either under construction or being planned. Regarding water conservancy, projects such as the Hai'ning seawall, the Shangtang River in Hangzhou County, and Xiang Lake in Xiaoshan are all planned for repair and construction, and work will commence soon.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of economics, Zhejiang Province is rich in resources. In recent years, these resources have not been sold effectively. In the future, we must improve public security and rectify transportation to facilitate transportation and the smooth flow of materials.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of education, I will make every effort to promote it. On the one hand, I will improve the treatment of cultural and educational personnel. On the other hand, I will appoint local educators to take charge of educational undertakings.</p>
<p>In my current role as governor of Zhejiang, I deeply desire to serve the people. To facilitate communication between the government and the people, and to ensure that the people's voices are heard, I have established an advisory committee. I hope that all elders and brothers will provide guidance and assistance at any time.</p>

<h3>Compromise Reached on Great Power Veto Issue: Soviet Union Also Concedes on Trusteeship Proposal</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from San Francisco reports that an agreement has been reached among the five major powers on the issue of voting procedures in the Security Council. Regarding the content of the agreement, the Procedure Committee of the Security Council issued a joint statement by the representatives of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China on the 8th. Simultaneously, the French representative also announced that they would adopt the same attitude as the statement. This is the first proposal unanimously issued by the five major powers regarding the Security Council's voting procedure. According to the statement, the investigation of disputes is a prerequisite for resolution measures. The Soviet side has conceded on its insistence on complete recognition of the great power veto, and the veto power will be limited to the stage after the investigation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from San Francisco, after the veto issue was resolved, the issue of trusteeship became a new difficulty. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, agreed on the 9th to withdraw his previous objections. One issue was that the administering power should strive to fulfill the free hopes of the peoples concerned, allowing them independence or autonomy. The second issue was the continuation of the mandates of the old League of Nations, but regarding the latter, he suggested that the provisions should be appended and not incorporated into the trusteeship system.</p>
<h3>Truman Expresses Rejection of French Proposal</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from Washington reports that, during a meeting with the press corps on the 6th, President Truman stated regarding the French government's proposal to convene a meeting of the five major powers to resolve the Levant dispute: "I do not wish to convene a meeting of the five powers to resolve this dispute. I am currently planning to convene a summit of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union."</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Affirms France's Strong Position</h3>
<p>London, 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Paris, De Gaulle delivered a speech while traveling to Normandy last weekend. The gist of his speech was that the current terrible international situation is due to small countries trying to put large countries in a position where they cannot unite. However, the united unity of these large countries is an indispensable element for all countries in the world to seek peace. Although my France is in a difficult situation today, it will not necessarily be so forever. Therefore, it is unwise for countries to despise my France at this time. If anyone thinks that the unity of the great powers should be broken, and then use this corrupt environment to regard France as a pawn on the world chessboard, they will make a big mistake, and unpredictable things will happen in the future. We must conquer and remove the obstacles placed in our path by those who do not know the danger of disuniting the great powers. If countries do not cooperate with France or conclude agreements with it, it will be difficult to establish world peace. The entire French people, regardless of this bad environment, adhere to their unwavering position. We French people deeply understand what we lacked a month ago and will do our best to obtain it with fairness, courage, and perseverance.</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Guizhou Province</h3>

Refugees in the Dushan area of southern Guizhou are eating grass roots to survive. In northern Guizhou, the price of vegetables in March of this year reached 1,500 yuan per catty, which was even higher than the price of meat in Chongqing at that time. In order to save this tragic situation, Yang Sen, the chairman of Guizhou Province, applied to the Chongqing authorities to not implement the grain and gold contribution campaign, but no improvement has been seen so far.</p>

<h3>Important Points to Note When Digging Individual Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>Statement by the Air Defense Headquarters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Air Defense Headquarters recently issued a statement regarding the widespread digging of individual air raid shelters in the city, pointing out the following important points to note for these air raid shelters. The content of the statement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>During this week of intensified air defense facilities, all citizens have enthusiastically worked hard, and individual air raid shelters have been widely dug throughout the city, which is a commendable phenomenon. Most of these individual air raid shelters are dug along the sidewalks and streets, which will further enhance their effectiveness. However, the following points should still be noted:</p>
<p>First, many air raid shelters do not have earthen berms around them, which will reduce their effectiveness in preventing the force of bomb explosions. Therefore, earthen berms must be built around the shelters, preferably with a sloping shape and width. In several places, several stones on the sidewalk at the boundary line between the road and the sidewalk have been removed to dig air raid shelters. Therefore, the earthen berms around the shelters only have three sides, with one side facing the road, which is actually very dangerous.</p>
<p>Second, the earthen berms around the air raid shelters should not only use soil. To resist heavy rain and explosive force, finely chopped straw should be mixed with the soil, or cement should be mixed in to strengthen it. The surface should also be made smooth.</p>
<p>Third, individual air raid shelters are mostly dug on sidewalks. To prevent danger to pedestrians at night, the surroundings should be surrounded by lime, white paint, or white paper to make pedestrians aware. Once attacked, air raid shelters can protect the lives of citizens, so the inside of the shelters should be kept clean at all times.</p>
<h3>Over 30,000 Taels of Third Installment of Gold Securities Sold</h3>
<p>Purchases Increase Periodically, with Enthusiastic Response</p>
<p>Since the issuance of gold securities by the Central Reserve Bank, they have been widely trusted by financial circles, merchants, and the public. After the first installment of gold securities matured, funds were redeemed on schedule, so buyers became even more enthusiastic. According to the inspection report of the Gold Securities Issuance Reserve Management Committee, the number of gold securities issued in the third installment has increased again. 1,248 taels were sold on the first day, 10,556 taels were sold on the second day, and 21,223 taels were sold on the third day, for a total of 33,027 taels. This is an increase of 19,070 taels compared to the 13,957 taels in the first installment, and an increase of 2,425 taels compared to the 30,602 taels in the second installment. The 3,303 gold bars in this installment's reserve have been delivered to the monthly inspection committee for inspection and confirmed to be consistent.</p>
<h3>Household Sugar Distribution After Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>The last distribution of household sugar in this city was over a month ago. The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and citizens are in urgent need of it. Sugar merchants have been requesting the detergent bureau and the China-Japan Trade Federation to implement a special household distribution for the Dragon Boat Festival. It is understood that the relevant authorities, considering the needs of the people, have agreed to distribute it. However, because the procedures for this special distribution could not be completed before the festival, the distribution will only take place after the festival.</p>
<h3>City Ferry Plans to Expand Routes</h3>
<p>The city ferry company authorities, in order to make it easier for residents in the north and south districts of Pudong to cross the Huangpu River, have decided to expand the ferry routes. The opening of closed wharves is currently being planned. It is also learned that the amount of coal used for ferries is very large, and a request is being made to the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Bureau Handles Securities Registration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance began collecting temporary income tax on securities transactions on the 7th of this month and has entrusted the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange to forward securities transaction certificates to various brokers for collection. It is understood that the bureau has ordered various brokers to urge securities holders, whether corporate bonds, government bonds, or stocks, to go to the bureau to complete supplementary registration within one month. Those who fail to complete supplementary registration within the time limit or who do not have a transaction certificate will be absolutely prohibited from trading in the market.</p>
<h3>Cotton Control Committee Plans to Register Yarn Factories</h3>
<p>The Cotton Control Committee, in order to strengthen control work and unify the management of yarn factories, is actively preparing to handle the registration procedures for major yarn factories. It is understood that the registration date will likely begin in the near future. The registration form is currently being rushed into production, and its contents are quite detailed. In addition to the registration form, there is also an appendix. It is said that this move by the committee is of great significance.</p>
<h3>Scope of Miscellaneous Grain Association Reduced</h3>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai District Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association yesterday, the association has completed its reorganization, which was mandated by order. After the reorganization, its scope will be reduced, and its name will be changed to the Shanghai Municipal Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association. A short-term committee will be established first, and the candidates for the preparatory committee have already been submitted to the Municipal Economic Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops to Close Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The 14th of this month is the traditional Dragon Boat Festival. All banks and money shops in the city will hold a summer holiday on this day in accordance with the holiday schedule stipulated by the joint meeting of the banking and money industry. The industry associations, clearinghouses, bill exchange offices, money reserve depots, and money market will also be closed at the same time, suspending business. All exchanges and settlements due by colleagues and customers will be completed the next day. In addition, the Zhongqiao Mud Company, Postal Savings Bureau, Foreign Banks Association, major foreign banks, and various securities exchange markets will also be closed for one day on this day. It is understood that the banking and money industry has made fewer loans to the public during this year's summer festival. 80% are fixed-term loans, so banks and money shops are opening as usual. Because merchants, companies, and factories have many dealings with customers and colleagues, they mostly handle external settlements before this summer festival. The situation in various industries has been quite busy in the last two days.</p>
<h3>Middle Eastern Nationalities Adopt Independent and Autonomous Policies</h3>
<p>Statement by Director Matsudaira</p>
<p>The regular press conference hosted by the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy was held yesterday (the 12th) at 3:00 PM. Director of Information Matsudaira delivered a speech on the issue of British and American troop withdrawals from the Arab countries of the Middle East. He stated that the reason why Britain and the United States sent troops to the Arab countries of the Middle East in the past was because Germany was advancing in the Balkans, and Britain and the United States feared that German troops would advance into Turkey, Egypt, Arabia, Iran, and other regions. In order to counter the German troops, they had no choice but to send troops to these areas. Now that the European war has come to an end, the withdrawal of British and American troops is inevitable. However, to date, Britain and the United States have not yet implemented the withdrawal of troops, and the French and De Gaulle governments are deeply afraid that the old French influence in Syria and Lebanon will be seized by British forces. They have increased the number of French troops stationed in Syria, Lebanon, and other places, willing to cause friction between Arabs and French. Subsequently, the Iranian government also formally requested the withdrawal of troops from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the independence of the Arabs in the Middle East has been deepened by the occurrence of these two incidents, forcing Britain and the United States to reconsider the Middle East issue. Given the above situation, countries such as Iraq and Egypt have also adopted the same request, launching public opinion to demand the withdrawal of British and American troops. It can be seen that the lessons of this war will definitely make the various nationalities in this area adopt independent and autonomous policies.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Xiantian Dao (Continued from Page 1)</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Promotes Pacification Work</p>
<p>The provincial government, realizing that the situation had become unbearable, ordered the Wuxi-Jiangyin authorities to intensify pacification work. If the Xiantian Dao followers did not submit to pacification, did not surrender weapons, and took any further action of resistance by May 20, measures of extermination would be taken. A regiment headquarters was also established, and Yang Yanbin was appointed as the commander. Mr. Yang left for Zhangdai on May 29 to assess the situation. The work is still being carried out. When reporters traveled from Wuxi to Jiangyin, they saw many Qing and Zheng soldiers stationed along the highway. In the past, Xiantian Dao members carrying weapons frequented the roads along the Wuxi-Jiangyin highway, but this is no longer the case.</p>
<p>Green Jiang Provincial Government Proclamation: (Cultivate the fields, provide for the needy, be filial to parents, love the country and your home, pay taxes, obey the law, respect officials, follow the right path, overthrow cults, learn to read, live and work in peace, gathering in crowds is not allowed by the law of the state, violating the criminal law will harm your wives and children. May my brothers remember these words.)</p>
<p>Excerpt of Wuxi Government Proclamation: (May the followers of the Xiantian Dao know that we have gone through many deliberations. The deadline is May 20th, do not forget the last chance. Time is running out, we reiterate the three chapters of the order: First, surrender your weapons, do not abandon your livelihood or hide them. Second, prohibit gatherings, immediately disband the crowds in all four directions. Third, do not wash your hair, each of you should stay in your own land and keep to the reins. If you can practice all of these prohibitions, the other aspects can be understood. The crucial moment has arrived, please do not be reckless. You must know that the rule of law has no exceptions, the original intention is to eliminate evil and ensure the safety of the good people. Inform the people of the strict elimination of the disaster, so that you do not disturb the villagers. The government will solve the supply of all military and police forces, and has issued a general order to secure the people and not harm the people. From now on, live in peace and happiness, and do not spread rumors. Your fathers have issued a decree, and stop your actions as soon as possible. If you continue to be stubborn and uncooperative, a large-scale suppression will occur. At that time, it will be too late to regret, and your family will bring about their own destruction.)</p>
<p>Xiantian Dao Representatives Detained in Wuxi</p>
<p>During the period, on May 6th, twelve representatives from various districts of the Xiantian Dao, including Ni Yucai, and Zhang Zhixian, a consultant from the Xiantian Dao General Assembly in Beijing, felt that the situation was serious and deeply concerned. They stepped up their activities and held a banquet that day. The relevant authorities deemed it necessary to detain them, and together with the authorities, arrested all thirteen Dao members and detained them in the security team, awaiting disposition by the provincial government. When reporters visited the Wuxi government, they had detailed talks with Ni Yucai and Zhang Qingguang.</p>
<p>Golden Light Magic Proves False</p>
<p>If it were not for the public trial of the Golden Light Magic in Wuxi on May 18th, I am afraid that the Xiantian Dao's influence would not have been quelled so quickly. It turns out that after Ni Yucai and the other thirteen people were detained, dozens of people, including Yi and Bingmingdu, saw that the Xiantian Dao had lost its leaders. At the same time, seeing that the Xiantian Dao had extensive power and could be exploited, they entered the three districts and two counties, falsely claiming that the Golden Light Magic was sent from Beijing, and that its magic was more profound than the original Xiantian Dao. Those who practiced it had to cut themselves with a knife ninety-nine eighty-one times, and falsely claimed that by chanting one (Liao) and waving the other hand in the air, they could make a stone fall from the sky. The villagers, who had already been deceived by the demonic teachings, were worried about losing their leaders. Suddenly, such an even more brilliant Dao master came to help them, which was really too difficult to come by. Of course, they deeply believed in it and treated him like the above. Therefore, in less than half a month, the number of Daoists and the depth of their superstition were indeed excessive.</p>
<p>This group of Jiang Mingbo, in order to wantonly publicize their power, and make the authorities believe in their so-called fabricated demon magic, actually conceived an unrealistic plan. They did not fear death, and made a desperate gamble. In mid-May, they repeatedly requested the Wuxi Sun government, claiming that the Dao's method of being invulnerable to knives and guns was indeed true, and they were willing to come to the county for a public trial. The authorities initially dissuaded them, but they were willing to reduce the tearing, and at the same time, the people were so deeply affected by it that the future was very weary. If the test was not carried out, it would not be enough to wake up the people. On May 18, the government notified the military and police along the way and allowed them to come to the city.</p>
<p>On that day, Jiang Mingbo brought dozens of proud Dao followers and requested to conduct the trial at Tianguanlun. The location was near the Luosheqiao bridgehead guard team. At that time, there were more than 20,000 spectators. During the trial, Jiang Mingbo arbitrarily designated five Dao followers with white cloths on their heads and black secret buttons. He announced more than 300 meters away, and when the bell rang three times, Jiang and others completed their performance and verified what they called (equal division of the crowd). They tried to flash away, but the soldiers were already in place, and in a month, the soldiers arrested Jiang and the other six people. The so-called (invulnerability to knives and guns) was also revealed to the public.</p>
<p>Since then, the Luo family has made a very strong effort. The general public has also been attacking such events. They felt that the (golden light magic) teachers (one step higher) were still acting as if they did not want to. Therefore, they were immediately indifferent to the evil doctrines of the Xiantian Dao, fearing that the authorities would impose a persuasion attack. They have handed over the knives and guns voluntarily, and the power of the Xiantian Dao has suddenly been reduced by more than half. Although some have other intentions, they want to make a final struggle, saying that the day test was invalid, because the Zheng Yin star was highly dangerous (said the various long officials) and there were unclean things. In fact, although the long is stupid, he has already lost his faith, unless his power is treated, and it is impossible to escape.</p>
<p>Now there are remnants of the Xiantian Dao in the remote areas of Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Chushan, but their power is no longer great, and it is only for self-defense. The local government authorities (with military and police supplies, the government has a solution, and has issued a general order for inspection, securing the people and not harming the people), if this can be done, what the people expect is only this, it is predicted that in the near future, without using force, all the remnants of the Xiantian Dao will be self-destructive.
