<p>親愛的馬歇爾特使：我們是那樣焦慮的節待着您，爲了我們祖國的前途，爲了整個世界和平的保障，等待着您來消弭和平的陰影與勝利的危機。常我們聽見了赫大使的辭職消息，我們是感覺到非常驚奇，甚至詫異美國外交政策，將會轉移。接着又得悉將軍出任駐華特使的報道，這使我們把瞬息間對美國的懷疑，完全消失，同時增强了我們的信心。因爲每個中國人，深信特使必將以指揮作戰完成勝利的決意，來主持正義，解除現階段的一切困難。我們要歡呼，歡呼神聖底抗戰已獲得了全面的勝利，歡呼反侵略者確實把握了勝利之果實。戰爭的過程中，我國的力量，已對侵略者愚蠢的忽視作了一個有力的答覆與論據，在穩定這動盪不安的局勢裏，有着不可忽略的因素，過去的事實，告訴我們小小的導火綫，會發生極大的後果，現在的中國不是八年前的中國了，尤其是現階段的中國。馬特使，我們希望您注意而深切的瞭解，以您以往愛護中國的熱沈，來帮助我們。過去的八年中，中國的百姓，遭受了空前的浩刦，顚沛流離的人，都希望回家，安靜地過和平生活。可是他們失望了，他們的心願變成泡影。報上帶來的只是悽慘的消息，津浦平綏鐵路，悉遭共軍破壞，阻礙受收工作，不顧人民死活。共軍侵製綏東，抗戰雖已勝利，人民仍遭浩刦。我們反對一切戰爭，戰爭已使我們精疲力盡，我們要求安靜，我們要過和平的生活。勝利來臨的今日，我們又窺見了分裂的徵象，這是何等疼心的事。共產黨的不合作主義，與割據政策，造成了中國的騷擾，這騷擾妨礙着我國的統一，把勝利蒙上了一層灰色，使我們感到祖國前途的可悲。美國是我們忠實的朋友，在擊滅侵略與不民主的戰爭中，始終帮助我們，我們也以最大的信心，相信我們的友人，一定能協助我們完成和平統一。最後，我們要求馬歇爾特使，籲請美國政府，理解中國目前處境，援助中央政府，建設民主目由富强的新中國，確立世界永久的和平基礎，完成至高至美的大同理想。親愛的馬歇爾特使，我們謹以熟忱致無限的敬愛，並祝馬歇爾特使康健！（中央社）</p>

<h3>內政農林兩部特派員　離淪飛平轉長春　中蘇軍隊聯絡事宜獲進步</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶二十日電〕內政部東北特派員馬博庵，農林部特派員孫宗翰等一行，二十日飛平轉長春。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平二十日電〕聖誕節將屆，而東九省又復籠罩於神秘及些微悲觀之中，中國報紙又提及中·蘇談判之微妙關係，國軍候令開入瀋陽，長春，哈爾濱，目前正不免徒勞盼望。蔣經國定二十一日再赴再春，中國軍事代表處主任董彥平，十八日在長春與蘇聯參謀長會議兩小時後，對於東九省中蘇軍隊聯絡事宜已稍獲進步，日內將再開會議一次，但似無迅速解次之望。東北領土問題解次後，中國欲恢復東省經濟使能自立，前途亦困難重重。日本佔領東北後，曾發行偽幣五十萬萬元，物價指數因此增加七十倍，本年七月，日人知已戰敗，復加發僞鈔三十萬萬元，並預發政府要人俸給兩年，備購「必需品」。因此物價指數又增三十倍。</p>

<h3>莫斯科會議第五日　三外長接觸頻繁　遠東時局顯爲談話主題之一史達林曾延見英美兩國代表</h3>
<p>〔路透社英斯科二十日電〕英外相貝文，美國務卿貝爾納斯，昨曾分別竭見史達林元師，此乃史達林自黑海沿岸之索基歸來後之第一件公事。員文晤史達林時，英外交部常務次官賈德幹爵士及駐蘇大使寇爾爵士隨同覲見。貝爾納斯則携駐蘇大使哈立曼　通譯官二人同往。哈立曼事後聲稱：「史達林精神殊佳，較余在本年十月赴索基晤見時允好」。三強外長今日將舉行第五次會議，談話情形仍嚴守秘密，惟蘇聯報紙則有對日本·中國·及越南之情形，表示不滿者，由此亦可想見遠東局勢確爲三强談話主題之一。蘇報對於日本問題，似主張由具有太平洋方面利益之各主要國家共同管治。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕官方雖尚未證實，然倫敦及莫斯科一般觀察家，咸認西班牙問題必爲三强外長會議議程之一，希望三强能決定對弗朗哥政府採取一致之政策，使法國亦得加入。同時莫斯科會議仍爲秘密空氣所籠罩但見三國外長接觸頻繁，而各國專家顧問，亦呈異常忙碌之狀態，會議之緊張，於此可以想見。</p>
<p>我駐蘇大使　訪晤英美兩外長</p>

<h3>美出席聯合國會　代表團陣容　羅斯福夫人亦列入在內籌備委會討論托治問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十九日電〕杜魯門今日提請任命下列四人爲聯合國大會美國代表：羅斯福夫人·參院外委會主席康納利·參議員范宣堡·及前國務卿斯蒂丁紐斯。總統復提請任命斯蒂丁紐斯爲聯合國理事會之美國代表，受大使銜。總統及國務卿缺席時，渠爲聯合國最高美國代表。杜魯門復宣佈國務卿貝爾納斯將出席下月聯合國首次會議，而爲美國高級代表。</p>
<p>又合衆社電，杜魯門提請任命下列五人爲聯合國美國候補代表，衆院外委會主席白魯姆·衆議員伊登湯生·前郵務總長華克·及紐約律師杜勒斯（即共和黨上屆總統候選人杜威之外交顧問）。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕美國全面參加聯合國機構案，已由參衆兩院先後通過。兩院所通過之法案，內容稍有出入，即組織共同委員會加以調整，完成整個法案，並已於半小時內由兩院表示無異議通過。該法案現已送達杜魯門總統簽署施行。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十九日電〕今日聯合國機構　委會在此間開會時，蘇聯與菲律濱對擁有殖民地各國所持之爭議，結果前兩者獲勝，決定授權聯合國託管理事會，在殖民地本土上選舉殖民地各民族之發言人。此種選舉並非委任性質者，但理事會此項手續之新規定，係承認此一原則。美國英國南菲聯邦與中國投票反對此項建議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十日電〕聯合國機構籌委會美國代表團原曾主張國際聯盟代管領土移交聯合國託管委員會時，各有關係各國應享平等權利。今日開會時，美國代表團表示放棄此項原案，而主張由聯合國全體大會通知代管各國，請其與其他直接有關係各國採取同一行動，將其代管領土交與聯合國機橫管理。似此，則將來對論巴勒斯坦，及澳洲與紐西蘭代管太平洋各島時，美國及其他無代管領土之國，勢將處於次要地位。美國以爲上項辦法，並不影響其對百本代管各島之地位，因此項領土可被視爲與「敵國脫離」之領土，各大國對之負有重大責任。此外，英國代表主張聯合國機構永久會址，應設在美國東部一小城之中。印度代表提出在聯合國機構所在地，不應有被視黑之種種限制，英代表對此表示贊同。</p>

<h3>對荷印及英暹談判　艾克遜發表聲明　希望各方重新努力獲得和解要求英暹暫緩簽訂任何協定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜今日接見記者，談荷屬東印局勢，是爲美國務院首次聲明對荷印問題所取政策。艾克遜宣稱：美國對荷印情勢日益關切，希望各方重新努力獲得和解。荷印問題獲得協定，其主要責任應由荷蘭及獨立軍領袖共同負擔。足以影響世界之重大問題，其能和解與否，美國對之，不能不深切注意。美國唯一希望，即東印度問題能和平解決，俾對促進世界安全繁榮及增進人民幸福有所裨助。各方唯有以現實的寬容的及合作的態度進行談判，始能獲得解決，而由和平途徑消弭異見。艾克遜復鄭重宣稱，美國對東南亞洲所發生事件，有相當關係，並已請求英國及暹羅延期進行和平談判。相信美國雖未能直接參加談判，但應有事先向英國表示意見之充分機會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕副國務卿又克遜今日宣布：美國已要求英國與暹羅，在英美談判就緒前，暫緩簽訂任何協定。美國已屢次提出此項要求，某次英國與暹羅似將正式簽訂停戰協定，美國亦曾要求暫緩。美國方面理由有二：即（一）美國與暹羅邦交素睦，暹羅樹立獨立民主政府之願望，美國允表同情。（二）美國對日作戰，費力甚大，美國對於遠東全部之和平與安街，具有重大關切。美國對於英暹談判之發展常接報告，最近則因氣候關係，消息中斷。此間英官方以爲英暹協定在下星期內可望簽字。</p>
<p>英暹條約即將公佈</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕每日電聞報外交訪員今日稱：關於英國與暹邏間和平條件之協定，可望於聖誕節公佈。衆信條件包括下列各點：暹邏應付還境全部盟軍之給養費用，賠償日方佔領時英方產業所受一切損失，食米柚木及橡皮等商品之出口與生產，應受盟軍當局節制。至世界不復缺少此等產物爲止。該訪員又稱：美代理國務卿艾契森昨在華盛頓所發之言，頗令倫敦官方人士大惑不解。據傳艾氏謂美政府已請英暹於「對美討論進行時」弗締結任何協定，並稱美國對暹邏局勢有確切之利書關係，但聞關於暹邏並未與美國進行討論，英國對暹談判情形，曾詳細通知美國，衆信美國對此已表贊同。</p>

<h3>近衛回憶錄記述　大戰之因果　日皇未壓制主戰派以致終致釀成大禍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿日電〕近衛文　自殺後所遣回憶錄，曾有下列記載。博稱日本軍閥主戰派除日皇本人外，無有能使若請就範者，惜日皇亦未出以積極行動，致終釀成大禍。太平洋戰事爆發前，美日兩國方努力進行和平談判，其時日本海陸軍當局甚至連外交界均深覺日皇係抱完全不千涉態度。日皇衷心希望和平雖屬毫無疑問，但彼未有積極行動以便和平實現。近衛對其第二及第三次組閣失敗，並未自加責備反指斥日本政禮不應讓日本陸軍任意行動，似與日本政府其他各部完全脫離關係。當日本政　在　其全力與美國談判之際，日本軍人反而積極備戰，一若談判業經失敗者然。不僅如此，日本內閣甚且對當時軍人所作凖備究爲如何，亦茫無所知，而日本軍艦調動頻繁，海陸軍已入動員狀態，時美國方與日本進行談判，獲悉日本備戰情形後，漸對日本發生懷疑以爲日本並無企求和平之誠意。一九四一年九月，美日關係最顯緊張，是爲日本必須決定和戰關鍵，日皇之弟東久邇宮主張採取緩和政策，曾稱：除日皇果斷外，別無善策。按日本陸軍或認和平談判必成泡影，思欲一戰。海軍雖亦深恐戰敗，但不願公然主和，與陸軍反對。日本宮內大臣木戶侯爵曾告聯合社記者貝萊斯謂，日皇常時不致反對陸軍主張。惟據吾人觀察，如日　果眞命令陸軍停止備戰，戰事未始不可避免。近衛回憶中稱，彼曾數次親聞日皇告知東久邇，謂日本陸軍行爲誠屬令人遺憾，且曾向近衛作同樣表示。近衛又言：東久　曾向彼質問日皇，對大局何以漠不關心，如認局勢惡劣何不挺身而出，將惡劣情形，公開宣佈，近衛思向東久邇加以解釋，謂日皇很少發表意見，人或疑心日　未免遇事猶豫。日本重臣西園寺公曾對日皇發生相當影響，以致日皇竟有意將其個人地位，造成與英國國王相同。西園寺等曾勸日皇，謂非在絕對必要之時，切勿居於主動地位，因日皇下令組閣時，除對下列三事特別强調外，未有任何其他指示，即：（一）尊重日本憲法，（二）外交方面勿太堅持，（三）財政界勿引起劇烈更動。近衛辯稱：日本憲法與英國憲法稍有不同，即日本憲法係以日皇個人統治爲其中心，尤其在軍事方面，日本政府對軍人竟無發言餘地，只有日皇一人，可以同時管理日本政府及軍人。日皇在平時固可遇事保守，惟在國家和戰關頭，日皇此種消極態度，足陷國家於極度困難境地，近衛對日皇最後下如此斷語：「日皇態度失之消極，但其本心却始終願維持和平。彼希望並曾企圖阻使日本陷入勝負難卜之任何大戰」云。</p>
<h3>美國會領袖贊成　合併海陸軍　海軍方面表反對</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十日電〕美國會內領袖已同意考慮杜魯門總統於來年初合併陸海軍之建議，但信事先將有激烈辯論。兩院海軍委員會委員反對最烈，僉以陸軍方面將併吞數量較小之海軍，使之成爲一次要之單位。衆院海委會主席文生氏名此計劃爲「武力政治之恐嚇表示」，渠云：「茍此項計劃係由盟邦民主國所介紹，則我人將以疑惑及恐懼之目光視之矣」。文生氏繼謂：此項計劃「將使海軍沉諸海底」云。</p>
<h3>美國鐵路年底起　採用無綫電　使火車車輛互通訊息以增加安全節省時間</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕美國鐵路將自本月卅一日起，採用無綫電使火車車輛互通訊息，以增加安全，節省時間。　此項「鐵路無綫電」係美國聯邦交通委員會所主持設立。據該委員會稱：此舉足以防止意外事件，增加車行效率。深信美國火車將普遍應用，請求試用而加以核准者，已有一百二十九起。</p>
<p>鐵路上試騐無綫電，賺讓有年所，但直至戰時，始在數　及性質上，大見增加。蓋戰事使無綫電機件，由脆弱變爲堅强，在戰車飛機及水陸兩用艇上旣使用放功，足見火車之振盪，亦可無礙。</p>
<p>美國鐵路協會宣稱：無綫電裝置明年　未能普遍使用，因訓練無綫電報務員以及機件之定購裝配，均須假以時日。無綫電何以能增加行車安全，請觀下舉諸例：</p>
<p>（一）甲車某車箱內冒烟，爲路過之乙車所見，則藉兩車間之通話，可立即由乙車車員通知甲車機師，車音雖鬧，亦於機師無礙，因用擴音器可藉手提無綫電話機即刻召到所需人員。</p>
<p>（二）管車人在長達一哩之貨車上，見中間車上有物將　，或其他危險情形，即可藉車輛間之通話，令機師停車。此舉可避免使用車後制動機，因在引擎未停時，使用此機，往往有使車分裂爲二之危險。又當長車倒開時，引擎間與車尾允有通話必要。</p>
<p>（三）在荒僻地方發生意外事件，欲打電話，須至幾哩路外。裝有無綫電之火車，可立即發出求援信號。一九四三年曾有火車傾覆，車昌步行三哩方獲電話請援。此外無綫電更有增加車行連率之利，司車員可藉無綫電在軌道轉換處發令開東，管制動機者亦不必探首車外，冒寒與機師交談。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京二十日電〕皇宮衛隊五十名今日罷工，其餘五百五十名亦以罷工相威脅，要求裁退主要官吏及採取其他民治化措置。此種空前局勢，已使內廷官吏驚慌失措不知如何交代日皇。</p>
<p>〔甲央社東京二十日電〕日首相幣原本日表示，渠及渠所領導之內閣將不辭職。幣原稱，渠聽從民意，人民如欲其辭職，渠始辭職。政治觀察家認爲幣原之聲明，表示渠並欲保持且前地位，直至渠於明年一月最後一週大選時被迫下台爲止。</p>
<h3>日政府擬減少　人民食糧配給</h3>
<p>勢將引起嚴重反響</p>
<p>〔中央社東京二十日電〕日本政府頃需減少其食糧配給，因農人拒絕將本屆秋收遞交政府之故。至十二月份爲止，農夫接受命令，按照市塲價格售與政府之食米，僅達總數之百分之十一。明年二月間，日本將遭遇嚴重之米荒，政府迫於情勢，將於正月中旬減少人民之糧食配給，然而政府當局此種措置，勢將引起一般人民之急烈反響，尤以市區人民爲然。</p>

<h3>江南一角的「小上海」　無錫的新生姿態</h3>
<p>— 本報記者·蒼龍</p>
<p>無錫—這江南區裏的「小上海」。自從第三方而眾總司令部　來後，更增加了它在京滬綫上舉足輕重的地位。此番第三方面軍新聞聯絡組，以京滬衛戌區綏靖工作督導團出發工作在即，特地邀請上海記者團來錫，參加配合該團各組報導工作。記者出發的動議，在臨行的前夕才決定的，一切都顯得匆迫無準備，在錫匆匆逗留了兩整天，雖說時間是那末的侷促，可是對無錫一般的輪廓，還不能說是十分的模糊。</p>
<p>抵錫的當夕，在湯司令宴督導團工作人員的酒席上，聽到了他對恢復地方秩序，組織民衆武力的一番決意。他說明了勵行保甲制度的需要，他對各地方請求發給槍械，以便自衛之請，也表示同感，不過要儘量鼓勵建築碉堡，善良地運用這些槍械。他最後還一再的勉勵各工作人員，說要抱中央的德意，來宣慰民衆，萬萬不能增加人民的負担，而一切的措施，亦求無遠政府與人民的需求。第二天的中午，在孫團長元良的餐席上，又聽到了關於督導團組織和工作的情形，曉得督導團是一個黨政軍的集體組織，對京滬衛戌區內各部隊及各地方黨政機關，都有視察督導之職，目的在增進綏靖工作的效率。預計視察督導的工作時間，大致要延長到兩三個月。參加督導團的各報記者們，除報道督導地區內的新聞外，也得要負起一部份視察督導的使命。工作是艱辛的，職責是重大的，可是兩三個月之後，當那動蕩離亂了多年的江南，重行結起安謐之果實的時候，我們又將怎樣痛快地額手相慶呢？</p>
<p>讓人民透氣　苦了柴米縣長</p>
<p>光復區自田賦暫告豁免後，而中央一時尚不能補助前，各地方政府都普遍的鬧着財政恐慌，無錫當然也不能例外。據范縣長告訴我：縣政府目下稅入，只有娛樂，屠宰，牌照，和房捐四項，收入不足支出十分之一，可是他却不願向鄉區人民徵借。他說：鄉區人民在過去同時有五六種負担，現在好容易從八年的苦海中，鬆下了一口氣，實在不願就施微借，他認爲唯有减輕老百姓的負担，才能把民心爭奪回來。所以結果向城區商會籌借了三千五百萬元，暫時彌補一下。可是單就維持縣政府所屬各部門五千餘工作人員，就覺得左支右絀了，再加縣保安隊六百多個兄弟，因爲天時驟寒，要急待添置一批棉制服，一下子就要四千餘萬元的支出，實在難於籌集。他慨然的說：他簡直是個柴米油鹽的縣長！</p>
<p>除此之外，他感到另一種的困難，有幹部缺乏和法令不全兩點。他說：戰爭延長了八年之久，幹部人才散失殆盡，有些都帶上了僞氣，有些眞才良謀，却因地方治安未定，不敢貿然出來，很使他有獨木難支之感，再加法令的不全，使許多施政措置，都失却了根據。可是我想：建國的前程是艱辛的，「多難」可以「興邦」，「多難」也未始不是建設大無錫的第一步。范縣長說得好，縣政府目前唯一的施政，在如何使民衆安居樂業，生活安定，一切其他的措施和計劃，都是附帶的。</p>
<p>惠山看日俘　消滅民主之癌</p>
<p>十七日的下午，在西北風的怒吼中，我們一行參觀惠山日俘集中營。這裏所集中的日俘，都是屬於日軍第二十七師團的，師團的主腦—落合甚九郞中將—却遠住在記山頂上的一座荒廟裏。我們沿着泥徑拾級而上，一路都是望不盡的墳塚，那廟就在羣塚的峯顚，踏進了落合中將的居室，觸眼看見的是壁架上幾瓶洋酒和一些名貴的紙烟。他安謐地坐在籐椅上，記者們却團團的圍站在他面前，問題像聯珠似的向他發射，他却若無其事答非所問的敷衍了一番，接着又說了一番感謝中國方面對他們寬大的濫調。這千篇一律的感謝寬大，我簡直聽厭了，難道裝在這一度出任「興亞院華中聯絡部部長」「少壯派」「中國通」的落合中將腦袋裏的，就祗這些簡短的濫調麽？我茫然了。我深深地體味到日本軍國民敎育對他們軍人思想統制的成功。統制！統制！這可怕的民主之癌，我們應該徹底的把它剷除，我們應該改造日本軍人的頸腦。</p>
<p>再到惠山日俘集中營，時間將近五點，據說這裏的日俘共有一萬七千多人，當時是日本著名精銳的師團。我們進營參觀時，十九都已擁被高臥，據說每個日俘，一天可配給食米的七百格來姆，與中國士兵的配給量差不多，參觀他們的糧食倉庫時，看見堆存的食米，小麥，和雜糧之類，也還有相當的數量。</p>
<p>參觀各報社　木刻特別精緻</p>
<p>這次因爲是上海記者集團的訪問，所以又忙了無錫新聞界招待設宴一番。無錫的新聞界，目前日報有「大錫報」，「江蘇民報」，「大風報」三家。晚報有「無錫晚報」一家。此外，還有一家頗具歷史的錫山通訊社。在籌備中的有「陣中日報」和「梁溪日報」兩家。所有抗戰前發行之「人報」，「新聞彙報」等，亦有復刋之說。以一個人口不過百萬左右的城市，有如許報紙的刋行，情形不能不說是相省的蓬勃了，各報館我們都去參觀了一次，自備印刷機的只「江蘇民報」一家。値得欽佩的是刻字的工匠，大號的樣題字，固能刻得體態端正，即一般名人相片，因爲沒有製版的設備，也多利用木刻，居然也能刻得維妙維肖，而成本却遠在製版之下，這些也是物質和設備條件兩皆短絀下可貴的產物。</p>
<p>工廠已復工　烟囱多未冒烟</p>
<p>這次旅錫，因爲來去匆匆，對無錫素負盛名的工廠，未能作一實地的巡禮爲憾，祗從口述耳聞，得到了些片段的槪念。據說，論工廠家數，則已有十之六七是復工了，然而因爲燃料的缺乏，機件的損壞，原料的短絀，各廠的生產量，遠不及戰前十之二三。有些地方更呈顯著矛盾的現象，例如因爲動力成本的關係（上海工業用電每度四十餘元而無錫則需二百四十元），麵粉的產量，上海非但大於無鍋，而且一反以前麵粉由錫運滬的慣例，發生倒流的現象。故除非動力，燃料，原料，獲得根本的解決，無錫輕工業的前途，是難望振作的。　十八日的下午，記者又匆匆踏上歸程，在機輪的蠕動中，探首際望着無錫城外的許多煙囪，有許多沒冒煙，冒煙的也不過是稀淡的幾個，這景象正象徵了無錫的工業界。可是我却憧憬着明春到來後，江南變了一片安凈土，人民都埋頭工作，「安居樂業」，無錫又恢復了它工業的全盛姿態，每個煙囱裏都冒着濃郁的黑煙，不再是一個只願追隨的「小上海」，而是一個獨當一面的「大無錫」。</p>
<h3>台灣第二大城　高雄在瓦礫中重建</h3>
<p>— 合衆社通訊員不霍愛德</p>
<p>台灣第二大城高雄，遭美機爆裂彈及燒夷彈的轟炸，全城已十分之八被毀，這幾天，該城市民正背着鐘鍬畚箕，在淸除這一片瓦礫。</p>
<p>學校的敎師，學生，與普通工人一樣，並着肩在市長的指揮下工作，他們塡沒了炸彈洞，掃去了瓦礫堆後，工程隊就把聳立着的危牆破橡，二炸平。這樣，高雄就像一片軍原，因爲全城四萬幢房屋，已毀去了三萬二千頓了。</p>
<p>先前美機的轟炸，高雄在物質上固然受損，但經濟上牠也同時遭到了破壞。雖說，自本年一月起，每天的轟炸中，台民死傷祗五百左右，但店舖多毀一家，食物就一天難買一天了。日軍投降以前當地物價急遽上昇，華軍進駐後，日方的限價機構失效，物價更跳得漫無止境，在五年前，買一磅米祗消十五仙，至今年八月已漲至日圓三元了。在我們看來，三元雖祗是小數目，但台灣普通的工人，每天祗掙日圓一元半或二元。</p>
<p>一片漲價聲</p>
<p>其餘的物價，也跟着米一樣上漲。魚類現在要日圓十六元一磅，五年前祗要一元够了，猪肉每磅從一元漲至卅二元，牛肉每磅從五十仙漲至十元，鷄肉也漲達二十倍。</p>
<p>華軍進駐後，當局想立刻設法解決食物問題。先後曾召集當地領袖開過數次會議，商討避免食物發生嚴重缺乏的各項措施。然而，黑市依然猖獗，物價漲勢仍在進行，允因該島北區方面華幣泛濫，物價就更爲抬高了。</p>
<p>戰爭開始以來，華幣與日圓雖未正式訂定折合率，但一般商人願以日圓一元半兌收關金一元，至於對美金的折合率，當地也沒有規定，但美金一元可兌到華幣一千五百元，再折成日圓一百十二元。這些黑市兌換率，與華軍進駐越南後的情形一樣，常時商業界貿易，祗能用黑市折率，後來盧漢將軍出佈告，才使黑市成爲合法的折合率。</p>
<p>目前，高維的許多商店主，有些已在廢墟裏搭起木棚，將就做着買賣，有些已遷到小鎭或鄉下去，有些就簡直坐着不做生意。</p>
<p>找飯碗去</p>
<p>高雄的工廠，現在仍都停着工，那些工人們，不是走了的都在想法找飯碗。日本人說：食物是一天天缺少了，他們設立的農產試騐所已遭了搶劫，這實在是先前沒有的事。中國當局說，這次搶刧是民衆對日人憎恨鄰視的表現。</p>
<p>華方新市長到任後，第一個措施是禁止商店閉門停業，以安定當地的市面。同時，還下令各學校一律開課，所有開工中的實業工廠，也奉令一律縱續開工。</p>
<p>政治方面，前傳台灣曾發生獨立運動，現在看不出什麼跡象來。據說，這些分子因華軍的進駐已躲起來了，記得在日軍投降前的幾天裏，他們曾領導過示成運動，並煽惑民衆，要求獨立。然而合灣民衆目前在外觀上，並無不滿華軍進駐的跡象。華方接收官員抵合後，曾與調查團就常地的政治情形加以硏究，據陳儀長官的接近者談：他本人雖是個地質化學家，來台研究當地農業的發展情况，但主要任務却在政治。據說，另有華軍情報官一人，也已來台硏究政治情形。</p>
<p>他們兩人在視察高雄某實業工廠時，曾指示各代表：所有日籍高級職員，必須全部遣散，愈快愈好。台灣當地市民，以華人佔最多數，他們大部都要求在台灣省政府裏佔一職位。還有些是以前在日軍管理工廠內任事的職員，他們要求當局把工廠由他們接辦。</p>
<p>中國當局口頭曾屢次說過台灣實業界的日籲高級職員，將分別遣散。這措施如果實行，將產生很嚴重的問題，因爲那些高級職位，都需要績練的專家來據任，中國一時暹沒有這麽多的人才。記得高雄農業試騐所的日籍技術員曾說過，如果不在磯永吉博士的領導下，他們不願留在台灣工作。磯永吉是前任農業試騐所的所長，爲全世界產米學的權戚之一，他已在合灣住了三十五年，將來或許可能被任爲農業部的名譽部長，他自已亦表示如果有機會繼續硏究，他願意留在台灣工作。（本報編譯室特譯稿）</p>
<h3>黑烟衛天砲聲絕響　香港的恐怖回憶　淪陷前後慘痛追述</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>香港，是在一九四一年十二月八日，發生戰事，九龍不到四天，便淪陷了。香港因爲他是海島，四面有水，敵人不容易登陸，所以能够多守衛些時期。可且因爲當地兵力單薄，沒有援軍，也難以保衛。但是英軍上下一心，努力的抗敵，雖然經過了兩次的倭寇和平攻勢，派遣所謂「和平使者」，來港商洽條件，也遭港督嚴辭拒絕，非戰到最後，不肯中止。</p>
<p>七姊妹（英王子道）的幾座火油庫被燒了，黑烟衝天，幾日幾夜沒有停息。赤柱，筲箕灣等地，給倭兵登陸，血戰了幾天，敵軍有增無减，而且逐漸的西進。在九龍方面射擊到香港的大砲，一發就是通續數十響，把史塔士運的汽車道（棧道式的）附近打得七零八落，藍塘道，銅鑼灣一帶，倭兵侵製到了。</p>
<p>砲台不發砲　市面蒙上灰色</p>
<p>我是住在跑爲地的成和道，門口對過十數丈遠，就有臨時安置兩尊曲射砲位，每一發砲，牆壁震動，玻璃窗門簌簌作響。敵機不時在空放下傳單，蠱惑人心。可是在廿四日的一天，市上情形有點變動，防空人員不見了，路上，溝渠裏，空地間，有不少的防空人員及警察的衣帽亂七八糟的丟着，守衛防空洞的服務人員，對住在洞裏的避難者聲明，今晚不再維持秩序了。使一般避難者，個個惴惴不安。因爲地方秩序失了常態，香港方面的砲台也不大發砲了，我的住所門前幾個印度砲兵已把砲撞針拿去，只遣下兩尊砲身，砲彈也搬走了。整個市面，蒙了一層灰色，每一個人的心，驚恐異常，驚恐大禍來臨，苦果就要嘗到了。</p>
<p>果然，在晚上九時左右，倭兵前頭馬隊，已在跑馬地布防，有幾個台灣籍的通譯狐做虎威採，逐家勸諭居民懸掛　藥旗，並强迫寫「歡迎大日本皇軍」字樣，貼在門口。金玉樓菜館的經理給他抓去做響導，到各要人家裏去了。跑馬地接近銅羅灣，所以倭兵先頭部隊就到跑馬地來。</p>
<p>二十五日的早晨，英兵，印度兵，義勇隊等，（防空人員已不見了）向西撤退，倭兵沒有逍擊。的過半個鐘頭，倭兵跟着開入中區，向空中放了幾響步槍，同時，空中有飛機示威，九龍方面的倭寇砲兵陣地，也發了幾十響砲，這樣，香港便陷落在魔手裏　英兵離開砲台時，把各砲的機件，一律炸毀，砲口也澈底弄壞，機關槍，鐵甲車，大砲彈等也弄壞的。他們知道苦難的時期到了，就大喝酒類來刺激神經。</p>
<p>倭兵貼封條　不繳費不啓封</p>
<p>倭兵進入市區後，即把預備好的木板，寫着什麽「軍民政部」或「海軍部」，「陸軍部」，「報道部」等「管理」的木板，到各銀行，大商店，貨倉，機關，學校，醫院，大酒樓，報館，書店，以及大屋宇等，分別釘封條。有許多門口，不只被釘一條，且有釘着幾個部歐的名義的，可見得他們的手忙脚亂，同時，也表示出他們的各爭地盤勢力。因此，後來要啓封的，就要向每一釘木板的部隊接洽繳費，才能够辦理。如果有一個不答應，即使所謂「港督〕批准，也無濟於事　倭兵的指揮不統一，各找利益，互相爭權，可見一斑。香港各公私機關和大建築物，都被佔踞，各馬路的交通要點，布了鐵絲綱，行人往來，一律要受檢查。電車，公共汽車，伴駛了，電燈沒有放光，自來水斷斷續續的來，有些地方水源且斷絕，商店停業，小店也只開一扇門。</p>
<p>倭兵尤其是馬丁（夫）拖了一把刺刀，藉搜查軍火爲名，到各屋宇去騷擾，手錶，自來墨水筆，照相機，手電筒，望遠鏡等，見着即拿，不見，也强迫要把他找出來。港幣的刧取，他們初時還視做不重要。公私汽車一律停在跑馬地和匯豐銀行隔鄰空地，不下數千輛。</p>
<p>婦女們戰戰競競的恐怕倭兵來臨，多化裝來掩飾，有些且用「山枝子」的水塗在面上手上，裝做病人樣子，或改扮男裝，剪短頭髮。有些跑到天主敎堂去，請義大利人保護。那些混血見不敢在路上走，恐怕被誤認是英美籍人，要人集中營。</p>
<p>汪家店的報館被逮禁的脚色，被釋放了，大肆活動，即日復版，向倭軍歌功頌德，恬不知恥。臉盆大敲，是表示遭受倭兵騷擾，呼援的救聲。香港九龍間的交通，當天恢復，但只准倭軍往來。小販只有街頭巷尾賣零星小物，猪牛肉絕市半天。懂得幾句日語的，替人寫招紙，大發其財。</p>
<p>敵懷柔政策　如糖衣砒霜</p>
<p>倭軍發出第一張佈告，採用懷柔政策，想討好華人，用昭和與中華民國的兩個年號發出。且聲明華人是第三者，不是敵人。可是倭軍的騷擾，特務工作人員的活動，是和他的布告相反的，等於糖衣砒丸的毒。</p>
<p>一百元，五百元的港鈔，宣佈暫時市面停用，那就許多人眉頭縐了，而强迫改用「軍票」，軍票與港幣比，是一與二高勞士打樓，香港大酒店，便是他們倭酋活動和住宿的處所。一般所謂香港紳耆，也被逼出來維持地方了。平民階級最苦，因爲工廠早已停工，有些微存款也用光了，不敢在外行走，恐怕被拿去當苦工。因爲戰事發生了十八天，路上沒有人打掃，垃圾堆積，蒼蠅聚滿，穢臭黨大，要找苦力去淸除。還有許多人把抗日的圖書刊物，丟在路上，不敢存留，所以大街小巷，遍地都是穢物。</p>
<p>有些好事的人們說，香港打仗十八天，是天定的。因爲香字就是「一十八日」四字合成，這又類於拆字巧語，順便一說，爲本文結束。</p>
<p>解甲歸田</p>
<p>鬬中的一個日軍，面部洋溢着歡樂的表情，在田間帮家人打稻，但是，你得注意他身上穿的，還是兵役時期的舊車服呢。這大抵是因爲沒有其他服裝可換的原故。自盟軍統帥麥克阿瑟下令解除一切日軍武裝後，這套制服想來也已如武器一樣放下了吧。</p>
<h3>東北工農業　養活四千萬人</h3>
<p>東北有大量的原料，雄偉的電力，發述的鐵路與航綫，都足以支持這個工業的生產。</p>
<p>東北的農業，說起來還是這區域主要的資源，其重要性並不亞於工業。由於中國甫經摧殘，農業猶待振興，東北的農業在今後一兩年間，當較工業尤爲需要。東北農業會經日本大加開發，現在每年能出產麥三百萬噸，大豆約五百萬噸，此外還有大量米，玉蜀黍，小米與高梁。</p>
<p>總括說，東北的工農業，現在養活四千萬人，它的餘力還可能維持三千萬人生活。因此，中國如能善自經營，除了獲得食糧以外，還可能解除人口過剩的困難，中國可能獲得充作發展內地工業基礎的生產品，此外，它可能獲得將來在日本拆卸的若干機器。（新）</p>

<h3>馬歇爾特使抵華以後</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統特使馬歇爾元帥，昨午飛抵上海，中國陸軍總司令前參謀總長伺應欽上將代表政府躬迎之於江灣機塲。下午六時，馬氏經魏德邁將軍之紹介，與滬市　界領袖會晤於華懋飯店，彼此傾談，情感融洽。馬歇爾元帥爲當今美國第一流軍事人才，而對中國則此來有其特殊使命。蔣主席及王外長旣已先後飛蒞首都，其與馬氏會晤，必不在遠。馬歇爾元帥對國際局勢，觀察深刻，中國問題之癥結何在，如何可以達成使命，不負美總統促成中國和平統一之願望，固早已胸有成竹。而吾人站在中國國民立場，今天來歡迎馬歇爾元帥，眞覺旣欣感，又慚愧。不過馬氏下車伊始，就廣事徵詢意見，我們不能不略述所懷，以助其對中國有更進一步之瞭斛，橫在目前中國的局勢，多少與美國建國初期相似。甲午戰爭以來，五十年間，中國人民在國父孫中山先生的領導下，所努力的，就是要建立起一個富强康樂而統一民主的中國。可惜過去三十年來，這建國工作，時時受到日本帝國主義及地方勢力割據的阻礙。中國國民黨繼承國父遺志，出師北伐，完成統一，成立了國民政府，　日本的侵略更急。目前敵寇降伏，正當我們積極建國的時候，偉大的盟邦特派像馬歇爾元帥的使節到中國來，眞使我們想起當美國建國之初，建國理想與美國相伺的法蘭西亦派了一位傑出的軍事政治人物到美國去的往事。我們願馬歇爾元帥來華，在中國人民心中所起的影響，能够像辣斐德在美國人民心理中起的影響一樣。近代的民主政治，在中國是一種新的嘗試，我們需要在民主政治上有經驗而與我們建國理想相同的盟邦協助，尤其需要一位富有民主精神的軍事天才如馬歇爾元帥者的協助。我們於馬氏蒞華以後所希望的，有下列數點：</p>
<p>第一，在杜魯門總統的聲明裏曾指出美國政府及聯合國只承認國民政府爲惟一合法的中國政府。這在中國人民，一向只以國民政府爲惟一合法的政府。故今後各方面的努力，應該不是在削弱這國民政府的權力，而在使它益臻强固；一切努力必以國民政府爲中心，務使各方面都趨向這個中心，使之益形穩定而强化。所請包羅各黨各派的「聯合政府」，其目的將徒然削弱國民政府，思以一種新的機構來代替國民政府。這與一般中國人民的意向相背，乃若干故意曲解杜魯門總統聲明的詭計。國民政府用人，原來並小限於國民黨黨員，儘有小屬於國民黨的人才　內，且衷誠歡迎各黨各派或無黨無派的人物參加。其所以至今還有政治上之糾紛者，就是有若干少數人企圖削弱或推翻國民政府的存在。今杜魯門總統旣發表其聲明於前，其特使馬歇爾元帥又已到華，是一切努力均應向强化國民政府這個方向推進，自小待言。</p>
<p>第二，所謂「民主」，在理想不同的人中所看到的是不同的東西。中國以三民主義爲建國的最高原則，本已包蓄着西方民主政治的精華。其間關於民權的行使，若創制，若複決，都是國父在硏究美國民主政治的遝用後而採取的體制。三民主義產生的過程中得力於美國民主政治的經驗者特多。中美兩國人民在思想上，在行爲上，所有的共同點大概多於任何民族。中國人民對於自由的傳統尊重不亞於美國人民。因爲愛好自由的原故，所以一切集權主義或集體主義，均不爲中國人民所重。中國共產黨在中國之發展，所憑藉者爲武力，而非賴其主義，因爲中國人民的傳統與所謂馬列主義的傳統不相容，這不獨中國人如此看法，第三國際代表越飛來華，與　國父聯合宣言時，早有說明。而中國共產黨自身亦早已說過願爲三民主義而奮鬥，不管眞假，可見共產主義之不能行於中國，已爲衆所周知。因此，我們不能將共產黨的力量估計太高。至少，在中國有四五百萬的天主敎信衆與一百萬的基督敎信衆，他們雖沒有政團的組織，但他們的生活理想是與所謂馬列主義者根本不同的。要之，在中國民主化的過程中，其惟一的手段，不在新的政治嘗試而在三民主義的充分實施。</p>
<p>第三，任何國家不容許有國內有國，及獨立自主軍隊的存在。杜魯門總統在他的聲明中曾指出：『像共產黨軍隊那樣獨立自主軍隊的存在，與中國的統一不相容，且使政治上的統一不可能。』故在建立一個强大統一而民主的中國過程中，其先決條件，誠如紐的時報所說，首在共產黨交出其軍隊。因爲像共產黨那樣獨立自主軍隊存在一天，即他們對國軍的襲擊，一天沒有停過，而中國境內流血事件的發生，也一天不能終化。爲了避免流血，爲了中國統一，爲了民主中國的建設，共產黨軍隊應立即解散改編，這一點，杜魯門總統固有明確的表示，而在中國國民則幾早已成爲定論，允願其及早見諸事實。</p>
<p>我們知道政治協商會議召開尚須有待，而解決軍事問題的三人小組會議，也尚無消息。深願馬歇爾元帥蒞華以後，首先促成此兩會議之早日舉行。</p>

<h3>證券黑市</h3>
<p>— 小回</p>
<p>上月十九日財政部特派員的一紙明令，結束了證劵黑市。</p>
<p>證劵市塲本來是吸引游資，調劑企業金融的吐納機構，不過一黑之後，就不免有藏垢納汚的危險。何况目前流動於市塲的公司股票，公司本身的身份猶成問題，以僞幣爲本位的有價證劵，其折合率更在未定之天。以是而聽任其在市上流通，的確不無於政令經濟都有關碍。</p>
<p>現在黑市已千古了。『蒙主召歸』之前，市上銀根緊迫，黑市拆息，平均均在月息二角以上。『召歸』之後，頭寸立見鬆動，拆息就步步下降，最近已在一角二三分左右。銀根之鬆緊，雖然另具原因，但股市千古，亦未始絕無關係。</p>
<p>千古之前，股市集中在　『只』所謂『熱門股』上，千古而後，游資忽然埀靑於公債。足見游資最怕沒出路，東也不通，西也不通的結果，難免不激出變來。目前囤貨已過了時，股票又沒的弄，正正當當的企業投資尚未『蔚爲風氣』。這些游資，衝來術去，選中了公債，雖然等是黑市，倒也不能不說是椿可喜現象。</p>
<p>不過，黑市尸骨未寒，黑黑市又已誕生。可見事關經濟，不是政治手段所能完全解決的。當前物價對策，以安定幣値爲首着，增加物資之供給爲第二着，其第三着就應導引游資於儲蓄暨正當投資之一途。黑市旣是非法，就該有合法的取而代之。吾則，房間交易可以轉變而爲夾弄交易；夾弄交易亦可以轉變而爲茶樓交易，茶樓交易更可以轉變而爲馬路交易。黑中有黑，法外有法。祇做個粉飾太平，又何濟何補？</p>
<p>證劵業的整理業已開始。整來整去，祗不過整理了一批證券業的從業者。並不能整理及證券業的經營對象——有價證劵。經濟部對於偽幣資本的各股票發行公司，迄無具體的整理辦法。對於證劵交易所的復業改組等等問題，還保持在悶胡蘆中。吾恐瀰漫一時的『空頭心理』過去而後，泛濫市上的游資，眞會激出變來。『不歸於墨，則入於楊。」不可不注意也。</p>

<h3>社會敎育司黃司長談　全國敎育復員工作</h3>
<p>〔由中央社南京十九日電〕全國敎育復員工作，刻正積極進行。頃據敎育部社會敎育司長黃如今談稱：各級教育復員及充實設備等費，全國約爲八百億元，各省敎育復員經費，尙未包括在內。中央爲協助各省迅速復員起見，亦經撥准十一億元，充作本年度緊急需用。後方各校遷校先後程序，敎部前曾有所擬定，惟以交通關係，將來勢難依照預定計劃實施，現後方各大學多準備於明年五六月開始遷還原址，屆時如交通疏暢，或可於下學年度伊始時遷運竣事。至後方各國立中學，原係因戰事影響，臨時設立，現戰事旣經勝利結束，敎部已在原則上有所決定，即除邊疆各校仍暫維原狀外，其餘一律結束，各校員生則依其籍貫及志願，分發各雀立學校攻讀，經費則以分發學生之班數（五十人一班），一併轉移各省之敎育廳備用。現各校正辦理調查登記工作，以爲將來分發之標準。至於各校員生眷屬之旅費則由敎部統籌供給。</p>

<p>〔大華社重慶航訊〕英國營養救濟金，擬在中央大學首先試辦，幷經決定辦法，規定凡屬家境淸寒經濟來源斷絕之同學，得到不欲申請該項救濟金之同學五人證明，即可申請。故連日前往申請登記者，已達六百餘人。而校方則擬將此項救濟金，作一部分自費同學補助之用，惟多數同學以爲此項救濟金，旨在補助中國學生之營養，理應撥作增進全體同學營養之用，如僅補助一部分人，實背盟邦救助之本旨，因此羣起反對，一致主張此項救濟金，應平均分配各膳團全體同學作「打牙祭」之用，刻自治會正爲此事向校方交涉中。</p>
<h3>漢市府設置　代用國民學校</h3>

<h3>美國大學裏面　聽到小兒的哭聲　嗅到煮飯的香味</h3>
<p>〔聯合社美國新港十九日電〕耶魯大學歷史悠久的校舍裹，現在可以聽到小兒的哭聲，嗅到煮飯的香味，似乎平添了一種家庭的氣氛。原來學校裏的計劃，預備讓已經結婚的退伍軍人，回到學校來繼續肄業，而不致打斷他們正常的家庭生活。</p>
<p>退伍軍人携眷同住</p>
<p>這學期開始以後，已經有八十個這樣的退伍軍人，携眷住到學校裏十七所特別改造的寄宿舍，一半以上的人且已有兒女。退伍軍人可以由國家津貼回校復業，原已有法可據，但立法的人沒有想到，現在房屋缺乏，物價高漲，竟到如此地步，所以耶魯大學的意思，就在帮助實行這法。秋季學期開始的時候，有六百個退伍軍人報名入學，一半以上已經結婚。運上學期已入學的算在一起，就有八百個了。大學裏的職員，弄得手足無措，因爲新港的公寓已少有空屋，可以供給退伍歸來的軍人，外州來的學生或他們的眷屬，更不必說了。</p>
<p>房屋恐慌勉渡難關</p>
<p>據校內管理房屋的密勒氏說：「校中這項供應，實在和理想相去太遠，但是在短時間內所能做到的已經盡了校方的心力可以勉强給已經結婚的學生度過今復二年的困難，總得等房屋恐慌解除了才好」。但是，學生方面對於這個計劃極表讚揚，一個主婦說：「做一個軍人的妻子，我已富有經騐。在我丈夫未開拔到外去之前，我總是跟着營房搬東搬西，以便就近照料和他同住。現在到了學校裏，這才第一次可說是我們的家了」。宿舍中各項設備和租金，視建築和房間大小而異。每一家大都各有二三間居室，但廚房和浴室，是兩家合用一個。房租自三十美元至五十五美元不等。</p>
<p>學生津貼不敷支用</p>
<p>最貴的租金只有二家，是獨佔最高一層，有私室四間，一切水電，熱水汀，冰箱以及租用校中傢具，如桌椅書橱床榻被一褥等，都不另取費用。每一個學生月得津貼七十五美元，大家都覺得不敷支用，所以妻子非得出去找一些工作不可，已有孩子的就格外辛苦了。參議院小組委員會，現正在考慮增加十五美元，但即使增加了，大多數家庭還是嫌不够的，因爲伙食二元一天，一個月就需六七十元。這還是照沒有孩子的計算，那麼如何辦法？有一個學生說：「我們只有挪用從前的積蓄，拿戰事公債去抵押，或者竟然去借債了」。曾在歐洲方面充當海軍上尉的艾塞頓說：「我還有兩年才可以得到工程學位，每年得負債八百元至一千元。蘇若現在兩歲半，邁克爾剛十五個月，不要以爲他們不增加我額外的負擔，明春我可以我到一些工作，每月大的有四十元的收入，境况還是很窘迫的。」大家都同意這是困難的求學，但是大家以爲可以勉力度過，而且是値得這樣去做的。</p>

<p>晨友盃籃球甲組開賽以來，已經四週，尚餘一月戰程，唯其中强弱之分，已具端倪，今日首塲協興汕隊會師，兩者俱屬勁旅，汕隊四戰四勝，尚保持常勝紀錄，麾下如陳淸江·馬燦希·林維聰等，俱爲海上第一流選手，全隊合作功夫，又見較勝他隊，而對於該盃賽，亦抱有絕大野心。查協興已賽五塲，四勝而僅一負於華聯，唯最近該隊得華南隊舊部何金貴李瑞雄等來歸，如虎添翼，今日如能調度陣綫得法，汕隊實未許樂觀。總之，此賽對於甲組錦標，具有相當關係。</p>

<h3>民衆的吃飯問題</h3>
<p>— 趙遠柔</p>
<p>從事民敎工作的我，曾親自到民間去訪問歡學。不少人給我們這樣答復：「我一天到晚的下田工作，那裏有功夫讀書呢！」「物價這末高，生活這末難，讀了書，飯不要吃了嗎？不識字，不要緊的，你們先生眞好管閒事！」</p>
<p>其實勞苦民衆，又何嘗不要讀書！何嘗不知道讀書的益處！但是他們沒有這福分，他們必須做苦工，他們的肚子不能打折扣！</p>
<p>我覺得：（一）辦理民衆敎育，不應忘記了民衆的吃飯問題；打破了民衆的飯碗，硬要他們來上課識字，是絕對辦不到的事！（二）敎育是以改善生活爲目的的；我們應該設法改進他們的生活技能，然後再敎民衆識字看報，那才是眞正的民衆敎育。總之，辦理民衆敎育，應從改善民衆生計着手！</p>

<h3>高院昨在看守所　再審淩逆光炎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕漢奸凌光炎於昨日下午二時半在上海監獄高等法院看守所中再度受審，出席審判長計有劉庭長毓桂，林檢察我朋，祝推事宗海，曹推事駿及金書記官國樑</p>
<p>歷任僞職</p>
<p>先由林檢察宣讀起訴要旨謂：被告於二十七年秋季即參加僞府，任「內政部視察」，同年冬任「安徽省政府視察，」二十八年春任「綏靖部秘書」，二十九年秋任「改編陸軍第十師上校參議」，三十年春任「二十旅少將副旅長」，三十一年春任「肅撫軍監軍」，三十三年春任「錫武澄淸鄉指揮部軍法官」，同年夏又任「第二軍上校參議」，綜合被告參加偽府，迭任軍政各職，達六年之久。雖一再推諉由於敵僞脅迫所致，然決無歷久不能脫離之理由。是故被告實犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一款通謀敵國反叛本國罪。又被告雖向上海憲兵隊自首，然與漢奸自首條例所規定者不符，請貴庭依法重治。</p>
<p>希圖卸罪</p>
<p>當時凌逆光炎在林檢察起訴前，希圖搶先申述理由，爲劉庭長當庭訓斥。嗣凌逆陳述尸供，謂現年三十八歲，江蘇吳江人，早年畢業於持志大學，後留學巴黎，戰前以私人資格赴日本考察商法，曾在上海執敎，抗戰軍興後，在本鄉參加田蚰由部游擊工作，任政治訓練班主任，當時經人告密，以致趨向敵僞，凌逆聲辯彼雖歷任僞職，皆爲環境所迫，但壓次「爲人民造福」，尤其在李逆士羣會同日本海軍陸戰隊在黎里一帶進行淸鄉工作時，曾力阻日軍大屠殺之企圖，並在忠義救國軍退出吳江時之殿後部隊，爲日軍所圍，被告亦盡力使之解圍。當任「二十旅副旅長」時，屢次協助游擊隊工作，故甚爲日軍方面嫉妒，因之而被日本憲兵隊逮捕者多次，備受非人道之酷刑，山此可以證明根本被告無通謀反叛之行爲。並謂於三十二年九月「二十旅」爲日軍全部繳械後，即深知日軍背信無義，凌逆最後要求傳喚在蘇州之證人二名，至三時一刻，劉庭長　傳到證人後定期再審。</p>
<h3>接收日僞船舶　多數須加修理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃向交通部全國船舶關配委員會探悉，我國接收日僞船舶，迄目前爲止，共達二千七百餘艘，最大之船舶，的有四千餘噸，惟多數船舶，機件均告毀換，須待修理後，方可應用。據稱：現由該會調配之船舶，在長江方面計有重慶至宜昌綫二十艘，宜昌至漢口綫二十艘，漢口至上海錢二十六艘，共計六十六艘。至外洋方面船舶之調配，目前仍未固定，聞有數艘駛行東北及台灣等地。</p>
<h3>強迫收買收音機　可聲請發還</h3>
<p>前遭敵僞强迫收買之收音機，及短波收音機，已由敵僞產業處理同查獲保管，業主可持同證件向該處負責方面聲請發還。惟短波收音機之總數約一萬五千具，其中一部分已被運往他處，現正設法追討中。</p>
<h3>嚴查日僑戶籍　發給身份證</h3>
<p>日僑管理處，爲澈查日僑份子起見，業於昨日由憲警會同嚴查集中區內日僑戶籍，共分三十組，同時檢查，限今明兩日檢查竣事，然後發給日　身份證。昨日日僑管理處王兼處長鄒副處長，特分別親赴各處巡視。</p>
<h3>救濟物資　由滬分運各地</h3>
<p>聯合國善後救濟總署運至本埠之糧食衣服及其他供應品，一時曾充塞各碼頭堆棧，現已開始輸人亟待救濟之內地城市及沿海各地。總　最初開來之輪船九艘，曾卸下貨物七萬六千噸，以糧食爲大宗，尚有兩艘正在卸貨中。上述七萬六千噸均已搬出磚頭，除一萬一千噸尚在堆棧外，餘者已分發漢口，天津，秦皇島及九龍等地之分配站。一部份麵粉已在本　發舊與麵包店製麵作零售商及麵粉廠。另又若干售與天津附近之開灤煤礦公司，該公司以麵粉償付工資，已使煤產量增加一倍。將來二星期中將續有二萬噸運出上海，正在與船公司三家商租內河輪船及海船二十艘，以利輸送。總署救濟糧食由十五處區事務所分發，在盛大公用事業中，係免費配給工人，但在食糧缺少而尚有購買力之各地區，則定價出售。售賣所得，將用於直接救濟或遣送難民回鄉。許多外國難民多係猶太人現均獲總署救濟。另有數百人向總署登記，希望藉總將之助遣送回國。</p>
<h3>敵僞產業處理局　第二批發還各工廠　外商二十二家本國二十家</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海區敵偽產萊處理局自接獲行政院批准擴大施政範圍至蘇浙皖三省後。連日由審議委會主委彭學沛，處理局長劉攻芸會商進行辦法，並派秘書了世祺先行赴錫與蘇省府接洽關於常州以東地區之敵僞產業處理事項。至於三省負責人選，尚在審核中，該局對於前敵僞佔據之盟邦及本國廠商，除第一批已發還盟邦二十二家，本國二十四家外，昨經第二十三次審議會議決定第二批發還者，計有三十五處，內屬於盟邦者十五處，計有英商怡和浦東汕廠，怡和紗廠，綸昌印染廠，瑞華鋁鋼精廠，美商中國版紙製品公司，英商恰和洋行機器廠，英商帮斯台洋行，英商義利洋行糖果餅乾製造廠，英商漢中公司，美商兜安氏西藥公司，英商通用電器有限公司，英商怡和公司所屬韜朋路工廠，英商正廣和公司所屬韜朋路汽水廠，英商亞細亞火油公司，英商密豐絨綫廠，英商卜內門洋　公司，屬於本國者，計有中國水泥公司，中國機器冰廠，浦東電綫廠，大同實業公司，無錫織漂印染廠，張錫記鐵工廠，鑄豐搪磁公司，四達橡膠廠，中華染色整煉公司，上海水泥公司龍華廠，中國德興烟公司，大陸橡膠廠，合同烟廠，大德新榨油廠，新民烟公司，公盛總廠，天一味母廠，昆明釀造廠，立德油廠，華豐搪磁公司等二十處。</p>
<h3>漢口日僑戰俘　昨由京運抵滬</h3>
<p>（本報訊）昨晨八時，由招商局接收之日輪「興亞丸」，現改名「江亞」，自京載來集中於漢口方面之日俘日僑一批，計二千一百零五名。內日俘一千七百零一名，日僑二百八十七名，日俘官長七十三名，女看護四十四名。該輪停泊虬江碼頭後，即由戰俘管理處派員押送至江灣某集中地暫住。</p>
<p>關於第二批遣送日俘日僑歸國，因「明優丸」機件損壞而告延遲。昨據戰俘管理處消息，現決定調用日輪「榮豐丸」來滬裝載。該輪已於十八日下午由九洲博多駛出，將先送韓國旅日僑民歸國後，再行駛滬，預定廿四日左右，可以抵達。又悉，此次決定遣送之日俘，爲江灣第十四集中營之花園部隊，女軍屬全體計一千〇七十五名，另日僑一千餘名。</p>

<h3>歡迎馬師速寫　江灣機塲盛况空前</h3>
<p>— 守仁</p>
<p>昨日在江灣飛機塲歡迎美特使馬歇爾將軍，是勝利後罕見的盛大塲面。照預定計劃，馬帥是準定在一時後抵達機塲。美軍新聞聯絡官在上午十一時，就準備了十輪卡車，兩輛以便載送本市新聞記者前往江灣迎候。十一時四十五分，「記者專車」就從福州路出發，滿載了四十多個記者。美軍當局　備甚嚴，臨時又發了記者身份證，無證的一槪不准入塲。沿江灣路就看見新六軍的健兒，持槍佈崗。</p>
<p>包　何總司令</p>
<p>一進機塲，就有戴白色鋼盔的美國憲兵，在機塲各處戒備着。跑道上已停了馬帥坐的黑色大汽車，前面並停了八輛白色憲兵機車，以備在前開道。一時許黑色大汽車一輛駛入機塲，各記者皆知道這是錢市畏的車子，那裏知道首先下車的不是錢市長，而是何應欽德司令。在塲的人，事前沒有得到何總司令抵滬的消息，見了何總司令，大家都有點奇怪。各記者見了何氏，就上前包圍，你也一句，我也一句，提也各種問題，請求答覆。何氏含笑說：「我是軍人，政治問題我不懂得。」何氏對記者却很和悅，有人說：「何總司令對記者有點『美國派』，很受報人的歡迎。」</p>
<p>鏡頭集中了馬師</p>
<p>在塲歡迎的人，士以王曉籟氏來得最晚。他穿了一件黑的大斗蓬，頭上戴着黑的風帽，和在塲的人士談笑得很投機。一時許，各記者就被圈入預定的地位，祗有十個攝影記者，有特權能在圈外工作。有一個外籍記者新從東京來，他說：麥克沃瑟元帥飛抵東京的時候，沒有像昨天歡迎馬帥的偉大塲面。一時四十分，就聽見天空中機聲軋軋，過了幾分鐘，馬帥的銀色專機就發現在上空盤旋。不多一會，就在跑道的盡頭降落了。飛機由吉普車輛前導，徐徐的駛到預定的下機地點。機門一開，馬帥就下來。雖然是六十多歲的人，而他步伐矯健，十足的表現出他是一個軍人。馬帥下了機，美軍樂隊就高奏中美國歌。馬帥和魏德邁將軍，肅然立正行軍禮。這時候，十個攝影記者，十個照像機，同時對馬前進攻，在圈內的新聞記者也忙着找角度，替馬帥攝影。這個歡迎的盛會，連馬帥下機，連奏樂，連檢閱，不過十多分鐘的時間。馬帥與各歡迎人員握手言歡後，即行上車駛去。</p>
<p>鈔票上請簽名</p>
<p>晚上在華懋飯店舉行的鷄尾酒會，到的有四五百人。馬帥和魏德邁將軍，及美代辦勞勃生，軍事參贊貝爾樂上校，馬帥私人秘書雪布萊，站成一排在門口一一和來賓握手。上海的中美領袖，差不多全體出席。馬帥過不多久，就過來和何總司令談了一會，並舉杯互祝康健。在招待會上受記者包圍的有何總司令，和美駐菲列濱德督麥納德。有幾個記者並拿了簇新的鈔票，請何總司令·馬帥·麥納德·及魏德邁簽字，以留紀念。</p>
<p>以馬歇爾元帥這樣一位偉大的軍人，無論對中國，對全世界，都有過重要的貢獻，昨天滬上中外人士的盛大歡迎，眞是異常誠擊，一切出自肺腑。希望中美兩大國的合作，能由馬帥的出任特使而得更進一步的收獲，對全世界的永久和平，獲得更鞏固的保障。</p>
<h3>明年一月中旬起　京滬路增開特快車　增加新式客車及游覽車</h3>
<p>據交通部華中鐵道管理委員會運務處負責人對記者談稱，自美運滬之二十輛機車，與三千輛貨車村料，到達滬市後，即由善後救濟總署撥交交通部支配，京滬滬杭　兩路，當可配得相當數量，對於兩路貨運，大有裨益。近來客運，仍然擁擠，現正積極趕修略有破損之客車車廂，預計明年一月十日左右可增加特別快車一班，自上海至常州或南京，以暢京滬間客運。對於華中各路客運之革新，本會已擬定具體計劃，將增加最新式客車車廂一九一輛，美國最新式游覽車亦在增置之丙，該項游覽車，車廂上半截皆爲玻璃所製，旅客瀏覧四野景物，極爲方便，車中並有空氣調節器之設備，可以調節車廂內溫度，使冷熟適中，增加旅行之愉快。</p>
<h3>蒙難同志會　演劇籌募基金</h3>

<h3>蔡正雅談物價　首須確定匯率</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市物價近日又有迥翔之勢，記者昨特趨訪市府經濟研究室主任蔡正雅，承其分析物價趨勢如下：蔡氏云，日本投降以後，物價漲起之倍數尤較勝利以前爲高。此中因素，諸如僞幣折合率，工廠停工，交通阻梗，行政設施之不善，都爲主因，其後則受美鈔高漲之影響。查美鈔黃金之最高峯爲十一月一日，而日用品之最高峯，則爲十一月廿七日，其後逐步低降，間有盤旋，莫不隨美鈔而高低，而人心之不安，關係亦大。故目下欲求平定物價，首須決定適當之滙率，次須安定人心，若供求偶有不敷，可將敵偽物資平賣，收効必宏，惟須改善平賣之技術問題。倘物價下降，平賣實爲徒勞，須待其蠢動時，迅速大量平售，必可維持預定之水準。允須平賣物品能直入消費者之手，不致流入囤戶，如此則自然因素，亦無問題，物價常無再行暴漲之理。</p>
<h3>購招商局船票　票商須親簽名</h3>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>憶王禮錫</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>一個忠厚，誠懇，熱情，和靄的，巨大的作家，已因服務於抗戰，死去六年了。他看不見勝利，看不見和平，祇能在天上微笑，也許是微慍。</p>
<p>還記得在六年前，全國文藝界抗敵協會週年紀念的晚宴上，我和禮錫及其夫人晶淸同一張桌子，因爲品淸能飮酒，於是我們和盧冀野，取成一條戰錢，和另一桌的洪深大交戰，結果總算我們勝利，可是我也就醉了，恍恍惚惚離開館子，歪歪斜斜在路上蹣珊，要不是有禮錫攙着走，眞不知醉在何處。那種溫和的性情，倒把晶清獲得像男性而他反像女性了。不久我請客，在生生花園和他倆見面。這次錫禮自巳也喝醉了，他爲那嘉陵江的晚景而陶醉。我祗好雇輛車把他拖回去，而晶淸又因事先行，在黝黑的上淸寺路上走着，他告許我最近次意要到前綫去，不願遭受慢性的磨折。他那興奮的背影消逝在本子飛馳哀。</p>
<p>二十八年血底「五三」「五四」激起了每個愛國者的血流底澎湃，誰能再緘默，再容忍呢？於是「作家訪問團」就成立在這血的狂濫裏了！我們年靑的一羣，公推忠厚老練的錫禮來領導。</p>
<p>出發的日期和手續都決定了，可是我的職務不准假，但是他很鼓勵我去，他說「你早說要到前方去的，娥又因病不能同去，你再不去，簡直沒有女的了，你該盡力設法。」</p>
<p>假是無論如何請不准，老舍又認爲我的身體太差，病了豈不累團體，禮錫也注意到這一點，他帶有警告的意味說：</p>
<p>「在前方沒有交通工具就得步行，狂風暴雨也顧不得，這種苦除了健强的人是吃不消的，而且團體的紀律半途又不許退出，該考慮你能受得起？像我導樣的體格，就可以無　啦！」他拍着胸膛，很自負的樣子，並用體恤的眼光看看，這使我可無奈何地向他點點頭，表示服了他的話，並要求時通消息。</p>
<p>我決定不去後，晶淸不贊成，他再三要我去：我知道她的私心，是和我同道，而不致同禮錫分開，可是我終於沒有能去成，晶淸也未能同行。我又回到北溫泉，他倆也就南北分手了。這點錯綜，本來是不負任何責任，但不料不久「錫禮病故」的消息傳來，這就不能不使我引咎自怨了。我差不多天天想，假使我參加訪問團，品淸也同去了，大家在一起，他的病也許得救，即使他仍舊要死，至少品淸可以多和他親近些時日！這樣想，就禁不住流淚，這樣想，就感到一種不安的內疚。然而事實上禮錫再也不會拍着胸說：（他的身子可以無慮的話了。他也永遠不能再回來了。</p>
<p>到現在我還不能相信禮錫是眞的和一切撒手了！他有那樣强壯魁偉的體質，那樣勇敢的靈魂，那樣誠懇和熱情的性格，以及他忠厚的行徑，憑着這些條件，他是死不得的，他也不會死的，我堅信着，一直到現在。</p>
<p>是的，民族的戰士都不會死，尤其是禮錫，他的精神將不朽地活在人們的心裏，活在祖國的歷史上！</p>
<h3>用典與對仗</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>從前提倡文學革命的，有八不主義，不用典故，是其中之一。但以我的見解，用典與吾和文章的本身沒有妨碍，只有用得的當和是否偏僻，使人難以領會而已。如果用得適當的話，對於文章的生動，辭藻簡明等。都有帮助。今摘錄丘倉海（逢甲）送汪頌臣回臺灣的一首古別離行，就可以知道一斑，原詩云：</p>
<p>「惟願君如天上之月，海出復東來：不顯君如東流之水，到海不復回。有情之月無情水，黯然魂銷別而已。况復一家判胡越，百年去鄉里，關門斷雁河絕鯉，萬金不得書一紙，噫嘻乎，嗟哉遠遊子，春風三月戒行李。留不住，簫上聲，拭不減，玉上名。千塵萬刦磨不得，屋梁落月是離情。山中永，出山不復淸；海中月，出水還復明。不惜君遠別，惜君長決絕。知君來不來，看取重圓月。」</p>
<p>這一首詩，只有十三韻。共用典有八，都是異常恰常的，自然的，普通的，而且各有深意寄託的。我們讀了這音　，如果知道丘倉海身世的話，必定覺得他的詩句，感慨至深。因爲丘曾發動台灣民兵抗日的民族英雄而兼愛國詩人。</p>
<p>做文章的用典，如果能在適當，顯豁，自然，普通，寄託，各方面能有其一或五者俱備，那他的文章，勃勃有生氣。吾則瑣碎支離，晦澀而有痕迹，只是逞才，是沒有什麽用的，只是爲人所詬病罷了。在文學史上的民謠，如堯時擊壞歌（有人說他是后人偽做的），「日出而作，日入而息，鑿井而飲，耕田而食」。是對仗也很自然。舜時南風歌，宋康王舍人之妻何氏烏鵲歌，楚人所修飾優孟慷慨歌，和易書，禮，春秋等，當中也有不少的對仗話。其他如唐宋之詩，對仗的也不少。即如項羽所說「力拔山兮氣蓋世，時不利兮騅不逝」。也是對偶特別工整的。</p>
<p>寫到此，又聯想到濫調來，哀啓訃聞，必說枕塊昏迷。送醫生橫額，不是著手成春，便是術擅岐黃。千篇一律，阿諛諂媚，欺已欺人。而一般初寫語體文的，描寫天空，必用蔚藍，描寫勞動者的努力，多用抗育，也是同一濫調。其實文章最要是內容和造句的流暢，其他如用典對仗，有時不妨夾入一些，給讀者醒目，讀起來似乎也有點趣味。</p>
<h3>「合奏」與「和諧」</h3>
<p>— 宋昌</p>
<p>樂器的合奏，要算管弦樂（Orchesira）的組織最大而最完備。因爲管弦樂是包羅了許多樂器，使用各類樂器的音色而組成，所以音量宏大，表現力也很豐富。各樂器都是有生命的個個人格化，表演起來，差不多好似大樂劇（Drama）的演出。</p>
<p>管弦樂這樣綜錯複雜，爲什麼能够巧妙地配合起來，得以完成良好的效果？這原因完全在於諧和的要素上。諧和的要素可說是構成音樂的基礎。各樂器雖有不同的性狀，各異的音色，特殊的感情，却須全體遵守諧和的條件，是一樣的，才能够合作，顯出協調的精神。</p>
<p>我以爲音樂如此，一個集團，一個國家也是如此。我們的國家，現在已由訓政時期快要進到憲政時期了，正期待着民主政治的實現，向建國大業的完成。各黨各派是政治意見的集團，自然各有主張，可是爲國家着想，應該一致團結起來，在三民主義的共同信念之下，像管弦樂的合奏一樣，由協力的「合奏」而得到完美的「諧和」。</p>
<h3>一件酸心事</h3>
<p>— 上官神</p>
<p>昨天爲了一件急事，我忽忽的跨上一輛三輪車，到我的目的地去。早晨的風吹來有些冷，我翻起了大衣領子。</p>
<p>車夫踏得很慢，身子向前彎着，而且還不時的咳嗽着。</p>
<p>他穿着一件舊西裝上身，肘處已經破了，露出裏面汚穢的絨錢衫來。褲子是中式的夾褲。頭髮養得很長，像足足有一個月沒有理髮了。</p>
<p>大約踏了一半路，我看他越踏越慢下來，在我後面的人力車也趕過我了，我看看錶，已經超過我約定的時間，而那車夫還　斯條理的一下一下踏着，簡直像在推，我煩燥起來，催着。</p>
<p>他沒有答復我，只是脚下踏得用勁了些，但走不到多少路，立刻又慢下來了，我用足頓着，踏脚板，催促着。</p>
<p>他想爲自已分辯一下子似的：「我……」但沒有說下去，伏低了身子，拚命朝前踏着，但立刻像支持不住似的，又慢了下來。</p>
<p>我幾乎要駡，喊着要他停住車，我從車上跳下來，打算付講定一半車費給他，在我在數錢，還怒氣未息時對他一瞪眼的當兒，我呆住了，那站立在我面前的，衰弱而又可憐的車夫，是我小學時一個很好的同學。我的臉上頓時發了燒，很抱歉地不知該怎麽好，而他默默地低下頭，不來看我。</p>
<p>我　低的喚一聲他的名字，他似乎忍不住羞恥反身就走，我立刻了解我傷害了他的自尊，他顯然不願向我自認，我就趕上去，把手裏錢全塞給他，他却在我路後呌住我，過來把錢還我，對我很低聲的說着：「你多給我了。」</p>
<p>他走了，我望着他的背影，一陣心酸！我們從前是朋友，什麼都一樣，而現在，一個坐車，一個踏車，我歉仄地多給他錢，而他却來還我，還說「你多給我了」，淡淡的一句，完全當作了陌路人。</p>
<p>我沉默了一整大……</p>
<p>筆底春秋</p>
<h3>舊事</h3>
<p>— 慕容隨</p>
<p>這是一件很平凡的舊事：</p>
<p>一個考察團到了我們故鄉的一個說小不小的城鎭中去考察，由當地的官署愼重地派了兩名護兵，雇了洋車，領着他們在這個城鎭中考察一番，結果他們覺得印象好極了！</p>
<p>但是他們很聰敏地覺得單獨在城鎭區考察是不够的，他們又和官署中人商量，要到鄉村去考察一下，當然仍舊愼重地派人護送前往，在「東村敬烟」「西村待茶」的結果之下，印象也還不壞。</p>
<p>他們去了。鄉下人上街，大家談起了這事總這麽說：「他們不過考察考察，只多是訪固訪問而已，又不像施公包公私行下鄉察訪，說他做啥？」</p>
<p>又是一件很平凡的舊事：</p>
<p>某一個訪問團到了某一個城鎭。常地的團體開了一個很大的聯合招待會。某訪問團要詳細地知道一點地方情形，向各團體的代表很詳細地詢問着，各代表當然也據實奉答。</p>
<p>但是當這個訪問團臨行的時節，雇了幾個脚夫，不料脚夫在路上倒反而向這訪問團訪問了！「先生！我們這城鎭幾時可以買得到平價布呢？幾時吃得着配給的米和鹽呢？」訪問團才覺得有點「茫然」或者「恍然」！</p>
<p>這不過僅是舊事罷了！現在當然不比從前，許多關心民隱的大員，他們一定能深入民間，他們決不會一般鄉曲小民，惓念着那些落伍的「包公案」和「施公案」了。</p>

<h3>向工務局進建議　趕緊修築曹家渡橋　依照戰前原定計劃</h3>
<p>— 黃一飛</p>
<p>最近市工務局積極修路，市中心區主要道路，業已修竣，殷翔路北首，及北四川路之一段近鐵路處，不日亦可竣工，市區內江蘇路……等，均即可翻修完竣。這十分正確的啓示，値得我們擁護與讚許。我們最感頭痛的：「祗聽樓梯響，不見人下來」的濫調。因爲交通問題，大者關係建國前途，小者關係社會安寗；明年又是交通運動實行時期，筆者不忍忽視了這個新措施，時地提出一個滬西區的交通問題，以備市工務局的參考。</p>
<p>以滬西而論，曹家渡是嘉定南翔眞茹等各地的重要樞紐。上海蔬菜來源，多數自滬西區輸入，一面是船隻運輸，一面是陸上運輸。船隻運輸，姑且不談；首先注意陸上運輸，便不得不注意到一座曹家波僑了。講到曹家渡橋。破壞得不堪設想，若有重車經過，它爲全身搖動，危險性極大，其次該橋南堍，又有屋宇阻碍，故各廠載貨，以及載貨重草經過於此，時有撞死與　河的危險。據悉：民國二十六年左右，市政府建築此橋，原定計劃，將阻　之屋宇，全部撤除，該橋以鋼骨製造，後因八一三戰起，遂敷衍了事。如今交通扳員，盼望工務局依照戰前市府原定計劃，重建曹家渡橋，拆除橋堍阻　屋宇，開關馬路，使市區內外交通，暢達靈便，市民受惠無窮！</p>

<h3>肺病無憂論（四）</h3>
<p>（八）壓縮病灶，爲肺病根本療法　　肺病能早期應用壓縮療法，撲滅病灶，乃爲確實之根本療法，不僅節省經濟時間，且可早日恢復健康，從事生產，家庭社會，兩蒙其利。現代壓縮療法中應用景廣者，爲人工氣胸術，即俗稱打空氣針，乃將氣體注入胸膜腔內是也。蓋肺　於胸腔內，並不與胸廓黏連，其表面與胸廓之內面，均有滑澤之膜一層，覆於其上，其間別成一問腔，注氣體於其中，即成人工氣胸，肺臟病灶部份戰迫萎縮而靜止，减除緊張狀態，而得休息機會，因此其病遂易治愈。如肺部已有空洞，則空洞亦可因萎縮而四圍得以密接，由新組織之增生而空洞即漸漸消滅，又因病灶壓縮，血流徐報，淋巴液　積，此可停止患部之出血，及制止患者自身結核菌之轉移，或傳播於他人，並可减少結核菌毒素之吸收，故患者自行人工氣胸後其最顯著而最先得之效果，即爲吐血停止，潮熱速降，痰中結核菌消失，體重漸增，全身狀况佳良，故人工氣胸，實爲肺癆之根本療法，無論老幼，皆可施行，毫無痛苦，在施行期內，並可照常工作此尤爲其特點</p>

The enthusiastic atmosphere was unprecedented in the city recently. After Marshal Marshall arrived at his residence, he rested briefly and went to General Wedemeyer's cocktail party at 6 PM.

<h3>The Executive Yuan Orders Strict Implementation of Opium Prohibition in Recovered Areas</h3>
<p>Plans Made to Burn Confiscated Opium in Beiping and Shanghai</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] During the war, the enemy puppets implemented a policy of poisoning the people. The recovered areas are permeated with poisonous fumes, and the number of addicts reaches over thirty million. If this huge number of opium addicts is not restored to productivity, it will be an obstacle to national reconstruction. After the Ministry of Interior drafted eleven emergency measures for opium prohibition in the recovered areas, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and was circulated to the provincial and municipal governments for strict implementation.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] According to the Ministry of Interior, the Beiping Puppet Opium Prohibition Bureau was the central agency for the enemy puppets' poisoning of the provinces of North China. When our Beiping Pacification Office took over, it sealed up over 860,000 taels of opium. In addition, the Shanghai Puppet Opium Prohibition Bureau was the agency for the enemy puppets in Nanjing to transport and sell opium. After the takeover, it sealed up over 200,000 taels of opium. The Ministry of Interior has drafted measures for supervised public burning and submitted them for approval. Furthermore, all those in Shanghai who plant, transport, sell, or hide opium are required to apply for self-renewal and submit opium and tools before the end of the year to avoid punishment. Those who fail to do so will be severely punished according to the law. Opium addicts are required to quit before the end of February next year. Those who fail to quit after the deadline will be punished as relapse offenders.</p>

<h3>U.S. Governor of the Philippines Arrives in Shanghai Meets with Wedemeyer to Discuss Related Issues Claims Reports of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in the Philippines are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] U.S. Governor of the Philippines McNutt, and U.S. Pacific Fleet Deputy Commander Luce, along with a group of ten entourage members, flew from Manila via Tokyo to this question at 4:30 PM yesterday.

According to Mr. McNutt speaking to this reporter: The United States has decided to allow the Philippines to become independent in 1946, but if the natural, uninfluenced by external factors, request to retain the original form is made, then we may especially consider the request. This time, I plan to come to Shanghai to discuss issues related to the connection between China and the Philippines with General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the China Theater. There are many overseas Chinese in the Philippines, and mutual assistance is necessary in commerce and other aspects. The reporter asked if it was true that there was anti-Chinese sentiment among the people of the Philippines. Mr. McNutt replied: This is a baseless rumor.

At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, eleven representatives from the association, including Mr. Li Huade, went to Special Envoy Marshall's residence on the tenth floor of the Cathay Hotel to present the petition of respect. They were received by Special Envoy Marshall's representative, who expressed his gratitude, and then they withdrew. The full text of the petition of respect is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Special Envoy Marshall: We are so anxiously awaiting your arrival, for the sake of our country's future and the guarantee of world peace, waiting for you to eliminate the shadow of peace and the crisis of victory. When we heard the news of Ambassador Hurley's resignation, we felt very surprised and even astonished that the American diplomatic policy would shift. Then, when we learned of the report that you would be appointed as the special envoy to China, this made our momentary doubts about the United States completely disappear and at the same time increased our confidence. Because every Chinese person deeply believes that the special envoy will use the determination to command operations and complete victory to uphold justice and resolve all the difficulties at this stage. We want to cheer, cheer that the sacred War of Resistance has won a comprehensive victory, cheer that the anti-aggressors have truly grasped the fruits of victory. In the process of the war, our country's strength has made a powerful response and argument to the aggressors' foolish neglect, and it has an indispensable factor in stabilizing this turbulent situation. Past facts tell us that small fuses can have huge consequences, and today's China is not the China of eight years ago, especially the China at this stage. Special Envoy Marshall, we hope that you will pay attention and deeply understand, and use your past enthusiasm for caring for China to help us. In the past eight years, the Chinese people have suffered unprecedented catastrophes, and people who have been displaced all hope to go home and live a peaceful life quietly. But they are disappointed, and their wishes have become bubbles. What the newspapers bring are only tragic news. The Jinpu and Pingsui Railways have all been destroyed by the Communist army, obstructing the work of taking over and disregarding the life and death of the people. The Communist army invaded and controlled eastern Sui. Although the War of Resistance has been victorious, the people still suffer catastrophes. We oppose all wars. War has exhausted us. We demand quiet. We want to live a peaceful life. Today, when victory comes, we see the signs of division again. How heartbreaking is this? The Communist Party's non-cooperation and separatist policies have caused disturbances in China. These disturbances are hindering our country's unification, casting a gray shadow over victory, and making us feel sad about our country's future. The United States is our loyal friend. In the war to destroy aggression and undemocratic forces, it has always helped us. We also have the utmost confidence and believe that our friend will definitely assist us in completing peaceful unification. Finally, we ask Special Envoy Marshall to appeal to the U.S. government to understand China's current situation, assist the central government, build a new, democratic, free, and prosperous China, establish a permanent foundation for world peace, and complete the highest and most beautiful ideal of Datong. Dear Special Envoy Marshall, we respectfully extend our infinite love with familiarity and wish Special Envoy Marshall good health! (Central News Agency)</p>

<p>[United Press, Peiping, 20th] As Christmas approaches, the Nine Eastern Provinces are once again shrouded in mystery and a slight pessimism. Chinese newspapers are mentioning the delicate relationship of Sino-Soviet negotiations. National Army troops are awaiting orders to enter Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin, but currently, they cannot avoid futile hope. Chiang Ching-kuo is scheduled to go to Changchun again on the 21st. Dong Yanping, Director of the Chinese Military Representative Office, after a two-hour meeting with the Soviet Chief of Staff in Changchun on the 18th, has made some progress in liaison matters between Chinese and Soviet troops in the Nine Eastern Provinces, and another meeting will be held in the coming days, but there seems to be no hope for a quick resolution. Even after the Northeast territorial issues are resolved, China's desire to restore the economy of the Eastern Provinces and enable them to become self-reliant faces many difficulties. After Japan occupied the Northeast, it issued 500,000 million yuan in counterfeit currency, which increased the price index by 70 times. In July of this year, knowing that they were defeated, the Japanese issued another 300,000 million yuan in counterfeit currency and prepaid two years' worth of salaries for key government officials to purchase "essential goods." As a result, the price index increased another 30 times.</p>

<p>Also, United Press reports that Truman has proposed the appointment of the following five individuals as alternate U.S. representatives to the United Nations: Representative Bloom (Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee), Representative Eaton, former Postmaster General Walker, and New York lawyer Dulles (foreign policy advisor to Republican presidential candidate Dewey).</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The proposal for the United States to fully participate in the United Nations organization has been passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. There were slight differences in the content of the bills passed by the two houses, so a joint committee was organized to adjust them and complete the entire bill, which was passed without objection by both houses within half an hour. The bill has now been sent to President Truman for his signature and implementation.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] At today's meeting of the United Nations organization committee here, the Soviet Union and the Philippines prevailed in their dispute with countries possessing colonies, and it was decided to authorize the United Nations Trusteeship Council to elect spokespersons for the various nationalities in the colonies on the colonies' own soil. This type of election is not of a delegated nature, but the new regulations for this procedure of the Council recognize this principle. The United States, Britain, South Africa, and China voted against this proposal.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] The U.S. delegation to the United Nations organization preparatory committee had originally advocated that all countries concerned should enjoy equal rights when territories under the League of Nations mandate were transferred to the United Nations Trusteeship Council. At today's meeting, the U.S. delegation announced that it was abandoning this original proposal and instead advocated that the United Nations General Assembly notify the mandated countries to take the same action as other directly related countries to hand over their mandated territories to the United Nations for management. In this way, the United States and other countries without mandated territories will be in a secondary position in future discussions on Palestine and the Pacific islands under Australian and New Zealand mandate. The United States believes that the above approach does not affect its position on the mandated islands of百本(likely a typo and should be 南洋, the South Seas), as these territories can be regarded as territories "separated from enemy countries," and the major powers have a significant responsibility for them. In addition, the British representative proposed that the permanent headquarters of the United Nations organization should be located in a small town in the eastern United States. The Indian representative stated that there should be no restrictions in the location of the United Nations organization that would be regarded as prejudiced. The British representative agreed with this.</p>

<h3>Acheson Issues Statement on Negotiations between Netherlands-Indonesia and Britain-Siam; Hopes for Renewed Efforts for Reconciliation; Requests Britain and Siam to Postpone Signing Any Agreements</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson met with reporters today to discuss the situation in the Dutch East Indies, which is the State Department's first statement on the policy it is taking on the Dutch East Indies issue. Acheson stated that the United States is increasingly concerned about the situation in the Dutch East Indies and hopes that all parties will renew their efforts to achieve reconciliation. The primary responsibility for reaching an agreement on the Dutch East Indies issue should be borne jointly by the Netherlands and the leaders of the independent army. The United States cannot but pay close attention to whether a major issue that affects the world can be resolved. The United States' only hope is that the East Indies issue can be resolved peacefully, so as to contribute to promoting world security and prosperity and improving the well-being of the people. Solutions can only be achieved through realistic, tolerant, and cooperative negotiations, and differences can only be eliminated through peaceful means. Acheson also solemnly declared that the United States has a considerable relationship with events occurring in Southeast Asia and has requested Britain and Siam to postpone peace negotiations. It is believed that although the United States has not been able to directly participate in the negotiations, it should have ample opportunity to express its views to Britain in advance.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Undersecretary of State Acheson announced today that the United States has requested Britain and Siam to postpone signing any agreement until U.S.-British negotiations are concluded. The United States has repeatedly made this request. On one occasion, when Britain and Siam seemed about to formally sign a truce agreement, the United States also requested a postponement. The United States has two reasons: (1) the United States and Siam have always maintained friendly relations, and the United States expresses its sympathy for Siam's desire to establish an independent and democratic government; (2) the United States has expended great effort in fighting against Japan, and the United States has a major concern for the overall peace and stability of the Far East. The United States has been regularly receiving reports on the development of British-Siamese negotiations, but recently, due to weather conditions, news has been interrupted. British officials here believe that the British-Siamese agreement is expected to be signed within the next week.</p>
<p>British-Siamese Treaty to Be Announced Soon</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph reported today that an agreement on the terms of peace between Britain and Siam is expected to be announced on Christmas. The terms are believed to include the following: Siam should reimburse all allied forces' supply expenses, compensate for all losses suffered by British property during the Japanese occupation, and the export and production of commodities such as rice, teak, and rubber should be subject to the control of the Allied authorities until the world no longer lacks these products. The correspondent also stated that U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson's remarks in Washington yesterday caused considerable confusion among London officials. It is reported that Acheson said that the U.S. government had requested Britain and Siam not to conclude any agreement "while discussions with the U.S. were ongoing," and that the United States had a clear and legitimate interest in the situation in Siam, but it is understood that no discussions regarding Siam have taken place with the United States, and Britain has informed the United States in detail of the progress of the negotiations with Siam, and the United States has expressed its agreement to this.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor to Go to London Soon</h3>

<p>[United Press, Sydney, 19th] The manager of a Dutch shipping company announced today that approximately 300 East Indies sailors have refused to work on Dutch ships and will be repatriated as soon as ships are available. The company has agreed to provide the sailors with food and accommodation until they board the ships.</p>
<h3>Konoe's Memoirs Describe the Causes and Consequences of the Great War; The Emperor Failed to Suppress the War Faction, Leading to Disaster</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] The following is recorded in the memoirs left behind by Fumimaro Konoe after his suicide. He claimed that apart from the Emperor himself, no one could make the Japanese militarist war faction obey, but unfortunately, the Emperor did not take active action, which ultimately led to disaster. Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States and Japan were working hard to conduct peace talks. At that time, even the Japanese army and navy authorities, as well as the diplomatic community, deeply felt that the Emperor was taking a completely non-interfering attitude. There is no doubt that the Emperor sincerely hoped for peace, but he took no active action to achieve peace. Konoe did not blame himself for the failure of his second and third cabinets but instead criticized the Japanese government for not allowing the Japanese army to act arbitrarily, as if completely detached from the other ministries of the Japanese government. While the Japanese government was doing its best to negotiate with the United States, the Japanese military was actively preparing for war, as if the negotiations had already failed. Moreover, the Japanese cabinet had no idea what preparations the military was making at that time, and the Japanese warships were moving frequently, and the army and navy had entered a state of mobilization. When the United States, which was negotiating with Japan, learned of Japan's preparations for war, it gradually became suspicious of Japan and thought that Japan had no sincerity in seeking peace. In September 1941, when U.S.-Japan relations were most strained, it was crucial for Japan to decide whether to make peace or go to war. Prince Higashikuni, the Emperor's brother, advocated taking a conciliatory policy and said: "There is no better way than the Emperor's decisive action." According to the Japanese army, peace talks were bound to fail, and they wanted to fight. The navy, while deeply afraid of defeat, was unwilling to publicly advocate peace and oppose the army. Marquis Kido, the Japanese Minister of the Imperial Household, told United Press reporter Beles that the Emperor often did not oppose the army's views. However, according to our observation, if the Emperor had truly ordered the army to stop preparing for war, war could not have been avoided. Konoe said in his memoirs that he had heard the Emperor tell Higashikuni several times that the Japanese army's actions were truly regrettable and had expressed the same to Konoe. Konoe also said: Higashikuni had questioned the Emperor, asking why he was indifferent to the overall situation, and if he thought the situation was bad, why didn't he stand up and publicly announce the bad situation. Konoe thought of explaining to Higashikuni that the Emperor rarely expressed his opinions, and people might suspect that the Emperor was hesitant in the face of events. Prince Saionji, a senior Japanese statesman, had considerable influence on the Emperor, so that the Emperor even intended to make his personal position the same as that of the King of England. Saionji and others had advised the Emperor that he should not take the initiative unless it was absolutely necessary, because when the Emperor ordered the formation of a cabinet, he only emphasized the following three matters in particular and gave no other instructions: (1) Respect the Japanese Constitution, (2) Do not be too insistent on diplomatic matters, (3) Do not cause drastic changes in the financial sector. Konoe argued that the Japanese Constitution was slightly different from the British Constitution, that is, the Japanese Constitution took the Emperor's personal rule as its center. Especially in military affairs, the Japanese government had no say in the military, and only the Emperor could manage both the Japanese government and the military at the same time. The Emperor could be conservative in ordinary times, but at the critical juncture of the country's peace or war, the Emperor's passive attitude was enough to put the country in extreme difficulty. Konoe made this final judgment on the Emperor: "The Emperor's attitude was passive, but his heart always wished to maintain peace. He hoped and tried to prevent Japan from falling into any great war of uncertain outcome."</p>
<h3>U.S. Congressional Leaders Support Merger of Army and Navy; Navy Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] U.S. congressional leaders have agreed to consider President Truman's proposal to merge the Army and Navy early next year, but it is believed that there will be fierce debate beforehand. Members of the Navy Committees of both houses are the most vehemently opposed, believing that the Army will annex the smaller Navy, making it a secondary unit. Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, called this plan "a coercive expression of power politics." He said: "If this plan were introduced by an allied democratic country, we would view it with suspicion and fear." Vinson continued: This plan "will sink the Navy to the bottom of the sea."</p>
<h3>U.S. Railroads to Use Radio from the End of the Year; Enables Trains and Vehicles to Communicate, Increasing Safety and Saving Time</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] U.S. railroads will begin using radio from the 31st of this month to enable trains and vehicles to communicate, increasing safety and saving time. This "railroad radio" is being established under the auspices of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. According to the committee, this measure will prevent accidents and increase traffic efficiency. It is believed that it will be widely used in American trains, and 129 applications have already been approved for trial.</p>
<p>Experimentation with radio on railroads has been going on for years, but it only saw a significant increase in scale and nature during the war. The war has made radio equipment stronger rather than weaker. Its success in tanks, aircraft, and amphibious vehicles shows that the vibration of trains is also not an obstacle.</p>
<p>The American Railroad Association has announced that radio equipment will not be widely used next year because training radio operators and ordering and installing equipment will take time. Here are some examples of how radio can increase traffic safety:</p>
<p>(1) Smoke is seen in a car of train A by train B passing by. Through communication between the two trains, the crew of train B can immediately notify the engineer of train A. The noise of the train will not affect the engineer, because the required personnel can be immediately summoned using a portable radio telephone with a loudspeaker.</p>
<p>(2) If a conductor on a mile-long freight train sees an object about to fall on a middle car or other dangerous situation, he can order the engineer to stop the train through communication between the vehicles. This avoids using the rear brake of the car, as using this brake before the engine stops can often cause the car to split in two. Also, when a long car is backing up, it is necessary to have communication between the engine and the rear of the car.</p>
<p>(3) In the event of an accident in a remote area, you have to go several miles to make a phone call. A train equipped with radio can immediately send a distress signal. In 1943, a train overturned, and the conductor walked three miles to get a phone to call for help. In addition, radio has the benefit of increasing the speed of traffic. Engineers can issue orders to open switches at track switches via radio, and those controlling the brakes do not have to stick their heads out of the car in the cold to talk to the engineers.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Orders Japanese Government to Postpone General Election; Japanese Cooperation Party Established</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Authoritative sources told the Central News Agency reporter exclusively that General MacArthur's headquarters has asked the Japanese government to postpone the upcoming general election.

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Emperor will meet with Japanese journalists on the morning of the 23rd. This is the first time in Japanese history that the Emperor has met with Japanese journalists.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 20th] Fifty members of the Imperial Palace Guard went on strike today, and the remaining five hundred and fifty members threatened to strike as well, demanding the dismissal of key officials and the adoption of other democratization measures. This unprecedented situation has panicked court officials, who are at a loss as to how to explain it to the Emperor.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Prime Minister Shidehara stated today that he and his cabinet will not resign. Shidehara said that he would heed public opinion and only resign if the people wanted him to. Political observers believe that Shidehara's statement indicates that he intends to remain in his current position until he is forced to step down during the general election in the last week of January next year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Plans to Reduce Food Rationing for the People</h3>
<p>Likely to Cause Serious Repercussions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Japanese government is reportedly reducing its food rations because farmers are refusing to submit this year's autumn harvest to the government. Up to December, farmers accepted orders and sold only 11% of the total rice to the government at market prices. Japan will face a severe rice shortage in February next year. The government is forced to reduce food rations to the people in mid-January. However, this measure by the government will inevitably cause a strong backlash from the general public, especially in urban areas.</p>

<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting Relief for the Silk Industry</p>
<p>Xue Mingjian, a National Councilor and the current Chairman of the Sunan District Branch of the Chinese National Federation of Industries, stated that Wuxi's silk industry has always been well-developed. However, during the occupation, most of the silk reeling factories were destroyed by the enemy. Moreover, the villagers in the rural areas, due to the low value of silk cocoons under enemy control, have lost interest in silkworm rearing and have converted mulberry fields to grow rice and wheat, resulting in severe and unbearable losses. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the homeland has been restored, reviving the rural economy and providing relief to the silk industry is an urgent task. Yesterday, he specifically put forward several key points in a telegram requesting President Song of the Executive Yuan and Vice President Weng to review, consider, and adopt them for implementation.</p>

<h3>"Little Shanghai" in a Corner of Jiangnan: The Newborn Posture of Wuxi</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Canglong</p>
<p>Wuxi—the "Little Shanghai" in this Jiangnan region. Since the arrival of the Third War Area General Headquarters, its important position on the Nanjing-Shanghai line has been further enhanced. This time, the Third War Area News Liaison Group, as the Jinghu Garrison Area Pacification Work Supervision Group, is about to start working. It specially invited the Shanghai Journalists Group to Wuxi to participate in and cooperate with the reporting work of the various groups of the regiment. The motion to send reporters was only decided on the eve of departure. Everything seemed hasty and unprepared. Although the stay in Wuxi was only for two full days, the general outline of Wuxi cannot be said to be entirely vague.</p>
<p>On the evening of arrival in Wuxi, at the banquet hosted by Commander Tang for the staff of the Supervision Group, I heard his determination to restore local order and organize the people's armed forces. He explained the need to implement the baojia system, and he expressed his agreement to the requests from various localities to issue firearms for self-defense. However, he would encourage the construction of pillboxes and the proper use of these firearms as much as possible. Finally, he repeatedly encouraged the staff members to uphold the virtues of the central government to appease the people, not to increase the burden on the people in any way, and to ensure that all measures meet the needs of both the government and the people. At the lunch hosted by Regiment Commander Sun Yuanliang the next day, I heard about the organization and work of the Supervision Group. I learned that the Supervision Group is a collective organization of the party, government, and military, with the duty of inspecting and supervising the various troops and local party and government organs within the Jinghu Garrison Area, with the aim of increasing the efficiency of the pacification work. It is estimated that the inspection and supervision work will last for about two to three months. In addition to reporting on the news in the supervised areas, the reporters from various newspapers participating in the Supervision Group will also have to undertake part of the mission of inspection and supervision. The work is arduous and the responsibilities are heavy, but in two or three months, when the Jiangnan region, which has been turbulent and chaotic for many years, once again bears the fruit of tranquility, how happily will we celebrate together?</p>
<p>Let the People Breathe: The County Magistrate Worries About Daily Necessities</p>
<p>Since the liberated areas were temporarily exempted from land tax, and the central government could not provide subsidies for a while, local governments have generally experienced financial panic, and Wuxi is certainly no exception. According to County Magistrate Fan, the county government's current tax revenue only comes from entertainment, slaughter, licenses, and house rentals, which are less than one-tenth of the expenditures. However, he is unwilling to collect taxes from the people in rural areas. He said that the people in rural areas had five or six burdens at the same time in the past. Now, they have finally taken a breath from eight years of suffering. He is really unwilling to impose even a small burden. He believes that only by reducing the burden on the people can the hearts of the people be won back. Therefore, he borrowed 35 million yuan from the city chamber of commerce to temporarily make up for the deficit. However, just maintaining the more than 5,000 staff members of the various departments under the county government feels strained. In addition, the more than 600 brothers in the county security team need to urgently purchase a batch of cotton uniforms because the weather has suddenly turned cold, which requires an expenditure of more than 40 million yuan at once, which is really difficult to raise. He said with great emotion that he is simply a county magistrate who worries about daily necessities!</p>
<p>In addition, he felt another difficulty: the lack of cadres and incomplete laws and regulations. He said that the war has been extended for eight years, and the cadre talents have been lost. Some of them have taken on the air of the puppet regime, and some truly talented people dare not come out rashly because the local security is not stable, which makes him feel lonely and unable to support himself. Furthermore, the incompleteness of laws and regulations makes many administrative measures lack a basis. But I think that the future of national construction is arduous. "Many difficulties" can "revive the country," and "many difficulties" may not be the first step in building a great Wuxi. County Magistrate Fan said it well that the county government's only current policy is how to make the people live and work in peace and contentment. All other measures and plans are ancillary.</p>
<p>Visiting Japanese Prisoners of War at Huishan: Eliminating the Cancer of Democracy</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 17th, in the roaring northwest wind, our group visited the Huishan Japanese Prisoner of War Concentration Camp. The Japanese prisoners of war concentrated here all belonged to the 27th Division of the Japanese Army. The mastermind of the division—Lieutenant General Ochiai Seijuro—lived far away in a desolate temple on the top of Ji Mountain. We climbed the mud path step by step, and all along the way were endless tombs. The temple was on the peak of the tombs. When we stepped into Lieutenant General Ochiai's room, we saw several bottles of foreign wine and some valuable cigarettes on the wall shelf. He sat peacefully in a rattan chair, while the reporters stood around him, firing questions at him like a string of pearls. However, he nonchalantly answered evasively, followed by a series of hackneyed clichés of gratitude for the leniency of the Chinese side towards them. I am simply tired of hearing these stereotyped thanks for leniency. Is that all that is in the head of Lieutenant General Ochiai, who once served as the "Director of the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board," a "young officer," and a "China expert"? I was at a loss. I deeply realized the success of the Japanese military's national education in controlling the thinking of their soldiers. Control! Control! This terrible cancer of democracy, we should completely eradicate it. We should reform the minds of Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Back to the Huishan Japanese Prisoner of War Concentration Camp, it was almost five o'clock. It is said that there are more than 17,000 Japanese prisoners of war here, who were once famous elite divisions of Japan. When we entered the camp for a visit, most of them were already lying in bed covered with quilts. It is said that each Japanese prisoner of war can be rationed 700 grams of rice a day, which is about the same as the ration of Chinese soldiers. When we visited their food warehouse, we saw that there were still considerable quantities of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains stored.</p>
<p>Visiting Various Newspaper Offices: Woodcuts are Particularly Exquisite</p>
<p>This time, because it was a visit by the Shanghai Journalists Group, the Wuxi press circles were busy hosting banquets. The Wuxi press circles currently have three daily newspapers: "Da Xi Bao," "Jiangsu Min Bao," and "Da Feng Bao." There is one evening newspaper: "Wuxi Wan Bao." In addition, there is also the Xishan News Agency, which has a long history. Two newspapers, "Zhen Zhong Daily" and "Liangxi Daily," are in preparation. It is said that the "Ren Bao" and "Xinwen Huibao," which were published before the War of Resistance, will also be relaunched. With so many newspapers published in a city with a population of only about one million, the situation cannot be said to be not flourishing. We visited all the newspaper offices once. Only "Jiangsu Min Bao" has its own printing press. What is admirable is the craftsmen who carve the characters. The large-sized sample titles can be carved in a proper form, and even general celebrity photos, because there is no plate-making equipment, are mostly carved with woodcuts, which can also be carved vividly, but the cost is far below that of plate-making. These are also valuable products under the conditions of short materials and equipment.</p>
<p>Factories Have Resumed Work: Many Chimneys are Not Smoking</p>
<p>During this trip to Wuxi, because I came and went in a hurry, I regret that I could not make a field tour of the factories that Wuxi is famous for. I only got some fragmentary concepts from oral statements. It is said that about six or seven out of ten factories have resumed work. However, due to the lack of fuel, the damage to machinery, and the shortage of raw materials, the production volume of each factory is far less than two or three out of ten before the war. Some places show even more obvious contradictions. For example, due to the cost of power (electricity for industrial use in Shanghai is more than 40 yuan per degree, while in Wuxi it costs 240 yuan), the flour production in Shanghai is not only greater than that in Wuxi, but also reverses the previous practice of flour being transported from Wuxi to Shanghai, resulting in a backflow phenomenon. Therefore, unless power, fuel, and raw materials are fundamentally resolved, the prospects for Wuxi's light industry are difficult to rejuvenate. On the afternoon of the 18th, the reporters hurriedly embarked on the return journey again. In the wriggling of the engine wheels, they stretched their necks and looked at the many chimneys outside the city of Wuxi. Many of them were not smoking, and only a few that were smoking were thin. This scene symbolizes the industrial circles of Wuxi. But I am looking forward to the coming of next spring, when Jiangnan will become a pure land, the people will be working hard, "living and working in peace and contentment," and Wuxi will restore its industrial prosperity. Every chimney will be emitting thick black smoke, no longer just a "Little Shanghai" willing to follow, but a "Great Wuxi" that can stand alone.</p>
<h3>Kaohsiung, Taiwan's Second Largest City, Rebuilt in the Rubble</h3>
<p>— United Press Correspondent, Edward F. Haulk</p>
<p>Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city, was bombed by American explosive bombs and incendiary bombs, and eight-tenths of the city has been destroyed. These days, the citizens of the city are carrying shovels, hoes, and baskets to clear this pile of rubble.</p>
<p>Teachers and students of the school, like ordinary workers, are working shoulder to shoulder under the command of the mayor. They filled the bomb craters and swept away the rubble piles. Then, the engineering team broke and flattened the towering dangerous walls. In this way, Kaohsiung is like a military field, because 32,000 of the city's 40,000 houses have been destroyed.</p>
<p>The previous American bombing not only caused material damage to Kaohsiung but also caused economic damage at the same time. Although the number of Taiwanese people killed or injured in the daily bombing since January of this year was only about 500, the more shops destroyed, the more difficult it became to buy food every day. Before the Japanese surrender, local prices rose sharply. After the Chinese army was stationed, the Japanese price limit mechanism failed, and prices jumped endlessly. Five years ago, it only cost 15 cents to buy a pound of rice, but by August of this year, it had risen to 3 Japanese yen. In our opinion, 3 yuan is only a small amount, but the average Taiwanese worker only earns 1.5 or 2 Japanese yen per day.</p>
<p>A Wave of Price Increases</p>
<p>The prices of other commodities also rose along with rice. Fish now costs 16 Japanese yen per pound, which was only enough for 1 yuan five years ago. Pork has risen from 1 yuan to 32 yuan per pound, beef from 50 cents to 10 yuan per pound, and chicken has also increased 20 times.</p>
<p>After the Chinese army was stationed, the authorities immediately tried to solve the food problem. They successively convened several meetings of local leaders to discuss various measures to avoid serious food shortages. However, the black market is still rampant, and the price increase is still in progress, because of the overabundance of Chinese currency in the northern part of the island, the prices have been raised even higher.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, although the exchange rate between Chinese currency and Japanese yen has not been officially set, merchants are generally willing to exchange 1.5 Japanese yen for 1 Customs Gold Unit. As for the exchange rate for US dollars, there is no regulation in the local area, but 1 US dollar can be exchanged for 1,500 Chinese currency, which is then converted into 112 Japanese yen. These black market exchange rates are the same as the situation after the Chinese army was stationed in Vietnam. At that time, commercial trade could only use the black market exchange rate. Later, General Lu Han issued a notice, which made the black market a legitimate exchange rate.</p>
<p>Currently, many store owners in Kaohsiung have built wooden sheds in the ruins to do business, while some have moved to small towns or rural areas, and some are simply sitting and not doing business.</p>
<p>Looking for a Job</p>
<p>The factories in Kaohsiung are still closed, and those workers who have not left are trying to find jobs. The Japanese said that food is becoming scarce day by day, and their agricultural experiment stations have been robbed, which is something that has never happened before. The Chinese authorities said that this robbery was a manifestation of the people's hatred and contempt for the Japanese.</p>
<p>After the new Chinese mayor took office, his first measure was to prohibit shops from closing down in order to stabilize the local market. At the same time, he also ordered all schools to resume classes and all industrial factories that are under construction to continue construction.</p>
<p>Politically, it was previously reported that an independence movement had occurred in Taiwan, but there is no sign of it now. It is said that these elements have hidden themselves due to the stationing of the Chinese army. They led demonstrations and incited the people to demand independence in the days before the Japanese surrender. However, the people of Taiwan currently show no signs of dissatisfaction with the stationing of the Chinese army in appearance. After the Chinese receiving officials arrived in Taiwan, they conducted research on the political situation in the local area with the investigation team. According to those close to Chief Executive Chen Yi, although he himself is a geologist and chemist, he came to Taiwan to study the development of local agriculture, but his main task is politics. It is said that another Chinese military intelligence officer has also come to Taiwan to study the political situation.</p>
<p>When they inspected a certain industrial factory in Kaohsiung, they instructed the representatives: all senior Japanese staff must be dismissed completely, the sooner the better. The majority of the local citizens of Taiwan are Chinese, and most of them demand a position in the Taiwan Provincial Government. There are also some employees who previously worked in factories managed by the Japanese army, and they demand that the authorities take over the factories from them.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities have repeatedly said verbally that the senior Japanese staff in the industrial circles of Taiwan will be dismissed separately. If this measure is implemented, it will create very serious problems, because those senior positions require trained experts to take over, and China does not have so many talents for a while. It is remembered that the Japanese technicians at the Kaohsiung Agricultural Experiment Station said that they would not want to stay in Taiwan if they were not under the leadership of Dr. Iso Eikichi. Iso Eikichi is the former director of the Agricultural Experiment Station and is one of the world's rice production authorities. He has lived in Taiwan for thirty-five years and may be appointed as the honorary minister of the Ministry of Agriculture in the future. He himself also expressed that if he has the opportunity to continue research, he is willing to stay in Taiwan to work. (Special Translation by the Newspaper Translation Department)</p>
<h3>Black Smoke Obscures the Sky, Cannon Fire Falls Silent: Hong Kong's Terrifying Memories - A Painful Recollection Before and After the Fall</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Hong Kong experienced the outbreak of war on December 8, 1941. Kowloon fell in less than four days. Hong Kong, being an island surrounded by water, was difficult for the enemy to land on, thus it was able to defend itself for a longer period. However, because the local military strength was weak and there were no reinforcements, it was difficult to defend. Nevertheless, the British troops were united in their efforts to resist the enemy. Even after enduring two so-called "peaceful offensives" from the Japanese invaders, who dispatched so-called "peace envoys" to Hong Kong to negotiate terms, the Governor of Hong Kong sternly rejected them, refusing to cease fighting until the very end.</p>
<p>Several oil depots in Causeway Bay (Prince Edward Road) were set ablaze, the black smoke soaring into the sky, not ceasing for days and nights. In Stanley, Shau Kei Wan, and other locations, Japanese troops landed, leading to several days of bloody battles. The enemy forces increased without diminishing, and gradually advanced westward. The cannons firing from Kowloon towards Hong Kong continued with dozens of blasts in succession, battering the area near the Stubbs Road automobile route (a trestle-like road) to pieces. Japanese troops invaded and controlled areas around Blue Pool Road and Causeway Bay.</p>
<p>**Artillery Silenced, City Cloaked in Gray**</p>
<p>I was living on Sing Wo Road in Happy Valley. Just a dozen or so yards from my doorstep, two temporary howitzer positions were set up. Each time they fired, the walls shook, and the glass windows and doors rattled. Enemy planes frequently dropped leaflets from the sky, attempting to confuse and mislead people. However, on the 24th, the situation in the city changed somewhat. Air raid personnel disappeared. On the roads, in the ditches, and in the open spaces, there were many air raid personnel and police hats and uniforms scattered haphazardly. The service personnel guarding the air raid shelters announced to the refugees inside that they would no longer maintain order that evening. This made the refugees uneasy. Because the local order was disrupted, the Hong Kong side artillery was no longer firing much. Several Indian artillerymen in front of my residence had taken the firing pins away from the cannons, leaving only two cannon bodies behind. The shells were also removed. The entire city was cloaked in a layer of gray, and everyone's heart was filled with extraordinary fear, fearing a great disaster and that the bitter fruit was about to be tasted.</p>
<p>As expected, at around 9:00 PM, the advance cavalry of the Japanese troops was setting up defenses in Happy Valley. Several Taiwanese interpreters, acting like tigers, were going from house to house, urging residents to hang medicine flags and forcibly write the words "Welcome the Great Japanese Imperial Army" and paste them on their doors. The manager of the Kim Yoke Lau restaurant was seized and taken to guide them to the homes of important people. Happy Valley was close to Causeway Bay, so the vanguard of the Japanese troops arrived in Happy Valley first.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th, British soldiers, Indian soldiers, volunteer forces, etc. (the air raid personnel had disappeared) retreated westward without being pursued by the Japanese troops. Half an hour later, Japanese troops followed and entered the central district, firing several shots into the air. At the same time, planes showed off in the sky, and the Japanese artillery positions in Kowloon fired dozens of shots. Thus, Hong Kong fell into the clutches of the demons. When the British soldiers left the artillery positions, they destroyed all the machine parts of each cannon, thoroughly damaging the muzzles. They also damaged machine guns, armored vehicles, and cannon shells. Knowing that a time of hardship had arrived, they drank heavily to stimulate their nerves.</p>
<p>**Japanese Troops Paste Seals; No Payment, No Unsealing**</p>
<p>After entering the urban area, the Japanese troops immediately took out prepared wooden boards, writing on them such things as "Military and Civilian Affairs Department," "Navy Department," "Army Department," "Reporting Department," etc., and nailed seals to various banks, large shops, warehouses, government offices, schools, hospitals, large restaurants, newspaper offices, bookstores, and large buildings. Many entrances were sealed with more than one board, and some had seals in the name of several departments, indicating their chaotic activity. At the same time, it also showed their struggle for territory and power. Therefore, later, to unseal the place, one had to contact each unit that had nailed a wooden board and pay a fee before it could be processed. If one unit didn't agree, even if the so-called "Governor of Hong Kong" approved, it would be of no use. The lack of unified command among the Japanese troops and their pursuit of self-interest and struggle for power were evident. All public and private institutions and large buildings in Hong Kong were occupied. Barbed wire was laid at key traffic points on various roads, and pedestrians were subject to inspection. Streetcars and buses stopped running, electric lights were dim, and tap water came intermittently. Some places had their water supply cut off. Shops closed down, and small shops only opened one door.</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers, especially Martin (husband), dragged a bayonet and, under the pretext of searching for military supplies, went to various houses to harass the residents. Watches, fountain pens, cameras, flashlights, telescopes, etc., were taken as soon as they were seen. If they weren't found, they were forced to be found. The seizure of Hong Kong currency was initially not considered important by them. All public and private cars were parked in Happy Valley and the open space next to HSBC, numbering no less than several thousand.</p>
<p>Women were trembling with fear of the arrival of Japanese troops and disguised themselves to conceal their identities. Some used the water of "gardenia" to paint on their faces and hands, pretending to be sick, or changed into male attire and cut their hair short. Some ran to Catholic churches, asking Italians for protection. Those of mixed race did not dare to walk on the street, fearing that they would be mistaken for British or American citizens and sent to concentration camps.</p>
<p>The scoundrels who had been imprisoned at Wang's news paper office were released and engaged in vigorous activities, resuming publication immediately and shamelessly praising the Japanese army. Beating face-sized wash basins was a cry for help indicating harassment by Japanese soldiers. Transportation between Hong Kong and Kowloon was restored that day, but only for the Japanese army. Vendors only sold small items in the streets and alleys. Pork and beef were out of stock for half a day. Those who understood a few words of Japanese made a fortune writing shop signs for others.</p>
<p>**Enemy Appeasement Policy - Like Sugar-Coated Arsenic**</p>
<p>The Japanese army issued its first proclamation, adopting a policy of appeasement, wanting to please the Chinese people, using both the Showa and the Republic of China year designations. It also declared that the Chinese were third parties, not enemies. However, the harassment by the Japanese army and the activities of secret agents were contrary to its proclamation, like poison in sugar-coated pills.</p>
<p>The declaration that 100-yuan and 500-yuan Hong Kong banknotes were temporarily suspended from circulation caused many people to frown, and they were forced to use "military currency." The ratio of military currency to Hong Kong dollars was one to two. Gloucester Building and the Hong Kong Hotel were the places where the Japanese chieftains operated and stayed. The so-called Hong Kong gentry were also forced to come out to maintain order. The common people suffered the most because the factories had already stopped working, and some savings had been used up. They dared not walk outside, fearing that they would be taken to do hard labor. Because the war had lasted for eighteen days, no one had cleaned the roads, garbage piled up, flies swarmed, and the stench was extreme. It was necessary to find coolies to clean it up. Many people threw anti-Japanese books and publications on the road, not daring to keep them, so the streets and alleys were full of filth.</p>
<p>Some people with a penchant for storytelling said that Hong Kong's eighteen days of fighting were predetermined. Because the Chinese character for "fragrant" (香) is a combination of the characters "one" (一), "ten" (十), "eight" (八), and "day" (日), this is another example of a clever play on words. I mention it in passing to end this article.</p>
<p>**Disbanding and Returning to the Fields**</p>
<p>A Japanese soldier in the midst of battle, his face overflowing with a joyful expression, helped his family harvest rice in the fields. However, you have to pay attention to the fact that he is still wearing the old work clothes from his military service. This is probably because he has no other clothes to change into. Since Allied Supreme Commander MacArthur ordered the disarmament of all Japanese troops, this uniform has probably been put down like a weapon.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Industry and Agriculture Support 40 Million People</h3>
<p>The Northeast has a large amount of raw materials, magnificent electricity, and developed railways and shipping lines, all of which are sufficient to support industrial production.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Northeast's agriculture, it is still the main resource of this region, and its importance is no less than that of industry. Since China has just been ravaged and agriculture is still awaiting revitalization, the Northeast's agriculture will be more necessary than industry in the next year or two. Northeast agriculture has been greatly developed by Japan, and it can now produce 3 million tons of wheat and about 5 million tons of soybeans annually. In addition, there is a large amount of rice, corn, millet, and sorghum.</p>
<p>In summary, the Northeast's industry and agriculture now support 40 million people, and its remaining capacity can still sustain the lives of 30 million people. Therefore, if China can manage it well, it can not only obtain food but also alleviate the difficulty of overpopulation. China may obtain raw materials to serve as the basis for developing inland industries, and in addition, it may obtain some machinery to be dismantled in Japan in the future. (New)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After Special Envoy Marshall Arrived in China</h3>
<p>President Truman's special envoy, Marshal Marshall, arrived in Shanghai by plane yesterday afternoon. General He Yingqin, former Chief of Staff of the Chinese Army, represented the government to greet him at Jiangwan Airport. At 6:00 PM, Mr. Marshall, introduced by General Wedemeyer, met with leaders of the Shanghai community at the Cathay Hotel, and they talked cordially with each other. Marshal Marshall is a first-rate military talent in the United States today, and he has a special mission to China this time. Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang have already flown to the capital one after another, and their meeting with Mr. Marshall will not be far off. Marshal Marshall has a deep understanding of the international situation. He must already have a clear idea of what the crux of the China problem is, and how he can accomplish his mission, and live up to the US President's desire to promote China's peace and unification. Standing on the position of a Chinese citizen, we feel both happy and ashamed to welcome Marshal Marshall today. However, as soon as Mr. Marshall got off the car, he widely solicited opinions, and we cannot but briefly state what we have in mind to help him have a better understanding of China. The current situation in China is somewhat similar to the early days of the founding of the United States. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, for fifty years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, have been striving to build a prosperous, happy, unified, and democratic China. Unfortunately, over the past thirty years, this nation-building work has been constantly hindered by Japanese imperialism and the division of local forces. The Chinese Kuomintang inherited the will of the Father of the Nation, launched the Northern Expedition, completed unification, and established the National Government. The invasion of Japan became even more urgent. Now that the enemy has surrendered, it is time for us to actively build the country, and our great ally has sent an envoy like Marshal Marshall to China, which truly reminds us of when France, whose nation-building ideals were similar to those of the United States, also sent an outstanding military and political figure to the United States at the beginning of the founding of the United States. We hope that the impact of Marshal Marshall's arrival in China can be the same as the impact of Lafayette on the American people. Modern democracy is a new experiment in China, and we need the assistance of allies who have experience in democratic politics and share our nation-building ideals, especially the assistance of a military genius with a democratic spirit like Marshal Marshall. We hope for the following points after Mr. Marshall's arrival in China:</p>
<p>First, President Truman's statement pointed out that the US government and the United Nations only recognize the National Government as the only legitimate government of China. This is what the Chinese people have always held, only recognizing the National Government as the only legitimate government. Therefore, future efforts should not be to weaken the power of the National Government, but to make it stronger; all efforts must be centered on the National Government, so that all parties tend towards this center, so that it becomes more stable and strengthened. The so-called "coalition government" that includes all parties and factions will only weaken the National Government, thinking of replacing the National Government with a new institution. This is contrary to the intentions of the general Chinese people, and is a conspiracy to deliberately distort President Truman's statement. The National Government's employment of people was originally not limited to members of the Kuomintang, and there are many talents who do not belong to the Kuomintang, and they sincerely welcome people from all parties and factions or no party. The reason why there are still political disputes is that there are some minorities who attempt to weaken or overthrow the existence of the National Government. Now that President Truman has issued his statement, and his special envoy Marshal Marshall has arrived in China, all efforts should be directed towards strengthening the National Government, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Second, the so-called "democracy" is seen differently by people with different ideals. China takes the Three Principles of the People as the highest principle for nation-building, which already contains the essence of Western democratic politics. Among them, the exercise of civil rights, such as initiation and referendum, are all systems adopted by the Father of the Nation after studying the application of American democratic politics. The experience of American democratic politics contributed greatly to the process of the Three Principles of the People. The common ground between the Chinese and American people in thought and behavior is probably more than any other nation. The Chinese people's respect for the tradition of freedom is no less than that of the American people. Because they love freedom, all forms of centralism or collectivism are not valued by the Chinese people. The development of the Chinese Communist Party in China relies on force, not on its doctrine, because the tradition of the Chinese people is incompatible with the so-called tradition of Marxism-Leninism. Not only do the Chinese see it this way, but the representative of the Third International, Joffe, made it clear when he came to China and issued a joint declaration with the Father of the Nation. And the Chinese Communist Party itself has long said that it is willing to fight for the Three Principles of the People, whether it is true or false, it can be seen that communism cannot be practiced in China, which is already known to all. Therefore, we cannot overestimate the strength of the Communist Party. At least, there are four to five million Catholic believers and one million Christian believers in China. Although they do not have a political organization, their ideals of life are fundamentally different from those of the so-called Marxists-Leninists. In short, in the process of democratization in China, the only means is not a new political experiment, but the full implementation of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Third, no country allows the existence of a state within a state and an independent and autonomous army. President Truman pointed out in his statement: "The existence of independent and autonomous armies like the Communist Party's army is incompatible with China's unification and makes political unification impossible." Therefore, in the process of building a strong, unified, and democratic China, the prerequisite, as the New York Times said, is that the Communist Party hand over its army. Because as long as an independent and autonomous army like the Communist Party's army exists, their attacks on the national army have not stopped for a day, and the occurrence of bloodshed in China cannot be ended for a day. In order to avoid bloodshed, for the sake of China's unification, and for the construction of a democratic China, the Communist Party's army should be immediately disbanded and reorganized. President Truman has a clear expression on this point, and it has almost become a foregone conclusion in China. We hope that it will be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We know that the convening of the Political Consultative Conference still needs to wait, and there is still no news about the meeting of the three-person group to resolve military issues. We sincerely hope that after Marshal Marshall's arrival in China, he will first promote the early holding of these two meetings.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Authorities Striving to Restore Private Trade - Granting Convenience and Assistance</h3>
<p>Reuter's Hong Kong 20th Telegram, Hong Kong Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Harcourt stated yesterday, emphasizing the necessity of restoring private trade in Hong Kong, and allowing various conveniences and assistance to be given to private business firms, so as to expand their activities. Companies that have not established an agent in Hong Kong may also be allowed to send representatives to Hong Kong. Although the Hong Kong government is engaged in purchasing some necessities, it does not oppose the import of supplementary goods by business firms. The distribution of local goods in Hong Kong should still be the responsibility of ordinary business firms. Foreign exchange control and the import permit system will soon be adopted.</p>

<p>Raw sugar produced in Taiwan, Fujian, Yiwu, and other places has begun to be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities. It is estimated that the average weekly arrival is more than 1,500 loads, while sales are less than half of the arrival. Therefore, the inventory has increased sharply.

<h3>Securities Black Market</h3>
<p>— Minor Recovery</p>
<p>Last month, on the 19th, a special decree from the Ministry of Finance ended the securities black market.</p>
<p>The securities market was originally an institution to attract floating capital and regulate enterprise finance. However, once it becomes a black market, it inevitably carries the danger of harboring dirt and filth. Moreover, the identities of the companies whose stocks are currently circulating on the market are still questionable. The exchange rate of valuable securities based on counterfeit currency is even more uncertain. Allowing them to circulate on the market would indeed hinder both political and economic orders.</p>
<p>Now, the black market is gone forever. Before "being summoned by the Lord," the money supply in the market was tight, and the black market call loan interest rate averaged over 20% per month. After "being summoned," the financial situation immediately eased, and the call loan interest rate gradually decreased, recently hovering around 12-13%. Although the tightening and loosening of the money supply have other causes, the demise of the stock market is not entirely unrelated.</p>
<p>Before its demise, the stock market concentrated on so-called "hot stocks." After its demise, floating capital suddenly favored government bonds. This shows that floating capital fears having no outlet. When neither east nor west is viable, changes are inevitable. Speculating in goods is outdated, and there are no stocks to manipulate. Legitimate business investment has not yet "become a trend." This floating capital, after rushing back and forth, chose government bonds. Although this is still a black market, it cannot be denied as a welcome phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, the black market's corpse is not yet cold, and another black market has already been born. This shows that economic issues cannot be completely resolved by political means. The current strategy for stabilizing prices should prioritize stabilizing the value of currency, followed by increasing the supply of goods, and thirdly, guiding floating capital towards savings and legitimate investment. Since the black market is illegal, there should be a legal alternative to replace it. Otherwise, backroom deals can transform into alleyway deals; alleyway deals can transform into teahouse deals; and teahouse deals can further transform into street deals. There is black within black, and law outside the law. Merely beautifying the surface is of no help.</p>
<p>The reorganization of the securities industry has already begun. However, all it has done is reorganize a group of securities practitioners. It has not reorganized the operating target of the securities industry—valuable securities. The Ministry of Economic Affairs still has no concrete measures for reorganizing companies issuing stocks based on counterfeit capital. The issues of resuming and reorganizing the stock exchange are still kept secret. I fear that after the pervasive "bearish mentality" passes, the rampant floating capital will indeed provoke change. "If it does not return to Mo, it will enter Yang." This cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Education and Sports</p>
<h3>Director Huang of the Department of Social Education Discusses National Education Rehabilitation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] National education rehabilitation work is actively underway. According to Huang Rujin, Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, the cost of rehabilitation and equipment enrichment for all levels of education nationwide is approximately 80 billion yuan, which does not include the rehabilitation expenses of various provinces. The central government has approved 1.1 billion yuan to assist provinces in rapid rehabilitation, to be used for urgent needs this year. The Ministry of Education had previously formulated a plan for the relocation sequence of schools in the rear areas, but due to transportation issues, it will be difficult to implement according to the original plan. Currently, most universities in the rear areas are preparing to relocate to their original sites starting in May or June next year. If transportation is smooth by then, the relocation may be completed at the beginning of the next academic year. As for national middle schools in the rear areas, which were temporarily established due to the war, the Ministry of Education has decided in principle to close all except for those in border areas, which will temporarily maintain their original status. The faculty, staff, and students of the closed schools will be distributed to various national schools according to their place of origin and aspirations. The funds will be transferred to the provincial education departments based on the number of classes of students distributed (50 students per class) for their use. The schools are currently conducting surveys and registration to establish standards for future distribution. The Ministry of Education will centrally provide travel expenses for faculty, staff, and their families.</p>
<h3>Deputy Minister of Education Hang Liwu Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Local News] Hang Liwu, Deputy Minister of Education, flew to Shanghai from Chongqing on the 17th and is residing at the office of the special envoy of the Ministry of Education for the Beijing-Shanghai region at 40 Yuyuan Road. He has been inspecting and guiding education rehabilitation in the city, working diligently. On the 19th, a reporter visited Deputy Minister Hang at his office on Yuyuan Road, where he made the following statement: "I am about to go to Beijing to arrange for the rehabilitation of the Ministry. I came to Shanghai first because I feel that the Shanghai education community was a center of arduous struggle during the war. I am here to visit and express my sympathy to people from all walks of life in education and culture. I am also planning to inspect the schools that have opened and the schools that are being rehabilitated."</p>
<h3>Education Association Actively Promotes School Building Protection Campaign</h3>
<p>[Local News] The city education association’s citywide campaign to protect school buildings is progressing actively. The latest developments in the campaign are: (1) The campaign was launched to relieve schools from pressure from landlords or occupation by troops. Schools that are suffering from these issues are requested to submit written reports to the association, which will provide practical assistance. (2) Regarding school building rents, they should not exceed 40 times the rent of 1937. The association has consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rent Commission and has decided to handle this matter thoroughly. (3) Landlords must not terminate leases or take back school buildings for their own use without reason. A request has been submitted to the government to include this point in a specific law. It is also learned that the association will make a solemn and effective representation regarding military occupation of school buildings that have not yet been vacated.</p>
<h3>British Aid for China's Nutritional Relief: Central University to Pilot</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing Airmail] British nutritional relief funds are planned to be piloted at Central University. The procedures have been decided: students from poor families with severed economic resources can apply with the certification of five other students who do not wish to apply for the relief funds. Consequently, over 600 people have registered to apply in recent days. The university plans to use these relief funds to subsidize some self-funded students. However, most students believe that the purpose of these relief funds is to improve the nutrition of Chinese students, and they should be used to improve the nutrition of all students. Subsidizing only a portion of the students goes against the original intention of the allied countries' aid. Therefore, they have risen in opposition and unanimously advocate that the relief funds should be distributed equally to all students in the dining halls for a "treat." The student union is currently negotiating with the university about this matter.</p>
<h3>Hankou Municipal Government Establishes Substitute National Schools</h3>
<p>Private Elementary Schools and Private Schools to be Closed by Deadline</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Hankou] The Hankou Municipal Government has noticed a recent increase in the population coming to Hankou from the rear areas, with a corresponding increase in the number of school-age children. To ensure that these children can enroll in school as much as possible, in addition to establishing 27 municipal elementary schools, it has promulgated a temporary method for establishing substitute national schools, which will be implemented immediately. The method provides detailed regulations for the funding, equipment, personnel, and curriculum of substitute national schools. All private elementary schools and private schools in the city must close by the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Inside American Universities: Hearing Children's Cries, Smelling Cooking</h3>
<p>[United Press, Newport, 19th] In the historic buildings of Yale University, one can now hear the cries of children and smell the aroma of cooking, seemingly adding a family atmosphere. The school's plan is to allow married veterans to return to school and continue their studies without disrupting their normal family life.</p>
<p>Veterans Bring Families to Live with Them</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this semester, 80 such veterans have brought their families to live in 17 specially renovated dormitories, and more than half of them have children. Veterans can receive government subsidies to return to school, which is already legally based, but the legislators did not anticipate the current housing shortage and high prices to such an extent. Therefore, Yale University intends to help implement this law. At the beginning of the fall semester, 600 veterans enrolled, and more than half were married. Counting those who had already enrolled in the previous semester, there were 800. University officials were overwhelmed because there were few vacant apartments in Newport to provide for returning veterans, not to mention students from out of state or their families.</p>
<p>Surviving the Housing Panic</p>
<p>According to Miller, who manages housing on campus, "The school's supply is far from ideal, but we have done everything we can in a short time. The school can barely help married students through the difficulties of the next two years, and we have to wait until the housing panic is resolved." However, the students are very supportive of this plan. One housewife said, "As a soldier's wife, I am already experienced. Before my husband deployed overseas, I always followed the barracks, moving east and west to take care of him and live with him. Now that we are at the university, this is the first time we can say it is our home." The amenities and rent in the dormitories vary depending on the building and room size. Each family usually has two or three rooms, but two families share a kitchen and bathroom. The rent ranges from $30 to $55.</p>
<p>Student Stipends Insufficient</p>
<p>The most expensive rent is for only two families, who occupy the entire top floor, with four private rooms, all utilities, heating, refrigerators, and the use of school furniture, such as tables, chairs, bookcases, beds, and bedding, included. Each student receives a monthly stipend of $75, which everyone feels is insufficient, so wives have to go out and find some work, which is especially difficult for those with children. A Senate subcommittee is currently considering increasing the stipend by $15, but even with the increase, most families still feel it is not enough because food costs $2 a day, which is $60 to $70 a month. And that's just calculating for those without children, so what can be done? One student said, "We can only use our previous savings, mortgage war bonds, or even borrow money." Atherton, who served as a Navy lieutenant in Europe, said, "I still have two years to get my engineering degree, and I have to take on $800 to $1,000 in debt each year. Sue is two and a half years old now, and Michael is just 15 months old. Don't think they don't add to my extra burden. Next spring, I can get some work, which will bring in $40 a month, but the situation is still dire." Everyone agrees that this is a difficult education, but everyone thinks it can be endured and is worth doing.</p>

<h3>Chengyou Team Basketball: Two Exciting Grade A Games Today; Xiexing and Shantou Teams Meet; Chengyou and Donghua have Similar Strength; Recent Trends have been Revealed</h3>
<p>The Chengyou Cup Grade A basketball competition has been underway for four weeks, with one month remaining. However, the division between strong and weak teams is already evident. In the first game today, Xiexing and Shantou will meet. Both are strong teams. Shantou has won all four of its games, maintaining a winning record. Players like Chen Qingjiang, Ma Canxi, and Lin Weicong are top-notch players in Shanghai. The team's cooperation is also better than other teams, and they have great ambitions for this cup competition. Xiexing has played five games, winning four and losing only one to Hualian. However, recently, He Jingui and Li Ruixiong, former members of the South China team, have joined, adding to their strength. If they can manage their lineup effectively today, Shantou may not be so optimistic. In short, this game is very important for the Grade A championship.</p>
<p>In the second game, Donghua and Chengyou have similar strength. Donghua has physical strength, while Chengyou has a good spirit. Both sides have well-known players with experienced skills. A fierce battle is inevitable. The schedule for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Xiexing vs. Shantou (Grade A) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Chengyou vs. Donghua (Grade A) 6:30 PM</p>

<h3>The People's Food Problem</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yuanrou</p>
<p>As someone engaged in people's education work, I have personally visited the people to encourage them to learn. Many people have given us such answers: "I work in the fields all day long, where do I have time to study!" "Prices are so high, life is so difficult, if I study, won't I have to eat food? It doesn't matter if I don't know how to read, you teachers are really meddling!"</p>
<p>In fact, the hardworking people, why don't they want to study! Why don't they know the benefits of studying! But they don't have this fortune, they must do hard work, their stomachs cannot be discounted!</p>
<p>I feel that: (1) When doing people's education, we should not forget the people's food problem; if we break the people's rice bowls and force them to come to class to learn to read, it is absolutely impossible! (2) Education is aimed at improving life; we should find ways to improve their living skills, and then teach the people to read and read newspapers, that is true people's education. In short, doing people's education should start with improving the people's livelihood!</p>

<h3>The High Court Re-examines Traitor Ling Guangyan Yesterday at the Detention Center</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The traitor Ling Guangyan was re-examined at 2:30 PM yesterday at the Shanghai Prison High Court detention center. The presiding judge was Liu Yugui, with Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, Judges Zhu Zonghai and Cao Jun, and Secretary Jin Guoliang in attendance.</p>
<p>Previous Puppet Positions</p>
<p>Prosecutor Lin first read out the main points of the indictment, stating: The defendant participated in the puppet government in the autumn of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], serving as an "Inspector of the Ministry of Internal Affairs." In the winter of the same year, he served as an "Inspector of the Anhui Provincial Government," and in the spring of the 28th year [1939] as a "Secretary of the Pacification Department." In the autumn of the 29th year [1940], he served as a "Colonel Advisor to the Reorganized 10th Army Division," and in the spring of the 30th year [1941] as a "Major General Deputy Brigade Commander of the 20th Brigade." In the spring of the 31st year [1942], he served as a "Military Supervisor of the Pacification Army," and in the spring of the 33rd year [1944] as a "Military Judge of the Xiwuchengqing Rural Command." In the summer of the same year, he also served as a "Colonel Advisor to the Second Army." In summary, the defendant participated in the puppet government, holding various military and political positions for six years. Although he repeatedly claimed it was due to enemy coercion, there is no reason why he could not have escaped after so long. Therefore, the defendant is guilty of colluding with the enemy to betray the country, as per Article 2, Section 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Although the defendant surrendered himself to the Shanghai Military Police, it does not meet the requirements stipulated in the Regulations for the Surrender of Traitors. The court is requested to severely punish him according to the law.</p>
<p>Attempting to Evade Guilt</p>
<p>Before Prosecutor Lin read the indictment, the traitor Ling Guangyan attempted to state his reasons first, but was reprimanded in court by Judge Liu. Ling then stated his defense, saying he is 38 years old, from Wujiang, Jiangsu. He graduated from Chizhi University in his early years and later studied in Paris. Before the war, he went to Japan in a private capacity to study commercial law. He taught in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he participated in guerrilla work in his hometown, serving as the director of a political training class. He was denounced, leading him to turn to the enemy. Ling claimed that while he held various puppet positions, it was all due to the pressure of the environment, but he always "worked for the benefit of the people." In particular, when the traitor Li Shiqun and the Japanese Navy Marines carried out a rural pacification campaign in the Luli area, he tried to prevent a Japanese massacre. He also assisted the rearguard of the Loyal Salvation Army when it withdrew from Wujiang and was surrounded by the Japanese. He made every effort to relieve the siege. When he served as the "Deputy Brigade Commander of the 20th Brigade," he repeatedly assisted guerrilla work, which was why he was envied by the Japanese. As a result, he was arrested by the Japanese Military Police many times and suffered inhumane torture. This proves that the defendant had no intention of colluding to betray the country. He also stated that after the "20th Brigade" was completely disarmed by the Japanese army in September of the 32nd year [1943], he knew that the Japanese were faithless and unjust. Ling finally requested that two witnesses in Suzhou be summoned. At 3:01 PM, Judge Liu ordered the witnesses to be summoned and scheduled a retrial.</p>
<h3>Most of the Received Japanese and Puppet Ships Need Repair</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to information obtained from the National Ship Allocation Committee of the Ministry of Transportation, China has received over 2,700 Japanese and puppet ships to date. The largest ships have over 4,000 tons, but most of the ships have damaged or missing parts and need to be repaired before they can be used. It is reported that the ships allocated by the Committee currently operating on the Yangtze River include 20 ships on the Chongqing-Yichang line, 20 ships on the Yichang-Hankou line, and 26 ships on the Hankou-Shanghai line, totaling 66 ships. The allocation of ships for foreign waters has not yet been finalized. It is reported that several ships have sailed to the Northeast and Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Application for the Return of Radios Purchased Under Duress</h3>
<p>Radios and shortwave radios that were purchased under duress by the enemy and puppet regimes have been seized and are being kept by the enemy and puppet property handling office. Owners can apply to the responsible department with their certificates for their return. However, the total number of shortwave radios is about 15,000, some of which have been transported elsewhere and are currently being tracked down.</p>
<h3>Strict Investigation of Japanese Residents' Household Registration, Issuance of Identification Cards</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly investigate the identities of Japanese residents, the Japanese Residents Management Office, together with the military police, conducted a strict investigation of the household registration of Japanese residents in the concentration area yesterday. The investigation was divided into 30 groups and carried out simultaneously. It is scheduled to be completed within today and tomorrow, after which Japanese identification cards will be issued. Wang, Director of the Japanese Residents Management Office, and Deputy Director Zou, personally inspected the various locations yesterday.</p>
<h3>Relief Supplies Transported from Shanghai to Various Locations</h3>
<p>Food, clothing, and other supplies shipped to Shanghai by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) have temporarily filled the wharves and warehouses. They have now begun to be transported to inland cities and coastal areas in dire need of relief. The first nine ships that arrived unloaded 76,000 tons of goods, mostly food. Two more ships are currently unloading. Of the above-mentioned 76,000 tons, all have been moved out of the brick yards, with the exception of 11,000 tons still in warehouses. The remainder has been distributed to distribution stations in Hankou, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Kowloon. Some of the flour has been distributed to bakeries, retailers, and flour mills in this city. Some has also been sold to the Kailuan Coal Mining Company near Tianjin, which is paying workers with flour, resulting in a doubling of coal production. Another 20,000 tons will be shipped out of Shanghai in the next two weeks. Negotiations are underway with three shipping companies to lease 20 inland and seagoing ships to facilitate transportation. UNRRA relief food is distributed by 15 district offices. In large-scale public works projects, it is distributed free of charge to workers. In areas where food is scarce but people still have purchasing power, it is sold at a fixed price. The proceeds will be used for direct relief or to send refugees back to their hometowns. Many foreign refugees, mostly Jews, are currently receiving UNRRA relief. Several hundred more have registered with UNRRA, hoping to be repatriated with its assistance.</p>

<h3>Welcoming Marshall – An Unprecedented Scene at Jiangwan Airport</h3>
<p>— Shouren</p>
<p>The welcome for U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall at Jiangwan Airport yesterday was the grandest scene seen since the victory. According to the scheduled plan, Marshall was set to arrive at the airport after one o'clock. The U.S. military press liaison officer prepared ten trucks and two cars at 11:00 AM to transport local news reporters to Jiangwan to greet him. At 11:45 AM, the "reporter's car" departed from Fuzhou Road, fully loaded with more than forty reporters. The U.S. military authorities were very strict, and temporary reporter identification cards were issued. Those without identification were not allowed to enter. Along Jiangwan Road, soldiers of the New Sixth Army could be seen, holding guns and guarding the posts.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Commander-in-Chief He</p>
<p>Upon entering the airport, U.S. military police wearing white helmets were guarding various locations. Marshall's black car was already parked on the runway, with eight white military police motorcycles parked in front to clear the way. At a little after one o'clock, a black car drove into the airport. The reporters all knew that it was Mayor Qian's car, but to their surprise, the first person to get out was Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin. Those present had not received news of Commander-in-Chief He's arrival in Shanghai, so they were all a little surprised to see him. The reporters surrounded He, asking various questions and requesting answers. He smiled and said, "I am a soldier, I don't understand political questions." He was very amiable to the reporters. Some said, "Commander-in-Chief He has a bit of an 'American style' with reporters and is very popular with journalists."</p>
<p>Cameras Focus on Marshall</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai arrived latest among those who welcomed him at the airport. He was wearing a large black cloak and a black hood, and he was chatting very enthusiastically with those present. At a little after one o'clock, the reporters were confined to the designated area. Only ten photography reporters had special permission to work outside the area. A foreign reporter who had just arrived from Tokyo said that when General MacArthur flew into Tokyo, there was no scene as grand as yesterday's welcome for Marshall. At 1:40 PM, the sound of engines could be heard in the sky. A few minutes later, Marshall's silver plane was spotted circling overhead. Shortly after, it landed at the end of the runway. The plane, led by jeeps, slowly drove to the designated disembarkation point. As soon as the plane door opened, Marshall got out. Although he was over sixty years old, his steps were nimble, fully showing that he was a soldier. As Marshall got off the plane, the U.S. military band played the Chinese and American national anthems. Marshall and General Wedemeyer stood at attention and saluted. At this moment, ten photography reporters and ten cameras simultaneously advanced on Marshall. The reporters inside the area were also busy finding angles to photograph Marshall. This grand welcoming event, including Marshall getting off the plane, the playing of music, and the inspection, only lasted a little over ten minutes. After shaking hands with the welcoming personnel, Marshall got into the car and drove away.</p>
<p>Sign the Banknotes</p>
<p>At the cocktail party held at the Cathay Hotel in the evening, there were four or five hundred people in attendance. Marshall, General Wedemeyer, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Robert Smith, Military Attaché Colonel Barr, and Marshall's personal secretary Xue Bulai, stood in a row at the door, shaking hands with the guests one by one. Almost all of Shanghai's Chinese and American leaders were present. Not long after, Marshall came over and spoke with Commander-in-Chief He for a while, and they raised their glasses to wish each other health. At the reception, Commander-in-Chief He and U.S. Minister to the Philippines McNutt were surrounded by reporters. Several reporters even took out brand new banknotes and asked Commander-in-Chief He, Marshall, McNutt, and Wedemeyer to sign them as souvenirs.</p>
<p>Marshall's contribution to China and the world is significant. The grand welcome from Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai yesterday was sincere and heartfelt. It is hoped that the cooperation between China and the United States can be furthered by Marshall's appointment as special envoy, and that more solid guarantees can be obtained for the permanent peace of the world.</p>
<h3>Starting in Mid-January Next Year, More Express Trains Will Be Added to the Nanjing-Shanghai Line; New Passenger Cars and Touring Cars Will Be Added</h3>
<p>According to a responsible person from the Transportation Department of the China Railway Management Committee of the Ministry of Transportation, the 20 locomotives and 3,000 freight car materials shipped from the United States to Shanghai will be allocated to the Ministry of Transportation by the UNRRA after their arrival in Shanghai. A considerable number can be allocated to the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, which will greatly benefit the freight transportation on the two lines. Recently, passenger transportation has still been crowded. At present, the slightly damaged passenger cars are being actively repaired. It is expected that an additional special express train will be added around January 10th next year, from Shanghai to Changzhou or Nanjing, to facilitate passenger transportation between Nanjing and Shanghai. The Committee has formulated a concrete plan to modernize passenger transport on various lines in Central China, which will add 191 of the newest passenger cars. The newest American-style touring cars are also being added. The upper half of these touring cars is made of glass, which is extremely convenient for passengers to view the scenery around them. The cars are also equipped with air conditioners, which can adjust the temperature inside the cars to make the temperature comfortable and increase the pleasure of traveling.</p>
<h3>Association of War-Stricken Comrades Performs Plays to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Association of War-Stricken Comrades has been working very actively. In order to raise funds for various relief projects to help injured and sick comrades, children who have dropped out of school, and unemployed colleagues, a three-day Peking opera performance will be held at the Tianchan Stage starting today. Participants are well-known opera singers and celebrities in this city, performing their most proud and wonderful plays. Performances start at 5:30 PM every day. It is said that ticket prices have been set at 10,000, 6,000, 4,000, 2,000, and 1,000. Ticket sales started on the 18th. It is also said that the association has printed a kind of honorary ticket of 50,000 yuan, which has been enthusiastically promoted by the general manager Wan Molin and others, and has been mostly sold out.</p>
<h3>Cai Zhengya Discusses Commodity Prices - A Fixed Exchange Rate is Needed First</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Commodity prices in this city have recently shown a tendency to rise again. Yesterday, the reporter especially visited Cai Zhengya, Director of the Economic Research Office of the Municipal Government, who analyzed the price trend as follows: Cai said that after Japan's surrender, the multiple by which prices have risen is even higher than before the victory. Factors such as the conversion rate of puppet currency, factory shutdowns, traffic obstructions, and poor administrative facilities are the main reasons, and then it has been affected by the soaring of the U.S. dollar. The highest peak of the U.S. dollar gold was on November 1, and the highest peak of daily necessities was on November 27. Afterwards, it gradually decreased, sometimes fluctuating, but always rising and falling with the U.S. dollar, and people's anxiety also played a big part. Therefore, if one wants to stabilize commodity prices at present, the first thing is to determine an appropriate exchange rate, and the second is to stabilize people's minds. If the supply and demand are occasionally insufficient, enemy and puppet materials can be sold at a flat price, which will surely be effective, but the technical problems of flat sales must be improved. If commodity prices fall, flat sales will be in vain. It is necessary to wait for them to move and then quickly sell them at a flat price in large quantities, which will surely maintain the expected level. It is also necessary to ensure that the goods sold at a flat price can directly enter the hands of consumers, so as not to flow into the hands of hoarders. In this way, natural factors will not be a problem, and commodity prices will not rise sharply again.</p>
<h3>Ticket Merchants Must Sign Their Own Names When Purchasing China Merchants Bureau Ship Tickets</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The "scalpers" who were extremely active during the war, specializing in black market train and ship tickets, have once again become active. In order to prevent this, the China Merchants Bureau has now stipulated that anyone purchasing a ticket must sign their name or affix their seal on the back of the ticket when purchasing it. When checking the ticket, they must sign their name or affix their seal again. If any discrepancy is found, they will not be allowed to board the ship. Passengers lining up to purchase train tickets in front of the China Travel Service are first issued numbers by the company, and then purchase tickets according to the numbers, but there are even "scalpers" who line up in advance, obtain these numbers, and then sell them to later passengers at high prices.</p>

<h3>Police and Bandits Shoot Last Night, One Bandit Killed, One Wounded</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 6:00 PM last night, police officers Xu Xuebo and Yu Yan from the Taishan Precinct led four police officers to search pedestrians within their jurisdiction. When they arrived at the intersection of Caishi Street East and Zilaihuo Street, they were suddenly confronted by three people, all wearing black robes, who shouted to stop for inspection. However, the suspects were suspicious, turned around and fled. One of them pulled out a pistol and opened fire on the police officers. The police officers drew their guns and fired back. The two sides exchanged fire more than ten times. As a result, the first bandit to open fire was shot twice in the arm. Police officer Xu Xuebo bravely rushed forward and lay down beside a telephone pole on the side of the road. He continued to fire one shot, hitting the bandit in the chest, causing him to fall to the ground and die. At the same time, police officer Yu Yan also captured one bandit, who confessed his name as Pan Zhixiang. He was planning to rob elsewhere. The remaining bandit escaped without a trace.</p>
<h3>Qingtian Street Robbery Case Solved Within Three Hours</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 8:00 PM on the evening of the 19th, three robbers wearing uniforms broke into the home of a Shaoxing woman, Liang Ma, at No. 11 Chunyuan Lane, Qingyun Street, inside the city. Under the pretext of searching, they robbed her of three gold bracelets, a gold watch, and some legal currency and Central Reserve Coupons, totaling a loss of more than three million yuan. When the robbers fled, the victim followed behind and shouted loudly. Hearing the alarm, the nearby police officers quickly gathered and captured the petty criminal Sheng Zhihong (from Tianjin, 17 years old), who had previously served in the Tax Police Corps. He was taken to the Yimiao Precinct. After interrogation, he confessed that there were still accomplices hiding at No. 96 Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road. Police officers went to the address and arrested the major robbers Ma Buqing and Li Zhenyi and eight others, and confiscated guns and bullets. The nine robbers are continuing to be interrogated. It took only three hours from the occurrence of the case to its solution. It was learned afterwards that all the robbers were former puppet tax police soldiers.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery Attempt: Thugs Immediately Arrested</h3>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) At approximately 8 PM on the 28th of last month, Zhu Hongming, Tang Bingyun, Xu Chengmo, and three others, armed, suddenly arrived at the Monte Carlo West Bar at 471 Dongda Ming Road. Claiming to be members of the Chinese Investigation Bureau's Detective Team, they stated they were acting on orders, alleging the shop harbored Japanese political prisoners. They came and went three times but conducted no investigation and seemed extremely flustered. The shop owner, finding them suspicious, reported this to the Tilanqiao Branch Bureau. Upon receiving the report, Director Zhang, suspecting the group, instructed the Judicial Section Chief Shi Qingrong to dispatch two plainclothes police officers to secretly observe the shop. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, the three individuals returned. Seeing they were of ill repute, the plainclothes officers apprehended them all. Two handguns and twelve bullets were seized on the spot. They confessed to planning an armed robbery. They also confessed to robbing a certain family at No. 2, Lane 225, Qiujiang Road, taking over 200,000 yuan in legal tender, along with clothing and numerous other items. After preliminary examination by the Branch Bureau, they have been transferred to the local Procuratorate for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Remembering Wang Lixi</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>A kind, sincere, enthusiastic, and affable great writer has been dead for six years, serving in the war of resistance. He couldn't see victory, couldn't see peace, could only smile in heaven, perhaps with a slight resentment.</p>
<p>I still remember six years ago, at the anniversary banquet of the National Literary and Art Circles' Association for Resistance Against the Enemy, Lixi, his wife Jingqing, and I were at the same table. Because Jingqing could drink, we formed a battle line with Lu Jiye and engaged in a fierce battle with Hong Shen at another table. In the end, we won, but I also got drunk. I left the restaurant dazed and staggered down the road. If it hadn't been for Lixi supporting me, I don't know where I would have ended up drunk. His gentle nature made Jingqing seem more masculine, while he seemed more feminine. Soon after, I invited them to meet at the Sheng Sheng Garden. This time, Lixi himself got drunk, intoxicated by the evening scenery of the Jialing River. I had to hire a car to drag him back, while Jingqing had to leave early due to other matters. Walking on the dark Shangqing Temple Road, he told me that he recently intended to go to the front line, unwilling to suffer slow torment. His excited back disappeared into the flying sadness of Benzi.</p>
<p>In the bloody "May Third" and "May Fourth" of the twenty-eighth year, the surge of every patriot's blood was aroused. Who could remain silent and tolerate it any longer? Thus, the "Writer's Visiting Group" was formed in this blood's frenzy! We, the younger group, unanimously elected the kind and experienced Lixi to lead.</p>
<p>The date and procedures for departure had been decided, but my work didn't allow for leave. But he encouraged me to go, saying, "You said you wanted to go to the front a long time ago, and E'e can't go because of illness. If you don't go, there will be no women at all. You should try your best to find a way."</p>
<p>Leave was impossible to get. Lao She also thought that my health was too poor, and wouldn't it burden the group if I got sick? Lixi also noticed this point, and he said with a warning:</p>
<p>"At the front, if there's no transportation, you have to walk, and you can't worry about storms. Only strong people can endure this kind of hardship, and the group's discipline doesn't allow for leaving halfway. Can you bear it? A physique like mine can handle it!" He patted his chest, looking very self-satisfied, and looked at me with sympathetic eyes. This made me helplessly nod to him, indicating that I accepted his words, and asked to be kept informed.</p>
<p>After I decided not to go, Jingqing didn't approve. She repeatedly asked me to go. I knew her selfish motive: she wanted to be with me, so she wouldn't be separated from Lixi. But in the end, I couldn't go, and Jingqing couldn't go either. I went back to Beibei Hot Springs, and they separated north and south. This entanglement was originally not my responsibility, but unexpectedly, the news of "Lixi's death" came, which inevitably made me blame myself. I thought almost every day, if I had participated in the visiting group, and Jingqing had gone with us, and we were all together, his illness might have been cured. Even if he still had to die, at least Jingqing could have been closer to him for a little longer! Thinking like this, I couldn't help but shed tears. Thinking like this, I felt a kind of uneasy guilt. But in fact, Lixi would never pat his chest again and say that his body could handle it. He would never be able to come back.</p>
<p>Even now, I still can't believe that Lixi has really let go of everything! He had such a strong and mighty physique, such a courageous soul, such a sincere and enthusiastic character, and his kind deeds. With these qualities, he shouldn't have died, he wouldn't have died. I firmly believe that, even now.</p>
<p>Yes, national warriors will not die, especially Lixi. His spirit will live immortally in people's hearts, in the history of the motherland!</p>
<h3>Allusion and Antithesis</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Those who advocated for the literary revolution in the past had eight "don'ts", one of which was not to use allusions. But in my opinion, using allusions does not hinder the article itself, only whether it is used properly and whether it is too obscure to be understood. If used appropriately, it can help with the liveliness of the article and the clarity of the language. Now I excerpt a farewell poem by Qiu Canghai (Fengjia) to Wang Songchen returning to Taiwan, which can show a glimpse of this. The original poem says:</p>
<p>"I only wish you were like the moon in the sky, rising from the sea and returning to the east: I don't wish you were like the water flowing eastward, never returning from the sea. The moon has affection, the water is heartless, a dim soul melts away in farewell. Moreover, the family is separated like Hu and Yue, leaving their hometown for a hundred years. Doors are closed to wild geese, rivers block carp, ten thousand gold cannot buy a single letter. Alas, distant traveler, set off in the spring breeze of March. Cannot be retained, the sound of the Xiao flute, cannot be wiped away, the name on the jade. Thousands of dusts and kalpas cannot grind it away, the falling moon on the roof beam is the sorrow of parting. The mountain is always green, but it does not become clear after leaving the mountain; the moon in the sea comes out of the water and becomes bright again. I do not regret your distant farewell, I regret your long and final separation. To know whether you will come back, look at the full moon again."</p>
<p>This poem has only thirteen rhymes. A total of eight allusions are used, all of which are exceptionally appropriate, natural, and common, and each has a deep meaning embedded in it. If we know Qiu Canghai's life experience, we will surely feel that his verses are deeply emotional. This is because Qiu was a national hero and patriotic poet who launched the anti-Japanese militia in Taiwan.</p>
<p>If the use of allusions in writing can be appropriate, clear, natural, common, and have hidden meaning, or even possess all five aspects, then his article will be full of vitality. Otherwise, it will be fragmented, obscure, and leave traces, just showing off talent, which is useless and only leads to criticism. In the history of literature, folk songs, such as the song of hitting the earth in Yao's time (some say it was forged by later generations), "Rising at sunrise, resting at sunset, digging wells to drink, plowing fields to eat," is also very natural in its antithesis. The south wind song in Shun's time, the crow magpie song of He, the wife of the retainer of King Kang of Song, the generous song of You Meng, which was revised by the people of Chu, and the Book of Changes, Rites, and Spring and Autumn, also have many antithetical phrases. Others, such as the poems of the Tang and Song dynasties, also have many antitheses. Even Xiang Yu's saying, "Power to lift mountains, spirit to cover the world, the time is unfavorable, the steed does not go," is also particularly neat in its parallelism.</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I am reminded of clichés. In announcements of mourning, it is always said that one is "delirious on a pillow of earth." A horizontal plaque is sent to a doctor, not "bringing spring to life," but "skilled in Qihuang." A thousand articles are the same, flattering and deceiving oneself and others. And those who are just beginning to write vernacular, when describing the sky, must use azure, and when describing the efforts of laborers, they often use "kang yu" (resistance to breeding), which is also the same cliché. In fact, the most important thing in an article is the content and fluency of the sentences. Other things, such as the use of allusions and antithesis, can sometimes be inserted to catch the reader's eye and make it seem a bit more interesting.</p>
<h3>"Ensemble" and "Harmony"</h3>
<p>— Song Chang</p>
<p>The orchestra (Orchestra) is the largest and most complete organization of musical instruments. Because the orchestra includes many instruments, it uses the timbres of various types of instruments to compose, so the volume is large and the expressive power is also very rich. Each instrument is a living, personalized individual, and performing it is almost like a performance of a grand musical drama (Drama).</p>
<p>The orchestra is so complex and intricate, why can it be cleverly coordinated to complete a good effect? This reason lies entirely in the element of harmony. The element of harmony can be said to be the foundation of music. Although each instrument has different characteristics, different timbres, and special emotions, they must all abide by the conditions of harmony. Only in this way can they cooperate and show a spirit of coordination.</p>
<p>I think music is like this, and a group, a country is also like this. Our country is now moving from the period of tutelage to the period of constitutional government. We are looking forward to the realization of democratic politics and the completion of the great cause of nation-building. Each party and faction is a group of political opinions, and naturally each has its own views, but for the sake of the country, we should unite together under the common belief of the Three Principles of the People, like the ensemble of an orchestra, and obtain perfect "harmony" through the cooperative "ensemble".</p>
<h3>A Heartbreaking Affair</h3>
<p>— Shangguan Shen</p>
<p>Yesterday, for an urgent matter, I hurriedly got on a pedicab to go to my destination. The morning wind was a bit cold, and I turned up my coat collar.</p>
<p>The driver was pedaling very slowly, his body bent forward, and he was constantly coughing.</p>
<p>He was wearing an old Western suit jacket, with a hole in the elbow, revealing the dirty flannel shirt underneath. The pants were Chinese-style lined pants. His hair was very long, as if he hadn't had a haircut for a month.</p>
<p>After pedaling about halfway, I saw him pedaling slower and slower. The pedicab behind me had also overtaken me. I looked at my watch and it was already past the time I had agreed to. The driver was still pedaling slowly, one step at a time, as if he was pushing. I became annoyed and urged him.</p>
<p>He didn't answer me, he just pedaled harder, but after walking a short distance, he immediately slowed down again. I stamped my feet on the footboard, urging him.</p>
<p>He wanted to defend himself, "I..." but he didn't say anything. He lowered his body and pedaled forward desperately, but immediately slowed down again as if he couldn't hold on.</p>
<p>I almost wanted to scold him. I shouted for him to stop the car. I jumped out of the car, intending to pay him half the agreed fare. When I was counting the money and glaring at him angrily, I was stunned. The weak and pitiful driver standing in front of me was a good classmate of mine from elementary school. My face immediately flushed, and I was very embarrassed and didn't know what to do. He silently lowered his head and didn't look at me.</p>
<p>I called out his name softly. He seemed unable to bear the shame and turned to leave. I immediately realized that I had hurt his self-esteem. He obviously didn't want to admit it to me. I quickly caught up with him and stuffed all the money in my hand to him, but he called me from behind, came over and returned the money to me, and said in a very low voice, "You gave me too much."</p>
<p>He left. I looked at his back, and I felt a burst of heartbreak! We used to be friends, everything was the same, but now, one takes a car, one pedals a car. I gave him extra money with apology, but he returned it to me and said, "You gave me too much," treating me completely as a stranger.</p>
<p>I was silent for a whole day...</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn Essays</p>
<h3>Old Stories</h3>
<p>— Murong Sui</p>
<p>This is a very ordinary old story:</p>
<p>An inspection team went to a small town in our hometown to conduct an inspection. The local government carefully sent two guards and hired rickshaws to lead them to inspect the town. As a result, they felt the impression was extremely good!</p>
<p>But they cleverly felt that it was not enough to only inspect the town area. They also discussed with the people in the government to go to the countryside to conduct an inspection. Of course, they were still carefully sent to go. After the result of "Respecting cigarettes in the east village" and "Waiting for tea in the west village", the impression was not bad.</p>
<p>They left. When the villagers went to the street, everyone talked about this and said, "They are just inspecting and inspecting, at most they are just visiting. They are not like Shi Gong and Bao Gong privately visiting the countryside to investigate. What are they doing?"</p>
<p>Here is another very ordinary old story:</p>
<p>A certain visiting group went to a certain town. The local groups held a large joint reception. The visiting group wanted to know more about the local situation in detail, and asked the representatives of each group in detail. Of course, each representative answered truthfully.</p>
<p>But when this visiting group was about to leave, they hired a few porters. Unexpectedly, the porters on the road instead asked the visiting group, "Sir! When can we buy cheap cloth in this town? When can we eat the allocated rice and salt?" The visiting group then felt a little "茫然" (mángrán - at a loss) or "恍然" (huǎngrán - suddenly realized)!</p>
<p>This is just an old story! Of course, it is not the same as before. Many senior officials who care about the people's plight must be able to go deep into the people. They will definitely not be like ordinary villagers who are thinking about those outdated "Bao Gong cases" and "Shi Gong cases".</p>
<h3>White Horse Temple (Temple is in Luoyang)</h3>
<p>— Lao She</p>
<p>The Central Plains was originally good soil; the White Horse carried the scriptures. Wild cranes heard the first chants, bright clouds shone on the ancient platform. Sparse bells, silent among the graves, a dream opening up ten thousand fortunes. Calamities are still as they were in the past, burning incense to understand the Buddha's grief! Huang Yifei</p>

<h3>Proposing Suggestions to the Public Works Bureau; Hasten the Construction of Caojiadu Bridge According to the Original Plan Before the War</h3>
<p>— Huang Yifei</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has been actively repairing roads. The main roads in the central urban area have already been completed. The northern end of Yinxiang Road and the section of North Sichuan Road near the railway will also be completed soon. Jiangsu Road, etc., in the urban area will also be completely renovated. This very correct inspiration deserves our support and praise. What we feel most headache about is the cliché of "only hearing the sound of the stairs, but not seeing anyone coming down." Because traffic problems, the big ones are related to the future of nation-building, and the small ones are related to social tranquility; next year is the implementation period of the traffic movement, the author cannot ignore this new measure, and from time to time puts forward a traffic problem in the western district of Shanghai for the reference of the Municipal Public Works Bureau.</p>
<p>Taking western Shanghai as an example, Caojiadu is an important hub for Jiading Nanxiang Zhenru and other places. The source of Shanghai's vegetables is mostly imported from the western district of Shanghai, partly by boat transportation and partly by land transportation. Let's not talk about boat transportation for the time being; first, pay attention to land transportation, and we have to pay attention to a Caojiadu bridge. The damage is unimaginable. If a heavy vehicle passes through, it shakes all over, which is extremely dangerous. Secondly, the southern end of the bridge is obstructed by houses, so cargo-carrying factories and cargo-carrying heavy grass often have the danger of being hit and falling into the river. It is reported that around 1937, the municipal government built this bridge. The original plan was to remove all the obstructing houses. The bridge was made of steel frame, but due to the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, it was perfunctory. Now, traffic members are looking forward to the Public Works Bureau rebuilding the Caojiadu Bridge according to the original plan of the municipal government before the war, demolishing the obstructing houses at the bridge end, opening up roads, so that the traffic inside and outside the city is smooth and convenient, and the citizens will benefit infinitely!</p>

<h3>A Discussion on Freedom from Worry Regarding Lung Disease (4)</h3>
<p>(8) Compressing Lesions as a Fundamental Treatment for Lung Disease</p>
<p>If compression therapy can be applied early in lung disease to eradicate lesions, it is indeed a fundamental treatment. This not only saves economic resources and time but also allows for an early return to health, enabling individuals to engage in production, benefiting both their families and society. Among modern compression therapies, the most widely applied is artificial pneumothorax, commonly known as "air injection," which involves injecting gas into the pleural cavity. The lungs, within the chest cavity, are not adhered to the chest wall. Both their surface and the inner surface of the chest wall are covered by a smooth membrane, creating a separate cavity between them. Injecting gas into this space creates an artificial pneumothorax, causing the diseased part of the lung to be compressed and shrink, becoming quiescent. This reduces tension and provides an opportunity for rest, making the disease easier to cure. If there are already cavities in the lungs, these cavities can also shrink, allowing the surrounding tissues to close tightly, and gradually disappear due to the proliferation of new tissue. Furthermore, the compression of the lesions slows blood flow, and encourages the accumulation of lymph fluid. This can stop bleeding in the affected area, prevent the spread of tuberculosis bacteria within the patient, or to others, and reduce the absorption of tuberculosis toxins. Therefore, the most obvious and earliest benefits that patients experience after undergoing artificial pneumothorax are the cessation of hemoptysis (coughing up blood), a rapid decrease in hectic fever, the disappearance of tuberculosis bacteria in sputum, gradual weight gain, and an improved overall condition. Therefore, artificial pneumothorax is indeed a fundamental treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, suitable for individuals of all ages, without causing any pain. Notably, it allows patients to continue working as usual during the treatment period.</p>
