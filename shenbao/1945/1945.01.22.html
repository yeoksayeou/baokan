<h3>八六屆會議重開　日首相披瀝決意　推行決戰施策爭最後勝利</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日第八十六屆議會，於二十一日再開，上午十時貴族院首開全體會議，由法川　長就前此十五日以敵機來襲　受大神宮域，謹代表貴族院晋宮參內，恭請聖安，並參入大宮恭候皇太后陛下聖安，並加以報吿。諸般報告依次完畢，由小磯首相登幕演說施政方針，　由　光外相登　　明外交方針，嗣後入於　程，提出恩給法中改正法律案（政府提出），及另一法律案，由三浦法制局長官說明提案理由，交特別委員會，至十一時二十分散會。</p>
<p>小磯首相演辭全文</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日第八十六届議會席上，小磯首相施政演說要旨誌次：今戰局進展益趨積極，皇國此次遭遇大東亞戰爭勃發以來最重大之局面，已至興廢之關頭。去秋帝國陸海軍以敵企圖進攻，乃在合灣及菲律賓海上予以邀擊，已獲空前大捷，而敵雖負此重創，在豐富物量援護之下，於　伊泰島登陸，　之侵攻明多羅島，至今敵以數師團之兵力在呂宋島登陸，故形勢愈趨重大。</p>
<p>發揮特攻精神　把握制勝良機</p>
<p>皇軍將兵自敵軍進攻菲律賓以來。即湧起擁護國體之熱烈氣魄。全員悉數化爲特別攻擊隊，或勇敢猛撞敵艦船，或强行突入敵機塲，或衝入敵陣斬殺敵兵，凡此種種壯烈無比之攻擊隊，皇軍將兵實爲任何國家軍隊所不能爲者，誠不勝感激之至。綜觀現階段之戰局，太平祥方面戰勢進未可樂觀，然敵長途之補給路，全綫悉遭我軍攻擊，余相信我方在此即有可把握勝利之良機。加之皇軍自去夏以來，在中國大陸發動作戰，獲滅華中華南渝軍重要據點，使駐渝美空軍毫無發動之餘地，更進而打通華南越南間之陸路連絡。另一方面北緬之皇軍，以渝軍企圖奪回緬甸，現仍在繼續勇戰猛鬥中。担任鎭守北方之皇軍將兵，亦使敵英美決無侵入之餘地。綜上以觀，可知我防衛東亞之戰略態勢，極爲堅固，故今日我一億同胞急應奮起，繼特攻隊勇士之後，</p>
<p>決戰施策亟謀實現</p>
<p>於生產方面發揮必勝戰鬥精神，政府亦舉全力，從速實行必勝施策，官民一體排除困難　進增强戰力，才不負前綫將兵之勇戰，完成後方之任務，相信我一億同胞今日此時一致努力所獲之成果，最近將來非僅可將菲律賓周圍之敵軍擊退，更可與拉巴爾。玻根維爾等地皇軍將兵相呼應，而結成能鞏固轉換戰局基礎之決戰之力。政府爲打開此重大戰局所欲採取之決戰施策，其根本方面在急速動員現有國力，置於一重點上，積極增强戰力，以確立完遂戰爭之必勝體制，强力果斷實行各種施策。余認決戰下施行國政之根本態度，對戰局之一進一退不必喜憂，唯有力求實現可驀進制勝大道之强力政治。政府爲使行澈底決戰化，首由中央地方對行政之粽合推進，講求更適切之措置，同時使地方行政協議會長與地方陸海軍當局緊密連絡，俾期一體圓滑推進。關於防衛與增强戰力之軍政施策，最近敵機之空襲帝都及本土各要地，尤其日前敵機竟敢冒襲伊勢神宮，使一億同胞莫不痛恨，然空襲之被害極爲輕微，國民士氣反而愈形昻揚，於戰時生產方面仍作驚人之活躍，此實堪欣慰。</p>
<p>積極生產增强戰力</p>
<p>料今後敵機必仍繼續來襲，茲爲急速加强工塲訪護設施，以期空襲下生產之增强，不致發生障磇與遲滯，積極購求必要措置，同時急謀澈底疏散大都市之人口，並整備防空救　設施。故今後無論敵機來襲如何熾烈，軍官民一體必須期此防空態勢之完整，深信我等一億同胞堅持保護皇國之鬥魄，無論何時何地，見有敵之侵襲，均有負起防衛國土重任之決意，並於日常生活如生產防空方面，發揮明朗奮鬥之精神。至軍需生產之增强，須知我前綫將兵一致熱望後方者，乃爲大量增產優秀之航空兵器，如此，時攻隊方能拚死擊滅敵艦船。又政府除航空兵器外，且增强鋼鐵輕金屬液體燃料等之生產，於確立戰力之基礎後，並支援增强大陸方面之生產。關於加强科學技術力之動員，可期創造各種決戰兵器，並使其性能向上者，亦決不惜作最大之努力。又爲全面加强生產與防衛，決在周密計劃下，急速將軍需工塲予以疏散或移設地下，同時爲使勞務資材等澈底化爲戰力，今後更擬促進企業之整備</p>
<p>勤勞動員改善刷新</p>
<p>又確保食糧，乃安定國民生活增强戰力之基礎，自不待言。此後鑒於食糧需要之增大與運輸力之現狀，決克服一切困難，按各地之實情，實行米麥及甘　等等非常增產，努力積極增强國內自給。上述確保增强國家戰力，其根本要在國民之動勞力總動員，全國民使勤勞能率發揮至最高度，始能達成此等目的。關於勤勞動員與管理，政府擬加强一貫調整，施以有效之刷新改善，以收獲國民皆工之成果。至於海上運輸力之增强，政府排除萬難，努力促進建造新船，同時至少亦謀確保現有船隻，以期有效之軍用。</p>
<p>官民一體維護皇國</p>
<p>維此次戰爭之本質，乃所謂「非存即亡」而具有極英煒之性質者，是故皇國國體能否維護無窮，悉繫於今日官民努力之成果能否支持。此次戰爭，敵方濫事議論戰後國際機構問題期排除帝國一切之妥協，呼號無條件投降，企圖抹殺帝國，凡此只足一笑。維謹皇國國土之道，惟在官民一致，排除一切阻碍，同心協力，完逐聖戰目的。總之，政府當基於上述方針，强力實施諸般決戰措施，確立必勝情勢，把握勝利，並且强力推行中央及地方行政，以期從速實現。敵人英美民族藉和平美名，而其制覇世界之野心，隨戰爭之進展漸已暴露，而於彼等佔領地域關於　益分配問題，已展開深刻之相尅與對立。</p>
<p>道義理念保衛東亞</p>
<p>反之，我大東亞各國則在東亞復興之共同理想下，結集總力，堅持信念，保衛東亞而奮起，毅然遇進完遂戰爭擊滅英美。同時大東亞宣言結晶之共存共榮道義瑾念，決非英美之侵略戰爭之目的所能比擬，帝國政府對東亞各民族比種奮鬥精神，衷心表示敬意，同時並始終基於大東亞共同宣誓闡示之各國共同信念與決意，爲解放東亞完遂共同戰爭邁進以求實現。歐洲方面盟邦德國，於希特勒元首領導下，出其全力對敵反擊，爲期敵人早日低頭而努力，吾人謹祈德國國民今後繼續奮鬥。爲保衛鄉土而蹶起之東亞各國之有力反攻，已使敵人不得不分其戰力於東西兩戰塲，而其補給致受深重之威脅。誇構物量豐富之美國，今亦因人力資源之逼迫，已呈窘態，軍需生產大感不足，現已警吿國民，戰局前途未容樂觀，若不實現劃期之增產，則於短期內不能結束戰爭，乃重新制定國民徵用法。</p>
<p>忍受艱苦完成勝利</p>
<p>今戰局業已到達彼我之耐苦戰之決定階段，且今後愈將加重，然深信無論遭任何危局，亦繼續其必勝之奮鬥精神，戰至最後者必能獲得最後勝利。際此時期，一億同胞尤應與前綫將士之奮戰相呼應，堅持維護團體之信念，忍受千辛萬苦，努力增强戰力，防衛國土，早日完遂聖戰目的以安聖慮。</p>
<h3>希望爲上海市民　解決困難問題　歡迎茶會中馮炳南演詞</h3>
<p>今天上海特別市政諮詢委員會，上海特別市商會，上海市民福利協會，上海慈善團，中國新聞協會上海區分會等五團體舉行茶會，歡迎周市長羅秘書長，大家在此同聚一堂，實在是很難得的機會。</p>
<p>趨難避易</p>
<p>我最近患病兩個月，這次胃病復發比至今尙未痊愈，所以今天不能出席歡迎會，覺得非常抱歉。我雖然不能親來出席，可是很想趁這機會，向周市長羅秘書長道賀，同時把所要說的幾句話，託李贊侯先生代爲轉達。周先生在「吿上海市民書」中說上海的局面是複雜而困難的。爲了上海的局面複難而困難，我更要向周先生道賀。因爲在這種複雜而困難的局面之中，周先生有一個絕好的機會，可以替上海的市民解決種種複雜而困難的問題。我國有「趨易避難」這麽一句話，我想把這句話反過來改爲「趨難避易」。我主張「趨難避易」，因爲困難的事人人不肯去做，或者沒有能力去做，而容易的事人人都會做，人人都爭先恐後去做。周先生的才幹是十分優異的，我相信周先生在主持上海市政時，一定可以趨難避易，做平常人所不肯做或者所不能做的事情。</p>
<p>身心健全</p>
<p>現在周先生擔任上海市長的聯責，這個時會是很難得的。我在向周先生道賀之餘，只想貢獻一個簡單的意見，希望周先生能够採納。我覺得爲政者對於國家，對於人民，其根本的責任，就是使國家强盛，使人民身心健全。人民身心健全，就是國家强盛的基礎。人民只有身的健全而沒有心的健全，那是不够的，只有心的健全，而沒有身的健全，那也是不够的。我認爲爲政者在承平時代應該負起這種責任，在戰爭時期更應該負起這種責任。如果人民身心不健全，國家不但沒有强盛的希望，而且連存在也沒有希望。要達到身的健全的目標，必須使人民獲得最低限度的營養，要達到心的健全的目標，必須注意一般敎育事業。如果人民身心能够健全，則陳代主席歷來提倡的廉潔政治，就可以實現。但廉潔並不是單純的，官吏固然要廉潔，同時人民亦不可不廉潔。孔子也曾說過物格而后知至，知至而后意誠，意誠而后心正，心正而后身修，身修而后家齊，家齊而后國治，國治而后天下平的話。這幾句從前初學的蒙童，已都熟讀，是大家所知道的。然而心正身修不獨關乎個人，關乎國家，並且關乎天下，實在是極重要的一件事。關於這兩個問題，可以講的話很多，現在因爲時間翻係，只想用抽象的方決簡單說幾句話。</p>
<p>三定主義</p>
<p>我認爲在這戰爭的時期中，要實施這些最基本的條件，必須實行「三定主義」。甚麽呌做「三定主義」呢：所謂「三定主義」就是（一）安定民生，（二）穩定金融，（三）平定物價。第一，安定民生一定要從配給米柴油鹽等等日用必需品入手，配給的數　必須足敷市民健康上所需要的最低量，使每個市民都能獲得量低限度的營養。同時，近來各級學校的學費這麼高漲，原因乃是生活費用的增高。如果民生可以安定，生活費用不再增高，那麽學費也就不會這麽高漲，失學的現象可以消滅，敎育的問題因此也可以解決。不獨敎育如此，其他一般問題也莫不如此。所以安定民生是一種極重要的工作。第二，穩定金融不能以通貨膨脹或通貨緊縮爲對策。由一方面看來，戰時通貨膨脹是不可避免的，由另一方面看起來，通貨緊縮在戰時也是辦不通的。所以我覺得應該在通貨膨脹與通貨緊縮這兩個極端之間，謀一個適當的，合理的對策。這樣金融一定可以達到穩定的地步。第三，講到平定物價，我常常聽見增加生產爲平定物價的要件的話。當然增加生產是平定物價的要件，可是要使生產增加，第一步必須先謀「再生產」。所謂「再生產」就是指消費量可以不斷補充之意。「再生產」已經可以平定物價，增加生產，不獨可以平定物價，而且可以壓低物價。我很相信「三定主義」，周市長如果肯採納我的主張，一定能够實行「三定主義」：因爲周市長的幹部誠如他自己所說，是「壯年有爲」的。局先生有一個「壯年有爲」的幹部，這一點不但我很羨慕他，我相信全上海的市民也都羨慕他。以他逍麽一個「壯年有爲」的幹部，抱着「想做好」的泱心來上海辦理市政，「不敷衍，不因循，不茍安，不辭勞瘁，不打官腔，切切實實的埋頭苦幹」，尤其是羅秘書長，雖然還沒有和他會見過，可是時常聽說他的抱負是不凡的，辦事頗有果敢的，這在行政者施政時是不可須臾缺乏的要件。我相信一定可以爲上海的市民謀福利，這眞是値得吾人欣幸的事。</p>
<p>末了，祝周市長羅秘書長使命成功，並祝周市長羅秘書長及市政府各局處長曁各團體諸位先生健康。</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>上海當前的緊要工作</h3>
<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>本市五團體歡迎周市長羅秘書長，席間發表演說，移載於次：</p>
<p>周市長羅秘書長就職以後，民間輿論一致表示好感，方才主席已經講過。各報也已充分分表示期待與讚譽，這幷不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>禮記上說：「苛政猛于虎」，是指煩苛的政令，兇猛超過了殺人的惡虎，是形容苛政的害民之深。我所說當今的苛政，是物價高漲，却幷不是政令。而上海物價高漲，是因爲官商競賽的結果。所謂官商就是指貪官與奸商。我們幷不否認物價高漲有其經濟上的原因，例如生產减少，物資缺乏，遝驗阻滯，配給不合理等等。可是，人爲的原因，却更佔着極大部份。試舉數例以證：</p>
<p>（一）三十二年七月，上海米價每石爲一千七百八十二元，至三十三年十二月則爲三萬八千四百六十五元，一年半中高漲二十一倍以上。這是奸商的競賽。</p>
<p>（二）三十二年七月，配給米價每升爲四元五角，麵粉每斤二元二角，糖每斤四元七角，油每斤二十元四角，至三十三年十二月米則爲六十五元，漲十四倍又四。麵粉三十一元，漲十六倍。糖五百六十元，漲一百十九倍。油二百八十元，漲十三倍又七。這是官方的競賽。</p>
<p>黑市與官價的競賽提高，可以看出一方面奸商抬價，同時官方即遷就事實，准予提高，甚至官方授意奸商請求提高，無非是競賽牟利。於是人民受高物價壓迫，生活困苦，日甚一日。</p>
<p>現在周羅兩氏就任以後，一部分人大有「談虎色變」之槪。這裏的虎，是鎭壓邪惡的虎。而談之色變的，並不是老百姓，而是貪官與奸商。爲什麽要色變呢？就是怕受制裁。最近報上透露工務局職員舞弊消息後，當局立刻將嫌疑人犯扣留偵訊。不過，類似的弊病很多，茲舉一例：我前天碰到「位上海會兒院的負責人，他們以前每月有米五包配給，後來物品配給處成立，應得的五包米就不發，經商懇結果，允發三包，而每包另收手續費三千元。貧兒院負責人爲取得貧兒食糧，納了賄當然還不敢講。傳說配給處有作弊的集團組織，加入其間的一個科員，每月可分到五十萬元。我們也知道前馮處長本人很規矩，不過用人失察是無可諱言的。一般的說，各機關的作弊情形極晋遍，我們不主張過分追究過去舊帳，可是，一定要知道過去弊病所在，然後加以改革。所以，目前廢除苛政，就以抑平物價爲第一，革除積弊爲第二，不先革除積弊，就不能抑平物價，這是目前上海最緊要做到的第一件事</p>
<p>其次，要談到確保治安。過去在上海馬路上是「關卡林立」，沿途勒索。所以，治安確保是大成問題的。自從局羅兩氏接事以後，沿途勒索之事，因震於威名，大爲歛跡。但是，我們認爲如果不能積極的提高維護治安的軍警的待過，消極的繼續不斷的嚴厲禁止，那來，「關卡」勒索的現象，必將復活，而重苦市民。同時，確立市區治安仍屬不够，並應確立上海市區外闖各縣的治安，對於縣長人選及保安隊軍警等加以澈底革新，最近我們接到南匯讀者來信報吿，「南匯塞費方面，民衆除應繳納政府規定稅收外，還向土匪納田賦田畝稅營業稅等，較政府所規定的正稅超過數偕。而最堪痛恨者，市府所屬的一部分公務人員，却爲匪類奔走協收捐款。其次，上海的投機商，很多到鄉下從事操縱市塲，大都操縱米及食用品，藉以逃避上海人的耳目。因此，若輩爲團坐享暴利，更興當地匪類勾結。治安發生障碍。」這可證明上海外圍各縣治安的重要。治安確立，同時可以取締投機商人活動。所以，確保治安爲目前上海第二件急需做到的事。</p>
<p>第三要加强保甲組織，以及疏散人口。上海保甲制度確立，過去已有相當功績，希望更進一步加强組織與完成一元化。此外，爲了減少物資消耗，有利於抑平物價，爲了減少敵人空襲時的無辜犧性，爲了有助於確保治安，目前疏散人口確有必要。希望政府領導，聯合民間福利團體，同鄉會，水陸交通機關，組織强有力的疏散委員會，切實做到逐漸疏散不必要留居上海的人口。我們不主張强迫疏散，因爲自願疏散者正多。最要的應給予自願返鄉者最大的便利。請到這裏，第一難關就是車站輪埠的障礙重重，非用量大的力量克服不可。譬如車站的黑帽子留難需索，竊取行李，已爲衆口交費，應立即嚴厲取締。車票的不易購到，黑市票集團　斷等等，都是亟待解決的問題。</p>
<p>總之，挽救上海的危機，必須官民一致協力。衝破難關，政府當局以大無畏的決心，革除過去積弊，奠定新政基礎。市民們尤其是社會各界領袖，智識份子，千萬不能袖手旁觀，均須負起一份子責任，有力出力，有錢出錢，在政府統籌領導之下，貢獻全力，眞正做到官民一致。我們有了新生面目，有了新生力量，自然能够得到盟邦的重覜，自然能够得到盟邦的協助。我們期以三個月內小有成績，六個月內大有成績。敬以此熱望，貢獻於周市長羅秘書長以及各局處長，幷以市民諸君共同勉勵，羣起奮鬥。</p>
<h3>重光外相演說　闡明外交方針</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日本第八十六届議會席上，重光外務大巨演說要旨如次：</p>
<p>邇來帝國與同盟各國之連繫愈趨堅固，吾等須始終一貫，與同盟國並肩作戰。於今日，盟邦德國突破萬難，繼續敢鬥，是極堪驚嘆者，德國國民在希特勒元首率領下一致團精，不使兇敵侵汚國土一步，此種鐵血奮鬥之壯舉，實乃盟邦中之一偉觀也。至於墨索里尼領導下之義大利，現在孜孜調鍊國軍，且以名譽及光輝，與德國共同作戰中，德國之善鬥，業使英美恐怖之心胆曝露於白日之下。歡洲之戰爭，起自英國之干涉波蘭問題，此乃任人皆知者，時至今日。當初爲利用之小國全　出此口實之大國所漠視，波瀾已爲被棄孤兒，在開戰伊始，高呼「大西洋　章」，且被稱爲英美生命綫之政策，現已被棄如塵芥而不顧。彼等自稱爲「愛好自由之國」，然其戰爭目的，却非擁護小國，更不尊重自由，其眞正目的，乃在建設以英美爲中心「大國獨裁」之世界組織也者。彼等在此戰爭之白執期間，業已決定下次之戰爭，而日夜從裏準備，彼等對於某戰爭目的，已露出重大之矛曆傾向。大東亞戰爭，實英美爲剷除障阻彼等如此金圖之日本勢力而起者也，彼等欲奪東亞人之鄉土爲自已永久之殖民地，且以之爲支配世界之基地。吾人　賭生死之此次戰爭，實爲保衛東亞之戰爭，解放亞細亞之戰爭，解放亞細亞復興東亞，至此更爲明顯。今日之亞細亞業已覺醒，而東亞亦已全被解放，在英美之積年侵略及榨取中被解放之東亞，茲爲擊滅敵之再即侵入，而展國防衛國土之聖戰。然而此戰假若敗北，則東亞各民族絕不免永被侵略與榨取矣，新大東亞各國之存在，東亞全體之復興，當然惟有化爲泡夢而已。東亞各民族所以相結相携，意欲貫澈此項保衛鄕土之聖戰者，簀源於此，所以能滋生無限威力以完遂聖戰者，亦　源於此。（未完）</p>
<h3>華南日軍　完全佔領惠州　現正掃蕩殘敵中</h3>
<p>華南前綫日軍某基地二十一日中央社電　日華南駐軍有力部隊於十四日黄昏，向廣九鐵路方面開始行動，沿惠樟公路東進，擊潰渝軍第二十旅主力，於十六日上午七時將惠江沿岸渝方要衝惠州攻陷，目下正於該地區掃蕩殲敗之渝軍。初時渝軍似已察知日軍進攻，當即將惠樟公路破壞切斷，然日軍精說仍不顧一切困難，繼續急進，十五日傍晚侵入惠州南方敵主力陣地，加以包圍。是時排除渝軍之抵抗，自東西南各城門突入，完全將其佔領，現正在掃蕩中。今市內掃蕩工作完了後，日軍即出動確保附近一帶治安，目下市內秩序漸吿恢復，人民已次第歸來。</p>
<h3>緬甸前綫　日軍戰果</h3>
<p>東京廿一日中央社電　緬甸怒江地區，重慶遠征軍七師進攻畹町正面，其一部於畹町西方滬過龍川江，日軍當時施以猛攻，將之擊退。又南康方面曾有渝軍二師來攻，日軍確保畹町南康，已將渝軍擊退，一月上旬渝軍棄屍一千五百四十一具，破壞戰車一火砲五門。伊洛瓦底江東岸地區，重慶軍第五十師及英軍第卅六師，向孟米多一帶進攻，亦被擊退。伊洛瓦底江西岸地區綏播及莫尼瓦戰綫，日軍曾迎擊英印軍六師機械化一師共計七師。南部印緬國境方面，日軍自日溪撤退後，英印軍第廿六師曾進抵該地，現敵乃圖繼續增强兵力，又十二日於日溪東方五十公里地點，亦有一部敵軍登陸，該方面日軍正與敵激戰中。加拉丹河上流之西，敵第八十一師仍逐次沿該河南下中。日航空部隊曾於綏播附近，轟炸敵戰車及車輛部隊，收獲戰果極大。自九日以來曾連續轟炸企圖自海上增援日溪之敵艦船及登陸地點。</p>
<h3>上西里亞邊境　德展開反攻</h3>
<p>東普費士激戰中</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　海通社訊，德軍發言人稱：東綫戰事愈演愈烈，蘇軍堅强部隊向上西里西亞（德西甫部省區）邊境推進，現已遭遇德軍堅强之抵抗，蘇軍突入凱姆本區（Kempen），德軍在該處已取反攻措施。東綫第二戰事重心，在東普魯土南部，蘇軍在該處已進抵吉爾根堡·尼頓堡·巧齊爾三地，德軍雖已增强抵抗力，但蘇軍此種大規模行動，殊使德軍之反攻難以立即見效。蘇軍此次進攻，顯已傾注大部份之兵力。</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統　就職演說</h3>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　海通社引華盛頓消息：羅斯福總統昨發表就職演說，預示美國將不再回復孤立主義。其言略謂，吾人在此戰爭之一九四五年內，已以可怖之犧牲受到敎訓，但吾人將獲得其益。吾人之福利，須賴其他各國之福利而定，美國現正在經歷極大之試練，吾人須以全力迎取其成功。</p>

<p>李思浩詞　首由主席團代表李思浩致詞謂：「周市長·羅秘書長·各位局長處長·各位來賓：今天我們五團體歡迎各位新任市政長官，承蒙光臨，很爲榮幸。在半個月以前，我們也在這個地方歡迎陳代主席，因爲陳代主席負責中樞，辭去上海市長職務以後，因事來滬，我們仍未表示感謝意思，舉行歡迎會。今天歡迎周市長各位，意思雖同，而情緒各異。因爲周市長以次各位，都是我們的地方官，地方官一舉一動，都與市民有直接的密切關係。所以，今天歡迎會的情緒就格外熱烈。周市長對於治理上海的方局處長的輔助，目前上海的環境雖然複雜困難，可是，我們相信經過諸位的努力去做，一定能够打開僵局，克服難關。就周市長等接事以後的短短一周中，市民輿論已有一致推譽的好現象以觀，更可堅定這個信心。至於市長希望市民的協力，我們當然盡力喚起共同的責任感，做到眞正的官民一片。敬　周市長羅秘書長以及各位健康與努力。」</p>
<p>周市長詞　繼由周市長致訓詞，略謂：「這次來滬的決心與抱負，已在吿市民　中間單說明過，今天不再多講。總之，我們巳經抱具決心想把上海的事做好。做的結果，不管是事倍功半，甚至十徒勞無功，但是我們必須盡人事，然後可吿無罪，也決不會自己不努力，而　之於時局環境。剛才李贊侯先生說，我們來滬後，一般輿論不壞，對比，自己不但不覺得高興，反覺焦急，因爲輿論期待的，將來能否實現，並無把握。不過對於爲人民解除痛苦，有相當自信。過去不好的地方，想法做好，但是不是十天八天所做到的，希望三個月之後，也許可以有一個交代。在三個月之內，還盤市民稍予忍耐。警察保安隊的提高待遇，巳經決定辦法。這次我提出一個口號：「公利重於私利」，「社會先於個人」，以此　勉同僚，同時，希望市民隨時督促，凡是我的部下有違反這個原則的，一定嚴格糾正。本人耳目　有不周，盼望市民諸君隨時向本人報吿。更希望諸位將今天歡迎的意思加以擴充，盡力協助。」</p>
<p>羅秘書張致詞　復由羅秘書長致訓詞，略謂：「這次本人到上海市政擔任工作，站在幕僚的地位，歡迎的盛意是不敢當的。中國有兩句古話：「聲聞過情，君子恥之當本着良心，努力去做。本人這次來滬，不想活好名，只想切切實實痛痛快快的最哦一點實際工作，遵從市長意旨，尊重市民公意，對於害公利私的人，　對加以制裁。祗問有無制裁的必要，而不聞他背後有什麽力量。其次，附帶聲明的，本人還兼任財政局長，對於今後財政整理，巳經定有辦法，希望市民尤其社會各界領袖，一方面可以提出要求，一方面以實力協助。隨手方面固然不許額外浮收，可是，社會上有面子的人，也須不擺架子，不講情面，自動的卒先納稅。整理以後，希望由四十萬收入增至一百萬萬。我敢擔保，市府決不有所浪費。」</p>
<p>羅氏致詞畢，由陳彬龢，馮炳南兩氏演說，（演詞另錄）旋即進用茶點，至六時餘散會。</p>
<h3>歡迎會花絮</h3>
<p>— 澄</p>
<p>這次五團體歡迎周市長羅秘書長等茶會，最顯出特徵的，是「客滿」。爲近幾年來罕有的盛會。</p>
<p>第二個特徵，是「準時」，三百餘位來賓，都在五時左右十分鐘內到達，也是罕有的新精神。</p>
<p>本報陳社長演說詞中說，本市市民對周市長等一致推譽，「不是偶然德爾事」。上面所說的兩個特徵，也不是偶然的。</p>
<p>李　老爲主人方面代表，手持歡迎詞宣讀，御了眼鏡，咬字淸楚，態度嚴肅。</p>
<p>周市長羅秘書長，坐在正中，作爲均爲高逾額頂的長靠背椅。</p>
<p>幾個彪形大漢立在會塲一角，隨侍保護長官。大家向國旗行鞠躬禮時，其中一個面對眾賓屹然不動。</p>
<p>周市長似乎很高興的摸樣，演詞中很少客套浮詞，表示爲政不在多言的態度，且有自信的決心，足爲民解除不必要痛苦的保證。</p>
<p>羅秘書長態度很沉着，而說話很有力有膽，足爲周市長的壯年有未的幹部代表。旁邊坐着靑年軍人典型熊劍東參謀長。</p>
<p>新任各局處長，許江，徐季敦，劉德煊均出席，物配處長劉星辰未到，聞去浙江辦理財廳移交。</p>
<p>市政諮詢委員馮炳南因病未到，演說詞由市府秘書凌大　代爲宣讀。</p>
<p>平日常穿西裝的幾位，很多改穿長袍，如林康侯，陳中孚，楊惺華，陳日平諸位，大槪因爲天冷關係吧？</p>
<p>茶點中的咖啡，由CPC咖啡公司主任張寶存君贈送，表示歡迎。張君很熱心社會公益。對於本報助學金出力頗多。華懋公寓以花紮成「歡迎」兩字置貴賓面前，設計精美。</p>
<p>開會前忙了簽名處，散會後忙了衣帽間。電梯上下臨時廢止十分鐘一班制。</p>
<p>茶會後，市民福利會順便舉行理事會，交換疏散人口問題意見。</p>
<h3>各校徵收學費　訂定補充辦法　規定改善敎職員待遇</h3>
<p>年來本市各私立學校，以物價關係，均多以增加學費爲　注，但對於敎職員生活困苦，並未見減輕，而對於學生家長之負擔，則大都加重，且征收學費，若漫無限制，影響所及，至爲重大。市敎育局爲安定敎職員生活，及救濟失學學生起見，經於去冬動員內職員多人，分往較有歷史之私立中小學　實地調查學費及支配情形，即將調查統計之結果，並參照當時生活指數，擬定三十三年度第二學期私立中小學敎職員待遇暨征收學生費用暫行標準，呈請市府資敎育部核定施行，經見本市各報。後以生活指數突然激增，戴局長爲適應事實上之需要起見，爰急籌備就辦法，並認爲增加敎職員生活上至實物配給，實爲最有效之辦法，即與有關方面積極商洽，經蒙陳前市長之深切關懷，對敎職員食米特種配給，立即由一斗三升五合增至三斗，原期可稍補救，詎意目下情形，又非一月以前可比，故在安定敎職員生活及救濟失學學生之　本原則下，根據原定標準第十七條擬訂，補充辦法八項，茲照錄如次：</p>
<p>學費標準　兩次繳納　　設法增加敎職員物資配給種類。　對於曾經立案登記辦理優良之私利中小學校，予以經濟上之補助，此項補助費，以補助敎職員爲主。　第二學期各校征收學費，暫准按照原定最高標準提高一倍，即高中不得超過一萬二千元，小學高級不得超過八千元，小學中級不得超過七千二百元，低級暨幼稚園不得超過六千四百元，各校仍應斟酌上一學期收費情形，及大多數學生家庭經濟狀况而決定之，並應分兩次以上征收，藉便學生家長分期繳費</p>
<p>經濟公開　提高敎薪水　　各校免費學額，中等學校原定不得少於百分之十五，小學幼稚園不得少於百分之二十，如照第三項征收學費之學校，應各增加免費額百分之五，即中等學校不得少於百分之二十，小學幼稚園不得少於百分之二十五，藉以儘量容納淸寒學生。　各校校董會應對學校經費收支嚴予監督，校董尙未臻健全者，應由校長轉知專任敎員組織經費稽核委員會，審核收支賬目，絕對實行經濟公開。　各校付給敎職員薪俸，應照原定標準第四條以學費總收入，除房租外，不得少於百分之七十規定，增爲不得少於百分之七十五。　各校如有不遵上項辦法辦理者，視其情節輕重，予以適當之制裁。　除本補充辦法所規定者外，其餘仍應遵照呈准頒佈之修正上海特別市私立中小學敎職員待遇暨征收學生費用暫行標準辦理。上項辦法，業於日昨簽奉周市長核准，切實施行。</p>

<h3>Resumption of the 86th Session: Japanese Prime Minister Expresses Resolve to Implement Decisive Measures and Strive for Final Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The 86th session of the Japanese Diet reconvened on the 21st. The House of Peers opened its plenary session at 10:00 AM. Mr. Hokawa, on behalf of the House of Peers, reported on his visit to the Ise Grand Shrine on the 15th due to the enemy air raid on the shrine's grounds, respectfully praying for the Emperor's well-being. He also reported on his visit to the Grand Palace to inquire about the Empress Dowager's health. After these reports, Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech, followed by Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, who clarified the diplomatic policy. Subsequently, the agenda included a proposed amendment to the Pension Law (submitted by the government) and another bill. Director-General Miura of the Legislation Bureau explained the reasons for the proposals, which were then referred to a special committee. The session adjourned at 11:20 AM.</p>
<p>Full Text of Prime Minister Koiso's Speech</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The main points of Prime Minister Koiso's policy speech at the 86th session of the Diet are as follows: The war situation is developing more actively, and the Empire is encountering the most critical situation since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, reaching a point of either thriving or collapsing. Last autumn, the Imperial Army and Navy intercepted the enemy's attempted invasion in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines, achieving an unprecedented victory. However, despite suffering this heavy blow, the enemy, supported by abundant resources, landed on Itaitai Island and invaded Mindoro Island. Currently, the enemy has landed on Luzon Island with several divisions, making the situation increasingly critical.</p>
<p>Demonstrating Special Attack Spirit and Seizing Opportunities for Victory</p>
<p>Since the enemy's invasion of the Philippines, the Imperial Army's soldiers have been filled with fervent spirit to defend the national polity. All personnel have transformed into special attack units, bravely ramming enemy ships, forcefully breaking into enemy airfields, or charging into enemy lines to kill enemy soldiers. These incredibly brave attack units are something that soldiers of any other nation cannot achieve. I am deeply grateful. Looking at the current stage of the war, the situation in the Pacific is not optimistic. However, the enemy's long supply lines are being attacked by our forces across the board. I believe we have a good opportunity to seize victory here. Furthermore, since last summer, the Imperial Army has launched operations on the Chinese mainland, destroying important strongholds of the Chongqing army in central and southern China, leaving the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing with no room to operate, and further opening up land routes between southern China and Vietnam. On the other hand, the Imperial Army in northern Burma is continuing to fight bravely against the Chongqing army's attempts to retake Burma. The Imperial Army soldiers guarding the north are ensuring that the British and Americans have no room to invade. In summary, it can be seen that our strategic posture for defending East Asia is extremely solid. Therefore, today, our 100 million compatriots must rise up and follow the brave special attack unit warriors.</p>
<p>Urgently Seeking to Realize Decisive War Measures</p>
<p>We must demonstrate a spirit of certain victory in production. The government will also exert its full strength to implement decisive war measures as soon as possible. Government and people must work together to overcome difficulties and enhance war capabilities so as not to fail the brave soldiers on the front lines and to complete the tasks of the rear. I believe that the results of the united efforts of our 100 million compatriots today will not only repel the enemy forces around the Philippines in the near future but also echo the Imperial Army soldiers in Rabaul, Bougainville, and other places, forming a decisive force to consolidate and transform the foundation of the war. The government's decisive war measures to address this critical war situation are fundamentally focused on rapidly mobilizing existing national power, placing it on key priorities, actively enhancing war capabilities, and establishing a certain-victory system to complete the war, strongly and decisively implementing various measures. I believe that the fundamental attitude of governing the nation under decisive war circumstances should be to avoid being happy or sad about the advances and retreats of the war situation, but to strive to realize strong politics that can boldly advance to the path of certain victory. To thoroughly implement decisive war measures, the government will first promote the comprehensive advancement of administration at the central and local levels, seeking more appropriate measures. At the same time, we will ensure that the heads of local administrative councils maintain close contact with local army and navy authorities to promote integrated and smooth progress. Regarding military and political measures for defense and enhanced war capabilities, the recent enemy air raids on the capital and various key areas of the mainland, especially the audacious attack on Ise Grand Shrine, have caused outrage among our 100 million compatriots. However, the damage from the air raids has been minimal, and the morale of the people has become even more invigorated, continuing to engage in astonishing activities in wartime production. This is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>Actively Increasing Production and Enhancing War Capabilities</p>
<p>We expect that enemy aircraft will continue to attack. Therefore, in order to rapidly strengthen the protection facilities of factories, with the aim of enhancing production under air raids without causing obstacles or delays, we are actively seeking necessary measures. At the same time, we are urgently seeking to thoroughly evacuate the population of large cities and to improve air defense and rescue facilities. Therefore, no matter how fierce the enemy air raids may be, the military, government, and people must unite to ensure the completeness of this air defense posture. We firmly believe that our 100 million compatriots will uphold the spirit of protecting the Empire, and whenever and wherever there is an enemy invasion, we will all resolve to shoulder the important responsibility of defending the national territory and demonstrate a spirit of brightness and struggle in daily life, such as production and air defense. Regarding the enhancement of military supplies production, it should be known that our frontline soldiers unanimously hope that those in the rear will mass-produce excellent aircraft weaponry. In this way, the special attack units can risk their lives to destroy enemy ships. In addition to aircraft weaponry, the government will also increase the production of steel, light metals, liquid fuels, etc. After establishing the foundation of war capabilities, we will also support and enhance production on the mainland. Regarding strengthening the mobilization of scientific and technological capabilities, we will spare no effort to create various decisive war weapons and improve their performance. Furthermore, in order to comprehensively strengthen production and defense, we will rapidly disperse or relocate military factories underground under careful planning. At the same time, in order to thoroughly transform labor and materials into war capabilities, we plan to promote the consolidation of enterprises in the future.</p>
<p>Diligent Labor Mobilization and Improving and Refreshing</p>
<p>Moreover, securing food is the foundation for stabilizing the national livelihood and enhancing war capabilities, which goes without saying. Hereafter, in light of the increasing demand for food and the current state of transportation capacity, we are determined to overcome all difficulties and implement extraordinary increased production of rice, wheat, sweet potatoes, etc., according to local conditions, and strive to actively increase domestic self-sufficiency. The fundamental key to securing and enhancing national war capabilities mentioned above lies in the total mobilization of the national labor force. Only by maximizing the diligence and efficiency of the entire population can these goals be achieved. Regarding labor mobilization and management, the government plans to strengthen consistent adjustments and implement effective improvements and refreshments to reap the rewards of a nation of workers. As for enhancing maritime transportation capacity, the government will overcome all difficulties and strive to promote the construction of new ships. At the very least, we will seek to ensure the maintenance of existing vessels to ensure effective military use.</p>
<p>Government and People Unite to Protect the Empire</p>
<p>The essence of this war is what is called "either survival or destruction," which has an extremely magnificent nature. Therefore, whether the national polity of the Empire can be maintained infinitely depends entirely on whether the efforts of the government and people today can support the outcome. In this war, the enemy engages in reckless discussions about post-war international institutions, seeking to eliminate all compromises with the Empire, and calls for unconditional surrender, attempting to obliterate the Empire. All of this is laughable. The only way to uphold the path of the Empire is for the government and people to unite, eliminate all obstacles, work together, and complete the purpose of the holy war. In summary, the government, based on the aforementioned policies, will vigorously implement various decisive war measures, establish a certain-victory situation, seize victory, and strongly promote central and local administration in order to realize this as soon as possible. The enemy British and American nations use the name of peace, but their ambition to dominate the world has gradually been exposed as the war progresses. Regarding the distribution of profits in their occupied territories, deep conflicts and opposition have already unfolded.</p>
<p>Moral Ideals to Protect East Asia</p>
<p>Conversely, the countries of our Greater East Asia are united under the common ideal of East Asian revival, uphold their beliefs, rise up to protect East Asia, and resolutely advance to complete the war and defeat the British and Americans. At the same time, the co-existence and co-prosperity moral ideals crystallized in the Greater East Asia Declaration cannot be compared to the goals of the British and American war of aggression. The Imperial Government sincerely expresses its respect for the spirit of struggle of the various East Asian nations. At the same time, based on the common beliefs and resolutions of the various nations as elucidated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we will advance to liberate East Asia and complete the common war in pursuit of realization. On the European front, our ally Germany, under the leadership of Führer Hitler, is exerting its full strength to counterattack the enemy, striving to make the enemy bow its head as soon as possible. We sincerely pray that the German people will continue to struggle in the future. The powerful counterattacks of the various East Asian nations, rising up to defend their homelands, have forced the enemy to divide their war power between the East and West battlefields, and their supply lines are under severe threat. The United States, which boasts abundant material resources, is now in a difficult situation due to the pressure of human resources. The production of military supplies is greatly insufficient. It has already warned its citizens that the future of the war is not optimistic and that the war cannot be ended in the short term unless a epoch-making increase in production is achieved, and has newly formulated a national conscription law.</p>
<p>Enduring Hardship to Achieve Victory</p>
<p>The current war situation has reached a decisive stage of endurance battle between us and the enemy, and it will become more severe in the future. However, we firmly believe that no matter what dangers we encounter, those who continue their struggle for certain victory to the end will be able to achieve final victory. At this time, our 100 million compatriots should echo the fierce battles of the frontline soldiers, uphold the belief of maintaining unity, endure hardships, strive to enhance war capabilities, defend the national territory, and complete the purpose of the holy war as soon as possible to set the Emperor's mind at ease.</p>
<h3>Hope to Solve Difficult Problems for Shanghai Citizens: Feng Bingnan's Speech at a Welcome Tea Party</h3>
<p>Today, five groups, including the Shanghai Special Municipal Advisory Committee, the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Civic Welfare Association, the Shanghai Charity Group, and the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, held a tea party to welcome Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo. It is indeed a rare opportunity for everyone to gather here together.</p>
<p>Choosing the Difficult and Avoiding the Easy</p>
<p>I have been ill for two months recently. This recurrence of stomach illness has not yet fully healed, so I feel very sorry that I cannot attend the welcome party today. Although I cannot attend in person, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, and entrust Mr. Li Zanhou to convey a few words that I want to say. In his "Letter to the Citizens of Shanghai," Mr. Zhou said that the situation in Shanghai is complex and difficult. Because the situation in Shanghai is complex and difficult, I want to congratulate Mr. Zhou even more. Because in this complex and difficult situation, Mr. Zhou has an excellent opportunity to solve all kinds of complex and difficult problems for the citizens of Shanghai. We have a saying in our country, "choose the easy and avoid the difficult." I would like to reverse this sentence and change it to "choose the difficult and avoid the easy." I advocate "choosing the difficult and avoiding the easy" because difficult things no one is willing to do, or has the ability to do, while easy things everyone can do, and everyone rushes to do them. Mr. Zhou's talent is excellent, and I believe that when Mr. Zhou presides over Shanghai's municipal affairs, he will definitely be able to choose the difficult and avoid the easy, doing things that ordinary people are unwilling or unable to do.</p>
<p>Healthy Body and Mind</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Zhou is shouldering the responsibility of Mayor of Shanghai, this is a very rare opportunity. In addition to congratulating Mr. Zhou, I would like to offer a simple suggestion, hoping that Mr. Zhou can adopt it. I feel that the fundamental responsibility of a government official to the country and the people is to make the country strong and to make the people healthy in body and mind. The health of the people's body and mind is the foundation of the country's strength. It is not enough for the people to have a healthy body but not a healthy mind, and it is not enough to have a healthy mind but not a healthy body. I believe that government officials should take on this responsibility in times of peace, and even more so in times of war. If the people are not healthy in body and mind, the country not only has no hope of being strong, but even has no hope of existing. To achieve the goal of a healthy body, it is necessary to ensure that the people obtain the minimum amount of nutrition. To achieve the goal of a healthy mind, it is necessary to pay attention to general education. If the people can be healthy in body and mind, then the clean government that Chairman Chen has always advocated can be realized. However, integrity is not simple. Officials must be clean, and the people must also be clean. Confucius also said that only when things are investigated can knowledge be extended; only when knowledge is extended can intentions be sincere; only when intentions are sincere can the heart be rectified; only when the heart is rectified can the person be cultivated; only when the person is cultivated can the family be regulated; only when the family is regulated can the state be well governed; only when the state is well governed can the world be at peace. These sentences, which were familiar to beginners in the past, are known to everyone. However, a rectified heart and a cultivated person are not only related to the individual and the country, but also to the world. It is indeed a very important matter. There is much to say about these two issues, but now, due to time constraints, I just want to say a few simple words in an abstract way.</p>
<p>The Three Determinations Doctrine</p>
<p>I believe that in this time of war, to implement these most basic conditions, it is necessary to implement the "Three Determinations Doctrine." What is the "Three Determinations Doctrine"? The so-called "Three Determinations Doctrine" is (1) stabilizing the people's livelihood, (2) stabilizing finance, and (3) stabilizing prices. First, stabilizing the people's livelihood must start with the rationing of daily necessities such as rice, firewood, oil, and salt. The amount of rationing must be sufficient to meet the minimum amount needed for the health of the citizens, so that every citizen can obtain a certain minimum amount of nutrition. At the same time, the tuition fees of schools at all levels have been rising so sharply recently, the reason being the increase in living expenses. If the people's livelihood can be stabilized and living expenses no longer increase, then tuition fees will not rise so sharply, the phenomenon of dropping out of school can be eliminated, and the problem of education can be solved as a result. Not only education, but other general problems are also like this. Therefore, stabilizing the people's livelihood is a very important task. Second, stabilizing finance cannot use inflation or deflation as a countermeasure. On the one hand, wartime inflation is inevitable. On the other hand, deflation is also impractical in wartime. Therefore, I feel that we should seek a suitable and reasonable countermeasure between the two extremes of inflation and deflation. In this way, finance can definitely reach a stable state. Third, speaking of stabilizing prices, I often hear the saying that increasing production is the key to stabilizing prices. Of course, increasing production is the key to stabilizing prices, but to increase production, the first step must be to seek "reproduction." The so-called "reproduction" refers to the meaning that consumption can be continuously replenished. "Reproduction" can already stabilize prices. Increasing production can not only stabilize prices, but also lower prices. I very much believe in the "Three Determinations Doctrine." If Mayor Zhou is willing to adopt my proposal, he will definitely be able to implement the "Three Determinations Doctrine" because Mayor Zhou's cadres, as he himself said, are "young and promising." Mayor Zhou has a "young and promising" cadre, and this is something not only I envy him for, but I believe all the citizens of Shanghai envy him for as well. With such a "young and promising" cadre, holding the heart of "wanting to do well" in Shanghai to handle municipal affairs, "without perfunctoriness, without inertia, without complacency, without fatigue, without bureaucratic airs, and earnestly burying himself in hard work," especially Secretary-General Luo, although I have not yet met him, I often hear that his ambitions are extraordinary and that he handles matters with decisiveness. This is an essential element that administrative officials must not lack. I believe that he will definitely be able to seek welfare for the citizens of Shanghai. This is truly something that deserves our joy.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo success in their mission, and I wish Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, the heads of the various bureaus and departments of the municipal government, and all the gentlemen of the various groups good health.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Urgent Tasks for Shanghai Now</h3>
<p>— Chen Bin</p>
<p>Speeches delivered at a welcome reception for Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo hosted by five Shanghai organizations, transcribed below:</p>
<p>Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, public opinion has unanimously expressed goodwill, as the chairman has already stated. Various newspapers have also fully expressed their expectations and praises, which is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>The Book of Rites says, "Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger," referring to vexatious policies that are more ferocious than a man-eating tiger, illustrating the profound harm of oppressive government on the people. What I call oppressive government today is high prices, though not necessarily a policy. The high prices in Shanghai are the result of competition between officials and merchants. By "officials and merchants," I mean corrupt officials and treacherous merchants. We do not deny that high prices have economic causes, such as reduced production, lack of supplies, transportation delays, and unreasonable distribution. However, human factors account for a significant portion. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>(1) In July of the thirty-second year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], the price of rice in Shanghai was 1,782 yuan per shi (a unit of dry measure), and by December of the thirty-third year [i.e., 1944], it had risen to 38,465 yuan, an increase of more than 21 times in a year and a half. This is the competition of treacherous merchants.</p>
<p>(2) In July of the thirty-second year, the price of rationed rice was 4.5 yuan per sheng (a unit of dry measure), flour was 2.2 yuan per jin (a unit of weight), sugar was 4.7 yuan per jin, and oil was 20.4 yuan per jin. By December of the thirty-third year, rice was 65 yuan, an increase of 14.4 times; flour was 31 yuan, an increase of 16 times; sugar was 560 yuan, an increase of 119 times; and oil was 280 yuan, an increase of 13.7 times. This is the competition of officials.</p>
<p>The increasing competition between the black market and official prices shows that on the one hand, treacherous merchants are raising prices, while on the other hand, officials are accommodating the facts and allowing increases, even instructing treacherous merchants to request increases, all for the sake of competing for profits. As a result, the people suffer under the oppression of high prices, and their lives become more and more difficult.</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Zhou and Mr. Luo have taken office, some people have the impression of "turning pale at the mention of a tiger." This tiger is the tiger that suppresses evil. And those who turn pale at the mention of it are not the common people, but corrupt officials and treacherous merchants. Why should they turn pale? Because they fear being punished. Recently, after news of corruption by officials of the Public Works Bureau was revealed in the newspapers, the authorities immediately detained and interrogated the suspects. However, similar malpractices are numerous. Here is one example: the day before yesterday, I met with the person in charge of "a Shanghai orphanage. They used to receive a ration of five bags of rice per month. Later, after the establishment of the Goods Allocation Office, the five bags of rice they were supposed to receive were no longer issued. After much pleading, they were allowed to receive three bags, but each bag was charged a handling fee of 3,000 yuan. The person in charge of the orphanage, in order to obtain food for the poor children, paid the bribe and, of course, dared not speak out. It is rumored that the Allocation Office has a corrupt organization, and a staff member who joined it can receive 500,000 yuan per month. We also know that the former director, Mr. Feng, was very upright himself, but his poor judgment in employing people cannot be denied. Generally speaking, corruption in various government departments is extremely widespread. We do not advocate excessive pursuit of past accounts, but we must know where past malpractices lay and then reform them. Therefore, the most urgent task now is to abolish oppressive government, with suppressing and stabilizing prices as the first priority, and eradicating long-standing malpractices as the second. Without first eradicating long-standing malpractices, prices cannot be suppressed and stabilized. This is the most important thing that Shanghai must do now.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must talk about ensuring public safety. In the past, the roads in Shanghai were "lined with checkpoints," extorting money along the way. Therefore, ensuring public safety is a major problem. Since Mr. Zhou and Mr. Luo took over, the extortion along the way has greatly subsided due to their reputation. However, we believe that if we cannot actively improve the treatment of the military and police who maintain public safety and continue to strictly prohibit it passively, then the phenomenon of "checkpoints" and extortion will inevitably revive, and the citizens will suffer again. At the same time, establishing public safety in the urban area is not enough; we should also establish public safety in the counties outside Shanghai's urban area, and thoroughly reform the county magistrate's selection and the security forces and police. Recently, we received a letter from a reader in Nanhui reporting that "in Nanhui, in terms of paying fees, in addition to paying the taxes stipulated by the government, the people also pay land tax, acreage tax, and business tax to bandits, which exceeds the government's regular tax by several times. And what is most hateful is that some civil servants belonging to the municipal government are running around for the bandits to help collect donations. Secondly, many speculators in Shanghai go to the countryside to manipulate the market, mostly manipulating rice and food supplies, in order to escape the eyes and ears of Shanghai people. Therefore, these people collude with local bandits to sit and enjoy huge profits, and public safety is hindered." This proves the importance of public safety in the counties surrounding Shanghai. Establishing public safety can also crack down on the activities of speculators. Therefore, ensuring public safety is the second most urgent thing that Shanghai needs to do now.</p>
<p>Third, we must strengthen the baojia (neighborhood self-governance) system and disperse the population. The establishment of the Shanghai baojia system has had considerable success in the past, and we hope to further strengthen the organization and complete unification. In addition, in order to reduce consumption of resources and help stabilize prices, in order to reduce innocent sacrifices during enemy air raids, and in order to help ensure public safety, it is necessary to disperse the population now. We hope that the government will lead, unite with civil welfare organizations, fellow-countrymen associations, and land and water transportation agencies, and organize a strong evacuation committee to effectively achieve the gradual dispersal of the population that does not need to stay in Shanghai. We do not advocate forced evacuation, because there are many who are willing to evacuate voluntarily. The most important thing is to provide the greatest convenience to those who voluntarily return to their hometowns. Here, the first difficulty is the many obstacles at the train stations and ports, which must be overcome with a large amount of effort. For example, the blackmail and extortion by the "black hats" (railway police) at the stations, and the theft of luggage, have been complained about by everyone and should be strictly prohibited immediately. The difficulty in obtaining tickets, the monopoly of black market ticket groups, and so on, are all problems that need to be solved urgently.</p>
<p>In short, to save Shanghai from the crisis, officials and the people must work together. To overcome the difficulties, the government authorities must have the courage to reform past malpractices and lay the foundation for a new administration. The citizens, especially the leaders of all sectors of society and intellectuals, must not stand idly by, but must take on their share of responsibility, contributing their efforts and money, and contributing their full strength under the unified leadership of the government, truly achieving unity between officials and the people. With a new face and new strength, we will naturally gain the trust of the Allied nations and naturally gain the assistance of the Allied nations. We expect to see small achievements within three months and major achievements within six months. We offer this fervent hope to Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and the heads of all bureaus and departments, and encourage all citizens to strive together.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's Speech Clarifies Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speech at the 86th session of the Japanese Diet included the following main points:</p>
<p>Recently, the ties between the Empire and its allied nations have become increasingly strong. We must consistently fight alongside our allies. Today, it is truly amazing that our ally, Germany, continues to fight bravely despite overcoming countless difficulties. The German people, under the leadership of Führer Hitler, are united in spirit and will not allow the fierce enemy to defile their territory by even one step. This heroic act of iron and blood struggle is truly a magnificent sight among the Allied nations. As for Italy, under the leadership of Mussolini, it is now diligently training its troops and fighting alongside Germany with honor and glory. Germany's skill in battle has exposed the terror of the Anglo-Americans to the light of day. The war in Europe originated from Britain's intervention in the Polish issue, which is known to everyone. Today, the small countries that were initially used have been neglected by the great powers that used this pretext. Poland has become an abandoned orphan. The "Atlantic Charter," which was proclaimed at the beginning of the war, and the policy that was called the lifeline of the Anglo-Americans, have now been abandoned like dust. They call themselves "countries that love freedom," but their war aims are not to protect small countries, nor to respect freedom. Their true aim is to build a world organization of "great power dictatorship" centered on the Anglo-Americans. During their reign of power in this war, they have already decided on the next war and are preparing for it day and night. They have revealed a serious tendency to engage in contradictions regarding certain war aims. The Greater East Asia War was started by the Anglo-Americans to eliminate the Japanese power that hinders their ambitions. They want to seize the homeland of the East Asians as their permanent colony and use it as a base to dominate the world. We are staking our lives on this war to protect East Asia and liberate Asia. Liberating Asia and revitalizing East Asia has become even clearer. Today, Asia has awakened, and East Asia has been fully liberated. East Asia, liberated from years of Anglo-American invasion and exploitation, is now waging a sacred war to defend its homeland and destroy the enemy's re-invasion. However, if this war is lost, the East Asian nations will inevitably be invaded and exploited forever. The existence of the new Greater East Asian nations and the revitalization of East Asia as a whole will naturally become nothing but a bubble dream. The reason why the East Asian nations are uniting and cooperating with each other is to carry out this sacred war to defend their homeland. The reason why they can generate infinite power to complete the sacred war also originates from this. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in South China Completely Occupies Huizhou, Now Mopping Up Remaining Enemy Forces</h3>
<p>From a certain Japanese army base on the South China Front, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – A powerful unit of the Japanese army stationed in South China began operations towards the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway on the evening of the 14th, advancing eastward along the Huizhou-Zhangmutou Highway, defeating the main force of the Chongqing army's 20th Brigade, and capturing Huizhou, a key point on the Huijiang River controlled by the Chongqing army, at 7:00 a.m. on the 16th. Currently, they are mopping up the defeated Chongqing army in the area. Initially, the Chongqing army seemed to have detected the Japanese army's attack and immediately destroyed and cut off the Huizhou-Zhangmutou Highway. However, the elite Japanese army ignored all difficulties and continued to advance rapidly. On the evening of the 15th, they invaded the main position of the enemy south of Huizhou and surrounded it. At that time, they eliminated the resistance of the Chongqing army and broke into the city through the east, west, and south gates, completely occupying it. Currently, they are mopping up the area. After the mopping-up operation in the city is completed, the Japanese army will be dispatched to ensure the security of the surrounding area. Currently, order in the city is gradually being restored, and the people are gradually returning.</p>
<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army on the Burma Front</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – In the Nujiang River area of Burma, the 7th Division of the Chongqing Expeditionary Force attacked the front of Wanting. A part of it crossed the Longchuan River west of Wanting. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack at that time and repelled them. In the Nankan area, two divisions of the Chongqing army came to attack. The Japanese army secured Wanting and Nankan and had already repelled the Chongqing army. In early January, the Chongqing army abandoned 1,541 bodies and destroyed one tank and five artillery pieces. In the area east of the Irrawaddy River, the 50th Division of the Chongqing army and the 36th Division of the British army attacked the Mengmi area and were also repelled. In the area west of the Irrawaddy River, on the Shwebo and Monywa lines, the Japanese army countered a total of seven divisions of the British Indian 6th Division and the mechanized 1st Division. On the southern Indo-Burmese border, after the Japanese army withdrew from Hikai, the British Indian 26th Division advanced to that area. Currently, the enemy is trying to continue to increase its forces. On the 12th, a part of the enemy army also landed at a point 50 kilometers east of Hikai. The Japanese army on that side is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. West of the upper reaches of the Kaladan River, the enemy's 81st Division is still gradually descending along the river. The Japanese air force bombed enemy tanks and vehicle units near Shwebo, achieving great results. Since the 9th, it has continuously bombed enemy warships and landing sites attempting to reinforce Hikai from the sea.</p>
<h3>German Counteroffensive Launched on the Upper Silesian Border</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting in East Prussia</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Huitong News Agency reports that a German military spokesperson said: The war on the Eastern Front is intensifying. Strong Soviet forces are advancing towards the border of Upper Silesia (part of the province in western Germany) and have encountered strong German resistance. Soviet forces have broken into the Kempen district. The German army has taken counteroffensive measures there. The second focus of the war on the Eastern Front is in southern East Prussia. Soviet forces there have advanced to Gilgenburg, Neidenburg, and Ortelsburg. Although the German army has increased its resistance, the large scale of the Soviet operation makes it difficult for the German counteroffensive to be effective immediately. The Soviet offensive has clearly poured in most of its forces.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt's Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Huitong News Agency cites Washington as saying: President Roosevelt delivered his inaugural address yesterday, foreshadowing that the United States will no longer return to isolationism. His remarks were roughly as follows: We have learned a lesson in this war in 1945 with terrible sacrifices, but we will reap its benefits. Our welfare depends on the welfare of other countries. The United States is now undergoing a great trial, and we must use all our strength to achieve its success.</p>
<h3>Provisional Government of Hungary Declared Established</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) – Huitong News Agency reports: The organization of the Provisional Government of Hungary was announced by Moscow on December 24, 1944. Its prime minister is General Miklós. The government is currently located in Debrecen.</p>

<h3>Five Organizations Welcomed the New Municipal Officials Yesterday, Mayor Zhou Expressed His Determination</h3>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Committee, the Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens Welfare Association, the Charity Organizations, and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association jointly hosted a grand tea party yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m. at the Hua Mao Apartments to welcome Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and the newly appointed bureau and department heads. Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo arrived on time, and the new Director of the Economic Bureau, Xu Jiang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Xu Jidun, Director of the Publicity Department, Liu Dexuan, and other bureau and department heads of the municipal government also attended.</p>
<p>Guests Attending:童侶靑, 李守黑, 李天眞, 丁福保, 虞仲咸, 潘景賢, 吳湖帆, 沈爾昌, 施蛰存, 尤懷皋, 章士钊, 李祖躉, 宋卓哉, 王叔賢, 徐鐵珊, 金雄白, 范回春, 王伯元, 虞志學, 聶潞生, 黃敬齋, 許冠羣, 潘三省, 黃雨齋, 傅隆才, 周邦俊, 沈長賡, 趙鉦鏜, 孫鳴歧, 張慰如, 趙晋鄕, 顏福慶, 朱順林, 許建平, 張寶存, 鮑國昌, 王懷康, 陳亞夫, 李權時, 吳國璋, 王海波, 奚潤耕, 潘炳臣, 李規席, 張競立, 趙正平, 胡春榖, 王式園, 陶晶孫, 羅洪義, 王學晨, 金家鳳, 凌憲文, 邵式軍, 許敬甫, 陳中孚, 魯風, 顧南羣, 蓋滌生, 姚慶三, 錢大鈞, 吳开斋, 潘達, 項康原, 楊惺華, 丁伯雄, 沈嗣良, 陳正章, 鄭洪年, 孫仲立, 黃宣平, 裴雲卿, 帥伯春, 許曉初, 張文魁, 張善珉, 李澤, 吳君異 (in order of arrival), and more than 300 other people. They were warmly received by the representatives of the five organizations, Li Sihao, Wen Qishi, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Chen Binhe, creating a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Li Sihao's Speech: First, Li Sihao, the representative of the presidium, gave a speech, saying: "Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, directors, department heads, and guests: Today, our five organizations welcome all the newly appointed municipal officials. We are honored by your presence. Half a month ago, we also welcomed Acting Chairman Chen at this place, because Acting Chairman Chen was responsible for the central government and resigned from his position as Mayor of Shanghai. After coming to Shanghai on business, we still expressed our gratitude by holding a welcome reception. Today, welcoming Mayor Zhou and everyone else has the same meaning, but the emotions are different. Because Mayor Zhou and everyone else are our local officials, and every move of the local officials has a direct and close relationship with the citizens. Therefore, the emotion of today's welcome reception is particularly warm. Mayor Zhou's assistants in governing Shanghai and the current environment in Shanghai are complex and difficult. However, we believe that with your efforts, we will definitely be able to break the deadlock and overcome the difficulties. Judging from the unanimous praise from public opinion after Mayor Zhou and others took over for a short week, we can further strengthen this confidence. As for the Mayor's hope for the cooperation of the citizens, we will of course do our best to awaken the common sense of responsibility and achieve true unity between officials and the people. We wish Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and everyone good health and hard work."</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou's Speech: Mayor Zhou then gave a speech, saying: "The determination and ambition to come to Shanghai this time have already been explained in the announcement to the citizens, so I will not say more today. In short, we have made up our minds to do a good job in Shanghai. Regardless of whether the result is more effort than effect, or even complete futility, we must do our best, and then we can be acquitted. We will never blame the situation and environment for our own lack of effort. Mr. Li Zanhou just said that general public opinion has not been bad since we came to Shanghai. On the contrary, I not only do not feel happy, but feel anxious, because there is no guarantee that the expectations of public opinion can be realized in the future. However, I have considerable confidence in relieving the people of their suffering. We will try to do better in the past bad areas, but this cannot be done in ten days or eight days. We hope that citizens can be patient for a little longer. The method of raising the salaries of the police and security forces has already been decided. This time, I put forward a slogan: 'Public interest is more important than private interest,' and 'Society comes before the individual.' I encourage my colleagues with this, and at the same time, I hope that citizens will supervise us at any time. If any of my subordinates violates this principle, I will strictly correct them. I hope that if my eyes and ears are not attentive enough, the citizens will report to me at any time. I also hope that you will expand the meaning of today's welcome and do your best to help."</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo's Speech: Secretary-General Luo then gave a speech, saying: "This time, I came to work in Shanghai's municipal government, standing in the position of a staff member. I am not worthy of the grand welcome. There are two old sayings in China: 'A reputation exceeding reality is a disgrace to a gentleman. We should act with conscience and work hard. This time I came to Shanghai, I don't want to live a good name, I just want to do some practical work in a down-to-earth and happy way, follow the Mayor's intentions, respect the public opinion of the citizens, and punish those who harm public interest and benefit themselves. I only ask whether there is a need for punishment, and I don't hear what power he has behind him. Secondly, I would like to state that I also serve as the Director of the Finance Bureau. I have already set a method for the financial reorganization in the future. I hope that the citizens, especially the leaders of all sectors of society, can make demands on the one hand and assist with strength on the other. Of course, no extra fees are allowed, but people with face in the society must not put on airs, not talk about personal relationships, and automatically pay taxes first. After the reorganization, I hope to increase the income from 400,000 to 1 million. I dare to guarantee that the municipal government will never waste it."</p>
<p>After Mr. Luo's speech, Mr. Chen Binhe and Mr. Feng Bingnan delivered speeches (the speeches are recorded separately). Then, tea and refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned at six o'clock.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Welcome Reception</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature of this tea party held by the five organizations to welcome Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and others was that it was "full of guests." It was a rare grand event in recent years.</p>
<p>The second characteristic was "punctuality." More than 300 guests arrived within ten minutes around five o'clock, which was also a rare new spirit.</p>
<p>President Chen of this newspaper said in his speech that the unanimous praise of Mayor Zhou and others by the citizens of this city "is not an accidental matter." The two characteristics mentioned above are also not accidental.</p>
<p>Mr. Li acted as the representative of the host, holding the welcome speech and reading it clearly and seriously without his glasses.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo sat in the center, with high-backed chairs that were higher than their heads.</p>
<p>Several burly men stood in a corner of the venue, protecting the officials. When everyone bowed to the national flag, one of them stood still, facing the guests.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou seemed very happy. His speech had few polite and superficial words, expressing the attitude that governing is not about talking too much, and had a confident determination to guarantee to relieve the people of unnecessary suffering.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo's attitude was very calm, and his speech was very powerful and courageous, making him a representative of Mayor Zhou's young and promising cadres. Next to him sat Xiong Jiantong, a typical young military officer and chief of staff.</p>
<p>The newly appointed bureau and department heads, Xu Jiang, Xu Jidun, and Liu Dexuan, all attended. Liu Xingchen, the director of the Materials Allocation Office, was absent, and it was heard that he went to Zhejiang to handle the transfer of the Finance Department.</p>
<p>Feng Bingnan, a member of the Municipal Advisory Committee, was unable to attend due to illness. His speech was read by Ling Daqi, the secretary of the municipal government.</p>
<p>Many of those who usually wear suits changed to long robes, such as Lin Kanghou, Chen Zhongfu, Yang Xinghua, and Chen Riping, probably because of the cold weather?</p>

<h3>Collection of Tuition Fees by Various Schools; Supplementary Measures Defined; Stipulations to Improve Teacher Compensation</h3>
<p>In recent years, various private schools in the city have mostly resorted to increasing tuition fees due to rising prices. However, there has been no reduction in the hardship experienced by teachers and staff, while the burden on students' parents has largely increased. Moreover, the unlimited collection of tuition fees has significant implications. To stabilize the livelihoods of teachers and staff and to aid students who might drop out due to financial difficulties, the Municipal Bureau of Education mobilized several staff members last winter to conduct on-site investigations into the tuition fees and their allocation in private primary and secondary schools with longer histories. Based on the results of the investigation and statistics, and with reference to the prevailing cost of living index, a tentative standard for teacher compensation and student fee collection in private primary and secondary schools for the second semester of the 33rd year of the Republic was drafted. This draft was submitted to the Municipal Government for review by the Ministry of Education and was subsequently reported in the local newspapers. Later, due to a sudden and sharp increase in the cost of living index, Director Dai urgently prepared supplementary measures to address the factual needs. He believed that providing teachers and staff with in-kind rations was the most effective solution. He actively consulted with relevant parties, and with the deep concern of former Mayor Chen, the special rice ration for teachers and staff was immediately increased from 1.35 dou to 3 dou, hoping to provide some relief. However, the current situation is incomparable to that of even a month ago. Therefore, based on the fundamental principle of stabilizing the livelihoods of teachers and staff and aiding students who might drop out due to financial difficulties, eight supplementary measures were drafted based on Article 17 of the original standard. These measures are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Tuition Standards; Two Installments; Efforts to Increase the Variety of Material Rations for Teachers and Staff; Economic Subsidies for Well-Managed Private Primary and Secondary Schools That Have Been Registered and Approved, with the subsidy mainly for teacher compensation. Tuition fees collected by schools in the second semester are temporarily permitted to be increased by up to double the original maximum standard, i.e., no more than 12,000 yuan for high schools, no more than 8,000 yuan for senior primary schools, no more than 7,200 yuan for intermediate primary schools, and no more than 6,400 yuan for junior primary schools and kindergartens. Schools should still consider the fee collection situation from the previous semester and the economic conditions of most student families when making decisions. Furthermore, fees should be collected in two or more installments to facilitate payment for students' parents.</p>
<p>Financial Transparency; Increase Teacher Salaries; The number of free student places in each school should be no less than 15% for secondary schools and no less than 20% for primary schools and kindergartens. Schools that collect tuition fees according to Item 3 should each increase the number of free places by 5%, i.e., no less than 20% for secondary schools and no less than 25% for primary schools and kindergartens, to accommodate as many needy students as possible. The school board of directors should strictly supervise the school's financial income and expenditure. If the board of directors is not yet soundly established, the principal should inform the full-time teachers to organize a financial audit committee to review the income and expenditure accounts and absolutely implement financial transparency. The salaries paid to teachers and staff should be increased from no less than 70% to no less than 75% of the total tuition revenue, excluding rent, as stipulated in Article 4 of the original standard. Schools that fail to comply with the above measures will be subject to appropriate sanctions depending on the severity of the circumstances. Except as stipulated in these supplementary measures, the remaining provisions shall still be implemented in accordance with the revised "Provisional Standards for Teacher Compensation and Student Fee Collection in Private Primary and Secondary Schools in the Shanghai Special Municipality" that have been submitted for approval and promulgated. The above measures were approved by Mayor Zhou and will be implemented effectively.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Reporters Host a Banquet for Director Liu</h3>
<p>The city's press corps, in view of the fact that the new Director of Publicity, Liu Dexuan, comes from a journalistic background, hosted a banquet at the Jinjiang Hotel yesterday (the 21st) at 6 p.m. to express their sincere welcome. Those attending included Du Shenyan of the Central News Agency, Cao Youzhi of the Xinwen Bao, Zhang Cheng of the Ping Bao, Yao Luochuan of the Xin Zhongguo Bao, Qian Jiaxue of the Zhonghua Ribao, Xue Xiaoxue of the Xin Shen Bao, Wang Fu of the Guomin Xinwen, and reporters from this newspaper, totaling more than ten people. Director Liu Dexuan attended the banquet on time, and the conversation was very pleasant.</p>
<h3>Seventh Period Household Coal Briquettes; Payment and Delivery</h3>
<p>After a long period of preparation, the authorities in charge of the seventh period household coal briquettes allocation have gradually completed their preparations and will begin general distribution within this month. However, the quantity allocated per person and the standard selling price per catty (市斤), as well as the start and end dates, will be officially announced later. The Coal Briquette Industry Association has been ordered to carry out various procedures and has set a deadline of today and tomorrow for companies designated to sell this period's household coal briquettes to pay the money to the Association at 587 Jing'an Temple Road to pick up the goods from the designated manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Extension of Deadline for Distribution of Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>The date for the distribution of coarse grains to residents in the former First District based on the Item Distribution Office's Comprehensive Distribution Certificate No. 36, which was previously announced by the office as running from January 10th to the 21st, is about to expire. It is heard that some residents have not yet received their allocation. The distribution of these coarse grains was delayed, and the relevant authorities only recently received the delivery vouchers. Furthermore, due to the transition between the old and new administrations, various retail outlets still had inventory from the Feng administration that could be used for sales. Therefore, the office issued a notice to all retail outlets on January 11th, ordering them to prioritize the distribution of existing inventory to meet the needs of residents. However, it has recently been discovered that some unscrupulous individuals are making excuses and delaying distribution, which is extremely deplorable. As for the previous reports in various newspapers stating that the deadline was the 17th, this was also a misrepresentation. The new Director Liu has issued a public notice informing everyone that the deadline has been extended to the end of the month.</p>
