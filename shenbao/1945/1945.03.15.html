<h3>琉黃島北部地區激戰　日軍施勇猛反擊　兩日間殺敵兵員千餘名</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　琉黄島之美軍，以日軍北部地區爲攻擊重點，連日展開激戰，敵軍艦砲，機槍，火燄發射器及戰車等等，攻擊極爲激烈，日軍蒙相當損害，但仍死守陣地，勇猛反擊。十一，十二兩日，在北部地區附近判明所獲戰果如次：殺傷敵軍千二百五十名，擱淺戰車四輛，鹵獲重機槍一，輕機槍十四，自動步槍六十五，彈藥多數。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　琉黄島美軍部隊，十二日曾於迫擊砲，機關槍，空中炸雷之攻擊掩護下，向北部日陣地終日加以强壓，其一部終於侵入該地區陣地東方面天山東方台地，然經日守備隊奮勇激戰，使其遭逢阻止後，該方面日軍之攻擊，稍爲愼重，但依然於日軍陣前二百米附近，力謀强化陣地，並企圖闢隧道開始進攻。十三日敵軍又於砲擊下。隨同戰車開始全面攻擊，日軍死守要點，對時行來攻之美軍，實行猛烈反擊，是役，爲美軍攻擊重點之天山方面及北方地區陣地南正面，戰况遂陷於深刻狀態。此外，於八日夜進出玉名山方面至大阪山方面之日軍有力部隊，仍在敵陣繼續奮戰中，美極恐日軍之反擊及夜間之肉搏突擊，乃於自方部隊前面二十米至五十米間，配置有無數各種發火器，無論有無目標，均加以盲射，更於步哨綫前時常發放照明彈，力謀發現日軍肉搏攻擊隊。</p>
<h3>東埔寨五獨立　宣布廢展與法締結之保護條約　遵照大東亞宣言旨趣對日協力</h3>
<p>百囊奔十四日中央社電　東埔寨王國政府十三日宣言獨立，並發表聲明如次：鑒於世界時局與大東亞之現勢，東埔寨王國認爲邇後不須法國保護，茲宣布與法國簽定之保護條約從此無效，並宣言東埔寨王國回復獨立。東埔寨王國基於過去之光榮歷史，謀其繁盛，遵大東亞宣言之旨趣，擔任共榮圈之一員，傾注兵力邁進，以達成目的。東埔寨王國完全信仰日本政府，常以所有資源協力日本帝國，期完成其目的。</p>
<p>金邊十三日中央社電　安南王帝於十一日廢棄法安保護條約，宣言獨立後，東埔寨王亦於十三日在金邊聲明廢棄東埔寨保護條約，宣言獨立，該宣言稱：（一）法國與東埔寨間締結之保護條約及其協定，自簽署聲明書之日起無效。（二）東埔寨王國自本日起爲一獨立國。（三）全國人民應認淸此重大事實，爲建設大東亞共榮圈，與日本全面協力，以謀東埔寨之繁宋。</p>
<p>趙南行政機構恢復</p>
<p>西貢十三日中央社電　印度支那自排除敵性政權後，日軍司令官布吿中經提及「對於當地政府不加任何改變，且尊重其旣存各法令，並繼續法國方面之政治組織」。故總督府爲最高中央行政機關，今亦依舊存在，「總督」一職，以德古被拘，已告虛縣，現由軍司令官擔任印度支那最高負責人。由松本大使任印度支那最高顧問，以司總務長官事務，其下設原有之各部局。又十一日宣言獨立之安南帝國，其最高顧問由横山全權公使擔任，東埔寨王國最高顧問爲久保總領事，此外，舊老撾保護領內之琅勃利那王國日本顧問尙未確定。獨立國之行政，在日人顧問之下，對以前之現住民行政，完全照舊繼續。舊直轄殖民地交趾支那之知事，爲荒田總領事，舊屬領東京之理事長官爲勝田總領事，安南帝國顧間爲丁村總領事，西貢堤岸河墅總領事及河內小長穀總領事，代理兩市長亦經決定。至於警察行政，由春日憲兵隊長兼任警視總監，除此重要地位外，餘仍由當地居民分別擔任職務。</p>
<h3>日泰兩國關係密切</h3>
<p>盤谷十四日中央社電　日駐盤谷大使館情報都長，十二日於日泰記者團共同會見席上，發表談話如次：泰國國民置次忠吿稱，日泰關係與日越關係大不相同，按日泰關係之結成，爲攻守同盟條約，在名義上旣不相同，兩者之本質，亦根本各異。蓋日泰同盟條約，係兩國以共通理想及信念爲基礎，爲同心之結合，故兩國間之親睦，縱戰局任何變轉，毫無影響。此事徴能過去三年日泰關係之事當，即可明瞭，例如關於日泰協力交涉，雙方縱遇如何困難，亦能順利推進。越南態度常以利已爲前提，缺少一貫精神，隨戰局演變，自反軸心軍在歐洲登陸以來，其傾向益形顯明’不僅暗中通敵，且不履行共同防衛之責，以致成爲保衛東亞之大患。余相信泰國國民對日本此次之處置，當可充分理解，日本政府基於大東亞共同宣言，對安南及其他各民族獨立盡力相助，泰國之獨立，由於邊境敵性國已吿崩潰，更趨堅固，同時日本促進泰越間之物資交流，現可逐步實現，對泰國國民經濟生活之緩和，當可收事半功倍之效。</p>
<h3>日內務省發表　更迭東拓總</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日本東拓總裁佐佐本駒之崇氏，以此次被勅選爲貴族院議員，特辭去總裁之職，頃者，內務省對後任總裁一職，決以副總裁池邊龍一氏昇任，並起用前大藏次官松限秀雄氏爲副總裁。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>破除成規</h3>
<p>在非常時期，一切行動措置，應有非常的部署與非常的手段，才能適應非當時期的需要。不但軍事上絕對需要，就是一般的政治經濟以至社會事業，也都有此需要。承平時期與非常時期所不同者就在於此。所謂非常的部署與非常的手段，其內容幷不依照平時的程序手續，或是平時的進行方法，而完全出以迅速果決，祗須達成目的，不辭抄走掩徑。簡單的說，非常時期的一切，爲達成非常目的，實有破除平時成規的必要。</p>
<p>試就政治機構與政治效率而言，在非當時期，必須實行簡素化，重床疊架的機構固須裁併，即行文程序也須簡單，減少彼此牽制延宕的積習。其次，即辦公時間也須打破規定不變。在規定的工作時間以內固然準時從公，即在規定工作時間以外，也須延長工作時間，今日事今日畢。同時，一件工作，在每一部門辦理時，都須負起責任迅速處理。平時的推諉延宕，牽制躭擱的習氣，非常時期應一掃而空。這樣，才能確立戰時體制，發揮非常時期的政治效用。</p>
<p>更就經濟效用而言，統制經濟已爲非當時期必須採用的政策。在統制進行過程中，必須嚴格迅捷，充分掌握統制物資。同時，統制目的並非囤積或壟斷物資，而在供應軍用與配給民需，所以，在配給過程中又須嚴格迅捷，軍用民需兩有裨益。統制與配給機構必須分工合作，相互配合。如果統制機構不能掌握統制物資，不能嚴格迅捷進行統制，則決不能完成統制使命。如果配給機構沒有物資配給，則徒具配給之名，統制自統制，配給不配給，決非非常時期統制經濟政策之目的。</p>
<p>就世界各國，在非常時期有非常措置而收效者而言，例如盟邦日本，在軍事方面頗多非常功績，而最能誇耀世界者，就是陸海軍的特別攻擊隊與神風攻擊隊，他們的隊員並非在軍事上熟請戰略或戰術的軍事專家，按官階說，幾乎全是中尉少尉，以至下士，按年齡說，最長不過三十歲，最少者不滿二十歲。而他們却構成了最受人民歌功頌德的英雄，這就是在非當時期中非常行動的具體表現。其次，如蘇聯在德蘇戰爭之初，受到德國軍隊的嚴重壓迫，史太林城失掉大半，列奪城陷於包圍，莫斯科亦將陷落之際，蘇軍竟能重振旗鼓，反佔優勢，其所以成功的最大理由，在於不斷的提拔新進人材和少壯幹部，同時大刀闊斧地罷免過去有功而現在能力不足適應當前需要的高級指導者。也就是在非常時期中提拔新人材的非常措置之功效。</p>
<p>在中國官塲有一句例言，叫做「蕭規曹隨」，這是後任接替前任以後照例的話，好的說法是謙抑，不好的說法是盲從。在此非常時期，只有不斷求進步，不能存保守觀念。頃者江蘇省任省長因公蒞滬，昨天對於江蘇省政近况發表談話，他却沒有說出官塲例言，他說：「說老實話，不唱高調。………各守本分工作，無誇張，無虛妄的幹去。」這可證明任氏已有打破成規的決意，我們對於今後江蘇省政不禁寄以一新面目的期待。</p>
<h3>空襲大阪敵機　墜毀卅餘架　大本營發表邀擊戰果</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日大本營十四日下午四時三十分發表：自十三日夜半至十四日未明，敵機來襲大阪地區時，經我方邀擊後，所獲之戰果如次：（一）擊墜十一架，（二）予以損害者的二十架。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　敵B29型機約九十架，自三月十三日下午十一時半起，亘約三小時，空襲大阪地區，自雲上作盲炸，因此市內幾處遭受損害，但至十四日上午九時半，大部火災已行消滅。</p>
<h3>財部陳次長談　本年施政槪况　將發行公債平衡預算</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　財政部次長陳之碩氏，昨日下午四時接見中外記者，報吿該部最近各項施政狀况如次：本部直轄機關計有關務·鹽務·稅務三署，各該署今年施政情形：</p>
<p>（一）「關務」　關於關務行政，將粵海關監督江海關監督先後裁撤，關務收入現况三十三年度華中華南分解國庫之關稅，計有國幣二十八萬萬以上，華北計聯銀三千一百多萬元。</p>
<p>（二）「監務」　事變後因交通關係運輸困難，致稅收銳減，現財部對運轍問題正在設法中。</p>
<p>（三）「稅務」　目前稅務收入，佔國家稅收第一位，其中最大者爲捲烟稅，關於捲烟稅自本年三月一日起，登記價格及稅率均已提高，三十三年度稅率爲百分之五十五，自本年三月一日起改爲百分之六十五，增加百分之十，然照目前情形，因原料缺乏及節電等關係，捲烟稅恐難達到預算數字。</p>
<p>（四）「關於本部事項」</p>
<p>賦稅　第一點爲各省市賦稅均能　照中央調整規定通行，苛捐雜稅尙有少數地方存在，本部刻正注意調整。此外尙有通行稅及香燭稅，通行稅在三十三年度採取委辦制，委託中日合辦之交通公司代辦，成績優劣不一，經部方力加調整，頗有進步，目前已達四千多萬元。香燭稅爲最近舉辦之稅，香燭稅征收由總局辦理之，惟滬市係委托本作等同業公會代辦，三省一市則由該市直接征收，每月的收一千三百萬元左右，此外尙有錫箔稅，現每月已可征收三百多萬元。此外關於地方政府實物征收一節，本部視地方實際情形，在可能範圍內准其施行，現已有若干地方開始實行，成績尙稱不惡，惟征收實物亦僅限米麥兩項。</p>
<p>錢幣司方面　錢幣司主管工作爲金融機關，現因各地銀行錢莊仍間有新設，因此外界頗多不明眞相，本部事先均經縝密考慮，視實際情形之需要而核准，在初辦時確較寬鬆，現則絕對嚴格。此外關於特別金融機關方面，如保險業亦力謀强化，最近已在中儲行下設檢查保險業事務所，實施初步檢查，至對保險法之修正，本部茲在起草中。尙有交易所監理委員會，現已歸由財部單獨管理，並改設交易所監理員辦公處，對於不健全之股票，絕對不准上市，交易稅每月增加近已有四百萬元左右。</p>
<p>會計方面　三十四年上半年度國家總預算，每月爲三十六萬萬元，但實際收支尙不能平衡，透支四萬萬元左右，財部爲平衡收支彌補透支，決定發行三十四年度內國公債一種。至預算對象，以保障治安爲量要，的佔總預算之六成以上，其决爲增加生產，再次爲改善待遇。</p>
<p>公債及國庫方面　公債方面本年度決定發行內國公債，該項公債最高限額爲二百萬萬元，半年爲一百萬萬元，此外並繼續發行第二期建設公債三萬萬元。至國庫方面截至最近止尙應付裕如。關於消費特稅，消費特稅原由財政部直接辦理，本年一月一日起將消費特稅征收工作，委託各省市地方政府辦理，並規定將稅收之半數解繳中央外，其餘半數即貼補地方行政經費，實施以來除京市已經繳到外，其他各省市尙無解繳，致成績如何尙無從得知，惟據京市而觀，則較前爲佳，至稅率仍爲原規定百分之四，上海方面因行政費支出浩大，中央准其另加附加費，作爲補助滬市行政經費之用。</p>
<h3>三寶顏日軍　勇猛創敵</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫十四日中央社電　爭向三寶顏及强烈砲擊之掩護下，刻於埠頭飛機場附近，集積强藥及其他物資，幷於市外飛機塲北端之綫，以有力之戰車隊爲先鋒，攻擊日軍陣地，日方得悉，乃以具有威力之砲擊，予敵戰車隊以損害，更使其物資倉庫燃燒，敵軍頓呈混亂狀態。又於夜間發動勇猛突擊，計自敵登陸至十一日以來，所殺傷敵軍約三百名。</p>
<h3>同庭山調配記　（二）</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>人口農田　東山分四鎭六鄕人十六保九千餘戶，人口爲三萬五千餘人。目下有農田約五千餘畝。多爲小自耕農，有田二三畝，擁田百畝以上者絕少，而此五千餘畝中，桑田幾佔三分之一，餘爲稻田，前此沿太湖東面之「高地」本種晚稻，旋因螟虫爲害，損失巨大，今十之七八改種早稻矣。</p>
<p>佃農如係新戶，須納押租每畝十元，舊戶可免。田租去歲稻田爲糙米一石，折價三千元，桑田每畝百元，如佃戶在約定期內交租者，地主爲體恤佃戶起見，再打九折。至本年份之收租價格，須在收租期之十月始知。再此間之佃戶，如逾期不交田租者，地主可收回其耕地，目前東山田價約値四五萬元一畝，鎭上鬧區之地產，每畝約七萬元。</p>
<p>西山之面積倍於東山，故農田亦較多，約兩萬二千畝。全山分兩鎭八鄕，爲東湖鎭，消夏鎭，梨棠，匯里，鎭夏，涵値，鹿村，七賢，前灣，八鄉，人口約三萬數千人。全山繁華所在爲東湖鎭，人口亦最多，約四千餘人。區域最廣，住房較大者爲梨棠鄕。至消夏鎭者爲吳王避著之地，除多名勝外，沿湖魚塘甚夥。全錢分東蔡，西蔡，秦家堡數堡，人口一萬餘人。西山地廣人稀，鄉民男子多操漁業，婦女多爲苦工，至每年插秧植稻工作，則皆爲男子。</p>
<p>東西兩山，田賦每畝徴穀念二斤，照例官定爲徴收實物，但按諸實際，各鄉鎭長僅向農民按市價折現收取，事後再以款買穀，解仕縣政府。除此數外，「東山田賦分徵所」尙須附徴手續費一成。據記者調查，上年度田賦自開徵以來，迄今爲止，祗收得預期總額十分之一，實因常地治安不能確立，有以致之。</p>
<p>又當地之地方自治機關，向有向民衆徴收戶口補助費之辦法，用以興辦地方公家事業。目下每戶約收三四百至兩千元爲止，貧苦者豁免。</p>
<p>柴米醫藥　洞庭山自表面看來，不啻亂世之桃源，但如略加研究，則其內在的危機至夥。茲略舉數事以證：</p>
<p>（一）洞庭山民食以米爲大宗，每日約耗米二百五十担，但當地農田有限，產米僅足供一月之需，故米之來源，皆仰諸續涇，河南（浙江屬），木凟，長興等處，尤以長興一地最爲重要。設一旦來源不繼，恐慌立生。記者抵達之日，米價本爲三萬二千元，因受蘇州米價（五萬左右）影響，東山偸運食米赴蘇者甚多，致當地米價暴漲，造成有市無米現象。三月七日，後山鄉民以食米無從購得，惶惶不可終日，適　听鄉中有外來米船一艘，船主赴前山探聽市價，不肯立時脫手，鄕民乃羣集船邊，迫令開倉上岸，否則以巨石擊沉來船，後米商終於屈服，但杯水車薪，於事無濟。設今後米船從此裏足不前，此後洞庭山之食糧實成問題。記者離山之日，米慌有増無減，米價亦漲至四萬六千元矣。（未完）</p>

<h3>本市銀錢業改變放款方針　對於根絕投機意義重大</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業各大銀行錢莊，最近對於放款業務之運營，已多變轉新方向。據悉動產。不動產。統制品。日用品。正當商品等抵押放款，已拒絕承放。其拒做原因，蓋以期限過長，資金反受呆滯影響，需要活動運用，殊非易事。故現均儘量接受辦理短期貼票及特殊往來拆借等放款業務，其期限甚短，利潤優厚，尤最合資金隨時活動之條件。即運用資金數額，亦係分散於多方面，收回放出，比較輕而易舉。至於借款客戶，如其數額較少，則其利息與手續費亦輕，如係鉅額，則利息手續費按比率格外加重，確使客戶不勝負担。聞此舉對于根絕投機囤積，抑平物價，具有重大之意義。</p>

<p>法籍員警一律免職市警察局對全部法籍員警一一九名，已於昨日命令一律予以免職。又該局爲調整人事，一部份冗員業經淘汰，同業爲嚴格審查人事，對前曾犯法科刑者決不任用，故已着第三處防犯科重行審查現職人員指紋，倘有前科之員警，無論其職位階級。一律均予免職，並規定嗣後錄用人負，必須審查指紋。</p>

<h3>任省長蒞滬談　江蘇省政設施概況　本市六團體今日茶會歡迎</h3>
<p>江蘇省省長任援道，接事以還，對蘇省省政建設，建樹頗多，任氏於日前因公蒞滬。本市市商會。市政諮詢委員會。市民福利協會。中國新聞協會上海區分會。慈善團·蘇州旅滬同鄕會等六團體，爲表示歡迎任氏起見，特於今（十五）日下午舉行歡迎茶會。茲誌任氏發表江蘇省政談話如决：</p>
<p>「本人於去年十一月十日奉國府特命，接任江蘇省長兼駐蘇綏靖主任之職，蒞任四月，久欲來滬與各方領袖曁舊日友好，一相晤衆。終以雜務叢脞，未能及早如願，迺蒙各界不棄，惠予招待，實深漸惶。</p>
<p>江蘇省昆鄰上海市，位於長江三角洲大江南之心臟部，山川沃秀，原有穀倉之譽。還都後一切復興建設，國府當局及一般同胞，對之寄予之期望亦最爲殷切。自民卅夏首先實施淸鄕以來，所有設施與改進，尤爲中外所注意。本人就任之時間尙短，愧無成績可言，茲誡就一般省政之有足奉吿者，摘要披陳如：</p>
<p>（一）治安與生產</p>
<p>情鄕以來，由於駐省國軍與地方團隊，得盟邦部隊之協力，淸剿匪類，甚有收效，故省境治安，堪稱良好。本人奉命兼主綏政，對於所屬軍警，即積極設法改善待遇。充實整備，强化訓練，提高素質，更特別注意於軍風紀之肅正。同時佈署各縣聯防，整頓民衆保甲自衛，造成軍民團結一致之精神與體制。根絕不良份子之活動，從治安之確立，而得以全力從事於生產之增加。關於增產，本省現轄江南廿三縣，去年產稻米約二五，一八三，八九二担，麥約五，〇八四，五六〇担，其他雜糧大豆等等，皆有大量收成。較之前年略有增加。米糧除提供米統會之採購外，本省民食，尙可無慮。</p>
<p>（二）財政與賦稅</p>
<p>一般咸謂蘇省爲富庶之區，財政優於別地，實則量入爲出，支付浩繁，亦無時不感困難。然可負責指出者：（一）田賦實施實物徴收，省庫盈收，確較前年增加500％以上。（二）本年上半期全省支出槪算將達八十萬萬元之鉅，概以不增加人民負擔爲條件，而求其平衡。（三）澈底杜絕稅收上之積習陋弊，對包稅者取消所謂正比副比之惡例。對偸稅漏稅，依法嚴查嚴辦。舉例言之，如消費特稅，自部交省辦之後，增收額竟較前年多至四倍。（四）代行省金庫之江蘇地方銀行，經常確保存款額至一萬萬元。對省外貿易之運營，對省內工商業之推進，無不積極爲之。且爲增產所需，對於農村貸款，允盡其最大之努力。經濟財政漸人正軌，是可吿慰於諸君者也。</p>
<p>（三）敎育與建設</p>
<p>本人素常注重敎育事業，嘗謂國家多難，與其多編軍隊，莫如多辦學校。爲民族之將來計，亂世之從政者，尤應苦心爲之。故於本年元旦，曾公佈强化敎育爲省政設施之重點，現在本省敎育，在數量上已恢復事變前之規模，但因人才與設備之困難，內容上猶待努力之處尙多。對從敎人員，早已實行與公務人員同等待遇，如籌劃生活必需品之配給，臨時生活補助，特種生活保險等等，均已實行。雖不能盡如理想，亦足差可自慰。至於建設方面，爲適應戰時之需要，如公路之興修，公共事業之改進管理，礦山漁牧農墾蠶絲之督導，皆在兼程推進辦理之中。</p>
<p>（四）人事與其他</p>
<p>本人份屬軍人，習於戎伍，今次奉命執役桑梓，承各界之督促，地方父老之期待，凡事之應爲者，無不勉力以赴。所謂本軍人之精神，願力行之，說老實話而不須唱高調也。現在大東亞戰爭，日近於決戰時期，當秉承國府之方針，以爲施政之依歸，在確立治安，增進生產，肅正思想三大目標之下，致力於地方軍事政治之强固發展。即所以爭取最後勝利之要圖。幸本人部下同袍同僚，或爲久幕，或爲學人，或爲少壯，皆能悉體團結沉着之旨，各守本位工作，無誇張，無虛妄的幹去，尙請諸君，多予批評，多予鞭策，時近清明，仲春氣朗，倘諸君有興蒞蘇一遊，常掃榻以候明敎。</p>
<h3>市輪渡公司重行調整標價　通告稅照票收百分之十</h3>
<p>上海特別市輪渡公司，現以各項開支增加，爰自即日起將輪渡票資重行調整，新訂價目如下：（甲）客票：（一）上海至高橋六百元，（二）上海至東溝五百元，（三）上第至慶寗寺四百元，（四）上海至東昌路其昌棧一百元。（乙）貨票：（一）上海至高橋及上海至東溝，上海至慶寗寺四百元，（二）上海至東昌路其昌棧五十元。此外另加通行稅，按照票價增收百分之十。</p>
<h3>保甲處明茶會</h3>
<p>本市警察局保甲處，將於十六日下午三時，再度召集各該區總聯保長，各區主任委員，曁該處各區辦事處副主任等，舉行茶會，屆時對各區保甲工作有所商談。</p>
<h3>墾植公司投機遭市府駁斥</h3>
<p>市民徐道修，以中國墾植股份有限公司名義，以擁護國策推進戰時生產爲詞，呈請本市財政局租用徐家匯路肇嘉浜基二十畝，備作墾植之用，經財局轉呈市府核示。市府查得該徐道修前曾以中國墾植公司名義向前糧食局領得本市荒地多處，攷其經營方法，無非將領得之地，轉佃與農民耕種，共分秋色，從中取利，致糾紛迭起。此次復向財政局申請租用近地，同時又用復興商塲名義，呈請市府謂係建築商塲，復興市面。市府以該民請領目的，純係投機謀利，而中國墾植股份有限公司，亦未向實業部呈准註册，故已嚴予駁斥。</p>
<h3>台州同鄉疏散</h3>
<p>台州旅滬同鄉會成立疏散委員會，凡合州同鄕自願回籍者，先向民國路東自來火街口該會登記，以便代雇船隻分期疏散。</p>

<h3>敵美損失愈大戰力愈減低　出淵部長對記者談話</h3>
<p>盟邦日本陸軍報道部於十四日下午三時在漢彌登大廈循例接見中國記者國，由出淵部長報道敵美在東西兩戰綫所受損失浩大情形，談話如次：</p>
<p>必勝信念愈益堅強　三月十日日本臨時議會中，小磯首相答辭與陸海軍大臣演說，均稱日本帝國軍官民早經團結一致，斷然擊滅英美，確立堅强態勢。敵美以損失太大，擬於短期決戰，然而日本全體軍官民必勝信念堅强，敵如來犯，必遭殲滅無疑。聞美國軍事領袖現在華盛頓開會商討對日作戰問題，其作戰目的究在何處，雖尙不可知，但今後其戰爭前途有極大困難，頗爲顯然。據尼米資發表，敵美在硫黄島所耗之戰費與在倍里硫島所耗費者相同，其浩大可見一斑。根據美國報紙消息，敵美在硫黄島登陸於兩小時內，其第一隊死傷百分之廿五的兵力，第二小隊亦死傷百分之廿二以上，現在硫黃　戰鬥依然激烈，敵美仍將作出血之大量犧牲。敵方近時宣傳將在日本本土或中國大陸登陸，無論其在何處登陸，犧性必大，此種徒作無謂犧牲毫無意義之盲動，將來敵方亦將感覺其錯誤。</p>
<p>敵美自認損失浩大　現在敵美在東西兩戰綫人的資源所受損失極大，據二月廿八日美國廣播稱：美國醫院內傷兵有六十餘萬之多，以看護婦缺乏，故在議會中通過徴用看護婦決議案。又十八歲男子經八個月短期訓練後送到前綫之議案，雖然有國民反對，以人力缺乏，仍不能不予通過。美國徴募局未經當局許可，開始徴募已經退職之從事緊急軍需產業之三十八歲男子。觀於以上美國廣播，其人力缺乏，已達極點。</p>
<p>又美國下議院議員卡拉，在英國經濟雜誌上發表一文，比較英美兩國的損失，據稱：美國現已犧牲七百萬人以上的兵力，及三千萬萬美元的戰費。世人迷於敵美宣傳，往往對美國戰力估價過大，其在歐洲戰綫及太平洋戰爭所受損失非常重大，其戰力愈益減低，近敵方謀略宣傳欲短期結束戰爭，其目的可想而知。敵美愈狼奔豕突的盲進，則遭遇我方之攻撃愈烈，其損失亦必愈大。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in the Northern Part of Iwo Jima: Japanese Forces Launch Vigorous Counterattacks, Eliminating Over a Thousand Enemy Soldiers in Two Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – American forces on Iwo Jima are focusing their attacks on the northern area held by Japanese troops, engaging in intense battles daily. The enemy employs intense naval artillery, machine-gun fire, flamethrowers, and tanks, causing considerable damage to the Japanese forces. However, the Japanese troops resolutely defend their positions and launch vigorous counterattacks. On the 11th and 12th, the following battle results were confirmed in the vicinity of the northern area: 1,250 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, four tanks disabled, one heavy machine gun captured, fourteen light machine guns captured, sixty-five automatic rifles captured, and a large quantity of ammunition captured.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – On the 12th, American forces on Iwo Jima, under the cover of mortar, machine-gun, and aerial bomb attacks, exerted strong pressure on the Japanese positions in the northern area throughout the day. Part of them finally invaded the eastern area of the Japanese position, the eastern plateau of Mt. Ten. However, after fierce fighting by the Japanese garrison, they were stopped. The Japanese forces in that area became slightly more cautious in their attacks but are still striving to strengthen their positions near the 200-meter mark in front of the Japanese positions and are attempting to start an offensive by digging tunnels. On the 13th, the enemy launched a full-scale attack with accompanying tanks under artillery fire. The Japanese forces resolutely defended key points and launched fierce counterattacks against the American forces that were attacking. In this battle, the situation on Mt. Ten, the focal point of the American attack, and the southern front of the northern area position, became deeply entrenched. In addition, a strong unit of Japanese troops, which advanced from the direction of Mt. Tamanayama to the direction of Mt. Osaka on the night of the 8th, continues to fight bravely in the enemy's lines. Extremely fearful of Japanese counterattacks and nighttime hand-to-hand combat, the Americans have deployed countless various incendiary devices 20 to 50 meters in front of their own units, firing blindly regardless of whether there are targets. They also frequently launch flares in front of their sentry lines, striving to discover Japanese hand-to-hand combat teams.</p>
<h3>Eastern Cambodia Declares Independence: Announces Abolition of the Protection Treaty with France, Cooperates with Japan in Accordance with the Spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration</h3>
<p>Phnom Penh, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Royal Government of Eastern Cambodia declared independence on the 13th and issued the following statement: In view of the world situation and the current state of Greater East Asia, the Kingdom of Eastern Cambodia believes that French protection is no longer necessary. It hereby announces that the protection treaty signed with France is invalid from this point on and declares that the Kingdom of Eastern Cambodia has regained its independence. Based on its glorious past history, the Kingdom of Eastern Cambodia seeks its prosperity, takes on the role of a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in accordance with the spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration, and devotes its military power to advance in order to achieve its goals. The Kingdom of Eastern Cambodia completely trusts the Japanese government and will always cooperate with the Empire of Japan with all its resources to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>Phnom Penh, 13th (Central News Agency) – Following the abandonment of the Franco-Annamese Protection Treaty by the Emperor of Annam on the 11th and the declaration of independence, the King of Eastern Cambodia also declared the abandonment of the Eastern Cambodian Protection Treaty on the 13th in Phnom Penh and declared independence. The declaration stated: (1) The protection treaty and its agreements concluded between France and Eastern Cambodia are invalid from the date of signing the declaration. (2) The Kingdom of Eastern Cambodia is an independent nation from this day forward. (3) All the people of the country should recognize this important fact, fully cooperate with Japan to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and strive for the prosperity of Eastern Cambodia.</p>
<p>Restoration of the Southern Zhao Administrative Structure</p>
<p>Saigon, 13th (Central News Agency) – After the elimination of hostile regimes in Indochina, the Japanese commander's public announcement mentioned that "no changes will be made to the local government, existing laws and regulations will be respected, and the French political organization will be continued." Therefore, the Governor-General's Office remains as the highest central administrative organ. The post of "Governor-General" is currently vacant as Decoux has been detained. The commander of the Japanese forces currently serves as the highest person in charge of Indochina. Ambassador Matsumoto will serve as the highest advisor to Indochina to manage the affairs of the Chief Secretary. Under him are the existing departments and bureaus. In addition, Ambassador Yokoyama serves as the highest advisor to the Empire of Annam, which declared independence on the 11th, and Consul General Kubo serves as the highest advisor to the Kingdom of Eastern Cambodia. Furthermore, the Japanese advisor to the Kingdom of Luang Prabang within the former protectorate of Laos has not yet been determined. Under the Japanese advisors, the administration of independent countries will continue in the same manner as before for the existing residents. Consul General Arata will serve as the governor of the former directly governed colony of Cochinchina, Consul General Katsuta will serve as the Director-General of the former protectorate of Tonkin, Consul General Dinh Thon will serve as the advisor to the Empire of Annam, and the Consul Generals of Saigon-Cholon and Hanoi, as well as the proxy mayors, have also been decided. As for police administration, the commander of the Kasuga Military Police will concurrently serve as the Superintendent-General of Police. Apart from this important position, the remaining positions will continue to be held by local residents.</p>
<h3>Close Relationship Between Japan and Thailand</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 14th (Central News Agency) – The head of the information department of the Japanese Embassy in Bangkok made the following remarks at a joint meeting of Japanese and Thai journalists on the 12th: I would like to advise the Thai people that the relationship between Japan and Thailand is very different from the relationship between Japan and Vietnam. The formation of the Japan-Thailand relationship is a treaty of offensive and defensive alliance, which is different in name and fundamentally different in essence. The Japan-Thailand alliance treaty is based on common ideals and beliefs and is a unity of mind. Therefore, the amity between the two countries will not be affected by any changes in the war situation. This can be clearly understood from the past three years of the Japan-Thailand relationship. For example, regarding Japan-Thailand cooperation negotiations, both sides can smoothly promote them no matter how difficult they may be. Vietnam's attitude is always based on its own interests and lacks a consistent spirit. With the evolution of the war situation, especially since the landing of the Axis forces in Europe, its tendencies have become increasingly obvious, not only secretly communicating with the enemy but also failing to fulfill its responsibility for joint defense, thereby becoming a major threat to the defense of East Asia. I believe that the Thai people can fully understand Japan's actions this time. Based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Japanese government has done its best to help Annam and other ethnic groups achieve independence. Thailand's independence is becoming more secure as the hostile countries on its borders collapse. At the same time, Japan is promoting the exchange of goods between Thailand and Vietnam, which can now be gradually realized. This will have a multiplier effect on alleviating the economic life of the Thai people.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Breaking Established Rules</h3>
<p>In extraordinary times, all actions and measures should have extraordinary deployments and extraordinary means in order to adapt to the needs of the extraordinary period. This is not only absolutely necessary in the military field but also in general politics, economy, and even social undertakings. This is where peacetime differs from extraordinary times. The content of so-called extraordinary deployments and extraordinary means does not follow peacetime procedures or peacetime methods of operation but is completely based on speed and decisiveness, resorting to shortcuts if necessary to achieve the goal. In simple terms, everything in extraordinary times needs to break peacetime rules in order to achieve extraordinary goals.</p>
<p>Taking political institutions and political efficiency as an example, in extraordinary times, simplification must be implemented. Redundant institutions must be cut back, and the processing of documents must also be simplified to reduce the habit of mutual restrictions and delays. Secondly, the prescribed office hours must also be broken. While being punctual during the prescribed working hours, working hours must also be extended outside of the prescribed working hours to finish today's work today. At the same time, each department must take responsibility for a task and handle it quickly. The peacetime habits of procrastination, evasion, restriction, and delay must be swept away in extraordinary times. Only in this way can a wartime system be established and the political effectiveness of extraordinary times be brought into play.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of economic efficiency, a controlled economy is a policy that must be adopted in extraordinary times. During the process of control, it must be strict and swift, fully grasping controlled materials. At the same time, the purpose of control is not to hoard or monopolize materials but to supply military use and allocate civilian needs. Therefore, the allocation process must also be strict and swift to benefit both military and civilian needs. The control and allocation institutions must divide their labor and cooperate with each other. If the control institution cannot grasp controlled materials and cannot strictly and swiftly implement control, it will never be able to fulfill its control mission. If the allocation institution has no materials to allocate, it is merely an allocation in name only. Control is control, and allocation is not allocation, which is not the purpose of a controlled economy policy in extraordinary times.</p>
<p>Looking at countries around the world that have taken extraordinary measures in extraordinary times and achieved results, for example, Allied Japan has made many extraordinary achievements in the military field. What it can boast to the world most is the special attack unit of the army and navy and the Kamikaze attack unit. Their members are not military experts who are well-versed in military strategy or tactics. In terms of official rank, they are almost all lieutenants, second lieutenants, and even corporals. In terms of age, the oldest is no more than thirty years old, and the youngest is under twenty years old. However, they have become the heroes most praised by the people. This is a concrete manifestation of extraordinary action in extraordinary times. Secondly, when the Soviet Union was severely oppressed by the German army at the beginning of the German-Soviet War, most of the city of Stalin was lost, Leningrad was besieged, and Moscow was about to fall. The Soviet army was able to regain its strength and regain its advantage. The biggest reason for its success lies in the continuous promotion of new talents and young cadres, while decisively dismissing senior leaders who had been meritorious in the past but now lacked the ability to adapt to current needs. This is also the effect of extraordinary measures to promote new talents in extraordinary times.</p>
<p>There is a common saying in the Chinese officialdom called "Xiao Gui Cao Sui," which is a routine saying after a successor takes over from his predecessor. A good saying is humility, and a bad saying is blind obedience. In these extraordinary times, one must constantly seek progress and cannot have conservative ideas. Recently, the Governor of Jiangsu Province, Ren, came to Shanghai on official business. Yesterday, he made a statement on the recent situation of Jiangsu's provincial administration. However, he did not say the usual officialdom remarks. He said, "To be honest, I don't sing high-sounding tunes... Everyone works according to their duties, without exaggeration or falsehood." This proves that Ren has the determination to break established rules. We cannot help but have a new expectation for the future of Jiangsu's provincial administration.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Raiding Osaka: Over Thirty Aircraft Shot Down: General Headquarters Announces Interception Results</h3>

<h3>Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Finance Discusses: General Outline of This Year's Administration: Will Issue Public Bonds to Balance the Budget</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) – Vice Minister Chen Zhishuo of the Ministry of Finance met with Chinese and foreign reporters at 4:00 PM yesterday to report on the recent administrative situation of the ministry as follows: The organizations directly under the ministry include the Customs Administration, the Salt Administration, and the Tax Administration. The administrative situation of each of these administrations this year is:</p>
<p>(1) "Customs Administration" – Regarding customs administration, the superintendents of the Guangdong Customs and the Jianghai Customs were successively abolished. Regarding the current status of customs revenue, the customs duties in China and South China that were turned over to the national treasury in the 33rd year of the Republic amounted to more than 280 million national currency, and the amount in North China amounted to more than 31 million Lian Yin currency.</p>
<p>(2) "Salt Administration" – Due to transportation difficulties caused by the incident, tax revenue has sharply decreased. The Ministry of Finance is currently devising methods to solve the transportation problem.</p>
<p>(3) "Tax Administration" – Currently, tax revenue accounts for the first place in national tax revenue, the largest of which is the cigarette tax. The registered prices and tax rates for the cigarette tax have been increased since March 1st of this year. The tax rate in the 33rd year of the Republic was 55%, which was changed to 65% from March 1st of this year, an increase of 10%. However, according to the current situation, due to the lack of raw materials and electricity conservation, it may be difficult for the cigarette tax to reach the budget figures.</p>
<p>(4) "Matters Concerning the Ministry"</p>
<p>Taxes – The first point is that taxes in all provinces and cities can be uniformly implemented in accordance with the central government's adjustment regulations. There are still a few places where exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies exist. The Ministry is currently paying attention to adjustment. In addition, there are transit taxes and incense and candle taxes. The transit tax adopted a commissioned system in the 33rd year of the Republic, which was entrusted to the China-Japan joint venture transportation company to handle. The results varied. The Ministry of Finance is working hard to make adjustments, which have made considerable progress, currently reaching more than 40 million yuan. The incense and candle tax is a tax that was recently implemented. The collection of the incense and candle tax is handled by the General Administration. However, the Shanghai market is entrusted to the same industry association to handle it on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. The three provinces and one city directly collect the tax, collecting about 13 million yuan per month. In addition, there is a tin foil tax, which can now collect more than 3 million yuan per month. In addition, regarding the collection of commodities by local governments, the Ministry approves its implementation within the possible scope according to the actual situation of the locality. Several places have already begun to implement it, and the results are not bad. However, the collection of commodities is limited to rice and wheat.</p>
<p>Currency Department – The work of the Currency Department is to manage financial institutions. Currently, there are still new banks and money houses being established in various places. Therefore, the outside world is quite confused. The Ministry has carefully considered the matter beforehand and approved it according to the needs of the actual situation. It was indeed more lenient at the beginning, but now it is absolutely strict. In addition, efforts are being made to strengthen special financial institutions such as the insurance industry. Recently, an office for inspecting the insurance industry has been set up under the Central Reserve Bank to implement preliminary inspections. As for the amendment of the Insurance Law, the Ministry is currently drafting it. In addition, the Exchange Supervision Committee is now under the sole management of the Ministry of Finance and has established an office for exchange supervisors. Unsound stocks will never be allowed to be listed. The transaction tax has increased by nearly 4 million yuan per month.</p>
<p>Accounting – The total national budget for the first half of the 34th year of the Republic is 360 million yuan per month, but the actual income and expenditure cannot be balanced. The overdraft is about 40 million yuan. In order to balance income and expenditure and make up for the overdraft, the Ministry of Finance has decided to issue a type of domestic public bond in the 34th year of the Republic. As for the budget objects, ensuring public security is the most important, accounting for more than 60% of the total budget. The next priority is to increase production, followed by improving treatment.</p>
<p>Public Bonds and National Treasury – Regarding public bonds, it has been decided to issue domestic public bonds this year. The maximum limit for this public bond is 200 million yuan, and the amount for half a year is 100 million yuan. In addition, the second phase of the construction public bond of 30 million yuan will continue to be issued. As for the national treasury, it should be able to meet the payments until recently. Regarding the special consumption tax, the collection of the special consumption tax was originally handled directly by the Ministry of Finance. From January 1st of this year, the work of collecting the special consumption tax was entrusted to the local governments of various provinces and cities, and it was stipulated that half of the tax revenue should be turned over to the central government, while the remaining half should be used to subsidize local administrative expenses. Since its implementation, except for Beijing, which has already turned over the tax revenue, other provinces and cities have not yet turned it over. Therefore, it is not yet known what the results are. However, judging from Beijing, it is better than before. As for the tax rate, it is still the original 4%. Shanghai, due to the huge expenditure on administrative expenses, the central government has approved it to add a surcharge as a subsidy for Shanghai's administrative expenses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Zamboanga Bravely Inflict Damage on the Enemy</h3>
<p>Philippines Front, 14th (Central News Agency) – Under the cover of fierce shelling towards Zamboanga, the enemy is currently accumulating strong medicines and other supplies near the wharf airport and is attacking the Japanese positions with a strong tank force as the vanguard on the northern end of the airfield line outside the city. Upon learning this, the Japanese side inflicted damage on the enemy tank force with powerful shelling and also caused the enemy's supply depot to burn, causing the enemy forces to be in a state of chaos. Furthermore, they launched a brave surprise attack at night. Since the enemy landed until the 11th, they have killed or wounded approximately 300 enemy soldiers.</p>
<h3>Notes on the Allocation of Dongting Mountain (2)</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Population and Farmland: Dongshan is divided into four towns and six townships, with more than 9,000 households in sixteen bao and a population of more than 35,000 people. Currently, there are about 5,000 mu of farmland. Most of them are small owner-cultivators with two or three mu of land. Those with more than 100 mu of land are extremely rare. Of these 5,000 mu, mulberry fields account for almost one-third, and the rest are rice fields. Previously, "highlands" along the eastern side of Taihu Lake were originally planted with late rice, but due to the damage caused by rice stem borers, the losses were huge. Now, 70% or 80% of the land has been converted to early rice.</p>
<p>If a tenant farmer is a new household, they must pay a deposit rent of 10 yuan per mu. Old households are exempt. Last year, the rent for rice fields was one shi of unhusked rice, worth 3,000 yuan, and the rent for mulberry fields was 100 yuan per mu. If the tenant farmers pay the rent within the agreed time, the landlord will give a 10% discount out of consideration for the tenant farmers. As for the rental price for this year, it will only be known in October during the rental period. Furthermore, if tenant farmers here fail to pay the rent on time, the landlord can take back their farmland. Currently, the land price in Dongshan is about 45,000 yuan per mu, and the land price in the downtown area of the town is about 70,000 yuan per mu.</p>
<p>The area of Xishan is twice that of Dongshan, so there is also more farmland, about 22,000 mu. The entire mountain is divided into two towns and eight townships: Donghu Town, Xiaoxia Town, Litang, Huili, Zhenxia, Hanzhi, Lucun, Qixian, Qianwan, and eight townships, with a population of about 30,000 people. Donghu Town is the most prosperous place in the entire mountain, and it also has the largest population, about 4,000 people. Litang Township has the largest area and larger houses. As for Xiaoxia Town, it is the place where the King of Wu took refuge. In addition to many scenic spots, there are many fish ponds along the lake. The entire Qian is divided into Dongcai, Xicai, and Qinjabao forts, with a population of more than 10,000 people. Xishan has a large area and a sparse population. Most of the men in the villages are engaged in fishing, and most of the women are engaged in hard labor. As for the work of transplanting rice seedlings and planting rice every year, it is all done by men.</p>
<p>The land tax for both Dongshan and Xishan is 22 jin of grain per mu. According to the regulations, the official stipulation is to collect commodities in kind. However, in reality, the chiefs of each township only collect cash from farmers at market prices, and then buy grain with the money and hand it over to the county government. In addition to this amount, the "Dongshan Land Tax Collection Office" also has to collect a 10% handling fee. According to the reporter's investigation, since the land tax was levied last year, only one-tenth of the expected total amount has been collected to date, which is due to the failure to establish public security in the area.</p>
<p>In addition, the local self-governing organizations have a method of collecting household subsidy fees from the people to run local public undertakings. Currently, each household pays about 300 to 2,000 yuan, and the poor are exempt.</p>
<p>Firewood, Rice, Medicine: Dongting Mountain, on the surface, is no less than a peach blossom paradise in a chaotic world, but after a little research, the internal crisis is extremely large. Here are a few things to illustrate:</p>
<p>(1) Rice is the staple food of the people of Dongting Mountain. About 250 dan of rice are consumed every day. However, the local farmland is limited, and the rice produced is only enough to supply one month's needs. Therefore, the source of rice is all dependent on Xujing, Henan (belonging to Zhejiang), Mudu, Changxing and other places, especially Changxing. If the source is interrupted, panic will arise immediately. On the day the reporter arrived, the price of rice was originally 32,000 yuan, but due to the influence of the price of rice in Suzhou (about 50,000 yuan), many people in Dongshan secretly transported rice to Suzhou, resulting in a surge in the local price of rice, creating a phenomenon of having a market but no rice. On March 7, the villagers in Houshan Township could not buy rice and were in a state of panic. Fortunately, there was a foreign rice boat in the village. The boat owner went to the front mountain to inquire about the market price and refused to sell it immediately. The villagers gathered by the boat and forced them to open the warehouse and land, otherwise they would sink the boat with huge rocks. The rice merchant finally surrendered, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not help. If rice boats do not come here in the future, the food supply of Dongting Mountain will become a problem. On the day the reporter left the mountain, the rice panic increased rather than decreased, and the price of rice also rose to 46,000 yuan. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>China Railway Formulates Measures to Crack Down on Unscrupulous Employees; Approved for Implementation by the Ministry of Construction</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In view of the fact that a small number of unscrupulous employees of the Central China Railway Company frequently engage in improper behavior, the Ministry of Construction ordered the company in January of this year to formulate measures to crack down on illegal acts by employees. After the Ministry of Construction approved the implementation of the measures, the measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: In view of the fact that company employees' customer service attitude during passengers' travels is often criticized, these measures are specially formulated to eliminate criticism and achieve a clear travel purpose.</p>

<p>Article 3: Company employees shall not accept bribes from passengers or cargo owners for any reason.</p>
<p>Article 4: If it is found that employees who directly contact passengers use the excuse of checking passenger tickets to threaten and extort money from passengers, they will be disciplined and dismissed.</p>
<p>Article 5: Employees who directly contact passengers should conduct themselves in a serious and impartial manner. If passengers are found to have irregularities, they should be handled in accordance with railway regulations. However, if passengers commit irregularities due to not understanding the actual situation and without malicious intent, they should be strongly guided to get back on the right track. In the event of any of the foregoing incidents, forced abuse or bribery for private handling is not allowed.</p>
<p>Article 6: When passengers request to consign luggage in accordance with proper procedures, baggage handlers should promptly accept and handle it, and shall not engage in improper acts such as forcing money, deliberately making things difficult, or deliberately damaging luggage.</p>

<p>Article 9: The director of the administration bureau should constantly pay great attention to the actions of the employees under his jurisdiction, and secretly dispatch inspectors at any time and place, so that unscrupulous employees have no room for mischief. If any improper behavior is discovered, investigate the facts severely, and if the case is serious, send it to the police for severe punishment, or dismiss the employee; if the case is minor, impose disciplinary action or reduce salary. Those who are dismissed due to misconduct will have their qualification to work for Central China Railway revoked.</p>

<h3>Changes in Lending Policy of Local Banks and Money Shops; Significant Meaning for Eradicating Speculation</h3>
<p>Recently, major banks and money shops in the city have made many new changes in the operation of their lending business. It is understood that mortgage loans for movable property, immovable property, controlled goods, daily necessities, and legitimate commodities have been rejected. The reason for the rejection is that the term is too long, the funds are affected by stagnation, and it is difficult to use them actively. Therefore, they are now trying to accept short-term bill discounting and special interbank lending and other lending businesses, which have a very short term, high profits, and are most suitable for the conditions of funds being active at any time. The amount of funds used is also dispersed in many aspects, and it is relatively easy to recover and release. As for borrowers, if the amount is small, the interest and handling fees are also low; if the amount is large, the interest and handling fees are proportionally higher, which makes it difficult for customers to bear. It is heard that this move has significant meaning for eradicating speculation and hoarding and suppressing prices.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau to Issue Retirement Pay Today; All to be Issued Within the Week</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau will issue retirement pay of two to six months to those who have been eliminated in the recent personnel cuts. It has ordered each branch and team to report a list of the eliminated personnel. The calculations have now been completed for ten branches, including Xinshijie, Jing'an Temple, Putuo Road, West Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Yulin Road, Huashan Road, Taishan Road, and Yimiao. It is scheduled to be issued to the supervisors of each branch at 11:00 a.m. on the 15th of this month for separate distribution on the same day. Except for Hongkou, Changning Road, Yangsi, Dongchang Road, and Yangjing, which have not yet reported, the remaining units will continue to distribute from the 16th, and it is expected that all will be issued within this week.</p>
<p>French Police Officers Dismissed En Masse - The Municipal Police Bureau has ordered the dismissal of all 119 French police officers yesterday. In addition, in order to adjust personnel, a portion of the redundant staff has been eliminated. At the same time, in order to strictly review personnel, those who have committed crimes and been sentenced in the past will not be hired. Therefore, the Crime Prevention Section of the Third Division has been ordered to re-examine the fingerprints of current staff. If there are police officers with prior convictions, regardless of their position or rank, they will all be dismissed, and it is stipulated that fingerprints must be examined when hiring people in the future.</p>
<h3>Construction Bureau to Re-inspect Cars and Boilers</h3>

It is stipulated that commercial vehicles should be concentrated at the bureau's Hankou Road for inspection, and commercial trucks should be concentrated at the bureau's Jiangning Road vehicle registration office for inspection.</p>
<h3>Educational Circles Distribute Rice Coupons for the Second Period</h3>
<p>The rice coupons for the second period of affordable rice for educational circles are scheduled to be distributed today (15th) and tomorrow (16th).

<h3>Governor Ren of Jiangsu Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss the General Situation of Jiangsu Provincial Administration; Six Organizations in the City Hold Tea Party Today to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Ren Yuandao, Governor of Jiangsu Province, has made many contributions to the construction of Jiangsu's provincial administration. Ren recently arrived in Shanghai on official business. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Administration Advisory Committee, the Citizens Welfare Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Press Association, the Charitable Corps, and the Suzhou Association of Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai, in order to express their welcome to Ren, will hold a welcome tea party this afternoon (15th). The following is a record of Ren's speech on the Jiangsu provincial administration:</p>
<p>"I was specially appointed by the National Government on November 10 last year to take over the position of Governor of Jiangsu Province and Director of the Pacification of Jiangsu. It has been four months since I took office. I have long wanted to come to Shanghai to meet with leaders and old friends from all sides. However, due to the complexity of miscellaneous affairs, I have not been able to fulfill my wishes as soon as possible. I am deeply ashamed of being taken care of by all walks of life.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province is adjacent to Shanghai, located in the heart of the Yangtze River Delta, with beautiful mountains and rivers, and was originally known as the granary. After the return to the capital, the National Government authorities and the general compatriots also have the most ardent expectations for all reconstruction. Since the first implementation of Qingxiang in the summer of the 30th year of the Republic of China, all facilities and improvements have attracted the attention of both China and foreign countries. I have only been in office for a short time, and I am ashamed to say that I have no achievements to speak of. Now I would like to briefly report on the general provincial administration that is sufficient for you to hear:</p>
<p>(1) Public Security and Production</p>
<p>Since Qingxiang, thanks to the cooperation of the National Army stationed in the province, local teams, and allied forces, the suppression of bandits has been very effective, so the public security situation in the province can be said to be good. I was ordered to also take charge of pacification, and I immediately actively sought to improve the treatment of the military and police under my jurisdiction, enrich preparations, strengthen training, improve quality, and pay special attention to the correction of military discipline. At the same time, I deployed joint defense in various counties, rectified the people's Baojia self-defense, and created a spirit and system of unity between the military and the people. The activities of bad elements have been eradicated, so that we can devote all our efforts to increasing production from the establishment of public security. Regarding increased production, this province currently has jurisdiction over 23 counties in Jiangnan. Last year, the output of rice was about 25,183,892 piculs, wheat was about 5,084,560 piculs, and other miscellaneous grains and soybeans, etc., were all harvested in large quantities. There was a slight increase compared to the previous year. In addition to providing purchases for the Rice Unification Council, there is still no need to worry about the food supply for the people of this province.</p>
<p>(2) Finance and Taxation</p>
<p>It is generally said that Jiangsu Province is a rich area, and its finances are better than other places, but in fact, with the amount of income and expenditure being huge, it is always difficult. However, what can be pointed out responsibly is: (1) The implementation of in-kind collection of land tax has increased the provincial treasury revenue by more than 500% compared to the previous year. (2) The budget for the first half of this year in the province will reach 800,000,000,000 yuan, all on the condition that the burden on the people is not increased, and balance is sought. (3) Completely eliminate the accumulated malpractices in tax collection, and cancel the so-called positive and negative ratio evils for tax包稅 people. Those who steal and evade taxes will be investigated and dealt with seriously according to the law. For example, the amount of consumption special tax increased four times more than the previous year after the department handed it over to the province. (4) The Jiangsu Local Bank, which acts as the provincial treasury, always ensures that the amount of deposits reaches 10,000,000,000 yuan. It actively promotes the operation of foreign trade in the province and the promotion of industry and commerce in the province. And in order to meet the needs of increased production, it is willing to make its best efforts for rural loans. Economic and financial management is gradually on the right track, which can be gratifying to you.</p>
<p>(3) Education and Construction</p>
<p>I have always attached importance to education. I have said that the country has many difficulties. It is better to run more schools than to organize more troops. For the future of the nation, those who govern in troubled times should work hard. Therefore, on New Year's Day this year, I announced that strengthening education is the focus of provincial administration facilities. Now, education in this province has restored the scale before the incident in terms of quantity, but due to the difficulties of talent and equipment, there are still many areas that need to be worked on in terms of content. Teaching staff have long been treated equally with civil servants, such as planning the distribution of daily necessities, temporary living subsidies, special life insurance, etc., have all been implemented. Although it cannot be completely ideal, it is still gratifying. As for construction, in order to adapt to the needs of wartime, such as the construction of highways, the improvement and management of public utilities, and the supervision of mines, fisheries, animal husbandry, agricultural reclamation, and sericulture, are all being promoted at an accelerated pace.</p>
<p>(4) Personnel and Other</p>
<p>I belong to the military and am accustomed to military service. This time I was ordered to serve my hometown and was supervised by all walks of life. I hope that the local elders expect that I will do everything I can to do what should be done. The so-called spirit of a soldier, I am willing to practice it, tell the truth and do not need to sing high-pitched tunes. Now the Greater East Asia War is approaching the decisive stage. We should abide by the National Government's policy as the basis for administration, and strive to strengthen and develop local military and politics under the three major goals of establishing public security, increasing production, and correcting thought. This is the key to winning the final victory. Fortunately, my subordinates, colleagues, or veterans, or scholars, or young people, can all understand the meaning of unity and calmness, and each of them can stick to their posts and work without exaggeration or falsehood. I hope you will give more criticism and encouragement. Qingming is approaching, and the spring is bright. If you are interested in visiting Jiangsu, I will always sweep the couch to wait for your instructions.</p>

At that time, Baojia work in each district will be discussed.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Refutes Reclamation Company for Speculation</h3>
<p>Citizen Xu Daoxiu, in the name of China Reclamation Co., Ltd., petitioned the Municipal Finance Bureau in the name of supporting national policies and promoting wartime production to rent 20 mu of land at Zhaojiabang in Xujiahui Road for reclamation. The Finance Bureau forwarded the petition to the Municipal Government for approval. The Municipal Government found that Xu Daoxiu had previously obtained many plots of wasteland in the city from the former Grain Bureau in the name of China Reclamation Co., Ltd. After examining its operating methods, it was nothing more than subletting the obtained land to farmers for cultivation, sharing the autumn harvest, and profiting from it, causing repeated disputes. This time, he again applied to the Finance Bureau to rent nearby land, and at the same time, he used the name of Fuxing Commercial Market to petition the Municipal Government, saying that it was to build a commercial market to revitalize the market. The Municipal Government believed that the petitioner's purpose was purely speculation for profit, and that China Reclamation Co., Ltd. had not been approved for registration by the Ministry of Industry, so it had strictly refuted it.</p>
<h3>Taizhou Fellow Townsmen Evacuate</h3>

Tickets inside the field are sold by the Third Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross and the Southeast Hospital, and all proceeds will be allocated to the expenses of each hospital. It is found that the football skills of the Overseas Chinese United Team and the Portuguese Merchants are both outstanding among the Western teams, and the game is bound to be wonderful.</p>
<h3>Enemy American Losses Increase, Fighting Strength Decreases: Minister Idebuchi's Remarks to Reporters</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 14th, the Japanese Army Press Department of the Allied Nations, as usual, met with Chinese reporters at the Hamilton House. Minister Idebuchi reported on the extensive losses suffered by the enemy Americans on both the Eastern and Western fronts. His remarks were as follows:</p>
<p>Our Belief in Certain Victory Grows Stronger: During the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet on March 10, Prime Minister Koiso's response and the speeches of the Ministers of the Army and Navy both stated that the Japanese Imperial military and civilians had long been united, determined to defeat the British and Americans and establish a strong position. The enemy Americans, due to heavy losses, intend to pursue a short-term decisive battle, but the unwavering belief in victory of the entire Japanese military and civilian population means that if the enemy attacks, they will undoubtedly be annihilated. It is reported that American military leaders are currently meeting in Washington to discuss operational plans against Japan. Although the purpose of their operations is still unknown, it is clear that they will face extreme difficulties in the future. According to Nimitz, the enemy Americans spent the same amount on the Battle of Iwo Jima as they did on the Battle of Peleliu, showing the magnitude of their expenditure. According to American newspaper reports, within two hours of the enemy American landing on Iwo Jima, the first unit suffered 25% casualties, and the second unit suffered over 22% casualties. The battle on Iwo Jima is still fierce, and the enemy Americans will continue to make massive blood sacrifices. Recently, the enemy has been promoting landings on the Japanese mainland or the Chinese mainland. Regardless of where they land, the sacrifices will be great. Such blind actions, making pointless sacrifices, are meaningless, and the enemy will eventually realize their mistake.</p>
<p>Enemy Americans Admit to Heavy Losses: Currently, the enemy Americans have suffered enormous losses in human resources on both the Eastern and Western fronts. According to an American broadcast on February 28, there are more than 600,000 wounded soldiers in American hospitals. Due to a shortage of nurses, a resolution to conscript nurses was passed in Congress. Furthermore, a bill to send 18-year-old men to the front lines after only eight months of short training was passed despite public opposition, because of the severe manpower shortage. The American draft board, without authorization, began drafting 38-year-old men who had already retired from essential military industries. As seen from the American broadcast above, their manpower shortage has reached an extreme point.</p>
<p>Moreover, Congressman Kara of the U.S. House of Representatives published an article in a British economics magazine comparing the losses of Britain and the United States, stating that the United States has already sacrificed more than seven million soldiers and spent thirty trillion dollars in war expenses. People are often misled by enemy American propaganda and overestimate American fighting power. Their losses in the European theater and the Pacific War are very significant, and their fighting power is decreasing. The enemy's recent strategic propaganda aims to end the war quickly, and their purpose is obvious. The more frantically and blindly the enemy Americans advance, the more intense the attacks they will encounter from our side, and the greater their losses will be.</p>
<h3>Reader Scholarship News</h3>
<p>Memorial Donation for Scholarship in Honor of Respected Parent: Dr. Zhu Shaoyun, in memory of his late father, established the "Ziyun Scholarship" in the previous session. This newspaper selected three outstanding and impoverished university students and two high school students, and Mr. Zhu generously covered all their tuition and fees. This session, the program continues, with the addition of one more university student, totaling six students. A total of 182,260 yuan in scholarships has been delivered to this office and will be distributed to the students. Mr. Zhu's filial piety is inexhaustible, and he uses "cultivating talents" as a memorial to his late father. We respectfully express our gratitude on behalf of the recipient students.</p>
<p>Appointment Celebration Gifts Used for Scholarship Funds: Yao Benyuan writes in a letter: "Respectfully informing you, I was transferred from Bian to Shanghai in the 18th year of the Republic and have served as a police officer for over a decade. I have never taken anything improperly, not even gifts. Local people are likely aware of this. Now that I have taken office as the head of the Changning Road Police Station, I have received many generous gifts from various manufacturers and colleagues, which I am grateful for. Aside from maintaining my consistent principles and returning all gifts, the Yutong Tobacco Factory and Hailong Paper Mill, in particular, have repeatedly offered gifts that I could not refuse. To firmly reject them would be disrespectful, but to accept them would violate my original intentions. Therefore, I have decided to donate the 36,000 yuan in celebration gifts to the Shen and Xin newspapers, 18,000 yuan each, to be used as scholarship funds to aid impoverished students and to create blessings for the colleagues at Yutong and Hailong factories."</p>
<p>Herman School Music Concert Concludes</p>
<p>The concert organized by Mr. Paul, Principal of Herman School of Harmonica, was held on the morning of March 4th at the Majestic Theatre. Yesterday, a letter reported the financial details: total income was 674,000 yuan, total expenses were 615,900 yuan, and the school donated 16,300 yuan, for a total of 74,400 yuan. This sum will be donated to the Shen and Xin newspapers as scholarship funds, 37,200 yuan each.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper Establishes Free Elementary Schools: Saving Out-of-School Children and Supporting Teachers' Livelihoods</h3>
<p>Previously, this office, in order to assist elementary school teachers in their professional development, held a winter vacation workshop for elementary school teachers, which was enthusiastically attended by many teachers. Now, to further cooperate with elementary school teachers, on the one hand, to rescue out-of-school children, and on the other hand, to supplement teachers' livelihoods, we are establishing free elementary schools with tuition waivers. Regarding funding, we have already consulted with the charity market and agreed to allocate special funds. A Shen Bao Free Education Committee has been established to handle this matter exclusively, and committee members have also been appointed.</p>
<p>We plan to establish ten free elementary schools in various districts of the city. We are currently negotiating for school buildings. We welcome any schools that are willing to provide space. In order to save expenses, we are launching a campaign to collect used books. All elementary school textbooks, regardless of spring or autumn semester, are needed.
