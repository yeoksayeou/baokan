<h3>橫須賀及關東區空襲　日空軍展開邀擊　擊落毀艦載敵機一百餘架</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　橫須賀鎭司令部十九日發表稱：十八日敵艦載機倆襲橫須賀軍港時，日方收穫之戰果，截止十九日上午六時止，經判明者計擊落四十架，擊毀三十八架。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　十八日來要關東地區各地及橫須軍港之敵艦載機，累計達九百架，日陸海軍所獲戰果，計擊落七十五架，擊毀四十六架，共百二十一架，日方地上幾無損害。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　敵機動部隊本日未悉何故，未以艦載機來襲日本土，抑或退避於日本空軍勢力圈外，日本航空部隊十八日對來襲之敵艦載機，到處展開果敢之邀擊戰，獲得戰果頗大，現業經判明襲贅八十架，擊毀五十三架，且某處擊落來談敵機約三十架，同日夜間十二時許，敵少數小型艦艇對房總南端之白賓附近漁村實施艦炮射擊，約十分鐘之久，自射民房後，遂行遁去，日方幾未損害。</p>

<h3>日派遣軍總司令官　岡村大將發表談話　撤兵應以停戰爲前提對食糧問題儘量協助</h3>
<p>申央社訊　大陸新報載，日駐華派遣軍總司令官岡村大將，本月九日下午三時在南京偕行社招待首都宜傳報道當局，就目前一般戰局國述頗詳，並披　派遣軍作戰之決心，茲補誌是日大將談話要點如下：</p>
<p>中國最近言論界一部分人士戰吹日軍撤兵少說，然所謂撤兵，有二點須加考慮，第一，撤兵應以停戰爲前提，否則未見其功，反先致混亂。現在之戰爭，並非日本與中國間之戰，而係重慶以美國爲背後勢力之戰，情勢如此，撤兵自難許可。第二，縱令日本離開以上問題，開始撤兵，亦非短期問內所可竣事，日本將士武裝撤退，約需時二年，且因美空軍攬亂交通，期間將不得不延長，是故不考慮如上之戰術，貿然撤兵，爲我人所不取。</p>
<p>關於敵人接岸作戰，余抱兩個矛盾之情感，一方面余爲中國之鄰邦人，中國國土之荒廢，不禁替中國民衆痛心，他方爲迅速覆減美國之太平洋戰略，又希望美軍之登陸，更歡迎美軍之早來，對於大東亞戰爭，余抱有獲得最後勝利之決意與自信。</p>
<p>延安現在之作風，固有改變之必要，惟余認延安亦非與中國絕對不相容之政權，　延關係，爲一國內問題，余不願喋喋置論，然重慶依賴他國解決國內問題之　　，殊非所宜</p>
<p>糧食問題，經結在於收買方法之不完全及輸送之不圓滑，改善之岡，固爲中國政府之賣任，然日本方面亦有責任，派遣軍今後仍將儘量協助，中國糧食前途，料可安心也</p>
<h3>美軍次期　作戰企圖</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社一電　　制沖繩戰　大勢之敵美軍，積極整備駭島之船空基地，同時與馬里亞積基地，硫黃島基地相呼應，旬日以來迎日對日本本土全域以B29。B24。P51等　爲基幹之戰鬥轟炸聯合航空兵力，　固對本土之軍事生產設施或中小都市實施戰席，戰術轟炸，一方　於冲繩職綫企圖再度候復其已喪失二分之一兵力之機動部隊，自十日以來，向本土近海侵犯，該日對關東地區，十四日。十五日兩日對東北及北海道南部地區，又十七日對關東及東北地區之一部來襲，同時以一部艦船對釜石。室蘭加以本土最初之艦砲射擊，若以此即認爲敵美軍之企圖對本土登陸作戰，則其見識不免過於幼稚。敵機動部隊向本土近海游弋，對日飛機塲等軍事設施及港灣•船舶加以機槍掃射，此爲本土登陸戰之前哨航空戰，至爲明顯，敵企岡一而偵察本土之航空兵力，一面分散消耗日航空兵力，蓋敵機動部隊此次之行動，以硫黃島基地之航空戰略，內戰略戰術轟炸不能十分順利，乃對地域加以補足攻擊，並同時破壞日重要生產設施，而使生產滅低，　亂人心，以獲心理的效果。日方因早已究成對敵整備防禦　勢，以阻敵之前進，受艦載機之損害，極其整微。敵之出擊，乃告完全失敗，故感焦慮，査最近敵機動部隊行動，含有登陸新作戰之意味，惟此次敵機動部隊侵寇之用意，尙不能判斷次期之戰略及意圖。按敵之次期戰略，若以本土登陸昨戰爲目標，則因現有之馬里亞綱。硫磺島。沖繩之敵航空基地距離過遠，爲使此等航空基地擴大强化，乃謀在接近本土之地點獲得航空基地後，再實施登陸。又逾整備中繩基地之同時，敵自該地區及非律賓基地實施大陸空襲，最近顯見活躍化，則敵人對於該方而之戰略的，政略的登陸企岡，不難充分測知，惟大陸日軍早已完成萬全準備，集中戰力，以待對敵軍給予迎頭痛擊，敵人登陸企圖決難得逞。</p>
<h3>日海軍省發表　特攻隊攻績　榮譽勇士共二三六名</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　據日海軍省十八日發表，聯合艦隊司令長官，頃因神風特攻隊各隊員於沖繩島周邊擊滅敵機動部隊及艦船集國，獲致偉大勳績，特布告全軍，計此次被發表樂譽之勇士二百三十六名，其中並含有身處火箭式小型飛機，由母機起飛，誓死出動轟沉敵艦之神雷隊員。按對神雷部隊之特攻崇高精神，昭示世界，布告全軍者，此次係第二次，計共擊沉毀艦船六百餘艘，舉歷史上未曾有之大戰果，便沖繩作戰收獲燦爛戰果，敵方所受重大損害，皆係此等特攻勇士之功績。</p>
<h3>三巨頭會議　前途暗礁蘊藏　軍事評論家論世界政局</h3>
<p>本市軍事評論家，頃就最近世界政局情勢，作詳切之評論如次：</p>
<h3>三頭會議和平前提</h3>
<p>關於英美蘇三巨頭會議，因史太林之姗姗來遲，其間似有安礁蘊藏。頃據英美方面傳稱，謂此次之三頭會議，有如雅爾達會議之東亞版，亦即可謂將來和平之前提。査明年初將舉行和平會議，此次三巨頭會議即係預備會　。此次會議之經過情形，至今緘默未聞，其程序原定十六日舉行會議，終因史太林之來遲，以致延後一日。十六日晨，美總統特魯曼起床後，即與國務長官彭斯及幕僚等協商，旋始拜會一英相邱吉爾，而史太林雖行蹤秘密，深信渠已於十六日午後抵彼次坦。茲據又一傳稱，是日特魯曼與邱吉爾在波次坦曾作非正式之會議，同時英美兩國之幕僚，亦互相交換意見，並稱史太林與特魯曼於十七日作首次會談時，對世界各重要問題有所硏究，且又約邱吉爾會晤云云。茲據十入日電稱，特魯曼首先與邱吉爾共進午膳，午後特魯曼訪問史太林作二次會談。此次會議，不准記者參加，幷禁止發表新聞，而美國陸軍部軍事普及官約翰中校發表報道稱，該次之會議，本過去之措置進行。査該會議之前，有渝宋子文之赴莫斯科，訪問史太林，從中周旋，嗣史在預定日期遲延一日到會，基於上述事實，乃益足證三巨會議前途，實有暗礁蘊議。</p>
<h3>太平洋上敵美動向</h3>
<p>關於今後美軍在太平洋上之動向，據十七日紐約泰晤士報所稱，英美軍究向何處登陸，將遵照富局之決定，但指出在下期作戰中，以向中國大陸登陸較有可能性，惟對目本內地則積極從事轟炸云云。至於日本之戰力及航空兵力，根據敵方所發表，說明日本之低下工廠生產，相富進展，存矃亦極豐富，且根據過去日本之赫赫戰果以及特攻精神之昂揚，以一殺百之武功，　驚世界，有如此之雄厚實力，當不願輕舉妄動。故有人言，一旦敵人開始侵犯日本土登陸時，日將舉所有人力及航空機，向敵迎頭痛擊，屆時敵所這遇之損害，必較過去沖繩島數倍以上之慘重，此可不難想像者。查日本爲解放東亞民族，謀東亞建設爲入紘一宇之新天地，除一將英美在日本中國之勢力予以消滅，並永遠騙出東亞之外，中日兩國及全東亞民族，均當永久保持信念，在同一目標下，向建設東亞新天地之途遇進。</p>
<h3>印英會議談判決裂</h3>
<p>關於印西姆拉會談宣告決裂，其經過已由英在印之事務大臣阿梅萊向下院說明，會議餘六月二十五日開始，討論事項如下：　印總督之行政院陸軍大臣重職，由印人充任，而司令長官，亦須有印人擔負編成。　行政院中實施印人主張印度大剛。　任命派遣海外之新任印人外交管。查過去克里浦斯曾爲戰後可知印度呼籲，但至今毫無進展，此項新提議之目的，乃促成印度自洽政體，予以獨立。於該日星期以正式開會起，至七月十四日方始休會。當印總　　維爾最初主張選舉行政院委員，以會議派回敎從聯盟會員爲候補者。幷要求造報名單，詎至休會之日，華維爾僅說明大會經過情形，加之回敎聯明總裁琴那，亦未保障回敎聯盟會員之入選，乃狐疑陷於停頓狀態中。最後結論，由華絡爾敷衍加以考盧決定，一面並稱爲維持安民順序，故新案不易產生。總之，英國以印人作爲犧牲，一貫對印實施殖民政策，此項暴政，以榨取印人之利益。過去在首次歐戰時，曾假允印度之獨立，至今猶未實踐諾言，鑒諸前例，英國將始終不予印度以眞正之獨立。</p>
<h3>塔那底島　日軍創敵</h3>
<p>塔那底島前綫基地十九日中央社電　掃蕩殘敵之塔那底島方面日軍，其後復減低兵二百名，大致已完成該島掃蕩戰。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地十九日中央社電掃蕩塔那底島敵登陸之日軍部隊，自十一日得有援兵來助後，逐次向西岸方面壓制敵軍，十二日後迄今已殺傷敵兵約二百名，又敵登陸以來，殺傷敵兵五百名。</p>
<h3>日軍需省職權　移讓與地方</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電日軍需省此次決將法令職權移讓與地方，於二十日公布，即時實施，移讓對象爲各種軍事共通適用至法令，例如防空法，企業整備令，金屬類收回法令，軍需會社法工塲，事業塲管理物資統制令，國民緊急動員令，重要事業塲勞務管理令，工資統制令，工塲法戰時特令等，將該省所有之大部權限，移讓與地方畏官。地方軍需管理畏官，地方礦山局長，地方燃料局長砭都長官，府縣長官實施當塲決定之軍需生產行政，以增加辦事上之效率。</p>
<h3>蘇滬公路　積極修築</h3>
<p>蘇州十九日中央社電　蘇滬公路之修築事宜，自本省建設總工程處開始修築以來，進行極（爲緊張，雖天時酷熱非常，但連日修築工事一般情形，均頗良好，建工處方面數次指派監工人員，冒暑督察，務使路面橋標之修築適合原定計對，完成日期，尚有數週。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>柏林三頭會議</h3>
<p>特魯曼、邱吉爾、史太林等三頭會議，已於七月十七日下午五時起，在柏林西南三十二公里的波期丹古城莫愁離宮內舉行。這次會議，是在歐洲戰爭已告結束，而且有關歐洲的最大問題如波蘭問題等都巳解決的新環境中舉行的，因此，會議的內容，顯然和以前兩次三頭會議，有極大的差别之處，而特別値得我們身處東方的人們予以警戒的注視。</p>
<p>一九四三年冬的德黑蘭三頭會議，是標傍軍事第一的國際最高戰略會談，結果是一九四四年六月六日的北法登陸，第二戰綫的開聞。一九四五年二月雅爾達的第二次三頭會議，是軍事和政治兼重的國際最高會談，結果，在軍事上有本年五月八日的德國無條件投降的悲劇，在政治上有本年四月二十五日至六月二十六日的舊金山會議，通過了聯合國憲章。第一次會談的中心以歐洲問題爲限，第二次會議漸擴展而至歐洲以外問題。</p>
<p>但是，現在第三次會議的性質和以前二次大不相同了。主要的是第一，這次會談，軍事的意義巳降至次要的地位；第二，這次會談，國際政洽的課題，巳提到了第一位；第三。柬亞問題，開始成爲這次會議中極顯要的議題了。</p>
<p>綜合截至目前爲止，所獲各方面的消息，可見這次柏林三頭會議的主要議題，　爲德國處理方案，因爲克里米亞雅爾達會議所決丈的對德方案，巳和目前的形勢不適，今後關於對德統治的具體辦法、駐兵及共管的時期，以及期滿後關於德國自由獨立問題，都將在這次會議中決定共同的根本方針。　爲建設歐洲新秩序問題，包括對於德國、義大利及洪牙利、奧地利、挪威、芬蘭等國的處理方案等。　地中海及巴爾幹諸國問題，尤其是以的里雅斯德港爲中心的英美南義間的衝突，以希臘馬其賴國境問題爲中心的希、南、保、阿與英蘇間的衝突，以丹吉雨自治區爲中心的英法乃至美蘇間的衝突等等。　近東及中東問題，如以叙利亞問題爲中心的英法衝突，以巴勒斯坦問題猶阿兩族問題爲中心的英美法蘇衝突，以伊朗伊拉克等石油問題爲中心的英美蘇聯問的衝突，乃至整個阿拉伯各國問的問題等。　遠東問題，即以中日問題爲中心的英美渝蘇間的對立。</p>
<p>在這許多問題中，我們最關心的自然是最後一個關於東亞的問題。英美渝三方而，夢想了多年的，即關於日蘇關係的突變，他們誰也希望在這次三頭會談中獲得實現。會議以前宋子文在舊金山和華盛頓的活動，以及他回抵重慶後又遄赴莫斯科進行會議，這裏不僅可以看出重慶的態度，同時也可以看出英美對於東亞問題的焦急。因爲東亞戰爭的持久，對於他們所侈言的全世界和與安全機構，實在是最無情的譏刺！</p>
<p>然則，這個問題，粗淺的看來，只待史太林的一言半語了？其實也不盡然！史太林是一個現實主義者。史太林在這裹，可以從容選擇對蘇聯和世界最有利的條件。而事實又很明顯，這種符合他要求的條件，决不是再度驅使久戰而疲的紅軍去作戰，反而坐失種種有利的機會。所以，別的不說，單就東亞問題來推測，特魯曼邱吉爾挑撥新戰禍的詭計，一定會在這次三頭會議中失敗。</p>
<h3>峇厘巴三馬林達公路二側展開激戰　日軍守備隊實行果敢夜襲</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地十九日中央社電　日。美兩軍現正於峇厘巴板三馬林達公路兩側展開激戰，該方面戰局熾烈異常，十五日敵以猛烈砲擊及空軍轟炸掩護下，焚燒密林地帶，前來攻擊，日守備隊是日施行果敢夜襲，殺傷敵兵百五十名，將敵機退。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地十九日中央社電　美。澳軍於峇厘巴板登陸以來，雖已渝二週，然仍未能攻陷據守市街後方丘陵地帶之日軍陣地，敵數次來攻，悉一遭日軍强烈反擊，徒增死尙，三馬林達公路之敵軍，僅前進八公里，然亦因日軍反擊，而遭重大打擊，而丘陵地帶因受敵之艦砲及其他各種火砲等熾烈轟炸，故亦化爲平原。然日軍指揮官以下全體將兵，士氣盆形旺盛，現已完全阻止敵軍前進，反之，敵軍則因犧牲過衆，致戰意頗爲沮喪，現巳停止攻擊，尃事收拾死傷者。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地十九日中央社電　峇厘巴板方面之戰况，仍極激烈，七月一日敵於猛烈之砲擊與轟炸拖護下，由空中降下空挺部隊，此時，印地西安人義勇隊長某，即率部下突入敵中，予以敵重創後，已身亦因遭敵轟炸壯烈陣亡。</p>

<p>南一方前綫基地十八日中央社電　敵方之謀略宣傳，隨同武力戰而活躍，尤以對於南方各地城印地西安之謀略宣傳最近益形顯著，如本月十一日敵方之前綫廣播，援崙厘巴板戰綫之例，以敵軍登陸時施行艦砲射擊及轟炸爲題材，播弄彼等常套手段之卑劣，捏造廣播，希國煽動印地西安人對日軍之惡感。又最近觀於東印地西安敵之暴虐狀况，不勝枚舉，如六月二十九日敵機轟炸峇厘巴板市街時，以敎會及學校爲對象，段傷無辜之兒童。六月十一六日於巴吉厲恩之掃射，一破壞中央回教寺院，七月一二日在泗水之盲炸印地西安人醫院，十一日又掃射該地公立學校，此外，並射殺從事增產食糧之擊夫。又在西里伯，婆羅洲，爪哇沿岸各地，隨手轟炸及掃射帆船等，凡此種種暴行，已足使印地西安人痛心，對於彼等滅視東亞人，均深抱不平，而不信敵方之巧詞。</p>
<h3>大島島空襲</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地十九日中央社電　敵體戴機約百五十架，十八日晨起至下午三時間，來襲大鳥島，經日軍邀擊，擊落其一架，日方損害輕微。</p>
<h3>實部促各地　組米穀公會</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電實業部鑒於新穀即將登塲，各地米穀業同業公會工作，亟須積極展開，然各地米穀業同業公會，自於本年四月從分區制改以縣市爲單位，重新組織後，迄今尚有多數縣市未能組織完成，日前該部特分兩各省政府，轉飭所屬，限於七月二十一日以前，分別以縣市爲單位，迅速成立米穀業同業公會。</p>
<h3>緬日軍轉取攻勢渡喜丹河追擊中</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地十九日中央社電渡越喜丹河轉取攻勢之日軍，於轉輯之間，攻破敵軍堅陣，未追稍息，即迫擊敗敵，輯續前進，予敵軍莫大傷害，現正積極擴大戰果中。緣日軍十九勵拂　曾完全攻陷宗加修及梅邱之敵陣，其後於該二地確保堅强據　，開始劇烈之肉搏攻擊件戰，且以多數之肉搏隊急追敗敵，陸續擴天戰果。又日軍自開始喜丹河渡河作戰以來，至本日止，經判明之戰果如次：殺傷敵軍一千餘名，擊墜飛機兩架，鹵獲軍需品多數（梅邱戰果不在其內）。</p>
<h3>蘇省府積極動員勞工</h3>
<p>蘇州十九日中央社電　蘇省府爲確立戰時體制，動員各縣民衆起見，特在建應設置勞工科，數月以來，在任省長領導之下，積極動員勞工，從事建設工作，成績極爲美滿。並在各縣府，亦一律設置勞工科，現者府正積極計劃，强化勞工組織，管理職工團體，使之從事公路及防空之建設，藉以吸收社會一部過剩勞力，且可減少失業，洵屬一舉二得之耍政。</p>
<h3>民訓部召開　工作談話會</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電中央黨部民團訓練部爲商討推進民訓工作，定二十日上午十時在該部大禮堂舉行民訓工作談話會，蘇。浙。皖。淮四省及京。滬兩市黨部所派之常委一人及民訓處長，均於十九日攜帶提案及工作報告，先後來京報到。屆時將由梅部長及王，劉兩副部長親自主持，該部各高級職員，亦均出席與議。</p>
<h3>波次坦會議　討論各要按</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　據路透特派派訪員談稱：在波次坦召開之三頭會議，業於昨日黃昏時正式開始討論各項要題，三國參謀長及外長間之會商次數激增，可暗示重要議題正由各方展開討議之中。特魯曼總統昨日近午偕私人秘書羅斯，陸軍顧問華恩及海軍顧問法達　往訪邱士爾首相，略作會談後，即與之共進午餐，飯後又作會談多時，然談話之際，僅爲渠等二人。同時，美國務卿彭斯，亦至英外相艾登之別墅內與之共進午餐，及後特魯曼。邱吉爾又與彼等之國務卿及外長公作會談數分鐘。是日下午，特魯壘總統偕同國務卿彭斯往訪史太林大元帥，舉行會談，按前次三頭會議中已有規定，對於現在會議中之各項商討議題及何種言論，均不准對外透露，故目前甚至關於三國陸海要員會談之事項亦嚴守秘密，然而一般正受餓饉緊迫之柏林居民，現在因祖國已失去自主，不得不引頸深望有無有關彼等將來前途之暗示。</p>
<h3>美英蘇聯各國政策</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　此間朝日新聞之蘇黎世特電，則述三頭會議與美。英。蘇三國之世界政策，其要旨如次：蘇聯對德政策之着眼點，在完全把握德國民衆，樹立確爲復興德國之積極方針，但迄今現今，美。英方面之對德政策，毫無成算，從引起德人之憤激，暴露其對德政策之優柔寡斷而已。史太林議長會與渝行政院長宋子文舉行六次會談，與渝方進行商洽之事實。已將美國迫入新之立塲，由此可證明美國對三國會議之準備，已落人後。蘇聯所抱之現實政策。認爲與淪方協議，較與美國協議更多期待，俾將來可於中國素固其政洽及軍事地位，以對抗每。英，並可蘇以保特兩國親善。美國爲企圖在日本本土登陸作戰，故必須將日軍紊制於滿洲，因此，在東亞方面，亦需要蘇聯之援助，但須適可而止，不容蘇聯超越其限度，此爲美國今日對蘇外交之基礎，亦即其弱點，如是美。英與蘇聯雖政見各有不同，然於此次波次坦會議時，或將提議發表關於東亞之共同聲明等，此由日本之立塲觀之，實爲新國際事態之開展。殊可注目。</p>
<h3>胡世澤在蘇　聯繼續折衝</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　由於英美各報紛粉論述，謂史太林，宋子文之莫斯科會談，爲「中國之雅爾達會談」，或「達東之雅爾達方式」，致交涉兩週未見結果，而發表停止會談，不過欲綏和其緊張之空氣而已。據十六日重慶路透社電，史太林。宋子文會談停止後，外次胡世澤仍留莫斯科，就原則上合意之特定問題繼續折衝。又宋子文返淪後，現預定携帶再交涉之新訓令重赴莫斯科，再開會談。</p>
<h3>英聲明保障　希領土完整</h3>
<p>蘇黎世十九日中央社電　關於希臘國境紛爭問題，現已逐漸深刻化，希臘，阿爾巴尼亞，南斯拉夫，保加利亞各國，各於其國境地區集結重兵，因情勢異常緊張之故，前曾預定於今冬撤退之英軍，或將繼續滯留該地，頃據法國通信社雅典電稱，邱吉爾頃對希臘聲明，保障不使希臘領土主權爲外人侵略，勸其不必擔憂，且裝備優秀之英軍，現業於希臘北部國境一帶配置妥當，準備一切，以保護希臘領土之完整。</p>
<h3>蘇聯復興工作　積極進行中</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據塔斯社莫斯科訊，此間「眞理報」稱，自德國佔領下解放農村地區之大規模復興工作，現在正在進行中。僅以俄羅斯共和國以前被佔領之土地上而言，曾遭德人所破壞者，計集禮農民房舍達一百萬所，農村建築物達八十五萬所，以及醫院七千二百五十所。在斯摩稜斯克州大約有二千個村莊被焚燬，而在莫斯科州則有六百個村莊彼焚燒。在白俄羅斯與島克蘭等地區，所有村莊均羅火災，因此遂有大規模之建築物復興計劃。現雖處於戰時困難之形勢下，然仍能按照計劃著手實施。僅在俄羅斯共和國已經建造或恢復之往房五十六萬三千所，大約有二百二十五萬人由土　與廢墟中遷至此等新屋中。據計政府貨興民衆於德軍佔領期中所被損房屋之建築費達萬萬五千五百萬盧布以上。自從德軍被逐出白俄羅斯以來，不過一載，十三萬七千所之集體農民房舍，已經次第在鄕村中建築完成，其他大規模復興工作，亦正在烏克蘭與波羅的海各共和國積極進行中</p>
<h3>威爾遜　繼任美財長</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電華盛頓來電稱，特魯曼總統十七日發表，任命戰時動員局長威爾遜繼毛根韜之後任財政都長。威爾遜遺缺，另委由彼友人前銀行納家斯達繼任。</p>
<h3>比利時國王　恢復執政權</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　布魯塞爾電泰台廣播稱，比利時上院昨日　決國王奧波恢復執政權一案，同時在兩院通過，上院以七十七票對五十入票之優勢，通過該案、</p>

<h3>今日之松江</h3>
<p>— 志澄</p>
<p>松江古名雲間，縣治別稱茸城，又號婁村，蓋治西有吳王　傷，其地黃浦環　於南，九峯拱列於北。惟民情習於安樂，不喜遠遊，故仕官千里，差足溫飽，即作歸計。</p>
<p>該縣交通，素稱便利，滬杭甬鐵路斜買縣境，縣治及幸莊新橋明星橋石湖　楓涇等皆有車站。公路計有松滬。松泗。松風。滬杭。泗實。浦南及　余等七綫，貫通各地。水道至上海平湖金山諸縣，皆有定期小輪往來。自米糧開禁後，由松江各地，經話交通錢來滬之食糧，不在少數。</p>
<p>城周九里餘，居民甚少，城內斷垣殘壁，觸目管是，無商業市面可言，惟機關林立而已。商市以西門外一帶最爲熱鬧，商店　比，街道戰後拓寬，一改往昔阻塞之患。東嶽廟中多雜貨攤商及菜販，略似上海之城隍廟，蘇州之玄妙觀，而無其整齊，內附郵都地府，塑像敗敗壞，空氣陰沉，相傳建於明萬曆年間。城西南有醉白池，爲顧大申之別墅，今屬育嬰堂，小沼荷香，疏牕竹影，地旣僻靜，景尢淸幽。</p>
<p>取締不法</p>
<p>該縣南濱東海，黃浦江橫貴其間，致浦南各區之環境較爲惡劣，北境多山爲各部隊出沒之區，全縣以第一二四五區較爲安寗，現配備縣保安隊×中隊，會同警局，維持地方秩序，治安已日見良奸。</p>
<p>不久之前，曾有若干不法之徒，常至各商店菜館及旅館，仗勢浪用，不付分文，時或更使用申莊達期鉅額支票，着找現鈔另數，否則拳足交加，或持械相向，故各商店旅館之正當主顧，反退避三舍，每日營業損失，大則百萬以上，少則亦需十餘萬，各店主不堪其　，相率停業，致城外僅有之鬧市，一變而爲慘澹冷靜。常局鑒於事態之嚴重，特會同盟方軍憲及警察局，嚴密取締，將一般不法之徒，予以斷然處置，一面着各商店復業，迨至最近始完全蕭淸。</p>
<p>米亟農產</p>
<p>太縣土地面積共九十六萬七千二百〇二畝，內農田面積六十五萬四千六百七十一畝，水田居多。出產以米棉爲大宗，米年產大十萬石左右，大小麥約二萬石許，棉花約四萬五千担，菜籽一萬餘担，大豆一萬餘担，尚有其他農產品，　量甚　，無　估計</p>
<p>本縣　譽爲產米之鄒，週來感受生活高漲，各項捐現苛雜浩大，致農村經濟頻於破產，購肥力量，亦頗薄弱，更以各區治安不良，故出產量因亦減少，試觀上列數字，與戰前較，竟減少十分之五。自從食米解禁，以農村之存米不充，近雖有販戶不絕於途，惟輯出情形，已趨平淡。</p>
<p>其他物產，如東門外三畝田之紫蘇，荷洋浜之落蘇，皆較他處爲佳。四腮　自昔著名，以產於秀野橋下者爲最佳，民二十五年九月，日第一流文豪後藤博士，曾來松專訪此物，歸國後日著文「松江訪　記」，發表報端。畜收以養鶏養豬爲盛，冬銷往上每。</p>
<p>關於農貸，已於七月三日成立分處，並組織委員會，由縣長曁常地各金融界鉅子分任委員，在委員會下設分署，實接辦理貸款事宜，據稱松江方面之借款總數爲二萬五千萬元，由江蘇省農貨處邊後，並謂貸款係信用担保，由鄕鎭保甲長聯保，每戶至多貸與二十五萬元，爲購置農具及肥料之用。叩諸當地農民，彼等希望手續簡單迅速，以應急需；務求直接，避免轉手人之巾幗，以期增加款項之用　。</p>
<p>靑慈善</p>
<p>江敎育，在戰前尚稱發達，約有二百二十餘所。其後幾經滄桑，衰敗殊甚，以全縣學齡童論，失學者占十分之入以上，近因敎育界領導人員，辦理失當，一切設施非惟因循徇私，甚目囊括學租，尅扣俸米，與論　然。現當局債極整頓，更換敎育局長，將學田九千餘畝，爲改善學校之經費，向各界籌款一千萬元以上，爲補助敎員之用，並擬辦理助學金，造福濟寒學子，</p>
<p>各慈善事業向由慈善　產暫　會負責辦理，育嬰全節資老三堂，現有老人婦一百二十人，婺婦一百戶（平均每戶三人），嬰孩計殘廢及乳嬰五十餘人，合計收容四五百人。又車　前，敎會曾設有松江孤費兒院一所，收容孤貧兒童八十人，最近復收容孤兒三十五名（由滬疏散來松），共計一百十五名，每月食用所　在一千萬元以上，際此百物昂責，斷炊堪憂，甚望各大善士，及松江旅滬熱心紳商，慷慨捐輸，俾孤貧苦兒，無凍綏之處。</p>

<h3>市府昨日會商　救濟突襲災黎　盼市民加緊防速疏散</h3>
<p>本月十七，十八兩日敵機　，盲目轟炸，無辜民眾死傷甚多，被毀房屋亦複不少，市府羅秘書長曾於前日親赴災區視察，代喪周市長對災黎備加慰問。複於昨日（十九日）上午在市府會議室召集市府各局處長以及防空本部員　人員，舉行臨時會議，對敵機來襲後之被害難胞救護救濟等問題，加以縝密並實際之商討。首由防空本部野口總務處長以及本市警察局副局長渡正監。滿其蔚暨袁衛生局局長。劉經濟局長。　教育局長。周社會　利局長等，作詳細報告。　由羅秘書長及胡副秘書長細切指示，勉以各局處仝人在此非常時期，必須力謀行政之簡素化，盡全力救濟被害災民，一切不合理之現象，尤　須迅速調整。例如某幾個醫院對診療因空　而受傷之災民索取巨額診金等，應加嚴歷　。並飭衛生當局立即擬具本市醫院醫務人員醫藥用具等整個高度支配辦法。又關於因救護被災人民而負傷或死亡之撫卹獎勵辦法，亦囑防空本部從速擬訂，以便由市府迅速分佈。其他各被害者家屬之救濟，食糧之　，災民或收容地所之公布，各區臨時救護醫院之公布等，均已決定辦法，即可以實施。尤盼市民加緊防空設備，　速疏散，以避免無謂犧牲。</p>
<p>市民福利協會今天緊急會議</p>
<p>市民福利協會以本市因空襲受災難民，流離失所，痛苦不堪，急待救濟，　定於今（二十）日下行五時，假申報社會議室舉行緊急會議，商討推動救濟工作等一切事宜。茲將該會議全體理事名單錄下：聞　亭．李思浩．趙　卿．袁履登．葉扶菁．許冠羣．許曉初．林康侯．裴雲卿．陳紹　．陳日平．王伯元．朱博泉．孫瑞璜．江上達．金雄白．陳彬　．項康原．顧南羣．總幹事胡　祺。</p>
<p>醫院收容傷者須詢姓名住址</p>
<p>最近敵機兩度　滬，施行盲目轟炸，以致無辜平民，死傷眾多，幸當局對於防空設施完善，救護工作特別努力，遇有輕重傷者，救護送往各醫院治療，亦屬非常迅速。惟於空龔下百忙中從事受傷者救護，俱不及詳詢受傷者姓名，住址及家屬，親屬，故探望領回傷者，亦感困難。市衛生局有鑒於此，　即通知全市各公私立醫院，對於收容空龔時病人，統應詳詢其姓名，住址及家屬，親屬，予以記錄，如不能言語者，可探閱其居住證，亦予記錄，俾在各報披露姓名住址或逕按址通知其家屬或親屬。</p>
<h3>警局令各分局加強防空設施　並促市民開掘自流井</h3>
<p>市警察局因鑒於敵機之一再侵襲滬境，為未雨綢繆起見，令飭各分局加強防空設施，除開　適當之防空境外，並開掘防空用貯水池及防空用井，以防萬一自來水中斷之　。同時促飭民眾加強防空設施，最好第一裏弄亦開掘一自流井，以備應付萬一。</p>
<p>防空訓練更應重視</p>
<p>十七，十八兩日本市遭敵美機濫炸，中日外各國居民無辜傷者，約計一千五百名之眾。惟此次敵機作規模圈套之轟炸後，嗣後必將反覆來龔，此固可逆料者。鑒於被害慘狀，市民對於防空訓練更須加以重視。開關過去當局　經警告之各點，更應注意。盡此次遭災地區之死傷者，大部於空龔警察發令後，並未躲入防空壕，或自窗口仰看天空，或大膽在道上行走所致。反之，在東部地區之某日本國民學校，聞警報後，立即全體入防空壕待避，故雖受頗多直擊彈，而無一人受輕傷者，可見待避一項如何重要。又為防備空龔，平時即行將衣服及糧食等事先疏散，以及在空龔時當待　或　難時，亦應隨身攜帶若幹衣服，足供兩日用之糧食，以及應急救護物品，例如紗布，消毒藥品等。因防空本部關於受災者之救護，雖有萬全之準備，但轟炸地區廣大時，則在時間上難免有不能周密顧到之處，此點更望市民特別注意。</p>
<h3>縣管處長職務　副處長代行</h3>
<p>市縣政管理處處長蔡　，前奉調任財政局副局長，業於本月一日正式到局辦公，所遺處長職務，當因沈新處長尚未接事，　仍負責處理。茲蔡氏以財政局科事務繁忙，所有處務不克兼顧，已簽奉市長批准，在新任未輕接事以前，所有縣政管理處長職務，依法暫由副處長胡宗王行使。</p>
<h3>房地產買賣　徵收所得稅</h3>
<p>上海區所得稅徵收局，近奉財政部所得稅處頒發徵收第一類丙項所得稅暫行辦法一則，聞該局現已遵照是項辦法第三條之規定，凡以投機營利之方法，為房地產之買賣者，均按一時營利事業，照章課稅。但經政府註冊之房地產公司，歷年繳納一類甲項所得稅者，仍俟年度結帳後，按例課稅，免納一時營利所得稅。該局已分兩本市財政地政兩局，及有關機關分別協助，嗣後未經註冊之公司行號，或以其他名義從事於房地產買賣，以營利為目的者，概應於成交之前，向該局申報，達經查覺或被舉發，定予依法嚴懲決不寬貸。</p>
<h3>房屋轉租執照　定期發申請書</h3>
<p>本市舊一八區本年下半年度二房東轉租執照，茲經市財政局規定於本月二十五日起開始發給申請書，以便填報換領新照。</p>
<h3>交經紀人　申報營業稅</h3>
<p>華商證券交易所經　人公會頃通告各會員，關於同業報繳營業稅，業與當局商定辦法，所有春季營業稅按照三十三年度十．十一．十二三個月營業佣金收入，按千分之十五報稅，另加過期罰金二成。凡營業佣金收入在百萬元者，應繳營業稅一萬八千元。又夏季營業稅按照本年一月份營業佣金收入三個月，按千分之十五報稅，但無過期罰金，自即日起已開始辦理申報。</p>
<p>讀者　助學消息</p>
<h3>希望富家子女　羣起搶救失學</h3>
<p>陳秀琴女士首先響應</p>
<p>助學運動，貴在實踐力行，我能獨立捐助，固屬至善，即使無經濟能力，亦當集合親友，共同捐助，轉輾介紹，互相推動，則三萬萬元目標，不旋踵而計日可成，可　也，昨承至德堂認捐榮譽隊，　氏以堂名出之。不願公佈其真名，足見為善之真誠。又承彭熙君與無名氏各捐五十萬元，正大廠及許金桂君各認一隊，均於大雨傾盆之下，專程送來，彌足感　！榮儀記採取「集體分認法」，獨捐十萬，並　華記·范制記·各五萬元，集成二十萬元為一隊，熱心助學，同人不勝欣幸。所望社會熱心諸公，紛紛響應，使本屆助金，早日完成目標，功德無亮！明德女中學生陳秀琴女士，自動向父親要求捐助一隊，附信勸告定有之家之子女，都能照此推動，共起搶救失學兒童，妙齡女子，具此作育英材之善心，而其令尊居然一諾萬金，所謂有賢父，必有賢女，家庭教育之完善，可想見矣。</p>
<p>壽辰賀儀　悉充義舉</p>
<p>彭熙君函雲：昨為歸人賤辰，　荷諸親友好寵錫　儀，心感無已。除已捐助新聞報貨學金五十萬元，小本貸金·館　助金·醫藥貸金各十萬元，複修湖南會館捐款一百萬元，上海中山義務學校·光　學校·上海　學校·幽默畫社各五萬元外，特再送呈支票一紙，計五十萬元，舉捐貴報助學金，藉為親友造　。</p>
<p>見人失學　於心不安</p>
<p>明德女中初一學生陳秀琴函雲：我是高小畢業生，現將升入初中，在這　物飛漲，生活指數日　的情境中，尚能安心求學，真可謂是幸運者。反願有許多小朋友，因家境清寒，他們的父母不能負擔他們的學費，只有失學，是多麼的不幸與可憐呢？在這不幸的小朋友中有許多很聰明，很努力的，我們怎能眼看著他們因為無錢付學費而半途停學呢？我雖可安心求學，但我不忍眼看許多小朋友遭受失學。故向父母訴說我的意思，並要求給我錢十五萬元捐入申報助學金。父親聽了大為贊成，立刻給我十五萬元的支票一紙，但是十五萬元有什麼用呢？這小數目是無補於事的，雖然的　親是非常贊成我的意思，但我家並非富有之家，所以不能多數捐助，是很慚愧。希望許多富家子女，都能響應，則積少成多，或能幫助幾許失學的小朋友呢。</p>

<h3>萬元以上捐稅　得付即期票</h3>
<p>市財政局為便利市民繳納各項捐稅起見。自即日起捐稅數額不滿一萬元者應以現鈔支付，數額在一萬元以上者，得以通用即期票據繳納，經征機關不得強迫繳納現鈔。已令所屬一體週知。</p>
<h3>票據隔日交換　大致已決定</h3>
<p>本市銀錢錢兩　，以邇來同業票據張數頻增，交換手續益感困難，以致每日交換差額及退票張數，亦隨之增多。客戶與客戶及收付款行荘彼此糾紛，亦因之而迭起，為解決困難，適應需要起見，　經銀錢業聯席會議商討隔日交換票據之事，結果原則完全通過，細則問題則議決由銀行錢荘兩業公會分別擬具，再交銀錢業聯席會議商討採擇，定期一致實行。現據向金融界方面探悉，銀錢業隔日交換票據事宜，兩公會並均原則通過，勢在必行，且已由兩公會分交小組及實務委員會慎重商討施行細則條文，銀行業細則已通過，錢荘業日內小組會議再予商討。正式實行日期，至遲約在本月底左右，但票據法內原有票據須當日交換之規定，今以該兩業事實困難關係，準備辦理票據隔日交換為全於情理行前，備文財政部當局，請求備案，以求法律上之根據。</p>
<h3>五期金證券　日內繼續發行　將依合理標準訂定價格</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行金證券發行以來，黃金　市逐趨穩定，自第五期金證券延期後，因投機市　詞蠢動，且受無稽流言之煽惑，吸收黃金者益見旺盛，市價瘋狂暴漲，影響社會民生治安甚钜。茲悉該行為壓制黃金暴漲，予投機市儈迎頭痛擊計，現擬於日內　發行第五期金理論上券，聞掛牌價格，決依合理標準訂定之。</p>
<p>金證券市況</p>
<p>金證券市場昨日漲風臉熾，均突破七百萬大關而告漲停板，惟以求過於供，交易不旺。茲　價格如左：</p>
<p>到期券，最高七○八萬元，最低六一五萬元，停板七○八萬元，漲九三萬元。</p>
<p>四期券最高七一三萬元，最低六二○萬元，停板七一三萬元，漲九三萬元。</p>

<h3>改跳舞廳為災民醫院</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>本月七七十八兩日本市被炸，市民的生命財產，不知受到多少損害，那種斷頭拼足的慘狀，誠不忍卒　。處在如此嚴重的環境下，誰也保不　明天的事，隨時隨地有被慘酷犧牲的可能。按諸人類同船共濟的天職任，誰也不容躲避，應該人人盡其力之可能，救災救難。鑒於市民受重傷後，救治醫院的缺乏，我建議借用市區的許多跳舞廳，作為臨時病院，記得當年八一三戰事初發，租界上許多跳舞廳，都改設臨時難民收容所和傷兵醫院，將奢糜享樂的場所，一改而為表現人類互相互濟精神的所在，今日的情狀嚴重不下於昔日，切望當局和社會熱心人士，一加考慮，則災民幸甚。</p>
<h3>請市府速設難民救濟委員會</h3>
<p>— 桓</p>
<p>敵機連日大舉龔滬，濫肆轟炸，本市東北區一帶受災慘重，民房坍毀甚多，死傷平民約在千余名以上，關於災民之緊急救濟辦法，聞已有社會熱心人士發起組織臨時難民救濟會，辦理救濟工作。</p>
<p>但是，敵機以後恐還要頻頻來空龔的罷！本市的任何一角都愛到轟炸的可能，我們對於防空設備及救護工作，現在固應準備，而關於被災後的救濟問題，同時也不容忽略，鄙見以為市政常局應立即組織全市難民救濟委員會，聯合本市社會熱心人士共同協力，預籌救濟整個具體辦法，除由政府撥支經常費用外，同時更可向各界人士積極募捐，以備臨時救濟之用，關於該委員會之當前工作可分下述各點：</p>
<p>㈠籌措經費及基金：該會經常辦公費用，似可由市府指　一定數額，以作補助，至其救濟費用相當浩大，且應早有充分準備，以免臨渴掘井，會卒無措，倘能籌到巨額基金，應由市政當局會同社會公正人士組織保管委員會保管之。</p>
<p>㈡關於災區善後問題：被炸災區，斷　殘壁，屍體縱橫，事後　應加以處理，尤其當此夏令，於公共衛生更有妨害之處，故屍骸之集中停放及掩埋，瓦　道路之清除，坍毀房屋之修理等工作，實屬爭不容緩。</p>
<p>㈢關於難民救濟問題：被災難民，大都家破人亡，財產盡毀，一般孤兒寡婦，失所流離無家可歸者，厥狀尤慘，為謀臨時救濟計，　應事先歸論若幹難民收容所，以備一有事變發生，即可將災民集中收空，解決其住居問題，同時更應解決其食的問題，如供給粥食或面包，使免饑餓之苦，然後統盤　其善後辦法，分別情形，勒令疏散至原籍或其他指定地點，或轉送慈善機關收養，務使無辜災黎獲得適當歸宿之所，不至走投無路，告苦無門。</p>
<p>上述數點，僅就救濟工作舉其　大者而言，至難民救濟委員會之組織及整個辦法，有待市政當局之採納，及縝密商討，更盼社會熱心公益人士多方協力，及早促成這。</p>

<h3>Air Raids on Yokosuka and the Kanto Area; Japanese Air Force Launches Interception, Shooting Down and Destroying Over 100 Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Yokosuka Naval District Headquarters announced on the 19th that during the enemy carrier-based aircraft's two attacks on Yokosuka Naval Port on the 18th, the Japanese side's achieved victories, as of 6:00 AM on the 19th, included 40 aircraft shot down and 38 destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The total number of enemy carrier-based aircraft attacking various areas in the Kanto region and Yokosuka Naval Port since the 18th has reached 900. The Japanese Army and Navy's total battle results include 75 shot down and 46 destroyed, totaling 121 aircraft. The Japanese side suffered almost no damage on the ground.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - For unknown reasons, the enemy's mobile force did not attack the Japanese mainland with carrier-based aircraft today, perhaps retreating beyond the range of the Japanese Air Force. On the 18th, the Japanese aviation units launched daring interception battles against the attacking enemy carrier-based aircraft everywhere, achieving significant results. It is now confirmed that 80 aircraft were shot down and 53 destroyed. Furthermore, approximately 30 attacking enemy aircraft were shot down in one location. At approximately 12:00 AM on the same day, a few small enemy naval vessels shelled fishing villages near Shirahama at the southern tip of the Boso Peninsula for about ten minutes. After firing on civilian homes, they fled. The Japanese side suffered minimal damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Approximately 60 enemy P-51 aircraft intruded into the Kinki region around 5:00 AM on the 19th for about an hour, mainly attacking airfields and transportation facilities, etc. The Japanese side suffered little damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - 60 enemy P-51 aircraft attacked various airfields in western Gifu, Aichi, and the Shizuoka region at 9:00 AM on the 19th for one hour. Damage to the Japanese side was minimal, and interception results are currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Approximately 80 enemy P-51 and P-51 military aircraft, and 3 B-24 aircraft from Okinawa base, intruded into southern Kyushu around 9:00 AM on the 18th. The main force of 60 aircraft operated in Miyazaki, and a portion of 20 aircraft operated in Kagoshima and Kumamoto. Furthermore, 9 B-29 aircraft from the Marianas base dropped sea mines in the Kanmon Strait and its surrounding areas at 12:30 AM on the 18th.</p>
<p>Sapporo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese military's interception of enemy carrier-based aircraft attacking Hokkaido on the 14th and 15th resulted in major victories. Subsequent investigations have revealed that the results were even greater, with a total of 32 aircraft shot down and 21 destroyed.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force, General Okamura, Issues Statement: Troop Withdrawal Should Be Based on Armistice; Maximum Assistance Will Be Provided for Food Problem</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - According to the Continental New Daily, General Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force stationed in China, hosted the capital's propaganda and reporting authorities at the Nanjing Keiko Company at 3:00 PM on the 9th of this month, providing detailed accounts of the current general war situation and revealing the Expeditionary Force's determination to fight. The key points of the General's statement on that day are supplemented below:</p>
<p>Recently, some people in China's opinion circles have been advocating for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. However, there are two points to consider regarding the so-called troop withdrawal. First, the withdrawal should be based on an armistice; otherwise, it will not achieve its goal but will instead lead to chaos. The current war is not between Japan and China, but a war with Chongqing backed by the United States. Given this situation, withdrawal is naturally not permissible. Second, even if Japan were to leave the above issues aside and begin withdrawing troops, it would not be completed in a short period. The armed withdrawal of Japanese soldiers will take approximately two years, and the duration will have to be extended due to the disruption of transportation by the U.S. Air Force. Therefore, hastily withdrawing troops without considering the above tactics is unacceptable to us.</p>
<p>Regarding the enemy's amphibious operations, I hold two contradictory emotions. On the one hand, as a neighbor of China, I cannot help but feel saddened for the Chinese people by the devastation of Chinese territory. On the other hand, to rapidly defeat America's Pacific strategy, I hope for an American landing and welcome the early arrival of American troops. I have the determination and confidence to achieve final victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Yan'an's current practices certainly need to change. However, I believe that Yan'an is not an absolutely incompatible regime with China. The relationship is a domestic issue, and I do not wish to comment on it at length. However, Chongqing's reliance on other countries to resolve domestic problems is not appropriate.</p>
<p>The food problem lies in the incompleteness of the purchasing methods and the lack of smoothness in transportation. Improving this situation is naturally the responsibility of the Chinese government, but the Japanese side also has a responsibility. The Expeditionary Force will continue to provide as much assistance as possible, and the future of China's food supply should be reassuring.</p>
<h3>Next Operational Intentions of the U.S. Military</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The enemy U.S. military, which has seized control of the Okinawa battle situation, is actively preparing naval and air bases on the island, coordinating with the Mariana Islands base and the Iwo Jima base. For the past ten days, they have been using B-29, B-24, and P-51 fighters as the core of a combined battle-bomber air force to conduct tactical and strategic bombing of military production facilities and small to medium-sized cities across the Japanese mainland. Meanwhile, they are attempting to re-equip their mobile force, which has lost half its strength in the Okinawa campaign. Since the 10th, they have been encroaching on the waters near the mainland, attacking the Kanto region on the 14th and the northeastern and southern Hokkaido regions on the 14th and 15th, and parts of the Kanto and northeastern regions again on the 17th. At the same time, some of their warships have conducted the first-ever shelling of Kamaishi and Muroran on the mainland. However, it would be naive to assume that these actions mean the U.S. military intends to launch a landing operation on the mainland. The enemy's mobile force is cruising near the mainland and strafing Japanese airfields and other military facilities, as well as ports and ships with machine gun fire. This is clearly the preliminary aerial battle before a landing on the mainland. One of the enemy's objectives is to scout out the mainland's air strength and to disperse and deplete Japan's air power. The enemy's mobile force is also supplementing the strategic and tactical bombing from the Iwo Jima base, which has not been entirely successful, by attacking specific areas and destroying important Japanese production facilities in order to reduce production and sow fear to achieve a psychological effect. The Japanese side has long been preparing and reinforcing its defenses to obstruct the enemy's advance, and the damage caused by carrier-based aircraft has been extremely minimal. The enemy's attacks have been a complete failure, causing them anxiety. Based on the recent movements of the enemy's mobile force, there is a hint of a new landing operation. However, the intention of this intrusion by the enemy's mobile force is still difficult to determine the next strategy and intention. If the enemy's next strategy aims to land on the mainland, the existing enemy air bases in the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa are too far away. To expand and strengthen these air bases, they would need to secure an air base closer to the mainland before launching a landing. Furthermore, while preparing the Okinawa base, the enemy has been conducting air raids on the mainland from that area and bases in the Philippines, which have become increasingly active recently. It is easy to fully deduce that the enemy has strategic and political landing intentions in that direction. However, the Japanese army on the mainland has already completed thorough preparations, concentrating its forces to launch a head-on attack on the enemy, and the enemy's landing attempt will certainly fail.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Ministry Announces Special Attack Force Achievements: 236 Honored Warriors</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to an announcement by the Japanese Navy Ministry on the 18th, the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet recently issued a notice to the entire army regarding the great achievements of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force members in destroying enemy mobile forces and ship convoys around Okinawa Island. A total of 236 warriors have been honored, including members of the Shinryu unit, who are launched from mother ships in rocket-powered small aircraft, vowing to sink enemy ships at all costs. This is the second time the spirit of the Shinryu unit's special attacks has been proclaimed to the entire army to show the world. In total, they have sunk or destroyed over 600 enemy ships, achieving unprecedented victories in history, bringing brilliant results to the Okinawa operation. The heavy damage suffered by the enemy is all due to the merits of these special attack warriors.</p>
<h3>Three-Power Conference: Hidden Reefs Ahead; Military Commentator Discusses World Political Situation</h3>
<p>A military commentator in this city recently provided a detailed commentary on the current world political situation as follows:</p>
<h3>Three-Power Conference: Peace as Prerequisite</h3>
<p>Regarding the Anglo-American-Soviet three-power conference, there seems to be a hidden reef due to Stalin's tardiness. According to reports from the British and American sides, this three-power conference is like an East Asian version of the Yalta Conference, or rather, a prerequisite for future peace. It is understood that a peace conference will be held early next year, and this three-power conference is a preparatory meeting. The progress of this conference has not been disclosed so far. The schedule originally called for a meeting on the 16th, but it was postponed by one day due to Stalin's late arrival. On the morning of the 16th, U.S. President Truman consulted with Secretary of State Byrnes and his staff after getting up, and then visited British Prime Minister Churchill. Although Stalin's movements were secret, it is believed that he arrived in Potsdam on the afternoon of the 16th. According to another report, Truman and Churchill held an informal meeting in Potsdam on that day, and the staff of the British and American sides also exchanged opinions. It is also said that Stalin and Truman conducted their first meeting on the 17th, where they discussed important world issues, and that they had also arranged to meet Churchill. According to an incoming telegram on the 18th, Truman first had lunch with Churchill, and in the afternoon Truman visited Stalin for a second meeting. Reporters are not allowed to participate in this conference, and the release of news is prohibited. Lieutenant Colonel John, a military outreach officer with the U.S. Department of the Army, said in a report that the conference proceeded according to past procedures. Before the conference, Song Ziwen visited Stalin in Moscow, acting as a mediator. The fact that Stalin arrived a day late on the scheduled date further confirms that there are hidden reefs in the future of the three-power conference.</p>
<h3>Enemy U.S. Movements in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Regarding the future movements of the U.S. military in the Pacific, according to the New York Times on the 17th, the decision of where the British and American forces will land will be made according to the overall situation, but it pointed out that a landing on the Chinese mainland is more likely in the next operation, while actively bombing the Japanese mainland. As for Japan's war power and air power, according to what the enemy has released, Japan's underground factory production is progressing considerably, and stockpiles are very abundant. Moreover, based on Japan's glorious past achievements and the rising spirit of special attacks, with the ability to kill a hundred with one blow, the world is astonished. With such strong strength, it is not willing to act rashly. Therefore, some people say that once the enemy begins to invade and land on the Japanese mainland, Japan will mobilize all manpower and aircraft to launch a head-on attack on the enemy. At that time, the damage suffered by the enemy will be several times greater than the tragic Okinawa Island campaign. This is not difficult to imagine. Japan is striving to liberate the nations of East Asia and build a new world of universal brotherhood in East Asia. In order to eliminate the influence of Britain and the United States in Japan and China, and permanently expel them from East Asia, both China and Japan, as well as all the nations of East Asia, must permanently maintain their faith and advance towards the construction of a new East Asia under the same goal.</p>
<h3>Indo-British Conference Negotiations Break Down</h3>
<p>Regarding the breakdown of the Simla Conference in India, the process has been explained to the House of Commons by Amery, the British Secretary of State for India. The conference began on June 25th and discussed the following: The positions of Army Minister and other important posts in the Governor-General's Executive Council should be filled by Indians, and the Commander-in-Chief must also be borne by an Indian. Implementing the Indian proposal for a large-scale reform in the Executive Council. Appointing new Indian diplomats to be sent overseas. Cripps had previously called on India to discuss the possibility of independence after the war, but so far there has been no progress. The purpose of this new proposal is to facilitate India's self-governance and grant it independence. The formal meeting began on that day of the week and adjourned on July 14th. When Indian Governor Wavell initially advocated for the election of members of the Executive Council, he requested that the Conference nominate Muslim League members as candidates and request a list of names. However, until the day of the adjournment, Wavell only explained the progress of the conference. In addition, Jinnah, Chairman of the Muslim League, did not guarantee the selection of Muslim League members, leading to suspicion and stagnation. The final conclusion was that Wavell perfunctorily considered and decided to maintain civil order, so a new plan was not easily produced. In short, Britain has been consistently implementing a colonial policy toward India, sacrificing the Indians to extract their benefits. In the past, during the First World War, it had promised India independence, but has still not fulfilled that promise. Judging by past precedents, Britain will never grant India true independence.</p>
<h3>Battle of Tana Island: Japanese Forces Inflict Losses</h3>
<p>Tana Island Front Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese forces sweeping up remaining enemy troops on Tana Island have reduced their forces by 200, and have generally completed the island's mopping-up operation.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese troops sweeping up enemy troops who landed on Tana Island have gradually suppressed the enemy towards the west coast since receiving reinforcements on the 11th. Since the 12th, they have killed or wounded approximately 200 enemy soldiers, and 500 enemy soldiers since the enemy landed.</p>
<h3>Jurisdiction of Japanese Ministry of Munitions Transferred to Local Authorities</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Ministry of Munitions has decided to transfer legal jurisdiction to local authorities, which will be announced on the 20th and implemented immediately. The target of the transfer is laws applicable to various military common uses, such as the Air Defense Law, the Enterprise Consolidation Order, the Metal Recovery Law, the Military Supply Company Law, the Factory and Workplace Management Material Control Order, the National Emergency Mobilization Order, the Important Workplace Labor Management Order, the Wage Control Order, and the Factory Law Wartime Special Order. The Ministry will transfer most of its authority to local officials. Local military supply management officials, local mining bureau chiefs, local fuel bureau chiefs, and metropolitan and prefectural governors will implement military supply production administration on the spot to increase efficiency in handling affairs.</p>
<h3>Suzhou-Shanghai Highway Actively Repaired</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the Provincial Construction General Engineering Office began repairing the Suzhou-Shanghai Highway, progress has been extremely tense. Although the weather is very hot, the general situation of the construction work has been quite good in recent days. The Construction Office has repeatedly dispatched supervisors to inspect the work in the heat to ensure that the repair of the road surface and bridge markers is in accordance with the original plan. There are still several weeks until the completion date.</p>

<h3>The Berlin Three-Power Conference</h3>
<p>The three-power conference of Truman, Churchill, and Stalin began at 5:00 PM on July 17th in the Sanssouci Palace in the ancient city of Potsdam, 32 kilometers southwest of Berlin. This conference is being held in a new environment where the European war has ended and the most important European issues, such as the Polish issue, have been resolved. Therefore, the content of the conference is clearly very different from the previous two three-power conferences, and it deserves the attention of those of us in the East.</p>
<p>The Tehran Three-Power Conference in the winter of 1943 was an international high-level strategic meeting that emphasized military matters first. The result was the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944, opening the Second Front. The Second Three-Power Conference in Yalta in February 1945 was an international high-level meeting that combined military and political considerations. As a result, in military terms, there was the tragedy of Germany's unconditional surrender on May 8th of this year, and in political terms, there was the San Francisco Conference from April 25th to June 26th of this year, which adopted the United Nations Charter. The first conference focused on European issues, while the second conference gradually expanded to issues outside of Europe.</p>
<p>However, the nature of the current third conference is very different from the previous two. The main differences are: first, the military significance of this conference has been reduced to a secondary position; second, the issue of international politics has been elevated to the top priority; third, East Asian issues have begun to become a very prominent topic in this conference.</p>
<p>Summarizing the information obtained from various sources so far, it can be seen that the main topics of this Berlin Three-Power Conference are: The German settlement plan, because the plan for Germany decided at the Crimea Yalta Conference is no longer suitable for the current situation. The specific methods of governing Germany, the period of stationing troops and joint management, and the issue of Germany's freedom and independence after the expiration will all be decided on a common fundamental policy at this conference. The problem of building a new order in Europe, including settlement plans for Germany, Italy, Hungary, Austria, Norway, Finland, and other countries. The problems of the Mediterranean and Balkan countries, especially the conflict between Britain, America, and Southern Italy centered on the Port of Trieste, the conflict between Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania, and Britain and the Soviet Union centered on the Greek-Macedonian border issue, and the conflict between Britain, France, and even the United States and the Soviet Union centered on the Tangier autonomous region. The problems of the Near East and the Middle East, such as the Anglo-French conflict centered on the Syrian issue, the Anglo-American-French-Soviet conflict centered on the Palestinian issue and the Jewish-Arab issue, the Anglo-American-Soviet conflict centered on oil issues in Iran and Iraq, and even the problems of all the Arab countries. The Far East problem, that is, the confrontation between Britain, the United States, Chongqing, and the Soviet Union centered on the Sino-Japanese problem.</p>
<p>Among these many issues, what we are most concerned about is naturally the last one, the issue of East Asia. The British, American, and Chongqing sides have dreamed of a sudden change in the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union for many years, and they all hope to achieve this at this three-power conference. Song Ziwen's activities in San Francisco and Washington before the conference, as well as his return to Chongqing and then his trip to Moscow for the conference, show not only Chongqing's attitude, but also the anxiety of Britain and the United States about the East Asian problem. Because the persistence of the East Asian war is the most ruthless mockery of their so-called world peace and security mechanism!</p>
<p>So, does this problem, superficially speaking, just depend on a few words from Stalin? In fact, it is not entirely so! Stalin is a realist. In this matter, Stalin can calmly choose the conditions most favorable to the Soviet Union and the world. And the fact is also very obvious, that the conditions that meet his requirements are definitely not to drive the Red Army, which has been fighting for a long time and is exhausted, to fight again, but rather to sit back and lose all kinds of favorable opportunities. Therefore, without saying anything else, just guessing from the East Asian issue, Truman and Churchill's tricks to incite a new war will definitely fail in this three-power conference.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Unfolds on Both Sides of the Balikpapan-Samarinda Highway; Japanese Garrison Executes Daring Night Raid</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese and U.S. forces are currently engaged in a fierce battle on both sides of the Balikpapan-Samarinda Highway. The battle situation in that area is extremely intense. On the 15th, the enemy used heavy artillery fire and air force bombing as cover to burn down dense forest areas and attack. The Japanese garrison launched a daring night raid that day, killing or wounding 150 enemy soldiers and repelling the enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Although it has been two weeks since the U.S. and Australian forces landed in Balikpapan, they have still been unable to capture the Japanese army positions guarding the hills behind the city. The enemy has attacked several times, but all have been met with strong counterattacks by the Japanese army, only increasing their casualties. The enemy on the Samarinda Highway has only advanced eight kilometers, but has also suffered significant blows due to Japanese counterattacks. The hilly area has been reduced to plains due to the enemy's intense bombing by naval guns and other artillery. However, the morale of all officers and soldiers below the Japanese commander is very high, and they have completely stopped the enemy's advance. On the contrary, the enemy's fighting spirit has been quite frustrated due to the high number of casualties, and they have stopped attacking and are exclusively engaged in collecting the dead and wounded.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The battle situation in Balikpapan is still extremely fierce. On July 1st, the enemy dropped airborne troops from the air under the cover of intense artillery fire and bombing. At this time, a certain Indian Volunteer Corps leader led his troops to break into the enemy's ranks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, and he himself died heroically in the bombing.</p>
<h3>Church Schools All Bombed</h3>
<p>South Front Base, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The enemy's propaganda warfare, alongside their military operations, is actively deployed. Their propaganda targeting the Southern cities of the East Indies is becoming increasingly apparent. For instance, on the 11th of this month, the enemy's frontline broadcast, drawing a parallel from the Balikpapan front, used naval bombardments and bombings during enemy landings as its subject matter. They played their usual low trick of fabricating broadcasts, hoping to incite anti-Japanese sentiment among the East Indians. Moreover, recent instances of enemy atrocities in the East Indies are too numerous to list. For example, on June 29th, when enemy aircraft bombed the city streets of Balikpapan, they targeted churches and schools, harming innocent children. On June 16th, the strafing of Pagelaran destroyed the central mosque. On July 12th, the indiscriminate bombing of an East Indian hospital in Surabaya occurred, and on the 11th, public schools in the same area were strafed. Furthermore, they also shot and killed farmers engaged in increasing food production. In Celebes, Borneo, and along the coast of Java, they indiscriminately bombed and strafed sailing ships. All these atrocities have pained the East Indians, who deeply resent their contempt for East Asians and do not believe the enemy's clever words.</p>
<h3>Oshima Island Air Raid</h3>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Approximately 150 enemy fighter aircraft attacked Oshima Island from the morning of the 18th until 3 PM. The Japanese forces intercepted them, shooting down one plane. Japanese damage was slight.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Urges Localities to Form Rice Industry Associations</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Considering that the new rice crop is about to come to market, the Ministry of Industry believes that the work of local rice industry trade associations needs to be actively developed. However, many counties and cities have not yet completed the reorganization of local rice industry trade associations since they were changed from a district-based system to a county/city-based system in April of this year. The Ministry has instructed the provincial governments to direct their subordinates to quickly establish rice industry trade associations at the county and city level before July 21st.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Burma Shift to Offensive, Crossing the Kisapanadi River in Pursuit</h3>
<p>Burma Front Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese forces, having crossed the Kisapanadi River and shifted to the offensive, broke through the enemy's strongholds during the advance. Without pausing for rest, they forced the enemy to retreat, inflicting great damage. They are now actively expanding their gains. The Japanese forces completely captured the enemy positions at Zongjiaxiu and Meiqiu on the 19th of the lunar calendar. After securing strongholds in these two locations, they launched fierce bayonet attacks and rapidly pursued the defeated enemy with numerous bayonet squads, continuously expanding their gains. Since the start of the Kisapanadi River crossing operation until today, the confirmed results are as follows: over 1,000 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, two aircraft shot down, and a large number of military supplies captured (not including the results from the Meiqiu battle).</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Actively Mobilizes Labor</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – In order to establish a wartime system and mobilize the people of various counties, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has established a Labor Section. Under the leadership of the acting Provincial Governor, they have actively mobilized labor for construction projects for several months, achieving excellent results. Labor Sections have also been uniformly established in the county governments. The provincial government is now actively planning to strengthen labor organization and manage labor groups, enabling them to engage in the construction of roads and air defense facilities. This will absorb some of the surplus labor in society and reduce unemployment, truly a policy that achieves two goals with one action.</p>
<h3>Ministry of People's Training Convenes Work Conference</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Civil Corps Training Department of the Central Party Headquarters, in order to discuss promoting civil training work, has scheduled a Civil Training Work Conference for 10:00 AM on the 20th in the department's auditorium. Standing committee members and heads of civil training departments dispatched by the party headquarters of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Huai provinces, as well as Nanjing and Shanghai, will bring their proposals and work reports to Nanjing on the 19th to register. Minister Mei, along with Vice Ministers Wang and Liu, will personally preside over the meeting, and senior officials from the department will also attend and participate in the discussion.</p>
<h3>Potsdam Conference Discusses Various Key Points</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Reuters special correspondent, the Three-Headed Conference in Potsdam officially began discussing various key topics yesterday evening. The increased frequency of consultations among the chiefs of staff and foreign ministers of the three countries suggests that important issues are being actively discussed by all parties. President Truman visited Prime Minister Churchill near noon yesterday, accompanied by his personal secretary Ross, army advisor Vaughn, and naval advisor Farda. After a brief meeting, they had lunch together and then continued to meet for a long time, although the conversation was limited to the two of them. At the same time, US Secretary of State Byrnes also had lunch with British Foreign Secretary Eden at his villa. Afterwards, Truman and Churchill had a brief meeting with their secretaries of state and foreign ministers. In the afternoon, President Truman, accompanied by Secretary of State Byrnes, visited Marshal Stalin for a meeting. According to previous regulations established during the last Three-Headed Conference, no information regarding the issues discussed or any statements made during the current conference is allowed to be disclosed to the outside world. Therefore, even information about the meetings among the military leaders of the three countries is being kept strictly confidential. However, the residents of Berlin, who are suffering from severe famine, are now forced to anxiously hope for some indication regarding their future prospects, as their homeland has lost its autonomy.</p>
<h3>Policies of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A Zurich dispatch from the Asahi Shimbun of this area described the Three-Headed Conference and the world policies of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, with the main points as follows: The Soviet Union's focus in its policy towards Germany is to completely grasp the German people and establish a positive policy for the reconstruction of Germany. However, to date, the US and British policies towards Germany have no clear plan, only causing resentment among the Germans and exposing their indecisiveness towards Germany. Chairman Stalin has held six meetings with President Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan of Chongqing to negotiate with the Chongqing side. This has forced the United States into a new position, proving that the United States' preparations for the Three-Headed Conference have fallen behind. The Soviet Union's realistic policy is to believe that cooperation with Chongqing is more promising than cooperation with the United States, so that it can consolidate its political and military position in China in the future to counter the United States and Britain, and to ensure friendship between the Soviet Union and Chongqing. In order to attempt a landing operation on the Japanese mainland, the United States must control the Japanese army in Manchuria. Therefore, in East Asia, it also needs the Soviet Union's assistance, but only to a certain extent, and it will not allow the Soviet Union to exceed its limits. This is the foundation of the United States' current diplomacy towards the Soviet Union and also its weakness. Although the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have different political views, they may propose to issue a joint statement on East Asia at this Potsdam Conference. From Japan's standpoint, this is the beginning of a new international situation, which is noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Hu Shize Continues Negotiations in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Due to the widespread discussion in British and American newspapers that the Moscow talks between Stalin and Song Ziwen were "China's Yalta Conference" or "a Yalta-style for the Far East," the negotiations did not yield results after two weeks, and the announcement of the cessation of talks was merely to ease the tense atmosphere. According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 16th, after the Stalin-Song Ziwen talks ceased, Vice Minister Hu Shize remained in Moscow to continue negotiations on specific issues agreed upon in principle. Furthermore, after Song Ziwen returns to Chongqing, he is scheduled to carry new instructions for further negotiations and return to Moscow to resume talks.</p>
<h3>Britain Declares Protection of Greek Territorial Integrity</h3>
<p>Zurich, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The dispute over the Greek border is gradually intensifying. Greece, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria have all gathered heavy troops in their border regions, causing an unusually tense situation. Due to this, British forces, previously scheduled to withdraw this winter, may remain in the area. According to a French news agency dispatch from Athens, Churchill recently declared to Greece that he would guarantee that Greek territorial sovereignty would not be invaded by foreigners, advising them not to worry. Well-equipped British forces have already been deployed along the northern border of Greece, preparing everything to protect the integrity of Greek territory.</p>
<h3>Reconstruction Work in the Soviet Union Actively Underway</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report – According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow, the "Pravda" newspaper here stated that large-scale reconstruction work in the rural areas liberated from German occupation is now underway. In the previously occupied territories of the Russian Republic alone, the Germans destroyed one million collective farmers' houses, 850,000 rural buildings, and 7,250 hospitals. In the Smolensk region, approximately 2,000 villages were burned, and in the Moscow region, 600 villages were burned. In Belarus and Ukraine, all villages were destroyed by fire, hence the large-scale building reconstruction plan. Despite the difficult situation during wartime, it is still being implemented according to plan. In the Russian Republic alone, 563,000 houses have been built or restored, and approximately 2,250,000 people have moved from earth and ruins into these new houses. It is estimated that the government has spent over 155 million rubles on the construction costs of houses destroyed by the Germans during the occupation. In the year since the Germans were driven out of Belarus, 137,000 collective farmers' houses have been successively completed in the countryside, and other large-scale reconstruction work is also actively underway in Ukraine and the Baltic republics.</p>
<h3>Wilson Succeeds as US Treasury Secretary</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A dispatch from Washington states that President Truman announced on the 17th that he appointed Wilson, the Director of the Office of War Mobilization, to succeed Morgenthau as Secretary of the Treasury. Wilson's vacancy will be filled by his friend, former banker Nasda.</p>
<h3>King of Belgium Resumes Power</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A broadcast from Brussels stated that the Belgian Senate yesterday passed a resolution to restore King Leopold's power. The resolution also passed in both houses, with the Senate passing it by a vote of 77 to 50.</p>
<p>Travel Notes</p>
<h3>Songjiang Today</h3>
<p>— Zhi Cheng</p>
<p>Songjiang, formerly known as Yunjian, has the county seat also called Rongcheng, and is also known as Lou Village. To the west of the seat is Wu Wang , with the Huangpu River encircling it to the south, and the Nine Peaks arranged to the north. The people are accustomed to ease and comfort, and dislike traveling far. Therefore, officials who go thousands of miles, if only to be warm and fed, immediately plan to return home.</p>
<p>The county's transportation has always been convenient. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway obliquely crosses the county, and there are stations in the county seat, as well as Xingzhuang, Xinqiao, Mingxingqiao, Shihuo, and Fengjing. There are seven highways, including Song-Hu, Song-Si, Song-Feng, Hu-Hang, Si-Shi, Pu-Nan, and Yu, connecting all places. Waterways to Shanghai, Pinghu, Jinshan, and other counties have regular small boats coming and going. Since the opening of rice and grain, the amount of food coming to Shanghai via Songjiang from various places has been considerable.</p>
<p>The city is over nine li in circumference, and there are few residents. Within the city, broken walls and ruins are everywhere, and there is no commercial market to speak of, only numerous government offices. The commercial market is most lively in the area outside the West Gate, with stores standing in rows. The streets have been widened after the war, changing the past obstruction. The Dongyue Temple is full of stalls selling groceries and vegetables, somewhat like the City God Temple in Shanghai and the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, but without their neatness. The attached postal city and the underworld are full of decaying statues, and the air is gloomy, said to have been built during the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty. To the southwest of the city is Zui Bai Chi, which was Gu Dashen's villa. It now belongs to the Infant Hall, with small ponds of lotus fragrance and sparse windows and bamboo shadows. The location is secluded, and the scenery is especially clear and quiet.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Illegal Activities</p>
<p>The county borders the East China Sea to the south, and the Huangpu River crosses through it, resulting in a worse environment in the Pu-Nan districts. The northern region has many mountains, which are areas where various troops move in and out. The first, second, fourth, and fifth districts are relatively peaceful. The county's security team × squadron, together with the police station, maintains local order, and public security is improving day by day.</p>
<p>Not long ago, some lawless individuals often went to various shops, restaurants, and hotels, relying on their power to squander and spend without paying a cent. Sometimes they would even use Shen Zhuang's overdue large checks, asking for cash back. Otherwise, they would use their fists and feet, or face each other with weapons. Therefore, the legitimate customers of various shops and hotels would avoid them. Daily business losses were over a million at most, and at least over ten thousand. The shop owners could not bear it, and closed their businesses, turning the only lively market outside the city into a bleak and cold scene. The county authorities, aware of the seriousness of the situation, specially worked with the Allied military police and the police station to strictly crack down and decisively deal with the lawless individuals. They ordered the shops to reopen, and only recently has everything completely cleared up.</p>
<p>Rice and Agricultural Products</p>
<p>The total land area of the county is 967,202 mu, of which 654,671 mu are farmland, mostly paddy fields. The main products are rice and cotton. The annual rice production is about 100,000 shi, wheat and barley about 20,000 shi, cotton about 45,000 dan, rapeseed over 10,000 dan, soybeans over 10,000 dan, and other agricultural products, the amount of which is not easy to estimate.</p>
<p>The county is known as the hometown of rice. Recently, due to the rising cost of living and the heavy burden of various donations and taxes, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the ability to purchase fertilizer is quite weak. Furthermore, due to poor public security in various districts, the output is also decreasing. Comparing the above figures with before the war, it has decreased by five-tenths. Since the lifting of the rice ban, although there has been a constant stream of vendors on the road, the export situation has become ordinary.</p>
<p>Other products, such as the purple perilla of San Mu Tian outside the East Gate and the lotus root of Heyangbang, are better than those elsewhere. The four-gill perch has always been famous, with those produced under Xiuye Bridge being the best. In September of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), Dr. Goto, a first-class Japanese writer, came to Songjiang to specially visit this product. After returning home, he wrote an article "Visit to Songjiang Perch," published in the newspaper. Animal husbandry is mainly chicken and pig farming, which are sold to Shanghai in winter.</p>
<p>Regarding agricultural loans, a branch office was established on July 3rd, and a committee was organized, with the county magistrate and financial giants as members. A sub-office was established under the committee to handle loan matters. It is said that the total amount of loans in Songjiang is 250 million yuan, which will be allocated by the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Products Office. The loans are credit-guaranteed, jointly guaranteed by the township and village chiefs, and each household can borrow up to 250,000 yuan for the purchase of agricultural tools and fertilizers. When asked, local farmers hope that the procedures will be simple and quick to meet their urgent needs; they should be direct and avoid middlemen, in order to increase the use of the funds.</p>
<p>Education and Charity</p>
<p>Jiangsu education was quite developed before the war, with about 220 schools. Afterwards, after many vicissitudes, it declined greatly. Among all school-age children in the county, the proportion of those who have dropped out of school is over seven-tenths. Recently, due to the improper management of education leaders, all facilities are not only following old ways and seeking personal gain, but even embezzling school rents and deducting rice rations, which is outrageous. The current authorities are determined to rectify this, replacing the director of the Education Bureau, using the over 9,000 mu of school land to improve school funding, raising over 10 million yuan from all sectors to subsidize teachers, and planning to provide scholarships to benefit poor students.</p>
<p>Various charitable undertakings are currently managed by the Charity Temporary Relief Association. The Infant Hall, Relief for the Elderly, and the Three Halls currently house 120 elderly people and women, 100 widowed women (an average of three per household), and over 50 infants with disabilities and nursing infants, totaling 4-500 people. Also, the Christian Church used to have a Songjiang Orphanage, housing 80 poor orphans. Recently, it has taken in 35 more orphans (evacuated from Shanghai to Songjiang), totaling 115. The monthly food cost is over 10 million yuan. At this time of high prices, the interruption of food is worrisome. We hope that all benefactors and enthusiastic gentlemen and merchants from Songjiang living in Shanghai will generously donate so that poor and orphaned children will have a place to avoid freezing and starvation.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Discusses Relief for Air Raid Victims Yesterday, Hoping Citizens Will Intensify Air Raid Precautions and Speed Up Evacuation</h3>
<p>On the 17th and 18th of this month, enemy aircraft carried out indiscriminate bombings, resulting in many innocent civilian deaths and injuries, and the destruction of many houses. Municipal Government Secretary-General Luo had personally visited the disaster areas the day before to express condolences on behalf of Mayor Zhou. Yesterday morning (the 19th), he convened a temporary meeting in the Municipal Government conference room, attended by directors of various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government, as well as personnel from the Air Defense Headquarters, to conduct meticulous and practical discussions on issues such as rescuing and providing relief to the affected victims after the enemy air raids. First, Chief of General Affairs Noguchi of the Air Defense Headquarters, Deputy Director Du Zhengjian of the Municipal Police Bureau, and Directors Yuan of the Health Bureau, Liu of the Economic Bureau, of the Education Bureau, and Zhou of the Social Welfare Bureau gave detailed reports. Secretary-General Luo and Deputy Secretary-General Hu gave detailed instructions, urging all colleagues in the bureaus and departments to strive for simplification of administration during this extraordinary period, to do their best to rescue the affected victims, and to quickly adjust any unreasonable phenomena. For example, some hospitals charged huge consultation fees for treating victims injured in air raids, which should be severely punished. He also instructed the health authorities to immediately formulate a comprehensive management plan for the city's hospitals, medical staff, medical supplies, and other resources. Regarding the compensation and reward measures for those injured or killed while rescuing disaster-stricken people, the Air Defense Headquarters was instructed to formulate them as soon as possible so that they could be quickly distributed by the Municipal Government. Other measures, such as the relief for the families of the victims, the provision of food, the announcement of disaster victim or shelter locations, and the announcement of temporary rescue hospitals in various districts, have all been decided and can be implemented immediately. It is especially hoped that citizens will intensify air defense facilities and speed up evacuation to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>Citizens Welfare Association to Hold Emergency Meeting Today</p>
<p>The Citizens Welfare Association, considering that the refugees in this city who have suffered from the air raids are displaced and suffering unbearably and urgently need relief, has decided to hold an emergency meeting at 5 PM today (the 20th) in the Shen Bao Social Conference Room to discuss all matters such as promoting relief work. The list of all directors of the meeting is as follows: Wen Ting, Li Sihao, Zhao Qing, Yuan Ludeng, Ye Fuzhen, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Chen Shao, Chen Riping, Wang Boyuan, Zhu Boquan, Sun Ruihuang, Jiang Shangda, Jin Xiongbo, Chen Bin, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Nanqun, Director General Hu Qi.</p>
<p>Hospitals Receiving the Injured Must Inquire About Names and Addresses</p>
<p>Recently, enemy aircraft have carried out indiscriminate bombings in Shanghai, resulting in many deaths and injuries to innocent civilians. Fortunately, the authorities have perfect air defense facilities and are making special efforts in rescue work. The injured are quickly rescued and sent to various hospitals for treatment. However, in the rush to rescue the injured under air raids, it is difficult to inquire in detail about the names, addresses, and families of the injured, making it difficult to visit and retrieve the injured. In view of this, the Municipal Health Bureau immediately notified all public and private hospitals in the city that they should inquire in detail about the names, addresses, and families of patients received during air raids and record them. If they cannot speak, they can examine their residence permits and record them. Their names and addresses should be disclosed in various newspapers or their families should be notified directly at the address.</p>
<h3>Police Department Orders All Branches to Strengthen Air Defense Facilities and Urges Citizens to Dig Artesian Wells</h3>
<p>In light of the repeated attacks by enemy aircraft on Shanghai, the Municipal Police Department, in order to prepare for any eventuality, has ordered all branches to strengthen air defense facilities. In addition to opening appropriate air raid shelters, they are also digging water storage ponds and wells for air defense, in order to prevent the interruption of tap water supply in case of emergency. At the same time, the public is urged to strengthen air defense facilities. Ideally, each neighborhood should dig an artesian well in order to cope with emergencies.</p>
<p>Air Defense Training Should be Given More Importance</p>
<p>On the 17th and 18th of this month, Shanghai was indiscriminately bombed by enemy American aircraft, resulting in injuries to about 1,500 innocent residents of Chinese, Japanese, and foreign nationalities. However, after this large-scale bombing by enemy aircraft, it is inevitable that they will repeatedly attack again. In view of the tragic damage, citizens must pay more attention to air defense training. The points previously warned by the authorities should be given more attention. Most of the deaths and injuries in the disaster-stricken areas occurred because people did not enter air raid shelters after the police issued warnings, or they looked up at the sky from windows, or they boldly walked on the roads. On the other hand, at a certain Japanese national school in the eastern district, upon hearing the air raid siren, everyone immediately entered the air raid shelter to wait for shelter. Therefore, although they were hit by many direct hits, no one was slightly injured, which shows how important it is to take shelter. In addition, in order to prepare for air raids, clothes and food should be dispersed in advance, and when taking shelter during air raids, or during difficult times, some clothes, enough food for two days, and emergency first aid items such as gauze and disinfectants should be carried. Although the Air Defense Headquarters has made full preparations for the rescue of victims, when the bombed area is large, it is inevitable that there will be areas that cannot be comprehensively taken care of in terms of time. Citizens are urged to pay special attention to this point.</p>
<h3>County Administration Director's Duties to be Acted Upon by Deputy Director</h3>
<p>Cai, the director of the Municipal and County Government Administration Office, was previously transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, and officially took office at the bureau on the first of this month. As the newly appointed Director Shen Xin has not yet taken over, the duties of the vacated Director position are still being handled by him. Now that Cai's affairs at the Finance Bureau are busy, and he is unable to take care of the administrative office affairs, he has applied for and been approved by the Mayor, and before the new director takes over, all duties of the Director of the County Government Administration Office will be temporarily exercised by the Deputy Director Hu Zongwang in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Transactions Subject to Income Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Income Tax Collection Bureau recently received a provisional measure for the collection of Category 1, Item C income tax issued by the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that the bureau has now followed the provisions of Article 3 of this measure, and all those who engage in real estate transactions using speculative profit-making methods will be taxed according to the rules for temporary profit-making businesses. However, real estate companies registered with the government, who pay Category 1, Item A income tax every year, will still be taxed according to the usual practice after the annual accounts are closed, and will be exempt from temporary profit-making income tax. The bureau has separately notified the Municipal Finance and Land Administration Bureaus and relevant agencies to assist. Hereafter, companies and firms that are not registered, or engage in real estate transactions under other names for the purpose of profit, must declare to the bureau before the transaction is concluded. If they are discovered or reported, they will be severely punished according to law and will not be leniently treated.</p>
<h3>Housing Subletting Licenses to Issue Application Forms on a Regular Basis</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau has stipulated that application forms for subletting licenses for landlords in the old 18 districts for the second half of this year will be issued starting on the 25th of this month, in order to fill out and exchange for new licenses.</p>
<h3>Brokerage Firms to Declare Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Association of Brokers of the Chinese Securities Exchange recently notified its members that the method for reporting and paying business tax for the industry has been agreed upon with the authorities. All spring business tax will be reported based on 15 per mille of the business commission income for the three months of October, November, and December of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, plus a 20% late payment penalty. Those with business commission income of one million yuan should pay 18,000 yuan in business tax. In addition, summer business tax will be reported based on 15 per mille of the business commission income for three months of this year's January, but there is no late payment penalty. The application process has already begun.</p>
<p>Reader's Education Aid News</p>
<h3>Hoping Wealthy Families' Children Rise Up to Rescue Those Out of School</h3>
<p>Ms. Chen Xiuqin Takes the Lead in Responding</p>
<p>The most important thing about the educational aid movement is practical action. If I can donate independently, that is the best thing. Even if I don't have the economic ability, I should gather relatives and friends to donate together, introduce them around, and promote each other. Then the goal of 30 million yuan can be achieved in no time. Yesterday, the Zhide Hall recognized a donation to the honorary team, with the Hall's name. They did not want to publicize their real name, which shows the sincerity of their kindness. Peng Xijun and an anonymous person each donated 500,000 yuan, and Zhengda Factory and Xu Jingui each recognized a team. They all came in person in the pouring rain, which is very touching! Rongyi Records adopted the "collective sub-recognition method," donating 100,000 yuan alone, and Hua Ji and Fan Zhi Ji each 50,000 yuan, integrating 200,000 yuan into one team. The people of the same company are very happy to help with education with enthusiasm. We hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will respond and make this year's aid funds achieve their goals as soon as possible, and the merits will be immeasurable! Ms. Chen Xiuqin, a student at Mingde Girls' High School, automatically asked her father to donate a team, and attached a letter advising the children of wealthy families to promote this and rescue out-of-school children together. This young girl has the good heart to cultivate talents, and her father actually promised a lot of money. The perfection of family education can be imagined.</p>
<p>Birthday Gifts All Used for Charity</p>
<p>Peng Xijun wrote in a letter: Yesterday was my humble birthday, and I am deeply grateful for the gifts from relatives and friends. In addition to donating 500,000 yuan to the Xinwen Bao Education Fund, 100,000 yuan each to the Small Business Loan Fund, the Library Fund, and the Medical Loan Fund, and donating 1 million yuan to repair the Hunan Guild Hall, and 50,000 yuan each to the Shanghai Zhongshan Voluntary School, Guangyi School, Shanghai Minyi School, and the Humorous Cartoon Society, I specially send another check for 500,000 yuan, donating it to your newspaper's education fund, as a blessing for relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Feeling Uneasy About Seeing Others Out of School</p>
<p>Chen Xiuqin, a first-year student at Mingde Girls' High School, wrote in a letter: I am a graduate of elementary school and am now entering junior high school. In this situation of soaring prices and rising cost of living, I can still study with peace of mind, which can be said to be fortunate. On the contrary, many children are out of school because their families are poor and their parents cannot afford their tuition fees. How unfortunate and pitiful! Among these unfortunate children, many are very smart and hardworking. How can we watch them drop out of school halfway because they can't afford tuition? Although I can study with peace of mind, I can't bear to watch many children suffer from being out of school. Therefore, I told my parents what I meant and asked them to give me 150,000 yuan to donate to the Shen Bao Education Fund. My father listened and greatly agreed, and immediately gave me a check for 150,000 yuan, but what is the use of 150,000 yuan? This small amount is useless. Although my parents strongly agree with my idea, my family is not wealthy, so I cannot donate a large amount, which is very regrettable. I hope that many children from wealthy families will respond, and accumulating a small amount can help some children who are out of school.</p>

<h3>Donations and Taxes Over 10,000 Yuan Can Be Paid with Sight Drafts</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate citizens' payment of various donations and taxes, the Municipal Finance Bureau has stipulated that from now on, donations and taxes of less than 10,000 yuan should be paid in cash, and amounts of 10,000 yuan or more can be paid with general sight drafts. The collecting agencies must not force the payment of cash. It has been ordered to inform all subordinates.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Negotiable Instruments Every Other Day Mostly Decided</h3>
<p>Due to the recent frequent increase in the number of negotiable instruments among banks and money changers in this city, the exchange procedures have become increasingly difficult, resulting in an increase in the daily exchange differences and the number of returned negotiable instruments. Disputes between customers and customers, and between paying and receiving banks, also arise from this. In order to solve the difficulties and meet the needs, the joint meeting of banks and money changers discussed the exchange of negotiable instruments every other day. As a result, the principle was fully approved, and the detailed rules were decided to be drafted separately by the bankers' and money changers' associations, and then submitted to the joint meeting of banks and money changers for discussion and adoption, and implemented uniformly on a regular basis. According to information from the financial sector, the two associations have both approved the principle of exchanging negotiable instruments every other day, which is inevitable. The two associations have separately submitted the matter to the small group and the practical affairs committee for careful discussion of the articles of implementation rules. The detailed rules of the banking industry have been passed, and the small group meeting of the money changing industry will discuss them again within the day. The official implementation date will be around the end of this month at the latest. However, the original provision in the Negotiable Instruments Law requires that negotiable instruments be exchanged on the same day. Now, due to the factual difficulties of the two industries, in order to prepare for the exchange of negotiable instruments every other day, a document is being prepared to be submitted to the financial authorities of the Ministry of Finance for record, in order to seek a legal basis.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Phase of Gold Securities will Continue to be Issued Within Days, Prices to be Determined According to Reasonable Standards</h3>
<p>Since the issuance of the Central Reserve Bank's gold securities, the gold market has gradually stabilized. After the postponement of the fifth phase of gold securities, due to the stirrings of the speculative market and the incitement of unfounded rumors, the absorption of gold has become increasingly strong, and market prices have skyrocketed, which has greatly affected social people's livelihood and public order. It is reported that the bank is now planning to issue the fifth phase of gold securities within a few days in order to suppress the skyrocketing gold prices and give the speculative merchants a head-on blow. It is reported that the listing price will be determined according to reasonable standards.</p>
<p>Gold Securities Market Conditions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold securities market rose sharply, all breaking through the 7 million mark and closing at the limit, but with demand exceeding supply, trading was not active. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Due Securities: highest 7,080,000 yuan, lowest 6,150,000 yuan, limit 7,080,000 yuan, up 930,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Phase Four Securities: highest 7,130,000 yuan, lowest 6,200,000 yuan, limit 7,130,000 yuan, up 930,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bad Check Case Continues to Develop</h3>
<p>The Lao Zha Police Station recently uncovered a case in which a criminal indiscriminately issued bad checks, defrauding major restaurants and companies of more than 20 million yuan. Further investigation has revealed further developments. It was found that the criminal, Li Afu, also used his friend's "China Industrial Bank" and "Fishery Bank" checkbooks, each, to indiscriminately issue bad checks outside, defrauding people of property. The account names and records have been blurred, but there is a signature of "Li Afu" on the back of each check. Therefore, the police station hopes that if any major stores, companies, or entertainment venues have been victimized by this type of bad check, they should report it to the third section of the police station within two days in order to close the case and transfer it to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Convert Dance Halls into Hospitals for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>On the 17th and 18th of this month, Shanghai was bombed, and I don't know how much damage the citizens' lives and property suffered. The tragic situation of severed heads and broken feet is truly unbearable to look at. In such a serious environment, no one can guarantee what will happen tomorrow, and there is a possibility of being cruelly sacrificed at any time. According to the human duty of helping each other in the same boat, no one can avoid it. Everyone should do their best to rescue and help those in disaster. In view of the lack of hospitals to treat severely injured citizens, I suggest borrowing many dance halls in the city as temporary hospitals. I remember that during the early days of the August 13th Incident, many dance halls in the concessions were converted into temporary refugee shelters and hospitals for wounded soldiers, turning places of extravagant enjoyment into places that express the spirit of human mutual assistance. Today's situation is no less serious than in the past. I sincerely hope that the authorities and enthusiastic people from all walks of life will give this matter more consideration, and the disaster victims will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Please Set Up a Refugee Relief Committee Immediately by the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>— Huan</p>
<p>Enemy aircraft have launched large-scale attacks on Shanghai for days, indiscriminately bombing the city. The northeastern district of the city has suffered heavy damage, many civilian houses have collapsed, and about a thousand civilians have been killed or injured. Regarding emergency relief measures for disaster victims, it is reported that enthusiastic people from all walks of life have initiated the organization of a temporary refugee relief association to handle relief work.</p>
<p>However, enemy aircraft may come to attack more frequently in the future! Any corner of this city is vulnerable to bombing. We should now prepare for air defense equipment and rescue work, and at the same time, we cannot ignore the issue of relief after the disaster. I believe that the Municipal Standing Committee should immediately organize a city-wide refugee relief committee, unite with enthusiastic people from all walks of life in this city to work together, and pre-plan specific relief measures for the entire city. In addition to allocating regular expenses from the government, it can also actively raise donations from all walks of life to prepare for temporary relief. The current work of the committee can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Raise funds and foundation: The committee's regular office expenses can be designated by the municipal government for a certain amount as a subsidy. As for the relief expenses, they are quite large, and there should be full preparation as early as possible to avoid digging a well only when thirsty. If a huge amount of funds can be raised, it should be managed by a management committee organized by the municipal government together with impartial people from society.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the post-disaster issues in the disaster area: In the bombed disaster area, walls are broken, corpses are lying horizontally, and the aftermath should be dealt with, especially in this summer, which is even more harmful to public health. Therefore, the work of concentrating, storing, and burying corpses, clearing rubble and roads, and repairing collapsed houses is urgent.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding refugee relief issues: Most of the disaster-stricken refugees have lost their families and their properties have been destroyed. The situation of orphans and widows who have lost their homes and are displaced is especially tragic. In order to seek temporary relief, it is necessary to pre-arrange several refugee shelters so that in the event of an accident, the disaster victims can be concentrated and taken care of, solving the problem of their residence. At the same time, the problem of their food should also be solved, such as providing porridge or bread to avoid the suffering of hunger, and then overall arrange for their post-disaster measures, classify the situation, order them to evacuate to their original residence or other designated locations, or transfer them to charitable organizations for adoption, so as to ensure that innocent disaster victims can obtain appropriate homes and not be in a dead end and have no way to complain.</p>
<p>The above points are only a few of the major points of the relief work. As for the organization of the Refugee Relief Committee and the entire method, it remains to be adopted by the Municipal Government and carefully discussed. I hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will cooperate and promote this as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Relief for Air Raid Victims: Donations from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>On the 17th and 18th of this month, this city suffered air raids, and the civilians in the Hudong district suffered the most, with many displaced and homeless people. Yesterday, this newspaper published that various social organizations will promote relief work, and enthusiastic people from all walks of life have sent donations to this newspaper. This newspaper believes that relief is a matter of great importance and should not be shirked, and has already begun to collect donations on behalf of others. In one day, a total of more than 15 million yuan was received, which shows that all walks of life care about the disaster situation and cooperate in donating to help the disaster victims, which is truly immeasurable merit.</p>
<p>This newspaper will announce the names of the donors and show appreciation. It will also transfer the donations collected on behalf of others to formal relief organizations for distribution and use. I also ask that influential people from all walks of life, with a human heart, continue to make generous donations to achieve great results. The details of donations received are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Yizhong Coal Industry Company wrote in a letter: "This city has suffered sudden air raids these days, and residents have been killed and injured. The company has donated 15 million yuan to be evenly distributed to your newspaper and the Xinwen Bao and Dalu Xinwen Bao on behalf of the victims. Enclosed is a check for 5 million yuan. Please accept it."</p>
<p>(2) Qi Wenzhi, Wang Zizhi, and 19 others wrote in a letter: "This time, the northeastern region of this city suffered a tragic bombing, with more than a thousand casualties, which is unbearable to hear. We witnessed this and could not sit idly by. We have collected donations of 5 million yuan and sent a letter. Please accept it and forward it to the relief agencies to fulfill our obligations as citizens. We are grateful."</p>
<p>(3) Bu Liang, accountant of Pingliang Law and Accounting Firm, wrote in a letter: "This city has been bombed, and countless innocent civilians have been killed and injured. They are in dire need of help. Zhengtai Firm has collected 1.5 million yuan and instructed us to transfer it to the relief agencies. Enclosed is a check. We are grateful."</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Xie Jikai wrote in a letter: "I have been living in Shanghai for more than ten years and have been ill for many years, relying on the care of relatives and friends. I am grateful for their kindness. Recently, this city has been bombed, and the civilians in the Hudong district have suffered even more, and are in need of relief. I have prepared a check for 1 million yuan and sent it to you for collection and transfer to the relief agencies, hoping to inspire others to donate."</p>
<p>(5) Rencheng Firm wrote in a letter: "The colleagues of the firm, in view of the heavy casualties, we have collected 1 million yuan in relief funds, which we would like to send to you for transfer, and to express our humble devotion."</p>
<p>Jiming Hospital Offers Free Treatment</p>
<p>Jiming Hospital has launched free medical treatment for civilians injured in air raids. Anyone injured in air raids can be sent to the hospital for treatment (free of charge) from July 21. It has also set up a hundred sickbeds to provide free hospitalization and treatment for those seriously injured. It is reported that the funds needed, in addition to being raised by the hospital's colleagues, are feared to be a drop in the bucket and will not help much. A special appeal is made to all walks of life to donate. Those who wish to donate money and medicine can send them to the following collection points for official receipts: (1) Donation Collection Points: Changcheng Bank (123 Dashalu), Huatai Bank (37 Tianjin Road), Zhenfeng Qianzhuang (229 Shandong Road), Guo Yu Qianzhuang (290 Beijing Road), (2) Collection of Medicines: Shanghai Jiming Hospital (end of North Xizang Road).</p>
