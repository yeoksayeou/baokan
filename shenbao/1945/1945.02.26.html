<p>自民國三十一年元旦，領袖汪故主席手頒新國民運動凋要，　於團結民還愛　同之組織訓練，集中意志，充實國力，於精神建設與物質建設兩者同時幷進，俾能負荷復興中華，保衛東亞之偉大使命。所謂精神建設，常以革除缺點發揮擾點爲重，領袖於新國民運動綱要中，曾明白指出現在四年有餘之中日事變，已一轉而爲保衛東亞的大戰爭，在道新關頭沒有新精神，怎樣能担負這新責任，完成這使命。所謂新精神不完全指創造，只要能除去舊染之汚，也是自新之一着，換句話說：要有勇氣來承認缺點，　正缺點，尤其是劣點，更要有勇氣來掃蕩廓淸新國民運動，就是着重於此。今日新運之推進，已進入實踐階段，於精神建設方面，首當針對我國國所民一般固有之缺點，即所謂舊染之汚，謀所以掃蕩康淸之，同時更進一步謀國民優點之發揮光大，創造民族光輝蓬勃之新精神，然後非但物質建設之或功可期，即完成興華保亞偉業之初基，亦奏於日。本此主旨，爰有「新國民運動行動規律實踐項目」之頒訂，希國人共同奮起，身體而力行之，茲制定第一年自本年三月至八月爲推行期，踐實項目如左；</p>

<h3 id="c14">簡政問題 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>簡政問題，在兩年前，木報會一再提出過，當時因宥於種種條件，未能即時實現，以之納政治於常軌。在時問上說，不爲不久，不過，一種轉變，或者一種改革，必須有一定的過程，所謂時機成熟，則輕而易舉。現在這個簡政問題，巳由我們輿論界的要求而成爲政府强化政治和安定民生的施政方針了，這是今年政治上非常可喜的事情。</p>
<p>其次，以前是上令下不行，政府的施策，下屬或地方行政機構往往有玩忽政令的現象，現在呢？則不同了，譬如最近中樞爲適應戰時需要，講求簡政辦法，業經通過二個原則，幷擬定辦法，明令公佈實行。而居全國重要行政單位的上海，常局能首先依照中樞簡政計劃實行革新，周市長日前在上海市政諮詢委員會的首决報吿，其中所述各點及巳實行的辦法，完全根據了中樞行政簡素的意志，同時又充分表現了政令統一的精神。</p>
<p>中樞所頒佈的簡政原則及辦法，是指導全國實行簡政的原則。上海市政的革新及周市長的工作報吿，在推進簡政的意義上，有極重要的兩點。（一）上海是全國行政單位中最重要的一部份，當局者首先實行簡政，顯然有把上海造成模範的簡政區的意思；（二）全部工作計劃，是實行簡政的具體做法，適合上海市民的需要，上海市民所需者，能爲全國人民所同樣需要，所以它的具體做法，可供其他行政單位實行簡政的參考。</p>
<p>簡政的最高目標是提高行政效率。所以中樞講求簡政辦法的決定很簡單，祗有兩個原則，而這原則的規定條文，又很簡明，一個是變更組織（包括裁併及增設），另一個是核議機關及手續力求簡的。這是說明中樞簡政的精神。就已逐步實行簡政的上海市政來講，也是着重於行政效率的提高。所以周市長在諮詢會上的報吿，把「內部整飭」列在第一部。而內部整飭，第一是縮小機構，機構的縮小，是要取消疊床架屋的錦張現象，可以節省人力物力，因之使「責任不明，權限不淸。有利則互爭，有事則互諉」的消蝕行政效率的因素沒有，所以毫不遲疑把公用局和工務局合併爲建設局。同時，爲適應現實環境的需要，又增設「縣政管理處」和「人口疏散委員會」。對於用人方面，「縣政管理處所用的人限於極少限度，人口疏散委員會辦事的人完全是調用的」。根據這幾點，上海市政的簡化，很能發揮了目前簡政的精神。也惟有先把這幾點做個澈底，然後第二點的裁汰不必要的冗員，和第三點的勵行紀律以及第四點的提高待遇，才能跟着澈底實現。</p>
<p>簡政的要旨是「法簡民便」，如果照目前的說法，便是安定民生。這點與提高行政效率有相互的關係，所以周市長在報吿中提到一般設施的重心時，把整理財政列爲第一項，這樣，一方面使所有收入，全歸政府，得以收支平衡，不致影饗簡政的推行，另一方面調整捐稅，不使人民負担太重。同時，力阻人爲的漲價，盡最大的努力，達成確立治安的任務，而對封鎖管理亦加以改良。這些都是證明市政當局對實行簡政抱有莫大的決心和熱情。</p>
<p>提高行政效率，執行較易，然安定民生却很難，所以周市長在報吿中提到安定民生一點時說：「本人　職前後的幾月，米價略爲安定，大家歸功於我，說因爲我做了市長，所以米價跌了。這乃是偶然凑合的事，決不是我的功勞，我決不敢貪天之功，以爲已有。前幾天米價忽然漲了，這個責任，如果說完全應歸赤手空拳的市政府去負，也未免太酷。」市府的困難，經過周市長率直的表明之後，人民都有了具體的認識和諒解。但是，目前的米價，已非一週前的情形了，我們如聽共自然發展，那麼過去的情形，可能重演，成爲簡政上的阻碍。</p>
<p>此外，我們覺得，簡政是非澈底推行不可，中樞已有明令公佈原則及辦法，希望上海市政當局根據已定工作計劃努力求其實現，眞能成爲全國的模範。同時，盼望其他省市縣的當局，接踵而起，實行簡政。，兇案發生後，國會立即停會，該消息立刻傳遍開羅，警察當即大批出動以防變亂‘衆院議長宣佈國會僅限一門出外，凡離院者將受嚴密之檢查，並須呈示其證明書。</p>

<p>滬市金融與工商各業市况，最近一週因受歐局流言影響，復起劇烈波動，一般游資都轉烚赤公偵之俄帝活動，故金融方面，以烚赤公債，漲風最烈，烚赤最高峯超過大結果前暗市收盤價差一倍之鉅。以週三週四兩天暴漲之勢，戾屬駭聞，旋有多頭見勢乘高大批吐售，人心稍弱，價見反跌，至週六退落九關有奇，但仍較前週漲超百分之三十以上。公債漲勢不弱烚赤，惟購吸者不及烚赤之盛，蓋人心羣趨於購買黃金以爲善策。華股雖以銀根鬆弛，多頭吸收，以致股市一度漲風甚甚厲，但僅係永安公司，永安紗廠，美亞綢廠之熱門股之交易繁鬧，其他各種股市仍無生色，一般市儈視股市淡漠如水，散欲振起評交，尙非其時。在此一週內之金融事業，因舊歷年習風未了，各行莊於款尙未展開進行，故無善乏述。錢業拆息始終站六角五分未更，惟暗息續見提高。關於工商方而，各業工廠依然以電力之不繼，無法開工生產，是以影響物價之躍進，幸經市經濟局對抑平物價採取緊急措置，重行核定十六種，其中四種因係統制品，故未核定發表。主要商品新阻價公布執行，幷由經濟警察局協助執行，故而物價漲勢欲躍未能。惟在週五週六兩日之問，米價又起漲風，其他日用品批發價仍然高昇，此頗使抑平物價當局及一般市民之期待，頓成泡影，尤望經濟執行當局，切勿漠視此種形式之發展，迅速澈　核其根本原因，而執行嚴峻之懲處，以符安定民生之旨。</p>

<p>上海特別市警察局第二處副處處長薛志良，日前在上海電台廣播市民建築防空樣之意義，其大意謂：</p>
<p>功效顯著</p>
<p>現在防空態勢之中，最弱點爲防空壕之笛構築遲慢，古云防患於未然，有備無患，現在英國德國在轟炸危險下，各大都市一般市民之生活或一切之樞要機關工塲等，大概全部都高在地下，即所謂防空壕。日本內地之各大都市對防空壕之構築，頗爲普遍，最近之B29型爆炸機，雖然屢次侵襲，而被害者却寥寥無幾。又最近經本局派到漢口實地調查人員之報吿，彼等利用絨毯式之爆炸，而日本人雖遭此等轟炸，其實列傷者全無。經考查其結果，乃普及利用防空壕之成效，其防護生命之顯著效果，已完全證實。那麼我們再看一看上海的防空壕，確不十分發達，此乃事實。上海之每個家庭·全市民·工場·銀行·公司·商店及其他一切之公共塲所等，在空襲時須一人不留，必須躱避。希望各位市民急速構築防空壕，以策安全。</p>
<p>構築地點</p>
<p>防空壕之構築，須要選擇適當地點，構築方法需要具體化，其材料要簡單，容易入手，其構築用具之配合須相同。但是雖有種種困難問題，照上海之防空事態，須要克復一切障碍，排除萬難。現在已進入急迫構築防空壕之狀態，構築之塲所，先要選擇在自憶居住的地方附近爲標準，遇有空襲時，要最迅速到達其地點，並且要立即躱避。一般家庭中，屋外或屋內設置防空壕，可各自決定，即住宅之附近，如有適當空地，亦可利用之。再在住宅稠密之處，其附近如無適當之空地，則選擇房屋比較堅固之處，能够容易躱避之處，在屋內構築。我想並沒有障碍，只要找適當空地之有無，又房屋內不適構築時，在道路上如或選擇公其空地等也可。但是在地下有公共煤氣管。自來水管。地下電綫等埋沒物之關係，須要求市政府工務處之許可，此項要求，市政府定極力予以便利，請諸君不要客氣，可隨時到所管轄之警察分局申請。</p>
<p>構築方法</p>
<p>其次構築方法，有種種不同，上海之現狀，掘到地下不出水爲度，然後地上用土堆上，所謂半地下式方可，其大小之程度，以其各個收容人員而定，每個待避所最多十五人爲度，出入門需設兩處，以堅固木材，竹桂木樑，外部用土第七堆積，上蓋甲板，或蓆子，再上邊用土砂堆起，須有一尺深，附近不得有磚瓦片石子等，以防高射砲彈飛散到土砂之內，發生危險。其次兩門口務須要設置堅牢之物，以防瀑風，其內尤須要留意衛生及防止漏水，此乃構築者或其管理者平常須要注意之點。壕內有無漏水之處，防空壕周謂之堆土，堅固與否，其附近有無磚瓦及彈片等物，有則須拋除爲要，以防危險</p>
<p>建築地窖</p>
<p>防空地庫（地窖）所以收納貴重品，重要物品及其也必需物件以防火災。地下窖庫地窖，對於防火上之效果，極爲顯著，許多之火災經實例實騐而得證明。日本內地的實騐，其火災家屋內之溫度，已達攝氏溫度甚高，在此屋內地下距離十五糎深地下地窖內，溫度僅二十度內外，收納之物件，帳簿衣料食料等或最容易起火之揮發油等物。也並無有何等異狀。而在空襲時，或作防空活動時，必須設備窖，將其重要物品收納起來，以防危險，方可無患，萬一緊急避難時，貴重品重要物品或生活必需品等，都要携帶，這是不可能的。在大多數人之避難，以期保持安全起見，絕對禁止携帶物件，所以各戶必須設備地窖，保護重要物品，其容易燃燒之危險物品等，必須收納於地窖內。</p>
<p>地窖構造</p>
<p>地窖設置塲所屋內或屋外均可，其大小以收納物品適當就可，地窖之構造，用鐵筋洋灰或磚瓦不等，爲最適宜，倘無此種東西者，用木箱鐵箱或廢物西洋浴盆都可，將其理入地下，收納貴重物品，及食糧乖物裝入後，將蓋蓋好，其上端堆以砂土，其程度以三十糎（約一尺）厚爲宜。（注意要點）防止磚瓦建築房屋倒壞，重量過重，須不使地窖受損害，及妨害避難，並防地窖中出水，浸入物件內，避難時要迅速將物件裝入地窖內，設備必須完善。以上簡單之陳述，希望各位市民照辦。</p>

<p>Eastern Pacific Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Air Force fiercely bombed the enemy bridgehead on the southern coast of Iwo Jima on the 23rd, with all bombs hitting their targets. Several large fires broke out. Furthermore, the enemy positions there were fiercely bombed again on the night of the 24th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - One week has passed since the enemy landed on Iwo Jima on the 19th. Due to the valiant fighting of the Japanese garrison on the island, the enemy has been unable to advance. The Japanese forces are still securing key positions such as Mount Suribachi, continuing to inflict significant damage on the enemy. At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, the enemy launched an attack on Asoga with a force of about one company, carrying tanks. The Japanese artillery units accurately shelled them, destroying one tank and killing or wounding 200 infantry soldiers, repelling the attack. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, the enemy again attacked Kita-Oka, north of the Chishima settlement, with 300 infantry soldiers and three tanks. The Japanese garrison engaged them in fierce fighting for one hour, completely annihilating one company of the enemy and destroying one of their tanks. By 4:00 PM, the enemy had ceased their attack and began to collect their wounded. Furthermore, from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 23rd, the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy naval vessels off the coast of Iwo Jima, confirming that one unidentified vessel caught fire and sank, while another vessel suffered an explosion in its stern. In addition, five fires could be seen burning at sea from a distance. A unit of the Japanese Air Force bombed the enemy bridgehead on the southern coast, throwing the enemy into great chaos. Starting from the evening of the day until dawn on the 24th, the entire Japanese line launched a major assault operation, capturing a large number of tanks. However, the detailed battle results have not yet been determined. From the start of the enemy landing operation until the 22nd, the ground battle results include the destruction of 160 tanks, the bombing and burning of numerous cargo trucks, ammunition, and supplies, and the killing or wounding of 17,000 enemy soldiers by the evening of the 22nd. If the casualties and wounded from the 24th are included, the number is even more considerable.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The 11th Division, the main force of the Northern Yunnan Expeditionary Army of the Chongqing National Government, is regrouping within Chinese territory north of  Ding Street to rebuild its fighting strength. The 4th Division, commanded by Sultan, is still facing off against the Japanese forces to defend the Stilwell Road. The newly formed First Army has been attacking near the provincial capital since the 19th, and the Japanese forces in that area are currently facing off against approximately 2,000 Chongqing troops with 30 tanks. The Japanese forces on the Monto front have been successfully attacking the Indian 36th Army near the northern vicinity of Myitkyina. By the 15th, they had pushed the enemy back to the west bank of the Si-Eri River and annihilated them. On the 17th, they further carried out mopping-up operations against some remaining enemy troops, inflicting thorough damage. As of the 17th, the enemy's losses from one division included 1,383 bodies left behind, 11 artillery pieces, 116 firearms, 14 pieces of military equipment, two large sunken boats, and twelve small boats, as well as a large amount of supplies and clothing. The 14th Army's main attack point in the Mendron area remains focused on the Mim front. With a strong armored force comprising two divisions, they began a forced river crossing on the 13th. After the Japanese forces launched a daring counterattack, the enemy seemed to reinforce their support and attempted to cross the river again. The 19th Division on the east bank of the Irrawaddy River gradually increased its river-crossing forces from the Hsin-Ko area. Furthermore, the enemy forces advancing southward on the west bank of the Wan River toward the Pakokku front were attacked by the 5th Division, while the East African 11th Division attacked the northwest area of Sekbyulan. They were met with a Japanese counterattack, and the enemy has already suffered over 6,900 casualties. On the Arakan front, the enemy 15th Army is strengthening its naval and air bases in the Akjab-Ranli area. At the same time, they have dispatched the West African 81st Division to advance southward toward Gangaw and Tamandu. Furthermore, a part of the 25th Division carried out a seaborne maneuver, landing south of Tamandu on the 16th and gradually expanding their bridgehead.</p>

<h3 id="e12">New Life Movement Revised; First Phase of Practice Items <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The New Life Movement Promotion Committee, in order to strengthen the close training of the general public, has planned to actively launch the organization of New Life Movement practice groups from all sectors. With the promotion of the New Life Movement practice movement as the focus of its work, the committee has specifically revised the "First Phase of Practice Items for the New Life Movement Action Regulations." The original text is extracted below:</p>
<p>Since the first day of the 31st year of the Republic, leader and former Chairman Wang personally promulgated the essential points of the New Life Movement to unite the people and strengthen the organization and training of the people. Focus on concentration of will and enrich the national strength to advance simultaneously in both spiritual and material construction, so as to be able to bear the great mission of rejuvenating China and protecting East Asia. The so-called spiritual construction often focuses on removing shortcomings and developing strengths. The leader, in the outline of the New Life Movement, clearly pointed out that the Sino-Japanese Incident, which has been going on for more than four years, has transformed into a great war to protect East Asia. Without a new spirit at this new juncture, how can we shoulder this new responsibility and accomplish this mission? The so-called new spirit does not completely refer to creation, as long as the pollution of old habits can be removed, it is also a step towards self-renewal. In other words, there must be the courage to admit shortcomings, correct shortcomings, and especially weaknesses. There must be even more courage to sweep away and clarify. The New Life Movement focuses on this. Today, the promotion of the New Life Movement has entered the practical stage. In terms of spiritual construction, we should first target the inherent shortcomings of our nation, that is, the so-called pollution of old habits, and seek to eliminate and clarify them. At the same time, we should further seek to develop and expand the strengths of the people, creating a new spirit of national glory and vigor. Then, not only can material construction be successful, but also the initial foundation for completing the great cause of rejuvenating China and protecting Asia will be laid. Based on this goal, the "Practice Items for the New Life Movement Action Regulations" are promulgated, hoping that the people of the country will rise up together, embody them, and put them into practice. The first year, from March to August of this year, is designated as the promotion period. The practice items are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Problem of Streamlining Administration <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The problem of streamlining administration has been repeatedly raised by our newspaper two years ago. At that time, due to various conditions, it could not be realized immediately, so as to bring politics into a normal track. In terms of time, it was not long ago. However, a transformation or a reform must have a certain process. When the so-called time is ripe, it will be easy to achieve. Now this problem of streamlining administration has become the government's policy to strengthen politics and stabilize people's livelihood due to the demands of our public opinion circles. This is a very gratifying thing in politics this year.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the past, orders from above were not followed below. Subordinates or local administrative institutions often neglected government orders. But now? It is different. For example, recently, the central government has adopted two principles to adapt to the needs of wartime and seek ways to streamline administration, and has formulated measures and clearly announced their implementation. Shanghai, which is an important administrative unit in the country, was able to take the lead in implementing reforms in accordance with the central government's streamlining plan. Mayor Zhou's first resolution report at the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee fully reflects the will of the central government to simplify administration and also fully demonstrates the spirit of unified government orders.</p>
<p>The principles and measures promulgated by the central government are the principles to guide the implementation of streamlining administration throughout the country. The reforms of the Shanghai Municipal Government and Mayor Zhou's work report have two very important points in promoting the significance of streamlining administration. (1) Shanghai is the most important part of the country's administrative units. The authorities first implemented streamlining administration, which clearly has the meaning of making Shanghai a model streamlined administration area. (2) The entire work plan is a concrete practice of implementing streamlining administration, which meets the needs of the citizens of Shanghai. What the citizens of Shanghai need can also be needed by the people of the whole country, so its concrete practice can be used as a reference for other administrative units to implement streamlining administration.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of streamlining administration is to improve administrative efficiency. Therefore, the central government's decision to seek ways to streamline administration is very simple. There are only two principles, and the provisions of these principles are very clear. One is to change the organization (including mergers and additions), and the other is to strive for simplicity in the review of institutions and procedures. This explains the spirit of the central government's streamlining administration. As far as the Shanghai Municipal Government, which has gradually implemented streamlining administration, is concerned, it also focuses on improving administrative efficiency. Therefore, Mayor Zhou put "internal rectification" in the first part of his report to the advisory committee. The first is to reduce the size of the organization. The reduction of the organization is to eliminate the phenomenon of redundant layers, which can save manpower and resources, thereby eliminating the factors that erode administrative efficiency, such as "unclear responsibilities, unclear powers, mutual competition for benefits, and mutual evasion of responsibilities," so it did not hesitate to merge the Public Works Bureau and the Public Affairs Bureau into the Construction Bureau. At the same time, in order to adapt to the needs of the real environment, it also added the "County Administration Management Office" and the "Population Evacuation Committee." In terms of employment, "the people used by the County Administration Management Office are limited to a very small number, and the people working for the Population Evacuation Committee are all transferred." Based on these points, the simplification of the Shanghai Municipal Government can very well develop the current spirit of streamlining administration. Only by thoroughly implementing these points first can the second point of cutting unnecessary redundant staff, the third point of enforcing discipline, and the fourth point of improving treatment be thoroughly realized.</p>
<p>The gist of streamlining administration is "simple laws and convenient people," which, if put in current terms, means stabilizing people's livelihood. This point is related to improving administrative efficiency, so Mayor Zhou mentioned that when it comes to the focus of general facilities, putting the reorganization of finance as the first item. In this way, on the one hand, all income is attributed to the government, so as to balance revenue and expenditure, so as not to affect the promotion of streamlining administration. On the other hand, adjust donations and taxes so as not to burden the people too much. At the same time, it makes every effort to prevent artificial price increases and achieve the task of establishing security, and also improve blockade management. These all prove that the municipal authorities have great determination and enthusiasm for implementing streamlining administration.</p>
<p>Improving administrative efficiency is easier to implement, but stabilizing people's livelihood is very difficult. Therefore, Mayor Zhou said in his report when mentioning the point of stabilizing people's livelihood: "In the few months before and after I took office, the price of rice was slightly stable, and everyone attributed it to me, saying that the price of rice fell because I became mayor. This is just a coincidence, not my merit. I dare not take credit for what belongs to Heaven and think that I already have it. A few days ago, the price of rice suddenly rose, and if the responsibility for this is said to be entirely borne by the city government, which is empty-handed, it is too harsh." After Mayor Zhou frankly stated the difficulties of the municipal government, the people have a concrete understanding and understanding. However, the current price of rice is no longer the same as it was a week ago. If we let it develop naturally, then the past situation may be repeated, becoming an obstacle to streamlining administration.</p>
<p>In addition, we feel that streamlining administration must be thoroughly implemented. The central government has already clearly announced the principles and measures. We hope that the Shanghai Municipal Government will make efforts to achieve its implementation based on the established work plan and truly become a model for the whole country. At the same time, we hope that the authorities of other provinces, cities, and counties will follow suit and implement streamlining administration. After the murder occurred, the Congress immediately adjourned. The news quickly spread throughout Cairo. The police immediately dispatched a large number of people to prevent unrest. The Speaker of the House announced that Congress was limited to one exit. Anyone leaving the House will be subject to strict inspection and must present their certificate.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency reports from Cairo that Egyptian King Farouk has instructed Foreign Minister Muklashy to act as Prime Minister. It is generally expected that there will be no changes in the government. It is said that Foreign Minister Muklashy has always been the right-hand man of the late Prime Minister Maher.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Anglo-American Forces' 40 Divisions Launch Offensive on Western Front; Massive Deployment of Aircraft and Heavy Artillery <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, February 25th, Central News Agency dispatch: A German news agency reports that a German military spokesperson announced yesterday that the Anglo-American forces have mobilized a total of 40 divisions in their current offensive on the Western Front. The offensive is expected to extend to neighboring areas soon, with the battle lines on the Western Front projected to reach 200 kilometers in length.</p>
<p>Berlin, February 25th, Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency report: The Allied forces' new offensive in the Aachen area involves an unprecedented deployment of aircraft and artillery since the invasion of Europe. The Allied air power used during the Normandy landings was less than that deployed in the Ruhr area in the past 24 hours. This demonstrates the importance the Allied command attaches to this large-scale offensive. The offensive is currently underway in a concentrated manner within a 40-kilometer zone between Linnich and Geilenkirchen. On the northern route, the Canadian 10th Corps and the British 2nd Corps are launching large-scale offensives. On the southern route, the US 3rd Army is also launching a large-scale offensive. The US 1st and 9th Armies are attempting to reach the east bank of the Ruhr River, and despite heavy losses, they have successfully crossed the river at several points. By Friday evening, the furthest advance of US troops on the east bank was only three kilometers. US tank divisions have mostly not yet joined the battle, awaiting orders. The war on the Western Front is now developing towards its peak.</p>

<p>Berlin, February 25th, Central News Agency dispatch: A German news agency reports that yesterday marked the 25th anniversary of the National Socialist Party's declaration of its twenty-five principles. Führer Hitler addressed the old comrades of the party, stating, "February 24, 1920, will be a great milestone in human history. Without the construction of the National Socialist Party, there would be no Germany and no German nation today. Heaven does not pity weak nations, only acknowledging the right of healthy and strong nations to exist. The unnatural alliance of capitalism and communism now threatens the world with death. Twenty-five years ago, Germany was prepared to challenge this threat to defend the survival of the German nation. Today, Germany must overcome the bourgeois democratic ideals and eliminate communism." The Führer's speech was delivered yesterday by State Councilor Esser at a meeting of old comrades in Munich.</p>

<h3 id="e19">City Police Bureau Smashes Major Gambling Den; Den Owner Wang Maoting and Others All Apprehended <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The City Police Bureau has received numerous confidential reports that a criminal named Wang Maoting has been using the Russian General Association at 147 Weihaiwei Road as a front for a private gambling den, attracting crowds to gamble. This is extremely illegal. While under strict investigation, the den owner brazenly attempted to bribe Director Li of the Xin cheng sub-bureau, the responsible authority, with 300,000 yuan, attempting to operate privately like the gambling dens in the Nanshi area in the past. After receiving the bribe, Director Li immediately reported it to his superiors and also reported the details of the "Big Road Pai Gow," "Hua Yu," "Big and Small Tables," "Roulette" and "French Baccarat" gambling equipment inside the gambling den, as well as the internal operations, requesting instructions for handling the case. The Bureau immediately ordered the Third Division to quickly investigate and crack the case.</p>
<p>Setting Up a Secret Trap to Arrest Wang Maoting</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the head of the Third Division, Li Shi, immediately transferred the case to Liu Shaokui, the investigation and trial section chief, and Liu Junqing, the third section director of the Xin cheng sub-bureau, the responsible authority. They each dispatched detectives to conduct a strict investigation. Section Chief Liu then dispatched detective chief Shi Weimeng to cooperate with Zhou Wenqing, detective of the third section of the Xin cheng sub-bureau, selected by Director Liu, as well as detectives Li Dewei and Lu Yuheng to work together to solve the case. However, in order to apprehend Wang Maoting first and then smash the gambling den without making a sound, so as to catch everyone in one fell swoop, a plan was discussed and decided in advance, and a secret trap was set up. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, detectives gathered at the gambling den, pretending to be gamblers, secretly monitoring Wang Mao's activities. At 8:40 PM, Wang, along with his son Wang Shuhao and friend Sun Huanting, left in a car. The detectives had been waiting nearby and followed them to the intersection of Chongqing Road, where they stopped the car under the guise of inspection and took Wang back to the Xin cheng sub-bureau. Section Chief Liu and Director Liu interrogated him in detail, and Wang confessed to the aforementioned situation, stating that he had put up about 6 million yuan to open the gambling den at the Russian Overseas Chinese Association, signed a contract with a Russian, and hired a person named Meng Qing to manage the operation. After discussion and decision by Director Li, Section Chief Liu, and Director Liu, and with the approval of their superiors, they personally led police officers to the Russian Overseas Chinese Association.</p>
<p>Surrounding the Gambling Den, Catching Everyone in One Fell Swoop</p>
<p>Led by Director Li, Section Chief Liu, and Director Liu, dozens of police officers secretly surrounded the gambling den with armed police officers first. Then, detectives rushed into the gambling den. Just as the gamblers were in high spirits, using lightning-fast methods, they went to the gambling rooms on the first, second, and third floors, separated the gamblers, and immediately seized six dice cups, six sets of Pai Gow, three large bags of chips, 32 French Baccarat gambling equipment, four rosewood copper plates, one roulette gambling equipment, three small safes, six small iron boxes, three rosewood long planks, and other gambling equipment, as well as 2,644,150 yuan in cash, five remittance slips totaling 178,000 yuan, seven checks totaling 670,000 yuan, and seven promissory notes totaling 210,000 yuan. In the pawn department on the third floor, they confiscated a small gold bar, five gold bracelets, two diamond rings, one platinum ring, thirteen gold rings, three gold pocket watches, one gold chain, one pocket watch, and one small round watch. The gambling den's staff counted the items on the spot, and the suspects were taken to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Arresting Hundreds of Gambling Offenders</p>
<p>A total of 174 gamblers and employees were arrested in this case, including six Japanese nationals, three French nationals (who have been handed over to their respective consulates for investigation), one Portuguese national, one Spanish national, two Indian nationals, one Danish national, and thirty Russian nationals. The rest were all Chinese nationals, including ninety-nine men and thirty-one women. Yang Lianfu, an employee of the gambling den, jumped out of a window in an attempt to escape, resulting in serious injuries, and has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Fresh Meat Retailers Fail to Comply with New Price Limits <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Fresh meat prices had previously soared to 1,000 yuan per catty due to the Lunar New Year holidays. Based on the central government's policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices, the Municipal Price Evaluation Council took emergency measures, initially re-establishing price limits for the top sixteen major commodities. Fresh meat was also among the major commodities, with first-class meat set at 800 yuan per catty, second-class at 750 yuan, and third-class at 400 yuan. However, the general selling price on the market still does not comply with the price limit. Among the unpriced items, such as pig liver, the price has soared to 1,600 yuan per catty. It is hoped that the evaluation authorities will quickly order the industry to comply and also quickly price the unpriced pork parts to relieve the public food supply.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Stores Raising Prices Privately Can Be Reported to the Police <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The authorities, recognizing that soaring prices in the city have a huge impact on the stability of people's livelihoods, have issued fixed prices for major items and strongly declared their determination to suppress and stabilize prices. Since implementation, most speculative merchants have complied. Citizens have expressed their support for the authorities' decisive measures. According to a reporter's investigation, a small number of limited-price items have violated the assessed prices again. Such a situation is deplorable. It is reported that the relevant parties are currently conducting strict investigations. Citizens can directly report stores raising prices privately to the Fourth Division of the City Police Bureau, and they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3 id="e22">City Finance Bureau Streamlines Tax Collection <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Since Director Luo took office, the City Finance Bureau has been very active in adjusting the new finances. The internal structure has been completely refreshed. The newly established Supervisory Section is conducting a very strict investigation into the malpractices of merchants evading and leaking taxes. Illegal acts by financial administrative tax collection personnel are no longer seen. In addition to the adjusted consumption tax rate that has been implemented, the adjustment of business license fees and property donations, as well as the opening of business tax collection in the old No. 18 and No. 2 districts, have been approved by the municipal government and the Ministry of Finance and will be implemented in sequence. It is expected that the city's finances will improve in the future, and the unified collection and expenditure will tend to balance.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Gaoqiao District Collects Excess Land Tax; Requesting Municipal Government Correction; Special Commissioner Gong Wenhuan Has Been Sent to Investigate <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Pudong Native Place Association Councilor Zhong Yuliang submitted a proposal to the council regarding the overcollection of land tax in Gaoqiao District, which was passed by the council and submitted to the municipal government for correction. Special Commissioner Gong Wenhuan was sent to investigate. Councilor Zhong's proposal stated: "Land tax is a national tax and a basic element in guaranteeing people's property rights. Our people uphold the tradition of paying national taxes early, and paying land tax is a wealthy obligation. Unless there is extreme poverty or a year of famine, they will not deliberately delay payment and face punishment. In the event of natural disasters, war, or poor harvests, they must rely on wise officials to sympathize with the people's suffering, assess the autumn harvest, and reduce or exempt taxes to protect the people. Extra charges are strictly prohibited. According to the fixed rate of land tax in Shanghai Special Municipality in the 33rd year of the Republic, as announced by the Municipal Finance Bureau, the upper-grade land is taxed at 180 yuan per mu, and the lower-grade land is taxed at 151.2 yuan per mu. In addition, 150 yuan is collected for military police rice. These amounts are very clear. It has now been discovered that the actual collection situation in the Shangqiao District is that the upper-grade land is taxed at 600 yuan per mu, and the lower-grade land is taxed at 545 yuan per mu, which is very different from the fixed amount. If there are any additional collection fees, they should be announced in advance or marked on the voucher, so that they are clear. However, because these procedures are not available, people are concerned. When asked about the collection staff, they cannot explain in detail, and there may be extra fees. At a time when people's livelihoods are difficult, they cannot bear the burden. This Association is sincerely concerned about the local area and submits this proposal to the municipal government to investigate and correct the situation, in order to eliminate extra charges and alleviate the people's suffering."</p>
<h3 id="e24">Financial, Industrial, and Market Conditions in Shanghai This Past Week; "Haiti Bonds" and Others See Fierce Price Increases <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Financial, industrial, and market conditions in Shanghai in the past week have fluctuated sharply due to rumors about the European situation. General speculative funds have all shifted to "Haiti Bonds" and Russian imperial activities. Therefore, in the financial sector, the "Haiti Bonds" saw the most fierce price increases, with the highest peak exceeding the closing price of the black market before the big settlement by a huge margin. The surge in momentum on Wednesday and Thursday was shocking. Later, many bulls saw the opportunity to take profits and sell in large quantities, and sentiment weakened slightly, causing prices to fall. By Saturday, the price had fallen by more than nine points, but it was still more than 30% higher than the previous week. The rise in public bonds was not as weak as the "Haiti Bonds", but there were fewer buyers than the "Haiti Bonds", because people tend to buy gold as a good strategy. Although the Chinese stock market was buoyant due to loose monetary conditions and bull absorption, leading to a period of fierce price increases, only the popular stocks of Wing On Company, Wing On Textile Mill, and Mayer Silk Factory saw active trading. The general public views the stock market with indifference, and it is not yet the time to revitalize the stock market. Within the financial sector this week, due to the lingering customs of the Lunar New Year, each industry has not yet started to operate in a big way, so there is nothing to report. The daily interest rate for money changers remained unchanged at 65 cents, but the black market rate continued to rise. Regarding industry and commerce, factories in various industries are still unable to start production due to the lack of electricity, which affects the rise in prices. Fortunately, the Municipal Economic Bureau has taken emergency measures to suppress and stabilize prices, re-approving sixteen kinds, four of which are monopolized products, so they were not approved for public release. The new price limits for major commodities have been announced and implemented, and the Economic Police Bureau is assisting in the enforcement. As a result, price increases are prevented from escalating. However, on Friday and Saturday, rice prices rose again, and the wholesale prices of other daily necessities continued to rise. This has disappointed the expectations of the price suppression authorities and the general public. It is hoped that the economic enforcement authorities will not ignore this type of development, and quickly investigate and verify the root cause and enforce severe penalties in order to meet the purpose of stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>

<p>Boiled water sold in the city's boiled water shops has been raised without permission. The authorities then stipulated that the price should be 15 yuan per ladle. Recently, the boiled water shops have ignored the price limit and raised the price to 30 yuan per ladle without permission. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Citizens of This City Should Rapidly Build Air Raid Shelters: Police Bureau Deputy Director Xue Broadcasts <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Xue Zhiliang, Deputy Director of the Second Division of the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau, recently broadcast on Shanghai Radio the significance of citizens constructing air raid shelters. The gist of his message was:</p>
<p>Remarkable Effectiveness</p>
<p>Currently, the weakest point in the air defense posture is the slow construction of air raid shelters. An ancient saying goes, "Prevent trouble before it happens," and "Preparedness prevents misfortune." Now, in the face of bombing risks in Britain and Germany, the lives of ordinary citizens in major cities, as well as all vital institutions and factories, are generally secured underground, in what are called air raid shelters. The construction of air raid shelters is quite widespread in major cities in Japan. Although B-29 bombers have repeatedly attacked in recent times, the number of casualties has been minimal. Furthermore, according to the reports of personnel dispatched by this bureau to Hankou for on-site investigation, the enemy employed carpet bombing, yet the Japanese suffered no casualties. Upon investigation, the reason was the widespread use of air raid shelters, the remarkable effectiveness of which in protecting lives has been fully proven. Looking at the air raid shelters in Shanghai, they are indeed not very developed; this is a fact. Every family, all citizens, factories, banks, companies, shops, and all other public places in Shanghai must not leave anyone behind during air raids and must take shelter. We hope that all citizens will rapidly construct air raid shelters to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Construction Locations</p>
<p>The construction of air raid shelters requires selecting appropriate locations, and the construction methods need to be concrete. The materials should be simple and easy to obtain, and the coordination of construction tools must be consistent. However, despite various difficulties, in light of the air defense situation in Shanghai, it is necessary to overcome all obstacles and eliminate all difficulties. We have now entered a state of urgently building air raid shelters. The place of construction should first be selected near one's own residence as the standard, so that in the event of an air raid, one can reach the location most quickly and take shelter immediately. In general households, whether to set up air raid shelters outside or inside the house can be decided individually. That is, if there is suitable open space near the residence, it can also be used. Furthermore, in densely populated residential areas, if there is no suitable open space nearby, then choose a place in the house that is relatively strong and easy to take shelter in for construction. I think there are no obstacles, as long as you find the availability of suitable open space. If it is not suitable for construction inside the house, you can also choose public open space on the road. However, due to the presence of underground public gas pipes, water pipes, underground electrical wires, and other buried objects, it is necessary to request permission from the Municipal Government Works Bureau. The Municipal Government will definitely provide convenience for this request, so please do not hesitate to apply to the police substation under your jurisdiction at any time.</p>
<p>Construction Methods</p>
<p>Next, there are various different construction methods. In the current situation in Shanghai, dig underground to the extent that water does not seep in, and then pile soil on the ground, which is called a semi-underground style. The size depends on the number of people it can accommodate, with a maximum of fifteen people per shelter. Two entrances and exits must be set up, using strong wood, bamboo, laurel wood beams, and the exterior is piled with soil, covered with decks or mats, and then covered with soil and sand to a depth of one foot. There should be no bricks, tiles, or pebbles nearby to prevent the danger of shrapnel from anti-aircraft shells scattering into the soil and sand. Next, sturdy objects must be installed at both entrances to prevent blasts. Special attention must be paid to hygiene and preventing leaks inside. This is what the builder or manager needs to pay attention to on a regular basis. Whether there are any leaks in the shelter, whether the soil around the air raid shelter is strong or not, and whether there are bricks, tiles, and shrapnel nearby should be checked. If there are, they must be removed to prevent danger.</p>
<p>Building Cellars</p>
<p>Air raid cellars (basements) are used to store valuables, important items, and other necessary items to prevent fire. Underground cellars are extremely effective in preventing fires, as proven by many real-world examples. In experiments in Japan, the temperature inside a burning house reached very high Celsius temperatures. Inside a cellar 15 centimeters deep below ground in this house, the temperature was only around 20 degrees Celsius. Stored items such as ledgers, clothing, food, and even highly flammable volatile oils showed no abnormalities. During air raids or air defense activities, it is necessary to have a cellar to store important items to prevent danger and avoid worries. In case of emergency evacuation, it is impossible to carry valuables, important items, or daily necessities. To ensure the safety of the majority of evacuees, it is strictly forbidden to carry items. Therefore, each household must have a cellar to protect important items and store easily flammable and dangerous items inside.</p>
<p>Cellar Structure</p>
<p>Cellars can be set up indoors or outdoors. The size should be appropriate for storing items. The structure of the cellar is best made of reinforced concrete or bricks. If these are not available, wooden boxes, iron boxes, or discarded Western bathtubs can be used. Bury them underground, store valuables and food items inside, cover them well, and pile sand and soil on top to a thickness of 30 centimeters (about one foot). (Points to note) Prevent bricks and tiles from damaging the cellar due to the collapse of the building and excessive weight, and avoid hindering evacuation. Also, prevent water from entering the cellar and soaking the items inside. Be sure to quickly load the items into the cellar during evacuation, and the equipment must be complete. The above is a brief statement, and we hope that all citizens will follow it.</p>

<p>The table tennis charity match organized by students from San Yu Middle School in this city was held at Xi Qing yesterday at 2 p.m. He Ren ultimately defeated the entire Shanghai mixed team 4-1. In the final match, Hu Hun Chuan Qifang not only broke through Wang Changhou's first barrier but also lost to Wang Youxin, making the individual championship difficult to determine. In the first match, He Ren's Wang Changhou easily defeated Hu Hun's Li Zongpei in three straight sets. In the second match, Xue Xuchu encountered Hu Hun's Huang Zhijun. Huang took two games in a row, but Xue eventually came from behind with a score of 3-2. In the third match, Hu Hun's Chuan Qifang fought He Ren's Ouyang Wei. Ouyang Wei's stamina was insufficient, and Chuan eventually reversed the defeat with a score of 3-2. In the fourth match, Lu Hanjun met Wang Youxin, and the competition was fierce. Lu ultimately lost. In the overall score, He Ren held an absolute lead of 2-1. In the fifth match, He Ren's Zhou Kegang narrowly defeated Hu Hun's Zhang Fuwei 3-2. He Ren heavily defeated Hu Hun 4-1. The final match immediately began. The only player from Hu Hun who qualified was Chuan Qifang. Chuan first fought Wang Changhou, and Chuan overcame Wang Changhou with skillful technique with a score of 3-1. Next, Chuan fought Wang Youxin. Chuan was exhausted after a long battle and was defeated by Wang's skillful play, a great pity.</p>
