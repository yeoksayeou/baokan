<h3>首都產價維紀會輪廓（上）</h3>
<p>— 人平</p>
<p>在本年度首都最可矚目的驚人措施，就是爲安定民生而設立的「首都物資平價維紀委員會」了。當該會在一月二十七日發表成立的時候，京市的物價，就顯然地一致見疲，尤其主要的食米，雖然正常廢曆年關，竟從每石兩萬四千元一度下鴻至每石一萬七千元。</p>
<p>平價維紀的工作開展以後，一方面設法抑平物價，一方面整飭軍紀，大刀闊斧，雙管齊下，可謂政令如山，一時的囤積奸商，以及不法軍警，無不歛跡。委員長葉蓬的大膽作風，正造成了還都以來第一次切實解除民困的創舉。</p>
<p>訂定生活必需品七項</p>
<p>平耙會的使命，旣是要阻止物價的狂漲，所以特別訂定了首都市區生活必需物資七種－－米·柴草·鹽·油·菜·猪肉·鷄鴨（包括蛋）。爲了掃除所有的障害，就同時肅正軍警的風紀，除了負起暢通來源和抑平價格的責任而外，還訂立了對七項物資妨害供求關係的重刑，現在可以略艦如下；</p>
<p>（一）平價維紀委員會得適用「陸海空軍刑法」，「戰時刑事特別法」，「公務員犯贓治罪條例」，「刑法」等法。</p>
<p>（二）對於生活必需物資七種，以强暴脅迫詐術或他法妨害其供求關係，致市上發生缺乏者，以戰時軍令特准處以死刑。</p>
<p>（三）凡意圓不法利益，非法勒派捐款，或利用權勢，以强暴脅迫詐術，或他法勒取人民財物者，無論是吾爲公務員，均分別處死刑，無期徒刑，十年以上有期徒刑。</p>
<p>還有附帶的兩條：（一）機關團體或個人，不得向七項生活必需物炎之營業商索取規費，如違，受授同科嚴法懲治。（二）平價會人員，如有利用一時權勢與執行動務之機會，而貪污凟職，及違犯其他法紀者，更予盡法以懲。以上都由該會軍法組審判，呈准軍委會委員長執行。</p>
<p>組織和督察</p>
<p>該會在組織方面，會的下面，設有秘電室，點放，燃料，督察，軍法四組，分堂各項事務。工作人員都從各機關調用，是無給職，主任委員由陸軍部長兼任，起初是葉蓬，現在是蕭叔宣。委員由周市畏，李總監等，有關長官兼任。</p>
<p>工作最重要的，就是在於督察一項，所以又組織了督察大隊，每天在物資暢通或者有關的地帶，分區分項，嚴密督察，督察隊就是天天看見在篤路上疾駛的大卡車，上面站立了隊員。標着白底紅字的隊旗，有時查獲了不法軍警，就捉上卡車，載回去審問。這些督察隊員，也是向各機關部隊調用的人員混合而編成的。</p>
<p>該隊的工作，可稱始終在嚴密地進行之中，精神是相常可嘉的。據調查的數字，自二月一日起至二月二十六日止，除已槍決了勒索民財倚權欺詐的三要犯外，所查獲的不法違法軍民，已達二百零九名，其中經訊明案情輕微申斥釋放的有一百十七名，案情較重送軍法組收押訊辦的五十九名，現尙寄押在隊的三十三名。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰時民衆代表會議獻詞</h3>
<p>首都各界民衆代表建議召開各省市戰時民衆代表會議，已由政府接納，並定目明日起至三十日止連續舉行會議三天。各省市業已推派代表，赴京出席。我們願以熱忱敬祝該會議進行順利，成績圓滿。</p>
<p>戰時民衆代表會議的使命，我們認爲是各自發表對於國是與民生的見解以及改善的對策，經過討論，綜合作成切實易行的建議方案，貢獻政府採納施行，以期對於國是與民生兩有裨益。質直言之，必須解決爭取戰爭勝利的各種實際問題，而竭力避免一切戰時會議八股提案。</p>
<p>這次會議，顧名思義，應該使「戰時」與「民衆」聯繫起來。戰時當然以軍事爲第一，可是，同時不能忽略戰時政治與戰時經濟的配合軍事，才能有效保障爭取軍事勝利。戰時政治與戰時經濟的對象是民衆，就是如何從政治經濟的配合，而使民衆在戰時能自發的協力。這是政府歷來的最大課題。</p>
<p>我們在兩年以來，一貫主張中樞與各級地方政府設置民意機關。其目的就是希望從而使戰時政治與戰時經濟與民衆聯擊起來，也就是從而使政府與民衆聯繫起來打成一片，共同爭取戰爭勝利。這次會議可以說是政府與民衆聯繫的開端，所以，我們對此表示極端擁護。</p>
<p>現在社會上對於時局有兩種主張，一種是說，一切的一切應以戰爭爲前提，戰時政治與經濟都在其次，也就是只以軍事爲着眼點，其他一切都不及顧到。另一種是說，必須先行滿足人民對於政治的要求，解決人民最低限度的生活，才能更有效保障達到軍事勝利。我們認爲這兩種主張，目標完全相同，不過遝用手段不同而已。我們也一向主張目前應以軍事爲第一，但滿足人民政治要求，解決人民最低限度生活問題，必須兼　並願。無論偏於任何一方，便是戰時與民衆脫了節，如果這樣，那末要求軍事勝利，則事倍叻半了。</p>
<p>因此，希望這次會議中，如何使戰時與民衆聯緊起來？如何使人民與政府打成一片？如何確保戰爭最後勝利？如何使人民滿足最低限度的政治要求？解決最低限度的民生問題？對於這種種問題，得到圓滿的結論。</p>
<p>這次會議，我們認爲是政府聽取人民意見的開瑞，至於怎樣設圖經常的民意機關，希望在不久的將來從而促使實現。</p>
<p>盟邦日本最近閣議通過總武裝案，組織國民義勇隊，小磯首相勗勵國民，也說「防衛國土，不僅在執戈殺敵一途，即在軍需增產食糧增產及運輸等後方各種工作上亦應倍加努力，這與防衛國土上所獲之功效亦非同小可」。正是戰時政治與經濟配合軍事共同爭取勝利的具體說明。</p>
<p>十二日，南京各界民衆代表於戰時時局懇談會席上，曾決議召集全國民衆代表大會，當時即約請柬亞聯盟，新國民運動促進委員會，新民會等三團體積極協助，爲求其具體化而展開如火如茶的遝動。因爲這是由民間自動發起的民衆運動，所以我們認爲非常有意義。勿庸諱言，目前的時局非常嚴重，凡是稍微關心政治的中國人士，無不各在某稱不同意義上希望局面轉變，以求事態的解決。但誠實的中國人士，由於客觀形勢的過於嚴重，而趨向逃避的態度，這是不容否認的事實。然而此次舉動，如果眞是憂國人士自發之民衆運動的話，那末國府富局應當捉住這個最好機會，以求民意的暢達。宣傳部長趙尊嶽氏，滿腔熱心，表現蒲憂國至誠，曾發表談話，認爲該會將有極六供獻，所以他對該運動極表同情而且充分暸解。我們也不得不熱望這一自發的民衆運動，取得三團體的積極援助，而收獲充分的成果。但如眞求其成功，則必須尊重該會是由於民衆本身自發而召集的這一點，同時也應着重指出，對於該會的人事及討論內容，官方不宜橫加干涉或指導。再者，該會旣是憂國至誠所流露出來的結晶，那末縱然間或發出國府常局所不願聽的言語來，自然政府也應當表示寬宏大量，不宜採取反對或報復立塲。假如該會只是起草一篇冠免堂皇的宣言文章來作收塲，那末該會的召集，就失掉了所有的意義。該運動的發起人以及國府常局應當注意這一點。</p>
<p>同時該會未來決定的各種議案，政府應常充分加以尊重，凡是具有可能實行者，應有誠意立刻付諸實施。固然民衆大會的決定，對於政府的政策，不能有直接的拘束力。但其決定和建議，是眞正反映民衆迫切的要求，所以凡是可能實行者，應大刀闊斧，不容躊躇地當作政府施策來採用，如是方能民意暢達。假如民衆大會無論有如何的適當決定，但結果不能反映於實際政治的領域裏，這就等於費盡心血發動起來的民衆運動，又受到了當頭棒竭，因而民衆大失所望，又使民衆返歸不關心政治的消極態度上去。因此，我們不能不希望國府當局對於這一點，應當善回處理。</p>
<p>重慶政權因爲屈服於共產黨的政治撃和美國的內政干涉，在今年秋天準備召集國民大的南京國民政府，也在還都宣言中曾經闡明，實現和平及實施憲政乃國府的最大任務，後來甚至曾努力於憲政實施委員會的工作。然而目前環境可以坦白承認者，即草率實行憲政，結局則會陷於權端形工主義的泥沼裏，進而會流於欺騙民衆的把戲裏。如果這個意見是對的，那末實施憲政這類政治大問題，是需要充分周到的準備，和等待客觀條件成熟的，所以目前還是追求其他某種適常的民意暢達手段，爲更切實際，爲更賢明。在這一點上，國府當局應當充分尊重全國大會，同時應當承認，該會具有把握民衆的利用價值。（林譯自三月十六日大陸新報社評）</p>

<h3>各業脫貨求現　物價回跌</h3>
<p>本市各業市塲商品及原料，邇來粉紛陳列求售，減價削碉者比比皆是，誠爲近數年來未有之記錄。惟供過於求，各業雖希望脫貨求現，終以市民購買力薄弱，營業仍極淸澹，此種現象尤足充分表示囤貨完全出籠，市塲物價已止漲回跌。據金融工商兩界人士稱：上海商品價格一致趨跌，當係市政當局嚴查物價爲其主因，外埠水陸交通欠暢爲其副因，預料從今以後，百物價格將有繼續下跌之趨勢。並悉本市各工廠公司商號，對於各往來銀行錢莊之借款，不論數額之鉅細，業經分別提前償還，行莊收回此種工商業往來放款，大致約佔放出總額百分之八十。蓋各業以行莊借款利息雖微，然現在購存貨品已少漲價之希望，與其借款付息，不若脫貨求現，償淸負債部份，比較穩定。</p>

<h3>簡訊</h3>
<p>周璇歌唱會銀壇歌后周璇，將於廿九日起日夜在金都大戲院舉行歌唱大會三天，節目包括「鳳凰于飛」，「漁家女」，「鸞鳳和鳴」等曲，由上海交響樂團伴奏，金玉谷指揮，此外並有影星嚴俊·關宏達及音樂家奏　　等，參加精彩節目。</p>
<h3>李天鐸女士　獨唱音樂會前奏</h3>
<p>著名女高音李天鐸女士，將於本月三十一日下午五時正在美琪大戲院舉行　唱音樂會。李女士是國立音專　樂科的高才生，同舒希林敎授受業六七年之久。由去年夏天起，又從名指揮拍　，力圖深造，並與孚爾夫人朝夕講求發音之調整及音色之美化等技巧。凡是領略過李女士的歌聲的人，無不稱贊她音量的寬宏，而認爲那是她獨有的秉賦　造詣，這種音量再加上她那圓融的音色的潤澤，便成功了一種理想的人才。</p>
<p>這一次爲了增强伴奏的效能，特將上海交響樂隊由　有人數增至六十人，這樣大規模的樂隊是前未曾有的，但這對於李女士的歌喉，却可以說是恰好相稱的。擔任指揮的是馬戈林斯基敎授，他對於歌唱伴奏獨到的研究與心得，是久爲大衆所賞識的。這次音樂會的節目，不愧爲莊嚴偉大，大作曲家如：莫柴·裴才·馬加尼·華格　·凡第·波西尼等之作品，俱被　入，而李女士的獨唱全部都是極名貴精湛的歌曲，這種艱重的節目，　來只有李女士敢於嘗試。</p>
<p>近來因爲大規　音樂會的缺乏，音樂空氣，日趨沉悶，李女士的音樂會在這期間以堅毅的精神大規模的舉行，正可以適應音樂愛好者的迫切需要。</p>

<h3>The Parliament Solemnly Holds Closing Ceremony; Japanese Prime Minister Delivers Speech; Clarifying Unwavering Stance on Completing the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – The closing ceremony of the 86th Japanese Parliament was solemnly held at 11:00 AM on the 26th in the plenary hall of the House of Peers.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a speech at the closing ceremony of the Parliament on the 26th, as follows: During this Parliament session, the government has straightforwardly elucidated the actual state of the Empire’s constant and present crisis, as well as various internal and external situations. At this critical juncture for the rise and fall of the Empire, we have specifically laid bare our determination to break through this extraordinary difficult situation, along with the fundamental principles and concrete outlines of our policies, in order to inspire and gain the cooperation of the people. At the same time, we have clarified to both domestic and international audiences the unwavering stance of the Empire regarding the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Members of Parliament, driven by profound patriotic sentiments, have frankly engaged in fervent discussions and have further urged the government to decisively implement active and resolute policies for achieving victory. In the face of this increasingly urgent war, their vigorous spirit of certain victory is truly noteworthy. This Parliament, with national unity, is resolutely advancing toward the path of achieving victory, and the determination of the hundred million is extremely high. The government, having had the budget and various legal bills resolved, will strive to implement them. At the same time, the important policies declared in the Parliament will also be rapidly implemented, and the total power of the hundred million will be mobilized to achieve the completion of national defense and the enhancement of war capabilities. Now that Iwo Jima has unfortunately fallen into enemy hands, and enemy air raids on the mainland are gradually intensifying, the mainland becoming a battlefield is a possibility. As the situation becomes increasingly tense, I hope that the people will further maintain the spirit of protecting the national essence and fulfill their duties as shields protecting the Empire. I hope that all the people will unite and strive to fulfill the responsibilities of completing production and defending the rear, with military officers and civilians integrated as one, advancing on the path of certain victory.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, in a speech to the House of Peers on the 25th, responded to Viscount Kawase Naoko's request for "swift implementation of decisive war policies," stating as follows: Most of what can be clarified is being gradually implemented. The government is exerting all its strength to implement the necessary victory policies, and in the future, there is also a determination to shed blood with military force.</p>

<h3>An Outline of the Capital Price Maintenance Committee (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ren Ping</p>
<p>The most noteworthy and surprising measure in the capital this year is the establishment of the "Capital Commodity Price Maintenance Committee" to stabilize people's livelihoods. When the committee announced its establishment on January 27th, commodity prices in Nanjing immediately showed a unified downward trend. In particular, the price of rice, the main staple food, surprisingly dropped from 24,000 yuan per shi to 17,000 yuan per shi, despite the normal time for the Lunar New Year holidays.</p>
<p>After the launch of the price maintenance work, the committee simultaneously sought to suppress commodity prices and rectify military discipline, wielding a big stick with both hands. The government orders were like mountains, and for a time, hoarding merchants and illegal military police disappeared. Committee Chairman Ye Peng's bold style is creating the first genuine initiative since the return of the capital to effectively relieve the people's suffering.</p>
<p>Seven Essential Items for Daily Life Determined</p>
<p>The mission of the Price Maintenance Committee is to prevent the soaring of commodity prices. Therefore, it has specifically determined seven essential commodities for daily life in the capital: rice, firewood, salt, oil, vegetables, pork, and poultry (including eggs). To eliminate all obstacles, it simultaneously rectified the discipline of the military police. In addition to assuming the responsibility of unblocking sources and suppressing prices, it also established severe penalties for obstructing the supply and demand of the seven commodities. A brief summary is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Price Maintenance Committee may apply the "Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law," the "Wartime Criminal Special Law," the "Regulations on Punishing Embezzlement by Public Officials," and the "Criminal Law."</p>
<p>(2) For the seven essential commodities for daily life, those who use violence, coercion, fraud, or other methods to obstruct their supply and demand, resulting in shortages in the market, shall be punished with the death penalty as specially approved by wartime military orders.</p>
<p>(3) Those who seek illegal profits, illegally levy donations, or use their power to extract wealth from the people by violence, coercion, fraud, or other means, whether they are public officials or not, shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than ten years.</p>
<p>There are also two additional provisions: (1) Organizations, groups, or individuals shall not solicit fees from merchants engaged in the seven essential commodities for daily life. Violators shall be severely punished equally. (2) If Price Maintenance Committee personnel abuse their temporary power and the opportunity to perform their duties to engage in corruption, dereliction of duty, or violation of other laws and regulations, they shall be punished to the fullest extent of the law. All of the above shall be adjudicated by the committee's military law team and submitted to the chairman of the Military Affairs Commission for execution.</p>
<p>Organization and Supervision</p>
<p>In terms of organization, the committee has a secretariat, dispatch office, fuel group, supervisory group, and military law group. All staff members are seconded from various agencies and are unpaid. The chairman of the committee is concurrently held by the Minister of the Army. Initially, it was Ye Peng, and now it is Xiao Shuxuan. The members are concurrently held by Mayor Zhou, General Supervisor Li, and other relevant officials.</p>
<p>The most important work lies in supervision. Therefore, a supervisory brigade was organized. Every day, in areas where goods are circulating or related areas, the brigade conducts strict supervision by district and item. The supervisory teams can be seen speeding along the roads in large trucks with team members standing on them. The team flag, marked with white letters on a red background, is visible. Sometimes, illegal military police are discovered, and they are taken to the truck and brought back for questioning. These supervisory team members are also a mix of personnel seconded from various agencies and troops.</p>
<p>The team's work can be said to be consistently rigorous, and their spirit is commendable. According to the investigated figures, from February 1st to February 26th, in addition to the three major offenders who were executed for extorting money from the people and engaging in fraud, 209 illegal or law-breaking military personnel and civilians have been investigated. Among them, 117 were released after interrogation revealed minor circumstances and were given a reprimand. Fifty-nine, whose cases were more serious, were sent to the military law group for detention and investigation. Currently, 33 are still detained in the team.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Word of Contribution to the Wartime People's Representative Conference</h3>
<p>The suggestion from representatives of various sectors of the capital to convene a wartime People's Representative Conference for all provinces and cities has been accepted by the government, and the conference is scheduled to be held for three consecutive days, from tomorrow to the 30th. All provinces and cities have dispatched representatives to Nanjing to attend. We would like to express our sincere wishes for the smooth progress and successful outcome of the conference.</p>
<p>We believe that the mission of the wartime People's Representative Conference is for each representative to express their views on national affairs and people's livelihoods, as well as their ideas for improvement. Through discussion, these views should be synthesized into practical and feasible recommendations for the government to adopt and implement, in order to benefit both national affairs and people's livelihoods. To put it bluntly, the conference must resolve various practical issues related to winning the war and strive to avoid all cliché proposals common in wartime conferences.</p>
<p>This conference, as its name suggests, should link "wartime" and "the people." During wartime, military affairs are undoubtedly paramount. However, at the same time, the coordination of wartime politics and wartime economy with military affairs cannot be ignored, as it is necessary to effectively guarantee the achievement of military victory. The target of wartime politics and wartime economy is the people, which means how to achieve the spontaneous cooperation of the people during wartime through the coordination of politics and economy. This has always been the biggest challenge for the government.</p>
<p>For the past two years, we have consistently advocated the establishment of public opinion organs in the central and local governments at all levels. The purpose is to link wartime politics and wartime economy with the people, and thus to link the government with the people to work together to win the war. This conference can be said to be the beginning of the government's connection with the people, so we express our extreme support for it.</p>
<p>Currently, there are two viewpoints in society regarding the current situation. One viewpoint is that everything should be based on the war, with wartime politics and economics being secondary. In other words, only military affairs should be the focus, and everything else should be neglected. The other viewpoint is that the people's demands for politics must be met first, and the people's minimum living conditions must be resolved before military victory can be effectively guaranteed. We believe that these two viewpoints have the same goal, but the means used are different. We have always advocated that military affairs should be paramount at present, but meeting the people's political demands and resolving the people's minimum living conditions must also be done concurrently. Leaning toward either side would disconnect wartime from the people. If this happens, then the effort to achieve military victory will be doubled with half the results.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that this conference will address how to link wartime and the people closely, how to unite the people and the government, how to ensure the final victory of the war, and how to meet the people's minimum political demands and resolve their minimum livelihood problems, and reach satisfactory conclusions on these issues.</p>
<p>We believe that this conference is the government's initial effort to listen to the people's opinions. As for how to establish permanent public opinion organs, we hope to promote their realization in the near future.</p>
<p>Japan, an allied nation, recently passed a general mobilization plan in its cabinet and organized a national volunteer corps. Prime Minister Koiso encouraged the people, saying, "Defending the country is not only about taking up arms and killing the enemy, but also about redoubling our efforts in various rear-area tasks such as increasing military supplies, increasing food production, and transportation. The effectiveness of this is no less than that of defending the country." This is a concrete explanation of how wartime politics and economics coordinate with military affairs to jointly achieve victory.</p>
<p>On the 12th, representatives of various sectors of the Nanjing people, at a wartime situation discussion meeting, resolved to convene a national People's Representative Congress. At that time, the East Asia League, the New National Movement Promotion Committee, and the New People's Society were invited to actively assist in order to materialize the movement. Because this is a people's movement initiated by the people themselves, we believe it is very meaningful. It is undeniable that the current situation is very serious. All Chinese people who are slightly concerned about politics hope for a change in the situation in some different sense in order to resolve the situation. However, honest Chinese people are tending to avoid the attitude because the objective situation is too serious. However, if this move is truly a patriotic people's movement initiated by patriotic people, then the national government should seize this best opportunity to seek the free expression of public opinion. Propaganda Minister Zhao Zunyue, with a heart full of enthusiasm, expressed his patriotic sincerity and said that he believed that the conference would make extremely great contributions. Therefore, he expressed his sympathy and full understanding of the movement. We also cannot but hope that this spontaneous people's movement will receive the active assistance of the three organizations and achieve full results. But to truly achieve success, it is necessary to respect the fact that the conference was convened by the people themselves. At the same time, it should also be emphasized that the government should not interfere or guide the personnel and discussion content of the conference. Furthermore, since the conference is the crystallization of patriotic sincerity, then even if it occasionally utters words that the national government does not want to hear, the government should naturally show generosity and should not take an opposing or retaliatory stance. If the conference only drafts a grand declaration and ends the meeting, then the convening of the conference will have lost all meaning. The initiators of the movement and the national government should pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government should always fully respect the various resolutions decided by the conference in the future. Anything that is possible to implement should be implemented immediately in good faith. Of course, the decisions of the People's Congress cannot have direct binding force on the government's policies. But its decisions and recommendations truly reflect the urgent demands of the people. Therefore, anything that is possible to implement should be adopted as government policies with boldness and without hesitation. Only in this way can public opinion be fully expressed. If the People's Congress, no matter how appropriate the decisions, cannot be reflected in the actual political sphere, then this is equivalent to the people's movement, which was launched with painstaking efforts, being hit with a head-on blow, causing great disappointment to the people and causing them to return to a passive attitude of not caring about politics. Therefore, we cannot but hope that the national government will properly handle this point.</p>
<p>Because the Chongqing regime succumbed to the political attacks of the Communist Party and the domestic interference of the United States, it is preparing to convene the National Assembly this autumn. The Nanjing National Government also clarified in its return-to-capital declaration that realizing peace and implementing constitutional government are the government's greatest tasks. Later, it even worked hard on the work of the Constitutional Implementation Committee. However, in the current environment, what can be admitted frankly is that hastily implementing constitutional government will end up in the quagmire of formalistic formalism and will even lead to a trick to deceive the people. If this view is correct, then major political issues such as the implementation of constitutional government require full and thorough preparation and waiting for objective conditions to mature. Therefore, it is more practical and wiser to pursue other appropriate means of freely expressing public opinion at present. On this point, the national government should fully respect the National Congress and at the same time should admit that the conference has the utilization value of grasping the people.

<h3>Various Industries Selling Off Goods for Cash – Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Recently, commodities and raw materials in various industries and markets in the city have been displayed for sale in large quantities, with price reductions and discounts seen everywhere. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in recent years. However, due to supply exceeding demand, although various industries hope to sell goods for cash, business remains very sluggish due to the weak purchasing power of citizens. This phenomenon fully indicates that hoarded goods have been completely released, and market prices have stopped rising and started to fall. According to figures in the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors, the consistent decline in commodity prices in Shanghai is mainly due to the municipal authorities' strict investigation of prices, and secondarily due to the poor water and land transportation to other areas. It is expected that from now on, the prices of all goods will continue to decline. It is also understood that various factories, companies, and shops in the city have been repaying their loans to various banks and money shops in advance, regardless of the amount. Generally, the amount of these industrial and commercial loans recovered by banks and money shops accounts for about 80% of the total amount lent. This is because the various industries believe that there is little hope of price increases for purchased goods, and it is more stable to sell goods for cash to repay debts than to borrow money and pay interest.</p>
<h3>University Students Crime Prevention Research Association – Preparing to Organize Speech Competition</h3>

<p>In order to enhance the effectiveness of the accompaniment, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra has been increased from its original number to sixty members.

<h3>Students Most Forceful in Donating to Charity School – Eagerly Awaiting Support from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Donations of Money and Books Equally Welcome Huaguang Voluntary Primary School has been running voluntary education for three semesters with remarkable results. This newspaper recently co-organized a voluntary elementary school, and the teachers and students of the school enthusiastically supported it because of their shared interests. A few days ago, all the students of the school donated money for voluntary student aid. Yesterday, the faculty and staff of the school raised more than 40,000 yuan, which is commendable. They also sent a letter expressing their enthusiasm, stating: "Huaguang Voluntary School, located at 284 Taikang Road, was founded in the second semester of 1943 by enthusiastic educators. It currently has more than 400 students, divided into ten grades, organized into two parts, with tuition and book fees all waived. There are more than ten faculty and staff members, with equal emphasis on teaching and training. Because it is necessary to cooperate with the school board in providing porridge, clothing, medical care, and medicine, special attention is paid to family visits. Since its establishment, it has been in its third semester. We, the faculty and staff of the school, have been interested in voluntary education for a long time, so we have been trying our best to achieve results; however, our abilities are weak and our experience is limited, so we cannot have full development. Since reading your newspaper's initiative to establish ten voluntary elementary schools, as well as Xie Lilin's advocacy of the 'Voluntary School Fund,' and the enthusiastic response from all parties, we are very excited and believe that your newspaper's initiative is promoting the strength of the entire society and is the initial creation of the entire voluntary education, which will surely be supported by people from all walks of life, and its results can be expected. As for the management regulations, they will be as perfect as possible, not only will Huaguang Voluntary School have rules to follow, but we will also be happy to have like-minded people, hoping to learn from each other and work together to seek new development for the future of voluntary education and popularize national education, which has profound significance. Because our economic abilities are weak, we have to do our best to solicit donations from outside. We have raised a total of 44,500 yuan in stored currency, and we have attached a list of donors. Please publish it separately to show credibility." (The names and amounts of donors will be listed in the donation advertisement)</p>
<p>Donations from Lost and Found Transferred to Charity School</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Qiuchao wrote: "I am writing to inform you that I found a passbook from a bank and two checks on the road. Later, I learned that they belonged to Xingsheng Grain Shop, so I telegraphed the shop. The manager, Mr. Chen Yunzhang, kindly offered me 3,000 yuan as a reward. Because I believe in the ancient saying that it is wrong to take what is not yours, I dare not accept it. I thought that the voluntary school run by your newspaper is in urgent need of donations, so I will transfer Mr. Chen's donation to the 'Voluntary School Fund' to create good fortune for Mr. Chen."</p>
<p>Teachers and Students Work Together to Donate Money and Books</p>
<p>All the children in the fourth grade of the Private Yisheng Elementary School wrote: "During today's commemorative week, our class teacher, Bo Guangsheng, reported on the news of your newspaper establishing a voluntary elementary school and Mr. Xie Lilin's initiative to create a voluntary school fund. We were all very excited when we heard this, so we also wanted to do our small part to help your newspaper complete this great act of righteousness. However, most of the parents of the children in our grade are vendors, and their families are very difficult, so our children are very frugal and do not have pocket money on a daily basis. Only a small number of children eat snacks in the morning, so only the children who eat snacks in the morning can save some money to donate to the 'Voluntary School Fund.' However, we spent a morning and only raised 400 yuan. We felt that this amount was too small, so we asked Mr. Bo to donate a little as well. He donated 600 yuan, combining it into 1,000 yuan. In addition, there are 1,400 yuan in candy money saved by other children, and a list is attached separately. Please publish it in your newspaper to show credibility. Although the amount we donated is very small, like a drop in the bucket, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will respond together, so the amount of donations will definitely be considerable in the future! In addition, we are offering 20 elementary school textbooks, hoping that you will accept them as textbooks for the voluntary elementary school."</p>
<p>All the students of the Private Daye Chengyu Elementary School wrote: "Recently, your newspaper is running voluntary elementary schools to rescue out-of-school children. We sympathize very much and are willing to do our part to help. Now we are sending you a total of 16,555 yuan, which is the snack money we have saved for a few days, and 584 old textbooks that we have collected, as well as 7,000 yuan that student Chen Xiufang has enthusiastically solicited (3,000 yuan each from Miss Wu Zhijing and Mr. Cheng Yunlong, 1,000 yuan from Miss Chen Nanxin, 4,000 yuan from Yuan Jinshan (donated by Mr. Yuan Qiqing), 2,000 yuan from Chen Qinzhun (donated by Mr. Chen Renli), and 1,000 yuan from Pang Meizhen (donated by Mr. Pang Qing), for a total of 30,555 yuan), please deposit it under the "Voluntary School Fund."</p>
<p>We are all children and know that our strength is small, but in order to help relieve the suffering of out-of-school children and respond to the enthusiasm of your newspaper, we are widely soliciting donations from our relatives. We hope that like Chen Yuan and other students, they will also come to help this cause!"</p>
<h3>Chinese Health Association Extends Examination Time</h3>
<p>Today marks the centenary of the birth of Wilhelm Röntgen, the founder of X-rays. All sectors of the city are holding a Tuberculosis Prevention Week, hoping to curb the spread of this terrible disease through universal examination methods, which is of great significance. The Chinese Health Association at 996 Jing'an Temple Road in this city has been working hard to provide health examinations for citizens, and in commemoration of this great inventor, it has expanded the examination time. From today, examinations will be conducted all day in the morning and afternoon (only in the morning on Sundays) until the end of this month, and only half the fee will be charged. These preferential examination coupons are now being sold by this office at a half price of 700 yuan per coupon. We hope that all sectors will not miss this opportunity.</p>
