<h3>馬歇爾昨離滬抵京　主席夫婦機塲迎迓</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕於前日下午抵滬之馬歇爾元帥，昨日下午二時，與魏德邁將軍同機飛往南京，晋謁　蔣主席。馬氏離滬前數小時，曾與此間各美軍首要，在建設大厦美軍總部，作重要會議。馬氏在滬前後逗留共廿四小時，離滬時，此間四川路至江灣路，以及江灣機塲四五英里以內，均臨時　嚴，由中美憲兵守衛。馬氏抵滬後，此間美軍均對彼寄以莫大之期望，有某美軍官祝曰：「願中國平安無事，願美國平安無事。」　〔本報訊〕錢市長大鈞，於昨日下午，陪同美駐華大使馬歇爾將軍及何總長應欽，飛京謁主席商談一切。開市長於日內即將返滬。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕蔣主席夫婦，今日於馬歇爾特使所乘飛機甫行降落機塲之際，乘黑轎車悄然蒞止，坐於車內，當時歡迎人員及攝影記者，均注視馬帥飛機之艙口。氏下機與歡迎人員握手及被記者包圍中時，參軍長商震突然高聲謂「蔣主席至矣」，馬帥聞之大感興奮，疾步走向主席坐車，將近，主席乃下車與馬帥握手，並操華語連聲日「好好好」馬帥當對主席盛意，表示深切感謝，並祝珍重。機塲警備係由四卡車衛衛士祖任。馬帥飛機未到前，美空軍曾在瞭望台注意收聽情報，頗現緊張，迨飛機到後，均愉快輕鬆矣。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕馬歇爾特使或將於明日與蔣主席同赴重慶。據悉：馬氏在渝之辦公處將設於美國大使館內，其行館將爲魏德邁將軍之故居嘉陵新村十四號，上述兩處相距彌近，均座落半山中，可俯瞰嘉陵江，風景至爲佳麗。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕主席行轅今日下午舉行茶會，歷時五十分鐘，主人蔣主席夫婦及貴賀馬歇爾元帥，魏德邁將軍，勞勃生代辦等以外，被邀參加者有何總司令，王部長，商參軍長，張參事平羣等，蔣主席首對馬帥表示歡迎之意，略謂，戰事結束前，即盼馬帥能於戰後來華一行，今日果惠然蒞止，可謂如願以償。嗣由馬帥答詞致謝，並申述中美兩國之友誼。</p>
<h3>在滬有重要會談　今日或將與主席同赴重慶</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕馬歇爾特使昨日離滬前，曾於晨間九時許，至美軍總部召開重要會議，聽取谷美軍長官之報告，至午方散。前晚馬歇爾特使與魏德邁將軍，曾單獨有兩小時以上之會談。　〔聯合社上海二十一日訊〕美國駐華特使馬歇爾將軍昨日抵滬，席不暇暖，即於今晨飛往甫京，會見蔣主席，並推行其促成中國全面和平之使命。而全中國以及東方大部份人民，咸正殷切期待此美國戰時名將能使各派息爭，共使遠東最大民族走上復興團結與富强大道。馬氏啓節後，各國訪員及攝影員約三十餘人，共乘一機尾隨而行。及至京中，蔣主席夫婦適於日前自北平紛擾核心蒞止，候與馬氏一晤。上海方面對此五星大將歡迎情緒，仍有餘音未絕之概。馬氏目覩上海默衆夾道相迎，歡呼遊行，雖深受感動，但對於所負重任，似覺駕輕就熟。渠在華懋飯店招待會上，與軍政商學報各界領袖談笑風生，的三小時而不倦，休憇一宿，今晨精神飽　，惟不願一吐胸中抱負，僅謂「目下尚無可言之事。」遙矚華北戰事沉寂，國眾遲遲開入瀋陽，取謂至少一部份與馬氏此行有關。蓋以爭執各方，咸在「踏步」靜觀馬氏此行有何貢獻。適於此時，中國方面美軍總司令魏德邁將軍，向部屬特別廣播，謂美軍駐華時期將較預定者爲長，與馬氏到滬先後巧合，彼此是否具有關係，雖不得而知，但各方予以重視，要可斷言。同時美軍行伍中反響則爲「我人在此須待戰爭結束，國內次不致於派遣馬歇爾其人者，僅爲安排我人回家。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京二十一電〕在頻傳華北國共衝突又轉激烈聲中，蔣主席與馬歇爾將軍之歷史性會議，今晚在此間開幕。中美兩方爲覓得解次中國內爭之方案，對於此次會商結果，均寄以期待。此外，留華美軍之數量與時期，以及國民政府能自美國獲得軍事與經濟援助之範圍，均爲尚待解次之問題。衆信中國方面欲與馬歇爾將軍討論之首要問題，爲將更多之軍隊運赴北方。</p>
<h3>陳紹寬談　海軍建設</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二十日電〕海軍總司令陳紹寬上將，本日除應記者請，說明海軍對抗戰中之貢獻外，並答覆詢問如下：關於中國海軍建設，陳氏稱：戰前我海軍有六十萬噸，今後倍之，或且不够，我已列爲四强之一，今後海軍總噸位，自應擔負世界海軍四分之一的責任。爲維持沿海治安，其初步當需巡洋艦，驅逐艦。太平洋戰事爆發後，美國於兩三年內，造艦噸位之多，四倍於英國，鑒於美國之經騐，將來造艦，訓練人才，爲時均速，美國戰時助我，今後自更歡迎其協助也。關於海軍敎育問題，陳氏稱：海軍學校現在重慶，有學生二百餘人，現値期考，加以川江水低，故尚未東遷，校址正在京滬勘覓，海軍學生五年畢業，並須登艦訓練兩年，將來海校當配合我海軍，而加以擴充。又我國派赴美國研習海軍者有一千人，赴英接收艦隻者二百人，預備前往者尚有八百人。陳氏並解答此次收容改編僞海軍僅數十人，至於截國海軍官兵，現僅三萬，其中並無英美顧問。陳氏對造艦問題，盼能自造，惟仍盼盟邦多予助力，並指出現代海軍必需擁有航空母艦，渠對海軍建設頗表樂觀，有以時間詢者，陳答曰：果有決心建設海軍，二年足矣。</p>

<h3>增復員建國收入　明年徵五項統稅　　出口貨亦將酌收檢驗費</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿一日電〕據悉，稅務當局爲增加復員建國之收入，擬於三十五年度開辦下列各項貨物之統稅：（一）麵粉，（二）茶葉，（三）水泥，（四）皮毛，（五）錫箔及迷信紙類，其預算數字聞已列入明年度預算之內，關於實施計劃，刻正在擬具中。</p>

<p>〔合衆社北平二十日電〕據接近蔣主席方面人士稱：主席似不願接受美國任何直接之援助以對付共黨，蓋認爲如此將引起對蘇之戰事。渠等相信國民政府當能不藉外力而對付共黨。據稱：蔣主席對共產黨方面之要求，除統一軍隊之管理問題外，已準備接受，蓋主席堅持中國祗有一個軍隊，而共黨方而亦不願放棄共軍隊之管理權。中立觀察家力贊杜魯門總統對華政策之文告，並指出最近美國之聲明，實爲歷來勸告國民黨與共黨息爭之結晶，但因共黨態度之頑固，致雙方意見不得和平解決。</p>
<h3>平市應興應革諸端　蔣主席指示周詳　拍賣日偽資產發展市政</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平二十一日電〕蔣主席蒞臨北平後，對於一般接收復員工作，均有指示，尤其關於敵僞工廠復工問題，曾手令市府限於三日內擬妥計劃，積極準備復工。據悉，市府公用局方面，已將此項計劃擬妥，將已接收之工廠按其設備。原料。所需資金情形分爲可即復工者，損毀過重，須要標價售賣者與無復工價値者等，製成表格，送請敵僞產業管理局核示。</p>
<p>〔又電〕蔣主席此次蒞平，除對華北軍政聽取報告指示機宜外，曾親赴各機關及重要名勝區域詳加巡視，凡應興應革各端，大者如市政建設，小者如街道淸潔，均就觀感所及，隨時指示主管切實注意。十二日上午赴中南海北平行營視察，即登景山遊覽。十三日上午遊覽故宮，巡視故宮博物館及古物陳列所，在宮內絳雪軒午餐。十四日上午赴西山碧雲寺，參謁總理衣冠塚，正午視察十一戰區長官部，下午視察市政府。十八日晨視察省市黨部。靑年團。</p>
<p>關於市政建設方面　主席聽取李主任。熊市長報告，以經費無着，不能從事建設，主席特手令各接收特派員，將接收及查獲之日偽資產，於拍賣後，提出百分之二十，撥歸市府，專作建築之用，以後續有發現之敵偽物資，亦撥交市府發展市政。</p>
<p>關於交通方面　主席令戰時運輸局撥給市府汽車百餘輛，改為公共汽車，以利市民交通。關於公敎人員生活方面，主席以市府公敎警察人員待遇徵薄，生活困苦，令飭市府及糧食主管人員，照舊配給食糧至明年二月份止。主席巡視名勝壇廟之後，曾分別指示整理改革，例如各增廟有陳列中國古代樂器者，主席虞其年久失傳，特令主管機關加派靑年協助管理，又如中南北三海之內，原有員工住宅或少數市民租屋，主席以其有礙觀瞻，難保整潔，令飭分別遷出。各公共遊覽塲所及名勝古蹟區械，多有茶座設備，以供遊人憇息，然因陋就簡，均不淸潔，主席令飭主管加以整頓。</p>
<p>關於市容方面　主席手令市府各街衢之棚戶，行人便道之攤販，城門甕洞內之商館，旣礙交通，亦妨觀瞻，均須限期遷除，重要街衢之標準鐘，原爲便利市民，其能修理使用者，應迅速修理，其不能修復者，應即拆除。主席在平八日，對於平市各方面，處處關切，無微不至，整個華北過去十餘年間，在敵人控制壓迫榨取蹂躪之下，本已暮氣沉沉，毫無生趣，古所謂燕趙多慷慨悲歌之士者，就三月來在平市各階層所接觸，實少此種象徵，鞠躬俯首唯諾奉行之現象，則隨處可見。</p>
<p>主席此次之蒞臨，在精神上無異予華北人民以强心劑，恢復其自信心，在各方面確有欣欣向榮之氣象，收穫之大，實非言語所能形容，亦非數字所能統計也。</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶廿一日電〕據悉，經濟部爲獎勵並扶植抗戰期中，後方從事生產工作具有成績之廠家，擬將接收之若干敵僞工廠除指由國家經營者外，餘則分配民營，此項原則業經擬定呈核，內容大致爲凡內遷工廠，其在抗戰期中從事生產工作，對抗戰確有貢獻，並曾遭受戰爭損失者，有請求優先分配之權。</p>
<h3>麥克納明日返菲　昨在滬對記者發表談話主張中菲力謀經濟聯繫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美駐菲高級專員麥克納，擬明日離滬返菲，昨日下午麥氏在招待記者席上强調聲稱：中菲在商業及經濟上之關係，應有進一步之聯繋。余此次來滬，係欲借此機會與中國社會領袖商討關於中。菲商業及經濟上之各項問題。滬地工商金融界，在戰前投資於菲列濱事業者甚多，余甚希望此項投資仍能繼續。余並期菲列濱能成爲中美商業上之交換中心點。在菲人士對中國皆感有極大興趣，在菲經商之華僑有十萬餘人，各種零售商業十分之八九皆由華僑經營，在菲之中國僑民皆動儉克苦，過去菲人對華僑商人甚多歧視，均有政治領袖對所謂「華人之勢力」多方抨擊。余欲聲明對於此種種族觀念余甚爲反對，在民生主義下，此種「菲島應屬於菲人」之主張不應存在。中國與菲列濱在戰爭中同受重大犧牲，今後應以盟邦之關係力謀經濟上之連繫。麥氏並稱：此次在東京，與麥帥曾作重要之商討，並擬與中國戰區美軍總司令魏德邁將軍討論軍事問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕美駐菲高級專員麥克納昨稱：非島受毀甚大，非一時可以復原，又稱：美人期望在一九四六年七月十四日，使菲人正式獨立，聯合國善後救濟總署已撥款二百萬美元，作爲菲島復原之經費，至於日本佔領期間與日人合作之菲人，已正式受裁判。</p>
<h3>政府與共黨　定下週商談</h3>

<p>〔本報重慶廿一日電〕政府與共產黨之商談，因共產黨代表對商談內容尚朱準備就緒，須展延至下星期舉行。而政治協商會議之日期，在政府與共產黨之商談，未能達入另一步階級時，尚難確實公布。政治協商會議之多數代表，早經內定，茲聞社會賢達方面缺農界人士，對此，正向當局請求推派代表參加</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山電廿日廣播稱。共黨代表周恩來，頃向中國政府提出建議，國共雙方立即無條件中止作戰，藉以便利政治協商會議之進行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿一日電〕馬歇爾特使抵滬之日，共黨　言人曾提議無條件中止作戰，政府方面批評此項提議爲外交辭令，共黨發言人今日復稱，此項提議將用文字發表。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿一日電〕此問以爲共軍提出無條件停戰要求，係削弱華北與東北共黨地位之象徵。一兩月前，延安方面曾拒絕考慮停戰建議，其時，共軍正向內蒙疾進，且已進入張家口，並控制華北及南滿之鐵路與公路交通，現共軍地位已不若彼時之有利。華北鐵路與公路交通收復範圍，亦在逐漸擴展中，國軍增援部隊，已開到平津地區，以組織方法，沿鐵路線推進，東北共軍受蘇聯勸告，自數處退出，國軍正向濟陽移動，且已佔領葫蘆島。此間外國觀察家相信，局勢之演進，似有利於中央政府，並謂，共軍實力必已被估計太高云。共軍正次第自沿海要點及鐵路線被迫撤退。據此間外國觀察家意見，此次要求停戰之試探，實乃爭取時間手段也。外國觀察家對共軍停戰要求，疑係針對馬歇爾元帥而發。無論共軍於遊擊戰中，素質如何良好，彼等決難希望在陣地上對抗正式國軍，在政治軍事兩方面，共黨無不處於劣勢地位。蔣主席之訪問此間，已予共黨一政治上打擊，主席在各階層民衆間，顯已大獲人心，關於處理官員壓迫事件，更獲人民之公開擁護，實予此問之共黨地位以嚴重挫折。</p>

<h3>白山黑水漸露曙光　行政接收即開始　大連等市長分別赴任</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二十日電〕接收東北工礦工作，已隨國軍之進入東北而展開。經濟部東北特派員辦事處接收人員胡安愷等十八人，已分三批抵達錦州。胡等之初步報告，業已到達此間。據稱：錦州附近有電廠，合成燃料廠，紙漿廠，機器廠，紗廠等，規模頗大。各廠在蘇軍駐守期，設備未有移動，共軍撤退前，對此龐大之工廠，亦無法破壞，僅少數機器遭彼等步槍彈穿，然無傷大體。接收工作，日內即行開始。其中二紗廠且由軍政部接收開工，爲國軍趕作衣被。孫越崎在渝物色之接收東北工礦技術人員千人，因阻於交通，決先選四百人，定廿一日由渝專輪赴滬，然後北上。東北工礦浩若烟海，自非此少數技術人員所能接辦，因而主席曾有留用日技術人員之指示，但可能成爲問題者，即受盡日人壓迫之工人，彼等是否仍顧在日高級人員指揮下工作。經濟部東北特派員孫越崎，前道經北去，以未能即赴東北接收，復奉命兼長平津區敵僞產業處理局，整理此三月以來之一團亂絲。主席蒞平時，痛心於接收即停頓，現急令孫三日內擬具平津工廠復工計劃，刻該項計劃已送呈主席核閱，開工當不在遠，惟有若干工廠，因將來產品無出路或缺乏原料，全部復工當不可能。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕記者頃自權威方面探悉：接收東北，外交方面已無問題，國軍所以遲遲未空運長春·哈爾濱者，由於北方國軍須在原地維持治安，華南國軍運至遼遠，而寒冷之東北，勢需相常時問與準備，如禦寒衣物之準備，即煞費周章。目前行政接收工作，將先于空運國軍。瀋陽。哈爾濱，將爲我首先自蘇軍接收之都市。瀋陽市長董文琦，廿一日即隨張嘉璈飛長轉瀋接收，哈市長楊綽庵，大迎市長沈怡廿二日即率市府人員飛畏轉哈分赴任所。宣傳已久之東北工礦問題，據悉，蘇政府並未向我有何建議，馬林諾夫斯基元帥在長時，確曾談及戰利品問題，我方允為蘇方自可將其戰利品運回本國，此後雙方即未再談此一問題。至美軍必要時可協助國軍進入東北之美方聲明，某有力人士稱：此諒係美國在現階段外交中一種姿態，實際我方並未向美方有所請求。遠眺白山黑水，已露魚肚白色，十四年之漫漫長夜，即將破曉矣。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕張嘉璈廿日下午二時由京飛平，蔣經國未同來。張氏廿一日即偕瀋陽市長董文琦，及長春鐵路，中央銀行人員，經錦飛長春。又長春中行定廿二日開幕，中行人員明日即有大批新印之十元。五十元。百元流通券携往。錦州中行最近亦可開行，該處金融情形頗爲紊亂，商民極感不便，設行需要甚爲迫切。</p>

<h3>麥帥協助日本人民　建民主自由政府　依波茨坦宣言掃除一切障礙　麥帥斷然否認渠將引退之說</h3>
<p>〔本報東京二十一日專電〕麥克阿瑟將軍總部頃根據波茨坦會議宣言，下令取消一切與日本神道敎有關之障礙。麥帥此舉用意，在使佔領軍早日達成目標，並協助日本組成以人民自由意志爲基礎之民主政府。盟軍總部認爲神進敎之一切法規，乃促使日本人民成爲侵略國家之主要因素。此後大綱之主要點，厥爲敎育與監導兩種，昔日在刀劍下生活之日本人民，今爲獲致自由，需要援助與領導，而目前領導者之缺乏，已使盟軍佔領工作無從獲得充分發展。自由思想之敎育家與領袖，以往從來不能在日本求得生存及發展，而所有官員幾均武士道與黑龍會所造就之人材，彼等充滿封建思想，澈頭澈尾抱持侵路觀念，巳使日本成爲侵略國。目前彼等多已相繼入獄，使有競爭性之日木政黨，乘勢堀起，並已提出改革日本方案甚多·麥帥頃已致力給予日人，以波茨坦宣言中所規定之憲法改革及建立新體制政府之原則，並竭力促其儘速實現。</p>
<p>〔本報東京廿一日電〕麥克阿瑟將軍今日斷然否認渠將引退辭職之說。據稱渠之來日目的，在完成盟國會議所決定交渠執行之任務，但非爲阻礙美國政策之推行。蘇聯是否將派遣軍隊佔領日本，非其本人聯權範圍所能決定者，而應聽由盟國之指示，但迄現時止，蘇聯從未向麥帥總部陳述派兵來日之請求。據悉麥帥對於蘇聯主張派兵單獨佔領北海道一議，堅持異見。外傳麥帥曾向國務院陳述其個人意見，反對蘇聯參加日本管制一事，杜魯門及美國國務院發言人均已否認外傳麥帥不願蘇軍參加佔領日本而以辭職相要脅之說。</p>
<p>〔本報東京二十一日電〕據美國廣播公司駐東京特派員泰氏報告：麥克阿瑟元帥曾與蘇當局討論佔領軍及政策問題，今日有人以此事詢諸麥帥，麥帥當即予以堅次否認。據稱：「此項報告全無根據，本星期中，本人已否認謠傳兩次，前此一次之謠傳，竟謂本人即擬辭職。本人之任務，乃在執行美國政府之政策。泰氏若確曾傳播此種謠言，則渠顯已受東京街頭流言所愚弄矣。」</p>
<p>杜魯門表示　未聞麥克阿瑟元帥　反對蘇軍參加共管　　〔路透社華盛頓二十一日電〕杜魯門總統昨向報界談稱，余未悉麥克阿瑟元帥有反對蘇聯參加日本之管制之事，東京廣播曾謂麥帥電國務院，如果允許蘇聯參加日本之佔領，渠將辭職云云，本人於此未有所聞。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十日專電〕美國務院發言人今日否認外傳麥帥不願蘇軍參加佔領日本，而將以辭職爲威脅之說。發言人稱：國務院未接麥帥提及美蘇異見之文件。據傳美蘇間異見，在參加佔領日本之蘇軍數量及佔領區之範圍。同時美官方消息，蘇聯尚未答覆日前美方請蘇聯派軍赴日共同佔領日本之建議。美建議係載於美致蘇照會中，內稱，美國予澳大利亞以派單佔領日本之機會，亦願以同樣立塲，使蘇軍參加共問佔領。</p>
<p>〔合衆肚華盛頓二十日電〕美國廣播公司之鐵格自東京廣播稱；由於蘇方與最高司令之意見相左，蘇聯將不派兵至日本。鐵氏稱：麥帥與蘇方之爭議，集中於蘇聯究欲佔領何島。</p>
<p>日軍事設備　仍有隱匿</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿一日電〕今日據美國第六軍宣布：四國島上美軍第二十四師巡邏隊，曾于沿海發見未經報告之鋼骨水泥大堡華數座，並有大量軍用物品藏匿于堆棧內，且在一小學校中，發見許多步槍。白砲，及其他器材，足見日本軍事設備，雖經一再要求報告，仍有隱匿。第六軍於同時宣有四國島上，有日本男女一千人，攻擊一行將放棄之露營，經美守兵開槍阻止，擊倒一人</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京二十日電〕近衛文鷹自殺前，曾於十一月二十二日將修正日本憲法草案呈奏日皇，旋即辭去其代理宮內大臣職務。據每日新聞載稱：草案原文甚長，其中提議繼續保留日皇政治上之權力，惟將其範圍略予削减。日本憲法原載日皇有統治日本之權，此款予以保留，但附加一句謂日皇行使職權時，應由其全體臣民輔弼。日皇雖有權與他國宣戰構和及訂立條約，但事先必須經議會通過，此爲草案中最重要之修正。草案中又提議在議會內設置一委員會，以便通過日島所頒各種緊急法令，此項法令依照習慣，如不經下一屆議會否決，即將成爲法律，在軍事期間各項緊急法令常被濫用。草案中並主張改革日本貴族院，置海陸軍於政府管理之下，同時使日議會可自行召集或解散，截至目前爲止，僅日皇有權可以召集或解散鐵會。據悉日皇將草案披閱後，即將其交與內閣並調示日政府將以此方案爲基礎，考慮修改憲法稱，刻猶未獲蘇聯之通知。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京廿一日電〕聯合國最高統帥部公共衛生幸福組主任薩摩士，今日指斥日本政府人員，對於日本糧食問題，故作危詞，以圖取得美國接濟，日人今冬所獲食物，可較歐洲戰敗國爲多，並無絕食危險。其食糧形勢，冬令雖顯緊張，市區食物缺乏，或亦在所不免，但觀聯合國最高統帥部之米糧配給數量，足見現有充分食物，可供給每人每日一千五百卡路利熱力，此種配給可繼續至明年四五月問。據日人以前估計，每日最多祗可得一千三百七十五卡路利，及蛋白質四十一公分。</p>

<h3>經數度探索性談話後　三強猜疑可消除　蘇聯要求收回喬治亞失士</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科二十一日電〕此間消息靈通人士今日宣稱：英美蘇三國外長舉行探索性之談話後，三國團結一致，較未開會前爲甚。若干懷疑，殆有消失之望。會議第六日適爲史達林元帥六秩晋六誕辰，茲很據外國方面報告，分析情勢如下：（一）現有一種强烈感覺，預料該會將有一部份結果，或將較原來希望者更佳，但三强間每一爭執，似不能在該會中解次。（二）美國務卿貝爾納斯及英外相貝文不欲將英美人民之希望，張揚過甚。（三）三外長無意控制聯合國機構，但三强在戰時合作無間，今後仍可經由此項合作盡其最善。（四）聯合國機構如能望其處理一切事件，則各國無需乎大使及公使。（五）五國外長委員會，包括三外長及中法兩外長，無意予以解散。但聯合囤機構顯應立即開始接收該委會一部份工作。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科二十一日電〕莫斯科會議之注意，似已自伊朗移向土耳其。昨日蘇聯多數報紙咸揭載二位喬治亞學者致喬治亞邦首邑蒂夫利斯某報之函，要求土耳其交還奪自喬治亞共和國之土地。按喬治亞共和國，乃史達林之故鄉，英外相貝文暨美國務鄉貝爾納斯昨日已開始研究此項要求。該函大意謂，「目前土耳其當局正更改喬治亞之地名，拆除歷史紀念建築物，並强迫居民遷至遙遠之地。在對德國作戰時，土耳其因帮助德意志帝國而侵佔喬治亞之土地，今日必須交還喬治亞人民」云。莫斯科外交界人士對此舉甚爲注意。星期三夜史達林接見貝文及貝爾納斯時，據云曾談及「互相關切」之問題，惟僅係外交上之草議性質。此次接見以後，喬治亞之間題遂即引起各方面之注意。關於莫斯科會議情形，官方仍力持緘默，惟悉空氣仍極友善，而工作則已加緊進行。　〔合衆社莫斯科二十日電〕蘇官方報紙今日顯明表示蘇聯要求土耳其割讓其黑海沿岸鄰近蘇聯港口巴統之土地五萬五千方哩，在此要求割讓之土地內，包括土港德里拜崇及蘇土接境南方一一〇哩深五十哩之海岸一部分。</p>

<p>在這短短的一秋中，撤銷了幾個組織龐大的軍事機構，增加了大批失業軍人，杜聿明司令，仲秋在昆明完成了滇省府改組工作後，又在山海關外幹得有聲有色，人皆謂杜氏「走紅運」。關總司令在昆就職後，也曾有聲有色，爲時僅三十九天，即因學潮而「引咎自劾」以去。昆市最近</p>
<p>公然在鬧市行刧者。入夜常聞槍聲，人心惶惶不寗，散兵游勇收容所，宣告有人滿之患。「國際路綫」失却了主顧，如流鶑亂舞。工廠與招待所，相繼緊縮結束，廠主奔走呼號求救濟，大批員工徬徨街頭，在這號稱二十八萬人的「不夜之城」中，各種有聲與無聲的變化，正在急劇的進行。假如你在秋之夜，願意接受這些聲響的刺激，你會覺得興奮，緊張，沉默，隱憂，悲痛，與啼笑皆非之感，表現於此秋者異常顯著。這些事態的產生和變化，固爲戰後不可避免者，推其原因，亦不可忽略人事上的影響，爰就記者所攝取的幾個鏡頭，把它的輪廓描寫一下。</p>
<p>五華山頭　一迎一送</p>
<p>滇省前主席龍雲，在滇十八年·十月三日，因省府改組而引起的槍聲，昆市「一般人民素不習見，即視爲奇異」。（引用盧主席語）由奇異而產生的反饗，經過了一個時期，始告安定。龍前主席乘專機飛渝，李代主席到省府視事之日，全市仍在緊張冷靜狀態中。是日中午，國旗飄揚市區，從五華山到飛機塲，夾道警戒嚴密，數十輛「送舊」的小包車，疾馳過市，沒有人想到燃放鞭砲，表示迎新之意。十二月一日，盧主席到省府視事，全市復見國旗飄揚。但當李代主席被省府樂隊送下山（五華山）時，市面鞭砲聲大作，所費的在千萬元以上，是乃最近之兩支插曲也。</p>
<p>田園都市　東方瑞士</p>
<p>在這迎新送舊期中，昆市各報上增加了許多有聲有色的材料，也許爲一部份人所「不習見」者，但依據這些材料，可看出在這個變的過程中，留下了什麽痕跡，表現了什麼作風，發生了什麽後果。李代主席視事之初，首在省黨部茶會中，宣佈治旗三原則六綱領。十二月一日，李氏最後以代主席身份，歡迎盧主席視事時，曾致詞曰：「本人倉卒奉命回滇，兼代主席職務，兩月以來，夙興夜寐，未敢或懈。」這是事實。</p>
<p>據聞自兼代主席之日起，每天工作十六小時，由設計執行到考核，整個三聯制，事必躬親，當其在五華山的五十五天中，擬訂了雲南施政綱領草案，出席了大小三十餘次集會或會議，發表了的三萬言的講演。（據某記者估計）。在其講演中，提倡朝氣之後，繼之以提倡正氣，提倡工作競賽，禁絕烟。賭。娼，完成地方自治。對於昆明，他希望「把昆明變成東方的瑞士，變成田　化的都市」。（十月二十七日講詞）對於黨政軍民，他提倡四位一體，對於他所居住的五華出，他說：「五華山爲省政府所在地，爲人民所公有，非任何個人，任何政府所得而私有，天下者，天下人之天下也，惟有德者居之」（十月二十二日講詞。）他爲了「勤求民　」在昆市各城門口義置了民意箱。他爲了「試行民主」曾在民政廳實行公選庶務股長，他為了尊重長老，曾在昆明縣參議會　席上，替同席長老盛飯。這些事實，固然足以表現他的「未敢或懈」而在同時期內，發生於社會各方面的呼聲，正在此偃彼　的演奏。</p>
<p>十二月一日，盧主席視事，在其視事講詞中，可看出盧氏的另一個作風。（一）主張「爲政不在多言，」「言則一不檢點即易喪失政府威信，不惟個人使人民輕視，而連帶足以使人民輕視政府。」（二）對於龍前主席任內，「過去一切義政，自應蕭規曹隨。」（三）目前「最重要的工作，首在如何維持地方治安，力求社會安定。」盧氏視事儀式，於一日上午十時二十分完畢。西南聯大於十一時發生手溜彈案盧氏曾於十日發表告各校學生書，首云：「漢不幸，就職之日，即昆明學潮蘸成慘案之時。」盧氏視事於秋去冬來之際，首先迎接到這一個比較複雜困難的問題，問題由何而起，或曰：「秋聲之賜也。」</p>
<p>翠湖道上　關去霍來</p>
<p>十一月十八日五華山上舉行盛大晚宴，歡送社聿明赴東北，歡迎關麟微來昆明。李代主席致詞稱：「雲南的水是倒流的，在雲南的外籍軍政長官，往往是去而復回。」此語係指關杜對調職位而言。關氏駐防滇南有年，中樞首定關氏爲東北九省保安司令，故其僚屬大多已集中在渝待命，後來發表關氏爲滇省警備總司令，彼即忽促圓昆，積極籌備成立總部。最初連伙伕都沒有，爲時僅半月，該部於十一月一日正式在羣湖成立。關氏尚未宣誓就職以前，半個月中市區發生了十一件搶刦案，旣刦財，又撕票，民心憤慨，惶惶不寗。但在二十天內，卒獲全部破案。這點成績，替該部建立了幾分信仰。自十一月一日起，關氏積極推行其維持治安計劃，計有淸查戶口，登記自衛槍枝，管制公私車輛，取締散兵游勇，實行分區警備等項。十一月二十四日，該部發佈第六號佈告，說明「昆市治安，已告平定。」但在十一月二十五日深夜，警備部隊突然發表一新聞稿，內稱「本市西門外白泥坡附近，二十五日晚七時許，發生匪警，當地駐軍據報後，即趕往捕捉，匪徒竟一面鳴槍，一面向黑暗中逃竄而散。」記者當時亦在西門外，曾聽到手榴彈與機槍聲，足見匪徒勢力不小。</p>
<p>學校治安　突呈不穩</p>
<p>從十一月一日到廿四日，市區治安旣告平安，而自廿六日起，學校治安忽告不穩定，十二月一日，聯大發生手溜彈案，死傷二十餘人。關氏於當日下午，親往華事地點調查，並慰問受傷學生，警備總部吳參謀長於四日發表談話，報告關民前往慰問的情况，略謂：「當時本部同人恐出意外，一再阻止前往，敝總司令爲責任心與惻隱心所促使，堅決前往。返部時，同人等見其神色之抑鬱，爲蘇來慘戰中所未見。」十二月七日，關氏電呈　蔣委員長，自請處分，並以此次慘案之發生，皆因身任治安之責，事前疏於防範所致。所有懲罰，「皆願一身受之」。關氏九日飛渝，中央於十日公佈，將關氏免職，聽候議處。警備總司令職務，令派霍揆彰代理。</p>
<p>霍代總司令，已於七日由渝來昆。截至十五日止，雖尚未赴翠湖總部，正式視事，但在實際上，已代關氏負起了警備責任。霍氏係滇西反攻戰役中的健將，駐防滇境亦已有年，並曾在渝代理靑年軍總監兼第六軍軍長，現在回到昆明，不免又使記者想到「滇水倒流」之句。</p>
<p>大西門外　聲色俱厲</p>
<p>秋去冬來之際，大西門外聲色俱厲。此事發生於十一月廿五日晚上，迄今猶未平息。在過去三週內，記者常聽到學生的吶喊聲，爭辯聲，抗議聲，唾駡聲，講演聲，也曾聽到敎授的勸導聲，抗議聲，「暴徒」的呼嘯聲，鄒彈聲，社會人士的弔唁聲，與靑年男女的呼號哭泣聲。在過去三週內，記者常看到五光十色的標語，口號，傳單，漫畫，與各種鉛印，石印，油印，墨寫的宣傳品，散佈在學校內，在市區內，在黑板上，在牆壁上，在公共汽車上，在多少人的心坎上。各種聲音，交互刺激，各種顏色，交互影響，這就結束了聲色俱厲的一幕。（卅四年十二月十七日寄自昆明）</p>
<h3>佛敎整委會之誕生</h3>
<p>（重慶航訊）中國佛敎會整理委員會定於本（二十二）日在渝成立，太虛法師特撰文闡述意義，原文如次：「慨自全面抗日戰興，京滬未幾淪陷，中國佛敎會即告停頓。東南北各省縣區域，多漸次阻隔不通，佛敎寺僧信徒，固與一般人民同處敵僞蹂躪之下，沉痛莫伸，而西南北大後方佛敎僧徒，亦因失去全國性佛敎機構之領導，雖各自分途爲僧救護隊，佛敎傷兵慰勞隊，及看護，宣傳，募捐，捐獻，並響應知識靑年從軍，參加游　戰，救濟流亡難胞等，服務國族民衆之行動，未能成爲普遍的系統的組織，得中樞與各省區政府社會充分之注意與援助，反以寺們馴善可欺，受盡土豪劣紳貪官汚吏，假偕兵役，繳獻種種非法橫暴的摧剝，凌慮，枉有中樞疊次煌煌保護之政令，困苦之下情，莫由上達，恩澤之上德，莫由下逮，積鬱成政府與人民間慘悽之戾氣，而各省縣有佛敎會者，各爲局部之營救，本身之姐織旣多未健全，又無在中權全國性教會爲之呼號，宣導，遂較一般平民更遭加倍之哀痛。今幸民族之抗戰勝利，國家之建設開始，社會內政兩部呈准行政院有「中國佛敎會整理委員會」之組設，期於半年　一年內召開全國佛敎徒代表大會，加强健全「中國佛敎會」及「各省縣佛敎分支會」之機，構適應一躍已爲國際上四强之一的新中國的需要，使佛敎亦成爲新中國之新佛教。（中略）全國佛教同人，當各棄嫌怨，共敦誼好，爲情誠之團集，成水浮之和合，迅赴弘敷佛法於全國全世界之千　一時機會！並希全國朝野賢達，與世界崇眞藥善之士，咸贊導焉！」</p>
<p>水塔奇觀</p>
<p>美蘇兩國，以創建大水閘著稱於世，而在美國，尤足令人認此爲天下壯觀之一。圖示：美國加州北部沙士達山大水閘最高層水塔的尖頂上面，建有七枝粗大的電攬，從那邊發出電力，以推動附近的各個水塔。</p>

<h3>三國外長會議與遠東局勢</h3>
<p>美英蘇三國外長會議在莫斯科召開以來，瞬將一週。這一周來，三國代表接觸頻繁；史達林元帥亦自南俄黑海一帶養疴歸來，在莫斯科接見英美二國的外長，會議似漸入重要階段。雖會議討論情形，嚴守秘密，致一般議程，無從明悉，然會議旣經召開，必將討論與三國利益共同有關之各項問題，特別是關於遠東局勢的問題，自屬可信。據蘇京傳來消息，謂蘇聯報紙對於日本，中國，及越南之情形，時表不滿，由此亦可想見遠東局勢確爲三國談話主題之一。此雖不免臆測，要亦不爲無見也。</p>
<p>曠觀世局，目前遠東的確充滿着許多危險成分，而其問題的內容也很複雜。遠東局勢如何推移，不但與遠東各國有關，且可影響整個世界的和平。中國爲遠東首先反抗侵略的大國，對遠東問題的處理，無疑的應有其發言權。而今日坐視三國外長會議舉行於蘇京，中國問題或且列爲議程之一，我駐蘇大使反祗有從分訪英美外長時得其若干消息，我們實在應該自愧自責！試想，在目前所謂遠東局勢，諸如統治戰敗的日本問題，韓國局勢的處理問題，以及有關中國，越南，乃至南亞方面的所謂民族自主遝動等問題，那一個問題不應爲中國所注意，那一個問題中國可以不加過問？在三國外長會議召開之際，曾聞將不討論到與其他大國有關的問題，而現在旣然注意遠東局勢，我們以中國人民的立塲不能不說幾句話。</p>
<p>遠東局勢的關鍵，不在如何統治戰敗的日本，或是如何支持戰後復興的中國，而是在於主要的聯合國如何採取協調的步驟。關於戰後日本的管制問題，雖蘇聯拒絕參加遠東顧問委員會，但它所主張的盟國共同管制日本的原則，當可爲盟國所接受。其問題不是原則上意見的歧異，而是執行上技術的枝節。據聯合社東京消息，麥克阿瑟元帥鑒於美蘇對管制日本問題意見不一致，已電告美國務院，如彼無全權，彼即辭職。此所謂意見不一致者，當非原則上的問題，而是執行上的問題。據稱；「蘇聯要求派軍隊來日本，麥帥只允許蘇方派一個師團，蘇聯欲佔領北海道，麥帥拒絕該項請求，但允蘇軍駐九州。」可知美蘇對於共同管制日本，不是原則上有爭執，而是在執行方面有歧見。今三國外長集於蘇京，接觸頻繁，可能使若干誤會消除，覔取適當解決的途徑。</p>
<p>其次，關於韓國問題，高麗半島本來是山多地瘠，今美蘇兩軍的佔領區將韓國宰割爲二，使高麗民族，從中腰斬，而這兩個佔領區間彼此又不相溝通，這眞是加重了高麗人民的痛苦。扶助高麗人民獨立自主，應爲美蘇的共同意志，相信目前這種局勢，不難在眞誠協調之下求得改善。</p>
<p>與韓國局勢相反的情形，却在南亞各處蓬勃地展開着。在印度尼西亞，就展開着所　印度尼西亞人的民族獨立運動，與佔領的盟軍時有衝突，同樣的情形，也在越南出現。關於印度尼西亞的獨立運動，據說內中有日人的操縱，其武器亦得自日人；是其遝動多少似曾受到所謂「大東亞」宣傳的毒素。不管這些傳聞是否可靠，而在南亞方面，可能中「大東亞」之毒的成分，當是很高。日人在過去曾煽動在殖民地統治下的人民，今日人雖降，不免仍有若干遺毒存留其間，自亦可能。所以聯合國對於處理亞洲民族問題的態度，實在不應該再墨守曩年帝國主義的成規，重新確定新作風，否　無以自解於大西洋憲章及聯合國宣言。</p>
<p>在中國方面，自中蘇條約簽訂以來，中國自動地在其主權的行使上加上了若干限制。這無非表示我們如何希望國際間能够密切合作，故小惜自我犧牲。但自條約簽訂以來，一切發展，未必盡如預期的理想。到今天，我們的國軍還沒有能很愉快的踏入瀋陽長春，而這幾日來的消息，尤爲沉悶。中國內部的共黨問題，如任中國自行處理，相信一定能循和平途徑作合理的解決，而外力干涉有時反足以增加糾紛的因素。今杜魯門總統旣有明確政策的宣布，希望中國在國民政府領導之下和平統一，而不願有任何千涉行動，三國外長又相聚蘇京，我們相信中國的局勢必可益見明朗。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰導源於遠東問題，我們萬不能再讓第三次大戰再由遠東醞釀。聯合國以前對敵比肩作戰，今日敵寇稱降，尤應共同一致建立和平。遠東問題的癥結，不是在目的之不同，而是在執行上的困難。這些困難不是無法克服的。如何克服這些困難，就賴於各國的密切合作。三國外長會議召開於蘇京，正足以顯示三國有密切合作共同的要求，而三國以外的各大國也應有其開誠坦白交換意見以共一致的機會，必須如此，則一切問題始不難迎刃而解。</p>

<h3>公債大戶逢高出籠　　外股繼續上漲　華股初疲後堅</h3>

<p>外股再接再厲，人心續好，各方面對外股抱無取希望，持有者始終不肯輕易脫手，以致需碼在證券銀錢搜購下，倍形枯竭，市價在買戶種種冀求下，扶搖直上，午刻遂再以高價收市，結果再漲一成至二成不等，英商綸昌染織廠今日復業，此後外商廠家自必陸續復工，外股前途殊見光明。</p>

<h3>上海市敎育會義辦　敎育貸金委會宣言</h3>
<p>上海市敎育會主辦之上海市敎育貸金委員合，自發動全市中小學校隊募捐以來，已有同義中小學，亞開小學，民國中小學，崇實中小學等校，先後響應，捐募鉅款，其他各校均在陸續進行中，至熱心貸金運動尚未進行之各校，可至中正中路七三五號該會接洽，茲將該會宣言照錄如下：　誰也不能否認，無論在戰時或平時，敎育總是最基本的國防工作，沒有良好的敎育，根本就不必去談別的國防，世界上某些國家的所以能强盛，也全持敎育的發達，然而試看我們的敎育國防如何呢？</p>
<p>就拿我國文化的心臟——上海來說罷，雖然沒有什麽專家在這方面做過準確的統計，但由於耳濡目染之所及，大家一定也知道牠是遭到如何的命運的。</p>
<p>好許多學齡兒童，他們因爲無力入學，有的便在街頭做時化，或是在巷尾拾荒，也有許多被驅逐到市井裹去充小販，趕到工廠裏去作工人，更有不少有爲的靑年，爲了生活艱苦，也被摒棄在學校的大門外面，有的祗得投身到社會裏去，有的因爲找不到職業而站在十字路口徬徨。</p>
<p>我們再放眼看一看負責敎導和訓練這些未來主人翁的人的境况罷。全上海的敎師，和教授們，從抗戰開始起，幾乎無時無刻不在饑饉綫的邊際上掙扎着，許多再也不能忍受生活巨鞭抽打的，已漸漸地跳出了這個淸苦的敎育界，而去另謀出路了。至於那些無路可走而對敎育工作有特殊志趣的，雖然他們的收入比街上的車夫還要來得微薄，現在却依然是咬緊着牙關而苦鬬，不過，他們究竟能苦鬬到什麼程度和什麽時候，這實在是很値得憂慮的。</p>
<p>「看了這些悽慘的情形，我們不能就認爲這是上海敎育破產的預兆，這是社會的一大危機，也不能認爲這僅是因爲我們國家或地方政府負責不力而造成的後果，要知道，自從抗戰勝利以後，國家和地方政府都有成千累萬的事情要幹，次不能全力集中在這個工作上面去。同時我們也不必寒心，上海敎育旣已陷於這種懷境，上海市民旣已臨到這個危機，每一個市民都不能袖手旁觀，我們都要負起取法補救的責任，我們次不能把這個責任完全推到中央政府和地方政府的肩頭上去，我們應該儘量地，自動地起來謀劃救濟的方法，所以我們組織了上海市敎育貸金委員會。</p>
<p>上海的歷史曾經這樣告訴我們：自中華民國建立以來，凡是一切大規模的愛國運動，文化運動，救濟運動在全市市民的熟烈推動下，上海都能獲得最優越的最光榮的成功，當然，我們這一次的敎育貸金運動也不能例外，我們希望社會人士都能瞭解和贊助，國家和社會的前途光明與吾，全繫於我們下地代的國民身上，我們要灌溉和培養這一枝處於風雨飄搖中的嫩芽，就一定要有力出力，有錢出錢，踴躍地贊助，使牠茁壯起來，開出絢爛的花朶來。</p>
<p>總之，我們都深信上海人士是不會使我們對於這一意義深邃的貸金運動稍有失望的！</p>

<p>錢市長致詞略謂：本市戰後復興事業，經緯萬端，不是一人所能担任，需要泰策羣力，始能成功。本人忝爲上海市長，深切希望各位委員和本人與市政府盡力合作，隨時提供高見。上海所要解決的問題很多，凡是大都市大商埠所具有的各種問題，我們都遭遇到的。本人奉命來長本市，深覺責任艱鉅，而本人能力有限，但自受命以來，無時無刻不圖减輕市民的苦痛。促進本市的復興，並且計劃本市將來的發展，務使全市居民，不論種族·宗敎·國籍都能安居樂業。本府爲集思廣益起見；設立市政諮議委員會，本人深信此後我們對於有關本市市政的一切問題，必能得到中外領袖們高明的指敎。</p>
<p>任務有三</p>
<p>諸位已經知道諮議委員會的職掌有三。第一，是對於本人交議的市政事件，加以審議。第二，是關於市政問題提出建議。第三，是向臨時市參議會供獻意見。我們希望本市中外居民的希望和意見，能通過諮議委員而傳達於市政當局，使市府的施政能切合市民需要。諸位：諮議委員會的任務並不是消極的，各位委員並不限於審議本人的交議事件。各位儘可自動的提出意見和建議。諮議委員會所提供的建議，於必要時，可以提交不久即將成立的臨時市參議會討論。如果在市參議會裏通過了，那末這種建談案就具有充分法律上的力量，格外重要了。本市外僑很多，這個由中外居民領袖聯合組成的諮議委員會，在本市市民團體中當然佔着一個極重要的地位，雖然和我們中國居民相比較，外僑所佔的比率並不大，但是我們仍覺得有請外僑領袖也參加這個諮議委員會的需要，所以本人深信諮議委員會的設立，可以促進中外諒解和合作。</p>
<p>接受提議</p>
<p>諸位都是服務本市多年，熱心公益，經驗豐富，得到居民一致推崇的領袖。本人對於諸位寄予完全的信任和不變的信仰，希望諸位能够協助本人促進市政典革，諸位有所見聞即是本人的見聞，在許多方面本人將要靠着諸位得到正確的見聞和適當的提議，使上海不但成爲遠東的主要都市，而且繼續立於世界大都市之林。本人願望諸位能够時常提供關於市政的意見，至於在本人方面，一定竭誠和諸位合作，並且儘可能範圍之內，接受諸位的童見和提議。</p>

<h3>上海市政的新猷</h3>
<p>上海市政府爲集思廣益翼贊市政之推行起見，設上海市政諮議委員會，延聘中英美法各國領袖人士爲委員，由顏惠慶氏出任主任委員，業於日昨宣布成立。市長錢大鈞氏在該會成立時說：「本市戰後復興事業，經緯萬端，不是一人所能担任，需要羣策羣力，始能成功。」這固足以表示市長的謙遜，實亦說明了政府如何殷切的希望。在不平等條約下，上海原有租界的獨自行政。如今不平等條約宣告廢止，租界行政亦隨同消滅；可是上海爲中國第一商港，居留其間的外僑在全市人口中所佔的百分比雖不大，但爲數亦不在少；就中對於市政的設施，或則深有經騐，或則學有專長，在在足爲市政當局臂助。今上海市政常局延爲委員，組織上海市政諮議委員會，深信對於市政，必多貢獻。</p>
<p>上海是〔個國際的都市，戰後復興事業，誠如錢市長所云，經緯萬端。這需要中外市民的衷心合作。上海市政諮議委員會的成立，表示市政當局如何甘願虛心接受外僑及我各界領袖之翼贊，如何蔪致中外諒解和合作的增進，我們願這市政的新機構，能够達成它所負的任務，進而爲中外合作樹一楷模！</p>

<h3>美國夜戰飛機「黑寡婦」</h3>
<p>— 司命</p>
<p>美國空軍自從去年在成都設立了飛行堡壘基地後，在東亞戰塲方面，給日軍一個重大的致命打擊，B29型此後常到日本去轟炸，使敵人驚惶萬分，他們急得拼命地探查美國空軍基地，終於確定是成都機塲了，於是就冒險去轟炸，可是那面防備嚴密，日寇的白晝空襲失敗之後，　實行夜間轟炸，那時美國空軍供應歐，就派了四架夜戰飛機名『黑寡婦』（Blakc　Widow），到成的製造，非常巧妙神秘，專門適合夜間戰鬬之用，飛機爲單發動機雙體式，航空員祗有一名，任駕駛員外，更兼小鋼砲手，該機全身塗以隱身漆，這種漆的顏色只會吸收光綫，而不致反射出來，所以它在夜間飛行，人家不易看見它，道是它的特色之一。</p>
<p>至於機身內部，完全用肉眼所看不見的紫外綫指示各部機關，駕駛員載有特製儀器，仍可看見一切東西，因此敵人不易發現她的所在地，這是她的特色之二。</p>
<p>第三個特色，就是飛機中裝有一具羅盤針似的秘密儀器，用無錢電波控制一個相當廣大的空間，若敵機飛進這電波範圍內，那羅盤針就會自行轉動，指示出那架敵機的方向，駕駛員可一目瞭然地向目標去襲擊了。據美國空軍說：這具神秘羅盤針，是根據菲洲一種黑蜘蛛的捕蟲方法發明的，因爲蜘蛛捕蟲時，常常獨坐在蛛網中央，等候食物，一且有飛蟲撞到網上時，就有蜘蛛絲去牽動蜘蛛，蜘蛛立刻依照方向走去把那只蟲捉住，這個聰明巧妙的方法，引起了科學家的興趣，模仿了牠而發明出那具羅盤針，去應用在夜間戰鬬機上，該種蜘蛛名呌『黑寡婦』，所以這種夜戰機也呌做『黑寡婦』了。</p>
<p>晚上遇到空襲警報時，地面其他的戰鬥機全部躱藏起來，以免誤會，『黑寡婦』立即升空應戰，它飛得極高，四出巡邏，等候敵機，當它的羅盤內發現了目標後，它就很快的照了方向飛去攻擊，敵機還沒有發現它，而它倒早已飛在敵機頂上了，忽見它腹部開起兩盞强光探照燈，直迫目標，一時弄得敵機駕員眼花頭暈，手足無措，正在這危急的當兒，『黑寡婦』的腹部發射出一種小鋼砲彈，蓬的一聲立刻把敵機送了老命！一待任務完畢，她再升到上空去搜索敵機，這種可怕的突擊，簡直使敵人無法應付。</p>
<p>在今年三月間某夜，有日機十餘架來襲成都基地，吾方出動了四架『黑寡婦』，竟把日機全部擊落，一無生還，建立了一個偉大的職果，弄得日寇莫明其妙，大爲驚駭，從此以後，再不敢來轟炸了。自從那次秘密飛機的驚人消息傳出後，大後方的民衆莫不同聲讚美『黑寡婦』，但仍有好多人不知內中詳情，竟以爲那次擊落十餘架敵機的『黑寡婦』，是美國的著名女空軍哩！</p>

<h3>靠右走小論</h3>
<p>— 一飛</p>
<p>自明年元旦起，上海人行路，由靠左走而變爲靠右走，隨世界潮流而改進。</p>
<p>竊此項運動，如欲實行，務須求其普遍，非僅大城市必須如此，窮鄉僻壤，亦當實施，庶幾全國一致，便利交通，否則各地制度不同，一以左行，一以右行，人民往來，覺不易遭橫禍？</p>
<p>我覺得在實行之先，各地應預行大衆化的訓練，俾使每個人民，都能具有此種右行常識。其方法可分爲三點：</p>
<p>（一）學校—學校爲知識傳達的機關，可指定各校校長常局，將此實行方法，敎導學生，使一般普通家庭，都能明瞭。</p>
<p>（二）保甲—保甲是行政管理的組織，一聲令下，萬民遵守。此事可命各保各甲保甲長，對其所轄地區的人民，多加告誡，俾易普遍。</p>
<p>（三）廣播—如因前述二法，不能使人民全部明瞭，更可規定時問，廣播演講，庶幾各階級的人，都能深切瞭解此項方針，全體實行。</p>

<h3>性的問題</h3>
<p>— 崔景泰</p>
<p>星期三我到一家書店裏去翻看書報。該店有新出版的書好幾種，每種有十來本陳列在櫃台上任人取閱。看書的人很多。在那列新書中有一個空檔，一看空檔中的書僅存一本了，那是藹理斯著的性心理中譯本好幾個男靑年在捧着擴，都看得很出神似的。我把那本僅剩的性心理取到手裏，光看了看定價，相當貴，折僞幣算要十多萬元呢！不得已揀自己想知道的先看。看了一回，發覺身後有人在看我所看的，我倒覺得有點不好意思起來，心念一分，書的內容也看不進了，胡亂地翻了一回就放還原處；隨即有人拿去。我順便在那人背後看了看那書的封面上有一行小字寫着：『研究人生一個最嚴重的問題」。</p>
<p>前一天，敎社會心理學的張耀翔先生正講到人的幾種先天的衝動，他說：「人在生命中最大的衝動，第一是飢餓，第二就是性慾：這次世界大戰，令人感到最有趣的事，大槪要算希特勒在砲聲震撼的柏林陣營中和他的愛人結婚。這個使人可怖又可恨的一代魔王，在他眼見大勢去矣，不得不自殺的前一天，竟然在他那種令人難以揣摹得出的紛亂的情緒中，完成了他一生中呌人莫測究竟的大事；溫莎公爵爲了辛博生夫人棄了皇位，也成爲一種很有人情味的美談。高風亮節的蘇武，身處胡地，吞　飲雪，在十九年的苦難歲月裏，竟和胡地公主結婚生育。西行漫記作者斯諾在那書裏記述他訪問毛澤東先生時曾問毛先生對於女人有什麼感想？毛先生答說，不感興趣；可是隔了不久，毛先生和從上海去的電影明星藍蘋女士結婚了。法國拿破崙臨死時，頻呼他的髮妻的名字，好像他把世俗的一切都忘了。傾國傾城，羅宮春色，那些偉大的歷史影片，假使沒有主角的性愛的事，怎能成功一部感人肺腑的影片。』</p>
<p>余日宣敎授有一天對一班靑年人談修養問題中，也說到他在中學裏讀書時，聽到有好些同學歡喜談性，他覺得可惡，就去告訴先生。先生對他說，很好，你不歡喜談性，不過對於性的事，心裏想不想？他被先生這一問，不由得臉紅了，低了頭，心裏承認：想的。</p>
<p>性，誰不想？問題就壞在這想的上面了！</p>
<p>性在人的生命中像一把烈火，牠雖能養育人，但亦易摧毀人。</p>
<p>人類在自然科學，赴會科學方面都有了很多的貢獻，可是對於人自已本身部還是愚昧得很。我們一代的人，甚麽時候才能有開明正確的性觀念呢？</p>

<h3>刻章的難易</h3>
<p>— 文荃</p>
<p>刻『白文』容易還是『朱文』容易呢？每一個想學刻章的人往往這樣地去問人家。有刻章經騐者一定會告訴他，當先從『自文』學起，然後再學「朱文』。誠然，在初學者刻『白文』確是較『朱文』來得容易學習。</p>
<p>或者你要以爲不然，因為你第二步學習『朱文』而有相當的熟練以後，再回過去刻『白文』的時候，反而感到『白文』難刻，似乎『朱文』是來得容易起來；若是再經過了一段的時間，你再去刻『朱文』，那末，同樣地會感到『朱文』又比『白文』難刻了，於是這樣地一難一易，一易一難，反覆轉換。</p>
<p>其實，這並不是刻『白文』與『朱文』誰難誰易的問題，實際乃在你對於刻『白文』和『朱文』的熟練與疏遠的關係；刻了一時的『朱文』，因爲熟練的緣故，就感到容易，而『白文』因有一時的疏遠，於是覺得難了起來。那末，同樣的道理，刻了一時的「白文」，再去刻『朱文』，也有難易的感覺。</p>
<p>刻章如此，求學做事也何嘗不是如此！</p>
<p>文字</p>
<h3>漢字橫寫問題</h3>
<p>— 王樹良</p>
<p>記得從前國外也有人曾提出問過：『你們中國字橫寫時，到底是自左至右，還是自右至左？』這在模稜兩可的國人，眞是無從回答了。現在，恐怕還有人會滬樣問吧！市敎育局於十一月二十四日特地出了一張通令給各中小學校及各社敎職敎機關，規定『中文橫寫時無論圖表匾額路牌及其他一切文件廣告等均應由右至左。」</p>
<p>事實上中文寫時自右至左本是我國傳統的習慣，而後來一部份文字橫行時改爲自左至右。郤也有它不得已的苦衷。最先是許多夾雜阿刺伯數字的文章，如研討算術的，硏討會計的等等。其次是科學工程方面的文章，其中往往夾雜公式數字，還要加註羅馬字的學術專名。而在現在世界文化交流日密的時候，有許多文章也是需要加註羅馬字的原名和附列西文的。此外還有音樂五錢譜上所諧的中文歌詞。……這些在橫寫時，若改成自右至左，就不便利，甚至於不可能！</p>
<p>尤其在用筆書寫的時候，因爲普通人都是用右手寫字的，橫行自左至右；若自上而下，可以寫得很好，每一個字可以與已經寫過的許多字比對整齊；最後寫到紙的右下方，右手恢復原來近身的位置，也是很合自然的。但是，假使橫寫時自右至左呢？那就不易寫好了。因爲用右手寫時會把右邊已寫的字都遮沒。一方面固然無法比對整齊，一方面還容易把才寫的字跡揩糊。爲什麽中文直行書寫時，自右至左就沒有問題了呢？這是因爲由上而下時，每一字均可與上面各字比對整齊，而當換一行書寫時，祗須把第一字的地位對好，下面各字便可連貫而下了。</p>
<p>橫行的方向和書本裝訂的方向關係是很密切的。一本書，假定裝訂在右面，橫行自左至右，看起來是不順眼的。反之亦然。而現在我國的書報文件，似頗有下列之趨勢：（一）書本裝訂在右面的。橫行自右至左；書本裝訂在左面的，橫行自左自右。（二）自右至左之直行文字中或旁可以夾雜橫行文字的，橫行文字自右至左。（如將字橫倒排列成直行之方向者則自左至右）。（三）匾額牌示，以傳統之習慣一時不易打破尚多自右至左。但長篇累牘的橫行文字自右至左者已不經見了。</p>
<p>總之，漢字橫寫，自右至左有時是不方便的，不可能的。但自右至左之橫行差不多沒有不可能改爲自左至右的。而且橫寫時自左至右正符合國際化，對於倡進科學工程更有不可忽略之處。當今市敎育局的正副局長都是工程敎育界前輩，對此當有同感。那麼，請收回成命吧！</p>

<h3>鷄尾酒的起源</h3>
<p>— 穆葉</p>
<p>近來報上時常登載舉行『鷄尾酒會』的新聞，聽說舉辦一次，需費法幣一百萬左右，可見其豪華之一斑。</p>
<p>鷄尾酒原是Cocktail一字的意譯。味道甜酸氣質芳香，因爲它是用威士忌白蘭地等酒類，再加入沙糖香料苦酒（醋）混合而成。這種名酒，大多產自美國，開始盛行約在一百年前。</p>
<p>據說發明這種名貴飲料的人，是一個墨西哥的貴族，這個貴族有一位漂亮的女兒，名呌Xochitt，有一天他泡製了這酒，命女見親自進獻給國王。不料國王一看見她，便傾心相愛，將酒一飲而盡，並且就用她的芳名來賜稱這酒。後來Xochitt轉變為Cocktail，就是現在的鷄尾酒了。</p>

<h3>Marshall Departs Shanghai for Nanjing Yesterday, Chairman and Madame Chiang Welcome Him at the Airport</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Marshal Marshall, who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon, flew to Nanjing with General Wedemeyer at 2:00 PM yesterday to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. Several hours before leaving Shanghai, Marshall held an important meeting with top US military officials at the US military headquarters in the Construction Building. Marshall's stay in Shanghai totaled 24 hours. Before his departure, strict security was temporarily enforced from Sichuan Road to Jiangwan Road, as well as within four to five miles of Jiangwan Airport, guarded by Chinese and American military police. After Marshall's arrival in Shanghai, the US military here placed great hopes on him. One US military officer wished: "May China be safe and well, and may America be safe and well."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] Mayor Qian Dajun, accompanied by US Ambassador to China General Marshall and Chief of Staff General He Yingqin, flew to Nanjing yesterday afternoon to meet Chairman Chiang and discuss everything. Mayor Kai is scheduled to return to Shanghai within days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang and US Special Envoy to China, Five-Star General Marshall, shook hands and exchanged greetings at the dusty Nanjing Airport at 3:15 PM today, marking the prelude to their initial historic talks. After their first meeting, Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall, together with Madame Chiang, drove to a tea party. Many believed that Chairman Chiang would, according to official custom, await the special envoy at his official residence in the city. However, Special Envoy Marshall, after a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Shanghai, stepped out of the gleaming C-54 aircraft. Just two minutes later, a large black sedan drove into the airport, and Chairman Chiang appeared, wearing a long, grassy-green military hat, leaving a deep impression. Marshall, in military uniform and wearing his five stars, saw Chairman Chiang. Both smiled and stepped forward, exchanging greetings and shaking hands warmly. Special Envoy Marshall said to Chairman Chiang's Chief of Staff and acting interpreter, General Shang Zhen, "Please tell His Excellency the Chairman that I am deeply honored." Chairman Chiang replied, "Welcome to Nanjing." This was the first meeting between Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall since the Cairo Conference. Madame Chiang, wearing an elegant brown otter fur coat, remained in the back seat of the car for about five minutes. Then, Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall, along with General Wedemeyer, the commander of the US military in China who had arrived on the same flight, walked to the car. Both Marshall and Wedemeyer shook hands with Madame Chiang. Madame Chiang sat between Chairman Chiang and the Special Envoy, and the car drove to the official residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, surrounded by red walls, where talks began.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman and Madame Chiang quietly arrived in a black sedan just as the plane carrying Special Envoy Marshall landed at the airport. They sat in the car while the welcoming party and photographers focused on the hatch of Marshal Marshall's plane. As he disembarked, shook hands with the welcoming party, and was surrounded by reporters, Chief of Staff Shang Zhen suddenly announced loudly, "Chairman Chiang has arrived!" Marshal Marshall was greatly excited upon hearing this and quickly walked towards the Chairman's car. Approaching the car, the Chairman alighted and shook hands with Marshal Marshall, repeatedly saying "Good, good, good" in Chinese. Marshal Marshall expressed his deep gratitude for the Chairman's hospitality and offered his best wishes. The airport security was provided by four truckloads of guards. Before Marshal Marshall's plane arrived, the US Air Force had been monitoring intelligence from the observation tower, appearing quite tense. After the plane arrived, everyone was happy and relaxed.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Special Envoy Marshall may go to Chongqing tomorrow with Chairman Chiang. It is reported that Marshall's office in Chongqing will be located in the US Embassy, and his residence will be No. 14 Jialing New Village, the former residence of General Wedemeyer. These two locations are very close to each other, both situated on a hillside, overlooking the Jialing River, with beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang's headquarters held a tea party this afternoon, lasting 50 minutes. The hosts, Chairman and Madame Chiang, and distinguished guests Marshal Marshall, General Wedemeyer, and Acting Chargé d'Affaires Robertson, were joined by Commander-in-Chief He, Minister Wang, Chief of Staff Shang, and Advisor Zhang Pingqun, among others. Chairman Chiang first expressed his welcome to Marshal Marshall, saying that he had hoped Marshall could visit China after the war before the end of the war. Now that he had come, it was a wish come true. Marshal Marshall then responded with words of thanks and reiterated the friendship between China and the United States.</p>
<h3>Important Talks Held in Shanghai, May Go to Chongqing with the Chairman Today</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Before leaving Shanghai yesterday, Special Envoy Marshall went to the US military headquarters at around 9:00 AM to hold an important meeting, receiving a report from US military officer Gu. The meeting adjourned at noon. The night before, Special Envoy Marshall and General Wedemeyer had a separate meeting lasting more than two hours.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai, 21st] US Special Envoy to China General Marshall arrived in Shanghai yesterday and, without resting, flew to Nanjing this morning to meet Chairman Chiang and carry out his mission to promote comprehensive peace in China. All of China, and most of the people in the East, are eagerly expecting this famous American wartime general to bring about an end to the disputes between factions, and together lead the largest nation in the Far East onto the path of revival, unity, prosperity, and strength. After Marshall's departure, about thirty foreign reporters and photographers traveled in the tail of his plane. Upon arriving in Nanjing, Chairman and Madame Chiang, who had arrived from the troubled heart of Beiping, waited to meet Marshall. The welcoming mood in Shanghai for this five-star general still lingered. Marshall was deeply moved by the crowds in Shanghai welcoming him on the streets, but seemed experienced in bearing the heavy responsibilities he carried. At a reception in the Cathay Hotel, he chatted happily with leaders from military, political, business, academic, and media circles for three hours without tiring. After resting for a night, he was full of energy this morning, but did not want to reveal his aspirations, only saying, "There is nothing to say at the moment." Looking at the quiet battlefield in North China, and the National Army's slow entry into Shenyang, it is said that at least part of this is related to Marshall's trip. This is because the conflicting parties are all "marking time," watching to see what contributions Marshall's trip will bring. At this time, General Wedemeyer, the commander of the US military in China, made a special broadcast to his subordinates, saying that the US military's stay in China would be longer than expected. Whether this coincidence with Marshall's arrival in Shanghai is related is unknown, but it is certain that all parties attach importance to it. At the same time, the reaction among the US military was, "We have to wait here until the war is over. The only person who won't send Marshall is to arrange for us to go home."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st] Amid frequent reports of renewed and intensified conflicts between the Nationalists and Communists in North China, the historic meeting between Chairman Chiang and General Marshall opened here tonight. Both China and the United States are looking forward to the outcome of this consultation in order to find a solution to China's internal disputes. In addition, the number and duration of US troops remaining in China, and the extent to which the National Government can obtain military and economic assistance from the United States, are all issues that remain to be resolved. It is generally believed that the primary issue that China wants to discuss with General Marshall is the transportation of more troops to the north.</p>
<h3>Chen Shaokuan Discusses Naval Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Admiral Chen Shaokuan, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, in response to reporters' requests today, explained the Navy's contributions during the war of resistance and answered the following questions: Regarding China's naval construction, Chen said: Before the war, our navy had 600,000 tons. In the future, doubling this, or even more, may not be enough. We are already listed as one of the four great powers, and the total tonnage of our navy in the future should naturally bear a quarter of the responsibility of the world's navies. To maintain coastal security, cruisers and destroyers will be needed in the initial stage. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States built more tonnage in two or three years, four times that of the United Kingdom. In view of the United States' experience, future shipbuilding and talent training will be fast. The United States helped us during the war, and we will certainly welcome their assistance in the future. Regarding naval education, Chen said: The naval academy is currently in Chongqing, with more than 200 students. It is currently exam time, and the water level in the Sichuan River is low, so it has not yet moved east. The school site is being surveyed in Nanjing and Shanghai. Naval students graduate in five years and must undergo two years of shipboard training. In the future, the naval academy should be expanded in line with our navy. In addition, 1,000 people from our country have been sent to the United States to study naval affairs, 200 have gone to the United Kingdom to receive ships, and another 800 are preparing to go. Chen also explained that only dozens of people were included in this time's reception and reorganization of the puppet navy. As for the intercepting of naval officers and soldiers, there are only 30,000 at present, and there are no British or American advisors among them. Chen hopes to build ships on our own, but still hopes that the allies will provide more assistance, and pointed out that modern navies must have aircraft carriers. He expressed optimism about naval construction, and when asked about the time frame, Chen replied: If there is a determination to build a navy, two years is enough.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 20th] After Japan's surrender, a total of 18,000 Chinese laborers who had been engaged in hard labor in Japan, in 14 batches, have returned to their homes via Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Increase Reconstruction and National Income, Five Unified Taxes Will Be Levied Next Year, Inspection Fees Will Also Be Collected for Exported Goods</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] It is reported that in order to increase revenue for reconstruction, the tax authorities plan to introduce unified taxes on the following items in the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946]: (1) Flour, (2) Tea, (3) Cement, (4) Furs, (5) Tin foil and superstitious paper. The budget figures are said to have been included in next year's budget, and implementation plans are currently being drafted.</p>

The fees are as follows: Based on a quintal [100 kg] unit, raw silk is 7,200 yuan per quintal, pig bristles are 600 yuan per quintal, tung oil is 165 yuan per quintal, and pig casings are 126 yuan per quintal.</p>
<h3>Following Talks with Marshall, Wedemeyer Decides to Retain US Troops in China to Assist in Transporting National Army to Recovered Areas</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] General Wedemeyer announced yesterday on a Shanghai radio station that, in view of President Truman's statement on China policy, the return of US troops from the China theater will be delayed. It is said that after talks with Marshal Marshall, it has been decided to retain US troops to assist the Chinese government in transporting Japanese nationals back to their country, transporting the National Army to recovered areas, protecting US property, and organizing a US volunteer military advisory group.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 20th] According to sources close to Chairman Chiang, the Chairman does not seem willing to accept any direct US assistance to deal with the Communists, believing that this would provoke war with the Soviet Union. They believe that the National Government can deal with the Communists without external force. It is said that Chairman Chiang is prepared to accept the Communist Party's demands, except for the issue of unified army management, because the Chairman insists that China has only one army, and the Communist Party is unwilling to give up control of its army. Neutral observers praised President Truman's message on China policy, and pointed out that the recent US statement is the culmination of advice to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to end their disputes, but the stubborn attitude of the Communist Party has prevented a peaceful resolution of the differences between the two sides.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Detailed Instructions on What to Build and What to Reform in Beiping, Auctioning off Japanese and Puppet Assets to Develop the City</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] After arriving in Beiping, Chairman Chiang gave instructions on general reception and reconstruction work, especially regarding the resumption of enemy and puppet factories. He personally ordered the municipal government to draft a plan within three days and actively prepare for resumption. It is reported that the municipal government's Public Works Bureau has drafted this plan, dividing the received factories into those that can be resumed immediately based on their equipment, raw materials, and capital requirements, those that are too damaged and need to be priced and sold, and those that have no value for resumption, and has made a form to submit to the Enemy and Puppet Industry Administration for approval.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] During his visit to Beiping, in addition to listening to reports and giving instructions on military and political affairs in North China, Chairman Chiang personally visited various agencies and important scenic areas for detailed inspections. For all matters that need to be built or reformed, whether major issues such as urban construction or minor issues such as street cleaning, he gave timely instructions to the responsible departments to pay attention based on his observations. On the morning of the 12th, he went to Zhongnanhai Beiping Military Camp for inspection and climbed Jingshan for sightseeing. On the morning of the 13th, he visited the Forbidden City, inspected the Forbidden City Museum and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall, and had lunch in the Jiangxuexuan Palace. On the morning of the 14th, he went to Biyun Temple in Xishan to pay respects to Premier Sun Yat-sen's clothing and burial mound. At noon, he inspected the Headquarters of the 11th War Zone, and in the afternoon he inspected the Municipal Government. On the morning of the 18th, he inspected the Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters and the Youth Corps.</p>
<p>Regarding urban construction, the Chairman listened to reports from Director Li and Mayor Xiong that construction could not be carried out due to lack of funds. The Chairman personally ordered the special commissioners to allocate 20% of the proceeds from the auction of received and seized Japanese and puppet assets to the municipal government specifically for construction purposes. In the future, any enemy and puppet materials discovered will also be handed over to the municipal government to develop the city.</p>
<p>Regarding transportation, the Chairman ordered the Wartime Transportation Bureau to allocate more than 100 vehicles to the municipal government to be converted into public buses to facilitate citizen transportation. Regarding the livelihood of public educators, the Chairman, noting that the salaries of municipal public educators and police officers were meager and their lives were difficult, ordered the municipal government and food authorities to continue allocating food rations until February of next year. After inspecting scenic temples, the Chairman gave instructions to reorganize and reform them. For example, in temples that display ancient Chinese musical instruments, the Chairman, fearing that they would be lost due to age, ordered the responsible authorities to assign young people to assist in their management. In Zhongnanhai, there were employee residences or rented houses of a few citizens. The Chairman, noting that they were unsightly and difficult to keep clean, ordered them to be moved out separately. Various public recreation areas and scenic historical sites had tea seats for tourists to rest, but they were simple and unclean. The Chairman ordered the responsible authorities to renovate them.</p>
<p>Regarding city appearance, the Chairman personally ordered the municipal government to remove shantytowns in various streets, vendors on pedestrian walkways, and merchants in the city gate barbicans within a time limit, as they obstructed traffic and were unsightly. The standard clocks on important streets were originally intended to facilitate citizens. Those that can be repaired should be repaired quickly, and those that cannot be repaired should be removed immediately. During his eight days in Beiping, the Chairman was concerned about all aspects of the city, leaving no detail unattended. The entire North China region, which had been controlled, oppressed, exploited, and ravaged by the enemy for more than a decade, was already lethargic and lifeless. The ancient saying "Yan and Zhao are full of generous and tragic singers" was rarely encountered in contacts with people from all walks of life in Beiping in the past three months. The phenomenon of bowing and obeying was everywhere.</p>
<p>The Chairman's visit was undoubtedly a stimulant for the people of North China in spirit, restoring their self-confidence. In all aspects, there was a thriving atmosphere. The harvest was so great that it cannot be described in words or statistically measured.</p>
<h3>New French Ambassador Arrives in Cairo and Will Proceed to Chongqing to Take Office</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] The new French Ambassador, Mr. Meyrier, arrived in Cairo on the 16th and, after a brief stay, flew to China. It is heard that Sino-French negotiations will enter a decisive stage as soon as Ambassador Meyrier arrives in China. The reason why negotiations between the two sides have not made significant progress in the past is that the various agreements signed between Vichy France and Japan during the Japanese invasion of China have added to Japan's responsibility for aggression, resulting in considerable disputes over the compensation for the significant political, economic, and military losses suffered by China. As for other issues such as France opening the coastal defense as a free port and the joint management of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, France has long made clear statements.</p>
<h3>Part of the Received Enemy and Puppet Factories Allocated to Private Operation, Ministry of Economic Affairs Formulates Priority Measures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] It is reported that in order to reward and support factories that engaged in production work in the rear during the War of Resistance and achieved results, the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to allocate some of the received enemy and puppet factories to private operation, except for those designated to be operated by the state. This principle has been drafted and submitted for approval. The content is roughly as follows: All factories that moved inland, engaged in production work during the War of Resistance, made significant contributions to the War of Resistance, and suffered war losses, have the right to request priority allocation.</p>
<h3>McNutt Returns to the Philippines Tomorrow, Gave a Speech to Reporters in Shanghai Yesterday, Advocating Economic Ties between China and the Philippines</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] US High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt plans to leave Shanghai for the Philippines tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon, McNutt emphasized at a reception for reporters: The relationship between China and the Philippines in commerce and economy should have further connections. I came to Shanghai this time to take this opportunity to discuss various issues regarding China-Philippines commerce and economy with Chinese social leaders. Before the war, the industrial, commercial, and financial circles of Shanghai invested heavily in the Philippines. I very much hope that this investment can continue. I also hope that the Philippines can become a central point of exchange for Sino-US commerce. People in the Philippines are very interested in China. There are more than 100,000 overseas Chinese doing business in the Philippines. Eight or nine out of ten retail businesses are run by overseas Chinese. The Chinese residents in the Philippines are frugal and hardworking. In the past, Filipinos discriminated against overseas Chinese businessmen, and political leaders criticized the so-called "influence of the Chinese" in many ways. I want to declare that I am very opposed to this kind of racial concept. Under the Principle of People's Livelihood, the claim that "the Philippines should belong to Filipinos" should not exist. China and the Philippines suffered significant sacrifices in the war. In the future, they should strive for economic ties as allies. McNutt also said that he had important discussions with General MacArthur in Tokyo and plans to discuss military issues with General Wedemeyer, Commander of US Forces in the China Theater.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] US High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt said yesterday: The Philippines has suffered great damage and cannot be restored in a short time. He also said: The Americans hope to make the Filipinos officially independent on July 14, 1946. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has allocated US$2 million as a fund for the restoration of the Philippines. As for the Filipinos who cooperated with the Japanese during the Japanese occupation, they have been formally tried.</p>
<h3>Government and Communist Party to Negotiate Next Week, Political Consultative Conference Agricultural Circles Will Participate</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] Negotiations between the government and the Communist Party will be extended to next week because the Communist Party representatives are not yet ready for the content of the negotiations. The date of the Political Consultative Conference is difficult to announce until negotiations between the government and the Communist Party have reached another level. Most of the representatives to the Political Consultative Conference have already been internally determined. It is heard that there is a lack of agricultural figures among the social elites, and requests are being made to the authorities to send representatives to participate.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi and Lei Zhen Host Banquet for Communist Party Representatives</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Participation Council, and Lei Zhen, Deputy Secretary-General (Wang Shijie of the Presidium was absent due to matters), hosted a banquet this afternoon for Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Deng Yingchao, Lu Dingyi, and their entourage. Councillors Chu Zhuanzheng, Huang Yanpei, and Zuo Shunsheng, who had previously visited Yan'an, were invited to participate, and Li Huang, Jiang Yong, and Wang Yunwu of the Presidium were invited to accompany them.</p>
<h3>Coastal Strongholds and Railways: Communist Forces Forced to Retreat; Demanding a Truce is a Tactic to Buy Time</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] San Francisco Radio on the 20th reports: Communist representative Zhou Enlai recently proposed to the Chinese government that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party immediately cease hostilities unconditionally to facilitate the convening of a political consultative conference.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Chongqing Dispatch, 21st] On the day Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Shanghai, a Communist spokesperson proposed an unconditional cessation of hostilities. The government criticized this proposal as diplomatic rhetoric. The Communist spokesperson reiterated today that this proposal would be issued in writing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beijing Dispatch, 21st] It is believed here that the Communist army's proposal for an unconditional truce is a symbol of the weakening of the Communist position in North and Northeast China. A month or two ago, Yan'an refused to consider truce proposals. At that time, the Communist army was advancing rapidly into Inner Mongolia, had entered Zhangjiakou, and controlled railway and highway traffic in North China and southern Manchuria. The Communist army's position is no longer as favorable as it was then. The area of recovered railway and highway traffic in North China is also gradually expanding. National Army reinforcements have arrived in the Tianjin area to organize and advance along the railways. Advised by the Soviet Union, the Communist army in the Northeast has withdrawn from several locations. The National Army is moving towards Jiyang and has occupied Huludao. Foreign observers here believe that the evolution of the situation seems to favor the central government and say that the strength of the Communist army must have been overestimated. The Communist army is being forced to retreat from coastal strongholds and railways in an orderly manner. According to the opinion of foreign observers here, this attempt to demand a truce is actually a tactic to buy time. Foreign observers suspect that the Communist army's demand for a truce is aimed at Marshal Marshall. Regardless of how good the Communist army's guerrilla warfare skills may be, they can hardly hope to confront the regular National Army on the battlefield. The Communist Party is at a disadvantage both politically and militarily. Chairman Chiang's visit here has dealt the Communist Party a political blow. The Chairman has clearly won popular support among the people from all walks of life, and the public support he received for dealing with the issue of officials' oppression has dealt a serious setback to the Communist Party's position here.</p>

<h3>A Glimmer of Dawn Gradually Appears in the White Mountains and Black Waters; Administrative Takeover to Begin; Mayors of Dalian and Other Cities Depart for Their Posts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing Dispatch, 20th] The work of taking over industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast has begun with the entry of the National Army into the Northeast. Hu Ankai and 18 other personnel from the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs have arrived in Jinzhou in three batches. Hu's initial report has arrived here. According to the report, there are power plants, synthetic fuel plants, pulp mills, machine factories, spinning mills, etc., near Jinzhou, and they are quite large in scale. During the period of Soviet military occupation, the equipment of each factory was not moved. Before the Communist army withdrew, it was unable to destroy these huge factories. Only a few machines were penetrated by their rifle bullets, but they did not cause substantial damage. The takeover work will begin within days. Two of the spinning mills will be taken over and put into operation by the Ministry of Military Affairs to rush to make clothing and bedding for the National Army. The thousand technical personnel for the takeover of industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast, whom Sun Yueqi had recruited in Chongqing, were prevented by transportation difficulties. It was decided to first select 400 people, who are scheduled to depart from Chongqing by special ship to Shanghai on the 21st, and then go north. The industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast are vast and extensive, and these few technical personnel alone cannot take over them. Therefore, the Chairman instructed that Japanese technical personnel be retained. However, the problem that may arise is whether the workers who have suffered under Japanese oppression will still be willing to work under the command of high-ranking Japanese personnel. Sun Yueqi, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Northeast, passed through the north previously. Because he was unable to immediately go to the Northeast to take over, he was ordered to concurrently head the Bureau for the Disposition of Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Pingjin area to sort out the chaotic mess of the past three months. When the Chairman visited Beijing, he was distressed that the takeover had stalled. He immediately ordered Sun to prepare a plan for the resumption of work in the factories of Pingjin within three days. The plan has now been submitted to the Chairman for review. The start of work should not be far off. However, it will be impossible for some factories to resume full production because their future products have no outlet or they lack raw materials.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing Dispatch, 20th] Our reporter recently learned from authoritative sources that there are no diplomatic issues regarding the takeover of the Northeast. The reason why the National Army has not yet airlifted to Changchun and Harbin is that the National Army in the north must maintain law and order in its original location. It is costly to transport the National Army in South China to the distant and cold Northeast, and it will take considerable time and preparation, such as the preparation of cold-weather clothing. Currently, administrative takeover work will precede the air transport of the National Army. Shenyang and Harbin will be the first cities we take over from the Soviet army. Dong Wenqi, the mayor of Shenyang, will fly with Zhang Jia'ao to Changchun on the 21st and then transfer to Shenyang to take over. Yang Chuo'an, the mayor of Harbin, and Shen Yi, the mayor of Dalian, will lead their municipal government personnel on the 22nd to fly to Changchun and then transfer to Harbin to go to their respective posts. Regarding the long-publicized issue of industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast, it is understood that the Soviet government has not made any suggestions to us. Marshal Malinovsky did mention the issue of war booty while in Changchun. Our side agreed that the Soviet side could transport its war booty back to its own country, and the two sides have not discussed this issue since then. As for the US statement that the US military can assist the National Army in entering the Northeast if necessary, a powerful figure said: "This is presumably a diplomatic posture of the US at the current stage. In fact, we have not made any requests to the US side." Looking out at the White Mountains and Black Waters, the fish-belly white of dawn is already visible. The long night of fourteen years is about to break.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing Dispatch, 20th] Zhang Jia'ao flew from Beijing to Beijing at 2:00 PM on the 20th. Chiang Ching-kuo did not come along. Zhang will fly to Changchun via Jinzhou on the 21st with Dong Wenqi, the mayor of Shenyang, and personnel from the Changchun Railway and the Central Bank. Also, the Changchun branch of the Central Bank is scheduled to open on the 22nd. A large batch of newly printed ten-yuan, fifty-yuan, and hundred-yuan circulating notes will be brought there by the Central Bank personnel tomorrow. The Jinzhou branch of the Central Bank may also open soon. The financial situation there is quite chaotic, and merchants and residents feel very inconvenienced. The establishment of a branch is very urgent.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Assists the Japanese People in Building a Democratic and Free Government; Removes All Obstacles in Accordance with the Potsdam Declaration; MacArthur Flatly Denies Rumors of His Retirement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo Special Dispatch, 21st] General MacArthur's headquarters recently ordered the abolition of all obstacles related to Japanese Shintoism in accordance with the Potsdam Conference Declaration. The purpose of MacArthur's move is to achieve the goals of the occupation forces as soon as possible and to assist Japan in forming a democratic government based on the free will of the people. The Allied Headquarters believes that all the regulations of Shintoism are the main factors that caused the Japanese people to become an aggressive country. The main points of the outline are education and guidance. The Japanese people, who used to live under the sword, now need assistance and leadership to achieve freedom. The current lack of leaders has prevented the Allied occupation from achieving full development. Educators and leaders with free thought have never been able to survive and develop in Japan. Almost all officials are people trained by the Bushido and the Black Dragon Society. They are full of feudal ideas and hold thorough aggressive views, which have made Japan an aggressive country. Currently, most of them have been imprisoned, allowing competitive Japanese political parties to rise and propose many plans to reform Japan. MacArthur has been working to give the Japanese people the principles of constitutional reform and the establishment of a new system of government as stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration and is striving to achieve them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo Dispatch, 21st] General MacArthur today flatly denied rumors that he would retire or resign. It is said that the purpose of his coming to Japan is to complete the tasks assigned to him by the Allied Conference, but not to hinder the implementation of American policies. Whether the Soviet Union will send troops to occupy Japan is not within his purview and should be left to the instructions of the Allied nations. However, the Soviet Union has never submitted a request to MacArthur's headquarters to send troops to Japan. It is understood that MacArthur insisted on a dissenting opinion regarding the Soviet Union's proposal to send troops to occupy Hokkaido alone. It is rumored that MacArthur has presented his personal opinion to the State Department, opposing Soviet participation in the control of Japan. Truman and the spokesman for the US State Department have denied the rumors that MacArthur threatened to resign because he did not want Soviet troops to participate in the occupation of Japan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo Dispatch, 21st] According to a report from the Tokyo correspondent of the American Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Tai, General MacArthur had discussed the issues of the occupation army and policies with the Soviet authorities. Today, when asked about this matter, MacArthur immediately and firmly denied it. He said, "This report is completely unfounded. I have denied the rumors twice this week. The previous rumor even said that I was planning to resign immediately. My task is to implement the policies of the US government. If Mr. Tai has indeed spread this rumor, then he has obviously been fooled by the street rumors in Tokyo."</p>
<p>Truman Expresses: He Has Not Heard of Marshal MacArthur Opposing Soviet Participation in Joint Control</p>
<p>[Reuter's Washington Dispatch, 21st] President Truman told the press yesterday that he was unaware of Marshal MacArthur's opposition to Soviet participation in the control of Japan. Tokyo Radio said that MacArthur had telegraphed the State Department that if the Soviet Union was allowed to participate in the occupation of Japan, he would resign. He had not heard anything about this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington Special Dispatch, 20th] The spokesman for the US State Department today denied the rumors that MacArthur did not want Soviet troops to participate in the occupation of Japan and would threaten to resign. The spokesman said that the State Department had not received any documents from MacArthur mentioning disagreements between the US and the Soviet Union. It is rumored that the disagreement between the US and the Soviet Union is on the number of Soviet troops participating in the occupation of Japan and the scope of the occupied areas. At the same time, US official sources said that the Soviet Union has not yet responded to the US proposal to invite the Soviet Union to send troops to Japan to jointly occupy Japan. The US proposal was contained in a note from the US to the Soviet Union, which stated that the US gave Australia the opportunity to send troops to occupy Japan alone and would be willing to allow Soviet troops to participate in joint occupation on the same basis.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington Dispatch, 20th] Tiege of the American Broadcasting Corporation broadcast from Tokyo that the Soviet Union will not send troops to Japan due to the disagreement between the Soviet Union and the Supreme Commander. Tiege said that the dispute between MacArthur and the Soviet Union is focused on which island the Soviet Union wants to occupy.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Equipment Still Concealed</p>
<p>[Reuter's Tokyo Dispatch, 21st] Today, the US Sixth Army announced that a patrol team of the US 24th Division on Shikoku Island discovered several unreported reinforced concrete fortifications along the coast and a large number of military supplies hidden in storage. Many rifles, cannons, and other equipment were found in a small school, which shows that despite repeated requests for reports, Japanese military equipment is still concealed. At the same time, the Sixth Army announced that on Shikoku Island, 1,000 Japanese men and women attacked a camp that was about to be abandoned. US guards fired shots to stop them, knocking down one person.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Tokyo Dispatch, 20th] Before his suicide, Fumimaro Konoe submitted a draft amendment to the Japanese Constitution to the Emperor on November 22 and then resigned from his position as Acting Minister of the Imperial Household. According to the Mainichi Shimbun, the original draft was very long, and it proposed to continue to retain the Emperor's political power, but to slightly reduce its scope. The original Japanese Constitution stated that the Emperor had the power to rule Japan. This clause was retained, but a sentence was added stating that the Emperor should exercise his powers with the assistance of all his subjects. Although the Emperor has the power to declare war, make peace, and conclude treaties with other countries, he must first obtain the approval of the parliament. This is the most important amendment in the draft. The draft also proposed to establish a committee in the parliament to pass various emergency decrees issued by Japan. According to custom, if these decrees are not rejected by the next parliament, they will become law. During the military period, various emergency decrees were often abused. The draft also advocated reforming the Japanese House of Peers, placing the army and navy under the management of the government, and allowing the Japanese parliament to convene or dissolve itself. Until now, only the Emperor had the power to convene or dissolve the parliament. It is understood that after reading the draft, the Emperor gave it to the cabinet and instructed the Japanese government to consider amending the constitution based on this plan. There is still no notification from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Police General, Amakasu, Commits Suicide</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo Special Dispatch, 20th] Amakasu, the former Japanese military police general who shot and killed the famous Japanese anarchist Osugi Sakae after the Great Kanto Earthquake in Yokohama in 1923, is said to have committed suicide in our country's Northeast. Since the Mukden Incident, he had been working in the special service agency established by the Japanese army there. Recently, according to retired Japanese military officers returning from the Northeast, after Japan surrendered, Amakasu committed suicide with a pistol in front of a large group of employees of the Manchuria Film Corporation.</p>
<p>Japan's Food Problem Can Be Solved Without Great Concern</p>
<p>[Reuter's Tokyo Dispatch, 21st] Summers, Director of the Public Health and Welfare Group of the Supreme Command of the United Nations, today criticized Japanese government officials for making dangerous statements about Japan's food problem in order to obtain American assistance. The food obtained by the Japanese this winter will be more than that of the defeated European countries, and there is no danger of starvation. Although the food situation is obviously tight in winter, food shortages in urban areas may be unavoidable, but the amount of rice rationed by the Supreme Command of the United Nations shows that there is sufficient food to provide each person with 1,500 calories of energy per day. This ration can continue until April and May of next year. According to previous estimates by the Japanese, they could get at most 1,375 calories and 41 centimeters of protein per day.</p>
<h3>Rear Admiral Arleigh Arrives in Japan</h3>

<h3>Surplus American Merchant Ships Should Be Supplied to China</h3>
<p>American Congressman Judd's Advocacy</p>
<p>[Reuter's Washington Dispatch, 20th] Congressman Judd, who served as a medical advisor in China, urged the US today to quickly supply China with surplus merchant ships, saying that this is "an important step in solving China's political and economic difficulties. The lack of transportation makes it impossible to promote post-war reconstruction and makes it impossible for Chairman Chiang to establish a broadly based coalition government. This is what we are working hard to urge. Railways, highways, and shipping have been paralyzed by the destruction of the war. The US has now supplied Britain with 400 surplus cargo ships and the Soviet Union with 150 ships, while China has only received three ships, and another five are still under construction."</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassies and Consulates in the United States Have Been Taken Over by the US Government</h3>

<h3>After Several Exploratory Talks, the Suspicions of the Three Powers Can Be Eliminated; The Soviet Union Demands the Return of Lost Territory of Georgia</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow Dispatch, 21st] Well-informed sources here announced today that after the exploratory talks held by the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the unity of the three countries is even greater than before the meeting. It is hoped that some doubts will disappear. The sixth day of the meeting was the 66th birthday of Marshal Stalin. Based on reports from foreign countries, the situation is analyzed as follows: (1) There is now a strong feeling that the meeting will have some results, or even better than originally hoped, but it seems that every dispute among the three powers cannot be resolved in the meeting. (2) US Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin do not want to exaggerate the hopes of the British and American people. (3) The three foreign ministers have no intention of controlling the United Nations organization, but the three powers cooperated closely during the war, and they can continue to do their best through this cooperation in the future. (4) If the United Nations organization can be expected to handle all matters, then there is no need for each country to have ambassadors and ministers. (5) The Five Foreign Ministers Committee, including the three foreign ministers and the foreign ministers of China and France, has no intention of dissolving it. However, the United Nations organization should immediately begin to take over some of the work of the committee.</p>
<p>[Reuter's Moscow Dispatch, 21st] The attention of the Moscow Conference seems to have shifted from Iran to Turkey. Yesterday, most Soviet newspapers published a letter from two Georgian scholars to a newspaper in Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Republic, demanding that Turkey return the land seized from the Georgian Republic. The Georgian Republic is Stalin's hometown. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes began studying this request yesterday. The letter stated that "the current Turkish authorities are changing the place names of Georgia, demolishing historical monuments, and forcing residents to move to distant places. During the war against Germany, Turkey invaded Georgian territory by helping the German Empire. Today, it must be returned to the Georgian people." Moscow diplomatic circles are paying close attention to this move. On Wednesday night, when Stalin met with Bevin and Byrnes, it was said that he discussed issues of "mutual concern," but this was only a draft proposal of a diplomatic nature. After this meeting, the issue of Georgia immediately attracted attention from all sides. Regarding the situation of the Moscow Conference, the official side remains silent, but it is understood that the atmosphere is still very friendly and that work has been intensified.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow Dispatch, 20th] Soviet official newspapers clearly stated today that the Soviet Union is demanding that Turkey cede 55,000 square miles of land on its Black Sea coast adjacent to the Soviet port of Batumi.

<h3>Chinese in Hong Kong Hope for Hong Kong's Return to China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 20th] Hong Kong has been under British rule for a century. As people in Southeast Asia rise up against white rule, this small island is the only place without rebellion. There are neither independence battles nor mass rallies shouting for the expulsion of foreigners. Order prevails everywhere. Queen's Road is as peaceful as Piccadilly Circus in London and as crowded as Times Square in New York. The Chinese often set off firecrackers, saying they have the power to ward off evil, but there is no sound of guns. In fact, most Chinese in Hong Kong would like the British to leave and return the island to China. A Chinese person who received higher education said: "In our hearts, everyone hopes that Hong Kong will return to China, because we are all Chinese people. Currently, we would rather maintain the status quo for the time being." The British obviously have no intention of giving up Hong Kong, but the fact that they can govern Hong Kong so peacefully is due to the silent assistance of most Chinese.</p>

<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>The County Arbitrarily Issues a Huge Amount of Currency</p>
<p>The newly appointed Magistrate of Songjiang County, Huang Chaoren, recently printed 250 million yuan of currency at the Cheng Zhang Printing House, with denominations of 1,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan, and 4,000 yuan. All of the currency will be used to purchase military provisions. The currency will be signed and stamped by the County Magistrate, the Director of the Military Provisions Purchasing Office, and the Chairman of the Rice Industry Association (the Chairman is currently recuperating in Shanghai). The currency will be used interchangeably with legal tender until February 15th, 1946, when it can be exchanged for legal tender. The public is horrified. During the Anti-Japanese War, Songjiang suffered severely due to being on the front lines. It has yet to recover. How can it bear this heavy burden? Various Songjiang hometown associations in Shanghai, as well as Zhang Shutong, Zhou Xuewen, and others, have sent telegrams to the provincial authorities and the Commissioner's Office, ordering them to stop the action to alleviate the people's suffering and avoid disrupting the currency system.</p>

In addition, the United States has paid off all its dues to the United Nations. In this regard, Congress has made an initial and powerful contribution to promoting the full participation of the United States in this new world organization.

<h3>Dian River Flows Backwards, Ripples on Emerald Lake: Recent Developments in Kunming</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zhang Jun</p>
<p>Winter Solstice is approaching, but the climate in Kunming is still like autumn. Autumn in Kunming is not only eventful but also colorful, especially busy for newspaper reporters. Don't say the autumn scenery is good, and write about the sounds of autumn coming and going, leaving what traces, what changes, repercussions, and consequences on Wuhua Mountain, on Emerald Lake Road, and outside the Great Western Gate.</p>
<p>The Yunnan Provincial Government has undergone two major reorganizations, with five provincial committee members and four department heads replaced. The Kunming Municipal Government has undergone one reorganization, with three bureau chiefs replaced. Personnel changes in various counties are also routine events in officialdom.</p>
<p>In this short autumn, several large-scale military organizations were abolished, and a large number of unemployed soldiers were added. Commander Du Yuming completed the reorganization of the Yunnan Provincial Government in Kunming in mid-autumn and has since been doing well outside Shanhaiguan, leading people to say that Du is "lucky." Commander Guan, after taking office in Kunming, was also colorful for only 39 days before "taking responsibility" and leaving due to the student protests. Recently in Kunming,</p>
<p>There are open robberies in the downtown area. Gunshots are often heard at night, and people are panicked. The reception center for scattered soldiers and vagrants announced that it is overcrowded. The "international routes" have lost their patrons and are like wandering gulls. Factories and guest houses are successively being downsized and closed. Factory owners are running around calling for help, and a large number of employees are wandering the streets. In this "city that never sleeps," with its 280,000 people, various audible and silent changes are taking place rapidly. If you are willing to accept the stimulation of these sounds on an autumn night, you will feel excitement, tension, silence, hidden worries, sadness, and the feeling of not knowing whether to laugh or cry. The expression of this autumn is particularly significant. These events and changes are inevitably produced after the war. However, we cannot ignore the impact of personnel matters. Here, I will describe the outline of a few shots taken by the reporter.</p>
<p>Wuhua Mountain: One Welcome, One Farewell</p>
<p>Former Chairman of Yunnan Province, Long Yun, served in Yunnan for eighteen years. On October 3rd, the gunfire caused by the reorganization of the provincial government was "rarely seen by the general public" in Kunming (quoting Chairman Lu). The reaction produced by the strangeness stabilized after a period of time. Former Chairman Long flew to Chongqing by special plane. On the day Deputy Chairman Li arrived at the provincial government to take office, national flags were flying in the urban area, and security was tight from Wuhua Mountain to the airfield. Dozens of small chartered vehicles "farewelling the old" sped through the city, and no one thought of setting off firecrackers to welcome the new. On December 1st, Chairman Lu arrived at the provincial government to take office, and national flags were flying in the city again. However, when Deputy Chairman Li was sent down the mountain (Wuhua Mountain) by the provincial government band, firecrackers were set off everywhere in the city, costing more than ten million yuan. These are the two recent intermezzos.</p>
<p>Pastoral City, Oriental Switzerland</p>
<p>During this period of welcoming the new and sending off the old, many colorful materials were added to the newspapers in Kunming, which may be "rarely seen" by some people. However, based on these materials, we can see what traces were left in this changing process, what style was expressed, and what consequences occurred. At the beginning of his tenure, Deputy Chairman Li announced the three principles and six guidelines of governing in a tea party at the Provincial Party Headquarters. On December 1st, when Li welcomed Chairman Lu to take office for the last time as Deputy Chairman, he said in his speech: "I was ordered to return to Yunnan in a hurry and serve as Deputy Chairman. For the past two months, I have been working diligently day and night, never daring to slack off." This is a fact.</p>
<p>It is said that since the day he took office as Deputy Chairman, he worked 16 hours a day. From design to execution to assessment, the entire three-link system required him to do everything himself. During his 55 days in Wuhua Mountain, he drafted a draft of the Yunnan Governance Program, attended more than 30 gatherings or meetings, and delivered a 30,000-word speech (according to a reporter's estimate). In his speech, after advocating vigor, he continued to advocate integrity, promote work competitions, and ban smoking, gambling, and prostitution to complete local autonomy. For Kunming, he hoped to "turn Kunming into the Oriental Switzerland and a pastoral city" (October 27th speech). For the party, government, military, and people, he advocated the integration of the four. Regarding the Wuhua he resided in, he said: "Wuhua Mountain is the seat of the provincial government and is owned by the people, not by any individual or any government. The world belongs to the people of the world, and only the virtuous can live in it" (October 22nd speech). In order to "diligently seek public opinion," he placed opinion boxes at the gates of Kunming. In order to "try democracy," he implemented public elections for the head of the general affairs section in the Department of Civil Affairs. In order to respect the elders, he served rice to the elders at the Kunming County Council meeting. These facts are enough to show that he "never dared to slack off." At the same time, the voices of all sectors of society were playing out in the background.</p>
<p>On December 1st, Chairman Lu took office. In his inaugural speech, we can see another style of Lu: (1) He advocated that "governing does not require much talk." "If one is not careful in one's words, it is easy to lose the government's credibility, not only making individuals despised by the people, but also making the people despise the government." (2) Regarding the "past righteous governance" during former Chairman Long's tenure, "we should follow the old ways." (3) Currently, "the most important task is to maintain local security and strive for social stability." Chairman Lu's inauguration ceremony was completed at 10:20 a.m. on the 1st. The Southwest Associated University had a grenade incident at 11:00 a.m. Lu issued a letter to the students of various schools on the 10th, saying: "Unfortunately, on the day of my inauguration, the Kunming student protests turned into a tragic case." Lu took office at the turn of autumn and winter, first welcoming this more complex and difficult problem. What caused the problem? Some say: "The gift of autumn."</p>
<p>Emerald Lake Road: Guan Leaves, Huo Comes</p>
<p>On November 18th, a grand banquet was held on Wuhua Mountain to bid farewell to Du Yuming as he went to the Northeast and welcome Guan Linwei to Kunming. Deputy Chairman Li said in his speech: "The waters of Yunnan flow backwards. Foreign military and government officials in Yunnan often leave and return." This refers to the exchange of positions between Guan and Du. Guan had been stationed in southern Yunnan for many years, and the central government had initially appointed Guan as the security commander of the nine provinces in the Northeast. Therefore, most of his subordinates had already gathered in Chongqing to await orders. Later, Guan was announced as the commander of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison, and he rushed back to Kunming to actively prepare for the establishment of the headquarters. Initially, they did not even have cooks. In just half a month, the headquarters was officially established on Emerald Lake on November 1st. Before Guan was sworn in, there were 11 robbery cases in the city within half a month. People were robbed of their property and then killed. The people were angry and panicked. However, within 20 days, all the cases were solved. This achievement established some faith in the headquarters. From November 1st, Guan actively promoted his plan to maintain security, including checking household registrations, registering self-defense firearms, controlling public and private vehicles, cracking down on scattered soldiers and vagrants, and implementing district-based garrison. On November 24th, the headquarters issued Announcement No. 6, stating that "Kunming's security has been stabilized." However, on the night of November 25th, the garrison suddenly released a news release stating that "A bandit alarm occurred near Baini Slope outside the West Gate of the city at around 7:00 p.m. on the 25th. The local garrison rushed to catch them after receiving the report. The bandits fired their guns and fled into the darkness." The reporter was also outside the West Gate at the time and heard the sound of hand grenades and machine guns, indicating that the bandits were not weak.</p>
<p>School Security Suddenly Becomes Unstable</p>
<p>From November 1st to the 24th, the security of the city was peaceful, but from the 26th, the security of the school suddenly became unstable. On December 1st, a hand grenade case occurred at the Associated University, killing and injuring more than 20 people. Guan personally went to the scene of the incident that afternoon to investigate and console the injured students. Chief of Staff Wu of the Garrison Headquarters gave a speech on the 4th, reporting on Guan's visit, stating: "At that time, my colleagues were afraid of accidents and repeatedly stopped him from going, but our Commander-in-Chief was motivated by a sense of responsibility and compassion and insisted on going. When he returned to the headquarters, his colleagues saw that his expression was depressed, which had not been seen in the fierce battles of the past." On December 7th, Guan telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting punishment, saying that the occurrence of this tragic case was all due to his responsibility for security and his failure to take precautions beforehand. He was willing to "bear all the punishment himself." Guan flew to Chongqing on the 9th, and the central government announced on the 10th that Guan would be dismissed and await further action. The position of Commander of the Garrison was assigned to Huo Kuizhang as an acting commander.</p>
<p>Acting Commander Huo arrived in Kunming from Chongqing on the 7th. As of the 15th, although he had not yet gone to the Emerald Lake headquarters to formally take office, in reality, he had taken on the garrison responsibilities of Guan. Huo was a strong general in the counter-offensive in western Yunnan and had been stationed in Yunnan for many years. He had also served as the acting Director of the Youth Army and Commander of the Sixth Army in Chongqing. Now that he is back in Kunming, the reporter cannot help but think of the phrase "the waters of Yunnan flow backwards."</p>
<p>Outside the Great Western Gate: A Combination of Sound and Color</p>
<p>At the turn of autumn and winter, there was a combination of sound and color outside the Great Western Gate. This incident occurred on the evening of November 25th and has not subsided to this day. In the past three weeks, the reporter has often heard students' shouts, debates, protests, scoldings, and speeches. He has also heard professors' exhortations, protests, "rioters'" shouts, sounds of bullets, condolences from people in society, and the cries of young men and women. In the past three weeks, the reporter has often seen colorful slogans, catchphrases, leaflets, cartoons, and various printed, lithographed, mimeographed, and handwritten propaganda materials distributed in schools, in the city, on blackboards, on walls, on buses, and in the hearts of many people. Various sounds interacted and stimulated, and various colors interacted and influenced, which ended the scene of sound and color combined. (Sent from Kunming on December 17, 1945)</p>
<h3>The Birth of the Buddhist Reorganization Committee</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Air Dispatch) The Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Buddhist Association is scheduled to be established in Chongqing on the 22nd of this month. Master Taixu has specially written an article elaborating on its significance. The original text is as follows: "Since the outbreak of the full-scale Anti-Japanese War, Beijing and Shanghai fell in quick succession, and the Chinese Buddhist Association was suspended. The regions of the eastern, southern, northern, and western provinces and counties were gradually blocked and inaccessible. Buddhist temples, monks, and believers, like the general populace, suffered under the enemy and puppet regimes, with deep pain unspoken. The Buddhist monks and disciples in the western, southern, and northwestern rear areas, due to the lack of leadership from a national Buddhist organization, though each went its own way forming monk rescue teams, Buddhist wounded soldier慰勞 teams, and engaging in nursing, propaganda, fundraising, donations, and responding to the call for educated youth to join the army, participate in guerrilla warfare, and aid refugees, these actions serving the nation and the people failed to become a universal and systematic organization, receiving sufficient attention and assistance from the central government and the provincial and regional governments and society. Instead, temples were seen as docile and easily bullied, suffering endless exploitation, oppression, and extortion from local tyrants, evil gentry, corrupt officials, falsely claiming military service contributions and various illegal and tyrannical demands. Despite the central government's repeated grand decrees of protection, the suffering of those below could not reach the ears of those above, and the benevolent virtue from above could not reach those below, accumulating into a tragic resentment between the government and the people. In provinces and counties with Buddhist associations, each made local rescues, but their own organizations were often not sound, and lacking a central national church to advocate and guide them, they suffered even more than the average person. Now, fortunately, the nation's war of resistance is victorious and the nation's reconstruction begins. The Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Interior Affairs have presented to the Executive Yuan the establishment of the 'Chinese Buddhist Association Reorganization Committee,' aiming to convene a national Buddhist representative conference within half a year or a year, to strengthen and improve the organization of the 'Chinese Buddhist Association' and the 'Buddhist branch associations of various provinces and counties,' adapting to the needs of the new China, which has leaped to become one of the four major powers in the international arena, so that Buddhism may also become the new Buddhism of the new China. (Omission) Buddhist comrades throughout the country should abandon grievances and cultivate friendship, forming a sincere gathering, a harmonious union, and swiftly seize the opportune moment to spread the Dharma throughout the country and the world! It is hoped that virtuous people throughout the country and in the government and the public, and those in the world who revere truth and promote goodness, will all support and guide us!"</p>

<p>The Council of Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union has been convened in Moscow for nearly a week. During this week, the representatives of the three countries have been in frequent contact. Marshal Stalin has also returned from convalescing in the Black Sea region of southern Russia and has met with the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and the United States in Moscow. The meeting seems to be entering an important phase. Although the details of the meeting are kept strictly confidential, making it impossible to know the general agenda, it is certainly believable that the meeting, once convened, will discuss various issues of common interest to the three countries, especially the situation in the Far East. According to news from Moscow, Soviet newspapers have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the situation in Japan, China, and Vietnam. This suggests that the situation in the Far East is indeed one of the main topics of discussion for the three countries. While this may be speculation, it is not without reason.</p>
<p>Looking at the world situation, the Far East is currently filled with many dangerous elements, and the content of the problems is very complex. How the Far Eastern situation develops is not only related to the countries of the Far East but also affects the peace of the entire world. China is the first major country in the Far East to resist aggression and undoubtedly should have a voice in the handling of Far Eastern issues. However, today, as we watch the Council of Foreign Ministers convene in Moscow, and as the China issue may even be included in the agenda, our ambassador to the Soviet Union can only obtain some information from separate visits with the British and American foreign ministers. We really should feel ashamed and blame ourselves! Just think, in the current so-called Far Eastern situation, such as the issue of governing defeated Japan, the issue of handling the Korean situation, and the so-called national self-determination movements related to China, Vietnam, and even South Asia, which of these issues should not be of concern to China, and which of these issues can China ignore? At the time of the convening of the Council of Foreign Ministers, it was heard that issues related to other major powers would not be discussed, but since attention is now being paid to the Far Eastern situation, we, from the standpoint of the Chinese people, cannot help but say a few words.</p>
<p>The key to the Far Eastern situation lies not in how to govern defeated Japan or how to support the post-war reconstruction of China, but in how the major Allied nations take coordinated steps. Regarding the issue of post-war control of Japan, although the Soviet Union has refused to participate in the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, its principle of Allied joint control of Japan should be accepted by the Allied nations. The problem is not a difference of opinion in principle but a technical detail in execution. According to a Reuters report from Tokyo, General MacArthur, in view of the disagreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the issue of controlling Japan, has telegraphed the U.S. State Department that if he does not have full authority, he will resign. This so-called disagreement is not a matter of principle but a matter of execution. It is said that "the Soviet Union requested to send troops to Japan, but MacArthur only allowed the Soviet side to send one division; the Soviet Union wanted to occupy Hokkaido, but MacArthur rejected this request but allowed Soviet troops to be stationed in Kyushu." It can be seen that the United States and the Soviet Union do not have a dispute in principle regarding joint control of Japan, but rather in the aspect of execution. Now that the foreign ministers of the three countries are gathered in Moscow and are in frequent contact, it is possible to eliminate some misunderstandings and find an appropriate solution.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the Korean issue, the Korean Peninsula is originally mountainous and barren. Now the occupation zones of the US and Soviet armies have divided Korea into two, cutting the Korean people in half. These two occupation zones do not communicate with each other, which truly aggravates the suffering of the Korean people. Helping the Korean people to become independent and autonomous should be the common will of the US and the Soviet Union. It is believed that the current situation can be improved through sincere coordination.</p>
<p>The situation contrary to that in Korea is developing vigorously in various parts of South Asia. In Indonesia, there is the so-called Indonesian national independence movement, which often clashes with the occupying Allied forces. The same situation is also appearing in Vietnam. Regarding the Indonesian independence movement, it is said that there is manipulation by the Japanese within it, and their weapons are also obtained from the Japanese. To some extent, this movement seems to have been poisoned by the so-called "Greater East Asia" propaganda. Regardless of whether these rumors are reliable, in South Asia, the component that may have been poisoned by "Greater East Asia" is very high. In the past, the Japanese incited people under colonial rule. Although the Japanese have surrendered, there will inevitably be some remnants of their poison left behind, which is also possible. Therefore, the United Nations' attitude toward handling Asian national issues really should not adhere to the old imperialist conventions but should re-establish a new style. Otherwise, it will be impossible to justify itself with the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Declaration.</p>
<p>In China, since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, China has automatically added some restrictions to the exercise of its sovereignty. This is nothing more than expressing our hope for close international cooperation, hence the willingness to make self-sacrifices. However, since the signing of the treaty, all developments have not necessarily been as ideal as expected. To this day, our national army has not been able to enter Shenyang and Changchun very happily, and the news of these past few days has been particularly depressing. If China is allowed to handle the Communist issue internally, it is believed that a reasonable solution can be found through peaceful means. External interference can sometimes increase the factors of disputes. Now that President Truman has announced a clear policy, hoping that China will be peacefully unified under the leadership of the National Government and does not want any interference, and the foreign ministers of the three countries are gathering in Moscow, we believe that the situation in China will become clearer.</p>
<p>World War II originated from the Far Eastern issue. We must not allow a third world war to brew in the Far East again. The United Nations fought shoulder to shoulder against the enemy in the past. Today, as the enemy surrenders, they should unite to establish peace. The crux of the Far Eastern issue is not the difference in goals but the difficulty in execution. These difficulties are not insurmountable. How to overcome these difficulties depends on the close cooperation of all countries. The convening of the Council of Foreign Ministers in Moscow is sufficient to show that the three countries have a common demand for close cooperation, and the major countries other than the three should also have the opportunity to exchange opinions frankly and achieve consistency. Only in this way can all problems be easily solved.</p>

<h3>Public Bond Giants Emerge at High Prices, Foreign Shares Continue to Rise, Chinese Shares Initially Weak But Later Firm</h3>
<p>Public bonds opened with yesterday's report that the capital in Chongqing was still being drawn by lottery for repayment, leading to slight disappointment among some people. Type C fell from 800 yuan to 715 yuan. Northern dealers absorbed at low prices, and dealers took advantage of the situation to drive up prices. Chinese and foreign stocks were unusually popular, boosting buying interest significantly, and prices rose back to a high of 840 yuan. Zheng dealers saw the difference between miscellaneous brands widen, so they emerged at high prices. Dealers saw that the situation was difficult to sustain and scattered, leading to a lack of support. At the midday close, prices fell again to below 750 yuan. As a result, prices fell by 5 yuan to 65 yuan. Miscellaneous brands, with fewer floating accounts, saw the slightest decline, and the price difference narrowed.</p>
<p>Chinese shares were initially slightly sluggish, but banks and securities dealers continued to buy strongly. Large bondholders also came to buy old shares, and buying interest continued to spread, becoming weak but later firm. Yong Yarn rose to over 660 yuan, American Zhang to over 530 yuan, New Light rose to 43 yuan, Jingfu to 36 yuan, and Qinxing to 31 yuan. At midday, floating accounts closed, leading to a slight decline, but the underlying support remained firm. As a result, large shares closed higher by more than 30 yuan, and small shares closed higher by 3 yuan to 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign shares continued to advance, and investor sentiment remained good. Various parties held unlimited hopes for foreign shares, and holders were unwilling to easily sell. As a result, the demand for stocks dried up under the search of securities and money dealers. Under the various hopes of buyers, market prices soared. At midday, prices closed at a higher price again. As a result, prices rose by another 10% to 20%. British Chamber of Commerce Weaving and Dyeing Factory resumed operations today. In the future, foreign factories will inevitably resume work one after another, and the prospects for foreign shares are very bright.</p>
<p>Gold and Currency Calm</p>
<p>Spot gold was extremely stable yesterday. News from Chongqing was low. The opening was slightly sluggish, gradually narrowing to around 720,000 yuan. Later, as securities rose and investor sentiment improved, prices once recovered to 740,000 yuan. However, large accounts did not show enthusiasm, and market prices were difficult to sustain. Retail investors also sold gold for shares, with the supply of gold greater than shares. At midday, prices still hovered within 730,000 yuan. The afternoon remained calm, with current prices fluctuating slightly around 730,000 yuan. Transactions were few and far between. As a result, prices fell slightly by 4,000 yuan compared to before the close. With the end of the year approaching, large accounts did not want to be too active, and the overall trend may be a longer period of consolidation. Jewelry stores quoted gold ornaments at 79,000 yuan, refined silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars hovered around 450 yuan, with unofficial discounts mediocre, ranging from about 7% to 10%.</p>
<p>US currency continued to be calm, slightly rippling with the gold market. The overall trend always fluctuated within 1,210 yuan. The afternoon was the same. As a result, prices fell by 20 yuan compared to before the close. The trend was extremely sluggish, and transactions were not lively. Hong Kong currency was absorbed by Guangdong dealers at low prices, and shipping dealers also absorbed it, sweeping away the air of worry. New goods recovered by more than 10 yuan from around 45 yuan. Investors both within and outside the industry generally sought quick profits, so old goods were mediocre and unremarkable. As a result, old goods closed flat, while new goods recovered by 5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Fair-Price Oil Already on Sale</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice prices rose due to continued price increases in the interior. Both japonica and indica rice increased by 200 to 300 yuan. White Yuan Qingdao rice had a slightly better outlet, rising another 500 yuan. Flour was still exportable, but the local market remained sluggish. The oil market was tight in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Fair-price oil has already been distributed by the guild to various oil stores for retail sale at a price of 14,000 yuan, with the store also having a legitimate profit, totaling 8,000 dan. The first batch of 2,000 dan has been distributed, followed by further distribution. Soybeans were stable, and soybean cakes were being handled in Taiwan, making the market active and seeing a rise of 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Pricing of Textile Machines</h3>
<p>[Special Report] Foreign orders for ordinary textile machines have already been quoted in Chongqing. (A large American foreign firm) Each machine's iron material weighs 1,200 pounds, with a quoted price of US$741, equivalent to more than 900,000 legal currency, but freight, insurance, loading and unloading fees, etc., are not included. Major textile factories in this city have inquired by telegraph to the US and are planning a pre-order plan. (Wu)</p>
<h3>Asphalt Arrives Intermittently</h3>
<p>The asphalt price fell sharply and then rose slightly, a fleeting moment, and then became weak again. Although the production price is still firm, the arrival of goods in Shanghai is constant due to the opening of north and south roads. Yesterday, Jia and guests came to Shanghai to sell Kai He Ben oil for tens of items at 18,000 yuan, He Jiao, and North Road oil at 12,000 yuan. The quality of goods varied, nominally from Macheng but actually from mixed routes, even inferior to Lan oil. Therefore, merchants raised the price to 14,000 to 5,000 yuan, and He Ben oil was sold for 21,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>White Coal Rises and Then Returns to Level</h3>
<p>White coal screened blocks initially continued the previous trend and continued to rise sharply, once reaching the 300,000 yuan mark. Later, sellers frequently sold at high prices, causing the market to lack the strength to rise, so it returned to level. However, it was still higher than before. The trade in anthracite dross was sluggish, and the underlying support softened.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Can Pay Interest in this City, Customs Revenue Reaches 30 Million Yuan in the First Ten Days of the Month</h3>
<p>Starting today, interest on all types of unified bonds that have matured can be collected in Shanghai. The principal of the bonds that have been drawn will be paid after the customs revenue has accumulated. It is reported that as import and export trade in Shanghai is gradually booming, the revenue of the Jianghai Customs is also increasing accordingly. The total tax revenue from the 1st to the 10th of this month reached 302,400,895 yuan, including 257,501,578 yuan of import tax and 15,110,145 yuan of export tax. The tax revenue for the same period last month was only 17,158,513 yuan, including 15,003,586 yuan of import tax and no export tax.</p>
<h3>Longan Production Price Upside Down</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of Longan has increased, but sales have not been smooth. Therefore, the market continues to trend downwards. For example, mixed-route goods have fallen by another 10%, and even Xinghua Longan has continued to ease by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Longan meat has become weaker, with top-grade goods at 75,000 yuan and second-grade goods at 40,000 yuan. However, the production price has risen instead, forming an upside-down situation.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Stands Out</h3>
<p>Guest Dealers Compete to Search for Purchases</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market prospered, and investor sentiment was extremely outstanding. Guest dealers from all routes gathered, and the demand for spot goods increased greatly. The price of each brand rose by 30,000 to 40,000, with 20-count yarn being particularly profitable. Dealers from Sichuan and Hubei inquired about large factory goods first, and customers from Beijing and Hangzhou searched for small factory yarn later. The market price showed a straight upward trend.</p>
<h3>Bananas, Sugar Cane, and Everlasting Wheel Arrive in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Bananas, sugar cane, honey oranges, Xinhui oranges, and other fruits are all produced in South China, Guangdong, Shantou, and other places. Since the Japanese invasion of South China, the Shanghai-Guangdong shipping route has been interrupted. Except for a small number of sugar cane smuggled to Shanghai, other fruits have long disappeared. Most of the goods sold in the market are inferior goods from Korea and Taiwan. Yihua Company's Everlasting Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, carrying a large number of medicinal materials, etc. In addition, there were many fruits, all of which were bananas and sugar cane, with very few oranges. The ship is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong next Monday (24th) at noon. There are more than 11,000 bags of relief flour, which were shipped from the United States. The quantity is doubled compared to ordinary flour, with each bag weighing 100 pounds.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Invalid Import Tax Bills After June 1938</h3>
<p>Since taking over the Jianghai Customs, officials have stipulated that all tax receipts held for imported foreign goods that have been taxed in Shanghai after June 1938 are invalid. When transshipping to other ports, import tax must be paid (the tax rate is mostly 30% to 40% to 70% to 80%). This matter was published in the commercial news column of this newspaper on the 19th. At the same time, the author is a merchant from another port. Due to the restrictions of the aforementioned regulations of the Jianghai Customs, the dozens of goods purchased earlier, unless import tax is paid, (most of my purchases are industrial raw materials to promote production, and the import tax rate and surcharges need to be 39%) cannot be transported to other ports for sale. Because this measure of the Jianghai Customs directly stimulates commodity prices in other ports, and Shanghai loses a reasonable level, indirectly creating small-scale trafficking, causing congestion of cars and boats. Normal stores in other ports, such as complying with the regulations to pay huge amounts of import tax and legally transport goods, are difficult to compete with traffickers, resulting in the operation of normal stores that comply with the law being in an unfavorable state. Moreover, for eight years, stores in the occupied areas have paid taxes to the enemy and puppets. If this measure of the Customs is extended to other legitimate tax revenues of the country, such as income tax and business tax, all taxes that the government has not been able to collect in the past eight years will be collected from merchants one by one. If so, merchants in the occupied areas will have no way to survive. Furthermore, the administration of the Jianghai Customs after June 1938 was actually still under the jurisdiction of our government until the Pearl Harbor Incident on December 8, 1941, when the Jianghai Customs was completely controlled by the enemy and puppets. Now even the tax revenue during the period under the government's jurisdiction is not recognized. Judging from the circumstances, it does not seem to be fair. Although the Customs authorities also have a reason, it is that after June 1938, due to the unilateral agreement between Britain and Japan, the Customs revenue was deposited in the Zhengjin Bank from that period, and could not be transferred to the national treasury. However, this point should be blamed on the improper measures of the British government and the British tax commissioner. Now the government can negotiate with the United Kingdom to settle accounts with the enemy and recover the Customs duties deposited in the Zhengjin Bank after that period. It should not collect supplementary taxes from the people, especially not when transshipping to other ports, and collect supplementary taxes from merchants in other ports, making consumers outside Shanghai enjoy unequal treatment with consumers in Shanghai. I hope the authorities can reconsider. December 20</p>

<h3>Shanghai Educational Association's Charity Educational Loan Committee Declaration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Educational Loan Committee, organized by the Shanghai Educational Association, has launched a donation campaign among primary and secondary schools in the city. Tongyi Primary and Secondary School, Yakai Primary School, Minguo Primary and Secondary School, Chongshi Primary and Secondary School, and other schools have responded one after another and donated huge sums of money. Other schools are also in progress. Schools that are enthusiastic about the loan movement but have not yet started can contact the Association at 735 Zhongzheng Middle Road. The declaration of the Association is recorded below: No one can deny that education is always the most basic national defense work, whether in wartime or peacetime. Without good education, there is no need to talk about other national defense. The reason why some countries in the world are strong is entirely due to the development of education. However, let's take a look at our educational national defense?</p>
<p>Taking Shanghai, the heart of our country's culture, as an example, although no experts have done accurate statistics in this regard, everyone must know its fate due to what they have seen and heard.</p>
<p>Many school-age children are unable to attend school because they cannot afford it. Some work as beggars in the streets, or scavenge in the alleys. Many are driven to the market to be vendors, or to the factory to be workers. There are also many promising young people who are rejected outside the school gates due to the hardship of life. Some have to enter society, and some stand at the crossroads in despair because they cannot find a job.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the situation of those who are responsible for teaching and training these future masters. Almost all teachers and professors in Shanghai have been struggling on the edge of the famine line since the beginning of the War of Resistance. Many who can no longer endure the whipping of life have gradually jumped out of this poor educational circle and sought other ways out. As for those who have no way to go and have a special interest in education, although their income is even less than that of a rickshaw puller on the street, they are still gritting their teeth and struggling. However, it is very worrying to what extent and when they can struggle.</p>
<p>"Seeing these tragic situations, we cannot just think that this is a sign of the bankruptcy of education in Shanghai, this is a major crisis in society, nor can we think that this is only the result of the irresponsibility of our national or local government. We must know that since the victory of the War of Resistance, the national and local governments have had thousands of things to do and cannot concentrate all their efforts on this work. At the same time, we don't have to be disheartened. Since education in Shanghai has fallen into this predicament, and the citizens of Shanghai have faced this crisis, every citizen cannot stand idly by. We must take the responsibility of learning from and remedying the situation. We cannot completely push this responsibility onto the shoulders of the central and local governments. We should try our best to automatically rise up to plan rescue methods, so we organized the Shanghai Educational Loan Committee.</p>
<p>The history of Shanghai has told us this: Since the establishment of the Republic of China, all large-scale patriotic movements, cultural movements, and relief movements have been vigorously promoted by the citizens of the city, and Shanghai has been able to achieve the most superior and glorious success. Of course, our educational loan movement this time is no exception. We hope that people from all walks of life can understand and support it. The bright future of the country and society is entirely tied to the nationals of our next generation. We must irrigate and cultivate this tender bud in the wind and rain. We must contribute our efforts and money and enthusiastically support it so that it can grow strong and bloom with gorgeous flowers.</p>
<p>In short, we are all convinced that the people of Shanghai will not disappoint us in this profoundly meaningful loan movement!</p>

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Members Cooperate Sincerely - Municipal Advisory Council Established - Mayor Qian Hopes to Assist in Municipal Reform</h3>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Council held its inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the Municipal Government. Members present included Yan Huiqing, Guo Linshuang, Pan Xulun, Xi Yushu, Ge Jieshen, Liu Hongsheng, foreign members Douclai Stof (France), Liddell (England), Erlite (America), Marshall (England), Bowynden (America), and Hopkin (America). Deputy Mayor He Dequi, Secretary-General Shen Shihua, and Director of the Public Works Bureau Zhao Zengjue were also present. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Yan Huiqing, who discussed important municipal facilities in detail and made many suggestions. Foreign members Marshall, Hopkin, and Douclai Stof also spoke successively, expressing their willingness to cooperate.</p>
<p>Mayor Qian's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Qian said in his speech: The post-war reconstruction of this city is complex and cannot be undertaken by one person. It requires the efforts of everyone to succeed. As the Mayor of Shanghai, I sincerely hope that all members will cooperate with me and the Municipal Government to provide valuable insights at any time. Shanghai has many problems to solve. We have encountered all kinds of problems that large cities and commercial ports have. I was ordered to be the Mayor of this city and feel a heavy responsibility. However, since I took office, I have been trying to alleviate the suffering of the citizens and promote the revitalization of this city, and plan for the future development of this city, so that all residents of the city, regardless of race, religion, or nationality, can live and work in peace. In order to gather opinions and benefit from each other, the Municipal Government has established the Municipal Advisory Council. I am convinced that from now on, we will be able to obtain insightful guidance from Chinese and foreign leaders on all issues related to the city's municipal administration.</p>
<p>Three Tasks</p>
<p>As you all know, the functions of the Advisory Council are threefold. First, it is to review the municipal events submitted by me for deliberation. Second, it is to make suggestions on municipal issues. Third, it is to provide opinions to the Provisional Municipal Council. We hope that the hopes and opinions of Chinese and foreign residents of this city can be conveyed to the municipal authorities through the advisory committee, so that the policies of the municipal government can meet the needs of the citizens. Everyone, the task of the Advisory Council is not passive. The members are not limited to reviewing the events submitted by me for deliberation. You are all welcome to raise opinions and suggestions on your own initiative. The suggestions provided by the Advisory Council can be submitted to the Provisional Municipal Council, which will be established soon, for discussion when necessary. If it is passed in the Municipal Council, then this proposal will have full legal force and will be even more important. There are many foreigners in this city. This Advisory Council, which is jointly composed of Chinese and foreign residents' leaders, naturally occupies a very important position in the city's civic groups. Although the proportion of foreigners is not large compared with our Chinese residents, we still feel that it is necessary to invite foreign leaders to participate in this Advisory Council. Therefore, I am convinced that the establishment of the Advisory Council can promote Chinese and foreign understanding and cooperation.</p>
<p>Accept Proposals</p>
<p>You have all served this city for many years, are enthusiastic about public welfare, and have rich experience. You are leaders who are unanimously respected by the residents. I place complete trust and unwavering faith in you and hope that you can assist me in promoting municipal reform. What you see and hear is what I see and hear. In many ways, I will rely on you to obtain correct knowledge and appropriate proposals so that Shanghai can not only become the main city in the Far East, but also continue to stand in the ranks of the world's major cities. I hope that you can provide opinions on municipal administration from time to time. As for myself, I will cooperate with you sincerely and accept your opinions and proposals to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>Brief commentary</p>
<h3>New Initiatives in Shanghai Municipal Administration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has established the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, inviting leading figures from China, Britain, the United States, and France as members, with Mr. Yan Huiqing serving as the chairman, which was announced a few days ago. Mayor Qian Dajun said at the establishment of the committee: "The post-war reconstruction of the city is complex and cannot be undertaken by one person. It requires the collective efforts of everyone to succeed." This is enough to show the mayor's humility, and also illustrates the government's eagerness to see success. Under the unequal treaties, Shanghai originally had separate administrations in the concessions. Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished, the concession administrations have also disappeared. However, Shanghai is China's premier commercial port, and the percentage of foreigners residing there in the city's population is not large, but the number is not small. Some have extensive experience in municipal facilities, and others have specialized knowledge, all of which can assist the municipal authorities. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Standing Bureau invites them to be members and organizes the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee. It is believed that they will contribute greatly to municipal administration.</p>
<p>Shanghai is an international city, and post-war reconstruction is indeed complex, as Mayor Qian said. This requires the sincere cooperation of Chinese and foreign citizens. The establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee shows how willing the municipal authorities are to humbly accept the support of foreign residents and leaders from all walks of life in our country, and how dedicated they are to promoting understanding and cooperation between China and foreign countries. We hope that this new municipal organization can fulfill its mission and set an example for Sino-foreign cooperation!</p>

<h3>American Night Fighter "Black Widow"</h3>
<p>— S Ming</p>
<p>Since the US Air Force established a Flying Fortress base in Chengdu last year, it has dealt a major fatal blow to the Japanese army in the East Asian theater. The B29 type has since frequently gone to Japan to bomb, causing the enemy to panic. They desperately tried to find out the US Air Force base, and finally determined that it was Chengdu Airport. So they risked bombing it, but the defense there was tight. After the daylight air raids by the Japanese failed, they implemented night bombing. At that time, the US Air Force supplied Europe and sent four night fighters named "Black Widow" to Chengdu. The manufacturing was very clever and mysterious, specially suitable for night fighting. The aircraft is a single-engine twin-boom type, and there is only one aviator, who is both the pilot and the small cannon gunner. The aircraft is painted with stealth paint, which absorbs light instead of reflecting it, so it is not easy to see it at night, which is one of its features.</p>
<p>As for the inside of the fuselage, all the organs are indicated by ultraviolet rays that cannot be seen with the naked eye. The pilot is equipped with special instruments and can still see everything, so it is not easy for the enemy to find her location, which is her second feature.</p>
<p>The third feature is that the aircraft is equipped with a secret instrument like a compass, using wireless waves to control a fairly large space. If an enemy aircraft flies into this wave range, the compass needle will rotate by itself, indicating the direction of the enemy aircraft. The pilot can clearly see the direction and attack the target. According to the US Air Force, this mysterious compass was invented based on the method of catching insects by a black spider in Africa. Because when a spider catches insects, it often sits alone in the center of the web, waiting for food. Once an insect hits the web, spider silk will pull the spider, and the spider will immediately follow the direction and catch the insect. This clever method aroused the interest of scientists, who imitated it and invented the compass, which is used in night fighters. That kind of spider is called "Black Widow", so this night fighter is also called "Black Widow".</p>
<p>When there is an air raid alarm at night, all the other fighters on the ground hide to avoid misunderstandings. The "Black Widow" immediately takes off to fight. It flies very high, patrolling everywhere, waiting for the enemy aircraft. When its compass finds a target, it quickly flies in the direction to attack. The enemy aircraft has not yet discovered it, and it has already flown over the enemy aircraft. Suddenly, two strong searchlights are turned on in its abdomen, directly forcing the target, making the enemy aircraft pilot dizzy and helpless. At this critical moment, the "Black Widow" fired a small steel cannon from its abdomen, and with a bang, immediately sent the enemy aircraft to its death! Once the mission is completed, she will rise to the sky again to search for enemy aircraft. This terrible raid simply made the enemy unable to cope.</p>
<p>One night in March this year, more than a dozen Japanese aircraft attacked the Chengdu base. Our side dispatched four "Black Widows" and shot down all the Japanese aircraft, without any survivors, establishing a great achievement, making the Japanese army confused and greatly shocked. Since then, they have never dared to bomb again. Since the amazing news of that secret aircraft came out, the people in the rear have praised the "Black Widow" in unison, but many people still do not know the details, and mistakenly believe that the "Black Widow" that shot down more than a dozen enemy aircraft that time was a famous female air force pilot in the United States!</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Keeping to the Right</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Starting from New Year's Day next year, people in Shanghai will walk on the right instead of the left, keeping up with the world trend and improving.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if this movement is to be implemented, it must be universal. Not only must large cities do so, but also remote rural areas should implement it, so that the whole country is consistent and facilitates traffic. Otherwise, if the systems in various places are different, one with left-hand traffic and one with right-hand traffic, people will find it difficult to avoid accidents when traveling?</p>
<p>I think that before implementation, various places should conduct popular training in advance so that every person can have this common sense of right-hand traffic. The methods can be divided into three points:</p>
<p>(1) Schools — Schools are institutions for knowledge transmission. The principals and standing bureaus of each school can be designated to teach students the implementation methods so that ordinary families can understand.</p>
<p>(2) Baojia — Baojia is an administrative management organization. Once an order is issued, everyone will abide by it. The Baojia chiefs can be ordered to give more advice to the people in their jurisdiction to make it easier to universalize.</p>
<p>(3) Broadcasting — If the aforementioned two methods cannot make all the people understand, the time can be set to broadcast lectures so that people of all classes can deeply understand this policy and implement it fully.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Sexual Issues</h3>
<p>— Cui Jingtai</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I went to a bookstore to browse newspapers and books. The store had several newly published books, about ten copies of each displayed on the counter for people to pick up and read. There were many people looking at books. In that row of new books, there was a gap. I saw that only one book remained in the gap. It was the Chinese translation of Ellis's *Psychology of Sex*. Several young men were holding it and reading it with great interest. I picked up the last copy of *Psychology of Sex*. Just looking at the price, it was quite expensive, costing more than 100,000 in counterfeit currency! I had to choose what I wanted to know and read that first. After reading for a while, I noticed someone behind me was looking at what I was reading. I felt a little embarrassed. My mind wandered, and I couldn't concentrate on the content of the book anymore. I flipped through it randomly and put it back. Someone immediately took it. I happened to see a line of small characters on the cover of the book on that person's back: "Researching the most serious problem in life."</p>
<p>The day before, Mr. Zhang Yaoxiang, who teaches social psychology, was talking about several innate human impulses. He said, "The greatest impulses in human life are, first, hunger, and second, sexual desire. The most interesting thing about this World War is probably Hitler marrying his lover in the bomb-shattered Berlin camp. This terrifying and hateful demon king, on the day before he saw his demise and had to commit suicide, actually completed the most unfathomable event of his life amidst such inexplicable turmoil; the Duke of Windsor giving up the throne for Mrs. Simpson has also become a very humane anecdote. The noble and virtuous Su Wu, living among the Xiongnu, swallowing felt and drinking snow, married and had children with a Xiongnu princess during nineteen years of hardship. Edgar Snow, the author of *Red Star Over China*, wrote in the book that when he interviewed Mr. Mao Zedong, he asked Mr. Mao what he thought of women. Mr. Mao replied that he was not interested. However, not long after, Mr. Mao married Ms. Lan Ping, a film star from Shanghai. On his deathbed, Napoleon of France frequently called out the name of his wife, as if he had forgotten everything worldly. Without the love affairs of the protagonists, how could those great historical films like *Cleopatra* succeed as touching films?"</p>
<p>Professor Yu Rixuan once spoke to a group of young people about self-cultivation, also mentioning that when he was studying in middle school, he heard many classmates liked to talk about sex. He found it disgusting and told his teacher. The teacher said to him, "Very good that you don't like to talk about sex, but do you think about it in your heart?" He blushed at the teacher's question, lowered his head, and admitted: "I do."</p>
<p>Who doesn't think about sex? The problem lies in this "thinking"!</p>
<p>Sex is like a raging fire in human life. It can nourish people, but it can also easily destroy them.</p>
<p>Humanity has made many contributions in natural science and society, but we are still very ignorant about ourselves. When will our generation have enlightened and correct views on sexuality?</p>

<h3>The Annoying Fog of Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Mei Youyun</p>
<p>The long-awaited clear sky finally arrived. The winter sun comforted the mountain city, and the cold wind and rain disappeared. People's moods warmed up again. However, that annoying fog still surrounds Chongqing, obstructing people's vision!</p>
<p>Personnel returning to the capital are leaving one after another. Some have serious problems with blankets after arriving in Nanjing because their families cannot leave. Some, because they are old and weak, fear they will die on the plane, and are writing their wills first. Compatriots in the recovered areas! Not all "Chongqing people" are so hateful. After these people returning to the capital arrive in Nanjing, they will bring the spirit of "poorly working" and "hard working" that Chongqing people have maintained for eight years.</p>
<p>Special Envoy Marshall has taken off with an important mission to China. We welcome this friendly guest.</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference has been delayed for so long because of waiting for the Yan'an representatives. Now the thirty-odd Yan'an representatives have arrived. Many people are placing their sincere hope for peace on the Political Consultative Conference. These thirty-odd Yan'an representatives are busy with "visits" and "exchanges of views". Will they be able to dispel this annoying fog of sorrow?</p>

<h3>The Difficulty of Seal Carving</h3>
<p>— Wen Quan</p>
<p>Is it easier to carve "white seals" or "red seals"? Every person who wants to learn seal carving often asks people this question. Someone with seal carving experience will definitely tell him to start learning from "white seals" first, and then learn "red seals." Indeed, for beginners, carving "white seals" is easier to learn than "red seals."</p>
<p>Or you may think otherwise, because after you learn "red seals" in the second step and become quite skilled, when you go back to carve "white seals," you will feel that "white seals" are difficult to carve, and it seems that "red seals" are easier. If you go through another period of time, and then you carve "red seals" again, then you will similarly feel that "red seals" are more difficult to carve than "white seals." Thus, in this way, one difficulty and one ease, one ease and one difficulty, repeatedly switch.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not a question of whether it is difficult or easy to carve "white seals" and "red seals." The actual issue lies in your relationship between familiarity and unfamiliarity with carving "white seals" and "red seals." After carving "red seals" for a while, because of familiarity, you feel it is easy, while "white seals," because of a period of unfamiliarity, then feel difficult. Similarly, after carving "white seals" for a while, and then carving "red seals," you will also have a feeling of difficulty and ease.</p>
<p>Seal carving is like this, and so is learning and doing things!</p>
<p>Writing</p>
<h3>The Issue of Horizontal Writing of Chinese Characters</h3>
<p>— Wang Shuliang</p>
<p>I remember that someone abroad once asked: "When you Chinese write horizontally, is it from left to right or from right to left?" For ambiguous Chinese people, it was really impossible to answer. Now, I'm afraid some people will still ask the same question! The Municipal Education Bureau issued a special circular on November 24 to all primary and secondary schools and social education institutions, stipulating that "when Chinese is written horizontally, whether on charts, plaques, road signs, and all other documents, advertisements, etc., it should be from right to left."</p>
<p>In fact, writing Chinese characters from right to left horizontally is our country's traditional habit, but later a part of the text was changed to horizontal from left to right. It also has its unavoidable difficulties. The first is many articles mixed with Arabic numerals, such as those discussing arithmetic, accounting, etc. The second is scientific and engineering articles, which often mix formulas and numbers, and also add academic names in Roman letters. And in the present era of increasingly close world cultural exchanges, many articles also need to add the original names in Roman letters and attach Western texts. In addition, there are Chinese lyrics in musical staves. … When writing these horizontally, if you change to right to left, it will be inconvenient or even impossible!</p>
<p>Especially when writing with a pen, because ordinary people write with their right hand, horizontally from left to right; if from top to bottom, it can be written very well, and each character can be compared neatly with the many characters that have already been written; finally, write to the lower right of the paper, and the right hand returns to its original position near the body, which is also very natural. But, if you write horizontally from right to left? Then it is not easy to write well. Because when you write with your right hand, you will cover up all the characters already written on the right. On the one hand, it is impossible to compare neatly, and on the other hand, it is easy to smudge the newly written words. Why is there no problem when writing Chinese vertically from right to left? This is because when writing from top to bottom, each character can be compared neatly with the characters above, and when changing to write a new line, you only need to align the position of the first character, and the following characters can be connected and written.</p>
<p>The direction of horizontal writing is closely related to the direction of bookbinding. A book, assuming it is bound on the right side, and the horizontal writing is from left to right, looks unpleasant. The opposite is also true. And now, the books, newspapers, and documents in our country seem to have the following trends: (1) Books bound on the right side, horizontal writing from right to left; books bound on the left side, horizontal writing from left to right. (2) In vertical text from right to left, horizontal text can be mixed in or beside it, and horizontal text from right to left. (If the characters are arranged horizontally and turned into a vertical direction, then from left to right). (3) Plaques and signs, with the traditional habit not easy to break, are still mostly from right to left. But lengthy horizontal texts from right to left are no longer commonly seen.</p>
<p>In short, when writing Chinese horizontally, it is sometimes inconvenient or impossible to write from right to left. But almost no horizontal writing from right to left cannot be changed to from left to right. And horizontal writing from left to right conforms to internationalization and has unignorable advantages for promoting science and engineering. The current director and deputy director of the Municipal Education Bureau are both veterans of engineering education, and they should have the same feeling about this. So, please withdraw the order!</p>
<p>Rare News</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Cocktail</h3>
<p>— Mu Ye</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers often publish news of "cocktail parties" being held. I heard that it costs about one million in legal currency to host one, which shows a glimpse of its luxury.</p>
<p>Cocktail is a literal translation of the word "Cocktail." It tastes sweet and sour and has a fragrant aroma, because it is made by mixing whiskey, brandy, and other liquors with sugar, spices, and bitters (vinegar). This famous wine is mostly produced in the United States and began to become popular about a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>It is said that the person who invented this precious drink was a Mexican nobleman. This nobleman had a beautiful daughter named Xochitt. One day, he brewed this wine and ordered his daughter to present it to the king in person. Unexpectedly, as soon as the king saw her, he fell in love and drank the wine in one gulp, and then used her fragrant name to name the wine. Later, Xochitt was transformed into Cocktail, which is the current cocktail.</p>

<h3>Quickly Issue Rewards for Secretly Reported Enemy Property - Reader Requests Reply</h3>
<p>A letter from Mr. Tang Shengming, a reader of this newspaper, states: I previously secretly reported a piece of enemy property to the Third Front Army Headquarters, which has been sealed up by the headquarters. I have inquired several times about when the reward will be issued, but there has been no definite answer. When the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau was established, it was announced that all cases of enemy and puppet property would be handled by the processing bureau. I have submitted inquiries several times, but have not received any instructions. From the sealing up to now, it has been two and a half months. In terms of time, it cannot be considered short. The processing bureau and the headquarters handle many cases, but the enemy property I reported was sealed up two months ago, and I have recently heard that the valuation has been completed, and the reward should be issued first. Now, it is delayed, which really makes me not know why. If there are any difficulties in it, I am willing to comply. I now request the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau and the Third Front Army Headquarters to quickly issue the reward to maintain the credibility of the government. I earnestly request the editor to revise this letter and publish it in your newspaper. I am extremely grateful. (Note) The person who secretly reported has fulfilled his responsibility of secretly reporting, and the authorities should contact him, and inform the date of reward, so as to put his heart at ease. It is inappropriate to ignore him.</p>

<h3>Winter Relief Urgently Needed</h3>
<p>These few days of this year, the weather has suddenly turned cold, and the north wind is whistling. The general poor compatriots and unemployed workers are feeling a serious threat. Because of the high prices of goods, they "have no clothes" and "have no rice," and are suffering greatly. As for the "Winter Relief Movement" initiated by the authorities and enthusiastic people, the intention is good, and the methods should strive for practical benefits. I think that the number of poor compatriots who need winter relief this year is more than in previous years (because clothing is very expensive). I hope that the authorities and people from all walks of life will quickly promote a large-scale and widespread winter relief movement, so that the compatriots in distress can get through this difficult winter, and the country and society will benefit from it. Also, winter relief has a major relationship to social security. Please everyone urgently handle winter relief! (Should)</p>
<p>Tuberculosis Prevention Lecture</p>
<h3>Theory of No Worry for Lung Disease (5)</h3>
<p>(9) To Eliminate Infection, Isolation and Recuperation Are Necessary</p>
<p>All general open pulmonary tuberculosis patients, that is, those whose sputum contains tuberculosis bacteria, are the source of spreading pulmonary tuberculosis seeds, and can be called dangerous elements in society. The transmission routes are either due to the patient's spitting anywhere, and drying up, spreading with the air, or because of eating at the same table, and the utensils are not distinguished, and are transmitted by saliva from the sick person. The spread of lung disease, this is the biggest factor, and the harm to social health is no greater than this. Therefore, in order to eliminate infection, the examination of the patient's sputum is very important. If the examination result shows that tuberculosis bacteria are already present in the sputum, they should be immediately hospitalized for treatment and completely isolated from the outside world. This measure is not only of great concern to social health, but also provides the individual patient with suitable conditions for recuperation due to hospitalization, such as sufficient air and sunlight, appropriate nutrition, and absolute quiet, so as to improve their own resistance and embark on the path of early recovery to health.</p>
<p>(10) Eradicate Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Revive the Nation. Pulmonary tuberculosis must be treated for a long period of time. The loss of time and economy suffered by patients is far greater than that of general diseases, and it also hinders production and has a major impact. In our country, public health and tuberculosis prevention facilities have not been popularized, and the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis is alarming. Poor countries and poor people, this is especially true! It is a major obstacle to the revival of the nation. Therefore, eradicating pulmonary tuberculosis is not only an urgent task to improve people's health, but also an important requirement for improving life. However, in order to achieve results, the public must generally recognize the importance of early diagnosis, and then popularize X-ray examination work, so as to produce the following effects: (A) Enable early detection of lung disease, without losing the opportunity for early radical treatment. (B) Due to early radical treatment, early recovery to health, saving both time and economy. (C) Due to early recovery to health, early recovery of production capacity, individuals, families, and society will benefit. (D) Because one person's early cure prevents multiple people from being infected, countless losses to society are avoided invisibly. The various effects arising from the above-mentioned early diagnosis are already considerable from the individual's point of view. When calculating millions of people together, the losses reduced and the increase in productivity are countless, which is an important factor in stabilizing society and increasing national strength. It is deeply hoped that social elites will vigorously promote early diagnosis, so as to jointly eradicate this pulmonary tuberculosis that endangers the nation's health, achieve practical results, and lay a solid foundation for the revival of the nation.
