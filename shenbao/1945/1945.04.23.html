<p>東京二十二日中央社電　敵美為補救冲繩周邊航空兵力缺乏，特全力注於增强冲繩本島北中兩飛機塲之陸上機，强化慶良間列島，津堅島，神山，水名島，伊江島等本島周邊諸島之施設，冲繩本島敵艦艇以艦砲射擊，依然執抝蠢動中。敵軍十九日以來，轉變全面攻勢，繼續强製，以列島綫為目標，敵艦載續消滅中。二十一日夜，於本島東南方捕捉敵有力機動部隊，並予猛攻，二十，二十一兩日晝間，續攻本島之北，中兩飛機塲，粉碎敵之企圖，日軍如斯猛攻，使敵第一綫將士喪胆失魂，更覺恐怖。據十二日曼羅鮑羅恩之廣播云，日軍之捨命特別攻擊，使美兵，澳洲兵全變為神經衰弱症，率直承認日軍之猛攻，美國海軍航空部長拉摩塞亦稱，美海軍被日特攻隊幾重包圍，非費慘酷重大犧牲，不能突出重圍云云，對日軍特攻隊不勝恐懼，發出悲鳴。美國當局更將日軍特攻隊之存在及其猛烈損害隱蔽，然時至今日，再不能加以隱蔽，瀝瀝而承認一事，殊堪注目，據華盛頓AP電，對冲繩作戰美軍截至目前之死傷者，內中海軍將兵之死傷，駕陸軍以上，初次報告，由日軍特攻隊之猛擊，而予敵艦船極大損害，如斯日軍攻隊之猛擊，予敵之損害飛躍增大，更使敵桑胆失魂。</p>

<h3 id="c9">粉碎敵方謀略宣傳 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>目前太平洋戰局的焦點，在於冲繩島爭奪之役，默察敵方最近戰略企圖，敵美最高統帥部方面，最大目標企圖在四月二十五日以前，不僅攻陷柏林，解決歐洲戰爭，而且妄圖攻奪冲繩，試向九州登陸，以同時脅服日本，因為只有這兩方面的野心滿足了，美國才能在舊金山會議中，執協約國之牛耳，而為戰後世界組織的盟主。至於其他反軸心國家，則企圖在四月二十五日前攻陷柏林，然後在舊金山會議中討論東亞戰局的戰略重心，應付日本。依照目前的趨勢，敵美不得不退讓一步而放棄東西戰綫同時解決的妄想，追從後一種企圖。但是為了表示具有在東亞戰勝的實力起見，於舊金山會議前或會議中，在東亞取得若干進展，俾於今後的國際地位，不致為蘇聯所壓制。當然，盟邦日本在今日決不容許敵美這種野心獲逞。所以，以冲繩之戰為中心的戰役，已在如火如荼的進行，為全世界所注目。</p>
<p>敵美自三月十七日開始由硫黃島向琉球羣島侵犯，演成冲繩之役，自舟在此戰役中，集登陸用舟艇以舛，戰鬥艦艇亦達三百餘艘之多。他們的戰略，一方面以空軍對日本九州等地大舉轟炸，牽制日本本土空軍不能向前增援，一面對台灣及我國沿海不斷空襲，以阻止及破壞日本與大陸和南洋的交通運輸連絡，然後以其海軍主力向冲繩島推進。敵美對日本本土的緒戰，就這樣展開了。他們的野心，當然不僅在於冲繩一島或若干島嶼的占領，並企圖誘使日本全部海軍出動，予以主力打擊。</p>
<p>可是，敵方速戰速決的妄想，已在日本陸海空軍，尤其是特攻隊的反擊下，給予粉碎，戰爭迄今已一月有餘，不但敵人企圖的實現，極不可能，相反的，敵軍有六個師團被困島上，不可能利用以向九州或另處挑起戰役。迨至本月十八日，敵美對冲繩展開總攻擊，作為羅斯福逝世後舊金山會議前替美國爭面子的掙扎，並且含有更大徼倖冒險的成份，觀乎對日本本土空襲規模之擴大，及要求英國協同作戰一點，可以充分證實其野心。</p>
<p>反軸心方面宣傳已久的舊金山會議，日內即將舉行，敵方的全部謀略，岡窮匕見，已不在遠。今日敵方謀略宣傳的中心，不外第一，歐洲戰爭結束以後，將調用歐洲兵力至亞洲作戰；第二，舊金山會議後，蘇聯對東亞戰爭的態度將改變；第三，在整個國際新局面展開之時，即反軸心聯合應付日本之日。但是，我們觀察目前現實情勢，敵方的企圖，畢竟是謀略的宣傳而已，不會發生決定性的作用。同時，我們惟有團結東亞十億人民的總力，粉碎敵人的謀略宣傳。</p>
<h3 id="c10">東亞各地周間戰况 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　大東亞周間戰况如下：</p>
<p>冲繩方面　冲繩本島陸上戰鬥情况，依然熾烈，在過去十三天內，敵軍不能前進一步，呈膠着狀態，敵軍為打開此局面，企圖奪取北中兩飛機塲及慶良間列島之飛機塲，以謀向冲繩本島北部進犯。同時，在神山島·津堅島以及衛星羣島之伊江登陸，並於十六日在水納島登陸，對南部日軍主要陣地採取包圍形勢。又敵軍為掩護接濟登陸軍，不斷從艦上發砲轟擊，十七日前後有五百數十架，十八日約三百數十架，十九日約六百五十架敵艦戰機來襲列島各基地。十七日以後，B24·P40型陸上機參加攻擊冲繩及附近島嶼日軍基地，由此可見敵軍已開始使用該方面陸上基地。又南部日軍陣地上空，時有敵機二三十架協助陸上作戰，日神風特攻隊等航空部隊，冒惡劣氣候，日夜出擊，猛力攻擊敵機動部隊及本島四周艦船並陸上部隊，擊沉擊毀敵艦船已達四百艘以上，敵軍猶整頓殘部，死守登陸軍及接濟綫。十五·十六兩日，有艦上機約百架來襲南九州，其規模甚小，可以窺見敵機動部隊所受日軍打擊甚大，敵為補充機動部隊，從馬里亞納調B29機至九州方面，更從硫黃島調出P51型機，專事戰略轟炸，今日琉球羣島雙方空軍勢力仍不相上下，戰局歸趨，將受航空消砂之支配。</p>
<p>馬里亞納　馬里亞納方面B29型，P51型等敵機，週三起移用於九州方面，協助直接作戰，以補充航空勢力之缺陷，尤有P51型之來襲，可證明敵軍硫黃島整備已漸告完成。此種小型機不能作大規模破壞，但今後或將擾亂日本後方，妨碍生產。又敵方向來使用於歐洲方面之B17，B24，P38等中小型飛機，今亦擬調用於東亞方面，聞敵方已停止制製造B29，B32大型機，着手發行此類中小型機</p>
<p>菲島方面　菲島內海敵艦船動向逐漸活動，中旬以後，在棉蘭着島之達里薩夫，有小部敵軍登陸。又該島西岸科泰勃德方面，敵出動戰艦及巡洋艦，發砲射擊後，派有力部隊登陸，目下正展開激戰中。呂宋方面，各地日軍士氣旺盛，使敵大量流血，現尚在激戰者，為碧瑤西方地區山岳地帶，在巴依湖四周亦有激戰。</p>
<p>西南太平洋　敵機來襲已見稀少，婆羅洲東岸峇厘巴板，塔拉干方面，仍有少數敵機來襲。</p>
<p>緬甸方面　北緬日軍部隊，在凱馬來山附近整頓陣容，與南下之敵軍發生接觸。又中部緬甸方面，十七日敵軍出動戰車百輛，進犯梅克迭拉迤南約八十公里之休埃堯附近，梅克迭拉西方約六十公里之克柯曼頓敵軍，亦於該日發動攻勢，日軍部隊正與之交綏中。</p>
<p>印度洋方面　印度洋方面，十四日英機動部隊來襲蘇門答臘西方尼耶斯島，與日軍守備隊交戰，此次敵軍來犯力量極低弱。</p>
<h3 id="c11">美國的苦悶　（三） <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 松平忠久</p>
<p>特魯曼在暫時間大槪沒有什麼變化，但經過相當時候，各方面的難事會接連而來，這是不難想像的。</p>
<h3 id="c12">外交軍事困難重重 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>第一大槪是外交。過去美國對外政策，由大總統獨斷獨行，把斯蒂工留斯驅使得好像個外交秘書；但特魯曼未曾見過外交塲面，他以前與邱吉爾史太林見面時也是語無倫次，儘說些不着邊際的話，恐怕華盛頓的各國大使也不會對他表示尊敬，因此美國外交今後唯有趨於沒落，而上院外交委員會的權力將反見加强，大總統在外交上地位必一落千丈，美國的國家成嚴必墮落無疑。</p>
<p>其次是他不能統馭陸海軍，將使政府與軍部間發生不能統一的現象。美國大總統是陸海軍最高司令官，史丁生·福萊斯德·金格·艾森霍華·尼米資·麥克沃塞等將領無不受其指揮。羅斯福在第一次大戰時已任海軍次長，其能力與政治上的閱歷，足使此等陸海軍將領甘願供其驅使，然則特魯曼呢？在第一次大戰發生時，　才做了陸軍大尉，咨格極淺，當然不為將領們所尊敬，特魯曼徒有總統虛名，地位比他們高，因這一點，軍部和政府間不能調整，且陸軍和海軍間恐亦將失其協調。</p>
<h3 id="c13">國會方面最難對付 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>再關於美國國內統一，我也替他們躭着憂。華萊士·摩根韜·易克斯等精幹閣僚，無論自黨的經歷或其能力言，都為特魯輕望塵莫及的，尤其華萊士早先已　經做過副大總統，他是否願意聲聲應諾，屈就在特魯曼之下呢？據外電傳稱，閣僚中已有多人決心要辭職，從我看來這是必然的。因為無論你要怎樣為國家出力，但誰願受密蘇里鄉人的指使呢，所以預料內部必將發生裂痕。在這里觀察，特魯曼感到最難對付的恐是國會了，上面已經說過，國會可以牽制大總統權限。如果是位有能力的總統，國會尚能容納大總統的獨裁權，惟對於這樣庸庸碌碌的總統，當然不能賦予如此强力獨裁權，即使特魯曼要想公布什麼戰時法律，使得作戰進行比較順利，但是國會因其能力不充分，將不賦予此種權力，又對於大總統所施行的各項重要政策，國會亦將隨時加以拒絕不通過，但我想特魯曼為了息事寗人，免得和國會發生磨擦，恐將極端尊重國會意見，採取柔的寡斷的態度，使戰時美國政治色彩逐漸褪色。</p>
<h3 id="c14">特魯曼勢將失敗 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>外國通信　電報，曾經下這樣的批評說：特魯曼最後所遭遇的難關，乃是確保國民生活與補充軍需二事的難以調節，蓋美國人民生活已苦不堪言，為着勞動力不足，惡性通貨膨脹日趨嚴重，運輸力缺乏，生活必需品激滅等種種原因，人民生活威脅重重，雖然他們增加了一點了陣亡將士遺族的津貼全額，但社會上不安情形已到無可諱飾的地步，政府方面為緩和此種情形起見，願望歐洲戰爭早日結束，並向人民保證增加民需物資，決定戰事結束之後，把陸軍方面軍需工業的三分之一，轉變為民需工業，然能否實現還是大問題，據西綫反軸心軍司令艾森霍華營告本國政府稱，對德作戰已漸化成游擊戰，所以作戰前途不許我們樂觀，肅清此種游擊戰，尚需相當長時期，在此期內，決不能减少兵力，故美國陸海軍仍希望繼續供給武器，子彈，船舶及飛機等，政府聲明軍需工廠恢復為民需工廠，究屬難事，在羅斯福時代也為此問題幾經波折，並且戰時生產局長納爾遜亦因此事不能解決而提出辭職，今日的特魯曼，你有頂不住應付嗎？（完）</p>

<p>— 人平</p>
<h3 id="c29">多如雨後春笋 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>南京市的金融業，說也奇怪，在　經濟極度困疲的近幾年中，新銀行錢荘反紛紛開設起來。銀行錢荘，按理應該負有扶植工商業，調劑社會經濟的使命，但是近年以來，像雨後春筍一般的成立起來的南京銀錢兩業，究竟對上項的使命有無貢獻，實在使人不無懷疑。</p>
<p>京市銀行銀號錢荘的集中地，是中華路建康路朱雀路的三角地帶，三步一行四步一荘的觸人眼目，常常會　見錢荘改爲銀行，而　全　起了簇新的高樓。</p>
<p>照目前統計，除了國家銀行一所外，現有銀行的數字，計有五十六家，銀號錢荘多達一百十七家。同時現在還有不斷的預備開設中；雖然財政當局早已限制了頒發執照，事實上總是道高一尺，魔高一丈。如果觀察這些小銀行小錢荘的內容和營業，大都清淡可憐，所謂黃金時代，早成過去了。</p>
<h3 id="c30">實行强化金融 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>銀錢兩業的直接管理機關，是中　檢查金融事務處京分處，曾在去年十一月奉令强化金融業，頒布了「强化金融機關業務綱要」，實行整飭一般不健全的金融機構，並且限各行荘於三個月內實行增費或全併，每一銀行最低資本額由六百萬元增至一千萬元，實繳數是五百萬元。錢荘最低資本額由四百萬元增至六百萬元，實繳數也是一半。目前銀行中資本額最高的是華興商業銀行，實繳資本額達五千萬元；而最低的資本額實繳數不足規定三百萬元的卻還有幾家存在。</p>
<p>强化工作在本年二月二十二日開始，對放款加以限制，凡是個人堂記放款不得超過二十萬元，公司商號工廠的放款，不得超過二百萬元，如在二百萬以上的，就須申請核准後，方可放出。另一方面重視填報各種表報·凡放款·存款各類·或者是日報，或者是月報，多達二十餘種。</p>
<p>至於存款凖備金，還是按照過去辦法，規定活期百分之十，定期百分之五，繳存在中　銀行。根據了每日各行荘存款總數繳納，作爲存戶的唯一保障。</p>
<h3 id="c31">各成立凖備庫 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>銀錢業自身的集體組織，各有同業公會，負責銀行同業分會的是葛亮　召集錢業同業公會的是湯紹衡。</p>
<p>最近銀錢兩業，爲了發展金融，調劑同業貸放，又分別組成了一個銀行業聯合凖備庫和錢業聯合凖備庫。銀行業聯合凖備庫參加的單位有五十一家，每單位繳納凖備金二十五萬元，並向中儲銀行貸借二千萬元。銀錢兩業同時在中儲行內組有票據交換所，每日下午各同業派員作同業的票據交換工作，或者銀行業和錢業的票據相互交換工作。</p>
<h3 id="c32">限制商店押款 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>還有商品的押款，對銀錢業也是一椿重大的事，京市府當局，爲謀物價管理收得實效起見，曾公布「貨物押款辦法」，分令市商會和各同業公會，對各商店向銀行錢荘的貨品押款，限制不得超過担保品的十分之七，但是准許先行承押後次日開列店號抵押品種類數量現值押款金額呈報市府審核，如果不報私做押款，或者超過規定數額，一經查覺，就要嚴罰。</p>
<p>照目前京市金融業數量言，已超出了實際的需要量，粗製嚂造的實在太多，尤其許多脆弱性的小行荘，所有滙兌，存款，拆放，抵押等正當營業，可說爲數無幾，大都作爲恍子，幕後兼營一些國積投　等等非法營業，藉以維持開支而已。至於對一般農工業的投資，都感力所未逮，所以資金週轉，難免要捉襟見肘了。</p>

<p>本市金融市况，最近一遇仍在劇烈波動中演變，尤以週初情勢更為紊亂，投機者之鼓動，較前益為類目，市塲流言籠罩，人心不定，大有不可收拾之勢。黃金暗市達百三十關最高峯，其漲勢之厲，為過去所未見。其他紋銀·公債·華股·均起驚人漲風，交易呈有買無賣之勞。旋經金融有關當局極力抑止，嚴密取締，週二海風雖堅稍平戰，但人仍看高，持貨者監不吐出，其勢依然緊張，黃金賂回即升，華股熱門票面仍有漲停板者，公價欲降不能。週三多頭止進，散戶亦不敢吸收，市見回定，黃金步退百關內，華股公價亦見略疲。週四一度再降後，午後重起漲風。週五貨金又見百十關以上，公偵稍高，其勢尙平，華股則普遍上升，尤其過去無人間津之小股票，大多數均因購進踴躍而起漲風，七因漲度過高而停板者，不下數十種之多。反之，如美亞永安等熱門股，無力再向上升，投機股票市儈轉移目光購吸其他小票面股票，因而一般股票乘機活躍市塲，故在週六上半日市况中，黃金紋銀公債回跌聲中，小票面華股仍有漲停板者，其美亞，水安等熱門股市，反而劇回甚勁。至於工商各業方面，上週間亦呈久蠻思動，一般擁資者以黃金公債華股風波演變已久，當局取締恐更加嚴密，大勞已去遂利用黃金，活動於物資方面之購囤，兼一般人心認為黃金漲勢已達頂峯，其他各種商品，當須隨金價之比例而高漲，是以，主要食用商品中之米糧黑市價一躍而起一八大關，高起約一倍之譜，麵粉食油及雜糧亦均隨之高漲，此外各業商號門市售價，亦一致增加標價，加呢絨·履革·紙張·棉織品約加百分之三十至四十，週三以後當局對物價之無理上漲，加以嚴密澈查取締後，即漸趨回跌。米價黑市降至十大關左右，最高白米約在十二關。</p>

<p>昨日本報第二版，本市統一救國運動民衆大會新明內，陳彬龢演詞中有「口頭上說是反對重慶」一句，係「口頭上說是擁護重慶「之誤，應更正為：「現在上海有一部份領導人物，仍舊保持他們的目私·消極·取巧的態度，口頭上說是擁護重慶，實際上則在和平區用戰時一切機會，求取暴利時一切投機，這種人根本沒有國家觀念，社會觀念，不但我們要排除他們，就是重慶方面也不見得會寬容他們的。」</p>

<h3 id="c42">希望社會熱心人士　協助感化犯人工作　李處長廣播防犯意義 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>警察局第三處長李時雨於二十日晚七時半假上海電台廣播，題為「為罪犯們呼緬」，大意如次：</p>
<p>立法意義在求改悔　我們知道，犯了罪的人，在一般人看來是可惡的，是不可饒恕的，是不該同情的，更用不着替他們打算，還替他做什麽呼籲呢？國家設定刑罰，是要制裁犯罪的人，誰觸犯了國家刑法，便應受刑罰的制裁，這是毫無疑義的。然而在刑事政策進步的今天，刑罰的目的不在於報復，也不在鎭壓，而是要使犯人深自反省的。生命刑是對於實在不能容許在人羣生活的犯罪者，必須剝奪他的生命，這也是出於不得已的。所有自由刑在立法的意義，都是期望犯罪人在執行刑罪時期深自改悔。刑罰雖然拘束了他們身體的自由，都不應該傷害他們身體的康健，而且還要革新他們的思想，增長他們的技能，使他們出獄後成為一個健全善良的國民，正像一個人患了病送入醫院，經過診治看護工作，但要把病根產出，而且要使他恢復健康，成為一個強壯的人。</p>
<p>根本醫治社會病態　在法律的刑事的責任就是山犯罪人自己來負的，然而我們細細硏究，無論在犯罪的動機上，犯罪的因素上，以及犯罪者的環境上都可以發現他們的犯罪，或由於國家敎育缺陷所致，或由於經濟缺陷所致，或由於社會種種不良所致，椒在不能完全歸咎於犯罪者個人，國家社會似乎也應該替他負一大部份的責任。</p>
<p>犯罪已經成為社會的病態，給社會很大的損書，如果我們不從事根本的醫治，一味仇視他們，壓迫他們，這種病將會蔓延而永無消滅的一天。犯罪的人固然對不起國家社會，若是國家社會還是對不起他們，那麼他們一定更仇視國家社會，進而恨怨國家社會，等到刑滿出獄，越發去做反社會的工作。就是他們病死或餓死在監獄裏，他們的病菌便會跟隨無情的空氣傳染給人們。諸位還能記得故司法行政部長張一鵬老先生病死的原因吧，他因為視察上海地方檢察署看守所受了病犯的傳染，生了斑疹傷寒，不治而死。那些犯人說不定還有許多帶着病菌到外面來，社會上不知名的人受着傳染而死的正不知多少呢！</p>
<p>病死犯人數目驚人　我們知道，現在上海市罪犯的總數有四千三百二十四名口，其中病犯共有二百二十九名口，這一個統計的數字，是値得我們注意的。同時屬押尙犯的死亡率非常驚人。監獄方面一月份死亡十二名，二月份二十三各，三月份三十名，四月份二十三名。看守所方面一月份死亡十九名，二月份二十五名，三月三十五名，四月二十名。我們恨據過去的經騐，凡遇天時炎熟，死亡率一定增加，現在正天氣漸熟的時候，時疫又多，而犯人所患的大都是斑疹傷寒，很難聲治。老其患病的原因，一面是為了傳染，主要的是營養不足，空氣不好，缺乏遝動及不常見陽光的緣故。並且病了之後，因為緊師不健全，藥費不充足，所以病死的很多。基於上述各點，我覺得應該由各方面來協力，才能補救此種缺陷。在災難中去拯救可憐的犯人們。</p>
<p>嚴厲禁止虐待犯人　本人常對員警們吿誡，對犯人固然不不予以姑息，應依法盡力偵查，揭發犯罪事實，然而絕不能存有私見或成見，對犯人虐待暴人，感非刑敲問，曾經三申五令，希望員警們了解。同時我們更希望社會人士，加以監督，如遇非刑敲打等情事，出而檢舉，並且希望檢察官推事們在偵訊審理時，能做到迅速確實，而得到公正明允的判決。假使犯人解途監獄執行後，隊注意衛生外，更應有好的敎育，使他們精神得到安慰，身心健全起來，並敎以良好的技能，將來成為有智識有能力的人。同時我籲請社會上有錢有力的人士，劉犯人予以關心，因為政府機關經費支絀，協助衛生當局盡量診治犯人的疾病，減少死亡。最近周市長夫人曾向警察局　押的犯人捐贈大量麵包，如果熱心慈善的人們，能一致效法，那末犯人們是受惠不淺。這種感化性的救濟工作，在防止犯畢上，是有很大的意義的。深盼社會人士一致協力</p>

<p>凡疑有肺病者，不論其毫無痛苦或病象如何，均須用X光檢查。</p>
<p>凡患呼吸器疾病，在三星期以上而未愈者，均須用X光檢查。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Special Attack Forces Attack Day and Night; Fiercely Assault Enemy Mobile Units; US Authorities Admit Severe Damage <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – To compensate for the lack of air power around Okinawa, the enemy Americans are focusing all their efforts on strengthening land-based aircraft at the northern and central airfields on Okinawa Island and reinforcing facilities on the surrounding islands of Okinawa Island, such as Kerama Islands, Tsuken Island, Kamiyama, Mizuna Island, and Ie Island. Enemy warships off Okinawa Island continue their stubborn and foolish movements, firing naval guns. Since the 19th, the enemy forces have shifted to an all-out offensive, continuing their forceful advance, aiming for the island chain, and are continuing to eliminate enemy carrier-based aircraft. On the night of the 21st, they captured a powerful enemy mobile unit southeast of the main island and launched a fierce attack. On the 20th and 21st, they continued to attack the northern and central airfields on the main island, thwarting the enemy's plans. Such fierce attacks by the Japanese army have caused the frontline enemy soldiers to lose their courage and be filled with terror. According to a broadcast by Manro Bauroen on the 12th, the suicidal special attacks of the Japanese army have turned American and Australian soldiers into neurasthenics, frankly admitting the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. The American Secretary of the Navy, Lamorse, also stated that the US Navy was surrounded by several layers of Japanese special attack forces and could not break through the encirclement without incurring cruel and significant sacrifices, expressing fear of the Japanese special attack forces and issuing cries of despair. The US authorities have been concealing the existence of the Japanese special attack forces and the severe damage they have caused, but now they can no longer hide it and are gradually admitting it, which is particularly noteworthy. According to a Washington AP dispatch, casualties among the US forces in the Okinawa operation so far show that naval casualties exceed those of the army for the first time. The fierce attacks by the Japanese special attack forces have inflicted great damage on enemy warships. The damage inflicted on the enemy by such fierce attacks by Japanese attack forces is increasing dramatically, further terrifying the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Kamikaze Squads Rush to Sink Enemy Cruisers <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Naval Base, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The members of the Kamikaze special attack squads here are in high spirits, vowing to annihilate the enemy. Their remarkable achievements have terrified the enemy. Lieutenant Commander Yuji Kuribayashi's squad, which received orders to sortie on the 6th, directed all its aircraft to attack enemy warships in Nakagusuku Bay on Okinawa Island. At a certain time, the third aircraft of Kuribayashi's squad radioed the command post: "One enemy cruiser has been sunk by our forces." Then, the fourth aircraft also reported sinking one. The command post erupted in cheers. In an instant, Commander Kuribayashi radioed that an enemy large transport ship had been sunk, and the command post was even more delighted. Another small squad led by Lieutenant Kazuo Matsushita also used accurate and courageous torpedo attacks, sinking an enemy cruiser off the eastern coast of Okinawa Island. He then leisurely returned to his base with his fellow aircraft. According to Lieutenant Matsushita, regarding the heroic sortie of the torpedo plane, "As we approached Okinawa Island, it began to drizzle, so we quickly descended and plunged into the decisive battle. A certain number of nautical miles from Okinawa, we spotted an enemy patrol boat, which immediately bombarded our aircraft with anti-aircraft fire. In order to avoid the bullets, I flew up and down, thinking that the enemy was truly fierce. The enemy then shone a searchlight directly on our aircraft, adding to the artillery fire. I carelessly took a bullet in my right hand and was injured, but I endured the pain and continued to fly forward. Just then, I suddenly spotted an enemy cruiser, and its course was still clearly discernible, which could be called divine assistance. With a determination to die, I immediately launched a torpedo. In an instant, a small white column shot straight into the air from the southeast, hitting its stern. It sank into the sea in an instant."</p>

<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since the morning of the 19th, enemy forces in the northern district of southern Okinawa Island have launched an all-out offensive with a force of approximately 10,000 troops. On the 21st, they continued to attack on all fronts under the cover of intense artillery fire, launching wave-like attacks with tanks and powerful units. The enemy's main attack focus has shifted to the west coast. Japanese frontline troops attacked enemy camps at night, repelling them, and are still securing the frontline positions south of Tsushima, north of Iruku, and north of Kashiki, fighting valiantly. Meanwhile, Japanese air units around Okinawa Island carried out daring attacks from the night of the 20th to dawn on the 21st. The additional confirmed battle results are that at 9:30 PM on the 20th, there were nine columns of fire around the Kerama Islands, and at 1:00 AM on the 21st, there were seven columns of fire off Kadena.</p>
<p>Naval Base, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since the 19th, enemy warship groups have approached the Minatogawa area in southern Okinawa Island, attempting to land. The elite Japanese forces repelled them at the coast, and their morale is high. Although they have repeatedly punished the enemy and inflicted great damage, the enemy stubbornly attacked the west coast again from the morning of the 20th. The Japanese army is using a tactic of luring the enemy while reorganizing the battle lines. Currently, the war stretches from the Mekama Makiminato area to the Kakazu Nishihara Heights, and both sides are facing off. The Japanese army's counterattack is currently extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – Regarding the Okinawa battle situation, according to frontline base news, the US military has deployed the 2nd Division on the west coast, the 7th Division on the east coast, and the 96th Division in the center, attempting to advance south simultaneously. Their desire to advance on the Naha area and its two airfields is even stronger, but due to Japanese resistance, the battle situation is not progressing smoothly. The 96th Division is currently facing the most intense Japanese resistance.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Approximately 40 P-51 fighter planes from Iwo Jima, guided by B-29 aircraft, raided the Japanese Tokai region from 11:00 AM on the 22nd, strafing factories and other facilities. However, the Japanese side sustained extremely minor damage. Details of the Japanese forces' interception results are currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Around 6:00 AM on the 22nd, approximately 100 enemy B-29 aircraft, with a main force of about 70, took off from Mariana bases and invaded the southern Kyushu region from the Osumi and Satsuma peninsulas. Another part, about 30 aircraft, passed Cape Ashizuri and circled over the western Shikoku region, then invaded the Oita region for about three hours, carrying out attacks and bombings. Apart from some fires, the Japanese side sustained very minor damage. However, a portion of the 30 enemy aircraft that attacked the northern Kyushu Oita region detoured through the Miyazaki region near Cape Toi and then retreated. In addition, approximately 30 enemy carrier-based aircraft simultaneously invaded Kagoshima Prefecture from the Satsuma Peninsula, circled over the northern region and the southern part of Kumamoto Prefecture, and then retreated unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Taipei, 22nd (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 20th, several enemy bombers invaded Taipei City, dropping several incendiary bombs, and retreated at 2:30 AM.</p>

On the morning of the 20th, approximately 20 B-24 and P-38 aircraft raided the Tarakan area. On the morning of the 21st, approximately 30 B-24 aircraft raided Palembang. Japanese units and air units cooperated to inflict considerable damage.</p>

<p>The focus of the current Pacific War situation is the battle for Okinawa Island. Observing the enemy's recent strategic intentions, the biggest goal of the enemy's US high command is to not only capture Berlin and resolve the European war by April 25th, but also to capture Okinawa and attempt to land on Kyushu, thereby simultaneously subduing Japan. Only when these two ambitions are fulfilled can the United States hold the reins of the Allied powers at the San Francisco Conference and become the leader of the postwar world organization. As for other anti-Axis countries, they are trying to capture Berlin before April 25th and then discuss the strategic focus of the East Asian war situation at the San Francisco Conference to deal with Japan. According to the current trend, the enemy Americans have to take a step back and abandon the fantasy of simultaneously resolving the eastern and western fronts, and instead follow the latter attempt. However, in order to show that they have the strength to win in East Asia, they will make some progress in East Asia before or during the San Francisco Conference, so that their future international position will not be suppressed by the Soviet Union. Of course, our ally Japan will never allow the enemy Americans to achieve this ambition today. Therefore, the battle centered on the Battle of Okinawa is proceeding intensely and is attracting worldwide attention.</p>
<p>The enemy Americans began invading the Ryukyu Islands from Iwo Jima on March 17th, evolving into the Battle of Okinawa. They have assembled a large number of landing craft and more than 300 warships for this battle. Their strategy is to massively bomb Japan's Kyushu and other places with air power to restrain the Japanese mainland air force from reinforcing the front, and to continuously bomb Taiwan and our country's coast to prevent and destroy transportation links between Japan and the mainland and Southeast Asia, and then advance their main naval force toward Okinawa Island. The enemy Americans' initial battle against the Japanese mainland has thus begun. Their ambition, of course, is not limited to the occupation of Okinawa Island or a few islands, but also to lure the entire Japanese navy to come out and strike a major blow.</p>
<p>However, the enemy's fantasy of a quick victory has been shattered by the counterattacks of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, especially the special attack forces. The war has lasted for more than a month, and not only is the enemy's attempt impossible to achieve, but on the contrary, six enemy divisions are trapped on the island and cannot be used to start battles in Kyushu or elsewhere. On the 18th of this month, the enemy Americans launched a general attack on Okinawa, as a struggle to gain face for the United States before the San Francisco Conference after Roosevelt's death, and it contains an even greater element of desperate adventure. The expansion of the scale of air raids on the Japanese mainland and the request for British cooperation fully prove its ambition.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Conference, which the anti-Axis side has been promoting for a long time, will be held soon. The enemy's entire conspiracy is on full display, and it is not far away. Today, the center of the enemy's propaganda is nothing more than first, after the end of the European war, European forces will be transferred to fight in Asia; second, after the San Francisco Conference, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the East Asian war will change; and third, when the entire new international situation unfolds, the anti-Axis alliance will deal with Japan. However, we observe the current reality, and the enemy's attempt is, after all, just a propaganda strategy and will not have a decisive effect. At the same time, we can only unite the total power of the 1 billion people of East Asia to crush the enemy's propaganda strategy.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Weekly War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The weekly war situation in Greater East Asia is as follows:</p>
<p>Okinawa Front: The land battle situation on Okinawa Island remains fierce. In the past thirteen days, the enemy has not been able to advance a single step and is in a stalemate. To break this situation, the enemy is attempting to seize the northern and central airfields and the airfield on the Kerama Islands to advance to the northern part of Okinawa Island. At the same time, they landed on Kamiyama Island, Tsuken Island, and the satellite island of Ie, and landed on Minna Island on the 16th, taking an encirclement approach to the main Japanese positions in the south. Also, in order to cover the landing forces, they continuously fired from ships, with more than 550 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacking various island bases around the 17th, about 350 on the 18th, and about 650 on the 19th. After the 17th, B-24 and P-40 land-based aircraft participated in the attack on Japanese bases on Okinawa and nearby islands, indicating that the enemy has begun to use land-based bases in that area. Also, enemy aircraft in groups of 20 to 30 are often in the skies above the Japanese positions in the south to assist in land operations. The Japanese Kamikaze special attack forces and other air units brave adverse weather, sortie day and night, and fiercely attack enemy mobile units, ships around the island, and land units, sinking and destroying more than 400 enemy ships. The enemy is still reorganizing the remnants and holding on to the landing forces and supply lines. On the 15th and 16th, about 100 carrier-based aircraft raided southern Kyushu, but the scale was very small, which shows that the enemy mobile units have suffered greatly from Japanese attacks. To replenish the mobile units, B-29 aircraft were transferred from the Mariana Islands to the Kyushu area, and P-51 aircraft were transferred from Iwo Jima, specializing in strategic bombing. Today, the air power of both sides in the Ryukyu Islands remains evenly matched, and the outcome of the war will be dominated by the consumption of aircraft.</p>
<p>Mariana Islands: In the Mariana Islands, B-29, P-51, and other enemy aircraft have been shifted to the Kyushu area from Wednesday to assist in direct operations and to supplement the deficiency in air power. Especially the attacks by P-51 aircraft prove that the enemy's preparations on Iwo Jima have gradually been completed. These small aircraft cannot cause large-scale destruction, but in the future they may disrupt the Japanese rear and hinder production. In addition, the B-17, B-24, P-38, and other medium and small aircraft that the enemy has used in Europe are now also planned to be used in East Asia. It is reported that the enemy has stopped manufacturing B-29 and B-32 large aircraft and has begun to issue these types of medium and small aircraft.</p>
<p>Philippines: Enemy ship movements in the Philippine Sea are gradually becoming active. After the middle of the month, a small number of enemy troops landed on Talisay Island in Mindanao. Also, on the west coast of the island, in the Cotabato area, the enemy mobilized battleships and cruisers, opened fire, and then dispatched powerful units to land. Fierce battles are currently underway. On Luzon, the morale of the Japanese troops in various places is high, causing the enemy to bleed heavily. The current fierce battles are taking place in the mountainous area west of Baguio, and there are also fierce battles around Laguna de Bay.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific: Enemy air raids have become rare. In the Balikpapan and Tarakan areas on the east coast of Borneo, there are still a small number of enemy aircraft raids.</p>
<p>Burma: In northern Burma, the Japanese army is reorganizing its forces near Mount Kamaing and has come into contact with the enemy forces advancing south. Also, in central Burma, on the 17th, the enemy mobilized 100 tanks and invaded the area near Schwedaung, about 80 kilometers south of Meiktila. The enemy at Kokeoman, about 60 kilometers west of Meiktila, also launched an offensive on the same day. The Japanese army is engaging them in battle.</p>
<p>Indian Ocean: In the Indian Ocean, on the 14th, British mobile units raided Nias Island west of Sumatra and engaged the Japanese garrison in battle. The strength of the enemy's attack this time was very weak.</p>

<p>— Tadahisa Matsudaira</p>
<p>Truman will likely not experience much change in the short term, but it is easy to imagine that difficult issues from various sides will arise in succession after a considerable period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Heavy Difficulties in Diplomacy and Military Affairs <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The first major issue is probably diplomacy. In the past, American foreign policy was decided by the president alone, treating Stimson like a foreign secretary. However, Truman has never experienced the diplomatic arena. He was incoherent when he met with Churchill and Stalin before, only speaking about irrelevant matters. I am afraid that the ambassadors from various countries in Washington will not respect him either. Therefore, American diplomacy will only decline in the future, and the power of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will be strengthened. The president's position in diplomacy will inevitably plummet, and America's national prestige will undoubtedly decline.</p>
<p>Secondly, he cannot control the army and navy, which will cause a lack of unity between the government and the military. The American president is the commander-in-chief of the army and navy, and generals such as Stimson, Forrestal, King, Eisenhower, Nimitz, and MacArthur were all under his command. Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during World War I, and his ability and political experience were enough to make these army and navy generals willingly obey him. But what about Truman? He only became an army captain during World War I, and his qualifications are very shallow. Of course, he is not respected by the generals. Truman has only the empty title of president, and his position is higher than theirs. Because of this, the military and the government cannot coordinate, and the army and navy may also lose their coordination.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Congress is the Most Difficult to Deal With <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Regarding domestic unity in the United States, I am also worried for them. Able cabinet members such as Wallace, Morgenthau, and Ickes, whether in terms of their party experience or their abilities, are beyond Truman's reach. Especially Wallace, who was the vice president before, is he willing to agree to everything and submit to Truman? According to foreign news reports, many members of the cabinet have decided to resign, and from my point of view, this is inevitable. Because no matter how much you want to contribute to the country, who wants to be instructed by a Missourian hick? Therefore, I expect internal rifts to occur. Observing this, Truman finds that the most difficult thing to deal with is probably Congress. As mentioned above, Congress can restrain the president's powers. If there is a capable president, Congress can tolerate the president's dictatorial power, but for such a mediocre president, of course, he cannot be given such strong dictatorial power. Even if Truman wants to announce wartime laws to make operations run more smoothly, Congress will not grant him this power because of his insufficient ability. Also, Congress will reject and not pass the various important policies implemented by the president at any time. But I think Truman, in order to avoid friction with Congress and avoid trouble, will extremely respect the opinions of Congress and adopt a soft, indecisive attitude, gradually fading the wartime political color of the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Truman is Bound to Fail <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Foreign news dispatches have made the following criticism: The final difficulty that Truman encounters is the difficulty of reconciling the two matters of ensuring national livelihood and replenishing military needs. The lives of the American people have become unbearable. Due to labor shortages, malignant inflation is becoming increasingly serious, transportation capacity is lacking, and essential living supplies are severely depleted. The lives of the people are heavily threatened. Although they have increased the full amount of the allowance for the families of fallen soldiers, the social unrest has reached a point where it cannot be concealed. In order to alleviate this situation, the government hopes that the European war will end soon and assures the people that it will increase civilian supplies. It has decided to convert one-third of the army's military industry to civilian industry after the war, but whether it can be realized is a big question. According to Eisenhower, the commander of the anti-Axis forces on the Western Front, the war against Germany has gradually turned into a guerrilla war, so the future of the war does not allow us to be optimistic. It will take a considerable amount of time to eliminate this guerrilla war, so the American army and navy still hope to continue to supply weapons, bullets, ships, and aircraft. The government's statement that military factories will be restored to civilian factories is ultimately difficult. Roosevelt also went through many twists and turns for this problem, and the director of the wartime production bureau, Nelson, also resigned because the matter could not be resolved. Can today's Truman withstand it? (The End)</p>

<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since the Wartime People's Representative Conference of various provinces and cities was enthusiastically held in Beijing on March 28th, the people of the country have risen up and universally launched the National Salvation Movement, fully expressing the people's spontaneous awareness of their love for the country. On the 21st, various parts of the country held National Salvation Movement People's Congresses, and the enthusiasm was extremely high. President Chen of the National Government specially issued the following statement on this matter: Yesterday, the people of various provinces and cities held National Salvation Movement People's Congresses to support the resolutions of the Representative Congress on the 28th of last month, which shows the enthusiasm of the people of the country and the value of the representative resolutions. Among them, matters such as anti-communism, strengthening self-defense, forming a people's representative body, guaranteeing freedom of speech, circulating materials, and stabilizing livelihood are particularly urgent and are also the beginning of national policy. At the beginning of the return to the capital, anti-communism and peace have long become iron laws. The implementation of constitutional government has already established a special committee to start planning. Guaranteeing freedom of speech is not a problem. The circulation of materials is not yet satisfactory due to the wartime situation, but the competent authorities are constantly adjusting it, and the results are gradually becoming apparent. All of this is of great concern to the government. Now that the expectations of the people have been established, the measures in the future will be easier. We must know that the people are the foundation of the country. The government will do its best to meet the opinions of the majority of the people. We must supervise the environment, weigh the urgency, and have the central government evaluate the plans and proceed in order.</p>

<p>Lisbon, April 22nd, Central News Agency dispatch from Washington: Prior to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's arrival in Washington, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius on the 21st, focusing on the Polish question and exchanging various opinions. After the meeting, Eden declared that Britain and America were in complete agreement on all issues. From this, it is clear that Eden and Stettinius have already formed a united front to counter Molotov's intentions. Representatives of other anti-Axis nations have departed for San Francisco. U.S. President Truman has decided to deliver a ten-minute broadcast speech from the White House before the San Francisco Conference.</p>

<p>Zurich, April 21st, Central News Agency dispatch quoting a Reuters reporter on the 21st: Marshal Stalin is now personally directing Soviet forces operating on the Berlin front from a field headquarters. The First Belorussian Army and the First Ukrainian Army have practically merged into a central army group. The reporter believes that Stalin's appearance at the front lines is due to the impending meeting of Soviet forces with the anti-Axis armies on the Western Front.  Complex and delicate issues will arise after the meeting, hence his personal presence at the front to handle everything.</p>
<p>Berlin, April 22nd, Central News Agency dispatch: Reuters dispatch: Soviet forces are attempting to encircle Berlin, with their flanks gradually closing in on the German capital. In the northeast, east, and south of the city, Soviet vanguard units have reached the suburbs of Berlin: Bernau, Strasburg, Fürstenwalde, Königs Wusterhausen, and Zossen. The German army is putting up fierce defensive battles against the numerically superior Soviet forces, with Soviet progress being minimal. The Soviet army is no longer attempting direct frontal assaults, but is focusing on its flanks. The German front lines east and northeast of Berlin are sufficient to withstand Soviet breakthrough attempts, but are forced to retreat closer to Berlin.</p>

<p>Lisbon, April 21st, Central News Agency dispatch from Paris: Chief of Staff of the Supreme Headquarters of the Anti-Axis Forces in Europe, Smith, met with a group of reporters on the 21st and made the following statement: Although the German army has lost its organized resistance, it can still hold onto mountainous areas and is determined to fight to the end. Therefore, the war may not end soon. The anti-Axis forces should be even more aware of the harshness and enormous losses of the war ahead.

<p>Zurich, April 22nd, Central News Agency dispatch from the front lines: It is reported that the vanguard of the U.S. Second Army broke into the outskirts of Hamburg on the 21st. The right wing of the Canadian army also seems to have gained a foothold within the German defense line between Bremen and Eschön. The movements of the U.S. Ninth Army and First Army are unclear due to the U.S. authorities prohibiting reporting, but it is only known that the German and American armies are engaged in a major battle south of Taillo. In addition, the U.S. Third Army occupied Asch, and the U.S. Seventh Army and French First Army successfully encircled Stuttgart completely on the 21st. The Southern French army has occupied Donaueschingen, 50 kilometers east of Freiburg, and reached a tributary of the Danube.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Overview of the Capital's Financial Industry <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— By Ren Ping</p>
<h3 id="e29">Emerging Like Bamboo Shoots after Rain <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>It is strange that in Nanjing, the financial industry, in recent years of extreme economic fatigue, new banks and money shops have sprung up one after another. Banks and money shops, in theory, should bear the mission of supporting industry and commerce and regulating the social economy, but in recent years, it is doubtful whether the Nanjing banking and money shop industries, which have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, have made any contribution to the above-mentioned mission.</p>
<p>The concentration of banks and money shops in the capital is in the triangle area of Zhonghua Road, Jiankang Road, and Zhuque Road. The sight of one every three or four steps is eye-catching, and it is common to see money shops being converted into banks, with brand-new high-rise buildings rising up.</p>
<p>According to current statistics, in addition to one national bank, there are currently 56 banks and 117 money shops and pawn shops. At the same time, there are still ongoing preparations for opening new ones; although the financial authorities have long restricted the issuance of licenses, in reality, the devil always outsmarts the saint. Observing the content and business of these small banks and small money shops, most are bleak and pitiful, and the so-called golden age is long gone.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Implementing Strengthening of Finance <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The direct administrative body for the banking and money shop industries is the Nanjing branch of the Central Financial Affairs Inspection Office. In November of last year, it was ordered to strengthen the financial industry and promulgated the "Outline for Strengthening the Operations of Financial Institutions" to rectify general unsound financial institutions, and limited all banks and money shops to increase their capital or merge within three months. The minimum capital of each bank was increased from 6 million yuan to 10 million yuan, with 5 million yuan actually paid up. The minimum capital of money shops was increased from 4 million yuan to 6 million yuan, with half actually paid up. Currently, the bank with the highest capital is the Huaxing Commercial Bank, with an actual paid-up capital of 50 million yuan; while there are still several banks whose minimum actual paid-up capital is less than the stipulated 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>The strengthening work began on February 22 of this year, and restrictions were placed on loans. Loans to individuals must not exceed 200,000 yuan, and loans to companies, businesses, and factories must not exceed 2 million yuan. Loans exceeding 2 million yuan must be applied for approval before they can be issued. On the other hand, emphasis is placed on filling out various forms and reports, with more than 20 types of daily or monthly reports on loans and deposits of various types.</p>
<p>As for deposit reserve funds, they are still handled according to past methods, stipulating 10% for current accounts and 5% for fixed deposits, which are paid to the Central Bank. The deposit is based on the total amount of deposits in each bank and money shop each day, as the sole guarantee for depositors.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Establishing Preparation Libraries <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The banking and money shop industries each have their own collective organizations, with industry associations. Ge Liang is responsible for convening the Banking Industry Association, and Tang Shaoheng is responsible for the Money Shop Industry Association.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to develop finance and regulate inter-bank lending, the banking and money shop industries have also formed a Banking Industry Joint Reserve Library and a Money Shop Industry Joint Reserve Library. Fifty-one units participated in the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Library, each paying a reserve fund of 250,000 yuan, and borrowing 20 million yuan from the Central Reserve Bank. The banking and money shop industries also have a check clearing house in the Central Reserve Bank. Every afternoon, members are sent by the banks and money shops to exchange checks.</p>

<p>The pawn of goods is also a major event for the banking and money shop industries. In order to achieve effective price management, the Nanjing Municipal Government promulgated "Measures for the Pledge of Goods", ordering the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations to restrict the goods pledged by stores to banks and money shops to no more than seven-tenths of the collateral. However, it is permissible to first accept the pledge and then, on the next day, submit a list of store names, types and quantities of collateral, current value, and amount of the pledge to the Municipal Government for review. If pledges are made privately without reporting or exceeding the prescribed amount, strict penalties will be imposed if discovered.</p>
<p>As far as the current number of financial institutions in Nanjing is concerned, it has exceeded the actual demand. There are too many that are crude and shoddy, especially many fragile small banks and money shops. It can be said that there are very few legitimate businesses such as remittance, deposit, lending, and mortgage. Most of them are a pretext for engaging in some illegal operations such as speculative activities, in order to maintain expenses. As for investment in general agriculture and industry, they all feel that they are unable to do so, so it is inevitable that capital turnover will be stretched.</p>

<p>In order to enable the general public of this city to have a deep understanding of the current situation at a time when the world war is becoming increasingly fierce, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association held a current affairs lecture at the Dahua Theater yesterday (the 22nd) morning at 10:00 AM. Students from major middle schools in the city were invited to attend. Yang Guangzheng, editor of the "Shen Bao Monthly," was invited to give the lecture. More than 1,000 students from various schools in the city attended the lecture.</p>
<p>The lecture began on time with a speech by Chairman Lu Wanyi who said: "Today, when the world is in extraordinary turmoil, the Pacific War has approached the Japanese mainland and China, and Europe has reached the decisive stage. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the Association has specially held this current affairs lecture with three aims: 1. To promote the accurate understanding of news by citizens. 2. To promote wartime emotions and enhance work efficiency among citizens. 3. To awaken intellectuals in key positions to jointly shoulder the mission of uniting and saving the country."

<p>Previously, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce conducted an investigation of its affiliated trade associations by the Investigation Department in order to understand the current situation of each member. This work has now been completed, and it is beginning to prepare a statistical table of the status of the trade associations and submit a report as follows: The Investigation Department investigated the status of the trade associations, prepared and distributed forms. Except for ten associations that did not submit the forms, the others submitted them to the association. The statistical table of the status of the trade associations has been prepared, with a total of 257 trade associations, a total of 89,080 members, and a total of 1,784,739 members' employees.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Planned Construction of Trunk Roads Directly to the North Station in Western and Southern Shanghai: The Construction Bureau Requests Approval from the Municipal Government <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau stated that the road administration in the various districts of the city has always been perfect, but after the situation changed, the supply of road construction materials was exhausted, and it was especially difficult to prepare the economic funds, so the maintenance projects and the plans to improve the road administration in the various districts have not been able to be fully implemented. In order to actively promote the city's road administration, the bureau is now striving to address the above-mentioned issues. After sending personnel to investigate, it was found that the traffic near the North Station is extremely frequent, especially with the current congestion of vehicles. The width of the original roads is insufficient, which is inconvenient for travelers. Therefore, it is planning to open trunk roads directly to the North Station from the western and southern districts of Shanghai in order to facilitate travel. It is currently preparing a detailed plan and submitting it to the Municipal Government. Construction will begin as soon as the budget is approved.</p>

<p>Five dance halls in the Changning District of western Shanghai are doing booming business, so they often exceed the limited business hours. The director of the district branch, Yao Benyuan, investigated and dealt with them several times. Recently, it was heard that the dance halls were still operating overtime. Therefore, he secretly dispatched police officers and several policemen to patrol last night. As a result, it was discovered that the Country Inn and Argentina were still having guests. Manli Weituo was brightly lit and in further violation of the blackout regulations. Strict measures have been taken against them.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Last Week's Financial Fluctuations Were Drastic <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The financial situation in this city has recently been undergoing drastic fluctuations. Especially at the beginning of the week, the situation was even more chaotic, and the instigation of speculators was more frequent than before. Rumors shrouded the market, and people were unsettled, with an uncontrollable momentum. The black market for gold reached a peak of 130 marks, with an unprecedented rise. Other silver, public bonds, and Chinese stocks all experienced alarming price increases, with transactions showing a lack of sellers. After the financial authorities stepped in to suppress and strictly prohibit transactions, the sea breeze on Tuesday was slightly calmer, but people were still bullish and holders refused to release their goods. The situation remained tense, and the price of gold rose again. The popular Chinese stocks still had price limits, and public prices could not be lowered. On Wednesday, the bulls stopped advancing, and retail investors did not dare to absorb them. The market saw a correction, and gold retreated within 100 marks. Public prices for Chinese stocks also showed slight fatigue. After falling again on Thursday, the rising tide resumed in the afternoon. On Friday, gold was again above 110 marks, public bonds were slightly higher, and the momentum was still flat, but Chinese stocks generally rose, especially small stocks with no attention in the past, most of which rose due to enthusiastic purchases, and no fewer than dozens were suspended from trading due to excessive gains. On the other hand, popular stocks such as Mayar and Wing On were unable to rise further, and speculators shifted their attention to other small-value stocks, thus activating the general stock market. Therefore, in the first half of Saturday's market, amid the decline in gold, silver, and public bonds, small-value Chinese stocks still had price limits. The popular stocks, such as Mayar and Wing On, experienced severe declines. As for industry and commerce, there was also a hint of activity last week. Generally, those with funds took advantage of the long-standing gold, public bond, and Chinese stock turmoil. The authorities' suppression was expected to be stricter, so they used the gold to purchase and hoard materials. At the same time, the general public believed that the rise in gold prices had reached its peak, and that other commodities should rise in proportion to the price of gold. As a result, the black market price of rice, a major food commodity, jumped by 18 marks, about double the price. Flour, cooking oil, and miscellaneous grains also rose sharply. In addition, the retail prices of shops in various industries were uniformly increased. Woolen fabrics, leather goods, paper, and cotton textiles were increased by about 30% to 40%. After the authorities strictly investigated and prohibited unreasonable price increases after Wednesday, they gradually declined. The black market price of rice fell to around 10 marks, and the highest-quality rice was about 12 marks.</p>
<p>Important Correction</p>
<p>Yesterday on the second page of this newspaper, in the report of the Mass Rally of the National Salvation Movement, the sentence "saying in their mouths that they oppose Chongqing" in Chen Binhe's speech was a mistake for "saying in their mouths that they support Chongqing". It should be corrected to: "There are still some leaders in Shanghai who maintain their selfish, passive, and opportunistic attitude, saying in their mouths that they support Chongqing, but in fact they are using every opportunity in the peaceful area to seek windfall profits and engage in all kinds of speculation. These people have no national concept or social concept at all. Not only do we want to exclude them, but Chongqing is unlikely to tolerate them either."</p>
<h3 id="e42">The Hubei Native Association Again Appeals for Relief to Hankou Disaster Victims; Hoping Enthusiastic People Will Generously Donate <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Hankou has suffered repeated bombings by American planes, and the disaster victims are in urgent need of relief. The Hubei Native Association in Shanghai has specifically established a Relief Undertaking Committee. The chairman of the committee is Wang Shaocheng, and the standing committee members are Lu Xingjie, Lu Chuseng, Liu Jingzai, Li Chen, Li Ding'an, Zhang Liangdong, Yang Shaojing, Qin Runsheng, Xiong Juju, Tan Mingqi, etc. They appeal for relief to the Wuhan disaster victims and raise donations, with a brief announcement as follows:</p>
<p>Wuhan is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, connecting the transportation hub between north and south, and gathering merchants from all over the world. It is one of the four major commercial ports in our country, with a population of over one million. About 30% are from this province, and about 70% are from other provinces, mostly from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, followed by Fujian and Guangdong, and then Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Korea, and other provinces. Recently, it has suffered repeated air raids, and the disaster situation is extremely severe. The prosperous urban areas have been turned into rubble, and people have broken bones and severed arms, supporting the old and carrying the young, exposed to the wind and sleeping in the open, with no home to return to. This association, based on the principle of human mutual assistance and the deep bond of kinship, has launched a fundraising campaign to engage in relief work, with fellow provincials soliciting donations in different ways. However, due to the vastness of the disaster area and the large number of survivors, even with all our efforts, it is difficult to provide universal relief. After repeated consideration, we can only appeal to various charitable organizations and great philanthropists in Shanghai, pleading for the disaster victims. It is said that saving a life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda. We earnestly implore all great philanthropists to have compassion and generously donate, and also ask them to widely solicit donations, the more the better, so that we can gather sand into a tower and collect fur into a robe, benefiting the disaster victims and bestowing upon them an kindness equal to rebirth. Once the donations are collected, we will immediately send personnel to Hankou to work with local authorities and charitable organizations to distribute the funds appropriately, ensuring that the funds are not wasted and the people receive tangible benefits. When the work is completed, we will publish it in the newspapers to provide credibility. We lay out our appeal sincerely, hoping for your kind consideration. Hubei Native Association Shanghai Relief Undertaking Committee.</p>

<p>The International Cup soccer final, Italy versus Northern Europe, was performed at the racecourse yesterday starting at 10 o'clock. Because it belonged to the world of foreigners, there were not many spectators. The battle situation was very tense. As a result, with a score of one to zero, the Italian army won the throne. Although Northern Europe was defeated, its performance was excellent. It was different from the luck of the ball. It shot at the empty goal twice, both hitting the crossbar and bouncing out. Although the Italian army was able to win, according to its combat situation, it failed to meet its past standards. Referee Zhong Xiurong, the first half resulted in each keeping their virginity. In the midst of the second battle, Tekni near the goal shot hard in the ninth minute, going straight into the net, recording the opening. Then Northern Europe attacked hard. Fuen pulled the door from 20 yards away. At that time, Mai had already left, but unexpectedly, it hit the crossbar and bounced out again. Before the time expired, Northern Europe lost with a score of zero to one.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Hoping for Social Enthusiasts to Assist with Prisoner Rehabilitation Work; Director Li Broadcasts the Meaning of Crime Prevention <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Li Shiyu, Director of the Third Department of the Police Bureau, broadcasted on the Shanghai Radio Station at 7:30 p.m. on the 20th, titled "Calling for Sympathy for Criminals," with the following main points:</p>
<p>The Meaning of Legislation Lies in Seeking Repentance. We know that, in the eyes of ordinary people, those who have committed crimes are hateful, unforgivable, and undeserving of sympathy. There is no need to plan for them, let alone appeal for them. The state sets penalties to punish criminals. Whoever violates the national criminal law should be subject to criminal penalties. This is undoubtedly true. However, in today's advanced criminal policy, the purpose of punishment is not revenge or suppression, but to make criminals deeply reflect on themselves. Capital punishment is for criminals who cannot be tolerated in human society, and it is necessary to deprive them of their lives, which is also out of necessity. The legislative meaning of all imprisonments is to hope that criminals will deeply repent during the execution of their sentences. Although penalties restrict their physical freedom, they should not harm their physical health, and should also reform their thinking and increase their skills, so that they can become sound and good citizens after their release from prison, just like a person who is sick and sent to the hospital, after diagnosis and treatment, but also to get rid of the root cause of the disease, and to restore him to health, becoming a strong person.</p>
<p>Fundamentally Cure Social Pathologies. In law, the criminal responsibility rests with the criminal himself. However, upon careful study, we can find that their crimes, whether in the motive, the factors, or the environment of the crime, are due to defects in national education, economic defects, or various social evils. Therefore, they cannot be entirely attributed to the individual criminal. The state and society should also bear a large part of the responsibility for him.</p>
<p>Crime has become a social pathology, causing great damage to society. If we do not engage in fundamental treatment and simply hate and oppress them, this disease will spread and never be eradicated. The criminals have certainly failed the state and society, but if the state and society still fail them, then they will certainly hate the state and society even more, and even resent the state and society. When they are released from prison after serving their sentences, they will do more anti-social work. Even if they die or starve to death in prison, their germs will be transmitted to people through the ruthless air. You can still remember the cause of death of the late Minister of Justice Zhang Yipeng, who died of typhus after being infected by sick prisoners while inspecting the detention center of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate. Those prisoners may also carry many germs outside, and it is unknown how many nameless people in society have died from infection!</p>
<p>The Number of Prisoners Dying of Illness is Alarming. We know that the total number of criminals in Shanghai is now 4,324, of which 229 are sick. This statistic is worthy of our attention. At the same time, the mortality rate of those awaiting trial is very alarming. In the prison, 12 people died in January, 23 in February, 30 in March, and 23 in April. In the detention center, 19 people died in January, 25 in February, 35 in March, and 20 in April. According to our past experience, the mortality rate will definitely increase when the weather is hot and humid, and now that the weather is gradually getting hotter, there are many epidemics, and most of the prisoners suffer from typhus, which is difficult to treat. The reason for their illness is partly due to infection, but mainly due to insufficient nutrition, poor air, lack of exercise, and infrequent exposure to sunlight. Furthermore, after becoming ill, because the medical system is not sound and the medicine fees are insufficient, many die from illness. Based on the above points, I feel that all parties should work together to remedy this defect, and to rescue the pitiful prisoners in the disaster.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Abuse of Prisoners. I often warn the police that although prisoners should not be condoned, and they should do their best to investigate and expose the facts of the crime according to the law, they must never harbor private opinions or prejudices, abuse or assault prisoners, or use torture to extract confessions. I have repeatedly emphasized this, hoping that the police will understand. At the same time, we hope that people from all walks of life will supervise them. If they encounter torture or assault, they should come forward to report them, and we hope that the prosecutors and judges can be swift and accurate in their interrogation and trial, and make fair and just judgments. If prisoners are transferred to the prison for execution, in addition to paying attention to hygiene, there should be good education so that their spirits are comforted and their bodies and minds are healthy, and they are taught good skills so that they can become knowledgeable and capable people in the future. At the same time, I urge wealthy and powerful people in society to care about prisoners, because the government agencies are short of funds, to assist the health authorities in treating the diseases of prisoners as much as possible, and to reduce deaths. Recently, Mayor Zhou's wife donated a large number of bread to the prisoners detained in the police bureau. If enthusiastic charitable people can emulate this, then the prisoners will benefit a lot. This kind of rehabilitative relief work is of great significance in preventing crime. I deeply hope that people from all walks of life will work together.</p>

<p>Mr. Liu Zhizhi, a staff member of the Shanghai Industrial Bank, in order to respond to this newspaper's free elementary school, has specifically donated 2,000 yuan from his usual savings to the "Free School Fund," and sent a letter expressing his enthusiastic support, with sincere words overflowing with expression. An excerpt is as follows: "When I see the news of your newspaper's Free School Fund every day, I feel unspeakably happy. I believe there is no shortage of enthusiastic people in society to sympathize with those poor students who have been deprived of their schooling, the future masters. Zhizhi, as a small bank employee, although his income is limited, in order to respond to the 'Free School Fund,' he is willing to donate the 2,000 yuan he usually saves from eating and using sparingly to the 'Scholarship Fund,' so that his heart can be temporarily at ease."</p>
<p>Donating Books. Lu Liangjun of the Recreation Department of the Fourth China Vocational Supplementary School Alumni Association sent a letter saying: "Please be informed that I am one of the persons in charge of the former Fourth China Vocational Supplementary School Alumni Association (Recreation Department). Although the association has been closed for many years, there are still some public goods left in the association. Now, because the association's address is being relocated, we are specifically donating the public goods left in this department to your newspaper's free school. The items are: 500 copies of Little Healthy Exercise, two national flags, one burning flag, and cash (converted from scraps of waste paper - three catties) 450 yuan. Please check and issue a receipt."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chen Dexing and Ruan Laixing, students of the Fifth Grade A of Renzhi Elementary School, jointly donated 29 old textbooks, which have been received and used as textbooks for the free school.</p>

<p>The Leprosy Relief Society of this city has been established for 18 years, and over the years has been running around and calling for help for the millions of leprosy patients in our country, such as promoting new methods of treatment, building new-style leprosy hospitals, editing leprosy publications, convening national leprosy conferences, providing medical and spiritual assistance to the poor and sick, preventing the mutilation of lepers, drafting leprosy laws for the government, and promoting isolation to prevent public transmission, etc. In addition to providing economic and spiritual assistance to leprosy hospitals in the country, the association raised funds in 1935 to build its own leprosy sanatorium in Miaohang Town, Dachang, a suburb of Shanghai, with more than 100 acres of land and more than 20 buildings, with a grand scale and complete equipment. Unfortunately, it was not long after its completion that it was hit by the war and moved to a safe area in western Shanghai, where it continued to operate. It has been eight years since then, and the food expenses alone for more than 100 patients require more than one million per month. The funds obtained last year have already been used up, and if we do not continue to find ways, we will inevitably run out of food. For this reason, the association has applied for approval from the authorities to start fundraising from the 25th of this month, hoping to raise 10 million yuan within a month to maintain the work. I hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate and help achieve this good deed.</p>

In addition to preparing refreshments for the joyful gathering, they will also show "The Children's Paradise" and other educational films to add to the fun.

<h3 id="e51">When Should X-Ray Examinations be Conducted - A Prerequisite for Tuberculosis Prevention? <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>We know that all patients with progressive or open lung disease may have no symptoms or pain, so to prevent lung disease, X-ray examinations should be performed frequently to prevent life from being destroyed by tuberculosis bacteria unknowingly.</p>
<p>Then, when should X-ray examinations be performed? According to the opinion of Dr. Brownin of Germany, as follows:</p>
<p>Anyone suspected of having lung disease, regardless of whether they have any pain or symptoms, should undergo an X-ray examination.</p>
<p>Anyone suffering from respiratory diseases that have not healed for more than three weeks should undergo an X-ray examination.</p>
<p>Anyone who has frequently had respiratory diseases in recent years should undergo an X-ray examination.</p>
<p>If a doctor is treating a patient and it is a respiratory disease, an X-ray examination should be performed at the same time as treatment.</p>
<p>In summary, we can draw a certain law, that is, it is a mistake to determine that a person's lungs are healthy without an X-ray examination. In other words, without an X-ray examination, it is impossible to determine that a patient has no lung disease, so for accurate lung health diagnosis, X-ray examination is essential.</p>
<p>Anyone who looks healthy but already has lung disease, or has a respiratory disease and is suspected of having lung disease, should seek medical attention immediately and undergo an X-ray examination. This is of great importance to their personal health and prevention and control, although it is not easy to implement in our country at this time. However, ideals are the mother of success. If all our comrades can promote it as much as possible and cooperate fully, then this measure will surely be realized and succeed one day, and it is also a prerequisite for tuberculosis prevention. The China Health Association is holding half-price examinations in response to Tuberculosis Prevention Week, at 1,000 yuan per person, sold on behalf of this newspaper's Social Service Office, until the end of this month, and will not be extended. The address is 996 Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
