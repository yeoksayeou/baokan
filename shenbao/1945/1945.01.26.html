<h3>日空軍反覆攻擊　雷明兩島敵機塲　明多羅海敵船團亦遭猛炸</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍基地二十五日中央社電　日航空部隊刻於雷伊泰島奮鬥中，呼應日軍將兵之勇戰，由一月一日起至二十二日止，反覆攻擊雷伊泰島及明多羅島敵機塲，已使塔克羅班機塲二十一處，塔拉克機塲一處，塔諾曼機塲三處及桑霍塞北機塲四處起火。</p>

<p>呂宋島上日軍奮戰</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地二十五日中央社電　仁牙因灣東南岸地區敵軍，邇後遭日軍勇敢攻擊，已受重創，然優勢敵軍，曾於二十二日以有力機動部隊反覆攻擊羅沙留周圍日軍陣地，自二十二日以來，每日發射砲彈實達六千餘發之多。反之，日軍則勇敢奮戰，衝入敵陣，使敵之攻擊企圖全成泡影，日軍於二十一·二十二兩日，會在該地區殺傷敵兵四百餘，擊毀敵戰車三十四輛以上，並粉碎或鹵獲其他火砲甚多。敵軍於二十一日使一部兵力在聖特巴巴拉附近登陸，聖法比安正面戰綫敵軍，亦曾砲擊日軍第一錢陣地，一部敵軍卒奪取日第一錢陣地之一角，刻日軍仍在繼續勇敢還聲中。於比拉合友之敵迂迥部隊，於比拉南部地區竟將日軍一部陣地包圍，此項日軍亦在奮戰中。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　呂朱島戰况如次：旁加喜平地東側高地之戰况，無大變化，馬比勞以北之日軍，目下採取守勢。又由第一綫陣地間隙迂迥侵人深索魯比奧之敵軍，因遭四週間日軍之猛攻，其行動遂漸消極。此方面敵軍之兵力，有機械師之第一軍團約三師，敵方登陸軍之主力，一方由仁牙因達古旁方面南下之敵第十四軍團中二師之一師，現沿阿古諸河南進，十五日前後抵達阿古諾河套，其中一都渡河南下，二十日前後，似已侵入呂宋平原中央部，達爾拉克及其東約十入公里之拉巴斯兩地，在仁牙因灣西北之疋鄂諾半島內之疋里諾及其東南之阿拉密諾斯，仁牙因西北約二十公里附近，似有一部敵軍登陸。至於呂朱島之敵軍總兵力，有五師强力，第一軍部十之第六、二十五、四、十三各師並一百五十八聯隊，第十四軍團之二十七、第四十師並一部陸戰隊。仁牙因灣現在仍有敵運輸船團往來，二十日有運轍船二十艘，二十一日有數艘，二十三日亦有相當多數之運輸船入港。</p>
<h3>巴莫代表談話　反駁英草案</h3>
<p>仰光二十四日中央社電　英政府於去年底曾以保守緬甸問題發表處理緬甸之草案，其壓迫弱小民族之奸策，於此已暴露無遺，緬甸民衆聞之，莫不憤槪。緬甸國家代表巴莫氏，二十三日接見日緬印三國新聞記者團時，特對該草案力加反駁，並發表談話如次：英國之草案發表後，緬甸民衆至爲氣慣，一般僧侶及靑年履均一致向政府要求參加戰爭，俾資防衛國土，今政府爲應民衆之願望，特舉全力協力戰爭，而採取戰時之非常措置，故靑年團體不久將實行徵兵制度，各勞力團體亦舉辦勞力之登記。今國民之戰意與英國所宣傳者，完全相反，且較一九四二年驅逐英勢力時，尤爲熾烈，至該草案內有將緬甸於一完期間內置於軍事支配下之計劃，所謂緬甸再建一詞，悉爲英國抑制緬人之圈套，至制定之憲法亦不過欺騙緬人之手段而已。緬甸決不甘爲英國巧語所欺，英國雖以日軍駐屯緬甸爲攻擊之唯一目標，然日軍之目標確在防衛緬甸國士，敵英爲實錢侵略計劃，不惜捏造各種口實，據自北緬敵佔領地區逃脫歸來之一僧侶稱，英軍佔領地區無尊重人權，更無公法，此種政治，唯有榨取而已，故英國之政治政策，於此可知矣。</p>
<h3>日衆院定明日　舉行分科會　臨時軍事費列入預算</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日衆院預算總會，定二十六日質疑完畢，二十七日舉行分科會，共分六科，其分劃如次：第一分科會爲外務。司法。大東亞三省，第二分科會爲內務·厚生兩省，第三分科會爲大藏·文都兩省·第四分科會爲陸·海軍，軍需省，第五分科會爲農商省，第六分科會爲運通省。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日政府於昭和二十年度之一般會計澦算中，列入臨時軍事費特別會計者，通算本澦算追加預算第一號，爲一百另一億一千三百萬元。此外，追加各特別會計費，追加預算之十五億五千六百萬元則共爲一百十六億六千九百萬元，此較十九年度預算之加入，共增加三十二億八千萬元。</p>
<p>陸相報告將士奮戰</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日本衆議院二十四日豫算總會時，小山亮氏質問關於敵軍反攻綫後方各島中活躍之日軍將士現況，當由陸相衫山氏答覆如次：南洋各島陸軍將士雖陳亡十分之三四，並不因而潰滅，且亳不爲之動搖，尤其自瓜達加納爾作戰以來，於南太平洋各地作戰之日軍各部隊，雖在孤島上依然繼續勇鬥，雖至最後一卒，亦必決意奉公，最近培里洗之戰，雖受敵機優勢之攻擊，然日軍仍繼續敢鬥中，此即日軍將士之精神，全員均具有特攻精神，決意報國，以切實戰鬥至最後一卒之決意。</p>
<p>農相宣稱確保配米</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日農商相島田氏，二十五日上午，在衆院澦算總會宜稱：現在配給食米標準量絕對確保，將來亦絕不减低。</p>

<h3>蘇門答臘島　巨港區空戰　擊落商機逾七十八架</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日大本營二十五日發表：一月二十四日上午，敵艦載機約一百二十架，曾來襲蘇門答臘島巨港地區，經當地日軍航空部隊及地上部隊邀擊，擊落敵機達七十入架以上，日機十四架未歸還，地上設施損失輕微。</p>
<h3>伊洛瓦底流域　日軍綜合戰果</h3>
<p>仰光二十五日中央社電　緬甸方面日軍，連日來曾勇猛與雄厚之渝美軍奮戰，自十二月一日至一月十五日間，伊洛瓦底河流域方面之主要綜合戰果大致如左：渝美軍棄屍一四〇四名，俘虜一五〇九名，傷亡六九四〇名，損失戰車十二輛，汽率九十一輛，此外，並被日軍函獲砲火槍支等甚多。</p>
<h3>渝美空軍基地　將澈底覆滅</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　駐渝美空軍邇來對和平區域施行漫無目標之盲炸，民衆對此無不深惡痛絕，敵愾同仇，鬥志愈堅。駐渝美空軍之轟炸目標，據其宣傳，以所謂軍事設施爲主，茲其行動與所宣傳者違反，彼等未顧及中國平民，濫施轟炸，毫無選擇，自日軍去年展開大陸作戰以來，其空軍基地已喪失殆盡，加以最近在太平洋上作戰失利，於其盲炸行動更見加甚，美軍圖以盲炸我同胞之成續，蒙蔽戰敗之事實，用心至爲明顯。惟其駐渝空軍基地已大部喪失，其實力業已大爲减低，若無去年之大陸攻勢，則其活躍力量必將更低於今日，日軍茲巳確知成都爲其轟炸機基地，芝江，梁山，老河口，爲其戰鬥機基地，故已準備於最短期內，予以澈底之覆滅。駐渝軍力除空軍外，地上部隊外問雖多傳說，然實際情形當無由確悉。去年日軍進攻桂林時，曾傳有敵美地上部隊協力作戰，然日軍始終未與遭遇，故據某軍事家之觀測，敵即有地上部隊派駐渝軍，實力上不過二三師團而已，而是否全屬美籍軍士，抑有我國籍士兵參雜其中，尚屬疑間，而目下渝方號稱置秀之雲南遠征軍，則確已全部美國化矣。</p>
<h3>陳代主席　蒞蘇州視察　垂詢各地民生情形</h3>
<p>蘇州二十五日中央社電　國府陳代主席於一十四日上午十一時乘專車階同宣傳部長趙叔雍，陸軍部長葉逢，社會福利部長丁默邨等一行涖蘇視察。當經任省長親赴車站恭迎，臨省長官邸休息，由任省長報告履任以後政務推履情形，以及最近實物征收朁各地治安狀況，蘇省敎育改善辦法。陳代主席垂聆之下，異常欣慰，後示中央必以全力協助，以謀蘇省政務之改進，並再三垂詢各地民生情形，以及物價抑平辦法。最表接見第二師師長任祖萱，緩署參謀長黃其興，省政務廳徐廳長，財政廳裴廳長，敎育廳袁廳長，警務處宗處長，地方銀行任經理等，皆有懇談，對於蘇省稅收之進入正軌，官吏之掃隊貪污各節，諄諄慰勉。葉·了·趙三部長，亦分別發表意見。午後任省長隨同陳代主席及各部長巡視觀前一帶。陳代主席對蘇省官民商學各界以及軍警公務員皆能振刷精神，頗深嘉許。下午五時後，仍乘專車離蘇，以各機關皆在辦公時間，任省長遵照陳代主席意旨，通知各機關長官毋庸恭送，僅由任省長及地方銀行經理任西萍在車站恭送，陳主席臨行時囑任省長轉達各有關機關，以時間侷促，不及約談爲歉。</p>

<h3>德蘇雙方增援　繼續海戰中　德境蘇軍進展已滯緩</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫之大戰中，蘇軍步兵師，在上西里西亞與東普魯士已移近其前進之坦克車部隊，前波蘭境內之戰事，仍集中於兩分立之戰區，雙方均繼續調遺生力軍增援。至以德方而諭，地方駐軍與新成立之人民襲擊隊，源源開赴前綫，德軍避離作戰，稽遲敵軍之進展，德軍坦克車隊常突然淮攻蘇軍之側面，以圖爭取時間，而使德軍對策之進行。維斯社拉以南之蘇軍，沿斯洛伐克北部之邊界，業已抵達瑪科，但在該處已遭德軍所阻，在維斯杜拉河北岸進展之蘇軍左翼，尙未抵達德國工業區邊緣之外，再向北蘇軍前鋒已突破至奧得河，其威脅之方向在科塞爾勃里格之綫，其中心則在俄伯痕。蘇大軍同時更進逼格萊，維茲，在該地發生繳烈之戰事，自羅茲向布累斯勞前進之蘇軍，已抵達加力士，許拉茲區，但在布累斯勞以東遭德軍反攻擊退。維斯杜拉以南西進少蘇軍，在加力士以北與德軍發生激戰，該軍一部移師西北方，尚未越過托倫格尼森之綫，加力士波森與布朗堡運河間之激戰現正在進行中。蘇軍在東普魯士經吉爾根堡與阿稜斯坦之進攻，已被阻於莫隆根，東普魯士西南部所受之威脅，尚未至危急之程度，蘇軍已被阻於東普魯士湖區之南邊。德國邊界警衛軍避離蘇軍正面之進攻，巳撤至瑪蘇里亞湖東岸，莫斯德堡附近之陣綫被突入後，在北路之德軍亦已撤退，追踪之蘇軍於抵達台姆与普里加爾區後，始被遏止。德軍在東普魯士區雖受領土之損失，但其抵抗力已有相雷之增强，蘇軍在柯蘭之進攻，仍以利巴福恩堡與杜勃倫爲中心，結果又遭失敗。</p>
<p>德國民突擊隊調東部第一綫</p>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　德軍司令部於蘇軍開始冬季攻勢之際，即將多數之國民突擊隊調赴第一綫。據二十四日德軍事記者報稱：德精强之生力軍增援隊，目下已到達蘇軍威脅下之地區，一方德軍之攻擊預備隊尙未參加戰爭。</p>
<h3>些耳德河口　艦艇隊激戰</h3>

<h3>保甲人員積極協力</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>昨天本市保甲人員歡迎周市長羅秘書長等茶會席上，本人被推致詞，茲特移載於次。</p>
<p>今天保甲人員歡迎周市長羅秘書長以及各位長官，本人以保甲人員一份子的地位，略質芻言，以供當局與我全體保甲同仁參考：</p>
<p>（一）疏散人口問題，戰時都市必須疏散人口，我們已數次論列。尤其在決戰階段，在重要基地的上海，早應着手疏散人口。目前敵人利用空襲戰略，企圖牽制並擾亂我後方人心，更須適應情勢，積極實施疏散，一方面政府當局主持領導，一方面民間團體共同協力，尤其是保甲全體動員，則進行定可順利。疏散的對象，第一步先就各慈善團體，如安老，養老，殘廢，育嬰慈幼，盲啞聲啞學校等等，絕對不需要留在上海，這些團體遜人內地時，即可利用內地的祠堂，廟宇，寺院等房屋，佈置安頓。第二步就一部分女子學校，小學校等遷移，校舍也可以利用上述原有空屋，或與原有學校合併擴充。第三步就自願歸鄉者，如內地原有資達，原有房屋田地者，協助回鄉。</p>
<p>最近上海市民福利協會準備與各同鄕會商討疏散辦法。同時，分請政府機關，如警察局，保甲處，社會福利局，保安處，及水陸運輸機關，共同組織强有力的疏散委員會。疏散路徑，盡量開闢內河水運，譬如專備小輸船兩艘，帆船快船數十艘，分早晚兩班，載運疏散人口，這些船隻，只從上海載客單程運往內地，回程絕對不准搭客，而以空船載運木柴或當地過量產物來滬，專作軍警配給之用，以酬沿途軍警保護之勞。凡疏散歸鄕旅客，准許携帶相當多量行李，並减免出入口檢查麻煩，沿途並由軍警保護，旅費酌量免減，同時對於貧苦者酌予資助旅費。並對疏散人口之戶口報出手續，尤須簡單迅速。至於陸上輸送，則鐵路管理應即激底改善，並備若干專用列車，全供疏散之用，不搭普通旅容，其携帶行李及檢查手續，均照永運辦法予以便利。疏散委員會經費，市府最近原擬發行庫券，其中本有二萬萬元撥給冬賑，即就其中提出一萬萬元，辦理疏散事宜。</p>
<p>（二）充分利用保甲優點。保甲制度中的人口調查，比較最爲周密。戶口配給，即應充分利用保甲調查。過去物品配給處並未利用保甲機構，譬如分發戶口配給票，可由各區聯保處轉發，可收切實迅速之效，而物配處則另設機構分發戶口配給票，領取時間極短，領取地點內少，辦法又極煩瑣，使領票者費時費力，感覺種種困難，因此很多人因礙於職務與時問，不得已而放棄權利，這是引起配給處一部分人的作弊野心，也就是作弊的淵源。剛才周市　說，今後配給將利用保甲辦理，這與我們的主張正復相同，希望最近即可實現。</p>
<p>最後，回想上海保甲制度開始確立之時，未曾料到今日的成就。因此，對於創始者以及努力推行者表示欽佩。也就是周市長所說保甲幹部努力的結果。這裏，我想到一位身體力行的前輩張一鵬先生，當先生未出任司法行政部長以前，担任住區的甲長，每逢封鎖戒嚴，職務上應行出動之際，他必親自到塲執行任務，從不偷懶或委人替代。這是民間自發努力保甲服務的模範人物。希望今後進一步發揚民間自發努力的精神，同時，當局尤其軍警方面，對於保甲運用不太機械化，除着眼於軍事治安協助以外，並須注意政治訓練與培養工作，充分給予自發努力的機會。</p>
<p>以上所說，雖爲歷來一貫主張，今天借此機會，特別重複地强調申說，以期從速實現與進步。</p>
<h3>首都抑平物價　當局召開會議　盟邦憲兵隊積極協力</h3>
<p>南京廿五日中央社電　邇來一般物價直綫上昇，猛漲不止，影響於民生問題，至深且鉅，即就南京市區而言，京城內外物價亦極懸殊。國府當局有鑒於此，爲澈底維持首都市區內一般民生之安定起見，業於日前由關係方面，如開首都市區生活必需物資平價維紀懇談會議，出席陸軍部部長葉蓬，南京特別市市長周學昌，首都警察總監李謳一，中央憲兵司令陳皋等，於本月十三·十五·十七·十九·廿二等日，分別連續舉行五次會議，幷已擬定首都市區生活必需物資平價維紀方案草案，聞業於廿三日經陳代主席批示核准，決定成立「首都物資平價維紀委員會」主仟委員已決定爲陸軍部部長葉逢，委員爲周學昌，李謳一，陳皋，姜佐宣，袁愈佺，劉啓雄，鍾健魂，李昌，陳寳亮等十人，聞將定於本月廿九日舉行第一次全體委員會議後，該項方案，即將公佈實施。</p>
<p>盟邦協力</p>
<p>關於抑平本市物價，我當局已下最大決心，特組織「首都物資平價維紀委員會」主持其事，務使於舊歲年底見諸實施。茲本京盟邦憲兵隊當局，亦決定絕對協力，自本月二十五日起，將出動所部，協助取締囤積投機分子。此次協力範圍不問中日商人，有關統制商品，均包括在內。尤其米糧之由中華門搬入城內，業經有關當局准予自由搬入，日本憲兵將儘量協助，掃除一切沿途勒索等非法情事，以安正當商人農民，不問任何人等，如有違反當局所決定之方針者，將予嚴厲的軍律處置。又向爲正當行旅所苦之鐵道一部不正當職員之非法需索及偷貨，亦將斷然處分，務使正當商人得到保障，投機分子斂跡，而使物價底於安定。</p>

<h3>全市保甲人員歡迎　新任市府長官　周市長羅秘書長蒞臨致訓</h3>
<p>本市各區保甲委員會　總聯保長及全市保甲幹部人員，爲表示擁護周兼市長羅秘書長等新任市政長官起見，特於昨日下午五時，假國際飯店舉行歡迎茶會，到本市各局處長官　劍東·渡正監·許江·劉德煊·戴英夫·徐季敦·劉星辰·李時雨·滿其蔚·五島茂·平岡勇等·以及保甲處长　繼武，暨各區保甲委員林康俠·陳彬　·吳　齋·沈嗣良·馮炳南等不下三百餘人，周市長偕同羅秘書長在自警樂隊　樂聲中蒞臨會塲，全體起立致敬，行禮如儀後，首由顧處長致詞，繼由保甲委員代表林康侯·吳蘊　獻詞，旋恭請周兼市長羅秘書長致訓詞，最後由保甲宣傳委員會主任委員陳彬龢致詞（詞見今日本報社評　），全塲空氣極爲熱烈融治，茶會直至六時許始散。詳情如次：</p>
<p>顧處長詞</p>
<p>「市長·秘書長·各位先生，諸位保甲工作同仁，自從周市長羅秘書長蒞任以來，到今天開茶會，爲時不過旬日，整個上海市的氣象，却已煥然一新。我們保甲同仁，對新市政當局，爲表示歡迎與敬意，今天舉行茶會招待。今天茶會的主人，是市區各保甲委員會主任委員，常務委員，暨正副各總聯保長，也是本市區保甲民間代表，雖未食官錄。然均受政府之聘任或委任，實際亦具有同僚的關係，今日歡叙一堂，不禁有大家團聚之感。又有保甲模範自警團員，也自我策動，環衛左右，此項模範自警團，乃選拔各區有智識之靑年，加以嚴格訓練，成爲一種民間力量的集團，此次參加警衛，尤足爲我保甲同仁擁護長官之特色，本人亦趁此歡迎盛會之中，敬謹表示愉快之熱情，恭祝周市長羅秘長暨各位長官康健。」</p>
<p>林康侯詞</p>
<p>由保甲委員林康侯·吳　寗等，相繼致詞：林康侯致詞云：「今天我們保甲工作人員，爲表示　　愛戴新市政長官，在此舉行茶會，承蒙光臨，賣深歡幸。本市區爲各級保甲　溝通聲氣起見，設立保甲委員會，各保甲區設區委員會，爲各級保甲層之諮詢及聯絡機關，一方面傳遞並執行官方政策，一方面貢獻或檢討民衆之要求，我上海保甲，　數年來不斷之改進，制度漸見統一，工作日見革新，當此周市長，羅秘書長勵精圖治之際，我保甲同仁，自當努力追隨，堅毅勇敢，爲國家社會服務，有一分精力，盡一分貢獻，本周市長「公利重於私利，社會先於個人」之皆，埋頭苦幹，持之以恒，加强警民合作之陣綫，協力維持地方治安，官民融洽，促進政治淸明，敬祝周市長，羅秘書長，及各位長官健康，諸位同仁一致努力。</p>
<p>吳蘊齋詞</p>
<p>吳蘊齋致詞略稱：「今天本市十八個保甲區分會，及總聯保歉迎周市長羅秘書長，鄙人亦爲保甲區一份子，所以承大家推鄙人說幾句話。今天承一位長官政務倥惚之時，　然蒞臨，吾們覺得這是一件榮幸的事。周市長羅秘書長從政多年，政績昭著，這一次到上海來抱着偉大的精神，堅決的意志，在前天五團體歡迎會上，周市長宣示「公利重於私利，社會先於個人，」羅秘書長宣示，「不講情面，正直無私」中，我們可以見到，所以我們市民表示十分敬仰與熱烈的期待。上海的社會情形，非常複雜，過去陳市長曾費了一番心血，這次再得兩位賢明長官出任艱鉅，上海市民何幸得此。保甲原爲我國古時所有的制度，是人民本身自衛的團體，他的特點就是協助政府，維特社會秩序，並且對於社會上好的份子，加以扶助，對於不良的份子，加以剷除。近三年來，本市保甲制度經各方人員的工作努力，尚有相當成績，以後還應當繼續努力，以期達到兩位長官，爲市民謀安居樂業偉大的使命，進是鄙人所深切希望的。</p>
<p>周市長詞</p>
<p>旋恭請周市長致訓詞，略謂：「今天承蒙盛大茶會招待，與各位先生見面，深感愉快。上海保甲經諸位幾年來之努力，成績很好，制度很完備，本人對此深爲欣慰。保甲在中國自古已有，民國以來亦幾經推行，民國二十一年團府展開剿匪工作，在豫鄂皖三省，除軍事工作外，復組織保甲以協助政治，當時羅秘書長正在總司令部服務。迨至事變前二年，保甲制度始逐漸普遍，當時一般人以爲上海絕不能成立保甲，因爲人口太多，移動頻繁，且爲通商大埠，夢想不到在事變後經各位努力，上海竟然成立比較完備之保甲制度，故益信事在人爲，祗要努力，萬事可成，本人對各位之努力極表欽佩。保甲制度爲民衆組織，爲人民與政府間之連繫，旣可推行法令，又可傳達民意，好的人組織起來，壞的予以剷除，但絕不能濫用權力，使人民加重一層壓迫，此種情形，鄕間頗多，深信上海不會有此現象，更望能預防此種弊端。其次保甲組織應推行政令，以協助政府，上海保甲人員，應木此努力。同時今後市府於配給物品時，希望保甲協助，使能公正普遍，今後務望諸君能保持過去的優點，使保甲制度順利推行」。</p>
<p>羅秘書長訓詞</p>
<p>本人追隨周市長到上海後，今天承本市區保甲工作同志，茶會招待，實深愉快。上海保甲工作成績之表現，在社會上已有相當成績，並未辜負諸位過去辛勤的努力，近來上　治安進展之快速，足　保甲組織廣收宏效的佐證。目前上海自　團負防空團員等之加緊訓練保甲幹部人員之愼重選擇，保甲行政之口漸健全，本人對此保甲工作的陣容，實寄予莫大之期望，自警團成立以來，守望相助，消弭了盜風，制止了不法行動，這實在是很好的。最近防空演習，自警團和保甲人員担任了中心工作，這不能不說不是保甲系統，協助軍警方面的貢獻。計口授糧的配給制度，是以保甲戶口爲推行根據，自警團員，有監督檢舉社會一切罪行之責，因此凡關車站倫埠交通秩序之維持，紅黑帽子紀律之整頓，配給物品長蛇陣苦痛的解除，囤戶奸商的舉發，一切不良份子活動，均有待於保甲自警之協力，由市政當局，分別予以嚴厲的制裁，庶不負市民安定生活的期望。</p>

<h3>本市捐稅　擬重行估價</h3>

<h3>Repeated Attacks by Japanese Air Force: Enemy Airfields on Leyte and Mindoro Islands; Enemy Convoy off Mindoro Sea also Heavily Bombed</h3>
<p>Philippine Front, Japanese Army Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Air Force is currently fighting fiercely on Leyte Island, echoing the brave battles of the Japanese soldiers. From January 1st to the 22nd, they have repeatedly attacked enemy airfields on Leyte and Mindoro Islands, setting fire to 21 locations at Tacloban Airfield, one location at Talak Airfield, three locations at Tanoman Airfield, and four locations at the North San Jose Airfield.</p>
<p>From a Japanese Base in the Philippines, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the evening of the 24th, the Japanese Air Force fiercely attacked a transport convoy sailing in the Mindoro Sea, inflicting considerable losses.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base in the Philippines, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since the enemy landed in Lingayen Gulf, the state of enemy aircraft raids on Luzon Island has been as follows: On the first day, there were a total of 300 to 400 aircraft. Subsequently, the types of aircraft gradually became mixed, and the numbers also gradually increased. The main enemy aircraft included the large B24, the medium P38, and the small P47. Other medium aircraft included the B25A and (maybe B26A), and small aircraft included the P51 and P40. Simultaneously, carrier-based aircraft also participated. Their composition varied daily. On the 23rd, there were a total of 263 aircraft, including five large aircraft, 170 medium aircraft, and 88 small aircraft. On the 24th, there were a total of 405 aircraft, including 122 large aircraft, 224 medium aircraft, and 59 small aircraft. The bases for these enemy aircraft are the airfields on Morotai, Leyte, and Mindoro. Departure times are approximately 2:30 AM to 4:00 AM for Morotai, 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM for Leyte, and 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM for Mindoro. Raids occur once in the morning, with formations of about 20 aircraft or so, attacking in detachments. However, when approaching mobile units, carrier-based aircraft carry out attacks to cut off Japanese transportation routes and hinder the construction of Japanese positions. They also engage in guerrilla warfare with a few aircraft, even invading in the afternoon. The main force of enemy aircraft is cooperating with the land battles in the Lingayen area, using shorter-range fighters. Recently, they have started using airfields landed in Lingayen Bay as bases, engaging actively.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Fighting Valiantly on Luzon Island</p>
<p>Philippine Front Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Enemy forces in the southeast coastal area of Lingayen Gulf have suffered heavy losses from brave Japanese attacks. However, superior enemy forces repeatedly attacked Japanese positions around Rosario with powerful mobile units on the 22nd, firing over 6,000 shells daily since then. Conversely, Japanese troops fought bravely, charging into enemy lines, completely foiling enemy attack attempts. On the 21st and 22nd, Japanese troops killed or wounded over 400 enemy soldiers in the area, destroyed over 34 enemy tanks, and shattered or captured many other artillery pieces. On the 21st, the enemy landed a portion of their forces near Santo Barbara. Enemy forces on the front line of San Fabian also shelled the Japanese first-line positions. A portion of the enemy eventually seized a corner of the Japanese first-line position. Japanese troops are still bravely counterattacking. Enemy flanking units at Villasis encircled a portion of the Japanese positions in the southern Villasis area. These Japanese troops are also fighting fiercely.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The battle situation on Luzon Island is as follows: The battle situation on the high ground east of the Pangasinan Plain remains largely unchanged. Japanese troops north of Mabiga are currently adopting a defensive posture. Furthermore, enemy forces that bypassed the first-line positions and infiltrated deep into Solibao have gradually become passive due to four weeks of fierce Japanese attacks. The enemy strength in this area includes approximately three divisions of the First Army Corps of engineers. The main force of the enemy landing force includes one division of the Fourteenth Army Corps, which is moving south from the Lingayen-Dagupan area. Around the 15th, they reached the Agno River basin, and one unit crossed the river southward. Around the 20th, they appear to have entered the central Luzon Plain, reaching Tarlac and La Paz, about ten kilometers east of it. Within the northwestern tip of Lingayen Gulf, near Bolinao and Alaminos to the southeast, approximately twenty kilometers northwest of Lingayen, a portion of the enemy troops appear to have landed. As for the total enemy strength on Luzon Island, it includes five strong divisions: the 6th, 25th, 4th, and 13th Divisions of the First Army, along with the 158th Regiment, and the 27th and 40th Divisions of the Fourteenth Army Corps, along with a portion of the Marines. Enemy transport convoys are still traveling to and from Lingayen Gulf. On the 20th, there were twenty transport ships. On the 21st, there were several ships. On the 23rd, a considerable number of transport ships entered the harbor.</p>
<h3>Ba Maw's Statement: Refutes British Draft</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) – At the end of last year, the British government issued a draft regarding the handling of Burma, revealing their treacherous scheme to oppress weak nations. The Burmese people were outraged upon hearing this. On the 23rd, Burmese national representative Ba Maw met with a delegation of Japanese, Burmese, and Indian news reporters, strongly refuting the draft and issuing the following statement: After the British draft was released, the Burmese people became extremely angry. Monks and youths alike unanimously requested the government to participate in the war to defend the homeland. Now, in response to the people's wishes, the government is exerting all its strength to cooperate in the war and is adopting wartime emergency measures. Therefore, youth organizations will soon implement a conscription system, and labor organizations will also conduct labor registration. The national will to fight is completely contrary to what the British are propagating, and is even more intense than during the expulsion of British forces in 1942. As for the plan in the draft to place Burma under military control for a period of time, the so-called "reconstruction of Burma" is entirely a British ploy to suppress the Burmese people. The constitution being formulated is merely a means of deceiving the Burmese people. Burma will never be deceived by British rhetoric. Although Britain claims that the Japanese military's presence in Burma is the sole target of their attacks, the Japanese military's true goal is to defend Burmese territory. The British are engaging in actual invasion plans, fabricating various pretexts. According to a monk who escaped from British-occupied territory in northern Burma, there is no respect for human rights or international law in British-occupied areas. This kind of politics is purely exploitative. Therefore, the British political policy is evident.</p>

<p>Army Minister Reports on Soldiers' Valiant Fighting</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – During the general budget committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 24th, Mr. Akira Koyama questioned the current situation of the Japanese soldiers fighting actively on the islands behind enemy lines. Army Minister Sugiyama replied as follows: Although 30-40% of the army soldiers on the South Pacific islands have died, they have not been defeated and are not wavering. In particular, since the Guadalcanal operation, the Japanese units fighting in various parts of the South Pacific have continued to fight bravely on isolated islands. They are determined to serve the country to the last man. In the recent Battle of Peleliu, despite being subjected to superior enemy air attacks, the Japanese army continued to fight bravely. This is the spirit of the Japanese soldiers. All members have a special attack spirit and are determined to repay the country with unwavering combat to the last man.</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture Declares to Secure Rice Rations</p>

<h3>Air Battle Over Palembang Area, Sumatra; Over 78 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 25th: On the morning of January 24th, approximately 120 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Palembang area of Sumatra. The local Japanese air force and ground forces intercepted them, shooting down over 78 enemy aircraft. Fourteen Japanese aircraft did not return. Damage to ground facilities was minor.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Japanese Military Results in the Irrawaddy River Basin</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese forces in Burma have been bravely fighting the strong Chinese-American forces for days. From December 1st to January 15th, the main comprehensive battle results in the Irrawaddy River basin are roughly as follows: 1,404 dead Chinese-American soldiers left behind, 1,509 captured, 6,940 wounded or killed, 12 tanks lost, and 91 vehicles lost. In addition, the Japanese army captured many artillery pieces and firearms.</p>
<h3>Chinese-American Air Force Bases to be Thoroughly Destroyed</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Chinese-American Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently been carrying out indiscriminate and aimless bombing of peaceful areas, causing deep resentment and hatred among the people, who are becoming more determined to fight the enemy. According to their propaganda, the bombing targets of the Chinese-American Air Force are mainly so-called military facilities. However, their actions violate what they proclaim. They disregard Chinese civilians, carry out indiscriminate bombings, and show no selectivity. Since the Japanese army launched its continental operations last year, most of their air bases have been lost. In addition, their recent defeats in the Pacific have exacerbated their indiscriminate bombing. The American military is trying to use the results of blindly bombing our compatriots to conceal the fact of their defeat. Their intentions are very clear. However, most of their air bases in Chongqing have been lost, and their strength has been greatly reduced. If there had been no continental offensive last year, their active strength would be even lower today. The Japanese army now knows for sure that Chengdu is their bomber base and that Zhijiang, Liangshan, and Laohekou are their fighter bases. Therefore, preparations have been made to thoroughly destroy them in the shortest possible time. Apart from the air force, there are many rumors about ground forces stationed in Chongqing. However, the actual situation cannot be known for sure. When the Japanese army attacked Guilin last year, it was rumored that enemy American ground forces were cooperating in the fighting, but the Japanese army never encountered them. Therefore, according to the observation of a certain military expert, even if the enemy has ground forces stationed in Chongqing, their strength is only about two or three divisions. It is still doubtful whether they are all American soldiers or whether Chinese soldiers are mixed in. However, the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, which Chongqing currently claims to have stationed in Yunnan, is indeed completely Americanized.</p>

After 5:00 PM, they left Suzhou by special train. As the various agencies were still in office hours, Governor Ren, in accordance with Acting Chairman Chen's wishes, notified the heads of the various agencies not to come to see them off, and only Governor Ren and the manager of the local bank, Ren Xiping, saw them off at the station. Before leaving, Chairman Chen instructed Governor Ren to convey his apologies to the relevant agencies for not being able to talk to them due to the limited time.</p>

<h3>Both Germany and the Soviet Union Send Reinforcements; Continuing Naval Battles; Soviet Progress in Germany Has Stalled</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Reuter reports: In the major battles on the Eastern Front, Soviet infantry divisions in Upper Silesia and East Prussia have approached their advancing tank units. The fighting within former Polish territory remains concentrated in two separate war zones, and both sides continue to send fresh troops as reinforcements. As for the German side, local garrison forces and newly formed people's assault teams are continuously heading to the front lines. The German army avoids direct combat, delaying the enemy's progress. German tank units often suddenly attack the flanks of the Soviet army in an attempt to buy time for the German army to implement countermeasures. The Soviet army south of the Vistula River has reached Makov along the northern border of Slovakia, but has been stopped there by the German army. The Soviet left flank advancing on the north bank of the Vistula River has not yet reached the edge of the German industrial area. Further north, the Soviet vanguard has broken through to the Oder River, with its threatened direction on the Kosel-Brieg line and its center in Ober-Glogau. At the same time, the Soviet army is pressing closer to Gleiwitz and Hindenburg, where fierce fighting is taking place. The Soviet army advancing towards Breslau from Łódź has reached the Kalisz and Oels areas, but has been pushed back by a German counterattack east of Breslau. The Soviet army advancing west south of the Vistula River is engaged in fierce fighting with the German army north of Kalisz. A portion of this army has moved to the northwest but has not yet crossed the Torun-Gniesen line. Fierce fighting is currently taking place between the Kalisz-Poznan and Bromberg Canals. In East Prussia, the Soviet offensives via Gielgenburg and Allenstein have been stopped at Morungen. The threat to southwestern East Prussia has not yet reached a critical level, and the Soviet army has been stopped south of the East Prussian Lake District. The German border guard forces have withdrawn from the Soviet army's frontal offensive and have retreated to the east bank of the Masurian Lakes. After the lines near Lötzen and Goldap were penetrated, the German army in the north also retreated. The pursuing Soviet army was stopped only after reaching the Stallupönen and Pregel areas. Although the German army in the East Prussian area has suffered territorial losses, its resistance has increased relatively. The Soviet offensive in the Courland Pocket, with Libau and Frauenburg as its center, has once again failed.</p>
<p>German People's Assault Troops Deployed to Eastern Front First Line</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – When the Soviet army began its winter offensive, the German army headquarters immediately deployed a majority of the People's Assault Troops to the first line. According to a German military reporter on the 24th, reinforcements of strong German fresh troops have now arrived in the areas threatened by the Soviet army. However, the German army's attack reserve teams have not yet joined the war.</p>
<h3>Naval Battle at the Scheldt Estuary</h3>

<h3>Active Cooperation of Baojia Personnel</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the tea party held by the Baojia personnel of this city to welcome Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, I was asked to deliver a speech. I am now transcribing it as follows:</p>
<p>Today, as Baojia personnel welcome Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and all the officials, I, as a member of the Baojia, would like to offer some humble suggestions for the reference of the authorities and all my Baojia colleagues:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of population evacuation: cities in wartime must evacuate the population. We have discussed this numerous times. Especially in the decisive phase, Shanghai, as an important base, should have started evacuating the population long ago. Currently, the enemy is using air raid tactics to try to contain and disrupt the morale of our rear areas. We must adapt to the situation and actively implement evacuation. On the one hand, the government authorities should lead and direct; on the other hand, civil society groups should cooperate. In particular, the entire Baojia should be mobilized to ensure smooth progress. The targets of evacuation should be, first, various charitable organizations, such as those for the elderly, the disabled, orphans, infant care, and schools for the blind and deaf-mute. They absolutely do not need to stay in Shanghai. When these groups move to the interior, they can use ancestral halls, temples, and monasteries in the interior to arrange accommodation. The second step is to relocate some girls' schools, primary schools, etc. School buildings can also use the aforementioned vacant houses or merge and expand with existing schools. The third step is to assist those who voluntarily return to their hometowns, such as those who have assets and houses and land in the interior, to return home.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association is preparing to discuss evacuation methods with various hometown associations. At the same time, it will ask government agencies, such as the police bureau, Baojia office, social welfare bureau, security office, and water and land transportation agencies, to jointly organize a strong evacuation committee. For evacuation routes, inland waterway transport should be developed as much as possible. For example, prepare two small transport ships and dozens of sailing junks and fast boats, divided into morning and evening shifts, to transport evacuated people. These ships will only carry passengers one way from Shanghai to the interior and will absolutely not be allowed to carry passengers on the return trip. Instead, they will carry firewood or surplus local products to Shanghai to be used exclusively for military and police rations to compensate the military and police along the way for their protection. All evacuated travelers returning to their hometowns will be allowed to carry a considerable amount of luggage, and import and export inspection procedures will be reduced and exempted. They will also be protected by the military and police along the way. Travel expenses will be reduced or exempted as appropriate, and those in poverty will be given subsidies for travel expenses. The household registration procedures for the evacuated population must be simple and quick. As for land transportation, railway management should be thoroughly improved immediately, and several dedicated trains should be prepared, exclusively for evacuation use, without carrying ordinary passengers. The procedures for carrying luggage and inspection will be facilitated in accordance with permanent transportation regulations. The municipal government originally planned to issue treasury bonds for the evacuation committee's expenses, of which 20 million yuan was allocated for winter relief. One hundred million yuan will be taken from this to handle evacuation matters.</p>
<p>(2) Fully utilize the advantages of the Baojia. The population survey in the Baojia system is relatively thorough. Household distribution should fully utilize the Baojia survey. In the past, the goods distribution office did not utilize the Baojia organization. For example, the distribution of household allocation tickets could be distributed by the joint Baojia offices in each district, which would be effective and quick. However, the goods distribution office set up a separate organization to distribute household allocation tickets. The collection time was extremely short, the collection points were few, and the procedures were extremely cumbersome, causing those who received the tickets to waste time and effort and feel all sorts of difficulties. Therefore, many people were forced to give up their rights due to their duties and time constraints. This aroused the fraudulent ambitions of some people in the distribution office, which is the source of fraud. Mayor Zhou just said that future distribution will be handled using the Baojia, which is exactly the same as our proposal. We hope that this can be realized soon.</p>
<p>Finally, looking back at the beginning of the establishment of the Shanghai Baojia system, we never expected today's achievements. Therefore, we express our admiration for the founders and those who have worked hard to promote it. This is also the result of the hard work of the Baojia cadres, as Mayor Zhou said. Here, I think of a senior who practiced what he preached, Mr. Zhang Yipeng. Before Mr. Zhang took office as the Minister of Judicial Administration, he served as the Jia leader in the residential area. Whenever there was a blockade or curfew, he would personally go to the scene to perform his duties and never be lazy or delegate to others. This is a model figure for civilian self-initiated efforts in Baojia service. We hope that in the future, we will further promote the spirit of civilian self-initiated efforts. At the same time, the authorities, especially the military and police, should not use the Baojia too mechanically. In addition to focusing on military and security assistance, they must also pay attention to political training and cultivation work and fully give opportunities for self-initiated efforts.</p>
<p>The above, although a consistent advocacy, I would like to take this opportunity today to emphasize and repeat it in order to achieve rapid realization and progress.</p>
<h3>Capital Suppresses and Stabilizes Prices; Authorities Convene Meetings; Allied Gendarmerie Actively Cooperates</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency): Recently, commodity prices have risen in a straight line, soaring continuously, which has a profound and significant impact on people's livelihood. Even within the Nanjing city area, the prices inside and outside the capital are extremely disparate. In view of this, the national government authorities, in order to thoroughly maintain the stability of the general people's livelihood in the capital city area, held a meeting of relevant parties, such as the inaugural Capital City Area Essential Living Materials Price Stabilization Conference. Those in attendance were Army Minister Ye Peng, Nanjing Special City Mayor Zhou Xuechang, Capital Police Chief Li Ouyi, Central Gendarmerie Commander Chen Gao, and others. Five consecutive meetings were held separately on the 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, and 22nd of this month, and a draft plan for the Capital City Area Essential Living Materials Price Stabilization Plan has been formulated. It is reported that it was approved by Acting Chairman Chen on the 23rd, and it was decided to establish the "Capital Materials Price Stabilization Committee." The chief committee member has been determined to be Army Minister Ye Feng, and the members are Zhou Xuechang, Li Ouyi, Chen Gao, Jiang Zuoxuan, Yuan Yuyuan, Liu Qixiong, Zhong Jianhun, Li Chang, Chen Baoliang, and ten others. It is reported that the first plenary committee meeting will be held on the 29th of this month, and the plan will be announced and implemented immediately thereafter.</p>
<p>Allied Cooperation</p>
<p>Regarding suppressing and stabilizing commodity prices in this city, our authorities have made the greatest determination and have specially organized the "Capital Materials Price Stabilization Committee" to preside over the matter, so as to see its implementation by the end of the old year. The Allied gendarmerie authorities in this capital have also decided to provide absolute cooperation. Starting from the 25th of this month, they will dispatch their troops to assist in cracking down on hoarders and speculators. The scope of this cooperation does not distinguish between Chinese and Japanese merchants, and all controlled commodities are included. In particular, the relevant authorities have approved the free entry of rice and grain from Zhonghua Gate into the city. The Japanese gendarmerie will provide as much assistance as possible to eliminate all illegal activities such as extortion along the way, so as to reassure legitimate merchants and farmers. Anyone who violates the policies determined by the authorities will be subject to severe military law. In addition, the illegal demands and theft of goods by some unscrupulous railway officials, which have always plagued legitimate travelers, will also be resolutely dealt with, so as to ensure that legitimate merchants are protected, speculators are deterred, and commodity prices are stabilized.</p>

<h3>Citywide Baojia Personnel Welcome Newly Appointed Municipal Government Officials; Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo Arrive to Deliver Instructions</h3>
<p>The Baojia Committees of all districts in this city, the chief liaison officers of all Baojia, and all Baojia cadres in the city, in order to express their support for Mayor Zhou (concurrently) and Secretary-General Luo and other newly appointed municipal government officials, held a welcome tea party at the International Hotel at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. The heads of various bureaus and offices of the city, including Jiandong, Watanabe, Xu Jiang, Liu Dexuan, Dai Yingfu, Xu Jidun, Liu Xingchen, Li Shiyu, Man Qiwei, Gotoshima Shigeru, Hiraoka Isamu, and others, as well as Baojia Office Director Ji Wu, and Baojia committee members from various districts Lin Kangxia, Chen Binhe, Wu Yunzhai, Shen Siliang, Feng Bingnan, and others, numbering no less than 300, attended. Mayor Zhou, accompanied by Secretary-General Luo, arrived at the venue to the sound of the Self-Police Band. Everyone stood up to pay their respects. After the ceremonial proceedings, Director Gu delivered a speech, followed by Baojia committee representatives Lin Kanghou and Wu Yunzhai delivering speeches. Then, Mayor Zhou (concurrently) and Secretary-General Luo were respectfully invited to deliver instructions. Finally, Chen Binhe, director of the Baojia Propaganda Committee, delivered a speech (the speech can be found in today's newspaper editorial). The atmosphere was extremely warm and harmonious. The tea party did not end until around 6:00 p.m. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Director Gu's Speech</p>
<p>"Mayor, Secretary-General, distinguished guests, and fellow Baojia workers, it has only been a few days since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, but the entire atmosphere of Shanghai has been completely renewed. Our Baojia colleagues are holding a tea party today to express our welcome and respect to the new municipal government. The hosts of today's tea party are the directors and standing committee members of the Baojia committees in each district, as well as the heads of all the liaison offices. They are also the representatives of the people in the Baojia of this city. Although they do not receive official salaries, they are appointed or commissioned by the government and are in fact colleagues. I feel a sense of unity when we gather here today. There are also exemplary Self-Police Corps members who have taken the initiative to guard the surroundings. This exemplary Self-Police Corps is a group of knowledgeable young people selected from each district and rigorously trained to become a group of civilian forces. Their participation in the security today is a unique feature of our Baojia colleagues' support for the officials. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my joyful enthusiasm and wish Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and all the officials good health."</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Speech</p>
<p>Speeches were delivered successively by Baojia committee members Lin Kanghou and Wu Yunning. Lin Kanghou said in his speech: "Today, we Baojia workers are holding a tea party here to express our admiration and love for the new municipal government officials. We are deeply honored by your presence. In order to facilitate communication between the Baojia at all levels in this city, we have established the Baojia Committee. Each Baojia district has a district committee, which serves as a consultation and liaison mechanism for the Baojia at all levels. On the one hand, it transmits and implements official policies, and on the other hand, it contributes to or reviews the demands of the people. The Shanghai Baojia has been continuously improving over the past few years. The system is gradually becoming unified, and the work is becoming more innovative. At this time, when Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo are working hard to govern, our Baojia colleagues should strive to follow, be firm and brave, and serve the country and society. We should contribute as much as we can with our energy, bury ourselves in hard work, persevere, strengthen the front line of police-civilian cooperation, cooperate to maintain local security, harmonize officials and people, and promote political integrity, following Mayor Zhou's words that 'public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual'. I wish Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and all the officials good health, and I wish all my colleagues united efforts."</p>
<p>Wu Yunzhai's Speech</p>
<p>Wu Yunzhai said in his speech: "Today, the 18 Baojia district branches and the general liaison office of this city welcome Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo. I am also a member of the Baojia district, so I have been asked to say a few words. Today, we are honored that one of the officials has taken the time out of his busy schedule to come here. Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo have been in politics for many years and have achieved remarkable achievements. This time, they have come to Shanghai with a great spirit and firm will. At the welcome meeting of the five groups the day before yesterday, Mayor Zhou declared that 'public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual,' and Secretary-General Luo declared that 'no favoritism, upright and selfless.' From this, we can see that we, the citizens, express our great admiration and enthusiastic expectations. The social situation in Shanghai is very complex. Mayor Chen has spent a lot of effort in the past. This time, we are fortunate to have two wise officials take on the arduous task. What a blessing for the people of Shanghai. The Baojia was originally a system that existed in ancient China. It is a self-defense organization of the people themselves. Its characteristic is to assist the government, maintain social order, and provide assistance to good people in the community and eliminate bad people. In the past three years, the Baojia system in this city has achieved considerable results through the efforts of all parties. In the future, we should continue to work hard in order to achieve the great mission of the two officials to seek a comfortable and prosperous life for the people of the city. This is what I deeply hope for."</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Mayor Zhou was respectfully invited to deliver instructions, saying: "Today, I am very pleased to be invited to this grand tea party and to meet with all of you. The Shanghai Baojia has achieved very good results and has a very complete system thanks to your efforts over the past few years. I am very pleased with this. The Baojia has existed in China since ancient times, and it has been promoted several times since the Republic of China. In 1932, the National Government launched the suppression of bandits. In the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, in addition to military work, the Baojia was also organized to assist in politics. At that time, Secretary-General Luo was serving in the General Headquarters. Until two years before the Incident, the Baojia system gradually became widespread. At that time, people generally believed that the Baojia could never be established in Shanghai because the population was too large, the mobility was frequent, and it was a major trading port. It was unimaginable that Shanghai would establish a relatively complete Baojia system after the Incident thanks to everyone's efforts. Therefore, I believe that everything depends on people. As long as we work hard, everything can be achieved. I express my great admiration for everyone's efforts. The Baojia system is a people's organization, a link between the people and the government. It can not only promote laws and regulations but also convey public opinion. Good people are organized, and bad people are eliminated, but we must never abuse our power and add another layer of oppression to the people. This kind of situation is quite common in rural areas. I am confident that this phenomenon will not occur in Shanghai, and I hope that we can prevent this kind of malpractice. Secondly, the Baojia organization should promote government orders to assist the government. The Baojia personnel in Shanghai should work hard in this regard. At the same time, in the future, the municipal government hopes that the Baojia will assist in the distribution of goods so that it can be fair and universal. In the future, I hope that you can maintain the advantages of the past so that the Baojia system can be smoothly promoted."</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo's Instructions</p>
<p>"After following Mayor Zhou to Shanghai, I am very pleased to be invited to the tea party by the Baojia workers in this city today. The performance of the Shanghai Baojia has achieved considerable results in society and has not disappointed your past hard work. The rapid progress of public security in Shanghai recently is sufficient proof of the extensive and effective organization of the Baojia. Currently, Shanghai is stepping up the training of community defense team members and carefully selecting Baojia cadres. The Baojia administration is gradually becoming sound. I have great expectations for the lineup of Baojia workers. Since the establishment of the self-police corps, they have been helping each other and eliminating theft and preventing illegal actions. This is really good. Recently, the self-police corps and Baojia personnel took on the central work in the air defense exercise. It cannot be said that this is not a contribution of the Baojia system to assisting the military and police. The ration system based on household population is based on the Baojia household registration. Members of the self-police corps have the responsibility to supervise and report all crimes in society. Therefore, all matters related to maintaining order at stations and docks, rectifying the discipline of red and black hats, alleviating the pain of long queues for distributed goods, reporting hoarders and unscrupulous merchants, and the activities of all bad elements all depend on the cooperation of the Baojia self-police. The municipal government will impose severe sanctions separately, so as not to fail the expectations of the citizens for a stable life."</p>

<h3>Municipal Donations and Taxes to Be Revalued</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau is now actively rectifying finances. For donations and taxes in the urban area, it has decided to reform and adjust them on the principle of not increasing the burden on merchants and residents. For example, the tax rates for bamboo and wood donations and housing donations, etc., are based on valuations made a year ago, which are no longer suitable for current valuation standards. Therefore, in order to enhance tax administration and enrich municipal treasury revenue, it has been decided to revalue the valuation of various donations and taxes in accordance with current material value standards.</p>
<h3>Special Tax on Fresh Meat to Be Collected Centrally Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Livestock Industry Pork Retailers Association previously stated that members requested that it was quite inconvenient to pay the special consumption tax in a piecemeal manner. Therefore, it petitioned the financial authorities to change the tax collection to be collected centrally by the slaughterhouse in the future, and the tax amount was set at 800 yuan per pig, which will be implemented starting today.</p>
<h3>Post Office Revises International Postage</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Post Office issued a notice revising international postage rates, stating: "Pursuant to the order of the Shanghai Office of the Postal Administration General Bureau, approved by the Ministry of Construction, the international postage rates and special rates in the third category of the postage rate table will be revised from January 20 of this year. Certain postal items and special rates in the fourth and fifth categories originally calculated according to the third category will also be subject to the newly revised rates. The newly revised rates are listed below:</p>
<p>Letters: 30 yuan for the first 20 grams, 17.5 yuan for each additional 20 grams; postcards: 17.5 yuan for single, 35 yuan for double; newspapers (first class): 6.5 yuan per 50 grams; books (printed matter): 6.5 yuan per 50 grams; parcel category: 12.5 yuan per 50 grams; registration fee: 50 yuan per item; express registration fee: 115 yuan per item; priority fee: 60 yuan per item.</p>
<h3>Through Airmail to Dalian Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration recently announced that the acceptance of airmail to Dalian for the entire journey, which is carried by plane, has been temporarily suspended. However, mail to that location can still use domestic airmail to Tianjin, and then be delivered by ordinary mail route. In addition to affixing sufficient ordinary postage, domestic airmail fees should be added. For registered mail, registration fees should also be added.</p>
<h3>Laozha Branch Reiterates Orders for All Businesses to Operate on Time; Customers Violating the Law Will Be Detained for Five Days</h3>
<p>The Laozha Branch, after investigating that the entertainment venues in the district are concentrated, has strengthened strict management, especially regarding the operating hours of dancing, cafes, restaurants, and other businesses. It has long ordered that they must comply with the municipal government's regulations and restrictions and close at 10 p.m. every night. The past situation has been very good, but recently there are still some illegal merchants who dare to disregard the law, and the old habits have reappeared, superficially complying but secretly violating, operating secretly beyond the prescribed time, which is extremely illegal. After receiving a tip, the branch ordered the administrative section members to secretly investigate. In addition, it reiterated the previous order, informing all entertainment venues in writing that they must operate on time. If there is another violation, it will be severely punished according to law. As for the customers who stay, they will also be punished with five days of detention according to Article 37 of the Police Law.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Joint Operating Society Holds Establishment Meeting</h3>
<p>The China Industrial Association, in view of the current coal shortage in Shanghai, which has reached an extreme point and has had a great impact on industrial production, has mobilized the coal industry to organize the Shanghai Coal Industry Joint Operating Society in order to promote increased production and dredge coal sources. Preparations have been underway for several months, and now it is ready. The Society held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (25th) at the China Industrial Association at 285 Wuyuan Road. More than 100 members attended. Liu Weijun, representative of the Minister of Industry, Che Yiming, representative of the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, and Ma Runfang, representative of the China Baoye Association, attended and provided guidance. Chairman Shen Tinghua gave an opening speech, and Preparation Director Luo Deyou reported on the preparations. Then, Liu Weijun, the representative of the Minister of Industry, and others delivered instructions. Subsequently, after discussing the articles of association, Lin Kanghou, Shen Tinghua, Han Chengpu, and Chen Qing were elected as standing directors, Luo Deyou, Wei Zhida, Pang Runsheng, Yu Zhijing, Liu Nianzu, Chu Zhongwang, Han Buhao, Guo Yanghao, and Zhang Huimin as directors, and Liu Weijun, Gu Linshu, and Hong Jichuan as supervisors. The ceremony was completed near dusk.</p>
<h3>Interim Measures for Reorganizing Private Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Education is paying close attention to the registration and establishment of private schools at all levels. Therefore, last winter, it specially requested and received approval from the municipal government to establish a Private School Establishment and Registration Review Committee. Senior officials of the bureau were selected to be responsible for handling the matter. All private schools submitting applications for establishment or recordation by the board of directors, as well as the procedures for establishing a school, are first carefully reviewed by the committee to determine whether they comply with the revised regulations for private schools promulgated by the ministry. Then, they are submitted to the director for approval, in order to show due solemnity. Recently, a considerable number of private schools in this city have submitted applications for establishment, recordation, or registration, which are currently being processed by the bureau. However, it is reported that some schools are still unclear about the procedures for handling the above-mentioned matters, resulting in requests for corrections or supplements after review, which wastes time. It is understood that the bureau has prepared various forms for establishment, registration request forms, notices for establishment registration, and model articles of association for the board of directors, so that private schools can obtain them. In addition, it has also formulated an "Interim Measures for Reorganizing Private Primary and Secondary Schools," which specifies: (A) Schools that were already established before the Incident [likely referring to a specific historical event] and have certificates only need to register. (B) Schools that were already established before the Incident, and whose certificates are lost but have other appropriate supporting documents to prove it, also only need to register. (C) Schools that were established before the Incident but whose certificates are lost and have no appropriate supporting documents must re-establish. (D) If the board of directors has not been registered, or if the school has been established, but the school site, school property, or board of directors has undergone special changes after the Incident, establishment or registration procedures must be carried out. Furthermore, all matters handled according to the revised regulations for private schools promulgated by the ministry must be submitted by the founder's board of directors with a formal request.</p>
<h3>Hua Tie Theft: Stolen Goods Recovered from Shops</h3>
<p>The Hua Zhong Railway Company has recently reported repeated thefts of materials along its lines. Therefore, a supervisory office was specially established in Shanghai, and Li Turong, a specialist transferred from Beijing, was appointed as the director of the office to actively conduct secret investigations. It was recently discovered that Yongtai Iron Shop at No. 1221 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, and an iron shop on Bei Xi Road were privately receiving stolen goods from the company. The company immediately reported this to the police authorities, who searched the shops and found twenty bundles of stolen steel bars, one iron axle, and a considerable amount of iron plates and railway materials. Since the two shops were found to have received stolen goods, the shop owners were arrested and are currently being interrogated to determine the source of the stolen goods and to apprehend the thieves.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball A League: Zhongbei vs. Shan Team; Women's League: Three Provinces vs. Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Open Basketball League continues tonight with three games, starting at 6:00 p.m. at the Army Dormitory (West Qing) gymnasium. The first game is the women's league match between Three Provinces and Overseas Chinese. Among the ten armies of women, the Green Team is considered stronger, followed by Three Provinces and Overseas Chinese. Therefore, this game is nothing less than a battle for the runner-up. The second game is between V Team and the YMCA. The YMCA's momentum is strong, and a fierce battle is inevitable. The final game is between Zhongbei and Shan Team. The two teams previously played against each other in the Shen Bao Cup League, and the Shan Team's soldiers fought hard and overcame Zhongbei. Zhongbei has always been known as a master of the Northern school. Under the leadership of team leader Wang Zhongtao and coach Dai Changling, their ball skills are highly praised. The Shan Team's fighting spirit is superior to all teams. The outcome of the rematch is uncertain. To avoid crowding tonight, tickets are priced at 300 yuan and 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association Launches Fundraising for Winter Relief</h3>
<p>In view of the large number of extremely poor and hidden poor among the citizens of Shanghai, it is particularly necessary to provide assistance during this winter season. The association has decided to raise 50 million yuan to purchase miscellaneous grains and carry out price equalization. The municipal government has established a Winter Relief Committee, and most of the members of the association have participated in the work of the Winter Relief Committee. For example, Chen Riping, a director of the association, is the deputy director of the Winter Relief Committee. In order to save administrative expenses, it was decided to entrust the Winter Relief Committee to handle the matter. In order to expedite the process, the Central Reserve Bank was first requested to assist by lending 50 million yuan, which was immediately handed over to the Winter Relief Committee for disposal. The Winter Relief Committee has first launched three temporary relief projects (see news in previous newspapers). However, the loan is agreed to be repaid in three installments, with the first installment due on February 10th, which is approaching soon. The board of directors of the association decided to entrust Xin Shen and Shen Bao newspapers to publicly raise funds. It is hoped that wealthy and charitable people in Shanghai will generously donate money to benefit the poor. Donations can be sent directly to the social service departments of Xin Shen and Shen Bao newspapers for collection. The titles of donors will be published separately in Xin Shen and Shen Bao newspapers.</p>
<p>Readers' Scholarship News</p>
<h3>School Opening is Approaching, and Funds are Increasingly Urgent: Hoping Readers Will Continue Their Efforts</h3>
<p>The internal work of the eighth session of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund has been completed in two stages, and is generally ready. However, the "Special Fundraising" has not yet reached its target, and the school opening is imminent. Beneficiary students are sending letters and telegrams requesting that the scholarships be issued as soon as possible to maintain their studies. These requests are justified, and we certainly agree. However, the matter has a certain budget and procedures, and cannot be rushed. We are now preparing to issue the scholarships while intensifying the "Special Fundraising" and hope to raise the full amount before the end of this month, so that the scholarships can be issued as soon as possible, and the income and expenditure will be consistent with the budget. Not only will five thousand underprivileged students be able to study with peace of mind, but we scholarship workers will also be able to declare ourselves innocent. The responsibility for achieving this "perfect merit" rests entirely with enthusiastic people from all walks of life. Now the scholarship funds are urgently needed. It is hoped that readers will continue their efforts and persevere.</p>

You have been running the scholarship fund for many years, benefiting the underprivileged, and have achieved remarkable results. In addition to setting up ten free places each for senior and junior high school, in response to the special fundraising, all teachers and students of our school have been soliciting donations from viewers during the winter vacation. After two decades, we have received more than 240,000 yuan in donations. After a meeting, it was decided to allocate it to 12 underprivileged students who applied to the school. Now we will send the remaining 40,000 yuan in cash to Shen and Xin newspapers for use as scholarship loans. Our humble intention is to do our best.
