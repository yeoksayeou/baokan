<h3>馬歇爾與蔣主席在京　曾作兩小時秘談　願加速完成杜總統之使命</h3>
<p>暢談兩小時，情形極爲親睦。今日氣候雖不利於飛行，馬將軍仍在上午九時十五分，由南京機塲起飛赴重慶。臨行時，對於在京記者二十人並未發表任何宣言。蔣主席夫婦未與馬歇爾將軍同行，惟預料明日亦將飛渝，主持二十五日開幕之政治協商會議。昨晚將主席夫婦，在中國陸軍司令部之二層樓紅磚住宅內，設宴爲馬歇爾將軍洗塵，此外被邀列席者有美國駐華代辦勞勃生，中國方面美軍總司令魏德邁中將，中國陸軍總司令何應欽上將，府國參軍長兼翻譯官商震將軍，及京滬兩地市長。席間縱談各項問題，席散後，主席即與馬氏退入私室，討論重要問題，中國統一間題亦在其內。據聞馬將軍與主席初次會議，全部在親陸氣氛中進行，會議終時，由蔣夫人邀請馬歇爾將軍，魏德邁中將及勞勃生代辦，在重慶主席官邸同赴聖誕宴。此次主席破除舊習，親至機塲歡迎，藉表友誼，並於初次會談時顯示親善，足見兩人至少在初步討論各點上，意見十分融洽。馬氏表示抵渝後，對於中國複雜之內部問題，將深入各方面加以探討。據聞凡願與氏面談者，一律準備接見。現在重慶等候出席政治協商會議之中共代表，亦在其內。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京二十二日電〕新近抵華之馬歇爾大使，今晨離此赴渝，行前曾與蔣主席秘密會談兩小時，直至午夜方休，主席與馬帥向來賓告退後，即偕入主席之書齋。會談之內容性質，並未公佈，但觀乎會談時間之長與機密，可知此新任大使與中國國府元首問所談國事之嚴重。馬帥離京前宣稱：渠預期一到重慶，立即會晤現在重慶之共黨領袖，及其他各黨派人士，聽取彼等意見。馬帥於其來華之短促時期中，明示渠將在杜魯門總統之訓令下，儘量及儘速完成其使命。據氣象報告，重慶機塲因雨濘</p>
<h3>記者活躍競爭採訪</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二十二日電〕美國駐華特使馬歇爾將軍今日自南京飛抵重慶，機塲有美軍一大隊，咸欲一睹此前任美國陸軍參謀總長之丰采。中國記者在機塲守候者，數日之多，堪稱空前。外國記者十二人，原定先由南京飛渝，不料其指定之飛機，臨時忽以某種原因未能乘用，以致延遲，現正在京另候飛機。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二十一電〕由於美駐華特使馬歇爾元帥之抵京謁見蔣主席，衆多中外記者，亦雲集於此石頭城下。日本一九九」簽降以來，首都新聞採訪之活躍盛况，無有逾於此者。攝影記者及各電影公司特派員，今於光華門外機塲，及　主席行轅門前白熱化之競爭塲面，將爲此當有歷史意義之一幕，留下永久紀念。廣播記者及新聞記者，則亦始終緊緊追逐，冀將此生動資料，寫下珍貴之一頁。直至下午四時一刻，猶有十數人鵠候於茶會未畢之主席行轅門外，不願遽離。今日京中各通訊社之記者，幾全部出動，而上海方面，復有專機一架，送來記者十七人。</p>
<h3>麥克納今日返菲　昨曾晋京謁主席</h3>

<h3>熊市長非正式聲稱　奠都北平有可能　大北平計劃決繼續完成</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕平市長熊斌非正式對記者稱：北平有十分之七希望成爲中國未來國都。此間一般人士觀察，如東北接收順利，熱·察·綏獲得安定，則此事即有提早實現可能。據悉，美方對中國將政治中心移於北平一事，亦深感興趣，蓋天津日人所築新港完成後，平。津形勢與華盛頓。紐的極爲相似也。蔣主席留平期，對平市政極重視，曾面諭熊市長，整理故宮。景山等名勝古蹟。平市府已商同行營，由沒收敵偽財產物資中，撥出百之二十，作為整理費，敵前在平西郊興築之新北京，僅完成五分之一，當局決籌款續建，以完成大北平計劃。平日來水落水池鐵管，前被日人拆去，現僅三十餘洋井供水，故全市使用自來水者僅百分之三十，下水這則尚係明朝舊建，早已破壞不堪，熊市長亦表示決予整修，古城新生或不在遠矣。</p>

<p>〔中央社錦州二十二日電〕國軍頃自錦州沿鐵道向盤山方面推進，其第一目的地將爲營口。據前方傳來消息，部隊行進堪稱順利。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州二十二日電〕溝帮子新民間之鐵道，前爲共黨破壞，頃已完全修復。我沿鐵道前進之部隊，已進達靑堆子，我派赴瀋陽新民與蘇軍洽商交接防務之聯絡組，即在靑堆子候蘇方派員前來引導，逕赴新民，以便商洽接收瀋陽防務。又我由義縣北向埠新推進之部隊，即可到達靑河門。聯絡組亦在靑河門候蘇方派員迎至埠新商洽，北路雙方交接事宜，我派往赤峯與蘇方聯絡人員，亦俟部隊進至葉柏籌（凌準東北）後，我即在二龍（葉柏壽附近）候蘇方聯絡人員，再赴赤峯商洽，雙方防務交接事宜，日來三方面均已分途行動。</p>
<h3>東北各省主席　限令明年元旦前到任　長春市長已正式視事</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二十一日電〕接收東北工作，最近即可展開。哈爾濱市長楊綽庵定今日率首批市府人員赴長春轉哈，瀋市府九人亦同機出發。據悉：主席手令東北各省主席，限明年元旦前一律到達東北接收。目前侍出發之東北主席市長，有吉林鄭道儒，黑龍江韓駿傑，安東高惜氷，松江關吉玉，嫩江彭濟羣，合江吳翰濤，興安吳煥章，遼北劉翰東。大連市長沈怡，前赴渝近亦返平，待機出發。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春二十一日電〕東北行政接收工作，即正式開始，首先接收者，將爲長春市政。新任市長趙君邁，已定二十二日午十二時於參加中央銀行開幕禮後，正式到任視事。趙氏今晚曾與蘇軍城防司令卡洛夫少將晤談。張主委嘉璈今日下午一時由平飛返長春，交部特派員陳延烱，瀋陽市長董文琦，及長鐵監事高綸瑾等同來。董彥平李則芬及趙君邁市長等，均到機塲歡迎。張氏下機後，即令趙市長進行接收長春市政。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春二十二日電〕新任市長趙君邁，今午十二時，正式到任視事。前任市長曹肇元，即日辦理移交手續。市府所屬各局首長，暫仍舊，中下級職員，亦照舊供職。曹前市長已被延聘為市府諮議。</p>
<h3>中蘇談判略見好轉　美報稱蘇聯圖擴大勢力圈</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿二日電〕適於美國特使馬歇爾到京之時，中蘇談判，遷延不決者一月餘，現已略見好轉，惟尙未完成。據東北保安司令部駐平辦事處訊，杜聿明部已自錦州向瀋陽開拔。惟是吾在聖誕或新年開入瀋陽，則尚不得而知。就現狀觀之，國軍由美艦運輸，俾完成大規模登陸，似較樂觀。並聞此舉即係馬歇爾將軍與中國最高司令部會談結果之一。此外，並悉南滿鐵路長達二千三百餘華里，沿綫糾擾時起，鞍山各日本昭和鐵廠所在地，礦與廠均已關閉。瀋陽兩大化煉爐係在德國所造，已為蘇軍移走，吉林三大水力發電機亦已搬去。凡此種種重工業設備，即中蘇雙方所爭持不決，何者爲「戰利品」，何者應隨失土同時歸還中國。　〔路透社倫敦二十二日電〕每日電開報華盛頓特派員稱：美國外交界人士，已覺蘇聯有擴大其勢力圈至於中國東九省之意，恐蘇聯在伊朗北部阿日爾貝珍製造自治，以及向土爾其提出領土要求之故技，又將施之於柬九省，預料在數星期內，東北之蘇軍駐紥區內，即將有自治運動之出現。杜魯門總統於上星期六述及美國之遠東政策時，力言蘇聯應將東北之控制權交還中國中央政府，英美兩國根據一九四三年之開羅宣言，蘇聯根據本年七月之彼茨坦宣言，及八月之中蘇條約，均應尊重中國之解放，包括交還東北在內。最近華方報告謂中蘇談判之困難，實緣蘇聯要求與中國共管東北之全部重工業，此項要求，固未嘗爲中蘇條約所規定，由此可見蘇聯對於中國之東九省，確具相當野心。</p>

<h3>三強會談坦白友好　諒解障礙未全除　一般確信必能成立若干協定　有關中法問題隨時通知兩國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科二十二日電〕今日據接近美英蘇三國外長之消息靈通方面稱，莫斯科三國外長會議，現已達到「具體化時期。」三國對於重要國際問題，似已較會議開幕時更爲接近。彼比猜疑，大部份業已消釋，國際問題之諒解，陣碍雖未全除，但可信必能成立若干協定。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科二十二日電〕英美蘇三國外長及其最接近之顧問專家等，昨日曾作四小時半之非正式晤談，經過異常滿意，故已決定暫停舉行正式會議，於今日下午繼續舉行非正式之晤談。權威方面謂此等非正式之談話，可使參加諸人獲得較大之談話自由，故使談話範圍可以益見廣泛，各方面對於會談內容，仍力持緘默。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科二十二日電〕三强外長昨日舉行第六次會議。美關係方面昨夜聲稱，會議正切實進展中，會塲中繼續保持友善融洽之空氣。三方面關於各種廣泛之問題，均曾交換意見，迄至目前爲止，尚未發生重大阻碍。又悉，美大使哈立曼昨曾晤中國駐蘇大使傅秉常，聞對於中法兩國直接有關之一切問題，均曾知照兩國大使。</p>
<p>管制原子能　談話進展順利</p>
<p>又據倫敦消息靈通方面聲稱：三强關於原子能之談話進展順利，蘇聯當覺於明年一月聯合國召開全體大會時，恐不能根據華盛頓原子談話之建議，會同英美主持聯合國原子能委員會，但料蘇聯亦不致反對此一建議，或許仍可成爲該委員會之一員。一般咸信貝文與貝爾納斯向莫洛托夫所建議之原子能委員會如果成立以後，將就管制原子彈之製造，並以維持和平爲目的，而使用原子彈之範圍以內，向中英美蘇法及其他六國所組之安全理事會負責，將就發展原子能以供工業用途之範圍以內，向聯合國之全體大會負責。就目前趨勢觀，貝文及貝爾納斯恐將在莫斯科聖誕節。</p>
<p>蘇報對英美　作有系統攻勢</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十二日電〕蘇聯報章對英美之政策發動有系統之攻勢，其所攻擊之事件，幾全在三强會議議程以內。「眞理報〕領導抨擊英軍之駐在希臘。埃及·印度尼西亞及其他外國，此乃一種反擊舉動。蓋以伊朗方一再要求蘇軍退出伊朗，故蘇聯乃反駁英美何以於戰事結束以後，猶令軍隊駐在友邦。撤兵問題係整個問題，不能僅就伊朗之撤兵問題提出討論。英美之觀點，則爲協約軍之駐在伊朋，係以英蘇伊三國條約爲據，故解決撤退伊朗駐軍之問題，亦不能脫離該一條約。頃據本社自伊朗內地來電，謂目前之危機，可望由德黑蘭與大不列士直接交涉，三强旣已因伊朗問題而陷入僵局，則前項辦法亦不妨予以考慮。「眞理報」又一社評，曾論及美軍留駐中國之問題，最近蘇聯共他報紙之評論又涉及日本問題，故料莫斯科會議於談及遠東問題時，蘇代表當堅決要求共管日本，及美軍退出中國。土耳其問題是否將在莫斯科會議中提出討論，尚無暗示巡得，如果論及韃靼尼爾之問題，則英美外長之立塲，必當仍以兩國政府前此向土政府提出之照會爲準。</p>
<h3>列强勢力圈競爭　自東歐移至西亞　英帝國生命綫感威脅　前途危機正方興未艾</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十二日電〕紐約泰晤士報特派員稱：列强勢力圈之競爭地，已自東歐移至西亞，此等現象雖不足爲奇，然而英美之未爲預防，實難卸疏忽之責。目蘇聯於二月間正式要求修改蒙特奠協定後，中東之危機即形急轉直下，而下列三事之發生，適與此一危機之發展相吻合。（一）爲東歐諸圍選舉之舉行，及南保等國親蘇政權之成立，使蘇戰夢想已久之保護圈卒告成立。（一）爲伊朗外國駐軍撤退期近，如有行動，當及早採取。（三）爲協約國之重開淡判，已愈形迫切需要。</p>
<p>聯深知保護旣成事實，較要求將來之行動權爲易，故在莫斯科行三强會議之初，蘇聯即已完成旣成事實之佈置。關於伊朗問題，以生兩種現象，一　三强之競爭，一爲新舊社會制度之競爭，此二者具有相互密切之關係。就英美方面言，與其保護伊朋之社會及行政制度，不如逕行抨擊蘇聯之干涉，使英美本身亦可取斷然之行動。伊朗雖急需農村與社會之改革，然而英美在德黑蘭之勢力，尚未能在該方面有重大之建樹，而蘇聯在伊朗北部，則憑其巧妙之宣傳，頗能得下層階級及少數民族之擁護。英美所不解者，即爲蘇聯何以在伊北保持大量駐軍，更復在亞塞爾拜然事件發生前不久，增兵不已。蘇聯在中東之野心，可謂不小，莫斯科除希望取得戰靼尼爾區之根據地外，復擬取得土耳其亞美尼亞之一部，以建立更親蘇之政府。在伊朋方面蘇聯希望取得石油及其他讓與權，並擬取得通至波斯灣及亞門灣之路綫，獲得印度洋之暖水港。蘇聯之發展計劃，不但威脅英帝國之生命綫，亦有碍美國在沙地阿刺伯之油權，因此伊朗問題遂爲英美蘇三國爭執之焦點矣。英國已急遽與法國簽訂勒望特之協定，以修補其離笆上之裂口，然而巴勒斯坦問題仍令人感覺棘手，而蘇聯同可從中秘密煽動。伊朗問題之解決，似已必然與蘇有利，然而英國則不免因此遭一痛擊，甫如亞塞爾拜然與蘇聯成爲事實上之合併，則土耳其旣被包圍，而伊拉克亦受威脅。總之，目前中東形勢之發展，蘇聯已佔上風，然而前途之危機，則正方興未艾也。</p>
<h3>土耳其　願與蘇修好</h3>
<p>〔路透社安加拉廿二日電〕土耳其外長薩卡昨在國民議會宣稱：蘇聯雖未向土重訂友好及互不侵犯條約，然而並不影響土國希望與蘇修好之志願。土國之目的，爲對內對外均維持和平，吾人在過去及未來，當繼續一貫政策，即毋求於人，亦不予人。吾人仍準備與蘇促進友好關係，吾人當保持此一希望，以期達到目的。卡拉培基將軍曾稱，如外報所傳屬實。則吾人之北鄰似擬向我有所要求。世界應知海峽乃土耳其之咽喉，而卡爾斯高原乃土耳其之　幹，希望此一鄰邦能與我保持友誼，否則難免與雙方均有不利。按卡爾斯省位於土耳其東部，乃係於上次大戰後得自俄國者。</p>
<h3>英對東印問題　荷總理將訪英</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十二日電〕關係方面預料阿特里首相於下星期接見荷蘭總理薛美霍恩及荷印副督范莫克時，將告以英國深願於僑民之安全獲得保障後，立即訓令英軍退出印度尼西亞。英國並希望荷領袖與印度尼西亞領袖接洽，俾得成立協定。荷總理可望於二十六日率領范莫克及殖民部長勞傑曼抵運倫敦。阿特星首相準備縮短聖誕假期，提前與彼等會晤。英國之立塲乃爲英軍不能長期留駐印度尼西亞，英國雖有對荷蘭之責任，然不能以英軍作爲工具，强迫印度尼西亞人接受荷關之意志。最重要之點，在維持地方秩序，使談判得以順利進行。倫敦政界人士深切了解印度尼西亞問題之背量，然同時認爲目前在印度尼西亞已發生普進之民衆運動，實不容加以忽靦，英國雖不能確定撤兵之日期，但英國當聲明其維持秩序之意志，係以由關係方面儘速推動談判爲條件。</p>

<h3>新日本基礎完成　原有封建機構已剷除殆盡麥帥此後不頒發重要指令</h3>
<p>〔聯合社束京二十二日電〕麥帥總部今日宣稱：建設新日本之基礎工作，業已完成，此後不復頒發重要指令。欲圖造成一「恤全而合意之國家」，此後將全視日人根據指令進行改革之能力，並期共迅速予以完後加續有指令，當限於解釋，俾日人能瞭解無　，而完全遵行。　〔合衆社紐約二十一日電〕麥帥於一百餘日中，日本古老之封建機構已告剷除，並迅速奠定設立日本新民主政體之基礎。最高總司令迭發命令，達到此項目的，其中某幾項命令，達到如此嚴厲之程度，即東京之觀察家，亦恐其將遭公開抗，但日人對每一命令，則取完全順服態度。麥帥每發一指令，其聲望不惟不減，抑且日增。</p>

<h3>美報反對蘇聯　擴大共管日本</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿一日電〕霍華特系報紙撰社論稱：「傳蘇聯莫斯科會議中，正與麥克阿瑟統帥一博其手中之紙脾，冀獲取管理日本之大部權限」，該篇社論中對於此點表示强烈反對。文謂「我人不信吾人於政府將同意此事。蓋此種辦法將反資日人利用其貽患之烈，將與蘇聯在佔領德國所造成之混亂情形相彷彿，柏林之分權管理制，實屬不智已極，此其結果，徒使令人懊喪。</p>
<h3>日本政府計劃　改組行政機構</h3>

<h3>美名將巴頓溘世　德佔領區美軍下旗誌哀　遺體決安葬於歐洲戰塲</h3>
<p>〔本報東京二十二日專電〕麥克阿瑟元帥對於巴頓將軍之突然逝世，表示無限哀悼。據稱：巴頓將軍乃一英勇與豪爽之軍人，其人格之偉大，堅貞卓絕，永垂百世。此次突然溘辭入間，太平洋美軍將士，必將同表哀悼。</p>
<p>〔聯合社海特爾堡二十一日電〕巴頓將軍係因血塊在肺內發生壞疽，致心臟表弱，於睡眠中安然而逝。據美國第七軍參謀長韋倫少將發表公報稱：巴頓將軍已於二十一日晚十七時五十分，安然逝世，巴頓夫人自其夫於本月初旬撞車受傷後，即乘飛機至海特爾堡。將軍逝世時，其夫人隨侍在側。將軍遺體已決定葬於歐洲美軍長驅入德時所經路綫上之一地，大的將在盧森堡境內。巴頓將軍死時，距其撞車受傷時適爲十二日，德國美軍佔領區，奉命一律下半旗誌哀。</p>
<h3>美日開戰前夕　斡旋和平經過　近衛回憶錄作如是記述</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京二十二日電〕據紐的泰晤士報特派員白頓卡萊恩稱：此間朝日新聞每日分段刋載近衛所遣下之回憶錄，其中一段，指稱：一九四一年五月，日本內閣在海陸軍同意之下，已同意接受美國之要求，將日軍自中國撤退。據稱該回憶錄中業已公佈之一段，證明日方已瞭解在中國之冒險行動完全失敗，且已極度减弱日本，當日內閣接受美方建議時，日美雙方曾規定不得公佈中國方方面之和平，以免日方過份失面子。當時日方所同意之條件，包括左列各項：</p>
<p>（一）中國獨立；</p>
<p>（二）日軍自中國撤退；</p>
<p>（三）不併吞中國領土；</p>
<p>（四）不賠償損失；</p>
<p>（五）恢復門戶開放政策</p>
<p>（六）蔣委員長政府與汪精衛「政府」合併；</p>
<p>（七）限制日人大量移至中國；</p>
<p>（八）承認「滿洲國」。至於此種驚人之日方自由立塲，何以未能締結成爲協定，須俟朝日新聞之續稿刋出，方知分曉。根據近衛之圓憶錄（此回憶錄係在近衛未自殺前兩星期所寫成）日美和平談判之基礎，係於一九四〇年十二月份膩定，當時美國私人，包括天主敎主敎筆爾卡，亦參興其事，經過情形，頗有進展，日方乃於一九四一年四月八日以初步計劃送交美國務　赫爾，美方答復於同月十七十八兩日送遠日政府，當時美政府要求立即召開會議，前外相松岡適患重病，但仍對美仿難議，予以重大之修改。該項建議旋交付五月三日召開之會議，其時除松岡外，各人均主張將業經修改之計劃，立即送交美方，但松岡堅持日美須先締結中立條約，並主張先以此事之進行通知德國，內閣提出反對，但松岡終獲勝利。此事遂完全在其掌握中，松岡旋以訓令兩道電致日大使野村，其中之一係送致赫　之函件，內稱德義對勝利已有絕對之自信，並謂美方參加，僅能廷長戰事，毀滅文明，該函更着重言明日方不能採取有書於其盟友之舉，另一道訓令，則指示野村聲明中立條約係天皇之意志。</p>
<p>五月四日，松岡通知駐於東京之軸心使節，以一切在「絕對秘密」中進行之事告之，因此松岡之計劃未收成效，而美國之局勢亦因國防計劃之發展與夫護航隊事件而發生轉變。</p>
<h3>英國徇美國之請　對暹辦讓步　撤回一部份苛刻要求</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕今日來自盤谷之可靠消息稱：由於美國之壓力，英國已收還對暹羅最苛刻之要求多項。暹羅首相柏拉摩稱，「暹人對美殊為感激，因該國在我人多難之秋能出而協助」。當盤谷消息傳來時，華盛頓方面正傳說紛紜，某數方面以爲英國政府已放棄其大部份要求，惟食米要求爲例外。其他消息靈通方面則謂，倫敦依然要求暹羅賠償由日本與協約國空襲對英國財產所造成之一切損失，並稱除食米賠償外，英國尚要求暹羅負祖佔領軍費。據該方面訊，暹羅政府提出或作食米賠償或付空襲賠款與佔領費用，但如兩者兼顧，勢將使該國破產。</p>
<h3>美內建議夏威夷改州</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕內長伊克斯今日向國會建議，將夏威夷改爲美國一州。</p>
<h3>梨本宮等數人　即可獲得釋放</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿二日電〕據負責方面消息：管茂獄中梨本宮及其他戰爭娥疑犯數名，即將釋放。據美國首席檢察官季南稱：對於某某戰爭嫌疑犯，如證據不足，自當予以釋放。</p>
<h3>增强聯合國機構　使成為世界政府　莫外次貝克發表演說　籌委會工作已告結束</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦二十二日電〕英國外務次官貝克昨晚歡電籌委會各國代表團領袖，即席發表演說稱，聯合國機構必須成爲世界政府，吾則形同虛設。同時渠並號召在歐洲立即設立一堅强之區聯合國機構。渠稱：「當今之時，我人須將志向謀高，輕淡之方法不足以解決重大問題。余意聯合國機構必須眞正成爲世界政府，其在美國之新址，必須成爲全世界之政治首都。」貝氏發表此演說時，　委會議已成尾聲，預料至星期日可以結束。下次五十一國代表衆首時，將在明年一月十日聯合國大會第一次正式會議中重行相見。</p>
<p>籌備委會　工作檢討</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十二日電〕籌委會實際上業已結束，行政及預算兩小組會之工作，大約仍須延至週末，可以告一段落，然而其他生要問題，則均已獲得解決。大致而論，經過尚稱滿意。籌委會所討論之生要問題，有下列數項：</p>
<p>（一）聯合國機稱會址，決定設在美國，由小組會在參加競選之美國諸城中選出五城，交全體大會作最後決定。（二）決定不設臨時託治委員會，委治國家應負責變更委治爲託治。其起草之協定，應向聯合國大會首次會議之初期提出，託治協定應由全體大會之託治委員會審查。（三）全體大會應設一般委員會，執行指導任務，其組織及職權均已議定。（四）對於各種特種機構，如國際勞工局等之關係，交全體大合討論。　由此以觀，前由執委會遺下之四項主要問題，已由籌委會解決其三，僅特種機構之問題，未能由籌委會議定，再就籌委會此次開會之情形觀之，各代表均願意接受多數之意見，此乃聯合國機構前途之好現象。</p>
<p>各國形成分區集團</p>
<p>惟此次各國代表於投票之際，似均有組成分區英團之趨勢，蘇聯。烏克蘭。白俄羅斯·波蘭·南斯拉夫·及捷克等國代表結成之集團最爲緊密，美國領導南美諸國代表結成之集團，較見鬆弛。英國與各自治領及西歐諸國家亦形成一集團，至於中國代表往往喜於發生相對之意見時，提出折衷之安協辦法。總之，聯合國籌委會之工作結果，頗堪令人樂觀，然各國代表結成築團之現象，似屬不甚妥當。再有言者，莫斯科會議之舉行，實際上係以聯合團機構以外之列强關係，決定聯合國機構之任務，此不啻爲强權政治之重演，實非戰後世界之所宜也。</p>
<p>托管區民准許發言</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿一日專電〕經連議續三次會過之畏期辯論後，聯合國籌委會之技術小組會已通過烏克蘭代表所提關於修正託管理事會某一程序法則之建議，即予託管理事會以權力，使其得用各種不同方法，保證受託管地區之人民，得有充分發表其意見之可能。例如若有代表機關存在，應准其發表言論，舉行發言人之公開選舉，與當地之民族組織進行協商舉行普選，由託管理事會派特別代表與託管地區之人民直接接洽等。</p>

<h3>對撤退黎敘駐軍英法間成立協定</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦北二日電〕昨日公布英法所訂關於撤退里文達國境（即叙黎兩國）英法駐軍之協完，雙方議定由聯合國機構對里文達區之安全，作最後之決定，在由聯合國機構接收以前，仍由英法在該地保留適當數量之駐軍，以保陣該地之安全。英法駐軍之撤退，務期同時完成。英法政府復保證決不在中東區域從事有損對方利益或責任之行動。據本社外交記者稱，聯合國機構何時始能決定里文達區之安全保障辦法，以及此等辦法之形式若何，猶不能於此次協定中窺見其梗概。</p>

<p>麥克阿琴唁電中悲哀地說：『巴頓將軍在美女厲的狀態中死去，給我以最深刻的哀傷。他是驍勇而瀟灑的軍事家。整個太平洋部隊都一定要痛悼他。』我現在把上面這幾句單純而有力的悼詞，從東京麥帥總部發來的電訊中譯出後，遙想我們曾經跟着巴頓將軍駢肩作戰的全團軍民們，聽聆到這個凄厲的噩耗時，也一定可能引起痛切的哀感，甚至於爲他而低頭誌哀，爲他而澘然流淚！</p>
<p>巴頓的出身</p>
<p>巴頓將軍，美國加里福尼亞人，今年適逢六十華誕。少年時，即精於射擊術。又是個運動健將，曾出席於瑞典京城舉行的世界運動會，並曾顯露其崢嶸的頭角，大好的身手。</p>
<p>他以坦克車戰鬥家的雄姿，博世人的稱羨。他創立過第一個坦克車學校。他統率過坦克旅攻打德軍，建立極大的戰功。</p>
<p>善哉，麥帥之言！我們悼念巴，頓將軍，第一要紀念他的驍勇。在冬天，他生前喜歡穿一套棕色的皮外套，喜歡坐在一輛坦克車裏率領部衆在前錢上指揮作戰。他最服膺於「身先士卒」，「臨陣督戰」的精神。他的格言就是他常封他部下說的話，不但是說說而已，並且是身體力行。請你傾聽一下吧！他說：</p>
<p>『前進，不斷的前進！一直到最後的一顆子彈和最後的一滴汽油都已用盡，你們仍然要跑步前進！』</p>
<p>遠征的小史</p>
<p>在第一次歐戰時，巴頓將軍因勳業卓著，即由上尉級銜晋陞至上校，所獲獎章殊多，旋任潘興將軍參謀官。戰後任騎兵訓練官，騎兵團團長等職。迨一一次歐戰爆發後，驍勇善戰的巴頓將軍便奉命率部實行遠征，義，法，比，德，奧，捷諸國之戰役，他都一一親臨前綫，身先士卒，指揮作戰，造成許多次絢爛無比的戰績。在西西里戰役中，我們不會忘記巴頓將軍的勇猛。他曾經從舟中躍入海心，率軍登達彼岸，完成了他計劃中的戰略。</p>
<p>瀟灑的軍人</p>
<p>麥克阿瑟元帥稱讚巴頓將軍的驍勇善戰，大致可由此例中獲一明證。至於爲什麽要頌揚其灑灑浪漫呢？那麽也有實例可舉。巴頓將軍，決不是一個頭腦簡單的武人，相反的，他却是個文武全才，或者可以稱之爲詩人一樣的武人較爲妥貼。戎馬倥惚，不忘吟咏，是其特殊的嗜好之一。生平著有詩集兩卷，爲美國各界所知，現在，他已經不及覩其出版而謝世？這是可以惋惜的。此外，關於他的坦克車作戰理論的遺著，値得我們介紹。</p>
<p>直搗德本土</p>
<p>去年，當美國尚在對德作戰的時候，他是以第三軍軍長的姿態出現在戰塲上的。他從諾曼第實施突擊戰衛，統率了他的裝甲部隊縱執法境，直搗阿丹納區，換句話說，他已經打進了納粹德國的陣地。這一個巨大的攻勢，給了德軍以致命的打擊，攻破了敵將倫資台德的最後反攻的計劃。同時，他的部下第四裝甲師團，趁此時機從倫納衝入德國南部，以日行八十英里的最高速度深入敵人復方。此後又在四十二天之內，進軍之勢益猛，竟創造了每日平均一百英里的新紀錄。</p>
<p>德國戰敗後，巴頓將軍就任德境美軍佔領區東區司令，後調任第十五軍軍長，勞續特著。現在，他死了，聽說他不久就要殯葬於歐洲公墓裏，不，不，他將活在聯合國全體軍民的心上，活在我們的記憶裏。</p>
<h3>倫敦半月滿目呈現新氣象</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　朱家讓</p>
<p>由巴黎去倫敦，飛一小時即到。若由火車則須渡越不列顚海峽，述頭帶尾共需十六小時之譜，其實中間一半時間費在英法邊界的查騐護照種種手續。英法的火車第一回趁，出乎意料，竟與國內的無甚兩樣，雖然坐的頭等夜車，却無臥舖設備，大家眼巴巴的坐過一夜。早晨天亮了才登船，眼見白浪滔滔，海天無際，一九四〇至四一年的驚濤駭浪過去了，此後該是風和日暖的季候了</p>
<p>車下維多利亞站，有名的霧都竟全部籠罩在朦朧迷漫中。老大而稠密的建築物在昏黃的燈光下，看不出個所以然，但見雙層黃色公共汽車在馬路接連奔馳，市街門面以及紅綠燈，住慣上海香港的人看了，並不覺得異樣，因爲全出一型。倫敦車站的脚夫以及一切公用交通員司，與法國一樣，多由女性充任，不過其體格粗邁，孔武有力，猶勝法人。記得那天下車，那個替我們提行李推小車的女人，竟令我們跑得很費力，才追上去。</p>
<p>倫敦的一般老大的氣概，表現得十分充分而普遍。普通一家商店公司的招牌上，每多寫着「一八八一」或「一九〇一」這些字樣，以示賣老。建築不像巴黎這樣的濃裝淡抹，工於雕琢，但高大軒昻，無分伯仲；尤其外表薰滿焦烟，不稍修刷，因爲這就是歷史的紀錄。全城面積廣闊，地下火車無遠勿届，似較巴黎更整潔舒適。跟上海一樣的雙層黃色公共汽車凡一百餘路，整天奔馳，一個女賣票負一忽兒跳上樓，一忽兒又滾下樓一息不停地幹，體格差些那吃得消。此外也是倫敦的老大象徵，便是出差汽車式樣宛似中世紀的馬車，開車的都是老頭子，惟坐在裏面却很舒適</p>
<p>紀念性建築　設在熱鬧中心區</p>
<p>硏究倫敦的歷史也很久遠，其發軔實在靠泰晤士河的一條地帶，所以那裏的樣子特別老；路狹得都像上海的四馬路或畫錦里，很多僅許單程交通。房子雖結實，一點不摩登。跨河而過的鼓樓橋（Tower　Bride）形似兩座堡壘，中間　面可以吊起來，是古老的代表之一，再沿泰河南下，過倫敦滑鐵盧兩座新式大橋，是有名的成斯敏斯大敎堂，係十一世紀的偉構。憑河一座長方形的龐然巨物，便即世界憲政之母英國的巴力門（Parliament）。</p>
<p>威斯敏斯大敎堂跟羅馬的聖彼得堂同其偉大，而情調各殊，前者滿目蒼老，後者精敎獨步。威斯敏斯建於一〇五〇年，舊爲國王加冕或舉行聖典處所，其建築另有一工祭臺唱持班以及大風琴都有肅然之感。禮拜天做禮拜的人雖很多，但在偌大堂中竟還不過一角而已。西洋人以敎堂為個人修養及　性敎青之地，人的生死問題在未獲科學確實答復之前，宗敎還擁有不動的勢力。感斯敏斯亦爲歷代最偉大人物歸宿之所，四週都是大理石棺，附以無數　像及碑語，這比較葬之遼遠山野易爲後人追念，方法似有可取。我們中國以後要造無名英雄墓，或任何名人紀念建築，我建設亦要改在市中心然鬧區，這才有意義。</p>
<p>英國憲政大堡壘　　巴力門內幕</p>
<p>英國的巴力門終年鬧哄哄，近自邱吉爾下台，工黨當政，因爲主義不同法案更張，下議院的空氣更覺天天緊張，舌戰無虛日。這回我曾去參觀一次，這座英國憲政的堡壘內分兩部，即貴族院與下議院，各有會塲，圖書館委員會室，辦公室，以至餐廳，茶室。高高的巨型鐘樓，依事打着鏗鏘而老練的交響音節，所報的是標準格林威治時間，每天並向全球廣播。寬闊的泰晤七河水在它底下永遠無言的流淌，正像一部流水賬般地默默在記取大英帝國多少尊榮富貴，以迄患難而今復甦過來，所謂巴力門，現在大權集在下議院，政府一切的措施無一逃得了人民代表的審查與質問。英國崇尚自由，隨便阿貓阿狗，尚且可在赫特公園內信口開河，做到議員在議會暢所欲言，自然更是他的責任。於是每天開會，詢問多極了。每週開會自星一至星五，從下午二點起，總要弄到深夜九十點鐘才歇。議員們吃茶吃飯都在裏頭，上週有一次甚至一部分人因爲太晚了脫了火車，便睡在巴力門，計算時間每天平均七八小時，英國人的開會本領確也不小。但是他們的議塲是怎樣局面，偉大嗎？假使你抱着很高希望，又包會大出意料。這樣重要次策以及首腦政爭的會塲，實不過重慶中央黨部的禮堂大小，不過四週附設小樓，以供新聞記者及旁聽者列席而巳。會塲設備也不怎講究，議員席相對而坐，依例政府黨居右，在野（即反對派）黨在左，一排排的長皮墊椅，大家隨便而坐，前面亦並無可供閱讀或書寫用的桌板，不能不謂簡率，然或謂自昔相承，索性就「保守」下去了。開會的時間除有政府首相或閣員報告外，全部花在質問辯論及通過法案。問題多如牛毛，任何性質都得提出。記得邶天去參觀，二百多個質問中，有一個是請問政府在某一個同時期中，所用信箋信封，較之議會取自政府文具供應部者比較如何。由此可見英國的閣員部長眞不好做，一則要十足專家數字常能搬得出，再則修養也得特別到把，吾則倘使發下脾氣，這可玩不得的。議員們在塲內儀態，似比我國會塲生動，我那天一走進去便聽到笑聲自然，幷不「嚴肅」；而欲附議他人所言，亦不經舉手手續，即可隨便連聲「Yes」。他們在座有的也把雙脚擱在椅上，但每次進退都向主席台就地鞠躬，彬彬有禮。</p>
<p>一百八十度轉變　英政府情動盪</p>
<p>今日英國的政情，有中央社報導，自無庸我來絮絮，但在能述英國議會不能不連帶道及，即是戰後這國家的大政方針，朝着社會主義的方向走，但因當前經濟困難，物資不裕，重以自由資本主義至今數百年，一切向來民營，今欲一百八十度轉變，當然在心理上也太不習慣。再則，工黨上台，力事計劃經濟及國家化，然遠水不濟近火，人民望治心殷，他們所亟盼的生活改善，統制解禁，但照現在情形，工黨政府反聲言現行配給制尚要五年，而且國營方案無限伸展。英國舊日的鐵道郵電，甚至英蘭銀行，都係民營，現將逐漸收歸國有，對外貿易及金融統制嚴緊，政府叫人民塡的表格日多一日，故攻擊空氣亦日嚴重。前保守黨首相邱吉爾上週在該黨大會，把工黨駡得兇，說他們施政失其緩急輕重倒置，只是天天畫表格叫人民塡，看光景也快像我國流行的「臨表涕泣」了。邱老前天過了他七十一齡的生辰，預備這週要跟阿特里在議會大辯論。</p>
<p>大致說來，英國因受戰事深刻的影響，人民的生活確還在掙扎與苦熬的邊綠上，所好政治淸明有效率，故必要的供應尚多具備，但管制嚴密，因此不必要或無名份的物資竟眞的無法取得。這是英國人獨一無二的政治長才，人家及不上；而英國之所以有今日，竊恐亦就靠此命脈。目前英人的享用誠談不到，在一個從重慶抵英的人看來，固然他們的衣住行三者都要比國內强，但食就太差，差得油水太不够，脂肪起恐慌。館子裹吃飯照限價吃不餉，除非把麵包硬塞。中國館子也許當局特別客氣可有特別飯吃，但要化上十先令，多出二一倍。英國現正鬧人力短紬，女人都出來做了事，但詢其工資，都是很低，據說現在一般中下薪工階曆每週皆不過四五鎊，以此區區，除舊租不生問題外，自僅可吃吃自助凔（英美現盛行一切自取可省茶役）苦苦挨日，不容許再作什麽交際應酬了。但這情形仍不能與我國相比，因爲根本物價不甚漲，女人照舊可以塗抹打扮，電影院究還以職業男女居多；再說重慶薪工階級買報紙看已經很吃力了，但這裏尚不算回事，這也是例子。</p>
<p>民主政治上軌道　生活緊張化　　看英國的政治經濟以及社會措施，若舍其是非得失成敗而就其精神以觀，實有令人欽服之處。英國的政治憑其長久民主基礎，確可說得上軌道了。固然英國內閣的部門太多，而且地位不齊，名稱參雜，但官常風紀行政能率，自很不差。英國的內閣首相閣員薪俸　殊，首相年俸一萬鎊，大部長（如外財軍等部）六千，小部長據說僅有一千，扣去一筆沈重的所得稅，使小部長也感到不易維持，而曾提出加薪要求，然亦足見他們大槪眞靠薪俸過活。英人的政治手腕有其特點，對經濟與社會政策，似更有其深謀碩劃。一個貝佛理治的社會安全計劃，是每個人民自生至死的全部保險，將由工黨政府付諸實施，然在以往即已有很好的安全制度。這只要看每個英國人何論是何身份，常備兩種登記卡，一是健康卡，一是就業卡，平時由雇主興其本人按月向就近的政府主管機關繳納很小的費用，一到有病，即可憑卡就醫要藥，分文不花。如果失業了，也就　就業卡向政府領取規定救濟金。這固然是資本主義時代的產品，然社會安全的規模便粗具了，惟規在一般人民亦有反對這種政策的，以爲從此大家可以不必太努力，反正政府總給飯吃，我們太辛苦，徒然養了不辛苦的人，又何必太賣力當優子呢？實在天下事總是一反一正，政府惟有在方法上再求嚴密公道與合理。</p>
<p>倫敦情形比巴黎似乎緊張得多，馬路上人這樣擠，個個都是好像要公在身，走得急，沒有踏方步。建築物把街市擠得緊，中間又是車水馬龍，反映到心情上格外忙迫。再說這國際政治經濟的樞紐多少風雲冠蓋來往此地，聯合國組織的預備會大的要到月中才散，以後的節目還在接踵而來。原子彈的問題，紐倫堡的開審，華盛頓借款談判，美國飛機减價競爭糾紛，以至工黨政府再接再厲的國營計劃，工廠罷工狂潮，塡滿了每天各種各式的報章，艦隊街一天發出來的報紙不亞千萬份，像泰晤士報每天要出七次版，定也定不到，一早就搶購一空。標準夜報早晨就在開始。倫敦人時刻關心着切身民生問題，又來或忘懷世界的發展，因此這城市除了白金漢宮還見一片幽靜而外，便處處顯得緊張與忙迫了（卅四，十二，五，寄自倫敦）</p>
<p>美國兵士的復員工作，一部份業已開始。圖示返國美軍，重理舊業，在鐘錶店裏，硏究修錶技術。</p>
<h3>從國際友誼上研討　美蘇異同點　本報編譯室　譯自十二月十八日大陸報</h3>
<p>美蘇這兩個大陸國家，對新獲得的世界和平負着比任何國家更重的責任。這兩國的力量併合起來，可保持這世界的秩序。他們能平衡國際的管力，調整人類聞不定的困離，同時能聯合其他大小國家，保障世界安全的組織，反之，這兩大力量如果發生歧離，任何國際的結合都將受其阻礙。</p>
<p>美蘇兩國所蘊育的偉大力量，如果不把牠導入建設之途，那些研究原子能的科學者，還不如即刻乘着飛箭逃向金星去，免得跟地球一塊兒毀滅。到今天，人類對物理學的造詣巳經到了高峯，不容你不把政治與這種發明配合起來了。</p>
<p>兩大樞軸　華盛頓莫斯科</p>
<p>世界上存在着兩種根本衝突的政治制度，其樞軸一在華盛頓，一在莫斯科。如果在這兩國間能劃出一滿意的分界綫，原子專家們可驅使原子能來掃除沙漢和北極的荒地，比較更有意義。</p>
<p>這兩國具有共同點甚多：他們都經過革命流血而建國，都擁有大量的殖民地。美國的拓荒者，朝西向海洋移民，蘇聯的拓荒者，朝東向海洋移民。他們都以一個海洋——太平洋——爲目標。在擴張領土這一方面，美蘇很相似。美墨之戰及收買加特斯登兩事，正與蘇聯之越高加索入土耳其斯坦及深入蒙古與滿洲相同。</p>
<p>美蘇兩國都有其獨特的實業革命，使國富與國力都發生甚大變動。美國因煉油業及實業之西移，完成了內河遝輸的路綫，蘇聯因開發原料，亦將其實業越島拉爾而東移。</p>
<p>此外，是美蘇那種成熟的國家形式的相同，他們兩者都投進了國際事件的漩渦中，不再採取傳統的孤立主義。蘇聯控制着歐亞兩洲大部的土地與政治力量，決不會再蹙居於孤立的一角，美國稱雄於南北美及七大海洋，也決不會再回到一八一二年傑菲遜總統時代。</p>
<p>放棄孤立　投身國際漩渦</p>
<p>傳統這東西，不論在國家或個人，都很難將牠忘記。美國一般人因先前的敎訓，迄今仍認爲英國是老奸巨猾，往往要喫牠的虧。所以美國民衆實際上不信任他們海外的外交代表，以爲處於圓滑的外國人間，難免要受人的騙。蘇聯也有這種本能的感覺。牠始終不信任任何外國。牠翻過歷史，知道牠曾先後被蒙古，土耳其，瑞典，波蘭，及日本擊敗，又曾遭拿破崙，德皇威廉，三國聯輩的攻擊，所以對這些鄰國和一切威脅的武力，具有歷史性的不信任。蘇聯紙有一道邊疆，沒有出過　子，那就是美國。</p>
<p>大陸國家　精神心理相通</p>
<p>一般的美人和蘇聯人間，具有很多心理上相同的地方。說起來，也許是人類的通性。他們都很大量，率直，並且傾向極端—極端的誇大，幽默，酣飲。他們還都非常醉心於體積，不是造世界最高的大厦，就是築世界最大的堤岸。兩者都走着偏鋒，把高等和下等揉合在一起，產生了兩種不同的傾向，一是優越的自信，一是對落後的懼怕。</p>
<p>美蘇兩國精神上的異同，使世人激發很高的興趣。自由是美國理想的基礎，社會安全則是蘇聯的礎石。當然，這兩個極端間是可能妥協約，因爲美國所謂自由對於餓得要死的人並沒有用處，而蘇聯所謂社會安全，對拓荒者也是沒有意義的。</p>
<p>現在要進一步談談美蘇兩國間互相了解的程度。</p>
<p>『在蘇聯，雖仍有怠惰，割據政治，浪費時間，限制，專制，和警察制等情，但美國人如因此就抹殺這世紀中偉大的實騐制度，以爲牠僅是代表無神論，憲兵制，排隊領麵包等，那正像說美國祗代表罷工，私刑，種族歧視等一樣的不合理。</p>
<p>當此美蘇關係正在發展之際，這種錯誤的見解，必須藉彼此思想及敎育的交換而予以糾正。</p>
<p>相互探求　作為國交參考</p>
<p>在共產主義的蘇聯，他們的智識階級會告訴你：「這裏還沒有共產主義，我們正朝着這目標做去。我們現在所有的祗是國家社會主義。」這裏仍舊有大富翁——大半是在黑市中賺飽的——集體農民，和乞丐。在史太林主義之下，仍舊存在着彼得一世所創造的「能力貴族」，如藝術家，工程師，將軍等。所不同的，祗是他們沒有官銜，而其特權也不能由子孫承繼罷了。</p>
<p>如果說蘇聯是個謎，不能爲外界所了解，那麽這句話顯然是陳腐的。美蘇兩國至今尚未相知，此後應互相探求對方的優點和缺點，作爲國交的參考。</p>
<p>就正常的國際關係而說，美蘇間並沒有競爭的主要理由。因爲兩者都擁有原料，工業，人力，和國內市塲。兩者在戰時或平時，都能自己照顧，美蘇正可藉此機會互相貿易，例如以木材。汽油·礦產·皮毛·交換·器工具·機製品·及工業發明等。</p>
<p>原子炸彈　促進復興速度</p>
<p>但兩者所以發生摩擦，有如下三個理由：（一）互不信任，（二）經濟思想之分歧，（三）對自由安全問題見解的不同。</p>
<p>自原子炸彈發明後，很奇怪的，這兩大國家却反而協調起來了，而且並不是由於恐懼或嫉妬。蘇聯常覺得爲國防而訓練的常備軍，使國庫支出甚大，現在新武器已經發明，正可籍此騰出大量人力，以供工廠。礦務。及農業方面之需，使戰後之復興，可以增加其速度。</p>
<p>目前，美國是最大的右翼國，蘇聯是最大的左翼國。兩者各自對本國的生活及統治方面的保護，都寄予非常小心的關懷。如果能以行動互相保證，大家沒有衝撞對方，或强迫對方作社會改革的私意，沒有第一次歐戰時期的國外武裝千涉，或從前曾存在過的第三國際，那麽兩國間的友誼，是不無增進的。這希望如一旦實現，蘇聯門戶洞開，蓋外國人有考察和硏究的機會，那時，美國將開始瞭解紅的不一定都是敵性的。（蘇爾慈勃格作）</p>

<h3>公醫制度</h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>什麼呌做「公醫制度」？</p>
<p>在說明什麼是「公醫制度」之前，我先謂大家注意一下：此刻我們如果生了病，要請醫師，買藥，這醫藥兩椿事項，往往要花費許多金錢。結果怎麽呢？自然是有錢的人有辦法把病治好，沒有錢的人只好聽憑疾病的麼折。而且「貧」「病」往往互爲因果，循環相尋，愈貧愈多病，愈病愈致貧。生病本來是痛苦的事，生了病而得不到醫藥，可又沒有一件事比這個再可憐了。</p>
<p>再從醫藥本身來說，醫術和藥物本來是濟世活人的，但是現在都變成商品了，有些醫生替病人看病，病勢愈重，他要錢就要的愈凶，這樣他的醫道就變成了敲竹槓的工具。，有些藥品效騐很好，可是代價很高，譬如有一種美國發明的新藥，送到我們中國來，在市面上不容易買到，結果一瓶藥就要出到拾萬二拾萬的代價。需藥變成了商品，醫藥本身的價値也就低落了。這也是一種不合理的現象！</p>
<p>從前一般有錢的人，看到窮苦人家生病可憐，常常做些施醫捨藥的善舉，這是救濟性質的慈普專業。現在因爲民主潮流的激盪，許多人都認爲政府對於人民，逢到他們生病的時候，應當擔負醫藥上的責任。國父孫中山先生提倡三民主義，在民生主義一方面，他也竭力主張我們應當利用國家的力量，使得人民個個人都能過安樂的生活，所以他在另一篇演講裏，主張政府應當替人民解次醫藥問題，不要呌窮苦的人生了病，除了聽其自然之外，沒有一點法子可想。病弱不治，對於個人固然是一個打擊，對於國家也是一種損失。現在若果由國家劉人民擔負醫藥上的實任，使得人民無論窮富，遇到生病的時候，都可以得到適當的治療，這制度就呌做「公醫制度」。</p>
<p>在公醫制度底下，醫衛和藥物不再成爲有錢人專用的東西，也不再是商品了。醫藥的利用，從此也進步到了一個新的時代。</p>
<p>現在世界上實行公醫制度最有成效的國家，是蘇聯和新西蘭。新西蘭的辦法是這樣的：全國劃分做四十二個區域，依照人口的多少和面積的大小，平均分設各種醫療機構，例如醫院，產院，牙科診所等等。這些醫療機構的經費，一半是從地方稅收當中撥付的，一半是由中央政府補助的。經費的管理，另外當地人民公選的董事組織董事會來負責。在新西蘭，全部醫院診所當中，有百分之九〇都是政府設立的，其餘百分之一〇的醫院診所，雖然是私立的性質，也由政府補助一部分的經費。從一九四〇年起。新西蘭政府規定，所有全國的醫院診所，一槪免費治療。私立的醫院診所，也是這樣。不過私立的醫院診所，治療一個病人，政府每星期就給他補助金二磅。對於病家方面，政府另外有一種補助。凡是每星期收入不滿五鎊的家庭，遇到有十六歲以下的兒童生病的時候，政府就每星期給他補助費四先令；凡是十六歲以上的人民，生了病不能工作，政府每星期發給他一筆疾病補助費，數目大的是七先令左右。</p>
<p>蘇聯的公醫制度施行得更澈底。他的辦法可以總括成幾點來說：</p>
<p>（一）所有的醫事人員，包括醫師、藥師、護士、助產士等，都是國家的公務員，其中大多數都是由政府供給薪俸，聽政府調遣的。</p>
<p>（二）所有的醫療機構，都是由政府設立，或者由政府發動社會力量，在政府嚴格的監督之下設立的。</p>
<p>（三）人民的醫療費用，都由政府負擔，換句話說，就是所有醫費藥費一切都是由政府從捐稅收入上面開支的。</p>
<p>（四）在醫藥衛生的技術上，打破「預防」和「治療」的界限，把「預防」和「治療」兩件事看做一件事。　現在我們可以明白「公醫制度」的意義了。綜括起來說，所謂「公醫制度」，有這樣幾個特點：</p>
<p>（甲）從政治的觀點說，他是由政府對人民在醫藥需要上負全部責任的制度：</p>
<p>（乙）從經濟的觀點說，他打破了私有財產制度對於人民醫藥需要所加的限制。</p>
<p>（丙）從社會的觀點說，他使得活人濟世的「醫」和「藥」，不再成爲市塲上的商品。</p>
<p>（丁）從技術的觀點說，他打破了醫學上把「預防」和「治療」分做兩件事的缺陷。</p>
<p>我們中國，要實現國父的三民主義，在醫藥衛生方面，一定也要採取這樣的制度。所以在國民黨五屆八中全會上，通過了一個「實施公醫制度以保障全民健康」的議案，共後政府就根據了這個議案，積極的計劃實行。二十九年五月，行政院公佈了一個「縣各級衛生組織大綱」，配合「新縣制」，規定每一縣設立一個衛生院，縣以下每一區設立一個衛生分院，每一鄉鎭設立一個衛生所，每一保設置一個衛生員。據就計，到三十三年七月爲止，後方二十省一千三百六十一縣當中，已經設立衛生院的有九百三十八縣，衛生分院共有一百九十六處，鄉鎭衛生所共有一千五百六十一所，保衛生員共有一千五百七十七人。這是實行「公醫制度」的初步，就是要在組織方面使得醫療機構普遍全國，而且深人民間。不過實行這樣一種制度，困難非常之多。最重要的是：「公醫制度」的推行，需要大量的人才和經費，而我們現在對於這兩項，一時就沒有適當的辦法。但　國父告訴我們：「知之維艱，行之匪艱」，只要我們相信這種制度，認爲這種制度非得實行不可，用我們全國的力量去擁護他，促成他，我相信即使再有更大的困難，也一定可以圓滿解次的。我說「全國的力量」，意思是這事靑不但要政府出力，同時也要全國人民大家合作。只有這樣，才可以使得這個制度早日實現。我今天特別提出這個題目來，一方面是希望大家明瞭這個制度，同時更希望大家擁護這個制度，促成這個制度。</p>

<h3>大戶出力拉抬　華股猛進不已　公債挫外股堅定</h3>
<p>公債初因報載即日起本埠可以付息，本金則尚須待關稅積有存數而還之訊，業中人不乏脫手者，丙種降至六三〇元以下，雜牌降至三五〇元以下，後以北帮略購，得以支持，午刻以股市之刺激，散戶陸續活動，重又回出七百元大關，而以高價收市，惟結果仍較前收微挫。</p>
<p>華股以證券業同業公會，定週日在市商會開成立大會，八十家老經紀人亦已於前日集會，前途希望甚濃，新多紛紛參加，陣容堅强，證劵業中兩大戶購永紗及新光殊力，價遂極度燦爛，新光以廠址失愼，上場一度降至三十四元，有供無求，屈居景福之下，達二元之多，迨後大戶落手拉提，散戶亦紛紛跟進，立見回漲至四十元外，依然領導小熱，紗廠亦有大戶新多加入，較美亞生色殊多，求過於供下，午刻多以高價收市，結果較前收永紗漲四十元，美亞祗五元，景福二元，勤興一元，新光則平，惟午後買氣不息，永紗漲到七三〇元，美亞五六五元，新光四三元，大戶拉抬下，人心倍極興奮。</p>
<p>外股初時因多方略有脫手，一度見疢，但證劵帮仍有吸收，投資者亦再接再厲，午刻仍見堅定，結果較前收榮辱互見，求供尚屬平衡，交易亦漸告增多，惟市價以各號求供互異，頗有參差。</p>

<p>鈕宣慰詞</p>
<p>此次來滬，主席諄屬調查各方面困苦情形，加以訪問，重大者請示辦理，餘則就地或交主管部解決。我國習慣上向有一種忌諱，知而不言，以至發生許多隔膜，希望諸君儘量供獻意見，最好有一書面報告，則將來轉呈中央，可作一訪問證件。至於學校公私立本屬一體，私立學校能補助國家之不及，厥功允偉，幸各本初衷，發揚而光大之。次由杭敎次致詞</p>

<p>本人過去主持本市敎育，與諸君均屬老友，在重慶時，即深知八年中之諸君堅貞不貳，今在顧李二局長領導之下定更能擴而大之。近來行政方面，業已統一，諸位際此新時代，作新建設，最要者即校址·經費·師資·設備·四大問題，如欲辦理一完善之學校，則缺一不可，但此四大問題，目下已感棘手，而奸商囤貨居奇者，尚大呼困苦，殊不知抗戰期間，眞正困苦者，乃敎育界同人，最好向此輩大腹賈勸募助金，以謀解決。隨後顧李二局長相繼致詞畢，周斐成氏代表市敎育會發表意見，旋各校校長分別中述私校困難情形，並遞呈</p>
<p>聯名具呈</p>

<h3>昨晨已裕輪　突在浦江中沉沒　旅客無羔貨物行李沉失</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民生公司民裕輪，原定前晨起椗駛渝，因裝貨不及，改於昨晨出口。不料昨晨零時左右，突吿進水沉沒，茲將各情探錄於下：</p>
<p>修理甫竣開駛重慶</p>
<p>民裕輪總噸二百三十二噸，係行駛渝宜綫之川江輸，船主寗波人王福成兼大副，船員四十餘人，於十月底應差由渝下駛，在漢口担擱甚久，至十二月初東來，於四日到滬，旋入江南船廠修理，於十九日修竣，移泊五馬路外灘三號碼頭，裝貨搭客，直駛重慶，原定前晨起椗，因手續關係，延至前日始行裝竣，計裝棉紗九十七件，棉布二十一件，柴油八十桶，機器油一百聽，連貨共四百六十四件，合六十餘噸。照該輪容量，尙少裝百分之十五，故載脚不重，乘客亦僅六十五人，貨物於七時許裝齊，乘客亦於九時登船，船員均已休息。</p>
<p>右舷傾側立時下沉</p>
<p>至午夜十二時左右，船身向右舷傾側，潮水遂於後梢纜洞侵入，立時流入貨艙時後貨艙上睡有乘客，見狀驚駭，齊聲大呼，船員得訊，紛紛搶救，用桶汲水傾出，惟進多出少，一時無法挹注，秩序大亂，乘客乃於紛亂中登陸，潮水洶湧，由後梢艙而入機艙，霎時前艙同樣入水，船員亦均上岸，目覩該輪下沉，的一刻鐘全船入水，僅船頂與烟囪留出水面，所裝貨物行李，全部沉沒，幸未傷人。</p>

<h3>日僑管理處　召開婦女座談會　檢討自覺運動的種種</h3>
<p>— 邁天</p>
<p>昨日上午十時，日僑管理處，在狄斯威路該處禮堂，舉行了一個日本婦女座談會。到有日本的智識領袖婦女十數位並特招待本市婦女界代表及記者二十餘人參加。</p>
<p>座談會討論的題目是：「日本婦女自覺運動」，處長王光漢先生說：「時代在前進，要求達到男女平等是必需的一件事，但如何可以達到眞正的男女平等，諸位今天可以盡量的互相商討。」</p>
<p>日本男女均須解放</p>
<p>婦女座談會是由一位日本男子總田來開始的，他的意見是，關於日本解放，不但女子要解放，男子也要解放。他認爲解放應從兩個原則着手。第一，人類的解放，第二，婦女要由男性來解放。因爲現在社會上，政治上，男士們有種種優先權，所以必須由男士給女子以參加之權利，並主要先從男士如何壓迫女子講起。山岸多嘉子女士接着發表了她的宏論，她說她自己倒並未受過男子的壓迫，不過却受到家庭的壓迫。她覺得婦女們離開家庭，和農人們到城市去幹工業是一樣的道理。現在世界各國都有此現象，日本婦女也不應該後落　「跟着，稅田夫人，發表她的高見。她認爲（一）日本婦女對參加政治太不關心。（二）女子的見解和男子有不同之處，參政後是否會影響國事，也値得考慮，所以她希望，今後的日本婦女，一方面要自己修養研究學識，對國內外的事都要認識淸楚，才能參政，一方面要求國家對男女無不平之偏心。</p>
<p>一切不幸自負其責</p>
<p>德田先生又起來補充了一番，講述日本婦女運動的歷史。旋由地方法院黃達平女士起立，他說國家是每個國民的，女子也當負有責任。而女子愛好和平的心比男子要濃厚。對一切權利。不可放棄。</p>
<p>山岸女士立刻又挑　起來，她說日木之所以造成現在一切的不幸，日本應該自負其責的。不過，如果說到女子愛好和平的心比男子强，那似乎有些不合事實。另一位留學過美國的日本女靑年會總幹事內藤孝，她覺得應當把婦女問題當作義務看。</p>
<p>勸告日本婦女兩點</p>
<p>山岸女士說畢，三靑團女靑年組主任莊可襯女士，即起立解釋證明女子怎樣愛好和平。她最後勸吿日本婦女二點：第一，以後要向强不息，革除奴隸性。第二，回去敎育國民，改良過去的侵略敎育。山岸至此，祗得表示代表日本婦女，向中國婦女謝罪，並接受意見。其他還有敎育局代表上官瑜女士，及婦女月刊社濮大公女士，也接着莊女士的意思，向日本婦女，作一番忠吿而散會。</p>
<p>對于中國認識不多</p>
<p>飯后，日僑管理處還招待中國婦女代表及記者，往吳淞去和花園部隊的日本女兵作一次座談會。從各人的談話中，得到一個結論：她們都認爲對中國認識不多。她們都希望能常住中國。她們回去要吿訴她們的姊妹們，中國和中國人的種種好處。</p>
<p>可是，我們不要忘記，日本雖然是打敗了，他們的民族性和所受的侵略敎育，一點也沒有改變。他們依舊是危險的東西。有一個女兵問我們，爲什麼中國的無知識女人和她們倒很親密，而受過高等敎育的女子卻對她們冷淡呢？可見她們所受的薰陶是怎麼樣，他們和她們是　的一自覺」了嗎？</p>
<p>自從日木投降以來，日本婦女已漸能由統傳的壓迫中抬頭。本埠日僑管理處，鑒於婦女問題之重大，特於昨日召開日本婦女座談會，日籍智識領袖婦女，和本市婦女界代表等有多人參加，意義殊爲重要。</p>

<h3>新生的電影與戲劇</h3>
<p>— 靈</p>
<p>八年來淪陷區在敵僞勢力支配下的電影製片機構，以及一部份受着它所影響的戲劇演出，現在都隨着敵人的降伏而消滅了。展開在我們面前的，是一塊空闊的曠地，以及多少破殘的道具。一切都等着我們去改造和創建，使得已經死去的影劇生命，重新隊醒回來。</p>
<p>我們需要電影和戲劇，可是要新生的。要跟得着這個大時代的。我們不但不以粉碎了敵僞的竊奪為已足，同時選要揚　了那些落伍和　化的蠹蟲。</p>
<p>新生的「電影與戲劇」的建立，稅起來眞是頭緒萬端，不是片楮隻字所可完篇的。所以我們決定不怕繁難，從頭做起。申報從本週起，開出這一塊寶貴的園地給與我們——給與所有愛好影劇的大衆，讓我們大家作為扶植新生影劇的園藝試騐塲。我們希望能以期待新生影劇的完成的熱烈情緒來扶育這塊園地。</p>
<p>新生的「電影與戲劇」，不久就要成為讀者們的知友。我們每逢星期日見面一次。</p>
<h3>「前程萬里」前奏曲</h3>
<p>— 吉士</p>
<p>「前程萬里」是太平洋戰事發生期中產生的名貴作品，是中央電影攝影場攝製的一部抗戰巨獻。銀幕展開出來的是一羣逗留在南國的靑年，他們窮得難維生活。什麼也沒有，有的祗是一股愛國的熱忱和集團的火力。他們和環境撲鬥，他們都在追尋光明的路綫。於是，我們的女主角出現了。她出現在暗淡的街燈下，這樣一個悽艷絕代的南國佳人，她的境遇是像薄命的紅顏一般。她的美滿家庭早給暴日的砲火打成粉碎，她洗落在南國中，她變成被迫害的妓女，終日以淚洗面。她脫逃了，得到了這班窮靑年的拯救跳出了魔窟。然而畸形的社會又使她走上了歪曲的路錢，她走上了歌舞台上，天生的麗材和雋材使她成爲一顆歌舞明星大，導演迫得她的衣裳越穿越少，她不得不拂袖求去，加入在「赴前錢」的「萬里前程」去</p>
<p>男主角李淸和女主角容小意的萍水相逢是血和淚寫成的一首抒情詩，可是在這期間却不尋出『我愛你』式的肉麻演出，有的祇是肉眼看不到的心許默會而已</p>
<p>在這個充滿着悲壯氣氛的影片中，却是時時添加發鬆的幽默笑料，和天眞的滑稽素料，功績最大的是李派滑稽李景波，和不滿三尺高的童星容融，觀衆和他見過面之後都會喜歡他們的。</p>
<p>片中到處暴露着黑暗社會的內幕，這是導演蔡楚生的拿手傑作，看過「漁光曲」，「迷途的羔羊」等片的，都同樣會喜歡這部片子。囚爲它不但自由地發揮他的抗戰意識，同時還保存着蔡家老店的「楚生」氣息，你們準可以從銀幕上嗅得出來的。</p>
<p>最後，我們不要忽略了本片的各種，對照性的交洗作風，如嚴肅中的輕快，悲壯中的滑稽，緊張中的歌舞，國語中的擊語，和黑暗中的光明等等，表現出本片是一部包羅萬象的精華巨構。揷曲三支，爲「前程萬里主題歌」，「八百壯士歌」和容小意唱的感懷歌。</p>
<p>該片已內定元旦起在上海公映，我們請拭目以俟罷！</p>
<h3>前程萬里一鏡頭李清主演</h3>
<p>劇評</p>
<h3>關于「夜店」</h3>
<p>— 邵子傑</p>
<p>說實話，我得承認「夜店」是個够水準的戲，貫穿全劇的是人類中的渣滓的生活，他們全太苦，社會把他們打進了地獄，他們不是不知道愛，不知道恨，相反地他們確也曾懷過希望，願意犧牲，然而現實却使他們自私地相爭。誠如編者說：「這不是故事，這是個社會。」滲透在「夜店」中的確是活生生的現實，是下層社會的善良的靈魂。</p>
<p>通過了劇作者的改編。「夜店」的人物，性格，氣氛確已國化得多，然而遺憾的我得懷疑「夜店」會不會不適合我們這地方，「夜店」中的人物我們確常見，然而夜店這下層社會生活的集合處，至少在中國並不多觀。</p>
<p>「夜店」是暴露性的，正因爲這樣我們才赤裸裸地看見了他們的笑，同時也聽得了他們的哭，然而除此之外我不信「夜店」會帶給觀衆更好的指示，「夜店」暴露了地獄的生活，然而却沒有吿訴我們爲甚麼他們要生活得這樣可憐，誠如師陀先生說夜店旣是社會的一角，那末可憾的夜店爲什麼僅似獨立性的社會。失去了「夜店」的社會與造成「夜店」社會的聯緊，以致「夜店」帶給我們的僅是模糊的印影。</p>
<p>嚴格地說「夜店」的劇情似太沉悶且單調，高潮處也不够緊張。丹尼的塞觀音雖表演得尙佳，然台詞太快欠淸潔，張伐的楊七郎流氓氣太輕，丁山的聞太師陰險得很確當。</p>

<h3>夢裏征魂</h3>
<p>— 黃華</p>
<p>Passsage　to　Marseille</p>
<p>（南京映）</p>
<p>這是華納公司的戰時出品，劇情的大部份發生在一艘航行在大西洋上的法國輪船上。自由法國和維希僞政權是本劇的主要鬥爭點。由政治爭執的發展而爆發爲海空大戰，砲火氣息極爲濃厚，尤其在幾位名角合作演出下更見爐火純靑。劇烈處簡直如火如茶。主角爲漢勃里鮑嘉特Humphrye　Bogart他的演技在這幾年來已經進步到登峯造極的境界，而且榮膺電電影帝的稱號。合演的如克勞特蘭因，和恐怖名角彼得路雷等，都是一時之選。全部運用倒叙法，在飄洗在海面的五個被拯救起來的垂死者叙述起他們每人的過去歷險史，他們全是自由法國的愛國份子。他們和船長都同意改變航程到倫敦去，不再把物資載回馬賽資助敵偽。致和武裝的杜少校發生正面的砲戰，接着又是一幕孤舟戰獨機的緊張高潮。而這些故事却是由在美國航空基地的法隊長叙述出來的可謂極盡倒叙的能事。對於不甚聽懂英語封白的觀衆難免有摸不着頭腦之感。全劇中的女角祇有一個，戀愛的塲面也簡單得很，導演是着重於鬥毆，入獄，和脫獄等幕面的處理。他暴露了維希偽府的殘酷與逆施，反襯出法國愛國民衆的堅强意志。緊張塲面處理的得心應手，宣爲本片導演的特色，而法國之有「自由政府」和「維希僞府」，又和中國的戰時現象相類似，看了之後尤其敎人感嘅系之。至於本片在演出上以及在各方面看來，都不愧爲値得鄭重推薦的一部佳作。</p>

<h3>迎上海</h3>
<p>— 白楊</p>
<p>離開上海八年了，走下飛機一看，上海依然是這樣的繁華，這樣的完整，好像戰爭對它特別另眼相看，並沒給它任何損害，心中不知是喜悅，還是感傷。這個重逢給我的，廣是說不出的那麼一般滋味。</p>
<p>在後方八年了，大部分時間消磨在那個濃務籠罩的陪都。在那裏，一切都是簡單，貧陋，不方便；尤其是劇塲裏，乾脆是簡單到一無所有的程度。在那樣的環境裏，我追隨着許多朋友已經苦無了八年了。回想起來，眞像一個夢呵！</p>
<p>現在回到上海了，我們將有優良的工作環境了。我希望快快認識這多年來在敵僞壓迫下堅守崗位的朋友們，更希望滯留在後方的劇人們快快來到上海，我們前方後方打成一片，一同携手爲我們的劇邇努力！</p>

<p>編者先生：我想您一定會同情我們這樣的人的，在大後方，在東南的各學校裏，都有很多的肺病患者，就盒敝校說，一共就有二十人以上，都急需治療；可是都沒有錢，惟有靜候死神的光臨，我國正需要人才建國，難道眼睜睜的看着這批隨政府輾轉遷徒的忠純靑年，白白地死去嗎？</p>
<p>我想　政府當局不會將靑年遺志的，大槪因爲百廢待舉，沒有顧到這　，在後方的報上，我曾看到參政員X先生，曾建議普遍設立療養院，給學界患病的師生，作合理的治療，可是當時物質條件不够，沒有實行，我想在勝利後的今天，接收的物資山積，提出一部份來購置藥品及醫藥設備，該不會成問題吧！而且敵人的軍醫院很多，移作療養院也很適合，政府這樣做，民衆一定是歡迎，更可以保全了這些未來建國的主力—靑年。</p>
<p>敬愛的編輯先生：這是整個貧病靑年的呼聲，請借貴報一角地，將其披露，我想賢明的政府，定會斟酌情形，採納民意的。</p>

<h3>Marshall and President Chiang Had a Two-Hour Secret Talk in Nanjing, Willing to Expedite the Fulfillment of President Truman's Mission</h3>
<p>They had a two-hour, candid conversation in an extremely cordial atmosphere. Although the weather was unfavorable for flying today, General Marshall still took off from Nanjing Airport at 9:15 AM for Chongqing. Before his departure, he did not make any statement to the twenty reporters in Nanjing. President and Madame Chiang did not travel with General Marshall, but it is expected that they will fly to Chongqing tomorrow to preside over the Political Consultative Conference, which opens on the 25th. Last night, President and Madame Chiang hosted a dinner for General Marshall at the red brick residence on the second floor of the Chinese Army Headquarters. Others invited to attend included US Chargé d'Affaires in China Robertson, Commander-in-Chief of US Forces in China Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army General He Yingqin, Military Advisor to the President and Translator General Shang Zhen, and the mayors of Nanjing and Shanghai.

At the end of the meeting, Madame Chiang invited General Marshall, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, and Chargé d'Affaires Robertson to attend a Christmas banquet at the President's residence in Chongqing. The President broke with tradition by personally welcoming Mr. Marshall at the airport, demonstrating friendship and showing goodwill during the initial talks, indicating that the two were at least in agreement on the initial points of discussion. Mr. Marshall stated that after arriving in Chongqing, he would conduct an in-depth exploration of the complex internal problems of China from all aspects.

After bidding farewell to the guests, the President and Marshal entered the President's study together. The nature and content of the talks were not made public, but the length and confidentiality of the meeting indicate the seriousness of the national affairs discussed between the new ambassador and the head of the Chinese National Government. Before leaving Nanjing, Marshal Marshall declared that he expected to meet with the Communist Party leaders currently in Chongqing, as well as representatives of other parties, to hear their opinions as soon as he arrived in Chongqing. Marshal Marshall made it clear during his short time in China that he would do his best to complete his mission as quickly as possible under the instructions of President Truman. According to weather reports, the Chongqing airport is muddy due to rain.</p>
<h3>Reporters Actively Compete for Interviews</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 22nd] US Special Envoy to China General Marshall flew from Nanjing to Chongqing today. A large contingent of US troops was at the airport, all eager to catch a glimpse of the former US Army Chief of Staff. The number of Chinese reporters waiting at the airport for several days was unprecedented. Twelve foreign reporters, originally scheduled to fly from Nanjing to Chongqing, were delayed because their designated aircraft was temporarily unavailable for some reason and are now waiting for another flight in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Due to the arrival of US Special Envoy to China, Marshal Marshall, to visit President Chiang, a large number of Chinese and foreign reporters have also gathered in this city of stone.

Today, at the Guanghua Gate Airport and in front of the President's Office, the white-hot competition among photographers and special correspondents from various film companies will leave a permanent record of this historically significant moment. Broadcast reporters and news reporters are also closely following, hoping to write a valuable page of this vivid material.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] Beiping Mayor Xiong Bin stated unofficially to reporters that Beiping has a 70% chance of becoming China's future capital. According to the observation of the general public here, if the Northeast is successfully received and Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan are stabilized, then this matter may be realized sooner. It is reported that the United States is also very interested in China moving its political center to Beiping, because after the completion of the new port built by the Japanese in Tianjin, the situation in Beiping and Tianjin is very similar to that of Washington and New York.

The iron pipes of the rainwater pool in the old days were dismantled by the Japanese, and now only more than 30 foreign wells supply water, so only 30% of the city uses tap water.

<h3>Sino-Soviet Negotiations Show Slight Improvement, US Newspaper Claims That the Soviet Union Intends to Expand its Sphere of Influence</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 22nd] Just as US Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Nanjing, the Sino-Soviet negotiations, which had been delayed for more than a month, have shown slight improvement, but have not yet been completed. According to the Beiping Office of the Northeast Security Command, Du Yuming's troops have set off from Jinzhou for Shenyang. However, it is still unknown whether we will enter Shenyang on Christmas or New Year's. Judging from the current situation, it seems more optimistic that the National Army will be transported by US ships to complete a large-scale landing. It is also reported that this move is the result of a meeting between General Marshall and the Chinese Supreme Command. In addition, it is also known that the South Manchurian Railway is more than 2,300 miles long, and disturbances occur from time to time along the line. The Japanese Showa Iron Works in Anshan and the surrounding areas, mines and factories have been closed. The two major chemical smelting furnaces in Shenyang, which were built in Germany, have been removed by the Soviet army, and the three major hydroelectric generators in Jilin have also been moved away. All these heavy industrial equipment are the subject of unresolved disputes between China and the Soviet Union as to which are "spoils of war" and which should be returned to China at the same time as the lost territories. [Reuters, London, 22nd] The Daily Telegraph reported from its Washington correspondent: American diplomats have realized that the Soviet Union intends to expand its sphere of influence to the nine eastern provinces of China, fearing that the Soviet Union will repeat its old tricks of creating autonomy in Azerbaijan in northern Iran and making territorial demands on Turkey in the nine provinces of northeastern China. It is expected that within a few weeks, an autonomous movement will appear in the Soviet-garrisoned areas of the Northeast. When President Truman spoke of the US Far East policy last Saturday, he strongly stated that the Soviet Union should return control of the Northeast to the Chinese Central Government. According to the Cairo Declaration of 1943 by the United Kingdom and the United States, the Potsdam Declaration of July this year by the Soviet Union, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August, the liberation of China, including the return of the Northeast, should be respected. Recent reports from China stated that the difficulty of the Sino-Soviet negotiations stems from the Soviet Union's request to jointly manage all the heavy industry in the Northeast with China. This request is not stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which shows that the Soviet Union does have considerable ambitions for the nine eastern provinces of China.</p>
<h3>Minister Gu Attends the National Political Council, Reports on Social Administration Facilities, Li Zhongxiang and Others Request Relief for Private Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>[Chongqing Central News Agency, 22nd] The Standing Committee of the National Political Council held its 12th meeting yesterday, chaired by Wang Yunwu. After the Secretary and Shao Lizi read the written report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang reported on social administration facilities and the reception of recovered areas. The following resolutions were then passed: (1) A proposal by Councilors Li Zhongxiang, Chen Shaoxian, and Xi Yushu suggesting that the government provide relief to the private shipping industry to cultivate a foundation for shipping was resolved to be submitted to the government for prompt action. (2) A proposal by Councilors Chen Shaoxian, Li Zhongxiang, and He Baoren suggesting that the U.S. has agreed to continue freezing wartime deposits of Chinese citizens in the U.S., and requesting the government to negotiate extraction methods, and levy progressive heavy taxes, allocating all proceeds to improve people's livelihood, in order to crack down on wartime black money and balance social wealth, was resolved to be passed and submitted to the government for action. (3) Councilors Kong Geng, Yin Shuxian, and Wu Zhaoxu, based on a telegram from eight councilors in Peiping, including He Jihong, suggested the following points: A, The government should publicize the content of negotiations with the CCP at any time; B, Urge the government to convene the second plenary session of this council; C, All facilities in the Northeast should be no different from those in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces, and should not be treated as a special zone; D, Establish a list of traitors and arrest them promptly; E, Provide universal relief to North China. It was resolved that, except for the point regarding the convening of the second plenary session of the council, which has already been resolved, the other points should be submitted to the government for consideration. (4) A proposal by Councilors Huang Yanpei, Jiang Yong, Xu Deheng, Li Huang, and Chu Fucheng suggesting methods for dealing with Japanese enemy textile factories was resolved to be submitted to the government for reference.</p>

<h3>Three-Power Talks Frank and Friendly, Misunderstandings Not Entirely Eliminated, Generally Believed Some Agreements Will Be Reached, China and France to Be Notified of Matters Concerning Them</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 22nd] According to well-informed sources close to the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has now reached the "stage of concretion." The three countries seem to be closer to agreement on important international issues than they were at the opening of the conference. Most of the previous suspicions have been dispelled. Although obstacles to understanding international issues have not been entirely eliminated, it is believed that some agreements will be reached.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, along with their closest advisors and experts, held an informal meeting for four and a half hours yesterday. The meeting was extremely satisfactory, so it was decided to suspend formal meetings temporarily and continue informal meetings this afternoon. Authoritative sources say that these informal talks allow participants greater freedom of speech, thus enabling the scope of the talks to be broadened. All parties are still keeping silent about the content of the talks. It is also learned that U.S. Ambassador Harriman met with Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Fu Bingchang yesterday, and it is said that both ambassadors were informed of all matters directly related to China and France.</p>
<p>Smooth Progress in Talks on Controlling Atomic Energy</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources in London: The three powers are making smooth progress in talks on atomic energy. The Soviet Union realizes that it may not be able to co-chair the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission with Britain and the United States at the UN General Assembly in January next year, based on the recommendations of the Washington atomic talks, but it is expected that the Soviet Union will not oppose this recommendation, and may still become a member of the commission. It is generally believed that if the Atomic Energy Commission proposed by Bevin and Byrnes to Molotov is established, it will be responsible to the Security Council composed of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and six other countries on the control of the manufacture of atomic bombs and the scope of use of atomic bombs for the purpose of maintaining peace, and will be responsible to the UN General Assembly on the scope of developing atomic energy for industrial use. Judging from current trends, Bevin and Byrnes may spend Christmas in Moscow.</p>
<p>Soviet Press Launches Systematic Offensive Against Britain and the United States</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The Soviet press has launched a systematic offensive against the policies of Britain and the United States. The events being attacked are almost all within the agenda of the Three-Power Conference. "Pravda" led the attack on the presence of British troops in Greece, Egypt, Indonesia, and other foreign countries. This is a counterattack, because Iran has repeatedly requested the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran, so the Soviet Union rebuts why Britain and the United States still have troops stationed in friendly countries after the end of the war. The issue of troop withdrawal is a comprehensive issue and cannot be discussed solely on the basis of the withdrawal of troops from Iran. The British and American view is that the presence of Allied troops in Iran is based on the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty, so the issue of resolving the withdrawal of troops from Iran cannot be separated from that treaty. According to a telegram from the interior of Iran, the current crisis is expected to be resolved through direct negotiations between Tehran and Tabriz. Since the three powers have reached a stalemate due to the Iranian issue, the aforementioned method may also be considered. Another editorial in "Pravda" discussed the issue of the U.S. military's stay in China. Recent commentaries in other Soviet newspapers have also touched on the Japanese issue, so it is expected that the Soviet representative will firmly demand joint control of Japan and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China when the Moscow conference discusses Far Eastern issues. There is no indication whether the Turkish issue will be raised in the Moscow conference. If the issue of the Dardanelles is discussed, the position of the British and American foreign ministers will definitely still be based on the notes that the two governments previously submitted to the Turkish government.</p>
<h3>Competition for Spheres of Influence by Great Powers Shifts from Eastern Europe to West Asia, British Empire's Lifeline Feels Threatened, Crisis of Future Just Beginning</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The New York Times correspondent reports that the competition for spheres of influence by great powers has shifted from Eastern Europe to West Asia. This phenomenon is not surprising, but it is difficult to absolve Britain and the United States of negligence for failing to take precautions. Since the Soviet Union formally requested the revision of the Montreux Convention in February, the crisis in the Middle East has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and the occurrence of the following three events coincides with the development of this crisis: (1) The holding of elections in the surrounding countries of Eastern Europe and the establishment of pro-Soviet regimes in countries such as South Bao have finally led to the establishment of the protection zone that the Soviet Union has dreamed of for a long time. (2) The withdrawal of foreign troops from Iran is approaching, and action should be taken as soon as possible if there is action. (3) The reopening of negotiations by the Allies has become increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union deeply knows that it is easier to protect an accomplished fact than to demand the right to act in the future, so at the beginning of the Three-Power Conference in Moscow, the Soviet Union had already completed the deployment of an accomplished fact. Regarding the Iranian issue, two phenomena have emerged, one is the competition among the three powers, and the other is the competition between new and old social systems, and these two have a close relationship with each other. From the perspective of Britain and the United States, rather than protecting Iran's social and administrative system, it is better to directly attack Soviet interference, so that Britain and the United States themselves can also take decisive action. Although Iran urgently needs rural and social reforms, the influence of Britain and the United States in Tehran has not been able to make significant achievements in this regard, while the Soviet Union in northern Iran has been able to gain the support of the lower classes and ethnic minorities through its clever propaganda. What Britain and the United States do not understand is why the Soviet Union maintains a large number of troops in northern Iran, and has even increased its troops before the Azerbaijan incident occurred. The Soviet Union's ambitions in the Middle East can be said to be not small. In addition to hoping to obtain a base in the Dardanelles, Moscow also intends to obtain a part of Turkish Armenia in order to establish a more pro-Soviet government. In Iran, the Soviet Union hopes to obtain oil and other concessions, and intends to obtain routes to the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Aden to obtain warm-water ports in the Indian Ocean. The Soviet Union's development plan not only threatens the lifeline of the British Empire, but also hinders the oil rights of the United States in Saudi Arabia, so the Iranian issue has become the focus of the dispute among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Britain has hastily signed the Levant Agreement with France to repair its rupture in Lebanon, but the Palestinian issue is still a thorny one, and the Soviet Union can also secretly instigate it. The solution to the Iranian issue seems to be inevitably beneficial to the Soviet Union, but Britain will inevitably suffer a blow as a result. If Azerbaijan and the Soviet Union become a de facto merger, Turkey will be surrounded and Iraq will be threatened. In short, the Soviet Union has gained the upper hand in the current development of the situation in the Middle East, but the crisis of the future is just beginning.</p>
<h3>Turkey Willing to Reconcile with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 22nd] Turkish Foreign Minister Saka declared in the National Assembly yesterday: Although the Soviet Union has not renewed the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression with Turkey, it does not affect Turkey's desire to reconcile with the Soviet Union. Turkey's goal is to maintain peace internally and externally. We have continued and will continue to follow a consistent policy in the past and in the future, that is, we do not seek from others, nor do we give to others. We are still prepared to promote friendly relations with the Soviet Union. We will maintain this hope in order to achieve our goal. General Kara Beikir said that if the reports in the foreign press are true, then our northern neighbor seems to intend to make demands on me. The world should know that the straits are the throat of Turkey, and the Kars Plateau is the trunk of Turkey. I hope that this neighbor can maintain friendship with me, otherwise it will inevitably be detrimental to both parties. The province of Kars is located in eastern Turkey and was obtained from Russia after the last world war.</p>
<h3>British Concerns About East Indies Issue, Dutch Prime Minister to Visit Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Sources predict that when Prime Minister Attlee meets with Dutch Prime Minister Schermerhorn and Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook next week, he will tell them that Britain is deeply willing to order British troops to withdraw from Indonesia immediately after the safety of expatriates is guaranteed. Britain also hopes that Dutch leaders will contact Indonesian leaders to reach an agreement. The Dutch Prime Minister is expected to lead Van Mook and Colonial Minister Logemann to London on the 26th. Prime Minister Attlee is prepared to shorten the Christmas holiday and meet with them in advance. Britain's position is that British troops cannot remain in Indonesia for a long time. Although Britain has a responsibility to the Netherlands, it cannot use British troops as a tool to force Indonesians to accept Dutch will. The most important point is to maintain local order so that negotiations can proceed smoothly. London political figures deeply understand the background of the Indonesian issue, but at the same time believe that the widespread popular movement that has occurred in Indonesia cannot be ignored. Although Britain cannot determine the date of withdrawal, Britain should declare its intention to maintain order, conditional on the parties concerned promoting negotiations as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Dempsey Leaves Java, British Parachute Troops Sent Out</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Batavia, General Dempsey, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Land Forces in Southeast Asia, and General Buck, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, arrived in Batavia yesterday and left again a few hours later. It is not known what mission they were on.</p>
<p>[TASS, London, 22nd] According to London Radio: The British 5th Parachute Brigade has been fully deployed in the Batavia area.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission Scheduled to Depart for Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st, United Press] The Far Eastern Advisory Commission today listened to Pauley's report on the recent situation in Japan, and a summary of the report by Head of the Civil Affairs Department of the U.S. Army Department Hydringer to General MacArthur on educational and economic matters. A spokesman said that the issue of Soviet participation in the Far Eastern Advisory Commission was not mentioned today. The committee announced that MacArthur, Chairman of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, will be the chairman of the delegation to Japan on December 26, and former Ambassador Johnson will be the Secretary-General. The main representatives are Chinese Lieutenant General Zhu Shimin, Philippine Interior Minister Confesor, Indian Saksena, and Sir Sansom, the United Nations representative of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Far East Committee.</p>
<h3>Foundation of New Japan Completed, Existing Feudal Institutions Almost Completely Eradicated, MacArthur Will No Longer Issue Important Directives</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that the foundational work for building a new Japan has been completed, and no further important directives will be issued. The creation of a "caring and harmonious country" will now depend entirely on the ability of the Japanese people to implement reforms based on the directives, and it is hoped that they will quickly complete them. Future directives will be limited to interpretation, so that the Japanese people can understand without confusion and fully comply. [United Press, New York, 21st] In just over a hundred days, MacArthur has eradicated Japan's old feudal institutions and rapidly laid the foundation for the establishment of a new democratic system in Japan. The Supreme Commander has issued a series of orders to achieve this goal, some of which have been so severe that even observers in Tokyo fear they will be openly resisted, but the Japanese people have adopted a completely obedient attitude to every order. With each directive that MacArthur issues, his prestige not only does not diminish, but also increases day by day.</p>
<h3>Two British Brigades to Participate in the Occupation of Japan Within a Month</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 22nd] Admiral Fraser, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, said that two British brigades are expected to land at the Wu naval port within a month to participate in the occupation of Japan. The operation of the Wu naval port will be the responsibility of the British Navy, and the land commander will be an Australian, commanding one brigade of Australian troops, one brigade of British Indian troops, and a New Zealand air force unit.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 22nd] Admiral Fraser said that Hong Kong will re-establish its pre-war strength as a naval base and fleet forward command post.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Oppose Soviet Expansion of Joint Control of Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 21st] The Howard newspapers wrote an editorial saying, "It is rumored that the Soviet Union is in the Moscow conference, fighting MacArthur for a large part of the authority to manage Japan." The editorial strongly opposed this point. The article said, "We do not believe that our government will agree to this. This approach will encourage the Japanese people to take advantage of their legacy, and will be similar to the chaos caused by the Soviet Union in occupied Germany. The division of power management system in Berlin is extremely unwise, and the result is only frustrating."</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Plans to Reorganize Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] According to Kyodo News Agency: The Japanese government plans to reorganize the administrative structure, abolish the Ministry of Health and Welfare, add a Ministry of Public Works, disband the Information Bureau, and establish the Prime Minister's Office, with a Minister without Portfolio as the head of the office.</p>
<h3>American General Patton Dies Suddenly, U.S. Troops in German Occupation Zone Lower Flags in Mourning, Remains to Be Buried on European Battlefield</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 22nd, Special Dispatch] Marshal MacArthur expressed infinite condolences for the sudden death of General Patton. It is said that General Patton was a brave and heroic soldier, and his great personality and unwavering determination will last forever. The American soldiers in the Pacific will surely mourn his sudden passing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Heidelberg, 21st] General Patton died peacefully in his sleep due to a blood clot in his lungs causing gangrene, leading to heart failure. According to a public statement issued by Major General Waylen, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Seventh Army, General Patton passed away peacefully at 17:50 on the 21st. Mrs. Patton flew to Heidelberg after her husband was injured in a car accident earlier this month. His wife was by his side when he died. It has been decided that the General's remains will be buried in a place on the route taken by the American troops when they drove into Germany, most likely within Luxembourg. General Patton died twelve days after he was injured in a car accident. The American occupation zone in Germany was ordered to fly flags at half-staff in mourning.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the U.S.-Japan War, The Course of Peace Mediation, As Described in Konoe's Memoirs</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] According to Burton Crane, a correspondent for the New York Times: The Asahi Shimbun is publishing Konoe's memoirs in daily installments. One section states that in May 1941, the Japanese cabinet, with the consent of the army and navy, had agreed to accept the U.S. request to withdraw Japanese troops from China. It is claimed that one section of the memoirs that has already been published proves that the Japanese side understood that the adventure in China had completely failed and had greatly weakened Japan. When the Japanese cabinet accepted the U.S. proposal, both sides stipulated that the peace in all aspects of China should not be publicized, so as to avoid the Japanese side losing face excessively. The conditions agreed to by the Japanese side at that time included the following:</p>
<p>(1) Chinese independence;</p>
<p>(2) Withdrawal of Japanese troops from China;</p>
<p>(3) No annexation of Chinese territory;</p>
<p>(4) No compensation for losses;</p>
<p>(5) Restoration of the Open Door Policy;</p>
<p>(6) Merger of Chiang Kai-shek's government and Wang Jingwei's "government";</p>
<p>(7) Restriction of large-scale Japanese migration to China;</p>
<p>(8) Recognition of "Manchukuo." As for why this surprising Japanese liberal stance failed to result in an agreement, the details will be revealed when the Asahi Shimbun continues to publish its installments. According to Konoe's memoirs (which were written two weeks before Konoe committed suicide), the basis for the U.S.-Japan peace negotiations was laid down in December 1940. At that time, private American individuals, including Catholic Bishop Byrne, also participated. Progress was made, and the Japanese side submitted a preliminary plan to U.S. Secretary of State Hull on April 8, 1941. The U.S. side replied to the Japanese government on the 17th and 18th of the same month. At that time, the U.S. government requested an immediate meeting. Former Foreign Minister Matsuoka was suffering from a serious illness, but he still made major modifications to the U.S. proposal. The proposal was then submitted to a meeting held on May 3. At that time, except for Matsuoka, everyone advocated sending the modified plan to the U.S. side immediately, but Matsuoka insisted that Japan and the U.S. must first conclude a neutrality treaty, and advocated notifying Germany of the progress of this matter first. The cabinet opposed it, but Matsuoka ultimately prevailed. This matter was completely under his control. Matsuoka then sent two instructions to Japanese Ambassador Nomura. One of them was a letter to Hull, stating that Germany and Italy had absolute confidence in victory, and that U.S. participation would only prolong the war and destroy civilization. The letter also emphasized that the Japanese side could not take any action that would betray its allies. The other instruction instructed Nomura to declare that the neutrality treaty was the will of the Emperor.</p>
<p>On May 4, Matsuoka informed the Axis envoys stationed in Tokyo of what was happening in "absolute secrecy." As a result, Matsuoka's plan did not succeed, and the situation in the United States also changed due to the development of defense plans and the convoy incident.</p>
<h3>At the Request of the United States, Britain Makes Concessions to Siam, Withdrawing Some Harsh Demands</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Reliable sources from Bangkok report today that, due to pressure from the United States, Britain has retracted many of its most stringent demands on Siam. Siamese Prime Minister Phra Phimonrat stated, "The Siamese people are particularly grateful to the United States, as that nation was willing to step forward to assist us in our time of difficulty." As news from Bangkok spread, rumors circulated in Washington, with some believing that the British government had abandoned most of its demands, with the exception of rice. Other well-informed sources stated that London was still demanding that Siam compensate for all damages caused to British property by Japanese and Allied air raids, and that in addition to rice compensation, Britain was also demanding that Siam bear the costs of Allied occupation forces. According to these sources, the Siamese government had offered either rice compensation or payment of air raid damages and occupation costs, but fulfilling both would bankrupt the country.</p>
<h3>Proposal within the US to Convert Hawaii into a State</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] Secretary of the Interior Ickes today proposed to Congress that Hawaii be converted into a state of the United States.</p>
<h3>Prince Nashimoto and Several Others to be Released Soon</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 22nd] According to responsible sources, Prince Nashimoto and several other war crimes suspects detained in Sugamo Prison will soon be released. According to US Chief Prosecutor Keenan, those war crimes suspects for whom there is insufficient evidence will naturally be released.</p>
<h3>Strengthen the United Nations Organization to Make it a World Government; Bevin Delivers Speech; Preparatory Committee's Work Concludes</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 22nd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin last night addressed the leaders of the delegations to the Preparatory Committee, stating that the United Nations organization must become a world government, or it will be a mere formality. He also called for the immediate establishment of a strong regional United Nations organization in Europe. He stated, "At this time, we must aim high; a light approach is insufficient to solve major problems. I believe the United Nations organization must truly become a world government, and its new headquarters in the United States must become the political capital of the world." Bevin delivered this speech as the Preparatory Committee was drawing to a close and is expected to conclude by Sunday. The representatives of the fifty-one nations will reconvene at the first formal meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on January 10th next year.</p>
<p>Review of the Work of the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The Preparatory Committee has effectively concluded its work. The work of the Administrative and Budgetary subcommittees will likely continue until the weekend, but other major issues have been resolved. Overall, the process has been satisfactory. The major issues discussed by the Preparatory Committee include:</p>
<p>(1) The location of the United Nations headquarters was decided to be in the United States. A subcommittee will select five cities from those competing in the United States, and the General Assembly will make the final decision. (2) It was decided not to establish a temporary trusteeship committee. Administering nations should be responsible for transitioning mandates to trusteeships. The drafted agreements should be submitted to the initial meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and the trusteeship agreements should be reviewed by the General Assembly's Trusteeship Committee. (3) The General Assembly should establish a General Committee to carry out guiding tasks. Its organization and powers have been agreed upon. (4) The relationship with various specialized agencies, such as the International Labour Organization, will be discussed by the General Assembly. From this perspective, the Preparatory Committee has resolved three of the four major issues left over by the Executive Committee. Only the issue of specialized agencies could not be resolved by the Preparatory Committee. Judging from the situation at this meeting of the Preparatory Committee, all representatives are willing to accept the opinion of the majority, which is a good sign for the future of the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>Nations Form Regional Groups</p>
<p>However, during the voting process, representatives of various countries seem to have a tendency to form regional groups. The group formed by the representatives of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia is the most closely knit. The group led by the United States, consisting of representatives from various South American countries, is more loosely organized. Britain, along with its Dominions and Western European countries, has also formed a group. As for the Chinese representatives, they often like to propose compromise solutions when conflicting opinions arise. In conclusion, the results of the work of the United Nations Preparatory Committee are quite encouraging. However, the phenomenon of representatives of various countries forming groups seems somewhat inappropriate. Furthermore, the holding of the Moscow Conference effectively determines the tasks of the United Nations organization through the relations of powerful nations outside the United Nations organization, which is nothing less than a re-enactment of power politics, which is truly not suitable for the post-war world.</p>
<p>Residents of Trust Territories Allowed to Speak</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] After a three-session debate, the Technical Subcommittee of the United Nations Preparatory Committee has passed the Ukrainian representative's proposal to amend a procedural rule of the Trusteeship Council, granting the Trusteeship Council the power to use various different methods to ensure that the people of the trust territories have the opportunity to fully express their opinions. For example, if a representative body exists, it should be allowed to express its views, hold open elections of spokespersons, consult with local national organizations, hold general elections, and the Trusteeship Council should send special representatives to directly contact the people of the trust territories, etc.</p>
<h3>United Nations Headquarters Decided to be in the Eastern United States</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 22nd] The United Nations Preparatory Committee voted today to establish the permanent headquarters of the United Nations organization in the eastern United States, excluding San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached Between Britain and France on the Withdrawal of Troops from Lebanon and Syria</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The agreement between Britain and France regarding the withdrawal of British and French troops from the territory of Livent (i.e., Syria and Lebanon), published yesterday, stipulates that the United Nations organization will make the final decision on the security of the Livent region. Before the United Nations organization takes over, Britain and France will retain an appropriate number of troops in the area to ensure its security. The withdrawal of British and French troops will be completed simultaneously. The British and French governments further guarantee that they will not engage in any actions in the Middle East region that would harm the interests or responsibilities of the other party. According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, it is not possible to discern from this agreement when the United Nations organization will be able to decide on the security guarantee arrangements for the Livent region, or what form these arrangements will take.</p>
<h3>The Emperor and Imperial Family Will Also Be Required to Pay Taxes Hereafter</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 22nd] Emperor Hirohito and all members of the Imperial Family will henceforth be subject to tax obligations. The first type is the war profits tax. This matter was decided yesterday by the Imperial Household Ministry and the Ministry of Finance. Imperial property, which has not been taxed in the past, will also be examined hereafter so that taxes will be paid in the same way as ordinary people.</p>
<h3>Philippine Bar Association to Try Hirohito</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] The American Bar Association today published a letter from the Philippine Bar Association to President Truman, requesting that Emperor Hirohito be tried for war crimes.</p>
<h3>Over 80,000 Japanese Plead for Yamashita's Clemency; He Requests Seppuku</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Tokyo, 22nd] A spokesperson for General MacArthur stated that US Secretary of the Army Patterson, in accordance with the will of the Supreme Court, has ordered Yamashita Tomoyuki's lawyers to fly to Washington, but the number of lawyers is limited to three, and the time is to be determined by them. They can request the court to issue a writ of habeas corpus and a stay of execution pending appeal, either in simple written form or orally. Today, 86,000 Japanese people petitioned MacArthur to reduce Yamashita's sentence to life imprisonment or allow him to commit seppuku.</p>

It is reported that the county government has ordered the district chiefs to investigate the firearms held by the residents of their respective townships and towns within a specified time limit, conduct registration and report in accordance with the established provisional measures, and complete the filing within ten days to avoid prosecution.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>County Construction Committee Inspects Seawall</p>
<p>The seawalls along the river in this area have been neglected for years, and most have been damaged. Pang Diancai, a member of the County Construction Committee, and technical personnel from the county government went to Hupu and Xuliu Jingkou on the 19th to inspect, draw detailed maps, and prepare a restoration plan, which will be submitted to the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for the allocation of construction materials to carry out the repairs.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Direct Tax Sub-Bureaus Established in Various Jiangsu Counties</p>
<p>Shi Shouchang, the Director of the Jiangsu Direct Tax Bureau, upon receiving his appointment from the Ministry of Finance, led over a hundred tax officials from Xi'an to Jiangsu and established an office in Shanghai. Because there were not enough personnel to be assigned, a training class for 300 senior and junior tax personnel was established at Shanghai Jiaotong University on the first of this month. Upon completion of the training on the 24th, a graduation ceremony will be held, and then they will be assigned to serve in various county bureaus. Sub-bureaus have been established in nine counties, including Tongshan, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Songjiang, and Nantong. The establishment of sub-bureaus in other counties, such as Changshu, is temporarily suspended.</p>

<p>Emergency Repairs to Jiangsu Highway Trunk and Branch Lines</p>
<p>The War Transport Bureau is extremely concerned about highway transportation in various provinces, and pays particular attention to the highways in Jiangsu Province. Chairman Wang once telegraphed the Central Government to allocate funds for repairs. Gong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications and Deputy Director-General of the War Transport Bureau, inspected the Nanjing-Shanghai area and appointed Shen Laiyi, a specialist commissioner of the Bureau and concurrently Director of the Jiangsu Highway Bureau, to be responsible for the emergency repairs to the Wuhu section of the Nanjing-Shanghai Highway. Upon receiving the order, Shen led more than 20 engineers and hundreds of bridge repair workers to deploy the repairs in sections along the Wuhu section, and sent Chief Engineer Chen Chao to Wuxi to supervise the work, with a deadline of completing the repairs within the year. Preparations are also being made for the emergency repairs to the Beijing-Wuhan section, with the goal of opening the entire Beijing-Shanghai line in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Mutiny and Looting by Garrison Troops in the Town</p>
<p>Dayun Temple Town (in Jiaxing County), located at the junction of Jiaxing and Jiashan, is an important town in the eastern countryside, so it has a garrison stationed there. Yesterday (the 20th), it was learned here that the garrison stationed there suddenly mutinied on the 19th and looted the town before fleeing east. Areas such as Rudong and Xincang were also looted along the way.</p>

<h3>Mourning General "Blood and Guts": Patton's Heroic Spirit Lives On! - This Newspaper Archives</h3>
<p>General Patton, the commander of the Third Army who was the first American to enter German territory, has finally died in Heidelberg from lung injuries sustained in a car accident! This is a great loss.</p>
<p>MacArthur said sorrowfully in his telegram of condolence: "General Patton died in a state of great beauty, giving me the deepest sorrow. He was a brave and dashing military strategist. The entire Pacific force must mourn him." I now translate the simple and powerful eulogy above from the telegram sent from MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo. I imagine that our entire army and people who once fought alongside General Patton will feel deep sorrow and even lower our heads to mourn him and shed tears for him when we hear this tragic news!</p>
<p>Patton's Background</p>
<p>General Patton was from California, USA, and would have been 60 years old this year. In his youth, he excelled in marksmanship and was also a track and field athlete. He attended the World Games held in Stockholm, Sweden, and showed his talent and great skill.</p>
<p>He was admired for his heroic appearance as a tank warfare expert. He founded the first tank school. He led a tank brigade to attack the German army and established great military exploits.</p>
<p>Well said, MacArthur! When we mourn General Patton, the first thing we must commemorate is his bravery. In winter, he liked to wear a brown leather coat and sit in a tank to lead his troops and command the battle. He most admired the spirit of "leading by example" and "supervising the battle in person." His motto was what he often said to his subordinates, and it was not just talk, but he practiced it himself. Listen to what he said:</p>
<p>"Advance, keep advancing! Even when the last bullet and the last drop of gasoline are used up, you must still run forward!"</p>
<p>Brief History of the Expedition</p>
<p>In the First European War, General Patton was promoted from the rank of captain to colonel due to his outstanding military achievements. He received many medals and served as a staff officer to General Pershing. After the war, he served as a cavalry training officer and regimental commander. When the Second European War broke out, the brave and skilled General Patton was ordered to lead his troops on an expedition. He personally commanded the battles in the theaters of Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, creating many brilliant achievements. In the Sicilian campaign, we will not forget General Patton's bravery. He jumped into the sea from a boat, led his army to land on the other shore, and completed his planned strategy.</p>
<p>A Dashing Soldier</p>
<p>General MacArthur praised General Patton's bravery and skill in battle, which can be clearly demonstrated by this example. As for why we should praise his dashing and romantic nature? Well, there are also examples to cite. General Patton was by no means a simple-minded military man. On the contrary, he was a man of both literary and military talents, or perhaps it would be more appropriate to call him a poet-like military man. In the midst of war, he did not forget to compose poetry, which was one of his special hobbies. He wrote two volumes of poetry, which were known to all walks of life in the United States. Now, has he passed away before seeing its publication? This is regrettable. In addition, his legacy of tank warfare theory is worth introducing.</p>
<p>Direct Assault on German Territory</p>
<p>Last year, when the United States was still at war with Germany, he appeared on the battlefield as the commander of the Third Army. He launched a surprise attack from Normandy, leading his armored units to penetrate France and directly attack the Ardennes region. In other words, he had already broken into the Nazi German positions. This massive offensive dealt a fatal blow to the German army, breaking the enemy general Lundstedt's final counter-offensive plan. At the same time, his Fourth Armored Division took this opportunity to charge into southern Germany from Lunner, penetrating deep into the enemy's territory at a top speed of 80 miles per day. Later, in forty-two days, the pace of the advance became even fiercer, creating a new record of an average of 100 miles per day.</p>
<p>After the defeat of Germany, General Patton served as the commander of the eastern sector of the American occupation zone in Germany, and was later transferred to the commander of the Fifteenth Army, with continued distinction. Now, he is dead. It is said that he will soon be buried in a European cemetery. No, no, he will live in the hearts of all the military and civilians of the United Nations and in our memories.</p>
<h3>London in Mid-Month: A Panoramic View of a New Atmosphere</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Zhu Jiarang</p>
<p>It's just an hour's flight from Paris to London. If you take the train, you have to cross the English Channel, which takes about sixteen hours from start to finish, with half of that time spent on passport checks and other procedures at the Franco-British border. It was my first time taking a train between England and France, and to my surprise, it wasn't much different from those in China. Although I traveled in a first-class overnight train, there were no sleeping berths, so we all just sat through the night, wide awake. We boarded the ship at dawn, seeing white waves rolling endlessly, the sea and sky meeting at the horizon. The turbulent storms of 1940-41 had passed, and it should be a season of gentle breezes and warm sunshine from now on.</p>
<p>Getting off the train at Victoria Station, the famous "Foggy City" was entirely shrouded in a hazy mist. The large and dense buildings were indistinguishable in the dim yellow light. However, the double-decker yellow buses running continuously on the roads, the storefronts, and the traffic lights didn't seem any different to someone used to Shanghai and Hong Kong, because they were all of the same type. The porters and all the public transport workers at London's stations, like in France, were mostly women, but they were sturdier and more powerful than the French ones. I remember getting off the train that day and having to run to keep up with the woman who was carrying our luggage and pushing the cart.</p>
<p>The general "old grandeur" of London is displayed quite fully and universally. The signs of ordinary shops and companies often have "1881" or "1901" written on them, to show their age. The architecture doesn't have the heavily made-up and delicately carved style of Paris, but it is tall and imposing, not inferior in any way. In particular, the exterior is covered in soot and not often cleaned, because that's the record of history. The entire city is vast, and the underground trains reach everywhere, seeming cleaner and more comfortable than in Paris. Just like in Shanghai, there are over a hundred double-decker yellow bus routes running all day long. A female ticket seller jumps up and down the stairs tirelessly, and it would be hard for someone with a weaker constitution to manage. Another symbol of London's "old grandeur" is the style of its taxis, which resemble medieval carriages, and are driven by old men. However, it is quite comfortable to sit inside.</p>
<p>Commemorative Buildings Located in Lively Central Areas</p>
<p>I have been studying London's history for a long time. It really began with the stretch along the Thames River, so that area looks particularly old. The roads are as narrow as Shanghai's Fourth Avenue or Huajinli, and many only allow one-way traffic. Although the buildings are solid, they are not modern at all. The Tower Bridge, which crosses the river, resembles two fortresses. The middle section can be raised and lowered, and it's one of the oldest representatives. Further down the Thames, past the two new Waterloo bridges in London, is the famous Westminster Abbey, a great structure from the eleventh century. A massive rectangular building by the river is the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the mother of world constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Westminster Abbey is as grand as St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, but their moods are different. The former is full of antiquity, while the latter excels in exquisite religious art. Westminster was built in 1050 and used to be where kings were crowned and where sacred ceremonies were held. The architecture has a solemn feel, with its altar, choir, and pipe organ. Although there are many people attending services on Sundays, they only occupy a corner of the huge cathedral. Westerners regard the church as a place for personal cultivation and religious education. Before scientific answers to questions of life and death are confirmed, religion still holds an unshakable force. Westminster is also the final resting place for the greatest figures of all ages. There are marble coffins all around, accompanied by countless statues and inscriptions. This makes it easier for future generations to remember them than burying them in remote mountains and fields, and the method seems worthwhile. In the future, when we in China build tombs for nameless heroes, or any commemorative buildings for famous people, I think we should also move them to lively downtown areas, as that is the only way they will have meaning.</p>
<p>The Great Bastion of British Constitutionalism: Inside the Parliament</p>
<p>The British Parliament is bustling with activity year-round. Since Churchill stepped down and the Labour Party came to power, differences in ideology have led to amendments to legislation, and the atmosphere in the House of Commons feels tense every day, with constant verbal battles. I had the chance to visit once. Inside this bastion of British constitutionalism, there are two parts: the House of Lords and the House of Commons, each with its own meeting hall, library, committee room, offices, as well as restaurants and tea rooms. The tall, massive clock tower strikes clear and skilled symphonic notes, reporting Greenwich Mean Time, which is broadcast worldwide every day. The wide waters of the Thames River flow silently beneath it, like a running ledger quietly recording the honors and riches of the British Empire, as well as its hardships and subsequent recovery. The great power of the Parliament now resides in the House of Commons. All the government's measures must be subject to the review and questioning of the people's representatives. Britain values freedom, and even any Tom, Dick, or Harry can express themselves freely in Hyde Park, so it is naturally even more the responsibility of parliamentarians to speak their minds freely in Parliament. Therefore, there are many questions every day. Meetings are held every week from Monday to Friday, starting at 2 PM and lasting until 9 or 10 PM. Members of Parliament eat and drink inside. Last week, some people even missed their train because it was so late, so they slept in Parliament. On average, they spend seven or eight hours a day in meetings, and the British are indeed quite capable of holding meetings. But what does their meeting place look like? Is it grand? If you have high hopes, you will be greatly disappointed. This place where important policies are discussed and the struggles of head figures occur, is about the size of the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters in Chongqing, except for small balconies around it for journalists and observers. The facilities in the meeting hall are not very elaborate. Members of Parliament sit facing each other, with the government party on the right and the opposition party on the left, in rows of long leather-cushioned chairs. Everyone sits casually, and there are no tables for reading or writing in front of them, which must be said to be simple. However, it is said that it has been passed down from ancient times, and so they have simply "conserved" it. During the meeting time, except for reports from the Prime Minister or cabinet members, all the time is spent on questioning, debating, and passing bills. There are as many questions as hairs on an ox, and any kind of question can be raised. I remember that when I visited the other day, one of the more than two hundred questions asked whether the government's stationery used in a certain period compared with that taken from the government stationery supply department. From this, it can be seen that it is not easy to be a cabinet minister in Britain. First, you have to be a thorough expert who can always cite figures. Second, you have to have a special level of cultivation, otherwise you cannot afford to lose your temper. The demeanor of the parliamentarians in the hall seems more lively than in our parliament. When I walked in that day, I heard laughter naturally, it was not "solemn." To second what someone else said, you don't even need to raise your hand, you can just say "Yes" repeatedly. Some people even put their feet on the chairs, but every time they enter or leave, they bow to the chairman's seat on the spot, showing politeness.</p>
<p>A 180-Degree Turn: The Tumultuous Political Situation of the British Government</p>
<p>Today's political situation in Britain has been reported by the Central News Agency, so there is no need for me to dwell on it. But in describing the British Parliament, it is impossible not to mention that after the war, this country's major policies have been moving in the direction of socialism. However, due to the current economic difficulties and scarcity of resources, coupled with the fact that free capitalism has been around for hundreds of years, and everything has always been privately run, it is naturally difficult to get used to such a 180-degree turn psychologically. Moreover, since the Labour Party came to power, they have been vigorously pursuing planned economics and nationalization, but distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. The people are eager for governance and hope for an improvement in their lives and the lifting of controls. However, in the current situation, the Labour government has stated that the existing rationing system will continue for five more years, and the nationalization plan will be extended indefinitely. In the past, Britain's railways, postal services, and even the Bank of England were privately run, but they are now being gradually nationalized. Foreign trade and financial controls are tight, and the government is asking people to fill out more and more forms every day, so the atmosphere of criticism is becoming more and more serious. Former Conservative Prime Minister Churchill fiercely criticized the Labour Party at the party's congress last week, saying that they had misplaced the priorities in their administration, and were just drawing up forms every day for people to fill out, and it looked like the "tearful farewell" that is popular in our country. Old Churchill celebrated his seventy-first birthday the day before yesterday and is preparing to have a major debate with Attlee in Parliament this week.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Britain has been deeply affected by the war, and the lives of the people are still struggling and suffering on the edge. Fortunately, the government is clean and efficient, so many necessary supplies are still available, but controls are tight, so unnecessary or unauthorized supplies are truly impossible to obtain. This is a unique political talent of the British, which others cannot match, and it is feared that Britain's survival today depends on this lifeline. Currently, there is no talk of enjoyment for the British people. From the perspective of someone who has arrived in England from Chongqing, their clothing, housing, and transportation are indeed better than those in China, but the food is too poor, lacking oil and fat, and there is fear of malnutrition. Eating in restaurants is limited by price controls, unless you stuff yourself with bread. Perhaps the authorities are particularly polite to Chinese restaurants, and you can get special food, but it costs ten shillings, which is more than double. Britain is currently experiencing a labor shortage, and women are all out working, but when you ask about their wages, they are very low. It is said that the average weekly salary for the middle and lower working class is only four or five pounds. With this meager amount, after paying rent, there is not enough left to do anything other than eat at self-service cafeterias (which are popular in England and America, where everything is self-service to save on tea service) and barely get by, and there is no room for social interaction. However, this situation still cannot be compared with our country, because prices are not rising much in the first place. Women can still put on makeup and dress up, and movie theaters are still mostly filled with working men and women. Furthermore, it is already difficult for the working class in Chongqing to afford to buy newspapers, but it is not a big deal here, and that is another example.</p>
<p>Democratic Politics on Track, Life Becoming Tense</p>
<p>Looking at Britain's political economy and social measures, if we set aside the rights and wrongs, gains and losses, successes and failures, and look at the spirit of it, there is something admirable. British politics, with its long-standing democratic foundations, can truly be said to be on track. Although there are too many departments in the British cabinet, and their positions are uneven and their names are mixed, the official discipline and administrative efficiency are quite good. The salaries of the British Prime Minister and cabinet members vary greatly. The Prime Minister's annual salary is 10,000 pounds, the major ministers (such as foreign affairs, finance, and military affairs) get 6,000 pounds, and the minor ministers are said to get only 1,000 pounds. After deducting a heavy income tax, even the minor ministers find it difficult to make ends meet and have requested a raise. But it is also enough to show that they probably really live on their salaries. The British have their own unique political skills and seem to have profound plans for economic and social policies. Beveridge's social security plan, which provides full insurance for every person from birth to death, will be implemented by the Labour government, but there has already been a good security system in the past. This can be seen from the fact that every British person, regardless of their status, always has two registration cards: a health card and an employment card. They and their employers pay a small fee to the nearest government authority every month. When they get sick, they can use the card to see a doctor and get medicine without paying a penny. If they become unemployed, they can also use the employment card to receive the prescribed relief from the government. This is certainly a product of the capitalist era, but the scale of social security is roughly in place. However, there are also people who oppose this policy, believing that from now on everyone will not have to work too hard, since the government will always provide food. We work too hard, and we only support those who do not work hard, so why should we work so hard to be model citizens? In reality, everything in the world has a positive and a negative side, and the government can only strive for more strictness, fairness, and reasonableness in its methods.</p>
<p>The situation in London seems much more tense than in Paris. The streets are so crowded with people, all of whom seem to have official business and are walking quickly, not taking leisurely steps. The buildings crowd the streets tightly, and in the middle there is a constant stream of traffic, which reflects in a particularly busy and hurried mood. Furthermore, as the hub of international politics and economics, many important figures come and go here. The preparatory meeting of the United Nations Organization is not over until mid-month, and there are more programs coming one after another. The atomic bomb problem, the Nuremberg trials, the Washington loan negotiations, the dispute over price competition for American airplanes, as well as the Labour government's repeated nationalization plans and the wave of factory strikes fill the various newspapers every day. Fleet Street puts out no less than ten million copies of newspapers a day. The Times has to print seven editions a day, and you can't order it, it's sold out early in the morning. The Standard Evening News starts in the morning. Londoners are constantly concerned about their own livelihood issues, and they are aware of the development of the world. Therefore, except for Buckingham Palace, which is still quiet, the city seems tense and busy everywhere. (34, 12, 5, sent from London)</p>

<h3>Examining the Similarities and Differences Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union from the Perspective of International Friendship — Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department from the December 18th Continental Daily</h3>
<p>The United States and the Soviet Union, these two continental powers, bear a heavier responsibility for the newly gained world peace than any other country. The combined strength of these two countries can maintain world order. They can balance international power, adjust humanity's uncertain predicaments, and at the same time unite other countries, large and small, to ensure a world security organization. Conversely, if these two great forces diverge, any international combination will be hindered.</p>
<p>If the great power nurtured by the United States and the Soviet Union is not directed towards construction, those scientists who study atomic energy might as well immediately take a flying arrow and escape to Venus, so as not to be destroyed along with the Earth. Today, humanity's attainment in physics has reached its peak, and you cannot help but coordinate politics with this invention.</p>
<p>Two Major Axes: Washington and Moscow</p>
<p>There are two fundamentally conflicting political systems in the world, with their axes in Washington and Moscow. If a satisfactory dividing line can be drawn between these two countries, atomic experts can use atomic energy to clear the wastelands of the Sahara and the Arctic, which would be more meaningful.</p>
<p>These two countries have much in common: they both established their countries through revolutionary bloodshed, and they both have large numbers of colonial territories. American pioneers migrated westward towards the ocean, while Soviet pioneers migrated eastward towards the ocean. They both have one ocean—the Pacific Ocean—as their goal. In terms of territorial expansion, the United States and the Soviet Union are very similar. The Mexican-American War and the purchase of the Gadsden Purchase are similar to the Soviet Union's entry into the Caucasus and Turkestan, and its penetration into Mongolia and Manchuria.</p>
<p>Both the United States and the Soviet Union have their own unique industrial revolutions, which have brought about great changes in national wealth and national power. The United States completed its inland river transportation routes due to the oil refining industry and the westward movement of industries, while the Soviet Union developed its raw materials and also moved its industries eastward across the Ural Mountains.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the similarity of the mature national forms of the United States and the Soviet Union. Both have plunged into the whirlpool of international events and no longer adopt traditional isolationism. The Soviet Union controls most of the land and political power in Europe and Asia, and will never shrink into an isolated corner again. The United States dominates North and South America and the seven seas, and will never return to the era of President Jefferson in 1812.</p>
<p>Abandoning Isolation and Plunging into the International Whirlpool</p>
<p>Tradition is difficult to forget, whether in a country or in an individual. Due to previous lessons, Americans generally still believe that Britain is cunning and often takes advantage of them. Therefore, the American people actually distrust their overseas diplomatic representatives, believing that they will inevitably be deceived when dealing with sophisticated foreigners. The Soviet Union also has this instinctive feeling. It has always distrusted any foreign country. It has turned over history and knows that it has been defeated by the Mongols, Turks, Swedes, Poles, and Japanese, and has also been attacked by Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, and the Allied Powers of the Three Kingdoms. Therefore, it has a historic distrust of these neighboring countries and all threatening forces. The Soviet Union only has one border, and it has never suffered any losses from it, and that is the United States.</p>
<p>Continental Countries: Mental and Psychological Connection</p>
<p>In general, Americans and Soviets have many psychological similarities. Perhaps it is the common nature of mankind. They are both generous, frank, and tend to extremes—extreme exaggeration, humor, and heavy drinking. They are also very fascinated by volume, either building the tallest building in the world or building the largest dam in the world. Both take a biased path, combining the superior and the inferior, resulting in two different tendencies: one is superior self-confidence, and the other is fear of backwardness.</p>
<p>The spiritual similarities and differences between the United States and the Soviet Union arouse great interest in the world. Freedom is the foundation of American ideals, while social security is the cornerstone of the Soviet Union. Of course, a compromise is possible between these two extremes, because what America calls freedom is useless to someone who is starving to death, and what the Soviet Union calls social security is meaningless to pioneers.</p>
<p>Now let's talk further about the degree of mutual understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>"In the Soviet Union, although there are still laziness, factional politics, wasting time, restrictions, autocracy, and the police system, if Americans therefore dismiss this great experimental system in this century, thinking that it only represents atheism, the police system, and queuing up for bread, then that is as unreasonable as saying that the United States only represents strikes, lynchings, and racial discrimination.</p>
<p>As the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is developing, these erroneous views must be corrected through the exchange of ideas and education between each other.</p>
<p>Mutual Exploration as a Reference for National Relations</p>
<p>In communist Soviet Union, their intellectuals will tell you: "There is no communism here yet, we are working towards this goal. All we have now is national socialism." There are still millionaires—mostly made in the black market—collective farmers, and beggars. Under Stalinism, the "aristocracy of ability" created by Peter the Great, such as artists, engineers, and generals, still exists. The only difference is that they have no official titles, and their privileges cannot be inherited by their children.</p>
<p>If it is said that the Soviet Union is a mystery that cannot be understood by the outside world, then this statement is obviously outdated. The United States and the Soviet Union have not yet understood each other, and they should explore each other's advantages and disadvantages in the future, as a reference for national relations.</p>
<p>In terms of normal international relations, there is no major reason for competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Because both have raw materials, industry, manpower, and domestic markets. Both can take care of themselves in wartime or peacetime, and the United States and the Soviet Union can take this opportunity to trade with each other, for example, exchanging timber, gasoline, minerals, and furs for instruments, machine products, and industrial inventions.</p>
<p>Atomic Bomb Promotes the Speed of Reconstruction</p>
<p>But the reasons for friction between the two are as follows: (1) mutual distrust, (2) differences in economic thought, and (3) different views on freedom and security.</p>
<p>Strangely, since the invention of the atomic bomb, these two major countries have instead coordinated, and not out of fear or jealousy. The Soviet Union often felt that the standing army trained for national defense cost the treasury a great deal. Now that new weapons have been invented, they can take this opportunity to free up a large amount of manpower for factories, mining, and agriculture, so that the speed of post-war reconstruction can be increased.</p>
<p>Currently, the United States is the largest right-wing country, and the Soviet Union is the largest left-wing country. Both are very careful about protecting their own way of life and rule. If they can mutually guarantee by action that they have no private intentions to clash with each other or to force each other to make social reforms, without the foreign armed intervention of the First World War era, or the Third International that existed in the past, then the friendship between the two countries can be increased. If this hope is realized, the Soviet Union's doors will be wide open, giving foreigners the opportunity to inspect and study. At that time, the United States will begin to understand that what is red is not necessarily hostile. (Written by Sulzberger)</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>Public Doctor System</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>What is Called the "Public Doctor System"?</p>
<p>Before explaining what the "Public Doctor System" is, I would like to draw everyone's attention to the following: Currently, if we get sick and need to see a doctor and buy medicine, these two medical matters often cost a lot of money. What is the result? Naturally, the rich have the means to get cured, while the poor can only suffer from their illnesses. Moreover, "poverty" and "illness" often become causes and effects of each other, cyclically reinforcing each other. The poorer one is, the more illnesses one gets; the more illnesses one gets, the poorer one becomes. Getting sick is already a painful matter, but not being able to get medicine when one is sick is perhaps the most pitiful thing of all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of medicine itself, medical skills and drugs are originally meant to help the world and save lives, but now they have all become commodities. Some doctors, when treating patients, demand more money the more severe the illness becomes, thus turning their medical practice into a tool for extortion. Some medicines are very effective, but they are very expensive. For example, a new medicine invented in America, when brought to China, is not easy to buy on the market. As a result, one bottle of medicine can cost as much as one hundred and twenty thousand. Medicine becoming a commodity also devalues the inherent worth of medicine itself. This is also an unreasonable phenomenon!</p>
<p>In the past, wealthy people, seeing the poor suffering from illness, often engaged in charitable acts of providing medical care and medicine. This was a charitable and philanthropic undertaking of a relief nature. Now, due to the surge of democratic trends, many people believe that the government should bear the responsibility for medical care and medicine for the people when they fall ill. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, advocated the Three Principles of the People. In terms of the Principle of People's Livelihood, he also strongly advocated that we should use the power of the state to ensure that every individual can live a comfortable life. Therefore, in another speech, he advocated that the government should solve the medical problems for the people, so that the poor, when they fall ill, have no other recourse but to resign themselves to fate. Untreated illness and weakness is a blow to the individual, and also a loss to the nation. Now, if the state takes on the responsibility for medical care for the people, so that whether rich or poor, they can receive appropriate treatment when they fall ill, this system is called the "Public Doctor System."</p>
<p>Under the public doctor system, medical care and medicine will no longer be exclusive to the wealthy, nor will they be commodities. The use of medicine will thus advance to a new era.</p>
<p>The countries in the world that have implemented the public doctor system most effectively are the Soviet Union and New Zealand. New Zealand's method is as follows: the country is divided into forty-two regions, and various medical institutions, such as hospitals, maternity hospitals, dental clinics, etc., are evenly distributed according to the size of the population and the area. Half of the funding for these medical institutions is allocated from local tax revenue, and the other half is subsidized by the central government. The management of funds is the responsibility of a board of directors elected by the local people. In New Zealand, 90% of all hospitals and clinics are established by the government, and the remaining 10% of hospitals and clinics, although privately owned, also receive a portion of their funding from the government. Since 1940, the New Zealand government has stipulated that all hospitals and clinics nationwide provide free treatment. This is also the case for private hospitals and clinics. However, for each patient treated by a private hospital or clinic, the government provides a subsidy of two pounds per week. The government also provides another type of subsidy to sick families. Families with a weekly income of less than five pounds receive a subsidy of four shillings per week when a child under the age of sixteen becomes ill. People over the age of sixteen who are unable to work due to illness receive a sickness allowance of about seven shillings per week.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's public doctor system is implemented even more thoroughly. Its methods can be summarized in several points:</p>
<p>(1) All medical personnel, including doctors, pharmacists, nurses, midwives, etc., are civil servants of the state. The majority of them are paid by the government and are subject to government dispatch.</p>
<p>(2) All medical institutions are established by the government, or by the government mobilizing social forces and establishing them under the strict supervision of the government.</p>
<p>(3) The medical expenses of the people are borne by the government. In other words, all medical and drug expenses are paid by the government from tax revenue.</p>
<p>(4) In terms of medical and health technology, the boundary between "prevention" and "treatment" is broken, and "prevention" and "treatment" are regarded as one and the same thing. Now we can understand the meaning of the "Public Doctor System." In summary, the so-called "Public Doctor System" has the following characteristics:</p>
<p>(A) From a political point of view, it is a system in which the government assumes full responsibility for the medical needs of the people:</p>
<p>(B) From an economic point of view, it breaks the restrictions imposed by the private property system on the medical needs of the people.</p>
<p>(C) From a social point of view, it prevents "medicine" and "drugs," which save lives and help the world, from becoming commodities in the marketplace.</p>
<p>(D) From a technical point of view, it breaks the defect in medicine of separating "prevention" and "treatment" into two separate things.</p>
<p>Our China, in order to realize the Three Principles of the People of the Father of the Nation, must also adopt such a system in terms of medical care and hygiene. Therefore, at the Fifth Session of the Eighth Plenary of the Kuomintang, a motion was passed to "implement a public doctor system to ensure the health of all people," and the government then actively planned to implement it based on this motion. In May of the twenty-ninth year [1940], the Executive Yuan announced an "Outline of Hygiene Organizations at All Levels in the County," in conjunction with the "New County System," stipulating that each county should establish a health institute, each district below the county should establish a health branch, each township should establish a health center, and each bao [neighborhood unit] should set up a health worker. According to statistics, by July of the thirty-third year [1944], among the one thousand three hundred and sixty-one counties in the twenty provinces in the rear, nine hundred and thirty-eight counties had established health institutes, one hundred and ninety-six health branches, one thousand five hundred and sixty-one township health centers, and one thousand five hundred and seventy-seven bao health workers. This is the initial step in implementing the "Public Doctor System," which is to make medical institutions widespread throughout the country and deeply rooted among the people in terms of organization. However, implementing such a system is extremely difficult. The most important thing is that the promotion of the "Public Doctor System" requires a large number of talents and funds, and we currently do not have appropriate solutions for these two items. However, the Father of the Nation tells us: "It is difficult to know, but not difficult to do." As long as we believe in this system and believe that this system must be implemented, and use the strength of our entire country to support it and promote it, I believe that even if there are greater difficulties, we can certainly solve them satisfactorily. By "the strength of the entire country," I mean that this matter requires not only the government's efforts, but also the cooperation of all the people of the country. Only in this way can this system be realized as soon as possible. I am raising this topic today, on the one hand, to hope that everyone understands this system, and at the same time, I hope that everyone supports this system and promotes this system.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Divergent Opinions on New Exchange Rate; Gold Market Strengthens Again; US Dollars and Hong Kong Notes Both Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that the opinions of the local industrial, commercial, and financial sectors on the new exchange rate strongly advocated for a rate of 1,600 to 1, as suggested to Mr. Bei Songsun of the Central Bank of China. This news made people feel bullish, and buying interest was revived. Although the market opened flat, due to buyers scrambling to purchase, prices rose to 762,000. Many parties sold at high prices, slightly suppressing the market, but strong players continued to absorb. Thereafter, the market mostly fluctuated, with minimal ups and downs. In the afternoon, it also struggled around 755,000. As a result, the market closed up 24,000 compared to the previous day. General sentiment gradually ceased to expect an overly low new exchange rate, and the market showed signs of recovery. Gold jewelry was listed at 81,000, silver at 600 yuan, and silver dollars showed little progress, fluctuating between 440 and 445. Although the North China Daily News carried a report that a US senator proposed that the government should sell silver at the official price of 71 cents, otherwise the black market would rise to $1.29 and be unstoppable, this news did not attract attention. Private lending, boosted by securities to lift the stock market, saw gradually increasing demand, slightly tightening. Private lending stabilized at around 10%.</p>
<p>US dollars, due to slightly positive news, boosted sentiment. After opening, the price rose from 1,230 yuan to 1,265 yuan. Thereafter, some parties sold to profit, and the supply was slightly abundant, so the market fluctuated slightly with the gold market. Finally, the price hovered around 1,255 yuan, resulting in a rise of 43 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes continued to rise steadily. It was heard that the local market price still equated to 80 yuan in the Shanghai market. If calculated with exchange rates, it was still deemed profitable. People in the shipping industry had some demand, resulting in old notes rising slightly by 5 yuan and new notes rising by 6 yuan. However, supply and demand gradually balanced at high prices, and market prices also varied.</p>
<h3>Major Players Exert Effort to Boost Market; Chinese Stocks Advance Vigorously; Government Bonds Decline While Foreign Stocks Remain Steady</h3>
<p>Initially, government bonds saw many parties selling due to reports that interest could be paid in Shanghai from today, but the principal would still have to wait for tariff revenue to accumulate. Category C bonds fell below 630 yuan, and miscellaneous bonds fell below 350 yuan. Later, with slight purchases from Northern traders, support was obtained. At noon, stimulated by the stock market, retail investors gradually became active, returning above the 700 yuan mark and closing at high prices. However, the result was still a slight decline compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks saw strong prospects as the Securities Industry Association scheduled a founding meeting at the Chamber of Commerce on Sunday. Eighty old brokers had also gathered the day before. New parties actively participated, making the lineup strong. Two major players in the securities industry, Yongsha and Xinguang, exerted special effort, making prices extremely brilliant. Xinguang, due to a careless factory address, initially fell to 34 yuan, with supply exceeding demand, ranking behind Jingfu by more than 2 yuan. Later, major players intervened to boost the market, and retail investors also followed suit, immediately rebounding to above 40 yuan, still leading the small rally. The yarn factory also had major new players joining, making it much more vibrant than Meiya. With demand exceeding supply, many closed at high prices at noon. As a result, Yongsha rose 40 yuan compared to the previous close, Meiya only 5 yuan, Jingfu 2 yuan, Qinxing 1 yuan, and Xinguang remained flat. However, buying interest did not cease in the afternoon, with Yongsha rising to 730 yuan, Meiya to 565 yuan, and Xinguang to 43 yuan. The major players' boost greatly excited people.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks initially showed weakness due to some parties selling, but securities firms still absorbed them, and investors continued their efforts. At noon, they remained steady. As a result, results were mixed compared to the previous close. Supply and demand were still balanced, and trading gradually increased. However, market prices varied considerably due to differing supply and demand at each firm.</p>

Flour saw smooth purchases by both northern and southern traders, making the market active and rising by over 100 yuan. Soybean cake continued to be loaded in Taiwan, making it very popular, rising by another 200-300 yuan. Shantou's local street saw sluggish sales due to the flat oil market. However, demand from Ningbo and Fujian was strong, causing prices to tighten by several hundred to one thousand yuan. Red sorghum was scarce, rising by 100 yuan. Raw peanuts, with Nanjing, Yangzhou, and Qingdao as major production areas, saw only sporadic arrivals, insufficient to meet demand.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was flat. Although prices briefly surged in the morning, rising by 20,000, they fell back due to profit-taking retailers offering substantial sales. The closing price was similar to the previous day. However, customer sales were weaker, sentiment turned bearish, and the trend seemed less strong than in previous days.</p>
<h3>Yellow Croaker Sold at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>(Our report) The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau will sell yellow croaker at flat prices today. Large yellow croaker, previously priced at 112 yuan per catty, is now reduced to 96 yuan, and small yellow croaker will be sold at 80 yuan per catty.</p>
<p>The bureau previously stipulated that 50,000 bolts of flat-priced cloth would be delivered to the Central Trust Bureau for sale in Chongqing.

<p>The Iron Printing and Can Manufacturing Industry, after Wei Jiuqing, Wu Shaowu, Chen Shaonan, Wu Renji, and Wang Hexuan were appointed as organizing committee members and began organizing, saw other related industries, such as the manufacture of soft tubes, bottle caps, and steel refining factories, applying to join the association one after another.

<h3>Small Enemy Factories Valuation Commences</h3>
<p>(Our special report) The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau's bidding for 47 small factories has long been noticed by various parties. Manufacturers returning to Shanghai from the rear are requesting priority purchase, and the society organized by these technicians has also expressed its intention to take over management. The Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, etc., stated that many factories in Shanghai were destroyed during the war and also requested to purchase them at flat prices to resume production. Most of these are chemical factories, followed by textile and iron and electrical materials factories, etc. To ensure thoroughness, the Handling Bureau has organized a valuation committee, hiring experts from various industries to verify estimates. The organization is divided into chemical, textile, machinery, and land groups, which have held several meetings and discussed matters in groups, with the aim of handling matters with a fair and rigorous attitude. It is heard that the valuation of several chemical factories, iron factories, and textile factories has been completed and will be submitted to the review committee for review. It is said that the original cost is generally used as the standard, with appropriate discounts based on the season and quantity of the goods. Machinery, factory buildings, etc. are leveled according to depreciation rates and the age of their use. In the coming days, they will also investigate and evaluate the remaining factories separately, completing this work by the end of the national calendar year.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Delayed Distribution of Enemy and Puppet Materials Bonuses</h3>
<p>[Our report] Since the restoration, there have been regulations for secret reports and bonuses for enemy and puppet materials. It is understood that there are no fewer than one thousand such cases. The bonus amount needs to be determined by evaluating the recovered materials, which is a cumbersome procedure, and the responsible agency does not have anyone specifically dedicated to this task, so most of these bonuses have not yet been distributed.

<h3>The Headmasters of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in This City State the Difficulties of Private Schools, Envoy Niu Promises to Forward the Report to the Central Government</h3>
<p>[This City News] Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, over 140 headmasters from private primary and secondary schools in this city, including Nanmo, Minguo, Daozhong, Nanyang, Mingde, Aiguo, Shenghuo, Kunfan, and Cunde, gathered at the Hongmian Restaurant to host Envoys Ye and Niu, as well as Committee Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Committee Chairman Wu Shaoshu, Education Vice-Minister Hang Liwu, Bureau Chief Gu Yuxiu, and Deputy Bureau Chief Li Ximou. Envoy Ye was unable to attend due to illness. Jiang Shaozhou first delivered an opening speech, followed by Envoy Niu, who stated briefly:</p>
<p>Niu Envoy's Address</p>
<p>"This time in Shanghai, the Chairman instructed me to investigate and inquire about the hardships in various aspects. Important matters should be referred for instructions, while the rest should be resolved locally or by the relevant departments. There is a traditional Chinese taboo against knowing something but not speaking up, leading to many misunderstandings. I hope you will all offer your opinions as much as possible. It would be best to have a written report, which can be forwarded to the central government as a document of our visit. As for schools, whether public or private, they are essentially the same. Private schools can supplement what the state cannot, and their contributions are truly great. I hope you will all uphold your original intentions and carry them forward." Next, Education Vice-Minister Hang delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Hang Education Vice-Minister's Address</p>
<p>"I deeply admire your hard work and perseverance during the past eight years. In this period of national reconstruction, talent is needed, and education is the source of talent, as detailed in Chairman's book, "China's Destiny." Going forward, you should pay attention to two points: (1) We are now in a new era, and new education methods should be used. Film and radio are extremely effective. (2) Physical education and group education are essential. Without a healthy body and a cooperative mindset, construction is impossible. We felt this weakness in the nation during the eight years of resistance." Next, Committee Chairman Pan delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Pan Committee Chairman's Address</p>
<p>"I have overseen education in this city in the past, and I am an old friend to you all. While in Chongqing, I knew that you all remained steadfast during the eight years. Now, under the leadership of Bureau Chief Gu and Deputy Bureau Chief Li, we will certainly be able to expand further. Recently, the administrative aspects have been unified. In this new era of new construction, the most important issues are school sites, funding, teachers, and equipment. To run a perfect school, none of these can be lacking. However, these four issues are currently thorny. Dishonest merchants hoarding goods and speculating are still loudly complaining about hardship, unaware that the truly distressed during the war were those in the education sector. It would be best to solicit donations from these wealthy merchants to find a solution." Afterwards, Bureau Chief Gu and Deputy Bureau Chief Li delivered speeches in succession. Zhou Feicheng, representing the Municipal Education Association, expressed his opinions. Subsequently, the headmasters of various schools separately described the difficulties faced by private schools and submitted a</p>
<p>Joint Petition</p>
<p>The joint petition from the private primary and secondary schools requested that Envoys Ye and Niu forward it to the central government. The key points of the original petition are as follows: (1) Request the government to earnestly support the development of private schools. (2) Request an increase in tuition fees for private schools. (3) Formulate laws and regulations to protect school buildings and ensure their effective implementation. (4) Request commendations for principals and teachers who faithfully adhered to laws and regulations and steadfastly remained in their positions during the war. (5) Request an increase in the number of education representatives in local public opinion organs, such as the Municipal Council. Envoy Niu promised to forward the petition. Finally, Zhang Tianbai delivered a thank-you speech, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>The First Verdict in the Traitor Case, Chen Riping Conspires with the Enemy, Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Deprivation of Civil Rights for Life, All Property Confiscated</h3>
<p>Chen Riping, a traitor who held positions in the puppet Legislative Yuan and other puppet posts, was sentenced yesterday afternoon at 3 PM by the collegiate panel of the Provisional High Court in Tilanqiao. The audience was extremely crowded. Chen Riping's daughter, Chen Yizhen, was also among the listeners. Chen Riping's defense lawyer, Qian Naiwen, also arrived on time. At 3 PM sharp, Court President Liu, Judge Cao, Judge Zhu, Prosecutor Lin, and Recorder Wang entered the court. Chen Riping was escorted in by court police. Court President Liu said, "Chen Riping, today your verdict will be announced. If you do not agree, you may request a retrial within ten days." Then he stood up and read the</p>
<p>Verdict</p>
<p>The text read: "Chen Riping is in collusion with an enemy country, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to life imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for life, confiscation of all property, and the confiscation of a commemorative medal from the puppet Reformed Government and a badge from the Shanghai Special City Advisory Committee."</p>
<p>Held Multiple Puppet Positions</p>
<p>Chen Riping is currently 59 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. He was born in Yokohama, Japan, and graduated from Waseda University in Tokyo. He returned to China in 1920 and practiced law at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Chongming Road. In the second year of the War of Resistance Against Japan (1938), he was enticed by a Japanese man named Osada Shigeru to serve as a "Legislative Member" of the puppet Reformed Government. He then served as "Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance," "Supervisor of the Huaxing Bank," "Director of the Economic Department of the First District Office of Shanghai," "Member of the Shanghai Special City Advisory Committee," and "Vice President" of the former Xinwen Daily. Chen Riping's repeated service in puppet positions constitutes a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, which prohibits collusion with an enemy country and plotting to resist one's own country. Chen Riping's life sentence marks the first traitor case verdict in this city.</p>

The total revenue of the Finance Bureau was approximately 16 million yuan in September, 11.3 million yuan in October, and 27.8 million yuan in November. The total monthly expenditures of the Municipal Government were over 56 million yuan in September, 107.9 million yuan in October, and approximately 127.8 million yuan in November. There was a deficit of over 40 million yuan in September, over 96.6 million yuan in October, and over 100 million yuan in November.

<p>Operation Committee Organization Completed</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The organization of the Municipal Real Estate Operation Committee has been completed, with Huang Boqiaozu serving as the chairman. The committee has now printed application forms and established application procedures. However, as the committee is an auditing agency, all matters regarding business are handled by the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau in conjunction with the Central Trust Bureau. Those wishing to rent or purchase real estate can register and apply directly with the Handling Bureau, but as there is not much remaining real estate after the takeover, government agencies have priority.</p>

<h3>Central Committee Member Wu Kaixian Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Chongqing</h3>
<p>Central Committee Member Wu Kaixian left Chongqing yesterday morning and arrived at Longhua Airport in Shanghai at 5 PM. Many of Wu's friends gathered at the airport to welcome him. After disembarking, Wu immediately drove to his private residence on McKinley Road for rest. During the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, Wu was appointed to Shanghai to direct the party and government work behind enemy lines in the Southeast, and his achievements were remarkable. In March 1942, he was arrested by the Japanese military police, who used all kinds of cruel tortures to persecute him, but Wu remained loyal, steadfast, and never yielded. He attempted suicide several times in prison but was prevented each time. After being imprisoned for over a year, he escaped from Shanghai and went to Chongqing in the spring of 1943. The central authorities greatly comforted him. Wu stayed in Chongqing for over two years. Today, he is reunited with people in Shanghai, and he expresses his heartfelt joy.</p>
<h3>Garrison Headquarters Rectifies Military Discipline, Strictly Prohibits Impersonation and Extortion</h3>
<p>Li Jilan, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Songhu Garrison, stated in a speech yesterday: "The main tasks of this headquarters in the past three months have been to stabilize the local area and rectify military discipline. Among the officers of this headquarters, Song Tingzhu, the mortar company commander of the special service regiment, and Ni Ying, the special service chief, have been sentenced to death for violating discipline. Chen Zihua, a lieutenant colonel staff officer, and Zhang Linken, a lieutenant adjutant, have been sentenced to imprisonment for taking advantage of their positions to fraudulently obtain property. Chen Shouchang, the commander of the special service regiment, and others are currently detained pending trial. All of this is sufficient to demonstrate Commander-in-Chief Qian's emphasis on rectifying military discipline. However, in recent months, four cases of impersonation of the names of the inspection office and the military law office of this headquarters for extortion have been discovered. One case involved impersonating the inspection office to affix seals without authorization. Another case involved impersonating the military law office and detaining people on Pubushi Road. All of the above have been captured. In addition, Lu Wenzhi, who impersonated the deputy director of the military law office, defrauded Xu Renfu of 11,400 legal currency at No. 36, Lane 242, Tiantong Road. He Huaqiang, who impersonated a major inspector of the military law office, is recruiting labor externally, and we are still ordering our subordinates to strictly investigate and handle the case. We hereby solemnly declare that there is no position of deputy director in the military law office of this headquarters. Since its establishment, whether accepting any case or not, we only handle it according to the law and never send anyone to mediate. If there are unscrupulous officers and soldiers extorting money or bandits impersonating the name of this headquarters to extort money, they may be reported to the nearby military police at any time for arrest and strict handling by this headquarters, and the facts may be reported to the confidential mailbox of this headquarters (P.O. Box 218, Shanghai General Post Office)."</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Foreign Trade: Merchants Allowed Free Shipping, Except for Controlled Coal, Sugar, Rice, etc.</h3>
<p>The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Chief's Office in Shanghai stated that Taiwan's administrative authorities have decided on foreign trade measures that, excluding controlled goods such as coal, sugar, and rice, as well as specialized items like tobacco and alcohol, merchants can freely trade and ship exports. However, due to a shortage of ships and the unresolved exchange rate between the legal tender (法幣) and the Taiwan currency (台幣), there is currently no large-scale trade. The exchange rate between the Taiwan currency and the legal tender is currently being submitted by the Taiwan administrative authorities to the central authorities for a decision. Lu Zongxian, Xu Benchun, and four others from the Resources Committee assigned to work in Taiwan, and Xu Zhengyi from the Shanghai branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, will all fly to Taiwan on the 24th.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Taiwanese Sugar Arrive</p>
<p>Since Taiwan's recovery, waterways have been cleared. In addition to outgoing shipments to transport coal, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched the *Xin Ruian* and *Jiang Ning* vessels, carrying mostly relief supplies. The primary import is sugar. The Taiwan Customs Office has also been established, and the railway is being taken over. The total length of the province's railway is 4,085 kilometers, originally divided into the Western Trunk Line and the Taitung Line. Bridges in various locations have suffered significant damage. Recently, a portion has been temporarily repaired and opened to traffic, and materials are being awaited. It is expected that the entire line can be officially repaired in approximately three months. The Taiwan Provincial Trade Company has established an office in the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to facilitate commercial contact between Shanghai and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Sending Letters to Taiwan Using Airmail</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration announced that from December 25th of this year, China National Aviation Corporation aircraft will begin flights between Shanghai and Taiwan, flying from Shanghai to Taipei every Tuesday and returning to Shanghai on the same day, carrying mail. Currently, due to the scarcity of ships between Shanghai and Taiwan, the public should make full use of airmail to send letters and postcards to Taiwan for speed and efficiency.</p>
<h3>Encouraging Export Trade: Many Kinds of Goods are Exempt from Tax</h3>
<p>Since the surrender of the Japanese army, shipping routes between our country and foreign countries have gradually been restored in a short period of time. As a result, the import and export trade of this port has gradually become prosperous. In order to encourage the export trade of local products, our government has granted tax-free export preferential treatment for many products such as honey, black tea, brick tea, coarse and fine summer cloth, sorghum, and millet, so that they can compete with foreign goods in the foreign market.</p>
<h3>Gas-Powered Shallow-Draft Vessel: Maiden Voyage Soon to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to remedy the difficulties of navigation in the Yongdao of the Sichuan River, which has many rapids and shoals, the Chongqing Huaxi Company began research in October 1943, using gas as a power source. By the spring of 1944, the gas design was completed, and with the assistance of the US military headquarters, the experiment was successful. The first vessel, *Meiya*, has been completed and is operating in rapids, with no difficulties going up or down. It departed Chongqing on its maiden voyage eastward on the 1st of this month and arrived in Hankou on the 8th and will soon arrive in Shanghai. The structure and engine of the vessel are based on automobile engines.

<h3>Year-End Approaching: Human-Powered Vehicles to be Allowed on Nanjing Road Again</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the prohibition of human-powered vehicles on Nanjing Road in this city, the business of shops along the road has been greatly affected. As the old and new years approach, the road remains deserted. Yesterday, Central Executive Committee member Pan Gongzhan and Councilor Xi Yushu, observing this situation, noted that American military vehicles already have a licensing system. Given that year-end goods purchasing must take into account the needs and convenience of merchants, the public, and the citizens. They jointly sent a letter to Mayors Qian and He, suggesting that the ban be temporarily lifted for two months starting from the 23rd of this month, to allow citizens to take various vehicles to purchase goods from shops on that road. This proposal has now attracted the attention of the municipal authorities. According to reliable sources, the municipal government is currently drafting a new traffic regulation for Nanjing Road, which will allow various human-powered vehicles to pass freely on Nanjing Road outside of specified hours. If this measure yields good results, it may be fully opened in the future.</p>

<h3>Relief Supplies: Transshipment from Shanghai to the Whole Country Begins, with Hankou, Tianjin, etc., as Distribution Centers</h3>
<p>The supplies of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which were once piled up and congested in Shanghai's docks and warehouses, have now begun to be transported to islands and coastal areas in urgent need. Relief officials are quite satisfied that China's current situation has begun to gradually advance this work. The first batch of ships carrying 76,000 tons of relief supplies has been unloaded. Most of it is food, most of which has been moved from the docks, with only 11,000 tons remaining in warehouses, waiting to be transported to distribution centers in Hankou, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Kowloon. A portion of the flour has been sold to the Kailuan Coal Mining Company near Tianjin. The company has doubled its coal production after obtaining this urgently needed flour. The Shanghai branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will ship 20,000 tons of supplies out of Shanghai in the next two weeks. Food will be distributed by 15 branch offices, some of which will be provided free of charge to workers in public works projects. However, in areas where people have purchasing power, some scarce goods may be sold. The funds from the sales will be used to facilitate the repatriation of refugees and promote relief work in other areas. Some foreign refugees, most notably Jewish refugees, will receive assistance from the Shanghai branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In addition, some refugees have registered with the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to await repatriation.</p>

<h3>First Sale of 50,000 Bags: Striving for Widespread Flour Sales, Each Retailer Can Apply for 50 Bags</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has shipped seven ships of wheat to China, totaling over 45,000 tons, except for one ship (*East Bourne*) which is still being unloaded. The quality of this wheat is excellent. The Executive Yuan of our country and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have entrusted the Fuxin and Fufeng factories in this city to mill and bag the wheat and transport it to various parts of the country. In this city, in addition to the first phase of 50,000 bags that have already been sold, the second phase of applications began the day before yesterday. In the past two days, the number of registered individuals has reached more than 2,400. Today is the last day for registration. According to the person in charge of the temporary office of the Fuxin and Fufeng flour companies, which are handling the registration, the purpose of this sale is to be as widespread as possible, so the scope is wider than the first phase, and the amount of flour will also be increased. It is now divided into three types. First, retailers, bread and biscuit merchants, and consumer cooperatives can apply for a maximum of 50 bags. Second, noodle merchants and dessert shops can apply for a maximum of 20 bags per household. Third, flatbread stalls can apply for a maximum of 10 bags per stall.

<h3>Minyu Vessel Suddenly Sank in the Huangpu River Yesterday Morning: Passengers Unharmed, Cargo and Luggage Lost</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Minsheng Company's *Minyu* vessel, originally scheduled to sail to Chongqing yesterday morning, was postponed to depart yesterday morning due to insufficient loading. Unexpectedly, around midnight yesterday morning, it suddenly began to take on water and sank. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Recently Repaired, Sailing to Chongqing</p>
<p>The *Minyu* vessel had a gross tonnage of 232 tons and was a riverboat sailing the Chongqing-Yibin route. The shipowner was Ningbo native Wang Fucheng, who also served as the first mate. The crew consisted of more than 40 people. At the end of October, the vessel left Chongqing to sail downstream. It was delayed in Hankou for a long time, arriving in Shanghai in early December. On the 4th, it arrived in Shanghai and entered the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. It was repaired on the 19th and moved to Wharf No. 3 on the Bund of Wuma Road to load cargo and passengers for Chongqing. It was originally scheduled to depart yesterday morning, but due to procedural issues, the loading was delayed until the day before yesterday. It loaded 97 pieces of cotton yarn, 21 pieces of cotton cloth, 80 barrels of diesel, 100 cans of machine oil, totaling 464 pieces of cargo, totaling over 60 tons. According to the vessel's capacity, it was loaded about 15% less than its capacity, so the draft was not heavy. There were only 65 passengers. The cargo was loaded at about 7 o'clock, and the passengers boarded the ship at 9 o'clock. The crew had already rested.</p>
<p>Tilting to Starboard and Sinking Immediately</p>
<p>Around midnight, the ship's body tilted to starboard, and the tide water penetrated the rear shackle hole and immediately flowed into the cargo hold. Passengers sleeping on the cargo hold were shocked and shouted loudly. The crew heard the news and rushed to the rescue, using buckets to scoop out the water, but more water came in than could be scooped out. For a time, there was no way to stop the water, and the order was in chaos. The passengers then landed in the chaos. The tide surged in from the rear hatch into the engine room. In a blink of an eye, the same amount of water entered the front cabin. The crew also went ashore and watched the ship sink. Within a quarter of an hour, the entire ship was submerged, with only the top of the ship and the chimney left out of the water. All the cargo and luggage were submerged. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
<p>The Company is Salvaging</p>
<p>After dawn, the company was notified. The company immediately discussed the matter with the Jiangnan Shipyard. Two wooden barges and two underwater workers were dispatched to enter the cabin and salvage objects. By the evening, 11 pieces of cotton yarn, 6 barrels of diesel, and many clothes and miscellaneous items had been salvaged. Salvage operations will continue today. After the cargo is salvaged and the ship's body is lightened, methods will be found to salvage the vessel. The company believes that the accident is very bizarre, considering that the vessel had just been repaired and that the cargo was not heavily loaded. It is currently being investigated. Those who have purchased tickets for the *Minyu* vessel can transfer to the *Minzu* vessel, which is scheduled to depart on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Vehicles Drive on the Right in Yucheng: Printing Clear Pictures</h3>

It has also designated the hand gestures for drivers and the hand gestures for traffic police. It stipulates that the maximum speed for vehicles driving in the city is 5 kilometers per hour, and the maximum speed outside the city must not exceed 50 kilometers. The distance between the front and rear vehicles must be up to 5 meters in the city and not allowed to drive within 50 meters outside the city. Specific methods have also been specified for turning vehicles in great detail.</p>
<h3>Post Office to Hold Insurance Anniversary for Policyholders</h3>

From the 1st of this month to the end of February, it is all for 15-year terms, and the insurance amount is divided into five types: 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, 30,000 yuan, 40,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Five New Unified Taxes to Be Launched Next Year</h3>
<p>It is reported that the tax authorities plan to increase revenue for post-war reconstruction and will launch unified taxes on the following goods in 1946: (1) wheat flour, (2) tea, (3) cement, (4) fur, (5) tinfoil and superstitious paper products. It is heard that the budgeted figures have been included in next year's revenue budget. The implementation plan is currently being drafted.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian Hit by Tram</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) At about 6 pm yesterday at the foot of the old garbage bridge on North Zhejiang Road, a Route 5 tram traveling there from north to south hit three pedestrians, Liu Deshui, Liao Jiayou, and Zhou Chengwen, who could not avoid it in time, knocking them to the ground and injuring their feet and waists. Later, the police officers from the Old Zhabei Branch sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Robbery on West Guangfu Road: One Thief Captured During Robbery</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At about 7:15 pm yesterday, six bandits came to the home of villager Zhang Xianquan at No. 3 Zhangjia Bridge, West Guangfu Road, Zhabei. Fortunately, the neighbors discovered it and shouted loudly. The bandits panicked and fled out the door. The last bandit was finally captured by the victim and his gun was snatched. He then fired the gun, hitting the bandit in the abdomen. He was bleeding non-stop and fell to the ground and was captured. The rest of the bandits all fled and disappeared. The nearby police station was notified afterwards, and the injured thief was sent to the Red Cross Hospital by car and then transferred to the police hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>The "Jianshan Maru" of the enemy-run Central China Shipping Company sank after hitting a mine on June 19 of this year, and all 33 Chinese employees on board were killed.

<h3>Japanese Residents Management Office Holds Women's Forum: Reviewing All Aspects of the Awareness Movement</h3>
<p>— Mai Tian</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the Japanese Residents Management Office held a Japanese women's forum in the auditorium of the office on Dixwei Road. More than a dozen Japanese women intellectual leaders were present, and more than 20 representatives from the women's community and reporters from this city were specially invited to participate.</p>
<p>The topic discussed at the forum was: "The Japanese Women's Awareness Movement." Mr. Wang Guanghan, the director of the office, said: "The times are advancing, and the demand to achieve equality between men and women is necessary. But how can we achieve true equality between men and women? Everyone can discuss it with each other as much as possible today."</p>
<p>Japanese Men and Women Must Be Liberated</p>
<p>The women's forum was started by a Japanese man, Sota, whose opinion was that regarding the liberation of Japan, not only women should be liberated, but men should also be liberated. He believes that liberation should start from two principles. First, the liberation of mankind. Second, women should be liberated by men. Because in today's society and politics, men have all kinds of priority rights, so men must give women the right to participate, and mainly start with how men oppress women. Ms. Yamagishi Takako then expressed her grand theory. She said that she herself had not been oppressed by men, but she had been oppressed by the family. She feels that women leaving their families and farmers going to cities to engage in industry is the same principle. This phenomenon exists in all countries in the world now, and Japanese women should not fall behind. Next, Mrs. Zeita expressed her views. She believes that (1) Japanese women are too indifferent to participating in politics. (2) Women's opinions are different from men's, and it is worth considering whether participation in politics will affect national affairs, so she hopes that Japanese women in the future will, on the one hand, cultivate and study knowledge by themselves, and understand domestic and foreign affairs clearly in order to participate in politics, and on the other hand, require the country to be impartial between men and women.</p>
<p>Bearing Responsibility for All Misfortune</p>
<p>Mr. Tokuda got up again to add a few words, recounting the history of the Japanese women's movement. Then, Ms. Huang Daping of the local court stood up and said that the country belongs to every citizen, and women should also bear responsibility. And women's love of peace is stronger than men's. All rights cannot be abandoned.</p>
<p>Ms. Yamagishi immediately jumped up to challenge her. She said that Japan should bear responsibility for all the misfortunes it has caused. However, if we say that women's love of peace is stronger than men's, that seems a bit untrue. Another Japanese female youth leader who studied in the United States, Naito Takashi, felt that women's issues should be regarded as an obligation.</p>
<p>Advising Japanese Women on Two Points</p>
<p>After Ms. Yamagishi finished speaking, Ms. Zhuang Keling, the director of the female youth group of the Sanqing League, stood up to explain and prove how women love peace. She finally advised Japanese women on two points: first, in the future, we must continue to strive to eliminate slavery. Second, go back to educate the people and improve the past aggressive education. Yamagishi had to express that she represented Japanese women in apologizing to Chinese women and accepted the opinions. Other representatives from the Education Bureau, Ms. Shangguan Yu, and Ms. Pu Dagong of Women's Monthly also followed Ms. Zhuang's meaning and gave Japanese women some faithful advice before the meeting was dismissed.</p>
<p>Not Knowing Much About China</p>
<p>After the meal, the Japanese Residents Management Office also invited Chinese women representatives and reporters to go to Wusong to hold a forum with the Japanese female soldiers of the Flower Garden troops. From the conversations of various people, a conclusion was reached: they all believed that they did not know much about China. They all hope to live in China often. They will go back and tell their sisters all the good things about China and the Chinese people.</p>
<p>However, we must not forget that although Japan has been defeated, their national character and the aggressive education they have received have not changed at all. They are still dangerous things. One female soldier asked us why uneducated women in China are very close to them, but highly educated women are cold to them? It can be seen what kind of edification they have received. Have they been "self-conscious"?</p>
<p>Since the Japanese surrender, Japanese women have gradually been able to rise from the oppression of the traditional system. The Japanese Residents Management Office in this city, in view of the importance of women's issues, specially convened a Japanese women's forum yesterday. Many Japanese intellectual leaders and representatives from the women's community in this city participated, which is of great significance.</p>

<h3>The Rebirth of Film and Drama</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>For the past eight years, film production organizations in the occupied territories, controlled by the enemy and puppet regimes, along with some theater performances influenced by them, have now been eliminated with the surrender of the enemy. Before us lies a vast, open field, and some broken props. Everything awaits our transformation and creation, so that the dead film and drama life can be awakened anew.</p>
<p>We need film and drama, but it must be reborn. It must keep pace with this great era. We will not only be satisfied with crushing the enemy's and puppet regime's usurpation, but we will also eliminate those outdated and degenerate parasites.</p>
<p>The establishment of the new "Film and Drama" truly involves countless threads, which cannot be completely covered in a single piece of paper. Therefore, we have decided not to fear the complexity and start from scratch. Starting this week, Shen Bao is opening up this valuable garden to us—to all enthusiasts of film and drama, allowing us all to use it as a horticultural experimental field to support the rebirth of film and drama. We hope to nurture this garden with the passionate emotion of looking forward to the completion of the rebirth of film and drama.</p>
<p>The reborn "Film and Drama" will soon become readers' close friends. We will meet once every Sunday.</p>
<h3>"Boundless Future" Overture</h3>
<p>— Jishi</p>
<p>"Boundless Future" is a valuable work produced during the Pacific War. It is a major anti-Japanese production by the Central Film Studio. The screen unfolds the story of a group of young people staying in the South, struggling to make ends meet. They have nothing, only a patriotic passion and group firepower. They fight the environment, and they are all searching for a bright path. Then, our heroine appears. She appears under the dim streetlights, a poignant and stunning Southern beauty, whose circumstances are like that of a beautiful woman with a tragic fate. Her happy family was shattered by the artillery fire of the brutal enemy. She was washed up in the South and forced into prostitution, spending her days in tears. She escaped and was rescued by these poor young people, escaping the devil's den. However, a distorted society led her down a crooked path. She went to the stage, and her natural beauty and talent made her a singing and dancing star. The director forced her to wear less and less clothing, and she had no choice but to leave and join the "Boundless Future" on the "Road to the Front."</p>
<p>The chance encounter between the male lead, Li Qing, and the female lead, Rong Xiaoyi, is a lyrical poem written with blood and tears, but during this time, there is no "I love you" kind of cheesy performance. There is only a tacit understanding that the naked eye cannot see.</p>
<p>In this film full of tragic atmosphere, relaxed humor and innocent comedic elements are added from time to time. The greatest contribution comes from Li Pai's comedic actor Li Jingbo and the child star Rong Rong, who is less than three feet tall. Audiences will like them after meeting them.</p>
<p>The film exposes the inside story of the dark society everywhere. This is director Cai Chusheng's masterpiece. Those who have seen "Song of the Fishermen" and "The Lost Lamb" will also like this film. Because it not only freely expresses his anti-Japanese consciousness, but also retains the "Chusheng" atmosphere of the Cai family's old shop. You can smell it from the screen.</p>
<p>Finally, let us not neglect the film's various contrasting and alternating styles, such as lightness in seriousness, comedy in tragedy, song and dance in tension, vernacular in Mandarin, and light in darkness, showing that this film is a comprehensive and quintessential masterpiece. There are three interludes: "Boundless Future Theme Song," "Song of Eight Hundred Heroes," and Rong Xiaoyi's sentimental song.</p>
<p>The film is scheduled to be released in Shanghai on New Year's Day. Let us wait and see!</p>
<h3>"Boundless Future" a shot starring Li Qing</h3>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>About "Night Shop"</h3>
<p>— Shao Zijie</p>
<p>To be honest, I have to admit that "Night Shop" is a high-standard play. Throughout the play is the life of the dregs of humanity. They are all too miserable. Society has pushed them into hell. It is not that they do not know love or hate. On the contrary, they did once have hope and were willing to sacrifice. However, reality makes them selfishly compete. As the editor said, "This is not a story, this is a society." Penetrating "Night Shop" is indeed living reality, the kind souls of the lower society.</p>
<p>Through the adaptation of the playwright, the characters, personalities, and atmosphere of "Night Shop" have indeed been more nationalized. However, regrettably, I have to wonder whether "Night Shop" will be suitable for our place. The characters in "Night Shop" are indeed commonly seen, but the gathering place of lower society life in the Night Shop is at least not very common in China.</p>
<p>"Night Shop" is revealing. Because of this, we can nakedly see their smiles and hear their cries. However, other than that, I don't believe that "Night Shop" will bring better guidance to the audience. "Night Shop" exposes the life of hell, but it does not tell us why they have to live so pitifully. As Mr. Shi Tuo said, since Night Shop is a corner of society, then regrettably, why is the Night Shop only like an independent society? Losing the connection between the society of "Night Shop" and the society that created "Night Shop," so that "Night Shop" only brings us a vague impression.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the plot of "Night Shop" seems too dull and monotonous, and the climax is not tense enough. Danny's interpretation of Sai Guanyin is still good, but the lines are too fast and not clear enough. Zhang Fa's Yang Qilang has too light a rogue spirit, and Ding Shan's Wen Taishi is very appropriate in his sinister nature.</p>
<p>Weekly Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Soul Journey in Dreams</h3>
<p>— Huang Hua</p>
<p>Passage to Marseille</p>
<p>(Nanjing screening)</p>
<p>This is a wartime production of Warner Bros. Most of the plot takes place on a French liner sailing in the Atlantic. Free France and the Vichy puppet regime are the main points of contention in the play. The development of political disputes erupts into a naval and air battle, with a very strong atmosphere of artillery fire, especially with the cooperation of several famous actors, it is even more masterful. The intensity is simply raging like fire. The protagonist is Humphrye Bogart. His acting skills have improved to the point of perfection in recent years and he has won the title of movie emperor. Co-stars such as Claude Rains and horror star Peter Lorre are all top choices. The entire play uses flashbacks. The five dying people who were rescued from floating on the sea tell the story of their past adventures. They are all patriots of Free France. They and the captain agree to change course to London and no longer carry supplies back to Marseille to support the enemy puppets. This leads to a frontal artillery battle with Major Du, who is armed, followed by a tense climax of a lone boat fighting a single plane. And these stories are told by the French captain at the American air base, which can be said to be the ultimate in flashbacks. It is inevitable that viewers who do not understand English dialogue will feel confused. There is only one female character in the entire play, and the love scenes are very simple. The director focuses on the handling of scenes such as fighting, imprisonment, and escape. He exposes the cruelty and perversity of the Vichy puppet government, which sets off the strong will of the French patriotic people. The skillful handling of tense scenes is the characteristic of this film's director, and the existence of "Free Government" and "Vichy Puppet Government" in France is similar to the wartime phenomenon in China. After watching it, it is especially thought-provoking. As for this film, in terms of performance and in all aspects, it is worthy of being a masterpiece that deserves serious recommendation.</p>

<p>(5) "Madame Curie" Madame Curie, starring Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon.</p>

<p>(10) "Random Harvest" Randam Harvest, the story is based on the novel by James Hilton, starring Colman and Greer Garson.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Bai Yang</p>
<p>It has been eight years since I left Shanghai. When I got off the plane, Shanghai was still so prosperous and so complete. It seemed that the war had given it special treatment and did not cause any damage to it. I don't know whether it is joy or sadness in my heart. This reunion gives me a general feeling that I can't express.</p>
<p>For eight years in the rear, most of the time was spent in the capital, which was shrouded in thick fog. There, everything was simple, poor, and inconvenient; especially in the theater, it was simply simple to the point of having nothing. In that environment, I have been following many friends and have been struggling for eight years. Looking back, it's like a dream!</p>
<p>Now that I am back in Shanghai, we will have an excellent working environment. I hope to quickly get to know the friends who have been sticking to their posts under the oppression of the enemy and puppets for many years, and I hope that the drama people who are stranded in the rear will come to Shanghai quickly. We will unite the front and rear and work together for our drama!</p>

<h3>Shirley Temple's Marriage</h3>
<p>Shirley Temple, the child star who was famous in the film industry before the war, is now a graceful young woman. She is eighteen years old. According to the Chinese calendar, she is already a nineteen-year-old girl. American girls all have romances, let alone Alan, who is both beautiful and rich. If she doesn't cause a stir, she doesn't. Once she causes a stir, she hits the jackpot. It can also be said that she is an expert in the crash course. Her target is Sergeant John, a U.S. Air Force sergeant who is six feet two inches tall (of course it is John, how many Americans are not called John). His name is George Agar. This Agar guy is really a lucky guy. He is really blessed with beauty. They are officially engaged. However, according to the spokesperson of the woman's family (Shirley's parents), "Alan and Agar have signed a gentleman's agreement, deciding not to marry within two years, so that both parties can stand on their positions and pursue their own careers," and so on. I hereby announce the above.</p>
<h3>"Mussolini" Divorce News</h3>
<p>Jacques Auclair, the comedic star who played Mussolini in "The Great Dictator," has long been called Mussolini by people in Hollywood. At first, he was very happy that people called him by this name, but since Mussolini was hanged, old Jacques felt terrified and had no appetite. Presumably, Mussolini's ghost was haunting him all the time. (Why doesn't he buy some ingots and burn them? Really—) Recently, he suddenly had a whim and divorced his wife of nine years (who is also an actress). I remember that they got married on a train back then, which was once a story told by Americans.</p>

<h3>Quitting Smoking is a Major Social Problem. Requesting this Column to Publish Common Sense on Quitting Smoking to Guide Blacklisted Smokers Through the Maze</h3>
<p>A letter from our reader Xi Liyan reads: "Editor, the enemy puppets implemented a poisoning policy during the war, openly selling and consuming opium and heroin, resulting in countless people becoming addicted to drugs. After the victory, smoking bans have long been announced, and smokers in Shanghai are limited to quitting by the end of February next year. Those who fail to quit by the deadline will be severely punished according to law. The government strictly prohibits it, and smokers must quit. But smokers who have gone astray and become addicted unknowingly suffer from economic oppression and mental pain. Everyone wants to extricate themselves and quit at all times, but there are more failures than successes. The advertisements for so-called smoking cessation hospitals: 'Three days to break the addiction, comfortable and painless,' are all lies. Many people cannot withstand the pain of quitting and give up halfway. Because the problem of quitting smoking is a major social problem, I specifically request your column to publish several articles of the 'Common Sense on Quitting Smoking' type to guide blacklisted smokers through the maze. It would be best to have an 'Worry-Free Theory of Quitting Smoking' like the 'Anti-Tuberculosis Lecture,' I think it will definitely be of great help to smokers who are about to reform. I wish you a smooth writing."</p>
<p>(Editor's note) Mr. Xi's opinion is very good, and he is indeed a person with good intentions. We hope that readers with smoking cessation experience will write some experiences to share with their peers. We also welcome medical experts to contribute some practical and effective methods for quitting smoking. As far as I know, the first thing to quitting smoking is "determination." If you quit and smoke again, no matter what effective medicine you have, you will never quit. Pay attention!</p>
<h3>Poor and Sick Students Please Establish a Sanatorium for Lung Diseases</h3>
<p>Allocate Received Materials</p>
<p>To Cover Medical Equipment Costs</p>
<p>I am a young man from a bandit area in northern Jiangsu. I was originally studying at the Jiangsu Provincial Temporary Middle School in Tunxi, Anhui, but I recently stopped school and came to Shanghai due to coughing up blood. After arriving in Shanghai, I lived with a relative and borrowed some money to have an X-ray taken. According to the doctor, "It is mild tuberculosis, and it will slowly get better with only six months in the hospital." But we have been wandering for several years, and even eating is a problem. How can we think about staying in the hospital? So now I feel that the only way out is death.</p>
<p>Editor, I think you will definitely sympathize with people like us. In the rear and in schools in the southeast, there are many patients with lung diseases. In our school alone, there are more than 20 people who urgently need treatment. But they all have no money and can only wait for the arrival of the god of death. Our country needs talents to build the country. Can we just watch this group of loyal and pure young people who have moved around with the government die in vain?</p>
<p>I think the government authorities will not abandon the young people. Presumably, because there are many things to be done, they have not taken care of this. In the newspapers in the rear, I saw that Councilor X once suggested the universal establishment of sanatoriums to provide reasonable treatment for teachers and students in the academic world who are suffering from illness. However, the material conditions were not sufficient at that time, and it was not implemented. I think that today, after the victory, with the accumulation of received materials, it would not be a problem to allocate a portion to purchase medicines and medical equipment! Moreover, there are many enemy military hospitals, which are also suitable for conversion into sanatoriums. If the government does this, the people will definitely welcome it, and it can also preserve these main forces for future national construction—the youth.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, this is the call of all poor and sick young people. Please use a corner of your newspaper to disclose it. I think the wise government will definitely consider the situation and adopt public opinion.</p>

<h3>Modern Health Preservation Methods</h3>
<p>— Fudingbao</p>
<p>Based on my observations of human longevity, I have determined that the reasons why people's lifespans are shortened are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Worrying for one hour can shorten your lifespan by one day to six months.</p>
<p>(2) Fear and anger for one hour can shorten your lifespan by three days to one year.</p>
<p>(3) Getting sick once can shorten your lifespan by six days to five years.</p>
<p>(4) Grief for one hour can shorten your lifespan by three days to one year.</p>
<p>(5) One night of insomnia shortens your lifespan by five days.</p>
<p>(6) One ejaculation shortens your lifespan by ten days.</p>
<p>(7) Overindulgence once shortens your lifespan by fifteen days.</p>
<p>(8) Overworking for one day shortens your lifespan by two days.</p>
<p>(9) Breathing in polluted air for one day can shorten your lifespan by one day to one year.</p>
<p>Based on this, we know that we should try our best to avoid the above nine points, which can be a method of health preservation.</p>
