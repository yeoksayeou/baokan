<h3>馬尼刺東方地區　日新銳部隊出擊　巴西克河岸刻尚在激戰中</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日大本營十九日下午三時半發表：（一）日軍有力部隊，二月十四日自罵尼刺東方地區向進攻馬尼刺市中之敵軍主力側背出擊，該市之日軍守備隊，亦予以策應，而展開激戰。（二）敵軍各一部，二月十五日於巴打半島上陸，十六日於克來希德爾上陸，陸續增强兵力，日軍所在部隊，刻正與其激戰中。</p>
<p>呂宋前綫十九日中央社電　堅守馬尼刺市歷時二週餘之日陸海守備部隊，獲悉日軍新銳部隊自馬尼刺東北方開始反攻訊後，士無愈益旺盛，積極展開攻勢。刻馬尼刺市內巷戰，依然以自巴西克河南岸至巴塞間之貫通市內之大東亞街爲中心，目前正展開拉鋸戰中。十五日，日軍在某中尉之指導下，組成擁有相當兵力之突擊隊，深入敵陳，於大東亞街北方，與敵軍展開白刃戰，將之完全擊退，尾追至巴西克岸，刻尙在激戰中。又馬尼刺南部巴塞地區敵軍，以運動塲爲中心，於海岸一帶陸續增强兵力，時以戰車，裝甲車攻擊日軍陣地，然經日陸海軍守備部隊奮勇邀擊，不分晝夜，敢行與敵肉搏，故敵人毫無進展。</p>
<p>菲律賓十九日中央社電　日海軍陸戰隊，於巴西克河連日奮戰，十五日晚，其一部携手榴彈及其他利器，壯烈衝入敵陣，數處炸壞，並擊破擱淺戰車六輛，殺傷美兵三百餘名，奏凱而歸。</p>
<h3>硫磺島登陸敵　日軍邀擊中　三日來敵艦損害重大</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　硫磺島周邊之敵機動部隊，十八日依然繼續猛烈砲擊，幷轟炸日軍陣地，是日上午六時至下午五時，配置戰艦二艘該島南方海面，作熾烈之直射砲擊。此外，敵巡洋艦數艘，亦接近南方海岸，一方橫行，一方砲擊日軍陳地，同時，敵巡洋艦數艘，亦曾對該烏西部及東北部繼行緩慢之砲擊。又是日敵機雖行仔細偵察該島，十九日早曉終於展開熾烈之砲擊與轟炸，同時幷以登陸舟艇的三百艘，分成三批，而於該島南方之二根濱海島岸開始登陸，日軍硫磺島守備隊，在十六·十七·十八·三日間之敵方砲擊轟炸下，曾予敵艦以大損害，四度擊退敵軍登陸之企圖，刻正對豫料中之敵軍整陸部隊展開邀學，士氣激昻，從事激戰中。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　硫磺島南方海面之敵機動部隊，至十九日上午八時頃，以登陸用舟艇約一百艘，接近該島西南部二根濱海岸，日軍守備部隊刻正對之邀擊，展開激戰。敵軍更繼續由第二·第三所編成之登陸用舟艇各一百艘來犯，日軍耶起邀擊，加以猛烈反攻。</p>
<p>敵　戰機襲日擊落四分之一</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日軍制空部隊，對十七日來襲日本土之敵機動部隊艦載機，果敢激戰之結果，業由大本營發表，擊落絡擊毀敵機共達一百二十九架。又十六日邀繫戰果中，追加擊落二七架，是以兩日擊落敵機數實達二百七十五架。又兩日中繫毀者爲七十九架，如預料其中半數不能飛返母艦，則又有三十餘架墜落洋中。此次出擊之敵機動部隊，大體係由制式空母十艘左右及巡洋艦改裝空母五艘所編成，此航空集團之艦載機數，估計爲一千一百架，一千二百架前後，日軍兩次激戰載果，其擊落比例約爲百分之二十八，至少擊落其四分之一。該機動部隊於受此重創後，似即退至小笠原羣島方面，然對硫磺島繼續砲擊及轟炸。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>疏散學校問題</h3>
<p>疏散人口是本市在當前現實環境下最迫切的工作之一，而疏故人口之中，我們認爲允須特別注意於疏散學校。可是，本市一般學校當局也許對於學校疏散問題抱具觀望態度，其所持理由不外是：（一）上海文化水準較高，學生容易深造；（二）敎授人材容易羅致；（三）學校設備較完善，敎學工作方便；（四）各學校在上海多已有基礎，不能隨便拋棄；（五）異鄉人地生疏，很難重起爐灶；（六）疏散將造成不少人的失學。</p>
<p>上述幾種理由，雖然不能完全抹煞，但是，現在是非常時期，非常時期的利害須權宜輕重。爲了適應環境的必需，有些地方也祗好忍受一些了。何况，有利常有弊，上海地方雖說文化程度較高，但浮奢，虛僞，囂張等等的惡習慣，上海達比其他地方深而廣，上海學生的怠學和墮落的人數，歷來就很多。所以就生活環境和道德環境來說，上海木非最理想的辦學之地，早應該擇地設敎。我國敎育改革，有四十幾年歷史，竟無一點滿意的成績可言，除去政治上的原因外，辦學者未能有還大的理想和計劃，把教育當作商業看，成爲個人利害的一部份，而不能適應時勢，獨具慧眼，從艱苦去創造適合國家民族復興所需要的新教育環境，也並非不是其中原因之一。</p>
<p>至於設備，除基干與接術敎育有關的專門學校外，我們覺得一般學校並無特別考慮不切實際的設備之必要。基礎方面，放棄上海原有基礎固然可惜，然而一切都是根據創造的，祇要大家肯苦幹實幹，縱使在人地生疏的異鄉，也未必不可以創造新天地。而目學校分散於各地之後，不僅在現在，並在戰後，允可收得發展敎育普及敎育之效。大多數學校都集中於一　，木來不是健全的國民敎育所應有。又所謂疏散將造成不少人的失學，其實隨同本校疏散者原無問題，其他也儘可設法擇地改學。</p>
<p>根據上述，我們認爲學校當局必須考慮未來環境的危機，而不能斤於目前的便利，希望上海現有許多大學及專門學校，首應從速擇地遷移，如果可以合併的，二個以上的學校併起來合遷一處，如此可以節省人力財力物力，同時因爲學校合併後，敎授人才更無問題，且可因此減去敎授兼職，跋涉於途，無暇預備敎材之苦。中學生和小學生，除可能擇地遷移的中學，學生得隨學校一同疏散外，其他中學生和一般小學生似可隨同家長疏散而移動，即在當地就學。必要時在各地不妨設置補習學校，以便安乃插無校可進的學生。</p>
<p>不過疏散學校的實行，尙有待於政府當局的積極支援，尤其交通運輸方面，政府更非作切實幫助不可，專門畢校必需帶走的設備工具，尤宜給予搬運上的便利。同時，在經濟上也應該酌量予以接濟。又各地當局，對於上海學校的遷移，也必須盡一切力量給與協助，庶幾疏散學校工作得以順利完成。</p>
<h3>日政府設置　物價審議會</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日本政府爲確保戰時經濟計劃之運營，曾於一月十九日閣議決定設立戰時物價審議會，以總理大臣小磯國昭爲會長，大藏大臣石渡莊太郎任副會長，十九日己由官報公佈實施，此次設立內閣物價審議會之目的，在抑止最近物價之騰漲。</p>
<h3>美人眼中的重慶　美情報局「關於重慶的官方報告」摘要</h3>
<p>美國戰時情報局最近在報上曾發表「關於重慶的官方報告」，以　足亟欲瞭解重慶現狀的美國會論界。該報告內容共分三部，卽重慶內政，各種黨派，經濟情况。又於今年一月十五，十六，十七日接連三天，由電台向重慶廣播。此舉的目的以中國大陸爲中心的日美決戰，決非易事，美國一一還有更大的犧牲，所以羅斯福想藉此廣播來向本國人民宣傳，求其瞭解政府曾對重慶作過極大援助。其中令人注目者，就是美國對重慶的態度及帝國主義的侵略野心。現譯載其要旨如下：</p>
<p>一般形勢</p>
<p>重慶抗戰業已有七年之久，工業，鐵路以及運輸網，已經喪失了八成之多。國外輸入，除靠空路外，別無辦法。奈爾遜會說：「重慶的形勢，固然非常嚴重，但決非絕望。重慶必須在生產戰上取得勝利，所以在第一個階段上，業已由美國和重慶兩國開始了」。這就是表示由美國援助物資的困難。運輸，因爲載重汽車補充的困難，只好依靠駄運及挑夫勉强維持。重慶可用的載重汽車，至多不過六千輛，其最新者，也無非是三年前之舊物。美國正在努力使其飛躍增加。</p>
<p>十一月要運昆明的物資，雖達三萬噸之多，但因交通工具不足，而只分配了十分之七。</p>
<p>所謂民主</p>
<p>美國政府希望，並相信是有處理重慶內政的能力。美國所期待於重慶者，就是重慶必須發展成爲精誠團結及民主進步的政府。目前因爲訓政時期，重慶仍然實行着一黨獨裁的政體，固然在蒙受各方面的指摘非難，但重慶也有一點微乎其微的民主現象。例如最近蔣家政府會對於這一點，作過虛應故事式的聲明。</p>
<p>例如蔣介石在參政會上不得不聲明，過去一再拖延的保護人權及生命法，不得不在表面上允許了廣大人民的要求·始終不願大政交還於民的蔣介石，也不能不陽奉陰違地說應當早日實現憲政了。過去政府的預算，想法瞳國民黨私人的家賬一樣，從未向人民公開過，但現在不管他們怎樣報假賬，總算許可參政會有權審議預算了；原來國民黨一手包辦的參政會員，第四屆參政會竟由二百四十人增加到二百九十人了。曾一度停止或嚴格限制派往外國留學的辦法，也比以前放寬尺度了。重慶道類民主表示，美國是表示歡迎的。</p>
<p>黨派糾紛</p>
<p>蔣介石雖在第三屆參政會上會强調調國內統一的重要，但在該屆參政會上，却第一次准許延安政權有發言權。按重慶的意見說，就是重慶國民黨業巳同意延安共產黨的初步要求了，但後來在參政會內中共曾提出下列合作辦法。</p>
<p>第一，重慶承認陝甘寗邊區有通貨發行權，重慶承認行政權。根據這一承認，求在日本軍隊佔領區內，收復的十二個區域，中共應有支配權。第二，重慶說在將來實行憲政後，將承認共產黨以及其他各黨各派，全有合法的平等地位。延安則不接受國民黨三番五次所拖延下去的憲政，而要求重慶國民黨政府卽時實行憲政，准許各黨各派參加聯合政府，取消一人或數人私有的統治制度。第三，重慶口頭上承認延安可擁有十師兵力，並供給與重慶軍隊相等的裝備及待遇，同時重慶要求延安軍隊服從軍事委員會的命令。延安則要求重慶供給十六師的中共軍隊以軍火及食糧。</p>
<p>這是參政會上雙方所提出來的意見。於是參政會就決定派調查團前往延安視察。此外還有所謂「民主政團大同盟」的民主政黨，這是應當加以硏究的。參加這一民主政團大同盟的，除了國共兩黨外，其他小黨派全都參加了，例如其中有靑年黨，國家社會黨，第三黨，救國會派，國訊社等。這批政黨，全都大聲疾呼地主張廢棄個人獨裁，建立民主政府，取消軍人干政，實行國內統一。</p>
<p>滿洲及華北，由於自然資源豐富以及發展的迅速，業巳成爲重要地區。華南根本是農業地帶，而缺乏發展工業的必要資源。所以此二地帶如不能統一於一個政機下，則中國決難成爲亞洲的安定勢力，則決難發揮美國所希望的强力性。美國決不偏袒重慶或延安，我們美國的態度，主要是擁護抗日的政府。蔣介石是重慶政府的主權者，因爲他仍然努力於對日抗戰工作，所以美國政府就用物資來援助他。</p>
<p>物資援助</p>
<p>美國進行反日戰爭的最大貢獻，就是太平洋作戰。這一作戰，目的在開放中國大陸的門戶。美國擁有三師團的美國化重慶軍隊，派往湎甸作戰。這是左印度訓練的軍隊，它有美國化的最新裝備。但在怒江作戰的重慶軍隊，曾受過半美國化的訓練，具有半美國化的裝備。在美國的桑達伯爾德飛機塲訓練重慶飛行師，他們回重慶時，則駕駛美國所供給的P40型和B24型飛歸重慶。此外美國對重慶的援助計劃，主要可分下列四項。　一，擴充重慶地區的航空路綫，供給中國航空公司以四引擎運輸機，取消前此的雙引擎道格拉斯運輸機。</p>
<p>二，建設萊多公路，每日利用此路供給重慶一萬至一萬五千噸物資，同時敷設四條汽油管直達重慶。</p>
<p>三，成立擁有五百架轟炸機的第十四航空部隊。</p>
<p>四，訓練重慶空軍，積極改善渝軍裝備。</p>
<p>此外還有軍事專家在技術方面的援助，以及經濟產業方面的援助等。美國一俟運輸路完成，則向重慶供給必要武器，但目前因交通不便，受到莫大的限制。最大的困難，卽載重汽車不足。去年重慶會投資一千二百萬金元，舖成數百英里以上的公路，然而全被日本所佔領了。</p>
<p>根據道種形勢來看重慶的經濟狀况，則可證明下列三點：</p>
<p>第一，重慶業已喪失工業地帶，主要業已喪失交通網和資源。第二，重慶處於日軍嚴重的封鎖下。第三，重慶實行統制經濟非常困難。重慶領域內的人民，正深陷於惡性通貨膨脹裏，但抗戰經濟便由通貨膨脹來支持。正如奈爾遜所說，中國並非絕望。人民增加生產的熱忱與軍心士氣，是決定軍隊勝利的因素。（方譯自一月二十七日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>柏林十九日中央社電　加第一軍及第二軍，不顧前數日所受之挫敗，於星期五六兩日在多數之飛機坦克車掩護下，及數小時之大砲猛轟後，加緊其突破企圖，故西綫反軸心軍大攻勢之前奏，可認爲業已開始。其主要之攻擊區域，當爲以前之突進區，當此攻擊之重任者乃美第九軍。該軍最近已獲得大量大砲及坦克車之增援，前綫砲火日夜不息，斥堠活動已發展爲强力之偵察作戰，此克里米亞會議中斯達林所規定之英美軍攻勢之日期，必已迫在眉睫。</p>
<h3>特戈爾拒絕　會晤羅斯福</h3>
<p>馬德里十九日中央社電外傳美總統羅斯福於三頭會談後，擬在阿爾及爾與特戈爾會談，遭特戈爾拒絕，此項消息爲歐洲外交界捲起一大波浪。據巴黎電訊，法政府關於招待及拒絕之事，絕對保守秘密，終被美大使館方面洩認，法方至感不快。當初在阿爾及爾時代，特戈爾曾有意訪美而橫遭拒絕，尤其最近美法間交涉武器貸與法案，結果未能圓滿，邇來召集三頭愈談時，法國擬參加，又未得許可，以致法國對英美感情極度惡化。羅斯福於去秋曾允諾特戈爾招請訪問巴黎之舉，此次訪問歐洲，於三國會談歸途經過凡爾賽港，不至巴黎，反而要求在阿爾及爾會晤，致使特戈爾之多年不滿一旦爆發。</p>
<p>日內瓦十九日中央社電　德國社訊，據路透社駐法特派員種：羅斯福總統近曾由美大使轉致特戈爾秘密備忘錄一件，詳告雅爾太會議之內容，而特別着重於舊金山會議之組織，據稱，法將爲被激參加舊金山會議之一。</p>

<h3>蘇軍佈蛇陣　準備大決戰　德軍亦完成邀擊敗態勢</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　據前線消息：東線現在可分爲下列四戰區：（一）東普魯士之蘇軍强行包圍作戰，欲排除德軍橋頭堡，反復出擊。（二）西普魯士蘇軍，欲圖遮斷但澤市。（三）沃特河灣曲部格林比爾克區，蘇軍欲圖威脅薩克玖之工業地帶。（四）布萊斯勞要塞攻防戰，僅爲初期戰。以上戰鬥之本身固極重要，自不待言，亦係未來大決戰之準備階段，此大決戰之初期象徵，已出現於法籣克福與庫斯特林西北方之沃特河突出部，蘇軍部隊之長蛇陣，陸續向參加首都突破作戰之部隊結集處前進，同時德軍司令部亦以龐大之中央戰略預備，完成邀擊陣勢後，以空軍向蘇軍之集結點痛擊，沃特河西岸之小橋頭堡，已成爲蘇軍將士之共同墳墓，預料德軍最大之決戰，數日內即將開始</p>
<p>西里西亞展開惡戰</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍哥尼夫元帥企圖突破德軍在波柏河與薩根間之陣地，已被德軍反攻，並將其缺口堵合。同時蘇軍企圖在波柏河與奎斯河間突破亦被阻，布萊斯勞之南亦發生惡戰，此外在彭斯勞與勞本之間，及索勞與薩根之間，戰事亦極猛烈。在克洛森城之西南，波柏河之西岸，亦在劇戰中。</p>

<h3>電力供給必須合理</h3>
<p>本市電力供給，因爲煤斤來源减少，一財限制。最近更有電力公司公吿，規定每晚七時至十時爲供電時間。可是事實上並不如此，譬如舊一區與奮八區供電時間不一，有時延長時間有時縮短時間，有時終日夜無電，有時終日夜有電，（昨日自晨七時至晚二時執筆時止舊一區一般用戶均供電）這種紛歧的現象，完全是供電方面自亂步聚。</p>
<p>旣然幾定每晚供電三小時，爲什麼忽而减忽而多，這是不可理解的。如果因爲煤斤缺乏而減少供電，那末，根本不應該再有整日夜供電的可能，縱使臨時有此供給力量，也應積儲備用。今天有了煤就可以多用，明天沒有煤就可以停用，這種浪子作風，公用事業絕對不應有的。就從電力公司公吿的信譽而言，也不應有忽多忽少的現象，減低市民的信仰。</p>
<p>最後，我們還是主張在每個月中月亮的時期，應將路燈臨時熄減，也可節約電力，而另方面，如工廠醫院等必需生產及社會公益事業，不能與一般用戶同樣供給。總而言之，希望一般用戶節省，電力公司應首先做到有計顯的節省。電力供給，必須達到最合理的分配。</p>

<h3>Manila Eastern District: Japanese Elite Troops Launch Attack; Fierce Fighting Still Raging on the Banks of the Pasig River</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 19th: (1) On February 14th, powerful Japanese forces launched an attack from the eastern district of Manila against the enemy's main forces in Manila, with the Japanese garrison in the city also providing support, resulting in fierce fighting. (2) Enemy units landed on the Bataan Peninsula on February 15th and at Calaguas on February 16th, continuously increasing their forces. Japanese troops stationed in the area are currently engaged in fierce combat with them.</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 19th (Central News Agency): The Japanese army and naval garrison forces, having held Manila for over two weeks, learned that new Japanese elite troops had begun a counteroffensive from the northeast of Manila. Morale was exceptionally high, and they actively launched offensives. At present, the street fighting within Manila remains centered on Great East Asia Street, which runs through the city from the south bank of the Pasig River to Paco, with a seesaw battle underway. On the 15th, under the guidance of a certain Japanese lieutenant, a strike force with considerable strength penetrated the enemy's lines and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with enemy forces north of Great East Asia Street, completely repelling them and pursuing them to the Pasig River bank, where fierce fighting is still raging. Furthermore, enemy forces in the Paco area of southern Manila are continuously increasing their forces centered on the sports field along the coast, using tanks and armored vehicles to attack Japanese positions. However, after the brave resistance of the Japanese army and naval garrison forces, who engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy day and night, the enemy has made no progress.</p>
<p>Philippines, 19th (Central News Agency): Japanese naval infantry fought valiantly on the Pasig River for days. On the night of the 15th, a unit bravely charged into enemy lines with hand grenades and other weapons, destroying several positions and destroying six grounded tanks, killing or wounding over 300 American soldiers, and returning victoriously.</p>
<h3>Enemy Landings on Iwo Jima; Japanese Forces Counterattack; Enemy Ships Sustain Heavy Damage in Three Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): Enemy mobile forces around Iwo Jima continued their intense bombardment and bombing of Japanese positions on the 18th. From 6:00 AM to 5:00 PM that day, two battleships positioned off the southern coast of the island conducted fierce direct fire. In addition, several enemy cruisers also approached the southern coast, sailing back and forth and bombarding Japanese positions. At the same time, several enemy cruisers also conducted slow bombardment of the western and northeastern parts of the island. Also on that day, enemy aircraft conducted detailed reconnaissance of the island. At dawn on the 19th, they finally launched intense bombardment and bombing, and simultaneously, 300 landing craft, divided into three groups, began landing on the two beaches south of the island. The Japanese Iwo Jima garrison, under enemy bombardment and bombing for three days (16th, 17th, and 18th), inflicted heavy damage on enemy ships and repelled enemy landing attempts four times. They are now launching a counterattack against the enemy's expected landing forces, with high morale and engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): Enemy mobile forces off the southern coast of Iwo Jima, around 8:00 AM on the 19th, approached the southwestern Ni Genhama coast of the island with about 100 landing craft. The Japanese garrison forces are currently counterattacking them and engaged in fierce fighting. The enemy forces continue to send 100 landing craft each from the second and third formations, and the Japanese forces are fiercely counterattacking.</p>
<p>Enemy Warplanes Attack Japan, One-Quarter Shot Down</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency): As a result of the Japanese air defense forces' courageous and fierce fighting against enemy mobile fleet-based aircraft that attacked the Japanese mainland on the 17th, the General Headquarters announced that a total of 129 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed. In addition, 27 more shot down were added to the results of the engagement on the 16th, bringing the total number of enemy aircraft shot down in the two days to 275. Also, 79 were damaged in the two days. If, as expected, half of them cannot return to their mother ships, then more than 30 will have crashed into the ocean. The enemy mobile forces that launched this attack are generally composed of about ten standard aircraft carriers and five cruisers converted into aircraft carriers. The number of carrier-based aircraft in this air group is estimated to be around 1,100 to 1,200. The Japanese forces' two fierce battles resulted in a shoot-down ratio of about 28 percent, or at least one-quarter. After suffering this heavy blow, the mobile forces appear to have retreated to the Ogasawara Islands area, but continued to bombard and bomb Iwo Jima.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Issue of Evacuating Schools</h3>
<p>Evacuating the population is one of the most urgent tasks for this city under the current realistic circumstances. Among the evacuated population, we believe that special attention must be paid to evacuating schools. However, the authorities of general schools in this city may be taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the issue of school evacuation. The reasons they hold are nothing more than: (1) Shanghai has a higher cultural level, and students can easily pursue further studies; (2) Professors and talents are easily recruited; (3) School equipment is more complete, and teaching work is convenient; (4) Various schools in Shanghai already have a foundation and cannot be easily abandoned; (5) It is difficult to start over in a strange land; (6) Evacuation will cause many people to lose their schooling.</p>
<p>Although the above reasons cannot be completely ignored, now is an extraordinary period, and the pros and cons of an extraordinary period must be weighed. In order to adapt to the needs of the environment, some places also have to endure some. Besides, there are always pros and cons. Although Shanghai is said to have a higher cultural level, bad habits such as extravagance, hypocrisy, and arrogance are deeper and wider in Shanghai than in other places. The number of students who are lazy and degenerate has always been large. Therefore, in terms of living environment and moral environment, Shanghai is not the most ideal place to run a school, and it should have chosen a place to establish education long ago. My country's education reform has a history of more than 40 years, but there is no satisfactory achievement at all. In addition to political reasons, the educators have failed to have great ideals and plans, treat education as a business, become a part of personal interests, and fail to adapt to the times, have unique insights, and create a new educational environment suitable for the revival of the country and nation from hardships, which is also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>As for equipment, except for specialized schools related to base and technical education, we feel that general schools do not need to consider impractical equipment. In terms of foundation, it is certainly a pity to abandon the original foundation in Shanghai. However, everything is based on creation. As long as everyone is willing to work hard and practically, even in a strange land, it is not necessarily impossible to create a new world. After the schools are scattered in various places, they can not only achieve the effect of developing and popularizing education now, but also after the war. Most schools are concentrated in one place, which is not what a healthy national education should have. In addition, the so-called evacuation will cause many people to lose their schooling. In fact, there is no problem for those who evacuate with the school, and others can also find ways to choose a place to change schools.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we believe that school authorities must consider the crisis of the future environment and cannot be limited to the convenience of the present. We hope that many universities and specialized schools in Shanghai should choose a place to move as soon as possible. If they can merge, two or more schools can merge and move to one place, which can save manpower, financial resources, and materials. At the same time, because professors are no longer a problem after the schools merge, and they can also reduce the hardship of professors holding concurrent positions, traveling on the road, and having no time to prepare teaching materials. For middle school students and elementary school students, except for middle schools that can choose a place to move, students can evacuate with the school. Other middle school students and general elementary school students can move with their parents and go to school locally. If necessary, supplementary schools may be set up in various places to accommodate students who have no schools to enter.</p>
<p>However, the implementation of school evacuation still depends on the active support of the government authorities, especially in terms of transportation. The government must provide practical help. Special equipment and tools that must be taken away from vocational schools should be given convenience in transportation. At the same time, financial assistance should also be given as appropriate. In addition, the local authorities in various places must do everything possible to assist the relocation of Shanghai schools, so that the school evacuation work can be successfully completed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Establishes Price Deliberation Council</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): In order to ensure the operation of the wartime economic plan, the Japanese government decided at a cabinet meeting on January 19 to establish a Wartime Price Deliberation Council, with Prime Minister Koiso Kuniaki as chairman and Finance Minister Ishiwata Sotaro as vice-chairman. It was officially announced and implemented by the official gazette on the 19th. The purpose of establishing the cabinet price deliberation council this time is to suppress the recent rise in prices.</p>
<h3>Chongqing in the Eyes of Americans: Excerpts from the U.S. Intelligence Agency's "Official Report on Chongqing"</h3>
<p>The U.S. Wartime Information Agency recently published an "Official Report on Chongqing" in the newspaper, in order to satisfy the American congressional circles who are eager to understand the current situation in Chongqing. The report is divided into three parts: Chongqing's internal affairs, various parties, and economic situation. It was broadcast to Chongqing by radio for three consecutive days on January 15, 16, and 17 this year. The purpose of this move is that the decisive battle between Japan and the United States centered on mainland China is by no means easy. The United States still has greater sacrifices to make, so Roosevelt wants to use this broadcast to publicize to his people and ask them to understand that the government has provided great assistance to Chongqing. What is noteworthy is the attitude of the United States towards Chongqing and the imperialist ambitions of aggression. The main points are translated as follows:</p>
<p>General Situation</p>
<p>Chongqing has been resisting Japan for seven years. Most of its industries, railways, and transportation networks have been lost. Foreign imports can only rely on air routes. Nelson said, "The situation in Chongqing is certainly very serious, but it is by no means hopeless. Chongqing must win in the production war, so in the first stage, it has been started by the United States and Chongqing." This indicates the difficulty of the United States providing material assistance. Due to the difficulty of replenishing trucks, transportation can only rely on mules and porters to barely maintain. Chongqing has at most 6,000 trucks available, and the newest are no more than three years old. The United States is working hard to increase it dramatically.</p>
<p>Although as many as 30,000 tons of materials were to be transported to Kunming in November, only 70% was allocated due to insufficient transportation.</p>
<p>So-called Democracy</p>
<p>The U.S. government hopes and believes that it has the ability to handle Chongqing's internal affairs. What the United States expects from Chongqing is that Chongqing must develop into a government of unity and democratic progress. Currently, because of the period of political tutelage, Chongqing is still practicing a one-party dictatorship, which is certainly being criticized from all sides, but Chongqing also has a little bit of democracy. For example, recently the Chiang Kai-shek government has made a perfunctory statement on this point.</p>
<p>For example, Chiang Kai-shek had to declare at the National Political Council that the repeatedly delayed law on the protection of human rights and life had to superficially allow the demands of the vast people. Chiang Kai-shek, who was always unwilling to return the government to the people, had to hypocritically say that constitutional government should be realized as soon as possible. In the past, the government's budget was like the private account of the Kuomintang, and it was never made public to the people, but now, no matter how they report false accounts, the National Political Council is allowed to review the budget. The fourth National Political Council, which was originally monopolized by the Kuomintang, has increased from 240 members to 290. The method of sending students to study abroad, which was once stopped or strictly restricted, has also been relaxed compared to before. The United States welcomes Chongqing's democratic expression.</p>
<p>Party Disputes</p>
<p>Although Chiang Kai-shek emphasized the importance of domestic unity at the third National Political Council, he allowed the Yan'an regime to have the right to speak for the first time at that National Political Council. According to Chongqing's opinion, the Chongqing Kuomintang has agreed to the preliminary requirements of the Yan'an Communist Party, but later the CCP proposed the following cooperation methods in the National Political Council.</p>
<p>First, Chongqing recognizes the right of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to issue currency and recognizes administrative power. Based on this recognition, the CCP should have the right to control the 12 areas recovered in the Japanese army-occupied areas. Second, Chongqing said that after the implementation of constitutional government in the future, it will recognize that the Communist Party and other parties have equal legal status. Yan'an does not accept the constitutional government that the Kuomintang has repeatedly delayed, but requires the Chongqing Kuomintang government to implement constitutional government immediately, allow all parties to participate in the coalition government, and abolish the private rule of one person or several people. Third, Chongqing verbally recognizes that Yan'an can have ten divisions of troops and provide equipment and treatment equal to that of the Chongqing army. At the same time, Chongqing requires the Yan'an army to obey the orders of the Military Affairs Commission. Yan'an requires Chongqing to supply the 16 divisions of the CCP army with ammunition and food.</p>
<p>These are the opinions put forward by both sides at the National Political Council. Therefore, the National Political Council decided to send an investigation team to Yan'an for inspection. In addition, there is the so-called "Democratic Political League," which should be studied. In addition to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, all other small parties participated in this democratic political alliance, such as the Youth Party, the National Socialist Party, the Third Party, the National Salvation Association, and the National News Agency. These parties all loudly advocated abolishing personal dictatorship, establishing a democratic government, abolishing military interference in politics, and realizing domestic unity.</p>
<p>Manchuria and North China have become important areas due to their abundant natural resources and rapid development. South China is fundamentally an agricultural area and lacks the necessary resources to develop industry. Therefore, if these two areas cannot be unified under one political machine, it will be difficult for China to become a stable force in Asia and it will be difficult to exert the strong force that the United States hopes for. The United States does not favor Chongqing or Yan'an. Our attitude is mainly to support the anti-Japanese government. Chiang Kai-shek is the sovereign of the Chongqing government, because he is still working hard on the anti-Japanese war, so the U.S. government uses materials to assist him.</p>
<p>Material Assistance</p>
<p>The greatest contribution of the United States to the anti-Japanese war is the Pacific War. The purpose of this war is to open the door to mainland China. The United States has three divisions of Americanized Chongqing troops sent to Burma to fight. This is an army trained in India, and it has the latest Americanized equipment. However, the Chongqing army fighting in the Nujiang River has undergone semi-Americanized training and has semi-Americanized equipment. The Chongqing flying division is trained at the Sanderburg Airfield in the United States. When they return to Chongqing, they will fly back to Chongqing in the P40 and B24 aircraft supplied by the United States. In addition, the U.S. aid plan to Chongqing can be mainly divided into the following four items: 1. Expand the air routes in the Chongqing area, supply the China National Aviation Corporation with four-engine transport aircraft, and cancel the previous twin-engine Douglas transport aircraft.</p>
<p>2. Build the Ledo Road and use this road to supply Chongqing with 10,000 to 15,000 tons of materials every day, and at the same time lay four gasoline pipelines directly to Chongqing.</p>
<p>3. Establish the 14th Air Force with 500 bombers.</p>
<p>4. Train the Chongqing Air Force and actively improve the equipment of the Chongqing army.</p>
<p>In addition, there are military experts in technical assistance and economic and industrial assistance. Once the transportation route is completed, the United States will supply Chongqing with the necessary weapons, but at present it is greatly limited due to inconvenient transportation. The biggest difficulty is the lack of trucks. Last year, Chongqing invested 12 million gold yuan to pave hundreds of miles of roads, but all were occupied by Japan.</p>
<p>Based on this situation, looking at Chongqing's economic situation, it can prove the following three points:</p>
<p>First, Chongqing has lost its industrial areas and has mainly lost its transportation network and resources. Second, Chongqing is under severe blockade by the Japanese army. Third, it is very difficult for Chongqing to implement a controlled economy. The people in Chongqing are deeply mired in hyperinflation, but the anti-Japanese war economy is supported by hyperinflation. As Nelson said, China is not hopeless. The people's enthusiasm for increasing production and the morale of the army are the factors that determine the victory of the army. (Translated by Fang from the Asahi Shimbun on January 27)</p>
<h3>On the Banks of the Irrawaddy River: Japanese Air Force War Results; Fierce Battles Launched by Residents of Ramree Island</h3>
<p>Burma Front Base, 17th (Central News Agency): The Japanese air force has been dispatched for days to cooperate with the brave battles of the army, crushing the enemy's general offensive and achieving great war results.

<h3>Western Front Allied Reinforcements with Ceaseless Artillery Fire: Prelude to a Large-Scale Offensive</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – Despite setbacks in recent days, the Canadian First and Second Armies, under the cover of numerous aircraft and tanks, and after hours of intense artillery bombardment on Friday and Saturday, have intensified their attempts to break through. This can be considered the prelude to a major Allied offensive on the Western Front. The main area of attack is the previous breakthrough zone, with the American Ninth Army bearing the brunt. This army has recently received a large reinforcement of artillery and tanks, and the front-line artillery fire is incessant day and night. Reconnaissance activities have developed into strong probing operations, indicating that the date for the Allied offensive agreed upon by Stalin at the Crimea Conference must be imminent.</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Refuses to Meet Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Madrid, 19th (Central News Agency) – Rumors that President Roosevelt intended to meet with De Gaulle in Algiers after the Three-Power Conference were met with De Gaulle's refusal, causing a major stir in European diplomatic circles. According to a dispatch from Paris, the French government maintained absolute secrecy regarding the invitation and refusal, but this was ultimately leaked by the American Embassy, much to the displeasure of the French. Initially, during the Algiers period, De Gaulle had intended to visit the United States but was rejected. Moreover, recent negotiations between the United States and France regarding the arms lend-lease bill did not conclude satisfactorily. Furthermore, France's request to participate in the recent Three-Power Conference was denied, leading to a significant deterioration in French sentiment towards Britain and the United States. Roosevelt had promised De Gaulle last autumn to arrange a visit to Paris. However, this time, when visiting Europe and passing through Versailles on his way back from the Three-Power Conference, he did not go to Paris but instead requested a meeting in Algiers, causing De Gaulle's years of dissatisfaction to erupt.</p>
<p>Geneva, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to the German news agency, citing a Reuters correspondent in France: President Roosevelt recently sent De Gaulle a secret memorandum through the American Ambassador, detailing the contents of the Yalta Conference and emphasizing the organization of the San Francisco Conference. It is said that France will be invited to participate in the San Francisco Conference.</p>
<h3>Tensions Rise Between Argentina and Germany</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Argentine Foreign Ministry announced on the 27th that relations between Argentina and Germany have become strained due to the arrest and detention of seven Argentine diplomats by Germany.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Deploys in a Snake Formation, Preparing for a Decisive Battle; German Army Also Completes Defensive Posture</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line reports, the Eastern Front can now be divided into the following four theaters: (1) The Soviet army in East Prussia is conducting a forced encirclement operation to eliminate the German bridgehead, launching repeated attacks. (2) The Soviet army in West Prussia aims to cut off Danzig. (3) The Grinbilk area in the Vistula River bend, where the Soviet army aims to threaten the industrial zone of Saxony. (4) The siege and defense of the Breslau fortress is only in its initial stage. While the battles themselves are extremely important, it goes without saying that they are also preparatory stages for a future decisive battle. The initial symbol of this decisive battle has appeared in the Vistula River salient northwest of Frankfurt and Küstrin, where the long snake-like formations of Soviet troops are gradually advancing towards the assembly points for troops participating in the assault on the capital. At the same time, the German command, with its vast central strategic reserve, has completed its defensive posture and is using the air force to strike hard at Soviet assembly points. The small bridgehead on the west bank of the Vistula River has become a common grave for Soviet soldiers. It is expected that the largest German decisive battle will begin within a few days.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Unfolds in Silesia</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – Havas reports: Soviet Marshal Konev's attempt to break through the German defenses between the Bober River and Sagan has been countered by a German offensive, which has closed the gap. At the same time, Soviet attempts to break through between the Bober and Queis Rivers have also been thwarted. Fierce fighting has also broken out south of Breslau. In addition, battles are extremely intense between Penslau and Lauban, and between Sorau and Sagan. Heavy fighting is also taking place southwest of Klosen, on the west bank of the Bober River.</p>
<p>Soviet General Killed in Action</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to a German news agency, citing a TASS broadcast from Moscow: General Chernyakhovsky, commander of the Red Army's Third Belorussian Front, has been killed in action in East Prussia. The report stated that General Chernyakhovsky's death is a loss to the Soviet Union of a most talented young commander.</p>
<h3>Switzerland Freezes German Assets</h3>

<h3>Factories in This City Required to Register by Deadline: Municipal Economic Bureau Issues Registration Methods</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry has long promulgated regulations for factory registration, which all factories should abide by. In recent years, old factories have gradually recovered, and new factories have increased daily, but the number reporting for registration is very small, making it impossible to implement adjustment work. To understand the actual situation of factories in various places, special regulations have been established for factory registration, ordering the competent authorities in various places to urge all factories to complete the application registration procedures as scheduled, before the end of March of this year. Any factories that violate the delay will be severely punished. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau specially copied the attached methods yesterday, ordering the various trade associations to transfer to their member factories to complete the factory registration in accordance with the regulations before the end of March of this year. The methods are recorded below:</p>
<p>Factory Registration Methods</p>
<p>Competent authorities in various places should, within one month of receiving the document, submit the approved factory registration forms to the Ministry for record (those already submitted do not need to be resubmitted). In the future, the registration forms for newly established factories should also be submitted to the Ministry for record at any time. All factories that have been established but have not yet been registered should be ordered to comply with the Factory Registration Rules, and complete the registration within three months from January 1, 1945, to the end of March 1945. The penalty provisions of Article 12 of the Registration Rules are now temporarily exempted from execution to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. If registration is further delayed, the competent authorities in various places shall severely punish them. Newly established factories should apply for registration in accordance with Article 1 of the Factory Registration Rules and should not delay. Violators will be punished in accordance with the regulations and may have their various licenses revoked.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Accounting Office Transferred to Finance Bureau Today, Received by Accounting Section</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government Accounting Office, after being ordered to be abolished, has been actively rushing to complete the handover matters, and most of it has been completed.

It is learned that the affairs of the Fifth Section of the office are within the same scope of jurisdiction as the Treasury Section of the Municipal Finance Bureau, and it was ordered to be merged into that section. Yesterday (19th) at 10:00 AM, the former head of the office, Shen Guanzhun, transferred all the original affairs and valuable securities of the Fifth Section to the head of the Treasury Section, Chen Yunqing, together with Shen Chengqian, a commissioner of the Finance Bureau, for receipt. Zhao Zhijia, an advisor to the Municipal Government, was also sent to supervise the event. Head Chen and others checked and accepted all contracts, receipts, guarantees, valuable securities, bank deposits, documents, reports, vouchers, ledgers, and audit materials one by one.

<h3>Embezzlement of Consumption Special Tax Severely Punished by Finance Bureau: Small Changzhou Noodle Shop Fined Over 4 Million</h3>
<p>The Small Changzhou Noodle Shop, located at the south end of Sichuan Road, specializes in selling pork ribs and noodles, and its business is very prosperous. In October of last year, the former Consumption Special Tax Office heard that the noodle shop had not been truthful in collecting the consumption special tax, and sent someone to investigate. Dong Lingeng, the owner of the noodle shop, fearing the investigation, bribed the investigators. The investigators reported it, and the Special Tax Office notified Dong Lingeng to come to the office for questioning. According to the general ledger he submitted, the total business volume for October was less than 10,000 yuan per day, which was obviously inconsistent with the facts. After further investigation by the office, the net business income from the 14th to the 18th of November was 615,740 yuan, about 120,000 to 130,000 yuan per day, and about 3.7 million yuan for the whole month. The shop had been consistently underreporting its income and embezzling tax money. According to the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Consumption Special Tax of the Ministry of Finance, based on the average food price index for November, the amount was traced back to June of last year, decreasing month by month. Except for the tax money for October and November, which had not been handed over, it was still difficult to determine whether there was embezzlement. In June, July, August, and September, the shop had embezzled 472,698 yuan in tax money. The Special Tax Office, in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Consumption Special Tax of the Ministry of Finance, fined the shop ten times the minimum amount of the embezzled tax, for a total of 4,726,980 yuan, and ordered it to pay back the embezzled tax of 472,698 yuan. Huang Lingeng, the owner of the shop, recently submitted a report to the Finance Bureau, saying that he was unable to pay the money at once. It is said that the Finance Bureau has rejected the application.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Promotes School Hygiene</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau in this city has been promoting school hygiene in various municipal schools. The working principle is to check students' physical condition, treat simple diseases, and guide students to correct physical defects and conduct family visits and health talks. However, in recent times, the living standards in this city have been rising daily. Once they fall ill, the medical expenses alone easily cost tens of thousands, which is indeed difficult for poor parents to bear. This not only affects the health of the students, but also hinders their studies. It is necessary to actively provide relief to maintain their health. The bureau has ordered the relevant departments to carefully formulate expansion plans. From this semester, in addition to continuing to promote the original work in the clinics, free internal medicine treatment will be added, with each doctor responsible. The required medicines will be issued by the Health Bureau, and the cost will be recovered as appropriate. The students' parents will purchase the medicines needed for injections, and the doctors will still provide free injections. Those who need to be hospitalized will be accommodated in the municipal hospitals as much as possible, and special arrangements will be made with the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Jimin Hospital, Fuxing Hospital, etc. Those who hold introduction certificates from the Health Bureau can have a 30% discount. The above plan has been implemented this semester. This measure will not only help the social economy, but also maintain the health of students. It is of great benefit to children. It is also heard that the health authorities will universally promote school health work to all public and private schools in the city, so that all students in the city can enjoy health protection.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Distribution for Registered Households Extended to the 25th</h3>
<p>The distribution of coal balls for registered households in the old First District this period, which started on the 6th of this month, was originally scheduled to end yesterday (19th). Due to the lack of electricity, various factories were unable to rush to manufacture them on schedule. Therefore, it has been extended to the 25th. During this period, citizens in the old First District who have not yet received their distribution can purchase them from designated coal ball merchants with their No. 40 comprehensive distribution certificate.</p>
<h3>Large Crowds Visit Ancient and Modern Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition</h3>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Power Supply Must Be Reasonable</h3>
<p>The power supply in this city is limited due to the reduced source of coal. Recently, the power company announced that the power supply time is from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM every night. However, this is not the case in reality. For example, the power supply time in the old First District and the eighth district is different. Sometimes the time is extended, sometimes the time is shortened, sometimes there is no electricity all day and night, and sometimes there is electricity all day and night (yesterday, from 7:00 AM to 2:00 AM when this was written, general users in the old First District were all supplied with electricity). This kind of divergent phenomenon is completely the result of the power supply side messing up its steps.</p>
<p>Since it has been decided that the power supply will be for three hours every night, why is it sometimes reduced and sometimes increased? This is incomprehensible. If the power supply is reduced due to a lack of coal, then there should be no possibility of supplying power all day and night at all. Even if there is temporary supply power, it should be accumulated for reserve. Today, if there is coal, it can be used more, and tomorrow, if there is no coal, it can be stopped. This kind of profligate behavior should absolutely not exist in public utilities. From the perspective of the credibility of the power company's announcement, there should not be a phenomenon of sudden increase or decrease, which reduces the faith of citizens.</p>
<p>Finally, we still advocate that during the lunar period of each month, street lights should be temporarily reduced or turned off, which can also save electricity. On the other hand, essential production and social welfare undertakings such as factories and hospitals cannot be supplied in the same way as general users. In short, it is hoped that general users will save electricity, and the power company should first achieve planned savings. Power supply must achieve the most reasonable allocation.</p>
