<h3>日首相視察飛機工塲對員工激勵有加　航空隊續攻冲繩美艦船團</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日鈴木首相二十二日赴飛機增產工場之第一綫視察，加以激勵，是日首相偕追水書記官長，遠藤航空兵器總局長官等，先赴某飛機製作塲，該工塲曾以生產成績優秀，　遠藤長官贈與豬二頭，詳細視察工員之奮鬥情形，下午二時三十分又赴該工場之地下工塲視察，此工塲以規模宏大及防空設施完善著稱，亦對全體員工激勵有加，迄三時半始返。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地二十二日中央社電　對冲繩周圍海域之敵艦船部隊嚴密監視中之日××司偵部隊，陸軍中尉高橋震二，陸軍曹長伊藤忍兩勇士，十九日晨惡劣天氣，踴躍出動，隱於密雲中，飛抵目的地上空，決然一舉突破雲層，創司偵之先例，超低空飛下强行搜索，沉着大胆於敵艦船上空偵察，有助今後作戰至大，二十日由某部隊長授予光輝之嘉賞詞，褒場武動。</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　關島之尼米資司令部，二十一日發表如次：日航空部隊復由十七日開始，攻擊冲繩方面之美艦船團。</p>
<h3>東亞各地戰况</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　東亞各地一週戰況如次：</p>
<p>西南太平洋方面：巴爾密拉，塔那底烏，六月二十五日敵軍登陸以來，日軍加以澈底攻擊，予以重創，壓制北部地區，至十八日掃蕩殘敵完成，峇厘巴板方面繼續上週展開激戰中，迄週末敵攻擊已呈消極，各戰綫雙方均對峙中。</p>
<p>玻根維爾·新幾內亞方面：日軍部隊繼續勇戰，尤以玻根維爾島日軍，克服一切惡條件，反繫執拗來攻之敵軍，收得相富戰果。上月下句日軍　侵入玻根維爾島南部妙諾河右岸地區之敵軍，截止十日，殺傷敵兵九百十五名，破壞戰車九輛，車輛三輛，幕舍二十七處。</p>
<p>玻根維爾島中央方面：戰綫無大變化，北部地區日軍，以一部兵力繼續山米猶陣地前進，以該河出擊途中，擊退四五百名敵軍，十日突入塔富，敵遺屍達百六十八名。又新幾內亞方面，九拉烏埃瓦克方面，日軍粉碎澳洲第六師團之攻勢，自上月上旬迄三十日，確認予敵兵員損害約達千五百名，其他負傷者千六百名。</p>
<p>緬甸方面：喜丹河口方面日軍部隊，渡過該河，於西岸採取攻勢，更於九日拂曉奪回梅卡西，米却庫及烏馬之敵陣，此後將其確保，日方收獲戰果，計殺傷敵兵員一千餘名，擊第飛機二架。鹵獲大砲五門，重輕機關槍十支，卡車八輛及其他武器彈藥。又卡洛方面敵軍逐次繼續南下，緬甸戰事熾烈情況與日俱增。</p>
<h3>準備決戰美方陣容</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　敵美爲擴大其戰略效果起見，出動其新編機動部隊，游弋於日本近海，實施轟炸·砲擊·窺其意擬於有機可乘時，出動其空母艦隊，以消耗日空軍及乘日軍之間隙，期可一舉結東戰爭，此爲敵軍之顯明作戰企圖。又準備此長終決戰之敵第一綫陣容，最近陸海空軍三方面，均有顯著人事更迭，對於歐洲及大東亞戰爭之有經驗將校，各配置於前方陣地，期於有事之際，可以用於對付日本土作戰方面。例如沖繩敵第十軍司令官巴克拿戰死後，麥克沃塞即調第十軍司令官史蒂威爾大將繼任該職，史蒂威爾曾於大陸與日軍接觸甚久，故爲最知悉日軍之一人，敵企圖之中國登陸作戰，或攻擊日本士時，此人厥爲良好之登陸軍指揮者。其次，敵爲準備登陸起見，更作大規模之戰略轟炸攻擊，統轄多數航空部隊，爲期圓滑作戰起見，乃新設馬里亞納第二十航空隊，改隸於太平洋戰略航空隊，與由歐洲調來之中將特里多爾第八航空隊，同屬於司令官大將史巴茲之指揮下。史巴茲爲擔任轟炸德國之要角，特里多爾　亦　其指揮，今與馬里亞　之羅美，共同向日本施行空中攻擊。又敵爲增加最大難關之接濟綫之效率起見，新設美國西部及中部太平洋補給司令部，以斯丹耶里却特遜兩中將爲司令官，此爲最注目之人事構成，誠然尼米資與麥克澳塞之連合與前同樣，與此對應之敵之蒙特巴頓與霍烈塞之配置，亦依然不動。觀於如次之敵對日包圍之首腦人員，即可明勝敵執抝大腦之作戰企圖，西南太平洋聯合軍總司令官麥克沃塞元帥，第六軍（菲島）庫爾加中將，第八軍（菲島）巴牙中將，象十軍（冲繼）史蒂威爾大將，東南亞洲聯合軍總司令官蒙特巴頓大將，陸上軍司令官奧里部阿里斯中將。空軍司令官奧斯派華中將，太平洋戰略航空隊司令官斯巴茲大將，第八航空隊（冲繩）特里多爾中將，第二十航空隊（馬里亞納）羅馬少將，遠東航空部隊戰術航空隊麥里那大將，第五航空隊（沖繩）海特中將，第七航空隊（冲繩）唐克拉斯少將，第十三航空隊（新幾內亞）彭茲準將。太平洋艦隊斯撲爾査斯大將，第五艦隊金開特大將，第九艦隊富萊西亞中將，航空母艦機動部隊塔過茲中將，快速空母機動部隊西亞猛少將，永陸兩用部隊蓋卡中將，潛永艦隊洛庫特少將。阿拉斯加方面陸軍司令官愛莫茲中將，第一航空隊蒲爾庫少將，馬里亞納方而陸軍司令官馬萊中將，中國方面陸軍司令官島迭麥亞中將，空軍司令官斯特梅亞中將，英國艦隊太平洋艦隊司令長官霍烈寒大將，東印度洋艦隊司令長官巴特大將。</p>
<h3>義首相否認太平洋參戰</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　據羅馬訊：義大利首相巴利，曾於日前否認義政府已有遠征軍一隊準備參加大平洋作戰之消息。</p>
<h3>消除英美侵蝕勢力開拓東亞光明前途　松本大尉在文化演講會講詞</h3>
<p>從冲繩島一役中，窺見敵美採取戰略行動，及與日本之特攻戰術，深爲世界密切注意。如今敵所採取之航空戰，則從馬里亞納基地起飛之B29型，向日本土各部市作盲目轟炸，並企圖破壞日木木土之工業地區，及海上陸上之交通綫，以機動部隊航空機作戰術上之轟炸。在另一方面，美國之陸海軍機構人事之更調，尤以在第一綫之海軍移調，實爲敵美正準備下期作戰。至在歐洲之敵兵力移動，敵雖誇　已陸續在移動中，惟須經印度，或敵本國方可至東亞，故敵今後之展開大決戰，於移動完畢後，始能實行。目前敵稱自作戰至今，僅始完成第一階段。查該階段之目標，乃企圖控制日本本土之制空權，以　測日本之空軍力量。而其第二階段，企岡破壤日本本土及大陸之交通，與日本國內之陸上交通綫。敵之第三階段，則企圖攫取日戰略上之要戰，向本上登陸分散與隔離日本之軍力。</p>
<h3>日美決戰須待明春</h3>
<p>惟觀敵方之企圖，目前猶未完成第一階段，關於日美兩熾之決戰，開始時間須在本年之十月間，在第一時期之大規模決戰須待明春四五月間方能度開，而敵決戰之目的地，現今尙不能斷言。蓋因敵在目前尙未決定戰略目標，如敵第七艦隊司令官金迪特所稱爲今腦力不佳，美軍應向東京直衝云云。而太平洋艦隊司令官尼米茲亦稱：美向日本本日登陸有利云云。同時倫敦泰晤士報亦主張美軍之向日本本土登陸，較大陸作戰有利，以大陸並非爲主要之決戰，猶爲輔助戰而已。</p>
<p>查日本自從　　　　　　　，　　有萬全之準備已完成　經　　，且把握冲繩一役之所得戰訓，力　　以擴大，而日本之特攻戰術，尤能發揮效果，使敵束手無策。過去在冲繩島上之作戰，敵美軍事評諭家亦稱：美軍在此作戰中，其海軍損失海陸軍爲甚，實爲日本之特攻戰法所致。同時尼米茲及敵軍政當局咸稱無法應付。此外日本又可利用山岳地帶，建築强固陣地，在日本本土多山，利用山岳構成鞏固陣地，加之發揮特攻情神，對來製之敵決予相當之邀擊，而敵亦曾稱：日本航空機之集中，至少有九千架至一萬架。最近以機動部隊航空戰略之轟炸，亦無法減少某力量，且日本又利用地下工廠以及疏散之工廠生產，每月增產在一千五百架以上，在貯生產兩方均豐富異常，口稱在決戰時，日本當以全力應戰。</p>
<h3>蘇聯顧慮東亞命運</h3>
<p>其次國際之　　最近渝行　院長　子文赴蘇訪問史太林，會談多次，後因英美蘇三頭會議之召開，卒吿中轟，此次特魯曼·邱吉爾·史太林之會談雖對於處理德國，及歐洲國境等問題，有所商討，而對大東亞之命運問題，當亦有議論。對大東亞之命運問題，當亦有議論。査此次三頭會議以和平爲前提，期爲兩年召開之和平會議作事前之準備保　，但目前蘇聯所採取之能態度如何？査過去舊金山會議，因英美本質與性格所造成形式上之結果，但在此次會議中，亦因性格上之關係，有所影響，况蘇聯民族性頗强，且爲東亞之民族性格，故吾人不管該會議之如何，無庸悲觀。深信蘇聯對東亞之命運，當亦鄭重顧慮，目前日美兩軍之作戰　成渡洩淘湧澎湃狀態，日趨激烈。</p>
<h3>打開危局應循之路</h3>
<p>吾人在此戰局推移與世界情勢展閒之時，應作如何想？應向如何目標前進？吾等應走之路在何處？關於此聲，本人並不欲單純地選擇一條路以爲最善之道，面强迫諸君去走，現在提出一件事實，或許可以當作一個思考的方法而來反省。</p>
<p>當十九世紀初　，拿破崙之鐵蹄蹂躪到到柏林，那時德國哲學家斐德氏，還在砲聲隆隆的大學請堂內講述其「吿德國國民」，力言艮族敎育的必要性，斐德氏的德國理想主義哲學，吾人可以斷言這是奠定第一次大戰前德國百年興隆之基礎。</p>
<p>現在日本已逢未曾有之國難，有志之士正深慮如何打開危局，菲島方而最高指揮官山下將軍曾在呂　島倡議「提高日本人的敎育程度」，德富翁亦吐露烈烈的意見，希望靑年奮起。最近石原將　力言天皇親政與改革國內，日本雖處此危機中，正在燃起眞　的革新火矩，而一死以殉國的特攻精神，更使革新的前途燦爛光明。</p>
<p>再顧中國現狀如何，經過抗戰八年，三政糧　是而立，造成混沌狀態，暗中攪案，不知有何所求，似乎欲求開拓走向近代國家之途。諸君爲負起將來中國的重任者，你們胸中也希望着近代的新統一中國，然而中日兩國現狀，可從世界史的關聯中反映出來，中日兩國在資本主義的發展上是後進的，走向近代化的路上也是落後的，因此在過去五十年乃至一百年間，在中國日本以及中日關係迭次受到悲慘的厄運，這固然是事實，走向近代化的路上比人家落後了。以及後進的資本主義的事實，這於中日兩國，是否爲宿命的悲劇，我叮以回答說：</p>
<p>此次世界大戰動　中，對於吾人正開拓着一條充滿希望的路，我現在作下面的想法，不知諸君認爲如何？</p>
<h3>堅持希望不稍放鬆</h3>
<p>十九世紀，自某種意義上，可認爲這是自由主義，民族主義，國家主義的時代，那時已孕育着走向帝國主義，造第成一次世大界戰的火種。由於第一次世界大戰，各人腦中就有深刻戰爭破壞與慘狀的印象，於是人類才愛好和平，國際主義，世界主義開始抬頭，但世界的實體決不是單一的，有許多地械情形過於複雜，然此種離開現實之觀念的世界主義，當然無法避免第二次大戰。依據本人觀察，此次大戰負有歷史的課題，此即在經濟上，政治上，社會上，用辯證法來結東國家主義與世界主義，以實現廣域主義與共榮圈思想。</p>
<p>大戰六年間，戰局千變萬化，共榮圈之形式幾經變貌，然廣域主義之抬頭相信是歷史的必然趨勢，是站於此立場，即想到根據中日兩國共同意識的東亞廣域圈，排除白種人支配東亞，拭除歐美侵蝕東亞，開拓中日提據之道，吾人始得望見東亞之黎明。</p>
<p>今日戰局苛烈已極，世界情勢萬　，東亞之現實不能不謂爲最深刻的悲慘，但吾人在此苛酷的現實重壓下，必須遠　到越過戰局，渡過政變的遠處。相反地說，現實愈慘，更應向遙遠的彼方懷着希望，吾人現在正感到「日已暮，路尙遠」。被現實壓迫幾將窒息，然希望應始終堅持不稍放鬆，相信孜孜屹屹者，必有光明照曜其身上。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>渝參政會與國民大會問題</h3>
<p>重慶的國民參政會第四屆第一次大會，自七月七日開幕，至七月二十日閉會。在這期間，一共舉行會議十九次。其中十次，都是政府各部會長官的施政報吿，僅有九次舉行正式審議。</p>
<p>在報吿部門，從參政員的嚴厲質問中，可以反映民間對車慶近來施政的不滿。其間尤以財政經濟及外交方面，最受指摘，而對於兵役內政社會農林各部報吿，更有許多問題，使當局無法解答。其問較可注目的，是陳誠的軍事及所謂準備總反攻的報告，由此可見重慶尙圖利用總反攻等名詞，以挽回人心。</p>
<p>在審議部門，通過了「請速批准聯合國憲　　」，「請進行　判締結中英蘇法軍事同盟條約案」等，前者無非爲一種適應國際新局勢的應時文草，後者則不免過於空洞。此外如關於改善兵役，改善將士待遇，戰後全國復興建設，發展工業生產等等，無非重拔了過去參政會早曾通過的議決案而已。</p>
<p>這次重慶參政會，從比較上可說是自有參政會以來最黯淡的一次。首先有共產黨籍參政員之拒絕出席，雖經政府諷勸中立派的黃炎培氏等前往進行遊說，結果依然無效；不僅無效，反使黃炎培氏等中立派，乘機和中共首腦獲得直接晤談的機會，在中共和第三勢力即民主同盟之間，成立了某種程度的默契，所以當黃氏等回渝時，即有第三勢力各參政員亦拒絕出席的表示。雖然最後黃氏在「爲顧全國民大會有必耍及各黨各派必須參加計」「不得已始自行　牲其意見」而勉强參加了一次會議，但仍聲明對於「參政會審卉委員會關於國民大會之報吿大有異議」，以示其保留的立塲。這是騰屆參政會上所罕見的。至少在重慶利用參政會以向中外標榜其民主一點，是失敗了。</p>
<p>形成這次參政會失敗的，就在國民大會問題，而參政員間對於這一問題所以意見大不一致者，表面上是對於開會日期，定於本年十一月十二日，未免過於侷促，結果不免草率通過憲法，對於國家國民及民主前途，都屬不忠。其次爲國民大會的代表，政府在原則上保持事變以前由國民黨所指派人員，現在時閱八九載，情勢與人事有了極大變遷，殊有失於眞正民衆代表的意義。現在參政會對於這一問題已按審查報吿通過，即日期委由政府按實際情勢愼重規定，而國民大會代表人選舉另定折衷辦法，因此，十一月十二日勢得不及舉行了。</p>
<p>和重慶方面的召集國民大會一舉對抗，中共也有在延安定期召集所謂一中國解放區人民代表大會」的準備，共規模和辦法，似乎和重慶唱對台戲，不過這種會議的俱正目標，未見有具體的宣布，除了和重慶對峙表現抗戰陣營的內訌之外，還有什麼現實的意義呢？可是，我們必須指出，我們國家的元氣虛損，實在經不起挾有權勢者，再三的兒戲玩弄和流血的內戰了！</p>
<h3>P51型襲關東　擊落毀八架　北海道邀擊戰果擴大</h3>
<p>大阪二十二日中央社電　南方基地之敵機P51型約有七十架，二十二日正午前後，有炸及掃射近畿地區之交通機關，航空基地及一部工場，約歷一小時。此外並有P51機約三十架，來襲岡山，香川德峯各島，迄二十二日下午三時，日方所判明之戰果，共計擊落及搫破各四架，阪神附近巿街之一部小火災，未幾即被撲滅，損害極爲輕微。</p>
<p>札幌二十二日中央社電　十四·十五兩日來製北海道之敵機動部隊，日方之邀擊戰果，據其後調查，判明計繫落敵機四十一架，擊破三十三架，此外海軍部隊亦有戰果收獲。</p>
<h3>三馬林達公路　日軍猛反擊</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地二十二日中央社電　峇厘巴板方面之敵，刻在三馬林達公路一帶，企圖迂迴密林地帶，迫近日軍第一機陣地，日軍亦乘機猛烈反擊，將之堅退，十六日復以數名肉搏隊攻擊該公路附近水源地敵工兵隊，斃敵十名，刻正肉搏猛鬥中，敵方亦出動迫擊砲及空軍等，亟欲恢復戰勢中。</p>
<h3>蘇北一帶　日掃蕩戰果</h3>

<p>瑞典京城二十二日中央社電　據路達社外交訪員著稱，刻下雖無官方證實之消息，然據倫敦消息靈通方面之觀察，現在波次坦舉行之三頭會談，或將於本週末暫吿一段落。俾使英首相邱吉爾及勞工業領袖阿特里，能於下週四暫時歸返英京，採悉總選舉之結果如何。然據另一方面臆測，縱使特科曼·邱吉爾·史太林三巨頭各歸返本國，亦不致將會談暫時擱淺，蓋目前尙有一切大問題須待彼等決斷。</p>

<h3>軍事問題</h3>

<p>近郊通訊</p>
<h3>開禁後之米糧運輸</h3>
<p>— 志澄</p>
<p>自國府當局，鑒於各地米價暴漲不已，人民生活深感莫大威脅，特施行緊急措置，暫行傳止收買，撤銷移動限制，目的在開放米源，以斯自由流通，實行後，米糧源源運滬，上海米價立即回低。近日以來，社會各界。多注意於開禁以後之各方面情形，以期充裕民食，實現安定民生之目的，故記者奉派前往上海近郊產米地區——松江，金山，申江，塞　，南匯等地考察，茲將觀感所及，擇要報道於後：</p>
<h3>開禁前後</h3>
<p>在中央未頒佈米糧緊急措置前，各地米糧之移動，受有限制，尤其松江與金山，規定爲軍米區域，鄉間米糧不能隨便移入域區或市　，以致各地米價與上海的差額，總在三分之一以上，且在松江城區的東門與西門，亦有上落。因此，常被一般單帮米販，零星斷續，私運來滬，更有許冬資金與勢力俱厚之商人，利用優勢，囤積居奇，操縱價格，近一月來，松江米價自三十五萬步漲至六十萬元，金山自三十八萬昇至五十餘萬元等等。</p>
<p>開禁以後，自由移動，各地米糧，販運流通，卜海米價回降，各鄉區移入城廂者，亦大爲通暢，以致各地米價相繼回落，如金山自五十餘萬回至四十萬，松江自六十萬回至五十萬左右，閔行自七十萬回至五十萬。但各產米區，値此靑黃不接之時以數量有限，由於輸出之自然趨勢，遂使產米區（松江），與滬市價格扯平。如在記者離松之日（七月十一日）白米每石五十四萬（小斛每石一百五十斤），若販運到上海，加上運費，重量之差（上海中斛每石一百五十六斤），沿途開銷，及販運者的伙食，到漕永涇時，成本已在六十萬左右，此爲滬郊各地之」般情形，惟其來自鐵路綫者，則略有不同。因此，各單帮米販均改由鐵路至產米區（蘇州，無錫，嘉善等地）採購。</p>
<h3>販運情形</h3>
<p>上海米糧之來源，大帮均爲常州，無錫，常熟，蘇州，崑山，嘉興，嘉善，靑浦，松江，金山，奉賢等縣。米糧由產米區輸入滬市之路綫，據記者所知約有下列各綫：松滬路，松泗路，滬閔南拓路，上南路，靑滬路，內河輸船及京滬，滬杭兩鐵道，茲將記老所經各綫分述於後。</p>
<p>在米糧統制時，松江企山各地之米糧，由於對鎖嚴厲，均轉輾由小路走私，運至周浦，因是周浦成爲一大米糧集散地，上南路及周浦至北蔡至龍王廟，原是偷運米糧的大道，在最五，開放通行後，松江金山一帶，司直接運抵上海，不必再行續道，故該鎭輸入之米，日見減少，從前每日有千餘石，現在不過百石左右，而上南路却成爲山芋麵粉及雜糧，運往市區的要道。據一私阪麵粉者稱，「一包麵粉，自川沙之張港柵運抵周浦，除去伙食開銷，可凈賺一萬元」。</p>
<p>自奉賢歸來，行經滬　南拓路，見許多男女米販，以公共汽車及自由車爲工具，從莊家行，南橋，葉謝，張澤，鄔家橋等地載米而返，渡江至閔行，經公路直達上海，僅有少數，銷售於閔行，每日約二十餘石，多至三十餘石，故一般米行大都均改營雜糧，每輛自由車，可運一石餘，掮販者僅一二斗，每日至多往來一次。滬閔道上，三兩米阪，往來不絕，構成滬市民食之一脈。</p>
<p>離開閔行，搭車經松滬路抵松江，途中見一卡車，載米十餘石而過，其上人米各佔其半，據云此類卡車，運費至鉅，每石價約三萬元，零賞押車人酒力每石四千元，至遇不法勒索時，由車主負責應付。</p>
<p>松江輸出之另一路徑，是由松江至泗涇七寳等地，用自由車，脚划船及汽車等轉輾來滬，裝運數量每日約有數百担，最近因爲鐵路運輸較暢，搬運數已漸趨平淡。</p>
<p>從金山平湖一帶所採辦米種的單帮客，均以內河輸船平湖班爲交通工具，每到一碼頭，靠岸時，上下的米販，，熙熙攘攘擁擠不堪，有如航海大郵船到港口一般，不管艙而底和蓬頂，都是一包包的米袋。</p>
<p>在運輸方面，交通工具亟待增加，運輸機關尤宜改善，如運費之增加，押車或船者之「另賞」，其實名爲「另賞」，無異强索，否則擯諾路畔，視若無睹，在「調劑民食，圓滑運輸」之今日，當局應積極取締。</p>
<h3>中途需索</h3>
<p>在米運開放伊始，政府　局，爲防止沿途軍警，留難勒案，以及各地方政府藉口維持境內民食，限制流通等情，己三申五令，嚴密查禁。實際上，市郊各要道之關卡，較過去已改善多矣，惟尙有少數軍警，仍小有需索，爲數每石在五百元左右，一般販戶以爲數甚微，並未向所屬機關舉發，但此風不可長，日久生疲，難免擴大趨勢，故應密查以取締之。</p>
<p>在金山返松江之旅途中，據一米販向記者說：「在離採涇鎭不遠的某一關卡，遇有米東過此關，關員開口討價每車五萬，經多次折衝下，結果每車以一萬餘元通過」。而且在松江東門外，離鐵路不遠之一檢問所，遇有載米卡軍經過，即以檢查爲由，點明擔數，向押車人徵收，如每事裝十石以上，須六七萬方得通過。</p>
<p>在周浦　各進出要田，派有專員徵收「保警補助費」，對出入及過境之米糧及商品等，均須徵收，商品徵千分之十，米糧入境免收，出境徵千分之五，如當地米價六十萬元，每石徵三千元另加手續費六百元，共三千六百元，但在國府當局飭令之下，無論出境或入境，均應豁免，以利流通</p>
<p>準備歸返之前夕，記者在街道　光，遇一米阪，談及販運情形，據其所述如次：「本人在七月八日從上海新龍華站買嘉善三等票，進車站時，警察索一千元，然後排隊，化三千元請黑帽子在衣服上用白粉寫號，票價三千元，共出了七千元方始上車，扺嘉善時，上鎭買米，以四十七萬元貿了一石，用黃包車運至軍站，沿途開銷三千元，進站時一石米，又得開銷四千元，否則將米袋甩去或打人，在行李處員磅時，米每件一萬三千元，黑市車票代價，每張在一萬四千元以上。在米袋未上車前，各色人等，隨時可以勒索，每次總須一萬至五千，方能打發動身，否則以短刀劃破米袋。米在行李車上，更須有人看守，不然到站時，袋上千空百隙，袋裏所春無幾。總之，一石米到了上海，除伙食外，各種開銷總計在十萬元以上。而所賺者僅二三萬而已，更有旅途之痛苦，在在均爲局外人不得其詳者」，言罷悲憤不已，　爲生活計。仍忍淚爲之。</p>
<h3>根絕囤積</h3>
<p>自米糧收買後，一部份農民僅是自給，更以戰時農耕生產效率減低，故各產米區存量不豐，欲在短時期內，收集大批，以待輸出，自屬不易，目前滬市民食，幾乎全係無數敷帮米販繼續供應。</p>
<p>物價步漲，一般農民願意貯米，在急需或農耕施肥時，始以存米，逐漸糶出。米價回跌之時，一般當戶及工商機關，鑒於以往之趨勢，在低價時，大量購貯。少數資金雄原之米商，在自由流通後，深入內地採辦囤積。更有若干米行，因地方供應過高，以停業爲藉口，一方連絡當地有力者，囤積操縱。總上所述，均使米糧偏集，失却調劑目的，此唯有待於當事人之深明大義，及旱覺悟，放棄「小我」行爲，應予以澈底供獻於全社會，則民食叮裕，安定民生之目的可達</p>

<h3>金融巿况　上週猛漲</h3>
<p>本市金融與工商各界市况，最近一週因受種種流言之刺激，繼績演變，其市價上漲之烈，較之前週更甚，且因投機市儈從中慫恿，煽惑人心，志忑不定，資產家不斷吸收現貨，造成　碼枯竭交易漸成無貨成交。</p>
<h3>金證券</h3>
<p>金證券週一即起漲風，到期及四期相較前週六收盤高升六七十萬元一兩，週二平後復挺升，週三雖傳有五期金證券發行消息，但仍未能壓制，買勢　見高漲，斯時空氣頗形緊張，週四週五　挺更烈，週六突出九百萬大關，旋即退入九十大關內，一週內漲起達百分之九十以上。紋銀公債及其他貨幣，亦賡隨上升。</p>
<h3>華股</h3>
<p>華股兩點况隨金巿騰漲尤甚，惟中途因空襲關係稍受挫折，美亞永安公司及紗廠之熱門股一帆風順，扶按直上，其他中小型股，均漲起六成以上。市面現鈔則以物價繼漲，不敷需要，缺乏恐慌，殊難根本解除。銀根不易收緊，乃因各金融機關開發本票，仍屬濫泛，中儲當局對此問題，已在嚴密注視。</p>
<h3>米糧日用品</h3>
<p>至於工商各業方面，工廠電力需要仍未能充分解決，復工準備，尙難如期實現。除米糧及雜糧漲風稍平外，其他日用品如油·糖·肥皂·火柴·洋燭·棉織品·呢絨·綢緞·紙價·五金等市似騰漲不已，尤其各業門售商品標價，漫無標準，一日更改提高數次，巿民購買貨物，　目受損者不勝枚舉，希望當局對評價施策，嚴厲執行。</p>

<h3>展開民衆保甲自衛運動</h3>
<p>— 袁殊</p>
<p>新中國報社長袁殊於昨（廿二）日下午七時以市區保甲宣傳委員會委員名義，假上海廣播電台主講：「展開民衆保甲自衛運動」。由上海報誌聯合會總幹事　晚移代表廣播，茲誌其原文如左：</p>
<h3>保甲運動的强化</h3>
<p>今天所談保甲問題已非空講理論，而是如何眞正實踐與强化保甲自衛運動的時候了。所謂「民　保甲自衛」，簡而言之，就是有組織的民衆自衛，在作戰時期，無論任何國家如果沒有完善的保甲組織，則　旦發生軍事行爲，其士地人民必遭　大的損害，故作戰階段，不但要有　强的前方，並且要有堅强的後方。所謂後方，這就是堅强的保甲組織。　言世界戰爭，中日事變，不過是東亞的內亂，大東亞戰爭勃發以後，中日事變本身的意義已經解消，而現在是白種人向東方的迫害，正是東亞民族特別是中國民族之自身的保衛與爭取獨立解放的時候了。處在柬亞大陸柬南的中國海岸地帶，隨時有被美軍登陸作戰或戰略轟炸的可能，美軍登陸作戰的結果，勢必促成慘烈的大戰，而使中國民衆遭受空前的浩刧，我人試問每一個中國人，有誰願意坐視社國土地人民之被蹂躪，我們是不　有着自衛的力量。</p>
<h3>推進四種重要工作</h3>
<p>敵美空軍對中國海岸各大城市的戰略轟炸，最近已經開始，對華南一帶克施行　氈式之盲目轟炸，近來美機對上海地區的空襲，中國民衆也受到很大的犧牲。爲了挽救當前的危機，展開民衆保甲自　運動，實爲每一個中國國民應做的工作。在推行民衆保甲運動時，吾人必須做到下面四件工作：</p>
<p>完成戰時生活體制。在戰局急　中的中國民衆，每一國民是否能實行戰時體制，實是一個疑問。以上海一地而言，我們竟很少看到民衆決戰的情緒，因此我們希望從保甲全體的活動上，使每一保甲單位完成其作戰生活，日本國民的保甲訓練生活方式便是一個很好的模範。</p>
<p>促進保甲靑年訓練。靑年訓練是民衆自衛的中心工作，動員國家知識靑年，其最好的步驟，就是從保甲靑年訓練做起，在決戰階段對於靑年武裝雖有人提出，但這種任務，如由政府與保甲兩方面共同做去，倒是開拓中國靑年前途的正當出路。</p>
<p>趕速完成防衛設施。戰時保甲對於防空·防火·防毒等種種設施非常重要，平原城市本無天然防空的特點，故防空設備更應儘量築造，爲減少空襲的損害，也唯有從保甲防空工作做起。</p>
<p>嚴密組識保甲機構。現在都市和農村的保甲機構在系統上雖已完成，但實際上還未能健全。吾人不能否認，有許多地域，仍有共產黨或反動份子活動着，所以民衆自衛的根本對策，還是要嚴密保甲組識做起，使每一保甲單位，都成爲戰爭的服役者，而對於保甲工作人員更當積極鍊成。</p>
<h3>加强大陸防衛的力量</h3>
<p>德之，中國海岸地帶，是美軍作戰上重要的戰略地，此地區物資最　饒，人口最稠密，可稱爲中國大陸的前衛堡壘，由於人口的衆多，再加以完善的保甲組織，才能加强防衛的力量。最近各種防衛工作的完成，可說是民衆保甲直接間接協助戰爭的明證。我國人重視鄉土，同時也重視宗族，這就是愛護國土與民族的基本精神，我們熱忱希望着全國同胞，在世界歷史的新世紀上，展開統一的民衆保甲自衛運動，舉其全力，協助盟軍英勇將士，努力作戰，來保衛祖國，保衛東亞。</p>

<h3>保甲處一年來重要工作實施概況（三十三年七月至三十四年六月）</h3>
<p>— 顧繼武</p>
<p>保甲處現轄十八區（計　浦·新成·老閘·普陀·江寗·靜安·泰山·常熟·　家灣·華山·長寗·徐家滙·邑廟·蓬萊·斜　·閘北·新市街及東昌區之一部），共計九十聯保，一〇四九　，一六〇六七甲，四七一〇八三戶。人口男一〇七七七〇二，女九一八五一三口，男孩二六四二三三口，女孩二二八五六四口，總計二四八九〇一二口　蘇州河以北之北四川路西虹口·虹口·提　橋·楡林路·楊樹浦等六區，及東昌區之一部，隸屬海軍警備地區保甲管理，縣郊區則山市政府保甲委員會管轄，其中　區都分因保甲編制與　局轄區不同，故發給居住證工作，尙未能完全舉辨，現市附正力謀統一補救中。</p>
<p>保甲處轄區內市民之籍貫·年齡·職業·出生·死亡·宗敎·國籍·工廠·商店等統計，將次第完成，此種統計，在中國尙屬創擧，辦理之初，略較困難。</p>
<p>保甲經費，由市府批准，取諸地方，用諸地方，　出爲入之原則。三十三年七月至十二月，根據附戶按月征收十元，正戶三十元，舖戶五十元，特戶（由各該區總聯保長主任委員曁正副分局長，依照不得超過一保征收總額之原則內，依實際估定數目後征收之。）計六個月征收總額爲五八，二九五，六三五元。三十四年一月至六月根據附戶按月五十元，正戶一百元，舖戶二百元，特戶（征收辨法與三十三年同），計六個月征收總額爲二八三，一六六，三一〇元。其中八成留於地方，各自根據現實需要，作爲辦公及建設之用，二成經資，解送市區保甲委員會，作全體性設施之用。其經費之動支，均須經該市區委員會各區分會之決議　並旱准後爲之。其保管及支付之辦法，由主任委員總聯保長及正副分局長，共同負責，經費存儲於規定銀行，提款時須有上述四人中三人以上之印鑑，提取　用之。保甲委員會二成經費之動用，先造具預算，呈請委員長核准後支配之。</p>
<p>征收保甲經費，根據市府核准之數額，按月向市民收取，並給予同數額特製之保甲綱　證，黏貼於證片上，並由保甲長蓋印，以爲憑證。並作爲戶口移動領取配給物之證件。此種制度，經嚴格推行，尙無中飽浮收等流弊發現。居民之移出移入，警察分局與保甲方面均能局時知悉，因本轄區內之戶籍爲警察與保甲合一之　　故也。</p>
<p>市區保甲委員會，以羅秘書長兼任委員畏，各區主任委員總聯保長爲當然委員，警察局關係處長爲當然常務委員，參加地方士紳名流組織而成。</p>
<p>市區保甲委員會各區分會，目前已全部成立，委員定額爲二十一員，聯保長，警察分局正副分局長爲當然委員，加入地方名流士紳組識之，就地方名流士紳中最有資望者，擔任爲主任委員。</p>
<p>茲將去年七月至本年六月最重要之工作，分述於下：</p>
<p>居住證之換發——過去舊一八兩區，南滬西區越界築路，舊南市區，舊閘北區等所頒發之市民證或居住證等，因管轄權之不同，式樣內容，均不一致，經邀照內政部之現定，于以統一換發，幷澈底講求去除秋弊之方，　訂換發辦法，在實施中雖間有不肖份子，不守法規，從中舞弊，均維分別予以嚴處，務使達成便民之目的。惟警察局之組織，爲分局長中心負責之制度，各該分局富時未免仍有狃於成習之弊，就大體上言，過去之恕習，大部份均經掃除。</p>
<p>自警團團本部之樹立——自自警制度樹立後，盜竊恐怖等罪行，頓形減少。惟各區各自爲政，因辦法之不統一，雖一路之隔，居民有苦樂不同之愈，自警效用，因之亦大爲減色。爲補救此項缺點，加强發揮效用，統一步驟起見，樹立團本部，以周兼局良兼任團長，副局長兼任副團長，保甲處長爲秘書長，關係處長亦分別義仟工作，强力運用團本部指導下之各區，統一成立自　大隊，以總聯保長兼任大隊長，分局畏擔任督導員，達成警保緊密合作之目的，就各區之智識靑年，加以嚴格之訓練，組成模範隊，使爲自警幹部人員。</p>
<p>協助防空警備工作——目前時局日趨緊敎，防空警備丁作爲有要之急務。防空警備資材之設備，亟須充實，似此非政府單方面所能舉辦，本市市民防空本部，特開設防空訓練所，轄區內各保甲區按期選派學員，人所受訓，至本年六月底止已畢業五期，約計七百人，現均在各區擔任指導防空任務，目前警備防空資材設備經費之募集，根據市政府之核准及指示，積極協助警防空當局進行工作，計募捐總額二萬萬另一百餘萬元，按照核准之預算，分別由各區支配購置警備防空之陣容，得有顯著之充實。</p>
<p>成立宣傳委員員會——爲使市民暸解國民判於國家有應盡之義務，保甲工作之意義，組織訓練之易於推展，經聘請各通訊社各報社市宣傳處重要人員，担任保甲宣傳委員，幷分區負担工作。以申報社長陳彬龢爲主任委員，負責　劃，爲促成市民更進一層之認識，官民雙方意見，有融治之交流。幷發行自警週報，以傳達各保甲區之動態與政府之法令及指示。</p>
<p>舉行自警團春李大檢閱——爲發揚自警自衛之精神，提高其服務之興趣，擴大其對國家社會之觀念，檢查渦去之成續，於川四年四月十五日在跑馬應舉行春李大檢閱，參加各區團員計六千五百餘名，各方對此次檢閱，批評至爲良好。</p>
<p>分區擧行保甲書記以上訓練班——鑒於過去保甲書記以上各級保甲專任職員，事實上負責極多，而對於法章則未能有深切之明陳，且間有行爲不妥之事件發現，因加以嚴格之甄別，予以統一之訓練。計已舉辦此項訓練者爲篷萊·斜橋·邑廟·華山·長寗等五區，訓練後回歸各區工作，有極顯著之進步，此後各區均將分別實施訓練。</p>
<p>籌備舉辦保甲自警幹部人員集中訓練國——爲堅强自警組織，統一訓練，規定各區自警大隊分隊長以上之人員，均須集巾受訓，已準備完畢，七月一日開學。</p>
<p>統一保甲人員臂章及身份證——過去各區保甲人員臂章及身份證，五光十色，流弊殊多。本處茲已印製統一臂章及身份證，分發佩用。</p>
<p>接辦發外國人旅行證事宜——本市外國人之居住證之發給，及歸化事宜，本由本處辦理，而外國人旅行證，則由外交部駐滬特派員公署辨理；本年五月，奉令改由警察局接辦，已接收完畢，繼總辦理。</p>
<p>關於自警團減免服役事項——市民對自警團服役，內政部及其他方面，均主嚴格辦理，經訂立條例，吳准市府公佈嚴格執行，俾養成市民對國家盡義務對政府謀協力爲光榮而當然之觀念，第此事之成功，仍有待於各級政府機關及各級機構之協力耳。</p>
<p>查保甲工作，實屬千頭萬緒，經二年來積極推進，雖社會信用，日有增加，但距理想之境地，尙屬遙遠，然七年之病，須求三年之艾，木人惟有秉承長官之指導，一本至誠純潔之心意，勉竭智能，勇往邁進而已。</p>
<h3>巿府更改辦公時間之我見</h3>
<p>— 寒鴉</p>
<p>在夏季更改辦公時間，其原因是爲了避免暑熱的時間，使辦事人員的精神安逸，不致減少工作效能，而夏季最暑熱的時間當然在下午，每人的精神都覺疲乏懶怠，假使要工作，工作的效果也必減少許多，因此，金融界每於暑期改爲半日辦工，而市政府從本月十六日起，辦公時間上午照舊　下午且改爲從三時半至六時，這不單對工作的效率減少，而凡對辦事人員在精神上時間上都受很大的損失。</p>
<p>現今大部職員或在市府食堂進膳，或自己携帶膳食等，這因爲是離家太遠時間侷促和中午往返過於　熱的緣故，假使時間更改後，中間空餘三小時半，回家用膳呢，却無公共車輛，在這烈日當空的時候，往返步行二次，到辨公室精神已疲乏不堪，工作的效能當然要無形減弱，假使仍是在市府內進膳，那麼午後這三小時餘的時間究全是空餘的了，或是聊天胡鬧，或是瞌睡休息，把這悠長的半天浪費了，等幾小時的瞌睡或聊天之後，再重聚精會神地來恢復工作，那是一件很困雖的事。但是，不聊天和瞌睡，在這三小時的時間中，又可怎樣去利用呢？有什麼有益身心的消遣呢？除了浪費時間之外，什麼都沒有辦法，假使全市府以一萬人計，每人爲三小時，那麼，每天就得白白地浪費三萬小時，因在國難當頭的時期似乎不甚附合節約的原則。</p>
<p>假如　員都回家進膳，那麼從早晨六時起身，梳洗完畢，步行或乘車至辦公室，時問也不會如何多餘的了，中午除了步行進膳之外，最多也不過一小時半的休息罷了，下午辦公至六時，到家後至早也耍六時半過了，就得立刻忙着洗浴等事，到臨睡，也不會有什麼空餘的時間，每個辦事人員從早到晚，除了機械一樣地工作之外，連閱讀書報和身心修養的機會都沒有了。職員們在精神上也將感到比往前痛苦多了。</p>
<p>其次，在電流限制和節約聲中，本來一切洗浴晚飯等事部可在黃昏之前完畢，以後就在黑暗中摸索也無妨，將近傍晚七時方能到家的公務人員，再忙着洗浴等事，勢必要在燈光之下方能完畢。就在光綫不明的辦公室中，或走廊裏，辦公時間的前後至少要延長半小時燈火，公私兩方在物質上都受到</p>
<p>關於工作方面，譬如對商號的調查工作或納稅工作，目前各商號大部都在五時以前就預備停止營業，那麼，幾乎在四時半以後就無從工作了。</p>
<p>所以我建議將下午三時半至六時的二個半鐘點，盡可能加在上午，如早　提早一小時和中午延長一小時半辦公，從上午八時起至下午一時半止，同樣辦公五小時半，不但工作能一貫，而且人力物力都能減省許多，辦事人員的精神也可以安逸多了，希望當局能硏究採納，參考改正。</p>
<h3>滬閔公路亟需修築</h3>
<p>— 迪明</p>
<p>滬閔公路爲滬杭國道由上海閔行之一段，此路於閔行渡浦江與國道南段啣接，經南橋金山衛乍浦而達杭州，於北橋則有支綫達松江，而與滬杭甬鐵路聯絡。故此一段公路，實爲上海向南方的陸上重要交通幹綫之一。</p>
<p>此路建築於民國十一年，戰事之前，由浙江省公路局管理，因管理得當，故路面平坦寬曠，路基堅實穩固，爲國內優良公路之一。軍興之後，公路局西撤，此路即入無政府狀態，但有破壞，未見修理者已八年於茲，此路之破敗情形，吾人實可想而知矣。</p>
<p>筆者此次因事由滬去閔，乘華中鐵道長途汽車出發。初路面尙佳，出漕河涇後，路面即已破壞不堪，不但高低起伏，且有無數洞穴，直徑約一公尺，深度幾達滬上小型房空壉之半，聯貫並陳於路巾，以致車行其上，顚撲不定，此種情形，尤以吳家巷至北橋一長段最甚。更有數處深潭，尙積有前數日陣雨所降之水，車行其中，覓路爲難。以是車行速率遲緩，時有拋錨等事發生。本來一小時可畢之行程，現需三四小時，方可到達。不但此也，據筆者觀之，如此路而，若逢舊或載重之車輛，則覆車之虞，恐或難免，此乃大値考慮及憂慮之事也。</p>
<p>目前疏散人口，漸趨積極，然而談疏散必先暢交通。滬閔公路南由閔行而通浦南之奉　金山松江各縣，自此數縣可轉平湖海鹽乍浦等地，西由北橋傳松江而可達楓涇嘉善嘉興等地，故爲疏散交通綫中極重要之一環。再由物資遝輸方面言，則上述數地之日用品工業品等，大部均賴上海方面經由此公路輸人，面各地本糧土產等等，又經此公路而輸至上海，故此路亦爲上海與其鄰近各縣之經濟動脈。故不論從疏散人口方面，或從物資運輸方面言，此路實不容其長此處於目前之每况愈下式的破敗狀况之中，而宜即行修築，一以利人口之疏散，二以利物資之運輸。</p>
<p>頃聞貫通江蘇省與上海巿之蘇滬公路，經團地當局　商之結果，業已打破種種困難，動工修理，而本路則全處於本市轄境中，想困難當較蘇滬公路爲少，工程方面，亦當較爲便利。希本市路政及疏散各當局注意及之。</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Inspects Aircraft Factory, Greatly Encouraging Employees; Air Force Continues to Attack Okinawan American Ship Convoy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki inspected the front lines of aircraft production factories on the 22nd to provide encouragement. On the same day, the Prime Minister, accompanied by Secretary-General Tsuimizu, Director-General of the Aviation Weapons Bureau Endo, and others, first visited a certain aircraft manufacturing plant. The factory had previously been awarded two pigs by Director-General Endo for its outstanding production performance. The Prime Minister inspected the workers' efforts in detail. At 2:30 PM, he also visited the underground factory of the same plant, which is known for its grand scale and perfect air defense facilities. He also greatly encouraged all employees, finally returning at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese ×× Division reconnaissance unit, which is closely monitoring the enemy's warship forces in the waters around Okinawa, dispatched two brave soldiers, Army Lieutenant Takahashi Shinji and Army Sergeant Major Ito Shinobu, on the morning of the 19th in adverse weather conditions. They courageously took off, concealed themselves in dense clouds, and flew to the airspace above their target. They resolutely broke through the clouds in one fell swoop, setting a precedent for division reconnaissance. They flew down at ultra-low altitude and forcefully searched, calmly and boldly reconnoitering over the enemy warships, greatly assisting future operations. On the 20th, the commander of a certain unit awarded them glorious commendations, praising their martial valor.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Nimitz Headquarters on Guam announced on the 21st as follows: Japanese air forces have resumed attacking the American warship convoys off Okinawa since the 17th.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The war situation in various parts of East Asia over the past week is as follows:</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Area: At Palmyra and Tanahmerah, since the enemy troops landed on June 25th, the Japanese army has thoroughly attacked them, inflicting heavy damage and suppressing the northern area. The mopping up of the remaining enemy forces was completed by the 18th. In the Balikpapan area, fierce battles continued from last week. By the end of the week, enemy attacks had become passive, and both sides were in a standoff on all fronts.</p>
<p>Bougainville and New Guinea Area: Japanese army units continued to fight bravely, especially the Japanese army on Bougainville Island, which overcame all adverse conditions and countered the stubborn attacks of the enemy, achieving considerable battle results. Last month, the Japanese army invaded the enemy's territory on the right bank of the Mono River in the southern part of Bougainville Island. By the 10th, they had killed or wounded 915 enemy soldiers, destroyed 9 tanks, 3 vehicles, and 27 barracks.</p>
<p>Central Bougainville Island Area: There were no major changes on the front lines. In the northern area, the Japanese army continued to advance on the Sammy-U Hill with a part of its forces. While attacking along the river, they repelled 400-500 enemy soldiers. On the 10th, they broke into Tafu, where the enemy left 168 corpses. In addition, in the New Guinea area, in the Kurau-Ewa area, the Japanese army crushed the offensive of the Australian 6th Division. From the beginning of last month to the 30th, it was confirmed that the enemy suffered approximately 1,500 personnel casualties and another 1,600 wounded.</p>
<p>Burma Area: Japanese army units in the Xitan River estuary area crossed the river and launched an offensive on the west bank. On the dawn of the 9th, they recaptured the enemy positions at Mekase, Micheku, and Uma, and have since secured them. The Japanese side achieved battle results, killing or wounding more than 1,000 enemy soldiers and shooting down two enemy aircraft, capturing five artillery pieces, ten heavy and light machine guns, eight trucks, and other weapons and ammunition. In the Kalaw area, enemy forces gradually continued to advance southward, and the intensity of the Burmese war increased daily.</p>
<h3>American Lineup in Preparation for the Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to expand its strategic effects, the enemy United States has deployed its newly formed mobile units, cruising in the Japanese near sea, implementing bombing and shelling, seeking to take advantage of opportunities. It intends to deploy its aircraft carrier fleet to deplete the Japanese air force and take advantage of gaps in the Japanese army in the hope of ending the war in one fell swoop. This is the enemy's clear operational intention. In preparation for this final decisive battle, the enemy's frontline lineup has recently undergone significant personnel changes in the land, sea, and air forces. Experienced officers from the European and Greater East Asia Wars have been deployed to the front lines, hoping to use them to deal with the Japanese mainland operation in case of emergency. For example, after the death of General Buckner, commander of the enemy's Tenth Army on Okinawa, Stilwell was transferred to succeed him as commander of the Tenth Army. Stilwell had been in contact with the Japanese army on the mainland for a long time, so he was one of the most knowledgeable people about the Japanese army. If the enemy attempts a landing operation in China or an attack on Japan, this person would be a good commander for the landing force. Second, in preparation for the landing, the enemy is conducting a large-scale strategic bombing attack. In order to streamline operations with a large number of air forces, a new Twentieth Air Force in the Mariana Islands was established and transferred to the Pacific Strategic Air Force, which, together with the Eighth Air Force, which was transferred from Europe under Lieutenant General Trider, is under the command of Commander General Spaatz. Spaatz was responsible for bombing Germany, and Trider also commanded it. Now, together with Ramey in the Mariana Islands, they are jointly conducting air attacks on Japan. In addition, in order to increase the efficiency of the supply line, which is the most difficult hurdle, a new US Western and Central Pacific Supply Command was established with Lieutenant Generals Stanley Ritcheson as commanders. This is the most noteworthy personnel composition. Indeed, the alliance between Nimitz and MacArthur remains the same, and the corresponding deployment of Mountbatten and Hullett remains unchanged. Observing the enemy's encircling headquarters personnel against Japan, it is clear that the enemy's operational intentions are to persevere against the tenacious brains. Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Allied Forces, Marshal MacArthur; Commander of the Sixth Army (Philippines), Lieutenant General Kruger; Commander of the Eighth Army (Philippines), Lieutenant General Baega; Commander of the Tenth Army (Okinawa), General Stilwell; Supreme Commander of the Southeast Asia Allied Forces, Marshal Mountbatten; Commander of the Ground Forces, Lieutenant General Olive Allis; Air Force Commander, Lieutenant General Ospaihua; Commander of the Pacific Strategic Air Force, General Spaatz; Commander of the Eighth Air Force (Okinawa), Lieutenant General Trider; Commander of the Twentieth Air Force (Mariana Islands), Major General Ramey; Commander of the Far East Air Force Tactical Air Force, General Melli Na; Commander of the Fifth Air Force (Okinawa), Lieutenant General Hait; Commander of the Seventh Air Force (Okinawa), Major General Douglas; Commander of the Thirteenth Air Force (New Guinea), Brigadier General Penz. Commander of the Pacific Fleet, General Spruance; Commander of the Fifth Fleet, General Kingcate; Commander of the Ninth Fleet, Vice Admiral Fleischer; Commander of the Aircraft Carrier Mobile Force, Vice Admiral Takudz; Commander of the Fast Aircraft Carrier Mobile Force, Rear Admiral Shiameng; Commander of the Amphibious Force, Vice Admiral Gai Ka; Commander of the Submarine Fleet, Rear Admiral Lockut. Army Commander of the Alaskan Region, Lieutenant General Amos; Commander of the First Air Force, Major General Purk; Army Commander of the Mariana Island Area, Lieutenant General Malay; Army Commander of the China Region, Lieutenant General Island Die Meier; Air Force Commander, Lieutenant General Streamier; Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet Pacific Fleet, General Hullett; Commander-in-Chief of the East Indian Ocean Fleet, General Butt.</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Denies Participation in the Pacific War</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Rome report, Italian Prime Minister Barri recently denied reports that an Italian government expeditionary force was preparing to participate in the Pacific War.</p>
<h3>Eliminating British and American Encroaching Forces and Opening up a Bright Future for East Asia: Speech by Captain Matsumoto at a Cultural Lecture</h3>
<p>The strategic actions taken by the enemy United States in the Battle of Okinawa, and Japan's special attack tactics, have drawn close attention from the world. The enemy's current air war involves the blind bombing of cities in various parts of the Japanese mainland by B-29s taking off from the Mariana Islands base, and attempts to destroy the industrial areas and sea and land transportation lines of Japan, as well as tactical bombing by mobile unit aircraft. On the other hand, the reorganization of the personnel of the US Army and Navy, especially the transfer of naval forces on the front lines, shows that the enemy United States is preparing for the next phase of operations. As for the movement of enemy forces in Europe, although the enemy boasts that they are being moved successively, they must pass through India or the enemy's home country to reach East Asia. Therefore, the enemy's future large-scale decisive battle will only be implemented after the movement is completed. The enemy currently claims that only the first stage has been completed since the start of operations. The goal of this stage is to attempt to control the air supremacy over the Japanese mainland in order to measure Japan's air force strength. The second stage is to attempt to disrupt the transportation between the Japanese mainland and the mainland, as well as the land transportation lines within Japan. The third stage of the enemy attempts to seize strategically important points in Japan and land on the mainland to disperse and isolate Japan's military strength.</p>
<h3>The Decisive Battle Between Japan and the United States Must Await Next Spring</h3>
<p>However, judging from the enemy's intentions, the first stage has not yet been completed. The start time of the decisive battle between Japan and the United States must be in October of this year, and the large-scale decisive battle in the first phase must await next spring, April or May, before it can be launched. The destination of the enemy's decisive battle cannot be determined at this time. This is because the enemy has not yet decided on a strategic goal. As the commander of the enemy's Seventh Fleet, Kindert, stated, "My brain is not good now. The US military should attack Tokyo directly." Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz also stated: "It is advantageous for the US to land on the Japanese mainland." At the same time, the London Times also argued that it is more advantageous for the US military to land on the Japanese mainland than to operate on the mainland, as the mainland is not the main decisive battle but only an auxiliary battle.</p>
<p>Since Japan [illegible], it has completed its preparations with all its might [illegible] and has grasped the lessons learned from the Battle of Okinawa and is working hard to expand them [illegible], and Japan's special attack tactics can especially exert their effect, leaving the enemy helpless. In the past operations on Okinawa Island, enemy US military commentators also stated: "The US military suffered more naval losses than land and air forces in this operation, which was actually caused by Japan's special attack tactics." At the same time, Nimitz and enemy military and political authorities all said they could not cope. In addition, Japan can also use mountainous areas to build strong positions. Japan has many mountains, and using mountains to form strong positions, coupled with the spirit of special attacks, will give the enemy who comes to Japan a considerable invitation to strike. The enemy has also stated: "The concentration of Japanese aircraft is at least 9,000 to 10,000." Recently, the strategic bombing of the mobile unit air force has also failed to reduce that force, and Japan is also using underground factories and dispersed factory production, increasing monthly production by more than 1,500 aircraft. Both production and storage are unusually abundant, and it is said that Japan will fight with all its strength in the decisive battle.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's Concerns about the Fate of East Asia</h3>
<p>Secondly, the international situation [illegible]. Recently, Chongqing [illegible] President [illegible] Ziwen went to the Soviet Union to visit Stalin and held many talks. Later, due to the convening of the tripartite conference of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it ended in vain. Although this meeting between Truman, Churchill, and Stalin discussed issues such as the handling of Germany and European borders, the fate of Greater East Asia was also discussed. The fate of Greater East Asia was also discussed. This tripartite conference took peace as its premise and prepared for the peace conference to be held in two years, but how will the Soviet Union adopt its current attitude? In the past San Francisco conference, the results were formed in form due to the nature and characteristics of Britain and the United States, but in this meeting, there was also an impact due to the relationship in character. Moreover, the Soviet Union has a strong national character and is the national character of East Asia, so no matter how the meeting goes, we should not be pessimistic. It is deeply believed that the Soviet Union is also giving serious consideration to the fate of East Asia, and the operations of the Japanese and American armies are [illegible] in a turbulent state and are becoming increasingly fierce.</p>
<h3>The Path to Open the Dangerous Situation</h3>
<p>At this time when the war situation is changing and the world situation is developing, what should we think? What goals should we move towards? Where is the path we should take? Regarding this voice, I do not want to simply choose a path as the best way and force you to take it. Now I will present a fact that may be used as a method of thinking and reflecting.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 19th century, when Napoleon's iron hooves ravaged Berlin, the German philosopher Fichte was still lecturing on the necessity of ethnic education in his "Addresses to the German Nation" in the university church with the sound of cannons booming. It can be asserted that Fichte's German idealism philosophy laid the foundation for the century-long prosperity of Germany before World War I.</p>
<p>Now Japan has encountered unprecedented national difficulties, and people of insight are deeply considering how to open up the dangerous situation. General Yamashita, the supreme commander in the Philippines, once advocated "improving the educational level of the Japanese people" on Lyz島. The wealthy man, Tokutomi, also expressed fierce opinions, hoping that the youth would rise up. Recently, General Ishihara strenuously advocated the emperor's direct rule and domestic reform. Although Japan is in this crisis, it is igniting a true torch of reform, and the special attack spirit of dying for the country is making the future of reform brilliant and bright.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation in China, after eight years of the War of Resistance, the three government grains are standing up, creating a chaotic state, secretly stirring the case, not knowing what they want, and seem to want to open up a path to a modern country. You, who are responsible for the important task of China in the future, also hope for a modern and unified China in your hearts. However, the current situation in China and Japan can be reflected in the context of world history. China and Japan are behind in the development of capitalism and are also behind in the road to modernization. Therefore, in the past fifty or even one hundred years, China, Japan, and Sino-Japanese relations have repeatedly suffered tragic misfortunes. This is certainly the case, lagging behind others on the road to modernization, and the fact of backward capitalism, is this a tragic fate for China and Japan? I can answer:</p>
<p>This world war is opening up a promising path for us. I now have the following thoughts, I don't know what you think?</p>
<h3>Persist in Hope Without the Slightest Relaxation</h3>
<p>In a sense, the nineteenth century can be regarded as the era of liberalism, nationalism, and nationalism, which had already bred the seeds of imperialism and created World War I. Due to World War I, everyone had a deep impression of the destruction and misery of the war, so mankind loved peace, and internationalism and cosmopolitanism began to rise. But the reality of the world is by no means singular, and there are many situations that are too complicated. However, this kind of cosmopolitanism that deviates from reality is of course inevitable for World War II. According to my observation, this war bears a historical task, which is to end nationalism and cosmopolitanism dialectically in the economic, political, and social fields in order to realize the idea of ​​regionalism and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>During the six years of the war, the war situation has changed dramatically, and the form of the co-prosperity sphere has changed several times, but the rise of regionalism is believed to be an inevitable historical trend. Standing on this position, I thought of the East Asian regional sphere based on the common consciousness of China and Japan, eliminating the white people's domination of East Asia, wiping out the erosion of Europe and the United States on East Asia, and opening up the way for China and Japan to refer to it, and we could see the dawn of East Asia.</p>
<p>Today, the war situation is extremely harsh, and the world situation is changing. The reality of East Asia cannot but be said to be the most profound tragedy. However, under the heavy pressure of this harsh reality, we must go far beyond the war situation and cross the distance of the coup. Conversely, the more miserable the reality, the more we should have hope for the distant other side. We now feel that "the day is late, and the road is still far." Being oppressed by reality is almost suffocating, but hope should always be persisted without the slightest relaxation, and I believe that those who work tirelessly will surely have light shining on them.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Chongqing Political Council and the National Assembly Issue</h3>
<p>The first session of the fourth National Political Council in Chongqing opened on July 7th and closed on July 20th. During this period, a total of nineteen meetings were held. Among them, ten were reports on the administration of the various ministries of the government, and only nine were formal deliberations.</p>
<p>In the reporting sector, the stern questions from the council members can reflect the public's dissatisfaction with the recent administration in Chongqing. Among them, finance and economy and diplomacy were the most criticized, and there were many problems with the reports of the conscription, internal affairs, social, agriculture, and forestry ministries, which the authorities could not answer. What is more noteworthy is Chen Cheng's military report and the so-called preparation for the general counter-offensive, which shows that Chongqing is still trying to use the names of the general counter-offensive to restore people's hearts.</p>
<p>In the deliberation sector, the "Please approve the United Nations Constitution" and "Please conduct the trial and conclude the military alliance treaty between China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France" were passed. The former is nothing more than a timely document to adapt to the new international situation, and the latter is inevitably too empty. In addition, issues such as improving conscription, improving the treatment of officers and soldiers, post-war national reconstruction, and developing industrial production are nothing more than repeating the resolutions that the Political Council had previously passed.</p>
<p>This Chongqing Political Council can be said to be the dimmest since the Political Council was established. First of all, the Communist Party members refused to attend. Although the government persuaded the neutral Huang Yanpei and others to go to lobby, the result was still ineffective; not only was it ineffective, but Huang Yanpei and other neutral parties took the opportunity to have direct talks with the CCP leaders, and a certain degree of tacit understanding was established between the CCP and the third force, namely the Democratic League. Therefore, when Huang and others returned to Chongqing, some members of the third force also expressed their refusal to attend. Although Huang reluctantly participated in a meeting in the end "in order to take into account the necessity of the National Assembly and the participation of all parties and factions" and "had to sacrifice his own opinions", he still declared that he "strongly disagreed with the report of the Political Council's Shenhui Committee on the National Assembly" to show his reserved position. This is rare in this Political Council. At least, Chongqing's use of the Political Council to flaunt its democracy to China and foreign countries has failed.</p>
<p>The reason for the failure of this Political Council lies in the issue of the National Assembly, and the reason why the council members' opinions on this issue are so inconsistent is superficially because the date of the meeting is set for November 12 this year, which is too hasty, and the result is inevitable to pass the constitution hastily, which is unfaithful to the future of the country, the people, and democracy. Secondly, as for the representatives of the National Assembly, the government maintains in principle the personnel appointed by the Kuomintang before the incident. Now, after eight or nine years, the situation and personnel have undergone great changes, which is very different from the meaning of true people's representatives. Now the Political Council has passed the report according to the examination report, that is, the date is entrusted to the government to carefully stipulate according to the actual situation, and another compromise method is set for the election of representatives of the National Assembly. Therefore, November 12 will inevitably be too late to hold.</p>
<p>In order to confront the Chongqing's convocation of the National Assembly, the CCP also has preparations to convene the so-called "People's Representative Assembly of the Liberated Areas of China" in Yan'an on a regular basis. The scale and method seem to be in opposition to Chongqing, but the specific goals of this meeting have not been announced. In addition to confronting Chongqing and showing the infighting in the War of Resistance camp, what other practical significance does it have? However, we must point out that our country's vitality is so impaired that it really cannot withstand the powerful people playing with the children's plays and the bloody civil war again and again!</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Area: War Results of Japanese Mopping-Up</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: Recently, the Yan'an forces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have gradually moved south, and the New Fourth Army has also become increasingly active in various places. The Japanese army is currently attacking them everywhere in order to thwart their attempts. In early June, the Japanese army attacked and routed approximately 2,000 men belonging to the Second Division of the New Fourth Army near Liuhe, Jiangbei. Furthermore, starting from June 5th, they attacked the Jingjiang Independent Regiment, which consisted of approximately 2,000 men. Since the beginning of this year, they have continued to suppress the forces of the Yan'an army in various locations. In addition, with the imminent timing of the U.S. military's landing operation on Okinawa Island, the Japanese army is also rapidly preparing for defensive warfare. On May 1st, the Japanese army carried out a mopping-up operation against the 23rd Regiment of the Huaihai Sub-district and local bandit forces near the northern border of Huaihai Province. By May 22nd, they had destroyed the guerrilla bases in the area.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Announces: Content of the Talks</h3>

<h3>Churchill Inspects British Troops in Berlin</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to news from Berlin: British Prime Minister Churchill personally inspected the British and American troops yesterday (three regiments of British troops participating in the war). They paraded on the streets of Berlin, Charlottenburg, and Unter den Linden. General Montgomery, General Lyne, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Labor Party leader Attlee accompanied Prime Minister Churchill in the inspection.</p>
<h3>Potsdam Conference Reaches Critical Moment: Deliberations Progress Extremely Rapidly</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to a U.S. representative in Potsdam, who spoke last night, the three great powers have been holding daily talks since Thursday, typically lasting three hours. At the same time, the foreign ministers and various committee members of the three countries are also working actively under the same direction.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, although there is no official confirmation, observations from well-informed sources in London suggest that the three-party talks currently taking place in Potsdam may temporarily conclude this weekend, so that British Prime Minister Churchill and Labor Party leader Attlee can return to London temporarily next Thursday to learn the results of the general election. However, other speculations suggest that even if Truman, Churchill, and Stalin return to their respective countries, the talks will not be temporarily suspended, as there are still major issues that need to be decided by them.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to news from Berlin: A U.S. representative participating in the Potsdam Conference made a powerful statement yesterday, revealing that the conference's progress is extremely rapid, and also pointing out that the conference has now reached a critical moment. The main points are as follows: The three-party conference is proceeding continuously, and extremely serious issues are currently under discussion. How to deal with Germany and the future of Germany will be the top priority of these important issues. The heads of the three countries are making efforts to eliminate all difficulties in order to find a proper solution to the issues concerning all of Germany and even all of Europe. Experts specializing in the study of war-defeated countries' responsibility for compensation for losses all hold extremely important positions in this conference. Mr. Lunt, the U.S. wartime shipping administrator who was urgently summoned by President Truman, is also participating in the conference. According to the news released yesterday, Lieutenant General Clay, representing General Eisenhower, had dinner with President Truman last night. Based on this, we can observe that the three great powers will discuss various major issues related to Germany today, and the procedure is approximately as follows:</p>
<h3>Occupation Issues</h3>
<p>This is the basic action of occupying German territory. All political observers in Berlin deeply believe that the three great powers are currently still vigorously reviewing the three countries' policies and the individual development of the deformed status quo in the occupation zones, in order to achieve unity.</p>
<h3>Compensation Issues</h3>
<p>This is the necessary policy involving the purpose of occupying Germany and the compensation regulations. Regarding this issue, the three great powers are currently encountering two major obstacles: (A) Unless German industrial machinery and commercial markets are restored, Germany will not be able to bear any compensation; (B) If fearing the resurgence of war and reorganizing the entire German industry, Germany will never be able to compensate for losses.</p>
<h3>Military Issues</h3>
<p>This is currently the most complex and important issue. In reality, the military governments of Britain and the United States are still an executive government. Currently, the military governments of the two countries are suspending work and waiting for instructions and guidance after the three-party conference.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Discharges Now Reach 200,000</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to a telegram from New York: U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Patterson stated on the 21st that the U.S. Army returning from Europe is being discharged at a rate of 4,000 men per day. To date, approximately 200,000 soldiers have been discharged.</p>
<h3>Thailand to Implement People's Training</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 21st, Central News Agency telegram: The Thai People's Assembly reviewed the government's urgent motion to establish a constitutional amendment review committee on the 19th. After deliberation, it unanimously passed the motion, and the government will immediately appoint 27 members to serve as committee members. Subsequently, it proceeded to review the wartime Thai training bill proposed by the government to implement people's training. As a result, it was decided to transfer it to the next meeting for review. The main purpose of this wartime people's training bill is to require young Thai men aged 20 to 30 to receive military training in the use of modern weapons, with the exception of monks, active-duty soldiers, and active-duty police officers.</p>
<h3>Belgian People All Advocate Supporting the Crown Prince as Regent</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to a dispatch from Brussels: Belgian Prime Minister Achille Van Acker, in a speech to the Lower House on the 20th, impeached King Leopold of Belgium. The Belgian people unanimously advocated supporting Crown Prince Baudouin, who is only fourteen years old this year. Furthermore, the bill on holding a national referendum on the matter of the King's return to the throne was passed on the 20th and will be sent to the Senate soon.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Persists in Demanding Control of the Tatar Strait from Turkey: Also Seeks to Recover Territory Lost 25 Years Ago</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd, Central News Agency telegram: According to Reuters correspondent Mr. Holber in Moscow: "The Soviet News Agency today disclosed a piece of news in major Soviet newspapers, stating, 'Marshal Stalin will undoubtedly insist on maintaining the future security of the Tatar Strait.' At the same time, the news also quoted an article written by Christian Science Monitor correspondent Stevens in a certain publication, stating, 'The Soviet authorities' current concern for the Tatar Strait is no less than the U.S. authorities' concern for the Panama Canal.'" Stevens also discussed Kars, which belongs to Armenia, and was ceded to Turkey in 1920, becoming a province of Turkey. However, the Soviet Union suddenly claimed that Kars was part of Soviet Armenia. At the same time, the Soviet authorities also claimed that the Soviet Union would ensure that the demand for merging all regions within Soviet Armenia into one would be supported by most Armenians. Therefore, it is legal for the Soviet Union to demand control of the Tatar Strait. Finally, Stevens issued a warning, stating that Turkey must be careful not to be supported by Britain to organize the so-called "anti-Soviet Turkish-Greek bloc." The Soviet Union's current demand for the return of the Kars, Ardahan, Artvin and other regions is the Soviet Union's due right."</p>
<p>Suburban Correspondence</p>
<h3>Grain Transportation After the Lifting of Restrictions</h3>
<p>— Zhicheng</p>
<p>Since the National Government authorities, in view of the soaring rice prices in various places and the deep threat to people's livelihoods, implemented emergency measures to temporarily stop purchasing and abolish movement restrictions, the purpose was to open up rice sources and allow free circulation. After implementation, rice and grain were transported to Shanghai from all directions, and Shanghai rice prices immediately dropped. Recently, all sectors of society have paid attention to the various aspects of the situation after the lifting of restrictions, in order to enrich the people's food and achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods. Therefore, this reporter was dispatched to the rice-producing areas in the suburbs of Shanghai—Songjiang, Jinshan, Shenjiang, Chuansha, Nanhui, etc.—to investigate. Here is a report on the main points of what I have observed:</p>
<h3>Before and After the Lifting of Restrictions</h3>
<p>Before the central government issued the emergency measures for rice and grain, the movement of rice and grain in various places was restricted. In particular, Songjiang and Jinshan were designated as military rice areas, and rice and grain from the countryside could not be moved into the region or city at will, resulting in the price difference between various places and Shanghai always being more than one-third. Moreover, there was also a difference between the east gate and west gate of Songjiang urban area. Therefore, it was often the case that individual porters transported rice to Shanghai in small batches and intermittently through smuggling. Moreover, merchants with abundant capital and influence used their advantages to hoard and speculate, manipulating prices. In the past month, Songjiang rice prices rose from 350,000 to 600,000, Jinshan rose from 380,000 to over 500,000, etc.</p>
<p>After the lifting of restrictions, with free movement and circulation, rice and grain were transported from various places, Shanghai rice prices fell back, and the movement of rice and grain from various rural areas into urban areas also became much smoother, resulting in rice prices in various places falling back one after another. For example, Jinshan fell back from over 500,000 to 400,000, Songjiang fell back from 600,000 to around 500,000, and Minhang fell back from 700,000 to 500,000. However, at this time of year when the old crop has been exhausted and the new crop has not yet arrived, the quantity of rice in various rice-producing areas is limited. Due to the natural trend of exporting, the prices in rice-producing areas (Songjiang) were leveled with those in Shanghai. For example, on the day this reporter left Songjiang (July 11), white rice was priced at 540,000 per shi (small hu, 150 jin per shi). If transported to Shanghai, plus transportation costs, weight difference (Shanghai medium hu, 156 jin per shi), expenses along the way, and the porters' food, the cost would already be around 600,000 when arriving in Caohejing. This is the general situation in the suburbs of Shanghai. However, the situation is slightly different for those coming from railway lines. Therefore, individual porters have changed to purchasing from rice-producing areas (Suzhou, Wuxi, Jiashan, etc.) by railway.</p>
<h3>Transportation Situation</h3>
<p>The sources of rice and grain in Shanghai are mostly Changzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, Kunshan, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Qingpu, Songjiang, Jinshan, Fengxian and other counties. According to this reporter, there are approximately the following routes for rice and grain entering Shanghai from rice-producing areas: Songhu Road, Songsih Road, Hu-Min-Nan-Tuo Road, Shangnan Road, Qinghu Road, inland river transport ships, and the Jinghu and Huhang railways. Here is a separate description of each route that this reporter has traveled.</p>
<p>During the time of rice and grain control, rice and grain from Songjiang Qishan and other places were smuggled through small roads due to strict blocking, and transported to Zhoupu. As a result, Zhoupu became a large distribution center for rice and grain. Shangnan Road and Zhoupu to Beicai to Longwangmiao were originally major roads for smuggling rice and grain. After the opening of traffic on May 5th, Songjiang and Jinshan can directly transport rice to Shanghai without having to continue through other routes. Therefore, the amount of rice entering the town has decreased daily. In the past, there were more than 1,000 shi per day, but now there are only about 100 shi. Shangnan Road has instead become the main road for transporting sweet potatoes, flour, and miscellaneous grains to the urban area. According to a private flour seller, "One bag of flour can earn a net profit of 10,000 yuan from Zhanggangzha in Chuansha to Zhoupu, after deducting food expenses."</p>
<p>Returning from Fengxian and passing through Hu-Min-Nan-Tuo Road, I saw many male and female rice porters using buses and bicycles as tools to carry rice from Zhuangjiahang, Nanqiao, Yexie, Zhangze, Wujiaqiao and other places and return. After crossing the river to Minhang, they arrive directly in Shanghai via the highway. Only a few sell in Minhang, about 20 to 30 shi per day. Therefore, most rice shops have switched to operating miscellaneous grains. Each bicycle can carry more than one shi, and the porters only carry one or two dou, making only one trip a day at most. On Hu-Min Road, rice porters come and go endlessly, forming a lifeline for Shanghai's food supply.</p>
<p>Leaving Minhang and taking a bus along Songhu Road to Songjiang, I saw a truck carrying more than ten shi of rice. People and rice each occupied half of the truck. It is said that the freight for this type of truck is very high, about 30,000 yuan per shi, plus a "tip" of 4,000 yuan per shi for the escort to buy wine. If encountering illegal extortion, the truck owner is responsible for dealing with it.</p>
<p>Another route for Songjiang's exports is from Songjiang to Sijing, Qibao, etc., using bicycles, paddle boats, and cars to transfer to Shanghai. The amount transported is about several hundred dan per day. Recently, because railway transportation is smoother, the number of transfers has gradually become flat.</p>
<p>Individual porters who purchase rice from the Jinshan Pinghu area use inland river transport ships to Pinghu as transportation. Every time they arrive at a wharf, the rice porters going up and down are bustling and crowded, as if a large ocean liner has arrived at the port. Both the bottom of the cabin and the top of the deck are filled with bags of rice.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, transportation tools urgently need to be increased, and transportation agencies should be improved, such as the increase in freight rates, and the "additional reward" for escorts or boaters. In fact, the so-called "additional reward" is tantamount to extortion. Otherwise, they will turn a blind eye to it on the roadside. In today's "regulating people's food and smoothing transportation," the authorities should actively crack down on it.</p>
<h3>Mid-Journey Extortion</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the opening of rice transportation, government bureaus repeatedly ordered strict investigation and prohibition in order to prevent military police along the way from creating difficulties and extortion, as well as local governments restricting circulation under the pretext of maintaining food within their borders. In reality, the checkpoints on the main roads in the suburbs have improved a lot compared to the past, but there are still a few military police who still demand small amounts, about 500 yuan per shi. Most vendors think that the amount is very small and have not reported it to their respective agencies. However, this trend cannot be allowed to grow. If it persists for a long time, it will inevitably expand, so it should be secretly investigated and cracked down on.</p>
<p>On the journey from Jinshan back to Songjiang, a rice vendor told this reporter: "At a certain checkpoint not far from Caijing Town, when a rice truck passed this checkpoint, the checkpoint staff asked for 50,000 per car. After many compromises, the result was that each car passed with more than 10,000 yuan." Moreover, outside the east gate of Songjiang, not far from the railway, a checkpoint would check the number of loads under the pretext of inspection when a rice truck passed by, and collect money from the escort. For example, if each load was more than ten shi, it would cost 60,000 to 70,000 yuan to pass.</p>
<p>In Zhoupu, special personnel are assigned to collect "security police subsidy fees" at the main fields for entering and exiting. All rice and grain and commodities entering and exiting or passing through must be collected. Commodities are charged at 10 per mille, rice and grain are exempt from collection when entering, and 5 per mille is charged when exiting. For example, if the local rice price is 600,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan is charged per shi, plus a handling fee of 600 yuan, totaling 3,600 yuan. However, under the order of the National Government authorities, whether exiting or entering, it should be exempted to facilitate circulation.</p>
<p>On the eve of preparing to return, this reporter met a rice vendor on the street and talked about the transportation situation. According to his description: "On July 8th, I bought a third-class ticket from Shanghai Xinlonghua Station to Jiashan. When entering the station, the police demanded 1,000 yuan. Then, after queuing, I spent 3,000 yuan to ask a black hat to write the number on my clothes with white powder. The ticket price was 3,000 yuan, totaling 7,000 yuan before I could get on the train. When I arrived in Jiashan, I bought rice in Shangzhen, traded one shi for 470,000 yuan, and used a rickshaw to transport it to the military station. Expenses along the way were 3,000 yuan. When entering the station, one shi of rice had to spend another 4,000 yuan, otherwise the rice bags would be thrown away or people would be beaten. When the baggage clerk weighed it, each piece of rice was 13,000 yuan, and the black market ticket price was more than 14,000 yuan per ticket. Before the rice bags were loaded onto the train, all kinds of people could extort at any time, each time costing 10,000 to 5,000 yuan before they could be sent off, otherwise they would cut the rice bags with a short knife. The rice in the baggage car must be guarded, otherwise when arriving at the station, there would be thousands of holes in the bag, and there would be little left in the bag. In short, one shi of rice costs more than 100,000 yuan to reach Shanghai, excluding food. And what is earned is only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Moreover, the suffering of the journey is all that outsiders cannot know in detail." After saying this, he was filled with grief and indignation, but for the sake of life, he still endured his tears and did it.</p>
<h3>Eradicating Hoarding</h3>
<p>Since rice and grain have been purchased, some farmers only self-sufficient, and because the efficiency of wartime agricultural production has decreased, the reserves in various rice-producing areas are not abundant. It is not easy to collect a large number in a short period of time for export. At present, Shanghai's food supply is almost entirely supplied by countless porters.</p>
<p>As prices rise, most farmers are willing to store rice and gradually sell it out when there is an urgent need or when fertilizing agriculture. When rice prices fall, most households and industrial and commercial institutions, in view of past trends, purchase and store large quantities at low prices. A few rice merchants with strong funds go deep into the interior to purchase and hoard after free circulation. Moreover, some rice shops, because the local supply is too high, use the excuse of closing down, and on the one hand contact local powerful people to hoard and manipulate. As mentioned above, all of these cause rice and grain to be concentrated, losing the purpose of regulation. This can only be achieved by those involved understanding the importance of righteousness, and realizing and abandoning "ego" behavior, and should be thoroughly dedicated to the entire society, then the goal of abundant people's food and stable people's livelihood can be achieved.</p>

<h3>About 100 Enemy Planes: Blindly Bomb the City Again, Destroying Several Houses and Killing and Injuring More Than 100 People</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Army and Navy Air Defense Command announced at 6:00 PM on the 22nd: "Between 11:00 AM and 12:30 PM on the 22nd, a combined enemy fighter and bomber force (B24 type, P51 type, and giant type fighter planes) of about 100 planes invaded the Shanghai area and carried out bombing and machine-gun strafing of airports around Shanghai and key facilities on the Huangpu River. Our war results: four enemy planes shot down, seven destroyed."</p>
<p>(Another report) Yesterday, a combined enemy fighter-bomber formation of about 100 planes attacked the Shanghai area again, first bombing the suburbs, and then bombing residential areas in eastern and southern Shanghai. However, most of the bombs fell on squares and barren land, causing little damage. Several houses were destroyed, and several fires broke out. Fortunately, the citizens had learned from the second bombing and took shelter early, and the number of casualties reached more than one hundred. The Shanghai Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, Fire Department, Rescue Department, and Work Department were fully mobilized, together with the police, security, and air defense personnel in each district, to vigorously fight the fire, transport the injured to nearby hospitals in each district for emergency treatment, and concentrate the dead for family members to claim. As for the displaced victims, relief agencies will find ways to accommodate and provide relief.</p>
<h3>News and Magazine Circles Hold Cultural Lecture Yesterday: Captain Matsumoto Attends and Lectures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association and the Shanghai Magazine Joint Society jointly held a cultural lecture at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd) to entertain cultural colleagues in the news and magazine circles. Captain Matsumoto of the Japanese Fleet Reporting Department in China was specially invited to give a lecture. Captain Matsumoto arrived on time with Wang Nanan and other staff members. More than a thousand people attended from the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, including Chairman Chen Binhe, Standing Director Chen Riping, and cultural figures from the news and magazine circles. The meeting began at 10:00 AM. First, Director-General of the Magazine Joint Society Wan Yi reported the order of programs, followed by Director-General Lu Feng of the Shanghai Branch of the News Association giving the opening speech, stating briefly: "During wartime, people generally believe that material resources are more important than everything else, and spiritual resources are secondary. But this is not the case. Cultural spirit is even more needed during wartime. We should actively promote culture and use spirit to overcome the cruel war." Then Captain Matsumoto was invited to give a lecture, which lasted for an hour before it ended. The entertainment program included Ms. Li Xianglan singing popular Chinese and Japanese songs, and screening cultural films.</p>
<h3>Financial Market Conditions: Sharp Rise Last Week</h3>
<p>The market conditions of the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors in this city have continued to evolve in the past week due to the stimulation of various rumors. The intensity of the price increase is even greater than in the previous week, and due to the encouragement and agitation of speculators, people's minds are uncertain. Capitalists are constantly absorbing spot goods, resulting in depleted warehouses and transactions gradually becoming "no goods to deliver."</p>
<h3>Gold Certificates</h3>
<p>The price of gold certificates started to rise on Monday. Compared with the closing price of the previous Saturday, the current and fourth-period certificates rose by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan per tael. After a flat Tuesday, they rose again. Although news of the issuance of fifth-period gold certificates was spread on Wednesday, it still failed to suppress the buying momentum, which was seen to be rising. At this time, the atmosphere was quite tense. The rise was even more intense on Thursday and Friday. On Saturday, it broke through the 9 million mark, and then retreated into the 9 million range. The price rose by more than 90% within a week. Silver treasury bonds and other currencies also followed suit.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>The situation with Chinese stocks at two o'clock mirrored the surge in the gold market, even more so. However, it suffered a slight setback midway due to air raids. Popular stocks of companies like Mei-Ya, Wing On, and the textile mills sailed smoothly, rising steadily. Other small and medium-sized stocks all increased by more than 60%. The amount of cash in circulation is insufficient due to the continued rise in prices, but there is no panic, making it difficult to fundamentally resolve. It is not easy to tighten credit because financial institutions are still issuing promissory notes indiscriminately. The Central Bank authorities are closely monitoring this issue.</p>
<h3>Rice, Grain and Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>As for the industrial and commercial sectors, the electricity needs of factories still cannot be fully resolved, and preparations for resumption of work are difficult to achieve as scheduled. Except for a slight slowdown in the rising prices of rice and miscellaneous grains, other daily necessities such as oil, sugar, soap, matches, candles, cotton fabrics, woolens, silks and satins, paper prices, and hardware seem to be rising continuously. In particular, the prices marked for goods sold in various industries have no standards, and they are changed and increased several times a day. Countless citizens are harmed when buying goods. It is hoped that the authorities will implement pricing policies and enforce them strictly.</p>
<h3>The City Buddhist Association Decides to Relieve Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the City Buddhist Association held an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss temporary shelter work for air raid victims. More than 20 people attended, including Zhengdao, Mijia, Baisheng, and Chao Cheng. First, Mijia, the resident managing director, reported on the inspection of the disaster area in Pudong. It was then decided to divide the city's member temples into several areas and issue an order to each temple to organize temporary shelter for air raid victims so that shelter work can be carried out immediately when an air raid occurs. The association also plans to form a Buddhist air raid rescue team in the near future to go to the disaster area and assist the authorities in rescue work.</p>
<h3>Yu Shijie, Chief of Staff of the Tax Police Corps, Takes Office Today</h3>
<p>Since Neng Jiandong took over as the chief of the Central Tax Police Corps, Yu Shijie, the chief of the staff office of the Shanghai Special City Security Command, has been promoted to the chief of staff of the corps in order to improve internal soundness. Mr. Yu is scheduled to take office today.</p>
<h3>Road Loving Association to be Established Today</h3>
<p>The Road Loving Work Promotion Association, initiated by the staff of the China Railway Road Loving and enthusiastic people, has been actively preparing for more than two months and is now ready. It is scheduled to hold its founding meeting at the Duchen Hotel at 3:00 pm today (23rd) and will entertain people from all walks of life. Zheng Hongnian, the president of China Railway, will also be present to preside over the meeting.</p>
<h3>"Home Doctor" Scholarship Movement Begins Accepting Applications Today</h3>
<p>Hoping students from various schools come to the library to contact us</p>
<p>Our newspaper and the YMCA/YWCA have recently received a donation of 100,000 copies of "Home Doctor" from Bayer Pharmaceuticals. The "Home Doctor Scholarship Movement Office," jointly formed by our newspaper and the three organizations, will begin operations today and convene students sponsored by our newspaper and students from major middle schools to jointly solicit scholarships from all walks of life. Donors of 5,000 yuan will receive a copy of "Home Doctor." Half of the funds will directly subsidize students participating in the fundraising, and the rest will be donated to the work-study loan program organized by the YMCA/YWCA and the reader scholarship program of our newspaper, specifically for rescuing out-of-school students. The beauty and completeness of the contents of "Home Doctor" and its significance as a household necessity will be explained in another article. The student application guidelines are listed below, hoping that students from various schools will pay attention! All impoverished students above the middle school level in this city can apply to participate in the "Home Doctor" Scholarship Movement. Students who are interested in participating can pick up application forms at the following locations within one week from the 23rd to the 28th of this month: (A) Information Desk of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, (B) Information Desk of the YWCA at 638 Weihaiwei Road, (C) Information Desk of the Shenbao War Support Center at 309 Hankou Road. Qualified applicants and those with book receipts can pick up books with their certificates. Each university student is tentatively limited to 50 copies, and each middle school student is limited to 30 copies. Students who have already applied for the reader scholarship of our newspaper do not need to apply again and can pick up books with their student ID.</p>
<h3>Jusheng Bank Colleagues Help Students</h3>
<p>A letter from all colleagues of Jusheng Bank states: "We recently read an article in your newspaper, 'Please Encourage the Silver and Money Industry to Initiate a Scholarship Movement,' which states that the silver industry is the mother of all industries, the convergence of all streams. Once initiated, all industries will respond like echoes from the mountains. It also requests that the heads of hundreds of banks in Shanghai unanimously participate in the scholarship movement, etc. Feeling inspired by this, our colleagues have collected 700,000 yuan in Central Reserve banknotes and decided to donate them to your newspaper's reader scholarship fund. The bank authorities sympathize with this and have allocated 300,000 yuan in Central Reserve banknotes to make up 1 million yuan. It is named the Jusheng Bank Colleagues Team. We are enclosing a check with this letter, hoping you will check and receive it."</p>
<p>The Jusheng Bank colleagues are the first to respond to the scholarship assistance and pledge to become an honorary team, which is deeply admired. Hundreds of banks in the silver and money industry will surely not lag behind in their enthusiasm for scholarship assistance. It is hoped that they will rise up together so that everyone can easily lift the burden and the scholarship fund can reach its goal as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Ninth Shenbao Reader Scholarship Special Fundraising Team</h3>

<h3>China Central Railway Company Increases Ticket Prices by Two Times, Implemented on the 25th of this Month</h3>
<p>In order to enhance wartime transportation capacity, enrich air defense facilities, and cope with rising prices and the expansion of operating expenses, the China Central Railway Company has decided to uniformly increase the railway, passenger, freight, and automobile transportation costs across the entire line from the 25th of this month. As a result, the railway passenger and freight transportation costs will be increased by 200% of the current ticket prices. This has been approved by the relevant parties and submitted to the Ministry of Construction for record. In order to simplify procedures, passenger transportation costs include the pass-through tax and are based on the third-class fare as the standard. The second-class fare is twice the third-class fare, and the first-class fare is three times the third-class fare. The revised passenger transportation costs from Shanghai to various main stations are as follows: (All are third-class fares) Suzhou: 7,000 yuan Wuxi: 10,500 yuan Changzhou: 13,500 yuan Zhenjiang: 20,000 yuan Nanjing: 25,500 yuan Suhu: 33,500 yuan Bengbu: 40,000 yuan Xuzhou: 53,500 yuan Hangzhou: 15,000 yuan Jiaxing: 6,500 yuan</p>
<p>(Express train fare) Third class: 4,500 yuan (Second class is three times more, and first class is three times more).</p>
<p>Sports</p>
<h3>Volleyball League Ends</h3>

<h3>Disaster Relief Enthusiasm is Raging, Mr. Sheng You Makes a Huge Donation Alone</h3>
<p>Donations for air raid disaster relief are being enthusiastically contributed by all walks of life. Although yesterday was a Sunday and there were air raid alerts during the day, people still came to personally deliver donations in an endless stream. In particular, Mr. Sheng You donated 10 million yuan, and Mrs. Li Yun and her son Tie Jun jointly donated 10 million yuan. The latter also specified that 5 million yuan be used exclusively for burying the dead victims at the Pushan Villa. Their family's kindness is admirable. Mr. Sheng also provided two suggestions for disaster relief work: All those injured in air raids should be sent to the hospital. Regardless of minor or serious injuries, the hospital should accept and treat them first and should absolutely not ask the injured to pay for medical expenses first. Afterward, the health bureau should explain and ask the relief organizations organized by the Civil Welfare Association to pay for the expenses. All families who have lost their lives in air raids and unfortunately only have elderly, young, and disabled people left should be supported by society, but they must first register and apply with the Civil Welfare Association. The above suggestions are very insightful, and it is hoped that relevant organizations will adopt them.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Sympathize with the Air Raid Victims</h3>
<p>Yikangtai Silk Store wrote: "Our city has suffered a devastating air raid, and the victims are displaced, wives and children are separated. Our colleagues cannot bear to sit idly by, so we have collected 3.02 million national currency. We hope you will accept it and forward it to the relief organizations."</p>
<p>Mr. Chi Zhenwei wrote: "Dear Sir, the continuous bombings have caused severe disasters. I am heartbroken by what I have witnessed. I am sending a check for 300,000 yuan, requesting that you distribute 200,000 yuan to the air raid relief fund, 50,000 yuan to the emergency medical fund, and 50,000 yuan to the Pushan Villa. I hope that all sectors and all citizens of Shanghai will fulfill their due obligations and donate generously so that everyone can contribute and jointly support this righteous cause."</p>
<h3>Selling Cosmetics for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Mingde wrote: "Our city has been bombed daily, and the disaster area is vast, with many dead and injured. At a time when the cost of living is high, suffering such a disaster is truly unspeakable. Your newspaper and others have called for air raid relief. I am willing to send two imported cosmetics that I have in stock, namely one bottle of German-made 4711 Quining Hair Tonic and one bottle of American-made Dean Cream, to your office for auction, with a price of 300,000 yuan. The proceeds will be used for air raid relief. I understand that these goods have been out of stock in the market for a long time and will surely be happily purchased by enthusiastic ladies and gentlemen. I have been keeping them unused for a long time, and now I am turning the useless into useful, also expressing my sympathy."</p>

<h3>Launching a Mass Baoding Self-Defense Movement</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shu</p>
<p>Yuan Shu, the president of Xinzhongguo Daily, gave a lecture at the Shanghai Radio Station at 7:00 pm yesterday (22nd) in the name of a member of the Municipal Baoding Propaganda Committee, entitled "Launching a Mass Baoding Self-Defense Movement." The secretary-general of the Shanghai Newspaper and Magazine Union, Wan Yi, broadcasted on behalf of him. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Baoding Movement</h3>
<p>Today's discussion of the Baoding issue is no longer just theoretical talk, but a time to truly practice and strengthen the Baoding self-defense movement. "Mass Baoding Self-Defense," in short, is organized mass self-defense. During wartime, no matter what country, if there is no perfect Baoding organization, its land and people will suffer great damage once military action occurs. Therefore, during the war, there must be not only a strong front line, but also a strong rear. The so-called rear is a strong Baoding organization. Speaking of world wars, the Sino-Japanese Incident is just an internal strife in East Asia. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the significance of the Sino-Japanese Incident itself has been dissolved, and now it is a time for the white race to persecute the East and for the Eastern nations, especially the Chinese nation, to defend themselves and strive for independence and liberation. Located in the Chinese coastal area of Southeast Asia, there is a possibility of being subjected to landing operations or strategic bombing by the US military at any time. The result of the US military's landing operations will inevitably lead to a fierce war and cause the Chinese people to suffer an unprecedented disaster. We ask every Chinese, who is willing to sit idly by while the land and people of our country are ravaged? We do not have the power of self-defense.</p>
<h3>Promoting Four Important Tasks</h3>
<p>The strategic bombing of major coastal cities in China by the enemy's US Air Force has recently begun, and carpet bombing is being carried out in the South China area. Recently, the Chinese people have also suffered great sacrifices from the air raids on the Shanghai area by US aircraft. In order to save the current crisis, launching the mass Baoding self-defense movement is what every Chinese citizen should do. When promoting the mass Baoding movement, we must accomplish the following four tasks:</p>
<p>Complete the wartime living system. In China, where the war situation is urgent, it is a question whether every citizen can implement the wartime system. Taking Shanghai as an example, we rarely see the mood of the masses to fight to the end. Therefore, we hope that through the activities of the entire Baoding, each Baoding unit can complete its wartime life. The Baoding training life style of the Japanese people is a good model.</p>
<p>Promote Baoding youth training. Youth training is the central work of mass self-defense. The best step to mobilize the country's educated youth is to start with Baoding youth training. Although some people have proposed arming the youth in the decisive battle stage, if this task is done jointly by the government and Baoding, it is a proper way to open up the future of Chinese youth.</p>
<p>Speed up the completion of defense facilities. Wartime Baoding is very important for various facilities such as air defense, fire prevention, and poison prevention. Plain cities have no natural air defense characteristics, so air defense facilities should be built as much as possible. In order to reduce the damage from air raids, we can only start with Baoding's air defense work.</p>
<p>Strictly organize the Baoding organization. Although the Baoding organization in cities and rural areas has been completed in terms of system, it has not yet been sound in practice. We cannot deny that there are still Communist Party or reactionary elements active in many areas. Therefore, the fundamental countermeasure for mass self-defense is to strictly organize the Baoding organization so that each Baoding unit becomes a conscript in the war, and the Baoding staff should be actively trained.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Defense of the Mainland</h3>
<p>From Germany's point of view, the Chinese coastal area is an important strategic area for the US military's operations. This area has the most abundant resources and the densest population. It can be called the vanguard fortress of the Chinese mainland. Due to the large population, coupled with a perfect Baoding organization, it is possible to strengthen the defense. The completion of various defense works recently can be said to be direct and indirect evidence of the mass Baoding assisting the war. Our Chinese people value their homeland and their clans, which is the basic spirit of loving the country and the nation. We earnestly hope that all compatriots across the country will launch a unified mass Baoding self-defense movement in the new century of world history, and do their best to assist the Allied brave soldiers and fight hard to defend the motherland and East Asia.</p>

<h3>A Summary of the Important Work Conducted by the Baojia Office Over the Past Year (July 1944 to June 1945)</h3>
<p>— Gu Jiwu</p>
<p>The Baojia Office currently governs eighteen districts (including Pu, Xincheng, Lao Zha, Putuo, Jiangning, Jing'an, Taishan, Changshu, Caojiawan, Huashan, Changning, Xujiahui, Yi Miao, Penglai, Xieqiao, Zhabei, Xinshijie, and a portion of Dongchang District), totaling ninety Lianbao, 1,049 Bao, 16,067 Jia, and 471,083 households. The population consists of 1,077,702 males, 918,513 females, 264,233 male children, and 228,564 female children, totaling 2,489,012 people. The six districts north of Suzhou Creek, including North Sichuan Road, West Hongkou, Hongkou, Tilanqiao, Yulin Road, and Yangshupu, as well as a part of Dongchang District, are under the Baojia management of the Naval Garrison Area. The suburban areas are under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Government Baojia Committee. Due to the differences between the Baojia organization and the jurisdiction of the police bureau in some districts, the issuance of residence permits has not been fully implemented. The municipal government is currently striving to unify and rectify this situation.</p>
<p>The Baojia Office is gradually compiling statistics on the citizens within its jurisdiction, including their place of origin, age, occupation, birth, death, religion, nationality, factories, and shops. Such statistics are unprecedented in China, and the initial stages of implementation have been somewhat difficult.</p>
<p>The Baojia expenses, approved by the municipal government, are derived from and used for local purposes, adhering to the principle of "expenditure based on income." From July to December 1944, a monthly fee of ten yuan was levied on dependent households, thirty yuan on regular households, fifty yuan on shop households, and a special fee (determined by the Chief of the General Lianbao and the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of the police sub-bureaus, based on actual estimates within the principle that the total amount levied should not exceed the total amount levied per Bao). The total amount collected for six months was 58,295,635 yuan. From January to June 1945, a monthly fee of fifty yuan was levied on dependent households, one hundred yuan on regular households, two hundred yuan on shop households, and a special fee (the collection method was the same as in 1944). The total amount collected for six months was 283,166,310 yuan. Eighty percent was retained locally for office administration and construction based on actual needs, while twenty percent was remitted to the Municipal Baojia Committee for city-wide facilities. The expenditure of these funds must be approved by the district sub-committees of the Municipal Committee. The Chief, the General Lianbao Chief, and the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of the police sub-bureaus are jointly responsible for the safekeeping and payment of expenses. The funds are deposited in designated banks, and withdrawals require the seals of at least three of the aforementioned four individuals. The Baojia Committee's twenty percent of the funds are budgeted and then distributed after approval by the Chairman.</p>
<p>The Baojia fees are collected monthly from citizens based on the amount approved by the municipal government, and a special Baojia certificate of the same value is issued, affixed to the certificate, and stamped by the Baojia Chief as proof. It also serves as a document for household registration changes and for collecting rations. This system has been strictly implemented, and no malpractices such as embezzlement or excessive charges have been discovered. Both the police sub-bureaus and the Baojia are able to know the movement of residents in and out of the jurisdiction, as the household registration within the jurisdiction is jointly managed by the police and the Baojia.</p>
<p>The Municipal Baojia Committee is chaired by Secretary-General Luo, with the Chief of each district committee and the General Lianbao Chief as ex-officio members, and the Chief of the relevant department of the Police Bureau as an ex-officio standing member, joined by local gentry and prominent figures.</p>
<p>All district sub-committees of the Municipal Baojia Committee have now been established, with a fixed number of twenty-one members. The Lianbao Chiefs, the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of the police sub-bureaus are ex-officio members, joined by local prominent figures and gentry, with the most respected among them serving as the Chief of the committee.</p>
<p>The most important work from July of last year to June of this year is described below:</p>
<p>Reissuance of Residence Permits — Citizen certificates or residence permits issued in the past by the old eighteen districts, the South Shanghai West District encroaching on roads, the old Nanshi District, and the old Zhabei District, etc., were inconsistent in style and content due to different jurisdictions. Following the current regulations of the Ministry of the Interior, they were unified and reissued, and thorough efforts were made to eliminate potential abuses. Reissuance procedures were established. Although some unscrupulous individuals violated the regulations and engaged in fraud during implementation, they were severely punished to achieve the goal of benefiting the people. However, the organization of the police bureau is based on the responsibility of the sub-bureau chiefs, and the respective sub-bureaus inevitably still have the drawbacks of adhering to established practices. Generally speaking, most of the past customs have been eliminated.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Headquarters of the Self-Defense Corps — Since the establishment of the self-defense system, theft, terrorism, and other crimes have been significantly reduced. However, each district acted independently, and due to the lack of unified methods, residents experienced different conditions even across a single street, which greatly diminished the effectiveness of self-defense. To remedy this shortcoming and strengthen its effectiveness, a headquarters was established to unify the steps. Bureau Chief Zhou concurrently serves as the Corps Commander, the Deputy Bureau Chief serves as the Deputy Corps Commander, and the Baojia Office Director serves as the Secretary-General. The Chief of the relevant department also assumed duties. Under the strong guidance of the headquarters, self-defense brigades were uniformly established in each district, with the General Lianbao Chief concurrently serving as the Brigade Commander and the sub-bureau chiefs serving as supervisors, to achieve close cooperation between the police and the Baojia. Knowledgeable young people from each district were rigorously trained to form model teams as self-defense cadres.</p>
<p>Assisting in Air Defense and Garrison Work — With the current situation becoming increasingly tense, air defense and garrison work are of paramount importance. The equipment of air defense and garrison materials urgently needs to be strengthened, which cannot be done by the government alone. The Shanghai Municipal Citizen Air Defense Headquarters specially established an air defense training center. Each Baojia district within the jurisdiction sends trainees on a regular basis to receive training. As of the end of June of this year, five classes have graduated, totaling approximately seven hundred people, who are now serving as air defense instructors in various districts. Currently, the fundraising for air defense and garrison equipment is being actively carried out with the approval and instructions of the municipal government. The total amount of donations raised is over 200,100,000 yuan, which is distributed by each district according to the approved budget to purchase air defense and garrison equipment, resulting in a significant improvement.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Propaganda Committee — To enable citizens to understand their obligations to the country and the significance of Baojia work, and to facilitate the promotion of organization and training, important personnel from various news agencies, newspapers, and the Municipal Propaganda Office were invited to serve as Baojia propaganda commissioners, bearing the work by district. Chen Binhe, the president of Shen Bao, serves as the chairman, responsible for planning, to promote a deeper understanding among citizens and to foster a fusion of opinions between the government and the people. The Self-Defense Weekly is also published to convey the activities of various Baojia districts and the laws and instructions of the government.</p>
<p>Holding the Spring Military Review of the Self-Defense Corps — To promote the spirit of self-defense and self-preservation, to enhance their interest in service, to expand their awareness of the country and society, and to review past achievements, a spring military review was held on April 15, 1945, at the Racecourse. More than 6,500 members from various districts participated. The review was highly praised by all parties.</p>
<p>Holding Training Classes for Baojia Secretaries and Above by District — In view of the fact that the full-time Baojia staff at and above the level of Baojia secretary in the past were responsible for a great deal of work, but lacked a deep understanding of laws and regulations, and that inappropriate behavior was sometimes discovered, strict screening and unified training were carried out. The districts that have already held this training include Penglai, Xieqiao, Yi Miao, Huashan, and Changning. After returning to work in their respective districts after training, there has been significant progress. All districts will implement training separately in the future.</p>
<p>Preparing to Hold a Centralized Training Camp for Baojia Self-Defense Cadre Personnel — To strengthen the self-defense organization and unify training, it is stipulated that personnel above the level of squad leader of the self-defense brigade in each district must receive centralized training. Preparations have been completed, and school will begin on July 1.</p>
<p>Unifying the Armbands and Identification Cards of Baojia Personnel — In the past, the armbands and identification cards of Baojia personnel in various districts were of various colors, leading to many malpractices. This office has now printed unified armbands and identification cards for distribution and use.</p>
<p>Taking Over the Issuance of Travel Documents for Foreigners — The issuance of residence permits and naturalization matters for foreigners in this city were originally handled by this office, while travel documents for foreigners were handled by the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Shanghai. In May of this year, it was ordered to be taken over by the Police Bureau, and the transfer has been completed, and the processing has been resumed.</p>
<p>Matters Concerning the Reduction and Exemption of Military Service for the Self-Defense Corps — The Ministry of the Interior and other parties advocate strict implementation of military service for the Self-Defense Corps. After the establishment of regulations, they were approved and promulgated by the municipal government for strict enforcement, so as to cultivate the concept that it is honorable and natural for citizens to fulfill their obligations to the country and seek cooperation with the government. However, the success of this matter still depends on the cooperation of government agencies and institutions at all levels.</p>
<p>In fact, Baojia work involves numerous tasks. After two years of active promotion, although social trust has been increasing day by day, it is still far from the ideal state. However, for a seven-year-old disease, one must seek a three-year-old cure. I can only uphold the guidance of my superiors, with a sincere and pure heart, striving to use my intelligence and courageously move forward.</p>
<h3>My Opinion on the Municipal Government's Change of Office Hours</h3>
<p>— Hanya (Crow)</p>
<p>The reason for changing office hours in the summer is to avoid the heat, so that the spirit of the staff is at ease, so as not to reduce work efficiency. The hottest time in summer is of course in the afternoon, when everyone feels tired and lazy. If you want to work, the effect of the work must be reduced a lot. Therefore, the financial industry changes to half-day work during the summer, and the municipal government, starting from the 16th of this month, the office hours in the morning are still the same, and the afternoon is changed from 3:30 to 6:00. This not only reduces the efficiency of the work, but also causes great losses to the staff in terms of spirit and time.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most of the staff either eat in the municipal government canteen, or bring their own meals, because it is too far from home, time is tight, and going back and forth at noon is too hot. If the time is changed, there will be three and a half hours of free time in the middle. But there is no public transport to go home for dinner. Walking back and forth twice when the sun is shining brightly will make you exhausted when you get to the office, and the efficiency of the work will naturally be weakened invisibly. If you still eat in the municipal government, then these three hours of time in the afternoon are all free. Either chatting and making noise, or dozing off and resting, wasting this long half day. After a few hours of dozing or chatting, it is a very difficult thing to regain your energy and return to work. But, if you don't chat and doze off, how can you use these three hours? What kind of pastime is beneficial to your body and mind? There is no way to do anything but waste time. If the entire municipal government has 10,000 people, and each person has three hours, then 30,000 hours will be wasted every day, which does not seem to be very consistent with the principle of thrift during the time of national crisis.</p>
<p>If the staff all go home for dinner, then they will get up at 6:00 in the morning, wash up, and walk or take a car to the office. The time will not be too much. In addition to walking for dinner at noon, there will be no more than an hour and a half of rest. If you work until 6:00 in the afternoon, you will not get home until 6:30 at the earliest, and you will have to hurry to take a bath, etc. By the time you go to bed, there will be no free time. Every staff member, from morning to night, besides working like a machine, has no chance to read newspapers and books and cultivate their body and mind. The staff will also feel more pain in their spirits than before.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the sound of electricity restriction and thrift, originally all washing, bathing, dinner and other things can be completed before dusk, and then you can grope in the dark. Civil servants who can only get home at nearly 7:00 in the evening, and then hurry to take a bath, etc., will inevitably have to complete it under the lights. In the dimly lit office, or in the corridor, the lighting time will be extended by at least half an hour before and after office hours. Both the public and private parties will suffer materially.</p>
<p>Regarding work, for example, for the investigation of commercial firms or tax payment work, most of the commercial firms are preparing to stop business before 5:00, so there is almost no way to work after 4:30.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suggest that the two and a half hours from 3:30 to 6:00 in the afternoon should be added to the morning as much as possible, such as starting an hour earlier and extending the lunch break by an hour and a half, from 8:00 in the morning to 1:30 in the afternoon, working for five and a half hours as well. Not only can the work be consistent, but also a lot of manpower and material resources can be saved, and the spirit of the staff can be at ease. I hope the authorities can study and adopt this and make revisions based on it.</p>
<h3>The Urgent Need to Repair the Shanghai-Minhang Highway</h3>
<p>— Diming</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Minhang Highway is a section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway from Shanghai to Minhang. This road connects to the southern section of the national highway at the Minhang ferry across the Huangpu River, and reaches Hangzhou via Nanqiao, Jinshanwei, and Zhapu. At Beiqiao, there is a branch line to Songjiang, which is connected to the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Therefore, this section of the highway is actually one of the important land transportation arteries from Shanghai to the south.</p>
<p>This road was built in 1922. Before the war, it was managed by the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau. Due to proper management, the road surface was flat and wide, and the roadbed was solid and stable, making it one of the excellent highways in the country. After the outbreak of the war, the Highway Bureau withdrew to the west, and this road entered a state of anarchy. It has been eight years since there was destruction but no repairs, and we can imagine the dilapidated condition of this road.</p>
<p>The author went to Minhang from Shanghai this time due to business, departing by a China Central Railway long-distance bus. Initially, the road surface was still good, but after leaving Caohejing, the road surface was badly damaged. Not only were there ups and downs, but also countless holes, about one meter in diameter and nearly half the depth of a small air raid shelter in Shanghai, connected and arranged in the middle of the road, so that the car was constantly bumping on it. This situation was particularly severe in the long section from Wujia Lane to Beiqiao. There were also several deep pools with water accumulated from the previous days of rain, making it difficult for the car to find its way. As a result, the car's speed was slow, and there were frequent breakdowns. The journey that could originally be completed in one hour now takes three or four hours to reach. Not only that, according to the author's observation, if this road encounters old or heavy vehicles, the danger of overturning may be unavoidable, which is a matter of great consideration and worry.</p>
<p>At present, the evacuation of the population is becoming more active. However, talking about evacuation must first ensure smooth transportation. The Shanghai-Minhang Highway connects to the counties of Fengxian, Jinshan, and Songjiang in southern Pudong via Minhang in the south. From these counties, you can transfer to Pinghu, Haiyan, Zhapu and other places. In the west, it connects to Songjiang via Beiqiao and can reach Fengjing, Jiashan, and Jiaxing, etc. Therefore, it is a very important link in the evacuation transportation line. Furthermore, from the perspective of material transportation, most of the daily necessities and industrial products of the above-mentioned places rely on Shanghai to be imported through this highway, and the local food and local products of various places are also transported to Shanghai through this highway. Therefore, this road is also the economic artery of Shanghai and its neighboring counties. Therefore, regardless of whether it is from the perspective of evacuating the population or transporting materials, this road should not be allowed to remain in its current state of disrepair, but should be repaired immediately to facilitate the evacuation of the population and the transportation of materials.</p>
<p>I recently heard that the Su-Hu Highway, which connects Jiangsu Province and Shanghai, has broken through various difficulties and started repairs as a result of discussions between the local authorities. This road is entirely within the jurisdiction of this city, so the difficulties should be less than those of the Su-Hu Highway, and the construction should also be more convenient. I hope that the road administration and evacuation authorities of this city will pay attention to it.</p>
