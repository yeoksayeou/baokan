<h3>美對我國殷切期望　消弭紛爭完成統一　奠世界和平繁榮基礎</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕杜魯門總統於馬歇爾大使啓程卦華前兩小時，發表詳盡聲明，闡述美國對華政策，總統力陳美國將繼續承認國民政府爲唯一合法之中國政府，並希望國共糾紛能即獲得解決，復促速即召開各黨各派代表會議，以研究解決紛爭之具體辦法。又據負責方面息，總統之聲明，暗示美國準備以二十萬萬元之鉅款貸與中國，其條件之優越，決不亞於美英之信用放款。此外，美國復擬以數千技術人員，協助中國從事復興之工作，料馬歇爾大使赴渝時，必挑有較總統聲明更具體之計劃。</p>
<h3>杜魯門聲明　美對華政策</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十六日電〕華盛頓十五日合衆電，美總統杜魯門，本日發表美對華政策聲明，全文如次：美國政府認爲，處此嶄新與未開拓之時代，世界和平之繁榮，繫於主權國家，同在聯合國組織中，謀集體安全之能力，美政府之堅定信心，爲一強大統一民主之中國，對於聯合國組織之成功及世界和平，乃最爲急要之事，由於外來侵略，一如過去日之所爲，或因強烈內爭所讓成之紊亂與裂之中國，將爲今日與未來世界安定及和平之破壞潛力。美政府久已謹守之原則，即國內事件之處理，乃各主權國家人民之責任。本世紀來之各項事件，顯示世界任何一隅之和平遭受破壞，即足以威脅整個世界之和平，因之，爲美國暨所有聯合國之主要利益計，中國人民不可忽視以和平商談方式，即時調協國內歧見之機會。美政府深信最爲主要者，厥有（一）中國國民政府及中國共產黨之軍隊，以及其他持有歧見之武裝部隊，應設法停止軍事衝突，俾達中國全國完全重歸中國有效統治之目的，其中包括日軍之立即撤退。（二）各主要政治份子代表，共同參加之全國性會議，應謀目前國內紛爭之早日解次辦法，亦即促我中國統一之解次辦法。</p>
<h3>協助我政府解除日軍武裝　主張各黨舉行協商會議　統一軍令裁除自立之軍隊</h3>
<p>美國及其他聯合國，曾承認現在之中國國民政府爲中國境內之唯一合法政府，中國國民政府爲達成統一的中國之目的之適當機構，美國及英聯合王國，依據一九四三年之開羅宣言，蘇聯依據其所參加本年七月之波茨坦宣言與本年八月之中蘇條約與協定，均有政力中國解放之約定，其中包括將東北歸還中國統治，上述諸協定供係與中國國民政府所締訂者。美國爲與中國國民政府繼續其過去爲遂行戰爭而建立之經常密切合作，並依據波茨坦宣言及淸除日本勢力留存中國之可能起見，特於解除日軍武裝，並使其撇離中國之工作中，担負一確定之義務，因之，美國曾協助國民政府，解除收復區內日軍之武裝，並使其撤退，且將繼續，如此，美海軍陸戰隊刻在華北即係爲此。美國目前及將來均承認中國國民政府，且在國際事項方面，尤其在淸除中國境內日本勢力方面，與中國國民政府合作。美國深信，欲達到此目的，必須速謀軍事衝突之停止，美國之支持將不致擴展爲左右中國任何內戰之美國軍事干涉。美國業已被迫以巨大代價，恢復首由日本侵略東北而破壞之和平，除非日本在中國之勢力澈底淸除，又除非中國成爲統一民主昇平之國家，則太平洋之和平非化爲泡影，亦可能遭受破壞，此即美海陸軍暫時留於中國之目的也，美國固知，今日之中國國民政府，爲「一黨政府」，並相信此政府之基礎如能擴大，而包含國內之其他政治份子，則必能促進中國之和平統一與民主改革，因之，美國極力主張國內各主要政治份子代表所舉行之全國性會議，商得辦法，使各該政治份子在中國國民政府中，能獲公平而有效之參加，欲如此，美政府認爲中國國父孫中山先生爲國家民主過程中之臨時措施而定之「一黨訓政」似須修改。自立之軍隊之存在，如共產黨軍隊之存在，實與中國政治團結背道而馳，而實際上使中國政治團結不能實現。廣泛代議制之政府建立之際，自立之軍隊，即應裁除，而中國境內所有武裝部隊，應有效歸編於中國國軍。美政府本其過去一再宣示，關於自決之立塲，認爲造成政治團結之詳細步驟，應由中國人民自行釐訂，任何外國政府干預此事，均屬不當。美政府深感中國對於其他聯合國負有一明顯之責任，即須停止其領土以內之武裝衝突，因其足以威脅世界之安定與和平也。此一責任，國民政府與中國各政治及軍人集團，均須分担</p>
<h3>馬歇爾可能先來滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕關於美駐華大使馬歇爾元帥來中國，究先到何地之推測，傳說不一。記者曾先後向美方有關當局探訪，據稱：時至現在，尙未得到確實官方消息。預計馬氏可能在本月二十日抵華，據各方拍來電報稱，預計彼可於二十日抵重慶，但美方諸將領，則多集中上海，屆時馬氏先來滬一行，似極有可能。美國生活雜誌已派定攝影記者拉克斯，在此採訪馬歇爾抵華時之新聞。</p>
<h3>美已準備　對我貸欵</h3>
<p>中國按照上列所述途徑，向和平團結之道邁進之際，美國準備以一切合理方式，協助國民政府，從事建國，改善其農工業經濟，並建立其軍事體制，俾能克盡中國對本國及對國際所負維護和平秩序之責任。美國爲增進上述援助，將準備對中國要求於合理條款下，獲得信用貸款及現金貸款，以助中國全國健全經濟體制之發展及中美貿易健全往來之計劃一事，予以對華有利之考慮。</p>
<h3>國府命令</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十六日電〕國府十六日電：（一）行政院呈請將故員張大飛·龍震澤，追贈爲空軍上尉，應照准，此令。（二）試用衛生署技正祝紹煌另有任用，祝紹煌應予免職，此令。</p>
<h3>蔣主席在太和殿　對北平大中學學生訓詞</h3>
<p>革命之靑年子弟，在敵偽荼毒壓迫之下，爲三民主義與民族的人格，堅苦奮鬥，百折不回。今茲抗戰勝利，余得與我革侖子弟相見於北平，此不僅余平生最大之安慰，亦且爲中國歷史上最可紀念之大事。（鼓掌）然此八年之中，已有無數靑年，爲敵偽殘殺，虐待以死，余茲來平，已不克相見，感念何能自已；尙望我後死之子弟，負起責任，知恥奮發，努力自強，實現三民主義，以完成其未竟之志事。（鼓掌）今當建國開始之際，我靑年子弟，要勉爲總理之信徒，國家之主人，必依照余下列之提示，身體力行，始克達到目的。</p>
<p>發揮民族精神　恢復民族倫理</p>
<p>第一，要發揮民族精神，恢復民族倫理。我中華民國，爲禮義之邦，我民族爲重視倫理之民族。其立國之精神，在於忠孝二字，凡我黃帝子孫，皆當忠於國家，忠於主義；孝於民族，孝於父母。此次我國之抗戰，賴我全國同胞，發揮忠孝之精神，殺身成仁，捨生取義，用能轉敗爲勝，轉危爲安。今後猶望我靑年子弟，將此種精神，發揚光大，服從侖令，嚴守紀律，在政府領導之下，建設我中國成爲自由獨立之國家。（鼓掌）</p>
<p>讀中國之命運　完成五種建設</p>
<p>「中國之侖運」，完成五種建設。余於「中國之命運」一書中，曾說明中國之建設，必須以倫理，心理，政治，經濟，社會五種建設，爲其基礎。而此五種建設，即要我革命之子弟爲其基幹。余今日即將此建國之責任，交付於吾革命之子弟，望我子弟自重自愛自立自強，以擔負此重大之責任。（鼓掌）</p>
<p>打破自私觀察　養成親愛精神</p>
<p>第三，要打破自私自利之觀念，養成親愛團結之精神。吾中華民族，過去之缺點，即在個人懷自私自利之心，而缺乏國家民族之觀念，故形同一盤散沙，招致敵人之侵略。今後要完成建國大業，則我全國同胞，必須集中于三民主義旗幟之下，相親相愛，團結一致，互助合作，奮鬥到底，乃克達成吾人之目的。最後，望我靑年子弟，明瞭強國必先強種之義，鍛練體格，注重健康，以期不愧爲頂天立地之黃帝子孫，然後始能担當一切困苦艱難之工作。至于汝等生活上之痛苦，與學校之困難，余時刻關心，已囑北平市敎育當局，盡其職責，力求改善，務望我靑年子弟專心向學，努力上進，以期不愧爲健全的革命幹部，完成你們實行主義建設國家之使命。</p>
<h3>主席將出巡南京　太和殿召集北平學生訓話　兩萬靑年戴熱情大奔放</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕關係方面稱：將主席次一出巡地點，可能爲南京，約十七·十八日可成行。又委座行轅公吿，接受人民陳訴後，述日市民向郵局指定本箱投書，極爲踴躍，有遠自天津乘車前來投書者。截至十五日下午九時止，前門外郵箱，已積滿四大箱，西四牌樓郵局二大箱，其他三處各一箱，估計共約函件萬封。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕故宮太和殿上，今天有一塲愉快的紛擾，蔣主席被兩萬多的男女靑年，熱烈的包圍起來了。時間是上午十時三十分，蔣主席講完了話，便在一片如雷的歡呼鼓掌聲裏，步下太和殿，他剛和靄的和兩位掌校旗的小妹妹握手，兩萬多的靑年學生，立刻像鐵粉遇到磁石樣，聚攏上來。周圍的侍衛，趕忙把主席擁回殿上，但是他好像喜歡那些男女孩子，馬上又轉下殿去，慰問西邊的孩子們。這一次孩子們眞像潮水破堤似的，擁了上來，只有幾紗鐘的功夫，已把主席團團圍住。幾個比較英勇的，逕直趨前與主席握手。主席滿面春風，一點沒有拒絕。這時，塲上的空氣，混亂而愉快。蔣主席萬歲的呼聲，此停彼起。各色各樣的帽子，擲滿了空中。侍衛們好容易從水洩不通羣衆中，闢出條路，把主席扶上大殿。不料沒有滿足的羣衆，又跟了來，偌大的太和殿變成一片黑鴉鴉的人海，連石獅十和銅鶴的背上，都飾上人了。這愉快的紛擾，一直繼續了一刻鐘之久。主席才由孫長官迎仲，戴笠將軍，護衛出了會塲。但是孫長官的脚，已被熱情的孩子們蹴跛。戴將軍的帽　下，已掛上了許多汗珠了。會場上，孩子們者喜樂顏開的散去了。雖然今天他們許多是鄭掉了帽子，或被人踏失了鞋子的，那些和主席握過手的，更受到同學們無上的艷羨。今天主席訓詞歷十五分鐘。主席今天戎裝，御黃綠呢質斗篷，容光煥發。在靑年羣衆的紛亂包圍中，始終和靄的微笑着。除了軍帽下的一片鬍子外一點也顯不出老來。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十六日電〕蔣主席十六日上午十時，在太和殿召集本市大中學校學生訓話，到全市学生一萬八千餘人。主席於九時五十分抵達太和殿，着戎裝，徐步登壇，全體學生歡呼鼓掌，達五分鐘不絕。主席頻頻揮手作答，並致訓詞。詞畢，復下城檢閱，全體學生，歡欣若狂。並有若干學生自行列中湧出，若欲將八年來精神上之抑　痛苦，傾訴於主席者。主席慈祥愷悌，並與隨近之學生握手，以示慰問之意。（主席演詞原文見右下角）</p>
<h3>主席夫婦檢閱美軍　授勳官兵二十餘人</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平十六日電〕蔣主席夫婦今日初次露面，在北平使館區附近，檢閱美國海外部隊第五團行列，並向官兵二十餘人給獎。儀式進行順利。主席夫婦驅車往閱兵場時，民衆數千人，咸以一瞻豐采爲快。主席露立於蒙古草原吹來之強勁北風中，風過之靡沙塵滿天，一度吹去某美兵之頭盔。蔣夫人暨紅十字會護士三人，均避於華北美軍司令洛基少將之汽車中。洛基暨其參謀長宛頓，北平方面美軍司令官瓊斯，暨其屬下官兵多人，均由主席授予景星掌以酬其援助投降日軍遺散回國之功。另有四人，則褒揚彼等在冲繩及帛琉島之戰績。海外部隊全副戎裝，携帶戰車驅逐車，榴彈砲及平射砲，行經主席面前。美國軍警五十名，並中國軍警多人，担任主席護衛。天空則有「海賊」式戰鬥機三十六架，分十二排，飛經塲上，檢閱畢後，主席出席洛基少將之招待會，並在美軍廣播電台，發表簡短演說。主席今晚邀請美軍官兵觀看平劇。</p>

<h3>昆明聯大雲大　復課尚待勸導</h3>
<p>〔中央社昆明十六日電〕本市學潮，自敎次朱經農抵昆處理後，情形本已好轉，聯大，雲大，敎授均通過於十七日復課，並迭次勸導學生復課，盧主席亦曾兩次召集學生代表，曉諭備至，惟學生罷課委員會近似爲二十人餘所把持，屢屢變更其要求，例如關於死亡學生安葬問題，原經敎職員與學生代表決定安葬於校內墓地，並已包工後，罷課委員會又要求改葬黑龍潭，並反對決定安葬日期。又罷課委員會在外宣傳，甚至有煽動人民「不納稅」之口號，故十七日復課尚有問題，但各校當局及敎授，正在極力勸導中。</p>

<h3>侵華禍首如此下場　近衛昨服毒自殺　殆欲避免暴露秘密致牽累日皇</h3>
<p>〔本報東京十六日急電〕近衛文　星期六在荻窄杉波道上之私邸已服毒殺畢命，消息傳出後，已給予日本人民以極深刻印象。近　爲發動侵華戰爭之第一號禍首，渠自獲悉麥師總部宣布其為戰犯後，心緒殊劣。據其屋內十五齡僮僕吿本報記者稱：近衛聞渠被列入戰犯名單及山下奉文被判處絞刑後，曾於紙土畫絞刑台數種，對絞刑痛苦，至感恐懼。迨十五日晚，遂以服毒自殺聞。當記者於今晚五時半馳至近衛私邸時，門前已有美軍憲兵守護，聯合國記者約三十人，均擁擠於近衛臥室門外，近衛夫人千代子及其子在塲痛哭。據吿：渠昨晚尙與其夫商談入獄後家庭問題如何安處，至午夜二時始寢。伊謂當時其夫狀態如常，並無異樣，俟至今晨五時，始發現其已於書室中服毒自殺，面朝內園。其子亦插言稱：當渠發現其父自殺後，即召醫生急救，但時機已遲，延至今晨九時一刻氣絕。近衛屍體刻正由美憲兵守護。記者巡視其屋時，見其室內四週遍懸字書屏條，均係各大漢奸之手跡，如汪精衛及陳公隊等之字畫均有。</p>
<p>〔路透社東京十六日電〕麥帥總部今日宣布：近衛文　業於星期六夜服毒自殺。近衛年五十四歲，出生貴族家庭，曾三次任日本首相，死時猶任無任所大臣及戰爭淸算委員會委員。死者於珍珠港事件發生前不久，猶任首相之職，對華戰事之發動，近衛實爲元兇之一。據幣原首相吿本社特派員稱：「近衛之死，殊出人意料之外，余信死者意頗誠懇，惜其政策領導錯誤，故最近頗爲國內人民所非難。」近衛之妻吿本社訪員，謂其夫於死前最後一夕，曾晤其親戚及摯友，其弟近衛子爵甫自美國歸來，是夕亦曾晤其兄，賓客吿辭後，其二十二齡之子曾與其父談良久，是爲最後晤近衛之一人。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十六日電〕據日本消息靈通方面今日午後宣布：近衛自殺之原因，係在衛護日　裕仁，蓋近衛為受戰罪審判，必將被迫透露珍珠港前日內部之秘密，致牽累日皇，並暴露其於此次事件中所負之責任。近衛此次不經剖腹而服毒自殺，乃依照日貴族之傳統，據悉，日貴族如在其住處流血，將累日皇招致不祥。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十六日電〕昨日營茂大監獄門首，人頭擠擠，均欲一看各戰爭犯投案情狀，近衛自殺新聞傳來，均極度震驚。美官方聞近衛自殺後，立即宣佈渠有權自裁。通近衛自殺室之小道，有高大美兵三人，依日本習慣赤足守衛，日本各攝影院准其攝影，美國官方攝影師早已攝畢。</p>
<h3>絕命書一通　禍國政策深自內疚</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十六日電〕近衛自殺前，曾用鉛筆自撰絕侖書，於今晨一時許在其臥室面授其次子，然後於二時左右就寢，約三小時後服毒自殺。其遺書稱：「中國事變發生以來，予對國事處置失當，時常內咎於心。惟予若即被美國法庭拘捕而受審判，此種羞辱實使予難以忍受。中國事變結果如此，予深覺應負特別責任，職此之放，于曾盡最大努力，擬使美日兩國獲得諒解，以期解決中國問題。予曾希望並會試與美國合作，俾由和平路徑解決太平洋問題，不意反被列爲戰犯，誠屬遺憾。予之眞意即在現在想，已獲得友人之了解，此種友人在美國方面亦不在少數。此界輿論，現方充滿因戰事而產生之過分刺激，未免感情用事，對無辜者不免有所誤會，且時常惡意中傷，並製造無稽謠言，但此種興奮情緒至相當時期自趨於平靜，屆時是非目有公論」。</p>
<h3>近衛自殺後　季楠特發表聲明　審判戰犯當依據美國法律　苟屬無辜無須懷恐心理　日皇股肱木戶投獄</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十六日電〕日前首相近衛文　畏罪自殺復，日本戰犯審訊案美國官席檢察官李楠今日特向日本民衆發表聲明稱：日本人苟屬無辜，無需恐懼美國審判。近衛奉令向菅茂監獄目投，後竟服毒自殺，其實凡涉有戰犯嫌疑而被拘禁之人，除其本人確知有罪而目受良心上之譴責外，儘可放心。吾人屢經昭示，判定任何人罪狀，必須經過法律手續。美國爲先進文明國，其司法制度素稱完善公允，凡畏罪自殺者必係在心理上未臻健全，否則彼必對美國司法認識不足，或估計錯誤。　〔聯合社京京十六日電〕日皇裕仁依爲股肱之「日內閣製造者」木戶幸一，今日偕秘書一人及聯絡處代表一人，向營茂監獄投案，所帶行李爲手提箱一及包裏二，木戶對近衛自殺不加評論。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十六日專電〕權成方面訊：麥帥不久或可對日戰犯問題重加檢討，其目的可能在於目前暫時停止逮捕日政治經濟界之高級職位日人。自兩週前麥帥下令述捕戰犯以來，日政治經濟幾呈完全停滯狀態，今日下午麥帥又下令逮捕在戰爭期間曾服務戰俘營而違反國際法規之日人六十九名。日本雖無盟國軍政府之組織，但現時之情勢，已使麥帥總部實際變爲盟方在日之政府矣。僉信戰犯逮捕之暫時停止，將予日本一喘息機會，俾日政府與其政治發展得以恢復也。</p>
<h3>麥帥令日廢除　國家宗敎制度</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京十六日電〕麥帥昨下令廢止前由軍閥強迫人民接受之國家宗敎制度。</p>

<h3>聯合國永久會址　決設美國　大會權限亦確定</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕聯合國籌備委員會昨以三分之二之大多數票，通過聯合圖機構會址設在美國。又關於全國大會及安全理事會之權限問題，於星期五之辯論中，曾引起激烈之爭論，昨始經第八技術小組委員會決定。爭執之點，乃爲全體大會是否有權討論籌委會關於安全理事會方法。程序·議程等之建議，或籌委會之此等建議，是否應直接交由安全理事會自行決定。第八技術小組委員會昨以二，　票對五票（六票棄權），議決　單加拿大之建　，決定修正原案關於首次全體大會初步臨時議程之條文</p>
<p>經社理事會　明春可成立</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十五日電〕聯合團組織籌委會鑒於予戰後經濟社會及有關問題，有及早處理之絕對迫切性，頃已決定經濟及社會理事會，於明年一月或二月間成立。籌委會丙種技術小組委員會現已完成其關於經濟社會理事會組織機構之工作，按經濟社會理事會將於大會於一月間選舉理事會十八理事後，十五日以內舉行其第一次常會。出席丙種技術小糾委會之印度首席代表，本日已擬竣其提議草案（包括經濟社會理事會所屬各主要委員會之組織計劃），該案將提交大會批准，據丙種技術小組委會所擬之計劃，經濟社會理事會將於其第一次常會中，設立五個主要委員會，以檢討世界當前面臨各迫切社會經濟問題之一切細節。經濟社會理事會第一次常會所將設立之五個主要委員會，將爲（一）人權委員會，（二）經濟及就業委員會，（三）臨時社會委員會，（四）統計委員會，（五）麻醉藥品委員會，此外並通過於理事會第二次常會設立其他三個委員會之建議，惟此需視第一次常會情况而決定。此三委員會爲（一）社會統計委員會，（二）臨時運輸及交通委員會，（三）會計委員會。各委員會將由政府代表及技術專家協同組織。</p>

<h3>美軍事評論家伊里奧特　論日本當前新危機　謂日本當局旣未悔禍亦未實行民主</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據舊金山十五日廣播構：美國著名軍事評論家伊里奧特少校今日在紐約時報著文，暢論日本當前之危機，及日本政府延遲，實施民主之不當。</p>
<p>伊甩奧特首謂：當日本社會問題未解決前，議會惟延宕時間而已。日本但對目前社會及經濟之危機，却全予漠視。</p>
<p>目前日本基本事務甚多，例如食糧·敎育·勞資關係·民主問題·地私有權·財政困難·及期求一公正人道政時之產生等，皆亟特着手處理解決，但議會祗尙空談，並無實議。</p>
<p>此項情勢，正爲日本在危機中典型之反應。最近日內閣組織澈查戰敗原因委員會時，未嘗提及日本所以作戰之原因，其引起戰禍負責人之罪行，及戰爭時一般軍閥所散佈不可恕之謊言，唯斤於日本爲何戰敗一點，實不可解。</p>
<p>此種態度之眞意義，實在研求如何強化此國家，以備再作一次戰爭耳。</p>
<p>伊氏次謂：日本內閣對日軍有辱國體之罪行，迄今未嘗表示悔禍之意。八年前，南京日軍之姦殺行爲，即日人自憶，亦感義慚可怖。於八年後之今日，日本常局對此項不人道之姦殺　。仍未付公道審判。</p>
<p>日本若干領袖雖狡猾自承其有民主思想，但軍權主義與全體主義，顯然尙未在日本死亡。一般軍閥，武士道與商人，發動戰爭後。現仍昂首闊步自以爲榮。例如南大將最近即曾向讀賣新聞記者否認軍閥或財閥爲此次戰爭之眞罪犯。日本之所以崩潰，應歸咎於一般民衆。</p>
<p>渠謂『東條已竭其所能，唯民衆不能盡如其期望耳』。</p>
<p>此種論調，所謂民衆不能滿足天皇要求，日本之高官，實已屢次聲言，殊屬可哂。</p>
<p>但美軍佔領日本後，確已堅決將妨害和平與正義之因素芟除。日本社會政治及經濟生活中軍閥及超國家主義者的勢力，亦經摧毀。一時聲勢顯赫之日本軍閥已入獄等待戰犯罪之審判，有者並已經法律之審判。日本之實業農業，及國民生活，已完全淸除封建餘跡。一般戰前熟悉日本者，目前再來日本，必將發覺此國家已經驚人之改變。然所有此種變動，均係外力壓迫所造成，絕非由日方單獨實施許多被日當局在理論上接受之贊動，均由日本反動份子加以反抗。總之，反對改革之日人，不可勝數，但彼等竟猶以民主份子自居。</p>
<p>採取積極行動，此其時矣。眞正民主之新憲法，應由日人決定之。現應宣佈一個確定的，實際而明白之計劃，以便應付日本目前之社會危機，誠然，所有日本政治家，甚至包括日　本身，必須立即停止一切空虛之諾言及毫無實際之保證，而必須確定充實之建議。</p>
<p>如此，日本方能沿進步之路前進，如此，世人方信日人美麗詞句確極有力，如此，日人方能使世界信服日本確有資格成爲現代文明國家之一員。</p>
<p>伊氏末謂：我人決不能認爲佔領當局可負責實施永久性的改革。因誤聽惡劣領袖之言而失敗的日本，應即順從眞正愛國份子之至理名言。然日本所需要者決不止此，日本更需要一種立即的改革計劃。</p>
<h3>英人對猶太共產主義抗議　列寗半身像受損</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕星期畫報今日載稱：該報於星期日侵晨接得神秘電話，謂「吾人為表示對猶太共產主義抗議，且因信任英國與英帝國起見，頃已搗毀並爾福特方塲畔之列寗紀念物。該報未及詢問，電話已斷。乃派記者赴該地，見第一次世界大戰前，列寗在倫教時所居屋內之列寗半身像，鼻耳兩限均已大受損壞，當夜即有警察一名，守獲該像。</p>

<h3>駐印緬美軍　陸續啟返國</h3>
<p>〔中央社新德里十六日專電〕駐印緬區美軍總部今日下午宣稱：本年九月以來，自印啟程返美之美軍總數，爲十三萬三千六百八十人，其中七萬二千人來自印緬戰區，又總数中三萬七千餘係來自中國，至印搭輪返美。但十一月底以後，中國戰區美軍來此搭輪者甚少。照目前撤退速率計算，預計明年二月一日以前，將僅有三萬三千五百美軍滯留印緬戰區。官方前曾聲明，明年一月七日起，喀拉蚩已不很爲美軍登輪口岸，此後撤退返美之美軍，將在加爾各答乘輪，途經太平洋直駛西雅圖。行駛此路航綫之第一艘輪船，業於十一月五日離加爾各答，而自喀拉蚩駛出者則在十二月五日。</p>

<h3>盟國曾用無人駕駛之飛機　那幾滅德潛艇堅固陣地　機內滿藏炸藥可直衝而下</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據舊金山十五日廣播稱：盟國會使用秘密武器，摧毀德國潛艇活動。據稱當時德國潛艇藏匿處所，係四十英尺厚之水泥鋼骨所製成，任何炸彈，均不足以摧毀之。盟方於是乃使用新法明之無人駕駛飛機，滿載炸藥炸彈，以無綫電，電達及電視共同控制，使共直達目的地，直衝而下，毀滅德潛艇堅固陣地。</p>

<h3>中國當前急務　建立現代交通系統</h3>
<p>— Brig．Gen．George　Olmstead原著</p>
<p>喬治·奧爾姆史丹特將軍Brig．Gen．George　Olmstead，自本年一月以來，任中國戰區美軍G-5）　參謀長。渠爲魏德漢將軍主要顧問，參與商討在華美軍之一切政治，經濟與機要問題，對於中國　識，頗負時　。此文內容精　，特由本報編　室譯出，以　讀者。　編者</p>
<p>美國陸軍中曾在多山而遼遠的中國西部服務過的人，都一致同意中國各地區在人生觀和生活方式上具有極大的差別。例如雲南人比起四川人，湖南人或者貴州人，在服裝和生活上都大相懸殊。就是在一省之內也有極大的不同。</p>
<p>在一個觀察家偶然的看起來，這種風俗和語言上的不同，服裝和禮貌上的不同，正是東方令人神往的地方，但在不久之後，他就會發覺造成這抓文化上差異的原因，乃是嚴重病熊的徴象。假如中國要發揮她國家內在的潛力，必須趕緊加以校正才是。</p>
<p>經濟努力　須顧到全國利益</p>
<p>一個嚴重的徴象，就是一區　對不能把它過多的產品去滿足另一區的需要。可能一省中饑　流行　鄰近的一省中却食物過剩</p>
<p>假如我們，把隔離所造成的悽慘生活置之不顧，似乎還是聽其自然的好，誰都知道就是開闢公路，鐵路和航空綫到這種遙遠的地方去也決不能立刻有所收獲，因爲那裏地區太遼闊，地形太困難了。當地最大多數的人民都過着最低劣的生活，僅憑最簡陋的工具去進行他們的生存競爭。</p>
<p>可是從中國國家的立塲來看，她顯然在經濟，社會和政治發展上必須走上一個新的時代。農業是中國最大多數民衆唯一的謀生方法，所以必須改良發展，爲達到這個目的，沿海各商業都市和製造中心是極關重要的，可是海岸地帶的經濟努力必須以全國的利益爲目標才成。</p>
<p>中國農民　不能够接近市場</p>
<p>本人（作者自構）是伊渥華州人，該州也以農業生產爲主，所以我對中國農民的種種問題，極感興趣。在伊渥華州，交通已經發展到一種程度，可使農業與工業相彷的規模進行。農民把農作物運到市塲上去，可以遍銷國內外。他獲得現款，可以用來購買製浩品，因而增加了他生活的舒適，生產的能力和賺錢的方法，而同時又减少了他的勞動。美國農民的現款收入，以人頭計算，還比不上都市中人，但是他的生活水準和敎育機會，或許比全世界任何地方的農民還要好，至於和中國農民比較起來，那麼在任何方面都相差得太遠了。</p>
<p>這種經濟社會地位不同的原因，依余觀之，是在中國農民不能接近市塲去出售他的貨物，或者購買其他的商品。今日中國境內隔離的情形，使工業經濟和農業經濟間無從獲得正常的平衡。沿海的製造商，由於缺乏適當的交通工具，覺得他的市塲非常窄狹，至於農民，不但不能照公平價格出售他的生產品，抑且無從自製造商處獲得現代的工具和設備而享文明之賜。</p>
<p>根本之圖　需現代交通系統</p>
<p>以前我和大多數的美國人一樣想法，以爲中國最迫切的需要就是一個改良的學校制度，因而可使全國民衆共享敎育的福利。現在我知道這不渦是問題的一部份。這並不是說敎育的價値小，乃是說在敎育無法深入孤僻地區之前，是不能發生效力的。在交通工具沒有改善之前，書籍甚至敎師都不能接近學生，同時，在生產區未能接近市塲時，就是敎育也沒有多大意義。</p>
<p>結論似乎是很淸楚的：解決中國經濟社會病態的最好方法，就是成立一個現代的交通系統，但是有幾種因素妨礙了它的發展。其中主要的一個，就是極厲害的守舊觀念。在中國，猶如在其他國家一樣，許多人總喜歡維持現狀，不大願意改進。這種觀念的主要危險，就是它往往有發展爲習慣的傾向。今日中國雖尙有內戰的威脅以及對日戰争結束後的種種複雜問題，然爲國家的前途計，就得防止這種守舊觀念來阻撓進步。</p>
<p>水災饑饉　立非不可避免的</p>
<p>另一個反對觀念我時常聽到人家口頭講的，就是流行於中國的水災，饑饉，窮苦和疾病，被認爲是必要的災禍，以爲沒有了它們中國會有人滿之患。這並不是新的理論，而是十九世紀經濟學家馬爾　斯的學說。在歐洲，這種學說現在不過在學術探討中聊備一格而已。由於醫師，工程師和科學家工作的突飛猛進，西方的領袖和平民已經使他們的國家成爲更好的安居樂業之所，生活的新境界重復展開在他們的前面。這並不是說一切事情都已達到理想的程度；我們還得克服戰爭，種族的迫害，陳腐的思想和疾病，雖然我們還有幾種缺陷，尤其是戰爭，彷彿隨進步而更趨嚴重，可是從大體上說，歐美人民可以接受現代文明的賜與，而使每一個人享有世界上向所未有的更多的東西。</p>
<p>發展中國　應當從大處着眼</p>
<p>第三個甚至更重大的障礙，就是中外工商業領袖未能領導中國去發展她在現代世界中的地位。恢復和發展中國的交通不單是政府的責任；公路，航空綫，鐵路，電話，無綫電以及中國國內貿易的運輸問題，大部份須出私人出資經營；他們私人的利益果然不能忽視，但必須爲中國遠大的前途着眼，假如中國沒有這種領導，就難望在現代世界列眏中佔有重要的位置，同時，如在這方面發展國力，那麼她的工業和財政勢將無法超越戰前的地位。</p>
<p>美國在戰爭期間，對於公路及飛機塲的支出，加上中國政府迫於軍事上的需要所籌劃的計劃，已經開關了中國若干地區，此種地區以前是祗靠原始交通工具的。不過，這一供獻僅是開端而已，中國西部的公路，　路面而能够支持大批車輛不絕往來者極少。鐵路不能充份發揮其運輸媒介的功能，除非現在的路軌及車輛予以相當的改進。大家認爲可以解決所有中國交通問題的飛機與無綫電，其功能上亦屬有限。</p>
<p>上海文明　必須帶到西部去</p>
<p>上海及其他沿海城市，可當作進入外面世界的大門，是技術知識，信用貸款和企業的調簡地，也唯有這種地方才能使意想中的計劃成爲現實。不過，沿海地區的文明，照西方說法，是現代化的，必須負起其自身的使命，將進步所得的敎訓帶到西部去，這並不就是說中國唯一的解救辦法乃是將產業技術的文明硬加到農業各省古老的生活方式上去。實際上，這兩種文化勢必互柑融和而現代的中國亦得以淸淸楚楚是中國式的性格和哲學出現。</p>
<p>上海和紐約一樣，是一個國際的都市，但是如果因爲這國際性而竟使其誤認為與中國其他部份不相連續，別具獨立的意思則實屬不幸。這在某種程度上果然是不可避免的；紐約亦以與國內其他部份的問題相遠離聞名於世，但是紐約的費本和工業技術曾在美國經濟發展上盡過重要的力量。上海佔據相似的地位並且有相同的責任。如果上海的文化生活是國際性的，則其經濟生活應該嚴格地是國家性質的，因爲上海的幸福是與整個國家的幸福不可分離的。</p>
<p>今日中國　有其偉大的前途</p>
<p>中國在米有多大進步之前，近遇着許多必須解次的問題是極其明白的。國民經濟的現狀，過份膨脹的　貨，生活程度的高漲，消費的缺乏，內戰的威脅以及混亂的政治局面，在在亟急及早解次。但是，雖然有這種種問題中國今日正站在前途無量的路上，而且是歷史上所未有的。</p>
<p>對於在中國的外人，前途是良好的。中國政府覺察到外國資太和專鬥技術在發展新中國方面的價直。新中國需要這種東西，但是必須和別國接受外國資本與專門技術一樣，沒有特別讓步或治外法權，這事實是値得讚揚的，如果外國或者外國公司有中國所需要的貨物出售或者到中國來服務，他們的國民一定受到歡迎。在我看來，似乎資本投資和個人企業的機會祇能被資本家投資的願望和個人的生產能力所限制。這是自由經濟的兩個基本條件。除此而外，我們不能希望中國更進一步。</p>
<p>美國對中國的信心，就是南北戰爭後，我們發展美國西部的信心，也就是促使美國在此次戰爭中支助中國的信心。我相信這種信心在和平時期也次不會減低或喪失其重大的意義。</p>
<h3>在中國的國際聯盟　重慶嘉陵賓館剪影　路透社特派員康培爾述</h3>
<p>褐色三層樓的嘉陵賓記，位在　樹木叢生的斜坡上，面臨着嘉陵江，把這旅舍與級約的華爾道夫，倫敦的道塞夏等大旅館來比，在舒適上牠祗能屈居三等，但在國際外交上的地位，牠却與後者那些一樣高，因爲許多國家的使節，都擠在牠的二間套房和二十六個臥室裘，雖然祗裝着紙窗，竹質天花板，和蓆質地板，但五年來外國的大使館和外交團却都把牠當作總處，例如巴西，阿根廷，墨西哥，瑞典，波蘭，挪戚，伊朗，葡萄牙，及比利時等</p>
<p>旅行雜誌和旅行指南上，稱這地方是　華宮，是重慶最摩登最奢華的旅館。</p>
<p>嘉陵賓館是在沒有　年以前，化了二十五萬元，爲招待不斷地經過這戰時陪都的外賓而蓋的，「針適」和「便利，」並不最合乎理想，薄薄的牆壁，可以使一個拉丁美洲人和歐洲的國家相互偵知其外交政策，或是互通款曲。</p>
<p>這裏唯一的爭執，都起因於「古玩」，巴西的大使，企圖在使館內開一所博物院，他把各式的瓶，佛像，西藏攏件，翠玉，念佛珠，拜墊等等，統統往他那僅有一臥房，一客室，一浴室的使館內搬。</p>
<p>館內執事人員，不時踱入他的套房，把那九百件古玩的價値，不憚煩瑣地評長論短。</p>
<p>墨西哥大使住的是館內另一大套房；其他大使，參事，秘書，參贊等人物，都擠在臥室與辦公室合併的房間裏。那新近榮任的阿根廷大使，祗得在樓下的小餐堂將就了！</p>
<p>重慶的大批耗子和臭虫，果然令人討厭，可是，外交家們照樣也和每個人一般地對付過去。</p>
<p>嘉陵賓館在陪都是最快樂的一個去處。每一次國定節日，每一次民旅英雄的誕辰或忌日，都可成爲舉行「派對」的藉口；那時，大使階級人物，彈彈鋼琴，玩玩吉他，談　手相，方糖變紙戲法，他們完全沒有外交　的矜持啦！</p>
<p>此地的一次飯宴，實無異是把全球人士的大集合！庖廚裏的出品，純粹英國化，外交家們對此中意與否，一任客便。</p>
<p>外交家們穿梭似步入廚房，希望烹成一色純粹家鄕味的菜餚。</p>
<p>主持嘉陵賓館的是一位姓徐的，是從前在上海的保險箱製造商。他很懂得辦理逆旅的秘訣，那便是：「開得越遠越佳！」</p>
<h3>近衛文麿　自掘墳墓</h3>
<p>日本的「白面首相」，侵華戰爭的鼓手—近衛文麿終於在前晚畏罪自殺了！這個消息的傳來，在我，覺得可驚異，然而也並不覺得驚異。所可驚異的一點，是從他的絕命書上看來，他一方面想承認他對於這一塲血戰八年的侵華戰爭負起責任來，但在另一方面部又圖狡賴一切，（這顯得他至死不悟，終於還是一個不負責任的道地侵略家。近衛自掘墳墓，已由八年來的歷史提供了鐵一般的實據，侵華戰爭的發動，是他自掘堵墓之第一步工程，而日本的投降，便是他自掘的墤墓之落成。照此說來，畏罪殺的一幕，就是近衛的最後一隻材釘。如今，蓋棺論定，近衛是侵略中國的主要戰爭犯，然而「一棺戰身」，豈能「萬事都已」？</p>
<p>中國的人民乃至全世界愛好正義和平的人民，都有權利要求審判他，嚴懲他，正如我國歷史上有過「鞭屍三百」一樣的處理他。因爲他殺自已，是畏罪，同時，爲了鼓吹侵華行動之故，正還殺害了萬萬千千的中國人民，甚至殺害了多少不願作戰的日本人民。對於這樣一個創子手，怎麼可以讓他「一了百了」呢？</p>
<p>近衛從登塲到下塲，前後一共五十六年。一八九一年生，十四歲喪父。他便在父執輩西園寺手下撫養成人，後入帝都帝大法政系，越三年，隨西園寺至巴黎出席和會，耳濡目染，久已獲得西園寺的衣缽。自此以後，他就打入了日本「重臣」階級，有好幾次被邀入閣，但他總是拒絕，到了二二六事變發生後，西園寺推薦他組閣，他也還能「拜辭大命」，但那時他組織了什麼東洋協會，南洋協會之類，自命爲「會長」。這一個時期，可說是近術侵華戰罪之準備時期。隨着林銑十郎的下台，近衛官　在挽回所謂「日本危局」的條件下達到滿足了。一上台，馬上就發動了「華北事件」，跟着關東軍源源入關，從日本國內動員了三師團，出動了飛機百餘架，進攻平津，一方面他說「不變不擴大方針」，另方面他却派出了日機飛遍了我全國領空。在「近衛三原則」「不變不擴大方針」的「原則」和「方針」發展的過程中，我國的平民和軍人所遭到的嚴重損失，眞是罄竹難書。這一時期，可以說是近衛侵華行動的萌芽時期。</p>
<p>我國當局在賢明英烈的　蔣委員長領導之下，開始攻破了近衛侵華的陰謀，於是近衛只得換花樣，提出所謂「大東亞新秩序」，「長期作戰」。這個巴戲—所謂「近衛聲明」—又被我國當局攻擊得體無完膚。近衛就嚇得抱頭鼠竄，下臺完結。這是近衛侵華行動的發動時期。</p>
<p>但近衛是不甘下臺的。他看到民國廿九年六月，德國在歐洲獲勝，丹，挪，荷，比，法，諸國一一陷入德國手下，便認定這是他東山再起的好機會，於是再度投機，出而組閣。所謂「日德義三國軍事同盟」，便是那時的「最大傑作」。蘇德戰爭發生後，松岡去職，又令近衛內閣第二次改組，軍閥氣燄益不可遏。平沼被剌後，近衛第三次內閣便吿崩壞。總計他登臺到下臺，前後三度組閣，總是以「竭盡全力解決戰爭」爲口實，暗地裏踐行其　棧之實際，所以一次又一次的在那裏閙鬼把戲。</p>
<p>日本以第一次近衛組閣而形成侵華戰爭之序幕，又以第二次近衛組閣而陷於國際的孤立，又以第三次近衛組　，　閣，與東條的上臺，而造成太平洋戰　。　一運串的戰罪，　　由　　負　，應該由聯合國嚴懲，決不是　殺所能了事的。（亞農）</p>
<p>……罪該萬死的近衛</p>
<h3>東京地攤</h3>
<p>日本軍閥之罪，罄竹難書，聯合國方面爲解救日人之倒懸，乃以原子炸彈　吿彼等，而和平之曙光始現。東京遭轟炸後，日平民無處可住，無力求生，地　生涯，所在都是。圖示東京商人在人行道旁設地撫，顧客踩地檢視食品之情形</p>
<h3>社論　近衛自殺死有餘辜！</h3>
<p>—日本人民宜自贖前愆—</p>
<p>昨日東京急電：侵華禍首近衛文麿，已於十五日晚畏罪自殺。近衛以少年公子，出任閣揆，有「白面首相」之號，自負不凡，日本國民亦曾寄以相當之屬　，可是八年之間，三度組閣，不獨燃起全面侵華的砲火，抑且發蹤指示，在幕後發動太平洋戰爭。二次世界大戰，人類所受空前的浩　，簡直可說拜受近衛之賜。麥帥　爲戰犯，下令逮捕，理所當然。近衛在日本投降以後，也曾公開聲明，自陳應負侵華戰事之全責，此番明知投案之日，罪難　免，日暮途窮，自殺　命。語　：多行不義必自　。又　：自作孽，不可活。近衛之有今日，完全近　自作孽；近　的自　，完全爲多行不義的結果，不值深論。不過就日本來說，就中國來說，近衛雖自斃，還是死有餘辜；而這餘辜，必須日本人民努力自贖的。</p>
<p>一個民族，興盛起來並不容易；一個國家，建設起來更是艱難。日本原爲東方島國，數千年來沐受中國文化的薰陶蔭庇，一且變法維新，發　圖治，自明治以還，五十年間，經營擘劃，居然躋於眏國之林。而首次歐戰，更予以充分發展的機會，東亞大局，幾　日本之爲首是瞻。可惜日本在那時，就口唱王道，實行　術，專心致志，以獨覇亞洲，混一宇　爲鴣的。</p>
<p>國父於一九二五年北上道經日本時，苦口婆心，一再勸吿，而言者諄諄，聽者藐藐。海陸軍閥，少壯武人，中風狂走，原不足怪，而何以元老重臣，貴族策士，都沒有一個稍具慧眼，能抱遠見的人，可以挽其在瀾，保其國運？</p>
<p>日本自二二六事件發生，岡田首相遭暴徒狙擊，造成一二五後的另一政治慘劇，軍人氣燄日益囂張，廣田弘毅不能制，林銑十郎無可爲，近衛當日負有時望，又爲西園寺公所器重，各方也都以軍人與政黨間的橋樑相期許，以爲近衛庶幾可以稍　軍閥的瘋在，大有「斯人不出，如薈生何」之槪。近衛如果自忖無可挽救，何苦自尋煩惱？而旣毅然組閣，便應洞識日本應如何持盈保泰，如何親仁善鄰，如何　鈴繫鈴，以束北四省歸還中國，重修陸誼，以啓束亞和平之門。而乃不此之圖，組閣方　　月，　發動蘆溝橋事變，揭開全面侵華的序幕。從此日本在侵華戰爭中，泥足愈陷愈深，無以自　，而更眏調戰事體制，爲東條英機發動太平洋戰爭作前驅，終於烽火蔓延，人民塗炭，向聯合國屈膝求降而後已。我們想：以數千年沐受中國文化，數十年努力效法歐美，積漸富強，雄視一方的日本，不及八年，明治功業，盡付流水。成功之難如彼，毀敗之易如此！近衛當可以有爲之日，居可以有爲之地，。因有心敷衍，八面討好，逢迎軍閥，搆煽侵略，而招致毀滅國家的惡果。就日本論近衛，蓋棺論定，豈非死有餘辜？</p>
<p>再就中國來說：近衛登台而後，一方面花言巧語，希望「中日提携」，一方面就用砲火槍彈，屠殺中國人民。別的不說，只要一讀昨天本報特約記者所描寫的八年前南京大屠殺的慘象，十幾萬男女老幼所遭受奸淫殺戮的地獄生活，我們就永遠不會忘記近衛發動侵略的罪戾，也相信世界人類必不會寬恕日寇的暴行。松井石根從中國回去時，似曾說過將削髮爲僧，以示懺悔。這種罪孽豈是一聲懺悔便可了事？</p>
<p>本來中日同文之邦，數千年來中國眏大的時候，日本並未亡國。而近百年間，中外互市，講信修睦，只要日本不加緊侵略，逼使中國不能生存，則縱有甲午　敗之恥，馬　條約之辱，也可循着平等途徑，改善　交，而經濟提携，平等互惠，則以中日壤地相接，自更易於達成。可是日本在近衛三度組閣的期間，偏偏不向這方面走，偏偏不肯自己認錯，一定要錯到底，一定要勾結一二漢奸敗類，而以中國四萬萬人民爲敵，遂致數百萬形同野獸的寇軍浪人，在中國到處逞兇發威，虐殺刧奪，造成了中國人民對日寇恨如剌骨的心理。目前我國民政府對待日本，固然寬大，然而就人民的立塲說，人民受了日寇的屠殺刦掠，是永遠不會忘記的。今天居然還能在街道上騎馬往來的日本軍人，就是當年受了近衛以至後繼內閣的命令到中國來　行屠殺的瘋在野獸！我們一天看到這些野獸們還在中國領土上出現，就一天不會忘記近衛的罪孽。而中國爲鞏固世界和平計，爲保證東方不再有侵略的日本重復出現計，必須堅持嚴懲日本一切大小戰犯，尤其侵華的戰犯，更必須摧毀日本的軍閥政制，使今後的日本人民眞能從愛好和平自由的再敎育中受到「人性」的培養。從這些今後我們應該千萬努力的工作上，回想起來，近衛之有負於中國，實在是死有餘辜的。</p>
<p>進一步看：近衛的罪孽，不僅是近衛的自作孽，而是日本人民的自作孽；不僅是近衛的多行不義，而是日本人民的多行不義。有這樣的日本人民，纔有這樣的日本政制；有這樣的日本政制，纔產生這樣的日本政治人物。故近衛的發動侵華，準備世界大戰，可以看做日本人民瘋在行爲的代表。也許我們可以嚴責日本軍閥而寬恕日本人民，以爲日本人民處於軍閥淫威之下，亦屬無可如何。但軍閥何以會產生，何以會把持政柄，何以會讓近衛不能不俯首帖耳，低首下心以仰軍閥之鼻息，我們仍不能不本「春秋責備賢者」之義，責備日本人民。故日本人民應該知道，今後當以全心全力做一個和平善良的人，來自贖以往橫行覇道的罪戾。語有之，「自求多福」。日本人民鑒於近衛之自殺斃命，絲毫不必憐惜近衛，也不應該原諒近衛，更不宜以爲近衛之自殺由於聯合國之逼迫，而抱怨聯合國。却反而應當痛澈覺悟，近衛乃有負於日本，有負於中國，更有負於世界人類，雖死不足以蔽其辜，而日本人民正應努力改正過去的錯誤，以圖今後的自贖，以自求其將來的多福。</p>
<h3>野獸的嘴臉　閒談近衛</h3>
<p>近衛文應的名字內，有一「文」字，揆其一生侵華史跡，實然有負於「文」。換句話說，太「武」了。</p>
<p>他平日愛讀文藝作品，企圖拿這個假面具掩飾其侵略之實。但是狐狸尾巴拖出來了；他愛好的是低級趣味的文藝，描寫靑年兩性生活的文藝，菊池寬之流的文藝。</p>
<p>近衛做過冒牌新聞記者，因爲他以西園寺隨員之資格，照例不能出席巴黎和平會議他就詐稱記者參加其間，事後曾被西園寺訓斥了一頓。</p>
<p>有一次，近衛姪女結婚時，舉行化裝跳舞會，近衛便親赴淺草，購辦一副假鬍鬚，扮成了希特勒的鬼臉而出塲於舞會。他倆同樣以自　　　塲，說者謂爲「事出有因」「無獨有偶」。</p>
<p>西報對近衛的再三組閣，喜稱之曰，換一頂「帽子」而已。</p>
<p>如今，近衛畏罪自殺了，我們覺得，他何不及早換一個「腦子」，倒或者不致出此「自殺」之下策吧！　（慕生）</p>

<h3>蚌埠之雜糧</h3>
<p>〔本報特訊〕皖北雜糧，在蚌埠未繁榮以前，以懷遠爲集散地。民初倪嗣冲督皖，駐節蚌埠，對於振興蚌埠市面，經營不遺餘力，用人力關設船塘，以通舟楫，淮河上游下駛糧船，可直達蚌埠，懷遠之雜糧市面，遂移轉於蚌埠。是蚌埠成爲一皖北雜糧集散市塲，僅有二十餘年之歷史。</p>
<p>雜糧產地　沿淮河上游及下游各地，均以產雜糧著，如穎州，毫州，渦陽，蒙城，正陽關，及五河等處，尤爲著名。所產雜糧，以黃豆小麥爲大宗，次爲高梁，菉豆，芝蔴，花生仁，大麥，小豆餅。黃豆之旺銷期爲十月，小麥之旺銷期爲六月；每年六月十月間，客商雲集，蚌埠，採辦客商，以上海帮，無錫帮，常州帮，爲巨擘。事變以前，蚌埠年銷黃豆六百萬擔，小麥八百萬擔，在敵僞侵佔時期，對於雜糧，加以嚴厲之統制，黃豆一項，統制尤嚴，非得到敵軍部之許可，絕對禁止出口，是以在此時期，黃豆及小麥等產銷，無正確之估計。</p>
<p>糧行組織　事變以前，蚌埠有雜糧行五十四家，抗戰勝利以後，收復區商業欣欣向榮，日趨繁盛，現蚌埠有雜糧行一百餘家。此間糧行，均兼營食豐業務，皖北之食鹽亦以蚌埠爲集散地，沿淮河一帶，其食鹽之來源，均仰給於蚌埠，糧船到時，蚌埠銷售雜糧後，即裝載食鹽回去，事變以前，以蚌埠糧船一項而言，每大蚌埠銷鹽，在五千擔左右。此間糧行之特點，一爲兼營食鹽；二則此問糧行，分爲賣出行家及買進行家二種。賣出行家，規模較小，僅代各糧船戶挽銷生意，收取佣金，買進行家，規模較大，因有時須代客帮墊付款項，此閒糧行，以仁大·半中·元復·昌豐·元隆·錫成等規模爲較大，營業亦較為發達，同業間亦有糧業公會之組織。</p>
<p>雜糧運銷　離蚌埠約里許，爲糧船停泊集中地，名曰新船塘，爲前皖督倪嗣冲用人力所開闢，每日所停泊之糧船，平均在二千號以上，桅　林立，首尾相接，在新船塘未開關以前，來蚌糧船，不能逕泊蚌埠碼頭，自新船塘闢，來往糧船稱便。沿淮河一帶所生產之雜糧，均由船戶裝儎來蚌，其間有客戶委託船戶裝載，或由船戶自已集資採辦裝運，糧船到達新船塘後，則將樣品逕送於賣出行家。賣出行家及買進行家，在新船塘，均雇有小船，上插各該行家之旗幟，每日早晨，各客帮則各到素做往來之行家船上，此種行家，　爲買進行家，在買進行家船上，則有該行之　樣職員守候，賣出行家船上則有各該行之職員，特同　糧船戶所裝載之樣品，駛向各該買進行家船上挽銷，如市價雙方談判接近，則由賣出行家信同買進行家客人到糧船上　樣，覆樣無誤後，即行　局，由買進行家飭人帶同蔴袋至糧船上裝包，是成交已吿一段落，定局時並不付給定洋，完全以買進行家信義爲主，看樣，騐貨，成交均在船上，是可謂水上交易。每日早上，小船來往如梭，　幟　　，熙往　來，實爲市塲別開生面。買進行家代客買貨，收取備金寧爲百分之二。</p>
<p>斗行組織　蚌埠　糧另一特點，　斗行之組織，此間雜糧裝包。均為蚌埠七斗裝，以黃豆一項而言，此間七斗，合上海二百二十市斤左右。此間水上交易雜糧賣出買進，均由斗行代爲過斛：過斛手續完備後，則由斗行收取若干費用，收取費用，以每包爲單位，目前約收十數元，是蚌埠雜糧交易，除賣買行家外，尙有一斗行參與其間，不啻爲這磅時一證人。再蚌埠黃豆以外銷為主，小麥則本市亦有極大銷路，蚌埠有寳典，信豐二大麵粉廠，事變以前，實興廠每天需小麥一千一百包，信　規模較小，每天的需六百包左右。（珊）</p>

<p>請求澈底改革</p>
<p>要求改革的呼聲太高，但一般均能瞭解同情，體念時艱，不主張消極的罷課，及作無謂的遊行示成，而主張建議政府，請求澈底改革，（三）增設貸金補助金，救濟上海貧苦學生，（四）改善敎職員待遇，（五）請敎育當局整頓校舍校風，並多聘敎授及增加圖書儀器設備，（六）多設體育設備，增進學生健康，（七）請政府立即舉辦軍事訓練，（八）請政府當局肅淸敎育界奸逆，及停辦商業化學校，中午十二時散會。</p>

<h3>到農村去　放下販子的包裹　換上盛種子的袋袋</h3>
<p>美國農業學校創立五十週紀念　追述俄國大文豪托爾期泰名言</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十五日電〕俄國文豪托爾斯泰，雖未嘗足蒞美土，但美國一所獨特的專門致力於農事的學校，却是遵照他的願望設立起來的。道就是美國農業學校，地址在本薜爾凡尼亞州的陶依爾斯鐵，今年恰是立校五十週年紀念。</p>
<p>追溯學校創設的歷史，首先該說到費城的一個美國猶太人克勞斯夫法學博士。博士在一八九四年訪問俄國，胸中擬有一個計劃，想把世界各地橫遭迫害的猶太人，移殖到俄國內部無人居住地方，去開墾荒地，以稼穡爲生。這時沙皇亞歷山大三世齊巧患病很重，博士無由覲見沙皇，面陳這個建議。托爾斯泰向來是竭力主張過農村生活的，聽見了這個訊息，就邀請博士到他的家裏，就在那顆「窮苦樹」下聽博士的訴述。托爾斯泰慣常在這顆樹下聽窮困無吿的人訴苦，現在聽了博士的意見，他就批評道：</p>
<p>「你有志欲率領你的人民重歸泥土，回復到你祖先在巴勒斯坦所榮譽從事的職業，確實給我一些鼓勵，顯示天已微明，光明在望，這是猶太問題惟一的解決辦法。猶太人到處受人迫害，不准該有田地或耕種田地，不准加入工會，結果都不得不靠經商過活，而商賈却是世人所痛恨的啊。使你的人民變爲生產麵包的人，就會得到世人的尊敬。猶太殖民地的計劃，想在俄國實行，現在很少希望，但是假使這計劃不能在俄國推行，爲什麼不可以在美國成功呢，率領你的人民到鄕間去，到農村去，替他們設立農業學校，敎他們，丟掉碼尺，拿起鋤頭，放下販子的包裏，換上盛種子的袋袋，道就可以解決那尙待解決的問題了。將來你會在他們的出地上，看見充滿着牛奶蜂蜜，仍舊像從前一樣。他們拿多餘的東西，供給當地的人民，轉而得到盈利和別人的尊敬。於是又會在猶太農夫中興起許多預言者，立法家，詩人和敎師，被文明世界所歌頌讚揚！」</p>
<p>托爾斯泰的願望果然在一八九六年實現，因爲美國農業學校就在這一年成立的。學校最初設立的目的，是在敎育城市中的靑年，特別是猶太靑年，使其受一種農業訓練，出校以後，就可以實地從事農作。五十年來，美國各大城市的靑年子弟，都聞風來學。開始的時候，只有一座校舍，一百二十二畝田地，現在年年擴充，已經包括所有農事，農塲管理，推銷，蒔花，園藝，等各部門。校中絲毫沒有黨派色彩，學生都是十七歲至二十一歲的靑年。共同生活，共同在田地上勞作，共同在課堂內讀書，共同在草塲上遊戲，眞是一片天眞！</p>
<h3>助學金籃球義賽　奧西納聯珠妙射　華聯隊力戰受挫　中靑隊敗於美海蜂　明晚兩場最後決戰</h3>
<p>本報與同德醫學院聯合主辦之助學金中美籃球義賽，昨晚第二夕，以中美冠軍相逢角逐，節目精彩，雖天有微雨，球迷仍擁擠不堪，情况較第一夕更爲熱烈。結果華聯經劇烈之競爭，僅以三分之差四十三比四十受挫於奧西納，上半時奧隊以二十四比十九佔先。中靑海蜂之戰，中靑以二十比三十一敗北。</p>
<p>先盛後衰　中靑受挫中靑會美海蜂首先登場，裁判兪菊廬宣鶴　。銀笛鳴處，大戰開始，美隊戰術巧妙，中靑亦頗知謹愼從事，競爭異常劇烈，上半時中靑果以十對九佔先一分。下半時中靑以連日大戰，不免有力竭之象，美海蜂乘隙而進，連獲四球，以十八對十分後來居上，中靑乃用車輪戰術，頻頻換人，何金貴時來運來，奪得四分，漸見接近，但美軍愈戰愈勇，中靑會力不勝人，無可奈何，美海蜂以三十一對十，擊敗中靑，美海蜂左鋒密契爾得分獨多，矯健可畏。</p>
<p>華聯居先　難解難分美軍冠軍隊奧西納與華聯之戰，繼之開始，觀衆精神為之一振，裁判梁兆安陳亮。戰局在王曉籟氏開球後展開，華聯勃脫，陳學祟連袂中的，先獲兩球，但奧隊急起值追四—四，六—六，八—八，一〇—一〇，一二—一二，戰局成膠着狀態，難解難分，球塲空氣，緊張萬分，華聯始終居先，球迷大爲興奮。美軍連中　局面一變</p>
<p>美軍急謀打開戰局，變更戰略，果然一氣呵成，連中十分，局面遂爲之一變。華聯急呼暫停，重行佈置，李震中以最妙之傳遞，穿花挾蝶，極盡球藝之表演，乃得漸漸追上，上半時奧西納二四，華聯一九分。</p>
<p>球無虛發　華聯苦戰</p>
<p>下半時開始，奧西納氣勢仍盛，隻手投籃，幾無虛發，嘆為觀止，美軍遂躍居前導，頃刻以三十四比二十三佔先。華聯雖在重重壓力之下，繼續苦戰，採用遠射，頗有成就，惟得失之間，終保持一差數，雖越追越近，奈時間有限，奧西納以四三對四勝退華聯。</p>
<p>明晚次勝　最後兩塲</p>
<p>明日（十八日）下午七時半起，為最後兩塲，仍在原處交鋒，華隊仍由中靑華聯應戰美海靑及奧西納兩隊，決勝在此一舉，當有更劇烈之競爭，秩序如下：</p>
<p>美海靑—華聯藥　七時半</p>
<p>奧西納—中靑會　八時半</p>
<h3>聯歡足球賽給獎　東華勝英海軍</h3>

<h3>晨友杯籃球賽</h3>
<p>今日兩場</p>
<p>德勝—飛馬（甲組）五時半</p>
<p>協興—晨友（甲組）六時半</p>
<h3>國立復旦大學的農學院</h3>
<p>— 計英儔</p>
<p>復且大學自西遷大後方文化區北碚後，即改爲國立。現分設文，理，工，農，商，法等六個學院。敎授和學生，共有四千餘人。在嘉陵江北岸，黃桷樹鎭與東陽鎭中間，蔚然成了一個大學城；沿江一行長長的整齊的桐樹，把這大學城點綴得更加美麗。</p>
<p>是四百多畝地的一塊原野，背山面水，雖然沒有巍巍雄偉的黌舍，可是一列又一列錯雜的復大的平屋，雜以籬落小橋，簡單樸素，倒也顯得莊穆淸幽，洋溢着一種鄕村所特有的寗靜，實在是一個讀書的好環境。校內到處花木扶疏，四時之景不同，想莘莘學子，樂亦無窮也。</p>
<p>復旦有此「地利」，便盡力發展農學院，大學生一邊在敎室裏研究，一邊在農塲上實習，智識經騐，互相印證，養成一個飽學的現代農人，是國家重工業化的後援的一支生力軍。</p>

<h3>各輪運費票價　元旦起統一規定　航業公會請配售燃料</h3>
<p>勝利以後，我政府對於各綫復航，至為關切，奈因燃料缺乏，各綫不能暢通，時駛時輟，班期不準，特設燃料管理委員會，以為運用支配，所有進口之煤，統歸該會管理，惟一部民營航輪，尚未得配售，以致購買黑市煤，但黑市煤每噸須十萬元左右，官價每噸祇二萬四千元，相差四倍有奇，因之航商為維持血本起見，將運費票價</p>
<p>各自增價　影響行旅，妨礙土產流通，間接增漲物價，此種情形，關係甚鉅，各航商屢向輪船業同業公會申訴前情，該會對各會員之陳訴，確認目前航業最大打擊，厥為燃料不足，經屢次集議後，決呈請航政司長，暨本市航政局，及燃料管理委員會等，設法予以補救，并歷陳應優先配售燃料七項事宜，至關於客票價格，運費水腳，過去各公司自行訂定，高低不一，交通部於日前令本市航政局</p>
<p>統一價目　該局已轉資輪船業同業公會，則予整頓，業經航政局長李孤帆，公會秘書李雲良，該會費率委員會主任委員胡時淵等，數度集議，并徵求會員意見，已決定於三十五年元旦起，運費票價，一律不得擅自增減，以資劃一，該項價格，現正續訂中，不久即可公佈。</p>

<h3>美軍供應品　充斥市上</h3>
<p>自美軍來滬後，大量供應品源源而來，同時其黑市亦應運而生。免稅之香煙·啤酒·朱古力糖·罐頭食品·等到處可見。美軍買香煙一包，只費美金八分，而黑市美國香煙，則索價國幣五百元以上。近以聖誕將臨，美軍供應品較前增多，黑市乃益趨繁榮。考其原因，以美軍下士每月所得約五十美金，軍方雖供彼衣着與飲食，但上海各舞場與娛樂場所，均是使人揮金如土之地，有不少美軍士兵，在領薪後即盡量揮霍，不數日而囊空如洗，只得出賣其所有之軍中供應品，以補償經濟方面之拮据。美國人民有「軍隊第一」之口號，常盡量節省物資以供其海外軍隊。</p>

<h3>重現光明　恢復市區路燈</h3>
<p>本市路燈在敵偽時代，因受燈火管制關係，一律改用五支光度，再加防空罩，其他交通燈，月臺燈，碼頭燈，公園燈全部拆毀，故八晚異常黑暗。自本市光復以後，始由當局設法更換燈泡，逐步整理，各路均已大放光明，惟赤峰市閘北等一部分市區路燈，因當時損毀太甚，目前限于物力人力，尚未能立即完全恢復，目下已由公用局派員在中華路，民國路，和平路凝和路，蓬萊路，方浜路等區恢復三百五十餘盞，并定在農暦年內，就其他衝要各路次第裝設，以便市民。</p>
<h3>參觀日俘集中營　希望他們反省覺悟　花園部隊都很愉快</h3>
<p>昨天上午第三方面軍京滬區戰俘管理處招待本市中外記者，舉行茶會，　問由王兼處長光漢報告該處工作經過情形，并陪同記者參觀三個集中營，其中一個是女軍屬，所謂花園部隊。也許有人認為我們管理戰俘尤其日本戰俘，覺得太　待，其實在「以德報怨」和「重道尚義」下我們對他們已經戰敗的一君，也不值得打落水狗。現在我們應該使他們有一個反省，覺悟過去的錯誤，希望他們回國後，重新認識中國，重新建立一個民主的新日本。</p>
<p>第一個去參觀的是江　第十六集中營，也就是過去在上海不可一世的十三軍登隆部隊人數二千四百人，負責人松井太久郞中將，在那裏我們聽到他們笸井大尉的報告，關於上海區集中情形和服役敎育　衛生的情形，他說，現在集中的　子官兵共有七萬人，分佈在江灣吳淞四十個集中營內，一切都鑒命於管理處，最近服役方面，分　　　，修理公路及鐵道三項，敎育以灣　輸新思想及改良農業為主體，再以中國語英語為　。衛生方面，在本年夏季曾發生虎列拉，致有三百人死亡，惟最近憶告絕跡。當記者提出對我國優待的感想時，參謀長土居說：不論上下官兵都非常的感激。今後自當深切反省，痛改前非。</p>
<p>第二個去參觀的是吳淞第二集中營，由梨岡少將負責，人數一千八百人，他那裏的營房是臨時由他們自己建築的，官兵所居的較簡陋，每一室大約有十二人，據梨岡云：我們缺乏智識，書籍很少，　　有改造日報一種，　　能多給精神食糧。</p>
<p>末　去參觀的是在國部隊，這個部隊，完全是女軍屬，他們由日本國內總部招募而來，人數一〇七五人，年齡自十五歲至二十四歲，她們的任務，僅担任軍中打字·電話接綫·書記和看護等職，這幾天正在練習　　手績，當王處長召集訓話時，每個人的臉部，都赤出非常的愉快。</p>
<p>因為預定在第十六集中營還有一個座談會，時間不及，所以很匆促的趕到那邊，在座談會上，彼此都很坦白的提出問題商討，直到六時才散。</p>
<p>這些日本少女，她們都是招募而來，也就是所謂花園部隊。她們站着靜聆王處長光漢的訓話，覺得愉快，也覺得戰事所給予她們的遭遇，是空虛，是殘酷，是日本軍閥的賜予。</p>
<h3>美國女兵在上海</h3>
<p>— 邁天</p>
<p>在冷落的巨　達路古拔路口，靜靜地叢立着一幢舊式巨大的洋房。大門口站着一個美國憲憲兵，顯着很孤獨的樣子。這是從前橫濱正金銀行的職員宿舍，現在呢，已變成上海美軍婦女隊（前梅美國婦女輔助隊）員（Wacs）的住宅？</p>
<p>記者特地去訪問婦女隊隊長哈門上尉。隱約聽見幽揚的琴聲，再前進到客聽，卻感受到一陣安閒舒適的感覺。只見十來個隊員，有的穿了裙子，有的穿了長褲；有站着抽煙的，有坐在地毯上縫衣服，有躺在長沙發上；還有曲了膝坐在沙發上寫信的。大家都低聲的談話，祇有一位小姐正奏着「夢中情人」。這種溫暖輕鬆的空氣，真使人不勝羨慕。後來才知道，她們這一群都屬於幸運兒，準備候船回國，所以不必工作了。</p>
<p>剛走進她們的辦公室，哈門上尉就來個電話，說：因為沒有車子不能立刻趕到。好得我也不必和她個人談話，就由一位蓓立斯上士領導着我參觀各處。據說現在上海共有婦女隊員六十二位，其中二十八位將在最近離開這裏回家，但不久還有五十左右的新隊員由美來滬。蓓小姐自己也是幸運兒中的一個，她在軍隊服務已達四十個月，她在軍隊服務已達四十個月，是資格最老隊員中的一個了。她到過印度加爾各答，又到過重慶。她以前在紐約一家百貨公司中當過書記。現在多數的隊員，都在英空軍各部担任室內工作。蓓小姐則在宿舍內担任販賣工作。</p>
<p>「戰時我們都喜歡到國外來工作，一方面為國家服務，一方面也可以看見許多新地方」，這是蓓小姐告訴我，為什麼喜歡來國外的緣故。</p>
<p>走進她們的遁藝室，襄而安放着一只乒乓桌，長方的房間相當寬敞，有光滑整潔的地板，她們平時便在那裏開跳舞會。外面是一個草地，有兩個綱球場，這壞空地給六十幾位小姐作戶外運動是足足有餘。嗣後又參觀了她們的飯廳，她們有美軍廚師二個。中飯和晚飯時間都可以請客人來，當然囉，美國兵是座上的常客了。跟着上樓參觀她們的臥室，一位桃樂　納喜小姐，也是上士，穿了一件紫紅的晟衣，在床上寫信。納小姐一看見蓓小姐，就問什麼時候有船，可是蓓小姐也不知道呢。</p>
<p>「我們都很喜歡上海，不過，當然我們都想回家囉！」納小姐說。</p>
<p>雖然僅僅談了幾句話，我發現納小姐非常誠懇和直爽，蓓小姐也十分耐心的給我講這樣講那樣。那裏的二樓三樓約共有四十間臥房，但因為要為以後來的人預備床位，所以都比較擠一點。有的房間放兩只床，有的放三只，也有睡轉床的。她們還拿出下辦公室後穿的淡荳沙色的衣服，還有冬季大衣，差不多和男軍人們的式樣相仿。納小姐說，她的東西大都已包裝好了，祇等動身的日子到來。回去時船上每人可帶一百八十五磅，平時可每月寄七十磅重的東西回家，從前在印度時僅能寄十磅東西一個月，</p>
<p>談起她們平時娛樂，也不過是買買東西，看看電影跳跳舞。很多的美國兵和永兵找她們玩，她們也感到有點頭痛。「不過，和他們認誤用時候多了，你真能發現他們都是很好的，」納小姐為那些男孩子們的胡鬧而解釋着，「他們有時和中國女孩子們講笑話，其實他們一點也不是存心的，我們因為知道他們的脾氣，所以他們也沒法跟我們胡說。」蓓小姐也加了一句說，「我們都瞭解我們的男孩子們。」</p>
<p>問起她們對於上海的印象，納小姐說：「上海不是真正的中國，重慶才代表中國」。納小姐還曾去過杭州，遊過西湖，覺得杭州非常好玩。</p>
<p>我們談了十來分鐘，已像熟朋友似的了。和納少姐告別下樓時，又蒙蓓小姐指給我看她們的販售部，櫥窗裏放着各種捲煙·糖菓·用品·還有從軍隊中交易所內買來的襯衣，鞋子，及古董等，供隊員購買。據說她們每月可得香煙三十包，每年絲襪十二雙，而事實上她們非自己添買不可。她們對於中國婦女穿的旗袍也頗為欣賞，有的已經做了好幾件，準備回家去穿。</p>
<p>正在這時候，上尉回來了，她相當年輕，很和氣而動人，她是管理所有婦女隊員的，回國的日期意得在最後一批，談起上海，我老實告訴她，已比以前退步了點。她說：「戰爭完後，要恢復以前的情形，總得在發幾年以後吧」！</p>
<p>美國婦女輔助隊的住宅，位置在比較冷僻的巨籟達路上。如果是無意的經過那里或許你不會注意到吧。這大廈裏有着許多房間，和一切必要的設備，安靜舒適，兼而有之。附設的販售部發買各種日用品，隊員們「趨之若鶩」！</p>
<p>我因為時候已經不早，也就不再作個人訊問。於是再踏上那寂靜的柏油路而告別了。</p>
<p>歸途中想起了那一群第一次來到中國的美國小姐們，她們一走和我們同樣的感覺到兩方面的隔膜依舊很深。無疑的，其中有許多人都不能真正的認識中國，瞭解中國人。這是一個很好的機會，我想，為什麼不讓我們來和她們多多接觸，共同建立真正的友誼呢！</p>

<h3>悔</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>雲：你我不寫信，我完全認錯；但你該知道我的劣根性，越是重要的事越不辦，越是該寫的信越不寫。我也明白，爲了這根性，我誤了多少事，挨了多少駡，可是根性究竟是根性，「江山好改，本性難移」，我最近的不寫信，便是這原因。</p>
<p>大又下雨了，氣壓低得悶死人，不吸烟的人正在狂抽着烟，我在大上海的小亭子間裏打轉，轉來轉去是這麼一個小圈子，我想睡，暫時忘記了一切，漠視了一切，却明知是不會睡着；我想衝出去，但又衛到那裏去呢？上海是這樣煩囂龐雜，人們又這樣自私無情，我流浪在街頭像個甚麽？我隨便跑到人家面前又為了甚麽？你該說為甚麽不給我寫信？唉，我也祇好給你胡亂的寫幾句了。</p>
<p>最剌戰我的，便是你：『從前你悄悄地走了，把我丟在鐵蹄下的上海；現在你又輕輕地走了，把我丟在煩囂中的重慶。在上海爲了鐵蹄，受過五年的災難，現在煩囂正繞着這樊籠似的重慶，我却又插翼難飛！何況我也離家八年了，你該設法讓我回家呀。』這幾句話。雲，這幾句話剌痛了我的心，我又落淚了。如果說我這次能够輕輕的飛出重慶是個「勝利」，我眞是個「慘勝」。慘勝不但是爲了和你分離，也是我到上海後一切意外痛苦的象徴。</p>
<p>我確是後悔，不該這樣天眞地獨自飛來，因爲我旣非「接收人員」，又無「登科」的野心，這樣早來做些甚麼呢？若是爲了八年不見的老父母嗎，我到上海三個月，還不曾下鄉去省視過父母。現在，徒然讓風燭殘年的老父母依然盼望着他們唯一的兒子，他們一定會咀咒：「仗打完了，為甚麼我們的兒子還不回來？」現在，又徒然讓你留在道熱鍋般的重慶，過着熱鍋上螞蟻的生活，你焦虞，你着急，是應該的。</p>
<p>我走時，留給你的是　萬塊錢的稿費，可是還留給你兩個孩子。萬塊錢，在這越勝利越貶値的時候，你能做些甚麼呢？兩個兒子十整天地嚷要吃要喝，而且大孩子又那麼的淘氣，增加了物質的負祖不算，又增加了無數的精神負担。雲，你是太苦太累了。你在上海祗有一個孩子，你已經不勝其繁，本來，照你這樣的身體，照我們這樣的景况，是不該有兒子的。你到了重慶，不幸又增加了一個，照你這樣的身體，照我們這樣的景况，更不該有兩個兒子，假如沒有兒子，八年前我們一起出亡，輕輕快快地流亡到後方。假如沒有兒子，到了後方，你便可作事，一個「文學土」儘管是女的，在機關裏當個科員是不成問題的，幾萬塊錢的薪津，一石米，你足够開支你一個人了，我們分工合作，分居生活，把兩個人全交給公家，每天餘下來的時聞却還是我們自己的，這樣我們的生活安定無憂，我們的幸福也次不會被剝奪了，就是為了兩個孩子，衣食住行，柴米油鹽，一切要我們自己籌措，我這窮公務員微薄的收入，怎麽夠這一家的開支？於是便苦了你，胼手胝足，你每天作十九小時的苦工，晚上爲了小羊連五小時的睡眠也被奪去一半，我眼看得你一天天地瘦下來，我無法減少你的痛苦，這是怪我多讀了一些些中國迂闊的書本，使我一籌難展，不然也可經利用職權，找些「外快」；或是與人合夥，經營些買賣。同時却也怪你，不肯拋棄你那「世家子弟」而兼「文學士」的空銜，學一學右鄰左舍的新辦法，擺個香烟攤，買賣舊衣服。</p>
<p>我悔得很，不該讓你有孩子，我悔得很，更不該讓你到了重慶又有孩子，我尤其懊惱的在勝利突然降臨後，也像小學生地喜出望外，狂歡不已。所以我便不顧一切，輕舉妄動地飛來上海了，我以爲這就可以回家了，可以看見八年不見的老父母了；我又以爲你和兩個孩子也馬上可以來了，我的理想也不錯，我先在上海看看親戚朋友，寫信到家裏，讓家裏替我收抬一個讀書的房聞；收拾一塊讓小羊玩耎的草地；收拾一點爲大羊實騐的土木工具，等到你們來了，我們大小四個，便慢慢慢地踏着八年前離家的路，回去，親切地認着沿路的山水田野，牛羊草木回去，乃至接觸着沿路的風，太陽，月光回去。</p>
<p>再議我們在年老的父母前，痛痛快快地哭一頓，笑一頓，收拾我們八年分離的遣恨，結束我們八年顧沛的生涯，可是這畢克還在理想而不曾實現。尤其是你們，出讓了鄕間的草廬，出售了多餘的舊衣服，你們滿以爲可以坐到輪船，誰知道輪船多半給「帶金條約難民」坐去了，沒金條約難民坐不到，你們便在多事多霧的重慶市上困頓住了。</p>
<p>這是說，我們本來祗是分作兩作的，勝利了，我們却分做三處，老家，沒有了敵人，仍然回不去；你們，沒有金條，又下不來，我却懸排在中間，看不見父母，看不見妻子，我的勝利在那裏啊！</p>
<h3>犧牲</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>歷更的知</p>
<p>他們見到荆軻這樣姍姍米遲，都大呌罰他三杯。這麼說着，一大碗熱酒平已遞到荆軻手裏。荆軻一口把酒喝完了，便嘆着氣說：「秦國實在太覇道了，誰知道我們還有幾回這樣的痛飲呢？</p>
<p>狗屠魯莽地接着說道：「我們有酒就喝，有肉就吃，何苦長吁短嘆，說這些古古　怪的話！」</p>
<p>高漸離也就趕忙說：「這倒不能怪荆軻，秦國這樣強暴，我們無國遲早要吃它大虧的！」</p>
<p>「這話說得對！」荊軻說。「我荆軻決心以死報國、到必要時候，我決不憐惜這絛性命。」</p>
<p>說完這句話，荆軻又把第二碗酒一飲而盡了。高漸離和狗屠也默默地喝着酒，大家沉默了一會，姓高的也感嘆地說：</p>
<p>「怪不得我剛才走過中街，有一大羣書獃子也聚在那裏談「合縱」「連橫」。有的人說秦國出兵山東伐齊攻楚，燕國當然不能倖免，非趕緊想法「合縱」不可。有些人說約三晋聯合齊楚，再連同匈奴一起攻秦，才可以挽救於萬一。但是又有些人說「合縱這計劃曠日持久，現在韓王已經被虜，棄兵威脅着趙國的國都，我們惟有激勵士氣：將死報國。他們你一句我一句地爭論，鬧個不休。」</p>
<p>荆軻聽到這裏，把第三碗酒一口喝完了，一字一頓地說：</p>
<p>「將死報國—將死報國。」</p>
<p>高漸離跟狗屠不由得向荆軻看了一眼，荆軻的臉色是那麼激動，他睜大限睛，望着窗子外面黑暗的天空。</p>
<p>這時候有一個人走進酒店來，問老闆娘這兒是不是賣酒；那口音很生硬，不大像燕國人所說的話。荆軻看見他在旁邊一張桌子那裏坐下了，便欠着身子問道：</p>
<p>『將軍是不是從秦國來？』</p>
<p>那個人吃了一驚，可是立刻鎭靜地說：『我確是從秦國亡命到這裏來的，请問萍水相逢，那裏知通這些？』</p>
<p>荆軻笑着說：</p>
<p>『我聽說有一位樊於期將軍從秦國來，剛才聽得將軍是秦國口音，才這樣問問罷了。』相魯的狗屠沒有聽懂亡命兩個字是什麼意思，祗聽說是從秦國來，竟摩拳擦掌的要拔出刀子來了。高漸離急忙阻止他，低聲說道：『秦王殘暴無道，樊將軍是罪了秦王才逃到燕國來的。我們旣然痛恨秦王的強暴，那襄能加書樊將軍！』</p>
<p>高漸離這幾句低低的話，樊於期也聽得很淸楚；對於這種異國的同情，他深深地受到了感動。『一向聽得燕趙兩國，多的是慷慨悲　的志士，所以我寗可流浪到這兒來了。』他說。</p>
<p>荆軻跟高漸離覺得他爽直倜儻，就請他坐在一張桌子邊喝酒，高漸離又問他有沒有知道秦王正在重價購買他的頭顱？</p>
<p>樊於期長嘆一口氣慢慢說道：『當我渡過易水來到貴國的時候，我已經把我的頭顱獻給貴國人了。我一方面是知道燕趙多慷慨悲歌的志士，一方面又欽慕燕太子丹的賢明，才不揣冒昧的。果然太子丹把我收容，我今生感恩不盡了。』（未完）</p>

<h3>別荒蕪了藝壇</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>抗戰期中，力量表現得最薄弱的是我們美術工作者，如今，抗戰勝利了，各個部門都在嚷「復員」！而我們美術界確不聽見有人在喊「復員」！固然，復員一定在嘴吧裏喊賊了之，最要緊的，還在實事求是地去幹。</p>
<p>可是更奇怪了，勝利以後的上海，本來極度繁榮的美術市場也多消沉，而且將要停頓，如中國畫苑之類。展覽會幾成絕響，美術出版物總算辦了一個「藝術生活」周刋，某處出過一本「勝利版畫」，其他的報紙上，偶然可以發現一二篇評論美術的短文，別的好像是沒有了。</p>
<p>眞的，美術工作者大都爲了生活的煎灼而改業，展覽會爲着成本過大而無法開催，所谓美術運動便是無法展開了。</p>
<p>上海實在是中國新興美術的發祥地，至今還存在了一個歷史悠久的上海美專，以及他周圍的許多有力的美術工作看。我們只須回想，當年的「模特兒」問題，是一個披荆斬棘的事實，是從上海發動的，終於戰勝了封建的禮敎。現在，難通眞個不容易幹嗎？我想，聚集在上海的美振工作者，只要能够統一陣綫來展開工作，什麼美術展覽會，美術出版物，美術陳列館，芙術研究所，美術講座……隨便什麼理想都會慢慢實現。首先，我們希望上海的美術工作者站攏來，才得發生力量。</p>
<p>最後，希望大家不要忘記：「上海是中國新興美術的發祥地。」</p>

<h3>U.S. Earnestly Hopes Our Nation Can Eliminate Disputes and Achieve Unification, Laying the Foundation for World Peace and Prosperity</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] President Truman, two hours before Ambassador Marshall departed for China, issued a detailed statement elaborating on the United States' policy towards China. The President emphasized that the U.S. would continue to recognize the National Government as the sole legal government of China and hoped that the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could be resolved promptly. He also urged the swift convening of a conference of representatives from all parties and factions to study concrete measures for resolving the disputes. Furthermore, according to responsible sources, the President's statement implied that the U.S. was prepared to lend China a substantial sum of 200 million yuan, with terms no less favorable than those of British credit loans. In addition, the U.S. also planned to send thousands of technical personnel to assist China in its reconstruction efforts. It is expected that Ambassador Marshall will bring to Chongqing more concrete plans than those outlined in the President's statement.</p>
<h3>Truman's Statement: U.S. Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Washington, 15th (United Press) – U.S. President Truman today issued a statement on U.S. policy toward China. The full text is as follows: The U.S. Government believes that in this new and unexplored era, world peace and prosperity depend on the ability of sovereign nations to work together within the United Nations organization to achieve collective security. The U.S. Government firmly believes that a strong, unified, and democratic China is essential for the success of the United Nations organization and for world peace. A China disrupted by foreign aggression, as in the past by Japan, or by the chaos and division resulting from intense internal strife, will be a source of potential disruption to stability and peace in the world today and in the future. The principle long adhered to by the U.S. Government is that the handling of domestic affairs is the responsibility of the people of each sovereign nation. Events of this century have shown that the disruption of peace in any corner of the world is sufficient to threaten the peace of the entire world. Therefore, for the paramount interests of the United States and all United Nations, the Chinese people must not neglect the opportunity to reconcile domestic differences immediately through peaceful negotiation. The U.S. Government firmly believes that the most important things are: (1) The armies of the National Government of China and the Chinese Communist Party, as well as other armed forces holding divergent views, should find ways to stop military conflict in order to achieve the complete return of all of China to effective Chinese rule, including the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops. (2) A national conference with representatives from all major political elements should seek ways to resolve the current domestic disputes as soon as possible, that is, to promote a solution to unify our China.</p>
<h3>Assist Our Government in Disarming Japanese Troops, Advocate for a Consultative Conference of All Parties, Unify Military Command and Eliminate Independent Armies</h3>
<p>The United States and other United Nations have recognized the current National Government of China as the sole legal government within China. The National Government of China is the appropriate institution for achieving the goal of a unified China. The United States and the United Kingdom, based on the 1943 Cairo Declaration, and the Soviet Union, based on its participation in the Potsdam Declaration of July of this year and the Sino-Soviet Treaty and Agreements of August of this year, have all made pledges to assist China in its liberation, including the return of the Northeast to Chinese rule. All of the aforementioned agreements were concluded with the National Government of China. In order to continue the close cooperation with the National Government of China, which it had established in the past to carry out the war, and in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration and to eliminate the possibility of Japanese forces remaining in China, the United States is undertaking a definite obligation in disarming Japanese troops and removing them from China. Therefore, the United States has assisted the National Government in disarming and withdrawing Japanese troops in the recovered areas and will continue to do so. The U.S. Marine Corps is currently in North China for this reason. The United States currently and in the future recognizes the National Government of China and cooperates with the National Government of China in international matters, especially in eliminating Japanese forces within China. The United States firmly believes that in order to achieve this goal, a cessation of military conflict must be sought quickly. The support of the United States will not extend to U.S. military intervention to influence any Chinese civil war. The United States has been compelled to restore peace at a great price, which was first disrupted by Japan's invasion of the Northeast. Unless Japan's forces in China are thoroughly eliminated, and unless China becomes a unified, democratic, and prosperous nation, the peace of the Pacific will either become a bubble or may be disrupted. This is the purpose of the temporary stay of the U.S. Army and Navy in China. The United States is aware that the current National Government of China is a "one-party government" and believes that if the foundation of this government can be broadened to include other political elements in the country, it will promote China's peaceful unification and democratic reform. Therefore, the United States strongly advocates a national conference held by representatives of all major political elements in the country to discuss ways to ensure that these political elements can participate fairly and effectively in the National Government of China. To this end, the U.S. Government believes that the "one-party tutelage" established by Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, as a temporary measure in the process of national democracy, should be revised. The existence of independent armies, such as the Communist army, is contrary to China's political unity and, in reality, makes China's political unity impossible. When a broadly representative government is established, independent armies should be eliminated, and all armed forces within China should be effectively integrated into the Chinese National Army. Based on its repeatedly stated position on self-determination in the past, the U.S. Government believes that the detailed steps to achieve political unity should be determined by the Chinese people themselves, and any foreign government intervention in this matter is inappropriate. The U.S. Government deeply feels that China has a clear responsibility to other United Nations, that is, to stop armed conflict within its territory, as it threatens world stability and peace. This responsibility must be shared by the National Government and all political and military groups in China.</p>
<h3>Marshall May Arrive in Shanghai First</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Regarding the speculation about where U.S. Ambassador to China, Marshal Marshall, will arrive in China first, there are conflicting reports. The reporter has inquired with relevant U.S. authorities, who stated that no official confirmation has been received as of now. It is expected that Marshall may arrive in China around the 20th of this month. Reports from various sources state that he is expected to arrive in Chongqing on the 20th, but since many U.S. generals are concentrated in Shanghai, it seems very likely that Marshall will first come to Shanghai for a visit. Life Magazine has already assigned photographerラックス to cover the news of Marshall's arrival in China.</p>
<h3>U.S. Has Prepared Loans for Our Nation</h3>
<p>As China moves towards the path of peace and unity as described above, the United States is prepared to assist the National Government in every reasonable way in nation-building, improving its agricultural and industrial economy, and establishing its military system so that it can fulfill China's responsibility to maintain peace and order for itself and for the international community. To further the above-mentioned assistance, the United States will be prepared to give favorable consideration to China's request for credit and cash loans under reasonable terms to help China's plan to develop a sound national economic system and healthy Sino-American trade relations.</p>
<h3>National Government Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] National Government Telegram on the 16th: (1) The Executive Yuan's request to posthumously award the late officers Zhang Dafei and Long Zezhe the rank of Air Force Captain should be approved. This order. (2) Zhu Shaohuang, a technician in the Ministry of Health currently on probation, has another assignment. Zhu Shaohuang should be dismissed from his position. This order.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Address to Students of Major Middle Schools in Peiping at the Hall of Supreme Harmony</h3>
<p>Revolutionary youth, under the poisoning and oppression of the enemy and puppet regime, have struggled arduously and unyieldingly for the Three Principles of the People and the personality of the nation. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is a great comfort for me to meet my revolutionary youth in Peiping. This is not only the greatest comfort in my life but also the most memorable event in Chinese history. (Applause) However, countless youths have been killed and abused to death by the enemy and puppet regime during these eight years. Now that I have come to Peiping, I am unable to meet them. My grief is beyond words. I hope that my surviving youth will take on the responsibility, know shame and strive, work hard to strengthen themselves, and realize the Three Principles of the People to fulfill their unfulfilled aspirations. (Applause) Now that nation-building has begun, my youth must strive to be followers of the Premier and masters of the country. They must follow the instructions I will give below and put them into practice to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Promote National Spirit and Restore National Ethics</p>
<p>First, we must promote the national spirit and restore national ethics. Our Republic of China is a nation of etiquette, and our nation is one that values ethics. The spirit of its founding lies in the two words "loyalty" and "filial piety." All descendants of the Yellow Emperor should be loyal to the country and loyal to the cause, filial to the nation and filial to their parents. During our country's War of Resistance, we relied on the spirit of loyalty and filial piety of our compatriots to sacrifice themselves for righteousness and take life for righteousness, so we were able to turn defeat into victory and turn danger into safety. In the future, I hope that my youth will carry forward this spirit, obey orders, strictly abide by discipline, and, under the leadership of the government, build our China into a free and independent country. (Applause)</p>
<p>Read "China's Destiny" and Complete the Five Kinds of Construction</p>
<p>Read "China's Destiny" and complete the five kinds of construction. In my book "China's Destiny," I explained that China's construction must be based on ethics, psychology, politics, economics, and society. And these five kinds of construction require my revolutionary youth to be the backbone. Today, I am entrusting the responsibility of nation-building to my revolutionary youth. I hope that my youth will respect, cherish, stand on their own, and strengthen themselves to shoulder this important responsibility. (Applause)</p>
<p>Break Down Selfish Concepts and Cultivate a Spirit of Love</p>
<p>Third, we must break down the concept of selfishness and cultivate a spirit of love and unity. The shortcoming of our Chinese nation in the past lies in the fact that individuals have selfish hearts and lack a concept of the country and the nation. Therefore, it is like a heap of loose sand, inviting the enemy's aggression. In the future, to complete the great cause of nation-building, all of our compatriots must gather under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, love each other, unite as one, help each other, cooperate, and fight to the end in order to achieve our goals. Finally, I hope that my youth will understand the meaning of strengthening the nation must first strengthen the race, exercise their bodies, and pay attention to health, so that they are worthy of being upright descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and then they can undertake all difficult and arduous work. As for the suffering in your lives and the difficulties of the schools, I am always concerned and have instructed the educational authorities of Peiping to do their duty and strive to improve them. I hope that my youth will concentrate on their studies and work hard to improve themselves, so that they are worthy of being sound revolutionary cadres and fulfill your mission of implementing the cause of building the country.</p>
<h3>Chairman Will Inspect Nanking, Speech to Peiping Students in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, Two Myriad Youths Show Great Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 16th] Related sources said that the next inspection site of the Chairman may be Nanking and that it may be possible to leave around the 17th or 18th. Also, the Chairman's office announced that it had accepted petitions from the people. In the past few days, citizens have been enthusiastically posting letters designated for this purpose at the post office. Some have even traveled from Tientsin by car to post letters. As of 9:00 PM on the 15th, the mailbox outside Qianmen was filled with four large boxes, the post office at Xisi Pailou had two large boxes, and the other three locations each had one box, estimated to be about 10,000 letters in total.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 16th] (From Our Correspondent) There was a pleasant commotion in the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City today, as Chairman Chiang was enthusiastically surrounded by over two myriad young men and women. At 10:30 AM, after Chairman Chiang finished speaking, he stepped down from the Hall of Supreme Harmony amid thunderous cheers and applause. As he was amiably shaking hands with two young girls holding the school flag, over two myriad students immediately gathered around him like iron filings attracted to a magnet. The surrounding guards quickly pushed the Chairman back into the Hall, but he seemed to like the young boys and girls, and he immediately turned around and went down the Hall to comfort the children on the west side. This time, the children rushed up like a tide breaking through a dam, and in just a few minutes, they had surrounded the Chairman. Some of the more courageous ones went straight forward and shook hands with the Chairman. The atmosphere at the scene was chaotic and pleasant. The cheers of "Long live Chairman Chiang" rose and fell. All kinds of hats were thrown into the air. The guards managed to clear a path through the impenetrable crowd and helped the Chairman back to the Hall. Unexpectedly, the unsatisfied crowd followed, and the vast Hall of Supreme Harmony became a sea of black heads. Even the stone lions and bronze cranes were decorated with people. This pleasant commotion lasted for a full quarter of an hour. The Chairman was then escorted out of the venue by Chief of Staff Sun Yingzhong and General Dai Li. However, Chief of Staff Sun's foot was sprained by the enthusiastic children. General Dai's hat was covered with many beads of sweat. The children happily dispersed from the venue. Although many of them had their hats pulled off or their shoes stepped on today, those who had shaken hands with the Chairman were envied by their classmates. Today, the Chairman's speech lasted for 15 minutes. The Chairman was in military uniform, wearing a yellow-green wool cloak, and his face was radiant. He smiled amiably throughout the chaotic encirclement of the youth. Except for a few whiskers under his military hat, he did not look old at all.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 16th] Chairman Chiang summoned students from major middle schools in the city to give a speech in the Hall of Supreme Harmony at 10:00 AM on the 16th. Over eighteen thousand students from the city attended. The Chairman arrived at the Hall of Supreme Harmony at 9:50 AM, wearing a military uniform. He slowly ascended the platform, and all the students cheered and applauded for five minutes without stopping. The Chairman waved frequently in response and delivered a speech. After the speech, he reviewed the city again, and all the students were overjoyed. Some students even surged out of the ranks, as if wanting to pour out the mental oppression and pain of the past eight years to the Chairman. The Chairman was kind and compassionate, and he shook hands with the nearby students to show his comfort. (The original text of the Chairman's speech is in the lower right corner).</p>
<h3>Chairman and Madame Inspect U.S. Troops, Award Medals to More Than Twenty Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 16th] Chairman and Madame Chiang made their first public appearance today, inspecting the ranks of the U.S. Overseas Troops Fifth Regiment near the embassy district in Peiping and awarding medals to more than twenty officers and soldiers. The ceremony proceeded smoothly. When the Chairman and Madame drove to the parade ground, thousands of people were eager to catch a glimpse of them. The Chairman stood exposed in the strong north wind blowing from the Mongolian grassland. The wind was so strong that dust filled the sky and once blew off the helmet of a U.S. soldier. Madame Chiang and three Red Cross nurses took refuge in the car of Major General Lockett, Commander of U.S. Forces in North China.

The Chairman invited U.S. officers and soldiers to watch Peking Opera tonight.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 15th] (Delayed) Mo Teh-hui and Chiang Ching-kuo, accompanied by Jin Enxin, commander of the Fourteenth Air Force District, flew back to Changchun on the morning of the 15th.

<h3>Kunming Associated University and Yunnan University Still Awaiting Persuasion to Resume Classes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 16th] The student unrest in this city had already improved after Vice Minister of Education Zhu Jingnong arrived in Kunming to handle the situation. Professors from Associated University and Yunnan University had all agreed to resume classes on the 17th and had repeatedly persuaded students to resume classes. Chairman Lu had also summoned student representatives twice to explain the situation thoroughly. However, the Student Strike Committee was apparently controlled by more than twenty people who repeatedly changed their demands. For example, regarding the issue of the burial of deceased students, it was originally decided by faculty, staff, and student representatives to bury them in the school cemetery, and workers had already been hired. However, the Strike Committee demanded that they be reburied in Heilongtan and opposed the decided burial date. Furthermore, the Strike Committee spread propaganda externally, even using slogans to incite the people to "not pay taxes." Therefore, the resumption of classes on the 17th is still problematic, but the authorities and professors of each school are making every effort to persuade them.</p>

For the past three months, Wang has not taken off his clothes, his hair is three inches long, and he is dressed in farmer's attire, looking like a simpleton. His force of approximately 8,000 men has been fighting in southern Shandong for several years. On August 15th, after "Japan's surrender," Wang's force was already under siege by the Communist army for half a month. When the Japanese army withdrew from Linfen, Wang divided a portion of his troops to garrison Linfen City, which was then besieged by the Communist army for over a month. This unit perished entirely along with Linfen City. Subsequently, the Communist army continued to besiege Wang's base for more than three months. When Wang led his troops to break through the encirclement, there were still forty soldiers, but unfortunately, they were ambushed again by the Communist army on their way to Zaozhuang, resulting in heavy casualties. Currently, the remaining troops have reached the vicinity of Zaozhuang to rest and await orders, while Wang has come to Jinan alone to report. All sectors are preparing a grand welcome.</p>

<h3>Ringleader of the Invasion of China Meets Such an End: Konoe Commits Suicide by Poison Yesterday; Apparently Seeking to Avoid Exposing Secrets that Would Implicate the Emperor</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 16th, Urgent Telegram] Konoe Fumimaro committed suicide by poison at his private residence on Suganami-dori, Oginzato, on Saturday. The news has deeply impressed the Japanese people. Konoe was the number one ringleader in launching the war of aggression against China. He became deeply depressed after learning that MacArthur's headquarters had declared him a war criminal. According to a fifteen-year-old servant in his house, Konoe, after hearing that he was on the list of war criminals and that Yamashita Tomoyuki had been sentenced to hanging, drew several kinds of gallows on paper, expressing great fear of the pain of hanging. On the evening of the 15th, he committed suicide by taking poison. When the reporter rushed to Konoe's private residence at 5:30 PM this evening, US military police were already guarding the front door. About thirty United Nations reporters were crowded outside Konoe's bedroom. Konoe's wife, Chiyoko, and his son were weeping on the scene. It was reported that she had discussed with her husband last night how to manage family matters after he went to prison, and went to bed at 2:00 AM. She said that her husband's condition was normal at the time and there was nothing unusual. It was not until 5:00 AM this morning that she discovered that he had committed suicide by poisoning in his study, facing the inner garden. His son also interjected that when he discovered his father's suicide, he immediately called a doctor for emergency treatment, but it was too late, and he died at 9:15 AM this morning. Konoe's body is currently being guarded by US military police. When the reporter inspected his house, he saw that the walls of the room were covered with calligraphy scrolls, all handwritten by major Chinese traitors, such as Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that Konoe Fumimaro committed suicide by poison on Saturday night. Konoe was 54 years old, born into an aristocratic family, and served as Prime Minister of Japan three times. At the time of his death, he was still Minister without Portfolio and a member of the War Liquidation Committee. The deceased was Prime Minister shortly before the Pearl Harbor incident. Konoe was one of the main culprits in launching the war against China. Prime Minister Shidehara told a special correspondent of our agency: "Konoe's death was unexpected. I believe the deceased's intentions were sincere, but his policy leadership was flawed, so he has been criticized by the domestic people recently." Konoe's wife told a reporter from our agency that her husband met with his relatives and close friends on the last night before his death. His younger brother, Viscount Konoe, had just returned from the United States and also met with his brother that evening. His 22-year-old son talked with his father for a long time after the guests left, which was the last time he met Konoe.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 16th] According to well-informed sources in Japan, it was announced this afternoon that the reason for Konoe's suicide was to protect Emperor Hirohito. Because Konoe was to be tried for war crimes, he would be forced to reveal the internal secrets of Japan before Pearl Harbor, which would implicate the Emperor and expose his responsibility in this incident. Konoe's suicide by taking poison instead of seppuku was in accordance with the traditions of the Japanese aristocracy. It is said that if a Japanese aristocrat sheds blood in his residence, it will bring misfortune to the Emperor.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Yesterday, the entrance to Sugamo Prison was crowded with people who wanted to see the war criminals surrendering. The news of Konoe's suicide came as a great shock. After hearing about Konoe's suicide, US officials immediately declared that he had the right to commit suicide. Three tall American soldiers, barefoot in accordance with Japanese custom, guarded the small road leading to Konoe's suicide room. Japanese photography studios were allowed to take pictures, and US official photographers had already finished taking pictures.</p>
<h3>Death Note: Deep Remorse for Treacherous Policies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Before his suicide, Konoe wrote a death note in pencil. He handed it to his second son in his bedroom at around 1:00 AM this morning, and then went to bed at around 2:00 AM. He committed suicide by poison about three hours later. His suicide note stated: "Since the outbreak of the China Incident, I have often felt remorse for my improper handling of national affairs. However, if I were to be arrested and tried by the American court, such humiliation would be unbearable for me. I feel particularly responsible for the outcome of the China Incident. Therefore, I have made my best efforts to reach an understanding between the United States and Japan in order to resolve the China issue. I had hoped and tried to cooperate with the United States to solve the Pacific problem through peaceful means, but unexpectedly, I was listed as a war criminal, which is regrettable. My true intentions are understood by my friends, and there are not a few of these friends on the American side. Public opinion in this world is currently filled with excessive stimulation caused by the war, and it is inevitable that emotions will be used, and innocent people will be misunderstood, and malicious slander and unfounded rumors will be created. However, this kind of excitement will eventually subside, and the truth will be known."</p>
<h3>After Konoe's Suicide, Keenan Issues Statement: War Criminals Should Be Tried According to US Law; If Innocent, There is No Need to Feel Apprehensive; Emperor's Right-Hand Man, Kido, Imprisoned</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Following the suicide of former Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro out of fear of punishment, Keenan, the American Chief Prosecutor for Japanese war crimes trials, issued a statement to the Japanese people today, saying that if the Japanese are innocent, they do not need to fear American trials. Konoe was ordered to report to Sugamo Prison, but then committed suicide by poison. In fact, anyone suspected of being a war criminal and detained can rest assured unless they know they are guilty and are condemned by their conscience. We have repeatedly stated that the judgment of anyone's guilt must be done through legal procedures. The United States is an advanced civilized country, and its judicial system is known for its perfection and fairness. Those who commit suicide out of fear of punishment must be psychologically unsound, or they do not understand the American judiciary or misjudge it. [United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Kido Koichi, the "maker of the Konoe cabinet" whom Emperor Hirohito relied on as his right-hand man, surrendered to Sugamo Prison today with his secretary and a representative of the liaison office. He brought a suitcase and two packages of luggage. Kido did not comment on Konoe's suicide.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur's headquarters today issued an order to the Japanese government, ordering the Japanese side to hand over 69 suspected war criminals to Sugamo Prison for inspection within the shortest possible time. It is said that these 69 people had committed atrocities against Allied soldiers and civilians. According to Colonel Hardy, the American warden of Sugamo Prison, four war criminals had surrendered to the prison between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM this morning. They were Admiral Udotakao, Count Sakai Tadahiro, Viscount Okouchi Masatoshi, and Rear Admiral Oda Shigeo.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Will Temporarily Suspend the Arrest of Japanese War Criminals</h3>
<p>To Give Japan a Chance to Breathe</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th, Special Dispatch] Sources in authority report that MacArthur may soon re-examine the issue of Japanese war criminals. The purpose may be to temporarily suspend the arrest of high-ranking Japanese officials in political and economic circles. Since MacArthur ordered the arrest of war criminals two weeks ago, Japan's political and economic activities have almost come to a standstill. This afternoon, MacArthur again ordered the arrest of 69 Japanese who had violated international regulations while serving in prisoner-of-war camps during the war. Although Japan does not have an Allied military government, the current situation has made MacArthur's headquarters the de facto Allied government in Japan. It is believed that the temporary suspension of war criminal arrests will give Japan a chance to breathe so that the Japanese government and its political development can recover.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Orders Japan to Abolish National Religion System</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur yesterday ordered the abolition of the national religious system that the military had forced the people to accept.</p>
<p>Inflation Continues to Increase</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th, Special Dispatch] Japan's inflation has not only not been curbed, but has also increased in the past month and the first two weeks of this month. The daily issuance of yen banknotes means that the total amount of Bank of Japan banknotes in circulation has reached 49,168.8 million yen. Banking officials said that before mid-December, the Bank of Japan will have 50 billion yen in banknotes in circulation. By the end of the year, another 6 billion yen of banknotes will be added to circulation. The cause of the vicious inflation is the decrease in bank deposits and the large increase in withdrawals. This situation is due to the lack of household budgets and the black market.</p>
<p>Japanese Agree to Amend Constitution</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th, Special Dispatch] A national opinion survey conducted by Kyodo News Agency shows that the vast majority of respondents agree to amend the imperial constitution. The above is the result of summarizing surveys in 40 prefectures, excluding Tokyo Prefecture and three other prefectures. 75% of the respondents agreed to amend the constitution, only 30% advocated limiting the privileges of the royal family and expanding the power of parliament, and 25% agreed to abolish or amend the House of Peers.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Orders Japanese Government to Sever Relations with Vatican</h3>

<h3>United Nations Permanent Headquarters Decided to Be Located in the United States; Scope of Authority of the General Assembly Also Determined</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The United Nations Preparatory Commission yesterday passed a resolution by a two-thirds majority vote to locate the headquarters of the United Nations in the United States. Regarding the scope of authority of the General Assembly and the Security Council, fierce debate arose during Friday's debate, and a decision was finally made by the Eighth Technical Subcommittee yesterday. The point of contention was whether the General Assembly has the right to discuss the Preparatory Committee's recommendations regarding the methods, procedures, and agenda of the Security Council, or whether the Preparatory Committee's recommendations should be directly decided by the Security Council. The Eighth Technical Subcommittee yesterday voted 2 to 5 (with 6 abstentions), resolving to adopt Canada's proposal, deciding to amend the original text regarding the preliminary provisional agenda of the first General Assembly.</p>
<p>Economic and Social Council May Be Established Next Spring</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] The United Nations Preparatory Commission, recognizing the absolute urgency of dealing with post-war economic, social, and related issues as soon as possible, has decided to establish the Economic and Social Council in January or February next year. The Preparatory Commission's Technical Subcommittee C has now completed its work on the organization of the Economic and Social Council. According to the plan, the Economic and Social Council will hold its first regular session within 15 days after the General Assembly elects the 18 council members in January. The chief representative of India to the Technical Subcommittee C has drafted his proposals (including the organizational plan for the major committees under the Economic and Social Council), which will be submitted to the General Assembly for approval. According to the plan drafted by the Technical Subcommittee C, the Economic and Social Council will establish five major committees during its first regular session to review all the details of the most pressing social and economic issues facing the world. The five major committees to be established by the Economic and Social Council during its first regular session will be: (1) Human Rights Committee, (2) Economic and Employment Committee, (3) Temporary Social Committee, (4) Statistics Committee, and (5) Narcotics Committee. In addition, it has approved a recommendation to establish three other committees at the second regular session of the Council, but this will depend on the situation at the first regular session. These three committees are: (1) Social Statistics Committee, (2) Temporary Transportation and Communications Committee, and (3) Accounting Committee. Each committee will be organized jointly by government representatives and technical experts.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Although the United Nations Preparatory Commission has decided on the location of the United Nations headquarters, and its Economic and Social Working Group and the International League of Nations Working Group have also completed their tasks, there are still various complex problems that have not been resolved, which is disappointing. The work of the subcommittee on the Security Council is more advanced, but the progress of the committee on other general issues has been slower than expected due to its adherence to the principle of handling simple events first, delaying progress by a week.</p>

<h3>US Military Commentator Eliot Discusses the Current New Crisis in Japan, Says the Japanese Authorities Have Neither Repented Nor Implemented Democracy</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 15th: Major Eliot, a prominent American military commentator, wrote an article in the New York Times today, extensively discussing the current crisis in Japan and the Japanese government's delay in implementing democracy.</p>
<p>Eliot first stated: Before Japan's social problems are resolved, the parliament is merely wasting time. Japan has completely ignored the current social and economic crisis.</p>
<p>Currently, Japan has many fundamental issues, such as food, education, labor relations, democratic issues, private land ownership, financial difficulties, and the urgent need for a fair and humane political administration, all of which require immediate attention and resolution. However, the parliament only engages in empty talk and has no substantial discussions.</p>
<p>This situation is a typical response of Japan in a crisis. Recently, when the Japanese cabinet established a commission to investigate the causes of the defeat, it never mentioned the reasons why Japan went to war, the crimes of those responsible for causing the war, or the unforgivable lies spread by the military during the war. It only focused on why Japan was defeated, which is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The true meaning of this attitude is actually to research how to strengthen the country in preparation for another war.</p>
<p>Eliot further stated: The Japanese cabinet has never expressed remorse for the crimes of the Japanese military that disgraced the country. Eight years ago, the Japanese army's rape and murder in Nanjing, even when recalled by the Japanese themselves, is filled with shame and horror. Eight years later, the Japanese authorities still have not brought these inhuman rapes to justice.</p>
<p>Although some Japanese leaders cunningly claim to have democratic ideas, militarism and totalitarianism have clearly not died in Japan. The generals, the samurai spirit, and the businessmen who launched the war are still walking around with their heads held high, feeling proud of themselves. For example, General Minami recently denied to a Yomiuri Shimbun reporter that the military or the zaibatsu were the real criminals in this war. Japan's collapse should be blamed on the general public.</p>
<p>He said, "Tojo did his best, but the people could not meet his expectations."</p>
<p>This kind of argument, that the people could not satisfy the Emperor's demands, has been repeatedly stated by Japanese officials and is laughable.</p>
<p>However, after the US military occupied Japan, it has resolutely removed the factors that hinder peace and justice. The power of militarists and ultranationalists in Japan's social, political, and economic life has also been destroyed. The once powerful Japanese military leaders are in prison awaiting trial for war crimes, and some have already been judged by law. Japan's industry, agriculture, and national life have been completely cleansed of feudal remnants. Those who were familiar with Japan before the war will surely find that this country has undergone astonishing changes. However, all these changes have been caused by external pressure, and not by the Japanese side alone. Many changes theoretically accepted by the Japanese authorities are resisted by reactionary elements. In short, there are countless Japanese who oppose reform, but they still consider themselves democrats.</p>
<p>It is time to take positive action. A truly democratic new constitution should be decided by the Japanese people. A definite, practical, and clear plan should be announced to address Japan's current social crisis. Indeed, all Japanese politicians, even including the Emperor himself, must immediately stop all empty promises and meaningless guarantees, and must establish concrete and substantial proposals.</p>
<p>Only then can Japan move forward on the path of progress. Only then will the world believe that the beautiful words of the Japanese are truly powerful. Only then can the Japanese convince the world that Japan is qualified to be a member of modern civilized nations.</p>
<p>Eliot concluded: We must not assume that the occupying authorities can be responsible for implementing permanent reforms. Japan, which failed by listening to the words of bad leaders, should follow the wise words of true patriots. However, what Japan needs is not only this, Japan also needs an immediate reform plan.</p>

<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>The Riverbank Collapses, Urging Rescue</p>
<p>This county is located on the west bank of the Yangtze River. Before the incident, great importance was always attached to bank protection projects. However, the enemy puppets have never paid attention to it in the past eight years, resulting in serious damage to the riverbank and a very dangerous situation. In particular, the area from Yaogang in the east to Dexing Township, about 10,080 zhang long, the foot of the embankment is washed away by huge waves, and it collapses day by day. Among them, the embankment of the eighth bao, about 150 zhang, has collapsed more than half. The water level has risen sharply, and the river water will immediately flood in. Nearby villagers are guarding it day and night. The township office submitted a report to the first district chief, who forwarded it to the county government, calling for rescue. After receiving the report, County Chief Yang, together with District Chief Zhang and construction personnel, inspected the area on the afternoon of the 7th of this month, and then invited township bao chiefs and local people to discuss the active development of rescue work.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>The County Government Holds a Pacification Meeting</p>

<p>Planning to Build the Baimao Sluice Gate</p>
<p>The huge sluice gate at the Baimao Port is related to the water conservancy of the three counties of Su, Chang, and Kun. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the Central Water Conservancy Association allocated 300,000 yuan for construction. Kong Xiangxi personally attended the groundbreaking ceremony. After the war, no one managed it, and most of it was destroyed. The county government has recently appointed Huang Zichuan as the director of management and sent the recently organized water conservancy survey team to plan the reconstruction.</p>
<p>City Boxed Rice Establishes a Place for Public Sale</p>
<p>The local food industry has decided that during the military grain purchase period, in order to maintain the people's food supply, it will set up eight retail outlets from the 13th to sell rice at a flat price in the urban area, and stipulate that each person is limited to purchase five sheng, each sheng is 50 yuan, to limit consumption.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Coal Shortage is Severe, Requesting Relief</p>

<h3>China's Current Urgent Task: Establishing a Modern Transportation System</h3>
<p>— Original Article by Brig. Gen. George Olmstead</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. George Olmstead has served as the Chief of Staff of the US Army G-5 in the China Theater since January of this year. He is a major advisor to General Wedemeyer, participating in discussions on all political, economic, and crucial issues related to the US military in China. He is highly respected for his understanding of China. This article's content is insightful, and it is specially translated by this newspaper's editorial department for our readers. — Editor</p>
<p>American army personnel who have served in the mountainous and vast western China all unanimously agree that there are significant differences in outlook on life and lifestyles across various regions of China. For example, Yunnanese people differ greatly in clothing and living habits from Sichuanese, Hunanese, or Guizhou people. Even within a single province, there are significant variations.</p>
<p>To a casual observer, these differences in customs and languages, clothing, and manners might seem like the enchanting aspects of the East, but soon, he would realize that the causes of these cultural differences are signs of a serious underlying malady that must be quickly corrected if China is to realize its inherent national potential.</p>
<p>Economic Efforts Must Consider National Interests</p>
<p>A serious symptom is that one region cannot sell its surplus products to satisfy the needs of another. It's possible that famine is prevalent in one province while neighboring provinces have a surplus of food.</p>
<p>If we disregard the misery caused by isolation, it might seem best to let things take their natural course. Everyone knows that opening up highways, railways, and airlines to these remote areas would not yield immediate benefits because the region is too vast and the terrain too difficult. The vast majority of the local people live at the lowest level of subsistence, using only the most rudimentary tools to compete for survival.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the Chinese nation, it must clearly embark on a new era of economic, social, and political development. Agriculture is the sole means of livelihood for the vast majority of Chinese people, so it must be improved and developed. To achieve this goal, coastal commercial cities and manufacturing centers are extremely important. However, economic efforts in the coastal areas must aim at the benefit of the entire country.</p>
<p>Chinese Farmers Are Unable to Access Markets</p>
<p>I (the author) am from Iowa, a state that is also primarily engaged in agricultural production, so I am very interested in the various problems faced by Chinese farmers. In Iowa, transportation has developed to a degree that allows agriculture to be conducted on a scale similar to that of industry. Farmers can transport their crops to the market and sell them throughout the country and abroad. They receive cash, which they can use to buy manufactured goods, thereby increasing their comfort, productivity, and earning potential, while also reducing their labor. The cash income of American farmers, per capita, may not be as high as that of people in urban areas, but their standard of living and educational opportunities are probably better than those of farmers anywhere else in the world, and compared to Chinese farmers, the difference in all aspects is too great.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the reason for this difference in economic and social status is that Chinese farmers cannot access markets to sell their goods or purchase other commodities. The isolation that exists within China today prevents the attainment of a normal balance between the industrial and agricultural economies. Manufacturers on the coast find that their market is very narrow due to the lack of adequate transportation, while farmers not only cannot sell their produce at a fair price but also cannot obtain modern tools and equipment from manufacturers to enjoy the benefits of civilization.</p>
<p>The Fundamental Solution Requires a Modern Transportation System</p>
<p>Previously, like most Americans, I thought that China's most pressing need was an improved school system so that all people in the country could share the benefits of education. Now I know that this is only part of the problem. This is not to say that education is not valuable, but rather that it cannot be effective until it can penetrate isolated areas. Before transportation is improved, books and even teachers cannot reach students. At the same time, education is not very meaningful when production areas cannot access the market.</p>
<p>The conclusion seems very clear: the best way to solve China's economic and social ills is to establish a modern transportation system. However, several factors hinder its development. One of the main ones is extremely strong conservatism. In China, as in other countries, many people always like to maintain the status quo and are unwilling to improve. The main danger of this idea is that it often tends to develop into a habit. Although China still faces the threat of civil war and the various complex problems after the end of the war against Japan, for the sake of the country's future, it must prevent this conservatism from hindering progress.</p>
<p>Floods and Famines Are Not Inevitable</p>
<p>Another opposing view that I often hear people say is that floods, famines, poverty, and disease prevalent in China are considered necessary calamities, believing that without them, China would be overpopulated. This is not a new theory, but rather the doctrine of the 19th-century economist Malthus. In Europe, this doctrine is now only reserved for academic discussion. Due to the rapid advances in the work of physicians, engineers, and scientists, Western leaders and ordinary people have made their countries better places to live and work, and new horizons of life are repeatedly unfolding before them. This is not to say that everything has reached an ideal state; we still have to overcome war, racial persecution, outdated ideas, and disease. Although we still have several shortcomings, especially war, which seems to become more serious with progress, on the whole, the people of Europe and America can accept the gifts of modern civilization and enable everyone to enjoy more things than ever before in the world.</p>
<p>Developing China Should Start with the Big Picture</p>
<p>A third and even greater obstacle is that Chinese and foreign industrial and commercial leaders have failed to lead China to develop its position in the modern world. Restoring and developing China's transportation is not solely the responsibility of the government; highways, airlines, railways, telephones, radio, and domestic trade transportation issues must mostly be funded and operated by private individuals. Their private interests cannot be ignored, but they must focus on China's long-term future. If China does not have this kind of leadership, it is difficult to expect to occupy an important position in the ranks of modern nations. At the same time, if it develops its national strength in this area, then its industry and finance will be unable to surpass the pre-war position.</p>
<p>During the war, the United States' expenditure on highways and airfields, coupled with the plans planned by the Chinese government due to military needs, had opened up certain areas of China that previously relied only on primitive means of transportation. However, this contribution is only the beginning. There are very few highways in western China that have a road surface and can support the continuous traffic of large numbers of vehicles. Railways cannot fully exert their function as a transportation medium unless the current tracks and vehicles are substantially improved. Airplanes and radios, which are considered to solve all of China's transportation problems, also have limited functions.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Civilization Must Be Brought to the West</p>
<p>Shanghai and other coastal cities can be regarded as gateways to the outside world, centers for technological knowledge, credit loans, and enterprises. Only in such places can conceptual plans become reality. However, the civilization of the coastal areas, in the Western sense, is modern and must assume its own mission to bring the lessons learned from progress to the west. This does not mean that China's only solution is to impose the civilization of industrial technology on the ancient lifestyles of the agricultural provinces. In fact, these two cultures are bound to merge, and modern China will emerge with a distinctly Chinese character and philosophy.</p>
<p>Shanghai, like New York, is an international city, but it would be unfortunate if this international nature led it to mistakenly believe that it is not connected to other parts of China and has an independent meaning. This is inevitable to some extent; New York is also known for its remoteness from the problems of other parts of the country, but New York's financial and industrial technology has played an important role in the economic development of the United States. Shanghai occupies a similar position and has the same responsibility. If Shanghai's cultural life is international, then its economic life should be strictly national because Shanghai's happiness is inseparable from the happiness of the entire country.</p>
<p>Today's China Has a Great Future</p>
<p>It is very clear that China faces many problems that must be solved before it can make much progress. The current state of the national economy, the excessive inflation, the rising cost of living, the lack of consumption, the threat of civil war, and the chaotic political situation all urgently need to be resolved as soon as possible. However, despite these problems, China today is standing on a road with unlimited potential, and it is unprecedented in history.</p>
<p>For foreigners in China, the future is good. The Chinese government recognizes the value of foreign capital and specialized technology in developing a new China. The new China needs these things, but it must accept foreign capital and specialized technology like other countries, without special concessions or extraterritorial rights. This fact is commendable. If foreigners or foreign companies have goods to sell or services to offer that China needs, their citizens will certainly be welcomed. In my opinion, it seems that the opportunities for capital investment and individual enterprise can only be limited by the desire of capitalists to invest and the productive capacity of individuals. These are the two basic conditions of a free economy. Apart from this, we cannot expect China to go further.</p>
<p>America's confidence in China is the same as our confidence in developing the American West after the Civil War, and it is also the confidence that prompted the United States to support China in this war. I believe that this confidence will not diminish or lose its great significance in peacetime.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations in China: A Glimpse of the Jialing Guesthouse in Chongqing – Reported by Reuters Correspondent Campbell</h3>
<p>The brown three-story Jialing Guesthouse, located on a tree-covered slope overlooking the Jialing River, can only rank third in comfort compared to grand hotels such as the Waldorf in New York and the Dorchester in London, but its position in international diplomacy is as high as the latter, because the envoys of many countries are squeezed into its two suites and twenty-six bedrooms. Although only fitted with paper windows, bamboo ceilings, and straw mats, it has been used as the headquarters of foreign embassies and diplomatic missions for five years, such as Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Sweden, Poland, Norway, Iran, Portugal, and Belgium.</p>
<p>Travel magazines and travel guides call this place the "Magnificent Palace," the most modern and luxurious hotel in Chongqing.</p>
<p>The Jialing Guesthouse was built less than a year ago at a cost of 250,000 yuan to accommodate the constant stream of foreign guests passing through this wartime capital. "Adaptability" and "convenience" are not ideal. The thin walls allow Latin American and European countries to spy on each other's foreign policies or exchange sweet words.</p>
<p>The only disputes here arise from "antiques." The Brazilian ambassador attempted to open a museum in the embassy, ​​and he moved all kinds of bottles, Buddha statues, Tibetan ornaments, jade, prayer beads, prayer mats, etc., into his embassy, ​​which only had one bedroom, one living room, and one bathroom.</p>
<p>The staff in the hall often wandered into his suite to discuss the value of the nine hundred antiques in detail.</p>
<p>The Mexican ambassador lived in another large suite in the hotel; other ambassadors, counselors, secretaries, attachés, and other figures were squeezed into rooms that combined bedrooms and offices. The newly appointed Argentine ambassador had to make do in the small dining room downstairs!</p>
<p>The large number of rats and bedbugs in Chongqing were indeed annoying, but diplomats dealt with them in the same way as everyone else.</p>
<p>The Jialing Guesthouse was one of the happiest places in the capital. Every national holiday, every birthday or death anniversary of a national hero, could become an excuse for holding a "party." At that time, ambassadors would play the piano, play the guitar, tell fortunes, perform sugar-to-paper tricks, and they had no diplomatic restraint at all!</p>
<p>A dinner here is really a gathering of people from all over the world! The products in the kitchen are purely British, and diplomats can choose whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>Diplomats shuttled into the kitchen, hoping to cook a pure home-style dish.</p>
<p>The Jialing Guesthouse is run by a man surnamed Xu, who used to be a safe manufacturer in Shanghai. He knows the secrets of running a hotel: "The farther away you are, the better!"</p>
<h3>Konoe Fumimaro Dug His Own Grave</h3>
<p>Konoe Fumimaro, the "fair-faced prime minister" of Japan and the instigator of the war of aggression against China, finally committed suicide out of fear of punishment the night before last! The transmission of this message makes me feel both surprised and unsurprised. What is surprising is that, judging from his suicide note, on the one hand, he wanted to admit that he was responsible for this eight-year bloody war of aggression against China, but on the other hand, he tried to evade everything, (which shows that he did not wake up until his death and was still a thorough aggressor who was irresponsible. Konoe dug his own grave, and the history of the past eight years has provided iron-like evidence. The launch of the war of aggression against China was the first step in his project of digging his own grave, and Japan's surrender was the completion of the grave he dug. According to this statement, the scene of suicide out of fear of punishment is Konoe's last coffin nail. Now, after the coffin is closed, Konoe is the main war criminal who invaded China, but how can "one coffin cover his body" make "everything is over"?</p>
<p>The people of China and even the people of the world who love justice and peace have the right to demand that he be tried and severely punished, just as we have had the "whipping the corpse three hundred times" in our history. Because he killed himself out of fear of punishment, and at the same time, he killed tens of thousands of Chinese people for the sake of promoting the war of aggression against China, and even killed many Japanese people who did not want to fight. How can we let such a creator of disaster "end it all"?</p>
<p>Konoe was in power for a total of fifty-six years from his debut to his fall. He was born in 1891 and lost his father at the age of fourteen. He was raised by his father's friend Saionji, and later entered the Faculty of Law of the Imperial University of Tokyo. After three years, he followed Saionji to Paris to attend the peace conference. Having been influenced by what he saw and heard for a long time, he had already acquired Saionji's mantle. Since then, he has entered the Japanese "senior statesman" class and has been invited to join the cabinet several times, but he has always refused. After the February 26 Incident, Saionji recommended him to form a cabinet, but he was still able to "decline the great order," but at that time he organized associations such as the Toyo Association and the Nanyo Association, calling himself the "chairman." This period can be said to be the preparatory period for Konoe's war crimes of aggression against China. With the resignation of Hayashi Senjuro, Konoe's official career was satisfied under the conditions of reversing the so-called "Japanese crisis." As soon as he took office, he launched the "North China Incident," followed by the continuous entry of the Kwantung Army into the customs. He mobilized three divisions from Japan and dispatched more than 100 aircraft to attack Pingjin. On the one hand, he said that he would "not change the expansion policy," but on the other hand, he sent Japanese aircraft to fly all over our national airspace. In the process of developing the "Konoe Three Principles" and the "unchanging and non-expanding policy," the serious losses suffered by our country's civilians and soldiers are really uncountable. This period can be said to be the budding period of Konoe's aggression against China.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the wise and heroic Generalissimo Chiang, our authorities began to break Konoe's conspiracy to invade China, so Konoe had to change his tactics and put forward the so-called "Greater East Asia New Order" and "long-term war." This drama—the so-called "Konoe Statement"—was once again attacked by our authorities and was completely discredited. Konoe was so scared that he fled with his head in his hands and ended up resigning. This was the launch period of Konoe's aggression against China.</p>
<p>But Konoe was unwilling to step down. He saw that in June of the 29th year of the Republic of China, Germany had won in Europe, and Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France had all fallen into German hands. He believed that this was a good opportunity for him to make a comeback, so he speculated again and came out to form a cabinet. The so-called "Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Military Alliance" was the "greatest masterpiece" at that time. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, Matsuoka was dismissed, and Konoe's cabinet was reorganized for the second time, and the arrogance of the warlords became even more uncontrollable. After Hiranuma was assassinated, Konoe's third cabinet collapsed. In total, he formed cabinets three times from his debut to his resignation, always using the excuse of "doing his best to resolve the war" to secretly practice the reality of his false pretexts, so he made trouble again and again.</p>
<p>Japan formed the prelude to the war of aggression against China with Konoe's first cabinet, fell into international isolation with Konoe's second cabinet, and created the Pacific War with Konoe's third cabinet and Tojo's rise to power. A string of war crimes should be severely punished by the United Nations, and can never be ended by suicide. (Ya Nong)</p>
<p>……Konoe, whose crimes deserve death</p>
<h3>Tokyo Street Stalls</h3>
<p>The crimes of Japanese warlords are too numerous to mention. The United Nations used atomic bombs to inform them in order to save the Japanese people from suffering, and the dawn of peace began to appear. After Tokyo was bombed, Japanese civilians had nowhere to live and no ability to make a living. Street life was everywhere. The picture shows Tokyo merchants setting up street stalls on the sidewalk, and customers inspecting food on the ground.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Konoe's Suicide is Too Light a Punishment!</h3>
<p>—The Japanese People Should Redeem Their Past Sins—</p>
<p>A Tokyo dispatch yesterday reported that Konoe Fumimaro, the instigator of the invasion of China, committed suicide on the evening of the 15th out of fear of punishment. Konoe, a young nobleman, became prime minister with the title of "White-faced Prime Minister," considering himself extraordinary, and the Japanese people once placed considerable hope in him. However, during his three times forming a cabinet over eight years, he not only ignited the flames of a full-scale invasion of China but also initiated and directed the behind-the-scenes launching of the Pacific War. The unprecedented devastation suffered by humanity during World War II can be said to be a gift from Konoe. MacArthur naturally designated him as a war criminal and ordered his arrest. After Japan's surrender, Konoe also publicly stated that he should bear full responsibility for the war of aggression against China. Knowing that he could hardly escape punishment on the day he surrendered, he ended his life in despair. As the saying goes, "He who does much evil is sure to come to ruin." And, "You reap what you sow." Konoe's current situation is entirely the result of his own evil deeds; his suicide is entirely the result of his numerous acts of injustice, which are not worth discussing in detail. However, from the perspective of Japan and China, Konoe's suicide is still too light a punishment, and this remaining guilt must be redeemed by the efforts of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>It is not easy for a nation to rise and prosper; it is even more difficult for a country to build itself up. Japan, originally an island nation in the East, has for thousands of years been nurtured and protected by Chinese culture. Once it underwent reforms and innovations, striving for progress, it managed to join the ranks of powerful nations after fifty years of planning and management since the Meiji Restoration. The First World War gave it ample opportunities for development, and the situation in East Asia almost revolved around Japan's lead. Unfortunately, Japan at that time only paid lip service to benevolence, while in reality practicing hegemony, single-mindedly aiming to dominate Asia and unify the world.</p>
<p>When the Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen passed through Japan on his way north in 1925, he earnestly advised them repeatedly, but his words fell on deaf ears. It was not surprising that the warlords of the army and navy, and the young and reckless military men, went on a rampage. But why were there no insightful people among the elder statesmen, senior ministers, and aristocratic strategists who could turn the tide and protect the country's fate?</p>
<p>Since the February 26th Incident in Japan, when Prime Minister Okada was attacked by thugs, creating another political tragedy after the May 15th Incident, the arrogance of the military increased daily. Hirota Koki could not control them, and Hayashi Senjuro could do nothing. Konoe, who at the time had the hopes of the times on his shoulders and was also valued by Prince Saionji, was expected by all parties to serve as a bridge between the military and the political parties, thinking that Konoe could perhaps slightly restrain the madness of the warlords, much like the saying, "If this man does not come forth, what will become of the country?" If Konoe felt that he could not save the situation, why bother to seek trouble? But since he resolutely formed a cabinet, he should have understood how Japan should maintain its prosperity, how to be friendly and benevolent to its neighbors, and how to "untie the bell that tied it," returning the four northeastern provinces to China, repairing land relations, and opening the door to peace in East Asia. Instead, he did not pursue this path. Only a month after forming his cabinet, he launched the Lugouqiao Incident, unveiling the prelude to a full-scale invasion of China. From then on, Japan became more and more deeply mired in the war of aggression against China, unable to extricate itself, and even strengthened the war system, serving as a precursor to Tojo Hideki's launching of the Pacific War. Finally, the flames of war spread, the people were plunged into misery, and Japan had to surrender to the Allied forces. We think: a Japan that had been nurtured by Chinese culture for thousands of years, had diligently emulated Europe and America for decades, and had gradually become wealthy and powerful, dominating one side, in less than eight years, the achievements of the Meiji era were all washed away. How difficult success is, and how easy destruction is! Konoe had the opportunity to be effective and was in a position to be effective. Because he was intent on being perfunctory, pleasing everyone, pandering to the warlords, and instigating aggression, he brought about the disastrous consequences of destroying the country. Judging Konoe from Japan's perspective, with the coffin lid nailed down, isn't his suicide too light a punishment?</p>
<p>Furthermore, from China's perspective: after Konoe came to power, on the one hand, he used sweet words and honeyed phrases, hoping for "Sino-Japanese cooperation," and on the other hand, he used gunfire and bullets to massacre the Chinese people. Leaving aside everything else, just reading the description of the Nanjing Massacre eight years ago, written by our newspaper's special correspondent yesterday, the hellish life of rape and slaughter suffered by hundreds of thousands of men, women, old, and young, we will never forget Konoe's crime of initiating aggression, and we believe that the people of the world will never forgive the atrocities of the Japanese invaders. Matsui Iwane seemed to have said when he returned from China that he would shave his head and become a monk to show repentance. Can such a sin be settled with just one act of repentance?</p>
<p>Originally, China and Japan were countries with the same culture, and for thousands of years, when China was powerful, Japan did not perish. In the past hundred years, with the exchange of goods between China and foreign countries, and the emphasis on good faith and harmony, as long as Japan did not intensify its aggression, forcing China to become unable to survive, then even the shame of defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the humiliation of the Treaty of Shimonoseki could be improved through equal means, and economic cooperation, equality, and mutual benefit would be easier to achieve, given the contiguity of Chinese and Japanese territories. However, during Konoe's three terms as prime minister, Japan insisted on not taking this path, insisting on not admitting its mistakes, insisting on going all the way to the end, insisting on colluding with a few traitors and scoundrels, and taking the 400 million Chinese people as enemies, resulting in millions of bandit troops, like beasts, running wild everywhere in China, committing atrocities, murder, and robbery, creating a psychology among the Chinese people of hating the Japanese invaders to the bone. Although our National Government treats Japan with leniency, from the perspective of the people, the people who suffered the massacre and robbery of the Japanese invaders will never forget. The Japanese soldiers who can still ride horses on the streets today are the mad beasts who came to China to carry out the massacre under the orders of Konoe and his successors! As long as we see these beasts appearing on Chinese territory, we will never forget Konoe's crimes. In order to consolidate world peace and to ensure that an aggressive Japan does not reappear in the East, China must insist on severely punishing all war criminals, large and small, especially the war criminals who invaded China, and must destroy Japan's military regime so that the Japanese people can truly be cultivated in "human nature" through the re-education of loving peace and freedom. Reflecting on these efforts that we should make in the future, Konoe's debt to China is indeed too great even in death.</p>
<p>Looking further: Konoe's crimes are not only the result of his own evil deeds, but also the result of the Japanese people's own evil deeds; not only Konoe's numerous acts of injustice, but also the Japanese people's numerous acts of injustice. Only with such Japanese people could there be such a Japanese political system; only with such a Japanese political system could such Japanese political figures be produced. Therefore, Konoe's launching of the invasion of China and preparing for the world war can be seen as a representative of the mad behavior of the Japanese people. Perhaps we can severely condemn the Japanese warlords and forgive the Japanese people, thinking that the Japanese people were under the tyranny of the warlords and could do nothing. But why did the warlords emerge, why did they seize political power, why did they make Konoe unable to bow down and lower his head to breathe in the warlords' nostrils? We still cannot help but blame the Japanese people in the spirit of "Chunqiu demands perfection from the virtuous." Therefore, the Japanese people should know that from now on, they should do their best to be peaceful and kind people in order to redeem their past crimes of being tyrannical and domineering. As the saying goes, "Seek your own blessings." Considering Konoe's suicide, the Japanese people should not pity Konoe at all, nor should they forgive Konoe, nor should they think that Konoe's suicide was due to the coercion of the United Nations and complain about the United Nations. On the contrary, they should deeply realize that Konoe has failed Japan, failed China, and failed the world. Even death is not enough to cover his guilt, and the Japanese people should strive to correct their past mistakes, so as to redeem themselves in the future and seek their own future blessings.</p>
<h3>The Face of a Beast: A Casual Talk About Konoe</h3>
<p>Konoe Fumimaro's name contains the character "文" (Wen, meaning culture), but considering his entire history of invading China, he has indeed failed the "文" (culture). In other words, he was too "武" (Wu, meaning martial).</p>
<p>He usually loved to read literary works, attempting to use this as a mask to conceal his aggressive actions. However, the fox's tail was exposed; he favored low-brow literature, literature describing the lives of young men and women, literature of the type of Kikuchi Kan.</p>
<p>Konoe once pretended to be a journalist because, as a member of Saionji's entourage, he was not allowed to attend the Paris Peace Conference, so he fraudulently claimed to be a journalist to participate in it, and was later reprimanded by Saionji.</p>
<p>Once, at the wedding of Konoe's niece, a masquerade ball was held, and Konoe personally went to Asakusa to buy a fake beard and dressed up as Hitler's ghost to appear at the ball. They both ended up committing suicide, and some commentators said that this was "not without reason" and "not a coincidence."</p>
<p>Western newspapers jokingly called Konoe's repeated cabinet formations simply changing a "hat."</p>
<p>Now, Konoe has committed suicide out of fear of punishment. We feel that if he had changed his "brain" earlier, he might not have resorted to this "suicide" tactic! (Mu Sheng)</p>

<h3>Financial and Commercial Review of Last Week</h3>
<p>Finance: Last week, the daily interbank lending rate in Shanghai's financial market remained stable at 30 cents per thousand yuan. The secret lending rate in the Securities Building decreased from 12 cents to 8 cents due to limited demand for household expenses. This was even cheaper than the bank overdraft interest rate of 9 cents per month. Everyone was nervously watching the Supreme Economic Conference for direction regarding the new exchange rate with the US dollar. Initially, there were rumors that the US dollar could be pegged at 950 yuan to one, based on the fact that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was selling each 44-catty bag of US flour for 1,900 yuan in legal tender, and that the raw material, wheat, was priced at US$1.805 per bushel in the Chicago market. This was consistent with the government's policy of applying low exchange rates to daily necessities. Gold sellers were plentiful. On Tuesday, the price suddenly dropped to a new low of 583,000 yuan. Later, however, due to the fact that Standard-Vacuum and two other oil companies were selling gasoline for 400 yuan per gallon, while its cost was US$0.25, it was estimated that the US dollar should be pegged at 1,600 yuan. This was consistent with the government's policy of applying high exchange rates to luxury goods. The gold market's buying interest suddenly rose. On Friday, it peaked at 768,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 185,000 yuan compared to the low point. Finally, due to powerful entities selling gold and buying US dollars, it fell back to 730,000 yuan at closing, still up 47,000 yuan compared to the end of the previous week. The US dollar slightly followed the gold price, falling to 935 yuan. Gradually, because Chongqing was looking at a rate of 1,350 yuan for the US dollar, buyers were enthusiastic, and the peak reached 1,325 yuan. Afterwards, those with abundant funds and import-export businesses seized the opportunity to buy on dips, stabilizing at 1,220 yuan at closing, up 130 yuan, or more than 12%, compared to the previous week. There was demand for Hong Kong dollars and Cantonese currency, with old currency up 15 yuan and new currency up 4-5 yuan. There were sellers of silver, and silver shops were sluggish, with the price falling by 50 yuan per tael. Silver coins also fell slightly by 5 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Securities: Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew to Peiping, the political situation in North China has gradually become clearer. Banks and North China investors bought large quantities of unified bonds, especially Class C bonds. Sellers often could not deliver on the same day, and there were instances of being squeezed. It is reported that the total amount of unified public bonds issued in February 1936 was 146 million yuan, of which the actual amount of Class C bonds issued was 34,825,000 yuan. After deducting previous repayments, the remaining value is only worth about 500 bars of standard gold ten tael bars. In addition, the amount of bank holdings and wealthy investor locked holdings, the amount circulating on the market is limited. Every time there was a short squeeze, it would trigger a suspension of settlement. Last week, it closed at a peak of 600 yuan, up 60 yuan compared to the previous week. Among the Chinese stocks, due to the high gold price, large investors bought popular stocks, rising by 10-20 yuan. Due to the suspension of transfer of ownership of minor popular stocks, buyers were sparse, and they fell by 1-2 yuan. Foreign stocks were weak and fluctuated, with Jardine Matheson and Wheelock falling by 30-40 yuan each.</p>
<p>Commodities: Regarding commodities, the price of rice fell by 250-500 yuan compared to the previous week for both japonica and indica rice, due to the influx of Shanghai flour. Charitable organizations and hospitals have mostly switched to consuming rationed American flour, and local consumers are less interested in buying rice. Glutinous rice alone rose by 500 yuan. Due to UNRRA's first batch of American flour being sold for only 40 yuan per catty, or 1,760 yuan per bag, the Chinese flour industry was greatly suppressed, and sales were concentrated on American flour. The price of the top two grades of local flour continued to fall by 300-400 yuan. Currently, the flour mills are full of American wheat, and there is a trend towards even cheaper prices in the future. Among the miscellaneous grains, soybeans and corn sold averagely, falling by 200 yuan. Peanuts, needed by local confectioners, alone rose by 750 yuan, with large-grained Yangzhou goods being the most expensive at 11,750 yuan, and Bengbu goods being the cheapest at 8,500 yuan. Edible oil was affected by the frequent drops in soybean raw material prices. In addition, with the continuous arrival of goods from Qingdao, both raw oil and soybean oil fell by 2-3,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Due to the arrival of more than 1,000 dan of Taiwanese sugar in Shanghai, which is seeking a good price to sell, retail sales in the market were scattered. Xinghua red and white sugar each fell by 7,000 yuan, stabilizing at 40,000 yuan per 100 catties. Regarding textiles, raw cotton rose by 2,500 yuan due to the sales of coarse yarn and the manufacturers' purchase of "fire machine" cotton. The price of Nantong fine cotton remained stable at 40,000 yuan per load. Cotton yarn was needed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and local merchants and farmers in the suburbs purchased coarse yarn of 16 counts or less, with each bale rising by 30-50,000 yuan. Cotton cloth slightly followed the yarn market and the gold price, rising by 2,000 yuan. Twelve-pound white plain cloth alone rose by 4,500 yuan. Due to news of a resolution of the labor unrest at silk factories, the demand for silk increased. In addition, the first batch of exports has already been shipped, and sentiment has improved. High-grade factory silk rose by 10,000 yuan per load, while Huzhou silk alone rose by 35,000 yuan. Rayon also rose by 70,000 yuan, and silk fabrics and crepe also rose by 500-1,000 yuan each. As the foreign firms started to sell, and Suzhou and Wuxi both had purchases, tea rose by 2-4,000 yuan for both red and green tea. Regarding fuel, with the continuous arrival of domestic and foreign goods, the price of Standard-Vacuum Asia Petroleum's kerosene fell from 130 yuan to 100 yuan per catty. Small families have a tendency to switch to using kerosene stoves. Firewood fell sharply, with a large amount piled up along the Suzhou River. Pine firewood has fallen to 850 yuan per load, a sharp drop of 450 yuan compared to the previous week. The price of other white coal, small coal, lump coal, and coal dust also fell by 2-30,000 yuan per ton. Among daily necessities, soap was affected by the sharp drop in soda ash from 700,000 yuan in late November to 140,000 yuan this week. Stockpilers were eager to sell, and prices fell by 1-2 yuan each. Matches were stable. Due to large-scale purchases by Sichuan merchants, British brand cigarettes were the most popular, with each carton soaring by 165,000 yuan. Chinese cigarettes are also expected to be stable. The future trend of all commodities tends to be concentrated on the fluctuation of the US dollar. (Chong Bo)</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Grains of Bengbu</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Before Bengbu flourished, the distribution center for miscellaneous grains in northern Anhui was Huaiyuan. In the early years of the Republic, when Ni Sichong was the military governor of Anhui, he spared no effort in revitalizing the Bengbu market. He invested in the construction of ship locks to facilitate navigation. Grain ships from the upper reaches of the Huai River could directly reach Bengbu, and the grain market of Huaiyuan was transferred to Bengbu. Thus, Bengbu became a distribution center for miscellaneous grains in northern Anhui, with a history of only over twenty years.</p>
<p>Production Areas of Miscellaneous Grains: Various places along the upper and lower reaches of the Huai River are known for producing miscellaneous grains, especially Yingzhou, Haozhou, Guoyang, Mengcheng, Zhengyangguan, and Wuhe. The main miscellaneous grains produced are soybeans and wheat, followed by sorghum, mung beans, sesame, peanuts, barley, and adzuki bean cakes. The peak sales period for soybeans is October, and for wheat, it is June. Between June and October each year, merchants gather in Bengbu. The major purchasing merchants are from Shanghai, Wuxi, and Changzhou. Before the incident (likely referring to the Sino-Japanese War), Bengbu sold 6 million dan of soybeans and 8 million dan of wheat annually. During the period of enemy occupation, strict controls were imposed on miscellaneous grains, especially soybeans. Export was strictly prohibited without permission from the enemy military, so there are no accurate estimates of soybean and wheat production and sales during this period.</p>
<p>Grain Firm Organization: Before the incident, there were 54 grain firms in Bengbu. After the victory of the War of Resistance, commerce in the recovered areas flourished. Currently, there are over 100 grain firms in Bengbu. These grain firms also operate salt businesses. Northern Anhui's salt also uses Bengbu as a distribution center. The salt supply along the Huai River relies on Bengbu. When grain ships arrive, they load salt for the return trip after selling miscellaneous grains. Before the incident, Bengbu grain ships sold around 5,000 dan of salt each time. The characteristics of the grain firms here are: first, they also sell salt; second, they are divided into selling firms and buying firms. Selling firms are smaller in scale and only help grain ship owners sell their goods, charging commissions. Buying firms are larger in scale because they sometimes have to advance funds for customers. Larger and more developed grain firms include Rendai, Banzhong, Yuanfu, Changfeng, Yuanlong, and Xicheng. There is also a grain industry association among the firms.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grain Transportation and Sales: About a mile from Bengbu is a gathering place for grain ships called Xin Chuantang (New Ship Pond), which was created by former Anhui Governor Ni Sichong. On average, over 2,000 grain ships are moored there daily, with masts standing like a forest, bow to stern. Before Xin Chuantang was opened, grain ships could not directly dock at Bengbu Wharf. Since the opening of Xin Chuantang, it has been convenient for grain ships. The miscellaneous grains produced along the Huai River are loaded onto ships and transported to Bengbu. Some customers entrust ship owners to transport their goods, while others are purchased and transported by the ship owners themselves. After arriving at Xin Chuantang, the ship owners send samples directly to the selling firms. Selling and buying firms hire small boats in Xin Chuantang, each flying the flag of their respective firms. Every morning, the customers go to the boats of the firms they usually deal with. These firms are the buying firms. On the buying firm's boat, there are sample officers of the firm waiting. On the selling firm's boat, there are officers of the firm, who specially accompany the grain ship owners and the samples loaded on their ships to the buying firm's boats for sales. If the prices negotiated by both parties are close, the selling firm trusts the buying firm's customers to go to the grain ship to check the samples. After the samples are verified, the deal is finalized. At the time of finalizing the deal, no deposit is paid, relying entirely on the credibility of the buying firm. Sampling, inspection, and transactions all take place on the boats, which can be called "water transactions." Every morning, small boats shuttle back and forth, flags flutter, a bustling scene, truly a unique aspect of the market. Buying firms charge a guarantee deposit of two percent when buying goods for customers.</p>
<p>Measurement Organization: Another characteristic of Bengbu's grain trade is the measurement organization. The miscellaneous grains are packed in seven-dou (a unit of dry measure) bags in Bengbu. In terms of soybeans, seven dou here is equivalent to about 220 Shanghai market catties. The sale and purchase of miscellaneous grains in water transactions are all handled by the measurement organization. After the measurement procedures are completed, the measurement organization charges a certain fee, about a dozen yuan per bag currently. Therefore, Bengbu's grain trade involves not only selling and buying firms but also a measurement organization, which acts as a witness to the weighing. Furthermore, Bengbu's soybean sales are mainly for export, while wheat has a large market in the city. Bengbu has two major flour mills, Baodian and Xinfeng. Before the incident, Shixing Mill needed 1,100 bags of wheat every day, and Xinfeng, which was smaller in scale, needed about 600 bags a day. (Shan)</p>

<h3>The Voice of Students Across the City - Appealing to Commissioners Ye and Niu</h3>
<p>[City News] Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, the Shanghai Student Federation held a meeting of representatives from universities and middle schools across the city at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road. Present were Central Commissioners Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian, as well as over 80 representatives from Fudan University, St. John's University, Soochow University, Tongde Medical College, Furen Middle School, St. Francis Middle School, and other institutions. After the meeting began, Ye and Niu delivered speeches. Ye said, in essence: "Seeing you student representatives reminds me of the May Fourth Movement 25 years ago. At that time, Shanghai's base camp was Fudan University, and the command center was the Republican Daily. I experienced it firsthand. Recalling it now feels like returning to childhood.</p>
<p>Students as the Center</p>
<p>I have always believed that the cultural world is centered on education, and education is centered on students. The Shanghai student community should be centered on you. Therefore, I hope you will take responsibility for leading students across the city to jointly study knowledge and assist the government." Ye also mentioned the Kunming student unrest, saying, "The Kunming student unrest has subsided and classes have resumed as usual. If Shanghai still echoes the Kunming student unrest, it is a truly unwise action. I hope Shanghai will no longer engage in such passive and destructive work in the future. Today's government is not the government of the May Fourth era; today's government is a government of national salvation and revolution." Niu explained the importance of China's position from a historical and geographical perspective.</p>
<p>Shouldering China's Mission</p>
<p>He encouraged the students to shoulder China's mission and the world's mission. After Ye and Niu finished speaking, representatives from various schools eagerly spoke, summarizing their opinions as follows: (1) The association expressed its infinite concern for the Kunming student unrest, especially for the students who died, expressing infinite sympathy. It was decided to apply to the central government for punishment of the main culprits, investigate the truth of the incident, provide compensation to the families of the students who died, and send a telegram to the Southwest Associated University to express condolences to the families of the students who died. (2) The Shanghai student community is very concerned about the current situation and feels deeply indignant about the current internal strife and political corruption.</p>
<p>Requesting Thorough Reform</p>
<p>The demand for reform is too high, but generally, people can understand and sympathize with the difficulties and do not advocate passive strikes or meaningless parades. Instead, they advocate suggesting to the government to request thorough reform. (3) Increase loans and subsidies to help poor students in Shanghai. (4) Improve the treatment of teachers and staff. (5) Ask the education authorities to rectify the school buildings and school spirit, and hire more professors and increase library and equipment facilities. (6) Increase sports facilities to improve student health. (7) Ask the government to immediately organize military training. (8) Ask the government authorities to eliminate traitors in the education community and stop commercialized schools. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Teacher Qualification</h3>
<p>Giving Teachers Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Tianjin Air Mail] The Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau recently conducted talent registration and qualification of primary and secondary school teachers.

<h3>Chinese Engineering Students in the UK Sent to 36 Factories for Internships</h3>
<p>[British Information Service London 16th] Sixty Chinese engineering graduates came to the UK for internships last October. This internship program was arranged by the Federation of British Industries and the Chinese Ministry of Education. The sixty students have been assigned to thirty-six factories, from London and Bristol in the south to Glasgow in the north. They have settled down and are making a very good impression. In the past, ninety Chinese engineers have interned in British factories, and more than half of them have returned to China to engage in China's reconstruction and construction. Therefore, according to the plan of the Federation of British Industries, there are currently about one hundred Chinese engineers interning in British factories. In addition, there are many Chinese students studying in the UK with the assistance of the British Council and the China Committee of the University of London. The goals of the Federation of British Industries plan are twofold: (1) to provide Chinese engineering graduates with practical and thorough training to become excellent professional engineers and assist in China's reconstruction and construction; (2) to promote mutual understanding and social and cultural relations between China and Britain through two or more years of camaraderie.</p>
<h3>Go to the Countryside, Put Down the Peddler's Package, and Put on the Seed Bag</h3>
<p>50th Anniversary of the Founding of the American Agricultural School Recalling the Famous Words of the Great Russian Writer Tolstoy</p>
<p>[Associated Press New York 15th] Although the great Russian writer Tolstoy never set foot on American soil, an exclusive school dedicated to agriculture in the United States was established in accordance with his wishes. That is the American Agricultural School, located in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.</p>
<p>Tracing the history of the school's founding, we must first mention Dr. Krausoff, an American Jew from Philadelphia. In 1894, Dr. Krausoff visited Russia with a plan to relocate Jews persecuted around the world to uninhabited areas within Russia to reclaim wasteland and live by farming. At this time, Tsar Alexander III happened to be very ill, and Dr. Krausoff had no way to see the Tsar and present this proposal. Tolstoy, who had always advocated living in the countryside, heard this information and invited Dr. Krausoff to his home, where he listened to Dr. Krausoff's story under that "poor tree." Tolstoy used to listen to the complaints of poor and destitute people under this tree. Now, after listening to Dr. Krausoff's opinions, he criticized:</p>
<p>"Your ambition to lead your people back to the soil and return to the profession that your ancestors honorably engaged in in Palestine indeed gives me some encouragement, showing that the day is dawning and there is hope. This is the only solution to the Jewish question. Jews are persecuted everywhere and not allowed to own land or cultivate land, not allowed to join trade unions, and as a result, they have to rely on commerce to survive, but merchants are hated by the world. Making your people bread producers will earn the respect of the world. The plan for Jewish colonies, which wants to be implemented in Russia, now has little hope, but if this plan cannot be implemented in Russia, why can't it succeed in America? Lead your people to the countryside, to the rural areas, set up agricultural schools for them, teach them, throw away the yardstick, pick up the hoe, put down the peddler's package, and put on the seed bag. This will solve the problem that remains to be solved. In the future, you will see their land filled with milk and honey, just like before. They will supply the local people with the surplus, turning it into profit and the respect of others. Then many prophets, legislators, poets, and teachers will rise up among the Jewish farmers, praised and sung by the civilized world!"</p>
<p>Tolstoy's wish came true in 1896, because the American Agricultural School was founded in that year. The school's initial purpose was to educate young people in cities, especially Jewish youth, to receive agricultural training so that they could engage in farming after graduating. For fifty years, young people from major cities in the United States have come to study. In the beginning, there was only one school building and 122 acres of land. Now, it expands every year, including all aspects of agriculture, farm management, marketing, floriculture, horticulture, and other departments. There is no partisan color in the school, and the students are all young people between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one. Living together, working together in the fields, reading together in the classroom, and playing together on the grass, it is truly a scene of innocence!</p>
<h3>Scholarship Basketball Charity Game - Osina's Brilliant Shots - Chinese Alliance Team Defeated After Fierce Fighting - Chinese Youth Team Lost to US Sea Bees - Two Final Battles Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>The scholarship basketball charity game co-sponsored by this newspaper and Tongde Medical College held its second night last night. The competition between the Chinese and American champions was wonderful. Although there was light rain, the fans were still crowded, and the situation was even more enthusiastic than the first night. As a result, the Chinese Alliance was defeated by Osina by only three points, 43 to 40, after a fierce competition. In the first half, the Osina team took the lead with 24 to 19. In the Chinese Youth vs. Sea Bees game, the Chinese Youth lost 20 to 31.</p>
<p>From Prosperity to Decline - Chinese Youth Defeated: The Chinese Youth vs. US Sea Bees first appeared. The referees were Yu Julu and Xuan He. When the silver whistle sounded, the great battle began. The US team's tactics were clever, and the Chinese Youth was also very cautious. The competition was extremely fierce. In the first half, the Chinese Youth took the lead by one point with 10 to 9. In the second half, the Chinese Youth, having fought hard for days, inevitably showed signs of exhaustion. The US Sea Bees took the opportunity to advance and scored four consecutive goals, taking the lead with 18 to 10. The Chinese Youth then used a wheel-substitution tactic, frequently changing players. He Jingui's luck came, and he scored four points, gradually getting closer, but the US military became braver and braver. The Chinese Youth was no match for them and had no choice. The US Sea Bees defeated the Chinese Youth with 31 to 10. The US Sea Bees' left forward, Mitchell, scored the most points and was fearsomely agile.</p>
<p>Chinese Alliance Takes the Lead - Difficult to Separate: The game between the US military champion team Osina and the Chinese Alliance began next, and the audience's spirits were refreshed. The referees were Liang Zhaoan and Chen Liang. The game unfolded after the ball was thrown by Mr. Wang Xiaolai. The Chinese Alliance's Bo Tuo and Chen Xuesong scored consecutively, getting two goals first, but the Osina team quickly caught up 4-4, 6-6, 8-8, 10-10, 12-12. The game became deadlocked, difficult to separate. The atmosphere on the court was extremely tense. The Chinese Alliance always took the lead, and the fans were very excited. The US military scored continuously, and the situation changed dramatically.</p>
<p>The US military urgently sought to break the deadlock, changed their strategy, and indeed achieved a perfect result, scoring ten consecutive points, and the situation changed dramatically. The Chinese Alliance urgently called a timeout and rearranged their lineup. Li Zhenzhong's most wonderful passing, like butterflies fluttering, fully displayed his ball skills, and gradually caught up. In the first half, Osina had 24 points, and the Chinese Alliance had 19 points.</p>
<p>Every Shot Hits - Chinese Alliance Fights Hard:</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Osina's momentum was still strong, shooting with one hand, almost every shot hitting, amazing to watch. The US military then took the lead, taking the lead with 34 to 23 in an instant. Although under heavy pressure, the Chinese Alliance continued to fight hard, adopting long-range shots, which were quite successful. However, the difference between the scores remained the same, although they were getting closer and closer, but the time was limited, and Osina defeated the Chinese Alliance with 43 to 40.</p>
<p>Tomorrow Night's Second Victory - The Last Two Games:</p>
<p>Tomorrow (18th) from 7:30 PM, is the last two games, still held at the original location.

<h3>National Fudan University's College of Agriculture</h3>
<p>— Ji Yingchou</p>
<p>Since Fudan University moved westward to Beibei, the cultural center of the rear area, it has been renamed National Fudan University. It now has six colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, Engineering, Agriculture, Commerce, and Law. There are over four thousand professors and students. Located between Huangjueshu and Dongyang Towns on the north bank of the Jialing River, it has naturally become a university town. A long, neat row of tung trees along the river embellishes the university town, making it even more beautiful.</p>
<p>This is a field of more than four hundred mu, backed by mountains and facing the water. Although there are no majestic school buildings, rows upon rows of Fudan's simple houses, interspersed with fences and small bridges, are simple and unadorned, yet they appear solemn and serene, exuding a tranquility unique to the countryside, truly a good environment for studying. The campus is lush with flowers and trees everywhere, with different scenery in each season. One can imagine the endless joy for the numerous students.</p>
<p>With this advantageous "geography," Fudan University is doing its best to develop its College of Agriculture. University students study in classrooms and practice in the fields. Knowledge and experience are mutually verified, cultivating well-educated modern farmers who will become a vital force supporting the country's industrialization.</p>
<p>They are busy cultivating silkworms, planting and roasting tea leaves, and have achieved great results. What is particularly commendable is the chemically produced "Fudan Soy Sauce," available in both white and black varieties. The taste is extremely delicious. The people of Beibei all praise it, and even those dozens of kilometers away have heard of it and are vying to buy it, so much so that supply cannot meet demand. Even the faculty and staff at the school can only purchase it under a "rationing system." In addition, there are considerable facilities for fish ponds, milk farms, chicken farms, etc. Given time, the future of Fudan University's College of Agriculture is truly limitless!</p>

<h3>Higher Court Takes Strict Precautions: Traitor Cases Tried in Prison; Detention Center Attached to Shanghai Prison; Criminal Court and Prosecutor's Office to Centralize Operations Starting Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter visited Xiang Zhejun, Chief Prosecutor of the Higher Court, to inquire about the latest situation in the investigation of traitor cases. According to him, in order to facilitate the handling of traitor cases and to ensure the security of traitor prisoners, it has been decided that a temporary prosecutor's office will be established in Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison starting today. Designated prosecutors and clerks will be stationed there to work. Previously, the Higher Court and the District Court Prosecutor's Office conducted interrogations in the courthouse in the French Concession and sent prisoners to the Masnan Road Detention Center. If indicted, the prisoners had to be transferred to the Higher Court on North Zhejiang Road for trial. The separation of the court and the temporary detention center made it difficult to detain traitors. To coordinate efforts, this office has also decided to set up a temporary office in the prison and has notified military and police agencies that traitor prisoners, case files, and evidence should be delivered to the Tilanqiao temporary prosecutor's office for processing. Note by this reporter: Traitor cases, except those involving former military personnel who served in puppet military positions, which are handled by military tribunals, should all be sent to the Higher Prosecutor's Office for investigation. It is also heard that all major traitors arrested in the city will be transferred to the Higher Prosecutor's Office for investigation shortly.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Postal Service Between Tianjin and Shanghai: Establishment of Courier Team</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Shanghai Post Office, due to the damage to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in two sections, one above Xuzhou and one above Bengbu, mail from Shanghai to Tianjin cannot be delivered directly by rail. To maintain postal service, the Post Office has dispatched Inspector Feng to Xuzhou to organize a land-based courier service. Where the railway tracks are damaged, human porters will carry the mail to compensate for the shortcomings of train transfers. According to Inspector Feng's report, the land-based courier team has been organized and is ready. Postal service between Shanghai and North China is now unimpeded. For the Huai area, mail is limited to lightweight items; parcels and heavy items should not be sent for the time being.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed French Ambassador to China, M. Meyrier, to Arrive in China</h3>
<p>The newly appointed French Ambassador to China, M. Meyrier, is on his way to China and is expected to arrive in Chongqing around the 20th to assume his post, meet with Chairman Chiang, and present his credentials. It is understood that negotiations between China and France on the revision of treaties will actively commence after Ambassador Meyrier takes office. The Vietnam issue will also be discussed further based on the points raised by our side.</p>
<h3>Uniform Regulations for Shipping Fares and Ticket Prices to Take Effect on New Year's Day; Shipping Association Requests Allocation of Fuel</h3>
<p>After the victory, our government is extremely concerned about the resumption of navigation on various routes. However, due to the lack of fuel, the routes are not smooth, operating intermittently and with unreliable schedules. A Fuel Management Committee has been established to manage and allocate fuel. All imported coal is under the committee's management. However, some privately-owned shipping companies have not been allocated fuel, forcing them to purchase fuel on the black market. Black market coal costs around 100,000 yuan per ton, while the official price is only 24,000 yuan per ton, a difference of more than four times. Therefore, in order to maintain their capital, shipping companies have increased freight rates and ticket prices on their own, which has affected travelers, hindered the circulation of local products, and indirectly increased prices. This situation is of great concern. Shipping companies have repeatedly complained to the Shipping Association. The Association has confirmed that the biggest blow to the shipping industry is the lack of fuel. After repeated meetings, it was decided to submit a request to the Director of Navigation and the Municipal Bureau of Navigation, as well as the Fuel Management Committee, to find ways to remedy the situation, and to list seven matters that should be given priority in fuel allocation. Regarding passenger ticket prices and freight rates, which in the past were set by each company individually and varied, the Ministry of Communications recently instructed the Municipal Bureau of Navigation to unify prices. The Bureau has transferred this to the Shipping Association for rectification. The Director of the Bureau of Navigation, Li Gufan, the Secretary of the Association, Li Yunliang, and the Chairman of the Association's Rate Committee, Hu Shiyuan, have held several meetings and solicited opinions from members. It has been decided that starting on New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), freight rates and ticket prices must not be increased or decreased arbitrarily, in order to standardize them. The prices are currently being finalized and will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>District Offices to Be Established by Deadline</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has divided the city into thirty-three districts for the purpose of reorganizing the Baojia system and establishing district offices. The jurisdictions of each district have also been re-designated by the municipal authorities into two levels, A and B. The establishment of district offices is mandated to be completed by the 25th of this month, in order to begin the census. The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau will soon convene a joint meeting of all district chiefs to prepare for all proceedings.</p>
<h3>Over One Hundred Cases of Concealing Enemy Assets Accepted</h3>
<p>Regarding the reporting of concealed enemy assets, the Central Trust Bureau has announced that, as of last month, it has accepted over one hundred and twenty cases.

The Bureau will allocate perishable items to the Jianghai Customs for auction in the short term. All other machinery, grains, fabrics, etc., will be categorized and stored in the Bureau's warehouse, pending a decision on how to dispose of them after reporting to the Enemy Assets Management Bureau.</p>

According to the official announcement by the French authorities, "As of today, the French Consulate General has no knowledge of the charges against Chalais." It also stated: France has given due punishment, and if there are allegations against its citizens, the French government does not intend to evade responsibility.</p>
<h3>Garrison Command Establishes Telecommunications Inspection Section to Inspect Radio Stations and Register Radios</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command has received an order from the Military Affairs Commission to move the former Kunming Area Telecommunications Inspection Section to Shanghai and rename it the Shanghai Area Telecommunications Inspection Section, under the jurisdiction of the Garrison Command. The Garrison Command has actively deployed and established the section, and promulgated three sets of regulations: Regulations for the Inspection of Radio Stations, Regulations for the Management of Radio Materials, and Regulations for the Management of Radio Receivers. It is stipulated that all radio stations previously approved by the Ministry of Communications or the Military and Political Department must apply for registration with the section before they can continue to transmit and receive messages. In addition, merchants dealing in radio materials must also apply for registration in accordance with the law, and can continue to operate only after passing the inspection by the section. Civilians who wish to purchase radio materials must first obtain a purchase permit from the section, and then purchase from the merchant with the permit. All radio receiver users in the city must register with the section before the end of this month, and can only listen after passing the inspection.</p>
<h3>Families of Victims of Minlian Ship Shooting Request Compensation</h3>
<p>In the case of the Minlian ship accidentally injuring Jin Yunkai, the executive officer of the Yong'an warship, near Zhenjiang on its way from Chongqing to Shanghai, resulting in his death, because the military police on board who fired the gun and the deceased were both military personnel, the case has been submitted to the National Shipping Allocation Committee for handling and mediation.

<h3>After Receiving the Lingdong Iron Factory, Stationed Staff Members Attacked; Hu Lishan Injured, Gao Qihong Missing</h3>
<p>(This newspaper report) The Japanese-owned Lingdong Iron Factory, located near Gongping Road and Yuezhou Road, which was taken over by the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang some time ago, had two stationed staff members, Hu Lishan and Gao Qihong, guarding it. The other day (the 14th), Hu's nephew, Che Yannian, went to the factory to visit, and saw that the room was closed. Thinking they were out on business, he did not suspect anything. The next day, he went again, and it was still the same. He knocked on the door several times, but there was no response. He felt strange. After a while, he saw Hu open the door with bloodstains on his clothes and two injuries to his head. Before he could speak, he fainted to the ground. He hired a car to take him to Hudong Hospital for treatment, and it is heard that the injury is very severe. He immediately reported to the police for investigation. At the same time, Gao Qihong is missing, and his whereabouts are unknown. According to what this reporter learned afterwards, a villain had gone to persuade them to collude in stealing and selling iron materials, but failed, resulting in the attack. The military and police agencies have launched an investigation and are pursuing the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>US Military Supplies Flood the Market</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of the US military in Shanghai, a large number of supplies have been coming in, and at the same time, a black market has emerged. Tax-free cigarettes, beer, chocolate, canned food, etc., can be seen everywhere. US soldiers spend only eight US cents for a pack of cigarettes, while American cigarettes on the black market cost more than 500 yuan in national currency. As Christmas approaches, US military supplies have increased compared to before, and the black market is becoming more prosperous. The reason is that US enlisted men earn about 50 US dollars per month. Although the military provides them with clothing and food, Shanghai's dance halls and entertainment venues are places where people spend money like water. Many US soldiers spend as much as possible after receiving their salaries, and are penniless in a few days, so they have to sell their military supplies to compensate for their economic difficulties. The American people have the slogan "Army First" and often save materials as much as possible to supply their overseas troops.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of Hotel Tips is Being Negotiated</h3>
<p>Hotels in this city have a so-called "small tip" and "tiny tip". The municipal authorities believe that this evil practice violates the New Life Movement and should be banned. Therefore, they are discussing with responsible persons from the Hotel Industry Association. The result is that tea servers in each hotel should be given a reasonable and sustainable wage by the hotel, and all "small tips" and "tiny tips" should be cancelled. It is heard that this measure will be implemented on a scheduled basis.</p>
<h3>US Military Vehicle Hits Pedestrians</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] At the intersection of Zhongzheng Road and Lianyun Road, at approximately 7:13 PM last night, a US military truck sped past and knocked down four pedestrians. Qu Qiangxing was injured in the face, Xu Taolan was injured in both hands, a foreign man named Helen was injured internally, and a middle-aged woman named Yan Shuhe, who was riding in a rickshaw, was injured in the face. Afterwards, they were taken to Gongji Hospital for treatment by a US ambulance.</p>
<h3>Leprosarium Appeals for Assistance</h3>
<p>Since suffering a fire, the Shanghai Leprosarium has been actively working and appealing to all sectors for assistance. The British Red Cross has donated a large number of food and medicines.

Now, the prices of pork and beef are pending determination and will also be sold at discounted prices. Also, the Bureau previously set the price of sugar to be sold at a discounted price at 500 yuan per catty, but now, due to falling prices, it has been decided to adjust the price to 300 yuan per catty.</p>

<h3>Restoring Brightness: Restoring Streetlights in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>During the enemy and puppet era, the streetlights in this city were all converted to five candlepower due to lighting control, and anti-aircraft shields were added. Other traffic lights, platform lights, dock lights, and park lights were all demolished, so the nights were extremely dark. Since the liberation of this city, the authorities have found ways to replace light bulbs and gradually renovate them. The roads have been greatly illuminated. However, the streetlights in some urban areas, such as Chifeng, Zhabei, etc., were too severely damaged at the time, and it is currently impossible to fully restore them immediately due to limited resources and manpower. The Public Utilities Bureau is currently restoring more than 350 lights in the areas of Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Heping Road Ninghe Road, Penglai Road and Fangbang Road, and it is scheduled to install them successively on other important roads within the lunar year to facilitate the citizens.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Japanese Prisoner of War Camp - Hoping They Reflect and Awaken - The "Flower Garden Unit" Were All Very Happy</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Third Military Region's Shanghai-Nanjing Prisoner of War Administration Office hosted a tea party for Chinese and foreign journalists in the city. Director Wang Guanghan reported on the office's work and accompanied the journalists on a tour of three concentration camps, one of which housed female military personnel, the so-called "Flower Garden Unit." Perhaps some people think we treat prisoners of war, especially Japanese prisoners, too leniently. But based on the principles of "repaying malice with virtue" and "honoring the Way and valuing righteousness," we don't think it's worth it to beat a defeated dog in the water. Now, we should provide them with an opportunity to reflect and realize their past mistakes, hoping that after returning home, they will re-recognize China and establish a new democratic Japan.</p>
<p>The first place we visited was the Jiangwan Sixteenth Concentration Camp, which was previously the arrogant Thirteenth Army's Denglong Unit in Shanghai, numbering 2,400 people. Lieutenant General Matsui Takuhiko was in charge. There, we heard a report from Captain Kasai about the concentration situation in the Shanghai area and the conditions of service, education, and hygiene. He said that there were currently 70,000 officers and soldiers concentrated in forty concentration camps in Jiangwan and Wusong, all under the command of the administration office. Recently, regarding service, they are divided into groups to repair roads and railways. Education focuses on instilling new ideas and improving agriculture, supplemented by Chinese and English. In terms of hygiene, cholera broke out this summer, resulting in 300 deaths, but it has recently been eradicated. When reporters asked about their impressions of China's preferential treatment, Chief of Staff Doi said: "Officers and soldiers, both high and low, are very grateful. From now on, we will deeply reflect and thoroughly correct our past mistakes."</p>
<p>The second place we visited was the Wusong Second Concentration Camp, headed by Major General Nashioka, with 1,800 people. Their barracks were temporarily built by themselves, and the officers and soldiers lived in relatively simple conditions, with approximately twelve people in each room. According to Nashioka, they lacked knowledge and had very few books, only one type of "Reformed Daily News," and they hoped to have more "spiritual food."</p>
<p>Finally, we visited the "Flower Garden Unit," a unit entirely composed of female military personnel. They were recruited by the Japanese domestic headquarters, numbering 1,075 people, aged from fifteen to twenty-four. Their duties were limited to typing, switchboard operation, secretarial work, and nursing in the military. These days, they are practicing shorthand. When Director Wang gave a speech, everyone's faces showed great happiness.</p>
<p>Because there was a planned symposium at the Sixteenth Concentration Camp, we rushed there. At the symposium, everyone frankly raised questions and discussed them until 6 o'clock before dispersing.</p>
<p>These Japanese girls were all recruited, the so-called "Flower Garden Unit." They stood and listened quietly to Director Wang Guanghan's speech, feeling happy, and also feeling that the war had brought them emptiness, cruelty, and was a gift from the Japanese militarists.</p>
<h3>American Female Soldiers in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Mai Tian</p>
<p>At the desolate intersection of Julu Road and Gubart Road, a large, old-fashioned Western-style building stands quietly. An American military police officer stands at the gate, looking very lonely. This used to be the staff dormitory of the Yokohama Specie Bank, but now it has become the residence of the U.S. Army Women's Army Corps (formerly the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps) members in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The reporter specially went to interview Captain Harmon, the commander of the women's corps. Faintly hearing the melodious sound of the piano, and then proceeding to the living room, one felt a sense of peace and comfort. About a dozen members were seen, some wearing skirts, some wearing trousers; some standing and smoking, some sitting on the carpet sewing clothes, some lying on the sofa; and some sitting on the sofa with their knees bent, writing letters. Everyone was talking in low voices, and only one young lady was playing "Sweetheart." This warm and relaxed atmosphere was truly enviable. Later, I learned that this group of them were lucky people, preparing to board a ship to return home, so they did not have to work.</p>
<p>Just as I walked into their office, Captain Harmon called to say that she couldn't get there right away because she didn't have a car. Fortunately, I didn't have to talk to her personally, so Staff Sergeant Belys led me to visit the various places. It is said that there are currently sixty-two female corps members in Shanghai, of whom twenty-eight will be leaving here to go home soon, but soon about fifty new members will come to Shanghai from the United States. Miss Belys herself is one of the lucky ones, having served in the army for forty months, making her one of the most senior members. She has been to Calcutta, India, and Chongqing. She used to work as a clerk in a department store in New York. Now, most of the members are working indoors in various departments of the British Royal Air Force. Miss Belys is responsible for sales work in the dormitory.</p>
<p>"During the war, we all liked to come abroad to work, both to serve the country and to see many new places," this is what Miss Belys told me, explaining why she liked to come abroad.</p>
<p>Walking into their recreation room, there was a ping pong table placed in a spacious rectangular room with a smooth and clean floor, where they usually held dances. Outside is a lawn with two tennis courts, which is more than enough for sixty or so young ladies to exercise outdoors. Afterwards, I also visited their dining hall, where they have two American army chefs. Guests are welcome to come to lunch and dinner, and of course, American soldiers are regular guests. Then I went upstairs to visit their bedrooms. Miss Dolores Nashi, also a staff sergeant, was wearing a purple-red shirt and writing a letter on the bed. When Miss Nashi saw Miss Belys, she asked when there would be a ship, but Miss Belys didn't know either.</p>
<p>"We all like Shanghai very much, but of course, we all want to go home!" said Miss Nashi.</p>
<p>Although we only talked for a few words, I found Miss Nashi very sincere and straightforward, and Miss Belys was also very patient in telling me this and that. There are about forty bedrooms on the second and third floors, but because they need to prepare beds for future arrivals, they are a bit crowded. Some rooms have two beds, some have three, and some have bunk beds. They also showed me the light taupe-colored clothes they wear after leaving the office, as well as winter coats, which are almost the same style as men's military uniforms. Miss Nashi said that most of her things have been packed, and she is just waiting for the day to leave. Each person can bring 185 pounds on the ship when they go back, and they can usually send 70 pounds of things home every month. When they were in India, they could only send 10 pounds of things a month.</p>
<p>Speaking of their usual entertainment, it's nothing more than shopping, watching movies, and dancing. Many American soldiers and sailors look for them to play with, which they find a bit of a headache. "However, when you know them for a long time, you can really find that they are all very good," Miss Nashi explained for the boys' mischief, "They sometimes tell jokes to Chinese girls, but they don't mean to at all. We know their temperaments, so they can't fool around with us." Miss Belys added, "We all understand our boys."</p>
<p>When asked about their impression of Shanghai, Miss Nashi said, "Shanghai is not the real China, Chongqing represents China." Miss Nashi had also been to Hangzhou and visited West Lake, and thought Hangzhou was very fun.</p>
<p>We talked for about ten minutes, and we were like old friends. When I said goodbye to Miss Nashi and went downstairs, Miss Belys pointed out their sales department, where various cigarettes, candies, supplies, and shirts, shoes, and antiques bought from the army exchange were displayed for the members to buy. It is said that they get thirty packs of cigarettes a month and twelve pairs of silk stockings a year, but in fact they have to buy more themselves. They also admire the cheongsams worn by Chinese women and have already made several, preparing to wear them when they go home.</p>
<p>At this time, the captain came back. She was quite young, very kind and charming. She is in charge of all the female corps members and is expected to be in the last batch to return home. Speaking of Shanghai, I honestly told her that it has regressed a bit compared to before. She said, "After the war is over, it will take a few more years to restore the previous situation!"</p>
<p>The residence of the U.S. Women's Auxiliary Army Corps is located on the relatively remote Julu Road. If you pass by there unintentionally, you may not notice it. This building has many rooms and all the necessary equipment, quiet and comfortable. The attached sales department sells various daily necessities, which the members flock to!</p>
<p>Because it was getting late, I didn't ask any more personal questions. So I stepped back onto the quiet asphalt road and said goodbye.</p>
<p>On the way back, I thought of that group of American young ladies who came to China for the first time. Like us, they feel that the gap between the two sides is still very deep. Undoubtedly, many of them cannot truly recognize China or understand the Chinese people. This is a good opportunity, I thought, why don't we let us contact them more and build a real friendship together!</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Repentance</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Yun: You and I don't write letters, and I completely admit my mistake; but you should know my bad habits, the more important things are, the less I do them, and the more I should write, the less I write. I also understand that because of this habit, I have messed up many things and been scolded many times, but the habit is still a habit, "It's easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one's nature." My recent failure to write letters is for this reason.</p>
<p>It's raining heavily again, the air pressure is so low that it's suffocating. People who don't smoke are smoking wildly. I'm pacing back and forth in my small attic room in Shanghai, going around and around in such a small circle. I want to sleep, to temporarily forget everything, to ignore everything, but I know I won't be able to fall asleep; I want to rush out, but where can I go? Shanghai is so noisy and complex, and people are so selfish and ruthless. What am I like wandering the streets? What is the purpose of running to people's doors randomly? You should ask why I don't write to you? Alas, I can only write a few random sentences to you.</p>
<p>What stings me the most is your words: "You left quietly before, leaving me in Shanghai under the iron hooves; now you have left lightly again, leaving me in the noisy Chongqing. In Shanghai, I suffered five years of disaster because of the iron hooves. Now, the noise is surrounding this cage-like Chongqing, and I can't fly away again! Moreover, I have been away from home for eight years, you should find a way to let me go home." Yun, these words stung my heart, and I shed tears again. If you say that my ability to fly out of Chongqing lightly this time is a "victory," then I am truly "triumphing at a great cost." This costly victory is not only because of my separation from you, but also a symbol of all the unexpected suffering after I arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>I do regret it, I shouldn't have flown here alone so naively, because I am neither a "receiver" nor have the ambition to "pass the imperial examination." What's the use of coming so early? If it's for my elderly parents whom I haven't seen for eight years, I haven't even gone to the countryside to visit them in the three months I've been in Shanghai. Now, I'm letting my elderly parents with their waning years continue to wait for their only son. They will definitely curse: "The war is over, why hasn't our son come back yet?" Now, I'm also letting you stay in the boiling pot of Chongqing, living the life of ants on a hot pot. You are anxious and worried, which is understandable.</p>
<p>When I left, I left you ten thousand yuan in royalties, but I also left you two children. Ten thousand yuan, at a time when it is depreciating more and more with each victory, what can you do with it? The two sons are constantly shouting for food and drink, and the older one is so naughty, which not only increases the material burden but also countless mental burdens. Yun, you are too bitter and too tired. You only had one child in Shanghai, and you were already overwhelmed. Originally, with your body and our situation, we shouldn't have had any sons. You went to Chongqing, and unfortunately another one was added. With your body and our situation, we shouldn't have two sons even more. If there were no sons, we would have fled together eight years ago, lightly and quickly fleeing to the rear. If there were no sons, you could work in the rear. A "literary person," even if she is a woman, would have no problem working as a clerk in a government office. With tens of thousands of yuan in salary and a stone of rice, you would have enough to cover your expenses. We would cooperate and live separately, giving both of us completely to the public. The time left over every day would still be our own. In this way, our life would be stable and worry-free, and our happiness would never be deprived. It is because of the two children that we have to raise our own money for clothing, food, housing, transportation, firewood, rice, oil, and salt. How can my meager income as a poor civil servant be enough to cover the expenses of this family? So you have suffered, working hard day and night. You work for nineteen hours a day, and even five hours of sleep a night are deprived by half because of Xiao Yang. I can see you getting thinner and thinner every day, and I can't reduce your pain. This is because I have read a little too many pedantic Chinese books, which make me unable to do anything. Otherwise, I could have used my power to find some "extra money," or partnered with others to run some business. At the same time, I also blame you for not being willing to abandon your empty titles of "scion of a noble family" and "literary scholar" and learn the new methods of your neighbors, such as setting up a cigarette stall or buying and selling used clothes.</p>
<p>I regret it very much, I shouldn't have let you have children. I regret it very much, and I shouldn't have let you have children when you arrived in Chongqing. I especially regret that when victory suddenly came, I was as overjoyed and rejoicing as a primary school student. So I ignored everything and flew to Shanghai rashly. I thought this was how I could go home and see my elderly parents whom I hadn't seen for eight years; I also thought that you and the two children could come soon. My ideal was not bad either. I would first look at relatives and friends in Shanghai, write letters home, and let my family tidy up a room for me to read in; tidy up a piece of grass for Xiao Yang to play on; tidy up some tools for Da Yang to experiment with. When you come, the four of us, big and small, will slowly walk back on the road we left eight years ago, intimately recognizing the mountains, rivers, fields, cattle, sheep, grass, and trees along the way, and even touching the wind, sun, moonlight along the way.</p>
<p>Then we will cry and laugh to our heart's content in front of our elderly parents, collect the regrets of our eight years of separation, and end our eight years of precarious life. But this has not yet been realized. Especially you, who gave up the thatched cottage in the countryside and sold the excess old clothes, you were convinced that you could sit on the ship, but who knew that most of the ships were taken by "gold bar refugees." Those without gold bars cannot sit, so you are trapped in the turbulent and foggy city of Chongqing.</p>
<p>That is to say, we were originally only divided into two places, but with victory, we are divided into three places. The old home has no enemies, but we still can't go back; you don't have gold bars, so you can't come down. But I am suspended in the middle, unable to see my parents or my wife. Where is my victory?</p>
<h3>Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Historical Knowledge</p>
<p>Seeing Jing Ke arriving so late, they all shouted for him to be punished with three cups. As they said this, a large bowl of hot wine was already handed to Jing Ke. Jing Ke drank the wine in one gulp and sighed, "The Qin state is really too domineering. Who knows how many more times we will have such a painful drink?"</p>
<p>The butcher Dog Tu recklessly continued, "We drink when we have wine, and eat when we have meat. Why bother sighing and saying these strange and old-fashioned words!"</p>
<p>Gao Jianli also hurriedly said, "You can't blame Jing Ke for that. With the Qin state being so tyrannical, we will inevitably suffer a great loss from it sooner or later!"</p>
<p>"That's right!" Jing Ke said. "I, Jing Ke, am determined to repay my country with my death. When necessary, I will never cherish this life."</p>
<p>After saying this, Jing Ke drank the second bowl of wine in one gulp. Gao Jianli and Dog Tu also silently drank their wine. Everyone was silent for a while, and Gao Jianli also sighed:</p>
<p>"No wonder I just passed through Middle Street and saw a large group of bookworms gathered there talking about 'horizontal alliance' and 'vertical alliance.' Some people said that if the Qin state sends troops east to attack Qi and Chu, the Yan state will certainly not be spared and must quickly think of a 'vertical alliance.' Some people said to unite the three Jins with Qi and Chu, and then together with the Huns to attack Qin, in order to save the situation in the event of an emergency. But some people also said that the 'vertical alliance' plan is time-consuming and protracted. Now the King of Han has already been captured, and his abandoned soldiers are threatening the capital of the Zhao state. We can only inspire our morale: repay the country with death. They argued back and forth, making a lot of noise."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Jing Ke drank the third bowl of wine in one gulp, saying word by word:</p>
<p>"Repay the country with death—repay the country with death."</p>
<p>Gao Jianli and Dog Tu couldn't help but glance at Jing Ke. Jing Ke's face was so excited, he opened his eyes wide and looked at the dark sky outside the window.</p>
<p>At this time, a person walked into the tavern and asked the proprietress if she sold wine here. The accent was very stiff, not like the way people in the Yan state spoke. Jing Ke saw him sitting at a table next to him, so he leaned over and asked:</p>
<p>"General, are you from the Qin state?"</p>
<p>That person was startled, but immediately calmed down and said, "I did flee from the Qin state to here. May I ask, how did you know this, despite our casual meeting?"</p>
<p>Jing Ke smiled and said:</p>
<p>"I heard that General Fan Yuqi came from the Qin state. Just now I heard that you have a Qin accent, so I asked. "The rash Dog Tu did not understand what the words "fled from" meant, only heard that he came from the Qin state, and was already itching to draw his knife. Gao Jianli hurriedly stopped him and said in a low voice, "The King of Qin is cruel and tyrannical. General Fan has offended the King of Qin and fled to the Yan state. Since we hate the tyranny of the King of Qin, how can we condemn General Fan!"</p>
<p>Gao Jianli's low words were also heard very clearly by Fan Yuqi; he was deeply moved by this kind of sympathy from a foreign country. "I have always heard that there are many generous and tragic patriots in the Yan and Zhao states, so I would rather wander to this place," he said.</p>
<p>Jing Ke and Gao Jianli thought he was straightforward and outstanding, so they invited him to sit at a table and drink wine. Gao Jianli also asked him if he knew that the King of Qin was offering a high price for his head?</p>
<p>Fan Yuqi sighed for a long time and said slowly: "When I crossed the Yi River and came to your country, I had already offered my head to the people of your country. On the one hand, I know that there are many generous and tragic patriots in Yan and Zhao, and on the other hand, I admire the wisdom of Prince Dan of Yan, so I did not hesitate to be presumptuous. Sure enough, Prince Dan took me in, and I will be grateful for the rest of my life." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Do Not Abandon the Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>During the war of resistance, the group that displayed the weakest strength was our art workers. Now that the war of resistance is won, all departments are clamoring for "rehabilitation"! But in our art circles, we don't hear anyone shouting "rehabilitation"! Of course, shouting "rehabilitation" is just lip service; the most important thing is to do it practically.</p>
<p>But even more strangely, Shanghai, which was originally an extremely prosperous art market, has become depressed after the victory and is about to stagnate, like the Chinese Painting Academy. Exhibitions have become a rarity. As for art publications, at least there is a weekly publication called "Art Life." Somewhere, a "Victory Woodcut" was published. Occasionally, one or two short articles commenting on art can be found in other newspapers, but that seems to be it.</p>
<p>Indeed, most art workers have changed careers due to the hardship of life, and exhibitions cannot be held due to excessive costs. The so-called art movement simply cannot be launched.</p>
<p>Shanghai is truly the birthplace of China's emerging art. To this day, there still exists the Shanghai Fine Arts School, with its long history, and many strong art workers around it. We only need to recall that the "model" issue in the past was a pioneering effort that was initiated in Shanghai and finally overcame feudal ethics. Now, is it really so difficult? I think, if the art workers gathered in Shanghai can unite to launch work, any ideal, whether it be art exhibitions, art publications, art galleries, art research institutes, art lectures... will slowly be realized. First of all, we hope that the art workers in Shanghai will stand together to generate strength.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope everyone will not forget: "Shanghai is the birthplace of China's emerging art."</p>
<h3>Social Service: Student Discussion Meeting, Instructing the True Meaning of Youth Service</h3>
<p>Five Hundred Students Greatly Inspired</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, this office convened a discussion meeting for aided students from high schools, vocational schools, universities, and other schools in the city. A total of 85 units and more than 560 students attended, gathering together, which was very lively. First, Mr. Huang Jiping reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that this newspaper has been advocating the student aid movement for five years, and a total of more than 25,000 students have been aided. In the past, during the enemy's occupation, gatherings and speeches lacked freedom, and they could not communicate with each other, which was deeply regrettable! Now, the War of Resistance has been won, the world has been restored to light, and everything has been restored to freedom. It is especially gratifying to meet with you all. In the future, the focus of this office's work will still be on student aid, so that you will not lose the opportunity to study due to poverty, but instead be inspired to move forward. However, today's youth are the cornerstone of the future society, and at this time, they should practice serving society to repay the great kindness of loving youth. Later, Mr. Zhao Zongyu elaborated on the true meaning of serving society, narrating his life experience; instructing young people on how to conduct themselves in the world; citing the words and deeds of ancient heroes, giving examples to illustrate, both serious and humorous, moving the listeners. He also reported on the assessment of service performance and reward methods, which greatly inspired the students. Finally, Mr. Zhuang Keming gave a speech, in which he also described his service experience and business ethics in great detail, and the meeting adjourned at half past ten.</p>
<h3>Letter: Discussing the Continuation of the National Arts Training Class</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: When your newspaper resumed publication, you listed advocating public sports as one of the social service undertakings, which we students are overjoyed to read. The Yongnian Taijiquan class was the only public sports undertaking founded by your newspaper on October 1st last year. It used the courtyard of the Taoist Association on Nantong Road as a training ground. It has been held for two sessions since its opening, and its characteristics are: (1) no political meaning, no party or religious colors; (2) no fees are charged, and men, women, old and young can join; (3) the institution has no burden other than printing application forms; (4) teacher Fu Zhongwen teaches completely voluntarily. The master is a descendant of the Yang family's authentic Taijiquan, and he has established the grand ambition of establishing himself and reaching others. He spares time from his business to teach, purely out of obligation, without receiving any reward. He endures severe cold and heat, regardless of wind and rain, four hundred days as one day, which is rarely seen in today's national arts circles in Shanghai. We colleagues are also inspired by Master Fu's noble personality, so we can diligently study and persevere to the end, without the bad habit of starting strong and finishing weak, which is praised by insiders and outsiders. The students have all graduated (the initial stage has come to an end). In this short period of four hundred days, they have benefited greatly in spirit and physical strength and are unwilling to interrupt their studies, so they consult with Master Fu to continue teaching. Because the body and use of Taijiquan can nourish life, defend against insults, heal diseases, and prolong life; it is profound and mysterious, and even if one spends his whole life, it is difficult to complete his studies. Now, two months have passed since the second graduation, and friends from the outside world have been asking when the third class will start. The students feel the earnestness of those who come, and dare to take the liberty of appealing to you to immediately start the third class to satisfy the public's expectations. The ancients did not abandon words because of the person, and the fool may have a gain. Since your newspaper regards serving society as its duty and promotes public sports as its goal, it should not allow this Taijiquan class, which has been held twice with outstanding results, to be interrupted suddenly. If it continues from the third class to the fourth and fifth classes, and even to the tenth and hundredth classes, so that this social undertaking, which benefits the people without costing much, can be continuously promoted, so that thousands of people can reach the realm of longevity together, then will those who benefit only be those who are eagerly looking forward to it today? The future of national public sports in our country truly relies on it. We hereby appeal to you, and wish you good health. Yongnian Taijiquan Class First and Second Term Students Together.</p>
<p>(Note) This office is currently looking for a suitable venue and will make a decision soon, and then announce the enrollment training. - Editor</p>
