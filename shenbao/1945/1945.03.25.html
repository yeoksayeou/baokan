<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日小磯首相向一億國民發表談話如次：敵美已突入我國前門，此誠爲有史以來之大難，目下局面可謂爲皇國存亡之關頭，故同胞之總蹶起，亦在今日，茲基於軍農一體，國民皆兵之本義，一億國民應武裝防衛神州，以完成皇國萬壽無疆之大任。欲打開此種危急之戰局，唯在發揮吾國數千年來傳統之底力，因之除非國民團結一致，以突擊敵軍外，則別無善策。政府刻已決定組織國民義勇隊，並依挺身報國之方策，以資堅强防衛及增加生產，同時於情勢緊急之環境下，準備執戈殺敵，　可防衛本土。由該項組織國民均站立於遂行戰爭之一　，以身報國，確立必勝之體制，固然所謂防衛國土不僅在執戈殺敵一途，即在軍需生產，食糧增產及運輸等後方各種工作上，亦應倍加努力，蓋此在防衛國土上所獲之功效，亦非同小可也。全國國民只要挺身出動，完成國家之緊急業務，則任何敵人均不足　，且偉大之戰力及强靱之防衛力，亦可因之產生。余對國民克服此種難局之堅毅精神，至爲信任，若夫全國國民將所有之能力盡量貢獻國家，則可完成擔當保衛皇國之使命。總之，一億同胞不問男女老幼，均應團結，皆爲防衛之一員，犧牲個人之精神，從事生產，負防衛之重任，以廢私奉公，則必勝之戰力自可增强，而勝利大道亦指日可待也。</p>

<p>東京二十四日中央社電　海軍報道部栗原部長，於二十三日大本營公布戰績後發表談話如次：日軍此次予敵機動部隊之打擊，實極重大，此種戰果，乃聖威所賜·同時爲前綫將士勇戰奮鬥之結果，誠不勝感謝之至。從現代戰之性格言，謂爲一億國民總力之戰果，亦無不可，惟今日來襲之敵　動部隊，非敵之全兵力，且予敵之打擊固大，但非決定的打擊。就月下形勢判斷，敵今後將再度來犯，如敵來襲，吾人唯有發揮一億總力，予敵以大打擊。現在前綫將士士氣日旺，上自最高指揮官，下至一兵一卒，均確倍能把握戰機，予敵迎頭痛擊。</p>
<p>媲美台灣海面戰果</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　出現於九州東南海面之敵機動部隊，經日特攻隊並航空部隊之先制攻擊及其後四日內於白畫·薄暮，夜間連續强襲，收獲莫大戰果，已由大本營分別發表，未確認戰果，尙達相當多數，未經包括在內。此次來襲之敵機動部隊，係由航空母艦中數艘爲主力而組成，實力相當雄厚，然至二十一日敵機動部隊開始潰退時，爲數則已寥寥，由此可知日方所獲戰果，實超過發表範圍以上，實際上業已殲減其兵力之大半。一方面繫落敵機約一百八十架，其中　未包括航空母艦搭載之艦載機在內，故與航空母艦共其運命之敵機數量必達多數，自不待言。此次所收獲擊沉正規航空母艦五艘之戰果，足與去秋台　海面航空戰戰果之先後媲美，實爲對敵企圖接近本土不逞妄圖之一當頭棒喝。</p>

<h3 id="c6">根據還都時三大國策　在奮鬥中求生存　陳院長對浙省各機關人員訓話 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>杭州二十四日中央社電　陳院長於抵抗巡視時，曾對浙省機關工作人員訓話，其原文如下：</p>
<p>項省長，各位同志，本人今天到杭視察，在黨·政·軍各機關巡視後，又聽取各長官的報告，現在再來和各位談談，很覺欣慰。</p>
<p>現在距離國府還都五週紀念沒有幾天了，本人今天就簡單的和各位講講國府的政策和今後努力的方針。</p>
<p>。國府的政策不變。</p>
<p>時局已非常迫切，我們回憶五年前汪先生所揭　的和平反共建國的國策，簡單的說，這三原則的內容，以和平爲取中國的自由，以反共實現中國的統一，以建國鞏固中國的獨立。這三原則至今未變，以後也不會變，直到完成中國的自由統一獨立，進而担負本東亞建設的任務。</p>
<p>國府還都五年來，同志們努力爭取這三大目標，已得到相當成效，這是値得自負的，不要以爲尙未完成而自餒，假使還都沒有這五年的努力，今日的中國成何模樣，地方的元氣，人民的觀感，國基的鞏固，都不會有今日的局面。雖然還有許多未能盡如人意，例如：同盟條約已成立，租界已收回，不平等條約已廢止，這是中國自鴉片戰後百年來的願望，但因全面和平尙未實現，同盟條約中的撤兵問題仍未能實行，這實是非常遺憾。然而過去中央和地方各同志的努力，創造了今日的局面，這是非常的光榮，莫大的功勳，我們不要妄自菲薄，要明白自己的立塲，認識努力的價値，迎合迫切的時局，爭取中國的自由，統一與獨立。</p>
<p>。今後努力的方針。</p>
<p>次之，要講到今後努力的方針，我們怎樣做去，還是要根據還都時的三大國策，在舊鬥中求生存，奮鬥的方法：</p>
<p>第一，要把國民黨重新建六起來，此次本人兼任中央組織部長，就想把黨的組織健全起來，過去曾標榜着黨·政·軍一元化，因爲黨是有主義的組織，而政治·軍事都是推行主義的手段，黨的組織空虛了，政·軍就不能配合，黨就沒有力量，雖然有政綱，而政·　就要分離。國民黨自停止選舉指派代表以來，已經不健全了，變成對建組織，分成個人的派別，援引私人，以致組織渙散，不能指揮政治和軍事。我們現在要把四分五裂的黨重加組織，只知有黨的同志，不知有私人，所以現在辦理選舉，成立黨的大本營，共同參加組織，有團結才有力量，才能指揮政·軍·才可完成和平反共建國。</p>
<p>第二，現在共產黨非常猖獗，新四軍到處擾亂，共產是無祖國的蘇維埃，就是一個無祖國的組織，現在戰事日長，共黨開展更速，反共是我們一個最高的原則，要統一中國，要安定民生，非反共不可。</p>
<p>。求解放獨立自由。</p>
<p>第三，本國參戰是自動的，並不受別國的慫恿態度，因爲百年來英。美帝國主義使中國淪爲次殖民地，資源被　奪，人民被勞役，要求解放，非與帝國主義者開戰不可。不勞力量薄弱，只要意志堅强，我們的參戰是打倒英·美帝國主義，凡是淪中國爲殖民地的帝國主義，我們都要同他們開戰，即使英。美在中國登陸，我們還是政策不變，要和他們決戰到底，即使我們失敗了，還有我們的第二代，第三代，我們非如此決戰不能求解放·求獨立自由。</p>
<p>第四，自還都後，本人屢次言及國家建立在人民身上，要求國家的生存和發展，全靠我們全體人民的努力，沒有一個國家依靠別國而能獨立自主的，復興中國，要靠我們自己。有許多人認爲前途無望，過一日算一日，不振作精神，也不爲國家努力，所以復興的成績很少，我們幼時看歷史，看見范仲淹常以「天下爲己任」，就是雖是常人，也要有對國家負責的意思，現在有這樣意志的人很少，終日彷徨，要曉得我們有政策，有主義，在這樣迫切的時局中，正大有可爲，我們每一個單位，每一個人，要一心一德共同克服困難，渡過時艱，中央與地方互相信賴，同爲國家努力。</p>
<p>同志們，要明瞭國府政策以及今後怎樣做去，提起勇氣，振作精神，中國的前途大有希望。</p>

<h3 id="c7">戰爭與犯罪 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 大森洪太</p>
<p>刑罰是希冀無刑罰的，這句至理明言，固觸難於實現的理想，但凡任司法者，總是以此爲最高目標。希望犯罪減少，固屬在任何時代都是馨香祈禱的事，但在空前絕後的大戰中的今日，在擊潰當前頑敵前，爲了爭取勝利，而盡量消滅犯罪行爲，這是人所共　的一件大事。假如一有了犯罪者，則除了實行檢察，裁判，行刑等繁多手續外，還給人民以不安的影響。現在正當舉全國總力，爲必勝目的而供獻一切的千鈞一髪時期，如因犯罪而勞神費力，豈不是令人鄙棄的事麼？</p>
<p>目前日本的治安情形，是交戰國中最穩固者，尤其比較敵人英美，是有天壞懸殊。實例固不　枚舉，但試觀日本歸女的保持貞操，堪稱世界之冠，返觀英美婦女的敎　，非常低劣，所以在後方關於貞操問題，醜態畢露，而英美之不能致勝，亦將在此播下因種。此次大戰，日本取得大捷，一方面也可以說是貞操的勝利，日本婦女這種光榮，是將永垂史册的。此外，敵國戰時在工塲內的失盜，有增無已，我們可以想像到其損失是驚人的。因爲英國很早以前，賊盜就特別多。固然有不少人只看到英國人的紳士假面具，而不知內部的實情者，但老實說，英國人的確是富於賊盜癖的。英國女僕不偷主人貴重品者，是百無一見的，所以家庭主婦日常最煞費苦心者，就是對用人的戒備。英國古來的賊盜搶劫記載，實在是滿篇累牘，無盡不有。其刑法史上人所共曉者，就是英國對竊盜的決定處罰，非常嚴格。五先令（値日鈔二元五角）以上的偷竊，戶外的搶刦，馬廄的馬賊，養魚池的魚賊，都定處以極刑，這種法律，曾施行了好久，甚至進入近世後，仍曾實施過。這種明文規定長期有效的本身，不必看實在檢舉數目的多寡，就可以瞭然知道英國賊盜非常的多。至於美國，早有著名犯罪國和罪惡淵藪之稱，決非無的放矢。其受刑者數目佔着總人口的極大比例，遠超過他國。此外司法警察的無能爲力，政黨的跳梁，財閥之跋扈，政族間的對立等，都成爲肅淸犯罪行爲的絕大障碍。而不知恥的倖免於法的犯罪者，全世界人士都知道，在都市中有如過江之鯽。戰前旣是如此，那末生活日艱的戰時下，美國內部犯罪的層出不窮，治安的動搖，當局的狼狽等，是可以相像而知的。</p>
<p>兩國用總力和總力相對抗，不待言的，首先正面相遇者，自然是戰爭。但武力戰之外，還有經濟戰，思想戰，以及維持國內治安的競爭戰。爲獲致勝利，就必須以一絲不紊的態勢，高度地維持治安。凡能高度維持治安的國家，就是勝利有望的國家。所以上面已經講過，日本治安現狀，固然遠勝於其他國家，但爲了加强堅固的必勝信念，而就必須使國內治安，百尺竿頭更進一步。這就是說，治安穩走還求穩定，本着膽大心細的精神，防止犯罪於未然，所以向全國人士謹陳愚見，希望相之勉勵。</p>
<p>第一，勿迷惑於流言蜚語。戰爭愈持久，而流言蜚語愈易發生，即稍明事理的人，也有時被無稽之談所蒙蔽者。敵人英美對於散佈謠言一點說，是上次世界大戰出過風頭的。現在他們當然還要施展其所有陰謀，對付日本。日本人民最要緊者，就是堅定信仰，勿予敵人可乘之機，建立預防流言蜚語的鞏固心理之長城。</p>
<p>第二，在日常生活中，勿自暴自棄。在這樣驚天地泣鬼神的大戰下，生活艱苦是應當的。然而回憶旣往，我們的日常生活曾流於奢侈。如只迷戀於往昔的燈紅酒綠，紙醉金迷，而不滿於今日的樸素衣食，這是大錯而特錯的事。忍苦耐勞，這也是取得勝利之道。</p>
<p>第三，必須相互開誠佈公。精誠團結，一致對外，則需要內心的和睦。換言之，大後方的開誠佈公和意見無問，就是爭取勝利不可或缺的要素。相互從容受苦，才能在不久的將來迎接光明燦爛的勝利。人心荒亂，就會促成犯罪的大本營，所以最需要戒的。</p>
<p>上述三戰雖是最平凡的老生常談，但在預防戰犯罪行爲這一點上說，是有極大意義的，望三思之。</p>

<p>市宣傳處主持之第九次新聞記者例會，於二十四日下午假市府一三九室舉行，由淸鄉事務局局長蘇成德出席答復各報社記者所提有關淸鄉工作之疑問多則，問答畢，各報社記者復就各地封鎖管理之不良情狀提出討論，當承蘇氏一一說明。茲錄問答詳情如下：</p>
<p>施政方針　（一）（問）淸鄉事務局目下施政之方針如何？</p>
<p>（答）淸鄉爲政府國策，本局目下施政方針，對於已經淸鄉之地區治安良好者，當緊緊把握，進而使地方治安獲得確實保障，益趨鞏固，對於未經清鄉之地區治安狀況不良者，當於本年度內决第實施清鄉。關於此點，目下已有相當計劃，不久即可實現。當茲大東亞戰爭已臨決勝之階段，戰事增產愈見重要，而地方治安之確立，實爲增加生產之前提，故淸鄉工作，已爲爭取大東亞戰爭勝利之一環，本局惟有恪秉國策，在市長領導下單勉以赴，以期完成吾人之任務也。</p>
<p>（二）（問）上海市目第三期淸鄉工作結束後迄已多時，惟查尚有少數地區禾經淸鄉工作，請問貴局有何計劃？</p>
<p>（答）關於此點，上項已略有所述。本期淸鄉地區之擇定及詳細計劃內容，目下尚不能公開披露耳。</p>
<p>工作範圍　（三）（問）查各地清鄉工作所　之封鎖處任務，均由淸鄉局負責辦理，以期清鄉工作得能圓滑推進，何以本市封底沒處工作單獨成立？</p>
<p>（答）本市封鎖管理處以前曾　屬本局管轄，本年二月份起奉令直屬市政府，最近市府爲求行政機構簡素起見，令劃歸保安司令部，設置封鎖科，此種樣構與隸屬之變更，並不影響淸鄉工作之推進。淸鄉工作之範圍，本包經濟封鎖等各種事務，本局對於上列各種事務，均有計劃審議之責，不因款勵如何而有不同也。</p>
<p>（四）（問）本市淸鄉工作之政工任務，其推進情形如何？</p>
<p>（答）關於政治工作團之糾織，本局前奉市府轉奉行政院令發各省市淸鄉政治工作團組織通則，令飭遵辦，以期推進淸鄉工作等因，奉此，經詳加研討，以便着手草擬各項組織及經費槪算等，現已擬竣，不日可呈府核示。</p>
<p>（五０（問）本市清鄉已吿完成，何以各處封鎖點仍未除去，請問理由？</p>
<p>（答）關於已經清鄉之地區封鎖綫及檢問所之存廢，係國一整個問題，在各地方當遵奉命令施行。</p>
<p>掃除積弊　（六）（問）各處封鎖綫障礙物，早經全部拆除，僅存之封鎖點，對封鎖意義，似已消失，所有駐各封鎖點之工作人員，無非遇有物資經過，收索通行費而已，簡直等於過去里卡，從事擾民，不知當局深知吾，有何處置辦法？又據各方報吿與記者親自目睹，每一封鎖點，凡有非禁運之物資通過，公然索付通行費，譬如猪一頭五百元七百元不等，否則故意留難，人民叫苦連天。反之，確是違禁品，祗當出以通行費，亦可照常通過，此種情形，常局何以置若罔聞？</p>
<p>（答）關於上述問題，上月市畏在市政諮詢委員會全體會席議上，曾提到關於「改良封鎖管理處」謂「過去對於人民的勒索，甚於過去的釐金，重重剝削，漫無標準，鄉民有苦，無從申訴，本來打算將封鎖完全取消，因爲關係方面交涉還沒有辦好，現在想將封鎖處用人減到最低限度，而且提高其待遇，嚴密其監察，如有違法之徒，輕則監禁，重則槍決，以減少人民的痛苦云云。」現市政府已令將封鎖管理處劃歸保安司令部，設置封鎖科，目前吾惟有秉承市畏意旨，努力於積弊之掃除，以蘇民困。</p>

<p>（二）學生楊慰琦慰梅來函說「：我們看見貴報發起義學金，十分同情，尤其許多小朋友們，都很熟心義助，更是感動。我們也是兩個很幸福的小學生，想到無力求學的小朋友們，多麼痛苦。因此這義學金運動，確是很需要很迫切的！所以也想盡一點義務，今天是三妹慰椿天殤的週年日子，我們在追念和痛思之下，要求我們的家長，把無意識的耗費省下來，凑成國幣五千元，捐助貴報「義學金」，來紀念三妹慰椿。這小小數目，雖然沒有力量，但是大家起來響應，就很可觀了！」</p>
<p>（三）戚維專君來函說：「小兒錦華，在泰康路二八四號華廣義務小學讀書，昨日放學還家，講述伊校內捐款捐書，響應貴報所發起創辦義務小學的事，津津有味。我仔細聽了以後，大爲感動。因爲我小時也是一個飽嘗失學苦捕的人，爲了不識字，只得在一家米店裏當老司務，勉强維持生活。而小兒錦華，又沒人照料，幸虧老　厚道，讓錦華住在店中。但是求學問題，仍舊無法解決，幸得華廣義務小學，專收淸寒學生，才得免費入學。</p>
<p>但是目前上海，生活這樣困難，失學兒童何止千萬，所以貴報發起創辦義務學校，意義非常重大。我雖然能力薄弱，也想略盡棉力，節省吾與錦兒倆的早點錢二千元，捐作「義學金」，以表示我的同情。」</p>

<h3 id="c36">日本空軍部隊　對敵潛艇作戰記 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>攻擊潛艇的作戰，並非容易的事。我們的基地爲了防備美國機動部隊的活動，總是不分晝夜地保衛着海洋。每逢運輸船隊出去進行補充任務歸來的時候，我們基地的空軍部隊就忙碌得喘不過氣來。此外每逢發現敵美　水艇時，則追擊　滿殺氣的敵方潛艇，實在是一件近代科學化的舉動。發現敵方潛艇的電報收到後，立刻首先向各方派出　敵機。然而找得到這並不是一件輕而易舉的事。因爲有時候敵艇實行潛行，有時候天氣惡劣無法索敵。</p>
<p>然而一經發見敵方潛艇時，勝利總歸是我們的。我們實行迅雷不及掩耳的轟炸，並召來自己的戰鬥機，而交與海防艦及驅潛艇以完成消滅敵艇的工作。發見敵艇及確定其位置，這實在是談何容易的戰鬥。這主要就要靠電波探知器以及其他的機器。該空軍部隊的一個飛行隊長常說：</p>
<p>「我們的戰鬥決不可以盲目的。電波探知器如果發生毛病，這比飛機引擎出了毛病還壞。假如電波探知器發生毛病，只好回歸基地」。</p>
<p>潛艇墳墓</p>
<p>在我們日本本土的近海上，有好幾個地方稱作潛艇墳墓的海面。日本運輸船往返最多的路綫，也就是敵方潛艇最常出現的所在。</p>
<p>有一個地點，自從一九四三年下半期以來，擊沉六隻艇，第二個地點擊沉四隻，第三個地點曾擊沉三隻。其他地點擊沉尙不在少數。擊沉的數字，並非單就襲擊時的目睹而言，而還要在沉沒地點加以調查，並　實判斷敵方艦型時而才發表。</p>
<p>就我們部隊的特殊任務言，暗夜飛行是特別重要的。在暗夜海洋上，用電波探知器偵察屏息靜氣漂浮着的敵方潛艇。</p>
<p>攻擊敵艇</p>
<p>新井少尉是廣島高師舉業的空軍預備學生，一月二十四日早晨，黑　密佈，在白色浪潮　騰的海面上，發見了漂浮着的敵方潛艇。是其有晝夜兼用的潛望鏡，和豎文着三根電波探知器的天綫這樣大型潛水艇。敵方因爲落雨而就疏忽起來，但知道被發見後，艇尾就像直豎起來一樣，立該進行迅速潛行，不到二三十秒就在海面上不見了。我然向沉入處轟炸着，曾監視了一小時之久，很可惜竟因油桶漏油，而不得不勉强歸還基地。</p>
<p>大向飛行曹長，以前曾在南海某基地保護船隊飛行的時候，剛一出港就發見三隻敵方潛艇正在襲擊，於是立刻開始攻繫潛入水底十五公尺的敵方潛艇。當時用無綫電由各處召笑來將要回歸基地的日本飛機，不論敵艇一出一入，總是酬以炸彈。同時日本的潛艇也參加作戰，終於使該處海面上浮出大最的汕來，這可以斷定擎沉了兩隻敵艇。</p>
<p>村飛行曹長有一天曾發見敵艇的汕紋，所謂油紋，就是潤滑油等的滲　，在潛水艇移動的方向上有直徑二三公尺的油，斷斷續續地漂浮十公尺，但波浪大時，非常不容易發見。該曹長發見這種油紋後，立刻加以轟炸。在太陽光綫映照下，閃閃作光的油紋停止了，但又逐漸擴大了。</p>
<p>護送船隊</p>
<p>護送船隊，這是我們基地部隊的日常任務，除　海防艦反罪潛艇直接護送外，還有一個基地一個基地的飛機，像接力賽跑一樣擔任着空中護送。在一片汪洋的海面上，船隊如果不經指出，是很難發見的，但飛行員在天空上盤旋着尋霓豆粒般大的船隊。在運輸船上，渺乎其小的人類在揮動着帽子，搖擺着着，以表示感謝。在敵美潛挺神出鬼沒的海面上，遇見嗡嗡飛翔的日本飛機，往往使水手們的眼眶中迸出熱淚來。（林譯自三月九日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>— 趙一山</p>
<p>在一個春寒料峭的早晨，我懷着一種愉快的心情，到車站預備搭慢車到蘇州轉到東山去。車站上是滿滿的人，都在售票的門口那兒擠，擠得連口氣都喘不過來，黑帽子手裏的籐鞭雨點似的往下打，打得每個旅客的心裏都充滿了忿怒，含着恨火的眼光，望着黑帽子底下一顆露着獠牙帶着吃人般獰笑的臉，這是一個悲痛得不可想像的塲面，這樣足足等了有二個多鐘點。路局方面臨時貼出通告，說是今天的慢車暫停，擠的人羣開始由興奮的希望裏跌到失望的沉淵裏，帶着懊傷的心情各自散去。我探聽到這幾天路局的慢車時有時無，沒有一定，我因爲急於要往東山，二來很想看看沿公路到蘇州去的情形，所以決定改乘汽車。在新垃圾橋北堍有專門搭客的小汽車公司，去接洽的結果，當天的車子都客滿了，祗有一輛載貨的卡車，尙可在裝貨之餘，帶幾個乘客，於是化了二萬三千元的代價，於九時三十分坐在裝滿香烟的卡車上，像貨物一樣地開始走上了去蘇州的旅途。</p>
<p>滬蘇道上</p>
<p>到蘇州去的公路，因爲戰事的關係，沿途的路面都有了破壞，尤其到蘇州去有近百座木橋，這些橋因爲無人負責修理，損壞得很利害，有的簡直不能通過，就是勉强的走了過去，也是非常危險的，大部份汽車到蘇州去都是沿交通路　楊家橋轉眞南路，同崑太路直達蘇州。在離蘇州不遠的地方的地方外跨塘，前幾天有一段公路不能行走，汽車就要經錫滬路到常熟再抵蘇州。我去的那天那段公路語是可以走了，可是到了那個地方，車子的後輪陷入泥中，　客都得下車暫時充當小工，把車子上的貨物一件一件的搬下來，幾幾乎就楚　着車子走了一段路才能到蘇州，這一下躭誤了三個鐘頭。我是由上午九時三十分起程到夜裏十一點才到蘇州。足足走了十三個半鐘點，經過地方是眞茹，南翔，嘉定，外　，太倉，崑山，正儀，唯亭，蘇州等。沿途旅客及貨物檢查的機關有中山路財政部查緝處，江海關中山路支所及監視所，外崗財政部查緝處，嘉定縣胡家橋大檢問所，太倉大檢問所，崑山大檢問所，蘇州大檢問所，尙有其他很小的查緝處多處，簡直是三步一關，五步一卡，沿途皆有，每個關卡車子都須停留，時間的長短就要看去辦交涉的人手腕如何而定。沿途的米價由滬到蘇是漸漸的低下來，上海買十萬，眞茹是九萬，太倉是七萬，崑山是六萬，蘇州是五萬。南翅到上海之間走單帮的人很多，大都是將米糧搬至上海，每個人能背五斗左右，有的騎了自行車那就能搬足一担了，據這樣走單帮的人說也不過是爲了糊口而已。沿途治安很好。</p>
<p>蘇州現况</p>
<p>「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」這是一句人人都知道的話，事變後的蘇州，雖然比不得從前那樣的天堂，可是在上海大米賣到十萬一擔的時侯，蘇州的米價還祗有四五萬之間，這不能不說是仍保持着天堂的幸福。蘇州近來的情形像是很活躍，單看那幾家咖啡座從上海請來了能唱歌的女明星，在「麥克風」前唱上一二段流行歌曲，一杯淸茶的代價就化去了近千元，可是座客還是擠得滿滿的。那些普通的茶樓如吳苑·紅星等亦是夕無虛座，年紀大的老人以及年幼的孩童，都是捧着茶壼悠閒地在消磨時光。觀前街上人馬來往，喧喧嚷嚷熱鬧的情形不亞於上海的南京路，旅館的生意也是天大客滿，普通一點的房間，房租在一千元以上。租房屋近來很有些困難，好的房不要說租不到，就是有，也同土海一樣的要頂費，房租是以米價計算的多，大約在一二担左右一個月。近來這幾日因電力限制·晚上有的時候電力沒有，因此夜市很受了一些影響。「馬車到虎邱！」還是依舊在街節叫喚着，雖說遊客不如前時，馬夫們也還可以度過最低的生活。玄妙觀　玩黃雀的人依然不少，一手放　，一手取食，那種自得的神氣，你不會想到這是一個戰禍蔓延的世界，蘇州人的悠閒自在，使這句「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」的話的確有牠的存在性的。</p>
<p>東山一瞥</p>
<p>東山是屬於吳縣管轄下一個孤峙太湖中的島嶼，全山周圍約六十公里，氣候良好，土地肥沃。自蘇州去東山去是在胥門外面搭船時，船是用一艘木炭機動輪拖着走，速度不十分快，行走得很平穩，船公司月前祗有一家名叫保興輪船局，每天由東山蘇州對開一班，票價每人一千二百元，飯金連小脹一千五百元，每船可坐三百人左右。早晨九時開船，坐在隨波前進的船上，兩岸風景秀麗，經橫塘，溪上，木履，橫涇，浦涇，石塘，度村而到東山。在橫塘後的石湖，木履橋過去的白楊　二處，這是二個太湖的口子，汪洋浩瀚，碧波萬頃，但是盜匪的山沒爲害行旅，所以船經過這裏有點危險，從前曾經有船在這裏出過事，最近在船隻經過的時侯，有幾個武裝同志在岸上持槍保護，這一來還沒有什麽意外發生。在橫涇有橫涇檢問所，檢閱的手續並不十分麻煩，船約於下午五時左右到達東山的前山。東山全山分爲前後二部，以莫　峰爲界，南爲前山，北爲後山，全山的人口原有二萬六千人，最近增至三萬餘人。最高的行政機構是舊第十二區區署，負責區長的人現在是趙式民氏。另有警察所，保安隊，最近治安情形頗爲良好。全山空屋多數拆毀，有的也是一小部份，空地很多，尤其是可以開墾的田地爲數不少，最熱鬧的街道是東街，西街也可以說是全山的商業匯集地。商業方面最大的是米業，有同泰生等幾家，洋貨次之，有計順興等幾家，小工業尙付缺如。電燈沒有，電報不能直通，有郵局一所，轉遞信札。米糧全賴鄰近橫涇，吳江，平望，湖州等地輸入維持，量的方面不甚充足，日前米價約四萬左右一石，肉價市秤八百餘元，蔬菜老秤一百五十元一斤，魚類六百餘元一斤。全山居民大半以養魚種植菓木爲主，過去也曾有過一些好的日子，現在情形也不如前了，因此生活很苦。全山一年的出產有三月茶葉，產量約五擔，五月的楷杷約三千擔，六月的楊　約六千擔，七月的白菓　子約一千五百擔，魚蝦全年約有二千擔，還有一種出名的羊肉，基爲可口，竹木產量相當富饒，用之造屋十分相宜。全山有文昌，務本，鐘秀，莫釐，西塢，潦國等學校，山民受敎育的還受佔着少數。全山以前山較爲熱鬧，後山僻靜一點。山民的性情勤儉，刻苦耐勞，對於外來旅客很是和善，假如能够在這裏舉辦一些小工業和科學管理的農塲，是極有發展的一種事業。記者在該山逗留數天之久，觀察之餘，對於項康元氏創議　洞庭山爲疏散目的地一議，甚爲贊同。</p>
<p>疏散問題</p>
<p>正如項先生所說的，切不可作爲戰時避難的權宜措　，而應抱着百年大計的方針，即在承平以後，更應繼續經營發揚光大。我們與其拿東山作爲一時避難的塲所，倒不如作爲永久的經營較爲適宜。東山有着牠豐富的生產，和良妤的環境，尤其在這到處烽烟的時候，東出孤立於太湖中，倒也可以算避世的桃源，要是經營得宜，不難成爲一個風景秀麗的住宅區，但在此移民之先，必須有周詳的計劃，方能事半功倍。</p>
<p>目前東山居民約三萬餘人，如項先生提議第一次前去爲十萬人的話，那麼平均一幢平房住上二十個人，就需要五千幢平房。現在東山所有的空屋爲數甚少，毋須事先建築簡單的平屋，以備十萬人的住所。山上建築五千幢平屋的空地決不發生問題，全山永電的設備應建立起來，多創辦小工業來能解決移民的日常生活，應與當地居民合作辦理規模宏大的農塲及水產公司，增加山上的生產，這些都可以作爲投資的辦法來做，較爲易辦（事實上這種投資是合理而有成效的）。目前東山的居民大半是從事種植和販賣的，工業十分缺少，以環境上來說決不是絕對的不可能，十萬人中必須有公共醫院五所，程度不等的學校二十間，擴大郵局的組織，這些必須由當局協助建設。至於行政機構的擴大與治安的確保，那當然尤須當局協助，方能成事。民政協議會的組織是不可缺少的，在一個龐大的新建設之下，協議會有其協調和推動的力量，合作社是需要成立的一個組織。利用移民質的方面差別達到互相合作互相發展的狀態。目前山民的生活，頗行艱苦，必須事先想定辦法，如何使山民與移民部的經濟取得協調，不致發生摩擦（按過去大量的移民是會發生與有居民間種種不幸的，這決不是用壓力可以解決的一件事）。山上的食糧不甚充足，非事先取得充分的補給不可，好在鄰近各縣產米甚豐以物資交換的辦法，取得充分的食糧，尙非難事，但是計　與執行者的周詳嚴密是不可忽視的。至於運輸移民及其物件尤須倔定專輪，每次至少以三千人爲一大隊，每船規定三百人爲一分隊，派定隊長管理行旅上必有的事項，由滬直駛東山，船上備有自衛的武裝，沿途檢查機關事先取得連絡，避免不必要的留難和麻煩，旅費的規定最好是將沿途用支統計分派，較爲公允。</p>
<p>總之，東山的居民因爲在生產技術方面不加改進，將成退化的形勢，假使借助移民的力量，增加資金，改進技術則全山的生產，必能增加，所以移民往東山的主旨，決不是消極性的避難而已，是有着積極的建設性的！</p>
<h3 id="c39">集團步行疏散 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 李恩德</p>
<p>際此米珠薪桂百物騰貴之時，加以空襲之威脅，上海實有疏散的必要。然進備疏散歸鄕者雖衆，却迪於交通不便，車船缺乏，舉棋不定者一定很多。</p>
<p>鑒於交通工具之缺乏，而急待疏散者如此之衆，不如規定搭乘車船，婦孺老弱有優先權，一般年靑力壯者，應自動集團步行返鄕。過去，香港疏散，即曾有多人集隊步行繞道抵滬，故此舉非全不可能。但單人行走不便，沿途尤乏照顧，故非集隊不可。茲略述方然於後：</p>
<p>（一）疏散委員會與各同鄕會會同登記自願步行疏散者。</p>
<p>（二）集五十人至一百人爲一隊，以同鄕同縣區分之，每隊設隊長一人，以幹練者充任，其組織可參照普通學校團體等之旅行隊辦法。</p>
<p>（三）由疏散委員會或同鄕會，派員領導及任交涉保護之責。</p>
<p>（四）由疏散委員會或同鄕會，於沿途中各重要鄕鎭，預先接洽公共塲所及學校·廟宇·祠堂等作爲休息借宿之地，必要時得暫設招待所接待之</p>
<p>（五）由歸鄕者給予疏散委員會或同鄕會用費若千，其數目視需要確定之，以節省爲原則。</p>
<p>（六）事先準備沿途膳食，或隨帶乾糧，各人自理。</p>
<p>（七）帶物以少量爲便，但亦可集多人合僱挑天，俾空身行走，格外方便。</p>
<p>（八）今以步行返寗波之路程爲例：由滬赴甬，可經杭州渡錢塘江，經　山紹興餘姚抵甬，但亦可由閔行至乍浦或澉浦，渡杭州灣抵餘姚，安東或上處地界，但以後者較爲便捷。然渡杭州灣時，有盜刼之處，故非有軍　保護不可。沿路停宿如以閔行爲第一站，金山或乍浦爲第二站，過江餘姚爲第三站，酌量路途，以定宿處，約四五天可抵甬。</p>

<h3 id="c40">笛手 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 沙鷗</p>
<p>我的小房間面對着一條嘈雜的市街，那裏鎭日價　　　攘；孩子歌唱，　婦罵街，小販暗啞的喉聲招徠　　客，要　的乞求着……市聲交　成一支人生交响　曲。悲哀也罷，喜悅也罷，日子總　　地又淡淡地流過去，這裏頭自然也洶去了我的一份。</p>
<p>早晨，學徒卸去了排門板，　　的市　就湧將出來。黃昏，</p>
<p>他們上了排門，市聲給關閉進去。這時光，在薄暮黯淡的街頭上，遂有賣笛兒胡琴的老頭演奏了。</p>
<p>嘹　的笛聲在暮色裏激盪，你也曾獨在於斗室中，不經心聽到誰家女子和着琴聲在輕哼京調？低廻的餘響使你不安於寂寞·更壞的是他誘惑了你的幻想。不久，我竟宣佈：我要做一個流浪的笛手，我要吹起笛兒　獨於小街陋巷。我要誘惑少男少女，使他們不安於寂寞，就像那老頭一樣，勾引孩子們滿街跟着我流浪。</p>
<p>老祖母笑我沒出息。她告訴我：許多年靑人愛笛兒，那淸澈的音響，他們一年到頭吹呀吹的，人瘦弱了，人萎枯了……假使你懷疑，你將他捫的笛兒劈開，那裏邊儘是血——年靑人的心血。</p>
<p>但是，老祖母不能抑阻我熱情的奔放。終於在　昏的街頭上，我追上了吹笛兒的老頭，我向他買了一支笛兒。我說：</p>
<p>「把　　　的一支給我！」</p>
<p>「每一支笛兒者　吮。」他漠然回答。隨便揀一支給我。</p>
<p>此後，笛兒消磨了我的光陰。我撮着口吹，又尖起嘴吹，我吸足了氣猛的吹，又顯着氣緩緩吹。可是笛兒總歸默然。我開始忿怒—準是那老頭驅人。</p>
<p>於是，我復在黃昏的待頭上追着了他。我激起動地說：</p>
<p>「你騙人，只有你那支笛兒會　！」</p>
<p>他不答，慢慢將我那支按在唇邊；每一支笛兒都響曉，我那支果然同他的一樣能動人。</p>
<p>我感到羞辱。我取回我的笛兒，回到斗室中，在暮色裏撮着口吹，又尖起嘴吹；我吸足了氣猛的吹，又順着氣緩緩吹，—我沒再去麻煩老頭兒。</p>
<p>等我學會了笛兒，人們開始爲着我的笛聲不安的時候，賣笛兒胡琴的老頭兒不再在黃昏的梅頭上出現了。</p>
<p>在暮色裏我吹着，我將嘹曉的笛聲搏動向少男少女的鼓膜……人開始瘦弱了，人萎枯了！老祖母的話確是實情。終於我病了，在暮色裏我但聽見誰的笛聲在激盪着。</p>
<p>我摸撫着我的笛兒，難道這　能吸監笛手的心血？</p>
<h3 id="c41">梨花海棠 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 淑芳</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>月　迎着太陽，在窗前織絨綫，校役推門進來，遞給她一張請柬，她接過來一看，上面的署名是：辛晚成。</p>
<p>她很快的喚起了個記憶，上星期在校長五十誕辰那天，給介紹的一個富商，就是那個很注意她的老頭子，並不太老，但是也近五十歲了。</p>
<p>免不了有些奇怪，才見過一次面，就下帖子請她，想着自己笑了起來，多個哪！倒是一個好機會，說不定這一下子可以實現了，她多年來的夢—辦一個孤兒院—她很愉快地把那張請柬放到抽屜裏。</p>
<p>第二天她循着地址去赴宴，撳了門鈴，一個僕人恭敬地領她到會客室裏，怪得很靜悄地一個人也沒有，那間會客室放着一套莊嚴而笨重的紅木紅傢俱，栗　邑的地毯，栗　色的沙發，栗殼色的窗窗帘，屋子裏沒有陽光，角落裏佈滿着陰影，月姮不自然地打了寒噤，「陰森」「肅殺」等字樣，像肥皂泡一樣地在腦子裏升起來。</p>
<p>她吃了晚飯才回學校神情有些興奮，仝住的碧和輝，問她上那裏去的，這麽晚才回來，月姮微笑着伸出了一隻手，手指上正套着一只呌人看了眼花撩亂的鑽戒，碧和輝吃了一驚，更迫切地問她是怎麼一回事。</p>
<p>「我快訂婚了，和那個華僑富商辛晚成。兩星期後就請你們吃訂婚酒」。月姮平淡而又輕鬆的說。</p>
<p>提起辛晚成，碧和輝也在校長生日那天見過一面，那人面目雖未必可憎，但看上去有點怪僻，並且聽說是很吝嗇的，那麼有錢，從來也沒捐過一個子，校長好像說過，她是死去了太太才變成這樣的，根據這些碧很利害地勸月姮，對自己的終身大事不要太疏忽了，二人年紀相差得這麼遠不會有幸福的，况且這樣的訂婚，也太奇突太快，但月姮却說，辛晚成答應她拿出錢來給她辦孤兒院，多年的心願已經得　了，就是犧牲了終身幸福，是無有謂的。</p>
<p>訂過婚，月姮一步也不放鬆的催促晚成籌備孤兒院的事，晚成奔走着，替她頂房子買用具。聘請了許多人幫着籌備各種事宜，終於三個月後孤兒院正式開辦了，月如榮任院長，碧和輝做她的左右手，執掌着重要事務，起先孤兒院並不多，後來人數漸漸增多起來，大有欣欣向榮的氣慨，就在這時晚成提出了結婚的要求，月姮和訂婚時一貫作風毫不猶疑地答應下來。</p>
<p>剛忙好孤兒院的事，又忙着結婚，月姮覺得自己瘦了許多，但是一個天生美的人，瘦也好，胖也好，總是美的，胖了些，人家說是「豐腴」「飽滿」，瘦了些「楚楚憐人」「不勝羅綺」等形容詞，却更動聽了，現在月姮瘦了晚成說她比從前更嫵媚更來得惹人愛憐。</p>
<p>結婚的前晚，月姮心裏有些悵惘，明天就要嫁給一個年紀比她大一倍的人了，種種地方，她和晚成不相稱，不調和，她自己並不是不知道，祗是太熱心於事業了，直到今天妤像才有工夫給她想一想，碧說過，她和晚成結婚正合了「一樹梨花壓海棠」的那句詩，她想明天一定每個人都有這種感覺的，她傷心地流下了眼淚。</p>
<p>第二天，月姮打扮成像一個仙子，她滿耳都聽見讚美的話，晚成也喜氣洋洋地忙着，給朋友們戲謔得臉上紅一陣白一陣的，月姮裝着很偷快的樣子，她想，她是現在喜劇的中心，還是將來悲劇的主角。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>爲了月姮不喜歡那屋子裏陰沉沉毫無生氣的樣子，晚成新購進一堂柚木傢具，換上五彩的地毯，和綠色的窗帘，新房子更是五色繽紛，叫人眩目，月姮生性愛花，現在這所住宅裏，東也是一瓶花，西也是一瓶花，的確有生氣多了。</p>
<p>過去晚成是這座皇宮裏的皇帝，現在月姮是皇后，她的威權更在皇帝之上，連皇帝都得遷就她，兩星期很快地過去，月姮優閒得有點發膩，她決定每天上孤兒院去辦事。</p>
<p>婚後的生沽，多半是平靜而迷糊的，把一切都　在腦後不去想它，集中力量在孤兒院事業上。她每天看孩子念書，遊戲和休息，她覺得有無上的愉快。</p>
<p>這些日子以來，他們倆簡直不談私人的事，像是撩天，談起來東一句西一句無聊得發窘，月姮是存心冷漠，而晚成還是跟沒結婚一樣，月姮一點也不關心，他不過咀嚼着單　的滋味而已。</p>
<p>月姮有一種壞脾氣那就是「明知故犯」，許多事情她都這樣做了，她老是想改，老是改不掉，就像現在，她明知晚成是非常愛她的，祇要她拿出一分愛來，就能得十倍的收穫，但是她偏不肯這麼做，自己也說不出什麼理由，直到她過生日的時候，恰巧晚成身體有些不舒適，但他還打起精神爲她請客，一淸早就起來，花費半個多鐘頭自己剃鬚子，他沒有忘記自己的缺點，極力地掩飾，以博得月姮的歡心，月姮在很感動的心境下，當天早晨，也到理髮店理去把捲曲着的長髪梳成一個　，於是她們間情感上灰色的靈　，　着鬍子和頭髮的力量揭開了，露出渾浩的月光來。</p>
<p>賓客散盡後，屋子裏剩下了他們兩個人，月姮意識到自己的錯誤，更不願一誤再誤，她旣能愛天下的孤兒，難道反不能愛她的丈夫，她想她不應該　　　二十多年的晚成，再在　的　　下被　一次，她決定以後好好地愛他</p>
<p>就在那資小病中，月姮很　　地服侍他，病愈後，對他的飲食起居都　自照料，無形中改好了晚成對僕人們　　的脾氣，不用說晚成自是感激非常了！人家說結婚是戀愛的墳墓，而他們却在結婚半年以後方才開始戀愛。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>除夕，屋子裏怖置得煥然一新，天下着雪，氣候着實很冷，晚飯後，月姮和晚成圍着　子烘火，他們計劃着明年的事情，明年將給他們帶來一個小寶寶，一想到他們快做父親和母親了，臉上都露出笑容，月姮計劃孤兒院中，明年要添一科手藝工作，使孤兒們有練習工作的機會，晚成預備明年要在事業上好好地努力一下，因爲他將有孩子了，孩子還小得很呢！</p>
<p>儘管外面是北風怒吼，大雪紛飛，他們却在冬天裏過着春天的生活，本來晚成是自私的，暴戾的，吝嗇的，因爲他孤獨無人關心，沒有人生樂趣，就妒嫉人家快樂，對手下的人，發脾氣，惡聲　罵，他得不到人家的同情，他也不憐憫人家，他不肯拿出一個錢來做好事，月姮呢，自私是不必說，遇事無誠意，明知故犯的壞脾氣都很明顯的暴露着，可是現在他們都變得良善了，晚成被月姮熱心於孤兒院事所感動而放棄了吝嗇，月姮因晚成的戀愛而對結婚獻出誠意，他們在愛的濡染裏把自己的缺點糾正過來。</p>
<p>「眞情」和「摯愛」是兩條溫泉，他能洗滌你的創痛，能鼓勵你上進，更能澄淸不良的渣滓，現在晚成和月姮這一對老夫少妻，外表看來縱然是不調和，不相稱，但是誰能說他們是不幸福呢。</p>
<h3 id="c42">痕跡及其他 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 王書</p>
<p>痕跡</p>
<p>都是靑年伙伴，隔了幾年的飄零，有機會相聚，訴說着別情，實是難得的，握着熱烈的手，我就發覺了他手指頭火黃焦燻的痕跡，此無他，是多吸香烟的緣故。驚奇他的變異，我天眞的問他：</p>
<p>「怎麼使　染上了這習慣的？」</p>
<p>他却不立即回答，反捉起我的手，找得了指頭與他同樣的痕跡，那顯著被烟蒂長期的殘燼灸灼的痕跡，暴露無遺了。</p>
<p>兩條悵惘與慚惡的視綫交織成了一個世事滄海的愈　。露出一絲慘淡的微笑，默默的無語。兩個大概都在嘆息着：這激盪萬變的時代波　中，是一個靑年人的磨鍊罷。</p>
<p>白髮</p>
<p>這番，又是我新的發現，朋友的不修飾的頭髮　邊，明顯的添上了無數根白髮。以前的活潑玲琍的「小雀兒」，竟是如此的，變成「白頭翁」了嗎？</p>
<p>白變，該是蒼老的象徵，但他明明尙是在讀書的學子，據一般的想像，該是一個靑年人的黃金華年，靑春朝氣，惹人羨慕嫉妬的時候。</p>
<p>現在，朋友却自己對着鏡子，就那架着黑　眼鏡的枯澀的臉龐，撫摩那斑斑白髮，亦祗低低的喃語：「算不得一回事，世間誰能免得了坎坷，誰能抵禦得住疲勞與衰頹？若說人家的靑年是春天，那未春天在我已遠去了，祗剩我暮秋的蒼楚的心情了。」</p>
<p>「爲什麼說這種頹廢的話，　還年靑，您的精神尙在孕育中間，光芒燦爛的大時代，還在向您招手，何必自　？還是跳出這沉悶的個人圈子，屋外總有陽光可使　恢復靑春的。」</p>
<p>一個沉毅的聲音在告訴他，亦同樣的在告訴我，這聲音却不知道是我的，還是他的。</p>
<p>總之，他頷首着，伸出熱情的手，交換我對他的鼓勵的，是一股依然如火如荼的力量。</p>
<p>春天</p>
<p>還是躑躅在街頭，領略那降臨未久的春的季節罷。</p>
<p>緩緩的踱步，難得的和煦的陽光，拖出了我們的影子，春風吹來柔和的情緻，舒暢了我們的呼吸，仰望那淸澄的蔚藍的天空，不用言語，也增强了我們新生的希望。</p>
<p>路口，我們暫告分別，再一次的握緊我們依　的手，我指着枝頭萌茁的新芽，吐着綠意的街樹，還是誠虔的祝福着：</p>
<p>「春風裏，帶一顆春天的心給您，趕去那　折的悲憤的秋意，這正是時候了！」</p>

<h3 id="c43">國際盃足球賽　貢獻中華隊當局 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>本屆國際盃足球賽，報名加入者，計有七單位。爲中華·意大利·日本·葡蔔牙·猶太·北歐·俄國。已經比賽者，爲北歐勝俄國，一對〇。意大利三對一勝日本，而昨日葡蔔牙則以二對一勝猶太，茲光列形勢表：</p>
<p>最近形勞</p>
<p>評述昨日戰情葡勝猶佬之役</p>
<p>昨日下午三時半有一幕，爲葡萄牙戰猶太。前者在聯賽中傲視羣雄。唯在此國際盃中，則以福恩潘脫遜等皆歸北歐，鮑休脫·柯萊脫等亦在國籍關係，未能參加。故實力遠非聯賽中之葡商可比。猶太本中庸之輩，原無問鼎之希望。但該隊精神殊佳，置勝負於腦後，亦値得一提者也。兩　陣容如后：</p>
<p>葡萄牙雖實力較遜，但對猶太之可獲勝，早在意料之中。故開賽後，似不見十分賣力。詎料猶太奮發有爲，咄咄逼人，攻勢固不多，守來却見頭頭是適，葡隊不得不振作精神，乃見氣象一變，葛屈里年少有爲，乘m格林堡亂路露空隙之機會，長驅直入同，不負使命，奪得首城，猶太失陷後，毫無氣餒，一鼓作氣。S格林堡右路興兵，立即還以顏色，扳成平手。嗣後局勢。全在拉鋸情形，猶太盡力之至，葡隊亦無可奈何，直至四十分鐘時，羅柴遼得奧列維拉之接濟，單騎直入，至近門十五處槙掃一脚，殊見功夫。裝置勃孟束乎無策葡隊再以二對一超出，亦即此實貴之一球，奠定勝利。上半時二對一結束。下半時葡隊抱穩勝雄心，節節進　，V蘇君之屢放冷箭，神出鬼沒，猶太有不屈精神，嚴加防守。蓋勃孟　救險球，功不可抹，故至終塲，　　仍各無所得。葡萄牙終得以二對一勝猶太，將與北歐爭奪決賽權。而另一組中華與意大，亦相逢於爭決賽　中。日後各國出奇制勝，奪取有關國際榮譽之國際盃，必呈熱烈之情况，發揮最上之球藝，以　我球迷之眼福。</p>
<p>預測以後形勢必爲中意之爭</p>
<p>觀各隊實力，自以中意爲最具希望。蓋葡隊陣容，究欠强硬。北歐以德商爲主，並有福恩w潘脫遜之助陣，陣容方面尙屬可人。唯頗覺其聯絡尙難盡如人意耳。與葡隊相逢時，可稱旗鼓相當，唯與中華或意大利決賽時，似必難以倖免。依此而論，中意之半決賽時，亦可謂決賽，兩隊相爭前，想必均應有所籌劃。</p>
<p>希望中華當局亟應未雨綢繆</p>
<p>溯之過去，凡中華隊，逢國際盃賽，必及早成立，加以演習。唯邇來筆者總覺其僅「明星制」以聲名較盛者，拔選成軍，但事前決無待習，乃至比賽時，雜入一直起，勝　固又一事，要求有　理想之戰績，我未之見也。於是不得不希望中華隊以次此亟應未雨綢繆，多加訓練，　幾　時有克敵　　之成功，爲我中華隊　　也。况此次　將如　幼良韓龍海李　　　祥均在無出席中華資格之列，捐失甚大。茲敢　此時　，再　　　選　　陣容，亦爲對付意大利應取者。</p>
<p>守門應取二人，　可各踢半塲。萬一上半時情形尙佳，則不調亦可。後衛莊友仁近况殊好，當可勝任，而陳效　亦有最正常之鍛鍊，必可孚人之望。中衛綫朱靈聖與李天生同居左路，可望有　默，孟義良張林根俱有翅然情形，前鋒既以左右　缺乏，不得不　重許文奎費春華，劉　儒及　麟，中有　麟　策　，而左右兩鋒，李義巨與孫錦　富有拉門脚頭，相映成輝。收獲必有可觀者。　見如斯，尙希當局加以採納而再改進之，毋令有關國際榮譽之　盃，眼看胡兒攫去，則球界幸甚。（心）</p>
<h3 id="c44">汕隊成立三週紀念　精彩籃球友宜賽 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>汕頭同鄕會爲慶祝汕隊籃球成立三週紀念，特於昨日下午七時起，假八仙橋靑年會邊請中北及胖隊兩隊與汕隊甲乙組分別作友誼賽，節目可稱精彩。又以籃球好戲，停頓已久，華聯中北之決勝戰，未有確實日期，球迷値此良機，莫不想前去欣賞。惟以此次表演賽，汕隊方面純爲招待同鄕，藉以喚起同鄕之注意業餘運動，意至深長，但對無數熱心球迷，自覺抱憾矣。昨球塲四週，滿坑滿谷，林作詩之一番苦心，得以償矣，無怪其滿臉春風，得意洋洋。提介體育，有如成績値屬値得佩服，兩塲戰略如左：</p>
<p>胖隊勝汕隊乙　三五——二三</p>
<p>中北和汕隊甲　二七——二七</p>
<p>汕乙失敗之因過於謹愼所致</p>
<p>汕乙之敗，全在過於謹愼，得球旣不敢用高速度進攻，此乃求勝心過切。而守衛仍　用五人聯防，較爲落伍。胖隊邇來球藝殊見進步，中鋒王榮生不愧後起，一日千里，實爲可造之材。其唯一之缺點，爲轉身尙嫌太慢耳。小胖子嚴又　生龍活虎，演出頗博好評，胖隊之勝，絕無倖致。結果上半時爲二十一對十三，總結果三十五對二十三，均胖隊領先。</p>
<p>中北和汕隊甲極盡聯歡目的</p>
<p>中北與汕隊甲之戰，觀衆精神爲之一振。中北以沈　恭足傷未愈，由新自北來之名將尹煥文加入助陣，仍見整齊。上塲之初，雙方均用人針人，汕隊賴精神之足，一氣呵成九分，中北一無所得。視各隊員稍有力不逮之象，此時中北突改五人聯防，以逸待勞。汕隊不知如何，亦改用五人聯防，致投中北所好，遂爲李震中頻頻　進妙射。上半時中北終以十七對十二反敗爲勝。下半時汕隊竭力反　攻，且觀察上半時最大之錯誤點，爲以杜維聰試後衛，前鋒獲分少將，下半時林一易前綫，固予中北之威脅力甚强，節節追上。最後二三分鐘時，汕隊竟以二七對二五超出，中北幸賴陳學崇之最後一擲，造成各二七平手，握手言和。</p>
<p>綜論此塲大賽，因　友誼性質，故雙方極能在球藝方面，儘量發揮，允使無數球　，獲得最佳之印象，誠堪贊道。</p>
<p>塲畔一覽</p>
<p>金伯陶自華聯汕隊之役，受人指責後，引咎自退，久未見其執行裁判，昨又出現，頗覺精神奕奕，不失爲一上進之籃球裁判。</p>
<p>昨觀衆除汕頭同鄕外，籃球界同志甚多，有陳作良，陳榴珍，吳子彬，黃明媛，張錦瓏等。</p>
<p>汕頭同鄕喝彩聲之烈，得未曾有。</p>
<p>塲上秩序，全由汕隊負責，極見井然。（溲）</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, during its regular cabinet meeting on the 23rd, seconded the plan to organize a volunteer service corps (tentatively named). After an explanation by the Director of the Integrated Planning Bureau, Mr. Uematsu, it was passed. Specific measures will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the preparation for total national mobilization, the Japanese government is rapidly proceeding with various legislative and administrative measures. On the 23rd, a decision was made at a regular cabinet meeting. The Information Bureau released the following content on the 24th: The government, in light of the current situation, aims to unify defense and production and to create a system of total mobilization under the pressure of war. A National Volunteer Corps will be organized to step forward. Details are as follows: The missions of the National Volunteer Corps are as follows: (1) Air defense and defense, food production increase, and other temporary urgent tasks. (2) Constructing fortifications, transporting and supplying weapons, ammunition, and provisions to assist the operations of the Army and Navy. (3) The National Volunteer Corps will be organized by institutions, companies, factories, workplaces, etc., with a relatively large number of personnel, based on geographical divisions. Other industrial sites, etc., will be organized independently according to their respective regions. (4) When the National Volunteer Corps assists in military operations, it will be under the command of the commanders of the Army and Navy units.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Prime Minister Koiso Encourages the Nation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso addressed the hundred million citizens as follows: "The enemy, America, has broken into our front gate. This is a great calamity unprecedented in history. The current situation can be described as the juncture of the Empire's survival. Therefore, the total mobilization of our compatriots is also today. Based on the principle of military and agriculture as one, and all citizens as soldiers, the hundred million citizens should arm themselves to defend the divine land to complete the great task of the eternal and boundless Empire. To break this critical war situation, we can only rely on the inherent strength of our country's thousands of years of tradition. Therefore, unless the nation unites to strike the enemy, there is no better solution. The government has decided to organize a National Volunteer Corps and adopt measures to strengthen defense and increase production based on the principle of serving the country with our lives. At the same time, in an environment of urgent circumstances, we are prepared to take up arms to kill the enemy and defend our homeland. Through this organization, all citizens stand as one to carry out the war, serve the country with their lives, and establish a system of certain victory. Of course, defending the homeland is not just about taking up arms to kill the enemy. We should also redouble our efforts in military production, food production, transportation, and other rear-area tasks. The effects gained in defending the homeland in this way are also significant. As long as the entire nation steps forward to complete the country's urgent tasks, no enemy is to be feared, and great combat power and strong defense capabilities can be generated. I have great faith in the steadfast spirit of the people to overcome this difficult situation. If the entire nation contributes all its abilities to the country to the maximum extent, it can fulfill the mission of protecting the Empire. In short, all hundred million compatriots, regardless of gender or age, should unite and be members of the defense, sacrifice personal interests, engage in production, and bear the heavy responsibility of defense to eliminate selfishness and serve the public, and then the combat power of certain victory will be enhanced, and the road to victory can be expected soon."</p>
<h3 id="e3">If the Enemy Attacks Again, We Will Surely Deal a Head-On Blow: Director Kurihara's Statement <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Navy Press Department Director Kurihara, after the announcement of war results by the Imperial Headquarters on the 23rd, issued the following statement: "The Japanese military's strike on the enemy's mobile task force was extremely significant. This result was bestowed by the Emperor and the result of the brave fighting of the front-line soldiers. I am grateful beyond words. From the perspective of modern warfare, it can also be said to be the result of the total power of one hundred million citizens. However, the enemy mobile task force that attacked today is not the enemy's full strength, and although the strike we inflicted on the enemy was significant, it was not decisive. Judging from the current situation, the enemy will attack again in the future. If the enemy attacks, we can only unleash the total power of one hundred million people to deal the enemy a major blow. Currently, the morale of the front-line soldiers is high, from the highest commander to the lowest soldier, all are fully capable of seizing the opportunity to deal the enemy a head-on blow."</p>
<p>Comparable to the Taiwan Sea Battle Results</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The enemy mobile task force that appeared in the southeastern sea area of Kyushu was subject to a preemptive attack by Japanese special attack units and air forces, and then continuous strong attacks day and night for four days, achieving significant results, which have been separately announced by the Imperial Headquarters. Unconfirmed results are still a significant number and are not included. The enemy mobile task force that attacked this time was composed mainly of several aircraft carriers, with considerable strength. However, by the time the enemy mobile task force began to retreat on the 21st, the number had dwindled, which shows that the war results achieved by the Japanese side were actually beyond the scope of the announcement. In fact, the majority of its forces have already been annihilated. On the one hand, approximately 180 enemy aircraft were shot down, which does not include carrier-based aircraft carried by aircraft carriers. Therefore, the number of enemy aircraft that shared their fate with the aircraft carriers must be numerous, needless to say. The results achieved this time in sinking five regular aircraft carriers are comparable to the results of the Taiwan Sea air battle last autumn, and it is a head-on blow to the enemy's reckless attempt to approach the mainland.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Enemy Carrier Aircraft Continuously Attacking Okinawa <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – An enemy mobile task force appeared in the southern waters of the Japanese mainland on the 23rd, and again at dusk. Approximately 230 enemy carrier aircraft attacked the Okinawa area. On the 24th, carrier aircraft continued to attack the area again from around 7:00 AM.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of Munitions has designated March to June as the period of abundant water volume. In order to supply the current needed by important industrial sectors and enhance combat power, it recently formulated the "Showa 20th Fiscal Year Increased Production Plan for Self-Generated Current During the Abundant Water Volume Period," specifying important industrial factories to concentrate on consuming residual current. Recently, the water conditions have reached a record high. If abundant hydropower can be sent to various places, it can save important strategic resources such as coal, gas, and other fuels.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Based on the Three Major National Policies at the Time of Returning the Capital: Seeking Survival in Struggle: President Chen's Instructions to Personnel of Various Institutions in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) – During his inspection of resistance efforts, President Chen gave instructions to the working personnel of Zhejiang Province's institutions. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Governor Xiang, fellow comrades, I am here in Hangzhou today for inspection. After inspecting the party, government, and military institutions, and listening to the reports of various leaders, I am now talking to you all, and I feel very gratified.</p>
<p>It is only a few days away from the fifth anniversary of the return of the national government to the capital. Today, I will simply talk to you about the national government's policies and the direction of future efforts.</p>
<p>. The National Government's Policies Remain Unchanged.</p>
<p>The situation is now very urgent. Let us recall the national policies of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building that Mr. Wang Jingwei revealed five years ago. In simple terms, the content of these three principles is to take peace to obtain China's freedom, to use anti-communism to achieve China's unification, and to use nation-building to consolidate China's independence. These three principles have not changed to this day, and will not change in the future until the completion of China's freedom, unification, and independence, and then undertaking the task of East Asian construction.</p>
<p>In the five years since the return of the National Government to the capital, comrades have worked hard to strive for these three major goals and have achieved considerable success. This is something to be proud of. Do not be discouraged by the fact that it has not yet been completed. If there had been no such five years of effort since the return to the capital, what would China look like today? The vitality of the regions, the people's perception, and the consolidation of the national foundation would not have the situation they have today. Although there are still many things that have not been fully realized, for example: the alliance treaty has been established, concessions have been recovered, and unequal treaties have been abolished. This has been the desire of China for a hundred years since the Opium War, but because full peace has not yet been achieved, the troop withdrawal issue in the alliance treaty has not been implemented, which is a great pity. However, the efforts of comrades in the central and local governments in the past have created today's situation, which is very glorious and a great achievement. We must not belittle ourselves. We must understand our position, recognize the value of our efforts, cater to the urgent situation, and strive for China's freedom, unification, and independence.</p>
<p>. The Direction of Future Efforts.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to talk about the direction of future efforts. How should we proceed? We still need to be based on the three major national policies at the time of the return to the capital, seeking survival in the old struggle. The method of struggle:</p>
<p>First, we must rebuild the Kuomintang. This time, I am also serving as the Minister of the Central Organization Department, and I want to improve the party's organization. In the past, we advocated the unification of party, government, and military, because the party is an organization with doctrines, and politics and military affairs are the means to implement the doctrines. If the party's organization is empty, the government and military cannot cooperate, and the party will not have power. Although there are political programs, politics and military affairs will be separated. Since the Kuomintang stopped electing and appointing representatives, it has been unhealthy, becoming a dysfunctional organization, divided into personal factions, citing private individuals, resulting in a disintegrated organization that cannot command politics and military affairs. Now we must reorganize the divided party, knowing only the comrades of the party and not the private individuals. Therefore, we are now conducting elections, establishing the party's headquarters, and jointly participating in the organization. Only with unity can there be strength, can we command politics and the military, and can we complete peace, anti-communism, and nation-building.</p>
<p>Second, the Communist Party is now very rampant. The New Fourth Army is causing trouble everywhere. Communism is the Soviet Union without a motherland, which is an organization without a motherland. Now that the war is getting longer, the Communist Party is expanding even faster. Anti-communism is our highest principle. To unify China and stabilize people's livelihood, we must be anti-communist.</p>
<p>. Seeking Liberation, Independence, and Freedom.</p>
<p>Third, our country's participation in the war is voluntary and is not influenced by other countries' attitudes, because for a hundred years, British and American imperialism has reduced China to a semi-colony, resources have been plundered, and the people have been enslaved. To seek liberation, we must wage war against the imperialists. Even if our strength is weak, as long as our will is strong, our participation in the war is to overthrow British and American imperialism. We must wage war against all imperialists who have reduced China to a colony. Even if Britain and the United States land in China, our policies will not change. We will fight them to the end. Even if we fail, there will be our second generation and third generation. We cannot seek liberation, independence, and freedom without such a decisive battle.</p>
<p>Fourth, since the return to the capital, I have repeatedly said that the country is built on the people. The survival and development of the country depend entirely on the efforts of all our people. No country can be independent and autonomous by relying on other countries. To revitalize China, we must rely on ourselves. Many people believe that there is no hope for the future, living one day at a time, without invigorating their spirits, nor working for the country. Therefore, there are few achievements in revitalization. When we were young, we looked at history and saw that Fan Zhongyan often took 'the world as his responsibility,' which means that even ordinary people must have a sense of responsibility to the country. Now there are very few people with such a will, wandering around all day long. We must understand that we have policies and doctrines. In such an urgent situation, there is much that can be done. Each of our units, each of our individuals, must unite wholeheartedly to overcome difficulties and overcome the difficulties of the times. The central government and the local governments trust each other and work together for the country.</p>
<p>Comrades, we must understand the national government's policies and how to do things in the future, muster up our courage, and invigorate our spirits. There is great hope for China's future."</p>

<h3 id="e7">War and Crime <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— Omori Hirota</p>
<p>"Punishment is the hope of no punishment," this well-known saying is difficult to realize as an ideal, but all those who administer justice always take this as the highest goal. Hoping for a reduction in crime is a sincere prayer in any era, but in today's unprecedented war, before defeating the current stubborn enemy, in order to win victory, eliminating criminal behavior as much as possible is a major event that everyone agrees on. If there are criminals, in addition to implementing numerous procedures such as prosecution, trial, and execution, they also give people an uneasy feeling. Now is the time to mobilize the total strength of the nation and dedicate everything for the purpose of certain victory. Isn't it despicable to waste time and effort due to crime?</p>
<p>The current security situation in Japan is the most stable among the warring countries, especially compared to the enemies Britain and the United States, there is a huge difference. There are too many examples to mention, but consider that the virginity of Japanese women can be called the best in the world. In contrast, the education of women in Britain and the United States is very poor, so in the rear, concerning the issue of virginity, ugly things are fully exposed, and the inability of Britain and the United States to win will also sow the seeds here. This war, Japan achieved a great victory, on the one hand, it can also be said to be the victory of chastity, this glory of Japanese women will be immortalized in history. In addition, enemy countries' wartime thefts in factories have increased without end. We can imagine that their losses are astonishing, because Britain has had a particularly high number of thieves for a long time. Of course, there are many people who only see the gentlemanly facade of the British and do not know the internal truth, but to be honest, the British are indeed rich in thieving habits. British maids do not steal valuable items from their masters, this is almost never seen. So the most painstaking thing for housewives every day is to be wary of servants. The ancient British records of theft and robbery are really full of pages and endless. In its legal history, what everyone knows is that Britain's decision on the punishment for theft is very strict. Stealing more than five shillings (worth 2.50 yen in today's currency), outdoor robberies, stable horse thieves, and fish thieves in fish ponds were all sentenced to death. This law was enforced for a long time, and it was still implemented even after entering modern times. The very existence of this long-term effective explicit provision, without looking at the number of actual reports, can clearly understand that there are a lot of British thieves. As for the United States, it has long been known as a famous criminal country and a source of evil, which is by no means a groundless accusation. The number of those who have been sentenced accounts for a very large proportion of the total population, far exceeding that of other countries. In addition, the incompetence of the judicial police, the antics of political parties, the arrogance of financial groups, and the opposition between political clans have all become major obstacles to eliminating criminal behavior. The criminals who are shamelessly exempt from the law are known to people all over the world, and in cities they are like carp crossing the river. It was already like this before the war, so in wartime, when life is getting harder, the endless emergence of crimes inside the United States, the shake-up of security, and the embarrassment of the authorities can be imagined.</p>
<p>When two countries use total power against each other, needless to say, the first to meet face-to-face is naturally war. But in addition to military warfare, there is also economic warfare, ideological warfare, and a competitive war to maintain domestic security. To achieve victory, it is necessary to maintain security at a high level with an orderly attitude. A country that can maintain security at a high level is a country that is likely to win. Therefore, as mentioned above, the current security situation in Japan is far better than other countries, but in order to strengthen the firm belief in certain victory, domestic security must be further improved. This means that security should be stable and continue to seek stability, preventing crime before it happens with a bold and careful spirit. Therefore, I respectfully present my humble opinion to the people of the whole country, hoping to encourage each other.</p>
<p>First, do not be misled by rumors and gossip. The longer the war lasts, the easier rumors and gossip become. Even people who are slightly rational may sometimes be deceived by baseless rumors. The enemy Britain and the United States were good at spreading rumors in the last World War. Now, of course, they will still use all their schemes to deal with Japan. The most important thing for the Japanese people is to firmly believe in their beliefs, not to give the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of, and to build a solid Great Wall of psychology to prevent rumors and gossip.</p>
<p>Second, do not abandon yourself in daily life. It is appropriate that life is difficult in such an earth-shattering war. However, recalling the past, our daily life was too luxurious. It would be a big mistake to only be obsessed with the past extravagance and be dissatisfied with today's simple clothes and food. Enduring hardship is also the way to win victory.</p>
<p>Third, you must be open and honest with each other. To unite sincerely and face the outside world together requires internal harmony. In other words, the open and honest and unquestioned opinions in the rear are indispensable elements for winning victory. Enduring suffering together with composure will lead to the bright and brilliant victory in the near future. A chaotic mind will contribute to the crime's stronghold, so it is most necessary to guard against.</p>
<p>Although the above three battles are the most ordinary clichés, they are of great significance in preventing criminal behavior in war. Please think twice about it.</p>

<h3 id="e9">The People Seek Ways to Save the Country Based on Spontaneous Enthusiasm: The People's Representative Conference Is of Great Significance <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Since the people of all walks of life in the capital have been worried about the times and suggested that a wartime people's representative conference be convened in various provinces and cities, in order to jointly study national affairs and provide the government with adoption, after the release of this suggestion, the people in various provinces and cities across the country responded enthusiastically with spontaneous enthusiasm, and immediately elected representatives to prepare to attend the meeting. The preparations are now actively underway, and the meeting is scheduled to open in Beijing for three consecutive days from the 28th. At the time of the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, this epoch-making meeting in the history of our people's movement is of great significance. The convening of this conference is purely out of the people's awareness, because the country has the responsibility to protect the people, and the people have the obligation to defend the country. At this extraordinary juncture, the people, in order to take responsibility for the country, and the appeal of their own suffering, rise up in time, and work together to accomplish great things, which is indeed an unshirkable duty. We deeply know that the Greater East Asia War is the last war for the liberation of East Asia. The solution to the Chinese problem and the liberation of the Chinese nation can only be obtained in the Greater East Asia Liberation War. Today, the people can deeply understand the significance of the Greater East Asia War, promote the determination to fight the war, and seek solutions to the Chinese problem based on spontaneous enthusiasm. Therefore, the government authorities have high expectations for this meeting. The representatives of various provinces and cities are all people of high social standing. It is deeply believed that they will be able to understand the difficulties of the times, study carefully, contribute all that they have, and live up to the trust of the people and the expectations of the government. Here we have to say that the problem of China's unification has become increasingly urgent, because the division of power does not help the difficult times internally, and does not seek the way of independent autonomy externally. Therefore, how to promote the realization of national unification is an urgent matter. Also, since the beginning of history, external aggression and internal troubles have stemmed from political corruption. Today, the government is already fully promoting clean politics, but it still needs the assistance and supervision of the people to complete the task of eliminating corruption and building the country.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Promoting the Qingxiang Work to Ensure Local Security: Director Su Reports at the Regular Press Conference <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The ninth regular press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Department was held in Room 139 of the City Government on the afternoon of the 24th. Director Su Chengde of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau attended to answer various questions raised by reporters from various newspapers regarding the Qingxiang work. After the Q&amp;A session, reporters from various newspapers raised discussions on the poor conditions of blockade management in various places, which Mr. Su explained one by one. The details of the Q&amp;A are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Policy Guidelines: (1) (Question) What are the current policy guidelines of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau?</p>
<p>(Answer) Qingxiang is a national policy of the government. The current policy guidelines of this bureau are to firmly grasp the good security in the areas that have already been Qingxiang, and further ensure that the local security is effectively guaranteed and becomes more consolidated. For areas where the security situation is poor, the Qingxiang work will be resolutely implemented within this year. Regarding this point, there is already a considerable plan, which will be realized soon. As the Greater East Asia War is approaching the decisive stage, the war effort is becoming more and more important, and the establishment of local security is a prerequisite for increasing production. Therefore, the Qingxiang work is already a part of winning the Greater East Asia War. This bureau can only abide by the national policy and strive to complete our mission under the leadership of the mayor.</p>
<p>(2) (Question) It has been a long time since the end of the third phase of the Qingxiang work in Shanghai. However, it has been found that there are still a few areas that have not undergone the Qingxiang work. What are your plans?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding this point, it has been briefly mentioned above. The selection and detailed plan content of the Qingxiang areas in this phase cannot be disclosed to the public at present.</p>
<p>Scope of Work: (3) (Question) The task of the blockade offices in various places where the Qingxiang work is carried out is all the responsibility of the Qingxiang Bureau, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the Qingxiang work. Why is the work of the blockade office in this city established independently?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Blockade Management Office of this city used to be under the jurisdiction of this bureau. Since February of this year, it has been ordered to be directly under the municipal government. Recently, in order to simplify the administrative structure, the municipal government ordered it to be transferred to the Security Command and set up a blockade section. This kind of structural and affiliation change does not affect the promotion of Qingxiang work. The scope of Qingxiang work includes various affairs such as economic blockade. This bureau has the responsibility to plan and deliberate on the above-mentioned various affairs, regardless of how the funds are allocated.</p>
<p>(4) (Question) What is the progress of the political work task of the Qingxiang work in this city?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding the organization of political work groups, this bureau was previously ordered by the municipal government to forward the organizational rules of the Qingxiang political work groups in various provinces and cities issued by the Executive Yuan, ordering compliance with them in order to promote the Qingxiang work. After detailed research and discussion, we are ready to start drafting various organizations and budget estimates, which have now been completed and will be submitted to the government for approval soon.</p>
<p>(5) (Question) The Qingxiang work in this city has been completed, but why have the blockade points in various places not been removed? What is the reason?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding the existence or abolition of the blockade lines and inspection stations in the Qingxiang areas, it is an entire national issue, and the local authorities should implement it in accordance with the orders.</p>
<p>Eliminating Malpractices: (6) (Question) The obstacles of the blockade lines in various places have long been completely removed. The remaining blockade points seem to have lost the meaning of blockade. All the staff stationed at the blockade points are nothing more than collecting passage fees when materials pass through, which is simply equivalent to the previous "likin," engaging in disturbing the people. Does the authorities know this, and what are the measures to deal with it? Moreover, according to reports from various parties and the reporter's own eyes, at each blockade point, passage fees are openly demanded for non-contraband materials, such as 500 to 700 yuan per pig, otherwise they will deliberately make things difficult, and the people are miserable. On the contrary, if it is indeed contraband, it can still pass through as usual if passage fees are paid. Why does the Standing Committee turn a blind eye to this situation?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding the above-mentioned issue, the mayor mentioned the "improvement of the Blockade Management Office" at the plenary session of the Municipal Advisory Committee last month, saying that "the extortion of the people in the past was more than the likin in the past, with heavy exploitation and no standards. The villagers have grievances, but there is no way to complain. We originally planned to completely abolish the blockade, but the negotiations with the relevant parties have not yet been completed. Now we want to reduce the personnel of the blockade office to the lowest limit and increase their salaries, and strictly supervise them. If there are lawbreakers, they will be imprisoned if they are minor, and executed if they are serious, in order to reduce the suffering of the people." The municipal government has now ordered the Blockade Management Office to be transferred to the Security Command and set up a blockade section. At present, we can only follow the mayor's intention and work hard to eliminate the malpractices to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>

<p>The ten free elementary schools established by our office have finalized their locations through negotiation, and employment contracts are being issued to teachers. Enrollment will begin in the coming days. We are also collecting textbooks from all sectors because the students of the free schools are truly poor, out-of-school children. We plan to distribute the donated textbooks to the students to avoid increasing the burden on their parents. This is the true purpose of "free education." In the past few days, our office has received donations from Qicheng Elementary School (500 books), Ningbo Shanghai First Elementary School (1,700 books), Western District Higher Elementary School (over 600 books), Ningbo Shanghai Sixth Elementary School (500 books), Hua Guang Yi Elementary School (224 books), and Mr. Li Yanling (241 books). We express our deepest gratitude to the teachers and students of the schools that have donated textbooks. However, with an estimated total of over 1,000 students in the ten schools, the need for textbooks is still significant. We hope that people from all walks of life will continue to donate nationally designated textbooks for lower and higher grades in Mandarin Chinese, arithmetic, general knowledge, and senior Mandarin Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, nature, etc. Old or new, either is welcome. Books are the spiritual food of children. Those who donate books will find peace of mind, and those who benefit will be eternally grateful!</p>

<p>(1) Messrs. Bao Jiu, Ning Wu, Song Yu, Chen Jixiang, Li Qisheng, Lu Shirong, Gu Bingzhang, Tang Minfu, Zhu Yongkang, et al. wrote: "On March 25th, our dear friend Mr. Lü Qizhuang and Miss Hu Xingjue celebrated their engagement. We wanted to celebrate, but considering the current turbulent and difficult times, we dare not be extravagant. We have respectfully gathered 44,000 Central Reserve Bank notes and ask that they be donated in the name of Lü Qizhuang to the "Free School Fund" organized by your newspaper, 'Celebrating with Education.'"</p>
<p>(2) Students Yang Weiqi and Weimei wrote: "We have seen your newspaper's initiative for the Free School Fund and are very sympathetic. We are especially touched by the enthusiasm of many children to help. We are also two very fortunate elementary school students, and we think of how painful it must be for children who cannot afford to go to school. Therefore, this Free School Fund movement is truly needed and urgent! So we also want to do our part. Today is the anniversary of the untimely death of our third sister, Weichun. In remembrance and sorrow, we asked our parents to save the unconscious expenses and put together 5,000 National Currency dollars to donate to your newspaper's "Free School Fund" to commemorate our third sister Weichun. Although this small amount is not powerful, if everyone responds, it will be considerable!"</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Qi Weizhuan wrote: "My son Jinhua is studying at Hua Guang Free Elementary School at 284 Taikang Road. Yesterday, when he came home from school, he told me with great interest about the donation of money and books at his school in response to your newspaper's initiative to establish free elementary schools. After listening carefully, I was deeply moved. Because I was also a person who suffered greatly from being out of school when I was young. Because I could not read, I had to work as an old clerk in a rice store to barely maintain my life. And my son Jinhua had no one to take care of him. Fortunately, the old boss was kind and let Jinhua live in the store. But the problem of schooling was still unresolved. Fortunately, Hua Guang Free Elementary School specializes in accepting poor students and was able to enroll him for free.</p>
<p>But in Shanghai today, life is so difficult, and there are more than tens of millions of out-of-school children. Therefore, your newspaper's initiative to establish free schools is of great significance. Although my ability is weak, I would like to do my part and save 2,000 dollars from the breakfast money of me and Jinhua and donate it to the "Free School Fund" to express my sympathy."</p>

<h3 id="e36">Record of the Japanese Air Force Unit's Operations Against Enemy Submarines <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Attacking submarines is not an easy task. Our base is always defending the ocean day and night to prepare for the activities of the American task force. Whenever transport convoys go out to perform replenishment tasks and return, the air force units of our base are breathless with work. In addition, whenever enemy submarines are discovered, pursuing and killing the murderous enemy submarines is truly a modern scientific undertaking. After receiving the telegram discovering the enemy submarine, we immediately dispatch enemy planes to all directions. However, finding it is not an easy task. Because sometimes the enemy submarine implements submerged navigation, and sometimes the weather is bad and it is impossible to search for the enemy.</p>
<p>However, once the enemy submarine is discovered, victory always belongs to us. We carry out lightning-fast bombing and summon our own fighter planes, and hand over the work of destroying the enemy submarine to the maritime defense ships and submarine chasers. Discovering the enemy submarine and determining its location is truly a difficult battle. This mainly relies on radio wave detectors and other machines. The squadron leader of the air force unit often says:</p>
<p>"Our battle must not be blind. If the radio wave detector malfunctions, it is worse than an engine failure. If the radio wave detector malfunctions, we have no choice but to return to base."</p>
<p>Submarine Cemetery</p>
<p>In the coastal waters near our Japanese homeland, there are several places called submarine cemetery seas. The route most frequently traveled by Japanese transport ships is also where enemy submarines most often appear.</p>
<p>At one location, six submarines have been sunk since the second half of 1943, at the second location four submarines have been sunk, and at the third location three submarines have been sunk. At other locations, the number of sunken submarines is also not small. The number of sunken submarines is not only based on eyewitness accounts during the attack, but also on investigations at the sinking location and careful judgment of the enemy's ship type before being announced.</p>
<p>Regarding the special mission of our unit, night flying is especially important. On the dark ocean at night, we use radio wave detectors to detect enemy submarines floating silently.</p>
<p>Attacking Enemy Submarines</p>
<p>Second Lieutenant Arai is an air force reserve student who graduated from Hiroshima Higher Normal School. On the morning of January 24, black clouds covered the sky, and on the sea surface with white waves surging, he discovered a floating enemy submarine. It was a large submarine with a periscope that can be used day and night, and three radio wave detector antennas erected. The enemy was negligent because of the rain, but after realizing that it had been discovered, the stern of the submarine stood up like a rod and immediately began a rapid dive, disappearing from the sea surface in less than twenty or thirty seconds. We then bombed the sinking area and monitored it for an hour, but unfortunately, due to a leak in the fuel tank, we had to reluctantly return to base.</p>
<p>Chief Flight Petty Officer Omukai used to protect convoys at a base in the South Sea. As soon as he left port, he discovered three enemy submarines attacking. He immediately began to attack the enemy submarine that had dived to a depth of fifteen meters. At that time, he used radio to summon Japanese planes that were about to return to base from all directions, and always attacked with bombs whenever the enemy submarine entered or exited the water. At the same time, Japanese submarines also participated in the battle, and finally a large amount of oil floated on the sea surface, which confirmed that two enemy submarines had been sunk.</p>
<p>Chief Flight Petty Officer Murakami once discovered the oil slick of an enemy submarine. The so-called oil slick is the seepage of lubricating oil, etc. In the direction of the submarine's movement, there is an oil slick with a diameter of two or three meters, intermittently floating for ten meters. However, it is very difficult to discover when the waves are large. After discovering this kind of oil slick, the Chief Flight Petty Officer immediately bombed it. Under the sunlight, the shimmering oil slick stopped, but gradually expanded again.</p>
<p>Escorting Convoys</p>
<p>Escorting convoys is a daily task of our base units. In addition to the direct escort by maritime defense ships and anti-submarine ships, there are also planes from base to base, taking on aerial escort like a relay race. On a vast expanse of ocean, it is difficult to find a convoy without being pointed out, but the pilots hover in the sky searching for the convoy that is as small as a bean. On the transport ships, tiny humans wave their hats and wave their clothes to express their gratitude. On the sea where enemy submarines come and go unpredictably, encountering the buzzing Japanese planes often brings tears to the eyes of the sailors.

<p>From Tokyo to the waters of the Ogasawara Islands, many linear archipelagos are densely distributed, such as the Izu Islands, Torishima, etc., no less than a dozen islands, and the Tanegashima Island, Yakushima Island, Ryukyu Islands, Okinawa Island, Miyako Island and other islands from Kyushu to Taiwan. The Japanese army has established defenses everywhere, taking every step carefully, and the co-defense is as solid as a copper wall and iron fortress. On the 18th and 19th of this month, the enemy American fleet created disturbances in the southeastern sea of Japan. After the courageous attack by the Japanese air force, the enemy suffered many losses. The surviving ships have retreated to the south, and the Japanese army is currently pursuing them.</p>
<h3 id="e38">A Journey to Dongshan <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Yishan</p>
<p>On a chilly spring morning, I set out with a pleasant feeling to the station, intending to take a slow train to Suzhou and then transfer to Dongshan. The station was packed with people, all crowding at the ticket windows, so tightly packed that they could barely breathe. The black-capped staff wielded their rattan whips like raindrops, striking anger into the hearts of every traveler, who glared with hatred at the face beneath the black cap, a face revealing fangs and wearing a cannibalistic grin. It was a scene of unimaginable sorrow. I waited like this for a full two hours. The railway bureau then posted a temporary notice stating that the slow train was suspended for the day. The excited hopes of the crowd plunged into the abyss of disappointment, and they dispersed, each carrying a sense of frustration. I learned that the railway bureau's slow trains had been running irregularly these past few days, with no certainty. As I was eager to get to Dongshan and also wanted to see the situation along the highway to Suzhou, I decided to take a bus instead. At the northern end of the New Rubbish Bridge, there were small car companies specializing in passenger transport. Upon making inquiries, I found that all the cars were fully booked for the day. Only a cargo truck could take a few passengers in addition to its cargo. So, for the price of 23,000 yuan, I sat on a truck loaded with cigarettes at 9:30 AM, embarking on my journey to Suzhou like a piece of merchandise.</p>
<p>On the Shanghai-Suzhou Road</p>
<p>The highway to Suzhou had suffered damage along the way due to the war. In particular, there were nearly a hundred wooden bridges leading to Suzhou. Because no one was responsible for repairing them, they were in very poor condition. Some were simply impassable, and even those that could be traversed were extremely dangerous. Most buses to Suzhou took the Jiaotong Road – Yangjia Bridge route, then turned onto Zhennan Road, and directly reached Suzhou via the Kuntai Road. Not far from Suzhou, at Waikuatang, a section of the highway had been impassable a few days earlier, so buses had to take the Xihu Road to Changshu and then to Suzhou. On the day I went, that section of the highway was passable, but when we reached that place, the truck's rear wheels got stuck in the mud. Passengers all had to get out and temporarily act as laborers, unloading the cargo one piece at a time. We practically pushed the truck for a distance before we could reach Suzhou. This delay cost us three hours. I departed at 9:30 AM and didn't arrive in Suzhou until 11:00 PM. It took a full thirteen and a half hours, passing through Zhenru, Nanxiang, Jiading, Waigang, Taicang, Kunshan, Zhengyi, Weiting, and Suzhou. Along the way, there were checkpoints for passengers and goods from various organizations, including the Ministry of Finance's Inspection Office on Zhongshan Road, the Jianghai Customs Zhongshan Road Branch and Surveillance Post, the Ministry of Finance's Inspection Office in Waigang, the Jiading County Hujiaqiao Grand Inspection Station, the Taicang Grand Inspection Station, the Kunshan Grand Inspection Station, the Suzhou Grand Inspection Station, and many other smaller inspection offices. It was literally a checkpoint every three steps and a barrier every five. Cars had to stop at every checkpoint, and the length of the delay depended on the negotiation skills of the person handling it. Along the way, rice prices gradually decreased from Shanghai to Suzhou: 100,000 yuan in Shanghai, 90,000 in Zhenru, 70,000 in Taicang, 60,000 in Kunshan, and 50,000 in Suzhou. There were many "danbang" individuals (carrying poles with goods on each end) traveling between Nanxiang and Shanghai, mostly transporting rice to Shanghai, each carrying about five dou (a Chinese unit of dry volume). Some rode bicycles and could carry a full dan (two loads, one on each end of a carrying pole). According to these "danbang" individuals, they were doing it merely to make a living. The security along the way was good.</p>
<p>The Current Situation in Suzhou</p>
<p>"Above is paradise, below are Suzhou and Hangzhou." This is a saying that everyone knows. Although Suzhou after the incident is not as much of a paradise as it used to be, the fact that rice prices in Suzhou were only between 40,000 and 50,000 yuan per dan when rice in Shanghai was selling for 100,000 yuan per dan cannot but be said to be still maintaining the bliss of paradise. The recent situation in Suzhou seems very lively. Just look at the several cafes that have hired female singers from Shanghai to sing a couple of popular songs in front of a "microphone." A cup of plain tea costs nearly a thousand yuan, yet the seats are still packed. Ordinary teahouses like Wuyuan and Hongxing are also full every evening. Elderly people and young children alike are leisurely passing the time with teapots in hand. People and horses throng Guanjian Street, and the noisy, bustling scene is no less lively than Nanjing Road in Shanghai. Hotel business is booming, and even the most ordinary rooms cost over a thousand yuan per night. Renting a house has become quite difficult recently. Good houses are impossible to find, and even if there are any, they require a "key money" just like in Shanghai. Rent is mostly calculated based on rice prices, usually around one or two dan per month. Recently, due to power restrictions, there has sometimes been no electricity at night, which has somewhat affected the night market. "Horse carriages to Tiger Hill!" are still being called out on the streets. Although there are fewer tourists than before, the carriage drivers can still make a minimal living. In Xuanmiao Temple, there are still many people playing with yellow birds, releasing them with one hand and feeding them with the other, their contented expressions making you forget that this is a world ravaged by war. The leisure and contentment of the people of Suzhou truly make the saying "Above is paradise, below are Suzhou and Hangzhou" ring true.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Dongshan</p>
<p>Dongshan is an island in Taihu Lake, under the jurisdiction of Wu County. The entire mountain is about 60 kilometers in circumference, with a pleasant climate and fertile soil. The trip from Suzhou to Dongshan involves taking a boat outside Xumen. The boat is towed by a charcoal-powered motor launch, which is not very fast but travels smoothly. The boat company previously only had one company called Baoxing Steamship Bureau, with one round trip between Dongshan and Suzhou each day. The ticket price is 1,200 yuan per person, with 1,500 yuan for meals and tips. Each boat can seat about 300 people. The boat departs at 9:00 AM. Sitting on the boat moving with the waves, the scenery on both sides is beautiful, passing through Hengtang, Xishang, Muli, Hengjing, Pujing, Shitang, and Ducun before reaching Dongshan. At Shihu behind Hengtang, and Baiyang Bay past Muli Bridge, there are two mouths of Taihu Lake. They are vast and boundless, with blue waves stretching as far as the eye can see, but banditry is rampant, endangering travelers. So, it is a little dangerous for boats passing through here. In the past, there had been incidents involving boats here. Recently, when boats pass through, several armed comrades patrol the shore with guns for protection, so there have been no accidents. In Hengjing, there is the Hengjing Inspection Station, but the inspection procedures are not very troublesome. The boat arrives at the front of Dongshan around 5:00 PM. The entire mountain of Dongshan is divided into front and back parts, with Mogan Peak as the boundary. The south is the front mountain, and the north is the back mountain. The total population of the mountain was originally 26,000, but has recently increased to over 30,000. The highest administrative institution is the former 12th District Office, and the current district head is Mr. Zhao Shimin. There are also police stations and security teams. The security situation has been quite good recently. Most of the empty houses on the mountain have been demolished, or only a small part of them remains. There is a lot of vacant land, especially arable land. The busiest streets are East Street and West Street, which can be said to be the commercial center of the entire mountain. The largest business is the rice industry, with several companies such as Tongtaisheng. Next is foreign goods, with several companies such as Jishunxing. Small industries are still lacking. There is no electricity, and telegrams cannot be sent directly. There is one post office, which forwards letters. Rice and grain are entirely dependent on imports from nearby Hengjing, Wujiang, Pingwang, Huzhou, and other places. The quantity is not very sufficient. The current rice price is about 40,000 yuan per dan, meat is over 800 yuan per catty (a Chinese unit of weight, about 500g) by market weight, vegetables are 150 yuan per catty by old weight, and fish is over 600 yuan per catty. Most of the residents on the mountain mainly raise fish and grow fruits. They used to have some good days in the past, but the current situation is not as good as before, so life is very hard. The annual production of the entire mountain includes March tea leaves, with a yield of about 5 dan, May loquats with about 3,000 dan, June waxberries with about 6,000 dan, July ginkgo and chestnuts with about 1,500 dan, and fish and shrimp with about 2,000 dan throughout the year. There is also a famous type of mutton that is very delicious. The production of bamboo and wood is quite abundant, making it very suitable for building houses. There are schools such as Wenchang, Wuben, Zhongxiu, Moli, Xiwu, and Liaoguo on the mountain, but only a small number of mountain residents receive education. The front mountain is more lively than the back mountain, which is a bit more remote. The mountain residents are diligent, thrifty, hardworking, and very kind to outsiders. If some small industries and scientifically managed farms could be established here, it would be a very promising undertaking. After staying on the mountain for several days, the reporter, after observing the situation, very much agrees with Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's proposal to make Dongting Mountain a destination for evacuation.</p>
<p>Evacuation Issues</p>
<p>Just as Mr. Xiang said, it must not be taken as an expedient measure for wartime refuge, but should be approached with a long-term plan. Even after peace is restored, it should continue to be developed and expanded. Instead of taking Dongshan as a temporary place of refuge, it would be more appropriate to take it as a permanent enterprise. Dongshan has abundant production and a good environment. Especially in this time of war, Dongshan, isolated in Taihu Lake, can be considered a secluded paradise. If managed properly, it can easily become a scenic residential area. But before any immigration, there must be a detailed plan to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 30,000 residents in Dongshan. If, as Mr. Xiang proposed, 100,000 people go there in the first wave, then an average of twenty people would live in one flat, requiring 5,000 flats. The number of empty houses in Dongshan now is very small, so simple flats must be built in advance to accommodate 100,000 people. There is definitely no problem with the vacant land on the mountain for building 5,000 flats. A permanent power supply should be established throughout the mountain, and creating more small industries can solve the daily needs of the immigrants. Cooperating with local residents to run large-scale farms and aquaculture companies can increase the mountain's production. These can all be done as investment methods, which are easier to implement (in fact, this type of investment is reasonable and effective). Currently, most of the residents of Dongshan are engaged in planting and selling. Industry is very scarce, but in terms of the environment, it is definitely not absolutely impossible. Among the 100,000 people, there must be five public hospitals and twenty schools of varying levels. The organization of the post office must be expanded. These must be built with the assistance of the authorities. As for the expansion of administrative institutions and the assurance of security, that, of course, must also be assisted by the authorities for it to be successful. The organization of a civil affairs consultative council is indispensable. Under such a massive new construction, the consultative council has the power to coordinate and promote. A cooperative is an organization that needs to be established. Utilize the differences in the qualities of immigrants to achieve a state of mutual cooperation and mutual development. Currently, the lives of the mountain residents are quite difficult. A method must be devised in advance to coordinate the economies of the mountain residents and the immigrants to avoid friction (historically, large-scale immigration has caused all sorts of misfortune with the existing residents, and this is definitely not something that can be solved with pressure). The food supply on the mountain is not very sufficient, so sufficient supplies must be secured in advance. Fortunately, neighboring counties produce abundant rice. Exchanging materials to obtain sufficient food is not difficult, but the detail and rigor of the planners and executors must not be ignored. As for transporting immigrants and their belongings, a dedicated ship must be determined. Each time, at least 3,000 people should be in a large group, and each ship should have 300 people as a team. A team leader should be assigned to manage the necessary matters during the journey. The ship should sail directly from Shanghai to Dongshan, be equipped with self-defense weapons, and contact the inspection agencies along the way in advance to avoid unnecessary delays and troubles. The travel expenses should be allocated by statistically dividing the along the way expenses, which would be fairer.</p>
<p>In short, because the residents of Dongshan have not improved their production technology, they will become increasingly degenerate. If they borrow the power of immigrants, increase capital, and improve technology, then the production of the entire mountain will definitely increase. Therefore, the main purpose of immigrating to Dongshan is definitely not passive refuge, but active construction!</p>
<h3 id="e39">Group Walking Evacuation <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ende</p>
<p>At a time when rice is as precious as pearls, firewood as expensive as cinnamon, and all goods are rising in price, coupled with the threat of air raids, evacuation from Shanghai is truly necessary. However, although there are many who are preparing to evacuate and return to their hometowns, many are hesitant due to inconvenient transportation and lack of vehicles and ships.</p>
<p>In view of the lack of transportation and the large number of people who urgently need to evacuate, it would be better to stipulate that women, children, and the elderly have priority in using vehicles and ships, while the general young and strong should automatically return to their hometowns in groups on foot. In the past, during the evacuation from Hong Kong, many people walked in groups, taking detours to reach Shanghai. Therefore, this action is not entirely impossible. But it is inconvenient to walk alone, and there is a lack of care along the way, so it must be done in groups. Here is a brief description of the method:</p>
<p>(1) The Evacuation Committee and various hometown associations should jointly register those who volunteer to evacuate on foot.</p>
<p>(2) Form teams of 50 to 100 people, divided by hometown and county. Each team should have a captain, filled by a capable person. The organization can refer to the travel team method of ordinary school groups.</p>
<p>(3) The Evacuation Committee or the hometown association should send personnel to lead and be responsible for negotiation and protection.</p>
<p>(4) The Evacuation Committee or the hometown association should contact public places, schools, temples, ancestral halls, etc., in advance in important towns along the way to serve as places for rest and lodging. If necessary, temporary reception centers may be set up to receive them.</p>
<p>(5) Those returning to their hometowns should give a certain amount of money to the Evacuation Committee or the hometown association for expenses, the amount to be determined as needed, with thrift as the principle.</p>
<p>(6) Prepare meals along the way in advance, or bring dry food, which each person will take care of themselves.</p>
<p>(7) Bring as few items as possible, but multiple people can jointly hire porters to carry the load, so that they can walk empty-handed, which is more convenient.</p>
<p>(8) Taking the journey back to Ningbo on foot as an example: To go from Shanghai to Ningbo, you can go through Hangzhou, cross the Qiantang River, and go through Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Yuyao to Ningbo. But you can also go from Minhang to Zhapu or Ganpu, cross Hangzhou Bay to Yuyao, Andong, or the upper reaches of the boundary, but the latter is more convenient. However, when crossing Hangzhou Bay, there are places where robbers prey, so military protection is necessary. Along the way, if Minhang is the first stop, Jinshan or Zhapu is the second stop, and Yuyao across the river is the third stop, the lodging places can be determined based on the distance, and Ningbo can be reached in about four or five days.</p>

<h3 id="e40">The Flute Player <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Ou</p>
<p>My small room faces a noisy street, where there is clamor all day long; children sing, housewives scold on the street, peddlers solicit customers with hoarse voices, and beggars desperately plead… the sounds of the city interweave into a symphony of life. Whether sad or happy, the days always flow by faintly, and naturally a part of me is swept away in it.</p>
<p>In the morning, the apprentices remove the door panels, and the bustling market pours out. In the evening, they put up the door panels, and the sounds of the market are shut inside. At this time, on the dimly lit streets at dusk, an old man selling flutes and huqins plays music.</p>
<p>The loud flute sound resonates in the twilight. Have you ever been alone in your small room and unintentionally heard a girl humming Peking opera tunes along with the music? The lingering echoes make you uneasy in your loneliness, and even worse, they seduce your fantasies. Soon, I declared: I want to be a wandering flute player, I want to play the flute alone in the small streets and alleys. I want to seduce young boys and girls, to make them uneasy in their loneliness, just like that old man, luring children to wander the streets after me.</p>
<p>My grandmother laughed at me for being unambitious. She told me: Many young people love the flute, that clear sound. They play it all year round, and they become thin and weak, withered… If you doubt it, you should split open the flute in their hands, and inside there will be only blood—the heart's blood of young people.</p>
<p>But my grandmother could not suppress my passionate exuberance. Finally, on a street at dusk, I caught up with the old man playing the flute, and I bought a flute from him. I said:</p>
<p>"Give me the best one!"</p>
<p>"Every flute is the same," he replied indifferently. He picked one at random and gave it to me.</p>
<p>After that, the flute consumed my time. I pursed my lips and blew, and I puckered my lips and blew. I inhaled deeply and blew hard, and I let the air out slowly. But the flute remained silent. I began to get angry—surely the old man had deceived me.</p>
<p>So, I chased after him again on the street at dusk. I said agitatedly:</p>
<p>"You're lying. Only your flute can play!"</p>
<p>He didn't answer, but slowly put my flute to his lips; every flute played loudly, and my flute could indeed move people like his.</p>
<p>I felt humiliated. I took back my flute, returned to my small room, and in the twilight, I pursed my lips and blew, and I puckered my lips and blew; I inhaled deeply and blew hard, and I let the air out slowly—I didn't bother the old man again.</p>
<p>By the time I had learned the flute, and people began to feel uneasy because of my flute music, the old man selling flutes and huqins no longer appeared on the streets at dusk.</p>
<p>I played in the twilight, sending the loud flute sound throbbing into the eardrums of young boys and girls… People began to get thin, and people withered! My grandmother's words were indeed true. Finally, I got sick, and in the twilight, I could only hear someone else's flute music resonating.</p>
<p>I caressed my flute, wondering if it could absorb the heart's blood of the flute player?</p>
<h3 id="e41">Pear Blossom and Crabapple <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Shufang</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Yue, facing the sun, was knitting a woolen thread in front of the window. The school clerk pushed the door open and handed her an invitation card. She took it and saw that the signature on it was: Xin Wancheng.</p>
<p>She quickly recalled a memory. Last week, at the principal's fiftieth birthday, she was introduced to a wealthy businessman, that old man who paid close attention to her. He wasn't too old, but he was approaching fifty.</p>
<p>She couldn't help but feel a little strange. They had only met once, and he was already sending her an invitation. She smiled to herself, thinking, why not! It's a good opportunity. Perhaps this could be the realization of her long-held dream—to establish an orphanage. She happily put the invitation in the drawer.</p>
<p>The next day, she went to the address to attend the banquet. She pressed the doorbell, and a servant respectfully led her to the reception room. Strangely, it was very quiet and there wasn't a single person there. The reception room contained a set of solemn and heavy mahogany furniture, a chestnut-colored carpet, chestnut-colored sofas, and chestnut-colored window curtains. The room lacked sunlight, and the corners were filled with shadows. Yueheng involuntarily shivered. Words like "gloomy" and "somber" rose in her mind like soap bubbles.</p>
<p>She returned to school after having dinner, her expression a bit excited. Bi and Hui, who lived with her, asked her where she had gone, returning so late. Yueheng smiled and held out a hand, a dazzling diamond ring on her finger. Bi and Hui were startled and more urgently asked her what was going on.</p>
<p>"I'm getting engaged soon, to that overseas Chinese businessman Xin Wancheng. In two weeks, I'll treat you to the engagement banquet," Yueheng said calmly and easily.</p>
<p>Bi and Hui had also met Xin Wancheng at the principal's birthday. Although his appearance wasn't necessarily repulsive, he seemed a bit eccentric. And it was said that he was very stingy. Despite being so wealthy, he had never donated a single cent. The principal seemed to have mentioned that he became like this after his wife died. Based on this, Bi strongly advised Yueheng not to be too careless about her life's important matter. The age difference between them was so great that there wouldn't be happiness. Moreover, such an engagement was too sudden and too fast. But Yueheng said that Xin Wancheng had promised to provide the money for her to set up an orphanage. Her long-held wish had been fulfilled, and even if it meant sacrificing her lifelong happiness, it was insignificant.</p>
<p>After getting engaged, Yueheng didn't let up for a moment, urging Wancheng to prepare for the orphanage. Wancheng rushed about, finding a building and buying supplies for her. He hired many people to help prepare for various matters. Finally, three months later, the orphanage officially opened. Yueheng was appointed as the director, with Bi and Hui as her right-hand assistants, managing important affairs. Initially, there weren't many orphans, but later the number gradually increased, showing a thriving spirit. At this time, Wancheng proposed marriage. Yueheng, in line with her consistent style since the engagement, agreed without hesitation.</p>
<p>Having just finished the orphanage matters, she was now busy with the wedding. Yueheng felt that she had lost a lot of weight, but a naturally beautiful person is always beautiful, whether she's thin or fat. If she's fatter, people say she's "plump" or "full." If she's thinner, descriptions like "piteous," "unable to bear silk garments," and other such adjectives are even more pleasing to the ear. Now that Yueheng was thinner, Wancheng said she was more charming and lovable than before.</p>
<p>The night before the wedding, Yueheng felt a bit melancholy. Tomorrow, she would marry a man twice her age. In many ways, she and Wancheng were mismatched and incompatible. She herself wasn't unaware of this, but she was too enthusiastic about her career. It seemed that only today did she have time to think about it. Bi had said that her marriage to Wancheng was just like the line in the poem, "A pear blossom branch pressing down on a crabapple." She thought that everyone would definitely have this feeling tomorrow. She sadly shed tears.</p>
<p>The next day, Yueheng dressed up like a fairy. She heard nothing but words of praise. Wancheng was also beaming with joy, blushing and paling as he was teased by his friends. Yueheng pretended to be very happy. She wondered if she was the center of a comedy now, or the protagonist of a tragedy in the future.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Because Yueheng disliked the gloomy and lifeless appearance of that house, Wancheng bought a new set of teak furniture, replaced it with colorful carpets, and green curtains. The new house was even more colorful, dazzling to the eye. Yueheng loved flowers by nature. Now, in this residence, there was a vase of flowers here and a vase of flowers there, which indeed made it more lively.</p>
<p>In the past, Wancheng was the emperor in this palace. Now, Yueheng was the empress. Her authority was even above the emperor's, and even the emperor had to accommodate her. Two weeks passed quickly. Yueheng was so leisurely that she was starting to get bored. She decided to go to the orphanage every day to handle affairs.</p>
<p>Most of her married life was peaceful and hazy. She put everything out of her mind and focused her energy on the orphanage. She watched the children read, play, and rest, and she felt unparalleled joy.</p>
<p>In recent days, they had hardly talked about personal matters. It was like pointless small talk, saying one thing here and another thing there, making it embarrassingly boring. Yueheng was deliberately indifferent, while Wancheng was still the same as before they got married. Yueheng didn't care at all. He was just chewing on the taste of loneliness.</p>
<p>Yueheng had a bad habit, which was "knowing full well yet still doing it." She had done many things like this. She always wanted to change, but she could never change. Just like now, she knew very well that Wancheng loved her very much, and as long as she showed one point of love, she could get ten times the reward. But she just wouldn't do it, and she couldn't even say why. Until it was her birthday, Wancheng happened to be feeling a bit unwell, but he still cheered himself up to invite guests for her. He got up early in the morning and spent half an hour shaving his beard himself. He didn't forget his shortcomings and tried his best to hide them in order to win Yueheng's favor. Yueheng was very touched. That morning, she also went to the barber shop and combed her curly long hair into a bun. Thus, the gray soul between them was lifted by the power of the beard and hair, revealing a vast moonlight.</p>
<p>After the guests dispersed, they were the only two left in the house. Yueheng realized her mistake and didn't want to make it again. She could love the orphans of the world, so how could she not love her husband? She thought that she shouldn't leave Wancheng, who was more than twenty years older than her, to be alone again. She decided to love him well in the future.</p>
<p>During that minor illness, Yueheng took care of him very meticulously. After he recovered, she personally took care of his diet and daily life, unknowingly changing Wancheng's bossy temper towards the servants. Needless to say, Wancheng was extremely grateful! People say that marriage is the tomb of love, but they only began to fall in love half a year after their marriage.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>It was New Year's Eve. The house was decorated with a completely new look. It was snowing, and the weather was really cold. After dinner, Yueheng and Wancheng sat around the brazier, warming themselves. They were planning for next year. Next year would bring them a little baby. The thought that they would soon be a father and a mother brought smiles to their faces. Yueheng planned that the orphanage would add a handicraft class next year so that the orphans would have the opportunity to practice their skills. Wancheng planned to work hard on his career next year because he would have a child. The child was still very young!</p>
<p>Despite the howling north wind and heavy snow outside, they were living a spring life in winter. Originally, Wancheng was selfish, tyrannical, and stingy because he was lonely and no one cared about him. He had no joy in life, so he was jealous of other people's happiness. He lost his temper with his subordinates and cursed them harshly. He didn't get other people's sympathy, and he didn't pity other people. He wouldn't take out a single penny to do good deeds. Yueheng, needless to say, was selfish, insincere in everything she did, and her bad habit of "knowing full well yet still doing it" was very obvious. But now they had both become good. Wancheng was moved by Yueheng's enthusiasm for the orphanage and gave up his stinginess. Yueheng, because of Wancheng's love, dedicated her sincerity to the marriage. In the nurturing of love, they corrected their shortcomings.</p>
<p>"True affection" and "sincere love" are two hot springs. They can wash away your trauma, encourage you to improve, and even more so, clarify your bad dregs. Now, this old husband and young wife, Wancheng and Yueheng, may seem mismatched and incompatible on the surface, but who can say that they are not happy?</p>
<h3 id="e42">Traces and Other Things <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shu</p>
<p>Traces</p>
<p>They were all young companions. After several years of wandering, they had the opportunity to reunite and tell each other about their feelings of separation. It was really rare. As I held his warm hand, I noticed the yellowish-brown, scorched traces on his fingertips. There was no other reason for this than that he smoked a lot of cigarettes. Surprised by his change, I naively asked him:</p>
<p>"How did you get addicted to this habit?"</p>
<p>But he didn't answer immediately. Instead, he grabbed my hand and found traces on my fingers that were the same as his, the obvious marks from long-term burns caused by cigarette butts, revealing everything.</p>
<p>Two lines of melancholy and ashamed gazes intertwined, forming a reminder of the vicissitudes of the world. A faint smile appeared, and we remained silent. Both of us were probably sighing: This turbulent and ever-changing era is a training ground for young people.</p>
<p>White Hair</p>
<p>This time, it was my new discovery. At the edges of my friend's unkempt hair, numerous strands of white hair had been added. The lively and clever "little sparrow" of the past had actually become like this, turning into an "old man with white hair"?</p>
<p>White hair should be a symbol of aging, but he was clearly still a student studying. According to general imagination, this should be the golden prime of a young man's life, full of youthful vigor, a time to be envied and envied.</p>
<p>Now, my friend was actually facing the mirror, stroking those patches of white hair on that withered face with black-rimmed glasses, and just murmuring softly: "It's not a big deal. Who in the world can avoid setbacks? Who can resist fatigue and decay? If someone says that other people's youth is spring, then spring has gone far away from me, leaving only the desolate mood of late autumn."</p>
<p>"Why are you saying such decadent things? You're still young, your spirit is still gestating, and the bright and magnificent era is still beckoning to you. Why be self-deprecating? You should jump out of this depressing personal circle. There's always sunshine outside that can restore your youth."</p>
<p>A resolute voice was telling him, and also telling me the same thing. I didn't know if this voice was mine or his.</p>
<p>In short, he nodded and extended a warm hand. In exchange for my encouragement to him, there was still a burning power.</p>
<p>Spring</p>
<p>We were still wandering on the street, experiencing the season of spring that had not been long in coming.</p>
<p>We strolled slowly, and the rare and warm sunshine dragged out our shadows. The spring breeze brought a gentle charm, soothing our breathing. Looking up at the clear blue sky, without saying a word, it also strengthened our new hope.</p>
<p>At the intersection, we temporarily said goodbye. Once again, we firmly grasped our reluctant hands. I pointed to the new buds sprouting on the branches, the street trees spitting out green, and still sincerely blessed:</p>
<p>"In the spring breeze, I'll give you a heart of spring, driving away the autumn desolation of the past. This is exactly the right time!"</p>

<h3 id="e43">International Cup Football Tournament Contribution of the Chinese Team Authorities <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>In this International Cup Football Tournament, the number of units registered to participate is seven. They are China, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Jewish, Nordic, and Russia. The matches that have already been played are Nordic winning against Russia, one to zero. Italy winning against Japan three to one, and yesterday Portugal won against Jewish with two to one. Here is a brief list of the situation:</p>
<p>Recent situation</p>
<p>Commentary on yesterday's battle: Portugal wins against Jewish</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:30 PM, there was a scene, Portugal against Jewish. The former is proud in the league. However, in this International Cup, because Fuen Pantoson and others all belong to the Nordic countries, and Bauxu脱·柯莱脱 and others are also unable to participate due to nationality relations. Therefore, the strength is far from comparable to the Portuguese merchants in the league. The Jewish team is a mediocre team. There was originally no hope of winning the championship. However, the spirit of the team is very good, putting victory or defeat behind them, which is also worth mentioning. The lineup of the two teams is as follows:</p>
<p>Although Portugal is weaker, it was expected that they would win against Jewish. Therefore, after the start of the game, it seemed that they were not very energetic. Unexpectedly, the Jewish team was enterprising and aggressive. Although there were not many offensive, the defense was just right. The Portuguese team had to cheer up. There was a change of atmosphere. Ge Quli was young and promising. Taking advantage of the opportunity of M Gelinbao's chaotic road, he went straight in and fulfilled his mission, winning the first city. After the fall of the Jewish team, there was no discouragement, and they made a concerted effort. S Gelinbao raised troops on the right, and immediately returned the color, making it a tie. Afterwards, the situation was entirely in a tug-of-war situation. The Jewish team did their best, and the Portuguese team could not help it. Until 40 minutes, Luo Chailiao got the supply of 奥列维拉, and went straight in, and swept his foot at fifteen places near the door, which was very skillful. The device of 勃孟 was helpless. The Portuguese team exceeded again with two to one, and it was also the only goal of this reality, laying the victory. The first half ended with two to one. In the second half, the Portuguese team had a steady victory in mind, and made progress. V苏君's repeated cold arrows, unpredictable, the Jewish team had an unyielding spirit and strict defense. Gai 勃孟 saved a dangerous ball, and his credit cannot be erased. Therefore, until the end of the game, they still gained nothing. Portugal finally won Jewish with two to one, and will compete with the Nordic team for the final qualification. And the other group of China and Italy also meet in the battle for the final. In the future, all countries will win with surprise and seize the International Cup with international honor, which will present a warm situation and exert the best ball skills to feast the eyes of our fans.</p>
<p>Predicting that the future situation will be a dispute between China and Italy</p>
<p>Looking at the strength of the teams, China and Italy are the most promising. The Portuguese team's lineup is not strong enough. The Nordic team is mainly composed of German merchants, and with the help of Fuen w Pantoson, the lineup is still good. But it feels that their contact is still difficult to be satisfactory. When they meet the Portuguese team, they can be said to be evenly matched, but when they play against China or Italy in the final, it seems that it will be difficult to avoid. According to this, the semi-final between China and Italy can also be said to be the final, and both teams must have made some plans before competing.</p>
<p>Hope that the Chinese authorities should prepare for the future</p>
<p>Looking back on the past, whenever the Chinese team participates in the International Cup, it must be established as early as possible and practiced. However, recently the author always feels that it is only a "star system" to select the army with the most famous, but there is no need to wait for the study before the event, and even during the competition, it is mixed into a straight up, winning or losing is another matter. To ask for a satisfactory record, I have not seen it. Therefore, I have to hope that the Chinese team should prepare for the future and add more training. I hope that I can succeed in defeating the enemy at a few hours, and be a Chinese team. Moreover, this time, 幼良韩龙海李祥 are all in the list of no qualification to attend China, and the donation loss is very large. I dare to this time, and then select the lineup, which is also what should be taken to deal with Italy.</p>
<p>Two goalkeepers should be taken, and each can play half the game. If the situation in the first half is still good, then it is not necessary to adjust. The recent situation of Zhuang Youren is very good, and he can be competent, and Chen Xiaojun also has the most normal training, and he will surely live up to people's expectations. The center guard line Zhu Lingsheng and Li Tiansheng live on the left, and can be expected to have a tacit understanding. Meng Yiliang and Zhang Lingen all have a fluttering situation. Since the left and right of the forward are lacking, they have to 重许文奎费春华, 刘麟, and in the middle 麟策, and the left and right two forwards, Li Yiju and Sun Jin are rich in pulling the door, reflecting each other and shining brightly. The harvest must be considerable. See this, I hope that the authorities will adopt and improve it, and do not let the International Cup related to international honor be taken away by the 胡儿, then the football world is fortunate.

<h3 id="e44">Shantou Team Celebrates 3rd Anniversary Wonderful Basketball Friendship Match <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>In order to celebrate the 3rd anniversary of the establishment of the Shantou Team Basketball, the Shantou Fellow Association specially invited the two teams of the Central North and the Fat Team to play friendly matches with the A and B groups of the Shantou Team at the Youth Association on Baxian Bridge yesterday from 7:00 PM, and the program can be called wonderful. Also, because the good show of basketball has been suspended for a long time, the decisive battle between Hualian Central North has not had a definite date, and fans have taken this good opportunity to go to appreciate it. However, in this performance match, the Shantou team is purely to entertain fellow villagers, in order to arouse the attention of fellow villagers to amateur sports, the meaning is very profound, but for countless enthusiastic fans, I feel regret. Yesterday, the four weeks of the court were full of people, and Lin Zuo poem's hard work was rewarded, no wonder he was full of spring breeze, triumphant and triumphant. The introduction of sports, such as achievements, is worth admiring, and the two battle strategies are on the left:</p>
<p>Fat Team wins Shantou Team B 35——23</p>
<p>Central North and Shantou Team A 27——27</p>
<p>The reason for the failure of Shantou B is that it is too cautious</p>
<p>The defeat of Shantou B is entirely due to being too cautious. When they get the ball, they do not dare to use high-speed offense, which is too eager to win. And the guards still use five-man zone defense, which is relatively outdated. The Fat Team has made great progress in ball skills recently, and the center Wang Rongsheng is worthy of being a latecomer, advancing by leaps and bounds, and is a promising talent. The only shortcoming is that the turning is still too slow. The little fat man Yan You is lively and active, and the performance is quite well received. The victory of the Fat Team is by no means a fluke. The result in the first half was 21 to 13, and the overall result was 35 to 23, with the Fat Team leading.</p>
<p>Central North and Shantou Team A fulfill the purpose of carnival</p>
<p>The battle between Central North and Shantou Team A gave the audience a boost. Because Shen Gong's foot injury has not healed, Central North added the famous player Yin Huanwen, who came from the north, to help out, and it is still neat. At the beginning of the game, both sides used man-to-man. Shantou team relied on the spirit of the foot, and achieved nine points in one breath. Central North got nothing. Seeing that the players were a little bit powerless, Central North suddenly changed to a five-man zone defense to wait for work. I don't know how, Shantou team also changed to a five-man zone defense, which made Li Zhenzhong frequently shoot wonderful shots. In the first half, Central North finally reversed the defeat and won with 17 to 12. In the second half, Shantou team tried its best to counterattack, and observed the biggest mistake in the first half, which was to try Du Weicong as a defender, and the forward got less points. In the second half, Lin Yi changed to the front line, which made Central North's threat very strong and caught up. In the last two or three minutes, the Shantou team exceeded with 27 to 25. Fortunately, Central North relied on Chen Xuesong's last shot to make each 27 draw and shake hands to make peace.</p>
<p>In summary, this competition is because of the nature of friendship, so both sides can play as much as possible in terms of ball skills, and allow countless balls to get the best impression, which is really commendable.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the court</p>
<p>After Jin Botao was accused in the Hualian Shantou team match, he took the blame and resigned, and he has not been seen as a referee for a long time. He appeared again yesterday, and he was very energetic, and he is still a progressive basketball referee.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in addition to the fellow villagers from Shantou, there were many basketball comrades, including Chen Zuoliang, Chen Liuzhen, Wu Zibin, Huang Mingyuan, and Zhang Jinlong.</p>
<p>The cheers of the fellow villagers from Shantou were unprecedented.</p>
<p>The order on the court was entirely the responsibility of the Shantou team, which was very well organized. (Sow)</p>
