<h3>驅敵人離開東亞　以把握勝利之年　日首相與各國交歡廣播</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日小磯首相分與大東亞各國間之交歡廣播詞，大意如次：大東亞戰爭於茲巳迎第四新春，計敵軍於，而今菲律賓全島已成決戰塲，爲護國而犧牲之日軍將兵，以特攻隊爲先導，全軍以特攻精神繼續奮鬥，當此秋也，歐洲盟邦德國于歐洲，在政戰兩略上已有大轉變，故吾人對此盟邦滿腔表示敬意，決于共同之理想下，向完遂保衛東亞之途邁進。滿洲國國運益爲日隆，以大東亞戰爭兵站之地位，于軍需生產上，食糧上，貢獻莫大。中華民國雖遭偉大指導者汪主席仙逝，然現在陳代主席領導之下，團結益形鞏固，舉國總力破除英美勢力及建設國內，實徹中日同盟條約之精神，着着實現。泰國自大東亞戰爭爆發以來，於日泰同盟條約下，幾經苦難，目下於阿巴溫首相領導下，持不變之決意，爲防衛大東亞及建設大東亞正義而奮鬥。又緬甸國因敵人蹂躪國土，已成爲防衛東亞之第一錢，全體國民爲獲得光榮之獨立，不屈不撓，並爲建設大東亞正義之一切苦難而戰爭。此外，化爲日。美兩軍決戰塲之菲律賓，亦於洛勒爾大總統領導下，全菲一千六百萬人民，爲獲得自主獨立之宿願，於悲壯之決意下，與日軍協力，迎擊敵人，本人對如此健鬥之大東亞各國國民諸君，衷心表示敬意，仍望今後繼續不止，如此外爲順應盟邦德國之勝利，大東亞團結一致，爲保衛東亞，不顧生死，一致奮鬥。內則後方一億同胞，爲嚮應前綫將兵，唯有繼續增强戰力，英勇敢鬥，吾人之必勝態勢，不得稍動，本年即驅逐敵人離開東亞天地，把握勝利之年。</p>

<h3>展望戰局的現階段（二）　上海日本陸海外三報道部長座談</h3>
<p>松平：綜合兩部長的談話，大東亞戰爭的現况大體是道樣的，就是：前年以來，敵軍特別在太平洋方面繼續反攻。而隱忍自重的我方艦隊，則以逸待勞，於適當的時機中一舉轉取攻勢，同時在大陸方面也爲了摧毀美空軍的基地而展開新的攻勢，而且已經非常成功。至於雙方的航空戰，正如剛才所說，對於補給戰有極大的關係。敵美太平洋方面的補給，想必更難於橫渡大西洋以補給歐洲。松島部長，你說是不是？敵美的補給不是相當困難嗎？</p>
<p>物量無效　敵難補給</p>
<p>松島：是的，相差甚大。最近據敵方的報道，太平洋方面補給大體比大西洋方面難三倍。目下，太平洋作戰的主要基地當然要推夏威夷，此外馬里亞納及澳洲也不失爲重要的基地，不過，推進現在的攻勢作戰的主要力量，仍在夏威夷，而其前進基地則在馬紹爾，烏爾希。敵方本擬設其前進基地於帛琉，哈爾馬黑拉方面，因受挫折，未能依照計畫進行。結果，軍需物資的補給遂不得不以夏威夷爲根據了。此外，與補給有表裘關係的，便是破損艦船的修理也須駛回夏威夷才能施行。但從距離上來　，夏威夷到馬里亞納計四千哩，馬里亞納到菲律賓的一千哩，所以非維持五千哩的海上交通綫不可。若用每時十四哩的運輸船，需時在兩個星期以上，一個月還不能打來回。因此，美國縱然誇稱擁有商船很多，也要感到困難的。這一次的作戰以前，制空權常在對方手中，目下則敵美一近菲島便會立刻受到我方飛機的攻擊，而其機動部隊所依仗的航空母艦，也因我方航空部隊及陸海特攻隊的猛攻而逐漸滅少，現已減到十隻左右，所以祗好借重中繼基地，從新幾內亞北岸的霍朗地亞出必阿克島，再由必阿克島通過摩洛泰島方面在其制空權下的海道而接近菲島，乘隙偸偸運入雷伊泰島。敵美補給的困難由此可以想見。由於這個緣故，第一綫所需的砲彈甚感缺乏，前幾天麥克沃塞司令部因彈藥消耗量很大，曾令前綫竭力節省彈藥。而羅斯福，馬歇爾，金格等敵美最高首腦者也聲稱彈藥缺乏，例如羅斯福在十一月末就已宣稱目前第一綫的砲彈非常缺乏，乃因從事軍需工業的工人不肯努力的緣故。在雷伊泰方面，十一月下半個月的彈藥消耗量，和過去十八個月即瓜達爾下那爾反攻以來美軍所用的砲彈消耗量相等。前綫的彈藥消耗率旣然如此之大，補充起來自然困難，結果敵美的攻勢作戰漸趨澀滯而吿衰退。這點就是物量縱然豐富，倘若補給問題未能完全解決，要想取得現代戰爭的勝利仍是非常困難的一個反證。敵方屢屢歌頌北歐上陸作戰的成功，那是因爲在極近的英國本部有很大補給基地的緣故，而在太平洋方面，其距離的長大實不可相提並論。從現代戰爭完全是物量戰，消耗戰這點來說，補給的難易結果可以決定戰爭的歸趨。美國的作戰，在補給問題上行將碰壁，這是我們可以預期的。</p>
<p>松平：是呀。最近美國軍需工業生產量華盛頓去，分爲五組，遍訪各軍需工廠，鼓勵工人增產軍需品。其後，十二月一日軍需補給部長索瑪維爾等在波斯頓演說時，聲稱要想把歐洲所經騐到的實現於太平洋方面，簡直是不可能的。因而迄今所定造的武器等，全部取消，另造新的。總之，美國軍需生產大體已低下四成。而且爲了補給這些，必須立刻要有十萬名勞工，所以正陷於非常的補給困難中。結果，想改爲和平產業的軍需工廠祇好作罷，在前幾天已經採取緊急措置了。敵美陸軍部隊的補給也仰仗夏威夷嗎？麥克沃塞方面所需的一部分是從澳洲運來的嗎？</p>
<p>松島：以那處爲中繼地的。要之，美國的物資先運到澳洲，然後再由澳洲運出；但結局總是經由夏威夷的。</p>
<p>松平：近頃，據澳洲某大臣發表，澳洲非常缺煤，鐵道存煤不足兩星期之用，煤氣所需也不敷一屋期之用。此外，火腿醃肉也很少。由此　來，不是從澳洲運出相常的食糧品嗎？</p>
<p>救援無途　物資缺乏</p>
<p>松島：運出的吧。澳洲已相當貧乏了，想像以外那樣。因爲英國本部運來的就已不够，何况還要將民生物資運出去呢。</p>
<p>出淵：曾經用B29運輸給養品到中國大陸來哩。</p>
<p>松平：將它當作運輸用的飛機啦。</p>
<p>出淵：據說最近B29出擊的數目因此減少了。大陸上的最大運輸綫，就是緬甸的萊多公路，敵方正在力謀打通此綫。此路如通，想必有相當的物資可以運輸了。目前是專賴空輸的。</p>
<p>松平：空輸數量如何？</p>
<p>出淵：一個月二萬噸。</p>
<p>松島：但大部分是供給渝美空軍的，分給渝軍的不過百分之十，大體還不够渝軍七師一月戰鬥之需。</p>
<p>松平：的確，的確。補給眞難呀！</p>
<p>松島：一百架B29飛到日本九州附近空襲一次，所需的物資如用從來的運輸機運送，那就必須數千架，若用B29，則可減少運輸的機數，而出擊的期間也可加速。根據迄今的統計，以百架飛機空襲日本的爲兩星期一次。最近納爾遜等到重慶去了以後，在那邊設立了戰時生產局，但這正如重　坦白宣布一樣，着重於戰後，決計來不及應酬當面的急需。據延安的廣播，增强生產有四個條件，就是原料資源·勞力·生產機構及運輸，其中重慶所有者祗是勞力一項，其餘全在日軍掌握中。在這種狀况之下，不論設置多少戰時生產局，也不能够增强生產，結果，這無非是美國用意頗深的制覇大陸的一種手段，當然救不了目前物資貧乏的渝軍。</p>
<p>松平：對渝的飛機補給如何？</p>
<p>松島：這兩三個月來已經減少了。</p>
<p>松平：汽油不够吧。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>怎樣實踐政治競賽</h3>
<p>昨天我們在「元旦獻辭」裏提出了「政治競賽」的口號，競賽的目標，即以我們所主張的革新政治—强力政治，專家政治，親民政治，廉潔政治四個原則作爲基點。這也正是今年　我們的具體工作方向。</p>
<p>應該怎樣着手競賽呢？</p>
<p>我們必須從多方面去作競賽：</p>
<p>第一，我們要向盟邦競追。盟邦政治比我國健全得多，目前的決戰政治，尤比我國强上無數倍，然而盟邦當局却仍在强益求强，從事更圖上進。我們現在雖然還不能與盟邦並頭相競，但應該趕快迎頭追上去，向盟邦學習，吸取盟邦政治上的優點之適合於我國國情者，積極努力去做。同時，我們並應與大東亞其他各國相競賽，大家學習盟邦。</p>
<p>第二，我們要與重慶競賽。目前重慶所以還能勉强拖戰下去，除依靠敵美英等支持外，當也有它的政治基礎。國內一部份政治勢力和社會勢力現仍和重慶相結托着，而一部份人民，也仍被重慶麻醉着，利用着。若干政治勢力如小黨派及代表某些社會階層的社團，固然也並不滿意重慶，對於重慶的政治，非常痛心疾首，可是因爲我們和平區裏的努力太不够，還太缺乏成績表現，所以不能把他們爭取過來。我們現在必須切切實實做得好，使他們一心一意傾向我們，從而瓦解重慶。人民方面，祇要我們能够的確比重慶做得好，他們當然也會傾向過來的。所以要和重慶競賽，爭取政治力量，爭取人民</p>
<p>第三，我們要與共黨競賽。現在緊接於和平區的不少地方，常爲共黨勢力所盤踞，阻撓全面和平。共黨常利用巧妙的宣傳及針對我們的弱點，鼓動民衆，離間民衆。共黨又長於向民衆「假討好」，但我們連一點也沒做到。我們一定要以「眞好」，來壓倒共黨的「假好」。鄰近共黨盤踞區域而易被共黨分子侵入活動的地方，特別要與中共競賽，爭取地方羣衆。祗要能够把羣衆爭取過來，共黨就將難以立足</p>
<p>第四，我們要從事工作競賽。　　比誰做得好，做得更好。中央和地方，應遵照整個政治工作綱領，上競下賽，中央拿模範的表率，領導地方，地方拿實際的成績，報答中央。地方和地方也要競賽，省與省間，縣與縣間，應朝着共同目標，競相努力。各政治機關之間，及長官和下屬，以至個人和個人間，也必須依據各自的工作本位，相互競賽。</p>
<p>至在競賽之間，我們應具良好的競賽精神。向盟邦學習的競賽，主要的是虛心，對敵人競賽，要發揮堅毅的鬥爭性。而自己入的競賽，則絕下應帶有猜忌，更不應傾軋，在競賽中要包含協力。一定須期求大家都做得好，不是僅一個單位好，或一個好，這是應當特別了解淸楚的。</p>
<p>我們於上面闡釋了競賽關係之後，進一步還必須研究競賽中的具體工作，容另文申論之。</p>
<h3>日軍航空部隊　猛攻敵船團　同時轟炸雷島兩機塲</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地一日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，向企圖增援明多羅島登陸敵軍之敵運輸船團，連日加以攻擊，巳收相當戰果，同時，對桑霍塞敵機塲亦反覆加以痛炸，其戰果據三十一日偵察，桑霍塞敵機塲一時曾存有飛機百三十架乃至百五十架，然今日南機塲減至僅存大到機一架，北機塲僅存有小型機十二架，被損者約二十架而已。又敵艦船情况，桑霍塞灣南方有起火及擱淺之大型運輸船各一艘，然該灣內三十日尙起火焚燒中之敵運輸船二艘，今已消姿而沉沒，再者，東方海面已完全無敵艦船之踪跡矣。</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍某基地一日中央社電　日軍航空部隊三十日曾攻擊雷伊泰島塔拉克，塔克羅班兩機場及其附近設施，同時，對該海面之敵小舟艇，亦作低空掃射轟炸。又敵陸地設施有數所亦中彈爆炸起火。</p>
<h3>滿國務總理　新歲祝辭　願與盟邦緊密協力</h3>
<p>中央社訊：滿洲國張國務總理以我國參戰紀念轉瞬即屆，特以「極願與盟邦各國同心協力擊滅英美」爲題，談其決意如决：迎此決勝之新年，滿洲國與盟邦諸國同心協力打倒美英之決意，亦因而一新。誠以大東亞戰爭乃解放全東亞之正義戰，若不澈底粉碎敵英美制羈東洋之野心，則建設東亞人之東亞永不可能。且自有史以來，師出無名者，無不遭敗北之慘，故勝利則常爲主持正義人道者所握有，此乃吾等所確信而弗疑者。我滿洲國早知解放東亞自應負之使命，故自開戰以來，即舉總力以從事於增强戰力與維護北邊之兩大使命。當國民政府於前年一月與美英宣戰時，我國朝野即非常感佩，蓋中國之參戰，適與我國所持之正義目的如出一轍，敵美英恃其物量，毫無顧慮，擬逞其侵略東亞之野心，如於菲律賓強行作戰，固勿庸論，而連年驅使渝軍繼續抗日，猶以爲不足，更擬將渝收歸美軍指揮之下，事實昭然若揭，而欲將此頑敵打倒，建設東亞人之東亞，實在於我大東亞十億民衆與豐富之資源團結一致，共同以赴不爲功。蓋敵這物量雖不可悔，而我等具有正義團結精神，幷有世界精强無比之日軍，更加之偌大之人的與物的資源，必可與敵英美周旋，且吾人鑑於物量補給戰之情況，吾人應增強綜合戰力以呼應日軍之勇戰，此即吾人重大之責務。幸我滿洲國因十餘年之建設，各項生產力皆已顯著加強，尤其近年更爲猛進。政府方面除對當前之重大決戰有直接貢劇外，幷決定預料可及之第二第三決戰之緊急增產方案逐步實施。農產物一項由於官民之努力，去年本年皆大豐收。其豐收狀况亦頗良好。龐大之目標量在十二月初旬，即已達成八成以上，近將完成全部收獲而具有充分之確信，幷可用慰中日兩國之期待，殊値同慶，明年度決定實行緊急農地開闢，更決定各項計劃以實現更强大之增產。關於鑛業方面如鐵煤炭輕金屬人造液體燃料及飛機等，於直接增强戰力上繼續有驚人之進步，駐渝美空軍之空製企圖，亦未得破壞我從業員之增產精神，更對中國方面對我鋼鐵增產之協力表明謝意。又關於煤炭輕金屬及其他重要物資，亦已樹立增產目標，我國民之必勝信念及勤勉之國民性，必可以達成。且今日之生產增强，在於加强擊潰英美之大東亞綜合戰力，中滿兩國乃大陸之中樞，故更應行有無相通，向增强戰力之途邁進。中滿兩國國交，逐年緊密，殊堪同慶，今後更於此重大戰局下致力親善，與盟邦相提携，向擊滅英美之途邁進。</p>
<h3>德元首新年演說　堅持勝利信念　直至敵人崩潰爲止</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　海通社訊：德元首希特勒在電台向德國人民發表新年演說稱：世人須知德國永不投降，今日之德國與昔日之所有大國無異，在途中或須遭遇挫折，但從不離去其路徑，德國人民自有史以來，即爲歐洲及世界歷史中最重要之因素，今日如是，將來尤爲新。敵方政客及記者之誇大，德人已知，倘敵人失敗將進遇何種命運，德人不致戰敗，決心獲致勝利。敵人之炸毀德國城市，不但欲屠殺德之婦孺，亦欲毀來千年來德國之文化，此種文化，乃敵人所不能產生者，屆時敵人之摧毀德國文化，將繼續燃燒吾人之記憶，但終自知其無取。由於一九四四年之戰事，可知財閥制度之社會，已不能對付今日及未來之風雨。自由時代已成過去，民主主義之復活已完全失敗，各國之未能覓得社會改造之眞正途徑者勢必演亂。歐洲現正遭遇經濟國家種族之威脅，德是賴，能作此種鉅大犧牲者，惟廢止一切特權之社會制度始能之。全體人民不但須肩負同等責職，亦須負荷同等權利，此項信念之意義，及明悟德人生存鬥爭之目的，使彼本人在此困苦時期，以最强之信心及不移之信念，增强賡續作戰之力量。關於總力動員，希氏稱，被敵人以超人之勤奮與英勇再新建造，將來亦將如是，直至敵人崩潰之日爲止。</p>
<h3>法政府要求　兼併德領土</h3>
<p>日內瓦一日中央社電　德國社訊：日內瓦日報論述法國將來之萊因河政策，透露法國要求參加管理爲保護法德邊境而設立之組織，法國又要求將與法境接壤之德國地方，交與法國直接管理一長久之時期。凡此種種問題，己由特戈爾與斯達林及羅斯福加以討論。日本海軍新銳飛機雄姿</p>

<h3>湊海軍武官長　發表歲首辭　軍民一體粉碎英美野心</h3>
<p>日駐滬在勤海軍武官長湊少將發表歲首辭云；</p>
<p>於迎接皇紀二千六百零五年新春時之第一個感想，本年乃決定皇國存亡興廢之一年，故須傾注必死之努力，打開勝利大道，以副聖旨。回顧過去一年間，敵人漸次振作陣容，自吉爾貝特及新幾內亞方面，向塞班，關島，　羅泰諸地進攻，今則菲律賓中部正於激烈之交戰中，以前於塞班島，臺灣，及菲律賓海面三次海空大戰中，我海陸空軍曾緊密聯繫，共同作戰，予敵美太平洋艦隊以制命攻擊，造成我方有利之局勢，商方則結集其殘餘艦隊及糾合別國之艦隊，雜湊成軍，焦躁挑戰，由菲律賓以至中國之途，急直企圖進佔，我方則誘敵大軍，至近距離內，隨時可捕此甕中之龜，此菲律賓方面，所以展開激戰也。敵因菲律賓攻略上之關係，以精鍊之二十個師團之大半來攻雷伊泰明多羅兩島，而衛皇國，保衛東亞，必置傲敵於死地。今一年又過，思及無數勇士之偉大精神，不禁心驚肉跳，而熱血上湧矣。所望東亞十億民族，一致能體殺身成仁之大義，粉碎英美覇領東亞之野心，配置全員戰鬥之凖備，堅實前綫後方，爲對抗敵方之物量，尤須挺身認立業陣中，祈於本年度必有勝利之實現。</p>

<h3>Drive the Enemy Away From East Asia: To Seize the Year of Victory; Japanese Prime Minister Broadcasts Exchanges with Various Countries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The gist of Japanese Prime Minister Koiso's broadcast of exchanges with various countries in Greater East Asia is as follows: The Greater East Asia War has now entered its fourth new spring. The enemy forces... and now the entire island of the Philippines has become a decisive battleground. Japanese soldiers, sacrificing themselves to protect the country, led by special attack units, continue to fight with special attack spirit. At this time, Germany, our European ally, has undergone major changes in both political and strategic aspects in Europe. Therefore, we express our full respect to this ally and resolve to advance towards the path of completing the defense of East Asia under a common ideal. The national fortune of Manchukuo is becoming increasingly prosperous. As a logistics base for the Greater East Asia War, it has made significant contributions to military production and food supplies. Although the Republic of China suffered the passing of its great leader, Chairman Wang, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, unity has become more consolidated. The whole country is making all-out efforts to eliminate the influence of Britain and the United States and to build the country, thoroughly implementing the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and achieving results step by step. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Thailand, under the Thai-Japanese Alliance Treaty, has undergone many hardships. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Abhaiwongse, it maintains an unwavering determination to fight for the defense of Greater East Asia and the construction of Greater East Asia's justice. Furthermore, Burma, due to the enemy's ravaging of its territory, has become the front line of defense in East Asia. All its people are unyielding and fighting for the glory of independence and for all the hardships of constructing Greater East Asia's justice. In addition, the Philippines, which has become the decisive battleground between Japanese and American forces, under the leadership of President Laurel, all 16 million Filipinos, with a tragic determination to achieve their long-cherished desire for autonomy and independence, are cooperating with the Japanese army to resist the enemy. I express my heartfelt respect to the people of all these fighting countries in Greater East Asia and hope that they will continue to do so. In order to follow the victory of our ally Germany, Greater East Asia must unite as one, fight for the defense of East Asia regardless of life or death. Internally, 100 million compatriots in the home front must continue to strengthen their war efforts and fight bravely to respond to the soldiers on the front lines. Our certainty of victory must not waver. This year, we will drive the enemy away from the lands of East Asia and seize the year of victory.</p>
<h3>Frontline Japanese Troops: Crushing Enemy Attempts</h3>
<p>Burma, 1st (Central News Agency) – A certain unit of the Japanese army on the Burmese front, near 30 kilometers west of Kaduma, has been engaged in fierce battles since the 24th of last month against a unit of the Eastern Philippine Army's 15th Division, numbering several hundred, carrying several tanks, attempting to advance eastward in the Kalewa area, crushing the enemy's attempt. However, on the 28th, the enemy reinforced with dozens of tanks and 300 transport vehicles, a force of about 3,000, attempting to break through the Japanese line. After Japanese reinforcements arrived, the two sides are now engaged in fierce battles.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Completes His Business: Returns to Nanjing from Japan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Foreign Minister Chu, who accompanied Acting Chairman Chen on a visit to Japan in mid-December last year, was later ordered to go to Nagoya to thank the authorities of the hospital where the late Chairman Wang was treated, and to attend the memorial service held there. He has now completed his mission and returned to the capital on New Year's Eve of the 33rd year.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Current Stage of the War (2): A Discussion Between the Heads of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Information Departments of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Matsudaira: Summarizing the talks of both department heads, the current situation of the Greater East Asia War is roughly as follows: Since the year before last, the enemy has continued to counterattack, especially in the Pacific region. Our fleet, enduring and biding its time, is waiting for the opportune moment to launch an all-out offensive. At the same time, on the mainland, we have launched a new offensive to destroy the bases of the American air force, and it has been very successful. As for the air war between the two sides, as just mentioned, it has a great relationship with the supply war. The enemy's supply in the Pacific is presumably more difficult than crossing the Atlantic to supply Europe. Department Head Matsushima, would you agree? Is the enemy's supply not quite difficult?</p>
<p>Ineffective Material Resources: Enemy Difficult to Supply</p>
<p>Matsushima: Yes, the difference is significant. According to recent enemy reports, supply in the Pacific is roughly three times more difficult than in the Atlantic. Currently, the main base of operations in the Pacific is of course Hawaii. In addition, the Mariana Islands and Australia are also important bases. However, the main force driving the current offensive operations is still Hawaii, and its forward bases are in the Marshall Islands and Ulithi. The enemy originally intended to establish its forward bases in Palau and Halmahera, but due to setbacks, it failed to proceed according to plan. As a result, the supply of military supplies had to be based in Hawaii. In addition, related to supply is the repair of damaged ships, which must also be returned to Hawaii to be carried out. But in terms of distance, Hawaii to the Mariana Islands is 4,000 miles, and the Mariana Islands to the Philippines is 1,000 miles, so it is necessary to maintain a 5,000-mile maritime communication line. If using a transport ship traveling at 14 miles per hour, it would take more than two weeks, and a round trip could not be made in a month. Therefore, even if the United States boasts of having many merchant ships, it will still feel the difficulty. Before this operation, air supremacy was often in the hands of the enemy. Now, as soon as the enemy approaches the Philippines, it will immediately be attacked by our aircraft. The aircraft carriers on which its mobile units rely are also gradually decreasing due to the fierce attacks of our air force and naval special attack units, and have now been reduced to about ten. Therefore, they have to rely on intermediate bases, passing through Hollandia on the north coast of New Guinea to Biak Island, and then from Biak Island through the waters under their air supremacy in the Molotai Islands area to approach the Philippines, secretly transporting supplies to Leyte Island. The difficulty of the enemy's supply can be imagined. Due to this reason, there is a great lack of artillery shells required on the front line. A few days ago, the MacArthur headquarters, due to the large consumption of ammunition, ordered the front line to make every effort to save ammunition. Roosevelt, Marshall, King, and other enemy and American leaders also claimed that ammunition was lacking. For example, Roosevelt declared at the end of November that artillery shells on the front line are very lacking, due to the fact that workers engaged in military industry are unwilling to work hard. In the Leyte area, the amount of ammunition consumed in the second half of November was equal to the amount of artillery shells used by the American army since the counterattack from Guadalcanal in the past eighteen months. Since the consumption rate of ammunition on the front line is so high, it is naturally difficult to replenish it. As a result, the enemy's offensive operations are gradually becoming stagnant and declining. This is a counter-proof that even if material resources are abundant, it is still very difficult to win a modern war if the supply problem is not completely resolved. The enemy has repeatedly praised the success of the landing operation in Northern Europe, because there is a large supply base very close to the British headquarters. In the Pacific, the length of the distance is incomparable. From the point of view that modern warfare is completely a war of material resources and a war of attrition, the ease or difficulty of supply can ultimately determine the outcome of the war. We can expect that the American operation will run into a wall in terms of supply.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Yes. Recently, the American military industry production volume... Washington was divided into five groups, visiting various military factories to encourage workers to increase the production of military supplies. Later, when Minister of Military Supply Somervell and others spoke in Boston on December 1, they claimed that it was simply impossible to realize what they had experienced in Europe in the Pacific. Therefore, all the weapons that had been ordered were canceled and new ones were being made. In short, American military production has generally decreased by 40%. Moreover, in order to supply these, 100,000 laborers are needed immediately, so they are in a very difficult supply situation. As a result, the military factories that wanted to switch to peaceful industries had to give up, and emergency measures had already been taken a few days ago. Does the enemy and American army's supply also rely on Hawaii? Is part of what the MacArthur side needs shipped from Australia?</p>
<p>Matsushima: That place is used as a relay point. In short, the American materials are first transported to Australia, and then shipped out from Australia; but in the end, they always pass through Hawaii.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Recently, according to a certain minister in Australia, Australia is very short of coal, with less than two weeks' worth of coal for the railways, and not enough gas for a house period. In addition, there is very little ham. From this point of view, isn't a considerable amount of food being shipped out of Australia?</p>
<p>No Way to Rescue: Lack of Supplies</p>
<p>Matsushima: It is being shipped out. Australia is already quite poor, more so than imagined. Because what is shipped from the British headquarters is not enough, let alone shipping out civilian supplies.</p>
<p>Ide: They once used B29s to transport supplies to mainland China.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Using them as transport planes.</p>
<p>Ide: It is said that the number of B29 sorties has decreased recently because of this. The largest transportation line on the mainland is the Ledo Road in Burma. The enemy is trying to open this line. If this road is open, presumably a considerable amount of supplies can be transported. Currently, they rely solely on air transport.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: How much is transported by air?</p>
<p>Ide: 20,000 tons per month.</p>
<p>Matsushima: But most of it is supplied to the American air force in Chongqing. Only 10% is given to the Chongqing army, which is generally not enough for the needs of seven divisions of the Chongqing army for one month of combat.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Indeed, indeed. Supply is really difficult!</p>
<p>Matsushima: If 100 B29s fly to the vicinity of Kyushu, Japan, to bomb once, the materials required, if transported by conventional transport planes, would require thousands of planes. If using B29s, the number of transport planes can be reduced, and the period of sorties can also be accelerated. According to statistics to date, 100 planes bomb Japan once every two weeks. Recently, after Nelson and others went to Chongqing, they established a wartime production bureau there. But this, as Chongqing frankly announced, focuses on the post-war period and will definitely not be in time to meet the urgent needs at hand. According to Yan'an's broadcast, there are four conditions for increasing production, namely raw material resources, labor, production facilities, and transportation. Among them, Chongqing only possesses labor, and the rest are all in the hands of the Japanese army. Under these circumstances, no matter how many wartime production bureaus are set up, they cannot increase production. As a result, this is nothing more than a means by which the United States intends to dominate the mainland. Of course, it cannot save the Chongqing army from its current poverty of supplies.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: How is the air supply to Chongqing?</p>
<p>Matsushima: It has decreased in the past two or three months.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Not enough gasoline, right?</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Practice Political Competition</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in our "New Year's Message," we put forward the slogan of "Political Competition." The goal of the competition is to use the four principles of innovative politics that we advocate—strong politics, expert politics, pro-people politics, and clean politics—as the basis. This is also our specific working direction for this year.</p>
<p>How should we start the competition?</p>
<p>We must compete from many aspects:</p>
<p>First, we must compete with our allies. The politics of our allies are much sounder than ours. The current decisive battle politics are countless times stronger than ours. However, the allied authorities are still seeking to strengthen and improve. Although we cannot yet compete with our allies side by side, we should quickly catch up, learn from our allies, absorb the advantages of their politics that are suitable for our national conditions, and actively work to do so. At the same time, we should also compete with other countries in Greater East Asia, and everyone should learn from our allies.</p>
<p>Second, we must compete with Chongqing. The reason why Chongqing can barely continue the war is that, in addition to relying on the support of the enemy, the United States, and Britain, it also has its political foundation. A part of the political and social forces in the country are still colluding with Chongqing, and a part of the people are still being anesthetized and exploited by Chongqing. Some political forces, such as small parties and social groups representing certain social classes, are certainly dissatisfied with Chongqing and are very saddened by Chongqing's politics. However, because our efforts in the peaceful areas are not enough and we still lack achievements, we cannot win them over. We must now do well in a practical and concrete way, so that they will wholeheartedly tend towards us, thereby disintegrating Chongqing. As for the people, as long as we can do better than Chongqing, they will naturally tend towards us. Therefore, we must compete with Chongqing to win political forces and win the people.</p>
<p>Third, we must compete with the communists. In many places adjacent to the peaceful areas, they are often occupied by communist forces, hindering overall peace. The communists often use clever propaganda and target our weaknesses to incite the masses and alienate them. The communists are also good at "pretending to please" the masses, but we have not even done a little of that. We must use "real goodness" to overwhelm the communists' "fake goodness." Especially in areas near communist-occupied areas that are easily invaded and operated on by communist elements, we must compete with the Chinese Communist Party to win over local masses. As long as we can win over the masses, the communists will find it difficult to gain a foothold.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must engage in work competition. Competing to see who does well and does better. The central and local governments should follow the overall political work program, with the central government setting a model example to lead the local governments, and the local governments repaying the central government with practical achievements. Local governments should also compete with each other. Provinces and counties should strive towards a common goal. Among various political organs, and between superiors and subordinates, and even between individuals, we must also compete with each other based on their respective work positions.</p>
<p>As for the competition, we should have a good competitive spirit. The competition of learning from our allies is mainly humility. Competing with the enemy requires a display of firm struggle. And the competition within ourselves should never involve suspicion, let alone infighting. Cooperation should be included in the competition. We must ensure that everyone does well, not just one unit or one person, which should be especially understood clearly.</p>
<p>After explaining the relationship of competition above, we must further study the specific work in the competition, which will be discussed in another article.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Enemy Convoy: Simultaneously Bombs Two Airfields on Leyte Island</h3>
<p>Philippine Front, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force has been attacking the enemy transport convoy attempting to reinforce the enemy forces landing on Mindoro Island for days, achieving considerable results. At the same time, the San Jose enemy airfield has also been repeatedly bombed. According to the reconnaissance on the 31st, the San Jose enemy airfield once had 130 to 150 aircraft. However, today, the south airfield has been reduced to only one large aircraft, and the north airfield has only twelve small aircraft. About 20 aircraft were damaged. As for the enemy's ships, there is one large transport ship on fire and aground south of San Jose Bay. However, the two enemy transport ships in the bay that were still on fire on the 30th have now disappeared and sunk. Furthermore, there are no traces of enemy ships in the eastern sea.</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force attacked the Tacloban and Dulag airfields on Leyte Island and their nearby facilities on the 30th. At the same time, it also conducted low-altitude strafing and bombing of enemy small boats on the sea. In addition, several enemy land facilities were also hit and exploded, catching fire.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo's Prime Minister's New Year's Greetings: Wishing to Closely Cooperate With Allies</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Manchukuo's Prime Minister Zhang, with the anniversary of our country's participation in the war approaching, specifically addressed the issue of "Willing to Cooperate Closely With Allied Countries to Destroy Britain and the United States" to express his determination as follows: Welcoming this decisive new year, Manchukuo's determination to cooperate with allied countries to defeat the United States and Britain is also renewed. Indeed, the Greater East Asia War is a just war to liberate all of East Asia. If we do not thoroughly crush the ambition of the enemy, Britain and the United States, to control the East, then it will never be possible to build an East Asia for East Asians. Moreover, since the beginning of history, those who have launched wars without a just cause have all suffered disastrous defeats. Therefore, victory is always held by those who uphold justice and humanity. This is what we firmly believe. Manchukuo has long known its mission to liberate East Asia. Therefore, since the beginning of the war, it has used all its strength to engage in the two major missions of enhancing its war capabilities and maintaining the northern borders. When the National Government declared war on the United States and Britain in January of the year before last, our country, both government and people, admired them very much. The participation of China coincided with the just purpose held by our country. Relying on their material resources, the enemy, the United States and Britain, did not hesitate to carry out their ambition to invade East Asia. It goes without saying that they forcibly carried out operations in the Philippines, and even after years of driving the Chongqing army to continue to resist Japan, they still felt it was not enough. They even planned to bring Chongqing under the command of the American army. The facts are clear. In order to defeat this stubborn enemy and build an East Asia for East Asians, it is necessary for our Greater East Asia's billion people to unite together with abundant resources and work together. Although the enemy's material resources cannot be dismissed, we have the spirit of justice and unity, and the world's most elite Japanese army, plus the vast human and material resources, which will surely be able to deal with the enemy, Britain and the United States. Moreover, in view of the situation of the war of material resources and supply, we should strengthen our comprehensive combat capabilities to respond to the brave battles of the Japanese army. This is our important duty. Fortunately, due to more than ten years of construction, the various production capacities of our Manchukuo have been significantly strengthened, especially in recent years. In addition to directly contributing to the current major decisive battles, the government has also decided to gradually implement the emergency production plan for the foreseeable second and third decisive battles. Thanks to the efforts of the government and the people, agricultural products have had bumper harvests in both last year and this year. The situation of the bumper harvest is also quite good. The huge target quantity had already reached more than 80% by early December, and it is about to be completed with full confidence. It can also comfort the expectations of both China and Japan, which is worthy of common celebration. Next year, we will decide to implement emergency farmland development and decide on various plans to achieve even greater production increases. Regarding the mining industry, such as iron, coal, light metals, artificial liquid fuels, and aircraft, there has been continued amazing progress in directly enhancing combat capabilities. The attempt by the American air force stationed in Chongqing to control the air has also failed to destroy the production spirit of our employees. Furthermore, we express our gratitude to China for its cooperation in our increased steel production. We have also set production increase goals for coal, light metals, and other important materials. Our people's belief in victory and the diligent national character will surely be able to achieve them. Moreover, today's production increase lies in strengthening the comprehensive combat capabilities of Greater East Asia to defeat Britain and the United States. China and Manchukuo are the hubs of the mainland. Therefore, there should be mutual understanding and progress towards enhancing combat capabilities. The national relations between China and Manchukuo are becoming closer every year, which is worthy of common celebration. In the future, we will work harder on goodwill under this major war situation, cooperate with our allies, and move towards defeating Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>German Leader's New Year's Speech: Insisting on the Belief in Victory Until the Enemy Collapses</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – HTS News: German leader Hitler delivered a New Year's speech to the German people on the radio, stating: The world must know that Germany will never surrender. Today's Germany is no different from all the great powers of the past. It may encounter setbacks along the way, but it never deviates from its path. Since the beginning of history, the German people have been the most important factor in European and world history. This is the case today, and it will be even more so in the future. The German people know the exaggerations of enemy politicians and journalists. If the enemy fails, they will encounter what kind of fate. The Germans will not be defeated and are determined to achieve victory. The enemy's bombing of German cities not only wants to slaughter German women and children, but also wants to destroy Germany's culture of thousands of years, a culture that the enemy cannot produce. The enemy's destruction of German culture will continue to burn in our memories, but they will eventually know that it is worthless. The war in 1944 shows that the society of the financial system can no longer cope with the storms of today and the future. The era of freedom is over, and the revival of democracy has completely failed. Countries that have failed to find the true path of social transformation will inevitably descend into chaos. Europe is currently facing the threat of economic, national, and racial issues. Germany is the only one that can make such great sacrifices. Only a social system that abolishes all privileges can do this. All the people must not only shoulder equal responsibilities, but also bear equal rights. The meaning of this belief and the understanding of the purpose of the German people's struggle for survival enable them to increase their strength to continue fighting in this difficult period with the strongest confidence and unwavering belief. Regarding all-out mobilization, Hitler stated that it is being rebuilt with superhuman diligence and heroism by the enemy, and it will be the same in the future until the enemy collapses.</p>
<h3>French Government Demands Annexation of German Territory</h3>
<p>Geneva, 1st - Central News Agency - German News: The Geneva Daily News discusses France's future Rhine River policy, revealing that France demands to participate in the management of organizations established to protect the Franco-German border. France also demands that German territories bordering France be placed under French direct administration for an extended period. All these issues have been discussed by Teague, Stalin, and Roosevelt.</p>

<h3>City Residents Enthusiastically Celebrate New Year, Filled with Joyous Festivities</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the New Year's Day of the 34th year of the Republic of China. The city's five million residents, under the mission of defending the Greater East Asia War, celebrated the New Year together. All city agencies and organizations held group greeting ceremonies, and all shops and schools took a holiday, displaying flags in celebration. The national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth fluttered throughout the city, and the streets and alleys were filled with New Year's atmosphere. The enthusiastic celebrations among the people were unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<h3>Naval Attaché Captain Minato Issues New Year's Address: Military and Civilians United to Crush Anglo-American Ambitions</h3>
<p>Naval Attaché Captain Minato, stationed in Shanghai, issued a New Year's address, stating:</p>
<p>As we welcome the New Year of the 2605th year of the Imperial Era, my first thought is that this year will determine the survival and prosperity of our Imperial Nation. Therefore, we must exert every effort to open the path to victory, living up to the Imperial Will. Looking back at the past year, the enemy has gradually strengthened its forces, advancing from the Gilbert and New Guinea areas towards Saipan, Guam, and Rota. Currently, fierce battles are taking place in the central Philippines. In the three major naval and air battles off Saipan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, our naval, army, and air forces worked closely together, launching a decisive attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet, creating a favorable situation for our side. The enemy, on the other hand, gathered its remaining fleet and combined it with fleets from other countries, forming a makeshift force and anxiously challenging us, attempting to advance directly from the Philippines to China. Our side is luring the enemy's main force into close range, ready to capture them like turtles in a jar. This is why fierce battles are unfolding in the Philippines. Due to the strategic importance of the Philippines, the enemy has deployed the majority of its highly trained twenty divisions to attack Leyte and Mindoro. To defend the Imperial Nation and protect East Asia, we must defeat the arrogant enemy. As another year passes, I am deeply moved and filled with fervor when I think of the great spirit of countless warriors. I hope that the 1 billion people of East Asia can unite in upholding the great cause of sacrificing themselves for righteousness, crush the Anglo-American ambition to dominate East Asia, prepare for all-out combat, and strengthen both the front lines and the rear. To counter the enemy's material strength, we must step forward and establish ourselves in the battlefield, praying for the realization of victory in this year.</p>

<h3>China-Portugal Cup Soccer Match Opens Yesterday, Chinese Team Defeated, Portuguese Team Wins 4-2</h3>
<p>The China-Portugal Cup soccer match opened at 10:00 AM yesterday at the Yiyuan Stadium on Xianyang Road. China played against Portugal in the first match, and the audience flocked to the stadium, filling it to capacity. Dai Linjing, Xu Wenkui, Song Lingsheng, and Xin Fuzhen of the Chinese team were unable to play due to injuries, which greatly affected their strength, especially the center-back line. Portugal played with the original lineup of Portuguese businessmen, who were very organized. After a hard-fought battle, the Chinese team was惨 defeatted 2-4, with the score tied 1-1 at halftime. Referee Xuan Zhengzhu blew the whistle to start the game, and Kang Bo presided over the opening ceremony. Han Longhai of the Chinese vanguard missed an open goal, which was an ominous omen. Bauchoet of the Portuguese team attacked the center, shooting from 20 yards, but fortunately, it was a foot above the goal. Jia Youliang passed to Old Sun, and Pan Limi failed to save it, hitting the right corner. The Portuguese team counterattacked, with great momentum. Fuen Bauchoet attacked the goal several times, but either hit the post or the crossbar, turning danger into safety. At 39 minutes, Bauchoet suddenly became active, Zheng Yingquan失職, and Bauchoet calmly shot in, with each side scoring one goal in the first half. In the second half, the Portuguese team continued to be rampant, and within three minutes, Suro scored another goal. The Chinese team launched a combined attack, and Li Yichen tried a long shot but missed. Soon after, Jia Youliang hooked the ball in, and Han Longhai headed it in, making it 2-2. The Chinese team was exhausted, and the center-back line was suddenly cut off. Suro single-handedly darted in, and Zhang Lingen could not stop him. Suro swept across the ground and scored, making it 3-2. The Chinese team made a desperate effort, but Sun Jinshun's iron legs were ineffective, creating an opportunity for Portugal. Pan Detsen passed the ball into the center, and Suro shot hard. Zhang Banglun knew it was impossible to save, and the ball entered the net. As time ran out, Portugal defeated China 4-2.</p>

<p>Nantong College Collective Fundraising</p>
<p>A letter from all the scholarship students of Nantong College stated: "We are writing to inform you that fundraising for scholarships is the personal responsibility of the scholarship students, and we cannot shirk it. The students of the two departments of agriculture and textiles in our school have generously donated and raised three teams, but the amount is not enough, and we have failed to meet your warm expectations. We are very sorry. However, this time, thanks to the appeal on behalf of students Zhu Juncai, Chen Benxiang, and Zhou Erren, we have benefited a lot. And thanks to the promise of students Zhang Xiaozhong and Chen Zuqi to fundraise outside the school, we are especially grateful. However, it is still in progress, and the time is short, so we will send the received funds first. Please check and receive."</p>

<h3>Madame Wang in Shanghai Talks About the Gold Donation for Aircraft Purchase</h3>
<p>Madame Wang, Committee Member Chen, arrived in Shanghai on the 29th to visit her daughter's illness. The reporter visited her private residence during New Year's Day and expressed his condolences. When asked about the gold donation for aircraft purchase reported in yesterday's newspaper, she gave a very detailed account. The day of the gold donation happened to be the seventh day after the death of the late Chairman Wang. In order to show that we should complete the late Chairman Wang's ambition to end the Greater East Asia War, and because the increase in aircraft is an essential element in winning the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, she specifically donated 5 million yuan to increase the production of aircraft to assist the war effort. At that time, Madame Wang was unwell, so she specifically contacted the highest advisor of the National Government and asked him to send someone to negotiate. Madame Wang personally wrote the main points and instructed the secretary on duty to convey this meaning. The reporter also received from Madame Wang a draft of the main points, which originally stated: "(1) Yesterday was the seventh day after the death of Mr., and I donated 5 million yuan in national currency to the Greater East Asia War for the manufacture of aircraft. (2) The aircraft manufactured with this money should be used in the Pacific region, and especially hoped to be used in the Philippine battlefield." Madame Wang especially emphasized the second point above. The reporter further asked who was with Madame Wang when she went to the Allied Headquarters, but did not know at the time. Madame Wang replied: "I have never been there."</p>
