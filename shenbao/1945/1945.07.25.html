<h3>三馬林達公路附近雙方展開肉搏戰峇厘巴板西北敵繼續增援</h3>
<p>太平洋基地二十四日中央社電　峇厘巴板方面之敵軍已獲得增援，二十一日最以迫擊砲野砲等轟擊日軍第一綫陣地，總有約一中隊敵軍分數隊前來攻擊，日軍均將其學退。又二十二日敵繼續攻勢，刻雙方展開激戰中。二十一，二十二兩日內日軍之戰果，殺傷敵兵約三百三十名</p>
<p>南方前綫基地二十四日中央社電峇厘巴板戰綫，前曾一時呈對峙狀態，但二十日以來，日美兩軍突於三馬林達公路附近重演激戰，日軍守備部隊對敵陵缺加以肉搏，强襲敵陣，使敵蒙莫大損害。二十二日敵軍一部又復於峇厘巴板西北二十一公里之田巴頓附近，以小型船五艘開始登陸增援。</p>
<h3>日軍突擊予敵重創</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地二十四日中央社電　敵爲企圖奪還峇厘巴板之油田地帶，但爲三馬林達公路之日軍縱深陣地所遏，不能前進。最近敵軍開拓该公路兩傍之密林，企圖進迫日陣，但刻下對峙在三馬林達八公里地點之兩軍戰綫，相距僅五十米至十五米，日軍利用此點，乃於十人日迄二十日派出敢死隊衝入敵陣，殲敵二百餘名，使敵戰力消耗。例如日軍岡本等三名曾於笠山之戰鬥中，抱地雷衝入相距僅四十米之敵陳，卒摧燬敵戰車二輛。又日軍林水兵長以地雷破壞敵大型戰車一輛，又日軍三哨兵亦以炸裂筒攻擊敵軍集團，一舉殺傷敵兵五十名。釜井隊對於機守水源地北方之敵一中隊，施行肉搏衝殺，中村淺一一等兵曹以下十名勇士突人敵軍背後，斬敵十五名，占領敵軍陣地。又釜井隊會於森巴基亞油田丘陵地帶開砲猛轟，伴同敵軍一中隊將之殲滅。又小峯大尉率領之突擊隊巧妙急　敵軍陣地，　毀敵砲車七輛等之勇猛果敢奮戰，令敵極度恐怖云。</p>
<h3>日本士南方海面敵激動部隊蠢動　襲吳港敵機擊墜毀三十架</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　敵繼動部隊于本月十日侵入日本近海，對關東以北之北海道方面各地區，主要以艦載機實施轟炸，其後該機動部隊更轟炸日各地區，同時仍游弋于本土近海，忽隱忽現，行踪莫測，現已漸向日本土南方海面行動。二十四日于東海地區以西之海面開始轟動，　二十四日敵方作戰，不專以繼上機刑動，敵之小型機內除艦载機外，更混以P51型共約千架，並出動B29大型機六百架，實施空母航空兵力與基地航空兵力之完全協同作戰。當此三頭會談開始之際，敵方業已開始其千架轟炸日本土計劃，顯然更含有政治宜傳之意。預料此後敵方將展開全面之戰術的航空作戰，此點殊有警戒之必要。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　二十四日上午六時，敵機B29　P51型約二百聚，及艦載機百七十架，分成小編隊來表內海方面及吳地區，主要以機鎗掃射航空基地及航行巾之小機船舶。九時三十分敵艦載機第二波形編隊，以戰鬥轟炸機聯合約二百架，侵入吳地區，主要攻擊港內之船舶，迄下午一時查明之戰果，日軍對空砲火，擊落擊毀敵機三十架。</p>
<h3>殘酷舉動</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　最近B29型及小型敵機，攻擊中小都布，死傷者相當多數，尤以婦女幼童罹災者更衆，此態殊値重視。原因一部份以民間防空陣不　危險活動努力所致，惟另一方面亦因敵撥攻擊目標專以殺傷人命爲快。茲舉數例證明之，　甲府市遭敵機攻擊陸，敵機先對山　附近週難地區投擲燒火彈，實施濫炸，使市民無法逃　，再海向市內轟炸。　敵機襲淸水市，亦採取同樣手段，以火焰封鎖山地與海岸後，再殘殺市民。　在平塚市敵機發現難民遵於附近松林時，即加投彈。</p>
<h3>日鐵道義勇隊　改編戰隊</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據日陸軍省發表：業於七月二十三日發表命令，將鐵道義勇隊改編爲鐵道戰鬥隊。</p>
<h3>歐洲美空軍　調往太平洋</h3>
<p>典京城二十三日中央社電　據倫敎電，美軍歐洲空翰部隊於二十二日發表：歐洲美軍轟炸機及戰鬥機百分之八，已調往太平洋戰綫，</p>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電　據　烏電：美國第八航空隊司令官杜立德，業於二十三日到達太平洋航空大基地。</p>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電　據馬尼刺電：自機國方面移調非島之首批美軍五千餘名，業於日昨到達馬尼刺，其中泰半爲工兵部隊。</p>
<h3>菲到日軍各部隊建樹偉勳　日陸軍省前日發表</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日陸軍省於七月二十三日發表稱：菲烏日軍各部隊自本年一月九日以後，曾於菲島各戰現建樹偉勳，　由菲島方面日陸軍最高指揮官授以感狀，此次復上聞日皇陛下。茲將該各部隊及其功動列後</p>
<p>「庄司部隊及其管轄部隊」該部隊於庄司大尉指揮下，自一月九日敵軍於仁牙因灣登陸以來，屢次攻擊海岸敵軍加以重創，复連夜奇襲敵軍登陸根據地，殲敵極衆，且炸毀共軍需品甚多，又復將優勢之敵軍，誘至日軍陣前加以猛擊，使其潰退，其後敵軍雖增强兵力，欲偸襲日軍後方陣地，然見該部隊因戒備森嚴而引退。一月未全隊又壯烈肉搏進攻，並展開頑强之週擊戰予以重創後，歸還原防。</p>
<p>「澤田部隊及附屬部隊」該隊會於陸軍大尉澤　宙雄指揮下，迎整於仁牙因灣登陸之敵軍，發揮日單優秀戰術重創敵軍。自一月十日以來，敵單以熾烈砲火圍攻該地據守之高地時，該隊將士相　傷亡，彈藥亦吿不足，然該部隊仍不庸奮戰，最後全軍僅餘中隊長等五名，但仍確守該高地一帶，阻撓敵軍前進。</p>
<p>「佐藤工兵隊」該部隊於陸軍大尉佐藤眞一統率下，自一月九日以來·果敢奇襲敵登陸軍，自一月十六日迄二十日之間，屬次猛襲敵根據地，炸毀敵軍重要武器，及坦克東目動砲彈藥貯藏所等甚多，並覆減其根據地，收獲莫大戰果。繼之，自一月二十日以後，復以少數兵力突人敵陣，以火熖放射　地雷等殲敵數百名，同時並迅速理置地電，阻害敵戰車之行動，厥功共偉</p>
<p>「藤重部隊及其配屬都隊」該部隊於陸軍大佐藤重正指揮下，自一月二十日以來重創敵登陸軍，更對敵軍之空挺部隊以機宜之行動，將其擊減，同時並以少數兵力奉制强敵，阻撓其向馬尼刺前進，其後該隊雖屢遭敵軍包圍猛攻，然仍英勇奮戰，予敵傷害極重。</p>
<p>「長谷川突攻隊」　隊於陸軍中尉長谷川晴光指陣下，於二月六日突破敵方之嚴重戒戒綫，擾亂敵交通路炸毀敵營，復於哪途襲擊敵糧秣貯存所，並截斷敵之通信綱，炸毀汽車多輛予以重創。</p>
<p>「西村部隊」該部隊於陸單大尉西村勇指揮下，於一月十六日全軍奇襲敵軍登陸根據地，將其覆減。一月三十一日以後，因日美兩軍衆寡懸殊，致部隊長以下將兵相繼陣亡，惟生存之將兵仍長期死守該四六三高地。</p>
<p>「倉齊砲兵分隊」該部隊於陸軍曹長倉齊指揮下重創强敵，其後因敵砲火熾烈，致日軍傷亡　接，然分隊長以下各兵士士氣　振，殲減敵軍數百，並炸毀大砲戰車及其他軍需品甚多。灣之，一月十九日復前進，對敵展開反一攻，以殘餘之大砲一鬥，　敵集中砲火勇敢奮戰，終至彈藥罄盡，而全隊壯</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>學校應準備疏散</h3>
<p>關於學校疏散問題，我們會數四論及，且早在數月前，即已指出學校疏散的必要性。可是，迄今未見學校當局與敎育常局有所計議，有所準備。也許關係各方面以爲實行疏散，困難重重，諸如疏散目的地之選擇，校舍之租借與佈置，敎職人員之安頓，學生之隨校寄讀，校具儀器之遷移與運輸工具之取得等等問題，都是立即發生而同時需要解決的。因有此種種實際問題，或許擊校當局雖有疏散之意，而無實行的决心。</p>
<p>諴然，學校實行疏散，確有種種問題，確是相當困難。可是，我們必須認淸，爲什麼要疏散？母庸諱言的，這是環境促使我們要實行疏散。學校爲了繼續擔負敎育的責任，爲了克盡急速造就參加復興建設人才的重大使命，無論如何不能使敎育事業中輟，在這個神聖的使命與任務之下，任何困難，任何艱阻，必須以決心與勇氣去排除去例决。况且，目前學校實行疏散所引爲問題的，幷不十分困難。我們認爲敎育與學校當局，只須不以苟安心理先入爲主，而振起非疏散不可的次心與勇氣，那末，縱是一切困難問題，都可以迎刃而解的。我們願進而申說如次：</p>
<p>疏散目的地問題，主要條件只須非軍事要衝，而當地民風淳厚生活程度較低的城鄉，即爲適當。洽安問題，則在共次，因爲學校幷非生產生利機關。如洞庭山角直等地，均無不可。</p>
<p>校舍之租借與佈置問題，上述諸地據各方面實地調查，均有適當空屋，如廟宇祠堂等等均可改用，祇須不浸雨，能避風，丙陋就簡，何傷大雅，精神克服物質，在教讀生活中要應充分發揚。</p>
<p>職人員之安頓問題，更易解決。目前生活費用中最大者厥爲膳食，學校敎職人員之家庭生活負擔，也莫不感覺膳食一項最受威脅。如學校疏散至鄉村，則膳食費用必較上海爲廉，就家庭生活負擔之解决而言，更就安全問題而言，深信敎職人員誰不願意隨校疏散？</p>
<p>學生是否隨校寄讀問題，據一般推論，學生家長决不願使子弟輟學，同時必爲子弟之安全擔心，如學校疏故至安全地區，則家長之願送子弟隨校寄讀，必無疑問。</p>
<p>校具儀器之遷移及運輸工具問題。校具儀器自需擇要遷移，運輸工具，我們相信疏散委員會必能負責協助，必能使學校當局得到滿意。</p>
<p>我們認爲學校實行疏散，學校當局所引爲困難問題者，均可獲得相當解決，而所成問題者，却在學校當局本身之有無決心與男氣而已。然而，本市之連日遭受敵機盲炸，已是有目共覩之事實，而今後愈繫愈烈，更在意料之中，決不能存苟安僥倖心理而自討苦吃，個人之不必要居留上海者及慈善團體，同應從速疏散，而學校尤其是大學專科學校及現模校大的中學，也應從速準有疏散。</p>
<p>在此非常時常，應有非常的決心與勇氣，排除萬難，創造新的環境，我們以此期望於敎育及學校當局·總之，下學期應準備如何疏散，而不應準備如何開學，願注意及之。</p>
<h3>日殊勳戰士　榮賞詞</h3>
<p>福岡二十四日中央社電　日軍某部對由去年六月十六日迄本月十日一年餘之間，曾邀擊中國大陸馬里亞納及敵機動部隊之美空軍，獲舉擊落及擊毀敵機約二百架之戰果。又本年五月七日馬里亞納基地之敵機B29型來襲日本土時，日軍屠龍航空隊之靑木實及金子良一兩軍曹，會於豐後水道天空，突人敵機十一架之一編隊，各擊毀敵機一架，不幸中彈自炸，廿二日由軍司令官對於上述之殊動戰士傳達當詞。</p>
<h3>美機二百架襲舟山島</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　敵機B25型　B24型約百架，P38型掩護戰鬥機約百架，二十三日白畫來襲舟山島，日軍當即邀擊，擊落六架擊破四架。</p>
<h3>喜丹河西岸　日軍施反攻　緬甸戰事轉呈緊張</h3>
<p>緬甸基地二十四日中央社電　日軍於喜丹河西岸開始反攻以來，迄已二句，卡勞羅伊姆方面與東瓜東方全戰綫突呈緊張，庇古附近之英軍敗退後，使市民愈形議示不信任英軍態度，故敵方連日宣傅稱，強力之增援軍業已到達。並宣傳防禦完備，無庸顧慮，以防止民心動搖，其情狀　極狼狽云。</p>

<h3>奉賢之行</h3>
<p>奉賢幅員　闊，平原一片，站之東南，連接捍海土塘，西北與南滙中江及松江接壤，縣府幾經遷徙，民元年仍移南橋鎭。該願交通四達，商業較盛，機關林立，爲奉賢之政治與商業之重心。全境劃分五區，五鎭，四十三鄉，各區共轄五六○○四戶，約二十三萬九千餘人。</p>
<p>人民大都以務農耕織爲生，經商爲副，民風數本重學。讀畫好古，以明末幾社爲盛，今雖少衰，而特立之土，時復間出。</p>
<h3>沿途情形</h3>
<p>由市區往南機，路徑有二，一爲外灘之十三號碼頭，搭金山班輪船，經黃浦江西行抵閔行，渡江再乘長途汽東直達南橋鎭；一爲搭斜土路之民營汽車，輕滬閔路抵閔行，復渡江乘汽車經閔南路至鎭口。前者輪船沿途時常停載載各，需時四五小時方扺閔行，茲初夏炎日，更因船小人多，旅途頗難受。後者雖所　較貴，惟終其全程僅在二小時以內。故記者捨此而</p>
<p>晨九時，汽車由斜土路開行，約一小時許抵閔行鎭。車經滬閔路，備受顚簸，路面以顓　鎭前後段最劣，每隔十數尺，必有一潭，車輪過此，下　三四寸，車行其間，如舟行波濤淘湧之洪流中。沿途自由車單帮—米販，絡繹不絕，據云彼等之目的地爲南橋附近之各村鎭。</p>
<p>由閔行渡江，每客五百，自由　三百，如車上有米另議。上岸搭汽車扺南橋鎭，因公路平坦，費時僅十五分鐘。</p>
<h3>戒備嚴密</h3>
<p>自淸鄉以還，治安逐漸恢復，惟縣境廣大，鄉區治安維臻　意，如拓抹諸區，　付未靖，混跡思逞，尤以演海地域，常爲不良份子出沒巢穴，雖經地方駐軍一再掃蕩，東竄西突。餘　未淸，近復變木加厲，嘯緊日衆，每東夜問，持械侵入民家，肆　物資，地方安寧，受極大之威脅。</p>
<p>各民鎭現有　察與駐防當地之保安隊，共負維持治安之責，同時尙有日軍憲機關，隨時與之連格，鼎力防禦，當記者抵鎭後，二小時內即受當地便衣偵探之增問，由此刻見其　備嚴密之一斑。</p>
<p>爲補助重武力所不　，特自各鄉區集合壯丁，組織自警團，互作運繫，守望相助，並於農隙之際，加以軍事訓練，編成保安預備隊，以備有警時協助重警，保護梓里</p>
<h3>商市金</h3>
<p>在　之商市，以南機之南北大街中市爲盛，舊治奉城，小而荒寂，已無規模可觀之商店。南橋鎭上，自早至暮，商販不絕，來自各村鎭之男女農民，以物資銷售，換取日用品而返。一般商店，其負擔基重，故其售價，較上海尤爲昂貴。即以飯館論，普通一人吃一菜一湯，支出之數近二萬元。</p>
<p>該縣金融機關，計有浦左農業銀行及祥和錢莊等數家，近來票據貼現費率甚大，發行撥款單流弊滋多，據云鎭上某錢莊，未領部照，　先開業，近更濫發不兌現之本票，侵越國家通貨發行權，超過資金數十倍，致市面混亂，人心不安，際此戰爭激烈階段，當局爲安定民生，應遵財部法令，隨時注意，從嚴取締。</p>
<h3>米棉雜糧</h3>
<p>縣可耕之田，經田賦處調查，爲五十八萬五千八百畝，其中約二十萬畝爲水田，多在西鄉，餘爲旱田，多在東鄉。水田宜種稻，惟地氣較早，必於淸明浸種，　雨插秋，故有百日稻，六十日稻諸名，今更有五十日稻者。西鄉地　，　水差易，所獲當豐，近來鄉區因治安關係，產量遠不如前，每年食糧當仰給于鄰邑，松金等縣之接濟，茲雖種稻之戶增多，然猶未達自給自足地步。</p>
<p>歷年催政田賦，約在九成以上，稍此於　　申江。自本六月一日　，改征寶物，第一期三成。農作物方面，向以植棉爲主，事變前，棉花年產二十餘萬担，爲出口之大宗，每年銷路達數百萬，近年來棉價不及米價，一般農戶大都改棉爲稻，致昔日盛况，已成歷史陳跡。</p>

<h3>本佛教慈悲之旨　爲空災同胞服務　市佛教會勸告教徒</h3>
<p>本市佛教會近爲救濟空襲災民，發表告全市諸山長老及諸大居士書，略謂：「佛敎最重要的教訓，便是慈悲，慈在給與人類以快樂，悲是拔除人類的苦痛。敎主所遺的訓言的價値，是在徒衆能够實踐本行，倘我們不能實踐這遺訓，自己個人方面，就失却佛敎徒的資格，同時汚辱了敎主的金言，使整個佛教黯然失色。諸山長老，各位善信男女，大家部已知道比時比地是輸到我們一個試騐的樹會，試騐佛敎是否於人世有利益沒有？敎主的遺訓及平日佛敎徒口頭上所說的好諸是不是兌現的支票？佛教徒是否純是自私，冷酷，沒同情心？一切的一切，現在是給我們一個最大的試金石！尤其已臨在這萬苦前逼的刦難當頭，我們須要挺起脊梁，照着敎主遺訓去實踐，做出事實來給人家看。我們同是踏在上海的地上，整個上海的危險已到來了，五百萬人的生命財產，都有人息不保出息，舉足難保下足的危機，照最近兩三次的空襲，已深切地警吿我們了，炸彈是沒有眼睛的，觸地即發，一排排的房子轟的被轟，倒的被倒了，人也隨著死的死，傷的傷，待而活著也無家可歸，無以爲生，却成了無告之民了。我們旣是佛敎徒，今日幸而未死，財產幸未被毀，然身財無當，是實地體味得到了，應本佛敎慈悲之宗旨，爲已遭苦難同胞來服務。我們現在先成立災民臨時收容所，就上海現行市區即聯合若千僧寺爲被難同胞臨時寄宿處，所指定該寺之住持，即爲該所之主任，本會當盡其最大之努力，主持一切，爲被難同胞盡其應盡之責任。希望上海諸山長老與佛教善信男女，共同立再教主慈悲爲旨的　職之下，有力者出力，有錢者出錢，行大慈悲，於這生死險迫中作無畏使者，將我們教主所說之法寶，做個十足兌現的支票！」</p>

<h3>Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Breaks Out Near Samarinda Road; Enemy Continues to Reinforce Northwest of Balikpapan</h3>
<p>Pacific Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces in the Balikpapan area have received reinforcements. On the 21st, they bombarded Japanese front-line positions with mortars and field guns. Approximately one enemy company in several detachments attacked, but the Japanese forces repelled them all. On the 22nd, the enemy continued its offensive, and fierce fighting is currently underway between both sides. The Japanese forces inflicted approximately 330 casualties on the enemy on the 21st and 22nd.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – On the Balikpapan front, a temporary stalemate had previously existed. However, since the 20th, fierce fighting between Japanese and American forces has resumed near the Samarinda Road. Japanese garrison units engaged in hand-to-hand combat against enemy defects, launching strong assaults on enemy positions, causing them great damage. On the 22nd, a portion of the enemy forces began landing reinforcements using five small boats near Tambaton, 21 kilometers northwest of Balikpapan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Inflict Heavy Damage on Enemy in Surprise Attack</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – The enemy is attempting to recapture the oil field area of Balikpapan, but is being held back by the Japanese deep defense positions along the Samarinda Road and cannot advance. Recently, the enemy has been clearing the dense forests on both sides of the road, attempting to press closer to Japanese positions. Currently, the battle lines of the two armies facing each other eight kilometers from Samarinda are only 50 to 15 meters apart. Taking advantage of this, from the 10th to the 20th, the Japanese forces dispatched suicide squads to charge into enemy positions, annihilating over 200 enemy soldiers and depleting their combat strength. For example, Japanese soldiers Okamoto and two others, during the battle of Mount Kasayama, carried landmines and charged into an enemy formation only 40 meters away, ultimately destroying two enemy tanks. Furthermore, Japanese Lance Corporal Hayashi destroyed an enemy heavy tank with a landmine. Additionally, three Japanese sentries attacked an enemy group with explosive charges, killing and wounding 50 enemy soldiers in one fell swoop. The Kamai Unit carried out a hand-to-hand combat assault against an enemy company north of the water source defense area. Ten brave warriors, including Sergeant First Class Nakamura Asaichi, infiltrated the enemy's rear, killing 15 enemy soldiers and capturing the enemy's position. In addition, the Kamai Unit opened fire on the Sembalia oilfield hills, annihilating an accompanying enemy company. Furthermore, a commando unit led by Captain Komine skillfully and rapidly attacked an enemy position and destroyed seven enemy artillery vehicles, displaying courageous and daring combat, causing extreme terror to the enemy.</p>
<h3>Enemy Naval Forces Agitated in Southern Waters; Enemy Movement Observed; 30 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down/Destroyed in Attack on Kure Port</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's mobile forces intruded into Japanese coastal waters on the 10th of this month, primarily using carrier-based aircraft to bomb various areas from Kanto northward to Hokkaido. Subsequently, the mobile forces bombed various areas of Japan, while still patrolling the waters near the mainland, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Currently, they are gradually moving towards the sea south of the Japanese mainland. On the 24th, activity began west of the Tokai region. On the 24th, the enemy's operations were not limited to carrier-based aircraft. The enemy's small aircraft, in addition to carrier-based aircraft, also included approximately 1,000 P-51s, and 600 B-29 heavy bombers were deployed, implementing fully coordinated operations between carrier air power and land-based air power. At the start of this Three-Headed Conference, the enemy had already begun its plan to bomb the Japanese mainland with 1,000 aircraft, clearly containing a political propaganda intention. It is anticipated that the enemy will launch a full-scale tactical air operation thereafter, and this point requires careful vigilance.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – At 6:00 AM on the 24th, approximately 200 enemy B-29 and P-51 aircraft, and 170 carrier-based aircraft, in small formations, attacked the Inland Sea area and the Kure region, primarily strafing air bases and small vessels sailing within the area with machine guns. At 9:30 AM, the second wave of enemy carrier-based aircraft, in a combined formation of approximately 200 fighter-bombers, intruded into the Kure region, primarily attacking ships within the port. As of 1:00 PM, the results confirmed that Japanese anti-aircraft fire shot down and destroyed 30 enemy aircraft.</p>
<h3>Cruel Actions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Recently, B-29s and small enemy aircraft have attacked small and medium-sized cities, resulting in a significant number of deaths and injuries, especially among women and children. This situation is noteworthy. This is partly due to insufficient effort in civil air defense, but on the other hand, it is also because the enemy specifically targets civilians to inflict casualties as quickly as possible. Here are a few examples to prove this: When Kofu City was attacked by enemy aircraft, the enemy first dropped incendiary bombs on the mountains near the surrounding difficult areas, carrying out indiscriminate bombing, making it impossible for citizens to escape, and then bombed the city again. When enemy aircraft attacked Shimizu City, they also adopted the same tactic, using flames to block the mountains and coastline before massacring civilians. In Hiratsuka City, enemy aircraft dropped bombs when they discovered refugees gathered in a nearby pine forest.</p>
<h3>Japanese Railway Volunteer Corps Reorganized into Combat Unit</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a statement by the Japanese Ministry of the Army, an order was issued on July 23rd to reorganize the Railway Volunteer Corps into the Railway Combat Unit.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air Force in Europe Transferred to Pacific</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a report from London, the U.S. Army Air Forces in Europe announced on the 22nd that eight percent of the U.S. Army's bombers and fighters in Europe had been transferred to the Pacific Theater.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Uruguay, General Doolittle, commander of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, arrived at a large Pacific air base on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Manila, the first group of over 5,000 U.S. troops transferred from the United States to the island arrived in Manila yesterday, most of whom were engineer units.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Units in Philippines Achieve Great Merits; Japanese Ministry of the Army Announced the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on July 23rd that since January 9th of this year, various Japanese units in the Philippines have achieved great merits in the various battles in the Philippines. They were awarded commendations by the highest Japanese army commander in the Philippines, which were subsequently reported to His Majesty the Emperor. The various units and their accomplishments are listed below:</p>
<p>"Shoji Unit and its Subordinate Units" Under the command of Captain Shoji, since the enemy landed in Lingayen Gulf on January 9th, the unit has repeatedly attacked enemy coastal forces, inflicting heavy damage. It also launched surprise attacks on the enemy's landing base at night, annihilating a large number of enemy soldiers and destroying a large amount of enemy supplies. Furthermore, the unit lured superior enemy forces to the front of Japanese positions and launched a fierce attack, causing them to collapse. Afterwards, although the enemy strengthened their forces, they wanted to sneak attack the Japanese rear positions, but they retreated upon seeing that the unit was heavily guarded. At the end of January, the entire unit launched a heroic hand-to-hand attack, and展开頑强之週擊戰予以重创后,归还原防.</p>
<p>"Sawada Unit and Attached Units" Under the command of Army Captain Sawada Hiroo, the unit met the enemy forces landing in Lingayen Gulf and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy using superior Japanese tactics. Since January 10th, when the enemy besieged the heights held by the unit with fierce artillery fire, the officers and soldiers of the unit suffered casualties and ammunition ran out, but the unit still fought bravely. In the end, only five members of the entire army remained, including the company commander, but they still secured the heights, preventing the enemy from advancing.</p>
<p>"Sato Engineer Corps" Under the command of Army Captain Sato Shinichi, the unit bravely launched surprise attacks on the enemy landing forces since January 9th. From January 16th to the 20th, the unit repeatedly attacked the enemy base, destroying many important enemy weapons, tank ammunition depots, etc., and reducing their base, achieving great results. Subsequently, since January 20th, the unit has penetrated the enemy's positions with a small number of soldiers, killing hundreds of enemy soldiers with flamethrowers and landmines. At the same time, the unit quickly deployed landmines to hinder enemy tank movements, making great contributions.</p>
<p>"Fujishige Unit and Assigned Units" Under the command of Army Captain Sato Shigemasa, the unit inflicted heavy damage on the enemy landing forces since January 20th. With flexible actions, the unit擊減了敵軍之空挺部隊, at the same time, the unit contained the enemy with a small number of soldiers, hindering its advance towards Manila. Although the team was repeatedly besieged and attacked by enemy forces, it still fought bravely, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.</p>
<p>"Hasegawa Assault Team" Under the command of Army Lieutenant Hasegawa Harumitsu, on February 6th, the team broke through the enemy's heavy cordon, disrupting enemy transportation routes and destroying enemy camps. On the way, the unit attacked the enemy's food storage and cut off the enemy's communication network, and destroyed many vehicles, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>"Nishimura Unit" Under the command of Army Captain Nishimura Isamu, on January 16th, the entire army launched a surprise attack on the enemy landing base, and annihilated it. Since January 31st, due to the great disparity between the Japanese and American forces, the commanders and soldiers below the unit commander were successively killed in battle. However, the surviving soldiers continued to defend Hill 463 for a long time.</p>
<p>"Kurasai Artillery Platoon" Under the command of Army Sergeant Kurasai, the unit inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Subsequently, due to the fierce enemy artillery fire, the Japanese army suffered casualties, but the morale of the soldiers below the platoon commander was high, and they annihilated hundreds of enemy troops, and destroyed artillery tanks and other military supplies. In湾之，一月十九日復前進，對敵展開反一攻，以殘餘之大砲一鬥，　敵集中砲火勇敢奮戰，終至彈藥罄盡，而全隊壯</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Schools Should Prepare for Evacuation</h3>
<p>We have discussed the issue of school evacuation several times, and as early as a few months ago, we pointed out the necessity of school evacuation. However, to date, we have not seen any discussion or preparation by the school authorities and the Education Bureau. Perhaps all parties concerned believe that implementing evacuation presents numerous difficulties, such as the selection of evacuation destinations, the rental and arrangement of school buildings, the settlement of teaching staff, students' attendance at schools, the relocation of school equipment and instruments, and the acquisition of transportation, all of which are problems that arise immediately and need to be solved simultaneously. Because of these practical problems, perhaps the school authorities, although they have the intention to evacuate, do not have the determination to implement it.</p>
<p>Indeed, implementing school evacuation does have various problems and is quite difficult. However, we must recognize why we need to evacuate. It is undeniable that the environment is prompting us to implement evacuation. In order to continue to bear the responsibility of education, and to do its utmost to rapidly cultivate talent to participate in the reconstruction, we must not allow the education to be interrupted. Under this sacred mission and task, any difficulties and any obstacles must be eliminated with determination and courage. Moreover, the problems that school evacuation currently raises are not very difficult. We believe that the education and school authorities only need to not let a complacent mentality take precedence, but to rise up with the courage that evacuation is essential. Then, even if there are any difficult problems, they can be solved easily. We would like to further elaborate as follows:</p>
<p>The main conditions for the issue of evacuation destinations are that they must not be key military locations, and the cities and towns where the local customs are simple and the standard of living is relatively low are appropriate. Security is secondary, because schools are not production or profit-making agencies. Places such as Dongting Mountain Jiaozhi are all possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of renting and arranging school buildings, according to on-the-spot investigations by various parties, there are appropriate vacant houses in the above-mentioned places, such as temples and ancestral halls, which can be converted. As long as they are not soaked by rain and can avoid wind, simplicity will be greatly appreciated, and the spirit of overcoming matter should be fully promoted in the teaching and reading life.</p>
<p>The issue of settling teaching staff is easier to solve. The biggest expense in current living expenses is meals, and the family living burden of school teaching staff also feels most threatened by the meal expense. If schools evacuate to the countryside, meal expenses will inevitably be cheaper than in Shanghai. In terms of solving the family living burden and in terms of safety, I believe that no teaching staff would be unwilling to evacuate with the school.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of whether students should attend schools, according to general speculation, parents will never want their children to drop out of school, and at the same time, they will worry about the safety of their children. If schools evacuate to safe areas, there is no doubt that parents will be willing to send their children to schools.</p>
<p>The issue of relocating school equipment and instruments and transportation. School equipment and instruments need to be relocated selectively, and we believe that the evacuation committee will be responsible for assisting and will be able to satisfy the school authorities.</p>
<p>We believe that the difficulties that school authorities raise about school evacuation can all be solved to a considerable extent, and the problem lies in the school authorities' own determination and boldness. However, the fact that this city has been subjected to enemy blind bombing for consecutive days is obvious, and it is expected that it will become more and more intense in the future. We must not have a complacent mentality and ask for trouble ourselves. Individuals who do not need to stay in Shanghai and charitable organizations should evacuate as soon as possible, and schools, especially universities, colleges, and large secondary schools, should also be prepared to evacuate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In this extraordinary period, there should be extraordinary determination and courage to overcome all difficulties and create a new environment. We expect this from education and school authorities. In short, the next semester should prepare for how to evacuate, not how to start school. We hope you pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Service Soldiers – Honorable Commendation</h3>
<p>Fukuoka, 24th (Central News Agency) – A Japanese military unit, over a year from June 16th of last year to the 10th of this month, invited and attacked the U.S. Air Force from the Mariana Islands and enemy mobile units on the Chinese mainland, achieving the result of shooting down and destroying approximately 200 enemy aircraft. On May 7th of this year, when enemy B29 aircraft from the Mariana base attacked the Japanese mainland, Aoki Minoru and Kaneko Ryoichi, two sergeants of the Japanese Dragon Slayer Air Corps,突人敵機十一架之一編隊, each destroyed one enemy aircraft over the Bungo Channel. Unfortunately, they were hit and self-destructed. On the 22nd, the military commander conveyed the above-mentioned special service soldiers to them.</p>
<h3>200 U.S. Aircraft Attack Zhoushan Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Approximately 100 enemy B-25 and B-24 aircraft, and approximately 100 P-38 escort fighters, attacked Zhoushan Island in broad daylight on the 23rd. The Japanese army immediately invited them to attack, shooting down six and destroying four.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Launch Counterattack on West Bank of Xi Tang River; Burmese War Turns Tense</h3>
<p>Burma Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army launched a counterattack on the west bank of the Xi Tang River, which has lasted for two sentences, the entire front line from Kalaw Lawi Um to the east of Donggua has suddenly become tense. After the retreat of the British army near Bigu, the citizens have shown a growing lack of trust in the British army. Therefore, the enemy has been publicizing daily that powerful reinforcements have arrived. It also publicized that the defense is complete and there is no need to worry, in order to prevent civil unrest. The situation is extremely embarrassing.</p>
<p>Travel Communication</p>
<h3>Trip to Fengxian</h3>
<p>Fengxian has a vast area, and the plains are endless. To the southeast of the station, it is connected to the seawall, and to the northwest and south, it is adjacent to Nanhui Zhongjiang and Songjiang. The county government has been moved several times, and in the first year of the Republic, it was moved to Nanqiao Town. The county has well-developed transportation and relatively prosperous commerce, with many agencies, making it the political and commercial center of Fengxian. The entire territory is divided into five districts, five towns, and forty-three townships. Each district has a total of 56,004 households, with approximately 239,000 people.</p>
<p>Most of the people make a living by farming and weaving, supplemented by commerce. The folk customs value learning and honor the past. The Jishe in the late Ming Dynasty was at its peak. Although it has declined somewhat today, independent scholars still occasionally emerge.</p>
<h3>Situation Along the Way</h3>
<p>There are two routes from the urban area to Nanqiao: one is Pier 13 on the Bund, taking the Jinshan liner, going west along the Huangpu River to Minhang, crossing the river and then taking a long-distance bus directly to Nanqiao Town; the other is to take a private car on Xietu Road, passing the Shanghai-Min Road to Minhang, then crossing the river and taking a bus via Minnan Road to the entrance of the town. The former liner often stops to load and unload goods along the way, taking four or five hours to reach Minhang. In the early summer heat, it is even more difficult to travel due to the small boat and large number of people. The latter is more expensive, but the entire journey takes only within two hours. Therefore, the reporter舍此而</p>
<p>At nine in the morning, the car departed from Xietu Road and reached Minhang Town in about an hour. The car passes through the Shanghai-Min Road, which is very bumpy. The road surface is worst in front and behind Zhuanqiao Town. Every ten feet, there must be a pool. When the wheels pass through this, they sink three or four inches. The car travels in between, like a boat sailing in the torrent of turbulent waves. There is an endless stream of cyclists and rice sellers along the way. It is said that their destinations are various villages and towns near Nanqiao.</p>
<p>Crossing the river from Minhang costs 500 per passenger and 300 for self-service, and the price is negotiable if there is rice on the car. It takes only 15 minutes to take a bus to Nanqiao Town because the highway is flat.</p>
<h3>Strict Security</h3>
<p>Since the Qingxiang, public security has gradually recovered, but the county is vast, and public security in rural areas has not reached the standard of satisfactory. In areas such as Tuomo,　付未靖, they hide to plot, especially in the coastal area, which is often a haunt for criminals. Although the local garrison has repeatedly swept it away, the east窜西突. 余　未淸, 近復變木加厲，嘯緊日衆，每東夜問，持械侵入民家，肆　物資，地方安寧，受極大之威脅.</p>
<p>The towns currently have policemen and security teams stationed locally, sharing the responsibility of maintaining public security. At the same time, there are Japanese military police organs that coordinate with them at any time and do their best to defend. When the reporter arrived in town, they were增問 by plainclothes detectives in two hours, from which刻见其　备严密的一斑。</p>
<p>In order to supplement what cannot be accomplished by heavy armament, strong men are assembled from all townships to organize self-defense groups, operate in coordination with each other, and watch out for each other. During the slack season, they undergo military training to form security reserve teams to assist the police in protecting their hometowns in case of an alarm.</p>
<h3>Market Scene</h3>
<p>The markets in the town are most prosperous in the North-South Avenue and Zhongshi in Nanqiao. Old Zhi Fengcheng is small and desolate, and there are no shops of any scale to see. In Nanqiao Town, from morning to evening, merchants never cease. Farmers from villages and towns come to sell materials, exchange for daily necessities and return. The burdens of general stores are heavy, so their prices are more expensive than in Shanghai. Even if you take a restaurant, the expenditure of one person eating one dish and one soup is nearly 20,000.</p>
<p>The county's financial institutions include the Puzuo Agricultural Bank and Xianghe Money House. Recently, the discount rate for bills has been very high, and the issuance of appropriation orders has caused many abuses. It is said that a certain money house in the town started operating without obtaining a license, and recently滥发不兑现之本票, encroaching on the national currency issuance right, exceeding the capital by dozens of times, causing chaos in the market and anxiety among the people. At this stage of intense warfare, in order to stabilize people's livelihood, the authorities should follow the laws and regulations of the Ministry of Finance, pay attention at any time, and strictly crack down on it.</p>
<h3>Rice Cotton and Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>According to a survey by the Tianfu Office, the county has 585,800 mu of arable land, of which approximately 200,000 mu are paddy fields, mostly in the western township, and the rest are dry land, mostly in the eastern township. Paddy fields are suitable for planting rice, but the climate is earlier, so seeds must be soaked during Qingming,　雨插秋, so there are hundreds of days of rice, sixty days of rice and other names, and now there are fifty days of rice. The western countryside　水差易, and the harvest is abundant. Recently, due to public security reasons in rural areas, the output is far less than before, and every year food depends on the supply of neighboring counties such as Songjin. Although the number of households planting rice has increased, it has not yet reached the point of self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>历年催政田赋，约在九成以上，稍此于　　申江. Since June 1,改征寶物，第一期三成。 In terms of crops, cotton has always been the main crop. Before the incident, the annual cotton output was more than 200,000 dan, which was a major export product, with annual sales reaching millions. In recent years, the price of cotton has been lower than the price of rice, and most farmers have changed cotton to rice, so the past盛况已成历史陈迹.</p>
<p>靑村产　, and the manufactured fishing nets are profitable for the fishermen. The coastal waters that do not reach the tide do not produce　卤, which was all abandoned in the past. Now, due to the soaring rice prices, miscellaneous grains驟　重要地位, farmers have begun to use wasteland to increase the planting of sweet potatoes, maize, and beans. Only the coastal sandy land is very vast,时　　　期内，未加　植，殊属可惜</p>
<h3>Education and Culture</h3>
<p>The organization of education and culture suffered immense damage during the invasion period. School buildings were destroyed, or school equipment was lost entirely. Although years have passed with various forms of assistance leading to a slight recovery, due to a lack of talent and funding, rural education remains backward, and out-of-school children are scattered across the countryside. Considering the current situation in the entire county, there is one junior middle school, twelve model primary schools and complete primary schools, and sixty-nine junior primary schools, with a total of only over seven thousand seven hundred students. In addition to subsidies from the local authorities, school operating expenses are also supplemented by an appropriate increase in rice for education. As for the salaries of teachers and staff, although they have been nominally increased tenfold according to living conditions, they still cannot keep up with the rapid rise in prices. Therefore, teachers' lives remain difficult.</p>
<p>To restore the former state of affairs, it is planned to add one central primary school in each district of the county as a model, and to prepare for the establishment of a normal school in a suitable central location to cultivate teachers, who will be assigned to serve in various schools, in order to popularize education.</p>
<h3>Social Welfare</h3>
<p>The cooperative was established in September of the thirty-first year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], with branches in Qingcun, Fengcheng, Zhuangxing, and other places. Since last year, the sources of daily consumer goods have decreased sharply, and rationing has stopped. The cooperative collects various items such as hemp seeds and horse grass to exchange for supplies such as matches and soap from the Shanghai Showa Trading Company for rationing purposes. Currently, the cooperative plans to establish a trust business to lend money to farmers.</p>
<p>After the incident [presumably referring to the outbreak of war], all charitable organizations were suspended. In the spring of the thirty-first year, the Relief and Aid Affairs Committee was established, reorganizing public property as a foundation to successively restore orphanages, educational funds, vocational training centers for vagrants, nursing homes, and baby nurseries. Recently, local enthusiastic philanthropists and merchants, such as Xie Kexiang, and the abbot of Eryan Temple, the Reverend Xin Fu, established a free clinic at the Ancient Buddha Pavilion on North Street in Nanqiao to benefit the poor and sick. The county hospital and clinic are also being gradually constructed, with the aim of improving social welfare day by day.</p>

<h3>Plague Spreads in Chongqing and Chengdu</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch - According to information from this city [Shanghai], the plague is rampant in Chongqing, with several deaths among citizens every day. According to reports from Chongqing, the plague began spreading from June 3 and quickly spread throughout the city. The Chongqing Xinmin Daily reported that citizens were terrified of the plague. By mid-June, the epidemic had further expanded, with an estimated dozens of deaths. However, the evening edition of the Ta Kung Pao on June 18 stated that on the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival, dozens of corpses were taken outside Linjiangmen, all because they could not afford coffins. The evening edition of the Xinmin Daily on June 26 also published a similar report, stating that the corpses were thrown into the river. The Xinmin Daily further claimed on the same day that the serious outbreak of cholera was due to the criminal activities of the Chongqing Kuomintang secret service, who forcefully cut off water and electricity, making it difficult to supply water. The general public had to drink unclean water, and some people even sold water on the streets, filling buckets with sewage from ditches. All of these factors were the main cause of the epidemic. However, Wang Zuxiang, Director of the Chongqing Health Bureau, claimed that it was acute gastroenteritis and not contagious. Only when the number of deaths increased did they begin injecting vaccines. At the same time, many medical institutions refused to inject citizens with vaccines, citing a shortage of vaccines. However, according to a medical professional, the vaccine reserves were abundant and there was no shortage. The recent shortage on the market was clearly due to someone hoarding them.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to Chongqing Radio, since the discovery of true cholera in Chengdu in June, as of July 21, a total of 257 deaths had been confirmed. The spread is intensifying day by day, and another type of cholera has been discovered, characterized by nausea without vomiting and diarrhea, and numbness in the limbs, but not fatal. On the 23rd, the authorities convened an expanded epidemic prevention meeting to promote epidemic prevention and discuss relief measures, deciding that the provincial infectious disease hospital and the municipal hospital should admit cholera patients free of charge, with all expenses subsidized by the provincial and municipal governments.</p>
<h3>Water and Land Transportation Restored Between Hangzhou and Wuxing, Security Along the Way Improving</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - The section of Zhejiang Province from Hangzhou to Wuxing (Huzhou) had its water and land transportation interrupted for a long time due to unrest. Recently, through the joint efforts of Governor Ding and the Pacification Director, and the assignment of stationed troops and security teams to actively suppress bandits, the bandits along the waterways and highways of Taihu Lake have been gradually eliminated, and all water and land transportation has been restored. In order to conduct a thorough investigation, Governor Ding, who also serves as the Pacification Director, specially dispatched Zhang, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Director's Office, and Zhang Juansheng, Director of Civil Affairs, to visit and inspect, accompanied by Watanabe, the liaison officer. They departed from Hangzhou and arrived in Wuxing via Deqing, and have already returned to Hangzhou. It is reported that water transportation between Hangzhou and Huzhou has indeed been fully restored, and many people along the way have returned to their hometowns, with the security situation improving daily. As for the highway, Governor Ding has instructed the responsible departments to rush to repair it, and it should be passable soon.</p>
<h3>Drought in the Northwest</h3>

According to the Chongqing Saodang Daily of the 23rd of this month, Gansu is the worst affected, with no rainfall in May and June. The disaster area accounts for four-fifths of the province, with about four million people affected. Grain prices are rising daily, with the price of flour increasing sevenfold in February. Shaanxi Province is also suffering from drought, with withered wheat crops. The disaster area includes sixty counties. Since Gansu had no rain before April, the general public was very worried about food and repeatedly requested relief from the authorities.</p>

<h3>Forest Fire in Oregon, USA</h3>

<h3>Details of Pétain's Trial in Paris Court, Old General Remains Calm</h3>
<p>Paris, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Paris yesterday: Former French Head of State, the old General Pétain, is being tried in the Paris Court on the dual charges of "harming the country and colluding with the enemy." He did not answer any questions and said sternly, "This court is not representative of the will of the entire French people, so I will not answer any questions." The former head of state wore a general's uniform with the Verdun Medal on his chest. He stood up solemnly and stated in a firm tone the reason for his silence: "The power we have is given by the entire French people, so I now make a statement to the French people. When General de Gaulle continued his efforts to fight, I was doing everything to make France free and liberated, keeping the wounded and divided France intact. If you convict me, it is tantamount to imposing a sentence on an innocent person. I entrust myself to the hands of the entire French people." At that time, the sound of whistles in the court was loud, and the trial had to be interrupted. Most defense lawyers believed that the court could not sentence Pétain, nor could it place Pétain under interrogation under Article 1875 of the Constitution. Judge Sicnart, who insisted on sentencing the former head of state to death, accused Pétain of no longer being able to use the terms set by the French Republic as a shield, because Pétain had trampled on the French Republic. Soon the trial resumed. Under heavy guard, Pétain returned to the court. Witness Rip also attended at the same time. The two met, and their eyes met as if they had met for the first time. The trial officially began eight minutes after Pétain entered. Pétain maintained his calm and silent attitude. He looked around at the questioning lawyer and asked, "How long will this trial last?" It was half past twelve in the afternoon, and many leaders of the French Republic (who were all present as witnesses) were late. When the clerk shouted "Defendant Pétain, stand up," Pétain trembled and stood up from his seat.</p>
<h3>Reading the Indictment</h3>
<p>The clerk then loudly read the prosecutor's indictment: "After Lebrun resigned on June 16, 1940, President Lebrun summoned Pétain to form a cabinet, because he was threatened by General Weygand, and some members of the cabinet wanted to follow Pétain. At the same time, considering that the war against Germany could not last, Pétain negotiated an armistice with Germany after forming a cabinet. Finally, the armistice agreement was signed on June 22, causing three-fifths of the French territory to fall into the hands of the Germans, and the entire French navy was placed under German management." The indictment also recorded how Pétain moved the capital to Vichy and maintained contact with Laval, and how the French upper and lower houses gave Pétain the power to enact a new constitution. However, Pétain used his power to exceed the power granted by the two houses, and also showed a conspiracy to destroy France, announcing three new constitutions. After the indictment was finished, Pétain said sternly, "The court is not representative of the will of the entire French people, so I will not answer any questions." He continued, "I led France to victory in the most tragic period of history, so the entire France tends to me. As for the request for an armistice, I really wanted to build a great cause to liberate France. I tried my best to protect the French people. For the sake of the entire French people, I would rather sacrifice my personal prestige. At the same time, my position forced me to issue various declarations. The revival of France is based on the foundation I laid. I have only the unity of France and the revival of France in my mind. I represent French culture, Christianity to seek forgiveness. If you sentence me, this kind of judgment will be the last judgment in the world. I entrust myself to the hands of the entire French people." The court was noisy again, and the defense lawyer accused the prosecutor of holding a prejudice. Finally, the prosecutor declared, "If there is clear evidence, Pétain can be sentenced to death." The order in the court gradually returned to normal, and the trial was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Soviet Arms Factories Need to Produce for Civilian Needs</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Moscow dispatch: After the restoration of peace in Europe, Soviet industry has begun to produce for civilian use. Not only are civilian factories changing from wartime production to peacetime production, but also military factories such as factories that manufacture aircraft, artillery shells, and automobiles are also changing to civilian use. For example, one of the largest factories manufacturing fighter jets has now stopped producing aircraft and is producing bicycles. The former ordnance factory produced 95,000 guns during the war and is now producing industrial supplies. The tank factory in the Urals produced 35,000 tanks during the war and is now producing train wheels. Another factory in the Urals, which produced equipment for iron refineries during the war and also produced tanks, is now a large-scale steel banner production factory. Many workers in civilian and military factories now work eight hours a day.</p>
<h3>Iran Announces Recognition of Polish Government</h3>

<h3>One Hundred Enemy Planes Attacked Shanghai Yesterday, Five Shot Down, Eleven Destroyed, Our Losses Minor</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 24th: From 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM today (the 24th), enemy fighter-bombers of the P24, B25, and P51 types, totaling approximately 100 aircraft, in several waves, invaded the Shanghai area, mainly bombing airfields around the city. The results were five shot down (one unconfirmed) and eleven destroyed. Our losses were minor.</p>
<h3>Civilian Houses in the Central District Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Also, it is reported that the city encountered another air raid at 10:00 AM yesterday, with about 100 enemy planes repeatedly bombing the outskirts of the city, but the bombs all fell on wasteland and open spaces, causing little damage. At around 11:00 AM, enemy planes again formed squadrons and attacked the city, bombing the residential areas of citizens in the central and southern districts. Several bombs hit civilian houses in Huangpu District, Yimiao District, and other places, destroying them. Personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters Rescue Department and other civil air defense personnel drove to the scene and, with the cooperation of the military authorities and the police stations and Baojia self-defense teams in each district, bravely rescued the victims. The wounded were sent to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment, and the corpses were transported by the Pushan Villa to designated locations to await identification. The details of the damage are still under investigation. At the bombed area in Huangpu District, police officers from the Laozha Police Station and the Baojia self-defense team helped with the rescue and maintained order. The air defense authorities expressed their great appreciation for their efforts. As for the victims whose houses were destroyed and who had no homes to return to, the Baojia authorities and relief organizations are taking measures to accommodate and provide relief.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Luo Inspects Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 24th) at around 10:00 AM, enemy planes again attacked various districts of the city in batches, and blindly dropped bombs in Huangpu District and Yimiao District, destroying many shops and houses in Huangpu District, killing and injuring dozens of people. In addition, more than a dozen shops along the street were shattered. Several houses were destroyed in Yimiao District, and several people were killed and injured. Upon receiving the report, Shanghai Special Municipal Government Secretary-General Luo led Deputy Director Man of the Police Bureau and others to inspect the above two places at 12:30 PM, inquired about the casualties, and supervised the rescue workers to bravely rescue the victims. He returned to the city government at around 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Citizens Pay Attention to Machine Gun Stray Bullets</h3>
<p>Also, when enemy planes bombed overhead, they also strafed with machine guns, and bullets flew everywhere. Generally, unemployed citizens often idly watch on the streets during air raids, or even go upstairs to watch, which is extremely dangerous. Stray bullets often affect people. Therefore, the air defense authorities strongly hope that citizens will pay close attention and absolutely not engage in the above-mentioned situations to avoid unexpected accidents. Also, when the civilian houses in the central and southern districts were bombed this time, fortunately, the citizens there had already taken appropriate shelter in appropriate places, so there were very few deaths and injuries. It is still hoped that citizens will also pay attention to air defense measures in the future to maintain safety.</p>
<h3>Air Raid Relief Committee Medical Group Held Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Bureau of Economic Affairs: Consolidation of Permit Issuing Offices</h3>
<p>Address also to be Changed</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, in view of the large number of permit issuing offices established in the past, the high cost of operations, and the difficulties in management, had long considered separating and consolidating them. Recently, with the completion of the 61st to 90th rounds of integrated rationing, personnel reductions were ordered in response to the call for streamlining, with the aim of reducing expenses and achieving practical results. The bureau has now decided to consolidate the original twenty-four offices into eight. Specifically, the original 1st, 2nd, and 3rd offices are combined into the 1st Issuing Office, located at 110 Jiangning Road; the 4th, 5th, and 6th are combined into the 2nd Issuing Office, located at 788 Zhabei Road; the 8th, 9th, 22nd, and 23rd are combined into the 3rd Issuing Office, located at 456 Wanan Road; the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 21st are combined into the 4th Issuing Office, located at 271 Changyang Road; the 13th, 14th, and 15th are combined into the 5th Issuing Office, located at 2 Nanhai Road; the 7th, 16th, and 20th are combined into the 6th Issuing Office, temporarily located at 2 Nanhai Road; and the 17th, 18th, and 19th are combined into the 7th Issuing Office, located on Nan Shi [district] Lailai Road. The 24th office is renamed the 8th Issuing Office, and its location remains at 260 Pudong Gaohang. All citizens are advised to note the changes of address of the various issuing offices. It is reported that approximately two hundred people, including those internally laid off due to the reorganization, will be affected by this adjustment.</p>
<h3>Four Silversmiths Fined for Tax Evasion</h3>
<p>Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Provisional Regulations on Special Consumption Taxes on Goods Sold Separately by the Ministry of Finance clearly stipulates that gold, silver, and their finished products should be subject to the luxury goods tax rate for special consumption tax collection. However, the silversmiths in this city have not been collecting the special tax on the old gold purchased at their stores when it is melted into gold bars and sold. Recently, the Bureau of Finance audited the account books of various silversmiths for a certain period and found that Biaotian Shili Ji Silversmith, Yang Qinghe Fa Ji Silversmith, Qiu Tian Dou De Ji Silversmith, and Lao Tian Dou Silversmith at 723 Taishan Road had not collected the special tax on the gold bars they sold. The amount of tax evaded ranged from 18.9 million yuan to 5.6 million yuan, a considerable sum. The Bureau of Finance has ordered the silversmiths to compensate for the full amount of the tax evaded and imposed penalties in accordance with the regulations. They have also been notified of a deadline for payment, or enforcement will be carried out.</p>
<h3>Shop Fined for Embezzling Special Tax</h3>
<p>The Kong Maria Shop, located at No. 405 within No. 370 North Suzhou Road in this city, opened in September of last year and closed down at the end of December due to poor business. However, the shop did not report the cessation of business to the Bureau of Finance until May of this year. After an investigation by the Bureau of Finance, it was discovered that the shop had embezzled the special tax collected during its operation and failed to pay it. In addition to ordering the shop to pay the outstanding tax, a fine of twenty times the amount of tax embezzled was imposed as a warning.</p>
<h3>Public Transportation Company Improves Ticket Sales</h3>
<p>In order to eliminate scalpers and facilitate ticket purchases for passengers, the China Railway authorities have strengthened management and established passenger information offices. As a result, the order at the stations has been improving daily. The East Asia Public Transportation Company in this city has also been strengthening its organization and management. In addition to the main office at the intersection of Nanjing and Sichuan Roads and the branch offices in Bazi Bridge and North Sichuan Road, which specialize in selling passenger and baggage tickets for the Central China region, a branch office has also been established on Binshan Road, specializing in selling tickets to military and government personnel and allied military and constitutional personnel in the city. It is also learned that the Bazi Bridge branch of the company, in order to alleviate the difficulty of ticket purchases for citizens in southern Shanghai, has organized a special self-defense corps under the guidance of the Taishan Police Sub-bureau to maintain order in the queue for ticket sales and to provide passengers with information on all travel-related matters. They will also provide answers. It is also reported that the branch has obtained the consent of the Municipal Postal Administration to set up a counter in the adjacent Bazi Bridge Post Office, specifically for selling tickets to North China, which will begin operations immediately. All baggage tickets for Central and North China are also available at the new location. It is understood that the branch aims to provide convenient services to passengers. If passengers have any complaints about the members or staff of the self-defense corps, they can confidentially report them, and the branch will gladly accept them. If an investigation reveals that their conduct is indeed improper, they will be dismissed immediately.</p>
<h3>Citywide Traffic Control Implemented Today</h3>
<h3>Military Police and Self-Defense Corps Deployed to Direct Traffic</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau will, from today (the 25th) to the 31st, fully implement the "Traffic Control Enhancement Week" in conjunction with military authorities such as the army, navy, and marine corps, and the Baojia self-defense corps. From 8:30 to 10:30 in the morning and from 5:00 to 7:00 in the afternoon each day, military police and Baojia personnel will be dispatched to direct traffic at major and secondary intersections in their respective districts.</p>
<h3>Military Vehicles to be Dealt With Uniformly</h3>
<p>It is reported that those who violate traffic regulations will have their citizen certificates, residence permits, driver's licenses, etc., temporarily confiscated. Pedestrians and drivers will be punished according to law after being interrogated at the police sub-bureau. For vehicles related to the authorities, the military authorities will be contacted for appropriate handling of the vehicles. A considerable number of military vehicles (excluding those related to the military) have also been found to be in violation, and strict measures must be taken in this regard. The organization consists of police officers from each sub-bureau, military police, Baojia leaders, and self-defense corps members. The Traffic Division of the Public Works Bureau will manage and direct traffic throughout the city. The first, second, third, and fourth teams of the Police Headquarters will also participate. The first team members will be responsible for liaison with the relevant sub-bureaus. The second and third teams, totaling fifty members, will be assigned fifteen to Zhabei, fifteen to Laozha, and ten to Xincheng sub-bureaus, respectively. Regarding special sentry areas, the sub-bureau chiefs will mobilize appropriate team members and Baojia corps members as possible to achieve the desired goals.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Traffic Enforcement Service</h3>
<p>(A) The main authority for traffic enforcement is the Traffic Section of the Second Division of each sub-bureau. (B) Traffic team members actively assist the Traffic Section of the Second Division of each sub-bureau. (C) Baojia self-defense corps members are convened by each sub-bureau and actively assist in implementing enforcement policies based on the district's traffic conditions, especially regarding pedestrians and rickshaws passing on the left side of the road, strict adherence to traffic signals, and pedestrians crossing the road outside designated areas. (D) Baojia self-defense corps members who detect traffic violations must immediately report to a police officer for handling, and self-defense corps members must not act unilaterally. At the same time, the Construction Bureau is responsible for painting white markings in traffic safety zones. Yellow lines are painted at major intersection crossings to indicate stopping lines for vehicles and crosswalks for pedestrians. Major intersections will have the direction of turns painted with white lines, and unnecessary parking areas will be removed. After this week, in order to promote traffic ethics among the general public, every Wednesday will be designated as "Traffic Enforcement Day," and the enforcement guidelines will be the same as those implemented this week.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industries Decide to Exchange Negotiable Instruments the Next Day; Implemented Starting This Month on the 30th</h3>
<p>The silver and money industries in this city, in view of the frequent increase in the number of negotiable instruments received by member firms from customers, have found the work of exchange, accounting, and agency exchange to be quite difficult. The clearance of balances affects manpower and resources. The increased exchange differences and the inability to complete exchanges and collections on the same day have been felt. In order to give the industry sufficient time for exchange, the joint meeting of the silver and money industries has jointly decided to actively plan and implement the exchange of negotiable instruments the next day. The board of directors of the Chamber of Commerce subsequently approved it and submitted it to the working group and subcommittees to discuss the implementation details. The matter was submitted to the joint meeting of the two industries again, and it was decided to officially implement it starting on the 30th of this month. In addition to separately notifying all banks and money houses yesterday to comply with the attached schedule, change or revise the new measures for the exchange of negotiable instruments and collection of negotiable instruments, it is especially important to note that the negotiable instruments to be exchanged on the 30th must be sorted out in advance on the 28th and 29th (the Sunday will also be open exceptionally) and sent to the Clearing House before the 30th, so that they can be presented to the paying bank at that time. Return items will also be handled in accordance with the new method. The announcements and new measures of the two industry clearinghouses are as follows:</p>
<h3>Clearing House Notice</h3>
<p>The Silver Industry Joint Clearing House issued a notice to member banks and money houses stating: This Clearing House, in accordance with the decision of the Chamber of Commerce, will change the time for exchanging negotiable instruments and collecting negotiable instruments and will implement it on July 30. The implementation measures have been stipulated and communicated to all industries for reference. As July 30 is a Monday, all negotiable instruments that each industry should receive from each other on Saturday, July 28, which are not exchanged or sent to the Clearing House for collection, will certainly be numerous. In order to ensure that these negotiable instruments can be cleared in a timely manner and that the staff of the Clearing House and the Clearing House can increase their preparations for the practical handling of the new measures, it has been decided that negotiable instruments from each exchange house that have not been exchanged on the 28th can be exchanged according to the new measures in advance on the 28th or 29th, so that they can be submitted for exchange at 9:00 am on the 30th. Negotiable instruments from each exchange house, each agency exchange house of this Clearing House, and each silver and money industry that are received on the 28th and not exchanged or collected should be sent to the Clearing House one day in advance in accordance with the new measures, and should be submitted on the 29th, which is a Sunday.</p>
<h3>Family Doctor: Why Should Everyone Have One?</h3>
<p>Briefly Tell the Readers</p>
<p>The book "Family Doctor" can be said to be a rare new work in the scientific community in recent years. It instructs many people on various scientific methods to improve nutrition, maintain health, and treat diseases. Every family should be prepared with one, and everyone must read it. The characteristics are as follows:</p>
<p>Preventing Diseases: In this day and age, getting sick is no joke. Medical expenses easily run into tens or hundreds of thousands. How depressing it is to be sick! Reading "Family Doctor" will teach you how to prevent and maintain health.</p>
<p>Proven Remedies: "Family Doctor" is the culmination of two years of hard work by Dr. Huang Shengbai, a leading German doctor. Based on common family ailments, it uses Chinese and Western medical theories and proven remedies, written in a lively style and simple language, eliminating the drawbacks of indirect solutions and providing effective cures.</p>
<p>Medical Consultant: "Family Doctor" contains seventeen treatises, covering all common diseases, such as nutrition, digestion, stomach problems, tuberculosis, infectious diseases, malaria, dysentery, venereal diseases, skin diseases, pregnancy, childcare, etc., all explained clearly and to the point. Having "Family Doctor" is like having a medical consultant and a practical library of knowledge.</p>
<p>Valuable Gifts: The printing cost alone is already over five thousand yuan per book. All those who donate five thousand yuan to the scholarship fund will receive a copy from Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory. Those who donate ten thousand yuan will receive an additional copy. More donations will result in more gifts, and it is welcome to pass them on to relatives and friends.</p>

It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically support this campaign. Students who raise five thousand yuan in donations will immediately receive a copy. More donations will result in more gifts. The content of this book is comprehensive, and it is suitable for everyone to have a copy, which is better than hiring a family medical consultant. You can enjoy the reputation of helping students and gain health benefits, truly a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Lu Donate to Disaster Relief and Education</h3>
<p>Mr. Lu Shoukang wrote in a letter: "Since the city has suffered air raids, the number of displaced compatriots has been increasing daily. Fortunately, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have been donating large sums of money, which is also the compassion that mankind should have. Disaster relief is certainly the only urgent task at present, but cultivating out-of-school youth is also an urgent task that is as important as disaster relief. Therefore, in response to your newspaper's call to 'not forget education while providing disaster relief, and not forget disaster relief while providing education,' in addition to separately donating one million yuan to the air raid relief fund, I am hereby donating one million yuan to your newspaper's ninth scholarship fund. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is hoped that it can accumulate and make a great contribution."

<h3>Upholding the Buddhist Tenet of Compassion, Serving Compatriots Affected by Air Raids: The City Buddhist Association Urges Followers</h3>
<p>Recently, the City Buddhist Association, in order to relieve air raid victims, issued a letter to all abbots and senior lay Buddhists in the city, stating in part: "The most important teaching of Buddhism is compassion. Compassion means giving happiness to humanity, and sorrow means removing human suffering. The value of the teachings left by the Buddha lies in the ability of his followers to put them into practice. If we cannot practice these teachings, we will lose our qualifications as Buddhists and tarnish the golden words of the Buddha, causing the entire Buddhist community to lose its luster. All abbots, senior lay Buddhists, men and women, you all know that this is a crucial time, a time to test whether Buddhism is beneficial to the world, whether the teachings of the Buddha and the good words spoken by Buddhists on a daily basis are redeemable checks, and whether Buddhists are purely selfish, cold-blooded, and lacking in compassion. Everything is now a great touchstone for us! Especially as we face this imminent catastrophe, we must stand tall and put the Buddha's teachings into practice, showing people the facts. We are all standing on the land of Shanghai. The danger to all of Shanghai has arrived. The lives and property of five million people are at risk. Recent air raids have deeply warned us that bombs have no eyes and explode upon impact. Rows of houses are bombed and collapse, and people die or are injured, and those who survive have no home to return to and no means of livelihood, becoming helpless people. Since we are Buddhists, and fortunately have not died today and our property has not been destroyed, we have truly experienced the impermanence of body and wealth. We should uphold the Buddhist tenet of compassion and serve our suffering compatriots. We are now establishing temporary shelters for disaster victims, using several temples in the current urban area of Shanghai as temporary lodging for those affected. The abbot designated for each temple will be the director of that shelter. The Association will do its utmost to oversee everything and fulfill its responsibilities to those affected. We hope that all abbots and Buddhist lay Buddhists, men and women, in Shanghai will stand together under the banner of the Buddha's compassion, those with strength contributing strength, those with money contributing money, practicing great compassion, acting as fearless messengers in this dangerous situation of life and death, and making the Dharma treasures spoken by our Buddha fully redeemable checks!"</p>
