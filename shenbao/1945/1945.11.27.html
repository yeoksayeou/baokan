<h3>實行民生主義努力建設　最高經濟委會成立　蔣主席親臨主持並致訓</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿六日電〕今（廿六）日下午四時，最高經濟委員會，在行政院舉行首次會議，蔣主席親臨主持。出席者有宋院長子文，孫院長科，居院長正，戴院長傳賢，翁副院長文　及行政院各部會長官。蔣主席首致訓詞，繼宋院長致詞，居院長，戴院長，孫院長均分別發表意見。茲將蔣主席訓詞原文發表如下：</p>
<p>訓詞全文</p>
<p>本委員會的設立，有一個目標，就是實行民生主義，帮助人民使所有的力量，都放在今後偉大的和平建設及發展的工作上。在我們開始工作的時候，我要坦白的向諸位說明，並由諸位轉達全國同胞幾句話，就是關於我們所面對着的許多經濟問題與復員問題，以及要解決這些問題，我們必須採取的行動。</p>
<p>我們不能因爲國內的種種不安，而忽視我們同胞企朮獲得一種較高生活水準的基本需要。在目前，我們的國家正臨到了一段驚濤駭浪的時期，這是在戰爭以後所不能避免的。在這個時期，人民的心理，感到不安及焦慮，確是很自然的。而且現在國內還不免有若干人，把黨派及個人的利益放在國家利益之上，並且猛烈的阻礙國民政府在收復各省區的復員工作，以及破壞各種經濟基礎。現在政府正在糾正這種情勢，我們要盡全力來恢復國內的秩序及安全，但是在同時，我們也要負起同樣大的責任來，帮助人民恢復戰時的捐失及破壞，並改進他們的生活狀况。國民政府現在設立這個最高經濟委員會，就是因僞認淸了目前有立即採取一種健全的經濟設施的必要。我個人對於我國的經濟建設及發展，很願意親自負責，加以指導。</p>
<p>把握當前經濟情況　不良現象採有效糾正措施</p>
<p>在進行工作的時候，我們必須把握住當前我們中國經濟情况的許多不良現象。以往八年抗戰，曾經嚴重的破壞了我們的經濟，這並不僅指城市的轟炸，以及房屋與工廠的破壞而言。在戰爭的期間，我國喪失了無數人民的生產力量，他們都被迫離開了農村，離開了城市。我們因爲敵人的封鎖，海岸也失掉了我們所需要的商業。在很多地方，日本曾整個的或部份的拆掉我們的工廠。在另外的地方，他們並曾把我們民生工業改成了他們的戰時工業。所以現在要把這些工廠復員，使其生產我國人民所需要的東西，並不是一件容易的事。目前我國的工業，有的已在停頓的狀態，有的僅維持小量的生產。大多數的勞工，都失了業，造成普遍的困苦現象。</p>
<p>這種情形是不能讓牠巡延下去，我們第一件事必須夢使人民重新得到工作，可是要想復興工業，使工人都得到工作，因爲種種的困難，確是一個很複雜的問題。我國有很多地方都缺煤，我們現在的鐵路及公路設備，絕不能滿足運輸的需要。我們也沒有充份的有訓練的管理及技術人員，去接收並經營。以前日本人所辦的事業，我們的國家財政，因爲戰費之浩繁，以及敵人之搜括，已受到很大的摧殘。我們必須把這些情形，都糾正過來，吾則我們的工業，不能希望發達。</p>
<p>我們的農業，也是同樣的大受阻碍。我國並沒有充分的現代農業原料，例如肥料，殺蟲劑，與良好的種籽。也沒有充分普遍的現代耕種智識。專家們認爲如果我們採取了這些新的方法，短期以內，收獲一定可以大增。另外一件重要的事，就是現在一般農民，都負擔了過重的地租田賦及利息。這種現象，使整個的我國農業機構，大爲削弱。現在政府對於收復區的地租，規定減收百分之二十五，並且免徵田賦，就是要想糾正這種現象的第一步措施。我國的農民，也同城市裏工業方面的勞工，及管理人員一樣，都需要政府最强有力的扶助。</p>
<p>戰後一時困苦不安　此為爭取勝利與自由代價</p>
<p>在每次大戰以後，都要有一個時期的困苦及不安，就國家整個的來講，這是爲爭取勝利及自由所付的一個很小的代價。但是我們必須承認，對於無數的人民，今年冬季就是一個嚴重的經濟難關。這個難關，需要我們人民拿出全部的毅力來應付。在這個時期，所需要的，就是一切公私生活都必須絕對的公正廉潔，這是我們歷史上一個重要的關頭，絕對不能容忍，緩慢，貪汚，或自私自利的人來榨取人民，以圖謀個人的富貴。這種人員，必須剷除並股加懲辦。</p>
<p>在這次抗戰之中，我國人民的英勇及堅忍，已經獲得全世界的讚賞。我現在可以向諸位說，並向全國同胞說，我們所受的痛苦，並不是徒然的。我並且可以吿訴諸位，在我們歷史上，從來沒有過的一個偉大的經濟機會，就要展開在我們面前。這個機會，凡是我國同胞，都可以分享。我深信在未來的幾個月中，我們一定能够，並且必須努力在和平建設及發展方而，採取準備的步驟。這個步驟，可以直接引導人民得到一種比較滿意的生活。等到我們把一切基本的狀况改善，內部的不安平息，並將各種經濟的活動展開以後，各方面的工作機會自然增多，食衣住行的必需品，更可以價廉而豐富，現在沒有的物品及勞役，將來也可以逐漸加多的供給予一般人民。</p>
<p>發揮吾人建設力量　求取各國盟友之經濟合作</p>
<p>在進行這種重要的建設及發展工作的時侯，本委員會必須認淸，我國的問題決不能祇希望別的國家來帮忙解決，我們必須自己帮助自己，我們的整個國家前途，繫於我們自己能發揮我們的建設力量。這種力量，是一個民族偉大的鎖鑰，我們所希求於我們各國盟友的，主要是在健全的基礎上獲得經濟的合作。</p>
<p>本委員會的任務，在立即給予人民以健全的帮助及指導，使他們能自己帮助自己，並採取適當步驟，以期早日得到經濟上的進步。本委員會對於政府各部會有關經濟事項之重要工作，應該密切聯繫，本委員會要考察各種事實，並且對於經濟政策方面各種問題，隨時加以切實而迅速的決斷，要注意並且督促政府有關各部會，迅速執行各項政策。這些任務，在有些方面很像戰時生產局在戰時所行使的各種職權，可是本委員會將要有更高的職權。　我們必須要明白，政府設立這個委員會，並非要想担任經濟方面一切事務性的工作和責任，反之，我相信各省市縣政府必須根據本委員會的大政方針，逐漸負起自己區域以內的經濟建設及發展的責任。唯有這樣，纔可以使各個區域都得到最大的發展，而且，健全的地方行政，是建立一個强大的民主國家的基石。同時，這也是一種方法，可以使一個國家發展私人的才幹及經營能力，這種才幹及能力，是一個民主國家經濟進步的原動力。我國的地方政府，必須要自己站起來，凡是牠們能够自己作的事，不應當依賴中央政府去作，牠們必須在可能範圍以內，採取一切步驟，改善自已境內的人民生活水準，以及工作狀况，並且要對於富地的工商及其他經濟事業，界予更多之扶助。同時，各地人民也應該信任有能力與忠於職務的地方行政長官，來解決其因地方情形而起的各種經濟問題。凡是無能或不忠於職責的地方長官，政府必隨時懲治，人民亦必須要有一個可以信賴的地方領袖，道個地方領袖，必須能刻苦耐勞，決心犧牲側人的一切，以完成其偉大的使命。</p>
<p>我主張本委員會應該用一切可能的方法，儘速完成一個全國性的運輸改改善計劃，我們第一件事，要把現有的各種運輸設備，都使我能好好的應用，此後，我們還必須努力來維持並擴展我們的設備，以達到更大更高的效率。我認爲加强我國的運輸，是我們推進經濟建設及進步的一切助力的基礎，我們所要特別重視的，是要把食糧及燃料運到缺乏的地區去。道個運輸計劃，不但要包括鐵路及海洋運輸，而且要包括公路之建築及車輛之獲得，使其能經常維持行駛。在此整個計劃之下：</p>
<p>完成運輸改善計劃</p>
<p>第一，本委員會應即籌圖並進行一全國性之公路建築方案，我相信，這一個方案如果適當的實行出來，在數年之內，一定可以較低之代價，大量增加我國的經濟力量，在這一點，我要提起本委員會注意目前在我國有一百萬以上的日本俘虜，因爲缺乏運輸工具及盟軍於高統帥在日木所遭遇種種困難，這些俘虜之遣送回國，必須逐步實行，在回國以前，這些俘虜應該讓他們作些生產工作，藉此帮助恢復一點他們所加予我國的損害。我堅決的向本委員會提出，我們在日本俘虜返國之前，要立即使用他們來帮助我國建築現代化的道路，並建設整個的運輸系統。</p>
<p>實施增進農業方案</p>
<p>第二，本委員會應立即籌劃一個增進我國農業的切實方案，並付諸實施。道一個計劃，當然要包括主要肥料，殺虫劑及改良種籽的增加生產，進口及分配以及灌輸農民之現代農業智識。本委員會也必須立刻設法滅低過高之地租及高利貸，並調整田賦，適合人民之支付能力，以改善我國農民的生活狀况。爲達到這些目的，政府已經訂定若干法規，本委員會必須負責加强這些法規，並督促其確實迅速的施行。我更進一步主張，本委員會應該籌劃一個長期的造林計劃，使我國農業區域的寳貴土壞，能以保持並可供給必要之木材，我國荒山上的造林，實在是非常重要，並且要立即開始。</p>
<p>擬訂扶助工業辦法</p>
<p>第三，本委員會應立即擬訂方案帮助各種工業，增加生產，特利是生產各種必需品的工業，例如燃料，紡織以及建築材料。在達到這個及其他經濟建設及發展的目的之先，最急要的是確定對外滙率，來穩定金融，必須儘早辦到。本委員會對於這一點，必須立即採取行動，爲進一步鼓勵大規模的工業生產起見，政府在戰時所加於工業上的種種管制，應該立即撤銷，除非在某種情形之下，撤銷管制足以影響整個的國家經濟者，得視爲例外。關於合格的工業管理人員，技術人員以及熟練工人的募集，也是應該採取直接而有效的行動，以促成其事。根據我國支付能力而定之工業器材進口辦法，應該由本委員會加以監督，藉以保證各種最主要之工業及公用事業，使能最先得到購買此項物資所需之款項及運輸工具。本委員會對於工業之生產，應該加以指導，使在國內及國外有確定市塲之物品能以生產，並減少不健全之生產。我國各銀行的利率及貸款政策，必須週全檢討並重新釐訂，以鼓勵工業生產。日木在戰時經營各種工業的眞實情况，必須明瞭，並加以分析，在這一點上，我可以報吿，經濟部方面對於日本在淪陷區內的各種經濟活動，已經搜集有很多寳貴的資料。</p>
<p>設法鼓勵對外貿易</p>
<p>第四，本委員會應該設法，鼓勵我國的對外貿易，這應該是我們的主要工作，本委員會應立即擬訂計劃，鼓勵並帮助國外所需要的各種農工產品的生產，當然這種生產應不使我國因此缺乏其他主要物品，並不能蔑視我們勞工之應得之享受。由於發展對外的貿易，我國就可以獲得外滙，以購買更多必需並且不能在國內生產的機器設備及材料。</p>
<p>第五，本委員會應該集中精力，以改善國內的衛生狀况，我們必須立即確定政策及方案，以謀各種衛生及防疫器材與設備的生產，進口與發展，與衛生方案密切有關的，還有關於改善住宅，義務敎育及其他種種的方案，都是爲建立人民經濟活動的强固社會基礎所必需的。</p>
<p>徵集經濟計劃資料</p>
<p>第六，木委員會應立即開始我政府各部會對地方機關，以及有關團體與私人徵集今後五年經濟計劃的詳細資料，這些計劃之中，有些應該儘先實行，有些可以稍後推動。我國目前是一個窮的國家，不能希望在幾年之內，承所需要的改革一起都辦到，本委員會正應該負起責任，來分析有關各種經濟計劃的種種事實，並立即對於國家經濟最有價値的計劃，給予有效的鼓勵與帮助。在這些計劃當中，我主張特別應注重治河的問題，因爲河注實在是我國一個最大的資源，健全的治河辦法，可以在幾年之內使我國得到急需的永災防制法，大的灌溉計劃，內河航運的增加，廉價的電力來源，以及人民急需的娛樂設備。由於中央政府與地方政府的密切合作，本委員會不久當可完成並實行一個全盤的經濟建設與發展的計劃。在這個計劃之下，人民所最迫切的需要，當首先予以解決。總括起來說，我希望本委會能立刻有所行動，我希望牠能採取行動，以加强我國的運輸，增加其農業及工業的生產，發展其國外貿易，改良其衛生狀况，並使其在一健全之謀取經濟進步之計劃下，開始工作。</p>
<p>願共同獻身此工作　俾人民能享受較美滿生活</p>
<p>我們全國同胞，現在需要並且必須有一個對於民生主義懷抱信心的現實基礎，等到本委員會的工作獲有成果的時侯，人民就會感覽到他們已經逐漸的得到較高的生活水準了。此外，他們也會看出，我國在國際間的成望，也一天比一天高了。只要國內能够有安寗的希望，我必盡全力，以達成這側安寗，那麼，本委員會經濟方面的成就，不久就會在我國歷史上展開一個偉大的時代。</p>
<p>我國人民經過了多年的窮困與戰爭，已經贏得了可以享受較高較美滿生活的權利，本委員會的同人，應該設法使這種較好的生活成爲事實，不是在很遠的將來，而是在最近的目前。本委員會的職責，在迅速有效的工和，以滿足人民的需要。在此地此時，我們共同獻身於這個偉大的工作。（完）</p>
<h3>社論　當前的經濟政策　讀主席訓詞有感</h3>
<p>昨日下午最高經濟委員會在行政院舉行第一次會議，主席親自出席致訓，很鄭重的指示了當前經濟政策的全貌。我們午夜以後爲此文時，雖還沒有接到完全的電文，但已可窺見共重點之所在。　主席在訓詞中，重視生產事業的恢復，人民生活的安定，與生活水準的提高。這犖犖大端，實在就是目前人民所昕夕以求的理想。果眞全國上下一致遵循　主席的指示去努力，理想自可見諸事實。</p>
<p>國父早經明示：建國之首要在民生。故此次主席訓詞，開宗明義，就說最高經濟委員會的設立，其目標就是實行民生主義。可見建國不能不從經濟上着手。孔子首稱足食，孟子侈言王通，即以好言仁義薄視功利的儒家，其論政尙不外先求足其衣食，然後施以敎化。何况現代國家，已進入國際經濟競爭劇烈的時代，無論以農立國，或以工業商業立國，其重心自更不能離開經濟。在今日談政治，早與經濟打成一片。漢視經濟的設施，而希望政治進步，殆爲絕無可能之事。我國承八年抗戰之後，民力凋敝，生產毀敗，允非亟起直逍，努力復典，斷不足以圖存，更何能談到建國？　生席昭示，對今後經濟設施，自願負起指導的貴任，可知其關懷之深切。</p>
<p>主席訓詞全文要旨，包括甚廣，自治標言之，則爲民生之安定，與元氣之恢復。自治本言之，則爲農工人力之培義，與生活水準之提高。總括一句話，　主席所時刻懸念着的，就是要如何使得民衆咸能安居樂業，共享民康物阜的幸福。而對於怎樣使失業的人們重新獲得工作，允在苦心焦慮，統籌規劃之中。這種己飢己溺的精神，應該可以感動大家，共同來努力推行經濟政策，以貫澈主席的目的。</p>
<p>經濟範圍，包含至廣，故需要各方面之協力。經濟設施，須得其人，故不可不從整頓吏治入手。整頓史治，其權在上。</p>
<p>主席對於一般貪汚放縱自私自利之徒，旣已深惡痛絕，則今後循名核實，激濁揚淸，自必雷厲風行，不至重負人民之喁望。但是如何救死扶傷，努力建設，使停工者復工，失業者得業，則其責又不專在於政府。如政府力謀交通恢復，工礦增產，而竟有人破壞鐵路，損毀礦煤，以阻擾政府在收復區的復員工作，諸如此類，喪心病狂的舉動，都是應該對目前的民生因苦負重大的責任的。政府近來正在努力糾正這種情勢，人民更應協力克制這種阻撓建設的惡勢力，方可期望民生趨於安定。主席說：「歷史上從來沒有過的一個偉大的經濟機會，將展開在我們的面前。」誠然，我們面臨此種偉大的經濟機會，究將如何遵循指示，擁護國策，各守其分，各盡其　，就看我們的自擇、</p>

<p>〔大華社重慶航訊〕欲求教育收效宏大，端賴優良教師之不斷努力。欲使優良教師能安心服務，必須令其</p>
<p>改善理由</p>
<p>能維持最低限度之生活。戰前一般教師之生活已較清苦，事變以來，物價高昂，教員薪水，益不能與之相比，個人生活已成問題，更何能仰事俯畜。情勢至此，自難禁其見機活動，更何能強其揚腹從公。且各教員因生活不能解決，身體既因不獲相當營衛而欠佳，興趣亦據焦慮苦悶而減少，則教育效率之低落退步，誠為勢所必然。察省教育廳有鑒於此，故特擬具改善教師待遇辦法，呈請教育部統籌實施。茲錄原辦法如下：</p>
<p>實施辦法</p>

<h3>晨友盃籃球賽　梁溪勝晨友　恊興大勝飛馬</h3>
<p>晨友盃籃球，昨日兩幕，逐鹿結果，恊興以卅六比十六大勝飛馬，梁溪則以卅八比廿八力挫晨友。</p>
<p>飛馬實力既弱，演出復劣，以致如卵投石，毫無反抗餘地，前半時中，僅吳俊堅之一射，張洽之一罰，點綴三分，協興以二十比三　領。後半協興不為已甚，致過程比較接近，總結以卅六比十六大勝。但協興昨日並未在正常狀態中，否則差數勢必更鉅。</p>

<h3>國立臺北大學之目標</h3>
<p>— 羅宗洛</p>
<p>大學之目的，在於真理之探求，為人羣謀福利。世界各國大學之制度，容有不同，然其理想則一，故有「學術無國界」之說。臺北大學將來必須負起此崇高之任務，不可以臺灣之大學自居，局促於小範圍之內。要知取法乎上，僅得於中，取法乎中，僅得於下，吾人可從小處着手，但目標不可不高遠。牛津大學設置於牛津，故名，但牛津大學，不是牛津一地方之大學，乃英國大學，亦世界之大學。劍橋大學亦然。臺北大學雖以臺北得名，然非臺灣之大學，乃中國之國立大學，吾人必須努力，使成為世界之大學。辦理大學，必須有如是高遠之理想，若以近視的眼光，功利的思想來辦理，則斷不能成為真正之大學。</p>
<p>臺北大學之前身，為日本臺北帝國大學，創立於二十年前（民國十四年開始籌備）。奔走規劃者，實為大島金太郎先生，大島氏抱有高遠之理想，籌備時雖以開發臺灣之產業為辭，實在期造成一完備的農業科學之殿堂。氏雖不幸早故，未能完全實現其抱負，然臺北帝國大學農學部，能具如此之規模，未始非氏抱有高遠理想之結果，可資吾人之借鏡。希望臺灣同胞，對於此點有明白之認識，不要以此臺北大學為臺灣之大學，放大眼光，共同協力，使臺北大學成為具有世界性之學術殿堂，可與牛津劍橋比美。</p>

<h3>洛基將軍明日返津　昨對記者談華北局勢嚴重　在渝首次謁見蔣主席商談大針</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕駐華北美海軍陸戰隊司令洛基將軍，前晚偕其參謀長羅頓將軍由渝來滬，定明（廿八）日返津。洛基氏離津時，曾與東北保安司令杜聿明將軍及其參謀長趙家議中將晤談，但一切計劃與商討結果，似未至發表程度。洛基氏在渝時，下褟蔣主席私郎，昨午渠在滬接見記者，據稱：彼日前赴渝，首次謁見蔣主席，商談大計，對主席盛意，至表股謝，並謂，蔣夫人身體欠佳，頗有來滬調息之意。</p>
<p>美決挽救當前危局</p>
<p>今日華北局勢誠爲嚴重，似較吾人所預料者欠佳，但美軍必在完成任務後始行撤退，吾人必有所行動，以挽救當前危局。駐防華北之美海軍陸戰隊共有五萬人，雖大部均患思鄉病，但渠個人對本身工作至感愉快，並以協助國軍完成任務爲榮，中國政府向美請求船隻運兵北上事，至今未得確切答覆。</p>
<p>共軍襲擊日有發生</p>
<p>華北美軍駐防地，遠至秦皇島爲止，東北九省內全無美軍，而美軍大部則駐防天津，現已兩月，可能再留天津兩月至半年，一切均視華北情形之發展與華府命令決定。因駐軍數目龐大，故所需供應是亦多，物資運輸頻繁，且供應品必自秦皇島運至天津·北平，共產軍騷擾與襲擊之事，日有發生，美軍則盡可能作生命與財產之保護行動，至於所謂採取軍事行動問題，非不可能，但當有所顧慮，即不願無辜人民之被殃及也。華北日眾大部已繳械，但仍有一部奉令駐守鐵路及祖任防衛之責。</p>
<p>駐津美主要員一斑</p>
<p>現在天津方面海軍陸戰隊司令部有數人，（一）洛　（Rockay）將軍，（二）柏克（Peck）將軍，（三）薛浦海（Shepherd）將軍，（四）伍期（Woods）將軍，（五）詹森（Johnson）將軍，（六）斯諾將軍。在北平則有環氏（Jones）將軍，被等於戰爭期間，曾作戰各地，今年秋乃奉調來華北。洛基氏對美海軍陸戰隊今後在華北之動向，始終未作表示，但知美海軍陸戰隊絕不會在此複雜環境中引退，因美軍任務尚在繼續進行中。</p>
<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>揣測紛紜中　金價軋跌四萬</h3>
<p>美鈔有八折說</p>
<p>金融　烚赤昨（二十六日）因蔣主席對經濟施策將發表演詞，人心恍惚，大勢趨疲，惟低後不乏補空，加之市上對外滙掛牌價，揣測紛紜，莫衷一是，疲後轉形恍惚，內地金市略有報小，開後即破八十萬大關，逐步降至七十六萬光景，午收以補空趨湧，遂被拉上，一度回好至七卞九萬，午後徘徊於七十八萬內，結果較上週六回跌四萬，一般人心對蔣主席壓低物價，穩定幣値，咸加深切之期望，但對美滙兌之商確，則見仁見智，各有不同，黃金價格是否掛低，以與美鈔軋平，或抬高美滙，以吻合黃金收買價，莫衷一是，惟以一千三之美鈔計算，金價終嫌過高耳，銀樓飾金掛八萬四，亦較上週六低三千元，紋銀掛牌未更，仍爲每兩六百五十元，因而銀元欲漲乏勁，繼續徘徊於四百三左右。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔因金市圓跌，初開即退爲一三二〇元，俄而又破入一千三大關，市上傳說美滙掛牌將低於黑市二成之訊，曾降至一二八〇元，嗣後遂因金價低後　好，盤旋於一千三內外，結果較上週六回跌三十元，港幣亦然，英鎊雖有貶値之謠，但香港美鈔行市跌至五元零，兩說相抵，以致雖跌而尚平，結果舊港幣下挫二十五元，新貨跌三元，漢鎊三千一，羅比二百八，均屬買價。</p>
<p>公債　昨以股市不能公開買賣，一般游資重又集中，加之大戶對金市觀望，亦來從中活動，以致形成求過於供，粥少僧多之槪，各債一致向榮，結果漲起二十餘元至五十元不等，一般心理對公債將來之還本，咸抱種種奢望，收後繼續步畀，市勢殊俏　華股本已作流動性之賣買，昨更受證劵大樓關係人員之勸阻，活動更爲不便，塲外喊價時斷時續，結果較上週六巨型股仍平，小型股則跌一成弱，此乃散戶紛謀了結，有以至之也。</p>
<p>外股亦因種種不便，塲外交易竟有絕迹六勢，除怡和紗廠約自一千四百至一千五百有人注意外，餘均無人顧問。</p>
<h3>用美棉的利弊（小）</h3>
<p>花紡紗，紗織布。過程似乎十分簡單。　但是花從那裏來？是否勝利號裝來的五千包可以供給全市大小已開工紗廠二十萬錠子的運轉？</p>
<p>以往，花商以花五担可向紗廠掉紗一件，逐漸由五担而七担，而七担半，甚至有以十一担掉一件的。紗廠的交易條件似乎逐漸在占優勢。是否外花供給造就了道優勢？</p>
<p>陝花已久不來滬。通花在最近局勢之下　期十分通鴨。本地花衣的品種旣雜且次。在加緊生產之前提下，本國原料的供應補給大成問題，祇得仰賴外棉。這個罅漏，說大不大，說小不小，總非建國根本之道。</p>
<p>購買外棉，需要外滙頭寸。筆者絕對擁護外滙管理，但同時也主張生產管理。在建國的階段中，國民應該節衣縮食，似乎不需要以實量的外滙來採擾高貴原料，以應市面的『急需』。</p>
<p>據說美棉的成本祇及國棉的三分之二，故採用美棉無異在帮助政府抑低物價。但使用外滙的最高原則，在因而能獲得更多的外滙。如果僅僅以抑平物價爲目標，則其代價似乎太大了些。</p>
<p>花是紗布的主要原料，我國不缺乏種植地，爲甚麼不在改良耕作和通暢運輸上着想呢？</p>
<p>據說：滬上織機共有一萬八千台，每天產量可達三萬六千疋。這就是說，每人籌消耗稱　至少一千件。到目前爲止，在運轉中的紗錠共祇二十萬錠。每天產量爲五百件。即使能全部供給商用，　機之能運轉者還祇打得個對折。</p>
<p>又據說：滬上染缸共有一千四百對，每天共可產色布十四萬疋。假定目前織機能全部開工，又全部供給加工，還祇供應得四分之一。何况織布的原料違發生問題。</p>
<p>根據以上二點，可知我國企業的分佈及設置，向來就未通盤籌劃過。進一步　：可見國資工業的大部份原料來源，向來就倚賴着外貨。</p>
<p>紗布是民衣之所自。計劃經濟是今後建國的要圖。於此似不無有計劃計劃的必要吧。</p>
<h3>同業公會新人選</h3>
<p>吳震等聯合同業七家，發起上海市化學原料製造業同藥公會，主管機關，以其性質與化學原料業相同，令併入該業公會。</p>

<p>擲絨三等被委爲人力車業公會整委。</p>
<h3>市況一斑</h3>
<p>米市　昨日米市售主甚堅，店方納胃平常，是以欲漲無力，高貨則依然平站，中次者略升二三百元，形勢早堅午定，糯米微升一二百元，麵粉胃呆，續疲近百元。</p>
<p>油餅　油價因靑島來貨陸纘，零銷淸淡，生油豆油再落千元之譜，淸油菜油尚平，豆餅因裝運台灣，充作肥料，致銷路較活。</p>
<p>雜爆裂　黃豆到銷兩稀，惟油廠已有數家開工，原料不無關係，市勢趨入暫定之格。</p>
<p>紗布　紗市價疲銷淡，仍無起色，各帮雖有納胃，然因出廠納稅手續麻煩，費時費事，致客帮均取觀望態度，目下各紗廠雖有意供售，換買美棉，奈因去路沉寂，致紗價前途似乏進展，細布客帮染廠胃納不佳，惟本街略有交易，價格平疲，名牌士林及其他色布客銷尚佳，漂布因存底單薄，兼有客銷，故市價堅穏。</p>
<p>煤市　人心依舊閑散，進戶咸抱觀望態度，除高檔各貨，仍爲持有者扳持，餘均續呈疲勢，前日又有美輸一艘，由秦皇島裝到開平特別層八千七百噸，撥供電力公司用，昨日已開始卸貨，柴炭市况極爲平靜，浙東各路繼續有到貨，行方逢低即吸，價較前無甚變化。</p>
<p>五金　市面頗爲閑散，各貨行情皆呈外强中　氣象，蓋執貨者多抱觀望態度，不願貶價出售，而廠家所存原料，尚足應付一時，亦無採購之意，是故交易淸淡，貨價一時難望轉好。</p>
<p>南北貨　市况平疲，緣各路來貨甚鮮，實銷呆滯，亦因購買力薄弱所致，且交通未暢，物價亦尚在動盪之問，漲度已烈，不致再起波動。</p>
<p>染料　昨日染料市况，因實銷淸淡，故價格讀趨下降，客帮銷路亦呆。</p>
<p>茶市　昨日人心仍露挺意，去化絡繹，買戶吸胃濃，行情由呆而高，結果比上週俱報軋升，計上品祁門茶每担躍升至三萬二千五百元，中品雙薰較上週漲一萬元强，每担竄叩十萬元大關，其他花色，均稱俏俐。</p>
<h3>戰後新企業　薄荷油廠兩家</h3>
<p>薄荷油之製　事業，爲近年新興企業之一。抗戰勝利，前途尤爲光明，近悉本埠鉅商徐寄廎等發起組織一薄荷油製煉廠，資本額國幣二千萬元，由發起人認募足額，不再招股，定名爲福華薄荷油製煉廠股份有限公司，專以提煉及買賣爲業務，同時並經營其相關之附屬事業，除徐氏外，同時聞亦有人正在組織此項工廠，已有頭緒云。</p>

<h3>取締乘客　攀附電車</h3>

<h3>美軍剩餘物資　定下月初發售</h3>
<p>〔本報專訊〕美當局將於十二月一日，在滬設立國外清理事務處，負責依美政府指示，發售巨額美軍乘餘物資。該事務處已內定由強生將軍主持。據悉美乘餘物資包括飛機·卡車·建築材料·醫藥品·衣著·食品等·一般人估計在·剩餘物品，價値約在美金三萬萬元以上。該物資將在語本報記者：在滬發售之物資，除屬於海軍者尚在途中外，其餘已全部集中滬地。其中一部分將以平價發售於本市民營機關，然依美政府所定辦法，善後救濟總署，中國政府機關，及各慈善團體，將有優先採購之權。關於申請發售程序，該事務所刻尚未接到正式指示。</p>

<h3>民智開了</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>抗戰的暴風雨，打開了中國民答之門！</p>
<p>中國人民一般敎育程度的落後，是無庸說言的事。對於國事和世界大局，中國的民衆過去因爲不能管，不敢管。也管不了，因此大多採取不聞不問的態度。自從抗戰以來，這個態度大變了。大家因爲切身的利害與生死的關係，不能不關心時事和世局，因此民智大開。為了戰事的關係，一般民衆對於中國和世界的地理，增加了不少的認識。有許多從來沒有廳見過的地名，出現在報紙上，也出現在小孩的口中了。關於第一次世界大戰，以及國際聯盟的史實，大家也逐漸熟悉起來。</p>
<p>在抗戰中國的陪都重慶，這種事實尤其表現得明顯。我們時常可以看見黃包車夫在看報，目不識丁的轎夫和女傭都會對你大談其國家大事。這在過去都是很少看見的事，現在已經逐漸普遍起來了。</p>
<p>我覺得抗戰至少使民智早開了二年。</p>
<p>中國抗戰的另外一大收穫，我以爲是民智的進步。</p>

<h3>戰後巴黎拉丁區</h3>
<p>— 沈翊鵾</p>
<p>巴黎的拉丁區自十三世紀以來，就是世界各地學生的流浪中心，今日它使法國政府感覺頭痛。</p>
<p>成千衣衫襤褸的學生，在巴黎大學陰影下的街道上徘徊着，尋找房屋和書本。他們之中有許多是從德國人的集中營歸來的。</p>
<p>擁塞在拉丁區迂迴街道上的小旅館，都有着精明的店主，他們知道把房間租給過路的夫婦，比租給學生可以賺到更多的錢。所以敎育部不得不把去春歸來戰俘，徵用的旅館索團。有許多旅館離開大學達數哩之遠。</p>
<p>拉丁區的其他旅館，被美國氣十字會及盟軍佔用。一位官員說：『我們也許得替這些學生建造營房。』</p>
<p>巴黎大學今年註册的學生，比一九三〇年以來任何一年都多。但學生的生活費用已增漲了四五倍。由於紙張不够，書籍大感缺乏。食物也頗難獲得。敎育部已設廉價食堂，學生們只要花幾個法朗就可以簡單地吃一頓。但今冬怕有探凍之虞。</p>
<p>潘案一帶頃斜人行道側的咖啡館，座客寥寥無幾。法國大作家伏爾泰與左拉就是　在潘桑的。</p>
<p>一個二十七歲的學生說：『啤酒的價錢已比戰前貴了四倍，而且現在沒有好酒。』他做了五年戰俘，現在又重新開始大學生生涯了。</p>
<p>這個過去巴黎最愉快的地方，最顯著的改變特點，是著名的克魯尼博物院旁的一個大招牌，上面寫着：「學生諸君！勿忘療養院中的同學，請捐助國家學生療養會。』許多年輕的法國人，由德國歸來以後，身體壞得無法就學。</p>
<p>法國大學每星期平均接到一百封美國人寄來的信，他們請求到這裏來讀書。但是由於食宿都很困難，恐怕沒有一個美國人能來，不過有幾百個美國兵將在該校聽講。</p>
<p>學術</p>
<h3>從舉講座說起</h3>
<p>— 錦江</p>
<p>本年初，本市舉辦各種形式的講座蓬勃一時的時候，有某銀行曾用學校的形式，舉辦了一所商業講座。在當時的社會中，倒是別開生面的一種事業。</p>
<p>爲了要使多方面對商業發生興趣起見，凡自願參加的，都不加考慮學員的年齡和程度，而一律加以收納。於是，因爲上述的原因，頗使講師感到敎導的非易；也爲了這原因，使大部分學生不能發生好感。結果是，學員名額自四百五十人遞減至五十人！</p>
<p>這五十名眞正爲學習而來的學員，其中包括銀行從業員，學生，老闆，工程師，學徒以及雜貨店的櫃友。從年齡上計算，則自十六歲起至四十歲不等。若從程度上講，有小學畢業的，有大學二年級的，欲從這樣複雜的分子中，尋覓一綫舉辦講座的成績，眞是談何容易啊！而結束的時候，仍是這五十名令落地在串演這幕戲。毫無成績可嘗。</p>
<p>中國難道不需要　座的形式來闡發學術嗎？不，決不，紙是需要的太少了。</p>
<p>就說上月某日　弢先生在靑年會講演吧，名大學主辦，講題也新穎有趣，起初索劵聽講的就有七百人之多，更有許多人欲趨而無劵可索的，盛况該是空前吧！但，不，開會的時候，到會的祇三百人光影，還有中途退出的不計在內。由此可見欲在中國舉辦學術講座，眞是一件不易討好的工作。（有人說：還是聽說書有趣！）</p>
<p>根據我們的經騐：夜校還不是一樣？補習學校還不是一樣？是以日後描除文盲的工作，還應該從完全小學做起，從學齡兒童着手為妙！</p>

<h3>細胞毒素廳蹟</h3>
<p>— 壽者</p>
<p>新近在莫斯科某科學學會中，蘇聯科學家彼得白斯斟報告他新發現的細胞毒素，以及這毒素在實騐中所得到的種種驚人效力。</p>
<p>據彼得白斯基實騐結果，施用細胞毒素後，可以使牛出產更多的奶，可以使雞產更多的蛋，可以使其他的動物增强生產率。細胞毒素是血淸中自然構成的一種毒素，毒素有好多種，每一種專侵襲一種器官或一部份細肥組織。譬如’有腎臟細胞毒素，有肝臟細胞毒素，等等。每種的功能現在都在研究中。</p>
<p>彼得白斯基施用輕量的某種細胞毒素後，可使牛產奶的量增加百分之六十五。施於雞身上，可使不產卵的雞產卵，使產卵的雞的產量驟增，一向不孕的馬施用母素後，居然產小馬，生下十個星期的小猪施用毒素後，經過七個月，體重平均比平常的猪重百分之二十。</p>
<p>動物施用輕量的細胞毒素後，並沒有甚麼不良的反應，每次祇某一部份器官受到刺激後，顯得略微擴大些。</p>

<h3>廢物不能利用</h3>
<p>— 林保</p>
<p>不久以前碰到一位留學回來的市政專家，他慨嘆着說中國連垃圾也不及外國的好。大家都覺得奇怪，以爲這又是外國月亮比中國圖的一流人物。後來問明原委，才知道這是一個事實。</p>
<p>他說幾年前上海工部局花了不少的錢在檳榔路二號建了一間大房子，裏面有種種焚燒垃圾的設備，預備像外國的大城市那樣，把垃圾燒掉了。旣合衛生原則，又可得到不少有用的副產品。這種方法呌做垃圾消滅法，外國在一八九〇年起就應用了。把垃圾放在緊閉的管中，用蒸氣去熱它，同時並用機器授拌加熱中的垃圾，使垃圾分解成水汽，油脂，和固體含氮的物質。油脂可以造肥皂，固體可以肥田。眞可說是一舉數得。</p>
<p>工部局在上海試了很短的一段時期，不料卻失敗了。失敗的原因是中國太窮了，以致中國的垃圾也不及外國的垃圾好。因爲上海的垃圾都經過貧家的孩子幾度的挑剔，把其中的爛布，廢紙等東西都檢掉了，結果所剩下的往往是一些無用的玻璃碎或破鐵　，要燒也沒有法子燒，更提不出油脂和含　的固體物質這一類値錢的副產品了。工部局爲省煤起見，祇好把這所準備燒垃圾的房子關了起來。因此中國的廢物竟至無法可以利用。</p>
<p>現在這所有着大烟囪高聳在蘇州河畔的大房子，已經改爲上海工廠聯合醫院，這也不失是廢物利用吧。</p>

<h3>敵人（The　Enemy）（六）</h3>
<p>— 賽珍珠著　朱綺譯</p>
<p>花子問：『你是不是說他會在施行手術時死去？』</p>
<p>貞雄說：『是的。』</p>
<p>花子頗爲懷疑地想了一想，她還沒有回答，貞雄已轉身過去。他說『無論如何總得想個辦法。第一件事是給他洗一下。』他很快的走了出去，花子跟着他。她不願單獨和這白種人留着。自從她離開美國以後，他還是她第一個看見的白種人。他好像和她在美國所看見的白種人完全不同。他在這裏不論是死是活，總是她的敵人，使她感受到一種威脅</p>
<p>她轉身到嬰兒室裏，喊道：『弓子！』</p>
<p>可是孩子們聽見了她的聲音，所以她必須進去一會，對他們笑笑，和那個出世將近三個月的小男嬰玩玩。</p>
<p>俯身在那孩子的軟軟的黑髪上面，她呶呶嘴說：『弓子，跟我來！』</p>
<p>弓子答道：『我得先讓這孩子睡妥貼，他要睡了。』</p>
<p>她和弓子走進嬰兒室隔壁的臥室裏，她站着抱住嬰孩，弓子將被褥舖在地上，再將孩子放下去睡好。</p>
<p>花子急忙輕輕地帶她走到廚房裏。廚房裏的兩個傭人已聽見了主人告訴他們的話，十分害怕。那老園丁扯着唇上的幾根鬍鬚。</p>
<p>他率直地對花子說：『主人不該醫這白種人的傷，這人是註定了要死的。他先給槍打了。後來海又捉住了他，海中的岩石碰傷了他。如果主人將槍和海所傷害的醫好了，它們會來向我們報仇的。』</p>
<p>花子恭恭敬敬地說：『我要將你說的話告訴他。』她雖然不像那老頭子那樣的迷信，可是也很害怕。帮助敵人那會是一件好事？可是她終於呌弓子拿熱水到那白種人躺蔚的那間屋子裏去。</p>
<p>她走在前面，拉開了兩間房間中間的門。貞雄還沒有來。跟在後面的弓子放下了她的木製的水桶。她走近了那白種人。她一見那人，她那對厚的嘴唇就固執地緊閉了起來。她說：『我從不曾洗過一個白種人。現在我更不想洗一個這樣　的白種人。』</p>
<p>花子對她厲聲說道：『你得聽你主人的命令！』</p>
<p>弓子頑固地說：『我的主人是不應該命令我去洗一個敵人的。』</p>
<p>在弓子呆滯的圓臉上，有一種極凶狠的反抗，使花子毫無理由地害怕起來。如果傭人去報告了一些虛構的事實又怎麼辦？</p>
<p>她莊嚴地說：『好得很。你要知道我們祇想將他弄淸醒了，好將他當作俘虜交出。』</p>
<p>弓子說：『我不想和這事發生什麼關係，我是個窮人，這不是我的事。」</p>
<p>花子溫和地說：『那末請你還是去做你自己的工作去吧。』</p>
<p>弓子立刻走了出去。這樣一來，就祇剩下花子一個人和那白種人在一起了。要不是弓子的頑固引起了她的怒氣的話，她也許會不敢留在那裏的。</p>
<p>她狠狠地喃喃說道：『蠢弓子，難道他不是個人，一個受傷無助的人嗎？』</p>

<p>渣滓敗類除惡務盡</p>
<p>我國八年抗戰，在蔣委員長領導之下，全面動員，上下一體，終於獲得最後勝利。如今，痛定思痛，犧牲浩大，可勝算！但一般人往往只注意到物質的報告，而忽視了精神的心理的損失。物質是有形的，所以容易發覺；精神是無形的，當然不容易發覺。然而論其重要性，物質與精神，實有同樣的重要。什麼是精神的損失呢？那就是「道德淪亡」，一個獨立自由的國家，人民共同生活於健全的社會，倘使人們都沒有道德心，那還成什麼社會？即使物質文明，而終不免於破產，其理至明，不容諱言。</p>
<p>八年來的自由區，姑置勿論，要說淪陷區，尤其象上海這大都會，大家嚷着說：「人心破產，不成社會！」除了少數堅吾忠貞，威武不屈，其次是安分守己，保持淸正的人以外，一般人所作爲，眞是惡劣萬分。舉例言之：如（一）趨炎附勢欺壓弱小，（二）投機奸商，重利輕義；（三）詐欺取財，寡廉鮮恥；（四）無理取閙，橫生是非；最可恨者，是勾結敵僞，賣國求榮；跡其行徑，罪不可恕！我們主張上面第一等人，應請中央明令嘉獎，（按第三方面軍政治部正在調查辦理中）最劣等的，應遵照懲治漢奸條例，多方偵查，除惡務盡。民族敗類，如果放縱寬恕，社會永不安寗，國家亦難上法治的正軌。</p>
<p>本欄首先發起「重振道德運動」，把過去黑白不分，是非混淆的陰霾，一掃而空，迎天地正氣，重上光明之途，並望政府根據新生活運動，訂立「國民公約」使大衆有所準繼，纔可以言重振道德，甚望讀者諸君，奮起推動，社會幸甚，（歡迎讀者來函表示意兌，擇允發表。）</p>

<h3>Striving to Implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and Diligently Building the Nation: The Supreme Economic Council is Established with Chairman Chiang Presiding and Delivering Instructions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] At 4:00 PM today (the 26th), the Supreme Economic Council held its first meeting at the Executive Yuan, presided over by Chairman Chiang. Attendees included President of the Executive Yuan, T.V. Soong; President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke; President of the Control Yuan, Yu Zheng; President of the Examination Yuan, Dai Chuanxian; Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao; and ministers of various ministries of the Executive Yuan. Chairman Chiang first delivered instructions, followed by speeches from President Soong, President Yu, President Dai, and President Sun, who each expressed their views. The full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions is published below:</p>
<p>Full Text of Instructions</p>
<p>The establishment of this committee has one goal: to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, to help the people, and to dedicate all our strength to the great work of peaceful reconstruction and development in the future. As we begin our work, I want to frankly explain to you, and through you to our fellow countrymen, a few words about the many economic and recovery problems we face, and the actions we must take to solve them.</p>
<p>We cannot ignore the basic need of our fellow countrymen to attain a higher standard of living because of the domestic unrest. Currently, our country is facing a period of turbulent waves, which is unavoidable after the war. During this period, it is very natural for the people to feel uneasy and anxious. Moreover, there are still some people in the country who put the interests of parties and individuals above the interests of the nation, and fiercely obstruct the recovery work of the National Government in the recovered provinces and regions, and destroy various economic foundations. The government is now correcting this situation, and we must do our best to restore domestic order and security, but at the same time, we must also bear the equally great responsibility to help the people recover from the wartime losses and damages, and improve their living conditions. The National Government has now established this Supreme Economic Council because it recognizes the need to immediately adopt sound economic measures. I personally am very willing to take personal responsibility for the economic construction and development of our country, and to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Grasp the Current Economic Situation and Adopt Effective Corrective Measures for Unfavorable Phenomena</p>
<p>As we proceed with our work, we must grasp the many unfavorable phenomena in China's current economic situation. The eight years of the War of Resistance have severely damaged our economy, which refers not only to the bombing of cities and the destruction of houses and factories. During the war, our country lost the productive power of countless people, who were forced to leave the countryside and the cities. Because of the enemy's blockade, we also lost the commerce we needed from the coast. In many places, the Japanese completely or partially dismantled our factories. In other places, they even converted our civilian industries into their wartime industries. Therefore, it is not an easy task to restore these factories and have them produce what our people need. Currently, some of our country's industries are at a standstill, and some are only maintaining a small amount of production. The majority of laborers have lost their jobs, creating a widespread phenomenon of hardship.</p>
<p>This situation cannot be allowed to continue. The first thing we must do is to enable the people to regain employment. However, in order to revitalize industry and enable workers to find jobs, it is indeed a very complex problem because of various difficulties. Many places in our country lack coal, and our current railway and highway facilities are by no means able to meet the needs of transportation. We also do not have a sufficient number of trained management and technical personnel to take over and manage the businesses previously run by the Japanese. Our national finances have been greatly devastated because of the enormous wartime expenses and the enemy's plunder. We must correct these situations, otherwise our industries cannot hope to develop.</p>
<p>Our agriculture has also been greatly hampered. Our country does not have sufficient modern agricultural materials, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and good seeds. Nor is there sufficient widespread modern farming knowledge. Experts believe that if we adopt these new methods, the harvest can certainly be greatly increased in the short term. Another important thing is that the average farmer now bears too heavy a burden of land rent, taxes, and interest. This phenomenon greatly weakens the entire agricultural structure of our country. The government's current regulations on reducing land rent by 25% and exempting land taxes in the recovered areas are the first step in correcting this phenomenon. The farmers of our country, like the laborers and managers in the industrial sector in the cities, need the strongest support from the government.</p>
<p>Temporary Hardship and Unease After the War are the Price of Striving for Victory and Freedom</p>
<p>After every great war, there will be a period of hardship and unease. From the perspective of the whole country, this is a very small price to pay for striving for victory and freedom. But we must admit that for countless people, this winter is a serious economic crisis. This crisis requires our people to bring out all their perseverance to cope with it. During this period, what is needed is absolute fairness and integrity in all public and private life. This is a critical juncture in our history, and it is absolutely intolerable for slow, corrupt, or selfish people to exploit the people in order to seek personal wealth. Such personnel must be eliminated and severely punished.</p>
<p>During this War of Resistance, the bravery and perseverance of our people have won the praise of the whole world. I can now say to you, and to our fellow countrymen, that the suffering we have endured has not been in vain. I can also tell you that never before in our history has such a great economic opportunity been unfolding before us. This opportunity can be shared by all our fellow countrymen. I firmly believe that in the coming months, we will definitely be able to, and must strive to, take preparatory steps in the area of peaceful reconstruction and development. This step can directly lead the people to a more satisfactory life. When we have improved all the basic conditions, quelled the internal unrest, and expanded various economic activities, the opportunities for work in all aspects will naturally increase, and the necessities of food, clothing, housing, and transportation will become cheaper and more abundant. The goods and services that are currently lacking will gradually be increased and supplied to the general public.</p>
<p>Utilize Our Construction Strengths and Seek Economic Cooperation with Allied Nations</p>
<p>In carrying out this important work of construction and development, this committee must recognize that our country's problems cannot be solved by merely hoping that other countries will help. We must help ourselves. The entire future of our country depends on our ability to exert our construction strengths. This strength is the key to a great nation. What we seek from our allied nations is primarily economic cooperation on a sound basis.</p>
<p>The task of this committee is to immediately give the people sound help and guidance, so that they can help themselves, and take appropriate steps to achieve economic progress as soon as possible. This committee should closely coordinate with the important work of various government ministries related to economic matters. This committee should examine various facts and make practical and rapid decisions on various issues in economic policy at any time. It should pay attention to and supervise the relevant government ministries to implement various policies quickly. These tasks, in some respects, are similar to the various powers exercised by the War Production Board during the war, but this committee will have even higher powers. We must understand that the government's establishment of this committee is not intended to take on all the administrative work and responsibilities in the economic field. On the contrary, I believe that the governments of each province, city, and county must gradually assume responsibility for economic construction and development within their own regions, in accordance with the general policies of this committee. Only in this way can each region achieve the greatest development, and sound local administration is the cornerstone of building a strong democratic country. At the same time, this is also a way to develop the private talents and management capabilities of a country, which is the driving force of economic progress in a democratic country. The local governments of our country must stand on their own feet. Anything they can do themselves should not rely on the central government to do it. They must take all possible steps to improve the living standards and working conditions of the people within their own borders, and give more support to local industrial, commercial, and other economic undertakings. At the same time, the people of each locality should also trust the capable and dedicated local administrative officials to solve the various economic problems that arise from the local situation. Any local officials who are incompetent or disloyal to their duties must be punished by the government at any time, and the people must also have a local leader they can trust, a local leader who must be able to endure hardship and be determined to sacrifice everything personal in order to accomplish his great mission.</p>
<p>I propose that this committee should complete a nationwide transportation improvement plan as soon as possible by all possible means. The first thing we must do is to make good use of all the existing transportation equipment. After that, we must also strive to maintain and expand our equipment to achieve greater and higher efficiency. I believe that strengthening our country's transportation is the foundation of all our efforts to promote economic construction and progress. What we must pay special attention to is to transport food and fuel to areas that lack them. This transportation plan should include not only railways and maritime transportation, but also the construction of highways and the acquisition of vehicles, so that they can be maintained in constant operation. Under this entire plan:</p>
<p>Complete the Transportation Improvement Plan</p>
<p>First, the committee should immediately plan and implement a nationwide highway construction program. I believe that if this program is properly implemented, it will definitely greatly increase our country's economic strength at a lower cost within a few years. On this point, I want to remind this committee that there are currently more than one million Japanese prisoners of war in our country. Because of the lack of transportation and the various difficulties encountered by the Allied Supreme Commander in Japan, the repatriation of these prisoners of war must be implemented gradually. Before returning home, these prisoners of war should be allowed to do some productive work, thereby helping to restore some of the damage they have inflicted on our country. I firmly propose to this committee that before the Japanese prisoners of war return home, we should immediately use them to help our country build modern roads and build an entire transportation system.</p>
<p>Implement a Program to Improve Agriculture</p>
<p>Second, the committee should immediately plan a practical program to improve our country's agriculture and implement it. This plan should of course include increased production, import, and distribution of major fertilizers, pesticides, and improved seeds, as well as the dissemination of modern agricultural knowledge to farmers. The committee must also immediately find ways to reduce excessive land rent and usurious interest, and adjust land taxes to suit the people's ability to pay, in order to improve the living conditions of our country's farmers. To achieve these goals, the government has already established certain laws and regulations. The committee must be responsible for strengthening these laws and regulations, and urging their effective and rapid implementation. I further propose that the committee should plan a long-term afforestation program, so that the precious soil in our country's agricultural areas can be maintained and can supply the necessary timber. Afforestation on our country's barren mountains is indeed very important and should be started immediately.</p>
<p>Formulate Measures to Support Industry</p>
<p>Third, the committee should immediately formulate a plan to help various industries increase production, especially industries that produce various necessities, such as fuel, textiles, and building materials. To achieve this and other economic construction and development goals, the most urgent thing is to determine the exchange rate to stabilize the currency, which must be done as soon as possible. The committee must take immediate action on this point. To further encourage large-scale industrial production, the various controls imposed on industry by the government during the war should be lifted immediately, unless under certain circumstances, the lifting of controls would affect the entire national economy, which may be considered an exception. Direct and effective action should also be taken to facilitate the recruitment of qualified industrial management personnel, technical personnel, and skilled workers. Methods for importing industrial equipment based on our country's ability to pay should be supervised by the committee to ensure that the most important industries and public utilities can first obtain the funds and transportation needed to purchase these materials. The committee should guide the production of industry so that goods with a fixed market at home and abroad can be produced, and reduce unhealthy production. The interest rates and loan policies of our country's banks must be thoroughly reviewed and revised to encourage industrial production. The true situation of various industries operated by the Japanese during the war must be understood and analyzed. On this point, I can report that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has collected a lot of valuable information on the various economic activities of the Japanese in the occupied areas.</p>
<p>Find Ways to Encourage Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Fourth, the committee should find ways to encourage our country's foreign trade. This should be our main task. The committee should immediately formulate a plan to encourage and help produce various agricultural and industrial products needed abroad, of course, this production should not cause our country to lack other essential goods, and it cannot despise the deserved enjoyment of our laborers. By developing foreign trade, our country can obtain foreign exchange to purchase more necessary machinery and equipment and materials that cannot be produced domestically.</p>
<p>Fifth, the committee should concentrate its efforts on improving domestic health conditions. We must immediately determine policies and programs to plan the production, import, and development of various health and epidemic prevention equipment and facilities. Closely related to health programs are programs to improve housing, compulsory education, and other programs that are necessary to build a strong social foundation for people's economic activities.</p>
<p>Collect Information on Economic Plans</p>
<p>Sixth, the committee should immediately begin to collect detailed information from the government's various ministries, local agencies, and relevant groups and individuals on the economic plans for the next five years. Some of these plans should be implemented as soon as possible, and some can be promoted later. Our country is currently a poor country and cannot hope to achieve all the necessary reforms in a few years. The committee should be responsible for analyzing the facts about various economic plans and immediately give effective encouragement and help to the plans that are most valuable to the national economy. Among these plans, I advocate that special attention should be paid to the issue of river management, because river management is indeed one of our country's greatest resources. Sound river management methods can provide our country with urgently needed flood control methods, large irrigation projects, increased inland waterway transportation, cheap sources of electricity, and entertainment facilities urgently needed by the people within a few years. Through close cooperation between the central government and local governments, the committee will soon be able to complete and implement a comprehensive plan for economic construction and development. Under this plan, the people's most urgent needs will be addressed first. In summary, I hope that this committee can take action immediately. I hope that it can take action to strengthen our country's transportation, increase its agricultural and industrial production, develop its foreign trade, improve its health conditions, and make it work under a sound plan to seek economic progress.</p>
<p>Willing to Dedicate Ourselves to this Work so that People can Enjoy a Better Life</p>
<p>Our fellow countrymen now need and must have a realistic foundation of faith in the Principle of People's Livelihood. When the work of this committee bears fruit, the people will feel that they have gradually achieved a higher standard of living. In addition, they will also see that our country's prestige in the international community is increasing day by day. As long as there can be hope for domestic stability, I will do my best to achieve this stability. Then, the economic achievements of this committee will soon usher in a great era in our country's history.</p>
<p>Our people, after years of poverty and war, have won the right to enjoy a higher and better life. The members of this committee should find ways to make this better life a reality, not in the distant future, but in the near future. The duty of this committee is to work quickly and effectively to meet the needs of the people. Here and now, we jointly dedicate ourselves to this great work. (End)</p>
<h3>Editorial: Current Economic Policies - Reflections on Chairman's Instructions</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Supreme Economic Council held its first meeting in the Executive Yuan, with the Chairman personally attending and delivering instructions, solemnly outlining the complete picture of current economic policies. While we have not yet received the full text of the telegram as we write this after midnight, we can already glimpse the key points. In his instructions, the Chairman emphasized the restoration of production, the stability of people's lives, and the improvement of living standards. These are, in essence, the ideals that the people are seeking day and night. If the entire nation follows the Chairman's instructions and works together, these ideals can surely be realized.</p>
<p>The Founding Father (Sun Yat-sen) clearly stated long ago that the priority in nation-building is the people's livelihood. Therefore, the Chairman's instructions this time, right from the start, state that the purpose of establishing the Supreme Economic Council is to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. This shows that nation-building must begin with the economy. Confucius first emphasized "sufficient food," and Mencius lavishly spoke of "kingly way," even though the Confucianists who valued benevolence and righteousness and looked down on material gain, did not go beyond first ensuring adequate food and clothing before imparting education. Moreover, modern nations have entered an era of intense international economic competition. Whether a nation is based on agriculture, industry, or commerce, its focus cannot be separated from the economy. In discussing politics today, it is already intertwined with the economy. To ignore economic measures while hoping for political progress is almost impossible. After eight years of the War of Resistance, our country's strength has been exhausted, and production has been destroyed. Unless we rise up quickly and work hard to restore normalcy, we will not be able to survive, let alone build a nation. The Chairman's announcement that he is willing to take on the responsibility of guiding future economic measures shows his deep concern.</p>
<p>The main points of the Chairman's instructions are broad in scope. Speaking from the perspective of self-governance, it is about stabilizing people's livelihood and restoring vitality. Speaking from the perspective of its foundation, it is about cultivating agricultural and industrial manpower and improving living standards. In a nutshell, what the Chairman is constantly concerned about is how to enable the people to live in peace and enjoy a prosperous and abundant life. He is deeply concerned and planning how to enable the unemployed to regain employment. This spirit of "feeling the hunger and drowning of others as one's own" should move everyone to work together to promote economic policies and implement the Chairman's intentions.</p>
<p>The scope of the economy is vast, so it requires cooperation from all sectors. Economic measures require the right people, so it is necessary to start with rectifying officialdom. The power to rectify officialdom lies with those at the top.</p>
<p>The Chairman already deeply loathes the general trend of corruption, indulgence, selfishness, and self-interest. Therefore, in the future, verifying names and realities, and promoting integrity and eliminating corruption, will surely be swift and decisive, and will not betray the people's expectations. However, how to rescue the dying and heal the wounded, and strive for construction, so that the unemployed can return to work and the jobless can find jobs, is not the sole responsibility of the government. If the government strives to restore transportation and increase industrial and mining production, but some people destroy railways and damage coal mines to hinder the government's recovery work in the recovered areas, such insane actions should bear significant responsibility for the current suffering of the people's livelihood. The government has recently been working hard to correct this situation, and the people should also cooperate to restrain this evil force that obstructs construction, so that we can expect people's livelihood to become stable. The Chairman said, "Never before in history has such a great economic opportunity been unfolded before us." Indeed, we are facing this great economic opportunity. How to follow the instructions, support national policies, each fulfilling their duties, depends on our own choices.</p>

<h3>U.S. Occupation Authorities Transform Japanese Economic Institutions, Resulting in Pension System; Second Post-War Japanese Diet Convened Yesterday</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] As a result of the U.S. transformation of Japanese economic institutions, a pension system may emerge. According to Mr. Kramer, the Economic Chief of MacArthur's headquarters, although there is no definite plan at present, the Japanese government should take proper measures for the elderly who have no one to turn to. If the Japanese government designs a guarantee system, we will approve it and do our best to assist its development. Kramer made this statement during a discussion on the order to abolish military pensions, which he denounced as a "trick." According to his explanation, in the military pension system, regardless of age or physical condition, one can retire after three years of military service, and this pension accounts for 15% of the government's annual revenue.</p>

On August 22, 1939, before the attack on Poland, Hitler told senior German generals that we should be aware of Japan's shortcomings. I have given Japan a whole year to make a decision. The Japanese Emperor is like the late Russian Emperor; his weakness and incompetence may lead to his downfall before a revolution breaks out. In an earlier conversation, Hitler said that since the autumn of 1938, I have found that Japan is unwilling to unconditionally follow us, while Mussolini is intimidated by a cowardly monarch and a villainous prince. I have decided to unite with Stalin. In short, there are only three great statesmen: Stalin, that person, and Mussolini. The weakest of the three heroes is Mussolini. Only Stalin and I can predict the future by using force to break through the shackles of royalty or theocracy. In the same document, Hitler described Daladier and Chamberlain as "pathetic worms" who were unwilling to take any further steps beyond blockade. Another document concerning the Berlin meeting between Hitler and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka on April 4, 1941, reveals that Matsuoka repeatedly requested Hitler to provide Japan with new German naval and military inventions that Japan needed.</p>

<h3>"Mickey Mouse" Creator Re-creates Cartoons to Meet the Needs of the Peaceful Era</h3>
<p>[United Press Hollywood, 25th] Walt Disney, the creator of "Mickey Mouse," has been dedicated to producing war films in his modern studio for the past four years. Now he is returning to his old business, creating humorous cartoons to meet the needs of the peaceful era. The studio is a strange place. Although you won't see Betty Grable, there are hundreds of sounds, including duck quacks, parrot squawks, and earthworm cries. The stories of these artists are unknown to the outside world, so let's reveal one or two things. During the war, Disney devoted himself to producing military films, psychological warfare short films, and health and educational cartoons. He used more equipment and spent more time than other major Hollywood companies. "Mickey Mouse," "Donald Duck," and other cartoons have ten different language copies. Disney still provides the voice for Mickey Mouse himself. The duck language is created by Mr. Nash. His duck quacks are not limited to the three languages that Mr. Nash knows. Experts provide other languages with phonetic symbols. It is truly interesting to hear him quack in Portuguese or Greek. Mr. Nash likes to make animal sounds with milk carts to amuse the neighborhood children. This only stops when people from the studio come looking for the sound. Sometimes he makes horse sounds, which shock everyone. One day he tried it on the studio's broadcasting machine, and the meeting was disrupted and stopped countless times. It takes five or six months to complete a cartoon that is six or eight minutes long. Some cartoons, such as "The Three Caballeros," take two years to complete. Disney has a chemical laboratory to create special pigments with thousands of colors. Cartoon drawings are first outlined on large celluloid sheets. After being colored with this pigment, they can be photographed in the same way as color films. After that, films made by combining real scenes and cartoon characters will become increasingly popular. The new film "Make Mine Music," which is currently being produced in the studio, features the voices of Benny Goodman and the Andrews Sisters, but you don't see them. This is what the Disney people call "ghost actors."</p>

<h3>Our Garrison in Keelung Holds Mandarin Classes</h3>

<h3>City Elementary School Principals Hold Talks; Director Gu of the Education Bureau Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>[This City News] The City Education Bureau convened the first meeting of city elementary school principals at the bureau's auditorium at 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. More than 80 principals from urban and rural areas attended, and Director Gu, Chief Zhu of the National Education Department, and Chief Zhu of the Social Education Department also attended.</p>
<p>Taking Over City Elementary Schools</p>
<p>Director Gu delivered a speech, stating, "Minister of Education Zhu once said that education comes first during the period of national reconstruction. After the restoration of our city, we must start with national education to organize and improve. At present, there are 91 city elementary schools that have been taken over, which can accommodate about 35,000 students. However, even if the students from private schools are included, only more than 100,000 people can be accommodated. If there are 400,000 school-age children in the city, more than half of the children were not in education previously. It can be seen that we still need to make continuous efforts to popularize national education."</p>
<p>Working Hard to Restore Education</p>
<p>However, after the resumption of schools, school buildings were damaged, and desks and chairs were lacking, causing many difficulties. Due to the city government's financial constraints, it cannot provide as much assistance as possible. It is hoped that those in charge will actively work hard in difficult environments. The funds for the restoration of education in our city were personally promised by Minister Zhu for a loan of 20,000 yuan. If it is settled, it will be distributed equally among the elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Improving Teacher Treatment</p>
<p>As for the treatment of city school teachers, it has been approved by the city government that it will be handled in the same way as civil servants, with increased subsidies and rice allowances to stabilize their lives and enable them to work with peace of mind. Female teachers can be granted leave to rest during childbirth. In short, the Bureau is doing its best to plan for the welfare of teachers. The number of office supplies is small, so I hope that you can use them sparingly. If the drawing equipment is simple and lacking, you can ask enthusiastic people in the community to donate voluntarily, but you are not allowed to collect donations.</p>
<p>Assisting Private Schools to Develop</p>
<p>As for private elementary schools, as long as they aim to run schools, the Bureau is willing to cooperate and help them develop. This semester, 18 million yuan can be allocated as scholarships for private schools. I hope that educators will embrace the spirit of sacrifice and struggle to cultivate outstanding talents for the country." His words were sincere, and all the principals were inspired.</p>
<p>Monthly Talks</p>
<p>Then, the Section Chief of the National Education Department reported on the filling out of the teaching staff list, and some notes on rent, desks, and chairs, etc., and decided to hold principals' talks once a month to facilitate communication. Finally, it is planned to distribute a portion of this month's operating expenses to each school.</p>

<h3>Measures to Improve Teachers' Treatment; Chahar Provincial Department of Education Submits Application to the Ministry for Implementation</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency Chongqing Airmail] If we want education to be effective, we must rely on the continuous efforts of excellent teachers. If we want excellent teachers to be able to serve with peace of mind, we must allow them to</p>
<p>Reasons for Improvement</p>
<p>Be able to maintain a minimum standard of living. Before the war, the lives of ordinary teachers were already poor. Since the incident, prices have risen sharply, and teachers' salaries have not been able to keep up. Personal life has become a problem, let alone supporting their families. Given this situation, it is difficult to prevent them from seeking opportunities, and it is even harder to force them to work for the public. Moreover, because teachers cannot solve their livelihood problems, their bodies are in poor condition due to lack of adequate care, and their interests are reduced due to anxiety and depression. Therefore, the decline and regression of educational efficiency are inevitable. The Chahar Provincial Department of Education, in view of this, has specially formulated measures to improve teachers' treatment and submitted them to the Ministry of Education for unified implementation. The original measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Implementation Measures</p>
<p>(1) The treatment of teachers and staff in provincial elementary and secondary schools should be increased based on the price index to ensure that they can maintain a minimum standard of living. (2) The treatment of teachers and staff in municipal and private elementary and secondary schools should be ordered to the municipal and county governments or school boards to try their best to follow the example of provincial schools. (3) Teachers' salaries should be equal and uniform, regardless of whether they are public or private, with the same work and the same treatment. (4) In the provinces and cities that have been occupied, education has been destroyed, schools have been damaged beyond repair, and the people are extremely poor. Land tax has been exempted. Although an additional educational fund has been added, at the beginning of the restoration, school funds still need to be allocated by the government, and in order to improve teachers' treatment, the government should be asked to provide a large amount of subsidies.</p>

<h3>The Goal of National Taipei University</h3>
<p>— Luo Zonglu</p>
<p>The purpose of a university lies in the pursuit of truth and seeking the welfare of mankind. The systems of universities around the world may differ, but their ideals are the same, hence the saying "scholarship knows no borders." National Taipei University must assume this noble task in the future, and should not regard itself as merely a university of Taiwan, confined to a small scope. Know that if you aim for the highest standard, you will only achieve the middle; if you aim for the middle, you will only achieve the lowest. We can start from small things, but our goals must be lofty and far-reaching. Oxford University is located in Oxford, hence the name, but Oxford University is not merely a university of Oxford; it is a university of England, and also a university of the world. The same is true of Cambridge University. Although National Taipei University is named after Taipei, it is not merely a university of Taiwan, but a national university of China. We must strive to make it a university of the world. Running a university requires such lofty ideals. If it is run with a shortsighted vision and utilitarian thinking, it will never become a true university.</p>
<p>The predecessor of National Taipei University was the Japanese Taipei Imperial University, established twenty years ago (preparations began in 1925). Mr. Oshima Kintaro was the one who ran around and planned it. Mr. Oshima had lofty ideals. Although the justification for the preparations was to develop Taiwan's industry, his real goal was to create a complete temple of agricultural science. Although he unfortunately passed away early and was unable to fully realize his ambitions, the fact that the Faculty of Agriculture of Taipei Imperial University has such a scale is undoubtedly the result of his lofty ideals, which can serve as a lesson for us. I hope that our fellow compatriots in Taiwan will have a clear understanding of this point, and not regard this National Taipei University as merely a university of Taiwan, but broaden their horizons and work together to make National Taipei University a world-class academic institution, comparable to Oxford and Cambridge.</p>

<h3>Comforting the New Sixth Army</h3>
<p>The Chinese Harmonica Association, in view of the fact that the New Sixth Army has fought in various domestic battlefields and in northern Myanmar over the years, repeatedly defeating stubborn enemies, sent a delegation led by Wang Qingxun, the chairman of the association, to the 42nd Regiment of the 14th Division of the army to perform a comforting performance.

<h3>General Rockey Returns to Tianjin Tomorrow; Yesterday He Told Reporters That the Situation in North China is Serious; He Met Chairman Chiang in Chongqing for the First Time to Discuss Major Policies</h3>
<p>[Report from this City] General Rockey, Commander of the North American Marine Corps stationed in China, came to Shanghai from Chongqing the night before last with his Chief of Staff General Lawton, and is scheduled to return to Tianjin tomorrow (the 28th). When Mr. Rockey left Tianjin, he met with General Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Command, and his Chief of Staff Zhao Jiayi. However, the results of all plans and discussions do not seem to have reached the point of publication. When Mr. Rockey was in Chongqing, he went to see Chairman Chiang privately. He met with reporters in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and said: He went to Chongqing to meet Chairman Chiang for the first time to discuss major plans, and expressed his gratitude for the Chairman's kindness. He also said that Madam Chiang's health is not good and she intends to come to Shanghai to recuperate.</p>
<p>America is Determined to Save the Current Crisis</p>
<p>The situation in North China today is indeed serious, and seems to be worse than we expected. However, the US military will withdraw only after completing its mission. We will take action to save the current crisis. The US Marine Corps stationed in North China has a total of 50,000 people. Although most of them suffer from homesickness, he personally feels very happy with his work and is proud to assist the National Army in completing its mission. The Chinese government's request to the United States for ships to transport troops north has not yet received a definitive answer.</p>
<p>Communist Army Attacks Occur Daily</p>
<p>The US military's defense area in North China extends to Qinhuangdao. There are no US troops in the nine provinces of Northeast China. Most of the US troops are stationed in Tianjin, and they have been there for two months. They may stay in Tianjin for another two months to half a year. Everything depends on the development of the situation in North China and the orders of Washington. Because the number of troops stationed is huge, the supplies required are also large, and the transportation of materials is frequent. Moreover, supplies must be transported from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin and Beiping. Communist military harassment and attacks occur daily. The US military does everything possible to protect life and property. As for the so-called taking military action, it is not impossible, but there are concerns that innocent people will be affected. Most of the Japanese in North China have been disarmed, but some are still ordered to guard railways and assume defense responsibilities.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Key US Officials Stationed in Tianjin</p>
<p>Currently, the Marine Corps Headquarters in Tianjin has several people: (1) General Rockay, (2) General Peck, (3) General Shepherd, (4) General Woods, (5) General Johnson, (6) General Snow. In Beiping, there is General Jones. They fought in various places during the war and were transferred to North China this autumn. Mr. Rockey never expressed his views on the future movements of the US Marine Corps in North China, but it is known that the US Marine Corps will never withdraw from this complex environment, because the US military's mission is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Gold Price Plunges 40,000 Amidst Speculation</h3>
<p>There is a rumor of an 80% Discount on US Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 26th), the financial market turned sluggish because Chairman Chiang was about to deliver a speech on economic policies. However, there was no shortage of short covering after the decline. In addition, there was much speculation in the market about the official exchange rate, and no one could agree. After the decline, the market turned hesitant. The domestic gold market reported a slight decline. After the opening, the price broke through the 800,000 mark and gradually fell to around 760,000. The afternoon session closed with a surge in short covering, which pulled the price up, once returning to 790,000. In the afternoon, it hovered within 780,000. As a result, it fell back 40,000 compared with last Saturday. People generally have deep expectations for Chairman Chiang to suppress prices and stabilize the currency value. However, there are different opinions on the negotiation of US dollar exchange rates. It is unknown whether the gold price will be lowered to match the US dollar, or the US dollar will be raised to match the gold purchase price. However, calculated at a US dollar price of 1,300, the gold price is still too high. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops was 84,000, which was also 3,000 lower than last Saturday. The official price of silver was unchanged at 650 yuan per tael. Therefore, the price of silver dollars lacked momentum to rise and continued to hover around 430.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars fell as soon as the gold market fell, initially retreating to 1,320 yuan, and then breaking into the 1,300 mark. There was a rumor in the market that the official US dollar exchange rate would be 20% lower than the black market, and it once fell to 1,280 yuan. Afterwards, it hovered around 1,300 due to the rebound of the gold price. As a result, it fell back 30 yuan compared with last Saturday. The same was true for Hong Kong dollars. Although there were rumors of a devaluation of the pound sterling, the Hong Kong US dollar exchange rate fell to 5.00 yuan. The two statements offset each other, so although it fell, it was still flat. As a result, old Hong Kong dollars fell by 25 yuan, new goods fell by 3 yuan, Hankou pounds were 3,100, and rupees were 280, all of which were purchase prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bonds market saw a concentration of general floating funds because the stock market could not be publicly traded. In addition, large investors were watching the gold market and also came to participate, resulting in a situation where demand exceeded supply. The price of each bond rose by 20 to 50 yuan. People generally have various extravagant hopes for the future repayment of principal on public bonds. The market continued to rise after the close and the market was particularly brisk. Hua shares have already been sold for liquidity. Yesterday, they were further discouraged by personnel from the Securities Building, making trading even more inconvenient. Off-market bidding was intermittent. As a result, large-cap stocks were still flat compared to last Saturday, while small-cap stocks fell by nearly 10%. This was because retail investors were scrambling to close their positions, resulting in this situation.</p>
<p>Due to various inconveniences, off-market trading of foreign stocks also showed signs of disappearing. Except for Jardine Matheson Textile Mill, which was noticed at around 1,400 to 1,500, no one consulted on the rest.</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Using American Cotton (Small)</h3>
<p>Cotton is spun into yarn, yarn is woven into cloth. The process seems very simple. But where does the cotton come from? Can the 5,000 bales brought by the Victory supply the operation of 200,000 spindles in large and small yarn factories throughout the city?</p>
<p>In the past, cotton merchants could exchange five dan of cotton for one piece of yarn from the yarn factory. Gradually, it went from five dan to seven dan, and then to seven and a half dan, and even eleven dan for one piece. The trading conditions of the yarn factory seemed to be gradually gaining an advantage. Has the supply of foreign cotton created this advantage?</p>
<p>Shaanxi cotton has not come to Shanghai for a long time. The prospect of Tongzhou cotton is very dim under the recent situation. The varieties of local cotton are mixed and of low quality. Under the premise of accelerating production, the supply and replenishment of domestic raw materials have become a major problem, and we can only rely on foreign cotton. This loophole, whether large or small, is ultimately not the fundamental way to build the country.</p>
<p>Purchasing foreign cotton requires foreign exchange funds. I absolutely support foreign exchange management, but I also advocate production management. In the stage of nation-building, the people should live frugally and it seems unnecessary to use a substantial amount of foreign exchange to purchase expensive raw materials to meet the "urgent needs" of the market.</p>
<p>It is said that the cost of American cotton is only two-thirds of that of domestic cotton, so using American cotton is tantamount to helping the government suppress prices. However, the highest principle of using foreign exchange is to be able to obtain more foreign exchange as a result. If the only goal is to suppress prices, the price seems too high.</p>
<p>Cotton is the main raw material for yarn and cloth. Our country does not lack planting land, so why not think about improving farming and smoothing transportation?</p>
<p>It is said that there are a total of 18,000 looms in Shanghai, and the daily output can reach 36,000 bolts. This means that each person consumes at least 1,000 pieces. So far, there are only 200,000 spindles in operation. The daily output is 500 pieces. Even if it can all be supplied for commercial use, only half of the looms can be operated.</p>
<p>It is also said that there are a total of 1,400 pairs of dyeing vats in Shanghai, and they can produce a total of 140,000 bolts of colored cloth per day. Assuming that all the looms are currently operating and all are supplied for processing, only a quarter can be supplied. What's more, the raw materials for weaving are experiencing problems.</p>
<p>Based on the above two points, it can be seen that the distribution and establishment of our country's enterprises have never been planned in a comprehensive way. Further on: it can be seen that the source of raw materials for most of the state-owned industries has always relied on foreign goods.</p>
<p>Yarn and cloth are the source of clothing for the people. Planned economy is the key to building the country in the future. In this regard, it seems necessary to have planned planning.</p>
<h3>New Candidates for Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Wu Zhen and seven other related businesses jointly initiated the Shanghai Chemical Raw Material Manufacturing Trade Association. The governing authority, considering its nature to be the same as the chemical raw material industry, ordered it to merge into the chemical raw material trade association.</p>
<p>Wu Shisen and others initiated the Chinese Stock Trade Association, which was also ordered by the governing authority to merge into the Securities Trade Association.</p>
<p>Wang Hefu and others initiated the Match Industry Trade Association, Shen Anqing initiated the Native Tobacco Industry Trade Association, and Deng Meide and others initiated the Auto Parts Assembly and Distribution Trade Association, all of which have been approved by the government.</p>
<p>Xu Zhonghe was additionally appointed as a member of the reorganization committee of the National Goods Rubber Products Trade Association.</p>
<p>Zhang Yiqin, Wang Qinglai, and Zhang Chun were appointed as members of the reorganization committee of the Funeral Supplies and Stationery Trade Association.</p>
<p>Dai Shilun, a member of the Tea Industry Reorganization Committee, resigned and was replaced by Huang Yantang.</p>
<p>Lu Ou, a member of the Fruit and Native Goods Industry Reorganization Committee, was dismissed and replaced by Zhang Shouren.</p>
<p>Zhi Rongsan was appointed as a member of the reorganization committee of the Rickshaw Trade Association.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Market Situation</h3>
<p>Rice Market: Yesterday, rice sellers were very firm. Retailers' demand was normal, so there was no power to rise. High-quality goods remained stable, while medium and lower-quality goods rose slightly by 200-300 yuan. The situation was firm in the morning and stable in the afternoon. Glutinous rice rose slightly by 100-200 yuan. Flour was sluggish, continuing to decline by nearly 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Oil Cakes: Due to the continuous arrival of goods from Qingdao, oil prices fell. Retail sales were weak. Raw oil and soybean oil fell again by about 1,000 yuan. Clear oil and rapeseed oil remained stable. Soybean cakes were actively sold due to shipments to Taiwan for use as fertilizer.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Beans and Explosives: Both arrivals and sales of soybeans were scarce. However, several oil factories have started operating, which is related to raw materials. The market trend is temporarily stable.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn and Cloth: The yarn market was weak in price and sales, and there was still no improvement. Although various trading groups had demand, the factory's tax payment procedures were troublesome and time-consuming, so the merchant groups took a wait-and-see attitude. Currently, the yarn factories intend to sell and buy American cotton, but due to the lack of outlets, the yarn price seems to lack progress. Merchant groups and dyeing factories had poor demand for fine cloth, but there was some trading on the street. Prices were stable and weak. Well-known brands of shilin cloth and other colored cloths sold well. Bleached cloth had a solid and stable market price due to thin inventories and some retail sales.</p>
<p>Coal Market: People's hearts are still idle, and importers are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. Except for high-end goods, which are still being supported by the holders, the rest continue to show a weak trend. The other day, another American ship arrived, loaded with 8,700 tons of Kailan Special Grade Eight coal from Qinhuangdao, allocated for the use of the electricity company. Unloading began yesterday. The firewood and charcoal market was very calm. Various routes in eastern Zhejiang continued to have arrivals. Traders absorbed at low prices, and the price was not much changed from before.</p>
<p>Hardware: The market is quite idle, and the market situation of various goods is weak on the inside despite a strong showing on the outside. Those holding goods mostly take a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to sell at lower prices, while the raw materials stored in the factories are still sufficient to cope with the time, and there is no intention to purchase. Therefore, transactions are weak, and the price of goods is difficult to improve in a short time.</p>
<p>North and South Goods: The market is stable and weak because arrivals from various routes are very scarce and actual sales are sluggish, also due to weak purchasing power. Moreover, transportation is not smooth, and prices are still in turmoil, but the increase has been fierce, so it is unlikely to rise again.</p>
<p>Dyes: Yesterday's dye market was weak in sales, so prices tended to decline, and retail sales were also sluggish.</p>
<p>Tea Market: Yesterday, people's hearts still showed a firm intention. There was a continuous flow of sales, and buyers had strong demand. The market rose from sluggish to high. As a result, the prices were reported to have risen across the board compared to last week. High-quality Qimen tea jumped to 32,500 yuan per dan, and medium-quality Shuangxun tea rose more than 10,000 yuan compared to last week, breaking the 100,000 yuan mark per dan. Other varieties were also considered popular.</p>
<h3>New Post-War Enterprises: Two Peppermint Oil Factories</h3>
<p>The production of peppermint oil is one of the emerging enterprises in recent years. The future is especially bright after the victory of the War of Resistance. It is recently learned that local tycoon Xu Jiqing and others have initiated the organization of a peppermint oil refining factory with a capital of 20 million National Currency. The full amount was raised by the initiators and no more shares will be offered to the public. It is named Fuhua Peppermint Oil Refining Factory Co., Ltd., specializing in refining and sales, and also operating its related subsidiary businesses. In addition to Xu, it is also heard that someone else is organizing this factory, and the work has already begun.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Huafeng Wheel returned to Shanghai from Ningbo, carrying 121 bales of Yuyao flowers.</p>
<p>Coal briquette businesses are requesting the Fuel Management Committee to supply coal dust to increase raw materials.</p>
<p>50,000 bags of flour and 1,760 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Keelung today as relief supplies from the Relief Administration for Taiwan.</p>
<p>The "Reorganization of Book Capital Amount" manuscript published yesterday was temporarily suspended due to limited space and will be continued.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Passengers Clinging to Trolleys</h3>
<p>Trolleys in this city are crowded with passengers, causing some passengers to cling to the trolley doors, hanging outside the car, or riding on the rear of the trailer, which is not only dangerous to themselves but also violates traffic rules. It is learned that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has already informed the Municipal Police Bureau and the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police to strictly crack down on this. It has also ordered the trolley company to comply.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Surplus Materials to Be Sold at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The U.S. authorities will establish an Overseas Liquidation Affairs Office in Shanghai on December 1, responsible for selling huge amounts of U.S. military surplus materials according to U.S. government instructions. The office is expected to be headed by General Johnson. It is reported that U.S. surplus materials include aircraft, trucks, building materials, medicines, clothing, food, etc. It is generally estimated that the value of the surplus goods is over 300 million U.S. dollars. According to a report from this newspaper's reporter, all the materials to be sold in Shanghai, except for those belonging to the Navy which are still en route, have been concentrated in Shanghai. Part of them will be sold at a fair price to local private institutions, but according to the measures set by the U.S. government, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Chinese government agencies, and various charitable organizations will have the right to purchase with priority. The office has not yet received official instructions regarding the application procedures for the sale.</p>

<h3>The People's Intelligence Has Been Opened</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>The storm of the War of Resistance opened the door to the Chinese people's intelligence!</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the general education level of the Chinese people is backward. Regarding national affairs and the world situation, the Chinese people in the past mostly adopted an attitude of indifference because they could not manage, dared not manage, and could not manage. Since the War of Resistance, this attitude has changed greatly. Because of the close relationship between personal interests and life and death, everyone has to care about current affairs and the world situation, so the people's intelligence has been greatly opened. Because of the war, the general public has increased a lot of knowledge about the geography of China and the world. Many place names that have never been heard before have appeared in newspapers and in the mouths of children. Everyone has also gradually become familiar with the historical facts of World War I and the League of Nations.</p>
<p>This fact is especially evident in Chongqing, the wartime capital of China during the War of Resistance. We can often see rickshaw pullers reading newspapers, and illiterate sedan chairmen and maids talking to you about national affairs. These were rarely seen in the past, but now they have gradually become popular.</p>
<p>I think the War of Resistance has at least opened the people's intelligence two years earlier.</p>
<p>Another major gain of China's War of Resistance, I believe, is the progress of the people's intelligence.</p>

<h3>The Latin Quarter of Paris After the War</h3>
<p>— Shen Yikun</p>
<p>The Latin Quarter of Paris has been the wandering center for students from all over the world since the 13th century. Today, it makes the French government feel a headache.</p>
<p>Thousands of ragged students are wandering the streets under the shadow of the University of Paris, looking for houses and books. Many of them have returned from German concentration camps.</p>
<p>The small hotels crowded in the winding streets of the Latin Quarter have shrewd owners who know that renting rooms to passing couples can earn more money than renting to students. Therefore, the Ministry of Education had to requisition hotels that had been conscripted from returning prisoners of war last spring. Many hotels are miles away from the university.</p>
<p>Other hotels in the Latin Quarter are occupied by the American Red Cross and the Allied forces. An official said: "We may have to build barracks for these students."</p>
<p>The number of students registered at the University of Paris this year is higher than in any year since 1930. But the cost of living for students has increased four or five times. Due to the lack of paper, there is a great shortage of books. Food is also quite difficult to obtain. The Ministry of Education has set up cheap canteens where students can eat a simple meal for a few francs. But there is a fear of freezing this winter.</p>
<p>The cafes on the sloping sidewalks around the Panthéon are sparsely seated. The great French writers Voltaire and Zola were both in the Panthéon.</p>
<p>A twenty-seven-year-old student said: "The price of beer is four times more expensive than before the war, and there is no good wine now." He was a prisoner of war for five years and is now starting his university career again.</p>
<p>The most significant change in this past most pleasant place in Paris is a large sign next to the famous Cluny Museum that reads: "Students! Do not forget the classmates in the sanatorium. Please donate to the National Student Sanatorium Association." Many young French people have returned from Germany in such poor health that they cannot go to school.</p>
<p>French universities receive an average of one hundred letters a week from Americans asking to study there. But because accommodation is difficult, I am afraid that no Americans will be able to come, but several hundred American soldiers will attend lectures at the university.</p>
<p>Academics</p>
<h3>Starting From Lectures</h3>
<p>— Jinjiang</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, when various forms of lectures were booming in this city, a certain bank used the form of a school to hold a business lecture. At that time, it was a unique undertaking in the society.</p>
<p>In order to make many people interested in commerce, anyone who volunteered to participate was accepted regardless of the age and level of the students. As a result, for the above reasons, the lecturers found it difficult to teach; also for this reason, most students could not develop a good impression. The result was that the number of students decreased from 450 to 50!</p>
<p>These fifty students who really came to learn included bank employees, students, bosses, engineers, apprentices, and counter friends in grocery stores. From the age point of view, it ranged from sixteen to forty years old. In terms of level, some had graduated from elementary school, some were in the second year of college. It is really difficult to find a line of results from such complex molecules to hold lectures! And at the end, these fifty people were still playing this scene. There was no result to taste.</p>
<p>Does China not need the form of lectures to elaborate on academics? No, definitely not, it's just that there are too few needed.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about Mr. Yu Tao’s speech at the Youth Association last month. A famous university sponsored it, and the topic was novel and interesting. At first, as many as 700 people asked for tickets to attend, and even more people wanted to go but could not get tickets. The grand occasion should be unprecedented! But, no, when the meeting started, there were only about 300 people present, not to mention those who left halfway. From this, it can be seen that holding academic lectures in China is really a difficult task to please. (Some people say: It's still more interesting to listen to storytellers!)</p>
<p>Based on our experience: Isn't night school the same? Isn't cram school the same? Therefore, the work of eliminating illiteracy in the future should start from complete elementary schools, starting with school-age children!</p>

<h3>Traces of Cytotoxins</h3>
<p>— Shou Zhe</p>
<p>Recently, in a certain scientific association in Moscow, Soviet scientist Peter Bezhensky reported his newly discovered cytotoxins and the amazing effects obtained in the experiment.</p>
<p>According to Peter Bezhensky's experimental results, the application of cytotoxins can make cows produce more milk, make chickens lay more eggs, and increase the productivity of other animals. Cytotoxins are a type of toxin that is naturally formed in the blood serum. There are many types of toxins, each specifically attacking an organ or a part of the fat tissue. For example, there are kidney cytotoxins, liver cytotoxins, etc. The function of each is now under study.</p>
<p>Peter Bezhensky applied a small amount of a certain cytotoxin and was able to increase the amount of milk produced by cows by 65%. When applied to chickens, it can make chickens that do not lay eggs lay eggs, and make the production of chickens that lay eggs suddenly increase. Horses that have been infertile have actually produced foals after applying maternal hormones. Piglets that have been born for ten weeks have an average weight that is 20% heavier than that of ordinary pigs after being given toxins for seven months.</p>
<p>Animals do not have any adverse reactions after applying a small amount of cytotoxins. Each time, only a certain part of the organ is stimulated and appears to be slightly enlarged.</p>

<p>Municipal Administration</p>
<h3>Waste Cannot Be Used</h3>
<p>— Lin Bao</p>
<p>Not long ago, I met a municipal expert who had returned from studying abroad. He sighed and said that even Chinese garbage is not as good as foreign garbage. Everyone felt strange, thinking that this was another first-class figure who thought that the foreign moon was rounder than the Chinese picture. Later, after asking about the cause, I realized that this was a fact.</p>
<p>He said that a few years ago, the Shanghai Municipal Council spent a lot of money to build a large house at No. 2 Binlang Road, with various garbage incineration equipment inside, preparing to burn garbage like large cities abroad. This combines hygiene principles and can also obtain many useful by-products. This method is called garbage disposal. Foreign countries have been using it since 1890. The garbage is placed in a tightly closed pipe and heated with steam. At the same time, a machine is used to stir the garbage being heated to decompose the garbage into water vapor, oil, and solid nitrogen-containing substances. Oil can be used to make soap, and solids can be used to fertilize the fields. It can be said to be a multiple win.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council tried it in Shanghai for a very short period of time, but it failed unexpectedly. The reason for the failure is that China is too poor, so even Chinese garbage is not as good as foreign garbage. Because Shanghai's garbage has been picked through several times by poor children, and items such as rotten cloth and waste paper have been removed, the remaining items are often useless broken glass or broken iron lumps, which cannot be burned, let alone oil and Solids containing 　, these kinds of valuable by-products. In order to save coal, the Municipal Council had to close the house that was prepared to burn garbage. Therefore, Chinese waste cannot be used.</p>
<p>Now this large house with a tall chimney towering on the bank of the Suzhou River has been converted into the Shanghai Factory Union Hospital, which is also a waste of resources.</p>

<h3>Wireless Iron</h3>
<p>— Chong Mei</p>
<p>The iron is dragged by an electric wire behind it, and it is always inconvenient to iron clothes. Wireless irons have now been invented, and the American Orika Vacuum Cleaner Company is supplying them. Daozhong iron also has a safety thermostat seat. The iron only needs to be placed on it to heat up, and the level of heat can be determined according to the nature of the ironing things, and can be adjusted at will.</p>

<h3>The Enemy (6)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>Hana asked: "Are you saying he will die during the operation?"</p>
<p>Sadão said: "Yes."</p>
<p>Hana thought with some suspicion. Before she could answer, Sadão had turned away. He said, "We have to think of a way anyway. The first thing is to wash him." He walked out quickly, and Hana followed him. She didn't want to be left alone with this white man. Since she left America, he was the first white man she had seen. He seemed completely different from the white people she had seen in America. Whether he was dead or alive here, he was always her enemy, making her feel threatened.</p>
<p>She turned to the nursery and called out, "Yumi!"</p>
<p>But the children heard her voice, so she had to go in for a while, smile at them, and play with the little baby boy who was nearly three months old.</p>
<p>Leaning over the baby's soft black hair, she pouted and said, "Yumi, come with me!"</p>
<p>Yumi replied: "I have to make sure the baby is settled first. He's going to sleep."</p>
<p>She and Yumi walked into the bedroom next to the nursery. She stood holding the baby, and Yumi spread the bedding on the floor, and then put the baby down to sleep well.</p>
<p>Hana quickly led her softly to the kitchen. The two servants in the kitchen had heard what the master had told them and were very frightened. The old gardener tugged at the few mustaches on his lips.</p>
<p>He said frankly to Hana, "The master shouldn't heal this white man's wounds. This man is destined to die. He was shot first. Later, the sea caught him, and the rocks in the sea injured him. If the master heals the injuries caused by the gun and the sea, they will come to take revenge on us."</p>
<p>Hana respectfully said: "I will tell him what you said." Although she was not as superstitious as the old man, she was also very afraid. Would helping the enemy be a good thing? But she finally told Yumi to bring hot water to the room where the white man was lying.</p>
<p>She walked ahead and opened the door between the two rooms. Sadão hadn't come yet. Yumi, who was following behind, put down her wooden bucket of water. She approached the white man. As soon as she saw the man, her thick lips closed stubbornly. She said, "I have never washed a white man. Now I don't want to wash such a white man."</p>
<p>Hana said sternly to her, "You have to listen to your master's orders!"</p>
<p>Yumi stubbornly said, "My master shouldn't order me to wash an enemy."</p>
<p>There was a very fierce resistance on Yumi's dull round face, which made Hana afraid for no reason. What if the servants reported some fabricated facts?</p>
<p>She said solemnly: "Very well. You should know that we just want to wake him up so that we can hand him over as a prisoner."</p>
<p>Yumi said, "I don't want to have anything to do with this. I am a poor person. This is not my business."</p>
<p>Hana said gently, "Then please go back to your own work."</p>
<p>Yumi left immediately. This left Hana alone with the white man. If Yumi's stubbornness hadn't aroused her anger, she might not have dared to stay there.</p>
<p>She muttered fiercely, "Stupid Yumi, isn't he a person, an injured and helpless person?"</p>
<h3>Freedom, Freedom</h3>
<p>— Shen Yin</p>
<p>Freedom itself has always been dangerous, but we must be safest only when we have freedom. —— Fosdick</p>
<p>Political freedom cannot give us freedom. We must first make our thoughts free. —— Tagore</p>
<p>Freedom is a fleeting, difficult-to-hold thing. —— Smith</p>
<p>Freedom is like property. If you want it to fulfill its function, you must be careful to use it. —— McDonald</p>
<p>Maintaining a free life is a difficult art. —— Jefferson</p>
<p>Social Services: Urgent Need for Implementation in Recovered Areas; Reviving the Moral Movement</p>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Loyal and Steadfast Should Be Commended</p>
<p>Eliminate the Dregs and Scoundrels Thoroughly</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, our country's eight-year War of Resistance, with full mobilization and unity from top to bottom, finally achieved the final victory. Now, reflecting on the pain, the sacrifices have been enormous, but it was worth it! However, people generally only pay attention to material reports and neglect the spiritual and psychological losses. Material things are tangible, so they are easy to detect; spiritual things are intangible, so they are naturally not easy to detect. However, in terms of importance, material and spiritual things are equally important. What is the spiritual loss? That is "moral degradation." In an independent and free country, people live together in a healthy society. If people have no moral compass, what kind of society would that be? Even with material civilization, it will inevitably end in bankruptcy. The principle is clear and cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Let's not even talk about the free areas of the past eight years, but especially in the occupied areas, especially metropolises like Shanghai, everyone shouts: "People's hearts are bankrupt, it's not a society!" Apart from a few who were steadfast in their loyalty, unyielding in the face of power, and secondly those who were law-abiding and maintained integrity, the actions of the general public were truly extremely vile. For example: (1) currying favor with the powerful and oppressing the weak; (2) speculative merchants, valuing profit over righteousness; (3) defrauding and extorting wealth, with little shame; (4) making trouble unreasonably, creating disputes; the most hateful are those who colluded with the enemy and puppets, selling out the country for personal gain; judging their actions, their crimes are unforgivable! We propose that the first type of people above should be commended by the central government (according to the Political Department of the Third War Area, this is currently under investigation), and the worst types should be investigated and punished thoroughly in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. If we indulge and forgive national scum, society will never be peaceful, and the country will find it difficult to get on the right track of the rule of law.</p>
<p>This column takes the lead in launching the "Reviving the Moral Movement," sweeping away the haze of the past where black and white were indistinguishable, and right and wrong were confused, welcoming the righteous spirit of heaven and earth, and returning to the path of light, and hoping that the government will formulate a "National Covenant" based on the New Life Movement so that the public has something to follow, only then can we talk about reviving morality. We hope that all readers will rise up and promote this movement. Society will be fortunate (Readers are welcome to send letters expressing their opinions, which will be published if appropriate).</p>
<h3>On Behalf of Sending Out Free Medical Consultation and Medicine Vouchers</h3>
<p>Mr. Ye Ziyun of the New China Hospital writes: "Our hospital has been providing free medical consultations and medicine, charging only the lowest registration fee, which is always less than half the cost of the medicine. Since the War of Resistance, the lives of the poor and sick have become even more difficult. Our hospital has specially issued a type of completely free medical consultation voucher, which entitles the holder to free medicine. We have long admired your newspaper's service to society and enthusiasm for public welfare, and on the occasion of its resumption of publication, we are sending 200 of our hospital's medical consultation vouchers for this year, please send them to the poor and sick. After they are used up, please send us a letter so that we can send more. Other newspapers or charitable organizations who are willing to distribute them can also write to us to request them." (Hospital address—215 Ma Bai Road)</p>
<h3>Public National Martial Arts Class Enrollment</h3>
