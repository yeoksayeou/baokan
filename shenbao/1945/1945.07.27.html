<p>昭南二十六日中央社電二十五日上午八時許，敵美巡洋艦二艘，接近馬來半島中部西岸檳榔　西北方三百公里之泰領浦開特島，實施艦砲射擊後，敵軍約五百名分　登陸用舟艇五艘，於該島西北端之麥考附近登陸，日守備部隊即猛烈加以反擊，予以極大損害，終將敵擊退於洋上，敵主力其後仍於浦開特島東南方海而游弋，以艦砲射　及空軍之轟炸攻擊附近機塲，然敵軍兵力極爲薄弱，輸送船僅六艘左右，此次登陸企圖，當不出偵察威力之範　。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電浦開特島位於檳榔嶼烏西北三百公里之泰國浦開特州內，全島束西約三十公里，南北約五十公里，該鳥爲一豐富之錫　姿源地帶，泰國年產錫五萬噸，　島所產即佔十分之八，以前採鑛事業，係用英國資本，而由華僑經營，鑛石則運往檳榔　烏，敵此次進攻該島，係策應婆羅洲峇厘巴板油田地帶之作戰，企岡南方重要資源以對日戰爭。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地二十六日中央社電北婆羅洲密利方面之敵，仍配置其主力於洛敦地區（密利北方二十公里），隨時分調少數兵力，侵人日軍守備綫，以擴大地盤。二十三日敵以登陸用　艇數艘，　航巴拉河支流，企圖於阿蘭登陸，該地日軍邀擊敵軍，僅二十分鐘即將敵擊退。又敵亟欲使用密利飛機塲，最近似已開始使用。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日特攻機隊活躍隨時採取奇襲戰　已控制必勝之空中劇戰 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電邇來敵軍企圖登陸，當臨近日本本土時，日方屢以特攻隊迎頭痛擊，因距離愈近，則日方特攻隊之活動愈益有利，而其他航空部隊之活動，亦皆趨異常有利。冲繩距離日本土固有七八百海里之遙，然此次企圖準備登陸之敵，料未必由如此之遠地，竟行登陸作戰，前此以艦砲攻　本土之敵艦船團，就其射程　，僅可進至距本土三四十哩附近海而而已其航空母艦所　飛機之行動範團，想亦在二百至五百哩之間，至軍隊運輸船，雖然距　較遠，惟登陸舟　之行動迅速，其位置距離當亦匪遙也。同時，敵單並廣布電波探知網，戰鬥機亦增强其防空砲火之防　設施，故無論距　如何，已　無遙遠之可言，蓋此次戰爭，亦即陸上基地與空母基　之戰爭，日軍乃處於絕對有利之地位，自可控制絕對有必勝把握之空中劇戰。同時特攻隊亦必能充分發揮活潑機能，因距離迫近，則必使敵軍恃爲利器之電波探知機功效減低，日機飛出，雖經敵電波採知正確，測定位置後，若有三十分至一小時之餘裕時間，又當別諭，然距離極近，敵機欲上昇時，而特攻機已於敵上空採取進攻態勢，其迅速間不容髮，故無論敵軍如何迅速測出日機之動向，其戰鬥機亦不能立即出發，因此，敵軍爲防禦日特攻隊之進攻，乃必須於全日之二十四小時內，以相當多　之戰鬥機，　旋空際，　負哨之任務也。　日軍不僅派遺特攻隊，同時復輔以戰鬥機作戰，其勢實不假敵軍以半分半秒之空餘時間，雖進攻之敵即使擁有與空軍同等之機數。惟在實際上並非如此簡便，若其空軍基地係在陸上，又當別論。然敵機之升降，皆在海上航空母艦之甲板上，且當升降時，該航空母艦又不能以全速力進行，飛機之燃料發生問題，自不待言，即航空母艦之燃料消費量，亦與平時逈異，加以天氣劇　及夜間往往多出意外事故。反之，日軍即使於夜問亦能突行攻擊，而對於海空上航術，尤特有把握，並能隨時施行奇　，且機載之炸彈又較以前冲繩戰時更巨且多，他如由航空母艦向船團艦　輸送登陸用之舟　時，亦完全暴費於日特攻隊之前，因是須配備相當航空母艦陣，以爲掩護。此外，尙須有　料管整備等設備，而其登陸地點及目標，因已爲固定不移，故無論何稱機動部隊，亦不能隨意自行移動，均不能逃避日特攻機之襲擊，此乃敵軍之致命傷也。</p>

<p>東京二十六日中央社電急於早期對日決戰之美國，隨太平洋戰局之轉移，爲增强兵力及軍需炎材，刻謀銳意擴充陸海輸送力，自上月以來，此種傾向尤爲　著，太平洋艦隊司令官尼米資，當此次機動部隊出擊時，曾作壯語謂：「太平洋戰局，業臨於即將登陸之附段」，由此各種情勢而觀，日，美兩方各以全力展開之大決戰，其時期當在不久矣。茲探悉美陸海輸送力之現狀如次：　在歐兵員資材之撤退狀况，據言歐戰告終，當時歐洲戰綫之美軍總兵力，計約三百七十萬名，其中五十萬則決留駐歐洲，除一部約一二百萬歸還其其本國復員外，其餘則轉調於太平洋戰錢各地，由歐陸運輸如此龐大兵員，須橫農長遠距離之海道，始抵達太平洋戰綫，若再考慮輸送軍需資材及由本國補給新軍需品，則美國海運前途之困難極多，就吾人回憶前次歐戰終了　，美方於歐陸撤退兵員，曾費時一年有餘之前例，即可想知。頃據歐洲侵攻軍輸運司令部發表，對德戰爭結東以來，迄六月末止，美兵撒回總數，計達三十一萬，乃至現在止，已撤還之兵員，僅五十七萬三千名，與美輸運司令部嚴初發表，欲期於兩月內撤回七十四萬之目標未達，即可見其輪運力之困難。　本國鐵道運一輸狀况，美陸軍部會聲明謂，輸送每一師團之資材，必需貨物列車達數十輛以上，如以前向英國輸送軍隊之列軍數，每日竟達一千五百輛之多，而現在向太平洋戰域之兵員及資材數量，實遠在昔日運往英國時之上，且歐洲登陸作戰曾有兩年以上之準備時間，反之，此次之緊急輸送，僅預定三個月完成，是以將運輸軍需汽車七千五百輛以上改爲專自輸送軍隊之用。美國府更爲應付緊急事能計，由去年起即努力增產車輛，力謀增强陸運能力，今後其軍輛不足問題，能否稍形緩和，實屬疑問，而戰路輸送之困難，除列市不足外，即爲鐵路從業員缺乏問題，此種情勢，西部各州尤甚。美總統特魯曼曾謂，如不謀速加補充新從業員六萬五千名，則太平洋戰綫之補給影嚮，將遭遇相當阻碍。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c5">敵美的焦燥與日本的堅定 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>上幾天本埠接連遭受敵機盲目轟炸，這是一種神經戰的戰略，同時也是敵美對於戰爭感覺焦燥的表現。</p>
<p>敵美希望對日作戰能夠趕快結束，第一因爲戰爭愈拖長，軍隊的犧牲，物姿的消耗必愈多，敵美雖自恃物量豐富，而人的姿源却不願多數喪失，所以切盼戰爭能够早日結束，第二自從歐戰結束之後，敵美國民的戰意顯然露出鬆懈的狀熊，所以負責太平洋作戰的將領不能不若急起來，第三蘇聯現在已在休養生息，復員的工作，生產的事業都在逐步開始，而敵美還無暇及此，假如對日戰爭再延長下去，勢必影響將來國際勢力的均衡。</p>
<p>所以敵美一面散佈各種謠言，作謀略的試探，一面竭力想把蘇聯牽入對日作戰漩渦，舊金山會議　的活動與宋子文的訪問莫斯科，都是由於這種動機所驅使的。而共策略之最惡劣者，就是想用連續盲目轟炸的辦法，來壓倒日本旺盛的戰意。</p>
<p>敵美犧牲了多數的軍隊與艦船而侵入冲繩島之後，雖然高唱在巾國沿岸登陸與攻擊日本本土的口號，然而冲繩苦鬥的經騐使他們不敢輕於嘗試，幷且事實上因爲配備的困難，發生了時間的限制，於是盲目轟炸成爲敵美遷階段唯一的戰略。敵機不但轟炸日本的各大都市，幷且連中小都市也加以盲目轟炸。這種戰畧的目的，與其說是在破壞軍事設施，不如說是想摧殘日本的士氣。</p>
<p>可是日本的國民都是忠君愛國的。敵機能够炸毀日木國民木造的房屋，可是决不能炸毀日本民族的傳統精神。或者再進一步說，因爲敵機盲目的轟炸，日本國民的敵愾心更其增强起來，造成日木本土决戰的精神要素。</p>
<p>幷且空襲不是作戰的主體，不過是作戰的　助手段而已，就是連日盲目轟炸，也不能具體的實現作戰的目的。日本的軍需工廠大部已經遷到地下，或是高山之中，敵機的破壞力量只能達到各大都市或中小都市，可是都市幷不是決戰力量的根源。我們觀察敵機連日轟炸中的日本的國情，會感到意外的鎭靜，這就足以證明敵美的神經戰略的失敗。</p>
<p>因爲敵美的焦燥愈顯出日木的堅定。日本本士的决戰是决定日本國遝的鬥爭，因此日本的國民都非常鎭靜，刻苦耐勞的傾注全力於各自報國的　位，使日本整個要塞化的建設愈臻完善。敵美的日本本土攻擊之時期愈遲，日本本土之防衛愈堅強。現在敵美一面焦燥一面躊踷的心理，正是决戰時的弱點，而日本一面意志堅定，一面着着準備的實情，正是决戰時致勝的要素。</p>
<p>我們在敵美的焦燥浮動與日本的擊忍不拔的精神狀態中，可以預測無論在日本本土決戰，無論在中國沿岸登陸時，敵美將受到致命的打擊。</p>
<h3 id="c6">日軍事記者　分析戰局 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電日同盟　軍事記者　撰文，分析當前戰局，略謂，敵美現在空襲日本，可謂爲在日本本土作戰之先聲，其目的仍在破壞日本戰力，擾亂民心，故稱之爲戰略轟炸。日本自去歲六月B29型要首次轟炸北九州以來，已歷一年，國內防空設施及國民對空襲事訓練，已達相當水準，惟一般國民對日本航空機生產力頗爲懷疑，實屬杞人之憂。現日本航空機生產，較以往已增加若干倍，又有一部份人士認爲，日本未實行航空邀擊戰，致認爲日本缺乏邀擊之飛機，須知航空機勢力之保持，乃有限度者，故須對現所保有之航空勢力作有效之使用，因而不得不犧牲某方面，以謀航空勢力之增大，而爲本土決戰之剎那，對敵人發動全力，此實爲吾人　憂自重之原因。　伊泰一役，日本因未能補給能力，致還失敗，徵諾此種敎訓，目下　不能輕易消耗航空戰力，一俟本土决戰開始時，再行大舉出擊，收獲澈底擊減敵人之戰果。</p>

<p>滬市軍事評論家，頃就英美蘇三頭會議之內情及美軍之移赴太平洋問題，特作洋切之分析如次：</p>
<h3 id="c8">三頭會議若斷若續 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>關於三頭會議，對於軍事問題之商討，雖未見有正式之發表，但終略加提及。在參加渡次坦會談之英首相邱吉爾，因參加廿五日之國內總選舉而歸國，廿四日發表邱吉爾已返抵倫敦，而會談仍在繼續舉行中。外相艾登及勞工　領袖阿特里亦隨回返國，美總統特魯曼與蘇領袖史太林元帥則仍續續進行會談。即如邱吉爾再能獲選，預定廿七·廿八兩日重赴柏林，而英國方面對邱吉爾之行動，亦已正式發表稱，柏林會談於廿五日決不能中止。惟據另一報道所稱，邱吉爾首相歸國，廿五臼將行休會，但特魯曼與史太林在下星期不諭英之選舉歸任何黨派所勝，則會談仍須繼續進行，而英國當地所稱邱吉爾如在此次選舉失敗時，艾登外相仍必連任，則由　返波次坦進行會談惟阿特里被選爲英國新首相時，則須處理任務，必留居國內。此外，又一報道所稱，參加會談之美國　表團，一部份已離柏林，餘亦將繼續　去，而當局已加以否認。此外報道所稱：特魯曼總統於廿六日抵佛蘭克福，與艾森霍華舉行會談，同時視察該地，並檢閱駐屯美軍，種種傳說，紛歧不一。</p>
<h3 id="c9">敵擬強化指揮機構 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>總之三頭會談之內容，至今嚴守秘密，僅，。惟在最近祇發表東南亞洲司令官蒙特巴頓亦參加會談云云。據廿五倫敦電稱：東南亞洲聯合軍最高司令官蒙特巴頓於廿五日重機抵英，渠會參加柏林會議，另有一發表所稱，蒙特巴頓在波次坦會議中，於聯合軍共同參謀本部目腦室與特魯曼·史太林·邱吉爾舉行會議後，即從空路抵達英國，數日前東南亞洲軍司令官蒙特巴頓與麥克沃塞在馬刺尼會談之日，其後華盛頓報載，强調太平洋作戰指揮機　，尅日改組，期使英軍在西南太平洋區機內作戰，特別擴大。現在婆羅洲之麥克沃塞司令部統轄之戰鬥軍隊，爲英國家聯合軍，該部隊將移轉蒙特巴頓司令部指揮，二星期前蒙特巴頓與麥克沃塞商討西南太平洋之作戰問題，乃將東南亞洲軍及印度軍澳洲軍移轉麥克沃塞之地區作戰，頃已商妥，嗣在十五日蒙特巴頓則赴加爾各答，再參加三頭會議，商討改組辦法，故此次西南太平洋方面之改租，今後麥克沃寒所統率之第七艦隊及航空部隊向何處移動，在想像上難免發動中國大陸之接岸作戰，但在時間上猶難判斷，惟根據敵美兵力之移動及各項情報各種情勢上揣測，或將在本年秋季發動。</p>

<p>據最近巴黎地區司令部所發表稱：現今美國運送之船舶大部份，將於下月，轉移山馬賽直接輸送至太平洋，惟在八月間經由美國之兵力轉運，則較本月份縮減四成。茲據美聯社電稱：在法南港口之　送量，在八月份應增强三倍，根據該項之輸送，與太平洋移動兵力之原案一致，尙有一部份船舶將擔任自美國西海岸向太平洋戰域派遣部隊負　輸送。窺其移動辦法，有下列理由數則：　西太平洋陸軍部隊司令官史坦雅中將，防止美軍上氣沮喪。　國防輸送管理局長陸軍大佐瑪戰喬生稱，美國之陸路交通輸送能力不足，故有採取直　輸運措置。其實美國內充滿壓戰和平空氣，故對太平洋上加强採取兵力之移動，以不往國內赴前綫，而推動作戰。又據美聯社所稱：從馬犠至太平洋之輸運，將可完成，在九月中由歐洲轉移美本國之兵力更爲增强，其時並有德國之五萬噸歐洲號，亦頗利用負責　運，於此可見敵美在八月中必將兵力全力移動。至九月杪時期有所究成作戰上之準備，待於十月間設法展開新作戰。至九月以後之敵兵力移動　在明春作戰時供用，因此有經由美國內之轉運。廿一日華盛頓合衆社電稱：今秋將爲純熟之時期，舉凡在決戰之前，必有繼續性之轟炸，而美軍製軍及海兵隊數師特參加接岸戰，惟在太平洋戰區內，今有美軍三軍，另外一軍則由歐洲向太平洋移動。故美軍計有四軍幽即四十個師團參加，同時美軍企圖在中國沿岸獲取廣州香港二港口，準備在中國大陸作戰，此次攻勢，潔信在十月左右可達最高潮。</p>

<p>如美軍　　中國沿岸之幅州，以直達浙江之　渡附近，或向任何地登陸，其情勢猶難決定，於此可見敵方並沒有作主戰之發動，即如有向日本本土作登陸戰，戰前必將展開實施大陸之接岸作戰，其趨勢逐漸漲單，在敵美方而希望小的犠牲以獲得龐大利益，此種慣技，當爲　免日本本土登陸戰，減少艦兵力被抵抗之損害，　又利用中國人之犧牲，以破壞日本之戰力，故有作種種政治上之謀略工作，以試探和平。在此項企圖下，對日本本土之登陸戰及中國大陸戰之趨向極爲明顯，尤以最　趣味者，則爲美國竭力向日本展開政治謀略攻勢，如在第一戰綫之第七艦隊指揮官金剴特，第三艦隊司令官哈爾塞，航空本部長阿華諾特，及最近任命之美國海兵隊副司令泰茲等等，均竭力宣傳，主張對日本　激烈戰，用以　嚇。總之將日本之指揮官沉着應戰之精神，及與美國第一綫指揮官之濫調攻　戰略相較，不　賽見一斑矣。</p>

<p>百偷二十六日中央社電據巴黎消息，昨日爲貝常第三次受審，法庭空氣極爲嚴肅，前法國首相達拉第亦出庭發表見證供詞，渠曾被禁獄中四年，故髮眉皆曰，據稱：「余欲陳述有關停戰協定以後之事及在獄中聞得有關貝當將軍之情形」，庭上旁聽者均感濃厚之興趣。其時貝富適進入法庭，似乎對五小時之審訊感覺十分不舒，達拉第於是繼續其之供詞謂：「法國之國會在德團之槍刺下組成組希政府，同時將相富之權限授與貝富，而貝當竟往往越權處置一切政務，其時法國之政體實已更改，法共和國已不復存在，此項新政體在一隊革新家及賣國奸賊之支撑下，逐漸產生。當時我等均不信法國之戰敗，故於六月二十日我等乘上瑪雪利亞號船而離開法國，熱知我等尙在海上，忽聞停戰協定已吿簽訂，由是我等遂決意至北非，召集法國愛國份子組織一抗戰團體，我人趕至拉巴特，會見法屬　洛哥總督諾戈斯將軍，與之會商組織抗戰團，然終囚人力物力之極度缺乏，我等只能作罷，瑪雪利亞號船亦於該時返國」。　拉第　續控訴貝當　　司法權，於一九四一年之十月十三日，竟將　逮捕，且暗中裁處之，達拉第並極力否認法國共和國政府將解除武裝之法國交與德人手中，渠痛斥謂：「由一九三六年至一九四〇年之五月，我法國之軍　生產激增不已，同時在一九三七與一九三九年，德國戰車之產量並不强於我法國，其時法國之武裝飛機有三千架以上，在停戰協定之後，法國飛機已有四千二百三十八架，北非之飛機尙不在內，至一九四二年十一月八日，當德國侵入法國南部之際，我等極望貝當或能受愛國心之驅使，再度起而抗戰，陪審因要求貝當供認是否曾在英軍轟炸迭班地區之後，暗中拍電希特勒，表示欲與希特勒合作，共同向聯合國軍抗戰，然辯護士立即起立，並高呼「貝當將軍已宣布不承認法　，故渠對各項問題均不置答」。陪審團中有幾各竟極爲震怒，謂貝當採取此項態度實爲不顧羞恥，最後貝當在椅中輾轉不定，繼而向陪審團稱：「我將如何解釋，彼等之言詞我絲毫未曾聆悉，彼等欲我如何」，由是陪審團提議高聲朗讀貝　拍至希特勒之電報文時，貝當不得不打破渠之緘默，突然起立，向庭上聲稱，「我早已聲明，對各項問題俱不置答」，言罷渠又坐下，兩手　抖，緊握渠之手套。七十三歲之勒勃倫（貝當握權前之法國總統）出　供認見證詞，渠之聲音因情感之極度緊張而起　抖，表情使旁聽者囑目，大部審訊之期，在渠之緊張言詞中　過。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Enemy Landing on Phuket Island, Thailand, Repelled by Japanese Garrison - Battles in the Lok Doung Area of North Borneo <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Shonan, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: On the 25th, at approximately 8:00 AM, two enemy American cruisers approached Phuket Island, Thailand, located 300 kilometers northwest of Penang on the central west coast of the Malay Peninsula. After conducting naval bombardment, approximately 500 enemy troops landed near McCall at the northwest end of the island using five landing craft. The Japanese garrison immediately launched a fierce counterattack, inflicting heavy damage and ultimately repelling the enemy back to sea. The enemy's main force subsequently patrolled the sea southeast of Phuket Island, attacking nearby airfields with naval guns and aerial bombing. However, the enemy's forces were very weak, with only about six transport ships. This landing attempt was undoubtedly merely a probe to test our strength.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: Phuket Island is located in Phuket Province, Thailand, 300 kilometers northwest of Penang Island. The entire island is approximately 30 kilometers east-west and 50 kilometers north-south. The island is a rich tin resource area. Thailand produces 50,000 tons of tin annually, of which the island accounts for eight-tenths. Previously, the mining industry was operated with British capital and managed by overseas Chinese. The ore was transported to Penang. The enemy's attack on the island this time is to support the operations in the Balikpapan oilfield area of Borneo, attempting to seize important southern resources for the war against Japan.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: The enemy in the Miri area of North Borneo still has its main force deployed in the Lok Doung area (20 kilometers north of Miri). They occasionally dispatch small numbers of troops to invade the Japanese defense line in order to expand their territory. On the 23rd, the enemy used several landing craft to navigate a tributary of the Baram River, attempting to land at Alan. The Japanese army in the area ambushed the enemy, repelling them in just 20 minutes. Furthermore, the enemy is eager to use the Miri airfield and appears to have begun using it recently.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Special Attack Units Active, Launching Surprise Attacks at Any Moment - Control of Absolutely Victorious Air Battle Secured <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: Recently, when the enemy attempted to land near the Japanese mainland, the Japanese side repeatedly launched special attack units to meet them head-on and inflict heavy blows. The closer the distance, the more advantageous the activities of the Japanese special attack units become, and the activities of other aviation units are also becoming exceptionally favorable. Okinawa is 700-800 nautical miles away from the Japanese mainland. However, the enemy preparing to land this time is unlikely to launch a landing operation from such a distance. The enemy fleet that previously attacked the mainland with naval guns could only approach the sea area about 30-40 miles from the mainland due to the range of their guns. The operational range of the aircraft from their aircraft carriers is probably between 200 and 500 miles. Although the troop transport ships are further away, the landing craft are fast-moving, so their position distance should also not be far. At the same time, the enemy has widely deployed radio wave detection networks, and the fighter planes have also strengthened their air defense artillery facilities. Therefore, no matter how far away, there is no such thing as a long distance. This war is also a war between land bases and aircraft carrier bases, and the Japanese army is in an absolutely advantageous position and can control an absolutely certain and victorious air battle. At the same time, special attack units will definitely be able to fully exert their active functions. As the distance gets closer, the effectiveness of the enemy's radio wave detectors, which they rely on as a sharp weapon, will be reduced. Even if the enemy's radio waves accurately detect the Japanese aircraft taking off and measure their position, there will be more than 30 minutes to an hour of leeway time, which is another matter. However, at extremely close range, when the enemy aircraft tries to take off, the special attack aircraft will already be in an offensive posture in the enemy's airspace. This happens with incredible speed. Therefore, no matter how quickly the enemy detects the movement of Japanese aircraft, their fighter planes cannot take off immediately. Therefore, in order to defend against the attack of Japanese special attack units, the enemy must station a considerable number of fighter planes in the sky for 24 hours a day to perform patrol duties. The Japanese army not only dispatches special attack units, but also supplements them with fighter planes, making it impossible for the enemy to have even half a second of respite. Even if the attacking enemy has the same number of aircraft as the air force, it is not so simple in reality. If their air force base is on land, that is another matter. However, the enemy aircraft take off and land on the decks of aircraft carriers at sea, and when taking off and landing, the aircraft carrier cannot proceed at full speed. It goes without saying that there will be problems with the aircraft's fuel, and the fuel consumption of the aircraft carrier will also be very different from usual. In addition, drastic weather changes and night often cause unexpected accidents. On the contrary, the Japanese army can launch surprise attacks even at night, and is especially confident in maritime and aerial navigation skills. They can launch surprise attacks at any time, and the bombs carried by the aircraft are larger and more numerous than those used in the Okinawa battle. In addition, when aircraft carriers transport landing craft to the fleet, they are completely exposed to Japanese special attack units, so they must be equipped with considerable aircraft carrier formations for cover. In addition, there must be fuel supply and maintenance facilities. Because the enemy's landing points and targets are fixed and cannot be moved at will, no matter what kind of mobile unit it is, it cannot escape the attacks of Japanese special attack aircraft. This is the enemy's fatal weakness.</p>

<p>Report by President Shimomura</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: The first All-Japan Political Association Branch Manager's Conference was held at the House of Representatives on the 25th. State Minister Shimomura, President of the Information Bureau, respectfully described the Emperor's diligent handling of state affairs and his daily life, saying that His Majesty's sacred body is becoming increasingly healthy and that he personally handles all state affairs.

<h3 id="e4">American Land and Sea Transportation Increasingly Difficult <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: Eager for an early decisive battle with Japan, the United States is striving to expand its land and sea transportation capacity to strengthen its forces and military supplies as the Pacific war situation shifts. This trend has been particularly noticeable since last month. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz made a bold statement when the mobile units launched an attack, saying, "The Pacific war situation is on the verge of the landing stage." Judging from these various circumstances, the great decisive battle between Japan and the United States, each deploying its full strength, will be in the near future. The current state of American land and sea transportation capacity is as follows: The withdrawal of troops and materials from Europe: It is said that at the end of the European war, the total strength of the American army on the European front was approximately 3.7 million. Among them, 500,000 will remain in Europe. Except for about 1.1-1.2 million returning to their home country for demobilization, the rest will be transferred to various places on the Pacific war front. Transporting such a large number of troops from Europe requires traversing long sea lanes to reach the Pacific war front. If we consider the transportation of military supplies and the supply of new military goods from the home country, the American maritime transport future is extremely difficult. Recalling the precedent of the last European war, it took the American side more than a year to withdraw troops from Europe, we can imagine. According to the European Invasion Force Transportation Command, since the end of the war against Germany until the end of June, the total number of American troops withdrawn reached 310,000. Even now, the number of troops withdrawn is only 573,000, which falls short of the initial target of the American Transportation Command to withdraw 740,000 in two months, which shows the difficulty of its transportation capacity. The state of railway transport in the home country: The American Army Department stated that transporting the materials for each division requires dozens of freight trains or more. As in the past, the number of trains transporting troops to the UK reached as many as 1,500 per day. The number of troops and materials currently being transported to the Pacific war zone is far greater than what was transported to the UK in the past. Moreover, there were more than two years of preparation time for the European landing operation. On the contrary, this emergency transport is scheduled to be completed in just three months. Therefore, more than 7,500 military transport vehicles have been converted for the sole purpose of transporting troops. The American government has been working hard to increase vehicle production since last year in order to cope with emergency situations and strive to enhance land transport capacity. It remains questionable whether the problem of insufficient military vehicles can be alleviated in the future. The difficulty of war transportation, in addition to the lack of trains, is the lack of railway employees. This situation is particularly severe in the western states. US President Truman said that if 65,000 new employees are not added quickly, the supply to the Pacific front will encounter considerable obstacles.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Enemy America's Impatience and Japan's Steadfastness <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>In the past few days, this city has been subjected to indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft. This is a strategy of nerve warfare and also a manifestation of enemy America's impatience with the war.</p>
<p>Enemy America hopes to end the war against Japan as soon as possible. First, because the longer the war drags on, the more sacrifices the military will make and the more materials will be consumed. Although Enemy America prides itself on its abundant material resources, it does not want to lose a large number of human resources. Therefore, it eagerly hopes that the war can end soon. Second, since the end of the European war, Enemy American public opinion has clearly shown signs of relaxation. Therefore, the generals in charge of the Pacific operations cannot help but become anxious. Third, the Soviet Union is now recuperating, and the work of rehabilitation and production is gradually beginning. Enemy America does not have time for this. If the war against Japan is prolonged, it will inevitably affect the balance of international power in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, Enemy America is spreading various rumors, probing for strategies, and doing its best to drag the Soviet Union into the whirlpool of the war against Japan. The activities of the San Francisco Conference and Song Ziwen's visit to Moscow are all driven by this motive. The most egregious of these strategies is to try to overwhelm Japan's vigorous fighting spirit with continuous indiscriminate bombing.</p>
<p>After sacrificing a large number of troops and ships to invade Okinawa Island, Enemy America is loudly proclaiming the slogans of landing on the Chinese coast and attacking the Japanese mainland. However, the experience of the fierce battle in Okinawa makes them afraid to try lightly. Moreover, in fact, due to the difficulty of deployment, there is a time limit. Therefore, indiscriminate bombing has become Enemy America's only strategy in this transitional stage. Enemy aircraft are not only bombing major Japanese cities, but also indiscriminately bombing small and medium-sized cities. The purpose of this strategy is less to destroy military facilities and more to destroy the morale of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>However, the people of Japan are all loyal to the emperor and love their country. Enemy aircraft can destroy the wooden houses of the Japanese people, but they can never destroy the traditional spirit of the Japanese nation. Or, to put it another way, because of the indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft, the animosity of the Japanese people has been further enhanced, creating the spiritual elements for the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>Moreover, air raids are not the main body of combat, but only an auxiliary means of combat. Even continuous indiscriminate bombing cannot concretely realize the purpose of the war. Most of Japan's munitions factories have been moved underground or to high mountains. The destructive power of enemy aircraft can only reach major cities or small and medium-sized cities, but cities are not the source of decisive combat power. Observing the national conditions of Japan under the continuous bombing by enemy aircraft, we feel an unexpected calmness, which is enough to prove the failure of Enemy America's nerve strategy.</p>
<p>Because Enemy America's impatience reveals Japan's steadfastness even more. The decisive battle on the Japanese mainland is a struggle to determine the fate of Japan. Therefore, the Japanese people are very calm and pour all their efforts into their respective positions to serve the country, making the construction of Japan's entire fortress more perfect. The later the period of Enemy America's attack on the Japanese mainland, the stronger the defense of the Japanese mainland will be. The psychology of Enemy America, which is now impatient and hesitant, is a weakness in the decisive battle. The fact that Japan is steadfast in its will and is preparing step by step is the key to victory in the decisive battle.</p>
<p>In Enemy America's impatience and agitation and Japan's indomitable spirit, we can predict that Enemy America will suffer a fatal blow whether in the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland or when landing on the Chinese coast.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Military Reporter Analyzes War Situation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency dispatch: A military reporter from the Japanese Allied Press wrote an article analyzing the current war situation, stating that Enemy America's current air raids on Japan can be said to be a prelude to the war on the Japanese mainland. Its purpose is still to destroy Japan's war capability and disrupt the morale of the people, so it is called strategic bombing. It has been a year since Japan was first bombed by the B29 in Kitakyushu last June. Domestic air defense facilities and the people's air raid training have reached a considerable level. However, the general public is quite skeptical about Japan's aircraft production capacity, which is really unnecessary worry. Japan's aircraft production is now several times higher than before. Some people believe that Japan has not implemented an aerial interception war, so they think that Japan lacks interception aircraft. It is necessary to know that the maintenance of air power is limited, so it is necessary to make effective use of the current air power. Therefore, we have to sacrifice some aspects in order to increase our air power and launch a full-scale attack on the enemy at the moment of the decisive battle on the mainland. This is the reason why we should be cautious. In the Italian campaign, Japan failed because it could not supply its forces. Learning from this lesson, we cannot easily consume our air power. Once the decisive battle on the mainland begins, we will launch a major offensive to completely reduce the enemy's war results.</p>

<p>A military commentator in Shanghai recently made a detailed analysis of the internal situation of the Anglo-American-Soviet summit and the American military's transfer to the Pacific, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e8">Anglo-American-Soviet Summit Intermittent <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Anglo-American-Soviet summit, although there has been no formal announcement regarding the discussion of military issues, it has been mentioned briefly. British Prime Minister Churchill, who participated in the Potsdam talks, returned home to participate in the domestic general election on the 25th. It was announced on the 24th that Churchill had returned to London and that the talks were still continuing. Foreign Secretary Eden and Labour leader Atlee also returned home. US President Truman and Soviet leader Marshal Stalin continued to hold talks. Even if Churchill is re-elected, he is scheduled to return to Berlin on the 27th and 28th. The British side has also officially announced that the Berlin talks cannot be suspended on the 25th. However, according to another report, Prime Minister Churchill's return home means that the meeting will be adjourned on the 25th. However, Truman and Stalin will continue the talks next week, regardless of which party wins the British election. The British side also said that if Churchill fails in this election, Foreign Secretary Eden will still be re-elected. He will return to Potsdam to continue the talks. However, if Atlee is elected as the new British Prime Minister, he will have to deal with his duties and must stay in the country. In addition, another report stated that some of the American delegation participating in the talks have left Berlin and the rest will continue to leave. The authorities have denied this. Another report stated that President Truman will arrive in Frankfurt on the 26th to hold talks with Eisenhower and inspect the area and the American troops stationed there. Various rumors are inconsistent.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Enemy Intends to Strengthen Command Structure <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>In short, the content of the Anglo-American-Soviet summit remains a secret to this day. Only. However, it was only recently announced that Southeast Asia Commander Mountbatten also participated in the talks. According to a London report on the 25th, Mountbatten, Supreme Commander of the Southeast Asia Allied Forces, arrived in England on the 25th. He will participate in the Berlin conference. Another announcement stated that Mountbatten arrived in the UK by air after holding a meeting with Truman, Stalin, and Churchill in the joint staff headquarters of the Allied Forces at the Potsdam Conference. A few days ago, Southeast Asia Army Commander Mountbatten and McCauley held talks in Manipur. Subsequently, the Washington Post reported, emphasizing that the Pacific operations command structure would be reorganized soon to enable the British army to operate in the Southwest Pacific region, especially expanding the scope of operations. The combat troops currently under the command of McCauley's headquarters in Borneo are the British National Allied Forces. This unit will be transferred to the command of Mountbatten's headquarters. Two weeks ago, Mountbatten and McCauley discussed the Southwest Pacific operations. It was agreed that the Southeast Asia Army, the Indian Army, and the Australian Army would be transferred to McCauley's area for operations. Later, on the 15th, Mountbatten went to Calcutta to participate in the tripartite meeting to discuss the reorganization plan. Therefore, in this reorganization of the Southwest Pacific, it is difficult to judge in terms of time where McCauley's Seventh Fleet and air force will move in the future. However, according to the enemy's troop movements and various information, it is speculated that it may launch a landing operation on the Chinese mainland this autumn.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Enemy America Transfers Troops to the Pacific <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>According to a recent announcement by the Paris Regional Command, most of the ships currently used by the United States will be transferred to Marseille next month to transport troops directly to the Pacific. However, the number of troops transferred through the United States in August will be reduced by 40% compared to this month. According to a United Press report, the amount of transportation in the southern French ports should be tripled in August. The transportation is consistent with the original plan to move troops to the Pacific. Some ships will also be responsible for transporting troops from the west coast of the United States to the Pacific war zone. The reasons for the relocation are as follows: Lieutenant General Stanley, commander of the US Army forces in the West Pacific, is preventing the American army from becoming discouraged. Colonel Marsh, director of the National Defense Transportation Administration, said that the US land transportation capacity is insufficient, so direct transportation measures have been taken. In fact, the United States is full of peace-loving air, so it is strengthening the movement of troops to the Pacific to avoid going to the front from home and to promote operations. According to the Associated Press, the transportation from Marseille to the Pacific will be completed. The transfer of American troops from Europe to the United States will be strengthened in mid-September, and the 50,000-ton Europa from Germany will also be used to take charge of transportation. From this, it can be seen that the enemy America will move all its troops in mid-August. At the end of September, it will be prepared for combat operations and will try to launch new operations in October. The enemy's troop movements after September will be used for operations in the spring of next year, so there will be a transfer through the United States. A United Press report from Washington on the 21st stated that this autumn will be a time for full preparation. Before the decisive battle, there will be continuous bombing, and several divisions of the US Army and Marines will participate in the landing battle. However, there are now three armies of the US military in the Pacific war zone. Another army is moving from Europe to the Pacific. Therefore, the US military plans to have four armies, that is, 40 divisions, participate. At the same time, the US military is trying to capture the ports of Guangzhou and Hong Kong on the Chinese coast to prepare for operations on the Chinese mainland. This offensive will reach its climax around October.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Enemy Launches Strategic Offensive <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>It is still difficult to determine whether the US military will attack Fuzhou on the Chinese coast and go straight to the vicinity of Hangzhou in Zhejiang, or land at any other place. From this, it can be seen that the enemy has not launched a major war. Even if there is a landing war on the Japanese mainland, a landing operation on the mainland will be launched before the war. The trend is gradually rising. The enemy America hopes to gain huge benefits with small sacrifices. This habitual technique is to avoid the landing battle on the Japanese mainland and reduce the damage to the ships and troops by resistance. It also uses the sacrifices of the Chinese people to destroy Japan's war capability. Therefore, it has carried out various political and strategic efforts to test peace. Under this plan, the trend of landing on the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland war is extremely obvious. What is most interesting is that the United States is doing its best to launch a political and strategic offensive against Japan. For example, First Fleet Commander King, Third Fleet Commander Halsey, Aviation Chief Arnold, and the recently appointed US Marine Corps Deputy Commander Tate, etc., are all doing their best to promote the idea of a fierce war against Japan to intimidate Japan. In short, comparing the calm and resilient spirit of the Japanese commanders with the indiscriminate and aggressive strategies of the American front-line commanders, one can see the difference.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Approximately fifty enemy B-29 type aircraft attacked the Kawasaki area starting around 10:00 PM on the 25th. There was some damage in the surrounding vicinity. The Japanese side claims to have shot down five enemy aircraft. Also, a portion of the enemy aircraft operated over the Nagano, Gunma, and other areas of Japan, attempting to restrain the activities of the Japanese airborne units. It is noted that the American aircraft used almost exclusively bombs when attacking Kawasaki City, suggesting to us their future methods of attacking industrial cities, which deserves our military's attention.</p>
<p>Osaka, 26th (Central News Agency) - At 00:00 AM on the 26th, approximately fifteen enemy B-29 type aircraft invaded from the Kii Channel. Among them, ten advanced northeast along the Wakasa Bay, while the other five operated in Osaka Bay, seemingly dropping mines. Also, starting at 9:15 PM on the 25th, more than ten B-29 type aircraft, divided into four groups, dispersed and invaded the Central Military District, operating in various locations such as Matsue, Hiroshima, and Fukui.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Two hundred and thirty enemy small aircraft operated over the northern coast of Shikoku and the southern islands of Osaka Bay from 5:00 AM to 6:30 AM on the 25th. Around 9:00 AM, ninety enemy small aircraft invaded the Tokai Military District from Shiga Prefecture and, after operating in the northwestern part of Japan, departed. Also, between 11:00 AM and 4:30 PM on the 26th, approximately one hundred enemy carrier-based aircraft invaded the Tokai region of Japan, targeting airfields, transportation facilities, ships, and cities as their primary targets, and then fled south.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the East Asia policy discussed during the Three-Power Conference, according to a Potsdam dispatch from the Exchange Telegraph Company, it was decided during the meeting on the 22nd that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union would take joint action against the Japanese government when the conference concluded.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that during the Potsdam Conference, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union reached a decision regarding the war against Japan and will issue a joint communique to Japan in the near future. The Japanese diplomatic circles are not paying much attention to this claim because the agenda of the Potsdam Conference is being kept strictly confidential by the three participating countries. The reports from the United States and Britain are based solely on conjecture and official rumors, confusing the public and are not credible. However, this does not mean that the Three-Power Conference did not discuss East Asian issues. The Japanese side believes that there is a high probability that the leaders of the three nations discussed East Asian issues. However, much of the information regarding the war against Japan reported by the United States and Britain contains propaganda, so the Japanese press and public opinion are taking a calm attitude toward it.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - High wartime prices are an unavoidable phenomenon. However, judging from the current rampant price increases in various regions, it is already contrary to the current rules of the wartime system. The recent price problem is not simply a matter of material shortages causing panic. It is actually caused by merchants manipulating speculation. The authorities, fearing the high rise of commodity prices and the insufficient number of currency chips, resulted in a panic, so they repeatedly issued large bills, hoping to relieve the degree of panic. Unexpectedly, every time they issued them, the price soared again. The result was that the more they issued, the more intense the price increase, forming a mutually causal phenomenon. From this, it can be seen that issuing currency is not a way to solve the panic phenomenon. Furthermore, in order to absorb capital to stabilize prices, the authorities issued gold bonds in May of this year. To date, there have been four issues. As a result, a considerable amount of capital has been recovered, but it has had no effect on the policy of stabilizing prices. Moreover, the price of gold itself is still soaring wildly, creating an unprecedented record of more than 10,000 yuan per ounce. From this, we can once again prove the failure of the gold bond policy. The current currency problem is presenting an extremely serious situation. Shanghai clearing bills are full of counterfeit money, and buying and selling transactions are all empty words. If this continues, currency inflation will inevitably deepen. It is hoped that the government authorities will quickly adopt effective policies to relieve the people's suffering.</p>

<p>Paris, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Paris, yesterday was the third day of Pétain's trial. The atmosphere in the courtroom was extremely solemn. Former French Prime Minister Daladier also appeared in court to give testimony. He had been imprisoned for four years, so his hair and eyebrows were all white. He said, "I want to state the matters related to the armistice agreement and what I heard in prison about General Pétain." The audience in the courtroom was very interested. At that time, Baufre entered the courtroom, seemingly feeling very uncomfortable after five hours of interrogation. Daladier then continued his testimony, saying, "The French Congress formed the Vichy government under the bayonets of the Germans, and at the same time granted the power of the prime minister to Pétain, who often overstepped his authority to handle all government affairs. At that time, the French political system had changed, and the French Republic no longer existed. This new political system gradually emerged under the support of a group of reformers and traitors. At that time, we did not believe in the defeat of France, so on June 20th, we boarded the Massilia ship and left France. We were still at sea when we suddenly heard that the armistice agreement had been signed, so we decided to go to North Africa to gather French patriots to organize a resistance group. We rushed to Rabat to meet with General Noguès, the French Governor of Morocco, to discuss organizing a resistance group, but due to the extreme lack of manpower and material resources, we could only give up. The Massilia ship also returned to the country at that time." Daladier continued to accuse Pétain of usurping judicial power, and on October 13, 1941, he was arrested and secretly tried. Daladier also vehemently denied that the French Republic government handed over the disarmed France to the Germans. He angrily said, "From 1936 to May 1940, the military production of our France increased sharply. At the same time, in 1937 and 1939, the production of German tanks was not stronger than that of our France. At that time, France had more than 3,000 armed aircraft. After the armistice agreement, France had 4,238 aircraft, not including the aircraft in North Africa. On November 8, 1942, when Germany invaded southern France, we hoped very much that Pétain would be driven by patriotism and rise up to resist again. The jury asked Pétain to admit whether he had secretly telegraphed Hitler after the British army bombed the Dieppe area, expressing his desire to cooperate with Hitler and jointly resist the Allied forces. However, the defense lawyer immediately stood up and shouted, "General Pétain has announced that he does not recognize the French court, so he will not answer any questions." Some of the jurors were extremely angry, saying that Pétain's attitude was shameless. Finally, Pétain twisted and turned in his chair, and then said to the jury, "How will I explain? I have not heard a single word of what they said. What do they want me to do?" Therefore, the jury proposed to read aloud Pétain's telegram to Hitler. Pétain had no choice but to break his silence and suddenly stood up and said to the court, "I have already stated that I will not answer any questions on the matter." After he finished speaking, he sat down, his hands trembling, tightly holding his gloves. Seventy-three-year-old Lebrun (the President of France before Pétain seized power) appeared to testify. His voice trembled because of extreme emotional tension, and his expression drew attention from the audience. Most of the trial period passed in his nervous words.</p>

<h3 id="e23">A Glimpse of Chuansha <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Shan Yue</p>
<p>Chuansha is inhabited by ten thousand families. It faces the East China Sea, borders Shanghai Municipality, adjoins Nanhui to the south, and connects to the Pudong North District to the north. The terrain is alluvial coastal land. The river is Sanzao Port. For land transportation, there is the Shangchuan Road small train, from Chuansha to Zhenning Temple in Shanghai Pudong. Water transport consists of small steamships from Shanghai to Chuansha. There used to be small ferries to Nanhui, but they have been suspended due to security concerns. It is now divided into four districts, four towns, and sixteen townships, with over 26,000 households and a population of about 128,000.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Industry, Commerce, and Finance <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The county is a salt-producing area, with seawalls along the coast and abundant production, which is transported and sold to Shanghai and various places. Commerce is influenced by the agricultural aspect, so there are no large capital stores. Recently, due to the insufficient supply of goods and overwhelming burdens, news of store closures is frequently heard. There are only two financial institutions: Hexin Trust Company and Pudong Economic Mutual Aid Society. High-interest lending is rampant. Before, one was overdrawing several times beyond its capital. Before the incident, towels and lace were the main products, and there are still a few towel and homespun factories, employing female workers for spinning and weaving. There are also three small yarn factories.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Agricultural Products and Land Tax <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Farmers' lives are being exploited from all sides, bordering on bankruptcy, and they have no one to turn to. Agricultural products include cotton and wheat, but the yield is not abundant. The annual production is about 70,000 stones, which is not enough for the local food supply. Cotton is about 30,000 dans. Apart from supplying local yarn factories, a small amount is transported to Shanghai. The annual wheat yield is 80,000 dans, and soybeans are over 8,000 dans. The local soil is still fertile, but the farming methods are very old.</p>
<p>The amount of the land tax is estimated at more than 197,400 mu. Due to poor management, the intermediaries embezzle and embezzle, resulting in the amount paid being less than half of the total. The current director, in addition to finding ways to recover the taxes in arrears, is also starting to collect the old land taxes from previous years. From June 1st of this year, it has been ordered to start collecting in kind, estimating about 181,000 mu of first-class fields and 16,400 mu of second-class fields, totaling 197,400 mu. The collection range is from six sheng to one dou. Recently, eight or nine townships have been adjusted and changed to first-class land tax.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Overview of Education <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The education level is very low. Educational facilities are limited due to funding and are makeshift. There are eight complete county primary schools, thirteen junior primary schools, nine registered private schools, and six or seven private schools similar to private tutoring schools. There are no public middle schools, only two private middle schools. The total number of primary and middle school students in the county is about 5,000. But school-age children account for about one-tenth of the population, numbering over 12,000. Apart from those enrolled, the number of out-of-school children reaches 7,000. School funding and teacher treatment are poor. Private schools collect rice. It is said that the county's education funding was originally over 132,000 yuan. This year, the budget has increased by 30%, totaling over 174,000 yuan. In fact, it is difficult to achieve educational success with this amount of money to cope with the crazy prices. It is now heard that another budget is being prepared, requesting additional funding. As for teacher treatment, in addition to a small amount of rice each month, they are given an additional 4,000 to 10,000 yuan. The degree of misery is similar everywhere. For public education, there are two public education centers and agricultural education centers, with a budget of over 17,000 yuan and four or five employees.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Public Health <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>In terms of public health, there is one municipal Chuansha clinic, which is directly under the Municipal Health Bureau. However, due to financial constraints, the equipment is simple and rudimentary. In addition to following the instructions of the Municipal Health Bureau to regularly administer vaccinations and treat general diseases, the institute is currently improving the quarantine shelter and plans to expand the clinic into a county hospital. The county government has appointed the director of the clinic to be responsible for the implementation of its funding and equipment. The local people's drug habits are higher, and it is said that drug prohibition matters are particularly important.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Economic Police Agency Reorganization: Establishment of Economic Section; Merger of Economic Security Section and Economic Police Squad; City Police Department, to reorganize its structure and increase work efficiency, will merge the Fourth Division's Economic Security Section and the Economic Police Squad, reorganizing them into an Economic Section. It will be divided into four groups and four teams, and the areas of jurisdiction for each team will be defined as follows: <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Jurisdictional Areas of Each Team:</p>
<p>Economic Police Team 1 (located within the General Bureau): Jurisdiction over the Huangpu, Old Zhabei, New Chen, Yu Temple, and sections of the Dongchang Road branch (north of Dongchang Road and south of Pudong Road).</p>
<p>Economic Police Team 2 (located within the Taishan Road branch): Jurisdiction over the Taishan Road, Xujiahui, Dangtu Road, Fenglai Road, and Xieji Road branches, and sections of the Dongchang Road branch (south of Dongchang Road).</p>
<p>Economic Police Team 3 (located within the Hongkou branch): Jurisdiction over the Hongkou, West Hongkou, Zhabei, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai Railway Station, Xinshi Street, Ti'an Bridge, Yulin Road, and Yangshupu branches, and sections of the Dongchang Road branch (east of Youdong Road).</p>
<p>Economic Police Team 4 (located within the Huashan Road branch): Jurisdiction over the Jiangning Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Putuo Road, Huashan Road, and Changde Road branches, and sections of the Yulin Road branch. As for personnel transfers, former Economic Police Captain Fuda Shigeichi is appointed as the Section Chief of the Fourth Division's Economic Section, and Deputy Captain Yang Guang'an as the Deputy Section Chief. In addition, Deputy Director of the New Chen Branch Yuqi Litoku is transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Yangshupu Branch, with the vacancy filled by former Deputy Section Chief of the Economic Security Section Kahanaga Nagashige. As for former Economic Security Section Chief Sakatoku Shigemo, due to physical weakness, he is temporarily transferred to become a specialist in the First Division.</p>
<p>Relief for Air Raid Victims in This City: Central Government Allocates Special Funds: A total of 50 million yuan is allocated as relief funds.</p>
<p>Following the enemy's American planes bombing Shanghai's urban areas for several consecutive days, many of our innocent citizens have suffered casualties. Upon hearing the news, the central government expressed its deep concern and yesterday specially allocated 50 million yuan as relief funds.</p>
<p>Police Department Provides Preferential Treatment to Police Officers Killed in Air Raids: The City Police Department, considering that Zhao Guilin, police officer number 1952, first class of the Tilanqiao Branch, bravely performed his duty and died during the enemy air raid on the 17th of this month, which is highly commendable, will, in addition to ordering a separate memorial service, also issue a pension of 1.5 million yuan. According to reports, when the enemy planes attacked on the 17th of this month, Officer Zhao still bravely stood guard, directing the public to take shelter, resulting in him being struck by bullets and dying on duty. The branch bureau held a funeral service for him on the 18th at the Guohua Funeral Home, and a memorial service will be held soon. The Air Defense Headquarters will also give him an award.</p>
<p>Repayment of Funds Borrowed by Consumer Cooperatives: The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association initiated the organization of a police consumer cooperative (now named the Police Welfare Society) to assist the police bureau two years ago and temporarily borrowed funds from various industry guilds and all sectors of society, with a weekly interest rate of one percent and a repayment period of one year. Secretary-General Luo of the city government has now approved the full repayment. The repayment method is as follows:</p>
<p>From July 30th for one week, will be the repayment date.</p>
<p>Collect money at the Citizen Welfare Association (address: Chinese Red Cross, Xingan Road) with the original receipt.</p>
<p>For principal and interest of 5,000 yuan or less, cash will be paid. For amounts over 5,000 yuan, checks will be issued, and the odd amounts will be rounded off. (Amounts of forty yuan or less will be increased to one hundred yuan).</p>
<p>Those who do not come to collect the money within the specified period will have the money donated to the city's air raid relief fund after the deadline.</p>
<p>Enemy Exaggerated Propaganda Regarding the Results of the Attack on Shanghai: A few days ago, the enemy planes attacked Shanghai, causing minor damage. However, Commander McWhorter's headquarters announced that 300 planes came, sinking three Japanese warships and damaging many other ships and aircraft fields. This is pure fabrication. The enemy's American's absurd and exaggerated propaganda is truly ridiculous. According to investigations, although the enemy planes attempted to bomb Japanese small warships that day, none were hit, and all the bombs fell into the Huangpu River. Only one small sampan was destroyed. This is the truth and is known to all citizens of the city. In particular, the enemy's claim of shooting down 45 Japanese planes is completely inaccurate. The enemy's American has always been known for their nonsensical propaganda, so their boastful claims are not worth laughing at.</p>
<p>Abnormal Prosperity of Various Bank and Money Exchange Businesses in This City; Speculation, Hoarding, and Mortgage Lending Are Increasingly Popular; The business of banks and money exchanges in this city is abnormally prosperous. Although they have made profits in recent years, the normal business conceals a crisis, which is unknown to outsiders. In the past, the main business of various banks and money exchanges was fixed deposits, savings deposits, and industrial and commercial loans. According to a recent investigation, there has been a major change. Legitimate industrial and commercial loans are gradually declining, while speculative stock trading and mortgage loans for nationally-owned goods are becoming increasingly popular, and the interest rates charged are also particularly high. In terms of deposits, fixed deposits and savings deposits have decreased rather than increased and are now at the lowest level. Demand deposits have increased by hundreds of times. In order to attract depositors, some small and medium-sized banks have also specially increased interest rates on demand deposits. In the past, demand deposits did not pay interest, but now it is stipulated that interest be paid.</p>
<p>Security Prices Decline Again: The trading situation in the gold security market yesterday was the same as the previous day. Trading was sluggish, and prices declined, falling by 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening: 10.2 million yuan, Highest: 10.2 million yuan, Lowest: 9.7 million yuan, Closing: 9.7 million yuan, Down 1 million yuan from the previous day, Volume: 15 taels.</p>
<p>Over 4,000 Tons of Coal in Storage Allocated to the Coal Management Society: Since its establishment, the Shanghai Coal Industry Joint Association has been actively working to facilitate the source of coal supplies. However, due to a lack of transportation and difficult transportation, large-scale purchases have not yet achieved the desired results. It is now known that the association, with the cooperation of the Central China Coal Association, has specially allocated a large amount of stored coal to supply industrial production and civilian needs. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Manufacturing Focus on Coal Balls: The association's allocation of stored coal from the Xingtan Association totals more than 4,000 tons, which will be distributed on a priority basis. In addition to distributing a large part to various factories at parity prices, 1,200 tons will be distributed to the City Economic Bureau at no profit for manufacturing and distribution.</p>
<p>Preparing to Borrow Funds to Purchase Ships: Due to actual needs, the association is preparing to borrow special funds from the Ministry of Finance to purchase ships for transporting coal. It has now submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese Industrial Association, for the purpose of promoting industrial production and meeting civilian needs, has decided to fully support the association's work.</p>
<p>"Family Doctor" is a Treasure Trove of Common Sense: The Medical Consultant for New Families: Donate 5,000 Yuan and Receive a Free Copy.</p>
<p>Traditionally, books on Chinese medicine have often suffered from two problems: either they are too profound, dry, and boring, or they are excessively Westernized, unsuitable for the local situation, resulting in a lack of practical application. The book "Family Doctor" is compiled by a medical expert who has spent years of effort, describing common diseases that are seen in families, using the principles of Chinese and Western medicine to guide people in correct prevention methods. The writing is lively, simple, and interesting, with refined illustrations, making it even more vivid. Even those without scientific knowledge can understand it clearly and be free from confusion. "Family Doctor" is divided into categories, totaling seventeen chapters and over tens of thousands of words. In more than one hundred and eighty pages, it discusses family life, health, disease prevention and treatment, and nutrition, which is the main focus, accounting for one-fifth of the entire book. It discusses the functions and preservation of vitamins in various foods, and it explains the facts about rice in detail. It advocates eating brown rice and substandard wheat because the outer skin of rice and wheat contains a large amount of Vitamin B, while refined white rice and foreign flour lack essential vitamins. This alone shows the author's keen insights. In addition, topics such as tuberculosis, theories on sexes, venereal diseases, and theories on fetal and child care all have precise and practical advice, making them a valuable reference for general families.</p>
<p>"Family Doctor" encompasses everything, is extremely rich, and is a treasure trove of common sense for Chinese families. It is the medical consultant for Chinese families. Having this book will bring countless benefits. Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory spares no expense (each book costs about 7,000 yuan) to print and distribute 100,000 copies to Shen Bao and the Young Men's and Women's Christian Associations as "Family Doctor Scholarship Funds," and 50,000 copies to news organizations as loan scholarship funds for the "Two Movements," benefiting poor students and the health of families in our country. Their good intentions deserve our highest gratitude!</p>

<p>Household Grains: Decision to Distribute in Stages: Three Types: Corn, Sorghum, and Dried Sweet Potatoes.</p>
<p>The City Economic Bureau, concerned that rising grain prices are significantly affecting the livelihoods of citizens, previously approved the City Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association to hold ten phases of fair-priced miscellaneous grain sales, which were well received by middle and lower-class citizens. Therefore, the bureau has recently been working hard to liaise with relevant parties to obtain a batch of miscellaneous grains, including corn, sorghum, and dried sweet potatoes. It has been decided to distribute these grains in stages to households in the city to improve their food supply.</p>
<p>Although this batch of miscellaneous grains is limited, the method of distribution in stages has been finalized. The bureau has notified the associations of rice retailers in each district and each rice retailer to prepare for payment and delivery of goods. Once the goods are received, a public announcement will be made in the newspaper.</p>

<p>National Forum: A Humble Proposal for Entertainment Venues to Accommodate Refugees by Ji Gu: This city has been devastated by air raids for days. It goes without saying that countless civilians have been killed and injured in the affected areas. Most of those who survived have fled to the former One-Eight districts. These people are mostly from the working class. Their original homes and assets have been destroyed in one day, and they have no relatives or friends to rely on, resulting in them living a homeless and miserable existence. Relief and accommodation are urgently needed. Looking around this city, the various dance halls and entertainment venues are still full of lavish spending. This phenomenon not only goes against the principle of mutual assistance among people but is also not allowed during wartime austerity. The authorities and various sectors are currently planning relief work for disaster victims in various ways. If the entertainment venues are temporarily converted into refugee shelters, it would serve both purposes. I dare to offer this humble suggestion for reference.</p>
<p>Using Savings to Relieve Air Raid Victims: We received letters from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, all of whom are donating their savings to help air raid victims. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>The staff of Jihuatang Pharmacy wrote: "Every summer, businesses usually give out watermelon money to their employees so they can buy watermelons to relieve the summer heat. This year, watermelons are extremely expensive. If one wants to enjoy them a little, the cost would be considerable. The staff of our store, in view of the current intense air raids and the large number of deaths and injuries, and the urgent need for first aid medicines and materials for burials, believe that this consumption can be saved. Therefore, we have decided to send this money to your organization. We intend to use half of it for the air raid relief fund and half to forward it to the Pushan Villa, in order to inspire responses from all sectors. Enclosed is a check for one million yuan. Please accept it."</p>
<p>Mr. Xue Bingchu wrote: "Recent bombings have been devastating, and the affected areas are getting larger and larger. The number of disaster victims is also increasing. Our innocent civilians are suffering this unprovoked disaster. It is heartbreaking. I hope that people in society will embrace the principle of helping each other in times of need and generously contribute to promote post-disaster relief work. The feeling of compassion is inherent in everyone. We should use our savings or do what we can to help with relief. Enclosed is a draft for 700,000 yuan, and a student, Xu Shangyun, has also attached 520,000 yuan. Please donate them to the air raid relief fund. Also, donate 200,000 yuan to the Puhua Villa. Please accept and transfer them accordingly."</p>
<p>Reader Yang Jieming wrote: "This city is suffering from air raids more and more every day. Disaster victims are displaced, and there are many deaths and injuries. Since we are all compatriots, how can we sit idly by? We should do our part to help. To respond to this situation, we have collected 600,000 yuan. Please forward it to the relief authorities as soon as possible. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it will not solve the problem. It is important to know that many a little makes a mickle. We hope that all kind-hearted people in Shanghai will respond enthusiastically and donate generously with the spirit of perseverance. Then the amount will be considerable, and disaster victims will benefit a lot."</p>
<p>News from All Sectors Regarding Disaster Relief:</p>
<p>Jinkang Pharmacy Donates Red Potion: Jinkang Pharmacy wrote: "This city has recently suffered air raids. There have been many deaths and injuries. It is a heartbreaking sight. Our pharmacy is deeply concerned and has specially selected and purchased five pounds of Lighthouse Brand standard red potion. Please deliver it to the rescue agency. Standard red potion is made with Lighthouse Brand pigments. It has excellent sterilizing and disinfecting effects. This is a small contribution, but it expresses our sincere concern. We hope that businesses in this city will continue to donate generously. We look forward to it."</p>
<p>Zhenru Clinic Sets Up First Aid Station: Due to the frequent air raids in recent days, the Zhenru Town Clinic has specially set up a first aid station, and everything is ready.
