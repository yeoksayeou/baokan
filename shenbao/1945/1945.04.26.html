<h3>日軍堅守第一綫陣地　在冲繩南部奮戰　海軍攻機繼續猛烈拼撞</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　冲繩木島南部敵軍之攻擊，自二十三日晟來漸形熾烈，津波西方一公里半之上原及連接我如古南方一公里之柵原一帶，尤為激烈，敵軍以千餘之衆，伴戰車十數輛，近迫日軍陣地，然日軍仍堅守第一陣綫而奮戰中。又當山嘉敷南一公里以西之敵軍行動，較該地東方之敵稍失活潑，其意似在銳意補充兵力軍陣，準備次期作戰。蓋自十九日敵軍開始總攻勢以來，迄二十三日正午，判明敵軍損失如下：殺傷兵員六千名，擊毀戰車八十輛，破壞大砲十一門，破壞軍需品堆　四處，鹵獲迫擊砲二，重輕機槍三十六，機關砲一，對戰車連射砲二，此外，並破壞汽車，兵器，彈藥等甚夥。又日軍海上特攻機之攻擊依然猛烈，二十二日經拚撞所收戰果，已判明者計擊沉或重創敵空母二艘及戰艦，巡洋艦，大型艦等十艘，此外並有若干艦型不明者亦受創傷。</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　首里北方戰綫，敵美曾於十九日以來開始總攻擊，日軍全綫展開果敢之逖擊，截至二十三日，敵死傷達六千，予以痛快打擊，敵祗於西海岸地區稍有進展，其他至第六日（二十四日）終於攻勢大挫，目下似在準備今後之攻擊。二十四日發生若千局部戰鬥，但不見敵之積極攻勢，十九·二十日敵之步兵力約由一萬減少至六千，戰車約九十輛，又對洋上之敵艦船，由於日軍特別攻擊隊之猛攻，戰勢愈形熾烈，予敵艦船羣甚大損害，而致敵之對冲繩本島艦砲射擊亦從之日益減少，殊為明瞭。當敵上陸開始時，一日平均超越七千發以上之敵艦砲射擊，至第二日（二十）日尙有五千五百發，二十一日為四千五百發，二十二日為三千發，至二十三日更激減為二千發。</p>
<h3>航空决戰再趨熾烈</h3>
<p>日海軍航空基地二十五日中央社電　最近數日來，冲繩戰塲發生幾點特異現象，第一，冲繩戰塲敵機動部隊已在後退，其目的不論為準備次期作戰，抑或整頓戰力，總之，冲繩海域已漸消失其踪跡。第二，冲繩四男敵艦船顯著減少，二十三日當時包括小數戰艦之艦船一百數十艘，主力集合於慶良間列島，其他分散於北中兩飛機傷海面以及名護灣，嘉手納海面，此當然為日軍不斷猛烈攻擊之結果，使敵受慘重損害所致。但敵方似已完成預期接濟目標，敵方近以基地航空兵力代替機動部隊，企圖轟炸日軍前進基地，二十一，二兩日，自馬里亞納基地飛來B29機一百數十架，致雙方航空基地決戰再趨熾烈，冲繩之敵飛機塲已集合有F6F，F4V小型艦上機，P38，P51長距離戰鬥機，B24轟炸機，P51夜間戰鬥機等共計約近二百架，又在慶良間列島集中大批哨戒機TBU　飛行艇等，與硫黃鳥之P51，P38互相策應，企圖覆滅日方基地航空兵力，但敵方決不能無限制使用航空兵力，此可根據過去事實而明瞭。敵機未曾來襲小笠原羣島，此亦可證明敵方向日軍基地挑戰已盡其最大力量，敵方喪失大批艦船機動部隊，猶以推進航空基地企圖侵攻本土，故冲繩作戰實為敵方最感困苦之作戰。</p>
<p>南方某日軍基地二十五日中央社電　日軍開始總攻擊冲繩四周敵艦船後，特攻隊海軍飛機為制止敵軍登陸行動，於二十·二十一兩日夜襲北飛機場，即在飛行跑道附近，已確認受炸起火者有數處，敵軍於恐懼之餘，最近在該飛機塲集合P38·P47·P51陶格拉斯型小型機百架，以協助掩護艦船行動，但經此次夜襲，其力量又顯見低弱，當夜襲時該機塲高射砲火極為稀少，且無探照燈光，僅有少數夜間戰鬥機追擊而已。</p>
<p>冲繩一月來　日軍戰果</p>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電冲　繩日軍一月來戰果，敵美自三月二十五日於慶良間列島以一部兵力登陸，開始冲繩本島侵寇作戰以來，瞬已月餘，四月一日午後十時以來，敵自冲繩本島西南部北谷附近至殘波岬十二公里之山面門，分數處以主力開始登陸作戰，而養精蓄銳待機中之日軍守備部隊，即施行果敢反擊，於海岸邀擊予敵相當損書，敵乃執擊於上陸地點，圖增强兵力，至同日傍晚，其兵力已增至二個師團內外，敵於二日畫間，即進出於嘉手納方面，三日自北谷南方經島袋進出於東海岸及泡瀨附近，至八日敵之第一錢已侵入至津覇，大山谷南側達至嘉敷附近，於此期間日軍部隊連日連夜果敢挺身反覆突擊，敵十陸迄七日止，殺傷人員約三千〇六名，戰車擱坐者一百〇三輛，並予各種火砲之破壞，七日敵更於北方方面名護灣以兵力五千，戰車一百三十輛强行登陸，戰鬥漸次進入激烈化。對此日軍於十日夜起南部全綫敢行壯烈白刃戰，予敵極太打擊，上陸以來，迄十一日止，經查明戰果，殺傷人員約六千三百名，戰車。裝甲軍擱坐起火燃燒達一百八十五輛，破毀自動貨軍四十八輛，自十二日夕，再度步砲密切協同之下大舉反攻，粉碎敵之攻勢企圖，截至十五日止，更加上殺傷人員一千七百名，此後敵更積極增强兵力，本島南部地區二個師團，本部半鳥方面一個師團，慶良間，伊江島及其他島嶼約一個師團，計總兵力上陸六個師團，推進火砲及軍需品前進，一方擴充整備北中兩飛機塲，企圖挽因態勢，以必死努力傾注該方戰局，遂於十九日晟來於本島雨部地區，以步兵約一萬之兵力及戰車數十輛開始全面攻擊。對此敵攻擊，日軍駐在部隊二十日夜決行夜襲，擊退其大部分，確保第一綫，繼續奮戰，十九日至二十三日正午，予敵之損害，殺傷人員約六千，破毀擱坐戰車八十輛，破壞火砲達十一尊，因此，該方面之敵兵力激減至五千六百，戰車亦減至九十輛，二十四日來仍在再度集結兵力資材，準備次期攻勢，而日軍以寡兵邀擊六個師團餘之登陸敵軍，善謀勇戰，堅持一個月，已殺敵兵一萬四千名，破壞戰車，自動貨車三百十三輛，毀滅火砲四十四門，更予其他相當損害。</p>
<p>南京通訊</p>
<h3>首都公務員的生活</h3>
<p>— 人平</p>
<p>公務員最多的地方要算南京了。南京是全國政治的中心，是首都的所在地，文武機關林立，上自國府五院各部會，下迄附屬小機關，以至旁枝的奮鬥，大小有數十個，因此公務員的數目很多。在他們中，有的自從民國十六年北伐遷都已在宦海之中浮沉着，其確實人數，最近也沒有精確的的統計，全市的在職公務員已有二萬九千七百六十八人，佔全市人口的百分之二强，目前的數量當然略有增減，但也相差不遠。</p>
<p>含辛茹苦的生活</p>
<p>公務員在戰前，一樣的拿着薪水過活，却可以稱天之驕子，因為他們所得的待遇優，所過的生活舒適，成為都市有力的消費者；但在目前的生活高壓下，一變成為各業中最不能消費的一種人了，他們的生活是含辛茹苦的，為了一家數口的生活，時常在徬徨着，簡直沒有餘力來和生活的高潮搏鬥，他們的生活實在是値得同情的。</p>
<p>他們的位置，也常缺少保障，上峯一有調動，時常全部更動，因此一部分人便不得不效狡兎之營三窟，其苦衷決非局外人所能想像到的。</p>
<p>歷年月俸之增加</p>
<p>生活程度一年一年的往上漲，當局也一年一年的盡力把薪俸提高，但是所提高的却有限度，決不能和無限度的物價並駕齊驅。一直沿用的官俸表，是民國廿三年度修正的，自最高級選任一千二百元至最低級委任五十五元止。近年來因受物價的影響也增加了幾次的津貼，第一次在卅一年首次增加選特任二成簡任四成薦任六成委任八成的臨時加成。卅二年度中，又增加了同樣的二次二四六八成。到了卅三年一月，除此以外，又加了照原俸的二，三，四，五倍。同年五月再加了一次薪津二分之一的特種津貼，但是非直屬行政院的各部附屬機關祗加二分之一。同年七月，取消了以前的加成，重行調整變成了九，十，十二，十四倍的臨時津貼，但是特種津貼還是加發的。同時實行佳月每人發給收費的俸米，實行後的第二個月，就因故折發現金。到了本年一月份的官俸改善，乃是最近一次的調整了，就是改為選任除原俸額外最高級加五萬元，特任加四萬元，簡任最高級加三萬三千元每級遞減一千五百元，薦任最高級加二萬二千元，每級　減一千元，委任最高級加一萬二千元，每級遞減八百元至九級以後每級遞減三百元。上項的臨時津貼還是照前額併發。同時俸來也改了三斗實物，三斗折發現金，折金的數量，也提高至差近實際米價。國府全部的文武官俸津貼，據說目前月達十四萬萬餘元之數。</p>
<p>最低的生活費用</p>
<p>公務員所得的待遇，究竟能不能維持他一家的最低限度的生活呢？這是當前回答不出的第一個疑問。如果他們所得的確實不能應付生活的時候，那末他們又如何在挨着過日的呢？這是回答不出的第二個疑問。</p>
<p>我們現在可以把南京生活必需品的各種價格，每一公務員以一家三口計算，（當然不至此數的多）每月最抵所需，可以列成下表：</p>
<p>（米）三斗（加俸米三斗合成六斗）每石四萬元計一萬二千元</p>
<p>（柴）二百斤每百斤四千元計八千元</p>
<p>（菜）每天以五百元計一萬五千元</p>
<p>（油）（連共他調味品在內）一千元</p>
<p>（維）（包括房金水電等項）一千元</p>
<p>合計三萬七千元</p>
<p>以上所列，都是最低的數目，實際當不止此數，何况還有其他的零星支出，但是已經要三萬七千元了。不過我們一看委任官最高的月俸連同津貼一起不過一萬五千元，就是再加了三斗米的折價約一萬元，也和上開的數目相距還遠；何况最低級的委任官還祗不過僅僅的拿四千三百二十五元呢？實在還不如一個勞工的收入。即使是最高級的選任官，一月却也不過六萬一千元而己！他們究竟還是選任官，還够應付，其他簡薦委任便都沒有辦法去應付目前的生活了。</p>
<p>公務員的生活，如此淸苦，要使不安分的不走上貪污舞弊之路，肅正官箴，增加行政效率，惟有待於官俸的提高，至於怎樣去提高，則有賴於當局者的如何策劃了。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>保衛琉球</h3>
<p>琉球羣島方面的戰局，以冲繩本島攻防激戰為中心而劇烈展開，戰爭的劇烈，可調在太平洋上為第一次，其戰略意義的重要，可從下列三點可以充分證明：第一，目前敵方派赴琉球方面的兵力，以機動部隊為主幹，而配以太平洋方面軍的精銳，成為集中的大部隊，這都是敵美一向視如生命的基幹部隊；第二，敵英的主力軍可能調集參加作戰，第三，盟方鑒於敵方此種孤注一擲的傾師來犯，為不失良機予以殲滅的打擊計，也有出動精銳參加作戰的實際趨勢。所以這次琉球之戰，將是生死存亡關頭的大決戰。</p>
<p>敵方為什麼在戰略上選擇琉球羣島展開火決戰呢？依據軍事專家的觀察，其動機不外如此。即第一，敵方的主要戰略月標為在琉球羣島建立强大的航空基地，妄圖對日本本土的西半部，掌握制空權，使配合馬利亞納敵基地結日本本土東半部的制空權。第二，爭取疏球羣島的海空軍基地，進一步取得對中國東海的制空權和制海權，一方而企圖切斷台灣及南洋對日本本土的連絡，更肆脅中日滿三國間的海陸交通。第三，敵方已在馬利亞納，呂宋島，琉黃島建立包圍日本本土的三個據點，再乃進而奪取琉球基地，以圖完成東南西三面包圍日本本土的戰略形勢，那時便有東向九州西向中國沿海推進侵入作戰。</p>
<p>然而，敵方這種戰略企圖在實踐中已經遭受到日本特攻部隊的嚴重打擊。敵方最重要的失敗；第一，是由於盟軍特攻部隊强有力的迎戰，不得不集中其最精銳部隊於冲繩本島方面，因而不能向日本本土共他方面侵犯，使盟方能充分完整防禦陣勢及從容活用其兵力。第二，菲律賓方面的盟軍繼續堅持作戰，分散和削弱敵方側翼的兵力，不能對台灣及中國沿海加强擾亂。第三，中國大陸方面的盟軍繼續挺進，這樣一面牽制住敵方大量的空軍及其他兵力，一面也使侵攻琉球的敵方士氣受到打擊。</p>
<p>特別値得注意的，盟邦軍事當局，對於迎擊敵軍侵犯本土，早巳佈置完成殲滅敵人的決戰態勢。盟方所期待着的，敵人如對某一戰役集中其最大限度的兵力，然後可以一舉予以致命的殲滅。現在敵方旣以主力都隊企圖從琉球衝入日本本土，那末，就是盟軍予以殲滅的一個機會。其結果，不僅擺毀了對日航空包圍陣的一角，並且將一舉而奪還西部太平洋的制空權和制海權。正如盟邦日本陸海兩相前在議會的聲明，即將轉為大反攻的機會。因此，盟軍在這次琉球之戰中，必能充分發揮以往日本海海的威力，達成殲敵的目的。現在盟軍的精銳，正代表着一億國民的同仇敵愾情緒，充溢着戰鬥意志，以特別攻擊隊自我犧牲的偉大精神，全體對敵拼撞，這是大東亞戰爭的最後勝利的有力保證。我們東亞人民，凜於戰局的嚴重，當以加倍的信心，努力本位工作，期待未來的捷報。</p>
<h3>慶良間島敵艦　擊沉毀九艘　日特攻隊連續告捷</h3>

<h3>Japanese Troops Firmly Defend the First Line of Defense, Fiercely Fighting in Southern Okinawa, Naval Attack Aircraft Continue Intense Kamikaze Attacks</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's attacks in the southern area of Okinawa Island, specifically Kijima, have intensified since the 23rd. The areas of Uebaru, 1.5 kilometers west of Tsutaba, and Sakibaru, 1 kilometer south of Geku, are experiencing the most intense fighting. Enemy forces, numbering over a thousand, accompanied by a dozen tanks, are closing in on Japanese positions. However, Japanese troops are firmly defending the first line of defense and fighting fiercely. Furthermore, the enemy's movements one kilometer west of Tobe Yama Kashiki are less vigorous than those east of that location, suggesting they are diligently replenishing their forces and preparing for the next operation. From the start of the enemy's general offensive on the 19th until noon on the 23rd, the enemy's losses have been determined as follows: 6,000 soldiers killed or wounded, 80 tanks destroyed, 11 artillery pieces destroyed, 4 supply depots destroyed, 2 mortars captured, 36 heavy and light machine guns captured, 1 anti-aircraft gun captured, 2 anti-tank rapid-firing guns captured. In addition, a large number of vehicles, weapons, ammunition, and other items were destroyed. Moreover, the attacks by Japanese naval special attack aircraft continue to be fierce. It has been confirmed that the results of the kamikaze attacks on the 22nd include the sinking or severe damage of two enemy aircraft carriers and ten battleships, cruisers, and large vessels. In addition, several vessels of unidentified type have also been damaged.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - On the Northern Shuri Front, enemy forces, including American troops, launched a general offensive beginning on the 19th. Japanese troops mounted a courageous defense along the entire line, inflicting a severe blow, with enemy casualties reaching 6,000 by the 23rd. The enemy only made some progress in the western coastal area. The offensive largely faltered by the 6th day (24th), and they currently appear to be preparing for future attacks. Several localized battles occurred on the 24th, but no active enemy offensive was observed. From the 19th to the 20th, the enemy's infantry strength decreased from approximately 10,000 to 6,000, and the number of tanks decreased to approximately 90. Moreover, the fierce attacks by the Japanese special attack units against enemy warships at sea have inflicted great damage on the enemy fleet, leading to a noticeable decrease in enemy naval bombardment of Okinawa Island. When the enemy landed, the average daily bombardment exceeded 7,000 rounds. This decreased to 5,500 rounds on the second day (20th), 4,500 rounds on the 21st, 3,000 rounds on the 22nd, and further reduced sharply to 2,000 rounds on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Air Battle Intensifies Again</h3>
<p>Japanese Naval Air Base, 25th (Central News Agency) - In recent days, several unusual phenomena have occurred on the Okinawa battlefield. First, the enemy's mobile task force on the Okinawa battlefield has retreated. Regardless of whether the purpose is to prepare for the next operation or to reorganize its strength, its presence in the Okinawa Sea has gradually disappeared. Second, the number of enemy warships off Okinawa has decreased significantly. As of the 23rd, there were about 150 warships, including a small number of battleships, mainly concentrated in the Kerama Islands, with others scattered in the seas off the northern and central airfields and in Nago Bay and Kadena Bay. This is undoubtedly the result of continuous and fierce Japanese attacks, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. However, the enemy seems to have completed its planned supply objective. The enemy is now attempting to bomb Japanese forward bases, replacing its mobile task force with land-based air power. On the 21st and 22nd, over a hundred B-29 aircraft flew from bases in the Mariana Islands, causing the air battle over the air bases of both sides to intensify again. The enemy airfield in Okinawa has gathered approximately 200 aircraft, including F6F and F4V carrier-based fighters, P-38 and P-51 long-range fighters, B-24 bombers, and P-51 night fighters. In addition, a large number of patrol aircraft TBU and flying boats are concentrated in the Kerama Islands, coordinating with the P-51 and P-38 aircraft from Iwo Jima, attempting to destroy Japanese land-based air power. However, the enemy cannot use air power without limitations. This can be understood based on past facts. The enemy aircraft have not attacked the Ogasawara Islands, which also proves that the enemy has exhausted its greatest strength in challenging the Japanese bases. The enemy has lost a large number of warships and mobile task forces, and is still attempting to invade the mainland by advancing air bases. Therefore, the Okinawa operation is the most difficult operation for the enemy.</p>
<p>Southern Japanese Base, 25th (Central News Agency) - After Japanese forces began a general offensive against enemy warships around Okinawa, special attack naval aircraft, to prevent the enemy's landing operation, conducted night raids on the northern airfield on the 20th and 21st. Several fires were confirmed near the runways. As a result of fear, the enemy recently gathered a hundred P-38, P-47, and P-51 Douglas-type small aircraft at that airfield to help cover the warships. However, after this night raid, their strength was visibly weakened. During the night raid, the anti-aircraft fire at the airfield was extremely sparse, and there were no searchlights, only a few night fighters in pursuit.</p>
<p>Okinawa: One Month of Japanese Military Achievements</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - It has been over a month since enemy American forces landed a portion of their troops on the Kerama Islands on March 25th and began the invasion operation on Okinawa Island. Since 10:00 PM on April 1st, the enemy began landing operations with the main force at several points on the 12-kilometer mountain front from the vicinity of Kitatani in the southwest of Okinawa Island to Zanpa Cape. The Japanese garrison troops, who had been conserving their strength and awaiting the opportunity, immediately launched a courageous counterattack, inflicting considerable losses on the enemy in the coastal defense. The enemy persisted in landing, attempting to increase its strength. By evening of the same day, its strength had increased to around two divisions. On the 2nd, the enemy advanced towards Kadena during the day. On the 3rd, it advanced from south of Kitatani through Shimabukuro to the east coast and the vicinity of Awase. By the 8th, the enemy's front line had penetrated to Tsuta and the southern side of Mt. Oyama, reaching the vicinity of Kashiki. During this period, Japanese troops launched courageous and repeated attacks day and night. By the 7th, the enemy had suffered approximately 3,006 casualties and 103 tanks were immobilized. In addition, various artillery pieces were destroyed. On the 7th, the enemy further landed 5,000 troops and 130 tanks in Nago Bay in the northern area, and the battle gradually intensified. In response, Japanese troops launched a fierce bayonet charge on the southern front from the night of the 10th, inflicting a major blow on the enemy. Up to the 11th since the landing, the confirmed battle results were approximately 6,300 casualties and 185 tanks and armored vehicles immobilized and set on fire, as well as 48 destroyed motorized vehicles. From the evening of the 12th, another large-scale counteroffensive was launched in close cooperation between infantry and artillery, thwarting the enemy's offensive intentions. As of the 15th, an additional 1,700 enemy troops were killed or wounded. After this, the enemy actively increased its strength, landing a total of six divisions: two divisions in the southern part of the island, one division in the Motobu Peninsula, and approximately one division in the Kerama, Ie Island, and other islands. The enemy pushed artillery and supplies forward and expanded and improved the northern and central airfields, attempting to reverse the situation with a desperate effort focused on that battle. Therefore, on the 19th, the enemy began a full-scale attack with approximately 10,000 infantry and dozens of tanks in the western part of the island. In response to this enemy attack, Japanese troops stationed in the area launched a night raid on the 20th, repelling most of the enemy and securing the first line, continuing to fight fiercely. From the 19th to noon on the 23rd, the enemy suffered approximately 6,000 casualties, 80 destroyed and immobilized tanks, and 11 destroyed artillery pieces. As a result, the enemy's strength in that area was drastically reduced to 5,600 troops, and the number of tanks was also reduced to 90.

<h3>The Life of Civil Servants in the Capital</h3>
<p>— By Ren Ping</p>
<p>The place with the most civil servants is Nanjing. Nanjing is the political center of the country, the location of the capital. There is a forest of civil and military organizations, from the five Yuans and various ministries of the National Government to the affiliated small organizations, and even peripheral efforts. There are dozens of them, large and small. Therefore, the number of civil servants is very large. Among them, some have been floating in the officialdom since the Northern Expedition moved the capital in the sixteenth year of the Republic. There is no accurate statistic of the exact number recently. There are 29,768 civil servants in the city, accounting for more than 2% of the city's population. The current number has certainly increased or decreased slightly, but not by much.</p>
<p>A Life of Hardship</p>
<p>Before the war, civil servants lived on their salaries like everyone else, but they could be called the darlings of heaven, because the treatment they received was excellent, the life they lived was comfortable, and they became powerful consumers in the city. But under the current high pressure of life, they have become one of the least able to consume in various industries. Their lives are full of hardship. They are often in a state of bewilderment for the life of a family of several people. They simply have no spare strength to fight the high tide of life. Their lives are really worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>Their positions also often lack security. When the superiors make a transfer, they often change completely. Therefore, some people have to imitate the cunning rabbit and build three burrows. Their difficulties are definitely not something outsiders can imagine.</p>
<p>Monthly Salary Increases Over the Years</p>
<p>The cost of living has been rising year by year, and the authorities have also been trying their best to increase salaries year by year, but the increase is limited and can never keep pace with the unlimited prices. The official salary table that has been used all along was revised in the 23rd year of the Republic. From the highest-level selection and appointment of 1,200 yuan to the lowest-level assignment of 55 yuan. In recent years, due to the impact of prices, there have been several increases in subsidies. The first time was in the 31st year when a temporary increase of 20% for the selected and specially appointed, 40% for the simplified appointed, 60% for the recommended appointed, and 80% for the commissioned appointed. In the 32nd year, the same two, four, six, and eight increases were added. In January of the 33rd year, in addition to this, two, three, four, and five times the original salary were added. In May of the same year, a special subsidy of one-half of the salary was added again, but the affiliated institutions of various ministries not directly under the Executive Yuan only added one-half. In July of the same year, the previous increases were cancelled and re-adjusted into temporary subsidies of nine, ten, twelve, and fourteen times, but the special subsidies were still issued. At the same time, each person was given subsidized rice every good month. In the second month after the implementation, it was converted into cash due to some reason. The official salary improvement in January of this year was the most recent adjustment, that is, the selection and appointment were changed to adding 50,000 yuan to the highest level in addition to the original salary amount, 40,000 yuan for special appointments, and 33,000 yuan for the highest level of simplified appointments, with a decrease of 1,500 yuan for each level. 22,000 yuan was added to the highest level of recommended appointment, with a decrease of 1,000 yuan for each level, 12,000 yuan was added to the highest level of commissioned appointment, with a decrease of 800 yuan for each level until after the ninth level, with a decrease of 300 yuan for each level. The above-mentioned temporary subsidies are still issued together at the previous amount. At the same time, the salary was also changed to three pecks of actual goods, and three pecks were converted into cash. The amount of cash conversion was also increased to almost the actual rice price. It is said that the total monthly salary subsidy for all civil and military officials of the National Government is currently more than 140 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Lowest Cost of Living</p>
<p>Can the treatment civil servants receive really maintain the minimum living expenses of his family? This is the first question that cannot be answered at present. If what they receive is indeed not enough to cope with life, then how are they getting by? This is the second question that cannot be answered.</p>
<p>We can now list the various prices of daily necessities in Nanjing, calculated for each civil servant with a family of three (of course, many are not this number). The most necessary amount each month can be listed in the table below:</p>
<p>(Rice) Three pecks (combined with three pecks of subsidized rice to make six pecks) Calculated at 40,000 yuan per stone 12,000 yuan</p>
<p>(Firewood) 200 catties Calculated at 4,000 yuan per 100 catties 8,000 yuan</p>
<p>(Vegetables) Calculated at 500 yuan per day 15,000 yuan</p>
<p>(Oil) (Including other seasonings) 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>(Maintenance) (Including rent, water and electricity, etc.) 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total 37,000 yuan</p>
<p>The above are all the minimum amounts, and the actual amount should be more than this. What's more, there are other odd expenses, but it already costs 37,000 yuan. However, when we look at the highest monthly salary of a commissioned official, including subsidies, it is only 15,000 yuan. Even if we add the converted price of three pecks of rice, which is about 10,000 yuan, it is still far from the above amount. What's more, the lowest-level commissioned official only gets 4,325 yuan? It is really not as good as the income of a laborer. Even the highest-level elected official only gets 61,000 yuan a month! They are still elected officials and can still cope, but other simplified recommendations and commissions have no way to cope with the current life.</p>
<p>The life of civil servants is so difficult. To prevent the restless from taking the road of corruption and bribery, and to rectify officialdom and increase administrative efficiency, we can only wait for the increase in official salaries. As for how to increase it, it depends on how the authorities plan it.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Defend the Ryukyus</h3>
<p>The battle situation in the Ryukyu Islands, with the fierce battle for the defense of Okinawa Island as its center, is unfolding dramatically. The intensity of the war can be said to be the first in the Pacific, and the importance of its strategic significance can be fully demonstrated from the following three points: First, the forces currently dispatched by the enemy to the Ryukyus are mainly composed of mobile units, supplemented by the elite of the Pacific forces, forming a concentrated large force. These are all base units that the enemy Americans have always regarded as life. Second, the main force of the enemy British may be mobilized to participate in the battle. Third, in view of the enemy's all-or-nothing approach, the Allies also have the actual tendency to dispatch elite forces to participate in the battle in order to seize the opportunity to give them a crushing blow. Therefore, this battle of the Ryukyus will be a decisive battle at the critical moment of life and death.</p>
<p>Why did the enemy strategically choose the Ryukyu Islands to launch a decisive battle? According to the observations of military experts, their motives are nothing more than this. That is, first, the enemy's main strategic goal is to establish a strong air base in the Ryukyu Islands, attempting to gain air supremacy over the western half of the Japanese mainland, so that it can cooperate with the enemy base in the Mariana Islands to control the air supremacy in the eastern half of the Japanese mainland. Second, striving for the air and naval bases in the Sugashima Islands will further gain control of the air and sea in the East China Sea. On the one hand, they attempt to cut off the connection between Taiwan and the South Seas to the Japanese mainland, and even more肆胁 the sea and land transportation between China, Japan, and Manchuria. Third, the enemy has established three strongholds surrounding the Japanese mainland in the Mariana Islands, Luzon Island, and Ryukyu Island. They will then advance to seize the Ryukyu base in an attempt to complete the strategic situation of surrounding the Japanese mainland on the east, south, and west sides. At that time, they will advance eastward to Kyushu and westward to the Chinese coast to carry out invasion operations.</p>
<p>However, the enemy's strategic attempt has already suffered a serious blow from the Japanese special attack force in practice. The most important failure of the enemy: First, due to the powerful resistance of the Allied special attack force, they had to concentrate their most elite forces in the Okinawa Island area, and therefore could not invade the Japanese mainland in other areas, so that the Allies could fully and completely defend their defenses and use their forces at leisure. Second, the Allied forces in the Philippines continue to persist in the battle, dispersing and weakening the enemy's flanking forces, and cannot strengthen disturbances in Taiwan and the Chinese coast. Third, the Allied forces on the Chinese mainland continue to advance, which on the one hand contains a large number of enemy air forces and other forces, and on the other hand, also hits the morale of the enemy invading the Ryukyus.</p>
<p>What is particularly noteworthy is that the Allied military authorities have already completed the decisive battle posture to annihilate the enemy in order to counter the enemy's invasion of the mainland. What the Allies are looking forward to is that if the enemy concentrates its maximum force on a certain battle, then it can give it a fatal annihilation in one fell swoop. Now that the enemy has attempted to break into the Japanese mainland from the Ryukyus with its main forces, then it is an opportunity for the Allies to annihilate them. As a result, not only will a corner of the air encirclement of Japan be destroyed, but the air and sea supremacy in the western Pacific will be regained in one fell swoop. Just as the Japanese army and navy of the Allies declared in the parliament, the opportunity for a major counteroffensive is about to turn. Therefore, in this battle of the Ryukyus, the Allies will surely be able to fully exert the power of the Japanese navy in the past and achieve the goal of annihilating the enemy. Now the elite of the Allies is representing the common hatred of the enemy of the 100 million people of the country, full of fighting will, and with the great spirit of self-sacrifice of the special attack force, the whole body is engaged in a collision with the enemy. This is a powerful guarantee for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. We, the people of East Asia, are awed by the seriousness of the battle situation, and we must redouble our confidence and work hard in our own positions, looking forward to future good news.</p>

<p>Crackdown Should be Increased on Prices Exceeding Limits</p>
<p>Recently, commodity prices in this city have been stimulated by financial fluctuations and have risen sharply.

However, the retail prices of other businesses have not been clearly marked and sold at the official prices, and some businesses are even selling key commodities at prices exceeding the limits set by the Municipal Economic Bureau. Such merchants who outwardly comply but inwardly defy the regulations are harming the livelihood of citizens, and should be severely punished. The Municipal Economic Bureau should strictly enforce the new price limits for key commodities and crack down on sales exceeding those limits.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary: No More Hesitation; Pay Attention to Public Associations That Have Not Paid for Relief Bonds</p>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city has issued 1.5 billion yuan of temporary relief...[illegible character]...bonds, of which 450 million yuan is to be undertaken by various trade associations. At a tea party on March 17, the municipal government invited the responsible persons of each trade association to clarify the purpose and, through the joint decision of the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, determined the grade of each trade association and allocated the number of subscriptions according to the grade, with a deadline for payment at the end of March. However, according to the list of trade associations that have subscribed and the amounts published today, only about 40% of the target has been reached. A large number of trade associations have not paid within the deadline, and now that the time has passed...[illegible character]...month, these trade associations have still not paid, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The purpose of the municipal relief...[illegible character]...bonds is to carry out public welfare undertakings for the citizens of this city. Members of all trade associations are members of the industrial and commercial circles of this city and have the obligation to contribute money and effort to the public welfare undertakings of this city. The Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have determined the grade of the trade associations based on objective grounds, and will not...[illegible character]...exceed the ability of each trade association to bear the cost. The fact that some trade associations have complied with the deadline is commendable, while the fact that some trade associations are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and have not...[illegible character]...paid within the stipulated time shows that the persons in charge of the trade associations have clearly failed to fulfill their responsibility to supervise. We hope that the persons in charge of these trade associations will promptly take responsibility for urging payment and remit the full amount as soon as possible, in order to conclude the matter...[illegible character]...avoid controversy.</p>
<p>Spring Business Tax: Three Industries Exempted or Granted Reduced Rates; Payment Deadline is End of Month</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau is collecting the spring business tax for this year in this city. Various industries have already reported and paid their taxes, and the deadline is the end of this month.

<p>*   The Sugar Industry Association requested that the business tax for the assigned quotas of rationed sugar handled by each firm be waived, and permission has been granted to collect half the original tax rate.</p>
<p>*   The Silk Factory Association, with the approval of the Bureau, has already paid a special silk tax...[illegible characters]...and is exempt from business tax. However, if silk businesses establish...[illegible characters]...for promotion and sales, they should still be taxed business tax.</p>
<p>*   The Incense and Candle Industry, because they have already paid capital tax, requested that they no longer be...[illegible character]...charged ordinary business tax. The Bureau has approved the exemption from business tax for those exclusively engaged in the incense...[illegible character]...business that have already paid the incense and candle capital tax,...[illegible character]...those engaged in...[illegible character]...other businesses must still...[illegible character]...report and pay taxes.</p>
<p>Social Service Commemorative Donation for Quitting Gambling for Charity School</p>
<p>...[illegible character]...Mr. Pan Zhenhai wrote a letter stating: "The trend of gambling in Shanghai has always been very...[illegible character]...rampant. In the past, gambling...[illegible characters]...were everywhere, but now people gather in private homes and gamble thousands of gold, without any hesitation, while they turn a blind eye to charitable undertakings. Although they see that the...[illegible character]...poor are increasing day by day and the number of children dropping out of school is increasing day by day, they have never offered a helping hand to assist. In the past, I was deeply addicted to gambling and could not properly manage my business. Last year, I deeply...[illegible character]...repented and decided to quit, and it has been a year now. Now, seeing that your newspaper is establishing a charity school with good intentions and benefiting society and the country,...[illegible character]...I am donating 10,000 yuan to support a...[illegible character]...student" as a first anniversary of quitting gambling. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is only a token of my appreciation, and I hope to encourage those who are still...[illegible character]...gambling."</p>
