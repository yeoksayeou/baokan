<h3>爲大東亞建立和平　日本決奮鬥到底　對國府米糧施策竭力協助</h3>
<p>谷大使發表談話</p>
<p>中央社訊　日本特命全　駐華大使谷正之氏，六月三十日下午五時四十分在上海外　百老滙大樓接見本市各報記者，詳答所詢各問題如次：</p>
<p>從戰爭中獲致勝利</p>
<p>問：際此戰爭　入決戰階段，中·日應如何密切合作，獲取勝利？</p>
<p>答：凡事欲謀合作，不論其合作性質如何，祗須合作之當事人具有眞實之理念，則其合作性益有意義。現大東亞已至決戰階段，亦可謂爲歐戰以後之重要情勢，詎美。英竟意圖夷大東亞爲其殖民地。查此次戰爭，日本爲求東亞各國政治上平等，經濟上互惠，文化上互相尊重固有之文化，並保全各國之主權，此即日本戰爭之目的，亦即爲大東亞戰爭之目的。日本爲達成此種信念而奮鬬，日本民族具此特殊信念，決奮戰到底，故此戰蓋爲大東亞而戰，並非爲侵略而戰，從戰爭中自可獲致勝利，然此勝利，乃大東亞建立和平之勝利，此乃本人所感覺者。</p>
<p>對舊金山會議觀感</p>
<p>問：大使對於舊金山會議所產生之所謂「國際安全機構」觀感如何？</p>
<p>答：關於舊金山會議之國際安全機構，與過去第一次歐戰後所產生之國際聯盟，可謂異曲同工，其重要性僅爲達到大國之專制，否認小國之立場與利益。因此種種關係，不惜出以各種手段與方法，保障其思想中之慾望，而即產生此種機構，換言之，此機構在開始時即充滿不平之現象，雖然山會議討論而成，但如發生國際間問題，而欲運用解決之，其行動及意見決難達到一致，此亦不難想像者。此爲過去國際聯盟無用之證明，而今再有此同樣組織，即可表明各該國政治家思想之毫無進步性，其企圖爲支配世界，乃爲人類最不幸之事，故該機構決不能保隙世界和平。換言之，各國應諒解彼此立塲，即大國有環境，小國有立場，互相尊敬公正無私之立場，眞正發揮東亞精神，則世界方有救，各小闊方能有被拯救之一日</p>
<p>新榖登塲妥善方策</p>
<p>問：國府採取米　緊急措置後，貴國在華當局將協力至如何程度，並對今後新榖登塲時，有無新的統籌辦法？</p>
<p>答：國府對於米糧措施內容，曾經正式發表，其內容基爲精確，毫無缺憾，本人極爲欽佩。但最重要者，希望國府能排除萬難，以底於成，日本在華當局及大使館，亦經同時發表談話，對國府表示協力到底，至於新榖登塲，國府當局是否有新統籌方法，尚不得而知，　信國府於新榖登塲時，定能適應環境，有妥善方策，屆時日本當然仍予協力，此點爲本人所敢言者。</p>
<p>和平之門並未關閉</p>
<p>問：近來關於和平謠言甚多，大使對此有何見解，目前是否有和平途徑可循？</p>
<p>答：日本對和平之態度，早在中·日同盟條約及大東亞會議共同宣言中充分表明，最近鈴木首相對此亦有明自熊度表示，惟尚有人對日本之態度不暸解，然戰爭演變，自將引起彼　東亞休戚相共之自覺。如邇來之和平論之繁多，足　有眞正憂慮東亞前途者之存在，至於日本對於和平之門，並未關閉，但須觀對方願不願踏進和平之門，此乃爲重要之一點。</p>
<h3>新瀉空襲</h3>
<p>北海道擊毀一機</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　敵大型機約十架，二十九日下午十一時半，由茨城縣東方海上侵入新潟附近，一部於新潟港附近，另一部於酒田港投下機雷，三十日上午一時餘由平附近逸去。</p>
<p>札幌三十日中央社電　日北部軍管區司令部下午三時發表稱：本日正午左右，敵B29型機一架來襲北海道西南部地區，我軍當即迎擊，將其擊毀。</p>
<h3>日組成護國聯盟　幹部皆軍政名流　平沼男爵任協議會長小林長本部</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　際茲戰局重大化，基於擁護國體，實踐臣道，以推進倫理運動爲目的，小林省三郞氏現發起組成護國聯盟，已由內務大臣贊同，視爲一種刻已展開活潑之遝動。該聯盟爲各種團體及個人所組織，并不解散旣成團體，即由代表者參加，其機構於本部設置教化部及協議會，協議員爲參加團體代表者之要人個別結成。該聯盟之幹部名單如次：協議會長平沼騏一郞男爵，本部長小林省三郞，協議員眞崎甚三郞大將，本莊繁大將，野村吉三郞大將，南鄉次郞（請道館長），小倉正恒（中國國民政府顧間），連沼門三（修養團主幹）。</p>
<p>緊急措置委會昨午首次集議</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日政府首次戰時緊急措置委員會，於三十日下午一時，在首相官邸舉行，政府方面出席者有鈴木首相，廣瀨大藏相，豐田軍需相，小日山運輸相，迫水書記官長，利　法制局長官，秋永綜合計劃局長官等。首由鈴木首相致辭，詞即審議二十九日閣議所決定「關於戰時罹災土地物件之敕令案要綱」一案，迄四時餘散會。鈴木首相之致辭要旨如次：日政府爲期圓滿運用戰時緊急措置法，已設立戰時緊急措置委員會，預料視此後事態之演進，該法案將於各方面發展，深望諸君各盡職責，於此後充分協力。</p>
<h3>何應欽談戰局</h3>
<p>廣州三十日中央社電　據渝中央社電稱：駐渝美國記者於視察湘粵前綫後，二十七日赴昆明，謁見重慶陸空軍總司令官何應欽。何氏答覆記者之叩問，強調日軍之戰力，率直承認渝軍獨自反攻之困難，如不於中國大陸登陸作戰，則渝軍實不能獨力驅逐日軍，故美國必須增加軍器之供給。又日本土與中國大陸之交通，即使被完全切斷，中國之日軍仍必須繼續作戰，蓋此時日軍可利用滿洲國之資源云。</p>
<h3>敵美藉援渝名義　從事破壞中國　島田班長發表談話</h3>
<p>上海日本陸軍部報道班長島田中佐，昨（三十日）午在報道常會席上，向本市新聞記者發表談話，如下：</p>
<p>渝方專恃美國援助</p>
<p>最近渝方輿論，對於總反攻一事，過分誇張，日方對此雖予注意，但對於渝政權之專恃美國援助，更表深切重視，藎事實上渝方並未獲得美國之眞正援助，美國僅藉援渝各義，積極從事破壞中國。蔣介石於本月二十八日連緻四日會見外國記者，發表稱受美國式訓練及有美國配備之渝軍，不久準備向日軍採取交戰態勢。如聯合軍直接登陸，則中國軍與在大陸之日軍作戰，並不感困難。計美在軍事上之協力，深感滿意，但希望對中國作更積極之經濟上援助。何應欽亦於二十五日會見外國記者時稱：如美軍在中國大陸登陸，深信必能戰敗日軍，惟爲求達到此日的起見，必須仰續美國之機械化配備，在準備上亦需要相當時期，淪軍之戰備，迄未完成。</p>
<p>國公關係完全破裂</p>
<p>在美國對渝強化援助，已促使國共關係完全決裂，此篇衆所周知者，根據六月二十六日延安新華社電報，表示中共決反對美帝國主義者之哈萊系，指稱彼輩企圖在中國確立獨裁極，以吸取中國人民汗血，對重度大加非難，預料如延安決定召集解放區人民代表會議，用以對抗十一月十二日渝方所召開之國民大會，則美國常將完全支持重慶。</p>
<p>企圖統制中國生產</p>
<p>最近美國設立中議戰區美軍司令部，在表面上由於作戰之必要，惟實際且的在準備開發中國工業，統制通貨與物價。過去美軍機關對統制運輸等等·均參與干涉，尤其以中國有關各種共產之美國實業家二十五名，謀在職後加强統一中國生產，於此可見美制　中國政治經濟基礎，已有相當程度。基上所述，美軍對中國之民衆，態度愈益囂張。據最近內地報紙稱：美軍以手槍向渝軍背後恫嚇，要來突擊，如有不願即被槍殺，因此內地言論界抨擊美軍頗甚，尤以向中國婦女暴行事件，益見激增。韋特曼爲避免此過甚之非難，特限制美國兵士外出，嚴禁調戲良家婦女，以及勒索姦淫，於此可見美軍跋扈之一斑。頃日軍在中國大陸擁有龐大軍事力量，倘美軍登陸，奄不畏　，惟美國勢力如深入中國，有引起渝軍之動向，則日本決意隨時加以打擊摧毀。</p>
<p>星期評論　雜糧與滬市民食　沈甫澄</p>
<p>今日的民食問題，就是最大的民生問題。民食問題不能得到合理的解決，就是民生的痛苦不能得到初步解除，自然談不到民生的安定了。求取民食問即的合理解決，從而初步解除民生的痛苦，固然是常局的重要任務；不過，在人民立塲，對於自身生活所繫的食糧，也應在自身力量可能解決的範圍以內，盡量設法解決，以期減輕整個民食問題的嚴重性，以期減輕整個民生痛苦的程度。更簡單的說，民食問題的解決，政府當局應負通盤籌劃的全面的責任，人民本身也應負適應環境的各別的責任。惟有這樣上下一致，配合一致，才能獲得合理的切實解決。否則，人民徒怨常局不爲設法解決，當局至多做到頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚的不澈底階段，於是，民食終成不可解決的問題，民生痛苦自然有增無已了。</p>
<p>至於上海的民食問題，實際上更不易解決。因爲上海本身旣不生產糧食，而上海人却又是非吃白米不可的納消耗者，大家都有非米不飯的觀念和習慣。近數年來，環境變遷，目前已經到了萬萬不能滿足上海人吃白米慾望的地步。如果上海人本身還是　執非米不飯的習慣，那末，只有挨餓或是楊腹了。如果富有者仗了有錢可以競購囤米，如果中產者仗了有些荐米可以消耗如故，如果　水階級也以爲張羅未窮，可以依然非米不飯，那末，只有促使米價再高，只有陷生活於更深的痛苦而已。</p>
<p>因此，我們上海市民，爲認識民食問題的現實情勢，必減少自身未來的痛苦，應該放棄非米不飯的觀念和習慣，就須盡最採用雜糧果腹，至少也頭搭吃雜糧。根據正確估計，目前來榖正在靑黃不接之期，而產米區之存米數量已不充分，僅數就地供應，縱能暢運來滬，數量旣不能如理想之大，但價格必將因成本增加大而高漲。而雜糧產地之雜糧存世，比較充沛，足以供給外地。因此，就米與雜糧之存量比較而言，在新榖登場之前，滬市民食非組雜糧補充不可。這是事實與環境的必然限制，我們不能不因勢適應，希望市民同胞首先認淸。</p>
<p>況且，米飯果腹與雜糧果腹，在口感上心理上或許稍有好惡，而在維持生存上是效率同等的。相反的，在營養價值上，則雜糧較優於白米，依據各種必需營養成份之分析比較，最豐富的是小米，其次是麥，復次是苞米，而最低者却是白米。所以，搭吃雜糧，不但不減少身體上所需的營養。反而有增加健康的可能。北方人終年吃麵和雜糧，身體反比南方吃米的人強健。筆者也來自產雜糧區，自幼以元麥與苞米果腹。極少疾病，來滬後改吃白米，反見體力柔弱。自信絕非過甚其辭。因此，從營養與健康而言，搭吃雜糧，反較有益。</p>
<p>總之，今後滬市民食之解決，旣非以雜組補充不可，市民應即自動改變習慣。同時，我們覺得雜糧價格之隨同米價比例上漲，在供應數量上言，毫無理由，完全是人爲的拉抬，當局應加注意抑制。另方面，向雜糧產地大量採辦運滬，平價配給，補充民食，調節民食，極爲必要，希望當局與民間有力人士共起籌劃，從速實施，則滬市民食問題，庶幾得以漸次解決。</p>

<h3>寶山與羅店</h3>
<p>— 馬駿良</p>
<p>寶山在上海市附近，戰前屬於江蘇省，事變後才劃歸上海市，初爲特別區，旋仍恢復縣治。這座蒼老的古城，戰前本極繁榮，乃事變時適在戰區之內，故縣城荒凉，斷　殘垣，慘不忍睹，街道景况，遠非昔比。</p>
<p>寶山農產</p>
<p>統計寶山全縣人口約有十萬零五千餘，該縣行政上，統轄着月浦·楊行·羅店·劉行·川沙·盛僑·顧村·陳行·廣福等市鎭，論治安市容，常以羅店爲最。寶山縣全境面積二十七萬畝，其中農田面積約佔半數，去年農產豐收異於鄰縣，現將去年之產量，作一統計：全縣稻作產量有二十五萬担餘，棉七萬担餘，麥三十餘萬担，莧麻約七百石之多。農村副業則　半以飼養家畜爲生，其次爲紡織土布，運銷於他縣者，亦不在少數。綜觀賽山農村經濟，正在向復興之途邁進。</p>
<p>首鎭羅店</p>
<p>羅店爲寶山首鎭，年來以鄕間治安不靖，紛紛遷來鎭上居住，故市容繁榮，人口稠密，商店櫛比，攤販林立，而滬地人士所投資創設之小型工廠，（紗，麵粉）更如雨後春筍。今日之羅店，正在步人戰時繁榮之境。</p>
<p>羅店有小學四所，初中一所。私立棉業小學，係當地棉花業公會主辦，校　皆爲當地富紳，校長　弈　服務教育界多年。私立豐樂小學，爲當地米雜糧公會主辦，校長臧式如。縣立羅店小學，本設於新村，現已遷至一座廟宙內，主持人楊籐驤。競秀小校，前該校校長爲程　，實際由馬鎔德女士主持，校譽蒸蒸日上。至於初中僅有羅溪中學。各校學生均有五六百人，其中以棉業學生爲最多，教員均由本鎭靑年担任，男女各半，程度不齊，甚至有連自己也沒有小學畢業的，以致笑話百出。</p>
<p>在米珠薪桂的今日，教師的生活尤屬淸苦，各校待遇較高的折合現市米價計算之（此乃私立學校縣立不然。）如棉小主任二斗二升，級任科任二斗一斗八升皆有，豐樂與棉小相伯仲，競秀則略遜一籌，最可憐者則爲縣立羅小，據說教師待遇，每月僅只三百三十元，照目前市價，辛苦教書一月只能買一只大餅。</p>
<p>該地鄉民，信教者甚多，皈依佛教不乏其人。最折鄉民又對一貫道趨之若鶩，所謂一貫，即爲鎔釋道儒三教於一爐，據說該教每逢初一月半，設壇講道，除這批虔誠的道友外，絕對禁止旁人參觀。教義奧秘，自謂信道者不吃流彈，刀槍不入，觀此頗類淸之白蓮教及無錫之先天道，煽惑人心其此爲甚，究其產生之背景，其情可　，然而長此令其蔓延，遺禍不堪設想。深望有關軍政當局，導之入於正軌，以過亂萌。</p>
<p>賭風熾烈</p>
<p>該地茶肆之設立，猶如雨後春筍，蓋以鄕民羣以茶肆爲賭博的塲所。在裏面混着的都是些地痞土棍，及九流三教的鄉曲，呼盧喝雉，通宵達旦。一局勝負，約有百萬金出入。輸者豪無吝色，這種孤注一擲的作風，據說司空見慣，因此傾家蕩產身敗名裂而自盡者，亦大有其人。公然聚賭，而軍警機關，竟視若無覩，使人發生種種疑問。</p>
<p>物價高昂</p>
<p>羅店物價之高，不亞於上海，白米曾經漲到過八十萬，鮮肉每斤四千元，菜蔬之類每斤竟達千元之鉅，日用品的價格更令人昨舌，這也許是非法的捐稅有以促成的。</p>

<h3>For the Establishment of Peace in Greater East Asia: Japan Determined to Fight to the End; Will Exert Utmost Efforts to Assist the National Government's Grain Policy</h3>
<p>Ambassador Tani Issues Statement</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Japanese Plenipotentiary Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, met with reporters from various Shanghai newspapers at the Broadway Mansions at 5:40 PM on June 30th, answering their questions in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Achieving Victory Through War</p>
<p>Question: Now that the war has entered a decisive stage, how should China and Japan cooperate closely to achieve victory?</p>
<p>Answer: In all matters seeking cooperation, regardless of the nature of the cooperation, as long as the parties involved have a genuine understanding, the cooperation will be more meaningful. Now, Greater East Asia has reached a decisive stage, which can also be said to be an important situation following the European War. The United States and Britain are actually intending to turn Greater East Asia into their colonies. This war, Japan seeks political equality, economic reciprocity, and mutual respect for inherent cultures among East Asian nations, as well as to preserve the sovereignty of each nation. This is the purpose of Japan's war, which is also the purpose of the Greater East Asia War. Japan is fighting to achieve this belief, and the Japanese nation has this special belief, and is determined to fight to the end. Therefore, this war is fought for Greater East Asia, not for aggression. Victory can naturally be achieved through war, but this victory is a victory for establishing peace in Greater East Asia. This is what I feel.</p>
<p>Impressions of the San Francisco Conference</p>
<p>Question: What are the Ambassador's impressions of the so-called "International Security Organization" produced by the San Francisco Conference?</p>
<p>Answer: The International Security Organization of the San Francisco Conference can be said to be similar to the League of Nations produced after the First European War. Its importance only lies in achieving the despotism of major powers and denying the positions and interests of small countries. Because of these relationships, they spare no effort to use various means and methods to safeguard the desires in their minds, and thus this organization is produced. In other words, this organization is filled with unfair phenomena from the beginning. Although it was discussed and formed at the San Francisco Conference, if international problems arise and it wants to use it to resolve them, its actions and opinions will be difficult to reach a consensus, which is not difficult to imagine. This is proof of the uselessness of the past League of Nations. Now that there is the same organization again, it can show that the politicians of each country have no progress in their thinking. Their attempt to dominate the world is the most unfortunate thing for mankind. Therefore, this organization cannot guarantee world peace. In other words, countries should understand each other's positions, that is, major countries have an environment, and small countries have a position, respecting each other's fair and selfless position, and truly promoting the spirit of East Asia, then the world can be saved, and small countries can have a day to be saved.</p>
<p>Sound Policies for the New Grain Harvest</p>
<p>Question: After the National Government takes emergency measures on rice, to what extent will your country's authorities in China cooperate? And will there be new unified plans when the new grain harvest comes onto the market in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: The National Government has formally announced the content of the rice policy, and its content is very accurate and without any shortcomings. I admire it very much. But the most important thing is to hope that the National Government can overcome all difficulties and succeed. The Japanese authorities in China and the Embassy have also issued statements expressing their full cooperation with the National Government. As for the new grain harvest, it is not yet known whether the National Government authorities have new unified methods. I believe that the National Government will be able to adapt to the environment and have sound policies when the new grain harvest comes onto the market. At that time, Japan will of course still provide cooperation. This is what I dare to say.</p>
<p>The Door to Peace is Not Closed</p>
<p>Question: There have been many rumors about peace recently. What is the Ambassador's view on this? Is there a path to peace that can be followed at present?</p>
<p>Answer: Japan's attitude towards peace has been fully stated in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Conference Joint Declaration. Recently, Prime Minister Suzuki has also made a clear statement on this matter. However, some people still do not understand Japan's attitude. However, the evolution of the war will naturally arouse their awareness that East Asia shares the same fate. The proliferation of peace talks in recent times is enough to show the existence of those who are truly worried about the future of East Asia. As for Japan, the door to peace has not been closed, but it must be observed whether the other party is willing to step into the door of peace. This is an important point.</p>
<h3>Niigata Air Raid</h3>

<h3>Japan Forms National Defense League: Leaders Are All Prominent Military and Political Figures; Baron Hiranuma Serves as Chairman of the Council, Kobayashi as Head of Headquarters</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch): At this time of intensifying war situation, based on the purpose of upholding the national polity, practicing the way of the subject, and promoting ethical movement, Mr. Kobayashi Shozaburo has now initiated the formation of the National Defense League, which has been approved by the Minister of Home Affairs, and is regarded as a kind of active movement that has been launched. The League is organized by various groups and individuals, and does not dissolve existing groups, but is formed by representatives participating.

The list of the League's executives is as follows: Chairman of the Council: Baron Hiranuma Kiichiro, Head of Headquarters: Kobayashi Shozaburo, Councilors: General Masaki Jinzaburo, General Honjo Shigeru, General Nomura Kichisaburo, Nango Jiro (President of the Kodokan), Ogura Masatsune (Advisor to the Chinese National Government), Renuma Monta (Mainstay of the Shuyo-dan).</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Discusses the War Situation</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch): According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing, after inspecting the Hunan-Guangdong front lines, American reporters stationed in Chongqing went to Kunming on the 27th to meet with General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Air Force in Chongqing. In response to the reporters' questions, Mr. He emphasized the Japanese army's combat power and frankly admitted the difficulty of the Chongqing army launching a counter-offensive on its own. If there is no landing operation on the Chinese mainland, the Chongqing army cannot independently drive out the Japanese army, so the United States must increase the supply of military equipment. Furthermore, even if the transportation between Japan and the Chinese mainland is completely cut off, the Japanese army in China must continue to fight, because the Japanese army can use the resources of Manchuria.</p>
<h3>Enemy America, Under the Pretext of Aiding Chongqing, is Engaged in Destroying China: Remarks by Section Chief Shimada</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Shimada, head of the press section of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, made a statement to newspaper reporters in the city at yesterday (30th)'s press conference, as follows:</p>
<p>The Chongqing Side Relies Solely on American Aid</p>
<p>Recently, the Chongqing side's public opinion has excessively exaggerated the matter of a general counter-offensive. Although the Japanese side is paying attention to this, it is paying even more attention to the fact that the Chongqing regime relies solely on American aid. In fact, the Chongqing side has not obtained genuine aid from the United States. The United States is only using various pretexts of aiding Chongqing to actively engage in destroying China. Chiang Kai-shek met with foreign reporters for four consecutive days on the 28th of this month and stated that the Chongqing army, trained in the American style and equipped with American equipment, is preparing to take a combat stance against the Japanese army soon. If the Allied forces land directly, the Chinese army will not feel any difficulty in fighting the Japanese army on the mainland. He feels deeply satisfied with the United States' cooperation in military affairs, but hopes for more active economic assistance to China. He Yingqin also said when meeting with foreign reporters on the 25th that if the American army lands on the Chinese mainland, he is convinced that the Japanese army will be defeated. However, in order to achieve this day, it is necessary to continue to rely on the American mechanization equipment, and considerable time is also needed in preparation. The Chongqing army's combat readiness has not yet been completed.</p>
<p>Relations Between the Nationalists and the Communists Have Completely Broken Down</p>
<p>That the United States' strengthened aid to Chongqing has completely broken relations between the Nationalists and the Communists is well known. According to a Xinhua News Agency telegram from Yan'an on June 26, the CCP decided to oppose the American imperialist clique of Hurley, claiming that they attempted to establish a dictatorship in China in order to extract the sweat and blood of the Chinese people, and greatly criticized Chongqing. It is expected that if Yan'an decides to convene a people's representative conference in the liberated areas to counter the National Congress convened by Chongqing on November 12, then the United States will always fully support Chongqing.</p>
<p>Attempting to Control China's Production</p>
<p>Recently, the United States established the U.S. Army Command in the China Theater. On the surface, it is due to the necessity of combat, but in reality, it is preparing to develop Chinese industry and control currency and prices. In the past, American military organs have been involved in interference in controlling transportation, etc. In particular, 25 American industrialists related to various communes in China are planning to strengthen the unification of Chinese production after taking office. From this, it can be seen that the American system has already had a considerable degree of political and economic foundation in China. Based on the above, the attitude of the American army towards the Chinese people is becoming more and more arrogant. According to recent mainland newspapers, the American army threatened the Chongqing army from behind with pistols to come and attack. If they were unwilling, they would be shot. Therefore, the mainland press is criticizing the American army quite a bit. In particular, incidents of violence against Chinese women have been increasing. In order to avoid this excessive criticism, Whitman has restricted American soldiers from going out, strictly prohibiting flirting with good women and extortion and rape. From this, the arrogance of the American army can be seen. Recently, the Japanese army has a large military force on the Chinese mainland. Even if the American army lands, it is not afraid. However, if the American forces penetrate deep into China and cause the Chongqing army to move, Japan is determined to strike and destroy them at any time.</p>
<p>Weekly Commentary: Coarse Grains and Shanghai Citizens' Food Supply by Shen Fu Cheng</p>
<p>Today’s food problem for the people is the biggest livelihood issue. If this food problem cannot be resolved in a reasonable manner, the people’s suffering cannot be alleviated even in the initial stage, and naturally, there will be no stability in their lives. To seek a reasonable solution to the food problem, thereby alleviating the people's suffering in the first step, is certainly an important task for the authorities. However, from the people's perspective, regarding the food that sustains their own lives, they should also try their best to solve it within the scope of their own power to reduce the severity of the entire food problem and alleviate the degree of the entire people's suffering. To put it more simply, for the resolution of the food problem, the government authorities should take full responsibility for overall planning, and the people themselves should also take individual responsibility for adapting to the environment. Only with such consistency from top to bottom and coordinated cooperation can a reasonable and practical solution be achieved. Otherwise, if the people only complain that the authorities do not seek a solution, the authorities will at most reach the stage of treating the symptom but not the disease. As a result, food will eventually become an unsolvable problem, and the people's suffering will naturally increase.</p>
<p>As for Shanghai's food problem, it is actually even more difficult to solve. Because Shanghai itself does not produce food, and the people of Shanghai are avid consumers who insist on eating white rice. Everyone has the concept and habit of only eating rice for meals. In recent years, the environment has changed, and now it has reached the point where it is absolutely impossible to satisfy the desire of Shanghai people to eat white rice. If the people of Shanghai themselves still insist on the habit of only eating rice, then they will only starve or go hungry. If the rich rely on their money to compete for hoarding rice, if the middle class rely on some stored rice to continue consuming as before, if the lower class also believe that arranging is not yet exhausted, and they can still insist on not eating anything but rice, then they will only drive up rice prices further and trap their lives in even deeper suffering.</p>
<p>Therefore, for us Shanghai citizens, in order to recognize the realistic situation of the food problem and reduce our own future suffering, we should abandon the concept and habit of only eating rice and should try our best to use coarse grains for food, or at least mix them with coarse grains. According to accurate estimates, the current grain is in a period between harvests, and the amount of rice stored in rice-producing areas is not sufficient. Even if it can be transported smoothly to Shanghai, the quantity will not be as large as desired, and the price will inevitably rise due to increased costs. However, the amount of coarse grains stored in coarse grain-producing areas is relatively abundant, enough to supply other places. Therefore, in terms of comparing the stock of rice and coarse grains, before the new grain harvest, the Shanghai citizens' food supply must be supplemented by coarse grains. This is the inevitable limitation of facts and the environment, and we cannot but adapt to the situation. I hope that the citizens will first understand this.</p>
<p>Moreover, there may be slight preferences in taste and psychology between eating rice and eating coarse grains, but in terms of maintaining survival, the efficiency is the same. On the contrary, in terms of nutritional value, coarse grains are better than white rice. According to the analysis and comparison of various essential nutrients, the richest is millet, followed by wheat, then corn, and the lowest is white rice. Therefore, eating coarse grains not only does not reduce the nutrients needed by the body but also has the possibility of increasing health. Northerners eat noodles and coarse grains all year round, and their bodies are stronger than those of southerners who eat rice. The author also comes from a coarse grain-producing area and has eaten naked barley and corn for food since childhood. He rarely suffers from illnesses. After coming to Shanghai and switching to white rice, he feels physically weak. I am confident that this is not an exaggeration. Therefore, in terms of nutrition and health, eating coarse grains is more beneficial.</p>
<p>In short, the solution to Shanghai's food problem in the future cannot but be supplemented by coarse grains, and citizens should automatically change their habits. At the same time, we feel that the proportional increase in the price of coarse grains along with the price of rice is completely an artificial increase in the supply quantity and has no reason at all. The authorities should pay attention to suppressing it. On the other hand, it is extremely necessary to purchase and transport large quantities of supplies from coarse grain-producing areas to Shanghai, allocate them at a fair price, supplement the people's food, and regulate the people's food. I hope that the authorities and influential people in the private sector will jointly plan and implement this as soon as possible, so that the Shanghai citizens' food problem can be gradually resolved.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Dispatch): National Government Vice President Zhou Fohai lost his father early in life and was raised and educated by his legal mother, Madam Ma Tai. Over the years, Mr. Zhou has been engaged in national affairs and has been unable to take care of her. Yesterday morning, the tragic news came that Madam Ma had passed away in Guiyang on the 25th of this month. Mr. Zhou was extremely saddened upon hearing the news and telegraphed Acting Chairman Chen to request resignation from all his concurrent positions in order to fulfill his filial piety. Acting Chairman Chen believed that the country was in a difficult situation and it was not the time for him to resign, so he sent a telegram to reassure him.

<p>"Acting Chairman Chen's Reply Telegram" To Shanghai Vice President Zhou Fohai Brother Li Jian, I returned to Nanjing from northern Jiangsu last night and only read it. It is impossible to overcome the grief. Your filial piety is extraordinary and you should be saddened, but the national affairs are so difficult that we rely on your participation in the great plan.

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Baoshan and Luodian</h3>
<p>— Ma Junliang</p>
<p>Baoshan is located near Shanghai. Before the war, it belonged to Jiangsu Province. It was only after the incident that it was assigned to Shanghai, initially as a special district, and then restored to county status. This old city was very prosperous before the war, but it happened to be in the war zone during the incident. Therefore, the county seat is desolate, with broken walls and ruins, a heart-wrenching sight. The street scene is far from what it used to be.</p>
<p>Baoshan's Agricultural Products</p>
<p>According to statistics, the total population of Baoshan County is over 100,000. Administratively, the county governs the towns of Yuepu, Yangxing, Luodian, Liuhang, Chuansha, Shengqiao, Gucun, Chenhang, Guangfu, etc. In terms of public security and urban appearance, Luodian is often considered the best. The total area of Baoshan County is 270,000 mu, of which farmland accounts for about half. Last year's agricultural harvest was more abundant than in neighboring counties. Here is a statistic of last year's output: The total rice production of the county was over 250,000 dan, cotton over 70,000 dan, wheat over 300,000 dan, and hemp about 700 shi. As for rural side occupations, half of the households make a living by raising livestock, and the other half by weaving homespun cloth, a significant amount of which is sold to other counties. Overall, Baoshan's rural economy is moving towards recovery.</p>
<p>Luodian, the Leading Town</p>
<p>Luodian is the leading town in Baoshan. In recent years, due to the unrest in rural areas, many people have moved to live in the town. Therefore, the town is prosperous, with a dense population, rows of shops, and numerous vendors. Small factories (spinning, flour) invested and established by people from Shanghai are springing up like mushrooms after rain. Today's Luodian is stepping into the prosperity it had during the war.</p>
<p>Luodian has four elementary schools and one junior high school. The Private Cotton Industry Elementary School is sponsored by the local cotton industry association. The school board members are all local wealthy gentlemen, and the principal has been serving in the education field for many years. The Private Fengle Elementary School is sponsored by the local rice and grain association, and the principal is Zang Shiru. The County Luodian Elementary School was originally located in Xincun, but has now been moved to a temple, and the person in charge is Yang Tengxiang. Jingxiu Elementary School, the former principal of the school was Cheng, is actually run by Ms. Ma Rongde, and the school's reputation is growing day by day. As for junior high schools, there is only Luoxi Middle School. Each school has five or six hundred students, with the most students in the Cotton Industry Elementary School. The teachers are all young people from the town, half male and half female, with uneven levels of education. Some have not even graduated from elementary school themselves, leading to many jokes.</p>
<p>In today's world of expensive rice and firewood, the life of teachers is particularly difficult. The salaries of each school are relatively high, calculated based on the current market price of rice (this is true for private schools, but not for county schools). For example, the director of the Cotton Industry Elementary School receives 2 dou and 2 sheng, and the class teachers and subject teachers receive 2 dou and 1 dou and 8 sheng, respectively. Fengle is similar to the Cotton Industry Elementary School, while Jingxiu is slightly inferior. The most pitiful is the County Luodian Elementary School. It is said that the teachers' salaries are only 330 yuan per month, which, at the current market price, can only buy one large pancake after a month of hard teaching.</p>
<p>Many local villagers are religious, and not a few have converted to Buddhism. What attracts the villagers the most is the Yiguandao. The so-called "Yiguan" means to melt the three religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism into one furnace. It is said that the sect sets up altars to preach on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month. Apart from these devout followers, others are strictly forbidden to visit. The doctrines are mysterious, claiming that believers do not get hit by stray bullets and are invulnerable to swords and spears. This is quite similar to the White Lotus Sect of the Qing Dynasty and the Xiantian Sect of Wuxi, inciting the hearts of the people to the extreme. As for the background of its emergence, the reasons are understandable, but if it is allowed to spread for a long time, the consequences will be disastrous. It is hoped that the relevant military and political authorities will guide it onto the right track to prevent further unrest.</p>
<p>Rampant Gambling</p>
<p>The establishment of tea houses in the area is like bamboo shoots after rain, because the villagers use tea houses as gambling venues. Mixed in them are local thugs and rascals, and people from all walks of life, shouting and gambling all night long. The stakes in a single game can amount to millions of dollars. Losers are not stingy, and this kind of all-or-nothing style is said to be commonplace. As a result, many people have ruined their families, lost their reputations, and committed suicide. Open gambling occurs, but the military and police organs turn a blind eye, raising various questions.</p>
<p>High Prices</p>
<p>The prices in Luodian are as high as in Shanghai. White rice has risen to 800,000 yuan, fresh meat is 4,000 yuan per jin, and vegetables are as high as 1,000 yuan per jin. The prices of daily necessities are even more astonishing. This may be facilitated by illegal taxes.</p>

<h3>Advisory Council Decides to Organize a Committee for Regulating Food Supply, Planning to Raise 10 Billion Yuan to Procure Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Council, in view of the fact that the people's food supply in the city during this lean period must rely on coarse grains to supplement it, and according to recent surveys, the reserves of coarse grains in the producing areas are relatively abundant, and after contacting the relevant agencies, if it is possible to find ways to procure them, it can be used to supplement the city's food supply. However, dealing with large quantities of coarse grains involves issues such as funds, transportation, and security, which cannot be handled by a small number of grain merchants. Only by forming another group can we concentrate our efforts to procure the grains. Therefore, on June 27, the Standing Committee of the Municipal Advisory Council and the Essential Commodities Subcommittee held a joint meeting to discuss this issue. It was decided to organize a Shanghai Special Municipality Committee for Regulating Food Supply to be responsible for implementation, and Li Sihao, Hu Zewu, Liu Xingchen, Zhu Boquan, Xiang Kangyuan, Jin Xiongzi, Sun Dong, Xi Ai Lu, Chen Binxian and other nine people were appointed as members. It is also planned to raise 10 billion yuan, with 500,000 yuan as a unit, with half of the funds subscribed by private entities, and the remaining half expected to be raised by the municipal government for general distribution.</p>
<h3>Government Employees in Various Counties of the City Decide to Distribute Rice as Salary, Using Funds for Relief in the Same Way as the Urban Areas</h3>
<p>The salaries of government employees, police officers, and teachers in various county-run schools under the city are low, and their lives are difficult. In order to ensure that they can serve with peace of mind, the relevant departments were previously ordered to convene relevant departments, the Finance Bureau, and county administration management agencies to discuss the issue of distributing rice as salary free of charge, in order to treat them the same as the urban areas and use funds for relief. After deliberation, a distribution plan was formulated, jointly signed and approved, and then issued to the county administrative meeting on June 15 for discussion. The meeting first designated attendees to review the plan, proposed review opinions, and submitted them to the meeting for resolution. The revised plan was passed according to the review opinions, and the County Administration Office submitted the resolution and other documents to the municipal government for approval. The order has now been approved and the County Administration Office has recorded the case and notified the counties to follow the plan. The contents of the plan are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Government employees, police officers, and teachers in various county governments and affiliated agencies and county-run schools should, like government employees in various bureaus and offices under the municipal government, be given three dou of rice per person per month free of charge, starting from February of this year.</p>

<p>(A) Those directly appointed by the municipal government.</p>

<p>(C) Those directly appointed by the Municipal Finance Bureau or other bureaus and offices of the municipal government, whose positions, personnel, and salaries are all included in the establishment and reported to the Finance Bureau or other bureaus and offices for transmission to the municipal government.</p>
<p>Each county government or financial agency under the counties of this city shall prepare a roster separately in accordance with the points referred to in the second item (the positions and salaries must be included), in six copies. The county government shall send the roster to the County Administration Office, and the financial agency shall send it to the Finance Bureau for separate verification and submission to the municipal government for approval of the standard for rice distribution. The aforementioned roster shall be delivered by July 15.</p>
<p>Part-time personnel who have already received rice from one agency shall not receive it from another agency.</p>
<p>Those who hold honorary positions in the county government or its affiliated agencies, such as village and township chiefs, and autonomous personnel, as well as micro-collection personnel of the county's financial agencies, such as those who are local village and township chiefs or temporarily employed, and are paid public funds under the commission item, shall not be eligible for rice distribution.</p>
<p>The retroactive distribution of rice before June and the distribution of rice shall be limited to employees who are in office. Those who have left their positions will no longer be compensated.</p>
<p>After the implementation of this principle, all allocations of rice in various counties shall be stopped.</p>
<p>Various counties are preparing to start collecting in-kind taxes. In accordance with Article 20 of the Provisional Regulations on the Collection of In-Kind Taxes on Land, all rice collected as tax shall be stored in warehouses and await orders from the municipal government for disposal. Before receiving orders, it shall not be used without authorization. Rice that should be received by various county governments should be temporarily borrowed from local fundraising items, and an estimate should be prepared and submitted for verification. It can only be requested for write-off after the municipal government approves it and issues an order.</p>

<p>Discussion Items</p>
<p>Since the commencement of the city's population dispersal efforts, many household heads have returned to their hometowns, or there are inheritance relationships involving rent, often because the household head [is absent from] Shanghai, which greatly affects household registration work. Resolution: If the household head [leaves] the residence, the change must be reported immediately, or if it is a temporary trip, the household head should appoint a dependent household member within the household to act as the household head, or if it is a house rental, the new [tenant] should act as the holder of rights, or another dependent household member within the dependent household should act as the household head. If residents travel back and forth, they must report within three days. The change of the household head is unrelated to rental rights.</p>

<p>Are You a "Lucky One"?</p>
<p>By Gao Ying</p>
<p>—Impressions of the Joint Graduation Ceremony of Municipal Schools—</p>
<p>"...You are truly the lucky ones. In times as tense as these, and with life as difficult as it is, that you students are still able to study in peace and attend this graduation ceremony can be said to be a great favor from your families and society. How should you invigorate yourselves and how should you repay this!"</p>
<p>These were the words spoken by Secretary-General Luo of the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday morning at the joint graduation ceremony of municipal primary and secondary schools held at the Great Light Cinema, representing the Mayor, in his address to the more than two thousand primary and secondary school graduates.</p>
<p>Indeed, in these times of widespread war and suffering, when people are struggling to survive even with the most basic and rudimentary ways of life, this group of young men and women attending this graduation ceremony are undoubtedly the lucky ones of the era.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the last day of June, the scorching sun raged and the heat was intense. Long before the start of the meeting - 9:30 a.m. - teams of primary and secondary school students arrived on foot, none of them without sweat streaming down their backs due to the heat, appearing very tired.</p>
<p>These primary school students, panting and sweating, stepped into the theater, their faces showing joy and ease. Thinking about the thirst for education and the situation of the so-called "lucky ones," it seems that one can understand their situation from the faces of people on the streets and corners who are holding gun-shaped biscuits and gnawing on them.</p>
<p>I remember last summer, when the second joint graduation ceremony of municipal primary and secondary schools was held at the same location, Acting Chairman Chen (then in the capacity of Mayor) personally presented awards and delivered a speech. In his speech, there was such a passage: "...Our organization is not strict and strong enough, and our ordinary national life is not profound enough, so society has become so chaotic and discipline has deteriorated so much. These are the current phenomena, and we must not let the second generation continue like this. This responsibility lies on the shoulders of all teachers and all our little brothers and sisters..."</p>
<p>These little brothers and sisters are our second generation, our successors. Isn't what Acting Chairman Chen hoped for last year exactly what we all hope for? The graduation ceremony of primary and secondary schools deserves our attention. When previous ceremonies were held, the highest civil official of the city attended in person, and the reason is very obvious.</p>
<p>At half-past nine, the entire Great Light Cinema was packed with a sea of heads, and almost all two thousand seats in the theater were "full." The national flags were displayed in pairs, with a portrait of the Premier hanging high in the middle. In front of the hall, there were ten or so chairs, divided into a seat for officials and a seat for VIPs. On the large table in the center, there were two bottles of fresh flowers on either side, with bright colors. The center was piled with four bundles of graduation certificates, and in front of the table, there was a row of twenty or so pots of flowers and plants, reflecting the light, the green shadows dripping, giving a feeling of coolness.</p>
<p>In the left corner, the lid of a "Piana" piano had already been opened. The meeting order was posted on the wall. In addition to the first five or six items, such as the opening [ unclear], reading, instructions, and speeches, the main part of the second half was the farewell speeches given by male and female student representatives, and the Mayor's awarding of graduation certificates to representatives of the four schools.</p>
<p>In the center of the "main hall" below the stage, the first five rows were the principals' seats. The principals of each school sat there elegantly, either fanning themselves or waving their hats, trying to get some breeze from the warm currents of the crowd. To the right of the principals' seats was the press seat, and to the left was the police band. The musicians in yellow uniforms filled several rows of seats. However, there was plenty of room in the press seat, with many empty seats. Assuming this is the location of profession, then it must be because the life of a journalist is too poor!</p>
<p>At forty past nine, at the sound of rising, Secretary-General Luo had already [surrounded] the stage. From order of one, two, three items…in sequence down, Secretary-General Luo made a speech on behalf of the Mayor. To sum it up, there were two points in his speech: Shanghai's environment is too bad, and young people often go astray, so they should exert their own strength and work hard to transform and build it. Striving to modernize China and become perfect citizens to fight together for the future of the world. In addition, he expressed his gratitude to the school principals and teachers present, and apologized to the students and their parents, fearing that there were many places that were simple and crude. With earnest words and valuable advice. (To be continued)</p>
<p>The First Obligatory Middle School of Social Service</p>

<p>Hoping That Schools Will Donate Textbooks</p>
<p>The First Obligatory Middle School, sponsored by this newspaper's Charity Society, has received a large number of applicants in recent days. The entrance examination is scheduled to be held today (the 1st) from 8 a.m., and the class schedule will be determined. However, the textbooks to be used are still not settled. Currently, book prices are soaring, and poor students are really unable to afford them. In view of this, our Society sincerely seeks a large number of middle school textbooks, from the first year of junior high school to the first year of senior high school. All textbooks for Chinese, mathematics, English, physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, botany and zoology, hygiene, etc., are welcome. We hope that all sectors will provide continuous donations. The collection addresses are as follows:</p>
<p>309 Hankou Road, Social Service Department of this newspaper</p>

<p>The Chinese Epidemic Hospital, founded by Mr. Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Lvdeng, Xu Qianlin, and others, has been located at the intersection of Ward Road in Tilanqiao, an area with many factories in East Shanghai, for many years. As usual, from July 1st, it will begin to receive patients with epidemic diseases and provide consultations day and night. All outpatient services, registration fees, acupuncture, and medicines are completely free. However, the hospital has no funds. At a time when prices are rising sharply and expenses are huge, it hopes that people from all walks of life will provide substantial assistance and donations, which can be sent directly to the Chinese Pharmacy Office of the hospital on Xinzha Road, and receipts will be issued.</p>
