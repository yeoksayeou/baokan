<h3 id="c1">赫爾利斥職業外交家　破壞故羅總統指令　蘇聯願與中國相和睦 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓六日電〕上星期辭職之駐華大使赫爾利將軍，今日告參院外交委員會云：蘇聯與美國對華態度相同。渠稱：「蘇聯並不支持中國之共產黨，不願中國發生內戰，亦不願分裂中國，而願與中國和睦相處。」渠之所以作此結論，乃根據「我與史達林及莫洛托夫之會談。」渠並盛譽蔣主席及國民政府曰：「中國如一困鬥之受傷猛虎，單獨與日本作戰，歷時甚久。</p>
<h3 id="c2">蔣主席英武不屈　為民族權利奮鬥 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>中國本可與日本妥協，實則妥協條件異常有利，而其時吾人猶未參戰，然蔣主席英武不屈，爲民族之權利奮鬥。赫爾利結束其二日來在外交委員會所作之演說稱：渠之所以辭職，乃因職業外交家破壞渠執行故羅斯福總統指令時所作之努力。渠稱：羅斯福總統曾指令渠支持中國國民政府，使蔣主席部下能繼續與日軍周旋於戰塲中。委員會主席台克薩斯州民主黨參議員康納利乃問：「君成功吾？」赫爾利稱：渠略有成就，但渠爲「團結中國各勢力」所作之努力，則爲職業外交家所阻。前此赫爾利曾稱謝偉思及艾其森乃國務院中與渠敵對之領導人物，今日渠復另加一人名。康納利屢欲使赫爾利公佈此一人名，最後赫爾利乃稱：「艾德遜」。按艾德遜現爲副國務卿，前此曾任助理國務卿。康納利問：「渠作何事？」赫爾利反唇譏曰：「渠作何事？我本不欲言，然君旣問——」赫爾利乃細述伊朗宣言之經過及美國其他政策。（據稱：赫爾利曾謂艾德遜與其他人員顚覆美國在伊朗之外交政策。）此後赫爾利復構：渠之「政治顧問弗利門及林華爾」未協助渠執行羅斯福總統之指令。渠並指責艾其森及謝偉思曾告中國共產黨，謂赫爾利並未眞實代表美國。</p>
<h3 id="c3">魏德邁忠實盡職　告誡僚屬應遵行政府政策 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>康納利問：「渠等以何法告共產黨？」赫爾利答稱：「渠等藉信件，談話，及與共黨相聚之便，將此言告之共產黨。」赫爾利復稱：美國「海外之多頭行政機關，及軍事代表，未執行吾國之外交政策。」</p>
<p>參院議員白里奇斯乃問：「魏德邁二級上將是否盡其職責？」赫爾利稱：「魏將軍之原幹與忠實，不可訾議。」渠稱渠曾召集所屬，告誡彼等云：總統指令乃謂戰時人人皆應遵行政府之政策，不論贊同與否。赫爾利復言；「余意渠等或不贊同美國政策，然吾人旣處身戰爭之中，吾等之政策，復爲吾人之合法政府所規定者，吾人惟有執行此一政策，不可另作主張。」</p>
<p>韋勒發問云：「君於彼時公平折衝於雙方之間，而彼等則否乎？」赫氏答曰：然！「然則彼等與共黨狼狽爲奸乎？」赫氏答曰：「余不能言其不忠於吾人，但信渠等以打倒蔣委員長爲最有利於中國之事，余曾告渠等曰：總統之命令，乃擁護蔣委員長也。」韋勒又問曰：「一國大使之僚屬旣有如此之舉動，是否應有補救辦法？」赫氏答稱：誠然余已將渠等免職，渠等返華盛頓後，即任余之監察人，而破壞余之政策。」韋勒問：「何人應負將渠等升級之責任？」赫氏答：「余距離本國一萬三千哩，余不能事事明瞭，但國務卿在慣例上乃屬國務院之主管長官也。」其後經康納利反覆詢問，赫氏乃承認曰：「余以爲近東工作人員，實誠心擁護國務院之政策，管理該院之享特遜一，曾擁護杜總統之政策，余信副國務卿艾德遜雖爲反對該項政策之主要人物，但余不知院中究有多少人支援之。」赫氏旋即發表一冗長而富情感之宣言，論及人之權利，民主之利益，統治者之義務，大西洋憲章之優點，及伊朗國之宣言諸要點，渠誠懇呼籲外交活動之聯繫，要求實行錄用外交人員較佳之辦法，而盛讚聯合國組織。康納利氏繼向赫氏稱謝，而宜佈云：國務卿貝爾納斯將於七日以見證人地位出席發言。</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶七日電〕蔣主席對昆明罷課風潮，甚爲關懷，七日午特派敎育部次長朱經農飛昆處理，並發表告昆明敎育界書，電達昆市各校當局及敎職員，表示對此事當作公平處置，希勸導學生即日復課，全文如下：昆市發生學潮，學生課業中較，已逾旬日，妨害靑年學業，貽誤建國前途，興念及此，痛心無已。我國抗戰八年，犧牲慘重，今勝利甫告實現，復興時機不可復得，正宜同德同心，積極鼓勉進行建國之工作，乃訛言流傳波及學府，演成如此不幸之事件，此眞所謂爲仇者所快，而親者所痛也。學校爲社會之中堅，學生爲建國之基幹，學校學生之一言一動，應爲社會之模範，亦繫國家之命脈，必當明辯是非，認淸職責，重視課業，遵守紀綱，萬不可辜負國家作育之苦心，違反時代付與之使命。中正愛護靑年，不啻自身之子弟，更不啻我純潔之靑年，學生有自誤誤國之舉動。今日抗戰雖告勝利，然國事艱難，民生痛苦，吾人天職所在，必求維持一切秩序之安定，使復員建國不受妨礙，抗戰成果得以保持，吾則將無以對抗戰殉難先烈之英靈，並遠背我學校師生艱苦轉徙擁護抗戰之初衷。中正維護敎育，保持紀綱，皆屬職無旁貸，對於此　事件，必當根據是非與法紀，作公平負責之處置，決不有所偏袒，亦不有所姑息，惟我各校敎職員對於學校，對於國家亦均負有神聖之責任，應導學生於正軌，爲社會作表率，切不可任令罷課風潮再有遷延，造成學校與社會無政府，無秩序之狀態，以貽國家之羞，目前一切問題，必以恢復課業爲前題，以正常手續爲解決，否則政府縱如何愛護青年，亦不能放棄其維護敎育，安定秩序之職責，切望我各校當局與敎職員諸君深體此意，對全體學生剴切勸導，務令即日上課，恢復常態，勿負余諄切之期望，至深企盼，蔣中正手啓，三十四年十二月七日。</p>

<h3 id="c6">收復區接收處理情況　翁文灝在參政駐會委會報告 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶七日電〕翁文灝七日在參政會駐會委會報告收復各區接收處理要况，全文如下：關於停戰後敵僞產業處理辦法，中央歷經規定法規，並劃定各機關工作分配標準。自八月間日正式投降後，政府更規定各項正式辦法，政府先在各區設立各部特派員辦公處，爲各大部份之專管組織，又在各省市設立黨政接收委員會，爲共同協議機構，嗣因各方面辦理情形有需更爲整理與加强，復加設全國性事業接收委員會，以期集中推進，該委員會會址規定設於陸軍總司令部之所在地，以期互相聯繫，對日方取一致之態度。又在重要各區設敵僞產業處理局，並設審議委員會，以集中規定具體處理辦法，妥為執行，各處理機構中現已實行成立，積極辦理者爲上海區及河北。平。津區，尙籌設者如山東·靑島區·湘鄂·武漢區及廣東區等，凡此各區處理工作，均由行政院積極督促，認眞進行。政院曾正式規定收復區敵僞產業處理辦法，分令各部會及各省市照辦，此項辦法之內容，一方面規定各機關接收保管與運用之具體標準，例如軍用品歸軍政部，軍艦歸海軍總司令部，陸上運輸工具歸戰時運輸管理局，水上運輸工具歸招商局，工廠·礦塲設備·原料。成品歸經濟部，地產·房屋·傢具歸中央信託局等。另一方面規定敵僞資產之處理原則，凡產業原屬本國或友邦人民，確由日方强迫接收者，應查明證據，發還原主，凡原屬華人與日偽合辦者之主主權，均收歸中央政府，凡原為日人所有或已歸日偽出資收購者，其產權均收歸中央政府，分別性質，撥交資源委員會，紡織業管理委員會或糧食部，其不在此應行撥交範圍以內者，以公平價格標售，移歸民營。各區處行局及審議委員會即依此辦法，查明各事件之具體情形擬具處理方法，呈請行政院核定施行。接收後處理工作，目前正在進行中，因接收查詢而得知日本在戰時對於吾國經濟之經營及管制辦法，具見彼方策劃運用之實在途徑，大致言之，可分兩大時期，一爲興亞院時期，當時將華北劃歸日木陸軍主管，以陸軍軍官任居中指揮之責，以華中華南劃歸日本海軍範圍，以海軍軍官處居中領導之地。二爲大東亞省時期，海軍不復負責，華北仍歸陸軍，華中及華南則以外交官任公使負責指導，至共實行機講，則以華中振興公司（原名中支那振興株式會社）及華北開發公司（原名北支那開發株式會社）爲兩大中堅，些二公司皆爲依照日本法律而成立之日本法人，受大柬亞省之指揮監督，總裁及副總裁皆由日本政府派任，理　　事亦受大東亞省之示意與核定。華中振興公司炎本日金一億元，准發債券日金五億元，自成立以至日本投降時止，該公司在華中投資日金一億五千萬元，積炎四億四千餘萬元，又曾訂製戰時必需用品貸款僞中儲券四百五十億元。華中振興公司投資組織之公司，為華中礦業公司炎本僞中儲券四十五億元，華中水電公司資本七十八億餘元，華中蠶絲公司炎本十億元，華中水產公司資本十三億八千萬元，華中國業公司資本二十億元，華中鐵道公司資本四百七十五億元，華中電氣通訊公司資本六十億元，中華一輪船公司資本三十億元，上海內河輪船公司資本二十七億元，上海恒產公司炎本三十七億五千萬元，大上海瓦斯公司炎本九億元，華中都市公共汽車公司資本十二億元，淮南煤煉公司資本四十一億五千萬元。（未完）</p>

<p>今天是全世界人類不應忘記的一天，尤其是上海市民更不當遺忘的一天。四年前的今天，日寇偷襲珍珠港，發動太平洋戰爭。在日寇固然瘋狂地自掘墳墓，而全世界人類因之飽變戰禍者不可勝數。四年前的今天，日寇侵入了本市的租界，不但與英美僑民爲敵，並且完全剝奪了全上海市民一切自由，視爲奴隸牛馬之不若。再就我們輿論界來說，四年前的今天以後，直到今年日寇投降爲止，其間上海就沒有自由自主的言論。所以上海的報人，對於今天的回憶更見深切而沉痛</p>
<p>日酋東條發動太平洋戰爭，自詡爲「大東亞聖戰」，由偷，珍珠港起，攻菲律濱，佔新加坡，侵略馬來，攻佔荷印，南叩漢洲門牆，西窺印度窗戶，東路關島以控制夏咸夷，北跨千島羣島以進逼阿拉斯加，叱咤雲，不可一世。但曾未一年，而一敗於珊瑚海，再敗於所羅門羣島，由是兇燄頓挫，戰局改觀。吾偉大盟邦的美國，在其羅斯福杜魯門兩位大總統先後領導之下，得馬歇爾元帥之運籌帷幄，史汀生，諾克斯諸氏之整軍經武，艾森豪威爾，麥克阿瑟諸上將之決勝千里，更與中英蘇聯，左提右挈，駢肩作戰，不及四年，制勝兩洋，使東西惡魔同歸於盡，德意日三個軸心强盜先後無條件投降。由今天回想，太平洋戰爭不但是日寇自掘墳墓的「傑作」，而且是整個反民主的侵略國家崩潰的前奏。在勝利以後，我們第一次逢到這個驚心怵目的日子，首先應該對成千成萬盟邦壯烈犧牲的將士致其無限的崇敬與悼念。而中美英蘇四大盟國領袖，堅苦卓絕的領導，密切無間的合作，使民主國家的聯合作戰終於獲得空前的勝利，在歷史上實已寫下永不磨滅的一頁。</p>
<p>發動太平洋戰爭的，表而是東條，而實際則爲近衛。近衛文應於一九三七年六月一日繼林銑而首次組閣，方過一月，就發動七七事變，對中國作全面侵略。他的抱負，就是秉承田中義一的策略，由征服滿蒙而征服中國，由征服中國而征服世界。「八紘一宇」的野心，實在是他發動　華戰爭的主因。後來雖一度辭職，但一九四〇年七月十七日他繼米內之後，重為馮婦，時越一年，政府夭折，却又三度糾閣。這不能僅僅看做近衛意存　棧，實在由於他始終妄圖貫澈查所謂「東亞共榮圈」的國策，想從「確立高度的戰時體制」爲進一步擴大侵略的入手方法。他第二次與第三次的組閣，均以東條英機爲陸相，可見東條就是近衛內閣的骨幹，也是近衛組閣的靈魂。第三近衛內閣在位不及三月，即遊嬗於東條，東條糾閣不及兩月，而太平洋戰爭的大火爆發，即如燎原之不可遏。更可見東條約狂妄行動，近衛實爲其先鋒。　之放火，近衛積其新，東條煽其燄譬之決流，近衛開其閘，柬條毀其堤。近衛於三次組閣之始，即自白其使命，說什麼「皇國之不動國策早經確立，今日惟有急速趨於果斷之一途」。不動之國策是什麼？就是由征服中國而征服世界。急速果斷是什麼？就是要不顧一切的蠻幹。這衣鉢，東條確是全心全力替他繼承的了。故侵華戰爭的罪魁固是近衛，而發動太平洋戰爭偷襲珍珠港的罪魁，東條而外，也還是近衛。可是在日寇投降以後，柬條雖早被捕，而近衛還想假裝「民主」，儼然自命爲溫和穩健一流，像煞有介事的爲日皇裕仁担任修改日本憲法工作，實在恬不知恥。在紀念太平洋戰爭四週年的前夕，我們聽到麥克阿瑟元帥下令逮捕近衛與木戶，課以戰罪，確是一件令人痛快的消息。</p>
<p>我們自己並不懷有絲毫狹隘的復仇觀念，我們也不希望世界上人類之間有所謂不解的「世仇」，但是一次殺人千萬的殘酷戰爭，終了之後究不能不淸算一番戰爭的責任。太平洋戰爭，全世界反侵略的戰爭，我們民主國家是光榮的勝利了。我們對敵國無辜的人民，儘管可以寬大，儘管可以用敎育的方法使其重爲和平善良的民族，但對於發動戰爭的敵國的軍閥官僚政客，以及媚敵叛國的漢奸國賊，不能不有嚴正的懲處。吾則無以對犧牲的將士，更無以對飽受荼毒的人民。</p>
<p>最後，我們要使世界上將來不復再有殘酷無比的戰爭，更需要中美英蘇四大盟邦以及一切聯合國家，在平時須如在載時一樣精誠無簡的合作。庶幾太平洋永遠太平，戰爭永遠離開我們！</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓六日電〕美政府正促世界各國於明年上半年召開一國際貿易會議，藉以促進貿易及就業。國務院本日宣佈國務卿貝爾納斯業已將舉行此種會議之建議，送達各國政府。此一文件之序文，係出諸貝爾納斯之手筆，原文如后：</p>
<p>此一小册內之建議，係美國專家於助理國務卿克萊頓指揮下合作擬就者，藉供美人民及其他國家政府與人民之參考，以爲召開國際貿易及就業會議之準備。根據本册所提建議之會議，實有及早舉行之必要。各國現方考慮戰後應採行之貿易政策，此等政策亟應獲致彼此之協議，以防世界劃分爲若干經濟集團。是以美政府深信此項由聯合國出頭召集之會議，至遲須於一九四六年夏閒舉行，服職職合國機關之美方代表將力促其實現。</p>

<h3 id="c38">英國遠東唯一學府　香港大學透視 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 樂達觀</p>
<p>英國有三個直轄殖民地大學：一個是一七六九年設立的馬爾太大學（Malta　University），一個是一九二五年設立的直布羅陀大學（Gibraltar　Univsesity），還有一個，就是香港大學（Hongkong　Unversity）。</p>
<p>香港大學，在一九〇七年，由香港總警斐萊台里芝庫辣額獨爵士發起創辦，於一九一一年正式成立。它的創辦目的，據說，是適應世界新思潮，給予香港的中國靑年以新學識。</p>
<p>最初香港政廳捐港幣一百七十萬元（約的合二十萬鎊），後美國留港富豪保羅契脫（Sir　Paul　Chater），捐金二萬六千鎊，美國煤油大王洛克斐爾財團捐金八萬鎊，和的翰司惠衣公司（Messers　John　Swire　&amp;　Sans）捐金四萬鎊，全都指定爲香港大學基金，存入銀行生息。便把這基金的年息港幣三六九·二六〇元，連同英關政府每年補助港幣三五〇·〇〇〇元，作爲該大學常年經費。</p>
<p>戰前的香港大學，設有文，工，商三學院。文工兩院四年修畢，選科限六年修畢，行男女同學制。每生每年學費港幣四百元，宿費港幣三百元。在當時已覺取費過昂，近貴族化，非富家或中產階級十弟所能負担。全校男女學生的四百人，多係港籍或廣東籍，從馬來半島和其他南洋華僑方面的子弟送來就讀的也頗多。</p>
<p>至於校舍方面，除課室以及各項事務案外，有男宿舍六，女宿舍一，並有規模宏大的圖書館，藏書八萬卷，幾乎半數是中國書籍。</p>
<p>香港，氣候溫和，四季如春。因為地當南洋航路之衝，而且又是世界有數的海軍良港，使該大學把握了英國遠東海軍很據地的權威，而提高了國際的地位。一九四一年十二月八日太平洋戰爭發生，香港即慘遭渝陷，聞該大學也受到相當損失。</p>
<p>現在戰爭結束了，國府將用外交方式解決香港問題，正不知這英國遠東的唯一學府——香港大學，將來的地位怎樣？</p>

<p>〔本埠特訊〕在舉國要求快辦漢奸聲中，懲治漢奸條例適告重訂公布。記者因往訪滬高二分院首席檢察官向哲溶氏，微詢對此條例之意見。</p>
<p>向氏當即指稱：該條例經重訂之後，有一顯著之變異，即原有條例規定，懲治漢奸之罪刑，祇死刑及無期徒刑二種：今則情節較輕者，得減處五年以上之有期徒刑，按處理漢奸案件，除木條例外，亦得通用危害民國緊急治罪法，刑法或其他法律，但如各法律之規定容有衝突之時，向氏聲稱：應秉「後法優於前法」之原則，採用最新頒佈之法律。至於通敵或附逆之外僑，究應如何處置一點，向氏謂：抗戰以前，蘇聯及德國均已放棄領事裁判權，其後英美等國於簽訂新約時，亦已表示放棄此種特權，故該國等之僑民，如有犯罪行爲，自亦應由我國法院處理。目前由逮捕機關移解高院檢察處之漢奸案件，爲數僅四十餘起，已經處分者，約七八起，除一部份因罪嫌不足，不予起訴外，已提出公訴者，約四五起。記者又因前傳漢奸案件之被告，於審判中不得享受律師辯護之權利，特以詢問向氏，向氏答稱並無此項規定，並謂被告如不服判決時，亦得向最高法院提出上訴。</p>

<p>昨日下午七時四十五分至八時，上海地方協會會長杜月笙氏，應中央廣播事業管理處之邀，在上海廣播電台演講，題爲擁護蔣主席經濟建設政策。</p>
<p>杜氏首謂別父老八年，時深系念，旅渝期開，在抗戰建國前提下，從事經濟金融事業，一度考察西北，深覺亟須開發。本年六月初奉　委員長面論，前往東南担任工作，乃於六月二十五日離渝，於七月十六日到達浙江淳安，八月十一日日人請降，本人於九月三日返抵上海。</p>
<p>主席訓示尤廳擁護</p>
<p>最近　蔣主席發表建國時期之經濟政策，並成立最高經濟委員會，蔣主席訓示中所啓示的目標，就是實行民生主義，盡全力恢復國內秩序與安全。我們從蔣主席訓詞中尋繹出來，政府對工商將改善運輪，造就人才，糾正不良現敎。對於農業，將减低地租及高利貸，以改善農民生活，他如穩定幣制，鼓勵對外貿易等等，均爲實現政策的具體辦法。宋院長所啓示的原則，着重於政府負貨扶助人民發展經濟一點，我們應在蔣主席宋院長啓示之下，就政府經濟政策範圍以內盡其全力，以求自力更生。上海在工商方面，向居全國領導地位，尤應一致擁護。</p>
<p>趕緊生產不容停頓</p>
<p>再次兄弟還有一點小意見，我們經過敵人八年來摧殘與破壞，損失之車，無可計算，元氣恢復，決非一二十年所能做到，所以我們在勝利之後，必須趕緊生產，不容有短時期的停頓。據聞單是華北一處，停工一天，損失六億元，這是一個何等龐大的數字，我們今犬何能忍受這等重大的損失。</p>
<p>上海物價一致趨跌</p>
<p>此外關於本市物價，兄弟在這裏附帶報告一點：蔣主席在最高經濟委員會訓詞中所說「盡全力來恢復國內的秩序和安全「一語，物價問題目亦包括在內，就建設兩字的涵義而言積極是建設，消極是安定，上海物價自經宋院長蒞滬指　，市長及有關當局設法平抑，封存物資，經劉局長迅速處理，逐漸出蘢，上海工商各業，亦能仰體主席德意，自相勸戒，以故最近物價多已一致趨跌，可見政府領導於上，人民協從於下，自收事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>一體恪遵公正廉潔</p>
<p>總之，戰後艱難，比之戰時尤甚，我們此時，不令痛定思痛，尤須以大無長之精神，接受建國期中所必經的痛苦。蔣主席在最高經濟委員會訓詞中又曾說過，「在這個時期所需要的，就是一切公私生活，都必須絕對公正廉潔。這是我們歷史上一個重要的關頭，絕對不能容忍綏慢貪污，或自私自利的人來榨取人民，以岡謀個人的富貴」。道些話固然是訓勉在位的，但我們國民亦應引爲借鏡，一體恪遵，願與諸位共勉。</p>

<h3 id="c61">四年前的今天　一篇血淚帳的回憶 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>四年前今天大清早出版的本報，曾有過這樣一小段最後消息的報導，說是是：「今晨四時三十分許，突有砲聲起自浦江東首，約一刻鐘，天空並起黑煙，雜有機槍聲，居民多從夢中驚醒……」</p>
<p>八日的晨曦，天色還是黑沉沉的，恬靜的黃浦江上驀地揚起了熾烈的砲火。英艦「伯脫羅爾」號做了上海日本駐軍「奇壞」下的犧牲者，泊在鄰近的美砲艦「成克」號，　　大勢已去，和平地揚起了白旗，這是上海日本駐軍當天開入租界的序幕。</p>
<p>十時左右，虹口的日本駐軍一批一批地通過四川路橋，浩浩蕩　開開向蘇州河南堍。全市重要的公用事業，軍政機關，……以及一切被認爲有佔領必要的機關，在一兩小時之問，都被他們佔據封閉了。繼之，皇皇的日本陸海軍大佈告，貼滿了全市。</p>
<p>起初，有些人還懷疑浦江槍砲聲是一種演習，後來，體明了這是錯誤的。佔領租界的所謂一皇軍，」已是觸目皆是了。</p>
<p>這一天夜的上海，一反過去的繁榮豪華，一切都變爲沉寂陰森，呌人不寒而慄。</p>
<p>第三天（十日）的淸早。九點鐘左右，各銀行紛紛開門，可是曇花一現，一小時後又關上了大門。此後營業時間縮短到每天三小時，每戶限制提存五百元。市塲暫告停頓，上海的經濟小融圈，已盡入於魔掌的控制中。</p>
<p>連帶着，米糧也發生大恐慌。「何處有米出售？」差不多大家要這樣的探詢着。爲了糴二升米，幾乎把整個的性命去掙扎。</p>
<p>緊接着糧食短細而來的是燃料奇缺，於是煤及煤球自十日起限制移運，全市的汽油又都先後查封。公共汽車自十二日起，行駛時間縮短，電車亦隨以减少行駛班次，祥生·雲飛·泰來·銀色·四大出租汽車行，十三日起全部停駛，一切的私人汽車，不久亦經禁止行駛。這一切，無非是敵人爲搜括一些僅存的燃料，而置整個都市交通於麻痺之中。</p>
<p>這寫不盡的一片血淚帳，可說是不忍卒述的。本報當時以「鼓吹抗日」的關係，早就受到日軍的注意，日軍進佔租界後，接管本報乃意料中事。想不到日軍竟以臨大敵的姿態，携了全副衝鋒配備開到本館，本館毫不猶疑，以當日（八日）出版的第「二四三三七」號一版報紙，宣告光榮的停刋。可是停刋時，我們與一般上海市民同具堅決的信念，認爲祖國抗戰的勝利，更近一步，上海的復原快先着鞭，我們光榮的復刋是指日可待的。現在果爾抗戰已勝，本報亦於上月廿二日以第「二四三三八」號報紙光榮復刊。然而建國前途，復興上海，尙待加倍的努力！（蒼龍）</p>

<p>兩天來的陰雨，給這山城套上了冬的外衣。帶着雪意的寒風，讓貧苦層中掙扎着的人們又加重了不少的苦痛和呻吟！</p>
<p>赫爾利的辭職，馬歇爾的將臨，新舊市長的交替，和公民選舉等等都是人們口中熱烈的談論炎料。</p>
<p>國共的消息，使得無涯的悲憤焦急的情緒，咬嚙着無數的善良百姓的心！在街頭，在巷尾，在這山城每一個角落裏，都充溢着那些善良的老百姓們的沉痛的聲音。</p>
<p>每一條東下的輪船開行時的笛聲，會引起無數的嘆息。那些遠望着故鄕而不能購得一紙船票的眼光，交織成多少幅焦急失望的圖景，在江水上，在遠雲中。</p>
<p>轟動山城的黃金案正在偵查法辦的時候，中國銀行門口又發現了夜以待旦的買金者的行列。黃金案的犯人墮入法網了。而這些出一萬元一夜僱人站排買大量黃金的人們，却在幾百萬幾百萬的增加着他們的資產！</p>
<p>失業的人數日漸增多，南岸曾有過聚衆白食的失業者。物價還是在那高昂的指數上膠滯着。安分守己的公務人員們並沒有展開過笑臉。</p>

<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>愈做人愈覺得人難做或做人難，特別是在現在中國的社會裏面。假使你做人太方正，那未你會事事行不通，人家見了你就討厭。假使你太圓滑，人家又說你沒有誠意，事事不信任你。不過大體講起來，在中國的現社會中，圓到比方正來得容易成功。『圓到』的意思是祇要你能圓滑，你便處處可到，不易遇到阻碍。好比一隻圓皮球，即使中途有阻碍，它仍可以從旁邊滾滑過去。『方正』的意思就是候使做事太方，隨時就得呌你立正。一個正方形的木塊，當我們把它向地上一擲的時候，它頂多滾一二下就停止不動了。這個社會似乎是不信任圓滑的人，但郤處處歡迎圓滑，處處被圓滑所克服。</p>
<p>有一種人實骨子裏是圓滑周到，但郤裝得一本正經。這便是所謂『裏圓外方』。這種人最尖刁刻薄。普通說，明槍易躲，暗箭難防。這種人是專門放冷箭的。一般人受地的害最深，郤又最喜歡他。人們就喜歡做這種飲鴆止渴的勾常。他們愛這種人表面的方正，更愛他那種使人說不出的舒服的圓滑在骨子裏的手叚。</p>
<p>還有一種是『裏方外圓』的人。他做事從外表看起來是很圓到的，但內心郤有一個做人的準則，這是他抓住不放的。這種人是以不變應萬變。他能適應各種的環境，但一朝遇到了和他做人的準則違反的事情，他郤能毫不猶豫的加以反擊。這種人不易做，因爲外表的圓往往會把他內心的方角磨光了，也變成了圓的，結果裏裏外外都成了圓滑。反之，內心方正時，常表達到外部，往往使外表的圓也生出了頭角，成了一個裏外都是方正不阿的人，他郤又會使這個社會討厭他。做人要做到圓要圓得恰到好處，方也要方得適當，這眞是難乎其難了。</p>

<h3 id="c65">移植心贓試驗成功 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 王燕祥</p>
<p>移植暖血動物如兎子，貓，狗等的心臟，這試騐已由莫斯科高爾基醫學研究院的尼古拉。辛立慶敎授研究成功。</p>
<p>辛敎授先將動物的心臟移植到頸部，再和它的血脈系統連接，結果並無不良的影響。辛敎授現在正在進行一個長期的試騐，使動物能够具有兩個心臟，而儘可能地活着。同時他和助手正在試騐將心臟移植到動物的腹部中</p>
<p>這工作對於心臟生理學和心臟病治療學方面將有極寳貴的帮助。</p>
<p>辛敎授在蘇聯反法西斯科學協會的一篇報告中說：移植的心臟通常比原來的心臟跳動得稍慢。兎子，貓，狗等都很容易忍受這移植的手術，它們只損失少量的血，心的動作對它們毫無反響。動過手術的動物，並無呼吸急促，痙攣，或過分激動等現象，對於外來的刺激如亮光，聲音，痛楚，也有正常的反應。</p>
<p>辛敎授移植熱血動物心臟前，曾先移植冷血脊椎動物的心臟，他用一隻青蛙的心去代替另一隻靑蛙的心，許多靑蛙憑借來的心臟，都可以活過六個月以上，在春天，受過手術的雌雄靑蛙依然能够經過一個正常的配耦時期而產卵。</p>
<p>辛敎授描寫試騐靑蛙的情形，他說用顯微鏡測騐，可以看到縫合的血管完全緊合，心臟的結構也很正常。</p>
<p>當二個心在靑蛙胸內一齊跳動時，它們對於動物的身體各有不同的關係，本身的心臟對於血液有中性而諧和的關係，而移植的心臟在最初三十五天至四十天之內，只有諧和性和北學性的關係，此後，神經漸漸生長到新移植的心上。假使要用心臟藥物來試騐一個其有兩個心贓的生物的反應，也是可能的。</p>
<p>移植的心究竟可以替代原來的機體多久呢？還有，動物的神經在新的心上面生長時，心內本身的神經又將受到什麼影響呢？</p>
<p>辛教授將試騐冷血動物的成績，再去試騐兎子，貓，狗等，他發現了一種連接熱血動物血管的方法，非常簡便，在二三十秒鐘的時間內便可完成。</p>
<p>辛敎授在第一步試驗中，將心臟移植到動物的頭部，但第二個心只有右半部和動物的血管相通連，左半部並不能流通，故稱這種手術爲『半治法』。</p>
<p>經過多次觀察後，可以見到心好好地工作，且能長期生存，雖然心臟保留它自已的韻節，但對於血壓和工作能力並無反常的影響。</p>
<p>辛敎授試行第二步試騐中，將心臟移植到頸部時，使它的兩個半部都和動脈靜脈相連通，從這一次試騐，才發明了一個完備的心臟，他稱這種心臟爲『病態移植』的心臟。</p>

<p>將軍答道：「沒有一個是我信任的。最好的幾個都是在德國受訓練的，就是我給開刀開死了，他們都會認爲道次手術是成功的。我不要聽他們的意見。」他嘆息着說：「可惜我們不能將德國的不顧一切和美國的軟心腸混合起來。這樣你就可以將你的俘虜置之於法，而我可以放心不怕你在我不省人事的時候暗殺我了。」將軍笑了起來。他有一種異乎尋常的幽默感。他問：「做了一個日本人，你能不能將這兩種外國因素混合起來？」</p>
<p>貞雄微笑道：「我自己也沒把握，不過爲了你的緣故，我願意試試看，大人。」</p>
<p>將軍搖搖頭，他說：「我情願不做這試騐品。」他忽然覺得軟弱起來，一心一意衹想到他自己的生命。在這種勝利接二連三而來的時候，當一名軍官的人，對整個南太平洋的責任都是很重的。他生起氣來，說：「這人偏偏會給水冲到你的門口，眞是倒霉。</p>
<p>貞雄溫和地說：「我自己也這樣想。」</p>
<p>將軍說：「最好將地不聲不響地殺了。不是你來做，是由某一個不認識他的人來殺。我有我自己的刺客。或者今天晚上我派兩個人——或者最好是隨便那一天晚上。你一點都不必知道。如今天也暖了——你如果將那白種人所住的房間裏向花園那一面的門窗開着，那是再自然不過的事。」</p>
<p>貞雄同意道：「常然這是很自然的。事實上，門窗每晚都開着。」</p>
<p>將軍打着哈欠說：「好的。他們是很能幹的刺客——他們一點聲響都沒有，而且懂得內部流血的秘訣。如果你歡喜的話，我可以呌他們將那屍首搬掉。」</p>
<p>貞雄想了一想，想到花子，就同意道：「那樣恐怕是最好的了，大人。」商業新聞</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hurley Criticizes Career Diplomats for Undermining President Roosevelt's Instructions; Soviet Union Willing to Be at Peace with China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[United States News Agency, Washington, 6th] General Hurley, who resigned as Ambassador to China last week, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that the Soviet Union and the United States have the same attitude toward China. He stated: "The Soviet Union does not support the Chinese Communist Party, does not want a civil war in China, does not want to divide China, and wants to live in peace with China." He based his conclusion on "my conversations with Stalin and Molotov." He also praised Chairman Chiang and the National Government, saying, "China is like a wounded tiger struggling in a trap, fighting Japan alone for a very long time."</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chairman Chiang's Heroic and Unyielding Struggle for National Rights <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>China could have compromised with Japan, and in fact, the terms of compromise were exceptionally favorable. At that time, we had not yet joined the war. However, Chairman Chiang was heroic and unyielding, fighting for the rights of the nation. Hurley concluded his two-day speech to the Foreign Relations Committee by saying that he resigned because career diplomats undermined his efforts to carry out the instructions of the late President Roosevelt. He stated that President Roosevelt had instructed him to support the Chinese National Government so that Chairman Chiang's forces could continue to fight the Japanese army on the battlefield. Senator Connally, a Democrat from Texas and chairman of the committee, asked, "Were you successful?" Hurley said that he had some success, but his efforts to "unite all forces in China" were thwarted by career diplomats. Hurley had previously stated that John Service and Dean Acheson were leading figures in the State Department who were hostile to him. Today, he added another name. Connally repeatedly tried to get Hurley to reveal this name. Finally, Hurley said, "Adolph A. Berle." Berle is now Under Secretary of State and formerly served as Assistant Secretary of State. Connally asked, "What did he do?" Hurley retorted, "What did he do? I didn't want to say, but since you asked—" Hurley then detailed the history of the Iran Declaration and other American policies. (It is claimed that Hurley said that Berle and others overturned American foreign policy in Iran.) After this, Hurley accused his "political advisors, Fulton Freeman and Raymond Ludden," of not helping him carry out President Roosevelt's instructions. He also accused Acheson and Service of telling the Chinese Communist Party that Hurley did not truly represent the United States.</p>

<p>Connally asked, "How did they tell the Communist Party?" Hurley replied, "They told the Communist Party through letters, conversations, and meetings with the Communist Party." Hurley further stated that the American "multiple administrative agencies overseas and military representatives did not carry out our country's foreign policy."</p>
<p>Senator Bridges asked, "Did Lieutenant General Wedemeyer do his duty?" Hurley said, "General Wedemeyer's original contribution and loyalty are beyond reproach." He said he had gathered his subordinates and warned them that the President's instruction was that everyone should follow the government's policy during wartime, whether they agreed with it or not. Hurley added, "I think they may not agree with American policy, but since we are at war, and our policy is determined by our legitimate government, we can only implement this policy and cannot advocate for anything else."</p>
<p>Senator Wheeler asked, "Were you at that time fairly mediating between the two sides, and were they not?" Hurley replied, "Yes!" "So they were colluding with the Communists?" Hurley replied, "I cannot say that they were disloyal to us, but they believed that overthrowing Chairman Chiang was the most beneficial thing for China. I told them that the President's order was to support Chairman Chiang." Wheeler further asked, "If an ambassador's subordinates engage in such actions, should there be a remedy?" Hurley replied, "Indeed, I have dismissed them. After they returned to Washington, they became my supervisors and undermined my policy." Wheeler asked, "Who should be responsible for promoting them?" Hurley replied, "I am 13,000 miles away from my country. I cannot know everything, but the Secretary of State is traditionally the head of the State Department." After repeated questioning by Connally, Hurley admitted, "I believe that the staff in the Near East Office sincerely support the State Department's policy. Henderson, who manages the department, has supported President Truman's policy. I believe that although Under Secretary of State Berle is a major opponent of this policy, I do not know how many people in the department support him." Hurley then issued a lengthy and emotional declaration discussing human rights, the interests of democracy, the obligations of rulers, the merits of the Atlantic Charter, and the key points of the Iranian Declaration. He earnestly called for the linkage of diplomatic activities, demanded the implementation of better methods for recruiting diplomatic personnel, and praised the United Nations organization. Connally then thanked Hurley and announced that Secretary of State Byrnes would appear as a witness on the 7th.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chairman Chiang Concerned About Student Unrest; Expresses Determination to Handle it Fairly; Vice Minister of Education Chu Ching-nung Flew to Kunming Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Chairman Chiang is very concerned about the student strike in Kunming. On the afternoon of the 7th, he specially dispatched Vice Minister of Education Chu Ching-nung to Kunming to handle the matter and issued a letter to the educational community of Kunming, which was telegraphed to the authorities and faculty of various schools in Kunming, expressing that he would handle this matter fairly and urged the students to resume classes immediately. The full text is as follows: Student unrest has occurred in Kunming, and students have suspended classes for more than ten days, hindering the studies of young people and delaying the future of national construction. Thinking of this, I am deeply saddened. Our country has endured eight years of arduous war, sacrificing a great deal. Now that victory has just been realized, the opportunity for revival cannot be regained. It is right to work together with one heart and one mind, actively encouraging the work of national construction. However, rumors have spread and affected schools, leading to such unfortunate events. This is truly what pleases the enemy and saddens our loved ones. Schools are the backbone of society, and students are the foundation of national construction. The words and actions of schools and students should be models for society and are related to the lifeline of the country. They must distinguish right from wrong, recognize their responsibilities, value their studies, and abide by discipline. They must not let down the country's painstaking efforts to nurture them or violate the mission entrusted to them by the times. Chiang Kai-shek loves and protects young people as if they were his own children, and even more so because they are pure and innocent. Students have actions that harm themselves and the country. Although the War of Resistance has been won today, national affairs are difficult, and the people suffer. It is our inherent duty to maintain the stability of all order so that recovery and national construction are not hindered and the fruits of the War of Resistance can be preserved. Otherwise, I will have no way to face the heroic spirits of the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance and will betray the original intention of the teachers and students who endured hardships and relocations to support the War of Resistance. It is my duty to safeguard education and maintain discipline. I will definitely handle this incident fairly and responsibly based on right and wrong and the law, without any favoritism or leniency. However, the faculty of each school also bears a sacred responsibility to the school and the country. They should guide the students onto the right path and set an example for society. They must not allow the strike to continue and create a state of anarchy and disorder in schools and society, bringing shame to the country. At present, all problems must be resolved with the resumption of classes as a prerequisite and through normal procedures. Otherwise, no matter how much the government loves young people, it cannot abandon its duty to safeguard education and maintain order. I sincerely hope that the authorities and faculty of each school will deeply understand this intention and earnestly persuade all students to resume classes immediately and return to normalcy, and not let down my earnest expectations. Yours sincerely, Chiang Chung-cheng, December 7, 1945.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Weng Wenhao reported on the situation of taking over and handling various recovered areas at the resident committee of the Political Council on the 7th. The full text is as follows: Regarding the measures for handling enemy and puppet industries after the ceasefire, the central government has repeatedly formulated laws and regulations and has set standards for the division of labor among various agencies. Since Japan officially surrendered in August, the government has further stipulated various formal measures. The government first established special commissioner offices of various ministries in various regions as specialized management organizations for major sectors. It also established party and government takeover committees in various provinces and cities as joint consultation institutions. Subsequently, due to the need for further sorting and strengthening in the handling of various aspects, a national undertaking takeover committee was added to concentrate the promotion. The location of the committee was stipulated to be located at the headquarters of the Army General Headquarters to facilitate mutual liaison and adopt a unified attitude towards the Japanese side. In addition, enemy and puppet property handling bureaus were established in important areas, along with review committees, to concentrate the formulation of specific handling methods and ensure proper implementation. Among the handling institutions, the Shanghai area and the Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin areas have been established and are actively handling matters. Areas still under preparation include the Shandong, Qingdao, Hunan, Hubei, Wuhan, and Guangdong areas. The Executive Yuan is actively supervising and earnestly carrying out the handling work in all these areas. The Executive Yuan has formally stipulated measures for handling enemy and puppet industries in the recovered areas, ordering various ministries, commissions, provinces, and cities to follow them. The content of these measures stipulates the specific standards for various agencies to take over, keep, and utilize, for example, military supplies are assigned to the Ministry of National Defense, warships are assigned to the Navy General Headquarters, land transportation tools are assigned to the Wartime Transportation Administration, water transportation tools are assigned to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and factory, mine equipment, raw materials, and finished products are assigned to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, real estate, houses, and furniture are assigned to the Central Trust of China, etc. On the other hand, the measures stipulate the principles for handling enemy and puppet assets. For industries that originally belonged to the people of our country or friendly nations and were indeed forcibly taken over by the Japanese side, evidence should be ascertained and returned to the original owners. For equity jointly owned by Chinese and Japanese puppets, all equity shall be transferred to the central government. For property originally owned by the Japanese or acquired by Japanese puppets, the property rights shall be transferred to the central government, and they will be allocated to the National Resources Commission, the Textile Industry Management Committee, or the Ministry of Food, depending on the nature. Those not within the scope of these allocations will be auctioned off at fair prices and transferred to private operation. The area handling bureaus and review committees will investigate the specific circumstances of each case, propose handling methods, and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation in accordance with these measures. The work of taking over and handling is currently underway. The investigation and inquiry during the takeover revealed the actual ways in which Japan managed and controlled our country's economy during the war, showing the reality of their planning and utilization path. Generally speaking, it can be divided into two major periods: one is the Asia Development Board period, during which North China was placed under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Army, with army officers responsible for command in the center, and Central and South China were placed under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Navy, with naval officers leading in the center. The second is the Greater East Asia Ministry period, where the navy was no longer responsible, North China remained under the army, and Central and South China were guided by diplomats serving as ministers. As for the actual implementing agencies, the Central China Promotion Company (originally named Central China Promotion Co., Ltd.) and the North China Development Company (originally named North China Development Co., Ltd.) were the two mainstays. Both companies were Japanese legal entities established in accordance with Japanese law and were subject to the command and supervision of the Greater East Asia Ministry. The president and vice president were appointed by the Japanese government, and the directors were also subject to the instructions and approval of the Greater East Asia Ministry. The Central China Promotion Company had a capital of 100 million yen, and was authorized to issue bonds worth 500 million yen. From the establishment to the Japanese surrender, the company invested 150 million yen in Central China, accumulating to over 440 million yuan, and also ordered 45 billion yuan of puppet Central Reserve Bank notes for wartime necessities loans. The companies invested and organized by the Central China Promotion Company include: Central China Mining Company, with a capital of 4.5 billion yuan of puppet Central Reserve Bank notes; Central China Hydropower Company, with a capital of over 7.8 billion yuan; Central China Silk Company, with a capital of 1 billion yuan; Central China Aquatic Products Company, with a capital of 1.38 billion yuan; Central China Industrial Company, with a capital of 2 billion yuan; Central China Railway Company, with a capital of 47.5 billion yuan; Central China Electrical Communication Company, with a capital of 6 billion yuan; China Shipping Company, with a capital of 3 billion yuan; Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, with a capital of 2.7 billion yuan; Shanghai Hengchan Company, with a capital of 3.75 billion yuan; Greater Shanghai Gas Company, with a capital of 900 million yuan; Central China Urban Public Bus Company, with a capital of 1.2 billion yuan; Huainan Coal Refining Company, with a capital of 4.15 billion yuan.

<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] The National Army has begun to advance towards Chahar and Jehol. The Ping-Sui Railway line has advanced to Nankou, and the Ping-Je Railway line has crossed Miyun, approaching Gubeikou. The Soviet-Mongolian army in the Chahar and Jehol provinces has withdrawn, but there are still a few Soviet troops in northern Jehol and the Chahar border.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] According to Chongqing broadcast on the 7th, the Chinese Public Bulletin recently announced that the National Army has approached Shenyang, only 25 miles away. Before the military authorities of China and the Soviet Union complete negotiations, the National Army plans not to enter the city temporarily. The air force of the National Army has landed in Jinzhou.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 7th] Today, well-informed sources said that after crossing the Liao River and occupying Xinglongdian, the National Army is now approaching Wanggutan, five miles west of Shenyang. It is also said that after occupying Xinmin, Xinglongdian became another target for the National Army to advance towards Shenyang.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 7th] It is reported that the vanguard of the National Army has reached the outskirts of Shenyang and is expected to enter the city before the 10th of this month. The National Army swept 600 miles along the Beining Railway, encountering minor resistance from the Communist army, with no more than 100 National Army casualties.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Goubangzi, 7th] The vanguard of our army has crossed Goubangzi and reached villages around Liziwopu. This reporter took a train to Goubangzi on the morning of the 7th to inspect both sides of the railway. Our troops and civilians are repairing various facilities destroyed by the Communist army in the severe cold and strengthening defense work. Villages along the railway line have been looted by the Communist army and are in a state of disrepair. Upon arriving at Goubangzi Station, I went to inspect the town. According to the general public, our army has advanced rapidly, and fortunately, the town has not been destroyed. They deeply expressed their gratitude. The population of Goubangzi Town is over 30,000, and the living conditions of the people are better than those in Jinzhou. The city has returned to normal in just a few days since the National Army entered the city. The people live and work in peace and are on good terms with the National Army. However, important public and private properties, as well as gold and silver jewelry, have been looted by the Communist army. The people's resentment towards the Communist army's atrocities has reached an extreme point. The elderly said that they do not know when the private disasters they have suffered this time can be restored, and in the future, the local government will also assist the National Army with all its strength to establish permanent security. The Goubangzi Airport is of considerable scale and has not been destroyed, but more than 20 Japanese aircraft at the airport have been burned by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] Since General Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Command, arrived in Jin County on November 27, he has comforted the people, restored railway traffic, stabilized finance, and stabilized prices. Recently, great success has been achieved, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. According to reports: (1) There are about 70,000 to 80,000 National Communist troops led by Li Yunchang and Lin Biao between Qinhuangdao and Jinzhou. Last month, they hindered the National Army from proceeding to the Northeast in Guannei. After General Du personally led his troops to take over the defense from the Haiguan on November 16, the main force of the Communist army wavered. Lin Biao transferred the 132nd Division of the New Fourth Army to reinforce, but ultimately failed and fled into Jehol. West of Jin County, there are only sporadic Communist troops. According to reliable reports recently, Communist troops in various parts of the Northeast have surrendered. (2) The order in Dingzhou has now been fully restored, and merchants from neighboring counties such as Jinxi, Lianshan, and Xingcheng have come to Jin County to sell goods, and the market is extremely prosperous. (3) There are about 30,000 Japanese residents in Jinzhou, concentrated in the city. Japanese puppet women and children set up stalls to operate small businesses. Local living is 20 to 30 times cheaper than in Guannei. In terms of transportation, the Qin-Jin line has been opened to traffic. It is stipulated that there is one train between Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou every day, and passengers are extremely crowded. There is also a local train running between Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao, which is very convenient for travelers. (4) In terms of culture, General Du has always paid great attention to cultural undertakings and issues small mimeographed or lead-printed newspapers in the war zone. On the third day of entering Jin, he will issue the "New Life" eight-page lead-printed newspaper, which has sold about 20,000 copies in the past few days.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 7th] After the war, the Huainan Railway was rerouted by the enemy, with the starting point at Zhabu and the end point at Tianjia'an in Shou County. The stations passed through, such as Daqing and Jiulonggang, are all in the Huainan coal mining area. After the Japanese surrender, the road was heavily damaged by bandits, causing Huainan coal to be unable to be exported, which greatly affected transportation and industry in Central China. The Tenth War Zone Command has ordered the dispatch of its compiled troops to ensure the security along the route. Therefore, the Huainan Railway has been restored to traffic, and the coal shortage in various parts of Central China can be resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Editorial: The Fourth Anniversary of the Pacific War <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Today is a day that all people around the world should not forget, especially the citizens of Shanghai. Four years ago today, the Japanese bandits launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, initiating the Pacific War. While the Japanese bandits were digging their own graves in a frenzy, countless people around the world suffered the ravages of war as a result. Four years ago today, the Japanese bandits invaded the concessions in this city, not only becoming enemies with British and American expatriates but also completely depriving all Shanghai citizens of their freedom, treating them worse than slaves and livestock. As for our journalistic circles, from this day four years ago until the Japanese bandits surrendered this year, Shanghai had no free or independent speech. Therefore, Shanghai's journalists feel an even deeper and more painful recollection of today.</p>
<p>The Japanese chieftain Tojo launched the Pacific War, boasting it as the "Greater East Asia Holy War," starting with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, attacking the Philippines, occupying Singapore, invading Malaya, occupying the Dutch East Indies, knocking on the doors of Australia in the south, peeking through the windows of India in the west, controlling Hawaii with Guam in the east, and crossing the Kuril Islands in the north to approach Alaska, dominating the skies with an air of invincibility. However, in less than a year, they were defeated at the Coral Sea and then again at the Solomon Islands, which dampened their ferocious flames and changed the course of the war. Our great ally, the United States of America, under the successive leadership of Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, with the strategic planning of Marshal Marshall, the military preparations of Stimson, Knox, and others, the decisive victories from thousands of miles away by Generals Eisenhower, MacArthur, and others, and in close cooperation with China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, fought shoulder to shoulder for less than four years, achieving victory on both oceans, causing the Eastern and Western demons to perish together, and the three Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan to surrender unconditionally one after another. Looking back from today, the Pacific War was not only a "masterpiece" of the Japanese bandits digging their own graves but also a prelude to the collapse of the entire anti-democratic, aggressive nations. After the victory, as we encounter this startling and alarming day for the first time, we should first pay our infinite respect and condolences to the tens of thousands of Allied soldiers who bravely sacrificed themselves. The leaders of the four major Allied powers, China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, through their arduous and exceptional leadership and close, seamless cooperation, enabled the Allied forces of the democratic nations to finally achieve unprecedented victory, truly writing an indelible page in history.</p>
<p>The one who outwardly launched the Pacific War was Tojo, but in reality, it was Konoe. Konoe Fumimaro first formed a cabinet on June 1, 1937, succeeding Hayashi Senjuro, and just over a month later, he launched the July 7th Incident, initiating a full-scale invasion of China. His ambition was to follow Tanaka Giichi's strategy, conquering Manchuria and Mongolia to conquer China, and then conquering the world. The ambition of "Hakkō ichiu" (all the world under one roof) was the real cause of his launching the war against China. Although he once resigned, he became a remarried woman (a phrase meaning to return to a previous occupation) on July 17, 1940, succeeding Yonai Mitsumasa. After a year, the government collapsed, but he formed a cabinet for the third time. This should not be seen merely as Konoe being opportunistic but rather because he always妄圖貫徹查想 to implement the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" policy, wanting to start with "establishing a highly wartime system" as a method for further expanding aggression. Both his second and third cabinets had Tojo Hideki as the Army Minister, which shows that Tojo was the backbone of the Konoe Cabinet and the soul of Konoe's cabinet formation. The third Konoe Cabinet was in power for less than three months before it was transferred to Tojo. Tojo formed a cabinet in less than two months, and the great fire of the Pacific War erupted, becoming unstoppable like a prairie fire. This shows even more that Tojo's reckless actions were pioneered by Konoe. Konoe accumulated the firewood, and Tojo fanned the flames; like a flood, Konoe opened the sluice gates, and Tojo destroyed the dams. At the beginning of his three cabinet formations, Konoe himself declared his mission, saying something like, "The immutable national policy of the Empire has long been established, and today there is only one path: to rapidly move toward decisiveness." What was the immutable national policy? It was to conquer China and then conquer the world. What was rapid decisiveness? It was to act recklessly regardless of the consequences. Tojo truly and wholeheartedly inherited this mantle from him. Therefore, the culprit of the war of aggression against China was indeed Konoe, and the culprit who launched the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in the Pacific War was, besides Tojo, still Konoe. However, after the Japanese bandits surrendered, Tojo was arrested early on, while Konoe still wanted to pretend to be "democratic," posing as a moderate and stable figure, seemingly earnestly undertaking the work of revising the Japanese Constitution for the Emperor Hirohito, which was truly shameless. On the eve of the fourth anniversary of the Pacific War, we heard that Marshal MacArthur had ordered the arrest of Konoe and Kido, charging them with war crimes, which was indeed a gratifying piece of news.</p>
<p>We ourselves do not harbor the slightest narrow-minded desire for revenge, and we do not hope that there will be so-called irreconcilable "blood feuds" between people in the world. However, after a cruel war that killed millions of people, we cannot but settle the responsibility for the war. In the Pacific War, the global anti-aggression war, our democratic nations achieved a glorious victory. We can be lenient towards the innocent people of the enemy country and use education to make them a peaceful and benevolent nation again, but we must have a strict punishment for the warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians of the enemy country who launched the war, as well as the traitors and national scoundrels who flattered the enemy and betrayed the country. Otherwise, we will have no way to answer to the sacrificed soldiers, let alone to the people who have suffered greatly.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to ensure that there will never be such a cruel war in the world again, the four major Allied powers of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, as well as all the united nations, need to cooperate with the same sincerity and seamlessness in peacetime as they did in wartime. Only then can we hope that the Pacific will be permanently peaceful and that war will forever leave us!</p>

<p>[US News Agency Washington 6th] The US government is urging countries around the world to convene an international trade conference in the first half of next year to promote trade and employment. The State Department announced today that Secretary of State Byrnes has sent a proposal for holding such a conference to various governments. The preface to this document was written by Byrnes himself, and the original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The recommendations in this booklet were drafted by US experts in cooperation under the direction of Assistant Secretary of State Clayton and are intended for the reference of the American people and the governments and peoples of other countries in preparation for the convening of an international trade and employment conference. The meeting based on the recommendations in this booklet should be held as soon as possible. Countries are now considering the trade policies to be adopted after the war, and these policies urgently need to reach mutual agreement to prevent the world from being divided into several economic groups. Therefore, the US government firmly believes that this conference convened by the United Nations should be held no later than the summer of 1946, and the US representatives serving in the United Nations agencies will do their utmost to achieve this.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 6th] The US government announced yesterday the Anglo-American loan agreement, and at the same time, it released a white paper strongly opposing high tax rates, trade preferences, and monopolies. It proposed that negotiations should begin before the international conference is held, to universally reduce tariffs and remove other barriers, as a collective action to prevent economic warfare is necessary to supplement the efforts of the United Nations to prevent military warfare.</p>

<p>[Reuters London 7th] A spokesman for the Indian League, Krishna, claimed yesterday that it was regrettable that the British Labour government's declaration did not mention India's independence and self-government. We believe that the Indian problem arises from the flaws in British policy itself, not from any misunderstanding by the Indians of that policy. Moreover, this declaration is merely a reiteration of the Cripps proposals, without any historically forward-looking action, which is truly disappointing. If the Labour government is wise, it should immediately change its current policy and establish an administrative organ trusted by the people, so that law and order can be relied upon to be restored. The Indian people feel that this British government's declaration is particularly unsuited to the current stage of India. The declaration does not even touch on the situation of the Indian elections.</p>

<p>[United Press Tokyo 7th] American reparations commissioner Pauley stated that he has recommended to President Truman that all of Japan's foreign assets, as well as most of its chemical, steel, and shipbuilding capabilities, be confiscated, and that the power and machinery industries be reduced by half, so that Japan will not be able to rebuild for war. The countries that have suffered can simultaneously be compensated. Some of this industrial equipment can be dismantled and shipped to other countries, which would be welcomed by China and the Philippines. All of Japan's gold and precious metals can be sent to the San Francisco Mint for temporary storage, and the disposal method will be discussed later. What Japan has left can be used to help other countries in Asia that lack it, which can improve the latter's standard of living. This work must begin as soon as shipping becomes convenient.</p>

<p>[Reuters Manila 7th] Yamashita Tomoyuki, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese army stationed in the Philippines, was accused of committing sixty-four crimes. After nearly six weeks of trial, he was sentenced to death today. Before the verdict was announced, Yamashita said, "I stand here, asking myself with a clear conscience, I can swear to God that I am innocent." When he was escorted back after hearing the verdict, he seemed somewhat distracted. The courtroom was crowded today. Major General Reynold資, Chairman of the War Crimes Commission, announced the judgment for thirteen minutes, stating briefly, "The committee concludes that your subordinates have committed serious atrocities and other crimes throughout the Philippines, and these are not intermittent occurrences, but mostly organized supervision and implementation. You failed to effectively control your subordinates, so after a secret written vote, the committee decided that you are indeed guilty and sentenced to hanging." The defendant's lawyer sent an appeal to the US Supreme Court by airmail this morning, requesting a review of the case.</p>
<p>[Reuters New York 7th] News from Tokyo today said: The trial of Japanese war criminals is scheduled to begin next month. Tojo Hideki, the Japanese Prime Minister at the time of the Pearl Harbor incident, will be among the first to be tried.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 7th] MacArthur's special advisor Keenan declared today: Japanese war criminals must be punished and humiliated so that future generations will see them as ordinary and most lowly criminals. It is essential to punish these leaders now, because we are now facing a third war, and there is a risk of fundamentally losing our culture, so we have to take action. Keenan declined to answer the question of the United Nations' attitude towards Emperor Hirohito of Japan. The large number of war suspects will be tried in batches by courts appointed by MacArthur, and other countries will be invited to appoint judges to participate. The arrest warrants for Konoe and Kido and the appointment of Chief Prosecutor Keenan today have made the Japanese people fully aware that the United Nations is seriously prosecuting Japanese war criminals. This order has included all war criminals close to the throne, leaving only the Japanese Emperor himself not arrested. The release of this order will have extremely serious consequences for domestic politics in Japan. Japan itself should also investigate the process of leading people to war.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo 7th Special Dispatch] Keenan told reporters: All countries concerned have been invited to participate in the war crimes trials that are about to begin in Tokyo, and all rights of other countries will also be respected during the trials.</p>

It has now submitted to the Ministry of Finance, stating briefly: "After the war, the remaining weaving machines of various factories in the industry are unable to resume work, and funds are exhausted, relying entirely on financial turnover. Banks are the core of finance. Before the war, there were no fewer than forty or fifty existing banks and stores, but they are still closed. If we want to revitalize the industry, we should ask the Four Banks and the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank to come to Wujin to resume operations as soon as possible," and so on.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Washington 6th Special Dispatch] China once again occupied a prominent position in this investigation as Marshall testified before the Congressional Pearl Harbor Incident Investigation Committee today. When answering questions, Marshall said: Chiang Kai-shek asked the United States for assistance in early November 1941, fearing that the Japanese army would attack Kunming and the Yunnan-Burma Road. When asked what he did at the time, Marshall replied: He did not agree to send US troops to China, nor did he issue an ultimatum to Japan. However, he decided to strengthen the American Volunteer Group "Flying Tigers" and suggested that once the Japanese army crossed a certain border in Thailand, the United States would take countermeasures and warn Japan that further aggression would lead to war. However, he did not remember whether this warning was issued. Marshall also said: He could speak Chinese and had served in China for three years.</p>
<h3 id="e29">American Industrial Secrets to be Sold Abroad at a Price <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 6th] It is heard that American "industrial secrets" will be sold abroad at a price. A number of retired officials, bankers, and industrialists here are planning to establish branches in Britain, South Africa, India, and various parts of Europe under the name of "Overseas Company." The Australian office has already been established. The company's business policy is to assist American manufacturers in providing industrial technology and manufacturing methods to foreign countries, and to import foreign manufacturing methods suitable for use in the United States. For example, steel mills destroyed in foreign countries during the war can learn about the latest methods and uses of American mass steelmaking. Film companies can learn about the latest manufacturing, management, and distribution techniques in Hollywood. The manufacturing of automobiles, trucks, airplanes, washing machines, electrical appliances, etc., can also be exchanged at extremely low prices for the knowledge accumulated by American industry in the past twenty years, especially during the war, such as management organization, efficiency, manufacturing, and sales. As for the fee standard, it has not yet been determined and will be based on the following two factors: (1) the type of industry, the work done, and the length of service; (2) the paying ability, profits earned, and future prospects of the benefiting company, and the value of the exchange service to the American company.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Hong Kong University, the Only British University in the Far East - A Perspective <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Leda Guan</p>
<p>Britain has three directly governed colonial universities: one is the University of Malta, established in 1769, one is the University of Gibraltar, established in 1925, and the other is Hong Kong University.</p>
<p>Hong Kong University was founded in 1907 by Sir Frederick Lugard, Governor of Hong Kong, and officially established in 1911. Its purpose, it is said, was to adapt to the new trends of thought in the world and to provide the young Chinese in Hong Kong with new knowledge.</p>
<p>Initially, the Hong Kong government donated 1.7 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately 200,000 pounds). Later, Sir Paul Chater, a wealthy American in Hong Kong, donated 26,000 pounds, the Rockefeller Foundation, an American oil tycoon, donated 80,000 pounds, and Messers John Swire &amp; Sons donated 40,000 pounds, all of which were designated as the Hong Kong University Fund and deposited in the bank to generate interest. The annual interest on this fund, HK$369,260, together with the British government's annual subsidy of HK$350,000, was used as the university's annual expenses.</p>
<p>Before the war, Hong Kong University had three colleges: Arts, Engineering, and Commerce. The Arts and Engineering colleges were completed in four years, and the elective courses were limited to six years. Co-education was practiced. Each student paid HK$400 per year for tuition and HK$300 for room and board. At that time, the fees were considered too expensive, becoming aristocratic, and unaffordable for the younger siblings of wealthy or middle-class families. Of the 400 male and female students in the university, most were from Hong Kong or Guangdong, and many were sent to study by the children of overseas Chinese from the Malay Peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>As for the school buildings, in addition to classrooms and various offices, there were six male dormitories and one female dormitory, as well as a large library with 80,000 volumes, almost half of which were Chinese books.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has a mild climate, with spring-like weather all year round. Because it is located on the route to Southeast Asia and is also one of the world's best naval ports, the university grasped the authority of the British Far East naval base and enhanced its international status. On December 8, 1941, when the Pacific War broke out, Hong Kong was tragically captured, and it is heard that the university also suffered considerable losses.</p>
<p>Now that the war is over, the National Government will resolve the Hong Kong issue through diplomatic means. It is not known what the future status of Hong Kong University, the only British university in the Far East, will be.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Amendment to the Regulations for Punishing Traitors; Changes in Penalties; Appeals Allowed Against Judgments <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from This City] Amidst the nationwide demand for the swift prosecution of traitors, the Regulations for Punishing Traitors have been revised and promulgated. Our reporter interviewed Xiang Zherong, Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Shanghai High Court, to inquire about his opinion on these regulations.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang immediately pointed out that after the revision of the regulations, there was a significant change, that is, the original regulations stipulated that the penalties for punishing traitors were only death penalty and life imprisonment. Now, for those with lighter circumstances, a fixed-term imprisonment of more than five years may be imposed. When handling traitor cases, in addition to the regulations, the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, the Criminal Law, or other laws may also be applied. However, if there is a conflict in the provisions of each law, Mr. Xiang stated that the principle of "later law prevails over earlier law" should be followed, and the latest promulgated law should be adopted. As for how to deal with foreigners who collude with the enemy or rebel, Mr. Xiang said that before the Anti-Japanese War, the Soviet Union and Germany had abandoned consular jurisdiction. Later, when the United Kingdom and the United States signed new treaties, they also expressed their abandonment of this privilege. Therefore, if the nationals of these countries commit criminal acts, they should also be dealt with by our courts. Currently, the number of traitor cases transferred by the arresting agencies to the prosecutor's office of the High Court is only about 40. About seven or eight cases have been disposed of. Except for a part that is not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence of crime, about four or five cases have been filed for public prosecution. The reporter also inquired with Mr. Xiang about the rumor that defendants in traitor cases were not allowed to enjoy the right to legal representation during trial. Mr. Xiang replied that there was no such provision and that defendants could also appeal to the Supreme Court if they disagreed with the judgment.</p>
<p>Ding Guanping, a Traitor, Tried Yesterday</p>
<p>Ding Guanping, the former "Chairman of the Food Management Committee of the Puppet Ministry of Food," was arrested by the authorities and detained for more than a month. He was publicly tried by the Second Criminal Court of the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Judge Sun Pengxian inquired about his age and origin. Ding replied that he was 40 years old, from Hangzhou. When asked why he participated in the puppet organization, Ding excused himself by saying that transportation was blocked and he was burdened by his family. Asked how long he had served in the "Ministry of Food," he replied that he had served as "Chairman of the Food Management Committee" since its establishment on December 8, 1941, until he resigned in March 1943. On February 21, 1945, he served as the "Warden of the Detention Center of the Local Prosecutor's Office." Asked whether he had harmed Chinese people during his tenure, he replied that when he was in the "Ministry of Food," the rice in various districts of Yangzhou was only used for the local people. When he was the warden of the detention center, he tried to ensure that the prisoners had sufficient food. Because the documents submitted by Ding were mostly forged, the judge asked how much property he had in total. He replied that his assets were worth 40 to 50 million yuan in puppet currency. The court ordered further investigation and adjourned the hearing to be held again in seven days.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Du Yuesheng Broadcast Last Night; Supporting Chairman Chiang's Economic Construction Policy <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>From 7:45 PM to 8:00 PM yesterday, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, gave a speech at the Shanghai Radio Station at the invitation of the Central Broadcasting Administration Office, entitled "Supporting Chairman Chiang's Economic Construction Policy."</p>
<p>Mr. Du first said that he had been missing his elders and fellow villagers for eight years. During his stay in Chongqing, he engaged in economic and financial undertakings under the premise of resisting Japan and building the nation. He once inspected the Northwest and felt that it was in urgent need of development. At the beginning of June of this year, he discussed with Chairman Chiang and went to the Southeast to take up his work. He left Chongqing on June 25 and arrived in Chun'an, Zhejiang on July 16. On August 11, the Japanese surrendered. He returned to Shanghai on September 3.</p>
<p>Chairman's Instructions Emphasize Support</p>
<p>Recently, Chairman Chiang announced the economic policies for the period of national construction and established the Supreme Economic Council. The goal revealed in Chairman Chiang's instructions is to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and do everything possible to restore domestic order and security. From Chairman Chiang's instructions, we can find that the government will improve transportation, cultivate talents, and correct bad habits for industry and commerce. For agriculture, it will reduce land rent and usury to improve the lives of farmers. Other measures, such as stabilizing the currency system and encouraging foreign trade, are concrete ways to realize the policy. The principles revealed by President Song emphasize that the government should support the people in developing the economy. We should do our best within the scope of the government's economic policies under the guidance of Chairman Chiang and President Song, in order to achieve self-reliance. Shanghai, which has always been the leader in industry and commerce nationwide, should unanimously support it.</p>
<p>Hurry Up Production and Do Not Stop</p>
<p>I also have a small opinion. After eight years of devastation and destruction by the enemy, the losses are incalculable. It will take more than ten or twenty years to recover. Therefore, after the victory, we must hurry up production and not allow any short-term stagnation. It is heard that in North China alone, a one-day work stoppage results in a loss of 600 million yuan. This is a huge figure. How can we tolerate such a significant loss?</p>
<p>Shanghai Prices Are Falling Consistently</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the prices in this city, I would like to report: In Chairman Chiang's instructions to the Supreme Economic Council, the phrase "do everything possible to restore domestic order and security" also includes the issue of prices. From the perspective of construction, being active is building, and being passive is stabilization. Since President Song's visit to Shanghai, the mayor and relevant authorities have tried to stabilize prices. Liu, the bureau chief, has quickly handled the sealed materials and gradually released them. The various industries in Shanghai have also been able to uphold the Chairman's virtues and have been able to persuade each other. Therefore, prices have recently fallen consistently. It can be seen that with the government leading from above and the people cooperating from below, the effect is doubled with half the effort.</p>
<p>Universally Comply with Fairness, Justice, and Integrity</p>
<p>In short, the post-war period is more difficult than the war period. At this time, we must not only learn from our pain, but also accept the suffering that must be experienced in the period of national construction with a spirit of great selflessness. Chairman Chiang also said in his instructions to the Supreme Economic Council, "What is needed at this time is that all public and private life must be absolutely fair, just, and honest. This is an important moment in our history. We must absolutely not tolerate slow, corrupt, or selfish people who exploit the people in order to seek personal wealth." These words are certainly intended to encourage those in power, but we citizens should also take them as a lesson and universally comply with them. I am willing to encourage myself with you all.</p>
<h3 id="e45">US Military Police Pay Attention to Military Accidents <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, US military trucks and jeeps in this city have often caused accidents. Colonel Brown of the US Military Police told our reporter yesterday that the US military headquarters is also paying close attention to this incident and has already established rules for vehicle driving. The speed of each vehicle must not exceed 15 miles per hour. Violators will be suspended from driving for 30 days. If there are injuries or other incidents, in addition to compensating for the losses, they must also be subject to military court martial. As for the hired drivers, if they violate the rules, they can be reported to the Police Bureau and transferred to the US Military Police for investigation. They may be dismissed immediately, or handed over to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation, or ordered to compensate for the losses.</p>
<p>Colonel Brown also said that the most difficult thing at present is reporting the accident vehicle without knowing the number, which makes the investigation very difficult. Therefore, he hopes that in the future, if a vehicle accident occurs, those who witness it should immediately record the number and report it to the Military Police Team on Chengdu Road or the Military Police Headquarters on Hamiloden Road on Jiangxi Road, so that an investigation can be carried out. On the one hand, he has repeatedly warned the drivers to be careful and there are slogans posted on each vehicle to alert them.</p>

<p>[Special Report by this Newspaper] Mr. Dai Gengxin, a representative of cigarette factories in Shanghai, went to Chongqing in the middle of last month to discuss issues related to Shanghai cigarette factories with the central authorities. He has now returned to Shanghai in recent days. According to Mr. Dai, during his discussions with President Song and relevant officials in Chongqing, the results were very satisfactory. It is said that President Song has agreed that more than two hundred small factories in Shanghai can register with the government in accordance with the law and be allowed to continue operations. Mr. Dai stated to President Song that the proliferation of hand-rolled cigarettes is affecting the sales of factory-made cigarettes. It has now been decided to raise the tax rate on hand-rolled cigarettes to one hundred percent, equal to the tax rate on factory-made cigarettes. As for the three major cigarette factories in Shanghai (Nanyang, Yizhong, and Huacheng), they are all facing difficulties due to major problems such as raw materials and transportation, and it will be difficult to resume operations within two or three months. The government will do its best to assist within the possible range, so that they can resume operations as soon as possible.</p>

<p>To the Editor: We are workers who have served at the General Electric Edison Light Bulb Factory for more than ten years. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the factory has been occupied by Japanese invaders. Some of the workers were laid off by the factory at that time and have been struggling for four years. In order to obtain the righteous victory of the War of Resistance, we have lingered and moaned in the depths of despair, living an inhuman life. Fortunately, our supreme leader, with his fearless spirit, has overcome the tyranny of power, and the light of victory has illuminated the whole country. Every person is celebrating the victory with joy. Our workers were dissatisfied with the flag-raising celebration by the agent of the factory (Danish nationality), and the general manager ordered a strike. As a result, after mediation by the authorities, our workers, for the sake of the country's future and the entire society, have always silently endured and accepted the conditions of the capitalists. Each worker received 250 pairs of light bulbs as severance pay. The factory manager certified that it was not a separation from Edison, and hoped that the workers would wait patiently and quietly, and that they would resume work in at most a week. Sir, please think, it has been more than two months now. The mere 250 light bulbs have long been sold for a pittance for daily living. Under the current social living conditions, what kind of life are our workers living? However, in this situation where we have "no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth," we are grateful that the authorities do not abandon us and convened two talks between labor and management. As a result, the factory twice refused to attend. If this continues, hundreds of our workers will become war victims. (Omitted) We have no choice but to implore you, sir, to appeal to the society on behalf of our hundreds of workers. I think that the wise authorities and righteous people who care about the people's suffering, hearing the cries for help from our compatriots who are about to starve to death, will surely use their righteous spirit to rescue the starving people in difficulty. Sincerely, All Workers Representatives of General Electric Edison Light Bulb Factory, Wang Xinhe, et al.</p>

<p>In order to avoid traffic congestion on Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road, the Shanghai Police Department and the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau will implement one-way traffic from December 8th. The procedures are as follows: (1) Open Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road specifically for vehicles traveling westward and eastward. All types of vehicles traveling on Jiujiang Road should travel westward, and vehicles traveling on Hankou Road should travel eastward. (Vehicles with passengers, except motor vehicles) may travel on the aforementioned roads. Unladen vehicles on the aforementioned roads should follow specific regulations and travel to the nearest intersection. (The effective time for the above one-way traffic procedure is from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM every morning.) (2) Manage motor vehicle parking regulations on Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road. All types of motor vehicles parked on Jiujiang Road (from the Bund to Xizang Road) should be parked on the north side of the road, facing west. Those parked on Hankou Road (from Henan Road to Xizang Road) should be parked on the south side of the road, facing east. No vehicles are allowed to park in the opposite direction.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Four Years Ago Today: A Recollection of a Record of Blood and Tears <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>In this newspaper published early in the morning four years ago today, there was a small piece of final news that said: "At about 4:30 this morning, there was a sudden sound of artillery fire from the east end of the Huangpu River. After about a quarter of an hour, black smoke rose in the sky, mixed with the sound of machine guns. Residents were awakened from their dreams..."</p>
<p>The dawn of the 8th was still dark, and intense artillery fire suddenly erupted on the tranquil Huangpu River. The British warship "Petrel" became a victim of the "sneak attack" by the Japanese garrison in Shanghai. The American gunboat "Wake," anchored nearby, realizing that the situation was over, peacefully raised the white flag. This was the prelude to the Japanese garrison in Shanghai entering the concessions that day.</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM, batches of Japanese troops from Hongkou passed through the Sichuan Road Bridge, heading towards the Suzhou Creek. All important public utilities, military and government agencies, and all agencies deemed necessary to occupy were seized and closed by them in one or two hours. Then, imposing announcements from the Japanese army and navy were posted all over the city.</p>
<p>Initially, some people suspected that the sounds of guns and artillery on the Huangpu River were an exercise, but later it became clear that this was wrong. The so-called "imperial army" occupying the concessions was already everywhere.</p>
<p>That night in Shanghai, in contrast to the past prosperity and luxury, everything became silent and eerie, making people shudder.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the third day (the 10th). Around nine o'clock, the banks opened one after another, but it was a flash in the pan, and they closed their doors again an hour later. After that, business hours were reduced to three hours a day, with a limit of 500 yuan for each household's withdrawals and deposits. The market temporarily came to a standstill, and Shanghai's small economic circle was completely under the control of the devil's claws.</p>
<p>Along with this, there was a major panic over rice. "Where can rice be bought?" Almost everyone was asking this question. To buy two liters of rice, they almost had to risk their lives to struggle.</p>
<p>Following the shortage of grain came a severe shortage of fuel. Coal and coal balls were restricted from transportation from the 10th, and all gasoline in the city was sealed off one after another. From the 12th, the operating hours of buses were shortened, and the number of streetcar trips was also reduced accordingly. Xiang Sheng, Yun Fei, Tai Lai, and Silver, the four major taxi companies, all stopped operating from the 13th, and all private cars were soon prohibited from driving. All of this was nothing more than the enemy's attempt to plunder some of the remaining fuel and paralyze the entire city's transportation.</p>
<p>This endless record of blood and tears can be said to be unbearable to recount. This newspaper, due to its "advocacy of resistance against Japan," had long been noticed by the Japanese army. After the Japanese army occupied the concessions, taking over this newspaper was expected. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army came to this building with a full complement of assault equipment, as if facing a major enemy. This building, without hesitation, announced its glorious suspension of publication with the first edition of the "24337" newspaper published that day (the 8th). However, at the time of suspension, we shared the firm belief of the general public of Shanghai that the victory of the motherland's resistance war was one step closer, and that the restoration of Shanghai would be quick to follow. Our glorious resumption of publication was just around the corner. Now, as expected, the War of Resistance has been won, and this newspaper also resumed its publication on the 22nd of last month with the "24338" issue. However, the future of nation-building and the revitalization of Shanghai still require redoubled efforts! (Canglong)</p>

<h3 id="e64">Round and Square <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Tradition First</p>
<p>The more one lives, the more one feels that being a person is difficult, especially in today's Chinese society. If you are too upright, you will not be able to succeed in everything, and people will be annoyed by you. If you are too smooth, people will say that you are not sincere and will not trust you in everything. However, generally speaking, in today's Chinese society, being round is easier to succeed than being square. "Being round" means that as long as you are smooth, you can go everywhere without encountering obstacles. It's like a round ball, even if there is an obstacle in the way, it can still roll past it. "Being square" means that if you do things too squarely, you will be asked to stand at attention at any time. When we throw a square block of wood on the ground, it will at most roll once or twice and then stop moving. This society does not seem to trust smooth people, but welcomes smoothness everywhere and is overcome by smoothness everywhere.</p>
<p>There is a type of person who is smooth and considerate in their bones, but pretends to be serious. This is what is called "round inside and square outside." This type of person is the most cunning and harsh. Generally speaking, it is easy to dodge a spear in the open, but difficult to defend against an arrow in the dark. This type of person specializes in shooting cold arrows. Most people suffer the most from them, but they like them the most. People like to engage in this type of drinking poison to quench thirst. They love the superficial uprightness of this type of person, and they love even more the comfortable smoothness in the bones that makes people unable to describe.</p>
<p>There is also a type of person who is "square inside and round outside." They appear to be very smooth on the outside, but inside they have a principle of being a person that they hold on to. This type of person uses constancy to respond to all changes. They can adapt to various environments, but once they encounter something that violates their principle of being a person, they can unhesitatingly counterattack. This type of person is not easy to be, because the roundness of the exterior often wears away the squareness of their hearts, and they also become round, and in the end they become smooth both inside and out. Conversely, when the heart is square, it is often expressed externally, which often makes the roundness of the exterior also sprout corners, becoming a person who is square and unyielding both inside and out, and this in turn will make this society dislike them. To be a person, to be round, one must be round just right, and to be square, one must also be square appropriately. This is truly difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Successful Heart Transplant Experiment <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yanxiang</p>
<p>The experiment of transplanting the heart of warm-blooded animals such as rabbits, cats, and dogs has been successfully researched by Professor Nikolai Sinlitsin of the Moscow Gorky Medical Research Institute.</p>
<p>Professor Xin first transplanted the animal's heart to the neck and then connected it to its blood system. As a result, there were no adverse effects. Professor Xin is now conducting a long-term experiment to enable animals to have two hearts and live as long as possible. At the same time, he and his assistants are experimenting with transplanting the heart into the animal's abdomen.</p>
<p>This work will be of extremely valuable help in the fields of cardiac physiology and cardiology.</p>
<p>In a report to the Soviet Anti-Fascist Scientific Association, Professor Xin said: The transplanted heart usually beats slightly slower than the original heart. Rabbits, cats, dogs, etc. can easily tolerate this transplant surgery. They only lose a small amount of blood, and the heart's action has no reaction on them. The operated animals do not have symptoms such as shortness of breath, convulsions, or excessive excitement, and they also have normal responses to external stimuli such as light, sound, and pain.</p>
<p>Before transplanting the heart of warm-blooded animals, Professor Xin first transplanted the heart of cold-blooded vertebrates. He used a frog's heart to replace another frog's heart. Many frogs can live for more than six months with the transplanted heart. In the spring, the operated male and female frogs are still able to go through a normal mating period and lay eggs.</p>
<p>Professor Xin described the experiment with frogs, saying that when tested with a microscope, it can be seen that the sutured blood vessels are completely tight, and the structure of the heart is also very normal.</p>
<p>When two hearts beat together in the chest of a frog, they have different relationships with the animal's body. The heart itself has a neutral and harmonious relationship with the blood, while the transplanted heart only has a harmonious and North-learning relationship within the first thirty-five to forty days. After that, nerves gradually grow onto the newly transplanted heart. It is also possible to use cardiac drugs to test the reaction of a living thing that has two hearts.</p>
<p>How long can the transplanted heart ultimately replace the original organism? Also, when animal nerves grow on the new heart, what effect will the heart's own nerves have?</p>
<p>Professor Xin will use the results of the experiment with cold-blooded animals to test rabbits, cats, dogs, etc. He discovered a method of connecting the blood vessels of warm-blooded animals, which is very simple and can be completed in twenty or thirty seconds.</p>
<p>In the first step of the experiment, Professor Xin transplanted the heart to the animal's head, but only the right half of the second heart was connected to the animal's blood vessels, and the left half could not circulate, so this surgery is called the "half-treatment method."</p>
<p>After many observations, it can be seen that the heart works well and can survive for a long time. Although the heart retains its own rhythm, it has no abnormal effect on blood pressure and working ability.</p>
<p>In the second step of the experiment, when Professor Xin transplanted the heart to the neck, he connected both halves of it to the arteries and veins. From this experiment, he invented a complete heart, which he called the "pathological transplanted" heart.</p>

<p>— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>The general replied, "I don't trust any of them. The best ones were all trained in Germany. Even if I die during surgery, they would still think the operation was a success. I don't want to hear their opinions." He sighed and said, "It's a pity we can't mix the recklessness of Germany with the softheartedness of America. That way, you could bring your prisoner to justice, and I could rest assured that you wouldn't assassinate me while I was unconscious." The general laughed. He had an extraordinary sense of humor. He asked, "As a Japanese man, can you mix these two foreign elements?"</p>
<p>Zhenxiong smiled, "I'm not sure myself, but for your sake, I am willing to try, sir."</p>
<p>The general shook his head, he said, "I'd rather not be the test subject." He suddenly felt weak and thought only of his own life. During this succession of victories, the responsibility of an officer for the entire South Pacific is very heavy. He got angry and said, "It's bad luck that this person would be washed up on your doorstep."</p>
<p>Zhenxiong said gently, "I think so too."</p>
<p>The general said, "It's best to kill him quietly. Not by you, but by someone who doesn't know him. I have my own assassins. Or I'll send two people tonight—or preferably any night. You don't need to know anything. Now that it's getting warmer—if you leave the doors and windows on the garden side of the white man's room open, that would be the most natural thing to do."</p>
<p>Zhenxiong agreed, "Of course, that is very natural. In fact, the doors and windows are open every night."</p>
<p>The general yawned and said, "Good. They are very capable assassins—they make no noise and know the secret of internal bleeding. If you like, I can have them move the body."</p>
<p>Zhenxiong thought for a moment, thinking of Hanako, and agreed, "That would probably be best, sir." Commercial News</p>

<p>Stock Trading Gradually Becomes Quiet</p>
<p>Gold: Yesterday, the overall trend gradually stabilized. Although there were still disturbances at noon, the shorts covered as soon as prices fell, resulting in a relatively stable situation, roughly the same as the previous close. In fact, apart from various merchants selling physical goods, speculators were wary at this low price. The general psychological perception is still that the exchange rate between US dollars and gold is based on an unwritten rule of six hundred to ten taels. Even if the US dollar is quoted at one thousand to one, the price of gold can still reach 600,000 due to arbitrage. Although the shorts are constantly increasing pressure, the situation has gradually stabilized due to purchases by banks. In the future, it is feared that it will still be a sideways market. Silverware was retreated to 74,000 yesterday, refined silver 650, silver dollars are still below 460, and underground discounts are about 10-13%.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Continued to be weak. The US dollar once retreated to below 1110 yuan at the weakest time at noon. Later, it improved slightly due to the recovery of the gold market. As a result, it fell slightly by two yuan compared with the previous close. Hong Kong dollar quoted that the city seems to be more prosperous, calculated about 10% to 20% higher than the market, buyers are quite active, old banknotes once approached 230 yuan, new banknotes 65 yuan, later prices fell at noon due to the softness of gold prices and the US dollar, the results are still stable, old banknotes are up by 5 yuan compared to the previous close, and new banknotes are up by 1 yuan, British pound is about 2500, Robbie is 220.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: People in the industry continue to hype up, initially flat then firm, and as a result, the various debts continued to rise by 5 yuan to 40 yuan. The overall trend is still stable, but there was some profit-taking at the close. Transactions, except for the C-E series, A-B series were very quiet, and the D series had almost no formal trading except for bidding.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: Trading is gradually becoming quiet, but the demand and supply are still relatively stable. The price fluctuates with the gold market. As a result, large-cap stocks are relatively flat, while small-cap stocks fell by 5%. Foreign stocks were not active due to the relationship between the gold market and the US dollar. As a result, the increase and decrease compared to the previous close were minimal, and the turnover was limited.</p>
<p>Rice and Grains: The rice market opened with a strong rally yesterday morning, but due to sluggish actual sales, it weakened at noon. As a result, it rose slightly by 300-400 yuan, Zhongguan increased by 500-600 yuan, and Baiyuan also increased by 500 yuan. However, it is heard that the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food has handled large quantities of rice in Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou, and part of it has been transported by China Merchants Group, with several batches arriving in Shanghai in recent days. Flour exports are still good, retail sales have become active, and prices have risen by 100-200 yuan. The oil market rose by 2,000 yuan following the market, soybeans rebounded by 200-300 yuan, and soybean cakes rose by 100-200 yuan.</p>
