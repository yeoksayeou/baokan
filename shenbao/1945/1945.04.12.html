<h3>日陸海軍特別攻擊隊　繼續猛攻敵艦船　琉球島日軍突奪回高地</h3>
<p>東京十一日中天社電　日陸·海靈特別攻擊隊，九日夜至十日黎明之間，對冲繩西方海上之美艦船加以猛攻，因值深夜，致戰果未詳，然據陸上望見之攻擊情形，業巳予敵重創。一方日海軍特攻隊對嘉手納西方海面之美艦船勇敢肉搏，而獲得擊破驅逐艦一艘，大型魚雷艇二艘，大火柱三條之戰果。</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　琉球本島西岸地區之日軍，九日對進入嘉數方面之敵加以猛烈反攻，將其擊退至大山南方八五高地，更於九日夜以大部隊突行夜閭突擊，激戰徹脊，至十日上午九時許，將敵元全驅逐，奪回該高地。東海岸地區之敵，以有力之部隊來攻津覇西南一百五十五高地，九日晚該高地曾一度陷入敵手，經該方面所在之日軍部隊發動猛烈反攻，終於是日夜將之奪回。一方名護　岸名護方面，敵曾於七日晚以戰車一百三十輛，兵員約五千名試行登陸，然經所在之日軍擱置其戰車三十三輛。又八日晨敵於津堅島以步兵一大隊登陸後，正午似又增加大隊。</p>
<h3>冲繩周邊敵艦船擊沉毀近三百艘　愛塞克斯號航空母艦已擊沉</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　冲繩周圍敵軍，不僅於該島登陸，即慶良間列島，神山為，前島，津堅島等亦先後登陸，大批兵員刻正力謀增援與補充，然其艦船亦屢遭日軍猛攻而受重創。自敵侵犯冲繩以來，二旬間，日方擊況毀敵艦船二百八十七艘，戰果偉大，而日方之總攻，此乃為初步，迨第二，第三階段決議時，敵軍損害實更重大也。敵機動部隊之太平洋作戰，在冲繩周邊已一敗塗地，今後日陸·海軍將益舉其全力，續予重創，可預卜也。</p>
<p>琉球羣島甚地十一日中央社電　日軍於六日至七日間，猛攻敵機動部隊時，所擊況之敵艦中，經其後調查，始知擊沉之空母，包括有巡洋艦改裝之朗哥雷號，制式空母愛塞克斯號，特設空母希資巴號三艘。</p>
<p>[P某軍事當局談　日必勝理由</p>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　今據某軍事當局稱：此次大東亞戰爭之最後勝利，必將歸於日本無疑，余之作此斷定理由有三：其一，為日本已決定採取「出血戰術」。本來為國從軍，在近代戰爭中，往往未必犧牲生命，英美人之從軍觀念，不過利用極其精密之飛極或戰車出征，心中必有安全退伍之希望，換言之，英美人雖可為國戰爭，而未可為國犧甡，但此次日本以「出血戰術」對英美，以致使英美到處大出血，英美人不怕軍器之損失，惟怕血液與生命之犧牲，據美當局之發表，截至最近，已有一百萬人以上之犧牲，英國亦在此數目以上，因此，最近半年以來，英美人之戰爭觀念，已發生動搖，尤其軍人對於素來所未預料之「出血戰術」，殊感恐慌。其二，日本能以衆敵寡。按英美或能以十萬軍登陸日本土，但日本必能以國內數百萬大軍對之邀擊，各島嶼之衆寡不敵之戰爭，必在日本本土發現其相反之現象。倘英美在中國登陸，亦必遭同探之命運，我人不得忘却中國大陸日軍之雄厚勢力，其數目大約有數百萬之衆，各種軍火早已開始在當地自給自足。其三，日本必以長期戰術擊滅英美。日本自數年前已決定採取長期戰略，各種軍火工廠分設於滿洲·中國大陸及南洋各地，日軍必能以此對抗英美之反攻。英美於東亞所能利用於反攻者，僅為飛機與軍艦，但此兩項不足以作最後之決戰，戰勝，件之最重要者，為以優勢陸軍攻入敵國，但此項作戰在英美極為困難，長期戰之後，英美國民必感厭戰，且對於戰爭目的必起懷疑，最後必尋一和平方式。</p>
<h3>日隨時召集　夜間閣議</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　鈴木內閣鑒於現下戰局之情勢，急須決定完遂決戰施策之大方針，特在十日定例閣議決定，除定例閣議以外，尙須隨時召集夜間閣議與閣員懇談會，所以擇時間於夜問者，乃以白晝各省大臣皆傾注全力執行政務，比較空閒僅在夜間，俾可乘此夜深人靜，相互商討政府應行之根本方針。</p>
<h3>大日本政治會幹部人選決定</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　大日本政治會幹部人選，前經南總裁縝密銓衡，業於十日總務會議時，由南總裁分別指定，總務會長金光　夫，幹事長松利謙三，議員會長田中武雄，政務調查會長勝田永吉，衆議院部長田邊七六，組織部長窪井義道，實踐本部長松田竹千代。</p>
<h3>日安井中將入閣　任國務大臣　政務官廿四名全更迭</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日鈴木首相為充足國務大臣員額，以強化內閣陣容，謀與各方獲得緊密聯絡，曾請阿南陸相推選適當閣員。頃由陸相推　第二師團長預備陸軍中將安井藤治，首相乃於十一日下午三時，與安井中將懇談，結果已承諾入閣，五時半則於宮中舉行親任式，已由日情報局發表。</p>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日各政務官，隨小磯內閣總辭職同時提出辭呈，政府乃於十一日免去外務省政務次官松田等二十四名官職，然政府當局佐然保存政務官制度，至於人選與活動，今後加以改革，得大日本政治會之協助，而起用少壯人材。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>嚴禁投機活動</h3>
<p>上海市塲在表面上，固然保持着沈靜，但在裏面則由於投機商人的極端活動，而造成黃金和股票等的不斷繼續飛漲。如常此以往地放任下去，則各種物價必再隨之深高，且民生亦將日益瀕於危機。不僅在經濟上將激起嚴重的惡果，即在思想上政治上，亦將發生痛定思痛的癥結。所以我們特別迫切地希望當局，要大刀闊斧，根本料正這一流弊。</p>
<p>凡是對黃金和股票投機者，多半都在思想上或政治上，具有敵視軸心國者。他們不僅自作中間人，經常使資本流入抗戰區，而且在直接造成資本逃避的空氣。如儲鈔愈貶值，如上海經濟愈蕭條，如國府信用愈減低，則彼等的投機愈會成功。通貨安定，物價平抑，政府穩固，這與投機商人的利益是完全背道而馳的。投機商人在幸災樂禍地希望國府不利，日本危急，因而相信敵國優勢，這是勢所必至的道理。最低限度可以說，關於戰局不利的謠傳，都是他們在興風作浪。尤其值得注意者，即上海的不少黃金，全是由抗戰區流入的，另外還有數量不少的關金券等，都日益充斥於上海市區。這兩個事實就是敵方企圖用黃金和關金券來擾亂上海的金融，所以縱一時半刻也不應當加以放任。</p>
<p>嚴禁投機，和肅淸金融界之反國家態度，則採取鎭壓手段和金融施策的兩種措置，是絕對需要的。首先需要在警察方面嚴禁其行動，並監督金融機關，以堵塞投機資金的源泉。試觀過去的取締投機，在警察方面固然會實行斷然處置，但在金融方面的施策，却始終未能與之保持協調。因此，投機行為終未能抑制，然而這種不合理現象，現在必須立刻加以修正。當經濟警察開始活動時，則中儲的金融機關檢查處也應立刻開始活動，對於此種敵性投機份子決不應加以姑息。</p>
<p>有人說，縱令强制執行投機取締，而不建設生產，則物價亦不會跌落，或者有人說，如不硏究遊資對策，則投機行為是不可避免的。這兩種說法都有十分道理。然而反過來說，只要投機行為不停止，資金流入生產就不可能，因而遊資對策也就無效。所以我們與其兜上述的循環論圈子，莫如快刀斬亂麻地　　投機行動，欲使今日的物價通貨對策成功，則首先應當由取締投機始。</p>
<p>不希望本國的繁榮，不顧本國的勝利，只求自己的私利，這種投機份子是應當加以彈壓的。這不僅可導經濟界於正軌，而且在政治上和思想上具有重大意義。如藉口施策困難，而忽略這一重大問題，則決不能說是忠當於國家所課與的使命的。（譯自四月八日大陸新報社論）。</p>
<h3>解決游資問題的關鍵</h3>
<p>— 揚子江人</p>
<p>進資問題，現在業已達到最嚴重的階段了。今天本戰另欄業已指出，對於黃金·公債·股票等的敵性投機，已經成為使人趨之若驚的現象了。自從本月二日敵機飛來轟炸以還，曾經一度表現低落的股票，而又開始不斷製造飛漲的新記錄了。所可喜者，只米糧及其他主要物資仍保持着一向的平穩狀態，但我們決不因此而忽視最近上海金融界投機的趨勢。現在必須用冷靜的頭腦，正視極端瘋狂的投機市塲，以求打破目前漆黑一團糟的方法。</p>
<p>專尋民衆生活苦惱為開心的一部份窮凶極惡敵性份子，在眉飛色舞地進行着投機工作，這一點業已激起中國輿論怒　的非難和指摘。反對投機行為的言論，固然當發生這種囤積事件放米糧問題時，可以看到，然而現在仍然可以說是輿論痛快淋漓的衆矢之的。例如申報的社評「檢舉擾亂市塲的投機者」（三十一日），「投機與游資」（四月五日），「取締投機與誘導游資並進」等，新聞報的社評「三論金價問題」（四月三日），「物價問題的關鍵」（四月四日），「趕速消滅投機活動」（四月五日），「行動重於言辭」（四月六日）等，都集中視綫要求國府立刻大刀闊斧地取締黃金及證券等的投機。根據這種言論動向，也可以一目瞭然，問題極為嚴重。假如國府當局聲稱「沒法子」東手無策，便隨波逐流，敷衍了事，則在上海經濟背面大事活躍的敵性投機，定會日益走上尖銳化的階段。</p>
<p>為使善導充斥於投機範圍的游資，固然有好多方法，但其中最主要者，便是迅速斷然執行有計劃的農村貸款。過去從事農村貸款者，固然只有華興商業銀行及交通銀行，然而只　這兩個銀行來辦理，農村金融是無法周轉靈活的。必須迅速硏究密切地結合上海的民族資本和呻吟於金融困難的農民二者之辦法。我們要求這樣作，決不是虛無漂渺的抽象論者。例如上海需要米，農民則需一要錢。如上海民族資本只要肯表示誠意，則農村貸款是具有可能充分實現的客觀條件的。據最近在內地進行收買工作完畢返滬者的報告說，農民對於特別廉價的生活必需品，因為金融缺乏而不像以前那速歡天喜地來問津了。對於這樣的農民，才眞是需要供給游資的。一面取締一面綉導的金融對策，現在已經到達當局非迅速決定和實施不可的時期了。（譯自四月八日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>日精銳三面猛攻完全佔領老河口　同時在漢水方面作戰中</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　盟邦日本駐中國派遣軍報道部，四月十一日下午三時發表：　華北方面日軍部除，三月二十七日佔領渝美空軍前進基地老河口飛機塲，爾後搜索追擊渝第五戰區軍主力，四月八日，將老河口完全佔領。　華中方面日軍部隊，為呼應上項戰事，於漢水方面作戰中。</p>
<h3>老河口及冲繩　兩方面戰況　島田中佐對記者說明</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍報道部，十一日下午四時半在該部接見首都記者，由島田中佐說明老河口及冲繩島兩方面戰况，大意如次：</p>
<p>老河口戰況</p>
<p>華北方面日軍，於三月七日黎明，對老河口開始攻擊，至八日下午四時，將之完全佔領。按老河口為渝第五戰區軍司令部所在地·故於日軍開始攻擊時，漢水西側渝軍曾以二師兵力策動費時一日，即將老河口完全佔領。現老河口西方與北方之渝軍，正準備反攻巾，而日軍則正追擊第五戰區殘敗渝軍，期予以殲滅打擊。又華中方面日軍，亦與此相呼應，由荊門進攻，佔領襄陽，再沿漢水向老河口推進，對渝軍予以側擊。綜觀此次戰役，渝軍士氣異常沮喪，按老河口為渝空軍西北前進基地，由於老河口之失陷，　渝美空軍西北前進基地已告喪失，　予渝第五渝美空軍對平漢缐及長江下流之空襲將減少。以經濟上觀，老河口為鄂北一物資集散地，同時為交通樞紐，故老河口之佔領，對今後物資之收買及運輸上，將有甚大補益。</p>
<p>冲繩島戰況</p>
<p>沖繩島之戰役，已如日大本營所發表者，按敵軍登陸地點，為冲繩島中間之最狹地域，敵軍登陸後，即分其兵力為二支，一支北向，一支南向進攻。向南方進攻者，為敵陸軍之第七·二十四·九十六三師，向北進攻者，為敵海軍之第一·二·三三師。按冲繩島地區之戰事，過去以海面戰爭為主，陸地方面由地區之狹隘，故無大戰爭，由日大本營所發表，於陸戰中，日軍傷亡僅四百名，可知其戰爭之規模不大矣。但今後陸戰或將進入本格化，即敵軍之損失亦將增大。又日軍特攻隊仍在猛攻敵機動部隊中，敵軍基於硫黃島損失慘重之經騐，故於冲繩作戰，傾全力防禦日特攻隊之拚撞，而日軍仍將本著硫黃島戰役之精神與戰術，遂行「出血戰」，使敵重創。</p>
<h3>軍委會追悼榮子恒將軍</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　陸軍第十軍軍長榮子恒將軍，今春在山東泗水陣亡，軍事委員會當局以榮氏為國捐軀，特於十一日晟九時在國民大會堂舉行隆重追悼大會，陳兼委員長親臨主祭，軍委會總參謀長鮑文樾，陸軍部長蕭叔宣陪祭。國府各院部長官及各機關·部隊·學校等代表亦參加致祭，盟邦方面岡村總司令官高等顧問等出席參加，滿洲國大使館派代表致祭，十時正祭典於哀樂聲中禮成。</p>
<h3>西綫戰事重心　移里納河區　漢諾威柯丁根已失陷</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電由東西兩面向柏林進攻之反軸心軍猛烈推進，目下歐洲戰局日趨重大危急，西綫蒙高茂萊軍於抵達易北河時，東綫之蘇軍行將總攻柏林。德國中部戰事由威塞河移至里納河，美第九軍十日突入漢諾威市，於激烈巷戰後，將之完全佔領。反軸心軍於佔領柯丁根Gotingen後復向南擴張，似欲渡過里納河，由漢諾威經希爾得斯海姆　Hildesliein移至柯丁根地區。刻下不倫瑞克Brunswick及馬格德堡Magdeburg為反軸心軍進攻之目標，美軍機甲部隊抵漢堡至漢諾威間公路。</p>
<h3>沃特河畔　將發生大戰</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　海通社訊，近在本資勞·古班區有蘇生力軍集中·此外復有大批部隊移至法蘭克福以北之庫斯特林區，料蘇軍擬以兩翼向柏林之南北推進，而遂其包抄之目的。</p>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　德軍主力為防止柏林正面蘇軍之攻擊，刻集中於沃特河西岸，柯尼夫軍左翼及斯洛伐克西北進之愛利約蒙哥軍，協力企圖由慕尼黑方面與西線之美軍聯擊。沃特河之戰局益告緊迫。</p>
<h3>維也納市德軍撤退</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　據德軍前缐消息：德軍守備隊在維也納市中心展開熾烈巷戰，托布興麾下之蘇軍猛進，維也納德軍主力現已撤退，似將向九捷克領內移動。</p>
<h3>魯省獻機　一百七十架</h3>
<p>靑島十一日中央社電　靑島市及山東省甲日人士，為協助大東亞戰爭，特集金向日海軍當局獻納報國號飛機一百七十架，呈交靑島特別根據地司令部，該部當於八日上午十時，在山東路水交社舉行獻納飛機命名典禮。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論取締投機</h3>
<p>日前曾就取締投機與導引游資問題及工業出路問題略加申論。茲讀本月八日大陸新報社論「嚴禁投機活動」一文（見今日本版），除深表同感以外，意猶未盡，特再申論如次：</p>
<p>最近本市市塲金條、股票、統　、外幣等的瘋狂上漲，自為投機家浩動的結果；一種是積極和主動的投機，以製造政治經濟的謠言為手段，以「大魚吃小魚」的方式掠奪暴利為目標，因此，也柱往和政治性的投機不容易判別；另一種是消極的被動的投機者，此種人實際上占有最大多數，他們的手頭擁有相當資產，他們的目標就在這變幻莫測的時局之中，如何保持並增加他們所有資產的實際價値，因此，當囤積有利可圖時，他們把貨幣拋出，易取貨物；如金條股票有利時，他們又拋出囤貨而向金條股票等等方面活動。</p>
<p>但是，不問是怎樣的投機，當它形成一種浪潮而達到量高峯程度之時，則對於金融市塲之擾亂及社會經濟的危害，都是一樣的。投機者主觀上雖不一定有政治上的背景，但是在客觀上却會造成有利於敵方的結果，這是不能漠視的。前天報載小倉經濟顧問的談話中，說：一投機囤積的目標，是物價昂貴的重要原因。……倘自制投機囤積的氣氛，滲透於經濟界，漸而至於其他方面，就一定有很好的結果顯示出來了」。因此，今後的急務，還在如何取締和消滅投機囤積的氣氛。如果取締投機，消減投機的辦法，不能澈底執行，今天把投機浪潮趕到金條股票市塲去，明天把它們趕回日用必需品方面來，這樣經濟界的況疴祇有日陷於絕望，而什麽安定民生乃至物資戰力化協力盟邦等等都成了空口白話。</p>
<p>最近的投機浪潮，已經到了最高峯的程度，其擾亂金融市塲與危害社會經濟，為禍至烈。而足以誘導其他物價的上漲，威脅民生，危機更不可輕視。試舉兩例為證：　紙商王某因歷年投囤暴利，巳有數萬萬元以上資產，這次投機美亞綢廠股票，在八小時以內，虧蝕數萬萬元，傾蕩所有資產尙短數萬萬兀，交易所方面正在料理善後。　某某商業銀行中人，及紗廠業巨子，據說臨時組織投機集團多頭公司，資本五萬萬元，在這次浪潮中巳獲暴利八萬萬元。諸如此類的事例，失敗者固不足惜，而成功者必然是一家笑而萬家哭了。</p>
<p>所以，掀起浪潮的投機者，是一般市民之公敵，如不全力撲滅，則浪潮愈大，受禍愈烈。我們一方面希望當局以嚴刑峻法，偵查並懲治投機份子。一方面希望市民對於投機份子，負責盡量檢舉告發，當局對於告發人自當保守秘密。</p>

<h3>本市普通車輛　燈火管制取締規則</h3>
<p>關於本市自動車輛燈火管制暨音響管制取締規則，前經由第一警察局於去年七月三十一日第二十六號布告及同年八月二十三日市管察局第一號布告實施辦理。茲市警察局為普通車輛燈火管制之設備情形，實施取締起見，特再依據上海陸海軍防空司令部第二十七號布告之規定，另行規定本市普通車輛燈火管制取締規則，公布自即日起實施。茲錄該規則全文於后：</p>
<p>第一條　上海特別市地區內普通車輛之燈火管制取締事宜，除另訂者外，應依據本規則辦理之。</p>
<p>第二條　本規則所謂取締事宜，係指依據上海市燈火管制規則（民國三十一年七月二十七日公布）及上海陸海軍防空司令部布告第二十七號（民國三十三年十月十四日公布）內所規定之普通車輛燈火管制取緬規則及其處理手續而言。</p>

<h3>洞庭西山概况</h3>
<p>— 省一</p>
<p>洞庭西山為太湖中之一島嶼，離蘇州最近，故屬於吳縣管轄，因地處太湖之中，無兵　之危，向被人視為世外桃源，此次本市人口疏散委員會假定該山為疏散區域，實極適當。</p>
<p>西山雖名為「山」，實則平曠之處甚多，民屋均築於平地，而尤極多高堂大厦，類均建於淸乾嘉年間，惜近年地方莠民，昧於私利，有拆屋以售舊料者，然拆去不足十分之一，迄今保特完整者，仍佔絕對多數，山中街路，　道均以磚砌，相常整潔，小路則為泥地，雨天不免滑濘　。</p>
<p>治區</p>
<p>西山列為吳縣第十三區，設有區公所，現任區長王人傑，湖南人，係最近蒞任者。共分兩鎭八鄕，即束河，消夏兩　，匯里，鎭夏，鹿村，前灣，涵植，東園，梨棠，七賢八鄕是也。就中以東河鎭為最熱鬧，亦最安全，區公所曁昊縣警察局西山直轄分駐所均設於此，形成西山政治之中心。　之西越望崦嶺而至犬士門口，則有包山，實成兩煤礦公司，月產煤約千噸左右，蘇州電氣廠所需者，均仰給於此。</p>
<p>物產</p>
<p>西山週闡約九十里，現有人口三萬餕，有田八九八五畝，地二〇〇二七畝，山四二六一七畝，蕩三八七四畝，出產以水果為大宗，如枇杷·楊梅·石榴·橙·橘·桃·梅·栗·柿等是。次為絲繭，年約二千餘担，茶葉年約三百担，著名之「洞庭碧螺」，即係西山所產，餘如建築用之靑石，麻石，所產亦富，而山地荒蕪者，尤觸目皆是，若能加以投資懇植，則生產必極豐富也。</p>
<p>西山產米不多，豐稔之年，僅敷山民三月之需，餘都仰賴於外地，現時西山米糧之來源，均自宜興屬之和橋，方橋，周鐵橋，及吳縣屬之橫涇，浦莊等地阪來，每石售三萬七八千元，魚蝦等因係太湖土產，價亦尙廉，其餘油，鹽曁各種日用品，均遠較滬地為貴。</p>
<p>敎育</p>
<p>西山現有縣立小學二所，私立小學十餕所，在學兒童一千五百餘人，均係初級，並無完全小學，　論中學，敎育不甚發達，於此可見，深願社會熱心人士亟起興學。</p>
<p>名勝</p>
<p>西山名勝古蹟頗多，最著名者如石公山，消憂　等處，風景天然，極宜於療養靜修，如在此處創設病院，最為合宜，又西山寺廟菴觀等亦夥，可以容納一部份疏散之慈善團體。</p>
<p>交通</p>
<p>由滬至西山，必先至蘇州，蘇至山有輪船二艘，一名利興源，一名山北，按日輪班往來，停泊於胥門外洋橋堍永安弄柴茶館河埠，每最九時餘開，十二時抵本凟，乘客可上岸進午餐，一嘗石家飯店之美味，惟極侷促，下午一時由賣開山，約四時許抵西山，船泊七賢鄕之後堡，乘客即捨舟登陸，各自步行赴其目的地。由蘇至山除輪船外，尙有航船，煤船及石頭船，（即在蘇卸去煤，石後開回之空船）航船大致停泊在胥門外大日暉橋境金庭碼頭，煤船石頭船大致在電燈廠附近，惟有時因環境關係，僅至木凟為止，則必須旅客自行臨時樑詢矣。總之，本凟為西山船必經之地，旅客如在蘇搭小汽車或公共汽車赴本賣候西山船，則不愁無船可趁矣。（移酬義學）</p>

Furthermore, on the night of the 9th, a large force launched a surprise night raid, engaging in fierce battles throughout the night. By approximately 9:00 AM on the 10th, the enemy was completely driven out, and the high ground was recaptured. On the east coast, the enemy attacked Height 155 southwest of Tsuba with a strong force. The high ground was briefly captured by the enemy on the evening of the 9th, but Japanese forces stationed in the area launched a fierce counterattack, finally retaking it that night. On the other hand, in the Nago and Kin Nago areas, the enemy attempted to land on the evening of the 7th with 130 tanks and approximately 5,000 troops, but the stationed Japanese forces disabled 33 of their tanks. Also, on the morning of the 8th, the enemy landed one battalion of infantry on Tsuken Island, and it appeared that another battalion was added at noon.</p>
<h3>Nearly 300 Enemy Warships Sunk or Destroyed Around Okinawa; Aircraft Carrier Essex Has Been Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Enemy forces around Okinawa have not only landed on the island itself, but have also landed on Kerama Islands, Kamiyama Island, Mae Island, Tsuken Island, and others. A large number of troops are currently striving to reinforce and replenish their forces, but their warships have also repeatedly suffered heavy damage from fierce Japanese attacks. In the two weeks since the enemy's invasion of Okinawa, the Japanese side has sunk or destroyed 287 enemy warships, a great achievement. This is only the preliminary stage of the Japanese side's general offensive, and the enemy's losses will be even greater when the second and third phases are decided. The enemy's mobile force operations in the Pacific have been completely defeated around Okinawa. It is foreseeable that the Japanese Army and Navy will further exert their full strength to continue inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands, Somewhere on the Battlefield, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In the fierce attacks on the enemy's mobile forces between the 6th and 7th, subsequent investigations have revealed that the enemy ships sunk included three aircraft carriers: the escort carrier *Langley* converted from a cruiser, the standard carrier *Essex*, and the auxiliary carrier *Liscome Bay*.</p>
<p>[Mr. P, Military Authority, Discusses Reasons for Japan's Inevitable Victory</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a certain military authority: The final victory of this Greater East Asia War will undoubtedly belong to Japan. I make this determination for three reasons: Firstly, Japan has decided to adopt "bleeding tactics." Originally, serving in the military for one's country in modern warfare often does not require sacrificing one's life. The Anglo-American concept of military service is merely to use extremely precise aircraft or tanks to go to war, with the hope of a safe discharge in mind. In other words, Anglo-Americans can fight for their country, but they cannot sacrifice for their country. However, this time Japan is using "bleeding tactics" against Anglo-America, causing Anglo-America to bleed heavily everywhere. Anglo-Americans are not afraid of the loss of military equipment, but they are afraid of the sacrifice of blood and life. According to the US authorities' announcement, as of recently, more than one million people have been sacrificed, and the UK is also above this number. Therefore, in the past six months, the Anglo-American concept of war has been shaken, especially the soldiers, who feel panic towards the "bleeding tactics" they never expected. Secondly, Japan can defeat the many with the few. Although Anglo-America may be able to land 100,000 troops on Japanese soil, Japan will be able to use millions of troops domestically to invite and attack them. The war of the few against the many on various islands will inevitably find its opposite phenomenon on Japanese soil. If Anglo-America lands in China, it will inevitably suffer the same fate. We must not forget the strong forces of the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland, which number approximately several million, and various military supplies have already begun to be self-sufficient locally. Thirdly, Japan will definitely use long-term tactics to defeat Anglo-America. Japan has decided to adopt a long-term strategy since several years ago, and various military factories are located in Manchuria, the Chinese mainland, and the South Seas. The Japanese army will definitely be able to use this to counter Anglo-America's counterattack. The only things Anglo-America can use for a counterattack in East Asia are aircraft and warships, but these two items are not enough to make a final decision. The most important thing for victory is to attack the enemy country with a superior army, but this operation is extremely difficult for Anglo-America. After a long-term war, the Anglo-American people will inevitably feel war-weariness and will doubt the purpose of the war, and will eventually seek a peaceful way out.</p>
<h3>Japan to Convene Night Cabinet Meetings at Any Time</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Suzuki Cabinet, in view of the current state of the war, urgently needs to decide on major policies for accomplishing the decisive battle. It was decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 10th that in addition to regular cabinet meetings, night cabinet meetings and cabinet member discussions will be convened at any time. The reason for choosing the nighttime is that during the day, the ministers of each ministry are devoting their full efforts to carrying out administrative affairs, and they are relatively free only at night, so that they can take advantage of this quiet time to discuss the fundamental policies that the government should implement.</p>
<h3>Decision on Personnel for Executives of the Greater Japan Political Association</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The selection of personnel for the executives of the Greater Japan Political Association, which had been carefully considered by President Minami, was decided at the general affairs meeting on the 10th, with President Minami appointing each person separately. Chairman of the General Affairs Committee: Kanemitsu Fusao; Secretary-General: Matsuri Kenzo; Chairman of the Assembly of Members: Tanaka Takeo; Chairman of the Policy Research Committee: Katsuta Eikichi; Director of the House of Representatives Department: Tanabe Shichiroku; Director of the Organization Department: Kuboi Yoshimichi; Director of the Practice Headquarters: Matsuda Takechiyo.</p>
<h3>Japanese Lieutenant General Yasui Enters Cabinet, Appointed Minister of State; All 24 Parliamentary Vice-Ministers Replaced</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki, in order to fill the number of Ministers of State, strengthen the cabinet lineup, and seek close liaison with all parties, requested Minister of the Army Anami to recommend suitable cabinet members. Minister of the Army recommended Yasui Fujio, Reserve Army Lieutenant General and Commander of the Second Division. The Prime Minister held a cordial discussion with Lieutenant General Yasui on the afternoon of the 11th, and as a result, he agreed to enter the cabinet. At 5:30 PM, the appointment ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace, which has been announced by the Japanese Information Bureau.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese parliamentary vice-ministers all submitted their resignations at the same time as the resignation of the Koiso cabinet. The government dismissed twenty-four officials, including Matsuda, the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the 11th. However, the government authorities retain the parliamentary vice-minister system, and the selection of personnel and activities will be reformed in the future, with the assistance of the Greater Japan Political Association, and will appoint young talents.</p>

<h3>Strict Prohibition of Speculative Activities</h3>
<p>Although the Shanghai market maintains a calm appearance, inside, due to the extreme activities of speculators, gold and stocks continue to soar. If this is allowed to continue, the prices of various commodities will inevitably rise further, and the people's livelihood will be increasingly on the verge of crisis. Not only will serious adverse effects be stirred up economically, but painful problems will also occur ideologically and politically. Therefore, we particularly urgently hope that the authorities will fundamentally rectify this malpractice with decisive measures.</p>
<p>Those who speculate on gold and stocks mostly have a hostile attitude towards the Axis powers ideologically or politically. They not only act as intermediaries, constantly causing capital to flow into the anti-Japanese war zone, but also directly create an atmosphere of capital flight. The more the banknotes depreciate, the more depressed the Shanghai economy becomes, and the more the government's credibility decreases, the more successful their speculation will be. Currency stability, price stability, and government stability are completely contrary to the interests of speculators. Speculators are gloatingly hoping for the disadvantage of the national government and the crisis of Japan, thus believing in the advantage of the enemy country, which is inevitable. At the very least, it can be said that rumors about the unfavorable war situation are all being created by them. It is especially worth noting that a considerable amount of gold in Shanghai is flowing in from the anti-Japanese war zone, and a considerable amount of customs gold units are also increasingly flooding the Shanghai area. These two facts are the enemy's attempt to use gold and customs gold units to disrupt Shanghai's finances, so they should not be allowed to continue even for a moment.</p>
<p>Strictly prohibiting speculation and purging the anti-national attitude of the financial community require both suppressive measures and financial policies. First of all, the police need to strictly prohibit their actions and supervise financial institutions to block the source of speculative funds. Looking at past crackdowns on speculation, although the police have taken decisive actions, the financial policies have never been coordinated with them. Therefore, speculative behavior has never been suppressed, but this unreasonable phenomenon must be corrected immediately. When the economic police begin to operate, the financial institution inspection office of the Central Reserve Bank should also begin to operate immediately and should never condone such hostile speculative elements.</p>
<p>Some people say that even if the crackdown on speculation is enforced, prices will not fall without building up production. Or some people say that speculative behavior is inevitable if no measures are taken to address idle capital. Both of these statements are very reasonable. However, conversely, as long as speculative behavior does not stop, it will be impossible for funds to flow into production, and thus measures to address idle capital will also be ineffective. Therefore, instead of going around in the above-mentioned vicious circle, it is better to cut the Gordian knot and stop speculative activities. If we want today's price and currency countermeasures to succeed, we should first start by cracking down on speculation.</p>
<p>Those who do not hope for the prosperity of their own country, do not care about the victory of their own country, and only seek their own private interests, these speculative elements should be suppressed. This can not only guide the economic world to the right track but also has great significance politically and ideologically. If this major issue is neglected under the pretext of the difficulty of implementing policies, then it cannot be said that it is fulfilling the mission entrusted by the country. (Translated from the editorial of the Continental News on April 8).</p>
<h3>The Key to Solving the Problem of Idle Capital</h3>
<p>— Yangtze River Person</p>
<p>The problem of advancing capital has now reached the most serious stage. Today, this newspaper has already pointed out in another column that hostile speculation in gold, public bonds, stocks, etc. has become a frightening phenomenon. Since the enemy planes came to bomb on the 2nd of this month, stocks, which had once shown a decline, have begun to create new records of soaring prices. What is gratifying is that only rice and other major materials still maintain their usual stable state, but we must not ignore the recent trend of speculation in Shanghai's financial community because of this. Now we must use a calm mind to face the extremely crazy speculative market in order to break the current dark and chaotic situation.</p>
<p>A part of the most heinous and hostile elements who seek happiness in the suffering of the people are carrying out speculative work with relish, which has already aroused the anger of Chinese public opinion, condemnation, and accusations. The argument against speculative behavior can be seen when such hoarding incidents occur in the rice market, but now it can still be said that it is the target of public opinion's scathing criticism. For example, the editorials of *Shen Bao* "Report Speculators Disrupting the Market" (31st), "Speculation and Idle Capital" (April 5th), "Cracking Down on Speculation and Guiding Idle Capital Simultaneously" and the editorials of *Xinwen Bao* "Three Discussions on the Gold Price Problem" (April 3rd), "The Key to the Price Problem" (April 4th), "Expedite the Elimination of Speculative Activities" (April 5th), "Action is More Important Than Words" (April 6th), all focus on demanding that the national government immediately crack down on speculation in gold and securities with decisive measures. According to this trend of public opinion, it is also clear at a glance that the problem is extremely serious. If the national government authorities claim that "there is no way" and do nothing, then they will drift with the tide and deal with the matter perfunctorily, and the hostile speculation that is active behind the scenes in Shanghai's economy will definitely move towards an increasingly acute stage.</p>
<p>There are many ways to guide the idle capital that is flooding the speculative sphere, but the most important of them is to quickly and decisively implement planned rural loans. In the past, only Huaxing Commercial Bank and Jiaotong Bank were engaged in rural loans, but if only these two banks are handling it, rural finance cannot be flexible. We must quickly research a way to closely combine Shanghai's national capital with the farmers who are groaning in financial difficulty. We are not asking for this as a vague and abstract discussion. For example, Shanghai needs rice and farmers need money. If Shanghai's national capital is willing to show sincerity, then rural loans have objective conditions that can be fully realized. According to the report of those who recently returned to Shanghai after completing purchasing work in the interior, farmers are no longer eagerly asking about particularly cheap necessities as they used to, because of the lack of finance. It is precisely these farmers who need to be supplied with idle capital. A financial countermeasure of cracking down on one side and guiding on the other has now reached a time when the authorities must quickly decide and implement it.

<h3>Japanese Elite Forces Completely Occupy Laohekou with a Three-Pronged Attack; Simultaneously Fighting in the Hanshui Area</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The press department of the Allied Japanese Expeditionary Army in China announced at 3:00 PM on April 11th: Units of the Japanese Army in North China occupied the Laohekou airfield, a forward base for US Air Force bombing of Japan, on March 27th. After that, they searched for and pursued the main force of the Chongqing Fifth War Zone Army and completely occupied Laohekou on April 8th. To coordinate with the above-mentioned battle, units of the Japanese Army in Central China are fighting in the Hanshui area.</p>
<h3>Situation of Laohekou and Okinawa; Lieutenant Colonel Shimada Explains to Reporters</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Expeditionary Army in China held a meeting with reporters in the capital at its press department at 4:30 PM on the 11th. Lieutenant Colonel Shimada explained the situation of Laohekou and Okinawa Island as follows:</p>
<p>Situation of Laohekou</p>
<p>The Japanese Army in North China began attacking Laohekou at dawn on March 7th, and completely occupied it by 4:00 PM on the 8th. Laohekou was the location of the headquarters of the Chongqing Fifth War Zone Army. Therefore, when the Japanese Army began attacking, the Chongqing Army on the west side of the Hanshui River mobilized with two divisions to counterattack, but the Japanese Army occupied Laohekou completely in one day. Currently, the Chongqing Army west and north of Laohekou is preparing to counterattack, while the Japanese Army is pursuing the defeated Chongqing Army of the Fifth War Zone, aiming to annihilate and strike them. Furthermore, the Japanese Army in Central China is also coordinating with this, attacking from Jingmen, occupying Xiangyang, and then advancing along the Hanshui River towards Laohekou to flank the Chongqing Army. Overall, the morale of the Chongqing Army is extremely low in this campaign. Laohekou was a forward base for the Chongqing Air Force in the Northwest. Due to the loss of Laohekou, the Chongqing US Air Force's Northwest forward base has been lost, and the Chongqing Fifth War Zone and the US Air Force's air raids on the Pinghan Line and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River will be reduced. Economically, Laohekou is a distribution center for materials in northern Hubei and a transportation hub. Therefore, the occupation of Laohekou will greatly benefit the future purchase and transportation of materials.</p>
<p>Situation of Okinawa Island</p>
<p>The battle of Okinawa Island is as announced by the Japanese Headquarters. The enemy troops landed in the narrowest area in the middle of Okinawa Island. After landing, the enemy troops divided their forces into two branches, one heading north and one heading south to attack. Those attacking to the south were the enemy's 7th, 24th, and 96th divisions, and those attacking to the north were the enemy's 1st, 2nd, and 33rd Marine divisions. In the past, the fighting in the Okinawa Island area was mainly naval warfare. The land area is narrow, so there were no major battles. According to the Japanese Headquarters' announcement, the Japanese Army's casualties in land battles were only 400, which shows that the scale of the war is not large. However, future land battles may become full-scale, which means that the enemy's losses will also increase. Furthermore, the Japanese special attack units are still fiercely attacking the enemy's mobile forces. Based on their experience of heavy losses on Iwo Jima, the enemy is making every effort to defend against the Japanese special attack units' suicide attacks in the Okinawa operation. However, the Japanese Army will continue to carry out "bleeding warfare" based on the spirit and tactics of the Battle of Iwo Jima, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.</p>

<h3>Center of Western Front War Shifts to the Leine River Area; Hanover and Gottingen Have Fallen</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - As the anti-Axis forces advancing on Berlin from both the east and west intensify, the European war situation is becoming increasingly critical. While the Montgomery troops on the Western Front reached the Elbe River, the Soviet army on the Eastern Front is about to launch a general offensive on Berlin. The center of the German war effort has shifted from the Weser River to the Leine River. The US Ninth Army stormed into the city of Hanover on the 10th and completely occupied it after fierce street fighting. After occupying Gottingen, the anti-Axis forces expanded southward, apparently intending to cross the Leine River, shifting from Hanover via Hildesheim to the Gottingen area. Currently, Brunswick and Magdeburg are the targets of the anti-Axis forces' attack. US armored units reached the highway between Hamburg and Hanover.</p>
<h3>A Major Battle Will Occur on the Banks of the Warta River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports that a large number of Soviet reinforcements have concentrated near the Benzin-Guben area. In addition, a large number of troops have moved to the Kustrin area north of Frankfurt. It is expected that the Soviet army intends to advance north and south of Berlin with two wings in order to achieve its encirclement.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to German front-line news, the main German force is concentrating on the west bank of the Warta River to prevent the Soviet attack on the front of Berlin. The left wing of the Konev army and the Air-Yo Montego army advancing northwest of Slovakia are cooperating in an attempt to strike jointly with the US army on the western front from the Munich area. The battle on the Warta River is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>
<h3>German Troops Withdraw from Vienna</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to German front-line news: German garrison troops launched fierce street fighting in the center of Vienna.

<h3>Further Discussion on Suppressing Speculation</h3>
<p>Some time ago, I briefly discussed the issues of suppressing speculation, guiding idle capital, and the way out for industry. Now, after reading the editorial "Strictly Prohibit Speculative Activities" in the *Continental News* on the 8th of this month (see today's edition), in addition to expressing my deep agreement, I still have more to say, so I will elaborate further as follows:</p>
<p>The recent rampant rise in gold bars, stocks, government bonds, foreign currencies, and other commodities in the city market is the result of speculators' activities. One type is active and proactive speculation, using the creation of political and economic rumors as a means and plundering huge profits in a "big fish eats small fish" manner as the goal. Therefore, it is often not easy to distinguish between it and political speculation. The other type is passive speculation, which actually accounts for the vast majority. These people have considerable assets in their hands. Their goal is to maintain and increase the actual value of their assets in this volatile situation. Therefore, when hoarding is profitable, they throw out their currency and exchange it for goods. If gold bars and stocks are profitable, they throw out their hoarded goods and move to gold bars, stocks, etc.</p>
<p>However, no matter what kind of speculation it is, when it forms a wave and reaches its peak, it is the same in terms of disrupting the financial market and harming the social economy. Although speculators do not necessarily have a political background subjectively, they will create results that benefit the enemy objectively, which cannot be ignored. In the report the other day on the talks of economic consultant Ogura, he said: "Speculation and hoarding are important reasons for high prices... If the atmosphere of curbing speculation and hoarding permeates the economic world and gradually extends to other aspects, there will definitely be good results shown." Therefore, the urgent task for the future is still how to suppress and eliminate the atmosphere of speculation and hoarding. If the methods of suppressing speculation and reducing speculation cannot be thoroughly implemented, then today we will drive the speculative wave to the gold bar and stock market, and tomorrow we will drive them back to the daily necessities market. In this way, the economic malaise will only sink into despair, and things such as stabilizing people's livelihood, materializing combat power, and cooperating with the allies will all become empty talk.</p>
<p>The recent speculative wave has reached its peak. Its disruption of the financial market and harm to the social economy are extremely serious. It is also sufficient to induce the rise of other prices, threatening the people's livelihood, and the crisis should not be underestimated. Let me give two examples to illustrate: The paper merchant Wang has accumulated assets of more than tens of millions of yuan due to speculative profiteering over the years. This time, he speculated on shares of the American Asian Silk Factory, losing tens of millions of yuan within eight hours, and being short tens of millions of yuan even after liquidating all his assets. The exchange is currently handling the aftermath. Someone in a certain commercial bank and a giant in the yarn factory industry is said to have temporarily organized a speculative group, a bullish company, with a capital of 500 million yuan, and has already made a huge profit of 800 million yuan in this wave. In such cases, the losers are not to be pitied, but the winners will inevitably make one family laugh while ten thousand families cry.</p>
<p>Therefore, speculators who start waves are the public enemy of the general public. If they are not completely eliminated, the wave will be bigger and the suffering will be more severe. On the one hand, we hope that the authorities will use strict laws to investigate and punish speculators. On the other hand, we hope that the public will be responsible for reporting speculators as much as possible. The authorities should keep the identity of the informants confidential.</p>

<h3>The Police Bureau Actively Maintains Order at Train Stations</h3>
<p>In response to a request from the city's Population Evacuation Committee to take effective measures to maintain order and discipline at the wharves, the Municipal Government has instructed the Security Command and ordered the Police Bureau to comply. It is reported that the Police Bureau has instructed its sub-bureaus to implement this diligently, paying particular attention to illegal private sales of black market tickets and the extortion of porters, which should be closely monitored and strictly prohibited. Passenger inspection procedures should be simplified to facilitate evacuation. Upon receiving these orders, the sub-bureaus have investigated the organization and operations of automobile and steamboat transport companies within their jurisdictions, and have strengthened the management of boat and train ticket sales to ensure reasonableness and absolutely prohibit unauthorized price increases or black market sales, which will be investigated and dealt with. The Shanghai Railway Station and the Changning Road and Huangpu sub-bureaus have increased the number of officers stationed to maintain order at the railway stations and wharves.</p>

<h3>Overview of Dongting Xishan</h3>
<p>—Province One</p>
<p>Dongting Xishan is an island in Tai Lake, closest to Suzhou, and therefore under the jurisdiction of Wuxian County. Because it is located in the middle of Tai Lake and free from the dangers of war, it has always been regarded as a paradise. The fact that the Municipal Population Evacuation Committee has designated this mountain as an evacuation area is very appropriate.</p>
<p>Although Xishan is named "Mountain," it actually has many open spaces. The houses are all built on flat ground, and there are particularly many tall buildings, most of which were built during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty. Unfortunately, in recent years, local unscrupulous people, blinded by private interests, have demolished houses to sell old materials. However, the demolished houses account for less than one-tenth of the total, and the vast majority of those that remain intact are still the absolute majority. The streets in the mountain are all paved with bricks and are quite clean. The small roads are dirt roads, and they are inevitably slippery on rainy days.</p>
<p>Administrative Region</p>
<p>Xishan is listed as the thirteenth district of Wuxian County, with a district office. The current district head, Wang Renjie, is from Hunan and is the most recent appointee. It is divided into two towns and eight townships, namely Donghe and Xiaoxia towns, and Huili, Zhenxia, Lucun, Qianwan, Hanzhi, Dongyuan, Litang, and Qixian townships. Among them, Donghe Town is the most lively and the safest. The district office and the Xishan Directly Subordinate Outpost of the Wuxian County Police Bureau are located here, forming the political center of Xishan. West of the town, beyond Wangyan Ridge to the Quan Shimenkou, are the Baoshan and Shicheng coal mining companies, which produce about 1,000 tons of coal per month. The Suzhou Electric Plant relies entirely on this for its needs.</p>
<p>Products</p>
<p>Xishan has a circumference of about ninety li and a current population of 30,000. It has 8,985 mu of cultivated land, 20,027 mu of land, 42,617 mu of mountains, and 3,874 mu of marshland. The main products are fruits, such as loquats, waxberries, pomegranates, oranges, tangerines, peaches, plums, chestnuts, and persimmons. The next is silkworm cocoons, about 2,000 dan per year. Tea leaves amount to about 300 dan per year. The famous "Dongting Biluo" tea is produced in Xishan. Other abundant products include greenstone and bluestone for construction. However, the sight of barren mountain land is also striking. If investment and cultivation can be added, production will be very rich.</p>
<p>Xishan does not produce much rice. In years of good harvest, it is only enough to meet the needs of the mountain people for three months. The rest is relied upon from outside. The current sources of rice in Xishan are mainly from Heqiao, Fangqiao, Zhou Tieqiao, which belong to Yixing County, and Hengjing and Puzhuang, which belong to Wuxian County. Each stone is sold for 37,000 to 38,000 yuan. Fish and shrimp are cheap because they are local products of Tai Lake. Other items such as oil, salt, and various daily necessities are far more expensive than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Xishan currently has two county-run elementary schools and ten private elementary schools, with more than 1,500 children attending. They are all primary schools, and there are no complete elementary schools, not to mention middle schools. It can be seen that education is not very developed. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in the society will quickly start schools.</p>
<p>Places of Interest</p>
<p>Xishan has many famous scenic spots and historical sites. The most famous are Shigong Mountain and Xiaoyou Temple, with natural scenery that is very suitable for recuperation and meditation. It would be most appropriate to establish a hospital here. There are also many temples and monasteries in Xishan that can accommodate a part of evacuated charitable organizations.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>To get from Shanghai to Xishan, you must first go to Suzhou. There are two steamboats from Suzhou to the mountain, one named Lixingyuan and the other named Shanbei. They take turns on a daily basis, berthing at the Yong'an Lane Chai Tea House pier outside the Xumen Waiyang Bridge. They depart at about 9:00 AM and arrive at Bendu at 12:00 PM. Passengers can go ashore for lunch and taste the delicious food at the Shi Family Restaurant, but it is very crowded. The boat leaves Bendu at 1:00 PM and arrives at Xishan at about 4:00 PM. The boat docks at Houbao, Qixian Township, and passengers disembark and walk to their destinations. In addition to steamboats, there are also sailing boats, coal boats, and stone boats (i.e., empty boats that return after unloading coal and stone in Suzhou) from Suzhou to the mountain. Sailing boats generally dock at the Jinting Pier in the Dahui Bridge area outside Xumen, while coal boats and stone boats generally dock near the electric plant. However, sometimes due to environmental factors, they only go as far as Mudu, in which case travelers must inquire on their own. In short, Bendu is a must-pass stop for boats to Xishan. If travelers take a taxi or bus to Bendu in Suzhou and wait for a boat to Xishan, they will not have to worry about not being able to catch a boat. (Moved to Chou Yixue)</p>

<h3>Assistance for Poor Women in Childbirth Report Handled by This Office - Hui Sheng and Hui Lü Hospitals Enthusiastically Assist</h3>
<p>The Hui Sheng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital on Kang Nao Tuo Road in this city has always been extremely enthusiastic in serving the poor and sick. With this office's special agreement to handle free childbirth assistance, the hospital stipulates that for each parturient in March, the maximum stay is seven days. Including delivery fees and meals, only 3,000 yuan is charged. At a time when prices of goods and medicines are soaring, the hospital is covering a considerable deficit, benefiting poor parturients. Their enthusiasm is highly admirable. In March, a total of sixteen women were admitted for childbirth, and all had positive outcomes, totaling 48,000 yuan, which was directly paid by this office to the hospital, with no expenses for the parturients. The names of the parturients who received assistance are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yao He Yuying gave birth to a son. Cai Wangshi gave birth to a daughter. Liu Qianshi gave birth to a daughter. Zhang Zhoushi gave birth to a son. Yao Zhenli gave birth to a daughter. Wang Qianhua gave birth to a daughter. Chen Lu Shimei gave birth to a daughter. Chen Zhangshi gave birth to a son. Wang A'mei gave birth to a daughter. Liang Cailan gave birth to a son. Zhou Liu Lanying gave birth to a son. Li Wangshi gave birth to a son. Xu A'mei gave birth to a son. Ouyang Qiao gave birth to a daughter. Song Sunshi gave birth to a son. Wang Dexian gave birth to a daughter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Hui Lü Hospital, under special agreement, had three women admitted for childbirth in December of last year: Wu Caishi, who gave birth to a daughter; Huang Xiulan, who gave birth to a son; and Wang A'bao, who gave birth to a daughter, each costing 1,400 yuan for a total of 4,200 yuan. In January of this year, two women were admitted for childbirth: Qian Zhangshi, who gave birth to a daughter, and Shao Jinshi, who gave birth to a daughter, each costing 2,500 yuan for a total of 5,000 yuan. In February, nine women were admitted for childbirth: Shao Yinfeng, who gave birth to a son; Guo Yangshi, who gave birth to a daughter; Liang Wangqun, who gave birth to a son; Sheng Yulan, who gave birth to a daughter; Huang Ruizhen, who gave birth to a daughter; Xu Chenshi, who gave birth to a son; Zhu Hongshi, who gave birth to a son; Shao Youdi, who gave birth to a son; and Shen Cuishi, who gave birth to a son, each costing 2,500 yuan for a total of 22,500 yuan. The above all stayed in the hospital for seven days with meals provided, and all expenses were directly paid by this office to the hospital, with no expenses for the parturients. According to the report from Hui Lü Hospital, Wu Caishi had a difficult labor, and Dr. Huang Shuai, the director of obstetrics, performed surgery to deliver the baby with positive results. The hospital voluntarily covered the cost of anesthesia materials and other expenses of approximately 20,000 yuan, as well as procedure fees, hospitalization fees, and meal costs for over twenty days, without any additional charges. Their enthusiastic service is truly admirable, and we hereby express our gratitude.</p>
<p>If there are poor parturients who need assistance from this office and the specially contracted hospitals, please apply to this office. As long as they meet the conditions of being impoverished, the procedures are simple.</p>
