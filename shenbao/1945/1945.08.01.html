<p>社評</p>
<h3>復興節感言</h3>
<p>民國三十二年的今天，國民政府在盟邦援助之下，接收上海租界，而其他天津等地的租界，亦經先後收回。從此以後，租界二字，在中國全境，已變成歷史上的名詞，一向爲中國獨立自由最大障礙的租界，一向爲不平等條約中最大之根據的租界，不再存在，所以當局特定此日爲民族復興節，使全國國民，永遠不忘此國家最光榮的紀念日。在今年此日，我們紀念收回租界，含有更重要的時代意義。</p>
<p>一百年來，帝國主義者利用不平等條約爲護符，憑藉租界之一切特殊權利，以助長我國兵連禍結的內亂。由於租界的存在，中國軍隊不能通過；中國的法律不能保護及制裁本國人民；中國的民族工商實業無法發展，使國民經濟陷於買辦資本的畸形；且誘引中國各地遊資集中於租界，而加速我農村經濟之崩潰。</p>
<p>孫中山先生畢生革命奮鬥，對於廢除不平等條約，收回租界，列爲最重要及根本的革命任務。當其晚年，對此主張，尤爲堅決，憶民國十三年十一月二十八日在神戶對各團體歡迎宴會席上演說，尤拳拳於此種主張，而深盼日本應助中國廢除不平等條約，收回租界。中山先生說：「若是日本眞有誠意來和中國親善，便先要幫助中國，廢除不平等條約，爭回主人的地位，讓中國人得到自由身分，中國才可以同日本來親善。廢除不平等條約，脫離奴隸的地位，然後中國同日本，才可以再來做兄弟。」這幾句話，永遠銘刻在中日朝野有志人士的心嵌。在這次大東亞戰爭以後，整個東亞大局一變，國民政府雖在舉國陷於戰爭狀態，民衆惶惶不安之際，仍極力以求不平等條約之廢除；而盟邦政府，亦在集中力量於驅逐英美帝國主義勢力之時，不忘援助我國解除奴隸命運的初衷，終於兩年前的今天，助我收回租界，使中山先生畢生奮鬥未酬之志，一旦實現，中日兩大民族之間，更增進其互相瞭解，實可謂現在東亞民族史上最燦爛的一頁。</p>
<p>但是，我們今日慶祝收回租界之時，仍有不能不遺憾者，第一是大東亞戰爭已入最後的決戰階段，而我們對戰爭的協力，其自發自動性尚未能達到滿意的地步。第二，中日兩國多數見識遠大的領袖與志士，已知兩國之問決應密切携手，共同爲建造東亞人之東亞而奮鬥，但是重慶一部分人士，至今尚迷信英美帝國主義之「善意援助」，而繼續拖戰，以致在此嚴重關頭，中國境內，尙不免有兄弟自相殘殺之痛心事實。第三，重慶尚在高唱總反攻，放任英美帝國主義軍隊來華作戰，事之可慟寗有更逾於此者！因此，我們在此復興節紀念之際，不能不盼望全國民衆，以冷靜之理智，正視現實，爲我中華民族之澈底解放，爲建造東亞人之東亞，而與盟邦　作更進一步之協力，以期早日完成共同之使命，迎接全國全東亞復興慶祝之日！</p>

<h3>慶祝第二屆復興節官民合作衝破難關　周市長發表談話勉市民協力</h3>
<p>今日爲國定第二屆復興節，周市長特發表談話如次：</p>
<h3>具有劃時代的意義</h3>
<p>今天是中華民國第二屆復興節，也是收回上海租界的兩周年紀念。我們回溯過去，瞻念將來，一方面感覺興奮，一方面更覺得本身責任的重大。我國自從鴉片戰爭之役，訂立了許多不平等條約，五口通商，開闢租界，從此領土主權，支離破碎，造成種種畸形制度。過去上海因爲租界的存在，充滿享樂頹廢，浮華邪侈的風氣，完全成爲藏垢匿污的塲所。百年以來，民生貧困，經濟建設不能發展主要的原因，就是受了不平等條約的梏桎，政治不能完全步入正軌，亦未始不是受了租界的影響。國父孫先生看到中國衰，必定先求中國之自由平等，要求得到自由平等，非要先廢除不平等條約不可，這是國父畢生致力於革命的心願，也是革命同志全體努力所企求的</p>
<p>自從前年八月一日，承盟邦日本的特別協力，上海的法租界和公共租界得以次第收回，治外法權定議廢除，國民革命的宿願，才能得到部份的實現，領土重行完整，主權重行統一，所以中央規定今爲中華復興節，民族之解放，國家之獨立，政治之自主，都以此爲　始，實在具有劃時代的意義。</p>
<h3>上海市政完成統一</h3>
<p>租界收回之後，外交問題已經解決，此後是內政的問題了，百年來上海在英美的控制之下，一切中國固有的風俗習慣，都改變了原來的面目，根深蒂固，績重難返，治理上是特別感覺困難的上海，在陳前市長秉承汪故主席的意旨，壁劃經營之下，先將公共租界改爲第一區，法租界改爲第八區，以作統一市政的準備，因爲兩租界多年在外力的控制之下，一切制度習慣，都和市府本身不同，與其驟然合併，僅博得表面上的統一，不如逐步改善，實際上加强行政效率，循序漸進，一年期滿，然後合徘於市政府，一切推進，都很迅速圓滑，上海市政眞正達到空前統一的地步，這自然是陳前市長及各方的努力，盟邦的協助，市民的協力，才奠定了穩固的基礎。</p>
<h3>經濟治安全力以赴</h3>
<p>本年一月十五日，本人奉命到上海來承乏市政，明知環境困難，事業艱鉅，但爲了國家，爲了人民，只能竭盡所能來挑起這副重担，就職之初，本人在「吿上海民衆書」中披瀝決心，無論時局怎樣嚴重，環境怎樣艱難，我和我的幹部抱着埋頭苦幹的信心，不因循敷衍，不計毀舉，盡最大的努力，爲市民減少痛苦，謀取福利，首先裁汰冗員，縮小機稱，使得行政簡素化，以加强效率，一方面肅淸貪汚，侶導廉潔，種種的興革，我在二月十八日的市政諸詢委員會全體大會上，有很詳盡的報吿，半年以來，一切的改進頗多，達到預期的效果，雖然還未能一舉成功，使市民能够滿意，但市政當局決不推諉責任，天天在研討有效的對策，來解決一爭市政的問題。現在時局已經到了最嚴重的階段，敵機的空襲，正日益加緊，我們的工作，也愈加繁重，今後施政的重點，對於經濟和治安方面，當竭盡全力以赴，希望中外市民一體協力。</p>
<h3>步伐一致向前邁進</h3>
<p>收回租界是中國復興的起點，是建國過程的初步，可是國內和平統一，還未實現，而大東亞戰爭已進入決戰階段，市政的推進，國家的復興，全靠公務員的盡職，人民的努力，大家只有加緊振作，才能衝破當前的難關。時局愈是複雜嚴重，市民和政府之間，愈要緊密聯擊，政府要根據民意而施政，才能得到民眾的擁護，人民要能諒解當局的處境，國家政令才能順利推行，我們唯有步伐一致，向前邁進，完成興復中華，保衛東亞的偉業，才無負中央確定今天爲復興節的意義。</p>
<h3>滬市警察局最近警政設施　滿副局長復興節談話</h3>
<p>民國三十四年八月一日是上海市收回租界二週年紀念日，記者爲明瞭警局最近設施起見，特走訪滿副局長，就下列數點承發表談話如下；</p>
<h3>今後治安問題</h3>
<p>本市警政自租界收回以還，警政統一，治安日臻鞏固，一切建樹均有進展，惟際茲決戰階級，尤需確保治安，除與盟邦部隊緊急協力外，並對於所屬官醫力求素質健全，加緊學術訓練，以期負起所負使命，同時强化自警團員，使政府與人民打成一片，協同郎持治安。</p>
<h3>防犯工作方針</h3>
<p>防犯之要義在於防止犯罪，攸關於政治風俗至鉅，上海爲我國重要都市，環境特殊，流品複雜，致犯罪事件層出不窮，防犯工作，實爲重要之圖。本局當推行之先，即攝有防犯影片「回頭是岸」各地放映，除使各級民衆對防犯工作，有一進步之認識，而收協力推進之效，現犯罪行爲，已極度減少。</p>
<h3>防空救護對策</h3>
<p>最近敵機連日製滬，自目轟炸，罹難災民頗多，救護救濟工作實爲不容忽視當前急務，市府日前曾召集各局處長舉行臨時會議，討論空襲救護救濟對策，如獎勵救護人員奮勇搶救，取締醫院索價診療，增設救濟醫院，籌設災民收容所，運用全市醫務人員醫藥器材等辦法，復有本市各界聞人組織上海空襲救濟委員會，統籌辦理救護救濟所需之財力物力等事宜，今後救護救濟對策，在如何强化既決工作達到名實相符而已。</p>
<h3>肅正紀律問題</h3>
<p>兼局長周先生蒞任後，除頒發各項改進工作計劃，同時注意施行肅正警紀，提高待遇，現在官警工作頗獲各界好評。惟仍有少數人員秘密受賄，但一經查實，即予從嚴懲處，以示儆惕，現仍飭督察處繼續加强督察工作，以符警察消極工作不擾民，積極工作確保治安之本旨</p>
<h3>提高待遇問題</h3>
<p>周兼局長自蒞任後，首以整飭人事，肅正警紀，改善待遇，强化機構爲施政之的，尤以改善待遇一項，爲淸除積弊肅正警紀之唯一條件，礦在市座世分拮据當中，仍孳孳於謀取員警生活之安定，自三月份起，將薪俸提高四倍以上，幷每人按月免費配給食米二斗五升乃至六斗，股主以上人員分別等級發給機密費或辦公費，一而擴充警察福利社，特別强化採辦工作，盡量配給廉價日用物品，嗣鑒於物價猛晋，爰自七月份起復將薪俸數字予以提高，較六月份計增八倍有奇，一般員警生活咸吿安定。</p>

<h3>Burmese-Japanese Forces Cross the Xi Dan River, Capture Two Important Fortresses, Cutting Off the Enemy's Supply Artery</h3>
<p>Mandalay Frontline Base, 31st (Central News Agency) – The forces holding the area near Hlegu, Burma, have been containing the enemy for quite some time, and have been monitoring the two major supply arteries of the Rangoon-Prome highway, hindering the transportation of enemy military supplies. This time, they crossed the Xi Dan River and attacked, capturing the two fortresses of Louga Hill and Myitkyo, coordinating with the advancing western forces, preparing for a pincer attack. In order to strike a heavy blow against the enemy in the Xi Dan River basin, they have now begun to advance, cutting off enemy supply routes along the Burma Road south of Toungoo, causing heavy losses to the enemy. After the Japanese forces began their new movements, the enemy bombed the bridges most vital for transportation at a point fifteen kilometers north of Toungoo, creating a state of great chaos. In order to reverse the course of the battle, the enemy withdrew the heavily damaged 15th Division to the rear and redeployed the 7th Division to replace it, also dispatching air support for the operations. Furthermore, Japanese units in the area opposing enemy aircraft have switched to an offensive stance since the 16th, crossing the Ta Kyauk To River and are currently attacking important enemy strongholds.</p>
<h3>Balikpapan: Enemy Forces Make No Progress</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 31st (Central News Agency) – In the Balikpapan area, enemy forces attacked Japanese positions on the Samarinda Road from the western side on the morning of the 27th. The well-prepared Japanese units coordinated with newly deployed troops who had infiltrated ahead of the enemy on the 26th, launching a pincer attack, inflicting approximately fifty casualties on the enemy and repelling them. On the 28th, the enemy continued to attack Japanese positions but were also repelled. In addition, a small group of enemy forces attacked in the Dambaton area on the 26th, but were driven back by a Japanese counterattack. Enemy aircraft activity has increased in the Elermita area, but the Japanese suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Bougainville Island: Japanese Forces Annihilate the Enemy</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 31st (Central News Agency) – Japanese units in the Miwo River area of southern Bougainville Island occupied the left bank of the Miwo River in early July and continued to attack the enemy fiercely, cutting off their supply lines. As a result, the enemy gathered its remaining forces and worked to strengthen its defenses, relying solely on aerial resupply to continue its passive resistance. The Japanese forces' achievements in that area in mid-July included inflicting 252 casualties on the enemy, destroying two trucks and twenty armored vehicles.</p>
<h3>National Japanese Ship Personnel Form Volunteer Combat Corps</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – To complete the decisive battle's transport efforts, the Japanese government, on August 1st, ordered the formation of "Ship Volunteer Combat Corps" by the crew members of national ships, under the order of the Minister of the Navy, which was announced and implemented by the Ministry of the Navy at 3:00 PM on the 31st.</p>
<h3>Shimizu Port Subjected to Naval Gunfire; Many Carrier-Based Aircraft Shot Down During Attacks on Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – At around midnight on the 31st, several enemy vessels, seemingly part of an enemy task force, shelled Shimizu Port.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – At around 9:30 PM on the 30th, ten enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the airfield base in the southern area of Miura Peninsula, Boso Peninsula.

Also, between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM on the same morning, eight hundred enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Kanto area, two hundred each attacked the Tokai area and the Kanshin area, and two hundred and several tens attacked the Maizuru area.

The enemy task force appears to be based on fourteen vessels, including specially equipped aircraft carriers, and on the 31st it seemed to be cruising in the sea south of the Kii Peninsula.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – An estimated total of 700 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Kanto area in several waves on the morning of the 30th, carrying out indiscriminate bombing of airfield military facilities, transportation infrastructure, ships in the harbor, and schools and hospitals. Japanese damages were extremely minor. At the same time, approximately 350 enemy aircraft from enemy carrier based aircraft and southern bases attacked the nearby area in several waves, strafing airfields and transportation infrastructure with machine guns. Japanese damage was very minor. By 4:00 PM, Japanese forces had confirmed shooting down fourteen enemy aircraft. Also, on the night of the 29th, enemy carrier-based aircraft conducted naval gunfire strikes on the coast near Hamamatsu. Japanese damage was very minor.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reflections on Restoration Day</h3>
<p>Today, in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the National Government, with the assistance of allied nations, took over the Shanghai Concessions, and the concessions in other places such as Tianjin have also been recovered one after another. From now on, the term "concession" has become a historical term throughout China. The concessions, which have always been the biggest obstacle to China's independence and freedom, and which have always been the biggest basis of unequal treaties, no longer exist. Therefore, the authorities have designated this day as National Restoration Day, so that the people of the whole country will never forget this most glorious memorial day for the nation. In this year's celebration of this day, commemorating the recovery of the concessions has an even more important significance.</p>
<p>For a hundred years, imperialists have used unequal treaties as amulets, relying on all the special rights of the concessions to fuel the internal strife in our country. Due to the existence of the concessions, Chinese troops could not pass through; Chinese law could not protect and punish its own people; China's national industry and commerce could not develop, causing the national economy to fall into the distorted form of comprador capital; and inducing capital from all parts of China to concentrate in the concessions, accelerating the collapse of our rural economy.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to revolutionary struggle, listing the abolition of unequal treaties and the recovery of concessions as the most important and fundamental revolutionary tasks. In his later years, his position on this issue was even more resolute. In his speech at the welcome banquet held by various organizations in Kobe on November 28th of the 13th year of the Republic of China, he sincerely expressed his hope that Japan would help China abolish unequal treaties and recover the concessions. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "If Japan is truly sincere in being friendly with China, it must first help China abolish unequal treaties, regain its position as master, and allow the Chinese people to obtain their freedom. Only then can China be friendly with Japan. After abolishing unequal treaties and escaping the status of slavery, China and Japan can then be brothers again." These words are forever etched in the hearts of concerned people in both China and Japan. After this Greater East Asia War, the entire situation in East Asia changed dramatically. Although the National Government was in a state of war and the people were uneasy, it still tried its best to abolish unequal treaties. And the Allied governments, while focusing on expelling the forces of British and American imperialism, did not forget their original intention to help our country lift its slave destiny. Finally, two years ago today, they helped us recover the concessions, realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong unfulfilled ambition. This further enhanced the mutual understanding between the two major nations of China and Japan and can be said to be the most brilliant page in the history of East Asian nations.</p>
<p>However, when we celebrate the recovery of the concessions today, there are still some things we cannot help but regret. First, the Greater East Asia War has entered its final decisive stage, and our cooperation in the war has not yet reached a satisfactory level of spontaneity. Second, most leaders and patriots in China and Japan with far-sighted vision know that the two countries should join hands closely and strive together to build an East Asia for East Asians. However, some people in Chongqing still cling to the "benevolent assistance" of British and American imperialism and continue to drag out the war, resulting in the painful reality of brothers killing each other in China at this critical juncture. Third, Chongqing is still singing the praises of a general counter-offensive, allowing British and American imperialist troops to come to China to fight. What could be more heartbreaking than this! Therefore, on this Restoration Day, we cannot help but hope that the people of the whole country will face reality with calm reason, and for the sake of the thorough liberation of our Chinese nation and for the sake of building an East Asia for East Asians, we will work with the allied nations for further cooperation, so as to complete our common mission as soon as possible and usher in the day of celebrating the restoration of the whole country and the whole of East Asia!</p>
<h3>President of the Control Yuan, Gu Zhongshen, Passes Away from Illness</h3>
<p>Wuxi, 31st (Central News Agency) – Gu Zhongshen, a native of this city and President of the National Government Control Yuan, passed away at the age of sixty-six. In his early years, he followed the Father of the Nation and devoted himself to the revolution. After the National Government moved its capital, he served as President of the Control Yuan as a revolutionary elder, and made many contributions to clarifying official corruption. However, due to his advanced age, his old illnesses recurred from time to time. After the news of the death of former Chairman Wang was confirmed last year, President Gu was saddened by the passing of an old friend, and his illness worsened. He originally resided at No. 133 Shanghai Road, Nanjing, but returned to Wuxi for recuperation on June 29th of this year. He went to Hengshan Villa near Meiyuan for recuperation for a period of time. After being diagnosed and treated by famous doctors from this city, he ultimately succumbed to old age and weakness, and medical treatment proved ineffective. He then moved to the city, and at around 10:00 AM on the 31st of this month, he finally fell into an incurable state. He instructed the county authorities to urgently request Governor Su of Jiangsu Province to come to Wuxi to meet with him and make a will. However, it was too late, and at 11:50 AM on the morning of this day, this national founding father passed away. It is reported that Gu's remains are scheduled to be placed in a coffin on August 2nd.</p>

The Soviet military authorities are continuing to search for clues about Hitler's life or death, but it can now be asserted that if Hitler is still alive, he is definitely not within the Soviet-occupied zone. As for other rumors from the Nazi side claiming that Hitler is still alive, they are merely intended to create a legend to encourage the Nazi elements active in the interim to intensify their work.</p>

The Order of the Garter is the highest honor of knighthood in England. However, Churchill has declined the honor from the King, stating that under the current circumstances, he is unwilling to accept this favor.

<p>Bern, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to news from Paris, General de Gaulle's proposal regarding the organization of the new French charter was overturned on Saturday night by a vote of 19 to 210. Currently, all matters relating to the organization of the charter are in great confusion. As for what second measures de Gaulle's government might take, no one knows at present. Parliament will reconvene tomorrow afternoon, simply to exchange views on the organization of the charter. General de Gaulle stated during the parliamentary debate, "If those who have supported me until now oppose me on this crucial point and want to abandon me, I would rather resign. However, I must state that I have no intention of threatening the government with my resignation, and I hope that you can truly judge based on the merits and demerits to the nation." No one knows whether General de Gaulle's intention in saying this was to indicate that he would resign immediately if Parliament insisted on its current attitude. Since the French Parliament began its debate last Friday, General de Gaulle has been criticized from all sides, accusing him of harboring ambitions to monopolize national power.</p>

<p>Madrid, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to news from Paris, French authorities are dispatching thirty teams of police officers to arrest former Vichy leader Laval as soon as he arrives in France by plane from Barcelona and to detain him strictly. According to Reuters, Laval recently went to an airfield near Barcelona, intending to travel by plane to an "unknown location," but the French police officers responsible for arresting Laval are also unaware of where to await his arrival. French foreign authorities are extremely secretive about the exact location and time of Laval's arrival in France. Laval's return to France will be accompanied by his wife and several key members of the former Vichy government. It is said that French authorities have been in discussions with the Spanish government for more than a month regarding the extradition of Laval.

<h3>Celebrating the Second Renaissance Day, Government and People Cooperate to Overcome Difficulties - Mayor Zhou Delivers a Speech Encouraging Citizens to Cooperate</h3>
<p>Today is the second national Renaissance Day. Mayor Zhou delivered a special speech as follows:</p>
<h3>Possesses Epoch-Making Significance</h3>
<p>Today is the second Renaissance Day of the Republic of China, and also the second anniversary of the recovery of the Shanghai concessions. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we feel excited on the one hand, and on the other hand, we feel the importance of our own responsibilities even more. Since the Opium War, our country has signed many unequal treaties, opening five ports for trade and establishing concessions, which has fragmented territorial sovereignty and created various abnormal systems. In the past, Shanghai, due to the existence of the concessions, was full of an atmosphere of enjoyment, decadence, extravagance, and evil, and completely became a breeding ground for filth and dirt. For a hundred years, the main reason for the poverty of the people's livelihood and the inability to develop economic construction was the shackles of unequal treaties. The failure of politics to fully enter the right track was also influenced by the concessions. Dr. Sun Yat-sen saw the decline of China and believed that it was necessary to first seek freedom and equality for China. To obtain freedom and equality, it was necessary to first abolish the unequal treaties. This was the lifelong aspiration of the Founding Father dedicated to the revolution, and it was also what all revolutionary comrades strived to achieve.</p>
<p>Since August 1st two years ago, with the special cooperation of our ally Japan, the French Concession and the International Settlement of Shanghai were gradually recovered, and extraterritoriality was abolished. The long-cherished wish of the national revolution was partially realized, the territory was once again complete, and sovereignty was once again unified. Therefore, the central government stipulated today as the Chinese Renaissance Day. The liberation of the nation, the independence of the country, and the autonomy of politics all began with this, and it is indeed of epoch-making significance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Administration Completes Unification</h3>
<p>After the recovery of the concessions, the diplomatic issues have been resolved, and what follows are domestic political issues. For a hundred years, under the control of Britain and the United States, all the inherent customs and habits of China have changed their original appearance, deeply rooted and difficult to reverse. Governance is particularly difficult. Shanghai, under the management of former Mayor Chen, following the intentions of the late Chairman Wang, first changed the International Settlement into the First District and the French Concession into the Eighth District, in preparation for the unification of the municipal administration. Because the two concessions had been under the control of foreign forces for many years, all systems and habits were different from the city government itself. Instead of abruptly merging them, only gaining superficial unity, it was better to gradually improve and strengthen administrative efficiency in practice, proceeding step by step. After a year, they were merged into the municipal government. All advancements were rapid and smooth. The Shanghai municipal administration truly reached an unprecedented level of unity. This is naturally due to the efforts of former Mayor Chen and all parties, the assistance of our allies, and the cooperation of the citizens, which laid a solid foundation.</p>
<h3>Economic and Security Efforts to the Utmost</h3>
<p>On January 15th of this year, I was ordered to come to Shanghai to take over the municipal administration, knowing that the environment was difficult and the task was arduous. But for the sake of the country and the people, I can only do my best to shoulder this heavy burden. At the beginning of my term, I expressed my determination in the "Proclamation to the People of Shanghai," no matter how severe the situation or how difficult the environment, I and my cadres will work hard with confidence, without being perfunctory or concerned about praise or criticism, and make our greatest efforts to reduce the suffering of the citizens and seek their welfare. First, we will eliminate redundant personnel and downsize the organization to simplify administration and strengthen efficiency. On the one hand, we will eradicate corruption and promote integrity. I gave a very detailed report on various reforms at the plenary meeting of the Municipal Advisory Committee on February 18th. In the past six months, many improvements have been made, reaching the expected results. Although we have not been able to succeed in one fell swoop and satisfy the citizens, the municipal authorities will never shirk their responsibilities and are constantly studying effective countermeasures to solve the problems of municipal administration. Now the situation has reached its most serious stage, and enemy air raids are intensifying day by day. Our work is also becoming more and more heavy. In the future, the focus of our administration will be on economic and security aspects, and we will do our utmost. We hope that Chinese and foreign citizens will cooperate as one.</p>
<h3>March Forward in Unity</h3>
<p>The recovery of the concessions is the starting point of China's renaissance and the first step in the process of nation-building. However, domestic peace and unification have not yet been realized, and the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage. The advancement of municipal administration and the renaissance of the country depend on the dedication of civil servants and the efforts of the people. Everyone must step up their efforts to overcome the current difficulties. The more complex and severe the situation, the closer the connection between the citizens and the government. The government must govern according to public opinion in order to gain the support of the people. The people must be able to understand the situation of the authorities so that national policies can be smoothly implemented. We must only march forward in unity, complete the great cause of reviving China and defending East Asia, so that we will not fail the meaning of the central government's determination to make today Renaissance Day.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Police Department's Recent Police Facilities - Deputy Director Man's Talk on Renaissance Day</h3>
<p>August 1st, 1945, is the second anniversary of the recovery of the concessions in Shanghai. To understand the police department's recent facilities, the reporter specially visited Deputy Director Man, who gave a talk on the following points:</p>
<h3>Future Security Issues</h3>
<p>Since the recovery of the concessions, the city's police administration has been unified, and security has been increasingly consolidated. All constructions have made progress. However, at this decisive stage, it is even more necessary to ensure security. In addition to emergency cooperation with allied troops, we also strive to improve the quality of our medical officers and intensify academic training in order to fulfill our responsibilities. At the same time, we will strengthen the members of the self-defense corps so that the government and the people can work together and jointly maintain security.</p>
<h3>Crime Prevention Policy</h3>
<p>The main point of crime prevention lies in preventing crime, which is crucial to politics and customs. Shanghai is an important city in our country with a special environment and complex people, resulting in endless criminal incidents. Crime prevention work is a very important task. When the bureau promoted it, it made a crime prevention film "Turning Back is the Shore" to be shown in various places. In addition to making people at all levels have a progressive understanding of crime prevention work, it also achieved the effect of cooperative promotion. Now criminal behavior has been greatly reduced.</p>
<h3>Air Raid Protection and Rescue Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Recently, enemy planes have been bombing Shanghai for days, and there have been many victims. Rescue and relief work is an urgent task that cannot be ignored. The municipal government recently convened a temporary meeting of bureau chiefs to discuss air raid rescue and relief countermeasures, such as rewarding rescue workers for their courageous rescue, cracking down on hospitals charging high prices for medical treatment, increasing the number of rescue hospitals, planning for disaster relief shelters, and using the city's medical personnel and medical equipment. In addition, people from all walks of life in the city organized the Shanghai Air Raid Relief Committee to coordinate the financial and material resources needed for rescue and relief. In the future, the rescue and relief countermeasures will focus on how to strengthen the existing work to achieve consistency between name and reality.</p>
<h3>Discipline and Discipline Issues</h3>
<p>Since Director Zhou took office, in addition to issuing various improvement work plans, he has also paid attention to implementing discipline and discipline, and improving treatment. Now the work of officers and police has been well received by all sectors of society. However, there are still a few people who secretly accept bribes, but once they are found out, they will be severely punished to show a warning. Now we are still ordering the supervisory office to continue to strengthen the supervision work, so as to conform to the police's passive work of not disturbing the people and the active work of ensuring security.</p>
<h3>Treatment Improvement Issues</h3>
<p>Since Director Zhou took office, he has focused on reforming personnel, disciplining the police, improving treatment, and strengthening the institution as the goal of his administration. In particular, improving treatment is the only condition for eliminating abuses and disciplining the police. Although the city's finances are tight, he is still working hard to seek the stability of the lives of police officers. Since March, he has increased salaries by more than four times, and each person is given 2.5 to 6 dou of rice per month for free. Officers above the level of shareholder are given confidential expenses or office expenses according to their rank. At the same time, he expanded the police welfare society and strengthened the procurement work as much as possible to distribute cheap daily necessities. Later, in view of the sharp increase in prices, he increased the salary again from July, which was more than eight times higher than in June, and the lives of ordinary police officers were stable.</p>

<h3>Air Raid Relief Association Subsidizes Injured Patients; Disbursements Begin Immediately Through Medical Team</h3>
<p>Following repeated air raids on the city, injured refugees are seeking treatment at various hospitals, facing extreme financial difficulties. The Medical Team of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association's Air Raid Relief Association, after its first meeting, immediately dispatched personnel to various hospitals to investigate the actual conditions of relief efforts. As of July 28th, it is reported that the total number of hospitalized injured patients in various hospitals is approximately 300. To ensure that donations reach the injured promptly and to assist hospitals, the Medical Team will provide a daily cash subsidy from the Welfare Association for each hospitalized air raid victim. Those who have undergone surgery will receive 50,000 yuan, while others will receive 20,000 yuan, starting from the day of admission. However, this subsidy does not apply to patients in first or second-class wards. Furthermore, the association will not provide subsidies to those who receive subsidies from other sources or who voluntarily decline assistance. These subsidies will be distributed by the Medical Team immediately, and detailed procedures are being finalized. The method of subsidizing injured outpatients is also being determined in the detailed procedures. Hospitals are requested to apply to the Medical Team immediately after receiving injured patients. If Medical Team personnel visit the hospital for investigation, they should be provided with necessary facilitation.</p>
<h3>Money Shop Increases Interbank Lending Amount</h3>
<p>The United Reserve of the city's money shop industry has been handling interbank lending operations for its major member money shops to timely address the urgent needs of the industry. The amount per shop has always been very low. Subsequently, due to the actual needs of the industry, it has been repeatedly increased, from one million to two million yuan, and then to three million yuan per shop. However, with the current increase in demand and the vast scale of business operations, the interbank lending limit in the district seems too small. Therefore, the Money Shop Association recently requested all member money shops to increase the amount to protect the smooth operation of the industry and meet current needs. The Money Shop has already followed the association's notification and passed the decision through the Board of Directors and Supervisors. Starting from August 1st of this year, the lending limit per shop will be increased to ten million yuan. The increase will be strictly controlled, and the basic amount will still be three million yuan per shop.</p>

<h3>Mr. Chen Gongbo Donates Book Proceeds to Support Education, Named "Cold Wind Collection Team"</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Gongbo has been extremely enthusiastic about donating to this newspaper's scholarship fund in the past. He has generously donated the proceeds from the sale of his new book, "Cold Wind Collection," totaling 10 million yuan, to establish the "Cold Wind Collection Team" honorary team. Mr. Chen previously established a scholarship to support university and vocational students, with remarkable results. This time, he has again generously donated a large sum to benefit impoverished students and cultivate talent for the country, which is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Compensation for Losses Donated to Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>A letter from Ti Yanliao Raw Material Store states: "We are writing to inform you that on March 26th of last year, our store purchased one load of Non-Fading BB Ocean Blue dye from Yongda Yanliao Store's Jiang Yongguang. Later, it was discovered that the weight was short by eight pounds. After notifying Mr. Jiang, he verified and acknowledged the shortage and agreed to compensate. However, the matter was delayed until now, more than four months later. After mediation, he finally compensated our store 196,000 yuan at the original purchase price. However, at the current market price, each pound is worth nearly one million yuan, resulting in a significant loss for our store. We are donating this amount to the scholarship fund to contribute our meager efforts. Please publish the original letter in the newspaper."</p>
<h3>Inspired to Support Education After Reading Fundraising Appeals</h3>
<p>A letter from Wei Lidui, a clerk in the dye industry, states: "Every time I read the articles in your newspaper advocating for various industries to support education, I am deeply moved. However, I am just a small clerk in the dye industry. With the savings from my usual frugality, I am making an effort to donate 100,000 yuan. If this can inspire the big bosses in our industry, those with significant positions and abundant resources, to rise up and generously donate to support education, it would be like a novice showing off before experts. I dare to say that I am casting a brick to attract jade, and I am willing to be a cheerleader for your newspaper."</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Consumer Cooperative to Distribute Cloth Starting Today</h3>
<h3>Municipal Government Consumer Cooperative to Distribute Cloth Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Employees' Consumer Supply Cooperative will begin distributing cloth from today until August 10th. There are five types of cloth: wool flannel, shilin cloth, printed cloth, white cloth, and unbleached cloth. Each type is divided into three grades: A, B, and C. The length varies due to different sources. After processing, the length ranges from five feet to fourteen feet. There are various types of clothing materials. The cooperative will be responsible for distribution, allocating the length and types of clothing materials according to the number of employees in each government agency. The distribution table and application notification have already been sent to each agency, which will distribute them internally. Each employee can then take the notification, along with the distribution certificate issued by the cooperative, to the cooperative to purchase the cloth at a price that is approximately 30% to 40% lower than the market price. It is also reported that Japanese employees will receive the same benefits.</p>

<h3>Mr. Yang Changkang's Birthday Celebrations Once Again Transferred to Charitable Deeds</h3>

I tried to decline, but was unsuccessful. Therefore, I am once again transferring the above birthday gifts to charity to benefit my friends and relatives. The distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>2 million yuan to your newspaper's scholarship fund honorary team, 1.2 million yuan to the ordinary team, 1 million yuan each to the Good Shepherd Society, the Huang Wanzi Society, and the Xujiahui Sacred Heart Mother's Orphanage, 500,000 yuan each to Hui Sheng Obstetrics Hospital and Hui Lu Obstetrics Hospital, 250,000 yuan to the air raid relief fund, and 200,000 yuan each to your office's poverty relief fund, small school medical aid fund, small loan fund, midwife fund, and medical aid fund.
