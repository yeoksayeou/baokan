<p>神風及特攻隊猛烈拼撞</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日潛水部隊對游弋於冲繩海域之機動部隊及艦船集團，力加猛襲，予敵以極大損害，本月七日復於硫黃列島海面發現敵空母集團，當即加以準確射擊，擊沉其特設空母一艘。關於沖繩海域日潛水部隊活躍情形，依據大本營發表或來自當地之電報，已可見其一斑，該潛水部隊業巳擊沉包括特設空母一艘之敵艦船計達十艘，在沖繩戰局行將突入補給戰階段之際，日軍對敵方運輸陸軍兵力之企圖予以大打擊。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日航空部隊十一日上午於琉球東方海面攻擊敵艦船，上午八時轟沉艦型不詳者一艘，八時五十分擊沉艦型不詳者一艘，他方特別攻擊隊亦於是日晨對沖繩東方海面之敵空母加以攻擊，擊傷正規空母一艘。又十日晚至十一日未明，日航空部隊攻擊沖繩本島北部機場，使其四處起火，予以莫大損害。</p>

<p>西南太平洋基地十二日中央社電　美軍在沖繩方面之航空兵力，因遭日方連續對艦船及機塲之猛攻，迭次減少，尤値注目者，即艦載機因空母之喪失而驟減，陸上機占出擊總數三分之二，敵陸上使用之主要機場北中兩機塲，遭日軍連襲，不克如意使用。伊江島之機塲現仍在整備中，航空戰上，日方漸處於有利之地位，敵方在本島作戰之陸上機以小型機爲主，約有七八十架，伊江島方面集中艦船約七十艘，刻正努力整備機塲及補給工作中。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據關島來電稱，尼米資司令部十二日發表戰况公報如下：自十日夜間至十一日晨，日軍航空部隊數編隊，對沖繩附近美太平洋艦隊再加攻擊，但對以上攻擊美艦艇所受之損害，則保守沉默。按以上公報幷載有日軍陸上作戰之奮鬥情形稱：日軍發動其熾烈之攻擊及無數次之陸上反攻，十日夜之戰事通　達且，繼續不停。</p>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電　據渝方轉播關島十一日電稱，美太平洋艦隊軍艦及艦上機，海軍陸戰隊飛機等，於九日攻擊琉球島南部之日方設施，同日晚，日機數事襲擊大琉球海面之美方船隻，擊損美輔助艦兩艘，日機復炸機塲。十日晨日機兩度襲擊美方船團及地方設施，美海軍陸戰隊第六師，十日於大琉球島一部架橋渡河，十一日晨架設橋樑時，因日軍肉彈抵抗，頗受損失，進行受阻，現日美軍正於大琉球島南部陣地數處展開肉搏戰。</p>

<p>東京十二日中央社電　朝日新聞社沖繩支局宗貞利登特派員，爲報道沖繩本島附近血戰情况，乃毅然留居沖繩本島，與陸海將兵共嘗辛苦，其從軍第一次報道之要旨如次：敵於本島登陸業已四十餘日，其主力軍約六師，計十萬左右，且其艦砲之猛擊日軍陣地晝夜不斷，日軍勁旅亦加反攻，將兵之奮戰情形，令人感泣。敵於沖繩戰綫之戰術，係採用破壞攻擊，其物量之雄厚及所發揮之機械力，　非身臨前綫者所能想像，即於正面攻擊前，首先以猛烈砲火切斷一切交通述絡路，因之高山與平地皆變原形，在熾烈之艦砲射擊掩護下，敵兵不顧一切，向登陸地點衝進。日軍精銳每日僅以麵包二隻充饑，絕不後退，衝鋒肉搏，隨時將敵軍擊退﹐現第一綫已由東方伸展至我謝，前田南方至阿波茶一帶，敵軍進至此地需時四十餘日，兵員軍需之消耗甚鉅，敵戰車備擱坐四五輛，將侵入之敵兵一舉而減其三千二百餘名，正面敵軍之二十七師及第十六師，幾已全軍覆沒。因是，敵軍乃不得不交替作戰軍隊，最近敵軍似已將第七師及海軍第一師布置戰塲正面，欲期增強作戰陣容，又常以黑人部隊爲前鋒，美軍兵力則處於督戰地位，然此等新編隊於海空各方掩護下前仆後繼，對日軍陣地執　猛攻，其戰意亦絕不容輕視。又敵軍當茲沖繩戰熾烈化之際，又開始實施謀略戰，由飛機散布小型報紙「沖繩週報」，企圖擾亂日軍思想，然其謀略決不能動搖日軍軍心。</p>

<h3 id="c9">保甲與治安 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>—五月十二日在上海廣播電台演辭</p>
<p>保甲組織，是人民自助自治自衛的基本組織。所以，第一，保甲辦得好，則地方可收守望相助的功效，進一步可由社會公益經濟建設事業的互助合作辦法，達到改善社會風氣，健全社會組織的理想。第二，保甲辦得好，則地方人士的人力可以集中，用地方自己的人力，辦地方自己的事業，爲地方自治奠定基礎，爲革新及修明政治的推動力量。第三，保甲辦得好，自營團組織完密面健全，可以輔助軍警力量的不足，而實現人民自衛的理想。一切警備的地方事件，漸漸可由人民自已去協助辦理。小之則一時一地的治安，大之則一國的安寗，都將受其裨益。在上述自助自治自衛中問，我們今天特別着重自衛一點，和本市各界談談保甲與治安。</p>
<p>現在上海市民負擔着龐大的治安維持費，這是因爲保甲組織尚未充分發揮其協力治安的作用的結果。假使保甲組織已能利用人民大部分自己的力量來協力維持地方治安，那麽，政府的軍警方面開支，就可以節省一大筆，或使現有的軍警擔負起國家的更重大的使命。這樣，直接可以減輕人民的負擔，間接可望國家的力量更加充足。現在保甲組織朱能分任地方治安之責，雖有種種其他原因，最主要的還是人力財力問題。所以我在這裏特別希望市民諸君，以遠大的眼光，爲整個地方着想，實現「有力出力，有錢出錢」的原則。</p>
<p>從國內外的局勢來看，今後，上海的形勢不免更趨緊張，這是無容諱言的；退一步言，就本市社會經濟的動態來看，由於工業衰落，失業人員激增，前途的困難，也是可想而知的。中日當局，對於這一點，當然早有完密的準備，不過爲使政府的一切力量，能够運用到更有意義的方面去，如果能够通過保甲組織，而由我們市民自巴來担負或至少分担起維持治安的任務，那結果不是更好嗎？以盟邦日本爲例，戰時都市及鄉鎭的地方治安，也都由各地居民自動組織起來分祖，達成所謂「舉一億總力於作戰」，爲什麼我們就不應該這樣呢？何況在將來萬一上海戰地化的塲合，由市民自己來協助維持上海的治安，不是更有效嗎？</p>
<p>問題並不在原則上是否贊同，而是實行上的困難，這困難特別在於財力方面。例如自警團的整備，保甲警察化的訓練，治安設備的籌措，幾乎在在需要費用。但是，上海的殷富及工商界，是不是願意本「有錢出錢」之旨而努力呢？以最近辦理市救濟庫券的經驗來說，一個多月以來，民間運五億元的目標，尚未能達到；反觀一般豪富及暴利者揮霍在娛樂方面得金額，不必說一個月，就是一星期的數目，也就要數億元了！在這裏，我們不能不痛切地感到，我國人公益心和正義感的消沉，這樣的社會，難道沒有沉淪的一天嗎？</p>
<p>但是我們必須提醒每一位上海的殷富與市民：戰爭的火燄可能逼近上海，如果你們今後再是這樣只重私利﹐不識時勢，則今日對治安事業吝於出錢，也許明天就要自已呑嚥這種無公益心的惡果！不是危言聳聽，古今中外不乏慘痛的敎訓，我們祈望的還是全市諸先覺者速起而倡導，輸財出力，健全保甲，鞏固治安，建立起人民自助自治自衛的大上海。</p>

<h3 id="c19">中國靑年的前途 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 林俊夫</p>
<p>最近，承新世紀月刋社得邀請，得有機會和樊仲雲，楊光政，趙華星，柳雨生，處晚移各位先生同席，暢談中國靑年的現況與將來。出席該次座談會德日方人士，有代表戰時日本文化界德朝日新聞上海總局長和田齊，代表貫徹人生二十五年思想的日本現代軍人的駐華艦隊報道部員松本大尉等。在座各位，都能從青年的立塲率直對論中日靑年的各種問題。座談</p>
<p>政治力量與靑年</p>
<p>正如靑年座談席上所言，日本的靑年從赤色思想的狂飆裏再發見爲日本人的自已，昂揚國家的意識，完成昭和維新，貫徹人生二十五年的思想，而從事大東亞戰爭，這事是眞實的。反之，中國的靑年，則自中日事變以來，在現象上，則於南京，延安，重慶國權分裂或對立的狀態下，在和平親日，抗戰赤化，抗戰建國等等思想的混亂狀能裏，受着兵禍，以致目中不見爲思想或政治中心的國家及國策。結果﹐表面上，祗顧追求私利或出以可稱爲違反國家的行動者﹐爲數不少。這雖然是事實，但不能以此即認爲中國靑年國家意識淺薄，或全無國家意識。例如明治維新以前看脫了國家存在的日本靑年，祗要施以說明日本歷史﹐指出日本國家應進之途的敎育，一般都有使其理解它實現它的國家意識與愛國精神潛在着。今日的狀能，相信並非中國靑年的缺點，毋寗是領導他們教育他們的政府或指導者的責任。從而和平區，特別是上海的靑年，並非不好，和延安重慶比較起來，南京國民政府的靑年指導及政治方策，可說不足領導靑年。</p>
<p>不過，正如座談席上說明的﹐重慶或延安政權治下的靑年們，對政府的行政及社會的制度，正感不滿：這是事實。要之，解決中國尚未統一這個根本命題，乃是目前最須改善的緊急問題。</p>
<p>中國統一與靑年</p>
<p>無論南京也好，延安和重慶也好，不希望中國統一的政府與人民，在中國是不存在的；同樣，爲其背景的各外國也希求中國統一，不過他們的立塲富然逈異﹐其方法也是各不相關的。在第七次中共大會中﹐照理是一黨專政的中國共產黨主席毛澤東，卻發表宣言，希望成立完全由各黨各派組成的聯立政府，以國由承認延安政權而蠶食重慶。而重慶國民黨第六次全國代表大會上蔣介石亦希望創立以重慶國民黨爲中心的聯立政府，僅視重慶政權爲正常的政府，而使中共甘處「武裝政黨」的地位。他們的方針和手段雖則各異，但其希望全國統一則一。可是，這些都是以政府要人或政黨爲中心的想法，不能稱爲是眞正鑒察民意﹐顧盧民生，企圖發展國家民族的方策。換一句話說，在現狀之下，中國靑年中固然不乏有思想的靑年，但他們對於任何政權都不滿意，也不擁護。這從日本靑年的立塲來看，反是不能不同情的。</p>
<p>中國育年的前途</p>
<p>中國大陸廣大無垠，物力人力方面，冠於世界。而其位置，對於欲從印度經緬甸而反攻日本本土的英國，以及橫斷太平洋而圖迫近日本本部的美國，具有作爲最後兵站基地或不沉航空母艦的最高戰略價値。換一句話說，中國大陸今日已臨即將化爲日美英最後戰塲的前夜；這是大東亞戰爭的必然結果。不問日軍駐兵中國大陸與否，這是中國大陸必有的命運。在這個時候﹐中國靑年欲如何決定此國土的命運呢？迫日軍撤兵，引美英入中國大陸，而把國土民族　諸鴉片戰爭以來百餘年間歐美列强的帝國主義侵略嗎？抑協力日本，使大東亞戰爭於勝利擊中結束，而確保光榮的獨立自主呢？</p>
<p>筆者現在不想由南京，延安，重慶各政權的單純比較論來決定中國靑年的前途，因爲這不是對照政府或政府要人就可得到公正結論的問題，也不是現在政府的政治力軍事力可以決定的問題。</p>
<p>新世界月刋社得「靑年座談」，在高談闊論中不知不覺到了預定的時間，結局　提出了種種重要的問題，在未得結論以前就散會了。不過，縱然檢討得結論，現在或許也是不能發表出來的。</p>
<p>會後，筆者與柳雨生先生在燈火管制下的南京路上，邊想邊走，不交一語。分別時，柳先生說：「我的意見過後函告罷。」可是直到今日，尚未接到他的信。</p>
<p>而今晚，美機又將翱翔上海上空吧。（吉譯）</p>

<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　舊金山會議第一重難關波蘭問題及阿根廷問題，已由於多數票決的集體力量，照英美方面意見進行解決。惟波蘭問題，於蘇聯言乃極有重要性，故對阿根廷始終斷定其爲法西斯國家，關於該問題在全體會議中業經通過，惟蘇聯並不因此退步，尤以蘇聯已完全從戰爭中解放，其將在國際政治上出以強硬態度，爲必然之事實。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫返國前書面提五項意見</p>
<p>莫洛托夫在對德作戰結束後，於十日返國，渠離舊金山前，曾向舊金山會議用書面提出五點：　在國際安全機構中，不能與法西斯國家採取共同動作，蓋法西斯國家爲反動之中心戰爭的根本原因。　外界有主張將戰爭期內締結之國際諸條約，在會議中提出檢討，此不但中敵奸計，且侵害締約國主權。　蘇聯現與英·法·捷克·南斯拉夫·波蘭等締結互助條約，有効期間二十年，此爲防止侵略之應取措置﹐在該國未認爲國際安全保陣機構力量足以防止侵略以前，當然應予繼續。　關於安全理事會，並不提議改變其任務與地位，會議主持國意見已完全一致。　關於殖民地調整問題議論紛紛，但英美意見對立，蘇聯爲維持國際安全，主張使殖民地成爲獨立國，早日實現民族自主平等。於五點提議之後，並結論稱，會議應在此二三週內審議各項根本問題，樹立戰後安全機構之基礎。莫洛托夫之提議，第一點係針對阿根廷而發，第二點對付美代表溫特伯克之提案，第三點可以表示蘇聯不十分信任國際機構。如蘇聯態度依然不改，則舊金山會議必得不良結果。最後關於殖民地調整問題，可以表明蘇聯已開始國際政治攻勢。英美兩國因兩足深陷對日作戰泥沼中，故希望歐戰早日結束，惟前途猶多困難，相反蘇聯則已脫離戰爭，抱「完全勝利」之傲慢態度，以全部力量用於國際政治，而莫洛托夫之書面提議，爲蘇聯政治攻勢之第一聲。</p>
<p>國際委治制問題英美蘇意見對立</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　國際委治問題，又成爲舊金山會議之僵局。頃據舊金山電稱，蘇代表遜波利亞於五國檢討委治制會談中，提議對一切殖民地予以獨立。紐約某報十六日發表如次：英美法三國對蘇聯之提案，在原則上不表反對，然此種事項與前於殖民地創設戰略基地之計劃將有影響，尤其蘇聯對此種提案，態度甚爲積極。十日夜五國再度會議，重事檢討，但其詳細內容不明。按蘇聯之提案，關於新機構憲章一點，不僅適用於有主權之國家，即附屬地域亦適用之。又該項提案與美國案戊英國案互爲對立，目殖民地帝國之法國，對殖民地之自治加以反對，故舊金山會議前途實爲暗澹也</p>

<h3 id="c36">金證券發行後　通行緊縮收效　準備金管委會發表檢查公告 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行金證劵，已於本月七日至九日止，開始第一期發行，其發行總額，已由金證劵發行準備金管理委員會，於十一日舉行第一次檢查發表公告，計發行總額爲一萬三千九百五十七兩，中備並將金證劵準備金總量黃金一千四百條，交付該會，指定本市銀聯會庫房存儲，以備到期兌付。該金證劵發行後，關於通貨緊縮及物價變化之一般情形，頗爲各方所關注。記者昨向金融機關方而探詢，特誌如下：</p>
<p>大量通貨收回</p>
<p>中央儲備銀行此次奉準發行金證券，其目的爲緊縮通貨，維持通貨價值，　平物價，安定民生，增強戰時經濟·因過去發行通貨受交通運輸呆　影響，物資交流，殊欠圓滑，尤其上海投機事業猖獗，囤積居奇，操　市價。因　收買物資流入農村及丙地之通貨不易回流。　上海投機事業瘋狂，大部份通貨集中擁資者或非法商人手中，運用於投機事業。　金融機關定期存款日益減少。　物價轉輾騰漲，需用通貨益增，故日感通不敷洗通，政府準有值券之發行及提倡儲蓄運動等種種辦法，以期收回通貨，但收效頗詳，以致多數通貨流入投機者之手中作崇，致發生金融不安狀態，故此次發行金證券爲緊縮通貨之上策。據金融證券發行準備金管理委員會第一次檢查報告，中儲七·八·九三天，首期發行總額爲一萬三千九百五十七　搜該行　　七十八萬體兩金額核算，計收回通貨達一百零八萬八千六百四十八萬元，如該行再經第二第三期發行以及金說劵推廣京蘇杭等檯中一幣發行，不獨上海收縮大部份通貨，即流入各地區之通貨，亦可絡續大量團流，此實爲　縮通貨之雄力，已獲宏效。中儲旣已收圓此項鉅額通貨，當龍收獲金融穩定之良好影。</p>
<p>物價止漲回平</p>
<p>因金證券之發行，收回大量通貨，投機事榮無法活動，物價止漲爲平·按過去市塲風氣。偶遇國際情勢變化，投機市僧，每每利用　費集中市　，　　黃金暴漲，公債及股票賡　一帆風順，扶搖眞上，金融頓呈不安現狀，囤積居奇猖獗，擁賢者操縱市價，狂漲不巳，最近歐局轉變，對於市塲激刺性極大，因絡於中　發行金證劵後，一百億元通貨收回，投機市儈無力活動，黃金暗市及股票開拍，始終盤旋堅定，即各種商品亦無劇漲之可能，否則定有一番騷動。</p>
<p>首期發行總額</p>
<p>中央儲備銀行發行之金證劵，第一期於本月七八九三天出復後，即將售出金融券數根存帳目，及應行存儲之同額準備金金額﹐交付金證券發行準備金管理委員會，於本月十一日在該委員會指定庫房，就金證劵發行準備金舉行第一次檢查·經該會檢查組值月委員葉扶　（上海特別市銀行業同業公會代表）裴　鄉（上海特別市錢莊業同業公會代表）檢查相符，當將檢查結果，　報財政部備案外﹐幷發表公告﹐以昭信實。其檢查結果報告如下：　中央備備銀行金證券發行總額，三十四年五月九日止，萬三千九百五十七兩。　本委員會庫存金證劵準備金總量﹐黃金一千四百條，共一萬四千零一兩五錢四分九釐。</p>

<p>本市警察局保甲處實局，以保甲工作，爲地方目治工作之一種，辦理保甲工作者，應具有熱心公益及者孚衆望之人士充任，故本市編組保甲暫行辦法第十二條規定，各級保甲人員之產生，須由各該保甲之下一級保甲人員公推，呈處核定。惟以本市保甲在租界未收回時，各區機構組織，各不相同，施行辦法亦非一律，比經該處整理革新，漸使統一，而在此整理期內，頗難遊行前項民選辦法，惟有援引編查保甲暫行辦法第十三條之規定，從權辦理。現在市區保甲編組已歸統一，整理告一段落，市民對保甲人士，亦漸深切，今後保甲人員，如有更動情事，即可產生，實行公推辦法·舉凡各該甲長·保長·聯保長等，應以開會公選。爰訂定辦法如下：</p>

<p>在戰時，公用事業的緊　限制，自有必要、因此、在原則上是無可非議的。不過，公用事業有關公衆福利的、　　限制應有比較合理的標準，而不能　隨便便任意爲之。</p>
<p>響如電力與自來水同爲公用事業，但其在公衆生活上需要之程度，絕不相同，電力限制，可以代用品替代，充其量稍感不便而已。而自來水就不同了，目前雖有井水可代，但設井目的在於自來水發生損害以後而　用，究以消毒等之不完備，未能用爲飲料。況且，夏令即屆，洗滌衛生，在在需水，所以，自來水之緊縮限制，決不能與電力同樣比例的。</p>
<p>可是，水電公司當局，似乎並未顧到上述各點，而將自來水限制極嚴，用量銷逾限度，即予鉅額罰款。遵守限度，則不敖使用；超逾限度，則受罰極鉅，使人興動　得咎之苦。</p>
<p>總之，戰時公用事業，雖不能完全顧到公衆利益﹐但自來水一項，爲生活必需品·無論如何應維持最低限度的供給量，同時，更不能忽視自來水與淸　衛生之關係，希望有關當局亟爲調整。</p>

<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) -- As the war situation intensifies, the task of reporting and propaganda becomes increasingly important. In particular, the reporting and propaganda of military, diplomatic, and political affairs require unified and rational implementation. Recognizing this, the Japanese government, centered on the Information Bureau, has conducted thorough research with relevant departments of the Army, Navy, Foreign Affairs, and Greater East Asia Ministries. A plan has been agreed upon, passed by the Cabinet, and announced by the Information Bureau on the 12th. It is said that the purpose of this measure is to combine the military reporting affairs of the Army and Navy Ministries with the diplomatic reporting affairs of the Foreign Affairs and Greater East Asia Ministries. At the same time, to adapt to the strengthening of local administrative organizations and the establishment of a news system under extraordinary circumstances, the aim is to strengthen and improve local reporting and propaganda organizations to cope with wartime emergencies. The full text of the Information Bureau's announcement is recorded below: The Japanese government, in order to adapt to the current war situation and to implement diplomatic and political reporting, propaganda, and enlightenment work in a unified and powerful manner, has decided on the following matters in the Cabinet meeting: 1. Reorganize the Information Bureau to streamline and strengthen its structure. 2. To implement military reporting and propaganda, add a department to the Information Bureau to handle the affairs currently handled by the Army Ministry's Reporting Department and the Navy Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, Section 4. 3. Transfer a portion of the Foreign Affairs and Greater East Asia Ministries' current diplomatic announcements and external propaganda affairs to the Information Bureau's Third Department. 4. Strengthen and improve local reporting and propaganda organizations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) -- The Japanese Army and Navy Ministries announced on the 12th that the Army Reporting Department and the Navy Reporting Department of the General Headquarters will be merged to form the General Headquarters Reporting Department. Major General Hideitsu Matsumura of the Army will be appointed as the Director of the General Headquarters Reporting Department, and Rear Admiral Etsuzo Kurihara of the Navy will be appointed as the Deputy Director. The staff of the General Headquarters Reporting Department will also serve concurrently as staff of the Information Bureau.</p>

<p>Kamikaze and Special Attack Units Engage in Fierce Ramming Attacks</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) -- Japanese submarine units have launched fierce attacks on mobile units and ship groups cruising in the waters off Okinawa, inflicting great damage on the enemy. On the 7th of this month, an enemy aircraft carrier group was discovered off the Iwo Jima Islands, and accurate fire was immediately carried out, sinking one special aircraft carrier. According to announcements from the General Headquarters or telegrams from the local area, the active situation of Japanese submarine units in the Okinawa waters can be seen. The submarine units have sunk a total of ten enemy ships, including one special aircraft carrier, delivering a major blow to the enemy's attempt to transport army troops as the Okinawa battle is about to enter the supply battle stage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) -- On the morning of the 11th, Japanese air units attacked enemy ships in the waters east of Ryukyu, sinking one unidentified ship at 8:00 AM and another unidentified ship at 8:50 AM. On the same morning, special attack units also attacked enemy aircraft carriers in the waters east of Okinawa, damaging one regular aircraft carrier. In addition, from the evening of the 10th to the dawn of the 11th, Japanese air units attacked the northern airport of Okinawa Island, setting it ablaze and causing great damage.</p>
<p>Southwest Islands Base, 12th (Central News Agency) -- On the morning of the 11th, Japanese Kamikaze special attack units captured enemy mobile units in the waters east of Okinawa Island and launched sure-hit ramming attacks on large aircraft carriers and other ships. On the 11th, enemy aircraft launched approximately 240 sorties against the island chain.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Forces Have the Advantage in the Air War <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 12th (Central News Agency) -- The U.S. air power in the Okinawa area has been repeatedly reduced due to continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese forces on ships and airfields. Particularly noteworthy is the sharp decrease in carrier-based aircraft due to the loss of aircraft carriers, with land-based aircraft accounting for two-thirds of the total sorties. The enemy's main airfields for land use, the northern and central airfields, have been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army and cannot be used as desired. The Ie Shima airfield is still under construction. In the air war, the Japanese forces are gradually gaining an advantageous position. The enemy's land-based aircraft operating on the island are mainly small aircraft, numbering about seventy or eighty. About seventy ships are concentrated off Ie Shima and are working hard to maintain the airfield and supply work.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) -- According to a dispatch from Guam, Nimitz Headquarters released the following war situation bulletin on the 12th: From the night of the 10th to the morning of the 11th, Japanese air units made several formations to attack the U.S. Pacific Fleet near Okinawa, but remained conservatively silent regarding the damage suffered by the U.S. warships in the above attacks. According to the above bulletin, the Japanese army's strenuous fighting on land was also mentioned: The Japanese army launched its fierce attacks and numerous land counterattacks, and the battles on the night of the 10th were intense and continuous.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) -- According to a telegram from Guam on the 11th relayed by Chongqing, U.S. Pacific Fleet warships and carrier-based aircraft, as well as Marine Corps aircraft, attacked Japanese facilities in the southern part of Ryukyu Island on the 9th. On the same evening, Japanese aircraft attacked U.S. ships in the waters of Greater Ryukyu, damaging two U.S. auxiliary ships, and Japanese aircraft bombed airfields. On the morning of the 10th, Japanese aircraft attacked U.S. convoys and local facilities twice. On the 10th, the U.S. Marine Corps 6th Division built a bridge across a river on Greater Ryukyu Island. On the morning of the 11th, when building a bridge, they suffered considerable losses due to the Japanese army's human-bullet resistance, and their progress was obstructed. Currently, Japanese and U.S. forces are engaged in hand-to-hand combat in several locations on the southern part of Greater Ryukyu Island.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Fierce Land Battles in Progress <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Southern Frontline Base, 12th (Central News Agency) -- Since the 9th, the enemy has launched a full-scale offensive on Okinawa Island again. On the 11th, they launched another forced attack. Near Maeda South and Awacha, the enemy, using tanks as cover, attacked with about 1,000 infantrymen, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese defenders. At the same time, the enemy's left-wing actions also became active. At 6:00 AM on the 10th, forty ships crossed the river in front of our Xiezhi. The Japanese army fought fiercely with them for an hour and finally repelled them. At 11:00 AM, powerful infantry with thirty amphibious tanks again launched a forced river crossing and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. Currently, enemy ships that can be seen from the land around the island include two cruisers and thirty medium-sized transport ships, and about one hundred others in the Kadena sea area. In Nakagusuku Bay, there are two battleships, seven destroyers or transport ships, thirteen medium-sized transport ships. Around the Kerama Islands, there is one converted aircraft carrier, two cruisers, twenty transport ships, and twenty destroyers or transport ships, moving back and forth. At noon on the 10th, a powerful force of two aircraft carriers, two battleships, five cruisers, destroyers, and eighteen large and medium transport ships appeared in the Itoman sea area, indicating that the enemy's determination cannot be underestimated.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) -- The Japanese government has repeatedly urged the U.S. government to respond regarding the lives of the passengers and crew of the Awamaru. According to the Swedish government, the U.S. government's notification was transmitted to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 11th, stating that only one survivor, Bok Oh Kanshiro, remains.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Asahi Correspondent Reports on the Bloody Battle of Okinawa Island: Mountains and Plains All Deformed <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) -- So Sadatoshi, a special correspondent from the Asahi Shimbun's Okinawa branch, resolutely stayed on Okinawa Island to report on the bloody battle near Okinawa Island, sharing the hardships with the army and navy soldiers. The gist of his first report from the army is as follows: The enemy has landed on the island for more than forty days, with its main force of about six divisions, totaling about 100,000. Their naval artillery has been relentlessly shelling the Japanese army's positions day and night. The Japanese army's elite troops are also launching counterattacks, and the soldiers' heroic fighting is moving. The enemy's tactics on the Okinawa front are to adopt destructive attacks. The abundance of their supplies and the mechanical power they exert are unimaginable to those who are not on the front line. Before launching a frontal attack, they first use fierce artillery fire to cut off all communication and transportation routes. As a result, mountains and plains are deformed. Under the cover of intense naval artillery fire, enemy soldiers rush to the landing points regardless of everything. Japanese elite troops eat only two pieces of bread a day, never retreating, charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, repelling the enemy at any time. The front line has now stretched from the east to Iezu, south of Maeda to the Awacha area. It has taken the enemy more than forty days to advance to this place, and the consumption of personnel and military supplies has been enormous. Enemy tanks have been left stranded for four or five, and 3,200 enemy soldiers have been reduced in one fell swoop. The enemy's 27th Division and 16th Division on the front have been almost completely annihilated. As a result, the enemy has had to alternate combat troops. Recently, the enemy seems to have deployed the 7th Division and the 1st Marine Division to the front of the battlefield, intending to strengthen its combat lineup. They often use black troops as the vanguard, while the U.S. troops are in a supervisory position. However, these newly formed teams, under the cover of air and sea, continue to press forward and launch fierce attacks on the Japanese army's positions, and their combat intent should not be underestimated. In addition, as the battle on Okinawa is intensifying, the enemy has also begun to implement a strategic war, distributing small newspapers "Okinawa Weekly" by aircraft in an attempt to disturb the Japanese army's thinking, but their strategy will never shake the Japanese army's morale.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Baojia and Public Security <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>— Speech delivered on May 12th at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>The Baojia organization is the basic organization for people's self-help, self-governance, and self-defense. Therefore, first, if the Baojia is well-managed, the local area can achieve the effect of mutual assistance and surveillance, and further, it can achieve the ideal of improving social customs and strengthening social organizations through mutual assistance and cooperation methods in social welfare and economic construction undertakings. Second, if the Baojia is well-managed, the local people's manpower can be concentrated, using the local people's own manpower to do their own local undertakings, laying the foundation for local autonomy, and becoming the driving force for reforming and clarifying politics. Third, if the Baojia is well-managed, the self-defense organization is complete and sound, it can supplement the insufficiency of the military and police forces, and realize the ideal of people's self-defense. All local security incidents can gradually be assisted by the people themselves. The security of a temporary or local area is small, and the security of a country is large, all of which will benefit from it. Among the above-mentioned self-help, self-governance, and self-defense, we particularly emphasize self-defense today and talk about Baojia and public security with all sectors of the city.</p>
<p>The citizens of Shanghai are now bearing a huge public security maintenance fee, which is the result of the Baojia organization not fully playing its role in assisting public security. If the Baojia organization can use most of the people's own strength to assist in maintaining local public security, then the government's military and police expenditures can save a large sum, or make the existing military and police undertake more significant national missions. In this way, the burden on the people can be directly reduced, and the strength of the country can be indirectly increased. Now the Baojia organization Zhu can take responsibility for local public security, although there are various other reasons, the most important is the issue of manpower and financial resources. Therefore, I especially hope that the citizens here will take a long-term perspective, think for the entire local area, and realize the principle of "exerting effort if you have strength, and contributing money if you have money."</p>
<p>Judging from the domestic and international situation, in the future, the situation in Shanghai will inevitably become more tense, which is undeniable; taking a step back, judging from the socio-economic dynamics of the city, due to the decline of industry and the surge in unemployment, the difficulties ahead are also conceivable. The Chinese and Japanese authorities, of course, have long had complete preparations for this point, but in order to enable all the government's strength to be used in a more meaningful way, if we can assume or at least share the task of maintaining public security through the Baojia organization, wouldn't the result be better? Taking our ally Japan as an example, the local public security of cities and towns during the war is also divided by the local residents themselves, achieving the so-called "exerting one hundred million total power in combat", why shouldn't we do this? What's more, in the event that Shanghai becomes a war zone in the future, wouldn't it be more effective for the citizens to assist in maintaining Shanghai's public security themselves?</p>
<p>The problem is not whether to agree in principle, but the difficulty in practice. This difficulty lies particularly in the financial resources. For example, the improvement of the self-defense corps, the training of Baojia police, and the fundraising of security equipment all require expenses. However, are the wealthy and business circles in Shanghai willing to work hard in accordance with the principle of "contributing money if you have money"? Taking the recent experience of handling municipal relief bonds, the goal of mobilizing 500 million yuan from the private sector has not been achieved in more than a month; looking at the amount of money squandered on entertainment by the general wealthy and profiteers, not to mention a month, even the amount in a week will be hundreds of millions of yuan! Here, we cannot help but deeply feel the decline of the public spirit and sense of justice of our people. Will such a society not have a day of decline?</p>
<p>But we must remind every wealthy and citizen of Shanghai: the flames of war may be approaching Shanghai. If you continue to value only private interests and do not recognize the situation, then today you are stingy to contribute money to the public security cause, and perhaps tomorrow you will have to swallow the bitter fruit of this lack of public spirit yourself! It is not alarmist, there is no shortage of tragic lessons in ancient and modern times. What we hope for is that the enlightened people of the city will quickly rise up to advocate, contribute money and effort, strengthen Baojia, consolidate public security, and establish a self-helping, self-governing, and self-defending Greater Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Future of Chinese Youth <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Junfu</p>
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity, thanks to an invitation from the New Century Monthly, to sit with Mr. Fan Zhongyun, Mr. Yang Guangzheng, Mr. Zhao Huaxing, Mr. Liu Yusheng, and others to discuss the current situation and future of Chinese youth. Among the Japanese present at the symposium were Mr. Wada Hitoshi, the Shanghai Director-General of the Asahi Shimbun, representing the wartime Japanese cultural sphere, and Captain Matsumoto of the Fleet Reporting Division, representing the Japanese modern military, who advocated the "25-Year Life Philosophy." Everyone present was able to frankly discuss various issues concerning Chinese and Japanese youth from the perspective of youth.</p>
<p>Political Power and Youth</p>
<p>As mentioned in the youth symposium, Japanese youth, after rediscovering themselves as Japanese from the storms of red ideology, have vigorously promoted national consciousness, completed the Showa Restoration, implemented the "25-Year Life Philosophy," and engaged in the Greater East Asia War. This is a fact. Conversely, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Chinese youth, phenomenologically, have been in a state of divided or opposing national power in Nanjing, Yan'an, and Chongqing. They have been subjected to the chaos of ideologies such as peaceful pro-Japanese sentiment, resistance and redification, and resistance and national construction, as well as the disasters of war, to the extent that they no longer see the nation and its policies as the center of their thoughts or politics. As a result, on the surface, many only pursue personal gain or engage in actions that could be described as violating the nation. While this is a fact, it cannot be immediately assumed that Chinese youth have a shallow or non-existent sense of national consciousness. For example, Japanese youth before the Meiji Restoration seemed to have lost sight of the existence of the nation. However, as long as they were given education explaining Japanese history and pointing out the path that Japan should take, they generally understood and realized the potential for national consciousness and patriotism within them. The current situation, I believe, is not the fault of Chinese youth but rather the responsibility of the government or leaders who lead and educate them. Consequently, the youth in the peace zones, especially in Shanghai, are not bad. Compared to Yan'an and Chongqing, the Nanjing National Government's youth guidance and political policies are arguably insufficient to lead the youth.</p>
<p>However, as explained in the symposium, the youth under the governance of the Chongqing or Yan'an regimes are dissatisfied with the government's administration and social systems. This is a fact. In essence, resolving the fundamental issue of China's lack of unification is the most urgent problem that needs to be improved.</p>
<p>China's Unification and Youth</p>
<p>Whether in Nanjing, Yan'an, or Chongqing, there is no government or people in China who do not hope for China's unification. Similarly, the foreign countries behind them also desire China's unification, but their positions are vastly different, and their methods are unrelated. At the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong, the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, which is supposedly under one-party rule, issued a declaration hoping to establish a coalition government composed entirely of all parties and factions, to have the nation recognize the Yan'an regime and gradually encroach upon Chongqing. At the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang in Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek also hoped to create a coalition government centered on the Chongqing Kuomintang, viewing the Chongqing regime as the only legitimate government, while positioning the CCP as merely an "armed political party." Although their policies and methods differ, their desire for national unification is the same. However, these are ideas centered on government officials or political parties and cannot be described as policies that truly understand the will of the people, consider the livelihoods of the people, and aim to develop the nation and its people. In other words, in the current situation, there is no shortage of thoughtful youth in China, but they are dissatisfied with and do not support any regime. From the perspective of Japanese youth, this is something that one cannot help but sympathize with.</p>
<p>The Future of Chinese Youth</p>
<p>The Chinese mainland is vast and boundless, with abundant resources and manpower, surpassing the world. Its location is of utmost strategic value to Britain, which seeks to counterattack the Japanese mainland via India and Burma, and to the United States, which aims to approach the Japanese mainland across the Pacific Ocean, serving as a final supply base or an unsinkable aircraft carrier. In other words, the Chinese mainland is on the eve of becoming the final battlefield between Japan, the United States, and Britain. This is the inevitable result of the Greater East Asia War. Regardless of whether Japanese troops are stationed on the Chinese mainland, this is the inescapable fate of the Chinese mainland. At this time, how will Chinese youth decide the fate of this land? Will they force the Japanese troops to withdraw, invite the United States and Britain into the Chinese mainland, and subject the country and its people to the imperialist aggression of European and American powers for over a century since the Opium Wars? Or will they cooperate with Japan to bring the Greater East Asia War to a victorious conclusion and secure glorious independence and autonomy?</p>
<p>I do not want to determine the future of Chinese youth based on a simple comparison of the Nanjing, Yan'an, and Chongqing regimes, because this is not a question that can be fairly concluded by comparing governments or government officials, nor is it something that can be decided by the political or military power of the current government.</p>
<p>The "Youth Symposium" of the New World Monthly, amidst high-sounding discussions, unknowingly reached its scheduled time, and the conclusion raised various important questions before adjourning without a conclusion. However, even if a conclusion were reached, it might not be possible to publish it now.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Mr. Liu Yusheng and I walked along Nanjing Road under the blackout, thinking without exchanging a word. At the parting, Mr. Liu said, "I will inform you of my opinion in a letter later." However, to this day, I have not received his letter.</p>
<p>And tonight, American planes will once again soar over Shanghai. (Ji Yi)</p>

<h3 id="e30">Soviet Union Takes a Tough Stance on the Polish Issue - San Francisco Conference Prospects Dim <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) – The first major hurdle of the San Francisco Conference, the Polish and Argentine issues, has been resolved in accordance with the views of the British and American sides through the collective power of majority votes. However, the Polish issue is of extreme importance to the Soviet Union, which has consistently determined Argentina to be a fascist state. Although the issue was passed in the plenary session, the Soviet Union did not retreat. Especially since the Soviet Union has been completely liberated from the war, it is inevitable that it will adopt a tough stance in international politics.</p>
<p>Molotov Submits Five Points in Writing Before Returning Home</p>
<p>Before returning home on the 10th after the end of the war against Germany, Molotov submitted five points in writing to the San Francisco Conference:</p>
<p>*   No joint action can be taken with fascist countries in international security institutions, as fascist countries are the root cause of reactionary centers and wars.</p>
<p>*   Some are advocating for the review of international treaties concluded during the war in the conference. This would not only fall into the enemy's trap but also infringe upon the sovereignty of the contracting states.</p>
<p>*   The Soviet Union has concluded mutual assistance treaties with Britain, France, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland, with a validity period of 20 years. This is a necessary measure to prevent aggression and should continue until these countries believe that the international security guarantee mechanism is strong enough to prevent aggression.</p>
<p>*   Regarding the Security Council, there is no proposal to change its mission and status, and the opinions of the conference hosting countries are completely consistent.</p>
<p>*   There is much discussion about the issue of colonial adjustment, but British and American opinions are in opposition. In order to maintain international security, the Soviet Union advocates that colonies become independent states and that national autonomy and equality be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After the five proposals, Molotov concluded that the conference should review various fundamental issues within these two or three weeks and establish the foundation for a post-war security mechanism. Molotov's first point was directed at Argentina, the second against the proposal of US representative Winter Burke, and the third could indicate that the Soviet Union does not fully trust international institutions. If the Soviet Union's attitude remains unchanged, the San Francisco Conference will inevitably yield poor results. Finally, regarding the issue of colonial adjustment, it can be seen that the Soviet Union has begun an international political offensive. Britain and the United States are deeply mired in the war against Japan, so they hope for an early end to the European war. However, many difficulties remain ahead. In contrast, the Soviet Union has emerged from the war, holding an attitude of arrogance of "complete victory" to use its full force in international politics, and Molotov's written proposal is the first sound of the Soviet Union's political offensive.</p>
<p>International Trusteeship System Issue - British, American, and Soviet Opinions in Opposition</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) – The international trusteeship issue has once again become a deadlock at the San Francisco Conference. According to reports from San Francisco, Soviet representative Zun Polia proposed to grant independence to all colonies in the five-nation consultation on the trusteeship system. A certain New York newspaper published the following on the 16th: Britain, the United States, and France did not express opposition to the Soviet Union's proposal in principle, but this matter would affect plans to establish strategic bases in the colonies. The Soviet Union's attitude towards this proposal is particularly positive. The five countries met again on the night of the 10th to review the matter, but the detailed contents are unknown. According to the Soviet proposal, the new agency's charter would apply not only to sovereign states but also to subordinate regions. This proposal is in opposition to both the American and British proposals. France, a colonial empire, opposes the autonomy of colonies, so the prospects for the San Francisco Conference are indeed bleak.</p>

<p>Zurich, 12th (Central News Agency) – According to the Associated Press from Berlin: It is reported that Soviet forces finally discovered four sets of remains resembling Führer Hitler in the underground fortress of the Reich Chancellery.

Soviet authorities seem to believe that one of the bodies is the remains of Führer Hitler.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Tightening Effect of Gold Securities Issue - Preparation Committee Announces Inspection Notice <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank's gold securities began their first phase of issuance from the 7th to the 9th of this month. The total amount issued has been announced by the Gold Securities Issuance Preparation Committee at its first inspection on the 11th. The total amount issued was 13,957 taels. The Bank also delivered 1,400 gold bars, the total amount of the gold securities reserve, to the Committee, designating the Shanghai United Bank's vault for storage in preparation for redemption at maturity. After the issuance of these gold securities, the general situation regarding currency tightening and price changes has been of great concern to all parties. A reporter inquired with financial institutions yesterday and recorded the following:</p>
<p>Large Amount of Currency Recalled</p>
<p>The purpose of the Central Reserve Bank's approved issuance of gold securities is to tighten the currency supply, maintain the value of the currency, stabilize prices, stabilize people's livelihoods, and strengthen the wartime economy. In the past, the issuance of currency was affected by transportation stagnation, hindering the smooth exchange of goods, especially with rampant speculation in Shanghai, hoarding for profit, and manipulating market prices. The currency used to buy goods flowing into rural areas and other places was difficult to recycle. Speculation in Shanghai was rampant, with most of the currency concentrated in the hands of wealthy or illegal merchants, who used it for speculation. The fixed deposits of financial institutions were decreasing daily. Rising prices required increasing amounts of currency, so the government implemented various measures such as issuing value vouchers and promoting savings movements to recover currency. However, the results were poor, leading to a large amount of currency flowing into the hands of speculators, causing financial instability. Therefore, the issuance of gold securities is a superior strategy for tightening the currency supply. According to the first inspection report of the Gold Securities Issuance Preparation Committee, the first phase of issuance totaled 13,957 taels in the three days of the 7th, 8th, and 9th. After calculating the amount of 780,000 taels, a total of 108,864,800 yuan was recovered. If the Bank continues with the second and third phases of issuance and promotes the issuance of gold securities in cities such as Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, not only will a large amount of currency be tightened in Shanghai, but also the currency flowing into various regions can be gradually and substantially reduced. This is truly a powerful force for currency tightening and has achieved significant results. Now that the Central Reserve Bank has recovered this huge amount of currency, it should reap the benefits of financial stability.</p>
<p>Price Increases Halted and Stabilized</p>
<p>Due to the issuance of gold securities and the recovery of a large amount of currency, speculative activities have been unable to function, halting price increases and stabilizing them. According to past market trends, when international situations change, speculators often take advantage of concentrated funds in the market to cause gold prices to skyrocket and public bonds and stocks to rise smoothly and rapidly, causing financial instability, rampant hoarding for profit, manipulation of market prices by the wealthy, and unrestrained price increases. Recently, the changes in the European situation have had a great stimulating effect on the market. Because the Central Reserve Bank issued gold securities, 10 billion yuan of currency was recovered, speculators were unable to operate, and the black market for gold and the opening of stocks have remained stable. Various commodities are also unlikely to experience drastic price increases; otherwise, there would have been turmoil.</p>
<p>Total Amount of First Phase Issuance</p>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank's gold securities, after the first phase was issued in the three days of the 7th, 8th, and 9th of this month, immediately transferred the number of gold securities sold, the relevant account books, and the amount of the corresponding reserve to be stored to the Gold Securities Issuance Preparation Committee. The Committee conducted the first inspection of the gold securities issuance reserve at the designated vault on the 11th of this month. The inspection team, consisting of Committee members Ye Fu (representative of the Shanghai Special City Banking Association) and Pei Xiang (representative of the Shanghai Special City Money Shop Association), confirmed that the results were consistent and reported them to the Ministry of Finance for record and issued a public announcement to ensure credibility. The results of the inspection are reported as follows:</p>
<p>*   Total amount of Central Reserve Bank gold securities issued, as of May 9, 34th year: 13,957 taels.</p>
<p>*   Total amount of gold securities reserve stored in the Committee's vault: 1,400 gold bars, totaling 14,001 taels, 5 qian, 4 fen, and 9 li.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Constant Vigilance for Blackout - Hope for Strict Compliance - Statement by Air Defense Headquarters <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Air Defense Headquarters issued the following statement: On the 10th of this month, the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command issued a notice stating: Regarding the blackout, from May 15th onwards, regardless of whether there is an air raid alarm, a stringent blackout will be enforced from 10 PM to sunrise the next day. In other words, preparation for the blackout will still be implemented as usual from sunset to 10 PM, but it should be especially noted that a stringent blackout should be implemented after 10 PM. In light of the recent frequent intrusions of enemy aircraft into Shanghai, it is urgently hoped that the general public will pay more attention to the blackout and actively cooperate in defending Shanghai. In the past, there have been cases of severe disasters caused by carelessness with the blackout. Headquarters has cited examples to urge citizens to pay attention, but the blackout situation cannot be described as good, especially as summer approaches and most windows are open, making it worse than in winter. It is hoped that citizens will pay full attention to the blackout from now on, so that such phenomena do not occur, and that there will be no violations, to ensure complete safety.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Yesterday's Tea Party for Newspaper Reporters to Bid Farewell to Director Liu <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Director Liu Dexuan of the Municipal Propaganda Department, due to a recurrence of an old illness requiring immediate rest, tendered his resignation. Reporters from various newspapers, appreciating Director Liu's effective guidance and pleasant demeanor during his four months in office, felt deeply reluctant to part ways. Therefore, they jointly held a farewell tea party at the Jinmen Hotel at 3 PM on the 12th. Director Liu arrived promptly, accompanied by Director Gu and others from the Propaganda Department. Director Liu delivered a speech, briefly stating: "I am extremely grateful for your warm reception today. I am particularly thankful for your cooperation during my tenure." He then encouraged the reporters from various newspapers, urging them to thoroughly report news and complete the task of promoting national policies. Subsequently, Zhu Yongkang delivered a speech on behalf of the reporters, briefly stating: "Director Liu's earnest instructions and ardent expectations will serve as our guiding principles. Although Director Liu's tenure was short, his benefits to the press were profound. For example, regarding the key supply allocation, Director Liu's repeated negotiations and efforts resulted in not only editors and reporters receiving it but also general news workers such as laborers receiving the same allocation, for which we are deeply grateful." Afterwards, everyone engaged in friendly conversation until they happily dispersed at 5 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Shipping Management Bureau Establishes Taihu Branch <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Military Affairs Commission's Special Shipping Management Bureau, in addition to establishing Shanghai and Nanjing branches successively, is now establishing a Taihu aquatic branch due to the abundance of products in the Taihu region, requiring smooth transportation to facilitate the exchange of goods. He Jianbai, a major general, has been appointed as the director, and Hu Zi as the deputy director. Mr. He came to Shanghai yesterday on official business and stated that the branch office will be located in Wujiang and will establish six sub-branches in the Taihu region of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, such as Huzhou, Yixing, Jiaxing, and border areas such as Changxi, Suwu, and Changxing, to promote the work.</p>
<p>Expanding the Zhejiang East Sailing Route</p>
<p>The China Shipping Company has recently seen significant development in its sailing department's business and has decided to expand the Zhejiang East sailing route. It has entrusted an agent to specialize in direct sailings to Ningbo. It is reported that the route will have two round trips per week.</p>
<p>It is also learned that starting from the 12th, the company has re-designated Fuxin and Fusheng shipping companies as agents, utilizing express tugboats to tow civilian ships, sailing to new ports in northern Jiangsu, stopping along the way at Changxiansha, Zhanghuanggong, Xinshenggang, Huangshangang, Bawugang, Tianxingqiao, Yangzhong, and Dongxigang, and has formally started its service.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Rickshaw Strike Resolved, Resumption of Business Set for This Morning <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw Owners Must Not Arbitrarily Increase Rent</p>
<p>A rickshaw strike occurred in the city on the 12th. Vehicles disappeared from the streets, and some rickshaw pullers continued to operate as usual, leading to disturbances. The Municipal Police Bureau, to ensure public transportation and social order, strengthened its vigilance. The Fourth Section, led by Te Gao Yan Gen and others, investigated the situation. After inquiring with the person in charge of the rickshaw workers' union, it was reported that the rent for rickshaws, approved by the Construction Bureau, was 950 yuan per vehicle per day, but the rickshaw owners arbitrarily raised the price to 2,400 yuan per vehicle per day. With the cost of living rising daily, the rickshaw pullers could not bear the burden, hence the strike. They hoped that the authorities would make a fair judgment. The police bureau then summoned the person in charge of the Rickshaw Owners Association to mediate, ordering the rickshaw companies to adhere to the price limit set by the authorities of 950 yuan per vehicle per day to comply with the law. As for the need to increase rent due to the rising prices of rickshaw parts, the companies must submit a request to the Construction Bureau for detailed research, approval, and public announcement before implementation. After both parties agreed, a satisfactory resolution was reached. At the same time, the Construction Bureau ordered all rickshaw owners to comply with the original rent and not to arbitrarily increase it, and mandated that rickshaw pullers resume operations this morning.</p>

Passengers will not have to wait long to purchase tickets. At the same time, the East Asia Transportation Corporation hopes that citizens will work together to completely eliminate the black market by absolutely not buying black market tickets. If it is indeed difficult to purchase tickets, they can directly apply to the company, which will do its best to assist.</p>

It is hoped that those who have lost their belongings will claim them from the third section of the branch within three days.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Door-to-Door Vaccination Starts Today <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau's cholera vaccination teams in various districts have been actively promoting their work recently. To expand the coverage, they will implement door-to-door vaccinations starting on the 13th in conjunction with the Baojia Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Regular Public Elections for Baojia Workers, Lian Baojia Heads, etc. to Be Elected <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Baojia Section of the Municipal Police Bureau believes that Baojia work is a type of local self-governance work, and those who handle Baojia work should be enthusiastic about public welfare and be trustworthy individuals. Therefore, Article 12 of the Municipal Provisional Measures for Organizing Baojia stipulates that the selection of Baojia personnel at all levels must be publicly recommended by the lower-level Baojia personnel of the respective Baojia and submitted to the section for approval. However, because the organizations of various districts in the city were different before the recovery of the concessions, and the implementation methods were not uniform, the section has been reorganizing and innovating to gradually unify them. During this reorganization period, it was difficult to implement the aforementioned democratic election method. Therefore, it was only possible to refer to the provisions of Article 13 of the Provisional Measures for Compiling and Inspecting Baojia to handle the matter at its discretion. Now that the organization of Baojia in the urban area has been unified, and the reorganization has come to an end, citizens have gradually deepened their understanding of Baojia personnel. In the future, if there are changes in Baojia personnel, they can be produced and implemented through public recommendation. All Jia chiefs, Bao chiefs, and Lian Bao chiefs should be elected by meeting. The following methods have been formulated:</p>
<p>Preliminary Announcement of Suffering Day</p>
<p>Supervision of elections by personnel from higher-level Baojia organizations, police sub-bureaus, and the Baojia Section. If the Jia chief publicly recommends the Bao chief, the Lian Bao chief himself or a person sent by him will supervise the election. If the Bao chief publicly recommends the Lian Bao chief, the General Lian Bao chief himself or a person sent by him will supervise the election.</p>
<p>Meetings require the attendance of more than two-thirds of the people and the consent of more than two-thirds of those present.</p>
<p>Use a signed voting method. If the head of a household publicly recommends the Jia chief, the Bao chief himself must supervise the election. If it is not necessary, there is no need to request the police sub-bureau and Baojia Section to send personnel to the venue. After the personnel at all levels of the Baojia are recommended, they will be reported to the Baojia Section for approval and appointment.</p>
<p>This method has been submitted to the Baojia Section for approval and will be implemented from May 15th. In the future, the selection of Baojia personnel will adopt public recommendation, which will make it easier to select talents and advance the task. The Baojia organization should be further consolidated to strengthen local autonomy. The section specially issued orders to all General Lian Baos in various districts yesterday, the 12th, to comply with this.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Goods Allocation Office Adjusts Certificate Issuance Areas, Using the Newly Defined Baojia Areas as the Standard <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Goods Allocation Office previously established 24 certificate issuance offices within the city to facilitate citizens in obtaining certificates. The first office belongs to the Central District, the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth offices belong to the Eastern District, the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and twentieth offices belong to the Western District, the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth offices belong to the Southern District, the eighth, ninth, twenty-second, and twenty-third offices belong to the Northern District, the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth offices belong to the Nanshi District, the twenty-fourth office belongs to the Pudong District, and the twenty-first office belongs to the Central City District. By the autumn of last year, the city's jurisdiction had been redefined by the municipal government, and the office's certificate issuance areas also changed accordingly. The Nanhu Caozhen in Huxi and the Yangjing Eighteen Questions in the southern district of Pudong were designated as suburbs, and the areas west of the Huxi Railway, east of Zhongshan Road, and Bailianjing in Pudong were designated as urban areas. Because the allocation is based on the urban area, the areas that have been designated as suburbs by the municipal government will stop being allocated, and those that have been designated as urban areas should be allocated. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the seventh office in the Western District and the fourteenth office in the Second District of Pudong are slightly different than before. It is now heard that the office intends to gradually adjust the jurisdictions of the offices according to the newly defined Baojia areas by the municipal government, starting with the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth offices in the Nanshi District and the sixth, seventh, and twentieth offices in the Western District. It has instructed the offices to jointly determine and report to the office for processing. The locations of the various certificate issuance offices are listed below:</p>

<p>The Military Affairs Commission's Opium Prohibition Bureau, in response to the recent high prices that opium addicts in the city are paying to smoke private opium, which interferes with the government's opium prohibition policy, has ordered 135 opium retail shops, including Zhizhi Ji, to establish the Shanghai Special City Opium Retailers Joint Distribution Office. The original official opium will be sold everywhere by the police at a fixed official price: Western opium at 44,500 yuan per tael and Jiang opium at 26,500 yuan per tael (weight conforming to 98 standards). The distribution office has already been established in Ren'an Lane, Jiumu Di. Opium addicts in Shanghai can purchase opium at the official price there. Those who smoke private opium in violation of the prohibition order, those who do not report for voluntary abstinence, and those who have not obtained the third-period license will have their registration cancelled and will be punished for smoking private opium.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Water Supply Should Loosen Restrictions <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>During wartime, strict restrictions on public utilities are necessary and therefore, in principle, not to be criticized. However, restrictions on public utilities related to public welfare should have relatively reasonable standards and should not be arbitrarily imposed.</p>
<p>Like electricity, tap water is also a public utility, but the degree to which they are needed in public life is very different. Electricity restrictions can be replaced by substitutes, at most causing slight inconvenience. But tap water is different. Although well water can be used as a substitute, the purpose of setting up wells is for use after tap water is damaged. After all, disinfection is not complete, and it cannot be used as drinking water. Moreover, summer is coming, and water is needed everywhere for washing and hygiene. Therefore, the tightening of restrictions on tap water cannot be in the same proportion as electricity.</p>
<p>However, the authorities of the water and electricity company do not seem to have taken the above points into consideration and have severely restricted tap water. If the amount used exceeds the limit, a huge fine will be imposed. Complying with the limit will not be enough for use; exceeding the limit will result in a very large fine, making people suffer the pain of being punished no matter what they do.</p>
<p>In short, during wartime, public utilities cannot fully consider the public interest, but tap water, as a necessity of life, should maintain a minimum supply, and the relationship between tap water and cleanliness and hygiene should not be ignored. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will adjust this as soon as possible.</p>
