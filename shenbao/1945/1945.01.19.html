<p>社評</p>
<h3>勗孫良誠將軍</h3>
<p>去年十月間，國府明令蘇北綏靖主任項致莊氏，調任浙江省長，而以開封綏靖主任孫良誠將軍接任蘇北綏靖主任。孫主任即率其所部駐防蘇北，就任視事。日前孫氏因事來滬，蘇北旅滬各同鄉會爲表示歡迎，昨日聯合公宴孫氏，頗爲熟烈。</p>
<p>蘇北原是江蘇省的一部分，位於長江以北，行政系統原屬於江蘇省管轄。近年因事實上的便利，形成蘇北軍政獨立的區域，去年十月三十一日行政院會議，遵照駐蘇北綏靖主任公署暫行兼理蘇北行政要綱第二項之規定，劃定泰縣，東合，鹽城，興化，高郵，江都，寳應，儀徵，泰興，靖江，如皐，南通，海門，啓東，皐寗等十五縣，爲蘇北行政區。駐蘇北綏靖主任就是蘇北十五縣的實際軍政長官。</p>
<p>蘇北各縣，在經濟上的地位，不失爲殷實之區，自從新四軍發生皖南事件後，即竄避蘇北一帶，幾年以來，擴展勢力，爭取民衆，迷漫於蘇北全域，而當地原有地方雜色軍隊，更是五光十色，份子複雜，在相消相畏的拉鋸狀態下，各地人民疲於奔命，痛苦萬狀。舉例言之，如對軍隊需索，遲疑不允，則刑罰立至。晨間甲部隊到，騷擾一番，晚間乙部隊來，搜索一番。服侍了甲，乙不滿意，服侍了乙，申充臆子的就是安分守已的老百姓，也就是拳養這輩的老百姓。稍爲殷富的人民，尤爲若擊衆矢之的，因此入晚不能安枕，露突溝堅者有之，處身草棚者亦有之。家中被取一空，而明晶風面尤須恭維稱好。所謂紀律，蕩焉無存，所謂秋毫無犯，變成狀毫必犯，無一倖免。所以，在蘇北人民中，提到穿制服的人，無不深痛惡絕。</p>
<p>現在孫良誠將軍主持蘇北軍政，以孫將軍過去在西北軍的聲譽，紀律嚴明，秋毫無犯，留在我們的印象中，我們相信一定能够保持過去令譽，爲蘇北人民解除痛苦。誠如孫氏在蘇北同鄉歡迎會席上所說：「蘇北各地久爲新四軍摧殘，以及其他少數無聊隊伍騷擾，今後自當運用力量掃蕩新四軍，並整理雜色隊伍。」孫氏並引用諸葛武侯所說「鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已」的決心，我們相信蘇北人民已經有了「吾極泰來」的機會，可以喘息的機會了。</p>
<p>不過，在治軍方面固然重在紀律，不致擾民，但是還不免消極的。而在積極方面，更應負起確保治安的責任，確保治安，目前的實際工作，就是掃蕩新四軍與整理雜色隊伍，我們從客觀的情勢觀察，雜色隊伍原是烏合之衆，無訓練無智識，容易整理，而新四軍過去所做的雖也是擾民，可是，他們能够利用種種機會，抓取民心。所以，毋庸諱言的，在人民印象中的比較，雜色軍還不如新四軍，這是很値得重視的問題。所以，我們認爲蘇北情形特殊複雜，治理蘇北，不僅在軍事，同時政治並重，而軍事方面，勇敢之外，復需智謀，惟有智勇才可應付複雜局面，爭取民心。希望孫主任隨時關心智勇兼全的人才。</p>
<p>最後，「鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已」的精神，在近代眼光觀察，還不免是光榮的失敗，我們盼望孫將軍更進一步，做到竭盡智慮，成功後已。</p>
<h3>路政署謀改善　鐵道交通管理　辦法三項正審議中</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　邇來華中各鐵道交通管理，異常窳敗，致發現黑票交易，旅客寄運之行李，每遭失竊，以及車站之黑帽子非法敲詐，肆意勒索，於正當旅客之交通，妨碍至鉅，建設部路政署有鑒於此，於旬日前曾在滬召集華中鐵道公司及其他有關機關，舉行緊急會議，商討有效對策，結果訓令華鐵公司擬具有效辦法三項，呈部核准實施，建部正嚴密審議，與有關機關聯絡決定中。據記者得悉：該三項辦法爲：（一）如何消滅車票黑市交易，（二）如防止旅客寄遝行李，不使有失竊事件發生。（三）如何取締車站黑帽子之非法勒索行爲。</p>
<h3>日軍事武官　離開丹吉爾</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　海通社引倫敦消息，英外相又登昨向下院報吿丹吉爾情形稱：日本軍事武官，已離開丹吉爾</p>
<h3>美機員談　國共紛爭</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據華盛頓電：美民主黨議員曼斯伐特最近會以大總統特使資格赴重慶，視察政治經濟狀况，頃已返還美國，十六日於衆院舉行之秘密會席上，曾發表報吿如次：國民黨及延安政權對自黨之保全，均較對日「抗戰」更爲關心，一般人民對國民黨日增惶懼之原因，蓋因軍隊及徵稅吏之態度所致，國民黨雖口稱民主主義，而實際則爲獨栽行動。此外延安政樓對國外問題，不僅知識淺薄，且自擁軍隊，號稱救國，對重慶內部之各種問題，雖思設法解決，然如不能息止此紛爭。以致發生內亂，則勢將受某大國之干涉云。</p>
<h3>美國民徵用法　遭各界反對</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　華盛頓電，美總統羅斯福十七日向議會提出要求迅速實施國民徵用法之特別咨文，然國會以及政財界各方面，對此均作猛烈之反對運動，徵用法之前途，實爲困難。至於勞動界對此徵用法更表示反對，美勞動界二大團體之美國勞工聯合會及工業組織大會，因徵用法有影響勞動界之自由，已表明絕對反對，法案如果提空國會時，勢必展開猛烈之反對運動。同時，財界方面亦對徵用法未表好意，工業界代表機關之全國製造業協會，十六日晨發表反對聲明。</p>
<h3>英美蘇會談　日期地點決定</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據華盛頓電，英美蘇三巨頭會談之日期及塲所，十六日已決定，羅斯福爲出席該會談，近將由華盛頓出發。</p>
<p>百倫七八日中央社電　德國社引交換電訊社消息，在未來之羅斯福。邱吉爾·斯達林會議中，羅斯福總統將要求將太平洋之某部份基地，依據信托制度，重行分配。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　海通社訊，美方息，英·美·蘇會議之組織，突爲有關各國之困難工作。據瑞典日報駐紐約訪員稱，若美國堅持派遣代表四十八人參加該會，（每州派代表一人），則莫斯科亦欲派遣代表十八人，即每一蘇維埃共和國派遣代表一人，各方對參議員文頓倍成立四國同盟以維和平之建議，更爲重視。羅斯福總統或將該計劃提交三國會議討論，惟共黨領袖勃洛特對此表示反對，渠在紐約發表演說稱，該計劃係預防洪產主義在歐洲之傳布，此項態度殆係受莫斯科之授意，故華盛頓政界方面對此深表憂慮。倫敦方面認蘇聯駐英大使古塞夫之回國，爲三國會議已有更確定原則之徵象，軍事與政治問題，在會議中將佔有相等之地位。關於波蘭問題，斯達林希望他國對盧布林表明其態度，渠更願保證米柯拉席克與倫敦之其他波蘭領袖回至波蘭，不愛干涉，美國戰後之外交政策，將爲最重要問題之。斯達林將向羅斯福提出若干難以置答之問題，如美軍留在歐洲之時期，美國於戰後對歐洲所負之責任，以及美國協助復興歐洲之範圍等，東亞戰事亦將在會中討論之。倫敦相信斯達林急欲知此次戰事至何時始能結束。</p>
<h3>柏林各報論稱　戰局重大化　德軍已撤離華沙廢墟</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國社訊，德軍發言人昨晚宣稱：德軍在維斯杜拉河與那萊夫河之間進行解脫，業於星期三撤離華沙廢墟。德軍之撤退，係依照計劃進行，並未受蘇軍所阻，德軍新陣地業已加强兩面側翼，蘇軍企圖自南方包抄，必歸失敗。又稱：華沙北面之蘇軍，星期二以步兵四十師及坦克車數隊發動攻擊，曾向西深度突入，但德守軍在摩特林阻遏蘇軍之衝擊部隊，蘇軍多季攻勢之目標，不僅西進，同時且向西南及西北兩方推進。</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國各報十七日皆著論，率直指謫東綫戰局之重大化，人民觀察報載稱：蘇軍開始進攻時所獲巴拉諾夫地區廣大地域，其所投入之龐大兵力，已足實證現在德軍之任務，乃在後方設立新防綫，封閉蘇軍之突破口，德元首行營戰報稱，德軍雖正努力於此種任務，然尙未完成。</p>

<h3>蘇北旅滬同鄕　歡迎孫良誠將軍　滿腔熱忱一致期待解陰人民痛苦</h3>
<p>自國民政府任命孫良誠將軍爲蘇北綏靖主任後，孫將軍即率領所部駐防蘇北各縣，並設主任公署於揚州。日昨孫氏因事來滬，揚州七邑，江淮，通如崇海啓等三同鄉會旅滬代表爲表示歡迎敬意，於昨日中午假座華懋公庽聯合公宴，孫主任偕同二十六師師長陳才福，費邦蘇北運絡部長佃大佐等準時蒞會，同鄉會代表到有顧南羣，焦鼎鎧，朱德軒，劉振球，朱楚良，錢樹聲，朱九鄉，沈西賓，金學高等八十餘人。濟濟一堂，倍形親熱。</p>
<p>顧南羣詞</p>
<p>席間，首由通如崇海啓五縣同鄉會理事長顧南羣致歡迎詞，略謂：「孫將軍是西北軍名將，向以紀律嚴明，愛護人民著稱於時，在中國軍隊中軍譽最佳。此次從河南移駐蘇北，我蘇北十五縣民衆，頗感欣緻。因爲事變以後，蘇北各地駐軍龐雜，民衆已有疲於奔命之苦。現在孫將軍率部接防，則蘇北民衆過去所受之痛苦，可以從此解除。其次，從地方政治而言，誠是苛捐雜稅，名目繁多，人民負担重重，無喘息機會。所以，人民極盼得到賢明長官，在軍事政治兩方面，同時整飭。不過，高級長官雖有心求治，而中下級執行不力，民衆受苦，長官仍有不知。此種情形亦爲歷來事實，今後務盼注意。現在中央委派孫將軍駐簡蘇北，憑其過去治軍嚴明之信譽，必能拯救蘇北人民於水深火熱之中。陳才福師長更是我們蘇北同鄉，爲桑梓服務，必龍輔佐孫主任，以收駕輕就熱之效。」旋住揚州七邑同鄉會代表焦鼎鎧，江淮同鄉會代表朱德軒相繼致歡迎詞，熟烈希望孫主任爲蘇北人民解除痛苦。</p>
<p>孫良誠詞</p>
<p>嗣孫良誠將軍繼起答詞，略謂：今天承蘇北旅滬同鄉然君盛大招待，非常榮幸與快慰，同時又極漸愧。快慰者，能與諸位地方父老在此晤聚。慚愧者，自維材輇任重，誠恐無以担負軍政重責，有負國家付託之重與地方父老期望之般，但當遵從中央合令，本個人良心，努力向前做去。蘇北各地久爲新四軍所摧殘，以及其他少數無聯隊伍騷擾，今後自當運用力量掃蕩新四軍，並整理雜色隊伍。諸葛武侯所謂「鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已」，本人當亦以此爲決心。同時，盼望地方父老盡力協助。最後並由陳才福師長致詞，詞畢聚餐，直至下午二時半盡歡而散。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Encouraging General Sun Liangcheng</h3>
<p>Last October, the National Government officially ordered Xiang Zhizhuang, the Director of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification, to be transferred to the Governor of Zhejiang Province, and Sun Liangcheng, the Director of the Kaifeng Pacification, to take over as the Director of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification. Director Sun immediately led his troops to garrison Northern Jiangsu and assumed office. Sun recently came to Shanghai on business. Various Northern Jiangsu native associations in Shanghai held a joint banquet yesterday to welcome Sun, which was quite warm.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu was originally part of Jiangsu Province, located north of the Yangtze River. The administrative system was originally under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. In recent years, for practical convenience, an independent military and political area of Northern Jiangsu has formed. On October 31st last year, the Executive Yuan, in accordance with the provisions of the second item of the Provisional Outline for the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Director's Office to Concurrently Manage Northern Jiangsu Administrative Affairs, designated Taixian, Dongtai, Yancheng, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Baoying, Yizheng, Taixing, Jingjiang, Rugao, Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Gaoning as the 15 counties of the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Region. The Director of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification is the actual military and political leader of the 15 counties of Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The various counties of Northern Jiangsu are economically prosperous areas. Since the New Fourth Army's Southern Anhui Incident, they have fled to the Northern Jiangsu area. Over the years, they have expanded their power, won over the people, and permeated the entire Northern Jiangsu region. The original local miscellaneous troops are even more colorful and complex. Under the state of tug-of-war of mutual elimination and fear, the people in various places are exhausted and suffering immensely. For example, if the demands of the troops are hesitant and not allowed, then punishment will immediately follow. In the morning, Troop A arrives and harasses the area, and in the evening, Troop B comes and searches the area. Serving Troop A makes Troop B dissatisfied, and serving Troop B makes Troop A think you are protecting the other side. The ones bearing the brunt are the law-abiding old people, who are supporting these people. Slightly wealthier people are even more the targets of public criticism. Therefore, they cannot sleep peacefully at night, and some hide in ditches and fortresses, while others live in straw sheds. Their homes are emptied, and they must still offer compliments with a smile. The so-called discipline has disappeared, and the so-called not taking a single hair becomes taking every hair, with no one spared. Therefore, among the people of Northern Jiangsu, the mention of people in uniform evokes deep hatred.</p>
<p>Now that General Sun Liangcheng is in charge of the military and political affairs of Northern Jiangsu, with General Sun's past reputation in the Northwest Army, with strict discipline and not taking a single hair, we believe that he will be able to maintain his past reputation and relieve the suffering of the people of Northern Jiangsu. As Sun said at the Northern Jiangsu fellow villagers' welcome banquet: "Northern Jiangsu has long been ravaged by the New Fourth Army and harassed by other small and worthless troops. In the future, we will use our strength to eliminate the New Fourth Army and reorganize the miscellaneous troops." Sun also quoted Zhuge Wuhou's determination to "devote himself to the task until his death." We believe that the people of Northern Jiangsu have had the opportunity of "things will get better after they get worse" and can breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>However, while discipline is important in governing the army to avoid disturbing the people, it is still inevitably passive. On the active side, the responsibility of ensuring security should be undertaken. Ensuring security, in the current practical work, is to eliminate the New Fourth Army and reorganize the miscellaneous troops. From an objective point of view, the miscellaneous troops are originally a rabble, without training or knowledge, and are easy to reorganize. The New Fourth Army has disturbed the people in the past, but they can take advantage of various opportunities to seize the hearts of the people. Therefore, it is undeniable that in the people's impression, the miscellaneous troops are not as good as the New Fourth Army. This is a problem that deserves attention. Therefore, we believe that the situation in Northern Jiangsu is particularly complex. Governing Northern Jiangsu requires not only military but also political emphasis. In the military aspect, courage is needed, but also wisdom. Only with both wisdom and courage can one cope with the complex situation and win the hearts of the people. We hope that Director Sun will pay attention to talents who are both wise and courageous at all times.</p>
<p>Finally, the spirit of "devoting oneself to the task until death" is still an honorable failure in modern eyes. We hope that General Sun will go further and do his best to succeed and then rest.</p>
<h3>Road Administration Plans to Improve Railway Traffic Management; Three Measures Under Review</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – Recently, railway traffic management in Central China has been extremely corrupt, leading to the discovery of black market ticket transactions, frequent theft of passengers' luggage, and illegal extortion by black hats at railway stations, which greatly hinders legitimate passenger traffic. In view of this, the Road Administration of the Ministry of Construction convened an emergency meeting in Shanghai a dozen days ago, with the participation of the China Railway Company and other relevant organs, to discuss effective countermeasures. As a result, the China Railway Company was instructed to propose three effective measures and submit them to the Ministry for approval and implementation. The Ministry of Construction is closely reviewing the measures and coordinating with relevant organs to make a decision. According to reporters, the three measures are: (1) How to eliminate black market ticket transactions, (2) How to prevent theft of passengers' luggage, (3) How to crack down on illegal extortion by black hats at railway stations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attaché Leaves Tangier</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuters quoted a London dispatch that British Foreign Secretary Eden reported to the Lower House yesterday on the situation in Tangier, saying that the Japanese military attaché had left Tangier.</p>
<h3>U.S. Airman Discusses the Conflict Between the Kuomintang and the Communists</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch: Democratic Congressman Mansfield recently went to Chongqing as a special envoy of the President to inspect the political and economic situation. He has now returned to the United States. On the 16th, at a closed-door meeting of the House of Representatives, he issued a report as follows: Both the Kuomintang and the Yan'an regime are more concerned about the preservation of their own parties than about "resisting Japan." The general public is increasingly fearful of the Kuomintang because of the attitude of the troops and tax collectors. Although the Kuomintang claims democracy, it actually engages in dictatorial actions. In addition, the Yan'an regime is not only poorly informed about foreign affairs but also possesses its own troops, claiming to save the country. Although they are trying to find solutions to various internal problems in Chongqing, if they cannot stop this conflict and internal strife occurs, they will be subjected to interference by a certain major power.</p>
<h3>U.S. National Service Law Opposed by All Sectors</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Washington dispatch: President Roosevelt submitted a special message to Congress on the 17th, requesting the swift implementation of the National Service Law. However, Congress and various political and financial circles are strongly opposing it. The future of the National Service Law is difficult. The labor community is even more opposed to the National Service Law. The American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the two major labor groups in the United States, have expressed their absolute opposition because the National Service Law affects the freedom of the labor community. If the bill is introduced in Congress, a strong opposition movement will inevitably unfold. At the same time, the financial community has not expressed goodwill towards the National Service Law. The National Association of Manufacturers, the representative organ of the industrial community, issued a statement opposing it on the morning of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Date and Location of British, American, and Soviet Summit Determined</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, the date and location of the summit of the three major powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were determined on the 16th. Roosevelt will depart from Washington soon to attend the summit.</p>
<p>Berlin, 78th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency quoted a telegram from the Exchange Telegraph Company stating that at the upcoming Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin conference, President Roosevelt will request that certain base areas in the Pacific be redistributed under a trusteeship system.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reported that according to U.S. sources, the organization of the British, American, and Soviet summit is a difficult task for the countries involved. According to the New York correspondent of the Swedish Daily, if the United States insists on sending 48 representatives to the conference (one representative from each state), then Moscow will also want to send 18 representatives, that is, one representative from each Soviet republic. All parties are paying more attention to Senator Winton Benton's proposal to establish a four-nation alliance to maintain peace. President Roosevelt may submit the plan for discussion at the three-nation conference, but Communist leader Blot has expressed opposition. In a speech in New York, he said that the plan is to prevent the spread of communism in Europe. This attitude is likely to be instructed by Moscow, so Washington political circles are deeply worried. London believes that the return of Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Gusev to his country is a sign that the three-nation conference has more definite principles. Military and political issues will occupy equal positions in the conference. Regarding the Polish issue, Stalin hopes that other countries will express their attitude towards Lublin. He is more willing to guarantee that Mikołajczyk and other Polish leaders in London will return to Poland without interference. The post-war foreign policy of the United States will be the most important issue. Stalin will raise some difficult questions to Roosevelt, such as the period of time the U.S. military will remain in Europe, the responsibility of the United States to Europe after the war, and the scope of U.S. assistance to the reconstruction of Europe. The East Asian war will also be discussed at the meeting. London believes that Stalin is eager to know when this war will end.</p>
<h3>Berlin Newspapers Comment: The War Situation Becomes Critical: German Forces Have Withdrawn from the Ruins of Warsaw</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A German news agency reports that a German military spokesperson announced last night: German forces are disengaging between the Vistula and Narew Rivers, and completed the withdrawal from the ruins of Warsaw on Wednesday. The German withdrawal is proceeding according to plan and was not hindered by Soviet forces. The new German lines have been strengthened on both flanks, and any Soviet attempts at encirclement from the south are doomed to fail. The spokesman further stated that Soviet forces north of Warsaw launched an attack on Tuesday with forty infantry divisions and several tank units, penetrating deeply westward. However, German defending forces at Modlin are holding back the Soviet assault. The Soviet multi-pronged offensive aims not only westward but also southwest and northwest.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German newspapers on the 17th unanimously published commentaries frankly pointing out the critical nature of the Eastern Front situation. The "People's Observer" stated that the vast territory acquired by Soviet forces at the start of the offensive in the Baranow region, and the massive forces deployed, clearly demonstrate that the German mission now is to establish new defensive lines in the rear and seal the Soviet breakthroughs. A German Supreme Headquarters communiqué stated that while German forces are striving to achieve this mission, it is not yet complete.</p>

According to frontline reports, Soviet forces advancing south along the Vistula River began shelling German positions outside Krakow on the 17th.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German military announced on the 17th that Soviet forces are massing for a large-scale offensive, and the local situation in the Vistula River bend is not optimistic.

<h3>Fellow Subei Provincials in Shanghai Welcome General Sun Liangcheng; Ardent Hopes Expressed to Relieve the Suffering of the People</h3>
<p>Since the National Government appointed General Sun Liangcheng as Pacification Commissioner of Subei, General Sun has led his troops to garrison various counties in Subei and established the Commissioner's Office in Yangzhou. Yesterday, Sun came to Shanghai on business. Representatives of the Yangzhou Seven Counties, Jianghuai, and Tongru Chonghaiqi Associations in Shanghai held a joint banquet in his honor at the Cathay Mansion at noon. Commissioner Sun, accompanied by Chen Caifu, Commander of the 26th Division, Fei Bang, Subei Liaison Minister, and Lieutenant Colonel Tenant, attended the meeting on time. More than 80 representatives of the fellow provincial associations, including Gu Nanqun, Jiao Dingkai, Zhu Dexuan, Liu Zhenqiu, Zhu Chuliang, Qian Shusheng, Zhu Jiuxiang, Shen Xibin, and Jin Xuegao, were present. The atmosphere was warm and friendly.</p>
<p>Speech by Gu Nanqun</p>
<p>During the banquet, Gu Nanqun, Chairman of the Tongru Chonghaiqi Five Counties Fellow Provincial Association, delivered a welcoming speech, stating: "General Sun is a famous general of the Northwest Army, known for his strict discipline and care for the people. He has the best military reputation in the Chinese army. His transfer from Henan to Subei is greatly appreciated by the people of the fifteen counties of Subei because, after the Incident, various troops stationed in Subei were numerous and disorganized, causing much hardship to the people. Now that General Sun has taken over the defense with his troops, the past suffering of the people of Subei can be relieved. Secondly, in terms of local politics, there are numerous exorbitant taxes and levies, imposing a heavy burden on the people and leaving them no respite. Therefore, the people desperately hope to have a virtuous official who can rectify both military and political affairs. However, even if senior officials have the will to govern, if the middle and lower ranks do not implement policies effectively, the people will suffer, and the senior officials will remain unaware. This has been the case throughout history, and we hope that this will be taken into consideration in the future. Now that the Central Government has appointed General Sun to be stationed in Subei, we believe that based on his past reputation for strict military discipline, he will be able to save the people of Subei from their dire straits. Commander Chen Caifu is also a fellow provincial from Subei, and by serving his hometown, he will certainly assist Director Sun and achieve quick results." Subsequently, Jiao Dingkai, a representative of the Yangzhou Seven Counties Fellow Provincial Association, and Zhu Dexuan, a representative of the Jianghuai Fellow Provincial Association, delivered welcoming speeches in succession, passionately hoping that Director Sun would relieve the suffering of the people of Subei.</p>
<p>Speech by Sun Liangcheng</p>
<p>General Sun Liangcheng then gave a reply, saying: "I am very honored and gratified to receive such a grand reception from the fellow provincials in Shanghai today. At the same time, I am also very ashamed because I am afraid that I am not capable enough to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of military and political affairs, and I may fail to live up to the heavy trust placed in me by the state and the expectations of the local elders. However, I will abide by the orders of the Central Government, act according to my conscience, and strive to move forward. Subei has long been devastated by the New Fourth Army and harassed by other unorganized troops. In the future, I will certainly use my strength to eliminate the New Fourth Army and reorganize the miscellaneous troops. As Zhuge Liang said, 'I will dedicate myself to the task until my dying day,' I will also take this as my determination. At the same time, I hope that the local elders will do their best to assist me." Finally, Commander Chen Caifu gave a speech. After the speeches, a meal was held, and the event ended happily at 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>Readers Helping Students News</p>
<h3>Health Examination Report: Most Children Are Malnourished</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Gu Nanqun, Director of Nanyang Hospital, reporting the results of health examinations for students assisted by the Shen Xin and Xin Bao elementary school groups. The original letter stated: "In order to serve the community and emphasize the importance of impoverished students, our hospital, with the assistance of your newspaper, has been providing free health examinations for students supported by the Shen Xin and Xin Bao student aid funds. The examinations have been progressing smoothly for several months, and we are very pleased. The number of students examined totals 1,850, and 810 of them are malnourished. Other students suffering from various diseases requiring urgent treatment will be listed separately in a percentage table and sent for your review." According to the attached table, of these 1,850 students, 32% suffer from trachoma, 13.5% have enlarged tonsils, 12% have tuberculosis, and more than ten other localized diseases are not serious. Only 18% are normal, while 44% are malnourished, almost half of the total. At a time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood is as valuable as cinnamon, and the price of everything is high, malnutrition is to be expected. According to the general public, this is a very ordinary and unremarkable matter, but in fact, it is a serious problem for society as a whole. The most useful people in the country are often the energetic youth and the innocent children. Today, among the general student population, the impoverished account for 80-90%, and nearly half of them are malnourished, which can easily lead to incomplete development. This is a matter of great importance to the health of the nation! To take a step back, while it is naturally difficult to supplement their nutrition in these times of hardship, we can still find ways to help them avoid dropping out of school. Donating to this newspaper's reader assistance fund is a shortcut!</p>
<p>Advocating for a One-Yuan Bill Student Aid Campaign</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. Chen Shao states: "Your newspaper's efforts to raise student aid funds, help impoverished students, and benefit society are not only admirable but also deeply appreciated by society. In the name of the 'Everlasting Property Team,' I am sending 20,000 yuan. I am also suggesting that, with the rising prices of goods, the one-yuan and small-denomination bills issued by the Central Reserve Bank are almost useless. No one is willing to accept them, and they are often discarded, which is a pity. Why not place a small box at the entrance or by the wall of your newspaper, allowing people to drop in these small bills? After accumulating a certain amount, you can exchange them for larger bills at the Central Bank and use them for charitable purposes. The amount collected may be considerable. Is this feasible? Please consider it."</p>
<p>United Bank to Sell Tickets on Behalf</p>
<p>This newspaper and the News Daily, together with the Kuggan Theater Troupe, are staging two charity performances of "Autumn Begonia" at the Lyceum Theatre. The proceeds will be donated to student aid funds. The performances are scheduled for 7:30 PM on the 21st and 22nd. The best seats are being sold as "Honor Tickets" for 5,000 and 10,000 yuan. The authorities of the Shen Xin and Xin Bao newspapers have sent letters to enthusiastic and influential people in the industrial and commercial sectors to help promote sales. Other ordinary tickets for 500 and 1,000 yuan are being sold at the Lyceum Theatre, and the United Bank is also kindly assisting by selling tickets. Please reserve seats at the United Bank Head Office at 151 Beijing Road and the branch office at 624 Jing'an Temple Road. Don't miss the opportunity to enjoy a famous play.</p>
<p>Photographic Charity Exhibition Raises Funds for Student Aid</p>
<p>A letter from Huang Xiaoding, a student at the Shanghai Fine Arts School, states: "I am writing to inform you that I held a photographic charity exhibition and sold 62 photographs, receiving 514,000 Central Reserve Bank notes. After deducting the cost of materials and all expenses, there is a remaining balance of 187,460 yuan. Several other people have donated an additional 12,540 yuan, bringing the total to 200,000 yuan. We will donate 100,000 yuan each to the Shen Xin and Xin Bao newspapers specifically for student aid. I am sending a China Banking Corporation check for 100,000 yuan. Please acknowledge receipt."</p>
