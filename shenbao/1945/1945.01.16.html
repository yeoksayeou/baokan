<p>瑞典京城十五日中央社電據德國社訊：「阿夫通鐵寗報」紐約來電，引最近美方來自菲律賓之消息，美軍在呂宋島，現正遭遇日軍堅强之抵抗。該報續稱，戰事情形已更趨嚴重，各地區均有日軍强力進攻之消息。</p>
<p>呂宋島敵美軍補給路受威脅</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　呂宋島敵美選定之仁牙因灣登陸地點，曾爲日軍本間稚靜中將攻略菲律賓時，日單主力登陸之歷史地，其海濱近岸處概屬淺水，故具備最適宜登陸之條件。自戰略上觀，仁牙因至馬尼刺之問，爲中部呂宋平原，可自由活動機械化部隊，自仁牙因至馬尼刺爲二百五十公里，有平坦之公路可通，以普通汽車僅二小時可達。回顧菲律賓之當時敵美呂宋島最髙指揮官哥賴特少將，分布其兵力於自聖凡南多至仁牙因灣一帶，以二十一師布防於自達古旁至仁牙因，以三十一師布防於札西布來斯至亦巴附近，以五十一師布防於巴打雁南海岸，而馬尼刺附近更配置美菲一混成師。日軍登陸前更自比薩牙羣島增援的三師，配置於第十一，第二十一師之下，故當時與日本登陸軍於仁牙因一帶交戰者，爲第十一，第二十一兩師及自比蔬牙羣島增援之第七十一，第九十一兩師，以及特種部隊一師，共爲五師。日登陸軍與敵騎兵戰車隊激戰不久，即將此五師團殲滅，向馬尼刺作怒濤之進擊，故此次敵軍於菲律賓登陸，亦可謂效法日軍之故智。其堪注目者，爲敵軍至登陸地點之補給路，係自斯麻髙海峽經民答那峨海，游魯海等海峽，迴航呂宋西岸達一千五百公里之航程，以船團平常速度爲十五哩計，最少仍須時兩晝夜，即快速之護衛艦，其速度爲二十哩者，仍須四十三小時以上。敵軍所選之登陸地點之補給路，於沿途更有不斷遭受日航空隊及潛艇隊威脅之可能性，敵軍作戰指導部，當然極爲熟識此點也。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c3">讀周市長吿市民書後 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>周市長以次各新任市政長官，已於昨日就職視事，周市長並發表吿市民書曁就職訓詞。羅秘書長也發表談話。從這幾篇文字中，我們可以觀察今後本市施政的方向。我們讀了周市長吿市民書後，也有若干感想，願就敎於市畏並與市民諸君共商榷之。　第一，市長吿市民書第一段說：「……我最好的朋友以及友邦的知好，都勸我不要幹，他們都本着愛護我的熱忱，不願使我到上海來犧牲。他們以爲上海的情形，今後祗有越加困難，越加惡劣，任何人來都不會有辦法。……」誠然，上海的情形確實困難，上海的環境確實惡劣；所以，這一副擔子確實是相當重的。自從汪故主席逝世，陳前市長繼主中樞，出任代理主席以後，無暇兼任本市市長，我們環顧情勢，就想這一副重擔，應由周佛海先生挑起了。可是，經過了一個多月。中央還不發表市長人選，猶豫未決，我們很爲焦急。去年十二月二十五日本報社評中，指出上海地位的重要，希望從速決定發表。所以，我們的意見適與周氏的知好相反，我們的意思，似乎不是周氏最好的朋友的意思了。可是，後來事實證明，還是周氏挑起這副副重擔。我們在本年一月四日的社評中已經表示十二分的欣幸。</p>
<p>第二，吿市民書第二段說：「……我希望大家對我不要有什麽期待，沒有期待，將來不會失望，期望越大，將來的失望就越甚，我不願意大家將來失望，所以請大家現在不必期待。……」這些一話，我們認爲是周氏自謙之詞。我們當然有期待，而決不致失望。因爲上海的環境固然惡劣，而並非沒有辦法的。周市長提出向市民保證兩點：（一）我們本着苦幹實幹硬幹的精神去做。不敷衍，不因循，不茍安，不辭勞怨，不打官腔，切切實實的埋頭苦幹，盡最大的可能，爲市民謀福利。（二）我和我的幹部都是壯年有爲的，我們的精神是公益重於私利，社會先於個人，不會利用職權和地位，去謀個人的私利私益。本着陳代主席樹立廉潔政治的精神，以身作則，不貪汚，不枉法，不舞幣營私，不巧取豪奪，切切實實清査整頓，盡最大的可能，爲市民减少痛苦。只就這兩點保證，已經符合市民的期待，祇須貫澈保證，就決不會失望了。</p>
<p>第三，吿市民書中又提示「治亂世，用重典」的原則，對於貪官奸商爲非作歹的惡類敗類，決不姑息寬容，査獲確實證據，予以嚴厲處分。「治亂世，用重典，」過去我們曾一再主張。可是，上海雖是萬惡之區，謠言這樣的多。囤積投機，操縱物價又這樣的巧妙。可惜沒有用過重典，所以，爲非作歹，愈演愈烈。我們希望今後貫澈重典主張，尤其是剷除暴利，以全副力量抑平物價，這就是减少市民痛苦與謀取市民福利。這樣，我們也可以保證，市民的協力是絕無問題的。</p>
<p>其次，周市長的就職訓詞，雖對公務人員而言，不過，就勗勉克盡職守一點，在我們市民也應同樣的注意。舉例而言，如保甲制度中，每個市民都有規定任務，必須大家克盡職守，發揮保甲的最髙效能。</p>
<p>最後，我們建議，也是我們向所主張，上海問題的解決，必須有一個核心的力量去推動，這個核心的結成，是市府與民間，以及盟邦各關係機關，三方面的力量，相互協力，凝結成一個核心。願中日當局以及民間領袖共起圖之。</p>
<p>羅秘書長昨天談話中提出三點，因限於篇幅，容明日申論之。</p>
<h3 id="c4">周市長兼保安司令　發表就職訓詞 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>滬市周市長兼保安司令昨發表就職訓詞如次：「這次受命於危疑震撼之秋，深深的感覺到責任的重大，環境的困難，和個人能力的薄弱，所以深深的恐懼着不能完成政府所授的使命，不能實現中外各界人士的期望　，今後個人當竭盡聰明才力，爲上海市民而助務，希望本府本部全體文武同仁，各盡最大的努力。上海市政經陳前市長的經營，已奠定了堅强的基礎和根本大計，本人今後祗在已定的基礎上面，照着已定的計劃，逐步求其實施和完成，沒有甚麼新的方針和計劃，不過有幾點想在今天就職和本府本部職員初次見面的時候，提出來說一說。</p>
<p>各盡職守</p>
<p>第一，希望大家要各盡職守。這句話好像是老生常談，但是過去無論甚麽機關，無諭甚麼人員，老實說都沒有完全做到。我們要知道我們所能効忠國家，服務社會的，不必好高騖遠，只要能够各盡職守就行了。國家和社會之所需要我們的，也不過祗是各盡職責，如果全國的公務人員都能各職職守，國家早已強盛起來，那裏會像今天這樣支離破碎。希望本府本部的公務人員，要把自已所擔任的職務，當做自己的事，不要玩忽，不要懈怠，不要敷衍，如果上面不督促，就不去努力，甚至於就是受了督促，還是陽奉陰違，事業固然不能推進，個人食了國家的俸祿，受了人民的瞻養，也對不起國家和人民，所以要希望大家要本起良心，忠實於職守。</p>
<p>勿謀私利</p>
<p>第二，希望大家不要利用職權去謀私利。國家社會之所以需要我們，是要我們爲國家做事業，爲人民謀福利，如果我們利用權力和地位，去做害國殃民的事，不僅是法律不能寬恕，道德也不能容許的。上海道個地方經英美帝國主義百年的統治，已成了萬惡的都市，環境太劣，引誘太多，大家要持躬淸正，不受環境的誘惑，固然也不是一件容易的事，但是我們要刻苦，要堅忍，要以道德的精神力量，克服物質的誘惑，損國家害人民的行爲，自巳的良心也是不容許的。今後如果發覺有假公濟私的舞弊情事，本人必以法律作嚴厲的處分，希望各人道德良心上，也要自覺自制</p>
<p>提高待遇</p>
<p>第三，盡可能的限度內提髙公務員的待遇。對於公務人員我們要求其克盡職守，我們要求其不假公濟私，但是他們的最低生活，我們務必盡可能使其得到維持。上海市公務人員的待遇，曾經陳前市長一再提髙，公務人員的生活，賴以稍得安定，不過物價上漲太快，目前又成了問題。現在打算對於公務人員及軍警的待遇，再行提高，不過上海市的財政，已陷於收支不能相抵的狀態，如果待過提高，支出又要增加，收支相差更要加多。我又不願使人民負擔一時加得太重，所以想從整理稅收剔除中飽等方式着手，務必在財力許可的限度內，提髙待遇，不過，在作戰時期，任何國家的官吏和人民生活，都是勞苦的，政府固然要盡力之可能提髙待遇，同時希望大家不要忘記現在是戰時，也要盡可能的忍受生活時困苦。</p>
<p>人事問題</p>
<p>第四，對於人事問題也要說一說。我沒有意思安置私人，也沒有私人需要安置，所以對於本府本部的人員，是不會隨便更動的，但是我要做事，而且要把事做好，要做事要把事做好，就需要能力好品行好的人，所以只要是有能力有品行的人，大家都可以安心，決不會更動的。至於怎樣判別有無能力和品行，當然以客觀的考察來斷定，決不會憑主觀的喜怒好惡爲標準，我個人如此，我的幹部也如此，這一事大家都可以放心。今天乘就職的機會簡單的發表自己要說的話，今後困難的問題很多，要解決這些問題，都是不容易的事，只有盡最大的努力，一步一步的切實做去，得失不計，毀譽不顧，勞怨不辭，至於是非曲直，只有讓社會以公正的眼光來判斷了。」</p>
<h3 id="c5">敵美殘餘艦隊　將遭受撲滅　日海軍專家談菲島戰局 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>呂宋島戰事，日趨激化，頃據上海盟邦海軍專家分析該島戰局，略謂：</p>
<p>呂宋平原將有大戰</p>
<p>敵方在仁牙因灣及聖法比安登陸部隊，其兵力有兩師團，另一部份爲戰車隊。敵第二第三船團，已抵仁牙因灣附近，但似未登陸。菲島日本守軍現正在岸邊撲減登陸敵軍，菲島日軍指揮官山下及大賀兩將軍已在離仁牙因海岸較遠處之阿古諾河一帶，佈置陣地，在呂宋島中原，與敵作野戰，日美兩方之大戰即將在該處展開。目下敵方一部份航空隊雖稍爲有利，但尙未遭遇日本所得意之野戰，蓋中部地方平原，爲敵方大砲射程所不及，日軍便於發揮巧妙戰術也。麥克沃塞軍隊能否應付此最精銳之野戰，洵屬問題。同時，日軍將在該處對敵軍作最大之消耗戰，尤其是呂宋島現値乾燥季節，適宜於野戰。日本國內對於飛機又加緊生產，源源飛往前方接濟，加强作戰之力量。</p>
<p>日本艦隊準備完成</p>
<p>敵美資艦隊，今後在菲島及台灣東方海面，將出以何項舉動，頗堪注目。敵方在台菲海面，聚集兵力，澳洲艦隊及英國太平洋艦隊亦出動，其海軍力量自不可輕視，但尼米資艦隊今後之動向，容有相當變化。而日本聯合艦隊業已完成作戰準備，對尼米資艦隊之活動，正嚴密加以監視中，故太平洋方面，亦將發生大海戰。至於英國印度洋艦隊在蘇門答臘附近出現，係牽制戰性質，並無其他作用。要之，此一海戰與陸戰，乃爲決定大東亞戰爭之決戰，在作戰中，美國有兩大弱點：</p>
<p>敵美暴兩大弱點</p>
<p>（一）補給路綫之不完備，尤其是燃料不足，爲最大原因。</p>
<p>（二）兵力之不足。據麥克沃塞宣稱，菲島作戰，已用去兵力二十萬。目下新幾內亞方面，敵方已無兵力，故欲在他處作戰，其兵力何目而來，實成問題，尤其是呂宋島平原作戰，如何負擔，更成問題。此在日本方面，則並無上項缺點，日本海軍將兵現正準備將前次作戰時敵美所有殘餘艦隊，一舉予以撲滅。</p>
<p>美國國內形勢不安</p>
<p>目下美國國內，甚爲不安，羅斯福雖四次速任總統，但國內則到處發生暴動，故美軍在菲島登陸，爲羅斯福對國內有利的　傳，藉以鎭壓暴動。但自地理上觀之，美國長途跋涉，遠侵菲島，其消耗之巨，自屬驚人，其國內隱患無窮。美國現雖揚言努力飛機生產，但因勞動力不足，故困難重重，絕難達到增產目的。</p>
<p>登陸敵軍苦戰情形</p>
<p>（中央社滬訊）去歲十月開始之美軍菲島登陸作戰，自此次在呂宋島登陸後，猛烈程度已達最高潮。該時期內美軍雖遭遇歷史上空前之大流血，然仍反覆增强兵力，不惜一切犧牲，以國家命運作孤注一擲，挑起最後的大決戰。此次阻遏美軍進擊者，並非僅爲日軍勁旅之反擊，對此敵方自身亦有明白表示。茲將彼等對於呂宋島登陸作戰之苦戰情形，披露數端於次。</p>
<p>第一爲敵方已忘懷非島對美國之宣戰，在此兩年中，菲島人民已獨立爲大菲律賓共和國，負起建設大東亞共榮圈之一部份責任，毅然向美國宣戰，但極爲遺憾，此種事實未被美軍認淸，彼等認爲祇須在菲島登陸，則居民自會舉手表示歡迎，並予一切援助，然菲島人已不是美國的奴隸矣。</p>
<p>麥克沃塞司令部最近曾發表稱：呂宋島爲組織游擊隊，料想並不協助美軍而抵抗日軍，例如一隊相常多數之菲島人，現正協助日軍，担任日軍之間諜工作，活動頗力。游擊隊於解放呂宋島而言，頗見重要，但游擊隊時有通敵行爲，故組織游擊隊乃屬不可能者云。</p>
<p>第二點爲登陸作戰時船隻之不足，據海通社十二日斯德哥爾摩電報，美軍於呂宋島登陸時，不足船隻，係向反軸心諸國調來，關於此問題，英內長里却特巴啓程渡美。去秋反軸心原預料歐洲戰局可吿結束，但終於失敗。蓋在歐洲欲運輸一師兵力，以五萬噸船舶，的需時二星期，但同樣以一師兵力派往呂宋島，則需船二十萬噸，費時五個月。總之，彼等根據歐洲戰局將近結束的誤解而實施之四個月前作戰，在目今情勢下，已根木發生動搖，去秋魁北克會談時，彼等斟酌歐洲戰局而訂定之太平洋作戰船舶計劃，已吿失敗，致使作戰進行極感困難</p>

<p>張景惠氏談話</p>
<p>滿洲國國勢與時俱興，國際地位蒸蒸日上，在完遂大東亞戰爭上，已建下極大功勳。滿皇對於增强盟邦的戰力，頗爲關注，前爲節約鋼鐵資材起見，下令中止新宮殿的建造，近來更推行白金與金局的收回運動，將日常所用白金製品銅器及美術品等提供出來，率先示範於國民。張國務總理則以悠然不迫的氣度，號令國民，頗獲國民的信任。十二月二日記者（久住特拍員）往訪國務院時，承張總理賜見，並發宏論道：</p>
<p>「滿洲國必須克服一切因難，增加生產，協力盟邦。日滿兩國關係與其他共榮圈各國相異之點，正如皇帝陛下所宣布，生死存亡，斷不分離，即兩國猶如骨肉一般。這次戰爭，實足決定東亞的運命。倘若戰失敗，我們東洋人將成英美奴款，所以務須舊鬥；而我自己，則抱着此戰必勝的不動信念。滿洲國的責任，隨戰局的進展，益形重大。爲了保衛大東亞，必須集結全體國民的總力，在所有生產部門從事必死的鬥爭。」</p>
<p>編復談及特攻隊的事情，略謂：</p>
<p>「謂到神風特別攻擊隊，已在報上　到陸軍特攻隊的新聞，也聽到別人談過，實在不勝敬仰感佩。前幾日看到神風特攻隊出發的影片，當我看見那種喝酒而踏上征途的塲而時，不覺流下淚來，深感盟邦將士旣如此奮鬥，我滿洲國更非努力增產酬答不可。」</p>
<p>戰時滿洲的意氣，由張總理身上也可感覺到。</p>
<p>農業增產運動</p>
<p>今日是滿洲國農產物收集的最盛期。滿洲的農業，負着中日滿食糧需給的重大任務，農民供出的數量，年年增加，本年度更揭出空前的龐大收買目標。去歲今年（民國三十二。三十三兩年）都是近頃未見的大豐年。現在收穫工作正循新的計畫方針進行，全滿頗呈活發氣象，收集的數量已達目標的五成，正在充分發揮大東亞食糧源泉的威力。</p>
<p>滿政府現已擬定明年度的增產對策，決定增產目標爲：一般農民一成，開拓民五成。此外並爲改良農事起見，在農業團體研究所，農事試騐塲等的技術動員方面，也研究種種方策。又自本年度起，重點施行的開拓農地工事，亦着着進步，規模之大誇稱舉世無雙的第二松花江地區工事，爲其中心設施的第一揚水塲工事，業已依照預定，如期竣工。而北滿方面，利用結冰期的水路開鑿工事，亦在着着進行中，於零下三十餘度的酷寒中，不斷努力。</p>
<p>輕金屬業躍進</p>
<p>至於鑛工業部門，在勞務與機材上，對於急速發展的新興國家，問題在所不免，但現正克復重重困難，繼續奮鬥。過去鑛工業生產機材類全部仰給日德美與海外，今日則在迅速助成國內工作機械工業的發達之下，獎勵有效活用旣存機材及修理破損機材的對策，在可以稱爲最大撤結的機材之運用上，探索種種創造性的方法。</p>
<p>全滿埋藏頗富的煤炭生產現狀，特別是舊滿炭系的煤田，成績允有可觀。而三江省及通化省的某地等，頗有希望的新興煤田事業，也着着進展，來年度的增產目標，比本年度生產目標更高二成，已在準備進行中。</p>
<p>擔任戰時盟邦製鐵事業之一翼的滿洲鍊鋼事業，常本新的氣魄，講求增產對策。現在鞍山地區已成敵機轟炸的標的，但鋼鐵增產戰士和敵機力爭，爲絕對確保生產量而拼命奮鬥。至於輕金屬工業，也應「飛機越多越好」的戰局要求，鋁　的增產對策，均在積極研究中，前途極有希望</p>
<p>此外，鉏，鱗狀黑鉛，鎢，頁岩油等的增產，也在進展中而負起近代兵器資源之新使命而登塲的酒石酸石灰，則已總動員滿洲特產的山葡萄。他如酒精的增產，製造髙梁酒的燒鍋亦在滿系土着資本的協力下，更生活用。而滿洲東北部爲冰雪所封閉的樹海，已入冬山採伐的最盛期，努力緊急動員戰時木材資源。另一方面，運輸這些木材，農產物及冬季大量需要的煤的鐵路，也不顧補給困難等惡劣條件，展開決戰運轍的猛烈鬥爭。</p>
<p>勤勞奉公制度</p>
<p>從本年度起，到明年度止，在最可注目的問題中，決戰勞務動員勢態即其一端。迅速擴大强化的戰時產業，旣需極大的勞力，而從華北招募勞工，又因物價相差之故，簡直無望，結果，國內勞務需給狀况，特別是戰時產業所要的勞力，非在國內設法確保不可。對於此事，去年起實行的國民勤勞奉公制度，業已得到很好的效果。另一方面，日滿學生「勤勞奉公制」也與日本內地呼應，自九月末起，男女中等學校髙級生以上學生，適用通年動員，來年度將再擴大强化。</p>
<p>政府當局爲圖強化勞務對策，在十一月十五日國務院會議中通過「決戰勞務動員實施綱要」，決定自明年度起適用，至此始見樹立建國以來無需華北勞動力的勞力需給政策，而其骨架則爲根據整備勞動動員座帳簿而擬訂的動員計劃，以及刷新勞務管理，設定各種重要產業的勞務地盤等。</p>
<p>此外，鑑於勞務的緊急情勢，日關東軍方面已連續二次招用大量女子軍鹿，使原來工作於軍隊中的男子軍屬轉向重要產業部門，而政府方而亦實施政府特殊團體事務員之勤勞職塲動員，在運動員下首以政務廳爲基幹，將所屬未滿三十歲的日滿系職員一千名，全都送到飛機及鋼鐵的生產部門，由於政府方面的以身作則，民間亦釀成一種挺身於戰時產業的風氣。現在的滿洲國正緊隨着酷烈的戰局，愈益顯出她軒昂的氣槪，默身於各方面的各民族皆同心戳力，爲擊滅敵人英美而結成一體，共同向着勝利的前途奮進。（久住特派員）（譯自十二月十九日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c25">羅秘書長　發表施政重點　提出要點三項 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>上海特別市政府新任秘書長羅君强氏，昨（十五）日下午五时半在市府大厦会议廳，會同新任市府宣傳處長劉德煊，接見中日新聞記者製，發表市政府施政重點，幷介紹新任劉宣傳處長及市府總務科長曹公港。羅氏談話如下：「本人此次奉命參加上海市政府的工作，當本二十年來隨同新任市長周先生爲革命而共同奮鬥之決心，益加堅忍刻苦以邁進。周市長因所任各職，甚爲繁重，對於上海市長一職的兼任，屢向最高當局婉辭，終因種種關係，毅然肩此重任，對於大上海至前途，以及全體市民福利制關切，市長已予吿上海民眾一文及就職訓辭中，坦然詳述。至於今後本市政府施政的重點，謹遵陳行政院長及周市長之特別指示，簡略提出數項如次：</p>
<p>埋頭苦幹以身作則</p>
<p>（一）埋頭苦幹，以身作則。周市長此次就職之始，並不發表洋洋灑灑的施政宣言，實因周市長乃中樞負責要員之一，陳代主席秉承汪故主席遺志所揭藥推行之政策，即爲本市政府推行之政策，惟有循此基本政策，因地因時，各制其宜，以必要之手段，促其實現而已。今日爲公務員者，不分文武，不論階級，必須埋頭苦幹，以身作則，方能達成其使命。　整飭風紀，勵行廉潔政策，値兹大東亞戰爭巳達決戰階段之際，在上海市應從何處入手？第一，應該是整飭公務員及全般軍警的風紀，以實現廉潔政治，首先要保障官吏的最低限度的生活。今在戰時，生活本爲極簡單的問題，官吏的生活自然要受戰時應有的限制，公務機關中一部份不良及不必要的人員，自然也有淘汰的必要，唯勤勞奉公者，方能獲得相當地位，唯勤勞奉公者，才有主張生活之權，這不僅是市政的問題，也是今日一般政治上的要諦。享受相當限度的生活保障，仍然漠視戰時體制，爲非作歹之徒，自然只有斷然處置，畫法懲治之一法。</p>
<p>增加生產　協力戰爭</p>
<p>（二）增加生產，安定民生，並協力大東亞戰爭此點較諸以上兩項，困難更多，自須以最大努力行之，將一切人力物力，集中在生產上，始能安定市民生活，也就是恊定戰爭的積極設施。單就勞力問題來講，也和整飭官吏風紀一樣，須使利益歸於勤勞者，想不勞而獲得人，實無保護的必要。就生活物品的配給方面來講，也應增加生產，增進交易，以求生產量的絕對增加。關於這點，也當重視勤勞工作者，這樣生產即可增加，民生亦可安定，也就是在精神上和物質上恊力戰爭·又値此戰時，禁止浪費節約消費等積極的施政，亦當同時並進。總之，各種問題甚多，對於上下左右的聯絡，尤當努力，希望有關機關多多援助，合力推行各項事務，並希望上海市民全體及地方父老先進，勤加督責指敎，期能充分發揮上述施政，公私甚辛。」</p>
<h3 id="c26">警局新舊局長　舉行交替儀式　周兼局長勉爲光榮警察 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>市警察局新任兼局長周佛海氏，於昨（十五）日上午十一時在該局八樓會堂舉行同副局長蘇成德，盧英，主任孫理甫，暨各正副處長，正副科長，正副分局長以上全體高級警官百餘人恭迎下，周兼局長偕同市保安司令部參謀長熊劍東等準時蒞臨，在該局樂隊奏樂聲中，儀式即行開始，高唱國歌行禮如儀後，新舊任局長移交印信，由渡副局長代表陳前任局長交替印信，全體職員向新舊任局長行敬禮一鞠躬即由周兼局長致訓詞，詞畢，禮成奏樂，周兼局長至局長辦公室視事，分別接見各正副處長等高級警官，均訓勉有加。</p>
<p>警局人事略有更迭，計派滿其蔚代理總務處長，主任秘書孫理甫辭職照准，遺缺派司法處長李時雨兼代，行政處長呂琪辭職照准，派警防處長平岡勇兼代，又派洪德茂代理秘書（薦任）上該各處長等，均巳於昨日到局辦公。</p>
<p>周兼局長訓詞</p>
<p>「今天就任上海市警察局兼局長的職務，和警察局的同僚，初次見面，覺得非常愉快。</p>
<p>在民國二十九年國民政府還都的時候，設立了警政部，本人奉命担任第一任的警政部長，現在到上海來，又兼任警察局局長，個人和警察業務，有這樣深的緣，實在是始料所不及。</p>
<p>警察任務</p>
<p>警察的任務，對政府是負着推行政令的責任，對人民是負着保護安全的責任，所以政治是不是良好，人民能不能安居樂業，完全看警察能不能正當的執行其職務。如果警察不能正當的推行政令，反而利用種種法律命令，取舞弊營私，政治決不會淸明的，如果警察不能保護人民，反而利用續力去壓迫或剝削人民，人民決不會按了的。警察對於政府和人民，旣然負着這樣的廉潔自持，忠實護愼去執行任務，各位都有着專門的知識和經騐，用不着本人多說。</p>
<p>光榮警察</p>
<p>警察的任務是神聖的，所以警察和警士應該爲人民所愛戴，而不應該爲人民所厭惡，爲人民所愛戴，是光榮的警察，爲人民所厭惡的警察，乃是不名譽的警察。上海市每個警官和警士都要自己反省自己，究竟是爲市民所愛戴，或是市民所厭惡，自己究竟是光榮的警察，或是不名譽的警察。每個警官，每個警士，不穩時華籍或外籍，都要這樣自問，我們一定要得着市民的爱戴，一定要做光荣的警察。</p>
<p>今後設施</p>
<p>完成上海市的光榮警察，這是本人今後一切設施的根本。上海市的警察行政，經陳前兼局長的指導，巳經上了軌道，本人的任務，就是循着這個軌道，逐漸整理，逐漸充實，以完成上海市光榮警察的建設。</p>
<p>今後打算一方面在財力所許可的範圍之內，盡最大之可能，提高待遇，同時在各方設股期待之下，盡最大的努力，整飭網紀，希望全體警官和警士，都要自肅，都要自勉。」</p>

<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所，昨日下午循例舉行報道會議，席間松平報道部長述及美國自作戰以來物資日益缺乏，並提供下列各項消息，以爲佐證。部長更謂以美國國家而論，向來於物資方面不可不稱爲豐富，今日且有此現象，我滬地民眾宜如何撙節儉用，知所警惕矣。</p>
<p>關於美國最近之物資短少情形事實方面所透露者計有：　美軍在歐洲作戰，傷兵所需絆創制繃帶超過原定數量，據昨日電訊，其紅十字會首腦哈萊氏稱：三個月前預算需用繃帶而十萬萬捲之繃帶送往歐洲，以資應用云。　承平之時，美國所消耗之橡皮原料，百分之八十九係由馬來亞輸入，大東亞戰時起後，來源斷絕，因國內橡皮奇缺，民間已不能獲得此項物品之配給。　美國造紙業本極發達，坎拿大產紙尤多。目下則情形一變，紙量日少，除報紙雜誌之出版者方面尙可獲得用紙外，其他方面巳無紙可用，大規模之出版業乃多閉歇。　戰事發生後，製衣原料亦殊缺乏，目下爲節省衣料計，規定男子上裝不得用雙排紐扣，褲管之下端亦不得摺疊,女子則裙之長度及膝二至。去年美國人民一年間可得配給襪九雙，但其材料奇劣，較好之襪，須三十五人始可獲得一雙之配給量云。　美國烟草產量現亦大遜於昔，去夏起各地居民凡欲購買紙烟者，均須於一早在烟店前列隊等候（猶滬上之軋買香烟然），軍隊間因烟草配給量减少，兵士咸抱不滿云</p>
<p>關於物資缺乏之各種情形，美國向不發表，使人無從懸測，其實際情况如何，上述消息雖多屬一鱗半爪，跡及瑣碎，但舉一反三，美國之物資缺乏現象，巳殊普遍耳。</p>

<h3 id="c37">新年市聲　積極疏散本市人口 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— 雨順</p>
<p>疏散都市人口，爲戰時重要設施之一，反顧吾國第一大都市的上海，自事變以來，人口反較以往增加。過去市政當局，對此始終採取放任態度，差幸迄今尚未發生悲慘的後果。惟近來戰局緊張，上海人口實有積極加以疏散的必要：</p>
<p>疏散必要　（一）防空上的需要：際此決戰階段，戰事已趨激烈，雙力空　日益頻繁，如本市空前稠密的人口，再不從速　散，一旦遭遇轟炸，死傷必　，對於救濟難民，大感困難，去年十二月二十四日漢口市的慘劇，頗有再現於本市的可能，所以　預爲　而。</p>
<p>（二）經濟上的需要：本市市民日常必需品，除工業品能就地取給外，他如食物及燃料，無不須由數百里甚至數千里外運來。假定現留居於上海的市民，子啊各方面確需留居上海，則此種供養方式，尙有可說。惟查現今市民中，至少三分之以以上，殊無留居上海的必要。假使此三分之一以上的人口，疏散至食物出產地和燃料供給地，至少可以節省許多人力和物力，本市物價壓低。</p>
<p>（三）治安上的需要：本市自受動力限制和原料缺乏之影響，工商百業，頗受　矮。解雇員工，時有所聞，以是失業人數激增，彼等方被解雇，手中尙有　當數額的解雇費，倘不於此際，遺回鄉里，待過了相當時日，手中　盡，必弄劍回鄉旣不能，求生亦無法的絕境，對本市治安，殊有妨礙。故能於廢暦年關前後，疏散人口，最爲上策。</p>
<p>由此言之，市政當局爲本市前途計，應以積極疏散人口列爲本年度重要施政之一。</p>
<p>疏散方法　至於疏散方式，有強迫疏散和自動疏散兩種，各有利弊。惟在局勢尚未十分緊逼之時，似以自動疏散，比較利多弊少。其實本市全體市民中，確有相當人數，急於回鄉，但因交通困難，欲行且止。倘當局能予以督促，給以旅行上的幫助，他們一定願意立即回鄉的。在自動疏散期間，譬如說規定爲六個月，即可同時作強迫疏散的準備，像調查市民職業以作判定其去留的根據。</p>
<p>疏散人口的工作，似宜由社會福利局主其事，而以各旅滬同鄕會及各縣當局輔助，並希望警察交通機關予以協力。</p>
<p>疏散人口時，最難解決的問題，爲運輸問題。此必須獲得華中鐵道公司和上海內河輪船公司及其他內河輪船公司的合作。關於華中鐵道公司方面，希望該公司以回南京及杭州方面貨　空車，載運抵同一目的地的回鄉市民，例如規定某班第一節車至第五節車（倒數下同）專乘回常州者，到常州站即將此五節車放下，第十一節以前均專乘回南京者。關於內河輪船，希望各公司備「疏散客船」附拖於「正常客船」之後，使市民能由陸路反鄕外。又可由水道回里，如此刻增加疏散的速度。至於車船票價，最好能免收，否則亦須打一大折扣，藉以減輕回鄉市民的負擔，携帶行李，亦必須予以便利。</p>
<p>凡乘免費或減價車船的回鄉市民應先向各旅滬同鄕會取得籍貫證明書和回鄉證，在向社會福利局登記，無旅滬同鄕會者，向保甲長處取得籍貫證明書。然後由社會福利局根據登記的先後，分別通知回鄉日期及方法。</p>
<p>趨之，疏散市民固然不是一件簡單易辦的事情，但確是一件急於辦理的事情。希望市政當局能在手續便捷。費用節省，疏散迅速的原則下，制定縝密的疏散計劃，而即付諸實則。</p>

<p>— 張啓昆</p>
<p>學費之提高與失學青年之人數爲同方向之增加，此爲必然之事實，其後果之嚴重，晚近申新各報論述綦詳。茲就搶救失學之方法，提供管見如下：</p>
<p>（一）郵資附加　由敎育局咨請郵政管理局於信件包裹之遞送時，代收助學捐百分之五十（假設），其數區區，必不致影響郵政前途，而人民亦定樂從，其法無庸另發新郵票，祇須於郵票上加藍「助學捐已付」字樣印截即可。本法之實行，爲便利計，可僅以上海地區爲限，行之一月，其數必可觀，失學靑年必因而驟减。</p>
<p>（二）免費及半費畫學額敎局通令各校添置免費及半費學額各若干，（數額由敎局專會研究，視各校之經濟情况而定）。免費及半費生，以各校自行甄別爲原則但須受敎局之審核，以杜流弊，成績不著，或陽奉陰違者，視情節之輕重，予以警吿或其他之處分，反之，予以褒獎。</p>
<p>（三）鼓勵大中學生開設義校大中學生於課餘創立義校，滬上已數見不鮮。如更能稍加組織及鼓勵，收效與一般學校較，恐未必遜色，况對敎育之普及有益也。（移酬助學）</p>

<p>甲，學校方面（一）平時：一，上課時間：自上午八時三刻起，至下牛三時止。如此，則學生可於七時起身，下午回家後尙有數小時，可完畢當日功課。並不增加學生家庭開燈時間，故與節電無妨。二，休息日：每星期日爲休息日，餘日一律全日上課（此點已有數校實行。）</p>
<p>上列二點，在特別情形下之學校得以例外。</p>
<p>（二）警報發出時：一，警戒警報：繼續上課·二，空襲警報：立即停課，並由敎師率領學生至校中較安全之地方避難；此時學生應絕對服從師長命令。三，凡學生有不到者，不作缺席論，遲到亦然。</p>
<p>上列二點在訓驟警報下例外（第二第三）</p>
<p>乙學生方面；（一）平時：依校規而行。（二）警報發出時：一，警戒警報：未出發者，在家稍待至一刻後，若無他變，則上學。已出發而在途者繼續進行，已至校者在校上課。二，空襲警報：未出發者不必上學，在途者入避難所或親戚家，巳至校者從師命而行。</p>
<p>上列二點，在訓練警報下例外。</p>
<p>若警報發出在放學時：（一）由學校命令各學生，離家近者速回家，遠者留在校中，若近者而不顧回者亦留校中。（二）已在途而離校近者，回校或入近處避難所，親戚家。</p>
<p>此外，學校須訓練學生防空智識，尤須隨機應變。至於所曠之髁，則在星期日或假日補上。上述數點，不識學校當局以爲然吾？（朱良購）</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Philippine Frontline Base, 15th – To reinforce their forces and solidify their beachhead, the American enemy in Lingayen Gulf is attempting reinforcements by sea. The Japanese air force is continuing its attacks on enemy warships in the bay. On the morning of the 14th, special attack squadrons repeatedly and fiercely attacked enemy fleets in Lingayen Gulf and off the west of Iba. Confirmed results from the escorting aircraft alone include seven enemy transport ships sunk, four ships set ablaze, and one destroyer destroyed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – Before the enemy landed on Mindoro Island (December 15th), on the morning of the 14th, the Japanese Special Attack "Kikusui" Flight Corps and others attacked enemy transport fleets and escort vessels off San Jose, making heroic sacrifices. The confirmed results at the time were unclear due to the direct escort aircraft not returning. It is now confirmed that they achieved the brilliant result of sinking over twenty enemy ships.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 15th – According to a German News Agency report: "Afton Tidning" of New York reports, citing recent news from the Philippines, that American forces on Luzon Island are currently encountering strong resistance from the Japanese army. The report continues, stating that the war situation has become more serious, with reports of strong Japanese advances in all areas.</p>
<p>Supply Routes of Enemy American Forces on Luzon Island Threatened</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th – Lingayen Gulf, the landing site chosen by the enemy American forces on Luzon Island, is the same place where Lieutenant General Homma Masaharu's Japanese forces landed their main force during the capture of the Philippines. The nearshore area is generally shallow, making it ideal for landing. Strategically, the area between Lingayen and Manila is the central Luzon plain, allowing mechanized forces to move freely. The distance from Lingayen to Manila is 250 kilometers, with a flat highway connecting them, reachable by ordinary car in just two hours. Looking back, at that time, Lieutenant General Wainwright, the highest commander of the enemy American forces on Luzon Island, deployed his forces from San Fernando to Lingayen Gulf, with the 21st Division defending from Dagupan to Lingayen, the 31st Division from Tarlac to near Iba, and the 51st Division on the south coast of Bataan. A mixed American-Filipino division was stationed near Manila. Before the Japanese landing, the 3rd Division, reinforced from the Visayas Islands, was placed under the command of the 11th and 21st Divisions. Therefore, the units that fought the Japanese landing forces in the Lingayen area were the 11th and 21st Divisions, the 71st and 91st Divisions reinforced from the Visayas Islands, and one special forces division, totaling five divisions. The Japanese landing forces engaged the enemy cavalry and tank units in fierce battles, quickly annihilating these five divisions and advancing towards Manila with a surge of momentum. Therefore, the enemy's landing in the Philippines this time can be said to be imitating the Japanese. What is noteworthy is that the enemy's supply route to the landing site travels 1,500 kilometers from the Surigao Strait, through the Mindanao Sea and Sulu Sea, and then around to the west coast of Luzon. At a normal fleet speed of 15 miles per hour, it would take at least two days and nights. Even for fast escort ships with a speed of 20 miles per hour, it would still take over 43 hours. The enemy's chosen landing site's supply route is constantly threatened by Japanese air and submarine forces along the way. The enemy's operational command is, of course, very familiar with this point.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Army Ministry Announces Awarded Units for Achievements in the South Seas, Burma, and Other Regions <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th – The Japanese Army Ministry announced today that His Majesty the Emperor has granted commendations to various Japanese units and brave soldiers for their distinguished service in air operations in the South Pacific and Burma fronts, as well as in operations in Central China. The names and summaries of the military achievements of these units and soldiers are listed below: The Nomoto Bomber Squadron was deployed to the Morotai and western New Guinea areas from early January of last year, engaging in enemy combat power annihilation operations. On the morning of December 6th, they conducted a surprise attack on Morotai, achieving great results and greatly assisting the Philippine war situation. The Ichikawa Reconnaissance Flight Corps contributed to the search of the Southwest Pacific region, especially since the enemy landed on Morotai and Leyte. They served as the eyes and ears of the army, providing detailed and accurate reconnaissance of enemy aircraft, greatly assisting in war guidance. Another deputy flight unit completed extremely difficult tasks against a superior enemy air force with few troops, making great contributions to operations in Burma. The Meiri Kesera Airport Service Unit, a branch of the Kesera Airport unit, a strategic location in central Burma, worked hard to assist the flight units and intercepted attacking enemy aircraft, shooting down 62 of them. Lieutenant Nakamura Saburo of the Army has flown 154 sorties since attacking Baoshan Airport on May 4, Showa 17 (1942), either attacking or intercepting. The unit under his command shot down 85 enemy aircraft. The Okada unit was responsible for the defense against the enemy in Yichang. In June of last year, they used superior technology to attack enemy positions six times, defeating them and laying the foundation for the smooth operation in Hunan. The Tanaka unit defended the salient position of Xiling Mountain north of Yichang, repelling over 30 attacks by enemy battalions last year, inflicting annihilating blows on four enemy battalions.</p>

<p>Mayor Zhou and the other newly appointed municipal officials assumed their posts yesterday. Mayor Zhou also issued a letter to the citizens and an inaugural address. Secretary-General Luo also made a speech. From these texts, we can observe the direction of the city's administration in the future. After reading Mayor Zhou's letter to the citizens, we also have some thoughts that we would like to discuss with the Mayor and the citizens. First, the first paragraph of the Mayor's letter to the citizens states: "...my best friends and well-wishers from friendly countries have advised me not to take on this job. They are all acting out of concern for me, not wanting me to come to Shanghai to sacrifice myself. They believe that the situation in Shanghai will only become more difficult and worse in the future, and no one will be able to do anything about it..." Indeed, the situation in Shanghai is truly difficult, and the environment in Shanghai is truly bad. Therefore, this burden is indeed quite heavy. Since the passing of the late Chairman Wang and the succession of former Mayor Chen to the central government as acting chairman, he had no time to concurrently serve as the mayor of this city. Looking around, we thought that this heavy burden should be shouldered by Mr. Zhou Fohai. However, more than a month passed, and the central government had not yet announced the candidate for mayor, hesitating and undecided, which made us very anxious. In the editorial of this newspaper on December 25 of last year, we pointed out the importance of Shanghai's position and hoped that a decision would be made and announced as soon as possible. Therefore, our opinion was contrary to that of Mr. Zhou's well-wishers. Our meaning did not seem to be the meaning of Mr. Zhou's best friends. However, later facts proved that Mr. Zhou still shouldered this heavy burden. We expressed our twelvefold joy in the editorial of this newspaper on January 4th of this year.</p>
<p>Second, the second paragraph of the letter to the citizens states: "...I hope that everyone will not have any expectations of me. Without expectations, there will be no disappointment in the future. The greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment in the future. I do not want everyone to be disappointed in the future, so please do not have any expectations now..." We believe that these words are Mr. Zhou's self-deprecating remarks. We certainly have expectations, but we will definitely not be disappointed. Because although the environment in Shanghai is bad, it is not impossible to do anything about it. Mayor Zhou has made two guarantees to the citizens: (1) We will work hard, earnestly, and resolutely. We will not perfunctorily, passively, or complacently avoid hard work and complaints, and we will not engage in bureaucratic jargon. We will diligently work hard and do our best to seek the welfare of the citizens. (2) My cadres and I are all young and promising. Our spirit is that public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual. We will not use our powers and positions to seek personal gain. We will follow the spirit of integrity in politics established by Acting Chairman Chen, lead by example, and not be corrupt, violate the law, engage in bribery, or seize wealth unjustly. We will diligently investigate, rectify, and do our best to reduce the suffering of the citizens. These two guarantees alone already meet the expectations of the citizens. As long as the guarantees are thoroughly implemented, there will definitely be no disappointment.</p>
<p>Third, the letter to the citizens also mentions the principle of "using severe punishment in a chaotic world." For corrupt officials, treacherous merchants, and evil elements who commit wrongdoing, we will never tolerate or be lenient. We will conduct thorough investigations, obtain concrete evidence, and impose severe punishments. "Using severe punishment in a chaotic world" is something that we have repeatedly advocated in the past. However, although Shanghai is a city of all evils, there are so many rumors. Hoarding, speculation, and manipulating prices are so clever. Unfortunately, severe punishments have never been used, so wrongdoing has become increasingly rampant. We hope that the principle of severe punishment will be thoroughly implemented in the future, especially to eliminate excessive profits and use all efforts to suppress prices. This will reduce the suffering of the citizens and seek the welfare of the citizens. In this way, we can also guarantee that the cooperation of the citizens will be absolutely no problem.</p>
<p>Next, Mayor Zhou's inaugural address, although addressed to public officials, the point of encouraging them to fulfill their duties should also be noted by us citizens. For example, in the Baojia system, every citizen has prescribed tasks. Everyone must fulfill their duties and maximize the effectiveness of the Baojia.</p>
<p>Finally, we suggest, as we have always advocated, that the solution to Shanghai's problems requires a core force to promote it. The formation of this core is the mutual cooperation of the three forces: the municipal government, the people, and the related agencies of the allied countries, to condense into a core. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities, as well as civil leaders, will work together to achieve this.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo put forward three points in his speech yesterday. Due to space limitations, we will discuss them tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Mayor Zhou Concurrently Serves as Security Commander, Delivers Inaugural Address <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Zhou of Shanghai, concurrently serving as Security Commander, delivered the following inaugural address yesterday: "This time, I have been appointed in the autumn of crisis and turmoil, and I deeply feel the weight of the responsibility, the difficulty of the environment, and the weakness of my personal abilities. Therefore, I deeply fear that I will not be able to fulfill the mission entrusted by the government or realize the expectations of people from all walks of life at home and abroad. In the future, I will do my best to use my intelligence and talents to serve the citizens of Shanghai. I hope that all my colleagues, both civil and military, in this government and headquarters will do their utmost. The Shanghai municipal administration has been established on a solid foundation and fundamental plan under the management of former Mayor Chen. In the future, I will only seek to implement and complete it step by step on the established foundation, according to the established plan. There are no new policies or plans. However, there are a few points that I would like to mention when I take office today and meet the officials of this government headquarters for the first time.</p>
<p>Each Fulfilling Their Duties</p>
<p>First, I hope that everyone will fulfill their respective duties. This may sound like a cliché, but in the past, no matter what agency or personnel, to be honest, it has not been fully achieved. We must know that what we can do to serve the country and society does not need to be ambitious. As long as we can fulfill our respective duties, that is enough. What the country and society need from us is nothing more than fulfilling our respective responsibilities. If public officials across the country could fulfill their respective duties, the country would have long been strong and prosperous. How could it be as fragmented as it is today? I hope that the public officials of this government headquarters will treat the duties they undertake as their own business. Do not neglect, do not slacken, and do not perfunctorily perform your duties. If the superiors do not supervise, they will not work hard. Even if they are supervised, they will still outwardly comply but inwardly resist. Not only will the cause not be advanced, but the individual will also be unworthy of the country and the people, having eaten the country's salary and received the people's support. Therefore, I hope that everyone will act with conscience and be faithful to their duties.</p>
<p>Do Not Seek Private Gain</p>
<p>Second, I hope that everyone will not use their powers to seek private gain. The reason why the country and society need us is to have us do things for the country and seek welfare for the people. If we use our powers and positions to do things that harm the country and the people, not only will the law not forgive us, but morality will not allow it. Shanghai, a place that has been ruled by Anglo-American imperialism for a hundred years, has become a city of all evils. The environment is too bad, and there are too many temptations. It is certainly not easy for everyone to maintain integrity and not be tempted by the environment. However, we must be frugal, persevering, and use the spiritual power of morality to overcome material temptations. Actions that harm the country and the people are not allowed by our own conscience. In the future, if any acts of fraud are discovered, I will impose severe penalties according to the law. I hope that everyone will also be self-aware and self-disciplined in their morals and conscience.</p>
<p>Raise Treatment</p>
<p>Third, raise the salaries of civil servants to the greatest possible extent. We ask civil servants to fulfill their duties, and we ask them not to use public office for private gain. However, we must do our best to ensure that their minimum living standards are maintained. The salaries of Shanghai municipal civil servants have been raised repeatedly by former Mayor Chen, and the lives of civil servants have been slightly stabilized. However, prices are rising too fast, and it has become a problem again. Now, we plan to increase the salaries of civil servants and military police again. However, Shanghai's finances have fallen into a state of imbalance between revenue and expenditure. If we increase salaries further, expenditure will increase, and the gap between revenue and expenditure will widen even more. I do not want to burden the people too heavily at once, so I want to start by reorganizing tax collection and eliminating embezzlement, and strive to raise salaries to the extent permitted by financial resources. However, during wartime, the lives of officials and people in any country are hard. While the government will do its best to increase salaries, it is hoped that everyone will not forget that it is wartime and will also endure the hardships of life as much as possible.</p>
<p>Personnel Issues</p>
<p>Fourth, I would also like to say something about personnel issues. I have no intention of placing my own people, and I have no need to place my own people. Therefore, I will not change the personnel of this government headquarters casually. However, I want to do things, and I want to do things well. To do things and do them well, I need people with good abilities and good character. Therefore, as long as you are capable and have good character, everyone can rest assured that you will not be changed. As for how to judge whether someone has ability and character, it will of course be determined by objective investigation, and it will never be based on subjective likes and dislikes. I personally, and my cadres as well, will do this. Everyone can rest assured about this. Today, I am taking the opportunity of taking office to briefly express what I want to say. In the future, there will be many difficult problems, and it will not be easy to solve these problems. We can only do our best to do things step by step, without calculating gains or losses, without caring about praise or blame, and without rejecting hard work and complaints. As for right and wrong, we can only let society judge with a fair eye."</p>
<h3 id="e5">Enemy American Remnant Fleet to Be Annihilated, Japanese Naval Expert Discusses Philippine Island Battle Situation <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>As the battle for Luzon Island intensifies, a naval expert from the Allied Powers in Shanghai has analyzed the island's battle situation, stating:</p>
<p>Major Battle Will Occur in Luzon Plain</p>
<p>The enemy landing forces in Lingayen Gulf and San Fabian consist of two divisions and a tank unit. The enemy's second and third fleets have arrived near Lingayen Gulf, but do not appear to have landed. The Japanese garrison on the Philippines is currently eliminating the landed enemy forces on the shore. Generals Yamashita and Oga, the commanders of the Japanese forces on the Philippines, have deployed positions along the Agno River, farther from the Lingayen coast, and will engage the enemy in open field battles in the Luzon central plain. The major battle between the Japanese and American forces is about to unfold there. Although part of the enemy air force currently has a slight advantage, it has not yet encountered the open field battles that Japan excels in. The central plains area is beyond the range of the enemy's artillery, making it easier for the Japanese army to use clever tactics. It remains to be seen whether General MacArthur's forces can cope with this most elite open field warfare. At the same time, the Japanese army will inflict maximum attrition on the enemy forces there. Luzon Island is currently in the dry season, which is suitable for open field battles. Japan is stepping up the production of aircraft and sending them to the front lines to strengthen combat capabilities.</p>
<p>Japanese Fleet Prepares for Completion</p>
<p>It is noteworthy what actions the enemy American fleet will take in the seas east of the Philippines and Taiwan in the future. The enemy is gathering forces in the seas around Taiwan and the Philippines, and the Australian and British Pacific Fleets have also been dispatched. Their naval power cannot be underestimated. However, the movements of the Nimitz Fleet may undergo considerable changes. The Japanese Combined Fleet has completed preparations for operations and is closely monitoring the activities of the Nimitz Fleet. Therefore, a major naval battle will occur in the Pacific. As for the appearance of the British Indian Ocean Fleet near Sumatra, it is of a containment nature and has no other effect. In short, this naval and land battle will be the decisive battle for the Greater East Asia War. During the battle, the United States has two major weaknesses:</p>
<p>Two Major Weaknesses of the Enemy Americans</p>
<p>(1) The incompleteness of the supply lines, especially the shortage of fuel, is the biggest reason.</p>
<p>(2) The shortage of troops. According to MacArthur, 200,000 troops have already been used in the Philippine operation. Currently, the enemy has no troops in the New Guinea area. It is a question where they will obtain troops to operate in other locations, especially how they will sustain operations in the Luzon central plain. This is a problem. On the Japanese side, there are no such shortcomings. The Japanese Navy is preparing to annihilate all remaining enemy American fleets from the previous operation.</p>
<p>Unrest in the United States</p>
<p>Currently, there is considerable unrest in the United States. Although Roosevelt has been rapidly appointed president for the fourth time, riots are occurring everywhere domestically. Therefore, the American landing on the Philippines is a propaganda tactic that is advantageous for Roosevelt domestically, used to suppress the riots. However, from a geographical perspective, the United States is making a long trek to invade the Philippines, which is consuming a huge amount of resources. There are endless hidden dangers domestically. Although the United States is currently touting its efforts to produce aircraft, it faces many difficulties due to the lack of labor, making it extremely difficult to achieve its production goals.</p>
<p>Difficult Battle Situation for Landing Enemy Forces</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The American forces' Philippine landing operation, which began last October, has reached its peak intensity since the landing on Luzon Island. During this period, the American forces have experienced unprecedented bloodshed in history, but they have repeatedly increased their forces, sparing no sacrifice, betting the fate of the country in a desperate last stand, and provoking the final decisive battle. It is not only the counterattack of the elite Japanese forces that is hindering the American advance, and the enemy themselves have made this clear. Here are a few points about the difficult battle situation for the landing operation on Luzon Island that they have disclosed:</p>
<p>The first is that the enemy has forgotten the Philippines' declaration of war against the United States. In these two years, the people of the Philippines have independently established the Greater Philippines Republic, taking on the responsibility of building a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and resolutely declaring war on the United States. However, it is very regrettable that this fact has not been recognized by the American forces. They believe that as long as they land on the Philippines, the residents will raise their hands to welcome them and provide all assistance. However, the Filipinos are no longer slaves of the United States.</p>
<p>MacArthur's headquarters recently announced that, concerning the organization of guerrillas on Luzon Island, they do not expect to assist the American forces or resist the Japanese forces. For example, a considerable number of Filipinos are currently assisting the Japanese forces, acting as spies for the Japanese army, and are quite active. Guerrilla warfare is important for the liberation of Luzon Island, but guerrillas often collude with the enemy, so organizing guerrillas is impossible.</p>
<p>The second point is the lack of ships during the landing operation. According to a Huitong News Agency dispatch from Stockholm on the 12th, the American forces lacked ships during the landing on Luzon Island, and had to request them from anti-Axis countries. British Home Secretary Richard Law embarked on a trip to the United States regarding this issue. Last autumn, the anti-Axis powers originally expected the European war to be coming to an end, but it ultimately failed. In Europe, transporting a division of troops requires 50,000 tons of ships and takes two weeks. However, sending the same division of troops to Luzon Island requires 200,000 tons of ships and takes five months. In short, the operation implemented four months ago based on the misunderstanding that the European war was nearing its end has fundamentally faltered in the current situation. The Pacific warship plan, which they deliberated on at the Quebec Conference last autumn based on the European war situation, has failed, making the operation extremely difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Raid on Nagoya Enemy Aircraft: 43 Shot Down; Divine Land Bombed, Japanese People Outraged <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on the 15th: On January 14th, enemy aircraft attacked the vicinity of Nagoya. After engagement by Japanese forces, the battle results were determined as follows: 9 enemy aircraft shot down, 34 damaged. One Japanese aircraft failed to return.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 14th: At 4:00 PM on the 14th, approximately 60 B-29 type aircraft from the Mariana Islands attacked, centering on the vicinity of Nagoya. An enemy aircraft dropped several bombs on the grounds of the Toyouke Daijingu Shrine, destroying two meditation halls and five Kagura halls. Other damage to the Japanese side was minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – News from Nagoya: The Ise Grand Shrine in Japan has a long history of 2,605 years and is revered by the Japanese people. On the 14th, American planes attacked Nagoya and bombed part of the shrine. The weather that day was very clear, and the enemy forces clearly knew that there were no factory facilities nearby. Therefore, the enemy aircraft's violent act against the shrine can be determined to be intentional. The Japanese people are greatly angered by the enemy's immoral behavior. All Tokyo newspapers on the 15th published the people's anger.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a Nagoya phone call: On the afternoon of the 14th, enemy aircraft invading the Tokai region of Japan carried out the violent act of bombing part of the Ise Grand Shrine, which is revered by the Japanese people. At 2:53 PM that afternoon, three enemy aircraft appeared over the holy site and dropped bombs simultaneously on the outer shrine grounds, landing in the shrine forest, destroying five Kagura halls and two meditation halls. The sacred symbols are all safe. There are no factories or other important facilities near the shrine. Therefore, all Japanese people are outraged by this enemy atrocity and are determined to exterminate the enemy of humanity and the enemy of culture and religion. The Ise Grand Shrine consists of the Kotaijingu and Toyouke Daijingu shrines, commonly known as the inner and outer shrines. The enshrined deity is Toyouke Omikami, who is in charge of agriculture, nurturing living beings, protecting Japan, and laying the foundation for a rich country and a strong army. The deity is extremely revered by the Japanese people.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Bose Declares Determination; Encourages Indians to Rise Up; Cooperate to Complete the War <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Burma Base, 15th (Central News Agency) – Subhas Chandra Bose, chairman of the Provisional Government of India, returned to the military base in Burma on the 10th. On the 12th, he met with a delegation of journalists and announced the determination of the Free India government as follows: I visited Tokyo during the tense situation of the fierce battle in the Philippines. I saw the true state of Japan under wartime conditions. I am convinced that my previous statement that the anti-Axis offensive has reached its peak and that the Axis powers will begin a general counter-offensive was not wrong. Our friendly nations, Japan and Germany, are now entering a new offensive posture, regaining the initiative of the war, and advancing towards the decisive battle. This general offensive in Greater East Asia has entered a new stage, and India (in addition to the past) must complete important tasks. The main purpose of my visit to Japan this time is to complete these important tasks and review important issues related to this. During my visit to Japan, I met individually with Prime Minister Koiso and other cabinet members. Political and military issues have been fully discussed in detail. Japan and India have decided to unite more closely in the future, cooperate together, and complete the war. I believe that the new actions of the Indian National Army will soon prove this. We must make the ugly enemy shed more blood than last year. With this confidence, I visited various parts of Greater East Asia, hoping that all three million compatriots in East Asia will respond to this, devote all their property, and rise up with the determination to fight for independence. During my visit to Japan, I witnessed the spirit of the Japanese special attack forces, who sacrificed their blood and flesh to strike at the arrogant enemy, and I was deeply moved. I believe that similar actions to the Kamikaze special attack team will appear this year, making the holy war even more courageous. The date when we cooperate with the Japanese army to attack the enemy is approaching. Once we break through the British defense line of India, Chittagong and Imphal, then the independent resistance of all India will be confirmed, and the time for the collapse of British power in India is near. The autumn of victory in the Greater East Asia War means that the anti-British sentiment in India will never be extinguished. Three hundred and eighty million compatriots in the country are waiting for the uprising. We take the strongholds from Nikkei in the south to Kohima in the north as the key points of the Indo-Burma front. With our combat experience, we are confident that we can defeat the enemy without a doubt. We are about to begin our advance.</p>
<h3 id="e8">German Reporter on the Pacific War Situation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – German People's Observer naval reporter, Gurode Schuland, discussed the Philippine war situation in the newspaper on the 13th, with the main idea as follows: Japan has fully recognized the importance of the Philippines. The success of the operation to destroy the US air force base in South China is also a consideration for the future battle for the Philippines. Today, the US and Japanese armies have met on a vast battlefield, and the use of naval and air forces has become the most important element. The US military has driven heavy fleets far from its bases to the South China Sea and begun dangerous work. The US is using a large number of aircraft carriers to cover landing craft because of insufficient air power at the bases on Leyte Island and Mindoro Island. The strength of the Japanese fleet has been admitted by the US military. It still maintains a strong force and is also deploying Kamikaze special attack teams. Therefore, the Japanese military's combat power has been significantly enhanced. The United Kingdom is also preparing to attack Japan in the southern waters, which is an open secret. Therefore, the development of the Philippine naval battle is increasingly important, presenting a rarely seen harsh and serious situation in the Pacific War.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Illegal Attack on the Hikawa Maru: Japan Lodges Protest; US Planes Attack Hospital Ship for the 19th Time <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – The US Air Force previously carried out an illegal attack on the Japanese hospital ship, which caused deep anger in the Japanese government and public. The enemy has repeated this illegal act. The Japanese government has lodged a serious protest against the enemy's illegal behavior, demanding responsibility. On November 25th last year, the Japanese medical ship Hikawa Maru, carrying wounded and sick, was sailing in the waters west of the Bataan Peninsula. At approximately 8:50 AM, in clear visibility, four US planes appeared and dropped bombs from a height of 1,500 meters, followed by machine-gun fire on the deck and bridge. Thirty minutes later, at 9:30 AM, two more US planes appeared, flying at a low altitude of 1,200 meters and strafing with machine guns. Due to this repeated illegal attack, Japanese medical personnel were injured or killed, and the ship was severely damaged. Thanks to the efforts of the captain and all the crew, it avoided sinking, but navigation in the afternoon and the care of the wounded and sick were greatly hampered.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – US military aircraft have repeatedly bombed Japanese hospital ships. The Japanese government has demanded that the US government reflect on this illegal behavior based on the 1907 Geneva Convention, international law, and violations of humanitarianism. This time, the US military illegally bombed the Hikawa Maru hospital ship again, so it had no choice but to lodge the 19th protest. After the Japanese government protested to the United States about the sinking of the Japanese hospital ship Buenos Aires Maru in November of the year before last, the US government made a detailed defense of respecting the intent of hospital ships. However, last November, it sank the Muro Maru, resulting in this protest. On the 25th of the same month, it bombed the Hikawa Maru again. This was by no means a misidentification due to weather visibility or other circumstances. Therefore, it can be determined that they deliberately attacked unarmed hospital ships. Furthermore, the name, characteristics, and markings of Japanese hospital ships have been formally notified to the US government. However, since the beginning of the war, Japanese hospital ships have been attacked by the US military as many as eighteen times, and among them, the Buenos Aires Maru and the Muro Maru were sunk.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Major Decisive Battle Unfolds at the Baranow Bridgehead; Fighting Especially Fierce in the East Prussian Region <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The long-awaited major battle on the Eastern Front has begun. Both sides are fighting to the death on a front stretching more than 1,000 kilometers from Budapest to the Niemen River. The great battle in the East Prussian border area, between Lisa Gora Mountain and the Vistula River, has overshadowed the battles of Kolan and Hongjing. The battle is still in its early stages, and it is unknown what counter-measures the German authorities will take to deal with the Soviet offensive. One focus of the battle is the Baranow bridgehead, where most of four Soviet army corps, one tank army, and three independent tank regiments are located. The southern Soviet army has made slight progress, and a German counterattack has driven the Soviet army back. The pressure of the Soviet army is very strong on the southeastern slope of Lisa Gora Mountain, but the German army is still able to maintain its position. Six Soviet tanks were lost at Baranow. Another focus is the East Prussian region. The Soviet army bombarded with 350 artillery pieces in two hours, and then used 15 infantry divisions and tank teams to break through between Ebenrode and Schloßberg, but failed. The first batch of Soviet troops was heavily bombarded by German artillery, and only the southern suburbs of Schloßberg were broken through. German reserve troops quickly counterattacked and have advanced eastward. Although the weather is bad, the German air force is still providing strong support.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: Finland and Sweden will begin important economic negotiations today. The Finnish Minister of Supply and the Minister of Commerce, along with several experts, have now arrived here. The former Finnish Ambassador to Sweden, Wassastina, arrived here a few days ago to prepare for the negotiations. The purpose of the negotiations is to determine the amount of food that Sweden can transport in the next three to six months. Currently, Sweden's food transportation is not proceeding according to plan due to transportation difficulties, which is the reason for the previous rumors of negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union. At the same time, the transportation of raw materials from Sweden to Finland to help develop the metal industry will also be discussed. It is still difficult to predict Sweden's ability to supply, but for the sake of Sweden's interests, it is necessary to help Finland's economy avoid collapse and prevent the Soviet Union from exerting political pressure on Finland again.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Wartime Manchukuo <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Speech by Zhang Jinghui</p>
<p>The national strength of Manchukuo is growing with the times, its international standing is steadily rising, and it has made great contributions to completing the Greater East Asia War. The Emperor of Manchukuo is greatly concerned with strengthening the war effort of allied nations. Previously, to conserve steel resources, he ordered the suspension of the construction of the new palace. Recently, he has further promoted the campaign to collect platinum and gold, offering up everyday platinum products, bronzeware, and works of art as a demonstration to the people. The Prime Minister, Zhang, with a calm and unhurried demeanor, commands the people and enjoys their trust. On December 2nd, when a reporter (Kusumi, special correspondent) visited the State Council, he was granted an audience with Prime Minister Zhang, who delivered a grand speech:</p>
<p>"Manchukuo must overcome all difficulties, increase production, and cooperate with allied nations. The difference between the relationship between Japan and Manchukuo and other nations in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is, as His Majesty the Emperor has declared, that we are inseparable in life and death, just like flesh and blood. This war is truly decisive for the destiny of East Asia. If the war is lost, we Orientals will become slaves of the Anglo-Americans. Therefore, we must fight to the end; and I myself hold an unwavering belief that this war will be won. Manchukuo's responsibility grows ever greater as the war situation progresses. To defend Greater East Asia, we must gather the total strength of all our people and engage in a death-or-glory struggle in all production sectors."</p>
<p>When the editor brought up the matter of special attack units, he briefly said:</p>
<p>"Regarding the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, I have read about it in the newspapers. I have also heard others talk about the news of the Army Special Attack Corps. I am filled with admiration and respect. A few days ago, I saw a film of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps departing, and when I saw the scene of them drinking and embarking on their journey, I couldn't help but shed tears. I deeply feel that since the allied soldiers are fighting so bravely, Manchukuo must work harder to increase production in response."</p>
<p>The morale of wartime Manchukuo can also be felt from Prime Minister Zhang.</p>
<p>Agricultural Production Increase Campaign</p>
<p>Today is the peak season for the collection of agricultural products in Manchukuo. Manchukuo's agriculture bears the important task of supplying food to China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The amount of produce supplied by farmers increases year by year, and this year an unprecedentedly large procurement target has been set. Last year and this year (Republic of China years 32 and 33) have both been years of bumper harvests unseen in recent times. The harvest work is now proceeding according to a new plan and direction. The whole of Manchukuo presents a lively atmosphere, and the amount collected has reached 50% of the target, fully demonstrating the power of the food source of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>The Manchukuo government has now formulated countermeasures for increasing production in the coming year, deciding to increase production targets by 10% for general farmers and 50% for settlers. In addition, to improve agricultural affairs, various policies are also being studied in terms of technical mobilization at agricultural organizations, research institutes, agricultural experiment stations, and the like. In addition, the construction of reclaimed farmland, which has been the focus of implementation since this year, is also progressing steadily. The first water lifting station project, the central facility of the Second Songhua River area project, a large-scale project that boasts to be unparalleled in the world, has been completed on schedule. In the northern part of Manchukuo, the construction of waterways using the frozen period is also progressing steadily, with continuous efforts being made in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Leap Forward in Light Metals Industry</p>
<p>As for the mining and industrial sectors, problems with labor and equipment are unavoidable for rapidly developing emerging countries, but they are currently overcoming numerous difficulties and continuing their efforts. In the past, all mining and industrial production equipment was supplied by Japan, Germany, the United States, and overseas. Today, with the rapid development of the domestic machine tool industry, measures are being promoted to encourage the effective use of existing equipment and the repair of damaged equipment, exploring various creative methods in the use of equipment that can be called the greatest frugality.</p>
<p>The current state of coal production in Manchukuo, which is rich in coal deposits, is particularly promising in the old Manchurian coalfields. In addition, promising new coalfield projects in certain areas of Sanjiang Province and Tonghua Province are also progressing steadily. The production target for the coming year is 20% higher than this year's production target, and preparations are underway.</p>
<p>The Manchurian Steel Manufacturing Company, which undertakes one wing of the wartime allied steel industry, is seeking ways to increase production with a new spirit. The Anshan area has now become a target for enemy bombing, but the steel production warriors are fighting against enemy aircraft, desperately striving to ensure absolute production. As for the light metals industry, in response to the wartime demand that "the more airplanes, the better," measures to increase the production of aluminum are being actively studied, and the future is very promising.</p>
<p>In addition, the increase in production of molybdenum, flake graphite, tungsten, shale oil, etc. is also progressing. Tartaric acid lime, which has emerged with a new mission as a resource for modern weapons, has mobilized all the wild grapes that are a specialty of Manchukuo. In addition, the increased production of alcohol and the distilleries that produce sorghum liquor are being revived with the cooperation of Manchurian indigenous capital. The forests of northeastern Manchukuo, which are sealed off by ice and snow, have entered the peak season for winter logging, and efforts are being made to urgently mobilize wartime timber resources. On the other hand, the railways that transport these timber, agricultural products, and the large amount of coal needed in winter are also engaged in a fierce struggle for decisive transportation, regardless of adverse conditions such as supply difficulties.</p>
<p>Labor Service System</p>
<p>From this year to the coming year, among the most noteworthy issues, the decisive labor mobilization situation is one aspect. The rapidly expanding and strengthening wartime industry requires a great deal of labor, and recruiting labor from North China is simply hopeless due to price differences. As a result, the domestic labor supply situation, especially the labor required by the wartime industry, must be secured domestically. Regarding this matter, the National Labor Service System, which has been implemented since last year, has already achieved good results. On the other hand, the "Labor Service System" for Japanese and Manchurian students also echoes the Japanese mainland. Since the end of September, students above the senior level of both male and female secondary schools have been subject to year-round mobilization, which will be further expanded and strengthened in the coming year.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen labor countermeasures, the government authorities passed the "Outline for the Implementation of Decisive Labor Mobilization" at the State Council meeting on November 15th, deciding to apply it from the coming year. Until now, a labor supply policy that does not require North Chinese labor has been established since the founding of the country. The framework for this policy is a mobilization plan based on the preparation of labor mobilization registers, as well as the renewal of labor management and the establishment of labor bases for various important industries.</p>
<p>In addition, in view of the urgent labor situation, the Japanese Kwantung Army has twice recruited a large number of female military personnel, allowing male military personnel who originally worked in the army to be transferred to important industrial sectors. The government is also implementing the labor workplace mobilization of government special organization staff. Under the leadership of the governor, the Political Affairs Department is the base, and all 1,000 Japanese and Manchurian staff members under the age of 30 are sent to the aircraft and steel production sectors. Due to the government's leading by example, a trend of stepping forward to work in wartime industries has been fostered in the private sector. The current Manchukuo, closely following the intense war situation, is increasingly showing its majestic spirit. People of all ethnic groups from all walks of life are working together with one heart and one mind, uniting to destroy the enemy Anglo-Americans, and advancing together towards a victorious future.

<h3 id="e25">Secretary-General Luo Announces Key Points of Administration - Three Main Points Proposed <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The newly appointed Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, Luo Junqiang, together with the newly appointed Director of the Municipal Government's Propaganda Department, Liu Dexuan, met with Chinese and Japanese news reporters in the conference hall of the Municipal Government Building at 5:30 p.m. yesterday (the 15th) to announce the key points of the Municipal Government's administration and introduce the newly appointed Director of the Propaganda Department, Liu, and the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Municipal Government, Cao Gonggang. Luo said: "I have been ordered to participate in the work of the Shanghai Municipal Government this time. I will take the determination of fighting for the revolution together with the newly appointed Mayor Zhou for the past twenty years and move forward with even more perseverance and diligence. Mayor Zhou has repeatedly declined the concurrent position of Mayor of Shanghai to the highest authorities due to the heavy burden of his various positions. However, due to various reasons, he resolutely took on this important task, which is related to the future of Greater Shanghai and the welfare of all citizens. The mayor has frankly described this in an article addressed to the people of Shanghai and in his inaugural speech. As for the key points of the Municipal Government's administration in the future, I will briefly present several items in accordance with the special instructions of President Chen of the Executive Yuan and Mayor Zhou:</p>
<p>Work Hard and Lead by Example</p>
<p>(1) Work hard and lead by example. The reason why Mayor Zhou did not issue a grand declaration of administration at the beginning of his tenure is that Mayor Zhou is one of the key officials in the central government. The policies promoted by Acting Chairman Chen in accordance with the will of the late Chairman Wang are the policies promoted by the Municipal Government. It is only necessary to follow these basic policies, adapt to the local conditions and the times, and use the necessary means to promote their implementation. Today, public officials, regardless of whether they are civil or military, regardless of their rank, must work hard and lead by example in order to fulfill their mission. Upholding discipline and implementing a clean government policy, at a time when the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage, where should Shanghai start? First, it should be to uphold the discipline of public officials and the entire military police force in order to achieve a clean government. First, it is necessary to guarantee the minimum standard of living for officials. Today, in wartime, life is inherently a very simple issue, and the lives of officials must naturally be subject to the restrictions that should be imposed during wartime. It is natural that some bad and unnecessary personnel in public offices should be eliminated. Only those who are diligent in their duties can obtain a corresponding position, and only those who are diligent in their duties have the right to advocate for their livelihood. This is not only a municipal issue, but also the general key point of today's politics. Those who enjoy a considerable degree of livelihood security but still disregard the wartime system and do evil will naturally only be dealt with decisively and punished according to the law.</p>
<p>Increase Production and Cooperate in the War</p>
<p>(2) Increase production, stabilize people's livelihoods, and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. This point is more difficult than the previous two, and we must do our best to implement it. Only by concentrating all human and material resources on production can we stabilize the lives of citizens, which is an active measure to assist the war. Just in terms of labor issues, just like upholding the discipline of officials, benefits must be attributed to the diligent. There is no need to protect those who want to gain without working. In terms of the allocation of daily necessities, we should also increase production and increase transactions in order to seek an absolute increase in production. Regarding this point, we should also value diligent workers. This way, production can be increased, and people's livelihoods can be stabilized, which is to assist the war in spirit and in substance. Also, at this time of war, positive administrative measures such as prohibiting waste and saving consumption should also be carried out simultaneously. In short, there are many problems, and we should especially strive for contact between superiors and subordinates, and between left and right. We hope that the relevant agencies will provide more assistance and work together to promote various affairs, and we hope that all the citizens of Shanghai and the elders and advanced members of the community will diligently supervise and guide us so that we can fully implement the above-mentioned administration. Public and private matters are very difficult."</p>
<h3 id="e26">Inauguration Ceremony of New and Old Police Chiefs - Commander Zhou Encourages Them to Be Honorable Police <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The newly appointed Police Chief of Shanghai Zhou Fohai, at 11:00 a.m. yesterday (the 15th), held a ceremony in the hall on the eighth floor of the Police Bureau. Deputy Chiefs Su Chengde and Lu Ying, Chief Sun Lifu, and more than one hundred senior police officers above the level of department heads, section chiefs, and branch chiefs respectfully welcomed Commander Zhou, who arrived on time with Xiong Jiandong, Chief of Staff of the Security Command of the city. The ceremony began with the Police Bureau's band playing music. After singing the national anthem and performing the ceremony, the new and old chiefs handed over the seals. Deputy Chief Du represented former Chief Chen in handing over the seals. All the staff bowed to the new and old chiefs. Then, Commander Zhou delivered a speech. After the speech, the ceremony ended with music. Commander Zhou went to the police chief's office to take office and met with various senior police officers, whom he encouraged.</p>
<p>There have been some personnel changes in the Police Bureau. Man Qiwai has been appointed as the acting Director of the General Affairs Department. Chief Secretary Sun Lifu's resignation has been approved, and the vacancy has been filled by Li Shiyu, Director of the Judicial Department. Director of the Administrative Department Lu Qi's resignation has been approved, and the vacancy has been filled by Pinggang Yong, Director of the Police Defense Department. Hong Demao has been appointed as Acting Secretary (Recommended). All the above-mentioned directors have gone to the bureau to work yesterday.</p>
<p>Commander Zhou's Speech</p>
<p>"Today, I am taking office as the Police Chief of Shanghai. I am very happy to meet with my colleagues from the Police Bureau for the first time.</p>
<p>When the National Government moved its capital back in 1940, the Ministry of Police Affairs was established. I was ordered to serve as the first Minister of Police Affairs. Now that I have come to Shanghai and am also serving as the Police Chief, I did not expect that I would have such a deep connection with police affairs.</p>
<p>Police Task</p>
<p>The task of the police is to be responsible for implementing government orders for the government and to be responsible for protecting the safety of the people for the people. Therefore, whether the politics are good and whether the people can live and work in peace depends entirely on whether the police can properly perform their duties. If the police cannot properly implement government orders, but instead use various laws and orders to engage in malpractice and self-interest, the politics will never be clear. If the police cannot protect the people, but instead use their strength to oppress or exploit the people, the people will never be at peace. Since the police are responsible for being honest, self-disciplined, and faithfully protecting the people, and for performing their tasks, you all have specialized knowledge and experience, so I don't need to say much more.</p>
<p>Honorable Police</p>
<p>The task of the police is sacred, so the police and police officers should be loved by the people, not hated by the people. To be loved by the people is to be an honorable police officer, and to be hated by the people is to be a disreputable police officer. Every police officer in Shanghai must reflect on themselves, whether they are loved by the citizens or hated by the citizens, whether they are an honorable police officer or a disreputable police officer. Every police officer, whether Chinese or foreign, must ask themselves this question. We must gain the love of the citizens, we must be honorable police officers.</p>
<p>Future Facilities</p>
<p>Completing the honorable police of Shanghai is the foundation of all my future facilities. Under the guidance of former Chief Chen, the police administration of Shanghai has already been on track. My task is to follow this track, gradually reorganize, and gradually enrich it to complete the construction of the honorable police of Shanghai.</p>
<p>My future plan is to increase treatment to the greatest extent possible within the scope permitted by financial resources. At the same time, with the expectations of all parties, I will make the greatest efforts to rectify the network discipline. I hope that all police officers will be self-disciplined and self-motivated."</p>

Regarding the future economic policies of the city, Xu made the following remarks, saying: "Shanghai is the economic center of the region and a major resource base in the rear of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the economic dynamics of Shanghai are more important than anywhere else. I have been ordered to take over as the Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau at a time when production is declining, prices are soaring, and speculation and manipulation are rampant. The people are suffering more and more. I am determined to use my best efforts, be honest and self-disciplined, and, under the leadership of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, actively advance in accordance with the outline of the current economic policy. We must ensure that the economic situation in Greater Shanghai is stable and that all industries and businesses can develop soundly under strict organization, so as to increase production, save consumption, balance prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods. For the policy is not in many words, and at the beginning of my tenure, I would like to take this as the goal of implementation and encourage all businessmen and people in the city."</p>

Now that the key allocation for reporters is about to begin, the Material Distribution Office has sent a letter to the Municipal Propaganda Department to assist in the investigation in order to understand the reporters and editors of various newspapers in the city. It is reported that the Propaganda Department has now sent a letter to the Shanghai News Association and the Journalists Association, requesting various newspapers to list the number of reporters and editors in their respective newspapers for transfer and distribution.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Scarcity of American Goods Has Become a Common Phenomenon: Interview with Director Matsudaira <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference yesterday afternoon. At the conference, Director Matsudaira of the Information Department mentioned the increasing scarcity of goods in the United States since the start of the war, and provided the following information as evidence. The Director also stated that the United States, as a nation, has always been known for its abundance of materials, but today this phenomenon exists. The people of Shanghai should be frugal and economical and be aware of this warning.</p>
<p>Regarding the facts revealed about the recent shortage of supplies in the United States, the following were mentioned: The American army in Europe is using more bandages than originally planned for wounded soldiers. According to yesterday's telegram, Mr. Harley, the head of the Red Cross, stated that three months ago, it was estimated that 100 million rolls of bandages would be needed and sent to Europe for use. During peacetime, 89% of the rubber raw materials consumed in the United States were imported from Malaya. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the source was cut off, resulting in a severe shortage of rubber in the country, and the public could no longer obtain rations of this item. The American paper industry was originally very developed, and Canada produced a lot of paper. However, the situation has changed, and the amount of paper is decreasing daily. Except for newspapers and magazines, which can still obtain paper for publication, other sectors have no paper available, and many large-scale publishing houses have closed down. After the outbreak of the war, there was also a great shortage of clothing materials. Currently, to save clothing materials, it is stipulated that men's jackets cannot use double-breasted buttons, and the bottom of trouser legs cannot be folded. For women, the length of skirts should be two inches below the knee. Last year, the American people could only receive nine pairs of socks per year, but the materials were extremely poor. For better socks, only one pair could be obtained per 35 people. The production of American tobacco is now also much lower than before. Since last summer, residents in various places who want to buy cigarettes have had to line up in front of tobacco shops early in the morning (similar to the rush to buy cigarettes in Shanghai). The military's tobacco ration has been reduced, and the soldiers are generally dissatisfied.</p>
<p>The United States never publishes information about the various situations of material shortages, making it impossible for people to speculate. The actual situation is unknown. Although the above news is mostly fragmentary and trivial, it can be inferred that the phenomenon of material shortages in the United States is quite common.</p>

<h3 id="e37">New Year City Sounds: Actively Evacuate the Population of This City <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>-- Yushun</p>
<p>Evacuating the urban population is one of the important wartime measures. Looking back at Shanghai, the largest city in China, the population has increased since the incident. In the past, the municipal authorities have always adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards this, and fortunately, no tragic consequences have occurred so far. However, with the recent intensification of the war, it is necessary to actively evacuate the population of Shanghai:</p>
<p>The Necessity of Evacuation (1) Air Defense Needs: At this stage of the decisive battle, the war has become fierce, and the dual air raids are becoming more frequent. If the unprecedentedly dense population of this city is not evacuated as soon as possible, casualties will be inevitable once bombing occurs. It will be difficult to provide relief to refugees. The tragedy in Hankou City on December 24 last year is likely to reappear in this city, so it is necessary to prepare in advance.</p>
<p>(2) Economic Needs: The daily necessities of the citizens of this city, except for industrial products that can be obtained locally, such as food and fuel, must be transported from hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Assuming that the citizens who currently reside in Shanghai need to reside in Shanghai in all respects, then this method of supply is still justifiable. However, it is found that at least one-third of the current citizens have no need to reside in Shanghai. If more than one-third of the population is evacuated to food-producing areas and fuel supply areas, at least a lot of manpower and material resources can be saved, and prices in this city can be reduced.</p>
<p>(3) Security Needs: Since this city has been affected by power restrictions and material shortages, industry and commerce have been greatly reduced. Layoffs are often heard, and the number of unemployed has increased sharply. If they are laid off and still have a considerable amount of severance pay in their hands, if they do not return to their hometowns at this time, after a considerable period of time, their funds will be exhausted, and they will inevitably be in a desperate situation where they cannot return to their hometowns or survive, which will be detrimental to the security of this city. Therefore, it is best to evacuate the population around the time of the lunar New Year.</p>
<p>From this, it can be said that the municipal authorities should make actively evacuating the population one of the important policies for this year for the sake of the future of this city.</p>
<p>Evacuation Methods As for the evacuation methods, there are two types: forced evacuation and voluntary evacuation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. However, when the situation is not very tight, it seems that voluntary evacuation has more advantages than disadvantages. In fact, among all the citizens of this city, there are a considerable number of people who are eager to return to their hometowns, but they want to stop because of the difficulty of transportation. If the authorities can urge them and provide them with assistance in travel, they will definitely be willing to return to their hometowns immediately. During the voluntary evacuation period, for example, six months, preparations for forced evacuation can be made at the same time, such as investigating the occupations of citizens to determine the basis for their stay.</p>
<p>The work of evacuating the population should be led by the Social Welfare Bureau, assisted by the various hometown associations in Shanghai and the local authorities of various counties, and it is hoped that the police and transportation agencies will cooperate.</p>
<p>The most difficult problem to solve when evacuating the population is transportation. This requires the cooperation of the Central China Railway Company and the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company and other inland river shipping companies. Regarding the Central China Railway Company, it is hoped that the company will use the empty cars of freight trains returning to Nanjing and Hangzhou to transport citizens returning to their hometowns with the same destination. For example, it is stipulated that the first to fifth cars (counting down) of a certain train are exclusively for passengers returning to Changzhou, and these five cars will be dropped off at Changzhou Station. The eleventh cars and earlier are exclusively for passengers returning to Nanjing. Regarding inland river ships, it is hoped that each company will prepare "evacuation passenger ships" attached to the "normal passenger ships", so that citizens can return to their hometowns by land. It can also be returned by waterway, thus increasing the speed of evacuation. As for car and ship tickets, it is best to waive them, otherwise, a large discount must be given to reduce the burden on citizens returning to their hometowns, and convenience must be provided for carrying luggage.</p>
<p>Citizens returning to their hometowns on free or discounted cars and ships should first obtain a certificate of origin and a return home permit from the various hometown associations in Shanghai and register with the Social Welfare Bureau. Those without hometown associations in Shanghai should obtain a certificate of origin from the Baojia chief. Then, the Social Welfare Bureau will notify the return date and method according to the order of registration.</p>
<p>In short, evacuating citizens is certainly not a simple and easy task, but it is indeed a matter that needs to be handled urgently. It is hoped that the municipal authorities can formulate a meticulous evacuation plan under the principles of convenient procedures, saving expenses, and rapid evacuation, and put it into practice immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Tongde Medical College Takes the Lead in Providing Free Places; Hoping That Authorities of Other Schools Will Follow <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, we wrote to the authorities of various schools, suggesting that stipulating "reasonable tuition and miscellaneous fees" is the most effective way to relieve students from dropping out of school. Sure enough, Tongde  Medical College took the lead in responding, and specially set up ten places for scholarship students and new students with tuition waivers. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern, our college has always been grateful for your newspaper's  heartfelt cultivation of poor students, providing scholarship assistance. In response to the organization of your newspaper's special scholarship fundraising team, our college has specially assisted five scholarship students with tuition waivers, named the "Tongde Medical College Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the ""Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the ""Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the ""Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the ""Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the ""Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," named the "Tongde Medical College Clinic Team," and donated five tuition waivers for new students, named the "Free Consultation and Medicine Distribution Team," especially to inform you, please check." Tongde has a long history, is large in scale, and is extremely well-managed. Anyone familiar with Shanghai's education system can say this. This time, it specially set up ten free places, each worth 50,000 yuan, for a total of 500,000 yuan, which is quite considerable. The school authorities are generous in helping students and benefiting the poor, and their contributions are immeasurable! It is hoped that other universities, middle schools, and primary schools can follow suit and set up more free places and expand the effect of scholarship assistance. Our colleagues often optimistically believe that the future of the nation and the nation is deeply dependent!</p>
<p>Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory Enthusiastically Helps Students</p>
<p>Bayer Pharmaceutical Company wrote: "Previously, on August 17, we sent a draft and donated 100,000 yuan to be divided equally between your newspaper and the News Daily Scholarship Fund, which we believe has been noted. Currently, the economic situation is deteriorating day by day, and the threat to students' education is even greater. The next semester will begin soon before the lunar New Year. Our company always takes the happiness of the Chinese people to heart, and especially tries to manage it, donating 200,000 yuan, to be divided equally between your newspaper and the News Daily Scholarship Fund. A check for 100,000 yuan is attached, please check and receive it, but state that it is only for students in the medical field. We admire your newspaper's selfless spirit, and dare to wish you a complete success, so as to repay your newspaper's efforts.</p>
<p>The High Moral Character of Foreign Merchants in Helping Students Is Commendable</p>
<p>Lu Meizeng, a giant in the advertising industry, wrote: "To whom it may concern, I am enclosing a check for 100,000 yuan for the medical student scholarship from Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory of Germany, along with the original English letter. Please check. For decades, the factory has been extremely concerned about charitable undertakings in our country's society and has provided much assistance, either in the form of money and medicine, or in the form of advertising publications, all of which are generously contributed. Today, there are very few foreign merchants in Shanghai who can benefit Chinese students. The spirit of the factory's willingness to do what is right is admirable. The current General Manager, Mr. W. Berchtle, has not been in China for long, but he expresses his sympathy for the scholarship assistance. Two weeks ago, he had the joy of having a son, and personally donated an additional 50,000 yuan to your newspaper's scholarship fund, which is enclosed with this letter. I hope you will publish it, and I will be extremely grateful."</p>
<p>Furen Middle School Teachers and Students Raise Funds</p>
<p>The Furen Middle School Poor Student Scholarship Committee wrote: "To whom it may concern, your newspaper advocates scholarships to help young students avoid dropping out of school. Over the years, you have worked hard and achieved remarkable results, and your reputation has spread far and wide, admired not only by colleagues in the education community. However, in recent months, prices have risen endlessly, and it is expected that the number of dropouts in the next semester will increase dramatically, while scholarship agencies in various places will have to allocate funds to the original number of students. Witnessing the group that previously struggled to support themselves and did not request assistance will now have no way to appeal and will be wandering down the wrong path, our school's teachers and students have initiated a poor student scholarship campaign to help new and old students in our school who are poor and have not received assistance from other places in the next semester. This week, we have been promoting it unanimously and have received the support of enthusiastic people in the community and enlightened parents. As of yesterday, we have received 1.5 million yuan in cash, and we are donating a portion of it to Shenbao and Xinbao, distributed according to the proportion of students receiving assistance in the school. The small amount is insignificant and is only a small contribution. Teacher representative Zhu Kongrong and student representative Qiu Jinyu are personally presenting a check for 40,000 yuan, along with a list, please check and receive it."</p>
<p>Scholarships Received Yesterday: Zhang Da 5,000 yuan, Lilv Shi 3,500 yuan, Songhe, Tang Chengzhang combined 3,000 yuan, Shou Shan Printing Department (delivered by Zhao Zengkui) 2,500 yuan, Jiaodian San Yi 1,800 yuan, Chen Dingwei 1,200 yuan, Anonymous (delivered by Pu Qiting) Shen Jun, Lu Jia Yuantang, Zhang Jun, Zhu Jinjian each 1,000 yuan, Xu Tiquan from Nanjing (to celebrate the birthday of cousin Zhang Yongxu and his wife), Zhou Qiutao each 500 yuan, Li Yixin, Ying Yongyu (Lin Kanghou's son's wedding) each 200 yuan.

Recently, friends from all walks of life have entrusted new students to apply, but in fact, it is impossible to comply. In addition to answering directly, I hope you will understand.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Several Methods for Rescuing Students from Dropping Out <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qikun</p>
<p>The increase in tuition fees and the number of young people dropping out of school are increasing in the same direction, which is an inevitable fact. The serious consequences of this have been discussed in great detail in recent issues of the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers. I hereby offer my humble opinion on methods for rescuing students from dropping out:</p>
<p>(1) Postage Surcharge: The Education Bureau should consult with the Postal Administration to collect an educational assistance donation of 50% (for example) on the delivery of letters and packages. The amount is small and will not affect the future of the postal service, and the people will surely be happy to comply. The method does not require issuing new stamps, but only adding the words "Educational Assistance Donation Paid" in blue ink to the existing stamps. For convenience, the implementation of this method can be limited to the Shanghai area only. If implemented for one month, the amount collected will be considerable, and the number of young people dropping out of school will be greatly reduced as a result.</p>
<p>(2) Free and Half-Price School Places: The Education Bureau should issue an order to all schools to add a certain number of free and half-price school places (the number to be determined by a special committee of the Education Bureau, depending on the financial situation of each school). The selection of free and half-price students should be based on the schools' own assessment, but subject to review by the Education Bureau to prevent abuses. Those with poor performance or those who are outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant will be given warnings or other penalties, depending on the severity of the circumstances. Conversely, they will be commended.</p>
<p>(3) Encourage University and Middle School Students to Open Free Schools: It is not uncommon for university and middle school students in Shanghai to establish free schools in their spare time. If they are further organized and encouraged, the results may not be inferior to those of ordinary schools, and it will also benefit the popularization of education.

<h3 id="e40">Issues Regarding Class Attendance During Air Raid Alarms <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>A. School Side: (1) Normal Times: 1. Class Time: From 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM. In this way, students can get up at 7:00 AM, and still have several hours after returning home in the afternoon to complete their homework. This will not increase the time students' families need to use lights, so it will not interfere with electricity conservation. 2. Rest Days: Every Sunday is a rest day, and classes are held all day on the remaining days (this point has already been implemented in several schools).</p>
<p>The above two points may be excepted in schools under special circumstances.</p>
<p>(2) When an Alarm is Issued: 1. Alert Alarm: Continue classes. 2. Air Raid Alarm: Immediately stop classes, and teachers should lead students to a safer place in the school to take shelter. At this time, students should absolutely obey the orders of their teachers. 3. Any student who is absent will not be marked as absent, and the same applies to late arrivals.</p>
<p>The above two points are exceptions under training alarms (second and third).</p>
<p>B. Student Side: (1) Normal Times: Follow school rules. (2) When an Alarm is Issued: 1. Alert Alarm: Those who have not departed should wait at home for a while, and if there are no other changes, then go to school. Those who have departed and are on the way should continue. Those who have arrived at school should attend classes at school. 2. Air Raid Alarm: Those who have not departed do not need to go to school. Those on the way should enter a shelter or a relative's home. Those who have arrived at school should follow the teacher's instructions.</p>
<p>The above two points are exceptions under training alarms.</p>
<p>If the alarm is issued at dismissal time: (1) The school should order each student to return home quickly if they live nearby, and those who live far away should stay at school. If those who live nearby disregard the order and return home, they should also stay at school. (2) Those who are on the way and live near the school should return to the school or enter a nearby shelter or relative's home.</p>
<p>In addition, schools must train students in air defense knowledge, especially in adapting to changing situations. As for the missed classes, they will be made up on Sundays or holidays. Are the above points agreeable to the school authorities? (Zhu Lianggou)</p>

<p>The Poor Relief Fund is the sixth service of this organization, aimed at helping the hidden poor, the extremely poor, the elderly, and the widowed to avoid freezing and starvation.</p>
<p>Donating to the Poor Relief Fund is a human spirit of mutual assistance and a virtuous act.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Free Schools and Educational Assistance <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Sino-Western Piano Scholarship: The Sino-Western Girls' School has a piano scholarship, and new students are tested once every semester. The sixth session is scheduled to be held on the 20th of this month (Saturday). The program is still limited to intermediate level and below. Anyone with musical talent can apply for the exam at the school at 425 Huashan Road (formerly Haige Road). The scholarships are divided into honorary and poverty types. Those with poverty scholarships who perform well in the exam are completely free, and those with second-class performance are half-free.</p>
<p>Hehai Engineering College: Nantong Private Hehai Engineering College was established by the Dasheng Textile Company with funds allocated to inherit the late Mr. Zhang's will. The school is located in Tangjiazha, Nantong. It opened last autumn, and the program follows university standards and adopts a strict system. There is currently one class of regular students. It is planned to recruit transfer students during the winter vacation. The school only charges 2,000 yuan per semester, and part of the food expenses are subsidized by the school. No accommodation fees, miscellaneous fees, or other fees are charged. Books and instruments are borrowed from the school. There are also scholarship and financial aid quotas. Those interested in studying in Nantong can request chapters and register at 1726 Taishan Road (intersection of Wuxing Road) in the Tonghai River Water Conservancy Engineering Committee in this city.</p>
<p>Nianci Free Elementary School: Established for many years, it strives to cultivate outstanding poor students. Mr. Li Duanxiao Bao, the chairman of the school board, recently noticed that the number of scholarships provided by the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers is insufficient, and there are more monks than porridge. Therefore, he has set up free school places, charging only 1,500 yuan for miscellaneous fees. Registration starts today, and the exam will be held on the 22nd. School address: Intersection of Lin Yin Road on Fang Xie Road, West Gate.</p>
<p>Daxiong Free Night School: The classes are divided into three levels, roughly equivalent to the first, second, and third grades of junior high school.

Only a deposit of 500 yuan is charged, which will be refunded at the end of the term. Tuition and miscellaneous fees are completely free, and there are scholarships, diligence awards, job introductions, and various competitions. School address: Shangqing Middle School, 3 Lane 60, Qingdao Road.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Donating Works to Help the Poor <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Cao Renlin wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, this year's winter is extraordinarily cold, and I have witnessed many disaster victims dying on the streets, which is a shocking sight. Feeling compassionate, but lacking the means to help. I hereby respectfully submit three of my works, 'Star Degree Guide,' 'Qimen Interpretation,' and 'Renxue Shugu,' 30 copies of each, for your appraisal and charity sale, and the entire proceeds will be used to help the poor. This humble intention, I respectfully ask for your consideration." (Note: After evaluation, the prices are set at 500 yuan per copy for "Star Degree Guide" and "Qimen Interpretation," and 300 yuan per copy for "Renxue Shugu.")</p>
<h3 id="e46">Children's Library Sees a Sharp Increase in the Number of Readers <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Library provides free access to excellent reading materials for children throughout the city. At a time when book prices are soaring, readers are even more enthusiastic, even on snowy days. The library had a total of 121,454 visitors last year. In addition, there were 24,148 group book loans and 16,280 mobile library visits, for a total of 161,882 people throughout the year. It is also reported that the library recently received a donation of 10,000 yuan from Mr. Shen Siliang, the president of St. John's University, and 20,000 yuan from Ying Yongyu, which will be used to purchase new books to increase children's reading interest.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Financial Institutions Establish a Loan Office for Staff <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The banking community in this city, in view of the extraordinary times and rising prices, and the fact that employees of industrial and commercial organizations rely solely on fixed salaries to maintain their livelihoods, already feel very constrained. If they encounter urgent needs, they will find it even more difficult to raise funds. Therefore, 14 banks initiated and agreed to collect 60 million yuan to provide low-interest loans to help those in urgent need. The first step is to target employees of industrial and commercial organizations organized as companies, and it is named the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Staff Loan Office. The office is located at 526 Jing'an Temple Road (side door inside the Chengdu Road intersection). All loan procedures are now prepared, and applications will be accepted from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily starting on the 15th. Employees of financial and industrial and commercial organizations organized as companies in the old 18 and 2 districts of this city and the Nanshi Zhabei area who have special needs in their lives can apply for loans from the office.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Fu You Orphanage Makes an Urgent Appeal, Hoping for Generous Donations from All Sectors <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fu You Orphanage has been in operation for three years and has a large scale, specializing in accommodating and educating street children and orphans. In addition to introducing graduates to work in the city's industrial and commercial sectors, there are currently more than 300 children still being cared for. The teaching and management are serious, and the results are remarkable. However, the orphanage has no endowment and relies on social donations for all its expenses. At a time when everything is soaring in price, the orphanage's finances are in dire straits. If assistance is not provided quickly, the livelihoods of hundreds of children being cared for in the orphanage will inevitably become unimaginable. Therefore, from the 6th of this month, the fourth donation drive will aim to raise 10,000,000 yuan. It is hoped that people with goodwill from all sectors will donate generously and continuously so that the orphanage's relief work can continue. Then, the merits of the donors will be immeasurable. All donations from all sectors, in addition to being sent directly to the orphanage's office at Room 432, 4th Floor, Cishu Building, Nanjing Road, can also be collected and remitted by this office.</p>
