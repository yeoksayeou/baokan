<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日衆議院二十二日舉行預算總會時，安藤正純氏曾質問政府，對呂朱島之決戰中所佔地位抱如何見解，當由小磯首相答辯稱：將來之戰局固不能預料，然菲律賓前綫我軍將兵士氣極爲軒昂旺盛，尤以最近敵方逡巡蠢動，余確告我軍將兵必能善謀勇戰，殲滅敵軍，而便戰局有利進展。關於菲律賓週圍之作戰，對將來之戰局及我國國力影響如何，於此無須余再贅言，各位常已盡知，總之，對此戰局之推移，有莫大之期待與希望。</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日衆院豫算總會，自二十二日起舉行，速日眞摯之審議，大體在二十六日總會即可閉幕。又二十八·九兩日之分科會中，質問了結後，當於三十日提交全體會議，予以通過。又在此期間內，新政府若提出臨時軍事費追加案，則預定當即加以審議，並即日通過，送交全體會議，且決舉全力協力澦算之施行。</p>
<p>增强航空戰力</p>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　船田中氏，二十三日曾於衆院豫算總會席上，就擴充航空戰力問題提出質問，當由吉田軍需相答謂：於今日戰局下，生產所需要之飛機，由於資源關係，固爲一極困難之問題，然昭和十九年（民國三十三年）已較十六年增加甚多。前綫急切需要飛機，同時後方製造方面，亦不拘於過去之計劃，正努力趕製。爲補足前綫將兵之需要，雖在空襲下，仍不分畫夜繼續奮鬥。余認在運輸與勞務方面，吾人尚有努力餘地，關於生產數量具體數字雖不能奉告，然製造之上昇綫，則遠超過敵美，問題唯在今後如何保持此上昇綫之續行向上，余認必須將一切軍需生產總力集中於增强航空戰力一點，以促其實現。</p>

<p>東京二十三日中央社電　重光外相於二十三日預算總會中，答覆中谷氏之質問，闡明對中。日全面和平政府應有之强力援助及信念，其要旨如次：「大東亞宣言之精神，乃爲澈底使東亞歸復於東亞人之手，則東亞方得安定，但重慶實因有美國駐在之軍事上及政治上之勢力所致，從中妨書，故破除敵美之侵略勢力，乃爲至要且急者，但重慶之事，當視作一國內問題，由中國人率先處理，實爲理所當然，帝國則始終基於大東亞宣言之本旨，以期有成。在故主席乃爲繼國父孫文之遣志，而倡導大亞細亞主義者，國民政府成立之初，力主全面和平，而欲達成國父未竟之志，陳代主席亦深明大義，出而拯救中國當前之危局，帝國對此當予以全力之援助云云。</p>

<p>東京二十三日中央社電　二十二日預算總會之質問中，安藤正純氏言及美機濫炸神宮之不法行爲，並作沉痛談話如下：伊勢神宮域及其附近地區，無軍事及生產之設施，乃爲顯然之事。敵機於事先想必早由上空偵察，自能充分明瞭，不料仍向神宮施炸，此種殘暴行爲，人神均所不允，尤爲一億國民所憤恨切齒。敵機污辱此國民尊崇之神宮，日本國民非特不稍喪其完遂聖戰之初衷，反爲激昂戰意，益堅敵愾同仇之決心。政府與國民對此不法暴行，當以神靈之犧牲，即我之犧牲，均必堅定戰爭必勝之決心，非斷然擊滅仇敵不可。</p>

<p>東京二十三日中央社電　素稱物量龐大之敵，因補給困難，已感物資不足，並因戰爭目的不正及精神信任之薄弱，敵恐惶益劇。此外敵所最恐懼者，則爲日軍之勇敢精神，此事實由日前來襲某地時被日軍擊落之敵機航本人員屍體中發見之日記所記載者，即可知悉。其日記中有謂：「某月某日恐怖之日軍機隊，今日又飛來，因日機連日來襲，吾等均感睡眠不足，現今即聞日方機聲，精神爲之錯感」。其恐懼慌張之狀態如此。又某月某日，日軍編成特攻之航空隊，昨日曾於雷伊泰島方面及蘇魯海方面擊沉美空母，據云日軍此特攻隊，均一機換一艦，以拚撞方式，此種戰法，實爲全世界任何國家難有之戰術，談及特攻隊時，機員均爲之變色，故最近兵營內，己證實大爲恐懼特攻隊事實矣。</p>

<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>省政漸趨明朗</p>
<p>按過去的江蘇行政，頗有不能令人滿意的地方，這是無庸諱言的。究其因，雖稅情形至爲複雜，然曩昔軍政之不能統一，實爲重要之因素。中央爲剷除過去的障礙，且爲增行政效率起見，實施軍政一元化政策，並以蘇人治蘇，俾收事半功倍之效。故特調海長任援道氏執當蘇省軍政大權，因是氣象一新。任氏下車伊始，即宣佈其今後施政之三要點爲：尊重民意，肅淸貪污，及安定民生，皆屬切要，實亦民衆所渴望者。任氏履新以來，已逾兩月，在此期問，曾迎續召開縣政，保安，警察，敎育，建設諸會議，每次會議必親臨主持，其實幹與苦幹之精神，令人欽佩。此亦任氏勵精圖治，銳意革新之表現。記者留蘇時，曾晋謁任氏，承蒙見告數點：（一）茲值大東亞戰爭決勝年之際，江蘇爲後方重鎭，決站在國家與民族之立塲上，協同帮助盟邦，完成聖戰，取得最後之勝利。（二）江蘇今後施政，決依照國府已定國策，及汪故主席遺訓，務使江蘇省內澈底推行中央的政令。（三）注重精神建設，即使一班從政人員，決不因目前環境困難而灰心。應抱國父當年革命時百折不撓之精神，庶幾目前尚未賞現之全面和平，經吾人之努力，而後終有實現之一日。（四）本人以身作則，大公無私，省政工作人員，除辭職者外，一律舊人，且已提高其待遇，使其安心服務，爲民效勞，此點堪向江蘇之父老相告。總之，依記者之考察，應省行政已漸趨明朗化，實堪慶幸。</p>
<p>蘇垣之金融界</p>
<p>（一）銀行業事變前蘇州銀行共計十七家。以中國交通爲個中巨擘。按中國成立於民二，交通僅遲年餘。後起之秀之金城銀行，乃民二十年成立者。當時蘇州之銀行業極爲繁榮，堪稱該業之黃金時代。以金城爲例，二十六年秋季時，該行之定期存款，已達七八百萬元，佔全數存款額之十分之入强。迨至二十六年十一月十二日因軍事行動，蘇州銀行全體掩聲息鼓。直至二十八年冬，始有台灣銀行買辦周文瑞，籌炎創設蘇民銀行，規模較小，營業範圍，亦至有限。至三十年以環境之需要，始有多數之小銀行成立；此種小銀行資本薄弱，僅二三十萬元，主要業務爲高利放款。其組織類多不合政府之法定。茲政府爲强化金融起見，已於客歲十一月二十一日飭令各小銀行，增資至六百萬元。最近遵令增資者，已有長康，元裕等銀行。至新成立於去年之銀行，則有偉本，蔚大，惠民及由信記錢莊改組之民益數家。而資力雄厚之中，交，金三行經於三十二年時，先後恢復，目下蘇垣銀行，全體總計三十一家。除中儲，台灣，省立之江蘇地方，江蘇農民，半官式之華興外，餘皆爲商業化之組織。一般銀行之主要榮務，仍與戰前相仿，以放款爲主；所不同者，以往多係信用借款，今則有以絲綢等非統制品，向銀行作押款者。至以不動產抵押者，仍屬少數。至就銀行本身言，其存款定期者絕少，活存者以臨時性質，不能儘量利用，故頭寸時感缺乏。據業中人語，現下蘇州銀錢兩業之總籌碼，僅五萬萬元，無怪其常捉襟見肘矣。</p>
<p>（二）錢莊　戰前蘇州之錢莊計十二家。資本最大者，如晋生·保大亦僅四萬元。經戰事之打擊，全體倒閉。其主要之原因，乃以當時借與米行及綢緞莊（多數主顧係米綢業）之信甩放款困該業營業蕭條，不能收回，致促成全體總崩潰。目下事過境遷，則又如雨後春筍，先後成立者達八十二家。此種畸型繁榮，主要之因素不外一則以蘇垣四鄕治安欠佳，鄕間殷實富戶挾資來省，致使市面游資充斥。鄕俗之見，以辦銀行錢莊爲榮。故擁炎者皆願一嘗銀行或錢莊老闆之滋味。二則銀錢業雖說利潤較薄，但吃本亦輕，試察當此百物飛漲之火，且不談巨大之百貨公司，即開一規模略具之小烟紙店，亦非百萬金莫辦，而過去錢莊僅三五十萬元，即可成立，莫怪一般游資在握之輩，趨之若驚矣</p>
<p>現蘇州之銀錢業，各組有公會。錢業則又有錢莊準備庫，及自身之票據交換所，同時又加入銀行業方面組織之票據交換所。組織方面，較之舊有之票莊，已屬進步。惜其目光短淺，祇在圖利，對急不容緩之農貸，毫無貢獻。</p>
<p>大衆生活一般</p>
<p>蘇州的大衆生活，在物價屢漲的壓迫下，因難情形與滬地相伯仲。事實上所受痛苦，或更有甚於滬地者，即當地制服階級之拔扈是。强買之事，層出不窮。記者目睹在景德路長春醬園店，來一黃衣人，備「採辦」臂章，出資六百元，强購豆油四斤。初則店主請饒。終至屈服。而黃衣人於盛氣之後長揚而去。商民則敢怒而不敢言，記者離蘇之日，省當局已出示嚴禁，商民稱慶，但未卜其效果如何耳。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c10">論日本本屆戰塲議會 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>日本第八十六屆議會，即所謂「戰塲議會」，目去冬十二月二十七日暫告休會後，業於本月二十一日起繼續再開。當此大東亞戰爭決戰之際，本屆議會乃更爲各方面所注目。特別重大的任務，首先是適應決戰新局面的完成國內決戰體制，其次就是新戰局下日本的外交，尤其是中日更進一步的協力，茲願就此二者，稍抒所見，以期兩國有識人士之注意與勉力。</p>
<p>關於日本國內決戰體制之完成工作，近來已有新的進展，這裏特別值得注目，而與本屆議會之審議有莫大期待的，是下列三點：</p>
<p>第一，日本政府於本月十二日閣議席上，曾公布迅速實踐新規定之緊急決戰施策五項，並對於以翼政會爲中心之新國民組織案再作檢討。爲了確立强力政治態熱以爭收大東亞戰爭勝利，翼政會「必勝國民態勢確立特別委員會」，已於十七日上午的大會中，通過了「樹立舉國的新黨」這一劃期的議案，是準備更有效的動員民衆力量協力政府完遂戰爭，這一點對於本屆議會之成案，有很重大的期待。</p>
<p>第二，本屆議會討諭的中心，是適應決戰現階段急要的各項議案，特別是政府對貴衆兩院提出的法律案二十七件，如恩給法，兵役法，陸軍軍法會議法，海軍軍法會議法中之改正案，現役靑年學校職員俸給費補助法，戰時金融調整法等等。而爲增加國庫收入吸收購買力而提出的十九億元增稅案，二百二十二億餘元之一般社會預算案，乃至特急追加預算案，臨時軍費等，都將在木屆議會中發揮一億一心的「特攻精神」。</p>
<p>第三，小磯首相於二十一日在議會中發表施政演說，對於（一）增强防空體制，（二）澈底增强軍需增產，（三）竭力增產食糧，並强化自給體制，（四）增强勤勞體制及國民勞動動員，（五）澈底使所有物質化爲戰力，都有剴切的說明，此外對於疏散大都市人口，促進建造新船，軍官民一體負起衛國重任，以及加强大東亞各國團結，都足以說明日本結集總力，堅定信念，完遂戰爭的政治方針。議會未來的成就，必有不可限量者。</p>
<p>關於日本對大東亞各國尤其是對華關係，也成爲這次日本議會中受各方面所注目的一端。小磯首相於强調指出大東亞各國加强團結之外，施政演說中曾申述「支援大陸方面之生產」及「力謀日滿華間大陸運輸力之增强」的大陸政策方針。重光外相的演說中，也明白指示決從政治經濟兩方面徹底的實踐中日協力，協助新興中國的建設。這種懇摯的表示，在我國朝野，當然更爲重視。</p>
<p>我國參戰以來，兩國友好關係雖在進展之中，然而雙方之理想及實際所表現者如何，仍不免有值得深思熟慮之處。我們對於日本這次議會中關於我國問題之注視與討論，不能不存熟烈的期待。</p>
<p>重光外相於二十一日答覆金光庸夫氏之質問時。力言改善中國之窮困問題，刻正攷慮新經濟政策。我們雖未見重光外相對於這種新政策的具體內容有所說明，但昨（二十三日）大陸新報載東京電話中則表示爲：（一）資源戰力化之合理的運營，（二）通貨膨脹之對策及（三）運輸力之確保。這裏已可明顯看出，盟邦熟烈希望我們克盡協力完遂戰爭的任務。加連建設新興的中隊。</p>
<p>我們站在中國人民的立塲，就參戰以來感受最深者而言，當亦莫過於資源，通貨與運輸諸問題，但吾人更深知凡此各項問題，其癥結厥在農工生產之停滯凋零及政治力量的不足以克服種種困難。環顧今日中國，誠所謂「危機四伏」，所以我們今日必須向盟邦朝野及中國當局獻言者，所謂「中國資源戰力化」，所謂「對華新經濟政策」之內容，其成功之唯一要義，即在挽救今日中國貧困衰落之現象，必須從協助增加生產入手，然後才談得到眞正的集結戰力，協力完遂戰爭。不過，欲期增產，獲致實現，對於過去反使生產萎縮的病態，自須坦白檢討。我們認爲增加生產的直接間接工作，以由中國人士自動辦理，日本人士處於協助地位，比較切合環境。我們於自勉之餘，更對盟邦木屆議會寄予摯誠的期待。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　海通社訊，美方廣播：莫斯科眞理報承認東普魯士之德軍堅强防綫，予蘇軍以極大困難，爲欲推進，蘇軍須時常突破鋼骨水泥之工程，通過一公里之砲壘後面，尚有第二第三第四之道防綫，德軍抵抗極爲堅强，以大批坦克車及移動大砲向蘇軍反攻。</p>
<p>德軍戰報</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　德元首行營二十二日發表；諾維埃茲與克拉科中間戰綫，刻於山岳地帶展開熾烈防禦戰。德軍於西里西亞，强化工業地區東部及東北方戰綫，並於坎本（Kempen）西方强化防地，以上兩地區之德軍有力部隊之攻擊，已　完成防禦形勢。俄伯痕（Oppeln）東方戰綫經激戰後，蘇軍已獲進展。羅茲（Lodz）西南及卡里茲（Kalicz）托倫（Torun）中間戰機，刻已展開激戰。蘇軍由東普魯士西南部向北之壓迫，巳形增大，蘇軍於東普魯士東部之攻擊，已擴至羅明頓草地（Rominten　Heatli）南方，蘇軍於費里博夫及印斯特堡問之攻擊已悉失敗，以上作戰，俊德軍第六十一步兵師即已擊毀蘇戰車二十五輛，蘇軍已於印期特堡（Intereberg）與寇里希（Kurischer）中間突破德軍防禦錢，刻展開熾烈之戰鬥。</p>
<p>蘇軍攻勢四大目標</p>
<p>柏林二十三中日央社電　海通社訊：德軍事發言人指陳，蘇聯冬季攻勢主要之突擊目標有四：一爲向布萊斯勞（Breslau）進攻，深入西里西亞。二爲向波森（Plsen）與布朗堡（Branderburg）進襲。三爲向埃爾平（Elbing）進迫。四爲向康尼斯堡（Konisberg）進取。據軍在工業區之東郊及東北郊，與坎本迤西增築防禦工程，連成一綫</p>
<p>德防禦戰獲到成功</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社訊，德軍界負責方面昨晚稱：德軍在上西里西亞邊界實施對策，此爲自蘇軍開始攻勢以來之首次。關於昨日德軍戰報中所稱德軍在上西里西亞防禦之成功，該方面稱，德軍司令部之目的，在放棄最少之領土而取得最大之軍事效果，蘇軍被目阻達到其攻勢最重要標，此點甚爲重要。德軍之任務，在以堅强防綫，保護上西里西亞工業區，同時粉碎蘇軍自南進抵但澤鰱而陷東普魯士於孤立之計劃。此項任務之實施，必須犧牲若干土地，此項階段雖尚未結束，但證之於上西里西亞與東普魯士南疆之戰事，蘇軍之進展巳遭部份退阻，德軍防禦戰之成功，被認爲德軍防綫凝固點之開始。</p>
<p>洪境德軍反攻奏捷</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：德裝甲部隊及步兵以旋風之勢，突入斯托維森堡，現正於城北數公里處，追擊敵軍。自蘇軍於普拉登湖突入洪京南之多瑙河後，此乃德軍之第二次大勝。蘇聯圖以步兵三十師·砲兵三師·坦克七旅·高射砲一師，向維也納猛撲未逞，德軍于一月十九日先行發動攻勢　蘇軍之計劃遂被擊破。普拉登湖北端與斯托維森堡間之每一村落，已由蘇軍政爲要塞，故德軍進攻之時，曾遭遇强烈抵抗。當德軍攻克第一道防綫時，德與敵兵死亡之比約一百〇一與二十至五十之比，蘇軍敗退時情景之慘，不亞於一九四〇年法國之戰役。德軍平射砲及高射砲旁彈壳堆積之多，可以想見其抵抗之激烈。</p>

<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　德國社訊軍息：德軍在佛日山區之攻勢中，已於星期一日穿入哈根諾</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：西綫戰事現已進入居間階段，美軍大舉進攻亜登，自星期五以來已見鬆弛，故該處現僅有局部激戰。英美蘇願有一種諒解，在東西兩綫同時發動攻勢，今則在蘇軍猛攻東綫之時，艾森霍華之進攻突告停頓，此皆由倫台特攻勢推翻英美軍計劃所奏之功也。艾森霍華在目前當將在軍事及政治方面準備一切，以便在西綫發動新攻勢，果爾，則目前尚在整理其第一軍及第三軍。數日前已見巴頓將軍之軍隊撤離亞登，調往薩爾及比許迤南，作局部進攻，目前英第二軍在羅爾繆斯三角地內之進攻，雖僅有兵力五師，似亦爲艾森霍華新攻勢之準備措施。</p>

<h3 id="c26">讀周兼市長吿市民書 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣先啓</p>
<p>一月十五日，是上海周兼市長及其高級幹部就職的良辰，我雖無　被邀參加盛典，可是爲表示衷心的祝賀，也於當日上午十一時跑到市政府去，不過終爲警戒兵所阻，無法見到受賀的新任長官，只是懷着一份「告市民書」回去。</p>
<p>「告市民書」的首段是簡略的說明上海目前形勢的複雜，嚴重，和惑劣，以及周先生來担任市長的經過，周先生告訴我們：在陳代主席有意將上海的事屬意於他後，曾有許多朋友勸告他顧念今後上海環境的困難，不必身任其難，白白的來作犧牲；可是他堅定認爲：在這種非常時期不能爲個人打算，而終於在陳代主席的令囑和同志們的敦促下毅然把重担挑起來了！我記得汪先生曾說過「和平運動是入地獄，跳火坑的工作」，在时局如此嚴重，環境如此困難之下周先生來兼長滬市，當然也是抱着「我不入地獄誰入地獄，我不跳火坑誰跳火坑」的決心！</p>
<p>誠然，「這樣的時局，這樣的環境，就是三頭六臂的天神下凡，也決不會有辦法打開僵局，改善現狀的」，上海己像「病入膏育」的病人一樣，積年的病菌，已經深入心臟，再加上外來的感冒，更使病勢沉重；然而這位病人還不曾死，這病人更死不得，所以我們在沒有辦法的情勢下要想辦法救活它，西醫不靈改用中醫，針藥無効再服水藥，跌打損傷的膏藥敷起來，補中益氣的補丸吃下去，有了周兼市長這樣極公正很精細的名醫，再加上羅君强先生這樣有魄力有生氣，說幹就幹的「鐵腕助手」，要開刀的開刀，要注射的注射，我想上海是救得活的，上海是有辦法的！</p>
<p>中國政治無法上軌道的病源一言以蔽之曰「自私自利」，因爲有「私」所以才會「亂」，也因爲「亂」，人民才會「苦」；現在周兼市長已向大家保障他和他的幹部都是壯年有爲，有理想，有事業心的，他們是抱了很大的決心來「想做好」，他們的精神是「公益重於私利，社會先於個人」，他們更切言：「絕對不會利用職權和地位去謀個人的私利」，他們「決心以身作則，不貪贓，不枉法，不舞弊營私，不巧取豪奪」。這種幹法是深明中國政治以往的積弊，這種宣告，也是針對着中國社會的病源。以往，一直到現在，在上者確有許多不能以身作則的，「只許州官放火，不許百姓點燈」，「只顧個人享樂，不顧小民死活」，利用職位來營私舞弊，欺壓小民的更是司空見慣，不勝枚舉。周兼市長透識世情，飽經患難，在就任的時候旣能如此負責向市民保證，我想一定可以在生活煎逼，人欲橫洗的腐敗墮落社會中樹立廉潔的風氣。</p>
<p>周兼市長就職的次日，我從南外灘乘電車到福開森路，耳聞「小市民」的閒談很多。這兩天似乎各處都在注意市府新長官就任的事情，米價下跌，物價止漲，這是說明在惡劣的社會環境中還怕正義的制裁，電車上的一位北方人說；「周市長以後對貪汚的官吏是絕對不會含糊的，在他就職的前一天，特別拉出他所屬的一位監政局的局長來槍斃，這就赴他向後之貪汚者示威！」另一位乘客說：「可不是嗎？羅秘書長在安徽的幹法也够勁！　說他的一位隊長打了郵局的職員，他便馬上將這位隊長拿去槍斃，以後上海這班背檐穿制服的人也得留心一點！」</p>
<p>又在另外一個塲合，似乎有人在議諭羅先生的談話：有一位太太說：「傳說以後警察的待遇要提高幾倍，但是生活能維持以後就不許敲詐老百姓了，老的壞的警察都要淘汰，全要靑年和壯年，一般公務人員也要使他們能生活，誰貪污就有殺頭的危險！」</p>
<p>——這是眞正市民的呼聲！</p>
<p>——道是眞正市民的期待！</p>
<p>旅行通訊</p>
<h3 id="c27">京滬道中速寫 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者澹明</p>
<p>火車票漲價了。在政府當局正企圖壓平物價的時候，火車的票價竟漲了十四成，以國營公用事業的資格而尙不能不隨物價影響，我們也可以知道今日中國民生艱苦的程度了。聽說當國府建設部當局批准華中鐵道此次加價要求時，曾以華鐵設法改善營業現况爲條件。所以記者雖然對以前旅途的艱苦可以加以沉默，但在華鐵加價實行之後，再踏上這條宛若魔道一般的征途時，便很想據實向讀者報道一番。</p>
<p>黑市票未消滅</p>
<p>夜車向來是被稱爲「單帮列車」的，如果我要調查車站黑幕的眞相，這倒是一個很好的嘗試。乘火車，第一個難關便是買票，當記者每次傍晚坐電車經過八仙橋　到旅行社門前已有人携帶棉被澦備守候過夜而一早買票的情景，眞是不禁白感交集！「難道仍舊有黑市買嗎」？我私自默想着。走進旅行社去買票，我幸而有幾位熟識的職員，所以沒有買黑市票，但是因爲換票的關係，結果算起來也吃虧了五百塊錢。買好了票，爲了要看一位朋友走進了他的辦公室，只聽見有一個僕人正在打電話：</p>
<p>「票沒有買到，因爲哈同大樓的一處專賣黑市票地方已被封了。」</p>
<p>『那末，想想辦法。」</p>
<p>話到這裏，那個僕人就匆匆走出門去，不久他又回來在聽筒機上繼續發言：</p>
<p>「有是有辦法的，但是要賣三千塊錢哩！」</p>
<p>聽到這裏，我禁不住問他：「到什麼地方要三千塊錢？』他說：『到無錫的一張三等票。」「黑市票在什麽地方買呢？」我問：</p>
<p>「现在買黑市票很困難，」他回答我：「祗有華鐵方面的人，暗中托熟識的人在兜售，如果你不認識這個人，你便沒有法子買到。」</p>
<p>華鐵當局最近在整頓業務，在這裏已獲到了證據，可是要根本消滅黑市票，單靠車站方面的努力顯然不够的。因爲等到記者入站後問問同行的，雖然買黑市票的已不多，但也非絕對沒有。現在到南京的二等車票黑市價已近七八千元，試問如果黑市票價不消滅，此次華鐵加價的意義豈非反而助長了黑市的漲風？尤其據說因了這種漲風，便是上海的米價在這幾天丙又見回漲！</p>
<p>軋票前的風景</p>
<p>乘火車第二個難關是軋票，普通軋票總在火車啓行前半小時，但是因爲坐夜車的綠故，如果你不擠在前面就無法覓得坐位，一夜不睡猶可，一夜直立恐無法支持了。所以一般旅客莫不儘早到站，大概自上海到南京的夜車雖要到十點零五分啓行，七時左右已有旅客到站排隊了。記者已坐過好幾次夜車，所以經騐也很豐富，在十九日晚間七時即從家中動身，坐了三輪車到站。到站時還未滿八點鐘，但在頭二等軋票處早已人頭擠擠了。我於是排在頭二等公務員軋票處，因爲無聊就和一同排隊的人談談出門經。據有幾位時常往返於滬蚌間的人說：「以前炸埠車站是頂混亂不過的，但是自從羅前省長主政之後，秉着亂世用重刑的精神，居然現在已大非昔比了。」所以他們希望羅氏來滬任市府秘書長後，能有同樣的成績。滬站現已設有警察分局，對一切舞弊的人或者不久可有非常的處置吧！</p>
<p>站上兜售黑市票的情形，因爲賣票處在站外沒有能够親眼見到，可是黑帽子問「單帮」要買路綫却曾映入我的眼簾。當記者立着排隊時，一陣喧譁，但見有五位鄕人模樣而背負着貨物的人，被盟邦憲兵鞭撻着逐出站台。原來他們先曾在黑帽子地方化過每人五百元的，所以先進了站合，不料遇見了憲兵，又被趕了回來。好容易等憲兵走去了，他們才再從黑帽子那裏倫倫地走入站台。他們是乘到常州去的慢車的。</p>
<p>京滬一帶人民莫不早知「黑帽子」大名的，提到了沒有人不心跳。因此記者今天特別把他們看個仔細，原來就是華鐵的職工，有的臂上套着寫「案内」字樣的臂布條。看起來倒並不面目可憎，可是一到了佒要軋票的時候，他們的威風確屬可驚。他們可以隨意向排着隊的三等旅客要錢，他們也可以「黄魚頭」的滿足而啓开軋票處的鐵桿，請施主們走入站台，再把排隊地方的軋票處鐵桿啓開，向排隊的旅客發令退後，讓那批施主們擠在前面。因此秩序亂起來了，後來的旅客又不住向前擁擠，於是惹動了盟邦站員，不得不站在牆頭高高地指揮黑帽子用鞭子維持秩序。這時的黑帽子眞所謂威風凜凜，好像劊子手一般，手起鞭落，滿塲弄得婦哭孩啼，實在慘不忍覩。</p>
<p>「好忍心呀，他們怎麼下得落手的呢？」有人便在那裏議論紛紛。</p>
<p>車中閑談單帮</p>
<p>鈴聲響處，軋票員剪票的時候可算是頂緊張的一幕，那時的擁擠情形更是難以盡述，尤其因爲我們站到九點半鐘時候，忽有慢車進站，公務員軋票處須讓開，以便公務員及盟邦軍人出站，所以原先排好的隊又擁擠得不像樣了。等到慢車旅客走完再行排隊，其秩序的混亂就可想而知。何况今天旅客特別擁擠，軋票時間已延長到九時五十五分，所以一般不知道火車何時開行的人，更是急得要爭先軋票了。好客易擠出了軋票處，記者只得快步飛奔，但是跑到首一節二等廂時，早見入口處的人己擠得水洩不通。幸而還有一節軍人二等車廂，有半節是旅客的，記者才佔坐了一席。不久排隊的人完全走上了車廂，可是一般婦孺大都沒有坐位，而且車廂內簡直再無挿足餘地了。記者旁邊坐着一位「單帮」。他身作短裝，頭戴絨帽，棉襖上且有補洞，一　而知是單帮了。我問他帶的是什麽？他說是香烟六十條。原來他所帶的不是配給烟，而是三六牌和別的次等貨。據說他每次赴京，除去二等車票還可賺進四千元。等到從京返滬時，他再帶猪肉或鷄，好的時候可以赚一二萬元。他本是工廠的工人，因爲工廠停工，不得不以此爲營生。不幸他買了一張從硤石到南京的聯票，沒有買快車票，後來碰到了查票被罰去了二千九百元。同時查票來的時候，華籍車長便高呼三等客人走過去，否則要罰二萬多元哩！記者想：華鐵旣然在提高票價，而又提高了罰款，不知對於旅客的舒適程度也顧到沒有？像今天的二等車廂竟擠得密無細縫，難道他們在售票時完全沒有限度嗎？如果售票數量隨黑市需求而增加，這還成什麽國營事業呢？</p>
<p>做單帮也不是容易的，記者因在車上無事，便和那些單帮談談。據說，他們所以買二等票有幾個原因：（一）可以避免從柵攔中走進車站，因爲在那柵欄入口就有一位警察要買路綫至少一百元，（二）可以避免在排隊時給臂纏「案內」的黑帽子搜括，假定他看你貨物多便要開一個「黃魚頭」，否則至少也要二百元；（三）可以避免軋票時給軋票員敲竹槓，至少也可以省去一百元或二百元；（四）可以避去在車上給華籍車長帶同黑帽子以及臂纏「警乘」的「黃帽子」的搜查敲詐。同時，在三等車裏，盟邦車長是不去查視的，可以儘可讓那批壤蛋作粜，而且有時到了其它小站還有莫名其妙的黑帽子上來搶東西及敲詐。因此，這位單帮告訴我說：「我寗願多化一千五百塊錢！」</p>
<p>出站時的緊張</p>
<p>在車內一宿無話，次晟九時半已抵下關車站。下車的時候，秩序又見紛亂起來，尤其在快近收票處的時候。現在車站上的撿查是取消了，但是收票員却代替了過去的檢查員向單帮收錢。只要你帶了很多東西，看上去有點像單帮的樣子，他就要一把拉住你要「罰款」，於是一面收票一面講斤頭，弄得南京站又熱鬧起來。自然還有警察也在帮同維持秩序，總之都是法幣作祟。記者出收票處時，幸而手中僅有公事袋一隻，所以並未留難。在進城的人力車上，行人冷落，空氣也比較淸靜了許多。</p>

<p>— 蘭言</p>
<p>在這戰爭緊要關頭，官民亟應打成一片，密切合作，方能增加力量，突破難關，我們看到在這人口五百萬而據全國政治經濟文化中心點的上海市，却沒有一個代表人民的機關，不無遺憾。另一方面說，要爭取民衆，必須實行親民政治，要實行親民政治，必須尊重民意，尊重民意之道，不外重視與論和設置民意機關。本市市長現由周佛海先生接任，對於市政，當然有一番刷新，我們亟盼能够成立一個全市人民的代表機關——市參議會。記得早於民國二十年，國民政府公布市參議會的組織法，但因種種緣故，各市遲遲未曾成立，但到今日，依然感到迫切需要。</p>
<p>無可否認的，在今日，官民間有許多隔閡的地方。當局發布一道法令，人民因不明當局的用意，甚至誤解當局的苦心，或者此項法令不盡合民間的一般風尚，以致人民雖不積極地反對，但消極地履行不力，這對於當局的施政一定促有阻碍。不久之前，市物品配給　舉辦存米登記，多數市民以爲這是當局强制收買的前奏，因此大都規避，前往登記者寥寥無幾，這是官民不能密切合作之故，要宮民打成一片，非要有一個人民的代表機關不可。</p>
<p>在工部局時代，納稅華人會倒可說是變相的市參議會，及至租界收回，該會隨之取銷。後來另外設立了一個市政諮詢委員會，該會雖也是市民的代表機關，但在實質上並非是市參議會，而該會在過去很有一些良好的建議，亦未見完全實現。</p>
<p>關於組織市參議會，筆者有三點管見：</p>
<p>第一，關於議員名額，假定本市人口五百萬，照組織法須有議員一百十人，這個數額是恰當的，現在事實上恐不能由市民直接選舉，也不妨由當局捲定，須網羅各界領袖，各種專家，及其有眞才實學高尚人格之入士担任。</p>
<p>第二，市參議會有議決一切市行政設施之權，但依目下情形，須特別注重（一）關於整理市財政收入，幕集市公債，及其他增加市民負担之事項；（二）關於市民生計及救濟事項；（三）關於促進市敎育及其他文化事項；（四）關於市預算決事項；（五）關於經營市公有財産及公有營業事項等。</p>
<p>第三，市參議會並非政府機府，乃屬人民團體，須立於超然之地位，力　一切形式及空泛。</p>
<p>我們以至誠之情，敬盼市參議會今日　生。</p>

<p>現代做人，不能獨善其身，尤不能只顧利巴而忘却公利。社會是整個的，倘便你一人大富大貴，窮奢極慾，而大衆生活艱苦，衣食不濟，形成貧富不均苦樂不勻的狀態，還成什麼社會？大衆陷於水深火熱的困境，而我逍遙作樂，優游　在，不表同情之心，不作互助之計；這種人簡直是冷血動物，我們就不信他有光明的前途。所以我們常奉勸現環境下一般大富大貴的人：對社會公益，多多贊助；對貧苦大衆，多多救濟；以盡人類至高無上的同情心理，即以助學運動而論，何嘗不是基於「互助」與「同情」的心理而推動的事業？故其成效如何，亦全看社會有力者對此心理的程度而定。木屆「特別勸募」的成績，說壞果然未必，說好也不過爾爾！現距各校開學，僅七入天時間，而捐款目標，相差尚遠，我們爲五千淸寒學子，不勝惶恐與焦慮！所望仁人君子，迅賜援手，慷慨解囊，功德无量！</p>

<h3 id="c51">一年來之宏仁醫院 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 王以敏</p>
<p>宏仁醫院在過去的一年中，不是初一愁米，便是十五愁煤，不是今日電力要剪綫；便是明日煤氣要斷火，其他送往迎來塡表呈報尙是餘事，結果弄得焦頭爛額，只好聽其自然，在這種困難情形下，總算用盡九牛二虎之力，掙扎了一年，在這一年中搶救了小性命三千三百六十九條，救治了住院的病人（開刀及不開刀）九千零三十九人，來往門診治病的四萬七千五百零三人，在馬路受傷二由警局送來的八百七十一人，申新兩報貨學金學生來院檢　者一千餘人，間接直接恊助聖約翰大學這就了醫生四十餘人，女護士十八人，這便是本院對於社會上的一點小貢獻。</p>
<p>三十三年得難關是逃過了，三十四年得厄運正不知可能倖免？今日醫院可說是到了山窮水盡的絕境，眞所謂欲關不得，欲開不能之槪。向之爲人解除疾病痛苦的，到了今天反而自身百病叢生，無可救藥，推其原因，不外金錢物力兩者作崇，醫院開門七件事，不外柴·米·油·鹽·藥品·水·電，前四者須有相當力方得從黑市　隨意購買，但醫院　生產者，而是消耗的機關，每日拿有限的收入去　無限的物價互相競賽，結果只有望洋興　而巳，至於煤氣水電則又是另一問題，年來煤斤缺乏，因之煤氣水電供量不足，醫院限度亦隨之日减，到了今天，許多重要工作早巳停頓，偶而爲之，則罰款重重。加之年來患病者人數日增，無法應付。這兩重壓力一日緊迫一日，叫醫院從那裏能喘得過氣來？若一旦不幸事件發生，受傷者蜂湧而來，祗能索醫院於枯魚之肆了。所以爲醫院本身計，最好關門坐吃，倒可苟延殘喘，維持一時。醫院爲社會而設，理該爲社會犧牲。本來社會不能沒有醫院，醫院亦不能離社會而生存，但這緊密的關係在這幾年來脫節，醫院繼續爲社會服務，而社會都爲其他重要問題忘懷了醫院。現在上海的醫院，動搖者不一而足，遭此大難，唯有希望政府能顧全病家的安全，顧到今後對醫院的需要，對水電調整重點配給諸問題，早定確切有效的優待辦法。</p>

<h3 id="e1">House Budget General Meeting: Japanese Prime Minister Answers Questions on War Situation; High Morale of Troops on the Philippine Front <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – During the general budget meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 22nd, Mr. Masazumi Ando questioned the government about its views on the decisive battle situation in Luzon. Prime Minister Koiso replied: "While the future course of the war cannot be predicted, the morale of our troops on the Philippine front is extremely high and vigorous. Especially in light of the enemy's recent hesitant movements, I have assured our troops that they will be able to skillfully plan and bravely fight, annihilate the enemy forces, and achieve a favorable advancement in the war situation. As for the impact of the operations around the Philippines on the future course of the war and our nation's strength, I need not elaborate further, as everyone is already fully aware. In short, we have great anticipation and hope for the development of this war situation."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The general budget meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives, which began on the 22nd, is proceeding with earnest deliberation, and is expected to conclude on the 26th. After the conclusion of questions in the subcommittee meetings on the 28th and 29th, the bill will be submitted to the plenary session for approval on the 30th. Furthermore, if the new government submits a temporary supplementary military expenditure bill during this period, it is expected that it will be immediately deliberated and passed on the same day, and submitted to the plenary session. A decision has been made to exert every effort to cooperate in the implementation of the budget.</p>
<p>Enhancing Air Combat Strength</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Mr. Tanaka Funada raised a question on the issue of expanding air combat strength at the House of Representatives budget meeting on the 23rd. Minister of Munitions Yoshida replied: "Under today's war situation, producing the required aircraft is indeed an extremely difficult problem due to resource constraints. However, the production in Showa 19 (1944) has increased significantly compared to Showa 16 (1941). The front lines urgently need aircraft, and at the same time, the manufacturing sector in the rear is not bound by past plans and is working hard to expedite production. To meet the needs of the soldiers on the front lines, we continue to fight day and night, even under air raids. I believe that we still have room for improvement in transportation and labor. While I cannot disclose specific figures for production quantity, the upward trend in manufacturing far exceeds that of the enemy United States. The only question is how to maintain this upward trend in the future. I believe that all military production efforts must be concentrated on enhancing air combat strength to achieve this goal."</p>
<h3 id="e2">Foreign Minister Clarifies Belief in Overall Sino-Japanese Peace; Full Support to the National Government <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, in response to Mr. Nakatani's question at the budget meeting on the 23rd, clarified the government's strong support and belief in overall peace between China and Japan. The main points are as follows: "The spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration is to thoroughly return East Asia to the hands of East Asians, so that East Asia can be stable. However, Chongqing is indeed obstructed by the military and political forces of the United States stationed there. Therefore, eliminating the aggressive forces of the enemy United States is of utmost importance and urgency. However, the matter of Chongqing should be regarded as a domestic issue, to be handled primarily by the Chinese themselves, which is only natural. The Empire will consistently base its efforts on the principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration, in the hope of achieving success. The late Chairman Wang Jingwei succeeded to the aspirations of Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, and advocated Pan-Asianism. At the beginning of the establishment of the National Government, he advocated overall peace and sought to accomplish the unfinished goals of the Father of the Nation. Chairman Chen Gongbo also deeply understood the righteous cause and emerged to save China from its current crisis. The Empire will provide full assistance to this endeavor."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Mr. Ando Delivers a Solemn Speech <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – During the questioning at the budget meeting on the 22nd, Mr. Masazumi Ando spoke of the illegal act of American aircraft indiscriminately bombing the Ise Grand Shrine and delivered a solemn speech as follows: "It is clear that the Ise Grand Shrine area and its vicinity have no military or production facilities. The enemy aircraft must have conducted aerial reconnaissance beforehand and fully understood this. Unexpectedly, they still bombed the shrine. This kind of barbaric act is unforgivable by both gods and humans and is deeply resented by all one hundred million citizens. The enemy aircraft's desecration of this revered shrine of the nation will not diminish the Japanese people's original intention to complete the holy war. Instead, it will arouse their fighting spirit and strengthen their determination to fight against the enemy with a common hatred. The government and the people must respond to this illegal and violent act, considering the sacrifice of the divine spirit as our own sacrifice. We must firmly resolve to win the war and resolutely destroy the enemy."</p>

<p>Hong Kong, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing-U.S. Air Force raided Hong Kong again on the 21st, indiscriminately bombing and strafing Chinese residential areas, killing and injuring over four thousand Chinese. Over 20 Chongqing-U.S. Air Force B-24 aircraft, taking off from the Kunming base, intruded into Hong Kong at approximately 3:45 AM on the 21st. Fearing Japanese military attacks, they blindly dropped bombs from above and then hastily fled.

<h3 id="e5">Japanese Special Attack Corps; Courageous Spirit; Instills Fear in Enemy Aircrews <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The enemy, known for its vast material resources, is experiencing shortages due to supply difficulties. Furthermore, due to the unjust nature of the war and the weakness of spiritual conviction, the enemy's fear is intensifying. In addition, what the enemy fears most is the courageous spirit of the Japanese army. This fact is evident in a diary found on the body of an enemy aircrew member who was shot down by the Japanese army in a recent attack on a certain location. The diary stated: "On a certain day, the terrifying Japanese aircraft formation flew in again today. Due to the daily attacks by Japanese aircraft, we are all suffering from sleep deprivation. Even now, just hearing the sound of Japanese aircraft, our spirits are disoriented." Their state of fear and panic was such. Furthermore, on a certain day, the Japanese army formed a special attack air corps. Yesterday, they sank a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Leyte Gulf and Sulu Sea areas. It is said that the Japanese special attack corps uses one aircraft to exchange for one ship, colliding with them in a kamikaze manner. This type of combat method is truly a tactic that no other country in the world possesses. When discussing the special attack corps, the aircrews all change color. Therefore, it has recently been confirmed that there is great fear of the special attack corps within the barracks."</p>

<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Provincial Administration Gradually Becoming Clear</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the past Jiangsu administration had many unsatisfactory aspects. Although the tax situation was extremely complicated, the lack of unity between the military and political affairs was a significant factor. In order to eliminate past obstacles and increase administrative efficiency, the central government implemented a policy of military and political unification, and appointed a Jiangsu native to govern Jiangsu, hoping to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, Mr. Ren Yuandao, a native of Hai, was specially transferred to take charge of the military and political power of Jiangsu Province, bringing a fresh atmosphere. Upon taking office, Mr. Ren announced the three key points of his future administration: respecting public opinion, eliminating corruption, and stabilizing people's livelihoods, all of which are essential and desired by the public. Mr. Ren has been in office for over two months, during which he has convened county administration, security, police, education, and construction conferences, presiding over each meeting in person. His spirit of diligence and hard work is admirable. This is also a manifestation of Mr. Ren's determination to govern with vigor and reform with determination. When the reporter stayed in Suzhou, he had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Ren, who informed him of several points: (1) At this time of the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, Jiangsu, as an important rear base, is determined to stand on the position of the nation and the people, and to cooperate and assist allied states to complete the holy war and achieve final victory. (2) The future administration of Jiangsu will follow the national policies already established by the National Government and the legacy of the late Chairman Wang, striving to thoroughly implement the central government's decrees within Jiangsu Province. (3) Emphasize spiritual construction, so that the group of political personnel will not be discouraged by the current difficult environment. We should embrace the spirit of the Father of the Nation's unyielding revolutionary spirit, so that the comprehensive peace that has not yet been realized can be achieved through our efforts. (4) I will lead by example, be selfless, and retain all existing personnel in the provincial administration, except for those who resign. I have also increased their salaries to ensure that they can serve with peace of mind and serve the people. This point can be reported to the elders of Jiangsu. In short, according to the reporter's observation, the provincial administration has gradually become clearer, which is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>Suzhou's Financial Sector</p>
<p>(1) Banking Industry: Before the war, there were a total of seventeen banks in Suzhou, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications being the giants among them. The Bank of China was established in 1913, and the Bank of Communications was established shortly after. The Jincheng Bank, a rising star, was established in 1931. At that time, the banking industry in Suzhou was extremely prosperous, worthy of being called the golden age of the industry. Taking Jincheng as an example, in the autumn of 1937, the bank's fixed deposits reached seven to eight million yuan, accounting for a large proportion of the total deposit amount. On November 12, 1937, due to military action, all banks in Suzhou ceased operations. It was not until the winter of 1939 that Zhou Wenrui, a comprador of the Bank of Taiwan, began to prepare for the establishment of the Sumin Bank, which was smaller in scale and had a limited scope of business. In 1941, due to the needs of the environment, a number of small banks were established; these small banks had weak capital, only two to three hundred thousand yuan, and their main business was lending at high interest rates. Their organizations mostly did not comply with the government's legal requirements. Now, in order to strengthen the financial sector, the government ordered all small banks on November 21 of last year to increase their capital to six million yuan. Recently, banks that have complied with the order to increase capital include Chang Kang and Yuan Yu. Banks newly established last year include Wei Ben, Wei Da, Huimin, and Minyi, which was reorganized from the Xinji Qianzhuang. The China, Bank of Communications, and Jincheng Banks, which are financially strong, resumed operations successively in 1943. Currently, there are a total of 31 banks in Suzhou. Except for the Central Reserve Bank, the Bank of Taiwan, the Jiangsu Local Bank established by the province, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and the semi-official Huaxing Bank, the rest are commercial organizations. The main operations of general banks are still similar to those before the war, mainly lending; the difference is that in the past, most loans were credit loans, but now some people use non-controlled products such as silk as collateral for loans from banks. Mortgages of real estate are still rare. As for the banks themselves, there are very few fixed deposits, and current deposits are temporary in nature and cannot be fully utilized, so there is often a shortage of funds. According to people in the industry, the total amount of silver and money in Suzhou now is only 500 million yuan, no wonder they are always short of funds.</p>
<p>(2) Money Shops: Before the war, there were twelve money shops in Suzhou. The largest in capital, such as Jinsheng and Baoda, was only 40,000 yuan. As a result of the war, all of them went bankrupt. The main reason was that the credit loans they lent to rice shops and silk shops (most of their customers were in the rice and silk industries) could not be recovered due to the business downturn in those industries, which led to the total collapse of the entire industry. Now that time has passed, they have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, with 82 having been established one after another. The main factors for this abnormal prosperity are nothing more than the following: First, the security in the four villages surrounding Suzhou is poor, and wealthy households in the countryside bring their funds to the province, causing the market to be filled with floating funds. According to rural customs, running a bank or money shop is considered an honor. Therefore, those with capital are willing to try the taste of being a bank or money shop boss. Second, although the profit margin of the silver and money industry is said to be thin, the capital required is also low. At a time when prices are soaring, not to mention huge department stores, even opening a small cigarette and paper shop with a modest scale would require more than one million yuan, while in the past, a money shop could be established with only 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. No wonder those with floating capital flock to it.</p>
<p>Currently, the silver and money industries in Suzhou each have their own associations. The money industry also has a money shop reserve fund and its own bill exchange, and it also participates in the bill exchange organized by the banking industry. Organizationally, it is more advanced than the old money shops. Unfortunately, their vision is short-sighted, and they only focus on making profits, making no contribution to the urgent need for agricultural loans.</p>
<p>General Public Life</p>
<p>Under the pressure of constantly rising prices, the difficult situation of the general public in Suzhou is comparable to that of Shanghai. In fact, the suffering may be even greater than that of Shanghai, namely the tyranny of the local uniformed class. Incidents of forced purchases are endless. The reporter witnessed a person in yellow clothes with a "Procurement" armband coming to the Changchun Sauce Garden store on Jingde Road and using 600 yuan to forcibly purchase four catties of soy sauce. At first, the shop owner pleaded for leniency, but eventually succumbed. The person in yellow clothes left triumphantly after being arrogant. The merchants dared to be angry but dared not speak out. On the day the reporter left Suzhou, the provincial authorities had issued a strict prohibition, which was celebrated by the merchants, but its effect remained to be seen.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e10">On the Current Wartime Parliament of Japan <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The 86th session of the Japanese Parliament, the so-called "Wartime Parliament," adjourned temporarily last December 27th and resumed again on the 21st of this month. At this time of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, this session of Parliament is receiving more attention from all parties. The particularly important tasks are, first, to adapt to the new situation of the decisive battle and complete the domestic decisive battle system; and second, Japan's diplomacy under the new war situation, especially further cooperation between China and Japan. I would like to express some of my views on these two points, in the hope of attracting the attention and efforts of informed people in both countries.</p>
<p>Regarding the completion of the domestic decisive battle system in Japan, there has been new progress recently. The following three points are particularly noteworthy and are expected to be deliberated by this session of Parliament:</p>
<p>First, the Japanese government announced five emergency decisive battle measures to be implemented swiftly at the Cabinet meeting on the 12th of this month, and re-examined the new national organization plan centered on the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (IRAA). In order to establish a strong political posture to strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, the "Special Committee for Establishing the National Posture for Certain Victory" of the IRAA passed a landmark motion to "establish a new national party" at the general meeting on the morning of the 17th. This is intended to more effectively mobilize the power of the people to cooperate with the government to complete the war. This point is expected to be enacted by this session of Parliament.</p>
<p>Second, the focus of the deliberations in this session of Parliament is on various urgent bills to adapt to the current decisive stage, especially the 27 bills submitted by the government to both houses, such as the amendments to the Pension Law, the Military Service Law, the Army Military Court Law, and the Navy Military Court Law, the Subsidy Law for Salaries of Active Youth School Staff, and the Wartime Financial Adjustment Law. The proposed 1.9 billion yen tax increase, the 22.2 billion yen general social budget, the special emergency supplementary budget, and temporary military expenses will all be used to demonstrate the "special attack spirit" of 110 million people in this session of Parliament.</p>
<p>Third, Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech in Parliament on the 21st, providing detailed explanations on (1) strengthening the air defense system, (2) thoroughly increasing military production, (3) striving to increase food production and strengthen the self-sufficiency system, (4) strengthening the labor system and national labor mobilization, and (5) thoroughly transforming all materials into combat power. In addition, his statements on evacuating the population from large cities, promoting the construction of new ships, having military officers and civilians jointly shoulder the responsibility of defending the country, and strengthening the unity of the countries of Greater East Asia, are all sufficient to illustrate Japan's political方針to gather all its strength, strengthen its conviction, and complete the war. The future achievements of the Parliament will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Japan's relations with the countries of Greater East Asia, especially with China, have also become a point of attention from all parties in this session of the Japanese Parliament. Prime Minister Koiso emphasized the strengthening of the unity of the countries of Greater East Asia, and in his policy speech, he stated the continental policy direction of "supporting production on the mainland" and "striving to enhance transportation capacity between Japan, Manchuria, and China." Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speech also clearly indicated the determination to thoroughly implement Sino-Japanese cooperation in both political and economic terms, and to assist in the construction of a new China. This sincere expression is, of course, given even greater importance in our country's government and public sectors.</p>
<p>Since our country joined the war, although friendly relations between the two countries have been progressing, there are still inevitably things worth contemplating and carefully considering regarding the ideals and actual manifestations of both parties. We cannot help but have ardent expectations for the attention and discussion on China's problems in this session of the Japanese Parliament.</p>
<p>When Foreign Minister Shigemitsu answered the question from Mr. Kanemitsu Tsuneo on the 21st, he strongly stated that he is currently considering new economic policies to improve China's poverty problem. Although we have not seen Foreign Minister Shigemitsu explain the specific content of this new policy, the Tokyo telephone call reported by the Mainland News yesterday (23rd) indicated: (1) Rational operation of resource combat capabilities, (2) Countermeasures against inflation, and (3) Ensuring transportation capacity. It can be clearly seen here that the allied states ardently hope that we will fulfill our task of cooperating to complete the war and further build a new and prosperous China.</p>
<p>Standing from the position of the Chinese people, in terms of what we have felt most deeply since joining the war, nothing surpasses the issues of resources, currency, and transportation. But we also deeply know that the crux of all these problems lies in the stagnation and decline of agricultural and industrial production and the lack of political power to overcome all kinds of difficulties. Looking at China today, it is truly a "crisis-ridden situation." Therefore, what we must say to the allied states and the Chinese authorities today is that the only key to the success of the so-called "China's resource combat capabilities" and the so-called "new economic policy towards China" lies in saving China from its current state of poverty and decline. It must start with assisting in increasing production, and then we can talk about truly gathering combat power and cooperating to complete the war. However, in order to increase production and achieve realization, we must frankly review the pathological conditions of the past that have reduced production. We believe that it is more appropriate for Chinese people to handle the direct and indirect work of increasing production themselves, with Japanese people in an assisting role. While encouraging ourselves, we also express our sincere expectations for this session of Parliament of the allied states.</p>

<p>After the speech, the magistrates of Kunshan County, Yang Yuqing, and others successively reported on the difficulties and key points in promoting work in their respective counties, including: (1) significant embezzlement of various taxes and levies, requiring the publication of tax revenues; (2) excessive miscellaneous taxes and levies at the local level, which the villagers cannot bear; (3) farmers unable to make ends meet, leading the village reorganization economy into a difficult state; (4) transportation difficulties, hindering the flow of goods, etc., requesting the central government to find solutions. Chairman Zou provided instructions and promised to find solutions for each issue. After the discussion session, a closing ceremony was held. Chairman Zou gave a speech, urging the county magistrates to engage in rural work with a spirit of perseverance and dedication. His words were earnest and moved the listeners.

Intense fighting has begun southwest of Łódź and between Kalisz and Toruń. The pressure from the southwest of East Prussia towards the north by the Soviet army has increased. The Soviet attack in eastern East Prussia has expanded south of the Rominten Heath. The Soviet attacks between Friedland and Insterburg have all failed. In the above operations, the German 61st Infantry Division alone has destroyed 25 Soviet tanks. The Soviet army has broken through the German defense line between Insterburg and Kurisches Haff, and fierce fighting is underway.</p>
<p>Four Major Targets of the Soviet Offensive</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: A German military spokesman pointed out that the Soviet winter offensive has four main strike targets: First, to attack Breslau and penetrate into Silesia. Second, to attack Posen and Brandenburg. Third, to advance towards Elbing. Fourth, to advance towards Königsberg. According to reports, defensive works have been constructed in the eastern and northeastern suburbs of the industrial area and west of Kempen, forming a line.</p>
<p>Successful German Defensive Battle</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Responsible German military sources stated last night that the German army is implementing countermeasures on the Upper Silesian border, marking the first time since the Soviet army launched its offensive. Regarding the success of the German defense in Upper Silesia, as stated in yesterday's German war report, the sources said that the German command's goal is to achieve the greatest military effect with the least amount of territory abandoned. It is very important that the Soviet army has been prevented from reaching its most important offensive target. The task of the German army is to protect the Upper Silesian industrial area with strong defenses, while at the same time crushing the Soviet plan to isolate East Prussia by advancing from the south to Danzig. The implementation of this task requires the sacrifice of some land. Although this phase has not yet ended, the battles in Upper Silesia and the southern border of East Prussia show that the Soviet advance has been partially repelled, and the success of the German defensive battle is considered the beginning of the solidification of the German defense line.</p>
<p>German Counterattack in Hungary Achieves Victory</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: German armored units and infantry stormed into Stuhlweissenburg with whirlwind speed and are now pursuing enemy forces a few kilometers north of the city. This is the second major victory for the German army since the Soviet army broke into the Danube River south of Lake Platten in Hungary. The Soviet Union attempted to attack Vienna with 30 infantry divisions, 3 artillery divisions, 7 tank brigades, and 1 anti-aircraft artillery division, but failed. The German army launched an offensive on January 19, and the Soviet plan was shattered. Every village between the northern end of Lake Platten and Stuhlweissenburg has been fortified by the Soviet army, so the German army encountered strong resistance during the attack. When the German army captured the first line of defense, the ratio of German to enemy deaths was about 101 to 20 to 50. The scene of the Soviet retreat was no less tragic than the 1940 campaign in France. The number of shells piled up next to the German flat-trajectory guns and anti-aircraft guns shows the intensity of the resistance.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German news agency reports: The German army, in its offensive in the Vosges Mountains, broke into Hagenau on Monday.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The war on the Western Front has now entered an interim phase. The large-scale American offensive at Ardennes has been relaxed since Friday, so there are only local battles there now. It is believed that there is an understanding between the British and Americans, to launch offensives on the eastern and western fronts simultaneously. However, while the Soviet army is fiercely attacking the Eastern Front, Eisenhower's offensive suddenly stopped. This is due to the success of Rundstedt's offensive in overturning the plans of the British and American armies. Eisenhower is currently preparing everything in military and political terms to launch a new offensive on the Western Front. To that end, he is currently reorganizing his First and Third Armies. A few days ago, General Patton's troops were seen withdrawing from Ardennes and being transferred to the Saar and south of Bitche, to carry out local offensives. Although the British Second Army's offensive in the Roermond triangle involves only five divisions, it appears to be a preparatory measure for Eisenhower's new offensive.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the only noteworthy aspect of the armistice agreement signed between Moscow and the illegal Hungarian government is that it is solely represented by the Soviet Union. According to the spokesman, after Horthy's illegal Hungarian government betrayed Germany, it originally hoped to conclude a treaty with Western countries. Therefore, it sent Eckhardt to the United States, Revesz to Sweden, and other personnel to Lisbon and Cairo. Now, as with Bulgaria and Romania, its hopes have been dashed. And in terms of the armistice agreement, the Soviet Union can do whatever it wants in Southeast Europe without external interference.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to maritime news sources: The total number of ships owned by the United States and Britain is 41 million tons, of which Britain has 10 million tons and the United States has 31 million tons. Before the outbreak of this war, the ratio of maritime power between the United States and Britain was two to one. However, British maritime power is now far inferior to that of the United States. Taking advantage of the decline of British maritime power, the United States wants to occupy the top position in the world's maritime transport, a goal that is already evident in the current war. And the shipbuilding capabilities of the United States and Britain differ greatly. Given that the United States is more actively building ships, it can be seen that the future gap between the maritime powers of the United States and Britain will be even greater.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports, Reuters dispatch: President Roosevelt's appointment of Wallace as Secretary of Commerce is likely to cause internal strife between the left and right wings of the Democratic Party. Wallace is the leader of the Democratic Party's liberal New Deal faction, while former Secretary of Commerce Jones is the backbone of the Democratic Party's conservative faction. The change of the Secretary of Commerce appears to be a victory for the New Deal faction, but Jones remains the President of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a government lending agency, and his influence in the business community is above any public or private lending agency in the country. Wallace's appointment as Secretary of Commerce must be approved by Congress. After taking office, he must also prevent the alliance between Republicans who support Jones and Democratic financiers from the southern states. The power of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation led by Jones is indeed above the Department of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Reading Mayor Zhou's Proclamation to the Citizens <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Xianqi</p>
<p>January 15th was the auspicious occasion of the inauguration of Shanghai's Mayor Zhou and his senior cadres. Although I was not invited to attend the grand ceremony, I still went to the municipal government building at eleven o'clock that morning to express my heartfelt congratulations. However, I was ultimately blocked by the guards and unable to meet the newly appointed officials, and returned home with a copy of the "Proclamation to the Citizens."</p>
<p>The first paragraph of the "Proclamation to the Citizens" briefly explains the complexity, seriousness, and depravity of the current situation in Shanghai, as well as the process by which Mr. Zhou came to serve as mayor. Mr. Zhou tells us that after Acting Chairman Chen intended to entrust the affairs of Shanghai to him, many friends advised him to consider the difficulties of Shanghai's environment in the future and not to take on the burden and sacrifice himself in vain. However, he firmly believed that in this extraordinary period, one should not consider personal matters, and finally, under the orders of Acting Chairman Chen and the urging of his comrades, he resolutely took on the heavy responsibility! I remember Mr. Wang once said that "the peace movement is a work of entering hell and jumping into a fire pit." With the current situation so serious and the environment so difficult, Mr. Zhou's concurrent appointment as Mayor of Shanghai is naturally with the determination of "If I don't go to hell, who will? If I don't jump into the fire pit, who will?"</p>
<p>Indeed, "in such a situation and such an environment, even a heavenly deity with three heads and six arms would not be able to break the stalemate and improve the status quo." Shanghai is like a patient with "disease entered into the marrow," the accumulated germs of years have penetrated deep into the heart, and with the addition of external colds, the disease is even more serious. However, this patient is not dead yet, and this patient must not die, so we must find a way to save it in a situation where there is no way. If Western medicine doesn't work, we will switch to Chinese medicine; if acupuncture and medicine are ineffective, we will take decoctions again. Plasters for bruises and injuries are applied, and tonifying pills to replenish the center and benefit qi are swallowed. With such a fair and meticulous famous doctor as Mayor Zhou, plus Mr. Luo Junqiang, a "iron-fisted assistant" with魄力 and vitality who does what he says, to operate when needed and give injections when needed, I think Shanghai can be saved, and Shanghai has a solution!</p>
<p>The root cause of China's political inability to get on the right track can be summarized in one sentence: "selfishness and self-interest." Because there is "selfishness," there will be "chaos," and because of "chaos," the people will "suffer." Now Mayor Zhou has assured everyone that he and his cadres are all young and promising, with ideals and a sense of career. They are determined to "do a good job," their spirit is "public interest outweighs private interest, society comes before the individual," and they further emphatically stated: "Absolutely will not use their power and position to seek personal gain." They "are determined to lead by example, not to be corrupt, not to pervert the law, not to engage in malfeasance, and not to extort by trickery." This way of working is deeply aware of the past malpractices of Chinese politics, and this declaration is also aimed at the source of the disease in Chinese society. In the past, and even now, many of those in power have indeed failed to lead by example, "only allowing state officials to set fires, but not allowing the common people to light lamps," "only caring about personal enjoyment, and not caring about the life and death of the common people." It is even commonplace and too numerous to mention to use their positions to engage in corruption and abuse of power, and to oppress the common people. Mayor Zhou is insightful and has endured hardships. Since he can make such responsible guarantees to the citizens when he takes office, I think he will definitely be able to establish a style of integrity in a corrupt and degenerate society where life is oppressive and human desires run rampant.</p>
<p>The day after Mayor Zhou took office, I took a tram from the South Bund to Fook Hing Road and heard a lot of chatter from the "common people." It seems that everyone is paying attention to the inauguration of the new officials of the municipal government these days. The price of rice has fallen, and commodity prices have stopped rising, which shows that even in a bad social environment, people are still afraid of the sanctions of justice. A northerner on the tram said, "Mayor Zhou will definitely not be ambiguous about corrupt officials in the future. On the day before his inauguration, he specially pulled out a director of the Supervision Bureau under his jurisdiction and executed him by firing squad, which is to show his power to future corrupt people!" Another passenger said, "Isn't that right? Secretary-General Luo's way of doing things in Anhui is also very powerful! It is said that one of his captains beat a post office clerk, so he immediately took the captain to be shot. In the future, this group of people wearing uniforms in Shanghai must also be careful!"</p>
<p>Also, on another occasion, it seemed that someone was discussing Mr. Luo's speech: A lady said, "It is said that the treatment of the police will be increased several times in the future, but after being able to maintain their lives, they will not be allowed to extort the common people. The old and bad police will be eliminated, and all will be young and strong. Public officials in general must also be able to make a living, and whoever is corrupt will be in danger of being beheaded!"</p>
<p>——This is the voice of the real citizens!</p>
<p>——This is the expectation of the real citizens!</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e27">Sketches on the Road between Beijing and Shanghai <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Danming</p>
<p>The train ticket prices have risen. At a time when the government authorities are trying to flatten commodity prices, the price of train tickets has actually risen by 140%. Even state-owned public utilities cannot help but be affected by commodity prices, and we can also see the degree of hardship in people's livelihoods in China today. It is said that when the authorities of the Ministry of Construction of the National Government approved China Railway's request for a price increase, they made it a condition that China Railway try to improve the current state of business. Therefore, although the reporter can remain silent about the previous hardships of the journey, after China Railway's price increase is implemented, when embarking on this journey that is like a devil's path again, I would like to report the truth to the readers.</p>
<p>Black Market Tickets Have Not Been Eliminated</p>
<p>Night trains have always been called "single-carrying trains." If I want to investigate the truth about the inside story of the station, this is a good attempt. Taking the train, the first hurdle is buying tickets. Every time the reporter passed the Eight Immortals Bridge on the tram in the evening and saw people carrying quilts in front of the travel agency, preparing to wait overnight to buy tickets early in the morning, I couldn't help but feel mixed emotions! "Could it be that there is still a black market to buy tickets?" I thought to myself. I went into the travel agency to buy a ticket. I was fortunate to have a few familiar staff members, so I didn't buy a black market ticket, but because of the exchange of tickets, it turned out that I lost 500 yuan. After buying the ticket, in order to see a friend, I walked into his office and heard a servant on the phone:</p>
<p>"The ticket has not been bought, because a place specializing in selling black market tickets in the Hardoon Building has been sealed."</p>
<p>"Well then, think of a way."</p>
<p>With that, the servant hurried out the door. Soon he returned and continued to speak on the telephone receiver:</p>
<p>"There is a way, but it will sell for three thousand yuan!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, I couldn't help but ask him: "Where does it cost three thousand yuan to go?" He said, "A third-class ticket to Wuxi." "Where can I buy black market tickets?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It is very difficult to buy black market tickets now," he replied to me. "Only people from China Railway are secretly peddling them through acquaintances. If you don't know this person, you have no way to buy them."</p>
<p>The China Railway authorities have recently been rectifying their operations, and evidence has been obtained here. However, it is clear that the efforts of the station alone are not enough to fundamentally eliminate black market tickets. Because after the reporter entered the station and asked his companions, although there were not many people buying black market tickets, it was not absolutely none. Now the black market price of a second-class ticket to Nanjing is close to seven or eight thousand yuan. May I ask, if the black market ticket price is not eliminated, will the significance of China Railway's price increase this time only help fuel the rise of the black market? In particular, it is said that because of this price increase, the price of rice in Shanghai has risen again these days!</p>
<p>The Scenery Before Punching Tickets</p>
<p>The second hurdle for taking the train is punching tickets. Usually, tickets are punched half an hour before the train departs, but because I am taking the night train, if you don't squeeze in the front, you won't be able to find a seat. It is okay not to sleep for one night, but it is impossible to stand upright all night. Therefore, most passengers go to the station as early as possible. Probably the night train from Shanghai to Nanjing is scheduled to depart at 10:05, but passengers have already arrived at the station to line up around 7:00. The reporter has taken the night train several times, so I have a lot of experience. On the evening of the 19th, I left home at 7:00 and took a rickshaw to the station. When I arrived at the station, it was not yet 8:00, but the first and second class ticket punching area was already crowded with people. So I lined up at the first and second class civil servant ticket punching area. Because I was bored, I talked with the people in line about their experiences of going out. According to several people who often travel back and forth between Shanghai and Bengbu, "The Zhabei Station used to be the most chaotic, but since former Governor Luo took charge, with the spirit of using heavy penalties in troubled times, it is now very different from the past." Therefore, they hope that Mr. Luo can have the same achievements after coming to Shanghai to serve as the secretary-general of the municipal government. The Shanghai Station now has a police station. Perhaps there will soon be extraordinary measures taken against all those who engage in malfeasance!</p>
<p>The situation of selling black market tickets at the station could not be seen with my own eyes because the ticket office was outside the station, but the scene of the black hats asking "single carriers" to buy passage was captured in my eyes. When the reporter was standing in line, there was a burst of noise, but I saw five people who looked like villagers and were carrying goods being driven out of the platform by Allied military police with whips. It turned out that they had first paid 500 yuan each to the black hats, so they entered the station first, but unexpectedly encountered the military police and were driven back. It was not easy to wait for the military police to leave before they limped back into the platform from the black hats. They were taking the slow train to Changzhou.</p>
<p>The people in the Beijing-Shanghai area all know the "black hat" name, and no one's heart does not beat when it is mentioned. Therefore, the reporter specially took a careful look at them today. It turned out that they were the staff of China Railway, some with armbands with the words "Guidance" written on them. They didn't look abhorrent, but when it came to punching tickets, their power was indeed amazing. They could arbitrarily ask the third-class passengers in line for money, and they could also open the iron bars of the ticket punching area to satisfy the "Yellow Fish Head," inviting the benefactors to walk into the platform, and then open the iron bars of the ticket punching area in the queuing area, ordering the passengers in line to step back, allowing the batch of benefactors to squeeze in the front. Therefore, the order became chaotic, and the later passengers kept crowding forward, which aroused the Allied station staff, who had to stand on the wall and command the black hats to maintain order with whips. At this time, the black hats were truly awe-inspiring, like executioners, raising their whips and dropping them, causing women to cry and children to scream, which was really unbearable to see.</p>
<p>"How cruel, how can they be so heartless?" Someone was discussing there.</p>
<p>Chatting in the Car with Single Carriers</p>
<p>When the bell rang and the ticket punchers punched the tickets, it could be said to be the most tense scene. The crowded situation at that time was even more difficult to describe. Especially because we stood until 9:30, suddenly a slow train entered the station, and the civil servant ticket punching area had to give way so that civil servants and Allied soldiers could exit the station. Therefore, the original queue was crowded beyond recognition. After the slow train passengers left, they lined up again, and the chaos of the order could be imagined. What's more, there were particularly many passengers today, and the ticket punching time was extended to 9:55, so people who didn't know when the train would depart were even more eager to be the first to punch their tickets. It was easy for the hospitable to squeeze out of the ticket punching area, so the reporter had to run quickly. However, when I ran to the first second-class carriage, I saw that the entrance was already packed with people. Fortunately, there was also a second-class military carriage, half of which was for passengers, and the reporter took a seat. Soon the people in line were completely on the carriage, but most of the women and children did not have seats, and there was simply no room for a foot in the carriage. The reporter was sitting next to a "single carrier." He was dressed in short clothes, wearing a velvet hat, and there was a hole in his cotton-padded jacket, which was obviously a single carrier. I asked him what he was carrying. He said it was sixty cartons of cigarettes. It turned out that what he was carrying was not rationed cigarettes, but Three-Six brand and other inferior goods. It is said that he earns 4,000 yuan each time he goes to Beijing, in addition to the second-class ticket. When he returns to Shanghai from Beijing, he brings pork or chicken, and when it is good, he can earn 10,000 or 20,000 yuan. He was originally a factory worker, but because the factory closed, he had to make a living by this. Unfortunately, he bought a joint ticket from Xiashi to Nanjing, but did not buy an express train ticket. Later, he was fined 2,900 yuan when he was caught checking tickets. At the same time, when the ticket inspector came, the Chinese conductor shouted for the third-class passengers to walk over, otherwise they would be fined more than 20,000 yuan! The reporter thought: Since China Railway is increasing ticket prices and also increasing fines, I wonder if they have also taken care of the comfort of passengers? The second-class carriage today is so crowded that there is no gap. Did they not have a limit on the number of tickets sold? If the number of tickets sold increases with the demand on the black market, what kind of state-owned enterprise is this?</p>
<p>Being a single carrier is not easy either. Because the reporter had nothing to do on the train, he chatted with those single carriers. It is said that they buy second-class tickets for several reasons: (1) They can avoid walking into the station from the fence, because there is a policeman at the entrance of the fence who wants to buy a passage for at least 100 yuan; (2) They can avoid being scoured by the black hats with "Guidance" armbands when queuing. If he sees that you have a lot of goods, he will open a "Yellow Fish Head," otherwise it will cost at least 200 yuan; (3) They can avoid being ripped off by the ticket puncher when punching tickets, which can save at least 100 or 200 yuan; (4) They can avoid being searched and extorted by the Chinese conductor with black hats and "police ride" "Yellow Hats" in the car. At the same time, the Allied conductors do not inspect in the third-class carriage, so those bad eggs can sell as much as they want, and sometimes there are inexplicable black hats who come up to rob things and extort money at other small stations. Therefore, this single carrier told me, "I would rather spend 1,500 yuan more!"</p>
<p>The Tension When Leaving the Station</p>
<p>There was nothing to say in the car overnight. The next morning at 9:30, we arrived at Xiaguan Station. When getting off the bus, the order became chaotic again, especially when approaching the ticket collection office. The inspection at the station has now been cancelled, but the ticket collectors have replaced the past inspectors in collecting money from single carriers. As long as you carry a lot of things and look like a single carrier, he will grab you and "fine" you. So, while collecting tickets, he talks about bargaining, making Nanjing Station lively again. Naturally, there are police officers helping to maintain order, but in short, it is all about legal tender. When the reporter left the ticket collection office, fortunately, I only had a briefcase in my hand, so I was not harassed. On the rickshaw entering the city, there were few pedestrians, and the air was relatively clear.</p>

<p>The Goods Rationing Office recently decided on the issuance of one dou of Grade B Phase 9 extra rice rations, one dou of Grade D-1 Phase 9 extra rice rations, and 6.2 sheng of Grade D-2 Phase 9 extra rice rations.

<p>Regarding the special allocation of flour to various noodle product merchants, the Municipal Flour and Bran Unified Distribution Office began to allocate and sell them at the beginning of this month, and it has been half a month. The original deadline was the 20th, but due to the continuous air raids, the bank's business hours were shortened, and transportation was inconvenient, so a small number of merchants did not have time to pay and ship the goods. The Unified Distribution Office, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, temporarily decided to extend it to the 25th of this month. As of tomorrow, the deadline will expire. All those who have not paid and shipped the goods are limited to complete these procedures within today and tomorrow to avoid being out of date.</p>

<p>The Municipal Goods Rationing Office, based on the No. 37 comprehensive ration card with Nos. 3092 and 3131 issued by the office and accepted by retailers, has recently discovered a forgery and the forgery organization has been seized by the police authorities. It is now being thoroughly investigated according to law, but it is feared that the forgery is still remaining outside and intended to be used, and the people will be deceived. In addition to sending a sample of the genuine certificate to each retail outlet and state-owned sales office for verification, it has also reported to the municipal government and sent a letter to the police bureau for secret investigation and arrest.</p>

<p>Mayor Zhou of this city found in the handover documents that there was a matter of collecting entertainment taxes for playing cards. Because the matter was close to being annoying, he immediately ordered the suspension of the collection of this mahjong tax. All issued card tax licenses should be immediately recalled and invalidated. The municipal government ordered the Finance Bureau to handle the matter and announced it to the public. It is said that the authorities have been ordered to cooperate in the implementation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai District Branch of the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance previously stated that since the fiscal year 1944 has ended, many companies and factories still have not paid the first type of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the fiscal year 1943. Since the profit-seeking income tax for the fiscal year 1944 is about to be levied, the bureau specially dispatched five major groups of collectors from the 4th of this month and led tax police to major roads to investigate whether each large and small company, factory, and line has declared and paid taxes. If it is found that they have not declared and paid taxes, they will be ordered to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations within one month (that is, before February 4). It is also learned that in order to increase tax revenue and unify taxation, the bureau will also implement the collection of temporary profit-seeking income tax on dog racing tracks. Negotiations are now underway, and the Yi Yuan authorities have been ordered to fill out and submit profit forms and declare and pay taxes on schedule.</p>

<p>Since the change of the Director of the Finance Bureau of this city, the collection of various taxes has been actively reorganized. The special consumption tax on pork in this city was previously collected on behalf of various pork retailers. However, there are inevitable omissions and unclear procedures. It has been decided that the slaughterhouse will collect the tax centrally from the 25th of this month. Afterwards, various pork retailers will no longer have to pay separately. The special tax not paid before the 25th of this month will still be collected by the original collection agency to collect from the retailers, and they shall not escape.</p>

<p>Liu Dexuan, Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, convened those responsible for Peking opera and spoken drama in this city at the conference hall of the Propaganda Office at 2:30 pm yesterday (23rd) for a discussion, with 15 people attending. Director Liu made a detailed statement on the past malpractices of the Propaganda Office's work on the spot. In the past, due to the examination of scripts and registration, it was very easy to establish connections with all parties, so that there were even illegal demands. For example, bad dramas were approved for examination due to bribery. In the future, the Propaganda Office staff would ask for subsidies from the outside world and forcibly set free viewing positions. There are too many things to mention. In the future, the above-mentioned things will be strictly prohibited from happening again. According to reports, the Propaganda Office staff have fixed living expenses, and illegal demands should be stopped urgently, and it is hoped that all walks of life will report them. It is said that the Propaganda Office will continue to convene those in charge of Yue opera, Shen opera, and miscellaneous drama in this city tomorrow (24th) for a discussion.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Traffic Company has made every effort to restore various means of transportation in this city, and all tram and trolleybus lines have been gradually restored, which is convenient for the citizens. However, drivers and ticket sellers on various tram lines sometimes behave unreasonably towards passengers. Although there are many passengers waiting for the bus at various stations, empty buses often pass by, allowing only one or two passengers to board, while other passengers are left standing. Such situations are often discovered, which is truly detrimental to the good intentions of the Municipal Traffic Company to maintain public transportation. It is hoped that the company authorities will pay attention.</p>

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education, considering the high rise in prices in recent years, felt that the amount of establishment funds for private secondary schools, as well as the flexible measures for raising funds promulgated by the Ministry of Education and Youth Affairs around the years 1933 and 1940, were no longer applicable in the current environment. Therefore, it specifically drafted opinions and submitted them to the Ministry of Education for approval. It has now been ordered to approve an increase in the original amounts, namely, the establishment fund for junior high schools to be 300,000 yuan, and for senior high schools to be 500,000 yuan. To facilitate fundraising for the schools, they may still refer to the flexible measures for school establishment funds promulgated in 1940 and be allowed to raise funds in installments. Those running secondary schools will have something to follow.</p>

<p>The Chinese Health Association, in view of the current difficult times and the hardship of general life, recognizes that the spread of tuberculosis is becoming increasingly rampant. According to recent statistical results, more than 20 percent of the population suffers from latent tuberculosis, which has a significant impact on public health. To meet the urgent needs of society, the association is promoting X-ray checkups for tuberculosis prevention, in order to popularize early diagnosis, prevent problems before they occur, and achieve the goals of saving medical expenses and providing relief to the poor and sick. The preferential vouchers for the X-ray checkups are calculated at a half-price of 500 yuan and have been distributed to leaders from all walks of life in order to jointly promote the eradication of tuberculosis and protect public health. After all, the cost of treatment for one person is ten or a hundred times the cost of prevention. The more difficult life becomes, the more prevention is needed. If we can eliminate latent patients and complete the work of tuberculosis prevention, it will truly be a public benefit. All proceeds from checkups this week will be donated to the Shen Xin Er Bao student loan fund. Association address: 996 Jing'an Temple Road, Majestic Building.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Establishing a Representative Organ of the Citizens: The Municipal Council <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Yan</p>
<p>At this critical juncture of the war, officials and the people should unite as one and cooperate closely to increase strength and overcome difficulties. We regret to see that in Shanghai, a city with a population of five million and the political, economic, and cultural center of the country, there is no organ representing the people. On the other hand, to win over the people, it is necessary to implement a government close to the people. To implement a government close to the people, it is necessary to respect public opinion. The way to respect public opinion is none other than to value public discourse and establish organs of public opinion. Mr. Zhou Fohai has now taken over as the mayor of this city and will certainly bring a new approach to municipal administration. We urgently hope that a representative organ of the people of the whole city—the Municipal Council—can be established. I remember that as early as 1931, the National Government promulgated the organizational law of the Municipal Council, but for various reasons, the cities were slow to establish it, but to this day, it is still felt to be urgently needed.</p>
<p>Undeniably, there are many gaps between officials and the people today. When the authorities issue a decree, the people, not understanding the intention of the authorities, may even misunderstand the good intentions of the authorities, or this decree may not fully conform to the general customs of the people, so that although the people do not actively oppose it, they passively fail to implement it effectively, which will certainly hinder the administration of the authorities. Not long ago, the municipal government organized a rice registration for the distribution of goods, and most citizens thought that this was a prelude to the authorities' forced purchase, so most of them avoided it, and very few went to register. This is because officials and the people cannot cooperate closely. To unite officials and the people as one, there must be an organ representing the people.</p>
<p>In the era of the Public Works Department, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association could be said to be a disguised municipal council, and when the concession was recovered, the association was abolished accordingly. Later, a Municipal Advisory Committee was established, which was also a representative organ of the citizens, but in substance it was not a municipal council, and many good suggestions made by the committee in the past have not been fully realized.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of the Municipal Council, I have three humble opinions:</p>
<p>First, regarding the number of councilors, assuming that the city has a population of five million, according to the organizational law, there should be 110 councilors. This number is appropriate. In fact, it may not be possible to directly elect the councilors by the citizens, but the authorities may select them, and it is necessary to recruit leaders from all walks of life, various experts, and those who have true talent and learning and noble character to serve.</p>
<p>Second, the Municipal Council has the power to resolve all municipal administrative facilities, but according to the current situation, special attention must be paid to (1) matters concerning the reorganization of municipal financial revenue, the raising of municipal public bonds, and other matters that increase the burden on citizens; (2) matters concerning the livelihood and relief of citizens; (3) matters concerning the promotion of municipal education and other cultural matters; (4) matters concerning municipal budget decisions; (5) matters concerning the operation of municipal public property and public business.</p>
<p>Third, the Municipal Council is not a government office, but a people's organization, and it must stand in a detached position and strive to avoid all formalism and empty talk.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that the Municipal Council will be established today.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Stimulating "Mutual Aid" and "Compassion" Wishing for Swift Assistance from Those in Society with Resources <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>In modern times, one cannot be solely concerned with self-cultivation, let alone only concerned with profit and forgetting public benefit. Society is a whole. If only one person becomes rich and extravagant, while the masses live in hardship, lacking clothing and food, forming a state of unequal wealth and uneven happiness, what kind of society is that? The masses are trapped in a dire situation, while I leisurely enjoy myself, without expressing compassion or making plans for mutual assistance; such a person is simply a cold-blooded animal, and we do not believe that he has a bright future. Therefore, we often advise the generally wealthy and noble people in the current environment: to sponsor social welfare more, to provide more relief to the poor masses, in order to fulfill the supreme compassion of mankind. Taking the scholarship movement as an example, is it not a cause promoted based on the psychology of "mutual aid" and "compassion"? Therefore, its effectiveness also depends entirely on the degree of this psychology among those with resources in society. The results of this "special fundraising" are certainly not bad, but not so good either! The start of school for all schools is only seven days away, and the fundraising goal is still far off. We are extremely apprehensive and anxious for the five thousand impoverished students! We hope that benevolent gentlemen will quickly provide assistance, generously donate, and accumulate immeasurable merit!</p>
<p>Zhi Zhong Donates Full Tuition Waivers</p>
<p>Zhi Zhong Girls' Middle School, located at the intersection of Datong Road and Dahua Road, is known for its comprehensive management. Recently, in response to the "special fundraising" for the scholarship fund in this newspaper and the scholarship fund specially set up by Anhua Bank on Shanxi Road, it has established five full tuition waiver slots each for senior high school and junior high school. Female students who live near the school and are in the same grade (starting in the fall semester) and whose families are impoverished and who wish to transfer to the school can register with us first for recommendation. Ten full tuition waiver slots for junior and senior high school students are equivalent to waiving 200,000 yuan in tuition and fees. The school's enthusiasm for helping students is truly admirable. We hope that other schools will follow suit to maximize the effectiveness of scholarship assistance. Society will be fortunate.</p>
<p>Xingzhong Boy Scouts Fundraise for Scholarships</p>
<p>A letter from the Xingzhong Elementary and Middle School Boy Scout Fundraising Team states: "Dear Sirs, We have come to sell newspapers and fundraise for scholarships to help impoverished students, benefit society, and cultivate talents for the country. The results are obvious and deeply admirable. Boy Scouts are based on serving society. Our team, inspired by this righteous cause, immediately organized a fundraising team, and with the support of enlightened parents and enthusiastic people from all walks of life, we have raised 200,450 yuan, which will be distributed to the Xin Shen Er Bao newspapers specifically for scholarship loans. These meager contributions are to show our small amount of support. We hope that influential people in society will generously sympathize and assist in promoting this cause. We are extremely grateful."</p>
<p>Three Brothers Jointly Form Filial Piety Team</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Zhiquan of Jianyuan Xingxian Company wrote: "Your newspaper is fundraising for the eighth scholarship fund, and I believe that contributing to education is very meaningful. Therefore, in addition to donating to our hometown schools every year, we also donate to the Rescue Out-of-School Volunteer Team run by Xinwen Bao every time. I have always admired your newspaper's active efforts in running the scholarship fund and should do my best to support it. I am now providing a check for 50,000 yuan, which is a joint donation from Pan Zhiquan, Pan Zhiheng, and Pan Yizhi, three brothers, and is named the Filial Piety Team. This small amount of money is to fulfill our obligations. I hope you will accept it and appreciate our intentions."</p>
<p>Wanlan Girls' High School Reduces Tuition Fees</p>
<p>Wanlan Middle School in this city was founded by enthusiastic educators and is very serious about relief efforts. This semester, in view of the difficulty for students to enter higher education, it has specifically lowered tuition fees. Junior high school tuition is only 10,000 yuan. It is also heard that the school offers preferential treatment to impoverished and outstanding students and has established many fee reduction and half-fee scholarships. Impoverished students with excellent academic performance can apply for registration. Students living nearby can also come directly to the school to submit documents and be admitted without examination. The school will start on February 2nd and classes will begin on the 5th. The school address is located inside the Shanghai Art College on Qiancaishi Road.</p>
<p>Major Manufacturers Donate Goods</p>
<p>The Salvation Army Bazaar organized by the Xinwen Bao Shen Bao Youth Association and the Women's Youth Association received donations of goods from major manufacturers yesterday. Huapeng Tobacco Company donated twenty cartons of twenty "Chicago" cigarettes, ten cartons of twenty "Red Man Brand" cigarettes, and twenty cartons of twenty "Million Gold" cigarettes. Mr. Qiu Da Jun donated a woolen shirt. Zhengde Condensed Milk Factory donated six cups of Zheng brand sugarcane milk. Deng Yikang Sugar Factory donated five catties of white sugar. Other factories are still in contact separately, and we hope that enthusiastic manufacturers will donate goods automatically. The address of the bazaar is Room 302, YMCA, 8 Immortals Bridge, telephone number 4040.</p>
<p>Clinic Fee Revenue Used for Scholarships</p>
<p>A letter from the Foguong Sanatorium states: "Dear Sirs, Our hospital's Department of Psychiatry uses methods such as meditation, diet, guidance, and hypnosis to treat insomnia, neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, and various neurological symptoms. In order to respond to your newspaper's scholarship movement, we have decided that from the 22nd to the 28th of this month, all income from psychiatric outpatient clinic fees will be used to subsidize scholarships. Outpatient hours are from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The address is 123 Lantian Road (Masnan Road). Please publish these two notices in the newspaper so that patients can recover their health early and subsidize student loans. We are extremely grateful."</p>

<p>(1) The association previously borrowed 50 million yuan from the Central Reserve Bank to release low-priced grain. Later, to save administrative expenses, the funds were transferred to the Municipal Government Winter Relief Committee for joint management. The funds were originally scheduled to be repaid in three installments, with the first installment due on February 10th, requiring repayment of one-third, or 15 million yuan. How should the funds be raised for repayment? It was resolved that the association would entrust Shen Xin Er Bao to publicly raise funds.</p>
<p>(2) How should the city's population be evacuated? It was resolved that the association would contact various hometown associations, land transportation agencies, and request relevant authorities to assist in organizing evacuation agencies to facilitate progress.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Work Report of the Municipal Winter Relief Committee <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Winter Relief Committee has budgeted 260 million yuan for this year's winter relief expenses. The sources are (A) 200 million yuan allocated from the National Government's temporary relief treasury bonds (not yet received), (B) 10 million yuan allocated by the National Commercial Control General Association from the cotton cloth distribution profits of the previous year, with more than 4 million yuan still available, which will soon be allocated to the committee for use. (D) 50 million yuan donated by the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association. The funds were originally intended for poverty relief work such as operating low-priced grocery stores. The funds were raised from all walks of life and have now been allocated to the committee. The committee is currently organizing three temporary relief efforts: (1) Operating nine soup kitchens, which can provide porridge for a total of 9,000 people per day. Porridge distribution began on December 25th of last year and has been ongoing for one month, and will continue for another month. (2) Operating three shelters, which are currently being actively prepared and will soon begin accepting people. (3) According to the committee's clothing distribution plan, the committee requested the municipal government to consult the Executive Yuan to instruct the Commercial Control Association to allocate 2,720 bolts of cotton cloth and 250 piculs of cotton. This has been approved, and the cotton cloth has been received. The cost is estimated at more than 22 million yuan at the military and police allocation price. However, cotton could not be allocated for the cotton item for the time being, so we had to purchase seed cotton, which costs 20,000 yuan per picul, totaling 7.5 million yuan. It has now been handed over to contractors for urgent production. As soon as it is produced, it will be distributed immediately. It is expected that it can be fully distributed before the Lunar New Year. The above three items are temporary relief efforts, costing about 40 million yuan. The remaining 200 million yuan will be used to carry out active relief work, such as student loans for impoverished students, small loans, and relief for hidden poverty. However, it has not yet been approved by the committee and will be discussed at a meeting after all funds have been collected.</p>
<p>(Another News) The Shanghai Special Municipality Winter Relief Committee's Clothing Distribution Plan is tentatively as follows: The quantity includes 5,000 sets of large-size cotton clothing, 2,000 sets of medium-size cotton clothing, 3,600 sets of small-size cotton clothing, and 3,000 pieces of women's cotton robes, totaling 13,600 sets/pieces. The distribution area is limited to within the jurisdiction of this city. The locations will be determined separately on a temporary basis. The distribution agencies will be jointly organized by the committee and the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau or entrusted to other charitable organizations. Distribution standards: (A) The elderly, weak, disabled, and those without hobbies, (B) Orphans, widows, and widowed husbands without the ability to support themselves, (C) Impoverished low-wage earners with many children, (D) Those in shelters who have no cotton clothing to keep warm.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Hongren Hospital's Year in Review <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yimin</p>
<p>In the past year, Hongren Hospital was constantly plagued by shortages, either running out of rice at the beginning of the month or coal by the fifteenth. One day it was the electricity being cut off, and the next it was the gas being shut down. Other matters, like the endless paperwork, filling out forms, and submitting reports, were secondary. The result was utter exhaustion, leaving them with no choice but to let things take their course. Despite these difficult circumstances, they somehow managed to struggle through the year with every ounce of strength they had. In that year, they saved 3,369 young lives, treated 9,039 hospitalized patients (both surgical and non-surgical), provided outpatient care to 47,503 individuals, and attended to 871 people injured on the streets and sent by the police. They also provided examinations for over 1,000 students with scholarships from the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao newspapers. Indirectly and directly, they assisted over 40 doctors from St. John's University and 18 nurses. This is the hospital's small contribution to society.</p>
<p>They managed to survive the difficulties of 1944, but who knows if they can escape the misfortunes of 1945? Today, the hospital can be said to have reached a dead end, truly in a state where it cannot close nor remain open. Having once relieved the illnesses and suffering of others, it is now itself plagued by a multitude of ailments, beyond remedy. The reason for this is undoubtedly the influence of both money and supplies. The seven necessities for a hospital are firewood, rice, oil, salt, medicine, water, and electricity. For the first four, one must have considerable power to be able to purchase them at will on the black market. But the hospital is not a producer; it is a consumer. It daily takes its limited income to compete with the endless rise of prices, ultimately resulting only in a feeling of helplessness. As for gas, water, and electricity, these are another problem altogether. In recent years, there has been a shortage of coal, leading to insufficient gas, water, and electricity supplies. The hospital's allocation has been decreasing daily. Today, many important functions have long been suspended, and when they are occasionally carried out, heavy fines are imposed. In addition, the number of patients has been increasing daily, making it impossible to cope. These two pressures are tightening day by day, leaving the hospital unable to breathe. If, unfortunately, an incident occurs and the injured come swarming in, one can only find the hospital as empty as a fishmonger's stall with dried-up fish. Therefore, for the sake of the hospital itself, it would be best to close its doors and live off its reserves, so it can survive for a little while longer. The hospital is established for society and should sacrifice itself for society. Originally, society cannot exist without hospitals, and hospitals cannot survive without society, but this close relationship has become detached in recent years. The hospital continues to serve society, but society has forgotten about the hospital due to other important issues. Currently, many hospitals in Shanghai are faltering, facing immense difficulties. It can only be hoped that the government will consider the safety of the patients, the future need for hospitals, and establish concrete and effective preferential measures for the prioritized allocation of water and electricity.</p>

<p>Date: February 6th, 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Location: Lyceum Theatre</p>
<p>A philanthropist, seeing the increasing number of refugees and orphaned children in the city in need of relief, initiated a piano concert. They specially engaged the piano prodigy Weilaqiaosi Qiaozhi to perform. The proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to various charitable organizations, using the funds from the child's artistic talents to help children in distress. This glorious act is worthy of praise. The program performed by the child prodigy Qiaozhi consists of world-renowned pieces, as well as compositions of his own. The child's two sisters will also accompany him on stage. One, Weilaqiaosi Shafei, is ten years old this year, and the other, Weilaqiaosi Meiling, is eight and a half years old. Both are known as piano masters. This program will feature a trio performance by the children, making it an unprecedented event in Shanghai. On that day, 95 tickets will be offered as donations to this newspaper's scholarship fund and other charitable causes. They are priced at 5,000, 2,000, and 1,000 yuan respectively, and will be sold by this newspaper's Social Service Department starting today. We hope music lovers and philanthropists will enthusiastically purchase tickets and participate in this great event.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Launches Fundraising Campaign <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, located at 25 Xizang Road, has 72 free beds year-round, providing free medical care, meals, and year-round free medical consultations and medicine to the poor and sick. During the summer epidemic season, outpatient services are completely free. In the past year, the hospital's medical work included 53,815 outpatient visits, of which 41,016 were free, and 22,430 inpatient admissions, of which 12,104 were free. The hospital's income was over 15,370,000 yuan, of which over 7,170,000 yuan was from donations. Expenditures were over 15,660,000 yuan, resulting in a deficit of over 293,000 yuan. Currently, the hospital's funds are depleted, and its relief work for the poor and sick cannot be maintained and is on the verge of collapse. At this critical juncture, it has no choice but to appeal to the public for assistance. It is expected that this year's expenses will increase three or four times compared to last year. Therefore, it is launching a fundraising campaign with a target of 20,000,000 yuan (which will only cover expenses for six months). It is deeply hoped that people from all walks of life will be charitable and generously donate so that this target can be reached. It would be most fortunate if, at the end of this old lunar year, people would divert their customary social spending to help the hospital, and if businesses and manufacturers would allocate a portion of their profits to donate funds, thereby benefiting the poor and sick, and contributing to society. Surely the merit would be immeasurable!</p>

<p>The elementary school teachers' winter vacation in-service training program, organized by this newspaper, held its opening ceremony at Shanghai Women's Middle School the day before yesterday (the 21st) at 2:00 PM. A total of over two hundred elementary school teachers attended, creating a grand occasion. The chairman first gave an opening speech, stating: "Education in Shanghai has declined in quality in recent years. The main reason is that teachers live a poor life, work too hard, and have no energy for further study. However, education is a century-long plan for the nation and cannot be neglected. This newspaper has repeatedly held vacation in-service training programs to supplement their shortcomings, improve the level of teachers, and increase teaching efficiency. Everyone should work harder, devote themselves to children's education, and live up to their sacred mission." Then, Dr. Tan Tiankai gave a lecture on "The Yan-Li School of Thought," and Mr. Wei Wuchou spoke on "The Self-Cultivation of Elementary School Teachers," with many insightful and moving words. Finally, educator Mr. Shi Renfu spoke on "Elementary School Moral Education," and Mr. Shen Baiying spoke on "Kindergarten and Arithmetic Teaching," with concise arguments and detailed explanations. The atmosphere at the meeting was harmonious. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>

<p>A letter from the Class A students of the Huimin Advanced Midwifery Vocational School states: "We are writing to inform you that as the end of the semester approaches and graduation is imminent for the students in this class, we originally planned to hold a tea party to commemorate the occasion. However, the teachers believed that in these extraordinary times, it is unnecessary to spend so much and instructed us not to hold one. In addition to our gratitude, the students each donated 1,000 yuan, totaling 12,000 yuan, and sent it to your office. Please allocate it to the Huimin maternity subsidy fund, to provide some assistance in providing free delivery services to poor pregnant women. This would not only put the students at ease, but the teachers would also approve. We are very grateful for your trouble."</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage began its fundraising campaign, two weeks have passed. Although it has received enthusiastic support from people in all sectors of society, it is still far from reaching its target.

Shen Yongkang, the deputy commander, specially solicited donations from friends and relatives in Hangzhou and Songjiang, raising a total of 260,000 yuan. His arduous travel is admirable. It is hoped that charitable individuals, adhering to the principle of loving children and caring for the young, will generously donate to complete the 10,000,000 yuan target so that the orphanage's educational endeavors will not be interrupted.
