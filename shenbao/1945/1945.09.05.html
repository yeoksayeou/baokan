<p>吾人卽獲勝利，則今日之上海巳非往昔之上海，五十年來在上海所累積所表現之民族恥辱，巳爲八年軍民血汗洗滌浄禮，今後上海必將以抗戰之光榮歷史，繼續爲建設國家，保障和平盡其最大努力，上海市民亦必以大國民之風度，爲全國作模範，奠基礎」。</p>
<p>先頭部隊約二千人</p>
<p>又據該司令部主任秘書胡靜如語中央社記者云：「第三方面軍前率命在黔桂一帶作戰，攻克柳州·桂林後，大部軍隊即集結柳州，故此次進駐上海之第三方面軍，均由柳州起飛，先頭部隊將於日內到達，預計到達之空運部隊約有二千餘人，因營房尙未完全準備就緒，故來滬之國軍將暫留駐於大塲機塲之飛機棚內，不即入市區。本前進指揮所先行來滬之任務，爲搜集日方駐防地區之地面表册等材料，以作初步接收準備，至湯恩伯將軍則將俟國軍大部空運抵滬後，再行自陪都飛滬」云云。又美方工程人員數十人，昨晨分乘運輸機五架飛抵上海</p>

<p>中央社訊　第三方面軍副司令官兼前進指揮所主任張雪中將軍，昨晚六時在華懋飯店召見上海地區日方軍事負實人，舉行首次接收會議。會塲設於華懋飯店八樓餐應內，上縣總理遺像及黨國旗，塲中置一長形圓桌，上設三席，居中爲張雪中中將，左爲鄭洞國中將，右爲美聯絡指揮部參謀長狄巴斯上校，橫設兩座，左爲總參議徐祖詒中將，右爲副參謀長李元凱中將，下設五座，爲日方派來之五軍官座位，至六時十分，日方代表魚貫而入，向張將軍等一鞠躬後入座，先由日方參加此項會議之負責者十三軍參謀長土居明夫中將介紹與會各代表之職務姓名計爲參謀副長川本少將，高級參謀笹井大佐，參謀市井中佐（其下首末座爲日方之翻譯），俟土居明夫介紹完畢後，張副司令官亦一一介紹與會各代表之職務及姓名。</p>
<p>正式會議經過情形</p>
<p>旋即開始正式會議，首由張主任發言稱；「本人代表第三方面軍司令湯恩伯將軍，遵照中國陸軍總司令何應欽將軍命令，規定接受京滬區日軍投降事宜，並先在上海設立前進指揮所，由本人主持，現以中字第四號代電致送貴官，希査收轉交貴官長」。土居明夫點首示允後，張主任繼詢「貴官是否係松井將軍全權代表，請將軍證明書送閱」，士居答稱：「此次並非正式是　降書之會議，故未帶證明書，但依據日方習慣，參謀長在外可代表司令官，如果在此會議上有必要，則立即可照辦」。張主任屬於會後補交證明書，一面將代電送交土居明夫，請其簽字蓋章，但土居明夫稱，因現在戰地關係，平時不用岡章，故改用签字　押，以證明巳收到此項代電。張主任繼乃再詢日方「所有中國陸軍總司令部先後向岡村將軍所提備忘錄，所令準備文件報告表冊，屬於貴軍範圍者，是否巳經備齊全」，土居明夫答稱，「巳都齊全」。張氏再告以「其中須包括上海兵力配備，海空軍設備器材，各種軍管理事業倉庫糧食公產等，請將表冊交我」，土居答稱「今天未帶來，一切文書巳準備齊全，準於明日（即今日）上午八時（東京時間九時）交到貴處」。張氏乃告日方代表「關於交接防務及各種接收方法，將用書面或口頭告知，請另候通告」，土居表可後，張氏在責令日方「所有上海市及市郊，在未經本軍接收前，一切地方治安秩序及公用事業如水電·電話·電車·公共汽車等之維持，應有日方完全負責」，土居答稱「關於公用事業，如火車·水電，用煤量極大，原來此項煤斤由華北運來，但目前日方力量不夠，對此巳無把握，存煤缺乏維持恐極困難，且鐵道工人又時生事故，現日方對各公用事業及火車盡力維持，但最嚴重者爲煤與工人問題，此事日方巳向貴方南京陸軍總司令部報告，一方並巳請蔣伯誠·吳紹　兩先生聯合發出布告，論令工人安心工作，至於維持上海治安，日方巳竭盡力量，現惟盼貴國軍隊速即來滬，俾日方得以早日交御警戒上海之責任，使上海之安寗秩序早日恢復，至此會議完畢，時爲六時三刻。</p>

<p>共信互信建國必成</p>
<p>現抗戰雖巳勝利，任務仍未完畢，目前急待共同進行的復員，最近必須完全實施的憲政，有許多大事要做。關於前者，要爲軍人布置就業的機會，要爲抗戰家屬取得必需的救濟，要爲毀於砲火的城市鄉村策復興，要爲海外僑胞謀復業，要爲靑年解決求學的困難，要爲工鑛農商各業開拓發展的出路。關於後者，要加緊完成地方自治，要切實保障人民權利，要從速成立各級民意機關，要充分養成尊重法治習慣。凡此種種，尤必賴我同胞應用抗戰時期的賓貴敎訓，一以貫之於最後一程的建國抗戰，卽由拾小異·祛私見而解決戰時問題，建國更應尊重統一，避免分裂，以開關建設的道路。抗戰卽由自助而得人助，建國更應各盡其力，以求得國際的助力。甚願我同胞記取前訓，共圖全功。同胞們！禦侮救亡的大戰巳獲勝利，富强康樂的國家，自由和平的世界，正照耀在我們的眼前，但非慘淡經營，同向前進，便無由實現。</p>

<p>前者指出國人好大喜功的習氣，人家的結晶，我們總是「古已有之」，因此不求進步，科學落後。語重心長，發人深者。</p>
<p>我國人的聰明機智，不下於任何國人，這是老實不客氣的話，所逹的，有了一知半解，就自觀甚高，夜郞自大。就　弄玄虛，自作聰明。秘之就諱之，惟恐人知，　論硏究，自無進步了。因此，一切一切的發明發現，縱然「古已有之」，充其邊不過皮毛之見而已，「依然故我」而已。</p>
<p>今後必須打破玄虛自大的習氣，以不斷硏究，精益求精的精神，迎頭趕上。</p>
<h3 id="c34">古已有之與　今已有之 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 兵丁</p>
<p>原子炸彈的出現舉世矚目，與論震　，它的威力直逹三十公里，執世界新兵器的牛耳，對於這次和平，有着莫大作用，大家都贊吧美國人　正了不起。</p>
<p>忽然我又聽說：原子炸彈原來是中國人發明的，美國科學家不過是根據中國人的學說從事硏究與製造而已。這樣說來美國固然偉大，中國人尤其了不起，言之　鹽，有名有姓，幾乎說此人已在和美國科學家對分諾具爾獎金了，後來方纔聽說的確有位中國學者，對原子繫破的某　現兼，首先發現，於是轉輾流傳，變成原子炸彈是中國發明的了，不過雖然小小發現，一定也化費一番心血，然而是不是確已分得諾貝爾獎金，畢竟還不可知。（編者按：本日本　邢質人君記周厚甫光生一文，可以參證。）</p>
<p>從來我們就喜駝居功，別人費了九牛二虎之力的事，我們卻悠然抽一口烟，鄙夷地說，我國早人飛機還沒發明的時候，公輪子已經削木　高飛了，哥倫布還沒出世，中國早知地球是圓的了，坦克車不過是諸葛亮的木牛馬，電子徵子的學說，無是非中國的太極無極罷了。誠然誠然，我國文物邦遠較蠜夷開化得早，當我們黃帝的子孫一個個衣冠楚楚在硏究周易的時候，人家還是茹毛飲血，穴居的野生動物，所以我們祖光的火藥羅盤等四大發明，在人類史上，留下了不可磨滅的功躋，可是人家在用火藥轟炸地層，開　礦產，我們却用火藥製或燧竹，　　迎神，人　用羅盤航海探險，我們却用來定方位看風水，千百年來，枉用我們的聰明做着不見摸不着的蠢事，因此人家乘着流綫型火車飛馳，我們還坐着古代的獨輪小車　　而行。然而我們還陶醉　「古已有之一四個大字，　淫於古有的四大發明，呑而吐，吐而稪在地反芻，甚至運原有的一點精華也都保不住，漫論改進。</p>
<p>其實好喜　功的國家不只我們中國，蘇聯會夸口說，還在安迪生發明電燈以前，　聯早憶使用過電燈了，日本說，十八世紀的Koklckl早在槓濱橋上試騐飛行成功了，然而人家雖　誇大，一方面倒底還在埋頭苦幹，蘇聯的幾個五年計劃都實現了，日本在八年中也把製造飛機的拔術學會了，唯獨我們中國，依然落後得遠，除了能夠發明無綫電燈，牛力引擎之外，連雙小小的彈簧都造不好，人家早有的技術，中國至今尙無，古來更無，所以我們的希　，凡別人所有的科學，技術，我國倒不必「古已有之」，縱然不能「今已有之」，至少應該「今將有之」，那末，復興建國之道。庶乎近了。</p>
<h3 id="c35">記周厚甫先生 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 邢質人</p>
<p>二個月前，見報載我國物量化學敎授周厚甫先生，榮獲本年度諾貝爾國際獎金中的化學一項，並稱美國合衆社記者會親往訪問比　居重慶近　之中國大科學家云云。我　到這則簡單的親聞時，心中眞有說不出的愉快，一向科學落後，事事仰人鼻息的中國，現在也有掦眉吐氣的日子。尤其欣愉的，據說周先生獲獎的原因，仍是由於硏究原子分裂說有極大成就，而這項的硏究，又正是二十世紀最進步的科學，極動世界的原子炸彈。</p>
<p>周原甫早年以庚子賠款留學，　國後，任杭州國立浙江大學化學系主任職，對學生循善誘，請　不倦。戰前會將一有關原子週期表之論文，刋載上海某英文晚報，並致函各國化學家，請求賜敎，各國科學專家，請求賜敎，各國科學專家對此論文，頗多討論，認為殊有硏究價値。七七抗戰旣起，浙大由杭州遷到嚴州，二度遷貴州遵義，先生一直在浙大執敎鞭，似乎豐子愷先生在「敎師日記」中也提起過。</p>
<p>周先生對農用化學也有硏究，在浙大時，當局為他特關一專門硏究室，聽說他又會任敎於貴省某專門學院，不知確否？後又譯敎育部派往英國，硏究電氣學，今年二月始返國，合衆社記者說他在英硏究時，生活異常刻苦，反國時甚至在加爾各答身無分文，經友人資助始得成行，學者中刻苦自勵如周先生者，委賓少見。</p>

<p>Key Points of the Speech</p>
<p>Japan was the first country to launch aggression, and Japan's unconditional surrender marks the final failure of aggressor nations. China was the first country to be invaded and the one that resisted aggression for the longest time. After eight years of arduous struggle and cruel sacrifice, we persevered and fulfilled our duty as a member of the United Nations. Although Japan's fate of failure was predetermined, the Japanese were a stubborn enemy, and the war could have been prolonged. This early victory, shortening the war and reducing human sacrifice, is thanks to the united efforts of the Allied nations, the collaborative efforts of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in resolving the European war, which enabled a swift transfer of forces to the Pacific. We are especially grateful to the Soviet Union for resolutely joining the war, accelerating the collapse of the Japanese invaders. In particular, we are grateful and will never forget the righteous actions of the United States, which fulfilled its great mission as the arsenal of the United Nations, contributing in military, economic, and scientific terms to achieve Japan's unconditional surrender today. China's seaports have been blockaded for many years, and the military and civilians have been struggling under extremely difficult conditions. We are especially grateful to the Allied envoys, Allied generals, particularly General Wedemeyer, Commander of US Forces in China, who shared life and death with us in the China theater, united and unwavering. This is something that the Supreme Commander of the China Theater and all officers and soldiers particularly appreciate and are grateful for. Today, we celebrate our joint victory with the utmost joy, but the main task remains how we, the United Nations, will continue to work to lay the foundation for lasting world peace after achieving today's victory. China will certainly strive for lasting world peace with the spirit of resistance. Long live the joint victory of the United Nations.</p>

<p>According to a Central News Agency report, Shanghai citizens, longing for the National Army for eight years, will be airlifted to Shanghai within days. The National Army ordered to be stationed in the Nanjing-Shanghai area this time is the Third Front Army of the Army Headquarters, led by Tang Enbo. Deputy Commander Zhang Xuezhong, Zheng Dongguo, and Chief of Staff Xu Zuyi, along with an entourage of over forty people, arrived in Shanghai by plane yesterday morning and established the Third Front Army Advance Command Post on the seventh floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, and began preliminary takeover preparations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Over Forty People Arrived in Shanghai by Plane</p>
<p>The Third Front Army Advance Command Post is presided over by Deputy Commander Zhang Xuezhong. Zhang, along with Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo, Chief of Staff Xu Zuyi (currently the Dean of the Research Institute of the Army University), Deputy Chief of Staff Li Yuankai, Chief Secretary Hu Jingru, Chief of Staff He Yiming of the Third District Garrison Command, and staff secretary Zhong Xiangzhen, a total of twenty-four people, and Major Dibas, the Chief of Staff of the US Liaison Command, and engineering personnel, a total of over forty people, flew from Liuzhou on seven C54 transport planes at 3 AM yesterday morning and landed at Dachang Airport at around 8 AM. Over a hundred people, including Commander Zhang Jie of the Second Air Force District and people from all walks of life, welcomed them at the airport. On the Japanese side, Lieutenant General Matsui, commander of the 13th Army stationed in Shanghai (i.e., the troops), sent Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Kawamoto, Senior Staff Officer Colonel Sasai, and Staff Officer Lieutenant Colonel Ichikawa. On the naval side, Colonel Kuwahara was sent. On the air force side, Major Nakamura, commander of the 43rd Aviation Brigade, arrived at the airport in advance to welcome them. When Deputy Commander Zhang and others disembarked, the Japanese officers stood at attention and saluted. They then took nine cars to rest on the seventh floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. At 10:30 AM, Mayor Wu Xun and Secretary-General Huang Boqiao of the representative office visited Director Zhang and Deputy Commander Zheng and immediately held a military meeting to discuss the steps for the military takeover of Shanghai and the general situation. The meeting concluded at 12 PM.</p>
<p>Zhang Gave a Written Statement</p>
<p>Director Zhang issued a written statement to the Central News Agency reporter saying: "Our Front Army was ordered to go to the Nanjing-Shanghai area to accept the unconditional surrender of the Japanese army. I led the advance command post to Shanghai first to make all necessary preparations. When the plane landed, we saw the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun flying over the city again, which was truly exciting.</p>
<p>Recalling the "August 13th" Battle of Shanghai, we strongly resisted the enemy's offensive in Shanghai for three months. This earth-shattering and awe-inspiring feat was due to the brave efforts of our troops. The people of Shanghai warmly assisted in the war of resistance, contributing money and efforts, shedding blood and sweat, and enduring all kinds of suffering and sacrifice, which inspired morale, shifted international perceptions, and promoted the national fighting spirit. It is the beautiful foundation for today's victory.</p>
<p>Now that we have won victory, Shanghai today is no longer the Shanghai of the past. The national humiliation accumulated and manifested in Shanghai over the past fifty years has been washed away by the blood and sweat of the military and civilians over eight years. In the future, Shanghai will continue to make its greatest efforts to build the country and protect peace with the glorious history of the war of resistance. The citizens of Shanghai will also set an example for the country and lay the foundation with the demeanor of great citizens."</p>
<p>About Two Thousand Vanguard Troops</p>
<p>According to Chief Secretary Hu Jingru of the command, the reporter from the Central News Agency said: "The Third Front Army was ordered to fight in the Guizhou-Guangxi area, and after capturing Liuzhou and Guilin, most of the troops gathered in Liuzhou. Therefore, the Third Front Army stationed in Shanghai this time will all fly from Liuzhou. The vanguard troops will arrive within days. It is estimated that there will be more than two thousand troops arriving by air. Because the barracks are not fully prepared, the National Army coming to Shanghai will temporarily stay in the aircraft sheds at Dachang Airport and will not immediately enter the urban area. The task of our advance command post to come to Shanghai first is to collect materials such as surface registers of the Japanese defense area to make preliminary preparations for the takeover. General Tang Enbo will fly from the accompanying capital to Shanghai after most of the National Army has arrived by air." Several dozen US engineering personnel flew to Shanghai on five transport planes yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Central News Agency: Lieutenant General Zhang Xuezhong, Deputy Commander of the Third War Area and Director of the Forward Command Post, summoned the Japanese military representatives responsible for the Shanghai area at the Cathay Hotel at 6:00 PM last night to hold the first takeover meeting. The meeting place was set in the dining room on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel, with a portrait of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and the national flag of the Kuomintang. A long, round table was placed in the center of the room with three seats at the head, occupied by Lieutenant General Zhang Xuezhong in the center, Lieutenant General Zheng Dongguo on the left, and Colonel Dibas, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Liaison Command, on the right. Two seats were placed laterally, with Lieutenant General Xu Zuyi, Chief of Staff, on the left and Lieutenant General Li Yuankai, Deputy Chief of Staff, on the right. Five seats were placed below for the five Japanese officers attending. At 6:10 PM, the Japanese representatives entered in single file, bowed to General Zhang and others, and took their seats. First, Lieutenant General Doi Akio, Chief of Staff of the Thirteenth Army, who was in charge of the Japanese side's participation in the meeting, introduced the duties and names of the attending representatives: Major General Kawamoto, Deputy Chief of Staff; Colonel Sasai, Senior Staff Officer; and Lieutenant Colonel Ichii, Staff Officer (the last two seats were for the Japanese translators). After Doi Akio finished his introductions, Deputy Commander Zhang also introduced the duties and names of the attending representatives one by one.</p>
<p>Formal Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>The formal meeting then began immediately. Director Zhang spoke first, stating, "I represent General Tang Enbo, Commander of the Third War Area, and am acting in accordance with the orders of General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, to accept the surrender of the Japanese army in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. A forward command post has been established in Shanghai, presided over by myself. I am now sending you a telegram with the code 'Zhong Zi No. 4'. I hope you will examine it and forward it to your superior officer." Doi Akio nodded in agreement, and Director Zhang continued to ask, "Are you the plenipotentiary representative of General Matsui? Please present your certificate of authorization for review." Doi replied, "This is not a formal surrender signing meeting, so I did not bring the certificate. However, according to Japanese custom, the Chief of Staff can represent the Commander. If it is necessary at this meeting, it can be done immediately." Director Zhang requested that the certificate be submitted after the meeting, and at the same time handed the telegram to Doi Akio and asked him to sign and stamp it. However, Doi Akio stated that due to the wartime situation, seals were not usually used, so he would use a signature to prove that he had received the telegram. Director Zhang then asked the Japanese side, "Have all the memoranda and report forms that the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army has successively submitted to General Okamura been prepared, as well as the documents that have been ordered to be prepared, and which fall within the scope of your army?" Doi Akio replied, "Everything is ready." Zhang then said, "This should include the deployment of forces in Shanghai, naval and air force equipment and materials, and various military-managed enterprises, warehouses, food, and public property. Please hand over the forms." Doi replied, "I didn't bring them today. All the documents have been prepared and will be delivered to your office at 8:00 AM tomorrow (Tokyo time 9:00 AM)." Zhang then told the Japanese representatives, "You will be informed in writing or verbally about the handover of defense and various takeover methods. Please wait for further notice." After Doi acknowledged this, Zhang ordered the Japanese side, "Before our army takes over, the Japanese side shall be fully responsible for maintaining the security and order of all areas in Shanghai and its suburbs, as well as public utilities such as water, electricity, telephone, tram, and public buses." Doi replied, "Regarding public utilities, such as trains, water, and electricity, the amount of coal used is very large. Originally, this coal was transported from North China, but at present, the Japanese forces are insufficient. There is no certainty about this and the lack of coal will make it very difficult to maintain. Moreover, accidents often occur among railway workers. The Japanese side is doing its best to maintain various public utilities and trains, but the most serious problems are coal and workers. The Japanese side has reported this matter to your Nanjing Army Headquarters and has also asked Mr. Jiang Bocheng and Mr. Wu Shaoquan to jointly issue a bulletin ordering the workers to work with peace of mind. As for maintaining the security of Shanghai, the Japanese side has done its best. Now we only hope that your national army will come to Shanghai as soon as possible, so that the Japanese side can hand over the responsibility of guarding Shanghai as soon as possible and restore the peace and order of Shanghai as soon as possible." The meeting ended at 6:45 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Kuomintang's Letter to All Compatriots (3): Hoping for Unity of Purpose to Accomplish the Great Task of National Reconstruction <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Mutual Trust and Confidence Will Ensure the Success of National Reconstruction</p>
<p>Although the War of Resistance has been won, the task is not yet complete. What urgently needs to be done together at present is demobilization, and what must be fully implemented soon is constitutional government. There are many important things to do. Regarding the former, we must arrange employment opportunities for soldiers, obtain necessary relief for families of those who fought in the war, plan for the reconstruction of cities and villages destroyed by artillery fire, seek to restore the businesses of overseas Chinese, solve the difficulties of young people in seeking education, and open up avenues for the development of industry, mining, agriculture, and commerce. Regarding the latter, we must accelerate the completion of local self-government, earnestly guarantee the rights of the people, establish people's representative bodies at all levels as soon as possible, and fully cultivate respect for the rule of law. For all these things, we must rely on our compatriots to apply the valuable lessons learned during the War of Resistance, consistently to the final stage of national reconstruction: that is, to resolve wartime problems by setting aside minor differences and eliminating personal prejudices, and to open up the road to construction by respecting unity and avoiding division in national reconstruction. Just as the War of Resistance gained assistance from others through self-help, national reconstruction should also seek international assistance by each doing their best. I sincerely hope that my compatriots will remember the previous lessons and work together to achieve complete success. Compatriots! The great war to resist aggression and save the nation has been won. A prosperous and happy country, a free and peaceful world, are shining before our eyes, but they cannot be realized without arduous efforts and joint progress.</p>
<p>Our party has always earnestly hoped to return the government to all compatriots, that is, to have all compatriots jointly shoulder the great task of national reconstruction and accomplish the great cause of national reconstruction, and to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings that "sovereignty belongs to all the people" and "construction must begin with the people" in one fell swoop. If our compatriots can avoid complacency and laziness, seize the opportunity to jointly shoulder great responsibilities, our party will certainly be able to share joys and sorrows with our compatriots and jointly build a Republic of China where ethnic groups are equal, civil rights are unimpeded, and people live in happiness and prosperity. Our party trusts that our compatriots will surely be able to ensure the success of national reconstruction from today onwards, just as it trusts that our compatriots were able to ensure the victory of the War of Resistance before today. Our compatriots can trust that the promises of our party today and in the future will surely be fulfilled, just as they have proven that the promises of our party before today have already been fulfilled. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "The foundation of national reconstruction should begin in the mind." The interweaving of this kind of mutual trust and confidence between our party and all compatriots is the main force that has won the War of Resistance today and is the guarantee for the success of national reconstruction in the future. May all fathers, elders, and brothers in the country take note. (To be continued)</p>

<p>In recent years, the roads in this city have been poorly maintained, especially with small vendors lining the sidewalks, air-raid shelters being dug, and garbage being dumped, which not only affects the appearance of the city, but also poses a great obstacle to public health.

<p>The Shanghai Temporary Military Liaison Office is the highest institution currently responsible for public security in the city. It has been extremely busy these days preparing for official business. Tasks such as correcting the actions of various troops stationed in Shanghai, maintaining public order in the city, and arresting those who disrupt public security are all underway, so that the residents can live in peace and be able to earn a living. Recently, given the large number of military institutions and troops stationed in Shanghai, it is difficult to guarantee that speculators will not take the opportunity to act. In addition to notifying various institutions and troops to register by a certain date, starting today, several special commissioners and staff members will be dispatched to the registered troops to conduct a detailed investigation of their content. Those who have unclear origins or are not needed to be stationed in Shanghai will be adjusted accordingly in order to maintain military discipline.</p>
<p>(Another report) Recently, there have often been unscrupulous people who falsely claim to be from the Zhongjiu Army and use the name of the Youth Corps to swagger around or arrest criminals, or seize supplies without authorization, violating laws and regulations, which is extremely hateful. The Military Liaison Office has informed all the military police teams and the current police bureau to conduct close investigations at any time. It is reported that the Qingnian Tuan (Youth Corp) will no longer issue badges from today onwards, except for gatherings, in order to prevent counterfeiting. When performing tasks externally, they must rely on official letters. In regard to the Zhongjiu Army, soldiers have been strictly ordered to abide by military discipline. In the future, if any of the above-mentioned misconducts occur again, citizens are allowed to report the facts to the liaison office at any time, or report to the military police team nearby for immediate execution.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Catching Up <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>Today's newspaper published two articles, one by Mr. Bing Ding entitled "Already Existed in Ancient Times vs. Now Exists," and the other by Mr. Xing Zhiren entitled "Remembering Mr. Zhou Xufu." The latter article describes Mr. Zhou's great achievements in atomic research, for which he won two international awards this year.</p>
<p>The former article points out the Chinese people's habit of being fond of boasting and seeking quick success. We always say that other people's crystallizations "already existed in ancient times," and therefore do not seek progress and fall behind in science. The words are earnest and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>The intelligence and ingenuity of the Chinese people are no less than those of any other country. This is an honest and unpretentious statement. What is lacking is that, with a smattering of knowledge, we become very conceited and think highly of ourselves. We like to play with mystery, to pretend to be clever, to keep secrets, and to be afraid of others knowing. Then there is no progress in research. Therefore, all inventions and discoveries, even if they "already existed in ancient times," are nothing more than superficial views, and "things remain as they were."</p>
<p>In the future, we must break the habit of mystery and arrogance and catch up with the spirit of continuous research and striving for excellence.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Already Existed in Ancient Times vs. Now Exists <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>The appearance of the atomic bomb has attracted worldwide attention, and public opinion is shocked. Its power reaches thirty kilometers and leads the world's new weapons. It has had a great effect on this peace. Everyone praises the Americans as truly remarkable.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard that the atomic bomb was originally invented by the Chinese, and American scientists were only conducting research and manufacturing based on the Chinese theory. In this way, the United States is indeed great, and the Chinese are even more remarkable. The words are definite, with names and surnames, almost saying that this person has already split the Nobel Prize with American scientists. Later, I heard that there was indeed a Chinese scholar who first discovered a certain phenomenon of atomic bond disruption. Thus it spread around and became that the atomic bomb was invented by the Chinese. However, even a small discovery must have cost a lot of effort, but whether he has indeed won the Nobel Prize is still unknown. (Editor's note: This can be corroborated by Mr. Xing Zhiren's article about Zhou Houfu.)</p>
<p>We have always liked to take credit. For things that others have spent a great deal of effort on, we leisurely take a puff of cigarette and say contemptuously, "When the country was already developing planes, before the invention of planes, the carpenter already made wooden wheels to fly high," "Before Columbus was born, China knew that the earth was round," "Tanks are just Zhuge Liang's wooden oxen and flowing horses," "The theory of electronic entanglement is just the Chinese Taiji and Wuji." Indeed, indeed, our country's civilization is far more advanced than that of the barbarians. When the descendants of our Yellow Emperor were all dressed in Zhou-dynasty style clothing studying the Book of Changes, they were still drinking blood and living in caves as wild animals. Therefore, the four great inventions of our ancestors, such as gunpowder and the compass, left indelible achievements in human history. However, people use gunpowder to bomb the earth and open up mines, but we use gunpowder to make firecrackers to welcome gods. People use compasses for navigation and exploration, but we use them to determine directions and look at feng shui. For thousands of years, we have wasted our intelligence on stupid things that cannot be touched or seen. Therefore, people are speeding on streamlined trains, and we are still riding ancient wheelbarrows, walking slowly. However, we are still intoxicated with the four big words "already existed in ancient times", intoxicated by the four great inventions of the ancients, swallowing and spitting, spitting and ruminating on the ground, and even the original little essence cannot be preserved, let alone improved.</p>
<p>In fact, we are not the only country that likes to take credit. The Soviet Union boasts that it used electric lights before Edison invented the electric light. Japan says that Koklckl in the eighteenth century had already succeeded in test flights on the Ryogoku Bridge. However, although people are exaggerating, they are still working hard. The Soviet Union has fulfilled several five-year plans, and Japan has also learned the skills of manufacturing airplanes in eight years. Only we Chinese are still far behind. In addition to being able to invent wireless electric lights and cattle-powered engines, we cannot even make a small spring. Other people's existing technology, China still does not have today, and there was no such thing in ancient times. Therefore, our hope is that for all the science and technology that others have, our country does not need to have "already existed in ancient times", and even if we cannot have "now exists", at least we should have "will have now". Then, the way to revitalization and nation-building is perhaps near.</p>
<h3 id="e35">A Record of Mr. Zhou Houfu <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Zhiren</p>
<p>Two months ago, I saw in the newspaper that Professor Zhou Houfu, our nation's expert in physical chemistry, had won this year's Nobel International Prize in Chemistry. It was also mentioned that a reporter from the United States' Associated Press would personally visit this great Chinese scientist, who resides near Chongqing. When I read this simple piece of news, I felt an indescribable joy in my heart. China, which has always been scientifically backward and reliant on others, now has days of pride and glory. What is especially gratifying is that Mr. Zhou's award is said to be due to his great achievements in the study of atomic fission, which is the most advanced science of the 20th century, the extremely world-shaking atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Zhou Yuanfu studied abroad in his early years with the Boxer Indemnity. After returning to China, he served as the head of the Chemistry Department at National Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, patiently guiding students and tirelessly teaching. Before the war, he published a paper on the periodic table of elements in an English-language evening newspaper in Shanghai and sent letters to chemists in various countries, requesting their advice. Scientific experts from various countries discussed this paper extensively, considering it to have considerable research value. After the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, Zhejiang University moved from Hangzhou to Yanzhou, and then twice to Zunyi in Guizhou. Mr. Zhou continued to teach at Zhejiang University, and it seems that Mr. Feng Zikai mentioned him in his "Teacher's Diary."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou also conducted research on agricultural chemistry. While at Zhejiang University, the authorities specially built a dedicated research lab for him. I heard that he also taught at a certain specialized college in Guizhou Province, but I'm unsure if this is accurate. Later, he was sent to England by the Ministry of Education to study electrical engineering and only returned to China in February of this year. The Associated Press reporter said that during his studies in England, his life was extraordinarily frugal. When he returned to China, he was even penniless in Calcutta and only managed to travel with the help of a friend. Scholars who are as self-motivated and hardworking as Mr. Zhou are rarely seen.</p>
