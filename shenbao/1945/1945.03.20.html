<p>日大本營發表　東京十九日中央社電　日大本營十九日下午四時半發表：（一）日軍航空部隊刻正團攻十八晟出現於九州東南海面之敵機動部隊，十八日內所獲之戰果中，迄今業經判明者如次：擊沉制式航空母艦一艘，航空母艦或戰艦一艘，戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，擊破制式航空母艦一艘。此外，尙有以拼撞攻擊而未經確認之相當戰果，擊落敵機四十六架（包含地上部隊之戰果），日方除有若干未蹄還之飛機以外，地上設施之損害極微。（二）敵機動部隊於本日晨，繼續其空襲之舉，陸續來襲四國及大阪，神戶等地方。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　十八日出現於九州近海之敵機動部隊，由上午六時至下午五時之間，先後以艦載機一千四百架，對九州南部及東部飛機塲波狀攻擊。同時，敵機之一部，對九州東半部之市區加以轟炸，並用機搶掃射。另一部少數敵機，曾往襲四國及和歌山縣南部北部，少數敵機其目的似在牽制日航空部隊之增援。九州日航空部隊隨地邀擊奮戰，上午査明之戰果，計擊落敵機十九架，另擊傷二架。又日軍航空部隊十八日未明攻擊敵機動部隊，似收獲相當戰果。</p>

<p>東京十九日中央社電　硫黃島之日軍，以寡敵衆，斃敵約三萬三千餘，奮戰一月後，玉名山地區之精銳部隊，八日夜斷然突入敵軍陣地，至十三日，日軍實行總攻擊，北部落及東山附近之日軍部隊堅守陣地，栗林最高指揮官下令作最後之反攻。</p>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　美太平洋艦隊司令部十六日發表稱：硫黃島美海軍之損害總數，達一萬九千九百三十八名。據美聯社大宮島基地十七日消息稱，美軍於硫黃島登陸作戰以來，迄今二十六日內，美海軍死傷達總數之百分之四十五，平均每日死傷七百六十六名，二分鐘一名，美軍當局因不能諱飾該項損失，不得已而如數發表，預料今後之損害當更形增大。</p>
<p>美軍作戰損失重大　中央社訊　二月十九日美軍在硫黃島登陸以來，截至三月十三日止，傷亡人數共三萬一千九百人，平均每日一千三百八十七人，每小時五十八人。以平均面積計，每方哩（硫黃島面積爲　八。五方哩）之傷亡人數，達三千七百五十人，可謂世界戰史中空前未有之量大損失也。然美當局因恐引起國民惡劣影響，虛報其數如下：太平洋美陸海軍之損失數，共計五萬三千七百七十人，爲美軍攻擊硫黃島在太平洋作戰中付出最大代價，在該島從事作戰之兵力總計六萬一千人，傷亡人數佔其百分之三十二·六，比較培里硫島之損失百分之二十四。九，塞班島之百分之二十三·六，達拉瓦島之百分之十八·六等數，大有增加云云。觀察以上統計，可知美軍愈接近日本本國，則其損失亦愈大，故美軍今後作戰不能不犧牲更多數軍隊。</p>

<h3 id="c10">申論慈善機關實施疏散辦法 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>本市人口疏散問題，已經由倡議成爲　事實，市府組織人口疏散委員會，聘請各界人士及有關機關當局擔任委員，該會並於本月一日起開始辦公，積極推進。昨天由該會執行組與社會福利局會同召集本市各慈善機關代表開會，今天由該會聯絡組與社會福利局會同召集各旅滬同鄉會代表開會，均爲　商討實施疏散問題。</p>
<p>就昨天執行組召集慈善機關的會議以觀，疏散委員會決定各慈善機關首先疏散。我們早曾主張，慈善機關並無留置本市市區的必要。無論爲安全爲經濟爲環境着想，都以遷移鄉區爲宜，根據執行組主任顧繼武氏報吿，我們對於各慈善機關願再質獻一言。</p>
<p>（一）關於疏散地點問題，疏散委員會已假定選擇洞庭山一地，正在調査接洽，如宗敎相同之慈善機關，在內地置有房屋田地者，應相互協助借用，以減輕疏散委員會之責任。</p>
<p>（二）現已規定一個月爲遷移準備時期，在此一個月中應對疏散工作迅速準備，例如整理必須挑帶之用具，愈簡單愈好。凡職工中有不願隨同疏散者，應即妥善解散，但以不留滯上海爲原則。</p>
<p>（三）關於交通問題，疏散委員會雖有船車供給，但各慈善機關應盡可能自動設法舟車，或組織步行隊，減少疏散委員會之賣任。</p>
<p>（四）宗敎相同及性質相類之慈善機關，允應彼此推誠商量合併，即性質不同者，也須彼此合作，互相照顧。例如有十單位同時疏散，如能以同性質者併成五單位或七單位時，即可比例減少疏散會工作，同時，亦即使疏散工作可以迅速。決不能以爲疏散會負責運轍及經費以後，即存依賴心理，仍持過去各自爲政的門戶之見。</p>
<p>（五）過去各慈善機關共同顧慮者有二點：一爲　疏散以後的維持及給養問題，一爲　疏散以後原有房屋生財的保管問題。現在疏散委員會對此兩點已有切實解決辦法，第一，疏散到達目的地以後，食糧及最低限度經費，由市府組織籌募委員會，負責統籌分配補助，不使有後顧之憂，但補助經費僅以養老慈幼殘廢聾啞機關爲限，宗敎團體除外，而上述補助機關中，如有全部或一部自給能力者，亦常斟酌實情合理分配。第二，在滬房產保管問題，已由顧主任在第六款中詳細說明。但在戰時環境下，縱不遷移而在軍事上必要徵用時，亦無可推辭。</p>
<p>總之，目前在實施疏散工作中，最爲　重要者還在交通問題，有了疏散的準備，有了疏散的目的地，如果沒有充分的交通工具，還是無從疏散的。除了各慈善機關應先疏散外，自願疏散歸鄕的爲　數很多，這一般人只待交通問題的解決，別無問題。現在疏散委員會之下，專設的陸路與航路專門委員會，允應積極展開工作，而且必須切實工作。聞水道方面，以寗波，江北，蘇州，杭州四處爲　疏散路綫，由東亞海運公司，中華輪船公司，內河輪船公司供給船隻，由市政府供給煤斤，那末，在客觀上對於交通問題之解決，亦有確切把握。至於陸路方面，由疏散委員會自辦運輸，租用或徵用車輛，盡量利用滬錫公路及各支路綫。疏散運輸，無論陸路航路，均應行駛專輪或專車，不與普通旅客相雜。我們所以如此主張者，因爲　疏散專車或專輪，可由軍警沿途保護，不受車站碼頭之意外留難，或各地檢問所之麻煩檢査，可收時間迅速之效。如與普通旅客混雜，非普通單帮旅客利用疏散名義作弊，即疏散人員受普通旅客檢査遲滯影響。</p>

<p>柏林十九日中央社電　海通社訊：上西里西亞工業區南部，現展開激戰，蘇軍新攻勢開始在斯伐資瓦塞兩側與格洛特高兩處分別進攻，其目的殆在梅里希·奧斯特勞工業區，但終被德軍阻止。自拉的波爾前進之蘇軍，滲入里奧勃許資區，格洛特高迤南地區則被錯形行動之北路部隊所制，以圖進取沃特河西岸奧普恩對岸之德軍據點，蘇軍雖集中大量裝甲車隊參加此役，但其席捲該區德軍陣地之企圖卒未成功。敵方現調集更多軍隊與戰具參加作戰，惟戰事尙未抵達最高點。東綫北路亦有大戰，蘇軍再攻斯丹丁亦遭抑止，故敵方企圖控制沃特河口之計劃已被粉碎。</p>

<p>『自由，解放！』－－英美軍這樣吶喊着，在意大利南部和法國北部，展開了歐洲侵攻作戰，但英美大軍所駐紥的許多國家，是否眞正得到了「自由解放」？在英美看來，摧毀德國的軍事機構，固然重要，但更重要者，乃是使全部歐洲成爲英美的經濟奴隸。當許多國家筋疲力竭的時候，聽到「借錢和援助物資」這樣美麗中聰的字句，立刻投入英美的懷抱，然而投降後再仔細一看，英美已經不是那副僞善面孔了。現在更與前此所應諾者不同了。</p>
<p>濫發軍票</p>
<p>一國軍隊進攻其他國家時，行使責任明確的軍票爲當時的通貨，這固屬當然，但英美軍在意大利南部及法國北部登陸時所發行的軍票，最初就是想犧牲被侵略國民的毒辣工具。</p>
<p>前年七月，在意大利登陸時，使里拉幣的兌換率貶値百分之八十三，而發行軍票當作意大利的國幣。至去年八月，曾濫發了八百七十五億里拉的所謂意大利國幣。然而這種軍票上面印着「意大利發行」的字樣，可見當初的起意便不想負收回的責任。</p>
<p>意大利波諾米政欋是否滿意這一點呢？當時曾向英美要求等於佔領費負担額的借款，所以羅斯福曾解釋以借款收回軍票。但收回的時候，軍票發行的負担，自然全部放在意大利人民肩上。此外諾曼第登陸時，曾使用過所謂「侵入法郞」這樣的軍票。這是美國印刷的，票面上印着「一九四四年法蘭西發行」的字樣，共有二法郞至五千法郞的八種鈔票，總額爲　八百二十億法郞。特戈爾政權在巴黎建立起來後，對於這種軍票締結過下列妥協條件。</p>
<p>（一）通貨發行權移交特戈爾政欋。</p>
<p>（二）英美軍發行的通貨，由特戈爾政權承受，新通貨發行時，須與此種通貨交換。</p>
<p>（三）但前此發行額與今後英美軍支出額，將成爲英美政府的債務。</p>
<p>兌換率是按去年二月在阿爾及爾所締結的英法協定比例，但該兌換率比戰前對英降低了百分之十二，對美降低了百分之八。</p>
<p>一個美金等於五十法郞。</p>
<p>一個英磅等於二百法郞。</p>
<p>雖然曾這樣的規定，但由於惡性通貨膨脹的結果，業已降低了很多，所以至去年底，一個英磅等於九百法郞了。利時的情形，是比利時流亡政府供給英美軍隊所必要的一切通貨，這是因爲英美軍替比利時與德國作戰的關係。比利時供給英美的貨幣有逃亡時帶出國外的老紙幣，以及在倫敦印發的新紙幣，在美國鑄造的新硬幣等。此外關於荷蘭，因爲流亡政府和英美軍都沒有準備荷蘭通貨，所以一時只好忍受而使用比利時法郞。因此，各地軍票充斥，正如江河之決堤，而被惡性通貨膨脹所籠罩了。</p>
<p>物價飛騰</p>
<p>意我們首先檢討一下意大利的實際情况。所謂里拉幣貶値百分之八十三的意思，就是等於一百元改爲十七元。八百七十五億里拉的軍票外，按去年底的調査，還有二千六百億的老里拉幣。自然，這樣決不會有健全的國民生活。</p>
<p>物價飛漲，這是毫無例外的，例如意大利的名產通心粉，甚至比戰前指數貴了一百十倍。鷄蛋一個値三十五里拉，白糖一公斤四百里拉，牛奶油一公斤三百五十里拉，白麵包一磅四十五里拉，皮鞋一雙五千里拉－－這是去年秋天的市價。但是工人一天勞動的收入，是三十里拉，僅僅能買一個鷄蛋。</p>
<p>雖說同是意大利南部，但羅馬·那波利·弗羅倫斯等大都市，悲慘得尤其驚人。羅馬市的平時人口爲　一百萬人，但難民突然增加了一倍成爲二百萬人。食糧產區的意大利北部，却在戰火的燃燒下，前此英美軍曾答應「如投降則贈與麵包和肉」，然而不僅不實行諾言，反來到處搜刮軍糧。如每個市民每日最小限度的食糧配給量爲　二百兩，二百萬市民一個月的食糧五萬噸，則必須有保證，但實際上只配給二萬噸。就是這樣，大部份食糧也成爲囤積的對象了。（未完）</p>

<p>我們準備舉辦義務小學，目的是希望做到使失業敎師敎育失學兒童。我們知道這件工作是非常艱巨的，決不是一個團體少數人的力量所可擔當的。不過，我們準備以全副精力，至少可以負起溝通和媒介的任務，就是引起社會同情我們這一工作的力量，依照我們的工作步驟，向目標邁進，社會的力量愈大，工作的成就也愈大。</p>
<p>第一件使我們增加信心與毅力的，就是讀者的紛紛同情贊助。謝立林君倡議設立「義學金」，並首捐一萬元後，昨天即有幾位讀者表示熱烈響應。情詞很爲感動，節載來信如下：</p>
<p>（一）康益時裝公司一職員周國雄君來函說：「讀了謝君給貴報的信後，眞使我感動萬分，在今日生活的迫逼之下，失學兒童，何止千萬，誰無兒女，　之殊堪痛心。我是個小職員—所謂薪水階級，生活的艱困，也是可想而知了。今天讀了信後，回想到幾百年前行乞興學的武訓，眞正令人汗顏。於是，不目量力，在極困苦的生活費用中抽出一部份（計中儲券二千元），奉獻給貴報，作爲「義學金」。所謂：「涓涓細流，無補大川」，這不過是表示我的寸衷罷了！」</p>
<p>（二）天潼路綠寶烟號失學學徒蔡何康君函說：「我今天看了你們要辦理義務小學校，和謝立林先生發起徵募「義學金」的消息，使我非常快樂，因爲我自己也是個爲了生活而失學的孩子。我時常要想讀書，可是沒機會，同時也可以想到在這樣高壓的生活下，像我這樣的人，不知有多少。現在你們辦了義務小學，就有了入學的機會，那是多麽好的事情。不過我想失學的人旣然這麽多，決計不是十所學校所能容納，希望你們趕快多辦一些，現在我把每天節省下來的一千元，獻作「義學金」。並且希望社會上熱心的人，快起來響應，救救我們這般失學的苦孩子吧！」</p>

<p>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement. Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 19th: (1) Japanese air units are currently engaging an enemy task force of approximately 18 ships appearing southeast of Kyushu. As of the 18th, the confirmed results of the battle are as follows: one standard aircraft carrier sunk, one aircraft carrier or battleship sunk, one battleship or cruiser sunk, two destroyers sunk, and one standard aircraft carrier damaged. In addition, there are unconfirmed, significant results from ramming attacks. Forty-six enemy aircraft were shot down (including results from ground units). Except for a few planes that have not returned, damage to Japanese ground facilities is minimal. (2) This morning, the enemy task force continued its air raids, attacking Shikoku, Osaka, Kobe, and other areas in waves.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy task force that appeared off the coast of Kyushu on the 18th launched 1,400 carrier-based aircraft in waves against airfields in southern and eastern Kyushu between 6:00 AM and 5:00 PM. Simultaneously, a portion of the enemy aircraft bombed urban areas in the eastern half of Kyushu and strafed them with machine guns. Another small number of enemy aircraft attacked Shikoku and the southern and northern parts of Wakayama Prefecture, seemingly to divert Japanese air reinforcements. Japanese air units in Kyushu engaged the enemy and fought fiercely. The confirmed results as of the morning were 19 enemy aircraft shot down and two damaged. Furthermore, Japanese air units attacked the enemy task force before dawn on the 18th, seemingly achieving considerable results.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, facing overwhelming odds, have inflicted approximately 33,000 enemy casualties. After a month of fierce fighting, elite units in the Mt. Suribachi area decisively broke into enemy lines on the night of the 8th. By the 13th, Japanese forces launched a general attack. Japanese units in the northern part of the island and near Mt. Higashi held their ground, and Supreme Commander Kuribayashi ordered a final counterattack.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced on the 16th that total U.S. Navy casualties on Iwo Jima have reached 19,938. According to an Associated Press report from Guam on the 17th, U.S. Navy casualties since the landing operation on Iwo Jima have reached 45% of the total force in 26 days, averaging 766 casualties per day, or one every two minutes. Unable to conceal these losses, the U.S. military authorities have been forced to release the figures. Further increases in casualties are expected.</p>
<p>Heavy U.S. Operational Losses - Central News Agency Report - Since the U.S. landing on Iwo Jima on February 19th, as of March 13th, total casualties have reached 31,900, averaging 1,387 per day, or 58 per hour. Averaging the casualties by area, there have been 3,750 casualties per square mile (Iwo Jima has an area of 8.5 square miles), representing an unprecedented level of losses in world military history. However, fearing a negative impact on public opinion, the U.S. authorities have underreported the numbers as follows: total U.S. Army and Navy losses in the Pacific are 53,770. This is the greatest price the U.S. military has paid in the Pacific campaign to capture Iwo Jima. The total number of troops engaged on the island is 61,000, with casualties accounting for 32.6% of the force, compared to 24.9% at Peleliu, 23.6% at Saipan, and 18.6% at Tarawa. These figures show a significant increase. Observing these statistics, it is clear that the closer the U.S. military gets to the Japanese mainland, the greater its losses will be. Therefore, future U.S. operations will inevitably require sacrificing even more troops.</p>

<p>Central News Agency Report - According to an announcement by the Pacific Fleet Command, U.S. forces murdered 12,000 Japanese civilians on Saipan after occupying the island. Americans have always adhered to a belief in white supremacy, viewing people of color as inferior races. Therefore, their murder of people of non-white races is akin to slaughtering animals. Their inhumane behavior has reached its extreme. In the past, during the Opium War, there were instances of murdering Chinese people. More recently, they bombed Chinese civilians in peaceful areas. Their cruel methods against non-combatants are too numerous to mention.</p>

In this way, the people can have a clear guideline. If I do not integrate the people into the war as one, the war cannot continue. I deeply agree with your valuable opinion. Regarding producing soldiers, I also hope that efforts will be made to make it a part of the operational goals."</p>

<h3 id="e10">On Implementing Evacuation Measures for Charitable Institutions <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>The issue of population evacuation in this city has moved from a proposal to a reality. The municipal government has organized a Population Evacuation Committee, inviting individuals from all walks of life and relevant authorities to serve as members. The committee began operations on the first of this month, actively promoting the evacuation. Yesterday, the executive group of the committee and the Bureau of Social Welfare jointly convened a meeting of representatives from charitable institutions in the city. Today, the liaison group of the committee and the Bureau of Social Welfare jointly convened a meeting of representatives from various Shanghai native-place associations, all to discuss the implementation of evacuation measures.</p>
<p>Based on yesterday's meeting of charitable institutions convened by the executive group, the Evacuation Committee has decided that charitable institutions should be evacuated first. We have long argued that charitable institutions have no need to remain in the city center. Whether for safety, economic, or environmental reasons, it is advisable to move to rural areas. Based on the report of Gu Jiwu, director of the executive group, we would like to offer the following suggestions to the charitable institutions:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the location of evacuation, the Evacuation Committee has tentatively chosen Dongting Mountain and is currently investigating and negotiating. If charitable institutions of the same religion own houses and land in the interior, they should assist each other in borrowing them to reduce the responsibility of the Evacuation Committee.</p>
<p>(2) It has been stipulated that there is one month for the preparation of the evacuation. During this month, the evacuation work should be prepared quickly, such as sorting out the necessary utensils to be carried, the simpler the better. Any employees who are unwilling to evacuate should be properly dismissed, but with the principle of not staying in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding transportation, although the Evacuation Committee will provide boats and vehicles, charitable institutions should try their best to find transportation on their own or organize marching teams to reduce the Evacuation Committee's responsibility.</p>
<p>(4) Charitable institutions of the same religion and similar nature should sincerely discuss merging with each other. Even those of different natures should also cooperate and take care of each other. For example, if ten units are evacuated at the same time, if they can be merged into five or seven units of the same nature, the work of the Evacuation Committee can be reduced proportionally. At the same time, the evacuation work can be speeded up. It is absolutely impossible to rely on the Evacuation Committee for transportation and expenses and still hold the past parochial views of each acting on its own.</p>
<p>(5) In the past, there were two common concerns among charitable institutions: one was the maintenance and sustenance after evacuation, and the other was the safekeeping of the original real estate after evacuation. Now the Evacuation Committee has effective solutions to these two points. First, after arriving at the destination of evacuation, the municipal government will organize a fundraising committee to take responsibility for the unified distribution of food and the minimum necessary funds, so that there will be no worries about the future. However, the subsidy funds are only limited to institutions for the elderly, orphans, disabled, and deaf-mute. Religious organizations are excluded, and among the aforementioned subsidized institutions, those that have full or partial self-sufficiency capabilities will also be rationally allocated based on the actual situation. Second, Director Gu has explained in detail the issue of property custody in Shanghai in Section 6. However, in a wartime environment, even if there is no relocation and it is necessary to requisition for military purposes, it is impossible to refuse.</p>
<p>In short, the most important thing in the implementation of evacuation work at present is still the issue of transportation. With the preparation for evacuation and the destination of evacuation, it is still impossible to evacuate without sufficient means of transportation. In addition to the charitable institutions that should be evacuated first, there are many people who voluntarily evacuate back to their hometowns. These people are only waiting for the solution to the transportation problem, and there is no other problem. Now, under the Evacuation Committee, there are specialized committees for land and water transportation, which should actively carry out their work and must work effectively. It is reported that the waterways are based on Ningbo, Jiangbei, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, with the East Asia Shipping Company, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Inland River Shipping Company providing ships, and the municipal government providing coal. Then, objectively, there is a definite grasp of solving the transportation problem. As for land transportation, the Evacuation Committee will handle the transportation itself, renting or requisitioning vehicles, and making full use of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway and its branch lines. Evacuation transportation, whether by land or water, should be carried out by special trains or special ships, without mixing with ordinary passengers. The reason why we advocate this is that evacuation special trains or ships can be protected by the military and police along the way, and will not be unexpectedly delayed at stations and docks, or be bothered by inspections at checkpoints in various places, which can save time quickly. If mixed with ordinary passengers, either ordinary single-gang passengers will take advantage of the evacuation name to cheat, or the evacuation personnel will be delayed and affected by the inspection of ordinary passengers.</p>

Regarding the election of representatives from the North, the New People's Society was instructed to actively assist. The New People's Society believes that this measure is necessary to express the true will of the people, so it has been actively carried out, and it has been decided that the New People's Society's provincial and municipal associations will select, from among the representatives of the annual provincial and municipal joint associations, those who meet the purpose of directly representing the people, and will ensure that they all come to Nanjing to participate before the meeting."</p>

<p>Macau, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports: Chongqing news: The delegation sent by the Chongqing government to the San Francisco Conference has not yet been announced. It is feared that Song Ziwen will be the chief representative, and the remaining members are still under consideration. The unofficial list of members is roughly as follows: Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council; Gu Weijun, Ambassador to the United Kingdom; Wei Daoming, Ambassador to the United States; Shang Zhen, Head of the Chinese Military Mission to the United States; Hu Shize, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Xu Mo, Minister to Australia; Zhang Junmai, leader of the National Socialist Party. It is likely that General Chiang Kai-shek will not attend, but Chongqing officials remain silent on this matter. The National Congress of the Kuomintang has been set for May 5, at which time Chiang will have to attend in person.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Germany Again Denies Seeking Peace with Britain and the United States <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports: German political reports state that newspapers in various countries are spreading rumors that Germany is exploring peace, or that General Rundstedt, commander-in-chief of the German forces on the Western Front, has requested an armistice from General Eisenhower, or that German personnel stationed in Sweden have contacted personnel at the British Embassy in Sweden, suggesting a separate peace with Western countries. German officials have denied these rumors, denouncing them as attempts to frustrate Germany's will to fight. The anti-Axis powers are using psychological warfare and terror bombing to assist military operations, knowing full well that Germany will not be defeated militarily. Propaganda that the enemy is weary of war and seeking peace is a common tactic in wartime. This propaganda can reduce the enemy's self-confidence, while encouraging war-weary people in one's own country by the enemy's search for peace. The current rumors that Germany is suggesting peace also serve the above purpose. However, German leaders and the public have understood the enemy's purpose and the anti-Axis powers' principle of unconditional surrender. Germany will never forget the statements made by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin regarding armistice and peace, and Germany will not accept these conditions of national destruction. The German people are willing to perish together with the enemy.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a London dispatch: Yesterday, the U.S. Strategic Air Force, escorted by 700 fighters, used 1,300 Flying Fortresses to carry out a daylight bombing of Berlin, dropping a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs on Berlin's central train station and military factories in the suburbs. German air defense was also fierce.

<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports: Fierce fighting is currently unfolding in the southern part of the Upper Silesian industrial area. The new Soviet offensive began on both sides of Schwersenz (Zweierzähl) and near Grottkau, with the aim of targeting the Mährisch-Ostrau industrial area, but it was ultimately blocked by German forces. The Soviet army, advancing from Ratibor, infiltrated the Leobschütz district. The area south of Grottkau was controlled by the northern forces of the German army, aiming to take the German strongholds on the opposite bank of the Oder River, opposite Oppeln. Although the Soviet army concentrated a large number of armored vehicles in this battle, its attempt to sweep through the German positions in the area ultimately failed. The enemy is now gathering more troops and weapons to participate in the operation, but the war has not yet reached its climax. There is also a major battle on the northern section of the Eastern Front. The Soviet army's repeated attacks on Stettin were also suppressed, so the enemy's plan to control the mouth of the Oder River has been thwarted.</p>

<p>"Freedom, Liberation!"--The British and American armies shouted these slogans as they launched their European invasion campaigns in southern Italy and northern France. But have the many countries where the British and American forces are stationed truly gained "freedom and liberation"? In the eyes of Britain and America, destroying Germany's military apparatus is certainly important, but what is more important is making all of Europe their economic slave. When many countries are exhausted, they immediately throw themselves into the embrace of Britain and America upon hearing the beautiful and tempting words of "loans and aid supplies." However, after surrendering and taking a closer look, Britain and America are no longer wearing that hypocritical mask. They are now different from what they promised before.</p>
<p>Abuse of Military Scrip</p>
<p>When an army of one country invades another, it is of course natural to use military scrip with clearly defined responsibilities as the currency of the time. However, the military scrip issued by the British and American forces when they landed in southern Italy and northern France was initially intended as a vicious tool to sacrifice the invaded people.</p>
<p>When landing in Italy in July of the year before last, the exchange rate of the lira was devalued by 83 percent, and military scrip was issued as the national currency of Italy. By August of last year, a total of 87.5 billion lire of so-called Italian national currency had been issued indiscriminately. However, this military scrip was printed with the words "Issued by Italy," which shows that the initial intention was not to take responsibility for its redemption.</p>
<p>Is the Italian Bonomi government satisfied with this? At that time, it had requested loans from Britain and America equivalent to the occupation expenses, so Roosevelt explained that the military scrip would be redeemed with loans. However, when it comes to redemption, the burden of issuing the military scrip will naturally fall entirely on the shoulders of the Italian people. In addition, so-called "invasion francs" were used during the Normandy landings. These were printed in the United States, with the words "Issued by France in 1944" on the banknotes. There were eight denominations, ranging from 2 to 5,000 francs, with a total value of 82 billion francs. After the de Gaulle government was established in Paris, the following compromise conditions were concluded regarding this military scrip.</p>
<p>(1) The right to issue currency is transferred to the de Gaulle government.</p>
<p>(2) The currency issued by the British and American forces will be accepted by the de Gaulle government, and new currency must be exchanged for this currency when it is issued.</p>
<p>(3) However, the amount previously issued and the amount of future expenditures by the British and American forces will become debts of the British and American governments.</p>
<p>The exchange rate is based on the ratio of the Anglo-French agreement concluded in Algiers in February of last year, but that exchange rate was 12 percent lower against the pound and 8 percent lower against the dollar than before the war.</p>
<p>One US dollar equals 50 francs.</p>
<p>One British pound equals 200 francs.</p>
<p>Although such regulations were made, the results of runaway inflation have already reduced these amounts significantly, so that by the end of last year, one British pound equaled 900 francs. In the case of Belgium, the Belgian government-in-exile supplied the British and American troops with all the necessary currency because the British and American forces were fighting Germany for Belgium. The currency supplied by Belgium to Britain and America included old banknotes taken abroad during the exile, as well as new banknotes printed in London and new coins minted in the United States. In addition, regarding the Netherlands, because neither the government-in-exile nor the British and American forces had prepared Dutch currency, they had to endure and use Belgian francs for a while. As a result, military scrip flooded everywhere, like a river breaking its banks, and was enveloped by runaway inflation.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices</p>
<p>Let us first examine the actual situation in Italy. The so-called devaluation of the lira by 83 percent means that 100 yuan is equivalent to changing to 17 yuan. In addition to the 87.5 billion lire in military scrip, according to a survey at the end of last year, there were also 260 billion old lire banknotes. Naturally, there will never be a healthy national life under these conditions.</p>
<p>There is no exception to the skyrocketing prices. For example, the price of macaroni, a famous Italian product, is even 110 times higher than the pre-war index. An egg costs 35 lire, a kilogram of white sugar costs 400 lire, a kilogram of butter costs 350 lire, a pound of white bread costs 45 lire, and a pair of leather shoes costs 5,000 lire--these were the market prices in the autumn of last year. However, a worker's daily income is 30 lire, which is only enough to buy one egg.</p>
<p>Although it is all southern Italy, the misery of major cities such as Rome, Naples, and Florence is particularly shocking. The normal population of Rome is 1 million, but the number of refugees suddenly doubled to 2 million. Northern Italy, the food-producing area, is burning in the flames of war. Previously, the British and American forces had promised "If you surrender, we will give you bread and meat," but not only did they not fulfill their promise, but they came to loot military food everywhere. For example, if the minimum daily food ration for each citizen is 200 liang, then the monthly food ration for 2 million citizens is 50,000 tons, which must be guaranteed, but in reality, only 20,000 tons are distributed. Even so, most of the food has become the object of hoarding. (To be continued)</p>

It is also learned that the China Industrial Association, in view of the current active evacuation of people in Shanghai and the authorities' current preparation for factory evacuation, which is a very important issue at present, has decided to convene leaders of industrial factories throughout the city on the 22nd of this month to hold a discussion meeting to discuss the progress.</p>

<p>In order to rectify the registration of various industries and businesses, the Municipal Economic Bureau stipulates that each manufacturer must apply for registration in person by the manager or person in charge, and those who have already applied and approved registration in the past can quickly go to obtain the registration license with their receipts. Recently, industries and businesses have been enthusiastically following the procedures, but it has been found that some manufacturers' declarations do not match the facts, and they have been ordered to re-apply truthfully. It is learned that the bureau had previously ordered the registration of various factories in the city to be completed by the end of this month. Those who have not applied for registration after the deadline will be punished according to law.</p>

<p>The city's Finance Bureau has been handling the collection of this year's spring business tax recently, and the work is extremely busy.

Therefore, yesterday, non-trade association member businesses and foreign expatriate businesses, companies, and foreign firms enthusiastically reported to the bureau. Trade association members who reported can completely submit their reports today and await investigation and taxation. It is learned that all businesses, factories, and companies within the six districts stipulated by the bureau that have not reported should report in accordance with the regulations on this last day. Otherwise, if they miss the deadline, the bureau will punish them for resisting and failing to report. In particular, the total amount of business tax reported by various industries should be based on the actual amount for January and February of this year, and the amount for March should be reported together based on the average actual amount for the above-mentioned January and February. Conversely, if the reported amount is not reasonable or does not match the facts, the bureau will pay special attention to investigating it, and if it is found that the reported amount is false, it will be treated as underreporting. Regarding the investigation work, it is planned to start a comprehensive investigation next Monday after the training of the trainees is completed. At that time, the investigation and tax payment work will be conducted in groups in six districts, including the city center, Madang Road, Taishan Road, Huxi, Zhabei, and Hongkou, and the tax collection period should be completed before the end of this month in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Increasing Confidence and Perseverance: Readers Enthusiastically Respond to Charity School Fund <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Our preparation to establish a free primary school aims to allow unemployed teachers to educate out-of-school children. We know this undertaking is exceptionally difficult and cannot be shouldered by a single organization or a small number of people. However, we are prepared to dedicate our full energy, at least to take on the task of communication and mediation, that is, to arouse the power of society to sympathize with our work and advance towards the goal according to our work steps. The greater the power of society, the greater the achievement of the work.</p>
<p>The first thing that increases our confidence and perseverance is the enthusiastic sympathy and support from readers. Following Mr. Xie Lilin's proposal to establish a "Charity School Fund" and his initial donation of ten thousand yuan, several readers expressed their enthusiastic support yesterday. The sentiments expressed were very moving, and excerpts from their letters are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhou Guoxiong, an employee of Kangyi Fashion Company, wrote: "After reading Mr. Xie's letter to your newspaper, I was deeply moved. In today's pressing circumstances, there are countless out-of-school children. Who doesn't have children? This situation is truly heartbreaking. I am a small employee – a so-called wage earner. The difficulties of life are imaginable. After reading the letter today, I thought of Wu Xun, who begged to establish schools hundreds of years ago, and I am truly ashamed. Therefore, without overestimating my abilities, I extracted a portion (estimated at two thousand yuan in Central Reserve Certificates) from my extremely difficult living expenses to contribute to your newspaper as a 'Charity School Fund.' As the saying goes, 'A small stream cannot replenish a great river.' This is just to express my sincerity!"</p>
<p>(2) Cai Hekang, an out-of-school apprentice at the Lvbao Tobacco Shop on Tiantong Road, wrote: "Today I saw the news that you are going to run a free primary school and that Mr. Xie Lilin has launched a campaign to raise a 'Charity School Fund,' which made me very happy because I am also a child who dropped out of school due to life's hardships. I often want to study, but I don't have the opportunity. At the same time, I can imagine that under such oppressive living conditions, there are countless people like me. Now that you have established a free primary school, there is an opportunity to enroll, which is such a good thing. However, I think that since there are so many out-of-school people, ten schools will definitely not be able to accommodate them all. I hope you will open more schools quickly. Now I am donating one thousand yuan that I save every day as a 'Charity School Fund.' And I hope that enthusiastic people in society will quickly respond and save us poor out-of-school children!"</p>
<p>(3) A small female porter wrote: "Today I saw the news in your newspaper about the establishment of a free school, and I was very happy. Because I am also one of the out-of-school children. Now, forced by life, I have to go to the Jing-Hu Railway to work as a porter. Fortunately, it has been going well recently, so I will donate two thousand yuan of pocket money saved today as a 'Charity School Fund.' Although this amount is very small, I hope that your newspaper will do its best to solicit donations from all enthusiastic people so that many free primary schools can be established. Then, maybe I can also enter a free primary school in the future, be able to get the hope of studying, and no longer suffer from the pain of dropping out of school!"</p>
<p>The above three letters, especially the latter two, judging from the handwriting and sentences in the original letters, are full of extremely pure and sympathetic enthusiasm. Although their donations are not large, their value of sympathy is extremely high, so we are happy to publish them. Of course, we also hope for large donations from other powerful individuals.</p>

<p>(1) Donation of Smoking Cessation Medicine: A letter from the Hua Sheng Pharmaceutical Research Institute stated: "In your column on March 3, you published 'The Nanshi Sanatorium has an affiliated Poverty-Stricken Smoking Cessation Department, dedicated to helping poor young professionals quit their addiction,' which is extremely sympathetic. Our institute's smoking cessation injection 'Shengkang Doping' is sent with 1,500 injections, enough for 100 people to use, please forward it to the hospital." (Note: This office has notified the Nanshi Sanatorium to pick it up at our office.)</p>
