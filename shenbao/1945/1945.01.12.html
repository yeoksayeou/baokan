<p>南京十一日中央社電增加生產爲改善民生增强戰力之先決條件，故國府自數年以來，即以此爲施政重點，傾舉全力以謀推進。關於最近三年度之增產實續，暨本年度之推進方針亦深爲各方所關懷。中央社記者此往訪以實業部次長姜佐宣氏，承扼要談稱如次：</p>
<p>去年度農業管理偏重於實騐工作，米麥雜糧等之實騐成績，尚稱完善，林墾育苗等則注重於面積之拓展，惟上項工作幷非一蹴而成，幾需積年累月，方能見效。至於今年度之農業增產推進方針，首爲簡素實施機構，因以往之農業改進區，林懇示範塲，育苗塲，棉種繁殖塲等，名目林立，以致人力經費，兩具分散，實爲不能收獲預期效果之最大原因，故今年決加以調整合併，尤其在偏重地區及治安欠妥之處，決予緩辦。其次，爲置重推廣工作，將改騐成功之優良品種，儘量推廣冀收增產實效。又本年度農業增產經費，亦經決定，比去年約增三倍。</p>
<p>工業增產</p>
<p>關於工業增產工作，本已於本年制定日用品指定生產實施綱要公佈施行，今年繼續强調該綱要之實施，務使經指定之日用品生產廠，能按預定目標生產。至各工廠所需原料及動力，當設法予以合理配給。至礦業增產，固亦爲不可忽視之工作，目前華中一帶小型礦山均在積極開發中，饅頭山煤礦最近並增添一新幷，如可能實現，則祇此一處，即可日增煤斤百噸以上，對工業用煤及民用燃料，當有莫大之貢獻。</p>

<h3 id="c7">德國大使館茶會印象記 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者澹明</p>
<p>民國三十四年的新年，國府要人正忙着凖備新的努力，隨着上海市府人事　新，首都反形沉寂起來。反之德國因歐洲西綫戰事的重趨活躍，去年十二月十六日倫德斯台特元帥的強力反攻，透露出軸心國勝利的新曙光，於是首都德國駐華大使館，乘着新年佳節於一月三日　待首都中外記者，舉行盛大茶會。記者適駐足京門，自不願失掉這樣一個富有意義的國際集會。</p>
<p>卍字旗下的官邸</p>
<p>德意志第三帝國，曾由其建國的歷史，更新了歐洲的命運，東亞時局也起着激烈的變化。在亞歐目的一致的生死搏鬥中，德國今後的非常遭遏當然是目前頂受注意的一件事。因此今天出席德使館茶會的記者十分踴躍，幾乎使寗海路德大使官邸擠　氣都透不過來。</p>
<p>走進華麗的客廳，看見一位穿着納粹少校軍服的人從裏面迎出來。原來便是最近從德國東來的賴上可以看出現代德國軍人的氣慨。接着又走進了許多德國使館的人員，值得注意的：一位是盟邦人氏呌笠置正明，是德使館秘書官；一位是我國同胞王裕光，是德使館秘書主任。王先生在北京政府時代曾任參謀本部高級官吏，且　當過陸軍大學敎官，門牆桃李都做了羅赫一時的軍人。聽說他到歐洲去時，還在遜淸時代，想不到在這裏遇到這樣一位留學界的老前輩。</p>
<p>遝有和我們安換名片的有：德國駐華公使郭德，秘書賀德，海通社南京分社經理涂倫德等。郭德公使曾在歐洲德。西。義。英。法五國讀書，讀過侃恩，佛朗克孚，巴薩朗那，羅馬，巴黎及倫敦六個大學，所以精通數國語言，後來曾在國際聯盟做過事，於兩年前來華，是位靑年有爲的外交家。涂倫德旅華很久，在華北曾有長時間的滯留，且於民國廿九至三十年間到過重慶，且位精通華語熟識東方事情的德國記者。不久走進了大使韋爾曼，同時我國和日本的記者也都入室，茶會於是開始。</p>
<p>韋爾曼大使的風采</p>
<p>首由韋爾曼大使作間短的歡迎辭，並介紹賴和德代理武官作戰局演講。韋氏聽說年齡已在花甲之外，可是面色豐潤，可看出是位富有生命力的納粹鬥士。他對於萊因河戰綫，洪牙利戰綫都作精確的報告。眞的，去歲十二月十六日所給予敵人的刺激，正是決戰最後階段的一個轉捩點。賴氏演講時，一面掛着東西二綫的地岡，表明演變中的戰局動態；一面更印發中日文的演辭譯文，所以即使不懂德語的我們也可以一目了然。</p>
<p>賴氏演辭歷四十分錢始畢，韋爾曼大使繼之作謙遜的謝辭，於是在人頭讚助中走進內室內茶點。記者首由郭德公使介紹與韋爾曼大使握手並致祝辭。在談話中知道韋爾曼大使說得一口流利的英語，後來知道他本是德國有數的英國通。據韋氏說，他乃是在民國卅二年七月底來華的，因交通不使，曾以潛艇駛亞，在馬來某地登陸後始換坐飛機，取道西寅和海南島來華。在　時韋氏曾任外交部政治司司長多年，是里賓特洛甫的輔弼。他知道我是申報記者，十分喜悅地和我交談，希望我以後常去作友誼的訪問。</p>
<p>兩位盟邦官員</p>
<p>茶話後，繼以進酒，主人要我們以極名貴的香檳和啤酒，佐以有名的魯式慶房所襲之各種三明治。正在這個時候，忽然有一位盟邦的官員走過來問我：「是澹明先生嗎」？「陳社長巳經和我們說了，所以我知這就是先生！」接着那位盟邦官員又客氣了一番。</p>
<p>事後知道，那位盟邦官員就是他們駐華大使館情報部秘書松尾先生。他和我介紹岸情報部長，岸氏身材不十分高，戴着一副有邊眼鏡，長得十分壯健，看上去有些像中國人，談鋒極健。此外在這次國際茶會中，選使我認識不少我國宣傳界人物，像范拂公先生，李更生女士，都是宣傳部有名的能員，賓主雙方須談到六時左右，始盡興而別。散會時，知道韋爾曼大使明晨就要到上海去。（寄自首都</p>

<h3 id="c8">上海臨時救濟難民協會成立 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>本市各界領袖及熱心公益人士，籌議組織之上海臨時救濟難民協會，已於前日舉行成立會，通過組織章程及主席團人選。實際工作，諒不久即可積極展開。</p>
<p>該會組織的目的以及工作方向，在組織章程第二條中已經明示，就是「辦理上海地區救濟遭遇災難人民」。誠如該會發起人李思浩氏在去年十二月十二日首次籌備會中設：「本市救濟工作非常需要，救濟工作有經常與臨時兩種，經常救濟工作已由各慈善團體分別主持辦理，臨時救濟工作需要舉辦者頗多又急。」我們可以更明白的說，所謂臨時救濟工作者，就是適應目前戰時的環境，敵人的飛機可能隨時空襲，盲目轟炸，因此遭遇災難的市民，木惻隱互助之心，自應加以援救。在這個目標之下，需要一個强有力的團體，負起救濟工作的任務。上海臨時救濟難民協會就是爲這個任務而產生，我們不勝寄予股切的期待。</p>
<p>現在該會已經成立了，我們對此略有一些感想和意見。我們常說社會工作應由社會領袖自動的負起責任。同時，對於政治工作沒有興趣，固然可以不入仕途，可是，對於社會工作，則不能不管，不能袖手旁觀，因爲任何人不能脫離社會而生活。如果社會上的公正人士，有聲望有地位的領袖抱着消極觀望的態度，那末，社會工作不是停滯，便是落於不正當人手中，於是社會就形成不安定的紊亂現象，這個時候，處身於這個社會的公正人士也必遭遇到同樣的不安，而不可能獨善其身。另一方面，社會工作有了公正人士領導進行，社會事業入了正軌，形成了正氣的力量，不但社會上惡勢力無法抬頭，從而安定社會，同時，更可以影響政治入於廉廉與淸明之途。惟有這樣積極的參加社會工作，才能實現社會公正領袖的本來志願。否則，消極的獨善其身，事實上是不可能的。</p>
<p>這次臨時救濟難民協會的發起與成立，顏惠慶氏的參與力量最大，困爲顏氏的領導，其餘幾位向來很少參預社會工作的人士，也出而參加，這是很可欣幸的事。我們期待社會進步，社會事業成就，我們很歡迎所有有資望有地位的社會公正人士都能積極參加社會工作，臨時救濟難民協會的成立是其開端。</p>
<p>其决，對於該會的今後工作，我們認爲最重要者就是敏捷與廉正。一遇災難發生。調查要敏捷，救濟要敏徢。　放要廉正，考核要廉正。一切的準備作，務必在事先考慮充分，佈置周到，以爭取時間，减少受難市民的痛苦爲第一義。我們相信在已經發表的主席團人選主持之下，必能如我們的澦期，不過，辦事人員的銓衡錄用，也須以上列範圍爲選擇標準，俾收上下一致，如指使臂之效。</p>
<p>最後，我們因此臨時救濟工作，聯想到目前本市慈書團體舉辦的經常救濟工作，也有適應環境的必要。譬如冬賑施粥，旣在食米感覺缺乏的現狀下，施粥就不一定以白米爲原斜，應盡量搭用雜糧，價值旣廉，施放範團即可擴大，同時，在量方面也應酌减，更能普遍範圍。共次，若干慈善團體，例如養老育嬰等類，不必要留在上海，爲節省開支，應擇鄕區疏散。這都是主持救濟作者值得考慮的一點。</p>

<p>物品配給處爲使市民明瞭各種物資配給之領證手續起見，頃特訂定市民領證須知十三條，即日起實行，原文如次：</p>
<p>（一）本處爲使市民明瞭領證手續起見，特訂定「市民領證須知」，分發市以資應用。（二）凡本市市民具有下列各項情形者，均得請領綜合配給證，一·原住於本市區域內者，二·由非本市區域內遷入者，三·出者。（三）凡本市市民請領配給證應由二房東或戶長或其代表，代表其家屬或其僱傭人等攜帶各項戶口證件，（例如一八兩區等處，應備市政總捐收據，保甲處月捐收據，南市閘北徐華坊浦東市中心等區，在市政總捐收據尚未普遍發給前，應向本處各發證所，請領配給物品請領證，連同該證及坊公所戶口證，或警察局戶籍證，必要時須呈騐市民證），按照捐票或請領證上所指定之領證日期，前往各該區所屬發證所領證，二房東或戶長等如有虛報人數，經本處查明屬實者，由本處院法辦。（四）凡市民由甲區遷入乙區時，應將保甲處所發移動證及用剩之配給證退回原處發證所，向該所領取移動報告證明書，在其背面後塡明退票張數及其數，交發證所將所退配給證加蓋「作廢」二字後，再交由原住所保甲長及二房東，在移動報告證明書背面上蓋章證明遷出，俟遷入新住所後，再請由新住所之保甲長及二房東，在增加配給證請求書正而上，蓋章證明後，方得將證件連同作廢配給證，向新住所所屬發給所換領，與所退同樣張數及期數之配給證。（例如卅一號至六十號綜合配給共計三十小張，市民陸續使用五小張，則剩者自卅六號至六十號，共計三十五小張，市民如以二十五小張掉換時，發證所應將同樣二十五小張換給市民）（五）凡市民回鄉應將用剩之配給證，連同各項居住證件，交白原發證所加蓋「回鄉」二字橡皮戳，仍由市民取回，以備於報銷戶口時，一併呈繳警察局保甲股備騐。（六）各區住戶如有人口由本市以外區域遷入本市者，或新生嬰孩者，均可由戶長或二房東或其代表携帶證件，向本處所屬各發證所領取增加配給證申請書，交由保甲長及二房東證明後，再將遷入證或出生證，一併呈繳發證所登記，呈准本處後核發之。（七）凡平民學校公立醫院敎會慈善機關，照章免除房捐者，須向財政局捐務處領取免捐證書，司閣及電梯司機人等，則由　主具函證明，得向各發證所領取非納稅人證書，依式塡明交由該區保甲長及其主管負責人蓋章證實後，方可申請發給配給證。（八）本市市民如有死亡者應於一星期內，連同戶口證件，由戶長或死者家屬將用剩之配給證退還原發證所請該所更正戶籍，並將所退配證加蓋「死亡」二字橡皮戳後，仍白市民領回，以備報銷戶口時，呈總警察局保甲股查騐。（九）市民領得配給蹬後，應妥爲保存，按照本處佈告規定之日期及配給物資名稱數量價格，將指定號碼之小張剪下，向指定另賣店購買之。（十）市民領得配給證後，如保藏不愼，致有燬損鼠咬滅失等情，不問故意或過失，本處不予補發或掉換。（十一）市民對於上開各條，如有疑問時，可於每日午後三時半，前往各發證所詢問。（十二）本處各發證所職員，於執行職務時，均有服務證章縣掛胸前，該證章上有顯明號碼可資區別，如懸某號證章之職員，對於市民有不正當行爲時，市民可記明號碼，向木處第三科告發。（第三科地點在江西路二〇九號六二四號室）（十三）本須知未盡事宜得隨時修正公佈之。</p>
<h3 id="c12">本次防空訓練　成績進步滿意　防火戰鬥精神欠佳 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>市民防空本部及消防處，頃分別發表「第十三次防空訓練評諭」及「防火消防」如下：</p>
<p>防空評論</p>
<p>（民國三十四年一月九日第十三次防空訓緡評論）（一）直接從事防空訓練人員之熱烈精神，及其操練成績之逐漸進步，至堪滿意，本部深爲欽佩，惟一般通行者之不協力態度，迄今依然未改，（二）此次不鳴防空警報汽笛，故警報傳達，未能澈底，以到交通管制成續欠佳，此爲不得已之結果，深望將來須澈底指導。（四）防空訓練中假設敵機來襲時，有若不利用防空壕等設備，而將身驅暴露於路上，務希將待避指導要領澈底熟習。（五）有若干民衆不知訓練警報發令，徬徨狼狽，手足無措，可謂對於防空極不關心。（六）此次劃定黃浦分局所轄全區舉行局地訓練，而袖手旁觀者人數之多，出於意外，殊爲遺憾。將來此種訓練辦法，尚擬繼續推行，務希市民積極協力，以構成總配置之陣容。（七）防空器材頗乏完備，殊屬遺憾，務須急速努力，促其完備。（八）防空壕之急速完成，目前誠屬燃眉之急務，市民應不必等待當局建設，先設備自用待避所，再建造公共防空壕。（九）在送電停止不吹放汽笛時，關於警報傳達之措置，尚須加意研究。（十）至於訓練預定之疑就指導階層、應需研究之處，尚屬不少。（十一）關於一設燈火管制狀况，除蘇州河以北地域之一部外，頗爲欠佳。在通常管制時，尚見多處露洩直射光綫，誠屬遺憾，車輛發火管制狀况，認爲尚有應待改善之處，今次燈火管制，成績欠佳，如單歸咎於不放汽雷，殊屬偏見。</p>
<p>此種現象，係表示市民對於防空漠不關心，並欠協力，可謂決戰下大上海全市民之恥辱。警察當局爲强化燈管取締起見，對於若輩人士，將嚴行舉發懲處。</p>
<p>防火消防</p>
<p>「防火消防」日本人之防火戰鬥精神頗旺，惟華人方面尚有欠佳之處，除戰鬥團體人員外，凡應爲家庭防火戰鬥員者頗多漠不關心之態度，洵屬遺憾。此雖因戰門計劃不澈底之故，然防空防火係戰鬥行爲，若戰鬥精神不飽滿，則必難戰勝，故此種精神必須旺盛。</p>
<p>此次防火消防技術，雖每次均見進步，然因該火戰鬥之準備，（如防火用水及其他資材等）不澈底之故，致頗有不切實際之憾，故至少在訓練計劃之塲所，須先行實施必要之戰鬥準備，俾可獲得相當效果，實屬緊要。</p>
<p>關於戰鬥員在戰鬥塲所之動作一層，頗有以手遞送水桶，以送水注水，作爲金科玉律者，須知炸彈落下後之所謂初期防火處置，端賴各人儘先送水注水，亦頗爲重要。</p>
<p>訓練須符合實際戰爭，故希望指導者於舉行訓練時，應按照該地區及建築物之狀况而計劃，俾得逼眞。有現示燒夷彈延燒銅骨水泥等不燃之建築物，而施行訓練者，殊屬不宜。</p>
<p>近代戰中之都市攻擊法，時時刻刻均在變化，昨日之燒夷彈已非今日之燒夾彈，故不宜拘泥陳舊之戰法，而將同樣之訓練反覆舉行。現示狀况時，並意料燒夷炸彈等或炸彈及燒夷彈同時擲落，而隨機應變，施行演練。又如落彈時立即延燒擴大等等情形，均應着想，而作進一步之訓練。</p>
<p>訓練決不可慢懈，此在消防工尤然。爲凖備第二次第三次空襲計，縱旣定之防空動作已經藏事，仍必須從事於水之補給及機材之檢點暨準備等等動作，現在僅視人員有無異狀，對於上項動作，殆猶未見實施，即行完事。故各人俱應考慮水之補給，施行訓練，傳得成爲習慣，是所厚望焉。</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3 id="c16">憑我們的信念 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>盼各界繼續努力捐款</p>
<p>無論做什麼事，必先有宗旨，有計劃，有目標，而後有信念；按步就班的做，事業纔有成功的希望。此次木報發動的「特別勸募」，論宗旨是救濟清寒失學，推行敎育救國的急務，誰也不能否認；故所定計劃與目標，都是切合實際需要，決非乏乏空論。而我們的信念，也非常堅定，相信全上海各界人士，必然執烈贊助，互相推動，而究成本報讀者的助學運動。當發動之初，認隊寥寥，捐款甚少，有許多人爲我們担憂，以爲際此時期，難達目的，然我們秉過去助學宗旨，堅定信念，逐漸推行，果然不出半月，社會人士，尤其各校師生，多方贊助，捐款成續，符合我們的預算。到今天爲止，已破一千萬元紀錄，差堪告　五千學子喁喁之望。惟時光迅速，轉瞬即將開學，希望熱心人士，綱續努力，及早達到預定的目標，庶幾上屆受助的五千學子，不致徬徨歧途，而遭失學的痛苦，國家民族，寶利賴之！</p>

<h3 id="c18">市府公物供應問題 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 顧自强</p>
<p>本市市府所屬各局處縣府區署，不下卅餘單位，各機關應用財產物品頗多，此項財產之購置，與物品之辦採，均係各機關就經常費或臨時費項下各自置辦。值此時際，不妥之處至多。在金錢上時間上均不經濟，甚至影響行政效能。亟有設置「市政府公物供應處」之必要。茲就「財產」與「物品」分述如次。</p>
<p>（一）關於公有財產　各局處等需用器具舟車器械及修繕材料興建工程等等財產，均係於需要時事先呈准辦理，再行呈送估價單編具槪算呈請撥款。程序繁多，耗費時日。每以物價上漲，致估價失效，購置困難。在市府方面考核審查消耗人力頗大。設立統一供應處後，估價調查手續，當可省免，興辦亦較便利。各機關之各項臨時費均可統籌辦理。</p>
<p>（二）關於公有物品　各　關之辦公應用物品如文具紙張筆墨簿籍雜品印刷各項，均係各單位各就經常辦公費項下核定數字支用。但因物價日漲，物品應用則不能因之免少，不得已各機關迭有呈請追加辦公用費之事。其最大原因爲辦公費用係每月按照預算範圍分別動支，不能大量購買，减少物價上漲之損失。今後市府如能設置供應處，則以各機關之辦公費集中爲供應處之資金，整批購辦各項文具紙張筆墨簿雜品印刷，按照事處上與員額上之實際需用情形，分發各機關領用。</p>
<p>我國郵政當局即有此項機構之設立，全國各郵政機關均係由一個機構供應。市府前曾設購置建築設計委員會，但以範圍較狹，組織亦不健全，致工作未見開展。尚希市府值茲改組之際，建立此項新機構，庶可减少市府財政支出及時間上不必要之浪費焉。</p>

<p>敎職員配給米，過去每月分爲三期配發，茲物配處規定自本月份起，改爲每月配發二期，戶口米雖已加價，當局爲優待敎職員計，仍維持每升五十元之原價，凡敎職員持有第九號票者，自十一日起至二十日止，可往指定之公賣處激款配領，數量爲一斗五升，較前已見加增，至敎職員第十號票，則於本月二十一日起至月底止配發。並聞凡司法警察持有丙種配米票者，亦與敎職員米同時發給，每張配量爲一斗八升五合。至甲乙兩種配票，俟當局確定配給日期後，即可正式公布。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Areas Along the Rennga Coast: Elite Japanese Troops Repel Enemy Forces; Air Force Transforms into Suicide Squadrons, Fighting with Human Bombs <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Philippine Front, 11th -- After the enemy forcibly landed on the Rennga coastal area on the morning of the 9th, they continued to gradually increase their forces in the area connecting San Fabian, Dagupan, and the coast of Rennga Bay, landing a considerable number of tanks. Conversely, elite Japanese ground troops are delaying and attacking the enemy, continuing their heroic fight with human bombs. The Japanese Air Force has also completely transformed into suicide squadrons, successively crashing into ships inside and outside the bay, forcing the arrogant enemy to suffer heavy casualties. Enemy warships or transport ships fully loaded with soldiers and supplies, etc., were struck by Japanese aircraft and mostly sunk, catching fire and burning, presenting a very miserable scene. Around 1:20 PM on the 10th, the enemy attempted to land 15 kilometers north of Rapu-Rapu and San Fabian. Japanese artillery in that area lured the enemy landing craft to the closest possible range and then opened fire all at once, inflicting heavy damage. At the same time, fifty soldiers completely drove the enemy back. Although the enemy warships and soldiers suffered heavy damage under the brave fighting of the Japanese army, the enemy's forces continued to gradually increase. As of the morning of the 10th, new ships visible to the naked eye within Rennga Bay numbered about 200 over 500 tons and 100 under 500 tons. However, due to the continuous attacks by Japanese aircraft in recent days, the firepower of the fleet and the bombing from aircraft on board has gradually weakened since the morning of the 10th.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, From a certain Japanese military base on the Philippine Front, 11th -- The enemy is eager to land on Luzon Island and is currently dispatching reinforcements. At present, with ten large military transport ships as the core, there is a second convoy of about 150 ships and a third convoy of 100 or 150 ships as follow-up forces. Based on the movements of these convoys, it is estimated that the enemy landing force numbers four to five divisions.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Embrace Mines to Shatter Enemy Tanks</p>
<p>Central News Agency, From a certain Japanese military base on the Rennga Bay Front, 10th -- The arrogant American troops are blindly landing towards the defense positions of the Japanese fortress on Luzon Island, aiming to invade Luzon Island. The enemy transport convoy anchored in Rennga Bay has been subjected to fierce attacks by Japanese Air Force suicide squadrons since the 6th, 7th, and 8th. On the morning of the 9th, under the cover of intense naval artillery and carrier-based aircraft, they forcibly began landing. Enemy gunboats then engaged in fierce artillery battles with Japanese ground troops. The enemy transport convoy, consisting of about 100 ships, formed two columns. Various landing craft, ranging from 4,000-ton to 2,000-3,000-ton vessels, approached the coast under the cover of destroyers. Japanese artillery fire exploded among the enemy ships. Enemy boats were seen hit about 50 meters from the shore, with many enemy soldiers falling into the sea. Japanese ground machine guns fired continuously. Enemy amphibious tanks began to disembark, but the front of large ships that had been hit continued to advance while firing, but many were destroyed by Japanese positions. Afterwards, the number of enemy soldiers landing under tank protection gradually increased. When enemy tanks drove into the area, Japanese soldiers hid by the roadside, embracing mines. When the enemy tanks approached, they rushed forward. Instantly, thick smoke spread, and iron fragments flew everywhere. A deep hole appeared in the ground, and both the enemy tank and the brave Japanese soldier were reduced to dust.</p>
<p>MacArthur Acknowledges Heavy Losses During Landing</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 11th -- According to MacArthur's headquarters, MacArthur personally went to the front line to direct operations. The American mobile units landing in Rennga Bay are the American Sixth Army under Krueger, covered by naval units of the Seventh Fleet under Kinkaid and air forces under the Australian Creagh. The Third Fleet under Halsey is also assisting in the operation. MacArthur's headquarters also announced on the morning of the 10th: Our forces, under the cover of naval and air forces, began landing on Luzon Island. Japanese air forces have repeatedly attacked our forces fiercely, and we have suffered considerable losses.</p>
<p>Three American Destroyers Sunk in the Pacific</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 11th -- Washington report: The U.S. Navy Department announced on the 10th that the American destroyers USS Hull, USS Monaghan, both 1,395 tons, and USS Spence, 2,200 tons, operating in the western Pacific, were all sunk by typhoons. In addition, four landing craft, one PT boat, one small submarine chaser, and one small auxiliary ship were sunk by the Japanese military. The crews of the USS Hull and USS Monaghan each consisted of 150 men, and the crew of the USS Spence consisted of about 220 men.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Saigon, 11th -- Since last year, Mr. Matsumoto, the Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, has been conducting sincere discussions with the leaders of the Vietnamese government in Hanoi. Having completed his mission, he returned to Saigon on the afternoon of the 9th. When meeting with a group of reporters, Ambassador Matsumoto described his impressions of his meeting with Governor-General Decoux as follows: Governor-General Decoux is determined to do his best within the possible scope between Japan and Vietnam, adhering firmly to the consistent policy. The Governor-General himself will be particularly careful during this critical situation to ensure no mistakes are made, and he will abolish the Supreme Council and establish the Vietnamese Advisory Council to gather public wisdom and follow public opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Enemy Convoy at Akyab Harbor Continuously Bombed; One Large Cruiser Sunk <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Burma Front Base, 11th -- Japanese air force units attacked the enemy transport convoy in the Akyab area on the 9th. On the 10th, they used new bomber squadrons to attack the wharf area of Akyab Harbor, causing seven fires, one of which was destroyed and another of which exploded. In addition, another unit attacked Ywahu, northwest of Mandalay, inflicting heavy bombing on the enemy forces there, causing a major fire. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base on the Burma Front, 11th -- In order to retake Burma, the enemy has been launching landings in the Akyab area from the Mayu Peninsula with ship-borne mobile units since the end of last year. However, the elite fighter squadron of the Burmese air force launched a fierce attack on the afternoon of the 9th, bravely diving and bombing amidst intense enemy anti-aircraft fire. Two large bombs hit one of their vanguard escort large cruisers, causing it to catch fire and sink, and heavily damaged two large transport ships (the sinking of one of them has been confirmed). One 300-ton boat was sunk, and three enemy four-engine fighter planes and small fighter planes flying nearby were shot down. Three Japanese aircraft did not return from this operation.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 11th -- The London Times newspaper discussed the Burmese battlefield on the 7th as follows: Up to now, the Japanese army can be said to be fighting with the greatest determination. Recently, the Japanese army may have a tendency to resist from Nankam to the Irrawaddy River, and from north of Shwebo to Mandalay, through this group of air bases to the port of Monywa on the Rangoon River. It is observed that the Japanese army may have the possibility of consolidating its position on this line and that fierce battles may break out in the area of the air base group in the Shwebo and Monywa corner.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Interview with Vice Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Industries: This Year's Key Production Increase Budget is Tripled Compared to Last Year <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th -- Increasing production is a prerequisite for improving people's livelihoods and enhancing combat capabilities. Therefore, the National Government has made this a key focus of its policies for several years, exerting all efforts to promote it. The actual results of production increases over the past three years and the promotion policies for this year are also of great concern to all parties. The Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Jiang Zuoxuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industries, who provided the following summary:</p>
<p>Last year, agricultural management focused on experimental work. The experimental results for rice, wheat, and coarse grains were satisfactory. Forestry and land reclamation and seedling cultivation focused on expanding the area. However, these tasks cannot be accomplished overnight and require years of accumulation to see results. As for this year's agricultural production increase promotion policy, the first is to simplify the implementation structure. In the past, there were numerous names for agricultural improvement areas, forestry and land reclamation demonstration farms, seedling cultivation farms, and cotton seed breeding farms, which resulted in the dispersion of manpower and funds, which was the biggest reason for not achieving the expected results. Therefore, this year, it was decided to adjust and merge them, especially in areas with a strong emphasis and poor security. Secondly, emphasis will be placed on promotion work, and the excellent varieties that have been successfully tested will be promoted as much as possible to achieve real production increases. In addition, this year's agricultural production increase funds have also been determined, which are about three times higher than last year.</p>
<p>Industrial Production Increase</p>
<p>Regarding industrial production increase work, the "Implementation Outline for Designated Production of Daily Necessities" has already been formulated and promulgated this year. This year, the implementation of the outline will continue to be emphasized to ensure that designated daily necessities manufacturers can produce according to the planned targets. Efforts will be made to allocate the raw materials and power needed by each factory reasonably. Mineral production increase is also a non-negligible task. At present, small mines in the Central China area are being actively developed. The Mantoushan Coal Mine recently added a new shaft. If it can be realized, this alone can increase coal production by more than 100 tons per day, which will make a great contribution to industrial coal and civilian fuel.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Increased Production in Japan and Germany: Excellent Aircraft <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 11th -- Colonel Kant, Director of the Technical Research Institute of the U.S. Army's Terhuel Aircraft Field, warned the public on the 9th that although the U.S. military has stepped up bombing of Japan, Japanese aircraft production is still increasing. Currently, both Japan and Germany are greatly increasing the production of excellent aircraft.</p>
<p>Capital Communications</p>
<h3 id="e7">Impressions of a Tea Party at the German Embassy <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— By Dan Ming, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper</p>
<p>In the new year of the Republic of China, Year 34 [1945], key figures in the National Government were busy preparing for new efforts. With the personnel reshuffle in the Shanghai Municipal Government, the capital instead seemed to sink into silence. Conversely, Germany, due to the renewed activity on the Western Front of the European war—Marshal Rundstedt's powerful counteroffensive on December 16th of last year revealing a new dawn of victory for the Axis powers—the German Embassy in China took advantage of the New Year festivities to host a grand tea party on January 3rd, inviting Chinese and foreign journalists to the capital. As the reporter happened to be stationed in the capital, I was naturally unwilling to miss such a meaningful international gathering.</p>
<p>The Residence Under the Swastika Flag</p>
<p>The Third Reich of Germany had, through its founding history, renewed the fate of Europe, and the situation in East Asia was also undergoing fierce changes. In the life-and-death struggle in which Asia and Europe shared a common goal, Germany's future course of action was, of course, a matter of utmost concern. Therefore, the journalists who attended the German Embassy's tea party today were very enthusiastic, almost making the Ninghai Road residence of Ambassador Welmann so crowded that one could barely breathe.</p>
<p>Walking into the magnificent living room, I saw a man wearing a Nazi major's uniform come out to greet me. It turned out to be Lai, who had recently arrived from Germany. One could see the spirit of a modern German soldier in him. Then, many other members of the German Embassy came forward. Worthy of note: one was an ally, Mr. Masami Kasagi, who was a secretary at the German Embassy; another was my compatriot, Mr. Wang Yuguang, who was the chief secretary of the German Embassy. Mr. Wang had served as a high-ranking official in the General Staff Headquarters during the Beijing government era and had also been an instructor at the Army University. His students and disciples had all become well-known military figures for a time. I heard that he went to Europe during the late Qing dynasty. I never expected to meet such a senior alumnus in the field of overseas study here.</p>
<p>Those who exchanged business cards with us included: Mr. Kordt, the German Chargé d'Affaires in China; Secretary Hördt; and Mr. Turlund, the manager of the Nanjing branch of the Transocean News Agency. Mr. Kordt studied in five European countries—Germany, Spain, Italy, England, and France—and attended six universities: Caen, Frankfurt, Barcelona, Rome, Paris, and London. Therefore, he was fluent in several languages. He later worked in the League of Nations and came to China two years ago. He is a young and promising diplomat. Mr. Turlund has been in China for a long time, having stayed in North China for an extended period. He also visited Chongqing between 1940 and 1941 and is a German journalist who is proficient in Chinese and familiar with Eastern affairs. Soon, Ambassador Welmann walked in, and Chinese and Japanese journalists also entered the room. The tea party then began.</p>
<p>Ambassador Welmann's Demeanor</p>
<p>Ambassador Welmann first gave a brief welcoming speech and introduced Deputy Military Attaché Lai to give a speech on the war situation. I heard that Mr. Welmann was over sixty years old, but his complexion was ruddy, indicating that he was a Nazi fighter full of vitality. He gave a precise report on the Rhine River front and the Hungarian front. Indeed, the stimulus given to the enemy on December 16th of last year was a turning point in the final stage of the decisive battle. During Mr. Lai's speech, he hung maps of the eastern and western fronts, showing the evolving dynamics of the war; he also distributed translated copies of the speech in Chinese and Japanese, so that even those of us who did not understand German could understand it at a glance.</p>
<p>Mr. Lai's speech lasted forty minutes, after which Ambassador Welmann gave a humble expression of thanks. In the midst of the enthusiastic crowd, he walked into the inner room for refreshments. The reporter was first introduced by Chargé d'Affaires Kordt to shake hands with Ambassador Welmann and offer my congratulations. In the conversation, I learned that Ambassador Welmann spoke fluent English. Later, I learned that he was one of Germany's foremost experts on England. According to Mr. Welmann, he came to China at the end of July 1943. Due to transportation difficulties, he traveled to Asia by submarine, landed in Malaysia, and then took a plane, passing through Saigon and Hainan Island to reach China. At that time, Mr. Welmann had served as the Director-General of the Political Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years and was an assistant to Ribbentrop. He knew that I was a reporter for the *Shen Bao* and was very pleased to talk with me, hoping that I would often visit him for friendly exchanges in the future.</p>
<p>Two Allied Officials</p>
<p>After the tea party, wine was served. The host wanted us to enjoy extremely valuable champagne and beer, accompanied by various sandwiches in the style of the famous Lu's Qingfang. At this moment, an allied official suddenly walked over and asked me, "Are you Mr. Dan Ming?" "President Chen has already told us about you, so I knew this was you!" Then, the allied official made some polite remarks.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I learned that the allied official was Mr. Matsuo, the Secretary of the Information Department of their embassy in China. He introduced me to Mr. An, the Director of the Information Department. Mr. An was not very tall, wore rimmed glasses, and was very robust. He looked somewhat like a Chinese and was a very fluent speaker. In addition, at this international tea party, I was able to meet many figures in China's propaganda circles, such as Mr. Fan Fugong and Ms. Li Gengsheng, who are both well-known and capable officials of the Propaganda Department. The guests and hosts talked until about six o'clock, when they departed with great pleasure. Upon leaving, I learned that Ambassador Welmann would be going to Shanghai tomorrow morning.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e8">Establishment of the Shanghai Temporary Refugee Relief Association <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Refugee Relief Association, which was organized by leaders from all walks of life in the city and public-spirited individuals, held its inaugural meeting the other day, passing its organizational charter and electing the presidium. The actual work, it is believed, will be actively launched soon.</p>
<p>The purpose and direction of the Association's organization are clearly stated in Article 2 of the organizational charter, which is to "handle relief for people in the Shanghai area who have encountered disasters." As Mr. Li Sihao, the initiator of the Association, said at the first preparatory meeting on December 12th of last year: "Relief work in this city is very much needed. There are two types of relief work, regular and temporary. Regular relief work is already being presided over by various charitable organizations separately. There is a great and urgent need to conduct temporary relief work." We can say more clearly that so-called temporary relief work is to adapt to the current wartime environment, where enemy aircraft may launch air raids and indiscriminate bombings at any time. Therefore, citizens who have encountered disasters should be rescued with compassion and mutual assistance. Under this goal, a strong organization is needed to take on the task of relief work. The Shanghai Temporary Refugee Relief Association was created for this task, and we cannot but place high hopes on it.</p>
<p>Now that the Association has been established, we have a few thoughts and opinions on this. We often say that social work should be the responsibility of social leaders to take on automatically. At the same time, while one may not be interested in political work and thus not enter officialdom, one cannot ignore social work and cannot stand idly by, because no one can live apart from society. If fair-minded people and respected leaders in society adopt a passive wait-and-see attitude, then social work will either stagnate or fall into the hands of improper people, thus creating an unstable and chaotic phenomenon in society. At this time, fair-minded people living in this society will also inevitably encounter the same unrest and will not be able to remain virtuous in isolation. On the other hand, when social work is led and carried out by fair-minded people, social undertakings are put on the right track, forming a force of righteousness. Not only will evil forces in society be unable to raise their heads, thereby stabilizing society, but it can also influence politics to enter the path of integrity and clarity. Only by actively participating in social work in this way can the original aspirations of fair-minded social leaders be realized. Otherwise, passively remaining virtuous in isolation is, in fact, impossible.</p>
<p>In the initiation and establishment of this Temporary Refugee Relief Association, Mr. Yan Huiqing's participation was the greatest force. Because of Mr. Yan's leadership, several other people who have rarely participated in social work in the past have also come forward to participate, which is a very gratifying thing. We look forward to social progress and the success of social undertakings. We welcome all fair-minded people of high standing and position in society to actively participate in social work. The establishment of the Temporary Refugee Relief Association is the beginning of this.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the future work of the Association, we believe that the most important things are agility and integrity. When a disaster occurs, investigation must be agile, and relief must be agile. Distribution must be honest and upright, and assessment must be honest and upright. All preparations must be fully considered in advance and arranged thoroughly in order to save time and reduce the suffering of the afflicted citizens as the highest priority. We believe that under the leadership of the elected presidium, it will be possible to meet our expectations. However, the selection and employment of staff must also use the above criteria as the selection standard, so as to achieve consistency from top to bottom, like the effect of an arm being used by a finger.</p>
<p>Finally, from this temporary relief work, we are reminded that the regular relief work conducted by charitable organizations in the city also needs to adapt to the environment. For example, during winter relief, when rice is felt to be scarce, porridge should not necessarily use white rice as the main ingredient. Coarse grains should be used as much as possible, so that the value is cheaper and the scope of distribution can be expanded. At the same time, the quantity should also be reduced appropriately to cover a wider range. Furthermore, some charitable organizations, such as those for the elderly and infants, do not need to stay in Shanghai. In order to save expenses, they should choose to evacuate to rural areas. These are all points worth considering for those in charge of relief work.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Germany Uses Jet Propulsion Engines on the Western Front <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – During the large-scale counteroffensive of German forces on the Western European front, hundreds of new fighter planes have frequently operated in front of the anti-Axis forces and shattered the strong positions of the American First Army. The elite among these fighter squadrons is the M.C.163 jet-propelled single-engine, single-seat fighter. These M.C.163 fighter planes and the M.C.163 twin-engine jet-propelled fighter planes appeared in small numbers over the French theater last autumn. It is rumored that their speed reached over 800 kilometers per hour, causing great trouble for the British and American air forces. The German Air Force authorities have not formally announced the structure and performance of the M.C.163 aircraft, only leaving it to enemy speculation and rumors.</p>
<p>German Forces in the Ardennes Shorten Their Lines</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German Frontline News: The German High Command, in view of the necessities of future operations, has decided to shorten the battle lines in the Ardennes salient and is now beginning to withdraw from the road transportation hub of Saint-Vith.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – German military sources told the German News Agency: The battles between the Meuse and Moselle rivers, especially on the northern wing of that area, were even more tense on the 9th. The pressure exerted by Marshal Montgomery's units on the northern front has slightly eased. On the western side of the penetration zone, the German High Command has ordered a shortening of the lines, and therefore, troops at the Saint-Vith road junction are withdrawing daily. Offensive operations by German forces on the Saar front and in Alsace continue to make smooth progress, but details have not yet been released.</p>

(3) When citizens of this city apply for allocation permits, the sub-landlord or head of household or their representative should bring various household registration documents (for example, in districts 18 and 2, receipts for municipal general donations should be prepared, and receipts for monthly donations from the Baojia offices. In the districts of Nanshi, Zhabei, Xuhua, Pudong, and the city center, before the municipal general donation receipts are universally issued, application for allocation permits should be obtained from the permit issuing offices of this office, along with the permit and the household registration certificate from the Fang Office, or the household registration certificate from the police station, and citizen certificates must be verified when necessary), and go to the permit issuing office to which their district belongs on the date specified on the donation ticket or application permit. If the sub-landlord or head of household falsely reports the number of people, if this office verifies the facts, this office will handle the case according to law. (4) When a citizen moves from District A to District B, they should return the move certificate issued by the Baojia office and the unused allocation permit to the original permit issuing office, and obtain a Move Report Certificate from that office. The number of returned tickets and their numbers should be clearly filled on the back, and the permit issuing office should stamp the returned allocation permit with the words "Canceled" before handing it over to the original residence's Baojia head and sub-landlord to stamp the back of the Move Report Certificate to prove the move out. After moving to the new residence, the Baojia head and sub-landlord of the new residence should stamp the front of the Increased Allocation Permit Request Form to prove it, and then the documents, together with the canceled allocation permit, can be exchanged for the same number and period of allocation permits as the ones returned to the new residence. (For example, if a comprehensive allocation permit with numbers 31 to 60 has a total of 30 small tickets, and the citizen has used 5 small tickets in succession, then the remaining tickets from numbers 36 to 60 are a total of 35 small tickets. If the citizen exchanges 25 small tickets, the permit issuing office should exchange the same 25 small tickets to the citizen.) (5) When a citizen returns to their hometown, they should hand over the unused allocation permit, together with various residence documents, to the original permit issuing office, which will stamp it with a "Return to Hometown" rubber stamp, and the citizen will take it back for presentation to the Baojia section of the police station for verification when canceling their household registration. (6) If the population of households in each district moves into this city from outside the city area, or if there are newborn babies, the head of household or sub-landlord or their representative can bring the documents to the permit issuing offices under this office to obtain an Increased Allocation Permit Application Form, hand it over to the Baojia head and sub-landlord for certification, and then submit the move-in certificate or birth certificate to the permit issuing office for registration, and it will be issued after approval by this office. (7) Civilian schools, public hospitals, church charity organizations that are exempt from house donation in accordance with regulations must obtain a donation exemption certificate from the donation office of the Finance Bureau. Staff and elevator operators, etc., can obtain a non-taxpayer certificate from each permit issuing office with a letter of proof from their employer. The form must be filled out and handed over to the Baojia head and its person in charge in that district for certification before an application for an allocation permit can be submitted. (8) If a citizen of this city dies, the head of household or the deceased's family should, within one week, return the unused allocation permit to the original permit issuing office, along with the household registration documents, and request that the office correct the household registration. The returned allocation permit will be stamped with a "Death" rubber stamp and returned to the citizen for presentation to the Baojia section of the General Police Bureau for verification when canceling the household registration. (9) After obtaining the allocation permit, citizens should keep it properly and cut off the designated number of small tickets according to the date, allocated material name, quantity, and price stipulated in the announcement of this office, and purchase them from the designated retail stores. (10) If a citizen obtains an allocation permit and it is damaged by fire, rats, or lost due to improper storage, whether intentional or negligent, this office will not reissue or exchange it. (11) If citizens have any questions about the above articles, they can go to each permit issuing office for inquiries after 3:30 pm every day. (12) Staff of each permit issuing office of this office will have a service badge with a clear number hanging in front of them when performing their duties to distinguish them. If the staff member wearing a certain number badge has improper behavior towards citizens, citizens can record the number and report it to the Third Section of this office. (The location of the Third Section is Room 624, No. 209 Jiangxi Road.) (13) Matters not covered in these instructions may be amended and announced at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Progress and Satisfaction with This Air Defense Training; Firefighting Spirit Unsatisfactory <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Citizen Air Defense Headquarters and the Fire Department have recently issued "Comments on the Thirteenth Air Defense Training" and "Fire Prevention and Firefighting," as follows:</p>
<p>Air Defense Comments</p>
<p>(Comments on the Thirteenth Air Defense Training on January 9, Year 34 of the Republic of China) (1) The enthusiasm of the personnel directly engaged in air defense training and the gradual progress of their exercises are very satisfactory. The headquarters deeply admires them. However, the uncooperative attitude of the general public has not changed to this day. (2) This time, the air defense siren was not sounded, so the alarm transmission was not thorough, and the traffic control results were not good. This was an unavoidable result, and it is hoped that thorough guidance will be given in the future. (4) During the air defense training, when enemy planes are assumed to be attacking, some people do not use air-raid shelters and other facilities, but expose their bodies on the road. It is hoped that the main points of shelter guidance will be thoroughly familiarized. (5) Some civilians do not know the alarm order for training, and they are at a loss and helpless. It can be said that they are extremely unconcerned about air defense. (6) It is a pity that the number of people who stood by and watched during the local training held in the entire area under the jurisdiction of the Huangpu Branch was unexpected. In the future, this training method will continue to be promoted, and it is hoped that citizens will actively cooperate to form a general configuration. (7) Air defense equipment is quite lacking, which is a pity. It is necessary to make rapid efforts to improve it. (8) The rapid completion of air-raid shelters is currently a matter of great urgency. Citizens should not wait for the authorities to build them, but should first equip self-use shelters and then build public air-raid shelters. (9) When electricity is stopped and the siren is not blown, the measures for alarm transmission still need to be studied carefully. (10) As for the guidance level of the training schedule, there are still many places that need to be studied. (11) The state of light control is quite poor, except for a part of the area north of the Suzhou River. During normal control, there are still many places where direct light is exposed, which is a pity. The state of vehicle ignition control is considered to be in need of improvement. This time, the results of light control are poor. It is a prejudice to attribute it solely to not releasing the siren.</p>
<p>This phenomenon indicates that citizens are indifferent to air defense and lack cooperation. It can be said that this is a disgrace to all citizens of Shanghai under the decisive battle. In order to strengthen the crackdown on light control violations, the police authorities will severely report and punish such people.</p>
<p>Fire Prevention and Firefighting</p>
<p>"Fire Prevention and Firefighting" Japanese people have a strong spirit of fire fighting, but the Chinese side still has shortcomings. In addition to the personnel of the fighting groups, many people who should be family fire fighters have a rather indifferent attitude, which is truly a pity. Although this is due to the incomplete battle plan, air defense and fire prevention are combat behaviors. If the fighting spirit is not full, it will be difficult to win. Therefore, this spirit must be strong.</p>
<p>Although fire prevention and firefighting technology has improved every time, due to the incomplete preparation for the fire fight (such as fire-fighting water and other materials), there is a regret of impracticality. Therefore, at least at the training site, it is necessary to first implement the necessary combat preparations so that a considerable effect can be obtained, which is very important.</p>
<p>Regarding the actions of fighters in the combat site, there are quite a few who take handing water buckets and pouring water as the golden rule. It must be known that the so-called initial fire prevention disposal after the bombing depends on each person sending water and pouring water as soon as possible, which is also very important.</p>
<p>Training must conform to actual warfare. Therefore, it is hoped that the instructors will plan according to the condition of the area and buildings when holding training so as to be realistic. It is not appropriate to train by showing incendiary bombs that spread to non-combustible buildings such as copper-bone cement.</p>
<p>Urban attack methods in modern warfare are changing all the time. Yesterday's incendiary bombs are not today's incendiary bombs, so it is not appropriate to stick to outdated tactics and repeatedly hold the same training. When showing the situation, anticipate incendiary bombs or bombs and incendiary bombs being dropped at the same time, and adapt to the situation to carry out exercises. Also, consider the situation where the fire spreads immediately after the bomb is dropped, and conduct further training.</p>
<p>Training must not be slack, especially for firefighters. In preparation for the second and third air raids, even if the established air defense actions have been completed, it is still necessary to engage in the replenishment of water, the inspection and preparation of machinery and equipment, and so on. At present, only the presence or absence of personnel is checked, and the above actions have not yet been implemented before completion. Therefore, everyone should consider the replenishment of water, carry out training, and make it a habit, which is highly anticipated.</p>

<p>The Sugar Professional Committee of the Commercial Unification Council, because all sugar allocation matters have been handled by the Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association since its establishment, the professional committee is no longer necessary to be set up. Therefore, it was ordered to end and abolish at the end of last month. All the files of the association's past control management have now been sorted out. The Commercial Unification Council sent personnel to receive them at 2:00 pm today. A part of the important sugar control case files was handed over to the Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association for management.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Price Limits Assessed for Seventy Kinds of Soap <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Price Assessment Council assessed the recent price limits for 70 kinds of soap yesterday. For example, the retail price of Mingxing Riyue soap is 127.2 yuan per bar, hard soap is 113.1 yuan, Mingxing Superior soap is 114.8 yuan, Yuhua Silver Star soap is 122.2 yuan, Arrow Knife soap is 122.2 yuan, Guben soap is 123.8 yuan, Nanyang Superior soap is 123.8 yuan, Henry Yellow A-character soap is 121 yuan, Daxin Bull Brand soap is 121 yuan, etc. The above price limits are based on a weight of 405 city catties per box, a price of 13,500 yuan, and a standard of 50% fatty acid content. The quality of soaps with lower quality is reduced and assessed in direct proportion to the fatty acid content and weight.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Relying on Our Beliefs <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Hope all sectors continue to work hard to donate funds</p>
<p>No matter what you do, you must first have a purpose, a plan, a goal, and then have a belief; by doing it step by step, the career has the hope of success. The "Special Fundraising" launched by this newspaper is aimed at relieving the poor and out-of-school and promoting the urgent task of education to save the country, which no one can deny. Therefore, the plans and goals set are all in line with actual needs, and are by no means empty talk. And our belief is also very firm, believing that all sectors of Shanghai will definitely give enthusiastic support and promote each other, and eventually become a scholarship movement for readers of this newspaper. At the beginning of the launch, the number of teams was small and the donations were small. Many people were worried about us, thinking that it would be difficult to achieve the goal at this time, but we adhered to the past scholarship purpose, strengthened our beliefs, and gradually promoted it. Sure enough, in less than half a month, people from all walks of life, especially teachers and students from various schools, gave various support, and the results of donations met our budget. As of today, it has broken the 10 million yuan record, which can be told to the eager hope of 5,000 students. However, time is passing quickly, and school is about to start in a blink of an eye. I hope that enthusiastic people will continue to work hard and reach the predetermined goal as soon as possible, so that the 5,000 students who received assistance in the previous session will not wander off course and suffer the pain of dropping out of school, and the country and nation will rely on it!</p>
<p>The charity sale for scholarship is deeply appreciated</p>
<p>Jinling Road Yuanyuan Society and others wrote: "Directly to the opener, our colleagues donated 50,000 yuan to your newspaper's scholarship fund yesterday to celebrate the health of Master Ruoyu Xuan, and received a bottle of 'Deeply Appreciated' tonic. The colleagues were even more excited because your newspaper handles scholarships and needs urgent funds. Therefore, we held a charity sale of this precious tonic again, raising 51,000 yuan on the spot, named 'Ruoyu Health Second Team'. At the same time, Master Xuan also recognized a team at the same amount, named 'Ruoyu Health Third Team', totaling 102,000 national currency. Here is a special presentation, hoping to accept it."</p>
<p>Zhengxing Girls' Middle School enthusiastically helps students</p>
<p>Zhengxing Girls' Middle School wrote: "Respectfully opener, this time our school hosted the Zhengxing Cup First All-Shanghai Women's Individual Table Tennis Championship, with more than 30 participants. After group elimination rounds, six group champions were produced. After round-robin playoffs, Lin Jin and Zhou Rui won the final. The finals were held at 2:00 pm on the 7th of this month in the former Xiqing ball room. There was also a men's table tennis friendly match on that day, inviting He Ren to fight against Shanghai United. The performance was wonderful and caused a sensation in Shanghai. In order to respond to your newspaper's scholarship fund movement, all spectators entered the venue with tickets. Donors to the scholarship fund were given an entrance ticket. The total donation revenue was 150,000 yuan. In addition to the venue fee (10,000 yuan), all expenses were borne by our school. All donations were equally distributed to your newspaper and the News Scholarship Fund. Here is a presentation of 70,000 yuan of national currency, named 'Zhengxing Girls' Middle School Second Team, Third Team, Fourth Team, (Zhengxing Cup Finals Donation Revenue)'. I hope to accept it and ask to announce it for credibility. If people from all walks of life hear the wind and rise up, work together to expand the scholarship fund, it will be very fortunate."</p>

<h3 id="e18">Municipal Government Public Supplies Problem <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Ziqiang</p>
<p>The various bureaus, offices, county governments, and district offices affiliated with the municipal government number no less than thirty, and these agencies require a considerable amount of property and goods. The purchase of this property and the procurement of these goods are currently handled individually by each agency, drawing from their respective operating or temporary budgets. At this juncture, this arrangement is rife with problems. It is uneconomical in terms of both money and time, and it even affects administrative efficiency. There is an urgent need to establish a "Municipal Government Public Supplies Office." The following discussion is divided into "Property" and "Goods."</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Public Property: Bureaus and offices require equipment, vehicles, machinery, repair materials, construction projects, and other property. These are currently handled by first obtaining approval when needed, then submitting price quotations and preparing a budget to request funds. The procedures are numerous and time-consuming. Price increases often render the quotations invalid, making purchases difficult. On the municipal government's side, assessment and review consume significant manpower. Establishing a unified supply office could eliminate the quotation and investigation procedures, making construction more convenient. All temporary expenses of various agencies could be centrally managed.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Public Goods: Office supplies used by the agencies, such as stationery, paper, pens, ink, notebooks, sundries, and printing, are currently funded from each unit's operating budget according to approved amounts. However, due to rising prices, the need for goods cannot be reduced accordingly. As a result, various agencies have repeatedly requested additional office expenses. The biggest reason is that office expenses are disbursed monthly according to the budget, preventing large-scale purchases to mitigate losses from rising prices. If the municipal government establishes a supply office in the future, the office expenses of each agency could be pooled as the supply office's capital. It could then purchase stationery, paper, pens, ink, notebooks, sundries, and printing in bulk, and distribute them to each agency according to their actual needs in terms of personnel and operations.</p>
<p>The Chinese postal authorities already have such an organization in place, with all postal agencies nationwide supplied by a single entity. The municipal government previously established a Purchasing and Architectural Design Committee, but its scope was too narrow, and its organization was not sound, leading to a lack of progress. It is hoped that the municipal government, during this restructuring, will establish this new organization to reduce unnecessary waste of municipal government finances and time.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Special Rice Allocation for Teachers and Staff: Increased Ration <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The rice ration for teachers and staff, previously distributed in three installments per month, has been changed by the Materials Distribution Office to two installments per month, starting this month. Although the price of household rice has increased, the authorities, to favor teachers and staff, will maintain the original price of 50 yuan per liter. Teachers and staff holding ticket number 9 can redeem their rice at designated public sales offices from the 11th to the 20th, with a quantity of 1.5 dou (approximately 15 liters), an increase compared to before. Ticket number 10 will be distributed from the 21st to the end of the month. It is also reported that judicial police holding Category C rice ration tickets will receive their rice at the same time as teachers and staff, with each ticket entitling them to 1.85 dou (approximately 18.5 liters). The dates for the distribution of Category A and B tickets will be officially announced once the authorities have finalized them.</p>
