<h3>琉球羣島方面敵艦船　被擊沉毀五十艘　航空及水上部隊猛攻戰果</h3>
<p>日大本營發表</p>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日大本營三十一日下午四時三十分發表琉球羣島方面戰况如次：　敵機動部隊艦上機之來襲，自三月三十日以來，雖形中止，但依然對冲繩本島實施艦砲熾烈之射擊。　日航空部隊及水上部隊攻擊敵艦船，所獲戰果業經判明者，計擊沉航空母艦二艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦四艘，驅逐艦六艘，輸送船一艘，艦種不詳十六艘。擊毀戰艦一艘，戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦五艘，輸送船一艘，艦種不詳十一艘。</p>
<p>中部太平洋三十一日中央社電　冲繩島海城之敵機動部隊，更續極由後方增强兵力，幷以戰艦十數艘及巡洋艦，驅逐艦接近冲繩島，三十日仍於於冲繩本島附近游弋。三十一日晨，含有戰艦數艘之一部敵軍，巳按近久米島。又三十日西南方面一帶雖濃霧覆蔽，然敵仍以艦載機三百架向各地來襲，日方遂與之展開激戰，至三十日黎明，日魚雷艇轟沉敵巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘，此外幷擊沉敵潛艇一艘。</p>
<h3>冲繩島日軍民　枕戈待命中　準備展開一大殺戮戰</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　迫近沖繩要塞之敵軍，舉其主力，發動攻擊，日軍為防衛祖國，莫不奮勇爭先，由於航空部隊及水上部隊之殊死戰，巳將敵空母二艘及其他敵之艦船五十艘擊沉，並擊毀戰艦等三十九艘而令其無數之生命與龐大之物量毀於一旦。在此輝皇戰果下，士氣更表激勵，茲日航空部隊更繼續勇躍出擊，而對目前尚於沖繩本島附近游　，且正對該島南部實施熾烈集中砲擊中之敵艦船羣，予以不假瞬息餘暇之攻擊，刻正擴大戰果中。即以迄今所獲之戰果言之，亦堪與於雷伊泰灣頭邀擊敵侵攻軍之菲律賓海面海戰及裂伊泰灣海戰之七日間之綜合戰果相匹敵，預料質及俱優之敵於此流血後，將以極愼重態度應戰矣。又敵之後續艦艇，於冲繩附近被擊沉後，仍續行不斷增援，然此不過爲日軍之餌耳，故未來之戰果，將更擴大。又冲繩本島之日陸上部隊，亦在激昂壯烈之情緒下，枕戈待命中。</p>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電敵美企圖侵犯琉球羣島，故出動太平洋艦隊陸續佔據琉球羣島各島，就中對冲繩島之攻擊尤爲猛烈，頗有即行登陸之可能。同時敵更恃其龐大之戰力，直接猛攻各島，其機動部隊復接近九州地區目下依然游弋於日本近海，其目的似在切斷日方對琉球羣島戰綫之接濟。敵砲艦對冲繩本島轟擊逐日熾烈，迄二十七日止，平均每日爲五百護，至二十八日增至二千發，二十九日計達七千發。敵艦隊於沖繩本島，周圍之作戰行動，與琉黃島登陸前之情形相似，又其小船團亦隨艦艇羣接近冲繩本島，由此可斷定敵欲奪取該島之作戰日期愈益接近，日航空部隊之水上部隊與特別攻擊隊，連日對敵艦船繼續作必死必殺之攻擊，收獲相當戰果。又冲繩本島之地上部隊以及官民，均在積極準備，藉期敵軍踏進該島之際，立即展開以一殺十之大殺戮戰。</p>
<h3>B29型敵機　空襲名古屋　並侵昭南週邊</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之B29型機約五十架，三十日夜九時半起，約歷一小時半，以王力來襲名古屋，餘者曾製廣島及吳方面。</p>
<p>昭南三十一日中央社電　敵B29型機約二十架，二十九日晨一時許，侵攻昭南週邊，三時三十分退去。三十日晨二時五分許，復有B29型機三十餘架來製昭南週邊，投彈後，至四時三十分許始退去，日方損害輕微。</p>
<h3>日南總裁　任勅選議員</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日政府特奏荐大日本政治會總裁南次郎大將爲貴族院勅選議員，三十一日業已發表，午後四時，由小磯首相將勅令轉達雨氏。</p>
<h3>日大東亞省改革機構</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日大東亞省三十一日發表稱：茲爲謀行政之簡素化，特改革組織機構，除官房外，將原有之二十二課一室縮成至五局十六課，如斯，當可謀行政力量之集中以及效率之增强，同時幷裁員三分之一，而於少數精說之主義下，力謀政策之圓滑運營。</p>
<h3>建部對郵工　謀安定生活　嚴禁非法需素</h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　邇來上海等各地郵局信差，於投遞信件時，公然向收信人非常需索，記者爲此特往訪建設部，據云，部方已明令主管郵局嚴予查禁，同時更派員往滬，刻郵電司長　愈亦正在滬與關係方面研究調查，謀取有效之取締措置，部方亦擬就可能範團內，盡力謀各郵工之生活安定，俾收標本並治之效。</p>
<h3>新任贛省長定今日接篆</h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　新任江西省長兼駐九江綏靖王任黃自强，十日下午五時許由京飛尋，定四月一日接篆視事。</p>
<h3>日海軍省發表立功勇士名單</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日海軍省發表稱，夏威夷海戰開始以來，在各戰綫指揮轟炸機隊作戰，建立偉功，去年六月在馬里亞納方面，担任偵察敵軍任務而壯烈戰死之海軍少佐千早猛彥以下各勇士，急襲塞班之第一衝植特攻隊，菲島第二神風特攻隊以及防衛國土，擊落B29型機之偵察員西尾修上等十九名勇土，其偉勳前已分別授予感狀或布吿全軍，此次對士官及第二神風隊二勇士晋升二級，其他下士官兵亦予以特別任用。</p>
<h3>將校團員畢業禮　陳兼團長致訓　注意修養語多勗勉</h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　中央陸軍將校訓練團將校隊第七期學員二十名，業已受訓期滿，于三十一日上午九時舉行畢業典禮，陳兼團畏特親臨致訓，其大意如次：</p>
<p>本人感到一般國人無論是靑年或是軍人，都缺乏修養，所謂修養，就是對於自已的學問須要不間斷的加以研究，對於自己的行爲，不斷的加以檢討。修養並不是一件困難的問題，自已知道要做的去不斷的研究，便能養成習慣，應該做的事沒有去做，心裏就覺得不安，不應該做的事偏要去做，良心上要受到資罰。一般人因傳統而養成壞的習慣，因此自身立身行事的進途發生障碍，並且對於國族亦有莫大的影響，這就是修養不好的原因所致。</p>
<p>恪守紀律知行合一</p>
<p>守紀律就是習慣，下級幹部養成好的習慣，並不一定要上官的督促，守紀律是應當的修養，亦說是素養，就是傳統下來的習慣。王陽明先生說：知而不行，不可謂之知，知行必須合一，是修養的最大目標，同時還要言行一致。我們說出了口，必須實行，做不到的不如不說，現在有許多靑年，不是太放肆，就是太頹廢，沒有一些修養。從前我們在學生時代，尙未入軍校以前，見到一般軍閥很覺痛恨，看到報紙上的輿論，部非常痛快，同時見到好多同志入了軍校以後，也漸漸地走到軍閥的路上去，這是什麼緣故呢？就是因爲修養的不够。</p>
<p>現階段的中國困難很多，一般的人只顧自己解決困難，不管別人的幸福，只顧自己方便，不管他人的方便，這就是缺少修獲，結果養成了壞的習慣，已成爲一種通病。所謂有學間，有修養，是不要給人家困難，不能因自己圖方便而去犧牲他人的方便，這樣才能成一個十全的人，軍隊才成爲一個美滿的軍隊。</p>
<p>名將言行可資模範</p>
<p>希望各人返防以後，要把歷史上的名將舉止言行來做參攷，他們如何去指揮部下，如何爲國爲民謀造福祉，因爲學問就是經騐，這是累積成功的結論，我們自已當然不够，還要以歷史上名人的舉止及名將的言行，作爲自已言行的帮助，這是最切要的。其次在交友方面亦應注意，從朋友處也可以得到不少的助益，但是要交益友，今天我不以長官來說話，乃是以前輩的經騐吿訴大家，作為臨別的贈言。</p>
<h3>柏林婦孺奉令疏散</h3>
<p>柏林三十一日中央社電　德國社黨福利機關，鑒於反軸心軍對柏林轟炸益趨激烈，三十日特發布吿，防衛要員以外之婦孺疏散於他方，然不强制。</p>
<h3>勞合喬治安葬追封伯爵</h3>

<h3>戰時民衆代表會議旁聽記</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>三月二十八日，一個睛朗的早晨，國府路的國民大會堂，門首高懸着「各省市戰時民衆代表會議」字樣。會塲在二樓，佈置整潔，壁問遍懸大幅標語，其中最引人注意者，爲「說老實話責任」及「開放言論暢達民意」兩條。</p>
<p>代表羣像</p>
<p>今番參加大會的，有十八單位，出席代表人數有四十九人，其戰業有敎授，醫師，商人，有白髮蒼蒼的老者，有年富力强的靑年。服裝有長袍馬掛，有西服，其中北來代表之「新民裝」，最爲別緻。因代表來自不同之省市，故其方言亦異。開會討論時，主席頗感應付困難。</p>
<p>會塲情緒</p>
<p>大會第二日，討論戰案時，情形熱烈，發言者爭先恐後，每因一字之微，辯論多時，尤以天津市代表潘駿千趙松坡兩氏之慷慨陳辭，見解獨到，博得　聲不少，堪爲大會生色。</p>
<p>緊張一幕</p>
<p>大會第二日午後四時，正當天津市代表潘駿午陳述津市煙毒為害情形時，警報之聲大作，有敵機十架出現空際，機聲軋軋，與轟轟之高射砲聲相應，爲安全計，主席提議暫行停會，然爲時僅五分鐘，敵機少遠，各代表即返會塲繼續討論，不意再過數分鐘，敵機又來，飛行甚低，掠會塲屋頂而過，濫以機槍掃射，致附近死傷市民十六名。當時在塲代表不顧危險，於警報未解除前，返塲繼續開會，其愛國眞誠，至是欽佩。</p>
<p>提案一班</p>
<p>大會提案有二十四件，內容不外國計，民生兩項，各案除類似者合併外，正式通過者爲十四案。國計類中重要者有北平市代表徐冽，徐光達氏提出之「請政府保障人民言論集會自由，採納民意，並確立民意機關案」，「展開統一救國運動，以期繼承國父遺志，完成革命」與「統一全國行政制度，早日完成全國獨立統一」等案。關於民生者，除「鞏同地方治安以救民命」，與「平抑食糧價格便利物資運輸，以維國民生計」緖案外，最引人注意者，莫若天津市代表提出之「澈底强化全國拒毒運動，並請政府勵行禁毒政策案」，該代表痛陳毒品爲害，語至警惕，謂華北天津市有烟民十三萬餘；佔全市人口十分之一，有烟館二百餘家，甚至有年未及二十歲者，亦染有烟癖。天津鬧市「梨棧」，木將開設五十家烟館，經該市拒靑會與熱心人士反對，其事始　。現該市創有「天津國民拒毒會戒烟醫院」，採用友邦正山博士發明之戒烟藥「東光劑」，能於四十二小時內將烟癮戒絕，屢試不爽，治愈烟民至衆，所惜原發明人對該藥處方保守秘密，故不能大量倣製，救全國烟民於苦海耳。</p>
<h3>新幾內亞島北岸日軍乘月夜進襲完全佔領桑沙波爾敵軍陣地</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地三十一日中央社電　新幾內亞北岸地區之日軍，乘二月二十日之月夜，進擊桑沙波爾之敵軍陣地，將其完全佔領。該地在去年三月二一十日敵軍以多數機動部隊在此登陸，復於飛行塲及陣地之四周布設聰音器，俾資警戒日軍接近。去歲十二月，日軍於摧毀敵軍陣地後，乘二月二十日月夜，猛攻桑沙波爾，且速日轟炸，同時發動驅逐艦，掃海艇等陸·海兵力竭力抵抗，然悉遭日軍擊退，而退至馬爾地區。按桑沙彼爾敵軍爲掩護馬爾機塲而堅守之前衝基地，日軍將之佔領後，可確保西部新幾內亞北岸據點，且馬爾機塲於軍事上之含義甚大。</p>
<h3>反軸心軍企圖　包圍魯爾區　德軍正採取有效對策</h3>
<p>柏林三十一日中央社電　海通社訊：蒙高茂萊包團魯爾區之用心益趨明顯，英第二軍向北及向東之壓力，較之向西南魯爾工業區之壓力尤見增重。反軸心軍越格拉貝克後，殊少進展，惟其北之先鋒則已經斯達特隆恩·杜爾曼，向孟斯達推動至於南路之先鋒則自瑪爾堡向北及東北推動，此南北二路先鋒如能在孟斯達·巴達龐及凱塞爾一帶會師，則魯爾工業區即將完全陷入包圍。現該兩先鋒間之直綫距離，猶有百餘公里，德軍當局自當奮力，不使敵方完成此計，現敵軍仍繼續攻擊萊因。魯爾·西格河間之德軍扼阻陣地，而杜塞爾道夫與里比庫森間亦再有敵人企圖渡河，以圖正面進攻魯爾工業區。</p>
<h3>舊金山會議中投票權問題</h3>
<p>里斯本三十一日中央社電　據華盛頓電：日宮於二十九晶發表：蘇聯代表於雅爾達會談時，曾要求承認白俄及鳥克蘭兩共和國之投票權，因此，蘇聯可於總會內獲得三票之投票權，美國代表亦以確保三票之投票權為條件。據倫敦電：英國於會議中，雖承認蘇聯之三票，但對美國之三票幷未承認，其對美政府之發表至為驚愕。</p>

<h3>中國的本位建設</h3>
<p>— 汪向榮</p>
<p>最近半年以來，全面和平的空氣非常濃厚，而民衆方面對於全面和平之期望，亦日切一日，可是到現在爲止，我們還沒有能找出絲毫曙光；不但這樣，而且重慶方面更在英美的支持之下，向中國大陸實行總反攻了，在這情形之下，全面和平的實現是不是還有可能呢？在我們看來，全面和平的實現，是絕對的可能的，因為其實現並不是某一部份的希望，而是歷史上必然的要求，換一句話說，中日事變的發生，是有其歷史的必然性的，而中日事變的結束，也是有其歷史的必然性的，中日的問題，我們相信一定是要得到一個全面的解決的，可是爲什麼到今天還是亳無頭緒呢？在我們看來，認爲是中國方面並沒有能具備應付這歷史上必然性的條件所致，所謂這種應付的條件，就是中國本位化之選沒有能完成，本位觀之沒有樹立所致。</p>
<p>誰都知道中日問題必須得一個全面的解決，也是誰都知道中日問題之解決是政治而不是軍事，可是誰都不能平心靜氣的來檢討中日問題，我們看這數年來，和平區中的言論，大多數是說一些日本人所愛聽的話；而抗戰區方面呢？又專門攻擊日本，這二種態度，在我們看來都覺得是抹殺了事實，歪曲了專實，他們都沒有能站在中國人的立場而說話！立論而僅僅以感情出發所致。這一種以感情爲出發而檢討中日問題，處理中日問題，在我們看來，實在是中日二國前途最大的危機，可是不幸得很，今日的中國正充滿了這種高調。</p>
<p>事變以來，八年之中，日本方面無論是政府民間，都能順着時勢，而適當地改變其政策，這種政策的改變在我們看來，是日本本身的一種反省。日本爲什麼要有這樣不斷的反省呢？因爲世界的情勢是不斷的在變化的，在道環境中生存的國家，也不能不隨之而變，可是我們國家呢？除了可以聽到一些高調以外，我們還可以得到一個原則，就是以不變應萬變，這種態度，在我們靑年人看來是非常的失望的，我們認爲在檢討中日間題之全面解決的時候也好，在謀戰後中國之復興建設也好，在今天，我們中國人之問，就必須要有一個普遍的，澈底的反省運動不可，這個反省運動，在我們看來，　是中國木位的建設。</p>
<p>我們相信，在檢討中日問題之全面解決時，我們必須有一個基本觀念，就是中國是一個需要獨立生存的國家，而日本也是一個需要獨立生存的國家。在討論中國戰後復興建設的時候，我們也有一個基本觀念，就是中國必須是一個獨立自主的國家，才能談復興和建設。這一個基本觀念，就是中國本位觀的樹立和中國本位建設的完成。</p>
<p>在十年前，樊仲雲先生等十大敎授，曾經對當時的文化發出過中國本位文化建設的宣言，主張不全盤西化，也不全盤東化，來挽救五四以後中國文化所這受到的厄運。當時他們所這遇到的局勢，還沒有今日這樣的艱困，也沒有今日這樣的複雜。所以他們只着眼於文化方面。可是在今日這情形之下，我們却認爲中國本位的建設，巳決不是僅僅適用於文化這一方面了，而且也普遍的適用在政治，經濟，軍事各方面，所以我們敢以我們少數人的力量，來提出這一個建設中國本位的口號。中國本位建設這是一個很空的口號，究竟要怎樣才能完成中國本位的建設，才能使中國本位觀能樹立呢？我們對於政治，雖然都是門外漢，但也極願意比較具體的指出。</p>
<p>我們認爲在今日情形之下，非實行全面的革新不可，以政治上的革新來强化國民政府，來樹立談判和平的基本力量，呌經濟上的革新來安定民生，培養國力。呌軍事上的革新來保衛國家，協助作戰。呌文化上的革新來確立新倫理觀。再具體一點的說，在政治上我們必須指出，中華民國是統一的，不分東南西北的，換句話說，中華民國必須是一個統一的中華民國。我們更認爲必須要以人才爲主，開放一黨專政，同時對於民衆的合法自由應予保障，外交方面更應本中國人的立塲來與各友邦共謀建設。在經濟上應該樹立澈底的國家資本主義，建設重工業的中國，以國家資本之統制來消滅一切勢資的糾紛。在軍事上，我們主張集中軍權，反對軍閥地方割據。在文化上，我們希望以固有之文化爲基礎，而吸收，消化外來的文化使之融合而成一種新文化，我們認爲中華民族的前途，中華民國國家的復興是決不能放任少數人去玩弄。我們決不想革命，也沒有政治上的野望，可是我們是中華民族的一份子，我們所以這樣的要求全面革新。</p>
<p>七十年以前，中國和日本共謀革新，可是在七十年以後日本成了世界上一大强國，而中國却轉弱不堪，這最大的原因，就是日本人能在其本位而談革新。可是我們中國方面則處處想依賴他人，依靠他人。所以七十年以後，我們所能見到的結果也有天壤之別的，日本的明治維新造成了一個近代四大强國之一的日本，可是我們戊戌政變和革命的結果卻加深了我們次殖民地的地位，這樣歷史上的教訓。使我們到今天不能不再奮起了。同時我們周圍的情勢也不允許我們再欺人騙人了。所以在這時候，我們以少數靑年人的力量來提出這　個　號。</p>
<p>我們要求所有的中國人都站到中國的本位上去，來在為中國謀自主獨立這一條件之下而努立，我們很知道，中國本位觀之確立，中國本位建設之完成是有待於盟邦之協助的，但是俗語有一名說：「天助自助者」。所以我們認為在這一個運動的過程中，最主要的還是得有待於具有國家觀念的中國人，以中國人的本位鬥爭來博取盟邦的協助的。我們反對一切依存外力的思想，我們認為只要我們自己能把握現實，認淸將來而不斷努力的話，我們的前途是光明的，反之，就是盟邦如何的協助，也是徒然的！</p>
<p>時間已經不允許我們再推三阻四，自欺欺人了，日本國內已經開始了國民總武裝的動員們民族的命運了，我們並不要求革命，但是我們是中華民族一份子，所以我們要求我們的同胞能自覺，能反省。而我們的政府更能以全面的革新來完成中國本位的建設，以我們自身的努力來足進全面和平的實現，中日問題之全面解決。</p>
<h3>民衆代表大會宣言　（續完）</h3>
<p>解除民生痛苦</p>
<p>要求經濟上合理措施，解決民生痛苦。國父在民生主義中平均地權與節制資本，其目的一方在保護國家民族資本，以抵抗殖民地主義的經濟侵略，同時又限制私人資本之膨脹，免再走上歐美資本主義之岐途，目前民生困苦已至極點，若不從速設法救濟，四萬萬同胞將無瞧類，而考其原因，戰爭實爲厲階，因戰爭影響而致生產不足，運輸不便，原料缺乏，消耗增加，而物價飛騰，幣值日跌，地主惡化腐化勢力重重剝削，貪官污吏坐地分肥，均為促成今日民生痛苦之因素，吾人在各地所切身飽嘗，所遭所遇旣深且切，深盼政府設法對症施藥，講求經濟上之合理措施，能解除一分痛苦，便解除一分，能有一步辦法，便實行一步，如壓抑食糧價格，疏通物資來源，改善物資統制制度，强化工商組織，整肅商業道德，及振興輕工業等辦法，均盼政府設法，早日見諸實施，而民衆亦應儘量節約消費，增加生產，與政府相協力。</p>
<p>國民武裝自衛</p>
<p>鞏固治安，完成國民武裝自衛組織。國父遺敎中，對共產主義始終認爲國家社會禍亂之源，故國父在民生主義演講，特別指出馬克斯共產主義之錯誤，國父容共之本意，乃企岡共黨放棄其組織與主義，加入國民黨，奉行三民主義，在於國父與越飛共同宣言中，彰彰可放，乃共黨背信棄義，欲奪取國民革命之領導權，於是國民黨決心淸共，更進而圍剿之，迄事變發生，共匪藉抗戰救國名義，數年以來赤焰陡張，過處如蝗，今後必須鞏固地方治安，使民衆安居樂業，並普遍實施軍事訓練，究成全國國民地方武裝自衛組織。</p>
<p>希望見諸實施</p>
<p>以上六端，深信爲目前救濟時艱之要圖，如能一一見諸實行，則其他社會敎育文化諸端之改進，亦可按步實施，謹請國府早日分別付之實施，藉慰衆望，更盼內地同胞與吾人團結一致，繼續汪故主席生前領導之和平反共建國運動，實現二十年來國父逝世以後未竟之遺志，在陳代主席領導之下，完成三民主義新中國之建設，謹此宣言。</p>

<h3>特別法庭滬分庭　今日正式成立　蔡庭長談今後處理方針</h3>
<p>國民政府爲憨治貪官汚吏，消滅不法商民，減縮訴訟程序，力謀辦案迅速起見，特於去年三月在首都成立特別法庭，本市方面，亦經第六六次最高　防會　決定設　分庭，特派前江蘇商等檢察長察日新爲庭長，趙鉦鏜。高難渠爲審判官。蔡庭長自奉派後，即港行　備工作，　定本市西長與路地方檢察　內西部大樓爲庭址。茲已準備就緒，並定於今日（一日）正式成立。開始辦公。聞該庭內部亂　，在庭長以下，設　記總，專員室，書記職由書記官長主持，下設總務紀錄二科，重要人事均已決定。記者爲明瞭該分庭今後處理方針起見，特總　該分庭蔡院長。承發表談話如次：</p>
<p>庭長談話</p>
<p>「近數年來，世風日下，不　官吏，　法營私，無識商民，　　操縱，以致民生日　，綱紀蕩然。政府　然愛之，深知平時之汗毛，不足以應戰時之需要，乃有公務員犯　治罪條例，戰時刑事特別法，及　積主要商品治罪條例等之制定。又以普通司法機關審級太多，一案確定歷時甚久，不足以收懲　之速效，於是復組織特別法庭，以簡單迅速之程序，審理遠犯上開各法中指定各條之事件，並以危害民國緊急治罪法第一條至第六條，及弄法第三百三十九條至第三百四十一條，第三百四十六條至三百四十八各罪，亦得由特別法庭審理，一經判決核准，立即執行。政府此項措施，固關治亂用重，然一方面實冀國人有所警惕，以過止此類事件之發生，亦處書所謂：“辟以止辟刑期無刑”之意。首都特別法成立以來，辦理貪汚案件，業有多起，當爲國人所共聞共見，政府以上海地居重要，情懷列，實有在滬設立專庭，就近處理上述案件之必要，及有特別法庭上海紛庭組織條例之頒布。本庭遵令組織，已於本日成立，本人忝任庭長，深　弗克勝任，關後如奉政府發交案件，必當審　辦理，務得情法之平，期無　毫枉縱。所望全市人士，各　　刑之訓，毋貧不義這財，俾此類案件，絕少發生，得臻於刑措，實爲國家社會之福。」</p>
<h3>盧副局長報告　改革警政概況　出席記者例會答覆問題</h3>
<p>市宣傳處主持之記者例會，於昨（三十一）日下午二時半，假市政府二樓會議室舉行，由市警罕局副局長盧英，出席報告最近　政改革概況，總即答覆各報社記者所提問題多則，盧氏除力申改革警政決心外，復盼對於員警不良行爲，隨時與警局聯絡，傳得改善等語。茲分證如次：</p>
<p>報告概況</p>
<p>提高待遇</p>
<p>本局自週市長兼任局長以後，對於提高員　待遇一　，業已實施，按照目前情形，市警士最　（三等）每月可得餉　一萬四百七十五元，　長（三等）每月可得餉　一萬六千二百五十元，　區　士　低每月一萬零四百七十五元，警長每月一萬一千九百五十元，同時按月發　免　亂給　米，分　重　。結婚。級已而有子女者三類，自二鬥半。四鬥。至六鬥，職員待遇，亦同樣提高，最低委任級，每月可得薪　一萬八千三百二十五元，免盡配給亦同。</p>
<p>調整人事</p>
<p>一面調整人事，增強行政效率，對於年老力衰，能力薄弱，品行不良，以及不必要之　　員　，於以　汰，截止目前，共裁雲官長警伕二千八百七十五人，（除總局外有三十八個單位）包皓中印　外各籍、其中法　人員，可說已全部辭退。</p>
<p>統一服裝</p>
<p>琺於服裝一項，過雲因種種關係，式樣頗不一致，不但有　觀　，亦且違背法令，業已通令所　，加以修改，以資　一等。職名亦予調整，（階級）如警監、警正、　佐。仍舊沿用，所有助理員，事務員名　，一律　正，改爲同警正，同警佐，（職員）則依照中央規定，以局長，副局長，處長，科長，科員，辦事員，巡官，　員等爲標凖。</p>
<p>整　勤務</p>
<p>他如勤務力面，亦竭方整　，在總局則加強督察工作，有功必賞，有過必懲，決不徇情，在分局，則減少崗位，增加巡邏，二月以來。雖不能說弊絕風清，但員警沿途或案之風，確已減少。各位均係與論代表，民　喉舌，譫雲：旁觀者清，當局者迷。此後希望各位不客氣的隨時指導，不但我本人一定誠意接受，同時我相信我們的長官，也沒有不樂意接受的。</p>
<p>答覆問題</p>
<p>取締賭博</p>
<p>一本市臨風日　如何處　？查　禁賭博當局早下決心，近來本市賭風日　，本局早有所聞，業已通令所　　行取締，一經查　，無不依法究辦。關於此類案件，每日必有數起，惟本局並不宴會，希望各位盡量採訪批露。上月間拘獲外籍黃金奸商百餘人，結果如何？此事侮虱經濟保安措置，惟所拘之人犯，並非黃金奸商，乃是沿街猶太人，因其有　　敵性國貨幣之嫌，故加以警告後，數小時內即全體釋放。</p>
<p>拘捕遊民</p>
<p>本市已經完成之防空　，往往為一乞丐遊民　居吸毒，當局是否注意及此？查乞丐遊民前會　令所　隨時拘捕，移送勞動營，惟數額有限，且勞動營本身對於食糧等問題，發生種種關係，故不能盡是容納，上述情形，如果　　，本局自當注意取締。</p>
<p>蔣　彥案</p>
<p>旅客徐佩文之兇手彥拘捕後，審訊手　進行如何？將以何罪　起公訴？此案現已　　　押，尚在分局繼續偵查中，善於審訊手　進行如何，在未曾公開發表前，　便發表，至於提起公訴一節，系屬法院　權，本局未便顧問。</p>
<p>偵訊用刑</p>
<p>各分局偵查案情時，仍有使用型訊者，對此有何意見？對於偵查案情使用刑訊，早經三令五申絕對禁止，如果仍有上述情形，可盡是檢舉。</p>
<p>各縣區警察局配備未見充實，對於維護他方治安，不無影響，請問有何對策？查各縣區警察局向來均有槍械，惟市府現已成立縣政管理處，所有各縣警察事宜，應由該處辦理。</p>
<p>車站秩序</p>
<p>本月十六日警察局與華中錢道公司曾聯席會議，討論整頓車站秩序辦法，其具體對策如何？此事現正由朽　密　訂辦法中，將來對於正當旅客疏散人民，以及公務人員均須有證明文件，即可購票登車，是項辦法，大約下月即可公佈實施</p>
<p>最近　　線輪船船標，正當旅客　買不易，必須求　黑市，對於市民疏散返鄉，影響頗大，未知警局如何取締？此事北站情形大致相同，本局自當考慮對策，予以取締。</p>

<h3>Enemy Ships and Vessels around the Ryukyu Islands: 50 Sunk and Destroyed; Fierce Attacks by Air and Naval Forces Yield Results</h3>
<p>Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announcement</p>
<p>Tokyo, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced the following war situation in the Ryukyu Islands area at 4:30 PM on the 31st: Although the attacks by enemy mobile force carrier-based aircraft have ceased since March 30th, intense naval gunfire continues to be directed at Okinawa Island. Japanese air and naval forces have attacked enemy ships and vessels, and the confirmed results are as follows: Two aircraft carriers sunk, one battleship sunk, four cruisers sunk, six destroyers sunk, one transport ship sunk, and sixteen vessels of unknown type sunk. One battleship damaged, one battleship or cruiser damaged, one cruiser damaged, five destroyers damaged, one transport ship damaged, and eleven vessels of unknown type damaged.</p>
<p>Central Pacific, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The enemy mobile force in the seas and skies of Okinawa Island is continuously reinforcing its strength from the rear. Dozens of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers approach Okinawa Island and continue to patrol near Okinawa Island on the 30th. On the morning of the 31st, a portion of the enemy forces, including several battleships, approached Kume Island. Although dense fog covered the southwest area on the 30th, the enemy still launched approximately 300 carrier-based aircraft to attack various locations. The Japanese forces engaged in fierce fighting, and by dawn on the 30th, Japanese torpedo boats had sunk one enemy cruiser and one destroyer, and also sunk one enemy submarine.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers and Civilians on Okinawa Island Await Orders, Preparing for a Great Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>Tokyo, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The enemy forces closing in on the Okinawa fortress have launched an attack with their main forces. The Japanese army, in defense of the homeland, is fighting bravely. Thanks to the do-or-die efforts of the air and naval forces, two enemy aircraft carriers and fifty other enemy ships have been sunk, and thirty-nine battleships and other vessels have been damaged, resulting in the destruction of countless lives and vast amounts of supplies. Under these glorious achievements, morale is further boosted. Today, Japanese air forces continue to sortie bravely, and are relentlessly attacking the enemy fleet that is still patrolling near Okinawa Island and concentrating intense artillery fire on the southern part of the island, expanding the battle results. The results achieved so far are comparable to the combined achievements of the naval battles in the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf, where the enemy invasion forces were intercepted. It is expected that the enemy, having suffered bloodshed, will react with extreme caution. Furthermore, although enemy support ships continue to be sunk near Okinawa, they continue to reinforce their forces, but these are merely bait for the Japanese army, so future results will be even greater. In addition, the Japanese ground forces on Okinawa Island are also awaiting orders with intense and magnificent emotions.</p>
<p>Tokyo, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The enemy American forces are attempting to invade the Ryukyu Islands, so they have deployed the Pacific Fleet to gradually occupy the various islands of the Ryukyu Islands, with the attack on Okinawa Island being particularly fierce, and there is a strong possibility of an imminent landing. At the same time, the enemy relies on its vast war power to directly attack the various islands. Its mobile force is approaching the Kyushu region and is still patrolling in Japanese waters, with the apparent goal of cutting off the Japanese supply lines to the Ryukyu Islands battlefront. The enemy gunboats' bombardment of Okinawa Island is intensifying daily, averaging 500 rounds per day until the 27th, increasing to 2,000 rounds on the 28th, and reaching 7,000 rounds on the 29th. The operational activities of the enemy fleet around Okinawa Island are similar to the situation before the landing on Iwo Jima. Furthermore, small flotillas are approaching Okinawa Island along with the fleet, which confirms that the date of the enemy's operation to seize the island is approaching. The Japanese air and naval forces and special attack units are continuing to launch do-or-die attacks on enemy ships and vessels daily, achieving considerable results. In addition, the ground forces and civilians on Okinawa Island are actively preparing, hoping to launch a great decisive battle where one Japanese soldier kills ten enemies when the enemy troops step onto the island.</p>
<h3>B-29 Enemy Aircraft Raid Nagoya and Invade the Vicinity of Shonan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Approximately 50 B-29 type aircraft from the Mariana base raided Nagoya for about one and a half hours starting at 9:30 PM on the 30th. The remainder targeted the Hiroshima and Kure areas.</p>
<p>Shonan, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Approximately 20 enemy B-29 type aircraft invaded the vicinity of Shonan around 1:00 AM on the 29th and withdrew at 3:30 AM. Around 2:05 AM on the morning of the 30th, approximately 30 more B-29 type aircraft attacked the vicinity of Shonan, dropping bombs before withdrawing around 4:30 AM. The damage to the Japanese side was minor.</p>
<h3>President of the Japan-China General Association Appointed Imperial-Nominated Member of the House of Peers</h3>
<p>Tokyo, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese government specially recommended General Jiro Minami, President of the Great Japan Political Association, as an Imperial-nominated member of the House of Peers.

<h3>Graduation Ceremony for Officer Trainees; Training Speech by Commander Chen, Emphasizing Cultivation and Providing Encouragement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Twenty officer trainees from the seventh class of the Central Army Officer Training Corps completed their training, and a graduation ceremony was held at 9:00 AM on the 31st. Commander Chen personally attended and delivered a training speech, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>I feel that the general public, whether young people or soldiers, lacks cultivation. Cultivation means that one must constantly study one's knowledge and constantly review one's actions. Cultivation is not a difficult problem. If one knows what needs to be done and constantly studies it, one can develop a habit. If one does not do what one should do, one will feel uneasy in one's heart. If one does what one should not do, one's conscience will be punished. People generally develop bad habits due to tradition, which hinders their progress in life and has a great impact on the nation. This is caused by a lack of cultivation.</p>
<p>Uphold Discipline, Unity of Knowledge and Action</p>
<p>Upholding discipline is a habit. If junior officers develop good habits, they do not necessarily need the supervision of their superiors. Upholding discipline is a form of cultivation, also known as character, which is a traditional habit. Mr. Wang Yangming said: "Knowing without acting cannot be called knowing." The unity of knowledge and action is the greatest goal of cultivation, and one must also be consistent in words and deeds. What we say, we must put into practice. It is better not to say what we cannot do. Now, many young people are either too unrestrained or too decadent, without any cultivation. In the past, when we were students, before entering military school, we felt very resentful towards the warlords. We felt very happy when we saw the opinions in the newspapers. At the same time, we saw many comrades who gradually went down the path of the warlords after entering military school. What is the reason for this? It is because of insufficient cultivation.</p>
<p>China is facing many difficulties at this stage. People generally only care about solving their own difficulties and do not care about the happiness of others. They only care about their own convenience and do not care about the convenience of others. This is a lack of cultivation, which has resulted in bad habits and has become a common problem. So-called learning and cultivation mean not causing difficulties for others, and not sacrificing the convenience of others for one's own convenience. Only in this way can one become a perfect person, and the army can become a perfect army.</p>
<p>Words and Deeds of Famous Generals Can Serve as Models</p>
<p>I hope that after returning to your posts, you will use the words and deeds of famous generals in history as a reference. How they commanded their subordinates, how they sought to create happiness for the country and the people, because learning is experience, which is the accumulated conclusion of success. Of course, we ourselves are not enough. We must also use the words and deeds of famous people in history and the words and deeds of famous generals as an aid to our own words and deeds. This is the most important thing. Secondly, we should also pay attention to making friends. We can also get a lot of help from friends, but we must make good friends. Today, I am not speaking as an officer, but as a senior telling you my experience as a farewell gift.</p>
<h3>Women and Children in Berlin Ordered to Evacuate</h3>

<h3>Notes on Attending the Wartime People's Representative Conference</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>March 28th, a clear morning. The National Assembly Hall on Guofu Road was decorated with a sign that reads, "Wartime People's Representative Conference of Various Provinces and Cities." The venue was on the second floor, neatly arranged, and the walls were covered with large slogans, the most notable of which were "Tell the Truth Responsibly" and "Open Speech to Express Public Opinion."</p>
<p>Portraits of Representatives</p>
<p>There were eighteen units participating in the conference, with forty-nine representatives present. The representatives included professors, doctors, and businessmen, with elderly people with white hair and energetic young people. Their clothing varied, including long gowns and mandarin jackets, and Western suits. The "New People's Dress" of the representatives from the North was particularly unique. Since the representatives came from different provinces and cities, their dialects also differed. The chairman found it quite difficult to manage during the discussions.</p>
<p>Conference Atmosphere</p>
<p>On the second day of the conference, the discussions on war-related issues were heated, with speakers eager to express their views. Often, debates would last for a long time over a slight difference in wording. In particular, the passionate speeches and unique insights of Mr. Pan Junqian and Mr. Zhao Songpo, representatives from Tianjin, earned them considerable applause, adding color to the conference.</p>
<p>A Tense Moment</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the second day of the conference, just as Mr. Pan Junqian, a representative from Tianjin, was describing the harm caused by opium in Tianjin, air raid sirens blared. Ten enemy aircraft appeared in the sky, the sound of the engines clattering, corresponding to the booming sound of anti-aircraft guns. For safety, the chairman proposed a temporary adjournment, but after only five minutes, the enemy aircraft moved further away, and the representatives returned to the venue to continue the discussion. Unexpectedly, after a few more minutes, the enemy aircraft returned, flying very low, skimming over the roof of the venue, and indiscriminately firing machine guns, resulting in sixteen civilian deaths and injuries in the vicinity. At the time, the representatives disregarded the danger and returned to the venue to continue the meeting before the air raid alert was lifted. Their patriotic sincerity was admirable.</p>
<p>A Batch of Proposals</p>
<p>There were twenty-four proposals at the conference, the content of which was primarily related to national planning and people's livelihoods. Except for those that were similar and merged, fourteen proposals were formally passed. Among the important proposals in the category of national planning were the "Request to the Government to Protect the People's Freedom of Speech and Assembly, Adopt Public Opinion, and Establish Public Opinion Organs," proposed by Mr. Xu Lie and Mr. Xu Guangda, representatives from Beiping, as well as the "Launch a Unified National Salvation Movement to Inherit the Legacy of the National Father and Complete the Revolution" and "Unify the National Administrative System and Complete National Independence and Unity as Soon as Possible." Regarding people's livelihoods, in addition to the "Strengthen Local Security to Save Lives" and "Stabilize Food Prices and Facilitate the Transportation of Materials to Maintain the People's Livelihoods," the most notable proposal was the "Thoroughly Strengthen the National Anti-Opium Movement and Request the Government to Implement a Strict Anti-Opium Policy," proposed by the Tianjin representative. The representative bitterly denounced the harm of drugs, speaking with alarm, saying that there were more than 130,000 opium addicts in Tianjin, North China, accounting for one-tenth of the city's population, and more than 200 opium dens. It was even said that some were addicted to opium even before the age of twenty. The "Li Zhan" area in the bustling district of Tianjin was planning to open fifty opium dens, but the matter was stopped after opposition from the city's Anti-Opium Association and enthusiastic individuals. The city has now established the "Tianjin National Anti-Opium Association Smoking Cessation Hospital," which uses the "Dongguang Agent" smoking cessation drug invented by Dr. Zhengshan of a friendly country, which can eliminate opium addiction within forty-two hours. It has been repeatedly tested and is effective, curing many opium addicts. It is a pity that the original inventor keeps the prescription of the drug a secret, so it cannot be mass-produced to save opium addicts across the country from suffering.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces on the North Coast of New Guinea Launch a Night Attack, Completely Occupying the Enemy Positions at Sansapor</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Japanese forces in the northern New Guinea area attacked enemy positions at Sansapor on the moonlit night of February 20th and completely occupied them. The enemy landed a large number of mobile forces in the area on March 21st of last year and installed acoustic devices around the airfield and positions to warn of approaching Japanese forces. In December of last year, after destroying the enemy positions, Japanese forces launched a fierce attack on Sansapor on the moonlit night of February 20th, and the enemy desperately resisted with land and naval forces, including hasty bombing, the dispatch of destroyers, and minesweepers, but all were repelled by the Japanese forces and retreated to the Mair area. The enemy forces in Sansapor were the advanced base for protecting the Mair airfield, and after the Japanese forces occupied it, they can ensure the stronghold on the northern coast of western New Guinea, and the Mair airfield has great military significance.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces Attempt to Encircle the Ruhr Area; German Forces Taking Effective Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Berlin, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Reuter reports: Montgomery's intention to encircle the Ruhr area is becoming increasingly clear. The pressure of the British Second Army northward and eastward is greater than the pressure southwest towards the Ruhr industrial area. The anti-Axis forces have made little progress after crossing the Glebbeck, but their northern vanguard has advanced past Stadtlohn and Dulmen, pushing towards Munster. The vanguard in the south is advancing north and northeast from Marburg. If these northern and southern vanguards can meet in the Munster, Paderborn, and Kassel area, the Ruhr industrial area will be completely surrounded. The straight-line distance between the two vanguards is still over 100 kilometers, and the German authorities will undoubtedly strive to prevent the enemy from completing this plan. The enemy is still continuing to attack the German defensive positions between the Rhine, Ruhr, and Sieg rivers, and there have also been further attempts by the enemy to cross the river between Düsseldorf and Leverkusen in an attempt to attack the Ruhr industrial area from the front.</p>
<h3>Voting Rights Issue in the San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>Lisbon, March 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: According to a Washington dispatch: The Japanese consulate announced on the 29th that, during the Yalta Conference, the Soviet representatives requested recognition of the voting rights of the Byelorussian and Ukrainian republics, so the Soviet Union could obtain three votes in the General Assembly. The American representatives also made securing three votes a condition. According to a London dispatch: Although Britain recognized the Soviet Union's three votes during the conference, it did not recognize the American three votes, and it was shocked by the American government's announcement.</p>
<p>Weekly Review</p>
<h3>China's Foundational Construction</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiangrong</p>
<p>In the past half-year, the atmosphere of overall peace has been very strong, and the public's expectation for overall peace has become increasingly urgent. However, up to now, we have not been able to find the slightest glimmer of hope. Not only that, but with the support of Britain and the United States, Chongqing has launched a general counter-offensive against mainland China. Under these circumstances, is the realization of overall peace still possible? In our opinion, the realization of overall peace is absolutely possible, because its realization is not the hope of a certain part, but a historical necessity. In other words, the occurrence of the Sino-Japanese Incident has its historical inevitability, and the end of the Sino-Japanese Incident also has its historical inevitability. Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, we believe that a comprehensive solution must be reached. But why is it still so clueless today? In our view, it is because the Chinese side has not been able to possess the conditions to cope with this historical necessity. The so-called conditions to cope with this historical necessity are the failure to complete China's foundational construction and the failure to establish a foundational perspective.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Sino-Japanese issue must be resolved comprehensively, and everyone also knows that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese issue is a political rather than a military matter. However, no one can calmly review the Sino-Japanese issue. We have seen that in recent years, the opinions in the peace zone have mostly been saying things that the Japanese love to hear. And what about the anti-Japanese war zone? It specializes in attacking Japan. In our view, both of these attitudes seem to obliterate the facts and distort the truth. They have not been able to speak from the standpoint of the Chinese people! Their arguments are solely based on emotion. In our view, this kind of emotion-based approach to examining and handling the Sino-Japanese issue is the greatest crisis for the future of China and Japan. But unfortunately, today's China is full of this high-pitched rhetoric.</p>
<p>Since the incident, over the past eight years, the Japanese side, whether government or civilian, has been able to adapt to the times and appropriately change its policies. In our view, this change in policy is a kind of self-reflection on the part of Japan. Why does Japan need to constantly reflect on itself? Because the world situation is constantly changing, and countries that survive in this environment cannot but change with it. But what about our country? Apart from hearing some high-pitched rhetoric, we can also get a principle, which is to respond to all changes with constancy. In the eyes of us young people, this attitude is very disappointing. We believe that whether we are examining a comprehensive solution to the Sino-Japanese issue or planning the post-war revival and construction of China, today, we Chinese must have a universal and thorough introspection movement. In our view, this introspection movement is the foundational construction of China.</p>
<p>We believe that when examining a comprehensive solution to the Sino-Japanese issue, we must have a basic concept, which is that China is a country that needs to survive independently, and Japan is also a country that needs to survive independently. When discussing China's post-war reconstruction, we also have a basic concept, which is that China must be an independent and autonomous country before we can talk about revival and reconstruction. This basic concept is the establishment of a Chinese foundational perspective and the completion of Chinese foundational construction.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Mr. Fan Zhongyun and other ten professors issued a declaration on the construction of Chinese foundational culture, advocating neither complete Westernization nor complete Easternization, to save Chinese culture from the misfortune it suffered after the May Fourth Movement. At that time, the situation they encountered was not as difficult or as complex as it is today. Therefore, they only focused on the cultural aspect. But in today's situation, we believe that the construction of China's foundation is no longer applicable only to the cultural aspect, but also universally applicable to politics, economy, and military affairs. Therefore, we dare to use the strength of our few people to propose this slogan of building China's foundation. The construction of China's foundation is a very empty slogan. How can we complete the construction of China's foundation and establish a Chinese foundational perspective? Although we are all laymen in politics, we are also very willing to point out more concrete ways.</p>
<p>We believe that in today's situation, a comprehensive reform must be carried out. Political reform should strengthen the National Government and establish the basic strength for negotiating peace. Economic reform should stabilize people's livelihoods and cultivate national strength. Military reform should defend the country and assist in combat. Cultural reform should establish a new ethical outlook. To be more specific, in politics, we must point out that the Republic of China is unified, regardless of east, south, west, or north. In other words, the Republic of China must be a unified Republic of China. We also believe that talent must be the main focus, that the one-party dictatorship must be opened up, and that the legitimate freedom of the people must be guaranteed. In diplomacy, we should work with all friendly countries to seek construction from the standpoint of the Chinese people. In economics, we should establish thorough state capitalism, build a heavy industry China, and eliminate all disputes over interests through the control of state capital. In the military, we advocate centralized military power and oppose warlord separatism. In culture, we hope to use our inherent culture as a foundation, and absorb and digest foreign cultures to integrate them into a new culture. We believe that the future of the Chinese nation and the revival of the Republic of China must not be allowed to be manipulated by a few people. We do not want to revolt, nor do we have political ambitions, but we are a part of the Chinese nation, so we demand comprehensive reform.</p>
<p>Seventy years ago, China and Japan jointly sought reform, but seventy years later, Japan has become one of the world's great powers, while China has become weak and不堪. The biggest reason for this is that the Japanese can talk about reform from their own perspective. But we Chinese have always wanted to rely on others. Therefore, seventy years later, the results we can see are also vastly different. The Meiji Restoration in Japan created Japan, one of the four great modern powers, but the result of our Reform Movement of 1898 and revolution has deepened our semi-colonial status. This historical lesson makes us unable to not rise up again today. At the same time, the situation around us does not allow us to deceive others anymore. So at this time, we, with the strength of a few young people, put forward this slogan.</p>
<p>We demand that all Chinese people stand on China's foundation and strive for China's independence under this condition. We know very well that the establishment of a Chinese foundational perspective and the completion of Chinese foundational construction depend on the assistance of allied countries, but as the saying goes: "Heaven helps those who help themselves." Therefore, we believe that in the process of this movement, the most important thing is to rely on Chinese people with a sense of national concept to fight for the assistance of allied countries with the Chinese foundational struggle. We oppose all ideas of relying on external forces. We believe that as long as we can grasp reality, recognize the future, and continue to work hard, our future is bright. Conversely, no matter how much the allied countries assist us, it will be in vain!</p>
<p>Time does not allow us to procrastinate and deceive ourselves any longer. Japan has already begun the mobilization of the national armed forces, which is related to the fate of the nation. We do not demand a revolution, but we are a part of the Chinese nation, so we ask our compatriots to be aware and to reflect. And we ask our government to complete the foundational construction of China through comprehensive reforms, and to promote the realization of overall peace and the comprehensive solution of the Sino-Japanese issue through our own efforts.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the People's Representative Assembly (Continued)</h3>
<p>Relieving People's Suffering</p>
<p>We demand reasonable economic measures to resolve the suffering of the people. In his Principle of People's Livelihood, the National Father advocated equalizing land ownership and regulating capital, aiming to protect national capital in order to resist the economic aggression of colonialism, while at the same time limiting the expansion of private capital, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of European and American capitalism. At present, the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. If we do not quickly find ways to provide relief, the 400 million compatriots will have no way out. The war is the root cause. The war has led to insufficient production, inconvenient transportation, lack of raw materials, increased consumption, soaring prices, falling currency values, the deterioration of landlords, the heavy exploitation of corrupt forces, and the local distribution of spoils by corrupt officials. All of these are factors that have contributed to the suffering of the people today. We have personally experienced and suffered deeply in various places. We sincerely hope that the government will find ways to treat the symptoms and prescribe the right medicine, and strive to relieve one point of suffering for every point of suffering that can be relieved, and implement one step of measures for every step of measures that can be implemented, such as suppressing food prices, dredging up sources of materials, improving the material control system, strengthening industrial and commercial organizations, rectifying commercial ethics, and revitalizing light industry. We also hope that the government will find ways to implement these measures as soon as possible, and that the people should also conserve consumption as much as possible, increase production, and cooperate with the government.</p>
<p>National Armed Self-Defense</p>
<p>We must consolidate public security and complete the organization of national armed self-defense. In the National Father's teachings, communism has always been regarded as the source of national and social turmoil. Therefore, in his lectures on the Principle of People's Livelihood, the National Father specifically pointed out the errors of Marxist communism. The National Father's original intention of accommodating the Communists was to encourage the Communist Party to abandon its organization and ideology, join the Kuomintang, and follow the Three Principles of the People. This was clearly stated in the joint declaration of the National Father and Joffe. However, the Communist Party broke faith and attempted to seize the leadership of the National Revolution. Therefore, the Kuomintang decided to purge the Communists and further encircle and suppress them. Since the incident occurred, the communist bandits have taken advantage of the name of resisting Japan and saving the country. Over the years, the flames of communism have risen sharply, and wherever they go, they are like locusts. In the future, we must consolidate local public security, so that the people can live and work in peace, and universally implement military training, and ultimately form a national armed self-defense organization.</p>
<p>Hoping to See Implementation</p>
<p>The above six points are believed to be the key to alleviating the current difficult situation. If they can be implemented one by one, the improvement of other social education and cultural aspects can also be implemented step by step. We respectfully request the National Government to implement them separately as soon as possible, in order to comfort public opinion, and we also hope that our compatriots in the mainland will unite with us and continue the peace, anti-communist, and nation-building movement led by the late Chairman Wang during his lifetime, to realize the unfulfilled wishes of the National Father since his death twenty years ago, and to complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People under the leadership of Chairman Chen. This is our declaration.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Sub-Court of the Special Court Officially Established Today: Court President Cai Talks About Future Handling Policies</h3>
<p>The National Government, in order to punish corrupt officials and eliminate illegal merchants, reduce litigation procedures, and strive for speedy handling of cases, specially established a Special Court in the capital last March. In this city, the 66th Supreme Defense Council also decided to set up a sub-court, and specially appointed Cai Rixin, the former Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court, as the court president, with Zhao Zhengdang and Gao Nanqu as judges. Since accepting the appointment, Court President Cai has been making preparations and has decided to use the western building of the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office on Xichang Road as the court address. Now it is ready, and it will be officially established today (the 1st) and start working. It is reported that the internal organization of the court, under the court president, has a general office and a specialist office. The secretariat is presided over by the chief clerk, and there are two sections: general affairs and records. Important personnel have been decided. In order to understand the future handling policies of the sub-court, the reporter interviewed Court President Cai. He kindly gave the following statement:</p>
<p>Court President's Statement</p>
<p>"In recent years, the world has been deteriorating, and dishonest officials have been engaging in private gain, and ignorant merchants have been manipulating prices, resulting in the people's livelihood becoming increasingly difficult and the rule of law being lost. The government cherishes the people and knows that the usual measures are not enough to meet the needs of wartime. Therefore, the Regulations on Punishing Crimes Committed by Public Servants, the Special Criminal Law in Wartime, and the Regulations on Punishing Crimes of Hoarding Important Commodities have been formulated. Moreover, because ordinary judicial organs have too many levels of review, and it takes a long time to finalize a case, which is not enough to achieve the quick effect of punishment, the Special Court has been organized to hear cases that violate the specified articles in the above-mentioned laws through simple and quick procedures, and the crimes in Articles 1 to 6 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China and Articles 339 to 341 and 346 to 348 of the Law on Offenses can also be tried by the Special Court. Once a judgment is approved, it will be executed immediately. This measure of the government is indeed important for governance and chaos, but on the one hand, it is hoped that the people of the country will be vigilant, so as to prevent the occurrence of such incidents. It is also the meaning of what the book says: "Punish to stop punishment, and hope for no punishment." Since the establishment of the Special Court in the capital, many cases of corruption have been handled, which has been heard and seen by the people of the country. The government believes that Shanghai is an important place and should set up a special court in Shanghai to handle the above-mentioned cases nearby. The Special Court Shanghai Sub-Court Organization Regulations have been promulgated. This court has been organized in accordance with the order and was established today. I am honored to be the court president, and I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to do the job well. In the future, if I receive cases issued by the government, I must handle them carefully, so as to ensure fairness and impartiality, and not to wrongly acquit anyone. I hope that all people in the city will follow the teachings of the law, not covet wealth through illegal means, so that such cases rarely occur, and the law can be used without punishment, which is a blessing for the country and society."</p>
<h3>Deputy Director Lu Reports on the Overview of Police Reform and Answers Questions at the Press Conference</h3>
<p>The press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was held at 2:30 p.m. yesterday (the 31st) in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government. Lu Ying, Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Department, attended the meeting to report on the recent overview of police reform and answered many questions raised by reporters from various newspapers. In addition to strongly declaring his determination to reform the police, Lu also hoped that he could contact the police department at any time regarding the bad behavior of police officers to improve them. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Report on the Overview</p>
<p>Raising Salaries</p>
<p>Since Mayor Zhou took office as the director of the police department, the issue of raising the salaries of police officers has been implemented. According to the current situation, the lowest-ranking (third-class) municipal police officer can receive a monthly salary of 14,475 yuan, the squad leader (third-class) can receive a monthly salary of 16,250 yuan, and the district police officer can receive a monthly salary of 14,475 yuan, and the police chief can receive a monthly salary of 11,950 yuan. At the same time, rice is issued monthly, and there are three categories for those who are married or have children: two and a half, four, and six dou. The salaries of staff members have also been increased, with the lowest-ranking appointee receiving a monthly salary of 18,325 yuan, and the same distribution of rice.</p>
<p>Adjusting Personnel</p>
<p>On the one hand, we are adjusting personnel to enhance administrative efficiency. For those who are old and weak, incompetent, have bad character, and unnecessary personnel, we are eliminating them. As of now, a total of 2,875 officials, officers, and police have been laid off (38 units in addition to the General Bureau), including all French personnel and other nationalities who were hired.</p>
<p>Uniforming Uniforms</p>
<p>Regarding uniforms, in the past, due to various reasons, the styles were quite inconsistent, which was not only unsightly but also violated the law. We have already ordered all units to modify them to be uniform. The titles have also been adjusted. (Ranks) such as police superintendent, police inspector, and police officer are still in use. All assistant staff and administrative staff titles are unified and changed to the same as police inspector and police officer. (Staff) are in accordance with the central government's regulations, with the titles of director, deputy director, department head, section chief, section member, clerk, inspector, and police officer as the standard.</p>
<p>Rectifying Duty</p>
<p>In other aspects of duty, we are also trying our best to rectify. In the General Bureau, we are strengthening the supervision work, and we will reward those who have merit and punish those who have made mistakes, and we will never show favoritism. In the branch bureaus, we are reducing posts and increasing patrols. Since February, although we cannot say that all evils have been eliminated, the practice of police officers extorting money along the way has indeed decreased. You are all representatives of public opinion and mouthpieces of the people. As the saying goes: "The bystander sees more than the player." In the future, I hope that you will not hesitate to guide us at any time. Not only will I personally accept it sincerely, but I also believe that our superiors will be happy to accept it.</p>
<p>Answering Questions</p>
<p>Suppressing Gambling</p>
<p>How should the authorities deal with the increasing gambling in this city? The authorities have long been determined to ban gambling. The bureau has heard about the increasing gambling in this city recently and has ordered all units to carry out suppression. Once discovered, they will be investigated and dealt with according to law. There are several such cases every day, but the bureau does not hold banquets. I hope you will try your best to report them. What was the outcome of the arrest of more than 100 foreign gold merchants last month? This matter involves economic security measures. However, the detainees were not gold merchants but Jews along the street. Because they were suspected of possessing enemy currency, they were warned and released within a few hours.</p>
<p>Detaining Vagrants</p>
<p>The air-raid shelters that have been completed in this city are often occupied by beggars and vagrants who live and use drugs. Is the authorities paying attention to this? In the past, we have ordered all units to arrest vagrants at any time and transfer them to labor camps. However, the number is limited, and the labor camps themselves have various problems with food and other issues, so they cannot accommodate all of them. If the above situation is reported, the bureau will pay attention to it and take measures to suppress it.</p>
<p>Jiang Yanyan Case</p>
<p>After the murderer Yanyan, who killed the traveler Xu Peiwen, was arrested, what is the progress of the interrogation? What crime will he be prosecuted for? This case is currently under detention and is still under investigation by the branch bureau. As for the progress of the interrogation, it is not convenient to disclose it before it is publicly announced. As for the prosecution, it is the power of the court, and the bureau is not in a position to comment.</p>
<p>Torture During Interrogation</p>
<p>Some branch bureaus still use torture when investigating cases. What are your opinions on this? The use of torture during interrogation has been repeatedly prohibited. If there are still such cases, you can report them as much as possible.</p>
<p>The equipment of the police stations in various counties and districts is not sufficient, which will inevitably affect the maintenance of public security in other places. What countermeasures do you have? The police stations in various counties and districts have always had firearms. However, the Municipal Government has now established a county administration, and all police matters in various counties should be handled by the administration.</p>
<p>Station Order</p>
<p>On the 16th of this month, the Police Department and China Central Railway Company held a joint meeting to discuss measures to rectify the order of the station. What are the specific countermeasures? This matter is currently being drafted by the company. In the future, legitimate travelers will have to provide documents to disperse the people, and government employees must have proof documents to purchase tickets and board the train. This measure will be announced and implemented next month.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been difficult for legitimate travelers to buy tickets for the Shanghai-Nanjing route, and they have to seek out the black market, which has a great impact on the evacuation of citizens to their hometowns. How does the police department plan to crack down on this? The situation in the North Station is roughly the same. The bureau will consider countermeasures and crack down on it.</p>

<h3>Coastal Defense Headquarters Discovers Illegal Activities by Subordinates, Resolves to Impose Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coastal Defense Headquarters, to ensure maritime security and enhance wartime transportation capabilities, has been working tirelessly with the assistance of the Allied Japanese military authorities on coastal defense in recent years. However, recently, it received a report alleging that Zhang Ke, the commander of the shipping battalion stationed at Ruiji Sandbar, and his subordinates were colluding with the opposing side to plunder cargo ships. The Headquarters immediately dispatched personnel to investigate. The investigation revealed that the team was indeed engaged in these illegal activities, and that the third company commander, Gong Zhuping, on April 20th, led dozens of his subordinates, carrying two machine guns, fifteen rifles, two quick-firing rifles, and four submachine guns, aboard two sailboats, and secretly entered the waters controlled by Zhang Ali's force. The Headquarters immediately ordered Hu Guan, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, and his subordinates to, together with the Allied Japanese garrison, proceed on the afternoon of the 28th, to order the disbandment of the team, and to detain all personnel. Except for Zhang and several subordinates who escaped beforehand, the remaining seven officers and eighty-nine soldiers were detained at the time, and forty-nine rifles, three submachine guns, twenty-nine hand grenades, and seven hundred rounds of ammunition were seized. The Headquarters is currently conducting a thorough investigation of the detainees and has resolved to impose severe punishment.</p>

<h3>Mr. Yan Junren's Birthday Celebration Funds Transferred to Aid the Anti-Tuberculosis Association</h3>
<p>Mr. Yan Junren is a man of great talent and virtue, admired both at home and abroad. In recent years, he has retired to Shanghai and shown concern for his homeland, providing much support for charitable and educational causes. This year, on his sixty-ninth birthday in early April according to the lunar calendar, Mr. Yan, in consideration of the difficult times, was unwilling to hold any celebrations. However, after repeated requests from relatives and friends, and considering that the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association's First and Second Lung Hospitals and clinics have been operating for many years, with considerable achievements in tuberculosis prevention, and that they provide treatment and work for the needy, relying on donations from all sectors of society for support, and that recent price increases have made it difficult to continue, with an estimated shortfall of 8 million yuan for this year, he generously agreed to transfer all the funds collected from relatives and friends to aid the Association's expenses. Seven institutions in this city, including the Continental Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, China Enterprise Bank, Songhua Bank, Jiuan Bank, Shen Bao Newspaper, and Xinwen Bao Newspaper, have been appointed to collect the birthday donations. Mr. Yan has extensive connections, and the number of people sending birthday gifts is considerable each day. In addition to issuing receipts, the names of the donors will also be published successively.</p>
