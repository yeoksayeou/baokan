<h3>葫蘆島錦州均收復　瀋陽長春二三週可下　洛蓋少將昨由渝返滬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿五日電〕據此間今日報載，中央軍已於星期四午夜收復葫蘆島，港中設備僅稍受損害。是此，則中央軍已在東九省獲得一登陸據點，可由此直趨長春。北寗路已通至連山。又據軍息，錦州亦已被中央軍收復，惟尚無續報。</p>
<p>〔中央社葫蘆島廿三日電〕記者本晚抵此東北唯一之不凍港葫蘆島，市面情形尚屬良好，房屋建築完整，碼頭船塢亦均可用，島上風光，與記者於民國十九年離去時之荒凉景象均不相同。</p>
<p>〔中央社興城廿三日電〕國軍於出山海關後，十九日到達綏中，廿二日進迫興城，廿三日向錦州進發。另一部國軍，於廿二日晚進據東北不凍港之一之葫蘆島，現秦皇島與葫蘆島間，鐵道電信均已恢復。</p>
<p>〔合眾社廿五日北平電〕據東北作戰區域傳來消息，國軍可望於兩星期內攻克瀋陽，三星期內佔領長春。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿五日電〕華北美國海外部隊司令洛蓋少將，昨日來渝訪問，下楊蔣主席官邸。昨晚與主席夫婦共餐，今晨又共早餐，事畢已於今午飛入上海。臨行前曾與蔣主席舉行長談，內容雖未宣佈，但信檢討華北局勢。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕聯合國參謀團軍用航務處今日稱：中國方面美軍司令魏德邁將軍，曾在上海告記者，中國要求美國再借船隻，以便運兵至東北，關於此事，華府未予答復，但將已此事向聯合國參謀團軍用航務處請示。</p>
<h3>傳蘇方馬林諾夫斯基　向我提出三條件　撤退蘇軍一部份重回原防</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶二十五日電〕據此間某報載稱：馬林諾夫斯基將軍，向中國提出之條件如下：（一）安山煤鐵礦，由中蘇共同開採。（二）蘇聯應在松花江有通航權。（三）日偽電氣事業，吉林黑龍江金礦，及東九省主要兵工廠，歸中蘇共有共營。此間觀察家稱：若接受此項條件，東九省事實上將為中蘇共有，不復為中國領土。惟根據中蘇條約，蘇聯固承認中國在東九省有完全主權。</p>
<p>〔又電〕中共辦事處今日宣稱：蘇聯可望暫緩撤退東北駐軍，以便國軍空運至長春鐵路各要城。蘇聯此項決定，謂係出於中央政府要求。蘇聯並將設法使中國飛機在哈爾濱長春降落，惟蘇聯不願負責保護國軍在各處降落。蘇聯軍隊原定下月二日撤退，現將留駐至何時始能撤去，共黨發言人答稱不知。惟謂長春鐵路以外，蘇聯不能担保國軍以便利。蘇聯願助國軍佔領長春鐵路沿綫各城。係以中蘇條約規定兩國在該路有共同利益之故。共產黨又引「消息靈通方面」報道稱：中央政府東北接收官員將重返長春，與蘇軍外貝加爾方面司令馬林諾夫斯基重開談判。「蘇聯對中央政府態度甚為友好」，蘇軍已將日本關東軍「完全解除武裝，並予以遣散」。</p>
<p>〔合眾社重慶廿五日電〕東北來人談：以前撤退蘇軍，一部份現又回歸原防。此間接收東北官員，相當因中蘇重開談判，國軍進展甚速，彼等可望重返長春。截至日前止，國民政府赴東北官員四百四十人中，僅二人仍留駐長春，餘均撤往別處。據報告稱：熊式輝將軍到任之初，即曾設法接收長春市政府與警察局，終因受阻而未果。據云：蘇軍曾告熊氏謂，不能將市政府移交，致渠不得不返重慶請示。</p>
<h3>綏中一瞥　人民曾受日偽共黨蹂躪　物價尚稱低廉</h3>
<p>〔中央社綏中廿日電（遲到）〕記者十九日晚十一時許，到達綏中，該地人民生活，在日偽壓迫下，自屬痛苦，但物價尚稱低廉。猪肉每斤法幣廿元，牛羊肉稍廉，鷄二三百元一隻，米麥麵粉有價無貨，高梁七十元一斗，每斗合平津舊秤四十斤。在綏中日人，有一居留民會。計九二三人，以婦孺老弱為多，壯下僅七十二人。每日進高梁兩餐，按日向縣政府具領，住處非常狹隘，衣着已無一件完好。其中有願回國者，亦有不願者。當地居民受日人壓迫近十四年，近復遭受共軍騷擾，家破人亡，即有倖存者，亦鳩形鵠面，殊無人色。自綏中至錦州，有大橋三座，為共軍破壞，日內即可修復。接收工作，堪稱順利，二三日內可到錦州。</p>
<h3>南口治安已獲保障</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平二十五日電〕國軍開抵南口後，該地治安，已獲保障。由南口北至居庸關青龍橋，所謂關隘地區各重要據點，已由國軍駐紮。原駐該地區之日軍，亦經集中繳械。北平至南口九十餘里之交通，亦暢通無阻，每日往返對開火車二次，惟南口附近各鄉村，仍有共產軍盤據，騷擾地方，掠奪民間糧食財物。</p>
<h3>主席經濟方案　政院將採措施</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿五日電〕廿七日行政院開會時，將依據蔣主席廿六日對國內日下經濟狀况所作重要表示，採取措施。</p>
<h3>共產軍集結三萬餘人　圖向棗陽以北進犯　另有兩部竄魯省曹縣附近</h3>
<p>〔中央社漯河廿五日電〕（一）共軍十軍區李東潮部第三·四·七·十·十四·十五各旅共七千餘人，十九日竄魯省曹縣十五公里之仲堤附近，强徵人民車輛馬匹，似有積極企圖。（二）陷荷澤共軍，十九日竄集曹縣西北二十公里宛陵集附近，聲言將犯冀省東明。</p>
<p>〔中央社漯河廿四日電〕（一）共產軍刻結集於棗陽，桐柏一帶，共三萬五千人，其第五師師長李先念，十八日在湖陽鎮召集重要幹部六十餘人開會，商討進犯棗陽北之部灘蒼台。每股七八十人或百餘人不等，由上屯向唐河竄擾，被國軍擊退。（三）泌陽西三十里·東北二十里各處，自十八日至廿一日，先後有八百至千餘之共產軍四股竄入，顯有進犯泌陽企圖。（四）共產軍擄委之桐柏縣長安子仲，近强迫該縣　保出大麥二萬斤，或現款二萬元，並鞋襪十五雙。（五）共產軍信陽縣長萬謀初及保安團長李旭義，率部千餘十二日突向羅山進犯，情况不明。（六）信陽回望山共軍，十六日强令保民長開會，組織基幹部隊，强迫每保抽壯丁十名。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二十五日電〕軍息，濟南四郊五十里附近，共軍肆行封鎖交通，搶奪糧食物資，共軍數年來在魯境埋藏糧食甚多，今挖出已不堪食用，乃强迫民眾撤退。如查獲偽幣勒令以二十比一折換偽抗幣，發現法幣即將活埋，並用威脅手段，向民間徵兵，民眾怨聲載道，痛恨已極。</p>
<h3>東北保安司令長官部　準備隨時進駐長春　副長官梁華盛將離渝赴任</h3>

<h3>南京日軍集中營</h3>
<p>— 韓笑鵬</p>
<p>在湯山溫泉區</p>
<p>日軍繳械後，在南京和蚌埠的一部份日軍，共六千四百一十六人，都集中在南京城南七十里的湯水鎮一帶。湯水鎮就在湯山溫泉間，為南京的名勝。</p>
<p>在這裏集中的日軍，分住於四個地方，計為步兵教育隊，砲兵教育隊，下士官候補者隊，和經理部下士官候補都隊。每一隊即係敵在此設立的軍事教育機關。集中的日軍，亦以四個學校的教官學生佔大多數。四地相距十餘里，統派由敵步兵教育隊少將教官能勢雄三負責聯絡管理。我軍僅派有一六九團副營長胡德秀率步兵一連駐守。</p>
<p>這四處統名之曰：「湯水地區日本軍集中營」。</p>
<p>十一月十三日上午駐防南京的七十四年軍長施中誠將軍，特派政治部主任常健，高級參謀魏振鉞，招待我們坐汽車前往參觀。途中，對於「日軍集中營」的情形，總覺有些森嚴可怖的揣想。</p>
<p>我們的寬大</p>
<p>駐防湯水鎮的胡副營長，是一位二十二歲的廣東青年，生在新加坡，抗戰後即回祖國從軍，非常熱情。死守常德時，曾受傷。他說：「未來此受降時，本想見了日本鬼子就痛打一頓，方消心頭之恨。及至見他們一個個像綿羊一般，狼狽不堪，非常可憐，又不禁慈悲起來。日軍繳械之初，對於集中營，也是非常恐怖的，他們知道以前集中營的殘酷，很怕我們報復，後來，見到我們這樣寬大的精神，都深受感動。」</p>
<p>我們的駐軍，只擔任防務，集中營的生活，完全派能勢　三負責，實行自治。只要有臂章，可以自由上街買辦伙食。他們已深深瞭解我軍民的寬大和平的精神，知道絕不曾侮辱他或傷害他的。我們還撥給集中營一部大卡車，運送修路的日軍赴較遠的地方。</p>
<p>集中在營的官兵，吃·住都照我軍的待遇，營中生活相當不　。</p>
<p>敵繳械時，除武器彈藥等軍品外，官兵私人的東西如服裝用具等，我軍絲毫未動。他們曾把一雙新皮鞋擬送給我們一位士兵，却被拒絕了：「我們有的是，用不着你這破鞋。」</p>
<p>那些投降的日軍官，還穿着他那黃呢軍裝，和高筒皮靴。在患者收容所的內科病室外，一部鋼琴好好地擺在走廊下。我們臨行時，琴音從病室裏悠然傳來，這種集中營的生活，繳械以前的日軍，敢存這樣的希望嗎？</p>
<p>武士道精神</p>
<p>日本軍閥多年來所標榜的武士道精神，窮兵黷武，葬送了全日本的人民。現在日本投降了，日軍全部繳械，在這裏却未聞有切腹的日軍。</p>
<p>南京至湯山的公路上，日軍五隊，分段修路，看見我們的汽車來了，老遠排好了隊，恭立路旁。車過時一致恭恭敬敬地向我們敬禮，出來採買的日軍，沒有一個不站得筆挺地敬謹行禮。</p>
<p>湯水鎮日軍集中營休息所，是戰前蔣主席的別墅。能勢雄三那個矮肥傢伙，先一日奉到了通知，率領在營日兵在大門外恭迎。</p>
<p>客廳裏懸着　總理及　蔣主席像，天花板下交叉着兩行四强的國旗。</p>
<p>我們參觀各單位時，門前均有一班號兵，恭立着，吹接官號迎接。車近下士官教育隊時，有幾個日軍正在草場裏，聽見汽車聲，立刻拼命地跑到禮堂門前恭迎我們。</p>
<p>營中生活</p>
<p>敵寇對於我們和盟國的俘虜與僑民，虐待殘殺，簡直不以人來看待。投降後日軍在集中營的生活如何？</p>
<p>每人每日仍可得到米十七兩，麪八兩，肉二兩，菜十六兩。他們可以自己種菜自己出一份油印的陣中新聞</p>
<p>他們的病兵，仍可以安靜地養病，獲得充份的醫藥，病榻上用啤酒瓶插着黃菊花。每一個人的臉，都是紅潤潤的。</p>
<p>他們除了修路做工以外，不但肉體上未感受任何痛苦，精神上也未受到壓迫。</p>
<p>真能悔改嗎？</p>
<p>未參觀前，能勢雄三在禮堂裏向我們表示：「集中營的待遇很好，全體官兵都深深感激。八年來，對　蔣委員長及中國將士的偉大精神，非常欽敬。回國後，決將大中華人民的寬大厚情，帶給日本人民。」</p>
<p>步兵教育隊的牆上，貼着許多日文標語：「建設民主自由的新日本」，「消滅日本軍閥思想」。</p>
<p>陪我參觀的日軍上士翻譯官，是一個年青傢伙，他那呢子軍裝已破舊不堪，皮靴也磨破了皮，我指指皮鞋問他：「為何不換一雙？」</p>
<p>「一年未發鞋了，拿什麽換？」</p>
<p>他又指着軍裝說：「我實在討厭這種衣服了，我很喜歡換一件西服」</p>
<p>關於投降後日軍的感想，據胡副營長對我說：「大部份的官兵，對於窮兵黷武的思想，感覺錯誤，似有悔改的決心。少數軍閥的子弟，則仍很崛强。他們對於我軍的民主精神，非常詫異。辦公約時候，階級服從，絲毫不馬虎，私生活則不分彼此。團長和連長，甚至士兵，都可以在一塊打球或同席飲酒猜拳。關於這一點，他們不了解，却極羨慕。他們雖然繳了械，住在集中營裏，階級觀念仍非常深刻」。</p>
<p>歸途，在汽車上，我想：「他們果真能悔改嗎」？</p>

<p>收復區自受降以來，為時　將三月，一切施政，都在逐漸展開，青黃不接的局面，已逐漸地不再存在，走上正常的路。而在諸般設施中，關於敵偽所設學校的措置，教育當局也已定了若干原則；其辦法大致是偽方所設學校，暫予停閉，靜候處理；所有偽方學校首長，應厲行檢舉，繩以國法；任職偽方學校之教員，則須經過一番甄別；至偽方學校之學生，則一律不分科別須進教部所設立之臨時大學補習班「補習」一年。現在教部對於收復區之教育，特別是高等教育，雖有上述決定，可是因為種種關係，上海臨時大學補習班尚未開辦；以是學生失學，彷徨歧途。最近上海這些失學的學生，還組織了請願團體，呼籲復學。我們以為當局對此，宜當機立斷，迅作適當的解決。</p>
<p>論理，教育當局的措置，原則上無可非議；但在實施時究不能不顧全若干重要事實。學校一停閉，教員要甄別，而直接受到影響的便是無數青年學生。就上海　，大學臨時補習班如必將屬於各不同科系的學生，集中一地，補習一年，這不特耗費光陰，事實上且使他們與向所選習的學科脫了節，此後雖在「補習」，而就他們各自的學業言，　寗等於中斷，因此有一部份學生尚在觀望不前。况且據說補習地遲遲不開，原有各校優良教員反為其他國立大學聘請以去，而理想中的補習班教員或因交通阻滯，未必即能趕到，於是補習班的開學更無確期。這樣，青年學生目前便無書可讀了。這可能在青年學生心理上引起嚴重的影響。幸而在這一種局勢下，我們看見教育部長　家驊氏，於巡視京滬平津一帶教育之際提出很確當的口號：「學校有偽，學生無偽。」在這前提下，大概問題應可立即解決了。</p>
<p>的確，學校是有偽立的，但在偽學校裏求學的學生，決不能認為「偽學生」。這一口號，明示了我政府對處理收復區教育的基本方針。在抗戰的八年中，我政府是後移了，但大多數人民迫於環境還得滯留在他們的原居地。國家的權力，不能達到當時的淪陷區，因而有「偽學校」的產生。滯留在原居地的青年是中華民國的青年，他們祇要不甘心為敵奸作奴隸，決不因進了偽校而喪失了他們的求學權利。日下因為整理偽校的原故，致使青年學生一時失常，這在事實上也是一種不得已的現象。國家愛護青年，無分畛域，特別是在敵偽暴政下呻吟八年的收復區的青年，今日山河重光，政府對於他們的福利自更關心。現在政府對於收復區教育的措施，就是為了他們的利益。在執行政策上，也許未能如預期的理想，但相信這種局面必能改善，我們頗乘此際貢獻幾點意見。</p>
<p>第一，偽校一律停閉這政策是否得計？應該重行考慮。因為有許多偽校當初原為國立，而偽校之所以為偽，因為是它的權力取自偽組織，例如偽組織任命偽校首長，偽校首長再聘請教職員。今偽組織既不存在，偽校首長　可依處理　奸案件條例辦理。首長既去，政府另派人員接收以後，是項偽校失去其為「偽」的依據，而已不再為「偽校」。這與上海市政府之情形原可比擬。在「學校有偽，學生無偽」的口號下，似應採取改組復學辦法，使學生學業不致轉變，　　　　大致如此，京滬自可仿行。此宜輕而易舉。</p>
<p>第二，關於偽校學生集中「補習」一點，　　　　餘地。偽校　　我政府派員　　，　理上既已不再為「偽校」，若果繼續開學，各校學生自可在原校繼續肄業，只須「補習」若干額外課程即足，何必集中一地？我們覺得「補習」的確有其必要。在收復區受盡了敵偽八年暴政的青年，對於祖國堅苦抗戰的發展經過，及八年來國際局勢的推移，似已脫了節，不但偽方公立學校學生，即收復區內私立學校學生，實均有重新「補習」若干課程的必要。但此項補習應不妨碍其原有之學業；儘可一面繼續原有學業，一面進行補習。平津方面所採取者聞即係如此，則宜可同時施行於京滬。</p>
<p>第三，關於偽校教員的處理，國府既頒布有「處理漢奸案件條例」，自應只依據該條例立法本意辦理，而不宜以意為之。該條例第二條第五款規定「曾任偽組織所屬專科以上學校之校長，或重要職務者」，應厲行檢舉；同條第十款規定「敵偽管轄範圍內之文化，金融，實業，自由職業，自治或社會團體人員；憑藉敵偽勢力侵害他人，經告訴或告發者」，亦應厲行檢舉。若依第五款，則除任「校長或重要職務者」外，本不在檢舉之列，若依第十款，視為一種文化團體人員，（其實不能引用此款），亦祇限於曾經「憑藉敵偽勢力侵害他人」而又「經告訴或告發者」，方可加以摒斥。其他一般教育，在國家立法本意上，原屬未予嚴究，則偽校教員縱需甄別，為事亦屬易易，而不可遽定為概不錄用。何况那些從事自然科學的人，他們所任的課目，多與政治無關，而年來或因種種牽累，祇有忍辱負重，固守崗位，為國家在敵後教授青年以科學知識，是否負疚，亦宜重加衡量，則從寬甄別，更符為國家珍惜人才之意。</p>
<p>樹人事業，期之百年，原為國家命脈之所寄。當今河山重光，與民更生之際，尤望賢明的教育當局撫愛青年，早予復學，民族前途，國家生命，　利賴之。</p>

<h3>印度西尼亞獨立　新政府面臨試驗　此問題與太平洋各國有關</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿四日專電〕沙利領導下之新印度西尼亞政府，將於明日這遇首次嚴　試騐，蓋國民大會將開會，聆取新政府主要施政方針。此成立甫十一日之內閣，將視國會之贊成或反對而定其去留。沙利內閣係緩和份子組成，欲以放棄暴力之方法，解決獨立問題，必要時且願與荷蘭妥協，然國民大會大多數代表之意見，係「不論談判與否，吾人須堅持百分之百之獨立」。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿四日電〕印度尼西亞宣傳部長沙力佛夫吿中央社記者稱，印度尼西亞政府準備如目前與英荷當局之談判決裂後，將以印度尼西亞完全自由一案，提交國際仲裁。印度尼西亞獨立問題，包括甚多政治及經濟問題，此類問題印度尼西亞政府與荷政府間六能單獨獲得解決。此事有關太平洋全體國家，故無理由不使太平洋國家共同參加談判。荷蘭政府之策略，在與印度尼西亞人作單獨談判，而不欲使其他國家參與，此不但對吾人爲不公允，即對其他太平洋國家亦這不公允之事。印度尼西亞政府完全準備接受國際代表團實地調查情形，以掃除由此間傳出各種錯誤之報吿。吾人特別歡迎中國政府之代表前來調查眞象。</p>
<p>任何統治方式表示決不接受</p>
<p>〔中央社記者伍乾滋巴達維亞廿四日電〕印度尼西亞宣傳部長沙力佛夫對記者稱：印度尼西亞於其獨立鬥爭中，不擬藉外力援助，但對印度尼西亞並無領土及經濟需求而援助，自所歡迎。吾人正爲確實而毫無缺陷之獨立而作戰，已非荷人堅持一再談判之主權問題。問題乃在目前之政府是否爲印度尼西亞事實上之政府。荷蘭任何形式之統治決不接受，倘荷蘭强欲以武力，重行統治印度尼西亞，即將不斷發生革命，世人當認清此點。</p>

<h3>劃朝鮮為兩軍區　金九表示反對　暫不要求他國承認新政府</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢城廿三日合衆電〕金九氏返漢城後稱：余目前不致要求他國承認韓國臨時政府，但余日後或將提此要求。余目前係以私人之資格來此，極盼與各黨領袖會談。各政黨之團結爲達到獨鮮獨立之第一步，渠料蘇美分割朝鮮之局面，當可早期停止。記者詢以朝鮮是否可能成爲共產主義國家。答稱：目前尙不能斷言，余係相信民主方式之政府者。美駐朝鮮軍司令霍奇鄭重指出，全九氏之返刺鮮，非即軍政府即已承認其臨時政府也。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢城廿三日專電〕朝鮮臨時政府主席金九抵此後，中央社記者即往訪問，渠劈頭即稱：「余不願見朝鮮被劃成二各別之軍事區。」此位六十九歲高齡之朝鮮獨立遝動領袖，認爲此種分裂局面，不久即將取消，蓋渠深信美蘇兩國均將爲朝鮮作合理之事。金氏續稱：目前不擬請各國承認朝鮮臨時政府，但將來渠或將請求之。目前金氏及其領導下之臨時政府人員，均以平民資格返國。</p>
<p>各黨領袖趨向團結</p>
<p>〔中央社記者曾恩波漢城廿四日電〕記者頃走訪朝鮮國民黨主席安朝洪（　音）詢其對金九之印象。　　。不對金九之力能使各黨派獲得團結一致，有完全信心。安氏切實提出保證，謂余之政黨已對金九表示擁獲，以後仍當繼續支持合氏。此位國民黨領袖對金九流亡國外奮鬥四十年之後，今以平民資格返國一點，表示遺憾。記者後又趨訪左眞人民黨主席劉鴻雲（譯音），據談，渠信金九之返國，將使各政黨趨於團結。</p>
<p>美僑行動迄未一致</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約約時報今日發蘇兩國在朝鮮未能行動一致，實屬遺憾。其言曰，美蘇兩國現在朝鮮發生直接關係，如雙方意見確係一致，且均願對亞洲前途共負責任，正可於朝鮮獲得一表現之機會。但吾人迄未見兩國有任何合作之象徴，甚且兩國政府並禾公開相商。國務院似以朝鮮問題爲無足輕重，認爲屆時自有解決辦法，吾人未敢贊同。朝鮮日軍業經遣送返國，美蘇當局仍不思計劃將佔頌軍撤退，而繼續使朝鮮領土割裂爲二，不知有何理由。一九零五年吾人因放縱日本而陷朝鮮於不利，今應痛改前非，使朝鮮有復興機會。</p>

<p>— 張叔英</p>
<p>檳城鍾靈中學，夙負盛譽，目爲南洋最高學府，歷史悠久，規模宏大，其設備之美備，尤爲英荷屬及暹緬各華校冠。戰前有敎職員六十餘人，學生近二工人，師生間雍融和悅如一家人。九一八以後，領導僑胞努力於救國工作。</p>
<p>不幸民國三十年十二月八日，晴天霹靂，日寇南侵，消息傳來，人心惶惶，不旋踵而素稱「東方花園」之檳榔嶼，已在敵機濫炸中，血肉橫飛，屍體狼籍，鬧市頓成死市。同月十六日，日寇登陸，檳城僑胞從此淪於暗無天日之活地獄，而鍾中師生，亦陷入絕境。茲略述其蒙難情形如次：</p>
<p>當日寇準備南侵之際，早有特工人員網布谷地，鍾中師生平時之領導救國工作，已爲日寇洞悉。登陸之日，日寇故不聲張。直至翌年春，敵憲開始搜索，由新加坡漸及北馬。迨四月初，檳城被檢，鍾中即這其主要目標。一頁慘痛之血史，就此開端。時鍾中敎職員已多先期離檳，惟尙有十一人留校，一日深夜，悉被圍捕入獄，灌水，炙燭，上電，飼狗，釘手足……濫施毒刑，慘絕人實。結果，不屈而死者，有李詞傭·管亮工·朱宣儀·柯粹桐·林振凱·簡德　等六烈士。其餘五人拘禁三月餘始釋。查企唐出獄後，以傷重，昏倒途中而死，饒百迎不久亦吿不治，僅王世毅·黃峇福·梅英榮三人，得回家調養，重慶更生。全校學生及工役被捕者，亦達數百人，而死者農及其半。殘暴日寇，竟將鍾中師生一網打盡，而校具亦毀切一空，以洩歡憤，言之痛心！</p>
<p>今者，暴敵屈伏，天日重光，秩序漸復舊觀，而鍾靈中學亦從事修葺校舍，定本年十二月八日正式復校開學。回憶四年前之同日，正暴敵南侵之時，予任鍾中秘書職，僅以身免，痛定思痛，淚涔涔下也，是以記之。</p>
<h3>審判戰犯的法律根據</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十五日電〕紐倫堡會審納粹領袖，已引起法津上之重要問題，若干國際法學者，然對於紐倫堡之範圍雖廣，然對於紐倫堡諸被吿之罪行，並無懲罰之判例及規定。國際法包含習慣法及成文法，紐倫堡各被吿即係因彼等所從事之壓迫，非刑，大屠殺，宗敎，政治及種族性之排斥以及集體財產之沒收等等行為，有違人道及善心之原則，可予以控訴，須知此等行為，乃非國家合法之行動，向他國伸展其統治勢力，各被吿在開始其政治事業之初，即具有危害和平之惡意。然破　和平，能否即視為違背國際法之行爲，據一九二八年之凱浴格白里安非戰公約所規定，戰爭不得被認爲國家政策之工具。而納粹陰謀之最後目標，即係為該公約所否認之工具—戰爭，且其作戰之方法，又與陸海戰規約大相違背，而在戰爭發動之前，亦曾一再推翻已所訂定之國際協定及已所提出之保證，即最淺顯之「一國不得干涉他國國內事件」之義務，亦不予履行。自凡爾賽和的以至德蘇互不侵犯條約，悉爲其摧毀餘。查戰犯法庭之設立及該法庭所援用之法律原則，係以二國際條約爲據，其一爲英美蘇於一九四三年十一月在莫斯科發表之宣言，申明重要戰犯將由協的國政府共同議決予以懲戒，其二爲英獎蘇法於一九四五年八月八日在倫敦簽訂之協定，議定設立法庭並制定約章。</p>

<h3>帳面資本金額之整理</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>工商企業界，近因僞中儲券之收兌，帳面不宜仍以僞券記載金額，紛紛整理帳目，而其資本金額究應如何拆合或換算，却未有相當標準，會計師公會及市商會之工商法規研究委員會，正在討論此問題，本報承各方寄文，有所論列，爰分日發表，以爲工商業之一助。（記者）</p>
<p>自抗戰勝利，收復區百端待理，而工商企業之整理，最先引起吾人之焦慮者，即爲資本金額之調整問題，蓋戰亂八年，事業組織及通貨情形，已失常軌，會計制度，亦從而牽强掩飾，非復正常原理所可範圍，若不再急起直追，普遍整理，其何以繼往而開來，資本金額，原爲會計處理上所首應決定之問題，則其値得焦慮，凡屬研究會計者暨從事企業者，甚至制作法令，執行政策，以及指導各業者，當與有同感也，本市會計師公會及商會，已分別設置專門會議及工商法規研究會，詳討其事，全市企業界正密切注意此一問題之發展，作者早歲研究會計，近年從事工商業，切身之所感受，尤爲深切，歷承各方諮詢，愧無切實易行之辦法買獻於社會，然茲有一事敢向各方提醒者，即</p>
<p>資本之眞詮　詮乃為資產減去負債之餘，斷非代表資本主出資之現在貨幣，申言之，即資本之帳面金額，乃係資本主純資產之抽象數目，並非如一般資產負債之另有其獨立之形體也，至於帳面資本金額與純資產時值之往往不能相稱，且可說終覺不能相稱，則係會計上估價方針及經營上『打底子』方針之所係，與資本全額之本身無與也，例如資本主出資一百萬元，以經營工廠，其原來之出資，爲黨時之通行貨幣。泊乎經營開始，則國定資產之設備也，原料之購進也，人工開支之支付也，銷貨之收入也，銀行錢莊資金之往來也，生生不已，變化無窮。在會計上早已從收入資本一百萬元之一個交易行爲，變化爲其他之各種交易行爲。雖帳面資本金額仍爲此一百萬元，而事實上資產減負債後所餘之純資產，却早已與此不符，且可以說時時刻刻在發生與此不符之變化。此不符之結果，或爲盈或爲虧，原無定程。出資者及經營者如願常常辦理決算，結出盈虧，將其帳面資本金額按增資減資之手續加以調整，可也，或延不決算（當然不可超過一個會計年度），及決算時故意將盈虧拖匿，或將虧損掛宕虛彌，使帳面資本金額一無變化，或變化少些，亦可也，總之，帳面資本金額之不能盡符資本主科目下所應得之純資產時值，爲會計上及經營上之技術乃至政策問題，而此資本金額之非資本主現存貨幣之金額，則斷斷無疑，夫如此，吾人乃可以</p>
<p>二百作一計算　之乎，此二百作一，乃中央政府憫收復區民間流通僞中儲券受累之可痛，始定此比率，命令國家金融機關收兌，以了此一筆帳，非謂一般債權債務，必須流通如此比率淸理也，更非謂資本主之資本金頫，亦須照此此率折合也，且中央政府整理收復區僞券，似亦有變通之法，觀於僞聯準券之折合率，更可了然，今之談資本金額整理問題者，乃斤於二百作一之標準，抑不知資本並非現金，並非資本主現存之僞中儲券也，吾人若從會計學理上言之，資產減負債等於資本，其方程式原係平衡的，通俗言之。帳面上各種帳目之收付總和，原屬『軋得平』，如欲施以換算，祇須比串相等，其收付兩方之總和仍屬相等，而此項財產再經收付交易所發生增減變化之結果，仍屬資本主之所有，似無多大之出入也，惟從事業經營及現行法令上言之，則頗有問題矣，例如以資產帳面金融折低，此資產發生交易時，必有更多之帳面盈餘，於是勞資分紅問題也，稅收機關征收問題也，資本主將受不合理之損失，反之如將資產帳面金額抬高，則資本主已將未實現之盈餘掩飾地轉入資本，人將視爲剝奪勞工紅利，逃避國家稅收，胥非吾人之所願聞，愚以爲資本之帳面金額，可按照各家實際情形，在不損害勞工紅利及不逃避國家稅收之範圍內，酌量加以提高，以不超過仍保留現在之帳面金額平掉爲法幣額爲止，凡負債之可按二百作一率償還者，自可照折，而固定資產中則不妨擇其與時値相差殊甚者，的略提升，俾帳面資本金額仍得照原額或接近原額以法幣記載照近年。（未完）</p>

<h3>美麗的鏡頭</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>十一月二十二日，美聯社發出一條電訊，描繪了一個美麗絕倫的鏡頭。可惜這條電訊許多中文報都忽略了，以致多數讀者都沒有機會讀到。</p>
<p>這則電訊是從美國海軍港珊璧特羅發出的，內容說：『美國第三艦隊司令綽號『野牛』的海雷賽，悲傷地結束了他的海軍事業，他說：「我失去了我的右手。」海軍上將海雷賽在美艦南達科太號上拉下了四顆星的海軍上將旗，把司令權移交給金曼海軍上將。金曼上將盛讚海雷賽的功勳，並說他結束了海軍史上一段最光榮的事業。行禮時艦上全體海軍官兵二千人立正致敬。』</p>
<p>這段短短的電訊，在美國也許很平常，可是在我們中國老百姓的眼光中，這好像是一個極樂世界中的事。因爲在人家的國家裏，軍隊國家化已經是不成問題的事了。整隊的海陸空軍，可以不流滴血不費一彈地從一位將領的手中移交給另外一位將領，大家都是在爲國効勞，毫無異詞。可是這在我們中國，還是少見的事。</p>
<p>要使中國眞正成爲一個像樣的現代化國家，軍隊必須國家化，而不是個人或黨派的私產和工具。當海雷賽退職這一類的景象出現在中國的時候，中國才能走上民主之路。</p>
<h3>浪子</h3>
<p>— 雷文</p>
<p>浪子，流浪在山野江湖間，鞋底被磨穿，臉上塗滿泥垢，在這不曾相識的人海中翻過多少筋斗，看過多少希奇古怪冷漠的面孔。於是：他倦了。他想起家庭的溫暖，願意回到父親的懷抱去。</p>
<p>正如聖經上的記載，浪子在路上做了許多許多的夢。他夢見他回來了，父親站在門口迎接，他跑過去，跪在父親的膝下，吻着他的脚，老人把鮮花織成的帽子戴在浪子的頭上，用翡翠的的指爲他視福，吩咐庖丁殺豬宰羊，準備好美酒，這一天，把榮耀歸給浪子。</p>
<p>浪子走在回家的路上，天正落着大雪，單薄綻開的衣服遮不住寒冷，遠方有飆風吹過，他憶念起母親，夢見一件織錦縫成的袍子裏在身上，母親溫煦的眼光帶來適意的蘇醒。</p>
<p>他帶看一個美麗的夢往回家的路上走，一點點家庭中溫融的氣息逗引着，前面像一片坦曠的平原，樹木含着青翠，豐滿的果子成熟在枝頭上，鳳凰和孔雀在空中飛翔，小河中有鴛鴦撲閃着翅膀。</p>
<p>忘記被遺棄了的磨難，讓雪水滲進透穿了的鞋底，冷風罩進綻開的破衣，浪子不再感到痛苦，家鄕在向自己招手。</p>
<p>一天，陰沉的夜晚，在叢林間，浪子望見老家窗戶上的燈光，血液裏穿過一陣快樂的顫抖，像全身得到了驟然的解放，他用着疾速的步子衝過去，衝到老屋的牆角，他怔住了：</p>
<p>廢園中母親的墓木已拱，父親睏在床上，喘息着殘餘了的晚年，沒有了牛羊羣的棚廄瞪着一雙怪眼望着峭冷的鉛空，奴僕們的臥室也都坍毀。</p>
<p>在那沒落了的客堂中，大哥揪着二哥的耳朶大聲的喊：</p>
<p>『屬於浪子的一部分財產應該歸我執管！』</p>
<p>父親由敗壞了的木床上掙扎起殘軀，衰弱地申斥；</p>
<p>『須留着，我還沒有死！』</p>
<p>但燭光已經燃盡，朽木已不能支持巨厦，老人頹倒在床上，大地裂開了。</p>
<p>浪子衰頹地立在牆角，像一隻鬥敗了的公鷄，寒冷包裏住身體，一切都是肅殺的悲哀，他迂緩地轉過身，走向歸來時的去路。</p>
<p>雪地上印下浪子的脚跡，一個個深沉而巨大的脚跡。</p>

<h3>想起我們的文化人</h3>
<p>— 子芒</p>
<p>讀到些陪都文化人生活的消息，能不黯然神傷呢？—有着詩人臥在病床生着嚴重的肺癆，有着著名的學者在賣舊書度日，而大部份的作家生活更獲不到安定，沒有溫暖，於是也談不到精神事業的發展了。</p>
<p>本來，作家貢獻的是精神食糧，但也需要精神的安慰。但老作家歷年的耕耘和生產得到的，僅梵同情的嘆息，而最多的還是輕蔑，並且不爲社會人士所重視—這說來，想到我們的有些通訊社，從來不大肯爲一個名作家發些新作和行踪的消息，也想到我們的出版家，更少與文化人精誠合作，只是把作家當機器，沒有休養的時候，甚至連修養的時間也彼加速度的生產壓力所剝削了。</p>
<p>這又不覺想到外國作家的待遇，政府不但給他們最大的榮譽，也給他們舒適的生活，而一個作家的行踪，新聞記者們視爲與一個政府要人同樣重要，無怪他們會有優秀的作品，不過在此對於我們的一些喘息於生活重祖下而還貢獻心力的文化人，更有着千倍的敬意。</p>
<p>但由此，我們　得對文化人的獎勵，是刻不容緩的。雖有兩三文化人得到勝利勳章之類，我覺得應該更普遍的發給。而政府方面對於文化人的生活，和出版自由，也應加以保障，對於一切文化進展的阻礙，應予剷除。並且爲了取得與文化人之密切聯絡，不妨經常舉行座談會，建設作家文物博物館。假使是一個報吿文學的作者，處處要予以章旅免費的優待，和觀察的便利。</p>
<p>這些，在政府方面是輕而易舉的，在文化人方面則受惠不淺，而於民間知識份子的影響更是很大。</p>
<p>編者按：中央文化運動委員會主任委員張道落先生來滬之後，文化界曾舉行歡迎會，張先生並定於本月二十七日再度請文化界人士茶會。希望以後這類的聚會以及其他的座談會能隨時舉行，使文化界對於切身的問題，有個交換意見的機會。</p>
<h3>巴東夜泊</h3>
<p>— 宋牧</p>
<p>船停在巴東的時候，已是薄暮時分，江面上飄起一層自茫茫的霧，遠遠近近起伏的山巒伏在黑暗裏。</p>
<p>甲板上亂哄哄地走着人，茶房大聲地吆喝着，圍看船舷，聚攏起好些舢板，男人家，女人家絆着繩索就擄起袖子拚命朝上爬。舢板在激流中跳上跳下像翻着筋斗。</p>
<p>那個左眼角有一塊黃疤的水乎，早已打扮得齊齊整整，一身藍布褂褲，漿洗得挺挺地，頭髮上想是搽了香水，打人前走過，給帶米一陣濃郁的氣息。他警見我，於是朝我的肘上輕輕觸了一下，吐着舌頭。</p>
<p>『喂，不上岸去開開眼啊！』</p>
<p>我隨着他上了岸，從碼頭到市街有一段很長的石級。我記不淸走了多久，祗是覺得爬到頂上的時候，也早累得滿臉汗涔涔的了。</p>
<p>市街上很明亮，舖子的門口都高懸着油燈，攤販特別多，他們也許是　着道班航船專門做夜市來的，大聲地招呼着過往的行人。船上下來的人都一堆堆給他們吸引住了。有坐在沿街的麵飾喪吃起霄夜來，牛肉的芬香勾得人胃口饞說地，也有的摩安着一些小古玩，翻閱古老的唱本。</p>
<p>這是鄂西一個很小的縣份，實際上主要的街道祗有一條，化個幾分鐘就能走完。但因爲它是川鄂水道的樞紐，所以平常市面相當繁榮，四川的桐油豬鬃很多在這兒轉口，在水漲的時候，上下流航船常是連綿不絕地經過這裏。</p>
<p>我們在一　　　角的時候，我的那個打扮　　　的水手朋友　什麼聲音吸引　了，我掉　頭可以　是那　一個穿緊身褂子的女人，挽着圓圓的　，爲生髮油抹得亮光光地，我的水手朋友一張平板的臉也跟着顯得煥發起來，他嘻嘻地那女人做着鬼臉，又向着我。</p>
<p>『喂，她在招呼我呢？你不進去暍一杯茶，我讓她給你找一個小巧的……』</p>
<p>那女人的臉似乎漾起一層紅，我搖着頭，等我再一轉眼，我的水手朋友早已樓着那女人鑽到吊脚樓裏去了。</p>
<p>我疲倦地返到船上，江面上的霧更濃了些，船艙裏有人哼京戲，這已是夜深了，四周的舢板上有女人啞着喉嚨喊：</p>
<p>『賣黃菓啊：賣黃菓啊？』</p>
<p>那聲音聽起來却有着無限蒼老，凄凉。</p>
<h3>天才和苦工</h3>
<p>— 樹揆</p>
<p>我常常碰到一些年靑人，他們常常以爲自己很聰明，書只要讀一遍；隨便什麼事情，做起來都很容易。</p>
<p>但我問問他讀過的書，他却說不出書中的要義，所做的事時都不十分高明。</p>
<p>這是爲什麼？這是自以為天十無「難」事，自己是個總明人，其實他是中了『天才毒』的天字第一號的懶惰蟲。</p>
<p>安迪生說！『事業的成功百分之九十九是苦工，百分之一是天才』。</p>
<p>顏回和子路並不聰明，傳孔子之道的，却是他們，這是因爲他們有用苦工。</p>
<p>誰都知道莫泊桑是法國的短篇小說之王，但開始寫小說的，候，聽從老師福羅貝爾的敎訓，先描寫了一百個人的不同的面貌。</p>
<p>歐克賽是愛爾蘭的新派戲劇家，但他開始寫的入部戲劇，都被愛貝劇院拒絕。不過他並不灰心，接受別人的指敎，到頭來終究成功。</p>
<p>寫實主義小說中最傑出的天才是巴爾札克，他在自叙傳中說：『我是常以每天十四小時的苦工業寫我的小說，而只吃一些開水和白麵包』</p>
<p>龜兎賽跑的故事，不單是小學生的敎材，應該使每一個人，都由此猛醒。</p>
<p>『拳不離手，曲不離口』；一個音樂家，也每天練習着樂器，畫家是不與他的畫筆和調色板分開的。我要吿訴年靑人，事業的成功，學業的完成，不全靠天才，而在不斷地勞苦的習作。</p>
<p>『只要功夫深，鐵杵磨成針』。該是我們爲學的最好的座右銘。我的能够寫出這篇簡短的小文，是我勤讀十年的結果。</p>
<h3>寓敎育於娛樂？</h3>
<p>— 孫嘉</p>
<p>在上海，有些不學生躲在媽媽懷裏，在馬雀檯旁學習中發白生字，也有些大學生聚賭牌九，研究數學的變化，令人感到洋塲上直是大規模地在推行着『寓敎育於娛樂』的運動啦！</p>
<h3>浪費</h3>
<p>— 葭水</p>
<p>十一月十七日大陸報有載，北平的四所僞國立大學與專科學校，共有學生五千，和一半數目的敎師與行政人員。</p>
<p>這就是說，有敎職員二千五百人。也就是說，平均每學生兩人，便分派到敎員或職員一人。</p>
<p>怎麼用得着這許多？</p>
<p>記得，在戰前，敎部曾派員視察各地公私立大學，回去作了詳細的報吿。其中述及某私立大學頗知節省，職員極少，而辦事效率極佳；歷年賬目淸楚明白，從不欠債。而某大學冗員極多，職員人數與敎員人數相等，所耗費的薪　亦相等，成為一項龐大的支出，是虛經了的。</p>
<p>這都是浪費。</p>
<p>『人類的故事』的作者房　在「聖經的故事」序中說，他所不能容忍者有二，其一就是浪費</p>
<p>然而中國，窮雖窮，浪費之事正多着。豈獨戰前，豈獨僞政府時？就如今，仍是看得見金錢的浪費，人力的浪費，生命的浪費。</p>
<p>比如有的學校停頓着，有的工廠接收了而不開工，有許多錢都花費在裝點門面上，這都是一種浪費，我們希望各種工作都能上軌道，浪費的現象由能減少而至消滅。</p>
<h3>古劍可貴</h3>
<p>— 黃文錦</p>
<p>一個朋友隔着重洋，從充滿着異國情調的地方寄來封信。他說，在隔膜的人羣中，一個流浪者是多麼依戀他的故友啊！聽講遇到疑難的問題，想找尋一個親切的朋友來叩索解答；可是，舉目四望却彷彿是航洋的水手，在海船上孤獨地對着大海，死寂，寒冷，簡直痛苦得要瘋狂了。</p>
<p>的確，久處在一羣熟悉快樂的朋友中，終日相嬉嬉，我們是不容易覺得友情的可貴的。這正如都市中用慣了電燈的人，不會感到電燈的明亮。但是，當離開了那親密的氣氛，而走進一個新的，不能融洽的環境裏，在心底深處便立刻會染上一縷寂寞的情緒了。</p>
<p>有人說，誠實的朋友猶如可恃的他康，雖然我們或者不會失去他，然而，在保有他時，很少有人會深感他的價値。不過，等到需要他帮助的時候，才知道舊友古劍是生活中最可信賴的事物了。我想誰也不會否認這句話吧。</p>
<p>所以，任何人處身於社會中，總該絕不厭煩地盡力去尋找正直的朋友，由親密的，推廣到疏生的，讓朋友給我們介紹朋友，以符合人類相依的本則。</p>
<h3>情感的力量</h3>
<p>— 祝敔</p>
<p>剛敎完學生們『沙漠中的情感』（巴爾札克作的一篇小說），而學生們好像不很懂得它裏面的含意。故事是說：一個逃脫的法國俘處流落在埃及的沙漠裘，突與一豹相遇；他千方百計愛撫這猛獸，用最大的情感去敎育它，臺服它；後來，他竟與豹結了無形的友誼，這荒凉的沙漢也變成一個小的大堂了，意義在那裏？</p>
<p>馬洛說過：『地以不是另外一個地力，就是我們的世界』。我們人間怎麼會是地獄？請想想：我們一生中用過多少溫暖的悄感？我們常常套上冷酷的面孔，以尖銳的指爪，奪取於己有利的事物，置他人不顧，人人這樣，一世上便失去了友愛同情，互助，諒解，留着的是自私，貪婪，掠奪，衝突——這不是地獄是什麼？我們要再建我們的天堂，唯有大家遍施情感的春風。</p>
<p>人不是天生善，也不是天生惡，却是素白的一塊，這就是上帝所賦的情感，有無上的寳貴，怎可把它失落？</p>
<p>這是眞理，改造環境不是伴什麼大事業只要人以素性相待，以眞情換虛僞，以摯情換惡意，人與人的距離使會縮短，人與人的溫度便會和暖了。先建立我們各人心上的火堂，地上的天堂馬上出現了。</p>
<p>地球將歸毀滅，假使情感一旦消失！</p>
<p>一切罪惡的行爲都能以情感化之，即使無靈性的豹也受到它的感動，何况人？壓迫徒然。各展眞悄，各自諒解，各歸和洽。</p>
<h3>烙印</h3>
<p>— 寄望</p>
<p>一個烙印，深深地打在我心底深處。</p>
<p>恥辱，創傷，忿怒和仇恨，這永遠磨滅不掉的痕印。</p>
<p>受過無人道的毒打，灌過水，錄過口供，被迫寫過悔過書，捺過手印，在人間活地獄裏任憑擺佈，侮辱，失掉了反抗的性能，我簡直像是一個活的死人，被關上幾天，然後再把你釋放。</p>
<p>今天，居然是大國民了。大國民應有的態度據說是寬恕，容忍，往者不追，這是我們大國民的美德。唉！這是大國民的悲哀！</p>
<p>讓這個烙印永遠地銘刻在心底深處吧！</p>
<p>這是沉寃。</p>
<p>這是大國民的悲哀。</p>

<p>— 賽珍珠著　朱綺譯</p>
<p>商定之後，兩人就將這人抬了起來。他輕得很，正像一隻餓了很久的雞，祇剩了毛和骨頭架子。他們將他抬着，他的手向下　着，抬上了有階，抬進了屋子的邊門。進門是一條走廊，走完了走廊，他們將他抬進了一間空着的臥室。這原是貞雄的父親的臥室，自從他去世以後，就一直空着不用。他們放他在那舖着厚厚的席子的地上臥着。這間房裏的一切東西，都是日本式的，因爲那位老太爺生前是從來不肯坐椅子，或睡在一張外國式的床上的。花子從壁樹裘拿出一床軟軟的棉被來。她猶豫着，這是一條花綢面子的被，有潔白的綢裏子。</p>
<p>她恨恨地輕聲說逍：『他眞髒。』</p>
<p>貞雄也說：『是的，最好先給他洗個澡。你去拿熱水來，我來替他洗。』</p>
<p>她說：『你可別去碰他。我們先要吿訴傭人們他在這裏。我現在去吿訴弓子。她可以離開孩子們一會兒，來替他洗一洗。』</p>
<p>貞雄想了一想說：『好的、你去吿訴弓子，我去告訴別的俯人。』</p>
<p>可是這人不省人事的臉上的蒼自的顏色，引得他先俯身下去按着他的脈搏。脈搏雖弱，可是仍在跳動。他再將手按在這人的冰冷的胸口。心也還在跳。</p>
<p>貞雄沉吟着說：『要是不給他施行手術的話，他可要死了，只不知他這樣一來可會死去。』</p>
<p>它子怕等呌了起來。『不要救地！他活了又怎樣？』</p>
<p>貞雄道：『他死了又怎樣？』他站着看住那個一動都不動的人。這人一定有着超人的生活力，吾則他現在就要死了。他還很年輕呢——也許還不到二十五歲</p>

        <h1>1945.11.26</h1>
<h3>Both Huludao and Jinzhou Recaptured; Shenyang and Changchun Expected to Fall Within Two or Three Weeks; Major General Locke Returned to Shanghai Yesterday from Chongqing</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] According to the "Today's News" here, the Central Army recaptured Huludao at midnight on Thursday. The equipment in the port was only slightly damaged. This means that the Central Army has gained a landing point in the Nine Eastern Provinces and can proceed directly to Changchun. The Beining Railway has been cleared to Lianshan. Military sources also indicate that Jinzhou has also been recaptured by the Central Army, but there are no further reports.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huludao, 23rd] This reporter arrived tonight at Huludao, the only ice-free port in the Northeast. The city is in good condition, the buildings are intact, and the docks and shipyards are all usable. The scenery on the island is very different from the desolate scene when this reporter left in 1930.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xingcheng, 23rd] After passing through Shanhaiguan, the National Army arrived in Suizhong on the 19th, pressed on to Xingcheng on the 22nd, and advanced towards Jinzhou on the 23rd. Another unit of the National Army seized Huludao, one of the ice-free ports in the Northeast, on the evening of the 22nd. Railway and telecommunications between Qinhuangdao and Huludao have now been restored.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beijing, 25th] According to news from the Northeast war zone, the National Army is expected to capture Shenyang within two weeks and occupy Changchun within three weeks.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] Major General Locke, Commander of the US Overseas Forces in North China, visited Chongqing yesterday and stayed at Chairman Chiang's official residence. He dined with Chairman and Madame Chiang last night and had breakfast with them this morning. He flew to Shanghai this afternoon. Before leaving, he had a long talk with Chairman Chiang. Although the contents were not announced, it is believed to have been a review of the situation in North China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] The Military Air Transport Division of the United Nations Staff Delegation stated today: General Wedemeyer, Commander of the US Forces in China, told reporters in Shanghai that China has requested the United States to lend more ships to transport troops to the Northeast. Washington has not responded to this request but has referred it to the Military Air Transport Division of the United Nations Staff Delegation for instructions.</p>
<h3>Rumor: Soviet Malinowski Presents Three Conditions to Us; Partial Withdrawal of Soviet Troops to Original Defenses</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] According to a newspaper here, General Malinowski has proposed the following conditions to China: (1) The Anshan coal and iron mine should be jointly developed by China and the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union should have navigation rights on the Songhua River. (3) The electrical industries of the Japanese puppet regime, the Jilin and Heilongjiang gold mines, and the main arsenals in the Nine Eastern Provinces should be jointly owned and operated by China and the Soviet Union. Observers here say that if these conditions are accepted, the Nine Eastern Provinces will in fact be jointly owned by China and the Soviet Union and will no longer be Chinese territory. However, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union recognizes China's complete sovereignty over the Nine Eastern Provinces.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Communist Party Office announced today that the Soviet Union is expected to temporarily postpone the withdrawal of troops stationed in the Northeast to facilitate the airlift of National Army troops to key railway cities in Changchun. This Soviet decision is said to be at the request of the Central Government. The Soviet Union will also try to enable Chinese aircraft to land in Harbin and Changchun, but the Soviet Union is unwilling to be responsible for protecting the National Army landing in various places. The Soviet troops were originally scheduled to withdraw on the 2nd of next month, and the Communist Party spokesman said he did not know when they would withdraw. However, he said that the Soviet Union could not guarantee the convenience of the National Army outside the Changchun Railway. The Soviet Union is willing to help the National Army occupy the cities along the Changchun Railway because the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that the two countries have common interests in the railway. The Communist Party also cited "well-informed sources" reporting that the Central Government's Northeast receiving officials will return to Changchun to reopen negotiations with Marshal Malinowski, commander of the Soviet Transbaikal Front. "The Soviet Union's attitude towards the Central Government is very friendly," and the Soviet army has "completely disarmed and dismissed" the Japanese Kwantung Army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] People from the Northeast said that some of the Soviet troops who had previously withdrawn have now returned to their original defenses. The officials receiving the Northeast here are quite optimistic that with the reopening of Sino-Soviet negotiations and the rapid progress of the National Army, they can expect to return to Changchun. As of yesterday, only two of the 440 officials of the National Government who went to the Northeast remained in Changchun, and the rest had withdrawn to other places. According to reports, General Xiong Shihui attempted to take over the Changchun Municipal Government and police station when he first took office but was unsuccessful due to obstruction. It is said that the Soviet army told Xiong that it could not hand over the municipal government, forcing him to return to Chongqing for instructions.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Suizhong: The People Have Suffered Under the Japanese Puppet Regime and the Communist Party; Prices Are Still Relatively Low</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suizhong, 20th (Delayed)] This reporter arrived in Suizhong at about 11 pm on the 19th. The lives of the people in the area were undoubtedly miserable under the oppression of the Japanese puppet regime, but prices are still relatively low. Pork is 20 yuan per catty in legal tender, beef and mutton are slightly cheaper, chickens are 200-300 yuan each, rice, wheat, and flour are priced but unavailable, and sorghum is 70 yuan per dou, each dou equivalent to 40 catties of the old Tianjin and Beijing standard. There is a Japanese residents association in Suizhong, with 923 people, mostly women, children, and the elderly, with only 72 strong men. They receive two meals of sorghum per day, which they collect daily from the county government. Their accommodations are very cramped, and none of their clothing is intact. Some want to return to their country, while others do not. The local residents have been oppressed by the Japanese for nearly 14 years and have recently been harassed by the Communist army, leading to broken homes and deaths. Even those who have survived are emaciated and inhuman. There are three large bridges between Suizhong and Jinzhou, which were destroyed by the Communist army and can be repaired within days. The reception work is proceeding smoothly, and we can reach Jinzhou in two or three days.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prisoner-of-War Camp in Nanjing</h3>
<p>— Han Xiaopeng</p>
<p>In the Tangshan Hot Spring Area</p>
<p>After the Japanese army surrendered, a part of the Japanese army in Nanjing and Bengbu, a total of 6,416 people, were concentrated in the Tangshui Town area, 70 miles south of Nanjing City. Tangshui Town is located in the Tangshan Hot Springs, a famous scenic spot in Nanjing.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops concentrated here are housed in four places, namely the Infantry Education Team, the Artillery Education Team, the Non-Commissioned Officer Candidate Team, and the Logistics Department Non-Commissioned Officer Candidate Team. Each team is a military education institution established by the enemy here. The concentrated Japanese troops are mostly instructors and students from the four schools. The four locations are more than ten miles apart, and Nōse Yūzō, a major general instructor of the enemy infantry education team, is responsible for liaison and management. Our army has only sent a company of infantry led by Hu Dexiu, deputy battalion commander of the 169th Regiment, to garrison.</p>
<p>The four locations are collectively called: "Tangshui Area Japanese Military Concentration Camp".</p>
<p>On the morning of November 13th, General Shi Zhongcheng, commander of the 74th Army stationed in Nanjing, specially sent Chang Jian, director of the Political Department, and Wei Zhenyue, a senior staff officer, to invite us to take a car to visit. Along the way, I felt some solemn and terrifying assumptions about the situation of the "Japanese Military Concentration Camp."</p>
<p>Our Magnanimity</p>
<p>Deputy Battalion Commander Hu, who is stationed in Tangshui Town, is a 22-year-old young man from Guangdong, who was born in Singapore. After the War of Resistance, he returned to his motherland to join the army and is very enthusiastic. He was wounded when he defended Changde to the death. He said: "When I came here to accept the surrender, I wanted to beat the Japanese devils severely when I saw them, to dispel the hatred in my heart. But when I saw them all like sheep, embarrassed and miserable, I couldn't help but feel compassion. At the beginning of the Japanese army's surrender, they were also very terrified of the concentration camp. They knew the cruelty of the concentration camps in the past and were very afraid of our retaliation. Later, when they saw our spirit of such magnanimity, they were deeply moved."</p>
<p>Our garrison is only responsible for defense. Nōse Yūzō is fully responsible for the life in the concentration camp and implements self-government. As long as you have an armband, you are free to go out to buy food. They have deeply understood our army and people's magnanimous and peaceful spirit, and know that we have never insulted or harmed him. We also allocated a large truck to the concentration camp to transport the Japanese troops repairing the road to a more distant place.</p>
<p>The officers and soldiers concentrated in the camp eat and live in accordance with the treatment of our army, and life in the camp is quite comfortable.</p>
<p>When the enemy surrendered, we did not touch the personal belongings of the officers and soldiers, such as clothing and utensils, except for military supplies such as weapons and ammunition. They once tried to give a pair of new leather shoes to one of our soldiers, but he refused: "We have plenty, we don't need your worn-out shoes."</p>
<p>Those surrendered Japanese officers still wear their khaki uniforms and high boots. Outside the internal medicine ward of the patient shelter, a piano is well placed in the corridor. As we were leaving, the sound of the piano floated leisurely from the ward. Before the surrender, could the Japanese army have dared to hope for such a life in the concentration camp?</p>
<p>The Spirit of Bushido</p>
<p>The spirit of Bushido, which has been promoted by the Japanese warlords for many years, has exhausted its military power and buried all the people of Japan. Now that Japan has surrendered and the Japanese army has completely surrendered, there is no news of any Japanese army committing seppuku here.</p>
<p>On the highway from Nanjing to Tangshan, five teams of Japanese troops are repairing the road in sections. When they see our car coming, they line up far away and stand respectfully on the side of the road. When the car passes, they salute us respectfully in unison. None of the Japanese troops who come out to buy supplies fail to stand upright and salute respectfully.</p>
<p>The rest station of the Japanese military concentration camp in Tangshui Town is Chairman Chiang's villa before the war. Nōse Yūzō, that short and fat fellow, received the notice the day before and led the Japanese soldiers in the camp to welcome us respectfully outside the gate.</p>
<p>In the living room hang the portraits of President Sun Yat-sen and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the national flags of the two countries are crossed under the ceiling.</p>
<p>When we visited each unit, there was a squad of buglers standing respectfully in front of the door, blowing the bugle call to welcome us. When the car approached the non-commissioned officer education team, several Japanese soldiers were in the grass field. When they heard the sound of the car, they immediately ran desperately to the door of the auditorium to welcome us respectfully.</p>
<p>Life in the Camp</p>
<p>The enemy has treated and murdered our prisoners and overseas Chinese in captivity with abuse and cruelty, simply not treating them as human beings. What is the life of the Japanese army in the concentration camp after the surrender?</p>
<p>Each person can still get 17 ounces of rice, 8 ounces of noodles, 2 ounces of meat, and 16 ounces of vegetables every day. They can grow their own vegetables and issue their own mimeographed news in the camp.</p>
<p>Their sick soldiers can still rest quietly, get full medical treatment, and yellow chrysanthemums are inserted into beer bottles on the beds. Everyone's face is rosy.</p>
<p>In addition to repairing roads and doing work, they have not only not suffered any physical pain, but also not been subjected to any mental oppression.</p>
<p>Can They Really Repent?</p>
<p>Before the visit, Nōse Yūzō expressed to us in the auditorium: "The treatment in the concentration camp is very good, and all the officers and soldiers are deeply grateful. For eight years, we have been very impressed by the great spirit of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese soldiers. After returning home, we will definitely bring the magnanimity and kindness of the great Chinese people to the Japanese people."</p>
<p>On the wall of the infantry education team, there are many Japanese slogans: "Build a democratic and free new Japan" and "Eliminate Japanese militarist ideology."</p>
<p>The Japanese sergeant translator who accompanied me on the visit was a young fellow. His wool uniform was old and tattered, and his boots were worn out. I pointed to his leather shoes and asked him, "Why don't you change a pair?"</p>
<p>"Shoes haven't been issued for a year, what can I use to change them?"</p>
<p>He pointed to his uniform and said, "I really hate this kind of clothes. I would love to change to a suit."</p>
<p>Regarding the feelings of the Japanese army after the surrender, Deputy Battalion Commander Hu said to me: "Most of the officers and soldiers feel that the idea of ​​exhaustive military power is wrong and seem to be determined to repent. A few children of warlords are still very rebellious. They are very surprised by the democratic spirit of our army. When negotiating the agreement, the hierarchy is obedient, and there is no sloppiness. Private life is not divided between each other. The regimental commander and the company commander, and even the soldiers, can play ball or drink and play guessing games at the same table. They don't understand this, but they admire it very much. Although they have surrendered their weapons and live in the concentration camp, their concept of hierarchy is still very deep."</p>
<p>On the way back, in the car, I thought: "Can they really repent?"</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Education in the Recovered Territories</h3>
<p>Since the recovered territories were taken over, almost three months have passed. All administrative policies are gradually unfolding, and the transitional period is slowly coming to an end, moving towards normalcy. Among the various measures, the education authorities have established certain principles regarding the handling of schools established by the enemy and puppet regimes. The general approach is that schools established by the puppet regime will be temporarily closed pending further action. All heads of puppet regime schools should be thoroughly investigated and punished according to national law. Teachers who worked in puppet regime schools must undergo a screening process. Students from puppet regime schools, regardless of their major, must attend a temporary university preparatory class established by the Ministry of Education for one year. Although the Ministry of Education has made the above decisions regarding education in the recovered territories, especially higher education, the Shanghai Temporary University Preparatory Class has not yet opened due to various reasons. As a result, students are out of school and lost. Recently, these out-of-school students in Shanghai have even organized petition groups to call for the resumption of studies. We believe that the authorities should make a decisive decision and quickly find an appropriate solution.</p>
<p>In theory, the education authorities' measures are, in principle, irreproachable; however, in practice, it is impossible not to consider certain important facts. Once schools are closed and teachers are screened, countless young students are directly affected. In Shanghai, if the Temporary University Preparatory Class requires students from different departments to gather in one place for one year of preparatory study, it will not only waste time, but also disconnect them from the subjects they originally chose to study. Although they are "preparing," their studies are practically interrupted. As a result, some students are still hesitant. Moreover, it is said that the preparatory class is delayed, and the excellent teachers from the original schools are being hired by other national universities. The ideal preparatory class teachers may not be able to arrive due to transportation delays, so the opening of the preparatory class is even more uncertain. In this way, young students currently have no books to read, which may have a serious impact on their psychology. Fortunately, under this situation, we see that the Minister of Education, Zhu Jiahua, proposed a very appropriate slogan during his inspection of education in the Beijing-Shanghai-Tianjin area: "The schools are puppet, but the students are not." Under this premise, the problem should be solved immediately.</p>
<p>Indeed, schools were established by the puppet regime, but students studying in puppet schools cannot be regarded as "puppet students." This slogan clearly indicates the basic policy of our government in dealing with education in the recovered territories. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, our government retreated, but the majority of the people had to remain in their original residences due to circumstances. The power of the state could not reach the occupied areas at that time, so "puppet schools" were created. The youths who remained in their original residences are the youths of the Republic of China. As long as they are unwilling to be slaves to the enemy and traitors, they will not lose their right to study because they entered a puppet school. Today, because of the reorganization of puppet schools, young students are temporarily displaced, which is indeed a phenomenon of necessity. The country loves young people, without distinction, especially the young people in the recovered territories who have suffered under the enemy and puppet regime for eight years. Today, the mountains and rivers have been restored, and the government is naturally more concerned about their welfare. The government's current measures for education in the recovered territories are for their benefit. In the implementation of policies, it may not be as ideal as expected, but we believe that this situation can be improved. We would like to contribute a few suggestions at this time.</p>
<p>First, is the policy of closing all puppet schools a good idea? It should be reconsidered. Many puppet schools were originally national schools, and the reason why a puppet school is considered "puppet" is because its power is derived from the puppet organization, such as the puppet organization appointing the heads of puppet schools, and the heads of puppet schools then hiring teachers and staff. Now that the puppet organization no longer exists, the heads of puppet schools can be dealt with according to the regulations for handling traitors. Once the head is removed, and the government sends personnel to take over, the puppet school loses its basis for being "puppet" and is no longer a "puppet school." This can be compared to the situation of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Under the slogan of "The schools are puppet, but the students are not," a reorganization and resumption of school should be adopted to prevent students' studies from changing. This is roughly the case, and Beijing and Shanghai can follow suit. This should be easy to do.</p>
<p>Second, there is room for reconsideration regarding the concentration of puppet school students for "preparatory study." If the government sends personnel to take over puppet schools and they are no longer "puppet schools" in theory, if schools continue to open, students can continue their studies at their original schools. They only need to "prepare" for some extra courses, so why concentrate them in one place? We feel that "preparatory study" is indeed necessary. Young people in the recovered territories, who have suffered eight years of tyranny under the enemy and puppet regime, seem to have become disconnected from the development of the arduous resistance of the motherland and the evolution of the international situation over the past eight years. Not only students in puppet public schools, but also students in private schools in the recovered territories, really need to "prepare" for some courses again. However, this preparatory study should not hinder their original studies; they can continue their original studies while preparing. It is said that this is what Tianjin is doing, and it should be implemented in Beijing and Shanghai at the same time.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the handling of puppet school teachers, since the national government has promulgated the "Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases," it should only be handled in accordance with the original intent of the law, and not arbitrarily. Article 2, Paragraph 5 of the regulations stipulates that "those who have served as principals or held important positions in specialized schools or above belonging to the puppet organization" should be thoroughly investigated. Article 2, Paragraph 10 stipulates that "personnel of cultural, financial, industrial, freelance, autonomous, or social organizations within the scope of the enemy and puppet regime; those who have infringed upon others by virtue of the power of the enemy and puppet regime, and have been informed or reported" should also be thoroughly investigated. According to Paragraph 5, except for those who hold "principal or important positions," they are not on the list for investigation. According to Paragraph 10, if they are regarded as cultural organization personnel (which cannot actually be cited), it is only limited to those who have "infringed upon others by virtue of the power of the enemy and puppet regime" and have been "informed or reported" before they can be rejected. Other general education, in the original intent of national legislation, was not strictly investigated. Even if puppet school teachers need to be screened, it should be easy to do and should not be summarily deemed unemployable. What's more, those who engage in natural sciences, whose subjects are mostly unrelated to politics, and who have been burdened by various entanglements over the years, and have only endured humiliation and remained at their posts, teaching young people scientific knowledge behind enemy lines for the country, should be re-evaluated on whether they are guilty. To screen leniently is more in line with the country's intention to cherish talents.</p>
<p>The cause of cultivating talents is planned for a century, and is the foundation of the country's destiny. Now that the mountains and rivers have been restored and the people are recovering, we especially hope that the enlightened education authorities will care for young people and resume school as soon as possible. The future of the nation and the life of the country depend on it.</p>

<h3>Indonesia's Independence in the West Indies: New Government Faces Test, This Issue is Relevant to All Pacific Nations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th Dispatch] The new Indonesian government under the leadership of Sjahrir will face its first severe test tomorrow, as the National Congress will meet to listen to the new government's main policy guidelines. The fate of this cabinet, established only eleven days ago, will depend on whether the congress approves or opposes it. The Sjahrir cabinet is composed of moderates who want to solve the issue of independence by renouncing violence, and are willing to compromise with the Netherlands if necessary. However, the opinion of the majority of the representatives of the National Congress is: "Whether we negotiate or not, we must insist on 100% independence."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th Dispatch] Indonesian Minister of Information Sjarifou'ddin told Central News Agency reporters that the Indonesian government is prepared to submit the case of Indonesia's complete freedom to international arbitration if current negotiations with British and Dutch authorities break down. The issue of Indonesian independence includes many political and economic issues, which the Indonesian government and the Dutch government cannot resolve independently. This matter concerns all countries in the Pacific, so there is no reason not to allow Pacific countries to participate in the negotiations together. The Dutch government's strategy is to negotiate separately with the Indonesians and does not want other countries to participate, which is not only unfair to us, but also unfair to other Pacific countries. The Indonesian government is fully prepared to accept a fact-finding mission by an international delegation to dispel various misleading reports from here. We especially welcome representatives from the Chinese government to investigate the truth.</p>
<p>Any Form of Domination Will Not Be Accepted</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Wu Qianzhi, Batavia, 24th Dispatch] Indonesian Minister of Information Sjarifou'ddin told reporters: Indonesia does not intend to seek external assistance in its struggle for independence, but assistance is welcome if it does not involve territorial or economic demands on Indonesia. We are fighting for genuine and flawless independence, and it is no longer a question of sovereignty that the Dutch insist on negotiating again and again. The question is whether the current government is the de facto government of Indonesia. Any form of Dutch domination will not be accepted. If the Netherlands insists on using force to re-dominate Indonesia, there will be continuous revolutions. The world should recognize this point.</p>
<h3>The Lives and Property of Overseas Chinese in the East Indies: We Urge Britain and the Netherlands to Provide Full Protection</h3>
<p>Joint Sino-Siamese Troop to Guarantee the Safety of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the Chinese ambassadors to Britain and the Netherlands have been instructed to issue notes to the British and Dutch governments again, urging them to fully protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th Dispatch] After the Siamese overseas Chinese bloodbath, it has been learned that the Siamese government, in addition to organizing a joint Sino-Siamese committee to investigate the truth, has also expressed its willingness to organize a joint Sino-Siamese combat troop to maintain security in order to reduce its responsibility and prevent the situation from continuing to escalate. The team has a committee in charge, with 16 Chinese committee members. Under the committee are three major teams, with 300 to 500 Chinese members, nominated by various communities and guilds to serve as outstanding overseas Chinese. Weapons are issued by the Siamese side, and the expenses are raised by the overseas Chinese themselves. Since the overseas Chinese have no other way to guarantee their safety, they have to increase their burden. This organization was established at the end of last month, and the overseas Chinese are slightly more settled.</p>
<h3>The East Indies Parliament is Drafting a Nationality Law: Our Overseas Chinese Will Be Affected</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th Dispatch] The Nationality Law drafted by the Standing Committee of the Indonesian Parliament will affect 625,000 overseas Chinese born in the East Indies, which is half of the overseas Chinese currently residing in the East Indies.

<h3>Dividing Korea into Two Military Zones: Kim Koo Expresses Opposition, Temporarily Does Not Request Other Countries to Recognize the New Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 23rd, United Press Dispatch] Kim Koo said after returning to Seoul: I will not request other countries to recognize the Korean Provisional Government for the time being, but I may raise this request in the future. I am here in a private capacity and hope to meet with leaders of various parties. The unity of all political parties is the first step to achieving independent and unique Korea. He expects that the situation of the Soviet-American division of Korea can be stopped early. When asked by reporters whether Korea might become a communist country, he replied: It is not possible to say for sure at present. I am a believer in democratic government. U.S. military commander in Korea Hodge solemnly pointed out that the return of the whole nine to Korea does not mean that the military government has recognized its provisional government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 23rd Dispatch] After Chairman Kim Koo of the Korean Provisional Government arrived here, Central News Agency reporters immediately went to visit him. He said bluntly: "I do not want to see Korea divided into two separate military zones." This 69-year-old leader of the Korean independence movement believes that this division will soon be cancelled, because he firmly believes that both the United States and the Soviet Union will do reasonable things for Korea. Kim continued: Currently, there are no plans to ask other countries to recognize the Korean Provisional Government, but he may request it in the future. At present, Kim and the personnel of the provisional government under his leadership have returned to the country as civilians.</p>

The reporter then visited Liu Hongyun (transliteration), Chairman of the Left Wing People's Party. According to the talks, he believes that Kim Koo's return will make the various parties move towards unity.</p>
<p>U.S. Policy Lacks Unity</p>
<p>[United Press, New York Times issued today] It is regrettable that the United States and the Soviet Union have failed to act in unison in Korea. It said that the United States and the Soviet Union now have a direct relationship in Korea. If the two sides have a unified opinion and are willing to share responsibility for the future of Asia, they can get a chance to perform in Korea. But we have not seen any symbol of cooperation between the two countries, and even the two governments have not openly discussed it. The State Department seems to regard the Korean issue as insignificant, thinking that there will be a solution when the time comes, but we dare not agree. The Japanese army in Korea has been sent back to the country, but the US and Soviet authorities still do not consider a plan to withdraw the occupying forces and continue to split the Korean territory into two. We don’t know why. In 1905, we caused Korea to fall into unfavorable circumstances because of indulging Japan. Today, we should painfully correct our past mistakes so that Korea has a chance to recover.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Orders the Japanese Government to Formulate a Plan to Levy Profit Taxes: So That the Japanese People Know That War is Not Profitable, the Shidehara Cabinet's Position is Shaken</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur today ordered the Japanese government to submit a complete plan for war profit tax in the first parliament of the next year, stipulating that Japan's companies and private profit tax be levied, and company capital and private property tax be levied up to 70 percent, including royal property. And ordered to stop issuing military demobilization fees and military pensions for veterans from February 1 next year, except for pensions for disabled veterans. According to MacArthur, a few Japanese companies have illegally become rich for many years through illegal and aggressive wars. The war profit tax will not only start from the attack on Pearl Harbor, but will include a period before the incident, and will make every effort to expand its scope so that the Japanese people know that war is not profitable. After the implementation of this plan, the distribution of Japanese wealth will be fairer.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] According to the US News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch, Japanese Prime Minister Shidehara met with MacArthur for half an hour today, but the content was not made public.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch] The Japanese Shidehara cabinet encountered what Japanese senior political figures called an "extremely delicate situation" this afternoon. Shidehara visited MacArthur this morning and met the Emperor. The tense situation may have been caused by MacArthur's order to the Japanese government a week ago to stop paying pensions to all retirees. The number of Japanese people affected by the suspension of pensions will exceed one million, 87 percent of whom rely on army and navy retirement pensions to make a living. According to current estimates, the Japanese government allocates more than 900 million yen annually for this pension and pension. What makes the Japanese even more uneasy now is MacArthur's instruction on taxing Japanese capital and war profits. The Shidehara cabinet will be shaken because it cannot solve this taxation problem. Well-informed sources in Japan said that the collapse of the cabinet will delay the election by three weeks or a month. Judging from the current situation, the cabinet is expected to last until the election is over.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Extended Trial of Tojo and his Cabinet Members: Matsuoka Kanesada Surrenders Himself</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 25th] General MacArthur issued a statement yesterday explaining the reasons for the postponement of the trial of Hideki Tojo and his cabinet members. According to him, MacArthur was ready to try Tojo and his cabinet members on October 7, but later, due to the failure of various countries to reach an agreement, it was feared that the trial would be delayed for a long time. He suggested that the example of the trial of Tomoyuki Yamashita be followed, and the trial be conducted by a US military commission.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th, United Press Dispatch] MacArthur ordered the arrest of Kanesada Kashiko, a member of the Black Dragon Society, and Kanesada has already surrendered. Matsuoka Yosuke, who served as the Japanese Foreign Minister in 1940 and 1941, also surrendered to the Allied forces today while sick in Tokyo.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] Zuiizaki Koraoto, the 60-year-old brother of Masaki, who was formerly the commander of Dalian Naval Port, and a member of the Japanese Young Officer Clique, war criminal and his brother's trial, will attend the trial. Today, it was talked about that Tojo and his associates launched the Pacific War boldly because they were afraid of being punished for their failure in China. The military was the main factor in launching the Northeast Incident. He made a simple statement to the United Press, saying that I have never discussed the possibility of fighting the United States with Hitler or other people. This answer was caused by the fact that Nazi war criminals mentioned in the Nuremberg International Tribunal that Matsuoka and Hitler secretly discussed Japanese-German cooperation against the United States.</p>
<h3>Hull Defends Pre-War Policies to the Pearl Harbor Inquiry Committee</h3>
<p>And Narrates China's Request for the US to Block Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st, Associated Press] Former US Secretary of State Hull submitted a 25,000-word statement to the Pearl Harbor Inquiry Committee, defending his pre-war policies and explaining why he believed Japan would attack Pearl Harbor. He stated that accepting Japan's proposal for a meeting at sea between President Roosevelt and Konoe would either create another Munich or yield no results. China would also suffer a severe blow as a result. After Tojo succeeded Konoe as Prime Minister, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek urgently requested that Britain and the United States send air forces to China to counter the threat of Japanese attacks on Kunming. Hull submitted China's request to the Army and Navy Departments for consideration. However, officials from the Army and Navy Departments implied to Hull that sending US armed forces to China to prevent Japanese attacks would not be approved. However, Hull stated that the Army and Navy Departments had suggested: (1) increasing material assistance to China, (2) accelerating assistance to the American Volunteer Group in China, and (3) not issuing an ultimatum to Japan, as requested by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>Britain Once Requested the US to Warn Japan</p>

<h3>Minister Chu Summoned Representatives of Puppet School Students Yesterday</h3>
<p>Explaining the Meaning of the Temporary University Preparatory Class</p>
<p>[Our City News] Over a hundred students from puppet-run schools such as Jiaotong University, due to the preparatory class issue, went in a group to Kang Le Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road in this city at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 25th) to seek a meeting with Minister of Education Chu Chia-hua. At that time, Chu was entertaining Mongolian comrades at the restaurant. Upon hearing the news, he immediately summoned the student representatives, listened to their opinions, and then responded to each one. He also informed them that he had already considered the students' concerns in detail. The Ministry of Education's running of the temporary university preparatory class was entirely to alleviate students' difficulties and not to make things difficult for them. He had said long ago that schools run by the puppet regime could not be recognized, but the students were not puppets. In order to enable the students to obtain legitimate academic qualifications, the preparatory class was being run. This was the necessary method to resolve the situation of these students. In the future, those who achieve a score of 60 or above in all subjects will be assigned to continue their studies in public or private schools. This method is exactly the same as in Peiping and there is no difference. Students should understand the government's painstaking efforts to protect students' studies and should not engage in unnecessary marches and waste their studies. The opening of classes is imminent. All unregistered students should register quickly in accordance with the regulations so that they can attend classes. As for teaching matters such as curriculum timetable arrangements, they can contact Director Li. Today it is raining, so they should return home quickly to avoid getting sick. The students were greatly moved after hearing Minister Chu's earnest instructions and immediately dispersed.</p>
<h3>Li Shou-yung, Director of the Temporary University Preparatory Class, Speaks</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Regarding the actual situation of the Shanghai Temporary University Preparatory Class, some students have not yet fully understood it. The director of the class, Li Shou-yung, personally delivered the following written speech to the students at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Aikemei Road Airport: Since I took charge of preparing for this class, I have held over a dozen collective and individual talks with the students. The teaching methods I have announced in the past have been based on a consistent plan from the beginning, with no changes or additions. Because some students have not yet fully understood, I am summarizing the various points and incorporating the supplementary measures most recently established by the education authorities to announce the key points as follows (those that have already been broadcast will not be repeated):</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the curriculum: In addition to the preparatory subjects promulgated by the Ministry that must be studied, the required courses for each department will be fully opened. If there is a shortage of teachers, it is planned to entrust the special commissioners dispatched by the Ministry of Education to transfer professors from Shanghai schools that have been suspended in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>(2) Teaching time: It is planned to use holidays and Sundays after the start of classes to complete one academic year of coursework.</p>
<p>(3) Grades in each subject: According to the supplementary regulations of the authorities, students who achieve a score of 60 or above in all subjects will be assigned to universities to continue their studies at the next level (for example, students who have completed one year of coursework will enroll in the second grade of this class. After passing the examination, they will be assigned to universities to continue their studies in the third grade, and so on). According to the above three measures, students' past academic qualifications can be completely preserved, and this year's studies will not be wasted in the slightest.</p>
<p>(4) The students of the fourth grade of Jiaotong University who were relocated to Shanghai have been scheduled to start classes within days. Students of the fourth grade of Shanghai Jiaotong University who have registered in this class will attend classes immediately. According to the Jiaotong University authorities, students of the third grade of National Jiaotong University are also scheduled to relocate to Shanghai and resume classes in the near future. Students of the third grade of Shanghai Jiaotong University will also attend classes immediately after registration. This curriculum will serve as the required curriculum for the third and fourth grades of the first division of this class.</p>
<p>(5) Students who complete the program in this class and pass the examination will be reported by the class to the Ministry for distribution to similar departments in schools of the same nature, ensuring that academic studies are seamlessly connected. Among them, students of Shanghai Jiaotong University, this class plans to report to the Ministry to distribute all of them to National Jiaotong University. Students of Shanghai Medical College, this class plans to report to the Ministry to distribute them to National Medical College. Other cases will be handled accordingly.</p>
<p>In short, the colleagues in this class are doing their best to uphold the President and the education authorities' earnest intentions to care for the young students and to seek convenience for the students in their studies. I hope that our students can study with peace of mind.</p>

<h3>Record of Chung Ling High School Teachers and Students Suffering</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shu-ying</p>
<p>Chung Ling High School in Penang has always been highly regarded and is considered the highest institution of learning in Nanyang. It has a long history and a grand scale. Its beautiful and well-equipped facilities are the best among Chinese schools in British and Dutch territories and Siam and Burma. Before the war, there were more than 60 teachers and staff members and nearly 2,000 students. The teachers and students lived in harmony and were as close as family. After the September 18th Incident, they led the overseas Chinese in their efforts to save the country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on December 8, 1941, a bolt from the blue struck. The Japanese invaders invaded the south. When the news came, people were panic-stricken. Before long, Penang Island, known as the "Oriental Garden," was bombed by enemy planes, with flesh and blood flying everywhere and corpses scattered everywhere. The bustling city suddenly became a dead city. On the 16th of the same month, the Japanese invaders landed, and the overseas Chinese in Penang were plunged into a living hell where there was no light. The teachers and students of Chung Ling High School were also in a desperate situation. The following is a brief account of their suffering:</p>
<p>When the Japanese invaders were preparing to invade the south, special agents had already spread their nets everywhere. The leadership of the teachers and students of Chung Ling High School in their peacetime efforts to save the country had been thoroughly understood by the Japanese invaders. On the day of the landing, the Japanese invaders deliberately did not make any noise. It was not until the spring of the following year that the enemy police began to search, gradually moving from Singapore to North Malaya. By early April, Penang was being searched, and Chung Ling High School became their main target. A page of tragic blood history began here. At that time, many of the teachers and staff members of Chung Ling High School had already left Penang early, but there were still eleven people left at the school. One day late at night, they were all rounded up and imprisoned, subjected to waterboarding, candle burning, electrocution, dog feeding, nail hammering on hands and feet... indiscriminate use of torture, cruel and inhuman. As a result, those who died unyielding were six martyrs, including Li Ciyong, Guan Liangong, Zhu Xuanyi, Ke Cuotong, Lin Zhenkai, and Jian Dejun. The remaining five people were detained for more than three months before being released. After Cha Qitang was released from prison, he fainted on the way and died due to serious injuries. Rao Baiying soon died as well. Only Wang Shiyi, Huang Ba-fu, and Mei Yingrong were able to go home to recuperate and rejuvenate. Hundreds of students and workers were arrested, and nearly half of them died. The brutal Japanese invaders swept away the teachers and students of Chung Ling High School and destroyed all the school equipment to vent their joy. It is heartbreaking to talk about it!</p>
<p>Now, the tyrannical enemy has surrendered, the sky is bright again, order is gradually returning to its former state, and Chung Ling High School is also repairing its school buildings and is officially reopening on December 8th of this year. Recalling that four years ago on the same day, it was the time when the tyrannical enemy invaded the south. I was only spared from the position of Secretary of Chung Ling High School. The pain is so deep that tears well up in my eyes, so I write this down.</p>
<h3>Legal Basis for the Trial of War Criminals</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders have raised important legal questions. Some international law scholars believe that although the scope of Nuremberg is broad, there are no precedents or regulations to punish the crimes of the defendants in Nuremberg. International law includes customary law and statutory law. The defendants in Nuremberg are being prosecuted because their acts of oppression, torture, massacre, religious, political, and racial exclusion, and confiscation of collective property violate the principles of humanity and goodwill. It must be understood that these actions are not legitimate actions of the state, extending its rule to other countries. From the beginning of their political careers, the defendants have had the malicious intent to endanger peace. However, can disrupting peace be regarded as a violation of international law? According to the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, war shall not be recognized as an instrument of national policy. And the ultimate goal of the Nazi conspiracy is the very instrument denied by that treaty—war, and their methods of warfare are also greatly contrary to the rules of land and sea warfare, and before the outbreak of war, they repeatedly overturned international agreements that had been established and guarantees that had been made, and even the most obvious obligation of "one country not interfering in the domestic affairs of another country" was not fulfilled. From the Treaty of Versailles to the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, all were destroyed by them. The establishment of the war crimes tribunal and the legal principles used by the tribunal are based on two international treaties, one being the declaration issued by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Moscow in November 1943, stating that important war criminals will be punished by the Allied governments jointly. The second is the agreement signed by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France in London on August 8, 1945, agreeing to establish a court and formulate a charter.</p>
<h3>Japanese Elementary Schools</h3>

<h3>Promoting the Free Flow of Goods, Planning for Navigation to Major Ports, Customs Authorities Prepare Implementation Measures, British Shipping Companies Prepare to Resume Coastal Navigation</h3>
<p>According to Customs authorities: Foreign trade in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other sixteen commercial ports has been stagnant for a long time, and shipping has not been smooth. This has caused many inconveniences in commercial development. In view of this, Customs authorities are now planning detailed implementation methods for navigation. Once the Customs deployment is complete, they will immediately begin to handle it. It is heard that the established methods are only temporary in nature, and the final decision will await government revision and approval. Furthermore, in order to promote the free flow of all goods and to prevent price increases as much as possible to relieve the suffering of the people, our government is currently negotiating conditions with two British shipping companies so that coastal shipping can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>French Ship's Arrival in Shanghai Still Awaiting</p>
<p>International shipping lines, British and American shipping companies, have already begun to resume operations, and the French Southern French Postal Shipping Company, the Norwegian Warren &amp; Co., and the Dutch Java Company are also planning to resume operations. However, due to ship problems, it cannot be realized for a while. The ships of the French Postal Shipping Company have already sailed to Vietnam, and the Shanghai route is still awaiting. The Java Company is purchasing ships in England and will soon be able to start operations.</p>
<p>Fake Shipping Company's Reception</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently began receiving the fake Zhonghua Shipping Company and has already completed the matter. The total number of ships of the company is more than 100, but most of them are ships within 1,000 tons. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is actively reorganizing, and once the repair project is completed, it will be added to the various shipping lines to enhance transportation capacity.</p>

<h3>Zhu Jiahua Receives Comrades Who Suffered During the War</h3>
<p>Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua received comrades and families of martyrs in the city who suffered during the Anti-Japanese War yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Minister Zhu delivered a speech, stating: "I have been ordered to inspect education in the recovered areas and have come to Shanghai for the second time. I regret that I could not meet with you comrades earlier due to the urgent schedule. Although I am now in charge of education, I have served in the Central Party Headquarters in the past and have been deeply involved in the planning of wartime affairs and understand them best. The hard work of the comrades who sacrificed and fought on the front lines is the main driving force for victory. The Central Government has always been concerned about comrades working in the occupied areas. Although victory has arrived, there are still many difficulties in nation-building. I hope that all comrades will continue to serve the Party and the country with the same ambition as before."</p>
<p>Representative Responds</p>
<p>After the speech, Wang Weijun, the representative of the comrades who suffered, delivered a response, explaining that struggle and sacrifice are the duties of revolutionary comrades, expressing gratitude for Minister Zhu's concern, and presenting five requests, asking Minister Zhu to forward them to the Central Government: (1) To commend the history and merits of martyrs and comrades who suffered; (2) To provide special relief to the families of martyrs and comrades who are now disabled; (3) To give priority to unemployed comrades who suffered in finding jobs; (4) To ask the Central Government to strictly enforce the regulations on punishing traitors; (5) To ask the Central Government to resolve the domestic rebellion and bring about political unification as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Four Requests</p>
<p>Subsequently, Li Shiyong, Jie Shaqi, Yu Yang, and Wen Guang successively expressed their opinions, asking the Central Government: (1) To thoroughly investigate the enemy's constitutional archives and commend the unnamed martyrs; (2) To thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of the enemy and puppets in Shanghai; (3) To establish a clean and capable government; (4) To quickly establish a school for the bereaved families of martyrs, and the relief of comrades who died should be the responsibility of local officials. Minister Zhu immediately agreed and answered them one by one, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Collecting Deeds of Steadfast Individuals: The Third War Area Military to Request Commendation</h3>
<p>According to the Political Department of the Third War Area, the Beijing-Shanghai area has suffered the most since the fall of the area to the Japanese for eight years. There is no shortage of shameless people who willingly sold out the country and acted as accomplices, but they are a small minority of the total population. Most comrades lived in deep water and suffered humiliation, waiting for the arrival of victory. Among them, there were well-known figures who bore the heavy responsibility of their hometowns but had no opportunity to escape to the rear. The enemy and puppets used coercion and inducement, but they were able to maintain their integrity and never give in, which is truly commendable. The Political Department of the Third War Area has now notified local governments to widely solicit information, hoping to report the deeds of such individuals with integrity to the department for commendation.</p>
<h3>Dai Gengxin and Others Fly to Chongqing to Discuss Resumption of Tobacco Factories</h3>
<p>President Song is planning to establish a national tobacco factory plan and has specially telegraphed the leaders of the tobacco industry in the city to Chongqing to discuss it. It is reported that Dai Gengxin, Chairman of Huasheng Tobacco Company, Shen Kunshan of Yizhong Tobacco Company, and Cheng Shudu, General Manager of Nanyang Tobacco Company, flew to Chongqing yesterday morning as summoned. It is widely rumored that the government intends to eliminate and merge small tobacco factories. Small tobacco factories have prepared a written opinion and asked Mr. Dai and others to submit it to the authorities on their behalf. It is heard that this discussion will seek to solve the problems of purchasing and transporting tobacco leaves and paper, in order to seek the early resumption of tobacco factories in the city. It is also learned that the Zhonghua Tobacco Factory, formerly operated by the Japanese, has been taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and is currently repairing machinery and preparing to start work.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Southern Jiangsu Carries Out Destructive Work</h3>
<p>According to the Headquarters of the Third War Area, the "New Fourth Army" in the Southern Jiangsu area is still destroying highways, railways, bridges, electrical and telecommunications facilities, as well as rural roads and rivers. The highways in Zhenjiang, Jurong, Danyang, Hetao, Liyang, Yixing, and other counties are all impassable. The Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway is severely damaged. Only the Su-Hu, Su-Xi, Su-Fu, Su-Jia, and Su-Chang fifth roads can continue to pass. The railway stations along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway have also been demolished, the rails have been removed, and the sleepers have been moved, resulting in repeated derailments. Wired communications between Beijing and Shanghai are also frequently disrupted. In the "controlled areas" of various counties, the Communist army has carried out large-scale destruction in order to prevent our army from recovering personnel and to prevent the National Army from entering.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on the Establishment of Bars</h3>
<p>Xuan Tiewu, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, considering that there are too many entertainment venues and bars in the old public concession and the old French concession in the city, which not only waste money but also affect public security, submitted a request to the Municipal Government to find ways to restrict them. The eighth Municipal Government meeting decided to determine the situation in each district. If the number of establishments is already large, no new establishments will be allowed in the future. If the number is small, the establishment can be approved. The Municipal Police Bureau has ordered the Business Inspection Section to formulate detailed measures for the above regulations, which will be implemented soon.</p>

<h3>Mayor Qian Talks About Merchants' Duty to Treat Allied Soldiers Favorably</h3>
<p>Since the recovery of Shanghai, the number of Allied soldiers arriving in Shanghai has been increasing day by day. All citizens of the city should warmly welcome them and provide favorable treatment and convenience for their daily needs such as food, lodging, and the purchase of goods. It is heard that unscrupulous merchants have exceeded legal profits in order to obtain undue benefits, or have failed to fulfill their integrity in terms of accommodation, food, and entertainment for the Allied soldiers, or have inevitably discriminated against them, all of which are insufficient to express the Chinese people's sincere friendship to the Allied soldiers and are inappropriate. In addition to ordering strict investigations and corrections, it is hoped that all merchants in the city will uphold President Chiang's order to protect friendly nationals and treat Allied soldiers favorably. In the future, all hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues must not have extra demands, and legal transactions should be made for Allied soldiers to purchase goods, in order to maintain good relations and emphasize commercial ethics.</p>
<h3>Warehouse on Qiujiang Road Burns Down; Three Deaths Due to Negligence in Renzhi Lane</h3>

<h3>Local News in Brief</h3>
<p>Japanese anti-war writer Wataru Kajii has been actively engaged in anti-war propaganda work for the Japanese army and Japanese prisoners on the front lines in various war zones in recent years. It is learned that he and his wife, Sachiko, will come to Shanghai from Chongqing soon.</p>
<p>The silk weaving workers in the third and fourth districts of the city demanded wage adjustments from the capitalists from November 1st, which successively developed into a slowdown in work. After mediation by Party and government agencies, the workers of each factory were ordered to temporarily borrow wages from the factory, pending a decision. Work was resumed yesterday.</p>

<p>Weather report: The Siberian anticyclonic airflow has moved eastward to western Japan. Tropical air mass is invading the Shanghai area, and the low pressure is moving towards the east-northeast. Also, yesterday's temperature was 60.8 degrees at its lowest and 62.1 degrees at its highest.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Prices in a Downturn: A Week's Financial and Commercial Trends, Gold Price Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Finance: Last week, the city's finances were tight on the surface but loose in reality. The daily interest rate of 1,000 yuan nominally rose from 10 cents to 30 cents, or 9 yuan per month, but the hidden interest rate fell from 18 cents to 15 cents, or 150 yuan per month. The price of gold first rose sharply due to the Municipal Bureau's crackdown on Chinese stocks, and speculators concentrated on the gold market, reaching a peak of 895,000 yuan. Then, it was reported that the gold market in Tianjin was cheaper, and the price fell, reaching a low of 740,000 yuan. Finally, due to China's participation in the monetary agreement, buying became tighter, and the week closed at 815,000 yuan, down 30,000 yuan from the previous week. It was once rumored that the United States would raise the price of silver. The most stimulated silver, with a fineness of 935374, reached a peak of 750 yuan. Silver coins, each containing 23.493348 grams of pure silver, saw a peak of 500 yuan on Wednesday due to U.S. troops searching for Mexican eagle coins, equivalent to 100,000 counterfeit currency. The week closed at 430 yuan, still up 30 yuan from the previous week. U.S. dollars were cheap and plentiful in Hong Kong and North China. Although there were high-priced sales in Chongqing and Kunming, the low was still 1,250 yuan. The week closed at 1,330 yuan, down 90 yuan from the previous week. Hong Kong dollars were extremely stable, with old issues up 10 yuan and new issues up 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Securities: Public bonds will be officially restored in the spring. The financial community is buying on dips, and with the victory of the National Army in the Northeast, new buyers are increasing. Unified Class C stood at 300 yuan, up 30 yuan from the previous week. The remaining Classes A, B, D, and E still stood at the 200 yuan mark. From the perspective of interest, it is more advantageous to buy these than Class C with the same 6% interest rate. Chinese stocks were first suspended due to the authorities taking over the stock exchange, and then speculators secretly traded in popular stocks. The price of Wing On Textile Mill fell 60 yuan to 420 yuan, Meiya Silk Mill fell 85 yuan to 280 yuan, and Jingfu fell 9 yuan and 5 jiao to 22 yuan and 5 jiao. Foreign stocks were sluggish because foreign companies were subject to Chinese law and could not be as free as before the incident. Ewo Cotton Mill's stock fell to 1,460 yuan, down 340 yuan from the previous week.</p>
<p>Goods: In terms of commodities, due to the government's low-price cotton cloth, cigarettes, matches, soap, candles, sugar, and the arrival of a large number of American cotton and wheat from overseas, importers and exporters sold off February futures, and people's hearts were abnormally soft. Analysis shows that food prices have generally fallen. Thick japonica, thin indica, and foreign autumn rice retreated rapidly from the peak of 12,000 yuan to 8,500 yuan to 9,500 yuan per picul, down 2,500 yuan from the previous week, as new goods from the interior entered the market in large quantities. Flour, only 44 catties per bag, once reached an unprecedented peak of 3,725 yuan, or 750,000 counterfeit currency. Finally, due to the cheap price of rice and the supply of American flour, it fell back to 3,450 yuan, a slight decrease of 50 yuan from the previous week. Among miscellaneous grains, wheat was suppressed by flour mills and American wheat, falling from 3,700 yuan to 3,000 yuan. Corn fell from 3,100 yuan to 2,750 yuan. Soybeans fell sharply by 1,050 yuan to 4,250 yuan, which led to edible oil falling sharply by 6,000 yuan, with crude oil at 23,000 yuan per 100 catties and soybean oil at 22,700 yuan. It is heard that every 100 catties of soybeans can be squeezed into 10 catties and a half of oil. The soybean cake after squeezing is used for fertilizing the fields. Shanghai factories also use it as a raw material for soy sauce, making a considerable profit. White sugar and red sand fell to 57,000 yuan to 62,000 yuan due to customs auctions of large stocks, down 12,000 yuan from the previous week. Tea has sales to both domestic and foreign merchants, and the price is 500 yuan higher, with stir-fried green tea at 30,000 yuan per picul and low-grade Keemun black tea at 22,500 yuan. Clothing and cotton were affected by the arrival of American cotton in Shanghai. Textile merchants switched to purchasing American cotton. Tongzhou cotton returned to 70,000 yuan, fire machine cotton 45,000 yuan, each falling 25,000 yuan. Cotton yarn rose by 170,000 yuan to 1.3 million yuan for 42 counts due to the purchase of fine yarn by merchants from Hankou, Changsha, and other places. The price of 32 counts and below fell by 30,000 to 80,000 yuan, depending on the price of raw cotton and gold. Cotton cloth, fine cloth, and serge were firm. Only Qishi Lin fell by 1,500 yuan, with a price of 56,500 yuan per 10 yards. Artificial silk, due to a certain stock about to be released, the price of Tianqiao brand with 200 pounds per pack fell rapidly from 700,000 yuan to 560,000 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was only 430,000 yuan. Raw silk mills are not doing well. The price of high-grade goods, 60 kilograms per picul, fell from 1.1 million yuan to 1 million yuan. Fuels are selling well in winter, and the price of Yangquan coal rose sharply by 160,000 yuan to 420,000 yuan per ton. The price of coal balls rose to 2,3000 yuan per picul, also up 4500 yuan. However, there is a lot of firewood being transported by land and water, and the price has fallen to 1,800 yuan. Among other cigarette categories, the price of British American Tobacco fell sharply. The price of 50,000 Big Ben cigarettes fell sharply from 1.04 million yuan to 650,000 yuan. Soap, due to the term of flat sales, fell by 5,000 to 5,500 yuan each. Huangxiangmao, with 120 pieces per box, sold for 10,500 yuan. Western candles, White Levis, fell by 6,500 yuan due to flat sales. Yafeng brand matches also fell by 5,000 yuan to 125,000 yuan. Newsprint, 500 sheets per ream, fell from 20,000 yuan to 17,500 yuan. Caustic soda, 600 catties per piece, fell from 700,000 yuan to 580,000 yuan. Pharmaceuticals, quinine, fell by 4,500 yuan per thousand pills to 32,000 yuan. All commodities are in a downturn. (Chongbo)</p>
<h3>Arrangement of Book Capital Amount</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>Recently, due to the exchange of counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes, businesses in the industrial and commercial sectors are reorganizing their accounts because it is inappropriate to continue recording amounts using the counterfeit notes. However, there is no standard method for determining how the capital amount should be consolidated or converted. The Accountants Association and the Industrial and Commercial Law Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are discussing this issue. Our newspaper has received articles from various parties discussing the matter and will publish them over several days to assist the industrial and commercial sectors. (Reporter)</p>
<p>Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the recovered areas are awaiting comprehensive management. The adjustment of capital amounts is the first issue that has caused us anxiety regarding the reorganization of industrial and commercial enterprises. During the eight years of war, the structure of businesses and the currency situation have become abnormal, and accounting systems have been forced to make strained cover-ups, going beyond the scope of normal principles. If we do not quickly catch up and carry out a comprehensive reorganization, how can we continue the past and open up the future? The capital amount is the first problem to be determined in accounting treatment, and its importance is a cause for anxiety for all those who study accounting, engage in business, even those who create laws, implement policies, and guide various industries. The Accountants Association and the Chamber of Commerce of this city have separately established specialized conferences and industrial and commercial law research committees to thoroughly discuss the matter. The entire business community of the city is closely watching the development of this issue. The author studied accounting in his early years and has been engaged in industry and commerce in recent years, and his personal feelings are particularly profound. He has received inquiries from various parties, but is ashamed to have no practical and easy-to-implement solutions to offer to society. However, there is one thing I would like to remind everyone:</p>
<p>The True Meaning of Capital: Capital is the remainder of assets minus liabilities. It does not represent the current currency contributed by the capital owner. In other words, the book capital amount is an abstract number representing the net assets of the capital owner and does not have an independent form like general assets and liabilities. As for the fact that the book capital amount often does not match the current value of net assets, and it can even be said that they never match, this is due to the accounting valuation policies and the business strategy of "laying a foundation." It has nothing to do with the total amount of capital itself. For example, if a capital owner invests one million yuan to run a factory, the original investment is the currency in circulation at the time. However, once operations begin, there are the equipment of fixed assets, the purchase of raw materials, the payment of labor expenses, the income from sales, and the financial transactions with banks and money houses, which are constantly evolving and changing infinitely. In accounting, a single transaction of receiving one million yuan of capital has long been transformed into various other transaction behaviors. Although the book capital amount is still this one million yuan, in fact, the net assets remaining after deducting liabilities have long been inconsistent with this amount, and it can be said that changes that are inconsistent with this amount occur at every moment. The result of this inconsistency may be profit or loss, with no fixed pattern. If the investors and operators wish to carry out final accounts frequently, settle the profits and losses, and adjust the book capital amount according to the procedures for increasing or decreasing capital, that is acceptable. Or they can delay the final accounts (of course, this cannot exceed one accounting year), and when the final accounts are made, deliberately hide the profits and losses, or falsely inflate the losses, so that the book capital amount remains unchanged or changes less. In short, the fact that the book capital amount cannot fully match the current value of the net assets that should be under the capital owner's account is a technical and even policy issue in accounting and management. However, there is no doubt that this capital amount is not the capital owner's existing currency amount. If so, we can then:</p>
<p>Calculate Two Hundred as One. Why is this two hundred to one? It is because the central government felt pity for the people in the recovered areas who were suffering from the circulation of counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes, and set this ratio to order national financial institutions to exchange them to settle this account. It does not mean that general creditor and debtor relationships must be handled with such a ratio. Nor does it mean that the capital amount of the capital owner must also be converted according to this ratio. Moreover, it seems that the central government has flexible methods for reorganizing counterfeit notes in the recovered areas, which can be seen more clearly from the conversion rate of counterfeit Federal Reserve notes. Today's discussion of the capital amount reorganization problem focuses on the standard of two hundred to one. However, they do not know that capital is not cash and is not the capital owner's existing counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes. If we speak from an accounting perspective, assets minus liabilities equals capital, and the equation is originally balanced. In layman's terms, the total of receipts and payments of various accounts on the books is originally "balanced." If you want to apply a conversion rate, you only need to make the ratio equal, and the total of receipts and payments on both sides will still be equal. The result of any increases or decreases in these assets through receipts and payments transactions still belongs to the capital owner, so there should not be much difference. However, from the perspective of business operations and current laws, there are many problems. For example, if the book value of assets is depreciated, there will inevitably be more book profits when these assets are traded. Therefore, the issues of labor-capital profit sharing and tax collection by tax authorities will cause unreasonable losses to the capital owner. Conversely, if the book value of assets is raised, the capital owner will have disguised and transferred unrealized profits into capital, which people will see as depriving workers of bonuses and evading national taxes, all of which we do not want to hear. In my opinion, the book value of capital can be appropriately increased according to the actual situation of each company, without harming labor bonuses and without evading national taxes, up to the point where the current book value is still retained to offset the legal tender amount. For liabilities that can be repaid at a rate of two hundred to one, they can naturally be discounted. Among fixed assets, it is acceptable to selectively increase those whose difference from the current value is particularly large, so that the book capital amount can still be recorded in legal tender at or near the original amount in recent years.

<h3>Beautiful Shot</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>On November 22nd, the Associated Press issued a telegram depicting an absolutely beautiful shot. Unfortunately, many Chinese newspapers ignored this telegram, so most readers did not have the opportunity to read it.</p>
<p>The telegram was sent from San Pedro Naval Port in the United States, saying: "Admiral Halsey, commander of the US Third Fleet, nicknamed 'Bull,' sadly ended his naval career. He said, 'I have lost my right hand.' Admiral Halsey lowered the four-star admiral's flag on the USS South Dakota and handed over command to Admiral Kinman. Admiral Kinman praised Halsey's achievements and said he had ended the most glorious career in naval history. During the ceremony, all 2,000 naval officers and soldiers on board the ship stood at attention and saluted."</p>
<p>This short telegram may be ordinary in the United States, but in the eyes of our Chinese people, it seems like something from a paradise. Because in other countries, the nationalization of the military is no longer an issue. An entire army, navy, and air force can be transferred from one general to another without bloodshed or a single bullet fired. Everyone is serving the country without any dissent. But this is still rare in our China.</p>
<p>To make China truly a decent modern country, the military must be nationalized, not the private property and tool of individuals or parties. When scenes like Halsey's retirement appear in China, China can embark on the road to democracy.</p>
<h3>Prodigal Son</h3>
<p>— Lei Wen</p>
<p>The prodigal son wanders in the mountains and wilds, the soles of his shoes are worn through, and his face is covered with dirt. He has tumbled through countless somersaults in this sea of unfamiliar faces and seen countless strange, indifferent faces. So: he is tired. He thinks of the warmth of his family and wants to return to his father's arms.</p>
<p>As recorded in the Bible, the prodigal son had many dreams on the road. He dreams that he has returned, his father is standing at the door to greet him, he runs over, kneels at his father's knees, kisses his feet, the old man puts a hat woven with flowers on the prodigal son's head, blesses him with jade fingers, and orders the cook to kill pigs and sheep and prepare good wine. On this day, glory is given to the prodigal son.</p>
<p>The prodigal son walks on the road home, and it is snowing heavily. The thin, torn clothes cannot block the cold. A blizzard blows in the distance. He remembers his mother and dreams of a brocade robe on his body. His mother's warm gaze brings pleasant awakening.</p>
<p>He is walking home with a beautiful dream. A little bit of the warm atmosphere of home teases him. The front is like a vast plain, the trees contain verdant green, full fruits ripen on the branches, phoenixes and peacocks fly in the air, and mandarin ducks flutter their wings in the small river.</p>
<p>Forgetting the abandonment and hardship, letting the snow water seep into the worn-through soles of his shoes, and the cold wind covers his torn clothes, the prodigal son no longer feels pain. His hometown is beckoning to him.</p>
<p>One day, on a gloomy night, in the jungle, the prodigal son sees the light on the windows of his old home. A tremor of joy runs through his blood, as if his whole body has been suddenly liberated. He rushes over with rapid steps, rushes to the corner of the old house, and he is stunned:</p>
<p>In the abandoned garden, his mother's grave is overgrown with trees. His father is trapped in bed, gasping for the remnants of his twilight years. The cowshed and sheepfold, without cows and sheep, stare blankly at the cold leaden sky with strange eyes. The servants' bedrooms have also collapsed.</p>
<p>In the declining hall, the eldest brother is grabbing the second brother's ear and shouting loudly:</p>
<p>"The part of the property that belongs to the prodigal son should be managed by me!"</p>
<p>The father struggles to lift his remaining body from the dilapidated wooden bed and weakly rebukes:</p>
<p>"It must be kept, I am not dead yet!"</p>
<p>But the candlelight has burned out, and the decaying wood cannot support the giant mansion. The old man collapses on the bed, and the earth cracks.</p>
<p>The prodigal son stands desolately at the corner of the wall, like a defeated rooster. Coldness wraps his body, and everything is desolate and sad. He slowly turns around and walks towards the road he came from.</p>
<p>The footprints of the prodigal son are imprinted on the snow, one deep and huge footprint after another.</p>

<h3>Thinking of Our Cultural Figures</h3>
<p>— Zi Mang</p>
<p>Can we not be saddened when reading news about the lives of cultural figures in the wartime capital? There are poets lying in hospital beds suffering from severe tuberculosis, there are famous scholars selling old books to make a living, and the lives of most writers are even more unstable and without warmth, so there is no possibility of developing their spiritual careers.</p>
<p>Originally, writers contribute spiritual food but also need spiritual comfort. But what old writers have received for years of cultivating and producing is only sympathetic sighs and mostly contempt, and they are not valued by the community. Speaking of this, I think of our some news agencies that have never been willing to release news of new works and whereabouts of famous writers, and I also think of our publishers, who rarely cooperate sincerely with cultural figures, but only treat writers as machines, without time for rest, or even the time for self-cultivation is deprived by the pressure of accelerated production.</p>
<p>This makes me think of the treatment of foreign writers. The government not only gives them the greatest honor but also a comfortable life, and the whereabouts of a writer are regarded by journalists as important as a government official. No wonder they have excellent works. But here, I have a thousand times more respect for some of our cultural figures who contribute their minds and energy while gasping under the heavy weight of life.</p>
<p>But from this, we must realize that rewarding cultural figures is an urgent matter. Although two or three cultural figures have received medals of victory, I think it should be given more widely. The government should also protect the lives of cultural figures and freedom of publication and should eliminate all obstacles to cultural progress. In order to obtain close contact with cultural figures, it is advisable to hold symposiums frequently and build museums of writers and cultural relics. If it is an author of reportage literature, he should be given free travel and convenience of observation everywhere.</p>
<p>These are easy for the government to do, greatly benefit cultural figures, and have a great impact on intellectuals among the people.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After Mr. Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, came to Shanghai, the cultural circles held a welcome party. Mr. Zhang also scheduled to invite cultural figures to a tea party again on the 27th of this month. It is hoped that such gatherings and other symposiums can be held at any time in the future so that the cultural circles can have an opportunity to exchange views on issues that are closely related to them.</p>
<h3>Mooring at Badong at Night</h3>
<p>— Song Mu</p>
<p>When the boat stopped at Badong, it was already dusk. A layer of misty fog floated on the river, and the undulating mountains far and near lay in the darkness.</p>
<p>People were walking around in a noisy mess on the deck. The tea boy was shouting loudly. Around the ship's side, a lot of sampans gathered. Men and women were tripping over ropes and rolling up their sleeves, desperately climbing upwards. The sampans jumped up and down in the rapids like flipping somersaults.</p>
<p>The sailor with a yellow scar on the corner of his left eye was already dressed neatly, in a set of blue cloth jacket and trousers, washed stiffly. He must have put perfume on his hair. As he walked past, he brought a strong smell. He spotted me, so he lightly touched my elbow, sticking out his tongue.</p>
<p>"Hey, aren't you going ashore to open your eyes?"</p>
<p>I followed him ashore. There was a very long stone staircase from the wharf to the town. I don't remember how long it took to walk, but I felt that when I climbed to the top, I was already sweating all over.</p>
<p>The town was very bright. Oil lamps were hung high at the doors of the shops. There were especially many vendors. They may have been waiting for the convoys to make a night market, loudly greeting the passing pedestrians. The people who came down from the boat were all attracted by them in piles. Some were sitting at the noodle stalls along the street, eating midnight snacks. The aroma of beef whetted their appetites. Others were fiddling with some small antiques, flipping through old songbooks.</p>
<p>This is a very small county in western Hubei. In fact, the main street is only one. It can be walked through in a few minutes. But because it is the hub of the Sichuan-Hubei waterway, the market is usually quite prosperous. A lot of tung oil and bristles from Sichuan are transshipped here. When the water rises, the ships upstream and downstream often pass by here in an endless stream.</p>
<p>We were in a * corner when that sailor friend of mine who dressed up was attracted by a sound. I turned my head and could see that it was a woman wearing a tight-fitting jacket, with a round *, her hair slicked back with hair oil. The flat face of my sailor friend also seemed to brighten up. He grinned at the woman, making faces, and then turned to me.</p>
<p>"Hey, is she greeting me? Why don't you go in and have a cup of tea? I'll have her find you a cute little *..."</p>
<p>The woman's face seemed to flush. I shook my head. When I turned my eyes again, my sailor friend had already put his arm around the woman and disappeared into the stilt house.</p>
<p>I returned to the boat tiredly. The fog on the river was thicker. Someone was humming Peking opera in the cabin. It was already late at night. From the surrounding sampans, women hoarsely shouted:</p>
<p>"Selling yellow fruits! Selling yellow fruits!"</p>
<p>The voice sounded infinitely old and desolate.</p>
<h3>Genius and Hard Work</h3>
<p>— Shu Kui</p>
<p>I often meet some young people. They often think they are very smart. They only need to read a book once; anything is easy to do.</p>
<p>But when I ask them about the books they have read, they can't tell me the essence of the books, and the things they do are not very good.</p>
<p>Why is this? This is because they think that there is nothing "difficult" for a genius, that they are a smart person, but in fact, they are the number one lazy bugs who have been poisoned by "genius".</p>
<p>Edison said! "Ninety-nine percent of the success of a career is hard work, and one percent is genius."</p>
<p>Yan Hui and Zilu were not smart, but they were the ones who transmitted the teachings of Confucius. This is because they put in hard work.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Maupassant is the king of French short stories, but when he started writing novels, he listened to the teachings of his teacher Flaubert and first described the different faces of a hundred people.</p>
<p>O'Casey is a new-school playwright from Ireland, but his first part of the drama was rejected by the Abbey Theater. But he was not discouraged. He accepted the teachings of others, and eventually he succeeded.</p>
<p>Balzac, the most outstanding genius in realistic novels, said in his autobiography: "I often write my novels with fourteen hours of hard work a day, and only eat some boiled water and white bread."</p>
<p>The story of the tortoise and the hare race is not only a teaching material for elementary school students, but should be used to awaken everyone.</p>
<p>"Fists are never out of hand, and songs are never out of mouth"; a musician also practices instruments every day, and a painter does not separate from his brushes and palettes. I want to tell young people that the success of a career and the completion of studies do not depend entirely on genius, but on constant and arduous practice.</p>
<p>"As long as you put in the effort, you can grind an iron rod into a needle." It should be our best motto for learning. My ability to write this short article is the result of ten years of diligent reading.</p>
<h3>Education through Entertainment?</h3>
<p>— Sun Jia</p>
<p>In Shanghai, some students hide in their mothers' arms and learn to pronounce unfamiliar words next to mahjong tables, and some college students gather to gamble on pai gow and study the changes in mathematics. It is felt that a large-scale "education through entertainment" movement is being promoted in the foreign settlement!</p>
<h3>Waste</h3>
<p>— Jia Shui</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported on November 17 that the four fake national universities and vocational schools in Beiping have a total of 5,000 students and half that number of teachers and administrative staff.</p>
<p>This means that there are 2,500 faculty and staff members. In other words, an average of two students is assigned to one faculty member or staff member.</p>
<p>How can so many be used?</p>
<p>I remember that before the war, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect public and private universities in various places and made detailed reports upon their return. Among them, it was mentioned that a certain private university was quite good at saving money, had very few staff members, and had excellent efficiency. The accounts were clear and understandable throughout the years, and they never owed debts. However, a certain university had too many redundant personnel. The number of staff members was equal to the number of faculty members, and the salaries spent were also equal, becoming a huge expense that was a waste.</p>
<p>This is all waste.</p>
<p>The author of "The Story of Mankind," Van Loon, said in the preface to "The Story of the Bible" that there are two things he cannot tolerate, one of which is waste.</p>
<p>However, China, although poor, has many wasteful things. Is it only before the war? Is it only during the time of the fake government? Even now, we can still see the waste of money, the waste of manpower, and the waste of life.</p>
<p>For example, some schools are stagnant, some factories are taken over but not started, and a lot of money is spent on decorating the facade. These are all kinds of waste. We hope that all kinds of work can get on track and that the phenomenon of waste can be reduced and eliminated.</p>
<h3>The Value of an Old Sword</h3>
<p>— Huang Wenjin</p>
<p>A friend, across the ocean, sent a letter from a place full of exotic charm. He said, in a crowd of strangers, how much a wanderer cherishes his old friends! When encountering difficult problems, he wants to find a close friend to seek answers from; however, looking around, he feels like a sailor on a ship, facing the sea alone, in deathly silence, coldness, and almost driven mad by the pain.</p>
<p>Indeed, when we are always surrounded by a group of familiar and happy friends, spending our days together in merriment, we do not easily appreciate the value of friendship. This is just like people in the city who are used to electric lights and do not feel the brightness of the lights. But, when we leave that intimate atmosphere and step into a new and incompatible environment, a feeling of loneliness immediately rises in the depths of our hearts.</p>
<p>Someone said that a sincere friend is like a reliable walking stick; although we may not lose him, few people deeply appreciate his value when they have him. However, when we need his help, we realize that an old friend and an old sword are the most reliable things in life. I think no one would deny this statement.</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone who lives in society should never tire of trying to find upright friends, from intimate ones to more distant acquaintances, letting friends introduce us to friends, in accordance with the principle of human interdependence.</p>
<h3>The Power of Emotion</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yu</p>
<p>I just finished teaching my students "An Episode in the Wilderness" (a novel by Balzac), and the students don't seem to understand its meaning very well. The story is about an escaped French prisoner stranded in the Egyptian desert, who suddenly encounters a leopard; he tries every means to caress this ferocious beast, educating and subduing it with the greatest emotion; later, he even forms an invisible friendship with the leopard, and this desolate desert becomes a small paradise. What is the meaning of this?</p>
<p>Marlowe said: "Hell is other people." How can our human world be hell? Please think: How much warm emotion have we used in our lives? We often put on cold faces and use sharp claws to seize things that are beneficial to ourselves, regardless of others. If everyone is like this, the world will lose love, sympathy, mutual help, and understanding, leaving only selfishness, greed, plunder, and conflict—isn't this hell? To rebuild our paradise, we must spread the spring breeze of emotion everywhere.</p>
<p>Humans are not born good, nor are they born evil, but are like a blank canvas. Emotion is what God has given us, of utmost value. How can we lose it?</p>
<p>This is the truth. Transforming the environment doesn't require great achievements. As long as people treat each other with sincerity, exchange genuineness for falsehood, and exchange affection for malice, the distance between people will be shortened, and the warmth between people will be increased. First, build the fireside in each of our hearts, and paradise on earth will appear immediately.</p>
<p>The Earth will be destroyed if emotion ever disappears!</p>
<p>All sinful acts can be transformed by emotion. Even a soulless leopard can be moved by it, let alone humans? Oppression is futile. Let everyone show their true feelings, understand each other, and return to harmony.</p>
<h3>Brand</h3>
<p>— Ji Wang</p>
<p>A brand, deeply imprinted in the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>Shame, trauma, anger, and hatred, these are indelible marks.</p>
<p>Having been subjected to inhumane beatings, waterboarding, forced confessions, and forced to write repentance letters and put my fingerprints on them, being at the mercy of others in a living hell, losing the ability to resist, I was simply like a living dead person. I was locked up for a few days, and then released.</p>
<p>Today, I am actually a "great citizen." The attitude that a "great citizen" should have is said to be forgiveness, tolerance, and not dwelling on the past. This is the virtue of our "great citizens." Alas! This is the sorrow of the "great citizen"!</p>
<p>Let this brand be forever engraved in the depths of my heart!</p>
<p>This is a wrongful conviction.</p>
<p>This is the sorrow of the "great citizen."</p>

<h3>Minor Spring and Autumn</h3>
<p>It's dawn. Yes, it's dawn, and our dreams are also awake.</p>
<p>— He Erbin</p>
<p>Illegal price increases, intended to be different from legal price increases: public utility price increases.</p>
<p>— Law Abiding</p>
<p>The authorities stipulate that the exchange rate between legal tender (fabi) and puppet-regime-issued yuan (pseudo-lianchao) in North China is one to five, but the black market rate is one to four point six. There are also bargains in the black market.</p>
<p>— Wang Zhengren</p>
<p>After the exchange rate between fabi and pseudo-lianchao was stipulated, Japanese gold prices soared. This is called "home flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers."</p>

<h3>The Enemy (Part 5)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>After agreeing, the two of them lifted the man up. He was very light, like a chicken that had been starving for a long time, with only feathers and bones left. They carried him, his hands hanging down, up the stairs, and into the side door of the house. Inside the door was a corridor, and at the end of the corridor, they carried him into an empty bedroom. This was originally Sadao's father's bedroom, and it had been empty since his death. They laid him down on the thickly matted floor. Everything in the room was Japanese-style, because the old gentleman had never been willing to sit on a chair or sleep on a foreign-style bed. Hana took out a soft quilt from the wall cupboard. She hesitated, it was a flower silk quilt with a pure white silk lining.</p>
<p>She said softly with hatred, "He's really dirty."</p>
<p>Sadao also said, "Yes, it's best to give him a bath first. You go get hot water, and I'll wash him."</p>
<p>She said, "You can't touch him. We need to tell the servants he's here first. I'll go tell Yumi now. She can leave the children for a while and come wash him."</p>
<p>Sadao thought for a moment and said, "Okay, you go tell Yumi, and I'll go tell the other servants."</p>
<p>But the ashen color on the man's unconscious face made him lean down to feel his pulse first. The pulse was weak, but still beating. He then pressed his hand against the man's cold chest. His heart was still beating.</p>
<p>Sadao murmured, "If we don't operate on him, he'll die, but I don't know if he'll die if we do."</p>
<p>Hana cried out in fear, "Don't save him! What good will it do if he lives?"</p>
<p>Sadao said, "What harm if he dies?" He stood looking at the still figure. This man must have extraordinary vitality, otherwise he would be dead by now. He's still very young—maybe not even twenty-five.</p>
