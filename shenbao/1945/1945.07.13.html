<h3>日規定「决戰運輸期」　促國民維護交通　內務省劃三十六都巿增產</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電日政府因國內業已戰塲化，特根據緊急運輸對策，定本月十二日以後之二們月爲「決戰運輸期間」，舉全力增運重要物資，今晚小日山運輸相特發表廣播演說，說明目前日本國內之運送狀况如下：「以國有鐵道本年二月問之貨運噸數爲一百，則三月爲一百十八，四月爲一百二十二，五月爲一百三十三。敵人空襲雖日甚一日，運輸成績反蒸蒸日上，且運輸內容亦以軍需省之兵器，彈藥及其他遂行戰爭上不可或缺乏重要物資爲重點，對於決戰戰局之增强，貢獻良多。又目前空襲之被害，均於極短期間內修復，四月，五月空襲雖加甚，而運輸數量反有增加，誠足吿慰於國人者也。然戰局日亟，以過去之少數職員，究難維護鐵道，而有待於國民各位之協助努力，因此指定國民義勇隊爲復舊要員，一遇鐵道路綫遭破壞，願各位即刻出動，從事修理工作」。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電日政府爲利用戰災　址增加生產，培義戰力起見，頃公布「戰時罹災地物件令」（敕令）即日施行，由此敕令，過去各種法令均不適用，開啓自由利用戰址之途。又該令之適用地方，頃由內務省劃定東京都等全國三十六都市，即東京都各區，大阪·橫濱·川畸·神戶·尼崎·姬路·西之宮·飾磨·伊丹·蘆之屋·佐世保·千葉·四日市·名古屋·橋·靜岡·浜松·甲府·岡山·吳·下關·宇都·德島·高松·高知·福岡·門司·小倉·戶畑，博多·若松·大牟田·熊本·延岡·鹿兒島。</p>
<h3>克服雨季困難　緬日軍反攻　蘇門答臘北發現英艦</h3>
<p>細甸前綫基地十二日中央社電緬甸方面之日軍，克服雨季困難條件，勇敢戰鬥，逐處迎擊來襲之敵軍，予以重創，加洛方面之日軍，於九日以來開始大反攻，予敵重創，逐步前進。又於庇古方面，目下正激戰中，今敵傷亡更形嚴重，致敵乃使第十四軍後退，而另編第十二軍，派　於前綫。</p>
<p>南方基地十二日中央社電　英機動部隊以空母二艘爲基幹，於十一日上午十時出現於蘇門答臘島北方陸巴古水域，飛出艦載機二百十架，空襲陸巴古巿。</p>
<h3>蘇島義勇將兵活躍</h3>
<p>蘇綫基地十一日中央社電蘇門答臘義勇軍將士之活躍，現由塔那瑪　島傳來下面消息，即敵軍企圖奪回蘇門答臘之野心，値太平洋戰局之激烈益形露骨化，竟派遣大批間諜團，於民達瑙列島，塔那瑪薩島及附近各島　行登陸，以該島爲根據地，開始積極活動。此項敵間諜兵之潛入，旋爲當地原住民獲悉，即刻報吿日軍守備隊，日軍據報，即出動討代，六月五日先後發見塔那瑪　島東部之敵根據地，加以製擊成功。又日軍水上搜索艇，亦於是月十二日上午九時，與由附近海峽北上之敵驅逐艦遭遇，當即向其挑戰，敵艦發砲轟繫，日軍則以機槍及步槍交戰，約四十分鐘，日軍絹川少尉胸部巾貫穿彈仆倒，此時義勇衛生曹長某，於船底制伏行近隊長，爲之看護紥傷，但敵彈飛來，貫穿曹長頭部而死。此時敵彈益形熾烈，艇上之勇士均相繼戰死，重傷之絹川少對即命令當地人某義勇少尉報吿此狀况，於此敵彈下，欲與陸地軍述絡極爲困難，但該義勇少尉仍奮不顧身，躍入水中，游泳前進，敵砲火無情，一彈飛來擊斃該少尉。如是雙方交戰××分鐘，敵艦乃向北方遁走，日軍以一小艇擊退大敵，又原住民義勇隊將兵之奮戰，已由日軍方面對此義勇單首次授與晋二級之榮譽。</p>
<h3>峇厘巴板　日軍戰果</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地十二日中央社電峇厘巴板方面之敵軍，十一日出動戰車部隊，企圖突破日軍第一綫陣地，日軍勇敢迎戰，擊毀敵戰車二輛，殺傷敵兵五十名，而將其擊退。又敵軍於答厘巴板登陸以來，迄本月八日止，日軍於該方面所獲之戰果如次：擊沉敵掃海艇六艘，巡邏艇四艘，大型運輸船一艘，登陸用舟艇三艘，重創敵掃海艇二艘，大型運輸船一艘，破壞或毀壞敵戰車八輛，擊落飛機二十，殺傷敵軍二千名。</p>

<p>東京十二日中央社電日第二次定例地方總監會議，於十六日舉行，關於各地行政之運營，繼續與政府進行協議，復於翌（十七）日召集地方總監府官房長官會議。此次之總監會議，因中央方面權限之讓渡，就業務運營之實際方面，與農商。厚生·文部·運輸各省作其體之協議，總監府　此次會議之機會，今後當將展開更積極之活動。</p>
<h3>出版物違法　處置問題　宣部發言人談</h3>
<p>南京十二日中央社電運來當有出版物違反出版法之規定，影響時宣傳文化政策至鉅，宣傳部發言人、特就此事對往訪之記者作如下之答問：（問）國民政府素重民意、且主開放言論，依照出版法之規定，言諭自由之範園如何？（答）政府所主張之言論自由，非放僻邪侈之自由言論，世界各國無不盡然，故謂凡破壞三民主義，違背建國國策，有損國家利益，危害社會治安，或企圖　覆政府者，均在限制之列。根據條文現定，如有違犯情事，得禁止出版品之出售及散布，必要時得扣押之，其情節重大者，並得永久登記之出版，一面呈請登記，一面逕行出版物者，是否合法，業經登記之出版物，需要更改名稱地址等項時，一面呈請變更登記，一面繼續出版者，是否合法？（答）按照出版法第二十六條之規定，凡未經核准登記之新聞紙，雜誌，不得發行，印刷人並不得承印，已登記之出版物，聲請變更登記者，發行者，得於其合法之聲需登記前，停止其發行，還反此項規定之出版物其發行人，編輯人及印刷人均應受法律之處分。（問）如業經予以停刋處分，而仍敢故違者，條例所定罰則如何？（答）依據出版法第五十一條之規定，發行人違背停刊之禁止而發行者，處一年以下有期徒刑拘役，知情而出售或散布此項出版物者，亦須受六個月以下有期徒刑拘役之處分。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>總反攻不可能</h3>
<p>歐戰結束以後，敵方作戰目標一致轉移東向，於是大東亞戰爭的前途，頗爲各方面所注目，而重慶方面，乃誇大宣傳及進行所謂大陸總反攻。日昨大陸新報，論列「總反攻可能不可能」問題，但我們從事實加以推究，認爲「總反攻」是不可能的。</p>
<p>爲什麼說「總反攻不可能呢」？首光，據一般的觀測、重慶預定的總反攻，是在全國統一和聯合國一致對日的條件下進行的，在這種條件之下，日本至少以戰鬥力的四分之三去對付英美蘇聯，只以一分對重慶。所以，早幾年前，已命令胡宗南張治中等在陝湘各地分任「總反攻」兵力的訓練部署及計劃。叮是，時至今日，一切出於重慶當局的意外。</p>
<p>第一，大東亞戰爭　發以後，南洋各地爲日軍佔領，英美退出，損失鉅大。加以經過三年餘的時間，在歐亞兩洲戰力的損失，今日之英美的戰鬥力，已非當時東慶方面所佔計中的戰鬥力了。他們帮不了重慶總反攻多少的力量。</p>
<p>第二，蘇聯和日本的關係，直到現在，未有重大變化，並沒有像渝方所假想的，日本須分出四分之一以上的戰鬥力去防制蘇聯的必要，而且，照目前宋子文赴蘇及三頭會議前蘇聯的表示看來，英美雖然急於拉攏蘇聯參加亞洲戰事，叮是蘇聯沒有那樣傻，不會無條件做英美帝國主義者的貓脚爪、這樣，重慶所盼望多年的總反攻條件之一，又無法完成。</p>
<p>第三，總反攻之外在的條件旣不完備。而內部的條件更多不利。例如巾國大陸的日本派遣單，始終保持染固的陣勢，不久以前蘇聯報紙論及中國情形，也說去年和今春，在華日軍獲得意外的成功，使重慶總反攻所必需的沿海及內都重要據點及交通綫，部被日軍佔領。這對於中國戰局，實爲不容忽視的焦點云云，由此，也可以推想其前途。其次，中共勢力乘若干間隙地帶而無限制擴展，這種新形勢，使中共對重慶的態度更加强硬了，這次中共對重慶參政會的表示便可想見，在這種實際情形之下，重慶必須用一半以上的兵力法　付中共。所以，重慶可以參加總反攻的兵力，充其量還有多少？這是一個極大的疑問。</p>
<p>更進一步，假定美軍在中國大陸登陸，協助重慶總反攻作戰，那末，重慶得此外援，似乎可以呼應配合，實現作戰計劃了。然而，這樣估計，芷是極大的錯誤。我們要認識淸楚，美軍在中國火陸可能登陸之點，南自海南島，北至連雲港，在這一海岸綫任何一點登陸以後，如果說即能與重慶軍隊取得呼應和配合，目前是不可能的。爲什麼呢？因爲在事實上，與登陸美軍可能取得呼應的却是中共軍的勢力，那末，如果登陸美軍與中共取得呼應，自然不在重慶總反政的計劃以內，必然爲重慶所不樂意的。而且更可能的，重慶爲要取得直接與登陸美軍相呼應配合，實施總反攻計劃，不辭先以武力排除阻礙勢力。在這樣的曲折的事實情勢之下，我們可以肯定的說，在重慶與延安沒有取得實際一致之前，所謂重慶總反攻是不可能的。</p>
<h3>日華協會昨成　鈴木首相等參加盛典</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電日華學會與中國留日生輔導總本部，現合併爲財團法人日華協會，於十二日下午三時半假華山會館舉行成立典禮，鈴木首相，東鄉大東亞相，我國王代理大使及有關人士均參加路典，首由近衛會長致辭，繼決定該會之章程職員，並檢討促進中日間友好各案，會員相互懇談，迄五時散會。</p>
<h3>最高國防會議</h3>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　最高國防會議，十二日開第七十四次會議，報吿事項（略）。討論事項：　主　交議，據行政院呈，本院第二五九次會議通過，司法行政部呈論修正戰時房　租賃特別法，附具修正條文暨理由呈核一案，呈請鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過，送國民政府公布，並交立法院備查。　主席交議，秘書廳案呈，准財政專門委員會函送奉交審查國民政府文官處請日本年五月份起追加國府委員俸薪等費概算書一案審查意見，請轉陳鑒核等情，請公決案，決議照審查意見通過，交行政院轉飭財政部照撥</p>
<h3>華北日軍報道部長易人</h3>
<p>北平十二日中央社電　華北日軍報道部長高澤修平大佐，頃已榮調某要職，後任決定由　關正爾中佐繼任。按尾關中佐歷任日大本營幕僚，陸大敎官等，今榮調斯職，必多建樹。</p>
<h3>日地下製造場　增產新銳機　不聞警報聲日夜工作</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電日國內雖遭B29型之不　轟炸，一部軍需工塲已成瓦　，但地下或山頂之新銳　製作工塲，仍陸績大量趕造，以供護衛皇土之用，如某地深山幽谷中，有面積七十萬坪之地下工塲在焉，數千人之產業戰士，不聞地上之　戒警報，每日每夜勵行增產飛機工作。又如某新銳機生產工塲，巧妙建築在高山之　，此等工塲現採取一日三工制，不分晝夜，生產飛機云。又日學生於學校工塲中，亦努力從事飛機生產，始則製造部份品，後更從事裝配工程，業有十餘架學生機製造完成，飛往戰之天空。</p>
<h3>九州四國　昨晨空襲</h3>
<p>福岡十二日中央社電　冲繩基地敵機B25型四十架，小型機約百四十架，以戰鬥轟炸連合編隊，於十二日上午七時五十分左右來襲鹿兒島·宮崎·大分各地機場，但因氣候不佳，一無所得而逸去，其中一部敵機，曾於四國西北地區行動。</p>
<p>福岡十二日中央社電敵機B29型百十架，於十二日上午六時左右，由宮崎縣東海岸侵入，一部經大分縣入熊本，其他於佐賀·長崎兩縣行動，一部於博多　及及關門地區投下機當後，旋由大分縣南部及宮崎縣北部逸去。</p>
<h3>日內瓦報讚揚日特攻隊精神</h3>
<p>蘇黎世十二日中央社電日特攻隊於冲繩海域之英勇奮戰情形，已震撼敵方陣營，頃日內瓦報以「日本特攻隊」爲題，揭載一文，力事讀揚日特攻隊功績如次：特攻隊之有組織的戰法，係在人員資材兩方，皆得以最高之代價，然由其效果而觀，實遠超普通飛機之上。日本特攻機，曾於五月二十四日以最猛烈之攻擊，衝入冲繩海域之美艦船羣，是役日方雖喪失特攻隊員一百十一名，然竟擊沉美方艦船達十一艘，在冲繩作戰中，僅美海軍兵員之損失數，即據尼米資司令部之　偽小數發表，已達九千餘名之多，美海軍囚損失過於重大，故第三艦隊遂不得不與第五艦隊調防，戰爭期間、在雙方對敵之生死關頭中，「我不殺敵人，敵人必殺我」，其理至明、然視死如歸之特攻勇士，更能發揮其最大之機能，對於破壞敵人之目標物，均能　萬難，以高速度完成其使命，此種奮勇精神，殊堪令人尊敬者也。</p>
<h3>渝參政會　開第六次會</h3>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電　據十一日重慶廣播稱，國民參政會會議第四日，於十日上午舉行第六次大會，首由兵役部長鹿鍾麟說明兵役署改組爲兵役部以來，八月間之召募兵員及兵役部之基礎工作。繼由參政員方面關於强制召募壯丁，虐待新兵，冷遇出征家族等，提出强硬諮詢條項三十七件。按重慶富局於此次參政會開愈前，雖曾獲得參政員絕對支持，政府之諒解，然開會後，參政員之態度，意外强硬，致甚爲狼狽。</p>
<h3>陝民饑</h3>
<p>北平十二日中央社電延安新華社，曾於木月一日報吿陝省大　　，昨合衆社渝電亦報吿，國民參政會第四日，有國民黨參政員王普涵提出救濟陝災案，略調、陝省旱災，風災，水災相繼而起，民不聊生，一千二百萬民衆中，有三百萬人無物可食，農作祇及平年之二成，政府應即撥五十萬元作救濟之用。又訊：峽西向爲產棉之區，抗戰區棉花之八成來自陜省，今種植已屬不可行，致渝方大悠恐慌。</p>
<h3>逃獻金</h3>
<p>中央社訊據重慶廣播，十日國民參政會開會時，司法行政部長謝冠生於施政報吿後，各參政員羣起質問：　全國慰勞總會之舞弊案，當局判決失諸過輕，　要犯李泰初已逃至美國，政府應要求引波，一時秩序大亂。按全國慰勞會常務理事李泰初，前曾將民衆獻金獻糧中飽潸逃，前往美國，參政員均要求渝府嚴行追究，然謝冠生之回答極爲含糊，致引起全體會員之公憤，蓋長近內地旱　肆虐，加之抗戰八年，民生凋敝，今李等竟以民脂民膏，供一已之亨用，民衆對之，莫不憤慨異常。</p>
<h3>渝延對立</h3>
<p>平十二日中央社電　赴延安遊　失敗　渝之參政會員黃炎培等，日來並未出席參政會，證明渝延對立之深刻化及複雜性。據合衆社十一日渝電稱，參政會員六人赴延之行已吿失敗，照預料渝延最近將再度開始調整折衝，哈萊大使之行動，延安以其態度有失公平，表示不信任，敵由該大使出任調停、難期有效果。</p>
<h3>準備本土登陸戰敵空軍大舉出動　襲日中小都市破壞海上交通</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　敵機動部隊於十日向關東地區發動第三次攻擊，此次敵之對本土航空攻擊，其由馬里亞納起飛之B29型機總數約五百零一架，黎明時之二百七十架，攻擊和歌山，大阪巿南部及高知巿，同時以一百二十架對　阜，四日市玫擊，另一百架攻擊仙台巿，四十一架於富山附近海面投下機雷。正午由硫黃島起飛之P51型機一百架來襲阪神，下午由冲繩起飛之戰鬥轟炸機一百四十架，對九州攻擊，敵於十日整日，先後以基地空軍及艦隊空軍一千九百四十一架，對本土加以攻擊，敵方所宣傳之「二千架轟炸」。現似已逐漸成事實。敵戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊，迎日對九州方面日基地空軍挑戰，B29型機最近由攻擊大都市而轉向攻擊中小都市，故今後敵攻擊都市將告終了時，必來破壞陸上交通。現敵正對各港灣投下機雷，企圖破壞海上交通，由是可見敵基地空軍近日極形活躍，且敵又復新設太平洋戰略航空隊，以斯巴茲充任司令，統率杜立特之第八航空隊及羅美之第二十航空隊，其主要目的預期實施戰略轟炸。此外，冲繩作戰終了後，敵新　機動部隊，最近亦突於關東海面出現，直接問接協力此等基地空軍，以期實施大規模攻擊，本月十日之二十四小時轟炸，乃遂成現實問題，蓋近代戰爭乃以空軍爲主力，吾人若瞭解任何作戰亦不可忽視空軍，則可知此種空中作戰，爲本土登陸作戰之準備工作，故對敵人動靜須抱戒心。</p>
<h3>重慶又發生　重大凟職案</h3>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電據重慶廣播，重慶政界最近又發生重大凟職案件，常局嚴爲檢舉，致風聲鶴唳，一般官吏均戰戰不安。緣重慶法院最近偵知中央信託局之凟職收　，當將該局全全職員偵查，結果將中央信託局儲蓄處經理王華建等二人判處徒刑十七年，惟案情重大，有　涉至其他機關人員可能。</p>
<h3>淮海省警局　加緊警備</h3>
<p>徐州十二日中央社電　淮海省會警察局爲應付當前緊張時局，特着各科室妥擬本年下半度工作計劃，據聞其將着重於警備方面，其他特高·經濟·司法·保安等，則加以協力，使省會治安確保。</p>
<h3>江蘇取締茶會　謀抑平物價</h3>
<p>蘇州十二日中央社電省當局爲抑平物價，安定民生，對於取締茶會，業已限令各業茶會一律遷向各業之同業公會內，藉以避免業外人從中活動之弊。當局頃再訓令各業公會，着令嚴禁業外人涉足市塲，幷已飭各業公會理監事切實負責，藉以穩定物價，安定民生。</p>
<h3>土外長抵倫敦　昨訪英外相</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十二日中央社電據紐約時報之倫敦消息稱，土耳其外長薩加，已於日前抵英，力圖探詢官方對處置蘇聯向土耳其提出要求兩項問題之意見，　加外長今日訪晤英外相艾登，會商一切事項。聞關於此次蘇聯向土耳其提出要求及其他涉及地中海之各種問題，均將於三頭會議中付諸討論、故各界深信艾登當有一翻新見解與新態度對　加發表。按蘇聯對土耳其政府之要求，在實際上係含有國際關係，特別以重訂韃靼尼爾海峽管理協定，致使蘇聯堅持其特殊有利地位之一項建議，同時又有南斯拉夫，比利時等各國，現對希臘政府一致表示反對態度，而此種反對之巾心，不外在響應蘇聯要求土耳其贊同重整邊疆領土，以利於巴爾幹半島諸小國之提議而已。</p>
<h3>鮑斯强調　獨立抗爭</h3>
<p>昭南十二日中央社電乘鮑斯主席來此之機會，自由印度臨時政府·定自四日至十日爲獨立緝念週間，對全東亞印度國內之印人，展開强力之昂揚獨立運動意識運動。鮑斯主席數次登台演說，力言日本必勝不敗，世界之情勢予印度及日本絕非不利，而英國之立塲，將益陷於困難之境，印度之獨立抗爭，唯今應熾烈展開，並昂揭印民及國民軍將兵獨立熱情，土氣益振。</p>
<h3>全英廿二區　總選舉開始</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十二日中央社電　據此間獲悉，英國二十二區之總選舉已正式開始，北英與蘇格蘭投票運動亦正在進行中，自由黨領袖辛克萊，曾赴各自由黨候選人員競選區域視察。在蘇格蘭西部，保守黨亦曾積極努力欲獲得格林諾克選舉區之擁護，按該區之候選人爲漢密爾頓公爵。同時，在波爾頓之勞工冀領袖阿特里，忽指責在選舉運動時之不良行爲謂：「當選舉運動展開時，有人散放空氣，或作種種不良舉動，實有傷我英國民主國知識份子之體面」。</p>
<h3>波蘭與瑞典　簽商業協定</h3>
<p>中央社訊據塔斯社華沙訊：波蘭與瑞典間商業協定，業在華沙簽字，內容規定波蘭將以煤斤，焦炭，鋅，以及其他原料運至瑞典，以交換鐵礦，各種機械，消費品，電話用具以反其他特製品。該協定由波蘭工業部長密諾，與瑞典駐華沙貿易處長恩格簽字。</p>

<h3>浙江塘樓一</h3>
<p>— 烈</p>
<p>塘樓爲抗垣西北之首　，素以出產水果著名，如甘蔗，枇杷，楊梅，　齊，香瓜，西瓜，桃梅杏李，菱藕棗桔，產量豐富，行銷外埠，年約數萬萬元。市上房屋鱗比，長約二里許，　隔數幢房屋，築一風大墻，以防火息。街道即在屋簷下，天雨無需雨具頗爲便利。惟街地係泥土凹凸不平，且極狹窄，而街旁因有小河相隔，致成一面街。但河西與河東，均設商店，咫尺在望，名日市心，乃商業薈萃之處。至於河南及河北街中，隔一廣　之運河，該河西南達杭州拱埠，東通上海，戰前帆檣林立，航輸貨運頻繁，但係過路碼頭。並不停靠也。</p>
<h3>民食佃農</h3>
<p>本地因地多圩田，且港　紛岐，鄉農均注重種植菓樹與水果、賴以生活。稻田收人之米穀，僅自給，猶處不足。此間並無大田主，每一農戶，祇多十餘畝，甚至僅一二畝者，　田耕種者甚少。鎭上之田主，自己不能耕耘者，始租與鄉農。秋收時以實物激租，每畝約二三斗。又鄉人在春天成育春蠶，並利用多餘之桑葉，兼育秋　。本地素缺雜糧種種，人民均食米爲主，不足者仰賴湖州德淸等處供給。近因產米區禁止出口，僅一部分小販運濟，以致米價飛漲，已達每石六土萬元之　。居民一日辛勤，難謀一飽。且米價騰踊，影辦木鎭商業甚巨，各店門可羅雀。又値××師駐樓，就地　餉，飾令商會按店供給軍米，以致商店停業時聞，人民生活之艱苦，可見一斑。</p>
<h3>敎育景物</h3>
<p>木鎭敎育水準甚低、祇縣立塘樓中心小學校一所，學生約八百餘人。又私立一所，學生人數相等。且師資極低，甚有本校畢業後，即充任敎師者。其餘私塾，敎師係淸代舉人秀才輩，幹此淸苦生涯，殊有懷才不遇之感。</p>
<p>距離本鎭八里許，有超山，山麓種遍梅樹，每屆初春，梅花盛開，濃香撲鼻，枝頭花朶，蔚成香雪海。承平時，杭州等處特開專車，爭來鳳梅，遊人如織。報慈寺（俗呼大門堂）前之宋梅，尤具特色，樹本僅存外皮，而枝幹碩壯，花開六瓣，誠稀有之物。寺傍有已故書畫家安吉　昌碩先生之墓，墓碑及撰文，係前考試院長戴季陶氏手筆。</p>
<p>冠生園之梅林亦在此，即陳皮梅之原料產地。山之西有龍洞，該洞深滾莫辨，入洞即聞萬馬奔騰，又似怒濤之聲，故無人一探究竟，相傳可通錢塘江，紅羊時會被堵塞。超山旁有杭塘公路直達杭垣，支路通臨平，交通極便·戰後　符遍地，民不聊生，風景區已一變修羅地。自該路停頓已數年，旅客往來均乘小船，然水路特殊部隊甚多，檢查留難，洗刧時聞，誠有談虎色變之狀。</p>

<h3>太平洋敵軍蠢動　日軍準備萬全　軍事評論家分析戰局</h3>
<p>本市軍事評論家頃就敵美英軍，最近在太平洋上之趨向，作詳切之分析如次：</p>
<h3>敵美準備次期作戰</h3>
<p>敵美機動部隊艦載機，此次向日本土東京製擊，窺其企圖，似爲跳島作戰之前湊，同時希冀封鎖日本土。吾人現對敵之目的何在，猶未能即加斷語，但敵方準備陸軍之兵力，迄今約在十個師團以上，其遲早必有所動作，乃毫無疑義者。今後敵美之兵力向何處移動，即可窺見其所循之方向。如目前向東京襲擊之敵機動部隊，據敵方發表稱：有航空母艦四艘，巡洋艦四艘，驅逐艦十四艘，在此情形下，敵方先將海軍兵力之一部份從事蠢動，此可視爲敵次期作戰之前奏。</p>
<h3>改用麥克沃塞戰法</h3>
<p>從冲繩島作戰吿一段落後，敵在人事方面更迭頻繁，尤可注目者匯爲陸海空軍之機構改變，如最近敵復派遣新工兵隊赴冲繩島進行工事，深信日美兩軍之前哨戰，業已日趨激烈化。據本月十日德里電，根據華勵頓之報道稱，最近冲繩島展開浩大之土木工程，建造强大之航空基地，其活動之工作人員及配備，超逾歐洲與地中海之工程二倍以上。又據本月十一日大宮島敵太平洋艦隊司令部發表，在硫球羣島基地之所有美陸軍航空部隊，悉隸屬麥克沃塞統率。查敵美航空部隊之一再更調，如麥克沃塞之參謀長兼機動航空司令喬治凱尼，除掌握第五第十三航空隊外，復兼第七航空隊，該隊過去係駐在中國大陸者。至於敵方所採用戰法，以往敵在琉黃，馬里亞納設立基地，向日本攻擊，不外乎尼米茲之戰法，但今已換棄尼米茲戰法，而轉用麥古沃塞之戰法矣。現在英美方面雖在積極準備中，如向日本土及大陸作大規模戰爭，猶不能實現，蓋以船舶及兵力之準備，尙不足應付也。</p>
<h3>日方早有萬全準備</h3>
<p>在歐洲之敵資批兵力，吾人預料本年十一月間，方可移至太平洋上，欲待歐洲之兵力全部移動完竣，須在明春四月。而最近麥克沃塞亦稱戰事結束，須至明年終。在日本方面，如疏散工廠强化地下工廠之生產等等，日本早有萬全準備，尤其維持航空機之限度，決不成問題。此外如本土之要塞化，一億國民之武裝團結，及中國大陸之兵力接濟等等，今後在事實上，決使敵人之夢想企圖粉碎無遺。據敵方所發表稱，美單在冲繩島雖破壞日　頗多，但在日軍之生產拉上所佔之數則極微，雖一再偵查日機之生產地及貯藏地，毫無着落，故機動部隊之戰術轟炸，亦無濟於事，因此頗感不安，此點益可表現日本地下生產及地下貯藏極爲豐富。</p>
<h3>遠東英軍作戰不力</h3>
<p>最近峇厘巴板方面之戰事，可謂已臨決戰階段。今後英國兵力將從馬來·泰國·東印度侵入，此乃可想像者。他如渝軍之進攻越南國境，麥克沃塞之侵犯婆羅洲，在東南亞洲軍隊與東印度洋艦隊之發動，在所難免。惟查英國眾隊在遠東方面作戰，祗從事宣傳，幷不實際作戰，例如在緬甸仰光方面，英軍猶與庇古之且軍猛烈激戰中。而在美國衆院議員阿萊特提出指責英國在太平洋作戰中，毫無誠意，祗事擴大宣傳云云，可見英國在作戰上之不力。</p>
<h3>食油業公會　定期成立</h3>
<p>上海特別市食用油業同業公會籌備會自進行護備以來，漸吿就緒·該會定於本月下旬成立，召開全全會員會選舉理　事。又該會辦理之會員登記、至明日（十四日）截止不再展期，無論　上海區公會會員及未入前區公會之食油同業，一律須辦理登記，否則當作放　會員資格論。</p>
<h3>銀聯錢庫　拆放額頻增</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業之銀聯會　準庫，對於同　拆放原有限額，雖經一度寬放其數量，但其限制　放　高額並不取銷，以示對基本會員行莊之權利一致，調劑公允。據悉此項拆放，行莊如於限額以內需用時，祇需十足担保當可隨時應用，然其特別需用，則須附加中請書，說明用途及需用之理由，方得照辦。緣拆放籌碼，旨在調劑同業業務上之必需，所有一切不正當需要則概予拒絕。聞邇來該兩業會庫拆放數字，顯較以前頻增，惟均在限制數額以內，各行莊之拆借　總報吿，亦依期　中儲金融檢查事務處。</p>
<h3>金證劵巿况</h3>
<p>昨日金證券到期與四期均較上日回小，茲誌價格如下：</p>

<h3>Japan Sets "Decisive Battle Transport Period," Urges Citizens to Maintain Transportation, Home Ministry Designates Thirty-Six Cities for Increased Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Due to the war having effectively reached the homeland, the Japanese government, based on emergency transportation countermeasures, has designated the two months from the 12th of this month as the "Decisive Battle Transport Period." It will dedicate all efforts to increasing the transport of essential materials. Tonight, Transport Minister Koyama gave a radio address, explaining the current state of domestic transport in Japan as follows: "Taking the freight tonnage of state-owned railways in February of this year as 100, it was 118 in March, 122 in April, and 133 in May. Although enemy air raids are increasing daily, transport performance is improving steadily. Furthermore, the content of transport focuses on weapons, ammunition, and other essential materials indispensable for prosecuting the war, making a significant contribution to enhancing the decisive battle situation. Moreover, damage from current air raids is being repaired within a very short period. Although air raids intensified in April and May, the quantity of transport has actually increased, which is truly gratifying to the people of the nation. However, as the war situation becomes increasingly urgent, it is difficult for the small number of existing personnel to maintain the railways. We must rely on the assistance and efforts of every citizen. Therefore, we have designated the National Volunteer Corps as key personnel for restoration. If a railway line is damaged, we hope that everyone will immediately mobilize and engage in repair work."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - In order to utilize war-damaged sites to increase production and cultivate war potential, the Japanese government has promulgated the "Wartime Disaster-Affected Land Ordinance" (Imperial Edict), effective immediately. According to this edict, past regulations are no longer applicable, opening the way for the free utilization of war-damaged sites. The areas to which this ordinance applies have been designated by the Home Ministry as thirty-six cities nationwide, including the various districts of Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Kobe, Amagasaki, Himeji, Nishinomiya, Shikama, Itami, Ashiya, Sasebo, Chiba, Yokkaichi, Nagoya, Fuji, Shizuoka, Hamamatsu, Kofu, Okayama, Kure, Shimonoseki, Ube, Tokushima, Takamatsu, Kochi, Fukuoka, Moji, Kokura, Tobata, Hakata, Wakamatsu, Omuta, Kumamoto, Nobeoka, and Kagoshima.</p>
<h3>Overcoming Rainy Season Difficulties, Burmese-Japanese Counteroffensive, British Warship Discovered North of Sumatra</h3>
<p>Forward Base in Burma, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in Burma, overcoming the difficult conditions of the rainy season, is fighting bravely, repelling attacking enemy forces everywhere and inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese army in the Kalaw area has launched a major counteroffensive since the 9th, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and advancing steadily. Fierce fighting is currently underway in the Pegu area. Enemy casualties are becoming more severe, causing the enemy to withdraw the 14th Army and reorganize the 12th Army, deploying it to the front line.</p>
<p>Southern Base, 12th (Central News Agency) - A British mobile unit, with two aircraft carriers as its core, appeared in the waters off Ruba North Sumatra at 10:00 AM on the 11th. Two hundred and ten carrier-based aircraft took off and attacked Ruba City.</p>
<h3>Volunteer Soldiers Active in Sumatra</h3>
<p>Sumatra Front Base, 11th (Central News Agency) - The activity of the volunteer soldiers in Sumatra. News has arrived from Tanahmasa Island. The enemy forces are attempting to reclaim Sumatra with an ambition as the Pacific war situation is becoming more fierce. They have dispatched a large number of spy groups that have landed on the islands of Mentawei, Tanahmasa Island, and surrounding islands, using these islands as a base for active operations. The infiltration of these enemy spies was quickly discovered by the local indigenous people, who immediately reported it to the Japanese garrison. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese army dispatched troops to suppress them. On June 5th, enemy bases were discovered one after another in the eastern part of Tanahmasa Island, and the attack was successful. Furthermore, on the morning of the 12th of this month, at 9:00 AM, a Japanese naval patrol boat encountered an enemy destroyer heading north through a nearby strait and immediately challenged it. The enemy ship opened fire, and the Japanese forces engaged with machine guns and rifles. After about forty minutes of fighting, Japanese Ensign Kinuwa fell after being struck by a bullet through his chest. At this time, a certain volunteer Sergeant Major, restrained the approaching team leader from the bottom of the boat and bandaged his wounds. However, an enemy bullet struck and killed the sergeant major. At this time, the enemy fire became more intense, and the warriors on the boat were killed in succession. The seriously wounded Ensign Kinuwa ordered a certain local volunteer second lieutenant to report the situation. Under the enemy fire, it was extremely difficult to contact the ground forces, but the volunteer second lieutenant disregarded his own safety and jumped into the water, swimming forward. The enemy artillery fire was merciless, and a shell killed the second lieutenant. After x minutes of fighting between the two sides, the enemy ship fled north. The Japanese army repelled a large enemy ship with a small boat, and the indigenous volunteer corps soldiers were awarded the Second Class Honor for the first time by the Japanese army.</p>

<h3>Total Counteroffensive is Impossible</h3>
<p>After the end of the European War, the enemy's operational goal has shifted to the east. Therefore, the future of the Greater East Asia War has attracted the attention of all parties. The Chongqing side has exaggeratedly propagandized and carried out the so-called "Total Counteroffensive on the Mainland." Yesterday, the Continental New Daily discussed the question of "Is the Total Counteroffensive Possible?" But after analysis of the facts, we believe that a "Total Counteroffensive" is impossible.</p>
<p>Why do we say that a "Total Counteroffensive" is impossible? Firstly, according to general observations, Chongqing's planned total counteroffensive is to be carried out under the conditions of national unification and the united front of the United Nations against Japan. Under such conditions, Japan would at least use three-quarters of its combat power to deal with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and only one quarter to deal with Chongqing. Therefore, several years ago, Hu Zongnan, Zhang Zhizhong, and others were ordered to be responsible for the training, deployment, and planning of the "Total Counteroffensive" forces in Shaanxi and Hunan. However, to this day, everything has been contrary to the expectations of the Chongqing authorities.</p>
<p>First, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army occupied various parts of Southeast Asia. The British and Americans withdrew and suffered heavy losses. In addition, after more than three years, the loss of combat power in Europe and Asia means that the current combat power of Britain and the United States is no longer the combat power that the Chongqing side had planned for. They can't help Chongqing's total counteroffensive much.</p>
<p>Second, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan has not changed significantly to this day. There is no need for Japan to allocate more than a quarter of its combat power to defend against the Soviet Union, as imagined by Chongqing. Moreover, according to the current situation of Song Ziwen's visit to the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's statements before the Three-Power Conference, although Britain and the United States are eager to bring the Soviet Union into the Asian war, the Soviet Union is not that foolish. It will not unconditionally serve as a cat's paw for British and American imperialists. In this way, one of the conditions for the total counteroffensive that Chongqing has been hoping for for many years cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Third, the external conditions for the total counteroffensive are not complete, and the internal conditions are even more unfavorable. For example, the Japanese expeditionary force in China has always maintained a firm position. Not long ago, a Soviet newspaper discussed the situation in China, saying that last year and this spring, the Japanese army in China had achieved unexpected success, so the coastal and inland key strongholds and transportation lines necessary for the Chongqing total counteroffensive have been occupied by the Japanese army. This is a focal point that cannot be ignored for the Chinese war situation. From this, we can also imagine its future. Second, the CCP's strength has expanded without restriction through some gaps. This new situation has made the CCP's attitude towards Chongqing even tougher. The CCP's expression towards the Chongqing Senate can be imagined. Under this actual situation, Chongqing must use more than half of its forces to deal with the CCP. So, how much can Chongqing allocate to the total counteroffensive at best? This is a very big question.</p>
<p>Furthermore, assuming that the U.S. military lands on the Chinese mainland to assist Chongqing in the total counteroffensive, then Chongqing will get this external aid, and it seems that it can coordinate and cooperate to realize the combat plan. However, this estimate is a huge mistake. We must realize clearly that the points where the U.S. military may land on the Chinese mainland, from Hainan Island in the south to Lianyungang in the north. After landing at any point on this coastline, it is currently impossible to achieve coordination and cooperation with the Chongqing army. Why? Because in fact, it is the CCP's forces that are likely to coordinate with the landing U.S. military. Then, if the landing U.S. military coordinates with the CCP, it is naturally not within the plan of Chongqing's total counteroffensive, and it must be something that Chongqing is unwilling to do. Moreover, it is even more possible that Chongqing, in order to directly coordinate and cooperate with the landing U.S. military to implement the total counteroffensive plan, will not hesitate to use force to eliminate obstructive forces. Under such tortuous factual circumstances, we can definitely say that the so-called Chongqing total counteroffensive is impossible until Chongqing and Yan'an have achieved practical unity.</p>

<h3>Change of Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Army in North China</h3>
<p>Beijing, 12th (Central News Agency) - Colonel Shuhei Takazawa, head of the press department of the Japanese Army in North China, has been transferred to an important post. The replacement has been decided to be Lieutenant Colonel Seiji Ozeki. According to sources, Lieutenant Colonel Ozeki has served as a staff member of the Japanese General Headquarters and as an instructor at the Army University. His promotion to this position will surely yield many achievements.</p>
<h3>Japanese Underground Factories Mass Producing New Aircraft, Working Day and Night Without Air Raid Alarms</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Although Japan is subjected to incessant bombing from B-29s and some of the ordnance factories have been reduced to rubble, new aircraft production factories in underground or mountain-top locations are still continuously mass-producing aircraft for defense of the homeland. For example, in a remote valley, there is an underground factory covering an area of 700,000 tsubo, in which several thousand industrial soldiers work day and night, stepping up aircraft production, unperturbed by air raid alarms. Another new aircraft production factory is cleverly constructed on the slopes of a high mountain. These factories have now adopted a three-shift system, producing aircraft day and night. Furthermore, students in school factories are also working hard on aircraft production, starting with the manufacture of parts and then moving on to assembly work. More than a dozen student aircraft have been completed and flown to the skies of war.</p>
<h3>Kyushu and Shikoku Attacked by Air Raids Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Fukuoka, 12th (Central News Agency) - Forty enemy B-25 aircraft from the Okinawa base, and about 140 smaller aircraft, formed a combat-bomber combined unit, attacked the airports in Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Oita at around 7:50 AM on the 12th, but because of bad weather, they gained nothing and fled. A part of the enemy aircraft had moved in the northwest area of Shikoku.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 12th (Central News Agency) - About 110 enemy B-29 aircraft invaded from the east coast of Miyazaki Prefecture at around 6:00 AM on the 12th, part of them entered Kumamoto via Oita Prefecture, and others operated in Saga and Nagasaki Prefectures. After a part of the enemy airplanes dropped bombs in the Hakata area and the Kanmon area, they fled from the southern part of Oita Prefecture and the northern part of Miyazaki Prefecture.</p>
<h3>Geneva Newspaper Praises the Spirit of Japanese Special Attack Forces</h3>
<p>Zurich, 12th (Central News Agency) - The valiant struggle of the Japanese Special Attack Forces in the waters off Okinawa has shocked the enemy's ranks. The Geneva newspaper recently published an article titled "Japanese Special Attack Forces," praising the achievements of the Japanese Special Attack Forces as follows: The organized tactics of the Special Attack Forces allow for the highest cost-effectiveness in terms of both personnel and materials. From the perspective of its effect, it far surpasses ordinary aircraft. On May 24th, Japanese Special Attack aircraft launched the fiercest attack, crashing into the American fleet in the waters off Okinawa. Although the Japanese side lost 111 Special Attack Force members in this battle, they sunk eleven American ships. During the Okinawa operation, the number of American naval personnel lost alone, according to the 伪小数 published by the Nimitz Command, has reached more than 9,000. The American naval casualties were too great, so the Third Fleet had to be transferred to replace the Fifth Fleet. During the war, in the face of life and death between the two sides, "If I do not kill the enemy, the enemy will kill me," the principle is clear. However, the Special Attack Force warriors, who regard death as home, can better exert their greatest function. They can overcome all difficulties to destroy the enemy's targets at high speed to complete their mission. This courageous spirit is truly worthy of respect.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Senate Holds Sixth Meeting</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing broadcast on the 11th, the fourth day of the National Senate meeting was held on the morning of the 10th in the sixth meeting. First, Lu Zhonglin, Minister of Conscription, explained the work of the Conscription Department and the recruitment of soldiers in August. Then, the senators raised 37 strong consultation items regarding the forced conscription of strong men, mistreatment of recruits, and cold treatment of families of soldiers going to war. According to sources, although the Chongqing authorities had obtained the absolute support of the senators and the understanding of the government before the opening of this Senate, the attitude of the senators was unexpectedly tough after the meeting opened, causing them to be very embarrassed.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Famine</h3>
<p>Beijing, 12th (Central News Agency) - Yan'an Xinhua News Agency reported on the famine in Shaanxi Province on the 1st of this month. Yesterday, the Associated Press Chongqing telegram also reported that on the fourth day of the National Senate meeting, Kuomintang Senator Wang Puhan raised a motion to relieve the disaster in Shaanxi, briefly stating that drought, wind, and flood disasters occurred in Shaanxi Province one after another, and the people were destitute. Among the 12 million people, 3 million had nothing to eat, and agricultural production only reached 20% of the normal year. The government should allocate 500,000 yuan for relief. Furthermore, Shaanxi has always been a cotton-producing area, and 80% of the cotton in the anti-Japanese war area comes from Shaanxi. Now planting is no longer feasible, causing great panic on the Chongqing side.</p>
<h3>Embezzled Donations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that according to Chongqing Radio, when the National Senate held a meeting on the 10th, Minister of Justice and Administration Xie Guansheng was questioned by senators after his policy report. The senators stated that the judgment on the corruption case of the National Comfort Association was too lenient, and the main culprit, Li Taichu, had fled to the United States. The government should request extradition. At one point, the order was in chaos. According to sources, Li Taichu, the managing director of the National Comfort Association, had previously embezzled popular donations of money and food and fled to the United States. The senators requested that the Chongqing government severely investigate the matter, but Xie Guansheng's response was extremely vague, causing the public anger of all members. With drought and flood rampant in the mainland in recent years, coupled with the eight years of the war of resistance, the people's livelihood is declining. Now Li and others are using the people's hard-earned money for their own enjoyment, which is causing extreme indignation among the people.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Chongqing and Yan'an</h3>
<p>Beijing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The members of the Senate who failed to visit Yan'an, Huang Yanpei, and others, have not attended the Senate meeting in recent days, proving the deepening and complexity of the conflict between Chongqing and Yan'an. According to a Chongqing telegram from the Associated Press on the 11th, the trip to Yan'an by six senators has failed. As expected, Chongqing and Yan'an will soon begin to adjust and negotiate again. Yan'an expressed a lack of trust in Ambassador Hurley's actions due to his unfair attitude. It is difficult to expect his mediation to have any effect.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Homeland Landing Operations, Enemy Air Force Launches Major Offensive, Attacking Small and Medium-Sized Japanese Cities to Disrupt Maritime Transportation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - On the 10th, enemy mobile forces launched a third attack on the Kanto region. For this enemy aerial attack on the homeland, the total number of B-29 aircraft taking off from the Marianas was about 501. At dawn, 270 aircraft attacked Wakayama, the southern part of Osaka, and Kochi. At the same time, 120 aircraft attacked Gifu and Yokkaichi, and another 100 aircraft attacked Sendai. Forty-one aircraft dropped mines near Toyama. At noon, 100 P-51 aircraft taking off from Iwo Jima attacked the Hanshin area. In the afternoon, 140 fighter-bombers taking off from Okinawa attacked Kyushu. On the 10th, the enemy launched a total of 1,941 aircraft from base air forces and fleet air forces to attack the homeland. The enemy's propaganda of a "2,000-plane bombing" now seems to be gradually becoming a reality. The enemy fighter-bomber combined unit challenged the Japanese base air force in the Kyushu area. B-29 aircraft have recently switched from attacking large cities to attacking small and medium-sized cities. Therefore, when the enemy ends its attacks on cities in the future, it will inevitably come to disrupt land transportation. The enemy is currently dropping mines in various ports, attempting to disrupt maritime transportation. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's base air force has been extremely active recently. Furthermore, the enemy has re-established the Pacific Strategic Air Force, with Spaatz as commander, leading Doolittle's Eighth Air Force and LeMay's Twentieth Air Force. Its main purpose is expected to implement strategic bombing. In addition, after the end of the Okinawa operation, the enemy's new mobile forces have recently appeared suddenly in the waters off Kanto, directly and indirectly cooperating with these base air forces in order to carry out large-scale attacks. The 24-hour bombing on the 10th of this month has become a reality. Since modern warfare is based on the air force as the main force, if we understand that any operation cannot ignore the air force, we can know that this kind of aerial operation is a preparatory work for the homeland landing operation. Therefore, we must be vigilant about the enemy's movements.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Experiences Another Major Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to Chongqing radio, a major embezzlement case has recently occurred in Chongqing political circles. The Standing Committee is severely investigating, causing widespread panic, and government officials are generally uneasy. It is reported that the Chongqing court recently detected embezzlement and bribery within the Central Trust Bureau. It investigated all officials of the bureau, resulting in the sentencing of Wang Huajian, manager of the savings department of the Central Trust Bureau, and another person, to seventeen years in prison. However, the case is serious and may involve personnel from other institutions.</p>
<h3>Huaihai Provincial Police Bureau Intensifies Security</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to cope with the current tense situation, the Huaihai Provincial Capital Police Bureau has instructed all departments to properly draft their work plans for the second half of the year.

<h3>Jiangsu Bans Tea Gatherings to Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the provincial authorities have ordered that all trade tea gatherings be moved to the respective trade associations, in order to avoid outsiders engaging in illicit activities. The authorities recently instructed all trade associations to strictly prohibit outsiders from entering the market and ordered the directors and supervisors of the associations to take responsibility to stabilize prices and people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Arrives in London, Visits British Foreign Secretary Yesterday</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a London dispatch from the New York Times, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu arrived in England a few days ago to explore the official views on how to deal with the two issues raised by the Soviet Union to Turkey. Saracoğlu met with British Foreign Secretary Eden today to discuss all matters. It is reported that the demands made by the Soviet Union to Turkey and other issues related to the Mediterranean will be discussed at the Three-Power Conference, so it is widely believed that Eden will have new insights and attitudes to present to Saracoğlu. The Soviet Union's demands on the Turkish government effectively contain a proposal involving international relations, particularly the redefinition of the Straits of Dardanelles management agreement, so that the Soviet Union insists on its specially advantageous position. At the same time, Yugoslavia, Belgium and other countries have expressed opposition to the Greek government, and the heart of this opposition lies in responding to the Soviet Union's request that Turkey agree to the reorganization of border territories to benefit the smaller countries of the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<h3>Bose Emphasizes Independent Resistance</h3>
<p>Shonan, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Taking advantage of Chairman Bose's visit here, the Provisional Government of Free India has decided to hold an "Independent Memorial Week" from the 4th to the 10th to launch a powerful movement to raise awareness of the independent movement among Indians in East Asia. Chairman Bose delivered several speeches, emphasizing that Japan would surely win and not be defeated, that the world situation was definitely not unfavorable to India and Japan, and that Britain's position would become increasingly difficult. India's independent resistance should be fiercely launched now, and the independent enthusiasm and morale of the Indian people and the National Army soldiers should be boosted.</p>
<h3>General Election Begins in Twenty-Two Districts Throughout England</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) – It is reported from here that the general election in the twenty-two districts of England has officially begun, and voting is also underway in Northern England and Scotland. Liberal Party leader Sinclair has visited the constituencies of various Liberal Party candidates to inspect the situation. In western Scotland, the Conservative Party has also actively sought support in the Greenock constituency, where the candidate is the Duke of Hamilton. At the same time, Labour Party leader Attlee in Bolton suddenly criticized improper conduct during the election campaign, saying, "When the election campaign unfolds, someone releases air or takes various improper actions, which damages the dignity of our British democratic intellectuals."</p>
<h3>Poland and Sweden Sign Commercial Agreement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from TASS, Warsaw: A commercial agreement between Poland and Sweden has been signed in Warsaw.

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Tanglou One</h3>
<p>— A Vivid Description</p>
<p>Tanglou is the first town northwest of Kangyuan, famous for its fruit production, such as sugarcane, loquat, bayberry, lychee, cantaloupe, watermelon, peaches, plums, apricots, pears, water chestnuts, lotus roots, dates, and tangerines. The output is abundant, and it is sold to other places, amounting to tens of millions of yuan annually. The houses in the market are close together, about two li long. Every few houses, a windbreak wall is built to prevent fires. The street is under the eaves, so there is no need for rain gear when it rains, which is quite convenient. However, the street surface is muddy and uneven, and extremely narrow. Moreover, the street is separated by a small river, forming a single street. However, both the west and east sides of the river have shops, within sight of each other, known as the "city center," which is a commercial hub. As for the middle of the streets south and north of the river, there is a wide canal. The canal reaches Gongbu in Hangzhou to the southwest and Shanghai to the east. Before the war, sails were numerous, and freight transport was frequent, but it was only a passing dock. It does not stop.</p>
<h3>People's Food and Tenant Farmers</h3>
<p>Because there are many polder fields and branching waterways in this area, local farmers focus on planting fruit trees and fruits for a living. The rice harvested from the rice fields is only enough for self-sufficiency and is still insufficient. There are no large landowners here. Each farmer has only ten or so mu, or even only one or two mu. Very few people rent land for cultivation. The landowners in the town, who cannot cultivate themselves, rent to farmers. At harvest time, rent is paid in kind, about two or three dou per mu. Also, the villagers raise silkworms in the spring and use the surplus mulberry leaves to raise autumn silkworms. This area has traditionally lacked various grains, and people mainly eat rice. Any shortfall is supplied by Huzhou Deqing and other places. Recently, because rice-producing areas have banned exports, only a small number of vendors transport it, causing rice prices to soar, reaching 60,000 yuan per stone. Residents work hard all day but find it difficult to get enough to eat. The soaring rice prices have had a huge impact on the commerce of Mutown. The shops are deserted. Moreover, when the ×× Division is stationed in the town, it requisitions supplies locally, ordering the chamber of commerce to supply military rice according to the shops, causing shops to close from time to time. The hardship of people's lives is evident.</p>
<h3>Education and Scenery</h3>
<p>The level of education in Mutown is very low. There is only one Tanglou Central Elementary School run by the county, with about 800 students. There is also one private school, with the same number of students. Moreover, the teachers are of very low quality. Some even become teachers immediately after graduating from the school. The teachers in the remaining private schools are Qing dynasty graduates and scholars, leading this difficult life, with a feeling of not being able to use their talents.</p>
<p>About eight li from the town is Chao Mountain. The foothills are planted with plum trees. Every early spring, the plum blossoms are in full bloom, with a rich fragrance. The flowers on the branches form a sea of fragrant snow. In peacetime, special trains were opened from Hangzhou and other places, competing to visit the plum blossoms, with crowds of tourists. The Song plum in front of Bao Ci Temple (commonly known as Damentang) is particularly distinctive. Only the outer skin of the tree remains, but the branches and trunks are strong, and the flowers have six petals, which is a rare sight. Next to the temple is the tomb of the late painter and calligrapher Anji Wu Changshuo. The tombstone and inscription were written by Dai Jitao, the former president of the Examination Yuan.</p>
<p>The plum forest of Guanshengyuan is also here, which is the origin of the raw materials for Chenpi plums. To the west of the mountain is the Dragon Cave. The depth of the cave is indistinguishable. Upon entering the cave, one hears the sound of ten thousand horses galloping, or the sound of angry waves, so no one has explored it to the end. It is said that it can lead to the Qiantang River, and it will be blocked at the time of Hongyang. Next to Chao Mountain is the Hangtang Highway, which leads directly to Hangzhou, with a branch road to Linping, making transportation very convenient. After the war, ruins are everywhere, and people are struggling to survive. The scenic area has been transformed into a land of Shura. Since the road has been closed for several years, travelers travel by small boats. However, there are many special troops on the waterway, who check and make things difficult, and robberies are often heard. There is a state of "talking about tigers turning pale."</p>

The results of the inspection have been reported to the Ministry of Finance in accordance with Article 18 of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions, ordering them to be punished separately with suspension of business and fines. It is estimated that five banks, including Yongkang Yongfeng, have committed serious offenses and will have their licenses revoked and their business liquidated. Eleven banks and money houses, including Jinde, will be temporarily suspended from business and will undergo internal reorganization before submitting a review to the office and reporting to the ministry for approval to resume business. Nineteen banks and money houses, including China Huimin, will be fined separately and will report on the thorough improvement of their internal affairs. It is reported that the five banks, including Yongkang, and the eleven banks and money houses, including Jinde, have stopped accepting new deposits and loan business since yesterday (12th) after receiving the order. They will continue to handle the collection and payment of previous loans and customer funds, and the negotiable instruments will be temporarily exchanged as usual to complete the settlement with legal procedures, and the correspondents will not be affected.</p>
<h3>Cotton Control Association Handles Registration of Provincial and Municipal Yarn Factories; Yarn Factories Not in Associations Must Apply</h3>

All power-driven textile factories within the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Huaihai, and within the special city districts of Nanjing and Shanghai, which have not joined the Textile Trade Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, or the Japanese Textile Trade Association in China, must apply for registration to the association before the deadline, or they will be subject to punishment according to the temporary regulations. The registration forms have been prepared.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Are Stirring in the Pacific; Japanese Army Is Fully Prepared; Military Commentator Analyzes the War Situation</h3>
<p>A military commentator in this city recently made a detailed analysis of the recent trends of the enemy American and British forces in the Pacific as follows:</p>
<h3>Enemy America Is Preparing for the Next Operation</h3>
<p>The enemy's mobile unit's carrier-based aircraft attacked Tokyo, Japan, this time. Looking at its attempt, it seems to be a prelude to an island-hopping operation, while hoping to blockade Japan. We are currently unable to immediately judge what the enemy's purpose is, but the enemy is preparing a land force of more than ten divisions, and there is no doubt that they will take action sooner or later. In the future, where the enemy America's forces move can give a glimpse of the direction they are following. For example, the enemy mobile unit that is currently attacking Tokyo, according to the enemy's announcement, has four aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and fourteen destroyers. Under these circumstances, the enemy first engages a part of the naval force in stirring, which can be regarded as the prelude to the enemy's next operation.</p>
<h3>Changing to McWhorter's Tactics</h3>
<p>Since the Battle of Okinawa came to an end, the enemy's personnel changes have been frequent, and the changes in the organization of the army, navy, and air force are particularly noteworthy. For example, the enemy recently dispatched a new engineer corps to Okinawa to carry out construction. It is believed that the vanguard war between the Japanese and American armies has become increasingly fierce. According to a Delhi telegram on the 10th of this month, according to a report from Washington, a vast civil engineering project has recently been launched in Okinawa to build a powerful air base, and the activity of its workers and equipment exceeds more than twice that of Europe and the Mediterranean. According to the announcement of the enemy's Pacific Fleet Command in Omiya Island on the 11th of this month, all US Army Air Force units based in the Ryukyu Islands are under the command of McWhorter. The enemy's Air Force has been redeployed again and again, such as McWhorter's Chief of Staff and Mobile Aviation Commander George Kenney, in addition to controlling the 5th and 13th Air Forces, also serves as the 7th Air Force, which used to be stationed in mainland China. As for the tactics used by the enemy, in the past, the enemy established bases in Ryukyu and the Mariana Islands to attack Japan, which was nothing more than Nimitz's tactics, but now they have abandoned Nimitz's tactics and switched to McWhorter's tactics. Although the British and American sides are actively preparing, such as launching a large-scale war against Japan and the mainland, it cannot be realized, because the preparation of ships and troops is not enough to cope with it.</p>
<h3>Japan Has Long Been Fully Prepared</h3>
<p>The enemy's troop strength in Europe, we expect to be able to move to the Pacific in November of this year. It will take until April of next spring for all the troop strength in Europe to be fully moved. Recently, McWhorter also said that the war will end by the end of next year. In Japan, such as dispersing factories to strengthen the production of underground factories, etc., Japan has long been fully prepared, especially maintaining the limit of aircraft, which will definitely not be a problem. In addition, such as the fortification of the mainland, the armed unity of 100 million people, and the supply of troops in mainland China, etc., in the future, in fact, the enemy's dreams and attempts will be shattered without residue. According to the enemy's announcement, although the United States has destroyed a lot of Japanese bases in Okinawa alone, the number of Japanese production has been minimal. Although it has repeatedly investigated the production sites and storage sites of Japanese aircraft, there is no trace, so the tactical bombing of the mobile unit is of no avail, so it feels quite uneasy. This point can better express that Japan's underground production and underground storage are extremely rich.</p>
<h3>British Forces in the Far East Are Not Fighting Effectively</h3>
<p>The recent battle in Balikpapan can be said to have reached the decisive stage. In the future, British forces will invade from Malaysia, Thailand, and the East Indies, which is imaginable. Other examples include the Chongqing army's invasion of the Vietnamese border and McWhorter's invasion of Borneo. The launch of the Southeast Asian army and the East Indian Ocean Fleet is inevitable. However, after investigating the British troops' operations in the Far East, they are only engaged in propaganda and not in actual combat. For example, in the Yangon area of Myanmar, the British army is still engaged in fierce battles with the Thai army in Bago. The fact that US Representative Allett accused the UK of not being sincere in fighting the Pacific War, and of only engaging in expanded propaganda, shows the ineffectiveness of the UK in combat.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Trade Association Scheduled to Be Established</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special City Edible Oil Trade Association has been gradually completed since the preparation began. The association is scheduled to be established in late July, and a general membership meeting will be convened to elect directors and supervisors. In addition, the membership registration handled by the association will be closed tomorrow (14th) and will not be extended. Whether they are members of the Shanghai District Association or edible oil operators who have not joined the former District Association, they must register, otherwise their membership will be waived.</p>
<h3>Interbank Lending by Interbank Association and Money House Reserve Increases Frequently</h3>
<p>The credit union of the banks and money houses in the city, the loan limit for interbank lending, although the amount has been relaxed once, the restriction on high-amount loans is not cancelled, in order to show the consistent rights of basic members and fair adjustment. It is reported that for this loan, if a bank or money house needs it within the limit, it can apply at any time with full collateral, but for special needs, it must attach an application form, stating the purpose and reasons for the need, before it can be processed. The purpose of the lending籌碼is to adjust the necessities of the business of the industry, and all improper needs will be rejected. It is reported that the number of loans from the two industry association reserves has increased significantly recently, but they are all within the limited amount. The total reports of loans from various banks and money houses are also sent to the Central Reserve Bank Financial Inspection Office on schedule.</p>
<h3>Gold Securities Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold securities due and the fourth installment were slightly lower than the previous day. The prices are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Due bonds: 3,600,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan, down 75,000 yuan. Fourth-term bonds: 3,540,000 yuan, down 55,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Limited Price for Large Pancakes and Fried Dough Sticks: 300 Yuan Per Piece</h3>
<p>The Price Review Committee continues to approve the limited price for large pancakes and fried dough sticks. The price of each large pancake is 300 yuan, and there must be no less than ten per catty. The price of each fried dough stick is 300 yuan, and there must be no less than sixteen per catty.</p>
<h3>Group Purchase of Miscellaneous Grains; Hope for Prompt Payment; Civil Food Regulation Committee Notifies All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Civil Food Regulation Committee of this city has decided to purchase miscellaneous grains in groups to enrich civil food. The first phase of the purchase method has been announced in various newspapers. The participation is extremely enthusiastic. Now, in order to facilitate the participation of all sectors, the main points of the method are listed again:</p>
<p>All factories, shops, schools, hospitals, cultural and other institutions and groups can participate in the group independently and directly. Every 20 people can subscribe for one unit. Each institution or group is limited to 20 units. Each unit pays a purchase fund of 500,000 yuan. Individuals can join the institutions and groups they serve.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains are mainly wheat flour. The purchase work is entrusted to the Flour and Wheat Control Committee to be responsible for guaranteeing safety.</p>
<p>The purchase period is about one and a half months. After the miscellaneous grains arrive in Shanghai, they will be issued as soon as they arrive. Participants can collect them at the designated location with their payment receipts in the order of payment. The collection date will be announced in the news in various newspapers at any time.</p>
<p>The payment location is Fuxing Bank and its branches. The deadline for collection is July 15. Payment by bank draft is also acceptable.</p>
<p>The price of miscellaneous grains and transportation costs are shared equally by the participants. At the end of the first phase of the purchase, the closing accounts will be publicly reported.</p>
<p>According to this group's purchase of miscellaneous grains, it is purely to regulate civil food and suppress grain prices. The procedures for participating in the purchase and collecting miscellaneous grains are extremely simple. Now the deadline for collection is approaching, so please have the participating groups pay as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Members of the Civil Food Regulation Committee: Zhu Boquan, Hu Zewu, Li Siyi, Liu Xingchen, Dai Yilu, Xiang Yuankang, Sun Yaodong, Jin Xiong, Bai Chenbin, He</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Scholarships; Hope from Supported Students</h3>
<p>For things that are of vital importance to me, I will do them myself, and the results will be great. I remember the last "Special Fundraising" event. We were actually encouraging the student community to fundraise automatically. Sure enough, when we called out, the crowd responded, and students from universities and middle schools came out one after another, either raising several teams in one class, or raising several teams in one school. The total donations were considerable. In less than a month, the goal was achieved, so the scholarship work last year was a complete success, and everyone was happy!</p>
<p>This newspaper currently has 3,700 students receiving aid. In addition to the more than 600 elementary school students who are young and weak, the remaining 3,000 children are all energetic and lovely. Their own families are indeed poor, but there is no shortage of enthusiastic and wealthy families among their relatives and friends. If each person raises a team, using the "collective recognition method," each person can raise 120,000 yuan, and five or six people can form a team of 100,000 yuan. Isn't it possible to realize these 3,000 ordinary teams? During the summer vacation, I hope everyone will come to the office to collect forms and fundraise from relatives and friends. This is something that is of vital importance to me. I will not complain or resent, but will do it myself!</p>
<p>Old students, please note that this morning from 9:00 to 10:30, assisted students in the second and third grades of junior high school will come to the office to collect the student status certificate and application form. Do not miss it. This office is open.</p>
<h3>Festival Celebration Funds Award Scholarships for the Poor</h3>
<p>Huazhong Water and Electricity Company wrote: "Your museum is holding scholarships, benefiting young people, which is admirable. Our company is contributing 1 million yuan for the seventh anniversary of its founding as scholarships to award and assist poor students. Half of the money, 500,000 yuan, is sent to your museum for inspection and collection, and distribution. The remaining 500,000 yuan will be sent to the Xinwen Bao newspaper. A small amount of money is intended to help cultivate talents."</p>
<h3>Ordinary Teams</h3>
<p>Team 23: Chui Zhong Water and Electricity Company Team, quickly advanced 500,000 yuan, total of 5,909,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Received Aid: Anonymous (receipt 8977) 33,000 yuan, Shen Yunhai 4,000 yuan, totaling 37,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Various Commercial Banks to Resume Remittances</h3>
<p>This city's banking industry, realizing that past business development has not followed the right track and needs improvement, now understands that major commercial banks are preparing to resume remittance business, starting with remittances to various provinces and cities in Central China. The remittance handling fees and exchange rates will be revised according to current needs, and it is expected to be realized in the short term.</p>

<h3>### Changzhou Fellow Townsmen Association Subsidizes Fellow Townsmen to Return Home</h3>

It is now reported that the association is assisting in the evacuation. Those truly impoverished fellow townsmen who lack means to return to their hometown can also apply for aid.
