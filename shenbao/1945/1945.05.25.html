<h3 id="c21">日本海軍魂（其二） <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>四十年前日本海海戰之決勝力，就是日本的「海軍魂」·四十年後之今日，太平洋戰爭之決戰力，仍舊是日本的「海軍魂」。</p>
<p>在這次戰爭中，日本海軍於一九四一年十二月八日奇襲夏威夷的珍珠灣美基地，予敵美對鎖日本的陰謀以劈頭的打擊，激起了全世界的震驚，改變了太平洋地圖的顏色，保障了大東亞各國和各民族的解放，當時的日本海軍力，和英美合併的海軍力作戰，在理論上是很困難的，但是事實反駁了理論，日本英勇地躍進戰爭而且獲得空前的勝利，這正是日本「海軍魂」的表現！</p>
<p>日木「海軍魂」不只在一九四一—四二年的勝利中表現，而且也在一九四二年以後至一九四四年的戰略相持階段中充分的表現出來。第一個表現海軍魂之偉大的是山本五十六元帥，他早在以一少尉候補生而服務之時，已秉承了東鄉元帥以下光榮的海軍魂傳統，而曾表示過「死於勤務之地，乃爲最善之死」。當軍縮預備會議在倫敦舉行之時，這位山本中將於一九三五年元旦的朝日新聞上發表一文，述其參加日俄戰爭之經騐，說當時—正是五月廿七日那天，破片傷了他的脚，奪其左手二指，一剎那間感到「人，在動務之地，作最善之努力，此理之至當也，敵毫無不安之感！」三十餘年來未稍變其信念。他這種海軍魂，後於在三十八年後至一九四三年四月，在指揮作戰的第一綫「盡其最善的努力」而成仁！</p>
<p>綱山本元帥起而到太平洋第一綫赴任日本艦隊總指揮的古賀元帥，更毫無愧色地繼承了山本元帥的遺志，他在拜命之後立即表明其決心：「當偕山本元帥以下幾多在天之英靈，以求敵必殺，完成護國之大任」。而以「職分奉公」「部署死守」訓示其麾下全軍。誠如高橋海軍大將所說：「古賀司令長官，對常時太平洋上之全般作戰指導，具有非常之能力與　見，不愧爲最適當的第二個山本」。而其「擊滅仇敵之心必須永銘全軍心腑」，終於在第一綫上繼山本元帥而爲國捐軀，這種「古賀精神」，更堪與「東鄉精神」匹敵而爲日本「海軍魂」之高度的發揚。</p>
<p>現在敵人以隊洲戰爭結束，正在夢想移師東來，而展開了新的封鎖攻略。這種封鎖攻略，常然比四十年前俄國艦隊及四年前英美荷軍力之封鎖，比較嚴重，但是，敵人恰巧漠視了浸透於日本民族之精神的力量—這種偉大的「海軍魂一，却是任何物質的力量所不能封鎖和壓服的。自豐田日本海國總司令長官以下，以至神風特攻隊的每一個日本靑年將士，那種「見敵必摧」，以一己之犧牲而救護社國爲最高無上之偸快的「海軍魂」，却是東方民族無敵的典型，而爲白種人尤其是英美帝國主義者所不能夢想的。</p>
<p>我們深信，在日本「海軍魂」的高度發揮之下，太平洋的一切敵人，將定上最後的絕路。</p>
<h3 id="c22">冲繩敵軍　陷於極度困難　軍事評論空觀測戰局 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>據本市軍事評論家就最近太平洋戰局及歐洲政同情勢，加以觀測。茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>奄美日軍防禦堅强</p>
<p>奄美大島日軍防禦堅强，最近敵以艦載機犯襲，當經日守衛部隊强烈攻擊，業已竄逃無蹤。在冲繩島之東北方，有敵機動部隊艦桓，以正規航空母艦二艘，制式航空母艦四艘，作為基幹，蓋此機動部隊既無船團之援助，不能發揮新的作戰。當今敵在冲繩島南部之作戰，陷於　着狀態，日軍方面敵爲防範該方而海上日軍之登陸起見，特遣派該總</p>
<p>所謂在冲繩木島週團之敵機動部隊若干，及艦艇若干，經日特攻隊之邀擊，已受嚴重損害，即如在冲繩敵之陸上戰鬥，依然呈膠着狀態，敵屢次將兵力作總攻擊之舉，冀望打開戰局，且以艦砲及航機之轟炸，朱克奏效，由於日軍之强烈攻擊，敵之實力已逐漸被擊滅中，故敵在戰力上，深感困難。</p>
<p>在冲繩南部之陸上戰鬥，非常激烈，尤其在中部首里之前面一帶，因日軍之防禦堅强，敵人之企圖被挫，不能達到目的，同時該方面連日在霉雨季節，致使敵在當初之作戰企圖，不能實現，陷於非常困難之中。</p>
<p>呂宋前綫戰鬥猛烈</p>
<p>關於呂宋島方面戰况，在卡加巴拉山脈至加牙茵溪谷，及爲尼刺東方至怡保之二戰綫，仍展開猛烈戰鬥，而敵美之出血頗爲嚴重。據本月二十二日麥克沃塞司令部發表，美第二十五步兵師團副團長陶爾登代將，在呂宋前綫陣亡，故在呂宋島之日美兩軍戰鬥，自開戰至今，為時已半載，刻仍在激烈戰鬥中，日軍之勇猛作戰，已發揮無遺。同時已反映美軍之大量出血，及戰爭已陷於長期化。當初敵方企圖在呂宋作戰解決後，擬將兵力增强赴北方作戰，故在當前敵之戰局中，已發現頗大之錯誤。</p>
<p>次如民大之南部諸島，襲羅洲之泰拉干，緬甸及仰光之週圍，均有織機戰鬥，之而敵方出血繼續擴大，已受極大之損害。</p>
<p>美渝意見不能協調</p>
<p>其次世界政局方面，查舊金山會議當初之目的，以確立運用戰後世界政治爲原則，但此項目標，在今日已告喪失殆盡。現在所得者，僅僅安全保障機構，不外爲國際法之方式，效果頗爲徴小，此項狹隘之安全保障機構，在南北美洲·東亞·歐濟每一地域，難以適用，如今已引起重大問題，意見不能一致。</p>
<p>前傳渝代表宋子文將經莫斯科返渝，嗣後宋巳於十八日從華盛頓返至舊金山，在此一週中，宋在會議中進行擔任團長一職，其間宋因美渝之意見，不能協調，進行折衝，故其間意義，殊令人莫測。</p>
<p>對日作戰問題頗多</p>
<p>在敵方之國內政治情形，歐洲戰局在軍事上告一段落之今日，敵國內一股人深感即將降臨和平觀念，一般爲政者，亦具有頗多之幻想，因此在對日本艦續戰上，雖見有再三之發明，其實有頗多問題在蘊臓發生着。雖歐戰結束，國內之紛爭，各黨各派即將抬頭，陷於紛爭狀態，故繼續對日作戰之前途，頗成問題。</p>

<h3 id="c26">海島作戰的特殊性 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>巴東指揮下的美軍第三軍，在歐洲登陸最初進攻巴黎的時候，在諾曼第平原上並未等待後續部隊，一直就衝向巴黎，這在戰術上看來，簡直是不合道理的挺進。美國聯合社記者曾大聲疾呼，警告此種情形為「無桿的槍頭攻入法」，然而以坦克車為主的這一機械化部隊，終於衝進巴黎城。當時槍桿並不在地上，而是在空中。從空中補充，這就等於制空權是槍桿二能　樣充分表示出近代戰特色者，只要看看大東亞戰爭的實例，就可以知道敵美不顧一切的反攻，而是使用具有天空桿把的槍頭刺向前來的。</p>
<p>尼米資由馬金島，塔拉瓦島跳入馬紹爾島，又一躍而入塞班島及硫黃島，終於取得了日本就近的航空基地，這都是為了爭取制空權這一個目的的「拋標槍　戰法」。該地對壘的戰爭形式，業已被美國式戰術完全打破了。現在的戰爭，往往是由一個點向一個點的飛躍，即戰略要點的爭奪戰。在這一方面，可以看到海島作戰的特殊性。</p>
<p>全力作戰</p>
<p>奪取日本本土最近的航空基地，這就是急燥的美國反攻企圖。敵美佔領了塞班島，便作成B29轟炸日本本土的主要根據地。進一步又佔領了硫黃島，實在等於日本交給美國P51型侵略日本的基地。毫不喘息的敵美，又在冲繩島登陸了。這就是說，　單靠塞班島硫黃島之類的片面轟炸基地，是難以期待展開雄大空軍威力的。敵人欲想展開雄大的空軍威力，欲想澈底炸毀日本本土，則另一方向的進攻路綫是絕對需要的。這就是展開冲繩島作戰的目的。由此看來，美國所希望者，乃是想把海島作成基地。然則敵美爲爭取這一基地，究竟派來多少兵力及何種武裝呢？</p>
<p>按敵方發表，硫黃島登陸所必要的兵力，海軍六萬人，艦艇八百艘（兵員二十二萬）；仁牙因　登陸時，曾使用艦艇一千零三十三艘；慶良間羣島登陸時的機動部隊，爲航空母艦十五艘，戰艦十一艘，巡洋艦十艘，驅逐艦三十二艘，共六十八艘。</p>
<p>艦戰砲射擊的威力非常大，因爲一艘戰鬥艦的火力，實際等於五個師團的火力，可以等於一千兩百架日本雙引擎輕轟炸機的炸力·一艘巡洋艦，等於一個十生的砲發，三百二十五架輕轟炸機；一艘驅逐艦等於兩個十二生的榴彈砲連，六十九架輕轟炸機。據說冲繩作戰，敵人曾動員了太平洋上所有的艦隊。但日本的神風特別攻擊隊，至四月十七日爲止，曾擊沉十三艘航空母艦，十艘戰鬥艦，才九艘巡洋艦，六艘驅逐艦。這就是等於使一千架飛機葬身海底，按火力說，也就是等於毀滅了五十多個師團。這個數字，如再加算上日本戰鬥艦，或巡洋艦，航空母艦所收到的戰果，當然還要大得多。然而敵人並不因此而氣餒，仍然向冲繩戰境上大量地拋入戰力，以求決以勝負。海島作戰如果說是決定於兵力，戰力，國力等拋入的多少，則敵人一定會把最後的戰力也會拋入的。自然，日本也必須在冲權決戰上拋入所有的力量。</p>
<p>基地與空母</p>
<p>取得是飛機優勢」，就是決定制空權的關鍵，這是自然的道理。然而飛機的量，並不直接決定空戰勝負。現在不要忽略一個決定性要素的基地條件。冲繩戰塲尚未決定制空　誰屬問題。為了補救這一點，敵人才在伊江島登陸。這就是企圖由航空母艦轉到地上基地去。就是說，特攻機爲主體的日本航空部隊握有冲繩本島制空權，航空母艦爲主要滑走路的敵美握有之制空權，互爲勝負的現在，敵人總是焦燥於取得基地的主導權。地上基地與航空母艦在戰略與戰術上的優劣，按現階段的空戰形勢說，尚不能斷定。正好像一個在坡上一個在坡下相互拋石塊打仗一樣。坡上是指佔優勢的地上基地，但下面拋出的石塊比上面拋出的石塊多時，則坡下的人就會有利。航空母艦的兵力比地上基地在飛機和炸彈的量上都佔優勢的話，或者成爲二者戰力相等，成者超過基地機能。</p>
<p>在冲繩戰塲上，現在敵人空母艦的力量雖然不能制勝日本，於是敵人就想在伊江島登陸，以取得地上基地。敵美爲確保制空權，而愈益採取最後手段了。</p>
<p>補充決戰</p>
<p>最後决定者，就是補充。决定空戰有六個基本要素。即發，質，補充，基地，飛行員的質，以及情報。這六個要棄中最主要者，可以說是補充。勝利的一切耍素，都要求補充。龐大的消耗，自然需要補充。尤其空戰上的補充，可以說是絕對性的。</p>
<p>敵人對冲繩瘋狂的進攻，就是敵人拖長了補充路程。冲繩距離美國有一萬公里之遙。每一名美國兵，十天約需十六噸食糧及彈藥。美國在冲繩島有七個師的人數登陸，按這一數字來計算其消耗的彈藥及食糧噸數，起碼恐怕也得一百十萬噸。這樣就需要五千噸的貨船兩百艘。襲美爲這種運輸，每月必須在美國及冲繩島間往來三次。但敵人在冲繩島周圍，業已喪失了六十多艘運輸船。敵美的補充，業已陷於苦　泥沼。但日本的補充，非常的容易，因爲距離日本</p>
<p>僅一衣帶水。</p>
<p>補充戰對於日本是絕對有利的。戰爭一定有一方失敗的，這因爲有補充的挫折。我們日本無論如何在冲總决戰上，不要發生補充的挫折。</p>
<p>特攻隊</p>
<p>特攻隊的出擊，打破了對過去制空權的認識。在敵美制空權不，特攻隊不顧一切地一直飛出去了。擾亂了敵人的制空權，於是敵人積極向航空母艦上補充夜問戰鬥機，企圖保體制空權，但徒心勞日絀而已。美國量大的制空權論，在特攻隊的一擊前面，而失掉威嚴了。</p>
<p>爲求給敵人以致命的打擊，則向國民要求，努力製造特攻隊的量。只要握有特攻隊的量，則冲繩島上的制空權，可勿作杞人之憂。（譯自五月一日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c39">開發洞庭西山 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 湯毅</p>
<p>疏散準備</p>
<p>洞庭西山自經指定爲滬市人口疏散地區以後，各種準備，着着推進。江蘇省政府爲全力協助起見，第一步由吳縣縣政府更調得力和合作的區長。新區長金自荻君，熟悉當地情形，頗得駕輕就熟之效。目前正在進行中的工作，據疏散委會蘇州辦事處宜佈，有下列數項：</p>
<p>訓練自衛隊：目前洞庭西山的治安情形，從大體觀察，可設十分平靖，新區長爲加強人民自衛力量，更着手組織壯丁，又在夜間組設巡邏隊，更預備進一步將當地五千煤礦工人，組織訓練，將來疏散者遷來以後，安全問題，可以無憂。</p>
<p>積儲糧食：洞庭西山孤立太湖中，因當地不產糧食，一旦外界交通受了進響，民食難免恐慌，因此現正由區公所領導備積糧食運動，以經常準備兩個月所需的米麥雜糧爲目標。</p>
<p>登記房屋：疏散委員會的洞庭西山分辦事處，已在區公所及鄉鎭長的合作之下，登記常地民屋，限定每戶有幾口，祗能使用若干房屋，逾此限度，必須照官定的公正價格，出租予疏散者。道種登記，預料於本月底可以完成。</p>
<p>建設計劃</p>
<p>在蘇省當局的援助之下，疏散工作的各項困難，正在一一迎刃而解。最成爲問題，也最引起一般人焦慮的，倒是疏散到洞庭山後的工作安播問題。</p>
<p>記得項康原氏提議　洞庭山爲疏散區之初，便會指出疏散一事，不能僅視爲「逃難」的積極行爲，而應當作移　上海一部分人力物力，在當地作永久牲的開發建設連動。江蘇省當局對此也十分重視，正在硏究計劃。</p>
<p>試觀洞庭西山的環境，可以知道上述的閒發工作，不是沒有前途的。該山地廣人稀，空隙的地面很多，特別値得重視的，是礦產蘊藏量極爲　富，如果以之爲小型工廠的疏散區，學校區，或住宅區，非當適當。</p>
<p>舉例以言，目前寶山寶成兩煤礦，用土法掘煤，尚且每月有三千噸的出產，按每噸十萬元計算，每月可產市値三萬萬元的煤斤，而每月的支出，聽說不到兩萬萬元，獲利甚薄。有了煤，動力發電便不成問題。一般工廠在開設時，往往選擇三種地方，不是原料產地，便是銷塲所在，不是鎖塲所在，便是燃料人力價格低廉的地方，洞庭西山的燃料既不生問題，人工因爲糧食比較低廉，較之都市自便宜得多，又據各方面調查，常地除煤以外，選有錢礦等金屬礦尚未開發，這是値得注意的第一點。</p>
<p>第二，當地的水路交通非常發達，四　都是糧食及農產品產地。如米麥，絲茶，漁產，都是江浙特產，以之爲原料而加工，極有希望；同時附近都是富庶之區，不乏銷納的市塲。</p>
<p>第三，洞庭西山是孤立的島嶼，治安核易維持，環境也樸實，工人，學生移到該地後，外界物質的引誘少，工作學習，自能專心，這一點，表面上似乎不關重要，實際上對於設廠開學校是値得攷慮的一點。</p>
<p>蘇省建設廳已擬就閒發洞庭西山的計劃，作爲自治模範區，準備將洞庭西山建設成戰前的香港一般，諸如建築船塲，輕便鐵道，閒設工廠等等。祇是資金問題，尚特設法，盼望滬上資力雄厚的實業家，踴躍投資，前途自無可限量。江蘇省政府，也正就廠址，治安，運輸等等，作種種準備，都是十分切實的援助。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Summons Aviation Industry Representatives to Hold Motivational Meeting; Prime Minister Suzuki Exhorts Production to Repay the Nation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government summoned over a hundred representatives from aviation industry companies in Tokyo for a motivational meeting held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 24th.  Government officials, including Prime Minister Suzuki and other ministers, attended, as well as industry figures such as Mr. Furukogata, Vice President of the Aviation Industry Association, and other representatives. Prime Minister Suzuki delivered a speech, followed by speeches from Military Supplies Minister Kata and Information Bureau President Shimomura regarding the "Urgent Task of Aircraft Production." Mr. Furukogata then delivered a response on behalf of the attendees, after which the meeting adjourned.  At 5:00 PM, a separate meeting was held regarding aircraft production, with Vice President of the Aviation Industry Association Kata, President of Nakajima Aviation Industry Kiyoichi, President of Aichi Aviation Aircraft Aoki, President of Kawasaki Aircraft Tanigawa, President of Kawanishi Aircraft, and others engaging in earnest discussions with the Prime Minister, the Army and Navy Ministers, the Director-General of the Air Force Arsenal, and the Director-General of the Air Force Ordnance Bureau, Hanamaki.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Prime Minister's Address <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Suzuki addressed the representatives of aviation industry companies at the motivational meeting, with the gist as follows:  Today, the situation on Okinawa Island and in the entire war zone has reached a critical point of fierce fighting for every inch of land. The intense battles have continued unabated, and we now face the most severe military situation.  Besides expressing our gratitude for the spirit of the loyal and valiant special attack forces, we also hope that the people in the rear will inherit the fighting spirit of the frontline special attack forces and dedicate themselves to production and defense. The current war situation demands not only the vigorous morale of our soldiers but also three-dimensional warfare that combines the essence of modern science, with aircraft at its core, to determine the key to victory or defeat.  We urgently need to urge the aviation industry warriors to rise up and strive to make the war situation favorable. The most fundamental requirement for increased aircraft production is the enthusiasm, that is, the fighting spirit, of the industry warriors.  However, since the recent major air raids, the attendance rate of industry warriors at factories has noticeably declined, which is truly regrettable. Recently, a certain factory in the Kansai region was bombed by enemy aircraft, resulting in a tragic loss of life.  However, the attendance rate at the factory the next day reached 100%. I was deeply moved upon receiving this report. This is an example of steadfastly guarding one's workplace.  The aviation industry in which you are engaged is the highest comprehensive industry in our country, and this industry encompasses all levels of society. The factory is a microcosm of society, and you, who bear the responsibility for production, are not only responsible for a company or a factory but also for society and are its leaders.  You should deeply understand this principle, step forward in the factories, and strive to serve the nation.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – In the southern part of Okinawa Island, enemy forces have been gradually reinforcing their troops to the front lines since the 19th of this month, strengthening their offensive posture. The enemy's attacks are primarily aimed at the eastern coast, with no major changes in the battle situation on the western coast.  From the 19th to the 22nd, the battle situation on the eastern coast was roughly as follows: The enemy advanced from the east side of Unadama Hill on the east coast, through Yonabaru, towards Amagoi Village. Japanese forces promptly counterattacked, engaging in fierce battles. The enemy's reinforcement and resupply efforts seem to be facing considerable difficulties due to the progress of the battle situation in that area.  Also, on the high ground west of Momohara, northeast of Shuri, 300 enemy soldiers attacked. North of the 50th Stone Ridge, 200 to 400 enemy soldiers, with 5 to 10 tanks as vanguard, attempted to invade Japanese positions. Fierce battles ensued.  Furthermore, west of Shuri and in the Makabi area, enemy land forces repeatedly attacked with numerous tanks, gradually pressing towards Japanese positions. A portion of the enemy forces in the Makabi area finally reached the south. From the overall battle situation, it appears that the enemy is currently attempting to break through Japanese positions in the eastern region in order to advance towards the rear of Shuri.</p>
<p>Nansei Islands Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – On the 22nd, Japanese air units attacked enemy warships near Okinawa. In the morning, they attacked enemy warships northeast of Kume Island, severely damaging one battleship. Among them, three vessels of unknown type were also heavily hit, but a definite assessment of the battle results has not yet been made.  Additionally, they attacked enemy warships around Ie Island, sinking one destroyer and one large cruiser.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on May 24th: Starting from around 1:30 AM on the 24th, for approximately two and a half hours, about 250 enemy B-29 aircraft from southern bases mainly intruded into Tokyo, carrying out indiscriminate bombing with incendiary bombs.  One annex building within the Imperial Tea House in the Miyagi Imperial Garden and the rear garden of the Akasaka Imperial Palace was burned down.  The fires that broke out in various parts of the city were almost completely extinguished by around 7:00 AM.  The results of the Japanese air defense units' interception, as confirmed, were 27 aircraft shot down and approximately 30 aircraft destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Approximately 250 enemy B-29 aircraft from bases in the Mariana Islands attacked Yokohama, Kawasaki, and various districts of Tokyo from around 1:30 AM on the 24th for about two hours, in dispersed formations of one or two aircraft, indiscriminately bombing urban areas with incendiary bombs, causing fires in several areas. The fires were completely extinguished before 5:00 AM. Japanese air and land units continuously shot down the attacking enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft that were hit burst into large fireballs and fell separately in the air.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Enemy activity against the Northern Chishima Islands has been quite active recently. At around 9:10 AM on the 20th, two enemy B-24 aircraft approached the northern entrance of the Horomushiro Strait from the east. After Japanese forces counterattacked, both enemy aircraft were severely damaged and retreated northeast. Subsequently, at around 4:30 PM that afternoon, seven enemy B-25 aircraft, divided into two groups of three and four, intruded into the airspace above Shumshu Island, strafing Japanese garrison positions with machine guns. Japanese forces immediately launched an aerial counterattack, shooting down four of them and destroying two on the ground with anti-aircraft fire. At around 6:30 PM that afternoon, the enemy again approached Horomushiro Island's Kataoka Bay with approximately five small vessels and attacked Japanese positions. Japanese forces immediately returned fire, repelling them after about 20 minutes of combat. Special attention should be paid to enemy movements in this foggy season.</p>

<p>Southern Front Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – Since the surprise attack on Zamboanga on February 20th, Japanese forces in New Guinea have continued their mopping-up operations against enemy forces retreating towards Mar. On a certain night and on a certain day, Japanese forces launched another surprise attack on enemy positions, destroying enemy encampments and inflicting heavy damage, causing a small number of remaining enemies to flee across the sea to Biak Island. Through this devastating blow by Japanese forces, the enemy forces have been driven back from the Mar Airfield area, and the Mar Airfield has been completely occupied. The enemy airfield on Biak Island was also attacked, rendering it unusable.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 24th (Central News Agency) – Japanese elite troops, in order to suppress enemy supply route bases in the Philippines and to attack Morotai Island, a stronghold in Davao, Tarakan, and the Southwest Pacific, have been constantly increasing pressure. On a certain day in May, they boldly carried out a counter-landing on the island, breaking through the enemy's three-dimensional torpedo boat alert network and courageously charging in. They engaged in several battles with the enemy's high-speed, superior torpedo boat squadron, crushing them. The landing of all Japanese soldiers was successfully completed.</p>

The King has authorized Prime Minister Churchill to dissolve the existing Parliament on June 15th in accordance with the Imperial Edict, based on the agreement formally signed by the leaders of the various parties in the House of Commons on January 17th. Currently, under the three major opposing political leaders, approximately 2,000 candidates are eagerly hoping to enter the political stage within six weeks. However, the central figures in this general election are only Churchill, the 70-year-old leader of the Conservative Party; Attlee, the 63-year-old leader of the Labour Party and Deputy Prime Minister of the Coalition Cabinet; and Sinclair, the 54-year-old British Air Minister (of the Liberal Party faction). According to current regulations, there are 640 seats in Parliament, and the Conservative Party has more than 500 candidates, nearly half of whom are military personnel. The Labour Party also has no fewer than 500 candidates, including a large number of women, while the Sinclair Liberal Party has only about 300 candidates.

<p>Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to information received here, the Labour Party, which may continue the Conservative Party's rule and preside over the government of the British Empire for the next five years, abruptly clarified the following four foreign policies yesterday: The British government will be the central organization of the British Empire and the British Commonwealth. Britain will never use small countries to check large countries. European issues should be resolved at the World Peace Conference. This foreign policy was drafted by Labour Minister Bevin, who once integrated with Prime Minister Churchill, at the Labour Party's annual conference held at Blackwater. The 1,100 Labour Party representatives attending the annual conference will unanimously use this policy as a talisman during the general election.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bevin solemnly stated in his speech: Regarding Germany, if we want to prevent Germany from redeveloping its war-making capabilities, we must make the most of the 60 million Germans. Regarding India, we must close the "India Office" and transfer the affairs it handles to the "Home Office." Regarding trade, the British Empire will certainly maintain certain preferential rights, and all countries can levy tariffs on trade with Britain.</p>
<p>Finally, Bevin expressed the following attitudes towards European countries: Regarding France, France has leaned towards the left, so only those on the left can understand the sentiments of the left. Regarding Italy, we Labourites must treat Italy again as we did when Mussolini was in power and Italy was strong. Regarding Poland, there may be fascists among the Poles, but none of the recently organized socialist parties have a fascist tinge.</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Japanese Naval Spirit (Part 2) <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The decisive force in the naval battle off Tsushima forty years ago was Japan's "Naval Spirit." Today, forty years later, the decisive force in the Pacific War is still Japan's "Naval Spirit."</p>
<p>In this war, the Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the U.S. base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 8, 1941, giving a head-on blow to the enemy's conspiracy to encircle Japan, shocking the world, changing the color of the Pacific map, and ensuring the liberation of various countries and peoples in Greater East Asia. At that time, the Japanese naval power was fighting against the combined naval power of Britain and the United States, which was theoretically very difficult. However, the facts refuted the theory. Japan bravely leaped into the war and achieved unprecedented victories, which is precisely a manifestation of Japan's "Naval Spirit"!</p>
<p>The Japanese "Naval Spirit" was not only manifested in the victories of 1941-42 but also fully demonstrated in the strategic stalemate stage from 1942 to 1944. The first person to demonstrate the greatness of the Naval Spirit was Marshal Isoroku Yamamoto. As early as when he was serving as a second lieutenant candidate, he had inherited the glorious Naval Spirit tradition of Marshal Tōgō and expressed that "dying in the line of duty is the best death." When the disarmament preparatory conference was held in London, Lieutenant General Yamamoto published an article in the Asahi Shimbun on New Year's Day in 1935, recounting his experiences in the Russo-Japanese War. He said that at that time, precisely on May 27th, a piece of shrapnel wounded his foot and took two fingers from his left hand. In an instant, he felt that "a person, in the line of duty, makes the best effort, which is the most appropriate principle, and the enemy has no sense of unease!" For more than thirty years, his belief has not changed slightly. This Naval Spirit of his later led him to "make his best effort" in the front line of commanding operations thirty-eight years later, in April 1943, and die for the country!</p>
<p>Marshal Yamamoto arose and proceeded to the Pacific frontline to take office as the commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet. Marshal Koga inherited Marshal Yamamoto's legacy without shame. Immediately after receiving his appointment, he expressed his determination: "I will accompany the many heroic spirits in heaven, including Marshal Yamamoto, to seek to surely kill the enemy and complete the great task of protecting the country." He instructed his entire army to "serve the public with duty" and "defend the deployment to the death." As Admiral Takahashi said, "Commander-in-Chief Koga has extraordinary ability and insight in guiding the overall operations in the Pacific at all times and is worthy of being the most appropriate second Yamamoto." His "heart to destroy the enemy must be forever engraved in the hearts of the entire army" finally led him to sacrifice his life for the country on the front line, following Marshal Yamamoto. This "Koga Spirit" is even comparable to the "Tōgō Spirit" and is a high expression of the Japanese "Naval Spirit."</p>
<p>Now, the enemy, with the end of the European war, is dreaming of moving troops east and launching a new blockade and strategy. This blockade and strategy is naturally more serious than the blockade by the Russian fleet forty years ago and the British, American, and Dutch military forces four years ago. However, the enemy has conveniently ignored the spiritual power that permeates the Japanese nation - this great "Naval Spirit," which cannot be blocked and suppressed by any material power. From General Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet, to every young Japanese soldier of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, that "must destroy the enemy upon sight," and the "Naval Spirit" of saving the country by sacrificing oneself as the highest and most supreme pleasure is an invincible model for the Eastern nation and something that white people, especially British and American imperialists, cannot dream of.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that with the high expression of the Japanese "Naval Spirit," all enemies in the Pacific will surely reach the final dead end.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Enemy Forces in Okinawa Fall into Extreme Difficulty: Military Commentary Aims to Observe the War Situation <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>According to military commentators in this city, after observing the recent war situation in the Pacific and the European political situation, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>**Amami Island Defenses are Strong**</p>
<p>The Japanese defenses on Amami Oshima are strong. Recently, the enemy attacked with carrier-based aircraft, but they were strongly attacked by the Japanese garrison and fled without a trace. Northeast of Okinawa Island, there is an enemy mobile fleet, based on two regular aircraft carriers and four escort aircraft carriers. However, this mobile fleet lacks the support of convoys and cannot launch new operations. The enemy's operations in the southern part of Okinawa Island are in a state of stalemate. The Japanese forces are sending troops to guard against enemy landings in that area.</p>
<p>The enemy mobile fleet and warships around Okinawa Island have suffered serious damage from attacks by Japanese special attack forces. The land battles on Okinawa are also at a standstill. The enemy has repeatedly launched general offensives, hoping to break the deadlock, and used naval gunnery and aerial bombardment, but with little effect. Due to strong Japanese resistance, the enemy's strength is gradually being depleted, and they are experiencing great difficulties in terms of combat power.</p>
<p>Land battles in southern Okinawa are fierce, especially in the area in front of Shuri in the central part of the island. Because Japanese defenses are strong, the enemy's plans have been thwarted and they cannot achieve their goals. At the same time, the rainy season has made it impossible for the enemy to realize their initial operational plans, putting them in a very difficult situation.</p>
<p>**Fierce Battles on the Luzon Front**</p>
<p>Regarding the war situation on Luzon Island, fierce battles continue along the Cagayan Valley and the two lines from east of Ipo. The American casualties are quite serious. According to a statement issued by General MacArthur's headquarters on the 22nd of this month, Lieutenant General Tornden, Deputy Commander of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division, was killed in action on the Luzon front. The battles between the Japanese and American forces on Luzon Island have been ongoing for half a year since the start of the war and are still fierce. The Japanese forces have displayed their bravery, which has resulted in heavy American casualties and the war has become protracted. The enemy initially intended to resolve the Luzon operation and then reinforce their forces for operations in the north. Therefore, a major error has been found in the enemy's current war strategy.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are weaving machine battles in the southern islands of Mindanao, Tarakan in Sulawesi, and around Burma and Rangoon. The enemy's casualties continue to increase significantly, and they have suffered extreme damage.</p>
<p>**U.S. and Chongqing Cannot Reconcile Their Views**</p>
<p>Regarding the global political situation, the original goal of the San Francisco Conference was to establish principles for managing postwar world politics, but this goal has been almost completely lost. All that has been achieved is a security assurance mechanism, which is merely a form of international law and has limited effectiveness. This narrow security assurance mechanism is difficult to apply in North and South America, East Asia, and Europe, and is causing significant problems and disagreements.</p>
<p>It was previously reported that the Chongqing representative, Song Ziwen, would return to Chongqing via Moscow. Subsequently, Song returned to San Francisco from Washington on the 18th. During that week, Song served as the head of the delegation at the conference. During that time, Song was trying to reconcile the irreconcilable differences between the U.S. and Chongqing. The meaning of this is quite unfathomable.</p>
<p>**Many Problems with the War Against Japan**</p>
<p>Regarding the domestic political situation in the enemy country, with the European war militarily concluded, some people in the enemy country deeply feel that peace is imminent. Government officials also have many illusions. Therefore, although there have been repeated announcements about continuing the war against Japan, there are actually many underlying problems. Even though the European war is over, domestic disputes will intensify and various factions will be in conflict. Therefore, the future of continuing the war against Japan is questionable.</p>

<h3 id="e30">The Uniqueness of Island Warfare <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. Third Army under Patton, when it initially landed in Europe and advanced toward Paris, did not wait for follow-up troops on the plains of Normandy but charged straight toward Paris. Tactically speaking, this was an unreasonable advance. A United Press reporter even warned loudly that this situation was "a gun barrel without a stock entering France." However, this mechanized unit, primarily composed of tanks, finally advanced into Paris. At the time, the gun stock wasn't on the ground; it was in the air. Replenishment from the air showed that air superiority was the gun stock. To understand the characteristics of modern warfare, one only needs to look at the examples of the Greater East Asia War to see that the enemy, the Americans, disregarded everything in their counterattack and used a "gun barrel with a sky stock" to thrust forward.</p>
<p>Nimitz jumped from Makin Island and Tarawa Island to the Marshall Islands, then leaped to Saipan and Iwo Jima, finally obtaining air bases close to Japan. All of this was for the purpose of securing air superiority, a "javelin-throwing" strategy. This form of head-to-head warfare has been completely broken by American tactics. Current warfare often involves leaps from one point to another, a battle for strategic points. In this respect, one can see the uniqueness of island warfare.</p>
<p>**All-Out Warfare**</p>
<p>Seizing air bases closest to the Japanese mainland is the goal of the impatient American counterattack. After the enemy Americans occupied Saipan, it became a major base for B-29 bombers to attack the Japanese mainland. Furthermore, the occupation of Iwo Jima was equivalent to Japan handing over a base for American P-51s to invade Japan. Without pausing for breath, the enemy Americans landed on Okinawa. This means that it is difficult to expect to deploy a large-scale air force using only one-sided bombing bases like Saipan and Iwo Jima. If the enemy wants to deploy a large-scale air force and completely destroy the Japanese mainland, then another line of attack is absolutely necessary. This is the purpose of the Okinawa operation. From this perspective, what the Americans want is to turn islands into bases. So, how many troops and what kind of weapons has the enemy sent to seize this base?</p>
<p>According to enemy announcements, the forces needed for the Iwo Jima landing were 60,000 sailors and 800 ships (220,000 personnel). During the Lingayen landing, 1,033 ships were used. The mobile fleet for the Kerama Islands landing consisted of 15 aircraft carriers, 11 battleships, 10 cruisers, and 32 destroyers, a total of 68 ships.</p>
<p>The firepower of naval gunnery is very great because the firepower of one battleship is actually equal to that of five divisions, which is equivalent to the bombing power of 1,200 Japanese twin-engine light bombers. One cruiser is equal to one ten-howitzer, 325 light bombers; one destroyer is equal to two twelve-howitzer batteries, 69 light bombers. It is said that for the Okinawa operation, the enemy mobilized all the fleets in the Pacific. However, the Japanese Kamikaze special attack forces, by April 17th, had sunk 13 aircraft carriers, 10 battleships, 9 cruisers, and 6 destroyers. This is equivalent to sending 1,000 aircraft to the bottom of the sea and, in terms of firepower, destroying more than 50 divisions. If one adds the results achieved by Japanese battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers, the number would certainly be much larger. However, the enemy is not discouraged by this and continues to pour troops into the Okinawa battlefield to fight to the finish. If island warfare is determined by the amount of troops, firepower, and national strength that is poured in, then the enemy will certainly pour in their final combat strength. Naturally, Japan must also pour all its strength into the decisive battle on Okinawa.</p>
<p>**Base and Aircraft Carrier**</p>
<p>"Gaining air superiority" is the key to deciding air control, which is a natural truth. However, the quantity of aircraft does not directly determine the outcome of air combat. Currently, one should not neglect the decisive factor of base conditions. The Okinawa battlefield has not yet decided who has air superiority. To remedy this, the enemy landed on Ie Island. This is an attempt to shift from aircraft carriers to land bases. In other words, the Japanese air force, mainly composed of special attack aircraft, holds air control over the main island of Okinawa, while the enemy Americans, with aircraft carriers as their main runways, hold air control. With victories and defeats alternating, the enemy is always anxious to gain control of the base. The strategic and tactical advantages and disadvantages of land bases and aircraft carriers, according to the current state of air combat, cannot be determined. It is like fighting by throwing stones at each other, one on a slope and one below. The slope represents the advantageous land base, but if the stones thrown from below are more numerous than the stones thrown from above, then the person below will have the advantage. If the strength of the aircraft carrier is superior to that of the land base in terms of the quantity of aircraft and bombs, then the combat power of the two will be equal or even exceed the base's capabilities.</p>
<p>On the Okinawa battlefield, even though the enemy's aircraft carrier strength cannot defeat Japan, they want to land on Ie Island to acquire a land base. The enemy Americans are increasingly resorting to desperate measures to secure air control.</p>
<p>**Replenishment Decisive Battle**</p>
<p>The final decision will be made by replenishment. There are six basic elements that determine air combat: attack power, quality, replenishment, bases, the quality of pilots, and intelligence. Among these six elements, the most important can be said to be replenishment. All the elements of victory require replenishment. Enormous consumption naturally requires replenishment. Replenishment in air combat, in particular, can be said to be absolute.</p>
<p>The enemy's frenzied attack on Okinawa means that the enemy has lengthened the replenishment route. Okinawa is 10,000 kilometers away from the United States. Each American soldier needs about 16 tons of food and ammunition every ten days. The United States has landed seven divisions of troops on Okinawa Island. Calculating the tonnage of ammunition and food consumed by this number, it will probably be at least 1.1 million tons. This would require 200 freighters with a capacity of 5,000 tons. For this transport, the enemy must travel between the United States and Okinawa three times a month. But the enemy has already lost more than 60 transport ships around Okinawa Island. The enemy's replenishment has already fallen into a quagmire. But Japan's replenishment is very easy because it is only a narrow strip of water from Japan.</p>
<p>The replenishment battle is absolutely advantageous to Japan. War will certainly lead to the failure of one side, and this is due to the frustration of replenishment. We, Japan, must not have replenishment setbacks in the final decisive battle on Okinawa, no matter what.</p>
<p>**Special Attack Force**</p>
<p>The sorties of the special attack forces have overturned the previous understanding of air control. Despite the enemy American control of the air, the special attack forces flew out without regard for anything. Disrupting the enemy's air control, the enemy then actively replenished night fighters on the aircraft carriers, attempting to maintain air control, but it was all in vain. The American theory of large-scale air control lost its authority in the face of the special attack force's attack.</p>
<p>In order to give the enemy a fatal blow, we ask the people to work hard to produce a quantity of special attack forces. As long as we have a quantity of special attack forces, then there is no need to worry about air control over Okinawa Island. (Translated from the May 1st Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Water and Electricity Company Hopes Citizens Will Voluntarily Conserve Water: Users Who Want to Adjust Limits Can Contact the Company <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The city's water supply problem has recently become quite serious, and various forces are paying close attention. The Shanghai Water Branch of the China Water and Electricity Company has issued a statement on the current water supply situation: After the implementation of water consumption limits, many users have exceeded their limits because they cannot voluntarily conserve water, resulting in fines. This is a passive warning method. Fines for exceeding water limits are specifically used for water supply construction. Because the general public does not fully understand the meaning of water fines, they repeatedly exceed the water consumption limits. The company's original intention in imposing fines was to encourage users to voluntarily conserve water in the future and avoid increasing fines, but the effect has been minimal. As summer approaches, the demand for water will gradually increase. If users need to adjust their limits due to actual needs, they can come to the company to negotiate. The company will absolutely accept opinions to find a solution. Because water supply is of great importance to people's livelihoods, the company is reluctant to cut off water to users who exceed their limits, but hopes that they will voluntarily make every effort to conserve water.</p>
<p>**Air Defense Headquarters Encourages Well Digging**</p>
<p>The City Air Defense Headquarters, in view of the fact that enemy aircraft are repeatedly invading Shanghai and water supply is likely to be interrupted at any time, and that water consumption is currently limited, making it difficult for citizens to obtain water, has taken measures to encourage residents to dig wells. It is stipulated that during the "Strengthened Air Defense Facilities Week" from June 1st to 9th, the cost of digging wells for citizens will be specially reduced, with each well costing approximately 300,000 national currency. The Rongxing Well Digging Company has been contacted and the matter is settled. It is hoped that citizens will respond to this call to make the city's air defense posture more perfect.</p>

<p>The City Government has repeatedly received petitions from citizens requesting the establishment of a Shanghai Poultry Market. Previously, it instructed the Economic Bureau to investigate and reply, stating that since the market had not been inspected by the bureau and its business operations had not been carried out in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Supervision of Privately Operated Markets, there were obvious legal discrepancies. Furthermore, it was found that during the preparation period of the market, it had been repeatedly accused by other businesses. Upon review of its articles of incorporation, it was found that most of the founders were outsiders to the industry, and that the business plan did not focus on procurement, transportation, and distribution of goods. The sole purpose was to collect handling fees and monopolize the market, which would not help to suppress commodity prices. There was absolutely no need to establish the market. The Economic Bureau was instructed to order the cessation of preparations and report to the Ministry of Industry for review. Now, citizens Zhang Hao and others have submitted a petition requesting permission to establish the market, but it is reported that the City Government has again rejected the request.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Developing Dongting West Mountain <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Yi</p>
<p>Evacuation Preparations</p>
<p>Since Dongting West Mountain was designated as an evacuation area for Shanghai's population, various preparations have been steadily progressing. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to fully assist, first transferred capable and cooperative district chiefs from the Wu County Government. The new district chief, Mr. Jin Zidi, is familiar with the local situation and is quite effective in handling matters. According to the Suzhou Office of the Evacuation Committee, the work currently underway includes the following:</p>
<p>Training Self-Defense Forces: The current security situation in Dongting West Mountain, from a general observation, can be considered very peaceful. The new district chief, in order to strengthen the people's self-defense capabilities, has started to organize able-bodied men and establish patrol teams at night. He is also preparing to further organize and train the local 5,000 coal miners, so that the safety of those who evacuate here in the future will be worry-free.</p>
<p>Stockpiling Food: Dongting West Mountain is isolated in Tai Lake. Because the area does not produce grain, once external transportation is affected, there will inevitably be panic about food. Therefore, the district office is currently leading a grain stockpiling campaign, with the goal of always preparing enough rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains for two months.</p>
<p>Registering Houses: The Dongting West Mountain Branch Office of the Evacuation Committee, in cooperation with the district office and township chiefs, has registered local houses, limiting each household to a certain number of people and allowing them to use only a certain number of houses. Beyond this limit, they must rent the excess houses to evacuees at a fair price determined by the government. This registration is expected to be completed by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Construction Plans</p>
<p>With the assistance of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, various difficulties in the evacuation work are being resolved one by one. The most problematic and worrying issue for most people is the problem of finding work and settlement after evacuating to Dongting Mountain.</p>
<p>It is remembered that when Mr. Xiang Kangyuan proposed Dongting Mountain as an evacuation area, he pointed out that evacuation should not be regarded merely as an active act of "fleeing disaster," but as a permanent development and construction undertaking, involving the relocation of part of Shanghai's human and material resources to the area. The Jiangsu Provincial Government also attaches great importance to this and is studying plans.</p>
<p>Looking at the environment of Dongting West Mountain, one can see that the aforementioned development work is not without a future. The mountain has a vast land and a sparse population, with many empty spaces. What is particularly noteworthy is that the mineral reserves are extremely rich. If it is used as an evacuation area for small factories, schools, or residential areas, it would be very suitable.</p>
<p>For example, the Baoshan and Baocheng coal mines currently use rudimentary methods to mine coal, but still produce 3,000 tons per month. At 100,000 yuan per ton, the monthly output is worth 300 million yuan, while the monthly expenditure is said to be less than 200 million yuan, resulting in a very small profit. With coal, power generation is not a problem. When establishing a factory, it is often necessary to choose one of three types of locations: the source of raw materials, the location of sales markets, or a place where fuel and labor costs are low. Dongting West Mountain's fuel is not a problem, and labor costs are much cheaper than in the city because food is relatively cheaper. According to various investigations, in addition to coal, there are also metal ores such as copper ore that have not yet been developed, which is the first point worth noting.</p>
<p>Secondly, the local waterway transportation is very developed, surrounded by areas that produce grain and agricultural products. Rice, wheat, silk, tea, and fishery products are all special products of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and it is very promising to process them as raw materials. At the same time, the nearby areas are all wealthy areas, with no shortage of sales markets.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Dongting West Mountain is an isolated island, easy to maintain security, and the environment is also simple. After workers and students move to the area, there is less external material temptation, and they can concentrate on work and study. This point may not seem important on the surface, but it is worth considering for establishing factories and schools.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department has drafted a plan to develop Dongting West Mountain as a model autonomous region, preparing to build Dongting West Mountain into a pre-war Hong Kong, such as building shipyards, light railways, and establishing factories. Only the problem of funds remains to be solved, and it is hoped that entrepreneurs with strong financial resources in Shanghai will actively invest, and the future will be unlimited. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is also making various preparations for factory sites, security, transportation, etc., which are all very practical assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Loan Fund for Medical Treatment: Two More Designated Hospitals Added <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>From the 23rd of last month to yesterday, within one month, 43 people were approved for loans from the Loan Fund for Medical Treatment, totaling 3,000,850 yuan, with the most being employees of industrial and commercial enterprises and teachers and students. All but one person who died have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. The designated hospitals have been particularly considerate to patients applying for loans, appropriately reducing medical expenses. In order to facilitate patients in the northern and western areas of Shanghai, the Shanghai Health Sanatorium on Wujin Road and the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital at 850 Xujiahui Road have been added as designated hospitals, and personnel are sent to the hospitals from time to time to express sympathy. Patients with the following qualifications can apply for loans:</p>
<p>Employees and technicians of factories and shops, teachers and staff of schools, internal affairs soldiers of post offices and customs, direct relatives and formal spouses of the above three types of personnel (unemployed persons with valid proof may also apply), students (limited to woodmen). Those who suffer from urgent internal medicine diseases and require urgent surgical operations, and are unable to afford medical treatment, can apply at the office located in the Xinzheng Industrial Company, Room 319, 3rd Floor, No. 89 Sima Road (intersection of Sichuan Road), from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily (excluding Sundays and holidays). In case of emergency that cannot be delayed, patients can first enter a designated hospital for treatment and complete the application procedures after obtaining a doctor's diagnosis.</p>

<p>Mr. Huang Lizheng, Zhang Jianhuang, Liang Xiaoyou, Xu Zhishan, and Huang Zhijie wrote: "The fire on Yuyao Road was a terrible disaster, with thousands of people homeless. Fortunately, your newspaper is enthusiastic about public welfare and has taken the lead in providing relief. We cannot shirk our responsibility and are willing to donate our weekly salaries, totaling 200,000 yuan, with 100,000 yuan donated to the Yuyao Road fire relief fund and another 100,000 yuan donated to your newspaper's 'Education Fund.' This is a small contribution, but it expresses our sincere intentions. We hope you will take this into consideration."</p>
<p>Charity Sale Profits Donated to Scholarship Fund</p>
<p>The Student Self-Government Association of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai wrote: "Your newspaper's establishment of free elementary schools has achieved very satisfactory results. It has indeed brought many benefits to society and the country! In addition to the students of our school each making efforts to save pocket money and successively donating to the charity school fund, several members of our association have also launched a charity market. The situation on the day of the event was quite enthusiastic. Everyone, based on the spirit of contributing money and goods, eventually made a net profit of 58,380 yuan. Although the amount is small, it expresses our enthusiasm. We hope that enthusiastic people in society will pay widespread attention and actively discuss and promote, so that the entire Shanghai can complete the network of charity schools, and then the days of eliminating the poor illiterate will come."</p>
<p>Wedding Confectionery Expenses Used to Aid Medical Fund</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Lu's family sent 200,000 national currency (Guo Bi), in order to save the expenses of wedding confectionery on the wedding of Mr. Lu Qizhuang and Ms. Hu Xingjue, and transferred it to the Small School Medical Aid Fund of this office. Mr. Lu's frugality in helping the good and benefiting the poor is of profound significance.</p>
<p>Extended Deadline for Lake County Hidden Poverty Loan</p>
<p>The Lake County Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai previously launched a hidden poverty loan, and the application period was set to end on the 22nd of this month. However, in recent days, fellow villagers have still been coming to the association to apply. In order to achieve universality, the application period has been extended to the afternoon of the 25th, and will not be extended any further. Hidden poor fellow villagers from Lake County in Shanghai can bring their residence permits to the association on the second floor of No. 263 Guizhou Road to apply.</p>
