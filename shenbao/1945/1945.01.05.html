<p>東京四日中央社電　日大本營四日下午三時發表：（一）神風特別攻擊隊，曾於三日晨在民答那峨海猛攻敵運輸船團，擊沉敵大型運輸船二艘，擊毀敵驅逐艦一艘。（二）日軍航空部隊，曾於三日黎明猛攻塞班昂敵機塲，炸碎數處，並使之起火。（三）日軍航空部隊，一月一日及二日之兩日間，連續猛炸槳霍塞，塔克羅　，塔拉克敵機塲，使其十三處起火，二處發生大爆炸。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日大本營門日發表神風特別攻擊隊及航空部隊戰果，茲誌其戰鬥經過如次：（一）日神風特別攻擊隊金剛隊，三日上午七時半許，猛攻民答那峨海上敵運輸船隊，其一架命中大型運輸船五艘，使之起火沉沒，一架命中大型運輸船一艘，使其大傾斜後，將之擊沉。另一架則命中敵驅逐艦一艘，起火燃燒後，將其擊毀。</p>
<p>日空軍對敵各機塲</p>
<p>作新春第二次攻擊</p>
<p>（二）日空軍自二日下午十時過後至三日上午零時許，對塞班島阿斯利特機塲，敢行新春第二次攻擊，將之炸毀焚燒。（三）日空軍自一日下午十時許，急襲羣電塞南機塲，焚燒一處，二日上午零時許，再　桑霍塞機塲，當有五處起火，其中一處幷發生大爆炸。又日空軍二日上午一時半至三時許，攻擊塔克羅　敵機塲，焚毀七處，內一處發生大爆炸。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫四日中央社電　日空軍曾於三日黎明對自蘇魯海航行中之敵運輸船團施以猛烈轟炸及掃射，敵已受重創。</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　由日空軍之不斷轟炸，致使塞班島方面敵B29型轟炸機隊受損甚重。茲據美聯社大宮島訊稱：美第二十一軍司令官漢塞爾三日發表，業將其司令部自塞班島移至大宮島。</p>

<p>東京四日中央社電　日小磯首相於四日之閣會議席上，曾發表重要宣言，重申雷伊泰決戰已轉移爲呂宋決戰之意義，期望後方奮起，與政府行政運營之決戰化，並力言本年爲決戰勝利之年，並要求全閣僚之協力，內容如次：本年內必須完成決戰之勝利，但戰局情勢極爲深刻，前於台灣，菲律賓海面，雖已獲到曠古未有之勝利，但我海軍之損害，亦決非小，其後我海陸軍共同以特攻隊之活躍，截殺敵軍之進出，而雷伊泰之戰况，並非絕對有利，今雷伊泰之決戰，已有轉變爲全菲律賓決戰之趨勢，尤其以歐洲戰况觀之，敵方或有擬將歐洲之不利，企求由太平洋戰綫補救之傾向。此時我後方國民必須奮起，增加戰力，以副前綫之健鬥，即政府方面，亦必求强力政治之具體實現及行政運營之決戰化等，以一大決意向前邁進，深望爲完善處理此事態，於輔佐上予以協力。</p>
<h3 id="c3">名古屋等地　火災及撲滅 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　敵機於三日空襲日本本土時，曾於大阪投下若干燒夷彈，然因民間防空陣之活躍，幾未被害。又敵機於濱松地方亦投下燒夷彈，市街地帶並有數處發生火災，然不久即均熄滅。名古屋方面，敵機曾前後七八次以多數機編隊分別來襲，於市街地區混合投下燒夷彈及炸彈，亦曾發生火災，蒙受若干損害，　然以上三都市之重要設施及工廠，幾全未被害。敵機之戰法，以燒夷彈盲炸市街地區，顯係企圖使日本民心發生動搖。</p>
<h3 id="c4">大隊敵艦載機　襲台灣沖繩　立遭邀擊墜毀廿五架 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日大本營四日下午四時發表：（一）自一月三日上午七時四十分許至下午二時三十分之間，曾有以艦載機爲主之敵機累計約五百架，數次以主力來襲台灣冲繩地方，（二）迄現在判明之戰果如次：擊落敵機十七架，予以損害者八架，日方損害輕微。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　敵美有力之機動部隊，三日最接近台灣及冲繩近海，自上午七時四十分起，至下午三時半，以五百架飛機空襲台灣及冲　，日制空部隊立即邀擊，刻下所判明戰果，共擊落其十七架，擊毀八架，計共二十五架。此次敵軍以艦載機爲主，幷自大陸基地派B29型約四十架參戰，以其主力來襲台灣全島各地，冲繩地方約日方毫無損害，台灣損害亦極輕微。前第五十八機動部隊慘遭潰滅打擊後，此次復以機動部隊强行來襲，其目的不外牽制菲律賓戰事，幷切斷日方空軍與菲律賓之補給，菲律賓戰爭，因日本陸海軍一致必死奮鬥，敵軍之短期決戰希望已完全消滅，漸趨於複雜巨大之長期消耗戰形勢。在西歐德軍倫台特攻勢展開新動向之時，强行連續突進作戰，企圖迅速解決菲律賓戰事之焦　，愈加濃化。此次敵機動部隊出動，亦敵方短期決戰思想之表現，敵機動部隊三日來襲後，依然遊弋於台灣近海，更與空襲台灣同時，以伴隨運輸船團之敵機動部隊侵入蘇魯海，有企圖新登陸模樣，總之，菲律賓戰事，正向極微妙之方向發展。</p>

<p>馬尼刺三日中央社電　菲律賓共和國大總統洛勒爾，三日七時三十分，舉行新春交換廣播，其要旨如次：一九四五年之新春，已將解放之光寄與大東亞十億民族，菲律賓民族追憶昔日，對此種意義不勝感謝之至。一九四二年元旦之次日，日軍入馬尼刺城，於是菲律賓過去四百年之苦鬥告一段落，菲律賓多年以來，即努力圖謀自由與獨立之實現，其間友邦日本爲促其實現，曾予以深切之協力。今日新生菲律賓共和國，已與友邦日本國民與大東亞諸國國家民族有同一決心，菲律賓人民因已獲得解放光榮，菲律賓國民決盡最大協力，以達成大東亞共同宣言之目的。茲當此新年，吾人應以今日刻苦奮鬥，誓以不動信念，努力邁進。余遙祝日本國民更能增强新勇氣與新決意，同時，並確信未來勝利定能實現。</p>

<p>（續昨）各處現象都很顯明，敵人欲在西綫準備一個極大的攻勢，進入德國，做一個決定勝負的戰爭，甚至與俄軍在同時夾擊，尤其是在維森堡敵軍前綫各橋頭堡，薩爾及亞琛等處，更足見到敵人攻擊的重心，各處均有甚多生力軍與大量彈藥準備，爲達到他們任務之用。在上述情形之下，德軍遂在蒙沙得里爾區採取攻勢其所負任務有三，然皆互相關聯：（一）擊潰該區之美第一軍，其目的業於十二月二十六日達到。（二）解除西綫各處德軍之困難，並牽制其預備軍。（三）繼續消耗敵人人力與物力，德軍以龐大兵力，並用戰車师進攻，攻勢正面，寬過二百里，以閃電進攻的姿態，對美軍陣綫予以重大的打擊，而後迅速的向西深入，其他德軍，同時前進，補入衝擊部隊，擊潰敵人的抵抗，並保護德軍兩翼，經六天的戰鬥，俘虜的總數達到二萬六千人。按在戰鬥中，死亡與受傷者往往過於俘虜的數倍，由此可知敵人損失的巨大。</p>
<p>自美國第一軍擊潰之後，敵人的抵抗力突然鬆弛，十二月二十六日，遂有美國第一軍被擊潰的情報。德軍在西綫的攻勢，實出敵人意料之外，故敵人在事前毫無準備，敵人所有預備部隊前部置在別處，以爲將來　進攻德軍之用，因德軍此次突然的進攻，而使敵人的目的軍事計劃大受影響。因德軍之準備　　　局勢爲之弛緩，敵人之攻勢大部份立即停止，在德軍繼續攻擊中，克復了許多地方，尤其是薩爾區，敵人之橋頭堡，本是預備決戰攻勢之用的，至是不得不因之放棄，其中遺棄之寶貴器材，殊不易於彌補，因敵人對德軍之攻勢需要援軍，而又不能應手，乃不得不採取臨時措置，由後方勤務（兵戰部隊）兵隊，開到前方抵擋，可是多已在德軍攻破陣綫之後了，而敵人原在其他地方之真正預備隊，此時分用急速行軍鐵道運輸，與機械化方法運輸徵調應用。此祭敵人之軍需運輸交通，當然極其紊亂，因所有運輸兵士與彈藥之工具，在其準備攻擊地點，均須應用，此時德國空軍又對敵人此種臨時措置，加以攻擊，予以妨碍，故德軍之攻勢，不問其向西方再前進若干，以及佔領若干地方，在今日說，已經是達到目的了。</p>
<p>新式武器</p>
<p>威力極大</p>
<p>爲爭取時間而戰鬥，德國最高指揮官已經獲到新的勝利，敵人欲調新的軍隊，新的兵器，新的器材與彈藥，以補充此次德軍攻勢所遭之損失，其所需時日必久。在此時期中，德國之軍需工業，當然能利用光陰，就是軍隊的訓練以及防禦陣地的建築，也當然能利用時間盡力進行，對於德軍在西綫之攻勢，以及所有之新兵器，因軍事關係，未能得到詳細報告，尤其具有極大威力的新兵器的構造等，如V新兵器之類，惟現所可知者，如V二號係十密達長之火箭，形似炸彈，直徑一密達重量十五噸，　轉推進，每小時速度爲五千密達，（快於聲浪速度），高速度爲二百餘里（在真空飛行），着物爆炸，具有最新炸彈，爆炸力非常之大。又由最近英國北部目標亦被射　之一端觀之，即可明瞭其射程之遠，射擊準確，可直接用之於前綫部隊，德軍爲打擊敵人之戰車隊起見，裝備一種新砲極有效力，即對於敵人在歐洲戰塲所使用最新式最重戰車，亦能消滅之。故在德軍開始攻勢十二天之內，曾消滅敵人戰車八百七十輛，德國空軍曾經沉寂多時，敵人方面，亦以爲已經控制了西歐天空，而十二月二十四日的軍事報道，擊墜敵機一百十七架，在二十五日不良天氣中，擊墜八十三架，二十七日爲六十二架。</p>
<p>糧食燃料</p>
<p>均甚充足</p>
<p>至於德國之糧食及製作燃料情形，均爲敵人宣傳所謂不足者，關於德國糧食問題，新由德國來華之哈敏治上尉，曾向吾人詳細說明，即最近所接來自德國之報道，亦已聲明，在戰鬥第六個年中所需之糧食，尤其是脂肪與油類，均充分無虞。此外由於糧政方面之完善組織，絕不容黑市發生或提高物價，故每一德國人仍如開戰以前，以公平代價而能得到個人所需，數日前之聖誕節，每人且能獲到牛油·麵粉·及酒類之特別配給，關於化學汽油之製作問題，旣經大加改良，且範圍特別放大，因防空關係，所有工廠分佈全國，一部份且在地下，至今供應無缺，究竟產量如何，可由此次西綫德軍反攻中所用廣大之戰車隊及機械化部隊而可測知，以其所用汽油，數量至大，援助攻勢空車所用之汽油，且不在內，德國因戰爭關係，在此一方面的自給政策，亦大有進展，總之，西綫戰事，德國指揮部確處主動地位。</p>
<p>東綫南綫</p>
<p>戰事情形</p>
<p>敵人在裝大利，用多數的兵力　　，僅獲得極小土地的進展，實無足以特別注意之處，在巴爾幹戰塲僅有局部地區之戰爭，其中與蒂多氏之游擊隊戰，頗爲嚴重，尤其在門的尼哥之白爾格拉正在行動中，在東戰塲有兩處堅苦的戰鬥如下：</p>
<p>（一）布達斯佩區段俄軍在若干星期以來，一再的進攻，所得僅極小地段，現又在多勞之西向北進攻包圍布達佩斯，同時在該城之西，亦取攻勢，德軍部隊在多勞　處之北及斯洛伐克南方邊境等處，抗戰之經過均甚順利，任何地點的俄軍，都不能獲得較大土地，且隨時遭遇重大損失，尤其戰車的損失特別多。</p>
<p>（二）敵在吉爾南的攻勢，其目的在消滅該處始終堅守之衛軍，而向東海前進，至今德國方面無甚損失，且有時爲德軍反攻所擊退，在此處敵人之戰車　，與飛機亦有顯著的損失，此實　德軍使用新兵器之效果。</p>
<p>總而言之，今日歐洲戰局，敵人無論在任何地方，均未能達到作決定性戰爭之目的，德軍戰　甚爲穩定，抵抗力且日漸增加，敵人原定今冬結束戰事之計劃，完全粉碎，最近德軍攻勢已表現德國指揮部仍擁有甚大而且有戰鬥力之預備隊，不僅可以抵抗强大新式裝備的敵人，並可繼續作有效的攻勢，　德國在精神上的力量人的力量兵器的優秀，以及物質的戰鬥力，決不爲之挫折，在這個地方又可以證明。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c17">學費徵收問題 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>光陰荏苒，本學期又將終了，下學期轉瞬即屆。在這樣的高物價情形之下，下學期學校收費數目，勢將增加。可是，怎樣增加，比較合理，一方面顧到學生家長的負擔，一方面顧到學校的實際開支，確是值得重視的問題。我們相信若干學校的當局，真正能以服務教育爲目的，一定很憂慮學費增加數字太大，必然使學生家長無法負擔，而今學生中途輟學。所以，正在猶豫考慮之中。同時，也有若干學校的當局，對於辦學視同經商，現在物價旣然增漲，學費當然比例增加，似乎振振有詞，持之有理，至於家長不能負擔，將使學生輟學等等問題，漢然視之。</p>
<p>去年底本市教育局戴局長談話，對於下學期欲收學費標準一節，除市校原有規定外，私校方面，根據規模較大歷史較久的私立中小學三百餘校之實際調查，求得半學期各校徵收學費之平均數字，均予以適當之增加，擬訂爲下學期之徵收標準，業於半月　呈請府部核示，不久指令到局，即行公布，令飭各校切實遵照辦理。</p>
<p>從戴局長的談話中，我們知道私立學校下學期收費標準，已由教育局擬訂，呈請核示，尚未決定公布。可是，我們接到讀者報告，目前已有若干學校事實上已經規定收費數目，通知學生家長，並催繳留額金。大約初中爲二萬元，小學一萬五千元（包括籌籍費預收二千元）。那末，這些學校規定的標準，不知是根據什麽的，同時，未在教局規定標準公布以前，是否可以單獨規定徵收，不無問題。而且還有學校，公然向每一學生徵收校投補助費數十元，形同苛雜。</p>
<p>教育事業的目的與意義，社會人士早已瞭解，無庸　論。學費決非物價可比，決不能與物價競賽。我們認爲教局規定的標準，也不能過分遷就事實，僅憑學校單方面的需要，而忽略了發展整個教育的意義。何况尚未經教育當局公布徵收標準之前，若干私立學校　　規定　大數目呢？這是應該糾正的。</p>
<p>其次，我們主張無論物價怎樣高漲，終究是不合理的，學費標準自不能依此決定，而應規定極低數目，假定大學不超過一萬元，高中不超過七千五百元，初中不超過五千元。公立學校有經費彌補，私立學校則就實際開支，除學費以外不足之數，完全由政府撥助，絕對不准浮收學雜費用。至於教職員待遇，同時規定標準一致提高，只須生活必需品由政府特別配給，待遇問題已解決大半。過去，很多學校增加學費所入，並未提高教職員待遇，僅入校長私囊而已。我們希望教育當局特別重視。</p>
<p>現在本市周市長即將接事，周氏過去在江蘇省教育廳長任內頗著聲譽，教育行政，經騐宏富，我們深信今後對於本市教育事業，必能特別重視，因學費龐大而促成普遍失學的嚴重問題，尤盼嚴切注意，則教育前途，實深幸甚。</p>

<p>松平：要之，長期戰對於敵人是不利的，從其國內情勢等看來，企圖短期決戰的色彩很濃，所以凡我國民，更須一新決心，以資對付。</p>
<p>再看對方最高指導方針，則大體有兩種相異而矛盾的思想。其一是儘速解決戰爭，羅斯福等在政治上就是領導國民向這方向走的。另一種是軍人的見解，他們要拖延戰爭，增加軍需生產，使這戰爭的結果有利於美國。這種精神在各方面都流露出來，軍需生產問題即其一端。此外，召開種種國際會議討論航空問題，金融問題，可說也是同樣的事情。敵方的這種舉動，換一個方向看，也是他們的弱點。日本不可有如此的弱點，在眞正統一的思想下遂行戰爭，最爲必要。在此意味下，日本是以皇室爲中心，爲了維護國體而從事自存自衛的戰爭的。換言之，具有不愧天地的戰爭目的。在此種明白的目標下，當然可以統一思想而臨決戰階段。這點不是很幸運的嗎？</p>
<p>松島：常敵人感到焦急的時候，此方正找到了戰勝的端緒。正和宮本武藏相信在對手喘息時就可打倒他一樣，今後不問敵機如何濫炸，我們均應鞏固信念，蓄積戰力。這是必要的。</p>
<p>大陸新報社：</p>
<p>今天報載邱吉爾在議會中演說稱，英國如果處在日本的地位，英國早已崩潰了，所以日本眞是一個奇妙的國家。這種話語多半含有謀略作用吧。</p>
<p>松平：不管是邱吉爾或羅期福，他們送到議會去的諮文或公開發表的談話，都有日本非注意不可的謀略。他們似乎在欺騙自己的國民以外，還企圖欺騙日本國民。末次大將曾經設過，羅斯福如對國民說歐洲等方面的狀况好轉時，日本便不成問題，則美國陸海軍將領便悄悄說解決不了哪。和剛才所說一樣，需要相當長久的時日。這不是想使日本不努力準備決戰嗎？因此、敵方所說的必須愼重加以考慮。</p>
<p>思想戰的嚴密防備</p>
<p>出淵：例如由塞班·迭尼安等接近日本的基地所轉播出來的電訊，都是含有陰謀作用的。所以我們非有堅定的信念不可。</p>
<p>松平：謀略是他們高明呀，關於騙人的事情。</p>
<p>松島：他們常常巧妙反用名人的話語，例如這是首相說的，這是某某名人說的，由此贊現他們惑亂人心的陰謀。</p>
<p>出淵：尤其像上海這種地力，謀略甚多，須要充分注意。</p>
<p>松平：一方面，敵方也看到由於戰局及國內情勢的緣故，國民的動搖甚難補救，所以用盡心計，設法使國民不聽日本的廣播。</p>
<p>出淵：他們用電波來搗亂。</p>
<p>松平：他們的處境險惡時，謀略宣傳也更加强化，這從迄今爲止的例而看，也可知道</p>
<p>松島：最近特別値得注意的是美國報紙宣稱視戰局的推移如何，不妨行使毒氣。此外還有所謂細菌戰，在戰綫的一部分似已實施了。這點倒是不得不注意的。</p>
<p>出淵：渝美空軍在這次大陸作戰中頗有散佈虎疫菌的嫌疑。</p>
<p>松平：可是，他們做出這種事來適足證明其軟弱。</p>
<p>松島：前幾日在某處碰到賀川豐彥氏，曾談到塞班鳥的白骨問題以及其戰綫美軍的殘虐性。賀川氏在十一月八日曾從東京對美廣播，他說美人沒有人格，和南洋吃人的生番一樣。絕對不是基督徒。美人旣和食人種一樣野蠻，則其使用毒氣和細菌，　然須加省悟。總而言之，如何渡過這一年，是當面的目標。而在當地，第一就是鞏固思想的根據，其次就是增產，大家尤須一致團結起來。</p>

<h3 id="e2">Important Declaration by Japanese Prime Minister at Cabinet Meeting, Hoping for National Uprising to Increase War Power <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso made an important declaration at the Cabinet meeting on the 4th, reiterating the significance of the Battle of Leyte shifting to the Battle of Luzon, hoping for an uprising in the rear areas, the government's administrative operations to be geared for decisive battle, and strongly stating that this year is the year for decisive victory. He also requested the cooperation of all cabinet members. The content is as follows: We must complete the victory in the decisive battle this year, but the war situation is extremely serious. Although we have achieved unprecedented victories in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines, the damage to our navy is also not small. Subsequently, our army and navy jointly used special attack forces to intercept and kill enemy troops. The battle situation in Leyte is not absolutely favorable. Now the decisive battle in Leyte has shifted to a decisive battle in the entire Philippines. Especially in view of the European war situation, the enemy may intend to compensate for their disadvantages in Europe through the Pacific theater. At this time, the people in our rear areas must rise up and increase our war power to assist the fierce fighting on the front lines. The government must also seek the concrete realization of strong politics and the gearing of administrative operations for decisive battle, etc., and move forward with great determination, hoping for cooperation in assisting the perfect handling of this situation.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Fires and Extinguishment in Nagoya and Other Places <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – When enemy aircraft attacked the Japanese mainland on the 3rd, they dropped several incendiary bombs over Osaka, but due to the active civil air defense system, there was little damage. Enemy aircraft also dropped incendiary bombs in the Hamamatsu area, and several fires broke out in the urban areas, but they were quickly extinguished. In the Nagoya area, enemy aircraft attacked repeatedly seven or eight times in multiple formations, dropping incendiary bombs and bombs mixed together in urban areas. Some fires occurred, causing some damage, but the important facilities and factories in the above three cities were almost completely undamaged. The enemy's tactics of blindly bombing urban areas with incendiary bombs clearly aims to shake Japanese morale.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 4th: (1) From approximately 7:40 AM to 2:30 PM on January 3rd, approximately 500 enemy aircraft, mainly carrier-based, repeatedly attacked the Taiwan and Okinawa areas. (2) The results confirmed so far are as follows: 17 enemy aircraft shot down, 8 damaged. Japanese losses were minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's powerful U.S. mobile force approached the coastal waters of Taiwan and Okinawa on the 3rd. From 7:40 AM to 3:30 PM, 500 aircraft attacked Taiwan and Okinawa. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted them. The battle results confirmed so far are that 17 aircraft were shot down, and 8 were destroyed, for a total of 25. This time, the enemy army mainly used carrier-based aircraft, and about 40 B-29s were dispatched from mainland bases to participate in the battle, attacking various parts of the entire island of Taiwan with their main force. There was almost no damage to Okinawa. The damage to Taiwan was also very minor. After the Fifth Eighth Mobile Force suffered a disastrous defeat, this time it forcibly attacked again with a mobile force. Its purpose is nothing more than to contain the Philippine campaign and cut off the Japanese air force's supply to the Philippines. The Philippine war is gradually trending towards a complex and huge long-term war of attrition because the Japanese army and navy are fighting to the death. At a time when the German army's counteroffensive in the Ardennes in Western Europe is unfolding in a new direction, the enemy is forcibly launching continuous attacks, and the anxiety to quickly resolve the Philippine campaign is intensifying. The enemy's mobile force was dispatched this time, also a manifestation of the enemy's idea of a short-term decisive battle. After the enemy's mobile force attacked on the 3rd, it continued to cruise in the waters near Taiwan, and at the same time as the air raid on Taiwan, an enemy mobile force accompanying a transport convoy invaded the Sulu Sea, appearing to be attempting a new landing. In short, the Philippine campaign is developing in an extremely subtle direction.</p>

<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) – President Laurel of the Republic of the Philippines held a New Year's exchange broadcast at 7:30 AM on the 3rd, the main points of which were as follows: The New Year of 1945 has entrusted the light of liberation to the one billion people of Greater East Asia. The Filipino people recall the past and express their utmost gratitude for this significance. The day after New Year's Day in 1942, the Japanese army entered the city of Manila, and the four hundred years of bitter struggle in the Philippines came to an end. The Philippines has been working hard for many years to achieve freedom and independence, and the friendly country Japan has provided deep cooperation to promote its realization. Today, the newborn Republic of the Philippines has the same determination as the people of the friendly country Japan and the countries and nations of Greater East Asia. Because the Filipino people have obtained the glory of liberation, the Filipino people will do their best to achieve the goals of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. As this New Year arrives, we should fight hard today and strive forward with unwavering faith. I remotely wish the Japanese people even more enhanced new courage and new determination. At the same time, I am confident that future victories will be realized.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – The German Supreme Headquarters issued a West Front report at noon on the 3rd: The fighting in the vast area of ​​Bastogne is still fierce. The two armies are now engaged in a major battle with advances and retreats. The American army used approximately four divisions each of tanks and infantry to crush the German front west of Bastogne and attempted to encircle the German positions east and southeast of the city from three sides, but lost more than one hundred tanks and only gained a few areas. According to recent reports, the American army has lost 400 artillery pieces, 2,230 tanks and armored vehicles, and 24,000 prisoners in this winter battle. American casualties are about to exceed 50,000. The fighting on the Saar front and eastern Lorraine is still proceeding smoothly. The Saar bridgehead northwest of Forbach has been further expanded. The German army is clearing anti-Axis forces in the northeastern border area of ​​Saargemünd and launching attacks in the lower reaches of the Vosges River, all of which are proceeding smoothly at the same time.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – A report from the Hungarian capital says that the Soviet army concentrated artillery fire and indiscriminately bombed the central area of ​​Budapest. The fortress area and magnificent buildings suffered heavy losses due to the continuous Soviet artillery fire. The Coronation Church was almost completely destroyed, and the side room of the famous parliament building along the Danube collapsed. A major fire broke out on Rákóczi Street, and several small churches were completely razed to the ground. On Tuesday, German and Hungarian forces resisted all Soviet offensives. The focus of the Soviet offensive was on the northeastern suburbs of the capital, where the German army launched a counteroffensive, repelling the Soviet army. Many Red Army soldiers were captured in that area. On the western front of Budapest, house-to-house battles took place all day long. In the past three days, 97 Soviet tanks and 21 artillery pieces were destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e16">German Embassy Military Attaché Speaks on Recent Combat Situation: Unwavering Belief in Victory <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Enemy Offensives</p>
<p>Mostly Halted</p>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) It is abundantly clear in all sectors that the enemy intends to prepare a massive offensive on the Western Front to enter Germany and wage a decisive war. This may even involve a simultaneous pincer attack with Russian forces. The enemy's focus on bridgeheads in front of Visemburg, the Saar, and Aachen further underscores this objective. In these areas, considerable fresh troops and large quantities of ammunition are being prepared for use in their mission. Given this situation, German forces launched an offensive in the Monschau-Echternach area with three interrelated objectives: (1) to defeat the U.S. First Army in the area, which was achieved on December 26th; (2) to alleviate the difficulties faced by German forces on the Western Front and to tie down their reserves; and (3) to continue depleting enemy manpower and resources. German forces, employing substantial troop strength and armored divisions, launched an offensive across a front exceeding two hundred *li*, delivering a significant blow to American lines with a blitzkrieg-style attack. Subsequently, they rapidly advanced westward, with other German forces advancing simultaneously to reinforce the attacking units, suppress enemy resistance, and protect the German flanks. After six days of combat, the total number of prisoners reached 26,000. It is worth noting that casualties and injuries often exceed the number of prisoners by several times, highlighting the immense losses suffered by the enemy.</p>
<p>Following the defeat of the U.S. First Army, enemy resistance suddenly weakened. On December 26th, news of the U.S. First Army's rout became known. The German offensive on the Western Front came as a complete surprise to the enemy, who were utterly unprepared. All enemy reserve units were positioned elsewhere, intended for a future offensive against German forces. This sudden German attack significantly disrupted the enemy's objectives and military plans. The German preparations eased the overall situation, and the majority of the enemy's offensives were immediately halted. During the continued German attacks, many areas were recaptured, especially the enemy's bridgeheads in the Saar region. These bridgeheads, originally intended for a decisive offensive, had to be abandoned, resulting in the loss of valuable equipment that will be difficult to replace. Because the enemy required reinforcements to counter the German offensive, and these were not readily available, they were forced to resort to temporary measures, deploying rear echelon (military service units) troops to the front lines. However, these were mostly deployed after German forces had already breached the lines. The enemy's actual reserves, originally stationed elsewhere, were then mobilized and transported rapidly using rail and mechanized transport. Consequently, the enemy's logistical transport became extremely chaotic, as all the tools for transporting troops and ammunition were required at their planned attack locations. At the same time, the German Air Force attacked and disrupted these temporary measures. Therefore, regardless of how far the German offensive progresses westward or how many areas are occupied, it has already achieved its objectives as of today.</p>
<p>New Weaponry</p>
<p>Extremely Powerful</p>
<p>By fighting to gain time, the German High Command has secured new victories. The enemy will require a long time to deploy new troops, new weapons, and new materials and ammunition to replenish the losses incurred during this German offensive. During this period, German war industries can certainly take advantage of the time. Likewise, military training and the construction of defensive fortifications can proceed with full effort. Due to military considerations, detailed reports on the German offensive on the Western Front and all its new weaponry have not been available, especially regarding the structure of extremely powerful new weapons, such as the V-weapons. However, what is currently known is that the V-2 is a ten-meter-long rocket, shaped like a bomb, with a diameter of one meter and a weight of fifteen tons. It is propelled by a rotating system, reaching a speed of 5,000 meters per hour (faster than the speed of sound), and an altitude of over 200 *li* (flying in a vacuum). Upon impact, it detonates, using a state-of-the-art explosive with immense destructive power. Furthermore, considering that a recent target in northern England was also hit, its long range is evident. Its accuracy allows it to be used directly against front-line units. To combat enemy tank units, German forces have equipped themselves with a new, highly effective artillery piece, capable of destroying even the newest and heaviest tanks used by the enemy on the European battlefield. Consequently, within the first twelve days of the German offensive, 870 enemy tanks were destroyed. After a period of relative inactivity, the German Air Force, which the enemy believed had gained control of Western European airspace, reported shooting down 117 enemy aircraft on December 24th, 83 aircraft on December 25th in adverse weather conditions, and 62 aircraft on December 27th.</p>
<p>Food and Fuel</p>
<p>Are Ample</p>
<p>Regarding Germany's food and fuel production, which enemy propaganda claims to be insufficient, Captain Harminch of the German Army, newly arrived in China from Germany, has provided our people with detailed explanations. Recent reports from Germany also confirm that the food required for the sixth year of the war, particularly fats and oils, is ample and not a cause for concern. Furthermore, thanks to the sound organization of food administration, the black market is prevented from developing, and prices are not allowed to rise. Therefore, every German citizen can still obtain their personal needs at a fair price, as they did before the war. During the recent Christmas holiday, each person even received special rations of butter, flour, and alcohol. The production of synthetic gasoline has been greatly improved and expanded. For air defense purposes, all factories are distributed across the country, some even underground, and supply remains uninterrupted to this day. The exact level of production can be estimated by the extensive use of armored and mechanized units in the current German counter-offensive on the Western Front, given the enormous quantities of gasoline used, not including the gasoline used by aircraft supporting the offensive. Due to the war, Germany's policy of self-sufficiency in this area has made significant progress. In short, the German command is definitely in a proactive position on the Western Front.</p>
<p>Eastern and Southern Fronts</p>
<p>Combat Situation</p>
<p>In Italy, the enemy is using a large number of troops, and has only made very small territorial gains, and is not worthy of special attention. There is only local warfare in the Balkan theatre, and the war with Tito's guerrillas is serious, especially in Montenegro, where Belgrade is currently active. On the Eastern Front there are two hard fought battles:</p>
<p>(1) In the Budapest sector, the Russian army has attacked repeatedly for several weeks, gaining only a small area. It is now attacking Buda west to north to encircle Budapest, while also taking an offensive on the west side of the city. The German army fought successfully in the north of Dorau and the southern border of Slovakia. The Russian army at any point can not get greater land, and always suffer heavy losses, especially the loss of tanks.</p>
<p>(2) The enemy's offensive in Gilan aims to destroy the guards who have been holding out there and advance to the East China Sea. So far, the German side has not suffered much loss, and has been repulsed by German counter-attacks from time to time. The enemy also suffered significant losses of tanks and aircraft at this place. This is the result of the use of new German weapons.</p>
<p>In summary, in today's European war situation, the enemy has failed to achieve the purpose of a decisive war anywhere. The German war situation is very stable, and the resistance is increasing day by day. The enemy's original plan to end the war this winter has been completely shattered. The recent German offensive has shown that the German command still has a very large and combative reserve team, which can not only resist the enemy with powerful new equipment, but also continue to make an effective offensive. Germany's spiritual strength, human power, the excellence of weapons, and the material combat power will never be frustrated. This is another thing that can be proven. (The end)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Tuition Fee Collection Issues <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Time flies, and the current semester is coming to an end, with the next semester fast approaching. Amidst these high prices, school fees for the next semester are sure to increase. However, how to increase them in a reasonable manner, considering both the burden on students' families and the actual expenses of the schools, is indeed a matter worthy of attention. We believe that the authorities of some schools, who truly aim to serve education, are undoubtedly worried that a large increase in tuition fees will make it impossible for students' families to afford them, leading to students dropping out midway. Therefore, they are hesitating and considering. At the same time, there are also authorities of some schools who treat running schools as doing business. Now that prices have increased, tuition fees should naturally increase proportionally, which seems reasonable enough. As for the problems of parents not being able to afford it, leading to students dropping out, they disregard them.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Director Dai of the Municipal Education Bureau spoke about the tuition fee standards for the next semester. In addition to the existing regulations for municipal schools, for private schools, based on an actual survey of over 300 private primary and secondary schools with larger scales and longer histories, the average amount of tuition fees collected by each school per semester was obtained, and appropriate increases were made. A proposed collection standard for the next semester was then formulated and submitted to the government for review and approval half a month ago. Upon receiving instructions from the Bureau, it will be announced, instructing all schools to strictly comply.</p>
<p>From Director Dai's remarks, we know that the tuition fee standards for private schools for the next semester have been drafted by the Education Bureau, submitted for review, and have not yet been decided or announced. However, we have received reports from readers that some schools have already effectively set tuition fees, notified students' families, and urged them to pay reservation fees. These are approximately 20,000 *yuan* for junior high school and 15,000 *yuan* for elementary school (including a 2,000 *yuan* prepaid fundraising fee). Then, the standards set by these schools are not known to be based on what, and at the same time, it is questionable whether they can set and collect fees independently before the standards set by the Education Bureau are announced. Moreover, some schools are openly charging each student dozens of *yuan* for school investment subsidies, which is akin to arbitrary levies.</p>
<p>The purpose and significance of education are already understood by society, and there is no need to discuss them. Tuition fees are by no means comparable to prices and should not compete with them. We believe that the standards set by the Education Bureau should also not unduly accommodate the facts, relying solely on the needs of the schools and neglecting the significance of developing the entire education system. Moreover, before the collection standards are announced by the education authorities, some private schools have already set large numbers of fees? This should be corrected.</p>
<p>Secondly, we argue that no matter how high prices rise, they are ultimately unreasonable, and tuition fee standards should not be determined based on this. Instead, extremely low numbers should be set, assuming that universities do not exceed 10,000 *yuan*, senior high schools do not exceed 7,500 *yuan*, and junior high schools do not exceed 5,000 *yuan*. Public schools have funding to make up the difference, while private schools, based on actual expenses, can have the deficit beyond tuition fees fully subsidized by the government. Absolutely no additional miscellaneous fees should be allowed. As for the salaries of teachers and staff, standards should be set at the same time and raised uniformly, and if only essential necessities are specially allocated by the government, most of the salary problems will have been solved. In the past, many schools did not raise the salaries of teachers and staff with the increased tuition fees, but only pocketed them for the principals. We hope that the education authorities pay special attention to this.</p>
<p>Now, Mayor Zhou of this city is about to take office. Zhou has a good reputation from his time as Director of the Education Department of Jiangsu Province, and he has extensive experience in educational administration. We firmly believe that in the future, he will pay special attention to the educational affairs of this city. We especially hope that he will pay close attention to the serious problem of widespread school dropout caused by high tuition fees, and that the future of education will be very fortunate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce has received a letter from the various trade associations of the city's tea and food industry, requesting the organization of the Shanghai Flour and Noodles Products Industry Joint Association, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Industry for review and approval. The association has recently received approval No. 2067 from the Ministry of Industry, which states: "The establishment of industry joint associations is suspended by the joint organization of local industry associations. The request of the Shanghai Tea and Food Industry Association to organize the Flour and Noodle Industry Joint Association is limited to Shanghai only, and does not meet the regulations of the joint association, so it is difficult to approve. However, if the association, etc., is for the purpose of seeking public welfare, and there is indeed a need for organization, it can first form an industry fellowship association, and should first submit the articles of association, etc., for review and approval."</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the year, the purchase of goods in various industries has gradually become calm. The prices of various goods have not changed significantly, which is due to the sharp increase in the amount of material supply and the sluggish sales channels, resulting in a balance of supply and demand and stable public sentiment. However, some materials, such as soy sauce, vegetables, Shaoxing wine, salt, and cotton textiles, are still moving towards a high peak, and the trend of rising prices is quite intense. The illegal price increases have aroused the close attention of the authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e30">"Merchant Beggars" Respond to "Literary Beggars" <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Commission-Based Scholarship</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Guangzheng initiated the "Begging for Righteousness" fundraising team for the newspaper's scholarship fund, and in his capacity as a "literary beggar", donated 20,000 *yuan* to China Film Company as the first team of "Begging for Righteousness". Then, Mr. Qian Gongxia, editor of Yulin, donated 2,000 *yuan* in response. I am a small clerk who can barely take care of himself, and I am usually ashamed of myself for not having the spirit of Wu Xun to "cultivate for others". Now that the end of the year is approaching, I have received a commission of 20,000 *yuan*. After reading the articles by Yang and Qian, and thinking about the difficulty of my own children's education, I decided to donate 2,000 *yuan* of "one thousand out of ten thousand" to your newspaper, in the capacity of a "merchant beggar" to respond to Mr. Yang, who calls himself a "literary beggar". Although my life is difficult, this time, for example, a small amount of commission has been allocated to Cheng Ling to show a little effort, in order to promote the idea of commission-based scholarships. "Who is not as good as me in loving goodness"? There are countless large and small companies and shops in this city. During this time between the old and new years, there are countless people who have received ten or a hundred times more bonuses than I have, from managers to all levels of employees. There are also many kind-hearted people among them. If everyone can follow this method of "commission-based scholarship", no matter if it is 10%, 5%, or even a few percent or a few thousandths, I think that hundreds of thousands of "Begging for Righteousness" teams can be easily formed. Not only will the 5,000 poor students of this newspaper be solved, but even ten times this number of out-of-school youths can be easily solved. For this reason, I respectfully ask the readers to do their part, each contributing a bit of strength, accumulating virtue and blessings, in order to complete this scholarship mission of "a hundred-year tree planting"! (Small Clerk's Manuscript Fee for Scholarship)</p>
<p>(Note) This person, who calls himself a "small clerk," is unknown to us. From what he has written, his words are filled with fervent emotion. No one can deny that he is an up-and-coming talent with ideas and vision in the business world. That is why I have published it as soon as possible, in order to attract the attention of employees in the commercial and industrial sectors, and to encourage them to unanimously agree and donate generously. It is better to act than to sit and talk!</p>
<p>Lisheng Bank Enthusiastically Supports Scholarships</p>
<p>"Your newspaper is organizing the 8th fundraising team for the scholarship fund, with each team pledging to donate at least 20,000 *yuan*. This is a righteous cause for scholarships, and I express my utmost support. In addition to raising 30,000 *yuan*, I personally pledge to donate 10,000 *yuan*, to do my small part. Herewith, I send a transfer order for a total of 40,000 *yuan*. Lisheng Bank pledges to donate 20,000 *yuan*, named Lisheng Bank Team One. I pledge to donate 10,000 *yuan*, and Zhou Jiaju and Li Dehua each pledge to donate 5,000 *yuan*, named Lisheng Bank Team Two. Please process accordingly and issue official receipts."</p>
<p>Chen Li, wife of the late Xiancai (a flower basket presented by colleagues of Zhenzhong Industrial Company, converted to a donation) 10,000 *yuan*, Li Da Xiang (sent by Liu Zhi on behalf of Chen Weiquan) 10,000 *yuan*, Meng Hanjiang 2,000 *yuan*, Chenxin Button Factory 1,000 *yuan*, Wang Xinjiang, Liu Ji, Rong Ji, 500 *yuan* each, Ye Qiming 100 *yuan*. A total of 24,600 *yuan* in stored coupons was received, with a balance of 7,357,378 *yuan*.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Prospects for the Current Stage of the War (5): Roundtable Discussion by the Heads of the Shanghai Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Information Departments <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Matsudaira: In short, a prolonged war is unfavorable for the enemy. Judging from their domestic situation and other factors, they have a strong inclination to seek a short, decisive battle. Therefore, all our citizens must renew their determination to deal with this.</p>
<p>Looking at the other side's highest guiding principles, there are generally two differing and contradictory ideas. One is to resolve the war as quickly as possible; Roosevelt and others are politically leading the nation in this direction. The other is the military's view, which is to prolong the war, increase military production, and make the outcome of the war favorable to the United States. This spirit is revealed in all aspects, with the military production issue being one example. In addition, holding various international conferences to discuss aviation issues and financial issues can be said to be the same thing. Viewing the enemy's actions from another perspective, it is also their weakness. Japan must not have such weaknesses. It is most necessary to wage war under a truly unified ideology. In this sense, Japan is centered on the Imperial Family, engaging in a war of self-preservation and self-defense to safeguard the national essence. In other words, it has a war objective worthy of heaven and earth. Under this clear objective, it is naturally possible to unify thinking and face the decisive battle stage. Isn't this very fortunate?</p>
<p>Matsushima: Often when the enemy feels anxious, we are finding the beginnings of victory. Just as Miyamoto Musashi believed that he could defeat his opponent when he gasped for breath, we should all strengthen our beliefs and accumulate our war power in the future, no matter how the enemy planes indiscriminately bomb us. This is necessary.</p>
<p>Continental New Daily News:</p>
<p>Today's newspaper reported that Churchill said in Parliament that if Britain were in Japan's position, Britain would have collapsed long ago, so Japan is truly a miraculous country. Such words mostly contain strategic purposes, right?</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Whether it is Churchill or Roosevelt, their messages to Parliament or publicly released statements contain strategies that Japan must pay attention to. They seem to be deceiving not only their own people but also attempting to deceive the Japanese people. General Suetsugu once postulated that if Roosevelt told the public that the situation in Europe and other areas was improving and that Japan would not be a problem, then the US Army and Navy generals would quietly say that it could not be resolved. As mentioned earlier, it will take a considerable amount of time. Isn't this trying to keep Japan from making efforts to prepare for the decisive battle? Therefore, what the enemy says must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Tight Security Against Ideological Warfare</p>
<p>Idechi: For example, the telecommunications relayed from bases near Japan, such as Saipan and Tinian, all contain conspiratorial purposes. Therefore, we must have a firm belief.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: Their strategies are brilliant when it comes to deception.</p>
<p>Matsushima: They often cleverly reverse the words of famous people, for example, "This is what the Prime Minister said," or "This is what so-and-so celebrity said," thereby revealing their plot to confuse people's hearts.</p>
<p>Idechi: Especially in a place like Shanghai, there are many strategies, so we must pay close attention.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: On the one hand, the enemy also sees that due to the war situation and domestic conditions, the people's wavering is difficult to remedy, so they try their best to prevent the people from listening to Japanese broadcasts.</p>
<p>Idechi: They use radio waves to interfere.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: When their situation is perilous, their propaganda is further strengthened, as can be seen from past examples.</p>
<p>Matsushima: What is particularly noteworthy recently is that American newspapers are claiming that depending on how the war progresses, they may use poison gas. In addition, there is the so-called germ warfare, which seems to have been implemented in some parts of the front lines. This is something we must pay attention to.</p>
<p>Idechi: The Chongqing-US Air Force is suspected of spreading tularemia bacteria during this continental operation.</p>
<p>Matsudaira: However, their doing such a thing only proves their weakness.</p>
<p>Matsushima: A few days ago, I met Mr. Toyohiko Kagawa somewhere and talked about the white bones of Saipan and the brutality of the American soldiers on the front lines. Mr. Kagawa broadcast to the United States from Tokyo on November 8, saying that Americans have no personality and are like man-eating savages in the South Seas. They are definitely not Christians. Since Americans are as barbaric as cannibals, their use of poison gas and bacteria must be understood. In short, how to get through this year is the immediate goal. And in the local area, the first is to consolidate the ideological foundation, and the second is to increase production, and everyone must unite together.</p>
