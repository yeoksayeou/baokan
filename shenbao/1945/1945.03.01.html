<p>東京二十八日中央社電　硫黃鳥之敵軍，二十六日晨以來，在海軍艦砲轟擊掩護下，展開全面大攻勢，是日上午九時，敵巡洋艦，驅逐艦約二十艘，運輸船約百艘，其他舟艇統計一百二三十隻，在該島東南約五公里之海面，向日軍陣地猛加砲擊，同時該島敵空軍卡其新型水上偵察機及互型飛機總計約四十架，亦出動協力作戰。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　硫黃島之戰况，自敵軍於二十六日晨展開大攻勢後，似已進入決戰階段，該島南部正面之日軍守備隊，至二十六日夜止，仍在與侵入屏風山元砲台，海軍砲台地帶之敵軍展開熾烈爭奪戰，結果，日軍現仍保持二十五日下午之戰綫。西部正面之日軍守備部隊，對於由天狗岩（在千鳥飛行塲東北側）進犯田原坂附近之敵軍，加以猛烈反擊，結果將其擊退，日軍之陣地現仍在阿蘇合高地一帶。二十六日通夜，敵軍射來大批燒夷彈及黃燐彈，同時，幷以海上艦砲射擊，以阻日軍補修陣地及推進突擊。二十七日晟六時許，敵在千鳥飛行塲南端之重砲陣地再度展開砲擊，日軍則英勇反攻，死守陣地。二十六日晟敵軍開始大攻勢，然其損害亦隨之增大，迄二十六日正午，敵軍損失已達一萬八千五百名，迄二十七日夕，敵軍戰車被擱三十八輛，兵員被殺傷二千餘名，總計自登陸以來迄二十七日夕，敵軍之損害達二萬另入百名之多。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　硫黃島日軍發揮全力應戰，敵方損害隨之增加，二十三日夜，厚地大佐指揮之日軍部隊，自摺鉢山突破重圍，而與東部主陣地之日軍會兵一處，該部隊僅在摺鉢山一處，已殺傷敵兵約一千名。</p>

<p>呂宋前線二十八日中央社電馬尼刺之日陸海軍，逐漸縮短戰線，舊城內四境之日軍，突破敵軍包圍，與城內小數友軍會合。二十四·五兩日，數度擊退敵軍攻勢，敵軍終採取焦土戰術，於城壁之橋眼內，利用火燄放飛器，幷自丟燒夷彈，城內火光衝天。二十五日夜，敵軍戰車突入城壁一角，與日軍展開凄慘血戰，至二十六日晨，因市街之大部份及城壁之一部份通信連路斷絕，日軍戰况不明。科列基多島之激戰依然繼續，全島籠單於砲彈之烟幕下。克拉克地區，日陸海軍遭敵軍猛攻，一半陣地失陷，現仍據守殘餘陣地，進行防禦戰，連夜乘機突擊，予敵損害甚大。二十五日邀擊突入陣地之敵方戰車，擱坐其一輛，餘均擊退，敵軍已使用克拉克機塲，似有轟炸機由雷伊泰方面進駐該地之模樣。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫二十八日中央社電　馬尼刺市內之戰鬥，現在繼續激戰中者，爲馬尼刺飯店，即舊城附近地方，敵對城內日軍曾以擴音機勸告歸降，日軍即以槍彈擊中擴音機，使其沉默，故日軍士氣仍極旺盛。現包圍日軍之敵兵力，爲騎兵第一師，步兵第三師，空挺第十一師之各一部，加以戰車及裝甲車，合計約二百輛，各種火砲約百五十門。又白湖南岸之白羅斯巴紐斯方面，敵於二十三日晚曾以舟艇約百艘，渡白湖實行登陸，現日軍正與之激戰中。</p>

<p>緬甸前綫基地二十八日中央社電　北緬戰綫方面之英重與重慶間，巳早呈對立現象，最近因待遇懸殊及被輕視關係，致對立情形已更愈趨深刻。據於凱維尼河南方莫羅附近投歸日軍之重慶兵士宣稱，重慶軍第五十師約一運半兵士二百，一月十五日曾於卡門摩南方頓加附近，對附近之英人部隊約一百名加以念襲，交戰及三日之久，英軍損害戰死者爲八十五名，重慶軍方面亦戰死五十名，該次衛突即爲重慶軍幹部對英軍憤慨巳達極點之表現。因重慶軍幹部之待遇尚不及英軍一兵士，同時彼等於英軍眼中倍遭輕視，故有此次行動，因之北緬戰綫方面之紛爭已日趨激化。</p>

<h3 id="c9">敏捷與遲鈍 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>「敏捷」的反面是「邇鈍」。無論在思想，說話，做事，都能表現出「敏捷」，或是「遲鈍」的現象。</p>
<p>如以做事爲例：怎樣是敏捷呢？敏捷就是機警與迅速。在同樣時間內，比較做得多，做得好，做得快。同時，做得少，做得壞，做得慢的，就是遲鈍。因此，工作敏捷的，其效率就比較高，工作遲鈍的，其效率就比較低。這更是極顯著的判別</p>
<p>「潦草」的反面是「精細」，也是相對的在比較上可以表現的。不過，「敏捷」絕不是「潦草」，而「遲鈍」更與「精細」不同。如果做得「潦草」而稱之爲「敏捷」，做得「遲鈍」而托之美名曰「精細」，那末，只能自欺，而決不可能欺人的。反之，眞正做到「敏捷」的，內容一定包括「精細」，而工作「遲鈍」的其內容又不免潦草。所以，在工作的總效率上觀察，敏捷決不是潦草，而遲鈍決不能算作精細。</p>
<p>我們中國人，有一種最足表現遲鈍的習慣，譬如舉行集會，不論是娑會，或是會議，大都數人總是不守時間，總是遲到。有的人還以爲遲到是身份地位高貴的表示。又如辦公時間，大多數人也不慣遵守，遲到早退，習爲常事。因爲集會不遵守時間，躭誤了一部分準時與會者的寳貴時問。因爲辦公不遵守時問，貽誤了很多緊要的公務，減低整個工作的效率。再如訂立契的，在履行規定條件時，總是漫不注意，馬馬虎虎，對於的定的時間或是金錢，總是拖延緩慢，因而極易引起糾紛，無非收於遲鈍的結果。</p>
<p>在日本國內，對於遵守時間一點，可以說已經普遍注意，從遵守時間的精神上，建立了做事敏捷的習慣的因此，無論政府機關民間團體，上行下效。於是工作有敏捷精神，發生最高效率。這與我們恰巧相反，從而也可覜察敏捷與遲鈍的區別，工作效率的區別。因此，從敏捷與遲鈍的現象，可以表現國家民挨的精神。處事敏捷足以表示民族的進步，處事遲鈍，足以表示民族的老大。</p>
<p>目前是大東亞戰爭決戰時期，在比賽總力以決定勝負的時期。我們是參戰國家，是參與比賽總力中的一員，無論在思想上行動上，都需要出以敏捷，爭取時間，爭取效率，加强總力，貢獻於戰爭。同時，對於一切遲　的舊習慣，自應以自覺的精神，各自變革。而政府高級官吏以及社會領袖，尤貴以身作則，倡導於上，蔚成風氣。</p>

<h3 id="c20">出淵報道部長　談渝共糾紛　美與延安聯合壓迫重慶 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>盟邦日本陸軍報道部於昨（一）日下午三時假漢彌登大樓接見本市中國新聞記者，到有出淵陸軍報道部長，前原中尉，江城囑托暨各報社記者等，出淵部長即席就渝共最近糾紛情形，發表談話，茲錄於後：</p>
<p>渝共交涉由美促成</p>
<p>延安代表周恩來，於去年十二月間抵渝，談判渝共問題，歷時兩月，因雙方意見相距甚遠，無法獲得解決，其交涉決裂原因，於渝王世杰在二月十四日發表交涉理由及周恩來二月十五日（離渝前）在重慶發表聲明中，可見一斑。</p>
<p>此次談判與去年雙方經五個月長期折衝會談者相同，惟此次會談，由美國從中慫通，乃此次會談特異之點，惟美代表雖有極大發言權，終亦無法解決，足證兩黨之根本對立</p>
<p>此次會談中心，乃渝共互相爭取領導權，重慶主張延安黨權軍權均應誓以服從重慶爲主體，方許延安政權存在，延安方面則反對重慶之獨裁，主張成立民主主義聯立政府。</p>
<p>兩黨爭權無法解決</p>
<p>延安之目的，表面上以打倒日本統一抗戰工作陣線爲號召，形式上乃設立所謂民主政府，至於兩段革命者，即實現民主主義革命，純屬兩黨革命領導權之爭執，本質上與去年之交涉情形毫無二致，則雙方所持指導理論根本無法解決，故兩黨絕無合作可能。</p>
<p>假如雙方不改變飛指導理論，欲求和解，則非重慶讓步不可，美灤知調解前途棘手，偏仍繼續進行，甚至命令駐渝大使哈萊，居中斡旋。</p>
<p>美之干涉兩黨內幕，早爲一般所明悉，但以戰局之緊急進展，美遂加緊對渝增施壓力，致中國將成爲決戰塲所，故美對中國之關心亦與日俱增，渝共之能否澈底合作，共同應付日本，實乃美之重要關鍵，爲此不得不迫使重慶與共黨妥協，而美之與延安接近，乃因美擬在西北建立空軍基地，使延安能直接獲到美之物資援助，故渝共之妥協必須依賴美之强大發言權，然雙方能否合作，亦以美之意見爲依歸。如此觀察渝共問題，或可無訛。重慶雖堅持主張，欲獲得美之援助，然不得不依從美國，由此可知美聯合延安壓迫重慶之一斑矣。</p>
<p>共黨對渝攻擊益烈</p>
<p>共黨對渝政治攻勢，近亦日趨緊迫，據二月十七日解放日報以克里米亞三國會議爲題，批評重慶請：延安主張取消重慶之獨裁，因三國共同宣言主張樹立聯合政府而愈趨强化，使重慶獨裁頓受打擊，最近美報復公開暴露中國內幕，開始攻擊重慶，據二月二十二日紐的合衆社電，渝新聞檢查處因檢查外報特派員之寫作，引起各外報之賣難，日見不鮮。</p>
<p>總之，美與延安聯合壓迫重慶使渝共問題將發生下列兩疑問，一美將如何單獨實現侵略野心？二重慶之獨裁因美之壓迫將趨如何程度？但重慶因深受壓迫，中國前途，必有重大問題產生，即重慶將成延安化，中國人民將成爲美之奴隸。</p>

<p>本市工商聯誼會，於昨日下午四時舉行第六屆會員大會，出席雙方會員吳　齊·顧南羣·王伯元·羅訥齋·項康原·王懷廉·陳紹媽·栗本寅治。友永騰三郎·村川善美·立川團三等數十人。日方來賓新本顧問，大使館福間副領事，及市府許局長徐局長袁局長周局長等。由理事長聞蘭亭主席，行禮如儀，首由主席致開會詞及會務戰告，繼由船津辰一郎及林康侯陳彬龢相織致詞，對於中日雙方工商界應謀進一步合作，增進生產，協力戰爭，加倍努力等頗多闡述，旋進茶點散會。</p>
<p>聞蘭亭詞</p>
<p>今天本會舉行第六屆會員大會，承蒙中日長官光臨指敎，很爲欣幸，特先代表同人敬致謝意。本會係應中日雙方工商界的需要而設立，設立以來，備蒙各方贊助，並賴雙方會員之熱忱協力，得有今日之規模，殊堪慶幸。今後決本旣定方針，向前邁進，完成本會創立意旨，聯絡雙方工商界友誼，進而加强事業上之互利合作，爲本會主要任務，其他有關社會福利事業，本會亦努力提倡或參加，不過同人等各爲本身職務所羈，時感心餘力細，仍懇雙方長官以及各界賢哲，時予指導，以便遵循。上海始終是趣濟的重心，中日兩國能在經濟關係上做到密切無間，不僅貢獻戰爭，抑且有益民生，中日民間能先樹立經濟關係密切的規模，自能加强富方的合作，因此，從這點立論，本會的使命特加艱巨，而需要我們會員的努力，也特別的殷切。最近本會徵得新會員兩位，一爲尹祚乾先生，一爲岡武雄先生。又本會第三屆理事植塲鐵三先生因事辭職，經第七次理事會公推伴野淸先生繼任，以上兩位新會員及新理事伴野先生，都係本市工商界素負聲望的人士，今後得與我們共同協力會務，本會會務定有加速的進展，這是可喜可賀的事。</p>
<p>船津致詞</p>
<p>本會係上海工商界有力者所組成，自成立以來，對于經濟方面，不僅俱加硏究與討論，且均有重要之貢獻，尤共對中日工商界之合作，倍形加强，深以爲慰。然從主觀及客觀方面來着，單以中日雙方工商界人士來參加本會，似尙嫌不够，今後宜加倍努力，擴展其組織。蓋以大東亞戰爭，興亡在此關頭，務望我們在此戰爭中合力求生，而達到勝利，要達到戰爭中勝利，還是要中日雙方合作，加倍努力才是。</p>

<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The enemy forces on Iwo Jima, under the cover of naval bombardment since the morning of the 26th, have launched an all-out offensive. At approximately 9:00 AM on the same day, about 20 enemy cruisers and destroyers, approximately 100 transport ships, and an estimated 120-130 other vessels fiercely bombarded Japanese positions from the sea approximately five kilometers southeast of the island. Simultaneously, approximately 40 enemy aircraft, including "Jake" (Type 2 Seaplane) new-type seaplane reconnaissance planes and "Helldiver" aircraft, also mobilized to assist in the operation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The battle situation on Iwo Jima, since the enemy launched a major offensive on the morning of the 26th, appears to have entered a decisive phase. The Japanese garrison on the southern front was still engaged in fierce fighting with enemy forces that had infiltrated the Motoyama Airfield and naval artillery battery area as of the night of the 26th. As a result, Japanese forces still maintain the battle lines of the afternoon of the 25th. The Japanese garrison on the western front launched a fierce counterattack against enemy forces advancing on the vicinity of Tawarazaka (northeast of Chidori Airfield) from Tenguiwa, resulting in their repulsion. Japanese positions are currently still in the area of Mount Asō. Throughout the night of the 26th, enemy forces fired large numbers of incendiary and white phosphorus bombs, while also firing from naval vessels to prevent Japanese forces from repairing their positions and launching counterattacks. At approximately 6:00 AM on the 27th, the enemy once again launched artillery fire from heavy artillery positions at the southern end of Chidori Airfield. Japanese forces heroically counterattacked and defended their positions. Although the enemy began a major offensive on the morning of the 26th, their losses have also increased accordingly. By noon on the 26th, enemy losses had reached 18,500 men. By the evening of the 27th, 38 enemy tanks had been disabled and over 2,000 enemy soldiers had been killed or wounded. In total, since the landing until the evening of the 27th, enemy casualties have reached over 20,900 men.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese forces on Iwo Jima are fighting with all their might, and enemy casualties are increasing accordingly. On the night of the 23rd, a Japanese unit commanded by Colonel Atsuji broke through the encirclement from Mount Suribachi and joined forces with the main Japanese force on the eastern front. This unit alone inflicted approximately 1,000 enemy casualties in the Mount Suribachi area.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Forces in Manila Gradually Shortening Battle Lines <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Luzon Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese army and navy in Manila are gradually shortening their battle lines. Japanese forces within the four borders of the old city broke through the enemy encirclement and joined forces with a small number of friendly troops within the city. On the 24th and 25th, they repelled enemy offensives several times. The enemy finally adopted a scorched-earth tactic, using flamethrowers and dropping incendiary bombs within the breaches of the city walls, causing the city to be engulfed in flames. On the night of the 25th, enemy tanks broke into a corner of the city walls, and a fierce and bloody battle ensued with Japanese forces. By the morning of the 26th, communication lines to most of the city and a portion of the city walls had been severed, and the Japanese battle situation was unclear. Fierce fighting on Corregidor Island continues, with the entire island shrouded in a cloud of artillery fire. In the Clark area, Japanese army and naval forces have been subjected to intense enemy attacks, and half of their positions have been lost. They are currently defending the remaining positions, conducting defensive warfare, and launching night raids, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. On the 25th, they intercepted enemy tanks that had broken into their positions, disabling one and repelling the rest. The enemy has already used Clark Airfield and appears to be deploying bombers from the Leyte area to that location.</p>
<p>Philippines Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The battle within Manila continues to rage, with the Manila Hotel, near the old city, being the site of particularly fierce fighting. The enemy used loudspeakers to urge the Japanese forces within the city to surrender, but the Japanese forces silenced the loudspeakers with gunfire, demonstrating their high morale. The enemy forces currently surrounding the Japanese forces consist of elements of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 3rd Infantry Division, and the 11th Airborne Division, along with approximately 200 tanks and armored vehicles and approximately 150 artillery pieces of various types. Also, on the south bank of Laguna de Bay, in the Los Baños area, the enemy landed on the night of the 23rd using approximately 100 boats, and Japanese forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting with them.</p>

<p>Burma Front, 28th (Dispatch) – The Indian 5th Division, having crossed the Irrawaddy River southwest of Pakokku, attempted to attack the Myingyan area, but was met with a severe counterattack by Japanese forces, resulting in its near-collapse. There have been no other changes on the Burmese front.</p>
<p>Burma Front Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The antagonism between British forces and the Chongqing (Nationalist Chinese) forces on the northern Burmese front has long been present, and recently, due to disparities in treatment and a sense of being looked down upon, the conflict has become even more pronounced. According to Chongqing soldiers who defected to the Japanese army near Molo, south of the Kaukkwe River, approximately 200 soldiers, or about one and a half battalions, of the Chongqing 50th Division ambushed approximately 100 British troops near Tongka, south of Kamaing, on January 15th. The fighting lasted for three days, resulting in 85 British deaths. The Chongqing forces also suffered 50 deaths. This ambush was an expression of the extreme resentment of the Chongqing officers towards the British army. Because the treatment of Chongqing officers was even less than that of a British soldier, and at the same time, they were despised by the British army, this action was taken. As a result, the conflicts on the northern Burmese front are intensifying daily.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Agility and Sluggishness <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The opposite of "agility" is "sluggishness." Whether in thought, speech, or action, one can exhibit the phenomena of "agility" or "sluggishness."</p>
<p>Taking action as an example: What is agility? Agility is alertness and speed. In the same amount of time, doing more, doing better, and doing faster is agility. At the same time, doing less, doing worse, and doing slower is sluggishness. Therefore, those who work agilely have higher efficiency, while those who work sluggishly have lower efficiency. This is a very obvious distinction.</p>
<p>The opposite of "sloppiness" is "meticulousness," which is also relative and can be expressed in comparison. However, "agility" is definitely not "sloppiness," and "sluggishness" is even more different from "meticulousness." If doing something "sloppily" is called "agility," and doing something "sluggishly" is beautified as "meticulousness," then one can only deceive oneself and never deceive others. On the contrary, true "agility" certainly includes "meticulousness," while the content of "sluggish" work is inevitably sloppy. Therefore, observing the overall efficiency of work, agility is definitely not sloppiness, and sluggishness cannot be considered meticulousness.</p>
<p>We Chinese have a habit that best exemplifies sluggishness. For example, when holding gatherings, whether social or meetings, most people do not respect time and are always late. Some people even think that being late is a sign of high status. Also, in terms of office hours, most people are not accustomed to observing them, arriving late and leaving early as a common practice. Because gatherings do not respect time, they delay the valuable time of those who attend on time. Because offices do not respect time, they delay many important official duties and reduce the efficiency of the overall work. Another example is when making contracts, people are always inattentive to fulfilling the stipulated conditions, doing things carelessly. They are always slow in delaying the agreed time or money, which easily causes disputes, and is nothing but the result of sluggishness.</p>
<p>Within Japan, it can be said that universal attention has been paid to respecting time, and the habit of acting agilely has been established from the spirit of respecting time. Therefore, both government agencies and private organizations follow suit. As a result, work has an agile spirit, resulting in the highest efficiency. This is the opposite of us, from which we can also observe the difference between agility and sluggishness, and the difference in work efficiency. Therefore, from the phenomena of agility and sluggishness, one can express the spirit of a nation. Acting agilely is sufficient to represent the progress of a nation, while acting sluggishly is sufficient to represent the nation's old age.</p>
<p>Currently, it is the decisive phase of the Greater East Asia War, a time to compete in overall strength to determine victory or defeat. We are a participating country, a member of the overall strength competition. Whether in thought or action, we need to act agilely, seize time, seize efficiency, strengthen overall strength, and contribute to the war. At the same time, we should transform all sluggish old habits with a conscious spirit. Government senior officials and social leaders should especially lead by example, advocating from above and creating a prevailing atmosphere.</p>

In addition, there is also the claim of establishing a "Production Army." In response, the government believes that it is necessary to make this decision and announce it, and the plan was submitted to the Cabinet meeting on the 27th for deliberation and passed.

(2) Regarding private enterprises, a thorough implementation will be carried out in accordance with the spirit of the Military Supply Company Law.

<p>Stockholm, 28th - Central News Agency telegram: Reuter reports from London: Churchill announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the San Francisco Conference will gather representatives of the anti-Axis powers who declared war on Germany and Japan before March 1, 1945, to sign the declaration of the anti-Axis powers conference. When Churchill mentioned "several countries are now declaring war," there was uproarious laughter.</p>
<p>The Boundaries of New Poland</p>
<p>In his speech, Churchill revealed the boundaries of the new Poland as agreed upon at the Yalta Conference. It is said that Poland can obtain land concessions in the north and west. In the north, it can obtain Danzig, land west and south of Königsberg, and a wide coastline along the Baltic Sea, to replace the pre-war corridor. In the west, it can obtain the important industrial area of Upper Silesia and some areas east of the Oder River, the extent of which will be decided at the peace conference. Churchill also stated that the British government will continue to recognize the Polish government in London until the new provisional Polish government established according to the Yalta Conference is announced.</p>
<p>Respecting the Independence of Lebanon and Syria</p>
<p>Churchill also stated: The British government's position on Syria and Lebanon is based on the decision made in 1941, in which both Britain and France affirmed the independence of these two Eastern countries. Britain is now determined to respect the independence of these two countries. However, given the cultural and historical ties established between France and Syria, we want to do our utmost to preserve its special status. We believe that these two countries can be firmly established with the support of world organizations, while France's privileges will also be recognized.</p>

<p>The Propaganda Department of the Allied Japanese Army met with Chinese news reporters from this city at the Hamilton Building at 3:00 PM yesterday (1st). Those present included Ide, Chief of the Army Propaganda Department, Lieutenant Maehara, Jiangcheng Trustee, and reporters from various newspapers. Chief Ide delivered a speech on the recent disputes between Chongqing and Yan'an, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Chongqing-Yan'an Negotiations Facilitated by the United States</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai, the representative of Yan'an, arrived in Chongqing in December of last year to negotiate the Chongqing-Yan'an issue. After two months, due to the vast differences between the two sides' opinions, no resolution could be reached. The reasons for the breakdown of the negotiations can be seen in the reasons for the negotiations published by Wang Shijie of Chongqing on February 14 and Zhou Enlai's statement in Chongqing on February 15 (before leaving Chongqing).</p>
<p>This negotiation is the same as the long-term consultation and negotiation between the two sides for five months last year. However, this negotiation was instigated by the United States, which is the unique point of this negotiation. However, even though the US representative has great influence, they ultimately failed to resolve the issue, which proves the fundamental opposition between the two parties.</p>
<p>The focus of this negotiation is the Chongqing and Yan'an's struggle for leadership. Chongqing argues that Yan'an's party and military power should pledge allegiance to Chongqing as the main body, only then will Yan'an's regime be allowed to exist. Yan'an opposes Chongqing's dictatorship and advocates the establishment of a democratic joint government.</p>
<p>The Struggle for Power Between the Two Parties Cannot Be Resolved</p>
<p>Yan'an's goal, on the surface, is to use the slogan of overthrowing Japan and unifying the anti-Japanese war work front. In form, it is to establish a so-called democratic government. As for the two-stage revolution, that is, to realize the democratic revolution, it is purely a struggle for the revolutionary leadership of the two parties. In essence, it is no different from last year's negotiations. The guiding theories held by both parties cannot be fundamentally resolved, so there is absolutely no possibility of cooperation between the two parties.</p>
<p>If the two sides do not change their guiding theories and want to reconcile, Chongqing must make concessions. The United States knows that the prospect of mediation is difficult, but it still continues, even ordering Ambassador Hurley to Chongqing to mediate.</p>
<p>The US interference in the internal affairs of the two parties has long been known to the general public. However, with the urgent progress of the war situation, the United States has intensified its pressure on Chongqing, causing China to become a decisive battlefield. Therefore, the United States' concern for China is also increasing day by day. Whether Chongqing and the Communist Party can thoroughly cooperate and jointly deal with Japan is a crucial point for the United States. For this reason, it has to force Chongqing to compromise with the Communist Party. The United States' approach to Yan'an is because the United States intends to establish an air base in the Northwest, so that Yan'an can directly obtain US material assistance. Therefore, the compromise between Chongqing and the Communist Party must rely on the United States' strong influence. Whether the two sides can cooperate also depends on the United States' opinion. Observing the Chongqing-Yan'an issue in this way may not be wrong. Although Chongqing insists on its position and wants to obtain US assistance, it has to follow the United States. From this, we can see a glimpse of the United States' joint pressure on Yan'an to oppress Chongqing.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's Attacks on Chongqing are Becoming More Intense</p>
<p>The Communist Party's political offensive against Chongqing has also become increasingly urgent recently. According to the "Liberation Daily" on February 17, with the theme of the Crimea Three-Power Conference, criticizing Chongqing, it is requested that Yan'an advocate the abolition of Chongqing's dictatorship. The joint declaration of the three countries advocates the establishment of a coalition government, which has become increasingly strengthened, and Chongqing's dictatorship has suffered a blow. Recently, the US news has openly exposed the inside story of China and began to attack Chongqing. According to a February 22 report by the United Press, the Chongqing News Inspection Office has caused frequent complaints from foreign newspaper special correspondents due to the inspection of their writing.</p>
<p>In short, the United States and Yan'an jointly pressuring Chongqing will raise the following two questions about the Chongqing-Yan'an issue: First, how will the United States realize its aggressive ambitions alone? Second, to what extent will Chongqing's dictatorship be pressured by the United States? However, because Chongqing is deeply oppressed, there will inevitably be major problems in China's future, that is, Chongqing will become Yan'anized, and the Chinese people will become slaves of the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Industry and Commerce Association Holds General Membership Meeting Yesterday - Chinese and Japanese Members Attended <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The City Industry and Commerce Association held its sixth general membership meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Dozens of members from both sides attended, including Wu Qi, Gu Nanqun, Wang Boyuan, Luo Nezhai, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Huailian, Chen Shao Ma, Kurimoto Toraji, Tomonaga Tosaburo, Murakawa Yoshimi, and Tatekawa Danzo. Japanese guests included Consultant Niimoto, Vice Consul Fukuma from the Embassy, and Bureau Chiefs Xu, Yuan, and Zhou from the City Government. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Wen Lanting, with the usual formalities. First, the chairman gave an opening speech and a report on association affairs, followed by speeches by Funatsu Tatsuiichiro and Lin Kanghou Chen Binhe, who elaborated on how the Chinese and Japanese business communities should seek further cooperation, increase production, and jointly strive for the war effort, and redouble their efforts. Afterwards, refreshments were served and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Wen Lanting's Speech</p>
<p>Today, our association is holding its sixth general membership meeting. We are very pleased to have Chinese and Japanese officials present to give us guidance, and I would like to express our gratitude on behalf of all the members. Our association was established in response to the needs of the Chinese and Japanese business communities. Since its establishment, it has received support from all parties and relied on the enthusiasm and cooperation of members from both sides, and it has achieved its current scale, which is very gratifying. In the future, we will adhere to our established policies, move forward, and fulfill the original intention of the association, connect the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese business communities, and further strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in business, which is the main task of the association. The association will also strive to promote or participate in other social welfare undertakings. However, the members are all constrained by their own duties, and they often feel that their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient. We still sincerely ask Chinese and Japanese officials and wise men from all walks of life to give us guidance from time to time so that we can follow. Shanghai has always been the economic center. If China and Japan can achieve close economic relations, it will not only contribute to the war effort but also benefit the people's livelihood. If the Chinese and Japanese people can first establish a close economic relationship, they can strengthen the cooperation of the rich. Therefore, from this point of view, the mission of our association is particularly arduous, and the efforts of our members are also particularly urgent. Recently, our association has recruited two new members, Mr. Yin Zuogan and Mr. Oka Takeo. Also, Mr. Ueba Tetsuzo, the director of the third session of our association, has resigned due to personal reasons, and Mr. Tomono Kiyoshi has been publicly elected to succeed him by the seventh board of directors. The above two new members and new director Mr. Tomono are all respected figures in the city's business community. In the future, they will work together with us on association affairs, and the association's affairs will definitely accelerate, which is a gratifying thing.</p>
<p>Funatsu's Speech</p>
<p>This association is composed of powerful people in the Shanghai business community. Since its establishment, it has not only conducted research and discussions on economic aspects, but also made important contributions, especially to the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese business communities, which is deeply gratifying. However, from a subjective and objective point of view, it seems that it is not enough for only Chinese and Japanese business people to participate in this association. In the future, we should redouble our efforts to expand its organization. Because the Great East Asia War is at a critical juncture for survival, we must strive to survive together in this war and achieve victory. To achieve victory in the war, we still need the cooperation and redoubled efforts of China and Japan.</p>

The civil servants who accepted bribes have been transferred to the Nanjing Special Court for trial and sentenced. All the bribing businesses were investigated and clarified by the police bureau one by one, and the Finance Bureau punished them according to the regulations. There were 195 cases where the bribe money was more than 10,000 yuan. They have been fined ten times the amount of tax embezzled and ordered to pay it. Most of the businesses have paid the full amount, and less than one-tenth are in arrears, which are being strictly enforced. There are still more than 670 cases where the bribe money is less than 10,000 yuan, and the punishment procedures are still being carried out.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Basketball Championship Remains Undecided: Chinese Athletic Association Defeats Chung Bei, Each Wins Once, Rematch Scheduled <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The final of the second round of the Class A and A1 group public basketball competition between the two powerhouses, the Chinese Athletic Association and Chung Bei, took place last night amidst an extremely tense atmosphere. The Chinese Athletic Association defeated Chung Bei by a score of 39 to 34, avenging their previous loss and creating an equal standing. At halftime, the score was tied at 17 points each. The championship remains undecided and will be re-contested at a later date. The audience was even larger than the first final. Both sides fielded their most ideal lineups. Chung Bei consisted of Li Chen-chung, Chen Hsueh-tsung, Chao Ya-lin, Cho Kuo-jung, and Bao Song. The Chinese Athletic Association fielded Wu Cheng-chang, Burt, Chang Liang-hsiung, Fan Ching-kung, and Chu Hsi-lin. The first half saw a back-and-forth battle, resulting in a tie of 17 points each. In the second half, the Chinese Athletic Association gradually gained the upper hand and maintained the lead, ultimately winning with a score of 39 to 34. Unfortunately, both sides committed numerous fouls, resulting in seven players being ejected from the two teams, a blemish on the match. For the Chinese Athletic Association, Wu, Chang, Fan, and Chuan Chang-chun were ejected. Substitutes included Kong Kuang-yi, Chen Tso-liang, and Chang Hsien-lun. For Chung Bei, Chao, Bao, and Li Chen-chung were ejected, leaving Chung Bei to finish the game with only four players. Wang Chung-tao and Li Pao-chung were substituted in. Shen Yu-kung was injured after slipping and was helped off the court. It seems that the Chinese Athletic Association has returned to normal last night, while Chung Bei had slightly worse luck.</p>
