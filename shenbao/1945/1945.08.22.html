<h3>緬英軍散傳單　促日軍投降</h3>
<p>仰光二十日電　緬境前錢英軍，曾使用想像所及之各種方法，促敵投降，但毫未收效，迄今並無跡象足以說明敵將來投降，若謂日軍尙不知其舉國巳經投降之事實，實無理由。英空軍昨日以數千萬張傳單投擲於西湯河東岸，傳單由緬境英印軍總司令簽署，英要求日軍遣特使至盟軍陣地，以擬定投降細節。庇古與西湯河間運河上隣近里　蘇之印度旅團，會以土砲向日軍陣地發射傳單，砲中塞以稻草及傳單，置於小船上沿運河猛力推去，並以大量傳單散入敵軍隱蔽陣地及壕內，日軍竟仍不知其本國巳投降之事，殊堪詫異。昨日在納容里賓附近俘獲之日軍六名，竟均不知昭和之投降勅書。其在東瓜附近俘獲之日軍四名，竟亦未聞此事。</p>

<p>抗戰八週年，終於達到了我們預定目的——最後勝利，在此期間，全國的民衆，遭　殘酷的砲火洗禮，忍受了　沛流離的痛苦，終賴我全國軍民一心一德，堅信主義，在最高領袖蔣總裁領導與旣定國策之下，不屈不撓，歷盡艱險而卒底於成。全國民衆鼓舞昇平，重慶來甦，從此可度　安定的生活，而我們一班胼手胝足的工友們，在本黨整個領導組織之下，艱苦關奮，執行神聖使命的工作，當磨折了這整整八足年今撫歷創傷，在此劃歷史時期到臨的今日我們爲了保持我們過去光榮的歷史，和努力於民族經濟復與，以謀我們勞工前途幸福起見，我們是要愈益加强我們組織，鞏固團結，負起我們新德使命，以完成勞工徒事於建國的重任</p>
<p>努力生產　復與經濟</p>
<p>我們經過這次戰爭之後，各地所有的工業建設，差不多巳遭受了很大的破壞，在世界上，我們是巳經奠定了大國的地位，可是在經濟上，因爲是一向追隨於當時列強之後，萌芽尙待培植，所以在僅餘的各種工業統計上講，本市是佔着了相當重要的地位，同樣也有可觀的生產勞工數量，這次偉大戰爭的勝利，固然把以前工業上各種桎梏，盡行袪除，以後，對於工業發展上是可以順利進行無疑的了，可是工廠建設的破壞程度，也着足驚人，所以我們要在經濟上努力發展，以躋於大國之林，那麽，我們潛藏有偉大生產力量的勞工　衆，無異將直接負起這偉大的使命來。現在我們首先應當把完整的原有工業建設，及各公用水電交通事業，盡力的維持，使能繼續安全的使用，從這僅存的工業上，我們努力建設生產，發揚光大起來，以遂滬復與經濟建國的偉大目的。</p>
<p>加强組織　協助復昌</p>
<p>原有的勞工組織，從今日起，我們是應當繼續加以鞏固的，在本黨組織下的工作同志，是當協助對於復員工作的順利進行，我們勞工同志，在民族解放鬥爭成之後，對於工業建設經濟復興，無異將爲我們勞工運動今後的方針之一，所以今後的勞工組織一方面仍　從事於本身生活解放工作之外，還當在民族經濟復與，工業建設的大課題之下，盡更大的努力，務使重大的勞工　衆，本黨整個領導之下，循正確的途經，加速我們勞工新使命的完成。新的歷史的開展，當然是需要我們勞工新的力量來輝煌和充實它的，我們勞工階　在這次民族解放鬥爭上，固巳盡很大努力，可是在新的環境之下，自然需要我們繼續勞力，來增高我們勞工在新中國建設上的地位，以保持我們過去光榮的歷史</p>
<h3>浦東集中營慰勞記</h3>
<p>— 張中楹</p>
<p>四年悠長的時間</p>
<p>本埠英美僑民自太平洋戰事爆發以後，分在浦東·楊樹浦·及滬西等處集中，其間經過四年的悠長時間，以彼等平時在滬生活之舒適，環境之優裕，一旦被遣集中，自不免稍感痛苦。但按諸事實，待遇尙可，且較之一般士兵之戰時生活亦覺無多大差別。</p>
<p>但人類天性，獲有極端自由之時，總不能體念受拘束時之痛苦，反之，一受到拘束，便感覺到自由之可貴，英美僑民在此時期，當部能例外，差幸彼等明瞭目前形勢，更熟悉國際戰爭趨向，故身在營中，心境坦然·隔江觀影，雖有今昔之感，然一至夕陽西下之際，皓月東升之時，閒步營中，屢獎感到生命消長之愉快。</p>
<p>發起勸募慰勞費</p>
<p>今日戰爭結束，和平重建，英美僑民咸靜待釋放，且拘留日久，更有待外間人士之探望。本埠名流何世楨博士有鑒于斯，且早年留學美國，回國後又常與英美人士交遊，情誼甚篤，　欲趨訪，惟隔于環境，未克如願，每當風雨晦明，棷興屋樑落月之感。今茲天朗氣淸，山河將復舊觀，特組織一委員會，榜曰：國際聯誼會，委員十一人，張叔平·王人麟·艾國藩·黃友蓬·章强牲·倪光祖及　者爲委員，當公推何氏爲主席，並聘金城銀行謝咸耀，大亞銀行黃納川及聯華銀行劉哲民爲經濟顧問，自上屋期起開始勸募慰勞費用，一切至前日止均　備就緒，於昨日分派各委員携何氏具名之慰勞書一通，分赴各集中營探望，並面致慰勞，茲將經過情形略述于次，俾本埠中外人士平日　懸于彼處者，聊慰渴想。</p>
<p>分赴各營慰勞情形</p>
<p>昨日分赴各集中營者，本有三起，惟筆者與章强牲君及浙江與業銀行金伯銘三人，代表何氏往浦東營中慰勞。</p>
<p>下午二時，趨車至海關碼頭，當由小舢板渡至彼岸，抵岸時，慰勞者巳紛至沓來，我等三人即步至營中，營房爲三層樓，中有空地甚廣，其中赤膊者有之，拖鞋赤脚者亦有之，融融洩洩頗有田間風尙。至二樓，入辦公室，負責者英人係亞次氏，美人本由培之氏負責，現彼辭職，由勃朗氏接替。當由我等三人面遞何氏慰勞函一件，並致支票五紙，托彼等轉付各僑民收訖，後即分別致勞慰之枕，蒙熟烈接受，旦被引至全營觀覽；僑民見我等至，咸趨前握手，略致寒暄，即至樓下廳堂。至四時見有各團體前往慰勞者，不絕於途，乃興辭吿退。</p>
<p>臨別由亞次及勃朗兩君托向何世楨博十代收敬意，並吿知浦西人士，略謂旬日之間，將重臨西按，向江頭之可望而不可接之巍巍大厦，致三鞠躬景仰，並向海上各界人士再致一呼三握手之景慕焉。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>自由談的性格</h3>
<p>— 成</p>
<p>自由談的性格，在編者例言中已經簡單的說明：「自由自在地談論所想所見所聞，而必須與大衆有益的話。」換言之，談論雖有自由，而必以大衆有益，至少對於讀者發生若干有益的作用爲前提。</p>
<p>因此，對於現實批評的文字，不嫌其深刻犀利，可是，一味恣意漫罵式的；只有消極的攻擊而沒有積極的建議的；都不足取。</p>
<p>其次，只談風花雪月的消閑文字，當然也爲一部分讀者所愛讀，不過在目前緊張的時代，在目前狹小的篇幅中，暫時不易發表。反之，富有幽默　示的短文，庽意深遠的文藝作品，都在歡迎之列。</p>
<p>因爲這幾天拜讀讀者賜稿以後，感覺一部分未能符合我們的目標，爰再申說如上，敬盼同文垂　。</p>
<h3>「自由談」小史</h3>
<p>— 陳偉</p>
<p>該是一個值得興奮的消息——「自由談」復刋了，它在白話文學史中有很悠久的歷史。</p>
<p>曾經一度是禮拜六派的談情說愛的塲地，也有一度是短小精悍「雜文」會師的園地，總之，是一個歷盡滄桑的副刋。</p>
<p>茲以參考所得，略談「自由談」小史：</p>
<p>「自由談」創刋於淸末宣統三年陰曆七月一日，陽歷是公元一九一一年八月二十四日，初由王鈍根主編，內容多茶餘酒後的消遣文字。</p>
<p>民國四年三月，由吳覺迷擔任編務，曾經一度微求軍人詩文，以激發國民尙武　神。</p>
<p>爲時恰一年，換由姚熓　主持，這一片當時唯一的「副刋」，竟成爲「南社」同人發表詩文的園地。此外，另闢了一個「自由談之自由談」小園地。</p>
<p>從民國五年十月底起，由陳栩園（即天虛我生）接編，除小品散文外，還刋載一些受讀者歡迎的「家庭常識」。</p>
<p>民國七年以後天虛我生已是一個實業家，於是由陳冷血編之，着重短小精悍之短論。</p>
<p>民九年四月一日起，由周瘦鵑主持了十二年，刋載的是當時極受歡迎的作品，執筆者全是海上著名文人，在目下看來，殊有鴛鴦蝴蝶派作風無疑。民十年將篇幅分爲「閑話」，「雜錄」，「所聞拾遺」，「遊記」，「劇談」，「餘滴」，「瑣錄」等類，此外尙有連載有年的長篇章冋小說及文藝掌故。</p>
<p>民國二十一年年底，周編本埠增刋，翌年年初，爲迎合某一部讀者愛好，仍由周編「春秋」之另一副刋。而「自由談」一欄，則有一個突變，完全由新文藝提倡者執筆，的確是「自由談」光芒萬丈的時代。編者係剛由法國回來的黎烈文，有新文藝思，經常撰稿者有魯迅，郁達夫，曹聚仁，老舍……。同時因爲注雜文，提拔了不少新作家，如孔另境，錢杏邨，施墊存，庸弢等，但魯迅爲特殊關係，用了不少不同的筆名投稿，再見諸全集二十集中。</p>
<p>言論太激烈了，不得不　出了「只談風花雪月」的啟事，風格漸趨平淡，後即由張梓生接編，至廿四年十月底停刋。其中有幾塲盤腸大筆戰，如學生必讀莊子問題，大衆語問題，幽默問題，都很有名，在各人的散文集裏見得到。</p>
<p>據胡寄　統計，事變前「自由談」首尾共得二十四年又三個月。</p>
<p>民二十七年雙十節「申報」在滬復刋，由王任叔主編「自由談」，仍有「　迅風」。</p>
<p>不久改胡山源編輯，執筆者多靑年文人，如丁諦，文宗山等，筆鋒不及以前老練。</p>
<p>年餘，由黃嘉　編，刋西洋幽默小品，及科學趣味，風格完全像「西風」雜誌。</p>
<p>卅年十二月八日停刋，卅一年又復刋，對上海社會問題很注意，小品則多刋靑年修養方面的文字</p>
<p>卅二年，爲篇幅關係，這園地就搬到復刋後的「申報月刋」去了，報上就只有每星期一次的「白茅」。月刋上的「自由談」，就缺少那以前的蓬勃氣息了。</p>
<p>直到目前，廿日起「自由談」又復刋了，我們願祝它能努力地前進，反映着此後的時代齒輪，我們更願意這歷史悠久的副刋此後永遠地存在。</p>
<h3>破曉</h3>
<p>— 林毅</p>
<p>晨雞啼破了清曉，</p>
<p>萬彙的生物從沉睡中醒來。</p>
<p>一輪朝霞，</p>
<p>衝破了滿天的陰　；</p>
<p>是　舞，是歡忻，是新生，是活力。</p>
<p>看晨光　微中！</p>

<p>Chongqing, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, flew by special plane to the forward headquarters in Zhijiang on the 20th to hold an agreement on the terms of the armistice with representatives of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army Headquarters.

<p>Zhijiang, 21st (dispatch) - The weather was clear and cloudless. The people of Zhijiang City hung flags in the morning to celebrate the arrival of peace, and an atmosphere of tranquility filled the entire city. Airplanes soared in the sky, congratulating each other. Three Mustang aircraft of our mixed squadron, piloted by our air force lieutenants Zhou Tianjin, Lin Zeguang, and Xu Zhiguang, and U.S. Air Force Captains Glenfen and Lowe, took off and headed towards Changde. At that time, more than ten thousand Chinese and American people followed each other, vying to go to the airport to witness the arrival of the Japanese envoys who would surrender on behalf of three million people. At 10:15 AM, our three aircraft discovered the Japanese aircraft southwest of Changde and immediately divided into leading and following positions, heading towards Zhijiang. At the same time, several of our fighter planes were on alert over the Hualong airfield. Later, one of our escort planes landed first, and thunderous cheers erupted at the airport. Soon, the Japanese aircraft landed, and the audience rushed forward, but were unable to approach due to strict security. Finally, our two escort planes landed. At 11:20 AM, the Japanese aircraft proceeded to the designated location, with four-meter-long red banners tightly attached to each end of the wings. At 11:25 AM, under our strict protection, the Japanese aircraft headed to the Army Headquarters. We sent Major Chen to receive them. Major General Takeo Imai stood at attention and asked Major Chen if he could disembark. Chen replied that he could. Imai, formally dressed and wearing his military sword, disembarked first, looking sorrowful and silent. He was allowed to have his luggage inspected by our military police, and the Japanese aircraft engineer saluted Imai and asked for instructions on handling the luggage. At 12:30 PM, Major Chen led Imai and his seven staff members into the city by car. At that time, photographers took pictures one after another, and the situation was very tense. At 2:30 PM, Imai went to pay his respects to Chief of Staff Xiao to discuss preliminary surrender matters. The list of Japanese surrender envoys and their staff is as follows: Staff Officer Yoshio Hashima, Okawo Maekawa, Major Kihachi Matsubara, Zensuke Kubo, Aviation Officer Masari Kohachido, and Employee Masaharu Nakagawa.</p>
<p>At 3:40 PM, Imai went to the Army Headquarters to pay his respects to the Chief of Staff to discuss surrender matters and received the memorandum from Commander-in-Chief He to General Neiji Okamura. When Imai met with Chief of Staff Xiao, it was in a meeting hall that was neatly decorated. A portrait of the Founding Father and the Party and National flags were hung in the front, with the national emblems of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and a giant "V" sign placed above them. More than a hundred military officers participating in the talks included Chief of Staff Xiao, Deputy Chief of Staff Leng Xin, and U.S. military operations commander General Patrick Hurley. When Imai's delegation of four arrived, they looked sorrowful. Imai sat opposite the Chief of Staff. The Chief of Staff asked the Japanese representative ten questions, his attitude solemn. After receiving the memorandum, Imai immediately signed and stamped it, agreeing to relay it immediately.</p>

The Allied forces will be the vanguard (of the landing war). The Japanese special envoy brought back 24 or 25 pages of U.S. military landing instructions and will execute them accordingly without the need for further meetings or notifications.</p>
<p>Manila, 21st (dispatch) - Chinese and foreign reporters visited General Xu Yongchang, head of the Chinese delegation, on the 21st. Xu expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of the reporters.

<p>Tokyo, 20th (Deng Meng Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 21st: "The Allied forces have decided to begin stationing airlifted units at Atsugi on August 26th. On August 28th, naval units will begin stationing at Yokosuka Port. At the same time, the Japanese army and navy (including the air force) will immediately begin transferring defenses from Kanagawa Prefecture and the southern part of the Boso Peninsula. The areas after the Japanese army and navy have transferred defenses will be temporarily maintained by the police and military police. It should be especially stated that the stationing of the United Nations forces in Japan this time is based on full consultation with the United Nations side and is implemented under stable conditions after proper measures by the Japanese Empire. Therefore, it is hoped that the people, especially those in the areas near the United Nations troops, will not cause unnecessary anxiety, and should still maintain order as usual, and work with peace of mind, without any agitation."</p>
<p>Situation of Manila Talks; Representatives of Both Sides' Land and Sea Forces Held Separate Talks; Soviet General Staff Sends Representatives to the Philippines</p>
<p>Manila, 21st (Central News Agency, United Press dispatch) - The Manila Conference has ended. Speakers participating in the conference said: They deeply believe that the Japanese are indeed sincere and honest, and are striving to cooperate with the U.S. side. The two sides did not discuss the international situation, and did not mention the atomic bombs or other matters, except for mentioning the damage suffered by the Japanese mainland from U.S. bombing. According to a joint Manila dispatch from General MacArthur's headquarters to the Japanese General Headquarters, the Japanese surrender delegation left Manila after 1:00 PM (Japan time) on the 20th and returned to their country. Before they left, they had two talks with General MacArthur's Chief of Staff, which lasted for two and a half hours. General MacArthur himself did not attend. The ceremony was grand at the beginning of the meeting, and the meeting was divided into separate talks between representatives of the land, sea, and air forces of both sides.</p>
<p>Manila, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese special envoys were very busy during their 20-hour stay in Manila. They went to Manila on the orders of General MacArthur to provide information to facilitate the entry of the Allied Supreme Commander and his entourage into Tokyo, and to hand over this plan of the Allies to the Japanese government. The Japanese envoys arrived in the Philippines at 6:00 PM on the 19th and immediately entered the bullet-scarred city hall of General MacArthur's headquarters. At 9:00 PM, they held talks with the staff of the Supreme Commander. The talks lasted until 2:00 AM on the 20th. At 9:00 AM, the Japanese envoys rushed to the headquarters to hand over the certificate to General Sutherland, Chief of Staff of the Supreme Commander, and continued the talks of the previous night. Kawabe, the chief Japanese envoy, got off the plane first. He looked depressed and serious for most of the time he met with the Allied personnel, but he showed a slight ease during the discussion. Only when he heard the Allied plan to land on his homeland did he become unhappy again. Kawabe collaborated to provide MacArthur's staff with the information they needed, which was provided by representatives of the heads of the Japanese army, navy, and their air forces. Although Kawabe could speak a little English, he spoke in Japanese when speaking as a representative of the Japanese government, so someone was translating beside him. He gave the impression of a typical Japanese soldier. At the end of the talks, General Sutherland said to Kawabe, the chief Japanese envoy: "I thank you for your cooperation and hope you have a safe return to Tokyo." Kawabe replied: "I am deeply grateful for your concern for us. I express my heartfelt thanks for the scenery."</p>

<h3>Heavy Losses of Japanese Naval Vessels</h3>

At the beginning of the war, Japan had 12 battleships, but now it only has one, which has also been severely damaged. Of the original nine first-line aircraft carriers, only two that have been severely damaged remain. Of the seven light aircraft carriers, only two remain. Of the 165 light and heavy cruisers, only 26 remain. Of the 140 submarines, only 16 remain. In addition, there are six submarines that Germany transferred to Japan before its surrender.</p>
<h3>British Army in Burma Distributes Leaflets Urging Japanese Troops to Surrender</h3>
<p>Yangon, 20th - The British army in Burma has used every imaginable method to urge the enemy to surrender, but to no avail. To date, there is no indication that the enemy will surrender. It is unreasonable to say that the Japanese army is still unaware that their country has already surrendered. Yesterday, the British Air Force dropped tens of millions of leaflets on the east bank of the Xitang River. The leaflets were signed by the Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army in Burma. Britain demanded that the Japanese army send a special envoy to the Allied positions to formulate the details of the surrender. The Indian Brigade near Lisu on the canal between Bigu and Xitang River would fire leaflets at Japanese positions with earthen cannons. The cannons were filled with straw and leaflets, placed on small boats and pushed vigorously along the canal, and a large number of leaflets were scattered into the enemy's concealed positions and trenches. It is surprising that the Japanese army still does not know that their country has surrendered. Six Japanese soldiers captured near Narongri Village yesterday were unaware of the Emperor's surrender edict. Four Japanese soldiers captured near Donggua had not heard of this either.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Strengthen Control Over the Secrets of Atomic Bomb Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Washington, 21st - The U.S. President will send a special message to Congress next month, recommending that the government permanently control all stages of the development of atomic energy. Senator Thomas, Chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, said that the Department of the Army is preparing a measure, which may be proposed by Thomas after Congress receives the President's message. He declined to comment on the details of the bill, but said that no matter what path the law takes, we can be sure that the discovery of the secret of launching atomic energy was successful with the money of the American people, so this secret belongs to all the American people and must be used to promote the happiness of all the American people. Thomas and the Department of the Army's bill will include all wartime and peacetime uses of the destructive power that led to Japan's surrender this time. Senator Mahani, another member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, said that the government must also control the production of all radioactive ores that can split atoms.</p>
<h3>Civil Shipwreck; All Crew Members Were Rescued</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Minsheng Company's civil ship, on the 19th, sailing to Sandouping, shipwrecked due to encountering whirlpools near Liulinji (below Badong). The ship was a charter ship with a load capacity of 300 tons. It was carrying 1,200 government officials and public personnel this time, only about 50 tons, but because the hold was not loaded with goods, it was heavier on top and lighter on the bottom. When it reached Liulinji, it encountered a whirlpool, causing the rudder to fail. The ship gradually sank. Fortunately, the time taken was five hours, and all the personnel on board had been rescued, with only some items lost. The ship is still one-quarter above the water surface and can be salvaged when the water recedes.</p>
<h3>Guidance Committee of the Municipal Party's Labor Movement: A Message to Shanghai Workers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's Guidance Committee for the Workers' Movement, which has led the city's laborers in their struggle against the enemy and puppets for the past eight years, now that victory has arrived, issues the following message to the workers of Shanghai:</p>
<p>Through Hardships and Dangers, Success Achieved</p>
<p>The eight-year War of Resistance has finally reached our predetermined goal – final victory. During this period, the people of the whole country have suffered the baptism of cruel artillery fire and endured the pain of displacement. Ultimately, relying on the unity and devotion of our national military and civilians, firmly believing in our principles, and under the leadership of Supreme Leader President Chiang and the established national policy, we have persevered unyieldingly, experiencing all kinds of hardships and dangers, and finally achieved success. The people of the whole country are encouraged by the restoration of peace, Chongqing has been revived, and from now on, we can live a stable life. We, the hard-working laborers, under the entire leadership and organization of our Party, have worked hard and diligently, performing the sacred mission. Now, after eight full years of hardship, and at this historic moment, in order to preserve our glorious history and strive for national economic recovery, and for the sake of the happiness of our laborers in the future, we must further strengthen our organization, consolidate our unity, and shoulder our new mission, in order to complete the important task of laborers dedicating themselves to national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Strive for Production, Restore the Economy</p>
<p>After this war, almost all industrial construction in various places has suffered great damage. In the world, we have already established ourselves as a major power, but economically, because we have always followed behind the great powers of the time, our budding industries still need to be cultivated. Therefore, in the statistics of the remaining various industries, this city occupies a considerably important position, and also has a considerable number of productive laborers. The victory of this great war has undoubtedly removed all kinds of shackles on industry, and future industrial development can undoubtedly proceed smoothly. However, the extent of damage to factory construction is also alarming. Therefore, if we want to strive for economic development and join the ranks of major powers, then our laborers, who possess great productive power, will undoubtedly directly shoulder this great mission. Now, we must first do our best to maintain the complete original industrial construction and various public utilities such as water, electricity, and transportation, so that they can continue to be used safely. From these remaining industries, we must strive to build and produce, and promote and develop them, so as to achieve the great goal of economic reconstruction of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Strengthen Organizations, Assist in Recovery and Prosperity</p>
<p>From today onwards, we must continue to consolidate the existing labor organizations. The comrades working under the Party's organization should assist in the smooth progress of the recovery work. After the success of the national liberation struggle, industrial construction and economic revival will undoubtedly be one of the future directions of our labor movement. Therefore, in the future, in addition to engaging in the liberation of our own lives, labor organizations should also make greater efforts under the major themes of national economic recovery and industrial construction, so that the major labor masses, under the entire leadership of the Party, can follow the correct path and accelerate the completion of our labor's new mission. The unfolding of a new history naturally requires our labor's new strength to shine and enrich it. Our labor class has already made great efforts in this national liberation struggle, but under the new environment, we naturally need to continue our labor to increase our labor's position in the construction of the new China, so as to maintain our glorious past.</p>
<h3>A Record of Consolation Visits to the Pudong Concentration Camp</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhongying</p>
<p>Four Long Years</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, British and American expatriates in this city have been concentrated in Pudong, Yangshupu, and western Shanghai. During these four long years, given their usual comfortable lives and excellent environment in Shanghai, they inevitably felt some pain once they were interned. However, in fact, the treatment was acceptable, and it did not feel much different from the wartime life of ordinary soldiers.</p>
<p>However, it is human nature that when people have extreme freedom, they cannot appreciate the pain of being restricted. Conversely, once they are restricted, they feel the value of freedom. British and American expatriates were no exception during this period. Fortunately, they understood the current situation and were familiar with the trends of international warfare. Therefore, they were calm in their minds while in the camp. Watching the reflections across the river, although they had a sense of the past and present, they often felt the joy of the waxing and waning of life when strolling in the camp as the sun set and the moon rose.</p>
<p>Raising Funds for Consolation</p>
<p>Now that the war is over and peace is being rebuilt, British and American expatriates are waiting quietly to be released. Moreover, they have been detained for a long time, and they are even more in need of visits from outsiders. Dr. He Shizhen, a prominent figure in this city, was aware of this, and having studied in the United States in his early years and often socialized with British and American people after returning to China, he had deep feelings for them. He wanted to visit them, but was prevented by the circumstances and could not fulfill his wish. He often felt the sense of the wind and rain darkening, the monkeys chirping on the beams, and the falling moon. Now that the sky is clear and the rivers and mountains are about to return to their old appearance, he has organized a committee called the "International Friendship Association," with eleven members, including Zhang Shuping, Wang Renlin, Ai Guofan, Huang Youpeng, Zhang Qiangsheng, Ni Guangzu, and the author. He was publicly elected as the chairman, and Xie Xianyao of Jin Cheng Bank, Huang Nachuan of Daya Bank, and Liu Zhemin of Lianhua Bank were appointed as economic advisors. They began raising consolation funds from the previous period. Everything was ready by the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the committee members were divided and sent to various concentration camps with a letter of consolation signed by He to visit and express their condolences in person. The details of what happened are briefly described below, so that those in this city who are usually concerned about them can be comforted.</p>
<p>Details of Consolation Visits to Various Camps</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were originally three groups going to various concentration camps, but the author, Mr. Zhang Qiangsheng, and Jin Boming of Zhejiang Industrial Bank represented He to visit the Pudong camp to express their condolences.</p>
<p>At 2 p.m., we took a car to the Customs Wharf, and then took a small sampan to the other side. When we arrived at the shore, the consolers were already coming one after another. The three of us walked to the camp. The camp building was a three-story building with a large open space in the middle. Some people were shirtless, and some were wearing slippers and barefoot, creating a harmonious and relaxed atmosphere reminiscent of the countryside. On the second floor, we entered the office. The person in charge was Mr. Ayres, an Englishman. The American person in charge was originally Mr. Benoy, but he has resigned and was replaced by Mr. Brown. The three of us personally handed over a letter of consolation from He and gave them five checks, entrusting them to pass them on to the expatriates. Then, we expressed our condolences and were warmly received. We were then led to tour the entire camp. When the expatriates saw us, they came forward to shake hands and exchanged brief greetings. Then we went to the hall downstairs. At 4 p.m., we saw groups of people going to express their condolences, so we said goodbye and left.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Mr. Ayres and Mr. Brown asked us to convey their respect to Dr. He Shizhen and to tell the people in Puxi that they would return to the west bank within ten days and bow three times in admiration to the towering buildings on the other side of the river that were visible but unattainable, and to express their admiration to people from all walks of life on the sea.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Character of Free Talk</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The character of Free Talk has been briefly explained in the editor's foreword: "To freely discuss what one thinks, sees, and hears, and it must be beneficial to the public." In other words, while discussion is free, it must be beneficial to the public, or at least have some beneficial effect on readers.</p>
<p>Therefore, we do not dislike incisive and sharp writing that criticizes reality. However, indiscriminate and abusive writing, and writing that only offers negative attacks without positive suggestions, is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Secondly, casual writing that only talks about romantic topics is certainly loved by some readers, but in the current tense era, in the current small space, it is temporarily difficult to publish. On the contrary, short essays with humor and enlightenment, and literary works with profound meaning, are all welcome.</p>
<p>Because after reading the contributions from readers in the past few days, I feel that some of them have not met our goals, so I reiterate the above, and hope that my fellow writers will pay attention.</p>
<h3>A Short History of "Free Talk"</h3>
<p>— Chen Wei</p>
<p>This is a piece of exciting news—"Free Talk" has been relaunched! It has a long history in the history of vernacular literature.</p>
<p>It was once a venue for romantic talks of the Saturday School, and at another time a gathering place for concise and powerful "miscellaneous essays." In short, it is a supplement that has weathered many changes.</p>
<p>Based on available references, I will briefly discuss the history of "Free Talk":</p>
<p>"Free Talk" was first published on the first day of the seventh lunar month in the third year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong in the late Qing Dynasty, which corresponds to August 24, 1911 in the Gregorian calendar. It was initially edited by Wang Dungen, and the content consisted mainly of recreational texts for after-dinner enjoyment.</p>
<p>In March of the fourth year of the Republic of China, Wu Juemi took over as editor. He once briefly solicited poems and articles from military personnel to inspire a martial spirit among the people.</p>
<p>After exactly one year, Yao Changfu took over. This "supplement," the only one at the time, became a garden for members of the "Southern Society" to publish their poems and articles. In addition, a small garden called "Free Talk of Free Talk" was opened.</p>
<p>From the end of October in the fifth year of the Republic of China, Chen Xuyuan (also known as Tianxu Wosheng) took over the editorship. In addition to short essays, he also published some "family knowledge" that was popular with readers.</p>
<p>After the seventh year of the Republic of China, Tianxu Wosheng had become an industrialist, so Chen Lengxue edited it, focusing on short and concise essays.</p>
<p>From April 1, in the ninth year of the Republic of China, Zhou Shoujuan took over for twelve years. He published works that were very popular at the time, written entirely by famous literati in Shanghai. Looking at it now, it undoubtedly has the style of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the content was divided into categories such as "Casual Talks," "Miscellanea," "News Gleanings," "Travel Notes," "Drama Talks," "Leftovers," and "Trifles." In addition, there were long serial novels and anecdotes about literary figures.</p>
<p>At the end of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, Zhou edited a local supplement. At the beginning of the following year, in order to cater to the preferences of a certain group of readers, Zhou edited another supplement, "Spring and Autumn." The "Free Talk" section, however, underwent a sudden change, and was entirely written by promoters of new literature, truly marking the era when "Free Talk" shone brightly. The editor was Li Liewen, who had just returned from France and had new literary ideas. Regular contributors included Lu Xun, Yu Dafu, Cao Juren, Lao She, and others. At the same time, because of the emphasis on miscellaneous essays, many new writers were promoted, such as Kong Lingjing, Qian Xingcun, Shi Diancun, and Yong Tao. However, due to special circumstances, Lu Xun used many different pen names to submit articles, which can be found in the twentieth volume of his complete works.</p>
<p>Because the opinions were too radical, an announcement of "only talking about flowers, winds, and moonlight" had to be issued. The style gradually became bland, and then Zhang Zisheng took over the editorship until it was discontinued at the end of October of the twenty-fourth year. There were several intense debates, such as the problem of Zhuangzi as compulsory reading for students, the problem of the popular language, and the problem of humor, all of which were very famous and can be found in various collections of essays.</p>
<p>According to Hu Jiyuan's statistics, "Free Talk" lasted a total of twenty-four years and three months before the incident.</p>
<p>On the Double Tenth Festival in the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China, "Shen Bao" was relaunched in Shanghai, and Wang Renshu edited "Free Talk," which still had the "Lu Xun style."</p>
<p>Soon after, Hu Shanyuan took over as editor. The writers were mostly young literati, such as Ding Di and Wen Zongshan, whose writing style was not as skilled as the previous ones.</p>
<p>After more than a year, Huang Jia edited it, publishing Western humorous essays and scientific interests, with a style completely like the "Western Wind" magazine.</p>
<p>It was discontinued on December 8 of the thirtieth year. It was relaunched again in the thirty-first year, paying close attention to social problems in Shanghai. The essays mostly published texts on youth cultivation.</p>
<p>In the thirty-second year, due to space constraints, this garden was moved to the relaunched "Shen Bao Monthly." The "Free Talk" in the monthly lacked the previous vigor.</p>
<p>Until now, starting on the 20th, "Free Talk" has been relaunched again. We hope that it can move forward diligently, reflecting the wheels of this era, and we hope even more that this historically long-standing supplement can exist forever.</p>
<h3>Dawn</h3>
<p>— Lin Yi</p>
<p>The morning rooster has crowed, breaking the clear dawn,</p>
<p>Ten thousand creatures awaken from their slumber.</p>
<p>A round of morning glow,</p>
<p>Breaks through the overcast sky;</p>
<p>It is dancing, it is rejoicing, it is new life, it is vitality.</p>
<p>Look at the faint morning light!</p>
<p>Humanity once again steps forward with joyous steps,</p>
<p>Embarking on the journey to a new era.</p>
