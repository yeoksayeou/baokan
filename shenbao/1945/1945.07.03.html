<h3>峇厘巴板附近敵登陸　日守軍全力迎戰　包佛特市日軍亦阻敵前進</h3>
<p>峇厘巴板二日中央社電敵軍自上月十五日以來，即對峇厘巴板展開熾烈砲擊轟炸，歷時十六之久，企圖登陸，其後本月一日上午一時半，敵軍一部兵力於峇厘巴板北方五十公里之蘇坡嘉克拉碼顯附近登陸，並於同日上午九時許，在猛烈之砲擊轟炸掩護下，以大小登陸用舟　一百數十艘，企圖接近峇厘巴板地區，並於海岸街道市塲附近及千島三處開始登陸，目下該方面日守軍正與登陸敵軍展開激戰中。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地二日中央社電自敵軍企圖于婆羅洲島東南部峇厘巴板登陸以來，茲巳旬餘，其間敵軍之艦砲射擊，異常熾烈。一日晨八時許，終以登陸舟艇開始登陸，首先登陸之兵力，約有五千名，刻正陸續增强，日守軍對此亦傾舉全力迎戰中。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地二日中央社電二十六日以來，敵會小型舟試行偵察峇厘巴板海岸之日軍陣地，至二十九日復增加艦船於該地沿海岸蠢動，該日傍晚即發見近海有大型巡洋艦五艘，驅逐艦十二艘，掃海艇三十一艘，油槽船二艘，工作船一艘，共計五十一艘，至三十日拂曉時，敵艦果然對日軍陣地開始熾烈砲擊，同時，並有B24　B29等大中型機編隊相繼而來，施行執抝轟炸，其後未幾，舟艇即欲開始登陸，於是雙方之砲擊戰隨而逐加激烈。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地二日中央社電布爾內灣之敵，二十四日乘舟艇溯航巴達斯河，而于包佛特登陸，經當地日軍與之交戰後，將其擊退。二十八日敵軍復于空軍及重砲掩護下，再于該地西方二公里附近登陸，逐次企圖向包佛特市前進，該地日軍勇敢迎戰，肉搏攻敵，予敵極大損害，而阻止其前進。</p>
<h3>日外相歡宴菲總統　席間互申決意</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電日東鄉外相兼大東亞相。二十八日下午六時假座帝國飯店，歡宴菲島洛勒爾大總統，席間由東鄕外相及勒爾總統先後致詞</p>
<p>東鄉外相致詞</p>
<p>現出席此宴會之洛勒爾總統及其他各位，均為實現菲島獨立及進而建設大東亞共榮圈而敢然與帝國協力，於大東亞戰爭貢獻至鉅，帝國朝野對此殊表感激。最近敵英。美再度侵略菲島，該方面戰况頗告急迫，然帝國完成戰爭之決意絕不因此稍有動搖，帝國政府已在大東亞共同宜言及大東亞大使會議共同聲明中，迭次闡明務求理想實現，即使大東亞由英。美之榨取獲得解放，使大東亞各國家民族各得其所，確保大東亞之安定，以促進世界之全面和平。爲達到此目的起見，決澈底摧毀英。美對東亞所抱之野心，不達目的誓不罷手，余對菲律賓國之獨立，始終表示擁護，同時並祈禱各位事業成功。</p>
<p>洛勒爾總統詞</p>
<p>日本對於菲島共和國之獨立援助至大，余不獨以菲島大總統資格，且代表全體菲島國民，　表對意。余深信大東亞各民族應由西歐之支配獲得解放，此項犧牲。吾人應付之犧牲縱不論任何重大，吾人如能忍受犧牲，則吾人之子孫始能生存繁榮。敵人或欲奪取吾人之生命，敵人之轟炸或欲毀滅吾人之肉體，然吾人必須獲得自由，不准他人干涉，亞洲應爲亞細亞人之亞洲，菲島應一爲菲律賓人之菲島。</p>

<h3>廣州市被炸　死傷十餘人</h3>
<p>廣州二日中央社電</p>
<p>二日零時五十分，敵機一批侵入市空，向東堤警察分局轄內住宅區投下燃燒彈十餘枚，火光熊熊，其勢頗烈。肇事時，當局即派出全體消防總隊人員，警察及保安警察，同時盟邦亦派出軍憲坊護團等，分顯搶救，未幾即將火撲滅。當塲救出民甚多，此次死傷人數達十五名，輕傷五名，重傷八名，毀屋約十餘所，一般市民對敵機之暴行憤慨異常。</p>

<h3>美太平洋作戰煤油消耗激增</h3>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電誇稱物資雄厚之美國，應為繼蒙受龐大消耗，業現焦慮之色，尤以太平洋戰綫之燃料缺乏，更爲顯著。據二十九日紐約加納爾報關於努力對太平洋戰綫補充燃料之美國太平洋沿岸情况，論述如次：運往前綫之煤油，目下正於南加利福尼亞州諸港上貨，現在利用油　船運往太平洋前綫之煤油量，每月平均可達一千四百萬桶，爲前年及大前年量數之二倍以上。據煤汕關係當局者推測，現在於太平洋所消費之煤油量，當超過歐戰終了以前於歐洲及太平洋兩戰域所消費之油量，此概因太平洋戰綫僅用海軍戰爭，故尤須巨大之補充船，而補充船自體亦消費巨量燃料與內燃機關油。此外，隨同轟炸戰鬥之日趨熾烈，飛機使用之汽油亦逐日增加，爲應付此龐大之需要，是必加强採取加利福尼亞油田之煤汕。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>宋子文莫斯科之行</h3>
<p>重慶行政院長兼外交部長宋于文偕同外次故世澤等一行，於六月三十日飛抵莫斯科，當日即與史太林莫洛托夫等舉行會談，這一消息之引起注目和猜測，自不待言。</p>
<p>對於這個消息可以注意的有三點：第一，宋子文這次赴蘇活動，是渝國民黨第六次全國代表大會通過的加强中蘇外交關係案的實踐；，第二，是宋子文這次赴蘇携有隨員達五十人之多，幾乎出動參加舊金山會議的同樣多的人馬：第三，這次渝蘇會談，正在宣傳將於日內在柏林郊外德國皇宮舉行的三頭會議前夕。</p>
<p>由於上述三點，我們可以推想這次渝蘇會談的重要性，自不待言。關於宋子文等此行的使命，雖然尙無充分消息可資證實，但就今日內外大局而觀，一般推斷，不外有下列數點：</p>
<p>第一，改善渝蘇關係問題；渝蘇關係，自一九三七年成立不侵犯協定以後，雖曾一度好轉，其後三年間，蘇聯對渝以物物交換方式之物資援助，曾有相當多的數目。這種關係，直到一九四〇年冬各地渝共衝突事件復發及一九四一年新春皖南事件，始吿終結，是年四月乃即有日蘇中立協定成立。自此以後，渝蘇關係即告逆轉；加以德蘇戰起，蘇聯方有事於西方，對渝關係更陷於中絕狀態。而重慶方面反蘇運動亦與日俱增，一九四三年冬之新疆外蒙邊境衝突，一九四四年春日蘇新約之成立，尤爲渝蘇關係惡劣之露骨表現。但自今年歐戰急轉以來，重慶於蘇聯對於世界大局之決定的新地位，內心愈感不安與威脅，乃急謀乘機調整關係，以防蘇聯轉變態度而援助中共。這次宋子文等之赴蘇，這種防禦性的對蘇外交使命，是最主要的一點。</p>
<p>第二，調停渝共關係問題：固然，蘇聯政府一再聲明不干涉任何國家的內政，然而，實際上不希望其鄰國為反蘇的防疫隔離地帶，則早已見諸蘇聯近來各種外交文獻，因此，對於渝共衝突日趨劇烈之現狀，近來已不避嫌疑而在其機關報上一再加以指　。蘇聯一切對渝批判的主要材料，都是和中共通過新華社所發表的言論，如出一轍。也因此，要澈底解決渝共關係，至少在重慶方面，大部分實力派領袖，是主張和蘇聯直接交涉的。宋子文等此行的第二重大任務，當然就是這一點。</p>
<p>第三，關於英美渝開始對日對中國大陸總反攻的計劃，近來已有種種展開的徵兆，而届時蘇聯的能度，實爲重慶最大憂慮所在。這一個嚴重的問題，宋子文等在參加舊金山會議之後，回國之前，即曾與英美負資代表進行協商，並赴華盛頓與特魯曼交換意見，那時國際間已有宋子文赴蘇的傳說，不過茲事體大，宋子文在未明蔣介石及渝方實力派領袖的意見之前。未能獨斷自主，所以先行回渝協商，再行赴蘇。其備有詳細對蘇交涉腹案，殆無疑義。</p>
<p>除了第三層，關涉到渝共關係以外，勢將待柏林三頭會議以後始有解決可能，宋子文的對蘇　動只有提供一方面的腹案的意義；其第一第二兩種使命，我們就現有資料推斷，似乎不會有什麼重大的收獲可言。因爲，第一，重慶的到蘇活動，是防禦性的及消極性的，要旨只希望在改善渝蘇關係的名目之下，使蘇聯對渝方對內對外政策，不致干涉。然而蘇聯對渝，決不以此為滿足。第二，關於調整渝共問題，渝方德先決條件無論如何不允中共有獨立政權和軍隊，而中共的先決條件，必須成立所謂民主聯合政府，中共實際參加，因雙方各有先決條件，中共的聯合政府主張無異否定了蔣宋一系支配的重慶政權，渝方怎能答允呢？　美又怎能答允呢？</p>

<h3>江北之新港</h3>
<p>— 陳庭</p>
<p>靖江縣重要城市——新港。位居長江之北，張黃港以西，對望江陰縣，該處江面較狹，地勢險要，不亞於江陰。</p>
<p>自事變以後，長江沿海一整，民風漸趨强悍，旅客於長江間往返，時有海盜搶刧之危，且目前輪船不通，來往悉由帆船搭客，旅客所受生命財物之損失，不可勝數，爲害之劇，殆非局外人所能想像者。</p>
<p>筆者此次隨新港保護豬船至申之水營隊返新，以彼等各持有武器，頓覺安心不少；此日適遇西北風　，帆船航行甚緩，至第三日始達新港。沿途泊宿於狼山，天生港，張　港各處，夜間水警隊員輪流站崗，全夜吆喝聲槍聲不絕。</p>
<p>商業情形</p>
<p>新港鎮市頗熱鬧，商店攤販林立，尤以攤販比比皆是。該地事變時全鎭曾一度燒光，現有房屋悉為新造者，全鎭巾樓房僅二三幢，餘爲平房，商業以豬，食油，蛋，米之出口及日用百貨，烟紙，食糖等之進口為大宗，有名之江北豬之出口，新港也爲重要集中地之一，故而鎭中多豬行及運輸公司，彼此均有密切關係，緣因運輸公司所經營者皆爲豬之出口也。</p>
<p>又以上海新港間物價相差甚大，故貼水之風極盛，如以七萬元交於新港之豬行或運輸公司，以所出之票子，至滬即能領得十萬元。</p>
<p>其餘各物進出口都係單幫客人所携帶，聞獲利頗厚。該地米價一月前爲廿　萬，爲上海米價之一半大約爲上海之半價，惟該處日用百雜貨悉賴上海，較之滬地昂貴倍餘，交通之困難業為促成其昂貴只大原因。</p>
<p>江北河流殊稀，水分不足，以致出產不豐，產稻甚少，所產米質也劣，佳者當地人稱「飯米」，係江陰所產而運入者，即上海人稱「杜米」者，農民泰半以種麥爲主，養豬之風也盛，大部均係運至上海者。</p>
<p>新港四郊農民生活甚苦，又加以出產不豐，食物均依小麥·大麥·喬麥·高粱等粉末煮糊以進，貧者則以胡蘿葡（紅蘇葡）或佐以甘薯爲食，實胡蘿葡中多維他命，鄉人識淺，苦不得而知耳。</p>
<p>該地人多食河豚魚，未聞有一人致死者，想係擅長殺法食法之放，其血。子。眼睛等，均捨之不食，加以豬油，冰糖，醬等極多，悶一日夜食之，其味甘　　當，魚價甚貴，食一　河豚魚約須十萬金，故平民食者殊　，遇有重大宴會，始一出納人。唯筆者食之，但覺其肉粗　，魚味與人傳者適反。</p>
<p>交通治安</p>
<p>至滬有帆船，或擺渡至江陰，再由陸路至上海。至靖江縣城有單座三輪車通行，車價約為一萬元，其餘至各鄉鎮，大都　手推之獨輸車。</p>
<p>教育程度極差，全鎮只小學校一所，中學須至靖江城鎮南中始有，故鄉人文化水準甚低。</p>
<p>新港藉勢敲詐之風甚烈，尤以對于滬來單幫客人為甚，目前輸船停止駛行，彼等之收入已一落千丈矣！</p>
<p>出新港四五里之鄉間，即入另一勢力圈內，青年農民大部為民兵，如有形跡可疑者，必仔細盤結，始放通行。</p>

<h3>Enemy Landing Near Balikpapan; Japanese Garrison Fully Engaged; Japanese Troops at Beaufort Also Hinder Enemy Advance</h3>
<p>Balikpapan, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the 15th of last month, enemy forces have launched intense artillery fire and bombing on Balikpapan for as long as sixteen days, attempting to land. Subsequently, at 1:30 AM on the 1st of this month, a portion of enemy forces landed near Supokajakrama, 50 kilometers north of Balikpapan. Furthermore, at approximately 9:00 AM on the same day, under the cover of intense artillery fire and bombing, they attempted to approach the Balikpapan area with over one hundred landing craft of various sizes, and began landing at three locations: near the coastal streets, markets, and Thousand Islands. Currently, the Japanese garrison in that area is engaged in fierce fighting with the landing enemy forces.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - It has been over ten days since enemy forces attempted to land at Balikpapan in the southeastern part of Borneo Island. During this period, the enemy's naval gun fire has been extraordinarily intense. At approximately 8:00 AM on the 1st, they finally began landing with landing boats. The initial landing force numbered approximately 5,000 troops, and is currently being continuously reinforced. The Japanese garrison is also exerting its full strength to engage the enemy.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the 26th, enemy small boats have been conducting reconnaissance of the Japanese military positions on the coast of Balikpapan. By the 29th, they had increased the number of ships prowling along the coast in that area. That evening, five large cruisers, twelve destroyers, thirty-one minesweepers, two oil tankers, and one work ship, totaling fifty-one vessels, were discovered near the coast. At dawn on the 30th, the enemy ships indeed began intense artillery fire on the Japanese military positions. At the same time, squadrons of large and medium-sized aircraft, such as B24 and B29, arrived in succession to conduct persistent bombing. Shortly thereafter, the boats attempted to begin landing, and the artillery battle between the two sides gradually intensified.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy at Brunei Bay sailed up the Padas River in boats on the 24th and landed at Beaufort. After the local Japanese troops engaged them, they were repelled. On the 28th, under the cover of air force and heavy artillery, the enemy again landed near the west of that area, two kilometers away, and gradually attempted to advance towards Beaufort City. The Japanese troops in that area bravely engaged them, attacking the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, inflicting great damage on the enemy, and preventing their advance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Hosts Banquet for Philippine President; Mutual Declarations of Resolve During the Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese Foreign Minister and Minister for Greater East Asia, Tōgō Shigenori, hosted a banquet for Philippine President José Laurel at the Imperial Hotel at 6:00 PM on the 28th. During the banquet, Foreign Minister Tōgō and President Laurel delivered speeches in turn.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Tōgō's Speech:</p>
<p>President Laurel and all of you present at this banquet have resolutely cooperated with the Empire to realize the independence of the Philippines and further build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, making significant contributions to the Greater East Asia War. The Empire, both the government and the people, express deep gratitude for this. Recently, the enemy British and Americans have again invaded the Philippines, and the war situation there is quite urgent. However, the Empire's determination to complete the war will not be shaken in the slightest. The Empire's government has repeatedly clarified in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the joint statement of the Greater East Asia Ambassadors' Conference that it seeks to realize its ideals, even if it means liberating Greater East Asia from the exploitation of Britain and the United States, enabling each nation and ethnicity of Greater East Asia to find its place, ensuring the stability of Greater East Asia, and promoting comprehensive world peace. To achieve this goal, we are determined to thoroughly destroy the ambitions of Britain and the United States toward East Asia, and we will not stop until we achieve our objective. I have always expressed support for the independence of the Philippines, and I also pray for the success of your endeavors.</p>
<p>President Laurel's Speech:</p>
<p>Japan has provided great assistance to the independence of the Republic of the Philippines. Not only as the President of the Philippines, but also on behalf of all Filipino citizens, I express my deep gratitude. I firmly believe that the peoples of Greater East Asia should be liberated from the domination of Western Europe. No matter how great the sacrifices we must pay for this, we should endure them so that our children and grandchildren can survive and prosper. The enemy may want to take our lives, and the enemy's bombing may want to destroy our physical bodies, but we must obtain freedom and not allow others to interfere. Asia should be Asia for Asians, and the Philippines should be the Philippines for Filipinos.</p>

<h3>Huang Yanpei and Others Visit Yan'an</h3>

As the date of the National Political Council meeting is imminent, their movements are attracting attention.</p>
<h3>US Pacific War Theater Coal Oil Consumption Surges</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The United States, which boasts abundant resources, is showing signs of anxiety due to the huge consumption it is enduring, especially the fuel shortage in the Pacific front. According to a New York Journal report on the 29th regarding the efforts of the United States' Pacific coast to replenish fuel to the Pacific front, the following is stated: The coal oil being transported to the front is currently being loaded at ports in Southern California. The amount of coal oil currently being transported to the Pacific front using oil tankers averages 14 million barrels per month, which is more than twice the amount in the previous two years. According to authorities in the coal oil sector, the amount of coal oil currently consumed in the Pacific is expected to exceed the amount consumed in both the European and Pacific war zones before the end of the European war. This is mainly because the Pacific front is solely a naval war, so huge replenishment ships are needed, and the replenishment ships themselves also consume huge amounts of fuel and internal combustion engine oil. In addition, as bombing battles become more intense, the gasoline used by aircraft is also increasing daily. To meet this huge need, it is necessary to strengthen the extraction of coal oil from the California oil fields.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Military Police Joint Inspection Office</h3>
<p>Wuhu, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Joint Military Police Inspection Office of this county was officially established on the 1st.

<h3>Explanation of Bail Procedures for Criminal Defendants by Vice Minister Zhao</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Judicial Administration promulgated the Bail Procedures for Criminal Defendants, all courts and prosecutors' offices have been ordered to comply, greatly easing the overcrowding in detention centers. However, the parties involved are not yet fully aware of the procedures. Vice Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Judicial Administration recently convened the President of the Shanghai Higher Court and the presiding judge of the criminal division to provide a detailed explanation to avoid misunderstandings. The "but" clause in Article 3 of the procedures is only a "but" clause for this article, meaning that defendants charged with the crimes listed in Article 2 should, in principle, be detained and this "but" clause does not apply. Even if the defendants listed in Article 2 meet the conditions of the "but" clauses in Article 3, detention is still the principle. This "but" clause only refers to defendants other than those listed in Article 2 who should be released on bail if they meet the conditions of any of the clauses, and it does not apply as an exception to Article 2. The application of Clause 3 of the "but" clause is the responsibility of the presiding judge. If Clause 4 of the procedures is applicable, the approval of the superior must be obtained first, and a written ruling must be made.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Trip to Moscow</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, Premier and Foreign Minister of Chongqing, along with Deputy Foreign Minister Hu Shize and a group of others, arrived in Moscow on June 30th and held talks with Stalin and Molotov on the same day. It goes without saying that this news has attracted attention and speculation.</p>
<p>There are three points to note about this news: First, Song Ziwen's trip to the Soviet Union is a practical implementation of the proposal to strengthen Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations passed by the Sixth National Congress of the Chongqing Kuomintang; second, Song Ziwen's delegation to the Soviet Union consists of as many as fifty people, almost as many as the delegation that participated in the San Francisco Conference; third, this Chongqing-Soviet meeting is taking place on the eve of the Three-Power Conference, which is said to be held in the German Imperial Palace in the suburbs of Berlin.</p>
<p>Because of the above three points, we can imagine the importance of this Chongqing-Soviet meeting. Although there is not enough information available to confirm the mission of Song Ziwen and his party, judging from the current domestic and international situation, the general speculation is that it consists of the following points:</p>
<p>First, the issue of improving Chongqing-Soviet relations: Chongqing-Soviet relations, after the establishment of the non-aggression pact in 1937, once improved. In the subsequent three years, the Soviet Union provided Chongqing with a considerable amount of material assistance in the form of barter trade. This relationship came to an end with the recurrence of Chongqing-Communist conflicts in various places in the winter of 1940 and the Anhui Incident in the spring of 1941. The Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact was then established in April of that year. Since then, Chongqing-Soviet relations have reversed. In addition, with the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union was preoccupied with the West, and its relations with Chongqing were further interrupted. The anti-Soviet movement in Chongqing also increased day by day. The Xinjiang-Outer Mongolia border conflict in the winter of 1943 and the establishment of the new Japanese-Soviet treaty in the spring of 1944 were blatant expressions of the deteriorating Chongqing-Soviet relations. However, since the rapid turn of events in the European war this year, Chongqing has increasingly felt uneasy and threatened by the Soviet Union's new position in determining the world situation, and it is eager to seize the opportunity to adjust relations to prevent the Soviet Union from changing its attitude and assisting the CCP. This trip to the Soviet Union by Song Ziwen and his party, this defensive diplomatic mission to the Soviet Union, is the most important point.</p>
<p>Second, the issue of mediating Chongqing-Communist relations: Of course, the Soviet government has repeatedly stated that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. However, in practice, it does not want its neighbors to be anti-Soviet buffer zones, as has been seen in various Soviet diplomatic documents in recent times. Therefore, it has recently been increasingly critical of the increasingly fierce Chongqing-Communist conflict in its official newspapers. All of the Soviet Union's main materials for criticizing Chongqing are the same as the remarks made by the CCP through the Xinhua News Agency. Therefore, to thoroughly resolve the Chongqing-Communist relationship, at least on the Chongqing side, most of the powerful leaders advocate direct negotiations with the Soviet Union. Song Ziwen's second major task on this trip is, of course, this point.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the plans of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing to launch a general counteroffensive against Japan in mainland China, there have been various signs of development recently, and the Soviet Union's capabilities at that time are Chongqing's greatest concern. This serious issue was discussed by Song Ziwen and other representatives of Britain and the United States after attending the San Francisco Conference and before returning home, and he exchanged views with Truman in Washington. At that time, there were rumors in the international community that Song Ziwen would go to the Soviet Union, but since this matter was of great importance, Song Ziwen could not make a decision on his own before clarifying the opinions of Chiang Kai-shek and the leaders of the Chongqing faction. Therefore, he first returned to Chongqing to consult and then went to the Soviet Union. It is almost certain that he has a detailed plan for negotiations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Except for the third level, which is related to Chongqing-Communist relations, it will likely be resolved only after the Berlin Three-Power Conference. Song Ziwen's actions towards the Soviet Union only have the significance of providing a one-sided plan. Judging from the existing materials, it seems that his first and second missions will not have any major gains. Because, first, Chongqing's actions towards the Soviet Union are defensive and passive, and the main purpose is only to hope that under the guise of improving Chongqing-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union will not interfere in Chongqing's domestic and foreign policies. However, the Soviet Union will never be satisfied with this. Second, regarding the adjustment of the Chongqing-Communist issue, the Chongqing side's prerequisite is that the CCP will not be allowed to have an independent government and army, while the CCP's prerequisite is that a so-called democratic coalition government must be established, and the CCP must actually participate. Because the two sides have different prerequisites, the CCP's proposal for a coalition government is tantamount to negating the Chongqing regime dominated by the Chiang-Song faction. How can Chongqing agree to this? How can the United States agree to this?</p>
<p>Local Correspondences</p>
<h3>Xin Port of Jiangbei</h3>
<p>— Chen Ting</p>
<p>Xin Port is an important city in Jingjiang County. It is located north of the Yangtze River, west of Zhanghuang Port, facing Jiangyin County. The river surface there is relatively narrow and the terrain is dangerous, no less than Jiangyin.</p>
<p>Since the Incident, the coastal areas of the Yangtze River have been reorganized and the local customs have gradually become more robust. Passengers traveling back and forth on the Yangtze River are often at risk of piracy and robbery. Moreover, there are currently no steamboats, and all travel is by sailboat. The loss of life and property suffered by passengers is countless. The severity of the harm is almost unimaginable to outsiders.</p>
<p>This time, I accompanied the Xin Port protection pig boat from the Shanghai Water Patrol Team back to Xin Port. Since they all had weapons, I felt much safer. On this day, we encountered a northwest wind, and the sailboat traveled very slowly. It was not until the third day that we reached Xin Port. Along the way, we docked at Langshan, Tiansheng Port, and Zhangdian Port. At night, the members of the Water Police Team took turns on guard, and the shouts and gunshots continued all night.</p>
<p>Commercial Situation</p>
<p>The town of Xin Port is quite lively, with shops and stalls lining the streets, especially the latter. The entire town was burned down during the Incident, and the existing houses are all newly built. There are only two or three buildings in the entire town, and the rest are bungalows. Commerce mainly involves the export of pigs, edible oil, eggs, and rice, and the import of daily necessities, cigarettes, sugar, etc. The export of the famous Jiangbei pigs is one of the important concentration points of Xin Port. Therefore, there are many pig firms and transportation companies in the town, and they all have close relationships with each other, because the transportation companies all operate the export of pigs.</p>
<p>In addition, the price difference between Shanghai and Xin Port is very large, so the practice of discounts is very popular. For example, if 70,000 yuan is paid to a pig firm or transportation company in Xin Port, the bills issued can be exchanged for 100,000 yuan in Shanghai.</p>
<p>All other imports and exports are carried by individual peddlers, who are said to make a lot of profit. The price of rice there was 200,000 yuan a month ago, which is about half the price of rice in Shanghai. However, all daily necessities are reliant on Shanghai, and they are more than twice as expensive as in Shanghai. The difficulty of transportation is the main reason for its high cost.</p>
<p>Rivers in Jiangbei are very scarce, and there is insufficient water, resulting in poor production. Very little rice is produced, and the quality of the rice is also poor. The better quality is called "fan mi" (rice for eating) by the locals, which is produced in Jiangyin and transported in. It is what the Shanghai people call "du mi" (special rice). Most of the farmers mainly grow wheat, and pig farming is also popular. Most of the pigs are transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The farmers in the suburbs of Xin Port live a very hard life. In addition to poor production, they mainly eat porridge made from wheat, barley, buckwheat, sorghum, and other flours. The poor eat carrots (red sweet potatoes) or sweet potatoes. In fact, carrots are rich in vitamins, but the villagers are ignorant and do not know it.</p>
<p>The locals eat puffer fish a lot, and I have not heard of anyone dying from it. I guess they are good at killing and eating it. They discard the blood, eggs, and eyes, and add a lot of lard, rock sugar, and sauce, and simmer it for a day and a night before eating it. The taste is sweet and delicious. The price of fish is very expensive. Eating one puffer fish costs about 100,000 gold, so ordinary people rarely eat it. It is only served at major banquets. However, when I ate it, I only felt that the meat was coarse and the taste of the fish was the opposite of what people said.</p>
<p>Transportation and Security</p>
<p>To Shanghai, there are sailboats, or ferries to Jiangyin, and then by land to Shanghai. To the county town of Jingjiang, there are single-seat tricycles, and the fare is about 10,000 yuan. To other towns and villages, most people use hand-pushed wheelbarrows.</p>
<p>The level of education is very poor. There is only one elementary school in the entire town. For middle school, you have to go to the Zhennan Middle School in Jingjiang Town. Therefore, the cultural level of the villagers is very low.</p>
<p>The practice of extortion in Xin Port is very prevalent, especially towards individual peddlers from Shanghai. Currently, the shipping of boats has stopped, and their income has plummeted!</p>
<p>Four or five li out of Xin Port into the countryside, you enter another sphere of influence. Most of the young farmers are militiamen. If there are suspicious people, they must carefully search and interrogate them before letting them pass.</p>
<p>I stayed in the port for half a month this time, and then transferred from Jiangyin through Wuxi back to Shanghai. The cost was only one day and night. Thinking about the difficulty of going out now, I can't help but feel the difference between the present and the past.</p>
<h3>British and American Troops Withdraw to New Boundary in Germany</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to messages received here: "In order to fulfill the agreement of the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and the four countries jointly occupying Berlin, the British troops in the Baltic Sea and Mecklenburg began to withdraw from the northeastern region of Germany yesterday morning." According to reports, this area has been occupied by British troops since the German army surrendered to General Montgomery. At the same time, except for slight changes in the British troops stationed in the demarcation line between the British and Soviet occupation zones, there are said to be large-scale troop movements in the southern region. It is reported that this large-scale movement of troops and defensive positions is based on an agreement between British Prime Minister Churchill, Soviet Chairman Stalin, and the late US President Roosevelt. The city of Wismar on the Baltic Sea, formerly occupied by the British Sixth Division, is now under the jurisdiction of the Soviet authorities. Currently, the new British demarcation line runs from the north around to the southwest and the eastern part of Lübeck, ending in the southwest of the Elbe River. At the same time, Soviet troops moved into the Baltic region withdrawn by the British troops last night. The region is 27 kilometers wide and 40 kilometers long, including the important towns of Schwerin, Röteveck, Sloster, Hagenow, Schaanberg, part of Lütowburg, and the main port city of Wismar in the region.</p>

<h3>People's Food Regulation Committee Decides on Methods for Procuring Coarse Grains; All Organizations Including Industry and Commerce Can Participate Individually</h3>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee and the Essential Commodities Subcommittee held a joint meeting on the 27th of last month to discuss the procurement of food and regulation of the people's food supply in the city. It was decided to establish the "Shanghai Special Municipality People's Food Regulation Committee" to implement the measures, and Li Sihao and eight others were elected as members, which has been approved by the Municipal Government. The People's Food Regulation Committee convened its first meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday, attended by Li Sihao, Hu Zewu, Liu Xingchen, Xiang Kangyuan, Sun Yaodong, Dai [illegible], Chen Bin [illegible], etc. Chaired by Li Sihao, the following methods for procuring coarse grains in the first phase were decided upon:</p>
<p>Decided Methods</p>
<p>A fund of one million yuan will be established, half of which will be divided into ten thousand units, each unit being fifty yuan, to be subscribed by various civil organizations and institutions. The other half will be raised by the Municipal Government for general distribution purposes.</p>
<p>All organizations in industry and commerce (factories, shops), schools, cultural institutions, hospitals, and other organizations can participate individually. Each group of 20 people can subscribe to one unit. Any institution or organization can subscribe to [illegible]</p>
<p>The coarse grains will mainly consist of wheat flour, and other types of coarse grains will be evenly distributed by the committee.</p>
<p>The procurement period is approximately one and a half months, but the coarse grains will be dispatched as they arrive, with the order of distribution based on the order of payment.</p>
<p>The payment period is from July 5th to the 20th, and no payments will be accepted after the deadline.</p>
<p>Payments should be made at the Bank of Shanghai Rehabilitation and its branches, and coarse grains should be collected from the Bureau of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>The dates for collecting coarse grains will be announced in newspapers.</p>
<p>The price of the coarse grains and transportation costs will be shared equally by the participating organizations and institutions. At the end of the first phase of procurement, the committee will publicly report all accounts.</p>
<p>The methods for procuring coarse grains this time are slightly different from the previous price-controlled rice initiatives. For example, previously [illegible] tragic family groups, industry and commerce were targeted at [illegible] trade associations. This time, industry and commerce participate directly and individually, without going through trade associations. [Illegible] payments can also be made by promissory note. All of this is for the convenience of organizations to participate and [illegible] consideration for the people's food supply. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention.</p>
<h3>All Banks and Firms to Stop Using Funds Transfer Orders Starting Today; Those Issued Previously Should Be Recalled as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>The funds transfer orders issued by banks, money shops, and the Central Reserve Bank in the city have been circulating well in the market. However, some banks and firms have been issuing them excessively, often creating empty promises. To prevent credit expansion, the Central Reserve Bank ordered the banks and money shops to recall them within a limited time and to eliminate the opportunity for counterfeit funds transfer orders to be mixed in. It is understood that all banks and firms will uniformly stop using and issuing these funds transfer orders starting today (3rd). All previously issued funds transfer orders will also be recalled as much as possible starting today and will no longer be circulated. For deposits withdrawn by fellow merchants and customers, it has also been decided to prioritize payment in cash. The remaining amount will be replaced by issuing each bank's own cashier's checks, each check having parallel horizontal lines indicating that it is an immediate payment cashier's check and additionally stamped with a limited presentation period of ten days. This measure is purely to prevent empty promises and counterfeiting. It is expected that the cash position required by banks and firms starting today will be particularly relaxed compared to last month.</p>

<h3>Municipal Counties to Organize Field Tax Supervision Teams</h3>
<p>The collection of in-kind field taxes in this city this year has been set to begin on June 1st. The issue of storage is extremely important. The Organizational Rules for Grain Storage Warehouses for Field Tax Collection in Various Counties, stipulating the responsibilities of the county head, have already been promulgated and implemented. Therefore, the county head is naturally responsible for the storage and preservation of all field taxes that have been collected. However, the Municipal Field Tax Management Section, in order to ensure the Zheng [illegible] of the matter, submitted a proposal for discussion at this administrative meeting in order to promote special attention and achieve completeness. At the same time, the County Administration Office proposed the organization of field tax supervision teams, composed of various organizations from the various counties, because the collection of in-kind field taxes in the counties of this city is a new venture, and all payment procedures are more cumbersome than in the past. There are many businesses in each county, and some may not fully understand and are waiting to see. In order to ensure smooth collection and prevent abuses, they should engage in publicity, supervision, and rectification of sluggishness during the field tax collection period, which will benefit the collection number and timing.</p>

<h3>Promulgation and Implementation by the Municipal Government: Organizational Regulations for County Administration Advisory Council</h3>

<h3>Education Lecture Registration Deadline, Home Tutors Welcome to Apply, Yizhong School Opening Continuing Textbook Collection</h3>
<p>The "Home Tutor Training Class" organized by this newspaper's Obligatory Education Committee was completed some days ago. Forty students and more than ten auditors attended the training, undeterred by the summer heat, and never interrupted. Their dedication to research is particularly commendable. There have been many letters and telegrams from all walks of life requesting appointments, and the Committee is carefully selecting and will recommend them soon. However, there are still many vacancies, and it is hoped that all circles in the state will send letters requesting appointments, clearly stating the address, telephone number, the number of children to be tutored, their level, and the time. Can lunch and dinner be provided? What is the teaching salary? So that we may be in touch.</p>
<p>The "Education Lecture" at this office will begin on the 8th of this month. We are now inviting experts and preparing all necessary matters. All qualified primary school teachers who are interested in further study must register in person at this office within the next two days. The quota is set at two hundred, and there are not many places remaining.</p>
<p>Also, the First Obligatory Middle School held its entrance and grade placement examination on the 1st. More than one hundred people participated. The examination results have also been completely graded. The general level is above average, and there are quite a few outstanding individuals, which is enough to distinguish the poor children. Outstanding and promising people are everywhere. In the afternoon of the same day, a physical examination was held, presided over by Dr. Ye from Tongde Medical College and student Leng Yi and others. According to reports, their health levels are higher than those of the students who cause trouble, and very few are sick, which shows that suburban life is more reasonable than urban life. Yesterday (the 2nd) was the official opening day, with a total of about eighty students in four grades. Two grades are taking classes at No. 55 Lushan Road, and the other two grades are at No. 10 Hejiaqiao, Fahua East Town. The school buildings are all spacious, and there are still many vacancies, so we continue to recruit new male and female students. Several people came to the school yesterday to donate textbooks, but because there are many different types, we still hope that students from all schools will donate generously to meet the urgent need.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Fellow-Provincials Association Raises Money for Student Aid</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai has been running both the Student Aid Fund and Small Loan Fund Committees smoothly for the past five years.

<p>The Shanghai Tongren Fuyuantang Summer Free Clinic will begin dispensing medicine on July 2nd at its branch at No. 6 East Taishan Road, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day. Yesterday, we received a donation of free medicine certificates, and were instructed to distribute them to the poor and sick to enable them to seek medical treatment with the certificates. However, medicines have recently become expensive, so we hope that philanthropists will generously donate to support it.</p>
<p>Chen Boxian, a fifth-generation family doctor from Nantong, specializing in internal and external medicine for men, women, and children, plans to treat several poor patients every day from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, without charging consultation fees. Formal consultations are from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, regardless of the consultation fee. His residence is at No. 26 Cihou North Lane, Hatong Road.
