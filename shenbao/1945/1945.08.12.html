<h3 id="c9">敬告上海市民 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 羅君强</p>
<p>自從本月十日晚間，各方廣播放送日本的和平消息以後，苦於八九年戰禍的上海市民，不免驚喜若狂，進也是人之常情，原不足怪。但是據我所知道的，十一日這一天的情况，有些人感情過份衝動，做出一點越軌的幼稚的行動，恐怕也難免有少數流氓地痞，利用羣衆激昂的情緒，故意滋生一些事端，冀圖混水摸魚，趁火打刼。</p>
<p>本市許多有識之士，都認爲這些現象是不應該有的，而且必需糾正的，市府會同保安司令部動員全體警察，保甲人員，及自警團，以至保安督察大隊和保安特務團，分區分段嚴密維持秩序。對於一切市上所不應有的現象，隨時隨地加以糾正。縱就一部份淺見的市民對我們有什麼誤解和苛責，我們亦祇有揮淚來執行我們的木然職責了。</p>
<p>十一日下午六時半，本人代表周市長會見現地日本軍松井司令官，承他告訴我截止談話時爲止，他亦祇聽了一些廣播的消息，並未接得柬京政府或駐華總軍司令部任何關於和平的訓令。我們平心想想：百萬大軍出國遠征，在沒有奉到木國最高統帥機關的正確命令以前，能够隨便放下武器貿然停止戰爭嗎？市民諸君：須知「此時」戰爭狀態並未停止，「此地」仍然是日木軍的佔領區，如果不認淸現實，輕舉妄動，你能不吃眼前虧嗎？而且少數人吃虧事小，多數人遭殃事大，你能不加考慮嗎？</p>
<p>上海是一個五方雜處，謠言最多的都市，我希望每一個市民，不要因爲個人不謹愼的行爲，增加時局的嚴重性，尤其希望上海各界的領袖人士，挺起胸膛，負此責任，竭盡心力，來維持上海地區的安寗秩序。</p>
<h3 id="c10">從南京回來 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>最近爲了米糧問題，我於本月九日搭乘早車赴京，在車廂中可以看到沿途田野葱蘢，農民正忙於耕植，汗流浹背，操作不息，我逢站輒下車探詢，知本年稻作頗有豐收之望。</p>
<p>十日下午晋謁陳代主席，公務鞅掌，而精神奕奕，他對於本市民生極爲關心，頻頻垂詢。</p>
<p>關於時局變化，在南京毫無刺激，與平時一樣。</p>
<p>十日夜車離京，今日（十一日）上午十時返滬，途中一切如常。可是，到了上海，使我最先感觸的，第一是沒有常識的謠言孔冬，第二是少數人的浮燥行動。因此，在當日午間市民福利會理事會席上，一般老前輩均爲之感喟。</p>
<p>凡是一個有敎育的國家，有訓練之國民，越是在非常局而時局緊張之際，越能鎭靜處之，越能忍心耐受，越能遵守秩序與紀律，越能接受政府的領導。凡是賢明的政府領袖，決不樂聞或嗾使人民輕聽謠言，浮燥行動。本市昨天所發生的浮動行為，或是受了外國流氓的影響，或是聽信謠言，輕舉妄動吧。</p>
<p>我認為目前國際時局動向，應由各國政府當局商討決定的，旣不必揣測，也不必駭怪，而我們的任務，是在維護本市治安與安定民生兩點。就治安而言，木市四五年來，此較事變前良好，不能不感謝友邦軍警人員的努力。尤其是保甲人員的動員服務，裨助治安。因此，在治安方面，如能共同維護，可無問題。其次，安定民生方面，同樣重要，希望工商界領袖放遠目光，促使同業照常交易，切勿奇貨可居</p>
<p>最後，我認爲四五年來，在和平區內，中日兩國政府與政府之問，同志與同志之間，已經確立良好友誼，而今後在任何時局變動之下，只有進步，可以斷言。而對於今天少數市民的輕舉妄動，非常抱歉，希望立刻糾正。而對於日本僑民的沉靜忍耐，表示欽佩，希望持之以恒。</p>

<h3 id="c11">朱家角與章堰——靑浦縣的兩市鎭—— <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 秬嘉·錫華</p>
<p>朱家角舊名珠溪，俗名角里，是離上海百里左右，難築在澱山湖東遭江河畔一個市集，為靑浦縣內的首鎭。近來因滬地疏散人口而移居來此的很多，因此市容繁盛，現將近况略略介紹於後：</p>
<p>水上的交通路綫</p>
<p>該鎭處於水鄕，船是交通的唯一工具，主要的路綫是到上海，其乘法有二：一是有內河輪船公司的輪船，每隔日來往朱滬間。一是乘汽船到淸浦，再乘汽車由靑滬公路至上海。（全段路程可在三小時內到達，最慢五小時左右。）其次是到崑山，蘇州，松江等地，本來亦有汽船來往，但近來汽油缺乏，所以都由航船來代替了。至於與其他各地往來的航船，每日也有二十多艘。</p>
<p>事變以來，該鎭米經砲火的洗禮，一切街道房屋等仍完好如前，所以商業保持常態。又因環境處於鄕村問，商業的範圍是農作物與日用品的交換，故各商舖的營業對象，也都是農民，現市內有榨油廠四，麵粉廠三，米行及輾米廠十餘家，紡紗廠一，及錢莊五，其他各業的商店觸目皆是，其商業的興盛，亦可想而知了。</p>
<p>該鎭電燈，是由當地的珠浦電燈廠所供給，發電時間爲自下午七時至十二時，其中常有電力不足或斷電等情形發生，而且電費的昻貴，足可人嚇人，譬如七月份的電費，每度已達八千元。</p>
<p>物產與民生一斑</p>
<p>朱家角鎭所屬之田皆爲水田，故米是農作物的大宗出產，其他如菜籽·小麥·大麥·大豆蠶豆等物也有相當的產量，但今年因肥料的價格太高，又加以去年當局收買米糧價格太低，一般農民都不能充分的去加肥，收獲當然是不見良好的，如還沒有貸金等的救濟辦法，農村的破產恐怕即在眼前。</p>
<p>現時値夏令，瓜類當地也有大量的出產，如西瓜，黃金瓜，黃瓜及各種瓜類都有，尤其是西瓜，其產量更大，近日每一價約在四萬左右。</p>
<p>又因地屬水鄉，對於水產的生產也豐富，像魚，蝦，　等的出產很多，每年運往上海各地的數量極可觀。</p>
<p>該鎭自事變後，向由警備隊及保衛團所駐，所以對於明火搶刧等事很少見，但四郊鄕村間以「遊擊隊」爲名的土匪，處處皆有，尤以今年春間更爲猖獗，鎭上商民及住民，被綁或敲詐的很多，自五月起經當局的嚴厲彈壓下，已全部絕跡。民風尙稱儉樸，更受數年來物價的暴漲，收入的減少，民間的生活程度，亦日見減低。</p>
<p>近來物價的漲風也盛，日前白米每石已七十多萬元，肉每斤一萬元，菜油每擔一百十萬元，稻柴每捆五百元，（每捆約四斤左右）。其他如肥皂·火柴·洋燭等物品，因都由滬地運來，故價格均比上海高二成許。</p>
<p>敎育與慈善事業</p>
<p>該鎭現有縣立小學四，私立小學一及商業中人所辦的義務小學一，學生數約在二千左右，但其中數學校，因敎薪太低，一般敎師不能專其所職而數衍了事，學生程度也漸低落。</p>
<p>此外中學也有二所，一是創辦已三年的私立濟靑中學，一為剛辦的約光中學，下學期學費初中五斗六斗不等，高中在八斗左右，其學費雖不大，但也甚可觀，使欲求學而無力者，望其門而不得入，只得棄學求商者，每年的人數亦甚夥。</p>
<p>慈善事業在事變前有同仁，接嬰等堂，都以很多的田地作爲基金，自事變後，因田租欠收及辦事者的忽略，現除同仁當尙收埋些無主的露棺外，其他都已停止工作。</p>
<p>該鎭物產豐富，交通便利，治安健全，且又近上海，實是上海有職業者家屬的疏散目的地，希望有此念而無適常之目的地者注意云。</p>
<p>章堰附屬於靑浦縣的一座小鎭，因地處偏僻，交通非常不便，祗有數艘脚划船駛往南翔·黃渡·松江·角里·靑浦，遠至蘇州等地，除此之外，祗有步行方可達到，故交通上實感困難至極。</p>
<p>農產低落物價高昇</p>
<p>本組爲產米之地，粟·麥亦極豐富。鎭東種洋山芋者頗多，每一市價初爲三萬元以內，現亦不到四萬元，大多由鄉民裝船運滬出賣。日來米價平穩，但因受海上米價風波浪濤的傾向，最高紀錄亦頂達七十餘萬元，目下總站在五十關以內。戰前每年有米·麥·棉等大量輸出，但今年遠非昔比，因受當局收買影響，故農作物已極少，鄕民大半有斷糧之虞。近日已大有居民以雜糧代米充飢，如把黎麥磨細煮粥，又以洋山芋充飢者亦頗不少。產米區竟有此種情况，則不產米之地，如何慘狀，可以想見。</p>
<p>物價除一切農作物土產品外，皆須依賴上海由單帮客人帶來，以日用品爲衆，其他一切雜貨大多由脚划船代帶者佔多數，所以一切物價，較滬地爲貴，有時還有斷貨之慌，故人民生活水準極高，負一極重，又什麼捐，什麼捐多得不可勝數。購買力亦非常薄弱，商業方面一落千丈，因此不論鎭上居民與鄕村農民，同有「呌苦連天」之感！</p>
<p>目下微米大部已吿結束，當局爲獎勵鄕民計，以全數繳淸百分之七十以上者，皆有日用品贈與，如香烟·火柴·肥皂·有極少數作肥料用的大豆餅等，但此項物品均屬次等貨，且甚少。</p>
<p>安居樂業猶未達到</p>
<p>該鎭鎭公所，及行人注目的大牆上高而大的寫着有圖的標語，「淸鄕完成，安居樂業」「掃除土匪」等。雖然離開寫這標語的時候已很久了，而且淸鄉早已完成，但安居樂業，掃除土匪，猶未達到成功之地。去年的今日，暴盜竟敢大舉搶刧該鎭，且拉了鄉民的船隻，把鎮上商店內的貨物全部掠刧，裝載遠去，有時還要把店主打得頭破血流，繼而有五六次之多，居民們只有大哭小啼，亦是無可奈何，祇由聽天由命。</p>
<p>茶肆林立烟賭盛行</p>
<p>鄕民以目不識丁者佔大數，因此敎育程度極差，全鎭祗有小學校一所，中學需至靑浦城內始有，故一般文化水準確實甚低。邇來因受海上疏散之故，回鄕之居民日增一日，筆者亦是其中之一，且以異鄕市民遷入該鎭者亦不在少數，因而房價瘋狂上漲，普通一幢市房每月房金須十萬元以外，多至三十萬元一月，平常約一個房間，也要借五六萬元一月，如此高昂房價，實令人咋舌。</p>
<p>該地茶肆舖之設立，雖不亞於雨後的春筍，每一舖內，自淸晨至晚，總是賭客滿堂，蓋以鄕民羣以茶肆爲賭博之塲所，在表混着者爲流氓，地痞及那些九流三敎的鄉曲，呼盧喝雉，甚至通宵達旦，實令人嘆息。</p>
<p>普通一般靑年，因知識低劣，又無一技之長，故生活大多依賴家庭。思想腐敗得很，終日徘徊於街道，或涉足於茶肆舖內，沉醉於賭博之中，有些專門尋花問柳，較文雅一些的，很用功地學那胡琴，笛，簫，琵琶之類，幾個會得拉拉唱唱的，很自得驕傲的樣子，充分表現他們的墮落性。（移酬助學）</p>

<p>諸位同志：現在時局已經有了新的開展，我們服務地方的保甲自警人員，亦到了責任最重大的階段。幾年以來，諸君流了許多的血汗不辭辛勞，爲地方治安人民福祉而努力，然而還沒有因此而得到全體市民的澈底瞭解，這固然由於環境的關係，但事實還是事實，母贅待言的。時至今日，雖然和平已有原則上之決定，終還在靑黃不接的時候，因此這個時期，便是我們服務地方維護治安的試金石。我們一定要更進一步的努力，不問時局如何的演進，祗求市民能得到眞正的安居樂業，國家能多保持一份元氣，便算了却我們的心願。我想這幾年來所下的苦心，日後一定會得到全市民的同情的，愛鄕土，愛國家，可說是每一個人的天性，但是我們對付任何事物，都應鎭靜沉着，切不可囂張浮燥，因爲眞正愛護地方的人決不做輕浮而妨害地方治安的事，以致影響整個市民的安寗，同時祇有盡心力能犧牲小我，努力維護社會元氣，才是眞正的愛國者</p>
<p>費去一分寳貴的力，一定有一分賽貴的效果，雖然我們素抱只事耕耘，不問收獲的宗旨，但至少是做到了心安理得，無愧於國家社會的地步。」</p>

<h3 id="c29">濟民醫院參觀記 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 家熙</p>
<p>北西藏路二四〇號濟民醫院，爲了適應目前情勢的需要，已迅速而有計劃的組織了一個空襲災民臨時救濟委員會，以蕢延芳·董和甫·朱鴻儀·樂汝成等十二人爲委員，廣泛的開展工作，他們已把成百的人從死亡中救活回來。</p>
<p>他們的確做到「空襲被災，免費治療」這八個字，該院接收空襲重傷者住院，醫藥膳食等費完全免收，這是非常難能可貴的，與一般唯利是圖的醫院，眞有天淵之別。</p>
<p>不同的慘痛畫面</p>
<p>承該院醫師梅晋良及韓華尹兩博士的引導，記者親眼目覩了受傷災民各種不同的慘痛的畫面，在門診室裘經常有着輕傷的災民川流不息的來醫治，老的少的男的女的，這些人在病單上都加註了「空襲受傷」的字樣，有這四個字的，掛號費·診金·藥費是完全免收的。他們的傷勢比較不大重，即使有的也曾開過刀，但都無須乎住院。他們每天或隔日來院醫治換藥·洗傷·打針，從沒有間　過。不僅這門診的一百多傷民是很快的可以恢復健康，就是三十四名住院的重傷者，也都安然的渡過了危險的時期，不久就可以陸續出院，回去從事他們原有的職業了。</p>
<p>受傷的人多來自浦東，滬東北及滬北區，以農民·小販·船夫·拉車·苦力爲多，幾乎都是赤貧者，全是些自食其力的人。在三樓的光亮的病室　，每一間都躺着三五個病人，一個個穿着艦褸的短衣，有的整槐的白紗布綳在紫醫色或愴白色的脚上，小腿·大腿·胸部·頭部·手上·臂部·膀上。有的一隻手已被鋸去，有的臂膀用白紗布綑紮着，用木板支撑着，有的正睡着，有的坐在床上，有的斜躺着，有的在呻吟，有的在睜大着眼張望着，這裏包括着不同年齡的男女。</p>
<p>一走進去，梅晋良醫師就被病人病人家屬及護士不斷地呼喚着：「請替他換換藥好吧」！「我痛啊」！請通一通便成嗎」？梅醫師安慰着他們，答應着他們，並關照護士如何爲他們料理。一個呌做高阿常四十多的中年人是壓傷的，梅醫師讓我用手摸一摸他的胸口，呌我猜猜裘面有什末東西，是一粒粒東西在皮膚裏蠕動。「這大概是　吧」？我說。梅醫師笑了：「不是，這是空氣，在房屋壓下來後，他的肺破了，空氣就擠到肌肉和皮膚下，在胸口在背部都有，這要慢慢地壓縮出來，現在還不能脫除危險期」。一個婦人臀部中了一彈從後面打進側面打出，穿了一個肉洞，當梅醫師將綳帶·紗布·棉花一層層取下的時候，一個血肉混合着的洞口呈現在眼前，蒼白的皮膚已經在收着口了，一切已無大妨礙了。但疼痛却是不免的，醫師在這時就常常爲他打止痛針，以減輕他的痛苦。</p>
<p>一個徼　的小生命</p>
<p>一個十一歲的小孩壽根生在醫院內很活潑地跑來跑去，和梅醫師護士們都很熟識，據極醫師說他也是空襲受傷的一個，並且情形最最嚴重，當剛進院時大家都認爲他的生命是最無法挽救的，原來他被一顆子彈頭子打中了肺部，但由於他自身的抵抗力强，子彈在肺部已被包圍住了，不致有危險，創口也在收歛了。這孩子假如要動手術取彈的話也許就很少希望了。還有一個人耳朶已經掉下了四分之三，大家都以勢必完全落下，但如奇蹟似的竟又長好了，人的身體是多末不可思義呵。又有一個十五六歲的孩子，全家父母兄弟都死了，他自已也受重傷，一切東一四完全失去，孤零零的出院後生活眞不堪想呢！</p>
<p>梅醫師關照那壽根生到三樓照照X光，使記者明瞭他的病狀，這孩子吿訴了他母親一聲後，就跳跳蹦蹦的搶在前面跑去了，他還是一個獨生子呢，現在已從死亡中逃出來，眞是最最幸運的人。梅醫師很愛護他，竟如慈父關懷他的兒子一樣，護士們看見了他也都向他微笑。透過了X光，黑暗的室內，記者淸楚的看見了一個錐形的黑色子彈頭停留在他的肋骨之間。翻過身再照一照，看起來更加分明了。這時又有一個五十歲的男子在病床上推了進來，這人呌雷炳賢，是一個拉車爲生的，五十多歲。記者剛才在他的房間也看過一遍，他曾開過一次刀，是在小腿肚上，曾取出一塊彈片，梅醫師呌這人把彈片取我看看。這人從枕頭下挖出了一僩皮夾，愼重地從里面倒出了一小塊三分長一分寬的鉛質黑色的東西，這東西在他是很有意義的，給我們看渦了之後，他又如珍寳似的收賤起來。現在是來照他脚心中的彈片的所在都位，預備動手術的。在X光燈下瞧見有一塊黑色的東西橫在脚趾之間，這就是急須取出的，否則嚴重化起來，很可能影響到整個的健康。所以這人就馬上預備推到手備室去動手術。韓醫師說如果沒有X光設備，是一切都無從着手的。</p>
<p>手術台上觸目驚心</p>
<p>這是一間寬大光亮的房子，一張手術台上　着待施手術的人。兩張被璃櫉里放着許多各種各樣醫療器械剪刀，拑子，針等。梅晋良和韓莘尹兩醫師，穿了白色手術衣，戴着白帽紮着口罩走了進來，幾個護士已將傷者安置好了，脚部被包好，只留着待開刀的一塊傷口露出外面。爲了免除傷者的痛苦，韓醫師在這車夫的脊柱間注射了一針奴佛卡因（Novcain　5％3cc），當藥水打進之後，就從針管滴下一滴滴的水，據說那就是脊隨液。打過這麻醉針的人，必須使頭部及上體略略向下傾斜的，這由於奴佛卡因的比重較脊髓液的比重為輕，如果不使人體略略向下倒轉，那末藥液就必昇到　神精，那就要有生命的危險了。當藥性貫穿下體之後，韓醫師在他脚心使勁地用箝子揑了幾下，這人痛得呌起來，再過一會也就安靜了，大概脚部已漸漸失去知覺。首先一根長鐵釬揰入傷口，試探出彈片所在的部位，血滴了下來，　入下面的鉛桶裏，包着的布也染紅了。爲了便於箝出彈片，傷口四周的皮肉又被剪了幾處裂口，這樣韓醫師戴着手套的手指又伸入脚心，摸着了彈片正確的所在，常雪亮的鐵箝深入傷口的肉洞後，很快的就帶出一個東西扔在永門汀上，沈重的一響，這是尙帶有肌肉血塊的鉛片。這時傷者口中吐出了一片混有赤豆和粥粒的液體，他並且還得不到好的營養呢！又在肉洞裏摸索了一會，又取出了一塊白的硬片鮮紅的血還在上面，「這就是碎骨片」，韓醫師這樣的吿訴記者。四五把剪刀挿在傷口洞中，推過來一架電氣止血機，電綫通在剪刀發出一星星的火花，血不再從那洞裏流出。用藥棉花塞好後一切手續也就完了，人被脚高頭低地抬了出去，手術台空了下來，再等另外的一個人來。</p>
<p>救活人命不惜工本</p>
<p>人命在這里是極被珍視的，這裏的醫師眞把一個人看作一個人，並不囚爲貧窮而輕視，剛才對那拉車注射的脊柱麻醉用的奴佛卡因，據說就値十萬元一針，同時這人也又注射過作為止痛用的嗎啡針，作為安神劑的安眼藥。還有葡萄糖鈣，維他命B，維他命C，破傷風抗毒素，消治龍，來等的葉都曾用過，再加上紗布，棉花，橡皮膏及飮食費，在這人身上就足足有三百多萬，有的許多藥還不止一次地，竟每日或者隔日注射，有許多葉如果馬虎點的話，是可以省掉而不用的，但如眞那樣，傷者的精力更是大大消耗，抗抵力將更加滅少，可能造成較多的危險。為了澈底的救活一個人，他們不惜工本地使用他們院中僅有的一些藥品。一個傷勢深重的人就是傷勢較輕的人，破傷風抗毒素也才如此。他們是這樣重視自已的工作和傷民的生命，毫不吝嗇地使用貴重的藥品，而把這些人從死亡中拯救轉來。這醫院爲社會服務的方針，以及仁慈的醫師以最大的關懷和注意，來照料每一個貧苦的傷者的行爲，都是</p>
<p>顯然濟民醫院是値得我們給以助力的，上面曾說過的各種藥品，以及米糧，現金，被彬，草蓆，都是他們迫切需要的，深望各方大量捐輪，同時記者也願以最大的信任，來介紹這免費而不忽視人命的醫院。</p>

<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) – According to an announcement by the Western Military District Headquarters at 14:45 on the 9th, at around 11:00 AM on the 9th, a large American aircraft intruded into Nagasaki City and dropped bombs resembling a new type on the ground.

<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) – At around 00:00 on the night of the 9th, Japanese air units discovered a mobile task force, centered around four aircraft carriers, approximately one hundred and several dozen nautical miles east of Mt.

It is reported that several other kamikaze aircraft carried out intrusions, apparently causing considerable damage. Although this mobile task force temporarily retreated afterward, it has now re-entered Japanese waters, and its total strength appears to be roughly the same as that of July 10th.</p>
<p>Osaka, 11th (Central News Agency) – From the evening of the 10th to the morning of the 11th, approximately thirty B-29s, either individually or in small groups, were active around Shimonoseki and Hagi, near the islands of Shimane Prefecture, and off the coast of Korea, primarily for the purpose of dropping sea mines.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Japanese Government Lodges Strong Protest with the United States via Switzerland, Demanding Cessation of New Type Bombs to Uphold Humanity <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) – On the 10th, the Japanese government lodged a protest via the Swiss government regarding the B-29 attack on Hiroshima on the 6th with a new type of bomb. At the same time, it instructed Minister Kase in Switzerland to explain the main points of this Japanese protest to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The gist of the statement is as follows: On the 6th of this month, American aircraft dropped a new type of bomb on the urban area of Hiroshima City, instantly injuring and killing a large number of citizens. At the same time, it completely destroyed most of the city. Hiroshima City is the same as ordinary cities and does not have special military defenses or facilities, and there is absolutely no possibility of constituting a military target. Although U.S. President Truman has stated regarding this bombing that "we should destroy shipbuilding factories and transportation facilities," the bombs dropped this time were attached with parachutes and exploded in the air, with a relatively large range of destructive power. It is absolutely impossible to limit its power to a small area. This is very clear, and the United States has long been familiar with the performance of these bombs. Furthermore, the actual damage situation is that all Japanese people residing in the affected area, regardless of combatants or non-combatants, and regardless of men, women, old, or young, were all innocently massacred. Not only is the scope of the damage extremely wide, but the tragic condition of the damage is also unbearable to witness. The fundamental principle of wartime international law stipulates that one of the belligerent countries is not without restrictions regarding the means of restraining the enemy, and it is explicitly prohibited to use weapons or projectiles and other weapons that cause unnecessary suffering to the enemy. Since the outbreak of this World War, the U.S. government has repeatedly stated that the use of poison gas and the adoption of other inhumane methods of warfare are considered illegal acts by civilized society. The widespread destructive power and the cruel nature of the new type of bombs it has used far exceed the previously prohibited poison gas and other various weapons. Disregarding international laws and the fundamental principles of humanity, the U.S. has blindly bombed Japanese cities on a large scale, killing and injuring many elderly, women, and children, and bombing and destroying numerous shrines, temples, schools, hospitals, and ordinary civilian houses. The use of this new type of indiscriminate and cruel bomb is a new addition of a criminal record to the history of human culture. The Japanese government hereby, in the name of the Japanese government and in the name of all mankind and civilization, strongly protests and demands that the U.S. government rectify its illegal actions, reflect on its actions, and immediately cease using this inhumane new type of bomb.</p>

<h3 id="e9">A Message to the Citizens of Shanghai <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Junqiang</p>
<p>Since the evening of the 10th of this month, when various broadcasts reported the news of Japan's peace overtures, the citizens of Shanghai, who have suffered from eight or nine years of war, cannot help but be pleasantly surprised, which is only human nature and not surprising. However, as far as I know, on the 11th, some people's emotions were overly impulsive and they engaged in some excessive and immature actions. I am afraid that a few hooligans and thugs may also take advantage of the public's agitated emotions, deliberately causing trouble in the hope of muddling the waters and looting while the fire is burning.</p>
<p>Many enlightened people in this city believe that these phenomena should not exist and must be corrected. The Municipal Government, together with the Security Headquarters, mobilized all police, neighborhood association personnel, and self-defense groups, as well as security inspector brigades and special security corps, to strictly maintain order in different areas. They will correct any phenomena that should not exist in the city at any time and place. Even if some short-sighted citizens misunderstand or criticize us, we can only carry out our wooden duties with tears in our eyes.</p>
<p>At 18:30 on the afternoon of the 11th, I, representing Mayor Zhou, met with Commander Matsui of the Japanese army. He told me that as of the time of the conversation, he had only heard some broadcast news and had not received any instructions regarding peace from the Tokyo government or the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army. Let us think calmly: Can a million-strong army, on a long expedition abroad, rashly lay down its arms and stop the war without receiving correct orders from the highest commander in its home country? Citizens, you must know that "at this time" the state of war has not ceased, and "this place" is still an occupied area of the Japanese army. If you do not recognize reality and act rashly, can you avoid suffering an immediate loss? Moreover, the loss of a few people is a small matter, but the suffering of the majority is a serious matter. Can you not consider this?</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city with people from all directions and many rumors. I hope that every citizen will not increase the severity of the situation due to their own imprudent behavior. In particular, I hope that leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai will stand tall, take responsibility, and do their best to maintain peace and order in the Shanghai area.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Returning from Nanjing <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Recently, for the sake of the rice and grain issue, I took the early train to Nanjing on the 9th of this month. In the train carriage, I could see the fields along the way luxuriant and green, and the farmers were busy cultivating, sweating profusely and working tirelessly. I got off the train at every stop to inquire and learned that there is a good hope for a bumper rice harvest this year.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 10th, I visited Acting Chairman Chen, who was busy with official duties but full of energy. He was very concerned about the people's livelihood in this city and frequently inquired.</p>
<p>Regarding the changes in the current situation, there was no excitement in Nanjing, and it was the same as usual.</p>
<p>I left Nanjing by the night train on the 10th and returned to Shanghai at 10:00 AM today (the 11th). Everything was normal along the way. However, when I arrived in Shanghai, the first thing that touched me the most was the prevalence of senseless rumors, and the second was the agitated actions of a few people. Therefore, at the meeting of the board of directors of the Citizens Welfare Association at noon that day, the senior members all sighed with emotion.</p>
<p>The more a country is educated and its citizens are trained, the more calm it can be in a very unusual and tense situation, the more it can endure patiently, the more it can abide by order and discipline, and the more it can accept the leadership of the government. All wise government leaders will never be happy to hear or instigate people to lightly listen to rumors and act agitatedly. The agitated behavior that occurred in this city yesterday may have been influenced by foreign hooligans, or it may have been due to listening to rumors and acting rashly.</p>
<p>I believe that the current international situation and trends should be discussed and decided by the government authorities of various countries. There is no need to speculate or be alarmed. Our task is to maintain the two aspects of public security in this city and stabilize people's livelihood. In terms of public security, this city has been better in the past four or five years than before the incident, and we cannot but thank the efforts of the allied military police personnel. In particular, the mobilization and service of the neighborhood association personnel has been helpful to public security. Therefore, in terms of public security, if we can jointly maintain it, there should be no problems. Secondly, stabilizing people's livelihood is equally important. I hope that leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors will take a long-term view, promote business as usual, and avoid hoarding goods.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that in the past four or five years, a good friendship has been established between the Chinese and Japanese governments and between comrades in the peace zone, and it can be asserted that there will only be progress under any changes in the situation in the future. I am very sorry for the rash actions of a few citizens today and hope that they will be corrected immediately. I express my admiration for the calmness and patience of the Japanese residents and hope that they will continue to do so.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Zhujiajiao and Zhangyan – Two Towns in Qingpu County – <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Ju Jia · Xihua</p>
<p>Zhujiajiao, formerly known as Zhuxi and colloquially known as Jiaoli, is a market town located about a hundred li from Shanghai, built on the eastern side of Dianshan Lake by rivers. In recent years, many people have moved here from Shanghai due to the dispersal of the population, so the townscape is thriving. I will now briefly introduce its current situation:</p>
<p>Water Transportation Routes</p>
<p>The town is located in a water town, and boats are the only means of transportation. The main route is to Shanghai, and there are two ways to travel: one is by the inland river steamer company's ships, which travel between Zhujiajiao and Shanghai every other day. The other is to take a steamer to Qingpu and then take a car on the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway to Shanghai. (The entire journey can be completed in three hours, at the slowest about five hours.) Secondly, there are routes to Kunshan, Suzhou, Songjiang, and other places. Originally, there were also steamers traveling to these places, but recently, due to the lack of gasoline, they have all been replaced by sailing ships. As for sailing ships traveling to other places, there are also more than twenty ships every day.</p>
<p>Since the incident, the town has not been washed by gunfire, and all the streets, houses, etc. are still as good as before, so business remains normal. Also, because the environment is in the countryside, the scope of business is the exchange of agricultural products and daily necessities, so the business objects of the various shops are also farmers. Currently, there are four oil mills, three flour mills, more than ten rice shops and rice milling plants, one spinning mill, and five money shops in the city. The other shops in various industries are visible everywhere, and the prosperity of its commerce can also be imagined.</p>
<p>Electricity in the town is supplied by the local Zhupu Electric Light Plant. The power supply time is from 7:00 PM to 12:00 AM. There are often cases of insufficient power or power outages, and the high cost of electricity is enough to scare people. For example, the electricity bill for July has reached 8,000 yuan per kilowatt-hour.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Products and People's Livelihood</p>
<p>The fields belonging to Zhujiajiao Town are all paddy fields, so rice is the main agricultural product. Other products such as rapeseed, wheat, barley, soybeans, and broad beans also have considerable yields. However, this year, due to the high price of fertilizers and the low price at which the authorities purchased rice last year, most farmers cannot fully fertilize, and the harvest is certainly not good. If there are no relief measures such as loans, the bankruptcy of the countryside is probably imminent.</p>
<p>Now is the summer season, and there are also a large number of melons and fruits produced locally, such as watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and various other melons. Especially watermelons, the output is even greater. Recently, the price of each watermelon is about 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, because the area is a water town, the production of aquatic products is also abundant, such as fish, shrimp, and so on. The quantity transported to various parts of Shanghai every year is considerable.</p>
<p>Since the incident, the town has been garrisoned by the police and the security regiment, so incidents of open robbery are rarely seen. However, bandits in the countryside on all sides, under the name of "guerrillas," are everywhere, especially rampant this spring. Many merchants and residents in the town have been kidnapped or extorted. Since May, after the authorities' strict suppression, they have all disappeared. The folk customs are still considered thrifty. Due to the soaring prices and reduced income in recent years, the standard of living of the people has also been declining day by day.</p>
<p>Recently, the trend of rising prices is also strong. A stone of white rice has recently reached more than 700,000 yuan, meat is 10,000 yuan per catty, vegetable oil is 1.1 million yuan per dan, and rice straw is 500 yuan per bundle (each bundle is about four catties). Other items such as soap, matches, and candles are all transported from Shanghai, so the prices are about 20% higher than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Education and Charity</p>
<p>The town currently has four county-run primary schools, one private primary school, and one compulsory primary school run by people in business, with about 2,000 students. However, in some of these schools, due to the low salaries of the teachers, most teachers cannot devote themselves to their duties and simply go through the motions, and the students' level is also gradually declining.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also two middle schools, one is the private Jiqing Middle School, which has been established for three years, and the other is the Yueguang Middle School, which has just been established. Tuition for the next semester is between five and six dou for junior high school and around eight dou for senior high school. Although the tuition is not large, it is still considerable, making those who want to study but cannot afford it unable to enter, and the number of people who have to give up school and seek business every year is also very large.</p>
<p>Before the incident, charity work included the Tongren and Jieying halls, which used a lot of land as a foundation. Since the incident, due to unpaid land rent and the neglect of the people in charge, now only the Tongren Hall still buries some ownerless coffins, and all other work has stopped.</p>
<p>The town is rich in products, convenient in transportation, sound in public security, and close to Shanghai. It is indeed a relocation destination for the families of employed people in Shanghai. I hope that those who have this idea but do not have a suitable destination will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Zhangyan is a small town affiliated with Qingpu County. Due to its remote location, transportation is very inconvenient. There are only a few rowing boats traveling to Nanxiang, Huangdu, Songjiang, Jiaoli, Qingpu, and as far as Suzhou and other places. Apart from that, it can only be reached on foot, so transportation is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Low Agricultural Production and High Prices</p>
<p>This group is a rice-producing area, and millet and wheat are also very abundant. Many people in the east of the town grow sweet potatoes, and the price per market is initially within 30,000 yuan, but now it is also less than 40,000 yuan. Most of them are transported by villagers by boat to Shanghai for sale. Recently, rice prices have been stable, but due to the tendency of sea rice price fluctuations, the highest record has also reached more than 700,000 yuan, and currently it is generally below 500,000. Before the war, a large amount of rice, wheat, cotton, etc. were exported every year, but this year is far from the past. Due to the impact of the authorities' purchases, there are very few crops, and most villagers are in danger of running out of food. Recently, many residents have been replacing rice with miscellaneous grains, such as grinding quinoa into porridge, and quite a few people are also using sweet potatoes to fill their stomachs. Such a situation in a rice-producing area is unimaginable in areas that do not produce rice.</p>
<p>In addition to all agricultural and local products, the prices of everything else must rely on Shanghai and be brought in by single-transport merchants, with daily necessities being the most popular. Most of the other groceries are brought by rowing boats, so all prices are more expensive than in Shanghai, and sometimes there is even a shortage of goods. Therefore, people's living standards are extremely high, and they bear a very heavy burden. There are also countless taxes and donations. Purchasing power is also very weak, and business is plummeting. Therefore, both the residents of the town and the farmers in the countryside have a feeling of "crying out in pain!"</p>
<p>The micro-rice collection is now mostly over. In order to reward the villagers, the authorities are giving daily necessities to those who pay more than 70% of the total amount, such as cigarettes, matches, soap, and a very small amount of soybean cakes for fertilizer. However, these items are all second-class goods and are very few.</p>
<p>Peace and Prosperity Have Yet to Be Achieved</p>
<p>The town hall in the town and the large slogans written high and large on the eye-catching walls say, "Complete the clearing of the countryside, live and work in peace and prosperity" and "Eliminate bandits." Although it has been a long time since these slogans were written, and the clearing of the countryside has long been completed, peace and prosperity and the elimination of bandits have yet to be achieved. On this day last year, bandits dared to rob the town in a large scale, and even pulled away the villagers' boats and looted all the goods in the town's shops and loaded them away. Sometimes they even beat the shopkeepers until their heads were bleeding. This happened five or six times, and the residents could only cry and wail, but there was nothing they could do, and they had to resign themselves to fate.</p>
<p>Teahouses Are Everywhere and Gambling Is Rampant</p>
<p>Most of the villagers are illiterate, so the level of education is extremely poor. There is only one primary school in the whole town, and middle school is only available in Qingpu city, so the general cultural level is indeed very low. Recently, due to the evacuation from the sea, the number of residents returning to their hometowns is increasing day by day. The writer is also one of them, and the number of citizens from other places moving into the town is also not small. Therefore, house prices have risen madly. The monthly rent for an ordinary city house must be more than 100,000 yuan, and as much as 300,000 yuan a month. Usually, a room costs about 50,000 or 60,000 yuan a month. Such high rents are truly staggering.</p>
<p>The establishment of teahouses in the area is no less than after a spring rain. In every shop, from morning to night, there are always gamblers filling the hall. Most of the villagers use teahouses as gambling places. Those who are mixed up are hooligans, thugs, and those from the lowest classes. They are calling and drinking all night long, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Most ordinary young people depend on their families for a living because of their poor knowledge and lack of skills. They are very corrupt in their thinking, wandering the streets all day long or frequenting teahouses, indulging in gambling. Some specialize in seeking pleasure, while others, who are more refined, are very diligent in learning the erhu, flute, xiao, pipa, and other instruments. A few who can play and sing are very proud of themselves, fully demonstrating their depravity. (Relocate Rewards Scholarship)</p>

Yesterday, the China Central Revival Company and its affiliated companies donated 10 million yuan in cash and 30 million yuan worth of medicines and equipment to the municipal government to be used for disaster relief. Mr. Banno Kiyoshi, Vice President of the company, personally delivered the above cash and medicines to the municipal government authorities yesterday, and Deputy Secretary-General Hu personally received them and expressed his gratitude.

<p>The Bureau of Education has been paying the new estimated salaries for July to the faculty and staff of municipal schools, museums, and libraries since yesterday (the 10th). It is now known that Director Jie is scheduled to hand over the office at 10:00 AM on the 14th of this month. In order to expedite the conclusion, it was resolved that all affiliated units would work as usual on Sunday (the 12th), and all schools, museums, and libraries can still go to claim their salaries. In case schools in rural areas cannot arrive in time, it is planned to dispatch personnel to the bureau to handle the matter after the handover. As for the 3 dou of salary rice per person for the second half of June and the first half of July for faculty and staff, it is reported that an agreement has also been reached with Director Liu of the Bureau of Economic Affairs. Once the roster is approved by the municipal government, it can be issued, which will not take long. However, as Director Jie is about to hand over the office, all the above salary rice and special fees for office work in July will be left to the new director to handle.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Baojia Personnel Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday - Decided to Cooperate to Maintain Local Order <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau believes that at this critical time, the Baojia Self-Defense Corps should make every effort to assist the authorities in maintaining local public security. Yesterday (the 11th) at 4:00 PM, it specially convened more than 600 people, including the heads and deputy heads of the 18 Baojia districts and all committee members of the district branches, at the Huangjin Grand Theater for an emergency meeting. Director Gu of the Baojia Office gave a speech, saying that Baojia personnel should have the ambition to be self-vigilant and self-defense, come forward to take on the task of maintaining local order and preserving the vitality of society. Then, Baojia personnel from each district proposed five points for discussion, which were unanimously approved by each district. After returning to their districts, they immediately convened all levels of Baojia self-defense personnel to convey the implementation.</p>
<p>Five Points Passed</p>
<p>Five points passed: 1. Many rice, firewood, and oil shops are not open, and prices are soaring, making it impossible or impossible for ordinary people to buy them. It was decided that each district should use each Bao as a unit to borrow from residents with surplus grain and concentrate it at the Baoan Office, and then distribute it to the poor citizens in the Bao separately, to be returned in the future. 2. Starting today, in addition to the original self-defense posts, each district will add self-defense corps members to patrol day and night. 3. All shops should be persuaded to open, and shop assistants should be persuaded to stay in the shop. 4. When serving, the self-defense corps should cooperate closely with the police and other security forces such as the Security Special Task Force. 5. Citizens should be earnestly advised not to be emotionally impulsive, and must work together with one heart and one mind for the sake of the local community.</p>
<p>Director Gu's Speech</p>
<p>Dear comrades: The current situation has taken on new developments, and we Baojia self-defense personnel who serve the local area have reached the stage of the most important responsibility. For several years, you have shed much blood and sweat, tirelessly working for local public security and the well-being of the people. However, you have not yet gained a thorough understanding of all citizens because of the environment, but the facts are still the facts, and there is no need to dwell on them. Today, although peace has been decided in principle, it is still a time of transition. Therefore, this period is the touchstone for our service to the local area and maintenance of public security. We must work even harder, regardless of how the situation evolves, and only ask that the citizens can get true peace and prosperity, and the country can maintain a vitality, and we will be relieved. I think the hard work we have put in these years will definitely get the sympathy of all the citizens in the future. Loving the homeland and loving the country can be said to be the nature of everyone, but we should deal with anything calmly and calmly, and never be arrogant and impetuous, because those who truly love the local area will never do frivolous things that hinder local public security, which will affect the peace of the entire city. At the same time, only by devoting our heart and soul to sacrificing the small self and striving to maintain the vitality of society can we be true patriots.</p>
<p>If a bit of precious effort is spent, there must be a bit of valuable effect. Although we have always held the principle of only plowing and not asking about the harvest, at least we have achieved peace of mind and are worthy of the country and society."</p>

<h3 id="e36">A Visit to Jimin Hospital <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Xi</p>
<p>Jimin Hospital at 240 North Xizang Road, in order to meet the needs of the current situation, has quickly and systematically organized a temporary relief committee for air raid victims, with Kui Yan-fang, Dong He-fu, Zhu Hong-yi, Le Ru-cheng, and twelve others as members, to broadly carry out the work. They have rescued hundreds of people from death.</p>
<p>They have indeed fulfilled the eight characters: "Free treatment for air raid victims." The hospital admits air raid victims with severe injuries for hospitalization, and all medical, pharmaceutical, and dietary expenses are completely waived. This is extremely commendable and truly a world apart from ordinary profit-seeking hospitals.</p>
<p>Different Painful Scenes</p>
<p>Guided by Dr. Mei Jin-liang and Dr. Han Hua-yin of the hospital, the reporter personally witnessed various painful scenes of injured victims. In the outpatient room, there is often a constant stream of victims with minor injuries coming for treatment, old and young, male and female. All of their medical records have the words "injured in air raid" added. Those with these four words are completely exempt from registration fees, consultation fees, and medication fees. Their injuries are relatively minor, and even if some have had surgery, they do not need to be hospitalized. They come to the hospital every day or every other day for treatment, dressing changes, wound cleaning, and injections, without interruption. Not only can these more than one hundred injured outpatients quickly recover their health, but also the thirty-four hospitalized severely injured patients have safely passed through the dangerous period and will soon be discharged from the hospital one after another to return to their original occupations.</p>
<p>Most of the injured come from Pudong, Northeast Shanghai, and North Shanghai, mostly farmers, vendors, boatmen, rickshaw pullers, and coolies. Almost all are impoverished and self-reliant people. In the bright wards on the third floor, each room has three to five patients lying down, each wearing short jackets of various colors. Some have whole pieces of white gauze bandages wrapped around their purplish-red or pale feet, calves, thighs, chests, heads, hands, arms, and shoulders. Some have had one hand amputated, others have their arms wrapped in white gauze, supported by wooden boards. Some are sleeping, some are sitting on the bed, some are lying diagonally, some are groaning, and some are staring wide-eyed. It includes men and women of different ages.</p>
<p>As soon as we walked in, Dr. Mei Jin-liang was constantly being called by patients, family members, and nurses: "Please change his dressing!" "I'm in pain!" "Can you help me have a bowel movement?" Dr. Mei comforted them, promised them, and instructed the nurses how to care for them. A middle-aged man named Gao A-chang in his forties was crushed by debris. Dr. Mei asked me to feel his chest and guess what was underneath the skin. There were small things moving under the skin. "Is it worms?" I asked. Dr. Mei smiled, "No, it's air. After the house collapsed, his lungs ruptured, and the air squeezed into the muscles and under the skin. It's on his chest and back. It needs to be slowly compressed out. He's not out of danger yet." A woman had a bullet enter her hip from the back and exit from the side, creating a fleshy hole. When Dr. Mei removed the bandages, gauze, and cotton layer by layer, a hole of mixed blood and flesh appeared before my eyes. The pale skin had already begun to heal, and everything was no longer a major problem. But pain was inevitable, so the doctor often gave her pain-relieving injections to reduce her suffering.</p>
<p>A Small, Fortunate Life</p>
<p>An eleven-year-old child, Shou Gen-sheng, runs around the hospital very lively and is familiar with Dr. Mei and the nurses. According to Dr. Ji, he was also injured in an air raid, and his condition was the most serious. When he first came to the hospital, everyone thought his life was beyond saving. It turned out that he had been hit in the lung by a bullet fragment, but because of his strong resistance, the bullet was encapsulated in his lung, posing no danger, and the wound was also healing. If this child had surgery to remove the bullet, there would be little hope. There was also a person whose ear had three-quarters fallen off, and everyone thought it would definitely fall off completely, but miraculously it grew back. The human body is so incredible. There was also a fifteen or sixteen-year-old child whose entire family, parents and siblings, had died, and he himself was severely injured. Everything was completely lost. It is unimaginable how difficult life will be after he is discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p>Dr. Mei instructed Shou Gen-sheng to go to the third floor for an X-ray so that the reporter could understand his condition. The child told his mother and then jumped and ran ahead. He is also an only child. Now that he has escaped from death, he is the luckiest person. Dr. Mei loves him as a kind father cares for his son, and the nurses smile at him when they see him. Through the X-ray, in the dark room, the reporter clearly saw a cone-shaped black bullet fragment lodged between his ribs. Turning him over and taking another picture, it looked even clearer. At this time, a fifty-year-old man was wheeled in on a hospital bed. This man, named Lei Bing-xian, is a rickshaw puller in his fifties. The reporter had seen him in his room earlier. He had had surgery on his calf, where a piece of shrapnel was removed. Dr. Mei asked him to show me the shrapnel. This man dug out a small leather wallet from under his pillow, carefully poured out a small piece of lead-like black material, about three fen long and one fen wide. This thing was very meaningful to him. After showing it to us, he treasured it back. Now he came to have an X-ray of his foot to determine the location of the shrapnel, in preparation for surgery. Under the X-ray light, a black object was seen lying between his toes. This must be removed urgently; otherwise, if it becomes serious, it may affect his overall health. So this man was immediately prepared to be wheeled to the operating room for surgery. Dr. Han said that without X-ray equipment, nothing could be done.</p>
<p>A Horrifying Scene on the Operating Table</p>
<p>This is a large, bright room. A surgical table lies waiting for surgery. Two glass cabinets hold many kinds of medical instruments, scissors, pliers, needles, and so on. Dr. Mei Jin-liang and Dr. Han Hua-yin, wearing white surgical gowns, white hats, and masks, walked in. Several nurses had already arranged the injured person, whose feet were wrapped up, leaving only the wound to be cut open exposed. To avoid the pain of the injured, Dr. Han injected Novcain (5% 3cc) into the rickshaw puller's spine. After the liquid was injected, drops of water dripped from the needle tube. It is said that that is spinal fluid. People who have had this anesthetic injection must have their head and upper body slightly tilted downward, because Novcain is lighter than spinal fluid. If the body is not slightly inverted, the liquid will rise to the brain, which could endanger life. After the drug permeated the lower body, Dr. Han forcefully pinched his foot several times with pliers. The man screamed in pain, and then calmed down, probably because his foot had gradually lost sensation. First, a long iron rod was inserted into the wound to probe the location of the shrapnel. Blood dripped down and into the lead bucket below, and the wrapping cloth was also stained red. To facilitate clamping out the shrapnel, several cuts were made in the skin around the wound. Then Dr. Han, wearing gloves, reached his finger into the wound of the foot, feeling the exact location of the shrapnel. A bright iron clamp was inserted deep into the fleshy wound and quickly brought out an object and threw it onto the cement floor, with a heavy thud. This was a piece of lead still attached with muscle and blood clots. At this time, the injured person spat out a liquid mixed with adzuki beans and rice porridge. He wasn't getting good nutrition either! He also groped in the fleshy hole for a while, and took out a white hard piece with fresh red blood on it. "This is a piece of broken bone," Dr. Han told the reporter. Four or five pairs of scissors were inserted into the wound hole. An electric hemostat was pushed over. The wire was connected to the scissors, emitting a spark, and the blood no longer flowed from the hole. After packing the wound with medicated cotton, all the procedures were completed. The person was carried out, feet high and head low, and the operating table was empty, waiting for another person to come.</p>
<p>Spare No Expense to Save Lives</p>
<p>Life is highly valued here. The doctors here truly treat each person as a person, without despising them because of their poverty. The Novcain used for the spinal anesthesia injected into that rickshaw puller is said to be worth 100,000 yuan per injection. At the same time, this person was also injected with morphine for pain relief and sedative tranquilizers. Glucose calcium, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, tetanus antitoxin, and Lai's leaves were also used. Adding gauze, cotton, adhesive plaster, and food expenses, it cost more than 3 million yuan on this person alone. Many medicines were not used just once, but injected every day or every other day. If they were a little careless, many leaves could have been saved and not used, but if that were true, the energy of the injured would be greatly depleted, and the resistance would be even less, which might cause more danger. In order to thoroughly save a person, they spared no expense to use some of the only medicines in their hospital. Tetanus antitoxin is only used for severely injured people, even those who are slightly injured. They value their work and the lives of the injured, and generously use valuable medicines to rescue these people from death. The hospital's direction of serving the community, and the kind doctors who care for every poor wounded with the utmost care and attention, are</p>
<p>Obviously, Jimin Hospital deserves our help. The various medicines mentioned above, as well as rice, cash, blankets, and straw mats, are what they urgently need. It is hoped that all parties will donate generously. At the same time, the reporter is willing to introduce this free hospital with the utmost trust, which does not neglect human lives.</p>
