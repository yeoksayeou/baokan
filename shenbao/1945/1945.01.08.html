<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>近一月來的上海物價，是在超速度地飛漲着。普通薪水階級和工人的死板收入，自然杯水車薪，無濟於事，即企業家對職員及工人的生活費實際上也不可能保證隨物價而提高，這旣然是人所共曉的事實，所以業已達到不是薪水階級和工人停止作人，就是企業家停止營業的日暮途窮階段了。本來戰時經濟中，所謂民需生產量削減，通貨發行額擴大，這是難免的必然現象，所以街頭巷尾的一般人都在評論，如不澈底實行消費節的，如不推行勸募公債，如不普及擴大人民貯落，以收回通貨，而求物價解決，則不啻樣木求魚。假如這一說法果爲一針見血的正言讜論，則今日這樣畸形政治狀態下的上海物價問題，自然也就不能不令人悲觀，望而却步了。第一，最近一年來上海的民需生產，一落千丈，而中儲券發行額則自湘桂作戰以來，顯著增加。所謂對策的「消費節約」，只不過是空口呌囂，虛張聲勢而已。至於推行公債和人民貯蓄所造成的通貨回流量，則比目前通貨發行額來說，實等於「九牛一毛」，「滄海一粟」。現狀旣如是，那末上海的物價飛漲，無論由那一個角度來看，豈不都是必不可免的現象麼？因此，一般人都大失所望，認爲上海的物價對策，至多全不過是畫餅充飢，望梅止渴的空頭設計而已，至於有效而兌現的設計，是絕對沒有的。然則根據通貨與物資關係的普通原則，能解說上海的物價現象麽？我認爲這種普通原則，反蒙蔽了上海物價現象的本來面目。自然，任何人都不能否認，通貨發行額增加和民需生產量減少所造成的基本物價上昇，是最近物價暴漲的基礎。然而現實物價，則遠超過這一基本物價的上昇，因此我認爲與普通原則無關，而是另有其他因素在作祟。關於這一事實，本想用實際數字來說明，但因關於物價的數字禁止發表，所以只好把人所共知的米價引來，作一概略的叙述。最近在〇天內，米價竟由〇萬元大關，一躍而至〇萬元大關。　不啻在〇天內增加了將近〇倍。然而誰也不相信，在這個期間內「通貨」和「物資」起了這樣多的變化。即單從這一點看，也可以明瞭，如用通貨和物資的關係來說明上海的物價現象，是絕對不可靠的。然則目前決定上海的物價現象者，究竟是什麼？我認爲最大的因素，就是中國人對中儲券的不信任的心理。近兩三月來中儲券的購買力，的確跌落得驚人。其跌落速度，正如夏天掌上的冰一樣，眨眼間就溶化得無影無踪。民衆們都在絞腦榨汁地考慮，掌中的中儲券在尙未溶解之前，如何早日換成其他物品，以保存其原有價値。民衆正如不使冰白白溶解，而放入冰箱內保存一樣，對於中儲券在天天尋找「冰箱」。這就是中國人所說的囤積行爲。對於某個時期或某種人來說，囤積是追求不當利益的不當行爲，這就應當加以澈底取締。然而這樣的囤積，尙是比較的少數，實際上，以囤積爲維持起碼生活一個手段的，却比比皆是。最近我曾蒙某當局見示上海工人收入及生活費的統計，其中上海某種特殊勞動者的工資，最近曾大加提高，然而比較生活費的飛漲，仍望塵莫及，瞠乎其後。除掉一二特殊勞動者外，幾乎全部都在過着借債生活。借債由什麽來彌補呢？大部份工人，本身都兼營物資囤積事業，且使家族協助進行囤貨之出籠工作，藉此以茍延殘喘。再稍加充裕的薪水階級，則買賣股票及金條，以及囤積，凡所能買進的一切物資。至於資本家，旣沒有可能投資的生產企業，縱有也不可能担負不斷上騰的工人生活費，所以大部份只好把資本用之於大規模的囤積上。在本文的開頭已經講過，現在業已達到不是薪水階級和工人停止工作，就是企業家停止營業的山窮水盡階段了，按目前現狀說，無論資本家，也無論工人，全都停止了自己的本位工作。就是說，二者搖身一變，以財富流通過程上的「商人」形態，企圖抵抗物價暴漲之害於萬一。職是之故，上海的資本與勞動，則脫離財富的生產過程，而轉向流通過程）結果生產愈益一蹶不振，而流通過程上的相互競爭，則愈益劇烈。因而商品市塲上的需求者不斷增加，而供給者不斷減少，於是便只有促成物價的不斷上漲。由此觀之，物價上漲，決非因生產與通貨的絕對關係，主因乃是對通貨的特殊態度所發生之特殊現象。如簡單地用圖表來表示，則如左。圖中的AB綫爲通貨與物資間關係的物價上昇綫，a，b，綫爲現實的物價上昇綫。A，a間隔與B，b間隔之不同，就是由於對中儲券不信任的原因而造成的物價騰貴的部份。這就是現實物價。現實物價旣如是，那末恢復人心對中儲券的信仰，起碼可使物價不按ab錢上昇，而將按AB綫上昇，換言之，即可把現實物價壓低到通貨與物資間關係的常態物價上昇錢上。所以按我個人的意見說，現在的物價暴漲，主因在於懷疑中儲券的購買能力，如在這一點上加以調整，則物價即可顯著降低。不然，如認爲現實物價從未脫離AB錢上昇，則對策只有實行「獎勵貯畜」，「取締囤積」，「增加生產」。然而這三樁工作，在未解消人民對中儲券的恐慌心理之前，是無法收到成效的。所以如不首先糾正恐慌心理，則調整物價將是絕無希望的。爲證明這一點，先就目前提到議事日程上的「貯畜」，加以簡單說明。</p>
<p>貯蓄也者，乃是以今日不必要的財，貯藏起來以備他日之用的意思，然而現在縱想把中儲券存於銀行，以備一年後使用，但至明年今月這筆款子的偎値，竟消逝了數成，這樣還有爲「貯畜」而存款於銀行的大傻瓜麽？所以目前上海，站在私經濟的立塲上而貯蓄的人，恐怕早已絕跡人間。（在這一點上，一九四四年十二月十七日大陸新報載，日本大使館岡崎參事官的談話，是極堪注目的）。再從銀行家的立塲看，現在從存戶收到一百萬元儲鈔，一月後按法定銀行利息付還存戶一萬元的本利，則銀行顯然得到了不當利益。因爲存戶存入一萬元，就是以具有一萬元儲鈔的價値（即購一萬元儲鈔的購買力）存入的，一月後存戶取出時，如中儲券購買減少一半，則存戶實際上只不過收到了五千元。像存款於銀行的這樣不折不扣的十足「阿木林」，在上海的中國人間，尙不多見。所以據說上海的各中國銀行，差不多完全收不到貯蓄性的存款。總之，中儲券的購買力旣然像今日這樣念劇的跌落，那末「獎勵貯蓄」，也會像一向的「取締囤積「增加生產」口號一樣，將成爲虛張聲勢的空頭喊呌而已。</p>
<p>所以我認爲富前迫不容緩的急務，乃是如何解除民衆對中儲券的恐慌心理。關於這一點，不佞有一個提案。今日物價之所以高漲，並非因物資絕對量多寡的直接關係，而是因出現於黑市的物資量，比需求者所要求的物資量過少所致。換言之就是因爲囤積把市塲弄得狹小了。自然，今日爭先恐後於囤積的理由，主要都是爲保存貨幣價値（即保存貨幣購買力）。假如能保存住貨幣的購買力，則囤積不待取締而自然減少。本來保證貨幣購買力的鞏固，這是政府的責任。所以，國立中央銀行必須保證貨幣購買力的穩定。就是說，中央儲備銀行代收存戶的儲鈔時，即是代存其儲鈔購買力，那末在償還時，自屬應當不折不扣償還其購買力。假如一條黃金五十萬元時，存入五十萬元，而一月後一條黃金六十萬元時，則宜償還六十萬元，黃金七十萬元時，則宜償還七十萬元。果如建立這樣辦法，則誰也不再想購置不方便的金條了。而都放心把錢存到銀行裏。假如說，只靠金條爲購買力的基準或有危險，則可以三四樣重要物資的平均價値，作爲中儲券購買力的基準。</p>
<p>也許將有人說，這樣作，則國家的損失太大，會招致中儲券發行額愈大，而通貨膨脹愈甚的結果。但我所說的辦法建立起來後，則流通於市面的中儲券可以回流，所以用不着杞憂。如購買力基準的物資價格暴漲時，则政府宜施以適當的市塲調劑工作。政府爲實行物資的市塲調劑工作，自然必須先有某種程度上的物資準備，然而利用這種方法，並不是爲了實際需要物資，而是爲保持中儲券價値，這樣囤積的物資是有出籠可能性的，所以基準物資的偎格可能自然作相當的低落。自然這種辦法，單純可能壓制目前因恐慌心理而造成的物價上昇，並不可能根本抑平物價。然而如不首先抑平目前這樣的物價暴騰，則任何根本抑制物價的政第，都會失敗。無論政策如何，但民衆本身都在設計保存中儲券購買力的方法，盡可能地實行囤積，而不知不覺造成物資市塲的狹小，物價的暴漲，此情此景，實難於令人默爾而息。我所主張的辦法，即政府代替人民保證中儲券的購買員力，解除人民自己囤積的必要性，在不知不覺中擴大狹小的物資市塲，物價下洛，可立而待。我認爲建立這種辦法後，物價至少可以按通貨與物資間的關係，下洛到戰時正常通貨膨脹的上昇綫上。</p>
<p>本來，後方人民生活的動搖與吾，是決定長期戰爭的主要因素者，那末當前的物價問題，實際上並非是戰時經濟的一個問題，老實說，是議爭本身的一個塲面。在這一意義上，不禁令我希望當局早日確定和施行這樣安定物價的政策。（靖譯）</p>

<p>從大東亞戰爭而言，今年是決戰的一年，從國內政治而言，今年是非革新不可的一年；從各方面的期望來說，都着眼於民生的安定，而民生的安定，必先期政治能上軌道。要求政治上軌道的第一件事，首先肅淸貪汚。這樣可以說，肅淸貪汚是今年第一件大事情。政治上要舉行競賽，也以此爲總目標。</p>
<p>貪汚風氣的瀰漫，已成爲目前政治上第一個大敵人。官塲中一部分的貪汚，已經造成社會上的道德問題。譬如中國商人，本來就缺少國家民族的觀念，一向唯利是圖，歷史上有「奸商」之稱。平時就善於營私納賄，沒有縫還想鑽，所以，官塲中貪汚之門一開，他們更能神通廣大，無事不用其賄，越益增高了官塲中的貪汚風氣。另一方面，把一切賄賂用途，加在物價上，由老百姐去担負，抬高物價，從中暴利。同時，勾結官僚，官僚亦樂與他們結合，商人更無忌憚，目無法紀，成了無國籍的猶太人，不知國家民族，只知暴利，物價到了一般人不能活下去了的程度，他們還在哈哈的「看高」，像吃人的野獸一樣。這種暴利主義者的商人，萬分可恨，罪無可赦。但是，我們回想一下，如官塲中無路可賄，那末，這般「奸商」雖有通神之錢，也無能施其技倆，更不敢作害民利己之想，以干法紀。商人道德墮落到今日地步，不能不歸結吏治上去。</p>
<p>其次，貪汚心理產生的基礎，一般言之，是由於經濟困難。某些小貪汚，開始時萌念於薪水不能維持生活，不得已而出此，在上者不加以禁止，正如陳代主席在就職訓詞中所說：「……負各方面之責者，或以官吏生活困苦，略迹瞻循，或以僚屬過去勛勞，原情減罪……」久而久之，成了政治上一種壞風氣，而且早已脫出減少生活困苦的範圍，以此爲發財手段，過去生活困苦者，今已面團團富家翁了。這樣，更加激勵了生活尙困苦者，走上貪汚之道，迎頭趕上。自然貪汚之風，一發不可遏止了。</p>
<p>語云：「人必目侮而後人侮之」。正在求國家獨立，民族自由的時候，我們自己負着救國救民責任的官吏之中，先有一部分不肖行爲，不能不引爲萬分遺憾。然而，我們又不能不對負政治責任的官吏有所希望，希望他們能切實反省過去。從今以後，萬不可再瞻循減罪，姑息下屬。從「私行立而公利滅」的錯誤中轉到「公利立而私行滅」，進而樹立「爲國忘己」「有國無我」的精神，猶不爲晚。</p>
<p>政治上壤的風氣，固然由於少數人造成，同時，好的風氣，也可以由於少數人形成。允其是高級官吏厲行自肅，以身作則，則上行下效，不難蔚爲風氣。例如最近中樞一部分機關，及浙江省政，安徽省政，有逐漸走向修明之途的風氣。我們希望日有進步，擴大範圍。最應任意縣區政治，因爲縣政是最直接與民衆有關，以期逐漸造成整個政治的良好風氣。</p>
<p>陳代主席日前在上海五團體的歡迎會致訓詞，中間提到汪先生「爲國忘己」「有國無我」的精神時，熱淚盈眶。我們相信不是因爲要他來實踐這樣精神而悲傷，是悲傷能理解而能實踐這種精神的人太少，我們應深切去體會陳代主席的苦衷，以「爲國忘己」的精神去突破今天政治上的貪汚。</p>

<p>南京七日中央社電緬甸副總理達金米亞氏，以國府參戰瞬屆二週年，時發表祝勉聲明如次：國民政府於日本向英美布告宣戰後之一年餘，毅然向全國宣告其歷史的決定，而參加大東亞戰，北次戰爭蓋亦爲終結中日事變而發動者，是國府此種與大東亞各國遝命相共之決定，有其深長意義。試觀國府向英美布吿宣戰之經過，可視中日兩國之在大東亞地域中互相協力，乃屬當然，且爲永久打破英美之干涉與榨取，亦屬必要。故國府於一九四三年一月九日之毅然奮起，乃爲確立東亞和平與共同繁榮之基礎而決定者。中國之先哲，早有提倡和平之說，中國國父孫中山先生，曾倡大亞洲主義，指出中國如不與日本互相理解協力，中國即難復興，此在全東亞大之記憶中，固所異常清淅。汪故主席繼承孫先生之遺訓，首即不斷努力，以謀全面和平之實現。國民政府於對英美宣戰佈吿中，曾表明中日兩國之共同利害關係，關明示中國之參戰，乃爲謀國家之復興，東亞之解放，此實深堪敬佩者。茲當中國參戰兩週年紀念，中日協力益形緊密，並將因軍事的政治的成果，在精神上，物質上，亦益臻堅固基礎。吾人於此，謹與中國上下互相策勵，以爲戰爭之早日勝利。</p>

<h3 id="c27">安定物價與安定民生 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 瑜</p>
<p>在今日物價狂漲，漫無止境，民生塗炭，無以聊生的環境下，政府當局所應聚精會神，冥思苦索，以求解決的，恐怕不會再逾此一問題了。尤其上海市府當局，身歷其境，首當其斯，目擊管轄下五百萬市民，除少數發國難財和富有者外，大都呻吟哀號，呼吸倒懸，徬徨不可終日，寗能忽然於懷，無動於中，出之水火而登之袵蓆，不但是大政治家應有的抱負，亦是大政治家應有的責任，所謂當仁不讓，所謂義無返顧，眞可爲上海市府當局道。</p>
<p>自從事變爆發以來，上海物價，即在上漲，可是上漲的程度，惟到最近而速率更增。平時十元左右一担的米，在民國三十三正二月時，黑市米價，猶不過二千餘元一担，可是至同年十二月，最高時在漲達六萬五千元一石，而在比較安定時，亦在四萬六七千元左右，換言之，即上海米價，較平時飛漲四千六七百倍，即在一年之中，亦飛漲達二十餘倍。再就煤球言，平時一担百市斤，不過八角左右，可是最近一担要三千五百元，而在民國三十三年正二月時，黑市煤球價格，尙不過二百元不足，雖則原料與火力，遠不能同以前好的比較，但是上漲程席，亦有四千四百餘倍，而一年之四，亦飛漲至二十餘倍。與民生關係最密切的，無過於「吃」，而米糧與煤球，又是「吃的問題」中最主要的，衣服可以少做，居住可以簡陋，可是肚皮不能不飽，惟是物價這樣狂漲，一般中人之家，平昔仰賴薪給所入，來維持一家八口的，對於「吃的問題」，眞有無法應付的苦痛。今試按最近生活情形，以一家入口計，預算一個月的開支，列表如下：</p>
<p>上表所列，係以一家入口爲標凖，按照最近情况，最低生活的維持費，已須十萬餘元，但是一般薪水階級，收入能符合此標準的，恐怕絕無僅有，何况來日大難，有增無已，如不設法戢止，不但薪水階級，均要崩潰，且要擾亂社會經濟機構，釀成不可收拾的危機。</p>
<p>由於物價的瘋狂上昇，無法遏抑，所以民生憔悴，顚沛萬狀，吾國素有「民爲貴」，又有「民爲邦本，本固邦寗」之說，而上海市政當局，對於安定物價，安定民生，又是職責攸關，義難袖手，所以筆者不憚辭費，略貢管見，以當芻獻。</p>
<p>（一）充實配給　滬市配給的日用品，計有米，麵粉，雜糧，煤球，油，鹽，肥皂，火柴等等，對於民生衣食所需者，可說所缺無多，物品配給的價格，也很合理；所可惜的就是數量太少，而且常常延期，當局的困難，市民決非漠視，可是市民的困難，惟有希望當局來解決，且應排除萬難，悉力以赴，方能奏效。如其一應物資多能按期足量配給，則黑市價格，何由猖獗，市民生活，亦可安定。</p>
<p>（一）疏通來源　爲求配給制度，達到圓滑滿意的地步，使得人民都能維持最低生活起見，非從敏活運輸機構，暢通國內物資來源不可。年來滬市物價飛漲，原因固然很多，可是「貨不能暢其流」，實爲主因之一。爲了實施統制起見，可由政府統籌辦理，但是當局以前所辦的成績，實在不能使人民滿意，同時單帮盛行，亦祇有促成物價的上漲。所以從市民的立塲言，最好政府對於物資運輸，能有涌盤計劃，負責辦理，否則亦應允許殷富商人和有經騐商人辦理，而實施監督，限制利潤，物資的來源如能暢通，則生產旣可增加，物價亦可安定，人民的生活，尙有不能維持的痛苦嗎？</p>
<p>（三）取締暴利商人本是謀利。而在戰爭期間，由於國際孔道斷絕，來源不繼，乘機操縱國積，大發其國難財者，比比皆是，一方面大多數人民，受高物價之壓迫，輾　呼號，不知死所。此等畸形現象，旣然違背統制原則，而民破壞法令尊嚴。眞可謂商人成功萬骨枯了。「德國哈巴博士，某次到日本演講第一次世界大戰，德國失敗的原因時，言及戰時商人暴富情狀，聲淚俱下」。應知取締暴利，乃是政府職責所在，而在戰時，更應澈底排除。如其此點不能做到，不但物價更要飛漲，而且大多數人民，困於生活問題，對於團結禦侮，協力戰爭，均屬有心無力無法實現。</p>
<p>（四）屛絕貪汚商人的漁利，本屬天性，如其政府鐵面無私，出而干涉，未嘗不可收制裁之效。所遺憾的官吏與商人互相勾結，狼狽爲奸，那就火上加油，一發不可收拾，人民痛苦，祇有加深，決無減少的可能。年來綱紀失墜，威令不行，貪汚之風，相沿成習。遠之如米糧舞弊一案，近之如營業特稅一案，可說是犖犖大者，其他較小案件，更是指不勝屈。由於官商的連結，貪汚的盛行，物價的狂漲，乃如燎原之火，泛濫之水，而所謂統制其名者，乃助漲其實。所以要想安定物價，要想安定民生，屛除貪汚，亦是重點之一。</p>
<p>上海是我國的金融中心，工商巨埠。經濟上的地位，本極重要。年來因爲又是戰時體制的大本營，統制施策的策源地，所以政治上的重要性，亦日漸顯著。因之上海的一舉一動，足以影響到全國，波及於各地，即說繫全國的觀瞻，亦甚恰當。如何使得此東亞巨埠，生產發展，民生昭蘇，不但是市政當局的職責，亦是全體市民所渴望。値此一元復始，萬象更新，民國三十四年度倏忽來臨之際，上海市政當局，亦有一番更迭。猶憶洪羊敉平後，湘鄕曾文正公，以督師而督兩江，勤政愛民，棠愛永留。今周羅兩先生，亦是湘人，當茲物價狂漲，民不聊生之時，出而主持上海市政，定能一本湘人堅苦舊絕，勤奮耐勞之習慣，躬自督導，以身作則，爲人民謀幸福，爲上海謀繁榮。不禁馨香以祝，拭目以望。</p>

<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:10 PM on the 7th: (1) Enemy warships, under the cover of a mobile force, appeared in the waters west of Luzon Island and entered Lingayen Gulf on the morning of January 6th, currently shelling the coast of the Gulf with naval artillery. (2) On the same afternoon, a strong enemy transport convoy was seen advancing westward from the sea south of Mindoro Island and Mindanao. (3) Japanese air units have been continuously bombing these enemy warships since the 13th, and by the evening of the 6th, the results of the battle were determined as follows (including previously announced results): Three enemy aircraft carriers sunk. One battleship sunk. Two battleships or cruisers sunk. One cruiser sunk, sixteen enemy transport ships sunk, three enemy aircraft carriers destroyed. Two battleships or cruisers destroyed. One large ship of unknown type sunk. One destroyer sunk. And two transport ships sunk.</p>
<p>Philippine Japanese Army Base, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force has launched daily attacks on enemy convoys and mobile forces attempting to invade Luzon Island. On the night of the 6th, one unit of the Japanese Kamikaze Force broke into an enemy convoy patrolling the waters southwest of Negros Island, sinking one large transport ship and heavily damaging one large enemy battleship cruiser. In addition, enemy warship groups were discovered successively in the Sulu Sea and the Mindanao Sea on the afternoon of the 6th. The attacks achieved considerable results, but due to fierce battles between Japanese escort fighters and enemy aircraft, the results could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Special Attack Force "Kongo Unit" discovered an enemy transport convoy sailing south of Negros Island on the 6th, and immediately launched an attack, annihilating it and inflicting heavy damage.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - The war situation for the past week is as follows:</p>
<p>China Front</p>
<p>In aerial warfare, continuous attacks were launched on Suichuan, Laohekou, Ankang, and other places, achieving significant results.</p>
<p>Japanese Mainland</p>
<p>When enemy aircraft from Mariana bases raided the vicinity of the capital on the 27th of last month, Japanese forces shot down 41 planes, or 80% of the attacking force, inflicting heavy damage. However, small numbers of enemy planes continued to conduct reconnaissance and raids almost daily, aiming for psychological warfare. On the afternoon of the 3rd, approximately 90 enemy aircraft, primarily targeting Nagoya, and another part attacked the vicinity of Osaka and Hamamatsu. During this raid, enemy aircraft began indiscriminately bombing urban areas. In response, Japanese air units launched strong attacks on Saipan Island on January 2nd and 3rd, inflicting heavy damage. On the other hand, to weaken the Ogasawara Islands, the forward base of the Japanese mainland, a small enemy naval force shelled Chichijima and Hahajima on the morning of January 5th, while enemy aircraft repeatedly raided the southwestern islands with small numbers of aircraft more than a dozen times at night. On the Taiwan front, the enemy attempted to cut off Japanese supply lines to the Philippines, with a powerful mobile force appearing in the waters near Taiwan, launching attacks on various parts of Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands with 1,500 carrier-based aircraft on the morning of the 3rd and 400 aircraft on the 4th. Although no enemy aircraft appeared after the 5th, the enemy mobile force continued to patrol the waters east of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Burma Front</p>
<p>In the Nujiang area, the enemy Yunnan Expeditionary Force added two divisions to the 9th Division of the 11th and 20th Army Groups and advanced to the Nujiang area. The first line is currently northwest of Jiashong and near Manmeng, attempting to attack Wanting. Although a portion of the enemy is advancing on the front, it is not of great significance. In northern Burma, a portion of the American-equipped Yu Army advanced to the vicinity of Bhamo, and several British-Indian divisions advanced to the railway line along Myitkyina and the vicinity of Katha and Indaw, coordinating with the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, and their activity is extremely active. Furthermore, the first line of the enemy forces on the Kaladan River front has advanced to the Seing Bu Taung-Buthidaung line and is currently attempting to continue advancing. On the Arakan front, the enemy is advancing along the Kaladan River valley, and the 25th and 26th Divisions are gradually advancing on both sides of the area. Japanese garrison units are bravely fighting on all fronts, ambushing the enemy everywhere.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific</p>
<p>Enemy aircraft continue to launch large-scale attacks on Halmahera Island. From December 29th to January 2nd, in just five days, the total number of enemy small and medium-sized aircraft reached as many as 381. In Ambon, small formations flying from Halmahera raided daily, with a total of about 80 aircraft over the three days of January 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. On Morotai Island, Japanese ground troops continue to engage in courageous ambush operations, occupying positions on December 25th. The enemy, supported by strong reinforcements from the Barbaro area, attempted to hold the positions, but the Japanese launched surprise attacks, killing over 225 enemy soldiers, destroying four bunkers and two anti-aircraft positions, and one ammunition depot. Japanese garrison troops are still engaged in courageous ambush operations with a small number of troops on Peleliu Island and Angaur Island.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Enemy Planes Attacking Kyushu Shot Down Three, Damaged Over Ten <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency telegram) - Seventy or eighty B-29 type aircraft raided western Kyushu on the morning of the 6th. Japanese air defense forces bravely intercepted them under extremely difficult conditions of dense, layered clouds. It was later confirmed that three enemy aircraft were shot down, and more than ten others were damaged, with a considerable number of them appearing to have been shot down.</p>
<p>Philippine Islands</p>
<p>On Leyte Island, the enemy forces who landed in Barenben landed in the area between Baren City and San Isidro with boat mobile units. The Japanese troops in the area intercepted them and completely repelled them. There was no major change in the land operations on Leyte Island and Mindoro Island. The Japanese air force and special flying units, and Kamikaze Special Attack Force, have been attacking the waters near the Philippines and enemy airfields daily, achieving glorious feats. On January 5th, a strong enemy transport convoy, under the cover of a mobile force, appeared west of Luzon Island, attempting to land on Luzon Island.</p>
<p>Indian Ocean</p>
<p>In response to the urgent situation of the Philippine battle, the British fleet and others attacked the northern district of Sumatra with approximately 80 carrier-based aircraft on the morning of the 4th but were bravely intercepted by the Japanese forces, suffering damage and fleeing. There has been no major activity since. In short, the battle surrounding the Philippines is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<h3 id="e4">A Proposal for Stabilizing Prices <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— by Higashisuke Yoshida</p>
<p>Over the past month, prices in Shanghai have been soaring at an accelerated rate. The fixed income of ordinary salaried workers and laborers is naturally a drop in the bucket and of no use. Even entrepreneurs cannot realistically guarantee that the living expenses of their employees and workers will increase in proportion to prices. Since this is a fact known to all, it has already reached a dead end where salaried workers and laborers will either cease to be human, or entrepreneurs will cease to operate their businesses. In a wartime economy, it is inevitable that civilian production will be reduced and the amount of currency issued will be expanded. Therefore, everyone on the street is commenting that if consumption is not thoroughly curtailed, if public bonds are not promoted, and if people's savings are not popularized and expanded to withdraw currency, then seeking price solutions is akin to climbing a tree to catch fish. If this argument is indeed a penetrating and honest opinion, then the Shanghai price problem under today's abnormal political situation cannot but make people pessimistic and discouraged. First, over the past year, civilian production in Shanghai has plummeted, while the amount of Central Reserve Bank notes issued has increased significantly since the Xiang-Gui campaign. The so-called countermeasure of "consumption reduction" is merely empty rhetoric and a show of force. As for the currency withdrawal caused by the promotion of public bonds and people's savings, it is really like "a drop in the ocean" compared to the current amount of currency in circulation. Given the current situation, is not the soaring price in Shanghai an inevitable phenomenon from any point of view? Therefore, most people are greatly disappointed, believing that the price countermeasures in Shanghai are at best empty designs like drawing cakes to satisfy hunger or quenching thirst with plums, and that there are absolutely no effective and realistic designs. Then, can the ordinary principle of the relationship between currency and goods explain the Shanghai price phenomenon? I believe that this ordinary principle obscures the true face of the Shanghai price phenomenon. Naturally, no one can deny that the basic price increase caused by the increase in the amount of currency issued and the decrease in civilian production is the basis of the recent surge in prices. However, the actual prices far exceed this basic price increase, so I believe that it is unrelated to ordinary principles and that there are other factors at play. I originally wanted to use actual figures to illustrate this fact, but because the publication of price figures is prohibited, I can only cite the commonly known rice price for a general description. Recently, within 〇 days, the price of rice jumped from the 〇 ten thousand yuan mark to the 〇 ten thousand yuan mark, an increase of nearly 〇 times in 〇 days. However, no one believes that the "currency" and "goods" have changed that much during this period. Even from this point alone, it can be understood that it is absolutely unreliable to use the relationship between currency and goods to explain the Shanghai price phenomenon. So what is currently determining the Shanghai price phenomenon? I believe that the biggest factor is the Chinese people's distrust of Central Reserve Bank notes. In the past two or three months, the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes has indeed fallen alarmingly. Its rate of decline is like ice in the palm of your hand in summer, melting away in the blink of an eye. People are racking their brains to figure out how to exchange the Central Reserve Bank notes in their hands for other goods as soon as possible before they melt, in order to preserve their original value. People are looking for a "refrigerator" for Central Reserve Bank notes every day, just like preserving ice in a refrigerator to prevent it from melting in vain. This is what the Chinese call hoarding. For a certain period or for certain people, hoarding is an inappropriate act of pursuing improper profits, and it should be thoroughly investigated and punished. However, such hoarding is still relatively rare. In reality, there are many more people who use hoarding as a means of maintaining a minimum standard of living. Recently, I was shown statistics on the income and living expenses of Shanghai workers by a certain authority. Among them, the wages of a certain special type of laborer in Shanghai have been greatly increased recently. However, compared to the soaring cost of living, they are still far behind. With the exception of one or two special laborers, almost all of them are living on borrowed money. What do they use to make up for the borrowed money? Most workers themselves also engage in the business of hoarding goods, and their families help with the unloading of goods, thereby eking out a living. Salaried workers with slightly more income buy and sell stocks and gold bars, as well as hoard all the goods they can buy. As for capitalists, there are no production enterprises to invest in, and even if there are, they cannot afford the ever-increasing living expenses of workers, so most of them have to use their capital for large-scale hoarding. As I said at the beginning of this article, it has now reached the dead end where salaried workers and laborers will either stop working, or entrepreneurs will stop operating their businesses. As it stands, neither capitalists nor workers are doing their proper jobs. That is, both of them transform themselves into "merchants" in the wealth flow process, trying to resist the harm of the soaring prices. Therefore, the capital and labor of Shanghai are separated from the wealth production process and turn to the circulation process. As a result, production becomes increasingly depressed, and competition in the circulation process becomes increasingly fierce. As a result, the number of buyers in the commodity market is constantly increasing, and the number of suppliers is constantly decreasing, which only promotes the continuous rise in prices. From this point of view, the price increase is not determined by the absolute relationship between production and currency, but mainly by the special phenomenon caused by the special attitude towards currency. If expressed simply in a graph, it is as follows. The AB line in the graph is the price increase line related to the relationship between currency and goods, and the a, b lines are the actual price increase lines. The difference between the A, a interval and the B, b interval is the part of the price increase caused by the distrust of Central Reserve Bank notes. This is the reality of prices. Given the reality of prices, restoring people's faith in Central Reserve Bank notes can at least prevent prices from rising along the ab line, but will rise along the AB line, in other words, the actual prices can be reduced to the normal price increase line related to the relationship between currency and goods. So, in my opinion, the main reason for the current price surge is the suspicion of the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes. If this can be adjusted, then prices can be significantly reduced. Otherwise, if it is believed that actual prices have never deviated from rising along the AB line, then the countermeasures can only be to implement "encouraging savings," "suppressing hoarding," and "increasing production." However, these three tasks cannot be effective until the people's panic about Central Reserve Bank notes is resolved. So, if the panic is not corrected first, then adjusting prices will be hopeless. To prove this point, let's start with a brief explanation of the "savings" that are currently on the agenda.</p>
<p>Saving means storing unnecessary wealth today for use in the future. However, even if you want to deposit Central Reserve Bank notes in a bank today for use a year later, the value of the money will have disappeared several times by this time next year. Who would be such a fool to deposit money in a bank for the sake of "saving"? Therefore, in Shanghai today, there are probably no people left who are saving from a private economic standpoint. (In this regard, the remarks of Consul Okazaki of the Japanese Embassy, published in the Continental New Report on December 17, 1944, are extremely noteworthy.) From the banker's standpoint, if a bank receives one million yuan in savings from a depositor today, and pays the depositor 10,000 yuan in principal and interest after one month, the bank obviously gets an unfair profit. Because the depositor deposits one million yuan, which has the value of one million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes (i.e., the purchasing power of one million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes). If the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes is reduced by half when the depositor withdraws it a month later, then the depositor actually only receives 500,000 yuan. Such a complete "fool" who deposits money in the bank is rare among the Chinese people in Shanghai. Therefore, it is said that Shanghai's Chinese banks receive almost no savings deposits at all. In short, since the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes is falling so dramatically today, then "encouraging savings" will become an empty slogan, just like the usual "suppressing hoarding" and "increasing production" slogans.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that the urgent task ahead is how to dispel the public's panic about Central Reserve Bank notes. On this point, I have a proposal. The reason why prices are high today is not directly related to the absolute quantity of goods, but because the amount of goods appearing on the black market is too small compared to the amount of goods demanded by buyers. In other words, hoarding has narrowed the market. Naturally, the main reason for the rush to hoard today is to preserve the value of money (i.e., to preserve the purchasing power of money). If the purchasing power of money can be preserved, then hoarding will naturally decrease without suppression. It is the government's responsibility to guarantee the stability of the purchasing power of money. Therefore, the National Central Bank must guarantee the stability of the purchasing power of money. That is, when the Central Reserve Bank collects savings from depositors, it is saving the purchasing power of their savings. Then, when repaying, it should naturally repay the purchasing power in full. If a gold bar costs 500,000 yuan, and 500,000 yuan is deposited, and a gold bar costs 600,000 yuan a month later, then 600,000 yuan should be repaid. If a gold bar costs 700,000 yuan, then 700,000 yuan should be repaid. If such a method is established, then no one will want to buy inconvenient gold bars anymore, and everyone will feel at ease depositing money in the bank. If it is said that relying solely on gold bars as the benchmark for purchasing power is risky, then the average value of three or four important goods can be used as the benchmark for the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<p>Some may say that this will result in too much loss to the country, which will lead to a larger amount of Central Reserve Bank notes issued and even more inflation. But after the method I mentioned is established, the Central Reserve Bank notes circulating in the market can return, so there is no need to worry. If the price of the purchasing power benchmark goods soars, then the government should implement appropriate market adjustment measures. To implement market adjustment measures for goods, the government must naturally first have a certain degree of goods reserves. However, using this method is not for the actual need for goods, but for maintaining the value of Central Reserve Bank notes. Such hoarding of goods has the possibility of being released into the market, so the price of benchmark goods may naturally fall considerably. Naturally, this method can only suppress the current price increase caused by panic, and cannot fundamentally suppress prices. However, if we do not first suppress the current price surge, then any fundamental price suppression policy will fail. Regardless of the policy, but the people themselves are designing ways to preserve the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes, hoarding as much as possible, and unknowingly causing the shrinking of the commodity market and the soaring of prices. This situation is difficult to ignore. The method I advocate is that the government should guarantee the purchasing power of Central Reserve Bank notes on behalf of the people, eliminating the need for the people to hoard themselves, and unknowingly expanding the narrow commodity market. The price will fall, and this can be expected to happen quickly. I believe that after this method is established, prices can at least fall to the wartime normal inflation increase line according to the relationship between currency and goods.</p>
<p>Originally, the turmoil and unease of the people's lives in the rear are the main factors determining a long-term war. Then, the current price problem is actually not a problem of the wartime economy. To be honest, it is a battlefield of the war itself. In this sense, I cannot help but hope that the authorities will determine and implement such a price stabilization policy as soon as possible. (Translated by Jing)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Forgetting Self for the Country <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>From the perspective of the Greater East Asia War, this year is the year of decisive battle. From the perspective of domestic politics, this year is a year in which reform is a must. From the perspective of all aspects of expectation, everyone is focusing on the stability of the people's livelihood, and the stability of the people's livelihood must first ensure that politics is on the right track. The first thing to demand that politics be on the right track is to eradicate corruption. It can be said that eradicating corruption is the first major event this year. Political competition should also take this as the overall goal.</p>
<p>The prevalence of corruption has become the number one enemy in current politics. The corruption of a portion of officials has already created a moral problem in society. For example, Chinese merchants inherently lack the concept of the country and the nation. They have always been profit-oriented and have been historically called "treacherous merchants." In peacetime, they are good at seeking private gain and accepting bribes. If there is no opportunity, they will create one. Therefore, once the door to corruption is opened, they can become even more powerful and do not hesitate to use bribes for everything, further increasing the corruption in the officialdom. On the other hand, they add all the bribery costs to the prices, which are borne by the ordinary people, raising prices and making exorbitant profits. At the same time, they collude with bureaucrats, and the bureaucrats are happy to combine with them. The merchants become even more unscrupulous, disregarding the law, becoming stateless Jews, knowing only exorbitant profits, and not knowing the country and the nation. When prices reach the point where ordinary people can no longer live, they are still laughing and "looking high," like man-eating beasts. Such merchants with profiteering ideology are extremely hateful and unforgivable. However, let us think about it. If there is no way to bribe officials, then even if these "treacherous merchants" have supernatural money, they will not be able to use their tricks, and they will not dare to think of harming the people and benefiting themselves in violation of the law. The moral degeneration of merchants to this point cannot be attributed to the governance of officials.</p>
<p>Secondly, the foundation of the corruption mentality, generally speaking, is due to economic hardship. Some minor corruption starts with the idea that salaries cannot maintain life, and they have no choice but to do this. Those in authority do not prohibit it. As Chairman Chen said in his inaugural speech: "... Those responsible in all aspects, either because the officials' lives are difficult, or because their subordinates have performed meritorious services in the past, reduce their crimes with consideration for their circumstances..." Over time, it has become a bad atmosphere in politics, and it has long been out of the scope of reducing the difficulty of living, taking this as a means of getting rich. Those who had a hard life in the past are now round-faced wealthy men. This has further motivated those who are still in a hard life to embark on the road of corruption and catch up. Naturally, the wind of corruption cannot be stopped once it starts.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "People must insult themselves before others insult them." At a time when we are seeking national independence and national freedom, it is a great pity that a portion of our officials, who are responsible for saving the country and the people, have engaged in misconduct. However, we cannot but have hope for the officials who are responsible for politics, hoping that they can truly reflect on the past. From now on, they must never again consider reducing crimes and condoning subordinates. From the mistake of "private interests being established and public interests being destroyed" to "public interests being established and private interests being destroyed," and then to establishing the spirit of "forgetting self for the country" and "having the country but not me," it is not too late.</p>
<p>The bad atmosphere in politics is certainly caused by a small number of people. At the same time, a good atmosphere can also be formed by a small number of people. If senior officials strictly practice self-discipline and lead by example, then those below will follow suit, and it will not be difficult to create a good atmosphere. For example, recently, some central organs and the Zhejiang and Anhui provincial governments are gradually moving towards the path of improvement. We hope to make progress every day and expand the scope. The most important thing is the arbitrary county and district politics, because county politics is the most directly related to the people, in order to gradually create a good atmosphere in the entire politics.</p>
<p>Chairman Chen mentioned Mr. Wang's spirit of "forgetting self for the country" and "having the country but not me" at the welcome meeting of the five Shanghai groups the other day, and his eyes were filled with tears. We believe that he was not sad because he was asked to practice this spirit, but sad that too few people can understand and practice this spirit. We should deeply understand Chairman Chen's distress and break through the current corruption in politics with the spirit of "forgetting self for the country."</p>

<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Burmese Deputy Prime Minister, U Saw, issued the following congratulatory statement as the National Government was about to reach the second anniversary of its entry into the war: "More than a year after Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, the National Government resolutely announced its historical decision to join the Greater East Asia War. This war was initiated to end the Sino-Japanese Incident. Therefore, the National Government's decision to share destiny with various countries of Greater East Asia has profound significance. Looking at the process of the National Government declaring war on Britain and the United States, it can be seen as natural for China and Japan to cooperate with each other in the Greater East Asia region, and it is also necessary to permanently break the interference and exploitation of Britain and the United States. Therefore, the National Government's resolute rise on January 9, 1943, was a decision to establish the foundation for East Asian peace and common prosperity. The ancient Chinese sages long advocated peace, and Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, advocated Pan-Asianism, pointing out that China would find it difficult to revitalize itself without mutual understanding and cooperation with Japan. This is unusually clear in the memory of the entire East Asian region. The late Chairman Wang inherited Sun Yat-sen's teachings and immediately made unremitting efforts to realize overall peace. In the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, the National Government clarified the common interests of China and Japan, clearly indicating that China's participation in the war was for the revitalization of the nation and the liberation of East Asia, which is truly admirable.

<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports that a German military spokesperson reviewed the Western Front situation yesterday, stating: "The anti-Axis forces have been forced to withdraw their troops from various war hotspots to counterattack the northern and southern flanks of the German forces entering the region. The current battle has become a war of attrition for the anti-Axis forces, and the enemy has lost several armored divisions and many infantry. The American counterattacks have generally been repelled. The British forces on the northern flank have joined the battle and advanced four or five kilometers. The anti-Axis forces have been forced to withdraw a large number of troops from other areas to attempt a counterattack. The German authorities have seized the opportunity to launch a major counteroffensive in Lorraine and Upper Alsace. In the battles of the past three weeks, the German forces have been in a proactive and free-moving position, making breakthroughs in various areas."</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports that after British forces in the Netherlands reinforced the US First Army to suppress the northern flank of the German invasion zone, two-thirds of the anti-Axis forces on the Western Front are fighting between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers. The US Ninth Army also reinforced the US First Army before the New Year to restore its combat power. The battle in southern Belgium and Luxembourg is reaching its climax. On Friday, enemy forces penetrated at two locations southwest of Marche and Stavelot, while the rest were repelled. On the southern flank, German forces continue to pressure the US Third Army, pushing them back towards Bastogne. General Patton's attempt to relieve the left flank of Bastogne was also unsuccessful. In the major battle between the Saar and the Rhine, German forces are in a proactive position. South of Bich, German forces continue to advance south. The rearguard of the US forces in the Vosges Mountains is being tightly pressed by the German forces and has retreated to Haguenau. After the German forces crossed the Rhine River, the situation there is extremely critical.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Stable Last Week <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai have been relatively stable in the past week, with few changes. Because the year 34 has begun, there was no market for the New Year holidays on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, the prices all tended to rise and become firmer, rising again after a fatigue in the middle. The rise in silver was still rare. Stock transactions were more active than in the past due to the experimental trading of the stock exchange, and the market also saw a gradual increase. However, because short selling was heavy after the start of easy delivery, its speculative danger was greater than that of spot trading. Most ordinary brokers were unwilling to do it, so the exchange authorities attached great importance to it. Whether the transition of the trading prospect can promote the prosperity of the legitimate investment business is unpredictable. Money was slightly looser during the three-day market opening period, with only the interest rate on money shops increasing slightly by six cents. On the industrial and commercial front, there was still a shortage of production, and it was quite difficult for prices to relax. There was no certainty about the resumption of work in factories and companies. Although the market prices of various companies and shops have not seen a further increase, it has been reported that some large manufacturers have repeatedly requested an increase in selling prices, but have not yet been allowed by the authorities. This situation is very worrying. The general public hopes that the relevant economic authorities will carefully consider this with the livelihood of the people as the premise.</p>

<p>With the cooperation of all parties concerned, the Municipal Goods Allocation Office, in order to promote the increase in wartime industrial production in this city under the wartime system, will implement priority allocation for major foods in order to stabilize the daily lives of the relevant workers. All standards and scope of priority allocation have been carefully stipulated. It was found that news workers in this city were not originally included in the priority list. However, Director Feng You of the Allocation Office and Councilor Hirano, believing that news reporters are fighters on the fourth front of the nation and bear the heavy responsibility of reporting, and that their responsibility is even more important during the decisive period of the Greater East Asia War, and that the circumstances of news workers are mostly poor, they should be given priority allocation to stabilize the daily lives of all news reporters in the city. After repeated consultations with all parties concerned, it has been decided to include them in the scope of priority allocation. Once the priority allocation starts in this city, all news reporters in the city will receive the same treatment.</p>

The actual amount of donations received was 150,000 yuan, setting a record for charity table tennis matches. The school donated all the money, which the school authorities allocated to the Shen Xin two newspapers to help students with loans.

Zhou had insufficient experience and declined after being in the lead. Lin, in a calm attitude, defeated Zhou Ruihua 2-1, reversing the defeat and winning the championship. Next was the battle for second place, Zhou Ruihua fought Xiao Weiqing again. The two sides fought fiercely, Zhou defeated Xiao 2-1 and won the runner-up, Xiao ranked third. After the game, Mr. Lin Kanghou of the Presidential Board gave the awards. The six winning female generals each received a silver cup and mirror frame. Then came the He Ren vs. Shanghai United match.

<h3 id="e27">Stabilizing Prices and Stabilizing People's Livelihood <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In today's environment of rampant, ceaseless price increases and widespread misery among the people, making it difficult to survive, the issue that the government authorities should be focusing all their efforts on to resolve is probably no other. In particular, the Shanghai municipal authorities, experiencing this firsthand, should be the first to bear the brunt, witnessing the five million citizens under their jurisdiction, with the exception of a few who profit from the national crisis and the wealthy, mostly groaning and lamenting, living on the edge, and filled with anxiety day in and day out. How could they suddenly forget their responsibilities, remain unmoved, lift them out of the abyss of suffering and bring them to a life of ease? This is not only the ambition that a great statesman should have, but also the responsibility that a great statesman should shoulder. The saying "Do not decline what is righteous" and "Duty-bound with no turning back" can truly be said of the Shanghai municipal authorities.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the incident, prices in Shanghai have been rising, but the rate of increase has only accelerated recently. Normally, a "dan" (a unit of weight) of rice cost around ten yuan, but in January and February of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], the black market price of rice was still just over two thousand yuan per "dan". However, by December of the same year, it had risen to a peak of sixty-five thousand yuan per "shi" (another unit of weight), and even when relatively stable, it was around forty-six or forty-seven thousand yuan. In other words, the price of rice in Shanghai had soared four thousand six or seven hundred times compared to normal, and even within one year, it had skyrocketed more than twenty times. Take coal balls as another example. Normally, a "dan" of 100 "jin" (another unit of weight) would cost only about eight jiao (a unit of currency), but recently a "dan" costs three thousand five hundred yuan. In January and February of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], the black market price of coal balls was still less than two hundred yuan. Although the raw materials and heating power are far from comparable to before, the rate of increase is still more than four thousand four hundred times, and the increase in one year is also more than twenty times. Nothing is more closely related to people's livelihood than "eating," and rice and coal balls are the most important aspects of "the problem of eating." One can wear fewer clothes and live in simpler housing, but one's stomach cannot remain empty. However, with such a sharp rise in prices, the average middle-class family, usually relying on salary income to support a family of eight, is truly suffering from the inability to cope with "the problem of eating." Let's now estimate the monthly expenses for a family, based on recent living conditions, and list them as follows:</p>
<p>The above table lists the minimum cost of living required to maintain a family, according to the recent situation, at more than one hundred thousand yuan. But there are probably very few salary earners whose income can meet this standard, not to mention that even greater difficulties lie ahead, with the situation only worsening. If no measures are taken to curb this trend, not only will the salaried class collapse, but it will also disrupt the social and economic structure, leading to an unmanageable crisis.</p>
<p>Because the rampant rise in prices cannot be contained, people's livelihoods are withering and collapsing in countless ways. Our country has always held the saying "The people are the most important," and also "The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is solid, the state will be secure." And for the Shanghai municipal authorities, stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood is a matter of duty, and it is difficult to stand idly by. Therefore, the author does not hesitate to express his humble opinions, offering them as a modest contribution.</p>
<p>(1) Enhancing Rationing: The daily necessities rationed in Shanghai include rice, flour, grains, coal balls, oil, salt, soap, matches, and so on. It can be said that there is not much lacking in terms of what is needed for people's basic needs of food and clothing. The prices of rationed goods are also very reasonable. The only problem is that the quantity is too small, and often delayed. The authorities' difficulties are certainly not ignored by the citizens, but the citizens' difficulties can only be hoped to be resolved by the authorities, and every effort should be made to overcome all difficulties to achieve results. If all supplies can be rationed on time and in sufficient quantity, then how can the black market prices be rampant, and the lives of citizens can be stabilized.</p>
<p>(2) Unblocking Sources: In order to achieve a smooth and satisfactory rationing system, and to enable people to maintain their minimum standard of living, it is essential to have a flexible transportation mechanism and to unblock the sources of domestic materials. In recent years, there have been many reasons for the soaring prices in Shanghai, but "the inability to smoothly transport goods" is one of the main causes. In order to implement control, the government can coordinate the work, but the results of the previous work done by the authorities have not been satisfactory to the people. At the same time, the prevalence of small traders only promotes the rise in prices. Therefore, from the standpoint of the citizens, it would be best if the government could have a well-planned plan for the transportation of goods and be responsible for it, or else it should allow wealthy merchants and experienced merchants to handle it, and implement supervision and limit profits. If the source of materials can be unblocked, then production can be increased, prices can be stabilized, and the people's lives will be secure.</p>
<p>(3) Suppressing Profiteering: Merchants are inherently profit-seeking. However, during the war, due to the severance of international channels and the interruption of supplies, there were many who took the opportunity to manipulate the national accumulation and make a fortune from the national crisis. On the one hand, most people are oppressed by high prices, struggling and crying out, not knowing where they will die. Such abnormal phenomena not only violate the principle of control, but also destroy the dignity of the law. It can truly be said that "a merchant's success is built on the bones of thousands of people." "Dr. Haber of Germany once gave a lecture in Japan on the reasons for Germany's failure in World War I, and spoke in tears about the situation of merchants becoming rich during the war." It should be known that suppressing profiteering is the government's responsibility, and it should be thoroughly eliminated, especially during wartime. If this point cannot be achieved, not only will prices soar even higher, but most people,困擾by livelihood problems, will not have the heart, the strength, or the ability to unite against aggression and cooperate in the war.</p>
<p>(4) Eliminating Corruption: It is the nature of merchants to seek profit, and if the government is impartial and intervenes, it may be possible to achieve a deterrent effect. What is regrettable is that officials and merchants collude with each other, acting like jackals, which only adds fuel to the fire, making the situation unmanageable. The people's suffering will only deepen, and there is no possibility of reducing it. In recent years, discipline has been lost, orders are not being followed, and the practice of corruption has become a habit. The rice fraud case and the business special tax case, to name a few, are well-known examples. Other smaller cases are too numerous to mention. Due to the collusion between officials and merchants and the prevalence of corruption, the rampant rise in prices is like a raging fire and a flood of water, and the so-called control is actually helping it to rise. Therefore, if you want to stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihood, eliminating corruption is also one of the key points.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the financial center and a major industrial and commercial city of our country. Its economic status is extremely important. In recent years, because it is also the base camp of the wartime system and the source of control policies, its political importance has also become increasingly prominent. Therefore, every move in Shanghai is enough to affect the whole country and spread to various places. It is very appropriate to say that it concerns the views of the whole country. How to make this giant city in East Asia develop its production and restore people's livelihood is not only the responsibility of the municipal authorities, but also the desire of all citizens. At this time, as a new year begins and everything is renewed, the 34th year of the Republic [1945] is coming soon, and the Shanghai municipal authorities are also undergoing a change. I still remember that after Hong Yang was pacified, Zeng Wenzhenggong of Xiangxiang [Zeng Guofan], as the commander-in-chief and governor-general of Liangjiang, was diligent in government and loved the people, and his love was eternally remembered. Now Mr. Zhou and Mr. Luo are also from Hunan. At this time of rampant price increases and people's misery, they have come forward to preside over the Shanghai municipal government and will surely follow the old tradition of Hunan people's perseverance, diligence, and hard work, personally supervise and lead by example, seek happiness for the people, and seek prosperity for Shanghai. I can't help but offer my best wishes and wait with bated breath.</p>
