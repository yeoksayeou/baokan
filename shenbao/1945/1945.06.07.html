<p>東東六日中央社電　冲繩本島南部地區其後繼績激烈交戰，東西兩海岸方面，因日軍反擊熾烈，戰綫無大變化，但中央部之敵軍逐步前進，渡過貫流東西首里南方三四公里之國塲川，接近南岸日軍陣地，日方對之奮勇邀擊，　遏敵軍前進。又日特攻隊賡續冒惡劣氣候，一日以來至三日，對本島附近敵艦船羣加以猛烈攻擊，刻正擴大戰果中。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　冲繩本島南部之日軍守備部隊，運用巧妙作戰及不屈之鬥魂，刻　續勇戰，似上月二十九日夜以來，日軍巳逐漸開始向喜屋武半島方面轉進，完畢新陣地之配備，準備對敵展開迎擊。現敵仍繼續南下，一日下午六時左右，敵之第一綫由佐敷村迄新里·大里·仲問·宮平南方道路，進抵眞寶玉橋綫，一日以來對於喜屋武半島日軍新陣地，於熾烈之艦砲射擊掩護下，更企圖前進，迄三日一部敵軍已有局部前進，現在日美兩軍之接觸綫，由稻嶺·北方迄友寄·長道根差部之綫，敵之行運漸呈緩慢，此後無大變化。</p>
<p>南西基地六日中央社電　冲繩四周之氣候，迄五日尚未恢復，敵輸送船團於此期間，曾作若干行動。又完畢新布陣之日軍陸上部隊，迎擊絕對優勢之敵軍，刻正展開劇戰中。敵於五日晨似在小祿西方海岸調遣步兵四百至五百之新兵力登陸。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地六日中央社電　航空部隊四日夜間製擊先島列島海域敵艦船羣，以魚雷對敵運輸船及艦型不詳者各一艘敢行攻擊。又其他一隊於本島四周擊沉敵運輸船一艘，繼之日軍航空部隊於五日夜間，又對本島四周之敵艦船反覆展開激烈空襲，使敵蒙重大損害。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日陸軍省昨發表　賀谷部隊授獎狀　於此次作戰貢獻甚大 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日陸軍省六日發表，賀谷部隊及該配屬部隊（包括海軍砲隊之一部），於冲繩本島轉戰，樹立偉動，對此，各部隊軍司令官曾授與獎狀，茲者，又奏上聞，頒與獎狀。按賀谷部隊及該配屬部隊，於陸軍中佐賀谷興吉指揮之下，於昭和二十年四月一日邀擊於中城灣西海岸登陸南下之敵軍，且於島袋局邊展開攻防戰以來，轉戰於屋宜原·大城·佛上原各地，戰策巧妙，攻防皆獲其當，奮戰以來，予敵以極大打擊，挫其銳錄。又與西原周邊之友軍部隊共守主要陣地第一綫，於砲隊之緊密協力下，日夜應戰優勢之强敵，而屠敵共四千餘名，破壞敵戰車千輛，於是敵之攻擊卒被擊破。其後，復防禦前田附近，四月二十四日該地展開大攻防戰時，幹部及兵卒之損害爲數雖大，而戰塲到處呈露凹凸錯綜，然仍能善謀勇鬥十數日，傷敵計二萬五千餘名，主要陣地完全在握，其於此後之作戰貢獻甚大。該部隊長指揮有方，部下將兵訓練有素及一體團結所致，其功動洵可嘉獎，特授以獎狀。</p>
<h3 id="c3">美海軍部發表　兩驅艦沉沒　在沖繩作戰失敗 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　美海軍當局，日昨曾就冲繩海域損失艦船依例縮小發表，頃據華盛頓來電稱、美海軍部五日發表謂：美驅逐艦「莫里遜」及「莫森」兩號，最近於冲繩海域巳被擊沉。按該二艦排水量均係二千一百噸，吾人由於美海軍部所發表其沉失時，船員蒙重大損害一語，可推知該艦船員恐巳全數沉沒。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據紐約廣播，美評論家大衛特羅命斯，近撰稿於具有保守色彩之紐約太陽報，指出美軍之冲繩島作戰爲一大失敗，輸文內容略謂：「冲繩島作戰，實可稱爲重大失敗，證明美軍之無能，尤甚於珍珠灣空襲之役。關於該島作戰眞相，可由美軍作戰人數證明，由此數字判斷，更證明此次戰爭，蓋爲我太平洋作戰中最大之失敗，余主張由公平之將校及議員組織一調查會，調查事實眞相」。又美軍事評諭家漢生飽爾文，於本月四日投文紐約泰晤士報，指出「冲繩島戰爭爲苦戰，北種戰爭已啟示聯合軍於侵入日本本土之時，將遭遇如何之境遇，爲進攻日本土關門之冲繩島攻擊，所付代價至鉅，於水陸雨面作戰中，海軍戰死者多於陸軍及陸戰隊，以此次爲　矢」</p>

<p>南方前綫基地六日中央社電　泰拉干島日軍守備部隊，通日連夜擊退敵軍，予敵以甚大損害，現尚死守陣地。野立中尉所指揮之挺身肉搏隊，自上月二十六日迄本月一日前夜，在此一星期間，潸入敵機塲，於敵夜間照明搜索中，全員分別　進目的地，計炸毀冪舍五處，物資集積所二處，炸死敵兵九十五各，此次攻擊，日方亦有本村上等水兵及其他兩名，抱炸藥衝入敵軍幕舍，壯烈戰死。當時隊長以下全體隊員，因携帶食糧不足，曾以草根樹皮果腹，完成重任，其戰志實堪敬佩，此次奇襲，日方除三名壯烈犧牲外，餘均安返原防。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地六日中央社電　泰拉干島之戰况，現雙方於極近距離相互對峙中，敵未行大規模攻擊。日機連日加以猛襲，士氣大振，該島日軍守備隊繼續以肉搏隊强行突擊，炸毀敵陣地及敵宿營地等，收獲甚大戰果，野田技術上尉所指導之突擊隊數名，曾冒敵軍之嚴重警戒律，於本月一日對敵飛機場附近陣地猛烈肉搏奇襲，炸毀敵營幕三所，物資倉庫一處後，全體安返。另一肉搏隊，亦於一日在炸毀敵大型營幕，斃敵四十五名以上，日軍勇敢捐軀，肉搏突擊隊活躍姿態，到處發揮威力。</p>
<p>琉球基地六日中央社電　泰拉干島之敵，因日守備部隊勇猛戰鬥，使其進展之速度備受牽制，而以其熾烈之砲擊焚燒日第一綫陣地後，復逐次企圖向陣地深入作戰，與數日間之轟炸相呼應，五日晨發動攻擊，日方以有力之挺身突擊隊深入敵陣，加以擾亂，同時於化爲墟原之陣前展開引誘激鬥，終將其擊退，而仍堅持主要陣地。所獲戰果，計殺傷敵人員二九一名，　　治擊砲三門，重火器一門，載重卡車三輛，炸毀營幕九處，物資倉應三所，輕機關槍一挺，自動步槍彈藥等多數。</p>

<p>菲島前綫五日中央社電　呂宋島碧瑤方面，三日在碧瑤北面十二公里，有携有山砲十餘門之敵步兵五百人前進，刻與該地日軍對峙中，敵之行動並不積極，但在巴列特東岸基塔塞泰夫附近，日美兩軍仍激戰中。又三賽顏主要公路上之巴克巴日軍守備部隊，攻擊該方面之美菲軍，現尚奮戰中。</p>

<h3 id="c7">渝共關係之新觀察 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>最鈑中日各報，常有關於渝共交惡的消息刊戴，尤其是中共對於重慶在各方面施以抨擊。中共對軍慶攻勢之開展，自以四月下旬中共第七次全黨代表大會爲起點，提出所謂堅持建設聯合政府的主張。在這次大會中，中共代表莫不充滿着傲慢的情緒。反之，重慶國民黨的六全大會（距離中共七全大會不過一星期）對於中共問題，却未有任何顯明的表現，當然，這並不是說重慶國民黨對中共的態度業已變質，同時，這也不是說，重慶國民黨已有組壓中共的把握，所以不聲不響的。我們覺得，重慶對於中共之表示沉默者，無非潛伏着一觸即發的嚴重危機。</p>
<p>中共今日對添攻勢，表現在軍事政治外交經濟文化各方面。特別値得注意的，首先是在軍事方面，據連日本埠日文大陸新報刊載消息，自去年五月日軍河南作戰予重慶第一戰區以重大打擊以後，中共軍賀龍所部之一部分，逐次利用日軍與渝軍之間隙而南下，至今年一月下旬，宣稱所謂華北華中之聯絡完成。</p>
<p>在政治方面，極力向知識份子靑年學生方面展開宣傳及組織工作，而以建設所謂聯合政府遝動爲中心。例如五月十九日昆明婦女大會發表之時局宣言，號召從速召集眞正國民大會·建立舉國一致之聯合政府，都是中共主張的再版而已。此外，五月十四日西南聯大，及其後之浙江大學等，都有同樣的宣言活動。</p>
<p>在中共對渝新攻勢中，特別應該注目的有兩點，已和過去態度不同：</p>
<p>第一，公開宣言反渝反蔣：過去延安一切宣傳，多少還顧全大局，表面上尊重渝蔣，但是現在已開始對重慶國民黨及政府直接詆毀。</p>
<p>第二，公然指摘英美，並反對列强在中國大陸作戰！在不久以前，中共尚發表所謂「配合盟軍登陸作戰」的口號，但是，這次毛澤東竟在七全大會上宣稱：「重慶國民黨政府借用美國力量，於擊退日本後，將和英國在希臘一樣殺　我同胞一，新四軍的政委劉少奇也說：「美國目前　　國共合作，在强化對日作戰，我們要以　　　　，觀察美國意圖，我們決不爲美國的　　　　，這裏已充分表露中共放棄媚美態度，並指美國有侵略中國及破壞中國民族統一的傾向。</p>
<p>中共這種態度，很明顯的，是最近英美蘇聯矛盾衝突在中國的反映。觀乎日前報載蘇聯使節及專家之遄赴延安一訊，更可證明今日渝共問題之複雜性和嚴重性已至何種程度。我們在此危急之秋，一方面不得不向重慶作最後的警告，放棄無謂拖戰，完成全面和平。另一方而尤盼望中日當局能從遠處着想，迅以最大誠意，解救今日和平區內一切困難問題，保持人民元氣。</p>

<h3 id="c8">黃浦江畔 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 志澄</p>
<p>急盼農貸－杜家行</p>
<p>杜家行本一無足輕重之小鎭，距浦江畔一里許，事變後商業衰落，但爲奉賢一帶米糧北運必經之處，遂成爲一大米市塲，每日自晨至暮，熙來攘往，頗形熱閙，販戶均來此買米運至邵樓，周浦等地，亦有渡江而至上海市者。鄉民最大痛苦，厥爲　關林立，捐稅太繁，部隊之多，不勝計數，農民辛苦所得，大部份消耗於此。至於農貸前曾一度辦理，但由鄉鎭長轉手，晨民直接所得，已剩無幾，最近適値農忙期內，一般佃戶需款甚殷，高利貸不敢領教，農村貸金，翹首盼望，亟望當局對於農貸積極推動，以達增產目的。</p>
<p>市面平常－邵樓鎭</p>
<p>邵樓鎭位於杜家行及周浦之中點，交通不便，僅有脚划船往來其間，每日一次。因機關不多，人民負担較輕，但富有之家，仍不敢逗留鎭上，故可稱江畔冷靜之一隅，市面平常，雜糧店最多。郊外頗多空屋，大都均　富戶所居者。物價較廉，日用品略貴。</p>
<p>煩惱重重－周浦</p>
<p>最大煩惱即爲捐款，目前周浦水陸交通便利，鎭上屬保安隊及中警團之區域，郊外尚有新四軍，忠救軍及其他部隊之活動，故人們負擔極重，有須向五方面繳納者。各項捐稅及地方辦公費均由商民公　，上屆方面先由各公會按比例分配，侮公會應付成數，再由各該公會徇各會員店徵收之，其多少依每店之歷史，範圍而定。例如今春新四軍會徇當地徵捐米一千五百石，依侮擔十萬元計，即需一萬五千萬元。某醬園　戰前創設，範圍較大，資本雄原，此次攤派，須捐入十餘萬元，今年迄目前爲止，其屢次所捐款項，總計三四百萬元左有。區區一店，巳屬如此，則全鎭所捐之款，更可觀矣。其捐款由鄉鎭長，轉　授於各部隊之手，彼華在其中提取者敢扣投，故每任鎭長，接任二三月後，已面團團如富家　　。若捐款不能付出，唯一辦法爲停止營業。</p>
<p>其次即局房屋之租賃費了，其費用之大，耳所來聞，警通一上一下店面，每月米一石五斗，較大者一石七斗，熊目前米價計核，單房金一項，就得數十萬元。最近銀錢業貼現之風頗盛，定每十日爲一期信用素著者，拆息每元一角二三分，否則竟有一角半至二角者，其月息即四角半至六角，如此高利，駭人聽開，且所借之款，無抵押品，而先扣利息。設某甲以期息一角辦，將一百萬元貸與乙銀行，先扣利息十五萬元，一方淨得八十五萬元，用以在外埠囤積或投機，二月後連本加利，共須還二百萬元。若一且投機失敗，至期不還，或拒不見面，或逃之夭夭；近來如此情形而相奉倒閉者，已有五六家，數目極鉅，據聞端午節前尚有五六家，此眞可爲一般「高利貸」之一大教訓。</p>
<p>浦東之慈善團體，以周浦之轉化慈與會爲最大，設於光緒二十八年，會務本由董事會總攬一切。惟事變後董事大都避居海上，故實際負責者爲董事會下之總監及副監二人，其下復分學務殿務施濟三部，各設主任一人。所辦善舉有義學，施藥，施診，恤　，賒棺，施米，平　，施衣及春眼九種，前五種係全年舉辦，施衣施米則於冬季舉辦，義學即設在會內，現有教員二人，學生一百五十四名，爲一完全小學，所授課目略與一般小學不同，蓋全以培植貧苦子弟之不能升學，出校後即須習職業者而設，故功課均求實用。恤　則額定二百五十名，但須合於規定之條件，經審查合格後方得按月發給盒米六斤，歲末則倍之。賒棺一項，因目下本材飛漲，成本巨大，定收回成本一部份一萬五千元，赤　者免。木年春賑已辦過，共發出米數百石。聞該會並無基金，祇因歷來信用素著，故前往捐輸者甚踴躍，且每次舉辦善事，往往臨時才由各會員從事向外界捐募，如有不足，則由該會各董事及負責人設法彌補，該會善於救濟，對地方公益可稱功德無量。</p>
<p>刦後餘生－楊思橋</p>

<p>東京六日中央社電　渝國民黨第六届一巾全會，於三十一日第三次大會席上所決定之行政院正副院長更易事項，乃去年已一月斯蒂維爾事件後，渝方大改組之重要事件。按渝方此次之改組，對外與舊金山會議，對內則與本年秋季實施憲政問題互有關聯，而宋子文之就任行政院長，乃根據以經濟援渝爲招牌之美國要求。宋氏現出席舊金山會議，乃渝方之美國代言者，且係渝財界最高首領，蓋欲打開目下至重大經濟難關，除候美國援助外，別無良策故也。而欲圓滿接受美國之經濟援助，則以美國買辦之宋子文爲最適當，且納爾遜抵渝以來，渝方即以翁文　創設戰時生產局，表明與美國協力，此純係根據美對渝政策，以此等美渝經濟合作之重要人物，充任行政院副院長，可知渝方已積極加强依賴美國。總之，美渝合作已超過政治合作階段，而進展至處理事務階段，換言之，亦即美渝合作現已完全步入正軌。宋子文於過去五閱月間，事實上已任行政院長，此乃故美總統羅斯福之希望，然宋氏乃爲自己利益而不惜賣國之利己分子，此實乃中國之危險人物也，此種危險心，爲羅斯福所促成，二欲活用於實現其野心，今蔣介石雖辭去行政院長職，但仍保持其「國家領袖」及「渝方軍事最高長官」之地位與權威，並不因辭去行政院長而被院內各部畏之發言所拘束，於處理國內問題時，却重增大其行動之自由。同時，因政府最高陣容維持常熊，可知現正漸次推進憲政準備。孔祥熙當去年十一</p>
<p>公務員卹金再增加廿倍業經行政院會議通過</p>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　銓叙部以近來物價上漲，原有公務員各種恤金，雖已於上年七月間增加三倍，但爲數仍極微薄。以之應付棺殮等費，尚覺不敷，邊論撫恤遺族，且一般公務員生前均無積蓄，一且死亡，身後旣極蕭條遺族頓失瞻養，爰特呈請行政院，將公務員各種卹金予以提高，以示政府體卹之至意，茲經行政院第二五四次會議通過，按此次增加數目，依照卹金數目，一律再增加二十倍。月渝府改組時，國內，國外，尤其延安指爲第一名貪官汚吏，故其去任乃屬必然，孔氏此次去職後，對於國內予以甚大滿足。</p>

<p>東京六日中央社電　據每日新聞瑞典京城特電稱，特魯曼前曾於議會席上表明，決實施對日四大戰略·使日本無條件降伏，但美國對日攻擊轟炸與以前對德作戰情勢不同，一般專門家大都評論其中有甚多障碍，如倫敦泰晤士報航空記者謂，美對日攻擊轟炸戰略中，最感困難者，乃在接近日本本土，各接近地域中，並無對德作戰時具有大航空母艦使命之空軍基地，並謂，菲島面積雖與英本土大小相似，然距離及地形各點，均不相同。美國自獲得馬里亞納基地以來，以B29型機強行對日實施戰略作戰，現正計劃自沖繩大航空基地，繼續發動激烈強襲。據泰晤士報記者稱，此外尚有不可推測之點甚多，故今後對日戰略攻擊如何展開，現尚極難預測，常視今後由冲繩作戰及其他獲得新基地作戰之推移如何而決定，敵之戰略轟炸機水陸部隊漸次活躍，然無論何時，英·美聯合軍方面，必須充分覺悟預備犧牲大量之艦船及空軍兵員。又特魯曼指摘謂，日木空軍尚極强大，航空機，戰鬥機之生產亦甚多，切不可輕視，且英國方面亦具同一意見。</p>
<p>美雜誌論作戰困難</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據紐約來電，美國時代週刊以戰鬥之前途爲題，論述如次：吾人對日作戰，必須集中艦船，飛機，戰車，載重汽車，火箭彈，炸彈等之全力，然此於美國及聯合國曾決非易事。集中全戰力對日本作戰之前，吾人必須將歐洲軍隊與資材移於太平洋戰域，而較此更爲困難者，當爲獲得此等軍隊與資材之適當基地，但距日本本土二千一百六十餘公里，而戰域中之水域太多，北自千烏，南達爪哇，更自加羅林羣島擴充至中國巾部，且泰，越，馬來。荷屬東印度形成單一世界，吾人必須與之展開戰鬥。太平洋戰爭最大之困難，須由美國負担，英國大部艦隊業開抵太平洋，並還輸軍隊，加拿大亦稱運送義勇軍，而澳洲軍於所羅門羣島，新幾內亞，婆羅洲等竭力戰爭。荷蘭於此次戰爭，不能有甚大之貢獻，荷蘭之海軍，三年前因受日軍痛擊，今法國對越南極爲關心，僅以小機動部隊開往太平洋。重慶政權自一九三七年以來，　續戰爭迄至現在，陸軍與軍需產業尚屬貧弱，僅能維持其領土，由此而觀，美國在太平洋戰域，必須單獨戰鬥，故吾人不得不發動最大之海軍，空軍以及七百萬兵員，完成對日作戰。</p>

<p>陳彬　詞</p>
<p>「島田中佐最近來氾，擔任陸軍部報道部長，我們新聞界同人今天舉行茶會，表示歡迎　忱。</p>
<p>我們和島田中佐雖是初交，可是，我們和陸軍報道部的關係却非常密切，因爲陸軍報道部是我們的指道機關，過去上海新聞界受到陸軍報道部的指導協助之處很多，歷任部長也都能推誠相與，必能繼續給予我們更熱心的指導，更切實的協助。</p>
<p>我們屢次說過，上海是一個謠言最多的地方，而也是最易引起一般人輕信謠言的地方，所以我們擔任報道宣傳工作者，特別感覺責任重大。因爲謠言的製造者，大半由於敵方的謀略作用，我們應該怎樣隨時報道正確的時事，怎樣隨時解剖時局的動向，一方面指示市民認識時局眞相，一方面粉碎敵人謀略造謠，實在是極艱鉅的工作。而怎樣推動並完成這工作，就需要我們新聞界團結一致，在報道當局的指導之下，齊一步伐共同努力。今天本人代表新聞界同人，以至誠表示歡迎，同時申述本位工作的旨趣，盼望島田中佐指教。」</p>
<p>島田答詞</p>
<p>島田部長答詞，略謂：「本人奉命來滬，担任報道工作，已於前日到任。現在戰局日趨嚴重，担任宣傳工作者之責任，亦日益加重。尤其是以上海爲中心的報道工作，益爲重要。不僅在東亞方面，即在全世界，將來宣傳效果最大者，乃爲上海。誠如剛才陳彬龢先生說敵方對上海實行謀略宣傳，我們的對付方法，應由中日關係雙方一致團結，將敵方謀略宣傳，加以粉碎。剛才復承陳先生謬贊，本人愧不敢當。但本人過去曾數度來滬，對氾上新聞界人士亦頗多相識，今後在各方面推進工作時，尚希多多指教。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Southern Okinawa Kiyan Cape: Japanese Army Completes New Deployment, Air Force Continues Fierce Attacks on Enemy Ships <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tung Tung, 6th: Intense fighting continues in the southern part of Okinawa Island. On both the eastern and western coasts, the battle lines have not changed significantly due to fierce Japanese counterattacks. However, in the central region, enemy forces are gradually advancing, crossing the Kokuba River, which flows east-west three or four kilometers south of Shuri, and approaching the Japanese army's southern defensive positions. The Japanese forces are fighting valiantly to intercept and halt the enemy's advance. Furthermore, Japanese special attack units continue to brave adverse weather conditions, launching fierce attacks on enemy fleets near the island from the 1st to the 3rd, and are currently expanding their successes.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Japanese garrison forces in southern Okinawa Island are utilizing skillful tactics and an indomitable fighting spirit, continuing to fight bravely. It appears that since the night of the 29th of last month, the Japanese army has gradually begun to withdraw towards the Kiyan Cape area, completing the deployment of new defensive positions, and preparing to launch a counterattack against the enemy. Currently, the enemy continues to advance southward. Around 6:00 PM on the 1st, the enemy's front line advanced from the road south of Sashiki Village to the Shinazato, Osato, Nakama, and Miyahira road, reaching the Shinpo Bridge line. Since the 1st, under the intense cover of naval artillery fire, they have attempted to advance further towards the Japanese army's new positions on the Kiyan Cape. By the 3rd, a portion of the enemy forces had made some local advances. Currently, the contact line between the Japanese and American forces extends from the Inamine area in the north to the Tomoyose and Nagamine Nezasu areas. The enemy's progress has gradually slowed, and there have been no major changes since.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nansei Base, 6th: The weather around Okinawa has not yet recovered as of the 5th. During this period, enemy transport convoys have made some movements. The Japanese army's ground forces, having completed their new deployment, are engaging in fierce battles against the overwhelming enemy forces. On the morning of the 5th, the enemy appears to have landed 400 to 500 new infantry reinforcements on the western coast of Oroku.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Ryukyu Islands Base, 6th: On the night of the 4th, air force units attacked enemy fleets in the Sakishima Islands sea area, daringly attacking one enemy transport ship and one vessel of unknown type with torpedoes. Another unit sank one enemy transport ship around the main island. Subsequently, Japanese air force units repeatedly launched fierce air raids on enemy ships around the main island on the night of the 5th, inflicting significant damage on the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Army Ministry Announced Yesterday: Kogatani Unit Awarded Citation for Great Contribution to Current Operations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Army Ministry announced on the 6th that the Kogatani Unit and its affiliated units (including a portion of the naval artillery unit) have established great feats in the battles on Okinawa Island. The commanders of each unit awarded citations. Furthermore, it was reported to the Emperor and citations were bestowed. The Kogatani Unit and its affiliated units, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Kogani Kokichi, intercepted enemy forces landing and advancing southward on the west coast of Nakagusuku Bay on April 1, Showa 20 (1945). Since engaging in offensive and defensive battles around the Isahuku District, they have fought in various locations such as Yaibaru, Osato, and Bukkami Haru. Their tactical skills in both offense and defense were appropriate, and they have inflicted great damage on the enemy, blunting their advance. They also defended the front line of the main defensive position together with friendly units around Nishihara, and with close cooperation from the artillery unit, they fought day and night against superior enemy forces, killing over 4,000 enemy soldiers and destroying 1,000 enemy tanks. As a result, the enemy's attack was ultimately repelled. Afterwards, while defending the vicinity of Maeda, when a major offensive and defensive battle unfolded there on April 24th, although the casualties among officers and soldiers were significant and the battlefield was rough and rugged, they were still able to strategize and fight bravely for more than ten days, injuring more than 25,000 enemy soldiers. The main defensive position was completely secured, and their contribution to subsequent operations was significant. The achievements are commendable, due to the unit commander's effective leadership, the well-trained soldiers, and their unified solidarity. Therefore, a citation is awarded.</p>
<h3 id="e3">US Navy Department Announces: Two Destroyers Sunk, Operations in Okinawa Failed <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 6th: The US Navy authorities have been routinely downplaying the losses of warships in the Okinawa waters. According to a dispatch from Washington, the US Navy Department announced on the 5th that the US destroyers "Morrison" and "Massen" were recently sunk in the Okinawa sea area. Both ships have a displacement of 2,100 tons. Based on the US Navy Department's statement that the crews suffered significant damage during their sinking, it can be inferred that the crew members have likely all perished.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: According to a New York broadcast, American commentator David Troman has recently written an article in the conservative New York Sun, pointing out that the US military's Okinawa operation was a major failure. The article stated: "The Okinawa operation can truly be called a major failure, proving the incompetence of the US military, even more so than the Pearl Harbor air raid. The truth about the island operation can be proven by the number of US troops involved. Judging by this figure, it further proves that this war is the greatest failure in our Pacific operations. I propose that a commission composed of impartial officers and congressmen be organized to investigate the truth of the matter." Furthermore, American military commentator Hansen Baldwin, in an article published in the New York Times on the 4th of this month, pointed out that "The Okinawa war was a bitter battle. The northern war has revealed to the Allied forces what kind of situation they will encounter when invading the Japanese mainland. The cost of attacking Okinawa, the gateway to the invasion of the Japanese mainland, was enormous. In the amphibious operations, the navy suffered more casualties than the army and marines, and this is unprecedented."</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Troops Fight Fiercely in Tarakan, Still Holding Main Positions, Suicide Squads Launch Surprise Attack on Enemy Airfield <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Southern Front Base, 6th: The Japanese garrison forces on Tarakan Island have repelled enemy forces day and night, inflicting significant damage on the enemy, and are still holding their positions. The suicide squad led by Lieutenant Nodachi, from the 26th of last month until the eve of the 1st of this month, infiltrated the enemy airfield. Under the enemy's night-time illumination and searchlights, all members separately advanced to their destinations, destroying five enemy barracks and two material stockpiles, killing ninety-five enemy soldiers. During this attack, Seaman Kamimura and two others from the Japanese side bravely charged into the enemy barracks with explosives and died a glorious death. At the time, the entire squad, including the commander, completed their mission on empty stomachs with grass roots and tree bark, for lack of sufficient food. Their fighting spirit is truly admirable. In this surprise attack, all but three of the Japanese, who died bravely, returned safely to their original defenses.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Southwest Pacific Base, 6th: In the battle situation on Tarakan Island, both sides are currently confronting each other at extremely close range. The enemy has not launched a large-scale attack. Japanese aircraft have launched fierce attacks daily, greatly boosting morale. The Japanese army garrison on the island continues to carry out strong suicide attacks, destroying enemy positions and enemy encampments, achieving significant battle results. A group of assault troops led by Technical Lieutenant Noda braved the enemy's severe vigilance and launched a fierce suicide raid on enemy positions near the airfield on the 1st of this month, destroying three enemy barracks and one material warehouse before returning safely. Another suicide squad also destroyed a large enemy barracks on the 1st, killing over 45 enemy soldiers. Japanese soldiers bravely sacrificed themselves, and the active performance of suicide assault squads is demonstrating their power everywhere.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Ryukyu Base, 6th: On Tarakan Island, the enemy's advance speed is being severely hampered by the fierce fighting of the Japanese garrison. After burning the Japanese front-line positions with their intense artillery fire, they gradually attempted to penetrate deeper into the positions, echoing the bombings of the past few days. On the morning of the 5th, they launched an attack. The Japanese forces sent powerful suicide attack squads deep into enemy lines to disrupt them, and at the same time engaged in luring and fierce fighting in front of the ruined positions, finally repelling them and still holding the main positions. The battle results included killing or wounding 291 enemy personnel, destroying three field guns, one heavy weapon, three cargo trucks, nine barracks, three material warehouses, one light machine gun, and a large quantity of automatic rifle ammunition.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Fierce Fighting Continues in Various Locations in Luzon <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Philippine Front, 5th: In the Baguio area of Luzon Island, 500 enemy infantrymen carrying more than ten mountain guns advanced 12 kilometers north of Baguio on the 3rd, and are currently facing off against Japanese forces in the area. The enemy's actions are not aggressive, but fierce fighting continues between Japanese and American forces near Kitaseiteff on the east coast of Barret. In addition, the Japanese garrison forces in Bakba on the main highway of San Saiyan are attacking the American and Filipino forces in the area and are still fighting bravely.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th: In order to strengthen public security in the urban area and prevent bandits from infiltrating the city, the Provincial Police Department has specially established two pistol squads, stationed at the boundaries of the urban and suburban areas. The members of the pistol squad are selected from special agents and police officers, all equipped with new-style special weapons, possessing substantial strength. After the team was established on the 1st, they were immediately dispatched to serve.</p>

<h3 id="e7">A New Observation of the Chongqing-Communist Relationship <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese newspapers have frequently carried news about the worsening relations between Chongqing and the Communists, especially the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) criticisms of Chongqing in various aspects. The CCP's offensive against Chongqing started with the CCP's Seventh National Congress in late April, proposing the so-called advocacy of building a coalition government. In this congress, the CCP representatives were filled with arrogance. In contrast, the Chongqing Kuomintang's Sixth National Congress (only one week away from the CCP's Seventh National Congress) did not have any clear expressions on the CCP issue. Of course, this does not mean that the Chongqing Kuomintang's attitude towards the CCP has changed, nor does it mean that the Chongqing Kuomintang is confident in suppressing the CCP, so they remain silent. We feel that Chongqing's silence towards the CCP implies a serious crisis that could erupt at any moment.</p>
<p>The CCP's offensive against Chongqing today is manifested in military, political, diplomatic, economic, and cultural aspects. Particularly noteworthy is the military aspect. According to news published in the Japanese-language Continental New Daily News in Japan, since the Japanese army's operation in Henan last May inflicted a major blow on Chongqing's First War Zone, part of the CCP army under the command of He Long has gradually used the gap between the Japanese army and the Chongqing army to move south. By late January of this year, they declared the so-called completion of the connection between North and Central China.</p>
<p>In the political aspect, they are working hard to carry out propaganda and organization work among intellectuals, youths, and students, focusing on the so-called coalition government movement. For example, the declaration on the current situation issued by the Kunming Women's Congress on May 19, calling for the speedy convocation of a genuine National Assembly and the establishment of a coalition government of national unity, are merely re-editions of the CCP's advocacy. In addition, Southwest Associated University on May 14 and Zhejiang University, among others, had similar declaration activities.</p>
<p>In the CCP's new offensive against Chongqing, two points are particularly noteworthy, which are different from the past attitude:</p>
<p>First, openly declaring opposition to Chongqing and Chiang: In the past, all propaganda in Yan'an still took the overall situation into consideration to some extent, and nominally respected Chongqing and Chiang, but now it has begun to directly slander the Chongqing Kuomintang and the government.</p>
<p>Second, openly criticizing Britain and the United States, and opposing the great powers' operations on the Chinese mainland! Not long ago, the CCP issued the slogan of "cooperating with the Allied forces in landing operations," but this time Mao Zedong declared at the Seventh National Congress: "The Chongqing Kuomintang government is borrowing the power of the United States, and after repelling Japan, will kill our compatriots like Britain in Greece." Liu Shaoqi, the political commissar of the New Fourth Army, also said: "The United States is currently supporting the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation to strengthen the war against Japan. We must be very cautious and observe the intentions of the United States. We will never be used by the United States." This fully reveals the CCP's abandonment of its pro-American attitude and indicates that the United States has a tendency to invade China and undermine Chinese national unity.</p>
<p>This attitude of the CCP is clearly a reflection of the recent contradictions and conflicts between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in China. The news that Soviet envoys and experts have rushed to Yan'an further proves the complexity and seriousness of the Chongqing-Communist problem today. In this time of crisis, on the one hand, we must make a final warning to Chongqing, abandon meaningless procrastination, and complete comprehensive peace. On the other hand, we especially hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities can think far ahead and quickly resolve all difficult problems in the peaceful areas today with the utmost sincerity to maintain the people's vitality.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Along the Huangpu River <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Zhicheng</p>
<p>Urgently Awaiting Agricultural Loans – Dujia Village</p>
<p>Dujia Village was originally an insignificant small town, about one mile away from the Huangpu River. After the Incident, commerce declined, but it became a major rice market because it was the only way for rice from Fengxian and surrounding area to transport to the north. From morning till dusk every day, it is very bustling and lively. The merchants come here to buy rice and transport it to Shaolou, Zhoupu and other places. Some also cross the river to Shanghai. The greatest pain of the villagers is the numerous barriers and excessive taxes. The large number of troops is countless, and most of the hard-earned income of farmers is consumed here. As for the agricultural loans, it was once handled, but after being transferred by the township head, the money directly received by the farmers was very little. Recently, during the busy farming season, the general tenants are in great need of money. They dare not learn from the high interest loans. The rural loans are eagerly awaited. It is hoped that the authorities will actively promote agricultural loans to achieve the goal of increasing production.</p>
<p>Market is Average – Shaolou Town</p>
<p>Shaolou Town is located in the middle of Dujia Village and Zhoupu, and the transportation is inconvenient. There are only rowing boats going back and forth once a day. Because there are not many institutions, the people's burden is relatively light, but wealthy families still dare not stay in the town, so it can be called a calm corner of the Jiangpan. The market is average, and there are the most grocery stores. There are many empty houses in the suburbs, most of which are inhabited by wealthy households. Prices are cheaper, and daily necessities are slightly more expensive.</p>
<p>Full of Worries – Zhoupu</p>
<p>The biggest worry is donations. At present, Zhoupu has convenient water and land transportation. The town belongs to the area of the security team and the Central Police Corps. In the suburbs, there are activities of the New Fourth Army, the Loyalty and Salvation Army and other troops, so people are heavily burdened. Some have to pay to five parties. Various donations and local office expenses are all borne by the merchants. In the previous session, the proportions were first distributed by the various guilds, and then the guilds collected the corresponding amount from each member shop, according to the history and scope of each shop. For example, this spring, the New Fourth Army requested a donation of 1,500 stones of rice, which is 150 million yuan based on 100,000 yuan per burden. A certain soy sauce garden was established before the war, and its scope is relatively large with abundant capital. This time, it needs to donate more than 100,000 yuan. So far this year, the total amount of donations made has been 3-4 million yuan. Even one store is like this, so the amount donated by the entire town can be seen. The donations are transferred from the township head to the hands of various troops. Those who extract them dare to deduct them, so every new township head looks like a wealthy man after taking office for two or three months. If the donation cannot be paid, the only way is to stop business.</p>
<p>The second is the rental fee for the Bureau of Housing. The cost is so high that it is widely heard. The upper and lower shops of the police station cost 1.5 bushels of rice per month, and the larger ones cost 1.7 bushels of rice. According to the current rice price, the single room rent costs hundreds of thousands of yuan. Recently, the trend of discounting in the silver and money industry is very popular. The interest rate for those with good credit is 12-13 cents per yuan every ten days, otherwise it is 15-20 cents, which is 45-60 cents per month. Such high interest is shocking to hear, and the borrowed money has no collateral, and the interest is deducted first. Suppose someone borrows 1 million yuan from Bank B at an interest rate of 10 cents, Bank B first deducts 150,000 yuan of interest, so he only gets 850,000 yuan to hoard or speculate in other places. After two months, including principal and interest, a total of 2 million yuan must be repaid. If the speculation fails and the money is not repaid on time, or they refuse to meet, or run away. Recently, there have been five or six bankruptcies due to such situations, and the numbers are huge. It is said that there are still five or six bankruptcies before the Dragon Boat Festival. This can be a big lesson for the general "loan sharks."</p>
<p>Among the charitable organizations in Pudong, the Zhuanhua Charity Association in Zhoupu is the largest. It was established in the 28th year of Guangxu. The association's affairs were originally handled by the board of directors. However, after the Incident, most of the directors took refuge at sea, so the actual persons in charge were the director-general and deputy director-general under the board of directors. Under them are divided into three departments: academic affairs, temple affairs, and relief, each with a director. The charitable deeds undertaken include charity schools, medicine distribution, medical consultation, relief, coffin loans, rice distribution, ping-ji, clothing distribution, and spring blindness, nine kinds. The first five are held throughout the year, and clothing and rice distribution are held in winter. The charity school is located in the association, and there are two teachers and 154 students, which is a complete elementary school. The subjects taught are slightly different from ordinary elementary schools. Generally, they are designed to cultivate poor children who cannot go to school and need to learn a profession after leaving school, so the homework is practical. The relief is fixed at 250 people, but must meet the prescribed conditions, and after passing the examination, they can receive 6 kg of boxed rice per month, which is doubled at the end of the year. For the coffin loan, the cost is huge due to the soaring cost of timber. A part of the cost of 15,000 yuan is charged back, and the poor are exempted. The spring relief was already completed this year, and hundreds of stones of rice were distributed. It is said that the association has no funds, but because of its long-standing reputation, people are very enthusiastic about donating, and each time a charity event is held, members often temporarily engage in raising donations from the outside world. If there is not enough, the directors and persons in charge of the association will find ways to make up for it. The association is good at relief, and its merits are immeasurable for local public welfare.</p>
<p>Survival After a Robbery – Yangsi Bridge</p>
<p>Before February, around 10 o'clock every night, it was the time for local bandits to be active, robbing every household without exception. The targets, in addition to cash and jewelry, were materials such as rice, cotton, oil, and wheat. Therefore, the residents all screamed to the sky and moved out together. Recently, after Japanese troops were stationed in the town, it began to be peaceful, but the market is deserted and has become a small village. There is no news of guerrilla teams collecting donations, and the general prices are the same as in Shanghai, or even higher. Since the opening of the Shangnan Road, this place has also become a branch station, so the market is gradually recovering.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Inside Story of Chongqing Appointing Song Ziwen as President of the Executive Yuan <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The change of the President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, decided at the third meeting of the Sixth National Congress of the Chongqing Kuomintang on the 31st, was an important event in Chongqing's major reorganization after the Stilwell incident in January last year. This reorganization in Chongqing is related to the San Francisco Conference externally, and to the implementation of constitutional government this autumn internally. Song Ziwen's appointment as President of the Executive Yuan is based on the demands of the United States, using economic assistance to Chongqing as a sign. Song is currently attending the San Francisco Conference and is Chongqing's American spokesperson and the highest leader of Chongqing's financial community. To overcome the current serious economic difficulties, there is no better plan than waiting for American assistance. To smoothly accept American economic assistance, it is most appropriate to have Song Ziwen, an American comprador, and since Nelson's arrival in Chongqing, Chongqing has established a wartime production bureau with Weng Wenhao, indicating cooperation with the United States. This is purely based on the US policy towards Chongqing. With such important figures of US-Chongqing economic cooperation serving as Vice Presidents of the Executive Yuan, it can be seen that Chongqing has actively strengthened its reliance on the United States. In short, US-Chongqing cooperation has gone beyond the stage of political cooperation and progressed to the stage of handling affairs. In other words, US-Chongqing cooperation has now fully entered the right track. Song Ziwen has actually served as President of the Executive Yuan in the past five months, which was the hope of the late US President Roosevelt. However, Song is a selfish element who would sell his country for his own benefit, and this is a dangerous figure in China. This kind of danger was encouraged by Roosevelt, who wanted to use him to realize his ambitions. Now, although Chiang Kai-shek has resigned from the post of President of the Executive Yuan, he still maintains his position and authority as "national leader" and "highest military commander of Chongqing," and is not bound by the fear of the voices of the various departments in the Executive Yuan after resigning from the post of President of the Executive Yuan. When dealing with domestic problems, he has greatly increased his freedom of action. At the same time, because the highest government lineup maintains Changxiong, it can be seen that the preparation for constitutional government is gradually being promoted. Kong Xiangxi was regarded as the number one corrupt official by the domestic and foreign media, especially Yan'an, when the Chongqing government was reorganized last November. Therefore, his resignation was inevitable, and his departure this time greatly satisfied the country.</p>
<p>Twenty Times Increase in Civil Servant Pensions Passed by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th: The Ministry of Personnel believes that prices have risen recently, and although the original civil servant pensions have been increased threefold in July of last year, the amount is still very small. It is still insufficient to pay for coffin and funeral expenses, let alone to provide for the bereaved. Moreover, civil servants generally have no savings during their lifetime. Once they die, they are extremely desolate and their families lose their support. Therefore, the Ministry of Personnel specially requested the Executive Yuan to increase the various civil servant pensions to show the government's sincere care. The request was passed by the 254th meeting of the Executive Yuan. According to the number of pensions, the number will be increased by twenty times.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Truman Admits: The Japanese Air Force is Strong, American Attacks and Bombing Face Many Obstacles <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a special dispatch from the Mainichi Shimbun in Stockholm, Truman previously stated in Congress that he was determined to implement the four major strategies against Japan to force Japan's unconditional surrender. However, the situation for American attacks and bombing against Japan is different from the previous war against Germany. Most experts comment that there are many obstacles. For example, the aviation reporter of the London Times said that the most difficult aspect of the American strategy of attacking and bombing Japan is approaching the Japanese mainland. Among the accessible areas, there are no air bases that have the mission of large aircraft carriers as during the war against Germany. He also said that although the area of the Philippines is similar to that of the British mainland, the distance and terrain are different. Since acquiring the Mariana Islands as a base, the United States has been forcibly implementing strategic operations against Japan with B-29 aircraft, and is now planning to launch fierce attacks from the large air base in Okinawa. According to the Times reporter, there are many unpredictable points, so it is extremely difficult to predict how the strategic attacks against Japan will unfold in the future. It depends on how operations proceed from Okinawa and the acquisition of new bases. Enemy strategic bombers and amphibious units are gradually becoming active, but at any time, the British and American allied forces must be fully aware and prepared to sacrifice a large number of ships and air force personnel. Truman also pointed out that the Japanese air force is still extremely powerful, and the production of aircraft and fighter planes is also very high, which should not be underestimated, and the British side also holds the same view.</p>
<p>American Magazine Discusses the Difficulty of Operations</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New York, the American magazine Time, in an article titled "The Future of Combat," stated the following: "We must concentrate all our ships, aircraft, tanks, trucks, rockets, and bombs in our operations against Japan, but this is by no means an easy task for the United States and the United Nations. Before concentrating all combat power against Japan, we must transfer European troops and materials to the Pacific theater. What is more difficult is obtaining suitable bases for these troops and materials. The distance to the Japanese mainland is more than 2,160 kilometers, and there is too much water in the war zone, from the Kuril Islands in the north to Java in the south, and extending from the Caroline Islands to central China. Furthermore, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies form a single world, and we must engage in combat with them. The greatest difficulty in the Pacific War must be borne by the United States. A large part of the British fleet has already arrived in the Pacific and is also transporting troops. Canada also claims to be transporting volunteers, while the Australian army is fighting hard in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Borneo. The Netherlands cannot make a significant contribution to this war. The Dutch navy was severely defeated by the Japanese army three years ago. Today, France is very concerned about Vietnam and is only sending small mobile units to the Pacific. The Chongqing government has been continuously fighting since 1937, and its army and military industry are still weak, only able to maintain its territory. From this perspective, the United States must fight alone in the Pacific theater, so we must launch the largest navy, air force, and seven million troops to complete the operation against Japan."</p>

<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - Washington dispatch: U.S. President Truman sent a special message to Congress on the 1st, explaining the U.S. strategy against Japan.

<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Moscow Radio's broadcast yesterday: The four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France have signed a "Joint Agreement," and the four countries will henceforth hold all power over Germany. Currently, the border of Germany should retreat to where the German border was on December 31, 1937, when Austria and Czechoslovakia had not yet been annexed by Germany. Since Germany declared its defeat, all power to manage Germany has been in the hands of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, the United States of America, and the Provisional Government of the French Republic. The German army, navy, and air force have all been defeated, so they have no choice but to unconditionally surrender to the United Nations. Now, defeated Germany, which should bear the responsibility for the war, cannot act against the will of the victorious countries. Germany now has no central government or central power to be responsible for maintaining order, managing the country, or fulfilling the demands put forward by the victors. Under this situation, Germany cannot order its army to cease hostile actions against the United Nations, nor can it declare that Germany should have the right to necessities. Representatives of the four major countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France will henceforth be called "United Nations Representatives," and they will each rely on the power of their own government and act in accordance with the</p>
<p>Joint Declaration</p>
<p>Currently, the four countries have issued a joint declaration, the main contents of which are as follows: The Provisional Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, the United States of America, and the French Republic will henceforth hold the highest authority in Germany, as well as the authority of the German government, the highest command, and all other temporary governments or municipal governments in Germany that have been handed over to our United Nations. However, holding this authority, rights, and power for the aforementioned purposes should not be regarded as an act of annexing Germany. The four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France will henceforth formulate the borderlines of Germany and determine the status of Germany, as well as all provinces that make up German territory.</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>Based on the highest authority, rights, and powers of the four governments, the United Nations Representatives put forward the following requirements: Since Germany has been completely defeated and unconditionally surrendered, Germany must fulfill the requirements we put forward.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Shanghai Branch of the News Association Welcomes Minister Shimada; Encourage Each Other to Strengthen Propaganda Through Unity and Consistency <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association held a tea party at the Majestic Hotel yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to welcome the newly appointed Minister Shimada of the Shanghai Army Department. The Minister arrived on time with Lieutenant Maehara, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Ensign Iijima, Maeda, Ejo, and Koike. They were received by Chen Binhe, the chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, and Chen Ripin, the managing director. Representatives of various member newspapers attended, including Osaga Yoichi, Hidaka Kiyomasa, Moriyama Takashi, Kim Ung-baek, Yang Jiong-lang, Lu Feng, and more than a hundred Chinese and Japanese reporters. First, Chen Binhe delivered a welcome speech, followed by a reply from Minister Shimada. The atmosphere was enthusiastic, and the meeting ended around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chen Binhe's Speech</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Colonel Shimada has recently come to Shanghai to serve as the Minister of the Army Department. Today, we colleagues in the news industry are holding a tea party to express our sincere welcome.</p>
<p>Although we are newly acquainted with Lieutenant Colonel Shimada, our relationship with the Army Department is very close, because the Army Department is our guiding agency. In the past, the Shanghai news industry has received a lot of guidance and assistance from the Army Department, and the ministers in the past have been able to interact sincerely. I believe that they will continue to provide us with more enthusiastic guidance and more practical assistance.</p>
<p>We have said many times that Shanghai is a place with the most rumors, and it is also the place where people are most likely to believe rumors. Therefore, we who are engaged in reporting and propaganda work feel particularly responsible. Because most of the manufacturers of rumors are due to the enemy's strategic role, how should we report the correct current events at any time, how should we analyze the trend of the current situation at any time, on the one hand, to instruct citizens to understand the truth of the current situation, on the other hand, to crush the enemy's rumors, is really an extremely difficult task. And how to promote and complete this work requires us in the news industry to unite and work together under the guidance of the reporting authorities. Today, on behalf of my colleagues in the news industry, I express my welcome with sincerity, and at the same time state the purpose of my work, and hope that Lieutenant Colonel Shimada will give us guidance."</p>
<p>Shimada's Reply</p>
<p>Minister Shimada replied, saying: "I was ordered to come to Shanghai to take on the reporting work, and I arrived the day before yesterday. Now the war situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the responsibility of those engaged in propaganda work is also increasing. Especially the reporting work centered on Shanghai is even more important. Not only in East Asia, but also in the world, the greatest propaganda effect in the future will be in Shanghai. Just as Mr. Chen Binhe said just now that the enemy is carrying out strategic propaganda against Shanghai, our countermeasure should be the unanimous unity of both Chinese and Japanese relations to crush the enemy's strategic propaganda. I am flattered by Mr. Chen's praise just now, but I have been to Shanghai several times in the past, and I also know many people in the press in Shanghai. In the future, when promoting work in various aspects, I hope to get more guidance."</p>
<h3 id="e17">The Security Corps Office Held a Joint Police-Security Meeting Yesterday, Deciding to Increase Security Corps Funding <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Department's Security Corps Office, in order to promote the efficiency of future security corps work, held a joint police-security meeting on the afternoon of the 6th. Director Gu of the Security Corps Office and Deputy Director Da Chuan both personally presided over the meeting. Also present were Second Director Pinggang, deputy directors of the Security Corps Office's district offices, section chiefs of various district police stations, chairmen of various security corps districts, and chief joint security chiefs, totaling more than one hundred people. Director Gu served as chairman of the meeting.</p>
<p>Reported Items</p>
<p>Each district should excavate air raid shelters, paying close attention to underground water pipes and gas pipes to avoid damage, and report damaged locations, as well as repair and clear accumulated water in air raid shelters. The "Strengthening Air Defense Facilities Week" has been implemented. Each security corps district is actively excavating family air raid shelters. An order has been received to replenish police defense materials and raise air defense funds. Nine districts have not yet submitted budgets; it is hoped that they will be compiled and reported as soon as possible, with a deadline of the end of June for completing the collection.</p>
<p>Discussion Items</p>
<p>Due to rising prices, it is proposed to increase security corps funding to cover expenses. It was resolved that, starting in July, households will be charged 300 yuan, primary households 600 yuan, and businesses 1,000 yuan. Special households will be reassessed by the chairman, chief joint security chief, and branch director, and implemented after approval.

<p>The Central Reserve Bank Tightens Credit</p>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank authorities, in view of the recent surge in prices and the prosperity of speculative activities, in order to curb the rise in prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, have tightened credit. The money supply for banks and money houses also tightened simultaneously starting on the afternoon of the 5th. It is understood that this move by the Central Reserve Bank, in addition to having significant implications for prices and speculative activities, is also related to the purchase of materials such as silk, rice, wheat, oil, and cotton, as well as the preparation of necessary cash.</p>
<h3 id="e19">The Finance Bureau Adjusts Property Tax in the Old City Area <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau stated that the property tax in this city, except for the old Districts 1 and 8, which have already been adjusted, has not yet been adjusted in parts of the old city area, such as Nanshi, Xucao, Wusong, and Pudong districts. It is now proposed to adjust the property tax in accordance with the old Districts 1 and 8, starting from this summer, using the property rent assessment standard of the 26th year of the Republic of China. The collected property tax will be uniformly collected at a tax rate of 14% based on 250 times the original amount. The assessment standards will be divided into residential, commercial, flat, multi-story, Western-style, factory, and warehouse categories, based on the quality of construction and market conditions, with the rental amount of each building assessed in sections. The above methods have been approved by the municipal government for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Training Time Regulations for the 18th Air Defense Day <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The 9th of this month is the 18th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters will, as usual, implement various air defense training activities and expand publicity on the meaning of air defense. The time for this air raid alarm training has been stipulated as 8:00 AM for training for alert alarms, 4:00 PM for training for air defense alarms, 5:00 PM for training for the lifting of air raid alarms, 9:00 PM for training for air raid alarms, 10:00 PM for training for the lifting of air raid alarms, and 10:30 PM for training for the lifting of alert alarms. However, the issuance and lifting of training alarms will not involve the sounding of sirens. If the sirens are heard, it is a real alarm, and citizens should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Strengthen Family Air Defense</p>
<p>The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters is implementing "Air Defense Facilities Strengthening Week" from the 1st to the 9th of this month. With the assistance of various police stations, family air defense facilities will be thoroughly strengthened, and air defense equipment will be increased as much as possible. In particular, air defense lampshades, window curtains, door drapes, and the like for lighting control must be complete, and no light should leak out during regular lighting control. The headquarters has dispatched personnel to various districts starting on the 6th to conduct random checks and inspections together with police and security personnel, and those found to be inadequate will be corrected.</p>
<p>Districts Are Actively Digging Small Air Raid Shelters</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to ensure the quantity and completeness of air raid shelters, the headquarters instructed each branch bureau to supervise each security corps district to organize and arrange the existing air raid shelters, and to urge citizens in each joint security unit and security corps district to automatically excavate small air raid shelters (the designs have been published in various newspapers, and various patterns can be used as references). This is to provide a place for refuge in case of emergency and to protect the safety of citizens' lives. Each district's enthusiasm for the excavation of these small air raid shelters is very high.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Postal Remittance Limits between Shanghai and North China <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Postal remittances between Central China and North China will be restricted starting this month. The authorities have also approved remittance limits between Shanghai and North China. The amount for this month shall not exceed 1.3 million yuan in Federal Reserve notes, equivalent to more than 7 million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. If the remittance quota is reached, remittances may be temporarily suspended. Furthermore, the market price of Federal Reserve notes in this city has been rising sharply in recent days, which has significantly affected the financial sector. According to sources in the banking and money industry, the exchange rate between Federal Reserve notes and Central Reserve Bank notes has not changed. However, the exchange rate of 10 Federal Reserve notes for 100 Central Reserve Bank notes is the result of speculation outside the industry for profit.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Charity School Meeting Resolves to Hold a Home Tutor Training Class <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Basic Education Lecture Series was reorganized into the newspaper's Compulsory Education Committee. At a meeting was held, attended by all committee members. The chairman first reported on the current situation of ten charity schools. In addition to the original twenty classes, seven new classes were added, and seven new teachers were hired. There are now a total of 1,162 students. The teaching situation in each school is considered good. Three supervisors rotate through the schools, discussing practical problems with the teachers at any time and reporting to the meeting. The following are excerpts from the discussion items: Due to the recent surge in prices, teachers' salaries for June will be increased by 50% compared to the previous month. Teachers who live particularly far from the school will be given additional transportation expenses. A public search will be conducted for a school building in a central location with spacious architecture in order to establish a compulsory middle school and a full-day compulsory elementary school. If there is an opportunity, the committee will send personnel to contact and determine a plan. Many middle and upper-class families hire tutors for their children during the summer. In view of the practical needs, the committee decided to hold a "Home Tutor Training Class" to provide short-term training and then introduce them to families. The details will be announced in the coming days. It was decided that the Basic Education Lecture Series would be merged into the management of this committee, renamed the "Education Lecture Series," and 200 elementary school teachers will be recruited. Lectures will be given every two weeks, and those with excellent performance will be given cash rewards. Those who are interested in further study will be recommended by the Student Aid Office to the Department of Education at the university and will be given student aid. Various charity schools need summer medicines, which will be collected from the pharmaceutical industry after selection. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.</p>

<p>The Buddhist Benevolent Society is actively assisting in the construction of a People's Village in the fire-stricken area of Yuyao Road. Eighty bamboo houses are nearing completion.

Furthermore, due to insufficient funds, he also donated his gold watch chain and ring, weighing a total of one tael, to the construction fund.

The society hopes that people from all walks of life will quickly provide assistance due to the recent soaring prices of labor and materials, so that the village can be completed as soon as possible, and all the poor disaster victims can find their place.</p>
