<h3>收回廣州灣租借地　國府昨發表聲明　行政權十六日已移管事</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　國民政府關於收回展州海租借地，於二十日下午四時，發衣聲明如次：前淸光續二十五年，即西　一八九九年，法國　口與列國在華努力均衡，對我國强制締結廣州灣租借條約，其租借期同爲九十九年，在該期間中，將實行統治該地，前以　洲戰爭後，因世界情勢激發，我國夙抱收回該租借地之決心，法國政府於國際會議席上，聲明將該租偕地父　。又民國二十三年三月二十日，發表交遺租界與撤廢　外法權聲明，是年逐次履行實施交還租界，然廣州灣租借地則至今迄未實踐，本年三月十日以後，法國於該租借地旣停止執行政權，廣州灣之法國軍備及武裝亦已被解除，如是光二十五年（即西紀一八九九年）　結之中，法兩國間關於租借廣州灣條約，巳完全失其契約之目的。中華民閣國民政府爲達成獨立自主及領土完整之目的，業於三十四年七月十六日，直接收回租借地之行政權，特此聲明。</p>
<h3>日東鄉相發表談話</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電日本帝國政府應中國政府之希望，以月之十六日爲期，業將舊法國租借地之廣州灣行政權，全部移管戰事，按廣州租借地，係當一八九九年即淸國光緒二十五年法國　英，美侵略中國之機，以九十九年爲期至租借條約，強制締約者，此次爲恢復被侵佔以來，適當第四十七年之中國領土，國民政府十六日接受該地之行政權，同時已即日任命該地有力者陣學談氏爲廣州灣行政區長。又日東鄉大東亞相對，國府收回廣州灣法國租借地　，發我談　如左：此次國府收回廣州灣法國租借地，帝國從來全幅協力回復中國主權，實堪慶　，回慣廣州灣租界地係光緒二十五年法國　英。美侵略中國之機而强制獲得者，晚近解放東亞之事業顯著進展之際，國府完成接收該租借地，實深慶幸。現英。美淪方又施其故技，再度置解放東亞諸國於其桎誥下，逞其甚略與恣意之時，國府逐漸完整主權，積極統一行政，期摧破帝國主義各國之不逞野心，且盆具堅心也。</p>
<h3>緬境戰鬥　日軍戰果</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地二十日中火社電　日軍於七月上旬渡過喜丹河，發動反攻，逐漸增强地步，敵軍受大動搖，乃調遣布洛姆附近之印度第七軍前赴喜丹　方面，積極防戰。又動員曼遠萊第三方面軍往曼達萊公路，戰綫刻已集中於喜丹河戰綫。</p>
<p>緬甸前前綫地二十日中央社電　敵亟欲奪　緬甸，乃集中大部兵力，進攻加洛，羅伊勒姆地方，企圖一舉突破加瑪，日軍則倚恃峻險，反擊來襲之敵，又日軍一　曾於雨中潛入敵陣，由七月上旬起，在加洛，羅伊勒姆附近曾殲敵二百人，鹵獲軍器極多。</p>
<h3>岡村大將談話　粵各報擁護</h3>
<p>廣州二十日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍德司令官岡村大將，日前對中國記者國發表關於日派遣軍之動向，及前延關係等之談話，十九日此間中日各報均以大字標題刋　之，翌二十日續有此項記載見報，極引人注目。尤以敵美自冲繩戰役，其軍事攻勢目標，是否爲日本本土或中國大陸最値注目之際，岡村大將今坦白就日派遺軍之立塲及將來之態度，率直披瀝其信念，對於中國民衆表明駐華日軍之嚴然態度，　因刻下各方面務求和平之聲頗高，有認爲日美決戰復於此荒廢之中國大陸行之，則中國民衆之慘禍更將增大，或猜測日軍將於其他地域求一決戰塲，甚至遽談及日本之撤兵問題，今由岡村大將之言詞，已將次種錯誤思想糾止，故極具好感。尤以新聞言論界方面，站於指導與論之立塲，對於日派遣軍之斷然　度，予以全幅之贊意及信賴，即對將來彼等之指導民衆方而，亦有絕大之反映。</p>
<h3>塔那底島　登陸軍肅淸</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地十九日中央社電　日軍於掃蕩塔那底島東方素特馬方面之殘敵後，迄至十六日又殲敵二百名，因比該島敵登陸軍已被完全肅淸。</p>
<h3>馬加籠被炸</h3>
<p>馬加聯十九日中央社電　十七日上午十一時許，敵B24型機二十四架，轟炸馬加薩，並對馬市收容荷蘭人婦孺等敵性市民之集團部落投下　夷彈，致死荷蘭人幼兒二名，東傷五名。</p>
<h3>對我羅災僑胞　日捐救濟金</h3>
<p>東京二十中央社電　於本月十二日設立之日華協會，對僑居日本之中國人民戰災者爲撫卹起見，二十日由坪上理事長代表近衡會長，赴我國大使館訪問王代理大使，捐金一封。</p>
<h3>日空軍轟炸沖繩　擊沉敵艦船兩艘</h3>
<p>前綫基地二十日中央社電　日航空部隊十八日晚間攻擊沖總島之敵陸上基地及周團之敵艦艇，因之沖繩北機塲發生大火災，又擊沉巡洋艦二艘，大型艦或渝送船一艘。</p>
<h3>救國必勝之策</h3>
<p>— 日本軍中將石原爾</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電日陸軍中將石原莞爾氏，當此非常時局，特將氏抱懷之救國必勝之三大同榮，訴之該國朝　，殊可注目，茲　譯其全文如次：戰局並不於我有利，帝國已　本土決戰之　緣，洵爲國步艱難之秋，余於達觀滿洲事　，中日事變，大東亞戰爭之餘，滿懷感慨，惟今日已非空論之時，唯應考慮如何打此危局，進以救國必勝之策三　，之策　三　，希望全國</p>
<h3>顯揚日本國體精華</h3>
<p>第一爲天皇親政之我國國體精華，彌益光　，天皇爲陸，海軍之最高統帥者，又爲萬機之所歸，亦即天皇總握一般統治權及統帥權，此我國體之所長，爲他國望塵莫及者。他國於戰時中英生之政戰兩略不一致等情事，在顯揚我國體精華之塲合，決無此　，聖斷一下，莫不捨一切翁然而從，一致邁進，如此對外可發揮戰略，對內得綜合戰力至最高度。</p>
<h3>言論結社澈底自由</h3>
<p>第二爲言論結社之澈底自由，言論原非欲加抑制而可抑制者，若加强行，則每使國民强迫盲從，自發刺之國民中產生出無精神力或反動之潑刺言論，由來長期戰爭切忌報這虛偽，總之，於不知不覺中，常使國民明悉除軍機以外之各事實，此外則可不勞而造成與國民其憂喜之理想的思想狀態。桔社之自由，爲產生國民旺盛力晨之根源，過去之團體國民組織，幾全爲管制性的，雖有旺盛的力量，而自上加以管制，則結果不可期也，發乎潑刺之言論，懷救國之熱情，進而結盟，此方爲眞正之戰鬥禮，可期新英雄之產生。</p>
<p>共次爲結成眞　　家練力戰形態。際此切迫之秋，更覺迄今日本國家總力戰之概念，全屬錯誤。世人認爲總力戰者，即軍當局可兼領政治，經濟以及一復，實則遭相反，重隊　可顯及作戰方而，官民則須變爲純粹之軍人，期軍無後顯之憂，傾全力於政治，經濟各方面，此爲總力戰之眞義。蓋軍隊本在作戰，無暇顧及政洽方面，以軍官民相互信賴而作戰之日本，轉換爲眞正總力戰形態，稍失時機，此固不容否認，但急去實行，　未晚也。</p>
<h3>剩留者移往燒毀地</h3>
<p>提及本土作戰，先一個大問題是如何防　敵之空襲，敵決不輕率登陸，必也先施行熾烈之空襲，期使日本全國澈底焦土化，我人將何以應付之。予曩已唱議國內人口之重配置，此即謂將人口。食糧。工塲生產之三者，加以科學的考慮，將此重配置於各地域是也。將已經燒燬之地區及將來被燒燬之各都市需要之剩留者，全部疏散於燒燬地城，由都市脫出之人口，則計劃的配置於農村。</p>
<h3>大都市不適合戰事</h3>
<p>日本之戰力，如能不依靠大都市，則食糧可各也確保，工塲旣設在地下及擊村，則日本更可强靱作戰，故予夙即主張不需要大都市，由戰爭深刻化觀之，大都市已不適合於現代戰，隨具有戰力破壞性之新兵器出現，如國家仍集中其大部生產力於大都市，可謂即其最大弱點之暴露也。</p>
<h3>延安籌備樹立　協力政權說</h3>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　延安爲與渝方之國民大會對抗，意定於十一月十二日召開中國解放區人民代表會　，刻正進行籌備，渝當局聞此消息，頗爲興奮。據朮慶合衆社電稱，延安有糾合各派樹立協力政權之計劃此於渝方之刺激尤深。延安之目的，乃在結成民主統亦之協力政權，國共之關係破綻功囚此而生，若此消息確係事實，則早已與渝政權分袂而樹立自派指導之　力政權矣，然因未有延安確報，致不明其興相。而合衆社曾報告渝當局之態度如次，淪政權因未得正確之情報，故木日會見新聞記者團時，其發言者未能正式表明態度云。</p>
<h3>渝參政會　通過要案</h3>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據重慶合衆社來電，渝國民參政會十七日通過各案如次：　即時批准國際憲章案，　渝。英。海。法四國締結軍事同盟，該同盟案主張四國應效英蘇，法蘇友好援助條約，以二十年爲限締結四國回盟條約，由重慶政權開始交涉。據合衆計電稱，同盟案中所以美國不在內者，如因條約明係遠反美國傳統政策，故來將美國引入。至於國民参政會突然決議出人意外事項者，乃因延安代表以下各進步派分子，前曾對會議加以抵制，致使一般人士極爲灰心，爲期促使國民注意，並期挽回一般人士菲難「對日總反攻有名無實」計，重慶乃提議使聯合國共同戰綫發展至同盟關係，用以對國內期滿，其用意甚爲明顯。</p>
<h3>B29型機百餘架　襲福井尼崎　證實擊落毀二十四架</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電南方基地敵B29型機約一百七十架，十九日晚十時半起，亘一小時半，空襲近畿地區，其主力約百二十架，以燒夷彈攻擊福井市，一部編隊五十架，於尼崎市附近投下炸彈，另一部約五架，曾投機　於若狹灣內，內之，福井市，尼崎市附近之一部工塲被炸發生火災，然至二十日晟，已全部撲滅。至日方之戰果，業由巾部軍管區司令部大阪醫備府於當日晟十時發表如次：現已證實者，計擊落敵機五架，擊毀十九架。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　敵Ｂ29型機約八十架，自十九日夜半起　二時間，由志摩半　侵入岡崎市附近，加以燒夷攻擊，致該市附近發生火災，至拂曉完全撲滅。</p>
<h3>東部數小都市空襲</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　敵B29型機約百五十架，十九日晚十一時起，約歷三小時，以單機或小編隊，分散來襲目東部軍營區，對少數小都市曾投下燃燒彈，其第一梯團約八十架，由晚十一時十分迄翌晟時四十五分間，向茨稱縣。日立市。高秋町，豐浦町。多賀町。大津町等地投下燒夷彈。第二梯團約六十架。於二十日零時三十分至三時之間，以燒夷彈攻擊　子市，因之各地發生火災，然未幾即被撲滅。又另有B29八十架，二十日晨零時四十五分至　一時三十分之間。曾投機雷與新　附近海上，經日軍防空砲貨擊落二架，擊傷三架。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>爲急救突襲難民向全市民呼</h3>
<p>十七十八兩日，本市遭敵機轟炸，被災區無辜市民遭難之慘，全市市民，或爲目睹，或爲耳聞，諒必都已留有極深刻的印象。爲人道計，爲公德計，爲本市市民未來安全計，凡是今日未受災難的市民，對於已遭不幸者，都有從事救濟的實任。因此，我們竭誠向全市市民呼籲，有錢的出錢，有力的有力，共同建立起空襲救災的統一組織，迅速推進切切實實的救災工作。如果這種組織健全，工作迅速而切實，則不僅現在無數已遭災殃者可獲救濟，而且將來敵機冉來肆虐時，也可因爲有了這種有組織有計劃的救濟工作，而減少許多損失，或減輕損害的程度。</p>
<p>目前急待解决者，第一是空襲下死亡者之掩埋問題，在此盛暑季節，露屍里巷，在公共衛生上爲害殊烈，自應從速掩埋。第二是受傷者尤其是重傷者的療治，尤賴各區各街的公私醫院醫室及醫師，一致挺身而出，擔負這種緊急救護的工作，第三，在空襲下受難者，有的老年人失去了兒女，有的兒童及少年失去了父母，又有的婦失其夫，或因重傷殘廢，頓失所依，生浩無着，尤應統籌救濟。</p>
<p>爲了緊急救濟空襲受難者起見，木市市民福利協會，昨日特假本報會議室召集理事會，並邀本市羅秘書長出席指導。從這一次會議上，可以表示在此危急之際，本市市政當局與各界領袖，在救濟災難一點上，都有極大的童同情關切及一致的意見。羅秘書長更認定必須民間自動奮起配合當局從事救濟工作，而民間組織尤須統一，陣能集中力量，齊一步驟，以圖迅赴事功。</p>
<p>救濟工作，首需經費，而在目前物價情形下，尤需鉅額經費，因此，不能不臨時向市民勸募。市民福利會諸理事，昨在會議席上，即席認募一萬萬元，市府方面除指撥救濟庫券中一部分外，雖在經費困難環境下，另撥一萬萬元，以宏成效。本報對於社會公益，素以先驅爲職志，目前本身經濟雖在極度拮据中，但寗可舉債，也捐助一千萬元。同業新聞報社，也自動捐助一千萬元，新中國報及小報，亦自動捐集一百萬元，海報並將全部疏散助金移捐，均無非站在輿論界立塲，以示倡導。本報社會服務處於十九日起已代收各界捐款，兩日之間，幾達三千萬元，足見同情大有人在，不勝欣慰。仍盼全市各界，一致仗義繼起，共圖完成這次救濟工作。</p>
<p>現在關於空襲救濟工作，各界頗有自動組織者，其急公好義的精神，都値欽佩。我們希望各種組織在同一目標之下，爲集中力量以宏成效起見，　可能和市民福利協會方面取得密切的連絡一致，一方面可以符合當局統一推進救濟工作的期待，另一方面也可以避免分散及其他不妥的傾向。</p>
<p>最後，我們尚有三點要向全市市民呼籲：第一，不久以前市府發行之救濟庫券項下，原有指撥一部分爲空襲救濟經費，惟原有民間認購部分，尚有已認未繳及織未足數的，希望各業公會負責人注意，如尚未繳齊，應即如數微足，而使早日運用於救濟工作，萬勿再存觀望，致貽物議。第二，市民福利協會巳決定成立各組委員會，並分區成立急救醫所，俱是爲求今後能各區各街均能就近救治受難者起見，希望各區醫院及醫師自動挺身參加救護工作。第三，今後空襲頻仍，醫療用具及藥品之需要日增，我們一方面希望大小藥房儘量平價供應，另一方面更希望凡爲紗布藥棉紅藥水樟腦油等等的囤戶，迅即發現天良，大量出售（能捐助自是更好），要知道炸彈是無情的，將來全部燬損的機會很多，還不如早點出售的好！</p>
<p>空襲救濟，時迫事急，願全市市民一致奮起，早日完成祖織，積極推進工作。電　敵B29型機約八十架，自十九日夜半起亘二時間，由志摩半島侵入岡崎市附近，加以燒夷彈攻擊，致該市附近發生火災，至佛曉完全撲滅</p>
<h3>蘇聯計劃　戰後建設　大水閘與蓄水池</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據　斯社巴庫電：於阿沙巴加共軍中央委員會會議時，黨部書記巴基浴夫宣稱，政府業決定建築明格巧萊水閘，其規模之大，僅次於彌伯水附，並於高加案山脈發源之庫拉河上游風景　大之區，將建設一世界最大之蓄水池，計長長達七十五公里，關達二十五公里，可容水七萬萬立方公尺，如此則庫拉河與阿拉克斯河水即能完全加以控制，作爲擊業灌溉之用，不久將來狠陋之田地必將增加三倍，而達一自五十萬公頃。</p>
<h3>波海運河興工修築</h3>
<p>中央社訊自白海通達波羅的海之運河修理工作，將在下一次航行季節開始之前完成。沿運河河岸現已積極展開修築工事，各種水閘與水障亦在建築之中，主要水閘之建築工事，可望於十月中完成。</p>

<p>嗣由野口致詞謂：本月十七十八兩日，敵機空襲上海之救護救濟　　，　略向　君報告如下：過去防空本部對於敵機之可能　滬，故　極訓練救護担架等隊隊員，以作爲一　備。　於最近敵機竟爾來，施行盲目轟炸。其間死傷者，以中國人佔大多數，而日本人則佔極少數，由於此次突襲，希全市市民對防空本部之措施，尤應多加注意。在敵機　滬時，救濟救護等隊隊員，工作　極努力，但仍未能滿意，所有各方面之建議，本部自當誠意接受。</p>
<p>希望市民準備</p>
<p>關於各私立醫院，此次所收容之病人，本部決供給醫藥上所需之材料，　可保障順利進行其事。倘蘇州河以南地區發生空襲，其救護事宜，本部亦早有充分準備。市民當可以此次之經騐，對本部之防空準備，而有進一步之認識。此外當局及各方對本部工作，均竭力協助，所需之救護材料，可不致發生困難，且絕對負責供應醫藥之材料需要。惟萬一某處被空襲或多處被空　，需要材料自極殷切，深盼各界人士多多捐輸。</p>
<p>醫院勒索診費</p>
<p>本部之救護隊有中國人及外國人之組織，準備將來運用，如前次空襲滬東北區，外國人之防空隊中有匈牙利國僑民醫師兩人，自動前往救護，　意有若干醫院，竟有索納現款，方可醫病之事，此誠爲上　醫界中之最大恥辱。蓋醫生所有技術，應於此戰時無代價全國貢獻於社會，然其所消耗之材料，本部當預備減少共消耗。</p>
<p>衣食未雨綢繆</p>
<p>空襲下不獨糧食問題，即衣服亦　需要，本人前曾有一計　，希望每一市民能捐食來一升，分貯各處，集少成多，便可合併普遍性之救濟。萬一空襲地區災民急需，亦不致發生糧食恐慌。此時民生雖較困難，祗須市民共體斯旨，即以每一家捐米一升，亦可辦到空襲糧食救濟之預備。至於衣服問題，市民亦可將多餘於衣服包一包，送存該管警局，以作萬一衣服　　時應用。如無空襲災害者，當可取回，但此糧食及衣服之預備，本總不　主動此事，望市民各能自動準備爲最　。</p>
<p>開掘防空壕事</p>
<p>市民未至相當時期，尙不明本部設施之目的，如發動開掘防空壕時，各方多予　難。今此項空襲，凡市民已　入防空壕者，居然得保生命，由此次之　騐，市民應對發掘防空壕之重要性，加以深切之認識。</p>
<p>各區設救護站</p>
<p>蘇州河以南方　將依　警局管區高立防空管區十三處，每區設隊長，以下分設救護站，站以下設救護担架等班，每區且均有外科產科醫生擔任救護員。本部現並成立救護隊五隊，擔當特別指派之工作，所有市立各醫院均爲救護之基本醫院，同時並望市民注意，受傷之止血方法，應信當局所示，切勿自從擅以未消毒之品敷之，而遭意外之死傷。</p>

<h3>Recovery of Guangzhou Bay Leased Territory: National Government Issued Statement Yesterday; Administrative Rights Transferred on the 16th</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency): Regarding the recovery of the Guangzhou Bay leased territory, the National Government issued the following statement at 4:00 PM on the 20th: The Qing Dynasty, Guangxu 25th year, that is, 1899 AD, France, in order to equalize efforts with other nations in China, forcibly concluded the Guangzhou Bay Leased Territory Treaty with our country. The lease period was ninety-nine years, during which they would exercise governance over the area. After the European War, due to the heightened global situation, our country long held the determination to recover the leased territory. The French government declared at international conferences that it would return the leased territory. Furthermore, on March 20th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, a statement was issued on returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, and the return of concessions was gradually implemented that year. However, the Guangzhou Bay leased territory has not yet been returned. After March 10th of this year, France ceased exercising administrative power in the leased territory, and French military equipment and arms in Guangzhou Bay have also been dismantled. Therefore, the Guangzhou Bay Lease Treaty concluded in Guangxu 25th year (i.e., 1899 AD) has completely lost its contractual purpose between the two countries, China and France. In order to achieve independence, autonomy, and territorial integrity, the National Government of the Republic of China directly recovered the administrative rights of the leased territory on July 16th, 34th year of the Republic, and hereby declares this.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister Togo's Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Government, in accordance with the wishes of the Chinese government, transferred all administrative rights of Guangzhou Bay, the former French leased territory, by the 16th of this month. The Guangzhou leased territory was a treaty forcibly concluded by France during the opportunity of the British and American invasion of China in 1899, i.e., the 25th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, with a term of ninety-nine years. This time, the National Government accepted the administrative rights of the territory on the 16th, which is the appropriate 47th year since it was invaded and occupied, to recover Chinese territory and immediately appointed Mr. Zhen Xuedan, an influential figure in the area, as the chief of the Guangzhou Bay administrative district. Moreover, Togo, the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, issued the following statement regarding the National Government's recovery of the French leased territory of Guangzhou Bay: The Empire has always fully cooperated in restoring Chinese sovereignty regarding the National Government's recovery of the French leased territory of Guangzhou Bay, and it is truly cause for celebration. The recovery of the Guangzhou Bay leased territory, which France forcibly acquired during the British and American invasion of China in the 25th year of Guangxu, coincides with the remarkable progress in the cause of liberating East Asia, and we deeply rejoice in the National Government's completion of the reception of this leased territory. Currently, Britain and the United States are again employing their old tricks, once again placing the liberated East Asian nations under their yokes, displaying their rampant aggression and willfulness. The National Government is gradually completing its sovereignty, actively unifying its administration, aiming to crush the unscrupulous ambitions of imperialist countries, and possesses an even firmer determination.</p>
<h3>Battles in Burma: Japanese Army's War Results</h3>
<p>Burma Frontline Base, 20th (Central Fire News Agency): In early July, the Japanese army crossed the Xitang River and launched a counteroffensive, gradually strengthening their position. The enemy army was greatly shaken and dispatched the Indian 7th Army near Bloom to the Xitang area to actively defend. They also mobilized the Mandalay 3rd Army to the Mandalay Highway. The battle lines are now concentrated on the Xitang River front.</p>
<p>Burma Front Frontline Base, 20th (Central News Agency): The enemy is eager to seize Burma, so they concentrated a large number of troops to attack Kalaw and Loiilem, attempting to break through Gama in one fell swoop. The Japanese army relied on the steep terrain to counterattack the invading enemy. A unit of the Japanese army also sneaked into the enemy's position in the rain. Since early July, they have annihilated 200 enemies near Kalaw and Loiilem, capturing many weapons.</p>
<h3>General Okamura's Remarks: Guangzhou Newspapers Support</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency): General Okamura, commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces stationed in China, recently made remarks to Chinese reporters regarding the movements of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces and the relationship with the former Yan'an. On the 19th, various Chinese and Japanese newspapers here published them with large headlines, and continuing reports appeared on the 20th, attracting much attention. Especially at a time when the enemy's (America's) military offensive target since the Okinawa campaign is whether it is the Japanese mainland or the Chinese mainland, General Okamura frankly disclosed the position of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces and their future attitude, candidly conveying their beliefs to the Chinese people, showing the solemn attitude of the Japanese army stationed in China. Because the voices of peace are quite high at the moment, some believe that a decisive battle between Japan and the United States will be fought in this devastated Chinese mainland, which will increase the suffering of the Chinese people even more, or they speculate that the Japanese army will seek a decisive battleground in other regions, and even hastily discuss the issue of Japan's troop withdrawal. General Okamura's words have corrected these erroneous ideas, so they are highly appreciated. Especially the news media, standing in the position of guiding public opinion, fully approve and trust the decisive attitude of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces, which will have a great impact on their future guidance of the people.</p>
<h3>Landing Forces Clearing Ternate Island</h3>
<p>Southern Frontline Base, 19th (Central News Agency): After sweeping the remaining enemy forces in the Sotoma area east of Ternate Island, the Japanese army annihilated another 200 enemies by the 16th, and as a result, the enemy landing forces on the island have been completely cleared.</p>
<h3>Makassar Bombed</h3>
<p>Makassar, 19th (Central News Agency): At around 11:00 AM on the 17th, 24 enemy B-24 aircraft bombed Makassar and dropped incendiary bombs on the group settlement of Dutch women, children, and other enemy civilians in the city, killing two Dutch children and injuring five.</p>
<h3>Japan Donates Relief Funds to Our Disaster-Stricken Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): The Japan-China Association, established on the 12th of this month, in order to provide comfort to Chinese people residing in Japan who have been affected by the war, the chairman of the board of directors, Mr. Tsuboue, on behalf of the president, Mr. Konoe, visited Acting Ambassador Wang at our embassy on the 20th and donated a sum of money.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Bombs Okinawa, Sinking Two Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>Frontline Base, 20th (Central News Agency): On the evening of the 18th, the Japanese air force attacked the enemy land bases on Okinawa Island and the surrounding enemy ships, causing a major fire at the Okinawa North Airport and sinking two cruisers and one large warship or transport ship.</p>
<h3>Strategy for Certain Victory in Saving the Nation</h3>
<p>— Lieutenant General Ishihara Kanji of the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): Lieutenant General Ishihara Kanji of the Japanese Army, in this extraordinary situation, specially communicated his three grand ideals for saving the nation to the country's court, which is noteworthy. The full translation of his article is as follows: The war situation is not in our favor, and the Empire is already facing the prospect of a decisive battle on the mainland, which is truly a difficult autumn for the nation. After reflecting on the Manchurian Incident, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Greater East Asia War, I am filled with emotion. Today is not a time for empty talk, but rather for considering how to overcome this crisis and advance with three strategies for certain victory in saving the nation, hoping the entire nation will:</p>
<h3>Promote the Essence of the Japanese National Polity</h3>
<p>First, the essence of our national polity, where the Emperor personally governs, should shine even brighter. The Emperor is the supreme commander of the army and navy, and all matters are referred to him. That is, the Emperor has overall control of general governing power and command authority. This is the strength of our national polity, unmatched by other countries. Other countries may experience inconsistencies between political and military strategies during wartime, but this will never occur in a setting that promotes the essence of our national polity. Once a sacred decision is made, everyone will set aside everything and follow it wholeheartedly, advancing in unison. In this way, we can develop the best strategy externally and integrate combat power to the highest degree internally.</p>
<h3>Complete Freedom of Speech and Association</h3>
<p>Second, there should be complete freedom of speech and association. Speech cannot be suppressed by force. If it is forcibly suppressed, it will cause the people to blindly follow, and without spiritual strength, rebellious and rash remarks will emerge from among the people. Long-term wars absolutely prohibit the reporting of falsehoods. In short, the people should be consciously and gradually informed of all facts except for military secrets. In addition, the ideal state of mind, where the people share joys and sorrows, can be created without effort. Freedom of association is the root for generating the vigorous power of the people. In the past, almost all national organizations were controlling in nature. Although they possessed vigorous strength, the control from above ultimately led to unpredictable results. To make rash remarks, to have a passion for saving the nation, and then to form alliances, this is the true way of fighting, and the emergence of new heroes can be expected.</p>
<p>Third, to form a truly national force, practicing a battle-ready formation. At this critical juncture, it is even more evident that the concept of total national war effort has been completely wrong in Japan. The world believes that total war effort means that the military authorities can concurrently manage politics, economy, and everything else. In reality, the opposite is true. The military should only focus on combat operations, and the government and people must transform into pure soldiers, so the military can have no worries and devote all their energy to politics, economy, and all aspects, which is the true meaning of total war effort. Since the military is engaged in combat, they have no time to attend to political matters. Japan, where the military and people trust each other and fight together, transforming into a true total war effort formation, even if the opportune moment is slightly missed, cannot be denied. But it is not too late to implement it urgently.</p>
<h3>Those Remaining Should Be Moved to Burned Areas</h3>
<p>Regarding homeland operations, the first major issue is how to defend against enemy air raids. The enemy will not land rashly, but will first carry out intense air raids, aiming to thoroughly scorch the entire Japanese mainland. How will we respond? I have long advocated the redistribution of the domestic population, that is, to scientifically consider the three elements of population, food, and factory production, and redistribute them to various regions. Those who have been burned out or will be burned out in various cities should be completely evacuated to the burned areas. The population evacuated from the cities should be systematically relocated to rural areas.</p>
<h3>Large Cities Are Unsuitable for War</h3>
<p>If Japan's war effort can not rely on large cities, the food supply can also be secured. Factories can be built underground and in rural villages, making Japan stronger for war. That's why I have long argued that large cities are unnecessary. From the perspective of the deepening war, large cities are no longer suitable for modern warfare. With the appearance of new weapons with the ability to destroy war effort, if the nation still concentrates most of its production in large cities, it can be said to be exposing its greatest weakness.</p>
<h3>Yan'an Prepares to Establish a Co-operative Government</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency): In order to confront the Chongqing government's National Assembly, Yan'an intends to convene the People's Representative Conference of the Chinese Liberated Areas on November 12th and is currently making preparations. The Chongqing authorities were quite excited upon hearing this news. According to a United Press report from Chongqing, Yan'an has plans to unite various factions to establish a cooperative government, which has particularly stimulated Chongqing. Yan'an's goal is to form a democratic and unified cooperative government. The cracks in the relationship between the KMT and the CCP were born from this. If this news is confirmed, then they will have long separated from the Chongqing government and established a cooperative government guided by their own faction. However, due to the lack of definitive reports from Yan'an, the truth is unclear. The United Press reported the attitude of the Chongqing authorities as follows: The Chongqing government has not received accurate information and therefore its spokesperson was unable to formally express an attitude at today's meeting with the press corps.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Political Council Passes Important Proposals</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency): According to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing National Political Council passed the following resolutions on the 17th: (1) To immediately ratify the International Charter; (2) The four countries of Chongqing, Britain, the United States, and France should conclude a military alliance. The proposal for the alliance advocates that the four countries should emulate the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance between Britain and the Soviet Union, and France and the Soviet Union, concluding a four-country alliance treaty for a period of twenty years, with negotiations initiated by the Chongqing government. According to United Press, the reason the United States is not included in the alliance is because the treaty clearly contradicts the traditional policy of the United States, so they did not bring the United States in. As for the sudden resolution of unexpected matters by the National Political Council, it is because progressive elements, including representatives from Yan'an, had previously boycotted the meeting, causing widespread discouragement. In order to attract national attention and to reverse the general impression that the "general counteroffensive against Japan is nominal rather than real," Chongqing proposed to develop the joint front of the United Nations into an alliance relationship in order to meet domestic expectations, with a very clear intention.</p>
<h3>Over 100 B-29 Aircraft Attack Fukui and Amagasaki; Confirmed 24 Shot Down and Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): Approximately 170 enemy B-29 aircraft from the Southern Base attacked the Kinki region for an hour and a half starting at 10:30 PM on the 19th. The main force of approximately 120 aircraft attacked Fukui City with incendiary bombs. A formation of 50 aircraft dropped bombs near Amagasaki City. Another unit of approximately 5 aircraft dropped bombs in Wakasa Bay. As a result, some factories near Fukui City and Amagasaki City were bombed and caught fire, but they were all extinguished by the 20th. As for the Japanese side's war results, the Osaka Garrison Headquarters of the Central Military District Command announced the following at 10:00 AM that day: Currently confirmed, 5 enemy aircraft were shot down and 19 were destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): Approximately 80 enemy B-29 aircraft, for two hours starting from midnight on the 19th, invaded near Okazaki City from the Shima Peninsula and attacked with incendiary bombs, causing fires in the city. The fires were completely extinguished by dawn.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Several Small Cities in the East</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency): Approximately 150 enemy B-29 aircraft, for about three hours starting at 11:00 PM on the 19th, in single aircraft or small formations, attacked various small cities scattered throughout the Eastern Military District, dropping incendiary bombs. The first wave of approximately 80 aircraft dropped incendiary bombs on Hitachi City, Takahagi Town, Toyoura Town, Taga Town, Otsu Town, etc., in Ibaraki Prefecture from 11:10 PM to 4:45 AM the next day. The second wave of approximately 60 aircraft attacked Choshi City with incendiary bombs between 0:30 AM and 3:00 AM on the 20th, causing fires in various places, but they were soon extinguished. In addition, 80 B-29 aircraft dropped naval mines in the sea near Niigata between 0:45 AM and 1:30 AM on the 20th. The Japanese army's anti-aircraft artillery shot down two aircraft and damaged three.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Calling on All Citizens to Rescue Victims of the Sudden Raids</h3>
<p>On the 17th and 18th, our city was bombed by enemy aircraft. The miserable suffering of the innocent citizens in the affected areas was witnessed or heard by all citizens, and we believe that everyone has been left with a very deep impression. For the sake of humanity, for the sake of public morals, and for the sake of the future safety of the citizens of our city, all citizens who have not suffered disasters today have a real responsibility to engage in relief efforts for those who have been unfortunate. Therefore, we earnestly appeal to all citizens to contribute money if they have money, and contribute strength if they have strength, to jointly establish a unified organization for air raid disaster relief, and to quickly advance the real disaster relief work. If this organization is sound and the work is quick and practical, not only can countless people who have already suffered disasters be rescued now, but also when enemy aircraft come to wreak havoc again in the future, we can reduce many losses or mitigate the extent of damage because we have this organized and planned relief work.</p>
<p>The most urgent issues to be resolved are, first, the burial of those killed in the air raids. In this hot season, exposing corpses in the streets and alleys is extremely harmful to public health and should be buried as soon as possible. Second, the treatment of the injured, especially the seriously injured, relies on the public and private hospitals, medical offices, and doctors in each district and street to stand up together and assume this emergency rescue work. Third, among those who have suffered in the air raids, some elderly people have lost their children, some children and teenagers have lost their parents, and some women have lost their husbands, or have lost their means of support due to severe injuries and disabilities, and their lives have no direction. They should be rescued in a unified manner.</p>
<p>For the sake of emergency relief for air raid victims, the Citizens' Welfare Association of our city specially convened a board meeting at our newspaper's conference room yesterday and invited Secretary-General Luo of our city to attend and provide guidance. From this meeting, it can be seen that in this critical moment, the municipal authorities and leaders from all walks of life in our city have great sympathy, concern, and agreement on the issue of disaster relief. Secretary-General Luo further affirmed that the people must automatically rise up to cooperate with the authorities in carrying out relief work, and that the people's organizations must be unified to concentrate their efforts and take unified steps to achieve results quickly.</p>
<p>Relief work requires funding first, and under the current price situation, a large amount of funding is especially needed. Therefore, we must temporarily solicit donations from the citizens. The directors of the Citizens' Welfare Association immediately pledged 10 million yuan at the meeting. In addition to allocating a portion of the relief bonds, the city government allocated another 10 million yuan, despite the difficult financial situation, to achieve greater results. Our newspaper has always taken the lead in social welfare, and although its own economy is in extreme difficulties, it would rather take out a loan and donate 10 million yuan. The newspaper company of the same industry also voluntarily donated 10 million yuan, and the New China Daily and tabloids also voluntarily raised 1 million yuan. The Shanghai News will also donate all of its evacuation assistance funds, all of which are intended to demonstrate advocacy from the standpoint of the media. Our newspaper's social service department has been collecting donations from all walks of life since the 19th, and in two days, it has reached nearly 30 million yuan, which shows that there are many people who sympathize with us, which is gratifying. We still hope that all sectors of the city will unite and continue to act righteously to jointly complete this relief work.</p>
<p>Currently, many sectors are spontaneously organizing air raid relief work, and their spirit of public service is admirable. We hope that under the same goal, for the sake of concentrating efforts to achieve greater results, all organizations should establish close contact with the Citizens' Welfare Association. On the one hand, it can meet the expectations of the authorities to promote relief work in a unified manner, and on the other hand, it can avoid dispersion and other inappropriate tendencies.</p>
<p>Finally, we still have three points to appeal to all citizens: First, a portion of the relief bonds issued by the city government not long ago was originally designated for air raid relief expenses. However, there are still some who have subscribed but not paid or who have not paid enough for the original civilian subscription. We hope that the responsible persons of the various industry associations will pay attention. If they have not been paid in full, they should be paid in full as soon as possible so that they can be used for relief work as soon as possible, and do not wait and see again, so as not to leave a bad impression. Second, the Citizens' Welfare Association has decided to establish various committees and establish first-aid medical stations in various districts. This is to ensure that the victims can be treated nearby in each district and street in the future. We hope that hospitals and doctors in various districts will automatically stand up and participate in the rescue work. Third, air raids will become more frequent in the future, and the need for medical supplies and medicines will increase. On the one hand, we hope that large and small pharmacies will supply them at affordable prices as much as possible. On the other hand, we hope that all those who are hoarding gauze, cotton wool, red potion, camphor oil, etc. will quickly find their conscience and sell them in large quantities (it would be even better if they could donate!). You must know that bombs are merciless, and there will be many opportunities for them to be completely destroyed in the future, so it is better to sell them earlier!</p>
<p>Air raid relief is urgent and imminent. We hope that all citizens will unite and rise up to complete the organization and actively promote the work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Plans Post-War Construction: Large Sluice Gates and Reservoirs</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report from Tass News Agency, Baku: At a meeting of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party, Party Secretary Bagirov declared that the government has decided to build the Mingachevir Sluice Gate, the scale of which is second only to the Kuibyshev Dam, and to construct one of the world's largest reservoirs in the scenic area upstream of the Kura River, which originates in the Caucasus Mountains. It will be 75 kilometers long and 25 kilometers wide, capable of holding 70 million cubic meters of water. In this way, the waters of the Kura River and the Araxes River can be fully controlled and used for irrigation, and the barren land will inevitably increase threefold to 1.5 million hectares in the near future.</p>
<h3>Restoration Work Underway for the White Sea-Baltic Canal</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The repair work on the canal connecting the White Sea to the Baltic Sea will be completed before the next navigation season begins.

<p>Central News Agency report from Tass News Agency, Tehran: In the late night of July 16, bombing incidents occurred one after another at the People's Party Club in Tehran and the residences of Iranian Parliament member Latmanishi and Kam Keksha, a member of the Central Committee of the People's Party, but there were no deaths or injuries.</p>
<h3>Anti-Soviet Sentiment Among the Iranian People</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency): The Soviet government has recently used news media to criticize anti-Soviet elements in neighboring countries. According to a Moscow dispatch, Pravda ridiculed and fiercely criticized Chang Taiying, the speaker of the Iranian lower house, who was regarded as a central figure of anti-Soviet elements, on the 16th. This person used to be the Iranian Prime Minister, and was elected as a lower house official last year. When the Soviet Union and Iran were negotiating the division of oil rights, he insisted on a tough stance against the Soviet Union and was the central figure in the Iranian government who opposed the cession of rights. Also, according to Tass News Agency of Pravda, the reactionary atmosphere in Iran has been extremely strong recently. The Egyptian newspaper published in Cairo stated that a national association has been established in northern Iran, advocating the liberation of the Azerbaijan region, and at the same time wanting to merge the region under Iranian control with Azerbaijan under Soviet control to form a federation.</p>
<h3>America Builds Over a Thousand Ships in Five Years</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Washington via TASS: The U.S. Navy Department recently announced that between July 1, 1940, and July 1, 1945, the military shipyards and twenty private shipyards of the United States built a total of 331 military ships and 991 ships respectively, totaling 1,322 ships. This included 10 battleships, 27 aircraft carriers, 112 escort aircraft carriers, 12 heavy cruisers, 33 light cruisers, 370 destroyers, 548 destroyer escorts, and 210 submarines. The department further stated that 223 more warships would be built in the 1945-1946 fiscal year, and pointed out that on July 1, 1940, the U.S. Navy consisted of only 381 warships.</p>
<h3>Eight Million Germans Assigned to Labor Service</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 20th: European commentators hold differing views on the use of German prisoners of war to pay reparations. According to news from New York, Britain is using 100,000 German prisoners to harvest crops, Norway has 400,000 German prisoners engaged in labor, and France, in addition to currently using German prisoners for farming, plans to use 1.75 million German prisoners for industrial labor. Italy has also requested 200,000. It is reported that the Soviet Union has requested that Britain and the United States provide 4 million. From this perspective, the total number of German prisoners used by the Allies reaches over 8 million.</p>
<h3>U.S. Minesweepers Lost Two Vessels</h3>

At the same time, the foreign ministers of the three countries, Eden, Byrnes, and Molotov, are drafting a new agenda for further talks, indicating that a major secret issue has been resolved." According to various speculations, this so-called "certain issue" probably concerns the handling of Germany.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 20th: The U.S., British, and Soviet three-party talks continued on the 19th, with the key issue seemingly being the handling of Germany. According to a United Press dispatch from the 18th, the discussion concerns the form of occupation of Germany for ten to twenty years. A Reuters dispatch stated that the issues under review are closely related to the future of Germany. Whether to continue the joint occupation, dissolve Germany, or allow Germans to establish a unified political organization is being intensely discussed. In addition, there are issues related to the basic German industries that affect the lives of Germans and the nation's strength. The positions of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain differ greatly, making it difficult to resolve. The current talks are of a preliminary nature. The foreign ministers of the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union are preparing to adjust and coordinate the topics for discussion, and the progress of the three-party summit will complement this.</p>
<h3>Evening Banquet Held at Temporary White House</h3>

<h3>Civic Welfare Association Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Disaster Relief, Secretary-General Luo Delivers Speech Encouraging Mutual Assistance</h3>
<p>The city suffered two enemy air raids on the 17th and 18th, resulting in a large number of innocent civilian deaths and injuries. The disaster area is in a terrible state. The municipal authorities are very concerned and hope that the public will demonstrate a spirit of mutual assistance and actively undertake relief work. To concentrate efforts, a unified organization should be formed to coordinate everything, cooperate with the city government's various relief facilities, and achieve maximum efficiency. Mr. Wen Lanting, Chairman of the Shanghai Civic Welfare Association, recognized this and, witnessing the tragedy, felt deep sympathy. Therefore, he convened a meeting of all directors at the Shen Bao building on Hankou Road yesterday afternoon. The attendees included Chairman Wen Lanting, Vice-Chairmen Li Sihao, Zhao Jinqing, Yuan Fudeng, Lin [blank], Chen Bin[blank], Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Nanqun, Pei Yunqing, Dong Shaoyi, Chen Riping, Wang Boyuan, Jin Xiongbo, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, and Secretary-General Hu Shouqi. Secretary-General Luo from the municipal government was also invited to attend and provide guidance. Secretary-General Luo delivered a speech, encouraging the public to demonstrate compassion and mutual assistance, contribute money and effort, and assist the municipal government in carrying out relief work. He emphasized that relief work must unify civilian organizations to concentrate efforts and achieve great results. Previously, the municipal government issued relief treasury bonds, with 20 million yuan designated for temporary relief. However, some relief treasury bonds have been subscribed but not fully paid. He hoped that the payments would be made as soon as possible. In addition, although the municipal government is facing severe economic difficulties, it has allocated another 10 million yuan to increase the effectiveness of relief efforts. Subsequently, discussions began, and four resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>Organize Relief Committee</p>
<p>To organize an air raid relief committee, divided into fundraising, medical, and relief groups, and nominate candidates. The resolutions were: 1. Fundraising Group: Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Jin Xiongbo, Zhu Boquan, with Yuan Ludeng as the convener. 2. Medical Group: Gu Nanqun, Xu Wanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Shen Siliang, Bao Guochang, Yan Fuqing, Pan Sansheng, Fan Huichun, Zhu Shunlin, with Gu Nanqun as the convener. 3. Relief Group: Zhao Jinqing, Xiang Kangyuan, Wu Xikun, Chen Riping, Wang Boyuan, Zhao Puchu, with Zhao Jinqing as the convener.</p>
<p>Establish Emergency Hospitals</p>
<p>To establish temporary emergency hospitals in Pudong, Puxi, Jiangwan, Xujiahui, and other places, and appoint responsible personnel. The resolutions were: First establish temporary relief hospitals in Puxi (Zhu Shunlin), Xujiahui (Pan Sansheng), and Jiangwan (Fan Huichun), and prioritize establishing shelters in Buddhist temples.</p>
<p>Urge Payment of Relief Treasury Bonds</p>
<p>Regarding urging the payment of relief treasury bonds, the resolution was: Of the temporary relief treasury bonds issued by the city, 50 million yuan was subscribed by the public. There is still 13 million yuan that has been subscribed but not paid in full or only partially paid. The deadline for full payment is one week, with no further notice. Please pay attention to the chairmen of the various associations that have not paid, and do not delay or hesitate. Wen Lanting and Li Sihao will temporarily advance the funds. 20 million yuan of treasury bonds will be allocated for air raid relief. In addition, Secretary-General Luo of the municipal government immediately approved the allocation of 10 million yuan on the spot. A temporary motion was made to raise another 10 million yuan, with Jin Xiongbo raising 2 million yuan, Shen Bao undertaking 1 million yuan, Xinwen Bao offering 1 million yuan, Xu Xiaochu and Xu Guanqun jointly undertaking 1 million yuan, Sun Yaodong raising 2 million yuan, Wen Lanting and Wang Boyuan jointly undertaking 1 million yuan, Luo [blank]Yi, Xu Changchun, and Zhang Ruitang jointly raising 2 million yuan, and Chen Shaoyi raising 1 million yuan. All payments are due to be sent to the Nanjing Industrial Bank by the 24th of this month. From today, the Xinwen Bao and Shen Bao Social Service Departments, and the Nanjing Industrial Bank, will accept donations from all sectors.</p>
<h3>Transportation Guild Notifies Members to Transport Wounded Citizens in Case of Air Raid at Any Time</h3>
<p>Recently, the city has suffered repeated air raids. The civil defense authorities have paid close attention to rescue work. Immediately after an attack, rescue personnel are dispatched to drive ambulances to the affected areas for emergency treatment. However, vehicles are often insufficient. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Cui Shifu, chairman of the city's Transportation Trade Association, to inquire whether transportation vehicles could assist in rescue work and transport wounded citizens after an attack. He replied: "This issue has already been considered, and concrete measures have been drafted. All member vehicle companies (approximately 400 vehicles in total) were notified on the 19th that in the event of an air raid, regardless of where vehicles are parked or driven, they should assist civil defense or Baojia personnel in transporting dead or injured citizens, without any excuses for refusal. In particular, managers of each vehicle company should warn drivers not to avoid transporting injured citizens on their own. In other words, in the event of an air raid, Baojia or civil defense personnel can order parked or moving transportation vehicles to assist in the task of transporting dead or injured citizens. Those who refuse without a valid reason will have their car numbers recorded and reported to the association for punishment."</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Approves New Milk Price</h3>
<p>The city's Milk Farm Association previously submitted a request to the Municipal Economic Bureau on June 30, to adjust the price of fresh milk from July 6. The bureau, considering that the previous case had been approved not long ago, did not approve it, and ordered that the original price of June 21 should still be sold, and the price increase notice issued on the 2nd should be withdrawn to all customers. Recently, the association again requested an adjustment from July 21, citing the continued increase in the price of feed materials, in order to avoid losses. After investigation by the Economic Bureau and verification of the cost sheet submitted by the association, which was found to be consistent, it has been approved to take effect from July 21. However, before that date, all customers should still pay the original price of June 21. The agreed price list is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Pasteurized Milk Grade A (tested for tuberculosis), 2-pound bottle 6640 yuan, 1-pound bottle 3360 yuan, half-pound bottle 1840 yuan. Grade A, 6320 yuan, 3200 yuan, 1760 yuan. Grade B, 6000 yuan, 3040 yuan, 1680 yuan.</p>
<p>(B) Unpasteurized Milk Grade A (tested for tuberculosis), 2-pound bottle, 5600 yuan, 1-pound bottle 2880 yuan, half-pound bottle 1600 yuan. Grade A, 5280 yuan, 2720 yuan, 1520 yuan. Grade B, 4960 yuan, 2560 yuan, 1440 yuan.</p>
<h3>Civil Defense Headquarters Convenes County and District Civil Defense Meeting</h3>

<h3>Special Court Sentences Accomplice in Case of Forcibly Extorting People's Wealth, Zhai Suozeng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>According to the reporter's inquiry from the Shanghai branch of the Special Court yesterday, the court previously approved the execution of the main criminals Li Hongxin and Du Zhiping in the case of forcibly extorting people's wealth, and the execution was carried out at the Racecourse. It is now learned that there was another accomplice in the case, Zhai Suozeng. At that time, he was hospitalized due to illness. After his recovery, he was escorted to the court for trial. The trial ended last month and was submitted to the Chairman of the National Government for approval. He was sentenced yesterday (20th) at 9:00 AM. Zhai Suozeng was sentenced to life imprisonment with a fine of 50,000 yuan for jointly intending to obtain illegal benefits, using power and coercion to extort people's property, and was deprived of public rights for life. If he is unable to pay the fine, the fine will be converted into labor service at the rate of the total amount of the fine divided by the number of days in six months. The illegal gains of 70,000 yuan will be recovered and confiscated.</p>
<p>It is noted that Zhai Suozeng was previously a police officer at the Huashan Police Branch in the city. After being laid off, he colluded with Li Hongxin, Du Zhiping, and Gu Weiliang (who are already executed or at large) at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Jiangsu Road at 5:00 AM on April 5 this year, under the guise of checking residents' permits, in an attempt to obtain illegal benefits. However, Zhai Suozeng had been laid off at the time of the crime and did not have the status of a civil servant. Therefore, the court did not sentence him to death.</p>
<h3>Hongyu Money Exchange Ordered to Suspend Business, Not Approved by Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Hongyu Money Exchange on the second floor of 105 Jiangxi Road in the city was ordered to suspend business and fined 200,000 yuan as a warning because it had not applied for registration with the Ministry of Finance, but operated without authorization, and its name was the same as that of Hongyu Money Exchange at 518 Hankou Road in the city. The Ministry of Finance investigated and consulted with the municipal government to instruct the Finance Bureau to send personnel to order the suspension of business and impose a fine of 200,000 yuan in accordance with Article 3 of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions.</p>
<h3>Silver Money Houses Extensively Provide Cash</h3>
<p>Silver money houses in the city are now extensively providing cash to customers for legitimate purposes because the Central Reserve authorities have increased the supply of cash chips. However, each household is allowed to withdraw cash each week based on the lowest deposit amount of the previous week, not exceeding 1 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Urgent Need for Scholarship Funds, Appeal to Silver Money Industry to Take the Lead</h3>
<p>It would be good to sponsor one team, even better to sponsor several teams</p>
<p>It is said that the accounts of silver money houses at the end of June showed profits for every one of the hundreds of houses. Therefore, we earnestly request that the responsible persons of the hundreds of houses on the sea come forward to support the scholarship movement, donate some scholarship funds, no matter how much, and we hope to do so as soon as possible. It would be good to sponsor one team, even better to sponsor several teams. For the houses, donating 100,000 or 200,000 yuan is not a drop in the bucket, but our scholarship fund records are indeed accumulating day by day, and we can complete the target of 30 million yuan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The scholarship movement is the most active work and the most far-reaching plan of all good deeds; it is a century-long plan for cultivating talents for the country, directly related to rescuing out-of-school children, and indirectly preparing materials for the country, cultivating valuable vitality, the reason is very clear. The reason why we earnestly hope from the silver money industry is that the silver money industry is the mother of all industries, the confluence of all streams. Once it is advocated, all industries will rise up, like the response of the mountains. We hope that the leaders of the silver money industry will not have a wait-and-see attitude, do not follow the example of looking at Yue from afar, we cannot but pray sincerely, and bow our heads to thank you on behalf of thousands of poor students!</p>

<h3>All Circles Spontaneously Sympathize with Air Raid Victims, Actively Donate and Make Further Efforts</h3>
<p>Since this city has been subjected to air raids, all sectors of society have actively promoted relief work. Since this office began collecting donations on behalf of those in need, enthusiastic people have donated one after another yesterday, like wildfire, receiving over one million in donations again. This is based entirely on the human heart of compassion, self-motivation, mutual assistance, so the amount of donations, the size of the donations, are self-evident. However, disaster victims are displaced, wandering in distress, and in need of assistance; how urgent their needs are! It depends on influential people to make greater efforts, generously donate, actively provide assistance, helping themselves and others, achieving immeasurable merit. The following are excerpts from incoming letters:</p>
<p>The entire staff of the Shilu Branch of HSBC Bank wrote: "Recently, the northeastern area of our city has been repeatedly bombed, the disaster is serious, and the displaced are miserable to witness. We are all filled with sympathy upon hearing the news. We are sending 1.5 million National Currency dollars to be used for relief expenses. We pray that this be divided and donated to the air raid disaster relief fund, 500,000 dollars each to the Pushan Villa and the China Children's Welfare Association, contributing a trickle of soil to form a mound."</p>
<p>The staff of the Pudong Electrical Business Office of Huazhong Water and Electricity Company wrote: "Our city has suffered a terrible bombing. Our staff cannot stand idly by, so we have gathered 300,000 dollars in donations, hoping you will check and forward it to the relief agencies. We know that a drop in the bucket is not enough, but we hope to gather together small things to make a big contribution."</p>
<p>Christian Churches Providing Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Christian Association, in view of wartime needs, organized a temporary relief association three months ago and divided the city into six districts, each district forming a unit. Larger churches in the districts were set up as shelters and first-aid stations, recruiting service personnel and training them in first-aid knowledge for relief purposes. On the one hand, funds are raised to pre-purchase food and firewood for use in emergencies. Recently, when the northeast area of Shanghai was bombed, many civilians were killed and injured. The district's first-aid station immediately mobilized all service personnel to go to the rescue and opened the church as a temporary shelter, which was quite effective. If the bombing situation in Shanghai expands in the future, the need for the association will be even greater, so the association has been extremely busy in recent days.</p>
<h3>Mr. Huang Jingwan Hopes for Friends' Assistance</h3>
<p>Former Director of this office, Mr. Huang Jingwan, has spared no effort in serving social, cultural, and charitable causes on a daily basis. He lived frugally and has no savings. Recently, he suddenly suffered from a toothache and was hospitalized in Antang Hospital for treatment. He has been there for almost two weeks, and he has not yet recovered. He is unable to bear the medical expenses, and it is even more difficult to maintain the livelihood of a family of several people. Although Mr. Huang's old friends, the Masters of Yuzhai and Nanzhai, and Layman Rong, have donated medical expenses, they are concerned that Mr. Huang has not yet recovered from his illness, and that he will need to continue to recuperate after his illness. His financial situation is dire. Colleagues at this office, out of sympathy, plan to ask Mr. Huang's friends to lend a helping hand by providing financial assistance, which will be collected and forwarded by this office. We would be most grateful.</p>

<h3>Authorities in This City Strengthen the Promotion of Air Raid Rescue Work, Director Noguchi and Others Talk at Press Conference</h3>
<p>The regular press conference hosted by the City Propaganda Department was held at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 20th) at the City Hall, attended by Zhou Yuying, Director of the City Social Welfare Bureau and Director of the Social Relief Department of the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, Noguchi, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters and Deputy Director of the Social Relief Department, and Gu Senqian, Director of the Propaganda Department. They spoke in detail on the necessity of strengthening air defense equipment and enhancing rescue and relief work during sudden attacks, as well as the public's desire for the Social Welfare Bureau to actively manage relief matters. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Director Gu's Speech</p>
<p>Director Gu said: In Shanghai, which is now being subjected to surprise attacks by enemy aircraft, it is imperative to actively strengthen air defense equipment to protect the lives and property of citizens. The air defense authorities have long been aware of this. As for popular relief and rescue organizations, leaders from all walks of life have spontaneously initiated organizations to respond to emergencies. Some hospitals lack humanitarianism and demand exorbitant pre-payments of cash for medical expenses from people in distress, even refusing to admit patients. The authorities attach great importance to this matter and plan to completely control all rescue and medical supplies needed by patients during air raids to meet any emergency. Regarding the issue of rescuing and providing relief to citizens injured or affected by enemy air raids, we have invited Director Zhou and Director Noguchi to report on this.</p>
<p>Welfare Bureau Director's Speech</p>
<p>Director Zhou said: What this bureau has long been paying attention to is the issue of social relief in peacetime, while the issue of social relief in emergencies is the work of the Social Relief Department of the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters. Regarding the general relief issues of the enemy air raids on Shanghai on the 17th and 18th of this month, in addition to the Social Welfare Bureau shouldering full preparation, we also hope that leaders from all walks of life will set up relief and rescue organizations as soon as possible to popularize relief work. Director Noguchi is also very concerned about this matter and will do his best to assist in promoting relief matters.</p>
<p>Director Noguchi's Speech</p>
<p>Subsequently, Noguchi said: I will briefly report to you on the rescue and relief situation during the enemy air raids on Shanghai on the 17th and 18th of this month. In the past, the Air Defense Headquarters was prepared for the possibility of enemy aircraft attacking Shanghai, so it vigorously trained members of the rescue and stretcher teams as a backup. As a result, enemy aircraft recently came and carried out indiscriminate bombing. The majority of those killed and injured were Chinese, while only a very small number were Japanese. Due to this surprise attack, the citizens of the city should pay more attention to the measures taken by the Air Defense Headquarters. During the enemy air raids, the members of the rescue and relief teams worked extremely hard, but it was still not satisfactory. The headquarters will sincerely accept all suggestions from all sides.</p>
<p>Hope for Citizen Preparation</p>
<p>Regarding the patients admitted by various private hospitals this time, the headquarters will provide the necessary medical supplies to ensure that they can proceed smoothly. If an air raid occurs south of the Suzhou River, the headquarters has also made full preparations for rescue matters. Citizens should use this experience to gain a deeper understanding of the Air Defense Headquarters' preparations for air defense. In addition, the authorities and all parties are making every effort to assist the headquarters in its work. There should be no difficulty in obtaining the necessary rescue materials, and we are absolutely responsible for supplying the necessary medical materials. However, in the event that a certain place is air-raided or multiple places are air-raided, the need for materials will be extremely urgent. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life will donate generously.</p>
<p>Hospitals Extorting Consultation Fees</p>
<p>The headquarters' rescue teams are composed of Chinese and foreign personnel and are prepared to be deployed in the future. During the previous air raid on the northeast area of Shanghai, two Hungarian expatriate doctors in the foreign air defense team voluntarily went to the rescue. It is regrettable that some hospitals actually demanded cash before providing medical treatment, which is the greatest disgrace to the medical profession. Doctors should contribute their skills to society unconditionally during this wartime, but the headquarters will prepare to reduce the materials they consume.</p>
<p>Food and Clothing, Planning Ahead</p>
<p>Under air raids, not only is there a problem of food, but clothing is also needed. I once had a plan to hope that every citizen can donate one Sheng of rice and store it in various places. By accumulating small amounts, we can achieve comprehensive relief. In the event that disaster victims in air-raided areas are in urgent need, there will be no food panic. Although people's lives are more difficult at this time, as long as citizens share this goal, even if each family donates one Sheng of rice, they can prepare for air raid food relief. As for the clothing problem, citizens can also pack their excess clothes in a bag and send them to the police station in charge for use in case clothing is needed. If there is no air raid disaster, it can be taken back. However, this headquarters does not take the initiative on these food and clothing preparations, and it is best if citizens can prepare on their own.</p>
<p>The Matter of Digging Air Raid Shelters</p>
<p>Before a considerable period of time, citizens did not understand the purpose of the headquarters' facilities. When we launched the digging of air raid shelters, many people were uncooperative. Now, in this air raid, all the citizens who hid in the air raid shelters were actually able to save their lives. From this experience, citizens should gain a deeper understanding of the importance of digging air raid shelters.</p>
<p>Setting Up First Aid Stations in Each District</p>
<p>South of the Suzhou River, 13 air defense districts will be established based on the police jurisdiction. Each district will have a team leader, and below that, there will be first-aid stations, and below the stations, there will be first-aid stretcher teams. Each district will also have surgeons and obstetricians as first-aid workers. The headquarters is now establishing five rescue teams to undertake specially assigned tasks. All municipal hospitals are basic hospitals for rescue. At the same time, we hope that citizens will pay attention to the methods of stopping bleeding for injuries. They should trust the instructions given by the authorities and should not arbitrarily apply unsterilized products, which could lead to accidental death or injury.</p>
