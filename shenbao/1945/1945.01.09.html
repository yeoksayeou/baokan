<h3>團結兩大民族　爭取最後勝利</h3>
<p>總參謀長鮑文樾談</p>
<p>南京八日中央社電　軍委會總參謀長鮑文樾，陸軍部部長葉蓬，爲國府參戰二週年發表談話如下：鮑總參謀長談話如下！</p>
<p>今天是我國民政府參加大東亞戰爭第二週年的紀念日，同時正是盟邦日本特攻隊，在菲律賓戰塲與敵人勇猛奮鬥的決定時期，今後整個大東亞民族的命運，興廢，當然要看中，日兩大民族及整個東亞人士的最後努力如何，以爲斷。在這爭取最後勝利的重大時期中，我們如能同心同德奮鬥不懈，最後勝利必屬於我，當然亳無疑義。</p>
<p>近百年來，中國被英美帝國主義蹂躪束縛，陷於殖民地的地位，日深一日，無由自拔，幸於大東亞戰爭爆發後，盟邦日本，將英美敵人在東亞百餘年的壓榨，一舉殲滅，中國得解除一切不平等條約的束縛，由次殖民地地位，一躍而爲獨立自主的國家，中華復興東亞解敖，已逐漸實現了。</p>
<p>現在大東亞戰爭已進入決勝階段，整個大東亞民族的或生或死，或存或亡，或勝或敗，所關至鉅。我全國同胞尤其陸海空軍胞，爲對英美百餘年壓榨復仇，爲感謝盟邦政府擊滅英美尤應繼續努力奉行汪故主席所昭示的「肅正思想」「增加生產」確保治安」施政方針，俾盡我們參戰國家大後方的責任，以協力盟邦爭取最後勝利。</p>
<p>陸軍部長葉蓬談話</p>
<p>葉陸軍部長談話如下：今於我國參戰二週年紀念之日，議就我軍熱烈簡素之情緒，述說要旨二項如下：</p>
<p>（一）參戰爲軍人之本願，我國自參戰以來，在物力參戰與人力參戰上，雖已盡其義務與責任，並得在物力上應與人力參戰上更加努力，以非至共同之勝利，然於戰力參戰，則尙未實現，凡我袍澤心所未安。蓋我國軍人雖盡力於後方治安之維持，而對盟邦日本軍人於各綫之洛血奮戰，則實深慚愧。且軍人作戰，原爲軍人本分，戰力參戰，實爲軍人本願，故也是我國軍人於參戰之初，即願流血合作於參戰，將來更進而作戰。</p>
<p>（二）參戰到底，爲軍人之節操，吾人鑒於羅馬尼亞，芬蘭等國於此次戰爭中，中途敗盟，實爲各該國家之恥辱，而我國之參戰，將永遠基於同生共死之義而不渝，此固爲我國上下一致之精神也。至我國軍人，則尙有我國古代武士義烈不變之傳統精神不計利害，不問成敗，旣已參戰，必參戰到底，此更余所敢斷然者也。</p>
<p>吾人本此精神勇往邁進，則明年我國參戰三週年紀念日，必爲大東亞戰爭戰勝紀念日，其振奮踴躍歡欣鼓舞，將十百倍於今日矣。</p>
<h3>京中日青少年　將舉行交歡會</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　首都靑少年興亞總奮起運動實踐會，爲團結中日靑少年，緊密聯絡提携，增進友誼起見，特定於九日下午三時，假新運會大禮堂舉行中日靑少年交歡大會，出席者中國靑少年代表五十人，日本靑少年代表四十人，共九十人，屆時幷請中日各有關機關長官曁靑少年團代表出席指導，幷有餘興。</p>
<h3>松島部長駁斥　羅斯福演辭　欺瞞國民焦慮可見</h3>
<p>羅期福總統，於本屆第七十九次議會上所發表之演辭中，曾言及太平洋作戰美軍獲得非常之成功，對此中國方面艦隊報道部長松島大佐，八日發表談話如下：</p>
<p>羅氏演詞</p>
<p>羅斯福總統於六日所開之會議上，發表演辭，細讀其中關於大東亞戰爭之部分，第一乃誇言其作戰之進展，爲有史以來最神速之機動攻擊作戰，敵軍雖能於一年間，由東馬紹爾羣島一角，進擊至西菲律賓島之雷伊泰，但僅通過海面，而取得雷伊泰之一角而已，今稱作南海要塞之東西卡羅林羣島，及拉巴爾，玻根維爾，其他如新幾內亞北邊之戰略據點，萬紹爾羣島中一部份要地，尙仍在我軍掌握中，去年九月十五日以來，派拉烏攻略，亦成爲泡影。</p>
<p>日本於大東亞戰爭之初期，以短短半年，而能收獲警人戰果，與敵機較牲絕大之生命及物量，所收獲不過是極小之戰果。</p>
<p>大言不慚</p>
<p>美軍曾誇言「到馬尼拉度聖　節到馬尼拉度聖誕節」，發此大言之美軍，只能於雷伊泰之慘澹苦戰，與明多羅島空襲下迎之矣。再則雷伊泰島美軍之作戰，誇示爲依據新的作戰計劃，此誠謊言也，實乃堅實作戰所當然之事。彼等所企圖之派拉島與哈爾馬希拉之攻略，實不過爲念求功績，而作此輕妄行動，此點余以前均已一再說明。羅氏又誇稱菲律賓海戰中，美海軍獲得偉大戰果，難道我海空軍將其艦船二百數十艘及飛機一千一百架之損害，遺忘製入統計表中耶。精銳航空母艦之大半已失，大部戰艦已葬入海底，無數人命喪生，至今於實伊泰島尙有八個師團以上之兵力，但視其結果，必遭驚人損失，因此美軍不得不變更其預定之攻略，冒險突入明多羅島。羅氏又謂：「我國民對戰綫上戰士之戰鬥力與勇氣，極堪稱讚，國民更須對其子弟，與指導美軍之幹應予稱頌。」一如此種欺瞞國民之言辭，世人能發見其錯誤耶？</p>
<p>敵美輕視戰術，單恃其物量與人力，可謂徒然浪費而已。有此重大損失，一俟美國國民發覺時，彼尙有何顏面見其父老。雖然，戰爭無犧牲不能達其目的，但須知以最小犧牲換取最大效果，方爲用兵之妙也。</p>
<p>援助重慶</p>
<p>其次，美國對援助中國之大宣傳與重慶方面相齟齬，據我等所知，由印度方面輸入之大量物賢，非爲接濟渝軍，而爲供駐渝美空軍之軍需，渝軍所到手者不滿十分之一，而只足供渝軍三個師團之給養，故重慶方面，曾言「若羅氏踐行其援助之諾言，則桂林衡陽等重要根據地，決不會遭喪失」。</p>
<p>最後，緬甸方面之作戰，羅氏稱：「英美軍對此作戰，經過無數困難，而不能突破，必須堅忍持久以赴」。此與敵美平時所誇大宣傳者相矛盾，彼對此苦戰，亦有所眞言表露矣。要者。美國之太平洋作戰，乃不完全連續之「飛石作戰」。雖得佔領菲律賓之一角，而犧牲已有數萬兵員矣，今東西應戰正酣，日美兩國之戰鬥情勢，須視今後作戰而定其果，我等見此羅氏演辭，其對國民之欺瞞態度，不難想像羅氏心中對戰局之焦慮也。</p>
<p>德方評論</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國社訊，德外部發言人昨稱；羅斯福總統致國會辭，反映羅氏第三届任期結束時之軍事經濟政治狀况之困難。羅氏承認美軍在西歐及太平洋皆受挫敗，且損失重大，且並未提及戰事之存續時間。羅氏指出須再作重大犧牲，並宣佈强制勞役之法律，已證實希特勒元首新年致辭中，所採行之方法已有效。羅氏之辭完全暴露美國並無作戰目的，美政治領袖爲貪求一已之權力，遂不惜犧牲其靑年於國外戰塲，門羅總統地下有知，亦難瞑目。羅斯福之虛偽意思，已完全暴露，因此德國與歐洲之口號，爲動員一切力量，以擊敗敵人之計劃。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>參戰的第三年</h3>
<p>我國正式宣吿參加大東亞戰爭，如今已兩年了，兩年來我們對於參戰的任務，究竟實踐到怎樣的程度呢？</p>
<p>當民國三十二年一月九日我政府聲明正式參戰之際，本報曾向當局掬誠獻言參戰以後人民所最關心而希望重視的兩點：第一是「尊重民意」，第二是「維護國力」。我們又曾鄭重地指出：根據中日兩國協力的實際需要，我國參戰的重心，不在軍事，而在政治與經濟，而在集中和發抓全國政治與經濟的力量來協助日本，完成大東亞戰爭的最後勝利。</p>
<p>去年參戰一周年之際，我們又指出參戰第二年開始後應當實踐的三大任務：第一是舉國同心，貢獻物力人力，協同盟邦作戰；第二是負起更大責任協力肅淸英美殘餘勢力，實現大東亞宣言的五大綱領；第三是修明政治，改善民生，建設統一的新中國。而欲完成這三大任務，最重要的前提，是在於南京國民政府必須做到是一個爲人民所擁護的强有力的政府——第一完成戰時政治體制，第二完成戰時經濟體制，第三完成戰時文化敎育體制。</p>
<p>誠然，兩年中我國在參加大東亞戰爭上盡過一些力量。可是仔細考察起來，離我們當初的理想，似乎太遠。論「尊重民意」，我們始終認爲民意機關的設置，是官民協力，動員民力，發揮國力的必不可少的機構。而所調「維護國力」，國力的基礎在於民，必須使以民爲基礎的國力可以用之不盡，貢獻無竭，纔是眞正維護之道。返觀今天生產衰落的情形，民生嚴重的狀况，似乎未曾盡維護之力。我們眞要爲國力的前途担憂。</p>
<p>「尊重民意」和「維護國力」之做得未臻美滿，我們覺得去年參戰一周年時所指出的「完成戰時政治體制」，「完成戰時經濟體制」，「完成戰時文化敎育體制」都沒有做到理想的完成，是重要癥結。因爲所謂「强有力」是不够「强」和不够「有力」，因此之故，政治尙難澈底修明，民生難以改善，從而無法完善地做到舉國同心，貢獻物力人力，協同盟邦作戰。</p>
<p>參戰第三年開始的今天，我們不能不再鄭重而重複地提出「尊重民意」和「維護國力」的兩大要點。</p>
<p>我國參戰的重心旣在政治與經濟，所以所謂「尊重民意」，目的即在於官民赤誠協力合作，健全而淸明的政治之下，發揮民力，培養國力，提供經濟的作戰力。今年我們要脚踏實地，不尙空虛，大家爲國忘己，力求政治的淸明，生產的切實增加。尤其要緊的，政治上必須斷然實行强化，經濟上必須有通盤計劃，側重實際上的增產工作。我們可以說：斷然强化政治，訂立具體的增產計劃，是參戰第三年開始時首先要做到的事情，這是實獻民力物力的前提。</p>
<h3>中日駢肩一致　以期必戰必勝　三品部長發表談話</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　日本總軍報道部長三品隆氏，爲中國參戰二週紀念日中，發表談話稱：盟邦中國參加大東亞解放之決戰，已滿三年，値此戰局日趨激烈之際，中國官民於悲痛汪主席逝世之餘，在陳代主席領導下，一新國民政府面目。同時並强化決戰體制，爲實現國父主義與在主席遺志，向爭取最後勝利之途勇猛邁進，此爲吾人所最敬佩者。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭今已入決戰階段，吾人從決戰情形中可　出戰爭之二個對立的性格，即道義的必勝點爭，與投機的冒險戰爭。蓋從中日兩國以觀，此戰爭均爲決定其國家命運與民族興亡之戰爭，東亞安危，繫此一戰，故爲一道義的戰爭，但從敵人英美方面而觀，戰爭之進行，一係所謂「科學的冒險」之不自量力行爲，不過爲追求「投機的利潤」而已。</p>
<p>美駐渝空軍，近且慘無人道，竟敢盲灣中國同胞，使中國人的父祖之地，化爲焦土，彼等爲追求利潤，不擇手段的作風，於此可見。至於戰時日本之姿態，已由日陸海軍時別攻擊隊隊員的勇敢而充分表現。特攻隊員搜尋敵艦之剿征姿態，實爲最眞實最純粹的日本戰時姿態，彼等悉爲靑少年，一億日本國民，悉爲彼等之兄弟姊妹，父兄叔伯，故特攻隊員之抱定決心，前仆後纔，爲完成歷史使命而含笑赴義，實即爲日本凝集一億儀民凝集民族之熱血而作戰，日本刻正從事於此。同時，中日兩國，亦駢肩作戰，以期必戰必勝。</p>
<p>敵人英美，前曾大作豪語謂，將從地球表面掠殺日本，再將桎梏加諸東亞諸民族者，不外欲使彼等國力蕩盡，每犧牲吾一億人民之熱血，然須知此實爲一不可能之事也。</p>
<p>革新的日本與革命的中國，對於欲蹂躪亞洲自由與光榮之敵人英美，將繼續作戰，雖百千年之久，亦在不惜。</p>
<h3>華北各地舉行　參戰紀念式</h3>
<p>北平七日中央社電　新民會中央總會以中國參戰二週紀念轉瞬即屈，爲喚起國民戰意，激發國民決勝意識，以貢獻心物總力於戰爭，特決定擴大舉行紀念儀式，屆期中央總會除援例舉行紀念儀式及舉　合唱會等外，並召開民衆大會，邀請情報局長管翼賢，總署宣導局長趕晋等出席講演，該會並已制定中國參戰二週年宣傳要綱，頒發各省市總會，以便屆時擴大實行，預料是日華化各地，將展開如火如荼之紀念行事。</p>
<h3>汽車牌照　改用豆製代用品</h3>
<p>美資源匱乏明證</p>
<p>中央社滬訊　頃據可靠消息：美國伊里諾州之春田城（Springfield），曾發生一怪事，近美國因製鐵原料缺乏，所有汽車牌照，均用大豆壓榨之代用品。但據發現若干汽車之牌照，均被狗吞吃，致東主無證識別其原車輛，甚至因此引起訴訟。由此足證美國資源已頻匱乏之境。</p>

<h3>呂宋島烟硝彌漫　日守軍執戈以待　特攻部隊猛炸敵機動部隊</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　呂宋島聖凡志多及仁牙因灣西方之敵軍，現再作準備登陸，其所有兵力，計特設空母六七艘，巡洋艦及驅逐艦數艘，型似運輸船約二三十艘，他方敵第二船團刻由明多羅向呂宋島航行中，此概爲敵船團之主力，以此大小運輸船約一百數十艘所構成之敵主力船團，其任務在補給仁牙因灣敵軍抑或駛向其他地點雖難豫測，然菲律賓方面之日軍，刻正嚴重監視其動向，對敵之登陸企圖，執戈以待。</p>
<p>呂宋島仁牙因前綫八日中央社電　敵護航船團六日出現於仁牙因灣（三年前日軍登陸地點），七日以艦上砲火與艦載機反覆轟炸聖凡南多，巴拉汜與達莫邇迭斯各灣岸之日軍防衛陣地，各地日軍陸地陣地亦以巨砲迎擊，雙方展開激烈砲戰。敵機動部隊距灣岸僅若干米，以類似戰艦或大型巡洋艦之巨艦爲先導，每二分鐘對海岸發射砲彈一發，漸以緩慢速度南下，一羣過後，復見一羣，砲擊繼續不斷，其後綜計七十餘艘敵艦，作單縱陣於碧藍海上，白光閃爍。日陸軍勇士則於海岸陣地嚴重警戒，某部隊長曾謂「敵軍艦來犯可與其決一死戰」，其間敵艦載機仍不斷來襲，敵巨人型與卡其斯型戰鬥機轟炸機，於日軍陣地上空盤旋不停，反覆作俯衝轟炸，或以機槍掃射，演其登陸戰之慣拔。此時可見被敵機轟炸之火光繞天，日特攻隊突入敵機動部隊正中，敵防空砲火甚爲猛烈，敵大小艦艇七十餘艘一齊開始砲擊，砲烟頓時彌漫長空，與岸上丘陵，日機於烟霧中活躍，敵艦艇則在海上狼狽逃竄，未幾自海上湧起一大火燄，此當爲日機轟沉敵艦之實證。至此，呂宋島決戰即告開始，入夜後敵亦無何動靜，灣內稍平，然各地仍有照明彈之信號，敵僅沿近海行進，以艦上砲火施以射擊，從未登陸，或係畏懼日軍防禦，日軍以敵登陸用舟艇不知何時或行接近海岸，刻正待機中。</p>
<p>日軍防衛陣　堅如鐵壁</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫某基地八日中央社電　呂宋島西岸仁牙因灣海域，出現敵大型登陸用舟艇七八十艘爲基幹，於特設空母十餘艘掩護之下，自六日晨曾侵入仁牙因灣內，自午前十一時許開始以艦上砲火射擊灣岸，其射擊重點爲該灣東北岸之聖凡南多方面，此乃敵方企圖登陸之表示。該方面日空部隊，曾於五日薄暮，以特攻隊一誠隊對之繼續施以猛炸，致使該灣內之艦船多數起火。關於日方所收戰果，已由大本營發表，唯此僅至六日傍晚，未判明者，至於該灣內之戰果，則尚未發表。今敵企圖於呂宋島登陸一點，已頗明顯，按敵於雷伊泰作戰之中途，即於明多羅島登陸，其後，並爲第三十八機動部隊爲主力之有力機動部隊，空襲台灣，冲繩，以妨碍日軍之補給，更以印度洋上英艦隊向北部蘇門答臘進攻，以牽制菲律賓作戰。敵進侵呂宋島之奢望，自入新春以來，已俞形急激，今於仁牙因灣出現故艦船羣之後，更發現後續部隊兩船團，自明多羅島南方及民答那有峨島海西進中，由此可判斷，敵確係正努力推行呂宋島之登陸作戰。現在侵入仁牙因灣之敵兵力，依敵艦船之編成觀之約爲一師內外，又於後續船團中，於明多羅島南方航行中之船團，有大小運輸船約百五十艘，似爲相當有力，於民答那峨海西進之敵船團，較此勢力稍弱。日空軍則勇敢出動，六日過午，於明多羅西方海上，痛炸敵機動部隊，確認擊傷空母三艘，此等空母初時傾斜，其後大概全數沉沒。又神風特別攻擊隊之金剛隊，六日下午七時於里　南方海上，攻擊以戰艦或大型巡洋艦，驅逐艦，護衛之運輸船約二十五艘，日機當即以俯衝戰法，炸沉中弄運輸船一艘。此外，並炸中大型巡洋艦一艘，日軍早知敵於菲律賓作戰之最大目標，在於制扼呂宋島，故當地之防衛堅如鐵壁，於此待機之日軍，一俟良機到來，亦即敵將接觸呂宋島時，日軍邀擊陣，當即壯烈迎戰，使敵軍之一大擊減。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地七日中央社電　日空軍自三日以來，猛炸侵入蘇魯海之敵機動部隊及運輸船團，五日下午五時許，日軍特別攻擊隊之一誠飛行隊及各精銳，在呂宋島上展開和所復攻擊敵機動部隊，六日已由日大本營發表，曾有一誠隊飛機三架，均壯烈拼撞於敵艦，轟沉敵空母二艘，日軍更繼續出動，刻在擴大戰果中。茲誌三日來菲律賓方面，日陸海軍航空部隊予敵損害如次：轟沉敵空母二，戰艦一，戰艦或巡洋艦二，巡洋艦一，運輸船十五，擊毀驅逐艦一，運輸船二，大型船一艘。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地八日中央社電　日航空部隊，七日晨於明多羅發見航行中之敵小型艦羣，乃低空加以轟炸，將其數艘擊毀。又是日黎明於呂宋島聖凡南多海面攻擊敵舟艇羣，亦擊毀其數艘。</p>
<h3>日陸軍閱兵禮　昨嚴肅舉行　杉山陸相特發表談話</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日陸軍本年最初之閱兵典禮，八日（大詔奉戴日）上午在日大元帥陛下親臨下，於宮城二重橋前嚴肅舉行，按八年前亦曾於此舉行閱兵典禮。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日衫山陸相於閱兵典禮完畢後，發表談話，大意如次：戰局愈益危急，決定皇國興廢之秋。我大元帥陛下，本日舉行陸軍閱兵典禮，親覽陸軍軍容。方今敵英美迭受重大打擊，而仍以執抝之　意來攻，戰局前途雖極重大，只須全軍燃起必勝之信念，勇作衝擊，則確信勝利必歸於我，我全陸軍於鐵石之團結下，與海軍渾然一體，不問前綫後方，全體將兵均作特攻精神，誓必擊滅宿敵，以安聖慮。</p>
<h3>滿高砲隊　再獲獎狀</h3>
<p>滿洲八日中央社電　一九九四四年十二月敵機兩次來襲奉天，滿洲國軍曾與日航空隊協力邀擊敵機，將其擊落數架，樹立偉大功勳，滿洲國軍高射砲隊司令　及該高射砲隊，曾受得關東防衛軍司令官所贈獎狀，此次更由軍事部邢士廉授與獎狀，高射砲隊全部將領之士氣愈爲昂揚。</p>
<h3>美法駐渝代表　定期呈遞國書</h3>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，據重慶消息：美國駐渝大使哈萊，定於星期一上午十一時呈遞國書，哈氏自去年十二月初已就任駐渝大使職。又據斯德哥爾摩訊，特戈爾之駐渝代表貝科夫將軍，定於九月九日呈遞國書</p>
<h3>洪京外圍　攻防戰熾烈　塞貝爾島鐵橋炸斷</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊：洪京激戰已有兩週，內城仍遠在德洪軍外圍防綫以內，議會大學等重要建築均在內城以內，距離戰區甚遠，但蘇長程砲之砲彈及蘇機之炸彈，仍可投射及之，洪京西部戰事，距衛城山約數公里，北部戰綫在烏日佩斯之郊外。東部之拉柯森米巴萊及基斯佩斯，亦爲激戰中心所在地。南部之克斯勒區仍在德洪軍之手。城西南部蘇軍於塞貝爾附近，已抵多瑙河西岸，塞貝爾島北之鐵橋業已炸斷。德洪軍昨繼續在東郊擊退蘇軍之猛攻，僅自動放棄爲蘇機所炸毀之大厦一所。洪京迤西之戰事，重心在凡爾特山之北費爾索迦拉與格蘭河之間，凡爾特山內之激戰，德軍力阻蘇軍向柯末恩推進。格蘭河下游蘇軍未有所行動。柯蘭方面德軍於杜勃倫之北發動攻勢，以改善其陣綫。</p>
<h3>德軍在義北　設飛彈基地</h3>
<p>沮里希八日中央社電　據前綫消息：德軍在義大利北部各地，建設V一號及V二號之發射基地，此舉不僅有加强波河平原之防衛戰，且着重於防止蘇軍突入奧斯特里俾里可掩護克羅提亞之新攻勢</p>
<h3>西綫德軍反攻　把握主動地位　南翼先鋒抵達威森堡</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊：西綫於攝氏零下十度至十五度之氣溫下進行劇戰，戰事中心在比國瑪希·斯達維洛及巴斯托納等處及亞爾薩斯北部。薩爾格米特及比許一帶，德軍續有進展，亞爾薩斯方面之美軍亦與比國方面之美軍相同，已將全部兵力參加戰事。蒙高茂萊上將統率之英美軍，在摩塞爾河與繆斯河間以坦克數百輛猛攻德軍，但無進展，德軍具有冬季作戰之裝備，堅强抵抗。德軍繼續威脅巴斯托納，美第三軍被迫退守該城東北之高地。目前反軸心軍尚未取得聯絡，而德軍於鞏固　翼後，行動自如，德軍已實現緊握主動地位之目的。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　亞爾薩斯北部德軍之反攻，現已形成確定之局面。據德軍之前綫消息稱，德軍於比希南方突入美第七軍陣地，縱深二十公里，現德軍先鋒似已抵達威森堡南方十公里之處。美第七軍曾由亞爾薩斯中部調來三師兵力，用阻德軍攻勢，然德軍復由斯特拉斯堡與哈根諾中間之芬特將夫附近，向萊茵西岸前進，結果美第七軍右翼防衛陣頓形不利，因此薩爾格米特至薩拉　間之左翼亦須後退。</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據路透社從軍記者稱：德軍於斯特拉斯堡渡過萊因河，西進約二公里半，佔據五村落。又據路透社巴黎電稱，薩爾戰綫德軍業已完全佔領文根（哈根諾西方三十四公里）</p>
<h3>對盧布林政權　英所持態度</h3>
<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　據莫斯科電：盧布林波蘭臨時政府經蘇聯政府承認後，七日任命摩列夫斯基爲駐蘇大使。</p>
<h3>三巨頭會議　地點尚守秘</h3>
<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　海通社訊：羅斯福邱吉爾與斯達林三人下次會晤之地點，雖秘而不宣，「倫敦泰晤士報」外交訪員謂所選會晤之地，決非三國政府所在地·至於議事日程最難解決之問題，當爲波蘭之糾紛，蘇聯承認盧布林臨時政府後，此項糾紛益難應付，蘇政府似不擬改變對鄧巴頓奧克斯計劃之態度。至於經濟問題中，當以伊朗油井之前途爲最要。再者三巨頭下屆會議之始，將決定特戈爾將軍是否爲參加會晤之第四人。</p>
<h3>松平部長　揭露敵美陰謀　壓迫中立國益形露骨</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所，循例於昨日下午舉行報道常會，松平報道部長及福間副領事均出席，席間由松平部長報告美國侵佔渝方航空網及把持金融情形，及美國壓迫各中立國日趨激烈態勢。茲誌之於左：</p>
<p>美國壓迫各國情形一天比一天表面化，去年間美國以渝蔣要求，召還史蒂威爾，暫時表面似乎緩和，但去年十一月以後，美國以間接射擊方法，利用報紙攻擊渝方內政，一方面用外交手段，把握渝方航空及金融。去年十一月在美國芝加哥開航空會議，英美兩國諒解渝方航空網屬於美國勢力範圍。由於去年金融會議之決定，渝方金融問題，由美國協力改善，渝方金融亦漸漸爲美國所把握矣。歐洲方面美國壓迫各中立國態度亦日見劇烈。西班牙以極端受美國壓迫，西德貿易致被美國製肘，西班牙外交政策，亦不能不加以變更。葡萄牙亦同樣受美國壓迫。最近土耳其亦以美國緊迫與日本斷絕外交關係，觀於土政府之聲明，顯然係依據美國之要求而與日本斷絕邦交，土耳其始終爲維持中立，而不斷努力，現雖在美國壓迫下與日絕交，吾人亦殊覺不勝遺憾之事，藉此亦可想見美國壓迫之强烈矣。由此觀之，美國竭力壓迫世界各中立國，目的在變更各中立國政策，各中立國也就漸漸變爲美國的屬國了。對於美國的野心，正面反對並以全力粉碎美國的國家爲日本，德國，及墨索里尼領導之意大利，共同反對美國之野望。近在太平洋方面及歐陸方面，積極作戰，予美麗以重大損失，遂使羅斯福之慾望不能實現。還有一個反對美國的國家即爲蘇聯，蘇聯反對美國獨佔航空網及其他企圖獨佔計劃。今後戰爭局面愈激烈，美國壓迫各國亦愈强化，其獨佔企圖亦愈積極，但相信另一方面防止美國野望的力量，也要抬頭，粉碎美國的力量，亦愈增强。</p>
<h3>美司令否認　駐渝空軍他調</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據倫敦電臺播稱，捷諾特少將否認美國第十四空軍隊，即將調離重慶之說。</p>
<h3>勿爲英美利用　渝方應有民族自覺　松島報導部長廣播演詞</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報導部長松島大佐，頃以中國參戰二週年，於七日下午九時半，於國際及上海兩電臺，同時以「大東亞戰爭第四年新年辭」爲題，對重慶抗戰地區，及和平地區民衆廣播。該廣播詞並由大東電臺向日僑專播，廣播詞內容如次：</p>
<p>日軍防備銅牆鐵壁</p>
<p>「大東亞戰爭第四週年之新春，余能向諸位談話，引爲欣幸。首先際此中國參戰紀念日，敬向中國官民之同生共死的協力表示感謝。太平洋方面戰爭，刻下正以菲島爲中心，臨入最熾烈之階段，美軍焦慮萬分，企圖拚死衝破菲島方面日軍陣綫，但在日軍防備如銅牆鐵壁之前依，然徒然消耗兵力而已。</p>
<p>菲島海空敵美損失</p>
<p>目去歲十月第一次菲島方面海空戰以來，已閱時二月半，其問至一月六日爲止，敵方損失計被擊沉航空母艦三十艘，戰艦五艘，戰艦或巡洋艦三艘，巡洋艦二十一艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦六艘，驅逐艦十五艘，艦類不詳者一艘，運輸船一百零七艘以上，魚雷艇二十一艘，登陸用舟艇二十艘以上，其他二艘，合計二百三十一艘以上。又被擊破者，計航空母艦二十九艘，戰艦十艘，巡洋艦二十二艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦三艘，驅逐艦七艘，艦類不詳者二十九艘，運輸船四十八艘，魚雷艇六艘，登陸用舟艇甚夥，合計一百五十四艘以上，合擊沉擊破總計達三百八十五艘以上，又飛機擊落擊毀，共計一千九百六十五架，人員損失，估計約十數萬人。然其結果從整個菲島大勢言，連戰略上無大價值之小島雷伊泰島，尚且未能奪得。又侵犯馬尼刺之前提明多羅島，雖已登陸，但受日本航空部隊之集中攻擊，今後作戰極難進展。其間敵方曾出動一部份機動部隊於臺灣東方海面，並再度空襲臺灣及琉球，竭力切斷日方對菲島之接濟路綫，另有一部份機動兵力，調往呂宋島西方海面，目一　三日以來已受到甚大損害，計航空母艦被擊沉三艘，擊破三艘，此外各種船艇被擊沉破，亦三十二艘。</p>
<p>盲目轟炸不擇手段</p>
<p>敵方此次企圖，似欲急於攻略呂宋島，在今年新春於兩軍激鬥中，踏上其第一步，同時大陸方面情勢，由於日本陸軍之奮鬥與海軍之協力，逐步佔領重要戰略要點，粉碎美軍將來作爲大陸基地，俾爲日本決戰之第一步驟。多數航空基地爲日軍獲得後，使美駐渝空軍活動大受妨碍，在此時期內，美軍惟一依賴之有效戰法，厥爲利用巨型轟炸機，空襲日本生產地帶，以减弱其生產力。再言美軍　炸及於中國人民，重慶各將領亦明瞭，尤以去年十二月十日空襲漢口以後之險惡空氣，尤爲大東亞民族所不容隱忍者，此種行爲，與標榜世界和平之美國國策，完全背道而馳，試　胡蘭成氏主持之大楚報社論，謂此次美軍空襲，實以人類爲敵，轟炸不擇目標，戰爭不擇手段，以功利上的勝利爲第一。</p>
<p>武士道精神之表現</p>
<p>歷來日本之戰爭，莫不爲武士道精神之表現。在過去歷史上，不少因兩國糧不足而戰鬥者。然此次空襲，專以對企求全面和平之中國民衆盲目轟炸爲能事，此與日前蔣先生曾說和平地區內人民亦同胞云云，完全反對。武漢地區人民對美機目爲妖魔，重慶更可說是東亞之叛逆，中國民衆之公敵，對美人目爲人類之害虫，此爲余最替重慶悲哀者。</p>
<p>美軍侵入東亞將使東亞民族，今後永久呻吟於塗炭之苦，如以上所述事實，於中日兩民族言，僅爲其前奏曲而已，但從形式上判斷，日美之決戰場已漸移向西方，此於中國決非可喜之事。憶及歐洲方面之義大利及法國現狀，以及最近大陸方面長沙之慘狀，則可想到美軍於將來決戰時，無差別的破壞手段與彼等企圖滅絕東亞民族的盎格魯撒克遜第一主義相吻合。最近據重憂及延安廣播，更能證實余之信念。但余之信念爲代表青年日本之大東亞青年理念，從未有將重慶及延安的諸位目爲敵人。</p>
<p>改善中國將來命運</p>
<p>今日余與上海許多中國友人交友，余時常對友人力言全面和平之必要，對於英美侵入中國，應拚死力加以阻止，日前有曾留學日本之某中國青年對余言：「本人希望爲日本而盡最大努力」當時余答以「否，希望君爲中國而建設大東亞」。其次再言美國之反攻，受到多大消耗，他日將引起威脅美國人生活之重大社會問題，在此狀態下，如戰爭繼續一日，則美國爲補足人力上的損失，必使中國民衆多供其犧牲，此點爲本人正竭力反對者。今年元旦日，曾聽蔣先生廣播，明悉其重點在軍事第一。然爲此而以中國的人力與物力集中於戰事，想利用中國人而作戰，對此余感到此偉大之人力及物力，不破壞中國而用於建設方面，則民衆之幸福，將如何深厚，若以中國之天地化爲決戰場則此等人力物力又將爲破壞中國而消耗，從今次長沙慘劇揣測，恢復　觀，至少需時一百年，吾人不惜以一切努力防止慘害。要之，余相信應從大局着想，以改善中國將來的命運。</p>
<p>神風精神克服困難</p>
<p>同時歐洲方面情勢最近由於德軍倫台德攻勢，而引起之情勢改變，使英美方面得到意外之結果，由此可見預言德國迅速崩潰之英美宣傳，實屬誤解，同時表明美國之物量並非屹然不敗者。德國今日處於極困難情勢下，吾人當亦已有充分認識，但如希特勒元首與宣傳部長戈培爾之宣言，德國有打破困難之偉大，吾人深信德國能改守爲攻，世界情勢，預料有驚人的輒變。日本民族不論四週情勢如何，爲完成國家使命，以神風攻擊隊之意氣，向前邁進，克服一切困難，諒亦爲蔣先生何應欽等各位所明知，於此祈念重慶官民爲中國命運，有真正的民族自覺」。</p>

<h3>今日防空日實施　局地總員訓練　第一次在黃浦分局舉行</h3>
<p>今（九）日第十三次防空日，市民防空本部循例擴大宣傳防空意義，並舉行各項防空訓練，警報訓練發令時間，業經昨報詳　，惟不吹鳴汽笛，市民當於規定時間內，按照作各項防空措置，倘聞警報鳴放，則係實在警報，市民當請注意及之。查過往對管理街頭「防空燈」尚欠妥當，於警戒警報發令時，應行點燈，空襲警報發令時，方始熄减，此當採取責任制，以奪責一人而免差誤，於訓練警報發令及解除時，亦應照上述辦法同樣辦理。</p>
<p>實施局地總員訓練</p>
<p>防空訓練實施以來，迄今已十二次，應時亦有一年之久，然仍有祗在形式上敷衍了事之處，茲爲改善起見，以後每遇訓練日，當特予指定各分局管轄之全境實施局地總員訓練，作防空上之全般配置。今日第一次在黃浦分局舉行，當時因受假想大隊敵機盲炸，所管全域各地有被炸或中彈情事，假想敵機仍繼續不斷反覆攻擊，以防害防空工作，各分局長及警防敵主任等，應在黃浦分局管內視察本演習狀况，藉作參考，防空本部應派遣視察員對左列各項予以考核。（一）器具器材之整備狀况，（二）訓練計劃之適當與否，（三）指揮之適當否，（四）狀况表演之適當與否，（五）出動狀况，（六）服裝士氣及動作，（七）待避澈底之程度，（八）訓練概評，（九）市民協力之防况，（十）其他。其他各分局之是項局地總員訓練，亦經分別規定，計第二回，泰山，盧家灣，常熟。第三回，老閘，新成。第四回，華山，長甯，徐家匯。第五回，靜安寺，江甯，普陀路。第六回，虹口，西虹口，北四川路，閘北。第七回，楊樹浦，提監橋，榆林路，新市街。第八回，邑廟，蓬萊路，斜橋。各局當實施總訓練時，應請全地域全部民衆參加，爲便利一般交通計，除一二主要幹綫，准時通行外，其他路綫悉加遮斷，並將劃定之迂迴路綫，於遮斷地口公怖之。同時不舉行前項局地總員訓練之其他各分局，亦應增加實施訓練場所，且須擴大其範圍，僅量分別舉行小單位之演練。（一概以保以下爲單位）除訓練行動外，更須記錄出動時間，特別注意訓練程度之增進，同時並應引導訓練地域之全部居民參加防空總訓練，俾今後無一人作壁上觀。</p>
<p>傳達務求迅速準備</p>
<p>今日下午二時及三時之第二次訓練警報時，假定一切通信機關均已中斷，該時接到陸海軍防空司令部之警報，立即實行連絡訓練，傳達管下各分局及有關機關，以及團體，故各分局除依照上特警命第八號派出連絡員外，應確定對管內各部份均能傳達警報之連絡班機構，依照防空本部指令，立即動員，實行最迅速而最準確之各地區傳達演習，並各分局應將其機構態勢及各地區傳達工作完了獎况及記錄其時間，俟實施後，提出報告。實施本演習時，黃浦分局應自所屬警察官或區內保甲人員中選拔適當連絡員十名，携帶脚踏車於實施一小時前，即下午一時及二時二回，各派出五名，赴防空本部聽受防空科科長之指揮。此次訓練係依照上述第二項所載，不吹鳴警報汽笛，故關於前項警報之傳達演習以外之各種警報發令及解除時間，務須樹立迅速確實，可使管內全部澈底週知之方針，此種警報之傳達，係重要之演習，目的且須預料警報汽笛損壞，及其他不鳴時之場合，銘記須有實際活用之重大意義，並施行實騐訓練，尚有其他救護消防等訓練，亦須確切認真。</p>

<h3>經濟保安處舉行　食米懇談會　五島處長出席致詞</h3>
<p>自客歲末食米暴漲後，刺激百物飛騰，市民生活咸受嚴重威脅，尤以一般薪水階級爲甚，市府經濟當局除積極研究對策外，而警察局經濟保安處，對此予以嚴密重視。茲悉該處爲宣達市府抑平物價決心，商討澈底檢舉米　對策起見，特於昨（八）日下午二時，假四馬路警察俱樂部召開食米懇談會，計出席保安警察總隊長，江灣，周家橋，北新涇，徐家匯，虹橋，真茹，大場，南翔，清河等區鎮長，及有關各警察分局長三十餘人，由五島處長福田科長親臨主持，首由五島處長致詞，略謂，查食米不但爲市民生活之重心，且爲百物價格之標準，邇來由於米價之暴漲，以致百物飛騰，市民生活所受威脅，可謂已至最嚴重階段。食米暴漲之原因固多，但一部不法軍警與奸商勾結，實爲最近米價狂漲之重大原因，例如沿途勒索，以致米販增加成本，或裏足不前，造成運輸上之困難，即其一例。經濟保安處對戰時統制經濟之執行，責任重大，今後盼望各分局長保安隊長，各鄉鎮長切實體念時艱，激發天良，抱自已爲國民一份子市民一份子之觀念。上海市物價高漲，尤以食米暴漲，人人皆受影響，人人皆有責任，務必官民打成一片，一致協力，以謀米價之平落，生活之安定。倘今後仍發現有不法警察與奸商相勾結，操縱食米，影響物價，本處當要據戰時經濟特別刑法，予以最嚴厲制裁云。旋由經濟保安處第二科福田科長致詞，申述抑平米價之決心，及辦法　詳，復由各鄉鎮長發表意見，對各區鎮宜否設市場等問題，討論良久，直至五時許始散會。</p>

<h3>本市設防空日　今日週年紀念　吳代理部長發表談話</h3>
<p>今（九）日爲中華民國參加大東亞戰爭二週紀念，　爲設立「防空日」第一週紀念日，本市市民防空本部代理部長吳頌　氏，特發表談話如下：</p>
<p>過去一年防空設施</p>
<p>「今日爲中華民國參加大東亞戰爭二週紀念日，亦適爲本市設立防空日之第一週紀念日，在此過去期間中，本市市民防空本部，曾利用每月舉行防空日之機會，提醒市民，亟須各自準備，以資應付本市或將遭敵機轟炸之危險，惟因必需物料不易獲得之故，所經計劃之各項防空設施，均未能付諸實行。但在過去一年中，本市各處，業已築造防空貯水池，各保甲辦事處，均經配給手壓帮浦，並已有防空訓練所一處，業經設立，市民防空本部現仍當繼續努力，使本市民防空設備，更　完善，關於本市有設立適當防空待　所之必要一點，則業已多次，曉告民衆矣。</p>
<p>戰局轉入決戰階段</p>
<p>戰局現已轉入決戰階段，局勢之嚴重，與日俱增，無人現能預測敵方於何時對於本市將施行大規模之轟炸，試閱報紙，即可見敵機現幾每日前來攻擊。最近敵方曾對於本國若干城市，濫施轟炸，本市亦已遭受此種轟炸三次，無辜平民慘遭犧牲，根據由此數次轟炸所得之經騐，及鑒於漢口被炸之慘酷，現已非復施行初步防空訓練之時期，一切市民對於目前之局勢，應深切了解，須知敵機之來襲，現已爲時時可能之事，倘使本市市民均能完全準備，則無論敵方對於本市施行任何大規模之轟炸，均無足懼。</p>
<p>關于此點，市民防空本部，深知亟需爲本市民衆設備充分之防空待　所，並願盡力從事此舉，一面希望每一市民，無論在家或在工作場所，均準備一遇空襲，即行設法趨　，須知暴露無蔽，危險至大，任何簡陋之掩護處所，究比毫無掩護爲佳。</p>
<p>充分貯積食糧飲水</p>
<p>其他城市因空襲而喪家者，經騐所知，將食糧與飲料水運至災區，費相當時日，故平時應貯積充分之飲食品以備急需。</p>
<p>最近敵人多用　夷彈襲擊，故應慎防大規模之火警，敵人大舉來襲時，決難預測其向何處投彈，多餘之衣服被毯，應移置安全地點，或寄存於市內他處親友家中，在現時戰爭階段，人人有準備應付空襲之必要，本市空襲業已開始，且將源源而來。</p>
<p>市民防空本部深望本市民衆注意，　從本部及各區分所之指示，同時努力訓練，切實準備，則縱被空襲，亦無足患。」</p>

<h3>怎樣負起參戰責任</h3>
<p>— 羅丁</p>
<p>今天是國府宣佈參戰二周年紀念日。冋溯汪故主席於前年參戰時曾向全國訓詞：「我們從今天起，踏入了保衛東亞的戰爭了。我們每一個人，要努力做成一個保衛東亞的鬥士……現在友邦日本的將士和國民在最前綫是如何的英勇……我們要怎樣才夠得上做他們的伙伴？」汪故主席言猶在耳，在今日戰爭酷烈局面下，我們不憚煩地必須再來檢討一回參戰的責任：</p>
<p>一、如何强化增產——去年曾提出是增產運動總動員的一年。有生產才能戰爭，誠是不移的原則。年來增產計劃，條舉目張，極盡能事；然而在現實中隨時都產生减產的現象。——物資缺乏，物價飛騰。在農村中所表示的是田園的荒蕪，種種制度的不善，人事上的剝削敲詐，賦稅的龐雜中飽……農民們每會讓去了耕牛，放下鋤頭，從事於單幫的營生；在工業上所顯現的則是原料的缺乏，原動力的减少和停止，物資配給的失當，搬運的不自由，……致使大部工廠機械廢置，坐吃山空。欲求增產，無異說夢，長此以往，不堪設想。我們今日不能不大聲疾呼：需要真正的增產！然而强化增產却不得不注意下列各點：（一）配給收買之統制機構，亟謀改善，適合民情；（二）增產應包括農業與工業，彼此互相呼應，單純的農本主義是不行的。（三）撲滅汚吏奸商土劣；確保治安。（四）維持正常生產的原料及原動力；（五）顧到生產成本，使再生產的條件不苛；（生產者較有所得，不致停業。）（六）技術改進；（七）使賦稅與貸款合理化；—消滅高利貸。（八）圓滑南北物資交換；（九）運輸機構不應有特殊性；（十）利用游散資本及勞力。</p>
<p>二、嚴厲澄清政治——其實增產的變爲减產，大部還不是爲了政治機構的不健全，致使各種適應戰時的統制經濟政策未能好好實行？既往不咎，現在需要的却是深刻的反省：如何整肅吏治？如何消滅貪汚？如何統一簡化事權。如何努力親民？都是參戰下不可或缺的勝利標的。這裏必須鄭重再行提出的：一部分行政人員尚無堅强的信念，抱着五日京兆的觀念，以爲：做官目的是撈錢；這種心理的盛行，貪汚之風那能消　？百姓因之更無完膚。此類作風，最足可殺！真是民蟲民賊之尤！要知「天視自我民視」，是非尚在人心，民心之向背真是天下最大的因果律，根據最正確的歷史觀，試看自古以來，不依民心而行的結果莫不有着最大的制裁，卽使現在如此，將來也永遠如此！后胡事件祗其一例而已。「國有常法，雖危不亡。」更切望政府有亂世用重典的決心。曹泰有云：「我輩忍十年寒，供斯民煖席；朝廷具一副淚，聞天下笑聲。」願三復斯言。</p>
<p>三、根絕投機囤貨——暴利主義者與民衆不能兩立，政府誠已明令取締，然而年來囤積居奇，操縱物資，激動物價，却是愈來愈猖獗。例如糧食和燃料價的暴漲，已使民衆沈於約望之深淵，時至今日，政府勿再猶豫，火速運用大刀闊斧的方式，予以嚴厲制裁。戰時特別刑法關於擾亂經濟條例早於前年公佈，爲保持政府威信立卽非真正强化實施不可！凡有掀風作浪投機囤積的犯罪行爲，不因有强硬背景之故，而就便宜縱容。對於「大魚」，一律處以極刑！復次，對於都市商業資本，亦應早謀出路，予以合理誘導，並應担保共安全及有利性。正常生產的煤斤電力，則萬不可省，此端盟邦方面也須深切瞭解。</p>
<p>四、切實倡導節約——在戰時體制下，理宜增其應增，節共應節。薪水階級及基本生產　，已枵腹從公，侈言節約，那是不必要的痛苦；暴利份子，酒池肉林，窮奢極慾，不强制節約，那是不必要的享受。所以要節約，先得從制裁暴利主義者着手，他們生活糜爛，全是世紀末瘋狂的病態，影響社會經濟治安匪淺。因有暴利可獲，就拼命找尋刺激；因爲生活反常，就要用大量金錢彌補，爲因爲果，以至無窮，然而老百姓苦矣！舉個例：一般「大食府」搜購糧食燃料，頓使市價大增，難道是戰時體制下的「朱門酒肉」的增產運動之一嗎？「風俗之厚薄奚自乎？繫乎一二人之心嚮而已。」誠然，過去的節約，乃是社會道德的教條，有賴有識人士的提倡，但在今日，必須予以强迫遵守，繩之以法。使暴利主義者用盡心機之餘，無法過分享受，也是一個補充的取締辦法。</p>

<p>大東亞戰爭爆發一週年後，國府汪故主席基於（同生共死）的原則，與日本携手並警惕國人，卅一年十二月主席爲與日本更進一步合作，以强化國民政府起見，東渡與日本當軸協商協力完遂戰爭及實現建設共榮圈諸問題。廿七日公畢返國。民國卅二年一月九日，國府以主席及五院院長的連署，發表對英美宣戰布告，正式參加大東亞戰爭。外交部同時以此意旨通知軸心各國政府。國府向英美宣戰後二小時，中日兩國當局爲聲明對完遂對英美共同戰爭，作全面的協力起見，特於是日上午十一時簽訂中日共同宣言。</p>

<p>六月中，行政院決議添設衛生署，處理全國衛生行政事宜。</p>
<p>另外，地方機構的調整也於參戰後逐步實行：於二次最高國防會議中，決議改善省政府組織，使省委制改爲省長制。</p>
<p>三月梢國府命令公布福建省厦門市改爲特別市；十月中漢口特別市改爲普通市。</p>
<p>在地方行政單位重行劃分上：（一）中政會於五月初通過設置江西省政府；五月底最高國防會議通過撤消蘇化行營，改設蘇北綏靖公署，原蘇北各縣歸還江蘇省政府。</p>

<p>司法行政會議</p>
<p>司法行政部爲强化全國司法組織，改善司法制度，以維治安，協力完遂戰爭起見，特於三十二年一月十一日起召開八年來未舉行的司法行政會議，討論問題爲檢察制度的改善，及縣長兼理司法的廢止等。</p>
<p>警政會議</p>
<p>國府參戰後，鞏固後方，爲當前急務。內政部爲明瞭各省市區警政實况，並改善警察機構起見，特於九月二十四日召集各省市警務高級負責人，舉行全國警政會議，討論內容爲警政之編制，人事，經費，治安，業務及訓　等。</p>

<p>三十二年一月中，中國國民黨第六屆執行委員會在京召開第五次全體會議，就戰時文化，經濟，宣傳，　訓等問題作縝密之商討，通過要案多起。</p>
<p>努力增產</p>
<p>民國三十三年元旦，汪主席訓詞中特別提出，本年是增產運動總動員一年。說：「目前國計民生最急切的需要一個是衣，一個是食，所以增產工作也就首先應該從農業輕工業着手。……政府方面要革除濫調，拿出實際方案，沈着的去做，民衆方面，也再不要袖手旁觀，搖頭太息」。</p>
<p>在全國增產的標的下，國府於一月中召開全國經濟委員會，通過各項增產案。二月九日，南京中日文化協會召開各省農業增產會議，研究關於增產諸重要問題，會中並由政府各機關負責人作重要報告，數日間製定農業增產策進綱要，以爲推進工作之準備。二月二十三日中央又召開地方行政會議，通過强化保甲及增產等要案。</p>

<p>嚴厲禁毒</p>
<p>民二十四年汪故主席在政院長任內，曾厲行禁烟，二十六年事變後中止施行，否則鴉片早已禁絕，本年二月十五日國府行政院通過禁烟辦法大綱草案，規定自三十三年二月起，限期三年禁絕鴉片。</p>
<p>整肅吏治</p>
<p>政府當局爲適應戰時體制，在政治機構上迭擬予以革新。於本年任命張　搏氏爲司法行政部長，實爲誠意延聘民間人才之表示。過去以引用官吏，未能盡善，致陷於吏治不健全之苦。會后胡案件及糧食部舞弊事發生，當局乃痛下決心，組織國民政府特別法庭。由國府公布該法庭暫行條例，並任命陳恩普爲特別法庭庭長。所有江蘇糧食局長后大椿，糧食部水產管理局長胡政，在作戰期間採辦軍糧有重大舞弊一案，即交特別法庭嚴審。經審訊終結判處后胡死刑，於三月十五日在南京執行槍決。糧食部長顧實衡，次長周乃文亦各叛徒刑十年，人心爲之一快。其次是處置上海特稅大舞弊案及米統會職員失職案，也是本年的大事。</p>
<p>整頓地方政治</p>
<p>本年國內政治中始終佔有重要地位的施政，是中央對於地方政治的努力。四月中，中央沒定撤消軍委長武漢行營，改設綏靖公署。五月二十日最高國防會議通過「省行政機構改革案」。內長梅思平氏於視案蘇省後，闡明改革省行政的意義：（一）提高行政職權；（二）撤銷三處兩局；（三）確定中央與省之關係；（四）增設行政督察專員公署。同時當局更進一步從事縣政的改革，內容着重於：（一）提高縣長地位；（二）充實縣財政：（三）保障縣政佐治人員地位；（四）重訂保甲組織法；（五）促進縣地方自治。六月中行政院復通過撤銷滬特別市所屬南匯等特別區公署一案，恢復各該縣治，並設行政督察專員分轄</p>
<p>節約戰力</p>
<p>當此大東亞戰爭愈趨酷烈之際，政府當局一方面曾强生產，一方面則從事節約運動—鼓勵民衆戰時節約儲蓄，對於整飭一般民衆奢侈之風氣，則於七月中調整消費特稅率；增加奢侈物品稅率，並改旅館筵席特稅稅率爲累進制。</p>
<p>接收義租界</p>
<p>去幾中日兩國根據中日共同宣言尊重中國主權的意趣，各地日租界已儘先交還，日在華治外法權亦經撤廢。本年七月十四日，國府實施接收天津義租界。該項協定簽訂式，由我國褚外長及義大利駐華代辦施畢納利代表兩國政府於南京簽訂。</p>
<p>溝通民意</p>
<p>在參戰過程中，因客觀的需要，政府與民衆間，非成立民意機關不可，以謀溝通上下，打成一片。上海爲全國政治，經濟，文化，教育的重心，其制度方面的得失，影響各地最鉅，而各種情形的複雜，也爲各都市之冠。經過與論界不斷呼籲，於是在本市市政當局及社會各方的協助下，本年五月一日於本市先行成立上海特別市市政諮詢委員會。所聘之諮詢委員，都爲本市夙負盛名的在野人士，如顏惠慶，李思浩，聞蘭亭，陳彬　等，一切建議，能因時制宜，待機而發，該會遂成爲唯一的爲民服務解除民瘼的民意機關。惟歷來委員會關於糧食，燃料，物價，日用品等的建議，當局以種種關係，一部分在實行上尚有所考慮。</p>
<p>勇猛邁進</p>
<p>汪故主席在日療病，不幸於十一月十日逝世噩耗傳來，全國哀痛，誠爲邦國無法補償之損失。盟邦近衛公亦云「汪主席之仙逝，國民政府似失柱石。」新領袖陳代主席於十一月二十日發布施政方針是：「凡汪主席手定之政策，皆爲公博舉行之政策；凡汪先生生前之設施，皆爲公博今日之設施。」「第一要協同日本完成大東亞戰爭，第二要促進統一和平，第三要澄清吏治，第四要繼續生產，第五要確立治安。」</p>
<p>軍政會議</p>
<p>中央爲檢討過去，改進將來，使政府人民打成一片，　遂戰爭計，於十一月二十　日在京舉行全國軍政會　。據中央社電，該會議　召開於安葬汪故主席之　日，故空氣極爲緊張肅　，各地方長官，定能仰體遺訓，遵照決議，排除萬難，强化中樞地方軍政一元化體制，勇往前進。</p>
<p>六中臨時全會</p>
<p>十一月二十五日中國國民黨在南京中央黨部舉行第六屆中央執行委員會臨時全體會議，決議發表宣言。至晚十時，大會圓滿結束，各委員星夜分返各地，加緊工作。</p>
<p>該次會議宣言之要旨，爲：表示國民黨決本以往革命精神，爲國父及汪故主席手訂之國策綱領，繼續奮鬥，以求三民主義新中國設建之完全實現。</p>
<p>各省督察會議</p>
<p>十二月五日，內政部召開首次各省市督察專員會議。該會議主要任務，在求督察專員制度之順利推行，並謀對地方治安及民政與革事項與民情，適合無間。</p>
<h3>參戰二年間我國經濟動態</h3>
<p>— 沈游</p>
<p>全經委會改組</p>
<p>民國三十二年一月九日國府參戰後，全國經濟委員會經第一次最高國防會議通過改歸國府直轄，並擴大機構，延聘華北政委會長官及在野名流參加，二月十二日召開改組後第一次全體委員會議，決議通過取消地域經濟，實施物資統制與戰時經濟政策綱領及重農等。戰時經濟政策綱領項目，列有：增加生產，調濟物價，節約消費，穩定幣制，調濟金融及改造經濟機構五大端。</p>
<p>六月二十五日，全經會又召開二次大會，通過：（一）增加農工生產；（二）貫澈物價統制，强化運輸；（三）强化國民儲蓄；　設置全國經濟調查所。</p>
<p>設立統制機構</p>
<p>民國三十二年足，所有物資統制機構潮趨完備：全國商業統制總會在滬成立，此乃商業自治性之最高物資統制機構，凡華中區物資之收購與分配，物資移動之取締核准，華中與華南北間物物交換貿易之管理，工商團體之組織，及軍需物資之採辦及各種物資價格之評定等，都爲其工作範圍。</p>
<p>商統會成立迄三十二年爲止，陸續經辦之重要工作，述要如下：</p>
<p>（一）物資移動之簽證。</p>
<p>（二）物資之登記與收買——一，小麥之收買；二，棉紗棉布之登記與收買；三，油糧之收買，四，粉　之統配；五，蛋類之統配。</p>
<p>（糧統會工作）米糧統制委員會，於三十二年十月成立，爲商統會之外圍機構。管理米糧之收買，運輸，儲藏，配給，決定價格。該會成立後辦理之工作概要：一，收買米糧工作；二，上海米糧之配給。</p>
<p>（棉統會工作）棉花統制委員會亦爲商統會之外圍機構，其職務爲：三省兩市棉花之收買與配給；中日軍需及輸出棉之供給，一般消費用棉之配給，及決定棉花價格，收買資金及物資交換之計劃，及棉花登記，搬運證之審給等。</p>
<p>政府統制機構</p>
<p>政府機構有：全國經濟委員會—決定整個經濟政策等；中央物價對策委員會及各地經濟局—決定物價，登記物資等。前述三統制委員會機構之調整及統制業務之進行，被決定於物資統制審議委員會。</p>
<p>華北物資委會</p>
<p>華北物資物價處理委員會爲華北方面之統制經濟機構，由華北政務委員會直轄。其任務爲：（一）重要物資之補充及調節；（二）重要物資平價及平衡資金之運用，（三）重要物資輸出入等之管理，（四）重要物資收買存儲，移動，交流，配給之管理事項。</p>
<p>政府物價對策</p>
<p>物價問題影響着物資的生產與分配，又關連着幣值的高低，誠爲最重要和最難解決之問題。國府對物價之飛漲，力謀有效措置：（一）獎勵儲蓄；（二）成立物價對策機關；（三）執行商品限價；（四）擴大配給品範圍；（五）取締囤積商品；（六）收買物資延期付款。</p>
<p>通貨金融對策</p>
<p>國府對於通貨與金融所採的對策，概要於下：（一）新舊幣擴大交換；（二）停止軍票新發行；（三）更改儲券聯銀匯率；（四）擴大儲券使用範圍。（五）取締敵性貨幣；（六）向日貸款；（七）整肅銀錢業。三十二年新設金融機關突增，此實爲金融畸形發展現象，其游養投機活動的危機不容忽視。當局對此的對象爲：（一）限制放款；（二）限令增資；（三）取締流期本票；（四）取締金融機關。</p>
<p>（證券交易所復業）華股交易自大東亞戰爭爆發後，成爲時勢寵兒，影響物價民生極鉅。上海當局於三十二年二三月間查對華商股票公司，令其重新整頓，始准復業；對股票經營，一律限於現貨。七月間華商證券交易所在國府援助之下正式復業。</p>
<p>（發行糧食庫券）國府因糧食問題重要及籌集米糧　買賣金，乃體行五億元糧食庫券。</p>
<p>增產運動</p>
<p>在此全國增產的目標之下，全國經濟委員會於一月中旬，召開第三次會議通過各項增產案。復次，經國府實業糧食建設三部長主持下，全國農產增產會，於二月九日在京揭幕，該會全部議案，均爲當前推進增產工作之重要課題，計分：（一）農業行政，（二）稻麥雜糧，（三）桑麻蠶絲，（四）水利林懇，（五）漁牧，（六）茶業經濟及農業技術等　在大會席上實業糧食建設各部均提出重要報告。（六）行政院成立農業增產策進委員會，對增產工作之推進方策，積極　訂規定，該會於二月中制定「增產策進綱要」，以爲推進工作準繩。</p>
<p>三月梢，中國實業協會在滬成立，作爲增產運動中的政府與人民的橋樑</p>
<p>四月中旬實業部會同上海市政府組織工商企業調查委員會，其目的在調查上海市各工商企業公司實際狀况，以謀健全組織，增加生產。</p>
<p>四月下旬中日雙方各有關團體組織棉花增產協議總會，其宗旨爲：棉花增產機關相互連絡，以圖對棉花緊急增產，有切實施策，並促進實施。</p>
<p>國府自後復表示一切施策無不以安定民生增强戰力爲目標，斷然必須實行統制經濟政策。</p>
<p>加强金融</p>
<p>國府以金融界不正當之投機，影響通貨流通非淺，爲促進全面物資及資金交流發展，於三月二十七日起，禁止經營不合理的匯兌交換，指定十一家銀行辦理華北匯兌；一方面又擴大了儲券的使用區，決定統一淮海省通貨制度。此外，更獲得盟邦的諒解，日政府堅持華幣日圓的現行匯兌換算率。於五月一日起，國府進一步的爲貫澈既定方策，促進金融圓滑發展起見，乃將南北間的匯兌限制，予以完全取消，實現各地區資金自由交流，物資交換由此可得飛躍的發展。不久，上海華北貿易委員會也在新體制下宣告　立·（中儲信用借款）中儲銀行爲强化通貨制度的健全，於三十三年八月二十五日，與日本銀行間，更簽訂四億日元信用借款，於五年內償還。（華北信用借款則爲二億元。）金融界聞訊，頗爲振奮。</p>
<p>米價狂漲</p>
<p>本年五月底政府當局曾公布「京滬兩市民食臨時措置綱要」以充裕民食，日方亦採同一方針，以期平衡供求，穩定價格。以後政令對於調節民食亦迭有修正。誠然，半年以來，日用必需品的漲風真是突飛猛晋，入於瘋狂狀態，民衆在生活上的威脅已至足以致命的地步。尤其是米糧和燃料，不可一日或缺，而高漲之盛，竟爲各生活用品的領導者。按此種週期性的上漲，在以往已司空見慣，未足爲奇，然而今番華中各地物價的上漲已不是拋物綫的上漲形態，而竟是高射砲的直衝趨勢。物價如此高昇，民衆亦日趨溝堅。此次十二月中米價的暴漲，雖由於生產未臻理想，加以戰時種種關係，治安運輸未能盡善，然而最大的　結則由人事機構上的不良，和奸商的乘火打刦所致。尤其是後者，奸商的有計劃的操縱行動，那是直接使近頃米價暴漲的原因。由此，促成一般物價莫不倍漲，金融更趨動盪；十二月中烚赤騰高數萬元，華股挺堅不　——這就是奸商們彼此呼應的技倆罷。據聞上海各有關當局及各業統制團體，對於米糧調劑供需抑平售價，設法補發戶口米等問題，均在緊急討論處治中。</p>
<p>工業黯淡</p>
<p>都市的工業因爲煤斤，電力與原料的減少，都在减產和停工的黯淡狀態中。雖然承盟邦曾陸續轉讓大批工廠來協助我們，但除去爲了軍需品生產及極少數幾家外，都有着坐食山空的現狀，連帶着逐漸激起裁撤員工的浪潮。要是不起而亟謀補救的話，此類危機，必然會更深刻。</p>

<h3>參戰二年間中日關係</h3>
<p>— 野盛</p>
<p>民國三十三年十二月八日大東亞戰爭爆發，我國民政府汪故主席當卽發表聲明，披瀝決心，願與日本同甘共苦，以渡危局。翌年十二月八日大東亞一週紀念，汪故主席復以「同生共死」勗勉國人。同月十九日更東渡日本，取得更進一步的中日合作。三十二年一月九日國府由汪故主席領銜發佈對英美宣戰佈告。中日兩國當局爲聲明互以不動搖的信念，爲完遂對英美共同戰爭，作全面的協力計，更於是日上午十一時簽訂中日共同宣言。同日中日兩國依據共同宣言的本旨，尊重中國主權的意趣，特由國民政府行政院汪院長與日本特命全權大使重光葵，簽訂交還租界太撤廢治外法權的協定，規定日本應將在華專管租界行政權儘速交還中國政府，日在華所有之治外法權速行撤廢。</p>
<p>收回各地租界</p>
<p>於是中國設立接收租界委員會，日本設立交還租界委員會。於三月三十日在杭州，漢口，蘇州，沙市，天津，福州，厦門等地的日租界，遂全部交還我國接收。三月底國府更接收北京使館區；六月五日法國亦將津漢粵三地法租界交還我國。至七月三十日，上海法租界正式移交中國政府接收。公共租界不屬單獨一國，故交涉收回較爲遲緩；厦門鼓浪嶼公共租界於五月二十八日，正式由我國全部接收竣事。上海公共租界則於八月一日由我國政府正式收回。</p>
<p>撤廢治外法權</p>
<p>日本於國府參戰日宣佈放棄在華治外法權，意·法·丹麥·西班牙亦先後宣佈放棄。日本政府決定先行撤廢課稅權，乃於七月卅一日簽訂在華日本臣民課稅條約，九月十日國府將日本國民應服從中國法令納稅的範圍首次通知谷大使。</p>
<p>中日交訪</p>
<p>（一）日本東條首相爲答謝卅一年十二月汪故主席訪日及對中國參戰表示敬意，特於卅二年三月十三日來華訪問，與國府首腦就協力完遂戰爭舉行懇談。（二）陳公博特使訪日——中樞爲日本提前交還各地租界等並撤廢物資移動限制，特於四月一日特派立法院長陳氏爲訪日專使。（三）日青木大臣訪華——青木大東亞大臣爲考察實施對華新政策後之中國情况等特於八月十九日訪華。（四）汪故主席·陳公博再度訪日—汪主席爲謀中日提携協力，關係益密，特於九月廿一日偕立法院長陳公博赴日。（五）代行政院長周佛海訪日。（六）日字垣大將於卅三年九月底訪華，考察民間實况。（七）日結城顧問於十月中訪華考察經濟。（八）日竹內次官來華觀光。（九）陳行政院長答謝日本朝野弔唁汪主席訪日。</p>
<p>中是同盟</p>
<p>中日爲求完遂戰爭，建設大東亞起見，至卅二年十月卅日，由我國府行政院汪院長與日本全權大使谷正之在南京簽訂「中日同盟條約」。前中日兩國於卄九年十一月卅日簽訂之基本關係條約卽告失效，中日間乃完全基於平等友好之關係，實行提携合作。</p>
<p>大東亞會議</p>
<p>日本爲求大東亞各國之緊甯合作，並開誠協議大東亞建設方針起見，於民國卅二年十一月五日召開大東亞會議於東京。我國政府方面由行政院汪故院長出席代表。並由副院長周佛海，外交部長褚民誼，軍事委員會陳昌祖，行政院秘書長周隆　，副秘書長薛逢元前往列席。其他參加者有日、滿、泰、緬、菲、印六國首腦。會議一致通過大東亞共同宣言，包括共存共榮，獨立親和，　揚文化，繁榮經濟，貢獻世界等五款。六日圓滿閉幕。</p>
<p>促進國民外交</p>
<p>滬上名流聞蘭亭等期與友邦增進睦誼，提高中國國際地位，俾協力完遂大東亞戰起見，乃於卅二年一月組織國民外交促進會，以爲政府外交政策決定之臂助。迭蒙政府促成，並得友邦重光大使贊助。該會宗旨爲：自主更新，促進和平，排除英美惡勢力，貫澈國父遺教，維護僑胞</p>
<p>文化溝通</p>
<p>（一）中日文化協會——該會於廿九年七月成立，是中日文化溝通的實行機關。卅二年四月該會在漢口舉行全國代表大會，通過交換中日教授學生，促進東亞文藝復興，恢復和平區大學，圖書館等。</p>
<p>（二）大東亞文學大會—八月廿五日二屆大東亞文學者大會於東京開幕，國府特派周越然，陶亢德等十六人參加出席。卅三年十一月十二日三屆大東亞文學者大會在我國南京開幕，推舉錢稻孫爲議長。</p>
<p>（三）大東亞新聞大會—日本新聞會爲完遂大東亞戰爭，展開思想戰起見，於十一月中特邀請共榮圈各國新聞代表至東京舉行第三次大東亞新聞大會，我國出度代表爲許力求·陳彬　等十四人。</p>
<p>（四）上海日本同文書院大學爲協助我國促進戰事文化，曾以日金三百萬元，捐贈我國各文化機關。我國文化界對之表示極大感奮</p>
<p>移交敵產</p>
<p>自國府還都後，日本即將舊敵產陸續交還國府管理；國府參戰後，英美等國的新敵產亦分批移交於中國方面，所有之國策公司，亦積極予以調整。另外，對於國入無主產業，則已於卅三年初全部移交。日本方面並表示：「望今後中國於接收是項移管財產後，對安定民生與完遂大東亞戰爭予以適當處置。」</p>
<p>移交廣州灣</p>
<p>卅三年三月一日華南日軍當局宣告撤除廣州灣地域之軍政，將其劃入廣東省政府治下，正式作爲和平區，由廣東省長與日軍司令官會同簽約，移歸國府管轄。</p>
<p>新策實現</p>
<p>日本政府以對華新政策爲中心，圓滑疏通各方面之特殊情形與中國政府結爲一體，日駐華大使谷正之在此目標之下，曾不辭辛苦，遍游華南北各地，並與各方面懇談，互信新政策各要案經雙方一致協力，必能獲得完滿解決。日本方面並稱爲協力建設新中國，不惜任何支援，無論中國物價糧食對策，農業增產及輕工業振興方面，決不袖手；同時希望渝方深切瞭解其誠意。總之，中日兩國爲完遂戰爭，應當付與最大努力。小倉氏就任國府最高經濟顧問後，頻與中國各界領袖交換意見，盡其翊贊發展中國經濟確保作戰資源之忱。</p>
<p>始終不變</p>
<p>日本東條內閣爲正對重大戰局，一新人心，因於七月十八日總辭職，繼任者爲小磯米內二大將，同組强力內閣，以更新姿態出現，適應此新的局面。中日政府乃共同聲明仍本過去同盟道義之精神，集中人力物力，共同向擊滅英美之途邁進，以獲取最後勝利。汪故主席復於中日締結同盟條約週年紀念日訓詞：「太平洋上接報頻傳，英美侵略東亞的武力，一天一天的削弱……我們的勝利之光，在東亞解放聲中，愈加明顯的透露出來。……我們回顧既往，當然是愈加興奮，愈加自信。」</p>
<p>汪故主席初以背部舊疾赴日醫治，在療養期內，極承日本朝野關注，復山醫藥界權威專任診治，盡近代醫藥上可能之方法加以醫療，惜竟不起。日本方面突聞噩耗，竟有悲極而出涕者，僉以主席不僅爲中國之元首，尤爲東亞之先覺。足見主席人格感召之深。主席逝世後，中樞由陳公博氏繼任代理主席。日本政府表示深切期望。小磯首相更稱陳氏之繼任，本人聞訊後爲中國民衆，爲將來之東亞全體深慶得人，爲澈底擊滅英美之侵略勢力及保衛東亞之決心，爲建設新中國，日本不惜對中國國民政府作全力之支援。陳代主席亦稱：中國國民政府決不因戰爭推移而有所動搖。中國的參戰，不止自求解放，更求大東亞各民族解放，對於本身，是出於正義與人道的，對於日本協力，也是出於正義與友誼云。</p>

<h3>Second Anniversary of the National Government's Entry into the War: Grand Commemoration Held, Capital Celebrates Extensively</h3>

<h3>Uniting the Two Great Nations to Strive for Final Victory</h3>
<p>Remarks by Chief of General Staff Bao Wen-yue</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Military Affairs Commission Chief of General Staff Bao Wen-yue and Army Minister Ye Peng made the following remarks on the occasion of the second anniversary of the National Government's entry into the war. Here are the remarks of Chief of General Staff Bao!</p>
<p>Today is the second anniversary of our National Government's entry into the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the decisive period when the Allied Japanese Special Attack Forces are fighting bravely with the enemy on the Philippine battlefield. The fate, rise, and fall of the entire Greater East Asia nation will naturally depend on the final efforts of the two great nations of China and Japan, and the entire East Asian people. In this important period of striving for final victory, if we can fight together with one heart and one mind without懈怠, final victory will undoubtedly belong to us.</p>
<p>For the past hundred years, China has been ravaged and bound by British and American imperialism, sinking deeper and deeper into a colonial status, unable to extricate itself. Fortunately, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Allied Japan annihilated the exploitation of British and American enemies in East Asia for over a hundred years in one fell swoop, and China was able to lift the shackles of all unequal treaties, leaping from a semi-colonial status to an independent and autonomous country. The revival of China and the liberation of East Asia have gradually been realized.</p>
<p>Now, the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, and the life or death, survival or extinction, victory or defeat of the entire Greater East Asia nation is of utmost importance. Our compatriots throughout the country, especially the soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, in order to avenge the oppression of British and American for over a hundred years, and to thank the Allied government for destroying the British and American, should continue to strive to implement the policy guidelines of "purifying thought," "increasing production," and "ensuring security" as proclaimed by the late Chairman Wang, so as to fulfill our responsibility as the rear area of a participating nation and to assist the Allies in striving for final victory.</p>
<p>Remarks by Army Minister Ye Peng</p>
<p>Army Minister Ye Peng made the following remarks: Today, on the anniversary of our country's entry into the war, I will discuss two key points with the passionate and simple sentiments of our army:</p>
<p>(1) Participating in the war is the duty of a soldier. Since our country's entry into the war, we have fulfilled our obligations and responsibilities in terms of material participation and manpower participation. We should strive to further improve our efforts in both material and manpower participation until we achieve a common victory. However, we have not yet realized our participation in terms of combat power, which is a source of unease for all my comrades. Although our soldiers have been doing their best to maintain security in the rear, we are deeply ashamed of the bloody battles fought by our Allied Japanese soldiers on all fronts. Moreover, fighting is originally the duty of a soldier, and participating in combat power is the duty of a soldier. Therefore, it was the wish of our soldiers from the beginning of our participation in the war to cooperate with bloodshed, and we will further fight in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Fighting to the end is the integrity of a soldier. We are aware that countries such as Romania and Finland betrayed their alliance in the middle of this war, which is a disgrace to those countries. Our country's participation in the war will be forever based on the principle of living and dying together and will never change. This is the consistent spirit of our country from top to bottom. As for our soldiers, we still have the traditional spirit of unchanging righteousness and valor of ancient Chinese warriors, who disregard gains and losses and do not ask about success or failure. Once we have entered the war, we will definitely fight to the end, which is what I can confidently assert.</p>
<p>If we move forward courageously with this spirit, then next year's third anniversary of our country's entry into the war will definitely be the anniversary of the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Its excitement, enthusiasm, joy, and inspiration will be ten or a hundred times greater than today.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Youth to Hold Friendship Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Capital Youth Revive Asia General Rising Movement Practice Association, in order to unite Sino-Japanese youth, closely connect and cooperate, and enhance friendship, has specifically scheduled a Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Meeting at 3:00 PM on the 9th in the New Movement Hall. Attendees will include 50 Chinese youth representatives and 40 Japanese youth representatives, totaling 90 people. Leaders of relevant Sino-Japanese agencies and youth corps representatives will be invited to attend and provide guidance, and there will also be entertainment.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsushima Refutes Roosevelt's Speech: Deceitful and Reveals Anxiety Towards the People</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt, in his speech to the 79th Congress, mentioned that the American military had achieved great success in the Pacific campaign. In response, Captain Matsushima of the Chinese Fleet Press Department issued the following statement on the 8th:</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Speech</p>
<p>In his speech on the 6th, President Roosevelt, after carefully reading the portion concerning the Greater East Asia War, first boasted about the progress of his operations, calling it the most rapid mobile attack operation in history. Although the enemy was able to advance from one corner of the Eastern Marshall Islands to Leyte Island in the Western Philippines in one year, they only passed through the sea and gained only one corner of Leyte. He now claims that the Eastern and Western Caroline Islands, known as the bastions of the South Sea, and Rabaul, Bougainville, and other strategic points north of New Guinea, as well as key areas in the Marshall Islands, are still in our army's control. The Palau campaign since September 15th of last year has also become a bubble.</p>
<p>Japan, in the early stages of the Greater East Asia War, was able to reap alarming results in just six months, and the enemy sacrificed tremendous lives and material resources, but the harvest was only a very small achievement.</p>
<p>Shameless Boasting</p>
<p>The American military once boasted that they would "spend Christmas in Manila." The American military, who made such boastful remarks, could only welcome it with bitter battles in Leyte and air raids on Mindoro. Furthermore, the American military's operation on Leyte Island is boasted as being based on a new operation plan, which is a blatant lie. It is actually a matter of course for solid operations. Their attempts to capture Palau and Halmahera were nothing more than reckless actions in search of merit, a point I have repeatedly made before. Roosevelt also boasted that the U.S. Navy achieved great results in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Have our naval and air forces forgotten to include the damage of 270 of their ships and 1,100 aircraft in the statistics? The majority of their elite aircraft carriers have been lost, most of their battleships have been buried in the seabed, and countless lives have been lost. Even now, there are still more than eight divisions on the island of Leyte, but judging from the results, they will suffer appalling losses. Therefore, the American military had to change its planned strategy and risk a sudden entry into Mindoro. Roosevelt also said: "Our people greatly praise the combat power and courage of the soldiers on the front lines, and the people should praise their children and the leaders who guide the U.S. military." Can the world discover the errors in such deceptive words to the people?</p>
<p>The enemy's American contempt for tactics, relying solely on its material resources and manpower, can be said to be a futile waste. When the American people discover this major loss, what face will they have to meet their elders? Although war cannot achieve its goals without sacrifice, it must be understood that the key to using troops is to exchange the greatest effect with the smallest sacrifice.</p>
<p>Assistance to Chongqing</p>
<p>Secondly, the United States' great propaganda about assistance to China is at odds with Chongqing. As far as we know, the large amount of supplies imported from India is not to supply the Chongqing army, but to supply the military needs of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. The Chongqing army receives less than one-tenth of it, which is only enough to supply three divisions of the Chongqing army. Therefore, Chongqing has said, "If Roosevelt fulfills his promise of assistance, then important bases such as Guilin and Hengyang will definitely not be lost."</p>
<p>Finally, Roosevelt said of the campaign in Burma: "The British and American armies have gone through countless difficulties in this campaign and have not been able to break through, and must be persevering and enduring to go." This contradicts the enemy's usual exaggerated propaganda, and he has also revealed some truth about this bitter fight. In short, the United States' Pacific campaign is an incomplete and discontinuous "island-hopping operation." Although it managed to occupy one corner of the Philippines, it has already sacrificed tens of thousands of soldiers. Now the battle between East and West is in full swing, and the battle situation between Japan and the United States must be determined by future operations. We see in Roosevelt's speech the attitude of deceiving the people, and it is not difficult to imagine the anxiety in Roosevelt's heart about the war situation.</p>
<p>German Commentary</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported that a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday: President Roosevelt's address to Congress reflects the difficulties of Roosevelt's military, economic, and political situation at the end of his third term. Roosevelt admitted that the U.S. military has suffered setbacks and heavy losses in both Western Europe and the Pacific, and did not mention the duration of the war. Roosevelt pointed out that further major sacrifices must be made and announced the law of forced labor, which has confirmed the effectiveness of the methods adopted by Führer Hitler in his New Year's address. Roosevelt's speech completely exposed that the United States has no war aim, and American political leaders, in order to greed for their own power, do not hesitate to sacrifice their youth on foreign battlefields. If President Monroe knew about this in the afterlife, he would not be able to rest in peace. Roosevelt's hypocrisy has been completely exposed, so the slogan of Germany and Europe is to mobilize all forces to defeat the enemy's plan.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Third Year of Participation in the War</h3>
<p>It has been two years since our country officially declared its participation in the Greater East Asia War. In the past two years, to what extent have we fulfilled our task of participating in the war?</p>
<p>When our government declared its official participation in the war on January 9, 1943, this newspaper sincerely offered two points to the authorities that the people were most concerned about and hoped to emphasize after participating in the war: first, "respect public opinion," and second, "maintain national strength." We also solemnly pointed out that, according to the actual needs of cooperation between China and Japan, the focus of our country's participation in the war is not in the military, but in politics and economics, and in concentrating and developing the national political and economic forces to assist Japan in completing the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Last year, on the first anniversary of our participation in the war, we also pointed out three major tasks that should be implemented after the start of the second year of participation in the war: first, the whole country should work together to contribute materials and manpower to cooperate with the Allies in combat; second, to take on greater responsibilities to cooperate in eliminating the remaining forces of Britain and the United States, and to realize the five major綱領 of the Greater East Asia Declaration; third, to improve politics, improve people's livelihoods, and build a unified new China. In order to complete these three major tasks, the most important prerequisite is that the Nanjing National Government must be a strong and powerful government supported by the people – first, to complete the wartime political system, second, to complete the wartime economic system, and third, to complete the wartime cultural education system.</p>
<p>Indeed, our country has exerted some effort in participating in the Greater East Asia War in the past two years. However, upon closer examination, it seems too far from our original ideals. Regarding "respecting public opinion," we have always believed that the establishment of public opinion organs is an indispensable mechanism for official-civilian cooperation, mobilizing people's strength, and leveraging national strength. As for the so-called "maintaining national strength," the foundation of national strength lies in the people, and it must be made possible for the people-based national strength to be inexhaustible and contribute endlessly. This is the true way of maintenance. Looking back at today's declining production and the severe state of people's livelihoods, it seems that the effort to maintain has not been fully exhausted. We really have to worry about the future of national strength.</p>
<p>The failure to achieve perfection in "respecting public opinion" and "maintaining national strength" makes us feel that the failure to achieve the ideal completion of "completing the wartime political system," "completing the wartime economic system," and "completing the wartime cultural education system" pointed out on the first anniversary of the war last year is an important problem. Because the so-called "strong and powerful" is not "strong" enough and not "powerful" enough, therefore, it is still difficult to thoroughly improve politics, it is difficult to improve people's livelihoods, and therefore, it is impossible to perfectly achieve the unity of the country, contribute materials and manpower, and cooperate with the Allies in combat.</p>
<p>Today, at the beginning of the third year of participation in the war, we cannot but solemnly and repeatedly propose the two major points of "respecting public opinion" and "maintaining national strength."</p>
<p>Since the focus of our country's participation in the war is in politics and economics, the so-called "respecting public opinion" aims to promote sincere cooperation between officials and people, and to leverage people's strength, cultivate national strength, and provide economic combat power under a sound and clean government. This year, we must be down-to-earth, not pursuing emptiness, and everyone must forget themselves for the sake of the country, and strive for political clarity and a substantial increase in production. Especially important, politics must be resolutely strengthened, and the economy must have a comprehensive plan, focusing on practical production increase work. We can say that resolutely strengthening politics and formulating concrete production increase plans are the first things to be done at the beginning of the third year of participation in the war, which is a prerequisite for realizing the strength of the people and materials.</p>
<h3>China and Japan Stand Shoulder to Shoulder and Work Together to Ensure Victory: Remarks by Minister Sanpin</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Sanpin Takashi, Press Minister of the Japanese General Army, issued a statement on the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, saying: Allied China has completed three years of participation in the decisive battle for the liberation of Greater East Asia. At a time when the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, Chinese officials and civilians, in the midst of mourning the passing of Chairman Wang, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, have renewed the face of the National Government. At the same time, they have strengthened the decisive battle system and are moving forward courageously on the road to winning the final victory in order to realize the Three Principles of the People and the late Chairman's legacy, which is what we admire most.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. We can see two opposing characteristics of the war from the decisive battle situation, namely, the fight for moral necessity and victory, and the speculative adventurous war. From the perspective of China and Japan, this war is a war to determine the fate of their countries and the rise and fall of their nations. The safety of East Asia depends on this battle, so it is a war of righteousness, but from the perspective of the enemy, Britain and the United States, the conduct of the war is an act of overestimating one's abilities, a so-called "scientific adventure," and is only for the pursuit of "speculative profits."</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently been inhumane, daring to blindly attack Chinese compatriots and turn the ancestral land of the Chinese people into scorched earth. Their unscrupulous style of pursuing profits is evident here. As for Japan's wartime stance, it has been fully demonstrated by the bravery of the members of the Japanese Army and Navy Special Attack Squads. The predatory posture of the Special Attack Squad members searching for enemy ships is the most real and purest wartime posture of Japan. They are all young people, and the 100 million Japanese people are all their brothers, sisters, fathers, brothers, and uncles. Therefore, the Special Attack Squad members' determination, the successive waves, and the smiling devotion to the historical mission are actually Japan's condensation of the blood of 100 million仪民 and the blood of the nation to fight. Japan is currently engaged in this. At the same time, China and Japan are also fighting shoulder to shoulder to ensure victory.</p>
<p>The enemy, Britain and the United States, once boasted that they would plunder and kill Japan from the surface of the earth, and then put shackles on the nations of East Asia, but they only want to exhaust their national strength and sacrifice the blood of our 100 million people. However, it must be known that this is an impossible thing.</p>
<p>Revolutionary Japan and revolutionary China will continue to fight against the enemy, Britain and the United States, who want to trample on the freedom and glory of Asia, even for hundreds or thousands of years.</p>
<h3>Commemoration Ceremonies Held in Various Parts of North China</h3>
<p>Beiping, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Central General Association of the New People's Association has decided to expand the commemoration ceremony because the second anniversary of China's participation in the war is approaching in an instant, in order to arouse the national fighting spirit, stimulate the national determination to win, and contribute the total power of the mind and materials to the war. In addition to holding the commemoration ceremony and holding a合唱会 as usual, the Central General Association will also convene a mass rally, inviting Director Guan Yixian of the Information Bureau and Director Gan Jin of the General Administration Propaganda Bureau to attend and give speeches. The association has also formulated the Propaganda Outline for the Second Anniversary of China's Participation in the War, and distributed it to the General Associations of each province and city for implementation at the time. It is expected that the commemorative events will be launched enthusiastically in various parts of China on that day.</p>
<h3>Car License Plates Changed to Use Soybean Substitutes</h3>
<p>Clear Proof of U.S. Resource Depletion</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency – According to reliable sources: A strange thing happened in Springfield, Illinois, USA. Recently, due to the lack of iron-making raw materials in the United States, all car license plates are made of soybean-pressed substitutes. However, it has been found that some car license plates have been swallowed by dogs, causing the owners to have no proof to identify their original vehicles, and even causing lawsuits. This proves that the United States is in a state of frequent resource depletion.</p>
<h3>Announcement of the Results of the Condor Praise Song Solicitation</h3>
<p>The case of soliciting praise songs for the Condor, which was previously solicited by the Shanghai News United Association, has been taken over by the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association. The association has now selected and determined the winners in accordance with Article 6 of the original method, and announced the winners as follows: First place: Li Hanying, second place: Xie Junwei, third place: Zhou Aijiang. The prizes of 10,000 yuan for the first place, 5,000 yuan for the second place, and 1,000 yuan for the third place will be issued at the association at No. 160 Great Shanghai Road every day from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM starting from January 15th.

<h3>Fierce Fighting on Luzon Island: Japanese Garrison Awaits with Weapons; Special Attack Units Bomb Enemy Mobile Forces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces west of Santo Tomas and Lingayen Gulf on Luzon Island are preparing to land again. Their total strength includes six or seven special aircraft carriers, several cruisers and destroyers, and approximately twenty or thirty ships resembling transport vessels. Separately, the enemy's second convoy is sailing from Mindoro toward Luzon Island, which is believed to be the main force of the enemy convoy. It is difficult to predict whether the mission of this main enemy convoy, composed of about one hundred and several tens of large and small transport ships, is to supply the enemy forces in Lingayen Gulf or to sail to other locations. However, the Japanese army in the Philippines is closely monitoring their movements, awaiting with weapons to counter the enemy's landing attempts.</p>
<p>Lingayen Front, Luzon Island, 8th (Central News Agency) – An enemy escort convoy appeared in Lingayen Gulf on the 6th (the site of the Japanese army's landing three years ago). On the 7th, they repeatedly bombarded the Japanese defense positions along the coasts of San Fernando, Balaoan, and Damortis with naval artillery and carrier-based aircraft. Japanese land forces in various locations also returned fire with heavy artillery, resulting in fierce artillery battles. The enemy's mobile forces were only meters from the shore, led by massive ships resembling battleships or large cruisers. They fired one shell at the coast every two minutes, slowly moving south. After one group passed, another group appeared, continuing the bombardment incessantly. Subsequently, a total of more than seventy enemy ships formed a single column on the azure sea, their flashes of white light shimmering. Japanese army soldiers maintained a strict watch at the coastal positions. A certain unit commander declared, "If enemy warships invade, we will fight to the death." Meanwhile, enemy carrier-based aircraft continued to attack, with giant-type and Curtiss-type fighters and bombers circling continuously above the Japanese army's positions, repeatedly conducting dive bombings or strafing with machine guns, performing their customary landing warfare tactics. At this time, flames from the enemy aircraft bombings could be seen filling the sky. Japanese special attack units penetrated the center of the enemy mobile forces, encountering intense enemy anti-aircraft fire. More than seventy enemy ships of all sizes simultaneously began firing, instantly filling the sky and hills on the shore with smoke. Japanese aircraft maneuvered actively in the smoke, while enemy vessels fled in disarray on the sea. Before long, a large flame erupted from the sea, which was clear evidence that Japanese aircraft had sunk an enemy ship. Thus, the decisive battle for Luzon Island has begun. After nightfall, the enemy showed no further movements, and the gulf was somewhat calm. However, signal flares were still seen in various locations. The enemy only moved along the coast, firing from their ships, but did not attempt to land, perhaps fearing the Japanese defenses. The Japanese army is awaiting the approach of enemy landing craft at any moment, and is currently standing by.</p>
<p>Japanese Defense Array: Solid as Iron</p>
<p>A certain base on the Philippine Front, 8th (Central News Agency) – Approximately seventy or eighty large landing craft, protected by more than ten special aircraft carriers, belonging to the enemy invaded Lingayen Gulf from the morning of the 6th. From around 11:00 AM, they began to bombard the coast with naval artillery, focusing on the San Fernando area on the northeast coast of the gulf, indicating the enemy's intent to land. On the 5th, the Japanese air force in the area had continued fierce bombing with the Special Attack Unit, the Makoto Unit, causing most of the ships in the gulf to catch fire. The results of the Japanese side's battles have been announced by the Imperial Headquarters, but this only covers until the evening of the 6th, and unconfirmed battle results within the gulf have not yet been announced. The enemy's attempt to land on Luzon Island is now quite evident. Following their operation in Leyte, the enemy landed on Mindoro Island. Subsequently, a powerful mobile force, with the 38th Mobile Force as its main component, launched air raids on Taiwan and Okinawa to disrupt Japanese supply lines. Furthermore, a British fleet in the Indian Ocean attacked northern Sumatra to constrain the Philippine operation. The enemy's desire to invade Luzon Island has grown increasingly urgent since the beginning of the new year. After a fleet of enemy ships appeared in Lingayen Gulf, two subsequent convoys were discovered advancing from south of Mindoro Island and west of Mindanao Island. This indicates that the enemy is indeed making a concerted effort to carry out the landing operation on Luzon Island. Based on the composition of the enemy ships that have now invaded Lingayen Gulf, their troop strength is estimated to be around a division. Moreover, among the subsequent convoys, the convoy sailing south of Mindoro Island has approximately one hundred and fifty large and small transport ships, which appears to be a considerable force, while the enemy convoy advancing west of Mindanao Island is slightly weaker. The Japanese air force bravely launched sorties. On the afternoon of the 6th, they heavily bombed the enemy mobile forces west of Mindoro, confirming the damaging of three aircraft carriers. These aircraft carriers initially listed, and were likely all sunk. Furthermore, the Kongo Unit of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force attacked approximately twenty-five transport ships, escorted by battleships or large cruisers, destroyers, and escorts, south of Rio at 7:00 PM on the 6th. Japanese aircraft immediately used dive-bombing tactics, sinking one medium-sized transport ship and hitting one large cruiser. The Japanese military has long recognized that the enemy's greatest objective in the Philippine operation is to control Luzon Island. Therefore, local defenses are as solid as iron. The Japanese troops waiting here will, as soon as a good opportunity arises – that is, when the enemy makes contact with Luzon Island – launch a fierce counterattack, inflicting significant losses on the enemy forces.</p>
<p>A Philippine Base, 7th (Central News Agency) – Since the 3rd, the Japanese air force has been heavily bombing enemy mobile forces and transport convoys invading the Sulu Sea. Around 5:00 PM on the 5th, the Makoto Air Corps of the Japanese special attack units and various elite forces launched a combined attack on the enemy mobile forces over Luzon Island, which was announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 6th. It was reported that three Makoto Unit aircraft crashed valiantly into enemy ships, sinking two enemy aircraft carriers. The Japanese army continues to deploy and is expanding the results of the battle. The following is a record of the damage inflicted on the enemy by the Japanese army and navy air forces in the Philippines over the past three days: enemy aircraft carriers sunk: 2; battleships: 1; battleships or cruisers: 2; cruisers: 1; transport ships: 15; destroyers damaged: 1; transport ships: 2; large ships: 1.</p>
<p>A Philippine Base, 8th (Central News Agency) – On the morning of the 7th, the Japanese air force discovered a small enemy fleet sailing off Mindoro and carried out low-altitude bombing, destroying several of them. Also, at dawn on the same day, they attacked enemy boat groups off San Fernando on Luzon Island, destroying several of them as well.</p>
<h3>Imperial Japanese Army Parade Solemnly Held Yesterday; Army Minister Sugiyama Issues Special Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Army's first parade of this year was solemnly held at the Nijubashi Bridge in front of the Imperial Palace on the morning of the 8th (Day of Carrying the Great Imperial Edict), with His Majesty the Emperor present. A parade was also held here eight years ago.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – After the parade, Army Minister Sugiyama issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: The war situation is becoming increasingly critical, and the fate of the Empire hangs in the balance. His Majesty the Emperor held an army parade today and personally inspected the army's military strength. Even though the enemy, Britain and America, have suffered significant blows, they continue to attack with stubborn intent. Although the future of the war situation is extremely critical, as long as the entire army ignites the belief in certain victory and bravely launches attacks, we are certain that victory will be ours. The entire army, united like iron, will work seamlessly with the navy. Regardless of the front or the rear, all officers and soldiers will act with a special attack spirit, vowing to destroy the enemy and put the Emperor's mind at ease.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo Anti-Aircraft Unit Receives Another Citation</h3>
<p>Manchuria, 8th (Central News Agency) – In December 1944, when enemy aircraft attacked Fengtian twice, the Manchukuo army cooperated with the Japanese air force to intercept the enemy aircraft, shooting down several and achieving great meritorious service. The commander of the Manchukuo army's anti-aircraft artillery unit and the unit itself received citations from the commander of the Kwantung Defense Army. This time, Xing Shilian of the Military Affairs Department presented another citation, further boosting the morale of all officers and soldiers of the anti-aircraft artillery unit.</p>
<h3>US and French Representatives in Chongqing to Present Credentials on Schedule</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency, citing sources in Chongqing: US Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, is scheduled to present his credentials at 11:00 AM on Monday. Mr. Hurley assumed his post as Ambassador to Chongqing in early December last year. According to reports from Stockholm, General Bécoff, the representative of de Gaulle in Chongqing, is scheduled to present his credentials on September 9th.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Around Budapest; Széchenyi Chain Bridge Destroyed</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency reports: Intense fighting in Budapest has been ongoing for two weeks. The inner city is still far within the outer defense lines of the German-Hungarian forces. Important buildings such as the Parliament and the University are all within the inner city, far from the war zone. However, shells from Soviet long-range artillery and bombs from Soviet aircraft can still reach them. The fighting west of Budapest is approximately several kilometers from Castle Hill. The northern front is in the outskirts of Újpest. Rakoscsaba and Kispest in the east are also centers of intense fighting. The Kislak district in the south remains in the hands of the German-Hungarian forces. Southwest of the city, Soviet forces near Csepel Island have reached the west bank of the Danube. The railway bridge north of Csepel Island has been destroyed. Yesterday, the German-Hungarian forces continued to repel fierce Soviet attacks in the eastern suburbs, only voluntarily abandoning a large building destroyed by Soviet aircraft. The focus of the fighting west of Budapest is between the hills of Vértes and the Gran River, north of Székesfehérvár. The German forces are working hard to prevent the Soviet forces from advancing towards Komárom. There has been no Soviet activity downstream of the Gran River. In the Komárom area, the German forces launched an offensive north of Dobolya to improve their lines.</p>
<h3>German Forces Establish Missile Bases in Northern Italy</h3>
<p>Zurich, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line reports: German forces are constructing V-1 and V-2 launch sites throughout northern Italy. This move not only strengthens the defense of the Po Valley but also focuses on preventing Soviet forces from breaking through Austria and covering new offensives in Croatia.</p>
<h3>German Forces Counterattack on the Western Front, Seizing the Initiative; Advance Units Reach Wissembourg on the Southern Flank</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency reports: Fierce fighting continues on the Western Front in temperatures ranging from -10 to -15 degrees Celsius. The center of the fighting is in areas such as Marche-en-Famenne, Stavelot, and Bastogne in Belgium, as well as northern Alsace. The German forces have continued to make progress around Saargemünd and Bitche. Like the American forces in Belgium, the American forces in Alsace have committed all their troops to the fighting. The British and American forces, led by General Montgomery, launched a fierce attack on the German forces with hundreds of tanks between the Moselle and Meuse rivers, but made no progress. The German forces, equipped for winter warfare, are putting up strong resistance. The German forces continue to threaten Bastogne, and the US Third Army has been forced to retreat to the high ground northeast of the city. Currently, the Allied forces have not established contact, while the German forces, after consolidating their flanks, are moving freely. The German forces have achieved their goal of seizing the initiative.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German counteroffensive in northern Alsace has now taken definite shape. According to reports from the German front lines, the German forces have broken through the US Seventh Army's positions south of Bitche, penetrating 20 kilometers deep. It now appears that the German vanguard has reached a point ten kilometers south of Wissembourg. The US Seventh Army deployed three divisions from central Alsace to halt the German offensive. However, the German forces also advanced from near Finstingen, between Strasbourg and Hagenau, towards the west bank of the Rhine, resulting in the US Seventh Army's right flank defense becoming unfavorable. As a result, the left flank between Saargemünd and Saaralben is also forced to retreat.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters correspondents: German forces have crossed the Rhine River near Strasbourg, advancing approximately 2.5 kilometers westward and occupying five villages. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, German forces on the Saar front have completely occupied Wingen (34 kilometers west of Hagenau).</p>
<h3>British Stance on the Lublin Government</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Moscow: Following the Soviet government's recognition of the Lublin Polish Provisional Government, it appointed Morevski as its ambassador to the Soviet Union on the 7th.</p>
<h3>Location of the Three-Power Conference Remains Secret</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency reports: The location of the next meeting between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin remains a secret. A diplomatic correspondent for the London Times stated that the selected meeting location will not be in the capital of any of the three countries. The most difficult issue on the agenda will be the Polish dispute. The Soviet Union's recognition of the Lublin Provisional Government has made this dispute even more difficult to resolve. The Soviet government does not seem inclined to change its attitude towards the Dumbarton Oaks plan. As for economic issues, the future of Iranian oil fields will be the most important. Furthermore, at the beginning of the next Three-Power Conference, a decision will be made as to whether General de Gaulle will be the fourth participant.</p>
<h3>Director Matsudaira Exposes Enemy American Conspiracy; Increasing Oppression of Neutral Nations Becomes More Obvious</h3>
<p>As usual, the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held a regular press conference yesterday afternoon. Director Matsudaira of the Information Department and Deputy Consul Fukuma were both in attendance. During the session, Director Matsudaira reported on the American seizure of Chongqing's air network and control of its finances, as well as the increasingly intense American pressure on neutral nations. A record of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>The American pressure on various countries is becoming more and more overt day by day. Last year, at the request of Chongqing and Chiang, Stillwell was recalled, temporarily seeming to ease tensions on the surface. However, after November of last year, the United States used indirect methods of attack, using newspapers to criticize Chongqing's internal affairs. Simultaneously, through diplomatic means, they seized control of Chongqing's aviation and finances. At the aviation conference held in Chicago last November, Britain and the United States agreed that Chongqing's air network would fall within the American sphere of influence. Due to the decisions of last year's financial conference, the American government assisted Chongqing with its financial problems, gradually seizing control of Chongqing's finances. In Europe, American pressure on various neutral nations has become increasingly intense. Spain is under extreme pressure from the United States, with its trade with Germany being restricted by the United States. Spain's foreign policy is also forced to change. Portugal is similarly pressured by the United States. Recently, Turkey, under pressure from the United States, severed diplomatic relations with Japan. According to the Turkish government's statement, the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan was clearly based on American demands. Turkey has always striven to maintain neutrality, and we deeply regret that it has severed relations with Japan under American pressure. This also illustrates the intensity of American pressure. In view of this, the United States is doing everything in its power to put pressure on the neutral nations of the world, with the aim of changing their policies. These neutral nations are gradually becoming American dependencies. The nations that are opposing America's ambitions head on and trying with all their might to crush them are Japan, Germany, and Mussolini's Italy, all of whom are jointly opposing America's ambitions. Recently, active warfare has been waged in the Pacific and in Europe, inflicting significant losses on America and preventing Roosevelt's desires from being realized. Another country that opposes America is the Soviet Union, which opposes America's monopoly of aviation networks and other attempts at monopoly. In the future, as the war situation intensifies, American pressure on various countries will also intensify, and its attempts to monopolize will become more active. However, we believe that the forces preventing American ambitions will also rise, and the forces crushing America will also grow stronger.</p>
<h3>US Commander Denies Transfer of Air Force Stationed in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency, citing London radio broadcasts, Major General Chennault denied claims that the US 14th Air Force is about to be transferred away from Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Do Not Be Utilized by Britain and America: Chongqing Should Have National Self-Awareness: Broadcast Speech by Songdao, Head of the Reporting Department</h3>
<p>Colonel Songdao, head of the reporting department of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, on the occasion of the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, broadcast a speech to the people in the Chongqing resistance area and the peace area, simultaneously from the international and Shanghai radio stations at 9:30 PM on the 7th, entitled "New Year's Message for the Fourth Year of the Greater East Asia War." The broadcast was also broadcast exclusively to Japanese residents by the Greater East Asia Radio Station. The content of the broadcast is as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Army's Impregnable Defenses</p>
<p>"At the dawn of the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War, I am delighted to be able to speak to you all. First, on this anniversary of China's participation in the war, I extend my gratitude to the officials and people of China for their cooperation in life and death. The war in the Pacific is currently centered on the Philippines and is entering its most intense stage. The American forces are extremely anxious and are attempting to break through the Japanese lines in the Philippines at all costs. However, against the Japanese army's impregnable defenses, they are merely wasting their forces.</p>
<p>American Losses in Philippine Sea and Air</p>
<p>Since the first Philippine sea and air battle in October of last year, two and a half months have passed. Up to January 6th, the enemy's losses have been calculated as follows: 30 aircraft carriers sunk, 5 battleships, 3 battleships or cruisers, 21 cruisers, 6 cruisers or destroyers, 15 destroyers, 1 unidentified type of warship, more than 107 transport ships, 21 torpedo boats, more than 20 landing craft, and 2 others, totaling more than 231 vessels. Furthermore, 29 aircraft carriers, 10 battleships, 22 cruisers, 3 cruisers or destroyers, 7 destroyers, 29 unidentified types of warships, 48 transport ships, 6 torpedo boats, and many landing craft were damaged, totaling more than 154 vessels. The combined total of sunk and damaged vessels reaches more than 385. Additionally, 1,965 aircraft were shot down or destroyed, and personnel losses are estimated at approximately tens of thousands. However, as a result, from the overall perspective of the Philippines, even the small island of Leyte, which has no great strategic value, has not been captured. Although Mindoro Island, the stepping stone to invading Manila, has been landed upon, it is under concentrated attack by Japanese air forces, making further progress extremely difficult. During this time, the enemy dispatched a portion of its mobile forces to the sea east of Taiwan and again launched air raids on Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands, attempting to cut off Japan's supply lines to the Philippines. Another portion of its mobile forces was transferred to the sea west of Luzon Island, and since January 13th, it has suffered significant damage, including three aircraft carriers sunk and three damaged. In addition, 32 various types of vessels were sunk or damaged.</p>
<p>Blind Bombing Without Regard for Consequences</p>
<p>The enemy's current intention seems to be to urgently conquer Luzon Island, taking the first step in the new year through fierce battles between the two armies. At the same time, on the mainland front, due to the efforts of the Japanese army and the cooperation of the navy, important strategic points are being gradually occupied, crushing the American army's future use of the mainland as a base, serving as the first step in Japan's decisive battle. After the Japanese army obtained a majority of air bases, the activities of the American air force stationed in Chongqing were greatly hampered. During this period, the only effective tactic the American army relied on was to use large bombers to attack Japanese production areas, in order to weaken its production capacity. Furthermore, the fact that American bombing extends to the Chinese people is understood by the generals in Chongqing. Especially the ominous atmosphere after the bombing of Hankou on December 10th of last year is intolerable to the people of the Greater East Asia region. This kind of behavior is completely contrary to the American national policy of advocating world peace. The editorial of the Da Chu Newspaper, led by Hu Lancheng, stated that this American air raid is truly hostile to humanity, bombing without selecting targets, and waging war without selecting means, prioritizing utilitarian victory.</p>
<p>Manifestation of the Bushido Spirit</p>
<p>Throughout history, Japan's wars have all been manifestations of the Bushido spirit. In the past, many battles were fought due to a shortage of food for both countries. However, this time, the air raids specialize in blindly bombing the Chinese people who seek overall peace, which is completely contrary to Mr. Chiang's recent statement that the people in the peace area are also compatriots. The people in the Wuhan area regard American aircraft as demons, and Chongqing can be said to be a traitor to East Asia and a public enemy of the Chinese people. Regarding Americans as pests of humanity is what I am most saddened about for Chongqing.</p>
<p>The American army's invasion of East Asia will cause the people of East Asia to forever groan in misery. As the facts stated above, for the Chinese and Japanese nations, are merely a prelude. However, judging from the situation, the decisive battle between Japan and the United States is gradually shifting westward, which is by no means a welcome thing for China. Recalling the current situation in Italy and France in Europe, as well as the recent tragic situation in Changsha on the mainland, one can imagine that the American army's indiscriminate destructive means during the future decisive battle will coincide with their Anglo-Saxon firstism, which aims to exterminate the East Asian people. Recent broadcasts from Chongqing and Yan'an further confirm my belief. But my belief, representing the Greater East Asia youth ideal of young Japan, has never regarded the people in Chongqing and Yan'an as enemies.</p>
<p>Improve China's Future Destiny</p>
<p>Today, I am friends with many Chinese friends in Shanghai. I often tell my friends the necessity of overall peace. We should spare no effort to prevent Britain and America from invading China. Recently, a certain Chinese youth who had studied in Japan said to me, "I hope to do my best for Japan." At that time, I replied, "No, I hope you will build Greater East Asia for China." Furthermore, the American counterattack has suffered so much consumption that it will cause serious social problems that threaten the lives of Americans in the future. In this state, if the war continues for one day, America will inevitably make the Chinese people sacrifice more in order to make up for the loss of manpower, which is what I am trying my best to oppose. On New Year's Day this year, I listened to Mr. Chiang's broadcast, which clearly indicated that military affairs are the priority. However, to concentrate China's manpower and material resources on the war for this purpose, wanting to use the Chinese people to fight, I feel that if this great manpower and material resources are used for construction instead of destroying China, how profound the happiness of the people will be. If China's land is transformed into a decisive battlefield, then this manpower and material resources will be consumed to destroy China. Judging from the recent tragedy in Changsha, recovery will take at least 100 years. We will spare no effort to prevent tragedies. In short, I believe that we should think from the overall perspective to improve China's future destiny.</p>
<p>Kamikaze Spirit Overcomes Difficulties</p>
<p>At the same time, the recent change in the situation in Europe due to the German army's Rundstedt offensive has brought unexpected results to Britain and America. This shows that the British and American propaganda predicting the rapid collapse of Germany is a misunderstanding, and it also shows that America's material strength is not invincible. We are fully aware that Germany is currently in an extremely difficult situation, but as stated in the declarations of Hitler and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Germany has the greatness to overcome difficulties. We firmly believe that Germany can change from defense to offense, and the world situation is expected to undergo amazing changes. Regardless of the situation around them, the Japanese people will advance forward with the spirit of the Kamikaze attack隊 to accomplish the nation's mission and overcome all difficulties. I believe that Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, He Yingqin, and others are aware of this. Here, I pray that the officials and people of Chongqing will have true national self-awareness for the destiny of China."</p>

<h3>Air Defense Day Implemented Today: Local General Training: First Time Held at the Huangpu Sub-Bureau</h3>
<p>Today (the 9th) is the 13th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, as usual, will expand publicity on the significance of air defense and conduct various air defense training exercises. The alarm training issuance time has been detailed in yesterday's newspaper. However, sirens will not be sounded. Citizens should take various air defense measures within the specified time. If an alarm sounds, it is a real alarm, and citizens should pay attention to it. It has been found that the management of street "air defense lights" has not been adequate in the past. Lights should be turned on when a warning alarm is issued and dimmed when an air raid alarm is issued. This should be done through a responsibility system, assigning responsibility to one person to avoid errors. The same method should be used when issuing and canceling training alarms.</p>
<p>Implementation of Local General Training</p>
<p>Air defense training has been implemented twelve times so far, lasting for a year. However, there are still places where things are done perfunctorily. In order to improve this, a designated area under the jurisdiction of each sub-bureau will be specified for local general training on each training day, making general arrangements for air defense. The first training is being held in the Huangpu Sub-Bureau today. At that time, due to the imagined blind bombing by a large enemy aircraft squadron, bombing or shelling was assumed to have occurred in various parts of the jurisdiction. The simulated enemy aircraft continued to attack repeatedly to disrupt air defense work. Each sub-bureau chief and chief of police defense should inspect the situation of this exercise in the Huangpu Sub-Bureau jurisdiction for reference. The Air Defense Headquarters should send inspectors to assess the following items: (1) Status of equipment and materials preparation; (2) Appropriateness of the training plan; (3) Appropriateness of command; (4) Appropriateness of situation performance; (5) Status of mobilization; (6) Appearance, morale, and actions; (7) Thoroughness of evacuation; (8) General evaluation of training; (9) Status of citizen cooperation; (10) Others. The local general training for other sub-bureaus has also been separately specified, including: Round 2: Taishan, Lujiawan, Changshu; Round 3: Laozha, Xincheng; Round 4: Huashan, Changning, Xujiahui; Round 5: Jing'an Temple, Jiangning, Putuo Road; Round 6: Hongkou, West Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Zhabei; Round 7: Yangshupu, Tijianqiao, Yulin Road, Xinshijie; Round 8: Yimiao, Penglai Road, Xiejiao. When each sub-bureau conducts general training, it should invite all residents in the entire area to participate. To facilitate general transportation, except for one or two main lines, which will be open on time, all other lines will be blocked, and the designated detour routes will be announced at the blockade points. At the same time, other sub-bureaus that are not conducting the aforementioned local general training should increase the number of training locations and expand their scope, and conduct small-unit drills as much as possible (generally using "bao" 保 as the unit). In addition to training actions, the mobilization time should also be recorded, and special attention should be paid to improving the level of training. At the same time, all residents in the training area should be guided to participate in the general air defense training so that no one will remain a bystander in the future.</p>
<p>Swift and Prepared Communication</p>
<p>During the second training alarm at 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM today, it is assumed that all communication agencies have been interrupted. Upon receiving the alarm from the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters at that time, a communication training exercise will be carried out immediately, communicating to all sub-bureaus under its jurisdiction, relevant agencies, and organizations. Therefore, in addition to dispatching liaison personnel in accordance with the Special Police Order No. 8, each sub-bureau should determine a liaison team structure capable of communicating alarms to all parts of its jurisdiction and immediately mobilize in accordance with the instructions of the Air Defense Headquarters to conduct the fastest and most accurate communication drills in various areas. Each sub-bureau should report its organizational structure, the status of completed communication work in various areas, and record the time after implementation. When implementing this exercise, the Huangpu Sub-Bureau should select ten appropriate liaison personnel from among its police officers or "bao-jia" 保甲 personnel in the district, bring bicycles, and go to the Air Defense Headquarters to receive the command of the chief of the Air Defense Section one hour before the implementation, which is at 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM for two rounds, sending five people each time. This training is based on item 2 mentioned above, without sounding the alarm siren. Therefore, for various alarm issuance and cancellation times other than the aforementioned alarm communication exercise, it is necessary to establish a rapid and reliable approach to ensure that the entire jurisdiction is thoroughly informed. This type of alarm communication is an important exercise, and its purpose is to anticipate situations where the alarm siren is damaged or does not sound. It is important to remember that it has significant practical applications and should be practiced and trained. In addition, rescue and firefighting training should also be conducted meticulously and seriously.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the New Association Holds War Participation Speech: Deputy President Chen Riping Gives the Speech</h3>
<p>Today is the second anniversary of the National Government's entry into the war. At this decisive stage, it is even more important to arouse the nation's soaring fighting spirit, devote all efforts to cooperate in the war, and strive for the final victory. In view of this, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association has scheduled a speech to celebrate the second anniversary of the National Government's entry into the war at the Grand Guangming Theater at 5:00 PM this afternoon. Mr. Chen Riping, deputy president of the Xinwen Bao, has been invited to give the speech. After the speech, war films and Huaying's famous film "Hero and Beauty" will be shown.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Sets Fee Standards for Schools</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau previously received an order from the Municipal Government to approve the Ministry of Education's request to set fee standards for public and private primary and secondary schools for the next semester. A draft plan was drawn up in early December of last year and reported to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Education. It is now known that the public and private primary and secondary school fee standards have been approved and implemented. The interim standards for the treatment of teachers and staff and the collection of student fees in private primary and secondary schools are excerpted below: (1) Private primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and equivalent schools (hereinafter referred to as "schools") in this city should pay the salaries of teachers and staff and collect student fees in accordance with these standards from the second semester of the 33rd academic year (i.e., from February 1945). (2) The salaries paid to teachers and staff and the student fees collected by schools should be calculated in terms of Central Reserve Bank notes. (3) The salaries paid to full-time teachers and staff by schools, if calculated on a monthly basis, should be calculated on the basis of six full months per semester. (4) The salaries paid to teachers and staff by schools should not be less than 70% of the total tuition revenue, excluding rent, and should be paid monthly without delay. (5) The amount of student fees collected by schools each semester should be determined based on the fee collection situation of the previous semester and the economic conditions of the majority of student families, but the maximum should not exceed the provisions of these standards (a list of regulations is below). (6) Schools that provide boarding and meals for students should organize a meal committee to be responsible for handling the meals.

<h3>Economic Security Office Holds Food Rice Symposium, Director Goshima Attends and Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Since the sharp rise in rice prices at the end of last year, it has stimulated soaring prices of all goods, and the lives of citizens have been seriously threatened, especially the general salaried class. In addition to actively studying countermeasures, the city government's economic authorities, and the Economic Security Office of the Police Bureau, have paid close attention to this. It is reported that in order to convey the city government's determination to suppress prices and to discuss thorough measures to investigate rice hoarding, the office specially convened a rice symposium at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 8th) at the Police Club on Fourth Road. More than 30 people attended, including the commander of the Security Police Corps, the district chiefs of Jiangwan, Zhoujiaqiao, Beixinjing, Xujiahui, Hongqiao, Zhenru, Dachang, Nanxiang, and Qinghe, as well as the relevant police station chiefs. Director Goshima and Section Chief Fukuda personally presided over the meeting. Director Goshima delivered a speech, stating, "Rice is not only the focus of citizens' lives, but also the standard for prices of all goods. Recently, due to the sharp rise in rice prices, the prices of all goods have soared, and the threat to citizens' lives can be said to have reached the most serious stage. There are many reasons for the sharp rise in rice prices, but the collusion between some illegal military police and unscrupulous merchants is a major reason for the recent surge in rice prices. For example, extortion along the way increases the cost for rice merchants, or they stop and do not move forward, creating difficulties in transportation, which is one example. The Economic Security Office has a heavy responsibility for the implementation of wartime controlled economy. In the future, I hope that all police station chiefs, security team leaders, and township chiefs will truly understand the difficulties of the times, inspire their conscience, and embrace the concept that they are a member of the nation and a member of the citizens. The high prices in Shanghai, especially the sharp rise in rice prices, affect everyone, and everyone has a responsibility. We must unite officials and people to work together to seek a fall in rice prices and stability in life. If illegal police officers and unscrupulous merchants are still found to be colluding to manipulate rice and affect prices in the future, this office will impose the most severe sanctions in accordance with the Wartime Economic Special Criminal Law." Then, Fukuda, the section chief of the Second Section of the Economic Security Office, delivered a speech, stating the determination to suppress rice prices and the specific methods in detail. After that, the township chiefs expressed their opinions, and they discussed for a long time whether or not markets should be set up in various districts and towns, until the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Reader's Aid to Education News, "Sending Charcoal in the Snow" Becomes a Praised Story</h3>
<p>Silver Wedding Anniversary Gift Aids Education</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was raining and foggy, with cold air and muddy roads, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk. Mr. Jinian Yi personally came to the newspaper office and generously donated more than 210,000 yuan to form a "Silver Wedding Anniversary Team." Mr. Ji is honest and sincere, and kind-hearted. Sending charcoal in the snow is exactly the beautiful act that the ancients referred to. Comparing the past with the present, it seems similar. It is said that this time, the "Silver Wedding" anniversary gifts from relatives and friends totaled more than 400,000 yuan, not including gifts. From this, it can be seen that he has a wide range of social interactions and a strong friendship. He himself did not move a penny of this money, but transferred it to help the Shen Bao and Xin Bao loan scholarships, making a generous donation and showing admirable enthusiasm. The beneficiaries are of course grateful to tears. In these end times, people's hearts are not as ancient, and once they become rich, family turmoil is bound to occur, abandoning the old and welcoming the new is regarded as commonplace. Mr. Ji strives to move upward, and the couple has a deep affection, which becomes even stronger in old age, with a "I am sober while everyone is drunk" mentality, which is also worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Silver Wedding Anniversary Gift Aids Education</p>
<p>A letter from relatives and friends of Mr. Jinian Yi says: "Dear Sir, on January 1st, we happily celebrated the silver wedding of Mr. Jinian Yi and Ms. Peiying. We and others presented money as a gift to show our friendship. Mr. Ji, sympathizing with the difficulties of the times, repeatedly declined, but the anniversary gifts given by relatives and friends were sent one after another, making it impossible to refuse. We now wish to donate this sum of money, totaling 430,400 yuan, to the scholarship fund, with the Shen Bao and Xin Bao each accounting for half, named the 'Silver Wedding Anniversary Team,' to create blessings for all relatives and friends. We are sending the list of names, hoping that you will publish it as a blessing."</p>
<p>Benefit Performance Tickets Sold Separately</p>
<p>Since students from various universities launched a benefit performance of "Wealthy Life" in response to this newspaper's scholarship fund, they have been actively promoting it.

The performance tickets are divided into two types: honorary tickets and ordinary tickets. Those who donate more than 10,000 yuan will be given an honorary ticket, and the titles of the donors will be published in this newspaper every day. Ordinary tickets are divided into three types: 2,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 500 yuan, and the names will not be published separately. It is hoped that students from major secondary schools and enthusiastic people from the society will assist in the process. We are extremely grateful. Yesterday, students from Fudan University took the lead in handing over more than 50,000 yuan in honorary ticket funds. The titles of the sponsors are announced as follows:</p>

<h3>Chen Lianbo Dies in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Lianbo, former Chairman of the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, Head of the Merchant Corps, Chinese Manager of HSBC, Hong Kong tycoon, and Chief Representative of the Hong Kong Chinese People's Representative Conference, died in Hong Kong on the 24th of last month.

<h3>Bank Stops Payment of Negotiable Instruments, Handled in Accordance with Industry Regulations</h3>
<p>In recent years, the number of banks in Shanghai has gradually increased to more than two hundred, and their business conditions vary. It is difficult to maintain consistent progress. There are many banks that operate prudently, but a few banks also have uneven practices, and from time to time, banks stop payment on the negotiable instruments they issued this year. In view of this, the Joint Reserve of the Bank Association has specifically suggested that each bank handle the payment of stopped negotiable instruments and send the stopped amount to the association for safekeeping to show credibility. At the same time, in order to strictly implement it, the Bank Association recently notified all member banks to follow suit. According to the provisions of Article 24 of the banking industry regulations, "When a bank-issued draft, promissory note, or check, or an accepted draft, is lost, destroyed, or obtained by someone through illegal means, the issuer should prepare an application form, state the reasons to the bank, report the loss and stop payment, and the bank may order it to be published in two or more designated daily newspapers for three days each to declare it invalid. At the same time, the issuer and a guarantor recognized by the bank should carefully prepare a letter of guarantee. After two months, if there are no disputes, the payment will be made."</p>
<h3>Turning Point in Postal Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>In order to demand higher treatment to maintain the minimum wartime living conditions, the postal workers of this city formed a go-slow state of all employees starting from the day before yesterday. It is reported that after Wen Lanting and others took office as mediators, there has been a turning point in the situation. Their original telegram to the Minister of Construction is as follows: "Fu Minister of the Nanjing Construction Department: The strike of Shanghai postal workers is expanding, and the impact on the city's commercial finance is not small. We and others could not bear to stand idly by, and worked hard to mediate. In view of the temporary relief and postal rate increase, we are particularly responsible for asking the authorities to adopt it. On the one hand, we advised them to resume work immediately and guaranteed it with our personal credibility. We have already expressed our acceptance, and there has been a turning point. We specially telegraph the ministry to ask you to consider the difficult situation of the employees and quickly approve it so as to maintain credibility and manage the group. We are extremely eager to await orders. Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Lin Kanghou kowtow together."</p>

The final battle for the championship will be between Iwamoto, the Japanese welterweight champion, and Tandi, the Polish veteran who has won hundreds of battles. The title of the All-China Welterweight Champion will be decided by this battle. It is still remembered that Fukuda, the invincible Japanese boxing king, came to Shanghai and won repeatedly, but unfortunately, he was defeated by Tandi. Tandi was once frustrated by Iwamoto, so Tandi wants to avenge his previous defeat, and Iwamoto intends to avenge Fukuda. When the two meet, they will definitely fight to the death. The battle between the dragon and the tiger will definitely be a fierce battle. Boxing matches in this city have not been held for eight months. This time, the lineup has been carefully selected and is extremely exciting. Li Peigen, a young and strong Chinese, is brave and promising. He once knocked down a Russian expatriate and will definitely have a better performance. The competition time has been changed to 10:00 AM due to air defense relations, so that the audience can enter. Tickets will go on sale on January 10th.</p>

<h3>Air Defense Day Established in This City, Today's Anniversary, Acting Minister Wu Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Today (the 9th) is the second anniversary of the Republic of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the first anniversary of the establishment of "Air Defense Day". Mr. Wu Songqing, Acting Minister of the Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city, delivered a speech as follows:</p>
<p>Air Defense Facilities in the Past Year</p>
<p>"Today is the second anniversary of the Republic of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the first anniversary of the establishment of Air Defense Day in this city. During this past period, the Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city has used the opportunity of holding Air Defense Day every month to remind citizens that they urgently need to prepare themselves to cope with the danger of this city being bombed by enemy aircraft. However, because the necessary materials are not easy to obtain, the various air defense facilities that have been planned have not been put into practice. But in the past year, air defense water storage ponds have been built in various parts of this city, and each Baojia office has been allocated hand-pressed pumps. In addition, there is one air defense training center that has been established. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters is still continuing to work hard to make the air defense equipment of this city even more perfect. Regarding the need for this city to establish appropriate air defense shelters, the public has been informed many times.</p>
<p>War Situation Enters Decisive Stage</p>
<p>The war situation has now entered a decisive stage, and the severity of the situation is increasing day by day. No one can predict when the enemy will carry out large-scale bombing of this city. Reading the newspapers, it can be seen that enemy aircraft are now coming to attack almost every day. Recently, the enemy has indiscriminately bombed some cities in this country, and this city has also suffered this kind of bombing three times, with innocent civilians tragically sacrificed. Based on the experience gained from these bombings and in view of the tragic bombing of Hankou, it is no longer the time to carry out preliminary air defense training. All citizens should have a deep understanding of the current situation. It must be known that enemy aircraft attacks are now possible at any time. If the citizens of this city can be fully prepared, then there is nothing to fear no matter what large-scale bombing the enemy carries out on this city.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, the Civil Air Defense Headquarters deeply knows that it is urgently necessary to equip the citizens of this city with sufficient air defense shelters and is willing to do its best to engage in this effort. On the one hand, it hopes that every citizen, whether at home or in the workplace, will prepare to find a way to hide immediately in the event of an air raid. It must be known that exposure without cover is extremely dangerous. Any simple shelter is better than no shelter at all.</p>
<p>Fully Store Food and Drinking Water</p>
<p>According to the experience of those who have lost their homes due to air raids in other cities, it takes a considerable amount of time to transport food and drinking water to the disaster areas. Therefore, sufficient food and drinking water should be stored at ordinary times for emergency needs.</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy has mostly used incendiary bombs to attack, so large-scale fires should be carefully prevented. When the enemy launches a large-scale attack, it is difficult to predict where they will drop bombs. Surplus clothing and blankets should be moved to a safe location or stored in the homes of relatives and friends elsewhere in the city. In the current stage of the war, everyone needs to be prepared to cope with air raids. Air raids in this city have already begun and will continue to come.</p>
<p>The Civil Air Defense Headquarters deeply hopes that the citizens of this city will pay attention and follow the instructions of the headquarters and various district sub-offices. At the same time, they should work hard to train and make practical preparations, so that even if they are attacked by air, there will be nothing to fear."</p>

<p>Special Issue Commemorating the Second Anniversary of China's Participation in the War</p>
<h3>How to Take on the Responsibility of Participating in the War</h3>
<p>— Luo Ding</p>
<p>Today is the second anniversary of the National Government's announcement of participation in the war. Looking back on the speech that the late Chairman Wang gave to the whole country when he participated in the war two years ago: "From today, we have stepped into the war to defend East Asia. Each of us must strive to become a fighter to defend East Asia... Now, how brave are the soldiers and citizens of the friendly country Japan on the front lines... How can we be worthy of being their partners?" The words of the late Chairman Wang are still in my ears. In today's fierce war situation, we must not be afraid of being annoyed and must review the responsibility of participating in the war:</p>
<p>1.  How to Strengthen Increased Production - Last year, it was proposed that it was a year of total mobilization for the increased production movement. It is an unshakable principle that one can only wage war with production. In recent years, the plans for increased production have been listed in detail, doing everything possible; however, in reality, the phenomenon of reduced production occurs at any time. - Lack of supplies, soaring prices. What is expressed in the countryside is the desolation of the fields, the imperfections of various systems, the exploitation and extortion of personnel, and the complexity and embezzlement of taxes... Farmers often let go of their cattle, put down their hoes, and engage in single-handed business; what is manifested in industry is the lack of raw materials, the reduction and cessation of motive power, the improper allocation of materials, and the lack of freedom of transportation... resulting in the abandonment of most factory machinery and sitting idle. To seek increased production is no different from talking in a dream. If this continues, it will be unbearable to imagine. We cannot but shout loudly today: real increased production is needed! However, strengthening increased production has to pay attention to the following points: (1) The control mechanism for allocation and purchase should be improved as soon as possible to suit the feelings of the people; (2) Increased production should include agriculture and industry, echoing each other, and pure agrarianism is not feasible; (3) Suppress corrupt officials, unscrupulous merchants, and local tyrants; ensure public security; (4) Maintain the raw materials and motive power for normal production; (5) Take into account the cost of production, so that the conditions for reproduction are not harsh; (Producers should have more income so that they will not stop operating.) (6) Technical improvement; (7) Rationalize taxes and loans;—eliminate usury. (8) Smooth the exchange of materials between the north and the south; (9) Transportation agencies should not have any particularity; (10) Utilize scattered capital and labor.</p>
<p>2.  Severely Clarify Politics - In fact, the transformation of increased production into reduced production is mostly not because of the unsound political institutions, which makes it impossible to properly implement various wartime controlled economic policies? Forgiving the past, what is needed now is a deep reflection: how to rectify officialdom? How to eliminate corruption? How to unify and simplify power? How to strive to be close to the people? These are all indispensable victory targets under the participation in the war. What must be solemnly proposed again here: some administrative personnel still lack strong beliefs, holding the concept of a five-day magistrate, thinking that: the purpose of being an official is to make money; with the prevalence of this psychology, how can the wind of corruption be eliminated? As a result, the people have no intact skin. This kind of behavior is the most punishable! They are truly the worst pests and thieves of the people! It must be known that "Heaven sees as the people see," right and wrong are still in people's hearts, and the people's hearts are truly the greatest law of cause and effect in the world. According to the most correct historical view, look at the results of not following the people's hearts since ancient times, and there are always the greatest sanctions. Even if it is like this now, it will always be like this in the future! The Hou Hu incident is just one example. "The country has permanent laws, and it will not perish even if it is in danger." I hope that the government will have the determination to use severe punishments in troubled times. Cao Tai said: "We endured ten years of cold to provide warm seats for the people; the court had a face full of tears, hearing the laughter of the world." I wish to reiterate these words.</p>
<p>3.  Eradicate Speculation and Hoarding - Profiteers cannot coexist with the people. The government has already explicitly banned them; however, in recent years, hoarding and manipulating materials to stimulate prices has become more and more rampant. For example, the soaring prices of food and fuel have plunged the people into the abyss of despair. Today, the government must not hesitate any longer and quickly use drastic methods to severely sanction them. The Special Criminal Law for Wartime regarding regulations disrupting the economy was promulgated as early as two years ago. In order to maintain the government's prestige, it must be truly strengthened and implemented immediately! Any criminal behavior of stirring up trouble, speculating, and hoarding will not be easily tolerated because of strong backing. All "big fish" will be punished with the death penalty! Furthermore, a way out should be sought for urban commercial capital as soon as possible, give it rational guidance, and guarantee its safety and profitability. The normal production of coal and electricity must not be saved, and the allied countries must also deeply understand this.</p>
<p>4.  Earnestly Advocate Thrift - Under the wartime system, it is appropriate to increase what should be increased and save what should be saved. It is unnecessary pain to talk about thrift for the salaried class and basic producers who are already serving the public on an empty stomach; it is unnecessary enjoyment for profiteers who indulge in wine pools, meat forests, and extreme luxury without forced thrift. Therefore, in order to be thrifty, one must first start by sanctioning profiteers. Their extravagant lives are all a crazy pathological state at the end of the century, which has a great impact on social economic security. Because there are huge profits to be made, they desperately seek stimulation; because life is abnormal, they have to use a lot of money to make up for it. Cause and effect go on infinitely, but the people suffer! To give an example: the general "big restaurants" search for food and fuel, which suddenly increases the market price. Is this one of the increased production movements of "vermilion gates and wine and meat" under the wartime system? "What does the thickness of customs depend on? It depends on the hearts of one or two people." Indeed, in the past, thrift was a social moral code that relied on the promotion of knowledgeable people, but today, it must be enforced and punished by law. Making it impossible for profiteers to enjoy themselves excessively after exhausting all their efforts is also a supplementary banning method.</p>
<h3>Political Developments in Our Nation During Two Years of War Participation</h3>
<p>— Fei Lizhi</p>
<p>The Course of War Participation</p>
<p>One year after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the late Chairman Wang of the National Government, based on the principle of "sharing life and death," joined hands with Japan and warned the people of the country. In December of the 31st year (of the Republic), the Chairman, in order to further cooperate with Japan and strengthen the National Government, went to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese authorities on issues such as cooperating to complete the war and realizing the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. He returned home on the 27th after completing his mission. On January 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), the National Government, with the joint signatures of the Chairman and the heads of the five Yuan (branches of government), issued a declaration of war against Britain and the United States, formally participating in the Greater East Asia War. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs simultaneously notified the governments of the Axis powers of this intention. Two hours after the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, the Chinese and Japanese authorities, in order to declare their comprehensive cooperation in completing the common war against Britain and the United States, specially signed the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration at 11:00 AM that morning.</p>
<p>Preparation for Wartime System</p>
<p>The Central Political Committee simultaneously resolved to establish the Supreme National Defense Council, which could suspend the effect of existing laws and omit statutory procedures for draft laws before submitting them to the National Government for promulgation. This conference brought together central figures in the political sphere, so that military and political liaison could be tightened and made more organic. At the same time, it was decided that the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee must also participate, and when necessary, local military and political leaders could also participate, in order to achieve an organic connection between the central government and local areas. The first National Defense Conference after the war participation decided to reorganize the Executive Yuan first and then seek reform of the local political system in order to strengthen wartime administrative efficiency and achieve administrative simplification: (1) The National Economic Committee and the New People's Movement Promotion Committee, which were under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, were transferred to the direct jurisdiction of the National Government. (2) The Ministry of Personnel under the Examination Yuan was transferred to the Executive Yuan. (3) The Social Movement Guidance Committee and the Relief Committee were merged into the Ministry of Social Welfare. (4) The Food Management Committee was changed to the Ministry of Food. (5) The Water Conservancy Committee and the Ministry of Communications were merged into the Ministry of Construction. (6) The Frontier and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committees were changed to the Frontier Affairs Bureau and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, each directly under the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>On February 8th, the Japanese government issued a statement on the transfer of new enemy property. The Executive Yuan then decided the next day to establish an Enemy Property Management Committee to handle the takeover of enemy property.</p>
<p>In mid-June, the Executive Yuan decided to add a Department of Health to handle national health administration affairs.</p>
<p>In addition, the adjustment of local institutions was gradually implemented after the war participation: at the Second Supreme National Defense Conference, it was decided to improve the organization of provincial governments and change the provincial committee system to a provincial governor system.</p>
<p>At the end of March, the National Government ordered the promulgation of the change of Xiamen City, Fujian Province, to a special municipality; in mid-October, Hankou Special Municipality was changed to an ordinary municipality.</p>
<p>Regarding the re-division of local administrative units: (1) The Central Political Committee passed the establishment of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in early May; at the end of May, the Supreme National Defense Conference approved the abolition of the Suhua Headquarters and the establishment of the Subei Pacification Commissioner's Office. The original counties in northern Jiangsu were returned to the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
<p>In mid-November of the same year, the Central Political Committee decided to reorganize the important institutions of the North China Political Affairs Committee: (1) abolish the two positions of Political Secretary and establish three offices of General Affairs, Internal Affairs, and Finance; (2) the six General Offices of Internal Affairs, Public Security, Education, Finance, Industry, and Construction were reorganized into five General Offices of Public Security, Economy, Agriculture, Education, and Public Works.</p>
<p>Central-Local Tightening</p>
<p>On January 10th of the 32nd year (1943), the Executive Yuan convened a national conference of senior local administrative officials, such as the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, provincial governors, mayors of special municipalities, and commanders of special zone headquarters, to discuss the central and local wartime administrative strategies after the war participation: (1) how to increase production and strengthen public security in wartime economy; (2) how to promote the New People's Movement and implement general mobilization of spirit in wartime public propaganda and training. At the same time, the North China Political Affairs Committee held multiple conferences of provincial and municipal leaders in order to agree on the completion of the North China decisive battle system and various policies such as food prices, and to clarify the government's determination.</p>
<p>North China Centralization</p>
<p>The first Supreme National Defense Conference of the National Government resolved to transfer the organizations of the "New Movement" and "National Economy" committees from the Executive Yuan to the direct jurisdiction of the National Government, and the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee also participated as vice chairman. At the same time, the Second Plenary Agreement Conference of the North China New People's Association, convened in mid-January, in addition to issuing a declaration to protect the National Government's war participation policy, also elected the late Chairman Wang as the honorary chairman of the association. Following the abolition of additional markings on the national flag by the National Government, the North China Political Affairs Committee also banned the use of the Five-Colored Flag from February 9th; and in order to establish close contact with the central government, a liaison office was specially established in Nanjing in early July.</p>
<p>Judicial and Administrative Conference</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the national judicial organization, improve the judicial system, maintain public security, and cooperate in completing the war, the Ministry of Justice and Administration specially convened a judicial and administrative conference, which had not been held for eight years, starting on January 11th of the 32nd year (1943), to discuss issues such as the improvement of the procuratorial system and the abolition of county magistrates concurrently administering justice.</p>
<p>Police Administration Conference</p>
<p>After the National Government's war participation, consolidating the rear was an urgent task. In order to understand the actual situation of police administration in various provinces, municipalities, and districts, and to improve the police organization, the Ministry of Interior specially convened senior police officials from various provinces and cities on September 24th to hold a national police administration conference to discuss the organization, personnel, funding, public security, business, and training of police administration.</p>
<p>Health Administration Conference</p>
<p>On November 5th, the National Government's Department of Health convened the First National Health Administration Conference. Discussed items such as health administration, pharmaceutical management, public health, health education, prevention of epidemics, health insurance, travel hygiene, and health statistics.</p>
<p>Promote New Movement</p>
<p>On January 13th, the National Government convened a New Movement Promotion Conference to review the actual situation of the New Movement promotion in various places, to discuss this year's promotion plan, and to implement the General Mobilization of National Spirit. The late Chairman Wang delivered an earnest speech.</p>
<p>Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<p>In mid-January of the 32nd year (1943), the Sixth Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang convened its Fifth Plenary Session in Nanjing, discussing wartime culture, economy, propaganda, and training in detail, and passing many important cases.</p>
<p>Efforts to Increase Production</p>
<p>In his New Year's Day address in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), Chairman Wang specifically pointed out that this year is the year of general mobilization for the production increase movement. He said: "At present, the most urgent needs of the national economy and people's livelihood are clothing and food, so production increase work should start with agriculture and light industry first... The government should eliminate empty talk, come up with practical plans, and work calmly. The people should also no longer stand idly by, shaking their heads and sighing."</p>
<p>Under the national goal of increasing production, the National Government convened the National Economic Committee in mid-January and passed various production increase proposals. On February 9th, the Nanjing Sino-Japanese Cultural Association convened an agricultural production increase conference in various provinces to study important issues concerning production increase. At the meeting, responsible persons from various government agencies made important reports. Within a few days, an outline for promoting agricultural production increase was formulated as a preparation for advancing the work. On February 23rd, the central government convened a local administrative conference and passed important cases such as strengthening Baojia and increasing production.</p>
<p>Rural Clearing Conference</p>
<p>On February 10th, the National Government convened a rural clearing conference to review past rural clearing work and establish future plans. Many heads of ministries, departments, and commissions from the central government attended. The responsible persons from the rural clearing areas reported on the general situation of past rural clearing work. Various proposals were passed successfully. In early October, Nanjing convened the First National Security Conference to establish local public security as the focus of discussion.</p>
<p>Gao Huaihai Province</p>
<p>In mid-January, the Central Political Conference passed the establishment of Huaihai Province, and it was formally established on February 1st and began operations. The provincial government organization was reorganized from the former Suhuai Special Zone Commissioner's Office, divided into four departments: political affairs, finance, education, and construction, four offices: police affairs, security, propaganda, and health, and four bureaus: economy, social welfare, and opium suppression. Several councilors were also appointed.</p>
<p>Strict Opium Suppression</p>
<p>In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), when the late Chairman Wang was the head of the Executive Yuan, he rigorously implemented opium suppression. Implementation was suspended after the incident in the 26th year of the Republic (1937), otherwise opium would have been eradicated long ago. On February 15th of this year, the Executive Yuan of the National Government passed a draft outline of opium suppression measures, stipulating that opium should be eradicated within a three-year period starting from February of the 33rd year (1944).</p>
<p>Rectifying Officialdom</p>
<p>The government authorities have repeatedly planned to innovate the political institutions in order to adapt to the wartime system. The appointment of Zhang Boli as the Minister of Judicial Administration this year is indeed an expression of sincerely inviting talents from the private sector. In the past, the use of officials was not perfect, resulting in the suffering of unsound officialdom. After the Hu case and the food department's malfeasance occurred, the authorities made a painful decision and organized a special court of the National Government. The National Government promulgated the provisional regulations of the court and appointed Chen Enpu as the president of the special court. The case of Hou Dachun, director of the Jiangsu Food Bureau, and Hu Zheng, director of the Aquatic Products Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Food, who had major malfeasance in purchasing military food during the war, was handed over to the special court for strict trial. After the trial, Hou and Hu were sentenced to death and executed by shooting in Nanjing on March 15th. The people were very happy. The next major events of the year were the handling of the Shanghai special tax fraud case and the dereliction of duty of the personnel of the Rice Control Association.</p>
<p>Rectifying Local Politics</p>
<p>The policy that has always occupied an important position in domestic politics this year is the central government's efforts in local politics. In mid-April, the central government decided to abolish the Wuhan Headquarters of the Military Commission and establish a pacification commissioner's office. After inspecting Jiangsu Province, Interior Minister Mei Siping explained the significance of the reform of provincial administration: (1) enhancing administrative powers; (2) abolishing the three departments and two bureaus; (3) defining the relationship between the central government and the provinces; (4) establishing administrative inspector commissioner's offices. At the same time, the authorities further engaged in the reform of county administration, focusing on: (1) raising the status of county magistrates; (2) enriching county finances; (3) guaranteeing the status of county government assistant personnel; (4) re-editing the Baojia organization law; (5) promoting county local autonomy. In mid-June, the Executive Yuan approved the abolition of the special district commissioner's offices such as Nanhui, which belonged to the Shanghai Special Municipality, restoring the governance of each county and establishing administrative inspector commissioners to administer them separately.</p>
<p>Conserving Combat Strength</p>
<p>At a time when the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly fierce, the government authorities have been strengthening production on the one hand, and engaging in conservation movements on the other - encouraging the public to save and save during the war. In order to rectify the general public's extravagant atmosphere, the consumption special tax rate was adjusted in mid-July; the tax rate on luxury goods was increased, and the tax rate on hotel banquet special tax was changed to a progressive system.</p>
<p>Receiving Italian Concession</p>
<p>In recent years, based on the intention of respecting Chinese sovereignty in the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration between China and Japan, the Japanese concessions in various places have been returned first, and Japan's extraterritorial rights in China have also been abolished. On July 14th of this year, the National Government implemented the reception of the Italian Concession in Tianjin. The signing ceremony of the agreement was signed in Nanjing by our Foreign Minister Chu and Italian Chargé d'Affaires Spinelli on behalf of the two governments.</p>
<p>Communicating Public Opinion</p>
<p>In the process of war participation, due to objective needs, it is necessary for the government and the people to establish public opinion organs in order to communicate up and down and become one. Shanghai is the center of national politics, economy, culture, and education. The gains and losses in its institutional aspects have the greatest impact on various places, and the complexity of various situations is also the crown of various cities. After continuous calls from the press, under the assistance of the municipal authorities and various social parties in this city, the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Advisory Committee was established on May 1st of this year. The consultants hired are all well-known figures in this city, such as Yan Huiqing, Li Sihao, Wen Lanting, and Chen Binyu. All suggestions can be adapted to the times and launched when the opportunity arises. The committee has become the only public opinion organ to serve the people and relieve their suffering. However, some of the committee's suggestions on food, fuel, prices, daily necessities, etc. have been considered by the authorities for various reasons.</p>
<p>Marching Bravely Forward</p>
<p>The late Chairman Wang passed away unfortunately on November 10th while receiving treatment in Japan. When the bad news came, the whole country was saddened. It was truly an irreparable loss to the country. The allied statesman, Duke Konoe, also said, "The late Chairman Wang's death is like the National Government losing its pillar." The new leader, Acting Chairman Chen, announced the policy on November 20th: "All policies decided by the late Chairman Wang will be the policies implemented by Gongbo; all facilities established by Mr. Wang during his lifetime will be the facilities implemented by Gongbo today." "The first is to cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, the second is to promote unification and peace, the third is to purify officialdom, the fourth is to continue production, and the fifth is to establish public security."</p>
<p>Military and Political Conference</p>
<p>In order to review the past, improve the future, and make the government and the people one, the National Military and Political Conference was held in Nanjing on November 20th. According to the Central News Agency, the conference was convened on the day of the burial of the late Chairman Wang, so the atmosphere was extremely tense and solemn. Local officials must be able to respect the posthumous teachings, abide by the resolutions, overcome all difficulties, strengthen the centralized system of military and political integration between the central government and local areas, and move forward bravely.</p>
<p>Sixth Plenary Session</p>
<p>On November 25th, the Chinese Kuomintang held an extraordinary plenary session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee at the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, resolving to issue a declaration. At 10:00 PM, the conference ended successfully, and the members returned to various places overnight to intensify their work.</p>
<p>The main points of the declaration of the conference were: to express the Kuomintang's determination to follow the past revolutionary spirit, and to continue to struggle for the national policy outlined by the Founding Father and the late Chairman Wang, in order to achieve the complete realization of the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Provincial Inspection Conference</p>
<p>On December 5th, the Ministry of Interior convened the first conference of provincial and municipal inspectors. The main task of the conference was to seek the smooth implementation of the inspector system, and to seek a seamless fit between local public security, civil administration, and reform matters with public sentiment.</p>
<h3>Economic Developments in Our Nation During Two Years of War Participation</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>Reorganization of National Economic Committee</p>
<p>On January 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), after the National Government participated in the war, the National Economic Committee was reorganized and placed under the direct jurisdiction of the National Government after being approved by the First Supreme National Defense Conference. The institution was expanded, and the chief of the North China Political Affairs Committee and celebrities in the private sector were invited to participate. The first plenary committee meeting was held on February 12th, and it was resolved to abolish regional economy, implement material control, the outline of wartime economic policy, and to emphasize agriculture. The wartime economic policy outline items include: increasing production, regulating prices, saving consumption, stabilizing the monetary system, regulating finance, and reforming economic institutions.</p>
<p>On June 25th, the National Economic Committee held its second general meeting and passed: (1) increasing agricultural and industrial production; (2) implementing price controls and strengthening transportation; (3) strengthening national savings; (4) establishing a national economic research institute.</p>
<p>Establishment of Control Organizations</p>
<p>In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), all material control organizations tended to be complete: the National Commercial Control Association was established in Shanghai. This is the highest material control organization of commercial autonomy. The scope of work includes the purchase and distribution of materials in the Central China region, the banning and approval of material movement, the management of barter trade between Central China and North China, the organization of industrial and commercial groups, the procurement of military supplies, and the evaluation of the prices of various materials.</p>
<p>The important tasks handled by the Commercial Control Association up to the 32nd year of its establishment are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Visa for material movement.</p>
<p>(2) Registration and purchase of materials - 1. Purchase of wheat; 2. Registration and purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth; 3. Purchase of oil and grain; 4. Unified allocation of flour; 5. Unified allocation of eggs.</p>
<p>(Work of the Grain Control Association) The Rice and Grain Control Committee was established in October of the 32nd year (1943) as an external organization of the Commercial Control Association. It manages the purchase, transportation, storage, allocation, and pricing of rice and grain. An overview of the work carried out by the association after its establishment: 1. Purchase of rice and grain; 2. Allocation of rice and grain in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Work of the Cotton Control Association) The Cotton Control Committee is also an external organization of the Commercial Control Association. Its duties are: the purchase and allocation of cotton in the three provinces and two cities; the supply of cotton for Sino-Japanese military needs and export, the allocation of cotton for general consumption, and the determination of cotton prices, the plan for purchasing funds and material exchange, and the review and issuance of cotton registration and transportation certificates.</p>
<p>Government Control Organizations</p>
<p>The government organizations include: the National Economic Committee - deciding on the overall economic policy, etc.; the Central Price Countermeasures Committee and local economic bureaus - deciding on prices, registering materials, etc. The adjustment of the aforementioned three control committee organizations and the implementation of the control business were decided by the Material Control Deliberation Committee.</p>
<p>North China Materials Committee</p>
<p>The North China Materials and Price Handling Committee is the controlled economic institution in North China, directly under the North China Political Affairs Committee. Its tasks are: (1) supplementing and adjusting important materials; (2) stabilizing prices of important materials and using balancing funds, (3) managing the import and export of important materials, (4) managing matters related to the purchase, storage, movement, exchange, and allocation of important materials.</p>
<p>Government Price Countermeasures</p>
<p>The price problem affects the production and distribution of materials, and is also related to the level of currency value. It is indeed the most important and most difficult problem to solve. The National Government is trying to take effective measures to deal with the soaring prices: (1) encouraging savings; (2) establishing price countermeasures agencies; (3) implementing commodity price limits; (4) expanding the scope of allocated goods; (5) cracking down on hoarding of goods; (6) purchasing materials for deferred payment.</p>
<p>Currency and Financial Countermeasures</p>
<p>The countermeasures adopted by the National Government for currency and finance are summarized as follows: (1) expanding the exchange of old and new currencies; (2) stopping the new issuance of military tickets; (3) changing the exchange rate between savings bonds and the Joint Reserve Bank; (4) expanding the scope of use of savings bonds; (5) cracking down on enemy currency; (6) borrowing from Japan; (7) rectifying the silver and money industry. The sudden increase in the number of newly established financial institutions in the 32nd year (1943) is actually a phenomenon of abnormal financial development, and the crisis of its speculative activities cannot be ignored. The objects of the authorities in this regard are: (1) restricting loans; (2) ordering increased investment; (3) cracking down on promissory notes; (4) cracking down on financial institutions.</p>
<p>(Resumption of Securities Exchange) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Chinese stock trading has become the darling of the times, with a huge impact on prices and people's livelihood. The Shanghai authorities checked the Chinese-owned stock companies in February and March of the 32nd year (1943) and ordered them to reorganize before allowing them to resume operations; stock operations were uniformly limited to spot trading. In July, the Chinese Securities Exchange officially resumed operations with the assistance of the National Government.</p>
<p>(Issuing Grain Treasury Bonds) Due to the importance of the grain problem and the need to raise funds for rice and grain trading, the National Government implemented 500 million yuan of grain treasury bonds.</p>
<p>Production Increase Movement</p>
<p>Under this national goal of increasing production, the National Economic Committee convened its third meeting in mid-January and passed various production increase proposals. Furthermore, the National Agricultural Production Increase Conference, chaired by the three ministers of industry, food, and construction of the National Government, was inaugurated in Nanjing on February 9th. All the proposals of the conference were important issues for promoting the production increase work, including: (1) agricultural administration, (2) rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, (3) mulberry, hemp, and silk, (4) water conservancy, forestry, and reclamation, (5) fishery and animal husbandry, (6) tea industry economy and agricultural technology. At the conference, the departments of industry, food, and construction all made important reports. (6) The Executive Yuan established the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, which actively formulated regulations on the promotion strategy of the production increase work. The committee formulated the "Production Increase Promotion Outline" in mid-February as a guideline for promoting the work.</p>
<p>At the end of March, the China Industrial Association was established in Shanghai as a bridge between the government and the people in the production increase movement.</p>
<p>In mid-April, the Ministry of Industry, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government, organized the Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Investigation Committee, whose purpose was to investigate the actual situation of various industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai in order to seek sound organization and increase production.</p>
<p>In late April, Chinese and Japanese groups organized the Cotton Production Increase Agreement General Association, whose purpose was to mutually connect cotton production increase agencies, in order to have effective policies for the emergency increase of cotton, and to promote implementation.</p>
<p>The National Government has since stated that all policies are aimed at stabilizing people's livelihood and enhancing combat power, and that it is necessary to resolutely implement a controlled economic policy.</p>
<p>Strengthening Finance</p>
<p>The National Government believes that the improper speculation of the financial community has a non-shallow impact on currency circulation. In order to promote the overall material and capital exchange and development, from March 27th, it prohibited the operation of unreasonable remittance exchanges and designated eleven banks to handle remittances in North China. On the one hand, it expanded the area of use of savings bonds and decided to unify the currency system of Huaihai Province. In addition, it obtained the understanding of the Allies, and the Japanese government insisted on the current exchange rate between Chinese currency and Japanese yen. From May 1st, the National Government further implemented its established policy in order to promote the smooth development of finance. It completely eliminated the restrictions on remittances between the North and the South, realizing the free exchange of funds in various regions, and the material exchange can obtain a leap in development from this. Soon, the Shanghai North China Trade Committee was also announced under the new system. (Loan for Central Reserve Credit) In order to strengthen the soundness of the currency system, the Central Reserve Bank signed a credit loan of 400 million Japanese yen with the Bank of Japan on August 25th of the 33rd year (1944), which will be repaid within five years. (The credit loan for North China was 200 million yuan.) The financial community was quite excited to hear the news.</p>
<p>Rice Price Soaring</p>
<p>At the end of May of this year, the government authorities announced the "Outline of Temporary Measures for People's Food in Beijing and Shanghai" in order to enrich people's food. The Japanese side also adopted the same policy in order to balance supply and demand and stabilize prices. After that, government orders have been revised repeatedly for regulating people's food. Indeed, in the past six months, the rising trend of daily necessities has been rapid, entering a state of madness, and the threat to people's lives has reached the point of being fatal. Especially rice and fuel, which cannot be missed for a day, and the high rise has actually been the leader of various living goods. This kind of periodic rise has been commonplace in the past and is not surprising, but the price rise in Central China this time is not a parabolic rise, but a straight-up trend of anti-aircraft guns. As prices rise so high, the people are becoming increasingly impoverished. Although the sharp rise in rice prices in mid-December was due to the fact that production was not ideal, coupled with various wartime relationships, public security and transportation were not perfect, the biggest conclusion was caused by the shortcomings in the personnel mechanism and the arson of profiteers. Especially the latter, the planned manipulation of profiteers is a direct cause of the recent surge in rice prices. As a result, prices of general commodities have doubled, and finance has become more turbulent; tens of thousands of yuan were added to the price in mid-December, and Chinese stocks are firm without rising - this is the trick of profiteers echoing each other. It is heard that the relevant authorities in Shanghai and the control groups of various industries are urgently discussing and dealing with the issues of rice and grain regulation, supply and demand, and suppression of selling prices, and are trying to re-issue household rice.</p>
<p>Industry Gloomy</p>
<p>The industries in the city are in a gloomy state of declining production and suspension of work due to the reduction of coal, electricity, and raw materials. Although the Allies have successively transferred a large number of factories to assist us, except for the production of military supplies and a very small number of companies, they are all sitting idly by, gradually arousing a wave of layoffs. If we do not rise up and seek remedies urgently, this kind of crisis will inevitably be more profound.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Relations During Two Years of War</h3>
<p>— Nomori</p>
<p>On December 8, 1944, with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the late Chairman Wang of our National Government immediately issued a statement, expressing his determination to share weal and woe with Japan to overcome the crisis. The following year, on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th, the late Chairman Wang again encouraged the people with the phrase "shared existence and death." On December 19th of the same month, he further traveled to Japan to achieve further Sino-Japanese cooperation. On January 9, 1943, the National Government, led by the late Chairman Wang, issued a declaration of war against Britain and the United States. Both Chinese and Japanese authorities declared their unwavering belief in complete cooperation to achieve a joint war against Britain and the United States. On the same day, at 11:00 AM, they signed the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration. On the same day, based on the spirit of the Joint Declaration and respecting Chinese sovereignty, the National Government's Premier Wang and Japan's Special Envoy Plenipotentiary, Mamoru Shigemitsu, signed an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. It stipulated that Japan should return the administrative rights of the Japanese-administered concessions in China to the Chinese government as soon as possible and promptly abolish all extraterritorial rights in China.</p>
<p>Recovering Concessions Across Various Regions</p>
<p>Consequently, China established a Concession Reception Committee, while Japan established a Concession Return Committee. On March 30th, Japanese concessions in Hangzhou, Hankou, Suzhou, Shashi, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places were completely returned and received by China. At the end of March, the National Government also received the Beijing Legation Quarter; on June 5th, France also returned the French concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou to China. By July 30th, the Shanghai French Concession was officially handed over to the Chinese government. Because the International Settlement did not belong to a single country, the negotiations for its recovery were slower. The Xiamen Gulangyu International Settlement was officially completely received by China on May 28th. The Shanghai International Settlement was officially recovered by the Chinese government on August 1st.</p>
<p>Abolishing Extraterritorial Rights</p>
<p>Japan announced its abandonment of extraterritorial rights in China on the day the National Government entered the war. Italy, France, Denmark, and Spain also subsequently announced their abandonment. The Japanese government decided to first abolish taxation rights and signed the Treaty on Taxation of Japanese Nationals in China on July 31st. On September 10th, the National Government first notified Ambassador Tani of the scope within which Japanese nationals should obey Chinese laws and pay taxes.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Visits</p>
<p>(1) Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo visited China on March 13, 1943, to thank the late Chairman Wang for his visit to Japan in December 1942 and to express respect for China's participation in the war. He held earnest talks with National Government leaders on cooperating to complete the war. (2) Special Envoy Chen Gongbo Visited Japan - The central government, in recognition of Japan's early return of concessions and the abolition of restrictions on the movement of goods, specially appointed Legislative Yuan President Chen as a special envoy to Japan on April 1st. (3) Minister Aoki Visited China - Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia Affairs visited China on August 19th to examine the situation in China after the implementation of the new policy towards China. (4) The late Chairman Wang and Chen Gongbo Visited Japan Again - To promote closer cooperation and ties between China and Japan, Chairman Wang, accompanied by Legislative Yuan President Chen Gongbo, visited Japan on September 21st. (5) Acting Premier Zhou Fohai Visited Japan. (6) General Yui Mitsuru visited China at the end of September 1944 to investigate the conditions of the people. (7) Advisor Yuuki visited China in mid-October to investigate the economy. (8) Vice-Minister Takeuchi visited China for sightseeing. (9) Premier Chen visited Japan to thank the Japanese government and people for their condolences on the death of Chairman Wang.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Alliance</p>
<p>In order to complete the war and build Greater East Asia, on October 30, 1943, the "Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty" was signed in Nanjing by National Government Premier Wang and Japanese Ambassador Tani Masayuki. The Basic Relations Treaty signed between China and Japan on November 30, 1940, was immediately invalidated, and Sino-Japanese relations were fully based on equal and friendly cooperation.</p>
<p>Greater East Asia Conference</p>
<p>In order to achieve close cooperation among the countries of Greater East Asia and to openly discuss the direction of Greater East Asia's construction, Japan convened the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo on November 5, 1943. The National Government was represented by the late Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan. Vice Premier Zhou Fohai, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Military Affairs Commission Chen Changzu, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Zhou Longxiang, and Deputy Secretary-General Xue Fengyuan attended. Other participants included the leaders of Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and India. The conference unanimously passed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, including five points: co-existence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and contribution to the world. It successfully concluded on the 6th.</p>
<p>Promoting National Diplomacy</p>
<p>Leading figures in Shanghai, such as Wen Lanteng, aimed to enhance friendship with friendly nations, elevate China's international standing, and cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. To this end, in January 1943, they organized the National Diplomacy Promotion Association to assist the government in determining foreign policy. The association repeatedly received support from the government and from Ambassador Shigemitsu of the friendly nation. The association's goals were: autonomous renewal, promoting peace, eliminating the evil forces of Britain and the United States, implementing the teachings of the Founding Father, and protecting overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Cultural Exchange</p>
<p>(1) Sino-Japanese Cultural Association - Established in July 1940, this association was a practical organ for Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. In April 1943, the association held a national congress in Hankou, passing resolutions to exchange Chinese and Japanese professors and students, promote the East Asian Renaissance, and restore universities and libraries in the peace zones.</p>
<p>(2) Greater East Asia Literary Conference - The Second Greater East Asia Literary Conference opened in Tokyo on August 25th. The National Government specially sent Zhou Yueran, Tao Kangde, and 14 others to participate. On November 12, 1944, the Third Greater East Asia Literary Conference opened in Nanjing, China, and Qian Daosun was elected as chairman.</p>
<p>(3) Greater East Asia Press Conference - In order to complete the Greater East Asia War and launch an ideological war, the Japan Newspaper Association specially invited press representatives from various countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere to Tokyo in mid-November to hold the Third Greater East Asia Press Conference. China's representatives included Xu Liqiu and Chen Binhe, among 14 others.</p>
<p>(4) Shanghai Tongwen College University, in order to assist China in promoting wartime culture, donated 3 million Japanese yen to various cultural institutions in China. China's cultural circles expressed great excitement about this.</p>
<p>Transfer of Enemy Property</p>
<p>After the National Government returned to its capital, Japan gradually returned former enemy property to the National Government for management. After the National Government entered the war, new enemy property from Britain and the United States was also transferred to the Chinese side in batches. All state-owned companies were also actively adjusted. In addition, all ownerless property was transferred in early 1944. The Japanese side stated: "It is hoped that after China receives this transferred property, it will be properly handled to stabilize the people's livelihood and complete the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>Transfer of Guangzhouwan</p>
<p>On March 1, 1944, the Japanese military authorities in South China announced the removal of military administration from the Guangzhouwan area, incorporating it under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and formally designating it as a peace zone. The Governor of Guangdong Province and the Japanese military commander jointly signed an agreement to transfer it to the National Government's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>New Policy Implementation</p>
<p>The Japanese government, with the new policy toward China as its core, smoothly resolved special circumstances in various aspects and forged unity with the Chinese government. Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masayuki, with this goal in mind, traveled extensively throughout southern and northern China, engaging in sincere discussions with various parties. It is believed that, through the concerted efforts of both sides, the key points of the new policy will be resolved satisfactorily. The Japanese side also stated that it would spare no support in helping to build a new China, and would not stand idly by in regard to China's commodity price and food policies, agricultural production increase, and light industry revitalization. At the same time, it hoped that the Chongqing side would deeply understand its sincerity. In short, China and Japan should make the greatest efforts to complete the war. After Mr. Ogura took office as the National Government's top economic advisor, he frequently exchanged views with leaders from all walks of life in China, doing his utmost to assist in the development of China's economy and secure resources for the war.</p>
<p>Unwavering to the End</p>
<p>The Japanese Tojo cabinet, in order to address the major war situation and renew morale, resigned en masse on July 18th. The successors were Generals Koiso Kuniaki and Yonai Mitsumasa, who formed a strong cabinet and emerged with a new appearance to adapt to the new situation. The Chinese and Japanese governments jointly declared that they would continue to uphold the spirit of past alliances, concentrate human and material resources, and jointly advance toward defeating Britain and the United States in order to achieve final victory. The late Chairman Wang, on the anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, stated in his address: "Reports are frequently received across the Pacific that the forces of Britain and the United States invading East Asia are weakening day by day... The light of our victory is becoming increasingly evident amidst the liberation of East Asia... Looking back on the past, we are naturally even more excited and confident."</p>
<p>The late Chairman Wang initially went to Japan for medical treatment due to a recurring back ailment. During his convalescence, he received great attention from the Japanese government and people, and was treated by medical authorities who utilized every possible modern medical method. Unfortunately, he did not recover. The Japanese side was shocked to hear the tragic news, with some even shedding tears, believing that the Chairman was not only the head of China but also a pioneer of East Asia, demonstrating the depth of his personal charisma. After the Chairman's death, Chen Gongbo was appointed acting chairman by the central government. The Japanese government expressed its deep expectations. Prime Minister Koiso further stated that upon hearing of Mr. Chen's succession, he rejoiced for the Chinese people and for the future of East Asia as a whole, and that in order to thoroughly defeat the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, protect East Asia, and build a new China, Japan would spare no effort in supporting the Chinese National Government. Acting Chairman Chen also stated that the Chinese National Government would not waver due to the progress of the war. China's participation in the war was not only for its own liberation but also for the liberation of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. For itself, it was a matter of justice and humanity, and for Japan, it was also a matter of justice and friendship.</p>
