<p>社評</p>
<h3>調劑民食與抑平物價</h3>
<p>近來因爲米價的飛漲，一般物價也隨之騰貴。我們現在要限制一般物價的騰貴，必須先從調劑民食，抑平米價入手。</p>
<p>本報日來對於民食問題曾一得論列，然而民食一日未得調劑，米價一日未能回跌，整個物價問題就一日不得解決，甚至日趨嚴重。所以，我們認爲有不壓求詳，繼續申論之必要。</p>
<p>我們曾兩度提出民食救急的對策，綜合要旨：　時至今日，民食問題，已不是單純的米糧的問題，維糧問題也應該同時並論。　民食問題的實任，無論中日當局，與民間領袖，都應該共同担負。</p>
<p>今日我們更大聲疾呼，無論戰局如何嚴重，無論物資如何困乏，對於民食與物價問題是誰也不應該逃避其責任的。可是現在主管當局是否已盡其所能，盟邦駐華當局是否已盡量協助，在民間則領導者是否盡力籌劃，商人否是澈底覺悟自肅。這是程度的問題，我們認爲共同努力的餘地還很充分，旣經着手的也無該再接再厲，繼續努力。</p>
<p>現在我們再提出民食救急對策的二個重大的原則，雖然卑之無高　，然而深信這二原則都是切實不移的。</p>
<p>圓滑運輸　上海民食恐慌如此，而淮海省雜糧堆積過剩，所以無從調劑者、最大原因在於運輸不能圖滑。據聞當局已有打開運輸難關之計畫，希望即日見諸實施，不論鐵道，海運，內柯，凡能遝輸之工具應該盡量利用，救飢如救火，不可一日遲緩。</p>
<p>增加生產　農貸之意義在於增加生產，本報曾一再闡述。現在農貸款項交付期將届，金融界經濟界人士應留意農民需要貸款之季節性，如再行遲延，則無補於農民，就是無從達到增加生產之目的。</p>
<p>在這二原則之下，努力的時機，不可復失。希望官商民及盟邦當局共同注意。不過這是屬於興利方面的，在除弊方面，我們也提出一個切實不移的原則。</p>
<p>所以造成米價的狂漲，所以造成物價的暴騰，我們腮爲這是以往的經濟政策未能無弊的結果。經濟政策必須合理，然後有利，必須適合國悄民情，然後能順利進行·否則「刻舟求劍」的政策，難有效果之可言。同時「削足適履」的辦法，更不足以言成功與失敗。我們今日希望中日雙方都應該大澈大悟，把以往經濟政策不合理之點盡量革除，機構不切實之點盡量改組，最理想的辦法就是由中日雙方當局與民間的領導人士組織一「經濟參謀本部」性質的機構，其任務在消極方面，隨時檢討利弊，研究得失。減少人民不必要之痛苦。在積極方面，針對利弊，體騐得失，適合國情民悄，作成具體改善方案，提供當局執行，並有權監督與糾正執行之進程。如此則一切經濟政策之弊端自可消減，漸進於善。</p>
<p>最後，我們再提出二件事實，爲關心民食者告。　據聞滬市常局與軍部已一再折衝，現已商得借米辦法，軍警與公務人員之重點酊給已無問題。然而一般民食尚望滬市當局及盟邦當局速籌適當辦法。</p>
<p>雜糧商之囤積居奇，提高價格。并非由雜糧缺乏，乃由於米價飛漲而起之一種投機心理。我們希望雜糧商能够不昧良心，趕緊自肅，減低雜糧價格，盡量買出，爲解決民食問題之一助。不然，當局爲統籌調劑計，自當嚴厲處置。</p>
<p>要之，此次米價的飛漲爲一切物價高漲的主要原因，我們旣要興利，又要除弊，雙管齊下，使米價回跌，民食得以調劑，則一切物價自不難同時趨於穩定。誠如大陸新報所論，今日我們不應氣餒，應該振作勇氣，克服困難，旣不可袖手傍觀，更不可徒呼「沒法子」以自嘲，因爲時局嚴重，不能不安定民生，因爲通負膨脹，不能設法緩和，因爲以往經濟政策頗多缺點，不能不力圖整頓，重新出發。我們不能知其可爲而不爲，雖知其不可爲，亦不能不於不可爲中想出可爲的辦法。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>急起解決物價問題</h3>
<p>最近物價非常騰貴，其原因固然並不單純。有人說，戰局的推移與物價的飛漲有關，所以戰局如無有利的大轉機，　價問題的解決即無希望。誠然，戰局的推移對於中國人心理的影響，以及藏慝財產的傾向，是不能否定的。然而，最近的物價飛漲，假如單用這一點來證明，則不僅見解錯誤，抑且可以造成常局者迴避責任的結果。戰局推移直接影嚮於物價者，似遠較普通漢然想像者爲小；此論諒係實情。</p>
<p>近數日來，直接刺　物價上漲者，乃是米價的狂漲，至於冲繩方面的戰局，簡直沒有影　。是以米糧收買工作應如何順利推進，以及解決民食問題的最好辦法何在等問題，都要加以根本檢討，能够實行的對策，迅速果斷的實行，然後米價的飛騰當可相當抑止。當局者當不因事業之如何困難，決以不屈不撓的勇氣者手。軍實上，豈不是因爲各稱困難過分錯綜，而有失却解決它的勇氣，京手專待戰局發生轉　的傾向嗎？</p>
<p>爲安定物價計，通貨方面的對策亦非加以考慮不可。戰時的通貨膨脹，是不可避免的現象，甚至在積極統治嚴密的日本，欲完全阻止通貨膨脹的進行，亦是不可能的；又如重慶治下，在統治力薄弱的地區，通貨的膨脹更以破　性的速度進行。因此使之如何穩定於一定的地步，乃至在可能範圍內使通貨膨脹的速度緩慢下來，實爲通貨政策的主限。儲備銀行的發行金證券等，目的似亦爲此。此種方針必須從各方面合理的徹底施行，固無待言。然而在努力收回通貨的反面，由於物資收買機構的複雜，及其間相互的對立，競爭，或者因為當事者抵顧目的而不擇手段的放任行為，而造成了不必要的放出通貨之結果？如農產物的收買，固須付出適當價格始能恒久施行，然而因實行未必盡善，其反，面由於支付不必要的價格而促使物價騰漲，此種現象亦屬常有。吾人深信這種情形不能不大加檢討。</p>
<p>要之，物價的騰貴原因不止二·三端，同時也是由於所以至於此的經濟情況而發生的。然則，拾探球其原因，不絕努力以求逐步解決外，實無　救之途。若因事態過分深刻困難，且已失之過遲，而不作此種努力，更抱放任態實，則斷乎不可。這是一種氣餒的心理。我們務須振作意氣，克服困難。雖然以經濟原理的平時常職以規眼前的經濟狀態，是不合時宜的，沖繩戰局的推移，意義之深刻，當遠勝以往戰爭之觀念。華中之經濟政策，在廣義下，亦爲戰爭一部份，而與沖繩相比，不免缺乏熱情過分低調之　。主持經濟政策之當事者，恐怕非有脫出現在的「沒法子」主義，傍觀主義，而盡其最善，再圖新出發之勇氣不可吧！（六月五日大陸新報討論）</p>
<h3>美總統特使　仍留莫斯科　努力調整三國間關係</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　美總統特魯曼之特使霍浦金，於五月二十五日到達莫斯科後，迭次與史太林議長會見，努力調整英美蘇三國間關係，原定六月一月歸國，至今日已延期四日，但仍有不能出發之勢，特魯曼之派遣霍浦金赴蘇，期對於波蘭紛爭，德佔領問題，及其他對蘇聯政府之自主外交等商討解決對策，惟英美兩國間懷疑與不安日益加甚</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　據舊金山訊：特魯曼總統，邱吉爾省相，或有可能將聯名致函史太林，討論關于「安全大會」中之否決權一項問題，各界深信邱吉爾本人對此「否決權」亦有問題，目前五大國代表團絢注視渠將如何對蘇聯建議置答。</p>

<h3>解決上海糧食恐慌議</h3>
<p>— 頂康原</p>
<p>項康原先生日昨在諮詢會提出「集中　購雜糧急救本市米荒辦法」一案，本報昨特探錄原案發表，當接上海區食用油業同業公會首先來函，表示贊同與響應。茲　項氏復撰一文，更為具體，妥再爲發刊。迄此，讀者羅君投函，貢獻意見，也有喚起社會人士警覺的意義，一併揭載於后。編者附注</p>
<p>最近本市米價瘋狂上漲，使社會到處呈現著恐慌和不安，家無隔宿之糧者，固然難以應付日常的生活，即家中有存米一年或數月者，日日消費，不願以高價補充，不久亦將難以爲繼。且其他日常用品，莫不隨米價之上騰而激漲。故米貴問題，對於社會各階層都有切膚的關係，毋待贅述。</p>
<p>米價這樣高昂，而人人日常又不能不吃米糧，故人人盼望光實來源，壓低市價；但是據調查所得，四鄉存底，枯竭異常，欲求來源充沛，短期內希望很少。不得已，只有以自力更生的精神，消極方面設法減少消費，積極方面提倡改食雜糧，並力謀充裕來源。茲就管見所及，中論如下。</p>
<p>集中購運雜糧來滬　米價高昂，只能減少食米，多食雜糧，以輕負祖。雖然後者的市價，多少亦隨米價而高漲；但其程度，終較米糧爲和緩，且淮海省等處盛產雜糧，果能集中資力，用官廳力量大量採購來滬，照成本平糶，深信對於本市民食問題之解決，定有很多的助力。上海市政府對集中購運工作，責無旁貸，自應以見義勇爲的精神’速組雜糧購配委員會，專司其事。蓋目下採地和運職途中，阻礙重重，如用官廳力量，較之商人易於奏效。同時責成市商會動員各業公會機構，分別估計會員職工人數，各定一認購雜糧額，先照市府公佈的雜糧種類及約價，付淸貨款，由市商會限期　交委員會，集中購運。如繳款需時較久者，可先商請儲備銀行墊借，俟公會款項付情，即以之償還中儲。俟貨到後，按當初認購額由各公會提貨五成，充配給予各該會員職工之需。其餘五成，由委員會照本徵　，公開平糶，將售價償還各認購公會。其他未入公會之商家社團及住戶欲委托代購，委員會也可接受，惟規定侮一單位至少若千數量，付款及徵購辦法，依公會待遇。但採聯及運輸的先後，公會認購額應有優先權。</p>
<p>鼓勵雜糧生產　　開墾荒地，上海四郊，如徐家匯，龍華，浦東，江灣，吳淞等處，儘多荒地，野草　生，廢棄不墾，很是可惜。市政府應即設法調查淸楚，與各該地主立約，限其依規定辦法墾殖。如業主無意，則市府有權向之租賃，招人承懇，種植雜糧，所有作物售價，統歸承墾人享受，以資獎勵。但土地所有權，仍歸原業主所有。　利用市內空地，南市閘北，經戰火的洗禮後，有很多被燬房屋僅餘瓦礫一堆，有的連瓦礫也被人搬移完了，有一部份維民，搭屋其旁，從事小規模的種植菜麥豆類，雖然零星微少，收獲無多，但這種工作，如用市政府的力量予以有組織的推動耕作，則積少成多，收量也很可觀。吾們主張市府應即責成有關各局，向各該空地的業主租賃，將堆置着的瓦礫泥土垃圾淸除，招人承種雜糧，待遇與上述　項相同。　作物長大後，不特民食賴以充裕，且可澄清市內的空氣。此外，住宅的花園庭院，應仿照第一次歐戰德國糧食增產辦法，由市府分別調查勸諭，一律改種維糧如馬鈴薯等，務使地無曠土，人有餘糧。</p>
<p>消極辦法</p>
<p>解決上海糧食問題，增產以外，減少消費也很重要。吾國人在糧食消費方面較任何國人爲多，其程度約在一比一，五至一比三之間。其實，最適宜的食量，成人每天爲五合至五合半，婦孺每天四合至四合半，工人每天六合半至七合。現在往往每天須吃七八合。甚至一升二三合。細加考察，員是駭人之事。但若有人歸倡限制吃飯，即將認爲不合情理，此係傳統習慣所養成，在平時爲患尚少，可是在這糧食恐慌極端嚴重之時，爲害就很大了。以目前滬市人口四百萬來推算，侮人每日平均食米八合（從低估計），則每日總額需三萬餘石。以後如能把食量減少二成，則每日可省米六千石，一月就可省下十八萬石，足供全市七八日之需。換言之：照原來食量，可維特一月的米，經節減二成後，則可支持三十七八日了，也不無小補。</p>
<p>減食在健康方面講，只有利益，毫無流弊。減食最簡便的辦法，莫加吃粥，尤其是晚餐吃粥，使晚上睡眠時胃腸工作較輕，更爲有益。吾有幾位友人，原先中晚兩膳都是食飯的，後來晚餐改食米粥，經媧數月，體重大增。又某工廠職工的飯量，經廠方加以相當限制，行之數年，各人健康，亦都良好。所以吾國人對減食一事·雖然因目前迫於米貴，方始倡行，即使將來承平以後，爲民族健康着想，仍希望國民都能糾正以前食飯太多的舊習，節制逾量的浪費，以輕個人及國家的負擔。</p>
<p>尾語</p>
<p>上文及獎勵種植雜糧，其中馬鈴薯（俗稱洋山芋或洋芋艿）一項爲最易種植且最易蕃殖，一年之中，可得三四熟，故利益最溥。至其性格及科學栽培法，吾們已請聖約翰大學農學院撰其祥細說明書，公開發表，以供市民參照採用，不久當可見諸報端。</p>
<p>上海的食糧問題，小之關係市民各人的經濟負擔，大之爲社會安危所繫，故朝野人士都應視爲切膚之痛，羣第羣力，各抒所見，共謀解決。如自恃家有存米，而抱隔岸觀火之態度者，或認爲病入膏肓無法可施放槳職責者，均足自誤誤人。所以賢明的政治當局，應速妥籌對策，立付實施；否則如遲遲不行，則縱或西江水到，而涸鮒已作枯魚，尚有何用呢？</p>
<h3>不可忽視的救對策</h3>
<p>— 羅漢</p>
<p>眼前食糧問題的嚴重！已瀕　中游魚！火迫燃眉的危急之秋了！升斗小民，固有朝不保　之慮！而大商·當翁·雖倉　豐厚，但能不能於一旦臨到　民荒亂騷動的暴風雨前，獲得安坐而食的保障？現在窮人和富人，眞已臨到了「同生共死」之時！貧富相差得愈遠，而內在潛伏的危機愈深！黎元洪曾有「有飯大家吃」的口號，必定從潛伏的危機中爆發出來！以致於一發不可收拾！到了那時，享受魚·肉·珍肴和白米飯的大商·富翁，豈能倖存？這不是筆者危言聳聽，而事實上，有其必然性的，寫到這裹，我眞覺得毛骨悚然！不寒而慄！俗語說：「救飢如救火！」戰前侮石米漲到二十元時，已惶惶不可終日！地方長官和地方士紳們，已急議　辦平糶了，而今白米黑價，瘋狂到四十大關，而各方有力者，竟束手無策？其將同歸於盡的趨勢！眞是嚴重到萬萬分！爲今之計，與其一家笑，一路哭！不如共同　請當局和諮詢委員會諸公速疹念民　，立施緊急救　對策，以救民困，以遇亂萌！其法應勸令富戶貸欽，或繳納家藏（國儲）囤米十成之四，（我想有許多富翁們家存白米，近少有六個月至一年之量吧？）集中指定倉庫，憑保甲戶口調查貧民，半價施辦平　！其他如急向內地及　海省等採辦雜糧，趕速運滬救急！並限令各麵粉廠（最好派員前往監視）製粉集中某倉庫，備辦平糶，不得私自出售與黑市，遠則嚴罰捐輸振款，果能出切快刀戰亂麻之手段，我想糧食問題的嚴重性，必能逐漸消減！</p>

<h3>三區模範自警團　昨舉行成立禮　羅兼保甲委員長等親臨主持</h3>
<p>本市泰山　家灣當熟三區自警團模範大隊，自遵奉團本部命，即從事積極編組就緒，於昨（五）日上午十時，假東華球塲聯合舉行成立典禮，市區保甲委員會羅　委員長，團本部　兼秘書長，均親臨主特。並到市警察局副局長第二處長保甲處副處畏，各區辦事處副主任，各股正副主任，各區主任委員，總聯委員，以及保甲工作人員三千餘人。準時開始檢閱，由顧兼秘書長陪同羅兼委員畏，滿副局長等主檢，先舉行分列式，次由三區校範團員表演國術，警據操及防空演習，對於警報傳遠通訊，待避消防救護各項動作，至爲敏捷。旋舉行成立儀式，由主席團林康侯致詞報告三區組訓經過　即舉行宣誓、由主席團張仁忠領導宣讀，顧兼秘書長監警，宣誓畢，　　委員長，滿副局長，顧兼秘書長先後訓話，最後由模範大隊代表張仁忠致謝詞。</p>
<p>羅兼委長詞</p>
<p>羅兼委員長訓詞：「最近本市各區都有自警團模範隊的組織，本人覺得是一個很好的現象，因爲這是表明我們保甲自警團在不斷的進步和强健起來，同時亦可以證明保甲工作人員們努力的收獲。媧去，本市自警團是沒有組織沒有訓練的，當然也是沒有力量的，但是在保甲處　同志以下各位的努力，逐漸訓練了無數有力的模範隊幹部，由道些有力的份子，再產生了各區的模範隊，使散漫的變成有組織的，貧弱的變成有力量的，這一點本人很表示感激。今天是盧家灣，泰山，常熱三區模範大隊聯合成立，今後這三區的自警力量一定會更充實起來，成績可以期待，將來到全市各區模範大隊都宣告成立的時候，我們自警自衛的力量將更發揚光大，前途是有無限的希望。</p>
<p>諸位都已編成了模範隊員，今後將做一般自警團員的表率，平時要指導他們，訓練他們，但是各位的責任當然是要加重了，同時自己亦務須以身作則，自肅自愛，先要使自已成爲一個眞正良好的自警團員，然後去做別人的模範，才可以完成光榮的使命。在決戰的現階段，諸位協力治安，協力防空的工作一天緊張一天，尤其防空方面更屬刻不容緩，大家要戮力同心，作未雨綢繆，一旦有事便可從容應付，不致慌亂，所以希望各位都要克苦耐勞，多多訓練。古人說：「衆志成城」，便是有了團結才有力量的意思，所以由由各區的保甲自警團精誠繼結，那末我相信我們的力量，是不難柯夫任何環境的困難，最後希望各位努力。」</p>
<p>滿副局長詞</p>
<p>滿副局長訓詞略謂；「頃見各同志演习，動作整齊，精神飽滿，頗爲欽成防空任務，至關重要。諸位在上海地區所負使命，實爲國防戰鬥員之預備員。當前之戰爭，乃爲總力之戰，綜合人力物力，尤以人力最爲重要，不但需要大衆力量，且必需要有組織，有訓練，廣集優國防戰鬥員之信條。在組訓方面，重質而不重量，因此深望諸位充分瞭解所負使命之重要，如緊訓練。同時願望諸君之訓練，遍及全國。此外，在訓練階段中，尤須養成軍人化之行動，要確具軍人之姿態動作及軍人服從之精神，刻苦耐勞，犧牲奮鬥。吾人須瞭解如何養成國防總動員之戰鬥者，例如盟邦日本特別注重之國民訓練，可作借鏡，養成良民模範基礎，以造成最理想最優秀之戰鬥員，不分男女，均能擔負此重大使命。最後希望擴充力量，實踐警保密切聯　，以完成重大任務。」</p>
<p>顧處長詞</p>
<p>顧保甲處長兼秘書長訓詞，略謂：「本人擔任保甲工作，在當初即是有一種理想，但當時一般人對保甲工作，似抱懷疑。時至今日，所見保甲情形，已逐漸增强信念。舉几世界萬百事情，祇要努力，當可收穫成效，今日自警團本部三區保甲自警模範同志，均爲編組完成之有力一員，可見保甲人員之熱忱工作，先後樹立幹部份子，深信今後在各大隊一般訓練上，必有極大效力，將來擔負指導本區之自警國員工作。本人對保甲一如以創辦學校之理想予以辦理，從事組織訓練，大家努力教導。全體保甲人　均爲義務職，以服務社會爲宗旨。本人認爲服務社會最爲偉大。孔聖曾　：以福利賜於人民，不圖利祿，此爲聖人。而各位之爲人民服務，不收酬勞，無異孔聖所言。同時我人之保甲工作，旨在培養正氣，結集良民，竭力排除歹徒，今後願望各位自警同志及保甲同志，在保持正氣下，負起服務社會之使命。本人今以此點貢獻諸君，並以此自勉，共同加緊工作，完成係甲之偉大使命。」</p>

<h3>Enemy Aircraft Formation Fiercely Attacks Enemy Warships: Intense Aerial Battles Unfold; Fierce Battles Underway in Southern Okinawa Region</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - On the night of the 3rd, Japanese Air Force units attacked enemy warships in the sea area near Okinawa, inflicting considerable damage. Japanese fighter squadrons also flew over the skies of Okinawa Island, engaging in fierce aerial battles with enemy fighter groups. Furthermore, a small group of enemy naval vessels, including one large warship, approached the southern region of Okinawa Island on the 4th, bombarding Japanese positions. Japanese defending forces valiantly returned fire.</p>
<p>Certain Air Base, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Since the 28th of last month, Okinawa has been significantly impacted by the activities of the Japanese Special Attack Shinbu Corps. As the weather gradually improves, a large-scale attack was launched on the 3rd against enemy warship formations cruising in that area, carrying out self-destructive attacks to inflict heavy damage. The Wakazakura and Yuishin squadrons, flying aircraft, and with close cooperation from the land and sea air forces, broke through the intense defense network on the morning of the 3rd, reaching enemy airspace and successively diving towards enemy warships. Furthermore, to continue this attack in the afternoon, the Takamo squadron, flying aircraft, also bravely took off, attacking the chaotic enemy ships. Prior to the attack, enemy warships around Okinawa were estimated to include three battleships, three cruisers, fifteen destroyers, and one hundred and thirty transport ships off the coast of Kadena, and one battleship and one cruiser off the coast of Itoman, due to poor weather in that area, a thorough verification has yet to be conducted. At that time, a considerable number of warships were in operation, attempting to cooperate with land forces to decisively determine the outcome of the battle. The activities of the enemy fleet are of great importance, and the rapid change in the war situation is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Fierce battles continue to unfold in the southern region of Okinawa Island. On both the east and west coasts, the enemy forces have not made significant advances due to Japanese counterattacks. However, the enemy forces in the central area have gradually moved south, crossing the Kokuba River from a point three to four kilometers south of Shuri, advancing towards the Japanese defense lines on the southern coast. Japanese troops bravely engaged, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy to impede their advance. Additionally, Japanese special attack forces continued to attack enemy warship formations around the island from the 1st to the 3rd, expanding their battlefield victories amidst adverse weather conditions.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Hanshin Area; 200 Aircraft Shot Down; Fire in Eastern Kobe Quickly Extinguished</h3>
<p>Osaka, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - The Central Military District Command announced at 3:00 PM on the 5th that approximately 350 B-29 aircraft from southern bases gathered south of the Kii Channel and southeast of Tosa around 6:00 AM on the 5th. Around 7:00 AM, in formations of ten to thirty aircraft, they invaded the Hanshin area, attacking the vicinity of Kibe and Okage-cho Sugaya in Kobe City with incendiary bombs. After approximately one and a half hours, they passed through Osaka and escaped from Kumano. Although fires broke out in eastern Kobe City and Uozaki City, the fires gradually subsided due to the brave efforts of civil defense air raid units. The results achieved by Japanese army and naval air defense units, as ascertained by 2:00 PM, are as follows: fifty-six aircraft shot down, one hundred and forty-four aircraft destroyed. Japanese losses included seven aircraft that failed to return (including those involved in kamikaze attacks).</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Regulating People's Food and Suppressing Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the soaring price of rice, general prices have also risen. Now, to limit the soaring general prices, we must start with regulating people's food and suppressing the price of rice.</p>
<p>This newspaper has discussed the food problem in recent days. However, if the food problem is not solved and the price of rice does not fall, the entire price problem will not be solved, and may even worsen. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to continue to elaborate on this issue.</p>
<p>We have twice proposed emergency measures to address the food problem, the main points of which are: Today, the food problem is no longer simply a matter of rice. The problem of maintaining grain supplies should also be discussed at the same time. The responsibility for the food problem should be jointly shouldered by both Chinese and Japanese authorities and civilian leaders.</p>
<p>Today, we urgently call for the responsibility for the food and price problems should not be avoided by anyone, no matter how serious the war situation is or how scarce resources are. However, have the competent authorities done their best, have the Allied authorities in China provided as much assistance as possible, have the leaders in the private sector done their best to plan, and have the merchants thoroughly awakened and exercised self-restraint? This is a question of degree. We believe there is still ample room for joint efforts. Those who have already started should continue to persevere and continue to work hard.</p>
<p>Now we propose two major principles for emergency measures to address the food problem. Although they may seem humble, we firmly believe that both principles are practical and unwavering.</p>
<p>Smooth transportation: Shanghai is experiencing a food panic, while miscellaneous grains are overstocked in Jiangsu Province, making it impossible to regulate the situation. The biggest reason for this is the failure to ensure smooth transportation. It is said that the authorities have plans to overcome transportation difficulties. We hope to see them implemented immediately. All available transportation tools, including railways, sea transport, and inland waterways, should be utilized to the fullest extent. Saving the starving is like putting out a fire, and there should be no delay.</p>
<p>Increase production: The significance of agricultural loans lies in increasing production, as this newspaper has repeatedly explained. Now that the loan disbursement period is approaching, people in the financial and economic sectors should pay attention to the seasonal need for loans by farmers. Further delays will not benefit farmers and will not achieve the goal of increasing production.</p>
<p>Under these two principles, the opportunity for effort must not be lost. We hope that officials, merchants, the public, and Allied authorities will pay attention to them together. However, this belongs to the aspect of promoting benefits. In terms of eliminating evils, we also propose a practical and unwavering principle.</p>
<p>The reason for the soaring price of rice and the skyrocketing price of goods is that we believe this is the result of the failure of past economic policies to be free of flaws. Economic policies must be reasonable and then beneficial, and they must suit national conditions and popular sentiment, and then proceed smoothly. Otherwise, a policy of "carving a boat to find a sword" will hardly be effective. At the same time, a method of "cutting one's feet to fit the shoes" is not enough to speak of success or failure. Today, we hope that both China and Japan should come to a full realization and eliminate as much as possible the unreasonable points of past economic policies and reorganize as much as possible the impractical points of institutions. The most ideal way is for the Chinese and Japanese authorities and private sector leaders to organize an institution in the nature of an "Economic Staff Headquarters", whose task is to review the pros and cons at any time, study the gains and losses, and reduce the unnecessary pain of the people on the negative side. On the positive side, based on the pros and cons, experience the gains and losses, suit the national conditions and public sentiment, and create a concrete improvement plan to provide to the authorities for execution, and have the right to supervise and correct the progress of execution. In this way, the shortcomings of all economic policies can be reduced and gradually improved.</p>
<p>Finally, we present two more facts to those who care about people's food. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the military have repeatedly negotiated and have now agreed on a method of borrowing rice, and the focus of food distribution to military police and civil servants is no longer a problem. However, the general public's food situation still requires the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Allied authorities to quickly formulate appropriate measures.</p>
<p>Hoarding and raising prices by grain merchants is not due to a shortage of grain, but to a speculative mentality caused by the soaring price of rice. We hope that grain merchants will be able to act with conscience, quickly exercise self-restraint, reduce grain prices, and buy out as much as possible to help solve the food problem. Otherwise, the authorities will take severe measures for the sake of overall regulation.</p>
<p>In short, the soaring price of rice is the main reason for the rise in all prices. We must both promote benefits and eliminate evils, taking a two-pronged approach to bring down the price of rice and regulate people's food, and then all prices will naturally tend to stabilize at the same time. As the Continental New Daily said, today we should not be discouraged, but should muster courage to overcome difficulties. We cannot stand idly by, nor can we simply cry "no way" to mock ourselves, because the situation is serious, and we cannot destabilize people's livelihood, because inflation is rampant, and we cannot find ways to alleviate it, because past economic policies have many shortcomings, and we must strive to rectify them and start anew. We cannot know that something can be done and not do it, and even if we know that something cannot be done, we cannot but think of ways to make it possible within the impossible.</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>Urgently Solving the Price Problem</h3>
<p>Recently, prices have been very high, and the reasons for this are certainly not simple. Some say that the progress of the war is related to the soaring prices, so unless there is a favorable turning point in the war, there is no hope for solving the price problem. It is true that the progress of the war has an impact on the psychology of the Chinese people and the tendency to hoard property cannot be denied. However, if the recent soaring prices are simply used to prove this point, it will not only be a wrong view, but also may result in the authorities avoiding responsibility. The direct impact of the progress of the war on prices seems to be much smaller than commonly imagined; this argument is likely to be true.</p>
<p>In recent days, the direct cause of rising prices has been the soaring price of rice, and the battle on Okinawa has had virtually no impact. Therefore, how to smoothly promote the rice procurement work and what is the best way to solve the food problem must be fundamentally reviewed. Countermeasures that can be implemented should be implemented quickly and decisively, and then the soaring price of rice can be considerably suppressed. The authorities should not lose the courage to solve the problem because of the difficulties involved, and should resolutely take action with indomitable courage. In fact, isn't it because the various difficulties are too complicated that they have lost the courage to solve them and are simply waiting for a change in the war situation?</p>
<p>For the sake of stabilizing prices, countermeasures in terms of currency must also be considered. Wartime inflation is an unavoidable phenomenon. Even in Japan, where strict control is in place, it is impossible to completely prevent inflation. As in Chongqing, in areas where control is weak, inflation is proceeding at an explosive rate. Therefore, how to stabilize it at a certain level, and even slow down the rate of inflation within a possible range, is the main limitation of currency policy. The issuance of gold-backed securities by reserve banks seems to be for this purpose as well. It goes without saying that this policy must be implemented rationally and thoroughly in all aspects. However, on the reverse side of the effort to recover currency, is it not the result of unnecessary release of currency caused by the complexity of the material procurement institutions and their mutual opposition and competition, or because the parties involved disregard the purpose and allow unrestrained behavior by all means? For example, the procurement of agricultural products must be carried out at a reasonable price in order to be implemented permanently. However, in practice, because the implementation is not necessarily perfect, the reverse side is that the payment of unnecessary prices promotes rising prices, which is also a common phenomenon. We firmly believe that this situation must be greatly reviewed.</p>
<p>In short, there are more than two or three reasons for rising prices, and it is also due to the economic situation that has led to this. Then, there is no way to save the situation other than to explore the reasons and make unremitting efforts to gradually solve them. If, because the situation is too profound and difficult and it is already too late, this effort is not made, and instead a laissez-faire attitude is adopted, it is absolutely impossible. This is a discouraged mentality. We must muster our spirits and overcome difficulties. Although it is not appropriate to regulate the current economic situation with the ordinary duties of peacetime in terms of economic principles, the progress of the Battle of Okinawa is of a deeper significance and surpassing previous concepts of war. Economic policy in Central China is also a part of the war in a broad sense, but compared with Okinawa, it inevitably lacks enthusiasm and is too low-key. Those in charge of economic policy are probably in need of breaking out of the current "no way" doctrine, the bystander's doctrine, and exert their best efforts to find new courage to start afresh!

<h3>US Presidential Envoy Still in Moscow, Efforts to Adjust Relations Among the Three Countries</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Since arriving in Moscow on May 25, US President Truman's envoy, Harry Hopkins, has repeatedly met with Chairman Stalin, striving to adjust relations among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. He was originally scheduled to return home on June 1, but has been postponed for four days to date, but there is still no sign of his departure. Truman sent Hopkins to the Soviet Union to discuss and resolve issues such as the Polish dispute, the German occupation problem, and other independent diplomacy with the Soviet government. However, suspicion and unease between Britain and the United States are increasing.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - According to a report from San Francisco, President Truman and Prime Minister Churchill may jointly send a letter to Stalin to discuss the issue of the veto power in the "Security Conference". It is widely believed that Churchill himself also has questions about this "veto power", and the delegations of the five major powers are paying close attention to how he will respond to the Soviet proposal.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - According to a report from Tehran, the Iranian government led by Ebrahim Hakimi resigned yesterday.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Solving the Shanghai Food Panic</h3>
<p>— By Kangyuan Xiang</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Kangyuan Xiang proposed a "Centralized Purchase of Coarse Grains to Urgently Relieve the City's Rice Shortage" at the Advisory Council. Our newspaper specially recorded and published the original proposal yesterday. Immediately, the Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Association sent a letter expressing its approval and support. Now, Mr. Xiang has written another article with more specific details, which we are publishing again. Furthermore, a reader, Mr. Luo, has submitted a letter with his opinions, which also has the significance of arousing public awareness. We are publishing it below as well. - Editor's Note</p>
<p>Recently, the soaring rice prices in this city have created panic and unease everywhere in society. Those who do not have enough grain for even one night are certainly finding it difficult to cope with daily life. Even those who have rice stored for a year or several months are unwilling to replenish it at high prices as they consume it daily, and will soon find it difficult to sustain themselves. Moreover, other daily necessities are also rising sharply along with rice prices. Therefore, the high rice price is a matter of grave concern to all sectors of society, and there is no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>Rice prices are so high, and everyone must eat rice every day, so everyone hopes for a solid source to lower market prices. However, according to surveys, the reserves in the surrounding countryside are extremely depleted, and there is little hope of finding a sufficient source in the short term. Therefore, we have no choice but to rely on our own efforts, passively seeking to reduce consumption, and actively promoting the consumption of coarse grains, while striving to secure a sufficient supply. I will now present my humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Centralized Purchase and Transportation of Coarse Grains to Shanghai: Rice prices are high, so we can only reduce rice consumption and eat more coarse grains to ease the burden. Although the market prices of the latter have also risen to some extent along with rice prices, the degree is ultimately more moderate than that of rice. Moreover, coarse grains are abundant in provinces like Huaihai. If we can pool resources and use the power of the government to purchase large quantities and transport them to Shanghai for sale at cost price, I firmly believe that it will greatly help solve the city's food problem. The Shanghai Municipal Government has an unshirkable responsibility for the centralized purchase and transportation work, and should promptly establish a Coarse Grains Purchase and Allocation Committee with a spirit of "acting righteously and bravely" to handle the matter. Currently, there are many obstacles in the acquisition and transportation process. Using the power of the government will be more effective than relying on merchants. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should be tasked with mobilizing the organizations of various trade associations to estimate the number of members and employees, and set a quota for the purchase of coarse grains for each, pay the price according to the types and estimated prices of coarse grains announced by the Municipal Government, and submit the payment to the Committee within a deadline for centralized purchase and transportation. If it takes a long time to pay, they can first consult with the Reserve Bank for a loan, and repay the Central Reserve Bank when the trade association's payment is made. After the goods arrive, the trade associations will take 50% of their originally purchased quota to distribute to their members and employees. The remaining 50% will be sold publicly at cost price by the Committee, and the proceeds will be returned to the purchasing trade associations. The Committee can also accept requests from merchants, social groups, and households that are not members of trade associations for commissioned purchases, but stipulate a minimum quantity for each unit, and the payment and purchase methods will be the same as for trade associations. However, the trade associations' purchase quotas should have priority in acquisition and transportation.</p>
<p>Encouraging Coarse Grain Production: Reclaim wasteland. There is a lot of wasteland in the suburbs of Shanghai, such as Xujiahui, Longhua, Pudong, Jiangwan, Wusong, etc., with wild grass growing and abandoned land, which is a great pity. The Municipal Government should immediately investigate the situation clearly, and sign contracts with the landowners to require them to cultivate the land according to the regulations. If the owners are unwilling, the Municipal Government has the right to lease the land and recruit people to cultivate it, planting coarse grains. All the crops sold will be enjoyed by the cultivators as an incentive. However, the land ownership will still belong to the original owners. Utilize open spaces in the city. After the baptism of war, there are many houses destroyed in Nanshi and Zhabei, leaving only piles of rubble. Some have even had the rubble removed. Some residents have built houses next to them and engaged in small-scale planting of vegetables, wheat, and beans. Although scattered and small, and the harvest is not much, if the Municipal Government uses its power to promote cultivation in an organized manner, the accumulation will be significant, and the yield will be considerable. We advocate that the Municipal Government should immediately instruct the relevant bureaus to lease the open spaces from the owners, clear the piles of rubble, mud, and garbage, and recruit people to cultivate coarse grains. The treatment should be the same as mentioned above. After the crops grow, not only will the people's food be enriched, but the air in the city can also be purified. In addition, the gardens and courtyards of residences should follow the German food production increase method during the First World War. The Municipal Government should conduct surveys and persuade them to change to planting staple foods such as potatoes, so that there is no wasted land and people have enough food.</p>
<p>Passive Measures</p>
<p>To solve the food problem in Shanghai, in addition to increasing production, reducing consumption is also very important. Our countrymen consume more food than any other country, with the ratio being about 1:1.5 to 1:3. In fact, the most suitable amount of food is 5 to 5.5 合 (hé, a unit of dry measure, about 0.1 liter) per day for adults, 4 to 4.5 合 per day for women and children, and 6.5 to 7 合 per day for workers. Now, people often eat 7 or 8 合, or even 1.2 to 1.3 升 (shēng, a unit of dry measure, about 1 liter). A closer examination reveals that this is appalling. However, if someone advocates limiting eating, it will be considered unreasonable. This is formed by traditional habits. In normal times, the harm is still small, but in this time of extreme food panic, the harm is very great. Based on the current population of 4 million in Shanghai, if each person eats an average of 8 合 of rice per day (an underestimate), the total daily requirement is more than 30,000 石 (dàn, a unit of dry measure, about 100 liters). If we can reduce the amount of food by 20%, we can save 6,000 石 of rice per day, and 180,000 石 per month, which is enough to meet the needs of the city for 7 or 8 days. In other words, the rice that can be maintained for one month at the original amount of food can support 37 or 38 days after a 20% reduction, which is not a small help.</p>
<p>From a health perspective, reducing food has only benefits and no drawbacks. The simplest way to reduce food is to eat more porridge, especially porridge for dinner, so that the stomach and intestines work lighter during sleep, which is more beneficial. Several of my friends used to eat rice for both lunch and dinner. Later, they changed to eating rice porridge for dinner. After several months, their weight increased significantly. Also, the amount of food for the workers in a factory was properly restricted by the factory. After several years of implementation, everyone's health is good. Therefore, although our countrymen are only advocating reducing food because of the current high rice prices, even if peace comes in the future, for the sake of national health, we still hope that the people can correct the old habit of eating too much rice, control excessive waste, and reduce the burden on individuals and the country.</p>
<p>Concluding Remarks</p>
<p>In the above article and the encouragement to plant coarse grains, the potato (commonly known as "yang shanyu" or "yang yunai") is the easiest to plant and the easiest to propagate. It can be harvested three or four times a year, so the benefits are the greatest. As for its characteristics and scientific cultivation methods, we have asked the Agricultural College of St. John's University to write a detailed explanation for public release, so that citizens can refer to and adopt it. It will soon be seen in the newspapers.</p>
<p>The food problem in Shanghai is related to the economic burden of each citizen, and is also related to social security. Therefore, people in the government and in the private sector should regard it as a matter of grave concern, and work together to find a solution. Those who rely on their own stored rice and adopt an attitude of indifference, or think that the disease is incurable and give up their responsibilities, will only mislead themselves and others. Therefore, wise political authorities should quickly formulate countermeasures and implement them. Otherwise, if they delay, even if the water of the Xijiang River arrives, the dried carp will have become a withered fish. What use is there then?</p>
<h3>Countermeasures that Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>— By Luohan</p>
<p>The severity of the food problem is now on the verge of a crisis, like fish trapped in a drying pond! It is a time of imminent danger, like eyebrows singed by fire! Ordinary people are naturally worried about not having enough to eat in the morning. However, even wealthy merchants and landlords, despite their abundant stores, can they be guaranteed to sit and eat in peace when confronted with the imminent storm of famine and riots? Now, the poor and the rich have truly reached a point of "shared survival"! The wider the gap between the rich and the poor, the deeper the latent crisis! Li Yuanhong once had the slogan "Everyone eats rice together," which will surely erupt from the latent crisis, becoming uncontrollable once it starts! At that time, how can the wealthy merchants and landlords who enjoy fish, meat, delicacies, and white rice survive? I am not trying to scare anyone, but this is inevitable. Writing this, I truly feel a chill down my spine! The proverb says, "Saving from hunger is like fighting a fire!" Before the war, when each 石 (dàn) of rice rose to twenty yuan, people were already in a state of anxiety! Local officials and gentry were already urgently discussing methods for selling rice at a low price. Now, the price of white rice has reached the insane level of forty yuan, yet those in power are helpless? The trend of everyone perishing together is truly serious beyond words! As it is now, instead of one family laughing while the rest cry, it is better to jointly implore the authorities and the members of the Advisory Committee to quickly consider the people's suffering and implement emergency rescue measures to alleviate the people's distress and prevent turmoil! The method should be to persuade the wealthy households to lend grain or hand over forty percent of their stored rice (national reserves). (I believe many wealthy people have white rice stored in their homes, at least six months to a year's worth, right?) Concentrated in designated warehouses, the poor can be investigated and identified through the baojia household registration system, and sold at a reduced price! Other measures such as urgently purchasing coarse grains from the inland and coastal provinces, and transporting them to Shanghai to alleviate the emergency! And limit all flour mills (it is best to send people to supervise) to concentrate the flour in a certain warehouse for selling at a low price, and not to sell it privately on the black market. Those who violate this will be severely punished by donating to relief efforts. If decisive measures are taken quickly, I believe the severity of the food problem can be gradually reduced!</p>

<h3>Model Self-Defense Corps of Three Districts Holds Founding Ceremony Yesterday, Luo, Concurrent Head of Baojia Committee, and Others Attended and Presided Over</h3>
<p>The Model Brigade of the Self-Defense Corps of the Taishan, Lujiawan, and Dangshu Three Districts of this city, since following the order of the Corps Headquarters, has been actively organizing and preparing. Yesterday (5th) morning at 10 o'clock, the joint founding ceremony was held at the Donghua Ball Field. Luo, Concurrent Head of the Municipal District Baojia Committee, and Gu, Concurrent Secretary-General of the Corps Headquarters, both attended and presided over the ceremony. Also present were the Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Second Chief, the Deputy Director of the Baojia Section, the Deputy Directors of the District Offices, the Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of the Sections, the Chairmen of the Districts, the General Liaison Committee members, and more than 3,000 Baojia workers. The inspection began on time, with Gu, Concurrent Secretary-General, accompanying Luo, Concurrent Chairman, Man, Deputy Director, and others. First, a review parade was held. Then, members of the three-district model corps demonstrated martial arts, police exercises, and air defense drills. The actions for alarm transmission, communication, evacuation, fire fighting, and rescue were very agile. Then, the founding ceremony was held. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Presidium, delivered a speech reporting the training progress of the three districts. Then, the oath was taken, led by Zhang Renzhong, Chairman of the Presidium, and supervised by Gu, Concurrent Secretary-General. After the oath, Luo, Concurrent Chairman, Man, Deputy Director, and Gu, Concurrent Secretary-General, gave speeches successively. Finally, Zhang Renzhong, representative of the Model Brigade, delivered a thank-you speech.</p>
<p>Speech by Luo, Concurrent Chairman</p>
<p>Luo, Concurrent Chairman, said in his speech: "Recently, model teams of the Self-Defense Corps have been organized in various districts of this city, which I think is a good phenomenon. This is because it shows that our Baojia Self-Defense Corps is constantly progressing and strengthening, and at the same time it can also prove the harvest of the hard work of the Baojia staff. In the past, the Self-Defense Corps of this city was unorganized and untrained, and of course had no power. However, with the efforts of the comrades of the Baojia Section and below, countless capable model team cadres have been gradually trained, and these capable members have produced the model teams of each district, making the scattered organized and the weak powerful. I am very grateful for this. Today is the joint establishment of the Model Brigade of the Lujiawan, Taishan, and Changshu Three Districts. From now on, the self-defense power of these three districts will definitely be more substantial, and achievements can be expected. When the model brigades of all districts in the city are announced, our self-defense power will be further promoted, and the future is full of unlimited hope.</p>
<p>You have all been formed into model team members, and from now on you will be the role models for general Self-Defense Corps members. You must guide and train them in peacetime, but your responsibilities will naturally be increased. At the same time, you must also set an example, self-discipline, and self-love, and first make yourself a truly good Self-Defense Corps member, and then be a model for others, so that you can complete your glorious mission. At the current stage of the decisive battle, your work of cooperating with public security and cooperating with air defense is becoming more and more tense, especially air defense is even more urgent. Everyone must work together to prepare for a rainy day, so that you can deal with it calmly once something happens, without being flustered. Therefore, I hope that everyone will work hard and train more. The ancients said: 'Unity is strength,' which means that there is strength only when there is unity. Therefore, I believe that our strength will not be difficult to overcome any environmental difficulties if the Baojia Self-Defense Corps of each district are united sincerely. Finally, I hope everyone will work hard."</p>
<p>Speech by Man, Deputy Director</p>
<p>Deputy Director Man said briefly in his speech: "I just saw the comrades practicing, their movements are neat, and their spirit is full, which is quite admirable. Air defense tasks are very important. The mission you bear in the Shanghai area is actually the reserve force of the national defense combatants. The current war is a total war, integrating manpower and material resources, especially manpower is the most important. It not only needs the power of the masses, but also needs to be organized and trained, and widely gather the creed of excellent national defense combatants. In terms of organization and training, focus on quality rather than quantity. Therefore, I deeply hope that you will fully understand the importance of the mission you bear and train closely. At the same time, I hope that your training will spread throughout the country. In addition, during the training phase, it is especially necessary to develop military-like actions, and must have the posture, movements, and spirit of obedience of soldiers, work hard, and strive for sacrifice. We must understand how to cultivate the combatants of the national defense general mobilization. For example, the national training that the Allied nation Japan pays special attention to can be used as a reference to cultivate the foundation of good citizen models to create the most ideal and best combatants, regardless of men or women, can shoulder this important mission. Finally, I hope to expand the strength and practice the close connection between police and security to complete major tasks."</p>
<p>Speech by Director Gu</p>
<p>Director Gu, Head of the Baojia Section and Concurrent Secretary-General, said briefly in his speech: "When I took on the Baojia work, I had an ideal, but at that time, the general public seemed to be skeptical about the Baojia work. Today, the Baojia situation I have seen has gradually strengthened my belief. To do everything in the world, as long as you work hard, you can achieve results. Today, the model comrades of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps of the three districts of the Corps Headquarters are all powerful members who have completed the organization. It can be seen that the Baojia personnel are enthusiastic about their work, and have established cadres one after another. I firmly believe that in the general training of the major teams in the future, there will be great effects, and they will be responsible for guiding the self-defense state members in this district in the future. I will handle the Baojia in the same way as running a school, engaging in organization and training, and everyone will work hard to teach. All Baojia people are volunteers, and their purpose is to serve the society. I think serving the society is the greatest. Confucius once said: 'To bestow blessings on the people without seeking profit is a sage.' And you are serving the people without receiving remuneration, which is no different from what Confucius said. At the same time, our Baojia work aims to cultivate integrity, gather good people, and try our best to eliminate gangsters. In the future, I hope that all self-defense comrades and Baojia comrades will uphold integrity and take on the mission of serving the society. I now offer this point to you, and I also encourage myself with this, to work harder together and complete the great mission of the Baojia."</p>
<h3>Southern District Baojia Re-checks Household Registration</h3>
<p>The household registration of the Yi, Penglai, and Xieqiao three Baojia districts in the southern district was surveyed once in the middle of last June after the establishment of the southern district office of the Baojia Section. However, in recent times, many residents have been evacuated back to their hometowns, and the original household registration statistics are no longer applicable. Therefore, a re-check was carried out from June 1 to ensure accuracy. The household registration survey forms have now been distributed to the Bao offices, ordering them to distribute them to each resident household to fill out in accordance with the format, and set a deadline for completion on June 15.</p>
