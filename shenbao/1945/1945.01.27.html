<p>首都通訊</p>
<h3>陳代主席的治國經綸</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　澹明</p>
<p>汪故主席逝世之後，全國在陳代主席領導之下，配合當前時局的需要，躍入新的階段。亳無疑義，當此世界大戰入於決定的關頭，能够獲得一個新的堅强沉毅的領袖，來繼續實現並進而發揚光大汪故主席的未竟之志，前途的光明，自可預卜。記者奉命進謁陳代主席。蒙代主席於本月二十二日下午四時在北平路官邸接見。</p>
<p>說起來記者還是陳代主席的一個舊部，在印象中始終覺得陳代生席好像史太林一般是「鐵的巨人」，自從他榮任代理國府主席之後，今天還是首次謁見。我想一般人久已知道，陳氏是當今我國最講實踐的一人，他素來不喜歡作什麼空泛不切實際的議論。在他任代理主席之後，新聞記者被接見，我想這還是第一次。當記者請求作二十分鐘的談話時。他很爽快地答應了，那一種明快堅實的風度，恐怕在當今中國是手屈一指的吧！</p>
<p>實現遺志</p>
<p>『在主席領導全國踏入新的決戰時代之後，」記者單刀直入地問：『不知道中日關係將如何演進？」</p>
<p>『正像我在去年十一月二十日就職時所說的，」陳代主席不假思索的回答：『我決然想澈底實現汪故主席的遺志。』</p>
<p>「所謂汪故主席的遣志是什麼呢？第一，就是參戰。老老實實地說，我國的參戰是自發的，亳沒有受任何人的推動。爲什麼呢？一則，我國受英美侵略已久，只有乘這個時機來使我國脫離殖民地化的傾向；二則，我國參戰之後可以使國家地位提高，表示我國對盟邦合作的決意，而由是發掘出新的前途。』</p>
<p>『然而在這時候，」記者說：「民生實在太苦了，不曉得對經濟能有什慶辦法？」</p>
<p>「這就是我要指出的第二點，』陳代主席接下去：」在現時代離開了經濟根本就不能談政治。所以，我堅決要和盟邦協力澈底解決通貨發行數量問題。」</p>
<p>『怎樣解決通貨發行問題呢？』記者問：『目前政府方面不得不增稅，公務員也不得不日求加薪，如果物價繼續上昇，要解決恐怕非常困難。何况政府增稅之後，循環地將刺激物價上昇。』</p>
<p>『這倒不是最重要的，」代主席笑着說：「重要的乃在於如何使通貨發行有調節，換句話說是，使通貨發行到適當的限度，因爲這個問題顯然和生產有密切的關係。我可以負責向你說，我們現在正和盟邦切實研究中，在最短期內必定會把這個問題解決的。』</p>
<p>「最後一點，便是和平統一，這三點汪故主席的遺志，在任何情况之下，我必然要設法使共完全實現，我曾堅決地和盟邦人士說，中國的統一是無論如何必須維護的，我誓不願中國發生任何分裂的現象。所以只要我在任一日，舉凡任何不統一的現象，無論環境如何困難，必得盡力使其完全剷除。』</p>
<p>內政革新</p>
<p>看到陳代主席這樣興奮地談話，記者的精神也爲之一振。雖然外面已另有他客候謁，談話仍舊繼續下去。</p>
<p>「對於內政方面，」談話轉了一個方向：「不知道主席將如何着手整理？』</p>
<p>「這便是我老生常談的廉潔政治，」陳代主席滔滔地說：「此我已決心要在最近澄清吏治了。」</p>
<p>「將如何開始，如何進行呢？」我問：</p>
<p>「當然要顧到實際情形，」他說：「過去我在上海主政數年，結果十二分使我痛心，爲了那裏環境過於複雜，沒有達到我預期的目的。然而這裏首都的情形便不同了，我預備先在這裏痛痛快快地幹一番。我已經召集了陸軍部長，憲兵司令，警察總監和市長討論一過。這裏的軍警聽說很多不能自論的，我已準備自下月起按月以九千萬元作他們的特別津貼，如果下月起還是有舞弊發生，一律槍決，決不寛貸。」</p>
<p>「主席下如是的決心，正是登斯氏於袵席了。」記者挿入一句。</p>
<p>「因爲非如是，不足以造成一種良好的風氣。」</p>
<p>「要造成良好的風氣，」我再問一句：「除了用重刑之外，似乎還要注意到全國的國民道德。不知道主席對於現在所推行的新國民運動有什麽意見？」</p>
<p>「我以爲，」陳氏回答：「新國民遝動最好要做到：目標簡單化，同時由此養成國民的集團行動。我國人民本來很少講團結的，這實在是一種重要的病症。」</p>
<p>講到這裏，記者報告後天奉命要到蘇北各地去考察，或許可以供給他一些改革縣政的資料。</p>
<p>「你一個人去嗎？」陳代主席聽了很興奮：「如果有什麼因難，你可以要求當地軍警的合作，等你回來，倒很願聽聽你的結論。」</p>
<p>至此於是興辭了，在暮色蒼茫中，記者滿懷熱情，走出這座簡樸的官邸。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>重振警察新精神</h3>
<p>周兼警察局長於二十四日，召集警局高級員警訓話時，表示（一）此次出任市長及兼警察局長，對整頓警政，已抱具最大決心，且爲唯一任務。（二）以後警察絕對不得再有向民衆留難索賄情事，否則一經查實，絕不容情，從嚴懲處。（三）自二月一日起，對員警待遇，當予改善，食米之配給，自彼時起免費發配，每人至少可得三斗，薪餉亦將酌量增加。（四）警察消費合作社予以擴充，增加資本一萬萬元，盡量强化採辦配給工作，對各極日用必需品均極力設法配給，以安定警察生活。（五）將來準備對正副處長，正副分局長，正副科長等，發給機密費或遊，公費等，以資津貼。</p>
<p>綜括周兼局長的表示，第（一）項是對於整頓警政的重視與堅明的決心。第（二）項對警察作極明顯的警誡。第（三）（四）（五）項具體保證提高待遇。周氏以警政主管畏官的地位，所說的話當然負有絕對責任。今後在警察立塲，生活旣有了保障，自應從此自肅，勉盡聯守。在市民立塲，當局旣有了明確表示，自應對過去不滿警察的觀念，從此轉換，更進而督促匡襄，以期强化警政，確立治安。</p>
<p>本來，警察爲公務人員中最接近民間者，所以，警察的任務最易使民間發生直接觀感，民間對於政治的信仰，從警祭的服務中最能收效。其次，警察爲內政的樞紐，大多數政令的推行，由警察傳遞民間。因此，良好的政令，必須有良好的警察執行，才可以獲致良好的效果。反之，縱有良好的政令，而無良好的警察，結果成效减少，警察與政治的關係重要旣如此，與民問的密切又如彼。因此，先進國家都以改良警察爲推進政治的先務。如盟邦日本對於警察制度向以嚴密完善著稱於世，今日政治修明，官民一體，發揮團結力量，其得力於警察行政的完善者，實爲主因之一。</p>
<p>就上海地位的重要，目前決戰局而的重要而言，警察除負有爲民師保推行政令的平時責任以外，尤須担負維護治安的戰時責任。誠如周兼局長：「警察的責任，非常重大，尤其際此戰時狀態，須確切維持地方治安，應直接間接適應戰時體制，協力總力戰」。所以，身爲上海市的警察者，目前負有雙重責任。我們對於警察，不但沒有歧視厭惡的心理，而且自始寄以股切的期待與重視，過去我們所不滿的，是警察風紀的敗壞，忘却了應有的任務，而形成普遍惡化的現象，雖曾屢加指摘，但也竭力主張一面提高待遇，一面整頓風紀，我們承認待遇不足生活，確是毀壞風紀的一因。所以，我們也曾協助當局促成警察消費合作社的成立。現在周兼市長不僅口頭表示提高待遇，而且已有具體的辦法，確切的保證，是則過去形成警紀敗壞的原因，可以從此消除。那末，全體警察自應懷於本身任務的綦重，政府的督責，與人民的期望，立即重振精神，自愛自重，洗除過去的弱點，一新今後的面目。這幾天勒索現象的減心以至絕跡，甚且有市民授賄而反遭拒絕嚴責的事例。我們相信這是市政上軌道的最好的轉捩點。</p>
<p>同時，我們更盼望當局於整頓稅收，充裕財源以後，更進一步提高警員待遇。另一方面對於灌輪警察新智識新技能，提高警察戰時認識，個個成爲現代警察，而克盡戰時責任，更是中高級警員的莫大任務，也是全體警政人員的光榮。</p>
<h3>泰相阿巴溫氏　電賀日首相　以不拔信念向前邁進</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日小磯首相與泰首相阿巴溫，於二十五日泰國參戰三周年紀念日，曾互致賀電，泰首相阿巴溫致日小磯首相之賀電，業於二十六日到達日外務省，要旨如下：泰國國民與日本政府及日本國民，同樣深信大東亞戰爭爲人道正義之戰爭，本諸大東亞會議所闡明之諸原則，以不拔之信念，排除一萬難？向共同目的邁進。本人衷心希冀日軍勝利，藉此以確立日本之繁榮及大東亞民族物心兩面之福社，最後特向閣下披瀝熱誠之期望友邦獲得戰爭之勝利。</p>
<h3>泰國參戰紀念　山本大使談話</h3>
<p>盤谷二十六日中央社電　泰國對美英宣戰以來，於茲三載，本月二十五日，適值參戰三周年紀念日，斯日於盤谷日泰兩國間，互表明完遂戰爭之決意。上午十時，日本大使訪問泰國外相西塞那，其時山本大使並作謝覆，謂泰國民以堅强之決意與忍耐，與日本緊密協力，決意完遂太業，爲達成共同目的，法盡所有努力，故以後過有任何因難與犧牲，共同繼續至獲最後勝利止。參戰以來，經過三年時光，今日吾等目的更瑧顯明，此次戰爭，乃決定東亞命運大戰，最後目的圓滿達成時，吾等各民族即可以大東亞會議時關明之道義爲基礎，確立和平世界，吾等把握此道義，誓向擊滅敵人之途邁進</p>
<h3>鮑斯主席發表　對印人熱望</h3>
<p>仰光二十六日中央社電　印度獨立聯盟以鮑斯滯留仰光之機，爲進一步昂揚緬印爭取獨立之決意，遂于鮑斯四十七歲誕辰之二十三日，于仰光舉行民衆大會，除祝福飽斯之健康外，更發楊東亞印人結集物心總力，爭取自由之士氣。飽斯于該大會席上說明世界戰局之趨勢，尤其力言日軍特別攻擊隊之英勇，軸心國攻勢時機業已到來，而表明獲得最後勝利之堅强信念，並切望全印人須效法日軍之特攻精神，排除戰局前途所有之困難，舉其總力，至獲最後之勝利爲止。</p>

<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾在最近一期「德國　週刋」發表一文稱，東綫洪流終必受到遏阻，即使敵人在西綫多方加以牽制，吾人亦將爲挽救本身及全世界文明，建立抵禦草原洪琉之大堤。蘇軍之大規模攻勢，今又暴露對整個歐陸之絕大危機，即其直接進攻中歐及間接進攻西歐是也。倘德軍不能遏阻其進展，其結果自不難想像知之，此不但攸關整個歐州，亦與全人類有關。故德國今日實爲世界而戰，其結果可間接或直接影響及文明人羣之命運，蓋蘇聯今欲以暴力使世界成爲共產國際。故德國此次作戰倘能獲勝，則自將爲全人類創一新時代，倘戰敗則西方之末日至矣。</p>
<h3>日隧道技術　足誇耀世界</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日本國有鐵道當局，鑒於最近戰局形勢，需土木技術人員組織地下建設部隊，　手國內重要設施之地域構築。就任地下建設本部次長之道業鐵道，頃談述日本之隧道技術，實足以誇耀世界。其最有力之證實，即丹那隧道之完成，突破多少難關，克服火山地帶牽有之高壓，完成世界最難之工程。又最近關於隧道之完成，亦係日本技術界不屈不撓之精神，日本國有鐵進隧道技術之躍進，殊爲驚人，如此之技術界，從今動員全機能，着手施行地下稱築，國民諸君請拭目以待可也。</p>
<h3>德政府闢謠</h3>

<h3>首都必需物資　規定平價範圍　包括米柴鹽油等七項</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　中樞當局爲抑平首都物價，決將設立「首都物資平價維紀委員會」，先就首都市區生活必需物資之米、柴、油、鑒、蔬菜、猪肉、鷄、鴨、魚等七項，着手本「遇結即解」，「見害便除」之旨趣，更以緊密督察，嚴正執法之精神，務求澈底達到暢通來源而抑平物價之目的。當局此種措置，對於民生之改善，裨益良深，想今後首都市區內生活必需品之價格，除以戰時一般因素而當然增漲外，餘均必能迅速恢復正常狀態，即一般物資，亦因之淤塞，亦得由高而平，由平而定。至關於該七項生活必需物資之實施方案，刻正經有關各方面縝密商治決定中，其中當以米價一項爲最重要，今後該會擬修改米糧統制辦法，解除城關封鎖，取消食米入城入公斤之限制數量，而使城外食米可販運入城暢通無阻。又素常供給南京食米之附近五縣即江寗、句容、渠水、江浦、六合之食米以及安徵之和縣、含山、宣城、蕪湖，當塗，高灣、無爲、巢縣等地之米，亦均可准自由輸京。又以往之「硬性限價」多使米商　拆成本，反致阻塞來源。今該會對該項措置，亦決予改善，對限價一節，當由負責評價之有關機關縝密研討，公定評議，綜合眞實之成本，與合法之利潤，當可使之合理化。又該會對食米統制辦法，一經修正後，無論官民，如有意圖營利，囤積居奇，足以妨書供求關係者，決依戰時刑事特別法第十七條，處以死刑，故切望市民對賞局之此項措置，務須自檢自肅，共同協力，完成戰時經濟體制，而達民生安定之目的。</p>
<h3>美海陸軍傷亡　逾七十一萬</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　據華盛頓電：美陸長史汀生昨日於會見記者團席上發表：自開戰以來至一月十四日止，美陸海軍之損害如次：陸軍損失六十一萬六千九百五十一名，海軍損失八萬四千九百九十五各，合計共損失七十一萬一千九百五十名。</p>
<p>里斯木二十六日中央社電　據舊金出電：美軍醫務總監加格二十四日於舊金山接見記者談稱，各戰綫之美國傷兵，總數每月約達十萬，其中乃至三萬五千送回本國，其餘於前綫醫院醫治病愈後，仍歸原隊服務。</p>
<p>美本年度戰費激增</p>
<p>馬德里二十六日中央社電　德國社訊，華盛頓息：一九四四年美政府戰費，爲九一·二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，較一九四三年增大百分之七，自一九四〇年以來，美消耗之戰費計共二四四·五〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。</p>
<h3>蘇聯向美商借鉅款</h3>
<p>里期本二十六日中央社電　海通社訊，紐約時報稱：蘇聯當局已向美政府商借六十萬萬美元，購賈機器，以爲戰後復興蘇聯工業之用，此項借款限期頗長，利息則甚低。美政府不久將討論此事，在國會未核准前，此事似不能有所決定。</p>
<h3>東線兩翼劇戰　德陣地穩固　沃特西岸蘇軍建橋頭堡</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍發言人昨評述東線戰况，預示布萊斯勞區在最近數日內，有演成大戰之可能，幷謂紅軍進攻納姆斯勞與奧爾斯，迄今皆遭擊退，但布萊斯勞城外之激戰似將難免。蘇軍佔領俄伯痕後，雖已獲渡過沃特河，在西岸建立二處小橋頭堡，但其渡河企圖，皆因發生苦戰而受頓挫。科塞爾·阿爾特哥塞爾·海伊台勃萊克三地現仍在德軍手中，蘇軍突入該處之先鋒隊皆巳予擊退。蘇軍在波森區自南面與東面兩路進攻華　倫地區，亦遭擊退。蘇軍自波森東北進攻希尼合莫爾，另有坦克車隊空入西普習士埃爾平城，亦即被德軍擊退。</p>
<p>布朗堡市激烈巷戰</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德國社訊：波森區蘇軍已於布朗堡大增壓力，並曾數度試渡尼芝河，但被擊退而蒙重創。布朗堡日夜均展開激烈之巷戰，德軍雖曾將敵驅至該市極南端，但旋即被迫後退至已經準備之陣地。</p>
<p>牽制戰略特殊意義</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：由戰略觀察東線兩翼之戰事，具有特殊之意義。德軍在兩方咸覊絆蘇軍，使之不能在貝斯基特與寇列希哈夫之問進行大規模攻勢。德援軍在洪都西北施行突襲，壓迫蘇軍勁旅退至多瑙河旁，洪都內力戰之守軍，亦覊絆相當人數之蘇軍在彼處作戰。柯蘭區力戰之德軍，使巴格拉浦指揮之二十五師蘇軍不能在東普書士東邊參戰，蘇軍長官因此不能使用里加灣爲海軍基地，此舉亦貝有重大意義。古拉科與康尼斯堡之間有大戰，二十四小時內軍事情况無主要變動</p>
<p>東普魯士大戰方酣</p>
<p>蘇軍企圖完全切斷東普魯士，其戰略有二：（一）蘇軍坦克隊及機械部隊由德意志艾勞方面衝入莫倫根迤南區，兩翼德軍反攻之結果，發生激戰。（二）蘇軍勁旅由布朗堡。托倫戰線進攻，企圖衝至但澤，蘇軍雖已衝入布朗堡，但未能發展原來之計劃。布朗堡運河與上西里西亞工業區內之戰事，異常猛烈，蘇軍人數續見增加，德生力軍亦調到前線作戰，阻敵前進。布一來斯勞迤東工業區之東北兩方現有大戰，波森區尤烈，德軍陣地益見强固。</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫　新國旗出現</h3>
<p>政治危機未去</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　海通社訊，紐約電台稱：南斯拉夫之新國旗，白地上配蘇維埃星，現已懸於紐約港之南斯拉夫貨船上，聞南國運輸部長巳通知所有南船照辦，反軸心國方面亦獲得此項通知。</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　德國社訊，倫敦消息：南流亡總理蘇巴希克昨晚第三次與南王彼得會見，內閣亦舉行第二次閣議。南流亡政府方面宣稱，現尚未獲最後決定，但談判之氣氛尚和睦，有妥協之可能。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：英國自治領大臣克蘭波勛爵向上議院宜稱，南斯拉夫流亡政府與國民解放委員會，倘不能成立協定，頗有發生內戰之危險。</p>

<h3>德軍西綫大攻勢</h3>
<p>去年十二月中旬開始的德軍新攻勢，進展非常順利，當時因柏林的國際電話連絡發生障礙，電報速絡亦甚困難，直到十二月二十一日黃昏，東京朝日新聞社才能與柏林分社通話，德軍攻勢眞相，至此始明。茲將朝日新聞社與該社柏林分社長守山氏的談話，迻譯如下。</p>
<p>徹底動員的結果</p>
<p>本社　德國終於發動攻勢了。在英美軍猛攻齊格斐防綫不下，彈藥兵員均感不數應用的時候開始，眞妙極了，就時期與塲所而言，的確很好</p>
<p>守山　不單我們這樣想，就在德國民衆間，也知道一味防守不能獲勝，相信德軍必定會發動攻勢的。自從一九四四年夏德軍從諸曼第半島撤退以來，他們早說有一天德軍必定要取攻勢的。果然，在十二月十六日那天終於發動了。大家都很欣慰。這次的攻勢是史太林格勒一役以來二年間最大的攻勢，所以一般德國人對它都有殷切的期待。德國的命運如何，可說也在此一舉，所以德國傾全力於這次的攻勢。此次攻勢，不妨着爲德國去年八月以來實施徹底動員的結果。</p>
<p>緘默攻勢的目標</p>
<p>本社　這次攻勢是不是爲了防守齊格斐的所謂防禦攻勢呢？</p>
<p>守山　據德國報章的記載，是爲了保衛德國國土，驅逐敵軍出境。可是單將敵軍逐出國境，尚不能够將戰局展開，所以必定要殲滅敵方的兵力，至少要殲滅一二個軍團的敵兵。或許德軍是想完全殲滅亞琛地區的敵兵的，不過關於此點，德國報紙還無消息透露，也不輕易對將來澦測，所以此次攻勢可說是「械默攻勢」。德國所以如此沉默，就是想用有力的事實來證明報道和宣傳。</p>
<p>本社　這次的攻勢中，德國已將徹底動員所獲的結果，作爲戰力而置諸第一綫吧？</p>
<p>守山　那是當然的事。自從一九四四年夏季以來，德國實行徹底動員，結果兵力遂有餘裕。過去凡參加重要產業的均可免除兵役，現在則二十歲到三十四萬的男子全部抽調出來，即使尙未完全徵調，至少已佔百分之幾十，由此就可增加不少兵員，少說也有幾十萬吧。至於國內的企業，當然因此要用女性來代替，工作效率或許會有幾分低下世未可知。不過，如此徹底的動員，總可編成一支大軍，少說也有幾個師團呢！</p>
<p>本社　將徹底動員而得的國民力量用在這次攻勢中，萬一遭遇非常的打擊時，不是有後續無人之憂嗎？</p>
<p>守山　這倒是切實的問題，我們也是這樣想。不過，德國國民必會使這次攻勢成功。據國的命運全繫於此次攻勢的結果，他們有無論如何非使它成功不可的氣魄。這次攻勢因爲是德國國內總力戰的結果，其成功與否，在軍事上固不用說，即在政治上將來也有重大影響。但總司令旣然是倫合特元帥，當然不會胸無成竹而昧然發動攻勢，所以這點是可以安心的。</p>
<p>新兵器陸續出現</p>
<p>本社　這一回的作戰，進行非常順利，是什麽原因呢？</p>
<p>守山　在新攻勢中顯示異常活躍的，是戰鬥機隊及戰車。德軍此次所用的戰車，有不少是最新式的，和以往活躍戰塲上的虎型戰車不同。此外，降落傘部隊在敵軍後方降下也是成功的。德軍的降落傘完全染黑，用來實行夜襲，發揮異常的威力。而且戰術上似乎也有大異昔日的新變革。總之，此次新攻勢之獲得奇襲的成功，關於攻擊的準備及作戰計劃能够確實保守機密，也是一個原因。例如該方面戰綫上的敵軍非常大意，而德軍則張弓以待，一到反攻開始，就怒濤似的進攻。正常美軍預備吃早飯的時候，德軍的戰車突然出現了。尤其是美國第一軍，自從在諾曼第上陸以來，最爲活躍，頗有自負不凡之慨，這次却碰了釘子。他們突然受到德軍的衝擊，張皇失措，不知如何是好。（譯自十二月三日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>剔除中飽　整理本市稅收　周市長昨召集財局幹部訓話</h3>
<p>周市長佛海於昨（二十六）日上午十時，在市府貴賓室召集市財政局各處處長，各科科長，各親察員，各專員等薦任以上人員訓話，計到羅兼財政局長君强，主任秘書徐頌平，秘書蔡雁賓，總務科長朱文元，會計主任　材武，特稅處長陳俊德，馬常路辦事處主任楊小佛等三十餘人，周市長於逐一垂詢各高級職員略歷後，即席致訓，辭意深刻嚴明，聽者無不感動。茲録原詞如下：</p>
<p>使命重大</p>
<p>「這次市政府改組，本人希望對上海市政有一番改革，爲人民做一點事。要改革市政，或做任何事情，必先肅正綱紀，樹立廉潔政治，但首先須顧到待遇之問題，但待遇之問題，要使人人廉潔，自須提高各人的待遇，但待遇之能否提高，要　財政之有無辦法，要使財政能有辦法，須看各位能否在職務上努力。是以各位所擔負使命之重大，不但爲本身職務之盡責而已，抑且負有能否樹立廉潔風氣之重大使命。各位的責任，可說比任何其他各處人員的責任更爲重大。</p>
<p>剔除中飽</p>
<p>羅兼局長就任以來，對於財政局人事並無任何更動，過去本人曾聽到各方面對各位很多不好的話，希望各位把過去不好的諸點，斷然去掉，要使財政有辦法，必須增加收入，但在此環境之下，要提高稅率，不但不可能，且本人不願再使人民之負擔增加，現在祗能從剔除中飽化私爲公的原則之下，去整理稅收。本人相信如能好好地把原來稅收加以整理，使本來被中飽之錢，完全歸公，即使不增稅，一定亦可以使稅收數額增加，即使人民所負擔的納稅數額與政府收入的數額相差不多，倘相差太多，即爲財政人員不健全的緣故，我們一定要做到兩者之間的距離相差不多。中間除了必要行政費開支以外，其他無任何之開支，這樣才能使人民所負擔的數額與政府實際上所收入的數額，兩者之間的距離接近。</p>
<p>今後努力</p>
<p>本人負責國民政府整個財政五年有餘，都本着十二分認眞態度努力去做，直到現在，不但使政府財政一點沒有虧空，並使國庫留存的數額，增加到三十萬萬元以上，這不是說過去作弊等情形，一點也沒有，總之，算是比較一般說得過去。如再進一步去努力，當然使國家的收入，亦可增加。今將以往財政部之精神推廣到本市財政局方面，此次請羅秘書長兼任同長，是因爲羅局長嚴明能幹，希望各位在他的領導之下，重革過去種種缺點，努力今後的職務。各位雖然過去不是在羅局長以下做事，但羅局長並不以爲各位過去不是他的部下，有所不能共同努力。這好比一位能幹的將領，不但要能帶自已部下的兵去打仗，而且要帶人家的兵去打仗，這才算是優秀的將領。譬如法國拿破崙將軍，他是善於利用這一點的，所以不一定要自己的人才能做事，倘能以公開的態度對待，不是自己的部下，也可一樣發揮極大的功效。各位都是舊的人員，過去都有很好的經騐，努力之機會甚多，倘能利用過去好的經騐，爲公而努力，一定能替國家盡很大責任，倘用在不好的方面，即能發生不好的事，亦可作不好的事，這要看各位能不能在羅兼局長領導之下，盡最大之努力，發生最大之功效。</p>
<p>提高待遇</p>
<p>今後市政之能不能做得好前不能做到廉潔政治，其責任一大半在各位身上。各位的責任旣如此重大，故本人最近與羅兼局長商量之下，打算財務人員之待邁，應該比其他各職人員，格外特別增高，因其所負責任特別重大，待遇當然要特別提高，因其所負責任重大，尤其希望各位要加倍努力，這樣才能使上海市財政制度，煥然一新，但待遇特別提高之後，倘然各位仍有其他不法行動或不法之事情發生，那是一點不需要考慮，是要拿法律來嚴厲制裁的。本人預光聲明，對於這種不法的人，是一些不用姑息，一些不用饒恕的，這不是本人故意危言聳聽，要肅淸綱紀，樹立廉潔風氣，非如此不可，同時希望各位把本人的話回去轉達給低下的職員，共同勉勵。」</p>

<h3>工廠配電　尙未決定</h3>

<p>敵人以中國爲　塲登陸云云，原無足奇，但事實上無此可能耳。茍欲作此企圖，必先以破攘日方之補充綫入手，菲島　事之矗炸，則其前例，而事實上殊匪易易。敵人如欲登陸，試問其兵力何在。新幾內亞及菲律賓方面，均無法抽調，故縱有在他處登陸之企圖，受此牽製，亦必　日持久。至於華南及海南島爲日軍之重要據點，防空陣之設備，異常鞏固，敵即來炸，決難得逞，尤其在台灣方面，　人如不得手，則　事亦將無法進行矣。</p>
<p>造謠生事不値一笑</p>
<p>揣測滬上之造謠者，其作用一爲從中圖利，二爲擾亂和平地區之治安，故所謂登陸及轟炸云云，亳無事實根據，以事理分析之，殊不值識者一笑。譬如敵人於二次空襲合灣時，市上忽有杭州灣敵軍登陸之謠傳，考造謠者之心理，乃聞得台灣被炸後，即以後者牽强附會，混而爲一也。同時又有人說美軍登陸之地點不一，方面甚多，另一說則有將在速雲港登陸云云，總之，謠言甚多甚多。所謂美軍登陸問題，如非其　絕大危險外，必須看菲島戰局如何而定其動向。日本方面則已在華南準備一切，作强有力之防禦工作矣。</p>
<p>襲滬敵機邀擊經過</p>
<p>田大尉對於最近美機襲滬日空軍之戰果，亦發表談話如次：十七日敵機十餘架襲滬，經日方擊落七架，擊毀五架，死傷華人兩名，此次日空軍　擊戰成績極好，實爲前此所未有，市民防空訓練方面，亦大見進步，已無從前因任意觀望，而致多人枉受死傷，此一點殊堪慶幸。此次襲滬敵機係二架或三架編隊，在空中對下用機槍掃射，幸市民尚無喪亡，搜尋敵機墜落地點及其殘該之工作，尚在進行中，已發現者貴浦西南方地上一架機身，　輕燒毀，駕駛員已斃命，吳　方面亦發現一架，南市居民曾目賭有美機三架，在極南處下墜，惟墜落之地點不明，虹橋西南方面，亦曾打下敵機，殘骸尚未找得。每次敵機來襲，日機必起飛邀擊，市民有時或以此爲美機則誤矣，蓋日機之兩蠶有紅徵，可以辨別也。目下滬市防空方面，更有進步，今後美機如再來襲，必蒙受極大損失。</p>

<h3>昨晚籃球聯賽　中北克汕隊　女子組三省勝華僑</h3>
<p>三屆籃球聯賽，昨晚中北報復申報杯失敗之仇，以四十一比三十擊敗汕隊，上半時二十比十三分。中北始終以七八分一路領先，競爭緊張劇烈，觀衆滿坑滿谷。汕隊以四比零佔先後，即未獲抬頭機曾。中北昨晚以理想陣容出戰，爲陳學崇沈聿恭李震中卓國榮包松圓，完全中華代表隊面目，穩定有把握。汕隊功候似尚欠一着，守衛甚佳，攻則不足，投籃爲得分關鍵，尤須下功夫也。V膝勝靑協，勞均力敵，V隊始終以數分領前，結果二十二比十九，上半時十比七。女子組三省膀華僑，三省究多老將，攻守俱佳，結果三十四比二十，上半時二十比七分。</p>

<h3>桃李遍天下</h3>
<p>盼熱心人盡力救濟</p>
<p>古人喻所　的賢士曰「桃李」，後世稱頌敎育家門生之衆，亦曰「桃李盈門」，韓詩外傳　主說：「夫春樹桃李，夏得蔭其下，秋得食其實；春樹蒺藜，夏不可採其葉，秋得其刺」。這意思形容「桃李」予人生的利益，確是很大。桃李到了夏季，長得枝葉茂盛，人們可在樹下納凉；到了秋季，果實櫐櫐，供人們採食，口福不淺。不但如此，春季桃李開花，又十分美艷，供人欣賞。至於「蒺藜」同樣在春季生長，枝葉有刺，不可採用，簡直是害人的　料。說到本報所資助的五千清寒學子，都是全級前列三分之一以內，而由校長負責推　，當然是最優秀的「桃李」，而不是「蒺藜」，他們現在正讀小學，初高中，專科以至大學，分散在全上海的學校，再過十年廿年，也門一定是分散於國內，努力復興建設的工作，所以說「桃李遍天下」。可惜目前他們都困於家境，無力入學，盼望有錢有力的熱心人，慷慨輸將，盡救濟扶助的責任。</p>
<p>大豐紙號義賣助學</p>

<h3>强化本市郊區治安</h3>
<p>— 得之</p>
<p>過去上海當局一切設施，偏重於市區之內，而本市所屬縣區及郊區，自兵煑之後，沒有好好建設過，連最根本的治安問題亦未完全確立，我以爲縣區和郊區有相同的重要，所以盼望當局加以整頓。</p>
<p>第一：上海的人口早已過飽和點，亟應從速疏數，郊區比較近便，易於疏啟。</p>
<p>第二：今後空戰勢勢將激烈，上海一部分工業及老弱最好疏散到四郊去。</p>
<p>第三：物價高漲、物實匱乏，已達最嚴重階段，郊區物價較低，生活較易，貧困人士亟應前往。</p>
<p>第四：最近各樂均大量裁員，失業份子將益增多，四郊農產向稱當庶，可利用失業人員的勞力，從事增加生產。</p>
<p>上面四點，足以證明郊區的重要性，可是因爲治安不能確立，所以我們熱望市政當局强化郊區治安，以推進疏散工作。</p>
<p>第一：整理保甲，郊區保甲組織頗多有名無實，戶口吵準確，而區·鄕·鎭·保·甲長等辦事尤多不力，故對於保甲長人選，應嚴密頸別，然後再加訓練，實行戶口總複查，並隨時厲行抽查。</p>
<p>第二：增强奮力，郊區警察及保安隊待遇極低，警備力量不免渙散，故須統籌警費，提高薪餉，並　汰不良份子，訓練新幹部以補充警額，並充實配備。</p>
<p>第三：普設自警，各鄕區應訓練壯丁，普遍組強自警團及巡邏隊，守望相助，以補警力之不足。</p>
<p>第四：澄淸毒須，現在郊於賭之風甚熾，害民傷財，莫此爲甚，對於治安大有影響，應從速剷除。</p>
<p>第五：除暴安良，鄕區頗不乏土豪劣紳，仗特殊勢力，敲詐勒索，魚肉人民，是項不良之徒之徒亟須取締，如有軍警勾結作惡，必繩以法，庶善良民衆得以安居樂業。</p>

<h3>The Noble House of Japan Opens a Plenary Session, Deciding to Revise Legal Proposals; The House of Representatives Budget General Meeting Announced its Conclusion Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Noble House of Japan held a plenary session on the morning of the 26th at 10:00 AM. Count Yoshinori Futara and others questioned the government's belief in the current war situation, the guidance of popular sentiment, fundamental countermeasures for Japanese thought, and concrete implementation strategies for the Greater East Asia Declaration. After Prime Minister Koiso's response, the formal session began. Subsequently, partial revisions to the Military Service Law and other revised legal proposals decided by various committees were presented sequentially. After being approved based on the committee chair's report, the decided legal proposals were sent to the House of Representatives, and the session adjourned.

<p>Establishing a Moral Nation and Society Based on the Spirit of Hakkō ichiu</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – During the plenary session of the Noble House of Japan, Count Yoshinori Futara questioned the concrete implementation of the Greater East Asia Declaration, stating that it has been over a year since the Greater East Asia Declaration, which serves as the foundation for uniting the one billion people of Greater East Asia, was proclaimed. However, there are still many inadequacies in its thorough implementation. Given the current circumstances, what specific measures does the government have to ensure that the Greater East Asia Declaration achieves practical results? Prime Minister Koiso responded as follows: Regardless of how the war situation unfolds, it is essential to firmly establish a moral nation and society based on the spirit of autonomy, independence, and Hakkō ichiu. The government authorities will ensure that Japanese military officials and civilians in various localities first embody the imperial way spirit of Hakkō ichiu themselves. They will also actively enlighten the people of allied nations in close proximity, who deeply anticipate this effort. Simultaneously, during opportunities for leaders of allied nations to visit Japan, they will engage in friendly exchanges and enthusiastically emphasize the importance of this ideal based on their own experiences, to gain their understanding and resonance, and achieve this objective.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – At this intense stage of the war, the Japanese scientific community can easily contribute to wartime capabilities. Regarding this matter, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso emphatically stated the following during a response to questions at the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the 25th: The mobilization of science and technology is steadily progressing. I sincerely hope that the advancement of the scientific community can be maintained, and that we can grasp the belief in victory in this war.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Revises Rules for Exchanging Savings Certificates</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Director of the Japanese Governor-General's Department in Hong Kong has expanded the exchange limit for Central Reserve Bank of China notes (儲劵), in order to facilitate financial circulation between Hong Kong and Guangdong. The revised exchange rules have been promulgated and implemented on the 18th. The main purpose of the revision is to ease restrictions on exchange rates and currency circulation between the two regions. Previously, the exchange of military scrip and Central Reserve Bank of China notes was limited to 500 yuan without requiring permission. This has now been increased to 1,000 yuan. The amount of military scrip and Central Reserve Bank of China notes that can be carried into the jurisdiction has also been increased from 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Furthermore, to strengthen self-sufficiency, active efforts are being made to mobilize and diversify production facilities. The Governor-General's Department of Commerce and Industry has decided to actively encourage the production of daily necessities for import and exchange, in addition to military supplies. The combination of exchange goods production will be promoted in a planned manner. A survey will be conducted on traders with capital of 100,000 yuan or more regarding the exchange goods they desire. Based on the results of the survey, a decision will be made on the most desired goods, and a designated factory system will be implemented according to the situation.</p>
<h3>Manchuria Decides to Increase Castor Bean Production This Year</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Castor beans, being a raw material for aircraft lubricating oil and a liquid fuel like gasoline, are an important wartime fuel. Manchuria's production increase campaign yielded a total of 1,200 tons last year, a result that was not very satisfactory. Therefore, this year, the central government has decided to implement a responsibility system, with a minimum production target of 10,000 tons. The planting method will be generally the same as last year. Currently, schools, government offices, and organizations are planting as much as possible in parks, gardens, and other vacant land. The authorities will provide commendations to those with excellent results, as a form of encouragement.</p>
<h3>Manchuria Purchases Platinum</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Since the Manchurian government began purchasing platinum last October, many private citizens have sold their platinum. However, there are still many who have not complied. Therefore, the Manchurian Economic Ministry announced the platinum purchase decree in December of last year, requiring all holders of platinum to sell it to the government before the end of January, or face severe penalties.</p>

<h3>The Truth About Enemy American Aircraft Attacking Macau</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The truth behind the American air raid on Macau in four waves on the 16th has been investigated as follows: At 9:30 AM that morning, American aircraft intruded into Macau airspace and circled for several weeks before flying low to bomb the aircraft hangar of the New Seamount Government. They then strafed with machine guns and small cannons, before flying over the border. Ten minutes later, they attacked again, with the same target of the airfield, for about ten minutes before leaving. Shortly after, they made a third air raid, causing bombs to destroy the vicinity of the hangar. The gasoline depot at the airfield was also hit and caught fire, burning fiercely. According to Kao Sze-teh of the Secretariat, a total of 5,000 to 6,000 gallons of gasoline were destroyed. In addition to dispatching firefighters, the Macau government sent officials in the Governor's vehicle to investigate, but they were all hit by machine gun fire from the American aircraft. Furthermore, the American aircraft dropped bombs and strafed the Portuguese transport ship "Ma Shi Ti", anchored near Qiongzhou, in front of the Nam Van copper foundry. Government agencies, radio stations, and the power plant's machine shop and oil tanks on Song Mountain were also hit by bombs and strafed. The Macau authorities are extremely indignant at this unreasonable act and telegraphed Lisbon yesterday to report everything, preparing to negotiate.</p>
<p>Capital Correspondence</p>
<h3>Chairman Chen's Principles of Governing the Nation</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Dan Ming</p>
<p>Following the passing of the late Chairman Wang, the entire nation, under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, is entering a new stage to meet the needs of the current situation. Undoubtedly, at this decisive juncture in the world war, being able to obtain a new, strong, and resolute leader to continue to realize and further promote the unfinished aspirations of the late Chairman Wang, the prospects for the future are certainly predictable. I, the reporter, was ordered to pay respects to Acting Chairman Chen. The acting chairman received me at his official residence on Beiping Road at 4:00 PM on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>In fact, I, the reporter, was once a subordinate of Acting Chairman Chen. In my memory, Acting Chairman Chen has always seemed like a "giant of iron," like Stalin. Since he was honorably appointed as the acting chairman of the National Government, this is my first audience with him. I think most people have long known that Mr. Chen is the most practical person in our country today. He has never liked to make any empty or unrealistic discussions. I think this is the first time a news reporter has been received since he became acting chairman. When I requested a twenty-minute conversation, he agreed very readily. That kind of clear, firm demeanor is probably unmatched in China today!</p>
<p>Realizing the Late Chairman's Aspirations</p>
<p>"After the chairman led the nation into a new era of decisive battles," the reporter asked directly, "I wonder how Sino-Japanese relations will evolve?"</p>
<p>"Just as I said when I took office on November 20th last year," Acting Chairman Chen replied without hesitation, "I am determined to thoroughly realize the late Chairman Wang's aspirations."</p>
<p>"What are the so-called aspirations of the late Chairman Wang? First, it is to participate in the war. To be honest, our country's participation in the war is voluntary and has not been promoted by anyone. Why? First, our country has been invaded by Britain and the United States for a long time, and only by taking this opportunity can we make our country get rid of the tendency of being colonized; second, after our country participates in the war, it can improve its national status, express our country's determination to cooperate with the allied countries, and thus discover a new future."</p>
<p>"However, at this time," the reporter said, "the people's livelihood is really too hard. I don't know what kind of economic measures can be taken?"</p>
<p>"This is the second point I want to point out," Acting Chairman Chen continued, "In this era, we cannot talk about politics without economics. Therefore, I am determined to cooperate with the allied countries to thoroughly solve the problem of the amount of currency issuance."</p>
<p>"How to solve the problem of currency issuance?" the reporter asked, "Currently, the government has to increase taxes, and civil servants have to seek salary increases every day. If prices continue to rise, it may be very difficult to solve. Moreover, after the government increases taxes, it will cyclically stimulate price increases."</p>
<p>"That's not the most important thing," the acting chairman said with a smile, "The important thing is how to regulate currency issuance, in other words, to limit currency issuance to an appropriate level, because this issue is clearly closely related to production. I can responsibly tell you that we are now conducting practical research with the allied countries, and this problem will definitely be solved in the shortest possible time."</p>
<p>"The last point is peaceful unification. These three points are the late Chairman Wang's aspirations. Under any circumstances, I will definitely try to fully realize them. I have firmly told the allied countries that the unification of China must be maintained no matter what. I vow not to allow any division of China. Therefore, as long as I am in office for one day, I must do my best to completely eliminate any phenomenon of disunity, no matter how difficult the environment."</p>
<p>Domestic Reform</p>
<p>Seeing Acting Chairman Chen talking so excitedly, the reporter's spirits were also greatly lifted. Although there were other guests waiting outside, the conversation continued.</p>
<p>"Regarding domestic affairs," the conversation took a turn, "I wonder how the chairman will start to reorganize?"</p>
<p>"This is my old saying of incorruptible politics," Acting Chairman Chen said eloquently, "I have already decided to clarify officialdom in the near future."</p>
<p>"How will it start and how will it proceed?" I asked:</p>
<p>"Of course, we must take into account the actual situation," he said, "In the past, I governed Shanghai for several years, and the result was very painful to me. Because the environment there was too complicated, I did not achieve my expected goals. However, the situation here in the capital is different. I am prepared to do something thoroughly here first. I have already convened the Minister of the Army, the Commander of the Military Police, the Chief of Police, and the Mayor to discuss it. I heard that many of the military police here cannot justify themselves. I am prepared to give them a special allowance of 90 million yuan per month starting next month. If there is still corruption after next month, they will all be shot without leniency."</p>
<p>"The chairman's determination is exactly what Mr. Deng Sishi said about the comfort of being on a mat." The reporter interjected.</p>
<p>"Because it is not enough to create a good atmosphere if it is not like this."</p>
<p>"To create a good atmosphere," I asked again, "In addition to using severe punishment, it seems that we should also pay attention to the national morality of the whole country. I wonder what the chairman thinks of the new national movement that is currently being promoted?"</p>
<p>"I think," Mr. Chen replied, "The best thing to do with the new national movement is to simplify the goals and cultivate the national group action from this. The people of our country originally rarely talk about unity, which is really an important disease."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the reporter reported that he was ordered to go to various places in northern Jiangsu to investigate the day after tomorrow, and perhaps he could provide him with some information on reforming county administration.</p>
<p>"Are you going alone?" Acting Chairman Chen was very excited when he heard this: "If you have any difficulties, you can ask for the cooperation of the local military police. When you come back, I would be very willing to hear your conclusions."</p>
<p>At this point, he excused himself, and in the dim twilight, the reporter, full of enthusiasm, walked out of this simple official residence.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Revitalizing the New Spirit of the Police</h3>
<p>When Police Chief Zhou convened a meeting of senior police officers on the 24th, he stated (1) that he was taking office as mayor and concurrently as police chief this time with the greatest determination to rectify police affairs and that this was his only task; (2) that the police must never again cause trouble for the people or solicit bribes, otherwise, once verified, they would never be tolerated and would be severely punished; (3) that the treatment of police officers would be improved from February 1, and that the allocation of food rice would be distributed free of charge from that time, with each person receiving at least three dou, and that salaries would also be increased appropriately; (4) that the police consumer cooperative would be expanded, increasing its capital by 100 million yuan, and that the procurement and allocation work would be strengthened as much as possible, and that all kinds of daily necessities would be procured and allocated as much as possible to stabilize the lives of the police; (5) that he would prepare to issue confidential fees or travel expenses to the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the bureaus, the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the sub-bureaus, and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the sections, in order to subsidize them.</p>
<p>To sum up, Police Chief Zhou's statements, item (1) is the importance and clear determination to rectify police affairs. Item (2) is a very clear warning to the police. Items (3), (4), and (5) are concrete guarantees to improve treatment. Mr. Zhou, as the head of the police, of course, bears absolute responsibility for what he said. In the future, with the police having security in their position and life, they should from now on be self-disciplined and do their best to maintain their duties. From the position of the citizens, since the authorities have made a clear statement, they should from now on transform their past dissatisfaction with the police and further supervise and assist them in order to strengthen police affairs and establish public security.</p>
<p>Originally, the police are the most close to the people among the civil servants, so the tasks of the police are most likely to make the people have direct impressions, and the people's belief in politics can be most effective from the service of the police. Secondly, the police are the hub of internal affairs, and most of the implementation of government orders is transmitted to the people by the police. Therefore, good government orders must be executed by good police in order to achieve good results. On the contrary, even if there are good government orders, but there are no good police, the result is reduced effectiveness. The relationship between the police and politics is so important, and the closeness to the people is also like that. Therefore, advanced countries all take improving the police as the first priority in promoting politics. For example, the allied country Japan is famous in the world for its strict and perfect police system. Today, politics is enlightened, and officials and people are united, giving full play to the power of unity. The perfection of police administration is one of the main reasons for this.</p>
<p>In terms of the importance of Shanghai's position and the importance of the current decisive battle situation, the police, in addition to the peacetime responsibility of being teachers and protectors of the people and promoting government orders, must also bear the wartime responsibility of maintaining public security. As Police Chief Zhou said, "The responsibility of the police is very important, especially in this wartime state. We must ensure the maintenance of local public security, directly and indirectly adapt to the wartime system, and cooperate in the total war." Therefore, the police in Shanghai are currently shouldering a dual responsibility. We not only do not have a discriminatory or disgusted psychology towards the police, but also from the beginning place great expectations and importance on them. What we were dissatisfied with in the past was the corruption of the police discipline, forgetting the duties that should have been fulfilled, and forming a widespread deterioration phenomenon. Although we have repeatedly criticized them, we have also tried our best to advocate improving treatment on the one hand and rectifying discipline on the other hand. We admit that insufficient treatment for life is indeed one of the reasons for destroying discipline. Therefore, we have also assisted the authorities in promoting the establishment of the police consumer cooperative. Now, Mayor Zhou not only verbally expressed improving treatment, but also has concrete measures and definite guarantees, which means that the reasons that formed the corruption of police discipline in the past can be eliminated from now on. Then, all the police should immediately revitalize their spirits, cherish and respect themselves, wash away the weaknesses of the past, and renew their appearance from now on, bearing in mind the importance of their own tasks, the supervision of the government, and the expectations of the people. The reduction and even disappearance of extortion phenomena in the past few days, and even the fact that citizens who offered bribes were rejected and severely reprimanded, are the best turning points for the city to get on the right track.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also hope that the authorities will further improve the treatment of police officers after rectifying tax collection and enriching financial resources. On the other hand, it is the great task of the middle and senior police officers, and also the glory of all police personnel, to instill new knowledge and skills into the police, improve the wartime understanding of the police, and make everyone a modern police officer, so as to fulfill the wartime responsibility.</p>
<h3>Thai Prime Minister Apaiwong Conveys Telegram of Congratulations to Japanese Prime Minister, For Marching Forward with Unwavering Conviction</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso and Thai Prime Minister Apaiwong exchanged congratulatory telegrams on the third anniversary of Thailand's entry into the war on the 25th. The telegram of congratulations from Thai Prime Minister Apaiwong to Japanese Prime Minister Koiso arrived at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 26th. The main points are as follows: The Thai people, like the Japanese government and the Japanese people, firmly believe that the Greater East Asia War is a war for humanity and justice. Based on the principles elucidated in the Greater East Asia Conference, they will overcome all difficulties and advance towards a common goal with unwavering conviction. I sincerely hope for the victory of the Japanese army, thereby establishing Japan's prosperity and the material and spiritual well-being of the peoples of Greater East Asia. Finally, I extend to Your Excellency the sincere hope that the friendly nations will achieve victory in the war.</p>
<h3>Thailand Commemorates Entry into the War, Ambassador Yamamoto Speaks</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – It has been three years since Thailand declared war on the United States and Britain. On the 25th of this month, the third anniversary of the entry into the war was commemorated. On this day, both Japan and Thailand expressed their determination to complete the war in Bangkok. At 10:00 AM, the Japanese ambassador visited Thai Foreign Minister Sirisena, and Ambassador Yamamoto made a reply, saying that the Thai people, with strong determination and patience, are closely cooperating with Japan and are determined to complete the great cause. In order to achieve the common goal, they will do their best. Therefore, no matter what difficulties and sacrifices there may be in the future, they will continue together until the final victory. Three years have passed since the entry into the war, and today our goal is even clearer. This war is a great war that determines the fate of East Asia. When the final goal is successfully achieved, our nations can establish a peaceful world based on the morality clarified at the Greater East Asia Conference. We will grasp this morality and vow to march towards the path of defeating the enemy.</p>
<h3>Chairman Bose Expresses Ardent Hopes for the Indian People</h3>
<p>Yangon, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Taking the opportunity of Bose's stay in Yangon, the Indian Independence League held a mass rally in Yangon on the 23rd, Bose's 47th birthday, to further uplift the determination of Myanmar and India to strive for independence. In addition to blessing Bose's health, they also promoted the spirit of the Indians in East Asia to gather their material and spiritual strength to strive for freedom. Bose explained the trend of the world war at the rally, especially emphasizing the bravery of the Japanese special attack teams, and stating that the time for the Axis powers' offensive has arrived, and expressed his strong belief in achieving final victory. He also earnestly hoped that all Indians must emulate the special attack spirit of the Japanese army, eliminate all difficulties in the future of the war, and exert their total strength until they achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>The Outcome of Germany's War Determines the Fate of Europe, Goebbels is Confident that He Can Stop the Flood</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the latest issue of "Germany Weekly" stating that the Eastern Front's flood will eventually be contained. Even if the enemy tries to contain it on the Western Front in many ways, we will build a dike to resist the grasslands of Ryukyu in order to save ourselves and the civilization of the whole world. The large-scale offensive of the Soviet army has now exposed the great crisis for the entire European continent, that is, its direct attack on Central Europe and its indirect attack on Western Europe. If the German army cannot contain its advance, the consequences can be easily imagined. This not only concerns the whole of Europe, but also the whole of mankind. Therefore, Germany is fighting for the world today, and its outcome can directly or indirectly affect the fate of civilized people, because the Soviet Union now wants to use violence to make the world a Communist International. Therefore, if Germany can win this war, it will create a new era for all mankind. If it loses, the end of the West will come.</p>
<h3>Japanese Tunnel Technology: Worthy of Boasting to the World</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese National Railways authorities, in light of the recent war situation, have found it necessary for civil engineering technicians to organize underground construction units to undertake the regional construction of important domestic facilities. Michiya Tetsudo, who has been appointed Deputy Director of the Underground Construction Headquarters, recently stated that Japan's tunnel technology is truly worthy of boasting to the world. The most powerful proof of this is the completion of the Tanna Tunnel, overcoming numerous difficulties, including the high pressure associated with volcanic areas, and completing the world's most difficult project. Furthermore, the recent completion of the tunnel is also due to the indomitable spirit of the Japanese technological community. The advancements in Japanese National Railways tunnel technology are truly astonishing. This technological community, now mobilizing its full capabilities and undertaking underground construction, deserves the close attention of the nation's citizens.</p>
<h3>German Government Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: A German government spokesman declared that rumors that the former German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, had gone to Spain to explore peace talks are completely unfounded and not even worthy of denial.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Cultural Association to Send Students to Japan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, in order to promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, plans to send outstanding students to Japan for study.

<h3>Price Ceiling Set for Essential Goods in the Capital, Including Rice, Firewood, Salt, Oil, and Seven Other Items</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - To stabilize prices in the capital, the central authorities have decided to establish a "Capital Essential Goods Price Stabilization Committee." Starting with seven essential goods for daily life in the capital city area, including rice, firewood, oil, salt, vegetables, pork, chicken, duck, and fish, the committee will adhere to the principles of "resolving issues immediately" and "eliminating harm upon detection." It will also employ strict supervision and rigorous enforcement to thoroughly achieve the goal of ensuring smooth supply and stabilizing prices. This measure by the authorities will greatly benefit the improvement of people's livelihoods. It is expected that the prices of essential goods in the capital city area will, in addition to the inevitable increase due to general wartime factors, be able to quickly return to a normal state. The congestion of general goods will also be alleviated, leading to prices falling from high levels to more stable ones. The implementation plan for the seven essential goods is currently being carefully discussed and decided upon by relevant parties. Among them, the rice price is the most important. In the future, the committee plans to revise the rice control measures, lift the city gate blockade, and remove the restrictions on the amount of rice that can be brought into the city per kilogram, so that rice from outside the city can be transported into the city without hindrance. Furthermore, rice from the five nearby counties that usually supply Nanjing, namely Jiangning, Jurong, Lishui, Jiangpu, and Liuhe, as well as rice from He County, Hanshan, Xuancheng, Wuhu, Dangtu, Gaowan, Wuwei, and Chaoxian in Anhui Province, will also be allowed to be freely transported to the capital. In the past, "rigid price limits" often caused rice merchants to lose money, which in turn obstructed supply. The committee has decided to improve this measure as well. The price limits will be carefully researched and publicly discussed by relevant agencies responsible for price assessment, taking into account the true costs and legitimate profits, so that they can be rationalized. Once the committee's rice control measures are revised, anyone, whether official or civilian, who intends to profit by hoarding and manipulating the market to disrupt supply and demand will be punished by death in accordance with Article 17 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that citizens will exercise self-discipline, cooperate with the authorities in this measure, and work together to complete the wartime economic system and achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>US Army and Navy Casualties Exceed 710,000</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch: US Secretary of War Stimson announced yesterday at a meeting with reporters that from the start of the war until January 14th, the US Army and Navy casualties were as follows: Army losses were 616,951, Navy losses were 84,995, totaling 711,950.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a San Francisco dispatch: US Surgeon General Kirk stated in an interview with reporters in San Francisco on the 24th that the total number of American wounded soldiers on all fronts is approximately 100,000 per month, of which 35,000 are sent back to the country, and the rest are treated in front-line hospitals and return to their original units after recovery.</p>
<p>US War Expenses Increase Sharply This Year</p>
<p>Madrid, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency, Washington: The US government's war expenses for 1944 are $91.2 billion, an increase of 7% compared to 1943. Since 1940, the total war expenses consumed by the US have amounted to $244.5 billion.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Borrows Large Sum from American Businesses</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: The New York Times reported that the Soviet authorities have borrowed $6 billion from the US government to purchase machinery for the postwar reconstruction of Soviet industry. The loan term is quite long, and the interest rate is very low. The US government will discuss this matter soon, but it appears that no decision can be made until it is approved by Congress.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on Eastern Front's Flanks; German Positions Solid; Soviet Forces Establish Bridgehead on Warta River's West Bank</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: A German military spokesman commented on the situation on the Eastern Front yesterday, predicting that the Breslau area may develop into a major battle in the coming days. He also stated that the Red Army's attacks on Namslau and Oels have been repelled so far, but fierce fighting outside Breslau city seems unavoidable. Although Soviet forces occupied Ober-Glogau and crossed the Warta River, establishing two small bridgeheads on the west bank, their attempts to cross the river have been thwarted by fierce battles. Kosel, Altheidelberg, and Heydebreck are still in German hands, and the Soviet vanguard forces that broke into these areas have been repelled. Soviet forces also attacked the Wohlau area from the south and east in the Posen region, but were also repelled. Soviet forces attacked Schrimm from the northeast of Posen, and another tank force entered the city of Zempelburg, but were also repelled by German forces.</p>
<p>Fierce Street Fighting in Bromberg</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Soviet forces in the Posen region have greatly increased pressure on Bromberg and have repeatedly attempted to cross the Netze River, but were repelled and suffered heavy losses. Fierce street fighting is taking place in Bromberg day and night. Although German forces once drove the enemy to the southernmost tip of the city, they were soon forced to retreat to prepared positions.</p>
<p>Special Significance of Containment Strategy</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: Strategically observing the battles on the flanks of the Eastern Front has special significance. German forces on both sides are holding back Soviet forces, preventing them from launching large-scale offensives between the Beskid Mountains and Kovel. German reinforcements launched a surprise attack northwest of Hondo, forcing the main Soviet forces to retreat to the Danube River. The defending forces fighting fiercely in Hondo are also holding back a considerable number of Soviet forces. The German forces fighting fiercely in the Kuran area are preventing the 25th Soviet Division under Bagratian from participating in the war east of East Prussia. The Soviet commander is therefore unable to use the Gulf of Riga as a naval base, which is also of great significance. There is a major battle between Kulakov and Königsberg, and there have been no major changes in the military situation in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Major Battle Raging in East Prussia</p>
<p>Soviet forces are attempting to completely cut off East Prussia. Their strategy has two parts: (1) Soviet tank units and mechanized units are charging into the area south of Mohrungen from Deutsch Eylau. As a result of the German forces' counterattacks on both flanks, fierce battles have broken out. (2) Main Soviet forces are attacking from the Bromberg-Thorn line, attempting to reach Danzig. Although Soviet forces have broken into Bromberg, they have not been able to develop their original plan. The battles in the Bromberg Canal and the Upper Silesian industrial area are extremely fierce. The number of Soviet troops continues to increase, and German reinforcements have also been transferred to the front to stop the enemy's advance. There are major battles northeast of the industrial area east of Breslau, especially in the Posen region. German positions are becoming increasingly fortified.</p>
<h3>New Yugoslav Flag Appears</h3>
<p>Political Crisis Remains</p>

<h3>German Army's Major Offensive on the Western Front</h3>
<p>The new German offensive, which began in mid-December last year, progressed very smoothly. At that time, international telephone connections in Berlin were disrupted, and telegram communications were also very difficult. It was not until the evening of December 21 that the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun was able to communicate with its Berlin branch office, and the true situation of the German offensive became clear. The following is a translation of the conversation between the Asahi Shimbun and Mr. Moriyama, the head of its Berlin branch office.</p>
<p>Result of Thorough Mobilization</p>
<p>Headquarters: Germany has finally launched an offensive. It started when the British and American forces were fiercely attacking the Siegfried Line without success and were running out of ammunition and manpower. It's truly amazing. In terms of timing and location, it's indeed very good.</p>
<p>Moriyama: Not only do we think so, but the German people also know that defense alone cannot win, and they believe that the German army will definitely launch an offensive. Ever since the German army withdrew from the Cotentin Peninsula in the summer of 1944, they had been saying that one day the German army would definitely take the offensive. Sure enough, it finally launched on December 16. Everyone is very pleased. This offensive is the largest offensive in the two years since the Battle of Stalingrad, so the general German people have high expectations for it. It can be said that the fate of Germany depends on this move, so Germany is pouring all its efforts into this offensive. This offensive can be regarded as the result of Germany's thorough mobilization since August last year.</p>
<p>The Goal of the Silent Offensive</p>
<p>Headquarters: Is this offensive a so-called defensive offensive to defend the Siegfried Line?</p>
<p>Moriyama: According to German newspapers, it is to defend German territory and drive the enemy out of the country. However, simply driving the enemy out of the country is not enough to turn the tide of the war, so it is necessary to annihilate the enemy's forces, at least one or two army corps. Perhaps the German army wants to completely annihilate the enemy in the Aachen area, but there is no news about this in German newspapers, and they are not easily making predictions about the future, so this offensive can be said to be a "silent offensive." The reason why Germany is so silent is to prove its reports and propaganda with powerful facts.</p>
<p>Headquarters: In this offensive, Germany has put the results of its thorough mobilization into the front line as combat power, right?</p>
<p>Moriyama: That's for sure. Since the summer of 1944, Germany has implemented thorough mobilization, and as a result, it has a surplus of manpower. In the past, anyone who participated in important industries could be exempted from military service, but now all men between the ages of twenty and thirty-four are being drafted. Even if they have not been completely drafted, at least tens of percent have been, which can increase the number of soldiers by no small amount, at least several hundred thousand. As for domestic enterprises, of course, women will have to be used to replace them, and work efficiency may be somewhat lower. However, such thorough mobilization can always form a large army, at least several divisions!</p>
<p>Headquarters: If the national power gained through thorough mobilization is used in this offensive, wouldn't there be a concern that there will be no one to follow up in case of a major setback?</p>
<p>Moriyama: That is a real question, and we think so too. However, the German people will definitely make this offensive a success. According to them, the fate of the country depends entirely on the outcome of this offensive, and they have the spirit to make it a success no matter what. Because this offensive is the result of Germany's total war effort, its success or failure will have a major impact on the future, not only militarily but also politically. However, since the commander-in-chief is Field Marshal Rundstedt, he certainly would not launch an offensive without a clear plan, so this is something to be reassured about.</p>
<p>New Weapons Appear One After Another</p>
<p>Headquarters: This operation has been going very smoothly. What is the reason?</p>
<p>Moriyama: What has been showing extraordinary activity in the new offensive is the fighter squadron and tanks. Many of the tanks used by the German army this time are the latest models, different from the Tiger tanks that were active on the battlefield in the past. In addition, the paratroopers who landed behind enemy lines were also successful. The German parachutes are completely dyed black and used for night attacks, displaying extraordinary power. Moreover, there seems to be a major new transformation in tactics that is different from the past. In short, one reason for the success of this new offensive in achieving surprise is that the preparations for the attack and the operational plan were able to be kept secret. For example, the enemy on that front was very careless, while the German army was waiting with bated breath. As soon as the counter-offensive began, it attacked like a raging wave. Just as the American army was preparing to eat breakfast, German tanks suddenly appeared. Especially the US First Army, which had been most active since landing in Normandy and was quite proud of itself, ran into a snag this time. They were suddenly shocked by the German attack and panicked, not knowing what to do. (Translated from the December 3 Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Eliminating Embezzlement and Reorganizing Municipal Tax Revenue: Mayor Zhou Addresses Financial Bureau Officials</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 26th) at 10:00 AM, Mayor Zhou Fohai convened a meeting in the Municipal Government's reception room to address officials of the Municipal Finance Bureau at the rank of Senior Clerk and above, including the heads of each division, section chiefs, inspectors, and specialists. Present were approximately 30 people, including Luo Junqiang, the concurrently serving Director of Finance; Xu Songping, the Chief Secretary; Cai Yanbin, a secretary; Zhu Wenyuan, the Chief of the General Affairs Section; Cai Wu, the Head of Accounting; Chen Junde, the Director of the Special Tax Bureau; and Yang Xiaofo, the Director of the Ma Chang Road Office. After inquiring about the backgrounds of each senior official, Mayor Zhou delivered an earnest and clear speech that moved all who listened. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Significant Mission</p>
<p>"With this reorganization of the Municipal Government, I hope to bring about reforms to Shanghai's municipal administration and do something for the people. To reform municipal administration, or to do anything, we must first rectify discipline and establish a clean and honest government. But first, we must consider the issue of compensation. To ensure everyone is honest, we must increase everyone's compensation. However, the ability to increase compensation depends on whether or not the finances are sound. And to ensure the finances are sound, it depends on whether you all can work diligently in your positions. Therefore, the mission you shoulder is not only about fulfilling your own duties, but also about bearing the significant responsibility of establishing a clean and honest atmosphere. It can be said that your responsibilities are even greater than those of personnel in other departments.</p>
<p>Eliminating Embezzlement</p>
<p>Since Director Luo took office, there have been no changes to the Finance Bureau's personnel. In the past, I have heard many negative things about you all from various sources. I hope that you will resolutely eliminate those negative aspects of the past. To ensure the finances are sound, we must increase revenue. However, under the current circumstances, raising tax rates is not only impossible, but I also do not want to increase the burden on the people. Now, we can only reorganize tax revenue based on the principle of eliminating embezzlement and turning private gain into public benefit. I believe that if we can properly reorganize the existing tax revenue and ensure that the money that was originally embezzled is entirely returned to the public treasury, we can increase the amount of tax revenue even without increasing taxes. If the amount of taxes borne by the people and the amount of revenue received by the government are not too different, but if there is a big difference, it means that the financial personnel are unsound. We must ensure that the distance between the two is not too great. Aside from the necessary administrative expenses, there should be no other expenses. Only in this way can the amount borne by the people and the amount actually received by the government be closer.</p>
<p>Future Efforts</p>
<p>For more than five years, I was responsible for the entire finances of the National Government, and I made every effort to do so with a sincere attitude. Until now, not only has the government's finances not been in deficit, but the amount left in the national treasury has increased to more than 300 million yuan. This is not to say that there was no corruption or other improprieties in the past, but overall, it can be considered relatively acceptable. If we make further efforts, the country's revenue can certainly be increased. Now, I am extending the spirit of the former Ministry of Finance to the municipal Finance Bureau. The reason for asking Secretary-General Luo to concurrently serve as Director is because Director Luo is strict, fair, and capable. I hope that under his leadership, you will reform the various shortcomings of the past and work hard in your future duties. Although you have not worked under Director Luo in the past, Director Luo does not think that you cannot work together because you were not his subordinates in the past. This is like a capable general who must not only be able to lead his own troops to fight, but also be able to lead other people's troops to fight. That is what counts as an outstanding general. For example, the French General Napoleon was good at utilizing this point. Therefore, it is not necessary for only one's own people to be able to do things. If you can treat people with an open attitude, even if they are not your subordinates, they can still exert great effects. You are all experienced personnel, and you have many opportunities to work hard. If you can use your past good experience and work hard for the public good, you will certainly be able to fulfill a great responsibility for the country. If you use it in a bad way, you can do bad things and cause bad things to happen. It depends on whether you can work hard under the leadership of Director Luo and exert the greatest effect.</p>
<p>Increased Compensation</p>
<p>In the future, whether municipal administration can be done well and whether clean and honest politics can be achieved depends largely on you. Since your responsibilities are so great, I have recently discussed with Director Luo and decided that the compensation of financial personnel should be specially increased compared to other staff, because their responsibilities are particularly heavy, and their compensation should naturally be specially increased. Because their responsibilities are heavy, I especially hope that you will work doubly hard. This will enable Shanghai's financial system to be completely renewed. However, if, after the special increase in compensation, you still have other illegal actions or illegal things happening, then there is no need to consider anything else. You will be severely punished by law. I am declaring in advance that I will not tolerate or forgive such illegal people. This is not to intentionally make alarmist statements. To rectify discipline and establish a clean and honest atmosphere, it must be done this way. At the same time, I hope that you will convey my words to the lower-level staff and encourage each other."</p>

<h3>Enemy American Attempt to Land in China Factually Impossible Saltada Captain Denounces Rumor Mongers</h3>
<p>Following usual practice, the Naval Fleet Press Department of the Japanese Government held a meeting with newspaper reporters from this city yesterday (the 26th) at 2:00 PM. Minister Matsushima had not returned to Shanghai due to official business in Japan. Captain Saltada continued to represent the Department and critically analyzed the recent rumors spreading in the city that enemy American forces were planning to bomb Taiwan, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and even Jinshanwei in order to first conduct a landing. Captain Saltada pointed out that those rumors were groundless and did not deserve the attention of informed people. The main points of the conversation were as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy Americans Unable to Land in China</p>
<p>It would be surprising that the enemy is using China as a place to start a landing but there is no possibility in fact. If they wanted to make this attempt, they would have to break up the Japanese supplement line first, and then start the bombing of Philippines, but it is not easy. If the enemy wants to land, where are the troops? New Guinea and the Philippines can’t be drawn out, so they want to make an attempt elsewhere but its constrained. Southern China and Hainan are important bases for Japanese troops. The air defense installations are very solid, even if the enemy comes, it will be difficult to succeed. Especially in Taiwan, if the enemy does not get their hands on it, then the war will not continue.</p>
<p>Starting Rumors Worth a Smile</p>
<p>Speculate on the one who started rumors. The one who started the rumor, its purpose is to profit and to disrupt the peace. There is no factual basis that the rumors were started from, and the rumors is not worth of a smile. The rumor of the US military coming up from Hangzhou bay happened during the second bombing of Taiwan and those who created the rumor are heard of the bombing of Taiwan, the latter is made to attach with the former. There are those that say the landing point is not one, and there are a lot of aspects to the rumor, and another say the US military is landing at Lianyungang. There are a lot of rumors. US military landing must see how the war in Philippines goes, otherwise it is very dangerous. Japanese prepared in southern China for strong and force defense.</p>
<p>Details of Attack on Shanghai Warplanes</p>
<p>Captain Tian Dawei also made a statement on the results of the recent battle between the US aircraft attacking Shanghai and the Japanese Air Force: On the 17th, more than a dozen enemy planes attacked Shanghai, and the Japanese shot down seven planes and destroyed five. Two Chinese civilians were killed or injured. This time, the Japanese Air Force's counterattack achieved excellent results, which was unprecedented. The air defense training of citizens has also greatly improved. There is no longer the previous situation where many people were killed or injured due to arbitrary observation. This is fortunate. The enemy planes that attacked Shanghai this time were in formations of two or three, and they used machine guns to strafe downwards in the air. Fortunately, no civilians were killed. The work of searching for the crash sites of the enemy planes and their wreckage is still underway. One fuselage was found on the ground in the southwest of Guipu, lightly burned, and the pilot was killed. One plane was also found in the Wu County area. Residents of the Nanshi area witnessed three American planes crashing in the far south, but the location of the crash is unknown. Enemy planes were also shot down southwest of Hongqiao, but the wreckage has not yet been found. Every time enemy planes come to attack, Japanese planes will take off to intercept them. Citizens sometimes mistakenly think that they are American planes. The Japanese planes have red markings on both wings, which can be distinguished. At present, the air defense in Shanghai has further improved. If American planes come to attack again in the future, they will suffer great losses.</p>

Zhongbei played with an ideal lineup last night, consisting of Chen Xuechong, Shen Yucong, Li Zhenzhong, Zhuo Guorong, and Bao Songyuan, completely resembling the Chinese national team, stable and confident.

<h3>Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association's Appeal for Donations for Winter Relief</h3>
<p>This Association, aware that there are many extremely poor and hidden poor among the citizens of Shanghai, especially in these times, there is a necessity for relief, and after consultation, has decided to raise 50 million yuan to purchase grains and handle price stabilization. Subsequently, the Municipal Government established the Winter Relief Committee, and most of the members of this Association participated in the work of the Winter Relief Committee. For example, Chen Riping, a director of this Association, is the Deputy Director of the Winter Relief Committee. After further consultation, in order to save on administrative expenses, it was entrusted to the Winter Relief Committee. In order to handle it quickly, we first consulted with the Central Reserve Bank authorities to assist in borrowing the entire 50 million yuan, which was then handed over to the Winter Relief Committee for distribution. The Winter Relief Committee has first organized three temporary relief projects. However, the loan is agreed to be repaid in three installments, with the first installment due on February 10th, which is fast approaching. The Board of Directors of this Association has decided to entrust the Xin Shen two newspapers to publicly raise funds. We respectfully hope that the wealthy and charitable people at sea will generously donate to benefit the poor people. If you wish to donate, please send it directly to the Social Service Department of the Xin Shen two newspapers for collection. The titles of the donors will be published in the Xin Shen two newspapers in succession.</p>

<h3>Peach and Plum Trees All Over the Land</h3>
<p>Hoping Enthusiastic People Will Do Their Utmost to Provide Relief</p>
<p>The ancients used the term "peach and plum" to describe worthy individuals. Later generations praised educators with numerous students, also saying "peach and plum fill the gate." The "Han Shi Waizhuan" mainly says, "In spring, plant peach and plum trees, and in summer you can enjoy their shade beneath, and in autumn, eat their fruits. In spring, plant tribulus, and in summer you cannot gather its leaves, and in autumn you get its thorns." This means that "peach and plum" give great benefits to people's lives. In summer, peach and plum trees grow luxuriantly, and people can enjoy the coolness under the trees. In autumn, the fruits are abundant, providing people with food. Not only that, but the peach and plum blossoms in spring are also very beautiful, providing enjoyment. As for "tribulus," it also grows in spring, but its branches and leaves have thorns and cannot be used, simply a harmful thing. Speaking of the five thousand impoverished students sponsored by this newspaper, all are in the top third of their classes and recommended by the principals. Of course, they are the most outstanding "peach and plum," not "tribulus." They are currently studying in elementary school, junior and senior high school, vocational school, and even university, scattered in schools throughout Shanghai. In another ten or twenty years, they will certainly be scattered throughout the country, working hard to revitalize and build the nation, so it is said, "peach and plum trees all over the land." Unfortunately, they are currently trapped by their family circumstances and unable to attend school. We hope that wealthy and powerful, enthusiastic people will generously donate and fulfill their responsibility to provide relief and assistance.</p>

<h3>Strengthening the Security of the City's Suburbs</h3>
<p>— Dezhi</p>
<p>In the past, all facilities of the Shanghai authorities were focused on the urban area, while the counties and suburbs belonging to this city have not been properly constructed since the war, and even the most fundamental security issues have not been fully established. I believe that the counties and suburbs are equally important, so I hope the authorities will rectify them.</p>
<p>First: Shanghai's population has long exceeded the saturation point, and it should be dispersed as soon as possible. The suburbs are relatively convenient and easy to disperse to.</p>
<p>Second: Future air battles are bound to be fierce, and some industries and the elderly and weak in Shanghai are best evacuated to the suburbs.</p>
<p>Third: The soaring prices and scarcity of goods have reached the most serious stage. Prices in the suburbs are lower, and life is easier. Impoverished people should go there as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fourth: Recently, various music groups have laid off a large number of employees, and the number of unemployed will increase even more. The suburban agricultural production has always been abundant, and the labor of the unemployed can be used to increase production.</p>
<p>The above four points are sufficient to prove the importance of the suburbs, but because security cannot be established, we earnestly hope that the municipal authorities will strengthen the security of the suburbs to promote the evacuation work.</p>
<p>First: Reorganize the Baojia system. The Baojia organization in the suburbs is mostly nominal, the household registration is inaccurate, and the heads of the districts, townships, towns, Bao, and Jia are particularly ineffective. Therefore, the candidates for Baojia chiefs should be strictly selected and then trained, implement a general household registration review, and conduct random checks at any time.</p>
<p>Second: Enhance the strength of the police force. The treatment of police and security teams in the suburbs is extremely low, and the police force is inevitably scattered. Therefore, police expenses must be planned, salaries increased, and unqualified personnel eliminated, and new cadres trained to replenish the police force and enrich equipment.</p>
<p>Third: Universally set up self-defense. Each township should train young men to universally form self-defense groups and patrol teams to help each other and make up for the shortage of police force.</p>
<p>Fourth: Eliminate drugs and gambling. The prevalence of gambling in the suburbs is rampant, which harms the people and wastes wealth. There is nothing more serious than this, and it has a major impact on security. It should be eradicated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fifth: Eliminate the violent and protect the good. There is no shortage of local tyrants and evil gentry in the townships who rely on special forces to extort and fleece the people. These bad elements must be cracked down on. If there is collusion between the military and police to do evil, they must be brought to justice, so that the good people can live and work in peace and contentment.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Advanced Training Association Adds a Welfare Group</h3>
<p>The elementary school teachers' winter vacation advanced training association has been open for three days since the lectures began, and the male and female teachers who go to listen to the lectures every day are very enthusiastic. Recently, in order to meet general needs, a welfare group has been added, which is divided into health checkups, job referrals, etc. The job referral section is particularly busy, and dozens of people have registered one after another, and more than a dozen schools have entrusted them to find talent. If schools still want to hire teachers, they can directly send a letter to this office or the Shanghai Transfer Elementary School Advanced Training Association on Xindagu Road. Also, on the afternoon of the 24th, in order to review elementary school life, experts were specially invited to hold a symposium on elementary school life issues, and it is planned to request the government to give priority to allocating various daily necessities, in order to obtain a minimum level of living guarantee, so that everyone can work with peace of mind, and achieve the goal of improving educational efficiency and benefiting the nation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Native Association Student Aid Fund Registration Will Close</h3>
<p>The student aid fund for impoverished Zhenjiang native children, sponsored by the Zhenjiang Shanghai Native Association in this city, has always been limited to those studying below the high school level. There have been university students with excellent grades and impoverished families who have come to the association to request special subsidies, but it is impossible to accept them due to the regulations. It is now known that Mr. Tang Shoumin founded the China Business Vocational School, located in the Jiaotong Bank building on Jing'an Temple Road. The tuition fee is only 10,000 yuan, which is much cheaper than other universities. If Zhenjiang native children are studying in business high schools and other schools and cannot afford to attend, they can ask the association to request Mr. Tang Shoumin to recommend them for free or reduced fees to provide assistance. It is also heard that the registration of old students held by the association has been decided to close on the 28th of this month and will not be extended. All Zhenjiang native children in Shanghai who plan to continue their studies in the next semester can immediately bring their supporting documents and quickly apply to the association at No. 3 Zhifu Road, Zhejiang Road intersection, second floor.</p>
<h3>Student Aid and Small Loans</h3>
<p>The student aid and small capital loans organized by Anhua Bank began to be applied for on the 21st. On that morning, no less than two hundred young students waited at the door. The person in charge of the bank successively interviewed them, and the order was in good order. Those who passed the interview were given an application form by the bank, and they were required to fill it out and submit it within two days for review. It is heard that the amount of student aid organized by the bank this time includes all tuition and miscellaneous fees. Once approved, the bank will directly pay the school on behalf of the students, which is a great benefit to impoverished students. The number of applicants for small capital loans is relatively small, probably because not many people currently know that the bank is organizing small capital loans. The bank is still continuing to accept applications for the above-mentioned small capital loans, while applications for student aid will close at 20:00 on Saturday.</p>
<p>Address: 54 Shanxi Road.</p>
<p>The Shanghai South City Citizens Welfare Association, in order to meet the actual needs of the common people, has specially organized small capital loans to provide livelihood opportunities for impoverished people. It is heard that the application procedures for this loan will start immediately, divided into two types: 2,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan, which can be divided into ten installments to repay the principal without any fees or interest. Impoverished people in Nanshi who have a legitimate need for loans and have reliable shop guarantees can apply to the association at No. 99 Jinjiafang, Nanshi.</p>
<h3>Alumni Advanced Training Association Launches a Variety Show</h3>
<p>The University Alumni Advanced Training Association is an academic welfare organization automatically organized by university students in Shanghai. Recently, in response to this newspaper's student aid and poverty relief, it launched a variety show, inviting the ticket office of the First Special District Office and the Yisheng Opera Troupe to perform Peking Opera and modern drama, as well as movie stars Bai Guang, Fei Qiuxia, Bai Hong, etc. to sing. It is scheduled to be performed gratuitously at the Jincheng Grand Theater on February 24th, and the Shanghai Radio Station will broadcast it to the city at that time.</p>
<h3>Teacher Training Class</h3>
<p>The Education College of Huadong University, in view of the low level of teachers and the decline in teaching efficiency, in order to facilitate general educators or in-service teachers who are interested in education to have the opportunity to improve, has expanded its scope and established a teacher training class, inviting famous professors to give lectures, and universally providing free academic places. Detailed information can be obtained from the school at No. 302 Baike Road (intersection of Huanghe Road).</p>
<h3>New Star Medicine Aid Movement</h3>
<p>This time, the New Star Pharmaceutical Factory promoted the medicine aid movement and donated ten kinds of medicines. The first batch of medicines has been distributed to sixteen designated hospitals: Red Cross First Hospital, Red Cross Third Hospital, Guangci Hospital, Chongren Hospital, Tongren Second Hospital, Shanghai Hospital, Shanghai Local Hospital, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Siming Hospital, Jimin Hospital, Shanghai Factory Joint Hospital, Nanshi Relief Hospital, New Pharmaceutical Industry Association First Hospital, New Pharmaceutical Industry Association Second Hospital, Shanghai Health Experimental Area, and Xinzao Health Experimental Area. All of the following are eligible to apply to designated hospitals for free supply: (1) Salaried employees in the industrial and commercial sectors, (2) Scientific and technical personnel in academic institutions, (3) Teachers in office, (4) Loan and aid students of Xin Shen two newspapers, (5) Direct family members of the above four items.</p>
<h3>Cough Relief Elixir Continues Charity Sale</h3>
<p>Mr. Sun Bonan, who studied medicine at St. John's University in his early years and is now teaching at a certain university, always suffers from coughs every winter, which repeatedly heal and relapse. He has extensively collected the advantages of Western medicine and created a "Cough Relief Elixir" Cucilin, which is made purely with American raw materials and is specially used to treat various coughs, such as bronchitis, phlegm asthma, and whooping cough in children, with miraculous effects. It was first sold in the education sector and was highly praised by teachers and students. Recently, it has been noted that the number of people suffering from this disease is increasing day by day, but because the price of medicine is expensive, they are unable to purchase it and delay treatment, suffering deeply. Therefore, two dozen bottles are donated for charity sale, which have already been sold out. Now, three dozen more bottles are sent for continued charity sale. The selling price is 350 yuan per bottle. After recovering the cost of 250 yuan, the remaining 100 yuan will be donated to this office's medical aid fund to save the poor and sick.</p>
<h3>Nursing Home Appeals for Donations of Old Horse-Drawn Carriages</h3>
<p>The nuns of the nursing home go out to beg for alms every day, regardless of wind and rain. Every morning, a tired horse can be seen pulling a worn-out carriage, rattling through the vegetable market streets. Whatever they get, they load it on the teacher. This is the old horse-drawn carriage placed in the nursing home. Because of the lack of funds, the nuns run around, and the need for the car is even more frequent. If there is a time for distribution, it must also be used to carry goods. Therefore, only one vehicle is not enough. A certain German expatriate knew this and generously donated a good horse. However, having a horse without a car is still useless. Therefore, we appeal to benevolent gentlemen to donate old horse-drawn carriages, regardless of style, all are welcome, so that both beauty and practicality can be achieved, complementing each other. If you are willing to donate, please indicate the address of the hospital at No. 39 Jichang Street, and this office can also contact you.</p>
