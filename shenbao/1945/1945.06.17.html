<h3>冲繩島戰鬥凄烈展開　日堅守小祿陣地　航空部隊連續猛襲敵艦船</h3>
<p>某航空基地十六日中央社電　冲繩戰綫近因時屆霉雨季節，趨方空戰暫告停頓，陸上戰鬥則凄烈展開，並未因天氣惡劣及陣地泥濘而稍呈停頓狀態。十三日北·中兩機塲之敵小型機約三百二十架，終日對島尻南部地區日軍陣地施以超低空轟炸，同時，系滿海面及　川海面附近，有敵戰艦兩艘，巡洋艦，驅逐艦各數艘侵人海岸綫，對日軍主要陣地施以熾烈艦炮射擊。又冲繩本島日軍地上部隊雖不斷受優勢敵軍熾烈砲火壓制，然仍於那　西南方小祿方面敢行誓死迎擊，現正堅守小祿地區</p>
<p>日軍某航空基地十六日巾央社電　冲繩日軍因戰略都係，由係滿南方之國吉附近及凑川西方具志頭附近開始整理戰綫，並封敵軍之猛攻奮勇應戰，若敵戰艦一艘之艦砲射擊彈量與小型機一千五百架轟炸　相等，則該方面之日軍將士，至少受小型機三千五百架以上之森炸，其苦戰情形，實非筆墨所能形容。</p>
<p>南西羣島基地十六日中央社電　日航空部隊曾於十四·十五兩日夜間及十六日未亮時，對羣集於冲繩木島周圍爲協力陸上作戰之敵艦船，加以數度猛擊，同時，與此相呼應之日軍別動部隊，對敵陸上航空基地，予以反復猛襲，使其數處爆炸起火。又敵自增强其陸上空軍基地之兵力後，十四日畫問，曾有敵機約四百架來襲列島沿綫。</p>
<h3>沖繩漸入霉雨期　日特攻機隊活躍　敵機動部隊作分散侵擾</h3>
<p>前綫基地十六日中央社電　冲繩本島南部地區之日軍部隊，終將主力集結於南部島　之狹隘地帶，沖繩之地上戰況，益加深刻，蓋隨地上戰鬥之南下，而向南部移動之敵艦艇羣，十一日於嘉手納·系滿·　川·中城灣·那霸等近海，共有數羣，每羣兵力約有戰艦一艦。巡洋艦一艘至二艘，驅逐艦二艘至三艘，由日軍地上部隊後方續行熾烈之艦炮射擊，日特工攻對此等艦艇羣至攻擊，六月以來，益加猛烈。六日以後之奇襲，殆皆成功，特攻機之無綫電聯絡所示，六日及十一日，其撞中率達十分之七至十分之九，建立極大戰果。冲繩本島邇來逐漸邁入允雨期，視程達十公里許，此適特攻隊破敵艦羣之機會。蓋　於密雲之中，可以逃避敵機迎擊，突如衝入敵艦上空之特攻戰法，於茲四五日以來，頗使敵方狼狽。又日特攻隊之衝撞，自　烈容艇隊强行降陸後，益加頻　，使敵哨哨　機於極度疲乏，　其狼　之時，九　曾發動四架拼　敵艦二艘，是日出動之第一架，將敵巡洋艦腹部撞破，第二架繼之衝入穴內，此乃日軍獨有之戰法也。</p>
<p>九州南大東島脫拉克遭炮襲</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　沖繩本島南部島　地區構　陣勇戰之日軍，自本月六日以來，對於侵佔具志頭。富盛。世名城。系滿北例之優勢政軍來攻，繼　奮勇作戰，敵人主要攻擊，似在東海岸之具志函·富盛正面。敵軍派第七師團。第九十六師團·海兵第一師團共三師之衆，自東海岸同時進政，小隊地區之日軍，雖於　勢之敵軍包圍下，仍　勇迎擊，使敵出血甚多，現設方面之敵機動部隊，因登陸當時之援助登陸作戰，海而巡擬等工作已告完畢，且因陸上基地已構成十餘處，故該隊今後之　命，已轉換為空軍基地之獲　。該機動部隊，近以少數艦船，遊弋於九州方而南大東島附近，一再以艦細機進攻九州南大東島，至十日夜，並以少數機動部隊自兵艦射擊南大東島。十四·十五兩日，脫拉克方面有少數敵機動部隊出現，各以累計達一百架之飛機來次，十五日更作艦炮射擊。十四日有敵　　不明之一艘接近某島近海。砲擊陸岸，此種戰法。當爲　盟日特攻戰法之威力，故分散軍力，向各地侵擾。</p>
<h3>相撲灣等處　被投擲機雷</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　十六日午前一時三十五分，敵B29型機十餘架，以其主力於相撲　投下機雷，以一部北進，於當山灣投下同樣機雷後，向南方遁去。又是日午前零時五十分，逐次候入之B29型機十餘架，於周防難山口西部，關門地區投下機雷。又另外之B29型機五榮，於是日一時，由體摩半島西方海面逐次單機侵入，行動於　島五島附近搏多　附近，投下機雷。</p>
<h3>敵機及艦跑　襲特魯克島</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地十六日中央社電　十四日敵曾以六十架，十五日復以二十架之艦載機來要特魯克島方面之日軍基地，當時，曾被日軍擊落，擊毀數架。又十五日晨，敵巡洋艦，驅逐艦數艘，駛進該島，並甲乙　炮射擊，該地日軍部隊與之交戰，將之擊退。</p>
<p>美英調動海空軍準備次期作戰</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　沖繩戰綫之敵軍，從日海兵特攻隊及陸上部隊之繼續猛攻，雖已蒙極大犧牲？然仍反復展開攻擊，預期制應該海海域日軍，同時　似已迅速進行次期侵攻作戰準備，冲繩海　敵斯　　盎斯麾下第五艦隊與哈的賽　下第三艦隊之調訪，駐電英本土杜爾德　下第六航空部隊之轉調東亞，麥克沃塞，斯蒂維爾之馬尼　會　，以及米亞擊下之航空部隊之脫離東南亞　亞軍司令部，皆　充分國土敵陣營張抑或逐次侵攻，更或擴展大陸沿岸作戰，雖不容吾人迅加無端，然無論敵軍採取何種攻勢，今後對日實行航空總攻擊，其規定之大，及其襲擊之頻，富屬空前強烈，此乃必然事實。吾人已充分預測敵軍必將於沖繩海域建設更多設立基地羣，以期呼應馬里亞納基地空軍之襲日本炸，且敵軍於起見，當以其空母航空部隊亦出動轟炸，同時，吾人尚須注意大陸敵軍動向。能接情報稱，米亞麾下之東亞美空軍司令部及曾於印度有其基地之美第二十轟炸隊，已同時移向馬里亞納，吾人可由是得知，敵將向大陸方面展開空戰，頗堪注目，如次，敵以空木航空隊，對天平已及大陸之航空隊增強陣容，預期對日本本土舉行一大航空攻擊，刻正進行準備·美大總統特魯曼曾稱，今後對日作戰，將使用空軍矣力三百五十萬名，杜爾德亦云，「對日作戰，首由空襲弱化日本，以使我軍陸上部隊能於本島登陸」。故敵欲對本土登陸，勢必以大量空軍企圖剿減。本之決戰能力，而其所以如此愼重準備新作戰者，實因　敵軍由於冲繩作戰經騐，已深知對日本土侵攻愈近，則其困難愈加，損害愈慘重。　根據已往之離島作戰經騐，美軍對登陸部隊連續加强補給增援，但對方日軍毫無補助，然美軍尚蒙莫大損害，如展開日本本土登陸作戰時，日本可舉一切戰力，而傾注於戰塲。反之，美軍補給增援，較前更加困難，故美軍作戰有極大失敗之可能性。　敵方已爲日軍特攻隊之微粒所震驚，故敵首腦部乃決意首先傾注全力，以攻擊日軍特攻隊，不然，決不能獲得日本土登陸作戰勝利，由於此種見解，故彼等企圖已焦土轟炸戰術，將日特攻基地，生產設施與交通機關完全破話，以炮擊及轟炸消滅日本國民戰意，然無論地方如何轟炸，亦僅為登陸作戰之準備工作，決定左後之勝利者，乃陸上部隊主力之決戰。日本一億國民，全體皆有以特工精神，前仆後繼，誓死防衛租給決意，因此，敵軍若於日本土敢行登陸，必遭日方劇烈反擊而剿滅。</p>
<h3>論江蘇省食糧增產問題</h3>
<p>— 陳耀溪</p>
<p>就墾荒論江蘇省食糧增產題題</p>
<p>上述之改善栽培技術，係就增加單位面積之生產量而言，茲更就擴展耕地面積論之。</p>
<p>所謂擴展耕地面積，並非專對某一作物擴展其耕作面積，而係就全體晨業擴展其耕作而積而言。戰後閃政府統制之不均衡，戰時需求之變動。及農村金融之乾涸，江南農村各作物之栽培面積變動極大。如三十一年棉花實施統制與乎當時食對需求量之增高及生產成本較低，農民多以棉田改植雜糧。結果雜糧固增產，而棉花則爲減產。惟用懇荒法以擴展耕地面積，則其增產爲絕對者，其價値絕大也</p>
<p>我國皇帝幾多，內政部統計司於十八至十九年二月，根據二十一省五百六十七縣之呈報數，全國荒地面積計一·一七七·三四〇·二六一畝·其中江蘇省呈報三十五縣，有荒地百餘萬畝，共未經呈報及求參加各縣之荒地，當至少在五十萬　之上。</p>
<p>事變後農村受戰事影響及　　滋擾，一部份優良田地陷入不能　作之狀態，荒地面　之有增無減無　諱言，故欲擴展耕地面積，則確保治安當屬要圖。　新墾荒地單位面積之生產量，每因地力瘠薄而不及耕地致富；而墾荒耽誤面積所需至費用，復較耕地爲大。農民於利益之權衡下，皆感無力可圖，雖政府訂定獎勵墾荒辦法，每畝酌予補助懇殖費三百元，然物價日夜飛躍，杯水車薪終非善策也。</p>
<p>要之。政府當積極謀治安之確保，再加以寛裕之金錢補助，則農民之利益旣得保彈，經濟復得援助，必能踴躍從事，江蘇省之懇荒事業·不　加以推動。就江南各縣而言，至少可增加現有耕地面積百分之二十也。</p>
<p>災害防除論江蘇省食糧增產問題</p>
<p>作物之災書可分兩種，　氣象災　－水旱風。　保虫災害－　　各各種病患。</p>
<p>吾國因水利設建之幼稚，地理環境之複雜，局部災害年有發生，如黃河流域一帶之通年水災·西北高原一帶之運年旱災是。即以江蘇省而論，太湖流域低田多於高田，如吳江·常熟·武進·江陰·金壇之東南部，靑浦·松江。宜興。太倉·崑山·無錫之東北部，吳縣·　陽之東北部均爲低窪之田，一遇淫雨之年，其產　即大受影響，此於高田汗岸之興築，及河道之開濬以資保障，實爲必要者。</p>
<p>至於病虫害之情形更屬嚴重，如　害最烈之三十年秋，江蘇之無錫，江陰一帶，竟有無稻可收，而僅携竹筐至田間揀取較實之稻穗者，一畝所獲不足供全家一飽，共較佳者損失亦達半數以上。以江陰一地而論，該縣有稻田八十萬畝，每畝受　害損失之自米至少一石以上，若以當時米價約値百元一石計，則損失金額常達八千萬元以上。又三十二年武進一帶受螟災最嚴重之田，被害株竟在百分之七十以上。</p>
<p>故從災害之防除上言之，除對水利工程普遍興條外，對螟害之防除亦須積極推行。如勵行冬耕，燒　稻根，收買螟蛾螟卵，採用合式秧田等，則食糧增產方能得以保障，而以往之損失不難立挽也。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>綜上所論，江蘇省食糧增產問題</p>
<p>品種改良及推廣優種之觀點。</p>
<p>栽培技術改善之觀點。</p>
<p>懇荒之觀點。</p>
<p>災害防除之觀點。</p>
<p>皆有重大關係。現在江南二十一縣年產米二千七百九十萬石，如能照上述各點多方努力，則增加產量之半，即一千萬石，多供五百萬人之食糧，當可斷言也。（完）</p>

<h3>平定糧價對策</h3>
<p>— 陳頴川</p>
<p>近幾年來，糧價的急劇上漲，每年總有好幾次，而每次上漲，却引起其他物價同時上漲。糧價領導物價的理論，乃在糧價可以影饗工資，而工資復司影響生產成本；蓋物價的高低，常視其生產過程中所耗成本的多寡而轉移，就價値理論言，一切成本都可還原爲勞力或工資，而此二者又被決定於直接從事生產勞力者的最低限度生活必需品價格的高低。所謂生活必需品，糧食實居首位，所以糧價是決定物價的根源，乃是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>糧價與物價的關係，依照上述理諭的基礎，以及過去事實來觀，確有其密切的相關，糧價高，則物價高，糧價低，則物價低；不過物價變動的原因很多，糧價僅是許多重要原因中的一個。我們固然不能把物價變動的關係，完全歸責於糧價；但是也不能忽視糧價的影響，尤其是最近糧價的暴漲，很顯着的促進其他一般物價同時暴漲。</p>
<p>現在舉例來說，以上海幾種生活必需品如白粳。黃豆。樹柴。布匹的市價比較，假定均以木年一月平均價作基　，爲一〇〇，則五月份白粳市價指數爲三九八·八，六月十三日指數爲一七六八·八；五月份　豆市價指數爲三二二·四，六月十三日　　爲一八五六·九；五月份樹柴市價指數爲一四七·五·六月十三日指數爲六三一·五；五月份布匹（龍頭細布）市價指數爲三六四·七，六月十三日指數爲七九一·八。從這指數者來，可見米價漲後，其他物價亦都漲。其中黃豆市價，也可說是雜糧價格，其上漲率最近已經超過米糧價格。</p>
<p>這一次米價暴漲，固有其錯綜複雜的原因；但產地存底不豐，靑黃不接，運輸困難，以及人爲的投機操縱等，要爲其主要因素。由於目前米儂如此高昂，已非一般人民講買力听及，於是頗有以曾糧替代的傾向。因之，投機家的目光，都移轉到雜糧方面，促使雜糧市價　漲不已，其漲率反而超過米　。在米糧問　　重的今日，今後市民食糧勢將由雜撇來替代；然而雜糧價昂非凡，一般人民已有不勝負担之苦。照理，雜糧現狀不比米糧，雜糧決無如此暴漲之理。所以有此現象者，無非人爲的　斷操縱，這實在是不容忽視的。</p>
<p>糧　　　，促進了其他一　物價的高漲。這從事實上　　，或從理論上推考，證明了糧價的確定物　　動的中心勢力，甚至可說，今後物價的　落，將以糧儂的高低來決定。所以，平　糧價，必然的要從糧價本身着手，就是平　其他物價，也得先把糧價平抑。其次，糧食是生活必需品，又佔着最低生活費中很大的比率。一廢物價固要平抑；但尤須平抑糧價。因此不能不　求糧價早日平定，以安民生。</p>
<p>至於如何平定糧價呢？講起平定，其道多端；不過針對過去　結，必須對症下　。我們覺得如下幾端，必先實行：</p>
<p>第一，必使農民樂於生產。近年農村對於都市的貢獻不可謂不大；可是農民所得實惠試問可有多少。要使其樂於生產，就必須使之得有實惠。其先決條件，必光解除障阻生產的極　，　如：　雜的剷除，治安的確立，收買的合理化，而尤以收買一點爲最重要。現在中樞當局鑒於最近各地米價暴漲，決定施行緊急措置：一·米糧統制委員會及其他一切團體之採辦工作，暫時停止，二·現行米糧移動限制，即行撤銷。縱第一點可以看出今後收買方法勢將革新，或者可由商人等自由參加收買，而受當局監督。這裏，有一些微末之見，過去每當收買農產品，現鈔必大量流向農村，從事實上看來，農民對此並不感到興趣。本來，農民出售其剩餘的農產品，是爲購買其生活上及生產上所需的物資。如果能以農村所需要的實物來交換都市所需要的糧食，各供所餘，各取所需，農民必甚歡迎。如果能迎合農民重視黃金的傳統觀念，以現鈔收買農產品時，搭付一部分黃金，農民一定樂於提供其產品。</p>
<p>第二，制裁雜糧投機興採購雜糧運滬。現在靑黃不接時期，農村米糧存底未必豐厚，勢不敷供應非產米區的大量需要。我們必須認淸此點，在現狀下，只有搭食雜糧，甚至改用雜糧。不過目前雜糧價格至爲昂貴，非一般市民購買力所能負擔。如此高價，好說是人爲的壟斷操縱一手所造成，爲乎抑目前雜糧價格計，必先檢舉雜糧投機操縱者，予以最體厲的制裁。同時，深望當局有計劃的向淮海各地以及崇明等處採運雜糧來滬。不久前，項康原氏曾建議集體購邇報糧，確是一個很好的辦法，希望當局協助，力促其成。</p>
<p>第三，縱續舉辦麵粉雜糧戶口配給。木市向有麵粉雜糧的戶口配給，不過時斷時續，日其量有限，不敷每人所需。但是每一次配給開始以後，對於緩和糧價，多少有其作用。今後在各方協助之下，小麥與雜糧的供應，相信必能圓滑與充裕。如何一次小麥與雜糧作為民需配給，幷求其合理，實爲當前應該研討的課題價，安定民生。過去滬市配給制度，實施以來，其成績雖不能說沒有；但亦不能儘如人意。譬如說，配給的不按期，又不足量；虛報冒領者有之，一人領數份者有之；零售商的剋扣分量，或以劣質同樣物資配給；富有者已多物品存儲，照樣亦享受配給。凡此種種，均非合理配給所應有的現象。故今後配給，必須貴乎合理與澈底。</p>
<p>第四，限制糧食存儲數量。在米糧移動限制開放以後，限制糧食存儲數量，更有強調的必要；因為存糧如不限制，則有錢者可以自由競購，給予「商人」以抬價機會，結果　害大衆，過去市府對於食米儲量，曾明令不得超過三個月之需要。如今爲防止食糧囤積，應重申前令，並燕歌執行。</p>
<p>以上四端，不過原則而已。如果常同認爲可以採擇，請另加硏究，擬訂實施辦法，付諸實行，最後還要附帶說幾句，一切事情，如果要負責任的達到效果，部是有困難的；但是在實際負責的工作者看來，無論什麼困難，部是可以克服的。天下無不可爲之時，無不可爲之事，惟視其決心而已。</p>

<h3>變更評價程序辦法　改採協定價格　物價會羅兼主委發表聲明</h3>
<p>本市物價評議委員會，自經市府令派羅秘書長君强兼任主任委員後，昨日羅氏召集舉行該會第十七次會議，各委員僉以該會過去評價程序太繁，所評價格，每失時效，均主酌予變更，以應需要，爰經一致決議「凡以前列入公定價格範圍內各種重要商品價格之評定，改採取協定價格之精神，由同業公會擬定送會審核決定，但爲緊急處置之必要，得先由主任委員核定公佈施行，再提會追認」。今後本市物價之管理，益臻强化，對於商民正當之利潤得以適宜顧及，因評價而感覺手績過繁之困雜，亦可免除。關於此案，羅氏特發聲明如次：</p>
<p>羅氏聲明</p>
<p>「查重要商品限價，依照中央規定，應由物價評議會，根據同業公會之申請，參酌實際成本開會評定，俾求合理。邇來一般物價，日趨高翔，重要商品價格，隨之而增，致有越出限價情事，　諸法理，固有未合，按諸事實，不無可原，良以評價會之評定限價，先需調查，繼續審核。再交評議會研討，然後提由委員會公定，手絞上之過程　多，所需之時日亦久，致評定之限價，每感失卻時效，在執行與取締上，頗覺困難，不取締於法不合，取締於情不忍，此非評價會組織本身上有所缺陷，實因其職權之使用方法，與現實之環境不盡適合所致。本會有鑒於次，爰經第十七次會議議決，嗣後凡一千列入公定價格範圍內各種重要商品價格之評定，改採用協定價格之精神，由同業公會擬訂，送會審核決定。但爲緊急處置之必要，得先由主任委員核定公佈施行，再提評價委員會迫認，俾生置不致因限價過低而受影響，取締上亦可有精確之準備。帷是本會此舉對於評價會固有之職權，並無絲毫減損，特賦與同業公會以更大之責任而已，務望各該同業公會，對於合理價格之擬定，必須詳切調查，審慎商討，並附確實成立證件，凡本會認為合理者，無不迅予核准公佈·尤須注重於執行，故取締上得愈形強化，將過去議而不行之弊，完全革除，如何利用職權，故意提高，以圖朦混漁利者，公會全體負責人，應負連帶責任，當依法嚴厲懲處，決不寬貸。限價一經核定公佈，商民均得遵守，不得　有超越情事，除由警察局經濟保安警察嚴加取締外，今特聲明如上。」</p>
<h3>八種雜糧　今起平價出售　每人限購五市斤</h3>
<p>邇來米價飛漲，即雜糧價格亦隨之上騰不已，本市民食前途，已達嚴重階段，有識之士，　焉憂之。市政當局刻正盡力設法採購雜糧，疏通運輸，以圖　定民食。頃聞本市雜糧業同業公會負責人，及所屬會員，誠恐糧儂繼長增高，影響民生治安，爰指定赤豆等八種，可以替代食米之雜糧，幷擬具平準價格，呈請經濟局核示辦理。談局以該商等深明大義，殊堪嘉許，業予核准，試行舉辦，幷暫定自本月十七日起施行，市民得憑居住證每人購買五市斤，以十五天爲期。至品目表內儂格，應以三日爲一期，如有特殊情形，得隨時加以調整，已令飭該業公會轉知所屬會員一體遵照，平儂普遍發售，以濟民食。事關全市民衆生計。亟盼其他日用品業急起直追，繼續雜糧業而自動辦理平價。</p>
<h3>本市米價　止漲回跌</h3>
<p>國府爲抑平米價疏通來源，施行緊急措置，決定停止各統制機關採辦工作，撤銷米糧移動限制，同時盟邦當局，亦決定協力國府措置，停止收買軍米，本市各界聞訊之餘，莫不擁護政府賢明措置。昨日米儂，立即止漲回跌，最短期內，民生復蘇有望。茲悉有關需局爲防止米商利用准許自由採運機會，囤積居奇，已派員澈査不法商人暗中收囤，一面由中央儲備銀行嚴密檢査金融繼關，不許放款私自收囤米糧</p>
<h3>狹幅被單窗帘布　准免予收買</h3>
<p>商統會棉業統制委員會自改組後，即按照組織規程規定，接收商統會收買紗布臨時管理委員會，設科辦理前收買紗布未了事宜。茲悉該會近據各紗布廠商請求，免予收買狹幅被單及窗帘布悄事，經轉呈行政院核示，業巳核准免予收買。該會已開始辦理是項申請手續，並爲體念商艱起見，對於紗布商申請手續，決予便利迅連，接到申請隨到隨　，希紗布商勿受中問人牟利愚弄。</p>
<h3>警局舉行　司法會議</h3>
<p>市警察局第三處，爲强化司法業務，推行防犯運動，特於昨（十六）日假警局七樓，召開第四次司法連絡會議，由第三處長李時雨，副處長　賢二郎主持，並到特別法庭上海分庭，高等檢察署，高等法院，地方法院，地方檢察署，上海監獄，保安司令部，遊民勞働營等司法機關長官，　該處各科長各分局第三股主任等，由上海高等檢察署胡檢察長主席，席間討論刑事犯　押交保，及防止撥款單失竊或遺失等流弊，以及有關司法各項問題，均有詳細硏究，至五時餘始行散會。</p>
<h3>撥款單貼現　中儲嚴予取締　明起檢查各金融機關</h3>
<p>迎來市面現鈔缺少，中央儲備銀行撥款單及銀行聯合準備金，錢業準備庫所開發撥　單貼現之風益形猖獗，一般不肖金融機關，錢兌莊，攤販，及不法商人，搜羅現鈔，暗中兌換撥款單，收取高利貼水，甚至每元貼水高達二角五分之鉅。在此物價上漲聲中，市民再受貼現之剝削，共生活負擔之艱苦何堪設想，此種惡劣現象。影響民生經濟之崩潰至重且鉅，中央儲備銀行有鑒於此，爲維持金融，安定民生起見，對於撥款單貼水流弊，絕對嚴予取締，幷增加銀行錢莊領取現鈔數量，以期肅淸現鈔貼水之惡風。茲悉中儲銀行督飭檢査金融事務處，定（十八）日起，由該處檢查主任張容如，率同随員先行檢查各金融機關，每日領取現鈔是否全部按照支付客戶，及庫存現鈔悄形，有無把持囤積及以高額貼水貸放客商，收買主要商品之流弊，尤其注意一般兌換錢莊之高利貼視，查有以上悄事者，當以擾亂金融罪犯諭，送請富局懲處。按巾儲開發撥款單，原爲調劑銀錢行莊鉅額往來籌碼之用，今各行莊竟利用支付客戶提存，流通市面，實有助長通貨膨脹，刺激物價之流　，聞中儲富局對此極爲重視。</p>
<h3>航政當局籌擬　管理航運業</h3>
<p>本市　雲業近來頗趨發達，所有長江下游，及浙東沿海各綫，均已分別通航。航政富局鑒於該帆運業旣屬營業性質，有關行旅安全至軍，現爲統籌管理起見，已擬具方案呈請中樞當局核准施行中。</p>
<h3>房屋轉租執照　逾限換照罰則</h3>
<p>上海特別市財政局頃公布房屋轉租執照　限中請換照處罰暫行規則如下</p>
<p>凡本市區內房屋轉租執照效用期滿，出租人仍繼續轉租者，均須遵照本局規定期限，自行申請換照，　限不申請或申請以後不遵照指定日期剿匪換照者，均按本規則之規定分別處罸。</p>
<p>每期申請換領房屋轉租執照者，應首規定之日起，限半個月內自行申請及申請以後按照指定日請，或申請以後不遵照指定日期繳費者，加收滯納罰金一倍，預期一個月已上不申請或申請以後不遵照指定日期繳費者，加收滯納罰金二倍，逾限三個月以上不申請或申請以後不遵照指定日期繳費者，（即每年六月底及十二月底），除追繳應納照費外，加收滯納罸金四倍。</p>
<p>在執照有效期內如出租人將全部房屋收回自用者，應該該區保甲　事處證明書，立即將所領執照連同鐵牌繳由本局核銷，否則延至下期開始申請換照，一個月以後仍未將舊照繳銷者，以欠費論，除地補繳下期執照費外，照單加收滯納罰金二倍。</p>
<p>依本規則所加收之罰金，應先核完數額，通知被罸者，並於罰金繳到時，塡給罸金收據。</p>
<h3>水產業團體　督導辦法</h3>
<p>各地水產業同業公會及漁會等，事實上與實業部水產管理局公務往返，相當頻繁，而其負責者與局方之接觸，亦殊不　，然政府正式規定其與局方之關係，尚無明文，因之在辦事上頗多不便，各種漁政之推行，亦難措手，實業部有鑒於此，爰經核准辦法六條，分咨各省市政府蘇北綏靖主任公署，轉飭所屬主管隱局，　各縣市政府，通令富地水產業同業工會，及漁會一體遵照辦理。茲將辦法錄次：　水產業同業公會及漁會之設立登記事項，概由各省市主管應局或各縣市政府辦理。　水產業同業公會及漁會之任務，實業部水產管理局得依水產管理局組織條例第四條第二款之規定，行使其指導監督權。　水產業同業公會，及漁會向主管機關申請設立登記後，仍應將組織章程，理監事名册，及有關設立登記之文件，呈報實業部水產管理局備査。　凡已設立之水產業同業公會或漁會，應將前項所列各件，請報實業部水產管理局備查。　實業部水產管理局實施各種水產行政工作，對於水產業同業公會或漁會有所指飭時，應同時函達各省市主管廳局或各縣市政府査照。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>新評價辦法</h3>
<p>本市物價評議委員會，一昨開會，決定「凡列入公定價格範圍內各種重要商品價格之評完，改採協完價格之精神，由同業公會擬定送會審核決定，但爲緊急處價之必要，得先由主任委員核定公布施行，再提會追認。」羅兼主任委員對此並發表重要聲明。</p>
<p>按近來限價商品，實際上有市無貨，而仍以黑市暗售，以政公定價格，有名無實，徒然喪失法令之威信。所以致此的原因，一部分確因現實環境的束縛。誠如羅主委所言：「超越限價，揆諸法理固有未合，按諸事實，不無可原。不取締於法不合，取締則於情不忍。」所以，這次決定的新評價辦法，已經兼顧事實困難，足見當局維護商人的至意了。</p>
<p>新評儂辦法，最主要的就是採取協定價格的精神，這是當局體　商艱的表示。當然，工商界也須以最忠實的態度申請評價，尤其同業公會務必以最公允的計算員資提出。否則全體負責人負連帶責任，當局是決不寛貸的。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望新評價辦法實施後，不再有過去的有價無貨的現象。</p>
<h3>敵美利用渝軍　對日本作戰　島田班長發表談話</h3>
<p>上海日陸軍部島田報道班長，於昨（十六）日中午十二時在報道常會席上，就最近渝軍之動向，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>渝軍美國化益加深</p>
<p>今日各報載日本阿南陸相在議會中國述大陸戰况，美司令部所發表之美館軍四七五步兵師團及第一二四騎兵師團，業已運輸中國戰綫，讓國地上部隊至中國，此爲首次發表。美航空隊在中國活動，已爲衆所週知，然地上部隊即今所發表者，該部隊一部份係由空中輸來，另一部份經史蒂威爾公路而來。此特殊混合部隊，據敵方發表在緬甸密林作戰中，曾屢建功。吾人於此所應注意者，厥爲美地上部隊經印緬來華。據渝陸軍總司令部後方勤務部隊正副司令就職，在就職典禮中，何應欽及美國　問均出席參加，鼓勵努力運輸補給，與美國運輸部隊取得聯路，所謂正副司令須與美軍聯絡，而受美軍之指揮，極爲明顯。關於美軍治岸作戰及渝軍之西南總反攻，可見渝軍之美國化，日益加深。</p>
<p>美幹部隊侵入渝軍</p>
<p>據敵方發表民國三十四年二月重慶益世報載構：美國將助渝計劃整理軍隊，其目的力在蔣介石與美國在渝總司令韋特曼，協議强化渝軍，將美軍幹部隊加入。按美幹部隊設司令官一人，下分情報·作戰·補給三項工作，幹部隊中，設作戰兵器資材補充專門家，如汽車·運輸。軍醫獸醫技術人昌·通訊，均有專門人才。幹部隊向無權顧問渝軍。僅對渝軍訓練參與意見，或協助技術工作，但將來趨勢，自必藉强化之名，而侵入重慶單中，擴展其勢力，此誠爲中國前途之一大隱憂。總之，美國之企圖，乃利用渝軍對日本作戰。美援渝之補給，多數補助於美在渝之空軍，對於渝政權途有其各，事實上所得援助極少，足見美對渝方，漠不關心。觀察目前情形，芙軍之赴渝，頗爲困難，故假借助渝之名，利用渝軍對日作戰。同時美將來之利用渝軍，認爲須美國本身之軍隊化性質，如今後渝方不察，隊其詭計，將軍隊成爲美國化，則不勝遺憾。</p>
<h3>證交明日起　停止後市</h3>
<p>上海華商證券交易所，於明（十八）日起，實行變更市塲交易時問後，下午暫行停止開拍。市塲當局昨已分別正式通告經　人遵照。茲悉此次證交富局停止後市交易，關於交割之辦法，亦告改變，以前所有後市交割，係於第三日上午辦理手續，今則一律須於隔日上午結淸，實可杜絕買空賣空之投機份子活躍。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Unfolds on Okinawa Island; Japanese Tenaciously Defend the Oroku Position; Air Force Launches Continuous Fierce Attacks on Enemy Warships</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Air Base, 16th: Due to the arrival of the rainy season on the Okinawa front, aerial combat has temporarily ceased. However, ground battles have unfolded fiercely and have not paused even slightly due to the adverse weather and muddy terrain. On the 13th, approximately 320 enemy small aircraft from the northern and central airfields carried out ultra-low-altitude bombing of Japanese positions in the southern part of the island all day. Simultaneously, two enemy battleships and several cruisers and destroyers invaded the coastline near the seas of Itoman and Minatogawa, launching intense naval bombardment on key Japanese positions. Furthermore, despite being continuously suppressed by the superior enemy's intense artillery fire, the Japanese ground forces on Okinawa Island bravely launched a death-defying counterattack in the direction of Oroku, southwest of Naha, and are currently tenaciously defending the Oroku area.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Japanese Air Base, 16th: Due to strategic considerations, the Japanese forces on Okinawa are consolidating their lines, starting from the vicinity of Kuneshi, south of Itoman, and the vicinity of Gushichan, west of Minatogawa, and are bravely fighting back against the enemy's fierce attacks. If the amount of shells fired by one enemy battleship is equivalent to the bombing power of 1,500 small aircraft, then the Japanese soldiers and officers in that area are enduring the equivalent of bombing from at least 3,500 or more small aircraft. Their arduous struggle is truly beyond the description of pen and ink.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the Nansei Islands Base, 16th: On the nights of the 14th and 15th and before dawn on the 16th, the Japanese air force launched several fierce attacks on enemy warships clustered around Okinawa Island to support ground operations. Simultaneously, in coordination, separate Japanese units repeatedly attacked enemy ground air bases, causing several explosions and fires. Furthermore, after the enemy reinforced its ground air base forces, approximately 400 enemy aircraft attacked the islands along the line during the daytime on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Okinawa Gradually Enters the Rainy Season; Japanese Special Attack Squadrons Active; Enemy Mobile Units Conduct Dispersed Raids</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from a Forward Base, 16th: The Japanese forces in the southern part of Okinawa Island have concentrated their main force in the narrow area of the southern island. The ground war situation in Okinawa has become increasingly serious. As the ground battle moves south, the enemy fleet group moving southwards had several groups on the 11th near the seas of Kadena, Itoman, Minatogawa, Nakagusuku Bay, and Naha, each group with approximately one battleship, one or two cruisers, and two to three destroyers. They continued intense naval bombardment behind the Japanese ground forces. The Japanese special attack units have intensified their attacks on these fleets since June. The surprise attacks since the 6th have almost all been successful. According to radio communications from the special attack aircraft, the hit rate reached 70% to 90% on the 6th and 11th, establishing extremely great results. Okinawa Island has recently gradually entered the rainy season, with visibility reaching about ten kilometers. This is an opportune time for the special attack squadrons to break through the enemy fleet. Because they can evade enemy aircraft interception within the dense clouds and suddenly rush into the enemy aircraft's airspace, this special attack tactic has greatly discomfited the enemy for the past four or five days. Furthermore, the Japanese special attack squadron's kamikaze attacks have become more frequent since the fierce volunteer corps forcibly landed, causing the enemy's patrol aircraft to be extremely exhausted. During their panic, on the 9th, four [unclear] aircraft were dispatched to attack two enemy warships. The first aircraft dispatched that day broke through the abdomen of an enemy cruiser, and the second aircraft then rushed into the hole. This is a unique Japanese tactic.</p>
<p>Kyushu's Minamidaitōjima and Truk Attacked by Shelling</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 16th: The Japanese forces fighting bravely in the southern part of Okinawa Island have continued to fight bravely against the superior forces of the enemy who have invaded and occupied Gushichan, Tomigusuku, Senaha, and the northern examples of Itoman since the 6th of this month. The enemy's main attack seems to be on the Gushichan and Tomigusuku front on the east coast. The enemy dispatched a total of three divisions: the 7th Division, the 96th Division, and the 1st Marine Division, simultaneously attacking from the east coast. The Japanese forces in the small team area, despite being surrounded by the overwhelming enemy forces, are still bravely fighting back, causing the enemy to bleed heavily. Now, the enemy mobile units in the [unclear] aspect, because the aid to the landing operation at the time of landing and the work of sea patrol and imitation has been completed, and because more than ten land bases have been established, the mission of the team in the future has been converted to [unclear] the air force bases. This mobile unit has recently been patrolling near Minamidaitōjima, Kyushu, with a small number of warships, and has repeatedly attacked Minamidaitōjima, Kyushu, with [unclear]. Until the night of the 10th, a small number of mobile units fired on Minamidaitōjima from warships. On the 14th and 15th, a small number of enemy mobile units appeared in the Truk area, with a cumulative total of 100 aircraft coming each time. On the 15th, they launched naval bombardment. On the 14th, one [unclear] enemy [unclear] approached the coast near a certain island and shelled the land. This kind of tactic is probably because [unclear] the power of the special attack tactics, so they are dispersing their military strength and harassing various places.</p>
<h3>Minefields Laid in Sumo Bay and Other Places</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 16th: At 1:35 AM on the 16th, more than ten enemy B-29 aircraft mainly dropped mines in Sumo [Bay], and then moved north, dropping similar mines in Tōyama Bay before fleeing south. Also, at 0:50 AM on the same day, more than ten B-29 aircraft that gradually entered dropped mines in the western Yamaguchi and Kanmon area of Suo. In addition, another five [unclear] B-29 aircraft gradually entered one by one from the sea west of the Chita Peninsula at 1:00 AM on the same day, moving near [unclear] Goto Islands and near Hakata [Bay], dropping mines.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft and Warships Attack Truk Island</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from a Central Pacific Base, 16th: On the 14th, the enemy used 60 carrier-based aircraft, and on the 15th, they used 20 carrier-based aircraft to attack the Japanese base in the Truk area. At that time, several aircraft were shot down and destroyed by Japanese forces. Furthermore, on the morning of the 15th, several enemy cruisers and destroyers sailed into the island and [unclear] fired artillery. The Japanese forces stationed there engaged them and repelled them.</p>
<p>The US and UK Mobilize Naval and Air Forces to Prepare for the Next Operation</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 16th: The enemy forces on the Okinawa front, despite suffering enormous sacrifices from the continued fierce attacks of the Japanese naval and land special attack units, are still repeatedly launching attacks. It is expected that they are controlling the Japanese forces in that sea area and simultaneously seem to be rapidly preparing for the next invasion operation. The enemy's visits to Okinawa by [unclear] Spruance's Fifth Fleet and Halsey's Third Fleet, the transfer of the Sixth Air Force under Doolittle stationed in the British mainland to East Asia, the meeting in Manila between Macworth and Stilwell, and the detachment of the air force under Mia from the Southeast Asian [unclear] Army Headquarters all [unclear] indicate that the enemy camp is either gradually invading or expanding coastal operations on the mainland. Although we must not hastily make unwarranted assumptions, no matter what offensive the enemy takes, the scale of the general air attack on Japan from now on and the frequency of its attacks will be unprecedentedly intense. This is an inevitable fact. We have fully predicted that the enemy will build more bases in the Okinawa sea area to coordinate with the air force from the Mariana base to attack Japan, and for this reason, the enemy's carrier-based air force will also be deployed to bomb simultaneously. We must also pay attention to the movements of the enemy on the mainland. Intelligence reports that Mia's US Air Force Command in East Asia and the US 20th Bombardment Squadron, which had a base in India, have simultaneously moved to the Mariana Islands. We can learn from this that the enemy will launch air battles toward the mainland, which is quite noteworthy. If the enemy uses the Air Force's air force to strengthen the air force's lineup in Tianping and the mainland, it is expected that a major air attack on the Japanese mainland is currently underway. US President Truman stated that the future war against Japan will use an air force of 3.5 million troops. Doolittle also said, "In the war against Japan, we will first weaken Japan with air raids so that our ground forces can land on the mainland." Therefore, if the enemy wants to land on the mainland, they will inevitably use a large amount of air force to try to eliminate the final battle capability of Japan. The reason why they are so carefully preparing for a new operation is that the enemy has learned from the experience of the Okinawa operation that the closer the invasion of Japan becomes, the greater the difficulty and the more terrible the damage. Based on past island warfare experience, the US military continuously strengthened supplies and reinforcements for the landing forces, but the Japanese forces had no assistance, but the US military still suffered great damage. When the landing operation on the Japanese mainland is launched, Japan can use all its combat power and pour it into the battlefield. On the contrary, the US military's supply and reinforcement will be more difficult than before, so there is a great possibility of failure in the US military's operation. The enemy has been shocked by the Japanese special attack squadron, so the enemy headquarters decided to first devote all its efforts to attacking the Japanese special attack squadron, otherwise, they will never win the landing operation on the Japanese mainland. Due to this view, they attempted a scorched earth bombing tactic to completely destroy Japanese special attack bases, production facilities, and transportation facilities, and to eliminate the Japanese people's will to fight by shelling and bombing. However, no matter how the place is bombed, it is only a preparatory work for the landing operation. The one who decides the final victory is the decisive battle of the main force of the land forces. The one hundred million people of Japan all have the special work spirit, and they are determined to defend the rent to the end. Therefore, if the enemy dares to land on the Japanese mainland, they will inevitably be severely countered and annihilated by the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>On the Problem of Food Production Increase in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>— Chen Yaoxi</p>
<p>On Reclaiming Wasteland: On the Topic of Increasing Food Production in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>The aforementioned improvements in cultivation techniques are based on increasing the yield per unit area. Now, I will discuss it from the perspective of expanding the cultivated land area.</p>
<p>The so-called expansion of the cultivated land area does not mean expanding the cultivated area of a specific crop, but expanding the cultivation [unclear] of all crops. After the war, due to the imbalance of control by the government, the change in wartime demand, and the exhaustion of rural finance, the cultivated area of various crops in rural Jiangnan has changed greatly. For example, after the implementation of cotton control in the 31st year, coupled with the increase in food demand and the lower production costs at that time, farmers mostly converted cotton fields to plant miscellaneous grains. As a result, the production of miscellaneous grains increased, while the production of cotton decreased. However, using the wasteland reclamation method to expand the cultivated land area, the increase in production is absolute, and its value is extremely great.</p>
<p>How many emperors did China have? The Statistics Department of the Ministry of the Interior, from February of the 18th to the 19th year, based on the reports from 567 counties in 21 provinces, counted that the area of wasteland in the country was 1,177,340,261 mu. Among them, Jiangsu Province reported 35 counties with more than one million mu of wasteland. The wasteland in each county that has not been reported and applied for participation should be at least over 500,000 [unclear].</p>
<p>After the Incident, the rural areas were affected by the war and [unclear] harassment, and a part of the excellent farmland fell into a state of inability to [unclear]. There is no [unclear] to deny that the area of wasteland has increased. Therefore, to expand the cultivated land area, ensuring public security is the most important thing. The yield per unit area of newly reclaimed wasteland is often less than that of cultivated land due to the infertility of the soil; and the cost required for wasteland reclamation is also greater than that of cultivated land. Under the weight of benefits, farmers feel powerless. Although the government has established measures to encourage wasteland reclamation, granting a subsidy of 300 yuan per mu for reclamation expenses, the soaring prices make this a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>In short, the government should actively seek to ensure public security, and then add generous monetary subsidies. Then, the interests of farmers can be guaranteed, and the economy can be assisted. The wasteland reclamation of Jiangsu Province should not be [unclear] promoted. In the counties of Jiangnan, the existing cultivated area can be increased by at least 20%.</p>
<p>On Disaster Prevention: On the Problem of Food Production Increase in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>Crop disasters can be divided into two types: meteorological disasters - floods, droughts, and winds; and insect and pest disasters - [unclear] and various diseases.</p>
<p>Due to the immaturity of water conservancy facilities and the complexity of the geographical environment in our country, local disasters occur every year, such as the perennial floods in the Yellow River Basin and the perennial droughts in the Northwest Plateau. Taking Jiangsu Province as an example, the low-lying fields in the Taihu Lake Basin are more than the high-lying fields, such as the southeastern part of Wujiang, Changshu, Wujin, Jiangyin, and Jintan, the northeastern part of Qingpu, Songjiang, Yixing, Taicang, Kunshan, and Wuxi, and the northeastern part of Wuxian and [unclear] are all low-lying fields. Once there is a year of continuous rain, its production is greatly affected. It is necessary to build high field dams and dredge river channels to protect them.</p>
<p>The situation of pests and diseases is even more serious. For example, in the autumn of the 30th year, when [unclear] was the most severe, there was no rice to harvest in Wuxi and Jiangyin, Jiangsu. Some farmers only carried bamboo baskets to the fields to pick up the more solid rice ears. The yield of one mu was not enough for the whole family to eat. The better ones lost more than half of their crops. Taking Jiangyin as an example, the county has 800,000 mu of rice fields. Each mu loses at least one shi of rice due to the harm of [unclear]. If calculated at the rice price of about 100 yuan per shi at that time, the loss is often more than 80 million yuan. In the 32nd year, the fields in Wujin area that suffered the most from rice borers had more than 70% of the plants damaged.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the perspective of disaster prevention, in addition to the widespread construction of water conservancy projects, the prevention and control of rice borers must also be actively promoted. For example, vigorously practicing winter plowing, burning [unclear] rice roots, buying rice moths and rice eggs, and adopting suitable rice fields, etc., food production can be guaranteed, and past losses can be easily reversed.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>To sum up, the problem of food production increase in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>has a significant relationship to the following viewpoints:</p>
<p>The perspective of variety improvement and promotion of superior species.</p>
<p>The perspective of improving cultivation techniques.</p>
<p>The perspective of wasteland reclamation.</p>
<p>The perspective of disaster prevention.</p>
<p>Now, the 21 counties of Jiangnan produce 27.9 million shi of rice annually. If we can make efforts in various aspects according to the above points, we can increase production by half, which is 10 million shi, and provide food for 5 million more people. This can be asserted. (The End)</p>
<p>Weekly Review</p>
<h3>Countermeasures to Stabilize Grain Prices</h3>
<p>— Chen Yingchuan</p>
<p>In recent years, the rapid rise in grain prices has occurred several times each year, and each time it has triggered a simultaneous rise in other commodity prices. The theory that grain prices lead commodity prices lies in the fact that grain prices can affect wages, and wages in turn affect production costs. The level of commodity prices often shifts based on the amount of costs consumed during their production process. In terms of value theory, all costs can be reduced to labor or wages, and these two are determined by the price levels of the minimum necessary living goods for those directly engaged in production labor. Among the so-called necessities of life, food ranks first, so it is obvious that grain prices are the root of determining commodity prices.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned theoretical foundation and past facts, the relationship between grain prices and commodity prices does indeed have a close correlation: high grain prices mean high commodity prices, and low grain prices mean low commodity prices. However, there are many reasons for price fluctuations, and grain prices are just one of the many important reasons. We certainly cannot attribute the relationship of commodity price fluctuations entirely to grain prices; however, we cannot ignore the impact of grain prices, especially the recent surge in grain prices, which has very clearly promoted a simultaneous surge in other general commodity prices.</p>
<p>For example, comparing the market prices of several essential living goods in Shanghai, such as white rice, soybeans, firewood, and cloth, assuming that the average price in January of this year is set as the base of 100, then the market price index for white rice in May was 398.8, and the index on June 13th was 1768.8; the market price index for soybeans in May was 322.4, and on June 13th it was 1856.9; the market price index for firewood in May was 147.5, and the index on June 13th was 631.5; the market price index for cloth (Dragon Head fine cloth) in May was 364.7, and the index on June 13th was 791.8. From these indices, it can be seen that after the price of rice rises, other commodity prices also rise. The market price of soybeans, which can also be said to represent the price of miscellaneous grains, has recently exceeded the price of rice in its rate of increase.</p>
<p>This recent surge in rice prices has its own complex and intricate reasons; however, the insufficient stock in producing areas, the period of shortage before the new harvest, transportation difficulties, and artificial speculative manipulation are the main factors. Due to the current high price of rice, which is beyond the purchasing power of the general public, there is a considerable tendency to substitute it with miscellaneous grains. As a result, the eyes of speculators have shifted to miscellaneous grains, causing the market price of miscellaneous grains to rise continuously, and its rate of increase has actually exceeded that of rice. In today's rice shortage, in the future, the food supply for citizens will inevitably be substituted by miscellaneous grains; however, the high price of miscellaneous grains is already a burden that the general public cannot bear. In principle, the current situation of miscellaneous grains is not comparable to that of rice, and there is no reason for the price of miscellaneous grains to surge so drastically. Therefore, this phenomenon is nothing more than artificial monopolistic manipulation, which really cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The price of grain has promoted the high rise in other commodity prices. This has been proven from the facts, or inferred from theory, proving that the price of grain is the central force determining commodity price fluctuations. It can even be said that the rise and fall of commodity prices in the future will be determined by the level of grain prices. Therefore, stabilizing grain prices must necessarily start with the grain prices themselves. Even if one wants to stabilize other commodity prices, one must first stabilize grain prices. Furthermore, food is a necessity of life, and it accounts for a large proportion of the minimum cost of living. Stabilizing commodity prices is certainly necessary; however, it is especially necessary to stabilize grain prices. Therefore, we must seek to stabilize grain prices as soon as possible to secure people's livelihood.</p>
<p>As for how to stabilize grain prices? There are many ways to talk about stabilizing prices; however, based on past experience, we must prescribe the right medicine for the illness. We feel that the following points must be implemented first:</p>
<p>First, we must make farmers happy to produce. In recent years, the contribution of rural areas to cities cannot be said to be small; however, how much benefit have the farmers actually received? To make them happy to produce, we must enable them to obtain real benefits. The prerequisite is to completely eliminate the obstacles hindering production, such as the elimination of miscellaneous taxes, the establishment of public security, and the rationalization of procurement. The most important point is procurement. The central authorities, in view of the recent surge in rice prices in various places, have decided to implement emergency measures: 1. The procurement work of the Rice Control Committee and all other organizations will be temporarily suspended. 2. The current restrictions on rice movement will be immediately lifted. From the first point, it can be seen that the procurement methods will be reformed in the future, or merchants and others may freely participate in the procurement, subject to the supervision of the authorities. Here, there are some minor observations. In the past, whenever agricultural products were purchased, a large amount of cash would flow to the rural areas. From the facts, farmers did not find this interesting. Originally, farmers sold their surplus agricultural products in order to purchase the materials needed for their lives and production. If it were possible to exchange the food needed by the cities with the physical goods needed by the rural areas, each supplying what they have to spare and taking what they need, farmers would be very welcome. If it is possible to cater to the traditional concept of farmers valuing gold, when purchasing agricultural products with cash, attaching a portion of gold would certainly make farmers happy to provide their products.</p>
<p>Second, sanction speculation in miscellaneous grains and purchase miscellaneous grains to transport to Shanghai. Currently, during the period of shortage before the new harvest, the stock of rice in rural areas may not be abundant, and it may not be sufficient to supply the large needs of non-rice producing areas. We must recognize this point, and under the current situation, we can only supplement with miscellaneous grains, or even switch to using miscellaneous grains. However, the current price of miscellaneous grains is extremely expensive, and it is beyond the purchasing power of the general public. Such a high price is said to be caused by artificial monopolistic manipulation. In order to suppress the current price of miscellaneous grains, we must first investigate and prosecute those who speculate and manipulate miscellaneous grains and impose the most severe sanctions. At the same time, we sincerely hope that the authorities will plan to purchase and transport miscellaneous grains from various places in Huaihai and Chongming to Shanghai. Not long ago, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan suggested collective purchase and transportation of grains, which is indeed a very good method, and we hope that the authorities will assist and strongly promote its success.</p>
<p>Third, continue to implement household allocation of flour and miscellaneous grains. There has been household allocation of flour and miscellaneous grains in this city, but it has been intermittent, and the quantity is limited, insufficient for everyone's needs. However, every time the allocation starts, it has some effect on alleviating grain prices. In the future, with the assistance of all parties, the supply of wheat and miscellaneous grains, I believe, will be smooth and ample. How to use wheat and miscellaneous grains as civilian needs for allocation at one time, and to make it reasonable, is a current topic that should be studied to stabilize prices and secure people's livelihood. In the past, since the implementation of the allocation system in Shanghai, its achievements cannot be said to be non-existent; however, it cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory. For example, the allocation is not on time and insufficient in quantity; there are those who falsely report and fraudulently receive, and there are those who receive multiple copies per person; retailers deduct portions or allocate inferior quality similar materials; the wealthy already have many items stored, and they still enjoy allocation. All of these are phenomena that should not exist in a reasonable allocation. Therefore, future allocations must be valuable in terms of reasonableness and thoroughness.</p>
<p>Fourth, restrict the quantity of grain storage. After the restrictions on rice movement are lifted, it is even more necessary to emphasize the restriction on the quantity of grain storage; because if grain storage is not restricted, then those with money can freely compete to purchase, giving "merchants" the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in great harm to the public. In the past, the municipal government had explicitly ordered that the amount of rice storage should not exceed three months' worth of needs. Now, in order to prevent hoarding of food, the previous order should be reiterated and strictly enforced.</p>
<p>The above four points are only principles. If Changtong thinks they can be adopted, please conduct further research, formulate implementation methods, and put them into practice. Finally, I want to add a few words: everything, if you want to responsibly achieve results, there are difficulties; but from the perspective of those actually responsible for the work, no matter what difficulties, they can be overcome. There is no time when things cannot be done, and there is nothing that cannot be done, it only depends on one's determination.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter editorial on the 14th criticized the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union in East Asia. The article stated that the purpose of the United States' war in East Asia is to control China, the Philippines, Ceylon, Madagascar, and other places economically. However, if the United States achieves this goal, then the interests of the United States will be in great conflict with the independence demands of the people of East Asia. Furthermore, Japan continues to resist stubbornly, and the Soviet Union has also expressed great concern about East Asia after Germany's surrender. Although the United States hopes that the Soviet Union will also participate in the negotiations, the Soviet representative's attitude is completely opposite, showing that the Soviet Union cannot ignore the United States securing its base in Central Asia. The Soviet Union's goal is to maintain a balance of power.</p>
<h3>Cambodian Foreign Minister Discusses Wartime Realities in Japan</h3>
<p>Phnom Penh, 16th (Central News Agency) – After declaring independence, the Kingdom of Cambodia convened its first national provincial governors' meeting on the 11th. After the meeting, the provincial governors gathered again at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to receive instructions from Sun K'o-tang, the Foreign Minister recently returned from Japan. At that time, the Foreign Minister gave a detailed lecture on the wartime situation in Japan for an hour, which greatly excited everyone. The main points are as follows: Cambodia's liberation and declaration of independence relied on the strong assistance of Japan. In order to repay Japan's assistance, we must do our best to cooperate with Japan. I recently returned from Japan. Japan is now concentrating all its efforts on the decisive battle on the mainland. Now is the time to fully develop its manpower and material resources. Japan now possesses planes, tanks, cannons, etc., piled up like mountains. This is a fact I personally witnessed. Therefore, Japan's mainland defense can be described as impregnable. The morale of the people is extremely high, which is really amazing. Moreover, all the people are living in wartime conditions. The potential strength and the solidarity of the nation are really admirable. If the Allied forces land on the ironclad Japanese mainland, all Japanese people, regardless of men, women, or children, will be mobilized to fight the common enemy with passionate patriotism and vow to kill the enemy. I firmly believe that great Japan will never be defeated. Since my return, this conviction has become even more profound.</p>

<h3>Procedure for Changing Price Evaluation: Adopting Agreed-Upon Prices; Price Stabilization Committee Chairman Luo Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Our city's Price Evaluation Committee, after Secretary-General Luo Junqiang was appointed by the municipal government to concurrently serve as chairman, held its 17th meeting yesterday. All committee members agreed that the past evaluation procedures were too cumbersome, and the evaluated prices often became outdated, and advocated for appropriate changes to meet the needs. Therefore, a unanimous resolution was passed: "For the evaluation of prices of various important commodities previously included in the scope of official fixed prices, the spirit of agreed-upon prices will be adopted. Trade associations will draft proposals and submit them to the committee for review and decision. However, in cases of urgent necessity, the chairman may approve and announce implementation first, and then submit it to the committee for ratification." It is believed that the management of prices in this city will be further strengthened, and the legitimate profits of merchants and the public will be appropriately taken into account. The difficulties of excessively cumbersome procedures in price evaluation can also be avoided. Regarding this matter, Mr. Luo issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Luo's Statement</p>
<p>"According to central government regulations, price limits on important commodities should be evaluated reasonably by the Price Evaluation Committee, based on applications from trade associations and with reference to actual costs. Recently, general prices have been rising daily, and the prices of important commodities have increased accordingly, leading to situations where prices exceed the set limits. This is inconsistent with legal principles, but not entirely unjustified in light of the facts. The evaluation of price limits by the Evaluation Committee requires prior investigation and continuous review, followed by discussion in the Evaluation Committee, and then official determination by the committee. The process is lengthy, and the time required is extensive, resulting in the evaluated price limits often losing their timeliness. This makes enforcement and crackdown difficult. Not cracking down is illegal, but cracking down is unbearable. This is not due to inherent defects in the organization of the Evaluation Committee itself, but rather because the method of using its authority is not entirely suited to the current environment. In light of this, the committee, in its 17th meeting, resolved that in the future, the evaluation of prices of various important commodities included in the scope of official fixed prices will adopt the spirit of agreed-upon prices, with trade associations drafting proposals and submitting them to the committee for review and decision. However, in cases of urgent necessity, the chairman may approve and announce implementation first, and then submit it to the Price Evaluation Committee for subsequent ratification, so that merchants will not be affected by excessively low price limits, and crackdowns can be precisely prepared. However, this action by the committee does not diminish the inherent authority of the Evaluation Committee in the slightest; it merely assigns greater responsibility to the trade associations. It is hoped that the various trade associations will conduct thorough investigations and careful discussions in formulating reasonable prices, and attach accurate supporting documents. The committee will promptly approve and announce all those it deems reasonable. Special attention must be paid to implementation, so that crackdowns can be further strengthened and the past abuses of discussion without action can be completely eliminated. Should anyone abuse their authority to deliberately raise prices in an attempt to obfuscate and profit, all responsible persons of the association shall bear joint and several liability and will be severely punished according to the law without leniency. Once price limits have been approved and announced, merchants and the public must comply and may not exceed them. In addition to strict crackdowns by the economic security police of the police department, this statement is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>Eight Kinds of Coarse Grains: Sold at Parity Prices Starting Today; Limited to Five Jin Per Person</h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices have soared, and the prices of coarse grains have also been rising continuously. The future of food security in this city has reached a serious stage, causing concern among informed individuals. The municipal authorities are currently making every effort to procure coarse grains and improve transportation in order to stabilize the people's food supply. It is reported that the responsible persons and members of the city's Coarse Grain Trade Association, fearing that grain prices will continue to rise and affect people's livelihoods and social order, have designated eight kinds of coarse grains, such as red beans, that can replace rice, and have submitted proposed parity prices to the Economic Bureau for approval and implementation. The Economic Bureau believes that these merchants are deeply aware of the righteousness and deserve commendation, and has approved a trial implementation, provisionally scheduled to begin on the 17th of this month. Citizens may purchase five jin per person with a residence permit, for a period of fifteen days. The prices in the list should be reviewed every three days, and adjustments may be made at any time if special circumstances arise. The Coarse Grain Trade Association has been instructed to inform its members to comply and distribute parity grains widely to alleviate the people's food shortage. This matter concerns the livelihoods of all citizens. It is hoped that other daily necessities industries will quickly follow suit and continue the coarse grain industry's initiative to automatically implement parity prices.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices in This City: Stop Rising and Fall Back</h3>
<p>The National Government, in order to suppress rice prices and improve supply channels, has implemented emergency measures, deciding to halt procurement work by all controlled agencies and abolish restrictions on rice and grain movement. At the same time, Allied authorities have also decided to cooperate with the National Government's measures and stop purchasing military rice. Upon hearing this news, all sectors of the city expressed support for the government's wise measures. Yesterday, rice prices immediately stopped rising and fell back. It is hoped that the people's livelihood can be restored in the shortest period of time. It is learned that the relevant Needs Bureau has dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate illegal merchants who secretly stockpile and hoard, in order to prevent rice merchants from taking advantage of the permitted free procurement and transportation opportunities. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank is strictly inspecting financial institutions to prevent loans from being used to privately hoard rice and grain.</p>
<h3>Narrow Bed Sheets and Curtain Fabric: Approved for Exemption from Purchase</h3>
<p>Since its reorganization, the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the Business Control Association has, in accordance with the provisions of the organizational regulations, taken over the Temporary Management Committee for Purchased Yarn and Cloth of the Business Control Association, and established a department to handle the unfinished matters of previously purchased yarn and cloth. It is now learned that the committee recently received requests from various yarn and cloth manufacturers to exempt narrow bed sheets and curtain fabric from purchase. After submitting the matter to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, it has been approved for exemption from purchase. The committee has begun processing the application procedures, and in consideration of the difficulties faced by merchants, it has decided to expedite the application procedures for yarn and cloth merchants. Applications will be accepted and processed immediately upon arrival. It is hoped that yarn and cloth merchants will not be misled and exploited by intermediaries.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Holds Judicial Conference</h3>
<p>The Third Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to strengthen judicial work and promote crime prevention, convened its fourth judicial liaison meeting yesterday (16th) at the Police Bureau's seventh floor. The meeting was presided over by the Chief of the Third Division, Li Shiyu, and the Deputy Chief, Xian Erlang. Officials from judicial organs such as the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court, the High Procuratorate, the High Court, the District Court, the District Procuratorate, the Shanghai Prison, the Security Command, and the Vagrant Labor Camp, as well as the chiefs of various sections and the heads of the third divisions of various sub-bureaus, attended. The meeting was chaired by Chief Procurator Hu of the Shanghai High Procuratorate. During the meeting, discussions were held on issues such as the detention, bail, and delivery of criminal offenders, and the prevention of theft or loss of appropriation orders, as well as various other judicial issues. Detailed research was conducted, and the meeting adjourned after 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Strictly Cracks Down on Discounting of Appropriation Orders; Inspection of Financial Institutions to Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the shortage of cash in the market, the practice of discounting appropriation orders issued by the Central Reserve Bank and joint reserve funds of banks, and money industry reserve houses, has become increasingly rampant. Unscrupulous financial institutions, money exchange shops, peddlers, and illegal merchants are collecting cash and secretly exchanging appropriation orders, charging high-interest discounts, sometimes as high as 25 cents per yuan. Amidst rising prices, the public is further exploited by discounting, making their living burden unbearable. This kind of adverse phenomenon has a serious impact on the collapse of the people's livelihood and economy. In view of this, the Central Reserve Bank, in order to maintain finance and stabilize the people's livelihood, is absolutely strictly cracking down on the abuses of appropriation order discounting, and is increasing the amount of cash that banks and money shops can withdraw, in order to eliminate the evil trend of cash discounting. It is learned that the Central Reserve Bank has ordered the Financial Affairs Inspection Office to begin inspecting various financial institutions tomorrow (18th). The inspection will be led by the head of the Inspection Office, Zhang Rongru, along with accompanying personnel. The inspectors will check whether all cash withdrawn each day is fully used to pay customers, and the status of cash reserves, to see if there is hoarding and lending to merchants at high-interest discounts, or purchasing of major commodities. They will pay particular attention to the high-interest rates charged by general money exchange shops. If any of the above are found, they will be prosecuted as financial crimes and sent to the Wealth Bureau for punishment. The Central Reserve Bank's issuance of appropriation orders was originally intended to regulate large transactions between banks and money shops. Now, various banks and money shops are using them to pay customer withdrawals and circulate them in the market, which is actually helping to fuel inflation and stimulate prices. It is learned that the Central Reserve Wealth Bureau attaches great importance to this issue.</p>
<h3>Navigation Authorities Plan to Manage the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>The sailing industry in this city has been quite developed recently. All routes along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang have been opened to navigation. The Navigation Wealth Bureau, recognizing that the sailing industry is commercial in nature and that the safety of passengers is of utmost importance, has drafted a plan to comprehensively manage the industry and submitted it to the central authorities for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Penalties for Overdue Renewal of House Subletting Licenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau has recently announced the following Provisional Rules on Penalties for Overdue Application for Renewal of House Subletting Licenses:</p>
<p>If the validity of a house subletting license in this city expires and the lessor continues to sublet, they must apply for renewal of the license within the time limit prescribed by the bureau. Those who do not apply within the time limit or do not pay the renewal fee on the specified date after applying will be penalized separately in accordance with these rules.</p>
<p>For each period of application for renewal of a house subletting license, those who apply and pay the fee themselves within half a month from the prescribed date, or who apply but do not pay the fee on the specified date, will be charged a late fee equal to one time the original fee. Those who do not apply or do not pay the fee on the specified date after applying for more than one month will be charged a late fee equal to two times the original fee. Those who do not apply or do not pay the fee on the specified date after applying for more than three months (i.e., at the end of June and December each year) will be charged a late fee equal to four times the original fee, in addition to the overdue license fee.</p>
<p>If the lessor reclaims all of the houses for their own use during the validity period of the license, they should immediately submit the license and the iron plate together with a certificate from the local Baojia office for verification and cancellation by the bureau. Otherwise, if the old license is not submitted for cancellation one month after the start of the next renewal period, it will be treated as an outstanding fee, and the next period's license fee will be added, and a late fee equal to two times the original fee will be charged.</p>
<p>The late fees charged in accordance with these rules should be first verified for the amount, and the penalized party should be notified. A receipt for the penalty should be issued when the penalty is paid.</p>
<h3>Guidance Measures for Aquatic Product Associations</h3>
<p>The aquatic product trade associations and fishermen's associations in various places frequently communicate with the Aquatic Product Administration of the Ministry of Industry in practice, and their responsible persons have considerable contact with the bureau. However, there are no explicit official regulations governing their relationship with the bureau, which causes considerable inconvenience in handling affairs, and it is difficult to implement various fishery policies. In view of this, the Ministry of Industry has approved six measures and sent them to the provincial and municipal governments and the Subei Pacification Director's Office for forwarding to the relevant responsible bureaus and county and municipal governments, ordering the aquatic product trade associations and fishermen's associations in the respective jurisdictions to comply with them. The measures are as follows: The establishment and registration of aquatic product trade associations and fishermen's associations shall be handled by the responsible bureaus of each province and city or the county and municipal governments. The Aquatic Product Administration of the Ministry of Industry may exercise its guidance and supervision rights over the tasks of aquatic product trade associations and fishermen's associations in accordance with the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the Organizational Regulations of the Aquatic Product Administration. After applying to the competent authority for establishment and registration, aquatic product trade associations and fishermen's associations should still submit their articles of association, list of directors and supervisors, and relevant establishment and registration documents to the Aquatic Product Administration of the Ministry of Industry for filing. All established aquatic product trade associations or fishermen's associations should submit the items listed in the preceding paragraph to the Aquatic Product Administration of the Ministry of Industry for filing. When the Aquatic Product Administration of the Ministry of Industry implements various aquatic product administrative tasks and issues instructions to aquatic product trade associations or fishermen's associations, it shall simultaneously send a letter to the responsible departments and bureaus of each province and city or the county and municipal governments for verification.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>New Evaluation Method</h3>
<p>The Municipal Price Evaluation Committee met yesterday and decided that "all evaluations of prices for various important commodities included in the scope of official fixed prices will adopt the spirit of agreed prices, with trade associations drafting proposals and submitting them to the committee for review and decision, but in cases of urgent need, the chairman may approve and announce implementation first, and then submit it to the committee for ratification." Chairman Luo also issued an important statement on this matter.</p>
<p>Recently, officially priced commodities have been effectively unavailable in stores, but still secretly sold on the black market. The officially fixed prices exist in name only and serve only to undermine the credibility of the law. Part of the reason for this is indeed the constraints of the real world. As Chairman Luo said, "Exceeding the set price, if judged by legal principles, is inherently inappropriate, but in light of the facts, it is not entirely unjustifiable. Not cracking down is illegal, but cracking down is unbearable." Therefore, the new evaluation method decided this time has taken into account the real difficulties, which shows the authorities' utmost concern for protecting merchants.</p>
<p>The most important part of the new evaluation method is adopting the spirit of agreed prices, which is an expression of the authorities' understanding of the difficulties faced by merchants. Of course, businesses and industries must also apply for evaluation with the utmost sincerity, and in particular, trade associations must submit the most fair calculations and information. Otherwise, all responsible persons will bear joint and several liability, and the authorities will not be lenient.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that after the new evaluation method is implemented, the phenomenon of having prices but no goods will no longer occur.</p>
<h3>Enemy Uses Yu Army to Fight Against Japan; Squad Leader Shimada Gives Talk</h3>
<p>Squad Leader Shimada of the Shanghai Japanese Army Public Relations Section gave the following talk at the daily press meeting at noon yesterday (the 16th) regarding the recent movements of the Yu Army:</p>
<p>Americanization of the Yu Army Deepens</p>
<p>Today's newspapers carry a description by Japanese Minister of the Army Anami in the Diet of the war situation on the mainland. The American headquarters has announced that the 475th Infantry Division and the 124th Cavalry Division of the American Army have been transported to the Chinese front lines. This is the first time that ground troops from the United States have been publicly sent to China. The activities of the American Air Force in China are already well known, but the announcement about ground troops indicates that a portion of these troops were transported by air, while another portion came via the Stilwell Road. This special mixed unit has reportedly repeatedly achieved victories in the jungles of Burma, according to the enemy. What we should pay attention to here is the fact that American ground troops are coming to China via India and Burma. According to the inauguration of the commander and deputy commander of the rear service unit of the Yu Army General Headquarters, He Yingqin and American advisers attended the inauguration ceremony and encouraged efforts to transport supplies and establish contact with American transportation units. It is obvious that the so-called commander and deputy commander must liaise with and be commanded by the American army. Regarding the American amphibious operations and the Yu Army's general counteroffensive in the southwest, it can be seen that the Americanization of the Yu Army is deepening.</p>
<p>American Cadre Troops Invade the Yu Army</p>
<p>According to enemy publications, the Chongqing Yishibao in February of the 34th year of the Republic reported that the United States would assist the Yu government in reorganizing the army. The purpose of this plan is to strengthen the Yu Army through an agreement between Chiang Kai-shek and the commander of the American forces in Chongqing, General Wedemeyer, and add American cadre troops. According to the structure, the American cadre troops have one commander, and under them, three departments are responsible for intelligence, operations, and supplies. The cadre troops have specialists in the supply of combat weapons and equipment, such as automotive and transportation experts, medical and veterinary technicians, and communications personnel. The cadre troops have no right to advise the Yu Army; they only provide opinions on training or assist with technical work. However, the future trend will inevitably be to expand their influence in Chongqing under the guise of strengthening the army. This is a major hidden worry for the future of China. In short, America's intention is to use the Yu Army to fight against Japan. The majority of American aid to the Yu government is used to support the American air force in Chongqing, and the aid to the Yu government is limited. The fact that they receive very little aid shows that the Americans are indifferent to the Yu government. Looking at the current situation, it is quite difficult for American troops to go to Chongqing, so they use the Yu government to fight against Japan. At the same time, America believes that the Yu Army must be militarized in order for it to be used by America in the future. If the Yu government does not realize this plot and allows its army to become Americanized, it will be deeply regrettable.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange to Suspend Afternoon Trading Starting Tomorrow</h3>
