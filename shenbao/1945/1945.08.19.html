<p>鎖上無重要交通可言，僅南大　，北大街，東街，西街，典當街等石塊路數條而已。鎭外之交通，則有陸路水路可分：陸路可通卡車，小汽車，人大車，三輪軍，自由車等。東有公路通程家橋漕河涇，可達上海。南有公路通莘莊，可搭滬杭鐵路之火車，西北公路有長途汽車，可達靑浦縣城。水路則可航各種民船，沿蒲滙塘而西，可逹泗涇，繞道又通靑浦松江。沿蒲匯港而東，可達上海，但因年久失修，幫於徐家滙處淤塞，　成死水，臭不可聞。惟蘇州河及南黄浦璽道尚通。</p>
<p>政治</p>
<p>塘南屬松江縣政府統轄，塘北屬靑浦縣政府統轄，各有區公所鎭公所等機關。區公所內有區長一人，係縣政府委派；助理員兩名，所員十條人，均由區長聘請，共同治理區政。鎭公所內有鎭長一人，係當地人民公推才高德望者任之，為人民排解糾紛。此外有土地局，錢糧局，煙酒稅局等收機關，約七八處，亦有警察局維持治安。</p>
<p>物產</p>
<p>七寳鎭及其近　之物產，以農作物為主，其中以米，棉，大豆在為大宗。其他如麥。　豆。玉蜀委。蔬菜等，亦有相當產量。水果有西瓜，黃金瓜，水蜜桃等。此外居民所畜養豬·羊·鵝·鷄·鴨，為數亦不在少。水護有鯽魚·塘鯉魚·蝦·蟹·　等。特產以香荳　亁·乳氷·　　蛤　為著者。</p>
<p>工商</p>
<p>商業以塘橋為中心，橋上有各種菜樹，點心　雜貨攤。橋南橋北有茶館。酒店·飯店·麵坊·米行·肉莊·豆腐店·衣莊·百貨店·烟紙店·糖菓店·理髮所等。工業因無電力，不能裝置馬達，僅老法草紙廠，鐵店·銅匠店·製香作·製酒廠·軋花廠·油車·木器等輕易工業。市况尚佳，並不極盛。</p>
<p>教育</p>
<p>塘北大寺塲側，有縣立中心小學，分七敎室，　學生三百餘人。校長陸康常努力教導，頗有成績。但縣政府經費奇缺，故教員待遇不但懸劣，且常有次薪之舉。塘南典當街西，有三善堂小學，校長係地方各流徐永林。該校乃慈善機關，素有堂產，故教員待遇甚優，惜乎學生人數不多，僅百餘人而已。此外尙有天主堂小學，學生百餘人，分男校女校兩，絕不混合，由馬相公主持。該校教員均係「相公」「嬤嬤」，教管相當嚴格，學生程度超於滬上一般學校之上。校舍校其寬暢，地點又甚幽靜，環境非常良好。</p>
<p>綜合以上三校，僅得小學生五六百名，約合人口總數二十分之一至三十分之一，受教育之機會殊少，由此可見一般，蓋歷來家長　預，不知　子女入學之故也。</p>
<p>民風</p>
<p>當地人民大多務農，少數出外經商，故多志慮忠厚生活儉樸。男子於每日淸晨，有「排茶館」及「吃羊肉燒酒」之習慣同之工作，如背米阪貨甚至鑽鐵絲網</p>
<p>該處人民之生活，尚稱安定，故有「草屋　來攀，倒吃陳米飯」之俗諺。近年為上海「惡努文明」所染，毒品風行，睹博頗盛。吃食鴉片白麵者為數極多，麻將牌九等處處都是，聞當局正嚴厲撲減中。</p>
<p>人民十之八九信仰佛教，彼等並不知佛敎之眞諦，但知禮拜之型式而已。當地有「關帝廟」「土地堂」「九里　」「南廟」等，「觀音會」等葉體吃齋祈禱之舉，亦常有之。此外亦有「七寳天主堂」及「顧家天主堂」兩所，為法國人戰前所建，惟信仰者不多。</p>
<p>每逢三月十五日，塘北大寺塲必有「集市」，四方販　竹器，鐵器及一切應用物品者均集於此，四鄉人民不遺數千里而來，且有京戲，動物戲，變戲法，賣拳頭等娛樂。一過此時，則各種娛樂均告停頓，至多有說書及　黄。</p>
<p>該處如經上海市民開發，努力從事建設，並提倡教育，革新政治，則將來之繁榮及發展，必可指日而待也</p>

<h3>物資統制工作即日起停辦　物資移動許可事務所撤消</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會，茲以時局轉變，物資統制工作準備結束，其物資移動許可事務，暫時似無必要，故於日昨起將物資移動許可事務所宣吿撤消，其粉麥·棉業·油糧·日用品等四統制委員會所管之麵粉·小麥·大麥·雜糧·油類·棉花，棉製品及皂燭，火柴以及原料等物資移動事務，自即日起停止辦理。</p>
<h3>軍委會宣導委員接收兩路黨部　並派代表訓示一切</h3>
<p>國民政府軍事委員會宣導委員會蘇浙皖委員何民魂氏，自日前在滬成立臨時辦公署後，即積極展開宣導工作，並於八月十七日派呂斅爲特派員，顧惠公爲專員，負責接收京滬·滬杭甬鐵路特別黨部暨職工會，呂顯二氏奉命後，已在京滬兩地分別接收。上海方面兩路員工，並於昨日（十八）上午集中於老靶子路福生路口前鐵路醫院舊址，由辦公署特派秘書計衡志，代表何委員宣達中央德意，訓示一切。大意謂：</p>
<p>訓詞大意</p>
<p>「兩路全體員工，應仍站在原來崗位上，繼續服務，切勿動搖恐懼，自相驚擾，並負責維持交通，愛護鐵路，優待旅客，保管一切鐵道器材，不令有所損毀，期將此交通命脈之京滬，滬杭甬兩鐵路，完整交還國家。中央方面決本寬大仁愛之旨，特別愛護兩路員工，各員均應切實反省覺悟，重爲祖國效力」。全體員工聞訓後，無不精神振作，感奮不已。</p>
<p>又接呂斅·顧惠公二氏，原爲兩路舊員對兩路黨務亦負責有年，相信此後對中斷八年之兩路黨務暨職工會，必有新的發展</p>
<h3>保護工廠頒發吿示</h3>
<p>上海特別市警察局，對於本市公私工廠，前已令飭各分局派警妥爲保護，頃悉警局復於昨（十八）日頒發保護工廠吿示，張貼各工廠。茲將原文錄後：奉中央命令，特別保護本市工廠，任何人不得滋據破壞，如違嚴懲不貸。</p>
<h3>放欵緊縮後物價已回跌</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業，自停止往來透支之工商各業客戶放款後，市塲物價，遂吿頻頻下挫，過去操縱投機囤積之風，亦隨之根本消滅，社會民生，似呈安定。據悉金融業停止放款，僅爲自身保守而出此，物價趨向下游，係屬自然之現象，亦要謂爲市塲交易呆滯應有之情形，故行莊日來業務，異常清澹，各自經營之事業，亦未促其發展，銀聯會錢準庫票據交換數字，益見減少，行莊對內外，均以現鈔交付，開發本票非當愼重，各客客戶對行莊存支款項，尤多以現鈔爲主。</p>
<h3>兩銀行辦理結束</h3>
<p>本市復興銀行現經董事會議決，即日起開始辦理淸算，希各存戶前往提取存款，以資結束。又中日實業銀行，亦已由董事會議決辦理結束。</p>
<h3>集團採購雜糧運滬</h3>
<p>—後日起憑繳欵證領取—</p>
<p>本市民食關節委員會，前為採辦雜糧調節民食，曾發起集團採購雜糧辦法，參加單位已先繳款，茲已採購麵粉運滬，定自八月二十一日至二十三日止分發，參加單位憑繳款收據向指定處所領取麵粉，詳細辦法，見本日本版經濟局及民食調節委員會聯合廣吿。</p>
<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>私校敎職員的呼籲</h3>
<p>— 聽秋</p>
<p>提起筆來，不禁深深地慚愧！濫竽充數，雜在小敎羣裏混着生活，不免使淸高純潔的敎育界染上了瑕玷！</p>
<p>目前敎育程度的比前退降，師資人材的缺乏，是不可否認的事實；如果要考查這所以造成的緣故，歸根結蒂，無非是爲了生活問題。</p>
<p>敎師，所負責任的重大，所得待遇的微薄，也是人盡皆知的事實。雖然敎師們常常互相勉慰着：「須爲敎育而敎育，勿爲金錢而敎育。別因待遇微薄而疏怠責任。」可是誰能果眞忍着肚飢，鞠躬盡瘁呢！因此一般學識豐富的師資人材，迫不得已而另謀生計，改行他業。於是小敎隊伍裏感到了空　，給予筆者般的庸才和非師資的人們，有了插足充數的機會！</p>
<p>小學敎師的待遇，實在是微薄得太可憐！——尤其是一般「貴入爲出」的私立小學。——對於敎職員的聘用，以一學期爲定的絕對沒有中途加薪的可能和希望。以上學期論，私小的待遇，大概月薪僅一萬元左右。（不供膳宿）在初春開學的時期，似乎尙可維持個人的生活。其後，物價竟突飛猛進，日趨昂貴，到學期終了之際，一月的薪金，竟不足維持一日的生活。　着聘約束縛的敎員們，　能和其他職工般要求津貼加薪呢！？——要不幹，這緊粥不飽的職業，尙有許多羨慕的人在後等待機會哩。</p>
<p>全市萬餘的敎職員工，誰不希望當局，賜予重點配給與平價米。　除敎職員工生活上的日常威脅，以安心工作。</p>

<h3>General Conditions of Qibao Town</h3>
<p>— Lu Shenting</p>
<p>Qibao is a town located southwest of Shanghai, and it was once a major source of rice for Shanghai. It is situated 24 li from Xujiahui and approximately 70+ li from Wusong. It is bordered by Caohejing to the east, the old Shanghai County to the south, Songjiang County to the southwest, 　　County to the northwest, and Pu Song County to the north. The river "Puhuitang" runs horizontally through the territory, dividing the town into northern and southern parts. There is a large stone bridge on the river, named "Tang Bridge," which serves as the link between the northern and southern parts of the town. As it is located in the center of the town, it is the most prosperous area. The town has a population of approximately 10,000 people.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>There is no significant transportation within the town, only several stone roads such as South Street, North Street, East Street, West Street, and Pawnshop Street. Outside the town, transportation is divided into land and water routes: Land routes are accessible by trucks, cars, rickshaws, tricycles, and bicycles. To the east, a highway leads to Chenjiaqiao and Caohejing, providing access to Shanghai. To the south, a highway leads to Xinzhuang, where one can take the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. To the northwest, a highway provides long-distance bus service to Qingpu County. Water routes allow various types of civilian boats to navigate west along the Puhuitang River, reaching Sijing and, via a detour, Qingpu and Songjiang. Navigation eastward along the Puhuitang River leads to Shanghai, but due to years of disrepair, the river is silted up near Xujiahui, resulting in stagnant and foul-smelling water. Only the Suzhou River and the South Huangpu waterways remain navigable.</p>
<p>Politics</p>
<p>The southern part of Tang Bridge is under the jurisdiction of the Songjiang County government, while the northern part is under the jurisdiction of the Qingpu County government. Each has district and town offices. The district office is headed by a district chief, appointed by the county government, and assisted by two assistant staff members and ten office workers, all hired by the district chief, who jointly administer district affairs. The town office is headed by a town chief, who is selected by the local people for their talent and integrity, and is responsible for resolving disputes among the people. In addition, there are about seven or eight collecting agencies, such as the Land Bureau, Grain Bureau, and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, as well as a police station to maintain law and order.</p>
<p>Products</p>
<p>The products of Qibao Town and its vicinity are mainly agricultural crops, with rice, cotton, and soybeans being the most important. Other crops, such as wheat, broad beans, corn, and vegetables, are also produced in considerable quantities. Fruits include watermelons, cantaloupes, and honey peaches. In addition, residents also raise a considerable number of pigs, sheep, geese, chickens, and ducks. Aquatic products include crucian carp, carp, shrimp, crabs, and eels. Special products include spiced dried broad beans, milk ice, and clams.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Commerce is centered around Tang Bridge, with various vegetable stalls, snack shops, and general merchandise stalls on the bridge. Tea houses, hotels, restaurants, flour mills, rice shops, butcher shops, tofu shops, clothing stores, department stores, cigarette and paper shops, candy stores, and barbershops are located on the north and south sides of the bridge. Due to the lack of electricity, it is not possible to install motors, so only light industries such as old-fashioned straw paper mills, iron shops, coppersmith shops, incense making workshops, wineries, cotton ginning factories, oil presses, and woodworking shops exist. The market is doing fairly well, but is not extremely prosperous.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Next to the big temple on the north side of Tang Bridge is the county-run central elementary school, with seven classrooms and over 300 students. Principal Lu Kangchang works hard to teach, with considerable success. However, the county government is severely short of funds, so teachers' salaries are not only low, but also often delayed. To the west of Pawnshop Street in Tangnan is the San Shan Tang Elementary School, whose principal is the local celebrity Xu Yonglin. This school is a charitable organization with its own property, so teachers' salaries are very good. Unfortunately, the number of students is small, only about 100. In addition, there is also a Catholic Elementary School, with more than 100 students, divided into male and female schools, completely separate, and presided over by Father Ma. The teachers in this school are all "fathers" and "mothers," and the teaching and management are quite strict, with student achievement exceeding that of ordinary schools in Shanghai. The school buildings are spacious, and the location is quiet, with a very good environment.</p>
<p>Combining the above three schools, there are only five to six hundred elementary school students, which is approximately one-twentieth to one-thirtieth of the total population. The opportunity to receive education is scarce, which can be seen in general, as parents have historically not valued sending their children to school.</p>
<p>Folk Customs</p>
<p>Most of the local people are farmers, with a small number going out to do business, so they are mostly honest and simple in their ways of thinking and frugal in their lives. Men have a habit of visiting tea houses and eating mutton and drinking liquor every morning before work, such as carrying rice and loading goods, or even crawling through barbed wire.</p>
<p>The people's lives are relatively stable, hence the saying: "Live in a thatched cottage without worry, eating aged rice." In recent years, influenced by Shanghai's "evil slaves' civilization," drugs are prevalent and gambling is rampant. A large number of people smoke opium and heroin, and mahjong and pai gow are everywhere. It is heard that the authorities are strictly cracking down.</p>
<p>Eighty to ninety percent of the people believe in Buddhism. They do not know the true meaning of Buddhism, but only the form of worship. There are "Guandi Temple," "Land God Temple," "Jiuli Temple," "South Temple," etc., and there are also frequent gatherings of the "Guanyin Society" to eat vegetarian food and pray. In addition, there are also the "Qibao Catholic Church" and the "Gu Jia Catholic Church," both built by the French before the war, but there are few believers.</p>
<p>Every year on the fifteenth day of the third month, there is a "market" at the big temple square in Tangbei. Merchants from all directions gather here to sell bamboo utensils, ironware, and all kinds of useful items. People from all over come from thousands of miles away, and there are also Beijing opera, animal shows, magic shows, and martial arts performances for entertainment. Once this time has passed, all kinds of entertainment cease, and at most there are storytellers and blind singers.</p>
<p>If Shanghai citizens develop this place, work hard to build it, and promote education and reform politics, then its future prosperity and development can be expected in the near future.</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Propaganda Committee Takes Over Two Railway Party Headquarters; Sends Representatives to Instruct on All Matters</h3>
<p>He Minhun, of the Propaganda Committee of the National Government Military Affairs Commission for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, after establishing a temporary office in Shanghai a few days ago, has actively launched propaganda work. On August 17, he appointed Lü Xiao as special commissioner and Gu Huigong as commissioner to be responsible for taking over the special party headquarters and trade unions of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. After receiving the order, Lü and Gu have taken over operations in Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. Railway employees in Shanghai gathered yesterday (18th) morning at the former site of the railway hospital at the intersection of Laobazi Road and Fusheng Road, where Secretary Ji Hengzhi, specially appointed by the office, conveyed the central government's intentions and instructed on all matters on behalf of Commissioner He. The gist is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Points of the Instruction</p>
<p>"All employees of the two railways should remain in their original positions, continue to serve, and must not be shaken, fearful, or alarm each other. They should be responsible for maintaining transportation, protecting the railways, treating passengers well, and taking care of all railway equipment to prevent damage, so as to return the lifeline of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways to the country intact. The central government has decided to adopt a lenient and benevolent approach, especially protecting the employees of the two railways. All employees should earnestly reflect and awaken, and serve the motherland again." After hearing the instruction, all employees were invigorated and filled with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Lü Xiao and Gu Huigong, as former employees of the two railways, have been responsible for party affairs for many years, and it is believed that they will bring new developments to the party affairs and trade unions of the two railways, which have been interrupted for eight years.</p>
<h3>Notice Issued to Protect Factories</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Police Bureau had previously ordered all branch bureaus to dispatch police to properly protect the city's public and private factories. It has now been learned that the police bureau issued a notice yesterday (18th) to protect factories, which has been posted in various factories. The original text is as follows: By order of the central government, special protection is provided to the city's factories. No one is allowed to disturb or destroy them. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Prices Have Fallen After Credit Tightening</h3>
<p>Since the city's banking and financial industries stopped lending to industrial and commercial customers on overdraft, market prices have fallen frequently. The past practice of manipulating speculation and hoarding has also been fundamentally eliminated, and people's livelihoods appear to be stabilizing. It is understood that the financial industry's suspension of lending is merely a self-protective measure. The downward trend of prices is a natural phenomenon, and it should also be said that it is a situation that should exist in a stagnant market transaction. Therefore, the business of banks and financial institutions has been unusually slow recently. Their respective business operations have not been promoted, and the number of bills exchanged by the Yinlianhui Qianzhun Treasury has decreased even further. Banks and financial institutions pay in cash both internally and externally, and the issuance of bank drafts is very cautious. Customers also mostly use cash for depositing and withdrawing funds from banks and financial institutions.</p>
<h3>Two Banks to Be Closed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fuxing Bank has been resolved by the board of directors to begin liquidation immediately, and depositors are requested to withdraw their deposits for the purpose of closing the bank. Also, the Sino-Japanese Industrial Bank has also been resolved by the board of directors to be closed.</p>
<h3>Group Purchase of Miscellaneous Grains Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>—Collection to Start from Tomorrow Upon Presentation of Payment Receipt—</p>
<p>The Shanghai Civil Food Joint Committee, in order to purchase miscellaneous grains to regulate the food supply for the people, launched a group purchase of miscellaneous grains. Participating units have already paid. It has now purchased flour and transported it to Shanghai, which will be distributed from August 21st to 23rd. Participating units can collect the flour from the designated location upon presentation of the payment receipt. For detailed information, please see the joint advertisement of the Economic Bureau and the Civil Food Regulation Committee in today's edition.</p>

<h3>An Appeal from Teachers and Staff of Private Schools</h3>
<p>— Tingqiu</p>
<p>As I pick up my pen, I can't help but feel deeply ashamed! As an incompetent person, mixed in with the group of elementary school teachers, I inevitably tarnish the pure and noble education field!</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that the current level of education has declined compared to the past, and that there is a lack of qualified teachers. If we want to investigate the reasons for this, it ultimately comes down to the problem of livelihood.</p>
<p>It is also a well-known fact that teachers bear great responsibility but receive meager compensation. Although teachers often encourage each other: "We must teach for the sake of education, not for the sake of money. Do not neglect your responsibility because of low pay." But who can truly endure hunger and devote themselves wholeheartedly! Therefore, generally knowledgeable and talented teachers are forced to seek other means of livelihood and change careers. As a result, the elementary school ranks feel empty, giving mediocre talents like me and people who are not teachers the opportunity to step in and fill the ranks!</p>
<p>The salaries of elementary school teachers are indeed pitifully low! -- Especially in general private elementary schools that "enter as much as they pay out." -- For the employment of teachers and staff, one semester is the fixed term, and there is absolutely no possibility or hope for a salary increase in the middle of the term. Taking the first semester as an example, the salary in private elementary schools is only about 10,000 yuan per month (without providing food and lodging). At the beginning of the spring semester, it seems that one can still maintain personal life. Afterwards, prices skyrocketed and became increasingly expensive. By the end of the semester, one month's salary is not enough to maintain one day's life. Are teachers bound by employment contracts able to ask for subsidies and salary increases like other employees!? -- If you don't want to do it, there are still many people envying this meagerly paying profession, waiting for the opportunity.</p>
<p>Of the tens of thousands of teachers and staff members in the city, who does not hope that the authorities will grant priority rations and affordable rice, in order to remove the daily threat to the lives of teachers and staff members and allow them to work in peace.</p>

<h3>Fu You Orphanage Appeals for Generous Donations from All Circles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fu You Orphanage, established for four years, has successively taken in over 1,700 orphans and impoverished children. Currently, there are still over 330 children residing in the orphanage. Thanks to the support from people of all walks of life, the orphanage has been able to provide both education and care, and its scale is gradually taking shape. However, due to the recent surge in commodity prices, it is facing difficulties in maintaining its operations. Therefore, it is publicly appealing to all circles for a donation of 10,000,000 yuan in funding. Although many donations have been received from various sectors recently, the amount is still far from the target. It is sincerely hoped that kind-hearted individuals from all walks of life will generously donate, so that the fundraising target can be achieved as soon as possible, and the orphanage's relief efforts can continue. This is earnestly desired. Collection points: Room 432, Ci Shu Building, Nanjing Road; Social Services Department of this newspaper and the Xinwen Bao newspaper.</p>
<h3>International Fellowship Service Center Hosts Allied Nationals</h3>
<p>The International Fellowship Service Center of the Shanghai YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge has specially vacated a portion of the YMCA's building at Eight Immortals Bridge to provide temporary accommodation for Allied nationals released from internment camps, as well as provide food, drink, and other services. The number of people is limited to 100 men and women, and the period of stay is at most one month. The center has already twice notified the Swiss Consul General to inform the administrators of the various internment camps. Its target population is Allied nationals who are temporarily homeless, especially missionaries and members of the cultural community who came to China before the war and were immediately detained. At the same time, the center hopes that the compatriots in Shanghai will promote the spirit of human love and express their support. For inquiries, please contact the International Friendship Service Center at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, telephone number 84040. Due to the current inconvenient transportation, it is difficult for the Allied nationals to travel in and out. Those who can temporarily provide vehicles for their use are especially welcome.</p>
