<h3>政府共黨談判重開首先討論停戰原則　細目交恊商會議辦理</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕政府代表與中共代表之會談，廿七日下午五時起，繼續進行，政府方面出席者張主席羣，王部長世杰，邵秘書長力子，中共方面出席者周恩萊，葉劍英，王若飛三氏（董必武因事未到），就停止軍事衝突及召開政治協商會議兩問題之有關各事項，交換意見，約談二小時，雙方情緒均在力求具體之解決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿七日電〕政府及中共代表今日舉行非正式會議，討論未來政治協商會議佈置事宜。自十一月十七日國共談判停頓以來，此爲第一次。若干中國報紙謂協商會議不致在一月十日以前舉行，但此一日期尙未確定。杜魯門總統特使馬歇爾之蒞臨重慶，已使全國對於未來協商會議及現所進行之談判，益增關切。馬特使於上星期六抵此後，已與政府中共及民主同盟代表會談，對於彼等各自立塲，已獲得良好觀念。馬氏表示公開聽取任何人之意見。中國各報，逐日發表有關馬使之評論，每晨由譯員一人爲其誦讀中國報紙。時事新報稱馬使愛好鮮花，昨日收到蔣夫人所贈鮮花一球。報紙上所發表之洋洋大文，顯然均望入於馬使眼中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿七日電〕合衆社特派員稱：中國之和平希望，今日突轉濃厚，因停頓已達四十日之國共團結談判，已恢復舉行。衆信此事大部份應歸功於馬歇爾將軍在渝之初步活動。國共曾商人員，於下午五時集會，議定停止內戰爲議程上之第一項。共產黨方面，正式提出立即無條件停戰之書面建議。政界人士希望議定一般停戰原則，至於其他細目，則可由現定於一月舉行之政治協商會議辦理。共產軍總參謀長葉劍英將軍之與會，使一般人對談判之信念更强。此外出席圓桌會議之共黨方面人員，尚有共產黨副主席周恩來，政治協商會議代表董必武與王若飛。國民黨方面，則由外交部長王世杰，四川省主席張羣，與國民參政會議秘書邵力子代表。</p>
<p>馬歇爾首次報告認中國局勢有望</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十六日合衆電〕美代理國務卿艾克遜今日告報界稱：「馬歇爾元帥，不斷與國務院保持聯絡，報告其活動。中國局勢有望。馬帥正與中國各領袖晤談」。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛噸二十六日電〕美代理國務卿艾克遜今日告記者稱：就接得馬歇爾元帥之第一次報告觀之，渠認中國之局勢有望。艾氏此語，係答復記者所問國務院已未接得馬帥在華工作之報告而作者。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶二十七日電〕馬歇爾將軍於任美國駐華大使之最初歡日中，自各方人士收集情報。中國民主同盟東北會員周鯨文與其他會員，曾於昨日往訪馬氏，今日又作第二次訪間。馬歇爾將軍曾與周恩來同進午餐，彼時渠曾將共產黨之立塲再予檢討。經二小時之詳談後，共產黨方面譽之謂：「聽取意見之專家」，並謂渠對恢復團結談判，以及即將舉行之政治協商會議。極感興趣，且曾藉其本人之譯員，詳詢周氏種種問題，請其說瞬共產黨對中國現行情形與將來展望之見解。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶二十七日電〕美駐華特使馬歇爾元帥，述日接見各方人士，頗爲忙碌，今晟馬氏赴美大使館辦公，召集大使館，及海軍武官處，陸軍武官處等附屬機關職員談話，有所指示。晨間國府美藉財政顧問楊格博士，曾往訪，午後馬帥回拜英首相駐華代表魏亞特將軍，晚間美大使館代辦勞勃生並爲馬帥設宴。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平二十二日電〕美駐華大使馬歇爾將軍，預料將於未來四十八小時內，可能於明日抵平，今晚此間正作最後準備。</p>

<h3>英美蘇三外長決議　與我國共管日韓　並已同意設置原子能委員會貝爾納斯昨晨離莫斯科返美</h3>
<p>（本報訊）據舊金山二十七日廣播稱：三强會議經巳結束，美國務卿貝爾納期今最離莫斯科啟程返美，可於二十九日歸抵華府。預定向杜魯門報告會議經過後，在一星期內再乘飛機前往倫敦，出席一月十日聯合國第一屆全體大會。據可靠方面傳出消息：此次會議極具建設性，會議中已作四項重要決定：（一）由美英蘇中組織委員會共同管制日本；（二）朝鮮在韓國政府未臻健全前，暫由美蘇英中組織委員會五年共同代管，期滿後予以獨立，並商定美國管轄南部蘇國管轄北部（三）與匈牙利、保加利亞、義大利、芬蘭及羅馬尼亞五國簽訂和約；（該約草案已擬就）（四）對原子能問題已成立協定，央定一月間舉行大會時提出建議。此外土耳其及伊則問題，亦均提出討論。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十七日電〕莫斯科電台宜布：三强外長會議於今晨三時零三分閉幕。（格林威治標準時間，上海時間爲上午十一時零三分）美國務　貝爾納斯謂，會議有具體的收獲，最後公報將於星期五上午三時（上海時閒上午十一時）發表。美國評述員在莫斯科電台報告謂，昨日下午三外長會談六小時半，晚膳後繼續商談，昨日爲工作最緊張之日，但經過甚爲滿意，前途殊可樂觀。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十七日電〕哥侖比亞廣播公司評論員頃從莫斯科播音稱：美國務卿貝爾納斯今晨八時三十分（上海時間午後四時三十分）離莫斯科飛往華盛頓，貝爾納斯原擬取道柏林與巴黎返美，惟天氣狀况迫其改變計劃，祇得橫貫巴爾幹半島至那不勒斯，再飛加薩白侖加。蘇外委長莫洛托夫·副外委長維興斯基及參加莫斯科會議之蘇方全體代表，均往機塲歡送。英外相貝文希望今日午後離莫斯科，但未決定。</p>
<p>美國務卿談　會議極具建設性</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿七日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯於三强外長會議結束後，招待新聞記者稱：英·美·蘇三國已同意設一關於原子能之委員會。此次會議極具建設性，三國代表之間，關係至爲和諧，均能在友好精神中說明其問題。抑有一要點，余可奉告，即對公報所未記載之任何論題，均無協定是。余所以言此者，乃因若干人士欲知對於未述及之論題，是否有秘密協議，頗爲股切也。公報中將述及原子能，規定設一委員會，俟君得見公報時，即可說明關於此問題，並未討論公報所記載者以外之事矣。最後之公報將於星期五上午三時（上海時間十一時）發表，除公報所載之事件外，三外長更曾非正式的討論其他若干種事件，經互相交換意見，已爲各該國政府有所闡明，故今後將較易採取三國政府所同意之行動。貝爾納斯並表示會議中已商　「經濟協議」，其大要將在公報中宣佈之。又稱，渠在華盛頓時及抵莫斯科後，曾先後通知法大使，謂除和平會議外，不致討論其他有影響於法國政府之事件，而任何事件凡影響法國者，均將知照法方。至於有影響於中國之事件，亦不斷通知中國政府云。三外長之末次會議，在會議開始後之第十一日與第十二日舉行，前後歷十三小時有半，其間曾有兩度短促之休息，以便進膳。最後一次休息在今日午前二時三十分（上海時間午前十時三十分），一小時後，三外長緊集，簽字於文件上。</p>
<p>倫敦方面有資格觀察家相信，會議中曾討論伊朗及中東其他問題，但不致記載於最後公報中。如果一般人相信會議中會加討論之其他重要論題已獲妥協，則此次會談，將使三强合作大獲進展。倫敦方面並猜測莫斯科談話結果，可能包括盟國在遠東合作之協議，如在遠東諮詢委員會外復設盟國對日管制議會是。</p>
<h3>聯合國機構　秘書長人選</h3>
<p>潘爾遜呼聲最高</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二十六日電〕今日「紐約時報」載：最近五强在此間舉行會議時，選舉聯合國機構秘書長事，爲最初討論之主題。該報稱，美，英，蘇，中，法五國代表在二十四日集議，擬選舉安全與社會經濟理事會之委員。據悉，蘇聯所選之秘書長爲一東歐人，但其姓名未予披露。衆信此項選擇將爲西方各瞬所不滿，因彼等主張一非歐洲人擔任此職。該報謂，目前秘書長呼聲最高者，當推加拿大駐美大使潘爾遜，渠較比利時之斯柏克或荷蘭之克萊芬斯更孚衆望。英方人士雖已接獲確定之「暗示」，謂艾森豪威爾將軍不能任秘書長之職，但彼等仍表示歡迎艾氏出馬。</p>

<h3>麥師削減日皇權力　助日建民主政府　剷除統制制度使人民重獲自由獨立社會黨要求首相應由民選</h3>
<p>〔本報東京廿七日專電〕日本神道敎今已廢止，是以天皇制度之最後惡劣根源乃告芟除，封建傾向亦已逐漸在人民思想中消逝。盟軍總部改造日本最初之步驟，厥爲取銷日海陸軍省機構，一面令日本繳出所有武器。此後另一遠大之動作，則有毁滅日本帝國警察之權力以及一切自思思想之統制。同時，爲使解除日軍武裝發生效果起見，盟方在佔領初期中，又須給予日人以言論集會及信仰之自由，此外盟方復實施幣制統制，農業改革，勞工有權集體與資方交涉及平均分配食糧等政策，使人民完全脫離軍人之控制，而趨向民主政治邁進。</p>
<p>日人以前之統制生活，乃爲造成天皇制度統治權主要因素，而統治集團之利器，則爲恩俸制度與戰爭利益之分配，日皇政府收集稅則，完全出於操縱方式，以致日本人民無時無刻不爲生存而掙扎，然則以上之統制，現今業已完全毀滅，而天皇制度亦隨之而不復存在矣。日本政府根據麥帥訓令，定下月中旬，開始實行農業改革法案，該案規定每人所有土地以十二畝爲度。麥帥對此是否表示局意，尙未表示。徵收日皇財產稅二條例，正由大藏省研究擬訂中。麥帥爲扶植日本民主，各地工會商會法團已在開始組織中，新組合黨派實力亦日趨健全。日本共產黨要求大選延緩數月，俾人民思想及新政黨組織日臻健全，得與舊政黨勢均立敵，又新成立獨立社會黨要求日本首相，應改由日本人民公選，不能再由日皇任命。目前盟軍置于日本民衆前之任務，厥爲成立平等之政府，以代替至高無上之天皇政府。此爲重要之工作，必須盟軍予密切之監視與指導，以期早日促其實現，究成盟軍佔領日本之任務。</p>
<h3>國際貨幣協定　昨正式簽字　參加廿四國代表</h3>

<h3>大厦窖藏中發現　日政府檔案</h3>
<p>對審訊　犯極有幫助</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿七日電〕美佔領軍在東京以西約三十英里之孤立大廈窖藏中，發現日政府文件之全部檔案，自一八八五年以來所有日閣決議紀錄及日皇勅書，分藏於七十二隻精緻木箱內，於將來審訊東條及日高級戰犯，切實提供極有價値之資料。各件均有日首相之簽字及日皇御　。日當局對此事釋爲避免空襲之損毁，但對何以未事先報告盟軍一節，未能解釋。</p>
<h3>菲奸甘爲敵鷹犬喀斯蒂爾處死刑</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼拉廿七日電〕菲奸喀斯蒂爾，誘導菲人約一千名被日軍集團屠殺，今日由人民法庭判處死刑。喀氏在本年三月間詭稱日軍可保障安全，誘惑倫培特村民集合一處，悉遭日軍屠殺。此爲菲奸判處死刑之第一人，凡爲日人鷹犬者，已因此開一重要先例。</p>
<h3>美國計劃拓展　全球航空綫　但可開辦者僅一小部份</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕全球航空交通，可留日益發展，最後將不論何時何地，均有飛機通達。此種航空綫，美國方面已擬有詐細計劃，所需人員·設備·經費及管理人才，，亦均準備充足。但因各國政府未能同意空間商用權之交換，故現時除軍事運輸外，僅一小部份航綫，可以開辦。</p>
<p>美國空運綫正向歐洲推進，已有公司二家，與英國通航，其中一家將延長路綫至北歐諸國，另一家擬沿歐洲南部海岸，經地中海飛往埃及印度。橫斷北太平洋之大圓航綫，或將稍綏開辦，因蘇聯對於商用航空權，尙未表示態度，且北太平洋線亦從未經民航機通行，尙須多作測繪及訓練工作。</p>
<p>近來飛航最頻繁者，爲中太平洋南太平洋及南大西洋諸線，航空公司首腦除獲致航空權之政治問題外，尙有其他棘手之事，如維持地上設備，　集氣象報告，及設立通訊綢等，務使各國均無間曾。</p>
<p>政治問題導源於國家之主權及經濟問題，　難孔多，但去年在支加哥舉行世界航空會議後，已大見進步。現有三十七國所組織之臨時國際民航機術，正在研究各項問題。</p>
<p>該機構總部設於加拿大之蒙特里奧，美國不待自由空航權或立一般協定，先事與有關各國一一恊議，成立相互協定，以求暫時之解決。茍美國不如是進行，則其巨大空航潛勢力將無定期侷限於美洲一地。其他國家亦仿此辦理，英國爲其尤著渚。</p>
<p>論其成就，已有二十國接受所謂空中之「二大自由」，即相互交換飛越國境或降落他國之自由權。若干國家且已接受「五大自由」，以交換條件，准許商用航空機出入國境，簡言之，即由當事國變方簽訂協定，准許一般權利之交換由「二大自由」之推廣，已有大片不可通行之空間，獲得開放，其中若干區爲環球最重要航空線所必經者，如加拿大·紐芬蘭·英倫三島·美國·中國·印度·法國·北歐諸國·荷蘭及若干南美國家，由相互協定之成立，雙方即可確實獲得上述重要地區之航空權。</p>
<p>此外，尙有極爲困難之技術問題，在勢不可避免，此即楥塲·空路·氣象報告及通訊等設備之維持。現時此等設備，均由軍事運輸機關主持，但戰事旣終，軍事人員相繼復員，經費亦漸漸滅少，貴重設備均有撤去或丟棄之處。前述之國際臨時機構，正在考慮此項問題，並開始考查何種設備爲必需者，應如何繼續不使廢棄。如各會員國咸表同意，該機構即有權管理此項事務，或在各國間居間調整之。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕美國大陸及西部航空公司現任總理弗拉愛氏今日宣布，該公司所辦國際航空綫將由美國東飛至歐洲，取道近東而至孟買哥倫巴，再展至新加坡·香港·上海，公司方面預料可以取得航空權，自孟買哥倫巴向東展長其航空綫，至太平洋西岸，或由印度分兩路至上海。但其所擬路綫，未必由哥倫巴經馬來半島，越南，香港而至中國。另一條路綫則由印度至新加坡，再由新加坡至香港，公司所擬之遠東航空擴張計劃，或可與向西由美國經北太平洋而至上海之航空綫相聯接，公司方面並會申請開辦太平洋航空綫，一經核准，其計劃中之周游世界航空班，即可實現，擴充遠東航空事業，可以促進其經濟發展，飛機可使貿易擴張，並爲人民多造機會，航空公司可以輔助打倒貿易陣碍，增加亟需之交通運輸，希望能在最短時期內即可由關係方面獲得此項權益。</p>
<h3>蘇軍準備在德國　再留居十年　美記者報告視察經過</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林二十七日電〕在德國失敗後八個月的時間內，蘇聯紅軍已把德國東北部從一個被毁的機器變做一個和平時期的機構，而且蘇軍已準備在那義久居，—最低限度十年。蘇聯軍隊和德國自由派人士（大多數是共產黨）密切合作，最近外籍記者團，費了八天的時間，視察七百五十英里的蘇軍佔領地帶，終於發現蘇軍已經完成了些什麼工作。</p>
<p>過去數月中，德方散播謠言，說是俄軍佔領區已陷入混亂無組織狀態中，但是外籍記者視察的結果，證明蘇聯方面對於處理佔領事務，是非常現實和有效。</p>
<p>在蘇軍佔領區中，絕對沒有失業者，因爲蘇方已廢止昔日的銀行借款制度，使每一個德國人都要拿工作來換飯吃。通貨膨脹比較西部好一些，大部份非戰爭工業已經恢復工作，但是戰爭工廠不是被拆毁，就是被運去，作爲賠償之用。</p>
<p>謠傳蘇軍佔領區中已完全沒有工業活動，關於這點，德方各省官員一笑置之，目前非戰爭工廠，已經有百份之八十五開始製造消費品，活躍的納粹黨員，都被監禁起來，而有名無實的領袖人物，也經調換。對於不是激烈納粹份子的德人，蘇方的態度，似乎比美方來得寬大，目前美方已驅逐所有納粹份子，但是蘇聯方面却把這種問題交給德國民衆政府去處理。</p>
<p>五金礦產不准開工，但是所有煤礦都已在工作中。生產幾乎和戰前一樣。至於食糧，德方官員告記者稱：目前食糧供給，不能維持長久。</p>
<p>德人宗敎信仰，絕對自由，蘇方官員說：「你是不能在敎堂內製造大砲的」。</p>
<p>蘇聯當局竭盡全力，使記者們得到良好的印象，陪同記者到各地視察的一位蘇聯少校，在回到柏林之後，完全筋疲力盡，五位美國記老也相當疲乏，因爲他們曾爲蘇美友好「乾杯」，不下一萬次。</p>
<p>美記者在各地都受到歡迎和優待，蘇方雖然監視他們，但是對記者們的請求，可說是有求必應，祗有一次是例外：美記者請求視察紹林吉省，爲蘇方拒絕。理由是那個地點不在指定的視察範圍以內。</p>
<h3>美國太平洋五處空軍　歸麥帥統一指揮　俾便管制日本充實空防</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿六日電〕麥帥今日宣布：太平洋五處空軍予以統一指揮，以便管制日本及充實美廣大空中防務。此項空軍定名爲美國陸軍太平洋航空部隊，其司令一職己由前任遠東空軍司令凱納將軍昇任，並由前第五空軍司令威特中將爲副司令，克利門少將爲參謀長。其前敵司令部設於東京，此項司令部管轄五處空軍，即（一）第五空軍駐防韓國及日本，（二）第七空軍駐防夏威夷，（三）第八空軍駐防東京，（四）第十三空軍駐防菲律賓，（五）第二十空軍駐防馬里亞納羣島。各軍額員照舊，其最高統帥仍爲麥克阿瑟將軍，東京前敵司令則屬胡爾夫少將　胡爾夫曾任印度及中國方面第二十轟炸部隊司令，現兼任第五空軍司令。五處空軍中，第八及第二十兩軍原屬美陸軍戰略航空部隊，其餘三軍則屬遠東空軍部隊。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿七日電〕據今日宣布：麥帥將有新副官兩人輔佐，一爲韋勒上校，任高級副官兼陸軍秘書，一爲霍根中尉，在戰爭期內任麥帥副官者，此外僅有四人。</p>
<h3>英軍在吧城遇圍　佈置警戒綫</h3>
<p>萬隆一帶劇戰復作</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞二十七日電〕爪哇盟軍司令克里斯蒂森將軍，下令於吧城週圍佈置軍事警戒錢，以資鑑定出入吧城之人，而防土匪與恐怖份子之混入。盟軍總都公報有謂，佈置軍事警戒綫，乃安定市區秩序之初步必要措施，俾各族人民得有安全之保障。據悉軍事當局奉令採取此項措施後，尙無意外事件發生。以前吧城四郊僅有軍隊在若干要道佈崗，不若此次之嚴密。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿七日電〕盟軍即將根據新加坡會議之決議，開始新的行動。萬隆之英印軍繼續肅淸境內之極端派，曾發生巷戰，卒佔領極端派之根據地，奪獲軍火糧食衣服若干。盟軍總部謂極端派利用華人作擋箭牌，阻止英印軍之掃蕩，吧城入夜仍有錐　聲，數星期前轟擊盎巴拉華僑民營之印方大砲，又在該地以北三十哩處開始活動。</p>
<h3>美休曼少將任作戰司長</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕海軍少將休曼今日被任爲海軍司令部作戰部長。休曼少將曾任太平洋艦隊司令尼米茲之副參謀長，調任新職後，仍可與海軍軍令部長尼米茲將軍繼續合作。</p>
<h3>歐洲美佔領區　難民設法移美</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十六日電〕杜魯門總統在白宮宣言中透露：渠已訓令國務院與檢察長，加緊將歐洲美軍佔領區中之流浪者與難民移往美國，俾「减輕人類之痛苦，並爲世界別國作一榜樣」。總統力言此項救助辦法，將嚴格依照移民執行，而決不躭擱海外軍人之返國。並稱，目前之致力於歐洲，並非在世界莫他部份完全停發護照之謂。</p>
<h3>國際婦女恊會要求　推翻佛朗哥政權　法國已邀請英美舉行會議以期共同檢討西班牙問題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十六日電〕美代理國務卿艾克遜今日告新聞記者謂，美國已接度法國要求研究對佛朋哥未來關係之文件，渠稱：法國可能將召集一三國會議，並謂美國「樂於」檢討西班牙問題之各方面，衆料法國將建議與佛朗哥政權斷絕關係。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十七日電〕英美法三國召開會議，以討論對西班牙佛朗哥政府應取之態度，一俟法國決定時間及地點會議即可開始。法國近曾致牒英美，建議對西班牙絕交，英美覆牒聲言準備與法政府開會以討論之，惟英國之覆牒，並不主張目前即行絕交，而美方對於西班牙政府雖不表示同情，但對絕交一事，則保持緘默態度。美國以爲目前不使佛朗哥政府趨於穩固即可，亦毋需鼓勵更易政權。一般咸信英國政府之覆牒，必未掩飾工黨政府對佛朗哥政權之厭惡，並希望及早另立穩定之民主政府。昨夜西班牙自由電台曾喚起國民參加遊擊隊，以打倒佛朗哥政權，而巴黎之國際婦女民主協會，亦曾致電莫斯科三强外長，代表八千一百萬會員，要求推翻佛朗哥政權·該協會係於國際婦女大會閉幕後所成立，中國亦爲會員。</p>
<h3>蕭伯納建議　創新字母　俾使每一個語音用簡單符號寫成</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕文豪蕭伯納今日致函泰晤士報，籲請英政府設立委員會，起草一種新字母，俾使英人言語中每一聲音，均能用一筆及簡單之符號寫成，甚至不加點劃。新字母所節省之時間，可以立即償付大戰之代價。據蕭氏稱：發音拚音法採用後，可以代替過去强森博士之錯誤拚音法。例如bomb（炸彈）一字，應拚爲bom，略去最後無聲字母b，余在一分鐘內，可以塗寫bomb十八次，約略可辨，但bom則可寫廿四次，節省時同四分之一。至於一般人想入非非，如主張推行一種世界語之類，字母起草委員會應明白宣佈其無究格參加。</p>

<h3>雲山珠江景色不殊　新廣州向前邁進</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>白雲山一般的蒼翠，珠江水依樣地悠悠；記者回到這闊別整了整七年的廣州，目睹珠海　山，依稀如昨。雖然在這七年之間，這地方曾給陰霾範罩，產生過不少悲慘的故事，埋藏着不少血漬與淚痕，可是到而今，總算雨過天靑，雲開日出，使人不禁深深的慶幸：河山重光了！</p>
<p>當記者踏上了廣州的碼頭，首先觸着眼簾的，便是那壯麗雄偉橫架在珠江面上的海珠橋，和那　然矗立樓高十七層的愛羣酒店。看見它安然無恙，心底感到無限的慰藉；的確，雖然這兩件建築物未必就能够代表了廣州，但相信每一個廣州人隔別了這麼七個年頭，一旦回到這裏，都難免有這樣的心情罷了！</p>
<p>車水馬龍　長堤較往日繁榮</p>
<p>長堤比以前更見繁榮，路上車水馬龍，人們熙來攘往，擠擁異當；尤其在晚上，什麼大同，金輪，金龍，大三元等大酒家樓頭，更燈火輝煌，鼓樂澈耳，經當座上竟無虛席；愛羣，白宮，新華，東亞以及幾家新開的大酒店，都經常客滿，外來的旅客，非等上一星期以上，都不容易找到房間。如照這表面看來，現在廣州市面繁榮，較之戰前，寳有過之而無不及，可是，這祇是長堤一帶是這樣罷了，若果你離開了這個區域，在市區內其他的馬路上逛逛，便會覺得廣州已經殘缺不堪了！祇看西堤大新公司背後一帶罷，本來都是四五層樓以上的大廈，但現在幾乎變成一塊平地，無限荒凉，雖然有一兩幢房子巍然獨存，亦僅是一個空壳，最熱鬧的西　十八甫和城裏漢民路，今亦不復舊觀，冷靜得實在可憐。這裏沒有發現什麼新建的建築物，而原來的又大都聖落殘破，使人不免有「雕欄玉砌今猶在，祇是朱顏改」之城。每條馬路幾乎都是千創百孔的，如果坐黃包車眞會顚得屁股也發酸；滿街滿巷都是垃圾，無論那一個角落都堆滿了蒼蠅；從這一切看來，廣州在這七年淪陷的期間，是祇有破壞而無建設，偽組織的漢奸們，祇顧搜刮錢財，桎梏百姓，根本連馬路也不修，淸潔也不管，使這素稱山靈水秀，朝氣勃勃的革命策源地，彷彿變成一個萎靡不振的老人，又宛如一個衰頒的破葛戶，怎使人不痛心疾首</p>
<p>軍紀整飭　市民頓即表好感</p>
<p>在勝利以後，這裏首先入城的是別動軍，他們軍紀較差，曾留給百姓們一個較壞的印像；可是不久，新一軍開到，就把百姓們的觀感轉變過業。因爲新一軍在緬甸的戰績，也許淪陷區民衆不容易知道，但他們總會知道日本兵在緬甸打敗仗的情形，所以他們知道打敗日本人的就是這一枝軍隊，他們當然是對這班遠征的戰士們無限的欽敬與歡迎了；尤其是新一軍的裝備，完全是美國式的，鋼盔，厚卡嘰，黃皮靴，湯姆生衝鋒槍……這一切不但淪陷區民衆看見覺得新奇，就從內地回來的老百姓都似乎還沒有見過這樣裝備的軍隊，地們異口同聲在說：我們國家委實强起來了</p>
<p>治安，這恐怕是任何一個收復區都會認爲最嚴重的問題，廣州當然也沒有例外；常常會聽到匪徒持械入室打劫和街上攔途截搶的新聞，據警察局長李國俊的報告，自九月十九日接收迄今劫案發生五十多宗，說也奇怪，道些刧案多數是發生在臺灣人和以前偽組織職員的住宅，現在已破獲的却已有三十多宗了。不過軍警當局目前對治安維持，還在積極努力，晚上十時依然施行戒嚴，所有人物車輛非有戒嚴通過證不得通過，記者有一晚走不上一百公尺的路程，竟然受到五個以上的哨兵盤問，這又看見警衛嚴密的程度。以前這些哨兵是由新一軍派出的，現在由全省保安司令部保安隊來担負這個夜哨責任。</p>
<p>水燈電話　當局盡力修復中</p>
<p>自來水，電燈，電話，—這與每一個人日常生活有着最密切的關係，而目前的情形，所謂馬路不平，自來水不淸，電燈不明，電話不靈這幾句話正足爲目前廣州寫照。因爲電力廠，電話處，以至自來水廠，所有機器設備都是八年前的東西，敵偽佔據時從未有半點建設，這些機器都變成逾齡的傢伙，自來水的蓄水池竟積泥數尺，自來水管和電燈綫電話綫都日久失修，在這樣情形之下，又有什麼辦法不如此呢？所以這些問題，也是足够市政當局頭痛的。現在市府正盡着最大的努力來解決這些問題，在這兩個月來，顯然已經有了顯著的成績，現在我們天天在街上都可看見，有不少工人在修馬路，修電綫，修自來水管。同時廣州在未光復以前四五個月內，已經沒有長途汽車行駛，現在市公用局爲着維持市內交通，便將敵人遺留下來的貨車改奘爲公共汽車，這種車已經有一百多輛在行駛，而旦粟價很便宜，每張票不論遠近祗收四十元，軍人和公務員還可以半票，這給予市民不少的便利。還有一項是値得一談的，就是淸潔問題；眞不知從那裏來那麼多的垃圾，我們回來的時候，眞是遍地皆是，臭氣冲天，後來當局下了決心來大淸除，陳市長（策）也曾親自拿了掃帚在街上作示範，還利用日俘來担任這項工作，經過個多月的努力，現在當然全市聲潔得多，與過去大不同。　說到淸除垃圾，便想起日俘在廣州的情形，這也是値得報告的。這裏所點收的日軍有四·六八九人，日僑大三一七人，他們在集中營內，眞可謂飽衣足食，淸閒自在，除了被服裝具，還有襯衣，襪，肥皂，香烟等什用品都供應充足，而且駐地均極寬敞，景緻幽美，空氣新鮮，以外還有診斷室，洽療室，休養室等設置。現在每二百日俘借用步槍十枝，每槍配子彈十發，他們在這樣意想不到的優待之下，都無不感激涕零，所以目前在集中營內，他們軍風耙及治安，尙能維持良好的態勢。</p>
<p>日俘工作　任何人不喫閑飯</p>
<p>最近，當局爲了要把這班坐着吃開飯的日俘來盡量利用，除了一部份有技術專長的調去當司機，修理各種機械等工作外，其餘的都要來協助淸潔工作。現在每天淸晨，都可以看見一隊一隊的日俘拖着垃圾車或者拿着掃帶，很馴服地在那裏淸掃街道。他們還是那副老樣子，小於腦壳的尖頂帽，千縫百補的「皇」軍服，個個臘上都沒有半點表情，見了人也不敢正視，那副侷促的神色，看來也確够可憐。有一家報紙曾登過這樣一幅漫畫，繪了一個日俘肩托一柄掃帚坐在垃圾車上，題目是「日本皇軍新裝備」。又有一家賣酒的店子的廣告寫着：「他作淸道伕，我飲在歡酒。」的字句。記者一次曾和一個正在執行清潔工作的日俘，作過簡短的談話：</p>
<p>「要你們幹這樣的工作，你們有什麼感想呢？」記者很同情的問他。</p>
<p>「我們是戰敗的俘虜，一切祗有聽從命令吧了，」他用着不大流俐的廣東話答，臉上一副不大自然的笑容，掩藏不了他內心的憂鬱。</p>
<p>「你們天天拿着掃帶掃垃圾，難道一點感想也沒有嗎？」記者再問他。</p>
<p>「……其他倒沒有，祗覺得你們貴國地方的垃圾，好像老掃不究似的。」他略踟躕了一會，說了這句有刺的話。</p>
<p>「當然　，這是七年多堆積下來的垃圾，當然不是一天可以掃掉的了；還有七年來的血漬，恐怕更難洗刷得掉哩！」記者也很不客氣地回敬他一句。</p>
<p>他祗低着頭沉思，不再說話了，我們的談話也就這樣結束。</p>
<p>美輪抵粵　物價開始趨下游</p>
<p>談到廣州的物價，一個時期的確是很便宜，普通一件襯衣祗賣四五百元，皮鞋一雙三四千元，不過現在一切物價都漲了幾倍，現在襯衣普通一件要五千元以上，皮鞋每雙起碼一萬元，如果你要到洋服店定一套西裝，那就非十四五萬元不辦，據說物價天天高漲，是因爲由重慶昆明貴陽等地的來客，尤其是軍人，大家都說東西便宜，滿不在乎似的，一擲萬金無吝色，所以商賈們便坐地起價。其實這固然是理由之一，但主要的原因授是因爲存貨有限，洋船又未有貨運來，是以一切貨物都一天少比一天，所謂求過於供，那當然沒有不漲價的這理。不過從這一個星期起，因爲美輪已有兩艘到了香港，帶來不少貨物，以後當然會陸續來的，所以百貨已經開始回跌，港澳各行商都將存在廣州的貨物大量拋出，一般人士估計，這裏物價將會陸續下跌哩！</p>
<p>美國出售私人用單翼機</p>
<p>美國現正製造一種伊科伯牌私人用單翼機，並已開始接受顧客定單，每機售價二千九百九十四美元。按：伊科伯私用飛機係採旋轉式，備有降落特用輪子三具，此種飛機可乘旅客二人，並可外帶行李五六千磅。翼長三十呎，身高的近六呎，機身長二十呎九吋，最大航程可達五百哩，每小時速率一百一十哩，後舵及保持飛機平衡之輔翼均可操縱自如，並有安全設備，練習飛行時，祇需普通飛機三分之一時間。</p>
<h3>十萬萬亞洲人民齊敲和平自由鐘　力避遠東怒濤向世界冲擊　譯自十二月號讀者文摘</h3>
<p>太平洋的和平，是全世界各國和各民族間至高無上的一個問題。太平洋上有和平，世界和平就有了基礎，要是太平洋上沒有和平，全世界就將重這戰禍。</p>
<p>顯然地，在太平洋區域，我們需要一種新的生活形式；在和　敵征戰了四年之後，我們不能再要求十萬萬亞洲人回復到從前僅僅替世界上其他民族采薪挑水的生活，而認爲知足。</p>
<p>阻止敵侵略　再摧毀敵性思想</p>
<p>我們阻止了日本人的侵略，可是我們並沒有摧毁日本人隨身帶來培植在這片沃土上的一種觀念。這種觀念便是所謂「共榮圈」，其意義係指一個地理上的區域，在那兒把所有生活方式相同，皮膚顏色相同，風俗習慣相同的各民族，聯合成一個政治的整體。</p>
<p>實際上，這祗是一種虛僞號召吧了。牠祇成爲日本人的亞洲。可是這觀念的本身却是正確的，在道義上不能加以攻擊，牠將永存於亞洲，不得誣爲叛亂。這是遠東的復興。西方人能幫助他發揮成一種龐大的力量，以貢獻於和平。</p>
<p>日本人計議把亞洲各民族谷國家合併成一個單一的集體。這是太武斷，太難辦了。比較合理的想法，應當是照天然的種　支　。把亞洲人分爲三大聯邦，即馬來亞，中國，和自度。在這兒我們且將馬來聯邦的情形先說一說——馬來聯邦爲一政治和經濟的集體，包括二萬萬說馬來話的人民，他們分居在菲列賓，爪哇，西里伯，麻六甲，蘇門答臘，馬來半島，暹羅，輛甸，和越南。</p>
<p>我是生長在亞洲的。戰前不久我曾在馬來人間旅行着，經過泰國，緬甸·爪哇和海峽殖民地。不論到那兒，我都觀察到一種對於自由的渴望和對於白人的叛意。</p>
<p>在爪哇，代表情幾百萬農民的地下工作領袖們，躱在森林中的秘密機關裏，舉行着午夜會議，組織解放運動。在緬甸，各處都能聽得到要求解放的民衆呼聲—在清道夫間，在朱砂礦工間，在學生，商人，政府官吏間，都有着這種呼聲。</p>
<p>不論到那裏，我都看得到那種足以破壞人類尊嚴的可憎的種族歧視。我看見高尙的緬甸婦人踏進　　中去，讓路給白種人走。在新加坡，我看見高尙的馬來人不准進英國人的餐館和俱樂部。我看見劍橋牛津畢業的大學敎授，因爲他們不曾向荷蘭監督深深地鞠躬致敬，甚至於不准他們在本國小學執敎。</p>
<p>到處都是憔悴的褐色人們，裏着汚穢的腰卷（Sarong），臉上充滿着愁苦，簡直不做人樣。在他們中間沒有嬉戲的兒童，只是被挨俄的父母出賣，去做經濟奴隸的倒霉的小傢伙。他們不知道如何嬉戲；他們從不曾有過嬉戲的精力。</p>
<p>大西洋憲章　保障各國自治權</p>
<p>因此，當種族的仇恨獲得發洩的機會時，這是很容易了解的，爲什麼除了菲列賓以外，其餘各處所有的白人，爲了保衛他們目已的生命，不　　　禦日本人的攻擊，還得防範曾被他們侮辱了許多年的馬來人。因爲日本帝國主義可以作爲消除白色帝國主義的一種工具，這些亞洲人就先接受了牠再說，然後再來進一步　求最後的解放。</p>
<p>這種　求似乎已經在大西洋憲軍中有了答復，因爲大西洋憲章曾保證一切屬　獲得自治。然而遠東各國，却發覺此項諾言，祗在以自由給予那些在納粹桎梏下的白種人，而並不是給褐種人的，也不是給亞洲人的。</p>
<p>菲列賓之外的馬來人還談不到民主政治。他們祇說，『我們希望並且薪求以「美國」賜給我們人民」。這意思是指一種生活　度，在這種制度之下，　種人不僅龍享有自由，且得與白種人互尊互助。美國人在菲列寶的政續是這種思想的根源。他切實地證明了帝國主義者所認爲設想過高而不切實際的理論却是能够實行的。</p>
<p>馬來亞聯邦　爲人類自由而戰</p>
<p>帝國主義者認爲馬來亞聯邦的組織是不會成功的。</p>
<p>第一層理由是：各種馬來人之間沒有統一的基礎。雖然他們的語言都是屬於馬來亞諾根的，他們卻說着各式各樣的方言。他們之間往往發生械鬥，直待西方人加以阻止後，方才停止。他們的宗敎也是互相敵對的。</p>
<p>第二層理由是：根據實際紀錄，東方人在土著統治者之下所受的剝創，遠超過他們在西方人之下所受的剝削。苛征惡稅，徒飽土皇帝的私囊，供他們窮奢極慾之需。對於普通人，法庭是等於並不存在，警察制度也設法保護他們。</p>
<p>第三層理由是。這些落後民族對於自治的複雜性尙無準備。</p>
<p>現在，讓我們把馬來聯邦的情形來檢討一下看。</p>
<p>第一，我們如何敢說：自由對於菲列賓人與荷蘭人是對的，對於爪哇人却是不對的？對於中國人是對的，對於印度人却是不對的？」我們這次世界鬥爭的主旨是一切人類均當自由。</p>
<p>不錯，這些島民，在表面上是有許多異點的，可是骨子裏，他們都是相同的。　言上的歧異，並不是一種不可克服的阻碍；我們葬列賓人就有五六種不同的語言，可是我們的利害關係却是共同的，不錯，我們菲列賓人曾受本地統治者的暴歛，可是這種最可惡的事例，早已是三百年以前的陳跡了。</p>
<p>此外，還有一種剝削，在東方是很普通的。那就是大規模的商業機關干涉一國的政治利用牠們鉅大的財力來壓制人民的發展。</p>
<p>遠東殖民地　識字敎育新發展</p>
<p>識字敎育，是民族發展的一枝明確的測量器。當我們用牠來量遠東殖民地民族的程度時，我們得到什麼結果呢？荷蘭人曾在東印度羣島住了三百多年，運去無數的橡皮，奎寗，馬口鐵，油，糖，米，茶，咖啡，香料，金屬，和椰子肉，在這時期中，爪哇的識字人數，終算已經升到百分之七了。在本世紀初，荷蘭政府曾舉行一次三十年計劃。以二萬五千萬餘元資助北蘇門答　的亞淸省（其幅圓約較英國的西彿琴尼亞路小），可是在同一時期內，所定的全蘇門　　敎育預算，尙不到這個數目的十分之一。</p>
<p>在日軍侵入之前，荷政府曾准許馬來人代表三十名和荷蘭人代表二十四名，同時出席東印度羣島的衆議院。在逍三十名土著議員中，二十名是由荷蘭總督指派的。換一句話說，就是七千五百萬馬來人，只有十名自由選舉的代議士，而七萬荷蘭人却有二十四名荷蘭籍代議士，再加上二十名土著代議士。除此之外，土著就不能够在政府中佔個一官半職，當地也沒有良好的法科學校，讓他們學習政治。</p>
<p>拿這種情形來和菲列賓對照一下看。從一九〇七年起，我們就舉行普選，來參加國民大會。一百二十名代表，全是菲列賓人，議長也是菲列賓人。從一九一六年起，菲列賓成立了自己的司法系統——犯法的人，不論是白種人或是褐種人，均由菲列賓警察加以逮捕，經菲列賓陪審官予以審判再經菲列賓法官判刑。道些人都曾在菲列賓大學和其他五所設有法科的大學裏學習過法政。</p>
<p>法屬之越南　啓蒙敎育未普遍</p>
<p>在越南，經過了六七十年法國人的啓蒙統治之後，那些未經啓蒙的農民仍舊是生活在同樣的黑曙之中。麻　，營養不良，　疾，對於他們仍舊是絕對神秘的病症，因爲免費的醫院和巡迴護士是如此稀少，也沒有强制的預防注射。敎育是不容易受到的，因爲那種漂亮的簇新的學校，只有大城市裏才有。要是一個農夫竟能獲得一個奇蹟似的機會，把他的兒子送到城市學校裏去，他至多也只能盼望他的兒子成爲一個庸庸碌碌的小職員而已，因爲在越南文官考試制度是不存在的，而國內一切銀行，鐵路商行裏的高級職位又都是留給法國人的。</p>
<p>英屬馬來的識字敎育，較爪哇更不如。一九四〇年，因當地物產豐饒，政府稅收激增，除解繳倫敦英國政府一千萬元（英幣）並支付一切費用外，尙餘二千零五十萬元（英幣）之多。可是該年份的敎育經費尙不足二百萬元（英幣）—僅及全部稅收的百分之一又四分之三。一九三八年時當地有五十八個學生在高級中學讀農科。同年份，在菲列賓却有四千六百名農科學生和九千名商科學生。</p>
<p>緬甸原始性　與六十年前無異</p>
<p>現代緬甸人的原始狀態和六十年前英國併吞緬甸時完全一樣。緬甸的礦藏是極豐富的，可是簡直沒有碰過。人民百分之八十五是務農的，只有一所高級中學敎授科學耕種。一九四〇年時，有一個緬甸人組織的政黨，主張修改憲法，並採取『每人應有兩英畝田和一頭牛」的政綢，牠的領袖們馬上就被抓到監獄裏去了。</p>
<p>自然，這些馬來人要將他們在菲列賓所見的情形，和他們自己的這際來作一個對照的。他們知這，在菲列賓有二百萬個兒童進學校，那兒以識字人數現在是百分之五十一。他們知道美國獲得菲列賓後的第一項措施，就是從美國派遺一千名敎員到菲列賓去開學校，開始訓練本地敎師。他們或許不知道，在此後四十二年間，那些菲列賓敎師已經增加至四萬名，分配到一萬一千所學校裏敎書；還有五千所公共圖書館，備書四百萬册以上，任何人都可閱讀。在戰前三年間，敎育經費占國家預算百分之三十三至三十七不等。</p>
<p>菲列賓有幾十個衛生實騐區，專事抵制瘧疾，强迫注射預防針；有一千五百餘所藥房，四十五所公立醫院，還有幾十所產科醫院和兒童醫院，均附授衛生營　等科目。農業試騐區每月出版公報，發表關於種植甘蔗，米，椰子，菠蘿蜜等的新方法。</p>
<p>不，緬甸，馬來亞，越南，爪哇，蘇門答臘，對於自治尙無相當的準備。</p>
<p>人類新路徑　創造新型太平洋</p>
<p>我們不能希望『自由」自己產生，幾百萬人民決不會突然得到解放，而讓他們來實騐自治。首先，他們必須按照預定程序來學習行政，由地方政府而省政府而中央政府。在過渡時期，應如美國在菲列賓設置高級專員的例子，特設一個督導團來督導外交事宜。</p>
<p>可是這種督導制是決不能演變爲某一歐洲國家單獨代管制的命不論是英國，荷蘭，法國，倘想單獨代管，必致遭遇遠東怒濤的冲擊。但倘有美蘇中三國參加督導團，且有同等的發言權，那末，這種怒濤就會消弭於無形。別國的發言權是這次戰爭的自然而公正的後果。</p>
<p>太平洋問題，在本質上，原是個全世界的種族問題。這個種族問題，是不容恝置，不容躱避，不容怱視的，否則下一次戰爭就將是個種族戰爭。要爲太平洋造成一個新的形式，我們不要走荷蘭的路，也不要走英國的路，我們要走人類的路。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>新生活可以改變政風</h3>
<p>上海市新生活運動促進會這幾天正舉辦新運週，錢市長和各機關首長社會名流，先後播講，大聲疾呼，節的淸潔等事也都在積極推行。這是最近可以使人樂觀興奮的消息，也是上海社會在勝利以後進於光明的氣象。不過我們希望　一遝動不僅止於報上的消息，尤其希望這氣象要永遠光明。</p>
<p>我們看到上海市新運會的幹事，不是政府的長官，就是黨部團部的領導者，一點也不奇怪，而且覺得應該如此。因爲錢市長說得好，新生活運動就是改造社會風氣的運動。在中國，一切改造風氣的事，其成功往往有一個原則，就是「上行下效」。原來必俟「下效」而後，風氣始成；而「下效」之條件首在「上行」。「上行」的兩個字中，更須着重在「行」的一個字。新運幹事旣然都由在「上」的人當仁不讓，自任其勞，那末只怕他們不「行」，不眞正的「行」，不努力的「行」，否則他們「力行」的結果，在「下」的社會羣衆一定會感動奮發，仿效起來的。古人早已說過：「爲政不在多言，顧在力行何如耳」。新生活之是否止於報上的消息，新生活之光明氣象是否能保持悠久，全看一般幹事首長「力行」的程度如何以爲斷。</p>
<p>新生活運動提倡了好多年，渙汗大號，幾已聲嘶力竭，而今天社會風氣何以尙有待於我們的改造？這緣故値得我們深長考究。尤其在上海，經過了暗無天日的八年歲月，妖魔鬼怪，都蒙了人面，憧憧往來。一旦光復，餘毒未必全淸。這濃厚的陰霧，更須待强烈的陽光來掃除。在這個時候，我們格外盼望新生活運動能有實效。目前上海最要不得的社會風氣，第一是奢侈，第二是虛偽，第三是拖延，其他姑不再舉。這三大病，小之足以喪身敗家，大之足以亡國滅種。新運是主張樸素的，可以醫奢侈；主張確實的，可以醫虛偽；主張迅速的，可以醫拖延。以往妖魔鬼怪所遺下來的毒素，只有「力行」新生活，纔能藥到病除，—但須注意，不要忽略了「力行」！</p>
<p>然而，與其希望新運馬上可以改造目前上海的社會風氣，不如先希望新運能够改變一般的政風。這裏所謂政風，不一定指那個機關，那些衙門，更不單說上海，乃是時下流行於官塲的風氣。目前官塲的風氣，的確需要新生活這服良藥，苦苦的吃下去，才有辦法挽救！</p>
<p>第一，中國是一個窮國，尤其在戰後，滿目瘡痍，政費更苦不給。公務員生活費年來本己追不上物價，天天在叫窮愁苦。可是近來的官塲，酬酢迎送，幾已目不暇接，酒食宴會，動耗百十萬金，眞所謂朱門酒肉臭，路有餓死骨。不但都市如此，甚至內地城鎭亦復相率效尤。充其窮奢極侈之所至，使只恃薪水收入的人，相形見絀，其將作何感想？更將何以爲生？如果在「上」的人，不立刻以身作則，力行節的，用樸素的新生活來糾正這頹風，吏治是無法希望淸明的。</p>
<p>其次，年來官塲辦事，大率講求敷衍而不辨是非；推諉責任而忽視效率。於是同一樣事，往往甲請遭駁，而乙請可准；同一法規，往往今天解釋如此，而明天引用如彼。又或設施計劃，不從大處落墨，少替人民設想，而但求朝發一令，夕布一政，鷄零狗碎，點綴裝潢，似已盡其能事。甚至接收只貼封條，而不問其停頓；發封只看前門，而不顧其後戶。若經申訴，則某部諉爲非其所轄，某局答稱未有所聞，責任誰屬，糾纏不淸，遷延歲月，徒喚奈何。究其癥結所在，無非「虛偽」「拖延」兩大病根在那裹作祟。我們要希望政治一天一天的修明起來，不能不仰望於各機關的首長力矯從前官僚政治留下來的腐敗習氣，切實負責，速決速行。</p>
<p>一切政令，都是由上而下。以身敎者從，以言敎者訟。姑無論新生活不能僅僅看做功令，就算是功令，也該從上面先切實推行起來。因此，我們敢說：改造社會風氣固然需要力行新生活，而改變政風尤其需要新生活！</p>

<p>烚赤昨漸趨堅定，業中頗多脫金進鈔者，以致市祝雖較前日好轉，但較之美鈔尙覺遜色，晨開微升爲七八萬，此後即因大戶紛購，逐步盤升至八〇萬大關，午刻雖因浮多了結　盤旋於七九萬左右，但午後仍形穩健，在七九萬五左右盤旋，結果較前收回好二萬二，報載赤金備蓄券可以在滬兌付，一般心理，揣測黃金亦將同時掛牌，銀行方面頗有吸納，趨勢繼續盤好，銀樓飾金掛八萬五，紋銀六百元，銀元站定於四百五六十元，暗拆去路尙活，息價約一角左右，年關在即，業中有定明日起休息至新正四日開市之說。</p>
<p>美鈔因陪都市價迫近一五〇〇元，開後即自一三二〇元步趨上漲，金證兩幫中人對黃金興趣繼續黯淡，紛紛華靑於美鈔，脫金購鈔者紛至沓來，午後更甚，結果以高價收市，較前收漲起六十元，港票初時極爲平定，午刻尙與前收相彷徘，午後突起買風，傳聞新貨在彼處有對折之價，海空兩路輸遝者紛紛，供過於求下，漲起十元，結果較前收老貨好十五元，新貨漲十元。</p>
<p>公債因游資轉向美鈔，市况遂呈平庸，初穩繼疲，徘徊而已，結果較之前收計甲乙尙平，丙種跌三十元，丁種跌十元，戊種跌二十元。</p>
<p>華股受金鈔刺激，散戶稍感興奮，以致市况由疲趨俏，一般游資逐漸垂靑於冷門各股，各擇其價廉者搜羅，結果各股均普遍向榮，較之前收計永紗漲二十五元，美亞五元，新光五角，景福一元半，勤興二元半，各股間差價漸有軋攏趨勢。</p>
<p>外股亦隨人心好轉而微挺，結果較前收計怡紗回升一百八十元，啤酒好三十元，紙業五元，尙是買價，此外冷門各股則以求供關係而榮辱互見。</p>
<h3>紗銷絡繹不斷　細貨已供不敷求</h3>
<p>昨日紗市穩定逾恒，人心雖不作高漲之奢望，然客銷陸續不斷，香港輪船已有開航，粵幫散戶對重磅特雙馬頗有吸收，廠價售見六十四萬，保交現貨，普通二十支紗榮厚互見，而去化不多，本埠棉織廠及布廠對細紗及雙錢需求仍殷，致價極堅挺，緣細貨存底已薄，一經搜求，乃呈供不敷求之勢。</p>
<h3>呢絨交易清寂</h3>
<p>呢絨昨市依然繼續下降，但仍少實地受主，同時塞出者甚衆，造成江河日下之勢，蓋其第一銷戶西服裁縫帮，門市現定生意均頗淸寂，聞南京杭州各埠亦然，因此預測在舊曆年底以內，呢絨營業恐難得轉機云。</p>
<h3>桂圓行盤回緊</h3>
<p>桂圓因來源較多，市價步跌，前後降度已逾半數泉大泡曾到二萬五千元，興化元亦進三萬元大關，客方因後辦之貨成本反高，無不虧耗，乃相戒扳守不出，趨勢漸見好轉，昨北市號家開出二百餘件，回升一千五百元，行盤因之隨緊。</p>
<p>新圓肉昨有小數開出，包澤片張均在標準之例，而身份亦干，價爲七萬元，其他普通貨則不及四萬元云。</p>
<h3>玻璃暢銷</h3>
<p>戰時狀態業已過去，復興工作正在開始，至於小部分之修理，更是所在都有，尤以窗戶之修理爲最急，因此玻璃之銷路旺盛，其價格亦隨之扶搖直上，如薄玻璃頭子，在四十寸及五十寸者，每箱均售二萬元，在六十寸左右者，二萬二千元，又如厚玻璃五十杭子四十成中等尺寸者，售二萬三千元云。</p>
<h3>南來源多　米糧漸露疲勢　麵粉荳油微漲</h3>
<p>米市南幫來源甚多，店胃淸淡，價回疲一二百元，白元陰元亦因貨多，價小三四百元，油市豆油略疲，生汕帶堅，麪粉雖續昂百餘元，但南北洋消化轉懈，形勢轉呆，黃豆亦以泉州興化進胃淡而回小三四百元，生仁挺秀，芝蔴貨少，到不敵消，價升千餘元，棉餅平平，豆餅乏交未開，酒市走銷甚活，續漲五百元。</p>
<h3>台省禁糖出口　欲以食糖換肥料</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿六日電〕自台省長官公署禁止私運食糖出口後，各方甚爲注意，頃據陳長官語記者，台灣素以農產著稱之糧食，若糖等項，因年來交通停頓，肥料不足，致產額銳减，若不力謀糧食之增產，則不僅無力接濟內地各省今後之需要，即台省境內之供應，亦將頓感失調，故目前台省糧食增產，端賴肥料之輸入，爲謀肥料之獲得，必須集中僅存之食糖，以資交換，故除與有關方面竭力設法，向海外輸入大宗化學原料外，爲普遍獎勵一般肥料之供應起見，所有任何方面或任何商人運載硫酸亞或大豆餅到台者，均可向台省省貿易公司換取食糖出省。</p>

<h3>燃料市況堅穩　白煤篩塊續漲</h3>
<p>煤市大致平穩，無甚軒輊，唯白煤篩塊及時需用，買風旺盛，行情冉冉向上，柴炭碼頭到貨，最近較前爲少，同業存棧尙充足，但碼頭交貨與棧房交貨，需加車力行扣等費用一二百元，致市價遂見堅挺。</p>

<h3>晨友杯籃球賽　今日甲組二塲　東華戰汕隊　綠林對德勝</h3>
<p>晨友盃甲組，今日下午五時半起，循例二場，雖未見如何精彩，但其中以東華與汕隊之役，均屬富有吸引之隊伍，中靑當局鑒於此點，有提高門票之說。</p>
<p>今戰首塲爲綠林對德勝，前者以健將陳正森受傷，减少攻勢，雖有生力軍后學詩助陣，終屬得不償失，德勝際此良機，如能全體戎裝，殊有獲勝可能。</p>
<p>東華與汕隊，後者戰績駕東華而上之，唯以兩隊之作風相同，則以毒攻毒，廝殺必烈，果爲大有可觀之一幕。今日秩序如次：</p>
<p>綠林—德勝（甲組）五時半</p>

<h3>爲兒童敎育呼籲</h3>
<p>— 陸殿揚</p>
<p>抗戰以後，大後方的敎科書多用各地土產紙張印刷，紙質組劣，印刷模糊，便是初小一年級的課本，字體雖然很大，筆畫還是不淸楚，圖畫尤不美觀，甚至不能認識，更談不上欣賞，後方的兒童在菜油燈下讀土紙書，幾年以後，眼睛受到很大的損害。航空委員會招考新生，靑年目力不及格的很多，對於國家的犧牲多麼重大！</p>
<p>現在戰事已勝利結束，而後方的小學仍在應用土紙印的課本，這是很不合理的事。固然因爲交通尙未恢復，報紙尙未運到後方，本學期小學不得不仍用土紙課本，但是下學期怎樣呢？我恐怕下學期後方的兒童還不能享受白報紙印的課本吧！我們不能不爲後方的兒童敎育呼　？請救救大後方的兒童，江運噸位快減少一些香烟和化妝品的運輸，而改裝白報紙到渝，專作印刷小學課本之用。</p>
<p>至於東南收復區呢，向來是用白報紙印敎科書，兒童從來沒有看見過土紙課本，似乎是不成問題了。但是經過一番調查之後，才知收復區內敎科書也是供不應求，於是有的小學仍舊沿用敵偽課本，有的小學混用戰前敎材或補充敎材，都不適合於新中國的兒童敎育，而專備供應國定敎科書的七聯處却苦於得不到充分的報紙以印刷課本。聽說上海封存的倉庫裏有很多的報紙，分發各報館各雜誌社應用，獨七聯處尙未領到過這種報紙。據云他們印國定課本用的紙張都是用重價向黑市購買的，這無疑要影響到印書的數量和時期。况且書商成本增高，書價不能減低，又要加重兒童的負担。本學期如此，下學期怎樣呢？我恐怕手臂長的很多，下學期收復區的兒童說不定還不能享受官價白報紙的課本，我們不能不爲收復區的兒童敎育呼籲：請救救收復區的兒童，不要忘記了他們，不要讓他們再讀敵偽課本。倉庫裏封存的報紙，應該儘先分配於印刷國定敎科書的各出版家，限於印刷國定小學課本，定期出書，減輕售價。聽說過去敵偽印刷敎科書，曾優先「配給」報紙，難道現在的當局沒有敵偽這樣重視兒童敎育嗎？我想決不會的。</p>
<p>據云上海報紙存底並不很多，而敎科書的需要量極大，所以治本的方法，我們以爲政府應該帮助各出版家向國外大量訂購報紙，給予官價外匯，减輕進口關稅，核准優先運輸，然後分配各區，印刷小學課本（小學課本印數有定，照預定印數分配紙張，不致有弊）。這樣，敎科書價可以大大减輕，對於推行國民敎育，一定可以收到相當的功効，國家似乎値得做這一件有關兒童敎育的工作。</p>
<p>誰無兒童，誰不希望兒童得到精美淸楚面又廉價的課木？筆者這個小小的建議，一定可以得到有關方面人士的同情和贊助，而於最短期內實現。</p>

<h3>英商保險公司聲明　對保戶負責範圍　規定適用於敵軍佔領區佔領期間之契約待考慮</h3>
<p>英新聞處本市訊：英國保險公司業已公布聲明，對戰時敵人佔領區內被保險者之處置辦法有所闡述。上海方面，業已接獲此項聲明，其原則有下列數項：</p>
<p>（一）所謂「敵軍佔領區」，係指從未與英國處於作戰狀態，惟因根據「對敵通商法」而頒之法令指爲敵區，或雖無此種命令之頒布，惟確在敵軍佔領下之區域而言。</p>
<p>（二）所謂「技術上的敵人」，係指居住於敵軍佔領區內之任何個人或團體（不論其爲法人或非法人）而言。上述聲明，僅就火險，海險，航空險及一般保險而言。</p>
<p>至於保險契約除受下列各項規定限制外，即令其當事人係「技術上的敵人」，仍不認其契約業已解除。</p>
<p>第一，倘所保險者係貨物，則此項貨物必須未曾運往與聯合王國或其盟國處於敵對地位之任何政府個人或公司，在運送之任何時間內，亦未曾變爲上述政府，個人或公司之財產。</p>
<p>第二，凡遭聯合王國政府或任何盟國政府之捕獲，拘禁，限制，或扣留而引起之損失或法律上主張，均將不認爲在保險範圍之內。</p>
<p>第三，倘此項保險已轉移至另一保險公司，則自轉移之日起，英國保險公司即卸除其責任。</p>
<p>第四，常敵人佔領期間，在聯合王國簽訂之協議，仍將認爲有效。至於在佔領區內，在佔領期間締結之新契約之法律上地位，公司方面則將予以審愼之考慮。</p>
<h3>南京路上人力車　今午恢復通行</h3>
<p>本市市政府，前因鑒於南京路爲市區交通要道，車輛行駛甚多，爲避免危險起見，乃決定除汽車電車外，其他車輛一律禁止通行。惟實施以來，對南京路各商店之營業，不無影響。近經潘公展，奚玉書兩氏建議，市府已予採納，准自今日開始，每日下午二時起至午夜止，所有三輪車，自由車，人力車一律通行，已飭所屬各機關遵照辦理。</p>
<h3>程監察使關心民瘼　建議軍隊應勿逕人民居速籌地方財政根本辦法</h3>
<p>江蘇區監察使署於本月中旬，委派調查員多名，分赴江南各區視察。據分別報告，京滬沿綫各縣，住來軍隊，大都佔住民房借用廚灶，雖紀律尙能整飭，然閭閻不免騷擾。程監察使以此種情形，誠恐影嚮民衆對於國軍之敬仰，急宜改善，以維軍民感情，特向江穌省政府及第三方面軍司令部建議，嗣後關於軍隊駐屋，勿論久暫，應由縣政府督同地方負責人員，代爲招尋。至於軍隊需用各物，亦應縣政府指定機關代辦，軍隊到境，　向縣政府接洽，萬勿逕入民居，藉免紛擾。又監察使署近據調查，蘇省治安會議決定之分區綏靖辦法，如修築公路，架設電話，恢復橋梁，建立碉堡，編組保甲，調查戶口等應需材料及各項經費，均　。地方籌墊軍糧補給，在兵站未運到前，亦令地方代購。至行政人員辦公旅費，更屬毫無着落，程監察使以蘇省各縣地方收復以來，人民負擔，日益加重，且漫無限制，上項縱靖經費，名爲地方　　，　即人民負擔，特向國防最高委員會建議，地方用款，在未經呈　以前幸勿輕令地方籌　，並請中央體念民隱，對地方財政，於下年度速奪根本辦法，以蘇民　而奠地方行政基礎。</p>
<h3>夏威夷版美金票　不得貶値</h3>
<p>夏威夷版美金票，在本市流通頗廣，乃錢舖有意抑低其價　，竟較普通美金票減少兌價百分之二。事爲富地美軍財政處所聞，昨特發出通告，聲明此種夏威夷版美金票，與其他美金票同一價値，苟有故貶其値者，美軍民切不可與之交易。</p>
<h3>電費增價　在考慮中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃向各關係方面探悉：本市電費之增價問題，刻尙在考慮之中。上海電力公司雖會於本月初向市公用局提出調斃電價之請，惟以電政現由經濟部主管，故一切電政措施，尙有待全面之商討，俾便作合理調整，目前上海電力公司爲應付發電關係，每日需用煤七百噸，油料約三百五十噸，以目前燃料價格之高昂，及來源之困難，成本浩大，故公司收支，勢難相抵，當局爲顧全事實計，調整常屬可能，據聞：常局之意，對普通小額用戶，舊限十度以內，每度十二元之電價規定，擬暫維原狀，而對佔全市用電量百分之七八十之工業及一般電熱用電或將酌予調整，以資挹注。又據傳：公司方面在復業初期，平均發電一度，需煤四磅。茲者以機器修理日有進步，發電一度所需之煤，亦已減至三磅弱，故如燃料供應好轉，電價調整之數，或可望不致過鉅。又該公司自本月份起，實施追加保證金，收費多寡，係根據各戶之用電量爲標準，大致等於過去一月問帳單所開電費額再加五成之數，聞此次追加保證金之目的，在使用戶保證如期淸付賬單，而公司方面自抄表寄帳單乃至用戶持單於限期前付淸所欠電費，前後需時一月有半，故追加保證金乃有照上月用電費加五成收費之規定也。</p>
<h3>電車公司工潮　尙待磋商</h3>
<p>（本報訊）英商電車公司司機。　票，撬路暨機務部全體工友，要求公司改善待　，增加工資。前日工友代表三十一人曾集會　討具體辦法，擬向公司當局提　　請求，唯其內容因各代表尙　審愼研討，故請求書尙未送交公司，社會局亦未接獲任何通知。據悉：工友要求最低之底薪，　　遵照社會局所規定之最低標　每月二十六元，而目下工友底　最低者僅十元許，相差一倍有半，是故尙有待於磋商。又悉：前被公司集體解僱之查　　　　五人，經社會局秉公調停，已圓滿解決。</p>
<p>兩烟公司復工有望</p>

<h3>「月光曲」及音樂的欣賞</h3>
<p>— 宋壽昌</p>
<p>藝術品中，如繪畫，雕刻都有形體存在空間，可以用視覺或觸覺來欣賞，從線條，形體，色彩，構圖上作種種的比較，使內心發生一種共嗚，音樂卻不是這樣，構成的材料祇是廣漠空泛的音，巧妙地連接面成，表現思想感情來得育由而直接，不受客觀的專象的約束，所以音樂便成衛種不可捉摸　的藝術。這種藝術的特殊的抽象性，在一切藝術中，是音樂所獨具的。</p>
<p>音樂中也有模寫自然音的，用客觀的事象的描寫，究竟趣味低級。所以有客觀加主觀的描寫「標題音樂。」更進步的，有以純主觀而描寫的，如心理的描官，劇的描寫，都可以這種作品，有所謂「交響詩」「音詩」「音樂劇」等，都是作者的帛象的內心的表出。我們要領略音的內容，那未應該馮着自己的感情和主觀去想像了。</p>
<p>譬如拿世界上最　炙人口的一首「月光曲」來講罷，這樂典原是斐多芬為獻給他的愛人球麗哀備（Guilette）而用，肉容是描寫熱戀的煩惱的幼想，出版者為引起一般人對于音樂的興趣，故意楪題這樂典為「月光」。並為說明樂典的內容起見，造出一個故事來，說裴多芬某天的晚上，散步郊外，有一個盲目的農村女子，正在月光的窗下彈奏披雅娜，裴多芬便把月光下的情景描寫出來，而彈出此曲。我們受了這標題的暗示，總月光曲的時候，便似乎幢璟在月光之下了。</p>
<p>月光曲的第一樂章，是徐緩的，朦朧的情趣，好像月光的初升；第二樂章是輕快的，暗示着淸朗，如浩月的懸於太空；最後的樂章是急速的，激烈的，猶如午夜的狂颷。出版業把它標題爲「月光」，似乎勉强可以符合樂曲內容的。可是俄羅斯近代大音樂家羅平斯坦（Rubinstein）對于月光曲就指摘標題的不當。他以爲表現月光應該是朦朧的，夢想的，平和的，溫靜的，才會符合。月光曲的第一樂韋却完全是悲哀的·最後的樂章是在暴的熱情的·則與月光的平和溫靜的情趣相反。</p>
<p>關於月光曲，又有說是從左伊美的拙劣的詩「祈禱的處女」受得暗示而作。采爾尼（Czerny）曾把月光曲聽作幽靈出現的夜曲。可爾耐柳斯（Cornelius）曾把月光曲聽作哥失克（Gohic）敎會的描寫。這種種的聯想，都未始不可。因爲音樂旣是作者的抽象的內心的表出，我們聽音樂的時候，如何的感想，所聯想的是什麼，那是各人的自由。</p>
<h3>高爾基的「夜店」</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>柯靈師陀改譯的高爾基一夜店」，已由佐臨導演，在辣斐大戲院演出好幾天了。這是繼「大馬戲團」以後的一本好戲，金不換和慕容天錫一樣的沒有出息，仍舊由石揮主演。史原仍舊演一個嘻嘻哈哈愛說俏皮話的角色。（我想也許是在「秋海棠」裏）林榛的戲，我記得在一本影射袁世凱的戲裏看過，我深刻地印着她在台上與另外一個胖女人打架。張伐大約還是與「大馬戲團」一樣，演小生主角。蘇琴似乎在「八仙外傳」裏見過。總之，台上所看到的，幾乎全是熟人。我離開上海兩年了，回來還看見苦幹劇社幹下去，這精神眞可佩服。訊得過去幾年間，我寫過好幾十篇劇評，大部分用鄒嘯這一筆名在申報遊藝界上刋登。因爲我取的是欣賞的態度，多說好話，多鼓勵，不大指責，因此被人譏爲「四平八穩的劇評」。不過我得聲明，我是一個老實人，凡我所說的話，無一不是從心坎裏出來的，我說了我所要說的話。「夜店」是我回滬後所看的第一個話劇，我現在又寫似是而非的劇評了。</p>
<p>丹尼在「蛻變」裏演丁大夫，我曾經替她喝過采。她的戲感動得我流淚，我希望能採取一節編入國語敎科書。這一次我替她躭心。這樣溫良的母性怎麼能演歇士底里的女人呢？結果竟出於我的意外，她成功了。自然，她所表現的動作，利用圍巾迅速的裏緊與撒開，使我憶起銀幕上的「嘉爾曼」（法國梅麗美作），彷彿是一個西班牙熱情的女人；又使我想起「莎樂美」（英國王爾德作），總覺得有點外國味道。但中國這一類型的女人究竟是怎樣的動作，我也沒有見過，說不上來。</p>
<p>有一處地方我覺得導演得很好。就是阿滿將死，全老頭同她叙說天堂之樂，說有運　接引；這時阿滿便扶着全老頭的手杖，彷彿眞的已被接引上天，這個暗示加强了我的意象。這手杖已經代替了　膠，這樣的處理是很聰明的。</p>
<p>師陀的獻詞上提起賽觀音，言下似乎以爲她是一個可憐的人，還要我們回答：「她爲什麼這樣殘酷？」我想，他要我們回答的是他自己的話：「社會的力量更大，他們更深的被摔下去。」但賽觀音以前的生活我們不知道，比方說，她是否被聞太師騙娶或强買來的，我們都不淸楚，因此對於她也只有厭惡，沒有同情。當然，聞太師是最使人討厭的。可是對於賽觀音，我總看不出她的悲哀，除了失戀的痛苦和因比成爲神經質以外。我的意思是，應該把她的過去設法追叙幾句。我最喜歡的是全老頭，他有博愛的心腸，熱心救人；明知有些事是迷信或靠不住，也不願打破人家的美夢，反而附和着說，蘇琴演得也到家。「大馬戲團」裏也有這末一個說預言的先知，（徐志摩的「卞　岡」裏也有）但沒有全老頭可愛。</p>
<p>師陀柯靈的改譯，中國味兒很够。譬如說，打脾九最忌後面有人看書，因爲書與輸同音，這是中國人的一種「太步」（禁忌）。</p>
<p>劇中有一段吹腔販馬記哭監，高笑鷗唱「滿腹含冤」，表情甚好，能够表達痛苦之狀，但唱腔似少蒼凉之致。</p>
<h3>短簡</h3>
<p>— 藍天</p>
<p>戲塲歸來</p>
<p>從熱氣騰騰的戲院子裏出來，不免有點頭昏。幾千個人沉醉在現代化的「聲」「色」之中，忘掉了屋外的冷氣了，這種電影，當時給觀衆的印象是無比的熱鬧，過後一想，又是空無所有，眞是絢爛之極，終趨平淡。</p>
<p>走在如絲的細雨之下，無限茫然。</p>
<p>佇立電車站上，放眼縱看十字路口的人來人往，匆匆地來，匆匆地往，自何處來？往何處去？雖然那條馬路並不太冷落，但是街燈黯淡，不免凄凉得很。遠遠地車子來了，心裏存着一點希望。可是車廂裏的乘客擠極了，看着令人奇怪，那末小的車子竟然奘得下如許的人？原來預備再候下一輛車子來，轉念一想，還不是一樣的的擠嗎？何况擠在人堆之中，也能略爲驅除一點泛濫着的寂寞之感。（你想，我是如何的可憐呀！）</p>
<p>回到家中，房問裏凌亂得很，這些東西，彷彿是如曾相識，轉眼又覺遼遠得很，我一樣樣地收拾起來，動作會突然地停止，我神往於不久前的這間屋子裏的情形。外邊下着雨，想起你，還要跑兩個地方，心裏邊不安得很。</p>
<p>最近李義出的詩句似乎很時髦。這兒，那兒都見到它，剛才半路上我也怱地想起兩句：「紅樓隔雨相望冷，珠箔飄　獨自歸』，很切合環境。其實底下兩句也好，祇是情調太凄凉一點，他說：「遠路應悲春晼晚，殘宵猶憶夢依稀」。多看這些，把自己的感情培養得更織巧了。是不？</p>
<h3>我歌頌江南</h3>
<p>— 登臨</p>
<p>江南，這水鄕明麗的江南，曾鈎起了人們多少的緬懷！多少的綣　？</p>
<p>江南替我留下了穠華的春夢，江南也替我留下了不滅的浪跡，在我有生命的記憶裏，江南是給了我幾許的惆悵！</p>
<p>我記起我曾在宏偉的海濱前眺望過，那廣瀚的海水澎湃）的波濤，它是多麼的雄浩，有時，黃昏的斜陽撒下了滿天的晚霞，半山裏閃爍着紫翠的彩色，柔雲飄浮過山岫，從那兒兜住了映射的絢爛的彩霞，又載着它渡向飄渺的虛空，渡向廣漠的長水；在天的際　，遺下了它最後的生命，遠了去了。祇是那茫茫的海水，還是那末默然地湃進；從太古到現在，從高山到平原，永遠是這末無聲息地，無聲息地，藏着滿懷的壯志，渡那悠悠的長夜，雖然那僅有的一霎的光明已撇下了它去了！</p>
<p>我記起我曾在明燈的綠幃下瞻望過。星爛月明的夜晚，和着友伴　們天地幻想着未來。窗前冷艷的蕙閙吐着淸幽的馨香，如今消逝到那兒去了？有時，寂寞的柳巷中飄來了隱然的簫聲，是那末的鬱迴悲切，許是有人在憧憬生命的鑄塑？夜深了，皓月的淸光下，杜鵑奏着撩人的思鄉曲，似在召喚遠地的遊子，「不如歸去！」「不如歸去！」</p>
<p>我也曾記起小丘上古蒼的虬松，如荼楓葉，是那末的蔥翠艷麗。多少人在這裏徘徊過，多少人在進裏微笑過，刧後的風光該不再是如此的綺麗吧！或許披刈荒榛己替代了它昔日的勞華。八年，八年的摧殘已埋下了無數的血淚，八年的摧殘也添增了無數的憑弔！</p>
<p>我更記起了樓頭的溪水，堤邊的　塘……。聽洶湧怒　，　海的潮汐該依然是宇宙間的壯觀</p>
<p>車身轆轆地向前疾進，大江南綫重又在眼底劃現。遼闊的天宇，高聳的青山……。它依舊是年輕的，祗是帶上了些須過度的　疲吧了！</p>
<p>祖國的田野在前面顯現了。陽光照耀着前程，江　在它的光輝開始了新生。</p>
<h3>塞外江南（和）</h3>
<p>— 顧一樵</p>
<p>美玉早濡涵，無意尋探，南山白雪積層嵐，雪水抽絲絲潔白，遍地桑　。上下古今譚，對影成三，平沙淡月夢初酣，爲夢江南尋塞外，塞外江南。</p>
<h3>溫暖的獲得</h3>
<p>— 吳依仁</p>
<p>當西北風襲擊着這全已裏在身上所做有底寒衣時，周身頓是失去了暖意，似乎，這顆心也在那里冰了，這時，你是怎樣地渴望着有所溫暖的所在，能爲你恢復所失去的暖意，使你快將冰凍的心復活起來呀！但是，這種希望你想錯了，那些享受着溫暖的人們，他們決不會想到你們那些失去暖意的痛苦，因爲，他們自身不曾嘗過失去溫暖的滋味，那更不會懂得那些苦痛了，即使知道，也還是極微的感觸，於是你所希望的「同情」將永遠地希望下去。</p>
<p>朋友！等待他人的同情是不可靠的，一切都得靠你自己，必須自已努力，爲求得周身的溫暖，爲復活爲凍冷的心，你祗有拚命的奔跑，拼命使你的周身活動，然後，你的血液才會奔流於全身之間，甚至，你的毛孔中溢出汗珠來，這時，你所期待着的「溫暖」就來了，那是用自己的力　所得來的溫暖，它不會逃走，將永遠是你自己所有。</p>
<p>假使，在常你希望人們來同情你的時候，幸運地被一個同情者引到溫暖的所在去了，遂之你周身中增加了溫暖，可是試問，你能永遠的留在那裏嗎？，即使不能的話，那這溫暖還是暫時的仍將失去，當你離開的時候。</p>
<p>朋友！「求人不如求己」這是句古人的老話：惟一的溫暖還是用自己所具備的馬達中去打出來吧。</p>
<p>祗有寒冷才能鼓起你奔跑的勇氣，</p>
<p>惟有艱難才會加强你奮鬥的精神。</p>

<h3>圖畫的故事</h3>
<p>— 慕容隨</p>
<p>說短不短也大的有七八個年頭吧！我在曾當着小學敎員，雖然歲月悠悠，却也並不寂寞，覺得也有很多的「故事」，是値得回憶的。</p>
<p>我並不說謊，也曾兼任過　　敎師：記得有一天，我在講合的黑板上，畫了—原想是畫一隻虎的—一隻狗，就算牠是狗吧！敎幾十個拖着鼻涕的小學生在他們的畫薄上照樣「葫蘆」地畫。</p>
<p>可是結果呢！等到彙集課卷細細評閱。覺得這幾十本卷子上，畫得有些兒像狗的，只有寥寥的二三幅，其餘的呢！有些像牛，有些像豬，有些像兎子，有些像老鼠，有些像……凡是四隻脚的畜生，大槪都有份吧！</p>
<p>當時只覺得這些高足的大作，除了沒有一個「會逢其適」地像虎的以外，也總算是「洋洋大觀」，「嘆觀止矣」！</p>
<p>我開始知道天才的發展，是不應該加以拘囿的，而應談隨他們的「興趣」而發揮，下次我就這樣地出了「課題」，關照他們憑他們的意想所及，各自畫一隻四脚的畜生，隨便什麼畜生，只要是四隻脚的就行！</p>
<p>但是結果却眞出乎意想之外，幾十件「作品」，雖然都綴上四隻脚，但是一幅像畜生的都沒有。仔細看看，却有些像「桌子」，有些像「椅子」，—他算沒有忘記了畜生該有的尾巴—我當時不禁有點好笑！</p>
<p>如今想想，笑嗎？那未免有點殘酷，應該知道就是畫一隻畜生，也不是什麼容易的事啊？</p>

<p>先總理孫中山先生，奔走革命，辛亥秋冬間，曾任江蘇省代表，組織中華民國臨時政府，與十七省代表公舉中山先生爲中華民國第一任大總統，元年一日與林志超陳陶遺王亮　居覺生馬君武王儒堂吳鐵城等同志，及雷繼興谷鍾秀屈文六等諸先生，授大總統印與中山先生，時皆歡忻歌舞，意謂我中華民國將來必有極大希望。然不出二月，中山先生即讓位於袁項城，自此十餘年間，項城專政四年，軍閥竊柄十年，中山先生奮鬥四十年，革命未竟全功而逝世，洛深　爲老黨員之一，而未能有助於革命，我介石同志在十四年後，繼中山先生遺志，努力北伐，統一中華，此實爲我黨國之第一人也，今又血戰八年，將中華民國列入世界四大侵國之一，洛知先總理中山先生在天之靈，必將有以慰勞之，因作此圖目呈之。洛少時喜作山水畫，三十歲後奔走於敎育及政治工作，不　作此，擱筆者將達四十年，二十七年　避難居滬，儗與老同志陳陶遣兄西上參加抗敵工作，陶道告我曰：政府今日須廣羅各方人才，抗戰逎能有力，我等若去必將佔居一位置，則政府即少一安置人才之地位，不若居上海呂不降其志，不辱其身，爲渝陷區人士之表率，不愈於去重慶乎？乃相約不動，而家兄希濂亦同意此舉，然不出三年，資斧用罄，三人均鬶書以爲生，友人目洛少時能作畫，勸我豐畫，乃重理畫筆，三十二年秋始作畫，時以希馬拉耶爲我國最高山，亦爲世界最高山，具熱溫寒三帶氣候，中國畫家未有畫者，戲作數幅，以易柴米，當時思及蔣委員長介石同志抗日戰爭之辛勤，常作一畫於其成功還都之日贈之，目寓樓促小，且無大晝桌，不能作大幅，乃購三尺絹以備應用，及本歲五月，世界戰事將結束，預計中國政府不出三月將還都南京，乃在六月中旬著手工作，又以中國之大名山之多，若僅繪一希馬拉耶，朱免單調故改作此圖繪黃帝手植之柏，表示我國之民族系統也。繪昆俞爲我國諸山發脈之所在也，希馬最高亦昆侖之支脈，若以我黨國象徵言，則昆侖爲先總理中山先生，而希馬拉耶則蔣介石同志也，繪金剛山則以日本開始侵略我國也，爲朝鮮之爭奪，今日本戰敗，朝鮮得獨立，仍將爲我東藩也，繪五岳及其它諸山以表示中國之偉大，且象徵本屆抗日有功之各同志也，畫筆或師南宮，或宗北苑，或法馬遠，或仿香光，兼參以西歐水彩。圖成，由陳陶遺題字。又乙卯七夕由郁志甘君贈我一石，上緊瑪瑙琢成之劉海洒金錢飾物錢文曰：天下太平。是夕日本投降。因囑朱璠如君刻天下太平之寳鈐之圖。略識作圖之意，日另紙書於畫之上端。</p>

<h3>本市各影院　何以不准兒童入塲</h3>
<p>— 若宣</p>
<p>電影原爲市民正當娛樂之一，但本市各輪電影院爲杜絕兒童習於惡劣舉動起見，凡十齡以下之兒童均不招待，這個理由，總覺得十分勉張，假使說果爲防止兒童的習於惡劣舉動，那末難道十齡以上的兒意和成人看了之後就一定毫無影嚮嗎？况且當局已有電影審查委員會的設立，凡屬誨淫誨盜的不良影片，根本就可以禁止其開映，因噎廢食，決非辦法。同時最近在各院開映的中外影片以宣揚抗戰意識的敎育和戰事者爲多，兒意看了之後，不但無書，且可增進戰爭常識和使他們知道敵人過去是怎樣的殘暴無理，同時又使我們想到其他各國，也並無兒童進入影院的禁令，而他們那些兒童平時的惡劣舉動，也許還沒有我們的兒童爲多吧，爲此，希望當局立即下令各影院，撤消「兒童不准入場的」規定。</p>
<p>（編者按）電影院禁止兒童入院，不能說沒有理由，因爲幼小的兒童，往往在院內啼哭呌喊，妨碍觀衆的聽覺與公衆秩序，確是應該拒絕。我以爲應以入學年齡爲限，即六歲以下概不招待，而六足歲以上智識稍開的兒童，可以讓他增長新智識，希望當局與影院同業一商榷之。</p>

<h3>戒烟無憂論（三）</h3>

<p>吸食烟毒者，偶於所需之量不是或中止時，常發生如前述之禁斷現象，已使人痛苦難耐，終身受累，已不堪言喻。同時其身體與精神於不自覺之中，已日漸虧損，其最顯著者，爲胃腸消化　　發生　　，而　　慣性便閉，影響全身新陳代謝作用，以致營養不良，肌肉消瘦，終則靡然沉湎，形骸豺立，生殖器之機能亦早顯衰弱，男子則陽萎，女子則月經不調，性慾缺乏，生育困難，（其冶遊者藉烟毒之力量以壯陽，乃爲初吸烟之興奮作用，其後終歸無效。）神經系統與精神方面受害尤烈，能使精神活動能力薄次减低，日久發生種種性格上之變化，即情感生活日見狹縮，趣味减少，道德觀念日漸喪失，虛偽欺詐，不守信用，不知義理，雖犧牲地位名譽，亦所不惜。此種變態性格，完全係因中毒所致，不能自抑，亦不自覺也。更有發生精神亢奮，妄譫妄想，或中毒性精神病者。至於因病吸烟成癮者，其病勢雖暫時因麻醉作用而掩蔽，但所患之病，並未痊癒，因此病勢常於暗中日漸增重，一旦發作，烟毒之麻醉已失其靈騐。再欲求諸醫藥，已告不及，此亦吸食烟毒之害也。故余　將吸食烟毒用以興奮提神或治病，而維持其生命，以致身體日形虧損之理由，與舉債度日典質爲生相同。因其日久勢必窮困益甚，蓋自烟毒所得之精力，非生理上由飲食營養作用所發生之自然精力也。</p>

<h3>Government-Communist Negotiations Reopen, First Discussing Ceasefire Principles; Specifics to be Handled by the Political Consultative Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Government representatives and Communist representatives continued their talks from 5 PM on the 27th. The government side was represented by Chairman Zhang Qun, Minister Wang Shijie, and Secretary-General Shao Lizi. The Communist side was represented by Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying, and Wang Ruofei (Dong Biwu was absent due to other commitments). They exchanged opinions on matters related to the cessation of military conflict and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference for approximately two hours. Both sides displayed a strong desire for concrete solutions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] Government and Communist representatives held an informal meeting today to discuss arrangements for the upcoming Political Consultative Conference. This marks the first meeting since the KMT-CPC negotiations stalled on November 17th. Some Chinese newspapers suggest the Consultative Conference will not be held before January 10th, but this date has not been confirmed. The arrival of President Truman's special envoy, General Marshall, in Chongqing has heightened national interest in the upcoming Consultative Conference and the ongoing negotiations. Since arriving last Saturday, Marshall has met with representatives from the government, the Communist Party, and the Democratic League, gaining a good understanding of their respective positions. Marshall has indicated he is open to hearing from anyone. Chinese newspapers are publishing daily commentaries on Marshall, which are read aloud to him each morning by a translator. The *Shishi Xinbao* reported that Marshall loves flowers and received a bouquet from Madame Chiang Kai-shek yesterday. The lengthy articles published in the newspapers are clearly intended to catch Marshall's eye.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 27th] An Associated Press special correspondent reports: The hope for peace in China has suddenly intensified today as the KMT-CPC unity negotiations, which had been stalled for 40 days, have resumed. It is widely believed that this is largely due to General Marshall's initial activities in Chongqing. The KMT and CPC negotiators met at 5 PM and agreed that a ceasefire would be the first item on the agenda. The Communist side formally submitted a written proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Political figures hope that general ceasefire principles can be agreed upon, with the other specifics being handled by the Political Consultative Conference, currently scheduled to be held in January. The participation of Communist Chief of General Staff General Ye Jianying has strengthened public confidence in the negotiations. Other Communist representatives at the roundtable include Communist Deputy Chairman Zhou Enlai, Political Consultative Conference delegate Dong Biwu, and Wang Ruofei. The Nationalist Party is represented by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Sichuan Province Chairman Zhang Qun, and National Political Council Secretary Shao Lizi.</p>
<p>Marshall's First Report Asserts China Situation is Hopeful</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th, Associated Press] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told the press today: "Marshal Marshall is constantly in contact with the State Department, reporting on his activities. The situation in China is hopeful. Marshall is meeting with various Chinese leaders."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today: Based on the first report received from Marshal Marshall, he believes the situation in China is hopeful. Acheson made this statement in response to a reporter's question regarding whether the State Department had received a report on Marshall's work in China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 27th] General Marshall is gathering information from all sides during the initial days of his tenure as U.S. Ambassador to China. Zhou Jingwen and other members of the Northeast branch of the China Democratic League visited Marshall yesterday and made a second visit today. General Marshall had lunch with Zhou Enlai, during which he reviewed the Communist Party's position. After two hours of detailed discussion, the Communist side praised him as "an expert at listening to opinions," and stated that he was extremely interested in the resumption of unity negotiations and the upcoming Political Consultative Conference. He used his own translator to ask Zhou various questions, seeking his views on the Communist Party's perspective on the current situation and future prospects of China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] U.S. Special Envoy to China, Marshal Marshall, has been very busy receiving various figures in recent days. Today, Marshall went to the U.S. Embassy to work, summoning staff from the embassy and affiliated agencies such as the naval attaché and army attaché offices for discussions and instructions. In the morning, U.S. government financial advisor Dr. Young visited. In the afternoon, Marshall paid a return visit to British Prime Minister's representative to China, General Wyatt. In the evening, U.S. Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Robertson hosted a banquet for Marshall.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 22nd] U.S. Ambassador to China General Marshall is expected to arrive in Beiping within the next 48 hours, possibly tomorrow. Final preparations are underway here tonight.</p>
<h3>President of the Executive Yuan, Song, Flies to Beiping Yesterday; Inspects the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Assets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen spent two and a half days in Shanghai and flew to Beiping on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) special plane yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. He will stop briefly in Qingdao en route. Barring unforeseen circumstances, he is expected to arrive at 5:00 PM. Accompanying Song are Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Zhu Zhongdao, Counselor Xu Shijun, Secretary Jiang Liping, Yin Zhongrong, and staff members Li Shuhui, Zhu Guangmu, and over ten others. The outside world knew very little beforehand, so those who went to the airport to see him off were only the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan Peng Xuepei, the Director of the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Assets Management Bureau Liu Gongyun, and a few others. Peng immediately convened a meeting upon returning to the office to discuss in detail everything that Zhu had instructed before leaving, which did not end until 12:30 PM. It is also learned that Song had originally planned to come to Shanghai ten days ago, but was delayed due to Chairman Chiang's inspection tour of Beiping and the capital. After inspecting the general handling of enemy and puppet assets in North China, he will return to Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 27th] President Song's CNAC plane landed at Qingcangkou Airport in Qingdao at noon on the 27th. He disembarked to rest for a moment, had some refreshments, and then flew to Beiping on the same plane.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, flew from Shanghai to Beiping on a special plane on the morning of the 27th, arriving at Nanyuan Airport at 4:05 PM. Director Li from the Beiping Garrison, on behalf of the Beiping Garrison Commander, Deputy Chief of Staff Li, Chief of Staff Wang, Commander of the 11th War Area Sun, Mayor Xiong, Committee Member Wang Shiding representing the Municipal Party Department, and special envoys from various ministries in Beiping all went to the airport to welcome him. President Song, although having traveled a long distance, was in high spirits. After disembarking, he shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with those who welcomed him. He was then accompanied by the leaders in Beiping to travel by car to his official residence to rest. President Song also attended a reception banquet at the customs office in Dongjiaominxiang at 6:00 PM that evening, inquiring in detail about the current situation in North China.</p>
<h3>The Era of Beijing Returns; A Strong Atmosphere of Establishing the Capital There</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The era of Beiping seems to be passing, and the era of Beijing seems to be arriving. Today, Zhang Ji, a high-ranking official from North China, opened his speech at a press conference here with "friends from the Beijing press," and he specifically explained that he will also say Beijing from now on, and no longer use Beiping, because Chairman Chiang always says Beijing, and not Beiping, in every speech he makes during this visit to Beiping. Our newspaper reporter asked this veteran responsible for planning the Western Capital whether Beiping is suitable for establishing the capital. He said: "In recent times, the atmosphere of establishing the capital in Beiping is indeed strong. His personal opinion is also to advocate establishing the capital in Beiping, and he hopes that the press will publicize it more." Regarding the Western Capital, he said that the Western Capital lacks water and does not have enough conditions. Planning the Western Capital was a last resort plan during the September 18th Incident.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Shandong Area Surrender Their Swords and Sign the Surrender Yesterday; Japanese Troops in Jinan Begin Disarmament</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 27th] Lieutenant General Hosokawa Tadayasu, the Japanese Liaison Officer for the Shandong Area, ordered all 70,000+ Japanese troops to surrender their swords to the designated surrender officer, General Li Yannian, at 10:15 AM on the 27th. The Japanese officers participating in the signing of the surrender included Lieutenant General Hosokawa Tadayasu, Division Commander Lieutenant General Watanabe Hiroshi, Chief of Staff Colonel Hanakawa Yoshihiro, Adjutant Chief Lieutenant Colonel Iwahoshishin Hiko, and Staff Officer Major Suzuki Ichiro. The Chinese officials participating in the surrender ceremony were Deputy Commander Yang Yekong, Chief of Staff Liang Jianxin, Army Commander Huo Shouyi, and Army Commander Liao Yunze. The ceremony was simple and solemn, lasting a total of 15 minutes. Chairman He Siyuan and the leaders of party, government, and military agencies all attended to observe the ceremony. After Deputy Commander Li took his seat, he led the five Japanese representatives into the ceremony. Deputy Commander Li then issued Order No. 1 from Jinan on the spot. Hosokawa signed it upon receiving it, and then presented a receipt. He then removed his sword, presented it to the designated surrender officer, saluted, and withdrew. Afterwards, Deputy Commander Li made a brief speech, wishing the Republic of China a boundless future. The ceremony ended at 10:15 AM. Deputy Commander Li hosted a banquet at noon to entertain all participants. The entire city of Jinan raised flags to celebrate.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After signing the surrender on the morning of the 27th, the Japanese troops in the Jinan-Qingdao-Dezhou area have already had several thousand of their troops disarmed. On the day following the signing of the surrender, more than 7,000 additional troops will be disarmed, and the rest will be processed in succession before being repatriated to their home country.</p>
<h3>Chinese Typesetting Machine Successfully Researched</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing Airmail] A Chinese typesetting machine has been successfully researched. From now on, the work of typesetting and page layout will also enter mechanization.

<h3>Prescribing Improvement Measures to Accelerate the Redemption of Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] One of the most vigorous tasks currently being undertaken by the Central Bank in the recovered areas is the redemption of counterfeit currency. However, although the procedures of banks entrusted by the Central Bank to redeem counterfeit currency in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places have been improved repeatedly, all parties still find them slow. It is now known that Yu Hongjun, the president of the Central Bank, in order to accelerate the handling of counterfeit currency redemption work and to facilitate the people, specially issued detailed instructions on improvement principles at the board meeting on the 27th as follows: (1) Banks or agencies entrusted to redeem counterfeit currency should strive to be widespread to facilitate the public's exchange. (2) When currency holders request redemption, they should be redeemed as soon as they arrive, without registration, in order to save procedures. (3) All localities should immediately follow the current improvement measures in Shanghai, collect counterfeit currency and deposit legal currency, and allow withdrawal at any time without restriction. (4) The Central Bank should give priority to handling the receipt of counterfeit currency and transfers from various redemption agencies. Over-the-counter redemption work can be reduced appropriately. The above principles have been forwarded by the Central Bank to branches in Beijing and Shanghai and their entrusted banks or agencies for uniform implementation.</p>

<h3>Losses of Private Shipping Industry During the Eight-Year War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Zhong Shandao, a standing committee member of the Private Ship Wartime Loss Compensation Committee, met with the press on the 27th to report on the losses of private ships over the past eight years. These include: (1) ships requisitioned and sunk for coastal and Yangtze River blockade defense projects; (2) ships lost during military and public transportation; (3) ships captured by the enemy during the war; (4) ships bombed and destroyed by the enemy, totaling 206 vessels, 29,632,124 tons. The biggest difficulty for China's shipping industry after the victory is how to quickly recover in a short period of time. The enemy has a large shipbuilding capacity after surrender. Within ten years, Japan will still control the maritime power in the Far East. Therefore, it is proposed to ask the government (1) to allow guarantees to foreign countries so that shipping companies can order ships from foreign countries and repay them in installments; (2) to establish methods to encourage private shipping companies to expand tonnage, subsidize, and improve management.</p>

<h3>Construction of Yangtze River Water Conservancy Project; Technical Design Phase Begins; China Has Paid Initial Working Costs; Engineers and Technical Experts in the United States Participate in the Project</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th, Associated Press] Engineers from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will begin designing a general plan for developing the Yangtze River basin. The Chinese government plans to build the world's largest dam and hydroelectric plant in the Yangtze River basin, irrigating ten million acres of land and preventing the area from suffering floods again. However, this project is still in the technical design stage, not the engineering design stage. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes announced that the Chinese government has paid the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation $250,000 to cover initial planning work expenses. It is estimated that the total project cost will reach approximately $500,000. Bureau officials emphasized that the United States will only be limited to supplying design and methodology books for the Yangtze River development plan in China, and all expenses and engineering aspects will be handled solely by the Chinese government. The payment by the Chinese government is based on a recent agreement and was transferred by the New York Office of the Resources Commission. According to the recent regulations, U.S. engineers will be responsible for the entire design and detailed methodology books of "a grand irrigation and hydroelectric power generation plan aimed at storing and controlling the water power of the Yangtze River to develop China's agriculture and industry." In addition to the aforementioned giant dam and hydroelectric plant, the plan also prepares to build hundreds of miles of crisscrossing irrigation canals and small dams, as well as other facilities to regulate the Yangtze River and its tributaries. The main engineering feature of this plan is to build a dam on the Yangtze River at the Three Gorges near Yichang to create a reservoir that is 250 miles long. This dam will be even larger than the famous Grand Coulee Dam in the United States. Its power generation facilities will generate a huge amount of electricity to develop industry, and the Yangtze River's shipping facilities will also be improved so that large ships can penetrate deep into China. Chinese engineers and technical experts will participate in the planning work under the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation engineers.</p>

<h3>Gold and Silver Hoard in Jiangxi Found to Have Been Stolen</h3>
<h3>Heir Files Lawsuit with Anhui-Jiangxi Supervisory Envoy's Office, Sufficient to Resume Track-Laying Project on Entire Nanchang-Xunyang Line</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jiujiang, 27th] The case of a large amount of gold and silver hoard discovered in Zhaobin Village, Shangfu Town, Fengxin County, Jiangxi Province, being stolen has caused a sensation throughout the province. The hoard is located in the Wang family of Zhaobin Village and was originally the property of a prominent official during the Qing Dynasty. Later generations, due to the decline of the family, transferred the house to the Liu family, timber merchants from Wucheng. The Wang family descendants were unaware of the hoard's location and only attached a note in the sales contract, stating that if a hoard was discovered in the house in the future, it should still belong to the Wang family. After the Liu family took over the property, they successfully operated the timber business and also became wealthy. Not only did they not excavate the hoard on their property, but they also continued to add to the hoard. In 1942, the villagers of the village took advantage of the Liu family's absence to evacuate and stole eleven hoards. Later, armed soldiers excavated thirty-seven hoards. Liu Sixun, the heir of the Liu family, returned to his hometown and discovered that as many as forty-eight hoards had been stolen. He filed a lawsuit with the Anhui-Jiangxi Supervisory Envoy's Office. It is said that the amount of gold and silver lost is very large, sufficient to resume the track-laying project on the entire Nanchang-Xunyang line.</p>

<h3>Also Agreed to Establish Atomic Energy Commission</h3>
<h3>Byrnes Left Moscow Yesterday Morning to Return to the United States</h3>
<p>(This Newspaper News) According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 27th: The Three-Power Conference has ended, and US Secretary of State Byrnes left Moscow today to return to the United States. He is expected to arrive in Washington on the 29th. After reporting on the conference to Truman, he will fly to London again within a week to attend the first plenary session of the United Nations on January 10. According to reliable sources, this conference was very constructive, and four important decisions were made: (1) Japan will be jointly controlled by a committee organized by the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China; (2) Korea will be temporarily jointly managed by a committee organized by the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and China for five years until the Korean government is sound. After the expiration, it will be granted independence, and it was agreed that the United States will govern the south and the Soviet Union will govern the north; (3) Peace treaties will be signed with Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, Finland, and Romania; (the draft treaties have been drawn up) (4) An agreement has been reached on the issue of atomic energy, and recommendations will be submitted at the general assembly in January. In addition, the issues of Turkey and Iran were also discussed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Moscow Radio announced: The Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference closed at 3:03 this morning (Greenwich Mean Time, 11:03 AM Shanghai time). US Secretary of State Byrnes said that the meeting had concrete results, and the final communiqué will be issued at 3:00 AM on Friday (11:00 AM Shanghai time). An American commentator reported on Moscow Radio that the three foreign ministers met for six and a half hours yesterday afternoon and continued to discuss after dinner. Yesterday was the most intense day of work, but the process was very satisfactory, and the future is very promising.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] A Columbia Broadcasting Company commentator recently broadcast from Moscow that US Secretary of State Byrnes left Moscow at 8:30 this morning (4:30 PM Shanghai time) to fly to Washington. Byrnes originally planned to return to the United States via Berlin and Paris, but weather conditions forced him to change his plan and had to cross the Balkan Peninsula to Naples, and then fly to Casablanca. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, and all Soviet representatives who participated in the Moscow Conference went to the airport to see him off. British Foreign Secretary Bevin hopes to leave Moscow this afternoon, but has not decided.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Talks: The Meeting is Very Constructive</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 27th] After the Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference ended, US Secretary of State Byrnes hosted a press conference and said: Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have agreed to establish a committee on atomic energy. This meeting was very constructive, and the relationship between the representatives of the three countries was very harmonious, and they were able to explain their problems in a friendly spirit. There is one point that I can tell you, that is, there is no agreement on any topic not recorded in the communiqué. I say this because some people want to know if there are any secret agreements on topics not mentioned, which is quite important. The communiqué will mention atomic energy and stipulate the establishment of a committee. When you see the communiqué, you can explain the problem, and nothing outside the communiqué was discussed. The final communiqué will be issued at 3:00 AM on Friday (11:00 AM Shanghai time). In addition to the events recorded in the communiqué, the three foreign ministers also informally discussed several other events, exchanged opinions, and clarified them to the governments of the respective countries, so it will be easier to take actions agreed by the three governments in the future. Byrnes also said that an "economic agreement" had been discussed in the meeting, and its main points will be announced in the communiqué. He also said that he had notified the French ambassador in Washington and after arriving in Moscow that no events affecting the French government would be discussed except for the peace conference, and any events affecting France would be notified to the French side. As for events affecting China, the Chinese government will also be constantly notified. The last meeting of the three foreign ministers was held on the eleventh and twelfth days after the start of the meeting, lasting for thirteen and a half hours, with two short breaks for meals. The last break was at 2:30 AM today (10:30 AM Shanghai time). One hour later, the three foreign ministers gathered and signed the documents.</p>
<p>Qualified observers in London believe that the issues of Iran and other issues in the Middle East were discussed in the meeting, but they will not be recorded in the final communiqué. If the general public believes that compromises have been reached on other important topics that may have been discussed in the meeting, then this meeting will greatly advance the cooperation of the three powers. London also speculates that the results of the Moscow talks may include an agreement on Allied cooperation in the Far East, such as the establishment of an Allied Council for Japan in addition to the Far Eastern Advisory Commission.</p>
<h3>United Nations Organization</h3>

The newspaper said that the most popular Secretary-General candidate at present is Canadian Ambassador to the United States Pearson, who is more popular than Belgium's Spaak or the Netherlands' Kleffens.

<h3>MacArthur Reduces the Power of the Japanese Emperor</h3>
<h3>Helping Japan Build a Democratic Government</h3>
<h3>Eradicating the Control System and Restoring Freedom and Independence to the People</h3>
<h3>Socialist Party Demands that the Prime Minister Should Be Elected by the People</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Tokyo, 27th Exclusive] The Shinto religion in Japan has now been abolished, so the last evil root of the Emperor system has been eliminated, and feudal tendencies have gradually disappeared in the minds of the people. The first step of the Allied Headquarters to transform Japan was to abolish the Japanese Army and Navy Ministry, and ordered Japan to surrender all weapons. After that, another far-reaching action was to destroy the power of the Japanese imperial police and all thought control. At the same time, in order to make the disarmament of the Japanese army effective, the Allies must give the Japanese people freedom of speech, assembly, and belief in the early stage of the occupation. In addition, the Allies implemented currency control, agricultural reform, the right of workers to collectively negotiate with capitalists, and equitable distribution of food, so that the people were completely out of the control of the military and moved towards democratic politics.</p>
<p>The previous controlled life of the Japanese people was the main factor in creating the ruling power of the Emperor system, and the tool of the ruling group was the distribution of grace and war profits. The Japanese government collected taxes entirely by manipulation, so that the Japanese people struggled for survival all the time. However, the above controls have now been completely destroyed, and the Emperor system has also ceased to exist. According to MacArthur's instructions, the Japanese government will start to implement the agricultural reform bill in the middle of next month. The bill stipulates that the land owned by each person should be limited to 12 mu. MacArthur has not yet expressed his opinion on this. The Ministry of Finance is studying and drafting two regulations on the collection of property tax from the Japanese Emperor. In order to support Japanese democracy, MacArthur, trade unions, chambers of commerce, and legal entities in various places have begun to organize, and the strength of new political parties is also becoming stronger day by day. The Japanese Communist Party requested that the general election be postponed for several months so that the people's thinking and the organization of new political parties can be improved and become equal to the old political parties. The newly established Independent Socialist Party demanded that the Japanese Prime Minister should be elected by the Japanese people and can no longer be appointed by the Japanese Emperor. At present, the task placed before the Japanese people by the Allies is to establish an equal government to replace the supreme Emperor government. This is an important task that must be closely monitored and guided by the Allies in order to promote its realization as soon as possible and accomplish the task of the Allied occupation of Japan.</p>

The Japanese authorities explained this as an avoidance of damage from air raids, but failed to explain why they did not report it to the Allies in advance.</p>
<h3>Philippine Traitor Willing to Be the Enemy's Lackey: Castile Executed</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Manila, 27th] Philippine traitor Castile, who induced about 1,000 Filipinos to be massacred by the Japanese army, was sentenced to death by the People's Court today. In March of this year, Castile falsely claimed that the Japanese army could guarantee safety and lured the villagers of Lumpet to gather in one place, all of whom were massacred by the Japanese army. This is the first Philippine traitor to be sentenced to death, setting an important precedent for all those who act as lackeys for the Japanese.</p>
<h3>U.S. Plans to Expand Global Air Routes, But Only a Small Portion Can Be Opened</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] Global air transportation is developing rapidly, and eventually airplanes will be able to reach any location at any time. The U.S. has drafted detailed plans for such air routes, and has also prepared sufficient personnel, equipment, funding, and management talent. However, because governments have not agreed on the exchange of commercial airspace rights, only a small portion of air routes can be opened at present, except for military transport.</p>
<p>U.S. air routes are advancing towards Europe, with two companies already operating routes to the UK. One company will extend its routes to the Nordic countries, while the other plans to fly along the southern coast of Europe, via the Mediterranean to Egypt and India. The Great Circle route across the North Pacific may be opened later, as the Soviet Union has not yet expressed its attitude towards commercial aviation rights, and the North Pacific route has never been used by civil aviation aircraft, requiring more surveying and training work.</p>
<p>Recently, the most frequently flown routes have been those in the Central Pacific, South Pacific, and South Atlantic. In addition to the political issues of obtaining aviation rights, airline executives also face other thorny issues, such as maintaining ground equipment, collecting weather reports, and establishing communication networks, ensuring seamless operation in all countries.</p>
<p>Political issues stem from national sovereignty and economic concerns, making them difficult to resolve. However, significant progress has been made since the World Aviation Conference held in Chicago last year. The Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, composed of thirty-seven countries, is currently studying various issues.</p>
<p>The organization's headquarters are located in Montreal, Canada. The U.S., without waiting for free airspace rights or a general agreement, is first negotiating with relevant countries one by one to establish mutual agreements, seeking temporary solutions. If the U.S. does not proceed in this way, its enormous aviation potential will be indefinitely limited to the Americas. Other countries are also following suit, with the UK being particularly prominent.</p>
<p>In terms of achievements, twenty countries have accepted the so-called "two freedoms of the air," namely the mutual exchange of rights to fly over national borders or land in other countries. Some countries have even accepted the "five freedoms," in exchange for allowing commercial aircraft to enter and exit their borders. In short, agreements are signed by the parties involved, allowing for the exchange of general rights. Through the promotion of the "two freedoms," large areas of previously inaccessible airspace have been opened up, some of which are essential for the world's most important air routes, such as Canada, Newfoundland, the British Isles, the United States, China, India, France, the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, and some South American countries. With the establishment of mutual agreements, both parties can truly obtain aviation rights in the aforementioned important regions.</p>
<p>In addition, there are extremely difficult technical problems that are inevitable, such as the maintenance of airport, airway, weather reporting, and communication equipment. Currently, this equipment is managed by military transport agencies, but with the end of the war, military personnel are gradually demobilizing, and funding is also gradually decreasing, with valuable equipment being removed or abandoned. The aforementioned international provisional organization is considering this issue and has begun to examine what equipment is necessary and how to continue to operate it without abandoning it. If all member states agree, the organization will have the authority to manage this matter or act as an intermediary between countries.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] Mr. Frailey, the current president of Continental and Western Airlines, announced today that the company's international air routes will fly east from the United States to Europe, via the Near East to Bombay and Colombo, and then extend to Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. The company expects to obtain aviation rights to extend its air routes eastward from Bombay and Colombo to the west coast of the Pacific, or from India in two directions to Shanghai. However, the proposed route may not pass through Colombo, the Malay Peninsula, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and then to China. Another route is from India to Singapore, and then from Singapore to Hong Kong. The company's proposed Far East aviation expansion plan may be connected to the air route that flies west from the United States via the North Pacific to Shanghai. The company will also apply to open a Pacific air route, and once approved, its planned round-the-world flight will be realized. Expanding the Far East aviation industry can promote its economic development, airplanes can expand trade and create more opportunities for the people, and airlines can help break down trade barriers and increase much-needed transportation. It is hoped that these rights can be obtained from relevant parties in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Prepares to Stay in Germany for Another Decade, American Reporter Reports on Inspection</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Berlin, 27th] Within eight months of Germany's defeat, the Soviet Red Army has transformed northeastern Germany from a destroyed machine into a peacetime institution, and the Soviet army is prepared to stay there for a long time—at least ten years. The Soviet army and German liberals (mostly Communists) are working closely together. Recently, a group of foreign reporters spent eight days inspecting 750 miles of the Soviet-occupied zone and finally discovered what the Soviet army has accomplished.</p>
<p>In the past few months, Germany has spread rumors that the Russian-occupied zone has fallen into chaos and disorganization, but the foreign reporters' inspection proved that the Soviet Union is very realistic and effective in handling occupation affairs.</p>
<p>There are absolutely no unemployed people in the Soviet-occupied zone, because the Soviet Union has abolished the old bank loan system, requiring every German to work for food. Inflation is better than in the west, and most non-war industries have resumed work, but war factories have either been dismantled or transported away as compensation.</p>
<p>Rumors that there is no industrial activity at all in the Soviet-occupied zone are dismissed with a smile by German provincial officials. Currently, 85 percent of non-war factories have begun manufacturing consumer goods. Active Nazis have been imprisoned, and nominal leaders have also been replaced. The Soviet Union's attitude towards Germans who are not radical Nazis seems to be more lenient than that of the United States, which has expelled all Nazis, but the Soviet Union has handed this issue over to the German public government to handle.</p>
<p>Metal and mineral mines are not allowed to operate, but all coal mines are in operation. Production is almost the same as before the war. As for food, German officials told reporters that the current food supply cannot be maintained for long.</p>
<p>Germans have absolute freedom of religious belief. Soviet officials said, "You can't make cannons in churches."</p>
<p>The Soviet authorities did their best to give reporters a good impression. A Soviet major who accompanied the reporters on their inspections was completely exhausted after returning to Berlin. The five American reporters were also quite tired because they had "toasted" Soviet-American friendship no less than 10,000 times.</p>
<p>The American reporters were welcomed and treated well everywhere they went. Although the Soviet Union monitored them, they were responsive to the reporters' requests. There was only one exception: the American reporters requested to inspect the Province of Shalingji, which was rejected by the Soviet Union on the grounds that the location was not within the designated inspection area.</p>
<h3>U.S. Pacific Five Air Forces Under Unified Command of MacArthur to Control Japan and Strengthen Air Defense</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur announced today that the five Pacific air forces will be under unified command in order to control Japan and strengthen America's vast air defenses. The air force is named the U.S. Army Pacific Air Forces, and the position of commander has been promoted from General Kenney, the former commander of the Far East Air Forces, with Lieutenant General Whitehead, the former commander of the Fifth Air Force, as deputy commander, and Major General Climent as chief of staff. The forward headquarters are located in Tokyo, and this headquarters governs five air forces, namely (1) the Fifth Air Force stationed in Korea and Japan, (2) the Seventh Air Force stationed in Hawaii, (3) the Eighth Air Force stationed in Tokyo, (4) the Thirteenth Air Force stationed in the Philippines, and (5) the Twentieth Air Force stationed in the Mariana Islands. The personnel quotas of each army remain the same, with General MacArthur as the supreme commander, and Major General Hulph as the commander of the Tokyo forward headquarters. Hulph, who previously served as commander of the Twentieth Bombardment Unit in India and China, also serves as commander of the Fifth Air Force. Among the five air forces, the Eighth and Twentieth Air Forces originally belonged to the U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces, while the remaining three air forces belonged to the Far East Air Forces.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 27th] According to today's announcement, MacArthur will have two new aides to assist him, one being Colonel Weller, who will serve as senior aide and army secretary, and the other being Lieutenant Hogan. During the war, only four other people served as MacArthur's aides.</p>
<h3>British Troops Besieged in Batavia, Set Up Alert Lines</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Resumes in Bandung Area</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 27th] Allied Commander General Christison of Java has ordered the deployment of military alert lines around Batavia to identify people entering and leaving Batavia and prevent bandits and terrorists from infiltrating. The Allied Headquarters Bulletin stated that the deployment of military alert lines is a necessary initial measure to stabilize the city's order and ensure the safety of all ethnic groups. It is reported that no unexpected incidents have occurred since the military authorities were ordered to take this measure. Previously, only troops were stationed at certain key roads in the suburbs of Batavia, which was not as strict as this time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 27th] The Allied forces will begin new operations based on the decisions of the Singapore Conference. The British and Indian troops in Bandung continue to clear out the extremists in the area. Street fighting has occurred, and they have finally occupied the extremists' base, seizing some military supplies, food, and clothing. Allied Headquarters said that the extremists used Chinese people as shields to prevent the British and Indian troops from sweeping through the area. Gunfire can still be heard in Batavia at night. The Indian artillery that bombarded the Chinese-owned civilian camp in Angbala several weeks ago has also begun operating 30 miles north of the area.</p>
<h3>U.S. Rear Admiral Sherman Appointed Chief of Operations</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 27th] Rear Admiral Sherman was appointed today as Chief of Operations of the Naval Headquarters. Rear Admiral Sherman previously served as Deputy Chief of Staff to Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the Pacific Fleet. After transferring to his new position, he can continue to work with Admiral Nimitz, Chief of Naval Operations.</p>
<h3>European U.S. Occupation Zone, Refugees Seek to Move to America</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] President Truman revealed in a statement from the White House that he had instructed the State Department and the Attorney General to expedite the transfer of vagrants and refugees in the U.S. military occupation zone in Europe to the United States, in order to "alleviate human suffering and set an example for other countries in the world." The President emphasized that this aid measure will be strictly implemented in accordance with immigration laws and will not delay the return of overseas military personnel. He also stated that the current focus on Europe does not mean that passports will be completely suspended in other parts of the world.</p>
<h3>International Women's Association Demands Overthrow of Franco Regime, France Has Invited Britain and the United States to Hold a Meeting to Jointly Review the Spanish Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the United States has received a document from France requesting a study of future relations with Franco. He said that France may convene a three-country conference, and said that the United States is "happy" to review all aspects of the Spanish issue. It is expected that France will suggest severing relations with the Franco regime.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Britain, the United States, and France will convene a meeting to discuss the attitude to be taken towards the Franco government in Spain. The meeting can begin as soon as France decides on the time and place. France recently sent a message to Britain and the United States suggesting a break in relations with Spain. Britain and the United States replied that they were prepared to meet with the French government to discuss the matter. However, Britain's reply did not advocate an immediate break in relations, and the United States, while not expressing sympathy for the Spanish government, remained silent on the issue of a break in relations. The United States believes that it is sufficient not to allow the Franco government to become stable at present, and there is no need to encourage a change of government. It is generally believed that the British government's reply must not have concealed the Labor Party government's aversion to the Franco regime, and it hopes to establish a stable democratic government as soon as possible. Last night, the Spanish Free Radio called on the people to join the guerrillas to overthrow the Franco regime, and the International Women's Democratic Association in Paris also sent a telegram to the foreign ministers of the three major powers in Moscow, representing 81 million members, demanding the overthrow of the Franco regime. The association was established after the International Women's Congress closed, and China is also a member.</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw Suggests Innovative Alphabet to Write Each Sound with Simple Symbols</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 27th] Literary giant George Bernard Shaw wrote to The Times today, urging the British government to establish a committee to draft a new alphabet so that every sound in the English language can be written with a single stroke and simple symbols, even without punctuation. The time saved by the new alphabet can immediately repay the cost of the war. According to Shaw, phonetic spelling can replace Dr. Johnson's erroneous spelling in the past. For example, the word "bomb" should be spelled "bom," omitting the final silent letter "b." He can write "bomb" eighteen times in one minute, which is roughly identifiable, but "bom" can be written twenty-four times, saving a quarter of the time. As for the daydreams of ordinary people, such as advocating the promotion of a world language, the alphabet drafting committee should clearly declare that it has no intention of participating.</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting Cessation of Grain Coupon Issuance</p>
<p>The county government intends to issue circulating coupons due to insufficient funds allocated for purchasing military grain at the provincial price, as reported in this newspaper. Now, County Magistrate Huang believes that Chamber of Rice Industry Director Zhu Ziyu is avoiding responsibility by feigning illness, leading to misunderstanding. Zhu Ziyu has been arrested and taken into custody from Shanghai with a deadline to deliver the grain. Regarding the issue of issuing circulating coupons, Wu Shaoshu and other fellow villagers from Songjiang residing in Shanghai have sent telegrams to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Special Commissioner Xie of the Third District, and County Magistrate Huang, requesting the cessation of issuance and requesting the provincial government to allocate funds to purchase grain in order to avoid disrupting the financial system.</p>
<p>Traitor Ye Jiugao and Others Escorted to Suzhou</p>
<p>Ye Jiugao, the former director of the Puppet Rice Control Association, has been arrested by the county government. As the case of a traitor should be tried by the High Court, he was escorted to the Suzhou High Court for interrogation, along with Gao Yalin, Xia Chunshan, and others who were arrested in other cases for translating for the Japanese enemy. A police team was assigned to escort them together.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>County Magistrate and Garrison Commander Inspect Together</p>
<p>County Magistrate An Weinan, out of concern for public security, inspected Baimao, a border town in the eastern township, together with Garrison Commander Yu, receiving a warm welcome from the local people. At the same time, the North District Command of the Changwuqing Suppression Zone announced that a curfew would be implemented from 11:00 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. every day, starting today, to strictly prevent the activities of traitors and puppets and maintain public security.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>County Government Ordered to Encourage Purchase of Military Grain</p>
<p>The county government has been ordered to encourage the purchase of 80,000 shi of military grain. Rice merchants in the urban area have already purchased 20,000 shi and delivered them to the warehouse for acceptance. The remaining 60,000 shi will be purchased in two more installments. The first 20,000 shi will be purchased from the rural area. The county government has ordered the four rural district offices to encourage the purchase, with a deadline for delivery. The price is set at 5,000 yuan per shi, including transportation costs, with penalties for overcharging or under-delivering. Incentive measures have also been established and ordered to be followed.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Tax Rice Collection Situation</p>
<p>In Jiaxing, the amount of tax rice collected by landlords from tenant farmers has traditionally been determined annually by party and government personnel and farmer representatives in each district after investigating the harvest yield. The amount is agreed upon in accordance with the 25% rent reduction policy and announced for both parties to comply with. The harvest yield this year has already been investigated and agreed upon. The harvest yield in Jianan (i.e., the old Jiayi) is 1.4 shi per mu. After the 25% rent reduction, the tax rice payable is 5 dou and 2.5 sheng. After deducting 8 sheng for borrowing to purchase military grain, the actual amount collected is 4 dou and 4.5 sheng. In Jiabei (i.e., the old Xiuyi), the yield is 1.6 shi per mu. After the rent reduction, the tax rice payable is 6 dou. After deducting 8 sheng for borrowing to purchase military grain, the actual amount collected is 5 dou and 2 sheng. Currently, the landlords believe that it is time to collect rent since the winter solstice has passed, while the tenant farmers believe that the set amount of tax rent is too high, so most are waiting and not paying.</p>
<p>Wenling</p>
<p>Smooth Navigation Between Wenling, Shanghai, and Wenzhou</p>
<p>Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang has gradually recovered under the active reconstruction efforts of the local government. Since the beginning of this month, four commercial vessels, including "Chuanshan" and "Dahua," and three steamers have been sailing directly to Shanghai from Wenzhou. In addition, three "Jiangdong" steamers are sailing between Taizhou and Wenling, providing convenience for merchants and travelers, which has further boosted the local economy. However, due to purchases by Shanghai merchants, the prices of local products have been gradually rising.</p>

<h3>The Scenery of Yunshan and Zhujiang is Unchanged, New Guangzhou Marches Forward</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Baiyun Mountain is as lush as ever, and the Zhujiang River flows on as it always has. Returning to Guangzhou after an absence of seven years, I, the reporter, see the Pearl River and the mountains, still much as they were. Although during these seven years, this place has been shrouded in gloom, producing many tragic stories and burying much blood and tears, now, finally, after the rain comes the clear sky, and after the clouds, the sun rises, making one deeply rejoice: the land has been restored to light!</p>
<p>As I stepped onto the docks of Guangzhou, the first thing that caught my eye was the magnificent Haizhu Bridge, spanning the Zhujiang River, and the Ai Qun Hotel, standing tall with its seventeen stories. Seeing them safe and sound brought a sense of infinite comfort. Indeed, while these two buildings may not fully represent Guangzhou, I believe every Guangzhou resident returning after seven years would inevitably feel the same way!</p>
<p>Heavy Traffic - Changdi is More Prosperous Than Before</p>
<p>Changdi is even more prosperous than before, with heavy traffic on the roads, and people bustling about, extremely crowded. Especially at night, the large restaurants such as Datong, Jinlun, Jinlong, and Dasanyuan are brightly lit and filled with music, with virtually no empty seats. The Ai Qun, White Palace, Xinhua, Dongya, and several newly opened large hotels are always fully booked, and travelers from outside have difficulty finding a room even after waiting for more than a week. On the surface, it seems that Guangzhou's market is now more prosperous than before the war, but this is only the case in the Changdi area. If you leave this area and stroll along the other roads in the city, you will find that Guangzhou is in a dilapidated state. Just look at the area behind the Xidi Daxin Company. Originally, it was full of buildings with four or five stories or more, but now it is almost a flat ground, desolate and deserted. Although one or two buildings stand alone, they are just empty shells. The most bustling Xiguan Shiba Pu and Hanmin Road in the city are no longer what they used to be, eerily quiet. There are no newly built buildings, and the original ones are mostly dilapidated, making one think of the line "The carved railings and jade stairs should still be there, but the fair face has changed." Almost every road is riddled with holes, and riding in a rickshaw will make your buttocks ache. The streets and lanes are full of garbage, and every corner is piled with flies. From all this, it is clear that during the seven years of occupation, Guangzhou only experienced destruction and no construction. The traitors of the puppet regime only cared about plundering money and oppressing the people, and did not even bother to repair the roads or take care of sanitation. This transformed the once picturesque and vibrant birthplace of revolution into a listless old man, like a declining and broken household, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Disciplined Military - Citizens Immediately Express Goodwill</p>
<p>After the victory, the first troops to enter the city were the Special Operations Forces, whose military discipline was poor, leaving a bad impression on the people. However, soon after, the New First Army arrived, changing the people's perception. Because the New First Army's achievements in Burma may not be easily known to the people in the occupied areas, they would know that the Japanese army had been defeated in Burma. Therefore, they knew that this army was the one that defeated the Japanese, and they naturally had infinite respect and welcome for these expeditionary soldiers. In particular, the New First Army's equipment was entirely American-style: steel helmets, thick khaki uniforms, yellow leather boots, Thompson submachine guns... All this was not only novel to the people in the occupied areas, but even the people who had returned from the interior seemed to have never seen such equipped troops. They all said in unison: Our country has indeed become stronger!</p>
<p>Public Security - The Most Serious Problem</p>
<p>Public security is probably the most serious problem that any recovered area would consider, and Guangzhou is no exception. One often hears news of bandits breaking into houses with weapons and robberies on the streets. According to Police Chief Li Guojun's report, more than 50 robbery cases have occurred since the takeover on September 19th. Strangely, most of these robberies occurred in the residences of Taiwanese and former officials of the puppet regime, and more than 30 cases have already been solved. However, the military and police authorities are still actively working to maintain public security. A curfew is still in effect after 10 p.m., and no people or vehicles are allowed to pass without a curfew pass. One night, the reporter was questioned by more than five sentries on a journey of less than 100 meters, which shows the extent of the security. Previously, these sentries were dispatched by the New First Army, but now the security team of the Provincial Security Headquarters is responsible for this night watch.</p>
<p>Water, Electricity, Telephone - The Authorities are Trying Their Best to Repair</p>
<p>Tap water, electricity, telephone - these are most closely related to everyone's daily life, and the current situation is that the saying "the roads are uneven, the tap water is not clear, the electricity is not bright, and the telephone is not working" is a perfect description of Guangzhou's current situation. Because the power plant, telephone office, and even the water plant, all the machinery and equipment are from eight years ago. During the enemy's occupation, there was no construction at all, and these machines have become outdated. The water reservoir has accumulated several feet of mud, and the water pipes, power lines, and telephone lines have been neglected for a long time. In this situation, what else can be done? Therefore, these problems are enough to give the municipal authorities a headache. Now the city government is making its best efforts to solve these problems. In the past two months, there have been significant results. Now we can see many workers repairing roads, repairing power lines, and repairing water pipes on the streets every day. At the same time, there have been no long-distance buses running in Guangzhou for four or five months before the liberation. Now, in order to maintain traffic in the city, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has converted the trucks left by the enemy into public buses. There are already more than 100 of these buses in operation, and the fare is very cheap, with each ticket costing only 40 yuan, regardless of distance. Military personnel and civil servants can also get half-price tickets, which provides a lot of convenience to the citizens. Another thing worth mentioning is the issue of cleanliness. It is unknown where so much garbage came from. When we came back, it was really everywhere, and the stench was overwhelming. Later, the authorities made a decision to clean it up. Mayor Chen (Ce) even personally took a broom and demonstrated in the street, and also used Japanese prisoners to take on this work. After more than a month of effort, the city is now much cleaner than before. Speaking of cleaning up garbage, I am reminded of the situation of Japanese prisoners in Guangzhou, which is also worth reporting. There are 4,689 Japanese soldiers and 3,317 Japanese nationals collected here. They are well-fed and clothed in the concentration camp, and they are leisurely and comfortable. In addition to clothing and equipment, there are also undershirts, socks, soap, cigarettes and other miscellaneous items that are adequately supplied. Moreover, the residences are very spacious, with beautiful scenery and fresh air. There are also diagnostic rooms, treatment rooms, and rest rooms. Now, every 200 Japanese prisoners are lent 10 rifles, with 10 bullets for each rifle. Under such unexpected preferential treatment, they are all grateful and tearful. Therefore, at present, in the concentration camp, their military style and public security can still maintain a good attitude.</p>
<p>Japanese Prisoners Work - No One Eats for Free</p>
<p>Recently, in order to make the most of these Japanese prisoners who are sitting and eating, the authorities have transferred a part of them with technical expertise to work as drivers and repair various machines. The rest are required to assist in cleaning. Now, every morning, you can see teams of Japanese prisoners dragging garbage trucks or carrying brooms, very obediently cleaning the streets. They are still the same, with small, pointed caps and patched "imperial" army uniforms. Everyone's faces are expressionless, and they dare not look people in the eye. Their cramped expressions look quite pitiful. One newspaper published a cartoon of a Japanese prisoner sitting on a garbage truck with a broom on his shoulder, titled "New Equipment of the Japanese Imperial Army." Another store selling wine wrote in its advertisement: "He works as a cleaner, I drink with joy." Once, the reporter had a brief conversation with a Japanese prisoner who was performing cleaning work:</p>
<p>"What do you think about being asked to do this kind of work?" the reporter asked him sympathetically.</p>
<p>"We are defeated prisoners, we can only obey orders," he replied in broken Cantonese, a somewhat unnatural smile on his face, unable to hide his inner melancholy.</p>
<p>"You sweep garbage every day, don't you have any thoughts?" the reporter asked him again.</p>
<p>"...Nothing else, I just feel that your country's garbage seems to be endless," he hesitated for a moment and said this barbed sentence.</p>
<p>"Of course, this is the garbage accumulated over seven years, of course it cannot be swept away in one day; and the bloodstains of the past seven years, I am afraid it is even more difficult to wash away!" the reporter retorted unceremoniously.</p>
<p>He just lowered his head and pondered, no longer speaking, and our conversation ended like this.</p>
<p>American Ships Arrive in Guangzhou - Prices Begin to Fall</p>
<p>Speaking of the prices in Guangzhou, they were indeed very cheap for a period of time. An ordinary shirt only cost 400-500 yuan, and a pair of leather shoes cost 3,000-4,000 yuan. However, now all prices have increased several times. Now an ordinary shirt costs more than 5,000 yuan, and a pair of leather shoes costs at least 10,000 yuan. If you want to order a suit from a tailor shop, it will cost no less than 140,000-150,000 yuan. It is said that prices are rising every day because visitors from Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang and other places, especially soldiers, all say that things are cheap and don't care, throwing money around without hesitation, so merchants are raising prices on the spot. In fact, this is certainly one of the reasons, but the main reason is that the stock is limited and foreign ships have not yet brought goods, so all goods are becoming less and less every day. The so-called demand exceeds supply, so of course there is no reason why prices should not rise. However, since this week, because two American ships have arrived in Hong Kong, bringing a lot of goods, and more will come in the future, department stores have already started to fall back. Merchants in Hong Kong and Macau are dumping large quantities of goods stored in Guangzhou. Generally people estimate that prices here will continue to fall!</p>
<p>United States to Sell Private Monoplanes</p>
<p>The United States is currently manufacturing a type of Erco Ercoupe private monoplane and has begun accepting customer orders at a price of $2,994 per plane. Note: The Erco Ercoupe private aircraft adopts a rotary design and is equipped with three special landing wheels. This aircraft can carry two passengers and can carry 5,000-6,000 pounds of baggage. The wingspan is 30 feet, the height is close to 6 feet, the fuselage is 20 feet 9 inches, the maximum range is 500 miles, and the speed per hour is 110 miles. The rudder and ailerons for maintaining aircraft balance can be controlled freely, and there are safety devices. When practicing flying, it only takes one-third of the time of ordinary aircraft.</p>
<h3>Ten Hundred Million Asians Together Strike the Bell of Peace and Freedom, Striving to Prevent the Far Eastern Storm from Sweeping the World. Translated from the December Issue of Reader's Digest.</h3>
<p>The peace of the Pacific is a paramount issue for all countries and peoples of the world. With peace in the Pacific, there is a foundation for world peace; without peace in the Pacific, the entire world will once again suffer the ravages of war.</p>
<p>Clearly, in the Pacific region, we need a new way of life. After four years of fighting the enemy, we can no longer ask a billion Asians to return to their former lives of merely providing fuel and water for other nations of the world and consider themselves content.</p>
<p>Preventing Enemy Aggression and Destroying Enemy Ideology</p>
<p>We have stopped the Japanese from aggressing, but we have not destroyed the idea that the Japanese brought with them and cultivated in this fertile soil. This idea is the so-called "Co-Prosperity Sphere," which refers to a geographical area where all peoples with similar lifestyles, skin color, and customs are united into a political whole.</p>
<p>In reality, this is just a hypocritical slogan. It only became Japan's Asia. But the idea itself is correct and cannot be morally attacked. It will endure in Asia and must not be condemned as rebellion. This is the renaissance of the Far East. Westerners can help develop it into a massive force to contribute to peace.</p>
<p>The Japanese planned to merge the various nations and countries of Asia into a single collective. This is too arbitrary and too difficult. A more reasonable idea would be to divide Asians into three major federations according to natural racial branches: the Malay, Chinese, and Indian. Here, we will first discuss the situation of the Malay Federation—a political and economic collective consisting of 200 million Malay speakers living in the Philippines, Java, Celebes, Malacca, Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Siam, Burma, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>I grew up in Asia. Shortly before the war, I traveled among the Malays through Thailand, Burma, Java, and the Straits Settlements. Everywhere I went, I observed a yearning for freedom and a rebellion against the white man.</p>
<p>In Java, underground leaders representing millions of farmers hid in secret organizations in the forests, holding midnight meetings to organize liberation movements. In Burma, the voices of the people demanding liberation could be heard everywhere—among sweepers, cinnabar miners, students, merchants, and government officials.</p>
<p>Everywhere I went, I saw the hateful racial discrimination that undermines human dignity. I saw noble Burmese women step into the mud to make way for white people. In Singapore, I saw noble Malays forbidden from entering British restaurants and clubs. I saw Cambridge and Oxford graduates barred from teaching in their own country's elementary schools because they had not bowed deeply enough to the Dutch supervisors.</p>
<p>Everywhere, there were haggard brown people wrapped in dirty sarongs, their faces filled with sorrow, barely resembling human beings. Among them were no playful children, only unfortunate little ones sold by their starving parents to become economic slaves. They did not know how to play; they had never had the energy to play.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Charter Guarantees Autonomy for All Nations</p>
<p>Therefore, it is easy to understand why, when racial hatred had the opportunity to be vented, all the white people everywhere except in the Philippines, in order to protect their own lives, not only had to defend against Japanese attacks but also had to guard against the Malays whom they had insulted for many years. Because Japanese imperialism could be used as a tool to eliminate white imperialism, these Asians accepted it first and then sought ultimate liberation.</p>
<p>This demand seems to have been answered in the Atlantic Charter, as the Atlantic Charter guaranteed autonomy to all colonies. However, the Far Eastern countries discovered that this promise was only to give freedom to the white people under Nazi shackles, not to the brown people, nor to the Asians.</p>
<p>The Malays outside the Philippines do not talk about democracy. They only say, "We hope and seek to be granted 'America' to our people." This means a way of life in which brown people not only enjoy freedom but also respect and help each other with white people. The American government in the Philippines is the source of this idea. It clearly proves that the theory that imperialists consider overly ambitious and impractical is indeed feasible.</p>
<p>The Malay Federation Fights for Human Freedom</p>
<p>Imperialists believe that the organization of the Malay Federation will not be successful.</p>
<p>The first reason is that there is no unified basis among the various Malays. Although their languages all belong to the Malay root, they speak a variety of dialects. They often engage in infighting, which only stops after Westerners intervene. Their religions are also mutually antagonistic.</p>
<p>The second reason is that, according to actual records, the exploitation suffered by Easterners under native rulers far exceeds the exploitation they suffer under Westerners. Exorbitant taxes are levied, only to fill the pockets of the local emperors and satisfy their extravagance. For ordinary people, the courts are practically non-existent, and the police system also fails to protect them.</p>
<p>The third reason is that these backward nations are not</p>
<h3>Dried Longan Market Recovers Slightly</h3>
<p>Due to the relatively abundant supply of dried longan, market prices have been declining. The price drop has exceeded half of the previous levels. Top-grade Quanzhou big-bubble longan once reached 25,000 yuan, and Xinghua dried longan also approached the 30,000 yuan mark. However, as the cost of goods procured later was higher, merchants inevitably suffered losses. Therefore, they mutually agreed to hold back and not sell, leading to a gradual improvement in the market. Yesterday, wholesalers in the northern part of the city released over two hundred items, resulting in a rebound of 1,500 yuan, and the market subsequently tightened.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a small amount of new dried longan meat was offered. The size and quality of the slices were up to standard, and the appearance was clean. The price was 70,000 yuan. Other ordinary goods were priced below 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Glass Sells Well</h3>
<p>The wartime state has passed, and reconstruction work is underway. Minor repairs are happening everywhere, especially window repairs, which are the most urgent. As a result, the sales of glass are booming, and prices are soaring. Thin glass sheets, 40 to 50 inches in size, sell for 20,000 yuan per box. Those around 60 inches are priced at 22,000 yuan. Thick glass sheets, 50 sheets of medium size (40 inches), sell for 23,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Abundant Southern Supplies; Rice Shows Signs of Weakness; Flour and Soybean Oil Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>The rice market has seen a large influx of supplies from the south, leading to sluggish sales in stores. Prices have declined by 100 to 200 yuan. White rice and Yin rice prices have also fallen by 300 to 400 yuan due to abundant supply. In the oil market, soybean oil is slightly weak, while raw tung oil remains firm. Flour prices continue to rise by over 100 yuan, but digestion in both northern and southern ports has slowed, leading to a stagnant market. Yellow beans have also decreased by 300 to 400 yuan due to weak demand in Quanzhou and Xinghua. Raw peanuts are performing well. Sesame is in short supply, and demand exceeds supply, causing prices to rise by over 1,000 yuan. Cottonseed cake is stable, while soybean cake lacks trading and remains unopened. The liquor market is active and sales are strong, leading to a further increase of 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Province Bans Sugar Exports to Exchange Sugar for Fertilizer</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 26th] Following the ban on private exports of sugar by the Taiwan Provincial Government, various parties have paid close attention. According to Governor Chen, Taiwan is known for its agricultural products such as grain and sugar. However, due to transportation disruptions and fertilizer shortages in recent years, production has declined sharply. If efforts are not made to increase grain production, there will not only be insufficient capacity to support the needs of the inland provinces in the future, but also a disruption in the supply within Taiwan. Therefore, increasing grain production in Taiwan currently relies on the import of fertilizer. To obtain fertilizer, the remaining sugar must be centralized for exchange. In addition to working with relevant parties to import large quantities of chemical raw materials from overseas, to generally encourage the supply of fertilizer, anyone or any merchant transporting ferrous sulfate or soybean cake to Taiwan can exchange it for sugar from the Taiwan Provincial Trading Company for export.</p>
<h3>Relief Wheat: 7,000 Bags Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The British Far East Shipping Management Office's British ship "Paddle Mixis" [transliteration], carrying over six thousand seven hundred and thirty bags of American relief wheat, was expected to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. However, it had not arrived by late yesterday evening. According to a telegram from the management office, the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 29th) and is scheduled to dock at buoys 31 and 32 for unloading.</p>
<h3>Fuel Market Remains Stable and Firm; White Coal Nuggets Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The coal market is generally stable without significant fluctuations. However, white coal nuggets are in immediate demand, leading to strong buying interest and gradually increasing prices. Recent arrivals at the firewood and charcoal docks are less than before. Although traders have sufficient stock, the cost of transporting goods from the docks to the warehouses adds 100 to 200 yuan, causing the market price to remain firm.</p>
<h3>Next Year's Revenue Budget</h3>
<p>Approximately 2,054 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>The estimated national revenue budget for the next year is approximately 2,054 billion yuan. The tax revenue budget is still under discussion by the Ministry of Finance after multiple deliberations. It is reportedly around 730 billion yuan, including an estimated 94.4 billion yuan from land tax, 40 billion yuan from income tax, 30 billion yuan from inheritance tax, 132 billion yuan from commodity tax, 70 billion yuan from customs duties, and 100 billion yuan from revenue from enemy and puppet assets.</p>
<h3>Market News in Brief</h3>
<p>Weaving mills producing 12-pound fine white cloth are actively resuming production. However, due to prolonged shutdowns, machinery has been damaged, and repairs are time-consuming, resulting in low production volume. Strong demand further exacerbates the situation.</p>
<p>Large quantities of dyes such as San Seng Yuan [transliteration], 833 Dantu Yuan [transliteration], black indigo powder, Shuang E Yuan [transliteration], and sodium sulfide are being absorbed by Tianjin and Hankou merchants, causing the market price to show a firm trend. However, customers are generally setting strict price limits, resulting in lower trading volume compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>Raw silk prices have risen along with the gold market, boosting confidence and strengthening the market. Wealthy households are actively purchasing high-grade factory silk, and silk fabric factories continue to procure supplies.</p>
<p>Cigarettes show a weakening trend, especially those produced by Yizhong. Lao Dao [transliteration] fell below 6,000 yuan in the afternoon. The prices of Chinese-made cigarettes vary.</p>
<p>Knitted goods show a slight downward trend in market prices. 32-count socks, ten-five socks, health shirts, and Queen health shirts have become popular items, with prices rising across the board.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Announces Next Year's Business Policy</h3>
<p>According to Xu Baiyuan, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank: (1) Regarding the Central Bank's business plan, the Central Bank's mission is to regulate finance, and the current work is proceeding according to the original policy. (a) Expedite the settlement of maturing gold savings; (b) Reduce exchange rates in recovered areas as much as possible; (c) Support commercial banks in operating legitimate businesses and provide banks with low exchange rates. The business plan for the next year has been completed and is being submitted to the highest authorities for approval. (2) Regarding the issue of revising foreign exchange rates, the highest authorities have an overall decision, and it is not convenient to announce it until it is mature. Whether the foreign exchange business will be handled by the Central Bank or divided among national banks is also unknown. (3) Supporting commercial banks in handling remittances has also begun. The exchange rate is 4%, and 20 excellent firms in Chongqing have been designated, each allowed to provide 100 million yuan of funds per week. The application requirements are: (a) having branches in Shanghai; (b) not engaging in speculation. This will facilitate financial communication between the two places and benefit the vitality of Chongqing's finance. (4) Regarding the establishment of institutions by the Central Bank in Northeast China and Taiwan, the primary goal is to stabilize the existing conditions in these areas. (a) The exchange rate between Northeast China currency and legal tender will be announced after the price levels in Northeast China and North China are balanced. (b) Remittances between Taiwan and the mainland will be temporarily handled using foreign exchange methods. (5) Regarding overseas remittances, in addition to the Bank of China actively clearing them, the Central Bank has allocated 7 billion yuan in funds to the Bank of China to clear backlogs. Since the victory, overseas remittances have increased sharply, to about 10 million US dollars per month. The Central Bank will adjust funds as appropriate to expedite the provision of overseas remittances, allocating approximately 5 billion yuan in national currency per month. The methods of transporting cash are: (a) overland from Chongqing; (b) by sea from Shanghai, both concentrated in Guangzhou for distribution.</p>
<p>Overseas Remittance Statistics</p>
<p>The Bank of China handles overseas remittances, and the figures are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>October Income Cumulative Amount for Ten Months</p>
<p>USD 5,467,000 13,491,000</p>
<p>GBP 67,000 2,184,000</p>
<p>INR 20,000 444,000</p>

<h3>Sichuan Provincial Assembly Passes Several Educational and Economic Proposals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 26th] The Sichuan Provincial Assembly has extended its session three times due to the large number of proposals. Among the important proposals passed by the assembly in recent days, those related to education include the establishment of a university in southern Sichuan, the establishment of a university in northwestern Sichuan, the establishment of a university or vocational school in northern Sichuan, the establishment of the Northern Sichuan Agricultural College, and the establishment of a university district in Yibin.

<h3>Sun Lianzhong Concerned About Out-of-School Youths in North China</h3>
<p>Invites Relevant Agencies to Discuss Seven Measures</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] The relief of unemployed and out-of-school youths in various parts of North China has become an important issue in the reconstruction work. The Ministry of Education originally planned to provide relief to 10,000 youths nationwide, with 1,000 allocated to the Tianjin-Beiping area. Based on the actual situation, the number of unemployed and out-of-school youths in need of relief is much larger, far exceeding the 1,000 quota. Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the Eleventh War Zone, is extremely concerned about this issue. At 1:00 PM on the 26th, he specially invited representatives from education and other agencies to discuss relief measures, deciding on the following: (1) The relief quota is tentatively set at 5,000; (2) The required food will be discussed and allocated by the Tianjin-Beiping Municipal Government and the Hebei Provincial Government; (3) The required coal will be solicited from various coal mines by special commissioners of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (4) The required salt will be allocated by the Commander's Office; (5) Clothing will be borrowed from the Commander's Office; (6) The Relief Sub-Bureau will request the General Bureau to allocate relief supplies for 5,000 youths; (7) During the winter break for students in Tianjin-Beiping schools, the Youth League will prepare a plan for students in need of relief and submit it to the Central Youth Headquarters to organize a winter camp.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Formulates Principles for the Reinstatement of National Middle Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing] Regarding the reinstatement of national middle schools, the Ministry of Education has formulated several principles: (1) National middle schools will generally be handed over to the provinces and cities for management; (2) National middle schools with special circumstances will remain national for the time being. The location of the schools will be determined by the Ministry of Education; (3) In remote provinces with limited human and financial resources, where it is usually impossible to establish many excellent middle schools, the original national middle schools will continue to operate temporarily. National vocational schools and normal schools will remain in their original provinces or be relocated to suitable provinces for experimentation and environmental needs and will remain national for the time being.</p>
<h3>Shanxi University Resumes Classes in Hancheng This Month on the 24th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th] National Shanxi University began its reinstatement after the liberation of Taiyuan. However, it was delayed for several months due to the destruction of the railway by the Communist army. It has been reported that the school resumed classes in Hancheng, Shaanxi, on the 24th.</p>
<h3>The Dispute Over the Property of the Puppet Central University Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>Central University and Jinling University Each Gets What it Wants</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] A dispute arose between the Central University's Nanjing Office Receiving Committee and Jinling University regarding the receiving of assets from the puppet Central University. The reason is that many of the assets and equipment of the puppet Central University were taken from Jinling University. Jinling University believed that since Jinling University and Central University have always been friendly, Central University could donate all the equipment to Jinling University. However, some of the equipment belonged to the former Central University, and some were added by the puppet Central University. Donating all of it was impossible. Moreover, the government designated Central University to receive the assets. In terms of law, Central University could have ignored Jinling University's request. Therefore, after repeated discussions, out of consideration for personal relations and past friendship, a solution was finally reached. All furniture and books were returned to Jinling University. The surveying instruments of the Department of Civil Engineering, the instruments and medicines of the Medical College's Hygiene Room, and the equipment for music and art were all received by Central University.</p>
<h3>Educational Losses in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Over 334 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 27th] The investigation into the property losses of primary and secondary schools and social education institutions in this province during the Anti-Japanese War has been completed by the Department of Education.

<h3>North China Educational Receiving Work: 36 Receiving Institutions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] The educational receiving work in Tianjin and Beiping has largely been completed. Henan Province is now beginning to receive. The personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Education for the educational receiving work in Hebei and Shandong Provinces will soon depart. There are 230 registered unemployed education personnel, who have been screened and employed by the review authorities. Special Commissioner Shen said: The institutions received by this office can be divided into three categories, totaling 36: (1) There are 17 educational administration and cultural institutions, including the Xinmin Printing House, which the Executive Yuan ordered to be taken over by the Ministry to rush print the Three Principles of the People and the nationally determined textbooks for primary and secondary schools to meet urgent needs. The Palace Museum, the History Museum, the Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office, and the North China Observatory have all been reinstated. Losses of antiquities include the removal of more than 60 bronze vats from the Palace Museum, which are currently being investigated. (2) There are 5 libraries, such as Tsinghua, Yenching, the Beiping Research Institute, the Beiping Library, and the Political Science Association, which were plundered by puppet organizations. This office is working to clear and return them. This work is confusing and complicated, and very heavy. (3) There are 14 puppet schools, including the North China Administrative College, which has been dissolved. Peking University and Central University have merged to form a temporary university preparatory class.</p>
<h3>Educational Comrades in Distress Organize a Friendship Association</h3>
<p>[Our City News] More than 100 education workers in this city engaged in anti-Japanese war education during the war, who remained unyielding despite threats and inducements from the enemy and puppets, have organized the Educational Comrades in Distress Friendship Association. The association's address is No. 107, Lane 591, Nanjing West Road.

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Formulates Measures to Reorganize Private Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has recently formulated the "Provisional Measures for Reorganizing Private Vocational Schools and Vocational Supplementary Schools" as follows: (1) The registration and inspection measures for private vocational schools and vocational supplementary schools in this city are the same as those for secondary schools. (2) Unless otherwise specified in these measures, the "Provisional Measures for Reorganizing Private Secondary Schools" of this bureau shall apply to all private vocational schools and vocational supplementary schools in this city. (3) Private vocational schools that have already started operating without registration should complete the registration procedures in accordance with the law. However, to save procedures for schools that meet the prescribed standards, the procedures for the school board's registration, requesting approval to start operating, and requesting registration can be combined into one. (4) Private secondary schools that have already started operating without registration and want to change to vocational schools may also apply the provisions of the preceding article. (5) Private vocational supplementary schools that have already started operating without filing should complete the filing procedures in accordance with the law. (6) When registering a private vocational school, if it does not meet the standards due to limited environment and economic equipment, the bureau may first approve its registration and at the same time set a time limit for it to gradually improve the equipment. (7) This bureau may specially agree to allow public industrial institutions to allow private vocational schools and vocational supplementary schools to send staff and students for internships. (8) If there are technical or administrative difficulties in preparing a private vocational school's internship factory, it may request the bureau for assistance. (9) Private vocational schools or vocational supplementary schools with excellent performance and financial difficulties may request subsidies. (10) When students from private vocational schools or vocational supplementary schools graduate, they may request this bureau to forward letters to various public and private industrial institutions to employ them as much as possible. (11) These measures have been passed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education's committee meeting and will be implemented. (Yuan)</p>
<h3>Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament: Two Group A Games Today; Donghua vs. Shantou Team; Green Forest vs. Desheng</h3>
<p>The Morning Friends Cup Group A tournament will feature two games as usual, starting at 5:30 PM today. Although they may not be particularly exciting, the game between Donghua and Shantou is particularly attractive. The China Youth authorities, in view of this, have considered raising ticket prices.</p>
<p>The first game today is between Green Forest and Desheng. The former's attacking power has been reduced due to the injury of Chen Zhengsen. Although newcomer Hou Xueshi has joined the team, it is ultimately a losing proposition. Desheng should be able to win if they can field a full team.</p>
<p>Donghua and Shantou have similar styles, so they will fight fire with fire, and the clash will be fierce, making for a very watchable game. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Green Forest - Desheng (Group A) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Donghua - Shantou (Group A) 6:30 PM</p>
<h3>Standing Committee to be held. Basketball Committee Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Basketball Committee of the Municipal Sports Association is scheduled to hold its second standing committee meeting at You Yi Cun, Nanjing West Road, at 6:00 PM tomorrow (the 29th). It is reported that important matters will be discussed. Chairman Qian Xucang has several new plans to promote the comprehensive development of basketball in this city.</p>
<h3>A Plea for Children's Education</h3>
<p>— Lu Dianyang</p>
<p>After the Anti-Japanese War, textbooks in the rear areas were mostly printed on locally produced paper. The paper quality was poor, and the printing was blurry. Even in the first grade of elementary school, the font, although large, was still unclear, and the illustrations were even uglier, making them unrecognizable, let alone enjoyable. Children in the rear areas read books printed on rough paper under dim vegetable oil lamps, and their eyes suffered significant damage after a few years. During the Aviation Committee's recruitment of new students, many young people failed the eye test. What a great sacrifice for the country!</p>
<p>Now that the war has ended victoriously, elementary schools in the rear areas are still using textbooks printed on rough paper. This is unreasonable. It is true that transportation has not yet been restored, and newspapers have not yet been transported to the rear areas, so elementary schools have no choice but to continue using textbooks printed on rough paper this semester. But what about next semester? I am afraid that children in the rear areas will not be able to enjoy textbooks printed on white paper next semester! We cannot but cry out for the education of children in the rear areas! Please save the children in the rear areas, and reduce the tonnage of cigarettes and cosmetics transported by river and replace it with white paper to Chongqing, dedicated to printing elementary school textbooks.</p>
<p>As for the recovered areas in the southeast, they have always used white paper to print textbooks, and children have never seen textbooks printed on rough paper, so it seems that there is no problem. However, after some investigation, it was found that textbooks are also in short supply in the recovered areas. As a result, some elementary schools still use enemy and puppet textbooks, and some use pre-war teaching materials or supplementary teaching materials, all of which are not suitable for the children's education in the new China. The United Publishing House, which is dedicated to supplying nationally determined textbooks, is suffering from not getting enough newspaper to print textbooks. It is said that there are many newspapers in the sealed warehouses in Shanghai, which are distributed to various newspapers and magazines for use, but the United Publishing House has not yet received any of these newspapers. It is said that the paper they use to print nationally determined textbooks is purchased from the black market at high prices, which will undoubtedly affect the quantity and timing of printing. Moreover, the cost of booksellers increases, and the price of books cannot be reduced, which will increase the burden on children. What about this semester, and what about next semester? I am afraid that even though many arms are long, children in the recovered areas may not be able to enjoy official-price white paper textbooks next semester. We cannot but cry out for the education of children in the recovered areas: Please save the children in the recovered areas, do not forget them, and do not let them read enemy and puppet textbooks again. The newspapers sealed in the warehouse should be distributed to the publishers printing nationally determined textbooks as soon as possible, limited to printing nationally determined elementary school textbooks, publishing books on schedule, and reducing the selling price. It is said that in the past, the enemy and puppets gave priority to "allocating" newspapers to print textbooks. Could it be that the current authorities do not attach as much importance to children's education as the enemy and puppets did? I think it will never be the case.</p>
<p>It is said that there are not many newspapers in stock in Shanghai, but the demand for textbooks is extremely high. Therefore, to cure the root cause, we believe that the government should help publishers order large quantities of newspapers from abroad, provide official exchange rates, reduce import tariffs, approve priority transportation, and then distribute them to various districts to print elementary school textbooks (the number of elementary school textbooks is fixed, and paper is allocated according to the planned number of copies, so there will be no corruption). In this way, the price of textbooks can be greatly reduced, and it will definitely be effective in promoting national education. The country seems to be worth doing this work related to children's education.</p>
<p>Who doesn't have children, and who doesn't hope that children will get beautiful, clear, and affordable textbooks? I am sure that this small suggestion of mine will receive the sympathy and support of relevant people and will be realized in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>British Insurance Company Statement: Scope of Responsibility to Policyholders; Regulations Applicable to Contracts During Enemy Occupation Periods to be Considered</h3>
<p>This city's dispatch from the British Information Office: British insurance companies have issued a statement clarifying the handling of insured individuals in enemy-occupied territories during wartime. Shanghai has received this statement, which outlines the following principles:</p>
<p>(1) "Enemy-occupied territory" refers to areas that have never been at war with Britain but are designated as enemy territory under the "Trading with the Enemy Act" or similar legislation, or that are under enemy occupation even without such formal designation.</p>
<p>(2) "Technical enemies" refers to any individual or entity (whether incorporated or unincorporated) residing in enemy-occupied territory. The above statement applies only to fire, marine, aviation, and general insurance.</p>
<p>Insurance contracts are not considered void simply because the parties involved are "technical enemies," except as limited by the following provisions:</p>
<p>First, if the insured item is goods, those goods must never have been shipped to any government, individual, or company hostile to the United Kingdom or its allies, nor must they have become the property of such a government, individual, or company at any time during transport.</p>
<p>Second, losses or legal claims arising from capture, detention, restriction, or seizure by the United Kingdom or any allied government will not be covered by the insurance.</p>
<p>Third, if the insurance has been transferred to another insurance company, the British insurance company is released from its liability from the date of transfer.</p>
<p>Fourth, agreements signed in the United Kingdom during the enemy occupation will remain valid. However, the legal status of new contracts concluded within the occupied territory during the occupation period will be carefully considered by the company.</p>
<h3>Rickshaws on Nanjing Road to Resume Operation This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, considering Nanjing Road a vital city thoroughfare with heavy traffic, previously decided to prohibit all vehicles except automobiles and trams to avoid danger. However, since its implementation, this has affected the business of shops on Nanjing Road. Recently, upon the suggestion of Mr. Pan Gongzhan and Mr. Xi Yushu, the Municipal Government adopted a measure to allow all tricycles, bicycles, and rickshaws to operate from 2:00 PM to midnight daily, starting today. All relevant departments have been ordered to comply.</p>
<h3>Supervising Inspector Cheng Concerned About People's Livelihood; Suggests Troops Should Not Directly Occupy People's Homes, and a Fundamental Solution to Local Finances Should be Expedited</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu District Supervising Inspectorate dispatched multiple investigators to various areas of Jiangnan in the middle of this month. According to their reports, troops stationed along the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line mostly occupy civilian homes and borrow kitchens, causing disturbance to residents despite generally disciplined conduct. Supervising Inspector Cheng, concerned that this situation could negatively impact the public's respect for the national army, urgently recommended improvements to maintain good military-civilian relations. He suggested to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Third War Area Command that, regarding troop accommodation, the county government should oversee the selection of housing, working with local officials, regardless of the duration of stay. Furthermore, the county government should designate an agency to handle the procurement of supplies needed by the troops, who should liaise with the county government upon arrival, avoiding direct occupation of civilian homes to prevent disturbances. Additionally, according to recent investigations by the Supervising Inspectorate, the materials and expenses required for the area pacification measures decided by the Jiangsu Province Security Conference, such as road construction, telephone installation, bridge restoration, bunker construction, establishment of Baojia system, and census taking, all are derived from local support. Local areas are also providing food for troops, and are directed to procure goods before the military station arrives. Administrative personnel have no travel funds. Supervising Inspector Cheng believes the burden on the people in Jiangsu Province counties has been increasing since their recovery, with unlimited assessments. The above pacification expenses, nominally from local support, are actually burdens on the people. He specifically suggested to the Supreme National Defense Council that local funding should not be lightly ordered until the uses have been presented for approval. He also asked the central government to be considerate of the people's plight, and to expedite a fundamental solution to local finances in the next year, to give respite to the people of Jiangsu and lay the foundation for local administration.</p>
<h3>Hawaiian Version of U.S. Dollar Bills Should Not Be Devalued</h3>
<p>Hawaiian version U.S. dollar bills are widely circulated in this city, but money changers intentionally suppress their value, reducing the exchange rate by two percent compared to regular U.S. dollar bills. This came to the attention of the U.S. military finance office at Ford Island. Yesterday, they issued a notice stating that the Hawaiian version U.S. dollar bills have the same value as other U.S. dollar bills, and U.S. military and civilians should not transact with anyone deliberately devaluing them.</p>
<h3>Electricity Rate Increase Under Consideration</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] It was recently learned from relevant parties that the issue of increasing electricity rates in the city is still under consideration. Although the Shanghai Power Company submitted a request to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities earlier this month to adjust electricity prices, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently in charge of electricity administration. Therefore, all electricity administration measures are subject to comprehensive discussion to facilitate reasonable adjustments. Currently, the Shanghai Power Company needs 700 tons of coal and approximately 350 tons of oil daily to maintain power generation. Due to the high prices and difficult sources of fuel, the cost is enormous, making it difficult for the company to balance its income and expenses. To consider the facts, the authorities may adjust the rates. Reportedly, the authorities intend to maintain the original price of 12 yuan per kilowatt-hour for ordinary small users within the old limit of 10 kilowatt-hours. However, the electricity rates for industrial and general electric heating, which account for 70-80% of the city's electricity consumption, may be adjusted appropriately to provide financial support. It is also rumored that the company initially required an average of four pounds of coal to generate one kilowatt-hour during the early stages of resumption. Now, with improved machine maintenance, the amount of coal required to generate one kilowatt-hour has been reduced to slightly less than three pounds. Therefore, if fuel supply improves, the adjustment of electricity prices may not be too significant. Furthermore, the company has implemented an additional security deposit starting this month. The amount of the fee is based on each household's electricity consumption, roughly equivalent to the electricity bill for the past month plus 50%. It is said that the purpose of this additional security deposit is to ensure that users pay their bills on time. The company requires one and a half months from meter reading and sending bills to users paying their outstanding electricity fees before the deadline.

<h3>Tram Company Labor Dispute Still Under Negotiation</h3>

Thirty-one workers' representatives gathered the day before yesterday to discuss concrete measures, planning to submit a request to the company's authorities.

The current minimum base salary for workers is only about 10 yuan, a difference of more than one and a half times, so there is still room for negotiation.

<h3>The Origins of the Death of a Gambler in a Gambling Den on Rue Ratard</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yu Xunren, director of the Changning Police Precinct on Rue Paul Henry Brénan, received a tip at approximately 9:30 PM the night before last that No. 49 Kangfuli, a branch of Rue Ratard, was a gambling den (commonly known as a "Yellow Ox Pen"). He ordered the police to investigate and bust the den, during which a gambler was shot and killed, as reported in our newspaper. According to those in charge, the residents there are all local thugs, most of whom do not engage in legitimate work and live off smoking and gambling. Their gambling dens are particularly cunning, often moving several times a night, making it difficult for the police to bust them. The night before last (the 25th), after receiving a tip, he immediately ordered Judicial Section staff member Xu Xianzong to lead four plainclothes police officers and six armed police officers to the scene in a police car. First, he ordered the plainclothes police officers to blend in with the gamblers and enter the den. They then arrested all 18 gamblers along with the gambling equipment and funds and escorted them onto the police car at the Yuangfang Lane entrance. Unexpectedly, Xu A-Si was grabbed by Xu Section staff member Xu and pulled forward. When he reached the lane entrance, the suspect turned around and suddenly struck his right arm, snatched his official pistol, and dragged Xu into the lane, causing Xu to injure his right hand. He then called for his companions for assistance and took out his pistol, accidentally triggering the mechanism. A shot rang out, hitting A-Si in the rear arm, piercing his right waist, and causing him to fall to the ground bleeding. He died shortly after being sent to the hospital. According to reports, the deceased, Xu A-Si, was actually Qian Ai-Chu, a local resident, 45 years old, and a well-known local thug and disciple of Zhu Shunlin. He had committed numerous crimes in the jurisdiction and had a record of them. Furthermore, the 18 gamblers arrested were not good citizens and have been sent to the District Procuratorate for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Zhoujiazui Road Wasteland: Japanese Corpse Discovered; Murderer Takagi Tadashi Arrested and Confesses</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At approximately 7:50 AM on the 20th, the Tilanqiao Police Station received a report from Japanese national Ota Yoshihei, stating that a Japanese corpse had been discovered on the wasteland behind the back door of No. 19, Lane 416, Zhoujiazui Road. Section Chief Zhang and Deputy Section Chief Wang Xiweng immediately led Justice Section Chief Shi Rongrong to investigate. The investigation determined that the deceased had indeed been strangled. However, the body was not covered in mud, and the feet were without shoes, leading to the conclusion that the body had been moved. There were no belongings on the deceased, only a tattered piece of paper in his pocket, which read "Yamamoto Sadaji, residing at No. 12, Lane 144, Huoshan Road." They proceeded to the address for investigation. According to Yamamoto, the piece of paper was indeed written by him, but he claimed to have forgotten to whom he had given it. Yamamoto was then taken to identify the body, and it was learned that the deceased was a former captain of the "puppet China Shipping Company," but the surname and address were unknown. After extensive investigation by the police station, it was discovered that the deceased's name was Matsushita Tokio, aged forty, residing at No. 3, Xinkang Li, Wuchang Road. A search of his residence revealed that it was empty, leading to the conclusion that this was a murder for gain. A Japanese neighbor, Miyake Uta, was brought back for questioning, and she stated that at 3:30 PM on the 19th, a Japanese man, aged approximately twenty, holding a wine bottle, had come to visit Matsushita, who invited him to dinner. She claimed to know nothing further. It was then discovered that a Japanese man named Harada, residing at No. 3, Dexing Fang, Dong Changzhi Road, seemed to be holding items of clothing, etc., for someone. Investigation revealed two leather suitcases containing Matsushita's suit and captain's uniform hat, etc. According to Harada, a friend named Takagi Tadashi had come to deposit them at 7:00 PM that evening, and he said that Takagi Tadashi, aged about twenty-three or twenty-four, lived at No. 40, Xin'an Fang, Huimin Road. Based on this, the murderer seemed to be Takagi Tadashi. Officers were dispatched to the address, and according to his roommate, Japanese national Minami Taiichi, Takagi had a fondness for alcohol and women, and his character was immoral. At approximately 1:00 PM on the 19th, he had returned home once, holding a woman's black leather boot containing a large amount of counterfeit money. At the same time, he had told him that if anyone came looking for him, he should pretend that he had already moved. It was determined that the murderer was indeed Takagi Tadashi. Three photos of Takagi were found in the room. Officers were stationed at both locations, while detectives were dispatched to entertainment venues and restaurants. At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a report was received that someone resembling Takagi Tadashi was drinking at the Yatuan Cafe at No. 172, Xingjiaqiao Road. Justice Section Chief Shi personally led police officers to arrest him. He confessed that he and the deceased, Matsushita, had both been employees of the China Shipping Company, and that due to financial difficulties, he had strangled him and used a three-wheeled vehicle to move the body to the wasteland behind the back door of No. 19, Lane 416, Zhoujiazui Road. The police station is now rigorously interrogating him to determine if he had any accomplices or other illegal activities.</p>

Yesterday at approximately 3:30 PM, a man named Jia, from Jiangwan, was chatting in her room when Zhang arrived. Upon seeing the situation, he was consumed by jealousy and became enraged. He asked Meigeng if she was going out, and she replied that she was not. Zhang then took out two packets of white powder from his pocket and swallowed them. He then pulled out a sharp blade and, without explanation, stabbed her head and face several times. Meigeng was injured and fled to the home of Chen Chunbao on the second floor of the back building. Zhang Jinfu followed her and rushed inside, continuing to stab her arms and other areas more than ten times, severing two fingers on her right hand, causing profuse bleeding. A customer in the room was also stabbed in the head and immediately went to seek medical attention. Meigeng's sister, Mao'er, was also stabbed twice in the right hand.

<p>Medical Equipment Will Continue to Be Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Post-war medical care plays a very important role in China's relief plan.

As of yesterday, only 215 tons of medical and health equipment had arrived in Shanghai, and a large quantity will continue to be shipped to China. Recently, smallpox has been prevalent in Hankou. The Relief Administration transported 300,000 doses of smallpox vaccine from Shanghai and Chongqing to Hankou a month ago to prepare for it. However, the general public is accustomed to thinking that smallpox is only prevalent in the spring, and there is no need to vaccinate in the winter. In fact, the season in which smallpox is most likely to be prevalent is autumn and winter, thus evolving into the current situation in Hankou. The administration hopes that the general public will correct their mistaken views and get vaccinated voluntarily to avoid the spread of disease. According to recent news, diphtheria has been discovered in Guangdong, but the number is small. The Relief Administration has transported 100 doses of diphtheria serum to Guangdong for emergency relief. Penicillin has also begun to be distributed, and its distribution policy is: 1. Hospitals or institutions that receive penicillin from the Relief Administration must not charge patients when using it. 2. It must not be used to treat venereal diseases. 3. After use, doctors must report the process of use to the administration.</p>

<h3>"Moonlight Sonata" and Appreciation of Music</h3>
<p>— Song Shouchang</p>
<p>Works of art, such as paintings and sculptures, have physical forms that exist in space and can be appreciated through sight or touch. Various comparisons can be made from the lines, shapes, colors, and composition, causing a resonance in the heart. Music is not like this. The materials that constitute it are only vast and empty sounds, cleverly connected to express thoughts and feelings in a direct and unrestrained way, unconstrained by objective or specific images. Therefore, music has become an elusive art. This special abstractness of art is unique to music in all the arts.</p>
<p>There is also music that imitates natural sounds, but the description of objective phenomena is ultimately of low interest. Therefore, there is "program music" that combines objective and subjective descriptions. More advanced is pure subjective descriptions, such as psychological descriptions and dramatic descriptions. Works such as "symphonic poems," "tone poems," and "musical dramas" can be used, all of which are expressions of the author's silk-like inner self. If we want to understand the content of music, we should imagine it with our own emotions and subjectivity.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take the world’s most popular "Moonlight Sonata." This music was originally dedicated by Beethoven to his lover Guilette, and the content depicts the anxiety and illusion of passionate love. In order to arouse the public’s interest in music, the publisher deliberately titled this music "Moonlight." In order to explain the content of the music, a story was created, saying that one night, Beethoven was walking in the suburbs, and a blind rural woman was playing the piano under the moonlight by the window. Beethoven described the scene under the moonlight and played this music. Under the suggestion of this title, when we listen to the Moonlight Sonata, it seems that we are in the moonlight.</p>
<p>The first movement of the Moonlight Sonata is slow, with a hazy mood, like the first rise of the moonlight; the second movement is brisk, suggesting clarity, like the bright moon hanging in the sky; the last movement is rapid and intense, like a midnight storm. The publishing industry titled it "Moonlight," which seems to barely conform to the content of the music. However, the modern Russian musician Rubinstein criticized the inappropriate title of the Moonlight Sonata. He believed that the expression of moonlight should be hazy, dreamy, peaceful, and calm in order to conform. The first movement of the Moonlight Sonata is completely sad, and the last movement is in violent passion, which is contrary to the peaceful and calm mood of the moonlight.</p>
<p>Regarding the Moonlight Sonata, some say that it was inspired by the clumsy poem "Praying Virgin" by Zoimei. Czerny once heard the Moonlight Sonata as a nocturne of ghosts appearing. Cornelius once heard the Moonlight Sonata as a description of the Gothic Church. These associations are not impossible. Because music is the abstract and inner expression of the author, when we listen to music, what our feelings are and what we associate with is everyone’s freedom.</p>
<h3>Gorky's "The Lower Depths"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Ke Lingshi's adaptation and translation of Gorky's "The Lower Depths" has been directed by Zuo Lin and performed at the Lafayette Theater for several days. This is a good play after "The Circus." Jin Buhuan and Murong Tianxi are equally unpromising, and still played by Shi Hui. Shi Yuan still plays a role who likes to tell jokes with a giggle. (I think maybe it was in "Qiu Haitang") I remember seeing Lin Zhen's play in a play that insinuated Yuan Shikai. I have a deep impression of her fighting with another fat woman on stage. Zhang Fa is probably still playing the leading young man, just like in "The Circus." Su Qin seems to have been seen in "The Legend of the Eight Immortals". In short, almost all the people I saw on stage were familiar people. I have been away from Shanghai for two years, and when I come back, I still see the Kugan Drama Society continue to work hard. This spirit is really admirable. I heard that in the past few years, I have written dozens of play reviews, most of which were published under the pen name Zou Xiao in the Shenbao Recreation World. Because I took an attitude of appreciation, said more good things, gave more encouragement, and didn't criticize much, I was ridiculed as a "well-rounded play reviewer." But I have to state that I am an honest person, and everything I say comes from the bottom of my heart. I said what I wanted to say. "The Lower Depths" is the first drama I saw after returning to Shanghai, and I am now writing a seemingly right but actually wrong play review.</p>
<p>Danny played Dr. Ding in "Metamorphosis," and I once cheered for her. Her play moved me to tears, and I hope to take a section and include it in the Mandarin textbook. This time I am worried about her. How can such a gentle maternal woman play a hysterical woman? As a result, it was beyond my expectation that she succeeded. Naturally, the actions she showed, using the scarf to quickly tighten and release it, reminded me of "Carmen" (written by French Merimee) on the screen, as if she was a passionate Spanish woman; it also reminded me of "Salome" (written by British Wilde), and I always felt that it had a foreign flavor. But I have never seen what the actions of this type of Chinese woman are, so I can't say.</p>
<p>There is one place where I think the director did a very good job. That is when Ama is dying, Grandpa Quan tells her about the joys of heaven, saying that there will be someone to pick her up. At this time, Ama is holding Grandpa Quan's crutch, as if she has really been picked up to heaven. This suggestion strengthens my image. This crutch has replaced the glue, and such treatment is very clever.</p>
<p>Shi Tuo mentioned Sai Guanyin in his dedication, and he seemed to think that she was a poor person, and asked us to answer: "Why is she so cruel?" I think what he wants us to answer is his own words: "The power of society is greater, and they are thrown down deeper." But we don’t know what Sai Guanyin’s life was like before, for example, whether she was tricked into marrying or forcibly bought by Wen Taishi. Therefore, we only have disgust for her and no sympathy. Of course, Wen Taishi is the most annoying. But for Sai Guanyin, I can’t see her sadness, except for the pain of being in love and becoming neurotic as a result. What I mean is that her past should be recounted in a few sentences. What I like the most is Grandpa Quan. He has a heart of universal love and is enthusiastic about saving people. He knows that some things are superstitious or unreliable, but he is unwilling to break other people's dreams, but echoes them. Su Qin's performance is also excellent. There is also such a prophet in "The Circus" who tells fortunes (Xu Zhimo's "Bian Zhonggang" also has one), but not as lovely as Grandpa Quan.</p>
<p>Shi Tuo and Ke Ling's adaptation and translation have enough Chinese flavor. For example, it is most taboo to have someone reading a book behind you when playing card games, because the sound of "book" is the same as the sound of "lose." This is a kind of Chinese "taboo".</p>
<p>There is a passage in the play where Gao Xiaoou sings "Full of Grievances" in the opera "Selling Horses." The expression is very good and can express the state of pain, but the singing seems to lack the desolation.</p>
<h3>Short Notes</h3>
<p>— Lan Tian</p>
<p>Returning from the Theater</p>
<p>Coming out of the bustling theater, one can't help but feel a little dizzy. Thousands of people were immersed in the modern "sound" and "color," forgetting the cold air outside. At the time, these movies gave the audience an unparalleled feeling of excitement, but after thinking about it, it was all empty. Truly, it was the height of splendor, ultimately tending towards blandness.</p>
<p>Walking in the silky drizzle, endlessly lost.</p>
<p>Standing at the tram stop, gazing out at the people coming and going at the intersection, hurrying to come, hurrying to go. Where do they come from? Where are they going? Although the road wasn't too deserted, the streetlights were dim, making it feel quite desolate. In the distance, a tram arrived, bringing a glimmer of hope. But the tram was incredibly crowded, a strange sight – how could such a small vehicle fit so many people? I was about to wait for the next tram, but then I thought, wouldn't it be just as crowded? Besides, being squeezed in a crowd can somewhat dispel the overwhelming feeling of loneliness. (Imagine how pitiful I am!)</p>
<p>Returning home, the room was very cluttered. These things seemed familiar, yet also very distant. As I started to tidy them up, my movements would suddenly stop, and I would yearn for the state of this room not long ago. It was raining outside, and I thought of you, having to run to two places, feeling very uneasy.</p>
<p>Recently, Li Yi's lines of poetry seem to be very fashionable. I see them here and there. Just now, on the way, I suddenly recalled two lines: "Red buildings stand cold, glimpsed through rain, beaded blinds sway, returning alone." Very fitting to the surroundings. Actually, the following two lines are also good, but the tone is a bit too desolate. He says: "On a distant road, one should grieve the lateness of spring, in the lingering night, one still vaguely recalls dreams." Reading these more often cultivates my emotions to be more exquisite. Isn't it?</p>
<h3>I Sing of Jiangnan</h3>
<p>— Deng Lin</p>
<p>Jiangnan, this bright and beautiful water region of Jiangnan, has evoked so many memories and yearnings in people!</p>
<p>Jiangnan left me with rich spring dreams, and Jiangnan also left me with indelible traces. In my conscious memories, Jiangnan has given me much sorrow!</p>
<p>I remember gazing out from the majestic seaside. The vast sea's surging waves were so magnificent. Sometimes, the setting sun cast a sky full of evening glow, and the mountainside shimmered with shades of purple and emerald. Soft clouds floated over the mountain peaks, capturing the reflected, dazzling rays of light and carrying them towards the misty void, towards the vast expanse of water. At the edge of the sky, it left its last life behind, far away. Only the boundless sea still silently surged forward. From ancient times to the present, from the high mountains to the plains, it is always so silently, silently, harboring a full heart of ambition, passing the long, drawn-out night, even though the fleeting moment of light has abandoned it!</p>
<p>I remember gazing under the green curtains of bright lamps. On starry, moonlit nights, I imagined the future with my friends. The cold, beautiful orchids in front of the window emitted a faint fragrance. Where has it disappeared to now? Sometimes, the faint sound of a flute drifted from the lonely willow lanes, so melancholic and sad. Perhaps someone was yearning for the forging of life? Deep into the night, under the clear light of the bright moon, the cuckoos played a touching homesick tune, as if calling out to travelers in distant lands, "Better to return! Better to return!"</p>
<p>I also remember the ancient, gnarled pines on the small hills, and the maple leaves, as lush and vibrant as red flowers. How many people have wandered here, how many have smiled here. The post-calamity scenery must no longer be so beautiful! Perhaps thickets of wild weeds have replaced its former splendor. Eight years, eight years of devastation have buried countless tears of blood, and eight years of devastation have added countless lamentations!</p>
<p>I further remember the stream by the building, the pond by the embankment... Listening to the surging, angry sounds, the tides of the sea should still be a spectacle of the universe.</p>
<p>The car body speeds forward with a clattering sound, and the vast Jiangnan line reappears before my eyes. The vast sky, the towering green mountains... It is still young, only bearing a slight hint of excessive weariness!</p>
<p>The motherland's fields appear ahead. The sunlight illuminates the future, and Jiangnan begins a new life in its brilliance.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Beyond the Border (Rhyming)</h3>
<p>— Gu Yiqiao</p>
<p>Beautiful jade has long been nurtured, unintentionally seeking exploration. The white snow of the southern mountains accumulates in layered mists, snow water drawn into threads, threads of purity, mulberry trees spread across the land. Discussing past and present, facing the shadow, becoming three, a dream lightly dozing on the flat sands, for the dream of Jiangnan, seeking beyond the border, Jiangnan beyond the border.</p>
<h3>Obtaining Warmth</h3>
<p>— Wu Yiren</p>
<p>When the northwest wind assaults all the meager warm clothes one is wearing, one's whole body instantly loses its warmth. It seems that one's heart is also frozen there. At this time, how you long for a warm place to restore the warmth you have lost, and to revive your freezing heart! But you are wrong to have such hope. Those who enjoy warmth will never think of the pain of those who have lost warmth, because they themselves have never tasted the bitterness of losing warmth, so they will not understand those pains. Even if they know, they will only feel a very slight sentiment. Thus, the "sympathy" you hope for will be hoped for forever.</p>
<p>Friend! Waiting for the sympathy of others is unreliable. Everything depends on yourself. You must work hard yourself, to obtain warmth for your whole body, and to revive your frozen heart. You only have to run desperately, and desperately make your whole body active. Then, your blood will flow through your whole body, and even sweat will pour from your pores. At this time, the "warmth" you have been waiting for will come. That is warmth obtained by your own strength. It will not run away and will always be your own.</p>
<p>If, when you always hope for people to sympathize with you, you are lucky enough to be led to a warm place by someone sympathetic, and then your whole body gains warmth, but may I ask, can you stay there forever? If you cannot, then this warmth is only temporary and will still be lost when you leave.</p>
<p>Friend! "It is better to ask for help from oneself than from others." This is an old saying from the ancients: the only warmth is to strike it out from the motor you possess.</p>
<p>Only cold can stir up your courage to run,</p>
<p>Only hardship will strengthen your spirit of struggle.</p>
<p>Essays</p>
<h3>The Story of a Drawing</h3>
<p>— Murong Sui</p>
<p>It's been seven or eight years, not short, but not too long either! I used to be an elementary school teacher. Although the years have passed, I wasn't lonely. I feel like there were many "stories" worth remembering.</p>
<p>I'm not lying, I even served as a drawing teacher. I remember one day, I drew—originally intending to draw a tiger—a dog on the blackboard. Let's just say it was a dog! I had dozens of snot-nosed elementary school students copy it on their drawing pads.</p>
<p>But what was the result? When I collected the papers and carefully reviewed them, I found that only a few, two or three, of the dozens of papers had drawings that looked somewhat like a dog. What about the rest? Some looked like cows, some like pigs, some like rabbits, some like mice, some like... practically any four-legged animal had a place!</p>
<p>At the time, I just felt that these brilliant works, except for not one that "appropriately" resembled a tiger, could be considered a "grand spectacle," "a sight to behold!"</p>
<p>I began to realize that the development of talent should not be restricted, but should be encouraged to develop according to their "interests." So next time, I assigned a "topic" like this, telling them to draw a four-legged animal according to their imagination, any animal, as long as it had four legs!</p>
<p>But the result was truly beyond expectation. Although all the dozens of "works" were adorned with four legs, not one looked like an animal. Looking closely, some looked like "tables," some like "chairs"—at least they didn't forget the tail that an animal should have—I couldn't help but laugh a little at the time!</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, laugh? That would be a bit cruel. You should know that drawing an animal isn't an easy thing either!</p>

<h3>Map and Explanation of the Five Sacred Mountains, Eight Dynasties, Kunlun, and the Himalayas</h3>
<p>— Yuan Xiluo</p>
<p>In this map, the lower right shows a cypress tree planted by my ancestor, the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, more than 4,600 years ago. The left shows the scenery of Hainan Island, with coconut trees and tropical plants. Slightly above are three mountains arranged in a row. The left is Mount Li in Hainan, the middle is Mount Luofu in Guangdong Province, and below the mountain is a plum forest, symbolizing China's national flower. To the right is Mount Jigong, the location where the decision for the War of Resistance was made. In the pine forest is a temple-style building, the place for the meeting. Further above, five mountains are arranged in a row: Hengshan (North), Taishan (East), Songshan (Central), Huashan (West), and Hengshan (South), the Five Sacred Mountains of China, known as North, South, East, West, and Central. Further above, two mountains, one is Mount Kumgang in Korea, the mountain where Japan began its invasion of my tributary state in the Sino-Japanese War, and the other is Mount Emei in Sichuan, the mountain in the rear of my wartime capital, Chongqing. Further up, to the left is Mount Changbai in Manchuria, in the middle is Mount Tianshan in Xinjiang, and to the right is Mount Diancang in Yunnan. The mountain peaks are all above the perpetual snow line. At the top, to the left is Kunlun, and to the right is a high peak, the Himalayas, both showing their halves, all covered in snow. The sky above is painted with the blue sky and white sun, dyed with auspicious red clouds, as a symbol of my country's flag. The creation of this map is for my</p>
<p>Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, for leading our countrymen for eight years in the war of resistance against the Japanese army that invaded our country, to protect my Republic of China, completely intact, to comfort his hard work and great achievements. When I was thirty-one years old, I joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), following my</p>
<p>The late Premier Sun Yat-sen, running about for the revolution. In the autumn and winter of the Xinhai Revolution, I served as a representative of Jiangsu Province, organizing the Provisional Government of the Republic of China. Together with representatives from seventeen provinces, we elected Mr. Sun Yat-sen as the first President of the Republic of China. On the first day of the year, I, together with comrades Lin Zichao, Chen Taoyi, Wang Liangchen, Ju Juesheng, Ma Junwu, Wang Rutang, Wu Tiecheng, and gentlemen Lei Jixing, Gu Zhongxiu, and Qu Wenliu, bestowed the seal of the Great President upon Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At that time, we all joyfully danced and sang, thinking that my Republic of China would have great hope in the future. However, in less than two months, Mr. Sun Yat-sen ceded his position to Yuan Shikai. From then on, for more than ten years, Shikai's dictatorship lasted four years, and the warlords stole power for ten years. Mr. Sun Yat-sen struggled for forty years, but the revolution was not fully accomplished before his death. I deeply regret that I, as one of the old party members, was unable to help the revolution. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, after fourteen years, continued Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will and worked hard on the Northern Expedition to unify China. This is truly the first person of my party and country. Now, after eight years of bloody battle, he has placed the Republic of China among the world's four great allied nations. I know that the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in heaven will surely have something to comfort him, so I made this map to present to him. In my youth, I liked to make landscape paintings. After the age of thirty, I ran about in education and political work, and did not make this. I have stopped writing for nearly forty years. In 1938, I took refuge in Shanghai. I intended to go west with my old comrade, Chen Taoyi, to participate in the anti-Japanese work. Taoyi told me: The government today needs to gather talents from all sides to be effective in the war of resistance. If we go, we will occupy a position, and the government will have one less position to place talent. It is better to stay in Shanghai and not lower our aspirations, not insult our bodies, and be an example for the people in the occupied areas. Isn't that better than going to Chongqing? So we agreed not to move, and my brother Xilian also agreed with this decision. However, in less than three years, our funds were exhausted, and all three of us earned a living by selling books. Friends saw that I could paint in my youth and advised me to paint. So I took up the paintbrush again. In the autumn of 1943, I began to paint. At that time, I thought that the Himalayas were the highest mountain in my country and the highest mountain in the world, with hot, temperate, and cold climates. No Chinese painter had painted it before. I jokingly made several paintings to exchange for firewood and rice. At that time, thinking of the hard work of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the War of Resistance, I often made a painting to give to him on the day of his successful return to the capital. But the building where I lived was small, and there was no large painting table, so I could not make a large painting. So I bought a three-foot piece of silk in preparation. By May of this year, the world war was about to end, and it was predicted that the Chinese government would return to Nanjing in less than three months. So in mid-June, I started work. Also, because there are so many famous mountains in China, if I only painted one Himalayas, it would be monotonous, so I changed to make this map, painting the cypress tree planted by the Yellow Emperor, representing the national system of my country. Painting Kunlun as the source of all the mountains in my country. The Himalayas are the highest, also a branch of Kunlun. If we speak in terms of the symbolism of my party and country, then Kunlun is the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, and the Himalayas is Comrade Chiang Kai-shek. Painting Mount Kumgang is because Japan began its invasion of my country there, for the struggle of Korea. Now that Japan has been defeated, Korea has gained independence and will still be my eastern tributary. Painting the Five Sacred Mountains and other mountains to show the greatness of China, and also symbolizing the meritorious comrades of this War of Resistance. The brushwork sometimes follows Nangong (Mi Fu), sometimes follows Beiyuan (Dong Yuan), sometimes follows Ma Yuan, or imitates Xiangguang (Dong Qichang), while also referring to Western European watercolors. When the painting was completed, Chen Taoyi inscribed the words. Also, on the Double Seventh Festival of the year Yimao (1945), Mr. Yu Zhigan gave me a stone, tightly carved with a Liu Hai sprinkling gold coins ornament, with the inscription: "Peace under Heaven." That evening, Japan surrendered. So I instructed Zhu Fanru to carve the "Treasure Seal of Peace under Heaven" on the painting. Briefly record the intention of making the painting, written on another piece of paper at the top of the painting.</p>
<p>August, the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), Yuan Xiluo respectfully painted and recorded, at the age of seventy.</p>

<h3>Why Are Children Not Allowed Into Movie Theaters in This City?</h3>
<p>— Ruo Xuan</p>
<p>Movies are originally one of the legitimate entertainments for citizens, but the movie theaters in this city, in order to prevent children from developing bad habits, do not admit children under the age of ten. This reason always feels very forced. If it is really to prevent children from developing bad habits, then does that mean that children over the age of ten and adults will definitely not be affected after watching them? Moreover, the authorities have already established a film censorship committee, and any bad films that are obscene or promote theft can be banned from being shown at all. To stop eating because of choking is definitely not the way to go. At the same time, the Chinese and foreign films currently being shown in various theaters mostly promote the educational awareness of the War of Resistance and war stories. Children will not only not be harmed after watching them, but they can also increase their knowledge of war and make them aware of how cruel and unreasonable the enemy used to be. At the same time, it also makes us think that other countries do not have a ban on children entering movie theaters, and the bad habits of those children may not be as many as those of our children. For this reason, I hope that the authorities will immediately order all movie theaters to abolish the "rule that children are not allowed to enter."</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) It cannot be said that movie theaters have no reason to prohibit children from entering, because young children often cry and shout in the theater, which hinders the audience's hearing and public order. It should indeed be refused. I think it should be limited by the age of school entry, that is, children under the age of six are generally not admitted, and children over the age of six who have slightly opened their minds can be allowed to increase their new knowledge. I hope that the authorities and the movie theater industry can discuss this together.</p>

<h3>On Worry-Free Smoking Cessation (3)</h3>
<p>— Hu Qipeng</p>
<p>IV. The Damage of Drug Addiction to the Human Body</p>
<p>Those who use addictive drugs often experience the aforementioned withdrawal symptoms when the required amount is insufficient or stopped, causing unbearable pain and lifelong suffering, which is beyond description. At the same time, their bodies and minds are gradually damaged unconsciously. The most obvious is that digestive problems occur in the stomach and intestines, leading to habitual constipation, affecting the body's metabolism, resulting in malnutrition and muscle wasting. Eventually, they become completely addicted, their bodies emaciated, and the function of their reproductive organs also shows signs of weakening. Men suffer from impotence, and women suffer from irregular menstruation, lack of libido, and difficulty in conceiving (those who are promiscuous use the power of drugs to strengthen their yang, which is only the excitatory effect of the initial drug use, but eventually it will be ineffective). The nervous system and mental aspects are even more severely damaged, reducing the ability of mental activity, and over time, various personality changes occur, that is, emotional life becomes narrower, interests decrease, and moral concepts are gradually lost. They are hypocritical, deceitful, untrustworthy, and ignorant of righteousness, even sacrificing their status and reputation without hesitation. This kind of abnormal personality is completely caused by poisoning, cannot be suppressed, and is not even consciously recognized. Some even experience mental excitement, delusions, or toxic psychosis. As for those who become addicted to smoking due to illness, although the disease is temporarily masked by the anesthetic effect, the disease is not cured, so the disease often gradually increases in secret. Once it occurs, the anesthetic effect of the drug has lost its efficacy. To seek medical treatment again is too late. This is also the harm of using addictive drugs. Therefore, I consider the reason for using addictive drugs to stimulate, refresh, or treat illness and maintain life, resulting in daily physical loss, to be the same as living on debt and pawn for a living. Because over time, they will inevitably become more and more impoverished. The energy obtained from drugs is not the natural energy generated by diet and nutrition in physiology.</p>
