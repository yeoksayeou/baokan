<p>南京十一日中央社電　國府當局爲攙行戰時經濟施策，加强抑平物價，以安定民生起見，决採取斷然處置，訂定物價對策緊急措置，責成各地物價評議委員會加强組織，從嚴評價，幷由各地主管官署對於主要商品，應依法實施登記，幷厲行取締囤積，未經核准而任意提高售價者，决依法嚴處，同時對各同業公會會員未登記之主要商品，及一般市民購存超過自用數量之大批物資，嚴厲取締。此項緊急措置，實係針對目前各地物價上漲之原因而予以對症下藥，對囤積操縱者流實一錄頭棒喝，今後物價問題定可趨於穩定，民生賴以安定。陳行政院長昨特就此發表重要聲明，重申政府抑平物價安定民生决心，幷深盼全國商民切實遵行，盟邦駐華谷大使亦發表談話，披瀝對國府該項措置，决予全力協助。茲將該項措置全文及陳行政院長谷大使談話原文錄后：</p>
<p>物價對策緊急措置</p>
<p>（一）國民政府爲遂行戰時經濟施策，加强抑平物價，以安定民生起見，特訂定本措置。（二）主要商品同業公會，應將三十四年二月五日所屬商品當地批發及零售價格，向該管物價評議委員會據實呈報，此後未經核准，不得再任意提高，否則依法嚴處，物價評議委員會得查明其呈報價格，重予核定。（三）名地物價評議委員會應加强組織，從嚴評價。（四）各地主管官署對於主要商品應依法實施登記，及厲行取締囤積。（五）各主要商品同業公會應將第二條指定日期所屬商品存貨數量，迅向當地主管官署詳實呈報，以後幷按月呈報一次。（六）各地主管官署對於同業公會會員未登記之主要商品及一般市民購存之大批物資，超過自用數量者，均應嚴厲取締。前項自用數量，由各地主管官署另定之。（七）各地主管官署對於居間商之不法買賣行爲，應嚴加取締。（八）金融檢查組織應予加强，幷澈底檢查金融業務。（九）實施本措置時，各地主管官署應嚴防主要商品之逃避。（十）本措置自公布日施行。</p>
<p>陳院長談話</p>
<p>增强戰力，首重安定民生，其施策治本固以增加生產確立治安爲體，治標則以抑平物價統制物資爲用。爲期迅收實效，自應標本兼治，體用並施。溯自大東亞戰爭發生以來，政府對於增加生產確立治安，固已不斷努力，而於抑平物價統制物資，更列爲重點工作之一。三年以還，揹置設施，悉本此旨，總期隨時研究，得以平衡，市塲交易，漸趨合理，庶幾民生賴以安定，國家得以復興。惟最近物價依然高漲，影響民生，莫此爲甚，究其原因，雖由物資供求尙欠圓滑，而少數不良分子之貪圖私利，實爲物價狂漲之厲階。茲爲遂行戰時經濟施策安定民生起見，特於本日頒布物價對策緊急措置，指定二月五日之價格爲標準市價，於京滬兩地先行實施，此後各主要商品價格不得擅自提高，但確有調整之必要時，政府自當顧及實情，重予合理之核定。其有囤積居奇，意圖操縱，或藉金融之運用，助長囤風者，決從嚴懲處。至於物資來源，亦當設法疏通，以應當前之需要，希望商民咸能切實遵行，民生前途，實利賴之。</p>
<p>谷大使談話</p>
<p>中華民國國民政府前曾訂定確立治安肅正思想及增强生產三大政綱，力謀實現，關於增强生產一項，不僅於完攙大東亞戰爭上必要之戰力增强，抑且爲安定民生最重要之先决問題，實施以來，排除一切困難，强力推行各種施策，實深慶賀。日政府亦深信中國民生之安定，爲中國復興之前提，亦爲興亞不可缺少之條件，對於國民政府此等施策，不惜予以最大協力援助，我人之决意亦决戰前所發表之戰時經濟確立對策，更闡明政府自發表對華新政策以來，始終以不渝之决意，而期有以協力於中國各種施策之推進焉。</p>
<p>然國府雖具有上述方針，現尙有一部份人未能了解政府意旨，專事力求私利私慾，勃於貪汚阻害增强生產，給予多數民衆生活以威脅敗類，亦未絕跡，國府陳代主席於就職之訓詞中，曾披瀝决意，實現故在主席之廉潔政治，力言毒害人民危害國家者，不問爲任何人，皆作國賊論，國府誓必與民衆共同驅遂害賊。又最近周上海市長閣下亦曾闡明對於貪官汚吏曁投機奸商，决亳不假借，予以嚴懲，今番國民政府更爲促進中國經濟之戰力化，安定民生，决定物價緊急對策，以爲經濟政策之一環，於農歷新年將臨之前，斷然抑制物價不當高漲，彈壓囤積投機，確信中國全國國民必極表歡迎。</p>
<p>日本政府對於上項施策，除衷心表示贊成，並決適應中國方面之要求，在華軍官民一體對中國方面予以協力援助，而在本施策之推進時，中日兩國民間毫無差別不公平之待遇，日僑方面經營不正當營業者，亦決按律嚴厲取締處罰，尙希在華僑民諸君，善體國民政府之方針，協力日本政府，推進本施策。</p>

<h3 id="c9">三頭會議與歐局 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>最近歐洲戰爭形勢的演變，影響着反軸心方面英美諸國間的關係，是非常複雜。爲應付新戰爭形勢下的特殊局面，檢討有待解決的種種問題，二月初開始，反軸心羅邱史在黑海某地又舉行了一次會議，這是一九四三年十一月底德黑蘭會談以來他們第二次的共同見面。</p>
<p>他們的會談現已有好幾天，內容無從知悉。不過根據當前現實局面，各方所透露出來的消息，並就他們主觀的企圖加以推測，會談中心大致不出：（一）如何處理現行戰局，（二）如何對付德國，（三）如何劃分勢力範圍，（四）如何建立戰爭結束以後的國際關係。</p>
<p>這次會談，他們都是以主觀想法—歐洲即將結束做出發點的，以他們之間利益關係的複雜，根本矛盾的深刻，會談中面紅耳赤，糾紛極多，是必然的，所以不見得會有好的結果。</p>
<p>關於第一項如何處理現行戰局問題，這裏似還包含着幾種矛盾：一是蘇聯軍隊加速度的進展，已引起了英美的嫉忌，前次蘇軍迫近華沙時如此，今天蘇軍迫近柏林時更其如此，這一嫉忌或將影響他們在東西兩面有機的配合作戰。二是三國一面想從早結束戰爭，而另一面爲了戰爭一結束，他們之間的政治矛盾會立即深刻展開，或將比作戰更難處理，於是又躊躇起來。正如西班牙雅報記者所論：「反軸心國現在之畏懼和平，有如其從前之畏懼戰爭，因迭次延未解決的政洽問題，現又突趨緊迫」。三是戰爭早結束與否，並不能隨便由他們可以理想，蹤使蘇軍攻下柏林，戰事西移，德國仍可北自挪威丹麥南迄義大利境，以西部德國爲中心，繼續作戰，所以攻下柏林即以爲歐戰已可結束，實屬言之尙早。</p>
<p>第二項如何對德國問題，英美蘇曾一再宣言過，非德國無條件投降不可。但由於德國軍事力量的强靱，德國國民意志的堅毅，眞要德國無條件投降，實在太不容易。戰爭越到後來越艱困，而犧牲也越大，英美蘇現在都是外强中乾，爲想多少保持些元氣，贊不欲再作過大的消耗，所以很想于軍事以外加用政治手段來使德國屈服，從政治方面瓦解德國。倫敦開羅方面所透露三國將向德國人民發表聯合宣言，宣佈所謂「無條件投降」的條件和形式，實具有極微妙的作用。據說三國已暗示他們的目的，在於打倒希特勒國社黨德國，而並非爲欲毀滅德國人民的德國。這是英美蘇向德國人民誘降的把戲。可是上次大戰後協約國所加予德國的束縛，德國人民已經够受了，這次德國人民不會再上當。</p>
<p>第三項如何劃分勢力範圍問題，這簡直是最複雜的問題。這問題主要是從歐洲各小國爲對象，而分配勢力圈。一要使各小國在表面上還是維持獨立，二要把勢力分配得均衡，這實是不容易處理的事。目前蘇聯兵力所及，北起芬蘭，沿波羅的海經愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞，立陶宛三小國，再經中默的的波蘭，舊捷克斯拉夫，洪牙利，以迄巴爾幹的羅馬尼亞，保加利亞的大部或全部，再加進攻中的德國，及新成爲進攻目標的奧國等，大小達十個國境以上，而政治影響則兼希臘土耳其以至法國等國；英美方面，軍事勢力現僅及西歐的法國，荷蘭，比利時和德國的邊境及地中海的義大利，希臘。英美對蘇聯在歐洲軍事力從而政治力的强大，是非常畏懼，所以最近不僅暗鬥劇烈，明爭也時常顯露出來。若干國家於德國撤近後且有二個政府，依恃英美的倫敦流亡政府和蘇聯扶植起來的當地蘠時政府之間的爭持，正反映英美和蘇聯的鬥爭，波蘭情形更屬明顯。即如希臘的內亂，左翼愛拉斯團抗英，其實也即是英蘇的交鬨。顯然的，英美蘇的爭權奪利，隨着戰爭的演變，必愈趨愈甚。且不僅英美和蘇聯之間，即英國和美國之間，以至英美法之國，矛盾也是很多。</p>
<p>第四項如何建立戰爭結束以後的國際關係，這跟第三項有密切速繫。各國尤其英美和蘇聯間的矛盾旣如此深刻，所以在戰後要建立眞正能够協調的新國際機構，恐怕很難。同時，各國在經濟方面的合作，也不見得會有圓滿的成就。再所謂解放被迫小國，又必口惠而實不至的詐騙慣技。</p>
<p>綜上所述，這次三頭會議不會有多大的結果，是可以預料得到的，縱使有什麼結果，以後大家能否履行，也是疑問，不過，他們新的陰謀，却也不能不加以注意。歐局的演變，隨時會影響遠東，我們必須注視其發展。</p>

<p>邇來本市一般物價，仍有上漲趨勢，影響民生殊爲嚴重。經濟當局一再通令商民，對於評定限價務須切實遵照，乃有一般商人，乘農曆年關過渡之際，竟恣意抬價，漫無止境。市經濟局對於抑平物價，早具决心，茲爲採取緊急措置起見，時於昨日上午十一時在市商會大禮堂召集本市各同業公會代表，舉行臨時緊急談話會，計到有南貨，茶食，地貨，雜貨，華洋百貨，熱水，火腿，鮮肉，酒菜飯，雜糧餅饅，五金，人力車，切麵，　產，布廠，原蘇，西藥，製革，土菸，橡膠，水菓，百貨，鹹菜荳芽，呢絨，毛紡，工業油脂，車胎，樹柴，各業同業公會共一百餘單位代表。市經濟局長許江氏准時蒞會，親目出席訓話，說明本市物價高漲之嚴重，决定取緊急措置，希本市各業公會協助政府共謀抑平物價等語。最後由該局第三科長唐少川說明緊急措置辦法要點，直至下午一時始行散會。</p>
<p>許局長詞</p>
<p>本局長蒞任之始，即以抑平物價，安定民生，爲先務之急，務求實現，不尙空談。在此戰爭時期，物資供求偶不相應，因而物價變動，雖是不可避免的趨勢，但任意暴漲，便不合理。本局長對於平衡物價方策，不厭求詳，執行尤貴迅速，決心在標本兼治，加强戰力民生。日來一面改組物價評議委員會機構，一面通令各同業公會，限期將貨物成本造報，以爲審定物價標準在抑平物價範圍以內，仍當兼顧商民利潤，以示公平，但有少數尙未遵辦者，甚覺遣憾。前天本局長奉實業部電召晋京，陳部長對於物價對策，已有緊急措置辦法，該辦法已得盟邦及市府當局聯絡協助。本局長茲將該項辦法要點向各位聲明：（一）各主要商品同業公會，應將三十四年二月五日所屬商品當地批發及零售價格，向物價評議會據實呈報。（二）此後未經核准之物價，不得任意抬高，違則依法嚴處。（三）物價評議會得查明其呈報價格重予核定。（四）各主要商品同業公會，應將本年二月五日所屬商品存貨數量，迅向本局詳實呈報，以后並按月報吿一次。（五）嚴厲取締囤積。（六）依法實施主要商品登能。（七）取締不良經紀人。以上各點希望各位注意，切實遵照，本局長言出法隨，願與各同業公會，共體時艱，努力邁進。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The National Government Announced Emergency Measures on Commodity Prices Yesterday; Speeches by President Chen and Ambassador Gu <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to implement wartime economic policies, strengthen control of commodity prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government authorities have decided to take decisive measures and have formulated emergency measures on commodity prices. Price evaluation committees in various regions are charged with strengthening their organizations and strictly evaluating prices. Local competent authorities should implement registration for major commodities according to the law and strictly crack down on hoarding. Those who arbitrarily raise prices without approval will be severely punished according to the law. At the same time, major commodities not registered by members of various trade associations, and large quantities of materials purchased and stored by ordinary citizens exceeding the amount for personal use, will be strictly cracked down upon. These emergency measures are in fact aimed at addressing the causes of rising commodity prices in various regions and are a direct response to those hoarding and manipulating prices. It is expected that commodity prices will tend to stabilize in the future, and people's livelihoods will be secured. President of the Executive Yuan Chen issued an important statement yesterday, reiterating the government's determination to control commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, and expressing his deep hope that businesspeople and citizens nationwide would earnestly comply. Ambassador Gu, representing an Allied nation stationed in China, also issued a statement, expressing his full support for the National Government's measures. The full text of the measures and the original speeches of President Chen and Ambassador Gu are recorded below:</p>
<p>Emergency Measures on Commodity Prices</p>
<p>(1) In order to implement wartime economic policies, strengthen control of commodity prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government has specially formulated these measures.</p>
<p>(2) Major commodity trade associations should truthfully report the local wholesale and retail prices of their commodities as of February 5, 1945, to the competent price evaluation committee. Thereafter, prices may not be arbitrarily increased without approval, otherwise they will be severely punished according to the law. The price evaluation committee may investigate and verify the reported prices and re-approve them.</p>
<p>(3) Price evaluation committees in various regions should strengthen their organizations and strictly evaluate prices.</p>
<p>(4) Local competent authorities should implement registration for major commodities according to the law and strictly crack down on hoarding.</p>
<p>(5) Major commodity trade associations should promptly and accurately report the quantity of their commodities in stock as of the date specified in Article 2 to the local competent authorities, and thereafter report them once a month.</p>
<p>(6) Local competent authorities should strictly crack down on major commodities not registered by members of trade associations and large quantities of materials purchased and stored by ordinary citizens exceeding the amount for personal use. The amount for personal use shall be determined separately by the local competent authorities.</p>
<p>(7) Local competent authorities should strictly crack down on illegal trading activities by intermediaries.</p>
<p>(8) Financial inspection organizations should be strengthened, and financial operations should be thoroughly inspected.</p>
<p>(9) When implementing these measures, local competent authorities should strictly prevent the evasion of major commodities.</p>
<p>(10) These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Speech by President Chen</p>
<p>Enhancing combat power, the most important thing is to stabilize people's livelihoods. The fundamental policy is to increase production and establish security, while the immediate solution is to control commodity prices and regulate materials. In order to achieve practical results quickly, both fundamental and immediate solutions should be adopted, and both the underlying principles and practical applications should be implemented simultaneously. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the government has been continuously striving to increase production and establish security, and controlling commodity prices and regulating materials has been one of the key tasks. Over the past three years, the arrangements and facilities have all been based on this principle, always studying and balancing them, so that market transactions gradually become rational, people's livelihoods can be stabilized, and the country can be restored. However, recently commodity prices have remained high, affecting people's livelihoods greatly. The reason for this, although due to the imperfect supply and demand of materials, is mainly due to the greed of a few unscrupulous elements, which is the main reason for the soaring commodity prices. In order to implement wartime economic policies and stabilize people's livelihoods, emergency measures on commodity prices have been promulgated today, designating the price on February 5 as the standard market price, and implementing them first in Beijing and Shanghai. Thereafter, the prices of major commodities may not be increased without authorization, but if there is a real need for adjustment, the government will take into account the actual situation and re-approve them reasonably. Those who hoard and speculate, intending to manipulate prices, or who use financial means to fuel hoarding, will be severely punished. As for the source of materials, we will also try to dredge them to meet the current needs. I hope that businesspeople and citizens will earnestly comply, and the future of people's livelihoods will depend on it.</p>
<p>Speech by Ambassador Gu</p>
<p>The National Government of the Republic of China has previously formulated three major policies of establishing security, rectifying ideology, and increasing production, and is striving to realize them. The increase in production is not only necessary to enhance combat power in the Greater East Asia War, but also the most important prerequisite for stabilizing people's livelihoods. Since its implementation, it has overcome all difficulties and vigorously promoted various policies, which is deeply gratifying. The Japanese government also firmly believes that the stability of Chinese people's livelihoods is a prerequisite for China's restoration and an indispensable condition for the revitalization of Asia. We are willing to provide maximum cooperation and assistance to the National Government in these policies. Our determination is also stated in the wartime economic establishment countermeasures announced before the war, which further clarifies that since the government announced its new policy toward China, it has always maintained an unwavering determination to cooperate in the advancement of various Chinese policies.</p>
<p>However, although the National Government has the above-mentioned policies, there are still some people who fail to understand the government's intentions, and are dedicated to pursuing private interests and desires, rampant with corruption, hindering increased production, and threatening the lives of the majority of the people. Such dregs have not yet disappeared. In his inaugural address, Chairman Chen of the National Government expressed his determination to realize the clean government of the late Chairman, and strongly stated that those who poison the people and endanger the country, no matter who they are, will be regarded as national traitors, and the National Government is determined to jointly expel the harmful thieves with the people. Recently, Mayor Zhou of Shanghai also clarified that he would not show any leniency to corrupt officials and opportunistic merchants, and would severely punish them. Now, the National Government, in order to promote the combat power of China's economy and stabilize people's livelihoods, has decided on emergency measures on commodity prices as part of its economic policy, resolutely suppressing the improper rise in commodity prices and suppressing hoarding and speculation before the upcoming Lunar New Year. It is believed that the people of China will be extremely welcome.</p>
<p>The Japanese government not only expresses its heartfelt support for the above policies, but also decides to adapt to the requirements of the Chinese side, and all military and civilian personnel in China will provide cooperation and assistance to the Chinese side. During the promotion of this policy, there will be no discrimination or unfair treatment between the Chinese and Japanese people. Japanese residents who engage in improper business operations will also be strictly investigated and punished according to the law. It is hoped that the Japanese residents in China will understand the National Government's policies and cooperate with the Japanese government to promote this policy.</p>

General Rundstedt, commander-in-chief of the German army on the Western Front, expects very fierce fighting to occur soon. The German military authorities are aware that the enemy has concentrated a strong tank force on the entire Aachen line in the past few weeks, so the fifth battle for Aachen will be launched, sacrificing an unprecedented amount of material. All German troops know that the time for the decisive battle has arrived, and the enemy will encounter even more fierce resistance and suffer greater losses than before.</p>

<h3 id="e8">15 Enemy Aircraft Attacking Kanto Shot Down; Damage Inflicted on Other Enemy Aircraft <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 11th: When about 90 enemy aircraft attacked the Kanto area on the 10th, the Japanese air force shot down 15 of them. In addition, damage was inflicted on a considerable number of other enemy aircraft. In this battle, the Japanese side lost 7 aircraft that self-destructed and did not return.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 10th, about 90 enemy B-29s attacked the northern Kanto area of Japan. The Japanese air defense forces immediately and bravely intercepted them in the fierce and cold high altitude, surrounded the enemy aircraft, and shot down 15 of them, inflicting heavy damage on a considerable number of enemy aircraft. The actual number of enemy aircraft heavily damaged, if calculated by interception area, or the number of enemy aircraft shot down or heavily damaged by another Japanese aircraft after one Japanese aircraft damaged them, may inevitably have duplicates. Therefore, the exact number is difficult to determine. Therefore, the Japanese General Headquarters will not specify the number of enemy aircraft damaged in the future, but will generally announce it according to the following standards: If only less than 30% of the attacking aircraft are heavily damaged, it is considered to have damaged a small number of aircraft; 30% to 60% is considered a considerable number; and more than 60% is considered a large number. Therefore, in this attack, of the approximately 90 enemy aircraft that attacked, 15 were shot down, and approximately 30 to 50 were heavily damaged. Furthermore, if half of the heavily damaged aircraft cannot fly back to base, the total number of aircraft shot down means that the enemy lost 30 to 40 aircraft in this air raid, and the number of personnel killed reached 400 to 500. The Japanese side also sacrificed 7 valuable aircraft. However, even though the enemy suffered such heavy losses, their intention to repeatedly attack should not be underestimated.</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Three-Headed Conference and the European Situation <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The recent evolution of the European war situation has greatly impacted the complex relationship between the Allied countries of Britain and the United States. To cope with the special situation under the new war situation and review the various problems to be solved, the Allied leaders, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, held another conference in early February in an area of the Black Sea. This was their second joint meeting since the Tehran Conference at the end of November 1943.</p>
<p>Their talks have now been going on for several days, and the content is unknown. However, based on the current reality, the information revealed by all parties, and based on speculation of their subjective intentions, the center of the talks will roughly be: (1) how to deal with the current war situation, (2) how to deal with Germany, (3) how to divide spheres of influence, and (4) how to establish international relations after the end of the war.</p>
<p>This conference was based on their subjective ideas—that Europe is about to end. Due to the complexity of the relationships between them and the deep-seated fundamental contradictions, it is inevitable that they will blush and have many disputes in the talks, so it is unlikely to have good results.</p>
<p>Regarding the first issue of how to deal with the current war situation, there seem to be several contradictions here: First, the accelerated progress of the Soviet army has aroused the jealousy of Britain and the United States. This was the case when the Soviet army approached Warsaw last time, and it is even more so today when the Soviet army approaches Berlin. This jealousy may affect their organic coordinated operations on the east and west sides. Second, the three countries want to end the war as soon as possible, but on the other hand, once the war ends, the political contradictions between them will immediately unfold deeply, and may be more difficult to deal with than combat, so they hesitate again. As the Spanish newspaper ABC reporter said: "The Allies now fear peace as they feared war before, because the political problems that have been delayed for many times are now becoming urgent." Third, whether the war ends early or not cannot be determined by their ideals. Even if the Soviet army captures Berlin and the war shifts westward, Germany can still continue to fight with western Germany as the center, north from Norway and Denmark to Italy in the south, so it is too early to think that the European war can be ended after capturing Berlin.</p>
<p>Regarding the second issue of how to deal with Germany, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have repeatedly declared that Germany must surrender unconditionally. However, due to the strong military power of Germany and the firm will of the German people, it is really too difficult for Germany to surrender unconditionally. The more the war goes on, the more difficult it becomes, and the greater the sacrifices. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are now strong on the outside but weak on the inside. In order to maintain some vitality as much as possible, they are reluctant to make excessive consumption again, so they want to use political means in addition to military means to make Germany submit and disintegrate Germany from the political aspect. The joint declaration that the three countries will issue to the German people, announced by London and Cairo, declaring the so-called conditions and forms of "unconditional surrender", has a very subtle effect. It is said that the three countries have hinted that their purpose is to overthrow Hitler's National Socialist Germany, but not to destroy the German people. This is a trick used by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to induce the German people to surrender. However, the restrictions imposed on Germany by the Allied powers after the last war have been enough for the German people. This time, the German people will not be fooled again.</p>
<p>The third issue is how to divide spheres of influence, which is simply the most complex issue. This issue mainly targets the small countries in Europe and distributes spheres of influence. First, each small country must maintain its independence on the surface, and second, the distribution of power must be balanced, which is really not easy to handle. At present, the military power of the Soviet Union extends from Finland in the north, along the Baltic Sea through the three small countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and then through Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, Hungary, to most or all of Romania and Bulgaria in the Balkans, plus Germany, which is under attack, and Austria, which has recently become the target of attack, covering more than ten countries of all sizes, and political influence extends to Greece, Turkey, and even France. The military power of Britain and the United States now only extends to France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the border of Germany in Western Europe, and Italy and Greece in the Mediterranean. Britain and the United States are very afraid of the strong military and political power of the Soviet Union in Europe, so recently not only has there been fierce infighting, but also open strife has often been revealed. Some countries have two governments after the Germans withdrew, and the contention between the London government-in-exile, relying on Britain and the United States, and the local temporary government supported by the Soviet Union, reflects the struggle between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The situation in Poland is even more obvious. For example, the internal strife in Greece, with the left-wing ELAS resisting Britain, is actually a conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union. Obviously, the struggle for power and profit between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will become more and more intense as the war evolves. Moreover, there are many contradictions not only between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, but also between Britain and the United States, and even between Britain, the United States, and France.</p>
<p>The fourth issue is how to establish international relations after the end of the war, which is closely related to the third issue. Since the contradictions between the countries, especially Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, are so deep, it may be difficult to establish a new international organization that can truly coordinate after the war. At the same time, cooperation between countries in the economic field may not be completely successful. Furthermore, the so-called liberation of the coerced small countries is bound to be a deceptive trick of empty promises and no substance.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be predicted that this three-headed conference will not have much results. Even if there are any results, it is doubtful whether everyone will be able to fulfill them in the future. However, their new conspiracy cannot but be taken note of. The evolution of the European situation will affect the Far East at any time, and we must pay attention to its development.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Yesterday's Economic Bureau Convened Representatives of Various Industries for Talks: Emergency Measures Have Been Taken to Suppress and Stabilize Prices <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the general price level in this city has continued to rise, which has a serious impact on people's livelihoods. The economic authorities have repeatedly issued notices to merchants and the public, requiring them to strictly comply with the assessed and limited prices. However, some merchants, taking advantage of the Lunar New Year holiday, have arbitrarily raised prices without limit. The Municipal Economic Bureau has long been determined to suppress and stabilize prices. In order to take emergency measures, it convened representatives from various industry associations in the city at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 11:00 AM yesterday for a temporary emergency meeting. Representatives from over one hundred units attended, including those from the following industries: dried goods, tea snacks, local produce, general merchandise, Chinese and foreign department stores, hot water, ham, fresh meat, restaurants, staple grains and pastries, hardware, rickshaws, sliced noodles, [illegible character] production, cloth factories, raw silk, Western medicine, leather manufacturing, local tobacco, rubber, fruits, department stores, pickled vegetables and bean sprouts, woolens, woolen textiles, industrial oils and fats, tires, firewood. The Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, Mr. Xu Jiang, arrived on time to attend the meeting in person and gave a speech, explaining the severity of the high prices in the city and announcing the decision to take emergency measures, hoping that various industry associations in the city would assist the government in jointly suppressing and stabilizing prices. Finally, the Chief of the Third Section of the Bureau, Tang Shaochuan, explained the main points of the emergency measures. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Director Xu's Speech</p>
<p>From the beginning of my tenure as Director, I have considered suppressing and stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods to be the top priorities, and I strive to achieve them without empty talk. During this time of war, imbalances in the supply and demand of goods are unavoidable, and price fluctuations are therefore an inevitable trend. However, arbitrary and excessive price increases are unreasonable. I have sought detailed strategies to balance prices, and rapid implementation is especially important. I am determined to address both the root causes and the symptoms, and to strengthen both war effort and people's livelihoods. In recent days, I have been reorganizing the Price Assessment Committee and issuing notices to various industry associations, setting a deadline for submitting the cost of goods to serve as a standard for assessing prices. Within the scope of suppressing and stabilizing prices, we will still take into account the profits of merchants and the public to show fairness. However, it is regrettable that some have not yet complied. The day before yesterday, I was summoned to Beijing by the Minister of Industry and Commerce. Minister Chen has emergency measures in place to address prices, and these measures have been coordinated with the Allied nations and municipal government authorities. I will now state the main points of these measures to you: (1) The industry associations of all major commodities should truthfully report the local wholesale and retail prices of their commodities as of February 5, 1945, to the Price Assessment Committee. (2) Hereafter, prices that have not been approved must not be arbitrarily raised; violators will be severely punished according to law. (3) The Price Assessment Committee may investigate and re-approve the reported prices. (4) The industry associations of all major commodities should promptly and accurately report the quantity of their commodities in stock as of February 5 of this year to this Bureau, and thereafter submit monthly reports. (5) Severe crackdown on hoarding. (6) Implement registration of major commodities according to law. (7) Eliminate unscrupulous brokers. I hope you will pay attention to the above points and strictly comply with them. I will act according to my words and am willing to work with all industry associations to overcome difficulties and move forward together.</p>

<p>Previously, the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company in this city, in order to conserve electricity, stipulated that the time for electricity users to use lights would be uniformly from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM. It is now learned that the company, in view of the power supply and transmission lines for important facilities in certain areas, must continue to supply power even after 10:00 PM. It is hoped that those who intentionally use electricity without authorization outside of the restricted hours, violating the purpose of conserving electricity, will quickly comply and not exceed the limits to avoid penalties.</p>

<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has carefully adjusted the selection of branch chiefs and their powers in order to reform police administration. All section chiefs must be under the command of the branch chiefs and handle all affairs. Therefore, after the branch chiefs took office, they strictly rectified police affairs. Yao Benyuan, the chief of the Changning Road Branch, found that the surveillance posts in his jurisdiction had a very close relationship with the public. Therefore, after taking office, he earnestly instructed the police officers that they must not extort or harass merchants along the way. Yesterday, he personally inspected the surveillance posts at Zhongshan Bridge, Changan Road, West Railway Station, and Hongqiao Road. The situation was generally satisfactory, but the bad practice of black market tickets at the West Railway Station has not yet been stopped, and it is being thoroughly investigated.</p>

<p>Since the adjustment of rickshaw fares in this city on the 16th of last month, it has not yet been a month, and due to the high cost of living, a request has been submitted to the Municipal Government authorities for another fare increase starting yesterday (11th). The new fares are: 450 yuan for a double-seat rickshaw for a minimum of 30 minutes, with an additional 75 yuan for every 5 minutes thereafter, or 900 yuan per hour. The other single-seat rickshaws cost 300 yuan per half hour, with an additional 50 yuan for every 5 minutes, or 600 yuan per hour.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Special Ration Application Procedures <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Special Municipality Goods Rationing Office implemented special rations for civil servants of various agencies, the second phase of special rice rations has been implemented. Recently, the authorities of various agencies have been enthusiastically applying to the Bureau for special rations. However, some agencies have not yet understood the application procedures and have therefore been unable to receive them. According to the authorities of the Bureau, for special rations for agencies under the Municipal Government, it is necessary to first apply to the Secretariat of the Municipal Government for approval. For special rations for central agencies stationed in Shanghai, an official letter of certification from the central competent department or a direct designation of application for approval from the central competent departments is required before special rations can be approved.</p>

<p>According to the person in charge of the Municipal Consultation Committee, the Municipal Government purchased low-priced rice for distribution to various new middle class people. The committee was consulted about the purchase process beforehand. Because the payment was due within a limited time and required cash, they negotiated to pay half in cash and half in immediate remittance orders due to the short time. This was not approved. Therefore, the Fuxing Bank, which collected the rice payments, had to comply. During this short time, the bank's collection was extremely busy, especially because it was near the Lunar New Year. The service personnel were unexpectedly busy and are very thankful. However, the outside world felt that the cash was insufficient and expressed dissatisfaction with the bank. But in fact, the bank was only complying with orders. Therefore, the process is described in the hope that all parties will understand the truth.</p>
