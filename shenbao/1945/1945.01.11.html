<p>東京十日中央社電　日大本營八日下午三時三十分發表：（一）敵軍自一月六日晨侵入仁牙因灣內，對該灣沿岸實施砲擊，至九日上午九時四十分頃，即於聖法比安及仁牙因附近開始登陸。（二）當地日軍陸地部隊這擊激戰中，同時，日航空部隊亦對敵艦船加以猛攻。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地十日中央社電　美軍終於九日在仁牙因灣開始登陸，此日在聖法比安及達古朋正面游戈之敵艦猛烈砲護衛，達莫爾迭斯及聖托馬斯海面之敵軍船團，於上九時在聖法比安正面散開，直向海岸突進，此時敵衛護艦隊之上空，轟然張起制空砲火之彈幕，瞬問敵艦突然猛噴黑烟，迨黑烟消沉，軍艦已踪影不見，此定由日軍特攻隊勇敢之拼撞戰沉，九時四十分，敵軍登陸部隊，終於向聖法比安及仁牙因兩處前進，在日方砲擊下，其先導舟艇相繼粉碎，然敵軍登陸第一隊，在猛烈之砲擊掩護下，仍繼續突進，終於到達海岸，刹那問美兵自舟艇散開登陸，拼命奔馳，但於日軍陣地之砲火之下，美兵紛紛倒斃沙灘，然繼第一登陸部隊之後，第二隊亦開始登陸，的四千噸十大型舟艇十五六艘，已突入海岸，近午雙方砲聲隆隆，震撼海岸，呂宋島決戰序幕，終於仁牙因灣海岸揭開。</p>

<p>菲律賓基地十日中英社電　非律賓之決戰，已進入正式階段。敵軍欲於呂宋島登陸之意，已爲暴露。敵艦隊自六日以來，即以約百艘之登陸用舟艇及空母，戰艦。巡洋艦等多艘護衛下之運輸船團，侵入仁牙因灣，同時蘇魯海方面復有二百餘艘之敵大船團，急駛北上，對此敵之行動，嚴重監視待機邀擊中之日水上特攻隊及陸海軍航空部隊，相率出動，猛烈奇襲，目下呂宋島西方海面，彼此之艦艇及航空部隊混成一團，而展開大激戰中。日軍水上特攻隊，八日黎明又正面衝入馬尼刺灣西方海上北進中之敵艦船羣，乘敵船團大混亂之機，痛烈猛擊。迄今判明，擊沉敵大小運輸船三十餘艘。而日軍機隊發見敵軍出現於蘇魯海方面，瞬間，即加以猛攻，敵艦船羣遭此痛擊，完全混亂，日軍特攻隊予敵損失，以此次爲最大。迄九日於仁牙因灣內僅有敵大小運輸船約七十艘及由蘇魯海北上之新船團，以馬尼刺爲中心之呂宋島西南一帶，尙無敵軍登轟炸，然馬尼刺及呂宋　其他各地仍極平靜，因菲律賓有堅强陣地，日軍戰概。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地一日中央社電　自六日以來，企圖於呂宋島强行登陸而侵入仁牙因灣之敵艦船團，自遭日陸海軍特攻隊之猛攻後，已蒙極大損失，唯現仍竊窺登陸之機會，於該灣海面附近遊弋，並繼續向聖凡南多以砲艦射擊中。又後續之敵運輸船團，亦於蘇魯海向里島西海面轉進，而出現於呂宋島西方海面，八日黎明經日陸海軍水上特攻隊猛擊，亦已絕跡。現在所判明之戰果，計轟擊沉敵大小運輸船三十艘以上，此外更因日軍水上艦艇不斷之猛攻，予以痛烈打擊，灣內。現日陸海軍特攻飛行隊及水上艦艇，依然對此繼續猛攻，於呂宋島西方海面，刻正展開激烈之海空戰中。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地十日中央社電企岡於呂宋西岸登陸之敵軍，其機動部隊因恐日軍特別攻擊隊之必死政擊及因遭屢次猛襲喪失之空母，故於仁牙因灣海而，僅使用特設空母，施以艦砲射擊，其後改變陳形，向海面逃逸，其行動亦極爲緩慢。八日黎明，日空軍以陸軍特攻隊爲先導，猛烈攻擎於仁牙因灣外逃脫之六十餘艘敵艦船，一機命中敵艦船，一機命中敵戰艦，立即沉沒。</p>

<p>東京十日中央社電　日大本營十日下午二時發表：九日下午敵機侵襲日本本土時，日軍邀　戰果如次：擊落敵機十一架，內撞落者四架，予敵機以損傷者十八架，日方損失五架。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之敵B29型機的六十架，分散來製關東，東海道及近畿地方，關於其邀擊戰果，事後調査，計繫落十一架，損毁十八架，共二十九架，的爲來襲敵機之半數。緣是日敵機來襲時，日制空部隊當即出動，加以邀擊，展開果敢之邀繫戰，到處追捕敵機，，加以熾烈政擊，使敵機無所施展，編隊散亂，盲無目標，所投炸彈，悉落於海面或山由，而倉皇遁走。日方邀擊戰鬥，極爲激烈，故重要設施之工塲毫無損害，擊落之敵機中之四架，均係由於日震大制空部隊壯烈拚撞而擎墜者，參與拚撞之一架，於繫落敵機後，同還基地，另一架以降落傘降落海上，生死不明，又二架則經拚撞後壯烈戰死。若更詳細觀此次之戰果，侵入關東地方敵機約二十架，其半數全被擊落，殘餘各機亦悉蒙受損害，故侵人敵機之大部，均難歸返馬里亞納基地也。又是役日方損失（拚撞各機在內）共犧牲五架。</p>
<p>空襲台灣敵機墜毀二十三架</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　據台北電，台灣地區發表，敵　機的四百五十架及由中國大陸飛來之少數大型機，於九日上午六時四十分至下午四時半，來襲台灣各地，我方損害輕微，截止現在判明之戰果，計擊落十五架（其四架不確），擊毀八架。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電九日下午一時半，曾有自馬里亞納羣島飛來之敵B29型機約六十架，來襲新　本土，計東京及周團地區約二十架，寮獗北海道地區約四十架，各以分散形式侵入，當遭日特攻隊及制空部隊勇敢邀擊，僅投下盲無目標之炸彈，甚到有投彈於海中者，醜態百出，歷一小時半，即向南方海上遁去，雖有在工廠附近投下炸彈者，但亦不無命中者，日方地上殆無損失，敵機之作分散轟炸，意在分散日方邀擊戰力，然卒爲日方制空部隊擊退。</p>

<p>出一分力　享一分福</p>
<p>我們參觀已經兩年，這兩年來我們對參戰盡了什麼的責任，我們反躬自問未參戰前和參戰以後，有什麼不同，我們要增加生產到達什麼的程序，我們要節約消息費，我們的衣食住行有沒有配合戰時體制，出一分力，才能享受一分的幸福，我們要自由要解放，要正義要和平，我們要付出相當的代價，我們的代價便是實踐新國民運動。</p>
<p>要求解放　須付代價</p>
<p>我們參戰已經兩年，這兩年來我們對參戰盡了什麼的責任？我們反躬自問，未參戰前和參戰以後有什麼不同？我們要增加生產，增加生產到達什麼的程度？我們要節約消費，我們的衣食住行有沒有配合戰時體制？出一分勞力，才能享受一分的幸福，我們要自由要解放，出相富的代價，我們的代價便　是實踐新國民運動。</p>
<p>自從民國三十一年元且領袖手訂新國民運動綱要以來，也已經整整三年了，這三年來我們遵照領袖的訓示，展開新國民運動的工作，雖一點一滴的工作積聚起來，粗具基礎，但離開領袖的期望，依舊很遠很遠，而世界的戰局大東亞的戰局也一天比一天嚴重。同胞們，和平運動是國民革命再出發的階段，大東亞戰爭又到了決戰的時期，前進抑或後退，勝利抑或失敗，就看全國同胞有沒有朝着新國民運動一條路走。</p>
<p>興復中華肩起責任</p>
<p>我們要興復中華，我們要保衛東亞，首先要全國大多數國民起來負担這種責任，而要負担責任，首先要培養負祖的能力，貢獻少，享受多。替個人打算，不肯替國家民族出力，沒有團結觀念，像一盤散沙，這些都是人家給我們國民的壞批評，我們也不諱言，這是我們做國民的劣根性。我們要做新國民，我們不再做舊國民，我們是要把舊國民一切思想行動來一個總清算。新國民運動就是要把民族主義，代替過去的個人主義，民主集權制度代替虛偽的歐美民主主義，民生主義代替共產主義。在一個主義，一個中心思想揭藥之下，愛中國，愛東亞，中國四萬萬五千萬的國民者具備這個信念，都實踐這個信念，都成爲新的國民，中國前途才有希望，東亞前途才有希望。</p>
<p>推進新運加倍努力</p>
<p>事變前有人提倡新生活運動，新生活運動是要養成許多良好的個人，全中國的人都變成好人，然而只是從個人的立塲打算，使之成爲好人，是不够的，並且是不可能的。我們必須有堅强的國家民族觀念，我們必須有正確的東亞自由意識，我們所要造就的，是優秀的中華民國國民，是優秀的東亞民族。在國際帝國主義者宰制下的東亞裏，在國際帝國主義者侵害中的中國襄，要想潔身自愛，要想民哲保身，那不但是妄想而且是荒謬。中國得不到自由平等，什麼生活革新都是廢話，東亞得不到解放，則中國之自由平等，也無法獲得，就算燒倖得到了，也是不能確保的。參戰的根本意義即在於此，和平運動的根本精神也在於此。自從新國民運動倡導以來，我們秉承領袖意旨推進新運，新運在這三年來工作的成續，進步很慢，雖然環境種種困難，使新運工作推進發生阻力，但我們牢記着領袖的訓示，我們要說老實話，要負責任，我們絕對不願意推卸責任，正因爲過去新運工作有許多使人不能滿意的地方，我們以後要更加努力。</p>
<p>認清友敵抉擇途徑</p>
<p>記得去年十月本人代表中國青少年赴日本，省領袖病狀，領袖於病榻前召見，殷殷以拓展新運組訓青年，期諸一般同志，這番話竟成了領袖對我們靑年同志最後一次的遺言，一言一語永永深吊於我們的心坎裏。我們惟有以最大的決心，無論如何困難，誓本領袖遺訓，努力推進。我們所能吿慰領袖在天之靈的，只有實現領袖遺訓，把中國救回來，把東亞救回來。而要救中國救東亞，不能靠少數的同志，要靠大多數國民，要靠大多數國民都成爲國家的新國民、東亞的新志士。</p>
<p>我們要正告在重慶的同胞，在中國內地的同胞，你們也都是中華民國的同胞，你們也都愛我們所愛的中華民國。自從大東亞戰爭爆發以後，雖然有些人以爲只要英美反攻，便可以擊敗日本，只要派飛機到和平區轟炸，便可以擾亂人心，然這也許是不得已的。然而三年來的戰爭事實，英美對重慶的猙獰面孔，共黨對重慶的跋扈飛揚，誰是朋友，誰是敵人，各人飲水，冷暖自知。同胞們，全國同胞們，內憂如此，外患又如此，謀略如此，事實又如此，究意何去何從，要立定脚跟，放開眼界，決定我們應走的途徑。同胞們，中國是我們的中國，東亞是我們東亞，只有遵奉領袖實錢新國民運動的遺訓，方可以復興我們的中國，保衛我們的東亞，立定堅强的決心，整齊一致的步驟，拓展新運，完遂一戰爭。</p>

<h3 id="c8">菲島戰爭的新形勢 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>這幾天菲律賓戰爭，有着極猛烈的展開，敵美現以雷伊泰島明多羅島爲中心，南自民答那峨經尼古洛斯島（即黑人島）巴納島海面，以至北面的呂宋島，分頭侵擾，規模很大，有不惜重大犧牲，孤注一擲的態勢。</p>
<p>就作戰地區和性質上看，目下菲律賓戰事　可分做五個部份：</p>
<p>第一是雷伊泰島明多羅島的陸上戰，</p>
<p>第二是民答那峨島海面的輸送戰，</p>
<p>第三是巴納島尼古洛斯島的連絡戰，</p>
<p>第四是呂宋島的登陸戰，</p>
<p>第五則是菲律賓區域以外臺灣海及蘇門答　海面的牽制戰。</p>
<p>花上述五個戰爭部份中，第四部　的呂宋島登陸戰，是敵美作戰的重心，敵美最主要的目標，也就是企岡在呂宋島登陸，並妄想即在呂宋島和日軍決勝。盟邦小磯首相於一月四日閣議席上也曾指出：「雷伊泰決戰已轉移爲呂宋決戰」</p>
<p>雷伊泰島和明多羅島敵美　現積極從事於鞏固其登陸的基地，以作戰略的中心，但兩島日軍陸上部隊的抗禦非常堅强，不斷對已登陸的敵軍作猛烈的奇襲，同時日機又通續對敵人在島上的飛機塲，施以破壞性的攻擊。敵美在兩島的登陸基地旣無法鞏固，因此所謂戰略的中心作用和任務，也就不易達到。</p>
<p>民答那峨島方面，因該島在菲律賓的最南部，敵美來自新幾內亞及澳洲而北上的援軍和給養，大都要經過民答那峨海面及民答那峨之西的蘇　海，所以日軍在那面對敵美作輸遂戰，以截斷敵軍的援給，非常有力，敵方的運輸船團，日來正不斷遭受英勇的日軍邀學。</p>
<p>巴納島和尼古洛斯島是居於菲律賓島的中部，在蘇魯海的東北，民答那峨的西北，介雷伊泰島和明多羅島之間，略爲南面些。敵美爲圖連結雷伊泰島和明多羅島，所以對巴納島和尼古洛斯島的野心也很大，近幾天這兩島海面的戰事也相當緊張，敵艦船在日軍邀擊之下，損失極重。</p>
<p>呂宋海面的戰爭，現大致集中於呂宋島西部仁牙因灣，敵目下正發動其大部力量，在仁牙因，聖法比安（仁牙因灣東北端）附近登陸，從而立足呂宋島。不過由　日軍抗禦力量的堅强，敵軍登陸的理想，決非易事。雖已登陸，但犧牲過大，精疲力盡，再後亦必將無能爲力。至於敵機在台灣冲繩的空襲，含有示威及擾亂日本後方的意圖。又敵英印度洋艦隊出現於蘇門答臘西海面，亦有呼應和牽制作用。但不管敵方如何作戰，到處都是遭遇日軍的迎頭痛擊。現時敵一方面雖見聲色俱厲，但另一方面實則後力空虛，長途遠征，愈深入，就愈有被殲的機會。盟邦强大的海空軍力量，今後必將有更高的發揮。</p>

<p>南京十日中央社電　行政院治理運河工程局，於去歲間爲改變工程實施計劃之四點設計，曾縷舉理由，呈請行政院備案核准，院方以此舉不僅爲工程本身問題，且於經費出入甚有關係，特轉令建設部審核具覆。惟建設部以該四點改變設計於工程之舊存狀態及計劃，完成之詳圖，均付缺如，致於審核工作無從着手，遂據情呈復政院，行政院於獲悉詳情，復於去歲十二月間明令治運工程局補具詳圖。以備審核。頃悉治運局已將該項明令轉送工地，俾即着手測量，補製詳圖，記者爲明瞭治運工程現在狀况起見，特走訪治運局負責者，據云：治運工程簽定合同後，自開工日起，原定十二月底完工，惟以材料運輸困難，及地方治安關係，故工人逐漸减少，致使工程進行蒙受阻碍，治運局雖預慮爲使工程能達到圓滿地步，決定改變四點設計，俾得如期完成，工程進行迄今，估計的可完成百分之六十，承包建築商奧南公司已要求治運局展期至二月十五日以前完工，現因雨雪關係，路途阻塞，故於工地詳情，届期能否完成，尙不能預卜，今日規定包工，有不能如期完工，應處罰款，以賠償損失，現治運工程，已一再藉口展期，關於此項問題，將於工程完成時妥爲解決。</p>

<p>南京十日中央社電　中國國府陳代理主席，於參戰二週年紀念日之九日午後五時，特發表昭示世界之談話，促英美帝國主義者及渝政權之猛者，其大意如次：</p>
<p>此次大戰自爆發以來，迄今已歷數載，世界人類，所以遭此難忍之痛苦，與空前之慘禍者，莫不皆由貪婪無厭之英美帝國主義之野心。英國平常標榜自由平等，實乃係狹量之殖民地榨取手段，彼等之所謂殖民地政策，乃爲金融獨佔支配及侵略異民族之具體表現，惟此種舊秩序，已由於此次大戰正瀕於崩潰之途，望英國民速一掃盎格羅薩克遜之優越感，及蔑視異族之觀念，並放棄其經濟獨佔政策，而認識國際間互惠平等之崇高原則，則最後之勝利，當歸於要求自存自衛與共榮之國家，美國亦然。蓋美國戰爭之指導者，均爲猶太資本家所煽動，驅使美國民陷於戰爭途上，美本土並未遭受絲毫成脅，而却燃起制覇世界之野心，企圖根絕要求自由解放之幾千萬被壓迫民族生存，其狂妄實令人痛憤。</p>
<p>患難同處目標同一</p>
<p>關於重慶同志，過去二十年來本係共同繼承國父之遺志，爲完成革命大業，同處患難，向同一目標而努力。時至今日，不過僅係過程上意見相異而已。幸而中國於我在主席領導之下，爲完成自由平等，繼續努力，達至今日，恢復主權之基礎已經奠定，所以爲了維護主權，必賴國內早日統一，現在不平等條約業已撤廢，租界亦已經收回，由此事實，已可逐漸證明盟邦日本援助中國之熱忱。中國及大東亞各國，目下正爲民族之自存，及人類之共榮，與日滿兩國繼續奮鬥，吾人的前途發出光明的燦爛，英美兩國侵略野心終必失敗，在此動亂之中，唯有基於國際正義與互惠平等之原則，方能獲得共榮之將來，在此新秩序之下，各國方能各得其永久和平。</p>
<h3 id="c12">出淵部長　揭露敵美野心　利用渝方對日作戰 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>盟邦日本在滬陸軍報道部出淵部長，昨（十）日下午三時，假外灘華懋飯店八樓，舉行報道常會即席發表重慶遭受敵美利用所造成困難之悲劇，其談話如次；</p>
<p>重慶軍力損失慘重</p>
<p>去年日軍在大陸進攻作戰以後，渝方遭受損失極大，所有其出產農產品及鑛產品之土地，完全損夫，其兵力全部或一部損失者計有六十餘師，受相當損失者，亦有二十三八十餘萬，兵器損失約敷三十至四十個師團之用，子彈損失約敷四十至五十個師團之用。</p>
<p>敵美助渝別具用心</p>
<p>渝方經此重大打擊後，其依賴美國益形强化，並改編軍隊，强化徵兵，及動員學生，軍政雙方並聯合起來，企圖挽回頹勢，恢復自主抗戰。但美國援蔣目的，本擬利用渝方人力物力，對日作戰，去年底美國最高指揮部，曾派聯絡官至渝方各部隊內部，企圖將渝方軍隊置於美國指揮之下，並企圖在中國東南方面登陸，而渝方則期望借美國之援助，自動作戰，與美國之野心，正相背而馳。此種雙方矛盾情形，不啻對渝方一大悲劇，其可憐情態，可想而知。</p>
<p>日軍作戰節節勝利</p>
<p>日軍自在置西貴州越南北部勇敢作戰以來，節節勝利，已造成進攻重慶之態勢，預料今年一年中，定可得到相當戰果。以後美國計劃在中國大陸作決戰塲所，並利用渝方人力物力作戰，但渝方之兵力，決不堪日軍之一擊，其終爲日軍所殲滅無疑</p>

<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>記者在蘇，適逢舉行「江蘇省第三屆戰時敎育會議」。承敎育廳袁殊廳長之邀，忝陪末席，暢聆蘇省及盟邦與會各長官之高見卓論，殊感欣幸。兼以自身過去亦曾服務敎育界有年，對此番會議，極感興趣。該會於去年（十二月二十六日）結束，爰將會中所見，並附具管見，草成本文，提供關心敎育人士之參攷。</p>
<p>回首當年</p>
<p>按「敎育」負有百年樹人之使命，對國家興衰，民族運命，影響至鉅。民廿六年前，蘇省敎育發達，不愧有「文化省」之美譽；戰事以後，變遷殊甚，雖經熱心敎育人士之努力，及該省敎育當局之苦心倡導，略復舊觀。但以質論，猶見遜色。</p>
<p>私校充斥</p>
<p>一省學校數目之增加，應爲敎育發達之象徵，但細加分析，則又有不然者。目前蘇省境內，私立學校畸形發達，此等學校，設備旣簡陋不合標準，而其目的泰半文爲「商業化」，祇知如何以廣招徠，以飽私囊，不知有他，遑論對敎育所貢獻。此種「學店」，比比皆是，其中固有規模略具，少有成績者，然究屬少數。</p>
<p>根據最近蘇省敎育廳統計之「蘇省初等敎育概况表」所載，目下全省總計有小學二二二五所，其中省立者五所，縣立者一七六七所，私立者四五三所。以縣立最多，私立决之，省立最少。中等敎育則適相反，現全省之省立中學有十一所，師範學校二，職業學校四，日語學校一，縣立者中學十九所，中學私立者，全省總計五十八所之多。衆寡之懸殊，一目了然。私校之如雨後春筍，其主因已如前言；至省立與縣立者，其量始終停滯，邇來更少增加，其故不外省庫奇絀，而歷來之執政者，又類多視「敎育」爲其行政範圍中較不重要之一環，無怪「敎育」設施之進步，較之其他膛乎其後也。</p>
<p>經費概況</p>
<p>蘇省敎育經費，客歲僅佔全省經費總額百分之六·二七弱。五年來其數字之增加，雖不謂不速，但較生活指數之直錢飛漲，兩者無法相比。按念九年度蘇省敎育經費，省欵與縣款之總數爲三·七〇〇·四八九元，三十年度較前者增加爲二·四四二·三八一元，三十一年度爲三·八九〇·。八九元，三十二年度爲四八·〇四八·四五八元，三十三年度則爲二五五，六二二·三四一元。考三十三年度之經費總額爲三〇三·六七〇·七九九元。綜觀上述歷年來增加之數，三十三年度之數額，已較二十九年之數，增加幾近百倍，但與物價之飛漲較，相去何止千里。</p>
<p>敎育經費，與生活指數之升漲，旣如龜兎競走，故影響敎職員之生活至大。目前省立小學最高待過爲三三五〇元（底薪一百九十元計算），十最低者爲一四五〇元（底薪一百二十元計算）中學敎員省立者最高爲五一八〇元（以擔任二十六小時課程計算），最低者二三〇〇元（以擔任十二小時計算），私立學校各自爲政，姑且不談。吾人若按諸蘇敎廳三十三年十一月中旬所編之「敎育人員，每費用一元之進款，及虧損統計表」，照此最現實，最科學的統計表看來，可知中學敎員亨最高待遇者，每爲生活支用一元，其進款僅有三角六分，虧損六角四分。至受最待遇之敎員，每常爲生活支用一元時，其進款僅有一角九分，虧損達八角一分。小學敎員則最高待過者，進款按之上列情形，僅爲二角三分，虧損爲七角七分；待過最低者，進款爲一角九分，虧損爲八角一分。再根據敎廳最近之預算，中學敎員之享最高得遇者，三十三年八月至十月按月可得五·八六〇元，十一月一日起按月可得六·五六〇元，然考諸十月間最低限度之現實生活，其支出的爲一二·〇〇〇元，十〇月後受物價之猛漲影響，已增至一八·〇〇〇元，收支相差之巨，有如是者。於此一般敎職員生活困頓情形，可以想像而知。</p>
<p>師資缺乏</p>
<p>過去敎職人員以生活之威脅，紛紛改就他業。所餘者殊多濫芋充數，不學無術之輩，其影響兒童及靑年之學業殊巨。據云前此官廳甄別師資，實行檢定，結果十九非證件不全，即經歷不足。設嚴格以繩，則殊乏合格者，不得已而求其决，致形成目今之蕪雜陣容。然此輩又多對敎育缺少興趣，僅特聊勝於無之態度，敷衍塞責，且有一身兼數校課程，以資增加收入者，每因分身乏術，故有實施輪流缺課計劃者。據悉蘇州某一中學，九月至十一月止，統計缺課三百六十餘節，散漫情形，於此可見。</p>
<p>敎師旣十九因循苟安，對學生學業，漠不關心，終日遑遑祗求生活之解決，更無暇求已身智識之增進，則學生之成績，自必遜色。據悉前此蘇省敎育當局，舉行中學學生作文競賽，事後閱卷，其中未經敎員改正。從此可窺之一斑。</p>
<p>敎員生活</p>
<p>江蘇敎育界已臨於懸崖絕壁。當此一髪千鈞之秋，幸當局有「敎師生活補助委員會」及「敎師生活保險委員會」之設。對垂危之江蘇敎育界，不啻投一續命劑。吾人深望主管當局，以更大決心，施以治本之辦法，以期永久。茲就管見所及，貢獻數點：</p>
<p>（一）敎員生活之苦狀，實非一船人所能想象。欲求改進敎育，必先從安定敎員生活做起。治本辦法，莫若對敎職員之薪給，實施實物配給制，如能統盤籌劃，並得有關機關之協力，此舉不難實現。</p>
<p>（二）此外，同時於敎育之經費，亦家實行「開源」辦法。江蘇敎育界固有之學田十一萬畝，應以快刀亂麻之手段實施調査，勿再令此項學田，爲當地之土劣繼續把持，如是則二十二萬萬元之學田利費，對於久困水火之江蘇敎育界人土，不啻活命之瓊漿玉液也。</p>
<p>（三）依據戰時敎育方案之編製，實行生產敎育，目下雖有一二學校（如江蘇敎育學院學生之食物菜蔬皆係自足自給，省立蘇州職業學校實行造紙），已早實施，且有成效。亟宜普遍提倡，或强迫實行，庶幾對戰時生產有所貢獻，如是一面敎育，一面生產，亦能减轉學生家長之擔負。</p>
<p>（四）師資方面，亦應從速淘汰其資格過差及不忠聯務者，如待遇提高生活安定後，應盡量收吸優秀份子，同時創設「敎師互讀會」，俾於執敎之餘，作學問上之切碳與研究，此對敎育前途，實至關重要。</p>
<p>（五）欲求事半功倍，必須打破主管機關與地方負責者，及學校間之隔膜。務使下情上達，同心協力，使能挽此垂危狂瀾。否則縱有賢明之主管長官如袁廳長者，亦愛草曰能助也</p>
<p>以上管見所及，擇其重要者，貢諸蘇省當局，用作參考。（寄自蘇州）</p>

<h3 id="c35">取締高利貸 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 藹彭</p>
<p>目下上海物價的一再騰踊，漫無止境，固然由於物資缺乏，生產停頓，運輸困難，通貸膨脹，以及團戶的從中把持所致；但是此外更須知這上海經濟還另有一個黑暗面，這就是近來非常猖獗的高利貸。有了高利貸，邃使貨物成本加重，結果羊毛出在羊身上，仍舊轉嫁到　費者上面。欲求物價之不上漲，又安可得。所以居今日而言抑平物價，其道固多端，而取種高利貸，要已爲急不容綏之舉！</p>
<p>在一年以前，上海銀錢藥每月公定的欠息，尙不過三分內外，那時論者己　他們取息之高。豈知自從去年以來，久拆逐月提高，至年底巳達月息八分（即等於每千元每月利息八十元）。其實這般高昂的欠息，如果借款者與行莊執事沒有深厚交情，還是偕不到手。客氣些，於公定欠拆之外，加上二三分，作爲手續費；也有以一角二三分結算的。所謂利奉的黑市，也已成爲公開的秘密。此外更有一般人暗中經營貼票生意，期限短的只有五天，七天，息須先扣，利率每千元每三十天一百七十元至二百餘元不等。其所取利息之爲，遠勝於昔日印度人所放的印子錢，致令一般貨主以及營運的人們，—尤其是所謂單帮——背上如此重利，無形中即將成本增高。商人將本就利，豈肯虧本脫售，自然物價步步上漲了！大家都責難運貨來滬沿途關卡重疊，勒索備至，以致成本加重，又安知貨主對於借款利息的負擔，也與沿途的苛索重征，感覺同一的痛苦呢！</p>
<p>爲了貼票的生意好，利息厚，於是最近半年之中，三百六十行之外，又添了一行貼票生意，這些朋友，只要糾集幾十萬元本帳簿，就可以每月坐收十餘萬以至數十萬元的利息。三天一扣，五天一轉，極盡盤剝的能事，此等不勞而獲危害社會經濟的勾當，在戰時經濟體制下，實在是要不得的。</p>
<p>本來高利貸與高物價，都是同一經濟環境下的產物。所以要抑平物價，同時必須取締高利貸。最是值得我人慶幸的，就是今番主持滬政的新市長，也就是總綰全國金融的最高當局。因此由新市長來剷除上海經濟這一黑暗面，當必事半功倍。我們希望：（一）目下上海行莊的公公開利率之外，再加上任何手續費等等名目，蹈一般黑市僧的惡習。也許金融界中人以開支激增，無法彌縫，爲提高欠息的口實。要知道這些話只能騙騙外行人，實際上去年上海銀錢業，几是存款較多的行莊，無一不盈餘可觀！（二）取締貼現名詞的濫用。目下有許多行莊的所謂貼現，簡直是牛頭不對馬嘴，未免使年來一般積極提倡承兌匯票和票據貼現的朋友爲之垂頭喪氣。他們的所謂貼現，就是數十年前闖過大禍，同業懸爲厲禁的貼票。他們只管會圖重利，飲鴆止渴，一旦遭遇意外，必致眾動整個經濟機稱。希望新市長能約束銀錢業，從事自肅，今後不再從事名不副實的貼現業務。凡不發生商業交易忽關係之票據，—特別是空頭支票—絕對無攷慮貼現的餘地。（三）嚴禁私人間的非法高利貸。按重利盤剝，向干例禁。民法上對於利率，原有最高限度，過此即漸違法，不生効力。况在戰時，允不應以重利加重債務人負擔，危害社會經濟。而私人經營貼放，尤爲戰時金融管理條例所不許，自必在嚴禁之列。</p>
<p>我們相信高利貸苟能消減，—至少不使它再行猖獗—必能於抑平物價，安定民生的工作上，有相當的貢獻。如坐視高利貸的猖獗，不予取締，必使高物價與高利貸，互爲因果，互相雄長，決非上海人之福！</p>

<h3 id="c43">米糧配給的合理化 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>因戰事需要而物資缺乏，以致實行配給制，是任何參戰國家必有的現象，故際此時期的國民，一方面固然要努力生產，而在生活上，反要節衣縮食，加倍的刻苦耐勞，以期博取最後勝利。然而，這種情形是有一定限度的，在原則上：配給品無論如何少，終要足够其最低生活之需要。而最重要的，就是公平。窮富一體，全國一律，無特殊階級的存在。　云「不串寡而患平均。」不均，實在最容易引起國民的怨心，而孕畜着莫大的危機！</p>
<p>但遺憾的是中國的情形，恰是如此，雖然也實行配給制，但並不是全面的，配給物品數量，既不足够；而配給期又不準確；人民最低生活之需要，反仰求於統制外的黑市。至於支配，在配給者同是普遍的公平的配給，但因中國社會情形特殊。而在受配者，反感不均，因爲富有者燈紅酒綠，養尊處優，根本不需配給，即使配給，亦棄如敝履。但在貧苦者，則需要萬分，翹首跂足盼望，唯恐不足。有這樣情形，而採取普遍配給，自然不合理了。</p>
<p>目前各項配人品，都有上述弊　，而尤以米糧一項，特爲顯著。因爲米糧是民食之主，配給的足够與否，直接能影響於物價及民生。過去，雖然數易米糧配給機構，但對於米糧配給制度，大都着規曹隨，不加改革。舊制度的弊病，最顯著的是一，數量不足。二，配給期不準。三，配給米米質不劃一。四，支配不合理。一二兩項，直接威脅民生而引起物價暴漲，黑市猖獗，且影響市民對於米糧配給機構之信任。第三項米質不劃一，給與米商一舞弊機會，而使市民無形受屈。至於末項，支配之合理與否，尤其重要，關於此點，十二月五日申報社評欄「重點主義的米糧配給」一文內，有更詳細的討論：「現行米糧配給制度，最易使人感到未盡合理的缺憾，除數量不够需要，期間不能準確以外，就是支配的不合理。惟其因爲數量不足期間不準，支配就格外需要合理，以資彌補。……支配方面不能採取絕對普遍的方式，其間應有合理的區別，採取重點主義。……」</p>
<p>怎樣才是最合理的支配呢？換句話說：就是何謂重點主義？原則上：就是對真正需要者。及應該維持其需要者，增加其配給量。而使足够其生活需要。其他，則一律停止配給。我們希望主管當局，能澈底調整配給制，而實行重點主義，以彌補過去配量不足配期不準之缺憾。務使今後之民食，得上正軌，而消滅黑市，以蘇民困。</p>
<p>至於重點主義的米糧配給實施方案，應依照何種標準支配，才能合理，實難準確規劃。關於此點，筆者的意思如下：</p>
<p>至於此方法是否最標準，最合理，尚祈賢明之士，不吝指教，共同研究，而加以改善焉。</p>
<h3 id="c44">合理化的米糧配給法 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>（一）米糧配給對象，可分甲乙丙丁四種階級。配給數量及期限按此而定。</p>
<p>甲·凡係從事於戰事生產事業，而服務人數在二人以上之戶口者，列入甲種。</p>
<p>乙·凡係從事於民需生產事業，及特別爲國家社會服務之人員，或僅一人服務於軍需工廠者，列入乙種。</p>
<p>丙·與社會有聯繫之薪水階級，及勞工階級應列入丙種。</p>
<p>丁·無法謀生的婦老孤兒難民，列入丁種。</p>
<p>其他富有階級，及無業游民一概停止配給。</p>
<p>（二）配給數量依甲種爲最多，依次遞減。但是其量以不得少於丙種階級生活之最低需要爲原則。至於丁種，不妨少配，由慈善機關分向社會富有者捐募，而直接向產米區購運來以貼補。</p>
<p>（三）配給期與數量成正比，甲種最長，依此縮短。例如：甲種一月配一次，乙丙二十日配一次，丁種十日或十五日一次。</p>
<p>（四）配給量及其限，一經公佈，輕易不可更改，以維持信用。至於價格，亦不宜時常調整，以刺激別種物價，主管當局，不妨定一標準價，規定在某一時期內決不增加。譬如：以八千元一担爲列，在民三十四年一月至三月間，決不增價；至四月後，可按成本酌量漸漲。而至六月後再調整，人民體諒主管機關苦衷，自然接受，切勿任意增價。</p>
<p>（五）配給方法，現係按戶配給，實行重點主　後，可按團體配給：甲種以軍需工廠爲單位。乙種以民需工廠，學校，政府爲單位。丙種以商業公會爲單位。丁種以慈善機關爲單位。</p>
<p>主管機關，可規定一時間，各單位團體如需欲配給米者，可在期內申請。呈報人數及米糧總額，逾期概不通融，以後米票可分發各單位再轉發。使配者與受配者，有充分聯絡，如有增改移動，亦由各單位團體呈報，以便與保甲之戶口相檢核。</p>
<p>（六）所配米質，以後應明白規定，切忌用模稜兩可之字，而最好配給一種米，使米商無從取巧。</p>
<p>（附：第一項之分類，所以要二人以上服務在軍需工廠者才能列上甲種，無非一種獎勵而已。事實上配給對象以乙丙兩種最普遍）</p>
<p>上述六法，全是　　大者，其他問題，則有待於主管機關之檢討。如果能逐一實現，則非但可以一·安定民生，二·增加生產，並可三·矯正社會奢侈風氣，四·消滅黑市，五·防止囤積。六·無業游民，因受米糧限制，無形中逼其返鄉離滬，而達到疏散人口目的。一舉數得，端在主管　關之能誠心改革而已。</p>

<p>新星化學製藥廠函云：「敬啓者：近來物價無限制地上漲，也就是生活的鞭子，抽得格外的緊急，在今日社會經濟龐雜的景况之下，欲求生活安定，已很不容易，何况再加上疾病，有錢的人，生了病尚且不得了，藥品是這樣的缺乏，製藥的原料也同樣的一天少似一天，有錢而買不到藥，已很平常，何况貧病交迫，窮得連買藥的錢都無着呢？尤其是薪水階級，在這時候更不能生病，八口之家，或者少說一些五口之家，一個人生了病，全家可就爲難了，即使在公立醫院中可以免費診治，這筆買藥的錢，又到那裏去籌措？假如把有限的收入，悉數化在這上面，那不是全家的人都得餓着肚子麽？所以除了「硬挺」之外，簡直是束手無策。可是生病的機會也以這班薪水階級中的人爲最多，身體本來大都不很健全，加了營養不足，又减少了他們的抵抗力，抵抗力一薄弱，疾病便乘機而入，福無雙至，禍不單行，除了聽天由命之外，還有何話可說？這情形現在已很普遍，窮人愈來愈多，薪水階級差不多到了貧無立錐之地，呼籲無門，這是何等可慘的事！新星忝爲製藥業之一員，亦爲社會之一分子，目擊心傷，責無旁貸，擬竭棉薄，從事救濟，選定下列新星藥品十種，計值三百萬元，皆今日醫療上所必需之藥物，本新星「製藥不忘藥德，舊藥不忘藥格」之廠訓，獻贈社會，聊盡服務之忱：</p>

<p>（五）上列四項之直系家屬</p>
<p>（六）以上俱以家境清寒工作勤奮者爲限。</p>
<p>屆時敦請　福慶，周誠滸，余　三，余新恩，顧毓琦各醫學博士主持其事，並商　下列各大醫院，權爲分任工作：</p>
<p>一，紅十字會第一醫院　二，紅十字會第三醫院　三，廣慈醫院　四，宏仁醫院　五，同仁第二醫院　六，上海醫院　七，上海地方醫院　八，上海兒童醫院　九，四明醫院　十，濟民醫院　十一，上海工廠聯合醫院，南市救濟醫院　十三，新藥業公會第一醫院　十四，新藥業公會第二醫院　十五，上海衛生實騐區　十六，新閘衛生實騐區</p>
<p>我們明知今日社會上所需要的救濟事業，不知凡幾，迫不及待的問題，也有許多沒有解決——我們自己就有不少的問題，還需要社會來帮我們解決。——這三百萬元的助藥運動，真是杯水車薪，無補於事，所希望的是大家都出來在無辦法中間找辦法的原則下，各盡最大的能力和同情心，像我們這樣一個小小的單位，如果能够共同的集合起來，成爲一個大單位，那就比較的有力量，或許能完成吾們的願望，也未可知，　布區區，惟連察爲幸。</p>
<p>（按）新星藥廠發起的「助藥運動」，在現時確甚需要，一般貧病交迫的人，往往因無力購藥，以致呻吟床褥，痛苦萬狀。如以上所指定的救濟對象，論其身份，都是清風亮　，論其家境，則又非常清苦。不幸面罹疾病，廢時失業，豈獨是一身一家的損失：新星藥廠發起此項運動，可說是有利社會國家的義舉。甚望海上各大藥廠，亦能聞風興起，擴大組織，有統一的機構，其貢獻當更偉大。（凡適合上項資格而需要助藥者，請與上閒各醫院　治）。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Prelude to the Battle of Luzon Island Unveiled at Lingayen Gulf: Japanese Forces Bravely Intercept Enemy Landing Troops <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 8th: (1) Enemy forces invaded Lingayen Gulf on the morning of January 6th, shelling the coast of the gulf. By approximately 9:40 AM on the 9th, they began landing near San Fabian and Lingayen. (2) Local Japanese land forces engaged in fierce fighting, while Japanese air units also launched intense attacks on enemy ships.</p>
<p>Philippine Front Line Base, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - American forces finally began landing in Lingayen Gulf on the 9th. Enemy ships patrolling in front of San Fabian and Dagupan provided fierce artillery cover. The enemy fleet off Damortis and Santo Tomas dispersed in front of San Fabian at 9:00 AM, advancing directly towards the coast. At this time, a barrage of anti-aircraft fire erupted above the enemy escort fleet. Instantly, enemy ships suddenly emitted thick black smoke. By the time the smoke cleared, the warships had disappeared, undoubtedly sunk by the brave suicide attacks of Japanese special attack units. At 9:40 AM, enemy landing troops finally advanced towards both San Fabian and Lingayen. Under Japanese artillery fire, their leading boats were shattered one after another. However, the first wave of enemy landing troops continued to advance under heavy artillery cover, finally reaching the coast. In an instant, American soldiers scattered from the boats and landed, desperately rushing forward. But under the artillery fire of the Japanese positions, American soldiers fell one after another on the beach. Following the first landing force, the second wave also began to land, with fifteen or sixteen large boats of 4,000 tons each breaking through to the shore. Around noon, the sound of artillery fire rumbled, shaking the coast. The prelude to the decisive battle of Luzon Island was finally unveiled on the coast of Lingayen Gulf.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Over Thirty Enemy Ships Sunk in Waters West of Manila Bay: Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Special Attack Units Deploy Together <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Philippine Base, 10th (China News Agency dispatch) - The decisive battle in the Philippines has entered its formal stage. The enemy's intention to land on Luzon Island has been exposed. The enemy fleet, consisting of approximately one hundred landing craft and transport convoys escorted by aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and other vessels, invaded Lingayen Gulf since the 6th. Simultaneously, another large enemy fleet of over two hundred ships from the Sulu Sea was rapidly heading north. The Japanese naval special attack units and army and navy air forces, who had been seriously monitoring and waiting to intercept this enemy action, launched a fierce surprise attack. Currently, ships and air units from both sides are mixed together in the waters west of Luzon Island, engaging in a major battle. Japanese naval special attack units charged head-on into the enemy fleet moving north in the waters west of Manila Bay at dawn on the 8th, taking advantage of the enemy convoy's confusion to launch a devastating attack. It has been determined that over thirty enemy transport ships of various sizes have been sunk so far. When Japanese aircraft discovered enemy forces appearing in the Sulu Sea area, they immediately launched a fierce attack. The enemy fleet, heavily damaged, was completely thrown into chaos. The damage inflicted on the enemy by the Japanese special attack units this time was the greatest. As of the 9th, there were only about seventy enemy transport ships of various sizes in Lingayen Gulf, and the new convoy heading north from the Sulu Sea, with Manila as its center, had not yet bombed the southwestern area of Luzon Island. However, Manila and other parts of Luzon are still very calm because the Japanese army has strong defensive positions in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Philippine Front Line Base, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the 6th, the enemy fleet attempting to forcibly land on Luzon Island and invading Lingayen Gulf has suffered enormous losses after being fiercely attacked by Japanese army and navy special attack units. However, they are still seeking opportunities to land, patrolling near the Gulf's waters and continuing to bombard San Fernando with gunboats. Furthermore, the subsequent enemy transport convoys, also heading from the Sulu Sea to the western waters of Leyte Island, reappeared in the waters west of Luzon Island and disappeared on the morning of the 8th after being fiercely attacked by Japanese army and navy surface special attack units. It has been determined that over thirty enemy transport ships of various sizes have been sunk so far. In addition, the continuous attacks by Japanese surface ships have inflicted heavy damage. Currently, Japanese army and navy special attack air units and surface ships are still launching fierce attacks, and an intense air and sea battle is underway in the waters west of Luzon Island.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy forces attempting to land on the west coast of Luzon, fearing the inevitable suicide attacks of the Japanese special attack units and having lost aircraft carriers due to repeated attacks, are only using makeshift aircraft carriers to launch naval gun bombardments in the waters of Lingayen Gulf. Afterwards, they changed formation and fled out to sea, their movements extremely slow. At dawn on the 8th, the Japanese Air Force, led by army special attack units, fiercely attacked over sixty enemy ships escaping from Lingayen Gulf. One plane struck an enemy ship, and another struck an enemy battleship, causing them to sink immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Enemy Aircraft Attacking Japan's Mainland: Eleven Shot Down, Eighteen Damaged <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on the 10th: When enemy aircraft attacked the Japanese mainland on the afternoon of the 9th, the results of the Japanese interception were as follows: Eleven enemy aircraft were shot down, including four that were crashed into, and eighteen enemy aircraft were damaged. Japanese losses were five aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Sixty enemy B-29 aircraft from Mariana Island bases dispersed to attack the Kanto, Tokaido, and Kinki regions. A post-attack investigation of the interception results showed that eleven aircraft were shot down and eighteen were damaged, a total of twenty-nine, which is half of the attacking enemy aircraft. When enemy aircraft attacked on that day, Japanese air defense units immediately deployed to intercept them, launching a courageous counter-attack, pursuing enemy aircraft everywhere, and launching intense attacks, preventing the enemy aircraft from maneuvering, scattering their formations, and causing them to drop bombs blindly into the sea or mountains and flee in panic. The Japanese interception battle was extremely fierce, so important factory facilities were undamaged. Four of the enemy aircraft shot down were crashed into by Japanese air defense units in a heroic suicide attack. One of the planes involved in the crash returned to base after shooting down the enemy aircraft. Another parachuted into the sea, and its fate is unknown. Two others died heroically after the crash. A more detailed look at the results of this battle shows that about twenty enemy aircraft invaded the Kanto region, half of which were shot down, and the remaining aircraft were damaged, so most of the invading enemy aircraft were unable to return to Mariana Island bases. In this battle, Japanese losses (including aircraft involved in crashes) totaled five aircraft.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Raiding Taiwan: Twenty-Three Crashed</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from Taipei, the Taiwan region announced that 450 enemy aircraft and a small number of large aircraft flying from mainland China attacked various parts of Taiwan from 6:40 AM to 4:30 PM on the 9th. Our damage was minor, and the results of the battle, as determined so far, include fifteen enemy aircraft shot down (four of which are unconfirmed) and eight destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At 1:30 PM on the 9th, about sixty enemy B-29 aircraft flying from the Mariana Islands attacked the Japanese mainland. Approximately twenty attacked Tokyo and surrounding areas, and about forty attacked the Hokkaido area, invading in a dispersed manner. They were bravely intercepted by Japanese special attack units and air defense units, dropping bombs blindly, some even dropping bombs into the sea, making a complete spectacle of themselves. After an hour and a half, they fled south over the sea. Although some bombs were dropped near factories, there were no hits. Japanese ground forces suffered no losses. The enemy aircraft's dispersed bombing was intended to disperse Japanese interception forces, but they were ultimately repelled by the Japanese air defense units.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Wing Political Association held a meeting of parliamentary staff at its headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 9th. All staff members, including Chairman Kanemitsu, attended the meeting to discuss various matters regarding the opening of the 86th Diet session. They discussed Prime Minister Koiso's policy address and decided to appoint the following three individuals: Tsuneo Kanemitsu as Permanent Director-General for general administration and diplomacy; Yujiro Nakajima as Director-General for military supplies, labor, and transportation; and Masayoshi Kimura, Vice Chairman of the Political Research Committee, as Director-General for food and people's livelihood. These three individuals will represent the Wing Political Association and express opinions based on the policies determined by the association's various bodies to encourage the government.</p>

<p>A Certain Front Line Base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Chongqing American air fleets that attacked the Wuhan area on the afternoon of the 8th were fiercely intercepted by Japanese fighter planes. Four were shot down and twelve were destroyed. Ground fire accounted for the destruction of two, for a total of twenty aircraft destroyed. Two of the pilots of the four Chongqing American planes shot down after sustaining damage were confirmed to be Chinese pilots belonging to the Chongqing American Joint Air Force. The Americans, fearing Japanese interception, use Chinese pilots as pioneers, while the American aircraft acted as overseers, circling in the rear to ensure their own escape. This tactic of the Americans has been seen many times on land battlefields. The Americans are now even using this tactic in air combat, sacrificing other races, which is detested by both gods and men.</p>

<p>Continue to devote your strength and share in happiness.</p>
<p>We have been participating for two years. What responsibility have we fulfilled for the war effort in these two years? We ask ourselves what is different before and after participation? What procedures do we need to increase production to? We need to save on expenses. Do our clothing, food, housing, and transportation conform to the wartime system? Only by devoting one's strength can one share in happiness. We want freedom, liberation, justice, and peace. We must pay a corresponding price. Our price is to practice the New National Movement.</p>
<p>To demand liberation, one must pay the price.</p>
<p>We have been participating for two years. What responsibility have we fulfilled for the war effort in these two years? We ask ourselves what is different before and after participation? We need to increase production, to what degree? We need to economize on consumption. Do our clothing, food, housing, and transportation conform to the wartime system? Only by devoting one's labor can one share in happiness. We want freedom and liberation. We must pay a substantial price. Our price is to practice the New National Movement.</p>
<p>It has been a full three years since the Leader personally drafted the outline of the New National Movement in January of the 31st year of the Republic [1942]. In these three years, we have followed the Leader's instructions and carried out the work of the New National Movement. Although a little bit of work has accumulated to form a rough foundation, it is still very far from the Leader's expectations, and the world's war situation and the Greater East Asia war situation are becoming more serious day by day. Compatriots, the peace movement is the stage for the re-departure of the National Revolution, and the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive period. Whether we advance or retreat, whether we win or lose, depends on whether the people of the country are moving along the path of the New National Movement.</p>
<p>Shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing China.</p>
<p>If we want to revitalize China and defend East Asia, we must first have the vast majority of the people rise up to shoulder this responsibility, and to shoulder this responsibility, we must first cultivate the ability to shoulder it. Contributing little, enjoying much, planning for oneself, not being willing to exert effort for the country and nation, and lacking a sense of unity, like a heap of loose sand – these are all the bad criticisms that others give us as citizens. We do not shy away from saying that this is our inferior nature as citizens. We want to be new citizens, we no longer want to be old citizens. We want to make a total reckoning of all the thoughts and actions of the old citizens. The New National Movement is to replace the individualism of the past with nationalism, to replace the false European and American democracy with a democratic centralism system, and to replace communism with the People's Livelihood Principle [Minsheng]. Under one principle, one core ideology, loving China and loving East Asia, the 450 million people of China must possess this belief, practice this belief, and become new citizens, then China's future will have hope, and East Asia's future will have hope.</p>
<p>Promote the New Movement and redouble our efforts.</p>
<p>Before the Incident [the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937], some people advocated the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement was intended to cultivate many good individuals. All the people of China would become good people. However, it only planned from the standpoint of the individual to make them good people, which is not enough and is impossible. We must have a strong national and national concept. We must have a correct East Asian awareness of freedom. What we want to create is an outstanding citizen of the Republic of China, an outstanding East Asian nation. In East Asia, which is dominated by international imperialists, and in China, which is invaded by international imperialists, to want to keep oneself clean and to protect oneself is not only delusional but also absurd. If China does not obtain freedom and equality, all living innovation is nonsense. If East Asia is not liberated, then China's freedom and equality cannot be obtained, and even if it is obtained by chance, it cannot be guaranteed. The fundamental meaning of participation in the war lies in this, and the fundamental spirit of the peace movement also lies in this. Since the New National Movement was advocated, we have adhered to the Leader's intention to promote the New Movement. The achievements and progress of the New Movement's work in these three years have been very slow. Although various difficulties in the environment have hindered the promotion of the New Movement's work, we have kept in mind the Leader's instructions. We must speak honestly and be responsible. We are absolutely unwilling to shirk responsibility. Precisely because there have been many unsatisfactory aspects of the New Movement's work in the past, we must work harder in the future.</p>
<p>Recognize friends and enemies and choose the path.</p>
<p>I remember last October when I represented Chinese youth in Japan to visit the Leader, the Leader summoned me before his sickbed and earnestly urged us to expand the New Movement, organize and train the youth, and entrust this to our comrades. These words became the Leader's last words to our young comrades, and every word is deeply etched in our hearts. We can only promote it with the greatest determination, no matter how difficult it is, swearing by the Leader's last words. What we can tell the Leader's spirit in heaven is only to realize the Leader's last words, save China, and save East Asia. And to save China and save East Asia, we cannot rely on a small number of comrades, but on the majority of the people, and the majority of the people must become the new citizens of the country and the new patriots of East Asia.</p>
<p>We want to tell the compatriots in Chongqing and in mainland China that you are also compatriots of the Republic of China, and you also love the Republic of China that we love. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although some people think that as long as Britain and the United States counterattack, Japan can be defeated, and as long as planes are sent to bomb the peaceful areas, the people's hearts can be disturbed, perhaps this is inevitable. However, the war facts of the past three years, the hideous faces of Britain and the United States towards Chongqing, and the arrogance of the Communist Party towards Chongqing, who is a friend and who is an enemy, each person knows the water's temperature. Compatriots, compatriots across the country, with internal worries like this, and external troubles like this, strategies like this, and facts like this, where should we go in the end? We must stand firm, open our eyes, and decide the path we should take. Compatriots, China is our China, and East Asia is our East Asia. Only by following the Leader's last words and practicing the New National Movement can we revive our China and defend our East Asia. Set a firm determination, a unified step, expand the New Movement, and complete the war.</p>

<h3 id="e8">New Situation in the Philippine War <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Philippine War has had a very intense development these past few days. The enemy Americans, with Leyte Island and Mindoro Island as their centers, are invading in different directions, from Mindanao in the south, through the seas of Negros Island (i.e. Negros Island) and Panay Island, all the way to Luzon Island in the north. The scale of operations is very large, seemingly willing to make great sacrifices and bet everything on one throw.</p>
<p>Judging by the operational areas and nature of the fighting, the current Philippine War can be divided into five parts:</p>
<p>First is the land battle on Leyte Island and Mindoro Island.</p>
<p>Second is the transport war on the seas off Mindanao Island.</p>
<p>Third is the liaison war between Panay Island and Negros Island.</p>
<p>Fourth is the landing war on Luzon Island.</p>
<p>Fifth is the diversionary war outside the Philippine area, in the Taiwan Strait and the Sumatra Sea.</p>
<p>Of these five parts of the war, the fourth part, the landing war on Luzon Island, is the main focus of the enemy American operations. The most important goal of the enemy Americans is to attempt to land on Luzon Island and to want to have the decisive battle with the Japanese army on Luzon Island. Allied Prime Minister Koiso also pointed out at the cabinet meeting on January 4th that "The decisive battle of Leyte has shifted to the decisive battle of Luzon."</p>
<p>On Leyte Island and Mindoro Island, the enemy Americans are now actively engaged in consolidating their landing bases in order to form a strategic center, but the Japanese army's land forces on both islands are putting up a very strong resistance, constantly launching fierce surprise attacks on the landed enemy forces. At the same time, Japanese aircraft are also continuously carrying out destructive attacks on the enemy's airfields on the islands. As the enemy Americans are unable to consolidate their landing bases on both islands, the so-called strategic center role and mission are difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>On the Mindanao Island side, because the island is in the southernmost part of the Philippines, the enemy American reinforcements and supplies coming north from New Guinea and Australia must all pass through the seas off Mindanao and the Sulu Sea west of Mindanao, so the Japanese army is strongly engaging in a transport war against the enemy Americans there, in order to cut off the enemy's supplies. The enemy's transport convoys have been constantly subjected to heroic attacks by the Japanese forces in recent days.</p>
<p>Panay Island and Negros Island are located in the central part of the Philippine Islands, in the northeast of the Sulu Sea, northwest of Mindanao, and between Leyte Island and Mindoro Island, slightly to the south. In order to connect Leyte Island and Mindoro Island, the enemy Americans also have great ambitions for Panay Island and Negros Island, and the fighting on the seas off these two islands has been quite tense in recent days. Enemy ships have suffered heavy losses under the interception of the Japanese forces.</p>
<p>The war on the seas off Luzon is now mainly concentrated in Lingayen Gulf on the western coast of Luzon Island. The enemy is currently launching most of its forces to land near Lingayen and San Fabian (northeast end of Lingayen Gulf), in order to establish a foothold on Luzon Island. However, given the strength of the Japanese forces' resistance, the enemy's dream of landing will not be easy. Even if they do land, the sacrifices will be too great, and they will be exhausted, and in the end they will be powerless. As for the enemy's air raids on Taiwan and Okinawa, they contain the intention of showing off and disrupting the Japanese rear. Also, the appearance of the British Indian Ocean Fleet in the western seas of Sumatra also has a responsive and diversionary effect. But no matter how the enemy fights, they are encountering head-on blows from the Japanese forces everywhere. At present, the enemy, on the one hand, seems to have a fierce tone, but on the other hand, they are actually short of reserves. The longer the long-distance expedition goes on and the deeper it goes, the greater the chance of being annihilated. The strong naval and air forces of the Allied countries will surely have even greater development in the future.</p>

<p>Bengbu, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Anhui Province Governor Luo Junqiang returned to the province last week to supervise the handover of duties. After convening a meeting, he ordered that even a single tree or blade of grass must be transferred cleanly, and ordered all commissioners and county magistrates not to leave the province without authorization during the transition period, and especially not to resign lightly. Upon the announcement that Shanghai was about to be taken over, he took the fast train to Beijing at 10:00 PM on the 9th, accompanied by his secretary and a few guards. Leading figures from the party, government, and military of the province, various organizations and schools, as well as the Allied Minister of Liaison, Japanese economic advisor Harada, Consul-General Morita, the military police, and resident community, lined up in the heavy snow and cold wind to see him off. It was heard that as the train reached Mingguang, responsible officials and the people and students of each county along the way also lined up to see him off, which was unprecedented for previous provincial governors.</p>
<p>In addition, a telegram stated that Anhui Province Governor Luo Junqiang, in view of the Anhui Daily and Central News Agency Bengbu branch staff's hard work throughout the year, especially awarded a bonus of 200,000 yuan at the time of the year-end performance appraisal, which was handed over to President Liu to distribute to all staff members.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Recent Progress of the Waterway Project: Interview with Responsible Official of the Waterway Management Bureau <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Last year, the Executive Yuan's Waterway Management Bureau submitted to the Executive Yuan for the record and approval the four design changes for changing the project implementation plan, listing the reasons. The Executive Yuan considered this to be not only a matter of the project itself, but also related to the income and expenditure of funds, and specially transferred it to the Ministry of Construction for review and reply. However, the Ministry of Construction stated that the detailed drawings of the existing status and planned completion of the project according to the four design changes were all lacking, so the review work could not begin, and the Ministry of Construction reported the situation to the Executive Yuan. Upon learning the details, the Executive Yuan issued a clear order in December of last year to the Waterway Management Bureau to supplement the detailed drawings for review. It is learned that the Waterway Management Bureau has forwarded this order to the construction site to begin surveying and supplementing the detailed drawings. In order to understand the current situation of the Waterway project, the reporter specially visited the responsible official of the Waterway Management Bureau, who said: After the Waterway project signed the contract, the original completion date was the end of December from the start date, but due to difficulties in material transportation and local security, the number of workers gradually decreased, which hindered the progress of the project. Although the Waterway Management Bureau anticipated that in order to enable the project to reach a satisfactory stage, it was decided to change the four design points in order to complete it as scheduled. To date, it is estimated that 60% of the project can be completed. The contractor, Aonan Company, has requested the Waterway Management Bureau to extend the deadline to before February 15th. Now, due to rain and snow, the roads are blocked, so the details of the construction site and whether it can be completed by the deadline cannot be predicted. Today's regulations stipulate that if the contractor cannot complete the project as scheduled, they should be fined to compensate for the losses. The Waterway project has repeatedly made excuses to extend the deadline, and this issue will be resolved properly when the project is completed.</p>

<h3 id="e11">China and East Asian Nations Strive for Self-Preservation; Chairman Chen, Acting Head of State, Announces to the World Participation in the War <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Chen, the Acting Chairman of the National Government of China, issued a declaration to the world at 5 PM on the 9th, the second anniversary of China's participation in the war, urging British and American imperialists and the warlords of the Chongqing regime. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this great war, it has lasted for several years. The reason why the people of the world have suffered such unbearable pain and unprecedented disasters is none other than the insatiable ambitions of British and American imperialism. Britain usually trumpets freedom and equality, but in reality, it employs narrow-minded colonial exploitation. Their so-called colonial policy is a concrete manifestation of financial monopoly and the invasion of foreign peoples. However, this old order is on the verge of collapse due to this great war. It is hoped that the British people will quickly sweep away their Anglo-Saxon sense of superiority and their contempt for foreign races, abandon their economic monopoly policy, and recognize the lofty principle of mutual benefit and equality among nations. Then, the final victory will belong to the nations that demand self-preservation, self-defense, and co-prosperity. The same goes for the United States. The leaders of the American war are all instigated by Jewish capitalists, driving the American people onto the path of war. While the American mainland has not suffered the slightest threat, they have ignited ambitions to dominate the world, attempting to eradicate the survival of tens of millions of oppressed people who demand freedom and liberation. Their arrogance is truly infuriating.</p>
<p>Sharing Hardships, Sharing the Same Goal</p>
<p>Regarding our comrades in Chongqing, for the past twenty years, we have been jointly inheriting the last will of the Founding Father, working towards the same goal of completing the great revolutionary cause, and sharing hardships together. Today, it is merely a difference of opinion in the process. Fortunately, under my leadership as chairman, China has continued to strive for freedom and equality, reaching a point where the foundation for restoring sovereignty has been laid. Therefore, in order to safeguard sovereignty, domestic unification is essential as soon as possible. The unequal treaties have now been abolished, and concessions have also been recovered. This fact gradually proves the ardent assistance of our ally Japan to China. China and the nations of Greater East Asia are currently striving for the self-preservation of their nations and the co-prosperity of mankind, continuing to fight alongside Japan and Manchukuo. Our future shines brightly, and the aggressive ambitions of Britain and the United States will inevitably fail. In this turmoil, only by adhering to the principles of international justice and mutual benefit and equality can we achieve a future of co-prosperity. Under this new order, all nations can attain lasting peace.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Director Izubuchi Reveals Enemy America's Ambitions; Utilizing the Chongqing Faction to Wage War Against Japan <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (10th) at 3 PM, Director Izubuchi of the Army Press Department of our ally Japan in Shanghai, held a regular press conference on the Bund at the Hua Mao Hotel, on the eighth floor, and immediately revealed the tragedy of Chongqing suffering difficulties due to being utilized by enemy America. His statement is as follows:</p>
<p>Chongqing's Military Strength Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army's offensive operations on the mainland last year, the Chongqing faction has suffered extremely heavy losses. All of its land producing agricultural and mineral products has been completely damaged. The total or partial loss of its military strength amounts to more than sixty divisions. Those suffering considerable losses also number over two hundred and thirty-eighty thousand. The loss of armaments is equivalent to thirty to forty divisions, and the loss of bullets is equivalent to forty to fifty divisions.</p>
<p>Enemy America's Assistance to Chongqing Has Ulterior Motives</p>
<p>After suffering this major blow, the Chongqing faction has increasingly strengthened its reliance on the United States, reorganized its troops, strengthened conscription, and mobilized students. The military and political sides have joined forces in an attempt to reverse the decline and restore independent resistance. However, the purpose of American aid to Chiang is to utilize Chongqing's manpower and resources to wage war against Japan. At the end of last year, the US Supreme Command sent liaison officers to various units within the Chongqing faction, attempting to place the Chongqing troops under American command and attempting to land in southeastern China. However, the Chongqing faction hopes to borrow American assistance and fight on its own, which runs counter to American ambitions. This kind of contradictory situation is nothing short of a major tragedy for the Chongqing faction. Its pitiful state is imaginable.</p>
<p>Japanese Army's Operations Achieve Successive Victories</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army bravely fought in southwestern Guizhou and northern Vietnam, it has achieved successive victories, creating a posture of attacking Chongqing. It is expected that considerable results will be achieved within this year. In the future, the United States plans to use the Chinese mainland as a decisive battlefield and utilize Chongqing's manpower and resources to fight. However, Chongqing's military strength will definitely not withstand a single blow from the Japanese army, and its ultimate annihilation by the Japanese army is beyond doubt.</p>
<h3 id="e13">North China Holds Commemoration of War Participation <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Various institutions and organizations, such as the North China Political Affairs Commission and the New People's Society, held commemoration events on the 9th, the second anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, to unite the determination of the 100 million people of North China and strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. A mass rally was held at the New New Theater on the 10th, with more than 2,000 people participating. Following that, a war-strengthening symposium and a youth total mobilization consultation meeting will be held on the 15th. The above events are all hosted by the Central General Assembly of the New People's Society. At the same time, the Beijing General Assembly of the New People's Society is also hosting a student debate. Meanwhile, the Pacification General Headquarters of the North China Political Affairs Commission held a military parade of the Pacification Army at 10 AM in the square in front of the Taihe Gate. Chairman Wang and Superintendent Du of the Pacification General Headquarters both personally attended. In the afternoon, a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers of the Pacification Army. Following that, the Pacification Army paraded through the city in formation. In addition, there were various commemorative lectures and broadcasts, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Legitimate Commerce Protected by Legal Rights <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the central authorities regarded increasing production as one of the essential requirements for adapting to the wartime economic system last year, the relevant authorities have actively encouraged agriculture, industry, and commerce, striving to revitalize them and supporting their entry into the right track, in order to increase production and ensure that both military needs and people's livelihoods can be met. In order to understand what kind of countermeasures the authorities will take this year for various commercial companies and other organizations to continue to complete the work of increasing production, this reporter specifically interviewed the person in charge of the relevant department. According to the conversation, most commercial companies were extremely satisfied because some enterprise companies were not well-organized, mostly taking the name of speculation and hoarding in order to seek illegal profits, which caused prices to rise and people's livelihoods to be affected. Later, after several adjustments by the authorities, those with unsound organizations gradually eliminated. Thus, legitimate businesses are protected by the legal rights of the authorities and can develop normally. Therefore, this year, based on past situations, we will still follow the previous policies. All legitimate businesses will not only be registered, but also given strong legal protection, in order to achieve the established policy of increasing production, so that military needs can be met and people's livelihoods can be stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Change of Minister of Transportation in Chongqing <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Chongqing faction had previously established a wartime transportation bureau, appointing former Minister of Transportation Yu Feipeng as its first director, but now it has changed again, and Yu Feipeng has been transferred to the position of Minister of Transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Revision of Provisional Regulations for the Management of the Aquatic Products Industry <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) - The provisional regulations for the management of the aquatic products industry have been revised and promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and instructed the Aquatic Products Administration to implement them accordingly. Liu Weijun, the director of the administration, expressed his opinions on the administration's aquatic products administration, as follows:</p>
<p>"The revised provisional regulations for the management of the aquatic products industry have been issued to the administration. The administration is currently preparing to implement them in accordance with the various regulations. The current work plans to first conduct registration of the aquatic products industry. The aquatic products industries that should be registered include steamers and engine boats, fishing, fixed-net fishing, various net fishing, angling, aquaculture, miscellaneous fishing, and seaweed and shellfish harvesting. The ice industries that should be registered include the transportation and sale of aquatic products, aquatic products cooperatives, fish markets, fish brokers, aquatic product manufacturing and storage, refrigeration, and fishing gear manufacturing. Generally, merchants often regard registration as a daunting task. I also pay close attention to this point. I would also like to solemnly declare that, in handling the matter, I will uphold the spirit of Minister Chen's integrity and dedication to public service and earnestly handle the matter. If any personnel are found to be disobeying orders, they will be severely punished and will not be tolerated. I also hope that all relevant parties will report them at any time and cooperate to ensure that corruption is eliminated."</p>
<h3 id="e17">Directors of Various District Income Tax Bureaus Hold Office Affairs Conference <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) - In order to review past tax policies and promote future policies, the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance specially convened the directors of various district collection bureaus to Shanghai to hold the fifth office affairs conference yesterday (10th) at 10 AM. Except for those who were unable to attend due to inconvenient transportation or leave of absence, the directors of various districts attended the meeting, including:</p>
<p>Directors Attending the Meeting</p>
<p>Including Luo Guangxu, Director of the Shanghai District Collection Bureau. Deputy Director Zhou Guo. Ge Zhigan, Director of the Huaihai District Bureau. Huang Yinnan, Director of the Suzhou District Bureau. Qiu Zewu, Representative of the Director of the Beijing District Bureau. Song Baoxuan, Director of the Wuhu District Bureau. Zhang Tianwen, Director of the Nantong District Bureau. Wu Xi Han, Director of the Bengbu District Bureau. Xie Xueying, Director of the Hangzhou District Bureau.

Section Chief Yang Guangbing and other twenty people. First, Qiu Fangmo, Director of the Income Tax Department,</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>The general idea is that since the opening of this tax, under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance and the efforts of the various district bureaus, there has been progress over the years. However, due to the central government's huge expenditure during the war, the approved estimate of income tax for the first half of this year is quite large. The responsibility this year is greater than in previous years. I hope that the directors attending the meeting will carefully explore and gather the wisdom of the group to carry out the work. The collection achievements in the first half of the year should be assessed and adjusted so as to increase tax revenue. Subsequently, the Secretary-General of the General Assembly reported</p>
<p>Proposals of the General Assembly</p>
<p>A total of thirty-five items, including twenty-four tax-related proposals and eleven proposals on expenses and other matters, were decided to be divided into two groups: (1) Tax Affairs Department, (2) Expenses and other New York Group, for separate review. The review meeting will be held at 2 PM. Luo Guangxu was elected as the convener of the Tax Affairs Group, and Huang Yin was elected as the convener of the Expenses and other Groups. Only a small part of the proposals were reviewed by 5 PM, so the proposal review will continue at 10 AM this morning (11th), and the review proposals will be collected and sorted out in the afternoon, and the meeting will continue tomorrow (12th) to discuss and review the proposals.</p>

<p>No More Than Three Reasons</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telegram from Washington, the US national debt was only 29,400,000,000 yuan in 1929, increased to 151,800,000,000 yuan in 1943, and increased to 232,000,0000,000 yuan last year. A reporter from the London Economist magazine compared the difference between US public debt and private debt, which was only 22.1% in 1940, but soared to 53.8% by the end of 1943. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) The government's huge military spending plan has increased the income of enterprises and workers, and debt has been reduced accordingly. (2) At the same time, the government has also reduced the need for private companies to borrow. (3) Lack of raw materials is enough to limit the investment of private capital.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Current State of Education in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>While this reporter was in Jiangsu, I had the opportunity to attend the "Third Wartime Education Conference of Jiangsu Province." At the invitation of Director Yuan Shu of the Education Department, I was fortunate to be present, though in a humble position, and to hear the insightful views of various officials from Jiangsu Province and allied nations. I was particularly pleased. Having also served in the education sector myself for many years, I was extremely interested in this conference. The conference concluded last year (December 26th), and I am writing this article to share what I observed and my own humble opinions, to provide reference for those concerned with education.</p>
<p>Looking Back</p>
<p>"Education" bears the mission of cultivating talent for a century, and has a profound impact on the rise and fall of the nation and the fate of the people. Before 1937, education in Jiangsu Province was well-developed, and it deserved the reputation as a "province of culture." After the war, there were significant changes. Although dedicated educators have made efforts and the provincial education authorities have worked hard to promote it, there has been some recovery. However, qualitatively, it is still lacking.</p>
<p>Prevalence of Private Schools</p>
<p>An increase in the number of schools in a province should be a symbol of educational development, but a closer analysis reveals otherwise. Currently, private schools are abnormally developed in Jiangsu Province. These schools have rudimentary equipment that does not meet standards, and most of them are "commercialized" in nature. They only know how to attract students to enrich their own pockets and do not care about anything else, let alone contribute to education. Such "academic shops" are everywhere. Among them, there are some with relatively substantial scale and some achievements, but these are few in number.</p>
<p>According to the "Overview of Elementary Education in Jiangsu Province" recently compiled by the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, there are currently a total of 2,225 elementary schools in the province, of which 5 are provincial, 1,767 are county-run, and 453 are private. County-run schools are the most numerous, followed by private schools, and provincial schools are the fewest. The opposite is true for secondary education. Currently, the province has 11 provincial secondary schools, 2 normal schools, 4 vocational schools, 1 Japanese language school, and 19 county-run secondary schools. There are as many as 58 private secondary schools in the province. The disparity in numbers is clear at a glance. The main reason for the proliferation of private schools has already been mentioned. As for provincial and county-run schools, their number has remained stagnant and has even decreased recently. The reason for this is nothing more than the province's financial difficulties, and the fact that successive administrations have often regarded "education" as a less important part of their administrative scope. It is no wonder that the progress of "educational" facilities lags behind other areas.</p>
<p>Overview of Funding</p>
<p>Last year, education funding in Jiangsu Province accounted for only a little over 6.27% of the province's total expenditure. Although the increase in this figure over the past five years cannot be said to be slow, it is incomparable to the skyrocketing rise in the cost of living. According to the Jiangsu Provincial Education Expenditure for 1940, the total amount of provincial and county funds was 3,700,489 yuan. In 1941, it increased by 2,442,381 yuan. In 1942, it was 3,890,089 yuan. In 1943, it was 48,048,458 yuan. In 1944, it was 255,622,341 yuan. The total expenditure for 1944 was 303,670,799 yuan. Looking at the above-mentioned increases over the years, the amount for 1944 is almost a hundred times greater than the amount for 1940. However, compared to the soaring prices, the difference is more than a thousand miles.</p>
<p>Since education funding and the rising cost of living are like the tortoise and the hare in a race, it has a major impact on the livelihood of teachers and staff. Currently, the highest salary for a provincial elementary school teacher is 3,350 yuan (based on a base salary of 190 yuan), and the lowest is 1,450 yuan (based on a base salary of 120 yuan). For provincial secondary school teachers, the highest is 5,180 yuan (based on teaching 26 hours of courses), and the lowest is 2,300 yuan (based on teaching 12 hours). Private schools each have their own policies, so we will not discuss them for now. If we look at the "Statistics on Income and Loss per Yuan of Expenditure for Educational Personnel" compiled by the Jiangsu Education Department in mid-November 1944, according to this most realistic and scientific statistical table, we can see that for the highest-paid secondary school teachers, their income is only 0.36 yuan for every yuan of living expenses, with a loss of 0.64 yuan. For the lowest-paid teachers, their income is only 0.19 yuan for every yuan of living expenses, with a loss of 0.81 yuan. For elementary school teachers, the income of the highest-paid teachers, according to the above situation, is only 0.23 yuan, with a loss of 0.77 yuan. The income of the lowest-paid teachers is 0.19 yuan, with a loss of 0.81 yuan. According to the Education Department's recent budget, the highest-paid secondary school teachers could receive 5,860 yuan per month from August to October 1944, and 6,560 yuan per month from November 1st. However, according to the minimum cost of living in October, their expenses were 12,000 yuan. After October, due to the sharp rise in prices, it has increased to 18,000 yuan. The huge difference between income and expenditure is as such. From this, we can imagine the difficult living conditions of general teachers and staff.</p>
<p>Lack of Qualified Teachers</p>
<p>In the past, due to the threat to their livelihoods, many teachers and staff changed to other professions. Those who remained were often unqualified and incompetent, which had a significant impact on the studies of children and young people. It is said that previously, when government offices screened teachers, they implemented examinations. As a result, 90% of the candidates either had incomplete certificates or insufficient experience. If strictly enforced, there would be a severe shortage of qualified candidates, so they had to compromise, resulting in the current mixed and messy lineup. However, many of these people lack interest in education and only have a "better than nothing" attitude, perfunctorily fulfilling their responsibilities. Some even take on courses at several schools to increase their income. Because they are unable to be in multiple places at once, they have to implement a rotation system of skipping classes. It is reported that in a certain secondary school in Suzhou, from September to November, there were more than 360 class cancellations. The disorganization is evident.</p>
<p>Since most teachers are passively accepting their fate and indifferent to students' studies, constantly preoccupied with solving their livelihood problems, they have no time to improve their own knowledge. Therefore, students' performance will inevitably be poor. It is reported that previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Education Authority held a writing competition for secondary school students. After grading the papers, it was found that some papers had not been corrected by the teachers. This provides a glimpse of the situation.</p>
<p>Teachers' Lives</p>
<p>The education sector in Jiangsu has reached a critical point. Fortunately, at this critical moment, the authorities have established the "Teachers' Livelihood Subsidy Committee" and the "Teachers' Livelihood Insurance Committee," which are like life-saving medicines for the critically ill education sector in Jiangsu. We sincerely hope that the competent authorities will take greater determination to implement fundamental solutions for the long-term. Here are a few points based on my own humble opinions:</p>
<p>(1) The suffering of teachers' lives is beyond the imagination of most people. If we want to improve education, we must first start by stabilizing the lives of teachers. The best way to address the root cause is to implement a system of in-kind distribution of salaries for teachers and staff. If we can plan comprehensively and obtain the cooperation of relevant agencies, this measure can be easily implemented.</p>
<p>(2) In addition, we should also implement "revenue generation" measures for education funding. Jiangsu's education sector has 110,000 mu of academic land. We should use decisive measures to investigate this land and prevent local bullies from continuing to control it. If so, the 220 million yuan in academic land revenue would be like life-saving nectar for the people in the Jiangsu education sector who have been suffering for so long.</p>
<p>(3) According to the wartime education plan, we should implement production education. Although there are already a few schools (such as the Jiangsu Education Institute, where students' food and vegetables are self-sufficient, and the Suzhou Provincial Vocational School, which implements paper making) that have already implemented it and have achieved results, we should vigorously promote it universally or force its implementation so that we can contribute to wartime production. In this way, both education and production can reduce the burden on students' parents.</p>
<p>(4) In terms of teachers, we should also quickly eliminate those who are unqualified or disloyal. After raising salaries and stabilizing their lives, we should try our best to recruit outstanding individuals. At the same time, we should establish "Teachers' Mutual Reading Clubs" so that they can engage in academic discussions and research in addition to teaching. This is crucial to the future of education.</p>
<p>(5) If we want to achieve twice the result with half the effort, we must break down the barriers between the competent authorities, local officials, and schools. We must ensure that the situation at the bottom is communicated to the top and that everyone works together to reverse this critical situation. Otherwise, even with wise and competent officials like Director Yuan, they will not be able to help.</p>
<p>The above are my humble opinions. I have selected the most important ones and presented them to the Jiangsu authorities for reference. (Sent from Suzhou)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Five Organizations Gave Farewell Yesterday to Officials Transferred to Municipal Government, Secretary-General Wu Expressed Three Hopes <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, and the Shanghai Sushan Association jointly held a tea party yesterday (10th) afternoon at the Kangle Restaurant to bid farewell and express gratitude to Municipal Secretary-General Wu, Director Sun of the Relocation Office, Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau, Director Xu of the Economic Bureau, Director Ye of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Director Feng of the Goods Allocation Office, who have served the city diligently and have recently been transferred to other positions. In addition to the aforementioned guests of honor, over a hundred guests from various circles and municipal officials, including Director Dai, Director Fan, Director Zhang, Councilor Pan, Councilor Cheng, Councilor Zhang, Councilor Ling, Yan Fuying, Ding Fubao, Shen Siliang, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhou Bangjun, Luo Nezhai, and Pei Yunqing, attended, and were personally received by Li Sihao, Wen Lanting, Yuan Lvdeng, Lin Kanghou, and Chen Lin. The event began with a speech by Chairman Li Sihao, who briefly stated that the five organizations, including the Municipal Advisory Committee, were expressing their gratitude and bidding farewell to Secretary-General Wu and the directors of various bureaus for their efforts in governing the city for the benefit of the citizens, and hoped that the officials would continue to assist with various issues in Shanghai in the future.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu Delivered a Speech on Behalf</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu then delivered a speech on behalf of the attendees, briefly stating, "I express my gratitude for the sincere cooperation of the Advisory Committee and the business community in the past. The newly appointed Secretary-General has very good political standing, experience, and ability. I hope that you will assist the new official in the same way that you assisted us in the past, and then all the problems in Shanghai will be solved smoothly. Finally, I express three hopes: First, although the municipal health and hygiene issues are not as important as the people's livelihood and price issues, Shanghai has always paid great attention to municipal health and hygiene in the past because it was an international city. I hope that we can maintain the original strengths in the future. Second, financial independence and the establishment of a budget system. There was a good scale in the concession era in the past, and I hope it will be maintained. This system is not an Anglo-American system, but a system commonly used in the world. Third, there are many problems that need to be solved in Shanghai today. It is necessary for the Chinese and Japanese authorities and civil leaders to cooperate to gradually solve them." Yuan Lvdeng gave a speech at the end, and the meeting adjourned at around 4:00 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Winter Relief Committee Inspects Congee Distribution Centers <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government's 1944 Winter Relief Committee has established nine congee distribution centers, providing congee to 9,000 people daily. The distribution began on December 25th of the previous year and has been ongoing for half a month. In order to understand the status of the relief efforts and conduct on-site inspections of the conditions at each center, the committee's Deputy Director Chen Riping, Relief Group Director Jin Wuwen, and General Affairs Group Director Sun Guangdi (representing Shen Wenyuan) set off from the Municipal Government at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (10th) and visited the congee distribution centers in Nanshi, Xujiahui, Zhabei, and Hongkou for on-site inspections. The results indicated that the following three points still need improvement: (1) The congee distribution time could be shortened to avoid the problem of people receiving congee from two places at the same time. (2) The amount of rice and firewood used varies slightly and should be further standardized. (3) Firewood is the main fuel, and the current price of firewood is expensive, making it one of the main expenses for congee distribution. Ways to improve economic efficiency and save money should be explored. The number of people receiving congee at each center is as follows: Center 1: 1,546 people, Center 2: 978 people, Center 3: 800 people, Center 4: 1,000 people, Center 5: 1,000 people, Center 6: 500 people, Center 7: 1,000 people, Center 8 (not visited), Center 9: 500 people. Except for Center 1, which has a surplus and plans to reserve it for the poor in the winter shelter, the other centers have a surplus. Poor people in the vicinity can register at the original Salvation Army site at 630 Maohai Road, Hongkou, to receive congee. If people from all walks of life have any opinions or criticisms about the Winter Relief Committee's facilities, they can send a letter directly to the committee, or they can send it through this newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Inauguration of Datong Enterprise - Donation of a Large Sum from Congratulatory Gifts <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Datong Enterprise Bank's Board of Directors organized a special fundraising team, which raised 300,000 yuan. The bank moved to a new location and opened on the 5th of this month. Congratulatory guests filled the doors, numbering over three thousand people. On that day, the bank received deposits of 150 million yuan from customers and 470 million yuan from fellow banks. This clearly demonstrates the bank's reputation for business integrity. Furthermore, Mr. Ta Pengnian, the General Manager of the bank, has extensive social connections and a significant position in the financial world, leading to rapid business growth. Recognizing the importance of education and aiming to practice frugality, the bank converted all congratulatory gifts into cash, totaling 1,500,170 yuan. Of this amount, 300,000 yuan each was donated to the *Shen Bao* Education Fund and the *Xinwen Bao* Student Loan Fund. The remainder was donated to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association. The former initiative will educate several outstanding talents for the country, while the latter will nurture several useful children for the country. Both are acts of charity with positive significance. The bank's enthusiasm in promoting and responding to the concept of donating congratulatory gifts to support education is particularly commendable. In addition to expressing our gratitude to the bank, we hope that the city's industrial and commercial sectors will also economize on extravagant celebrations in the future and donate to meaningful charitable causes. This will benefit the nation and society, so why not do it?</p>

<h3 id="e35">Suppression of Usury <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Peng</p>
<p>The current skyrocketing prices in Shanghai, which seem to have no end, are certainly due to the shortage of supplies, the stagnation of production, transportation difficulties, currency inflation, and the manipulation by cartels. However, it is also important to recognize that there is another dark side to Shanghai's economy, and that is the rampant usury that has emerged recently. With usury, the cost of goods increases, and the ultimate burden is still passed on to the consumer. If we want prices not to rise, how can we allow this? Therefore, when we talk about suppressing prices today, there are many ways to do so, but suppressing usury is an urgent task that cannot be delayed!</p>
<p>A year ago, the publicly agreed monthly interest rate for Shanghai's money houses was only around 3%, and at that time, commentators already considered their interest rates high. Who knew that since last year, short-term loans have been increasing monthly, reaching 8% by the end of the year (which is equivalent to 80 yuan of interest per month for every 1,000 yuan). In reality, such high interest rates are not available unless the borrower has a deep relationship with the directors of the money house. Politely, 2% or 3% is added to the publicly agreed interest rate as a handling fee; some even settle at 12% or 13%. The so-called black market for interest rates has become an open secret. In addition, there are some people who secretly operate bill-discounting businesses. The term is as short as five or seven days, and the interest must be deducted in advance. The interest rate is as high as 170 to over 200 yuan per month for every 1,000 yuan. The interest they charge is far greater than the "loan sharking" practiced by Indians in the past. This causes general cargo owners and business operators, especially the so-called "independent brokers," to bear such heavy interest, which implicitly increases costs. Merchants seek profit from capital, so they will not sell at a loss. Naturally, prices rise step by step! Everyone blames the heavy layers of checkpoints along the way to Shanghai for extortion, which increases costs. But who knows that cargo owners feel the same pain about the burden of interest on loans as they do about the heavy levies along the way!</p>
<p>Because the bill-discounting business is good and the interest is high, in the last six months, a bill-discounting business has been added to the 360 lines of business. These friends can collect tens of millions of yuan in interest each month by simply gathering several hundred thousand yuan in capital and a ledger. Three days to one deduction, five days to one turnover, they are doing everything they can to exploit. Such unscrupulous activities that harm the social economy by making money without working should not be allowed under a wartime economic system.</p>
<p>Originally, usury and high prices are both products of the same economic environment. Therefore, to suppress prices, it is also necessary to suppress usury. What is most fortunate is that the new mayor who presides over Shanghai's administration is also the highest authority in charge of the nation's finances. Therefore, having the new mayor eliminate this dark side of Shanghai's economy will surely be twice as effective with half the effort. We hope that: (1) Beyond the publicly disclosed interest rates of Shanghai's money houses, no handling fees or other names should be added, and the bad habits of the black market should not be followed. Perhaps people in the financial world will use the excuse of increased expenses that cannot be made up to justify raising interest rates. It should be known that these words can only fool outsiders. In fact, last year, almost every money house in Shanghai with more deposits had considerable surpluses! (2) The abuse of the term "discounting" should be suppressed. Currently, the so-called discounting of many money houses is simply nonsensical. It cannot help but make friends who have been actively promoting acceptance drafts and bill discounting feel discouraged over the years. Their so-called discounting is the same as the bill-discounting that caused a major disaster decades ago, which was a strict prohibition for the industry. They only care about heavy profits, drinking poison to quench their thirst. Once they encounter an accident, it will inevitably affect the entire economic machinery. It is hoped that the new mayor can restrain the money industry and engage in self-discipline, and no longer engage in nominal discounting business. Tickets that do not involve commercial transactions — especially bad checks — absolutely have no room for discounting. (3) Illegal usury between private individuals must be strictly prohibited. According to the law, heavy exploitation has always been prohibited. The civil law has a maximum limit for interest rates, and exceeding this limit is illegal and has no effect. Moreover, during wartime, it should not be allowed to increase the burden on debtors and endanger the social economy with heavy interest. Private operations of discounting are also not allowed under the wartime financial management regulations and must be included in the list of strict prohibitions.</p>
<p>We believe that if usury can be reduced — at least so that it does not run rampant again — it will make a considerable contribution to the work of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. If we sit idly by as usury runs rampant and do not suppress it, it will inevitably cause high prices and usury to be both the cause and the effect, and mutually promote each other, which is definitely not the good fortune of the people of Shanghai!</p>
<h3 id="e36">"Blood Stains the Sky" Preview Screening Yesterday - Lieutenant Salt Field Attends and Speaks <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The "Blood Stains the Sky" preview screening, co-organized by China Film Company and China Daily, was held at the Huguang Grand Theater yesterday morning. No less than several thousand people from all walks of life attended. Lieutenant Salt Field of the Allied Fleet News Department attended and gave a speech, elaborating in detail on the current Pacific war situation. He briefly stated: The enemy American forces have suffered unexpected blows in the battle for the Philippines. Recently, they landed in Lingayen Bay on Luzon Island, but they have been on the verge of collapse due to the strong counterattack of the Japanese army. Because the enemy American supply line is getting longer and longer, it is becoming more and more difficult to fight. On the other hand, the Japanese army has a very short supply line, which makes it more convenient for them to fight, so they can be sure of victory. Finally, he also encouraged everyone to rise up together and jointly destroy the ambition of the British and Americans to dominate East Asia and make it a secondary colony.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Rationalization of Rice Rationing <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Due to the needs of war, material shortages and the implementation of a rationing system are inevitable phenomena in any country participating in the war. Therefore, the citizens of this period must not only strive to produce, but also live frugally, eat less, and work harder to achieve final victory. However, this situation has a certain limit. In principle, no matter how small the rationed items are, they must be sufficient to meet the minimum needs of life. And the most important thing is fairness. Rich and poor are treated equally, and there are no special classes in the country. It is said, "Do not worry about scarcity, but worry about inequality." Inequality is indeed most likely to arouse resentment among the people and breed great crises!</p>
<p>But regrettably, the situation in China is exactly like this. Although rationing is implemented, it is not comprehensive. The quantity of rationed items is insufficient, and the rationing period is inaccurate. The people's minimum living needs rely on the black market outside the control system. As for distribution, the distributors are also generally providing fair distribution, but because of the special circumstances of Chinese society, the recipients feel that it is unequal. Because the wealthy live lavishly and comfortably, they do not need rations at all. Even if they are rationed, they discard them like worn-out shoes. But the poor and needy need them very much, and they look forward to them with bated breath, fearing that they will not be enough. With such a situation, it is naturally unreasonable to adopt universal rationing.</p>
<p>At present, all kinds of rationed items have the above-mentioned shortcomings, and rice is particularly prominent. Because rice is the main food of the people, whether the rationing is sufficient or not can directly affect prices and people's livelihoods. In the past, although the rice rationing agencies have changed several times, they have mostly followed the rules and regulations without reforming the rice rationing system. The most obvious shortcomings of the old system are: 1. Insufficient quantity. 2. Inaccurate rationing period. 3. Non-uniform rice quality. 4. Unreasonable distribution. The first two items directly threaten the people's livelihood and cause prices to skyrocket, the black market to run rampant, and affect the citizens' trust in the rice rationing agencies. The third item, non-uniform rice quality, gives rice merchants an opportunity to cheat, and makes citizens suffer invisibly. As for the last item, whether the distribution is reasonable or not is especially important. Regarding this point, there is a more detailed discussion in the December 5th *Shen Bao* editorial column "Priority-Based Rice Rationing": "The current rice rationing system is most likely to make people feel that there are shortcomings that have not been fully addressed. In addition to the insufficient quantity and the inaccurate period, there is also the unreasonable distribution. Because the quantity is insufficient and the period is inaccurate, distribution is particularly important to be reasonable in order to compensate. ... In terms of distribution, an absolutely universal method cannot be adopted, and there should be reasonable distinctions and priority-based rationing. ..."</p>
<p>What is the most reasonable distribution? In other words: What is priority-based rationing? In principle: It is to increase the rationing quantity for those who really need it and those who should maintain their needs so that they have enough to meet their living needs. Others will have their rationing stopped altogether. We hope that the competent authorities can thoroughly adjust the rationing system and implement priority-based rationing to compensate for the shortcomings of insufficient quantity and inaccurate rationing period in the past, so that the people's food can be on the right track and eliminate the black market to relieve the people's plight.</p>
<p>As for the implementation plan for priority-based rice rationing, what standards should be followed for distribution in order to be reasonable? It is difficult to plan accurately. Regarding this point, the author's idea is as follows:</p>
<p>As for whether this method is the most standard and reasonable, I hope that wise people will not hesitate to give advice, conduct joint research, and improve it.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Rationalized Rice Rationing Method <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(1) The rice rationing objects can be divided into four classes: A, B, C, and D. The rationing quantity and period are determined accordingly.</p>
<p>A. All households engaged in war production and serving more than two people are classified as Class A.</p>
<p>B. All personnel engaged in civilian production and specially serving the country and society, or only one person serving in a military factory, are classified as Class B.</p>
<p>C. Wage earners and laborers connected to society should be classified as Class C.</p>
<p>D. Widows, elderly, orphans, and refugees who cannot earn a living are classified as Class D.</p>
<p>All other wealthy classes and unemployed vagrants will have their rationing stopped.</p>
<p>(2) The rationing quantity is the largest for Class A, and decreases in order. However, the quantity should not be less than the minimum living needs of Class C in principle. As for Class D, it may be rationed less. Charitable organizations can solicit donations from wealthy people in society and directly purchase and transport them from rice-producing areas to supplement them.</p>
<p>(3) The rationing period is directly proportional to the quantity. Class A has the longest period, and shortens accordingly. For example, Class A is rationed once a month, Class B and C are rationed once every 20 days, and Class D is rationed once every 10 or 15 days.</p>
<p>(4) Once the rationing quantity and its limit are announced, they should not be changed easily to maintain credibility. As for prices, they should not be adjusted frequently to stimulate other prices. The competent authorities may set a standard price, stipulating that it will not be increased within a certain period. For example, if 8,000 yuan per dan is set as an example, the price will not be increased between January and March of the 34th year of the Republic of China; after April, it can be gradually increased according to the cost; and then adjusted again after June. The people will understand the difficulties of the competent authorities and naturally accept it. Do not increase the price arbitrarily.</p>
<p>(5) The rationing method is currently based on households. After implementing priority-based rationing, it can be based on group rationing: Class A is based on military factories as a unit. Class B is based on civilian factories, schools, and governments as a unit. Class C is based on commercial associations as a unit. Class D is based on charitable organizations as a unit.</p>
<p>The competent authorities can stipulate a time. If each unit group needs to be rationed rice, they can apply within the period, reporting the number of people and the total amount of rice. Overdue applications will not be approved. Later, rice tickets can be distributed to each unit and then redistributed. This allows the distributor and the recipient to have sufficient contact. If there are any increases, changes, or movements, they should also be reported by each unit to be checked against the household registration of the Baojia.</p>
<p>(6) The quality of the rationed rice should be clearly stipulated in the future, and ambiguous words should be avoided. It is best to ration one kind of rice so that rice merchants cannot cheat.</p>
<p>(Appendix: The reason why Class A is only allowed for those who serve in military factories with more than two people is nothing more than a kind of reward. In fact, Class B and C are the most common rationing objects)</p>
<p>The above six methods are all rough outlines. Other problems await the review of the competent authorities. If they can be implemented one by one, it will not only stabilize people's livelihoods, increase production, but also correct the social extravagance, eliminate the black market, prevent hoarding, and force unemployed vagrants to return to their hometowns and leave Shanghai because of rice restrictions, thereby achieving the purpose of dispersing the population. There are many benefits in one move, depending on whether the competent authorities can sincerely reform.</p>

<h3 id="e45">New Star Pharmaceutical Factory Launches Medicine Assistance Campaign, Selecting Ten Types of Medicines Worth Three Million Yuan, Specially Contracting Sixteen Hospitals to Handle Separately <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>A letter from New Star Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory states: "Respected Sir/Madam: Recently, prices have risen limitlessly, which is like a whip lashing life extra urgently. Under the current complex social and economic conditions, seeking a stable life is already difficult, let alone adding illness. Even the rich suffer when they get sick, and medicine is so scarce, with the raw materials for making medicine becoming less and less each day. It is common for the rich to be unable to buy medicine even with money, let alone those who are poor and sick, so poor that they cannot even afford to buy medicine? Especially for the salaried class, they cannot afford to get sick at this time. For a family of eight, or even a smaller family of five, if one person gets sick, the whole family is in trouble. Even if they can receive free diagnosis and treatment in public hospitals, where will they find the money to buy medicine? If they spend all their limited income on this, wouldn't the whole family have to go hungry? So, besides 'toughing it out,' they are simply helpless. However, the salaried class is most likely to get sick. Their bodies are generally not very healthy, and with insufficient nutrition, their resistance is reduced. Once their resistance is weakened, disease takes the opportunity to invade. Misfortunes never come singly. Besides resigning themselves to fate, what else can they say? This situation is now very common. There are more and more poor people, and the salaried class is almost destitute, with no way to appeal. How tragic this is! New Star, as a member of the pharmaceutical industry and a member of society, feels heartbroken at the sight of this and cannot shirk its responsibility. We plan to do our utmost to provide relief, selecting the following ten types of New Star medicines, valued at a total of three million yuan, all of which are essential medicines in today's medical treatment. Following New Star's factory motto of 'Making medicine without forgetting medical ethics, using old medicine without forgetting its quality,' we donate these to society to show our sincerity in serving:</p>
<p>1.  New Sinthiazol Ampules</p>
<p>2.  New Sinthiazol Tablets</p>
<p>3.  New Sinthiazol Powder</p>
<p>4.  Benzylamid Ampules</p>
<p>5.  Pasulfamide Tablets</p>
<p>6.  Calglute Ampules</p>
<p>7.  Isalax Tablets</p>
<p>8.  Pautonin Tablets</p>
<p>9.  New Star Ointment N.S.</p>
<p>10. Jensenco Pills</p>
<p>The target beneficiaries are: (1) The salaried class serving in the industrial and commercial sectors; (2) Scientific and technical personnel in academic institutions; (3) Teachers in schools at all levels; (4) Students receiving loans from the *Zhong Xin* (中新) two newspapers' loan programs; (5) The direct family members of the above four categories; (6) All of the above are limited to those with poor families and diligent work.</p>
<p>At that time, we will invite Dr. Fu Qing, Dr. Zhou Cheng Hu, Dr. Yu San, Dr. Yu Xin En, and Dr. Gu Yu Qi to preside over the matter, and consult with the following major hospitals to share the work:</p>
<p>1.  Red Cross Society First Hospital 2. Red Cross Society Third Hospital 3. Guangci Hospital 4. Hongren Hospital 5. Tongren Second Hospital 6. Shanghai Hospital 7. Shanghai Local Hospital 8. Shanghai Children's Hospital 9. Siming Hospital 10. Jimin Hospital 11. Shanghai Factory United Hospital, Nanshi Relief Hospital 13. New Pharmaceutical Industry Association First Hospital 14. New Pharmaceutical Industry Association Second Hospital 15. Shanghai Hygiene Experimental Zone 16. Xinzha Hygiene Experimental Zone</p>
<p>We know very well that the relief work needed in today's society is countless, and there are many urgent problems that have not been solved—we ourselves have many problems that need society to help us solve. This three-million-yuan medicine assistance campaign is truly a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the fundamental problem. What we hope is that everyone will come forward to find solutions where there seems to be no solution, and do their utmost with compassion. If small units like ours can collectively come together to form a large unit, then we will have more power and may be able to fulfill our wishes. We hope that our humble efforts will be appreciated.</p>
<p>(Note) The "Medicine Assistance Campaign" initiated by New Star Pharmaceutical Factory is indeed very much needed at this time. People who are generally poor and sick often suffer on their sickbeds due to their inability to afford medicine. The target beneficiaries specified above are all honest and upright in terms of their status, but their family circumstances are very difficult. If they unfortunately suffer from illness, wasting time and losing their jobs, it is not just a loss for themselves and their families. The launch of this campaign by New Star Pharmaceutical Factory can be said to be a righteous act that benefits society and the nation. We sincerely hope that major pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai can also follow suit and expand the organization, forming a unified institution, so that their contributions will be even greater. (Those who meet the above qualifications and need medicine assistance, please contact the above-mentioned hospitals for treatment).</p>

<p>A Mr. Li, to commemorate his deceased father, donated a large *zhongtang* (中堂) painting of "A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" to this office. The original letter is as follows: "Respected Sir/Madam, my late father was fond of giving and served as the chairman of various charitable organizations in his hometown for many years, engaging in relief work. Although I have the intention to inherit his legacy, I lack the ability and feel deeply ashamed. Seeing the increasing number of poor people suffering from cold and hunger in Shanghai today, and the growing number of young people dropping out of school, I cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, I donate a large *zhongtang* painting of "A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" inherited from my ancestors, painted by Yang Can (a person from the Jiaqing era). I pray that you will evaluate it and sell it at auction, with all proceeds going to your various charitable causes. I believe that there are many wealthy and generous people in Shanghai who will be willing to donate generously to benefit the poor. Then this painting can belong to a virtuous gentleman, and I can fulfill my wish to commemorate my late father's legacy. How fortunate that would be!" (Note: This painting is on display at this office, and you are welcome to visit and bid.)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage cares for over three hundred orphans, with monthly expenses of nearly two million yuan. Due to financial difficulties, a fourth fundraising meeting was held at the YMCA on Ningxia Road on the sixth of this month, with a goal of one and a half million yuan. Over a hundred directors and guests attended the orphanage, making it an unprecedented event that broke all previous fundraising records for the orphanage. Wen Lanting and Lin Kanghou, two prominent figures in society, served as honorary captain and captain, respectively. Mr. Wen said in his speech, "At this time, prices are rising and life is becoming more difficult, so there are more and more orphans. If we do not provide timely relief, the future of society will be greatly affected. Therefore, we hope everyone will work hard, as this is our duty." Mr. Lin then said, "The Fuyou Orphanage is at the forefront of relief work in Shanghai. I often visit the orphanage and eat with the children, and I find these innocent children to be very lovable. We are getting older, and the future of the country depends entirely on the children. Therefore, we must cultivate the children, and we must provide relief to children who have lost their support. We all have children, and we must take care of helpless children equally, as this is our inescapable responsibility." He also said, "Mr. Wen and I will each donate one hundred thousand yuan to do our part. There are many people here who are ten or a hundred times more capable than we are, so we hope they will donate generously." The directors and guests present were moved by the speeches of the two elders. Guan Chao and Jiang Ziyun each pledged one million yuan on the spot. Zheng Jianyuan and Yu Guanming each pledged five hundred thousand yuan, Xia Shikui pledged three hundred thousand yuan, and Wu Ruqing, He Zhaosong, Xia Caigui, Cheng Xiangzhi, and Shen Yongkang each pledged two hundred thousand yuan. The中华一元學會, Xu Lianfang, Ge Leisheng, Yu Zhitian, Zhuang Bingchun, Zhan Fuxi, Wang Nianzu, Li Jianxian, Wang Kun, Zhang Gengshen, Shi Huiren, Jia Yanqi, Ning Sihong, Zhu Kuangming, Li Zixia, Cai Runsen, Pu Wenbin, Zhou Yuesheng, Xu Jing, Hu Xiangyao, Yang Jingcheng, and Wang Huaiquan each pledged one hundred thousand yuan. We hope that all sectors will respond enthusiastically so that the orphanage's relief work will not be interrupted. If you would like to donate, in addition to sending donations to the association at No. 432, Cishou Building, Nanzhi Road, this office can also collect donations on your behalf.</p>

<p>Times of turmoil are truly a misfortune for scholars. Even Du Fu, the Poet Sage, could not avoid the starvation of his beloved son! The economic chaos of the past month has pushed the livelihood of scholars in Shanghai to the brink of despair, which is deeply regrettable. Culture is the lifeblood of a nation, and the scholars of an era are the ones who maintain the culture of that era. I hope that enthusiastic people in society with status and wealth, will feel the pain in their hearts and sponsor various translation and compilation projects to provide work for those who make a living with pen and ink, so that they can avoid the misery of cold and hunger. Saving scholars is to prolong the lifeblood of a culture, which is more effective than passive relief. (Tang Jinggao)</p>
