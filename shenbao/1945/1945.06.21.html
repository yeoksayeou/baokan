<h3>沖繩島南部繼續血戰　日軍實施總突擊　宮古島附近發現機動部隊</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電冲繩本島南部島尻地區敵軍，十六·十七日以來，逐次侵入東半部之戰綫，但日軍於十七日加以猛烈反攻，繼續奪　八重灝岳方面之獨立高地等奮戰，戰綫一時巳見安定，然敵於十八日晨以來，於熾烈之砲轟擊掩護，尤於東部入重瀨岳正萬展開狀絕之激戰，日軍目下堅强確保由具仲座南方八重瀨岳南麓起至西海岸綫，刻該方面之戰况雙方紛亂，陷於混亂狀態，似在繼續凄慘之死鬥血戰。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地二十日中央社常冲繩本島南部地區之敵，由東海岸綫壓迫八重瀨岳，逐次深入南側之日軍陣地，日軍展開白刃迎擊戰，使敵軍多數犧牲，刻　續勇戰中。小祿地區形成交錯混戰狀態，各處展開激戰，日海軍部隊於前日下午七時三十分實施總突擊，揮自刃突入敵陣，該方面之戰况，似巳達最後之階段。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地二十日中央社電　冲繩方面天氣，十九日依然惡劣，雙方之航空作戰，因是頗現運滯狀態，來襲列島綫之敵機僅九十餘架，又敵機動部隊十九日午後曾以空母五艘，戰艦一艘及戰艦三艘爲基幹，組成艦隊兩組，於宮古島附近出現。又本島附近亦有空母一艘，戰艦一艘及巡洋艦，　逐艦若干艘出現，此外慶良間列島一帶，亦有敵輸送船羣百餘艘停泊。</p>
<h3>美軍事記者論述太平洋作戰困難</h3>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據紐約來電，紐約時報軍事記者，對於太平洋戰區美軍之補給困難，加以論述，指摘如下：太平洋之戰爭，較歐洲戰爭更島困難，最大問題即長距　與補　是也。對日作戰根本首軍補給，自美國作戰以來，至歐戰告終止，美軍之傷亡及失踪者，業有百萬餘名，然征服日本損害將更多，而美開方面爲使損害減少於最低限度，則美國對日作戰勢必發動其龐大物量，如在歐洲戰塲僅需用一艘運輸船時，在太平洋作戰則必需三艘以上。芙國因感於太平洋戰區所用運輸船之不足，現已將勝利型貨船百艘改裝爲運輸船，舊式自由型貨船一百七十二艘，亦行改裝爲軍隊運輸船。按遣送武裝之步兵一師團，當需貨船六七艘與等數之軍隊運輸船，若運輸機械化師團時，則需要更多。美國之一機械化師團，擁有戰車二百六十九輛，自動砲八十鬥，載重汽車六百三十七輛，牽引車六百另一輛，小型汽車，裝甲軍，戰車修理車五百五十五輛，舟艇四百七十一艘，而維持一師團之戰車，年需補充一百五十萬頓零件，此種另件，必須以六百輛貨車運送至出港地。又為維持四百輛之舟艦活動，年需補充四十七萬四千噸另件，且由太平洋戰域往返於基地間，需十六星期，步兵一師團戰鬥一日，耗費彈藥五百噸，機械化一師團挺進百哩，需消費汽汕七萬五千加侖，雖太平洋方而尚未使用空中堡壘　　型機，然現發動。　型機千架即需彈藥千噸，炸彈一萬五千噸，汽汕三萬噸，滑機汕四萬噸及其他物資四萬四千噸。前此仁牙因　之登陸戰，出動參加艦船計一千另三十三艘，海軍人員二十七萬七千名。硫黃島登陸作戰，參加艦船計八百艘，海軍人員二十二萬餘名。由是而觀，太平洋作戰之困難，更當較此爲甚。</p>
<p>沖繩美軍死傷日增</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電因日陸·海·空一體之殊死猛攻，侵犯冲繩之敵傷亡慘重，美新聞記者洛倫斯曾抨擊稱，冲繩作戰損失，較珍珠港尤重，美國內與論對於美軍空前之損害引起大反擊。據守本島南部地區之日陸上部隊，殺傷，軍迄今業達七萬五千名。日軍特攻隊亦連日繼續猛烈進攻本島附近敵艦隊及敵飛機塲，內此敵損　傷亡逐日激增。敵軍幹部爲掩飾此次莫大犧牲，仍弄其以多報少之狡滑手段，然據十六日關島廣播稱，冲繩美軍之損害，意外慘重，依據五月二十四日公布數字，陣亡失踪總數約計三萬五千一百十六名，實爲硫黃島之二倍，其太部則屬海軍兵員，因迎日特攻隊活　，致死傷更重。</p>
<h3>厘巴板　繼續遭炮擊</h3>
<p>西南太平洋茲地二十日中央社電敵軍現尚對　厘巴板繼續加以艦砲射擊中。十九日有掃海艇四艘侵入灣內，開始掃海工作，日軍則據陸上堅陣，加以猛射，其後敵掃海艇中一艘忽中機省沉沒，其他三艘因恐日軍砲擊，乃向　外逃去。</p>
<h3>美掃海艦　一艘被擊沉</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據華盛頓訊，美海部頃公布，昔會充羅斯福總統海外旅行時保衛艦之掃海艦依門思號，四月六日於沖繩島海面為日本特攻機　沉，海員死六十一名，受傷七十八人。按依門思號本為　逐艦，後改造為掃海艦，至本年一月，方配置於太平洋海域。</p>
<h3>日樞府全體會　在宮中舉行</h3>
<p>表决戰時緊急措置法</p>
<p>京二十日中央社電樞密院於二十日上午九時三十分，在宮中舉行戰時緊急措置法案之審査委員會，審議御　詢案件，繼於天皇陛下躬臨下，於十一時起舉行全體會議，平沼，淸水正副議長及全體顧問均行出席，提出戰時緊急措置法案，照淸水委員長之報告表決，旋即開會。</p>
<h3>日財界整備　決戰態勢</h3>
<p>東京二十日央社電　當茲戰局積極河曰　之際，日三井·三菱·住友等巨大財閥，均急於整備澈底抗戰之決戰態勢，日本財界之此種傾尚，洵値重視。蓋三井財　率先示範，決定三井本家在戰爭中辭退所有股票之利息，復將具體機構改進稱為決戰態勢，其所屬下各公司，在日本國內共有一百七十三處之多，事業方面計有商業·金融·礦山·重化學。工業等各部門，値茲本土決戰下，事業之統轄煞費苦心，常設置地方總監府，將全國劃分爲關東·東海·近機·中國·四國·九州等行政地區後，乃今直轄公司之常務董事代表總公司，常駐於各地區，其下設置三井協力會議，以資輔佐，俾期强力統糖各地區之所轄公司。又三菱財閥方面，亦與三井採取一步驟，向主要地區派遺巾樞人物，急於整備決戰熊勢。又住友財閥方面，則於總公司設置戰時總力會議，並置統　各地區全力面事業之總監與輔佐機關之總本部長及副本部長，其活動業已開始，若當國土分斷時，彼等均有採取臨機應變之強力權限，是以此種措置可謂為財閥之一致決戰態勢，而巨大財閥竟能整備如斯措置者，深堪注目。</p>
<h3>浙東觀感　奉化概況</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>由　縣至奉化，如搭乘華中鐵進之長途汽車前往，全程共三十二公里。按　奉公路沿綫總計有大站六處，即石喫·　社·橫漲·江口·樓塘。大橋（奉化境）。本年四月二十六日前，票價僅兩千一百元，茲已漲至五千五百元，以票價昂貴，致往來兩地之旅客，類皆改乘汽船前往奉化西塢鎭，汽船票價僅七百元，惜西塢距奉化縣城，尚有念里之遙，故仍須改乘黃包車，而汽軍則可直達大橋站，此汽車之勝於汽船者。</p>
<p>沿途一瞥</p>
<p>記者於五月二十六日晨八時半，由寗波南門之　奉汽車站，搭乘客車前去奉化，沿途農民正忙於農事。經江口站車停片刻，「江口河」河面至廣，但水流　淺，小船往來其問，皆賴船夫涉水推進，頓爲勞苦。據同車之鄉人云：每年春汛時，山水從山間下　，其時水勢至大，可注滿江身。</p>
<p>中途有元貞橋，橋身至長，乃木建，係盟邦駐軍士兵所搭建者，茲仍有石碑留存橋畔，以表其功績，（按此橋爲　奉公路中之獨一無二之大橋，全長計約二十餘丈。）</p>
<p>十時半抵奉化大橋站，以站上無車，乃步往縣政府訪問。中途　錦屏山，有中山公園，園依山而築。記者順便登山一遊，山上有中正圖書館，燬於事變，目前僅存軀殼，廟宇則有上中下塔三寺，規模至宏。據謂此乃梁時常地大橋岳林寺名僧「布袋和尚」之葬身地。</p>
<p>靜岡福岡等市被投燒夷彈</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　馬里亞納基地　型機二百架，其中約九十架，於二十日零時四十分左右逐次侵入豐橋方面，對該地附近投下燒夷彈後，午前三時許向南方退去。又敵機二百一十架對靜岡市附近投下燒夷彈後遁去，因之靜岡及豐橋市各處發生火災，靜岡市火災至五時左右撲滅，豐橋市則至晨八時始撲滅。</p>
<p>大阪二十汨巾央社電　十九日十一時起至二十日午前二時除之問，敵　型機三十餘架，由紀伊水道南端向奈良，三重兩縣中部北進，侵入若狹灣，投下機雷後，經東海軍管區遺去。</p>
<p>福岡二十日中央社電　四部軍管司令部六月二十日時發表：　馬利亞納基地　型敵機約六十架，六月十九日下午十時三十分許起，至二十日零時三十分，自宮崎縣束方海面以單機及少數編隊，分批侵入九州本土，約歷二小時之久，對福岡市投擲　　彈。　又同時刻起，自豐後水道侵入之　　型敵機十架，於關門附近投下機實。　福岡市內各處發生火災，但經軍官民勢力灌救，迄二時三十分許大部已告熄滅。</p>
<p>福岡二十日中央社電午前入時二十分，冲繩基地敵　　·　　等小型機約三十架，經大草西方海面，侵入大村地區，加以攻擊，九時許由長崎附近遁去。</p>
<p>市容一般</p>
<p>泰北最大之街道，為大橋鎭之大橋直街橫街，長約兩里許，爲全縣繁華中心。次推縣前街，橋東街，中正公　等處，店鋪以雜貨店為多，其不同於他鄉者，如南貨店同時亦代售西葉，頗為別致。</p>
<p>交通概况</p>
<p>事變前奉化對外交通，頗爲發　，公路計有：</p>
<p>鄞奉公路幹綫，係由本縣境內魚山頭起，達縣城外，長九公里，次由華牛鐵道公司管理，每日由寗波與奉化間，上下午各開行客車一次。</p>
<p>奉公路支綫：江溪段，乃由江口起至溪口，全續長二十一公里。目前江口至溪口一段已修竣，行駛貨車銜接奉新路。</p>
<p>奉新公路：由奉化至新昌縣城，全程計二十六公里，平日駛行貨車往返於都縣新　間。</p>
<p>奉海公路：係奉化直達海寗縣者，經事變破壞後，因接近戰區，迄今仍未見修復。</p>
<p>目前除　奉公路照常開駛外，餘皆以環境關係，暫告停頓。</p>
<p>水路：奉化主要之河流爲縣溪，金溪，　溪，上流以河身於淺，僅通竹筏。下流則可行民船。三溪皆與奉化江相街接。按奉化江長二十六公里，可通小汽船與帆船，直達甬江，滙流入海。</p>
<p>官道：奉化之主要道爲「縣東道」，係由本縣之東門起直達西塢，長十公里，可通人力京及塌車，此外蕭王顯等地亦有官道可通車輛。</p>
<p>名產與物價</p>
<p>奉化所產之水蜜桃，馳名全國，其出產地乃以離縣城四十里之溪口，沙地，爲最著名。在事變前鄉人每於桃樹結果後，隨即罩以特製之紙套，加意保護，故成熟後，肥大異常，味美而甜，且無疤斑。茲以成本過重，人工昂貴，兼以環境不許，故任其自然，致都市中人今日不復能有此口福矣。又據鄕人云：該鄕之桃樹結果五年後，則不復甜美，現鄕人以生活困難，類多將桃樹鋸去，以作燃料。</p>
<p>記者到奉之日，常地米價每石十二三萬元，汕每斤八百八十元，菜每斤三百二十元，豬肉市秤每斤一千一百元，火柴每盒一百十元。</p>
<p>奉化目前以住勝缺乏，故外鄕人覓屋不易。且旅客前往，並無旅館可　住宿，最近普通房一問，以米論租，每月須米一斗左右。至鬧區之市房，約須兩斗至四斗左右云。</p>
<p>面積與人口</p>
<p>奉化縣西南地高多山，東北地勢較低，全縣面積東西最大距離爲八二公里，南北為四○公里，全縣共計一五○○方公里。</p>
<p>全縣除兩個直轄鎭（奉中鎭大橋鎭），計分五區，合計四十三鎭，而實際僅三十八鄕鎭，其他五鄕鎭爲非和平區。即此三十八鄕鎭言，內中十二鄕鎭爲安全區，十四鄕鎭爲半安全區，十二鄕鎭爲危險區。其戶口之統計爲三○二保，三三一○甲，四一八三六戶，人口總計一七○八五八人，內計男子八六七四一人，女子八四一一七人。</p>
<p>至於治安情形，全衛之日衛實力，三十八鄕鎭中，有自衛隊之組織者計十九鄉鎭，此外並有盟邦隊伍及國軍第十師，分駐各重要據點。</p>
<p>田畝概况</p>
<p>全縣之田畝（包括遊擊區）總數爲七十八萬八千零十八。九五畝，內計稻田三十三萬兩千四百四十九，八三畝，地（種雜糧者）六萬七千四百五十四·○二畝，山地三十七萬六千三百七十三·二八畝，蕩地一萬一千七百四十一·八二畝</p>
<p>農村之都莊，總計一百四十一莊，地主據　最多者，亦僅五六百畝。事變前佃農對業主之租榖，原爲上下兩期，共兩百斤，後以農村「派榖」關係，故曾減爲每畝全年租穀一百斤。但目前情形略異，大政「大田」「地腳」向業主每畝每年付租　一百六十七斤，「小田」種戶向「地脚」每畝全年（於險　七月中）付租穀約七八十斤，向業生分上下兩期，一次四十斤，總計租毅八十斤。</p>
<p>田賦與縣政開支</p>
<p>按三十二年時，奉化縣之賦率爲稻田每畝三十元，地每畝二十元，山地與蕩地則爲每畝四元，當時預定可收七百六十八萬餘元，除附有征收公費一成半外，其實征賦數僅爲四百四十一萬七千餘元。</p>
<p>其支配情形，爲省府提取四分之三，其餘四分之一則歸縣府。但當時以縣政府之經費艱窘，故是年共解往省府之　款僅十萬元。餘則事後呈准省府核准將餘款三百二十一萬三千三百六十元，准予統　該縣府支酊。</p>
<p>三十三年度賦率已更，計田爲六十元，地爲二十五元，山，蕩地爲六元，於九月開徵，迄年底總數計為一千○三十六萬四千餘元。其支配方法，則省四縣六，延收公費亦改二成，共應解之省款三百三十一萬六千餘元，目下已解一百八十九萬○七百二十九元。</p>
<p>當記者前往縣府訪問時，縣府之設備至為簡陋，傳達室之勤務，衣著　　，事後該縣政治　人員談及，該縣原為三等縣，後始升格為二等，但一切收入大宗，仰諸田賦，但年來縣政不能順利推進，故欠賦之晨田亦夥。據統計三十二年度欠賦之田，計兩萬○四百六十八畝，地一萬七千九百十三畝，山地十二萬八千三百八十三畝，墓地四百五十一畝。三十三年度田四萬一千七百六十八畝，地兩萬一千二百四十三畝，山地十五萬三千○七十四畝，萬地六百九十三畝。綜觀其欠賦之讓畝數額，逐漸增加，故其本身經費至感困難。而省府所　之經費，如以三十三年度時六月至十二月份爲例，則使七萬二千元，而實際開支每月二十餘萬元，現難增加經費，但仍感收支不足相抵。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>取締貼現浪潮</h3>
<p>在經濟理論上講，「現鈔缺乏」，就是所謂「通貨緊縮」。通貨緊縮的好處，就在使一般持資者手頭缺乏過剩購買力，無法利用此過剩購買力以從事物資囤積，因此，自然可以成爲平抑物價的方法之一。但　。現在市面上的「現鈔缺乏」，和經濟現論上的「通貨緊縮」，卻迥然不同。</p>
<p>今日市面「現鈔缺乏」的原因，旣非當局實行通貨緊縮政策的結果，我們就應該另行研究造成所謂「鈔荒」的原因。事實非常明顯，這種「鈔荒」之發生，是不自然不合理的現象。回顧最近半年乃至一年間金融市況，當發行五百元券及一千券前後，亦曾發生「鈔荒」現象，其間人爲的原因，也是很明顯的，當時一部分狡黠的金融業者，已有重機提高貼現事以牟私立的舉動，不過後來金融當局　　得宜，未曾釀成嚴重後果。近來若干金融業者，正常的業務因種種原因未克　展，因此多數從非法牟利方面活動。這次現鈔恐慌，主要的原因，就是一部份金融業者，故意　　現鈔，濫發撥款單及本票；另一方面，部化整爲零，在街頭出現許多貼現業者，以謀額外利益，於是貼現率由數分電狂增至二角以上。</p>
<p>這種人爲的「鈔荒」，現在至少已縱造成兩人非常惡劣的結果：第一，就是對一般平民也就是最大多數人民生活上的嚴重咸脅。他們收入的數額，一方面受到物價瘋狂上漲的影響，已經打了一個很大的折扣，譬如在上月份，一個普通薪水階級收入的數額約為十萬元，可以購一石米；現在卻買不到二斗了，無　打了一個折扣，變成二萬元了。現在似定這十萬元又是支票，兌得的又是撥款單或本槳，不得不再以百分之十五至二十五的貼現率去兌現，則實際說得，就不及上月的一成了！除了物價間　當另謀對策之外，對於「鈔荒」所引起的對於大多數人民的意外剝削，實應迅謀適當的對策。第二個惡劣的結果，就是一部份金融業者爲着製造「鈔荒」，大家扣住現鈔而濫發撥款單及本票，漸至造成信用通貨惡性膨脹的現象，這就是說在國家力謀限制通貨發行以免刺激物價的今日，各行莊竟變成變相的通貨增發機關，以刺激物價。如果說，限制現鈔流通數量，是當局防制物價高漲的「通貨緊縮」手段，那麽，現在事實證明，道種辦法，只是剝　了廣大人民的小額購買力，而放縱了少數　　者利用撥款單等信用通貨以操縱市塲，他們絕不受到限制現鈔流通的影響，相反的，現鈔流通的限制，却使他們以無限制發行及利用撥款單等信用通貨的方式，可以照樣從事囤積和投機，而其風險却須由國家及中儲負責，這是何等不合理和危險的現象！何況市上已迭次發現偽造的　款單等！</p>
<p>由於上述種植危險現象，我們　請當局即須採取以下急救「鈔荒」的辦法：</p>
<p>第一，中能對各行莊合理的供應現鈔。中儲行發行局對滬行之現鈔供應·今後首先應合理調整。聞目前每日供應固定數量現鈔，賣際上無法合理支配於各行莊，應以每一星期或半月之總數，全部供給，俾可統盤薄劃，然後，再就市塲實際情形而對各行莊作合理的分配。</p>
<p>第二，對各行莊發行信用通貨，本有日本拼　正金，銀聯準備庫，及錢聯等三系統，除正金一系統不論外，我方銀聯及錢聯，關於撥款單及本票之發行，本有相當嚴格之等級規定。但實際各行莊發行及交換之數額，不免又非法濫行事實，如過大額面及零細額面之濫發，流弊極大，今後對於准發　款單之行莊，應嚴格規定資格，不合格者，不准發行　款單，並對已發者，責令從速收回，以防流弊。各行莊對於存戶提現，不得濫加限制或改付　款單等，以保障一般人民生活。</p>
<p>此外，關於取締高額貼現率，自屬重要措置，但如能實施上述二項辦法，則雖不取締，而高利貼現剝削之風，自將漸趨平息。</p>

<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據新德里電，印緬方面之美軍司令官陛爾丹中將，此次返華盛頓，業由東南亞細亞聯合軍副司令官霍拉兼任。按薩爾丹於一九四三年曾任斯蒂組爾之副司令官而到印度，其後將從事於指揮緬甸作戰。</p>
<h3>渝定期召集　四屆參戰會</h3>
<p>中共不派員出席</p>
<p>廣州二十日中央社電據重慶電，渝國民參政會第四屆第一次大會，定七月七日召集。</p>
<p>中央社訊據延安訊，渝方定七月七日在重　召開國民參政會，中共已發表不派本黨參政會員出席，此暴露最近國共磨擦日益激烈。中共方面之理由，據中共中央委員會負責人稱：　去年九月以來，中共民主主　聯盟及一般民主主義之大衆，曾向國民黨要求廢止一黨專制，召開各政黨代表會議，建立臨時聯合政府及戰後實施一般選舉，幷召集國民大會，但遭國民黨拒絕。　關於七月七日召開第四屆國民參政會，國民黨事前幷未向中共及其他政黨徽詢意見。　國民參政會及參政會員，均認爲國民黨是獨裁的組織。　國民大會完全爲國民黨獨佔，有造成民衆分裂，爆發內亂之處。　將來開國民參政會時，將被迫通過國民黨各項反動的具體措置，如獲通過，則犯重大過失，據傳國民黨六全大曾僅決定十一月十二時召集國民大會，關於國民大曾之職權及大會代表問題幷未提及，擬在七月七日開國民參政會徵詢黨外意見後，再行正式決定手，段固極狡猾。同時，延安之七全大會，毛澤東政治報告中，反對由國民黨召集國民大會，否認該大會之正當性，，幷率直抨擊此爲重慶激起內戰之企圖，重慶原謀利用國民參政會掩人耳目，但又遭中共反對，中共之不派代表出席，更表示中共已與國民大會絕　，而國共關係亦因國民大會問題更趨惡化。</p>
<p>華南日軍精銳陷　省三南定南現正展開爭奪戰</p>
<p>廣州二十日中央社電日華南軍精銳，於六月初旬突向渝第七戰區開始進攻，不久即攻陷江四省三南（龍南·虔南·南）渝方第七戰區軍之反攻據點，十六日之渝方廣播，亦認承該項事實如次：廣東·江西兩省之渝軍，自獲得援軍後，十六日晨於日軍所攻陷之定南展開爭奪激戰，該地西方地區亦演成激戰，又於龍體　附近，頃正攻擊攻陷該地東北方安遠之日軍。</p>
<p>廣東二十日中央社電　日軍此次於三南地區展開作戰後，會自南北兩方，以數縱隊兵力直接包　渝軍，出其不意，一舉而將渝軍根據地完全覆滅，完成大殲滅戰。蓋日軍於六月一日，由廣東地區出動二縱隊，由惠州方面出動一縱隊，開始北上，並由粵漢綫上之要衝韶關及前駐渝美空軍航空基地之南雄組成一縱隊，由三方同時開始進攻，十五·十六兩日，到達三南地區，對渝第七戰區軍主力之第十二集團軍第六十三，六十五兩軍約六萬名，展開挾擊戰，現正擴大戰果中。渝軍亦因日軍突加攻擊，倉像失措，未得運輸各種集結之物資軍需，以致全部爲日軍鹵獲，渝第七戰區軍力，因日罩此次進攻，業已全告潰滅。渝軍前雖盛傳反攻準備已告完成，然實際亦不外空呼口號，吾人由此次渝方將領余漢謀等未交一戰，即行潰退，事實上亦可知渝方戰意早已喪失無遺。</p>
<p>廣州二十日中央社電　日華南精銳攻陷三南地區，覆滅敵反攻基地後，刻正急追置退之殘敵，並從事攻陷地憲內掃蕩工作，準備次期作戰。此次作戰中，敵軍狼狠不堪，敵將蔣武竟不戰而退，兵器，子彈，糧食等軍需物資被拋緊滿地。自此次作戰開始迄十七日止，日軍戰果已查明者，計掩埋敵屍八〇五眞，俘虜五八○人，截獲高射砲八門，各種火砲五十四門，重輕機槍七○挺，彈藥汽車等甚夥。</p>

<p>消防處塚崎處長，服務滬市巳歷三十餘年，經騐宏富，當此決戰日趨緊張階段，敵機空襲，爆炸火災，均在意料之中·因此，消防工作極爲重要。聞塚崎處長　其經騐，擬有整個加强消防之計劃，亟盼從速實施，以期減少災害，市民方面，我們將竭力喚起注意，協力推進。</p>

<h3>二期平價雜糧　昨起繼續舉辦　價格較第一期平均低落</h3>
<p>國府當局鑒於京滬米價突飛猛漲，影響整個社會經濟治安及民生至鉅，遂於日前採取緊急措置，商由有關方面全面協助，明令米統會及其他團體一致停止收買工作，一面將移動限制逕予取消。此次斷然措置實施後，立使各地米糧價格，逐漸降落，尚有繼續下趨之勢。上海區雜糧業同業公會，爲呼應政府之施策起見，自動將赤豆·菉豆·　豆·苞米等入種雜糧價格併行照市　減，自本月十七日起以第一期試辦性質，通飭批發商及零售商會員一體遵照平價出售，不得有拒絕等情形。現第二期出售平　雜糧，已於昨（二十）日起機續舉辦，所有第二期各種價格，較第一期平均低落，每市担各一萬元左右。聞本市雜糧存底頗豐，而日方亦將放出，至普遍配給辦法，亦正聯絡各方迅速推進中，以期尅日舉辦，補助米源之不足。</p>

<h3>老閘警分局　取締攤販</h3>
<p>老閘警察分局，爲維護交通安全，對沿路攤販，定予取締，同時査區內各里弄口，均攤販林立，非但對里街口之交通有所阻碍，而一旦發生不測事件，更爲危險。並爲整刷市容，已由該分局長令　取締除領有執照之固定攤基外，其餘臨時攤販一律取締，如違拘局罰辦。</p>
<h3>違限繳納房捐　處罰辦法</h3>
<p>本市財政局鑒於向來市民繳納房捐，常有違限情事，爲整頓稅政起見，經訂定征收房捐暫行章程，呈請市政核准，規定各住戶於接到房捐通知書後，應於十日內如數繳納，違限不繳者，按其應納捐額加收滯納罰金百分之十。逾限十日以上者，按其應納捐額加收滯納罰金百分之二十。逾限二十日以上者，按其應納捐額加收滯納罰金百分之三十。逾限一個月以上者除派　追機外，幷按其應納捐額加收滯納罰金百分之五十。希各戶主意免政處罰。</p>
<h3>南市戶口皂　後日起配售</h3>
<p>商統會日用品統制委員會，茲定於六月二十三日起至二十七日止，由市區內各肥皂零　處，憑第四十三號綜合配給證，開始酊售黃祥茂戶口肥皂一塊。價格定爲國幣五百元正，包括零售捐在內。該區內市民得憑該號酊給證，向與證上號碼相同之肥皂零賣處購領。</p>
<h3>滬市物價高翔影響物資交流</h3>
<p>近來物資移動搬出入情形，於統制許可制度下仍極暢利，華中地區物資移動數量，較上月雖漸減少，但輸送工具，顯此以前圓滑。華北·華南·淮海·武漢等地區移入物資，情形則仍屬正常。據悉，上海地區因物價馳漲之影響與華中各地物資價格已告平衡，故批發販賣商同業，均以無利可營，輸出數量已隨之步減，但此種物價平衡，對於戰時物資交流不無發生不良反應，上海物價如不加抑低，則民需物資之供應，亦失其交流之原旨。</p>
<h3>經濟警察拘獲　非法貼現案犯　將依擾亂金融罪嚴辦</h3>

        <h1>1945.06.21</h1>
<h3>Bloody Battles Continue in Southern Okinawa; Japanese Forces Launch General Assault; Mobile Force Discovered Near Miyako Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Since the 16th and 17th, enemy forces in the southern Shimajiri district of Okinawa Island have gradually encroached upon the eastern half of the battle line. However, on the 17th, Japanese forces launched a fierce counterattack and continued fighting to recapture independent high ground in the Yaeju-Dake area. The battle line had momentarily stabilized. However, since the morning of the 18th, under the cover of intense artillery bombardment, especially in the east at Mount Yaeju, an incredibly fierce battle unfolded. At present, Japanese forces are steadfastly securing the line from the southern foot of Mount Yaeju, south of Gushichanza, to the west coast. The situation on that front is chaotic, with both sides locked in a confusing and seemingly continuous, tragic, bloody battle.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 20th (Central News Agency) – The enemy in the southern Okinawa Island area is pressing upon Mount Yaeju from the east coast, gradually penetrating the southern Japanese lines. Japanese forces are engaging in bayonet charges, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and continuing to fight bravely. In the Oroku area, a confused, intertwined battle has developed, with fierce fighting erupting everywhere. The Japanese naval forces launched a general assault at 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, committing suicide charges into enemy lines. The situation on that front appears to have reached its final stages.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 20th (Central News Agency) – The weather in the Okinawa area on the 19th remained poor, significantly hindering air operations on both sides. Only about 90 enemy planes attacked the island chain. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 19th, an enemy mobile force consisting of two fleets, with five aircraft carriers, one battleship, and three cruisers as their core, appeared near Miyako Island. Also, near the main island, one aircraft carrier, one battleship, and several cruisers and destroyers appeared. In addition, over a hundred enemy transport ships were anchored in the Kerama Islands area.</p>
<h3>American Military Correspondent Discusses Difficulties of Pacific Warfare</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New York, a military correspondent for the New York Times discussed the supply difficulties faced by the American forces in the Pacific Theater, pointing out the following: The war in the Pacific is even more difficult than the war in Europe. The biggest problems are long distances and supply. Supplying the war against Japan from the very beginning of American involvement until the end of the European war resulted in over a million American casualties and missing personnel. But conquering Japan will result in even greater losses. To minimize losses, the United States must deploy vast quantities of supplies in the war against Japan. Where only one transport ship was needed in the European theater, three or more are needed in the Pacific. Feeling the shortage of transport ships in the Pacific Theater, the United States is now converting one hundred Victory-class freighters into troop transports, and one hundred and seventy-two older Liberty-class freighters are also being converted into troop transports. Sending an armed infantry division requires six or seven freighters and an equal number of troop transports. Transporting a mechanized division requires even more. An American mechanized division has 269 tanks, 80 self-propelled guns, 637 heavy trucks, 601 tractors, small cars, armored vehicles, and 555 tank repair vehicles, and 471 boats. Maintaining the tanks of one division requires replenishing 1.5 million tons of spare parts annually, which must be transported to the port of departure in 600 trucks. Furthermore, maintaining the activity of 400 warships requires replenishing 474,000 tons of spare parts annually. A round trip between the Pacific Theater and the base takes sixteen weeks. An infantry division fighting for one day consumes 500 tons of ammunition. A mechanized division advancing 100 miles consumes 75,000 gallons of gasoline. Although B-29-type planes have not yet been used extensively in the Pacific, when 1,000 B-29 planes are launched, they require 1,000 tons of ammunition, 15,000 tons of bombs, 30,000 tons of gasoline, 40,000 tons of lubricants, and 44,000 tons of other supplies. For the landing operation at Lingayen Gulf, a total of 1,033 ships were deployed, with 277,000 naval personnel. For the landing operation on Iwo Jima, a total of 800 ships were deployed, with over 220,000 naval personnel. From this perspective, the difficulties of Pacific warfare are even greater than these figures suggest.</p>
<p>American Casualties on Okinawa Increasing Daily</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Due to the desperate and fierce attacks by Japanese land, sea, and air forces, the enemy invading Okinawa has suffered heavy casualties. American journalist Lawrence criticized, saying that the losses in the Okinawa operation were heavier than those at Pearl Harbor, causing a major backlash in American domestic opinion regarding the unprecedented damage to American forces. The Japanese ground forces defending the southern part of the island have killed or wounded 75,000 enemy soldiers to date. Japanese special attack units are also continuing to launch fierce attacks daily on enemy fleets and airfields near the main island, causing enemy losses and casualties to increase sharply every day. To conceal these enormous sacrifices, enemy officers continue to use cunning tactics to report fewer losses than actually occurred. However, according to a Guam broadcast on the 16th, the damage to American forces on Okinawa was unexpectedly severe. According to figures released on May 24th, the total number of dead and missing is estimated at 35,116, twice that of Iwo Jima, with the majority being naval personnel. Due to the Japanese special attack unit's activity, deaths and injuries are even more severe.</p>
<h3>Balikpapan Continues Under Shelling</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific, 20th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces are still subjecting Balikpapan to naval bombardment. On the 19th, four minesweepers entered the bay and began minesweeping operations. Japanese forces responded with heavy fire from fortified positions on land. Subsequently, one of the enemy minesweepers suddenly struck a mine and sank. The other three, fearing Japanese artillery fire, fled seaward.</p>
<h3>American Minesweeper Sunk</h3>
<p>Central News Agency – According to a Washington dispatch, the US Navy recently announced that the minesweeper Impeccable, which once served as a guard ship during President Roosevelt's overseas travels, was sunk by a Japanese special attack plane on April 6 in the waters off Okinawa Island, resulting in the deaths of 61 crew members and injuries to 78. The Impeccable was originally a destroyer but was later converted into a minesweeper. It was assigned to the Pacific region in January of this year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Privy Council Plenary Session Held at the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>Vote on Wartime Emergency Measures Law</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – At 9:30 AM on the 20th, the Privy Council held a review committee for the Wartime Emergency Measures Bill at the Imperial Palace to deliberate on matters submitted for imperial inquiry. Subsequently, with His Majesty the Emperor in attendance, a plenary session was held from 11:00 AM, with Chairman and Vice-Chairman Hiranuma and Shimizu, as well as all advisors, in attendance. The Wartime Emergency Measures Bill was presented, reported by Chairman Shimizu, and put to a vote, which was immediately passed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Business World Prepares for Decisive Battle Posture</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – As the war situation intensifies daily, the major Japanese zaibatsu, such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, are all urgently preparing for a thoroughgoing decisive battle posture of resistance. This inclination of the Japanese business world deserves serious attention. The Mitsui zaibatsu has taken the lead, deciding that the Mitsui main family will forego all stock interest during the war and has improved its concrete organization into a decisive battle posture. Its affiliated companies number 173 in Japan, with businesses spanning commerce, finance, mining, heavy chemical industry, and various industrial sectors. In the face of the decisive battle on the home islands, the coordination of these businesses requires painstaking effort. Local Supervisory Offices have been established, dividing the country into administrative regions: Kanto, Tokai, Kin-ki, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Then, the managing directors of directly controlled companies, representing the head office, are stationed in each region. Under them, a Mitsui Cooperation Council is established to assist, aiming to powerfully manage the companies under their jurisdiction in each region. The Mitsubishi zaibatsu is also taking steps similar to Mitsui, dispatching key figures to major regions, urgently preparing for a decisive battle posture. The Sumitomo zaibatsu has established a Wartime General Mobilization Council in its head office and has established a General Supervisor and assisting organizations, such as a General Headquarters and Deputy General Headquarters, to control all business operations in various regions. Their activities have already begun. If the country is divided, they all have powerful authority to take appropriate actions. Therefore, such measures can be described as a unified decisive battle posture of the zaibatsu, and it is worthy of note that the giant zaibatsu are able to prepare such measures.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang – Overview of Fenghua</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>To get from Ningbo County to Fenghua, one can take a long-distance bus operated by the Hua Zhong Railway, a journey of 32 kilometers. There are six main stops along the Ning-Feng Highway: Shique, Yinshe, Hengzhang, Jiangkou, Loutang, and Daqiao (within Fenghua). Before April 26th of this year, the fare was only 2,100 yuan, but it has now risen to 5,500 yuan. Due to the high fare, most travelers between the two places have switched to taking steamers to Xiwu Town in Fenghua. The steamer fare is only 700 yuan, but Xiwu is still 10 li (5 km) from Fenghua County, so one still needs to take a rickshaw. On the other hand, the bus can go directly to Daqiao Station, which is the advantage of the bus over the steamer.</p>
<p>A Glimpse Along the Way</p>
<p>On the morning of May 26th, at 8:30 AM, the reporter took a bus from the Ningbo South Gate Ning-Feng Bus Station to Fenghua. Along the way, farmers were busy with agricultural work. The bus stopped briefly at Jiangkou Station. The Jiangkou River is wide, but the water flow is shallow. Small boats travel back and forth, relying on boatmen to wade and push them, making it very laborious. According to a local on the bus, every spring, mountain water flows down from the mountains, and the water level rises significantly, filling the entire river.</p>
<p>Midway, there is Yuanzhen Bridge, a very long wooden bridge built by Allied soldiers. There is still a stone tablet next to the bridge to commemorate their achievement. (This bridge is the only major bridge on the Ning-Feng Highway, with a total length of over 20 zhang (approximately 66 meters).</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, we arrived at Daqiao Station in Fenghua. Since there were no cars available at the station, we walked to the county government for an interview. Along the way, we passed Jinping Mountain, which has a Zhongshan Park built on the mountain. The reporter took the opportunity to climb the mountain. On the mountain is the Zhongzheng Library, which was destroyed during the war and now only the shell remains. There are three temples: Upper, Middle, and Lower Pagoda Temples, all very grand. It is said that this is the burial place of the famous monk "Cloth Bag Monk" of Dajiao Yuelin Temple during the Liang Dynasty.</p>
<p>Shizuoka, Fukuoka, and Other Cities Hit by Incendiary Bombs</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Around 200 B-29 type aircraft from the Mariana Islands base, about 90 of which entered the Toyohashi area gradually around 0:40 AM on the 20th, dropped incendiary bombs on the vicinity, and retreated south around 3:00 AM. Another 210 enemy aircraft dropped incendiary bombs on the vicinity of Shizuoka City and fled, causing fires in various parts of Shizuoka and Toyohashi Cities. The fire in Shizuoka City was extinguished around 5:00 AM, while the fire in Toyohashi City was not extinguished until 8:00 AM.</p>
<p>Osaka, 20th (Central News Agency) – From 11:00 PM on the 19th to 2:00 AM on the 20th, over 30 enemy B-29-type aircraft advanced northward from the southern end of the Kii Channel towards the central parts of Nara and Mie Prefectures, entered Wakasa Bay, dropped naval mines, and disappeared via the Tokai Military District.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 20th (Central News Agency) – The 4th Military District Headquarters announced at 6:20 PM on June 20th that approximately 60 B-29 enemy aircraft from the Mariana Islands base had, from around 10:30 PM on June 19th to 0:30 AM on June 20th, entered Kyushu proper from the eastern sea of Miyazaki Prefecture in single aircraft and small formations, dropping bombs on Fukuoka City for approximately two hours. At the same time, 10 B-29 enemy aircraft, entering from the Bungo Channel, dropped naval mines near the Kanmon Straits. Fires broke out in various parts of Fukuoka City, but were largely extinguished by 2:30 AM through the efforts of military personnel and civilians.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 20th (Central News Agency) – At 8:20 AM, approximately 30 enemy F4U and F6F small aircraft from the Okinawa base entered the Omura area via the sea west of Ogasa and attacked, and disappeared near Nagasaki around 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>General City Appearance</p>
<p>The largest street in Fenghua is the Daqiao Straight Street and Heng Street in Daqiao Town, which are about two li (1 km) long and are the center of prosperity for the entire county. Next are County Front Street, Bridge East Street, Zhongzheng Road, etc. There are mostly general merchandise stores. Different from other places, the southern goods stores also sell western tobacco, which is quite unique.</p>
<p>Transportation Overview</p>
<p>Before the war, transportation in Fenghua was quite developed, with the following highways:</p>
<p>Ning-Fenghua Highway Trunk Line: From Yushantou within the county to outside the county seat, it is 9 kilometers long and is managed by the China Railway Company. There is one bus that runs between Ningbo and Fenghua in the morning and one in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Ning-Fenghua Highway Branch Line: Jiangkou Section, from Jiangkou to Xikou, is 21 kilometers long. Currently, the section from Jiangkou to Xikou has been completed, and trucks run to connect with the Fenghua-Xinchang Highway.</p>
<p>Fenghua-Xinchang Highway: From Fenghua to Xinchang County, the entire route is 26 kilometers. Trucks travel between the two counties on weekdays.</p>
<p>Fenghua-Haining Highway: This highway runs directly from Fenghua to Haining County. After being destroyed during the war, it has not been repaired to this day because it is close to the war zone.</p>
<p>Currently, except for the Ning-Fenghua Highway, which is still running as usual, all others have been temporarily suspended due to environmental factors.</p>
<p>Waterways: The main rivers in Fenghua are the County River, Jin River, and Mao River. The upper reaches are too shallow for anything but bamboo rafts. The lower reaches are navigable by civilian boats. All three rivers connect to the Fenghua River. The Fenghua River is 26 kilometers long and can accommodate small steamers and sailboats, leading directly to the Yong River and flowing into the sea.</p>
<p>Official Roads: The main road in Fenghua is the "County East Road," which runs from the east gate of the county directly to Xiwu, is 10 kilometers long, and is passable by rickshaws and carts. In addition, there are official roads to Xiaowangmiao and other places that are accessible to vehicles.</p>
<p>Specialties and Prices</p>
<p>The Fenghua water peaches are famous throughout the country, and the most famous production areas are Xikou and Shadi, which are 40 li (20 km) from the county seat. Before the war, locals would put specially made paper covers on the peach trees after they had fruited to protect them carefully. Therefore, after ripening, they were unusually large, delicious, and sweet, and had no blemishes. Nowadays, due to excessive costs, high labor costs, and an unfavorable environment, the peaches are left to grow naturally, so people in the cities can no longer enjoy this delicacy. According to the locals, the peach trees in the village stop producing sweet fruit five years after they begin to bear fruit. Now, due to difficult living conditions, many locals saw down the peach trees for fuel.</p>
<p>On the day the reporter arrived in Fenghua, the price of rice was 120,000 to 130,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg), oil was 880 yuan per jin (approximately 0.5 kg), vegetables were 320 yuan per jin, pork was 1,100 yuan per city jin, and matches were 110 yuan per box.</p>
<p>Currently, Fenghua is severely lacking in housing, so it is difficult for people from other places to find a house. Furthermore, there are no inns or hotels for travelers to stay in. Recently, the rent for a simple room is about one dou (approximately 10 kg) of rice per month. City housing in the busy areas costs about two to four dou of rice per month.</p>
<p>Area and Population</p>
<p>The southwest of Fenghua County is high and mountainous, while the northeast is relatively low. The maximum east-west distance of the entire county is 82 kilometers, and the north-south distance is 40 kilometers. The total area of the county is 1,500 square kilometers.</p>
<p>The entire county, excluding two direct-administered towns (Fengzhong Town and Daqiao Town), is divided into five districts, totaling 43 towns. In reality, there are only 38 townships, with the other five being non-peaceful areas. Of these 38 townships, 12 are safe areas, 14 are semi-safe areas, and 12 are dangerous areas. The population statistics are 302 bao (neighborhoods), 3,310 jia (groups of households), 41,836 households, and a total population of 170,858, including 86,741 males and 84,117 females.</p>
<p>As for the state of public order, of the 38 townships, 19 have self-defense force organizations. In addition, Allied forces and the 10th Division of the National Army are stationed in various important strongholds.</p>
<p>Land Overview</p>
<p>The total number of mu (approx. 667 m²) of land in the entire county (including guerrilla areas) is 788,018.95 mu, including 332,449.83 mu of paddy fields, 67,454.02 mu of dry land (used for planting miscellaneous grains), 376,373.28 mu of mountainous land, and 11,741.82 mu of marshland.</p>
<p>There are a total of 141 villages in the rural areas. The landlord with the most land owns only 500-600 mu. Before the war, tenant farmers paid two hundred jin (approx. 100 kg) of grain to the landowners for both seasons combined. Later, due to rural "grain requisitioning," this was reduced to one hundred jin of rent grain per mu per year. However, the current situation is slightly different. Those who plant "big fields" pay the landowner 167 jin of rent grain per mu per year, while those who plant "small fields" pay the "big field" landowner about 70-80 jin of rent grain per mu per year (in mid-July), and the landowner divides it into two seasons, 40 jin each time, for a total of 80 jin.</p>
<p>Land Tax and County Government Expenses</p>
<p>In 1943, the tax rate in Fenghua County was 30 yuan per mu for paddy fields, 20 yuan per mu for dry land, and 4 yuan per mu for mountainous and marshland. It was estimated that over 7.68 million yuan could be collected. After deducting a 15% levy collection fee, the actual tax revenue was only over 4.417 million yuan.</p>
<p>The distribution situation was that the provincial government took three-quarters, and the county government took the remaining one-quarter. However, at that time, the county government's finances were very tight, so only 100,000 yuan was sent to the provincial government that year. The remaining 3,213,360 yuan was later approved by the provincial government to be used for the county government's expenses.</p>
<p>The 1944 tax rate was increased to 60 yuan for paddy fields, 25 yuan for dry land, and 6 yuan for mountainous and marshland. Collection began in September, and the total amount collected by the end of the year was over 10.364 million yuan. The distribution method was 40% for the province and 60% for the county. The levy collection fee was also changed to 20%. The total amount to be remitted to the province was over 3.316 million yuan, and 1.890729 million yuan has already been remitted.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited the county government, the facilities were very simple, and the messenger in the communication room wore patched clothing. Afterwards, the political personnel of the county said that the county was originally a third-class county, but was later upgraded to a second-class county. However, most of the revenue comes from land tax, but in recent years, the county administration has not been able to advance smoothly, so there are many fields that are in arrears with taxes. According to statistics, in 1943, the fields in arrears with taxes totaled 20,468 mu, 17,913 mu of dry land, 128,383 mu of mountainous land, and 451 mu of cemetery land. In 1944, there were 41,768 mu of paddy fields, 21,243 mu of dry land, 153,074 mu of mountainous land, and 693 mu of marshland. Looking at the amount of land in arrears, it is gradually increasing, so the county's own expenses are very difficult. The funds allocated by the provincial government, taking July to December of 1944 as an example, totaled 72,000 yuan, while the actual monthly expenditure was over 200,000 yuan. Although it is now difficult to increase funding, it is still felt that income is insufficient to cover expenditure.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on the Discounting Craze</h3>
<p>In economic theory, "cash shortage" is what is known as "deflation." The benefit of deflation lies in preventing those who hold capital from having excess purchasing power, thereby making it impossible to use this excess purchasing power to engage in material hoarding. Therefore, it can naturally become one of the methods for stabilizing prices. However. The current "cash shortage" in the market is drastically different from the "deflation" in economic theory.</p>
<p>Since the reason for the current "cash shortage" in the market is not the result of the authorities implementing a deflation policy, we should conduct separate research into the causes of the so-called "cash crunch." The fact is very obvious that the occurrence of this "cash crunch" is an unnatural and unreasonable phenomenon. Looking back at the financial market conditions in the past six months to a year, a "cash crunch" phenomenon also occurred before and after the issuance of 500-yuan and 1000-yuan bills, during which artificial reasons were also very obvious. At that time, some cunning financial operators already had the intention of raising the discount rate to seek personal gain, but later the financial authorities handled it appropriately and did not cause serious consequences. Recently, the normal business of some financial operators has not been able to develop for various reasons, so most of them are engaged in illegal profit-making activities. The main reason for this cash panic is that some financial operators deliberately hoard cash and issue payment orders and promissory notes indiscriminately. On the other hand, it is broken down into smaller pieces, and many discounters appear on the streets to seek extra profits, so the discount rate has increased from several percentage points to more than 20%.</p>
<p>This artificial "cash crunch" has now caused at least two very bad consequences: first, it poses a serious threat to the lives of ordinary people, that is, the vast majority of people. The amount of their income, on the one hand, has been greatly discounted by the crazy rise in prices. For example, last month, the income of an ordinary salaried class was about 100,000 yuan, which could buy one shi of rice; now, it can't even buy two dou, and has been discounted to 20,000 yuan. Now it seems that these 100,000 yuan are all checks, and what is exchanged is a payment order or a promissory note, and then it has to be cashed at a discount rate of 15% to 25%, so the actual income is less than 10% of last month! In addition to devising other countermeasures for price increases, appropriate countermeasures should be devised quickly for the unexpected exploitation of the majority of people caused by the "cash crunch." The second bad consequence is that some financial operators, in order to create a "cash crunch," are holding back cash and issuing payment orders and promissory notes indiscriminately, gradually causing a malignant expansion of credit currency. That is to say, in today's situation where the country is striving to limit currency issuance to avoid stimulating prices, various banks and businesses have become disguised currency issuance agencies to stimulate prices. If limiting the amount of cash in circulation is the authorities' "deflation" measure to prevent price increases, then the current facts prove that this method only deprives the small purchasing power of the vast majority of people, while condoning a few manipulators to use credit currency such as payment orders to manipulate the market. They are not affected by the restriction of cash circulation. On the contrary, the restriction of cash circulation allows them to engage in hoarding and speculation in the same way by issuing and using credit currency such as payment orders without restrictions, and the risk is borne by the country and the Central Bank. This is such an unreasonable and dangerous phenomenon! What's more, counterfeit payment orders have been found in the market repeatedly!</p>
<p>Due to the above-mentioned dangerous phenomenon, we urge the authorities to immediately take the following emergency measures to deal with the "cash crunch":</p>
<p>First, the Central Bank should reasonably supply cash to various banks and businesses. The cash supply of the Central Bank's Issuing Bureau to Shanghai banks should be reasonably adjusted in the future. It is reported that the current daily supply of a fixed amount of cash cannot be reasonably distributed to various banks and businesses in practice, and the total amount for each week or half month should be fully supplied so that it can be planned and then rationally distributed to various banks and businesses according to the actual situation of the market.</p>
<p>Second, the issuance of credit currency to various banks and businesses originally had three systems: the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank, the Silver Union Reserve, and the Qian Union. Excluding the Yokohama Specie Bank system, our Silver Union and Qian Union have relatively strict hierarchical regulations on the issuance of payment orders and promissory notes. However, the actual amount issued and exchanged by various banks and businesses inevitably involves illegal and indiscriminate practices. For example, the indiscriminate issuance of excessively large and small denominations has extremely serious drawbacks. In the future, the qualifications of banks and businesses that are allowed to issue payment orders should be strictly regulated. Those who do not meet the qualifications should not be allowed to issue payment orders, and those who have already issued them should be ordered to recover them as soon as possible to prevent abuses. Banks and businesses shall not arbitrarily restrict withdrawals from depositors or change payments to payment orders, etc., to protect the lives of the general public.</p>
<p>In addition, it is an important measure to crack down on high discount rates, but if the above two measures can be implemented, even if there is no crackdown, the practice of high-interest discounting and exploitation will gradually subside.</p>

<h3>### U.S. Commander in the India-Burma Theater Replaced</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Lieutenant General Sultan, commander of the U.S. forces in the India-Burma Theater, has returned to Washington this time and has been concurrently appointed by Lieutenant General Holman, deputy commander of the Southeast Asia Allied Forces.

<h3>### Chongqing to Convene Fourth Wartime Council on Schedule</h3>
<p>The CCP will not send representatives to attend</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the first meeting of the Fourth National Political Council will be convened on July 7th.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Yan'an: According to a dispatch from Yan'an, the Chongqing side has decided to convene the National Political Council in Chongqing on July 7th. The CCP has announced that it will not send its party's council members to attend, which exposes the increasingly fierce friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party recently. The reasons given by the CCP side, according to the person in charge of the CCP Central Committee, are: Since September of last year, the CCP, the Democratic League, and the general democratic masses have requested the Kuomintang to abolish one-party dictatorship, convene a meeting of representatives of various political parties, establish a provisional coalition government, and implement general elections after the war, and convene a National Assembly, but the Kuomintang refused. The Kuomintang did not consult the CCP and other political parties in advance regarding the convening of the Fourth National Political Council on July 7th. The National Political Council and its members are considered to be a dictatorial organization by the Kuomintang. The National Assembly is completely occupied by the Kuomintang, which may cause division among the people and outbreak of internal strife. When the National Political Council is convened in the future, it will be forced to pass various reactionary concrete measures of the Kuomintang. If passed, it will be a serious mistake. It is reported that the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang only decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12th, and did not mention the powers of the National Assembly and the issue of delegates to the Assembly. It is planned to convene the National Political Council on July 7th to solicit opinions from outside the party before making a formal decision. The means are extremely cunning. At the same time, in Mao Zedong's political report at the Seventh National Congress in Yan'an, he opposed the convening of the National Assembly by the Kuomintang, denied the legitimacy of the Assembly, and frankly criticized this as Chongqing's attempt to incite civil war. Chongqing originally planned to use the National Political Council to cover up the truth, but was again opposed by the CCP. The CCP's failure to send representatives to attend further indicates that the CCP has severed ties with the National Assembly, and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has deteriorated further due to the issue of the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>### Elite Japanese Troops in South China Occupy San'nan, Jiangxi Province. Fierce Battle for Dingnan Underway.</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - The elite troops of the Japanese South China Army launched an attack on the Seventh War Zone of the Chongqing government in early June, and soon captured Sannan (Longnan, Qiannan, and Dingnan), Jiangxi Province, a counterattack base of the Seventh War Zone of the Chongqing government. The Chongqing government's broadcast on the 16th also acknowledged this fact as follows: The Chongqing army in Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces, after receiving reinforcements, launched a fierce battle with the Japanese army for Dingnan on the morning of the 16th. Fierce battles also broke out in the western area of the area. Also near Longti, they are currently attacking the Japanese army that occupied Anyuan, northeast of the area.</p>
<p>Guangdong, 20th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army launched operations in the Sannan area this time, they will directly encircle the Chongqing army with several columns of troops from the north and south, unexpectedly, and completely destroy the Chongqing army's base in one fell swoop, completing a major annihilation battle. On June 1st, the Japanese army dispatched two columns of troops from the Guangdong area, one column of troops from the Huizhou area, and formed one column of troops from Shaoguan, a key point on the Yuehan Line, and Nanxiong, the former base of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, and launched an attack from three sides simultaneously. On the 15th and 16th, they arrived in the Sannan area and launched a pincer attack on the main force of the 12th Army, the 63rd and 65th Armies, of the Seventh War Zone of the Chongqing army, totaling about 60,000 troops, and are currently expanding the results of the battle. The Chongqing army was also caught off guard by the sudden attack of the Japanese army and lost its composure. It failed to transport various collected materials and military supplies, resulting in all of them being captured by the Japanese army. The strength of the Seventh War Zone of the Chongqing army has been completely destroyed by this attack. Although the Chongqing army had previously claimed that the preparations for the counterattack had been completed, in reality it was nothing more than empty slogans. We can also know from the fact that the Chongqing generals Yu Hanmou and others retreated without fighting a single battle that the Chongqing side had long lost its will to fight.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - After the elite Japanese troops in South China captured the Sannan area and destroyed the enemy's counterattack base, they are currently pursuing the retreating remnants and carrying out mopping-up operations in the occupied areas to prepare for the next operation. In this operation, the enemy army was狼狠and unbearable, and the enemy general Jiang Wu retreated without fighting. Weapons, bullets, food and other military supplies were thrown all over the ground. From the beginning of this operation to the 17th, the Japanese army's battle results that have been verified include burying 805 enemy corpses, capturing 580 prisoners, intercepting 8 anti-aircraft guns, 54 various artillery pieces, 70 heavy and light machine guns, ammunition vehicles, etc.</p>

<h3>### Armed Defense as if Facing a Formidable Enemy, Polish Leaders Continue to be Tried</h3>
<p>Contents of Kotowski's Testimony</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Moscow: Sixteen Polish leaders were tried again in Moscow yesterday, and the witnesses for the prosecution were also questioned in detail. The first witness for the prosecution was Czertlinski, a 36-year-old journalist. He testified, "I was a member of the Polish National Army until mid-summer of 1942, serving as the commander-in-chief of the Second Army in the Vilnius region, and later served as the main task of propaganda and various intelligence in the region." Regarding whether he had received instructions from the Polish secret government, he replied, "Before the Soviet army entered, the government issued various orders based on diplomatic relations." The prosecutor Afanasyev hurriedly asked after hearing this, "What are diplomatic relations?" He replied, "Because the Soviet army at that time was indeed regarded as the enemy." He continued to testify, "On February 16, 1944, I received instructions from the secret government saying that the Soviet Union should be regarded as an enemy invading our country, and that all eastern regions should be regarded as enemy-occupied areas. All official propaganda activities are only through the dissemination of leaflets and pamphlets, etc." Following Czertlinski, Kotowski, the acting prime minister of the Polish government-in-exile in London, was questioned. The prosecutor asked in a stern voice, "Have you issued instructions to teach them to organize various acts of terrorism?" Kotowski replied, "The issuance of this instruction was ordered by the London authorities. The content of this instruction is nothing more than returning national power to our Polish people, so the issuance of the instruction is to enable them to seize national power, and even if it fails, the independence of Poland must be defended." The prosecutor asked, "How to defend it?" He replied, "Try to use counter-propaganda and various intelligence work." He also asked, "Is it just these two tasks?" He replied, "Yes." Later, the prosecutor's questioning of the witnesses for the prosecution and Kotowski involved issues such as illegal organization's internal meetings and contact with the Polish army in the Vilnius region. The second witness for the prosecution was Anponowaks, 23 years old. He testified, "I was a company commander in the Polish National Army. When our Polish regiment fell into the hands of the German army, we attacked the Soviet guerrillas." It is said that during the trial, the court was densely guarded by armed defense forces, all with bows drawn and swords sheathed, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p>

<h3>Five Organizations Held a Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome Five High-Ranking Officials, Encouraging Mutual Cooperation Between Officials and Civilians</h3>
<p>Five organizations, including the Municipal Advisory Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the Charity Organization, and the Shanghai Branch of the China News Association, held a joint tea party yesterday (the 20th) at 4:00 PM at the Hong Lok Restaurant to welcome the newly appointed Peng Nian, Minister of Social Welfare of the National Government; Lu Ying, Chief Aide-de-Camp; Hu Wu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; Man Qiwei, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau; and Tsukazaki, Director of the Fire Department. Chief Aide-de-Camp Lu was unable to attend due to official duties in Nanjing. The other four high-ranking officials arrived on time. Heads of various municipal agencies attending included Xu Jidun, Yuan Junchang, Fan Yongzeng, Gu Jiwu, Zhou Yuying, Watanabe, Chen Dongbai, Wu Wenwei, Zhang Kechang, Li Shiyu, Chen Qiushi, Cai Rixin, Shen Wenjie, Xia Guoliang, Wang Deyi, Cheng Deyuan, Ling Dating, Yu Zijie, Na Shaomei, Yang Shi, and Yin Shi, among others, and were received by representatives of the five organizations: Li Sihao, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and Chen Binhe. Attendees from various circles included Zhao Jinqing, Jin Xiongbai, Chen Shaoyu, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhang Deqin, Xu Jianping, Ding Fubao, Shen Siliang, Chen Riping, Gu Nanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Liqiu, Wu Huanru, Zhang Yi'ao, Zhu Yangwu, Zhou Bangjun, Kuang Zhongxian, Shen Jinzhou, Yuan Jianbo, Xie Xiaochu, Song Zhuozai, Chen Panjun, Zhao De'ao, Xia Yinqing, Yang Fusheng, Zhou Mengbai, Zhou Fubi, Bao Guochang, Chen Chengzheng, He Wuliang, Wu Yong'an, Zheng Jie, Zhu Yongkang, Fan Yifeng, Zhang Shizhi, Luo Huanzhang, Yu Yaoqiu, Liu Zhifang, Yang Guan'ao, Yang Heqing, and Shi Yucun, totaling several hundred people, gathered in a lively atmosphere. After formal greetings, Li Sihao, representing the various organizations, delivered a welcome speech, followed by thank-you speeches from Minister Peng, Deputy Secretary-General Hu, Deputy Director Man, and Director Tsukazaki. The gathering adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Li Sihao's Speech</p>
<p>Li Sihao, representing the various organizations, stated in his welcome speech: "Distinguished officials and guests: In recent years, local civic organizations in our city often hold welcome and farewell tea parties for government officials who have been promoted or transferred. Some may view this as a formality, but it actually carries two more positive meanings. One is to use this opportunity to strengthen relationships and clarify opinions between officials and civilians, so that there is no gap between the government and the people. The other is to express the enthusiasm of the people and encourage officials to love the people and seek happiness for them. Today's welcome tea party is a happy occasion to welcome five officials, all of whom are old friends of long standing, making the atmosphere particularly warm. We have special expectations for each official.</p>
<p>Minister Peng of the Ministry of Social Welfare previously assisted former Minister Ding and is known for his outstanding political achievements. Now, as Minister, he will undoubtedly be able to achieve even more with his experience. Shanghai has a great deal of social welfare work, and has had a very close relationship with the Ministry of Social Welfare in the past, which will continue in the future. The advancement of social welfare requires funding, and we hope Minister Peng will do his best to assist. We also hope that Minister Peng will provide more help in the current evacuation of Shanghai's charitable organizations.</p>
<p>Chief Aide-de-Camp Lu of the National Government's Aide-de-Camp Office has served in Shanghai's police administration for a long time and has gotten along very well with the people of Shanghai. We hope that even after his transfer to the central government as Chief Aide-de-Camp, he will not forget those far away and will provide guidance at any time.</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary-General Hu of the Municipal Government has served as the Director of the Municipal Food Bureau and Secretary-General, and is already familiar with the situation in the city. This time, he has returned to assist Secretary-General Luo and support the Mayor in promoting government affairs, which will surely meet the expectations of the citizens.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Man of the Police Bureau has also served in Shanghai's police administration. He is talented and efficient, and handles matters with seriousness. His promotion to Deputy Director is by no means accidental. The security of Shanghai is very important, and the maintenance of social livelihood is closely related to police administration. We especially rely on Deputy Director Man to provide assistance, give full play to his ambitions, and work together with senior police officers from allied nations to establish a good reputation for the police.</p>
<p>Director Tsukazaki of the Fire Department has served in Shanghai for more than 30 years and has a wealth of experience. At this stage when the decisive battle is becoming increasingly tense, enemy air raids, explosions, and fires are all expected. Therefore, fire prevention work is extremely important. We have heard that Director Tsukazaki is planning to implement a comprehensive plan to strengthen fire prevention based on his experience, and we urge him to implement it as soon as possible to reduce disasters. On the citizen's side, we will do our best to raise awareness and promote cooperation.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish all the officials a successful future, good health, and happiness."</p>
<p>Minister Peng's Speech</p>
<p>Minister Peng stated: "I am deeply honored to have the opportunity to gather with the elders and leaders from all walks of life at this warm reception hosted by the five organizations, and to receive your valuable insights. I am humbled by Elder Li's excessive praise and high expectations. The Ministry of Social Welfare is a new institution established since the National Government returned to Nanjing. There are many social problems at present, and Shanghai is different from other places. In Shanghai, leaders from all walks of life have stepped forward to plan and organize social welfare, while in other places, it all relies on the government to promote it. This is due to the economic limitations in those places. In the future, I hope that the elders and leaders in Shanghai will continue to cooperate with the Ministry with the same enthusiasm as they assisted Minister Ding in the past, and provide assistance. The Ministry will do its best to support social welfare in Shanghai to meet your expectations. I have limited talent and ability, so please do not hesitate to give me your guidance. I would be most grateful."</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary-General Hu's Speech</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary-General Hu of the Municipal Government stated: "I am extremely grateful for the welcome tea party hosted by the five organizations today. I served in Shanghai with Mayor Chen for more than two years after the Incident. I am not only deeply honored to return to this place and meet you all again today, but I also hope that you will give me more guidance in the future. Shanghai was originally one of the world's and China's major cities, and its importance is greater than that of other places. At present, Shanghai's social problems are also very serious, such as the food and security problems. The colleagues in the Municipal Government have long regarded these as the most important issues, in order to meet your expectations. I will follow Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo and do my best to contribute to all of you elders and leaders. Regarding the two major issues mentioned above, both the government and the citizens should 'cross the river in the same boat' and be 'of one heart and one mind' to jointly cooperate in the war. Cooperation in the war is of course important, but maintaining local security is even more important. I hope that all citizens can unite and endure hardships. With the determination to cross the river in the same boat, it will not be difficult to reach the other shore. I would like to report these two issues to you today and hope that we can cooperate together."</p>
<p>Deputy Director Man's Speech</p>
<p>Deputy Director Man of the Municipal Police Bureau stated: "I am deeply grateful for the reception hosted by all the seniors and leaders today. I will accept your expectations and take this opportunity to briefly report to you. The current Municipal Police Bureau seems to have achieved a little more than before. This is the result of Mayor Zhou's determination to rectify it, but it is also the manifestation of the strength of all of you seniors. I would like to express my gratitude for this. The police bear a great responsibility and are the pivot of local security. The quality of local security depends on the quality of the police. Shanghai is the economic center of the country, so local security is important, and the mission of the Municipal Police Bureau is even more important. In the future, the cooperation of leaders and seniors from all walks of life will be very urgent. I hope that you will not hesitate to give me your guidance in the future so that I can fulfill the mission I bear."</p>
<p>Director Tsukazaki's Speech</p>
<p>Director Tsukazaki of the Fire Department stated: "I feel that I am not competent to be in charge of fire prevention, but I will work hard to be dutiful since you have given me your enthusiastic expectations. The most important thing in Shanghai right now is air defense measures, so we should actively complete a solid air defense posture, and fire prevention work is one of the most important tasks in air defense. For example, cities in Europe and Japan have considerable training, so that officials and civilians can cope with bombings. But in Shanghai, no one can guarantee whether enemy aircraft will bomb us in the same way. We should pay close attention to the air defense mission so that we are prepared for any eventuality. Our office is working hard to enrich the facilities, and we hope that those with money will contribute money, and those with strength will contribute strength, so that the military, officials, and civilians can work together to promote the completion of a solid air defense posture. I will work hard in my position and hope that everyone will cooperate."</p>

<p>In view of the soaring rice prices in Nanjing and Shanghai, which have greatly affected the entire social economy, security, and people's livelihood, the National Government authorities have taken emergency measures a few days ago, and consulted with relevant parties to fully assist. It was clearly ordered that the Rice Monopoly Association and other groups should stop purchasing, and the restrictions on movement were directly lifted. After the implementation of this decisive measure, rice prices in various places gradually fell, and there is still a tendency to continue to decline. The Shanghai Coarse Grains Industry Association, in response to the government's policies, has automatically reduced the prices of red beans, mung beans, broad beans, corn, and other coarse grains in line with market prices. Starting from the 17th of this month, as a first-phase trial, all wholesale and retail members were ordered to sell at affordable prices and must not refuse. The second phase of affordable coarse grain sales has been held since yesterday (20th). All the prices in the second phase are lower on average than the first phase, by about 10,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight). It is reported that the stock of coarse grains in Shanghai is quite abundant, and the Japanese side will also release it. A universal distribution method is also being promoted quickly in conjunction with all parties, in order to hold it as soon as possible to supplement the shortage of rice sources.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Gold Certificates Can Be Cashed Starting Today</h3>

This phase of gold certificates will be issued in Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou for two days from today (21st) to the 22nd. The price is the same as the Shanghai listing. It is learned that the second phase of gold certificates issued by the bank on May 21st has reached the end of its one-month term. According to the provisions of the issuance regulations, gold will be cashed starting tomorrow (22nd).</p>
<h3>Old Zhabei Police Station Cracks Down on Street Vendors</h3>
<p>The Old Zhabei Police Station has decided to crack down on street vendors along the road in order to maintain traffic safety. At the same time, the entrances of various neighborhoods in the area are full of street vendors, which not only obstructs traffic at the entrance of the street, but also poses a danger in the event of an unexpected incident. In order to renovate the city appearance, the branch director has ordered a crackdown. Except for fixed stalls that have licenses, all other temporary stalls will be cracked down on. Those who violate the rules will be detained and fined.</p>
<h3>Penalties for Late Payment of House Tax</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that citizens often pay house tax late, the Municipal Finance Bureau has formulated temporary regulations for the collection of house tax in order to rectify tax administration. These regulations have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, stipulating that each household should pay the full amount within ten days after receiving the house tax notice. Those who fail to pay within the time limit will be charged a late payment fine of 10% of the tax amount. Those who are more than ten days late will be charged a late payment fine of 20% of the tax amount. Those who are more than twenty days late will be charged a late payment fine of 30% of the tax amount. Those who are more than one month late will have staff sent to pursue the payment, and will be charged a late payment fine of 50% of the tax amount. It is hoped that all householders will pay attention to avoid government penalties.</p>
<h3>Soap Distribution in Nanshi Starting From Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Daily Necessities Control Committee of the General Chamber of Commerce has decided that from June 23rd to 27th, soap retailers in the urban area will start selling one piece of Huang Xiangmao household soap with the No. 43 comprehensive distribution certificate. The price is set at 500 yuan in national currency, including retail tax. Citizens in the area can purchase soap from the soap retailer with the same number as the number on the certificate.</p>
<h3>Soaring Prices in Shanghai Affect the Exchange of Materials</h3>
<p>The movement of materials in and out has been very smooth under the controlled permit system. Although the quantity of materials moved in the Central China region has gradually decreased compared with last month, the transportation tools are significantly smoother than before. The movement of materials into the North China, South China, Huaihai, and Wuhan regions is still normal. It is reported that due to the impact of soaring prices in Shanghai, the price of materials in various parts of Central China has reached equilibrium. Therefore, wholesale and retail traders have no profit to operate, and the export volume has decreased accordingly. However, this price equilibrium has adverse effects on wartime material exchange. If the price of goods in Shanghai is not suppressed, the supply of materials needed by the people will lose its original purpose of exchange.</p>
<h3>Economic Police Arrest Criminals in Illegal Discounting Case, Will Be Severely Punished for Disrupting Finance</h3>
<p>The Economic Police Corps of the Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the current shortage of cash in the market, and the fact that general non-financial institutions, money exchange shops, vendors, and even illegal merchants are using the allocation slips of the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank Joint Reserve Association and the Money Industry Reserve to obtain huge amounts of interest, exploit the people, and seek illegal profits, has instructed all detachments to mobilize the entire economic police force to conduct strict investigations in all areas, markets, and shops of the city, and strictly crack down on this illegal behavior. It is learned that the detachments have arrested dozens of criminals one after another. All of them have been detained and no one is allowed to be released on bail. The matter has been submitted to the superiors for instructions. It is reported that they will be severely punished according to the law for disrupting finance. In addition, all silver and money industry firms have automatically stopped the illegal discounting of allocation slips for profit.</p>
<p>Financial Inspection Office Has Found Solid Evidence</p>
<p>In view of the increasingly rampant practice of discounting allocation slips issued by various banks and money houses, the Central Reserve Bank has found that unscrupulous financial institutions and money exchange vendors are charging high interest rates for swapping allocation slips, reaching as much as two corners, disrupting finance and exploiting citizens. In order to eliminate the evil practice of discounting and stabilize finance, the Central Reserve Bank has sent Zhang Guru, the director of the inspection team of the Financial Inspection Office, along with his staff, to various financial institutions to conduct inspections and strictly crack down on it. Real evidence of illegal discounting by a certain financial institution has been found and reported to the department for strict punishment. According to a reporter's investigation, although the Central Reserve Bank is conducting strict inspections and crackdowns, unscrupulous financial institutions are still secretly discounting. The general public hopes that the Central Reserve Bank will continue to thoroughly investigate and crack down on it, and at the same time increase the amount of cash withdrawn by various financial institutions, prohibit the abuse of allocation slips, and supervise the financial institutions to release the amount of cash withdrawn by customers as much as possible in order to adjust the cash needs of the market.</p>
