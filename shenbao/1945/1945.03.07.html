<h3>琉黃島展開出戰　日軍殲敵兩萬名　仍堅守各陣地抵抗力增強</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電日大本營六日下午三時發表：琉黃島之日軍部隊，邇來對於逐次由陣地間隙侵入之優勢敵軍，自三月四日前後，仍據守玉名山·大阪山·東山·漂流木北部落附近之各劇點，善以寡兵與敵勇敢戰鬥中。該島日軍守備部隊自敵登陸以來，於陸地予敵之損害，迄今已判明之重要者如次：殺傷敵兵的二萬名，擱坐燃燒敵戰車約二百五十輛。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電琉黃島日軍在敵軍熾烈攻擊下，仍確保各陣地，敵軍不惜損失，仍繼續攻擊，該島戰局極爲緊張。四日晨敵軍向日軍各據點開始全面進攻，俞軒家方面之敵軍以戰車十餘輛進攻，遭日軍砲擊及白刃戰鬥，至該日夕，敵攻擊漸趨衰頽，但仍不斷以艦砲迫擊砲射擊。四日深夜日軍突入各地區之敵軍陣地，予以相當損害。敵戰鬥機多架於五日出動呼應地上作戰，以機關槍掃射，再度展開攻勢，刻在日軍陣前展開激戰中。玉名山方面，敵軍約百名五日乘大型機一架降落該地。大阪山方面之日軍，在敵軍重圍繼續奮戰，並組織突擊隊潛入敵軍陣營。據五日晨判明者，僅四日一日間之戰果，即殺傷敵軍一千一百五十名，擱坐其戰車六輛。</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　美聯社前綫特派員五日報吿琉黃島戰况如次：太平洋戰爭中流血最大之戰，在殺聲震天中已邁進至第二週間，日軍守備部隊刻正繼續死鬥，其抵抗力亦逐加强烈，在火山性岩穴噴咽之琉黃烟中，兩軍爲爭寸土而展開壯烈之衝鋒戰。尼米資曾發表稱，戰綫在實質上無變化，及日軍之抵抗異常頑强，而其彈火逐漸猛烈，藉此數點亦可窺知該島戰况之熾烈矣。又美軍水上艦艇雖仍與空軍實行呼應攻擊，然日軍仍在向南飛行塲陸續發射巨彈中。</p>
<h3>日本實施　國民勤勞動員</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日政府曾於本年初，決定五大重要施策，其第四項中，闡明確立勞力態勢及國民勤勞動員之實施方針，一月二十日召開國家總動員審議會時，決定國民勤勞動員之勅令要綱。嗣以厚生省爲中心，進行各種手續，六日以官報公佈國民勤勞動員令，自七日起施行該勅令。爲期國民勤勞動員綜合化，與機動性的運營，與旣往之國民徵用令·勞務調整令·學校卒業者使用制限令·國民動勞報國協力令·及女子挺身勤勞令之有關動員之法令打成一片。其主要內容爲確立產業要員制·勤勞動員之合理化·動員方面之整頓·機動配置制之强化·以及空製時勤勞機動對策之確立等，其中幷以確立要員制爲中心，而强化粽合產業動員與推進機動配置，此將形成今後日本勤勞動員行政之二大主流。</p>
<h3>日軍作戰精神　德報備致頌揚</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　日軍近於硫黃島之奮鬥，已使東西兩綫對敵作戰之德國軍民，受莫大感動。「人民觀察報」六日曾讀美日軍壯烈之血戰如次：依恃龐天物量來襲之美軍，自登陸後兩週以來，已被日軍斃敵萬餘名，日軍之苦戰，實乃二十世紀之英雄行爲，日軍從容牲犧之精神力，非美軍殺人利器可比，硫黃島之英雄，將永爲日本後代子孫當史詩而歌詠也。</p>
<h3>日空軍轟炸　雷伊泰機場</h3>
<p>菲律賓基地六日中央社電　日本空軍於五日未明，轟炸雷伊泰島東岸塔拉克附近之敵飛行塲及軍事設施，予以相當損害</p>
<h3>英艦隊司令談　太平洋戰局</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　太平洋英艦隊司令弗拉塞於五日發表談話謂：英國艦隊現正準備與美海軍在太平洋作共同行動，英艦隊百分之五十爲航空母艦，美常同已承認母艦所載飛機有極大價值。歐洲及太平洋戰爭現已達最高峯，吾人艦隊正準備與日艦隊交戰，然日艦隊目前雖退至其本國附近，但俟英美艦隊接近日本，而日本陸上基地飛機可能援護時，定必出擊應戰云。又弗拉塞對於英艦隊是否單獨與日艦隊交戰之問題談稱，英日艦隊如在某地區接觸，余不能預測其結果如何云云，察其言詞，英艦隊似無單獨戰勝日海軍之把握，不過希望隨從美海軍作戰。另一方面則欲對全世界宣傳英艦隊如何活潑情形，實爲英帝國慣用之宣傳手段耳。</p>
<h3>美機十餘架　空襲河內</h3>
<p>河內五日中央社電　駐渝美空軍戰鬥機及轟炸機十餘架，五日下午一時起至四時十分，波狀攻擊市內，對市內用機鎗掃射後，並轟炸近郊數處。</p>

<h3>奮戰到底　備富蘇峰</h3>
<p>年邁的我，比別人過紀元節的次數，自然較多。然而在這許多次中，最令人永矢不忘者，只有兩次。一次就是明治二十二年二月十一日，即日本帝國頒佈憲法的那天。那天東京的市街上雪花紛飛，我們在雪地上捧讀着新頒佈的憲法號外。第二次就是今年的紀元節。在我們日本臣民迎接今日紀元節的時候，敵機九十架來轟炸我關東地帶。這種異族來擾我本土的事件，尚屬二千六百餘年來的創舉。我們面對着當前的事件，應當大加反省，應當大加奮勉。</p>
<p>我們在紀元節這樣慶祝的日子，也不能不把事實當作事實來談。今日的日本，眞是立於危急存亡之秋了。如一步走錯，則會跌落萬丈深淵，無法再起。我們走了三年勝利之路，正當捷報頻傳中，敵人業巳大步逼近日本京城的關口。美國業已盤據馬利亞納羣島了，現在菲律賓的大戰方酣。但日本的將士都英勇戰鬥，忠烈用命，這不僅日本人完全相信，即敵人也不得不承認。事實雖如此，然而每一個日本人都該知道，此次戰爭是不能疏忽，不能安心，而滿手捏着冷汗的危險戰爭。</p>
<p>菲島的得失，實在是主要關鍵。形勢旣如此嚴重，那末我們在紀元節這一天，應當作些什麼？一部分人對於過去的醉生夢死，馬虎鬆懈，敷衍了事這種行爲，應痛加反省。我們的口頭上，固然都是盡善盡美，頭頭是道，但行爲上，却是我行我素，好逸惡勞，對於這一點我們應當作一絕大的懺悔。還要袪除過去一切的虛爲，狡詐，苟安等思想，脫去襤褸齪齪的衣履，滌除身上的泥垢，使心身一新，這是軍政民三界，都應當注意的事，此其一。第二就是在紀元佳節的今天，應當對皇國歷史加以追源溯始，理解日本民族的悠久傳統及大難，必須絕對信賴皇國，建立皇國的信心，以打破當前的艱苦局面</p>
<p>凡是一個戰爭，總需要很多方面的東西。至了今天，戰爭本身是最複雜錯綜的事情。有的人說，只須有飛機，就會取得勝利，還有的人說，只須有潛水艇，就會勝利。更有的人說，坦克救國；更有的人說科學救國；又有的人說物資救國；又有的人說人力資源救國等等。這都是各就自己的立塲，而强調自己應當作的事。但，作戰是極其複雜的　決不能以一已而度萬人，以一事而衡量萬事。我們只有說，每一個人的工作，都非常需要。</p>
<p>再進一步說，有一物能與一切有關者，即必勝信念。日本國決非戰敗國。日本人決非屈辱投降的人民。我們皇國，最後總歸是勝利的。這一信念，應當於一億人民當中的每個心坎裏。中途縱有困難和挫折，也無須担心。只有堅信最後勝利，上天才能賜以最後勝利。試看神武天皇東征的事實，就可恍然大悟。</p>
<p>神武天島四十五歲時，離開高千穩宮，而走上東征之途。儘管在途中，曾作過極大的準備，曾在浪速之津擱淺過相當時日，尤有甚者，當經河內入大和特，曾遭遇過極大的困難。於是便實行一大迂回，而赴海路態野，再由態野溯江而上，經吉野而至大和平野。</p>
<p>於是在臨原建都即位，當時爲五十二歲。即按時間言，我們目前的大東亞戰爭，尚不及神武東征之一半。所以我們必須決心沉着鎭靜，堅持到底。這一決心，決非無理由的。即由堅信最後勝利而產生的決心，是極其自然而合理的。可以說，知己知彼，百戰不殆。我們必須知道，敵美現在所處的地位如何。他們依仗物資的豐富，而企圖一氣打倒日本，但在此也就暴露着他們的最大弱點。他們現在想破益沉舟地來擊潰我們，這就是因爲他們內部具有不能持久的弱點。假如我們能够堅持到底，則他們很快就筋疲力竭，無術可施，接着定會自消自滅。他們現在也是欲罷不能，他們懸軍萬里的兵站綫愈長，則弱點愈甚。所以我們按國史上的一大敎訓，有始有終地堅持必勝信念，百折不撓，以逸待勞。聚而殲之。我在紀元節這一天，捧讀神武創業的偉大敎訓，我們用新的精神，用新的作風，再度克服困難。（林譯自二月十二日每日新聞）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>認識與奮鬥</h3>
<p>德富翁最近在日本每日新聞發表一文，題爲「奮鬥到底」，（譯文見今日本報）我們讀了後，覺得時局愈艱難，輿論界的責任愈重大。德富翁是日本新聞界前輩，正因爲他的年事高，經歷過的民族危雞比別人多，體騐到的敎訓也比別人深刻，因此對於當前困難的認識，也較能透澈切實，所以每當時局緊迫之際，他無不置個人利害於度外，作緊急的呼籲，發揮一個新聞記者的責任與精神。我們對於時事的評論，所以不嫌煩複，也無非是受這種責任與精神的驅策，而後「知無不言，言無不盡」的。</p>
<p>德當先生在「奮戰到底」一文中向其同胞指出了三點：第一，作事要切實負責，勤勞誠樸，必須言行一致；第二，理解日本民族的肇國精神，建立皇國必勝的信念，打破難關；第三，堅到到底，爭取勝利。這二點，除了第一點我們應同樣的作更大的反省外，對於第二第三兩點，我們應從理論上去理解日本民族的奮鬥的歷史精神，信賴日本，實殘同生共死的諾言，協力戰爭，奮鬥到底。</p>
<p>以盟邦這樣健全的政事，國家意議很旺盛的民族，德富翁猶恐一部份有「醉生夢死，馬虎鬆懈，敷衍了事」的行爲，或者在口頭上「盡善盡美」，而行爲上却是「我行我素，好逸惡勞」的事情，要求國民，有則改之，無則加勉。返觀我國的政事和民氣怎樣呢？這種缺點，從前表現於政事上的，經過當局者一番整飭改革之後，表面上振作了很多，但是，根本上的病源，還須作更多的淸除，以求澈底纔好。否則稍一鬆懈，則過去我們所引爲痛心的「不顧國家崇高目的，不顧民族存亡興替，只圖自肥自私」和「漠不關心危局與困難，敷衍塞責，順水推舟，食君祿，享國俸的寄生虫」等的敗壞現象，可能又乘機發作。</p>
<p>日本國民要從歷史上去理解皇國締造的艱難經過，要從歷史的經騐敎訓中去體會出勝利的艱苦過程，以之堅定信心，得能認淸克服當前危機和爭取勝利的關鍵，是繫於能否堅持到底。而我們要去理解日本民族歷史上的奮鬥精神，是要拿歷史來證明日本必能堅持奮戰到底，此其一。第二，信賴日本共存共榮的理論的準確性；第三，堅持到底的戰略，必定勝利。</p>
<p>歷史是最眞實的證明，日本二千六百餘年的歷史中，每一次的危難，都足以證明日本民族的奮鬥精神，神武天皇經過八年苦鬥而得即位橿原，這是日本民族堅毅不屈的歷史例子。至今更加發揚着，塞班，迭尼安等島的官民全體壯烈戰死，以及神風精神，凡此都是眼前的事實，證明愈威脅到日本民族的生存時，日本民族的寗死不屈，並非一種宣傳。而深曉日本的格魯，不能不承認「此次之硫黃島作戰，美軍損失甚大之原因，乃日軍奮戰之結果」。</p>
<p>敵美在戰略上的弱點，是在「企圖一氣打倒日本」，如果日本準對他們內部不能持久的弱點，採取堅持到底的戰略，則敵美必須在太平洋的島嶼上，日本本土和中國大陸上來應戰，這樣，戰爭的結局，勝利誰屬，我們不難想象。</p>
<p>目前的局勢，如此急迫，將來的希望，又如此的遠大，我國是大東亞戰爭中的一員，我們應該更加認識與奮鬥。</p>

<h3>衆目集中的　米市場——周家橋</h3>
<p>— 熙</p>
<p>周家橋是滬西的一個地名，因爲是米糧販賣的集中地，所以年來爲上海市民所格外注意。記者昨晨七時雇車前往，經過靜安寺路折入愚閱路，過了中山公園就帶了農村的氣息，路旁的屋舍都是些低矮的瓦房，一些老太少女，壯年漢子，以及十二三歲的兒童，已三三南兩背負着一袋一袋的米魚貫向東，越朝西走這些人羣就越多起來，這正是報吿我們是接近米市塲——周家橋了。</p>
<p>過了西站（梵王渡路站）就只見萬頭在鑽動着，在白利南路的兩旁就滿眼的陳列着一袋袋一　匾匾的米，後面立着的就是這些米的主人，前面團着許多携帶着空的洋麵袋的那些正是從市區來的顧客，這其中有的是一些用戶，有的也是米販，彼此在品評着米質，爭論着價錢，計算着份量，喧擾成一片。馬路兩側的店家就有三分之一以上是米糧和雜糧行。</p>
<p>周家橋當地是並不產米的，現在這里也不過是一個米糧集散地而已，這里米糧完全是從黃渡經北新涇而運來的，或由蘇州的水路，或由公路綫陸運，黃渡米價現在不過四萬元，但因淸鄉封鎖及其他種種阻礙致不易運過，所以相差僅六十里的路途，在價格上就距離了一大半，這眞是難於令人置信的事。黃渡的米多數是從蘇州，無錫方面輸入的，前些日子蘇州，無錫的米價。僅僅二萬五千元一石，最近因受上海的反影響才能漲到三萬元一石，這種一地一價的現象多少是不合理的。</p>
<p>周家橋的米價是很爲全上海市民關心的，昨天該地薄稻的價格是每石九萬三千元至九萬五千元，黃薄稻是每石八萬八千元至九萬元，洋稙是每石九萬元。比市區內的價錢也不過便宜每石四五千元的車力運費而已，這原來是到了周家橋的米糧是已經完了一道一道的關卡的剝削，同時也用光了各色各樣的開消，到了周家橋以後已不再需要任何的費用了，所以一個不大熟悉這情形的人如果從市區中心乘了黃包車來周家橋買米，再乘黃包車運回去，那計算起來有時是會比從弄堂口米販手中買來的米還要貴些的。　由於這兒是米的集散地，所以這里也有大量的稻草集散，在這兒的蘇州河中停泊着一大船一大船的稻草足有二三百條，這些稻草都是供給浴室購用的，自煤斤來源稀少之後，在浴室里稻草已經成爲一種極普通的代用品了。現在這里有柴行二十多家，都做稻草生意，豆楷只促少數，至於其他燃料如木柴這兒是很少的。</p>

<h3>市經濟局計劃強化　各業公會機構　調查工作完畢後實施調整</h3>
<p>市經濟局鑒於本市工商各業同業公會組織散漫，機構殊欠健全，其中亦有業別性質留同之公會組織者，因而時有引起同業糾紛，各業公會理監事人選是否適當，影響同業會員福利及政府推行戰時經濟國策，至重且鉅。故該局最近對於全市各業公會組織機構，積極籌劃强化調整，對於（一）內部組織機構不健全，（二）理監事實歷不適當，（三）業別性質相同，（四）內部空洞無實際工作者，均責令改組合併，或予以取締。茲悉該局整理各架公會整個計劃，大體已決定，即將着手進行。其整理步驟，先派員普遍關查各業公會內部組織系統，理監事人選之資歷，經濟狀况，俟普遍調查工作完畢後，視其實際會務情形，分門別類，賣令改組或予合併，務使各業公會內部組織機構健全，實際負起能謀同業福利事業完成戰時經濟使命。</p>

<h3>北站黑帽子行兇　少婦被毆慘死　兇手逃逸警局嚴緝中</h3>
<p>鎭江人許森之妻徐佩文，住本市閘北新張路新德興里二十一號，近因滬地疏散人口，將婆母及三歲幼女，擬送回鎭江原籍，當於三月四日上午二時至北站四號售票處守候至天明七時，被車站黑帽子蔣士彥無故痛毆，繼將頭髪揪住，拖赴其辦公室內毆打，致身受重傷多處，當送靶子路上海療養院，將腰子取出，已被擊碎，延至翌日上午一時四十五分不治逝世。兇手聞聞訊逃逸，北站分局據報後，當即派警緝兇未獲，遂向華中鐵道當局交涉，請求協緝，一面由警局派出大批暗探，日夜嚴緝，務獲懲辦。</p>
<h3>代征捲烟消費稅　財局設委會</h3>
<p>上海特別市財政局，自羅　局長蒞任以來，整頓稅收，不遺餘力，雖爲時未久，而各種捐稅均有顯著之增加。近復鑒於捲烟零傷消費特稅，過去經征機構未臻健全，征收辦法復不一致，爰特組設代征捲烟零售消費特稅委員會，委派捲烟界代表及有經騐之專家俞靄裕，江森裕，張大連，楊秉彝，譚廷澤，須文祥，葉雲芳，翁秉耀，陳伯　九人爲委員，負責辦理全市捲烟零售消費特稅征解事宜，並派財政局專員二人督導推動。該會已於本年三月四日，在定安路（舊稱麥高包祿路）一四八號組織成立，同時舉行第一次委員會議，通過組織章程各要案，現正趕辦一廳手續。聞對於配給捲烟消費特稅，已規定自第四十八期起征收，非配給捲烟消費特稅，規定由各烟廠協助代征。</p>

<h3>上海站分局力謀　消滅黑市票</h3>
<p>市警局上海站分局局長劉震中，鑒於黑市車票，雖極力設法肅淸，但仍未能澈底完成該分局之職責，爲求絕對消滅黑市票起見，聞已擬具統盤計劃，刻正呈請核示中。</p>
<h3>本市陸上交通　漸趨通暢</h3>
<p>市政常局正謀疏散本市人口之際，交通工具之暢通，實爲先决問題。記者爲此特走訪華中鐵道公司何理事，據何氏談稱：該公司前因燃料關係，曾一度將班次減少，最近燃料問題，已吿解決，除原定班次照常行駛外，並於前日起將京滬夜班快車，先行恢復。其他該公司所屬各綫長途汽車，亦均照常行駛，故本市陸上交通，已漸趨通暢。關於疏散本市人口，該公司亦負交通方面一部份責任，將來如何疏散，當局正在積極計劃中。至於北站情形，經與警察當局，一再努力之結果，情形日見改善，惟最近市民自動疏散離滬者爲數頗多，乘客擁擠，致使北站秩序，復形不良。旅客雖購得車票，因乘客擁擠，無法登車者，可逕向指定地點退票，或向站長室聲明理由，經站長蓋章證明後，仍可持原票於下次列車通用。</p>
<p>讀書助學消息</p>
<h3>本局受助學生　加發書籍用品補助費</h3>
<p>本屆助學金分配，依照開學時收到捐款總數，與各校大政收費數目，通盤估計，頻感運用見絀，因此決定限助舊生，不敢新生。並規定各級學生普通助金最高限額爲高小五千元，初中八千五百元，高中及專科一萬二千元，大學二萬元。雖較上屆增加百分之一百五十至二百三十三，但較各校學費之增加，相距甚遠，因之受助學生未能得到充分助力，同人深引爲憾。惟最近一月以來，承讀者踴躍捐款，源源而來，而四團體合辦之義賣市塲及本報助金生主辦之義演成績亦俱超過預算。爲使新生亦得受助機會，乃由義賣市塲委員會提出五百餘萬元，撥付各校，補助申新兩報助貸學金生以外之淸塞學生。本報亦決定於義演所得提出若干成撥付銷票成績最佳數校，同樣辦理。凡此兩事，均爲補救本屆不收新生之辦法。此外，本服助學金委員會復爲補救前此限於捐款而未能提高助金數目之缺憾，擬將一月以來所收捐欲，再行分配補助，經即議決加發受助學生書籍用品補助費，數目如次：</p>
<p>高小每人一千五百元，</p>
<p>初中每人二千五百元，</p>
<p>高中及專科每人四千元，</p>
<p>大學每人五千元，</p>
<p>分發日期及手續另行公佈，準備於本月底以前發淸。委員會又決定以餘敷委託醫院辦理受助學生醫藥治療補助事宜，詳細辦法容再公佈。自四月份起再行從事受助學生之朝綜工作。此次讀者諸君於開學之後仍踴躍捐款，各委員鑒於學生淸寒情形，決將存款儘量補發各生，希望各生此後能更加努力求學，毋負讀者諸君之熱忱及本報同人之苦心，不勝企幸。</p>
<p>昨收助金　滬鑒一部份同人三萬元，程兆熒（代二房東宋君交來）二萬五千元，士口四百元。共收五萬五千四百元，結存九百七十二萬八千九百五十三元〇三分。</p>

<h3>Iwo Jima Battle Unfolds: Japanese Forces Annihilate 20,000 Enemy Troops, Steadfastly Defending Positions, Resistance Intensifies</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 6th: In recent days, the Japanese forces on Iwo Jima have been bravely battling against the superior enemy forces that have gradually infiltrated through gaps in the defensive lines. Since around March 4th, they have continued to hold strategic points near Mount Suribachi, Mount Osaka, Mount Higashi, and the northern section of Driftwood, fighting valiantly with limited troops. Since the enemy's landing, the Japanese garrison on the island has inflicted the following confirmed significant damage on the enemy on land: 20,000 enemy soldiers killed or wounded; approximately 250 enemy tanks immobilized and burned.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Under intense enemy attacks, the Japanese forces on Iwo Jima continue to secure their positions. The enemy, disregarding losses, continues its attacks. The battle situation on the island is extremely tense. On the morning of the 4th, the enemy launched a full-scale offensive against the Japanese strongholds. The enemy forces on the Yuxuanjia front attacked with over ten tanks, encountering Japanese artillery fire and bayonet fighting. By evening, the enemy's attacks had gradually weakened, but they continued to bombard with naval guns and mortars. Late on the night of the 4th, Japanese forces infiltrated enemy positions in various areas, inflicting considerable damage. Multiple enemy fighter planes were dispatched on the 5th to support ground operations, strafing with machine guns and launching another offensive. Fierce fighting is currently unfolding in front of the Japanese lines. In the Mount Suribachi area, approximately one hundred enemy soldiers landed on the 5th in a large aircraft. The Japanese forces in the Mount Osaka area continue to fight fiercely while heavily surrounded, and have organized commando teams to infiltrate enemy lines. According to assessments on the morning of the 5th, the battle results for the 4th alone included 1,150 enemy soldiers killed or wounded and six enemy tanks immobilized.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) – An Associated Press correspondent at the front reported on the 5th regarding the battle situation on Iwo Jima: The bloodiest battle in the Pacific War has entered its second week amid deafening battle cries. The Japanese garrison continues to fight to the death, and its resistance is growing increasingly intense. In the volcanic, smoke-filled caves of Iwo Jima, both armies are engaged in heroic charges to seize every inch of ground. Admiral Nimitz stated that there have been no substantial changes in the battle lines and that the Japanese resistance is exceptionally stubborn, with their firepower gradually increasing. These points alone reveal the intensity of the battle on the island. Furthermore, although American naval vessels continue to coordinate attacks with the air force, the Japanese are still launching large-caliber shells at the southern airfield.</p>
<h3>Japan Implements National Labor Mobilization</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government decided on five major policies at the beginning of this year. The fourth item clearly outlines the establishment of a labor force structure and the implementation of national labor mobilization. During the National General Mobilization Deliberation Council meeting on January 20th, the draft outline of the Imperial Ordinance on National Labor Mobilization was decided upon. Subsequently, with the Ministry of Health and Welfare as the central body, various procedures were carried out. On the 6th, the National Labor Mobilization Ordinance was promulgated in the official gazette and implemented from the 7th. To comprehensively and flexibly operate national labor mobilization, related mobilization laws such as the National Conscription Ordinance, the Labor Adjustment Ordinance, the Ordinance Restricting the Use of School Graduates, the National Labor Service Cooperation Ordinance, and the Women's Volunteer Labor Ordinance will be integrated. The main contents include establishing an industrial essential personnel system, rationalizing labor mobilization, streamlining mobilization aspects, strengthening the mobile deployment system, and establishing mobile countermeasures for labor during air raids. Among these, establishing an essential personnel system is the central focus, and strengthening comprehensive industrial mobilization and promoting mobile deployment will form the two major trends in future Japanese labor mobilization administration.</p>
<h3>German Media Praises Japanese Fighting Spirit</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army's recent struggle on Iwo Jima has deeply moved the German military and civilians fighting the enemy on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. The "People's Observer" reported on the 6th about the fierce bloodbath between the American and Japanese forces: The American forces, relying on overwhelming material strength, have suffered over ten thousand casualties at the hands of the Japanese forces since landing two weeks ago. The Japanese army's bitter struggle is truly a heroic act of the twentieth century. The Japanese army's spirit of calmly sacrificing themselves cannot be compared to the American's instruments of death. The heroes of Iwo Jima will forever be sung in epic poems by future generations of Japan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Bombs Leyte Airfield</h3>
<p>Philippine Base, 6th (Central News Agency) – Before dawn on the 5th, the Japanese Air Force bombed enemy airfields and military facilities near Tacloban on the eastern coast of Leyte Island, inflicting considerable damage.</p>
<h3>British Fleet Commander Discusses Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – British Pacific Fleet Commander Fraser stated on the 5th: The British fleet is currently preparing to conduct joint operations with the American Navy in the Pacific. Fifty percent of the British fleet consists of aircraft carriers, and the Americans have already acknowledged the immense value of the aircraft carried by the carriers. The war in Europe and the Pacific has now reached its peak. Our fleet is preparing to engage the Japanese fleet, but although the Japanese fleet has retreated to the vicinity of its home country, it will certainly launch an attack when the British and American fleets approach Japan and Japanese land-based aircraft are able to provide support. Furthermore, when asked whether the British fleet would engage the Japanese fleet independently, Fraser stated that he could not predict the outcome if the British and Japanese fleets were to encounter each other in a certain area. Judging from his words, the British fleet seems to lack confidence in independently defeating the Japanese navy, but hopes to follow the American Navy in operations. On the other hand, it is attempting to publicize to the world how active the British fleet is, which is a common propaganda tactic used by the British Empire.</p>

<h3>Fight to the End, Prepare for Mt. Fuji</h3>
<p>As an old man, I have celebrated the National Foundation Day more times than most people. However, among these many times, there are only two that I will never forget. The first was February 11th, Meiji 22nd, the day the Constitution of the Japanese Empire was promulgated. On that day, snowflakes were falling in the streets of Tokyo, and we read the newly promulgated Constitution extra edition in the snow. The second is this year's National Foundation Day. As we Japanese subjects welcome today's National Foundation Day, ninety enemy planes came to bomb the Kanto area. This incident of foreign tribes disturbing our homeland is a first in more than 2,600 years. Faced with the current events, we should reflect greatly and strive greatly.</p>
<p>On a celebratory day like National Foundation Day, we cannot avoid talking about the facts as they are. Today's Japan is truly standing at a critical moment of survival. If we take a wrong step, we will fall into an abyss and be unable to rise again. We have walked a path of victory for three years, and just as good news was being reported frequently, the enemy has taken big steps closer to the gateway to the Japanese capital. The United States has already seized the Mariana Islands, and the battle in the Philippines is now in full swing. But the Japanese soldiers are fighting bravely and loyally giving their lives, which not only the Japanese completely believe, but even the enemy cannot deny. Even so, every Japanese person should know that this war cannot be neglected, cannot be taken lightly, and is a dangerous war with cold sweat on our hands.</p>
<p>The gain or loss of the Philippines is truly the key. Since the situation is so serious, then what should we do on this National Foundation Day? Some people should deeply reflect on their past behavior of living in a drunken dream, being careless and lax, and perfunctorily handling matters. Our words are, of course, all good and perfect, and everything makes sense, but in action, we do our own thing, love ease and hate work. We should make a great confession about this. We must also eliminate all past hypocrisy, cunning, and thoughts of temporary peace, take off our tattered and dirty clothes, and wash away the dirt from our bodies, so that our minds and bodies can be renewed. This is something that the military, government, and people should all pay attention to, this is the first. The second is that on this happy National Foundation Day, we should trace back to the source of the history of the Imperial Kingdom, understand the long tradition and great difficulties of the Japanese nation, and absolutely trust the Imperial Kingdom, establish confidence in the Imperial Kingdom, in order to break the current difficult situation.</p>
<p>Any war requires many things. Today, war itself is the most complex and intricate thing. Some people say that we only need airplanes to win, and others say that we only need submarines to win. Still others say that tanks can save the country; others say that science can save the country; others say that materials can save the country; and others say that human resources can save the country, and so on. These are all emphasizing what they should do from their own standpoints. But, war is extremely complicated, and we can never judge everyone by one person, or measure everything by one thing. We can only say that everyone's work is very important.</p>
<p>To go a step further, there is one thing that can be related to everything, that is, the conviction of victory. Japan is definitely not a defeated country. The Japanese people are definitely not people who will surrender in humiliation. Our Imperial Kingdom will eventually be victorious. This belief should be in every heart of the 100 million people. Even if there are difficulties and setbacks along the way, there is no need to worry. Only by firmly believing in final victory can heaven bestow final victory. Looking at the facts of Emperor Jinmu's eastern expedition, we can suddenly understand.</p>
<p>When Emperor Jinmu was forty-five years old, he left the Takachiho Palace and embarked on the path of the eastern expedition. Although he had made great preparations along the way, he had run aground in Naniwa-no-Tsu for a considerable period of time. Even more so, when entering Yamato through Kawachi, he encountered great difficulties. So he made a great detour and went to the sea route Tateno, and then went up the river from Tateno, through Yoshino to the Yamato Plain.</p>
<p>Then he built the capital and ascended the throne in Kasuhara, at the age of fifty-two. In terms of time, our current Greater East Asia War is not even half of Emperor Jinmu's eastern expedition. Therefore, we must be determined to remain calm and persevere to the end. This determination is not without reason. That is, the determination born of firmly believing in final victory is extremely natural and reasonable. It can be said that if you know yourself and your enemy, you will never be defeated. We must know what position the enemy Americans are in now. They rely on the abundance of materials and attempt to defeat Japan in one fell swoop, but this also exposes their greatest weakness. They are now trying to smash the boat and sink it to defeat us, because they have an internal weakness that cannot last. If we can persevere to the end, then they will soon be exhausted and unable to do anything, and then they will naturally disappear. They are now unable to stop, and the longer their supply line of thousands of miles is, the greater their weakness. Therefore, according to a great lesson in national history, we must persist in the belief of victory from beginning to end, never give up, wait for the enemy to tire, gather and annihilate them. On this National Foundation Day, I read the great teachings of Emperor Jinmu's founding. We will overcome difficulties again with a new spirit and a new style. (Translated by Lin from the February 12th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Understanding and Striving</h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Tokutomi published an article in the Japan Mainichi Shimbun titled "Strive to the End" (translation found in today's newspaper). After reading it, we feel that the more difficult the times, the greater the responsibility of the journalistic community. Mr. Tokutomi is a veteran of the Japanese press. Precisely because of his advanced age and more experience with national crises than others, the lessons he has learned are also more profound. Therefore, his understanding of the current difficulties is also more thorough and practical. Thus, whenever the situation becomes urgent, he always puts personal gain aside to make urgent appeals, demonstrating the responsibility and spirit of a journalist. Our commentaries on current affairs are also driven by this sense of responsibility and spirit, hence "knowing everything, saying everything."</p>
<p>In his article "Strive to the End," Mr. Tokutomi pointed out three things to his compatriots: first, be practical and responsible in doing things, be diligent and honest, and be consistent in words and deeds; second, understand the founding spirit of the Japanese nation, establish unwavering belief in the victory of the Imperial State, and overcome difficulties; third, persevere to the end and strive for victory. Apart from the first point, which we should similarly reflect on to a greater extent, for the second and third points, we should theoretically understand the historical spirit of struggle of the Japanese nation, trust Japan, truly keep the promise of shared life and death, cooperate in the war, and strive to the end.</p>
<p>Even with such a sound political system and a nation with a strong sense of national purpose, Mr. Tokutomi is still concerned that some may exhibit "living in a dream, being careless and lax, and perfunctory" behavior, or say "everything is perfect" in words but "do as they please, indulging in ease and hating work" in deeds. He asks the people to correct these if they exist, and strive to improve if they do not. Looking back at our country's political affairs and public morale, how are they? These shortcomings, which were previously manifested in political affairs, have been greatly revitalized on the surface after a series of rectifications and reforms by the authorities. However, the root causes of the illness still need to be further eradicated to achieve thoroughness. Otherwise, if we slacken even slightly, the corrupt phenomena that we used to find distressing, such as "disregarding the noble purpose of the nation, disregarding the survival and prosperity of the nation, and only seeking personal gain and selfishness" and "being indifferent to the crisis and difficulties, being perfunctory and irresponsible, going with the flow, and parasites who eat the emperor's salary and enjoy the nation's stipend," may take the opportunity to recur.</p>
<p>The Japanese people must understand the difficult process of building the Imperial State from history, and they must appreciate the arduous process of victory from historical experiences and lessons, so as to strengthen their confidence and be able to recognize that the key to overcoming the current crisis and striving for victory lies in whether they can persevere to the end. And our understanding of the Japanese nation's historical spirit of struggle is to use history to prove that Japan will definitely be able to persevere to the end. This is one point. Second, trust the accuracy of the theory of Japan's coexistence and co-prosperity; third, the strategy of persevering to the end will surely lead to victory.</p>
<p>History is the most truthful proof. Every crisis in Japan's two thousand six hundred years of history is sufficient to prove the spirit of struggle of the Japanese nation. Emperor Jimmu's accession to the throne in Kashihara after eight years of hard struggle is a historical example of the Japanese nation's perseverance. It is even more evident today. The heroic deaths of all officials and civilians on Saipan and Tinian, as well as the Kamikaze spirit, are all current facts that prove that when the survival of the Japanese nation is threatened, the Japanese nation's unwillingness to yield is not just propaganda. And Grew, who knows Japan well, cannot but admit that "the reason why the American army suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Iwo Jima was the result of the Japanese army's struggle."</p>
<p>The strategic weakness of the enemy, America, lies in "attempting to defeat Japan in one go." If Japan adopts a strategy of persevering to the end, taking advantage of their internal weakness of not being able to last, then the enemy, America, must fight on the islands of the Pacific, on the Japanese mainland, and on the Chinese mainland. In this way, the outcome of the war, to whom victory belongs, we can easily imagine.</p>
<p>The current situation is so urgent, and the future prospects are so grand. Our country is a member of the Greater East Asia War, and we should further understand and strive.</p>
<p>Suburban Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Focus of Attention: The Rice Market in Zhoujiaqiao</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>Zhoujiaqiao is a place name in western Shanghai. Because it is a concentration point for the sale of rice and grain, it has received special attention from Shanghai citizens in recent years. The reporter hired a car and went there at seven o'clock yesterday morning. After passing Jing'an Temple Road and turning into YuYue Road, passing Zhongshan Park brought a rural atmosphere. The houses along the road were all low tile houses. Some old women, young girls, middle-aged men, and children of twelve or thirteen years old were carrying bags of rice in a continuous stream towards the east. The more westward we went, the more people there were. This was telling us that we were approaching the rice market – Zhoujiaqiao.</p>
<p>After passing the West Station (Fanwangdu Road Station), we could only see a mass of heads moving around. On both sides of Bailinan Road, there were bags and bags of rice on display. Behind them stood the owners of these rice. Surrounding them were many customers from the city carrying empty burlap bags. Some of them were users, and some were rice merchants. They were judging the quality of the rice, arguing about the price, and calculating the weight, creating a noisy scene. More than one-third of the shops on both sides of the road were rice and grain shops.</p>
<p>Zhoujiaqiao itself does not produce rice. Now it is just a distribution center for rice and grain. The rice and grain here are entirely transported from Huangdu via Beixinjing, either by waterway from Suzhou or by land along the highway. The price of rice in Huangdu is now only 40,000 yuan, but because of the Qingxiang blockade and other obstacles, it is not easy to transport it over. Therefore, the price difference over a distance of only sixty miles is huge, which is truly unbelievable. Most of the rice in Huangdu is imported from Suzhou and Wuxi. A few days ago, the price of rice in Suzhou and Wuxi was only 25,000 yuan per stone. Recently, it has only been able to rise to 30,000 yuan per stone due to the reverse influence of Shanghai. This phenomenon of different prices in different places is somewhat unreasonable.</p>
<p>The price of rice in Zhoujiaqiao is of great concern to all Shanghai citizens. Yesterday, the price of Bo Dao (early rice) in that area was 93,000 yuan to 95,000 yuan per stone, Huang Bo Dao (yellow early rice) was 88,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan per stone, and Yang Zhi (foreign rice) was 90,000 yuan per stone. It was only cheaper than the price in the urban area by the cartage fee of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per stone. This is because the rice and grain that arrive in Zhoujiaqiao have already completed layers of checkpoints and have also used up various kinds of expenses. After arriving in Zhoujiaqiao, no further fees are required. Therefore, if someone who is not familiar with this situation takes a rickshaw from the city center to Zhoujiaqiao to buy rice and then transports it back by rickshaw, the calculation may sometimes be more expensive than buying rice from the rice merchants at the entrance of the alley. Since this is a distribution center for rice, there is also a large distribution of rice straw here. In the Suzhou River here, there are large boats and boats of rice straw, as many as two or three hundred. These rice straws are all supplied to bathhouses. Since the source of coal has become scarce, rice straw has become a very common substitute in bathhouses. There are now more than twenty firewood shops here, all doing rice straw business. Bean stalks are only a small amount, and as for other fuels such as firewood, there is very little here.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Economic Bureau Plans to Strengthen the Structures of Various Trade Associations; Adjustments Will Be Implemented After the Completion of the Investigation</h3>
<p>In view of the loose organization and unsound structure of various trade associations in the city's industrial and commercial sectors, the Municipal Economic Bureau recognizes that some associations are even organized by industries with similar natures, which often leads to disputes among the trades. Whether the candidates for directors and supervisors of various trade associations are appropriate has a significant impact on the welfare of the industry members and the government's promotion of wartime economic policies. Therefore, the bureau has recently been actively planning to strengthen and adjust the organizational structures of various trade associations throughout the city. For those associations that (1) have unsound internal organizational structures, (2) have inappropriate directors and supervisors, (3) have similar industrial natures, or (4) are hollow inside without actual work, they will be ordered to reorganize and merge, or be banned. It is understood that the bureau's entire plan for reorganizing the trade associations has been largely decided and will soon be implemented. The reorganization steps will first involve sending personnel to conduct a general investigation of the internal organizational system, the qualifications of the directors and supervisors, and the economic situation of various trade associations. After the general investigation is completed, the bureau will, based on the actual business situation, classify them and order them to reorganize or merge, so as to ensure that the internal organizational structures of the trade associations are sound and can effectively shoulder the wartime economic mission of seeking the welfare of the industry.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Venues Evading Taxes; The Finance Bureau Imposes Severe Penalties; Including Ten Establishments Such As Ye Lai Xiang</h3>

The Tianchan Stage was fined 2,243,357.15 yuan for failing to tear off the ticket stubs. The Tiangong Yue Opera Theater was fined 145,500 yuan for not stamping the date on additional seat tickets. The Oriental Bookstore was fined 19,160.04 yuan for failing to send admission tickets to the bureau for stamping. The Xiaoduhui Dance Hall was fined 63,000 yuan for not stamping the date on dance tickets. The Longmen Grand Theater was fined 236,892.90 yuan for not issuing tickets for additional seats. The Jiuxing Grand Theater was fined 980,785 yuan for using one ticket for two purposes. The Shanghai Grand Theater was fined 374,625 yuan for using old silver-light tickets without prior registration. The Gao Le Ge Chang was fined 1,947,816.90 yuan for privately increasing the price of singing tickets. The above establishments have been notified to pay the full amount separately. Those who fail to pay within the deadline will be subject to compulsory enforcement.</p>
<h3>The Police Bureau Held a Bureau Affairs Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau held its seventh bureau affairs meeting at 11:00 am yesterday in the bureau's conference room. The meeting was presided over by Director Zhou himself. Attendees included Director Zhou, Deputy Director Du, Deputy Director Lu, Man Qiwei, Itoshima Shigeru, Li Shiyu, Guo Shaoyi, Tsukazaki Masaaki, Li Jiuchuan, Gu Jiwu, Hiraoka Isamu, Ide Kiyomi, and other division chiefs.

Several important cases, such as standardizing the titles of Chinese, Japanese, and foreign police officers, were successfully passed. Mr. Zhou also gave detailed instructions on the promotion of police administration in the future. The meeting concluded around 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Layoffs: In order to reform the police administration and refresh personnel, so as to enhance the strength of public security, the Municipal Police Bureau has been eliminating redundant staff. The first batch of more than 2,000 people was announced on the 1st. It is understood that the second batch of more than 200 people was also announced yesterday (6th). Among them, there are more than 80 people from various sections and departments of the General Bureau, and more than 100 people from various sub-bureaus, including police inspectors, police sergeants, clerks, police chiefs, and police officers. The laid-off personnel will be given considerable severance pay based on their years of service. In addition, the Supervision Department of the bureau has recently been actively promoting the supervision of police work. Many police officers have been reported for misconduct. Those who violate police regulations will be given disciplinary action of dismissal. Those who violate the law will be handed over to the Third Division for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law in addition to being dismissed. More than 200 police officers were dismissed last month, and several were investigated. Therefore, it is expected that the situation will improve under the strict supervision of the police authorities in the future.</p>
<h3>A Black Hat at the North Station Committed Murder; A Young Woman Was Beaten to Death; The Police Bureau Is Strictly Pursuing the Fugitive</h3>
<p>Xu Peiwen, the wife of Xu Senzhi from Zhenjiang, lived at No. 21, Xinde Xingli, Xinzhang Road, Zhabei District, in this city. Recently, due to the evacuation of the population in Shanghai, she planned to send her mother-in-law and three-year-old daughter back to their original residence in Zhenjiang. On the morning of March 4th, at 2:00 am, she waited at ticket office No. 4 of the North Station until 7:00 am. She was beaten for no reason by Jiang Shiyan, a black hat at the station. Then, he grabbed her hair and dragged her to his office to beat her, causing her to suffer multiple serious injuries. She was sent to the Shanghai Sanatorium on Bazilu Road. Her kidneys were removed and found to be shattered. She died at 1:45 am the next morning. The murderer fled upon hearing the news. After receiving the report, the North Station Sub-bureau immediately sent police to arrest the murderer but failed to do so. They then negotiated with the China Railway Authority to request assistance in the arrest. At the same time, the police bureau sent out a large number of plainclothes detectives to strictly pursue the arrest day and night, determined to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>The Finance Bureau Establishes a Committee for the Collection of Cigarette Consumption Tax</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Luo took office as the director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Finance Bureau, he has spared no effort in rectifying tax collection. Although it has not been long, there has been a significant increase in various donations and taxes. Recently, in view of the fact that the collection mechanism for the special consumption tax on retail cigarette sales in the past was not sound and the collection methods were inconsistent, a Special Committee for the Collection of Special Consumption Tax on Retail Cigarette Sales was specially established. Representatives from the cigarette industry and experienced experts Yu Ai-yu, Jiang Sen-yu, Zhang Da-lian, Yang Bing-yi, Tan Ting-ze, Xu Wen-xiang, Ye Yun-fang, Weng Bing-yao, and Chen Bo-zong were appointed as members to be responsible for handling the collection and payment of the special consumption tax on retail cigarette sales throughout the city, and two specialists from the Finance Bureau were assigned to supervise and promote the work. The committee was established on March 4th of this year at No. 148 Ding'an Road (formerly Route Magbao Lu), and the first committee meeting was held at the same time, passing the organizational charter and other important cases. It is now rushing to complete the relevant procedures. It is heard that it has been stipulated that the special consumption tax on rationed cigarettes will be collected from the 48th period onwards, and the special consumption tax on non-rationed cigarettes will be collected by cigarette factories assisting in the collection.</p>
<h3>The Issuance of Housing Sublease Licenses Is Handled by the Finance Bureau</h3>
<p>The issuance and collection of fees for housing sublease licenses in this city have always been handled by the Finance Bureau. The execution of investigation matters was handled by the Industrial Investigation Office during the former District Public Office period. Now that the Industrial Investigation Office has long been abolished, all housing sublease investigations and executions are under the jurisdiction of the Finance Bureau. If housing disputes arise, which concern the welfare of the people, they can be handled by the Social Welfare Bureau. It is heard that the municipal government has approved this arrangement and ordered the Finance and Social Welfare Bureaus to comply.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Station Sub-bureau Strives to Eliminate the Black Market for Tickets</h3>
<p>Liu Zhenzhong, the director of the Shanghai Station Sub-bureau of the Municipal Police Bureau, believes that although he has tried his best to eliminate black market train tickets, he has not been able to completely fulfill the responsibilities of the sub-bureau. In order to completely eliminate black market tickets, it is heard that he has drafted an overall plan, which is currently being submitted for approval.</p>
<h3>Land Transportation in This City Is Gradually Becoming Smoother</h3>
<p>At a time when the Municipal Government is seeking to disperse the population of this city, smooth transportation is a prerequisite. The reporter specially visited Mr. He, a director of the China Railway Company. According to Mr. He, the company had reduced the number of train services due to fuel issues. Recently, the fuel problem has been resolved. In addition to the scheduled services operating as usual, the overnight express train on the Shanghai-Nanjing line was restored from the previous day. Other long-distance buses under the company's jurisdiction are also operating as usual. Therefore, land transportation in this city has gradually become smoother. The company also bears part of the responsibility for transportation in the dispersal of the city's population. The authorities are actively planning how to disperse the population in the future. As for the situation at the North Station, after repeated efforts with the police authorities, the situation has been improving day by day. However, recently, the number of citizens who have voluntarily evacuated from Shanghai has been quite large, and the overcrowding of passengers has caused the order at the North Station to deteriorate again. Passengers who have purchased tickets but are unable to board the train due to overcrowding can go to the designated location to return the tickets or state their reasons to the station master's office. After the station master stamps the tickets as proof, they can still use the original tickets on the next train.</p>
<p>News on Reading and Helping Students</p>
<h3>The Bureau Adds a Subsidy for Books and Supplies to the Students It Sponsors</h3>
<p>The allocation of student aid this year was based on a comprehensive estimate of the total amount of donations received at the beginning of the school year and the tuition fees charged by various schools. It was felt that the funds were stretched. Therefore, it was decided to limit aid to existing students and not to provide aid to new students. The maximum amount of general aid for students at all levels was set at 5,000 yuan for senior primary school, 8,500 yuan for junior high school, 12,000 yuan for senior high school and vocational schools, and 20,000 yuan for universities. Although this was an increase of 150% to 233% compared to the previous year, it was far less than the increase in tuition fees at various schools. As a result, the students receiving aid were unable to get sufficient assistance, which the colleagues deeply regretted. However, in the past month, readers have been enthusiastically donating, and the proceeds from the charity market jointly organized by the four groups and the charity performance organized by the recipients of the newspaper's aid were also higher than expected. In order to give new students the opportunity to receive aid, the Charity Market Committee proposed to allocate more than 5 million yuan to various schools to subsidize students in need other than those receiving aid from Shen Bao and Xin Bao. The newspaper also decided to allocate a certain percentage of the proceeds from the charity performance to the schools with the best ticket sales to do the same. Both of these measures are to remedy the situation of not accepting new students this year. In addition, the Student Aid Committee of this newspaper, in order to remedy the shortcoming that the amount of aid could not be increased due to the limitation of donations, plans to re-allocate and subsidize the donations received in the past month. It was immediately resolved to add a subsidy for books and supplies to the students receiving aid, as follows:</p>
<p>1,500 yuan per student for senior primary school,</p>
<p>2,500 yuan per student for junior high school,</p>
<p>4,000 yuan per student for senior high school and vocational schools,</p>
<p>5,000 yuan per student for universities.</p>
<p>The distribution date and procedures will be announced separately, and it is planned to distribute all the funds before the end of this month. The committee also decided to entrust a hospital with the remaining funds to handle medical treatment subsidies for students receiving aid. Detailed measures will be announced later. From April onwards, the committee will resume the morning exercises of the students receiving aid. The readers have continued to donate enthusiastically after the start of the school year. The members of the committee, in view of the impoverished situation of the students, decided to allocate as much of the deposits as possible to the students, hoping that the students will work harder in their studies in the future and not betray the enthusiasm of the readers and the hard work of the colleagues of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Aid Received: A group of colleagues from Shanghai Jian donated 30,000 yuan, Cheng Zhaoying (on behalf of the landlord Mr. Song) donated 25,000 yuan, and Shi Kou donated 400 yuan. A total of 55,400 yuan was received, with a balance of 9,728,953.03 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Education and Police Bureaus Thoroughly Investigate the Black Market for Textbooks</h3>
<p>The government provides nationally designated textbooks for various subjects used in primary and secondary schools in this city at stipulated prices for widespread distribution through various bookstores in order to popularize education and reduce the burden on students' parents. However, there are still a few unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate on nationally designated textbooks and sell them at black market prices. Therefore, there has been a great shortage of nationally designated textbooks in this city recently. In order to combat these black market prices, the Education Bureau has secretly dispatched staff members to conduct secret investigations in conjunction with detectives from the Police Bureau at various bookstores in this city. It has been found that Shen Jiliang of Shanhe Bookstore on Yandang Road was selling nationally designated textbooks at 40% above the original price. He has now been sent to the court by the Police Bureau for strict handling in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Funds Depleted, Difficult to Maintain - Red Cross Third Hospital Fundraising - Goal 10,000,000 Yuan, Entrusted to Xin Shen and Shen Bao Newspapers for Collection</h3>
<p>Dating back to the Second Revolution in the second year of the Republic (1913), the Red Cross established this hospital outside the 16th Pier on Wai Ma Road to treat wounded soldiers, initially known as the Fifth Wounded Soldiers Hospital, marking the hospital's beginning. Subsequently, during various wars, this hospital repeatedly undertook the task of rescuing wounded soldiers, while also serving the general public during peacetime. The Red Cross had already established the First and Second Hospitals, and this hospital was accordingly named the Third Hospital. The hospital's purpose has always been rooted in charity, therefore fees are particularly low, and often free. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), it moved to No. 1750 Xinzha Road (Jiaozhou Road intersection), expanding in scale. Statistics show that outpatient visits are approximately 40,000 people per year, and inpatient admissions are approximately 3,000 to 4,000 people. Currently, there are 10 doctors, 25 nurses, 15 staff members, and 28 laborers, totaling 86 people, with 120 beds. In terms of medical services, it is divided into internal medicine, surgery, pulmonology, obstetrics, otolaryngology, and X-ray equipment. As for the hospital's finances, it previously received subsidies from the head office, but the head office ceased operations long ago, leaving the hospital to rely solely on its own resources. However, in recent years, prices have been rising, expenses are enormous, and the hospital has never solicited donations from the outside world, resulting in increasing losses. Since the autumn of last year, prices have risen even more sharply, especially for Western medicine and rice. The hospital needs approximately one shi, two or three dou of rice every day, which is already a considerable expense. Recently, the monthly loss has been 1,300,000 to 1,400,000 Yuan. Arrangements are made everywhere, but it is difficult to cope with the situation. To date, the debt has reached more than 4,000,000 Yuan, and it is difficult to guarantee that prices will not rise in the future, making it even more difficult to cope with the future environment. Therefore, we have no choice but to appeal to all sectors of society for a public donation of 10,000,000 Yuan, and we have separately requested the Xinwen Bao and Shen Bao social service departments to collect donations on our behalf. We sincerely hope that great philanthropists will generously donate to enable this hospital to continue to serve society, directly helping the hospital, which indirectly helps the poor and sick. (The editorial office notes that the Red Cross Third Hospital is well-managed, charges low fees, provides convenience for the poor and sick, and serves the public interest, which is truly worthy of sympathy. Now that the hospital is publicly raising funds and has entrusted this office to collect donations on its behalf, please send your donations to this office.)</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Individuals - Savings for Charity</h3>
