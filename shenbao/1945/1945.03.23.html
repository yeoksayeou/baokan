<h3>日小磯首相廣播演說　朂國民奮起決戰　唯勝利始克打開國難之途</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日小磯首相二十一日下午七時二十分廣播，題爲打開國難之途，略謂：硫黃島之失陷，確爲大東亞戰局之一大轉機，實爲盞人痛恨萬分者，有悠久燦爛歷史之大日本帝國一隅，已遭敵軍恣意蹂躪，該島雖爲不毛之一小島，但亦令人引起外侮內侵之感慨。昔於元軍之國難中，壹岐。對馬兩地，一度歸於敵手，但終獲勝利，今硫黃島之失守，亦同樣爲大東亞戰爭最後勝利之前提。由於該島之失陷，吾人之必勝信念益形堅定，戰事逐漸延及本土，敵軍企岡於本土登陸，吾人身處於此，體騐過去，則預料今後戰局益趨熾烈，然吾人於此環境下獲得此種戰果，實深慶幸，皇國日本際此國家興亡，大和民族存續之秋，唯有勝利始克挽回，國民諸君速起集中全力，完成戰爭目的。</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日陸軍次官柴山氏，二十一日下午於衆院軍事特別措置法委員會席上，答覆宮崎一氏之質疑，申述準備在洋面與水域擊滅敵軍，略謂：軍若企圖對本土進攻，我必集中全力，於海上一舉擊滅之。敵軍若於本土登陸時，則發揮龐大之兵力，於沿岸擊滅之。吾人深信此種方法爲最完善，故於本法案中提出。</p>
<h3>日大本營昨發表　撃傷敵戰艦一艘　殘存敵空母七艘已東逃</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日大本營二十二日下午三時三十分發表：二二十一日攻擊敵機動部隊之戰果中，現已判明者如决：擊傷戰艦一艘。</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　敵將尼米資就十八。十九兩日美國艦載機空襲日本·九州·四國·中國等地之舉，荒唐無稽，大肆宣揚，然日方損害極爲輕微，敵美機動部隊於二十日開始遁往南方海域，日航空特攻隊及轟炸機隊，二十一日晨至傍晚連續猛攻，第一次重創其戰艦一艘，洋面起大火柱二條，此誠爲敵艦沉沒之兆，其外特攻隊十一架衝撞轟炸機，亦侖中炸彈三枚，其戰果迄未判明。二十一日傍晚，敵機動部隊開足速率，由硫球東方海上往東逃走，據日軍偵察之結果，其中心勢力航空母艦僅爲七艘，其沉失或受傷者至少爲七艘或九艘，由於二十一夜間之攻擊，敵機動部隊受損至大，其殘存勢力僅爲原夾之一半。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電敵機動部隊自十八日起歷二日間，受日空軍之猛攻以來，其殘部因不能支持，乃如漏網之魚，狼狽鼠竄逃去，按諸事實，可知此次敵機動部隊之主力，當爲第五十八機動鄧隊無疑，然經此鏖戰後，可知其咽喉已爲日空軍予以扼制矣。</p>
<h3>滿中山公使談使命與精神</h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電滿洲國新任駐華公使中山優氏，二十二日下午三時在大使館接見首都中外記者，就滿洲國之使命及滿洲建國精神等闡述甚詳，茲誌大要如下：滿洲國使命，在促進中日提携關係，唯一的途徑，即在將滿洲的建國精神，徹底普及到中日兩國國民的心中。此次本人來華，亟願以一個滿洲國民的資格，與中國人士相處，使中國故友能瞭解我個人思想與態度，進而理解滿洲的建國精神，爲中國靑年們所不了解，本人願在此地的略說明。回憶日俄戰爭的時候，日本的獲勝，可設是有機會性的，當時日本爲衛護自身，將如何與西歐勢力周旋，實是一個最大而最難的問題，日本國人口與物資缺乏，不得不於大陸方面覓一基地，反觀中國的人力物資均極豐富，無力的日本，唯有請中國協助，所以如此中日滿各國所遇的危機，均可消滅，整個東亞安全，也可保了。然那時中國內亂方熾，而眼光淺舊，允未能深諒日本，所似滿洲事變發生了。滿洲的建國，可視爲一種地方革命，是當地人以自己力量所建樹的滿洲，有漢人，有日本人，有其他各民族，各氏族間彼此協和，從事建國事業，更欲將這種精神擴而大之，調和中日關係，聯繫一體，這便是滿洲國建國精神。硫黃島戰事殊可痛心，今後第二第三炙的硫島事件，要繼續而來，亦未可知，此次戰事，允甚于前决，所以將來的勝利，果屬於誰，很難預言。</p>
<h3>日情報局發表勤勞動員案</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日政府鑒於決戰下勤勞動員之重要性，二十一日於臨時閣議中決定戰期內之動勞動員實施案，二十二日由情報局發表如决：政府爲應付戰局之嚴重，在防備防空諸設施之建設，食糧之增產，兵器之生產及運輸等部門之增强，今後將全體總動員予以調整，以期迅速澈底實現。</p>
<h3>聯銀發行五百元券</h3>
<p>北平二十二日中央社電　中國聯合準備銀行爲調劑籌碼，特將新印之五百元券及十元券，自二十三日起流用市面。</p>
<p>實部准許商民自由運輸煤觔</p>
<p>南京二十二中央社電　實業部頃對燃料供應情形談述如下：本部爲謀煤觔之增產及來源之疏通，已擬具辦法，不日即可付諸實施。除上項辦法外，並與有關方面商定，准許商民自由運輸淮南煤礦公司存煤，以應需要，運輸方法，由商民自由申請運輸，但須擬具運輸計劃，俾便與有關各方聯絡，其價格以出產地適當價格爲標準，經商民運出，得全部自由販賣，現該部正策動有力商民從事運輸，今後煤觔來源諒可好轉。</p>
<h3>戰時民衆會議　二次籌備會</h3>
<p>南京二十二中央社電　各省市戰時民衆代表會議籌備處，二十二日下午四時，在國民大會堂舉行第二次籌備會議，出席全體籌備委員及各組幹事，討論該處各組應行籌備事宜，極爲縝密，迄大時許散會。</p>
<h3>東埔寨王國閣僚已決定</h3>
<p>金邊二十二日中央社電　東埔寨王國政府，自十三日宣言獨立以來，即愼重協議新內閣之人事機構，二十日已正式任命，經濟大臣諸羅頓莫德納（留任），敎育宣傳大臣美斯納爾（留任），國防食糧大臣迭亞森（前內政大臣），司法大臣江那克（留任），司政大臣斯姆濱，宗敎藝術儀典大臣伐加美爾（新任），又總理大臣尚未發表。</p>
<h3>美大潛艇一艘在太平洋沉沒</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　華盛頓電，美海軍部二十一日發表稱：美潛艇柏培爾號（一五二五噸），在太平洋海面哨戒，迄今未返，確認其已沉沒。</p>
<h3>太平洋美艦隊實力已銳減</h3>
<p>中央社訊　關於敵美太平洋艦隊之編成第三，第五，第七，第九之四艦隊，以三，五兩艦隊爲最雄厚，此乃舉世週知者，敵美以該兩艦隊爲中心，再將其他二艦隊作爲增援補助之用。過去敵美第五十八機動部隊及第三十八機動部隊之編成，作爲對日攻擊之主力，唯自中太平洋及西方移動後，艦載機裝置二千五百架，在台灣海面及菲島海面上，已蒙受重大打撃，哈爾賽司令長官所率之第三艦隊於受打擊後，巳不能使用成立艦隊名義，故在過去一月中，在關島已將第三艦隊權務交與史波羅盎斯所率之第五艦隊管理，本身則潛返華盛頓，所謂敵美之第五艦隊，我人在事實上觀測已完全消滅。而美國在二月十六日舉其所有之太平洋艦隊全力，出動於東京近海，並協助琉黃島登陸作戰，其艦載機總數有一千二百架之多，在三月一日，又出擊硫球近海時，艦載機的有八百架，事實上測定僅四五百架。關於此次出擊之敵機動部隊性格，有種種之預測，茲根據尼米資司令部所發表，該機動部隊總指揮官史波羅盎斯，航空母艦部隊指揮官米契爾，在我人觀測，此亦太平艦隊之主力，然敵美太平洋艦隊自台灣海面以前予以比較，從將二千五百架飛機逐漸減少到一千二百架，八百架以及四五百架，敵美之直綫銳減其戰力，其情形常頗爲明瞭。尤其在我人計算，以前總計五分，今則銳跌爲五分之一，其情景當更可瞭如指掌。在該次中，給予敵人之打擊頗重，計將敵正規航空母艦擊沉二艘，擊沉空母或戰艦一艘，戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘及艦型不詳者二艘，而所擊破之正規空母二艘，擊隊其飛機一百八十三架，撃破焚燒各一，同時足見正規空母四艘被擊破沉，故此次敵美機動部隊之戰力降底不少。我人判斷日軍之戰果，已將敵擊碎三分之一，故敵在太平洋艦隊，實爲極大之打擊，此乃極爲明瞭，雖然敵美輿論機關恒鼓吹狂呼向日本土登陸，或接近中國沿岸等等，我人今觀測敵戰力，在作戰上，已深感困難，而在日本方面，則所希望者。</p>
<h3>最近國際情勢展望（二）　——松平部長廣播演說詞——</h3>
<p>英美兩國的對立傾向，使最近東亞的國際情勢，激起微妙的波瀾。至其原因，爲英國對於美國的「旁若無人」的態度之不滿。舉一具體事實來看，最初的問題是這樣的，美國對英國的印度政策，加以責難，美國派遣特使斐里浦斯赴印研究英國的政策，得到「英國應立即使印度獨立」的結論，向美國政府提出，英國對此認爲美國多管閒事，兩國感情乃日趨惡劣，斐里浦斯即從印度逃回本國。</p>
<p>其次是因香港及九龍半島問題，英美意見相左，美國主張交還中國，但英國以爲交還不交還由彼自由決定，不容美國多事。最近還有一件趣事，就是美國太平洋艦隊司令尼米茲與英國太平洋艦隊司令弗拉西的鬧翻，弗拉西要求使英國艦隊參加作戰，然尼米茲則加拒絕，謂英國艦隊速力旣慢，軍艦又老式，還是在旁看看熱鬧吧！英國報紙於是不甘示弱，在報端越稱「此何言也，海軍的本家也是英國呢！」總之，表面上看起來最要好的伙伴，時時發生類似這樣的對立。</p>
<p>在歐洲的英美蘇</p>
<p>歐洲方面如何呢？因爲利害關係錯綜，所以情勢亦極複雜，其根本原因在於英蘇不能一致，而美國站在調停的地位。蘇聯對於　國芬蘭·巴爾幹三國·波蘭·及羅馬呢亞等，採取其單獨政策，不容他人踏入一步，他的方針並且還逐步擴展到保加利亞。又對於其他國家，或採取插足主義派共產黨員等充任閣僚，或與特戈爾表示友好，企圖伸張其勢力。</p>
<p>應付此種環境，英國乃將士耳其，荷蘭置於自己勢力下，對於希臘亦出動軍隊進駐，對於南斯拉夫正焦急企圖置於勢力範圍下，並歡迎法蘭西當作友人。可以見其欲過止蘇聯勢力在歐洲大陸擴張的苦心。</p>
<p>此種英蘇間的摩擦，在波蘭在南斯拉夫·希臘·義大利波諾米政權以及法國等均可處處看出，但受到戰禍的歐洲各地，到處發生經濟凋疲，糧食恐慌，從客觀的情勢來看，已成了共產主義的溫床，英國現在亦明知此等政治問題如不能收拾，則將影響及戰爭。</p>
<p>在德黑蘭會談中，他們商定戰爭第一主義，政治問題留在戰後再解決，但無論如何，將來勢必成爲問題。美英憂心蘇聯步步造成旣成事實，所以此次克里米亞會談中，英美蘇三國最高責任者曾進行商議，</p>
<p>克里米亞會談自二月四日起迄十一日止，前後八天，在克里米亞半島雅爾達舉行·羅斯福·邱吉爾·史太林各率同軍事外交幕僚出席，他們所決定的大致有以下數端：（一）對德作戰計劃；（二）使德國無條件屈服並令其賠償損失；（三）根據鄧巴頓奧克斯決定，促進組織和平機構，並召開聯合國會議；（四）具體實現歐洲小國之民主主義，並重新確認大西洋憲章；（五）建立波蘭新政府；（六）促推南斯拉夫由蒂多與歇巴希基合作建立政府；（七）定期召開三國外長會議。以上爲此次會談的結果，但在會談之前，羅斯福派特別顧問霍浦金斯渡歐，歷在倫敦·巴黎·羅馬遊說美國方面的能度，俾使會談能得順利進行，於此可見會談經過長時期折衝的困難。史太林於會談後似立即返國，但羅斯應與邱吉爾在返國途中再度在亞歷山大港舉行會談，僅經四小時草草而終，所談內容是對日作戰，聞英國主張對德戰爭吿一段落後，再傾全力應付對日作戰。</p>
<p>又羅斯福曾在所乘之巡洋艦，泊於蘇彝士運河，接見埃及，阿比西尼亞，沙地阿刺伯等三國國王，邱吉爾亦先後會見此三國國王及叙利亞大總統，就軍事政治上作重要會談。羅斯福並派國務决官赴莫斯科，並命渠繞道至墨西哥出席汎美會議，羅斯福本人則邀特戈爾至埃及會見，但遭特戈爾婉言拒絕，於此可見法國對於三國會談不感興趣。在克里米亞會談中，據說另有秘密諒解事項商定，三月一日以前不對軸心國宣戰者一律不得出席舊金山國際安全保障會議，此恐係秘密諒解事項之一，故南美六國即起響應宣戰，近東之土耳其，埃及，叙利亞，黎巴嫩等，當在羅邱與各該團　國王及總統會談時已被强迫決定。（未完）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>社會先於個人</h3>
<p>周市長接事的時候，曾發表告上海市民書，中間提到「公益重於私利，社會先於個人」兩句話。我們爲了申引這兩句話的意義，同時，喚起上海一般人尤其是社會有力份子重視這兩句話的意義，會不脈煩瑣三次申論（見二月七日八日及三月六日社評）。我們所以屢决指陳者，因爲目前上海社會上，只顧私利不顧公益，只有個人沒有社會的現象太普遍化了。如果不加變革，社會腐化以至崩潰，可以斷言。我們不願意坐視社會腐化崩潰，不能不痛陳利害，以爲一般人箴告。</p>
<p>只顧私利，不顧公益的現象，最顯著暴露的，就在：私利之事，大家趨之若鶩，爭先唯恐不及；公益之事，大家避之若凂，推諉唯恐不力。試從最近數事以觀，益可充分騐證。一件是平價米事，當接洽採辦平價米之初，平價與黑市米價相差無幾，雖經分派工商各界，猶意存觀望，不感興趣，迨至限期交款，仍屬　趄不前。其後，米價黑市暴漲，與平價相差極鉅，於是向之消極態度轉爲積極，而爭購要求之事接踵而起。前後態度所以不同者，就在於私利之心的轉移。一件是軍警贈金與冬賑經費事，完全爲公益之事，在狹義的觀點，確然毫無私利的。因此，雖經工商各業公會分別攤認，不是託詞就是延宕。</p>
<p>最近市府發行救濟庫券十五萬萬元，其中五萬萬元指定各業公會分等承募。這又是完全公益的事。傳聞因爲社會公益之事陸續推進，工商同業公會感覺負担重重，因而有些會員退會，有些公會的負責人辭職，如果退會與辭職爲了對內關係，可不置論，如果動機由於規避公益負担，則社會輿論決不能放棄批評。而實際上公會會員退會，法令上亦有限制，公會負責人辭退，仍爲業中一員，仍爲上海市民，公益事業依然無可推諉。過去租界時代，在英美人保護之下，固可逃避，目前時代環境完全不同，公益之事，旣不能逃避，亦不容討價還價，這是應該認議淸楚的。</p>
<p>市府救濟庫券十五萬寓元，其中十萬萬元作爲彌補過去配給米差額之用，這是有關全市市民公益的。五萬萬元作爲臨時救濟經費，也是關係市民公益的。在政府方面，我們當然期待取之於市民者，用之於市民，而在工商業公會方面，各會員經營營利，也可以說取之於大衆，則爲大衆公益而盡些義務，自亦理所應爲。即就分等攤認的數量，以與各業公會的會員實際力量相衡，實在綽有餘裕，如果大家稍稍顧到公益，如數籌集，決非難事。所以，我們希望各業公會的負責人士，深明大義，重視公益，曉諭同業會員，並以身作則，爲同業樹立模楷。例如我們新聞同業，中國方面祗有六家，且不在公會範圍之內，可是，我們首先担任六百萬元，論各報經濟能力，是極感困難的，可是，因爲是公益，就有負担的義務，不能不勉爲其難</p>
<p>我們說過：「上海興亡，上海人有責」，尤其是各業各界的領導人士，責任更大，只有本着「公益重於私利，社會先於個人一的態度，積極爲公益打算，必先共同克服上海社會的危機，然後才能保持個人的利益。</p>
<h3>西綫方面決戰迫眉睫</h3>

<h3>小學生同情失學　向親友勸募「義學金」</h3>
<p>這幾天承蒙讀者對於「義學金」，熱烈贊助，我們非常感動。不過，就贊助者的範圍而言，偏於學生方面尤其小學生苦學生們，誠是「同病相憐」，益見親切，爲什麼其餘較有力量的讀者諸君，反而不見贊助呢？我們對此問題，細加思考，認爲有力量的有經騐的讀者的意見，也許以爲此事體大，責任艱互，不易辦好，所以，暫取觀望。我們並不否認這種意見，我們也願以全力做去，以做到的成果博取大衆的贊助。昨天復有幾位純潔的小朋友來信，表示熱心與熱望。</p>
<p>（一）本報助學金受助的六個學生爲響應本處「義學金」來函云：「我們六個人都是實報助學金生，要是沒有助學金的帮助，大家都失學了，一方面謝謝貴報，一方面謝謝千萬讀者的栽培。最近看到貴報上登着創辦義務小學十所，和發動「義學金」的消息，我門非常感動。而我們的力量，是有限的，錢出錢」「有力出力」的宗旨，向親友們竭力勸募，湊合起來，計中儲券二千元，作爲「義學金」。</p>
<p>我們更希望慈善家，再來一次「義學金」的捐款運動，來帮助一羣可憐失學的孩子們！仍像我們一樣有求學的機會。更盼望受貴報助學金的學生，也像我們一樣，一致向親友勸募。」</p>
<p>（二）四個小朋友何杏弟·於靜娟·徐麗娟·黃金珠來函說：「我們四個人，很有義氣的，可是我們想把幾個人的義氣，推廣開來。今天看到貴報發起「義學金」，救濟失學兒童，這是一件很有義氣的工作，我們應該響應牠，現在把平日積蓄的錢，湊擺來，共計陸任元正，請收入「義學金」捐款。以後等再積下後，再行送上。」</p>
<p>（三）一個小學生程金龍來函說：「我是一個無憂慮的小學生，可是看到貴報發起「義學金」的事，很是感動，因爲沒有書讀的小朋友是多麼痛苦啊！我自己雖然沒有什麼錢，可是我可以去請別人出錢。現在向友人侯元龍君捐到中儲券二千五百元，請收人「義學金」項下。還請在報上登出來，以昭徵信。」</p>

<h3>敵美次期作戰　將陷混亂狀態　松島部長談歐亞戰局</h3>
<p>盟邦日本艦隊報道部報道常會，於昨日下午舉行。到松島部長，松本大尉，及各報記者多人。首由松島部長報吿太平洋戰局，最近美海軍之損失情形，次對歐洲歐局亦有所關述。演詞大要錄後；</p>
<p>太平洋戰局　最近美海軍機動部隊，在九洲四國南方海面遭受重大損害，航空母艦損失三分之一以上，戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦及艦載機均受重大損害，現正向退南方却中。日本航空隊對敗退之敵，正予以追擊。敵人宣傳進擊日本灣戶內海之艦隊，謂日方受有相當損失，而日方則並未接此報吿，揣測其用意，無非藉此掩飾其目身之損失。敵人大胆接近日本近海，欲與日艦隊決戰，結果因對日航空兵力估計錯誤，受猛烈打擊，大敗退却。當十八·十九兩日，海面天氣殊惡，致日方未能將敵人完全殲滅，但至少已予敵人企圖以極大挫折。敵方航空母艦羣之軍需，受到重大打擊，喪亡人數在一萬以上，據美國發表，三月一日一有新式之航空母艦一艘，名「中途」者下水，計四萬四千噸，此爲美人宣傳之慣技，堪爲其作戰遭受損失之解說也。美軍損失如是其鉅，其下期作戰，勢將陷於非常混亂，甚爲明瞭，故不論敵人從何方進擊，結果必受極大損失</p>
<p>硫黃島戰況　日軍在硫黃島之壯烈行動，驚鬼神而動天地。在過去一月間，日軍以極少數兵力，所獲得之戰果爲歷史上空前未有之收獲。敵人登陸之海兵隊，損失過半，至少在八成以上，敵人今後如計擬在日本本土登陸，此例即可作爲作戰之前奏曲視之也。日軍根據戰略，爲整備決戰兵力計，乃不能不暫時放棄此島，深信不久之將來，此島上勇士之英靈，即可獲得相當之安慰。</p>
<p>敵方决期行動如何，我人雖不能預料，但在最近期間，定將有所活動。據最近情勢視之，敵人之活動，與其謂爲接近大陸，反不如謂爲對日本本十爲大。大陸方面之敵空軍，最近行動並不積極，是吾爲整備下期作戰，暫時無從臆斷，但以菲島之戰局推論，英美軍從民答那峨向婆羅洲及越南一帶而來之可能性甚多。總之，無論如何，敵人一旦接近大陸，對中國民衆，勢必出以殘忍虐待，故我人必須極力阻止其在大陸登陸也。</p>
<p>歐洲戰部　東綫蘇軍對德但澤港之包圍戰，大體已完成。蘇軍互哥夫所率之七十個師團，由斯德丁，弗蘭克福對柏林已形成進擊態勢，此七十個師團之兵力，較之西綫美軍蒙高茂萊所統率之六十個師團爲强，故對英美實爲一大威脅。柯尼夫所率之第一烏克蘭軍，在南方俾士羅向西進擊，爲之援助，但沃特河附近之德軍，作戰異常奮勇，致蘇軍進撃，至爲不易。南方斯洛伐克山岳地帶德軍現方緊守陣地，阻止功軍進攻。布克雷斯之蘇威林古軍與德軍展開激戰，尤其爲帕勞頓河之役最爲激烈。萊因河西岸地帶，現爲聯合軍所操縱，但西岸德軍仍繼續其有計劇之活動。北面加拿大軍與美第一軍向惠塞攻擊，迄無進展，其南之美第三第七兩軍亦以激烈之態勢進擊，在此戰役中，聯合軍渡過萊因河，進據克恩·布洪·及萊摩根地帶時，均擴大其橋頭堡，力量殊爲堅厚。南方山岳戰事雖甚激烈，但德軍利用天險，正在堅强抵禦中。美軍最近又在北錢增加第十五軍，擬一鼓作氣，跨越平原，向柏林進攻。德軍倫台特元帥洞燭一切，刻正阻遏其進攻。我人對德軍與其民衆爲生死作奮勇之戰，實表示萬分敬意，並祈禱其勝利成功。又最近德軍潛水艇在波羅的海及北海間甚爲活躍，且獲得相當成功，此亦堪爲我人所崇揚者也</p>
<h3>中國保健協會　普及防癆檢查　半費檢查證由本處代售</h3>
<p>無病本是人生福，有病方知健是仙，在大都市間向以肺病傳染最廣，據最近統計，肺癆蔓延突破以前紀錄，影響公共健康至鉅。現本市舉行防癆週，擴大宣傳，實含重大意義。靜安寺路九九六號中國保健協會爲推進防癆工作，舉行半費X光驗查，藉資普及診斷及早期治療，達到節的醫藥目的，現代醫學進步，已從治療疾病轉爲預防疾病，而以防癆爲最有效益。</p>
<p>症狀　發熱清瘦，咳嗽失眠，盜汗倦怠診斷，現代以X光檢查，最爲簡易確實。</p>
<p>統計　根據最近新聞報搞癆貸金統計，職工患者竟達百分之二十以上，年齡多爲二十至三十歲之青年人，堪稱嚴重問題。</p>
<p>檢查辦法　防癆X光檢查證每紙均滅半收費爲七百元，由本處代售（自即日起至本月底止）。</p>
<p>肺癆爲慢性傳染病，造成社會家庭間種種窮困悲慘之結果，不知凡幾，謂爲種族疾病，亦不爲過。希望各個單位之領袖，如家長校長店主各公司商店經理，各盡厥責，對其所屬儘量提倡實施檢查，愈普遍，則社會愈臻安全</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Koiso's Radio Address: Urging the People to Rise Up and Fight to the End, Only Victory Can Open the Way Out of the National Crisis</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Koiso gave a radio address at 7:20 PM on the 21st, entitled "Opening the Way Out of the National Crisis," stating: "The fall of Iwo Jima is indeed a major turning point in the Greater East Asia War. It is something that fills people with the utmost hatred. A corner of the great Japanese Empire, with its long and glorious history, has been subjected to the enemy's wanton ravaging. Although the island is a barren islet, it still evokes a sense of foreign humiliation and internal invasion. In the national crisis of the Mongol invasions, Iki and Tsushima fell into enemy hands for a time, but we ultimately achieved victory. Similarly, the loss of Iwo Jima is a prerequisite for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Due to the fall of the island, our belief in certain victory is even more steadfast. As the war gradually extends to the homeland, and the enemy attempts to land on our shores, we, standing in this situation and experiencing the past, anticipate that the future war situation will become even more fierce. However, we are deeply fortunate to have achieved this kind of outcome under these circumstances. At this critical juncture for the rise and fall of the Imperial Country of Japan and the survival of the Yamato race, only victory can save us. Citizens, arise quickly, concentrate all your efforts, and accomplish the war's objectives."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Vice Minister of the Army, Mr. Shibayama, stated on the 21st in response to a question from Mr. Miyazaki Ichiro at the Special Military Measures Law Committee of the House of Representatives, that preparations were being made to annihilate the enemy in the ocean and waters, stating: "If the enemy attempts to attack the homeland, we will concentrate all our efforts to annihilate them at sea in one fell swoop. If the enemy lands on the homeland, we will unleash a massive military force to annihilate them along the coast. We firmly believe that this method is the most perfect, and that is why we have proposed it in this bill."</p>
<h3>Imperial Headquarters Announces Yesterday: One Enemy Battleship Damaged, Seven Remaining Enemy Aircraft Carriers Fled Eastward</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 22nd: "Among the results of the attack on the enemy's mobile unit on the 21st, what has now been confirmed is as follows: one battleship damaged."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Enemy General Nimitz made a ridiculous and exaggerated propaganda regarding the American carrier-based aircraft's air raids on Japan, Kyushu, Shikoku, and the Chugoku regions on the 18th and 19th. However, the damage to the Japanese side was extremely minor. The enemy's American mobile unit began retreating to the southern sea area on the 20th. The Japanese Air Special Attack Force and bomber squadrons launched continuous fierce attacks from morning to evening on the 21st, severely damaging one of their battleships in the first strike, with two pillars of fire rising from the ocean surface. This is a sign of the enemy ship sinking. In addition, 11 special attack aircraft rammed and bombed, and three bombs were dropped in the process. The results have not yet been determined. By the evening of the 21st, the enemy mobile unit had opened up its speed and fled eastward from the sea east of the Ryukyu Islands. According to Japanese reconnaissance, the core force of the aircraft carriers was only seven. The number of those sunk or damaged was at least seven or nine. Due to the attack on the night of the 21st, the enemy mobile unit suffered great damage, and its remaining strength was only half of its original strength.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The enemy mobile unit, which had been under fierce attack by the Japanese Air Force for two days since the 18th, could not sustain itself and fled in a panic like fish escaping a net. According to the facts, it can be seen that the main force of this enemy mobile unit was undoubtedly the 58th Mobile Task Force. However, after this fierce battle, it is clear that its throat has been strangled by the Japanese Air Force.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo Minister Zhongshan Talks About Mission and Spirit</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Mr. Zhongshan Yu, the newly appointed Minister of Manchukuo to China, received Chinese and foreign reporters from the capital at the Embassy at 3:00 PM on the 22nd and elaborated in detail on the mission of Manchukuo and the spirit of Manchukuo's founding. The main points are recorded as follows: The mission of Manchukuo is to promote the relationship between China and Japan. The only way is to thoroughly popularize the spirit of Manchukuo's founding in the hearts of the people of both China and Japan. This time, I am coming to China with the desire to get along with Chinese people as a citizen of Manchukuo, so that old Chinese friends can understand my personal thoughts and attitudes, and further understand the spirit of Manchukuo's founding, which is not understood by Chinese youth. I would like to briefly explain it here. Recalling the time of the Russo-Japanese War, Japan's victory can be said to have been an opportunity. At that time, Japan was guarding itself, and how to deal with the Western European forces was the biggest and most difficult problem. Japan lacked population and resources, and had to find a base in mainland China. In contrast, China had extremely abundant manpower and resources. Helpless Japan had no choice but to ask for China's assistance. In this way, the crises encountered by China, Japan, and Manchuria can be eliminated, and the security of the entire East Asia can be guaranteed. However, at that time, China was in the midst of internal strife, and its vision was shallow and old, and it failed to deeply understand Japan. Therefore, the Manchurian Incident occurred. The founding of Manchukuo can be regarded as a kind of local revolution. It was Manchuria built by the local people with their own strength. There are Han people, Japanese people, and other ethnic groups. All ethnic groups and clans cooperate with each other and engage in the founding of the country. Moreover, we want to expand this spirit, harmonize the relationship between China and Japan, and connect them into one. This is the spirit of Manchukuo's founding. The Iwo Jima battle is very painful. In the future, the second and third Iwo Jima incidents may continue to come. This battle is certainly more important than the previous decision. Therefore, it is difficult to predict who the final victory will belong to.</p>
<h3>Japanese Information Bureau Announces Labor Mobilization Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government, in view of the importance of labor mobilization under the decisive battle, decided on the implementation plan for labor mobilization during the war period at the emergency cabinet meeting on the 21st. The Information Bureau announced the decision on the 22nd as follows: In order to cope with the severity of the war situation and to strengthen the construction of defense and air defense facilities, the increase in food production, the production of weapons, and transportation departments, the government will adjust the overall mobilization in the future in order to achieve rapid and thorough implementation.</p>
<h3>United Reserve Bank Issues 500 Yuan Notes</h3>
<p>Peiping, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The China United Reserve Bank has specially printed new 500 yuan and 10 yuan notes to regulate chips, which will be circulated on the market from the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Permits Merchants to Freely Transport Coal</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Industry recently spoke about the fuel supply situation as follows: The Ministry has formulated measures to increase coal production and dredge the source of supply, which will be implemented soon. In addition to the above measures, it has also been agreed with relevant parties to allow merchants to freely transport coal stored by the Huainan Coal Mining Company to meet the needs. The transportation method is that merchants freely apply for transportation, but they must formulate a transportation plan to facilitate contact with all relevant parties. The price is based on the appropriate price at the place of production. Merchants can freely sell all the coal they transport. The Ministry is currently mobilizing powerful merchants to engage in transportation, and the source of coal supply is expected to improve in the future.</p>

<h3>Cabinet Ministers of the Kingdom of Eastern Cambodia Have Been Decided</h3>

The official appointments were made on the 20th: Minister of Economy Chu Luodun Modena (retained), Minister of Education and Propaganda Mei Sinaer (retained), Minister of National Defense and Food Di Yasen (former Minister of the Interior), Minister of Justice Jiang Nake (retained), Minister of Administration Sim Bin, Minister of Religious Arts and Rituals Fa Jiamier (newly appointed), and the Prime Minister has not yet been announced.</p>
<h3>One American Submarine Sinks in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Washington electric message, the US Department of the Navy announced on the 21st: The US submarine Perch (1525 tons) was patrolling in the Pacific Ocean and has not returned to this day, and it has been confirmed that it has sunk.</p>
<h3>Strength of the US Pacific Fleet Has Been Sharply Reduced</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - Regarding the composition of the enemy's US Pacific Fleet, the Third, Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth Fleets, the Third and Fifth Fleets are the most powerful, which is well known to the world. The enemy uses these two fleets as the core, and then uses the other two fleets as reinforcements. In the past, the enemy's 58th Mobile Task Force and 38th Mobile Task Force were formed as the main force for attacking Japan. However, after moving from the central Pacific and the west, the number of carrier-based aircraft installed was 2,500. In the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines, it has suffered major blows. The Third Fleet led by Commander Halsey was unable to use the name of the established fleet after being attacked. Therefore, in the past month, the authority of the Third Fleet in Guam has been handed over to the Fifth Fleet managed by Sporangus, and Halsey himself secretly returned to Washington. The so-called enemy's US Fifth Fleet, we have observed in fact, has been completely eliminated. On February 16, the United States mobilized all the strength of its Pacific Fleet to launch an attack on the sea near Tokyo and assisted in the landing operation on Iwo Jima. The total number of carrier-based aircraft was more than 1,200. On March 1, when it attacked the sea near Ryukyu again, the number of carrier-based aircraft was 800. In fact, the measured number was only 400 or 500. Regarding the characteristics of the enemy mobile unit that launched this attack, there are various predictions. According to the announcement by the Nimitz Command, the commander-in-chief of the mobile unit Sporangus, the commander of the aircraft carrier unit Mitchell, in our observation, this is also the main force of the Pacific Fleet. However, comparing the enemy's US Pacific Fleet since before the sea off Taiwan, the number of aircraft has gradually decreased from 2,500 to 1,200, 800, and 400 or 500. The enemy's straight-line reduction in its combat power is very clear. Especially in our calculations, the total number was five points before, but now it has sharply fallen to one-fifth. The situation should be even clearer. In that operation, the enemy suffered heavy blows. Two enemy regular aircraft carriers were sunk, one aircraft carrier or battleship was sunk, one battleship or cruiser was sunk, two destroyers and two ships of unknown type were sunk. The two regular aircraft carriers that were destroyed had 183 aircraft destroyed, one destroyed and one burned. At the same time, it is evident that four regular aircraft carriers were destroyed and sunk. Therefore, the combat power of this enemy American mobile unit has been greatly reduced. Our judgment is that the Japanese army's combat results have destroyed one-third of the enemy's force. Therefore, the enemy's Pacific Fleet has suffered a huge blow, which is very clear. Although the enemy's American public opinion organs constantly trumpet and shout about landing on the Japanese mainland or approaching the Chinese coast, we now observe that the enemy's combat power is deeply feeling difficult in combat, while on the Japanese side, that is what is hoped for.</p>
<h3>Recent Outlook on the International Situation (II) - Broadcast Speech by Minister Matsudaira -</h3>
<p>The tendency of antagonism between Britain and the United States has stirred up subtle waves in the recent international situation in East Asia. As for the reason, it is Britain's dissatisfaction with the "unruly" attitude of the United States. To give a concrete example, the initial problem was this: the United States criticized Britain's India policy. The United States sent special envoy Phillips to India to study Britain's policy and came to the conclusion that "Britain should immediately grant India independence," which was submitted to the US government. Britain believed that the United States was meddling in its affairs, and the feelings between the two countries deteriorated day by day. Phillips fled back to his country from India.</p>
<p>Secondly, the opinions of Britain and the United States differed on the issue of Hong Kong and the Kowloon Peninsula. The United States advocated returning them to China, but Britain believed that whether to return them or not was its own decision and did not allow the United States to interfere. Recently, there was also an interesting event, that is, the fallout between US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz and British Pacific Fleet Commander Flasier. Flasier demanded that the British fleet participate in the battle, but Nimitz refused, saying that the British fleet was slow and the warships were old-fashioned, so it was better to watch the fun from the sidelines! The British newspapers were not willing to show weakness, and repeatedly said in the newspapers, "What is this? The originator of the Navy is also Britain!" In short, seemingly the best partners on the surface have similar conflicts from time to time.</p>
<p>What about Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Europe?</p>
<p>What about Europe? Because the interests are intertwined, the situation is also extremely complicated. The root cause is that Britain and the Soviet Union cannot agree, and the United States stands in a mediating position. The Soviet Union has adopted its own policy towards the countries of Finland, the three Balkan countries, Poland, and Romania, and does not allow anyone else to step in. His policy is also gradually expanding to Bulgaria. In addition, it has taken measures to insert itself into other countries, such as dispatching communist members to serve as cabinet ministers, or expressing friendship with Tergol, in an attempt to expand its influence.</p>
<p>In response to this environment, Britain placed Turkey and the Netherlands under its own sphere of influence, sent troops to garrison Greece, and was anxiously trying to place Yugoslavia under its sphere of influence, and welcomed France as a friend. It can be seen that it is struggling to prevent the expansion of Soviet power in continental Europe.</p>
<p>This kind of friction between Britain and the Soviet Union can be seen everywhere in Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, the Bono government in Italy, and France, etc. However, in various parts of Europe that have suffered from the war, economic depression and food panic have occurred everywhere. From an objective point of view, it has become a hotbed of communism. Britain is now also aware that if these political problems cannot be resolved, they will affect the war.</p>
<p>At the Tehran Conference, they agreed on the principle of war first, and political issues would be resolved after the war, but in any case, they would inevitably become a problem in the future. The United States and Britain are worried that the Soviet Union is creating a fait accompli step by step. Therefore, at the Crimean Conference, the highest leaders of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, conducted consultations.</p>
<p>The Crimean Conference was held in Yalta, Crimea Peninsula from February 4 to 11, for a total of eight days. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin led military and diplomatic staff to attend. The main points of their decisions are as follows: (1) War plan against Germany; (2) Make Germany surrender unconditionally and compensate for losses; (3) According to the Dumbarton Oaks decision, promote the organization of a peace mechanism and convene a United Nations conference; (4) Concretely realize the democracy of small European countries and reaffirm the Atlantic Charter; (5) Establish a new Polish government; (6) Promote the establishment of a government in Yugoslavia through cooperation between Tito and Shebasic; (7) Regularly convene meetings of the foreign ministers of the three countries. The above is the result of this meeting, but before the meeting, Roosevelt sent special advisor Hopkins to Europe to lobby in London, Paris, and Rome for the US position, so that the meeting could proceed smoothly. This shows the difficulty of the meeting after a long period of negotiation. Stalin seemed to return home immediately after the meeting, but Roosevelt and Churchill held another meeting in Alexandria on their way back home, which ended hastily after only four hours. The content of the discussion was about the war against Japan. It was heard that Britain advocated that after the war against Germany came to an end, it would devote all its efforts to deal with the war against Japan.</p>
<p>Roosevelt also parked the cruiser he was on in the Suez Canal and met with the kings of Egypt, Abyssinia, and Saudi Arabia. Churchill also met with the kings of these three countries and the President of Syria one after another and had important talks on military and political matters. Roosevelt also sent a state official to Moscow and ordered him to detour to Mexico to attend the Pan-American Conference. Roosevelt himself invited Tergol to meet in Egypt, but Tergol politely declined. This shows that France is not interested in the tripartite talks. At the Crimean Conference, it is said that other secret understandings were agreed upon. Those who did not declare war on the Axis powers before March 1 would not be allowed to attend the San Francisco International Security Conference. This may be one of the secret understandings. Therefore, the six South American countries responded by declaring war. The countries of the Near East, such as Turkey, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, were forced to decide when Luo and Qiu met with the kings and presidents of those countries. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Society Before the Individual</h3>
<p>When Mayor Zhou took office, he issued a letter to the citizens of Shanghai, in which he mentioned the two sentences "Public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual." In order to elaborate on the meaning of these two sentences, and at the same time, awaken the general public in Shanghai, especially the influential members of society, to the importance of these two sentences, we will not be annoyed by tedious thrice expositions (see editorials of February 7, February 8, and March 6). The reason why we have repeatedly pointed out the facts is that the phenomenon of only caring about private interests and not caring about public interests, and only having individuals and no society, is too widespread in the current Shanghai society. If it is not changed, the corruption of society will lead to collapse, which can be asserted. We are unwilling to sit idly by and watch society corrupt and collapse, so we cannot but speak frankly about the advantages and disadvantages in order to warn the general public.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of only caring about private interests and not caring about public interests is most conspicuously exposed in: everyone flocks to private affairs, fearing that they will be too late; everyone avoids public affairs like poison, fearing that they will not be able to shirk their responsibilities. Trying to observe from recent events, it can be fully verified. One is the matter of low-priced rice. At the beginning of contacting the purchase of low-priced rice, the price difference between the low-priced rice and the black market rice was almost negligible. Although it was assigned to all sectors of industry and commerce, they still waited and watched, and were not interested. When the deadline for payment arrived, they were still hesitant. Later, the black market price of rice soared, and the difference from the low-priced rice was extremely large. As a result, the previous negative attitude turned into a positive one, and the matter of competing for purchase and demand followed. The reason why the attitude before and after is different lies in the shift of the private interest. One is the matter of military and police donations and winter relief funds, which are completely public welfare matters. From a narrow point of view, there is indeed no private interest at all. Therefore, although the public associations of various industries and commerce have been separately allocated, it is either an excuse or a delay.</p>
<p>Recently, the municipal government issued 150,000,000 yuan of relief treasury bonds, of which 50,000,000 yuan were designated for various trade associations to subscribe in different grades. This is another completely public welfare matter. It is rumored that because public welfare matters in society have been promoted one after another, the industry and commerce associations feel burdened, so some members withdraw from the association and some responsible persons of the association resign. If the withdrawal and resignation are for internal relations, it can be ignored. If the motive is to avoid the burden of public welfare, then public opinion in society will never give up criticism. In fact, there are also restrictions on the withdrawal of association members in law, and the resignation of the person in charge of the association is still a member of the industry and still a citizen of Shanghai, and public welfare undertakings are still inescapable. In the past, in the era of concessions, it was possible to escape under the protection of the British and Americans. The current era environment is completely different. Public welfare matters cannot be escaped, nor can they be haggled over. This should be recognized clearly.</p>
<p>Of the 150,000,000 yuan of relief treasury bonds issued by the municipal government, 100,000,000 yuan is used to make up for the past difference in rationed rice, which is related to the public welfare of all citizens. 50,000,000 yuan is used as temporary relief funds, which is also related to the public welfare of citizens. On the government side, we of course expect to take it from the citizens and use it for the citizens. On the side of the industry and commerce associations, each member is engaged in profit-making, and it can also be said to be taken from the public. Then, it is also a matter of course to fulfill some obligations for the public welfare of the public. Even if the quantity of graded allocations is compared with the actual strength of the members of various industry associations, there is really plenty of leeway. If everyone pays a little attention to public welfare and raises the money as required, it is by no means difficult. Therefore, we hope that the responsible persons of various industry associations will deeply understand the righteousness, attach importance to public welfare, inform fellow members of the industry, and set an example for fellow members of the industry. For example, among our fellow journalists, there are only six Chinese companies, and they are not within the scope of the association. However, we first assumed 6,000,000 yuan. Judging from the economic strength of each newspaper, it is extremely difficult. However, because it is public welfare, there is an obligation to bear it, and we cannot but try our best to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>We have said: "Shanghai's rise and fall, the people of Shanghai are responsible." Especially the leaders of various industries and circles, have greater responsibilities. Only by adhering to the attitude of "Public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual," actively planning for public welfare, we must first jointly overcome the crisis of Shanghai society, and then we can maintain personal interests.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Students Sympathize with Those Out of School and Solicit "Charity School Funds" from Relatives and Friends</h3>
<p>We are very touched by the enthusiastic support for the "Charity School Funds" from readers these past few days. However, in terms of the scope of support, it tends to be biased towards students, especially elementary school students and struggling students, which is truly "misery loves company," and even more intimate. Why are other readers with more resources not providing support? After careful consideration, we believe that readers with resources and experience may think that this matter is too large, the responsibilities are too difficult, and it is not easy to handle well, so they are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. We do not deny this view, and we are willing to do our best to achieve results that will earn public support. Yesterday, we received letters from several pure-hearted children expressing their enthusiasm and hope.</p>
<p>(1) The six students receiving scholarship assistance from this newspaper responded to our "Charity School Funds" initiative with a letter stating: "We six are all students on scholarships provided by your newspaper. Without the help of scholarships, we would all be out of school. We thank your newspaper and the millions of readers for their cultivation. Recently, we saw in your newspaper the news of establishing ten charity elementary schools and launching the "Charity School Funds" initiative, and we were very touched. However, our strength is limited. Following the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength," we will do our best to solicit donations from relatives and friends, totaling 2,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, to be used as "Charity School Funds."</p>
<p>We hope that philanthropists will launch another "Charity School Funds" donation drive to help a group of poor children who are out of school have the opportunity to study like us. We also hope that the students who receive scholarship assistance from your newspaper will also do the same as us and unanimously solicit donations from relatives and friends."</p>
<p>(2) Four children, He Xingdi, Yu Jingjuan, Xu Lijuan, and Huang Jinzhu, wrote: "We four are very righteous, but we want to extend our righteousness. Today, we saw that your newspaper launched the "Charity School Funds" initiative to help children out of school. This is a very righteous work, and we should respond to it. Now, we are contributing the money we have saved on weekdays, totaling 66 yuan, and asking you to include it in the "Charity School Funds" donations. We will send it again after we save more."</p>
<p>(3) An elementary school student, Cheng Jinlong, wrote: "I am a carefree elementary school student, but I was very touched to see your newspaper launch the "Charity School Funds" initiative, because how painful it is for children without books to read! Although I myself don't have much money, I can ask others to donate. Now, I have solicited 2,500 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates from my friend Mr. Hou Yuanlong, which I ask you to include under the "Charity School Funds" item. Please also publish it in the newspaper to show credibility."</p>

<h3>Preferential Treatment for the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>(1) Nanshi Civilian Hospital: The Nanshi Civilian Hospital moved to its new address at 775 Minguo Road last month. In addition to adding various equipment such as a surgical operating room, electrotherapy room, and chemical laboratory, it has also installed a giant X-ray machine for patients to undergo examination, fluoroscopy, and photography all day long. Morning consultations and registration are free, purely to serve the poor and sick. Specialists in internal and external medicine are hired to be responsible for diagnosis and treatment, and free beds are provided to benefit society, which is by no means insignificant.</p>
<p>(2) Wuxi Ren Ci Nursing Home: Mr. Lu Buzhou, a pioneer in the city's printing industry, founded the Ren Ci Nursing Home a year ago in Guanshe Mountain, Wuxi, under the direction of specialists such as Drs. Wang Shibu and Li Jialin. The environment is beautiful, the treatment is thorough, and X-rays, artificial pneumothorax, and other facilities are available at a particularly low cost. Last winter, on the occasion of Mr. Lu's 50th birthday, he used the congratulatory gifts and banquet expenses from his relatives and friends to establish ten fully-funded medical and food beds annually to specifically assist impoverished teachers suffering from lung diseases, to create benefits for his relatives and friends. All current elementary school teachers in this city who are truly unable to afford treatment and have been certified by the principal of their original school can be admitted. Detailed information can be obtained by writing to the hospital's Shanghai office at No. 4, Lane 384, Fuzhou Road.</p>
<p>(3) Lung Disease Clinic: The Lung Disease Clinic at 700 Yuyuan Road is hosted by Dr. Weng Zhefu, who provides consultations and medicines free of charge. He continues to provide free consultations every day from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and provides medicines as appropriate. Twenty free consultation tickets are available and can be picked up in person at this office, while supplies last.</p>
<p>Puji Pills - Saving the World - Longquan Pharmaceutical Factory: Longquan Puji Pills are effective for all seasonal illnesses and are priced low. In order to promote widespread use, in addition to expanding the consignment sales portion, it is also distributing them for free to the poor and sick at the distribution point (No. 25, Lane 761, Jiangsu Road). Each package is still sold at the old price of 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Next Operation Against America to Fall into a State of Chaos - Minister Matsushima Discusses the European and Asian War Situation</h3>
<p>The Allied Japanese Fleet Press Department held a regular meeting yesterday afternoon. Minister Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and reporters from various newspapers attended. First, Minister Matsushima reported on the Pacific war situation, including recent losses of the US Navy. He then discussed the European war situation. An outline of his speech follows:</p>
<p>Pacific War Situation: Recently, the US Navy's mobile force suffered significant damage in the seas south of Kyushu and Shikoku. Over one-third of its aircraft carriers were lost, and battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and carrier-based aircraft all sustained heavy damage. They are currently retreating southward. The Japanese air force is pursuing the retreating enemy. Enemy propaganda claimed that a fleet had attacked Japan's Seto Inland Sea, alleging that the Japanese side suffered considerable losses. However, the Japanese side has not received any such report. The intention behind this speculation is nothing more than to cover up their own losses. The enemy boldly approached the Japanese coast, intending to engage the Japanese fleet in a decisive battle. However, they underestimated Japanese air power, suffered a severe blow, and retreated in defeat. On the 18th and 19th, the sea conditions were exceptionally bad, preventing the Japanese from completely annihilating the enemy, but at least the enemy's attempt was severely thwarted. The enemy's aircraft carrier group's supply line was severely hit, and casualties exceeded 10,000. According to the US announcement, a new-type aircraft carrier, named "Midway," displacing 44,000 tons, was launched on March 1st. This is a typical propaganda tactic by the Americans, intended to explain away their operational losses. With such significant losses for the American military, their next operation will undoubtedly fall into a state of extreme chaos, which is very clear. Therefore, no matter from which direction the enemy attacks, the result will inevitably be heavy losses.</p>
<p>Iwo Jima Battle Situation: The heroic actions of the Japanese army on Iwo Jima have startled ghosts and gods and moved heaven and earth. In the past month, the Japanese army, with a very small force, has achieved unprecedented results in history. The enemy's landing Marine Corps suffered losses of over half, at least 80%. If the enemy plans to land on the Japanese mainland in the future, this example can be seen as the prelude to the operation. Based on strategy, and for the sake of preparing for the decisive battle, the Japanese army could not help but temporarily abandon this island. It is deeply believed that in the near future, the heroic spirits of the warriors on this island will receive considerable consolation.</p>
<p>We cannot predict what the enemy's definite course of action will be, but they will certainly be active in the near future. Judging from the recent situation, the enemy's activities are less likely to be aimed at approaching the mainland and more likely to be directed at the Japanese mainland. The enemy's air force on the mainland has not been very active recently. It is impossible to speculate for the time being as to what we are preparing for the next operation. However, based on the situation in the Philippines, there is a high possibility that the British and American forces will come from Mindanao towards Borneo and Vietnam. In any case, once the enemy approaches the mainland, they will inevitably treat the Chinese people with cruelty and abuse. Therefore, we must do our utmost to prevent them from landing on the mainland.</p>
<p>European War Situation: The Soviet army's encirclement of Danzig has been largely completed on the Eastern Front. The 70 divisions led by Soviet General Govorov have formed an attacking posture towards Berlin from Stettin and Frankfurt. The strength of these 70 divisions is stronger than the 60 divisions commanded by US General Montgomery on the Western Front, thus posing a major threat to the British and Americans. The 1st Ukrainian Front led by Konev is advancing westward south of Bislo to provide assistance, but the German forces near the Warta River are fighting exceptionally bravely, making the Soviet advance very difficult. In the southern Slovak mountain region, the German forces are currently holding their ground, preventing the Soviet advance. The Soviet and Wehrmacht forces are engaged in fierce fighting in Bucharest, especially the battle of the Parauton River, which is the most intense. The area west of the Rhine River is now controlled by the Allied forces, but the German forces on the west bank continue their methodical activities. In the north, the Canadian army and the US 1st Army are attacking Huysaye without making progress. The US 3rd and 7th Armies to the south are also attacking fiercely. In this battle, when the Allied forces crossed the Rhine River and advanced into the Kern-Buhon and Remagen areas, they expanded their bridgeheads, which were very strong. Although the mountain battles in the south are very fierce, the German army is taking advantage of the natural defenses and resisting strongly. The US military recently added the 15th Army in the north, planning to cross the plains in one go and attack Berlin. German Field Marshal Rundstedt is aware of everything and is currently preventing their attack. We express our utmost respect for the German army and its people's courageous fight for life and death, and pray for their victory. Recently, German submarines have been very active in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea and have achieved considerable success, which is also worthy of our admiration.</p>
<h3>Chinese Health Association to Promote TB Screening; Half-Price Screening Certificates Sold by This Office</h3>
<p>Being free from illness is a blessing in life; one only realizes the importance of health when sick. In major cities, tuberculosis is the most widespread infectious disease. According to recent statistics, the spread of tuberculosis has exceeded previous records, significantly affecting public health. The current TB prevention week held in this city, expanding publicity, has great significance. The Chinese Health Association at 996 Jing'an Temple Road is promoting TB prevention work by holding half-price X-ray examinations to popularize diagnosis and early treatment, in order to achieve the goal of saving medical expenses. Modern medicine has progressed from treating diseases to preventing diseases, with TB prevention being the most effective.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Fever, weight loss, cough, insomnia, night sweats, fatigue. Diagnosis: Modern X-ray examination is the simplest and most accurate method.</p>
<p>Statistics: According to recent statistics in the "Xinwenbao" regarding TB loan funds, the number of infected employees reached over 20%, mostly young people aged 20 to 30, which is a serious problem.</p>
<p>Examination Method: TB X-ray examination certificates are sold by this office at half price for 700 yuan per certificate (from today until the end of this month).</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease that causes countless cases of poverty and misery in society and families. It is no exaggeration to call it a "racial disease." We hope that leaders of all units, such as parents, principals, shop owners, and managers of companies and stores, will fulfill their responsibilities and promote and implement screening as much as possible among their subordinates. The more widespread the screening, the safer the society will be.</p>
<h3>Commercial Lecture</h3>
<p>The commercial lecture to be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA this Saturday will be given by the famous professor Wang Yutong, on the topic of "Destiny and Industry." However, the time has been changed to 4:30 PM (originally 3:30 PM). Tickets can be obtained from the United Overseas Bank on Beijing Road or its Jing'an Temple Road branch.</p>
