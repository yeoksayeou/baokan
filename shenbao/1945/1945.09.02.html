<p>毛　東應　將主席之遷，飛赴重慶，我們看到了這一段消息，似乎直覺地感到很愉快，國為面前的除雲，正向旁邊　開　。</p>
<p>為什麼呢？當此聯合國正在辦理接受日本投降之際，　此國民政府正在統　受降與復員之際，忽然突出了一個朱德的電文，我們老百姓的見解，理論的是與否，不必考慮，而在此時此際，有此現象，總是掃興的。况且，八年　苦，一旦光明，而仍有此意外，怎不令人　心，</p>
<p>今毛氏能去撤，道料不無團結的誠意，則一切問題，或可以推誠相與下迎刃而解，　大家熱烈慶祝抗戰勝利全國統一，轉憂為喜，又怎不令人愉快呢？</p>
<h3>談談東北</h3>
<p>— 再生</p>
<p>戰爭八個年頭了，八年中淪陷區的同他們，無日不在地獄中掙扎着今日能夠獲得解放，怎不驚喜，最近又　獲內地同胞們的安慰，更是欣快已極！</p>
<p>可是戰爭只是八年麼？我們的大好山河只淪陷了八年麼？諸位着競「是的」，不，諸位一定對我的問話感到驚異，那我　要放聲大哭了。在淪陷區　的只有八年國恥慶？諸位同胞，沒有想到眞正的國恥，已有十五年了，比你們所競的八年還要多上七年。「九一八」，諸位或者想起了吧，東北也是個淪陷區，在東北卻是淪陷了整整十五年。</p>
<p>他們在十五年中，所遭受的痛苦，比你們還要深還要苦，你們是地獄，他們就是苦海，可是做亡國奴的他們，決不因之自　，而依然有一種孤獨不拔的反抗精神，來給敵人種種的打擊，他們富於沉寂，稟言，他們　不疾　大呼，只是埋着頭去幹，去受苦。因此，在那邊的佔領者，也最感不安，而壓制兇暴的手段，也　出不窮，舉例來看，佔領者在那是逮蹠上，做着許多防衛工作，想把邊　建　成銅墻鐵壁，勝過馬奇諾，齊格菲！於是，每天不斷的用火車載着成千成萬的工人，這是拉夫拉來的這些可憐的被拉者，日夜做着馬牛直到筯疲力盡血枯油乾，才能默默地趟下享着永生的休息。他們的親屬，失去了手足，失蹤了骨肉，該是如何的痛苦傷心，可是，他們忍耐地咽下了酸心的涙，千　人只有一條心—　想着祖國，一個信念—相信「波　」是不會亡的。</p>
<p>因此，他們寗死也不給侵略者完成夢想，相反地只有　　所以，當盟軍進伐的時候會很暫易地光復了很多地方，使得敵人措手不及，一方面可以說完全出於同胞們所逹生的反抗　神所致。</p>
<p>者於三年前、恨着某種使命，到僞國去作一部份巡視工作，三年倒有二年，以某種媒疑而被羈於沙漠不毛之地，就以感化為名，列於拉夫之中，作着所謂防禦工作。食為枇糠，　是沙土，穿則軍衣　飲泥水，過着人們，想不到的地獄生活，問或　　毒打，病則棄之泥溝。　者脫逃五次，四次復　虎口，其中刑法之奇，行法之毒是秦漢苛法，亦莫之及。雖遭酷刑，幸未表致命，以一息尙存必做破　之鳥，末次固託上天之福，脫　卻人間地獄，今日思之　不寒而慄。</p>

<h3>Labor Strike on Two Railways Resolved After Mediation; Traffic Expected to Fully Resume Today</h3>
<p>The entire staff of the "Central China Railway Company" suddenly went on strike the afternoon before yesterday, resulting in the suspension of afternoon train services on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line yesterday. It is understood that the "Central China Railway Company" has approximately 30,000 employees. Due to the impending closure of the "Central China Railway Company," they presented four labor demands to the Japanese side the day before yesterday:</p>
<p>Four Demands</p>
<p>Each employee should be paid a termination fee of 3 million pseudo-currency yuan. Salaries and due rations for September should be issued in advance. Before the "Central China Railway Company" is handed over to our government, all proceeds from ticket sales should be kept in the custody of the Chinese authorities to prevent further embezzlement and absconding by ticket sellers. All equipment in the railway bureau should be inspected and sealed by the Department of the Two Railways and relevant Chinese authorities to prevent theft. After this incident occurred, the Party Headquarters of the Two Railways immediately dispatched Commissioner Chen Fan-ke to the North Station the day before yesterday to mediate with the employees and the "Central China Railway Company," and also met with the Vice President and Director of the Administration Bureau of the "Central China Railway Company" to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>No Progress</p>
<p>As a result, no progress was made, and all employees immediately went on strike the evening before yesterday. Yesterday morning, Commissioner Chen went to the "Office Area" of the North Station again, convened a meeting of all employees, and instructed them that maintaining transportation was of utmost importance. He said that if they were serving the country, they could even endure hunger. All locomotives at the North Station are ready to depart. If our side has troop movements or the government has needs, the vehicles can be dispatched immediately and there will be no impact due to the strike. However, passenger trains will only resume service after the Japanese side has provided a satisfactory response.</p>
<p>Mediation Meeting</p>
<p>The Party Headquarters of the Two Railways convened a mediation meeting at 2:00 PM, inviting employee representatives and the person in charge of "Hua Tie." Director Shi Yushou, Commissioner Chen Fan-ke, and Commissioner Chen Fuhai from the Ministry of Transportation attended and presided over the meeting. Over 30 employee representatives and Zheng Hongnian, a representative of "Hua Tie," attended. The meeting lasted approximately two hours, and the following resolutions were agreed upon on the spot: The termination fee of 3 million pseudo-currency yuan per employee will be paid as agreed.

Employees' public debt savings will also be issued concurrently. The two items relating to railway administration will be temporarily reserved. All employees recognized that the negotiations had achieved satisfactory results, and all resumed work at 6:00 PM yesterday.

These armed comrades, who had been imprisoned for three to four years, were captured in various battlefields since the War of Resistance. Many had been imprisoned for more than three or four years. Because these heroes of the War of Resistance remained loyal after being captured in various war zones, the Japanese transferred them to Shanghai for centralized custody. On the 16th of last month, when victory was achieved, many left voluntarily. There are currently still 300 people living there.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Turning Sorrow into Joy</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>Mao Zedong responded to Chairman Jiang's invitation and flew to Chongqing. When we saw this news, we felt instinctively happy, because the clouds in front of us were gradually dispersing.</p>
<p>Why is that? At a time when the United Nations is handling the acceptance of Japan's surrender, and the National Government is unifying the acceptance of surrender and demobilization, Zhu De's telegram suddenly appeared. It is not necessary to consider whether our common people's views are theoretical or not, but at this time and at this moment, this phenomenon is always disappointing. Moreover, after eight years of hardship, once there is light, there is still this unexpected event. How can it not be disappointing?</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Mao can go there, it shows that there is a sincere intention for unity. Then all problems can be solved with sincerity and mutual understanding. Everyone enthusiastically celebrates the victory of the War of Resistance and national unification, turning sorrow into joy. How can it not be pleasing?</p>
<h3>Talking About the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Rebirth</p>
<p>The war has lasted for eight years. The compatriots in the occupied areas have been struggling in hell every day for eight years. How can they not be surprised to be liberated today? Recently, they have also received comfort from their compatriots in the inland areas, which is extremely joyful!</p>
<p>But has the war only been eight years? Has our good country only been occupied for eight years? You are eager to say "yes." No, you must be surprised by my question. Then I have to cry out loud. Is there only eight years of national humiliation in the occupied areas? Compatriots, have you not thought that the real national humiliation has been fifteen years? That is seven years more than the eight years you are eager to say. The "September 18th Incident," you may have remembered it. The Northeast is also an occupied area, but it has been occupied for a full fifteen years.</p>
<p>The suffering they have endured in fifteen years is deeper and more bitter than yours. You are in hell, and they are in the sea of bitterness. But as slaves to a conquered nation, they will never abandon themselves because of this, but still have a spirit of lonely and unyielding resistance to give the enemy all kinds of blows. They are rich in silence and taciturnity. They do not shout loudly, but bury their heads to work and suffer. Therefore, the occupiers there are also most uneasy, and the means of suppression and brutality are endless. To give an example, the occupiers are doing a lot of defensive work there, trying to build the border into an impregnable fortress, surpassing the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line! So, every day, countless workers are transported by train. These poor people who were conscripted from Latvia are working day and night like horses and cattle until their muscles are exhausted, their blood is dry, and they can only silently lie down and enjoy eternal rest. How painful and heartbroken their relatives must be to lose their limbs and their flesh and blood. However, they endured and swallowed the sour tears. Thousands of people have only one heart—thinking about the motherland, and one belief—believing that "Poland" will not be destroyed.</p>
<p>Therefore, they would rather die than help the invaders achieve their dreams. On the contrary, there is only resistance. So, when the Allied forces invaded, many places were easily recovered, catching the enemy by surprise. On the one hand, it can be said that it is entirely due to the spirit of resistance achieved by the compatriots.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the author, with a certain mission, went to the puppet country to do some inspection work. For two of those three years, he was detained in a barren desert area on suspicion of something and listed among the conscripted workers under the guise of reformation, doing so-called defensive work. He ate chaff and soil, wore military uniforms, and drank mud water, living a hellish life that people could not imagine. He was often beaten and left in ditches when he was sick. The author escaped five times, and four times he returned to the tiger's mouth. The strangeness of the torture and the cruelty of the execution were even worse than the harsh laws of the Qin and Han dynasties. Although he suffered cruel torture, he was fortunate not to be fatally injured. With a breath of life remaining, he must be a bird of destruction. In the end, he relied on the blessings of heaven to escape the hell on earth. Thinking about it today, I still shudder.</p>
