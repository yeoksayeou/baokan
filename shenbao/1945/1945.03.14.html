<p>東京十三日中央社電　日駐越南軍司令部二日傍晚發出佈吿，表明完成鞏固防衛越南任務之決意，並　闡明對原住民政府決無加以任何改變之意圖。其佈吿要點如次：</p>
<p>本次措置，係因法領越南政府不履行共同防衛越南任務。　駐屯軍有與原住民民政府共同完遂防衛趣南任務之決意。　對原住民政府不加改變，尊重旣有之諸法令。　不問法國安南及其他任何國人，凡協力日軍者仍繼續從前之任務。　基於大東亞宣言，支援健全民族運動，如佈吿所示安南王國·東埔賽王國·及琅勃剌邦國，均人舊維持其現在之政府。又關於交趾支那及東京之處理辦法，亦即將陸續發表，然法方之政治組織大致甚變動，仍由交趾政府東京政府各自行使其行政。</p>

<h3 id="c7">保衛越南的重要性 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>日本爲保障越南防衛，三月九日對背倍的南法方，採取必要的斷然措置，並解除了越南軍警的武裝，已順利完成任務；十一日，越南王國保大帝，代表越南二千三百萬民衆，發表廢棄法越保護條約，恢復獨立的宣言，並願舉總力以與日本相協力。在保障大東亞共榮圈的安全和完整上，不論軍事的，政治的，以及經濟方面，都具有深長的意義。</p>
<p>軍事方面，觀乎越南的地理位置，北接中國大陸，西鄰泰國以至緬甸，西南階邏羅灣口，就是沿泰緬而下的馬來半島，東南面隔海爲婆羅洲，東則近海有海南島以下西沙·新南諸泰島，並離菲律賓祇約六百餘海涅，可說是東西大陸島嶼的咽喉，東南海的胸朣，也即是連繫中國大陸和南洋各島的橋樑，保衛大東亞海陸的南方前哨。且從日軍完成大陸縱斷綫以來，越南的地位，更日趨重要；而當敵美侵佔菲律賓，敵英在印緬及蘇門答臘近海企圖蠢動之際，越南處境也愈見衝要。但正這緊要時期，越南法國官憲，竟還不能忘却其奴視越南之傳統的錯誤觀念，而跟敵人暗通聲氣，甚至圖謀不規行動，日本出以斷然措置，防患未然，實有必要。這以後，東亞共榮圈在南方的防衛，當可益臻鞏固，而敵人的陰謀，也已全部遭受粉碎了。</p>
<p>就政治意義說，越南自遭受法國奴視，已逾百年，雖在大東亞其檾圈內，但日本爲信守日法共同防衛越南的公約，所以法人仍保持在越權益，現在法國官憲旣自行毀棄公約，圖復活其在越南完全的殖民地統治，日本爲保障整個東亞安全，爲澈底解放越南人民，自不能不出以斷然行動。十一日起，越南在日軍支援之下，已宣吿獨立，從此，南洋各民族自泰國以下，匪律賓·緬甸·越南已相繼完成獨立，馬來·蘇門答臘·爪哇等，不久亦可獲得獨立自主。顯然的，經越南的獨立，更可促成東亞民族鞏固的團結，協力作戰，繫滅共同敵人。</p>
<p>至於經濟方面，越南是著名產米區，又屬煤產極豐的地方，乃被稱「黑白兼富」之地。它的米產僅次於中國，日本和印度，而居世界第四位，年產約達七噸。煤的產量，過去年產約二百五十餘萬噸，經日本協力開發後，當可增產不少，且埋藏景豐富，而其無烟煤質地之住，推世界第一。此外，越南在農產方面，又盛產橡膠·玉蜀黍·烟草·茶·椰子及木材等，各種資源無不得天獨厚，而大部份又未曾開發·有「未磨的珍珠」之稱。所以保衛取之不盡用之不竭的越南，在東亞國防經濟的意義上，顯然也非常重要。</p>
<p>東亞各民族爲保障東亞大家安全，爲澈底爭取自身的自由，必然一致支持日本在越南之新的措置，並當慶賀越南的獨立。</p>
<h3 id="c8">三寶顏日軍　展開壯烈空繫　呂宋各據點仍激戰中 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>南方前綫日軍某基地十三日中央社電　民答那峨島西南端三寶顏之敵軍，邇來繼續攻繫，於艦砲射繫及飛機之掩護下，侵入日飛機塲，日軍第一綫部落隊，十一日全日猛烈砲火，實行壯烈之突繫，使敵物資集積所起火，殺傷軍數百，使其敵陣大亂。</p>
<p>呂宋十三日中央社電　敵軍對馬尼剌東方日軍據點之攻勢逐步激化，並以馬尼剌東北方·蒙達班東方·安其保魯西方爲攻繫之重點，尤以安保魯附近，敵方連日發動激戰。敵軍刻正對安其保魯南方·拉克周島畔·摩倫等處，更以克拉克陸上之輸送與湖上舟艇之活動，繼續增强兵力反復發動猛攻。又敵機空襲亦極激烈，一日連續有三百架來襲日方各據點旁，均以槍砲射繫，由該方日軍陣地，遠見科列基金島上殘餘之日軍兵士，現尙繼續奮戰，對苦戰三旬以一殺百之日軍奮勇精神，不禁肅然起敬。</p>
<p>伊藤肉摶隊　建樹奇功</p>
<p>東京二下三日中央社電　於呂宋島作戰向敵陣中果敢肉捕，樹立超羣武功之伊藤肉搏隊，前曾由軍司令官授與獎章。茲十三日陸軍省發表稱：上項事件已奏呈天皇云。按伊藤肉搏隊係由陸軍上士伊藤謗次郞爲隊長，選拔下士官等四十士官等四十七所組成，該肉搏隊於二日夜對聖瑪利亞及波羅衛附近向馬尼剌南下中之敵機甲部隊，實行勇猛攻繫，至三日晨繫毀敵戰車八輛兵車四輛拖車一輛，殺傷人員三百五十名以上，日方亦有廿名以下壯烈戰死。</p>

<p>東京十三日中央社電　硫黃島日軍部隊，十一日仍於漂流本北部落前面，至天山與東玉名山一帶，猛烈反攻敵軍，畫間因敵軍砲火與轟炸，故日軍多施夜間挺身肉搏，而有甚大之戰果。日軍戰車部隊自敵登陸以來。無日不與優勢之敵方戰車激鬥，因此戰畫之損失自然累增，然日軍士氣却仍軒昂如故。在三月一日至十日之問，日本戰車部隊所獲之確實戰果如次：攔淺燃燒敵戰車八輛，殺傷敵兵一千二百名。</p>

<h3 id="c11">洞庭山調查記（一） <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>本市疏散人口工作，漸趨積極，前以項康原氏有闢洞庭山爲疏散區之建議，引起一般人之注意，故記者奉派前往該地考察，遷留四日。茲將沿途觀感所及，擇要報吿於後。</p>
<p>沿途情形</p>
<p>由姑蘇往洞庭，路徑有二，一爲由西門外之大洋橋堍永源碼頭，搭保大與通茂輪船公司之聯榮或飛虎汽船，經橫塘·越溪·橫涇·浦莊·石塘·渡村直達東山之前山；一爲搭俗稱「龍飛快」之民航船，由木賣出胥口，經北太湖至東山，如係天晴風順，張帆駛行，以取捷徑故，雖較汽船啓椗稍遲，反光抵達。蓋前者全程九十華里，兼在沿途停靠載客，故需時六七小時。後者則以湖匪猖獗，行人裏足，汽船較爲安全，故記者捨此而就彼也。</p>
<p>晨九時，汽船由蘇開行，約三刻鐘抵橫塘鎭。船經彩雲橋，橋係大石所建，甚高，民謠有「蘇州高橋不算高，橫塘還有彩雲橋」。當地石灰窰及陶器廠至爲發達，其原料靑石皆來自洞庭西山，通藝磯灰公司爲是爲巨譬。離橫塘，經黃山達厜湖。此間有上方山，山頭有廟，每年中秋佳節，各地善男信女，紛紛來此進香，煞是熱鬧。上方山對岸，有姜太公釣魚台，鄧俗稱雙墩者，則爲高僅及丈，雜草業生，孤立湖中之二小土邱耳。過越溪至橫涇鎭，兩岸巨型酒罎疊積如山，據同船者吿，橫涇農民十九以造酒爲副業，酒糟則用以飼猪，目下米價高漲，酒之成本亦高，鄕民造成後售與酒行，由酒行運滬轉售。現今鄕間小罎酒（六十市斤）約售價三萬元，運滬後可得四萬元，大罎（四百斤）約値念二三萬元，除納財政部酒照費每罎六百元外，沿途開銷亦屬可觀，獲利非易，但鄕民因飼猪關係，操是業者仍衆。</p>
<p>由橫涇至東山約四小時，船中午餐豐美異常，五菜一湯，大魚大肉，代價每客七百金，如此情形，實非在米珠號桂之都市如上海者所能辦到。</p>
<p>名勝特產</p>
<p>按洞庭山處太湖之濱，在七十二峯之列，風景秀麗，名滿江南。山分東西，兩山祗隔一水，往返賴小舟，順風時約一小時可達，太硝湖面遼關，風浪至大，而間乎兩山中之「灣內」，湖面驟狹，永道亦急，故逆流時舟行至緩。</p>
<p>東山三面球水，僅一面與陸相接，具半島形態。東山面積爲四十八圖半，長約十八里，記者窮三日之功，遍遊該山之「前山」「後山」「山後」，訪問農家，調查一切。亦曾攀登東山之最高峯大尖頂（又名莫離峯高四百公尺），當時因時近黃昏，山頭風勢甚勁，可遙望隔岸之西山，俯視湖中，則扁舟似葉隨波逐流，景色至佳。</p>
<p>洞庭所產之水菓，遐邇知名，由杏至橘，其種類有十六種之多，尤以後山灣內（又名七灣）沿湖村落之批杷與楊梅及名茶碧螺春，膾　人口，味美而甜，淸香欉鼻，西山以地質關係，品質稍差，不能與東山相比。除水菓外，洞庭山之滴業，亦至發達，漁民沿太湖築有魚塘，數在一萬處以上，平均每日有漁船兩艘，滿載魚蝦，駛往蘇滬等地銷售。</p>
<p>西山孤立太湖中，面積爲七十二圖半，南北長約四十五里，四週多巨石，突出湖中，以富石灰質關係，經常受湖水之冲激，致多空洞，形成假山石形狀。山中名勝至夥，首推鎭夏鄕之石公山，該處三面臨湖，一面連山，四旁石壁林立，高可十餘丈，名勝有一線天，雲梯，歸雲洞，夕光洞，龍渚，而林屋洞爲其著者，沿山而築，深約二百餘尺。</p>
<p>西山因地質關係（爲煤灰石炭層），所出水菓不及東山，但匯里鄕之白沙枇杷，及鎭夏鄕山東村之楊梅，亦可媲美東山。至鹿村鄕產靑石（查該鄕有大木船，數近百艘，專裝靑石經太湖轉往蘇州嘉興等地，作　石灰之原料，當地有石灰窰三處，工人近五百人），東湖鎭有煤礦（該鎭有煤礦公司二，爲寶成與寶山兩定，現爲軍管理，出品泰半運蘇州供電廠之需，創辦人羅甘棠，該礦有念餘件之歷史，現工人近千）。該山育蠶事業亦頗發達。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c27">戰爭時期的　上海郵政總局 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 熙</p>
<p>北四川路的郵政總局是全上海郵件轉運的總樞紐，在戰前每天有十六萬到二十多萬封信件從這裏分送到全世界去；即使是一個極小的村鎭，也可以發現蓋着上海郵戳的信件。可是現在最多時也只有七八萬封信件。郵局負有爲成千成萬人傳甚消息的重大使命，所以其工作的疏忽和懈怠日將發生嚴重的影響。</p>
<p>郵局的經濟情形目前很困難，主要原因當然是由於寄信者較從前少了，郵費增高也追不上一般物價的上昇率。當然還有許多原因，不是局外人所得而知。</p>
<p>郵局員工的薪津每月分三次發給，最低的薪津是二萬四千元，最高也不過四萬元，這個數目，顯然不足維持一家人的正常生活。所以郵務佐。郵務員等的家裏也就不得不吃苞米粉，山芋，喝稀飯了。他們在過着淸苦的生活，從前爲人垂涏三尺的「鐵飯碗」，現在已不再爲人稱羨了。因之，有些員工改行，有些「居家候令」有些貧病交迫的死掉，局裏也不再添新人。郵局員工的福利組織一點也沒有，只有年齡達到六十歲者退職才有二十萬元的養老金，但這權利怎能每個員工享受呢！</p>
<p>由於生活的重壓，員工們在工作時總念念不忘米，柴，油，鹽，因此影響了工作效率，郵差因爲不常受軍警檢查和留難，一部份人便經常作點小買賣，或代人運送點米，麵煤球之類，所以，郵筒衰的人有時不能準時去收，郵件的分發也許等私事做完了再辦，有的揀信生不免打不起勁來工作，於是影響到遞送的速度，但本埠收到較遲還有一種原因，那便是檢查關係，現在每天由總局發出的四五萬封信件中，就有一萬多件被抽出檢查，這種檢查在戰時當然非常需要，但因此將延攔三四天，有的長至一個月才能通過。從前檢查後全蓋「檢印」的，現在這手續已少掉了。</p>
<p>郵局員工待遇如不改善，舟車等交通工具如不準期行駛，郵遞遲延的現象自然不是一時所能改善的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fully Support a Sound National Movement, Determined to Defend Vietnam: Announcement by the Japanese Military Command in Vietnam <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Military Command in Vietnam issued an announcement on the evening of the 2nd, stating its determination to complete the task of solidifying the defense of Vietnam, and clarifying that it has no intention of making any changes to the native government. Key points of the announcement are as follows:</p>
<p>This measure is due to the French government in Vietnam failing to fulfill its duty to jointly defend Vietnam. The stationed army is determined to jointly accomplish the task of defending Vietnam with the native government. There will be no changes to the native government, and existing laws and ordinances will be respected. Regardless of whether they are French, Annamese, or from any other country, those who cooperate with the Japanese army will continue their previous tasks. Based on the Greater East Asia Declaration, support will be given to sound national movements. As the announcement shows, the Annam Kingdom, the Kingdom of Champasak, and the Kingdom of Luang Prabang will all maintain their current governments. Furthermore, the handling of Cochinchina and Tonkin will be announced successively. However, the French political organizations will remain largely unchanged, with the Cochinchina government and the Tonkin government continuing to exercise their administration independently.</p>
<p>The Viet Minh Declaration Closely Cooperates with Japan</p>
<p>Hanoi, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Greater Vietnam National Alliance, in gratitude for Emperor Bảo Đại's declaration of independence for the Kingdom of Annam, issued the following statement on the 12th: "We, the Annamese people, who have been groaning under the oppression of white imperialism by France, have established the foundation of an independent Annam with the support of the Japanese Empire. Furthermore, on the 10th, the Japanese government made a statement that it would spare no effort in fully supporting the independence of the Annamese people. Our 25 million compatriots are deeply grateful for this. We, the Annamese people, are determined to cooperate with the Japanese Empire and contribute all our strength to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>
<h3 id="e2">Vietnamese People Unite, Strive for Victory - General Matsui Issues Statement <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government has resolutely excluded the treacherous behavior of the Vietnamese authorities and taken independent defense measures. Recently, General Iwane Matsui, head of the Asia Development Headquarters of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, issued the following statement on the 12th on this point: "The long-held aspiration of the Vietnamese people for independence has finally been achieved after decades. The Asia Development Headquarters, representing the national movement organizations of our country, with the aim of revitalizing Asia, expresses its heartfelt congratulations on this. However, the great task of nation-building cannot be easily accomplished; it cannot be realized without experiencing great difficulties. It is expected that Vietnamese territory will be ravaged by enemy Anglo-American flames of war, threatening the safety of the people's livelihood. We must never again entrust the prosperity of Asia to their evil hands. We expect the Vietnamese people to rise up bravely at this moment, drive back the enemy, and work hard to enhance their combat power. Our one hundred million Japanese people firmly believe that spiritual power surpasses material power and are continuing a bloody battle day and night to destroy the Anglo-American ambition to invade Asia. We also believe that the Vietnamese people, who have the same spirit of bloody battle as other Asian peoples, will not only maintain their glorious past history but also become a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and continue to rise up to pass on the honor of independence gained through bloody struggle to their descendants. Dear people of Vietnam! Our two nations will become more unified and move towards a common goal, fighting to the end to win the final victory."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Feelings Expressed by Annam Independence Fighters <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Saigon, 13th (Central News Agency) – After Annam abolished the French-Annam Protectorate Treaty, the reporter specially interviewed the Annam people. According to Mr. Hồ Nguyễn Tân, an Annam independence fighter who had been in hiding for a long time, expressed the following feelings on the 11th: "The past eighty years have been long and painful for us Annamese people. Due to the suppression by the French constitution, most of my friends were tragically shot or starved to death in prison. However, there are still a few people remaining in the prison on Poulo Condore Island. The independence and liberation that could not be achieved with the blood of tens of millions of people has suddenly arrived, which truly makes me feel lost. We must take this opportunity to unify the country. For the Annam of the Annamese, we must unite as one. Our country was born under war, and there may be various difficulties in life, but when we think of the bloodshed and hard work of our past comrades, we can achieve complete unity."</p>

The French nationals in the area were happy to adhere to the spirit of joint defense with Japan and cooperate to the end. There were no violations and they all remained calm.

<h3 id="e7">The Importance of Defending Vietnam <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>To secure the defense of Vietnam, Japan took necessary and decisive measures against the treacherous French side on March 9, and disarmed the Vietnamese military and police, successfully completing the task. On the 11th, Emperor Bảo Đại of the Kingdom of Vietnam, representing the 23 million people of Vietnam, declared the abolition of the Franco-Vietnamese Protectorate Treaty, restored independence, and expressed his willingness to cooperate with Japan with all his strength. This has profound significance in terms of military, political, and economic aspects in ensuring the security and integrity of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>From a military perspective, considering Vietnam's geographical location, it borders mainland China to the north, Thailand and Burma to the west, and the Malay Peninsula along the Gulf of Siam to the southwest. To the southeast, it is separated by sea from Borneo, and to the east, it is close to Hainan Island and the Xisha and Nansha Islands, and is only about 600 nautical miles from the Philippines. It can be said to be the throat of the eastern and western continents and islands, the chest of the Southeast Sea, and the bridge connecting mainland China and the islands of the South Seas, serving as the southern outpost for the defense of the Greater East Asia Sea and Land. Since the Japanese army completed the continental longitudinal line, Vietnam's position has become increasingly important. And when the enemy America occupied the Philippines and the enemy Britain attempted to stir up trouble in India, Burma, and the waters near Sumatra, Vietnam's situation became even more critical. But precisely during this critical period, the French officials in Vietnam were still unable to forget their traditional erroneous concept of treating Vietnam with contempt, and secretly colluded with the enemy, even plotting irregular actions. Japan's decisive measures to prevent trouble before it happens were necessary. After this, the defense of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the south will be further strengthened, and the enemy's conspiracies will be completely shattered.</p>
<p>From a political perspective, Vietnam has been subjected to French contempt for over a century. Although within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Japan, in order to abide by the treaty of joint Franco-Japanese defense of Vietnam, allowed the French to retain their interests in Vietnam. Now that the French officials have unilaterally abandoned the treaty and attempted to revive their complete colonial rule in Vietnam, Japan, in order to ensure the security of the entire East Asia and to thoroughly liberate the Vietnamese people, had no choice but to take decisive action. Since the 11th, Vietnam has declared independence with the support of the Japanese army. From then on, the nations of the South Seas, from Thailand onwards, the Philippines, Burma, and Vietnam have successively achieved independence, and Malaya, Sumatra, Java, etc., will soon achieve independence and autonomy. Obviously, the independence of Vietnam will further promote the consolidated unity of East Asian nations, cooperate in combat, and destroy the common enemy.</p>
<p>From an economic perspective, Vietnam is a well-known rice-producing region and also a place rich in coal, known as a land of "both black and white riches." Its rice production ranks fourth in the world, after China, Japan, and India, with an annual output of about seven million tons. The coal production in the past was about 2.5 million tons per year, and after Japanese cooperation in development, it can be increased significantly. It also has abundant buried resources, and the quality of its anthracite coal is the best in the world. In addition, Vietnam is also rich in agricultural products such as rubber, corn, tobacco, tea, coconuts, and timber. Various resources are naturally endowed, and most of them have not yet been developed, earning it the name "unpolished pearl." Therefore, protecting Vietnam, a source that never runs dry, is clearly very important in terms of East Asia's national defense economy.</p>
<p>The nations of East Asia, in order to ensure the security of the East Asia family and to thoroughly strive for their own freedom, will inevitably support Japan's new measures in Vietnam and congratulate Vietnam on its independence.</p>

<p>A certain base of the Japanese Southern Front Army, 13th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces in Zamboanga, at the southwestern tip of Mindanao Island, have continued to attack recently. Under the cover of naval gunfire and aircraft, they invaded the Japanese airfield. The Japanese first-line brigade launched a valiant surprise attack on the 11th with fierce artillery fire throughout the day, setting fire to the enemy's material accumulation points, killing and wounding hundreds of enemy soldiers, and causing great chaos in the enemy阵营.</p>
<p>Luzon, 13th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's offensive against the Japanese strongholds east of Manila has gradually intensified, focusing on the northeast of Manila, east of Montalban, and west of Antipolo. The enemy has launched fierce battles in the vicinity of Antipolo for several days. The enemy is currently continuing to reinforce its forces at the south of Antipolo, the shores of Laguna de Bay, Morong, etc., using land transportation and lake boats from Clark Air Base, and repeatedly launching fierce attacks. The enemy's air raids are also extremely fierce, with up to 300 aircraft attacking various Japanese strongholds on this one day. The Japanese forces on the side all fired with guns and cannons. From the Japanese positions there, the remaining Japanese soldiers on Corregidor Island can be seen continuing to fight valiantly. The spirit of the Japanese soldiers, who have been fighting fiercely for three weeks and killing a hundred enemies with one blow, is deeply respected.</p>
<p>Ito's Close Combat Unit Achieves Miraculous Feats</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Ito Close Combat Unit, which fought bravely against the enemy in Luzon, establishing outstanding military exploits, was previously awarded medals by the Commander-in-Chief. The Army Ministry announced on the 13th that the above incident has been reported to the Emperor. The Ito Close Combat Unit was formed by Sergeant Ito Masatsugu as the leader, and consisted of 47 non-commissioned officers. On the night of the 2nd, the Close Combat Unit launched a brave attack against the enemy armored units moving south to Manila near Santa Maria and Polo, destroying eight enemy tanks, four troop carriers, and one tow truck, killing and wounding more than 350 personnel. Less than 20 Japanese soldiers also died valiantly.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Japanese troops on Iwo Jima continued to fiercely counterattack the enemy in the area from the front of the drifting northern tribe to Mount Tenno and Mount Higashiyama on the 11th. During the day, due to enemy artillery fire and bombing, the Japanese army mostly carried out night close combat, resulting in significant combat results. The Japanese tank units have been engaged in fierce battles with superior enemy tanks every day since the enemy landed. Therefore, the losses of combat during the day have naturally accumulated. However, the morale of the Japanese soldiers remains as high as ever. From March 1 to 10, the confirmed combat results achieved by the Japanese tank units are as follows: burning eight enemy tanks and killing and wounding 1,200 enemy soldiers.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Investigation Diary of Dongting Mountain (1) <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>The work of evacuating the population of this city is gradually becoming more active. Previously, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan's suggestion to open Dongting Mountain as an evacuation area has attracted the attention of the general public. Therefore, the reporter was dispatched to investigate the area and stayed for four days. The observations along the way are summarized and reported below.</p>
<p>Situation Along the Way</p>
<p>There are two routes from Suzhou to Dongting. One is to take the Lianrong or Flying Tiger steamship of Baoda and Tongmao Shipping Companies from the Yongyuan Wharf at the bridgehead of Dayang Bridge outside the West Gate, passing through Hengtang, Yuexi, Hengjing, Puzhuang, Shitang, and Ducun, directly reaching Qianshan of Dongshan. The other is to take the civil aviation ship, commonly known as "Longfei Fast," from Mudu and going through Xukou, passing through North Taihu Lake to Dongshan. If the weather is clear and the wind is favorable, sailing will take a shortcut. Although the steamship departs a little later, it arrives earlier. The former is a total of 90 li, and it also stops along the way to pick up passengers, so it takes six or seven hours. The latter is because lake bandits are rampant, and pedestrians are insufficient. Steamships are safer, so the reporter abandoned this route and took the other.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM, the steamship departed from Suzhou, and arrived at Hengtang Town in about three quarters of an hour. The ship passed over Caiyun Bridge, which was built of large stones and is very high. The local folk song goes, "Suzhou's high bridge is not high, Hengtang also has Caiyun Bridge." The local lime kilns and pottery factories are very developed, and the raw material, bluestone, all comes from Xishan in Dongting. The Tongyi Lime Company is a large enterprise there. Leaving Hengtang, it reaches Cuiliu Lake via Huangshan. There is Mount Shangfang here, and there is a temple on the top of the mountain. Every year during the Mid-Autumn Festival, devout men and women from all over come here to offer incense, which is very lively. Opposite Mount Shangfang is Jiang Taigong's Fishing Platform. The so-called Shuangdun is two small mounds, only about ten feet high, covered with weeds, isolated in the lake. Passing Yuexi to Hengjing Town, huge wine jars are stacked like mountains on both sides of the river. According to a fellow passenger, 90% of the farmers in Hengjing use winemaking as a side business, and the wine lees are used to feed pigs. Now that rice prices are soaring, the cost of wine is also high. After the villagers make it, they sell it to the wine merchants, who transport it to Shanghai for resale. Currently, small jars of wine (60 market catties) sell for about 30,000 yuan in the countryside. After being transported to Shanghai, they can get 40,000 yuan. Large jars (400 catties) are worth about 220,000 to 30,000 yuan. In addition to paying the Ministry of Finance's wine license fee of 600 yuan per jar, the expenses along the way are also considerable, and it is not easy to make a profit. However, due to the pig-raising relationship, many villagers are still engaged in this business.</p>
<p>It takes about four hours to travel from Hengjing to Dongshan. The lunch on the boat is exceptionally rich, with five dishes and one soup, including large fish and meat, costing 700 yuan per person. Such a situation is not possible in rice-expensive cities like Shanghai.</p>
<p>Scenic Spots and Specialties</p>
<p>Dongting Mountain is located on the shore of Taihu Lake, one of the seventy-two peaks, with beautiful scenery and a reputation throughout Jiangnan. The mountain is divided into East and West, and the two mountains are separated by only one body of water. Travel depends on small boats. When the wind is favorable, it takes about an hour to reach the other side. The surface of Taihu Lake is vast, and the wind and waves are very large. However, in the "bay" between the two mountains, the lake surface suddenly narrows, and the waterway also becomes rapid. Therefore, the boat travels very slowly against the current.</p>
<p>Dongshan is surrounded by water on three sides, with only one side connected to land, forming a peninsula shape. The area of Dongshan is 48.5 maps, with a length of about 18 li. The reporter spent three days traveling all over the "Qianshan," "Houshan," and "Shanhou" of the mountain, visiting farmers, and investigating everything. I also climbed the highest peak of Dongshan, Dajinding (also known as Moli Peak, 400 meters high). At that time, because it was close to dusk, the wind on the top of the mountain was very strong. You could see Xishan across the shore from a distance. Looking down at the lake, the flat boats seemed like leaves drifting with the waves. The scenery was excellent.</p>
<p>The fruits produced in Dongting are well-known far and wide. From apricots to tangerines, there are as many as sixteen varieties. In particular, the loquats and waxberries of the lakeside villages in the bay of Houshan (also known as Qiawan) and the famous tea Biluochun are known to everyone. They are delicious and sweet, with a fragrant aroma. Due to geological reasons, the quality of Xishan is slightly inferior and cannot be compared with Dongshan. In addition to fruits, the fishery industry in Dongting Mountain is also very developed. Fishermen have built fish ponds along Taihu Lake, with more than 10,000 ponds. On average, two fishing boats are fully loaded with fish and shrimp every day, heading to Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places for sale.</p>
<p>Xishan is isolated in Taihu Lake, with an area of 72.5 maps, a north-south length of about 45 li, and is surrounded by many huge rocks protruding into the lake. Due to the abundance of lime, it is constantly impacted by lake water, resulting in many cavities, forming rock garden shapes. There are many scenic spots in the mountain, the first being Shigong Mountain in Zhenxia Township. The area is surrounded by the lake on three sides, and connected to the mountains on one side. Stone walls stand on all sides, as high as ten feet. Famous scenic spots include Yixiantian (One Line Sky), Yunti (Cloud Ladder), Guiyun Cave (Returning Cloud Cave), Xiguang Cave (Sunset Cave), and Longzhu (Dragon Islet). Linwu Cave is the most famous, built along the mountain and about 200 feet deep.</p>
<p>Due to geological reasons (coal ash and carboniferous layers), the fruits produced in Xishan are not as good as those in Dongshan. However, the Bisha loquats in Huili Township and the waxberries in Shandong Village in Zhenxia Township can also be compared with Dongshan. The Qing stone is produced in Lucun Township (the township has nearly a hundred large wooden boats dedicated to transporting Qing stone through Taihu Lake to Suzhou, Jiaxing, and other places, as raw materials for making lime. There are three lime kilns in the area, with nearly 500 workers). Donghu Town has coal mines (the town has two coal mining companies, Baocheng and Baoshan, which are currently under military management. Most of the products are transported to Suzhou for the power plant's needs. The founder, Luo Gantang, has a history of more than 20 years. There are nearly a thousand workers now). The silkworm breeding industry on the mountain is also quite developed. (To be continued)</p>

However, capable personnel from the original office will be selected by the County Administration Office for continued employment. After receiving the order, the Police Bureau has ordered the County Police Office to promptly transfer all documents and handled matters clearly by a set date.

<p>The case of Wang Maoting, Han Huaqing, and others colluding with Ge Libaofu, president of the "Russian General Association" at 147 Weihaiwei Road, to privately establish a gambling den, gather crowds to gamble, and attempt to bribe Li Guohua, the director of the New Chengfen Branch in charge, with 300,000 yuan, has been cracked by the Municipal Police Bureau. Wang, Han, Ge, as well as 174 staff members and gamblers, along with a large amount of gambling paraphernalia and money, were arrested.

<h3 id="e24">Construction Bureau to Re-inspect Vehicles <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau will directly handle matters related to water and electricity machinery, advertisements, construction, house repairs, etc. in the future. When applying for the above matters, please contact the relevant departments of the Bureau on the fourth floor of the Municipal Government Building on Hankou Road.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bureau believes that many of the rickshaws and pedicabs in the city are old and dilapidated, with damaged bodies, and are still operating on the streets. This is not only detrimental to the appearance of the city, but also has a great impact on the safety of passengers. Therefore, in order to thoroughly rectify this situation, it has been decided to re-inspect all commercial vehicles in the city. This plan is being actively prepared.</p>

<p>Part of Charity Performance Ticket Sales Allocated First</p>
<p>Students from various universities in Shanghai previously organized a charity performance of "Wealthy Clouds" to raise scholarship funds for this newspaper. Because some ticket sales revenue has not yet been cleared, the accounts have been temporarily suspended from settlement and announcement. However, in order to issue supplementary book and supply subsidies to all students, which will cost a total of ten million yuan, and the remaining scholarship funds are insufficient, the accounting section of the "Student National Covenant for Scholarships" allocated 1.5 million yuan each time. The rest will be cleared and allocated once the accounts are settled.</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday</p>
<p>Ticket sales revenue from the Shanghai university students' charity performance of "Wealthy Clouds" (first installment) 1.5 million yuan, Zhu Shaoyun (Ziyun Scholarship) 182,260 yuan, Helai Fengqin School charity concert 37,200 yuan, Yao Benyuan, director of the Changning Road Police Branch, 18,000 yuan, Qingfangji 10,000 yuan, Zhengchangxiang Yanliaohao Yu Binggang 5,000 yuan, Wang Chaobin 3,000 yuan, Xiao Boqi 2,500 yuan, Pan Juweng 1,400 yuan, Tongyintang Tang 1,000 yuan, Ye Moudi 500 yuan, Zhou Dingzhi 200 yuan.

<h3 id="e27">The Shanghai General Post Office During Wartime <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>The General Post Office on North Sichuan Road is the main hub for the transfer of mail in Shanghai. Before the war, 160,000 to 200,000 letters were distributed from here to the world every day; even in a very small village or town, letters with the Shanghai postmark could be found. But now, at most, there are only 70,000 to 80,000 letters. The post office has the important mission of conveying news for millions of people, so any negligence or slackness in its work will have a serious impact.</p>
<p>The economic situation of the post office is currently very difficult. The main reason, of course, is that there are fewer people sending letters than before, and the increase in postage rates cannot keep up with the general rise in prices. Of course, there are many other reasons that are not known to outsiders.</p>
<p>The salaries of post office employees are paid three times a month. The lowest salary is 24,000 yuan, and the highest is only 40,000 yuan. This amount is clearly insufficient to maintain a normal life for a family. Therefore, the families of postal assistants and postal workers have to eat corn flour, sweet potatoes, and drink thin porridge. They are living a poor life. The "iron rice bowl," which used to be envied by everyone, is no longer admired. As a result, some employees have changed careers, some are "waiting for orders at home," and some have died of poverty and illness. The Bureau is no longer hiring new people. The post office employees have no welfare organizations at all. Only those who reach the age of sixty and retire receive a pension of 200,000 yuan, but how can every employee enjoy this right!</p>
<p>Due to the heavy pressure of life, employees are always thinking about rice, firewood, oil, and salt when they work, which affects work efficiency. Because postmen are not often checked or harassed by the military police, some of them often do small business, or transport rice, noodles, coal balls, etc. for others. Therefore, the people who clear the mailboxes sometimes cannot collect the mail on time, and the distribution of mail may wait until personal matters are completed. Some sorters inevitably lack the energy to work, which affects the speed of delivery. However, there is another reason why letters are received later in this city, and that is inspection. Currently, out of the 40,000 to 50,000 letters sent out by the General Post Office every day, more than 10,000 are selected for inspection. This kind of inspection is of course very necessary during wartime, but it will delay the mail by three or four days, and sometimes up to a month. In the past, all letters were stamped with a "inspection stamp" after inspection, but this procedure is now less common.</p>
<p>If the treatment of post office employees is not improved, and if transportation tools such as boats and vehicles do not run on time, the phenomenon of delayed delivery will naturally not be improved in a short time.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Shipping Lines Resumed Yesterday - Fares Remain Unchanged <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The shipping lines navigating the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were suspended last week due to unforeseen circumstances, have reportedly resumed operations yesterday (the 13th), according to sources in the Shanghai shipping industry. The Xin Ningshao Wheel navigating to Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang, and the Zhejiang Maru, Hana Wheel, etc. navigating to Chongming in northern Jiangsu, returned to Shanghai one after another the day before yesterday. It is reported that the ships departing today (the 14th) include the Wansheng Wheel (to Ningbo) and the Yutong Wheel (to Chongming in northern Jiangsu), and the fares remain the same.</p>
<p>Shipping Administration Bureau Establishes Offices</p>
<p>In order to expand the scope of shipping administration management, the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Construction has established offices in the following locations: Wuhu County, Anhui Province; Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province; Ningbo County, eastern Zhejiang; Zhenjiang County, Jiangsu Province; and Tianshenggang, Nantong County, northern Jiangsu. It is understood that each office will be in charge of all shipping administration registration and tax collection matters.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Post Office Strictly Prohibits Extortion <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that due to the low salaries and difficult living conditions of postal workers in this city, they intend to collect a certain amount of handling fees from recipients when delivering letters. Yesterday, the local postal authorities stated that they have heard of the rumors. While it is true that the living conditions of postal workers are difficult, the Bureau has reported the situation to the highest postal authorities and requested a further adjustment to employee salaries, which is currently being actively considered. However, if employees solicit additional fees when delivering mail, it is a clear act of dereliction of duty, which not only violates postal regulations, but also violates the criminal law. The Bureau has issued a notice to all employees to this effect and instructed all supervisors to pay attention to this matter at all times. It is hoped that the public will assist the Bureau. If they encounter any instances of extortion, they should strictly refuse and record the postal carrier's number and inform the Bureau so that it can be dealt with strictly.</p>
