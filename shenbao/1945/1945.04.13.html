<h3>冲繩島首里北方激鬥　日軍施猛烈反攻　名護灣登陸美軍損害重大</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　冲繩島首里北方之日美戰鬥，愈益激烈，日軍反攻亦頗猛烈。十日晚日軍全綫實行斬殺戰術，搗亂敵陣後方，其戰果現正調查中。敵軍於十一日晨在日軍陣地前增加兵力，嗣以坦克車。鐵甲車反復來襲，日軍每次加以反擊，粉碎敵軍攻勢，戰綫與昨日無大變化。又在北部名護灣登陸之美軍五千人，遭日軍猛烈射擊，以致擊毀坦克車三十五·鐵甲車二·汽車五·發電車一·傷亡兵士多人，又燃料·子彈·糧秣堆積處七所起炸，日軍損失極少。本島北中兩飛機場，已入敵軍手中，敵自三日下午以來，企圖使用該機塲，有小型機若干架起飛，日軍南方主要陣地轟炸該機塲，制壓敵軍行動，目前依然限制其使用。在津堅島登陸之敵軍約有兩大隊，日守軍奮戰殺敵，予以大損失。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據情報，冲繩島牧湊機塲東方嘉數山之戰鬥，兩日來仍未決定勝敗，日軍現已拋棄守勢，其在七千碼戰綫內任何部分被美軍佔領時，日軍即實行反攻，奪取陣地。首里日軍隨時赴援，日軍在戰綫之兵力達一師團以上。又在牧湊與和宇慶町之間，日軍建築堅同陣地，據美軍專門家謂，此種陣地，極為奇妙，其高度之熾烈化，從未所見。該地日軍裝備之强力自動火器，頗有訓練，　里周圍滿裝大砲，臼砲及遠近兩用之砲，防禦敵重進擊。又日軍使用　擊砲之技術，益令人人驚嘆，例如美第七師團之某區域，五分鐘內曾受第三發之砲擊。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據此間接到情報，冲繩島美軍以第二十四兵團企圖攻擊那　，現邶覇北方日軍，正向該地美軍轟擊中。據美第十軍副參謀長史密斯談，太平洋之某砲兵部隊，在冲繩島援助地上部隊，其使用程度已達最大限度。北方地區美軍為第三海兵團，由戰艦，巡洋艦等援護該部隊，然屢次被日軍砲火所阻，未獲前進，而西海岸之美第二十四兵國，現在那覇北方數英里之地點。</p>
<p>南西羣島某基地十二日中央社電　日特別攻擊隊，十一日下午七時至八時，攻擊　集於冲繩本島四周之敵艦船集團，為淸至少轟況巡洋艦一艘，目下尙在繼績攻擊中。</p>
<p>南西羣島某基地十二日中央社電　過去數日來氣候極為惡劣，南西海械自十一日晨以來，天氣逐漸晴朗，雙方攻勢再趨熾烈，十一日冲繩四周有敵方戰艦五艘，巡洋艦十五艘至二十艘，驅逐艦四十艘至四十五艘，運輸船一百十艘至一百三十艘，登陸用運輸船二百艘左右。又在冲繩本島東方，有以空母二艘為主力之敵機動部隊蠢動，東南方亦有以空母三艘為主力之機動部隊活動。</p>
<h3>緬甸戰綫　日軍出擊</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地十二日中央社電　敵軍進抵梅克鬼神拉後，急於確保後方接濟路綫，對於明格，泰文泰與梅克迭拉間之公路及明格，賓賓與梅克迭拉間之公路，更傾力着手修築。該方面日軍部隊隨時出擊，使敵受嚴重威脅，四月四日夜，向賓賓附近敵陣實行大規模突擊戰，獲得大戰果。同時，阿拉干山脈兩側之敵軍，急於炯馬伊，泰文格浦小路南下，該方面日軍在泰文格浦北方十公里格蘇特附近阻遏敵軍，與之交綏。</p>
<h3>日高松宮殿下奉命　參拜神宮祈求勝利　鈴木首相勉國民作戰到底</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日皇陛下為祈求勝利，安渡國難，特派高松宮殿下代表參拜神宮，高松宮殿下本旨後，率同隨員，於七日下午十時二十四分搭　品川站開出之火車，八日上午九時十四分安抵宇治山田站，旋赴內宮　館受齊威，九日上午七時詣豐受大神宮禮拜，奏上疏文後退出，繼即參拜大賀宮，上午十一時詣皇大神宮參拜，十一時四十分返齋館，高松宮殿下完成重大使命，下午七時十分在宇治山田站啟程，十日上午六時三十七分安返東京，又鈴本首相發表談話如左：</p>
<p>日皇陛下　命高松宮殿下代表參拜神宮，為臣者拜察聖心，恐懼感激萬分，吾一億國民應同完成戰爭之惟一目標挺進，作戰到底，以安聖心。</p>
<h3>日海軍兩部隊　奮戰得感狀　呂宋島北部戰况慘烈</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日海軍省頃發表稱：海軍大尉西村幸雄指揮之第〇〇隊及海軍大尉水谷弘康指揮之第〇〇隊，前在馬尼刺地區戰役，驍勇善戰述十數日，始終固守陣地，奉令轉鋒後，即突破重圍，完成任務，茲由聯合艦隊司令長官授與感狀。</p>
<p>呂宋島前綫十二日中央社電　北部呂宋戰綫　克拉薩克山嶺正面之敵軍，目下增强兵力，日軍拚死予以擊退，戰况極呈慘烈。日軍於六日反攻侵入山嶺西北方高地之敵軍，至七日敵增援兵力將高地又加奪取，划於其他日軍陣地，或包圍據點，或進入日軍陣地間隙。出現於山嶺東方之敵軍，以迫擊砲六門至八門猛轟日軍陣地，日軍將士實行挺身突擊，具正展開激戰中。該方面由日軍部隊傾力死戰，現火器雖受損甚重，彈藥缺乏，但士氣極為旺盛，反覆以肉彈衝殺，在某一陣地以四十人多數軍隊包圍敵軍七百名，日軍增援部隊亦已逐漸加入戰綫，不間在山嶺斜坡或溪谷間，依然奮戰不斷。</p>
<h3>接近蘇門答臘英機動隊受創</h3>
<p>南方基地十二日中央社電　英國機動部隊，十二日晨接近北都蘇門答臘，經日軍邀擊，頃查明戰果，除擊落敵機二架外，並被日陸軍特別攻擊隊擊毀驅逐艦一艘及艦載機四架。</p>
<h3>B29型機襲東京福島</h3>
<p>東京十二日申央社電　馬里亞納基地B29型敵機約一百五十架，十二日上午十時許侵入東京西北部及靜岡地區，施行轟炸，歷時約二小時，其一部份復侵入福島，茨城地方行動，日制空部隊奮勇攻擊，獲得相當戰果，詳一細情形尙在調查中。</p>
<h3>日蘇中立條約　不延長意義</h3>
<p>中央社訊　蘇聯外交人民委員莫洛托夫，四月五日通知日大使佐籐，一九四一年四月十三日簽訂之日蘇中立條約予以廢止，該通知係根據條約第三條規定，該條約（有效期間五年）將於明年四月三十五日滿期。此次蘇聯表示滿期後無意再行繼續，據該條約規定，如滿期之前一年，即今年四月二十五日，其中一國不通知廢止，比條約繼續有效五年，換言之，即可展延至一九五一年為止，故蘇方此次通知，意思是無意從一九四六年起至一九五一年之再予延長，並非謂現行條約立刻廢止也，有效期常至明年四月二十五日截止，此點吾人應予重視者。</p>
<p>關於此次蘇方通知，敵方利用為種種宣傳之根據，或臆測此與日本內閣改組有若干關係，或對日蘇關係隨意下判斷，凡此均足表示敵方對戰局推移咸抱憂急，何以言之，蓋日本改組內閣，目的在求更强力之內閣出現，與廢止條約之通知，固全無關係也。再就今後日蘇關係，日方表示雖然蘇方已通知廢止，但仍盡最大努力，維持日蘇中立條約，此點更值得重視者。日本鈴木新內閣，與以前之小磯內閣同樣推行最賢明的現實政策，雖然在今日亦不能預料日蘇關係將有急轉約時報消息，英美方面在克里米亞會議時，似已對通知廢止日蘇條約與蘇聯瞳相約定，但此種約定是有關東亞之某重要區域，而彼等未曾與渝方商量一句，即自作主張，此可見英美之輕視渝方，並英美間似亦意見發生對立，並可明白英美處處為博得蘇聯之歡心，而採取不合理的行動。然則英美為何如此遷就蘇聯，實因戰局不能順利進展，彼等內部蘊藏重大弱點之故，蓋美國因戰局日趨長期化，國內將充滿厭戰空氣，勞資糾紛，罷工事件，影響戰時生產，且人力資源不足亦成顯著事實。對於日本目前時局不能作過低評價，但敵方之困苦隨戰局進展日益加甚，敵方陣線每起具體的問題，則必起混亂，而此正可使日本在大東亞戰中獲得最後勝利。</p>
<h3>冲繩島作戰　為决戰中决戰　松島部長闡述戰况</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部常會，於昨日下午舉行，到松島部長松本大尉及各報記者多人，由松島部長闡述琉球及冲繩島戰况，敵美已遭受非常重大之損失，並稱冲繩島之戰事，實為決戰中之決戰，關係　重。茲誌演詞槪要如左：</p>
<p>琉球敵艦陷於混亂</p>
<p>在琉球列島活動之英美機動部隊，共有五羣，自五日以來，由於日本陸海航空部隊之猛烈攻擊，其三羣已遭消滅，所餘二羣，受到嚴重打擊，其中一部份，刻尙在琉球列島周圍蠢動，截止四月九日止，日方所得之戰果，計沉破敵人艦船二百九十三艘，且均係戰鬥艦艇，故其所受之打擊，實異常嚴重，當時因多雲霧，天氣不良，日本艦隊所發揮之威力，只及幾分之一，但已能獲得如此大戰果。昨今二日，天氣恢復良好，日軍從容等待殲敵良機，予敵人以嚴重打擊。目下敵軍，已陷於混亂狀態。</p>
<p>冲繩日軍堅守陣地</p>
<p>冲繩島周圍所得見之敵人艦船，計戰艦四，五艘，巡洋艦四，五艘，驅逐艦數艘，運送船五十至六十艘，登陸用舟艇四十至五十艘。在冲繩島陸上作戰之敵軍，分為南北二軍，北軍係第三海兵團，南軍為陸上第二十四集團算，七日傍晚北軍在名護附近登陸之步兵為五千人，戰車一百輛，日軍對來製之敵人，予以重大打擊，巳將其戰車之半數消滅，此方面之敵人遭據守堅固陣地之日軍痛擊，已陷入苦戰之中。</p>
<p>雙方作戰激烈異常</p>
<p>據南戰線敵人發表，距離首里二英里，此訊不確，實則第一缐在津覇南線敵人遭據守堅固陣地之日軍打擊，驚惶失措。十一日聯合軍將校在舊金山廣播稱：「日軍防禦陣異常堅固，為世界上第一强有力有組織之防禦陣地。」同時美國步兵將校稱：「日軍所用之砲，為前此未用之大砲。」敵人因日軍砲火猛烈，已將北線第三海兵隊所用之大砲移至南線，攻擊日軍。據敵方第一軍副參謀長史密士（O.P.Smith）云：「現已利用最强大之砲兵，每一碼地區中所用之大砲，已達世界最高限度。」敵人雖運用如此强大之砲火，但攻擊遲遲，並無發展，其所遭受之打擊及出血，實為空前未有之大損失。美國新聞記者亦發表從飛機上所見到搬運死傷者之担架，有若潮水擁來。敵人更稱巳利用飛機搬運死傷兵士，雙方作戰之激烈可以想見。常變方爭奪一五五米高地時，反復搏鬥，異常激烈，但結果此高地仍為日軍所控制。故今後數日間之戰况，可說含有非常重大之意義。敵方之機動部隊，已陷入苦戰之中，而將來陸上遝輸及後方補給，當更為艱難也。</p>
<p>渝美空軍行動消極　　大陸方面最近駐渝美空軍活動，殊為消極，惟一部會　對揚子江華南沿海及津浦錢一帶，仍實行空襲，日方受損極微。最近日軍佔據老河口，此地為渝軍在華北華中間活動上之極重要地區，今為日軍佔領，實為一重要之戰績。</p>
<p>冲繩作戰關係重大　　最後松島部長將敵人對冲繩島作戰之意義申說如下：敵人對冲繩島作戰與對硫黃島作戰一樣，希望在接近日本本土之地域上，建築飛機塲，如果此戰而成功，敵人即擬以此島與硫黃島同時作為其空軍基地，對日本本土作更猛烈之轟炸，並對中國大陸及與接近日本本土之地區，作進一步之攻擊。現在日軍在此地已抱殲滅敵人之決心，堅强作戰，如日軍能予敵人以徹底之打擊，則在大東亞作戰上，勢必造成一新階段。故我人敢說冲繩島之作戰，實為決戰中之決戰。日軍在此戰役中，已對敵人予以極嚴重之打擊，獲得赫赫戰果，此為今後作戰入於勝利之途之前奏，意義殊為重大也。</p>
<p>參加英艦遭受重創　　參加冲繩島作戰之英國戰艦究有若干，雖不清楚，但其「喬琪五世」及「光輝」號兩艘，實已參加其中作戰，且敵方亦承認「喬琪五世」並其他艦船遭受損害之打擊，故換言之英國之首腦艦船，其遭受之打擊，殊為嚴重也。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>日蘇中立關係及其前途</h3>
<p>本月五日，蘇聯通知日本，日蘇中立條約於明年四月滿期後，不再延期。談日蘇關係，原是極複雜的。自從日蘇中立條約成立以後半年內，國際情勢急劇變化，尤以德蘇戰爭之爆發，英美蘇成立同盟，及日本對英美宜戰等事發生，可是，日蘇中立條約的精神，始終不為所動。特別是在去年三月三十日，又有日蘇漁業條約繼續五年和關於北樺太利權移讓的兩種議定書成立，使日蘇聞的中立關係更加穩定，而在政治上對於敵方的謀略宣傳，給予一大打擊。</p>
<p>現在蘇聯通告廢止該約，係根據該約第三條：「本條約於兩締約國批准之日起實施（按批准日期為一九四一年四月二十五日），有效期閒為五年，在滿足上述期間之一年前，如兩締約國任何一方均不通告廢棄本約，則本約將自動繼續延長至五年」。所以，第一，這次蘇聯的通告廢約，是根據條約規定的平常外交行為，不足驚奇；第二，蘇聯雖通告廢止該約，但其有效期間尙有一年，並非即時中止；第三，在未來一年內，國際局勢之變化必非今日所可想像，在日蘇兩國間實際需耍之下，今後未始無另行締結友好條約的可能。</p>
<p>其次，蘇聯通告廢約以來業已一週，雙方輿論平靜如常，因此，敵方英美，除了指出此舉「具有重大政治意義」外，亦無從過甚其詞。道與德蘇關係轉變時情形逈然不同，可見日蘇關係決不有重大變化。同時，日本新任外相東鄕氏，曾於一九三九年任駐蘇大使，對於當時險惡極點的日蘇關係？會以諾門罕事件為中心，與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫往返折衝，打開白蘇國交的出路，為其後松岡莫洛托夫簽訂中立條約開闢坦道，現復受任外相，必能發揮其才能，而有助於日蘇友善。</p>
<p>况且，蘇聯苦戰已近四年，國力損耗至鉅，姑不論今後歐戰的推移如何，在事實上亦決不能將國家為孤注，適中英美帝國主義者之鬼計，這是凡稍知蘇聯歷史及國策者所可瞭然的。今日之通告廢約，無非以一年後的支票，交換不久在舊金山會議中的實際權利而已。</p>

<h3>泰一瞥</h3>
<p>— 黃義</p>
<h3>蘇北政治經濟中心</h3>
<p>泰　舊稱泰州，自昔即為蘇北文化商業中心。前曾兩主江蘇省政之韓國鈞氏，即該系之海安鎮人。現任南京監察院密計部長夏奇岑氏，亦為藉　該系之著名人物。事變前，東台，與化，熙城，阜　四系農產物，均以泰系為策散地，而上海運來蘇北之貨物，亦多先卸泰與第馬之口岸鎮，再行運送泰系，轉輸各地。口岸距泰系僅三十六裡，有汽車，人力車等交通工具，極為發達，水程航路，亦甚便利。過去與鎮江，揚州，與化，高陲，實應，東台，　城，海安等地，胥有定期小輸往來行駛，故經營旅館業者，有四五十家之多，亦蘇北各系中罕有之現象也。</p>
<p>事發後，泰系以非軍事要　，不獨未受戰禍，且因戰事延長而愈益畸形繁榮，其中殆亦有故：第一：鄰近各系如東與　阜均曾　受兵災之慘，人民不勝濫軍遊匪之厭迫，相　離鄉別井，避難泰系。第二：前第一集團軍總司令李長江，在泰系事部參加和運，七邑不驚，秋毫無犯，避亂者更視為榮土，不欲返其故鄉。第三：前去蘇北行營及現在第二方面軍總司令部，均設置於該系，仕宦往來，文武聚巢，戰　有成為蘇北政治中心之趨勢。集此三因，再益以過去商業上舊有之繁榮，及事變以來之特殊發展，泰系竟成為蘇北今日之惟一首府矣！</p>
<h3>鎮泰交通及沿途經過</h3>
<p>記者此次前往泰系，取道鎮江，由鎮去泰，本可先乘小轎至口岸，再行搭汽車往泰，但以小轎停駛，乃改渡江至揚州蜀之六圩，幸事先得鎮江黃系長香谷潘秘書其2　之盛意，派警護送，故常在江邊下馬頭通過大檢問所時，得免盤查之麻煩。輪行約一刻鍾，即已抵六圩，旋聚木炭小汽車赴泰，車可容八人，車價共十四萬元，如個人單乘，約須兩萬元。六圩距揚州僅十八裡，揚州距泰系計九十裡，車於晨九時起行，約三小時始抵宜陵鎮，過一時橋，旅客下車步行，橋旁有日本警備隊駐防，忽來著黑色制服之警察二人，聲稱檢查，實索小費，並佯稱系奉東洋先生之命，態度甚為兇狠，間車旅客無奈，各予以百元券一紙，始悻悻而去。</p>
<p>車過宜陵後，忽拋錨中途，等待修理，乃興同車旅客問談，旅客中半屬泰系商人，謂拋錨地點為系蜀之彭家莊，前為張家莊，距系城尚有十餘裡，彭張二莊皆甚富庶，聚族而居，彭姓中一富戶，有田五千畝，張姓中一富戶，有田兩萬畝，均蜀大地主，以不堪苛捐之剝削，及新四軍之騷擾，避往上海。並謂去年今日，此處為新四軍出沒之地，每每潛伏公路兩側，　　來往行旅，受害者日有所聞，而駐軍長官中有绰号王老虎者，紀律不甚緊張，往民多敢怒而不敢言。現則　軍**師熊團移防此間，軍紀甚佳，　堡堅固，故行旅尚稱安　云。</p>
<p>車經修現完竣，始再前進，下午三時抵泰系明江路車站，有軍警督察處之執法隊來檢查，經示以本報記者名片後，即行放行。乃忽有一**事稅局之檢查員，見記者行李許多，堅欲開　觀視，態度亦極獰惡，益以普通商人視餘，示以名片亦不省，乃以職官證示之，始鬆手放行。昔人謂：（苛政猛於虎），今始知捐　稅蠢之兇橫，亦猛於虎也。</p>
<h3>稅重商艱民生疾苦</h3>
<p>泰系最熱鬧區域，為北門外大街，商業中心點也，其繁盛不減疾苦，惟間有少數店鋪，門扉緊團，貼紅紙條，上書（本店清理，暫停營業）八字，　其內情，則以捐稅負擔奇重，不得不出請歇業之一途，亦繁盛中稍帶不景氣現象也。此間每一商鋪，有營業，有所得稅，有戰時消費特銳。此外尚須繳納依百分比率攒派之軍政費用，如此捐稅重重，商民無不2辦，繳收所職員　達百人，每日分赴各商鋪查賬，以防偷漏，即業氣純擔者，亦須值百抽十五，稽微之微，可以想見。</p>
<p>此間物價除食米每石三萬三四千元，較　地為低廉外，其他日用品無不高昴，中人五口之家，每日開支非七八萬元莫辦，而依保甲制度所分　之住戶捐，田　　捐，更以家產之　　，定其負擔之重輕，加以每月捐稅之繳納，往往隨物價之增漲而累進，漫無止境，以是人人恆不能定其收支之預算，大有朝不保夕之概！記者此番旅行所得之唯一印象，即蘇北民生困苦已極，昔日中產階級，已為貧苦，而一般平民，苦於生活之重壓，時時有挺而走險之可能，至於地方公正士坤，每多避嫌遠引，或則閉門高踏，以致奸宄橫行，乘時而起，好人側目，嘆可如何，長此以往，是亦蘇北社會一在　　,盼當局極加注意。</p>
<h3>記者例會改明日舉行</h3>
<p>市宣傳處主持之第十二次記者例會，本定十三日上午十時半舉行，請警察局第三處長李時雨出席報告，茲以李處長今日須主管處務會職不　出席，宣傳處特將記者例會改於十四日上午十時仍在市府會議室舉行。</p>
<h3>麥粉評定征稅估價</h3>
<p>財政部稅務署以麥粉統稅率部令改為從價征收，現將條例陳奉國府明令修正公佈，定於四月十日起實施。關於麥　完稅價格，茲經照章評定，計麥粉每袋二二至二三公斤者四千元，麥皮二十八公斤者四百元，五六公斤者八百元，均照定章值百征五。</p>
<h3>傳染病患者送隔離醫院</h3>
<p>本市衛生局規定對所有傳染病患者應送南市，悒西，緊田路，長安路及北海路等市立隔離醫院診療，但一部份私立醫院，仍有收容傳染病患者，不特有達規定，抑且極為堪處，本市衛生當局業於日前通知各私立醫院通辦。</p>
<h3>市財局製發　商店專專用發票　四月十五起一律實行</h3>
<p>市財政局為整頓稅收，預防流　起見，對於市內各商店代征零售物品消費特稅，訂定旗用發票規則，並製定零用發票一種，發交各區分征所轉發各商店領用，每本二百張，僅取印製工本費一百七十元，不再另收任何費用，並准於四月十五日起一律實行，倘有延不填用者，將於惩罚。</p>

<p>市宣傳處為防止各戲院劇場准演執照之流弊起見，對前任所發之准演執照，無論已否滿期，概行作廢，自四月十二日起，停止掉換，此後各戲院劇場應照章重行申請領用，以資　　，該處昨已通令所蜀各戲院劇場一體遵照。</p>
<h3>五五青年節　舉行總檢閱</h3>
<p>本市新運分會遵照中央規定，於五月五日青年節，假靜安寺路跑馬認廣場舉行本市青少年團第三三次總檢閱，屈時將由周市長擔任檢閱官，聞該會現已開始準備積極進行，並分別各級青年團員報名參加。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles North of Shuri on Okinawa Island: Japanese Forces Launch Intense Counterattacks; Heavy Damage to American Forces Landing at Nago Bay</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The battle between Japanese and American forces north of Shuri on Okinawa Island is intensifying, with Japanese forces launching vigorous counterattacks. On the evening of the 10th, Japanese forces implemented a full-scale "slashing" tactic, disrupting the enemy's rear lines. The results are currently under investigation. On the morning of the 11th, the enemy forces increased their troops in front of the Japanese lines, followed by repeated attacks with tanks and armored vehicles. Japanese forces repelled these attacks each time, thwarting the enemy's offensive. The battle lines remained largely unchanged from yesterday. Furthermore, of the 5,000 American troops who landed at Nago Bay in the north, fierce Japanese fire destroyed 35 tanks, 2 armored vehicles, 5 automobiles, and 1 generator. Many soldiers were killed or wounded, and seven fuel, ammunition, and supply depots were set ablaze. Japanese losses were minimal. The two airfields in the north and central parts of the island have fallen into enemy hands. Since the afternoon of the 3rd, the enemy has attempted to use these airfields, with several small aircraft taking off. Japanese forces bombed these airfields from their main southern positions, suppressing enemy operations and currently restricting their use. Approximately two battalions of enemy troops landed on Tsuken Island. The Japanese defenders fought bravely, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch - According to reports, the battle for Mount Kazu, east of the Makiminato airfield on Okinawa Island, has remained undecided for the past two days. Japanese forces have abandoned their defensive posture. When any part of the 7,000-yard line is occupied by American forces, the Japanese will launch a counterattack to retake the position. Japanese forces from Shuri are providing reinforcements at any time, and the Japanese forces on the front line total more than a division. Additionally, between Makiminato and Waushima Town, Japanese forces have constructed extremely solid fortifications. American experts say that these fortifications are remarkably sophisticated, with a level of intensity never before seen. The Japanese forces in that area are equipped with powerful automatic weapons and are well-trained. The area around Shuri is heavily equipped with cannons, mortars, and long- and short-range artillery to defend against heavy enemy attacks. Furthermore, the Japanese use of mortar techniques is astonishing. For example, one area of the American 7th Division was hit by three mortar rounds within five minutes.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch - According to information received here, American forces, using the 24th Corps, are attempting to attack Naha. Japanese forces north of Gashichan are bombarding the American forces in that area. According to Smith, Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Tenth Army, a certain artillery unit in the Pacific is providing support to ground troops on Okinawa Island to the fullest extent possible. In the northern sector, the American forces are the 3rd Marine Regiment, supported by battleships, cruisers, and other ships. However, they have been repeatedly hindered by Japanese artillery fire and have not advanced. The American 24th Corps on the west coast is now located several miles north of Naha.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the Nansei Islands, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the afternoon of the 11th, from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM, Japanese special attack units attacked enemy ships concentrated around Okinawa Island, sinking at least one cruiser. The attacks are continuing.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the Nansei Islands, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The weather has been extremely poor for the past few days. Since the morning of the 11th, the weather in the Nansei Islands has gradually cleared, and the offensive by both sides has intensified again. On the 11th, there were five enemy battleships, 15 to 20 cruisers, 40 to 45 destroyers, 110 to 130 transport ships, and approximately 200 landing craft around Okinawa. Furthermore, to the east of Okinawa Island, an enemy mobile force with two aircraft carriers as its main force is maneuvering. To the southeast, another mobile force with three aircraft carriers as its main force is also active.</p>
<h3>Burmese Front: Japanese Forces Launch Attacks</h3>
<p>Burmese Frontline Base, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After enemy forces advanced to Meiktila, they are urgently trying to secure their rear supply lines. They are focusing their efforts on repairing the highways between Myingyan, Thazi, and Meiktila, and between Myingyan, Pinbin, and Meiktila. Japanese forces in that area are launching attacks at any time, seriously threatening the enemy. On the night of April 4th, a large-scale raid was carried out on enemy positions near Pinbin, achieving significant results. At the same time, enemy forces on both sides of the Arakan Mountains are urgently moving south along the Kyaukmaung-Taungup road. Japanese forces in that area are blocking the enemy near Kawsut, 10 kilometers north of Taungup, engaging them in combat.</p>
<h3>His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu Ordered to Visit the Ise Grand Shrine to Pray for Victory; Prime Minister Suzuki Urges the People to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - His Imperial Majesty the Emperor, in order to pray for victory and overcome the national crisis, specially dispatched His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu to visit the Ise Grand Shrine as his representative. After receiving the Imperial will, His Imperial Highness, accompanied by his entourage, boarded the train that departed from Shinagawa Station at 10:24 PM on the 7th. He arrived safely at Ujiyamada Station at 9:14 AM on the 8th. He then proceeded to the inner shrine and received purification rites. At 7:00 AM on the 9th, he paid homage to the Toyouke Daijingu shrine, recited a memorial, and then withdrew. He then visited the Ōga Shrine, and at 11:00 AM, he paid homage to the Kōtai Jingu shrine. At 11:40 AM, he returned to the Saikan. His Imperial Highness completed his important mission and departed from Ujiyamada Station at 7:10 PM, returning safely to Tokyo at 6:37 AM on the 10th. Prime Minister Suzuki also issued a statement as follows:</p>
<p>His Imperial Majesty has ordered His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu to visit the Ise Grand Shrine as his representative. As a subject, I am deeply moved and grateful for this Imperial concern. Our 100 million people should work together to achieve the sole objective of the war, advancing and fighting to the end, to reassure the Emperor.</p>
<h3>Two Units of the Japanese Navy Praised for Gallantry; Fierce Fighting in Northern Luzon</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Navy Ministry recently announced that the 00th unit commanded by Lieutenant Commander Yukio Nishimura and the 00th unit commanded by Lieutenant Commander Hiroyasu Mizutani fought bravely in the Manila area campaign, holding their positions for several days. After being ordered to change course, they broke through the encirclement and completed their mission. They have been awarded certificates of commendation by the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet.</p>
<p>Luzon Frontline, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the northern Luzon front, the enemy forces facing Mount Karasak are currently reinforcing their troops. Japanese forces are desperately repelling them, and the fighting is extremely fierce. On the 6th, Japanese forces counterattacked enemy troops who had infiltrated the high ground northwest of the mountain range. By the 7th, the enemy had reinforced their troops and retaken the high ground, dividing other Japanese positions or encircling strongholds and entering gaps in the Japanese lines. Enemy forces appearing east of the mountain range are heavily bombarding Japanese positions with six to eight mortars. Japanese soldiers are carrying out suicide attacks, and fierce fighting is underway. The Japanese units in that area are fighting with all their might. Although their weapons have suffered heavy damage and ammunition is lacking, their morale is extremely high, repeatedly engaging in human-bullet attacks. In one position, a large force of 40 Japanese soldiers surrounded 700 enemy troops. Japanese reinforcements are gradually joining the front lines, and fighting continues on the mountain slopes and in the valleys.</p>
<h3>Damage to British Mobile Force Approaching Sumatra</h3>
<p>Southern Base, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A British mobile force approached northern Sumatra on the morning of the 12th. After being engaged by Japanese forces, it was confirmed that two enemy aircraft were shot down, and one destroyer and four carrier-based aircraft were destroyed by Japanese Army special attack units.</p>
<h3>B-29s Attack Tokyo and Fukushima</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Approximately 150 enemy B-29 aircraft from Mariana bases intruded into the northwestern part of Tokyo and the Shizuoka area at around 10:00 AM on the 12th, carrying out bombing raids for about two hours. A portion of them also intruded into the Fukushima and Ibaraki areas. Japanese air defense forces fought bravely, achieving considerable results. Detailed information is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Significance of Non-Extension of Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch - Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov notified Japanese Ambassador Sato on April 5th that the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact, signed on April 13, 1941, would be terminated. This notification was based on Article 3 of the treaty, which states that the treaty (valid for a period of five years) will expire on April 25th of next year. The Soviet Union has now indicated that it does not intend to continue the treaty after its expiration. According to the treaty, if one of the two countries does not notify the other of its termination one year before the expiration date (i.e., April 25th of this year), the treaty will continue to be valid for another five years, extending it to 1951. Therefore, the Soviet notification means that they do not intend to extend the treaty from 1946 to 1951. It does not mean that the current treaty is immediately terminated. The treaty remains in effect until April 25th of next year, and this is a point that we should emphasize.</p>
<p>Regarding this Soviet notification, the enemy is using it as a basis for various forms of propaganda, speculating that it is related to the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, or making arbitrary judgments about Japan-Soviet relations. All of this indicates that the enemy is deeply concerned about the progress of the war. Why do we say this? Because the purpose of the Japanese cabinet reorganization is to create a stronger cabinet. It has nothing to do with the notification of the treaty's termination. Furthermore, regarding future Japan-Soviet relations, Japan has indicated that although the Soviet Union has notified its termination, it will still make its best effort to maintain the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact. This is even more worthy of our attention. The new Suzuki cabinet of Japan is pursuing the same enlightened and realistic policies as the previous Koiso cabinet. Although it is impossible to foresee any sudden changes in Japan-Soviet relations today, news from Reuters indicates that the British and Americans seem to have agreed with the Soviet Union to terminate the Japan-Soviet treaty at the Crimea Conference. However, this agreement concerns a certain important region of East Asia, and they did not consult with the Chongqing government before acting on their own accord. This shows the British and American disregard for Chongqing, and also shows that there are conflicting opinions between the British and Americans. It is clear that the British and Americans are acting unreasonably in every way to win the favor of the Soviet Union. Why are the British and Americans so accommodating to the Soviet Union? It is because the war is not progressing smoothly, and they have major weaknesses within. The United States faces growing war-weariness at home as the war drags on, and labor disputes and strikes are affecting wartime production. Furthermore, the shortage of human resources has become a clear fact. The current situation in Japan should not be underestimated, but the enemy's difficulties are increasing as the war progresses. Whenever concrete problems arise in the enemy camp, confusion will inevitably arise, and this will allow Japan to achieve final victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Battle of Okinawa: A Decisive Battle Within a Decisive Battle; Director Matsushima Explains the War Situation</h3>
<p>The Allied Forces Japanese Fleet Press Department held a regular meeting yesterday afternoon. Director Matsushima, Lieutenant Matsumoto, and many newspaper reporters attended. Director Matsushima explained the war situation in the Ryukyu and Okinawa Islands, stating that the American enemy has suffered extremely heavy losses and that the battle of Okinawa is truly a decisive battle within a decisive battle, with grave implications. The main points of his speech are summarized below:</p>
<p>Enemy Ships in Confusion in the Ryukyus</p>
<p>The Anglo-American mobile forces operating in the Ryukyu Islands comprise five groups in total. Since the 5th, three of these groups have been destroyed by the fierce attacks of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces. The remaining two groups have suffered severe damage. A portion of them are still maneuvering around the Ryukyu Islands. As of April 9th, the Japanese side has achieved the following results: 293 enemy ships sunk or damaged, all of which are combat vessels. The damage they have suffered is extremely severe. At that time, due to cloud cover and poor weather, the Japanese fleet was only able to exert a fraction of its power, but it was still able to achieve such great results. In the past two days, the weather has improved, and the Japanese military is calmly awaiting a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy, inflicting heavy blows on them. The enemy forces are currently in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Hold Their Ground on Okinawa</p>
<p>The enemy ships that can be seen around Okinawa Island include four or five battleships, four or five cruisers, several destroyers, 50 to 60 transport ships, and 40 to 50 landing craft. The enemy forces engaged in land battles on Okinawa Island are divided into two armies: the Northern Army is the 3rd Marine Regiment, and the Southern Army is the 24th Army Corps. On the evening of the 7th, 5,000 infantrymen and 100 tanks landed near Nago. The Japanese military has dealt a heavy blow to the invading enemy, destroying half of their tanks. The enemy in this area is being heavily attacked by Japanese forces holding firm fortifications and has been plunged into a bitter struggle.</p>
<p>Fighting Between Both Sides is Extremely Fierce</p>
<p>According to enemy reports from the southern front, they are two miles from Shuri. This information is inaccurate. In reality, on the front line at the Tsuga South Line, the enemy is being attacked by Japanese forces holding firm fortifications and is panic-stricken. On the 11th, a Joint Forces officer broadcast from San Francisco, saying, "The Japanese defensive fortifications are extraordinarily solid, the most powerful and well-organized defensive fortifications in the world." At the same time, a US infantry officer said, "The artillery used by the Japanese is artillery that we have never used before." The enemy, due to the intensity of Japanese artillery fire, has moved the artillery used by the Northern Line 3rd Marine Brigade to the Southern Line to attack Japanese forces. According to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the enemy's First Army, Smith (O.P. Smith), "We are now using the most powerful artillery, and the amount of artillery used in each yard of area has reached the highest limit in the world." Although the enemy is employing such powerful artillery fire, the attack is slow and has not developed, and the damage and bloodshed they have suffered are unprecedentedly great. American journalists have also reported that from the air, they have seen stretchers carrying the dead and wounded like a surging tide. The enemy has also stated that they are using airplanes to transport the wounded and dead soldiers, so one can imagine the intensity of the fighting. During the battle to seize a 155-meter high ground, the fighting was repeated and extremely fierce, but as a result, this high ground is still controlled by the Japanese military. Therefore, the war situation in the next few days can be said to have very important significance. The enemy's mobile forces have been plunged into a bitter struggle, and land transportation and rear supply will become even more difficult in the future.</p>
<p>Chongqing and American Air Force Actions are Passive</p>
<p>Recently, the Chongqing-based American Air Force activities have been extremely passive. Only a few units have been carrying out air raids on the Yangtze River, the South China coast, and the Jinpu Line area, and the Japanese side has suffered very little damage. Recently, the Japanese military occupied Laohokou. This place is an extremely important area for the Chongqing army's activities in North and Central China. Now that it has been occupied by the Japanese military, it is a significant achievement.</p>
<p>The Okinawa Operation is Highly Significant</p>
<p>Finally, Director Matsushima explained the significance of the enemy's operation against Okinawa Island as follows: The enemy's operation against Okinawa Island, like the operation against Iwo Jima, hopes to build an airfield in an area close to the Japanese mainland. If this battle is successful, the enemy plans to use this island and Iwo Jima simultaneously as their air force bases to launch more violent bombings against the Japanese mainland and further attacks against the Chinese mainland and areas close to the Japanese mainland. Now the Japanese military has resolved to annihilate the enemy here and fight strongly. If the Japanese military can inflict a thorough blow on the enemy, it will inevitably create a new stage in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we dare to say that the operation of Okinawa Island is truly a decisive battle in the decisive battle. In this battle, the Japanese military has dealt an extremely serious blow to the enemy and achieved brilliant results, which is a prelude to the path to victory in future operations, and its significance is very important.</p>
<p>British Ships Participating Suffered Heavy Damage</p>
<p>It is not clear how many British battleships participated in the Okinawa Island operation, but the "George V" and "Illustrious" were both participating in the operation, and the enemy also admitted that the "George V" and other ships suffered damage. In other words, the British flagship suffered extremely serious damage.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan-Soviet Neutral Relations and Their Future</h3>
<p>On the 5th of this month, the Soviet Union notified Japan that the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact will not be extended after its expiration next April. Discussing Japan-Soviet relations is extremely complex. Within six months of the establishment of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact, the international situation changed rapidly, especially with the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the establishment of the Anglo-American-Soviet alliance, and Japan's declaration of war on Britain and the United States. However, the spirit of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact remained unshaken. In particular, on March 30 of last year, the signing of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty for another five years and the two protocols on the transfer of rights and interests in northern Sakhalin further stabilized the neutral relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, and dealt a major blow to the enemy's propaganda and scheming in politics.</p>
<p>Now that the Soviet Union has announced the termination of the treaty, it is based on Article 3 of the treaty: "This treaty shall enter into force on the date of ratification by both contracting parties (according to the ratification date is April 25, 1941), and shall remain in effect for a period of five years. If either of the two contracting parties does not notify the other of its termination one year before the expiration of the aforementioned period, this treaty will automatically continue for another five years." Therefore, firstly, this time the Soviet Union's notification of termination is an ordinary diplomatic act in accordance with the provisions of the treaty and is not surprising; secondly, although the Soviet Union has notified the termination of the treaty, it still has one year of validity and is not terminated immediately; thirdly, the changes in the international situation in the next year will certainly be beyond what can be imagined today. Under the actual needs between Japan and the Soviet Union, it is not impossible to conclude a friendly treaty separately in the future.</p>
<p>Secondly, it has been a week since the Soviet Union announced the termination of the treaty, and public opinion on both sides has been calm as usual. Therefore, the enemy, Britain and the United States, apart from pointing out that this move "has significant political significance," cannot exaggerate too much. The situation is completely different from the situation when the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union changed, which shows that there will definitely not be a major change in Japan-Soviet relations. At the same time, the new Japanese Foreign Minister, Mr. Togo, served as the ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1939. Regarding the then extremely dangerous Japan-Soviet relations, he used the Nomonhan Incident as the center and negotiated with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to open up the way for Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations, paving the way for Matsuoka and Molotov to sign the neutrality treaty. Now that he is reappointed as Foreign Minister, he will definitely be able to display his talents and contribute to Japan-Soviet friendship.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Soviet Union has been fighting hard for nearly four years, and its national power has been greatly depleted. Regardless of how the European War will progress in the future, it is, in fact, absolutely impossible to bet the country on one chance, to fall for the trick of British and American imperialists. This can be understood by anyone who knows a little about Soviet history and national policy. Today's notification of termination is nothing more than exchanging a check one year later for actual rights in the upcoming San Francisco Conference.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Coordinates Operations: Occupies Nanyang City; American Air Force Retreats from Northwest Base</h3>
<p>Henan Frontline, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the Japanese army units completed the encirclement of Nanyang, a key point of the Fifth War Area, they began a general attack on the morning of March 30th, coordinating with the fierce artillery fire of friendly forces, gradually approaching Nanyang's northern and enemy fortifications. The vanguard of the Japanese army, which occupied the outer city that evening, entered the city from the west at zero hours on the 31st. The follow-up troops broke through the main gate at 4:20 AM, and other friendly troops also carried out night raids by moonlight, suppressing the resistance of the enemy in the north and west, and killing their way into the city. From 9:00 AM, they began to mop up the remaining enemy troops in the city and completely occupied it by noon. It has been investigated that since last autumn, the enemy has actively defended Nanyang, dispatching the 43rd Division, the most elite unit of the 68th Army, to take charge of the defense, and deploying a large number of field and mountain artillery to attempt a stubborn defense. On the 24th, they ordered the residents within five kilometers around Nanyang to evacuate. Before the Japanese army launched a general attack, they had suffered considerable damage due to Japanese artillery fire and bombing, but they sternly rejected the Japanese army's surrender and were determined to defend Nanyang to the death. However, after the Japanese army began its general attack, it was occupied by the Japanese army in just one night.</p>
<p>Counter-Offensive Strategy on the Mainland Suffers Setback</p>
<p>Mainland Base, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the Japanese army occupied Laohokou, the Northwest forward base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, on the 11th, the enemy's strategic movements were completely shattered, and the strategic attempt of the US-Chongqing joint army to launch a general counter-offensive against Japan was also frustrated. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing previously lost the Guilin base while fighting in Hunan and Guangxi provinces. After the Suiyuan base was occupied in January, the only forward base it relied on was to seek it in the northwest. Therefore, it was still quite diligent in rebuilding and strengthening the engineering. The Ankang, Wenzhou, and Liangshan Northwest bases are all located in the rear, and Laohokou's position as a forward base is becoming more and more important. The enemy then mobilized a part of the tank force from Chengdu or Kunming, and dispatched P41 and P40 fighter planes from time to time to attack Nanjing, Shanghai and other cities, attack railway facilities such as the Pinghan Line and the Jinpu Line, or attack ships on the Yangtze River, attempting to cut off the Japanese side's supply lines. After being heavily attacked and annihilated by the Japanese army this time, its sphere of attack has retreated 200 to 300 kilometers towards Xi'an and Hanzhong. Its ambition to disrupt the rear from the Northwest base has been frustrated. At the same time, the US Air Force's plan to attack Japan has to be changed. This will also have a serious impact on the US-Chongqing joint military's general counter-offensive against Japan on the mainland.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Minister of Propaganda Zhao, speaking to visiting reporters, said: "Freedom of speech is a right that the people should enjoy and is a policy promoted by the government. The resolutions of the People's Representative Conference are of great concern to the government and are always given attention. As for guidance theories, this is another matter. Since there is an established national policy to follow, the so-called guidance work is merely a technical issue of implementing national policy. The ministry has always fulfilled its responsibilities in a timely manner."</p>

Regarding the above matter, the US government is currently in communication with the Swiss government, which has informed the Japanese government. According to investigations, the ship, which had been guaranteed safe passage by the US government, was carrying relief supplies to American prisoners of war and detained Americans in the South Seas and disappeared on its way home. The last known location of the ship was in the southern part of the East China Sea.</p>
<h3>Mr. Koiso Appointed Minister of Transport</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - When Prime Minister Suzuki formed his cabinet on the 7th, he appointed Minister of Military Supplies Toyota to concurrently serve as Minister of Transport. However, the Prime Minister had urgently telegraphed Mr. Koiso, the former president of the South Manchuria Railway Company, to serve as the dedicated Minister of Transport.

Prime Minister Suzuki immediately presented the appointment to the Emperor at 10:30 am, and the investiture ceremony was held at 2:00 pm.

<h3>Berlin Threatened from East and West / Vienna Battles Enter Final Stage</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - European War Situation:</p>
<p>Western Front: According to front-line reports, the American troops who reached the Elbe River on the night of the 11th belonged to the Ninth Army. The vanguard reportedly reached the Wilmersdorf area, 13 kilometers north of Magdeburg. Near this area, five kilometers to the south, is a highway that leads directly to Berlin. On the Eastern Front, Soviet troops reached the Küstrin area, only 60 kilometers east of Berlin. With fierce attacks from both east and west, Berlin is under serious threat. The American First Army east of Göttingen, south of the Harz Mountains, crossed Nördehölen and advanced east towards the city, preparing for the battle to capture Mellinghausen. The right wing of the American First Army advancing east from the north of Göttingen joined forces with the Third Army, reaching Koldra, 27 kilometers northeast of Offatt, on the 11th. This location is only 80 kilometers from Leipzig. The American Third Army to the south occupied Coburg. Essen, the central hub of the Ruhr region, appeared to be under the control of the American forces on the 11th.</p>
<p>Eastern Front: The street battles in Vienna have entered their final stage. Currently, the front line in the city is inside the Danube Canal. According to front-line reports, Soviet General Tolbukhin's troops have seized the northwestern part of the Danube Canal and advanced to the area between the canal and the Danube River. German tank units and artillery units in the nearby mountains continue to fight bravely. Elsewhere, a mobile force of Tolbukhin's army is advancing west of Vienna, launching a major offensive with the aim of encircling the Wawa River, 60 kilometers west of Vienna. In addition, Malinovsky's army broke through the northwestern border of Slovakia and crossed the central Moravian Plain from several heights in Hodolin on the 11th.</p>

<h3>Police Bureau Clears Gambling Dens and Uncovers Another Gambling Den / More Than 30 Gamblers Investigated According to Law</h3>
<p>The city police bureau has ordered all branch bureaus to step up investigations to thoroughly eradicate gambling. It is reported that the investigation section of the bureau's third division recently received a tip-off that Chen was running a professional gambling business at Gao Derong's home at No. 34, Lane 24, South Important Road, profiting from commissions. This was illegal. Section Chief Liu Shaokui sent detective Chen Jinsheng to cooperate with officers to surround the premises at 11:30 am on the 10th, arresting more than 30 gamblers and confiscating gambling equipment such as dice cups. They were taken to the bureau for detention. After verification, they will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation according to law.</p>
<h3>Change of Titles for Detectives and Investigators</h3>
<p>Since the appointment of Director Zhou, the city police bureau has been determined to rectify and refresh the organization, reorganize personnel, and establish staffing. Recently, considering that the bureau's original titles of detective, investigator, and agent were inconsistent with central government regulations, it has issued an order to abolish them all and change them to Patrol Officer, Sergeant, and Constable, respectively. They are still allowed to wear plain clothes to show distinction.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Taixing</h3>
<p>— Huang Yi</p>
<h3>Political and Economic Center of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Taixing, formerly known as Taizhou, has long been the cultural and commercial center of northern Jiangsu. Han Guojun, who twice presided over the Jiangsu provincial government, was from Hai'an Town in this system. The current Minister of Secretarial Affairs of the Nanjing Control Yuan, Xia Qicen, is also a well-known figure from this system. Before the Incident, agricultural products from Dongtai, Rugao, Xiyi, and Funing were all distributed through Taixing, and goods shipped from Shanghai to northern Jiangsu were mostly unloaded at the port town of Ditang in Taixing before being transported to Taixing and distributed to various places. Ditang is only 36 li from Taixing and has well-developed transportation such as cars and rickshaws. Waterways are also very convenient. In the past, there were regular shuttle services to Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Rugao, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, and Hai'an, so there were as many as forty or fifty lodging businesses, a rare phenomenon in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>After the Incident, Taixing, as a non-military area, not only did not suffer from war, but also became more and more abnormally prosperous due to the prolonged war. There are probably reasons for this: First, neighboring areas such as Dongtai and Funing had suffered the misery of war, and the people could not bear the harassment of stray troops and bandits, so they left their homes and villages to seek refuge in Taixing. Second, Li Changjiang, the former commander-in-chief of the First Army Group, participated in the peace movement in Taixing and was not disturbed by the seven villages. The refugees regarded Taixing as a glorious land and did not want to return to their hometowns. Third, the former Northern Jiangsu Headquarters and the current Headquarters of the Second War Area are both located in this system. Officials come and go, and military and civilian personnel gather here, making Taixing tend to become the political center of northern Jiangsu. Combining these three factors, coupled with the past commercial prosperity and the special development since the Incident, Taixing has become the only capital of northern Jiangsu today!</p>
<h3>Transportation between Zhenjiang and Taixing and the Journey Along the Way</h3>
<p>The reporter went to Taixing this time via Zhenjiang. From Zhenjiang to Taixing, one could first take a small sedan to Ditang and then take a car to Taixing. However, because small sedans were out of service, I changed to cross the river to Liuwei in Yangzhou. Fortunately, I had the kindness of Secretary Pan of the Zhenjiang Huang system, who sent a police escort, so I was spared the trouble of inspection when I passed the checkpoints on the riverbank. After about a quarter of an hour by wheel, I arrived at Liuwei. Then I took a small charcoal car to Taixing. The car could hold eight people and cost a total of 140,000 yuan. If one rides alone, it costs about 20,000 yuan. The car departed from Liuwei at 9 am and arrived at Yiling Town after about three hours. After crossing a single bridge, passengers got out of the car and walked. There was a Japanese garrison stationed next to the bridge. Suddenly, two policemen in black uniforms came and claimed to be inspecting, but in reality, they were asking for tips, pretending to be under the orders of the Japanese master. They were very fierce in their attitude. The car passengers had no choice but to give them each a hundred-yuan bill before they left grudgingly.</p>
<p>After the car passed Yiling, it suddenly broke down in the middle of the road and waited for repairs. I then talked with the passengers in the car. Half of the passengers were Taixing merchants. They said that the breakdown point was Pengjiazhuang, which belongs to Taixing, formerly Zhangjiazhuang, more than ten li from the city of Taixing. The Peng and Zhang villages are very wealthy, living in clans. One wealthy household in the Peng surname has 5,000 mu of land, and one wealthy household in the Zhang surname has 20,000 mu of land. They are all big landlords. They avoided Shanghai because they could not bear the exploitation of heavy taxes and the harassment of the New Fourth Army. They also said that last year today, this place was where the New Fourth Army frequented, often lurking on both sides of the road, looting passing travelers. Sufferers were heard of every day, and the commander of the stationed army, nicknamed King Tiger, did not have strict discipline, so the people dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Now, the army **师熊团** has moved to this area. The military discipline is very good, and the fortifications are strong, so the journey is still safe.</p>
<p>The car was repaired and then continued forward, arriving at the Mingjiang Road station in Taixing at 3 pm. A law enforcement team from the military police supervision office came to inspect. After showing them the reporter's business card, they were released. Then suddenly, an inspector from the **税务局** saw that the reporter had a lot of luggage and insisted on opening it for inspection. His attitude was also extremely fierce, and he regarded me as an ordinary merchant. I showed him the business card but he didn't pay attention. So I showed him my official certificate and he finally let go. As the ancients said: "A harsh government is fiercer than a tiger." Now I know that the ferocity of tax collectors is also fiercer than a tiger.</p>
<h3>Heavy Taxes, Difficult Business, and Suffering People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>The busiest area in Taixing is North Gate Street, the commercial center. Its prosperity does not reduce the suffering. However, there are a few shops with tightly closed doors, with red paper strips pasted on them, inscribed with the words "This shop is being cleared and temporarily closed." The reason for this is that the tax burden is too heavy, so they have to apply for closure. This is also a slightly sluggish phenomenon in the midst of prosperity. Each shop here has business tax, income tax, and wartime consumption special tax. In addition, they also have to pay military and political expenses levied according to a percentage. With such heavy taxes, merchants and people have no way to survive. There are as many as a hundred collectors, who go to each shop every day to check accounts to prevent tax evasion. Even charcoal carriers have to pay fifteen out of every hundred. The meticulousness can be imagined.</p>
<p>The prices here, except for rice, which is 33,000 to 34,000 yuan per stone, which is lower than in other places, are all high. A middle-class family of five has to spend 70,000 to 80,000 yuan a day. The household donation and field donation allocated according to the Baojia system are also determined by the amount of family property. In addition, the monthly tax payment often increases with the increase in prices, without end. Therefore, everyone can never fix their budget, and there is a general sense of insecurity! The only impression I got from this trip is that the people's livelihood in northern Jiangsu is extremely difficult. The former middle class has become poor, and the general public is suffering from the heavy pressure of life, and there is a possibility of taking risks at any time. As for the local just gentry, they often avoid suspicion and withdraw, or close their doors and live in seclusion, so that traitors run rampant, seizing the opportunity to rise, and good people sigh helplessly. If this continues, it is also a crisis in northern Jiangsu society. I hope the authorities will pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Reporter's Regular Meeting Rescheduled for Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The 12th reporter's regular meeting hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office was originally scheduled to be held at 10:30 am on the 13th, and Chief Li Shiyu of the Third Division of the Police Bureau was invited to attend and report. However, Chief Li must preside over the division affairs meeting today and cannot attend. The Propaganda Office has specially rescheduled the reporter's regular meeting to be held at 10:00 am on the 14th in the Municipal Government Conference Room.</p>
<h3>Assessment of Taxable Value of Wheat Flour</h3>
<p>The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance changed the unified tax rate for wheat flour to ad valorem tax in a ministerial order. The regulations have now been submitted to the National Government for revision and promulgation, and will be implemented from April 10th. Regarding the dutiable price of wheat, it has now been assessed according to regulations. Wheat flour is assessed at 4,000 yuan per bag of 22 to 23 kilograms, wheat bran is assessed at 400 yuan per bag of 28 kilograms, and 800 yuan per bag of 56 kilograms, all taxed at 5% of the assessed value.</p>
<h3>Infectious Disease Patients Sent to Isolation Hospitals</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau stipulates that all infectious disease patients should be sent to the municipal isolation hospitals for diagnosis and treatment, such as the Nanshi, Yixi, Jintian Road, Changan Road, and Beihai Road hospitals. However, some private hospitals still admit infectious disease patients, which is not only against the regulations but also extremely concerning. The municipal health authorities notified all private hospitals to handle this matter a few days ago.</p>
<h3>City Finance Bureau Issues Special Invoices for Shops / Implemented Uniformly from April 15th</h3>
<p>In order to rectify tax collection and prevent leakage, the City Finance Bureau has formulated rules for the use of special invoices for retail goods consumption special tax collected by various shops in the city.

<h3>Municipal Construction Bureau Formulates Provisional Measures for Registration of Well-Digging Merchants</h3>

<h3>Elementary School Students Continue to Vigorously Donate to Charity School Fund</h3>
<p>The students of Wu Ben Elementary School are deeply moved by the newspaper's free elementary school.

Furthermore, the students of the Third Elementary School of the Ningbo Sojourners' Association, who had previously sponsored the charity school fund twice, continued to donate enthusiastically yesterday. The children's efforts in contributing both money and effort are highly commendable. The letter is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  We are all very moved by the elementary school and (charity school fund) run by your newspaper. Because we can study in school and still have extra money to spend, we are very lucky; so we decided to canvass our friends during the spring break and save our pocket money to donate to your newspaper's (charity school fund) to show our appreciation!</p>
<p>Now, we present the above-mentioned donation savings certificates worth 42,560 yuan, and we have also raised 23,500 yuan, along with 241 old books, totaling 66,060 yuan and 241 old books. We hope that all students in Shanghai will respond and that people from all walks of life will generously donate. Then, we believe this power will be even greater, and all poor children will have the opportunity to study! Sincerely, all the students of Private Wu Ben Elementary School.</p>
<p>2.  Your newspaper's advocacy of the (charity school fund) and the collection of textbooks have received sympathy from people in the community for a month. Recently, we heard that various free elementary schools have already started classes. Seeing the gentle breeze and rain nurturing, we are not frivolous, and we are excited. All the students of our school, in addition to having donated (charity school fund) twice, totaling 42,100 yuan and 723 old books, now make further contributions to continue donating (charity school fund) 13,800 yuan and 373 new books. We hope you will accept them, so that it may be a small contribution to the soil and streams. Sincerely, all the students of the Third Elementary School of the Ningbo Sojourners' Association.</p>
