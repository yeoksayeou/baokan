<h3>中蘇間橫亘小陰影　東北局勢抵迷沉悶　工礦登陸兩事待商討</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕據說；蔣經國連聖誕節也沒得安閒，僕僕風雪，飛往莫斯科去了。如果此訊不虛，那麼他的偉大任務，該是剔除中蘇友情的眼睛裏的一些砂石。第一粒砂石想是工礦，雖然蘇聯政府從來還沒正式提出過，而問題並不是不存在的。依據蘇聯遠東元帥馬林諾夫斯基的觀點，東北的重工業，都是日本的軍事工業，而且還含有很大的對蘇作戰的意味，所以他應當是紅軍勝利的果實，而主持東北經濟的中國官方則認爲，戰利品應當是可以移去的東西，蘇軍認爲戰利品的東西，自可將其運回本國。這個問題，截止到這裏，就沒有再談判過。可是也沒有解決。兩個月內，這個問題像幽靈似的一直投給東北一塊陰影。第二粒砂石，該是大部國軍十月底的未能在大連登陸，連在莫斯科簽字的大員，都感覺非常突然，爲始料所不及。最近，馬林諾夫斯基表示，大連不是他的轄區，不能派連絡官協助接收，也使中國官方陷於極度的迷惑。此外，安東問題也是一粒小小的砂石，蘇方表示也不能協助該地的接收，因爲那裏沒有蘇軍駐守。安東省是富於山嶽和不同國籍人民的戰區，在東北淪陷十四年中，日本一直就沒有確實統治過這個地區。一位相當有地位的人告訴我，如果安東不能順利接收，東北是不能安寗的。所謂砂石或者不僅這些，而僅這些已經使中蘇友情的眼睛刺痛了，大家彼此還不該把他剔除嗎？</p>
<p>〔本報北平二十八日電〕東北局勢宛如瘧疾，寒熱無常。近半週來東北消息又趨沉悶，若干未決問題，或已在極遼遠之國外進行商討。蔣經國行蹤已成此間之謎。目前東北接收工作，似手續，亦尚未商妥。熊式輝在平，似頗悠閑。近三日來，每日邀集三省府人員談作人作事之道，每講話逾二小時。蔣主席雖手令各省主席元旦前到達東北，目前似須稍爲展緩，大多數似將在北平迎接新歲，如一切順利，彼等可望於下月四五號前分九批重返東北。準備空運長春國軍，刻仍在此間待命，第五師長李則芬日前飛錦州謁杜聿明請示機宜，開始空運當不在遠。新六軍副軍長舒適存，前日已抵平，全副美式裝備之新六軍士兵，初次出現北平街頭。</p>
<p>〔本報北平二十九日電〕熱主席劉多荃日前飛錦與杜聿明將軍商談熱河接收事宜，事畢，於昨日飛津，今午返平，準備一切。熱河省府人員由渝抵平者，已四十餘人，廳長中僅敎廳長劉廉克在綏未來，其餘二十餘人將由渝赴滬，循海路北上。平熱路刻僅通石匣，一般判斷，熱省府人員將繞道錦州，隨軍推進入熱。</p>
<h3>我市長雖接收視事　蘇方仍掌握長瀋　國軍西向熱河已克復義縣</h3>
<p>〔合衆社北平三十日電〕目前國府接收長春瀋陽之情形，名義似勝於實際。據接近東北行營方面息：國府所委市長雖已就任視事，長春與瀋陽兩市，實仍在蘇軍掌握。除中國方面之市長，及其少數隨員，與中行之人員外，蘇聯官員依舊各行其是。杜聿明將軍北開瀋陽之部隊，正等待中蘇於新民談判之結果。同時，杜將軍所部，亦西向熱河區伸展，並向東對營口港，繼續施以壓力。據最後軍事方面消息：西向熱河伸展之杜聿明所部，業已克復義縣。義縣乃錦縣進入熱河之鐵路交通中心地，國軍於收復熱河與東北邊境上之金谷門（譯音）後繼續向熱河省伸展。蘇軍官方宣稱，已撤離該處。長春瀋陽等市府，無異「獨人班」，一切重要事務，若警務，交通，運輸等問題，均須依賴於蘇方。該兩處中行，雖已復業，蘇聯軍票仍繼續流通於市面。哈爾濱市長楊綽庵，已於昨日抵任。大連市長，短期內亦將由長飛哈，現正在長待獲蘇方之允許後就任視事。中央所委之市長抵任後，大連哈爾濱兩處之蘇聯當局，仍將行使職權，因在國軍空運到達前，少數之官員，實不足以接收管理云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津三十日電〕聖誕節一週間，華北美軍除在寒風凛冽中，駐守各鐵路綫，及保護自東北開來之運煤專車外，並未遭遇其他狙擊事件。杜聿明所部仍未進駐瀋陽，惟另有中央軍約五千人新自華南乘自由型運輸艦開到葫蘆島。據可靠消息，杜聿明所部，在兩星期內，或尚不能開入瀋陽。而國軍之遲遲未入濟陽，謂癥結仍在蘇聯。各方顯在等待某種決議，以確定將來行動。此外，並將續有中央軍自華南開赴胡蘆島登陸。將來東北將有九軍或十軍之數，歸杜聿明指揮。預料國軍日後開入瀋陽長春及哈爾濱，不致遭遇抵抗。</p>
<h3>美鐵路配備　由伊朗運華　助我國戰後復興</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕國務卿今日宣布：在伊朗之剩餘鐵路配備，約值六百萬美元，已售與聯合國善後救濟總署，以供中國之用。同時，白宮透露稱：在伊朗之美國民航飛機機關及設備，已奉命于明年元旦由陸軍部移交商務部之民用航空管理局，此舉或與美國軍隊於明年初由伊朗撤退一事有關。國外淸理專員麥克浦宣布：原值八百餘萬萬美元之鐵路配備，現在伊朗柯拉姆沙爾，由貨輪十艘與機車運輸輪一艘載往中國，以援助戰後經濟復興，同時可作爲聯合國善後救濟總署之主要運輸工具。所有機車與其他鐵路配備，百分之五十即將運往上海，其餘則運往香港與九龍一帶。此項轉售物品中，並包括燃油機車廿部，低緣車一千五百四十八節，包廂車一千三百七十節，平車四百九十九節，二十噸之車掌車廿四節，鋪路車八部以及重七十五磅之鐵路軌道四萬二千八百尺。</p>
<h3>宋希濓將軍　頒給青天白日章</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化卅日電〕前遠征軍第十一集團軍總司令宋希濂將軍，現任中央軍校第九分校主任，於去年五月間反攻滇西，建立殊勳，國府特頒發靑天白日勳章，以昭功績，頃聞國府蔣主席電派張部長治中，就近代表在迪化頒授，並定於卅五年元旦日舉行。</p>
<h3>張嘉璈一行赴哈　蘇通知臨時市府準備移交</h3>
<p>〔中央社哈爾濱廿九日電〕此間蘇軍當局，已通知哈臨時市府、準備移交。張嘉璈·董產平·王鍾·朱新民·今日下午四時四十五分，於久雪初霽中，專車抵此。楊綽庵及各界代表，均到站歡迎。</p>
<p>〔中央社長廿九日電〕張嘉璈今晨六時十分，專車由瀋陽過長春赴哈爾濱，在此停留三小時後，復登車前進。同行中央銀行特派員王鍾，亦隨往哈市設行。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿八日電〕新任警察局長張烱，今到任視事。前局長劉志格，改任副局長。又財部特派員陳公亮，及第某師參謀長姚葛民等，昨由平飛抵此。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿八日電〕雪後瀋陽，本日室外氣溫攝氏零下五度，較長春之廿二相差十七度之多。張嘉璈原定今日下午一時飛哈，以霧大視綫僅及二百公尺，不利飛行，臨時改於晚七時廿分乘長鐵專軍北行。</p>
<p>〔中央社劉竹舟瀋陽廿八日電〕董文琦市長，廿七日上午十時接收市政時，蘇護城正副司令及由長春蘇軍總部派來之聯絡官，均到塲觀禮。市長首向市府全體職員，各區區長，各校校長等訓話，勉以自動自覺，守紀律，重秩序，愛惜民族名譽，保全地方元氣。並列舉廢苛政，救貧苦，復興產業，安定民生諸端，爲今後施政之準繩。繼由蘇軍司令高夫堂致詞，渠稱：本日爲淪陷十四年之瀋陽市正式歸返中國中央政府統治之日，渠能參加此盛典，甚感榮幸。渠並鄭重聲明，渠在撤退前，決儘最大努力，協助董市長，排除足以妨害市政發展之一切障礙。會後，賓主舉盃互祝中蘇兩國領袖健康。又中行開幕時，蘇軍正副司令亦曾到塲，此間銀行本日開始營業者，尚有中國銀行。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿九日電〕國軍進駐義縣及淸水河後，杜聿明將軍，廿九日曾一度前往視察。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州卅日電〕解放後之東北人士，正以最興奮之情緒，來本接勝利後之第一快樂新年。邇來東北天氣晴朗，錦州市及各縣人民，積極籌備款物，買酒宰豬，慰勞國軍，慶祝元旦。</p>
<h3>蔣主席　今晚廣播</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶卅日電〕蔣主席定卅一日下午七時向全國同胞廣播，由中央·國際兩電台用「一二〇〇」「五九一八」「六一一八」「七一五三」四種千週彼，聯合播送，並由全國廣播電台轉播。</p>
<h3>東北華北需人孔亟　各種工業待專家前往接收</h3>
<p>〔聯合社錦州廿九日電〕戰事之勝利，未必即爲和平之獲得，此可由東北之事，得一有力證明。東九省土地肥沃，寶藏豐富，十四年來在傀儡政府下，受治於日本，今始漸漸由中央政府收復，但日本在該處之經濟勢力，猶未被擊破。當日本控制東北時，預期將有大舉興兵進攻西伯利亞之一日，故迅速進行工業化計劃，廣築鐵道，結果其里程數較中國其他各部所有者合計之尚多。紡織廠亦夥。煤鐵出產旣豐，並有若干油藏。在耕耘數百年之肥沃土地上，工業城市如雨後春筍，突然繁興，此種經濟發展，大多由受有高度訓煉之日本技師組織維持。彼等迄今猶逗留此間，中國因尚無充分人才接替，自亦不得不予留用，否則，各種工廠，俱將閉歇。許多外國觀察家及有見識之華人，俱以爲此種對日人之倚賴，必然將使日人在東北工業界中保持其優勢控制之地位。某要人並稱：「茍聽任日人繼續根留，恐不復能刈除之，其創造力永無止境。彼等勢必趁中國分裂之時，利用每一時機，以自固其地位。」日本外交政策，向以中國分裂爲基調，在數萬日本技師，自恃其才能亦猶如此夢想，俾從中漁利。華北情形亦復相同。工業技師及日本士兵均繼續留用，靑島，天津，北平一帶守護鐵路者，更有美軍五萬者，及僞軍數萬，以防共軍破壞。自秦皇島通至內地之某鐵路綫，有守兵四種，即中央軍，美軍，日軍及僞軍。此鐵路與中英合辦之開灤煤礦相接，上海，北平，及香港之煤斤，咸取給於此。如是情形，美軍對之極爲疑惑不解，因彼等來此時，原告以任務在解除日軍武裝，彼等於六個月前尚在琉球島與日軍血戰，今至中國，則與日軍比肩担任守衛工作，豈非怪事。日軍居於中央軍與共軍之間，可利用之以作緩衝。日人有工業技術者，則可利用之以經營華北工廠。簡言之，敗軍之腦力體力，俱已加以利用。然則問題所在，即是否戰敗後之日人，仍能在東九省及華北，保持其優勢地位。若然，則被僱之日人，仍有作主人翁之機會也。</p>
<h3>甘主席谷正倫　離蘭赴天水　參加寶天鐵路通車禮</h3>
<p>〔中央社蘭州卅日電〕寶天鐵路定元旦正式通車，谷正倫以此次爲甘省空前未有之盛事，特於卅日由蘭乘汽車趕往天水，參加通車儀式。</p>

<p>〔合衆社重慶卅日電〕在莫斯科三强外長會議結束與馬歇爾將軍在渝折衝聲中，共產黨今日推進其政治攻勢，而在軍事方面取觀望態度。國民黨方面，則保持其堅定之政治守勢，以擴充其軍事勢力。雙方對政治協商會議，以及馬歇爾將軍之努力，均寄以極大期待。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>匯率的分級制與限額制</h3>
<p>外匯問題，最爲時人所注目。新匯率又有於元旦公佈之說，市塲更形關切。往昔先令之上漲，祇有金融業和進出口業加以注意，今則一般工商界，乃至一般民衆，亦無不拭目以待。究其所以，並非由於一般人對於經濟興趣之增厚，乃是由於匯率與民生關係之增高。</p>
<p>吾國從前，本爲銀本位的國家，一切物價均隨金銀比價而變動。在金銀比價相當穩定時，一切物價，無論屬於進口貨或出口貨，均相當穩定。其有劇烈變動時，即在國際收支不能平衡時，祗須經過一度的補救，一切物價，亦每每隨之調整，而依舊復歸於穩定的狀態。所以然者，國內物價與國外物價，尚有一共通的標準故。此共通的標準爲何？即是實幣，亦即是金銀的比價。</p>
<p>自從銀幣停止流通，一切鈔票，實際上成了不兌換的紙幣，於是物價與幣值始宣告脫節。然而當時鈔票與英鎊及美元，尚定有比價，即對英匯率定爲一先令二辨士半，且申請相當便利，故鈔票的本身，直接雖沒有價值，間接依舊有價值，而且依舊有一定的價值。所以爾時物價，依舊在相當的穩定狀態中。換句話說：物價對於鈔票，固有密切的聯繫，即國內物價與國外物價，亦依舊有密切的聯繫。在不兌換紙幣時代，國內物價尚不至於劇烈變動，其原因端在於是。</p>
<p>自從沿海口岸被敵寇完全封鎖，物資不能流通，中央銀行的外匯掛牌，又成了有行無市的名義上匯率，所有少數出口匯票及華僑匯款等，又悉數爲中央所統制，於是國內物價，始完全爲鈔票所控制，而與金銀比價完全脫節，與國外物價更完全脫節。又以長期抗戰之結果，基於財政上的原因，鈔票增加，通貨膨脹，而淪陷區域則又加上無可計數的僞幣，於是物價不斷地飛漲，工商業基礎動搖，民生痛苦便與日俱增了。今日一般民衆，所以不約而同地注目於匯價，更不約而同地盼望匯率之從早規定，其着眼點即在於是，並非專爲恢復進出口貿易起見。明白言之：即希望物價與通貨，重新取得聯繫，更與國外物價取得聯繫，從而安定物價，安定工商業，安定民生耳。</p>
<p>上述這稱心理，可說是十分普遍。不但民衆如此希望，便是政府也如此希望。所成爲問題的，就是：這個匯率，究應如何規定？因爲定得太高，就是幣值低落，那麼，在好的一方面說，固然可以（一）剌激企業，（二）促進出口貿易，（三）保護國內工業，（四）獎進一切生產，和（五）减少入超的差額，使國際的收支不至於相差得太遠。然而有利必有弊，同時候，也要招致或加重種種不良的後果。簡單言之：即（一）物價還要高漲，（二）生活還要困難，（三）勞工風潮無法敉平，（四）在此物資枯竭的時候，不易獲得補充，（五）尤其是機器原料及一切必需品的輸入，增加了困難，（六）可能地招致進口國的反感和報復。倘使定得太低，就是幣值提高，那麼，其利害恰恰相反。這其間很不易得到兼籌並顯的方法。</p>
<p>有人主張，不要提高，也不要壓低，就穩定在現時黑市匯價這限度上。從表面上看來，似乎可以减少波動，使物價和生活得漸漸地歸於穩定，而孰知實際上並不盡然。</p>
<p>因爲現在國內外的物價，依舊脫節，並沒有到達調整的地位。照戰前的市價來說，國內目前物價，至少漲起一千倍，而幣值的低落，不過三四百倍。如果照現在的黑市，來穩定外匯的比率，那麼，以外匯訂購洋貨，其成本不及國內物價三分之一乃至什之一二，大家爭定洋貨，勢必源源而來。於是物價尚須大落，民族工業岌岌可危，而各種農產物和原料，也將實逼處此，無法與之競爭。這種現象，現在已經很顯著地擺在我們的面前了！</p>
<p>爲了調和上面這利害衝突起見，於是又有分級規定的傳說，大致分爲四級，即：（一）關於國防工業建設所需機器等類之輸入；（二）駐節國外使領館經費；（三）主要商品；（四）奢侈品。這當然是一種苦心孤詣的辦法，很合理，也是很切實際的辦法。其中最值得注意的，是主要商品即必需品這一級。必需品何以要定得較低？這自然爲是國內所必需，歡迎其進口的緣故。不過，依舊要注意到：（一）是否眞正必需？（二）國內有沒有代用品？和（三）本國有沒有這一類的產品和工業？因爲分級的用意，顯然含有幾分保護的意味在內，倘因必需的理由，而過分地獎進轍入，就要失掉所以分級的效用了。</p>
<p>其次是奢侈品的一級，把匯率定得較高些，就是把他的成本提高些，那是人同此心，決無疑問的。不過要提高到甚麼程度，方可以達到我們預期的目的？這是很值得研究的。通常採取這種手段，不外乎兩種原因：一是由於保護政策的，一是由於財政上的。現在國內的奢侈品工業，還有發展到需要保護的程度，所以提高幣值的原因，無疑地由於財政上的見解，即在於减少外匯資金的浪費。不過吾國人民有一種崇拜洋貨的風尚，其貨愈名貴，愈受人珍視。所以要達到節約外匯的目的，在實行提高的程度度上，也有縝密考慮的必要。</p>
<p>我們以爲除掉分級制以外，不妨進一步，更採用限額制，與分級制相輔而行。即不必要的進口貨，可分類加以數額上的限制。超過此額時，即停止供給其匯票。其不必要的性質愈高，則其限額亦愈嚴。如此辦理，方可以達到上項預期的目的。</p>
<p>吾國本是入超的國家，向來對外貿易，完全取自由主義，以致入超的增加，漫無止境。根據現在國內外物價的差異，進口業躍躍欲試的情緒，與出口貿易停滯的狀態，如果單是規定匯率，不規定限額，吾恐這種入超的潮流，還是無可遏抑，國際借貸的逆勢，也無從加以改善。</p>
<p>我們知道，入超並不是絕對可慮的。原料品，機械，交通用具，文化用具等等的入超，凡足以直接間接提高國內的生產與文化的，毋寗說是有利的。所以我們主張限額，同時主張分級。分級應與限額相輔而行，方不至阻礙以上各種貨物的輸入，同時仍可收到節約外匯的功效。</p>
<p>所謂限額辦法，原有多種：（一）是按國的，即視彼此間商約或貿易的關係，而差別其輸入額；（二）是按額的，即按貨物種別而高下其輸入額；（三）是把（一）（二）兩種混合應用，於按國之外，再行按類區別。我們主張，單純地採用第（二）種辦法，祇按類限制其每年進口的總額，而不問其來自何國。因爲這個問題，雖也有其研究的價值，却不在匯價範圍以內，且易引起種種不良的惡果　故不贅論。</p>

<h3>韓國羣情憤激　反對託管制度　發生罷工罷市形勢極險惡</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城三十日電〕莫斯科會議决定監督朝鮮五年消息傳至此間後，韓人之企求獨立者昨均大譁，現正發生罷工罷市，各街道不時發生𩰚毆，並有以石子擲擊美軍。促成此種暴動，憤恨代管固爲其一種原因，惟左右兩派借端滋事，重起內爭，亦大有關係。美軍當局已於昨夜宣布戒嚴，每晚八時後禁止通行，以防再生意外，惟形勢險惡，更嚴重之紛擾恐仍難免。朝鮮南部美軍司令霍奇中將告當地記者稱，莫斯科會議對朝鮮所决定之監督制，並非立即實行。監督二字極爲此間所不願聞，而霍奇之聲明亦不幸發表太遲，蓋監督五年之消息早已傳遍邇遐，昨日中午罷工罷市即已開始，軍政府中職員悄然離去者數百人，警察亦相率罷崗，各銀行均關閉，咸對外國監督五年憤憤不平，未幾大張標語貼滿各處，指斥監督計劃係出共產陰謀。右派各團體所主持之民衆大會已通過决議，反對外國監督，要求立即承認韓國臨時政府，並飭軍政府全體職員實行罷工。凡反對此項决議之報紙勒令停刋，各政黨一律解散。霍奇仍諄諄告誡各報，謂眞正愛國者，對莫斯科决議，不必憂懼」。</p>

<h3>希特勒　遺囑婚約發見　自願與妻一死以免受辱</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐倫堡三十日電〕美國反諜報人員在英憲兵協助之下，在慕尼黑迤南三十哩處之德國鄕村小屋內，發見衣箱一隻，打開視之，則希特勒之遺囑，希特勒致德人民之政治遺書，及希特勒與伊娃勃勞恩之結婚證書赫然在焉。各項文件之日期，均爲四月二十九日，即紅軍攻陷柏林前三日。美第三軍長特魯斯柯特於宣布此一發見時聲稱，發見之文件中，有若干種尚須繼續調查，目前未便發表。由此種文件可以想像納粹末日之狀態，實具有無從估計之價值，余敢以名譽擔保此項文件之眞實性。英美軍事當局搜索希特勒遺囑已久，該貯藏遺囑之衣箱，係在飽爾曼之副官保斯丁之女友家中床下所發見。</p>

<h3>國土重光國軍推進聲中　廻溯東北之命運（下）</h3>
<p>〔本報資料室稿〕數十年來，敵寇日本不僅是中國領土之侵略者，而且是世界和平的破壞者。同時，這侵略與破壞的行動，每一次都是違背國際條約與信義，出乎各國意外地突然進攻，尤其是一貫地把攻擊的責任往被攻擊者的身上推諉。</p>
<p>不宣而戰背約背信</p>
<p>遠在一八九四年七月，日本即已「發明」了「不宣而戰」的戰事，擊沉了我國載有一千兩百名士兵的運輸艦一艘，繼而又偸襲亞沙灣的我國小艦隊。那時因事倉卒，我方未及防備，故損失慘重，致遭敗北，失掉了今日始告收復之台灣及澎湖半島不算，竟還被迫承認韓國獨立，歸日本統冶，被迫賠償「損失」。時隔十年（即一九〇四年），日艦隊又突然駛進旅順港，未經宣戰，對帝俄開始了軍事行動，砲轟旅順砲台。</p>
<p>帝俄作俑强租硬借</p>
<p>這是東北受難的開始。自然，我們還得追叙到另一段受難史實。一八九八年三月二十七日，中俄兩國訂立遼東半島租借條約的時候，帝俄早已將旅順大連活生生地從我國强租硬借了去，俄皇彷彿是拍着中國人的肩膀說道：「此乃中國皇帝陛下之『明智的决定！』」同時，他又哄騙小孩似地說：「此舉並不損害中國的主權與領土完整！」我們可以說，東北人民從那時起，便已經受着苦難，加上這次日海軍的侵入，那便又多了一重苦軛了</p>
<p>一直到本年八月廿五日中蘇友好同盟條約訂立，其中訂明「大連一切行政權屬於中國」以及「旅順民政歸中國管轄」，這才使我政府與人民透出了一口鬱積已久的悶氣。</p>
<p>一九三一年之秋，日本的不宣而戰的戰事，又突然發生了，藉口「九一八事變」，蠻橫的關東軍即侵入東北中心區瀋陽，繼又侵攻東北之內部，終於把整個東北吞進了貪婪無饜的强盜的口腹。</p>
<p>美國援華仗義奮鬥</p>
<p>美國在這當兒，仗義而起，以堅决的態度保持不承認僞滿之原則，而此時美國對東北之輸出貿易，陷入了急劇降跌之地位。</p>
<p>東北在如此慘苦狀態中又過了六年，而日本乃以整吞我全國的野獸行動表現出來，這就形成了七七蘆溝橋事件以後的局勢，延長至八年之久。在這中間，美國始終聲援我國，堅主「日軍必須退出中國」，但日本猶不翻悔，却反而突行轟炸珍珠港美艦，太平洋戰爭之序幕，於此揭開，從此也就是埋下了日本屈膝的根基。</p>
<p>美對東北力主完整</p>
<p>關於東北，中美間始終並無特殊條約，就一般而言，在早期，美國就一再聲明商業機會平等，同時又聲明中國在東北之領土主權完整，此後兩國簽訂了築路借款合同，以鐵路及其收入爲借款之担保。在後期（一九〇五年以後），美國對東北僅倡導門戶開放之原則，與我國之關係，除維護其約定利益外，始終堅持着友好的態度。</p>
<p>英在東北顧全通商</p>
<p>英國在東北的政策，大體與美國並行。其間雖曾顧全其商業利益而赴僞滿作實業之考察，絲毫沒有覬覦東北的任何行動，只有野心勃勃的日本才竭力的壓制英國，使它廢然而返，以期實現其獨吞東北乃至全中國的迷夢。</p>
<p>野心家的夢終於在正義的斧鋮之下粉碎了，日本不得不帶着它那被擊碎了的夢而屈膝於我國和盟國，它把已經半吞了去的東北從無力的大口裏嘔了出來，這一來，不啻給世界任何野心未泯的國家以當頭的悶棒！</p>
<p>受了傷的東北，將無疑地受到必要的撫慰與治療，使其復歸於母親的懷抱，健全而且長成起來。</p>

<h3>肇事人員決予嚴辦　電影院昨晚復業　鐵市長發表談話表示遺憾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日各報發現本市全體電影院啓事一則，內稱因不堪不法軍人之滋擾，如本月廿三日大上海·南京·麗都·三戲院之職員遭毆受傷。本月廿八日滬光戲院除毆傷經理史延磐外，並將該院生財設備搗毀。爲對此種橫暴行動之抗議，及表示對受傷同人之深切同情，乃公決於昨日全市電影院一律停業一天，以期引起黨政軍憲各當局，及社會各界人士之注意，而加以切實有效之制止。故昨日星期日上下午，全市各電影院並無一家開映電影。惟入晚各電影院爲遵奉淞滬警備總司令部之命，已將夜塲電影一律恢復開映。聞今後對於軍人觀劇辦法，已由有關當局開始籌商，俾此種不幸事件，從此不再發生，以維正當商人之利益。</p>
<p>未經呈訴亦有未合</p>
<p>錢市長爲本市全體電影院公決停業一天事，特發表談話如次：報載全市影院不勝挨打，停業一天，表示申訴一則，本人閱後，不勝遺憾。查二十八日滬光影戲院事件，已由淞滬警備總司令部拘捕九人，余巳飭嚴厲審辦。該電影協會籌備委員會，未向本府及淞滬警備總部呈訴，遽予決議停業一天，雖非政治性的罷工，於法亦有未合。現一面再飭警備總部嚴辦肇事人員，並整肅紀律；一面令飭社會局傳詢該會負責人，予以合法之糾正。此後無論何種團體，均應依據法律程序作合理之申訴，否則應一併嚴懲，以爲妨碍社會秩序者戒。</p>
<p>勸告復業結果圓滿</p>
<p>電影同業公會於昨日假座美琪大戲院，召集各影戲院負責人開會，議决自動停演，並請求當局處置。淞滬警備總司令部爲維持治安，整飭軍紀起見，派員調查眞相，並作澈底之處理。經探悉警備總司令部於昨日上午，由稽查處程處長一鳴處理此事，程處長曾親往辣斐德路電影公會主席梁其田之寓所，在座有該會法律顧問朱啓超，同業匡寶榮。程處長表示軍政當局，爲維持市區秩序，並謀五百萬市民在休假日仍能享受娛樂，請梁主席勸告同業自動復業。至於肇事之散兵游勇，警備總司令部决予嚴懲，保障各戲院之合法利益。過去警備總司令部曾一再通令各軍事機關與部隊主管，嚴微軍人滋擾戲院，並妥擬各種有效辦法制止在案，商談結果，至爲圓滿。梁君允予轉知各同業，决盡可能照常放映，使上海市民仍能享受星期日之正當消遣。</p>
<p>滋擾事件續有發生</p>

<h3>本市電價　再度調整　增收附加每度十二元</h3>
<p>上海電力公司等以電價調整試行期滿，比因煤價高昂，不敷開支，呈請上海市公用局，准將電價再度調整。當由該局據情呈報上海市政府，並提交第一次市政諮議委員會討論。以上次調整電價，係依據煤價每噸一萬元估計，目下煤斤價格，照燃料委員會指示，有將近二萬元之趨勢，即以電力公司存煤之價值而論，每噸平均亦已達一萬六千五百元，擬在每級電價上徵收劃一之煤價費，以資貼補。其計算方法，即以每噸煤價高下一千元，各級每度電價，可隨之高下二元。今煤價旣自估計之一萬元增高至一萬六千五百元，是每噸煤價已超出陸千元，則依據上項標準，本市各級用電可一律徵收煤價附加費，每度十二元。惟嗣後煤價减低，此項附加費，即照此比例核减。再此項新辦法實行後，所有各電燈小量用戶，如因用電不够，可以申述理由，逕函各主管公司，請改爲大量用戶時，各該公司亦不得託詞拒絕，以昭公允。聞此項辦法，業經電奉經濟部核准，自三十五年一月十日起，（即三十四年十二月十日起所用之電度）施行，並由該局通知各電力公司遵辦。</p>

<h3>已達到理想程度　年終大掃除結束　南市閘北清潔程度較差</h3>
<p>市衛生局依據大掃除服務組所派五十七組工作人員之彙報，略稱：市區各街道清潔程度，經此次年終大掃除後，已達到理想之程度。惟南市及閘北二區之整潔程度，因戰前已較前租界區域相差甚遠，再經敵偽於盤踞時期，加以任意摧殘，人力物力之不足，致積存於南市邑廟等處之泥土，不易淸除。</p>
<p>市區各里弄方面，尚欠淸潔，察其原因，計有數端：（一）大都里弄中除缺乏垃圾箱外，所存者亦已損壞，不堪應用。（二）里弄中雖有垃圾箱。而居民不守規則，隨意傾倒垃圾，任其遺漏箱外。（三）里弄中往往無人負責行掃。（四）弄口設置攤位，阻得交通，致垃圾手推車等，不能入內工作。</p>
<p>對於以上各點，觀察團表示亦然。此次大掃除宣傳方面，尚稱滿意，除事前由衛生局印製大掃除告市民書，市民須知，及淸潔標語五萬張，送往警察局轉各分局，分發全市民衆外，報紙及廣播電台上，亦從事宣傳。又全市各電影院迄今，尚在放映淸潔標語，促進市民注意有關事項。</p>

<h3>精神建設與藝術運動</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>〔本文係本月二十八日中央廣播事業管理處上海廣播電台講稿）</p>
<p>現在世界的暴力已經消除，今後的努力，一方面是要防止暴力的死灰復燃，以維持人類的永久安寧，另一方面這高度物質文明的二十世紀必須兼及於精神文明的建設，尤其是吾國精神建設的重要更超過物質的建設，使得一切自私猜疑嫉妒卑怯……許多劣性完全消滅，要達到這個目的，惟有提高人類最高精神活動的藝術，以陶養眞善美的生活，因爲人類，一切有形的行爲與無形的意識，出於眞就是善，也就是美；反轉來說，由美的刺激可以造成善的反應，進而爲眞的表現。這樣全人類只有眞，沒有僞，只有善，沒有惡，只有美，沒有醜，只有愛沒有恨，大家不但共享物質的充實，且可共享精神的愉快，携手進入世界大同的領域。所以闡揚眞善美的人生的崇高理想，培養相親相愛的愉快光明的精神，建樹人類永久和平，這是精神建設必要的基礎。</p>
<p>抗戰以後，國人爲現實所束縛，爲物質所壓迫，因之失去人性本有的自由精神的衰頽社會的混亂，處處表現出落後與病態，我們在這個大時代裏，我們當然要切實努力於經濟，軍事，科學，政治，敎育的建設；可是更不能忽略的是藝術，文化，因爲它是精神建設的第一步。</p>
<p>人類本來天賦了審美的能力與創造的能力，因爲美的形式企求心靈的慰藉，並且達到改變人格增進社會幸福的許多理想，所以在此建國過程中，與其說精神建設的重要超過物質的建設，還不如說社會藝術文化建設是刻不容緩的事。</p>
<p>幾千年來，吾國對於精神文化實有不朽的成就與供獻，即藝術的業蹟眞是遠駕歐美，終因保存發揮的無方，幾將湮滅，使研究的人不能在前代遺品之前摩挲想像追踪深造，民衆更無接觸機緣，生活枯窒，徬徨無措，反讓他人越俎代庖，言之眞是痛心！</p>
<p>現在抗戰勝利，吾國已是世界四大强國之一，國際間的合作又獲得非常密切，當此建國時代，對於藝術的設施當然非常急需，在此特貢芻獻以備採擇。所謂藝術的設施，就是藝術運動的展開，這裏提出四個具體意見，假使能够切實做去，不但中國藝術文化可以復興，精神建設也可以從此確立了。</p>
<p>一　博物館的整理與建立</p>
<p>歐美各國通都大邑鄉村城市，皆設有博物館，羅列古代藝術名蹟以及現代傑作，這種設施不特可以提高民衆審美興味，且可給學者及嗜古者硏究的便利，博物館的經營，像徵集、管理、陳列、編目，綴補、保存，已成一種專門科學，運用精確的方法來從事，著名的如法國的羅偉爾，英國的大不列顚博物館等，眞是井然有序，蔚成壯觀。</p>
<p>在吾國各地本有少數簡陋的博物館，或古物保存所的設立，可是都是因循茍且，陳列雜亂，旣無報告，又無統計，且時有古物被竊的傳聞，實是中外騰笑的事實，所以對於現有的博物館與古物保存所，不但要設法恢復充實，確應該要完全運用科學方法來經營，是今後千萬不可忽視的。其次關於博物館或古物保存所的建立，應該按照交通和人口的標準來決定，所以我認爲像南京上海北平靑島漢口天津廣州重慶西安等地，宜儘先建築大規模的現代化博物館，至少也須將原有的古物保存所，加以擴充和改良，儲藏藝術珍品，並可將從日本收回的藝術古物分別陳列，如有不能移動的像歷朝造像，墓闕，浮彫等，應請專家摹作復製品，分發各地博物館陳列，這樣可以有普遍觀賞硏究的機會了。</p>
<p>二　畫廊與音樂演奏會</p>
<p>博物館爲藝術品固定的永久的陳列處，而「畫廊」便是經常更換介紹展覽藝術品的地方，吾國自十八年舉行了第一次全國美展，到二十六年又舉行第二次全國美展，抗戰軍興全國美展即告中輟，這中的原因，雖然很多，其中沒有畫廊可以使用，也許是最主要的一個。當第一次全國美展時籌備到半途，我適首次奉命赴歐考察，那時的會塲是上海國貨路的中華國貨會，牠的不合理想當是意中事，在南京國立美術陳列館舉行的二全美展，會塲問題雖較合理，可是還感到許多缺點，所以各大都市應該從速建立合理的「畫廊」，經常作古今中外一家一派藝術作品的展覽，使民衆有適當的塲所觀賞藝術，使現代作家有適當的地方展覽作品，對於藝術演進前途是有很多帮助的。</p>
<p>空間藝術的繪畫彫刻等的傳佈是要靠「畫廊」，而時間藝術的音樂的傳播是需要演奏會了，演奏會是應該經常舉行，介紹世界名曲，對於售價應立使减低，以普及民衆欣賞音樂的機會，又宜在政府領導之下，各地都有像上海的大規模的交響樂團的組織與活動。</p>
<p>三　國立美術院的設立</p>
<p>考歐美各國藝術的設施，規模宏大，意義深長，實由國立美術院主其事，這裏頭由政府選聘著名藝術家及學者爲委員，專事策劃全國藝術敎育及社會藝術設施方針和辦法，以及藝術事業的咨詢與研究，主要的事業有博物館，美術學校，音樂學校，全國定期展覽會，藝術獎金等等，各國間雖制度不同，其用意則一，吾國當此復興時期，國立美術院實有仿照設立的必要，有了這個機關，可以把全國藝術設施統一籌辦，不會隨一人一家的興趣而轉移，且可收事半功倍的效率。</p>
<p>四　都市建設的藝術化</p>
<p>吾國經此八年抗戰，把暴日打倒，由於國際的合作，盟友的贊助，各地的建設事業，勢必日新月異，而都市的現代化，實爲必然的趨勢，我兩度歐遊，經歷各國大小城市，徘徊觀覽之下，都感到一地有一地的特長，這種特長的顯示，皆繫於建設上的藝術化，建設上的藝術化，並不困難，只要在設計者能够留心時代的興趣，地域的形勢，布置公私建築物作有機的構成，避免一切不合理的與散漫的形式，處處以可人悅目爲標準，則不求美而自美，吾國歷來都市建設不事抄襲舊章，使是外人主持，弄得不中不西，非騾非馬，當今從事建設的時候，應該予以注意都市的藝術化，使民衆感覺生活上的愉快，且觀瞻上也覺適宜，從事建設的當局諸君，對這點意見，想來必定贊成的。</p>
<h3>迷霧</h3>
<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>給一個朋友的信裏，我這樣的寫着：</p>
<p>「是誰引領着我走上這條多刺的玫瑰之路，連珍惜靑春的血液都不可能了，寧願以生命換取一滴淸澈的淚，不要在這迷霧的路上走，然而又有什麼用呢？我肩負着感情的重荷。」</p>
<p>是的，我肩負着感情的重荷，在荆棘的路上走，我要尋找，然而是要尋找一點什麼呢？是一次冰冷的親吻，还是一回淡漢的微笑呢？我需要這些嗎？</p>
<p>我不懂這些是否能溫暖我？</p>
<p>一個人不应该受情感的愚弄，要尅制自己，要珍惜灼爍的熱情，可是誰又能逃得過說謊的嘴和騙人的眼睛，明知向你炫惑的是美麗的謊，却又將熱情浪費在這裏，是爲什麼呢？是人生的矛盾抑是自己的拙笨？</p>
<p>我不懂，我沒有方法解釋，沒有方法撥開這迷霧，這是一個不可思議的謎。</p>
<p>可是我知道，生命的精力不應該耗費在一些細小的地方，尤其是年輕的時候，靑春的血液該像朝露一樣的可貴。</p>
<p>但，什麽可以使我堅定呢？</p>
<p>生活和思想是在矛盾的追逐。讀過許多傳記，許多成功的偉人和失敗者的生活和思想，我都知道了，他們是怎樣的在迷霧裏旋轉，他們是怎樣的走過迷雾的路，得着了光明與生命，然而我得到的是什麼呢？那末空虛的，是自己的渺小嗎？寂寞像是一片無垠的沙漠圍繞着我，也許是因爲有着過多的希望和過多綠色的憧憬的緣故？</p>
<p>雖然，我是在迷霧里旋轉，忍受一些訕笑，我信任自己是不會在迷霧里倒下去的，因爲懂得自己失敗的人，距離着成功是不會遠的。</p>
<p>我信任着自己，我有這樣的信心：雖然肩負着感情的重荷，總有一天我會穿過這重迷霧的路。</p>

<h3>談「圈」</h3>
<p>— 謝東平</p>
<p>假如我是一頭羊，我願意作一頭塞外的羊，因爲塞外的羊，牠可以自由自在的在塞北的原野上，吃牠喜歡吃的草，假如我是一隻鳥，我願意作一隻終日爲了自已的食，而飛逐寰宇的空中之鳥。</p>
<p>我厭棄那被人關在柵欄裏的羊，牠十分馴服，毫不提出反抗，只是向牠的主人哶哶的哀呌，企圖得到草的食料，來維持牠不自由的生命。我尤其厭棄那爲主子所豢養的「八哥」，「鸚鵡」之類，牠只是呌出牠主人喜歡的聲音，只是唱着牠主人要牠唱的歌曲，而牠却自以爲是飛鳥中絕頂的聰明者。</p>
<p>世上的凡事，凡物，往往利害參半，善惡參半，譬如一種範團，它可以使你得到安全的保障，它也可以使你失去行動的自由。在柵欄裏的羊，在籠中的鳥，自然不必顧慮兇禽猛獸，如虎啊，獅啊，梟啊，鷙啊來傷害牠們，但是牠們也不可能越出柵欄與籠兒一步。</p>
<p>羊的柵欄，鳥的籠兒，是牠們生活上不可超越的「圈」。天下假如沒有柵欄，羊這種動物，一定是一種很有出息的動物，沒有籠，鳥這種動物，一定是最自由的動物。</p>
<p>在人類社會裏，假如沒有或古或今或大或小的「圈」，那末人一定人人都有出息，人人都能發揮他創造的才能，人人都能過一種獨立而自由的生活。人都想作帝王，這作帝王的慾望，就是人類在封建時代思想上的「圈」。可是人究竟不同於禽獸，所以作了帝王的人，就想作神仙了。作帝王的人，在那個皇城的圈兒裏，實在極不自由，而神仙，他可以在天上，也可以在地上，是非常自由的。</p>
<p>一個人凡是他的生活，還沒有形成「圈」，那末，他的前途是未可限量的，凡已形成「圈」那未，他的命運也就確定了，在圈兒裏面，絕看不到圈的外面，好像帝王在皇城裏的奢糜，他絕看不到民間的疾苦，一個生有癩痢頭兒子的父母，他（她）絕看不到頭皮不癩的孩子們的好處。</p>
<p>一隻被人關在柵欄裏的羊，和爲主人豢義在籠裏的「八哥」，牠一定會笑那在地上在空中到處尋找食物的塞外之羊與空中之鳥，爲愚蠢。</p>
<p>人的惡作劇是造「圈」，爲羊兒造「圈」，爲鳥兒造「圈」，爲自己造「圈」，這一「圈」，世上就有羊，鳥，人，人上之人與人下之人了。</p>
<p>凡要看眞事物，凡要辨眞非是，一定要跳在圈兒外邊，天下如果眞有愚蠢的話，那末，這愚蠢就屬於在圈兒裏而不知道自己在圈兒裏的動物。</p>

<h3>Small Shadows Looming Between China and the Soviet Union; Northeast Situation Remains Gloomily Stagnant; Discussions Pending on Industrial and Mining Interests and Landing</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Beiping, 29th] It is said that Chiang Ching-kuo did not even have a peaceful Christmas, busily braving wind and snow to fly to Moscow. If this news is true, then his great task should be to remove some grains of sand from the eyes of Sino-Soviet friendship. The first grain of sand is probably the industrial and mining interests. Although the Soviet government has never formally raised it, the problem does exist. According to the viewpoint of Soviet Far East Marshal Malinovsky, the heavy industry in the Northeast is all Japanese military industry and contains a significant implication of anti-Soviet warfare. Therefore, it should be a fruit of the Red Army's victory. However, Chinese officials in charge of Northeast economics believe that war spoils should be things that can be moved away, and the Soviet army can take what it considers war spoils back to their own country. The negotiation of this matter stopped here and was not resolved. In the past two months, this problem has cast a shadow over the Northeast like a ghost. The second grain of sand should be the failure of the majority of the National Army to land in Dalian at the end of October, which even senior officials who signed treaties in Moscow felt was very sudden and unexpected. Recently, Malinovsky stated that Dalian is not under his jurisdiction and he cannot send liaison officers to assist in the takeover, which has put Chinese officials in extreme bewilderment. In addition, the Andong issue is also a small grain of sand. The Soviet side has stated that it cannot assist in the takeover of that area because there are no Soviet troops stationed there. Andong Province is a war zone rich in mountains and people of different nationalities. Japan never truly ruled this area during the fourteen years of the Northeast's occupation. A person of considerable standing told me that if Andong cannot be smoothly taken over, the Northeast cannot be at peace. The so-called grains of sand may not only be these, but these alone have already pricked the eyes of Sino-Soviet friendship. Shouldn't everyone remove them from each other's eyes?</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Beiping, 28th] The situation in the Northeast is like malaria, with alternating chills and fever. In the past half-week, news from the Northeast has become stagnant again. Some unresolved issues may have been discussed in countries extremely far away. Chiang Ching-kuo's whereabouts have become a mystery here. Currently, the takeover work in the Northeast seems to be a matter of formality and has not yet been agreed upon. Xiong Shihui is in Beiping and seems quite leisurely. For the past three days, he has gathered personnel from the three provincial governments every day to discuss the principles of conduct and work, giving speeches lasting over two hours each time. Although Chairman Chiang has ordered the chairmen of each province to arrive in the Northeast before New Year's Day, it seems that it will have to be slightly delayed. Most of them will likely greet the new year in Beiping. If everything goes smoothly, they are expected to return to the Northeast in nine batches before the 4th or 5th of next month. The National Army preparing for airlift to Changchun is still awaiting orders here. Li Zefen, commander of the Fifth Division, flew to Jinzhou a few days ago to meet Du Yuming and seek instructions. The start of the airlift should not be far off. Shu Shicun, deputy commander of the New Sixth Army, arrived in Beiping the day before yesterday. Soldiers of the New Sixth Army, fully equipped with American gear, appeared on the streets of Beiping for the first time.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Beiping, 29th] Chairman of Rehe Province, Liu Duoquan, flew to Jinzhou a few days ago to discuss the takeover of Rehe with General Du Yuming. After finishing the discussions, he flew to Tianjin yesterday and returned to Beiping this afternoon to prepare everything. Over forty members of the Rehe Provincial Government who came to Beiping from Chongqing have arrived. Among the department heads, only Liu Lianke, head of the Education Department, has not arrived in Suiyuan. The remaining twenty or so will go to Shanghai from Chongqing and then head north by sea. The Beiping-Rehe Railway is currently only open to Shixia. General judgement says that the personnel of the Rehe Provincial Government will detour through Jinzhou and advance into Rehe with the army.</p>
<h3>Although Our Mayor Has Assumed Office; Soviet Side Still Controls Changchun and Shenyang; National Army Moves Westward to Rehe and Recaptures Yixian</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Beiping, 30th] The current situation of the National Government taking over Changchun and Shenyang seems to be more nominal than real. According to sources close to the Northeast Headquarters: Although the mayor appointed by the National Government has taken office, the cities of Changchun and Shenyang are still effectively controlled by the Soviet army. Aside from the Chinese mayor and his small number of staff, and personnel from the Bank of China, Soviet officials continue to operate as they see fit. General Du Yuming's troops moving north to Shenyang are awaiting the results of the Sino-Soviet negotiations in Xinmin. At the same time, General Du's troops are also extending westward into the Rehe area, continuing to exert pressure on the port of Yingkou to the east. According to the latest military news: General Du Yuming's troops, extending westward into Rehe, have already recaptured Yixian. Yixian is the railway transportation hub connecting Jinzhou to Rehe. After the National Army recovered Jingumen (transliteration), which is on the border of Rehe and the Northeast, it continued to extend into Rehe Province. Soviet officials have announced that they have withdrawn from the area. The city governments of Changchun, Shenyang, and other cities are like "one-man bands." All important affairs, such as police affairs, transportation, and transport issues, must rely on the Soviet side. Although the Bank of China in these two places has resumed operations, Soviet military currency continues to circulate in the market. Yang Chuoan, the mayor of Harbin, arrived at his post yesterday. The mayor of Dalian will also fly from Changchun to Harbin in the short term and is currently in Changchun awaiting permission from the Soviet side before assuming office. After the mayors appointed by the central government arrive, the Soviet authorities in Dalian and Harbin will continue to exercise their powers, because before the National Army arrives by airlift, a small number of officials are really insufficient to take over and manage the cities.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Tianjin, 30th] In the week of Christmas, the American troops in North China, in addition to guarding the railway lines in the cold wind and protecting the coal trains coming from the Northeast, did not encounter other sniper incidents. Du Yuming's troops have not yet moved into Shenyang, but another 5,000 central government troops have newly arrived at Huludao from South China on Liberty-class transport ships. According to reliable sources, Du Yuming's troops may not be able to enter Shenyang in two weeks. The delay of the National Army's entry into Jiyang is said to be because the crux of the matter is still with the Soviet Union. All parties seem to be awaiting a certain decision to determine future actions. In addition, there will be more central government troops sent from South China to land at Huludao. In the future, there will be nine or ten armies in the Northeast under the command of Du Yuming. It is expected that the National Army will not encounter resistance when entering Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin in the future.</p>
<h3>American Railway Equipment Shipped from Iran to China to Assist in Our Country's Post-War Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Washington, 29th] The Secretary of State announced today that the remaining railway equipment in Iran, worth approximately six million U.S. dollars, has been sold to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for use in China. At the same time, the White House revealed that American civil aviation aircraft engines and equipment in Iran have been ordered to be transferred from the Department of the Army to the Civil Aeronautics Administration of the Department of Commerce on New Year's Day next year, which may be related to the withdrawal of American troops from Iran in early next year. Overseas Liquidation Commissioner MacPugh announced that railway equipment originally worth over eight million U.S. dollars, now in Khorramshahr, Iran, is being transported to China by ten cargo ships and one locomotive transport ship to aid post-war economic reconstruction, while also serving as the main means of transport for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Fifty percent of all locomotives and other railway equipment will be shipped to Shanghai, and the remainder will be shipped to Hong Kong and Kowloon. The resold items include twenty diesel locomotives, one thousand five hundred and forty-eight gondola cars, one thousand three hundred and seventy boxcars, four hundred and ninety-nine flatcars, twenty-four twenty-ton cabooses, eight paving cars, and forty-two thousand eight hundred feet of seventy-five-pound railroad tracks.</p>
<h3>General Song Xilian Awarded the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Dihua, 30th] General Song Xilian, former commander-in-chief of the Eleventh Army Group of the Expeditionary Force and current director of the Ninth Branch School of the Central Military Academy, established special achievements in the counterattack against western Yunnan in May of last year. The National Government has specially awarded him the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun to recognize his merits. It is recently reported that Chairman Chiang of the National Government has telegraphed Minister Zhang Zhizhong to present the award in Dihua on his behalf. The ceremony is scheduled to be held on New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao's Party Departs for Harbin; Soviet Union Notifies Temporary Municipal Government to Prepare for Handover</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Harbin, 29th] The Soviet military authorities here have notified the temporary municipal government of Harbin to prepare for the handover. Zhang Jia'ao, Dong Chanping, Wang Zhong, and Zhu Xinmin arrived here by special train at 4:45 PM today amidst light snow after a long period of snowfall. Yang Chuoan and representatives from all sectors welcomed them at the station.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] Zhang Jia'ao departed from Shenyang by special train at 6:10 AM this morning and passed through Changchun on his way to Harbin. After a three-hour stop here, he reboarded the train and continued onward. Wang Zhong, special commissioner of the Central Bank, also accompanied him to Harbin to establish a branch.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] The newly appointed police chief, Zhang Jiong, assumed office today. Former police chief Liu Zhige has been reassigned as deputy police chief. In addition, Chen Gongliang, special commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, and Yao Gemin, chief of staff of the Division, arrived here from Beiping yesterday.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] After the snowfall, the outdoor temperature in Shenyang today was five degrees Celsius below zero, which is seventeen degrees different from Changchun's twenty-two degrees. Zhang Jia'ao was originally scheduled to fly to Harbin at 1:00 PM today, but due to heavy fog with visibility only reaching 200 meters, which made flying unfavorable, it was temporarily changed to traveling by special military train on the Changchun Railway at 7:20 PM tonight.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Liu Zhuzhou, Shenyang, 28th] When Mayor Dong Wenqi received the municipal administration at 10:00 AM on the 27th, Soviet Deputy Commander Hu Cheng and a liaison officer dispatched from the Soviet Army Headquarters in Changchun were present at the ceremony. The mayor first addressed all city government staff, district chiefs, and school principals, encouraging them to be self-aware, disciplined, orderly, and cherish the reputation of the nation, preserve local vitality. He also listed abolishing harsh policies, relieving the poor, revitalizing industry, and stabilizing people's livelihoods as the guiding principles for future administration. Subsequently, Soviet Army Commander Govodov delivered a speech, saying: Today is the day when Shenyang City, which has been occupied for fourteen years, formally returns to the rule of the Chinese Central Government, and he is very honored to be able to participate in this grand ceremony. He also solemnly stated that before his withdrawal, he will do his utmost to assist Mayor Dong in removing all obstacles that may hinder the development of the municipal administration. After the meeting, the guests and hosts raised their glasses to wish the leaders of China and the Soviet Union good health. Furthermore, when the Bank of China opened, the Soviet commander and deputy commander also attended. Banks that started operations here today also include the Bank of China.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 29th] After the National Army moved into Yixian and Qingshuihe, General Du Yuming went to inspect them on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 30th] The people of the Northeast after liberation are celebrating the first happy New Year after victory with the most excited emotions. The weather in the Northeast has been sunny recently, and the people of Jinzhou City and various counties are actively preparing funds and materials, buying wine and slaughtering pigs to comfort the National Army and celebrate New Year's Day.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang to Broadcast Tonight</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to broadcast to the nation at 7:00 PM on the 31st, using the "1200," "5918," "6118," and "7153" four kilocycle waves by the Central and International radio stations for joint broadcast, which will be rebroadcast by national radio stations.</p>
<h3>Northeast and North China Desperately Need Personnel; Various Industries Await Experts to Take Over</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Jinzhou, 29th] The victory of war does not necessarily mean the achievement of peace. This can be powerfully proved by the affairs in the Northeast. The land of the Nine Eastern Provinces is fertile and rich in treasures. For fourteen years, it has been ruled by Japan under a puppet government. Now it is gradually being recovered by the central government. However, Japan's economic power there has not yet been broken. When Japan controlled the Northeast, it anticipated the day when it would launch a large-scale military attack on Siberia. Therefore, it rapidly carried out an industrialization plan and built railways extensively. As a result, the total mileage of the railways is more than the sum of all other parts of China. There are also many textile factories. The production of coal and iron is abundant, and there are also some oil reserves. On fertile land cultivated for hundreds of years, industrial cities have sprung up suddenly. This economic development is mostly maintained by highly trained Japanese technicians. They are still staying here. Because China does not have enough talents to replace them, it has no choice but to continue employing them. Otherwise, all kinds of factories will be closed down. Many foreign observers and knowledgeable Chinese people believe that this kind of reliance on the Japanese will inevitably allow the Japanese to maintain their dominant control in the Northeast's industrial circle. A certain important person even said: "If we let the Japanese continue to take root, I am afraid that we will no longer be able to eradicate them. Their creativity is endless. They will inevitably take advantage of every opportunity when China is divided to consolidate their position." Japan's diplomatic policy has always been based on the division of China. Tens of thousands of Japanese technicians, relying on their talents, have such dreams to profit from it. The situation in North China is similar. Industrial technicians and Japanese soldiers continue to be employed. There are 50,000 American troops and tens of thousands of puppet troops guarding the railways around Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping to prevent the communist army from sabotage. On a certain railway line from Qinhuangdao to the inland, there are four types of guards: Central Army, American Army, Japanese Army, and Puppet Army. This railway connects to the Kailuan Coal Mine, which is jointly operated by China and Britain. Coal for Shanghai, Beiping, and Hong Kong is all supplied from here. The American army is very puzzled by this situation, because when they came here, they were told that their mission was to disarm the Japanese army. Six months ago, they were still fighting bloody battles with the Japanese army on the Ryukyu Islands, but now they are in China and are guarding together with the Japanese army. Isn't this strange? The Japanese army is located between the Central Army and the Communist Army and can be used as a buffer. Japanese people with industrial technology can be used to operate factories in North China. In short, the brainpower and physical strength of the defeated army have all been utilized. However, the question is whether the defeated Japanese can still maintain their dominant position in the Nine Eastern Provinces and North China. If so, then the employed Japanese will still have the opportunity to be the masters.</p>
<h3>Chairman Gan Gu Zhenglun Departs Lanzhou for Tianshui to Attend Baotian Railway Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 30th] The Baotian Railway is scheduled to officially open on New Year's Day. Gu Zhenglun believes that this is an unprecedented grand event in Gansu Province, so he will take a car from Lanzhou to Tianshui on the 30th to attend the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 30th] Telephone from Dingxi: Chairman Gu arrived in Dingxi from Lanzhou at around 5:00 PM on the 30th and will go to Tianshui on the morning of the 31st. In addition to attending the Baotian Railway opening ceremony, Gu will also convene the county magistrates of southern Gansu in Tianshui to give instructions on the key tasks for the coming year.</p>
<h3>Marshall to Go to North China</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Today is the second Sunday that Special Envoy Marshall has spent in the foggy mountain city. At 11:00 AM, Marshall went to the Qiujing Middle School Church to attend the service.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Chongqing, 30th] American Special Envoy Marshall is expected to go to Shanghai within the next few days and may also go to North China. Although the final plan has not been decided, Marshall will leave Chongqing for about a week.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Chongqing, 30th] As the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers and General Marshall's shuttle diplomacy in Chongqing come to a close, the Communist Party is advancing its political offensive while taking a wait-and-see attitude on the military front. The Kuomintang, on the other hand, is maintaining its firm political defensive posture while expanding its military strength. Both sides have high expectations for the Political Consultative Conference and General Marshall's efforts.</p>
<h3>Contents of Petitions from Beiping Citizens Released; Mostly Requests for Pensions and Relief; Chairman Chiang Orders Swift and Careful Handling Based on Established Principles</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Chairman Chiang's recent inspection tours of Beiping and Nanjing, where he announced the acceptance of petitions from the people, have greatly inspired the people of various places. It is reported that Beiping received a total of 2,124 petitions, the content of which mainly consisted of requests for pensions, relief, and job assignments, totaling 651 cases. Among them, requests for pensions were from soldiers who were wounded or killed in action during the war of resistance, or from public educators and civilians who were wounded or killed as a result of the war of resistance. Requests for relief were from families of soldiers who were wounded or killed in action during the war of resistance, or from families of public servants and civilians who were injured or killed on duty, as well as from civilians and students who were impoverished and unable to make a living or unable to attend school. Requests for work were mostly from soldiers, public educators, and unemployed workers who had participated in the war of resistance. In addition, there were also requests to investigate and locate relatives and friends who were missing or conscripted by the enemy during the war of resistance, to investigate and return occupied property and real estate, and to release those who were detained in cases. The next largest category was letters reporting the atrocities of the enemy and puppets, totaling 737 cases. Enemy officers and soldiers, enemy expatriates, and puppet officials, puppet soldiers, puppet secret agents, and traitors in various cultural and economic sectors were reported, and many concrete facts were listed or considerable evidence was provided. Next, there were 353 suggestions for national construction, providing opinions on various military, political, economic, and social constructions, many of which were worthy of reference, showing the people's eagerness for national construction. There were also 153 complaints against public officials, military police, and takeover personnel for illegal acts and dereliction of duty. Some were seeking redress for their own suffering, while others were reporting facts witnessed or heard out of a sense of justice.

At today's meeting, Chairman Jiang Yong summarized the key points of the approved proposals as follows: (1) The national budget should be coordinated with national policy. There are still many incomplete aspects in the draft general budget for the coming year, making the review work difficult. (2) Regarding the revenue sector, progressive donation of assets should be increased, foreign exchange deposits frozen in the United States and the United Kingdom should be used, and income from customs duties and national taxes on tobacco and sugar should be increased to make up for deficit debts. In addition, salt taxes should be reduced to ease the burden on the people. (3) Regarding the expenditure sector, education funding should be increased to 5% of the total budget, funding for the construction of the Northwest and the improvement of equipment in courts and prisons in various provinces, funding for the development of coastal fisheries, and expenditures of provinces and cities should all be increased. The financial revenue and expenditure system should be revised, and land taxes should still be uniformly allocated to local governments. Military expenditures should be reduced, and military personnel's salaries should be increased. (4) The budgets of various institutions should be revised. The proposed budgets of specialized committees under the Supreme National Defense Council, the Central Design Bureau, the Party and Government Work Assessment Committee, and the National People's Political Council should be doubled. (5) Redundant institutions should be merged, and a portion of the funds saved should be used to increase the salaries of public educators so that they reach twice the standard of the original draft proposal. Finally, the proposal submitted by Councilors Chu Fucheng and four others, that the government should separately reward laid-off civil servants and give priority to their repatriation, and that governments at all levels should employ them, was passed and sent to the government for implementation.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Grading System and Quota System for Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange issues are of utmost concern to current observers. With rumors of a new exchange rate to be announced on New Year's Day, the market is even more concerned. In the past, only the financial and import/export industries paid attention to the upward movements of the previous exchange rate. Now, general industry and commerce, and even the general public, are all watching with anticipation. The reason for this is not an increased interest in economics among the general population, but rather the increased relationship between exchange rates and people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>In the past, our country was a silver standard nation, and all prices fluctuated with the gold-silver ratio. When the gold-silver ratio was relatively stable, all prices, whether for imports or exports, were also relatively stable. When there were drastic changes, it was only when the balance of international payments was disrupted. After a period of remedy, all prices would often adjust accordingly and return to a stable state. The reason for this was that domestic prices and foreign prices had a common standard. What was this common standard? It was hard currency, that is, the gold-silver ratio.</p>
<p>Since the circulation of silver coins ceased and all banknotes effectively became inconvertible paper money, prices and currency values began to diverge. However, at that time, banknotes still had a fixed exchange rate with the British pound and the US dollar, i.e., the exchange rate with the British pound was set at one shilling and two and a half pence, and application was relatively convenient. Therefore, although the banknotes themselves had no direct value, they still had indirect value, and they still had a certain value. Therefore, prices were still in a relatively stable state at that time. In other words, prices had a close connection with banknotes, and domestic prices still had a close connection with foreign prices. The reason why domestic prices did not fluctuate drastically in the era of inconvertible paper money lies in this.</p>
<p>Since the coastal ports were completely blockaded by the enemy, and goods could not circulate, the central bank's foreign exchange quotation became a nominal exchange rate with only a name but no market. All the few export bills of exchange and remittances from overseas Chinese were also controlled by the central government. Therefore, domestic prices began to be completely controlled by banknotes, completely divorced from the gold-silver ratio, and even more completely divorced from foreign prices. Moreover, as a result of the long-term war of resistance, banknotes increased and inflation occurred due to financial reasons, and the occupied areas were also flooded with countless counterfeit currencies. Therefore, prices continued to skyrocket, the foundation of industry and commerce was shaken, and the suffering of the people increased day by day. Today, the general public, unanimously paying attention to exchange rates and unanimously hoping for the early regulation of exchange rates, focuses on this, not solely for the sake of restoring import and export trade. To put it plainly, they hope that prices and currency will regain contact, and even regain contact with foreign prices, thereby stabilizing prices, stabilizing industry and commerce, and stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>The aforementioned sentiment can be said to be very common. Not only do the people hope so, but the government also hopes so. The problem is: how should this exchange rate be regulated? Because if it is set too high, it means that the currency value is low. Then, on the good side, it can (1) stimulate enterprises, (2) promote export trade, (3) protect domestic industry, (4) encourage all production, and (5) reduce the deficit of imports over exports, so that the balance of international payments is not too far apart. However, with benefits come drawbacks. At the same time, it will also cause or exacerbate various adverse consequences. In short: (1) prices will still rise, (2) life will still be difficult, (3) labor unrest will not be quelled, (4) it will be difficult to obtain replenishment in this time of depleted resources, (5) especially the import of machinery, raw materials, and all necessities will increase difficulties, and (6) it may provoke resentment and retaliation from importing countries. If it is set too low, that is, the currency value is increased, then the advantages and disadvantages are exactly the opposite. It is very difficult to find a method that comprehensively considers both.</p>
<p>Some people advocate that it should not be raised or lowered, but stabilized at the current black market exchange rate limit. On the surface, it seems that it can reduce fluctuations and gradually stabilize prices and life, but in reality, it is not entirely true.</p>
<p>Because domestic and foreign prices are still disconnected and have not reached the point of adjustment. According to pre-war market prices, domestic prices have risen at least a thousand times, while the decline in currency value is only three or four hundred times. If the foreign exchange rate is stabilized according to the current black market, then ordering foreign goods with foreign exchange will cost less than one-third or even one-tenth or two-tenths of domestic prices. Everyone will scramble to order foreign goods, which will inevitably flow in continuously. As a result, prices will have to fall sharply, national industries will be in danger, and various agricultural products and raw materials will also be forced into a situation where they cannot compete. This phenomenon is already very prominently displayed before our eyes!</p>
<p>In order to reconcile the above-mentioned conflicts of interest, there is also a rumor of graded regulations, roughly divided into four levels, namely: (1) the import of machinery and other items needed for national defense industrial construction; (2) the expenses of embassies and consulates stationed abroad; (3) major commodities; and (4) luxury goods. This is certainly a painstaking approach, very reasonable, and very practical. The most noteworthy of these is the level of major commodities, i.e., necessities. Why should necessities be set lower? This is naturally because they are needed domestically and are welcomed for import. However, it is still necessary to pay attention to: (1) whether they are truly necessary; (2) whether there are substitutes domestically; and (3) whether there are similar products and industries in this country. Because the intention of grading clearly contains some protective meaning, if the import is over-encouraged due to the reason of necessity, the effectiveness of grading will be lost.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the level of luxury goods. Setting the exchange rate higher, that is, increasing its cost, is a common aspiration, without a doubt. However, to what extent should it be raised in order to achieve our expected goals? This is worth studying. Usually, this kind of means is adopted for no more than two reasons: one is due to protective policies, and the other is due to financial considerations. Now, the domestic luxury goods industry has not yet developed to the point where it needs protection, so the reason for raising the currency value is undoubtedly due to financial considerations, that is, to reduce the waste of foreign exchange funds. However, the people of our country have a fashion of worshiping foreign goods. The more expensive the goods are, the more they are valued. Therefore, in order to achieve the goal of saving foreign exchange, it is also necessary to carefully consider the degree of the increase in the implementation.</p>
<p>We believe that in addition to the grading system, we may as well go further and adopt a quota system to complement the grading system. That is, unnecessary imports can be classified and numerically limited. When this quota is exceeded, the supply of its bills of exchange will be stopped. The higher the unnecessary nature, the stricter the quota will be. If this is done, the above-mentioned expected goals can be achieved.</p>
<p>Our country is a country with a trade deficit. In the past, foreign trade was completely liberal, so that the increase in the trade deficit was endless. Based on the current differences between domestic and foreign prices, the eagerness of the import industry to try, and the stagnant state of export trade, if only the exchange rate is regulated and no quota is set, I am afraid that this trend of trade deficit will still be unstoppable, and the reverse trend of international borrowing will also be impossible to improve.</p>
<p>We know that a trade deficit is not absolutely worrying. The trade deficit of raw materials, machinery, transportation equipment, cultural equipment, etc., which can directly or indirectly improve domestic production and culture, is more beneficial than not. Therefore, we advocate quotas and grading at the same time. Grading should complement the quota system so as not to hinder the import of the above-mentioned goods, and at the same time, it can still achieve the effect of saving foreign exchange.</p>
<p>There are many types of so-called quota methods: (1) it is based on the country, that is, the import quota is differentiated according to the commercial treaty or trade relationship between each other; (2) it is based on the amount, that is, the import quota is raised or lowered according to the type of goods; (3) it is to apply the two methods of (1) and (2) in a mixed manner, and then distinguish by category in addition to the country. We advocate that the second method should be adopted purely, only restricting the total annual import volume by category, regardless of which country it comes from. Because this issue, although it also has its research value, is not within the scope of exchange rates, and it is easy to cause various adverse consequences, so it will not be discussed in detail.</p>

<h3>Korean People's Fury Opposes the Trusteeship System, Strikes and Market Closures Occur, the Situation is Extremely Dangerous</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 30th] After the news of the Moscow Conference's decision to supervise Korea for five years reached here, Koreans seeking independence all cried out in protest yesterday. Strikes and market closures are now occurring, and brawls occur from time to time in the streets. Some people are throwing stones at US soldiers. The resentment of the trusteeship is one reason for this riot. However, it is also largely related to the left and right factions taking the opportunity to cause trouble and restart internal conflicts. The US military authorities announced martial law last night, prohibiting passage after 8 pm every night to prevent further accidents. However, the situation is dangerous, and more serious disturbances are feared to be unavoidable. Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in southern Korea, told local reporters that the supervisory system decided by the Moscow Conference for Korea will not be implemented immediately. The word "supervision" is extremely unwelcome here, and Hodge's statement was unfortunately issued too late, as the news of five years of supervision had already spread far and wide. The strike and market closure began at noon yesterday, with hundreds of government officials quietly leaving, and the police also going on strike. All banks were closed, and everyone was indignant at the five-year foreign supervision. Soon, large slogans were posted everywhere, denouncing the supervision plan as a communist conspiracy. A mass meeting hosted by right-wing groups has passed a resolution opposing foreign supervision, demanding immediate recognition of the Korean Provisional Government, and ordering all government officials to go on strike. Newspapers that oppose this resolution are ordered to cease publication, and all political parties are dissolved. Hodge still earnestly warned the newspapers, saying that true patriots do not need to fear the Moscow resolution.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 30th] MacArthur issued a special statement tonight, saying that he had expressed his disagreement with the new measures to control Japan two months ago, and since then "no one has sought my opinion." The Associated Press Washington telegram to the Far East Advisory Council's news officer, saying that MacArthur knew in advance about the plan decided by the Moscow Conference and did not object to it, was denied by MacArthur, who said that the claim that the Moscow Conference consulted with him was misleading and needed to be corrected. In short, I bear no responsibility for this decision, but regardless of the pros and cons of this plan, I will do my best to try it out within the scope of my authority to make it work. The problem caused by this matter is of great importance to the future of the world, and it should not be taken lightly. All relevant parties must act in good faith so as not to encounter insurmountable obstacles. MacArthur also said that he had notified the Army-Navy Joint Staff established by the State Department by radio on October 31, stating that the proposed plan was "absolutely unacceptable." MacArthur's statement tonight did not specifically point out which items in the new plan he was dissatisfied with, but it was heard that it was the item that the other participating countries of the Control Committee were given veto power, which he believed would only cause constraints.</p>

<h3>Hitler's Will and Marriage Contract Found, Voluntarily Died with His Wife to Avoid Humiliation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 30th] With the assistance of British military police, US counterintelligence personnel found a trunk in a German country cottage thirty miles south of Munich. When opened, Hitler's will, Hitler's political testament to the German people, and Hitler's marriage certificate with Eva Braun were found in it. The dates of the documents were all April 29, three days before the Red Army captured Berlin. When announcing this discovery, General Truscott, commander of the US Third Army, stated that some of the documents found still need to be investigated and are not convenient to publish at present. From these documents, one can imagine the state of the last days of the Nazis, which is of inestimable value. I guarantee the authenticity of these documents with my honor. British and American military authorities have been searching for Hitler's will for a long time. The trunk storing the will was found under the bed in the home of Bormann's adjutant, Bostin's girlfriend.</p>
<p>In his personal will, Hitler showed that he never gave up hope that Germany could win the final victory. Even after Soviet shells fell on Berlin, Hitler was still obsessed. However, Hitler and his mistress, Eva, had decided to die to avoid the shame of being forced to resign or surrender. In his political will, Hitler drafted a new cabinet, preparing to continue the war after his death. Although Hitler and Eva had many years of friendship, they only married in Berlin under fire on April 29, 1945, with Wagner as the officiant. Wagner wrote on the marriage certificate: "The parties declared that they were of Aryan blood. Due to the tense war situation and the special circumstances, both parties applied for marriage in accordance with wartime law."</p>

<h3>In the Advancing Sound of the National Army Reclaiming the Territory - A Retrospective on the Fate of the Northeast (Part Two)</h3>
<p>[Draft from this newspaper's data room] For decades, the enemy Japan has been not only an aggressor of Chinese territory but also a disruptor of world peace. Furthermore, each act of aggression and disruption has violated international treaties and good faith, launching sudden attacks that have taken various countries by surprise, and invariably shifting the responsibility for the attacks onto the victims.</p>
<p>Undeclared War, Violation of Treaties and Bad Faith</p>
<p>As early as July 1894, Japan "invented" the act of "undeclared war" by sinking a transport ship carrying 1,200 of our soldiers, and then ambushing our small fleet in Yashawan. At that time, we were caught off guard due to the suddenness of the event, resulting in heavy losses, which led to defeat, the loss of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which have only now been recovered, and were even forced to recognize Korea's independence, placing it under Japanese rule, and forced to compensate for "losses". Ten years later (in 1904), the Japanese fleet suddenly sailed into Port Lushun and began military action against Tsarist Russia without declaring war, bombarding the Lushun forts.</p>
<p>Tsarist Russia Took the Lead in Forced Leases and Borrowing</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the suffering of the Northeast. Of course, we must also trace back to another period of suffering. On March 27, 1898, when China and Russia signed the Liaodong Peninsula Lease Treaty, Tsarist Russia had already forcibly leased and borrowed Lushun and Dalian from our country. The Russian Emperor seemed to be patting the Chinese people on the shoulder, saying, "This is His Majesty the Chinese Emperor's 'wise decision'!" At the same time, he said in a child-like manner, "This act does not harm China's sovereignty and territorial integrity!" We can say that the people of the Northeast had already been suffering from that time, and with this invasion by the Japanese Navy, they suffered another layer of oppression.</p>
<p>It was not until the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance on August 25th of this year, which stipulated that "all administrative power in Dalian belongs to China" and "civil administration in Lushun is under Chinese jurisdiction," that our government and people breathed a sigh of relief after a long period of pent-up anger.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1931, Japan's undeclared war broke out again. Using the "September 18th Incident" as an excuse, the arrogant Kwantung Army invaded Shenyang, the central area of the Northeast, and then invaded the interior of the Northeast, finally swallowing the entire Northeast into the greedy and insatiable mouth of the robber.</p>
<p>The United States Aided China with Righteous Struggle</p>
<p>At this time, the United States rose up righteously, maintaining a firm attitude of non-recognition of the puppet Manchukuo. During this time, the US's export trade to the Northeast fell sharply.</p>
<p>The Northeast spent another six years in such a miserable state, and Japan then revealed its beastly ambition to swallow our entire country, which led to the situation after the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, lasting for eight years. During this period, the United States consistently supported our country, firmly advocating that "the Japanese army must withdraw from China." However, Japan still refused to repent, and instead suddenly bombed the US fleet at Pearl Harbor, thus opening the curtain of the Pacific War, which laid the foundation for Japan's surrender.</p>
<p>The United States Emphasized Integrity of the Northeast</p>
<p>Regarding the Northeast, there has never been a special treaty between China and the United States. In general, in the early stages, the United States repeatedly declared equal commercial opportunities, while also declaring the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty in the Northeast. Later, the two countries signed a road construction loan contract, with the railway and its income as collateral for the loan. In the later stages (after 1905), the United States only advocated the principle of the open door in the Northeast. Apart from maintaining its agreed interests, its relationship with our country always maintained a friendly attitude.</p>
<p>Britain Prioritized Commerce in the Northeast</p>
<p>Britain's policy in the Northeast was generally in line with that of the United States. Although it had considered its commercial interests and sent a delegation to the puppet Manchukuo for industrial surveys, it did not have any ambition to covet the Northeast. Only the ambitious Japan tried its best to suppress Britain, causing it to return disappointed, in order to realize its dream of monopolizing the Northeast and even all of China.</p>
<p>The dream of the ambitious was finally shattered under the axe of justice. Japan had no choice but to surrender to our country and the Allied countries with its shattered dream. It vomited out the Northeast, which it had half swallowed, from its powerless mouth. This was tantamount to a heavy blow to any country in the world whose ambition had not yet been extinguished!</p>
<p>The wounded Northeast will undoubtedly receive the necessary comfort and treatment, so that it can return to the embrace of its motherland, healthy and grown up.</p>

<h3>Perpetrators of the Incident Will Be Severely Punished - Movie Theaters Reopened Last Night - Mayor Tie Expresses Regret in His Speech</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Yesterday, various newspapers published a notice from all movie theaters in this city, stating that they could not bear the disturbances caused by unruly soldiers. On the 23rd of this month, employees of the Grand Shanghai, Nanjing, Lido, and Three Theaters were beaten and injured. On the 28th of this month, in addition to beating and injuring Manager Shi Yanpan of the Huguang Theater, the theater's property and equipment were also destroyed. In protest against such violent actions and to express deep sympathy for the injured colleagues, it was decided that all movie theaters in the city would close for one day yesterday in order to attract the attention of the Party, Government, Military, and Police authorities, as well as people from all walks of life, and to effectively prevent such incidents. Therefore, yesterday, on Sunday, no movie theaters in the city were open for movies in the afternoon or evening. However, in the evening, all movie theaters resumed their evening screenings in compliance with the order of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. It is reported that the relevant authorities have begun to discuss measures for soldiers to watch movies in the future, so that such unfortunate incidents will not happen again, so as to protect the interests of legitimate businessmen.</p>
<p>It is Inappropriate Not to Report First</p>
<p>Mayor Qian issued a speech regarding the decision of all movie theaters in the city to close for one day, as follows: I read the news that all movie theaters in the city closed for one day, stating that they could not bear being beaten. I express my regret. It was found that the Songhu Garrison Headquarters had arrested nine people for the Huguang Theater incident on the 28th, and I have ordered a strict investigation and punishment. The Movie Association Preparatory Committee did not report to the Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, but abruptly decided to close for one day. Although it is not a political strike, it is also inappropriate in law. Now, on the one hand, the Garrison Headquarters is ordered to severely punish the perpetrators and rectify discipline; on the other hand, the Social Affairs Bureau is ordered to summon the responsible persons of the association to make legal corrections. In the future, no matter what kind of organization, they should make reasonable appeals in accordance with legal procedures, otherwise, they should be severely punished together as a warning to those who obstruct social order.</p>
<p>Persuasion to Resume Business Yields Satisfactory Results</p>
<p>The Movie Industry Association convened a meeting of the responsible persons of various movie theaters at the Majestic Theater yesterday to discuss and decide to voluntarily suspend performances and request the authorities to handle the matter. In order to maintain law and order and rectify military discipline, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters sent personnel to investigate the truth and handle the matter thoroughly. It was learned that the Garrison Headquarters sent Chief Cheng Yiming of the Inspection Department to handle the matter yesterday morning. Chief Cheng personally went to the residence of Liang Qitian, chairman of the Movie Association, on Lafayette Road. The association's legal advisor Zhu Qichao and industry colleague Kuang Baorong were present. Chief Cheng expressed that in order to maintain order in the city and allow the five million citizens to enjoy entertainment on holidays, the military and political authorities requested Chairman Liang to persuade colleagues to voluntarily resume business. As for the stray soldiers who caused the incident, the Garrison Headquarters will severely punish them to protect the legitimate interests of each theater. In the past, the Garrison Headquarters has repeatedly issued orders to the heads of various military agencies and units to strictly prohibit soldiers from disturbing theaters and has properly formulated various effective measures to prevent such incidents. The results of the discussion were very satisfactory. Mr. Liang agreed to inform his colleagues that they would do their best to continue showing movies as usual so that the citizens of Shanghai could still enjoy legitimate recreation on Sundays.</p>
<p>Disturbances Continue to Occur</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] At the China Theater on Niuzhuang Road at 8:30 last night, the upper-level reserved seats in the gallery were occupied by several soldiers. Later, as ordinary moviegoers arrived one after another, the theater staff cautiously requested the soldiers to give up their seats, but to no avail. Suddenly, they arbitrarily beat the staff, causing a disturbance. The theater authorities immediately telegraphed the Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau to send police officers and patrol teams to rush to suppress the incident, but it was ineffective. Then, the sub-bureau chief reported the information to the Inspection Department of the General Bureau, which dispatched a police car and the entire gendarmerie, setting up posts on all sides. Some of the military police and gendarmes took all the soldiers without movie tickets in the theater to the Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau, totaling approximately two hundred people. The patrol team requested instructions from Deputy Commander Li and escorted them all to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall Employee Badly Beaten</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] At the Jinshan Dance Hall at 678 Hankou Road, Chen, a former puppet official, led fifteen or sixteen people in naval uniforms and surrounded Zhang Zhifu, the dance hall's manager, and beat him severely. They also smashed tables, chairs, and glass cups, causing chaos. The dance patrons all fled in panic. When the Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau sent a police car to the scene, they arrested Chen and took him to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee Established for the Establishment of a Peace Museum</h3>
<p>The museum planned by the Municipal Government and the Third War Area held its first meeting at the former Japanese Residence Office in this city yesterday at 4:00 p.m. More than twenty people attended. Chairman Sun Yuanliang reported on the progress of the preparations, and then discussions began. The following decisions were made: (1) The museum will be named the Peace Museum; (2) The Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau will be requested to allocate houses for the museum's site; (3) Wang Guanghan, Gu Yuxiu, and five others will be elected as standing committee members; (4) The preparatory expenses are tentatively set at one million yuan; (5) The Ministry of Education will be requested to put the project on record; (6) All parties will be requested to supply victory items; (7) The preparatory committee's address will be temporarily located at the Japanese Residence Office.</p>
<h3>Merchants Allowed Free Passage for Goods Transportation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously received a petition from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating that merchants transporting goods from warehouses or loading and unloading at stations and wharves should be allowed free passage by the Police Bureau, exempting them from inspections along the way. After receiving the order, the Police Bureau has instructed all sub-bureaus to comply.</p>
<h3>Yinqian (Silver and Money) Businesses Not Allowed to Use Pseudonyms for New Accounts</h3>

Stores, companies, and factories must indicate the name of the person in charge in addition to the name of the business. Violators will be subject to penalties.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang to Perform Again - Fundraising for Seafarers' Welfare Fund</h3>

<h3>Police Chief Xuan Tiewu - Inspected Shops' Flag Hanging Yesterday - Flagpole Installation Still Needs Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, shops in all districts of the city uniformly tried hanging the national flag under the instructions of the Municipal Police Bureau. Therefore, after 8:00 a.m., the bright flags of the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth" could be seen flying all over the city. Police Chief Xuan Tiewu personally took a car to travel through the bustling streets to see if the installed flagpoles were still at the right height. The inspection results were considered satisfactory, but Mr. Xuan believed that the angle of inclination during the installation of the iron poles still needed to be improved because the flags, due to the influence of wind force, were often rolled up in one place, which was unsightly.</p>
<h3>The Huaimaru Ship Attacked Near Hupu</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Jianmaru ship, carrying two iron barges loaded with 8,700 large bags of military rice, arrived at the port on the 25th. It was reported that the ship sailed from Wuha on the 17th. When it sailed near Hupu on the morning of the 24th, it was suddenly attacked by more than a hundred bandits. After the ship's escorts fought back bravely, they managed to repel the bandits after a fierce battle of half an hour. The ship and the rice were safe, but one of the escorts was shot in the head and seriously injured. It is reported that the safety issues of the Yangtze River downstream near-sea voyage have attracted the attention of the relevant parties.</p>
<p>British Shipping Company Plans to Resume Operations</p>
<p>The British Far East Shipping Management Office, which is a joint venture of eight British shipping companies in this city, including Jardine Matheson, Changxing, Baohe, Mahler, Blue Funnel, Yitai, Yihuo, and Taikoo, is managed by the British Embassy. It will expire in March next year and will be returned for self-management. Therefore, Jardine Matheson Shipping Company has been actively preparing for the resumption of operations and is still renovating its original site at 27 the Bund. It is expected to start operations after the New Year's holiday. Changxing Shipping Company also has a communications office at its original site on the left side of Jardine Matheson Building. The remaining companies, except for Jardine Matheson and Taikoo, whose offices have already been restored, are also actively planning to resume operations.</p>
<h3>Security Council Received Firearms</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen its equipment and defend local security, the Municipal Security Council received a considerable number of light and heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, rifles, and ammunition from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. These weapons were all surrendered by the enemy after their surrender and are about three-eighths or four-fourths complete and new. They will be distributed to various district groups.</p>
<h3>City Electricity Prices to be Adjusted Again; Additional Charge of Twelve Yuan Per Unit</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company and others, citing the expiration of the trial period for electricity price adjustments and attributing it to high coal prices and insufficient revenue, have petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to approve another adjustment to electricity prices. The bureau, considering the situation, reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Government and submitted it to the first Municipal Advisory Committee for discussion. The previous electricity price adjustment was based on an estimated coal price of 10,000 yuan per ton. Currently, the price per catty of coal is approaching 20,000 yuan, according to the instructions of the Fuel Committee. Even considering the value of the Power Company's coal reserves, the average price per ton has reached 16,500 yuan. It is proposed to levy a uniform coal price fee on each level of electricity price to provide subsidies. The calculation method is that for every 1,000 yuan increase in the price of coal per ton, the electricity price per unit at each level can be increased by two yuan. Since the price of coal has increased from the estimated 10,000 yuan to 16,500 yuan, which is an increase of 6,000 yuan per ton, an additional coal price fee of twelve yuan per unit can be levied uniformly on all levels of electricity consumption in the city, according to the above standard. However, if the price of coal decreases in the future, this surcharge will be reduced proportionally. Furthermore, after the implementation of this new method, all small electricity consumers, if they do not have enough electricity, can state their reasons and directly write to the relevant company in charge to request to be changed to large consumers. The company should not refuse on any pretext, so as to be fair. It is reported that this method has been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and will be implemented from January 10, 1946 (i.e., for the electricity consumed from December 10, 1945), and the bureau has notified the electricity companies to comply.</p>
<h3>Second Area Command Headquarters to Cease Operations on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Zhang Jie, the commander of the Second Area Command of the Air Force, who arrived in Shanghai on the first plane after the victory, is scheduled to return to Chongqing next month, and his Second Area Command Headquarters will cease operations on New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3>Winter Business Tax to be Collected Soon</h3>
<p>The city's business tax, since the establishment of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai, has been announced to be collected quarterly. Now that winter is coming to an end, all winter business taxes after October 21, 1945, should be reported and paid according to the law. The bureau is now actively preparing, and it is reported that it will begin to promote this after the New Year.</p>
<h3>Resource Commission's Shanghai Office to Take Over Industrial Plans</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Resources Committee is currently undertaking a large-scale takeover plan for various major industries. When this plan is implemented, it will take over the industrial department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs that received enemy and puppet properties. The director of the office is Mr. Xia Xianjiang. It is reported that the following departments will be organized in this plan: (1) Shanghai Materials Supply Office, (2) Electrical Equipment Factory, (3) Shanghai Machinery Factory, (4) Shanghai Shipyard, (5) Shanghai Oil Refinery, (6) Jiangnan Electric Bureau, (7) Shanghai Chemical Plant, (8) Shanghai Branch of Taiwan Sugar Refinery, (9) Foreign Trade Affairs Office, (10) Central China Mining Company, (11) China Radio Materials Company, etc.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Model Airplanes Competed in a Performance Yesterday</h3>
<p>The first model airplane competition organized by the China Aviation Model Research Association was held yesterday at the square of Hongkou Park. More than a hundred model airplanes of various types performed various demonstrations. Among them, three motor-powered airplanes took off and circled in the sky for about 20 minutes after the engine started, winning continuous praise from the audience. The participants in this competition included many Allied and National Army soldiers.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Tongfu Road; Bandits Captured on the Spot</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At around 11:00 AM yesterday, four bandits, all wearing military uniforms and three of them armed with firearms, broke into the home of Lu Munan, who runs a paper business at No. 8 Xinhua Lane, Tongfu Road. They robbed 3 million legal tender and two gold bars. Neighbors reported this to the Xincheng Branch Bureau, which surrounded and captured the bandits, seized live ammunition and firearms, and handed them over to the patrol team to be escorted to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>
<p>Ms. Li Xu, a young woman residing at No. 421 Yuyao Road, attended a wedding banquet at the Dahongyun Restaurant in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, on the 29th. At around 10:00 PM, she returned home and was suddenly followed into her house by three robbers, who brandished pistols. They robbed her of a gold bracelet, two gold rings, and a woman's coat before fleeing.</p>
<h3>Ideal Level Reached; Year-End Cleaning Concluded; Nanshi and Zhabei Less Clean</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, based on the reports of the 57 working groups dispatched by the Cleaning Service Group, stated that the cleanliness of the streets in the urban area has reached an ideal level after this year-end cleaning. However, the cleanliness of Nanshi and Zhabei districts is far behind the former concession areas due to the damage caused by the enemy and puppets during their occupation, as well as the lack of manpower and resources, making it difficult to remove the accumulated dirt in places such as the Nanshi Temple.</p>
<p>The cleanliness of the alleys in the urban area is still lacking. The reasons are as follows: (1) Most alleys lack garbage bins, and those that exist are damaged and unusable. (2) Although there are garbage bins in the alleys, residents do not follow the rules and arbitrarily dump garbage, leaving it outside the bins. (3) There is often no one responsible for sweeping in the alleys. (4) Stalls are set up at the entrances of alleys, obstructing traffic, preventing garbage carts from entering to work.</p>
<p>The observation team also expressed agreement with the above points. The publicity for this cleaning campaign was satisfactory. In addition to the Health Bureau printing and sending 50,000 copies of the "Notice to Citizens" and "Citizen's Guide" on cleaning, as well as cleaning slogans, to the police局轉各分局轉各分局 for distribution to all citizens, newspapers and radio stations also engaged in publicity. Furthermore, cleaning slogans are still being shown in all cinemas in the city to promote public awareness of relevant matters.</p>
<h3>Relief for Unemployed Workers; Planning Work-for-Relief Programs</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Lu Jingshi, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the unemployment problem is still serious, and passive relief is not a thorough solution. Therefore, the relief association is actively planning "work-for-relief" programs to fundamentally solve the problem. The reasons why factories have not been able to resume work are nothing more than a lack of fuel and raw materials, as well as restrictions on capital exchange rates, and the fact that transportation has not been restored is the crux of the problem. It is hoped that the relevant competent authorities will quickly seek solutions.</p>
<h3>Wu Xingbo Passes Away in Shanghai</h3>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Gold and Banknotes Rose Together Last Week; Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Closed at High Prices</h3>
<p>Last week, Shanghai's financial situation was that the lunar New Year was approaching, and it was the period for banks and money shops to close their accounts and pay interest. Money was nominally stable but secretly tight. The daily interest rate for one thousand yuan was nominally hung at three corners, i.e., nine yuan per month. The secret interest rate, because of the new high prices of Chinese and foreign stocks, increased the demand for funds, rose from eight cents to eleven cents five mils, i.e., one hundred and five yuan per month per thousand yuan, which was two and a half cents higher than the previous week. Hot red bricks rose due to the upward trend of the US dollar. Gold shops and Sichuan banks purchased them. Although the purchase price by the Chongqing Central Bank retreated from 85,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan, the Shanghai market broke through the 800,000 yuan mark, with a peak of 831,000 yuan on Friday. Subsequently, due to the cutting of long positions by the paper and yarn merchants, it retreated to 813,000 yuan, an increase of 61,000 yuan compared to the previous week. The US dollar rose because the import of foreign goods increased daily. Importers still lacked the use of foreign exchange and could only absorb as many US dollars as possible. At the same time, the definite orders for Western medicines and chemical raw materials from the Western pharmaceutical industry and chemical raw material merchants were about to arrive, so they also pre-settled in US dollars, causing the market price to remain high at 1,430 yuan, an increase of 175 yuan compared to the previous week, despite the appearance of a large number of new twenty-dollar US dollars and Hawaiian US notes on the market. The Hong Kong dollar rose because the Hong Kong government restored all exchange transactions, and the exchange rate against the British pound was easier than the exchange rate against the US dollar. Guangbang banks successively purchased them, and old goods returned to a high of 260 yuan, only 20 yuan lower than the peak of 280 yuan in November. New goods also rose to 73 yuan, an increase of 17 yuan compared to the previous week, which was about 30% weaker than old goods.</p>
<p>Unified public bonds, due to the good negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the good situation in the Northeast, the gold and yarn merchants absorbed type C bonds, hovering around the 800 yuan mark, and finally closed at 770 yuan, an increase of 70 yuan compared to the previous week. Securities firms, due to the equal understanding of the unified prices of types A, B, C, D, and E bonds, and the cheapness of the current market discount, sold type C bonds one after another and bought types A, B, D, and E. Chinese stocks, due to the active floating capital, were frequently purchased by banks and money shops and gold merchants. In addition, with the call for the resumption of securities trading, large and small popular stocks all closed at new high prices. The leading Yongan Yarn Factory reached 820 yuan, an increase of 110 yuan compared to the previous week, which was more than double the peak of 78,000 fake currency per share when the Japanese surrendered on August 10. Foreign stocks, due to the fierce purchase by gold merchants, Guangbang and the banking industry, believed that foreign stocks had a close value to foreign exchange and that foreign merchants would never let go. Jardine Matheson, Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, and Taikoo Dockyard all closed at new high prices, even higher than the peak in early November, which was in line with this newspaper's prediction last week.</p>
<h3>Huge Amount of Banknotes Arrived from New York</h3>
<p>[Special report from this newspaper] 3,680 boxes of banknotes, shipped from New York on the American ship "Satireden" (transliteration), arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The banknotes are the first import after the victory. The Fulaie Shipping Company has notified the Bank of China to pick them up.</p>
<h3>Many Reorganizations in the Woolen Industry</h3>
<p>[Special report from this newspaper] Yesterday was Sunday, and the woolen market was slack. Moreover, it was the end of the lunar year, so it was even more lonely. Therefore, in addition to checking inventory and being busy with the final closing, there were very few sales. Many shops in the same industry have been reorganized this year due to the capital relationship between true and false currencies, and the increasingly difficult business in the future. According to surveys, those who have closed down account for 50-60%, those who have expanded and increased capital account for 20-30%, and those who have merged with each other account for 10-20%. In the past, there were more than 400 member stores in the woolen industry organization in the puppet organization, but now there are less than 300 who have formally joined the industry association after reorganization.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The sales of knitting yarn have slightly improved, and there are also sporadic shipments to other ports. Prices have stabilized, and a deal for 14,000 yuan for a popular color of Bee Brand coarse yarn has been made.</p>
<p>Not much of the new Lanhua rice was produced this year. As transportation has not yet recovered, several shipments have been transported by motorized sailing ships until recently. Samples were seen yesterday.</p>
<p>Due to the small number of new goods of dried lily flowers, they are sold as soon as they arrive, and the number plates are firm. It is not easy to loosen them for a while. Forty or so baskets of Longxi narcissus flower heads have also been transported in.</p>
<p>Since the price drop once, the sales of cosmetics have not improved. White oil and Vaseline have even fallen by more than half. Due to the time involved, skin creams have generally risen without falling.</p>
<h3>How to Convert Book Capital; Central and Local Governments Will Decide</h3>
<p>[Special report from this newspaper] The question of how to convert industrial and commercial capital is highly related to tax revenue. It is heard that in terms of business tax in this city, after several discussions, some people have proposed to convert it on a one-to-one basis, that is, one yuan of puppet currency should be changed to one yuan of legal currency, but because it is a major matter, no decision has been made yet. It is also heard that the central government will make a decision on this, largely based on the three suggestions provided by the local association of certified public accountants.</p>
<h3>Not Many Foreign Orders for Hardware</h3>
<p>[Special report from this newspaper] Foreign orders for hardware were quite active at first. The industry in this city competed to order, so those who sent telegrams to inquire about prices did so dozens of times a day. However, overseas replies were either because the market was higher, or because the shipment was too late, or because the exchange procedures were troublesome. Therefore, the number of completed transactions was very small. It is heard that Baohua, Hanili, New Shichang, Weili, and Hanyi Lung and other foreign firms have placed orders for a total of only four to five hundred tons, of which about 40% were purchased by the same industry, and about 60% were purchased by factories. The prices of each product are extracted below: (Unit: ton)</p>

<h3>Spiritual Construction and the Art Movement</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>(This article is the manuscript for a lecture given at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station of the Central Broadcasting Affairs Management Office on the 28th of this month)</p>
<p>Now that the violence of the world has been eliminated, the future efforts should focus on preventing the resurgence of violence to maintain lasting peace for mankind. On the other hand, the highly materialistic 20th century must also focus on the construction of spiritual civilization, especially the importance of spiritual construction in our country, which exceeds that of material construction. This will completely eliminate all selfishness, suspicion, jealousy, cowardice... and many other inferior traits. To achieve this goal, we can only elevate art, the highest spiritual activity of mankind, to cultivate a life of truth, goodness, and beauty. Because for mankind, all tangible behaviors and intangible consciousness originate from truth, which is also goodness, and also beauty. Conversely, beautiful stimuli can create good reactions, leading to the expression of truth. In this way, all mankind will only have truth, no falsehood; only goodness, no evil; only beauty, no ugliness; only love, no hatred. Everyone will not only share material abundance but also share spiritual joy, joining hands to enter the realm of world harmony. Therefore, to promote the noble ideals of a life of truth, goodness, and beauty, to cultivate a spirit of mutual affection, joy, and brightness, and to establish lasting peace for mankind, this is the necessary foundation for spiritual construction.</p>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese people have been constrained by reality and oppressed by material things, resulting in the loss of the inherent freedom of human nature, the decline of the spirit, and the chaos of society, all of which exhibit backwardness and morbidity. In this great era, we must certainly strive for the construction of economy, military affairs, science, politics, and education. However, we must not neglect art and culture, because it is the first step in spiritual construction.</p>
<p>Humans are inherently endowed with the ability to appreciate beauty and the ability to create. Because beautiful forms seek solace for the soul and achieve many ideals of changing personality and enhancing social happiness, it is more appropriate to say that the construction of social art and culture is a matter of urgency in the process of national construction, rather than saying that the importance of spiritual construction exceeds material construction.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, our country has made immortal achievements and contributions to spiritual culture. The achievements in art truly surpass those of Europe and America. However, due to the lack of proper preservation and development, they have almost been lost. This prevents researchers from imagining, tracing, and deepening their studies based on the relics of the past, and the public has no opportunity to come into contact with them, leading to a life of stagnation and helplessness. Instead, others are allowed to overstep their bounds and take their place, which is truly heartbreaking to say!</p>
<p>Now that the Anti-Japanese War is won, our country is one of the world's four major powers, and international cooperation has become very close. In this era of national construction, the facilities for art are certainly urgently needed. Here, I offer my humble suggestions for consideration. The so-called art facilities are the development of the art movement. Here, I propose four concrete suggestions. If they can be implemented effectively, not only can Chinese art and culture be revived, but spiritual construction can also be established from this.</p>
<p>One. The Organization and Establishment of Museums</p>
<p>Every major city, town, village, and city in Europe and America has museums that display ancient artistic masterpieces as well as modern masterpieces. This kind of facility not only enhances the public's aesthetic interest but also provides convenience for scholars and antique enthusiasts to study. The management of museums, such as collection, management, display, cataloging, mending, and preservation, has become a specialized science, employing precise methods. Famous examples include the Louvre Museum in France and the British Museum in England, which are truly well-organized and spectacular.</p>
<p>In various parts of our country, there are a few simple museums or ancient artifact preservation centers, but they are all perfunctory and disorganized. There are no reports or statistics, and there are frequent rumors of ancient artifacts being stolen, which is truly a laughing stock for both domestic and foreign observers. Therefore, for the existing museums and ancient artifact preservation centers, not only should we find ways to restore and enrich them, but we should also operate them entirely using scientific methods, which should not be neglected in the future. Secondly, the establishment of museums or ancient artifact preservation centers should be determined according to the standards of transportation and population. Therefore, I believe that cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Qingdao, Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an should build large-scale modern museums as soon as possible. At the very least, the existing ancient artifact preservation centers should be expanded and improved to store artistic treasures. In addition, the artistic antiques recovered from Japan can be displayed separately. If there are immovable objects such as statues from past dynasties, tomb towers, and reliefs, experts should be asked to make replicas and distribute them to museums around the country for display. This will provide opportunities for universal viewing and research.</p>
<p>Two. Art Galleries and Music Concerts</p>
<p>Museums are fixed and permanent display places for artworks, while "art galleries" are places where artworks are regularly changed, introduced, and exhibited. Our country held the first National Art Exhibition in the eighteenth year and the second National Art Exhibition in the twenty-sixth year. The National Art Exhibition was interrupted due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Although there are many reasons for this, the lack of art galleries to use may be the most important one. When preparing for the first National Art Exhibition, I was ordered to go to Europe for inspection. At that time, the venue was the China National Products Hall on Guohuo Road in Shanghai, and its unreasonableness was to be expected. Although the venue problem for the Second National Art Exhibition held at the National Art Gallery in Nanjing was more reasonable, there were still many shortcomings. Therefore, major cities should establish reasonable "art galleries" as soon as possible, regularly exhibiting artistic works from ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign, from various schools of art, so that the public has appropriate places to view art, and modern artists have appropriate places to exhibit their works, which is of great help to the future development of art.</p>
<p>The dissemination of spatial arts such as painting and sculpture relies on "art galleries," while the dissemination of temporal arts such as music requires concerts. Concerts should be held regularly to introduce world-famous pieces. The prices should be reduced to popularize the opportunity for the public to appreciate music. Under the leadership of the government, each region should have organizations and activities like Shanghai's large-scale symphony orchestra.</p>
<p>Three. Establishment of the National Academy of Fine Arts</p>
<p>Examining the art facilities in various European and American countries, the scale is grand and the meaning is profound. It is actually managed by the National Academy of Fine Arts. Here, the government selects famous artists and scholars as members to plan the direction and methods of national art education and social art facilities, as well as the consultation and research of art undertakings. The main undertakings include museums, art schools, music schools, national regular exhibitions, art scholarships, etc. Although the systems vary from country to country, the purpose is the same. During this period of revival in our country, it is indeed necessary to establish a National Academy of Fine Arts in imitation. With this organization, the national art facilities can be planned and organized in a unified manner, without being shifted by the interests of one person or one family, and the efficiency of achieving twice the result with half the effort can be achieved.</p>
<p>Four. Artification of Urban Construction</p>
<p>Our country defeated the violent Japanese in this eight-year Anti-Japanese War. Due to international cooperation and the support of allies, the construction undertakings in various regions will inevitably change with each passing day, and the modernization of cities is an inevitable trend. I have traveled in Europe twice and experienced the large and small cities of various countries. After wandering and observing, I feel that each place has its own unique characteristics. The display of these characteristics is all tied to the artification of construction. The artification of construction is not difficult. As long as the designers can pay attention to the interests of the times and the geographical situation, and arrange public and private buildings to form an organic structure, avoiding all unreasonable and scattered forms, and taking pleasing the eye as the standard everywhere, then beauty will come naturally without seeking it. In the past, the urban construction of our country did not imitate old rules, and foreigners were in charge, resulting in something that was neither Chinese nor Western, neither mule nor horse. When engaging in construction now, attention should be paid to the artification of cities, so that the public feels happy in life and feels appropriate in appearance. The authorities engaged in construction will certainly agree with this point of view.</p>
<h3>Mist</h3>
<p>— Sultan</p>
<p>In a letter to a friend, I wrote:</p>
<p>"Who is leading me onto this thorny rose path, where even cherishing the blood of youth is impossible? I would rather exchange life for a drop of clear tears than walk on this misty road, but what's the use? I bear the heavy burden of emotion."</p>
<p>Yes, I bear the heavy burden of emotion, walking on the thorny road. I want to find something, but what am I looking for? Is it a cold kiss, or a faint smile? Do I need these?</p>
<p>I don't know if these can warm me?</p>
<p>One should not be fooled by emotions, one must restrain oneself, one must cherish the glowing passion, but who can escape the lying mouth and the deceiving eyes? Knowing that what is dazzling you is a beautiful lie, but wasting passion here, why? Is it the contradiction of life or one's own clumsiness?</p>
<p>I don't understand, I have no way to explain, no way to clear this mist. This is an unfathomable mystery.</p>
<p>But I know that the energy of life should not be spent on some small things, especially when young. The blood of youth should be as precious as morning dew.</p>
<p>But, what can make me firm?</p>
<p>Life and thought are in contradictory pursuit. Having read many biographies, many successful great men and the lives and thoughts of failures, I know how they spin in the mist, how they walked through the misty road, gaining light and life, but what did I get? So empty, is it my own insignificance? Loneliness surrounds me like an endless desert, perhaps because I have too much hope and too many green dreams?</p>
<p>Although I am spinning in the mist, enduring some ridicule, I trust myself that I will not fall in the mist, because those who understand their own failures are not far from success.</p>
<p>I trust myself, I have such confidence: although bearing the heavy burden of emotion, one day I will pass through this heavy misty road.</p>
<h3>Ink Vegetables</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>This vegetable never reaches the vermilion gate, difficult to equate with mountain delicacies; only I, a scholar, am poor to the bone, morning and evening, use it as a side dish.</p>
<p>The ancients always loved the fragrance of vegetable roots, moreover, grain has been scarce in recent years; even if it is sold by the load in the street, a thousand gold coins cannot fill my worried stomach.</p>
<h3>Brushstrokes of History</h3>
<h3>Talking About "Circles"</h3>
<p>— Xie Dongping</p>
<p>If I were a sheep, I would rather be a sheep outside the Great Wall, because the sheep outside the Great Wall can freely eat the grass it likes in the wilderness of the north. If I were a bird, I would rather be a bird in the sky that flies around the world all day long for its own food.</p>
<p>I despise the sheep that are kept in the fence, they are very tame, do not offer any resistance, just bleat to their masters, trying to get grass feed to maintain their unfree life. I especially despise the "mynas" and "parrots" raised by their masters, they just shout out the sounds their masters like, just sing the songs their masters want them to sing, but they think they are the smartest of the birds.</p>
<p>Everything in the world, things, often have both advantages and disadvantages, both good and evil. For example, a range, it can give you security, it can also make you lose freedom of action. The sheep in the fence, the bird in the cage, naturally do not have to worry about fierce birds and beasts, such as tigers, lions, owls, and birds of prey to hurt them, but they also cannot step out of the fence and cage.</p>
<p>The sheep's fence, the bird's cage, is the "circle" that they cannot surpass in their lives. If there were no fences in the world, sheep, as an animal, would definitely be a very promising animal. Without cages, birds, as an animal, would definitely be the freest animal.</p>
<p>In human society, if there were no "circles," whether ancient or modern, large or small, then everyone would definitely be promising, everyone would be able to give full play to their creative talents, and everyone would be able to live an independent and free life. Everyone wants to be an emperor, and this desire to be an emperor is the "circle" in people's minds in the feudal era. But people are ultimately different from animals, so the person who became an emperor wanted to become an immortal. The person who became an emperor was really not free in the circle of that imperial city, but the immortal could be in the sky or on the ground, and was very free.</p>
<p>When a person's life has not yet formed a "circle," then his future is unlimited. When a "circle" has been formed, then his fate is also determined. Inside the circle, you can never see outside the circle, just like the emperor's extravagance in the imperial city, he can never see the suffering of the people. A parent with a son with a scabby head can never see the advantages of children whose scalps are not scabby.</p>
<p>A sheep kept in a fence and a "myna" raised in a cage by its master will definitely laugh at the sheep outside the Great Wall and the birds in the sky who are looking for food everywhere on the ground and in the sky, as being foolish.</p>
<p>Human mischief is to create "circles," to create "circles" for sheep, to create "circles" for birds, to create "circles" for themselves. With this "circle," there are sheep, birds, people, people above people, and people below people in the world.</p>
<p>If you want to see real things, if you want to distinguish between true and false, you must jump outside the circle. If there is really foolishness in the world, then this foolishness belongs to the animals in the circle who do not know they are in the circle.</p>
<h3>Social Service</h3>
<h3>Low Salaries Should Be Adjusted Urgently: Couples Who Faithfully Fulfill Their Duties Cannot Get Enough to Eat</h3>
<p>A reader of this newspaper, with the pen name Canzhen, wrote: "Mr. Editor, I have long intended to use a corner of your newspaper to express my grievances, but I always felt unable to pick up the pen. However, because my grievances are really too deep, I must state them to society, not to seek help from society, but to seek guidance from all parties. When I was five years old, both my parents died. After growing up and studying in middle school, I worked as an elementary school teacher for many years. Later, due to difficult living conditions, I changed my job to become an administrator at a large construction factory. At first, the boss was eager to find someone, so he used sweet words to induce me to abandon my teaching position and take up the job. Later, he did not give me food expenses or salary, and I only got three simple meals a day. At first, I endured by pawning and borrowing, but now I have nothing left to pawn and no place to borrow from. As the saying goes, 'Eat everything up, pawn everything off,' I had no choice but to beg the boss. Who knew that the 'tycoon' would threaten me with the tone of a local tyrant and gentry? My wife is now seven months pregnant and works as a single-grade teacher in a small elementary school. She earns only 100,000 fake currency per month, and she is responsible for her own meals, averaging one and a half pancakes a day. We thought we were faithfully fulfilling our duties for the sake of the community and society, but the reward we received was so meager. It can be seen that it is not easy to survive and stand on our own feet. Those who have jobs are still like this, what about those who have no jobs? Now our small family is about to be reduced to beggars. Who should be responsible for this? Please, social leaders, teach me!"</p>
<h3>Respectful Suggestions to the Post Office</h3>
<p>— Fengchichun</p>
<p>The post office is one of the important transportation institutions, and it is in contact with many people every day. Not to mention the past, I think postal workers should pay attention to politeness. Those who serve society should take the spirit of service as the premise, and supplement it with the word "obligation." Otherwise, arrogant behavior and lack of politeness will have a great impact on society. I hope that senior postal officials and senior officials of various branches will pay special attention to this and correct the middle and lower-level employees! Another point is that the glue on the back of the stamps should be thicker. Looking at the glue used recently, there is very little glue, and some have no glue at all. Therefore, the authorities have set up a paste station. I don't know if it is of poor quality or if it has already become moldy, which makes people want to vomit when they smell it. In addition, the edge of the window is covered with long-standing paste dirt. This situation is unsightly and unhygienic. The two points mentioned above seem to be small, but public institutions should not be perfunctory. We hope that during the period of national revival, we can eliminate bad habits and create a new spirit. We also hope that our leaders will pay special attention to the politeness and hygiene of their subordinates and hope that they will be implemented and corrected immediately.</p>
