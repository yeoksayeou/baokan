<h3>日水上特別攻擊隊　出擊沖繩島海面　沉毀敵艦船達三十二艘</h3>
<p>琉球基地十六日中央社電　出擊於冲繩方面之日水上特別攻擊隊，自三月二十八日至五月十三日止，所獲綜合戰果如次：擊沉巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦六艘，大型運轍船二艘，撈海艇七艘，其他艦船十艘，擊毀　海艇一艘（大概已沉沒），運輸船一艘（似已沉沒），類似掃海艇者一艘，起火之艦船不詳者二艘，中型運輸船一艘。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地十六日中央社電日航空部隊卞四日又連續攻擊冲繩附近敵艦船，計擊沉大型輸送船一艘，驅逐艦一艘，並確認地上基地有十八處發生大火。又敵中·北兩機塲，亦遭日機襲擊，有四處起火。</p>
<p>琉球基地十六日中央社電十五日夜，日軍航空部隊攻擊冲繩本島敵飛機塲，數處中彈起火，是日敵機來襲琉球僅百　左右。</p>
<h3>美機會隊受創極重</h3>
<p>西南基地十六日中央社電　據於八重山列島方面被日軍擊落加以逮捕之一英國航空中尉所稱，英國機動部隊，已於五月初旬自烏爾西港出發，與遭日軍猛攻而受重創之南西羣島方面美機動部隊對調，以期增强其勢力。該俘虜謂，美機動部隊受創極爲嚴重，空母勢力已失去其百分之四十五，其他艦艇勢力失去百分之四十九，故與英　　自動提議交替。又自石垣島方面出擊之英艦隊勢力，傳有特設空母二艘，戰艦二艘巡　艦三艘驅逐艦十二艘</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地十六日中央社電　五月十日上午十時，日機於西南太平洋發見知識大型潛水艦浮上海面，乃大舉襲擊，敵潛水艇因命中二彈，海面出現油跡而告沉沒。又十一日下午五時，發見航行中之敵潛水艇二艘日機對春航於前方者加以攻擊。擊中艦尾司令塔江　，未幾即告沉沒。</p>
<h3>沖繩南部戰鬥益劇</h3>
<p>東京十中央社電　沖繩本島戰線之日軍，連日與那　及苜里北方力謀突破日軍陣地，熾列來攻之敵軍展開死鬥，即於十三日夜在那　北方之天久方面，以多數挺身肉摶隊衝入敵陣，使敵陷於混亂狀態，然於十四日夜，對敵軍全線繼續猛攻，其攻勢至十五日仍不見稍緩，戰况益趨激化。在東海岸地區之日軍，仍確保與澤　北方陣地，於陣前迭次粉碎美第七師之攻擊，於中央高地至西海岸戰線之日軍陣地，復有若千處爲敵侵入，首里北郊平良町北方高地澤　地區至末吿北方內間地區，至　嘉部北方，天久地區至那覇東北方之安里方面，均行侵入。尤於那覇北方，以戰艦二艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦五艘，接近那　海岸，於艦砲射擊之掩護下，反復猛攻，但日軍確保各旣設陣地，死守那覇方面之安里及那覇北方陣地，予以邀擊，刻正粉碎敵軍企圖中。敵軍自四月初，於本島登陸以來，入南部地區之敵兵力，已達六師之多，因日軍之勇戰，其第九十六，第二十七二師，悉失戰力，遂行後退。刻下敵第一棧軍爲東海岸地區之第七師，首里北方中央高地之第七十七師及海兵第一師之三師，再於那覇北方有由名護灣方面調移之海兵第六師，計共四師，因日軍銳師之奮勇敢鬥，均受創甚重，本島中部之日軍部隊，現與附近民衆協力繼續勇敢邀擊戰，使敵軍陷於苦境。</p>
<h3>沖繩島敵兵　傷亡數激增</h3>
<p>中央社訊　冲繩戰局現已到達寸土必爭之激烈階段，本島南部地區之敵，似已傾全力開始總攻，然敵雖富於物量，今軍艦與飛機，一再被日軍擊沉，亦不得不洩露其悲觀之情矣。尼米資公報，常發表自軍之損失如何輕微，如據美陸軍發言人H愛里沃少校之言，日機雖每日來攻，冲繩島海岸之美軍設施，並未有何等重大損害。蓋美軍之戰法，爲遮斷輸送路，妨碍日軍之接濟，故敵人自稱冲繩戰鬥並不急於求勝云云，査敵人侵寇冲繩以來，艦船一再被擊沉擊破，總數已達全部戰力之八成。敵人自誇之東亞回航船舶，現已被日軍消滅，因之敵人船團陷入重大混亂中，美第十軍司令官巴古那中將電謂，不能期待多大之成功，又紐約時報之社論亦謂，太平洋戰爭，業已步入脫逸之方向，該地戰鬥過於猛烈，使我人目　心傷，又因戰爭爲混戰，故犧牲之慘重，在所難免云。據情報，冲繩島開始作戰時，敵主力爲第二十五軍團之第九十六師及第二十七師，此二師業已被日軍如數消滅，其他之四軍，亦均滿身瘡痍，焦急之餘，爲求最後一逞，乃有本届總攻擊之舉，溯自冲繩　戰爭開始以來，美國將兵已死亡三千九百六十七名，但以數字，尙非全部，據美第十軍軍醫佛萊特里克，何斯脫魏爾脫上校本月之發表，從來中部太平洋之戰爭，人員損害大致百分之六至百分之八爲死亡，據敵美在歐洲戰爭，其軍方損害率，合死傷兩者僅爲百分之二·八，可知敵人此番侵製冲繩島所受之損失之慘重。關於死亡率如此驚人之理由，何斯脫魏爾脫上校稱，由於太平洋各戰綫野戰病院之不足，截至本月止，冲繩島戰傷之美將士中，有六千人以上，均已用飛機運至後方，此種輸送傷兵計劃，由距離言，實爲本届戰爭中規模最大者。又據該上校之言，歐洲戰塲，其地軍醫院之需要甚大，故太平洋方面之醫藥工作，殊被冷視，僅有守備部隊之野戰病院而已。該上校因歐戰業已吿終，甚望太平洋方面設立基地病院，又稱，冲繩鳥作戰開始最初，美軍損害殊輕，但至今日，每日竟達二，三百人之高率，然病院設備，則舊態依然。冲繩開戰以來，戰鬥人員傷者之死亡率，該上校秘不發表，惟謂本届作戰開始以來，陸軍方面已有二千人以上，海軍方面亦有四千名以上之病兵，用飛機運凹後方，故每日派有十架飛機，從事載運傷病兵工作，預料最近將有增加。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>敵美政治前途的觀察</h3>
<p>在個人的運命上說，特魯曼繼羅斯福而昇任總統，或許是一種僥倖，可是就美國政治的運命來說，由特魯曼來擔任戰時美國的領導者，眞是美國政治的厄運。這厄運是美國憲法第六十條所造成的，雖然美國的官吏議員，國民和前線士兵，都明知這是宿命的「龍袍加身」把戲，然而因爲憲法的規定，實是無可奈何的事。</p>
<p>照美國政治上的慣例，在新大總統就任的百日之中，國民盡量避免一切的非難，使國家的新元首能够踏上正常的軌道。特魯曼就任之初，自然不能例外，並且因爲在世界風雲緊急之中，爲減少羅斯福突然逝世後的政治影響起見，對於特魯曼的　任，就是反對黨也不能不敷衍表面，然而事實上，美國國民的政治感覺早已蒙上了一重暗影。</p>
<p>特魯曼總統就任雖未滿百日，可是我們從他就任一月來的情形預測，他的政治前途是崎嶇不平而夫許樂觀的。他在政治上遇到的第一次試煉，便是舊金山會議的開會。美國國民的性情是誇張的，自我優越的，他們對於舊金山會議抱着無限的期待，認爲可以在他們的國土的一部，召集數十國代表，討論支配世界的問題。所以他們對於本國元首的活動，更抱着無限的希望。可是出於意外羅斯福突然逝世，特魯曼不過是「從黑暗中生長起來的平凡的老人」，不能在這世界的舞台上擔任導演的脚色，這使美國的國民普遍的感到失望。</p>
<p>所以特魯曼的政治前途，一方面有着國際政治的危機，一方面又有着國內政治的危機。在國際政治舞台上，老練的羅斯福，在史太林，邱吉爾的面前，尙不能不深切戒備，而特魯曼當然難以站在並駕齊驅的地位，更不用說什麽領導了。這次舊金山會議中，美國態度的軟弱，與蘇代表莫洛托夫發言的强硬，都顯出特　曼人望不足，與政治手腕之缺乏。</p>
<p>在國內的政治上，特魯曼平凡的能力，更不足以控制陸海軍，指揮外交人物，或是應付國會中的各黨各派的議員。羅斯福在第一次歐戰時，便任海軍次官職務，特魯曼那時不過是砲兵大尉；羅斯福能當選四次，執政十二年之久，而特魯曼在一九三四年方才得選爲參議員。他的資望遠不能與羅斯福同日而語。最近，議會中共和黨對於羅斯福遺下的關稅減低案大肆攻擊，這就是特魯曼政治力不足的反映。</p>
<p>特魯曼所以得羅斯福的信任，由於一九三五年擔任上院軍需生產調査委員會委員長以後，對於車需生產不無成效。這樣說來，特魯曼對於美國國家物資的動員似乎可以有把握了，可是現在美國的國民却已在考慮戰後經濟的恢復，特魯曼如再實施强化戰時經濟機構，必然受到實業界的激烈反對。</p>
<p>特魯　就任時說，他是以羅斯福的政策爲政策的，可是，猶之駕馭馬車，雖然是同一途徑，同一馬匹，因爲駕馭者的技術和能力的不同，往往不是因狂奔而致踣躓，便是因遲緩而不能達到原有的理想。特魯曼是平凡的駕馭者。恐怕不能適應環境，不能操縱自己吧。</p>
<p>美國的民主政治近年因為羅斯福把政治力量極力集中，已經趨向獨裁政治之途。愈是在獨裁政治之形態下，政治的領導者必須愈有才能。特魯曼當然不是適常的人選，美國的政治力量必然因此分散，因此失却勢力的均衡。美國國民很偏於感情，輿論相當囂張，不久的將來，特魯曼必將遭遇苛刻非難與强烈批評，這樣美國政治的厄遝將因此愈益深刻。由於國內政治的危機，極可能影響於戰局的變移。總之，因爲特魯曼政治的貧困，美國政治的悲劇，不久必然的暴露於世界。</p>
<h3>各古屋空襲　三百年歷史舊跡遭轟炸化爲灰燼</h3>
<p>名古屋十六日中央社電　集東洋建築精粹與古典壯麗美觀之本丸　殿及五培七重樓上嵌有金　之天主閣，均係三百年歷史之舊跡，不幸於本月十四日上午八時二十分化為灰燼。該日上午八時五分許，敵機擲燒夷彈，一時曾被撲滅，但八時二十分，敵大編隊又大肆轟炸名古屋，素以壯麗豪華見稱之本丸御殿，天主閣，大手門，表二門，清正石門，俱化灰燼，尙未完全疏散之雌雄金　亦同遭火災，惟御殿內所藏之國寶繪　及美術品，除壁畫外，因已移往他處，得未遭刦，對呂　顯明之金　城施行濫炸者，此乃素以文化自誇，而實不解文化為何物之敵美術鬼行為。</p>

<h3>財部負責人闡釋　財政施策現況　穩定金融已漸著成效</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　財政部負責人於十六日下午三時，會見首都中外記者團，對國府財政施策現況，扼要解答。茲分誌大意如下：</p>
<h3>改善公務員待遇</h3>
<p>（問）目下生活日高，對中央公務人員待遇，政府有未考慮改善辦法？（答）政府對公務員待遇問題，向頗關心，惟爲國府整個財政預算所限，當不能與一般物價相提並論，然在可能範圍內，決力謀改善。自下半年度起，對戰時津貼一項，當可再予酌量提高，俾資安定生活，至詳細辦法，刻正在釐訂中。</p>
<h3>金證劵承購踴躍</h3>
<p>（問）金證券發行後，所予國府金融上之影響如何？（答）金證劵之發行，旨在收縮通貨，穩定金融，第一期發行後，由於準備充實，購買者異常踴躍，超出預足數字，收回通貨達一百萬萬之多，成績至爲良好，現第二期亦已準備發行，此在國府安定金融施策上，尙有莫大裨益。（問）戰時消費特稅自於本年一月起，改由各省市地方政府代爲征收後，成績如何？（答）消費特稅自由地方政府代征後，一般成績可稱良好，惟以該項稅收至爲瑣碎繁雜，故各地繳部者頗多參差。</p>
<h3>食鹽運銷之困難</h3>
<p>（問）關於最近食鹽運輸情形如何？（答）目前食鹽產銷之未臻圓滑，並非在產量減少，純為運輸困難，反之產　實較專變前為多，因在戰時下交通不能暢達，致運銷米得圓滑，現鹽務署方面對運輸問題，正與有關各方面積極商洽，力謀改善。</p>
<h3>諸聯劵比率不變</h3>
<p>（問）近外間對中儲券與聯銀券之比率，頗多謠傳，致黑市價格高漲甚多，請問對此問題之意見如何？（答）在現狀下，中儲券與聯銀券之比率決不變動，至黑市高漲，純係一般投機份子作崇所致。</p>
<h3>防止關金券流入</h3>
<p>（問）渝方關金券，最近頗有流入和平地區，此於　府之金融上不無影響，請問財部對此是否已考慮取締對策流入和平地區，本部亦迭有所聞，多由一般單帮小販夾帶而來，其目的僅在利用各地差額，牟取微利，並非故意擾亂金融，且流入數量亦微乎其微，故政府尚未考慮具體之取締辦法，由各地方機關嚴予查緝可也。</p>
<h3>沖繩戰局現勢　日軍絕對有利　中立國人士觀察</h3>
<p>關於冲繩作戰，美方報道夙有樂觀口吻，所以瑞典京城常地人士亦以爲攻克冲繩僅係時間問題。唯近時美方消息已一反其故態，尤其是尼米資公報，更口口聲聲說冲繩戰綫各處均有「激烈戰鬥」，而軍事專家方面對於冲繩戰事，也從新的觀點加以批評。據瑞典京城某軍事專家稱，最近日方特攻隊的反擊極有效果，美國因此喪失多數艦船，以致補給極爲困難，此一事實已難隱飾，並稱未來十日間的戰事極爲重要，對於太平洋整個戰局有極大的影饗，因而承認冲繩戰事實具有決戰的性質·</p>
<p>更可注目的，便是蘇聯亦打破畏時期的沈默，突於四月十八日在紅星報發表一篇題爲「太平洋戰爭」的論文（作者爲烏艾里雅勃丘克海軍少佐），該文力稱冲繩戰事極爲重要，足以決定日美戰局的將來。此點表明蘇聯如何關懷該島一帶的戰况。茲譯述其大意於後：</p>
<p>「登陸冲繩本島的美軍，迄四月一日止，已進抵該島東岸，圖截斷日軍，但最近日軍的抵抗顯已增大，美軍的推進因而遲鈍。迄至四月十二日止，美軍已佔領該島四分之一，迫近那覇，然日軍自奄美大島方面於黑夜用小型艦船派遣生力軍增援冲繩，並用空軍攻擊美軍艦艇。以是日美兩軍在該方面展開劇烈海空戰，雙方均受重大損害。又，英國太平洋艦隊亦已參加該處戰鬥。這次戰鬥，因係演出於日本海軍及基地空軍的作戰圈內，所以日方的地位遠比英美有利。美軍從塞班至此，距離在一千五百哩以上，而日方由九州至琉球，僅須數小時即得。因此，反軸心國方面，在戰鬥區域所能憑藉的空軍勢力，祗有艦上機以及已佔領的陸上飛行塲所有的空軍。要之，琉球方面的戰事，其歸趨如何，現在尙難斷定。不過，英美海空軍業已遭遇日本空軍及水上部隊的果敢抵抗，則很明顯。」（瑞典京城二十四日特電·譯自四月二十四日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>閒話南翔</h3>
<p>— 志澄</p>
<p>南翔地居京滬鐵路之北，位於上海市之西郊，爲嘉定縣重鎭之一。事變前，交通便利，運輸發達，商業繁盛，又以地價低廉，風景淸秀，滬上人士在此購地造屋者頗多。今則受砲火之威脅，瓦礫遍地，殘垣盈目，商業簫條，惟爲內地（太·崑·常·）米糧貨物運滬必經之要道，故市面得賴之雜持。現有人口三萬七千九百六十五人，以全鎮現有面積論，分佈尚各稠密。</p>
<h3>風景物價</h3>
<p>昔者古漪園及南園，乃南翔郊外之風景區。其中水木淸華，點綴頗勝，爲遊樂勝地，今已面目全非。均毀砲火之下。</p>
<p>出園回鎭，沿途米販子，來往不絕，或肩抗，或車載，道爲之塞。詢米價，謂近因供求不均，日漸上漲，今日（五月七日）在十一萬左右。面臨大街，兩旁商店櫛比，其中茶館二三，座客常滿，所談者無非生活艱難而已。一般物價，均較上海略高，蓋因鐵路運輸不便，所恃者僅公路，經重重關卡之剝削，販運者唯有將價格提高，方可獲利。按理，菜蔬應較便宜，事實上，在上市期內，當地產物儘量運滬，產地供需失其平衡，價格立即上漲，時或更高於滬上所售　，此亦畸形現象也。</p>
<h3>敎育現况</h3>
<p>鎭上中小學共十三所，人數不過一千六百餘人，在西北郊外，尙有上海靜安寺所辦之佛敎南翔鄕村小學，全校共一百餘人，均爲附近之村童。以全鎮學齡兒童論，失學者甚衆，據辦敎育者言，唯多設單級小學始可救濟之，但當局對現存學校，僅可勉强維持，安得再創新校。此唯有賴諸熱心敎育諸君，有以致之。學費以私校較貴；至敎員待遇，縣立學校，每月俸米三斗，尙有津貼二百元，以往來車資，遠在此數之上，故大都不願往縣府提取。私校教員，每月連米貼（不供膳宿）約合六萬元，小學四萬元。至師資方面，因待遇關係，普通教員僅初中師範畢業，若高中畢業者，已屬不可多得矣。</p>
<h3>人民負担</h3>
<p>鎮上居民，大都爲關此不能過活　中下階級，應付生活，困疲至極，蓋因捐稅名目　夥，如：公務員食米捐，警米捐，保甲經費捐，營業稅，所得稅，田賦，田租等等。尙有公家費用，亦須由各戶攤派，人民負擔之重，自可想而知，少數佃農，於農忙期後，均賴走私爲生，但途巾勒索，事所難免。情之可憐，言之不盡。</p>
<h3>市况交通</h3>
<p>時當立夏佳節，往年鎮上，採　各貨，市面興隆，今年則遠不如昔，南貨店前，門可羅雀，　論其他各店，於此可反映農村經濟之敝疲，與人民購買力之薄弱。</p>
<p>本地田畝，向爲「棉七稻三」，但因近年來，米糧價格遠高於棉花　，一般農民，遂將棉田改植稻穀，以圖厚利，致成「稻七棉三」之象。當局有鑒於斯，特會同華中棉產改進會，鼓勵鄕民種植陸地金字棉，協力增產，以挽頹勢，藉合戰事需要。</p>
<p>在市梢頭公路旁，除汽車，人力車外，最近更多一種工見，即米販以運米之自由車，用以載單身旅客，直達各地，其價較人力車廉，且行駛較速，此亦應時品之一也。</p>
<h3>重慶強化　物價管理</h3>
<p>中央社訊據重慶廣播：最近蔣介石下令重慶市政府，着即日强化物價管理。據息，渝市府奉命後，已擬定管理辦法八項，對於一般物價評定公定價格，商人不得隨意抬價。</p>

<h3>美蘇進行　借款談判</h3>
<p>里期本十六日中央社電　據華盛頓電：關於美國向蘇聯短期貸款之支付方法，美蘇間交涉曾一旦陷於停頓狀態，但傳最近又有進行交涉之可能。該項短期借款，係充蘇聯國內復興之用，蘇聯方面需額若干尙未知悉，但希望之總數約在數十億美元</p>
<h3>澳代表發言抨擊　美洲地域主義　舊金山會議再起風波</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電據舊金山電：澳洲外長愛華特十四日首先攻擊美洲主義後，復發表聲明，暴露美國對中南美代表之陰謀，使舊金山會議再起風波。該聲明略稱，中央安全保障理事會之權　倘不能維持，則美洲主義將採取一種孤立形式誕生，不久將產生之新國際機構必告崩潰，美洲安全保障體制，僅爲美國獨自所計劃，意欲將美洲置於私囊而已。美國之意圖，不外欲以安全保障理事會常務理事國資格，發揮獨裁的　力，使美洲地域脫離國際機構，任其所爲。美國欲使美洲地城主義，脫離國際機構，再三要求中南美各國放棄安全保障理事會理事由十一名增爲十五名之建議，如此國際機構前途不堪設想云。美國主張之地域主義，突遭澳洲正面反對，使美國代表陷於進退兩難之境。</p>
<h3>美提新建議獲三國同意</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　據美方公報：美國務卿斯蒂丁紐斯昨提出建議云，我等急需擬定一「國際自由權利憲章」之草案，蓋該項憲章實為新國際機構中所不可缺少之第一步重要工作。同時斯蒂丁紐斯向記者團發表意見稱，渠深信此新國際機構中之經濟及社會建設委員會，應建立一言諭自由·宗敎自由·不缺乏物資·脫離威脅之一定標準·渠復稱，能使人類自由權利之發揮，實爲此次大會中最重要之工作項目。</p>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　據舊金山電：美國對於「地方安全保障機構」應授予不受世界安全保障機構所管束之自由獨立權，以處置目前各敵性國家之建議，已獲蘇英渝三國之同意而簽訂成立，然拉丁美洲各國似不能接受該項修正建議，蓋彼等欲爲全美合衆國獲一更大之自治權。</p>
<h3>三巨頭會議將在歐舉行</h3>

<h3>莫洛托夫　返抵莫斯科</h3>

<p>里斯本十五日中央社電舊金山來電：蘇聯十四日提議以捷克斯洛伐克之首都普拉格爲新國際機構所在地。按捷克前與蘇聯締結安全保障條約後，事實上已在蘇聯勢力範圍內。</p>
<h3>柏林地下　秘密建築</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社　電據莫斯科傳來公報稱，路透社特派訪員談述柏林城之情形如下：研究柏林「地下城」之蘇軍，現已發現深遂之地道。通　。地下室。製造廠。供應所等地下建築。大部份柏林居民，對於此項地窟之存在，亦如外界人之隔膜。蓋此項地下建築，普被德政府或各區主管當局嚴密看守，禁止外人入內，甚至站於進口處之看守軍，亦僅知近旁之門戶，一般入內之官員，亦僅知彼等所居之一部份而已。此外蘇軍復發現戈林上將及郭培爾之特別避彈室，戈林之避彈室中，裝有鋼鐵製成之堅壁，任何彈片不能穿入。郭培爾之避彈室深計六十公尺，彼之家人及親信部屬均居於該室。同時室內裝有一精緻之擴音機，能使彼於地室中向前綫軍人廣播「永久抗戰」之最後演詞。最精密之地下建築，厥為格斯達堡司令部之附近處，蘇軍曾於該處裝有鐵壁之某室中，搜出大量槍械子彈等火器。</p>
<h3>漢堡市　漸復舊觀</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電據漢堡路透社專員稱：依照美國所定之計劃，德國最火港口漢堡予以交通發展，使其成爲德國戰後第一大都市，並爲首都及集散地，該城擬改稱丹離士馬丁。在管理與組織兩方面，漢堡將為英國佔領區之最要部份，市內各銀行昨日開始復業，英國軍官數名將德國社黨海陸空軍三部暨各官吏直接或間接所有存款予以凍結，保險公司亦開始復業。雖城中多處地方異常毀壞，然城中秩序已上正軌，街頭民衆擁擠，各人希望電車在數日內可以照常行駛，市內糧食仍受統制，漢堡戰前市長克羅門，在英軍佔領後仍在該城守職。</p>
<h3>搜索戰爭罪犯　封鎖德國境　戈林名列黑單</h3>
<p>蘇黎世十六日中央社電　據十五日晚盧森堡廣播：德佔領軍爲防止戰爭罪犯及其他搜査中之人物逃亡，於十五日封鎖德國國境。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　據丹京傳來消息：哥本哈根之某報於週四發出斷言，略謂，「希姆來正於渠數百名德親衛隊保護之下」，然該報並未聲明爲何英國當局似無逮捕希氏之意。</p>
<h3>捷克樹立　自治政府</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電據普拉格廣播：捷克斯拉夫新首相維爾林格爾十三日曾發表：捷克斯拉夫之喀爾巴阡烏克蘭地方，業已樹立一自治政府，並承認捷克斯拉夫政府之權威，據傳目下該政府希望併入蘇維埃聯邦。</p>
<h3>蘇准波軍參加　佔領德土</h3>

<h3>英美俘虜　獲得解放　用飛機載運離德</h3>

<h3>爲小學敎師請命</h3>
<p>近來物價跳動，使一般　水階級大起恐慌，尤其是清苦的小學教師，他們白天教書，晚上改卷，終日碌硃，刻無暇　，旣不能利用業務上的便利，以謀額外收入，又無資金可供運用。表面上這學期學校當局，增加學費，是為提高教師待遇，實際上目前月支萬元薪水而不供膳食的，　是到處可見。雖然教育局為體恤教師起見，曾有特配米的補助，但不知何故，此項配給，既不能如期分發，又不　預定每月三斗之數，即使完全領到，充其量也僅能維持個人生活而已！至於仰事俯　，更是談何容易！</p>
<p>據筆者所知，小學敎師的子女遭受失學痛苦的，　　不可　計！上月初。同里中有個小學敎師的女兒，竟因果腹無計，活活的餓死。像這種　　情狀，若非目覩，幾　置　；可是他們並不因此灰心，他們很明白自身的地位，和責任的重大，平時不但能忍苦耐勞的為下一代認眞服務，而且　從百忙中抽出時間來進修。</p>
<p>我們對於這般負有神聖使命的小學敎師的艱苦遭遇，決不能袖手旁觀，無動於中。須知他們雖有卓越的精神，可是終究是血肉之軀，那堪多少磨折！如果影響健康，或竟因此犧牲。都是社會的損失，雖無子婦？誰不欲子女受教育於良師？為了　已的子女，也爲了未來的社會，筆者萬分誠意地盼望社會熱心人士，本人類互助之義，對於這一　忠心於教育事業的小學教師，迅作有效的援助－（岩）</p>

<h3>Taking the Same Measures as Allied Nations: Foreign Ministry Issues Statement Yesterday; International Anti-Comintern Pact Participation Invalidated</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Following Allied nation Japan's statement on the 15th that treaties with Germany and other European countries had become invalid, and the simultaneous abolishment of the Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact, the Foreign Ministry of our National Government, taking the same measures as Japan, declared its previously announced participation in the International Anti-Comintern Pact invalid, effective immediately. The Foreign Ministry's statement is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the International Anti-Comintern Pact of November 25, 1936, and its supplementary protocols, which were formed by the protocols of November 6, 1937, and the protocols extending its validity in 1941, the Republic of China announced its accession on November 25, 1941. The original signatories to the pact, Germany and Italy, have now unconditionally surrendered to the anti-Axis forces, and the Italian government has been dissolved. The Japanese government has already declared the pact invalid, and the Third International has been dissolved. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry, representing the National Government of the Republic of China, in order to take the same measures as the Japanese government, hereby declares the aforementioned International Anti-Comintern Pact, to which it previously acceded, invalid from this date forward. This statement is issued on May 16, 1945.</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Water Attack Unit Launches Operations in Okinawa Seas; Sinks or Destroys 32 Enemy Ships</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Special Water Attack Unit, operating in the Okinawa area, has achieved the following cumulative results from March 28th to May 13th: Sunk one cruiser, six destroyers, two large transport ships, seven landing craft, and ten other ships; destroyed one landing craft (presumed sunk), one transport ship (believed sunk), one vessel resembling a minesweeper, two ships ablaze (unidentified), and one medium-sized transport ship.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 14th, Japanese air units continued their attacks on enemy ships near Okinawa, sinking one large transport ship and one destroyer, and confirmed 18 large fires at ground bases. Enemy central and northern airfields were also attacked by Japanese aircraft, with fires breaking out at four locations.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the night of the 15th, Japanese air units attacked enemy airfields on Okinawa Island, causing fires in several locations after hits. Enemy aircraft attacks on the Ryukyus numbered only about one hundred that day.</p>
<h3>American Aircraft Carrier Task Force Suffers Extremely Heavy Damage</h3>
<p>Southwest Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a British aviation lieutenant shot down and captured by Japanese forces in the Yaeyama Islands area, the British carrier task force departed from Ulithi Harbor in early May to relieve the American carrier task force in the southwestern island group area, which had been heavily damaged by intense Japanese attacks, in order to strengthen its forces. The prisoner stated that the American carrier task force suffered extremely severe damage, losing 45 percent of its carrier strength and 49 percent of its other ship strength. Therefore, the British voluntarily proposed the replacement. The British fleet force departing from Ishigaki Island reportedly included two special carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and twelve destroyers.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At 10:00 AM on May 10th, Japanese aircraft discovered a large enemy submarine surfaced in the Southwest Pacific and launched a large-scale attack. The enemy submarine was hit by two bombs, and oil slicks appeared on the surface of the sea, indicating it had sunk. At 5:00 PM on the 11th, two enemy submarines were discovered navigating. Japanese aircraft attacked the submarine in the lead, hitting the conning tower, and it soon sank.</p>
<h3>Fighting Intensifies in Southern Okinawa</h3>
<p>Tokyo, (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese forces on the Okinawa Island front are engaged in fierce fighting with enemy forces, who are attempting to break through Japanese lines north of Naha and Shuri. On the night of the 13th, numerous suicide squads charged into enemy lines in the Aza area north of Naha, throwing the enemy into a state of confusion. On the night of the 14th, a continuous and fierce offensive was launched against the entire enemy line, and the offensive continued unabated on the 15th, further intensifying the battle. Japanese forces in the eastern coastal area continue to secure their positions north of Yonagusuku, repeatedly repulsing attacks by the American 7th Division. Enemy forces have penetrated Japanese lines in several locations from the central highlands to the western coastal front. The enemy has penetrated from the heights north of Hirara-cho, a suburb north of Shuri, to the Uebaru area north of Yonagusuku, to the area north of Gushikawa, and from the Aza area to the Asato area northeast of Naha. In the area north of Naha, two battleships, two cruisers, and five destroyers approached the Naha coast, repeatedly attacking under the cover of naval bombardment. However, Japanese forces are securing their established positions, resolutely defending the Asato and northern Naha areas, and repelling the enemy's attempts, currently thwarting the enemy's plans. Since the enemy landed on the island at the beginning of April, the enemy force entering the southern area has reached as many as six divisions. Due to the brave fighting of Japanese forces, the 96th and 27th Divisions have lost their combat effectiveness and have retreated. Currently, the enemy's 1st Amphibious Corps, consisting of the 7th Division in the eastern coastal area, the 77th Division and the 1st Marine Division in the central highlands north of Shuri, and the 6th Marine Division, which has been transferred from the Nago Bay area to the north of Naha, a total of four divisions, have all suffered heavy casualties due to the brave and courageous fighting of the Japanese elite forces. Japanese units in the central part of the island are currently cooperating with local residents to continue their brave repulsion, putting the enemy in a difficult situation.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troop Casualties on Okinawa Island Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch - The battle situation in Okinawa has now reached a fierce stage where every inch of land is contested. The enemy in the southern part of the island seems to have launched a full-scale general offensive, but despite the enemy's abundance of supplies, the repeated sinking of warships and aircraft by Japanese forces has forced them to reveal their pessimistic mood. The Nimitz communique often publishes how minor their own losses are. According to U.S. Army spokesman Major H. Elivar, although Japanese aircraft attack daily, American facilities on the Okinawa Island coast have not suffered any major damage. The U.S. military's tactics are to cut off supply routes and hinder Japanese resupply, so the enemy claims that the battle of Okinawa is not being rushed to victory. Since the enemy invaded Okinawa, their ships have been repeatedly sunk and damaged, totaling 80% of their total strength. The enemy's boasted East Asia return voyages have now been eliminated by Japanese forces, resulting in major chaos in the enemy's convoys. U.S. Tenth Army Commander Lieutenant General Buckner cabled that he cannot expect much success, and the New York Times editorial also stated that the Pacific War has already entered a direction of slipping away, and the fighting there is too fierce, causing heartache to our people, and because the war is a chaotic battle, heavy sacrifices are inevitable. According to intelligence, when the battle of Okinawa began, the enemy's main forces were the 96th and 27th Divisions of the 25th Army Corps. These two divisions have been completely wiped out by Japanese forces, and the other four armies have also been badly battered. In their anxiety to make a final stand, they have launched this general offensive. Since the beginning of the battle of Okinawa, 3,967 American soldiers have died, but this number is not complete. According to U.S. Tenth Army Medical Officer Colonel Frederick H. Horstweiler's announcement this month, in the war in the central Pacific, personnel losses were roughly 6% to 8% dead. According to the enemy, in the American war in Europe, the military loss rate, including both dead and wounded, was only 2.8%, indicating the heavy losses suffered by the enemy in this invasion of Okinawa Island. Regarding the reason for such an alarming mortality rate, Colonel Horstweiler said that due to the lack of field hospitals on the various Pacific fronts, as of this month, more than 6,000 American soldiers wounded in the battle of Okinawa have been transported by aircraft to the rear. This plan to transport the wounded is the largest in scale in this war in terms of distance. According to the Colonel, the need for military hospitals is great in the European theater, so medical work in the Pacific is being neglected, with only field hospitals for garrison units. The Colonel hopes that a base hospital will be established in the Pacific now that the European war has ended. He also said that at the beginning of the Okinawa operation, American losses were very light, but today they have reached a high rate of 200 to 300 people per day, but hospital facilities remain the same. The Colonel kept secret the mortality rate of combat personnel wounded since the beginning of the Okinawa battle, but said that since the beginning of this operation, more than 2,000 soldiers from the army and more than 4,000 sailors have been transported by aircraft to the rear, so 10 aircraft are dispatched daily to carry wounded and sick soldiers, and it is expected that this will increase soon.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Observations on the Enemy American Political Future</h3>
<p>In terms of personal fate, Truman's succession to the presidency after Roosevelt is perhaps a piece of good luck, but in terms of the fate of American politics, it is truly the misfortune of American politics to have Truman as the wartime leader of the United States. This misfortune is caused by Article 60 of the American Constitution. Although American officials, congressmen, nationals, and frontline soldiers all know that this is a preordained "imperial robe addition" farce, they are helpless because of the provisions of the Constitution.</p>
<p>According to American political custom, the people avoid all criticism as much as possible during the first 100 days of a new president's term, so that the new head of state can embark on a normal track. Truman was naturally no exception at the beginning of his term, and because of the urgency of the world situation, in order to reduce the political impact after Roosevelt's sudden death, even the opposition party had to perfunctorily accept Truman's appointment. However, in fact, American citizens' political feelings had already been shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>Although President Truman's term has not yet reached 100 days, we can predict from the situation in the month since he took office that his political future will be rugged and not very optimistic. The first test he encountered in politics was the opening of the San Francisco Conference. The nature of the American people is exaggerated and self-superior. They have unlimited expectations for the San Francisco Conference, believing that they can convene representatives of dozens of countries on a part of their territory to discuss issues that dominate the world. Therefore, they have even greater hopes for the activities of their own head of state. However, unexpectedly, Roosevelt died suddenly, and Truman was just an "ordinary old man growing out of the darkness", unable to play the role of director on this world stage, which made the American people feel universally disappointed.</p>
<p>Therefore, Truman's political future faces both an international political crisis and a domestic political crisis. On the international political stage, the experienced Roosevelt still had to be deeply vigilant in front of Stalin and Churchill, and Truman was of course difficult to stand on an equal footing, let alone lead. In this San Francisco Conference, the weakness of the American attitude and the strong statements of Soviet representative Molotov both showed Truman's lack of prestige and lack of political skill.</p>
<p>In domestic politics, Truman's mediocre ability is even less sufficient to control the army and navy, direct diplomatic figures, or deal with members of various parties and factions in Congress. Roosevelt served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the First World War, while Truman was only an artillery captain at that time; Roosevelt was elected four times and served as president for 12 years, while Truman was only elected as a senator in 1934. His qualifications are far from comparable to Roosevelt's. Recently, the Republican Party in Congress launched a fierce attack on the tariff reduction bill left by Roosevelt, which is a reflection of Truman's lack of political power.</p>
<p>Truman was trusted by Roosevelt because he served as Chairman of the Senate Military Production Investigation Committee in 1935 and achieved some success in military production. In this way, Truman seems to be able to be confident in the mobilization of American national materials, but now the American people are considering the post-war economic recovery. If Truman continues to implement strengthening wartime economic institutions, he will inevitably be fiercely opposed by the business community.</p>
<p>Truman said when he took office that he would take Roosevelt's policies as his own, but just like driving a carriage, although it is the same route and the same horse, because of the different skills and abilities of the driver, it is often either stumbling due to rushing or failing to reach the original ideal due to slowness. Truman is an ordinary driver. I am afraid that he will not be able to adapt to the environment and control himself.</p>
<p>In recent years, American democratic politics has been trending towards dictatorial politics because Roosevelt has concentrated political power as much as possible. The more it is in the form of dictatorial politics, the more talented the political leader must be. Truman is certainly not a suitable candidate, and the political power of the United States will inevitably be dispersed and lose its balance of power. The American people are very emotional, and public opinion is quite noisy. In the near future, Truman will inevitably encounter harsh accusations and strong criticisms, so the misfortune of American politics will become even more profound. Due to the domestic political crisis, it is very likely to affect the changes in the war situation. In short, because of Truman's political poverty, the tragedy of American politics will inevitably be exposed to the world soon.</p>
<h3>Nagoya Air Raid: Three-Hundred-Year-Old Historical Site Bombed and Reduced to Ashes</h3>
<p>Nagoya, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Honmaru Palace and the five-story, seven-tiered main tower inlaid with golden dolphins, which embody the essence of Eastern architecture and classical splendor, were all historical sites with three hundred years of history. Unfortunately, they were reduced to ashes at 8:20 AM on the 14th of this month. At around 8:05 AM that morning, enemy aircraft dropped incendiary bombs, which were extinguished for a time. However, at 8:20 AM, a large enemy formation heavily bombed Nagoya. The Honmaru Palace, the main tower, the Otemon Gate, the Omote-nimon Gate, and the Kiyomasa Stone Gate, all known for their magnificence and luxury, were all reduced to ashes. The male and female golden dolphins, which had not been completely evacuated, also suffered fire damage. However, the national treasure paintings and artworks stored in the palace, except for the murals, were not looted because they had been moved elsewhere. The indiscriminate bombing of Nagoya Castle, which is known for its golden dolphins, is a barbaric artistic act by an enemy that boasts of culture but does not understand what culture is.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacked Southern Korean Waters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Seoul, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Korean Army Administration Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 16th that from 8:30 AM to 2:50 PM on the 16th, two enemy B-29 aircraft and six PBM aircraft, each in formations of two, attacked southern Korean waters from the sea west of Jeju Island and then gradually fled to the southwest.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, enemy PB M-3 Catalina patrol bombers have appeared in the Korean Strait and the sea west of Kyushu, either individually or in pairs, aiming to disrupt Japanese transportation lines. At around 10:00 AM on the 15th, two invaded the sea west of Nagasaki Prefecture and blindly attacked ships, etc. After being discovered by Japanese air defense forces, one was immediately shot down near Ukujima Island. The other was hit and attempted to escape, but was also shot down.</p>
<h3>Damage in Taichung is Currently Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Taipei, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 15th, approximately 90 enemy bombers, taking off from bases in the Philippines, attacked the Hsinchu area. A part of them attacked the Taichung area, and after 2:00 PM, they retreated south. Also, two B-23 aircraft invaded Taipei City that morning. The extent of the damage is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Suicide Squads Active in the Tarakan Airfield Area</h3>
<p>Southwest Frontline Base, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy forces on Tarakan Island have subsequently attempted to attack the airfield area and the area around the Jojoike-Ikedadai area, conducting reconnaissance with small-scale forces. Japanese forces have inflicted heavy blows on them in front of the lines. Furthermore, suicide squads have launched night attacks to disrupt the enemy's efforts to reinforce their positions and mount an offensive. Due to the fierce attacks by Japanese forces, the enemy's losses have increased. Since the 11th, the battle lines have been deadlocked. The use of the airfield is out of the question, and even the oil field construction is impossible. Especially in the airfield area, Japanese suicide squads have engaged in desperate activity. On the night of the 13th, numerous suicide squads also launched attacks, killing or wounding more than 142 enemy soldiers and destroying and burning many of their barracks and supply depots. To guard against attacks by Japanese suicide squads, the enemy has hung alarm bells around their positions and campsites, lit them up brightly, and taken strict precautions.</p>
<h3>American Japanese Are Frequently Targeted by Snipers</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, as the fighting on the Pacific Front has intensified, antipathy towards American Japanese in various places along the Pacific coast has also increased. According to a statement released by the Washington Wartime Forced Relocation Bureau on the 14th, in the past four months, there have been two assassinations, fifteen sniper attacks, six attempted bombings, three arson cases, and five forced encounters in California. To cite more specific examples, it is reported that in California, thugs fired two shots at Mrs. Sekisaka Motosetsuko, an elderly woman of 61 years old, with a pistol. One bullet grazed the old woman's head and hit the wall. Also, in Tarbant, in that state, a group of thugs attacked a woman named Masuda.</p>
<h3>Southern Youths Receive Military Education</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Nineteen youths from Indonesia (thirteen from Java, four from Sumatra, and one each from Malaya and Borneo), four youths from the Philippines, and two from Burma, aspiring to shoulder the important task of defending their countries and determined to receive military education, entered the Japanese Army Academy on the 15th to study.</p>
<h3>Chief Secretary Xu Wen Assumes Office the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Xu Tianshen, the newly appointed Chief Secretary of the National Government, held an inauguration ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 10:00 AM on the 15th. First, Lin Wenhai, Director of the Bureau of Documents, delivered a speech on behalf of the former Chief Secretary Zhou, followed by a speech by Chief Secretary Xu, full of encouragement.

<h3>Enemy Ships Sunk in Davao Bay</h3>

<h3>Associated Reserve Bank Issues New Hundred Yuan Notes</h3>
<p>Beijing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Bank of China Joint Reserve Bank issued new hundred-yuan notes on May 16th. The front side is orange-red and printed with a brown image of the Yellow Emperor. The reverse side is printed with images of the Summer Palace and other scenes.</p>
<h3>Municipal Canteens to be Established Throughout Beijing</h3>
<p>Beijing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Due to rising prices and the increasing difficulty of people's lives, especially for general civil servants, the Chinese and Japanese authorities in this city have decided to select suitable locations in many places to open municipal canteens, specifically for Chinese and Japanese civil servants to eat. The prices will be set at particularly low levels to help stabilize the lives of civil servants.</p>
<h3>Finance Ministry Official Explains Current Financial Policies: Gradual Success in Stabilizing Finance</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Finance Ministry official met with a group of Chinese and foreign reporters in the capital at 3:00 PM on the 16th and provided a concise explanation of the current financial policies of the National Government. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<h3>Improving the Treatment of Civil Servants</h3>
<p>(Question) Given that the cost of living is currently high, has the government considered improving the treatment of central civil servants? (Answer) The government has always been concerned about the issue of civil servant treatment, but it is limited by the overall financial budget of the National Government and cannot be compared with general commodity prices. However, within the possible scope, we are determined to seek improvement. Starting in the second half of the year, the wartime allowance will be considered for further increase to help stabilize living standards. Detailed measures are currently being formulated.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Subscription to Gold Certificates</h3>
<p>(Question) What is the impact of the issuance of gold certificates on the National Government's finances? (Answer) The purpose of issuing gold certificates is to contract the currency supply and stabilize finance. After the first phase was issued, due to sufficient reserves, subscribers were unusually enthusiastic, exceeding the expected number and withdrawing more than 100 million in currency. The results were very good. The second phase is also being prepared for issuance, which will be of great benefit to the National Government's policies to stabilize finance. (Question) How have the results been since the wartime special consumption tax was changed to be collected by local governments in each province and city starting in January of this year? (Answer) The general results after the special consumption tax was collected by local governments have been good, but because this tax is very trivial and complicated, there are many discrepancies in the amounts submitted to the central government from various places.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Salt Transportation and Sales</h3>
<p>(Question) What is the current situation regarding salt transportation? (Answer) The current lack of smoothness in salt production and sales is not due to a reduction in production, but purely due to transportation difficulties. On the contrary, production is actually higher than before the shift. Because traffic cannot be smooth during wartime, transportation and sales cannot be smooth. The Salt Administration is currently actively consulting with all relevant parties on transportation issues and striving to improve the situation.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Rate Between the Two Currencies Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Question) Recently, there have been many rumors about the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes, causing black market prices to rise significantly. What are your thoughts on this issue? (Answer) Under the current circumstances, the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes will definitely not change. The rise in the black market is purely due to the actions of speculators.</p>
<h3>Preventing the Influx of Customs Gold Units</h3>
<p>(Question) Customs Gold Units from the Chongqing side have recently been flowing into the "peaceful" areas. This will undoubtedly affect the financial situation of the government. Has the Ministry of Finance considered measures to curb this? The Ministry has also repeatedly heard about the influx into "peaceful" areas, mostly carried by individual peddlers, with the sole purpose of taking advantage of price differences in various regions to make a small profit, not deliberately disrupting the financial system. Furthermore, the amount flowing in is negligible, so the government has not yet considered specific measures to prohibit it. Strict inspections by local authorities should suffice.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of the Battle of Okinawa: Japanese Army Holds Absolute Advantage, According to Neutral Observers</h3>
<p>Regarding the Okinawa operation, American reports have always been optimistic, so people in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, also believed that conquering Okinawa was only a matter of time. However, recently, the American news has reversed its previous attitude. In particular, the Nimitz communiqué repeatedly stated that "fierce battles" were taking place in all parts of the Okinawa front. Military experts are also criticizing the Okinawa war from new perspectives. According to a military expert in Stockholm, the recent counterattacks by the Japanese special attack forces have been very effective, causing the United States to lose a large number of ships, making resupply extremely difficult. This fact is difficult to conceal. He also stated that the battles in the next ten days will be extremely important and will have a great impact on the entire Pacific war situation, thus acknowledging that the Okinawa war is indeed a decisive battle.</p>
<p>What is even more noteworthy is that the Soviet Union has also broken its silence of the past and suddenly published an article entitled "The Pacific War" in the Red Star newspaper on April 18 (written by Navy Major U. A. Liabchuk). The article strongly stated that the Okinawa war is extremely important and will determine the future of the Japanese-American war situation. This indicates how concerned the Soviet Union is about the war situation in the area. An abridged translation of the main points is as follows:</p>
<p>"The American troops who landed on the main island of Okinawa had advanced to the east coast of the island by April 1, attempting to cut off the Japanese army. However, the recent resistance of the Japanese army has obviously increased, and the American advance has therefore slowed down. As of April 12, the American army had occupied a quarter of the island and was approaching Naha. However, the Japanese army dispatched reinforcements to Okinawa from the Amami Oshima area at night using small ships, and used the air force to attack American warships. As a result, fierce naval and air battles have broken out in this area between the Japanese and American forces, with both sides suffering heavy losses. In addition, the British Pacific Fleet has also joined the battle there. Because this battle is taking place within the operational zone of the Japanese Navy and base air force, the Japanese side has a far more advantageous position than the British and Americans. The distance from Saipan to Okinawa for the American army is more than 1,500 miles, while the Japanese side only needs a few hours from Kyushu to the Ryukyus. Therefore, the air power that the anti-Axis powers can rely on in the battle area is only the aircraft on ships and the air force from the land airfields that have already been occupied. In short, it is still difficult to determine the outcome of the war in the Ryukyus. However, it is clear that the British and American naval and air forces have encountered the courageous resistance of the Japanese air force and naval forces."

<h3>Random Notes on Nanxiang</h3>
<p>— Zhi Cheng</p>
<p>Nanxiang is located north of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, in the western suburbs of Shanghai, and is one of the important towns in Jiading County. Before the incident, transportation was convenient, shipping was developed, and commerce was prosperous. Moreover, because land prices were low and the scenery was beautiful, many people from Shanghai bought land and built houses here. Today, it is threatened by artillery fire, rubble is everywhere, ruined walls fill the eyes, and commerce is depressed. However, it is a necessary route for transporting rice and grain from the inland (Tai, Kun, Chang, etc.) to Shanghai, so the market depends on it for support. Currently, there is a population of 37,965 people, which is still relatively dense given the town's current area.</p>
<h3>Scenery and Prices</h3>
<p>In the past, Guyi Garden and Nanyuan were scenic areas in the suburbs of Nanxiang. The clear waters and lush trees inside were more than enough to decorate the area, making it a popular place for recreation. Now, it has been completely changed, all destroyed by artillery fire.</p>
<p>Returning to the town from the garden, rice vendors can be seen coming and going along the way, either carrying it on their shoulders or transporting it in carts, clogging the road. Asking about the price of rice, they say that it has been rising gradually recently due to the imbalance between supply and demand. Today (May 7), it is around 110,000. Facing the main street, shops are lined up side by side, with two or three teahouses among them, always full of customers, talking about nothing but the hardships of life. General prices are slightly higher than in Shanghai, probably because railway transportation is inconvenient, and they rely only on highways. After being exploited by multiple checkpoints, vendors can only raise prices to make a profit. Logically, vegetables should be cheaper, but in fact, during the market season, local produce is transported to Shanghai as much as possible, causing an imbalance in the supply and demand in the place of origin, and the price immediately rises, sometimes even higher than what is sold in Shanghai. This is also an abnormal phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Current State of Education</h3>
<p>There are a total of thirteen primary and secondary schools in the town, with just over 1,600 students. In the northwestern suburbs, there is also the Nanxiang Rural Primary School, run by Jing'an Temple in Shanghai, with a total of over 100 students, all of whom are village children from the vicinity. Considering the number of school-age children in the town, many are out of school. According to educators, setting up more single-grade primary schools is the only way to remedy the situation, but the authorities can only barely maintain the existing schools. How can they create new schools? This can only rely on enthusiastic educators to find a way. Tuition fees are more expensive in private schools. As for teachers' salaries, county schools provide three dou of rice per month, plus a subsidy of 200 yuan. The travel expenses are far above this amount, so most teachers are unwilling to go to the county government to collect it. Private school teachers receive about 60,000 yuan per month including rice subsidy (excluding board and lodging), and primary school teachers receive 40,000 yuan. As for the teaching staff, due to salary issues, ordinary teachers are only junior high school normal school graduates. If they are high school graduates, they are already rare.</p>
<h3>Burden on the People</h3>
<p>Most of the residents in the town are middle and lower classes who can barely make a living. They are extremely tired from coping with life because there are so many taxes and levies, such as: civil servants' rice donation, police rice donation, baojia expenses donation, business tax, income tax, field tax, field rent, and so on. There are also public expenses that must be shared by each household. The heavy burden on the people can be imagined. A small number of tenant farmers rely on smuggling for a living after the busy farming season, but extortion along the way is inevitable. The pitiful situation is beyond words.</p>
<h3>Market Conditions and Transportation</h3>
<p>It is now the Lesser Bountiful Festival. In previous years, the town was bustling with activity, purchasing various goods. This year, it is far from what it used to be. In front of the local goods stores, there is a lack of customers. Let alone other stores. This reflects the exhaustion of the rural economy and the weakness of the people's purchasing power.</p>
<p>The local fields used to be "70% cotton, 30% rice," but in recent years, the price of rice has been much higher than that of cotton. Therefore, most farmers have converted cotton fields to grow rice in order to make a large profit, resulting in a situation of "70% rice, 30% cotton." The authorities, aware of this, have joined forces with the China Central Cotton Improvement Association to encourage villagers to plant upland American cotton and work together to increase production in order to reverse the downward trend and meet the needs of the war.</p>
<p>Next to the highway at the edge of the market, in addition to cars and rickshaws, there is recently another type of vehicle: rice vendors using their rice-hauling tricycles to carry individual passengers directly to various places. The price is cheaper than rickshaws, and the speed is faster. This is also a product of the times.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Strengthens Price Controls</h3>
<p>According to a Chongqing broadcast by the Central News Agency: Recently, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Chongqing Municipal Government to strengthen price controls immediately. It is reported that the Chongqing Municipal Government, after receiving the order, has formulated eight management measures to set official prices for general commodities, and merchants are not allowed to raise prices arbitrarily.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Oshima and Others Detained by U.S. Forces</h3>
<p>Zurich, 16th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from Paris stated that the U.S. Seventh Army Headquarters announced on the 15th that Lieutenant General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, and a group of 130 people are currently being detained by the U.S. Seventh Army and protected as a diplomatic corps.</p>
<h3>U.S. and Soviet Union Conduct Loan Negotiations</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington: Negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the payment methods for short-term loans to the Soviet Union had once stalled, but it is rumored that there may be a possibility of further negotiations recently. This short-term loan is intended for the Soviet Union's domestic reconstruction. The amount required by the Soviet side is still unknown, but the total amount hoped for is approximately several billion U.S. dollars.</p>
<h3>Australian Representative Attacks American Regionalism: Another Storm at the San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco: After first attacking American regionalism on the 14th, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt issued a statement exposing the American conspiracy against representatives from Central and South America, causing another storm at the San Francisco Conference. The statement stated that if the authority of the Central Security Council cannot be maintained, Americanism will emerge in an isolated form. The new international organization that will soon be created is bound to collapse. The American Security Protection System is merely planned by the United States alone, intending to place the Americas in its own pocket. The intention of the United States is none other than to use its qualifications as a permanent member of the Security Council to exert dictatorial power, allowing the American region to secede from international organizations and do as it pleases. The United States wants to separate American regionalism from international organizations and has repeatedly demanded that Central and South American countries abandon the proposal to increase the number of Security Council members from eleven to fifteen. If this is the case, the future of the international organization is unimaginable. The American advocacy of regionalism has been met with direct opposition from Australia, putting the American representatives in a dilemma.</p>
<h3>New American Proposal Gains Agreement from Three Nations</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to an American communiqué: U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius proposed yesterday, "We urgently need to draft a 'Charter of International Freedoms,' as this charter is an indispensable first step for the new international organization." At the same time, Stettinius told a group of reporters that he firmly believes that the Economic and Social Council in this new international organization should establish a certain standard of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. He added that enabling the realization of human rights is the most important item on the agenda of this conference.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco: The American proposal to grant "local security organizations" the free and independent right to deal with current enemy countries without being governed by the World Security Organization has been agreed upon and signed into effect by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Chongqing. However, the Latin American countries do not seem to accept this amendment, as they want the United States of America to obtain greater autonomy.</p>
<h3>Summit of Three Powers to Be Held in Europe</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to the most reliable sources in Washington: British Prime Minister Churchill, U.S. President Truman, and Marshal Stalin will hold a preliminary meeting. It is widely believed that this meeting will be held in Europe, but it is still doubtful whether Stalin will be able to leave the Soviet Union to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Molotov Returns to Moscow</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - Moscow broadcasted on the 14th that Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in Moscow on the 14th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from San Francisco: The Soviet Union proposed on the 14th that Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, be the location of the new international organization. It should be noted that after Czechoslovakia signed a security guarantee treaty with the Soviet Union, it has effectively been within the Soviet sphere of influence.</p>
<h3>Secret Underground Structures in Berlin</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - A public statement from Moscow relayed by Reuters special correspondent described the situation in Berlin: Soviet forces examining Berlin's "underground city" have discovered deep tunnels, passages, basements, factories, supply depots, and other underground structures. Most Berlin residents were as unaware of the existence of these underground structures as outsiders. These underground structures were closely guarded by the German government or local authorities, and foreigners were prohibited from entering. Even the guards stationed at the entrances only knew about the nearby doorways, and officials who entered only knew about the parts they occupied. In addition, Soviet forces discovered the special bomb shelters of General Goering and Goebbels. Goering's shelter was equipped with steel walls that no shrapnel could penetrate. Goebbels' shelter was 60 meters deep and housed his family and close subordinates. It also contained a sophisticated amplifier that allowed him to broadcast his final speech of "perpetual resistance" to soldiers on the front lines from the underground shelter. The most elaborate underground structure was located near the Gestapo headquarters, where Soviet forces found a large number of firearms and ammunition in a steel-walled room.</p>
<h3>Hamburg Gradually Restores Its Former Appearance</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters correspondent in Hamburg: Following the plan set by the United States, Hamburg, Germany's most important port, will be developed in terms of transportation to become Germany's largest post-war city and a capital and distribution center. The city is planned to be renamed Dan Lee Shi Martin. In terms of management and organization, Hamburg will be the most important part of the British occupation zone. The city's banks began to reopen yesterday. Several British officers froze the deposits of the German Social Democratic Party, the three branches of the armed forces, and various officials, directly or indirectly. Insurance companies also began to reopen. Although many parts of the city are severely damaged, order in the city has returned to normal. Crowds throng the streets, each hoping that the trams can resume normal service in a few days. Food in the city is still controlled. Hamburg's pre-war mayor, Croment, remained in office after the British occupation.</p>
<h3>Search for War Criminals: Borders of Germany Blocked, Goering Listed on Blacklist</h3>
<p>Zurich, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to Luxembourg radio on the evening of the 15th: To prevent war criminals and other individuals under investigation from escaping, the German occupation forces closed the borders of Germany on the 15th.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to news from London: The United Nations War Crimes Commission issued a proclamation yesterday stating: "Goering's name was already on the first list of accused war criminals in November 1944." At the same time, the commission considered Himmler responsible for the massacre of Jews.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Copenhagen relayed from Denmark: A Copenhagen newspaper asserted on Thursday that "Himmler is currently under the protection of several hundred of his German SS troops," but the newspaper did not state why the British authorities seemed to have no intention of arresting him.</p>
<h3>Czech Republic Establishes Autonomous Government</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a broadcast from Prague: Czechoslovakian Prime Minister Villingger announced on the 13th that the Carpathian Ukraine region of Czechoslovakia had established an autonomous government and recognized the authority of the Czechoslovakian government. It is rumored that the government currently hopes to join the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Allows Polish Army to Participate in the Occupation of German Territory</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Warsaw regime previously requested Poland to participate in the occupation of Germany. According to a dispatch from Moscow, regardless of whether Britain and the United States recognize it, the intention to share German occupation land is insisted upon. On the 14th, it was decided to send 1,000 Polish troops to Frankfurt-Wort.</p>
<h3>British and American Prisoners of War Liberated: Transported Away from Germany by Plane</h3>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Finance Adjusts Various Special Taxes: Summer Business Tax to Be Levied After Assessment</h3>
<p>In order to rectify the tax system and enrich the municipal treasury, the Municipal Bureau of Finance has thoroughly adjusted various special taxes and is actively engaged in the work that needs to be done. It is reported that the special tax departments of the Bureau include five types: bamboo and wood, livestock, paper, cured meat, and peppermint. The tax rate is uniformly 5%. Bamboo and wood and livestock are handled by the specially established collection offices and sub-collection offices below. Paper, cured meat, and peppermint are handled by the respective trade associations. It is also reported that the Bureau plans to levy the summer business tax for various industries in the city after the initial and re-assessment of the spring business tax is completed, based on the assessed amount (i.e., January, February, and March of this year), separately levying the business tax for the months of April, May, and June.</p>
<h3>Financial Institutions Tighten Remittances to the Interior: Assist Authorities in Relieving Cash Shortages</h3>
<p>Recently, the amount of cash in circulation in the city has been quite insufficient. The Central Reserve Bank, in order to coordinate the fellow banks' positions, provides as much cash as possible for withdrawal. Among them, some unscrupulous banks hold onto the cash and charge premiums. The general public suffers premium losses when they need cash. The Central Reserve Bank is aware of this and, in order to eliminate premium flow and stabilize finance, has ordered strict inspections to crack down on it. It is also reported that various financial institutions in the city are implementing tighter remittance operations to the interior in order to help relieve the cash shortage, refusing to accept unnecessary remittances from merchants to the interior. The Central Reserve Bank has also imposed restrictions on the amount of Central Reserve Notes that merchants remit to various regions, in order to reduce the inflow of cash into the interior.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Gold Certificates Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>The first phase of the gold certificates issued by the Central Reserve Bank was issued on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of this month, and the results were very good. All the stubs of the issued quantity and the amount of gold in the reserve fund have been handed over to the Gold Certificate Issuance Reserve Fund Management Committee for safekeeping, in preparation for redemption at maturity. It is now learned that the second phase of gold certificates was originally scheduled to be issued from the 17th to the 19th. Due to the inability to expedite the procedures, it has been temporarily decided to postpone the issuance for a few days.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Personnel Promotions Under Strict Review</h3>
<p>The Commissioner and concurrently Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to encourage outstanding police officers, has issued a method for promotions, ordering various divisions, teams, stations, and sub-bureaus to select and report individuals with outstanding performance. It is now learned that the outstanding personnel for promotion have been reported by various units and are under strict review by the First Division of the General Bureau. Once the review is completed, opinions will be submitted, and the Director will then assess and decide. The rank promotions will then be formally appointed, and the announcement will be made publicly.</p>
<h3>Shipping Administration Bureau Establishes Western Zhejiang Branch</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Special Shipping Administration Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission has established branches in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Taihu Lake, and has now established a Western Zhejiang Branch in Jiaxing to manage the shipping transport in the Western Zhejiang area, including Jiashan, Pinghu, Haiyan, Hangxian, Yuhang, Wukang, Deqing, Tongxiang, and Chongde counties. Liu Guangzong has been appointed as the branch director, and it is planned to establish offices in the aforementioned counties to facilitate the advancement of work.</p>

Due to the extraordinary times, no ceremony will be held. Reporters from various newspapers are specially invited to attend and visit. It is also learned that the cars are equipped with safety equipment and dispatched personnel to provide services to ensure passenger safety during the journey.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Supply Gradually Smoothed After the Lifting of the Blockade</h3>
<p>For years, most of the city's food supply has come from the areas along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, with the supply determined by the smoothness of transportation and the changes in the local management structures and supervision methods. Recently, the blockade organizations in various counties and districts of the city have been ordered to be completely dismantled, and all inspection work will be stopped starting from the day of the announcement. Therefore, the transport of food rice to Shanghai has gradually become smoother, and the supply seems to be increasing daily. According to sources in the rice industry yesterday, the daily arrival of rice has increased by about two-fifths compared to the past. At the same time, citizens are also not stocking up excessively and have stopped large-scale hoarding, so the supply and demand are relatively balanced. It is expected that the city's food supply can be maintained stably for a long time.</p>
<h3>Change to Service Fees for the Materials Movement Office</h3>
<p>Starting from the 16th, the Materials Movement Permit Office of the Business Statistics Council has changed its method of collecting service fees. Amounts of 100 yuan or less outside of the face value of the invoice can be paid in cash. Amounts between 5 yuan and 10 yuan will be calculated as 10 yuan, and amounts below 5 yuan will be calculated as 5 yuan, in order to standardize the collection and payment process.</p>
<h3>Small Newspaper Federation: Executive Reporting Officer, Department Head Matsudaira, Attends and Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Small Newspaper Federation held a reception yesterday at the Kangle Restaurant to welcome the Allied Japanese Reporting Officer and the newly appointed Propaganda Director Gu Senqian. In attendance were Director Gu, Department Head of Intelligence Matsudaira, Reporting Department Head Matsushima, former Propaganda Director Liu Dexuan, and dozens of others. Chairman Wang Xue delivered the welcoming address, stating: "This is the first time that small newspapers have made such large-scale contact with the Chinese and Japanese authorities. In the past, small newspapers contributed little to society and the nation. Fellow professionals also acted independently, lacking unity. Now, propelled by the great era, the Small Newspaper Federation has been established, shouldering the responsibility of promoting culture together. We firmly believe that in the future, through common unity and effort, small newspapers will contribute their utmost to various cultural undertakings, welfare work, and cooperation in the Greater East Asia War for the nation and society."</p>
<h3>Matsudaira's Speech</h3>
<p>Department Head Matsudaira then delivered a speech, stating: "Small newspapers already have a certain history. In the future, by uniting and exerting their strength, they will definitely make significant contributions to the promotion of national and social culture, as well as the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Small newspapers are important for cultural work done through side channels. However, cultural work through side channels is also important at present. There are many ways to propagate information, but newspapers have the greatest power and effect. Therefore, newspapers bear a significant mission. This time, under the guidance of former Propaganda Director Liu, the Small Newspaper Federation was established. We would like to express our deep respect to Mr. Liu. At the same time, we deeply appreciate the efforts of the leaders of the small newspapers who have prepared and established a sound organization. In the future, we will do our best to unite and work diligently in our respective positions, and we wish the Small Newspaper Federation a glorious future." After the speech, the guests and hosts toasted each other, and the atmosphere was extremely harmonious.</p>
<h3>Director Xu Inspects Sewage Sludge Refining Plant</h3>

<h3>Fire on Yuyao Road: Generous Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The unprecedented fire on Yuyao Road in western Shanghai has left thousands of people homeless. This department has begun to collect donations to provide relief to the disaster area, which has aroused widespread sympathy throughout the city. Donations have poured in, totaling more than 1.8 million yuan in one day. An anonymous donor has also donated clothing and miscellaneous items, for which we are deeply grateful. However, the disaster is severe and the need for funds is great. We earnestly hope that enthusiastic members of the public will continue their efforts to provide generous assistance to alleviate the urgent needs and achieve significant results. We look forward to it!</p>
<h3>Temporary Relief Committee Promotes Work</h3>
<p>Manufacturers and gentry in the area have jointly established a temporary relief committee, which is operating at No. 351 Kangding Road. Wu Quan and Yuan Jiping have been appointed as general managers, Guan Fu and Zhu Wenyao as fundraising managers, Wu Yongping and Huanzhang as accountants, and Song Jinyi and Wu Songquan as relief managers, actively promoting relief efforts. The local gentry and businessman Zhu Shunlin and others have expressed their willingness to actively solicit donations and have been added to the committee. As for the recent relief work, in order to improve the method of distributing food, an temporary population certificate for disaster victims has been printed in consultation with the Huashan Branch, so that the food can be distributed with the assistance of the Baojia chiefs. Benevolent individuals from all walks of life who wish to donate, whether in cash or in kind, can entrust the committee to handle it. In order to clarify the procedures, all donations will be transferred to the Social Service Department of this newspaper for collection. The status of food distribution in recent days is as follows:</p>
<p>On the 11th, porridge was distributed once that evening by Gongyi Leather Factory and Rixin Leather Factory.</p>
<p>From the 12th to the 15th, porridge was distributed twice a day in the morning and afternoon by manufacturers in Jintai Lane.</p>
<p>On the 16th, porridge was distributed twice in the morning and afternoon by Jinqian Water Bottle Factory and Jiu Dye Factory.</p>
<p>On the 17th and 18th, porridge was distributed twice in the morning and afternoon by China Chemical Industry Company and the Xuhui Branch of Limin Bank.</p>
<h3>Calling for Better Treatment of Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>The recent surge in prices has caused panic among the general wage-earning class, especially the impoverished elementary school teachers. They teach during the day and grade papers at night, toiling all day long without any free time. They cannot take advantage of their professional positions to seek extra income, nor do they have capital to invest. Superficially, the school authorities have increased tuition this semester to improve teachers' salaries. However, it is now common to see teachers earning 10,000 yuan a month without board. Although the Education Bureau, out of consideration for the teachers, has provided special rice subsidies, for some reason, these allocations are neither distributed on time nor according to the predetermined amount of three dou per month. Even if they receive the full amount, it is barely enough to maintain their own personal lives! As for supporting families, it is even more difficult to imagine!</p>
<p>As far as I know, the children of elementary school teachers suffering from lack of education are too numerous to count! Earlier last month, the daughter of an elementary school teacher in the same neighborhood starved to death because she had no food to eat. Such tragic situations are almost unbelievable unless one witnesses them firsthand. Yet, they do not lose heart. They are very clear about their position and the importance of their responsibilities. They not only endure hardship and work hard to serve the next generation conscientiously, but also manage to find time to continue their education.</p>
<p>We cannot stand idly by and remain indifferent to the hardships faced by these elementary school teachers who bear a sacred mission. It must be understood that although they have an outstanding spirit, they are still flesh and blood and cannot withstand so much suffering! If their health is affected or they even sacrifice themselves as a result, it will be a loss to society. Even without children, who would not want their children to be educated by good teachers? For the sake of one's own children and for the sake of the future society, I sincerely hope that enthusiastic members of the public, in the spirit of human mutual assistance, will quickly provide effective assistance to these elementary school teachers who are dedicated to education. - (Yan)</p>

<h3>Group B Basketball League: Champions of Each Division Emerge</h3>

<h3>Record of the Shanghai Representatives Visit to Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>— Ding Er</p>
<p>Motivation for the Visit: Shanghai is the economic center of China, and Jiangsu Province is the most fertile region in China. Whether in history, geography, or military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, Shanghai and Jiangsu have a necessary and close relationship. It can even be said that Shanghai is the heart of Jiangsu, and Jiangsu is the body of Shanghai. The administration of Shanghai should have close ties with the administration of Jiangsu. Businessmen in Shanghai should take a cooperative attitude toward the government and the people of Jiangsu for the sake of Shanghai and Jiangsu. A month ago, when Governor Ren of Jiangsu Province was in Shanghai, he strongly emphasized the necessity of future cooperation between Jiangsu and Shanghai at the welcoming banquet of the business community and hoped that the business community in Shanghai could often go to Jiangsu for inspection. The organization of this visit to Jiangsu by Shanghai representatives is based on this motivation, on the one hand, to respond to Governor Ren's kind invitation, and on the other hand, to express the enthusiasm of all sectors in Shanghai for cooperation with Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The main points that need to be discussed clearly with the Jiangsu Provincial Government are roughly the following four points: First. The wartime population evacuation problem; Second. The problem of the development of small factories in Shanghai to various parts of Jiangsu; Third. Shanghai's private lending to farmers in Jiangsu Province; Fourth. The issue of the construction of the Suhu (Suzhou-Shanghai) highway.</p>
<h3>List of Members</h3>
<p>This visit was organized by well-known figures from all walks of life in Shanghai. The list is as follows: Yuan Deng (Head of the delegation), Advisory Committee member, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Chen Riping (Deputy Head of the delegation), Committee member, Population Evacuation Committee member, Deputy President of the Xinwen Bao. Xiang Kangyuan (Deputy Head of the delegation), Advisory Committee member, Population Evacuation Committee member, General Manager of Kangyuan Biscuit Factory. Wu Yue (Secretary General), Chief Editor of Shen Bao. Huang Jingyuan, member of the Population Evacuation Committee. Xu Guanying, Manager of Xin Ya Construction Company. Shen Changfu, General Manager of China Commercial Bank, Standing Director of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Wang Haiju, General Manager of Global Trust Bank. Wang Xiuzhen, Deputy Manager of China Chemical Industry Company. Pan Jueming, Chief Supervisor of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Head of the Sixth Section. Rong Ziyun, General Manager of Sanle Food Company. Shen Tongyi, Principal of Nanyang Model Middle School. Cao Youzhi, Reporter of Xinwen Bao. Chu Zhiqi, Reporter of New China News, etc.</p>
<h3>Itinerary</h3>
<p>Day One (12th): 8:00 a.m., visit departs from Shanghai Station. Although the visiting group had previously contacted China Central Railway, after being received at the station by personnel from China Central Railway, an assistant named Mou rudely stopped them, highlighting the poor attitude of some staff at China Central Railway towards passengers. After the host explained in many ways, they were able to enter the station and catch the train. Arrived in Suzhou at around 2:00 p.m. Yuan, Director of Education of Jiangsu Province, Wang Maoxin, Chief of the Political Affairs Department, Chen Zhanru, County Head of Wu County, had been waiting for a long time, and there were youth groups from the Jiangsu business community lined up to welcome them, which was deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the delegation visited Governor Ren at the Provincial Government. First, Yuan, the head of the delegation, stated the purpose of the visit. Chen, the deputy head of the delegation, clarified the profound meaning of the integration of Shanghai and Jiangsu. Xiang, the deputy head of the delegation, warmly presented a plan to use Dongting Mountain as a population evacuation area. Governor Ren generally agreed with the opinions of Shanghai with an earnest attitude and gave detailed instructions on the local situation and practical steps.</p>
<p>In the evening, Governor Ren hosted a banquet at the hall of the Provincial Government. Jin Yuyu, Director of the Liaison Department, Xu, Commander of the Jiangsu Garrison, and Pan, President of the Chamber of Commerce were present. During the banquet, Minister Jin Jin expressed his welcome to the Shanghai business community representatives and sincerely expressed his intention to contribute to the cooperation between Jiangsu and Shanghai.</p>
<p>On the second day, after visiting various relevant government offices and civil organizations, they visited Mudu and Lingyan for sightseeing. On the morning of the third day, at 7:00 a.m., the visiting group took a boat at Wanshou Bridge in Xumen, Suzhou, and under the leadership of Chen, the County Head of Wu County, and Liu, the Director of the Police Bureau, they headed to Dongting West Mountain, the ideal evacuation area. It took three or four hours to travel from Mudu, Xukou, into the vast Taihu Lake to West Mountain.</p>
<h3>Inspection of West Mountain</h3>
<p>The general situation of West Mountain can be briefly reported as follows:</p>
<p>Terrain: West Mountain is isolated in Taihu Lake, with an area of ​​72.5 square. The circumference is 90 miles, with small islands and undulating hills, a unique landscape.</p>
<p>Townships: West Mountain has two towns and eight villages, namely Donghe Town, Xiaoxia Town, Huili Town, Zhenxia Village. Lucun Village, Qixian Village. Qianwan Village, Dongyuan Village, Hanzhi Village, Tang Village. Each village and town is responsible for the village and town affairs.</p>
<p>Baojia (Neighborhood System): The entire area has a total of 72 bao, 716 jia, 7,319 households, and a population of 15,771 men, 13,272 women, a total of 29,043 people.</p>
<p>Public Security: Each township has a self-defense team of approximately 1,000 people, with outposts for liaison. In the event of an emergency, they can be concentrated at the district office within 18 minutes. The police have one patrol officer and twelve constables. The equipment is currently being prepared. There is also a backup Allied Force to assist in the police force.</p>
<p>Cultivated Land: There are 895 mu of cultivated land, 20,027 mu of open land, 42,617 mu of mountain fields, and 3,874 mu of bare land.</p>
<p>Products: The main products are fruits, especially the famous loquat and waxberry. The next is silk cocoon, about 2,000 dan per year. This year, due to last year's huge losses, farmers are mostly not raising silkworms. The tea is the famous Biluochun, with an annual output of 300 dan, and there are also green limestone (raw material for making lime), bluestone, and other products. Unfortunately, the local rice production is very small and mostly relies on nearby counties.</p>
<p>Baoshan and Shicheng coal mines are located at Tianwangmenkou, Nanxu Village, Donghe Town, West Mountain. Each company produces about 50 tons of coal per day. The mined coal is mostly supplied to Suzhou Power Company. However, the mining methods are all traditional and there is still much room for improvement.</p>
<p>Education: There are two district-established elementary schools, eight village-established elementary schools, and two private schools, with a total of 1,353 students. The number of school-age children enrolled is still small.</p>
<p>Transportation: There are steamers moored at Yangqiao, Suzhou, outside Xumen, Yong'an Lane, and Chichaguan Wharf. On West Mountain, there are the Qiuxian Village Houbao, and other shipping coal ships coming and going.</p>
<p>West Mountain belongs to the 13th district of Wu County. The district chief, Jin Baiqing, is a local of West Mountain and is quite capable. He has promised to cooperate with the evacuation work. West Mountain was once assigned by Hua Yanyun, director of the Suzhou Office of the Population Evacuation Committee, to Xu Xianzhang, Xu Lichang, Xu Xiang, Zhu Rongqing and others to be responsible for investigation and preparation. The village chiefs are all famous people, and the district chief is also the honorary consultant. A thorough investigation of the local public property and empty houses is currently underway, estimating the total number of displaced people that can be accommodated. A comprehensive plan for the import of food and the development of local production businesses is also underway.</p>
<h3>Gains of the Trip</h3>
<p>On the fourth day (15th), Sun, Director of Jiangsu Province Construction, happened to return from inspecting Wuxi. A meeting was held at the Weihai Restaurant. During the banquet, Director Sun said that a new line of the Suhu Highway will be built soon, running parallel to the railway from Shanghai directly to Suzhou, shortening the original route by one-third. It is expected to be completed in late July. At that time, the connection between Shanghai and Jiangsu will inevitably become closer. After the banquet, the visiting group took a train from Suzhou Station and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>In summary, the gains from the visit of Shanghai representatives to Jiangsu Province can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government expressed full approval and assistance for the issues of population evacuation, development of small factories, and agricultural loans raised by the Shanghai business representatives.</p>
<p>The visiting group traveled through wind and waves, personally visited Taihu West Mountain for inspection, and demonstrated the spirit of practical action by representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Suhu Highway is about to start construction, and closer Shanghai-Jiangsu relations can be predicted.</p>
