<p>蘇黎世十四日中央社電　英美兩國以爲蘇聯之參加對日作戰，無論如何最早亦當在數呈期之後，故對蘇職之突然對日宣戰，殊覺奇怪，而有種種之推測。據聞當波次坦會談時。特魯曼曾要求蘇聯參加戰爭，此次由九日之特魯曼　明，即可明悉其眞象。惟史太林僅於原則上大體承認，對於參戰時期則避免聲明發表。據英國日日新聞消息，蘇聯僅於發表宣戰一二小時之前，始中通知美英兩國，是故蘇聯之參戰，似爲突然決定者。論到此項成因，英美均視爲係因原子炸彈出現，蓋原子炸彈之咸力，殊有可使局勢急轉直下之可能性，是故蘇聯爲確保其東亞之發音位，故而先期動兵也。且據聞史太林曾主張東亞大陸之戰後處置問題，當由渝蘇兩國交涉解決，應與宋子文再度舉行莫斯科會談後決定，故於　子文抵莫斯科後，尙未開始交涉之前，蘇　軍業已侵入滿　，蓋蘇聯欲以武力造成旣定事實，予各方以使戰後之蓋蘇聯欲以武力造成旣定事實，予各方以使戰後之渝蘇關係乃渝美關係，導入重大危機會之恐佈，美國與論界即反應此　不安老云。</p>

<h3 id="c13">浮動的教訓 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>時局的波動乃至謠言的流傳，往往激起一時的人心浮動，這本是事理之常。但是人心的浮動，却往往會造成對社會對國極不利的結果。所以政治家處理大政，首先要求「鎭靜」，諸葛武侯有「寗靜致遠」的明訓；軍事家應付大敵，亦首先要求「沉着」，孫子兵法有「靜以制動」的方針。我們處此時代，局勢之推移，縱或有緩急之刷，但在有常識有遠見的人士，應該早已有所把握，決不會感到驚奇。只有無智識無主見的人才會　動妄行。可是，少數人的浮動，却影響了整個社會。前幾天的現象，便是浮動的敎訓。因爲浮動的結果，釀成變相停業的狀態，大多數家無隔宿之儲的平民，陷於斷炊的苦境。「前事不忘，後者之師」，我們希望全市眞正愛國的同胞，今後對於局勢之推移，當靜待當局之措置及服從當局之指示，鎮靜應付，切不可再有浮動，免生枝節。</p>
<p>中國的商人，雖在古代被一部份政治　及學者所輕視，但實際上却是中華民族中優秀的代表，他們雖然以圖利為手段，而終極目標却是貿遷物資，調節有無，有所謂「生財有道」「以義為利」的成規：海禁暢開以來，不免受歐風美雨的影響，傾向於個人主義與功利主義，但是在歐美人的眼光中，對於中國商人的一　千金，重視信義，而不如外國任至必須依靠契約的保障，久表驚異與欽佩，孫中山先生並曾以中國商人的道德，在其名著「三民主義」中一再引證，以爲中國民族道德的明證。這是値得每一個中國商界同胞自尊自重的。</p>
<p>可是，以上海近年的情形而論，我們對於所謂中國商人的道德，開始發生極大的懷疑。因爲我們每當時局波動，或者純粹因爲某種謠言，當一般市民尙無動靜之前，商人階級每每最先發出騷動，接着就在市場上掀風作浪，抬高一切物價，威脅一般市民生活，結果造成了整個社會的不安。這種乘機作惡，以圖暴利，而不惜危害一般市民社會的行動，難道可算是一種道德的行為馬？</p>
<p>商人之所以浮動而敢害及社會，其主要原因，或由於對通行幣値之不安心理。現在就我們所獲可靠消息，中日常局對於中儲劵今後之價値，已經商有穩定辦法，今後無論局勢如何推移，對於中儲劵現有之價値，不會受到影響。因此，我們希望一般商人，當共體時艱，發揮固有道德覜念，照常開市復業，不再蹈日前之覆轍。通時，我們更希望全體市民，切勿因一時局勢之推移，而自相驚擾，忙於採購物品，徒然影響一般物價之高騰，而結果自身仍不免遭受其累。</p>
<p>最後，我們認爲在此局勢波動之際，本市中日當局，務須互以全力，協同維持治安與民生，以減少人民的無痛苦。對於因少數人的煽動行爲，而足以造成使多數人痛苦的不幸者，尤當嚴密防範。</p>

<p>— 香粟</p>
<p>沿途所見</p>
<p>月之三日晨七時許，在細雨迷　中記者感車抵達北站，當時距火車開行時間尙早，見大門口旅客列伍，人數不多，，當即輕易排入，等候進站，至八時徐徐進站，另須軋票，移時軋票員駕臨，隊伍開始騷動，前撐後擠，記者費盡九牛二之力擁過軋票處後，即速赴列車。上車後見人頭寥寥，屈指可數，深以爲奇，蓋並不見如身無立足之地，進出假道窓口之擁擠現象。鐘過九時，車尙未行，時聞列軍長報吿謂車頭出軌，修理費時。至十一時半始徐徐離開上海。</p>
<p>一路行來，見途四　，片黃片綠，葱　可愛，三五耕農，炎陽之下，操作於十萬綠　中，適座旁有一來自農村之老翁，詢及收成如何，謂今年雨水調順，早稻豐收有望，並謂小麥亦已豐收；達聞之餘，不勝欣喜。</p>
<p>車過橫林，時已三點一刻，略整行李，不多時車抵常州，下車後順利經過數道檢問，　雇人力車向城內進發。</p>
<p>市容與商業</p>
<p>城周十里餘，瀕於運河，自昔以人文著，淸代古文與桐城派對峙曰陽湖派，即始於此。現因交通便利，地勢優越，京滬綫上之重要都市，且爲江南產米區之一，是故一切工商市况，僅稍次於蘇錫。</p>
<p>戰禍降臨後，近幾年來，力圖恢復，稍復前情。尤以去年來，單帮客與返鄕者絡　於街，帶來了許多都會風氣，使古老的蘭陵（常州之別稱）民風，爲之戰變。常州城中僅有橫貫南北的大街及縣直街爲最熱鬧之商市，兩旁所設店舖，其銷售者以本地土產品居多，如梳箟，羅絹，皮箱，木器，彩蛋等，昔曾名著遐邇『今則銷路大不如前。除大街而外，其他街道小巷，狹隘汚穢，尤以時値夏令，道旁瓜皮滿地，蒼蠅偏集，行人過處，滿天飛舞，　　之聲不絕於耳。至於街道建設，大街均以碎石舖面，小巷則不足論矣。</p>
<p>商市與滬略同，物價「日新月異」，繼續高漲，店家存貨，售出後不易補進，大都不願出售其貨物，故營業實銷淸淡，此爲各業之一般現象。此外有二點與上海商店所不同者，即顧客買物後之消費特稅，並不臨時收捐，而由商店向徵收處總承包，其他即貨物無標價，雖稱有內定價目單，但不無討虛頭之弊。</p>
<p>在常州亦同樣有投機市塲，每日上午九時起，若干茶會及公園中，滿緊着許多衣冠楚楚的人物，形成投機之非正式市塲，以黃金，棉紗，麵粉，小麥等為目的物，終日興風作浪，更利用長途電話與上海互通消息，爲投機之準繩，操其業者，有幸有不幸，於頃刻間，可以驟成鉅富，可以傾家蕩產。</p>
<p>娛樂斗塲所有中華常州大華與和平戲院等四所，演電影與話劇爲普通，影片均爲滬上舊片，話劇爲銀行界之業餘表演，演技幼稚，銷票由各公會攤派，此外尙有公務員及特殊階級，隨時可以免費帶人進出，據聞買　　戲者是「傻瓜」。</p>
<p>肺病的普遍</p>
<p>說常州是中醫發源地，如孟河（距治九十里之一鎭）出醫生，淸時之馬文植費伯雄輩，皆負盛名於一時。目下常州有衛生事務所之設立，所長爲王澤如醫師，醫院方面有武進醫院，縣立醫院，及江南醫院三所，至醫師方面，西醫有二三十位，中醫最盛，僅以城區已登記者有二三百位之譜（鄉區不在內），但通俗醫藥如求仙方及　神拜佛等，仍極普遍。藥房所售藥品大都爲成藥，價目較滬上高出一倍，對於配方技術過於幼稚，故醫師大抵自己配藥。</p>
<p>據謂患肺病者在常州，其普遍一如上海，但處於物質環境惡劣之今日，設備未能普及，故被發覺者尙少，即使發現，亦無良好之療養院療治。</p>
<p>今日之常州有X光之醫院，僅武進醫院一家，規定每星期三舉行檢查及注射人工氣胸，手術方面檢查者與注射者爲二人，此中難免有缺點。醫師方面以肺科專家沈乾一醫師爲最精，對病家之症狀無不悉心診治，頗爲各界稱道焉。最近常州人士對防癆工作，已有相常認識，　需各界有所提倡設立完善之療養院。</p>
<p>民生一斑</p>
<p>常州在京滬綫上亦為富饒之區，故一般物價，總較上海便宜三分二，最近受了單邦客之影響，物價亦逐步高昇，但還比上海便宜一半（除米外）。例如八月三日之物價；粳米每石（一百五十斤）六十五萬，秈米六十三萬，大豆廿六萬，元麥十五萬，小麥二十八萬五千，大麥是三萬；燃料方面如硬柴四萬餘一擔（天平秤），豆箕柴五萬餘。肉每斤六千四百元，小靑菜每斤一千五，筧菜一千元等。</p>
<p>在社會的另一面看來，小民們終日奔走所得，幾全部消耗於苛捐雜稅中，及强買强賣下。</p>
<p>看到農村，差不多可說是破產了，每畝田之負一幾超過收成所得，至於農民所食大都均爲麥粞與靑菜，吃飯的可說是十不得一。</p>
<p>蝗蟲為災</p>
<p>該邑第四區及第五區存仁鄕，於上月底曾發現大批飛蝗自西南方飛至該二處，爲害農田，影響民生至鉅，當由各機關民衆聯合捕捉，於本月初始除晉，而飛媳停留之各鄉鎮，即穴　佈，其所產卵子，最近均孵化成繭，紛紛嚙食靑菜，經二次化蛻後，跳躍敏捷，嚙食豆·稻·落花生等類，捐害田苗，比飛蝗更厲害。飛蝗爲災，尙可驅逐飛往他處，而跳蝻為害，　逐則無翅高飛，撲減則路爲之塞，田爲之蔽，滿山邁野，撲不勝撲，該處農民，睹此形狀，皆謂虫災已成，秋收絕望，均日夜憂慮。當局鑒如此災害，即公佈收買跳蝻辦法，由農民捕獲之跳蝻，賣於當局，每市斤一千元。迄目前已捕獲十餘一，現正努力撲滅中。</p>

<p>太原通訊</p>

<p>— 達林</p>
<p>山西自古爲文化發源之地，尤其是省城太原，自古即爲堯舜建都的舊地，直到現在還是常被人喩爲古唐風的，及至現在入於民國以來，尤其是目前一般文化漸漸顯然有了低落的趨勢。晋垣，這古老的都城，一向就是被人漠視的，尤其是當今舉地烽火，遍處硝烟的非常時局下，人們似乎更把它遺忘，這正是因爲它所處的環境是靠近深山，李節風吹過了各個角落，同時也吹上了那皺紋百出的古幷州的臉孔；不錯，太原是孤寂而沉悶的，　如，所謂的新民公園（海子邊），與其說是公園勿寧說一句海子邊來得爽快，因爲她也不過就是這僅僅的一泓綠水－一泓又死又臭的綠水而已，然而它在太原，則深爲一般市民所喜愛，尤其是當今炎熱地接邊彊的緣故。</p>
<p>的夏天。節直成了古老太原的寵兒，它不但成爲一時的消夏盛地，同時更變成了一般下級的江湖人，買賣任皆以戶口的唯一珍地，這裡會擁塞著各式各樣，各階層，各角落的人，上至達官顯貴，下至販夫走卒，終日在集會着。　雜著，往來著。</p>
<p>太原的烏鴉</p>
<p>烏鴉在太原是到處皆是，尤其在新民公國，更可以說是它的唯一特色，同時那因爲樹木繁茂的關係，是的，公國裏的園樹偵可以抗衡全市通衢所有的街　，也許是太原街道狹窄的關係，我還眞沒有看見那一條街栽著幾株像機的樹棵，旣或有那也僅不過寥寥的一珠兩珠罷了</p>
<p>烏鴉確是討厭，呱呱不停的呌囂，給予人總是一種不快之感，不過這裏到給海子邊憑添無限活潑的氣氛，可是你要留點神，要是傍晚走在樹林之下，說不定就會吃上鴉冀的</p>
<p>海子邊像什刹海</p>
<p>說到海子邊的性格確是有點像北京的夏之什刹海，不過沒有它的靑美而安靜，它又點像天橋，不又過稍稍帶點公園的風味，確又不可與天橋同時而語，總之，說它是十個散步的塲所則可，說它是一個什麼公園，就未免有點牽强了，還忘了內園亭之中還立着一座蘇省長的去思碑，還是在蘇公離省的時候，市民爲都念氏的功績，而特地立的，到也給圈裏添上不少美蹟。</p>
<p>太原也許是太偏僻而且是太沒落了，一切日用的東西尤其稍稍高級一點的東西，差不多都是仰仗他處得，雖然所謂山西產業是很有名，如今卻是那麼貧瘠的可憐。</p>
<p>菜蔬價格奇昂</p>
<p>就是人們日常所最　要的疏菜，都是來自外省，這是千眞萬確的事實，以致你如想吃點應時的新鮮菜蔬都是不可能。同時因爲是來自外埠加上運費它的價值確大是可觀。這時所有的人，差不多每天還是在什麽土豆菠菜裏打圈圈，連那通常的扁豆這裏也是很鮮見的，記得在北京，這時早已茴香，茄子以及什麼菜苔西葫蘆充斥在菜塲街頭了。但在這裏，就是在夏季最流行的西紅柿，竟賣到二百五一斤，這要讓上海的人士聽見偵要懷疑。至於夏季應是的西瓜，香瓜，在這裏都是論斤購買、</p>
<p>冷食店在太原雖然全市算起來，也才不過有限的幾家，生意却呈空前的蓬勃之勢，這雖說上冷兵店，選勿寗說它是冰激凌店，因為它除此以外是不　其他冷食的，至多也不過來上兩根氷棒而已。</p>
<p>沒想到女子赤足運動在太原到是非常的盛行，走到街上你可以看到各階層的女性，都把腳露出來而且都梳著雙辮，尤其是穿著靑制服的女學生們，再有街頭有不少女人穿着大花大綠的衣服，泰半多由舊和服改作，的確是新穎的很，電影院生意也是與隆的很，一部片子，動輒就是運演半月廿天，而每天總是座滿，現在正上演着周璇的「漁家女」，已經演了廿天而上座成績，還是始終不衰。某個宣傳機關，還特地因此印了一個「漁家女歌曲之頁」，上面收集了片中所有的歌曲，石印一小篇，竟　大洋十元，而買賣還是特別「興隆」，　確十一個生財有道的絕妙方策。</p>

<p>餘居重慶路一○三號，與因是靜學社相近，久欲往習，以俗事牽纏，延至三十三年秋，始加入第六期班。初坐覺萬念業集，心意未寗，且兩腿不慣盤膝，酸麻不耐久坐，問之蔣老師，曰久則自慣，毋恐毋餒。至兩月，同坐者數十人中，有前坐一人肩背微有搖動。</p>
<p>餘以母病返甬，侍奉湯藥，母歿，哀痛之餘，有感於中，返滬後勤加練習。中秋後三日晨六時，靜坐中忽覺兩腿搖動不已，初意以爲麻木使然，漸至胸腹震動，兩手脫握而出，作環抱勞，旋轉如風車，順逆互異，皆三十六轉，頭部則左右前後搖擺，亦三十六次。是日上午亟趜蔣老師處報告經過，曰：此乃初期震動。越日遇課期，因餘震動過烈，室中擺設皆爲動搖，同學因餘進步神速，私同有無秘訣，餘答以惟痛下功夫，別無秘法。</p>
<p>於農曆冬至午夜，獨睡於被內，仰臥並不盤膝試依法行之，亦能震動，且漸覺尾　關酸痛，有熱氣直上背部，肩背因之動搖不已，直上至頸骨，由頭項而至眉目，則兩眼開　不停，時而圓睜兩目，眼球分左右旋轉，由鼻分歧而下，鼻亦　動至上下顎，面頰牙槽皆震動。餘心鎮靜不亂，當斯時，舌尖本緊抵上顎內部，亦忽自震動，攪　伸縮不已，由是漸漸平靜，從胸腹複歸於臍下丹田中。恐偶而有此現象，未敢遽稟老師，及每坐皆然，乃至社中告老師，師詫爲除沈吟梅外未有如此速效者，汝三關已通，好自爲之。</p>
<p>社中遇孫道勝學兄，彼已學過大　天報，告老師雲：冬至夜有異狀，有熱氣凝結，上下於丹田間。師雲：此乃小還丹初成之象，較餘輩又進一級矣。夫靜坐乃卻病延年之法，延年須視各人根基，卻病則人人可以修得，病夫之國正爲對症良藥也。</p>

<h3 id="c36">疏散問題的幾點意見 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— 陳天卓</p>
<p>疏散人口　目前止　最重大最需要的問題，當局曾一再警告市民從速疏散，同時各方人士也曾在報　上勸告並提議疏散的辦法。</p>
<p>本來疏散人口並不是一件難事，要人離開上海，和離開上海以後怎樣，故此要疏散的人，祇是　法疏散，筆者　合管見於下：</p>
<p>㈠確保疏散之安全　很多要想疏散的當有人們不敢離開上海，不是怕沿途不安全，就是怕到的地方有綁票搶劫，所以　裏足不前。當局　　　疏散的目的，必須武裝的　　保證疏散及聯合各地的軍警，肅清疏散地　的一切障礙。</p>
<p>㈡獎到企業公司投資協助疏散　當政府確定某地在地　上，　較　宜的，使　　疏散區，獎　企業公司投資建設，開發　屋等生産事業，在企業公司本身既可　利，同時還可減輕疏散人民的費用和實際的生産。</p>
<p>㈢聯合各同鄉會　　疏散　各同鄉會對於其旅滬同鄉，聯絡較爲容易。同時集團疏散用費總較單獨爲廉。有　多在上　較近的旅滬市民，　業而　力返鄉者，設法免費　回。我相信人數一定很可觀。至於鄉間　上　很遠的人們，如閩粵湘蜀等地的人，假使要疏散到各鄉下去，人生路不　。況且鄉下人對於外來居住者，每每都顯覺得　異奇怪，尤其是我們廣東人，不　在言語中態度容貌上，都很顯著的分得出來。將來除非無事，不然就是第一個的光顧者，假使有了合同鄉集團疏散，不論在路費上，聯絡上，以及團結安全上，都比較便宜得多了。　　㈣婦孺的先行疏散　疏散的最大困難，就是疏散以後的生活，很多人遲疑不決，就爲這個緣故。所以筆者提議先著手於婦孺疏散，面其生活負擔者本人仍可在上　做事，　樣方能繼續維持其自己及一家的生活，所以當局要先設法婦孺疏散才是解決疏散的第一步　法。</p>
<p>㈤確保滙款　疏散後當然要獲得生活接濟，所以先　穩定滙款，由當局指導中儲及其他銀行於疏散各地　設立特別滙款部，滙款手續要迅速穩妥。必要時滙款未到或發生其他事件而不能滙時，銀行得　　之。</p>
<p>㈥保護交通便利　疏散是需要交通，交通的便利不　求像平時一樣，但也得　有什麽阻礙，如黑市車票，車役　難敲詐及振興水運等一律要改善，同時對於　　及日用物品也得予以便利　　。假如祇能單身疏散到某地，到了某地，又更　新購置家具用品，況內地貴而且缺乏，　普遍一　能力所能及。</p>
<p>㈦組織疏散民衆自衛團　疏散後集團的力量比較大，聯絡容易，爲求疏散後的安全，當由政府於疏散區指導疏散民衆組織自衛團，集群衆之力量以　衛自己。</p>
<p>㈧工商業機關之　移　民衆於疏散後，疏散地域當然隨人口而繁榮，那末工商機關，也可隨之遷移。同時在該機關服務之職員也可隨之而疏散，這樣無形中，在各鄉間做成若幹專利都市矣。</p>
<p>㈨疏散費問題　疏散用費要力求經濟普通化，假使要人民負擔數目太大，　　計劃等於紙上空談，讓得有位某先生發表主張以太湖　疏散區疏散費每人五十萬元（當時米祗有四萬元一　　，區區之五十萬　不　多，不盡在現在這個社會環境中，實在太不普遍化了。比如一家十口便要五百萬，少的五口便要二百五十萬元，除了少數人能付得出外，我相信上海百分之九十五以上是吃不消的。上海的一般店鋪的退職金多數是兩個月至六個月的薪水，最多的不過三四十萬元，同時還可以看得出上海人因經濟力不足以致身體孱弱現象，大家也許不留意吧，不論在戲院或教堂內，　圍總是不停的咳聲，不是前面，就是後面，二片吵耳，這就是因營養不足而起的病態，食猶不夠，還有何餘資而疏散　。這　　是疏散上海人口的一個大問題。那麽何以疏散呢？現在筆者提議幾條容易而實際的辦法於下：以後有關當局之參攷實行：</p>
<p>㈠疏散地點之圈定。</p>
<p>㈡聯合同鄉會，保甲登記疏散婦孺老弱。</p>
<p>㈢設立穩固滙款　　。</p>
<p>㈣當局選精良警士（或可利用被裁者）組織疏散警衛隊保護疏散。</p>
<p>㈤消弭一切不法之留難勒索。</p>
<p>㈥自滬到疏散地區，物資免稅自由運輸。</p>
<p>㈦當局與華鐵相商配給一部客票，由疏散委員分配與各疏散者。</p>
<p>㈧調查獎勱或勒令有餘資不事生産而傾向投機囤積之企業實業公司投資於疏散事業。</p>
<p>㈨組織木船運輸公司與木船製造廠，以利水運。</p>
<p>㈩聯合墾　農業建築公司，從事於疏散　帶開墾種植建造房屋。</p>
<p>㈩㈠招募在滬失業壯丁，從事於開墾疏散事業。</p>
<p>㈩㈡政府當局聯合同鄉會對無力返鄉者予以經濟補助。</p>
<p>以上十二條辦法爲疏散最基本易於實行的辦法，當局決辦到，則疏散問題使迎刃而解了。</p>
<h3 id="c37">疏散學校之重要性及疏散辦法 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— 陸慎廷</p>
<p>報章披露疏散人口之勸告，已數月於茲。然而市民遲遲未動，極少遵行。其原因不外下列三項：㈠鄉村生活不及上　舒適。㈡缺少金錢，行旅艱難，或疏散後無以爲生。㈢子女在滬求學，一日疏散則使子女之學業中止，是故遲疑未決。更以一上海人口極多，吾何憂哉！自慰。然而今已不然，環境使吾人不能再留，故第一項原因或理由已不複存在，第二項原因亦正設法克複中；至於不易克複者，實爲第三項原因耳。</p>
<p>學校一日不疏散，大多數學生一日不收擅離，學生一日不收擅　，其家屬固不能離開上海，於是疏散人口難以達到目的。倘若學校可以疏散，則學生必無　　之心，學生家屬亦必連作歸鄉之計，而疏散人口之目的亦易於達到矣。是　疏散學校爲當今最緊急最重要之問題，且宜先於其他　體而疏散之。</p>
<p>一般人之見解，　爲疏散學校　事實所不能：如校舍校具教師學生以及教師家屬學生家屬……如何遷移？經費之鉅，何止萬萬？實際無法搬動，故至今猶未疏散。</p>
<p>然則差矣！疏散學校之辦法並不如此。換言之，疏散學校乃“解散上海學校，另設農村學校”而已。目前上海之學校，宜從速宣告解散，以堅定學生及其家屬歸鄉之心發給相當之經費，使教員得攜家屬歸鄉或擇地疏散。及至到達鄉間，即可租借廟堂，教堂以及大戶之餘屋，開設小範圍之學校，成舊學熱式而行新教育制。教育當局可派遣督學來往於村鎮之間負責指導；需過　當時日，施行考試，凡及格者發給證明書，則不致使疏散其中之韶光虛度也。</p>
<p>學校工作，宜從市教育局著手，市立學校以身作則，首先創行，私立學校亦必羣起而從之。倘能如此，不但學生及其家屬或安心疏散，而且新教育之　　亦可一洗閉塞之農村。進而言之，中國文化之水凖，並將爲此而“振也”。</p>

<h3 id="e6">Reactions to Soviet Entry into the War <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Zurich, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Britain and the United States believed that the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan would not occur for at least several weeks. Therefore, they found the Soviet Union's sudden declaration of war against Japan to be quite strange, and there are various speculations. It is said that during the Potsdam Conference, Truman requested the Soviet Union's participation in the war. This can be clearly understood from Truman's announcement on the 9th. However, Stalin only generally agreed in principle and avoided making any statements regarding the timing of participation. According to a British Daily News report, the Soviet Union only notified Britain and the United States one or two hours before issuing the declaration of war. Therefore, the Soviet Union's participation seems to have been a sudden decision. Regarding the reasons for this, Britain and the United States both believe that it is due to the emergence of the atomic bomb. The power of the atomic bomb has the potential to rapidly change the situation. Therefore, in order to secure its position in East Asia, the Soviet Union took action early. Furthermore, it is said that Stalin had proposed that the post-war handling of the East Asian continent be resolved through negotiations between the Soviet Union and Chongqing, and that a second Moscow meeting should be held with Soong Tzu-wen to make a decision. Therefore, before Soong Tzu-wen arrived in Moscow and negotiations began, Soviet troops had already invaded Manchuria. This is because the Soviet Union wanted to create a *fait accompli* by force, creating the impression that the post-war relationship between Chongqing and the Soviet Union would endanger the relationship between Chongqing and the United States, which is causing great unease.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Japanese Invention of Special Medicine for Treating Burns <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – A newly invented Japanese internal medicine has been highly effective in treating burns since the March 10th Tokyo air raid. In particular, it has demonstrated miraculous effects when air-dropped to those injured by the atomic bomb in Hiroshima City. The medicine currently comes in two types: "Rainbow Wave" and "Purple Light." The raw materials for the newly invented medical agent "Rainbow Wave" are chemically synthesized substances from Japanese [unclear] lines and photosensitive pigments, directly collecting the natural power of the sun, pioneering a new field in modern chemistry and realizing the dream of chemists. The harmonizing agents for "Rainbow Wave" number about one hundred, each with its own special efficacy. Currently, "Rainbow Wave No. 1" and "Purple Light" are being used.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Criticism Arises from All Sides Regarding the Use of the Atomic Bomb <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Currently, various opinions around the world regarding the inhuman act of using the atomic bomb, in addition to newspapers in Switzerland, Sweden, and other neutral countries issuing condemnations, the most influential economic magazine in Britain has also published an article titled "Exposing Anarchy in Civilization" to criticize it. Dr. Ichiro Kiyose, a legal scholar and the Director of the Japan Political Society, has also stated that the use of atomic bombs is a problem that cannot be taken lightly from a humanitarian standpoint, and its use should be completely prohibited to establish morality. According to the British Daily Mail, the British Labour Party has unanimously stated its absolute opposition to the use of atomic bombs. The attitude of British Prime Minister Attlee towards this matter is particularly noteworthy. According to enemy claims, the atomic bomb was only successfully researched on July 15th, but this is mere falsehood. In reality, this bomb was completed long ago. The fact that it was not used on Germany but on Japan is also quite puzzling. It is likely that if it were used on fellow white people, the reaction would be exceptionally strong. Some say that it should be transferred to international administrators, but if that were the case, its free use would not be a problem. Therefore, we must strive to completely eliminate it.</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Lesson of Instability <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The fluctuations of the situation and even the spread of rumors often stir up temporary instability in people's hearts, which is a common occurrence. However, this instability can often lead to results that are extremely detrimental to society and the country. Therefore, when dealing with major policies, statesmen must first strive for "composure." Zhuge Liang had the maxim "Tranquility leads to far-reaching vision." When facing powerful enemies, military strategists must first strive for "calmness." Sun Tzu's Art of War has the principle of "Using stillness to control movement." In this era, even if the changes in the situation have varying degrees of urgency, those with common sense and foresight should have already grasped the situation and would not feel surprised. Only those without knowledge or independent judgment would act rashly. However, the instability of a few affects the entire society. The phenomenon of the past few days is a lesson in instability. Because the instability resulted in a disguised state of business suspension, the majority of ordinary people who have no savings to last overnight were plunged into the misery of being cut off from supplies. "Do not forget the past, it is a teacher for the future." We hope that all genuinely patriotic compatriots in the city will, in the future, calmly await the authorities' measures and obey their instructions regarding the changes in the situation, and handle the situation calmly, avoiding further instability and complications.</p>
<p>Chinese merchants, although despised by some politicians and scholars in ancient times, are actually outstanding representatives of the Chinese nation. Although they use profit as a means, their ultimate goal is to trade goods and adjust surpluses and deficits, with established principles of "earning wealth with integrity" and "taking righteousness as profit." Since the opening of maritime trade, they have inevitably been influenced by Western trends and leaned towards individualism and utilitarianism. However, in the eyes of Westerners, Chinese merchants value faith and righteousness above gold, unlike foreigners who must rely on the protection of contracts, which has long been a source of surprise and admiration. Sun Yat-sen even repeatedly cited the morality of Chinese merchants in his famous book "The Three Principles of the People" as evidence of the morality of the Chinese nation. This is something that every Chinese merchant compatriot should respect and value.</p>
<p>However, considering the situation in Shanghai in recent years, we have begun to have great doubts about the so-called morality of Chinese merchants. Because whenever there is a fluctuation in the situation, or purely because of some rumor, before the general public has even reacted, the merchant class is often the first to cause a stir, and then they stir up trouble in the market, raising the prices of all goods and threatening the lives of the general public, resulting in unrest throughout society. Can this kind of opportunistic evil, seeking exorbitant profits, and disregarding the harm to the general public be considered a moral act?</p>
<p>The main reason why merchants are unstable and dare to harm society may be due to unease about the value of the currency in circulation. Based on reliable information we have obtained, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have already discussed stable measures for the future value of the Central Reserve Bank Notes. Regardless of how the situation changes in the future, the current value of the Central Reserve Bank Notes will not be affected. Therefore, we hope that the general merchants will share the difficulties together, demonstrate their inherent moral concepts, resume business as usual, and not repeat the mistakes of the past. At the same time, we further hope that all citizens will not be alarmed by the changes in the situation and rush to purchase goods, which would only lead to a surge in general prices, and ultimately they themselves will inevitably suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that in this time of fluctuating circumstances, the Chinese and Japanese authorities in this city must mutually exert their full strength to jointly maintain public order and people's livelihood, in order to reduce the suffering of the people. We must especially prevent those who, through the instigation of a few, are able to cause the misfortune of the suffering of many.</p>

<h3 id="e14">A Trip to Changzhou: Observations Along the Way <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Su</p>
<p>Observations Along the Way</p>
<p>Around 7 AM on the third of the month, amidst the misty drizzle, this reporter felt the car arrive at the North Station. It was still early before the train's departure time. I saw a queue of passengers at the gate, not many in number. I easily joined the line and waited to enter the station. Around 8 AM, we slowly moved into the station, where tickets had to be punched. After a while, the ticket inspector arrived, and the line began to stir, with people pushing from the front and squeezing from the back. I spent a great deal of effort pushing through the ticket punch area and quickly headed to the train. After boarding, I saw only a few people, easily counted. I found this odd, as there was no overcrowding, nor the squeezing through windows. After nine o'clock, the train still hadn't departed. I heard an announcement stating that the engine had derailed and would take time to repair. It wasn't until 11:30 AM that we slowly left Shanghai.</p>
<p>Along the way, I saw fields, some yellow, some green, lush and lovely. Three or five farmers, under the blazing sun, toiled in the vast green fields. Next to me sat an old man from the countryside. I asked him about the harvest. He said that the rain had been timely this year, and a good harvest of early rice was expected, adding that the wheat had also been bountiful. Hearing this, I was overjoyed.</p>
<p>The train passed through Henglin, and it was already 3:15 PM. After tidying up my luggage, the train soon arrived in Changzhou. After getting off, I smoothly passed through several checkpoints and hired a rickshaw to head into the city.</p>
<p>Cityscape and Commerce</p>
<p>The city's perimeter is over ten li, bordering the Grand Canal. Since ancient times, it has been known for its culture. During the Qing Dynasty, the Yanghu School, a rival to the Tongcheng School of classical prose, originated here. Now, due to convenient transportation and its advantageous location, it is an important city on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and one of the rice-producing areas of Jiangnan. Therefore, its commerce and industry are only slightly behind Suzhou and Wuxi.</p>
<p>After the war, in recent years, efforts have been made to recover, somewhat restoring the past. Especially in the past year, peddlers and returning residents have frequented the streets, bringing much urban style and changing the ancient customs of Lanling (Changzhou's alias). Within Changzhou city, only the north-south main street and Xianzhi Street are the busiest commercial areas. The shops on both sides mostly sell local products, such as combs, silk, leather trunks, woodenware, and painted eggs, which were once famous far and wide, but now sales are far from what they used to be. Apart from the main street, other streets and alleys are narrow and dirty. Especially in the summer, melon rinds litter the roadsides, attracting swarms of flies, which fill the air as pedestrians pass by, with buzzing sounds constantly in the ears. As for street construction, the main streets are paved with gravel, while the alleys are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The market is similar to Shanghai, with prices "changing daily" and continuing to rise. Shopkeepers are reluctant to sell their goods because it is difficult to restock after selling their inventory. Therefore, business is generally slow, which is a common phenomenon in all industries. In addition, there are two differences from Shanghai shops: the consumption tax on goods purchased by customers is not collected temporarily but is contracted by the shop from the collection office. The other is that goods are not priced, and although there is a set price list, there is still the problem of overcharging.</p>
<p>There is also a speculative market in Changzhou. Every day from nine o'clock in the morning, many well-dressed figures fill some tea houses and parks, forming an informal speculative market, with gold, cotton yarn, flour, and wheat as targets. They stir up trouble all day long, using long-distance telephones to communicate with Shanghai to set the standard for speculation. Those who engage in this business can become rich overnight or go bankrupt in an instant, depending on their luck.</p>
<p>There are four entertainment venues: Zhonghua, Changzhou, Dahua, and Heping Theatres, etc., which usually show movies and dramas. The films are old ones from Shanghai, and the dramas are amateur performances by the banking industry, with childish acting skills. Tickets are distributed by various guilds. In addition, civil servants and special classes can bring people in and out for free at any time. It is said that those who buy tickets are "fools."</p>
<p>The Prevalence of Lung Disease</p>
<p>It is said that Changzhou is the birthplace of traditional Chinese medicine. Doctors from Menghe (a town ninety li from the city), such as Ma Wenzhi and Fei Boxiong in the Qing Dynasty, were famous for a time. Currently, Changzhou has a health office, headed by Dr. Wang Zeru. In terms of hospitals, there are Wujin Hospital, County Hospital, and Jiangnan Hospital. As for doctors, there are twenty to thirty Western doctors, while traditional Chinese medicine is most prevalent, with two to three hundred registered in the urban area alone (not including rural areas). However, folk medicine such as seeking immortal prescriptions and worshiping gods is still very common. Most of the medicines sold in pharmacies are ready-made, and the prices are twice as high as in Shanghai. The prescription techniques are too immature, so doctors mostly dispense their own medicines.</p>
<p>It is said that the prevalence of lung disease in Changzhou is as common as in Shanghai. However, in today's poor material environment, equipment is not yet widespread, so few are discovered. Even if they are discovered, there are no good sanatoriums for treatment.</p>
<p>Today, the only hospital in Changzhou with X-ray equipment is Wujin Hospital, which holds examinations and artificial pneumothorax injections every Wednesday. There are two people for examinations and injections, which is inevitable. In terms of doctors, Dr. Shen Qanyi, a lung specialist, is the most skilled. He carefully diagnoses and treats the symptoms of patients, which is highly praised by all sectors. Recently, people in Changzhou have become more aware of tuberculosis prevention and need all sectors to promote the establishment of perfect sanatoriums.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Changzhou is also a wealthy area on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Therefore, general prices are always two-thirds cheaper than Shanghai. Recently, due to the influence of peddlers, prices have gradually increased, but they are still half cheaper than Shanghai (except for rice). For example, the prices on August 3rd: japonica rice was 650,000 per stone (150 catties), indica rice was 630,000, soybeans were 260,000, buckwheat was 150,000, wheat was 285,000, and barley was 30,000. In terms of fuel, hard firewood was over 40,000 per dan (balance scale), and bean stalk firewood was over 50,000. Meat was 6,400 yuan per catty, small green vegetables were 1,500 yuan per catty, and water spinach was 1,000 yuan, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the small people spend almost all their daily earnings on exorbitant taxes and forced buying and selling.</p>
<p>Looking at the countryside, it can almost be said that it is bankrupt. The burden of debt per mu of land exceeds the income from the harvest. As for the food eaten by farmers, most of it is wheat dregs and green vegetables. Eating rice is rare.</p>
<p>Locust Plague</p>
<p>In the fourth and fifth districts of the county, in Renxiang Township, large numbers of locusts were found flying from the southwest at the end of last month, harming farmland and greatly affecting people's livelihood. The agencies and the public jointly captured them, and the locusts were removed at the beginning of this month. However, the towns and villages where the locusts stayed are now covered with eggs. Recently, these eggs have hatched into nymphs, which are eating green vegetables. After two molts, they jump nimbly and eat beans, rice, peanuts, and other crops, damaging seedlings even more severely than locusts. Locusts can be driven away to other places, but the wingless nymphs cannot fly away when driven. If you try to kill them, the roads are blocked, and the fields are covered. They are all over the mountains and fields, and it is impossible to kill them all. The farmers there, seeing this situation, all say that the insect plague has become a disaster and the autumn harvest is hopeless, and they are worried day and night. In view of such a disaster, the authorities announced a method of buying nymphs. The nymphs captured by farmers are sold to the authorities for 1,000 yuan per market catty. To date, more than ten thousand catties have been captured, and efforts are being made to eradicate them.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Berne, 14th – According to a Paris report: Pétain's defense lawyer, Byrne, stated during his defense yesterday: "He can gather the testimonies of forty-three defense witnesses." He continued, "When I heard that Prosecutor Monnard wanted to sentence Pétain to death, I could not restrain my grief. I am not defending Pétain's life, but Pétain's reputation. Now, I only hope to do my best today to prove that Pétain is in no way responsible for France's defeat. Those responsible for France's defeat are politicians who slander Pétain." Afterwards, he defended Pétain regarding the signing of the armistice agreement, saying: "Pétain did not abandon the entire France. The signing of this armistice agreement was Pétain's helpless means to protect the common people. No one in Britain condemns me for the armistice agreement. Churchill himself first suggested considering that Britain should agree to France not continuing its anti-war work on March 28, 1940 when necessary. Therefore, Britain cannot be indignant now, and my France has not violated the agreement, nor has it damaged France's prestige." The trial was interrupted at 3:30.</p>

<p>Taiyuan Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e19">Talking about Taiyuan in the Hot Summer <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Darlin</p>
<p>Shanxi has been the place of origin of culture since ancient times, especially Taiyuan, the provincial capital, which has been the old capital built by Yao and Shun since ancient times, and is still often compared to the ancient Tang style. Since the Republic of China, especially now, the general culture has gradually shown a downward trend. Jin Yuan, this ancient capital, has always been ignored, especially in the current extraordinary period of war, where the smoke of gunpowder spreads everywhere, people seem to forget it even more, precisely because its environment is close to the deep mountains, and the Li Festival wind blows through every corner, and also blows on the wrinkled face of the ancient Bingzhou; that's right, Taiyuan is lonely and dull, such as the so-called Xinmin Park (Haizi Bian), it is better to say that it is a Haizi Bian than a park, because it is just this mere pool of green water - a pool of dead and smelly green water, but in Taiyuan, it is deeply loved by the general public, especially because of the hot summer bordering the frontiers.</p>
<p>The summer season has become the darling of ancient Taiyuan. It has not only become a popular place for cooling off, but also the only precious place for the general lower-class Jianghu people, trading, and household registration, where all kinds of people from all classes and corners gather, from high-ranking officials and dignitaries to peddlers, all day long. Mixed together, coming and going.</p>
<p>Taiyuan's Crows</p>
<p>Crows are everywhere in Taiyuan, especially in Xinmin Park, which can be said to be its only feature, and because of the lush trees, yes, the garden trees in the park can resist all the streets in the city, perhaps because the streets of Taiyuan are narrow, I really haven't seen a street planted with several tree trunks, even if there are, it's just a few.</p>
<p>Crows are indeed annoying, the croaking and incessant calling always gives people an unpleasant feeling, but here it adds an infinite lively atmosphere to Haizi Bian, but you have to be careful, if you walk under the trees in the evening, you may get hit by crow droppings.</p>
<p>Haizi Bian is like Shichahai</p>
<p>Speaking of the character of Haizi Bian, it is indeed a bit like Beijing's Shichahai in summer, but without its Qing beauty and quietness, it is a bit like Tianqiao, but it has a bit of a park flavor, but it cannot be compared with Tianqiao at the same time. In short, it can be said that it is a place for ten people to take a walk, but it is a bit far-fetched to say that it is a park. It is also forgotten that there is a monument to Governor Su in the inner garden pavilion, which was specially erected by the citizens when Duke Su left the province to commemorate his achievements, which also added a lot of beauty to the circle.</p>
<p>Taiyuan is perhaps too remote and too decadent, and almost all daily necessities, especially those that are slightly more advanced, rely on other places, although the so-called Shanxi industry is very famous, but now it is so poor and pitiful.</p>
<p>Vegetable Prices are Surprisingly High</p>
<p>Even the vegetables that people need most every day come from other provinces, which is a true fact, so it is impossible to eat seasonal fresh vegetables. At the same time, because it comes from other places plus shipping costs, its value is indeed considerable. At this time, almost everyone is still circling around potatoes and spinach every day, and even the usual broad beans are very rare here. I remember in Beijing, at this time, there were already fennel, eggplant, and what kind of cabbage and zucchini filling the vegetable markets. But here, even tomatoes, which are the most popular in summer, are sold for 250 yuan a catty, which Shanghai people would suspect when they hear it. As for watermelons and cantaloupes, which should be available in summer, they are bought by the catty here.</p>
<p>Although there are only a few cold food stores in Taiyuan, the business is unprecedentedly prosperous. Although it is called a cold food store, it is better to say that it is an ice cream store, because it does not sell other cold foods except for this, at most it only comes with two popsicles.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the barefoot movement of women is very popular in Taiyuan. Walking on the street, you can see women of all classes exposing their feet and wearing double braids, especially female students wearing green uniforms. There are also many women on the street wearing large floral and green clothes, most of which are remade from old kimonos, which is indeed very novel. The movie theater business is also very prosperous, a movie often runs for half a month or twenty days, and it is always full every day. Now Zhou Xuan's "Fisher Girl" is being shown, and it has been playing for twenty days, and the attendance rate is still not declining. A propaganda agency specially printed a "Fisher Girl Song Page" for this reason, which collected all the songs in the film, a small lithograph, actually selling for ten oceans, and the business is still particularly "prosperous," which is indeed a great strategy for making money.</p>

<p>Hoping that all industry guilds will follow suit. All industries in Shanghai have guilds, but there are not many who can be public-spirited, automatically raise funds to help students. Yesterday, the bicycle industry guild donated 2 million yuan each to the Shen and Xin newspapers' student loan funds. This fund was raised from all members. The person in charge of the guild is enthusiastic about education and has been working hard to appeal, which is truly commendable. After receiving the funds, the colleagues are deeply grateful and express their gratitude on behalf of thousands of children. It is hoped that other industry guilds can also follow suit and be willing to help others. Here is the original letter: "We have long admired your newspaper for running the student loan fund to benefit poor students and cultivate talents. We are very impressed by your enthusiasm and perseverance. Our guild has raised a total of 4 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates from all members, which will be distributed to your newspaper and the Xinwen Newspaper to rescue students who have dropped out of school, named as the "Bicycle Industry Guild Members Team," to contribute our meager strength. We specially send 2 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates with this letter, hoping you will accept it."</p>
<p>The International Lecture Hall is Enthusiastic about Helping Students: "We sincerely admire your esteemed hall for holding student loans to benefit poor students and your enthusiasm for public welfare. Here is a check for 100,000 Central Reserve Certificates, hoping you will accept it and name it the Pharmacy Team, and we pray for your good governance.

<p>Due to the recent rumors, ignorant merchants and civilians in this city were frightened, causing a chaotic situation. Market speculators took the opportunity to incite price hikes, and even many industrial, commercial factories and companies closed down for no reason and refused to sell goods.

<p>It has been found that donations to the Air Raid Relief Fund from all sectors of this city are quite enthusiastic. In addition to being collected and forwarded by major newspapers and relevant agencies, it is learned that a certain citizen from the Municipal Finance Bureau has separately donated two hundred million yuan to the relief fund, which has been forwarded by the bureau to the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Increased Exchange of Bank and Money Shop Instruments <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Due to the increasing volume of negotiable instruments, the banking and money shop industries in this city have implemented a next-day exchange system for instruments, hoping to resolve all difficulties arising from them. However, these difficulties have not only failed to decrease but have, in fact, become more pronounced than before. It is understood that banks are experiencing multiplied difficulties in collection, transfer, and exchange due to the increased volume of instruments from fellow institutions. In addition to significantly increasing staff at the Clearing House and strengthening exchange operations, they have also recently implemented a preliminary exchange among correspondent institutions to ensure complete procedures before the formal exchange takes place. Unofficial estimates suggest that the interbank instrument exchange rate for the past month increased by approximately 250% to 300% compared to the previous month. This is because the money shops' instrument exchange figures for the past month have already increased by over 250%, and the banks' increase is undoubtedly higher than that of the money shops. Investigations reveal that the main reason for the sharp increase in instruments for both industries is the rising prices, which have caused the value of instruments to increase in proportion to the rise in prices. The so-called shortage of cash is only a secondary factor.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Self-Healing Through Illness <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Bennian</p>
<p>I live at 103 Chongqing Road, near the Yinshi Jingxue Society. I had long wanted to learn there, but was delayed by mundane affairs until I joined the sixth class in the autumn of the 33rd year. At first, when I sat, I felt all kinds of thoughts gathering, and my mind was unsettled. Moreover, my legs were not used to sitting cross-legged, and the soreness and numbness were unbearable. I asked Teacher Jiang, who said that I would get used to it over time, and not to be afraid or discouraged. After two months, among the dozens of people sitting together, one person sitting in front of me had a slight swaying of his shoulders and back.</p>
<p>I returned to Ningbo to care for my sick mother, serving her with medicine and soup. After my mother passed away, filled with sorrow, I returned to Shanghai and diligently practiced. On the morning of the third day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, at 6:00 AM, while meditating, I suddenly felt my legs shaking uncontrollably. At first, I thought it was caused by numbness, but gradually the vibration spread to my chest and abdomen. My hands slipped out of their grip and began to rotate like a windmill, embracing the air. The rotation was both clockwise and counterclockwise, each for thirty-six turns. My head also swayed from side to side and back and forth, also thirty-six times. That morning, I rushed to Teacher Jiang to report what had happened. He said: "This is the initial vibration." The next day, when the class met, my vibrations were so strong that the furnishings in the room shook. My classmates, seeing my rapid progress, secretly asked if I had any secret methods. I replied that I only worked hard and had no other secrets.</p>
<p>On the night of the winter solstice, alone in bed, I lay on my back without crossing my legs and tried to perform the practice. I was also able to vibrate, and gradually felt soreness in the tailbone area, with heat rising directly up my back, causing my shoulders and back to sway continuously, straight up to the neck bones, from the head to the eyebrows. Then my eyes opened and closed uncontrollably, sometimes wide open, and my eyeballs rotated left and right. The vibration branched down from the nose, and the nose also vibrated, down to the upper and lower jaws, and the cheeks and jawbones all vibrated. I remained calm and composed. At that time, the tip of my tongue, which was originally pressed tightly against the inner roof of my mouth, suddenly vibrated, stirring and stretching uncontrollably, and gradually I became calm, returning from the chest and abdomen to the dantian below the navel. Fearing that this phenomenon was only occasional, I did not dare to immediately report to the teacher. But it happened every time I sat, so I told the teacher in the society. The teacher was amazed, saying that no one had had such a rapid effect except for Shen Yinmei. "Your three gates are open, take good care of yourself."</p>
<p>In the society, I met Brother Sun Daosheng, who had already studied the Great Zhou Tian Bao. He told the teacher: "On the night of the winter solstice, there was a strange phenomenon, with heat condensing and moving up and down between the dantians." The teacher said: "This is the sign of the initial formation of the small elixir, and you are one level ahead of us." Meditation is a method of preventing illness and prolonging life. Prolonging life depends on each person's foundation, but preventing illness is something everyone can achieve. The sickness of a sick person is precisely the right medicine.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Some Opinions on Evacuation Issues <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Tianzhuo</p>
<p>Evacuating the population is currently the most important and necessary issue. The authorities have repeatedly warned citizens to evacuate as soon as possible, and various people have also advised and proposed evacuation methods in newspapers.</p>
<p>Originally, evacuating the population is not a difficult task. What people leaving Shanghai and what happens after leaving Shanghai, therefore the people who want to evacuate are just unable to evacuate. I humbly offer my views below:</p>
<p>1.  Ensure the Safety of Evacuation: Many people who want to evacuate are afraid to leave Shanghai, either because they are afraid of the danger along the way, or because they are afraid of kidnapping and robbery in the places they arrive. To achieve the purpose of evacuation, the authorities must provide armed escorts to ensure evacuation and unite with the military police in various places to eliminate all obstacles in the evacuation areas.</p>
<p>2.  Reward Companies to Invest and Assist in Evacuation: When the government determines that a certain place is geographically suitable, a suitable evacuation area should be established. Companies should be rewarded for investing in construction and developing housing and other productive enterprises. The companies themselves can profit, and at the same time, the cost and actual production of evacuating people can be reduced.</p>
<p>3.  Unite Various Hometown Associations to Assist in Evacuation: Hometown associations are more likely to contact their fellow townsmen in Shanghai. At the same time, group evacuation is generally cheaper than individual evacuation. Many Shanghai residents who are relatively close to their hometowns are unemployed but have the strength to return home. Efforts should be made to provide free transportation back. I believe the number will be considerable. As for people whose hometowns are far away, such as those from Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, and Sichuan, if they are to be evacuated to their respective hometowns, the journey of life is not easy. Moreover, rural people often show strangeness and suspicion towards outsiders, especially we Cantonese, who are very distinct in our language, attitude, and appearance. Unless nothing happens in the future, otherwise they are likely to be the first to be targeted. If there is a group evacuation with fellow townsmen, it is much cheaper in terms of travel expenses, communication, and solidarity and safety.</p>
<p>4.  Prioritize the Evacuation of Women and Children: The biggest difficulty in evacuation is the life after evacuation, which is why many people hesitate. Therefore, I propose to start with the evacuation of women and children, while those who support their families can still work in Shanghai, so that they can continue to maintain their own and their families' lives. Therefore, the authorities should first find ways to evacuate women and children, which is the first step in solving the evacuation problem.</p>
<p>5.  Ensure Remittances: After evacuation, it is natural to need financial support for living, so first stabilize remittances. The authorities should instruct the Central Bank and other banks to set up special remittance departments in various evacuation areas. The remittance procedures should be quick and reliable. If necessary, the bank should advance money in case the remittance does not arrive or other events prevent the remittance.</p>
<p>6.  Protect Convenient Transportation: Evacuation requires transportation. The convenience of transportation does not need to be the same as usual, but there must be no obstacles, such as black market tickets, difficult and extortionate transportation workers, and revitalization of water transport, all of which must be improved. At the same time, daily necessities must also be facilitated. If one can only evacuate to a certain place alone, and then needs to purchase new furniture and supplies, and the inland is expensive and lacking, it is not something that the average person can afford.</p>
<p>7.  Organize Evacuated People's Self-Defense Groups: After evacuation, the strength of the group is greater and communication is easier. For the sake of safety after evacuation, the government should guide the evacuated people to organize self-defense groups in the evacuation areas, using the power of the masses to defend themselves.</p>
<p>8.  Relocation of Industrial and Commercial Institutions: After the evacuation of the people, the evacuation areas will naturally prosper with the population. Then, industrial and commercial institutions can also be relocated accordingly. At the same time, the employees serving in these institutions can also be evacuated accordingly. In this way, some special cities will be formed in various rural areas.</p>
<p>9.  Evacuation Costs: The evacuation costs should be as economical and common as possible. If the people are required to bear too large a number, the plan is equal to empty talk on paper. Someone once proposed to use Taihu Lake as an evacuation area, with an evacuation fee of 500,000 yuan per person (at that time, rice was only 40,000 yuan per dan). That is really not too universal in the current social environment. For example, a family of ten would cost 5 million, and a family of five would cost 2.5 million. Apart from a few people who can afford it, I believe that 95% of Shanghai people cannot afford it. The retirement pay of ordinary shops in Shanghai is mostly two to six months' salary, and the most is only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. At the same time, it can also be seen that Shanghai people are physically weak due to insufficient economic strength. Everyone may not notice it, but whether in the theater or in the church, the sound of coughing is always incessant, either in front or behind, and the ears are noisy. This is a disease caused by insufficient nutrition. Even eating is not enough, so where is there extra money to evacuate? This is a big problem in evacuating the population of Shanghai. So how to evacuate? Now I propose several easy and practical methods below for future reference and implementation by the relevant authorities:</p>
<p>1.  Determine the evacuation locations.</p>
<p>2.  Unite the hometown associations and Baojia to register evacuated women, children, the old, and the weak.</p>
<p>3.  Establish stable remittance agencies.</p>
<p>4.  The authorities should select excellent police officers (or use those who have been laid off) to organize evacuation guard teams to protect the evacuation.</p>
<p>5.  Eliminate all illegal difficulties and extortions.</p>
<p>6.  Goods from Shanghai to the evacuation areas should be tax-free and freely transported.</p>
<p>7.  The authorities should negotiate with China Railway to allocate some passenger tickets, which will be distributed to the evacuees by the evacuation committee.</p>
<p>8.  Investigate, reward, or order enterprises and industrial companies that have surplus funds but do not engage in production and tend to speculation and hoarding to invest in evacuation undertakings.</p>
<p>9.  Organize wooden boat transportation companies and wooden boat manufacturing plants to facilitate water transportation.</p>
<p>10. Unite reclamation, agricultural, and construction companies to engage in land reclamation, planting, and housing construction in the evacuation areas.</p>
<p>11. Recruit unemployed laborers in Shanghai to engage in land reclamation and evacuation undertakings.</p>
<p>12. The government authorities should unite with the hometown associations to provide financial assistance to those who cannot afford to return home.</p>
<p>The above twelve methods are the most basic and easy to implement methods for evacuation. If the authorities are determined to implement them, then the evacuation problem will be easily solved.</p>
<h3 id="e37">The Importance and Methods of Evacuating Schools <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Shinting</p>
<p>Newspapers have been publishing exhortations to evacuate the population for months now. However, citizens have been slow to move, with very few complying. The reasons are no more than the following three: 1. Rural life is not as comfortable as in Shanghai. 2. Lack of money, difficult travel, or no means of making a living after evacuation. 3. Children are studying in Shanghai, and evacuation would interrupt their studies, hence the hesitation. Furthermore, the population of Shanghai is very large, so why worry? They console themselves. However, this is no longer the case. The environment makes it impossible for us to stay any longer, so the first reason or excuse no longer exists, and the second reason is being overcome; as for what is not easy to overcome, it is really the third reason.</p>
<p>If schools are not evacuated, most students will not dare to leave without permission, and if students do not dare to leave without permission, their families will certainly not leave Shanghai, so it is difficult to achieve the goal of evacuating the population. If schools can be evacuated, then students will certainly have no intention of being unruly, and students' families will certainly make plans to return to their hometowns, and the goal of evacuating the population will be easily achieved. Therefore, evacuating schools is the most urgent and important issue today, and should be evacuated before other groups.</p>
<p>The general public's view is that evacuating schools is impossible in reality: how to move school buildings, school equipment, teachers, students, and the families of teachers and students? The enormous cost is more than ten million? It is practically impossible to move, so it has not been evacuated to this day.</p>
<p>But this is wrong! The method of evacuating schools is not like this. In other words, evacuating schools is simply "dissolving Shanghai schools and establishing rural schools." The schools in Shanghai should be declared dissolved as soon as possible to strengthen the determination of students and their families to return to their hometowns, and to issue appropriate funds so that teachers can take their families back to their hometowns or choose a place to evacuate. When they arrive in the countryside, they can rent temples, churches, and the remaining houses of large families to open small-scale schools, following the old-fashioned style while implementing the new education system. The education authorities can send inspectors to travel between villages and towns to be responsible for guidance; when the time is right, implement examinations, and issue certificates to those who pass, so as not to waste the time of evacuation.</p>
<p>School work should start with the municipal education bureau, with municipal schools setting an example and taking the lead, and private schools will certainly follow suit. If this can be done, not only will students and their families be able to evacuate with peace of mind, but the backward rural areas can also be rid of the stale air of the new education. In other words, the level of Chinese culture will be "revived" as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Provisional Regulations for the Management of Piers <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>It is noted that the existing Regulations for the Management of Piers in this city were drafted by the former Bureau of Public Works in July of the 31st year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1942] and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. It has come to our attention that the Municipal Government believes these regulations, having been in use for three years, are largely inconsistent with the current situation. Since the former Bureau of Public Works was dissolved and its duties transferred to the Bureau of Construction, the management of piers has been handled by the Bureau of Construction. Therefore, the functions and powers stipulated in the original regulations need to be revised to adapt to current needs. The revised Provisional Regulations for the Management of Piers of the Shanghai Special Municipality are hereby promulgated and appended below:</p>
<p>Chapter 1: General Provisions</p>
<p>Article 1: The Shanghai Special Municipal Government enacts these provisional regulations to manage the piers within the city limits.</p>
<p>Article 2: All piers within this Special Municipality, whether publicly owned, municipally owned, self-built, or leased, shall have their ownership and future disposition rights wholly vested in the municipality. Their management shall be conducted entirely in accordance with these regulations.</p>
<p>Article 3: Piers that have already been self-built or leased before the promulgation of these regulations must uniformly complete the procedures in accordance with these regulations and apply to the Bureau of Construction for registration.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Self-Built Piers</p>
<p>Article 4: Anyone intending to self-build a pier along a river or the Jiang [Yangtze River] within this Special Municipality must proceed according to the Regulations for Citizens of this City Requesting the Construction of Roads, Bridges, Piers, and Embankments, and comply with the provisions of these regulations. They must also submit a detailed list of the following items to the Bureau of Construction for dispatching personnel to inspect and approve before construction can begin:</p>
<p>(1) Name of the owner or company; (2) License for using the shoreline; (3) Stone construction drawings; (4) Purpose of the pier.</p>
<p>Article 5: Once the Bureau of Construction approves the reported self-built pier, it will issue a pier license, the form of which will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Article 6: Upon completion of the pier construction, the Bureau of Construction should be notified to dispatch personnel for inspection. If the construction does not conform to the approved drawings, the Bureau of Construction may order its reconstruction.</p>
<p>Article 7: The materials used for the pier construction must be durable. If a fixed pier is built for the purpose of allowing ships to dock for passenger and cargo embarkation and disembarkation, its pilings, steps, and supports should be made of reinforced concrete. The pier surface must not exceed the road surface.</p>
<p>Article 8: If there are any changes in the pier operation, or if damage occurs or circumstances arise that could easily lead to danger, it should be reported to the authorities for handling immediately. Otherwise, in addition to forfeiting the deposit, the license will be revoked.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Leased Piers</p>
<p>Article 9: Municipal piers, except those used by the competent authority, may be leased periodically by various shipping companies according to the following procedures.</p>
<p>Article 10: To lease a municipal pier periodically, a written application should be submitted requesting the Bureau of Construction to approve the location and lease term, and a contract should be signed. However, the lease term shall not exceed five years. Upon expiration, if the Municipal Government does not reclaim it for its own use, an application may be made for continued lease.</p>
<p>Article 11: Lessees of municipal piers shall pay rent according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>Pier Use: (Category A) Loading and unloading passengers and cargo; (Category B) Loading and unloading cargo</p>
<p>Annual Rent: (A) 28,800; (B) 19,200; Four-Year Rent: (A) 92,160; (B) 61,440</p>
<p>Two-Year Rent: 55,440; 33,440; Five-Year Rent: 100,800; 867,200</p>
<p>Three-Year Rent: 77,760; 51,840</p>
<p>The rent amounts listed above are calculated per meter. Any fraction less than one meter should be counted as one meter.</p>
<p>Article 12: After the lease contract for a municipal pier is signed, the lessee shall prepay one year's rent and a deposit to the Bureau of Construction. The deposit shall be equal to one year's rent.</p>
<p>Article 13: Upon expiration of the approved lease term, if the lessee does not apply for continued lease, the deposit paid should be refunded in full.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Pier Berthing</p>
<p>Article 14: Ships berthing at piers, except for shipping companies that have entered into a lease contract, shall pay berthing fees.</p>
<p>Article 15: If a ship intends to berth at a municipal pier, it shall complete a berthing request form three hours in advance and submit it to the Pier Management Office of the Bureau of Construction for approval. Only after a berthing assignment slip is issued may the ship berth at the assigned pier. The berthing fee shall be paid to the Pier Management Office of the Bureau of Construction in accordance with the regulations. The regulations on berthing fees shall be determined separately.</p>
<p>Article 16: Public vessels of various government agencies berthing at municipal piers for official business may be exempt from berthing fees upon verification and permission by the Pier Management Office of the Bureau of Construction, but the berthing time shall not exceed two hours.</p>
<p>Article 17: Ships berthing at piers shall not, except under special circumstances, exceed the position of their assigned pier, thereby obstructing the berthing of other companies' ships.</p>
<p>Article 18: If a ship berthing at a municipal pier damages the pier or its auxiliary facilities, the shipping company shall be responsible for compensation and repair.</p>
<p>Article 19: Matters concerning mooring and unmooring of ships berthing at piers shall be handled by personnel dispatched by the Pier Management Office of the Bureau of Construction. Crew members shall not berth or move lines without authorization.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: General Management Rules</p>
<p>Article 20: Companies operating shipping businesses shall report the following circumstances to the competent authority for handling, regardless of whether the pier is self-built, leased, or used for berthing:</p>
<p>(1) When public security and order on the pier are disrupted. (2) When illegal smuggling of contraband is discovered. (3) When reactionary elements endangering the country and society infiltrate or escape.</p>
<p>Article 21: All shipping company personnel, outdoor staff, and stevedores on the piers shall wear uniforms prescribed by the Bureau of Construction and shall be subject to the direction of the personnel of the Pier Management Office of the Bureau of Construction.</p>
<p>Article 22: Passengers embarking and disembarking, and cargo being loaded and unloaded, on the pier shall enter and exit according to the entrance and exit signs of the Bureau of Construction.</p>
<p>Article 23: Shipping companies shall not arbitrarily pile up goods near the pier, nor shall they dump garbage, coal slag, bricks, mud, or waste into the water.</p>
<p>Article 24: Goods are not allowed to be piled up on floating piers and floating bridges.</p>
<p>Article 25: Commercial vehicles, unless hired, are not allowed to remain within the pier area.</p>
