<h3 id="c4">浦東南區近況 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 熙</p>
<p>浦東南區位處市區東部，自外灘十三號碼頭至浦東東昌路約每四十分鐘有市輪渡來往一次，每次乘價五十五元，此外更有小划可搭，價錢也一樣，唯次數頗多，幾每三·五分鐘魷有一次。公路有上南綫，大奉綫及周家渡至周浦綫等，每日皆能按期開行，故尚稱便利。浦東南區管轄六鎭二十鄉，大概可分爲南·北·中三大部，其北部及沿江一帶爲工業區，中部東昌路爲商業區，南部則爲農業區，其居民約有三十餘萬人。</p>
<p>物價與市區不相上下</p>
<p>浦東南區地近上海市區，故生活必需品之價格，與浦西幾乎完全相同。米的來源以從南匯輸入爲主，不過有時交通遭受封鎖，來源斷絕，則在價格高漲情形之下，浦西米阪就紛紛負米渡江東來以求厚利，如浦西米價較昂時則反是，（如最近浦東米價十萬元，而浦西則僅九萬元的情形也曾有過。）然變化莫測，實無法捉摸與把握的。菜蔬等雖爲浦東所出產，但因全數被大商販包去，成批大量地運到浦西市塲，故出產地的浦東反要到浦西零批再運回售與吃戶。柴·油等物多數是由崇明。啓東及江北等地運來，也都是先到浦西，再轉運來此，故價亦不廉。肉類及家禽蛋類價也一樣，由於人口的衆多，現該地已有人滿之患，工塲區工人及苦力來去極爲頻繁，幾無隙地，農民屋舍多是自建自居，極少出租，故覓屋之難竟較市區爲尤甚。廟宇有「欽賜仰殿」，在十八間鎭，係道士所有，規模不大，不過香火倒很盛，往年每逢三月出會，鄰區各地來觀看者極多，現在久不舉行，往昔盛況，只能供回想罷了。另有張家祠堂一所，亦僅敷橡而已。</p>
<p>去冬嚴寒蔬菜大受損害</p>
<p>該區主要農產品爲蔬菜，幾乎整個上海市區蔬菜的需要全數爲浦東所供給，由此我們可以推知其產量豐富之一般。一年四季不論什末菜，這兒都有出產，現在所產的就有黃椰菜，　菜，菠菜，　棵菜，小湯菜，菲菜黃，　　匆等，他的栽種總面積約四萬畝。去年冬天因爲特別嚴寒的天氣，和屢次降落大雪，致使菜類大受損害，爲了這，現在我們在小菜塲上除了看見菠菜一種外，幾乎其他的菜蔬我們很少看到。在前些日子青菜的價格所以升漲到比肉類還要貴些，這情形是天災造成的，並不是人爲的。據一位熟悉這方面情形者的精確估計，去年冬季因受嚴寒氣候的影響，那些終年辛勞的菜蔬栽培者，至少在他們的每畝地上要損失八萬元的收入。這樣僅僅一個浦東南區就要損失了三十二萬萬元，這是多末龐大的數字，這不僅是農民的損失，這也是地方的損失。</p>
<p>農工商及敎育情況</p>
<p>該區農戶以自耕農較多，約佔百分之八十；佃農較少，僅佔百分之二十五，正因如此，所以農民彼此的感情也還很融洽。關於高利貸的情形是有的，不過都是小宗而且不公開的，最近普通的利率已達到月息百分之四十五到百分之五十·地價因爲地區的繁榮與荒凉不同，價格也魷跟着有極大的差異，一般價格是從最低二萬元一畝到最高七十萬一畝，不過這還是去年年底的調查，今年自然比這數目還要提高許多。商業以東昌路爲最繁盛，商店林立，是精華所在，敎育方面有市立三林中學，在事變前規模極爲宏大，私立中學有竣德，洋涇等三所，市立小學有十五所，私立小學有三十餘處，數目雖算不少，不過和人口總數比皎起來，仍然相差很遠。學校收費數額，較市區略便宜些，這是因爲該地學生多爲貧苦子弟，是不得不如此的。</p>
<p>新成立海軍保甲區</p>
<p>在行政方面，該地由浦東南區公署管轄，直屬市府，現任署長爲朱玉軫氏，治安方面有保安警察隊第二，三大隊駐於該區，唯常有調動，所以無確定數目，其他有水上警察，自警團等，最後值得一提的就是本年三月一日起，浦東沿江一帶新近成立了海軍保甲區。</p>

<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據克利夫倫電：美國地上部隊司令官史蒂威爾，七日於兵器製造業者公會席上講演，旋與出席者作問答式談話。對日軍於中國大陸形勢大略之情形，答稱如次：日軍駐中國之師團爲數甚多，且每師團之兵力亦極優越，將來與日軍之最精銳部隊遭遇，恐在滿洲戰塲。</p>
<h3 id="c8">日新政事結社　創立籌備會　定八日下午舉行 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日本新政事結社之第一次創立籌備會，原定七日舉行，因故改於八日下午二時，在議會召開，籌備人共計四四四各，內中有貴族院一四一名，衆議院一七四名，各界一二九名，是日會議終了後，預定在小磯首相官邸舉行懇談，該籌備會爲期從速結成政社及銓衡黨首，規定宣言綱領，組織機構等，決定先組織小組委員會。該結社之首倡者小林躋造氏，已於二日對貴，眾兩院議員，翼贊會關係者及中英地方知各之士約三千名發出請柬，要求贊同及協力。</p>
<h3 id="c9">日人力物力充沛　時間對日更有利　——格魯力言美國作戰困難—— <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據紐約來電稱，美國務次官格魯一日出席於紐約召開之外國新聞協會時，曾呼號澈底擊破日本，同時並力言對日作戰之困難如次：自三年前由東京歸國以來，余曾將日本戰力之强大及日本將兵之可畏，一再傳達於國民。戰至今日，美國民當已充份認識日本爲如何性質之強敵。</p>
<p>日軍具有特殊信念</p>
<p>達拉瓦作戰美軍已洞曉日軍乃一有特殊信念之軍隊，馬尼刺作戰亦使美國民得到同樣之教訓，而此次之硫黃島作戰，美軍損害甚大之原因，乃日軍戰力執拗奮戰之結果也。今日之日本扼有東亞最大商路，而此地域於事實上又爲世界之隔離部份，日本已建設國茲於此資源極大之地域，此等資源在平時世界經濟上，亦爲不可或能之條件，例如天然橡皮一項，日本所配之產額，佔全世界百分之九十四，美國正苦於橡皮不足之今日，日本仍獲得充份使用貴重之橡膠，此外椰子之產額，實佔百分之八十三，然而反軸心軍作戰之進展，却使日軍漸次不易利用此等資源，觀於美軍雖已迫近距東京僅七百公里之日本大門硫黃島，然而美軍並戰力尚未到達使日軍戰力衰弱之地步。</p>
<p>軍器物資繼續增產</p>
<p>日本仍得繼續增產飛機，戰車，裝甲車與其他軍器，即使美軍封鎖台灣以南，日本之重要物資如煤炭，鉛鐵及食糧等，仍可自給自足，日本之電力豐富，生產價又低廉，且日本又蓄有與長期作戰最關重要之航空汽油，以刻下情形觀之，美軍補給綫逐漸擴展，而日軍則逐漸縮短，日本之人口資源，亦甚豐厚，日本雖已動員數百萬兵力，然尚有立時可動員之壯丁數百萬。此外，尚有十七歲至二十歲之男子數百萬名，且日本每年增加新壯丁極衆，前綫日軍損失，不及其可充之數，美若不充分理解此等事實，則不能把握日本之眞性格。</p>
<p>美國船長大感不足</p>
<p>美國於太平洋作戰，船隻不足，此船隻不足問題，雖自開戰以來所發生者，但今後亦決不能解決，反軸心軍作戰之最大困難，乃爲輸送工具之不足，尤以太平洋作戰爲甚，此種輸送工具之不足，以時間及距離計算，則對日作戰所需船隻，爲對德作戰所需之三倍。硫黃島在地圖上，不過佔一小點，然而美軍登陸時所動員之船舶噸數，實際比北法登陸時所用者爲多，茲舉一例觀之，前呂宋島登陸美軍兵力約十萬，其補給所需船舶在最初三十日間爲百六十萬噸，今後縱不增加兵力，其後三十日間，亦需船舶六十萬噸，故美國於呂宋開始上陸二月後，需要船舶二百二十萬噸。</p>
<p>呼號採取攻勢作戰</p>
<p>硫磺島約有敵海軍四百登陸，在最初一月間，需船六十四萬噸，其次一月間，需二十四萬噸，二月合計共需八十八萬噸，如此美國僅此二島作戰，在最初六十日間，亦非動員船舶三百八萬噸不可，此數計佔反軸心國所有船舶總量五千萬噸中之百分之六，太平洋攻勢作戰之速度與困難，日益增加，則所需船舶量亦隨之增加也。日本不僅準備十年戰爭，且準備百年戰爭，於日本最有利者，乃爲時間，日本欲爭取時問，以利用其支配下之廣大資源，吾人爲打破日本此種計劃，必須在太平洋與歐洲同時採取攻勢。</p>
<p>來栖大使　公子陣亡</p>

<p>中央社電廣州訊據可靠方面消息：英美最近常以歐洲戰局將近結束，或以戰後處理方案爲幌子，吸引各小國家，但各小國家果能受其恩惠乎？蓋各小國受英美蘇外安手段之恐嚇與經濟壓迫屈服於英美，其所受政治上經濟上及社會上的一切痛苦，比較上次大戰時更爲深切。英美屢次犧牲各小國以擴充戰後勢力，彼等所奉爲金科玉律之大西洋憲章，亦爲彼等自加殘踏，此係盎格魯撒克遜民族之故技，固不值驚奇者。據路透社巴黎特派員合維斯傳稱：巴黎之四百萬市民飢寒交迫，計自英美侵入法本國後，民房遭破壞者六十萬戶，鐵路損失一八〇七五英里，鐵路車輛十七萬輛，汽車三萬二千輛，如欲恢復戰前生產力，須需時六年，英美唯求對德作戰，置法人生活於不顧，於此可見一斑。又如義大利巴特里奧投降英美後，彼等當可從桎梏中解放，然事實上又如何？於政治外交上言，已成爲英美蘇勢力之角逐塲，在英美佔領下之南義大利，與前次大戰時同樣情形，失業飢饉，犯罪賣淫，隨處可見，據路透社電報：乳幼兒中百分之九十五以營養不良而致死亡。再如比利時，該國人民今在英美之所謂解放下，每日憧憬往日德國統治時代之幸福，據里斯本電：比外長曾飛往倫敦，就食糧問題與英國折衝，惟比利時之食糧恐慌，日益嚴重，國外援助不能寄與期待，以上僅舉其二三例而已。此外，希臘之內亂，保加利亞之暴動波蘭之內江，捷克斯洛伐克之被宰割等，無一不爲英美野心之表現，英國現正積極保持戰前之舊勢力，美國則盡最大努力，企圖插足於歐洲英美蘇勢力地區，處於中間之各小國，莫不受其茶毒。美國之企圖在中國大陸登陸，其情形與歐洲各弱小國家相同，目的在犧牲中國，使人民徒受其苦是已不言可喻矣。</p>

<h3 id="c15">「公益重於私利」 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>周市長前在吿市民書中說過：「公益重於私利，社會先於個人。」這兩句話，原是每一個國民所應奉行的，尤其是我們中國的國民，上海社會的市民，在此國家多故社會動機之時，更應竭力奉行的。可是，上海社會的一般人雖然在這樣的環境裏，却依然漠視這兩句話的意義。譬如關於本市冬賑經費以及軍警贈金兩事，冬賑已將結束，軍警贈金已經獻贈，照理不必再提了，爲什麼我們今天重複提出呢？因爲冬賑經費及軍警贈金已在上月七日由市民福利協會邀集各業公會即席分別攤派，並由該會及市商會聯名分別催繳，可是，直到現在各公會所繳到者僅及四分之一，歷時經月爲數僅一萬萬元，而拖延到今天，猶復觀望，致使商統會及各銀行等墊借之款未能歸還。這點很足以反映上海社會一般有力份子漠視社會公益的態度。</p>
<p>因爲大多數人先私後公，甚至只私無公，所以，國家社會演變至如此衰頽的地步，爲人輕視。有利之事，大家趨之若驚，爭先唯恐不及，而公益之事，大家避之若凂，推諉唯恐不力，如果每個人尤其是社會有力份子，不能變革這種觀念，那末，社會崩潰，國家滅亡是無可避免的。</p>
<p>國家的事業，山國家領袖領導辦理，人民必須服從協力，社會的事業，由社會領袖領導辦理，社會人士也須服從協力。譬如上海市民福利協會理事長聞蘭亭先生，市政諮詢委員會主席委員李思浩先生，市商會理事長袁履登先生，銀行公會秘書長林康侯先生等，大家公認爲社會領袖，他們對於公利公益，總是站在前機領導，整個時間爲社會公利公益服務，所以，我們大家對於他們所領導的事應該遵從協力的。這次派定冬賑經費軍警贈金，他們都熱忱考虛，所以，派定以後，絕不應有討價還價的事，更不應有存心延宕的事，否則何貴乎有社會領袖，而社會事業無人領導，更將演變至怎樣地步呢？</p>
<p>過去上海每有社會公益事業舉辦，最爲感慨的現象，一般有力份子對於公益事業的集會，總是推託不到，如頭出錢者更加推諉事業不利，或一味嘆窮，規避責任。尤於這次募集冬賑經費及軍警贈金兩事中暴露無遺。譬如昨天由各領袖邀請派定未繳各業負責人茶會，被邀者百餘人中僅到不足二十人。他們都以爲只須個人事業發達，暴利可求，就可關起門來盡情享受，社會領袖的話可以不聽，社會輿論可以不理。他們並未想到，如果整個社會不安寗時，怎樣可以保得個人安全？整個國家不能生存時，更怎樣可以單獨生存呢？</p>
<p>上海各大同業公會，在公會的本身，經濟能力固然不大的，可是，公會會員之中就很多富有的，如果社會領袖爲社會公益事業而指派擔任經費，公會理事長即應考慮會員力量，運用職權，公平分派，何致有討價還價的事。譬如冬賑反軍警贈金中指派新聞協會上海區分會二百萬元，我以區分會理事長的炎格接受了，於三天之內就如數繳淸。論新聞同業的單位，則中國同業僅六家報紙；諭經濟力量，則新中兩報於舊曆年底均借債發薪，其餘同業更爲困難；然而因爲是社會的公益事業，不能不勉强擔任，因爲是社會領袖的命令，不能不服從。至於同業關係，則中華日報是我們的領袖報紙，論資格則新聞報社長李思浩先生是我們的前輩，可是，我是區分會的理事長，就運用職權分派，只須公平合理，自無問題。其他如銀行業，錢業，紗廠業，麵粉業等各同業公會，無不如期如數迅速繳款，也無非爲了重視公益。</p>
<p>至於向個人方面募捐者，我曾向盛幼　先生啓口二百萬元，欣然允諾，又向羅洪義張瑞棠徐長春三先生啟口三百萬元，他們或自捐或經募，都如數迅速交清。我爲了公益事業，就能很率直的逢人啓口，而他們也都爲了重視公益，毅然應允。</p>
<p>目前時局緊急日甚，國家應做的事業，社會應做的公益，正是方興未艾，冬賑及軍警贈金僅是細微的一端而已。不久市府將發行庫券十五萬萬元，民間至少認募五萬萬元。在上海有事業有財產有力量者，都應踴躍認募。至於冬賑及軍警贈金，已派定而尚未繳款者限於本月二十日以前繳齊，希望重視公益，儘先繳淸。最近傳聞某業鉅商逃出上海避往異邦，可是，他的不動產是沒法移動的，試問他將來是否再想回來？又某公會理事長，因爲取巧囤積，被當局拘捕扣押。前者爲衆人鄙棄，後者落塲又如此，凡此均足爲只顧私利不顧公益者的殷鑑，可不愼之！</p>

<p>國府宣傳部以當此大東亞戰爭決戰階段，思想戰更形銳化之際，中央電訊社所負使命，愈益重大。爰特將中央電訊社改組爲公益社團法人，以代表國家民族之立塲，及以國內報業之全體爲對象，成爲中華民國全國性之新聞電訊機關，茲以籌備手續就緒，乃於昨（五）日下午三時，假南京路外灘華懋飯店八樓舉行首次理事會議，宣傳部趙部長尊嶽特躬蒞主持，茲分誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>會議情形　中央社首次理事會議，計到有趙宣傳部長，曁陳彬龢·許力求·陳日平·金雄白·袁殊（鄭介代）·魯風·鞠淸遠·蔣雲章及郭社長秀峯等。由趙部長主席致詞，報吿中央社改組爲公益社團法人之意義及今後之使命（詞另錄）。繼由社長郭秀峯報吿一年來處理社務之經過，就確立財政，改善機構，養成人材，强化通訊各點，闡述頗詳，並希望中央社改組之後，能發揮中央社爲國家通訊社之本有使命，具各報取得更緊　之關係，完成新時代之使命。並謂中央社改組旣有結果，希望乘此卸去仔肩等語。旋即開始討論事項如下：</p>
<p>（一）主席交議：中央電訊社章程草案案（決議修正通過）。</p>
<p>（二）主席交議；中央電訊總分社新組織機構案（決議修正通過）。</p>
<p>（三）主席交議：中央電訊社社員入社金案（決議修正通過）。</p>
<p>（四）推選理事長案（決議公推趙部長擔任理事長）。</p>
<p>（五）公推郭秀峯繼續擔任社長職務，郭氏當即表示謙亂，謂中央社改組旣有結果，本人希望乘此機會卸去仔肩。旋經決議：中央社社長問題關係重大，應調示中樞意見，請趙理長歸京後銓衡決定，不必再經理事會決議。在人選未確定以前，請郭社長暫行維持社務。</p>
<p>（六）主席交議，中央電訊社三十四年三月至六月每月收支槪算案，（決議經常費照原提案通過，其籌集辦法由常務理事會決定之，至於特別預算，則由常務理事會籌集之）。</p>
<p>（七）縮減人事節省經費案，（決議由社長秉承理事長辦理之）。（餘案從略）。</p>
<p>直至下午五時半始吿散會。下午六時半，趙部長特似金門飯店歡宴全體出席理事，席間對中央社今後之發展及改進事項相互發表意見，至八時半始盡歡而散。</p>
<p>趙部長詞　趙部長致詞云：中央電訊社社爲國家唯一之新聞電訊宣傳報道機關，事變以前，即有中央通訊社之設立，迨至事變以後，國府還都，當時即首將在上海之中華通訊社，與在南京之中華聯合通訊社合併，改組爲中央電訊社，使成爲一全國性質之新聞電訊機關。在前宣傳部長督導及歷任社長經營管理之下，爲艱巨之和平建國運動，担負宣傳報道之重大使命，對於和平國策之闡揚，大東亞戰爭之宣傳以及反動宣傳之關正，盡其最大努力，慘淡經營，迄今已有五年光輝歷史。其間因隨時局之開展與時代之演變，雖歷盡挫折艱難，但肩負着統一性之全國電訊事業，正確報道，有重大使命之中央電訊社始終屹然卓立，艱苦奮鬥，以保有今日之成果。</p>
<p>新聞電訊事業，不僅爲文化事業之重要部份，亦爲完成革命建設爭取國家民族獨立生存之主要工作，時局每進至一新的階段，則新聞電訊事業亦隨而益加重其使命，尤其現富大東亞戰爭決戰時期，思想戰吏形銳化。過去中央電訊社爲本部所管轄之附屬事業機關，現爲加强其組織，改成爲獨立的社團法人，使與全國報業取得更進一步緊密之聯系，一方面應確覺本身立場乃國家對內對外唯一全國性質之新聞電訊機關，闡揚國策，發佈政聞，發揮國家代表通訊社之性格，是其重大任務。一方面是以全國報業爲單位，而共同組織之公益社團，溝通各地消息，供給電訊新聞，是其唯一職責。總之，中央電訊社之立塲，應爲代表國家民族的，中央電訊社之對象，應爲國內報業全體的，是爲此次改組中央電訊社之重大意義。中央電訊社經此次改組以後，與以前僅爲政府附屬之事業機關，性質雖有不同，然政府仍居於指導之地位，俾全國一體共謀發展，以完成中央電訊社對時代之新使命。</p>

<p>「我是個不幸的孩子，我家本住在南陽橋，家中經濟狀况也還寬裕。那時我在黃河路喇格納小學攻讀，事變以後，父親失業，而且物價在漲，生活不易，後來我父親在南京謀到了職業，便離開了上海，遷居到南京。我的學業從此便中止了，在南京住了有一年多，想不到在去年六月裏，却發生了意外的事，因爲我的父親所賺的薪水非常之少，家中不够開支，所以設法帶些本錢，到上海來做生意。誰知到了上海，音信全無，我和母親非常焦急，不知他生死如何，便在南京將所有的家具，典了些錢做盤費，趕到上海。想不到我父親在滬，把南京所帶來的本錢，一賭而盡，我母子兩人趕到上海，他已經是一貧如洗，無法可想便流落街頭。不料禍不單行，我父母雙親又得了痢疾，就此與世長辭，留下了我一人，舉目無親，孤苦伶仃，就在永壽街附近，搭了一個小草棚，每天出去抬些紙頭破布，以維持自己的生活。過了一個多月，對面陳聚典鉛絲店內有一位吳經詒老先生，他是非常熱心，看見我可憐，托貴報館設法把我介紹到南市董家渡福幼院，一天二粥一飯，並承敎師們熱心指導，秩序和整潔都好，規律也嚴，眞是苦兒的天堂。爲此要謝謝貴報和吳先生的介紹。孤兒沈社德敬上。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Troops on Iwo Jima Fight Bravely to Annihilate the Enemy; Fierce Battles Northwest of Mt. Iwo; Two Soldiers Awarded Citations and Announcement Made to the Entire Army <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy forces on Iwo Jima, having broken through the island's center from the direction of Motoyama Airfield, attacked the northern airfield on the evening of the 2nd. At this time, the Japanese garrison immediately concentrated artillery fire, launching a fierce barrage and simultaneously attacking from the east, west, and north, causing a large part of the enemy force to collapse. Around 2:00 PM on the 3rd, approximately 600 enemy soldiers advanced to the vicinity of the northern villages. A portion of them, under intense Japanese fire, infiltrated the northern bridge of the northern airfield. By dusk on the 3rd, the main force of the enemy on the western front had reached the western villages between the northern villages and Mt. Osaka.</p>
<p>From Megane Rock to Sankenya, around 11:00 AM on the 4th, the enemy, with over ten tanks and approximately one thousand infantry, attempted to forcefully assault the Japanese position about 700 meters northwest of Sankenya. A bloody battle ensued. Currently, fighting remains intense in the areas of the Aso village north of Mt. Iwo and the Motoyama village. On the morning of the 3rd, Japanese troops in that area ambushed approximately 600 enemy soldiers equipped with four tanks on the eastern side of Aso village, and fiercely attacked the enemy forces approaching the vicinity of Motoyama village, immobilizing one of their tanks and driving them back. On the southern front, around Mt. Iwo, there were no changes on the afternoon of the 2nd. However, by noon on the 3rd, approximately one hundred enemy infantry, under the cover of four tanks, launched a flame attack on the Japanese position, but were immediately repelled. Around 2:00 PM that afternoon, the enemy again attacked the north and northwest of Mt. Iwo with over ten tanks and over eight hundred infantry. Japanese troops in that area are currently engaged in a fierce battle with them.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison troops in the Mt. Osaka area of Iwo Jima are continuing their brave counterattacks. The gains achieved include two tanks immobilized and destroyed by fire, and 450 enemy soldiers killed. Among them, soldiers Chayen and Kaneko bravely killed over forty enemy soldiers and then urgently cooperated to capture one automatic rifle and three light machine guns, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. The meritorious deeds of these two soldiers were recognized on that day by Commander Kuribayashi, who awarded them letters of appreciation and announced it to the entire army. Furthermore, the Japanese engineer suicide squad, which infiltrated the enemy's geothermal area from the Mt. Osaka area several days ago, had killed or wounded a total of thirty enemy soldiers by the night of the 2nd, and safely returned to the Japanese position on the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Aircraft in Large Combined Formations Bomb Enemy Bases in India and Burma; Enemy Advance South Between Nanzin and Sinbo Blocked <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Burma Frontline Base, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force combat-bomber combined formations in Burma launched a large-scale operation before dawn on the 4th, carrying out heavy bombing of enemy forward bases in central and southern Burma and air bases in eastern India. The Japanese Air Force attacked enemy airfields at Shwebo, Thaungdut, Kalemyo, Akyab, Kyaukse, and Cox's Bazar, heavily bombing aircraft parked on the ground, hangars, and other facilities, achieving the following comprehensive results: A. Enemy Damage: (1) 27 or more aircraft destroyed, 15 or more damaged, 1 shot down, totaling 43 or more aircraft. (2) One large explosion. (3) Dozens of cars destroyed or damaged. (4) Further results of destroyed aircraft and ground facilities are unknown due to poor weather. B. Japanese Losses: One aircraft unreturned.</p>
<p>Burma Frontline, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy 50th Division advancing southward from the west of Nansan is gradually approaching the vicinity of Nanzin from the north and west. A portion of them is also advancing southward from Sinbo. Powerful Japanese forces in the Nanxiang area are firmly defending the positions in that area and continuing to fiercely attack the enemy forces between Nanzin and Sinbo, thereby blocking their southward advance. The enemy near Meiktila south of Mandalay has, since February 28th, occupied the Ouma and Tatkon airfields, approximately 15 kilometers northeast of the area, with a force of forty tanks and two infantry battalions. On the 2nd of this month, Japanese aircraft formations launched a fierce attack on these airfields, bombing and destroying ground facilities. Japanese troops west of Mandalay have been fiercely attacking approximately 1,300 enemy soldiers equipped with over ten tanks near Nugaung since the 26th, and fierce fighting is ongoing.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – The United States has suffered significant sacrifices in the operation to open the China-India transport route and in the construction and maintenance of the highway. According to a Washington dispatch, the State Department issued the following statement on the 4th: "Every mile along the Ledo Road has a cemetery. Currently, sixty-five out of every one hundred participants in this highway mission are black soldiers, who are now struggling against mud, rain, and malaria." This is further evidence that the enemy US is using black people as sacrifices.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Elite Japanese Troops in Luzon Launch Full-Scale Assault; Japanese Air Force Heavily Attacks Enemy Airfields <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Luzon Frontline, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's attempts to break through the Kalabali area are still not to be underestimated. Japanese troops defending the Pengkeng area, 15 kilometers north of San Jose, have been ambushing an enemy division 30 kilometers south of that location since the 27th. Furthermore, Japanese units north of Caranglan are also engaged in combat with approximately 500 enemy soldiers possessing four artillery pieces. The enemy attacking the high ground northeast of Manila is being blocked by fierce Japanese assaults and intense artillery fire. Since the 27th, the enemy's attacks have been stalled. Although enemy shelling has subsided, Japanese soldiers, reinforced by elite units, are in even higher spirits and are carrying out full-scale assaults on the enemy, destroying their preparations for further attacks. Japanese units near Montalban launched a fierce attack on enemy forces entering the vicinity of the Japanese position, inflicting annihilating blows.</p>
<p>Luzon Island Frontline, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese troops in the old city of Manila have had their communication lines cut off since the 26th, but a portion of the Japanese troops is still fiercely resisting. On the 4th, enemy artillery shelling of the city was extremely intense.</p>
<p>Luzon Frontline, 5th (Central News Agency) – From 1:30 PM on the 2nd, Japanese Air Force units heavily attacked the San Fabian enemy airfield for an hour, repeatedly conducting machine gun strafing runs. The results confirmed by Japanese reconnaissance aircraft include over thirty enemy aircraft destroyed and burned, and three locations burned. In addition, significant damage was inflicted on their material and ammunition stockpiles.</p>
<p>Suburban Communication</p>
<h3 id="e4">Recent Situation in the Southern District of Pudong <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Hee</p>
<p>The southern district of Pudong is located in the eastern part of the city. There is a city ferry service from the Bund No. 13 pier to Dongchang Road in Pudong about every forty minutes, costing 55 yuan per trip. In addition, there are small boats available, also costing the same price, but running more frequently, about every three to five minutes. There are bus routes such as the Shangnan Line, the Dafeng Line, and the Zhoujiadu to Zhoupu Line, which operate on schedule daily, making transportation relatively convenient. The southern district of Pudong governs six towns and twenty villages, which can be roughly divided into three major parts: south, north, and central. The northern part and the area along the river are industrial areas, Dongchang Road in the central part is a commercial area, and the southern part is an agricultural area. The population is approximately 300,000.</p>
<p>Prices Are Comparable to the City</p>
<p>The southern district of Pudong is close to the urban area of Shanghai, so the prices of essential goods are almost exactly the same as in Puxi. The main source of rice is imports from Nanhui, but sometimes when transportation is blocked and the supply is cut off, Puxi rice merchants rush to cross the river to the east to seek high profits when prices rise. The reverse is also true when rice prices are higher in Puxi (as recently as when rice prices in Pudong were 100,000 yuan, while they were only 90,000 yuan in Puxi). However, changes are unpredictable and impossible to grasp or control. Although vegetables are produced in Pudong, they are all contracted out to large wholesalers who transport them in large quantities to the Puxi markets. Therefore, Pudong, the place of production, has to rely on Puxi for wholesale and then transport them back to sell to consumers. Firewood, oil, and other items are mostly transported from Chongming, Qidong, and Jiangbei, but they all go to Puxi first and then are transported here, so the prices are not cheap. The prices of meat and poultry and eggs are the same. Due to the large population, the area is now suffering from overcrowding. Workers and coolies in the factory areas come and go very frequently, leaving almost no vacant land. Most farmers build and live in their own houses, rarely renting them out, so finding a house is even more difficult than in the city. There is the "Imperial Gift Yangdian" temple in Shibajian Town, owned by Taoists. It is not large in scale, but the incense is very prosperous. In previous years, there would be a temple fair every March, with many people from neighboring areas coming to watch. Now it has not been held for a long time, and the grand occasion of the past can only be reminisced about. There is also the Zhang Family Ancestral Hall, which is only barely adequate.</p>
<p>Severe Cold Last Winter Greatly Damaged Vegetables</p>
<p>The main agricultural product of the area is vegetables. Almost all of Shanghai's vegetable needs are supplied by Pudong, from which we can infer the general abundance of its production. All kinds of vegetables are produced here in all seasons. The vegetables currently produced include cabbage, lettuce, spinach, mustard greens, small soup greens, garlic chives, scallions, etc. The total planting area is about 40,000 mu. Last winter, due to particularly severe weather and repeated heavy snowfalls, vegetable crops were greatly damaged. As a result, we rarely see other vegetables in the small vegetable markets except for spinach. The reason why the price of green vegetables rose to be more expensive than meat some time ago was due to natural disasters, not human factors. According to an accurate estimate by someone familiar with the situation, those vegetable growers who work hard all year round lost at least 80,000 yuan of income per mu last winter due to the severe cold weather. This means that the southern district of Pudong alone lost 320 million yuan, which is a huge number. This is not only a loss for the farmers, but also a loss for the region.</p>
<p>Agricultural, Industrial, Commercial, and Educational Situation</p>
<p>In this area, self-cultivating farmers account for the majority, about 80%; tenant farmers are fewer, accounting for only 25%. Therefore, the relationship between farmers is still very harmonious. There are cases of usury, but they are small-scale and not public. Recently, the average interest rate has reached 45% to 50% per month. Land prices vary greatly depending on the prosperity and barrenness of the area, generally ranging from a minimum of 20,000 yuan per mu to a maximum of 700,000 yuan per mu. However, this was a survey from the end of last year, and this year's numbers are naturally much higher. Commerce is most prosperous in Dongchang Road, with a concentration of shops, which is the essence of the area. In terms of education, there is the Municipal Sanlin Middle School, which was very large in scale before the war, and three private middle schools, including Junde and Yangjing. There are fifteen municipal elementary schools and over thirty private elementary schools. Although the number is not small, it is still far from sufficient compared to the total population. School fees are slightly cheaper than in the city, because most of the students in this area are poor children, which is a necessity.</p>
<p>Newly Established Naval Baojia District</p>
<p>In terms of administration, the area is under the jurisdiction of the Pudong Southern District Public Office, which is directly under the municipal government. The current director is Mr. Zhu Yuzhen. In terms of security, the second and third battalions of the security police team are stationed in the area, but they are often transferred, so there is no fixed number. There are also water police and self-defense groups. Finally, it is worth mentioning that on March 1st of this year, a naval baojia district was newly established in the Pudong area along the river.</p>

<p>Shijiazhuang, 5th (Central News Agency) – The local Japanese garrison implemented a mopping-up campaign to cut off the Yan'an Communist bandits in central and southern Hebei Province. The comprehensive results achieved in the year from March 1st of last year to February of this year are as follows: 1,143 engagements, 72,080 enemy soldiers engaged, 4,930 enemy soldiers surrendered, 6,492 prisoners taken, 1,270 enemy facilities destroyed, 6,404 rifles captured, and a large number of other ammunition and military uniforms.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Central Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party held its 240th weekly memorial service for the late Premier at 10:00 AM this morning in the main auditorium of the headquarters. Members of the Central Executive Committee and colleagues from various ministries and commissions, as well as over 600 Kuomintang members from government agencies, attended. Secretary-General Chu Minyi presided over the ceremony and gave a speech elaborating in detail on the Premier's theory of "knowing is difficult, doing is easy" and Wang Yangming's theory of "unity of knowledge and action." The meeting adjourned around 11:00 AM.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a Cleveland dispatch, General Stilwell, commander of US ground forces, spoke at a meeting of arms manufacturers on the 7th, followed by a question-and-answer session with attendees. Regarding the general situation of Japanese troops in mainland China, he replied as follows: "There are a large number of Japanese divisions stationed in China, and the strength of each division is also very superior. In the future, we may encounter the most elite Japanese forces on the Manchurian battlefield."</p>

<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The first founding preparatory meeting of the new Japanese political society, originally scheduled for the 7th, has been postponed to 2:00 PM on the 8th at the parliament building due to unforeseen circumstances. The preparatory committee consists of 444 members, including 141 from the House of Peers, 174 from the House of Representatives, and 129 from various sectors. After the meeting on that day, a consultation is planned at Prime Minister Koiso's official residence. The preparatory committee aims to quickly form a political society, weigh party leaders, and formulate declarations, guidelines, and organizational structures, and has decided to first organize a sub-committee. Mr. Kobayashi Seizo, the initiator of the society, sent invitations on the 2nd to approximately 3,000 people, including members of both houses of parliament, those affiliated with the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and local dignitaries from across the country, requesting their endorsement and cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Abundant Japanese Manpower and Material Resources; Time More Advantageous to Japan; Grew Stresses Difficulties of American Warfare <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a New York dispatch, US Undersecretary of State Grew, speaking at a meeting of the Foreign Press Association in New York on the 1st, called for the thorough defeat of Japan, while also emphasizing the difficulties of the war against Japan as follows: "Since returning from Tokyo three years ago, I have repeatedly conveyed to the public the strength of Japan's military power and the fearsomeness of Japanese soldiers. By today, the American people should have fully recognized what kind of formidable enemy Japan is."</p>
<p>Japanese Army Has Special Beliefs</p>
<p>"The Battle of Tarawa has made the US military understand that the Japanese army is a force with special beliefs. The Battle of Manila has also given the American people the same lesson. The reason why the US military suffered so much damage in the current Battle of Iwo Jima is the result of the Japanese military's tenacious fighting. Today, Japan controls the largest trade routes in East Asia, and this region is in fact an isolated part of the world. Japan has built its country on this region with vast resources. These resources are indispensable conditions for the world economy in peacetime. For example, in the case of natural rubber, Japan's share of production accounts for 94% of the world's total. While the United States is suffering from a shortage of rubber today, Japan still has ample access to valuable rubber. In addition, the production of coconuts accounts for 83% of the total. However, the progress of the anti-Axis war is making it increasingly difficult for the Japanese army to utilize these resources. Although the US military has approached Iwo Jima, the gateway to Japan, only 700 kilometers from Tokyo, the US military and its combat power have not yet reached the point of weakening the Japanese military."</p>
<p>Military Equipment and Supplies Continue to Increase Production</p>
<p>"Japan can continue to increase production of aircraft, tanks, armored vehicles, and other military equipment. Even if the US military blockades south of Taiwan, Japan's important resources such as coal, lead, iron, and food can still be self-sufficient. Japan has abundant electricity and low production costs, and it also has reserves of aviation gasoline, which is most important for long-term warfare. As it stands, the US military supply lines are gradually expanding, while the Japanese are gradually shortening. Japan's population resources are also very abundant. Although Japan has already mobilized millions of troops, there are still millions of able-bodied men who can be mobilized immediately. In addition, Japan adds a large number of new able-bodied men every year. The losses of the Japanese army at the front are less than the number it can replenish. If the United States does not fully understand these facts, it will not be able to grasp the true nature of Japan."</p>
<p>American Ship Captain Greatly Insufficient</p>
<p>"The United States is short of ships in the Pacific War. Although this shortage of ships has existed since the beginning of the war, it will not be resolved in the future. The greatest difficulty in the anti-Axis war is the lack of transport, especially in the Pacific War. This shortage of transport requires three times as many ships for the war against Japan as for the war against Germany, calculated by time and distance. Iwo Jima is just a small dot on the map, but the tonnage of ships mobilized by the US military during the landing was actually more than that used during the landing in northern France. To give an example, the US forces landing on Luzon numbered about 100,000, and the ships required for their supplies were 1.6 million tons in the first 30 days. Even if there is no increase in troops in the future, 600,000 tons of ships will still be needed in the subsequent 30 days. Therefore, two months after the US started landing in Luzon, 2.2 million tons of ships will be needed."</p>
<p>Calling for Offensive Warfare</p>
<p>"There were about 400 enemy naval personnel landing on Iwo Jima, requiring 640,000 tons of ships in the first month and 240,000 tons in the second month, totaling 880,000 tons in two months. Thus, the United States alone is fighting on these two islands, and it is impossible not to mobilize 3.08 million tons of ships in the first 60 days. This figure accounts for 6% of the total 50 million tons of ships owned by the anti-Axis countries. As the speed and difficulty of the Pacific offensive war increase, the amount of ships required also increases. Japan is not only preparing for a ten-year war, but also preparing for a hundred-year war. The most advantageous thing for Japan is time. Japan wants to buy time to utilize the vast resources under its control. In order to break Japan's plan, we must take the offensive simultaneously in the Pacific and Europe."</p>
<p>Ambassador Kurusu's Son Killed in Action</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The son of former Ambassador Kurusu, Army Aviation Research Institute Examination Department Technical Captain Kurusu Ryo, took off from a certain base on February 14 when enemy carrier-based aircraft came to Japan. He fought eight giant-type aircraft over Chiba Prefecture, and often shot down one of them, but unfortunately he was hit by enemy bullets. However, he still managed to fly back to the base and report to the captain before succumbing to his injuries and dying in action.</p>

<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency: US troops are approaching the Rhine River. Cologne, Dusseldorf, Duisburg, and other places are close to the front line. US tanks are preparing to rush to the outskirts, and artillery is shelling the city. British and American forces apparently want to attack the area from Emmerich to Bien on the west bank of the Rhine River. Fierce fighting is taking place between Neuss and Eiffel. German reserve troops attacked the US 9th Corps between Geldern and Kleve, destroying many tanks. Most of the German troops in the rear of the US army in Monchengladbach, Gladbach, Ratingen, etc. have established contact with the German front line. The US attack on the German bridgehead west of Dusseldorf suffered heavy losses. The US attack on Cologne has not yet succeeded.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Anglo-American War Aims: To Sacrifice Small Countries <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou: According to reliable sources, the UK and the US frequently use the imminent end of the European war or post-war arrangements as bait to attract smaller nations. But can these smaller nations truly benefit from their favor? These nations are subjugated by the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union’s external security threats and economic oppression, and their political, economic, and social suffering is even deeper than during the last Great War. The UK and the US have repeatedly sacrificed smaller nations to expand their post-war influence. The Atlantic Charter, which they profess to uphold, is also trampled upon by them. This is an old trick of the Anglo-Saxon race and is not surprising. According to Reuters’ Paris correspondent, Hervé, four million Parisians are suffering from hunger and cold. Since the UK and the US invaded France, 600,000 homes have been destroyed, 18,075 miles of railways have been lost, along with 170,000 railway cars and 32,000 automobiles. It will take six years to restore pre-war productivity. The UK and the US only seek to fight Germany, disregarding the lives of the French people, which shows the situation clearly. Furthermore, after Italy’s Badoglio surrendered to the UK and the US, they should have been freed from their shackles. But what is the reality? In terms of politics and diplomacy, Italy has become a battlefield for the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union. In southern Italy, under UK and US occupation, the situation is the same as during the last Great War: unemployment, famine, crime, and prostitution are everywhere. According to Reuters, 95% of infants die due to malnutrition. As for Belgium, the people now long for the happiness of the German occupation era under the so-called liberation by the UK and the US. According to a Lisbon dispatch, the Belgian Foreign Minister flew to London to negotiate with the UK on food issues, but Belgium’s food panic is worsening, and there is no hope for foreign aid. The above are just two or three examples. In addition, the internal strife in Greece, the riots in Bulgaria, the internal conflicts in Poland, and the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia all demonstrate the ambition of the UK and the US. The UK is actively maintaining its old pre-war power, while the US is making every effort to gain a foothold in the European UK, US, and Soviet sphere of influence. The smaller nations in between are all suffering. The US's attempt to land on the Chinese mainland is similar to the situation in various small European countries.

<h3 id="e15">"Public Interest Over Private Interest" <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou once said in a public notice to the citizens: "Public interest is more important than private interest, and society comes before the individual." These two sentences are principles that every citizen should follow, especially Chinese citizens and the citizens of Shanghai in this time of national crisis and social upheaval. However, the general public in Shanghai society still ignores the meaning of these two sentences. For example, regarding the winter relief funds and the donation to the military police, the winter relief has almost ended, and the donation to the military police has already been made, so there is no need to mention them again. Why do we bring them up again today? Because the winter relief funds and the military police donation were apportioned on the spot by the Citizens' Welfare Association on the 7th of last month, inviting various trade associations, and the association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce jointly urged payment. However, up to now, only a quarter of the amount has been paid by the trade associations, totaling only 10,000,000 yuan over the course of a month. They are still waiting and watching, causing the loans borrowed by the Business Control Committee and various banks to remain unpaid. This very much reflects the Shanghai society’s general attitude of powerful figures ignoring public welfare.</p>
<p>Because most people put private interests before public interests, or even only care about private interests and disregard public interests, the country and society have evolved to such a state of decline and are looked down upon by others. People rush towards profitable things, fearing to be left behind, but everyone avoids public affairs, trying to shirk responsibility. If everyone, especially the powerful figures in society, cannot change this concept, then the collapse of society and the demise of the nation are inevitable.</p>
<p>National affairs are handled under the leadership of national leaders, and the people must obey and cooperate. Social affairs are handled under the leadership of social leaders, and social figures must also obey and cooperate. For example, Mr. Wen Lanting, Chairman of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, Mr. Li Sihao, Chairman of the Municipal Advisory Committee, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association, are all recognized as social leaders. They always stand at the forefront in leading public welfare, devoting their entire time to serving the public interest. Therefore, we should all obey and cooperate with the matters they lead. This time, they considered the allocation of winter relief funds and military police donations with enthusiasm, so there should be no bargaining after the allocation, and there should be no intentional delays. Otherwise, what is the value of having social leaders? If social affairs are not led by anyone, what will be the consequences?</p>
<p>In the past, whenever Shanghai held social welfare events, the most regrettable phenomenon was that powerful figures generally declined to attend the gatherings for public welfare, and those who were supposed to contribute money evaded responsibility even more, or simply complained about being poor to avoid responsibility. This was especially evident in the recent fundraising for winter relief funds and military police donations. For example, yesterday, at the tea party invited by various leaders for those responsible for unpaid industries, only fewer than 20 people attended out of more than 100 invitees. They all think that as long as their personal businesses are developed and huge profits can be sought, they can close their doors and enjoy themselves, and the words of social leaders can be ignored, and public opinion can be ignored. They have not thought that if the whole society is not peaceful, how can personal safety be guaranteed? If the whole country cannot survive, how can one survive alone?</p>
<p>The economic capacity of the major trade associations in Shanghai is certainly not large in themselves, but there are many wealthy members among the members of the trade associations. If social leaders assign them to bear expenses for social welfare undertakings, the chairman of the trade association should consider the strength of the members, exercise their authority, and distribute the expenses fairly, so there should be no bargaining. For example, the News Association Shanghai Branch was assigned 2,000,000 yuan in the winter relief for the military police donation. I accepted it in my capacity as the chairman of the branch, and paid the full amount within three days. In terms of the units in the newspaper industry, there are only six Chinese newspapers; in terms of economic strength, Xinzhong and other newspapers borrowed money at the end of the lunar year to pay salaries, and other newspapers are even more difficult; however, because it is a social welfare undertaking, we cannot but reluctantly undertake it, because it is an order from the social leader, we cannot but obey. As for the relationship among colleagues, the Zhonghua Daily is our leading newspaper, and in terms of qualifications, Mr. Li Sihao, president of the Xinwen Daily, is our predecessor, but I am the chairman of the branch, so I exercise my authority to allocate expenses, and as long as it is fair and reasonable, there will be no problem. Other trade associations such as banking, money exchange, yarn factories, and flour mills have also paid on time and in full, simply because they value public welfare.</p>
<p>As for those who donate to individuals, I asked Mr. Sheng Youyi for 2,000,000 yuan, and he readily agreed. I also asked Mr. Luo Hongyi, Mr. Zhang Ruitang, and Mr. Xu Changchun for 3,000,000 yuan, and they either donated themselves or raised funds, and they all paid the full amount quickly. For the sake of public welfare, I can be very straightforward in asking people, and they also agreed readily because they value public welfare.</p>
<p>The current situation is becoming more and more urgent, and the undertakings that the country should do and the public welfare that society should do are just beginning to flourish. The winter relief and the military police donation are just a small part of it. Soon, the municipal government will issue 1,500,000,000 yuan in treasury bonds, and the private sector should subscribe to at least 500,000,000 yuan. Those who have businesses, property, and power in Shanghai should actively subscribe. As for the winter relief and the military police donation, those who have been assigned but have not yet paid must pay in full before the 20th of this month. It is hoped that they will value public welfare and pay as soon as possible. Recently, there have been rumors that a giant merchant in a certain industry fled Shanghai to avoid going to a foreign country, but his real estate cannot be moved. I wonder if he will want to come back in the future? Also, the chairman of a certain association was arrested and detained by the authorities for hoarding for personal gain. The former is despised by everyone, and the latter ends up like this. All of this can serve as a warning to those who only care about private interests and disregard public welfare. Be careful!</p>

<h3 id="e16">Police Department Punishes Illegal Price-Gouging Businesses; Hopes Citizens Will Cooperate and Not Buy Goods on the Black Market <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the city's economic authorities, through the Price Review Committee, have set new price limits for 16 major commodities. Among them, 11 types were evaluated and announced for implementation in late last month. The Economic Police Fleet of the Fourth Division of the Municipal Police Bureau has directed each squad and price investigation team to conduct thorough investigations in commercial areas and stores throughout the city, and those who exceed the price limit and refuse to sell for various reasons will be investigated. It is reported that the headquarters and each squad seized a total of 41 cases on the 23rd of last month, 35 cases on the 24th, 23 cases on the 25th, 54 cases on the 26th, 86 cases on the 27th, 50 cases on the 28th, 27 cases on March 1st, 75 cases on the 2nd, and 50 cases on the 3rd. A total of 441 cases were seized in nine days, of which most were cases of exceeding the price limit. They have been dealt with in accordance with the law, treating them as first offenders and imposing fines or detention depending on the severity of the case. If they commit the offense again, their business licenses will be revoked, and they will be suspended from business. In addition, the person in charge of the headquarters told reporters that some citizens are willing to pay high prices to buy goods from illegal stores on the black market, which is unreasonable. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will cooperate with the authorities and take the announced price limit as the standard when purchasing goods. If any illegal store raises prices without authorization, it should be reported to the headquarters.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Group A Football Championship Decisive Battle; Friendship Match with Portuguese Merchants; Sunday Morning at the Racecourse <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Football Association announced the football schedule for this week yesterday, with three games on Saturday (10th) and eleven games on Sunday (11th). Among them, there is one Group A league game, two Mayor's Cup games, one Youth Cup game, and ten Group B and C league games.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Mayor's Cup semi-final play-off between the Overseas Chinese League and the Jews will be held at 3:30 PM in Jiaozhou Park, and the Overseas Chinese League will play the East China semi-final. In the Mayor's Cup semi-final at the weekend, the Shanghai Police will play the German merchants at 3:00 PM in Yiyuan. In the semi-final play-off, the German merchants defeated the Friendly Association 3-1, and the Shanghai Police eliminated the Portuguese merchants 2-1, creating an upset, which can be called a miracle. Last week, in the International Cup, Northern Europe beat Russia 1-0. The former is no different from the incarnation of German merchants, and the latter is no different from the disguised Shanghai Police.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on Sunday morning, there will be a Group A championship battle at the racecourse, with the Friendly Association and the Portuguese merchants in a decisive battle. The Friendly Association has maintained an undefeated record in this season (referring to Group A), and the Portuguese merchants are also invincible except for being defeated by the Overseas Chinese League.

<p>Since its formation, the Zhenxing Women's Ten Table Tennis Team has successively competed with several well-known teams in the city, such as Zhexing, Xinhua, Huaying, Guohua, and Dongfang. Among them, except for the defeat against Huaying, they have won every game. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, they accepted an invitation from the Dalu Bank Table Tennis Team to hold a table tennis friendship match at the bank's hall on Jing'an Temple Road. The Zhenxing team is the only women's table tennis force in the city that has emerged as a dark horse, and the latter is a veteran table tennis force in the city's banking industry. Due to work relations, they have been neglecting practice recently. Yesterday's game ended in a 3-3 draw with the Zhenxing team. After the two teams tied 2-2, the situation was very tense. In the fifth group, Wang Tieli, the main player of Zhenxing, missed her time, and Xu Haili, a new force, played instead. Due to insufficient experience, she lost. In the sixth group's variant match, Lin Jinlan of the Zhenxing team paired with Zhou Ruihua to compete against Ye Jun and Chen Haimen, strong players from Dalu Bank. As a result of the fierce battle, Zhenxing defeated Dalu and announced another victory. The game ended due to time constraints, and the two sides tied 3-3.</p>

<h3 id="e29">After the Reorganization of the Central News Agency, The First Board Meeting Unanimously Elected Minister Zhao as Chairman <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Propaganda of the National Government, considering that the mission of the Central News Agency is becoming increasingly important at this crucial stage of the Greater East Asia War, when the ideological war is becoming even more intense, has specially reorganized the Central News Agency into a public welfare corporate entity. This is to represent the position of the nation and to target the entire domestic newspaper industry, becoming a national news and telegraph agency of the Republic of China. Now that the preparatory procedures have been completed, the first board meeting was held yesterday, the 5th, at 3:00 PM, on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. Minister Zhao Zunyue of the Propaganda Department personally attended to preside over the meeting. Detailed information is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: The first board meeting of the Central News Agency was attended by Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department, as well as Chen Binhe, Xu Liqiu, Chen Riping, Jin Xiongbo, Yuan Shu (represented by Zheng Jie), Lu Feng, Ju Qingyuan, Jiang Yunzhang, and President Guo Xiufeng, among others. Minister Zhao, as chairman, delivered a speech, reporting on the significance of reorganizing the Central News Agency into a public welfare corporate entity and its future mission (the speech is recorded separately). Subsequently, President Guo Xiufeng reported on the agency's handling of affairs over the past year, elaborating in detail on establishing finances, improving the organization, fostering talent, and strengthening communications. He also expressed hope that after the reorganization of the Central News Agency, it would be able to fulfill its inherent mission as the national news agency, establish closer relationships with various newspapers, and accomplish the mission of the new era. He also stated that since the reorganization of the Central News Agency has yielded results, he hoped to take this opportunity to relinquish his responsibilities. Immediately afterward, the following matters were discussed:</p>
<p>(1) Proposal from the Chairman: Draft of the Central Telegraph Agency's Articles of Association (Resolution: amended and passed).</p>
<p>(2) Proposal from the Chairman: New organizational structure of the Central Telegraph Agency's headquarters and branches (Resolution: amended and passed).</p>
<p>(3) Proposal from the Chairman: Membership fees for the Central Telegraph Agency (Resolution: amended and passed).</p>
<p>(4) Election of the Chairman of the Board (Resolution: Minister Zhao was unanimously elected as Chairman of the Board).</p>
<p>(5) Unanimous recommendation for Guo Xiufeng to continue serving as President. Mr. Guo immediately expressed humility and declined, stating that since the reorganization of the Central News Agency has yielded results, he hoped to take this opportunity to relinquish his responsibilities. Subsequently, it was resolved that the issue of the President of the Central News Agency was of great importance and should be referred to the central authorities for instructions. Chairman Zhao was requested to deliberate and decide after returning to Nanjing, without requiring further resolution by the Board of Directors. Before a suitable candidate is determined, President Guo is requested to temporarily maintain the agency's affairs.</p>
<p>(6) Proposal from the Chairman: Budget estimates of the Central Telegraph Agency's income and expenses from March to June of the 34th year (Resolution: The regular expenses were passed according to the original proposal, and the methods for raising funds will be decided by the Standing Committee of the Board. As for the special budget, it will be raised by the Standing Committee of the Board).</p>
<p>(7) Proposal for reducing personnel and saving expenses (Resolution: To be handled by the President under the direction of the Chairman of the Board). (Other proposals omitted).</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. At 6:30 PM, Minister Zhao specially hosted a banquet for all the attending directors at the Jinmen Hotel. During the banquet, they exchanged opinions on the future development and improvement of the Central News Agency, and the gathering ended happily at 8:30 PM.</p>
<p>Minister Zhao's Speech: Minister Zhao stated: The Central Telegraph Agency is the nation's only news, telegraph, propaganda, and reporting organization. Before the incident, the Central News Agency was established. After the incident, when the National Government returned to the capital, it first merged the China News Agency in Shanghai with the China United News Agency in Nanjing, reorganizing them into the Central Telegraph Agency, making it a national news and telegraph organization. Under the guidance of the former Minister of Propaganda and the management of successive presidents, it shouldered the significant mission of propaganda and reporting for the arduous peace-building movement, making the greatest effort to promote peaceful national policies, propagandize the Greater East Asia War, and correct reactionary propaganda. It has been managed diligently and has a glorious history of five years to date. During this period, although it has experienced setbacks and difficulties due to the development of the situation and the evolution of the times, the Central Telegraph Agency, which bears the important mission of unified national telegraph services and accurate reporting, has always stood tall, struggling arduously to preserve today's achievements.</p>
<p>The news and telegraph industry is not only an important part of the cultural industry but also a major task for completing revolutionary construction and striving for national independence and survival. As the situation progresses to a new stage, the news and telegraph industry also increases its mission accordingly. Especially in the current decisive period of the Greater East Asia War, the ideological war is becoming more intense. In the past, the Central Telegraph Agency was an affiliated business organization under the jurisdiction of this Ministry. Now, in order to strengthen its organization, it has been reorganized into an independent corporate entity, so that it can establish closer ties with the national newspaper industry. On the one hand, it should be clearly aware that its position is the only national news and telegraph organization for the nation, both internally and externally, promoting national policies, releasing political news, and fulfilling the character of a national representative news agency. This is its major task. On the other hand, it is a public welfare corporate body jointly organized by the national newspaper industry, communicating news from various regions and providing telegraph news. This is its sole responsibility. In short, the Central Telegraph Agency's position should be representative of the nation, and the Central Telegraph Agency's target should be the entire domestic newspaper industry. This is the significant meaning of this reorganization of the Central Telegraph Agency. After this reorganization, the Central Telegraph Agency is different in nature from its previous status as a business organization affiliated with the government. However, the government still maintains a guiding position, so that the whole country can jointly seek development to complete the Central Telegraph Agency's new mission for the times.</p>

<h3 id="e30">A Street Child on Yongshou Street: A Statement After Being Sheltered <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>This office previously received a letter from Mr. Wu Jingyi, stating that there was a homeless street child on Yongshou Street, who was of good character, did not associate with beggars, and had never begged from people. He hoped that this office and child welfare organizations would extend a helping hand and find a way to shelter him. After contacting the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage and sending staff to investigate, it was confirmed that he was indeed an orphan who had lost both parents, and he has been sheltered. Now we have received a statement from him after entering the orphanage, excerpted as follows, to clarify the truth:</p>
<p>"I am an unfortunate child. My family originally lived on Nanyang Bridge, and the family's economic situation was still relatively comfortable. At that time, I was studying at the Lagenna Elementary School on Huanghe Road. After the incident, my father lost his job, and prices were rising, making life difficult. Later, my father found a job in Nanjing, so he left Shanghai and moved to Nanjing. My studies were interrupted from then on. I lived in Nanjing for more than a year, but unexpectedly, an accident occurred last June. Because my father's salary was very low and not enough to cover the family's expenses, he tried to bring some capital to Shanghai to do business. Who knew that after arriving in Shanghai, there was no news at all. My mother and I were very anxious, not knowing whether he was alive or dead, so we pawned all the furniture in Nanjing and used the money as travel expenses to rush to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, my father in Shanghai gambled away all the capital he had brought from Nanjing. My mother and I rushed to Shanghai, but he was already penniless, and there was nothing we could do but become homeless. Unexpectedly, misfortunes never come singly. Both my parents contracted dysentery and passed away, leaving me alone, with no relatives to turn to, lonely and helpless. I built a small shack near Yongshou Street and went out every day to collect waste paper and rags to maintain my livelihood. After more than a month, Mr. Wu Jingyi, who runs the Chenjudian wire shop across the street, was very enthusiastic. Seeing that I was pitiful, he asked your newspaper to help introduce me to the Nanshi Dongjiadu Fuyou Orphanage. I get two meals of porridge and one meal of rice a day, and the teachers are very enthusiastic in their guidance. The order and cleanliness are good, and the rules are strict. It is truly a paradise for orphaned children. Therefore, I want to thank your newspaper and Mr. Wu for the introduction. Respectfully, Orphan Shen Shede."</p>
<p>Please Repair the Old Zhabei Bridge</p>
<p>A group of people wrote in a letter: "Since the opening of the Old Zhabei Bridge on Beijing Road in this city on the 12th of this month, pedestrians have been coming and going in an endless stream. However, due to years of disrepair, several places have already been damaged. If you are groping in the dark during an air raid, it is easy to cause danger. Even rickshaws, if they are not careful, may slip and fall. Therefore, we hope that the authorities will repair it as soon as possible for the benefit of pedestrians. We sincerely hope for this."</p>
