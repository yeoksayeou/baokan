<h3 id="c2">趙宣傳部長　昨晚廣播 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　宣傳部趙部長，三十日晚八時二十分至五十分，作廣播演講，題爲「和平運動與國民革命」，首　，國府還都五年中，由於政局演進及時局擴展，救國已進入對內需要和平統一，對外迫切需要自由之緊要階段。繼提出三項問題，加以闡述，略謂：第一，中日和平運動之本質，即國民革命之再出發，全面和平之實現，乃整個局勢轉危爲安之唯一救星，中國之前途，東亞之前途，均寄託於和平運動之上。第二，關於反共，中共爲逞其纂政大慾，一再阻撓中國之和平統一，自國府還都後，更變本加厲，一而高唱民族統一陣綫，宣揚無底抗戰，一面擴充軍隊，爭奪地盤，故從歷史上認識中共，中共不僅足以妨礙和平統一，且足以牽制復興建國大業，故舉國上下應貫澈反共主張。第三，關於建國工作，非三年五年一蹶可成者，需數十年數百年之努力，根據過去歷史，如法國·美國·日本，均爲數十年甚至百數十年努力始能成功者，全國上下祈望信賴政府，本公而忘私之精神，一致奮鬥，持久奮鬥，始能成功。</p>

<h3 id="c4">戰時民衆代會　昨行閉幕式　發表大會宣言及通電 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　各省市戰時民衆代表會議，三十日爲大會第三日，上午十時仍在國民大會堂繼續舉行，首由秘書長宣讀大會宣言草案，起草人分別宣讀通電，（一）世界各國家各民族，（二）東亞各民族電文草案，當經全塲一致通過。各省市戰時民衆代會在此於熱烈情緒中，完成其使命，旋即舉行大會開會式。當由大會主席徐冽致閉會詞，略謂：此次大會決議案，我們希望政府能採納，但我們不要忘記自己是民衆，我們要自己去實行，自己的決議要從自己做起，不要依　別人，要從現在做起，亦要推路將來。記得汪故主席曾說過中國定能得救，因爲中國有四萬萬個不死的良心，天將亮了，統一的呼聲已經喊出，我們要拿出良心來，向着光明的前途遇進。</p>
<p>宣言全文</p>
<p>全國民衆鑒於時局日趨嚴重，國家前途安危，間不容髪，深感國家興亡，匹夫有責，亟應團結國民，一致奮起，協力政府共濟時艱，乃於首都集結各省市民衆代表本自發自覺精神，舉行全國各省市戰時民衆代表大會，磋商國事，就各地方之疾苦情形及民衆要求，充分貢獻政府，團結總力，一致　鬥，以爭取中國之自由，完成國內之統一。</p>
<p>大會所負使命異常重大，不但對於目前政治，經濟，社會，文化種種不良現象，謀根本解決，幷對於民生建設諸途，均經籌議對策，促請政府採擇施行，更以展開統一救國運動爲大會之重心，藉以打破目前政治上之僵局，開關中國今後之出路，解決國人一般心理上之苦悶，遵奉國父遺敎，完成國民革命之大業。謹將吾人所認爲今後民族民權民生三方面所應注意者，分述如左：</p>
<p>展開救國運動</p>
<p>（一）展開統一救國運動，完成國民革命，旣爲救中國之唯一正確目標，全國同胞自當結集總力以赴，凡過去拘執於黨派觀念階級意識地域偏見者，均應一致放棄，在國家民族最高至上之原則下，展開統一救國運動，由國民之團結，形成政治力量之團結，由思想主義之統一，促成行動步議之統一，然後始足以建設現代之國家，爭取國家民族之獨立自由平等。故吾人主張奉行國父遺敎，以求國民理念之統一，完成國民組織，以求國民力量之强化，循此上下一心，精誠團結，以完成國民革命之大業。幷呼　列强，勿以中國爲戰塲，更勿以飛機到處轟炸，以保存國家元氣，維護同胞之安全</p>
<p>統一全國行政</p>
<p>（二）統一全國行政機構，早日完成全國獨立統一。國府還都以後，全國若干地區，一方狃子地方積習相沿之歷史性與環境關係，未能大刀闊斧，將地方反革命之腐化惡化勢力根本澄淸，一方受戰爭猶在賡續進行之影響，諱疾忌醫，多所牽制，故必須統一全國各地行政機構，早日完成全國獨立統一。</p>
<p>言論集會自由</p>
<p>（三）保障國民言論集會自由，設立各級民意機關。國父曾昭示吾人政治之意義，乃管理衆人之事，而最了解衆人之事者，莫過於國民本身。中華民國爲中華國民之民國，國父在民權主義與建國大綱中，均殷殷以培養國民政治力量爲念，在目前之中國，無論對內對外，均需政權與治權互助，始能克服時艱，政府與民衆協力，始能推進政治，政府必須頒佈法令，保障人民集會自由，同時中央與地方分別設立各級民意機關，以爲人民結集總力，表達民意之組織。</p>
<p>完成地方自治</p>
<p>（四）早日完成地方自治，戰後召開國民大會。地方自治爲民權訓練之基礎，必須地方自冶完成，始能實施憲政。事變以前，議者不察，要求早日結束訓政，實施憲政，實不明建國程序之劃分，欲重蹈袁氏纂國之覆轍。今日之計，必須遵照國父遺敎，早日宛成地方自治，以爲實施憲政之基礎，至於國民大會之召開，雖屬切要之圖，便在目前無大會代表之產生及各地國民大會代表之選舉，均有事實上種處之困難，不能卒爾從事，即使草草辦理，必不能代表眞正民意，反供官僚政客之利用，以作私人政爭之工具，目前只能作國民大會召開之種種籌備工作，戰爭結束以後，即行召集實施憲政。（未完）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c5">澈查擾亂市塲的投機者 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>近來本市市塲惰形，又呈混亂狀態，最値得注目的，一是一般不急不需物品價格的疲落，二是黃金公債等黑市和股票的瘋狂上漲。就物價下跌而言，一般物價之下跌驟看似乎是好現象，但是攷查實際，跌風最勁的是化裝品，較年初約跌百分之五十，其餘跌到百分之十以上的，如捲烟·報紙·細布·木炭等，攷其跌價原因，不是因爲季候關係，不能再事囤積，或爲市民購買力薄弱，高價無人問津而出籠；便是由於國積者脫貨求現以謀另覓投機暴利；至於平民生活必需品特別是食品，則其下跌甚緩，或且不跌而繼續上漲，如食米一項，三月中旬較上旬僅跌百分之一，麵粉在同期僅跌百分之三·六，食鹽反漲七·七，豆油亦漲四·六（三月二十四日中國產業報統計）。這種物價漲落的趨勢，並無樂觀可言。一般市民的生活壓迫未有分毫輕鬆，而另一種社會經濟的危機，却已伸展其更可怕的黑影，緊壓着每一個正當的市民。</p>
<p>這黑影就是黃金公債股票的瘋狂暴漲。以黃金黑市來說，去年十一月爲一〇〇，則十二月增百分之三二·八，今年一月較十二月增五四·六，今年二月又較一月激增至一二二·五，三月上旬較二月增六·三，三月中旬較上句又增一〇·九，三月下旬繼續狂漲，目前已超過五百萬大關！就股票而言，熱門股的永安紗廠，由一月底五八五元，漲至三月底之一，八二〇元；商務書館由一八，〇〇〇元，漲至二五，〇〇〇元；康元製罐由一二九元漲至三一〇元，景綸衫襪由二四元漲至五三元；其餘大部份都已漲到百分之五十以上。此外公債的黑市，也都呈瘋狂上漲之勢。</p>
<p>我們爲什麽說這種上漲的現象是威脅社會經濟的黑影呢？因爲，這種上漲是社會經濟危機的反映而非正常現象，黃金·公債等等，從經濟立塲言，已經與物價不發生直接關係，即物價上漲，黃金亦不應暴漲，何况物價幷不上漲，黃金更絕對沒有上漲的根據，它所以上漲，完全由於投機和謠言所促成！至於股票，我們誠然希望它有健全性的上漲，藉以吸收資產者的過剩購買力，作爲生產資金；但實際上最近的狂漲，正在百業蕭條生產停頓之時，怎能解說這種上漲有助於增產呢？其實也和黃金公債之暴漲一樣，是最可怕的投機的結果。</p>
<p>進一步硏究這種市塲危機的造成，完全是以舊曆年關爲契機的，也就是說是以當時開始的敵美硫黃烏登陸及克里米亞會議而展開的；由於一般人對於戰局的直覺的錯誤觀察，由於敵方對於戰塲與政治的謀略宣傳，一般投機家遂　機造作謠言，推波助瀾，若干執有游資者，及囤積物資者，也受了投機者的謠言所惑，或直接以其資金，或拋出戰爭條件下有喪失危機的物資，換取現金而一致捲入瘋狂的市塲浪潮。這種盲目行動的結果，對於社會經濟之攪亂，却不能不負其責任，而使一股市民食其惡果！</p>
<p>市塲混亂已無過於今日！而中下階層市民生活之困苦，正當工商業經營者之無法維持，亦復無過於今日！且市塲混亂更足以愈陷一般市民與正當工商業於痛苦深淵，形成社會經濟的嚴重危機，在此決戰局面，在此上海市政漸入正軌之時，決不容許這種造謠投機的存在。不久以前，特別法庭上海分庭成立，對於危害戰時經濟的罪犯行爲，應即發揮制裁力量。因此，我們希望市政當局嚴切注意，澈查擾亂市塲的投機者，予以斷然的嚴厲處置，以遏亂萌。</p>

<p>陳彬龢詞</p>
<p>今天是國民政府還都五周年紀念日，中國新聞協會上海區分會爲表示慶祝，舉行足球比賽，有兩點意義，可以象徵我們的努力方向：</p>
<p>第一，我們有目標，足球賽的目標是攻進對方球門，而目前大東亞戰爭的目標，是實現大東亞各民族的解放。敵人英美過去奴役大東亞民族，而坐吮　血，迨大東亞戰爭發動，將英美奴役美夢澈底粉碎，揭開民族解放曙光。而敵人不甘放棄奴役美夢，憑其殘餘勢力，企圖復逞，這是威脅我們全東亞民族生存的危機，我們當齊心一力，堅持完成我們的最終目標。</p>
<p>第二，足球比賽中各個隊員均有崗位，彼此聯絡，呼應攻守，而我們全東亞各國家人民也都有崗位，各人應各自守定崗位，羣策羣力，齊向共同目標邁進。</p>
<p>我們今天在此慶祝國府還都紀念，同時鑒於大東亞戰爭已達最緊張的決戰階段，我們必須效法足球員的奮發精神，堅守　位，呼應一致，密切聯絡，驅逐敵人，完成中國統一解放大業，完成整個大東亞民族的解放大業。</p>
<p>今天承蒙盟邦陸海軍報道部長蒞臨致詞，表示　　，復承盟邦海軍樂隊蒞塲演奏，更爲欣　，並對參加足球比賽的隊員諸君，一併誌謝。</p>
<p>三團體慶祝會</p>
<p>本市市民福利協曾·市商會·中國新聞協會上海區分會三團體，聯合於下午五時，在大光明戲院舉行慶祝大會，情况熱烈。由市民福利協會理事長聞關亭，市商會理事長袁腹登，新聞恊會上海區分會理事長陳彬龢爲大會主席團，並敦前市府羅秘書長，市宣傳處劉處長蒞臨致訓。</p>
<p>袁履登開會詞</p>
<p>袁履登氏致開會詞，略謂：「今天三團體，舉行國民政府還都五週年紀念慶祝大會，承諸位光臨，非常榮幸。今天我們舉行慶祝會的意義在那裏？我們應該檢討一下：第一，以盟邦日本的協力，不平等條約取消了，租界收回了，中國已經踏上了自由獨立的坦途，數十年來的宿願實現了，我們應該怎樣的努力，使中國完成其復興建設呢？第二，中國已經參戰了，和盟邦站在一條戰綫上，爲擊滅英美而奮鬥。可是，英美野心難戢，如今又逐步的侵寇東亞了，我們應該怎樣去打擊他們，使他們不再爲禍於東亞呢？第三，在戰局益趨緊張的現階段，舉國上下，必須團結一致，堅强其意志，齊一其步伐，刻苦耐勞，勇猛精進，集結總力，貢獻戰爭，我們對此有沒有完全做到呢？以上三點，我們必須加以深切的體認與努方。總之，我們必須加緊努力，貢獻總力，向興復中華保衛東亞之途邁進。」</p>
<p>羅秘書長致訓</p>
<p>詞畢，請羅秘書長致訓。大意略謂：「諺云：「天助自助」，「自求多福」，現在戰禍已經彌漫全世界，在戰爭過程中，任何國家的國民，免不了受到痛苦，因爲有痛苦，希望求取福利更爲迫切，戰爭就是求取福利的代價。上海有市民福利協會，市商會等團體，均以求取市民福利爲目標。可是，因爲百年來，英美奴役上海的結果，養成大多數市民重私利的習慣，譬如未有保甲制度以前，市民之間，有着各掃自己門前雪不管人家瓦上霜的態度，極少互助精神，現在市政當局可以向市民保證決不自私自利，而盡所有的力量爲市民謀福利。市府同人決追隨市民之後，使市政步入正軌，也可以說當局領導市民使市政步入正軌。所以，使市政步入正軌，不但是市府方面的責任，人民也有共同的責任，官民打成一片，才能達到目的。今天紀念國府還都，提出希望兩點：（一）市民必須發揮自力求取福利。（二）市民必須熱心參加有益社會的組織，由團結的力量，求取整個社會的福利，然後個人的福利亦可達到。」最後即放映「回頭是岸」影片，直至七時始行散會。</p>

<p>中國新聞協會上海區分會爲慶祝國府還都紀念，昨舉行足球表演賽於跑馬廳，特請盟邦日本上海陸軍報道部長出淵中佐及艦隊報道部長松島大佐先後致詞。茲將演詞依次錄下：</p>
<p>今天欣逢還都紀念，本人以爲非常値得慶祝的。　顧國府還都以來，就開始確立和平反共國策與調整中日基本關係，先有中日基本條約的成立，繼於民國三十年十二月，日本帝國爲求東亞安定目存自衛，對英美宣戰，中日兩國於是根據基本條約的精神，決心同甘共苦，國府乃宣吿參戰，中日關係益加親密。更値得注目的，是在還都後的第三年，日本政府交還專管租界，承認收回上海公共租界，厦門公共租界及北平的公使館區域，並撤廢治外法權，交還敵產等。民國三十三年六月三十日，上海租界交還完畢，進入第五年後，國府力謀確立戰時態勢，在該年十一月十日，汪主席逝世，這是東亞民族一件悲痛的事。今日東亞戰局，日益慘烈，驕敵英美或將在中國大陸登陸，並一步步遍近日本本土，但我日本已充分準備，全國人民實行總武裝，等着敵人來臨。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，是不但日本，並且是決定東亞民族興亡的戰爭，如不能獲勝，則東亞民族之興隆不可求，中國之建設不能成，希望諸君在陳代主席領導下，遵從肅正思想，確保治安，增加生產的三大國策，以期完成決戰態勢，獲得最後勝利而後已。</p>
<h3 id="c19">作戰到底　蘄求光明前途　松島海軍報道部長演詞 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>在國府還都紀念的今天，能與充溢着建國精神的中國靑年們會見，參與歷史性的盛典，除衷心祝福中國前途無疆外，並引爲最光榮的事。國民政府還都以來，已五易寒暑，其間經過不知多少的艱難和鍛練，到今天能够奠定了和平建國的牢固基礎，成爲建設大東亞的中心體，向前邁進，此完全可說是由於中國諸前擊繼承國父孫文先生的遺志，充分了解大東亞命運與中國的使命所致，今日追憶以往瞻，望前途，深感靑少年諸君的責任更爲重大。</p>
<p>戰局已入決戰階段</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭已臨決戰階段，我日本依照旣定戰略，誘敵入本土近海以　擊滅之。三月十七日以後的戰局，已進入了眞正的決戰階段，敵美軍幾乎集中太平洋艦隊的全部力量，不顧一切而作戰，硫黃島作戰以後，敵人損失爲歷史上空前者，登陸軍六萬人中半數以上覆滅。又在日本本土南方海面空戰中，敵艦船隊受到損失，亦極慘重，今日琉球羣島方面，作戰僅不過幾天，而敵艦船已失三分之一以上，敵人作戰今後趨向如何，吾人可不加探求，但吾人使命唯在使敵大量流血以粉碎共野心。美國今日所感苦悶的是人力資源的缺乏，所以他們即使用如何龐大的物量，其失敗受挫之日，已在不遠。</p>
<p>敵美實力日見削弱</p>
<p>我們爲了防備中國大陸化成戰塲，正在盡一切努力，目前琉球方面戰事，也是防衛戰的序幕。</p>
<p>敵美太平洋艦隊，其第三艦隊在菲島作戰以前，即吿潰滅解體，現在僅第五第七兩艦隊存在，敵人進行作戰，隨着他們的勢力，日見消滅，戰艦航空母艦等爲數益少。</p>
<p>去年十月菲島方面開始作戰時，敵人集中艦艇有一千三百餘艘，飛機二千架以上，但到今年二月硫黃島作戰時，艦艇減至六百艘，飛機一千架左右，目前琉球方面已減到艦艇百艘左右，飛機亦一天少一天，且敵機航空人員中竟有六十歲以上的老年人，不穿襪子，種種窮態不一而足，雖然他們努力宣傳，但不能掩飾美軍陷於極困難狀况。吾人思及戰爭勝負，決定於最後五分鐘，必須立即奮起殲滅敵人。</p>
<p>犧牲一切保衛國土</p>
<p>中日兩國是大東亞的核心，爲了保衛國土並實現獨立自衛，應不惜一切犧牲以赴，况阻逼敵人在中國登陸，是在謀中國民衆的安寗與福利，我們看到義大利和法國的前例，不能不防止中國大陸化成戰塲。</p>
<p>敵方宣傳，中國登陸目的在結束戰爭拯救中國，這完全是欺人之談，如果一且成爲事實，則中國又化爲　土，中國人民將逢到比較今日更加幾十倍的苦痛。</p>
<p>世界現在已臨興亡關頭，吾人　以完成國家使命作戰到底，以　求將來的光明和發展。今天値此紀念日，希望諸位更加奮起努力，以顯揚國父遺業。</p>

<h3 id="c20">菲島日軍司令　山下大將訪問記 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>敵美的大砲轟擊，以及飛機爆炸，每天總是靈複五六次的。在距離前綫很近的小屋中，菲律賓派遺軍最高指揮官山下奉女大將，正安然地坐在椅子上。在將車的起居間裏，有一張小的圓棹，兩把椅子，一個茶杯一個灰盤。將軍並不想說什麼，只是炯炯的眼光注視着我，「你究竟想問什麼？」我處在這樣情形下，便不想問什麼了。山下大將神色自若地坐在椅子上，似乎有千鈞之重。</p>
<p>「現在似乎聽不到轟炸聲了，到外邊稍微散散步怎樣？」</p>
<p>將軍提着手杖地站起來，踏着落葉，便打破了菲島決戰開始以來第五偭月頭上的沉默，終於回答記者的話了。</p>
<p>問：閣下曾說過，敵人業已深入我們日本的腹部；這究竟是什麼意思？</p>
<p>答：現在可以說了，我們日本的最初計劃就是誘敵深入呂宋島的平原和馬尼刺，然後由四面八方加以包圍殲減。我們按照這一計劃作戰，非常順利。敵方損失七萬之衆，也就是這一計劃的結果。但這以前稱作前期作戰，菲鳥方面車發揮眞正本領的主海作戰，還在後面。</p>
<p>問：然而我們日本在劇烈的戰爭當中，還不是也受到很大的損失麼？</p>
<p>答；實在令人出手意外，日本損失非常少。遠較我們所預期的少。衝鋒，這是敢死隊的工作，這種敢死隊多半都成功了。旣有這樣精忠報國的神兵，還有不勝的道理麼？</p>
<p>問：內地的日本人都在期得着菲島日軍施展一個大的反攻作戰，那末閣下的意見如何呢？</p>
<p>答：兵是見機而動的，是虛虛實實而戰的。如遇到一個機會，則大動一下，並進行殲滅敵人的大攻勢作戰。如無機會，則十年二十年也要在此堅持下去，不斷消耗敵美的兵力，盡量多多拖住敵方的兵力，使敵方無力進攻其他地方。在最近期內，一定會發見反攻機會的。目前的陣勢，是無往而不利的。日本軍隊業已準備任何的情形，可以勿作杞人之憂。</p>
<p>－將軍又轉了話頭，暢談國家百年大計，大講敎育救國。將軍吐露出平常的抱員，即改革日本家庭敎育，母親敎育，國民學校等，這眞是令人驚嘆不置。</p>
<p>「看着遠，而實際近的，就是敎育問題。日本人如再受一點好的家庭敎育，這個戰爭或許早已勝利了。但單純具有必勝信念，且很忠勇，這並不是致勝的法門。假如國民當中認爲現在取勝利了，或完全失敗了，這樣人還是姑且專心從事自巳的家庭敎育和子女敎育好些吧！」</p>
<p>－山下大將仍然健在於菲島。記者經過長時間的談話後，而又談到題外的敎育論上去，更加使我信賴將軍了。（吉村隊尼刺通信）（譯自三月十日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3 id="c21">敵方幼稚謀略 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>正月上旬太平洋問題調查會決議的日本處理案，在前月中旬已見發表。唯此次又聞另有美國財長摩根韜起草的日本處理案。</p>
<p>此種方案，在我們是不足這的。正如我們繼續研究如何使戰爭目的具體化一樣，敵方也一味討論其目的，或發表之。這類文件如果一一閱覽，除了自費時問以外，是一無可得的。我們應該將這種時間用在爭取勝利上。不過，不論任何國家中，總有若干胆怯者流，每易上了敵方幼稚謀略的當，甚至混濁國內的空氣。因此，關於日本處理案的敵方用心，殊有一加說明的必要。</p>
<p>第一須知所謂摩根韜方案，實際祗是一種謀略宣傳。眞正的日本處理案，至少在前年夏天已經寫成，並且已由華盛頓政府奉呈於其主人華爾街財閥的面前了。同年十一月末舉行的開羅會談席上，羅斯福己將其一端吿知蔣介石。比較精密地反映該案的，就是太平洋問題調查會的決議案。該調查會隱於所謂民間機關的這一前提下，將這眞正的處理秦僞裝成美國的輿論。</p>
<p>摩根韜所草擬的，乃是圖使日本人中胆怯懦弱之輩崩潰的謀略。據電訊所傳，似乎祇要日本人捨去大國民的驕傲態度，戰爭就可解決。在這裏就包藏敵方幼稚的企圖。如果眞的一旦無條件降服，敵方就可食言自甘，施行其眞的處理案。此種幼稚的謀略一經說明，實在不值分文，但我們也須顧意以免萬一（譯自三月八日每日新聞）</p>

<p>冲繩列鳥位於琉球羣島之中央，列鳥中面積最大者爲冲繩本島，四屬有伊平　，慶良間，西米國久米等屬島，均由北方蜿對至西南方。敵登陸之慶良間列鳥，位於冲繩本島西方二十五公里，係以渡嘉數，前渡，座間味，阿　，廢止間，白志富，里前等八島所組成。在此列鳥中，敵已登陸者爲渡嘉敷，座間味及阿嘉三島，其中渡嘉敷及座間即爲慶良間列島中最大都，渡嘉敷島面積僅爲八·五平方公里，座間味島爲八平方公里，慶良間列島之土質，大抵與沖繩本島同屬火山岩，古期岩，地勢極峻，山上樹木繁茂，鹿及其他野獸頗多。惟敵所企圖者乃沖繩本島之登陸，敵一部兵力在慶良間列島登陸，其目的乃以此作爲侵攻冲繩本島之跳板，冲繩本島長的百三十公里，最開處爲三十五公里，最狹處五公里，爲一細長形之島嶼，周圍的四百公里，面積連各小島在內，共一千二百十一平方公里，若與硫黃鳥之二十平方公里相較，的爲六十倍。沖繩本島位於日本南九州及台靈二大戰略基地之中央，相距各約五百公里。前次台灣海面空戰大戰果，係在日本本土與菲島中間之台　東方所獲得，今沖繩本島因位於日本本土與台灣之中間，是故與日機之行動半徑大見接近，日方處此有利地位，則邀擊敵軍必能予敵重創。</p>
<h3 id="c23">關於配給制度之詮釋 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>配給制度爲戰時經濟之重要對策，在昔承平時代，物力充盈，生活低廉，貿易公平，家給人足，原不需要配給。我國自事變以還，因戰事關係，生產減少，物資逐漸缺乏，於是有財力者，操縱居奇，囤積牟利，平民生計，頓受極大威脅，激起市面動蕩，阢隍不寗，政府爲安定民生計，乃有配給制度之產生。</p>
<p>按配給制度推行於我國尙屬初次，而尤以上海地方範圍最大，亦最複雜。上海物品配給事宜經過當局兩年多以來努力，雖粗具規規模，但以情形複雜，及民衆未能十分了解配給意義，又物資來源不暢，故未能達到充分圓滿目的。</p>
<p>物品配給制度原欲使民衆以低廉代價，普遍獲得生活必需品，以維持其生活，且所得物品務求平均，方合配給本旨。惟值此社會人心不古，狡黠之徒，恒利用配給關係，朦報戶名，或虛增人口，以及一人兼領數份配給物品等種種弊　。蓋以全市數百萬人口，苟非有人洞悉實情，向配給機關舉發，甚難查其究竟，此點在辦理配給機關，最感困難。所以希望人民，自行檢東，不再有此種舉動發生。其有少數不良份子，仍蹈故轍者，應大衆一致舉發，視爲公敵。因多消耗一分配給物力，即減少眞正市民一分配給利益，市民爲維持本身利益計，應官民一併協力。</p>
<p>配給物品本以生活必需品爲主，如食米·麵粉·煤球·火柴·肥皂等類，年來以生產減少，原料缺乏，運輸困難，出品供不敷求，且成本提高，故戶口配給不能按期配發，即特種配給，亦不免延期，此係事實使然，無可如何。本處現正竭力設法，與各有關方面連贛，取得圓滑，使配給品量增强，以副市民期望。</p>
<p>本人自任事以來，瞬將三月，對於配政之檢討，處務之進行，夙夜不　，所願與市內腎達，同心協心，研求改進，以收合作之效，尙希隨時予以匡助是幸。</p>

<p>遇到轟炸，防空壕是我們避免災害，保全生命的地方。所以我們應當好好地保護防空壕，以防損毀，免得急來要用的時候發生困難。</p>
<p>對於防止防空壕的損壞有數點提供，希當局及保甲人士注意並推行之：</p>
<p>（一）現在的防空壕，大都是在泥地上掘一坑，或再在其上搭竹架，再覆以泥土，所以極容易損壞，應在防空壕附近設置自警團崗位，監視並阻止行人之無意摧毀，或兒童們攀登。</p>
<p>（二）防空壕在平時應加上鎖，以免有人傾倒垃圾，反爲藏垢納污之所。及兒童們作爲遊戲塲。</p>
<p>（三）防空壕應覆以遮蓋物，免天雨時雨水流入，反爲病菌及蚊納滋生地。</p>
<p>現在防空壕的建設，經當局的努力推進，已相富普遍。但若照人口計算，則不敷甚多，還應努力加緊建造。在尙未足够平均支配的時候，我們要對現在所有的防空壕加以愛護，勿使損壞。</p>

<p>— 劉育五</p>
<p>上海物資配給制度，發軔於民國三十年五月間，當時米糧發生恐慌，舊工部局會委託立基與祥在兩洋行，訂購洋米運滬，由各登記米號申請領購，供給一般市民之需要。</p>
<p>三十年六月以後，上海物價突然高漲，舊工部局爲統制民食上主要物資起見，在總務局內增設物價調查課，二年後，該課改爲物資統制部，不久又改爲物資統制局。其主要工作在統制物價，檢舉奸商。機構分爲六課，即總務·配給·採辦·公會·調查執行·及原價計算。由稻垣登氏任局長，以下有中外職員約六百餘名。</p>
<p>三十二年八月租界收回，第一區公署成立後，物資統制局經改爲經濟處，此時曾辦理舊一八兩區及滬西新併入區之一切配給行政，首任處長爲陳日平氏，後由馮攸繼任，其內部組織，逐决改爲五科，即總務。物資採辦配給·物價·工商管理及金融</p>
<p>三十三年八月中旬，經濟處與糧食局奉令裁撒，以糧食局爲主體，於市府內，另組織一物品配給處，馮攸氏任處長，除日籍職員平野修氏任諮議，福田敏郎氏任專員外，其餘皆本讓職員。</p>
<p>本年一月初，市府改組，物品配給處長由劉星晨氏接任，仍繼續辦理滬市一切配給物資之戰時經濟行政。</p>
<p>（二）配給品種類及來源</p>
<p>茲將上海主要配給物資，分類加以叙述之如左</p>
<p>（一）食米及麵粉－過去所配給之食米及麵紛，其數量均由糧食調整委員會（糧盒局局畏爲委員長）核准。食米則由配給處向米糧統制委員會搜購國麵粉則由上海區粉麩統配處供給。其數量及價格，均由該委員會核定。</p>
<p>（二）食油－此項配給之數量及價格，均由油糧專業委員會核准後，交食油統配處供給配售。</p>
<p>（三）食糖－此項配給物資，經批准後，交糖商合作營業處供給。其數量及價格，由雙方核定。</p>
<p>（四）煤球－此項原料，係由配給處，經商准後，令石炭聯合會交付大中聯煤號配給各指定煤球廠製這，其數量及價格，隨時與有關各方核定。</p>
<p>（五）火柴－此項物資，係由上海燐寸協會供給，其數量及價格，由關係當局與該會核定。</p>
<p>（六）肥皂－此項物資，係與六廠即五洲藥房固本皂廠，中國化學工業社，大新化盟廠，明星香水肥皂廠，亨利皂燭碱廠及日本油脂會社，訂立合同供給配售。</p>
<p>（七）人造奶油－此項物資係由配給處，向關係當局商准後，向中國食油公司購進，其價格則由三方共同核定，並專爲配給購買麵包者。</p>
<p>除上述七種配給物資外，尙有牛奶，食鹽，煤斤等之配給，（牛奶現　依然有配給，食鹽與煤斤，尙無統盤計劃成功。）</p>

<p>— 劉臨</p>
<p>你來信。寫道：</p>
<p>你們的學校放假了吧？在我，很希望能有一個短短的假期供我休息，看點想看的書。訪訪想見面的朋友……可是總不能够。每天淸早出去，寒氣侵骨，深晚回來，還得安步當車，所問的還不是保住個半飢不飽的職薪，所得之數寥寥，够派什麼用？我逐漸感到像我這一類的人是社會　最不幸的人了。老兄者，雖然是苦讀，總比我强，至少還有追求理想的熱情，我盼望你能抓牢你的學校生活。一入社會，一切希望都將粉碎－－除非能隻身跳出生活的縛束，還我一個自由的生命！</p>
<p>生活把我們箍得太緊了。即使在求學，我的心也和你一樣緊在一個問題上：「怎樣活下去？」學校不是一個和社會隔絕的圈子。你希望我不要拋了學校生活，說是求學的時候「有追求理想的熱情」，還不是你想在記憶裏採取一點溫暖，你會經這樣寫：「……我又重新把我底們過去咀嚼一番，過去的一切仿彿更甜蜜了，」看過這兩年裏一切的變動吧，連你自己在內。我猜想眼前你一定感到孤獨。孤獨會使一個人變得挹　的。如果你能像在學校裏一樣，和許多朋友混在一起，或者，就和幾個親密的友人在一起吧，你便會重新燃起你的熱情。在生活的重壓下，靈魂的皺痕是難一抹去的。你一定難於安排你的心緒，也許「重逢」裏的你的友人和你融和起來，正好是你自己的寫照，刻劃了你底思想的矛盾。你僧厭都市，那麼你愛鄉村？你自己也知道鄉村和都市一樣有社會性的　結在。可能鄉村裏的人比較樸質和勤儉，但眼前鄉村裏的農夫已經儉，樸質，他們變得頗　巧，甚至譏詐。至於另外一些「無聲地掙扎着的貧農」難道還會帶給你希望？你憶念裏的家鄉和謐靜的生活絕然是另一個情景，那是美麗的幻夢。如果你再去到鄉間，你會失望，不僅僅是懷疑自己的理想而是再沒勇氣追求了。</p>
<p>我得重覆一下，你正處在孤獨的情部下；你沒有被捲進社會的濁流，你是堅定的。而且事實上你也無從插足進你周　的一羣。由於孤獨，你變得悒鬱。你祇見自己的生活和家庭——恕我講的太過火了。這樣你會嗟嘆，以爲自已是世上最不幸的人。生活需要勇氣，而這勇氣祇有生活能給你。勞苦的工作不應該使你底追求理想的勇氣損減。懷古幽情，在我們只是一種羈絆。如果那安慰是虛渺的，我們就撇了它，沒有安慰，難道我們就沒法堅持辛勞了！</p>
<p>你銳最好能「隻身跳出生活的縛束，還我一個自由的生命」，不知道你的「生活」指什麼？如果指生活的苦悶，似乎還　得通。我相信你決沒有想超脫麈世的觀念，但，你的字句的氣勢和含義，叫人感到太羅曼蒂克一點。你覺得了嗎？我們應該有個信心，有維謹這信心的些小詩，時常提到黑夜中</p>
<p>寫了這末些，真是沒想到的。我們平日相見的　會太少了。最近我找到了一點校對工作，少有閒暇。如有，決定星期日上你家。我們可以暢談，我將告訴你一些你想知道的我和老朋友們底生活的近</p>

<p>生活，</p>
<p>有人說你是一條鞭子</p>
<p>我也承認。</p>
<p>我神經裏－有你的吼聲；</p>
<p>我感覺中－有你的創痕。</p>
<p>你要有威力，</p>
<p>懾服了靑年人的氣　；</p>
<p>鈍了青年人的鋒芒</p>
<p>再也不能豪縱；再也不能嘛傲。</p>
<p>因此－</p>
<p>人們也常在咀咒着，怨恨着你無情的驅迫。</p>
<p>但，</p>
<p>這也何嘗不是一種堅鍊？</p>
<p>爲什麼－</p>
<p>我們就不能</p>
<p>將「鞭策」當做了「動力」</p>
<p>去苦幹，硬　幹，實幹！？</p>

<p>－－陰晴，風雨和晦朔。</p>
<p>把筋骨投在自然的爐中鍛鍊。</p>
<p>一句歌兒洗淨混身辛勞，</p>
<p>世界在這裏是無比的單純，</p>
<p>一切憎恨總往脚底裏踹。</p>
<p>綠色的田野舖平一條綫，</p>
<p>千古的生命永遠在蜿蜓。</p>

<p>病</p>
<p>護士小姐坐在掛號間裏，在這個小醫院裏，賬房，掛號……都是她來做。忙的時候要配藥，要幫着打針。每天總要打發去幾十個病人。</p>
<p>從春天到科天，又從冬天到春天，在門前的廊廡上，擁擠着萎枯的病人。年老的·年青的·襤褸的衣衫包裏嶙峋柴骨。失神的眼珠·深陷的臉頰·龜裂的枯手，提醒你：你是在骷　髏羣裏。</p>
<p>一個工科大學生攔從頭再來　醫師訴苦：</p>
<p>二個中年人在絮絮談心：</p>
<p>「每天吃戶口黃豆……」</p>
<p>另一個滿頭是爛疤的工人插嘴道：</p>
<p>「黃豆裏蛋自質很豐當哩；……」他連戶口黃豆也吃不着。</p>
<p>獲土小姐數着鈔票，她想：</p>
<p>「要吃點牛奶鷄蛋才好！」</p>
<p>近中午的時候，碼頭工人同他五歲的小女孩子來看病。護士小姐翻開掛號簿，她說；</p>
<p>「這回你又隔了半個月。」</p>
<p>「工錢一直沒發。」工人感到羞恧，他頰上的紅雲就顯得更鮮艶。</p>
<p>「鈣針要每天注射效力才顯著。」</p>
<p>「反正我這病總不會好！」工人訥然說：「我十八歲就害了這病，那時候總以爲力氣用不竭。二百斤，三百斤的担子挑不動，就拼着命掮起來，壓傷了身子。」</p>
<p>「你沒有錢，儘管來看平凡！」護士說：「我替你向醫師說情，給你免費診治。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你好心的小姐！」工人有點激動：「窮人害了這病就接着了問羅王的催命符，小嫚的媽（他指着他的女孩子）也是害這病，可是她沒吐過一點血。她儘咳嗽，咳嗽……咳得腰氫就祇有一把粗！到底死了。」</p>
<p>護士不忍，不經心「呀」的呌出口來。</p>
<p>碼頭工人接速來了幾天。以後兩天，一星期，半個月……總不見他那藍粗布工裝的影子，帶着沉重的咳嗽，在廊　上出現。許多病人都這樣，來了幾夭，忽然不來了，永久不來了！可是護士小姐還是匆忙地掛號，數鈔票，一大疊的藥方每天越積越高。</p>
<p>「打發不盡的病人，醫不好的病！」她嘆一口氣，翻開掛號薄，又來了幾個新的病人。</p>
<p>拆字</p>
<p>拆字攤座落大街旁。一塊污濁的白布覆在木架上，紙捲插在紙盒子裏，玻璃鏡框裏陳列着價目表。你別笑這設備簡陋，它主人迂腐。這裏是人生哲學的講座，它主人諳悉各階層人物的希望，情慾。悲哀和喜悅。</p>
<p>老先生安詳地坐在木架後，他從近視眼睛裘冷然望着過路人。他那副神氣有點近乎傲慢－－你別嫌我老朽，我可知道你過兩天將有災難。紅色大車子來了又去，軋隆隆揭起了麈埃。老先生從玻璃鏡框子上抹去了一層灰沙，又來一層灰沙。灰沙裏磨減生氣，灰沙裏打發去了大串寂寞的歲月</p>
<p>微風息索，三月春陽烘得他熱辣辣。他用長指甲搔動灰髮，要不是顧慮自已的身份，他真想脫光身子，擦擦戶　。－－爲天氣可真厭人。</p>
<p>從大淸早獃過午时，才有一個中年婦人來光顧。看她的打扮，該是媳姨阿嫂。她的雙手準才洗完衣裳，手指頭個個血紅。</p>
<p>她帶來一封兒子的來信。</p>
<p>「你的兒子很軋實！」老先生脫下眼鏡，他困難地讀了一半，驀地說一句，又重複讀下去：「他說你上决託人帶回鄉去的黑棗，都給帶去的人吃光。下决千萬別再帶吃食回去。」</p>
<p>「拆個字吧？看完信，他問道：「你兒子不是要娶媳婦？一問她坐家命如何？二問她對阿婆利吾？」</p>
<p>阿嫂問問價目，不回答。對於這種勤儉的寡婦你有何辦法？地們一個錢當二個錢用；出了錢看家信，再出錢拆字，別用光了箱子裏的大洋錢。</p>
<p>老先生復從近視眼睛裏冷然望着過路人，擬子冷落又寂寞。三月春陽照着他的老棉襖，照着他的灰髮。一個小學生走過，他躡手躡脚，抽起兩根紙捲。</p>
<p>「我打你道個小流氓！」老先生火起來。</p>
<p>「我不好拆個字相命？」小學生拔脚就逃。</p>
<p>「你的命？你的命還沒抽芽呢！」</p>
<p>攤頭冷落又寂寞，主人厭倦得想睡覺，他想起那個阿嫂，又想起那個頑皮孩子。</p>
<p>「有這末一個孫兒管管攤頭，或者呌一碗陽春麵吃吃多好！」</p>
<p>紅色車子來了又去，灰沙裏打發去一大串寂寞的歲月！</p>

<p>— 必賢</p>
<p>市長盃複賽，東華與僑聯，於昨日下午三時半在逸園重逢，蓋前週〇對〇和局，乃益覺吸人入勝。又以時値初春，風和日咳，於是咸陽路上，紅男綠女，筆者及早趕到，乃見摩肩接踵，先我而去者，何虛萬人。球隊號召力之外，天時亦有關係，誠罕有之盛况。比賽結果，東華先盛後衰，以一對二。一球之差，慘吿敗績。決賽　遂爲義將攫去。在塲觀衆，莫不爲東華惋惜。然一般番將之裏心愉快，自不待贅言矣。從此市長盃決賽者爲滬　與僑聯，盡屬夷人世界，臨書至此，不勝感慨系之。茲叙昨戰戰情，加以評述於後，先列兩軍人馬。</p>
<p>僑聯陣綫</p>
<p>麥尼蒂　羅旭萊西拉蒂　勃利尼奧托尼洛雪維太　迪盤那巴瑪（下）亞托馬利（上）泰克尼鮑傑維拉</p>
<p>東華陣綫</p>
<p>張邦綸　李寗莊友仁　梁樹棠　福楨張林根　李垚孫錦順戴麟　賈幼良陳明哲</p>
<p>上半時各得一球</p>
<p>時間旣屆，執法官玄谷正柱召雙方隊長，戴麟經與鮑傑握手爲禮。擇定方向後，戰局於焉展開。僑聯先攻，即被阻於張林根，東華乘機進製，五鋒挺進，聲勢浩大，爾我之　，默契異常。V字形　小傳遞，妙不可喩。此時皆爲東華天下，義將僅有抵抗之能力耳。惜李垚戴麟經俱在最後關頭失之毫厘。但義軍已胆寒受驚不少。十分鐘時孫錦順截得皮球，越過雪雜太，妙塞空隙地位，李垚心早有領會，及時衝到。不料羅旭萊情急，猛撞李垚，裁判洞若明鑒，照章判罰十二碼球，由孫錦順執刀，鐵腿乃罰十二碼聖手，聲東擊西，麥尼蒂乃爲所算。東華獲此一球，先占上風，聲勢更旺，前鋒五虎，越戰越有勁。旋幼良盤旋而進，高傳對方球門，明哲雖奮身衝上頂進，但越位在前誠屬不幸。十七分鐘幼良單騎直入，迅速如飛，至十五碼處，拉足爲力橫掃出去，球峻急非凡，惜角度太準，乃爲麥所救出。唯以脚頭之硬，麥僅能拍出，豈想抱得住，可見一斑，此亦命也運也。東華不得此球，順境過去，惡運臨頭。二十分鐘時，僑聯久靜思動，亞托尼洛輕交鮑傑，鮑拉起一脚，張林根穩可踢出之球，詎意舉足之間，竟然大意失漏。而邦綸之視綫，亦爲其遮住，泰克尼福至心靈，衝上一脚，球入空門，造成上半時各一之和局。</p>
<p>下半時僑獲一球</p>
<p>下半時，僑聯以亞托馬利之受傷，由巴馬替人。東華全部不動，張邦綸雖右手因撲救有傷，仍負痛應戰。義將賴長力之充沛，銳意圖攻，東華竭盡守禦之道，彼此照顧，絕觧漏洞，唯以對方中衛綫之特强，乃攻勢便大部份操縱於義將脚上。東華亦屢有進攻機會，幼良之兩次讓空擋，其佳妙無出其右。惜阿孫阿戴之打門時，均越逸而去，不勝懊喪，令人氣沮。直至二十分鐘，巴瑪迪盤那　袂並進，張林根忙中逼成角球，迪盤那開來尙　，張林根雖躍起頂着，但球向自已方面，邦綸眼快拍出，又成角球。迪盤那再試妙脚，落點好極，鮑傑人叢中一頂，豈有不入之理。義軍相互擁抱，欣喜之情，無以形容。以後十五分鐘，彼此雖多殺搏演出，東華亦有二次最佳之機會，幼良衝入無人之境，儘可拉門，但弄巧成抽，一撥之間，出脚太重，終至全功盡棄。最後明哲亦有一猛烈之嘗試打鬥，頗有功夫，終爲麥尼蒂接牢，不勝可惜。草草終塲，僑聯以二對一淘汰東華。</p>
<p>東華球藝値得讚美</p>
<p>評東華此戰之敗，在攻勢之盛我而言，亦屬應有此比數。但細察兩球之失，則又盡屬不應失之球。蓋第一球林根如不踢，邦綸亦可及時接接。第二球角球一而再，在氣力長度不逮之中，早料應屬危險之結果，則於角球中失却。論個人，張邦綸之演出，確有最剛著之進境，不能以失球而加罪也。守衛方面，亦有成功，差誤極少。張林根滿塲飛奔之功，殊不可沒。唯所失兩球，俱爲張之過也。前鋒之默契及應用小傳遞進襲，嘆爲觀止，當以幼良爲最出色。返防帶球，問作猛竄，鋒茫畢露。唯終以對方守門麥尼蒂之門難破，功虧一簣耳。我人不能以成敗論英雄，東華此戰，不失萬千球民之殷望</p>
<p>僑聯力足卒獲勝利</p>
<p>至言僑聯方面，余頗難得其最精湛之點，有之，則唯氣力充沛。守門特殊，中衛綫有前呼後應之功夫耳。前鋒綫上，頗少特出。所謂　傳　之優處，偶一見之，中央突破，又少方法。唯其開角球之能力，倒有一半希望，蓋要亦股練之成績。綜觀僑聯旣勝東華，與滬警決鬥，衡其耐能，或不致再造冷門，而獲得本屆之市長盃也。</p>

<p>昨日爲國府還都五周紀念，中國新聞協會上海區分會，得足聯會之後援，特邀請柬亞·西聯兩足球隊，於上午十時，在跑馬應球塲舉行足球比賽，以示慶祝，一律不售門票。球迷爭先恐後，盛極一時。除比賽外，儀式隆重。首先由新協會滬分會理事長陳彬龢致詞，繼由出淵松　二報道部長演說，有海軍音樂隊演奏名曲多支，陳彬龢氏開球後，兩球隊開始比賽。</p>
<p>陳彬龢氏行開球禮</p>
<p>東亞隊以華隊之合羣三省爲主，並有華通之孟義良，及　林隊之松岡西田兩名手。西聯大部爲滬警健將，輔以義將守門台而　卡及德商之雷米迪，雙方實力相彷，而比賽又屬慶祝之意，故彼此踢來客客氣氣。西聯終以聯絡較勝一籌。上半時賴雷米迪。法凡笑之兩射以二對〇領前。下半時東亞隊奮發有爲，雷士萃不負衆望，扳回一球。雙方因開始時間較遲，故比賽時間縮短，每半塲爲二十五分鐘。西聯終以二對一獲勝。</p>

<h3 id="e2">Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department Broadcast Last Night <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - Minister Zhao of the Propaganda Department delivered a radio address from 8:20 PM to 8:50 PM on the 30th, titled "The Peace Movement and the National Revolution." He began by stating that in the five years since the National Government's return to the capital, due to the evolution of the political situation and the expansion of the current situation, national salvation has entered a crucial stage requiring internal peaceful unification and urgent external freedom. He then raised three issues, elaborating on them as follows: First, the essence of the Sino-Japanese peace movement is the re-emergence of the National Revolution. The realization of comprehensive peace is the only savior for turning the entire situation from danger to safety. The future of China and the future of East Asia are entrusted to the peace movement. Second, regarding anti-communism, the Chinese Communist Party, in pursuit of its ambition to seize power, has repeatedly obstructed China's peaceful unification. Since the National Government's return to the capital, it has intensified its efforts, simultaneously advocating a national united front and propagating a bottomless war of resistance, while also expanding its army and vying for territory. Therefore, from a historical perspective, the Chinese Communist Party not only hinders peaceful unification but also constrains the great cause of revival and national construction. Hence, the entire nation should consistently uphold the anti-communist stance. Third, regarding national construction, it cannot be achieved in three to five years. It requires decades or even centuries of effort. Based on past history, countries such as France, the United States, and Japan succeeded only after decades or even hundreds of years of effort. He urged the entire nation to trust the government, uphold the spirit of public service over personal gain, and strive together persistently to succeed.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Wartime People's Representative Conference Holds Closing Ceremony Yesterday, Issues Declaration and Circular Telegram <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Wartime People's Representative Conference of various provinces and cities held its third day of meetings on the 30th, continuing at the National Assembly Hall at 10:00 AM. First, the Secretary-General read the draft declaration of the conference, and the drafters separately read the draft circular telegrams, (1) to various countries and nations of the world, (2) to various nations of East Asia, which were unanimously approved by all present. The Wartime People's Representative Conference of various provinces and cities completed its mission in an enthusiastic atmosphere, and then held the closing ceremony. Chairman Xu Lie delivered the closing remarks, stating: We hope that the government can adopt the resolutions of this conference, but we must not forget that we are the people. We must implement them ourselves. We must start with ourselves in implementing our own resolutions, not rely on others, start from now, and also extend them into the future. Remember that the late Chairman Wang once said that China will surely be saved because China has 400 million undying consciences. Dawn is breaking, and the call for unification has already been shouted. We must bring out our consciences and advance towards a bright future.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Declaration</p>
<p>Considering the increasingly serious situation and the imminent danger to the nation's future, the people of the whole country deeply feel that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation. They urgently need to unite the people, rise up together, and work with the government to overcome difficulties together. Therefore, the people's representatives of various provinces and cities gathered in the capital in a spirit of self-motivation and self-awareness to hold the National Wartime People's Representative Conference of various provinces and cities, to discuss national affairs, fully contribute to the government on the suffering of various localities and the demands of the people, unite all forces, and fight together to win China's freedom and complete domestic unification.</p>
<p>The mission undertaken by the conference is extremely important. It not only seeks fundamental solutions to the various adverse phenomena in the current political, economic, social, and cultural fields, but also discusses countermeasures for various aspects of people's livelihood construction, urges the government to adopt and implement them, and focuses on launching a unified national salvation movement to break the current political deadlock, open up China's future, resolve the general psychological depression of the Chinese people, follow the teachings of the Founding Father, and complete the great cause of the National Revolution. We respectfully present what we believe should be noted in the three aspects of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood in the future, as follows:</p>
<p>Launch a National Salvation Movement</p>
<p>(1) Launching a unified national salvation movement and completing the National Revolution is the only correct goal for saving China. Compatriots across the country should gather all their strength to achieve it. All those who in the past clung to party concepts, class consciousness, and regional prejudices should abandon them and launch a unified national salvation movement under the supreme principle of the nation and the people. The unity of the people should form the unity of political forces, the unity of thought and ideology should promote the unity of action and pace, and then it will be sufficient to build a modern nation and strive for national independence, freedom, and equality. Therefore, we advocate following the teachings of the Founding Father to seek the unity of national ideals, completing national organizations to strengthen national power, and following this path to unite from top to bottom with sincerity and unity to complete the great cause of the National Revolution. We also call on the great powers not to treat China as a battlefield, and especially not to bomb everywhere with airplanes, to preserve the nation's vitality and protect the safety of our compatriots.</p>
<p>Unify National Administration</p>
<p>(2) Unify national administrative institutions and complete national independence and unification as soon as possible. After the National Government returned to the capital, in several regions of the country, on the one hand, due to historical and environmental relations based on the continued accumulation of local habits, it failed to fundamentally clarify the corruption and deterioration of local counter-revolutionary forces with bold and decisive measures. On the other hand, it was affected by the continuing war, avoided treatment, and was subject to many constraints. Therefore, it is necessary to unify the administrative institutions throughout the country and complete national independence and unification as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Freedom of Speech and Assembly</p>
<p>(3) Guarantee the people's freedom of speech and assembly, and establish people's opinion organs at all levels. The Founding Father once showed us the meaning of politics, which is managing the affairs of the people, and those who understand the affairs of the people best are the people themselves. The Republic of China is the republic of the Chinese people. The Founding Father was deeply concerned with cultivating the political power of the people in the Three Principles of the People and the Outline of National Construction. In today's China, whether internally or externally, political power and administrative power need to help each other to overcome difficulties, and the government and the people need to cooperate to advance politics. The government must promulgate laws to guarantee the people's freedom of assembly, and at the same time, central and local governments should establish people's opinion organs at all levels as organizations for the people to gather their forces and express their opinions.</p>
<p>Complete Local Self-Government</p>
<p>(4) Complete local self-government as soon as possible and convene a national assembly after the war. Local self-government is the foundation for the training of democracy. Constitutional government can only be implemented after local self-government is completed. Before the Incident, commentators did not understand and demanded an early end to political tutelage and the implementation of constitutional government. They did not understand the division of the national construction process and wanted to repeat Yuan Shikai's usurpation of the country. The plan for today is to follow the teachings of the Founding Father, complete local self-government as soon as possible as the foundation for the implementation of constitutional government. As for the convening of the National Assembly, although it is an essential plan, at present, the production of representatives of the National Assembly and the election of representatives of the National Assembly in various places have factual difficulties and cannot be done hastily. Even if it is done hastily, it will not be able to represent true public opinion and will instead be used by bureaucrats and politicians as tools for personal political struggles. At present, only various preparatory works for the convening of the National Assembly can be done. After the end of the war, it will be convened and constitutional government will be implemented.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e5">Thoroughly Investigate Speculators Disrupting the Market <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the market situation in this city has once again become chaotic. What is most noteworthy is, first, the weak prices of general non-urgent and non-essential goods, and second, the wild rise in the black market prices of gold and public bonds, and stocks. Regarding the drop in prices, the general drop in prices may seem like a good phenomenon at first glance, but upon actual investigation, the most significant drop is in cosmetics, which have fallen by about 50% compared to the beginning of the year. Other items that have fallen by more than 10% include cigarettes, newspapers, fine cloth, and charcoal. The reasons for the price drops are either due to seasonal factors, the inability to continue hoarding, or the weak purchasing power of citizens, who are not buying at high prices, forcing the goods to be released. It is also due to hoarders selling their goods for cash in order to seek other speculative windfalls. As for daily necessities for ordinary people, especially food, the decline is very slow, or even non-existent, and prices continue to rise. For example, rice only fell by 1% in mid-March compared to early March, flour only fell by 3.6% in the same period, salt rose by 7.7%, and soybean oil also rose by 4.6% (March 24 China Industry Newspaper statistics). There is no reason for optimism about this trend of price increases and decreases. The living pressure on ordinary citizens has not been eased in the slightest, and another social and economic crisis has already extended its more terrifying dark shadow, pressing tightly on every honest citizen.</p>
<p>This dark shadow is the wild surge in gold, public bonds, and stocks. Taking the black market price of gold as an example, if it was 100 in November of last year, it increased by 32.8% in December, 54.6% in January of this year compared to December, and soared again to 122.5 in February compared to January of this year. It increased by 6.3% in early March compared to February, increased again by 10.9% in mid-March compared to early March, and continued to surge wildly in late March, currently exceeding the 5 million mark! In terms of stocks, the popular stock of Wing On Textile Mill rose from 585 yuan at the end of January to 1,820 yuan at the end of March; Commercial Press rose from 18,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan; Kang Yuan Canning rose from 129 yuan to 310 yuan; King Lun Shirt &amp; Socks rose from 24 yuan to 53 yuan; and most of the rest have risen by more than 50%. In addition, the black market for public bonds is also showing a wild upward trend.</p>
<p>Why do we say that this phenomenon of rising prices is a dark shadow threatening the social economy? Because this rise is a reflection of a social and economic crisis, not a normal phenomenon. Gold, public bonds, etc., from an economic standpoint, no longer have a direct relationship with prices. That is, even if prices rise, the price of gold should not skyrocket. Moreover, prices are not rising, so there is absolutely no basis for the price of gold to rise. Its rise is entirely driven by speculation and rumors! As for stocks, we sincerely hope that they have a healthy rise, in order to absorb the excess purchasing power of asset holders and use it as production capital. However, in reality, the recent wild rise is happening at a time when all industries are in decline and production is at a standstill. How can we explain that this rise is helpful for increasing production? In fact, it is the result of the most terrifying speculation, just like the soaring prices of gold and public bonds.</p>
<p>Further research into the creation of this market crisis shows that it was entirely triggered by the Lunar New Year, that is, it began with the enemy's landing on Iwo Jima and the Crimea Conference at that time. Due to the general public's intuitive misjudgment of the war situation, and due to the enemy's strategic propaganda regarding the battlefield and politics, speculators took the opportunity to create rumors and fuel the flames. Some people with floating capital and hoarders were also confused by the speculators' rumors, either directly using their funds or selling off goods that were at risk of being lost under war conditions, exchanging them for cash, and uniformly joining the wave of the crazy market. The result of this blind action cannot but be held responsible for disrupting the social economy and making ordinary citizens suffer the consequences!</p>
<p>Market chaos has never been greater than it is today! And the hardship of life for citizens in the middle and lower classes, and the inability of legitimate industrial and commercial operators to maintain their businesses, has never been greater than it is today! Moreover, market chaos is enough to plunge ordinary citizens and legitimate industrial and commercial businesses into a deeper abyss of suffering, forming a serious social and economic crisis. In this decisive situation, and at a time when the Shanghai municipal administration is gradually getting on the right track, such rumors and speculation cannot be allowed to exist. Not long ago, the Shanghai Branch of the Special Court was established, and it should immediately exert its power of sanction against crimes that endanger the wartime economy. Therefore, we hope that the municipal authorities will pay close attention, thoroughly investigate speculators who disrupt the market, and take decisive and severe measures to curb chaos.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - The National Government has commended sixteen Allied nationals, including Nagano Seiichiro, for their enthusiasm in engaging in education, medicine, charity, and industry, and for benefiting our people. On the fifth anniversary of the return to the capital, it issued an order to grant commendation certificates and bonuses, which has been officially announced by the National Government. The Propaganda Department and the Japanese Embassy have also issued statements on this matter. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Order of the National Government</p>
<p>Order of the National Government, March 30. Since the conclusion of the alliance treaty between China and Japan, the friendship between the two countries has become increasingly consolidated. The nationals of both countries deeply understand the government's policy of friendship and good neighborliness, and have created an atmosphere of mutual support in practical matters, which should be commended. It has been found that sixteen friendly foreign nationals, including Nagano Seiichiro, Seki Masaru, Morishima Fuusa, Maekawa Tankichi, Nishikado Teiichi, Kozuka Jisaku, Takaoka Sozaburo, Kitajima Nando, Higashi Keiji, Watanabe Ryusaku, Imai Shuzo, Kanemoto Mitsuhide, Hirooka Takamasa, Yabe Haru, Komatsu Suzue, and Shibayama Matsue, have engaged in education, medicine, charity, and industry, benefiting our people with their enthusiasm and effectiveness. They are truly meritorious and should be rewarded with high honors. In addition to issuing each of them a certificate of commendation, and awarding each of them a bonus, which will be transferred by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for forwarding to the Japanese Embassy, they are hereby commended. This order is issued.</p>
<p>Praise from the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>The Japanese Embassy issued commendation certificates to the above sixteen people and issued a statement saying: Although the Japanese Embassy in China has already commended nineteen outstanding Japanese residents and two business companies twice, on February 11 and March 8 of last year, for their contributions to the realization of Sino-Japanese friendship, it has now rigorously selected sixteen people from among them, including Nagano Seiichiro, on the anniversary of the return to the capital, and the Ambassador to China has awarded them commendation certificates. Among these individuals are educators, religious figures, and business people, all of whom have thoroughly understood the concept of morality and righteousness in Sino-Japanese friendship. For more than ten years, they have been educating Chinese children, or standing up for medical care in remote and impoverished areas, striving for friendship, and even rescuing many Chinese people under enemy air raids, practicing the principle of shared life and death, and gaining the respect and trust of the Chinese people. The current awardees have all been rigorously selected, and it is inevitable that there are some outstanding individuals who have been overlooked. It is hoped that more and more outstanding residents who thoroughly understand the spirit of morality and righteousness will emerge, embody the fundamental spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, and contribute to strengthening the foundation of cooperation between China and Japan.</p>

<p>Football Match Performance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, in celebration of the National Government Capital Relocation Anniversary, with the support of the Shanghai Football Association, held a football demonstration match at the Racecourse yesterday (30th) morning at 10:00 AM. Chen Binhe, the chairman of the association, and guests including Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, the Army Reporting Department Chief of the Allied Japan Shanghai, Captain Matsushima, the Fleet Reporting Department Chief, and Lieutenant Matsumoto attended. The Japanese Navy Band specially came to the venue to play the national anthems of China and Japan, and played six famous songs including the March for Defending Greater East Asia, the Song of Victory, and the Navy March. The melodies were majestic and the applause thundered. First, Chen Binhe gave a speech, followed by congratulatory speeches by the two chiefs, Izubuchi and Matsushima. The football performance match then began. (For details of the football match, see the sports section of the weekly magazine).</p>
<p>Chen Binhe's Speech</p>
<p>Today is the fifth anniversary of the National Government's Capital Relocation Day. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association is holding a football match to express its congratulations, which has two meanings that can symbolize our direction of effort:</p>
<p>First, we have a goal. The goal of a football match is to score into the opponent's goal. The current goal of the Greater East Asia War is to achieve the liberation of all the nations of Greater East Asia. The enemy, Britain and the United States, used to enslave the nations of Greater East Asia and suck their blood. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, it completely shattered the British and American dream of enslavement and ushered in the dawn of national liberation. The enemy is unwilling to give up its dream of enslavement and is trying to reassert itself with its remaining power. This is a crisis that threatens the survival of all East Asian nations. We must work together with one heart to persist in completing our final goal.</p>
<p>Second, in a football match, each player has a position and communicates with each other, responding to the offense and defense. The people of all countries in East Asia also have positions. Each person should stick to their position, pool their wisdom and efforts, and move towards a common goal together.</p>
<p>Today, we are here to celebrate the National Government Capital Relocation Anniversary. At the same time, in view of the fact that the Greater East Asia War has reached its most tense and decisive stage, we must emulate the striving spirit of football players, stick to our positions, respond in unison, closely communicate, drive out the enemy, and complete the great cause of China's unification and liberation, and complete the great cause of the liberation of the entire East Asian nation.</p>
<p>Today, we are honored to have the Army and Navy Reporting Department Chiefs of the allied countries come to give speeches, expressing their congratulations. We are even more delighted to have the Navy Band of the allied countries come to play, and we would also like to thank all the players participating in the football match.</p>
<p>Celebration Meeting by Three Organizations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association jointly held a celebration meeting at the Great Light Theater at 5:00 PM, and the situation was enthusiastic. Wen Guanting, the chairman of the Citizens' Welfare Association, Yuan Ludeng, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Chen Binhe, the chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the News Association, formed the presidium of the meeting, and invited former Municipal Government Secretary-General Luo and Municipal Propaganda Office Director Liu to give instructions.</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng's Opening Remarks</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng gave the opening remarks, roughly saying: "Today, the three organizations are holding a celebration meeting for the fifth anniversary of the National Government Capital Relocation, and we are very honored to have you all here. What is the significance of our celebration meeting today? We should review it: First, with the cooperation of the allied country Japan, unequal treaties have been abolished and concessions have been recovered. China has embarked on the road of freedom and independence. The long-cherished wish of decades has been realized. How should we work hard to enable China to complete its restoration and construction? Second, China has already joined the war and is standing on the same front with the allied countries, fighting to destroy Britain and the United States. However, the ambitions of Britain and the United States are difficult to contain, and now they are gradually invading East Asia again. How should we attack them so that they will no longer be a scourge to East Asia? Third, in the current stage where the war situation is becoming increasingly tense, the whole country must unite as one, strengthen its will, unify its steps, be diligent and hardworking, brave and vigorous, gather total strength, and contribute to the war. Have we fully done this? We must deeply understand and strive for the above three points. In short, we must step up our efforts, contribute total strength, and move towards the path of restoring China and defending East Asia."</p>
<p>Secretary-General Luo's Instructions</p>
<p>After the speech, Secretary-General Luo was invited to give instructions. The general idea was: "As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves," and "Seek more blessings for yourself." Now that the war has spread all over the world, the people of any country cannot avoid suffering during the war. Because there is suffering, the hope of seeking welfare is even more urgent. Shanghai has organizations such as the Citizens' Welfare Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which all aim to seek the welfare of the citizens. However, because of the result of Britain and the United States enslaving Shanghai for a century, the habit of valuing private interests has been cultivated among the majority of citizens. For example, before the baojia system, there was an attitude among citizens of sweeping the snow in front of their own doors and not caring about the frost on other people's roofs, with very little mutual aid spirit. Now the municipal authorities can guarantee to the citizens that they will never be selfish and will do their best to seek welfare for the citizens. The colleagues in the municipal government are determined to follow the citizens and put the municipal administration on the right track. It can also be said that the authorities lead the citizens to put the municipal administration on the right track. Therefore, putting the municipal administration on the right track is not only the responsibility of the municipal government, but the people also have a common responsibility. Officials and people must work together to achieve the goal. Today, on the anniversary of the National Government Capital Relocation, I would like to put forward two hopes: (1) Citizens must exert themselves to seek welfare. (2) Citizens must enthusiastically participate in organizations that are beneficial to society, and seek the welfare of the entire society through the power of unity, so that personal welfare can also be achieved." Finally, the film "Turning Back is the Shore" was shown, and the meeting did not end until 7:00 PM.</p>

<p>In the Mayor's Cup football quarter-finals, the previous match between Donghua and Qiao Lian resulted in no goals. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, they met again at Yiyuan. As a result, Qiao Lian defeated Donghua by two to one. In the first half, each side scored once. Donghua attacked first. After ten minutes of stalemate, Luo Xulai fouled in the penalty area and was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty. Lao Sun took the shot and scored with one kick. Qiao Lian counterattacked. At the 18th minute, Ottonilo got the ball and sent it far forward. Zhang Lin'gen lost his footing, and Tekni took the opportunity to break in. Bang Lun was unprepared and was poisoned by Tekni, tying the score at one to one. Afterwards, Qiao Lian's offensive was quite strong. Fortunately, Bang Lun's defense was effective. Donghua counterattacked, but unfortunately Qiao Lian had excellent luck and they were all saved by McNitty one by one. After the break, both sides had offensive opportunities, but after Donghua's You Liang missed a sure shot, their momentum gradually weakened. Qiao Lian took the opportunity to break in and created a corner kick for the second time. Di Panna opened the kick for the second time, and Bao Jie headed the ball. Bang Lun made a save, but unfortunately his right hand was injured in the first half, so he failed to catch the ball and it bounced in from the fingertips. Qiao Lian got a late lead of two to one and finally eliminated Donghua.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association held a football performance match at the Racecourse yesterday to celebrate the National Government Capital Relocation Anniversary, and specially invited Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, Chief of the Army Reporting Department of the Allied Japan Shanghai, and Captain Matsushima, Chief of the Fleet Reporting Department, to give speeches one after another. The speeches are recorded in order as follows:</p>
<p>Today, on the occasion of the Capital Relocation Anniversary, I think it is very worthy of celebration. Since the National Government's Capital Relocation, it has begun to establish a national policy of peace and anti-communism and adjust the basic relations between China and Japan. First, the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was established, and then in December of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), the Japanese Empire declared war on Britain and the United States for the purpose of self-defense to maintain stability in East Asia. China and Japan then decided to share joys and sorrows based on the spirit of the Basic Treaty. The National Government then announced its participation in the war, and the relationship between China and Japan became even closer. What is even more noteworthy is that in the third year after the Capital Relocation, the Japanese government returned the exclusive concessions, recognized the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the legation area in Beiping, and abolished extraterritorial rights and returned enemy property. On June 30 of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), the return of the Shanghai concession was completed. In the fifth year, the National Government strived to establish a wartime posture. On November 10 of that year, Chairman Wang passed away, which was a sad thing for the East Asian nation. Today, the East Asian war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, and the arrogant enemy Britain and the United States may land in mainland China and gradually approach the Japanese homeland step by step. However, Japan has made full preparations, and the people of the whole country are implementing total armament, waiting for the enemy to come.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a war that determines the rise and fall of the East Asian nation, not only Japan. If it cannot be won, then the prosperity of the East Asian nation cannot be sought, and the construction of China cannot be completed. I hope that under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, you will follow the three major national policies of maintaining correct thinking, ensuring social order, and increasing production, in order to complete the decisive battle posture and achieve the final victory.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Fighting to the End, Seeking a Bright Future: Speech by Naval Information Director Matsushima <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Today, on the anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, it is a great honor for me to meet with Chinese youths filled with the spirit of national construction and participate in this historic ceremony. I sincerely wish China a boundless future. Since the National Government's return to the capital, five years have passed, during which countless hardships and trials have been overcome. Today, a solid foundation for peaceful national construction has been laid, and it has become the central body for building Greater East Asia, marching forward. This can be entirely attributed to the Chinese predecessors inheriting the will of the national father, Mr. Sun Wen, fully understanding the destiny of Greater East Asia and China's mission. Today, as we recall the past and look to the future, I deeply feel that the responsibility of you young people is even greater.</p>
<p>The War Situation Has Entered the Decisive Stage</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage. Our Japan, in accordance with its established strategy, lures the enemy into our territorial waters to annihilate them. The war situation since March 17th has entered a truly decisive stage. The enemy, the American forces, has concentrated almost all the strength of its Pacific Fleet, engaging in reckless combat. After the battle of Iwo Jima, the enemy's losses were unprecedented in history, with more than half of the 60,000 landing troops being annihilated. Moreover, in the aerial battles in the sea south of the Japanese mainland, the enemy fleet suffered extremely heavy losses. Today, in the Okinawa Islands, the fighting has only been going on for a few days, but the enemy fleet has already lost more than one-third. We do not need to explore the future trends of the enemy's operations, but our mission is only to make the enemy shed a great deal of blood to crush their ambition. What the United States is feeling today is the lack of human resources, so even if they use huge quantities of materials, the day of their failure and setback is not far away.</p>
<p>The Enemy American Strength Is Diminishing Daily</p>
<p>We are making every effort to prevent the Chinese mainland from becoming a battlefield. The current battle in Okinawa is also the prelude to a defensive war.</p>
<p>The enemy American Pacific Fleet, its Third Fleet, was already destroyed and disintegrated before the battle of the Philippines. Now, only the Fifth and Seventh Fleets exist. As the enemy conducts operations, their strength is diminishing daily, and the number of battleships and aircraft carriers is decreasing.</p>
<p>When the battle of the Philippines began last October, the enemy concentrated more than 1,300 ships and over 2,000 aircraft. But by the time of the battle of Iwo Jima in February of this year, the number of ships had been reduced to 600, and the number of aircraft to about 1,000. Currently, in Okinawa, the number of ships has been reduced to about 100, and the number of aircraft is decreasing day by day. Moreover, among the enemy pilots, there are even old men over sixty years old, not wearing socks, and all kinds of impoverished states are endless. Although they try to propagandize, they cannot conceal the fact that the American army is in an extremely difficult situation. We believe that the outcome of the war is determined in the last five minutes, and we must immediately rise up and annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>Sacrifice Everything to Defend the Homeland</p>
<p>China and Japan are the core of Greater East Asia. In order to defend the homeland and achieve independent self-defense, we should spare no sacrifice. Moreover, preventing the enemy from landing in China is to seek the peace and welfare of the Chinese people. We have seen the precedents of Italy and France and cannot but prevent the Chinese mainland from becoming a battlefield.</p>
<p>Enemy propaganda claims that the purpose of landing in China is to end the war and save China. This is completely deceptive. If it becomes a reality, China will be turned into a scorched earth, and the Chinese people will encounter dozens of times more suffering than they do today.</p>
<p>The world is now at a critical juncture of rise and fall. We must fight to the end to fulfill our national mission and seek a bright future and development. Today, on this commemorative day, I hope that you will rise up and work harder to promote the national father's legacy.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Interview with General Yamashita, Commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The enemy's artillery fire and aircraft explosions always occur five or six times a day. In a small house very close to the front line, General Yamashita Tomoyuki, the supreme commander of the Philippine Expeditionary Force, was sitting calmly in a chair. In the general's living room, there was a small round table, two chairs, a teacup, and an ashtray. The general did not want to say anything, but his piercing eyes were fixed on me. "What exactly do you want to ask?" Under these circumstances, I didn't want to ask anything. General Yamashita sat calmly in the chair, as if he bore the weight of a thousand pounds.</p>
<p>"It seems that we can't hear the bombing now. How about taking a short walk outside?"</p>
<p>The general stood up with his cane in his hand, stepping on the fallen leaves. He broke the silence that had lasted for five months since the start of the decisive battle in the Philippines and finally answered the reporter's questions.</p>
<p>Q: Your Excellency once said that the enemy has already penetrated deep into the belly of Japan. What exactly does this mean?</p>
<p>A: Now I can say it. Japan's initial plan was to lure the enemy deep into the plains of Luzon and Manila, and then encircle and annihilate them from all sides. We are operating according to this plan, and it is going very smoothly. The enemy's loss of 70,000 men is the result of this plan. But what we call the early stage of operations is still before the Philippine forces exert their true abilities, the main naval battle is still to come.</p>
<p>Q: However, in the midst of the fierce war, hasn't Japan also suffered great losses?</p>
<p>A: It is really surprising, Japan's losses are very small. Far less than we expected. Charging, this is the work of the suicide squad, and most of these suicide squads have succeeded. With such loyal and patriotic soldiers, is there any reason not to win?</p>
<p>Q: The Japanese in the mainland are all looking forward to the Japanese army in the Philippines launching a major counter-offensive operation. What is your opinion on this?</p>
<p>A: Troops act according to circumstances, and they fight with deception. If an opportunity arises, we will make a big move and carry out a major offensive operation to annihilate the enemy. If there is no opportunity, we will persevere here for ten or twenty years, constantly depleting the enemy's strength, and drag down the enemy's forces as much as possible, so that the enemy has no strength to attack other places. In the near future, we will definitely find an opportunity for a counter-offensive. The current situation is always advantageous. The Japanese army is prepared for any situation, so there is no need to worry unnecessarily.</p>
<p>-The General changed the subject, talking about the country's century-old plan, and emphasizing national salvation through education. The General revealed his usual aspirations, namely, reforming Japanese family education, mother education, and national schools. This is truly amazing.</p>
<p>"What seems far away but is actually near is the problem of education. If the Japanese receive a little better family education, this war may have already been won. But simply having a belief in victory and being very loyal and courageous is not the key to victory. If people in the country think that we have won now, or that we have completely failed, then these people should just focus on their own family education and children's education!"</p>
<p>-General Yamashita is still alive in the Philippines. After a long conversation with the reporter, and then talking about the unrelated topic of education, it made me trust the general even more. (Yoshimura Team Manila Communication) (Translated from the March 10th Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Enemy's Naive Strategy <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese handling plan resolved by the Pacific Problems Research Association in early January was published in mid-February. However, it is now reported that there is another Japanese handling plan drafted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau.</p>
<p>Such a plan is not worth mentioning to us. Just as we continue to study how to concretize the war objectives, the enemy is also simply discussing its objectives, or publishing them. If these kinds of documents are read one by one, nothing can be gained except wasting time. We should use this time to strive for victory. However, in any country, there are always some cowardly people who easily fall for the enemy's naive strategies, and even muddy the domestic atmosphere. Therefore, it is necessary to explain the enemy's intentions regarding the Japanese handling plan.</p>
<p>First, it must be known that the so-called Morgenthau plan is actually just a propaganda strategy. The real Japanese handling plan was written at least in the summer of the year before last, and was presented by the Washington government to its owner, the Wall Street financial clique. At the Cairo talks held at the end of November of the same year, Roosevelt informed Chiang Kai-shek of one end of it. A more precise reflection of the case is the resolution of the Pacific Problems Research Association. Under the premise that the research association is hidden in the so-called non-governmental organization, it disguises the real handling of the Qin Dynasty as American public opinion.</p>
<p>What Morgenthau drafted was a strategy to collapse the cowardly and weak among the Japanese. According to the telegram, it seems that as long as the Japanese abandon their proud attitude as a great nation, the war can be resolved. Here lies the enemy's naive attempt. If unconditional surrender really occurs, the enemy can break their word and implement their real handling plan. Once this kind of naive strategy is explained, it is really worthless, but we must also take care to avoid accidents (translated from the March 8th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e22">Overview of the Situation in the Okinawa Islands <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Okinawa Islands are located in the center of the Ryukyu Islands. The largest island in the islands is Okinawa Island, and there are affiliated islands such as Iheya, Kerama, and Kume, all winding from the north to the southwest. The Kerama Islands, where the enemy landed, are located 25 kilometers west of Okinawa Island and consist of eight islands: Tokashiki, Maedajima, Zamami, Aka, Harejima, Shirafushi, and Irejima. Among these islands, the enemy has already landed on Tokashiki, Zamami, and Aka Islands. Among them, Tokashiki and Zamami are the largest in the Kerama Islands. Tokashiki Island has an area of only 8.5 square kilometers, and Zamami Island has 8 square kilometers. The soil quality of the Kerama Islands is roughly the same as that of Okinawa Island, belonging to volcanic rock and ancient rock. The terrain is extremely steep, the mountains are densely wooded, and there are many deer and other wild animals. However, what the enemy intends is the landing on Okinawa Island. The enemy's deployment of part of its forces on the Kerama Islands is for the purpose of using it as a springboard for invading Okinawa Island. Okinawa Island is 130 kilometers long, 35 kilometers wide at its widest point, and 5 kilometers at its narrowest point. It is a long and narrow island with a circumference of 400 kilometers and an area of 1,211 square kilometers, including all the small islands. Compared with the 20 square kilometers of Iwo Jima, it is 60 times larger. Okinawa Island is located in the center of Japan's southern Kyushu and Taiwan, two major strategic bases, about 500 kilometers apart. The great victory in the air battle off the coast of Taiwan last time was obtained in the east of Taiwan, located between the Japanese mainland and the Philippines. Now, Okinawa Island is located between the Japanese mainland and Taiwan, so it is closer to the radius of action of Japanese aircraft. Japan is in an advantageous position here, and it will be able to inflict heavy damage on the enemy by intercepting the enemy forces.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Explanation of the Rationing System <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The rationing system is an important countermeasure for the wartime economy. In the past, during peacetime, material resources were abundant, life was inexpensive, trade was fair, and every household was self-sufficient, and there was originally no need for rationing. Since the incident in our country, due to the war, production has decreased and material resources have gradually become scarce. As a result, those with financial resources manipulate and hoard goods for profit, and the livelihoods of ordinary people have been greatly threatened, arousing market unrest. In order to stabilize people's livelihood, the government created the rationing system.</p>
<p>The implementation of the rationing system in our country is still in its initial stage, and especially in Shanghai, the scope is the largest and the most complex. After more than two years of efforts by the authorities, the rationing of goods in Shanghai has roughly taken shape. However, due to the complex situation, the public's failure to fully understand the meaning of rationing, and the lack of sources of materials, it has not been able to achieve fully satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The original purpose of the goods rationing system was to enable the public to obtain daily necessities at a low price to maintain their lives, and the items obtained should be equal, which is in line with the original purpose of rationing. However, in this society where people's hearts are not ancient, cunning people always use the rationing relationship to falsely report household names, or falsely increase the population, and one person receives several copies of rationing items and other kinds of abuses. Because the city has millions of people, it is very difficult to find out the truth unless someone understands the situation and reports it to the rationing agency. This point is the most difficult for rationing agencies to handle. Therefore, we hope that the people will check themselves and no longer have this kind of behavior. Those who have a small number of bad elements who still follow the old ways should be reported by the public as a public enemy. Because consuming one more share of rationing resources reduces the rationing benefits of the real citizens by one share. In order to maintain their own interests, the citizens should work together with the officials.</p>
<p>The rationing items are mainly daily necessities, such as rice, flour, coal balls, matches, and soap. In recent years, due to reduced production, lack of raw materials, and transportation difficulties, the output cannot meet the demand, and the cost has increased. Therefore, household rationing cannot be distributed on time, and even special rationing is inevitably delayed. This is a matter of fact and there is nothing to be done about it. The office is now making every effort to coordinate with the relevant parties to obtain a smooth outcome, so that the amount of rationing goods is increased, in order to live up to the expectations of the citizens.</p>
<p>It has been almost three months since I took office. I have been reviewing the rationing policy and carrying out the affairs day and night. I hope that I can work together with the citizens of the city to study and improve the situation, so as to achieve the effect of cooperation. I hope that you will give me assistance at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Protecting Air-raid Shelters by Fan Jinquan <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>In the event of a bombing, an air-raid shelter is where we avoid disaster and preserve our lives. Therefore, we should protect the air-raid shelters well to prevent damage, so as to avoid difficulties when we need to use them urgently.</p>
<p>There are several points offered for preventing damage to air-raid shelters, and I hope that the authorities and Baojia people will pay attention to them and promote them:</p>
<p>(1) Most of the current air-raid shelters are dug in the mud, or bamboo frames are built on them, and then covered with mud, so they are very easy to damage. Self-defense team posts should be set up near the air-raid shelters to monitor and prevent the unintentional destruction by passersby or children climbing them.</p>
<p>(2) Air-raid shelters should be locked at ordinary times to prevent people from dumping garbage, which would become a place to hide dirt and breed filth, and children from using them as playgrounds.</p>
<p>(3) Air-raid shelters should be covered to prevent rainwater from flowing in during rainy days, which would become a breeding ground for germs and mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The construction of air-raid shelters has become quite common thanks to the efforts of the authorities. But if calculated by population, there are still not enough. We should work hard to speed up the construction. When there is not yet enough average distribution, we must cherish the existing air-raid shelters and not allow them to be damaged.</p>
<h3 id="e25">A Glimpse into the Rationing of Goods (1) - Liu Yuwu <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The rationing system for goods in Shanghai originated in May of the 30th year of the Republic of China [1941]. At that time, there was a panic over rice, and the old Public Works Department commissioned Jardine Matheson and Ewo to order foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai, and rice shops registered to receive and supply it to the general public.</p>
<p>After June of the 30th year [1941], prices in Shanghai suddenly rose. In order to control the main materials for people's food, the old Public Works Department added a price investigation section in the General Affairs Bureau. Two years later, the section was changed to the Materials Control Department, and soon after to the Materials Control Bureau. Its main task was to control prices and report profiteers. The organization was divided into six sections, namely general affairs, rationing, procurement, guild, investigation and execution, and original price calculation. Mr. Inagaki Noboru served as the director, and there were about 600 Chinese and foreign staff below him.</p>
<p>In August of the 32nd year [1943], the concessions were recovered, and after the establishment of the First District Public Office, the Materials Control Bureau was changed to the Economic Affairs Department. At this time, it handled all the rationing administration of the old one and eight districts and the newly merged district of western Shanghai. The first director was Mr. Chen Riping, who was later succeeded by Feng You. Its internal organization was then changed to five sections, namely general affairs, material procurement rationing, price, industrial and commercial management, and finance.</p>
<p>In mid-August of the 33rd year [1944], the Economic Affairs Department and the Food Bureau were ordered to be abolished. Taking the Food Bureau as the main body, a Goods Rationing Office was organized within the Municipal Government. Mr. Feng You served as the director. Except for Mr. Hirano Osamu, a Japanese staff member, who served as an advisor, and Mr. Fukuda Toshirou, who served as a commissioner, the rest were all local staff.</p>
<p>At the beginning of January of this year, the Municipal Government was reorganized, and Mr. Liu Xingchen took over as the director of the Goods Rationing Office, and continued to handle the wartime economic administration of all rationing materials in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Types and Sources of Rationed Goods</p>
<p>Now, the main rationed materials in Shanghai will be classified and described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Rice and Flour - In the past, the quantity of rice and flour rationed was approved by the Food Adjustment Committee (the Director of the Food Box Bureau was the chairman of the committee). Rice was purchased by the Rationing Office from the Rice Control Committee, and flour was supplied by the Shanghai District Flour and Wheat Bran Distribution Office. The quantity and price were approved by the committee.</p>
<p>(2) Cooking Oil - The quantity and price of this rationed item were approved by the Oil Grain Professional Committee, and then supplied and sold by the Cooking Oil Distribution Office.</p>
<p>(3) Sugar - After this rationed item was approved, it was supplied by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office. The quantity and price were approved by both parties.</p>
<p>(4) Coal Balls - This raw material was delivered by the Rationing Office, after consultation and approval, ordering the Coal Association to deliver it to the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company to allocate it to the designated coal ball factories for production. The quantity and price were approved by the relevant parties from time to time.</p>
<p>(5) Matches - This material was supplied by the Shanghai Match Association, and the quantity and price were approved by the relevant authorities and the association.</p>
<p>(6) Soap - This material was supplied and rationed by signing contracts with six factories, namely Wuzhou Pharmacy Gu Ben Soap Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, Da Xin Hua Meng Factory, Mingxing Perfume Soap Factory, Henry Soap Candle Alkali Factory, and Japan Oil and Fat Company.</p>
<p>(7) Artificial Butter - This material was purchased by the Rationing Office from the China Edible Oil Company after consultation and approval with the relevant authorities. The price was jointly approved by the three parties, and it was specially for those who rationed bread.</p>
<p>In addition to the above seven rationed materials, there are also rations for milk, salt, and coal, (milk is still rationed, and there is no unified plan for salt and coal.)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Short Notes <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Lin</p>
<p>You sent a letter, writing:</p>
<p>"Has your school started its holiday? As for me, I really hope for a short break to rest, to read some books I want to read, to visit friends I want to see... but it's always impossible. I go out early every morning, the cold chills me to the bone, and I return late at night, still having to walk. All I'm asking for is to keep a barely surviving job with a salary that is so meager, what good is it? I'm gradually starting to feel that people like me are the most unfortunate in society. My dear friend, even though you are studying hard, it's still better than me. At least you still have the passion to pursue your ideals. I hope you can hold onto your school life. Once you enter society, all hope will be shattered – unless you can escape the shackles of life alone and regain a free life!"</p>
<p>Life constricts us too tightly. Even while studying, my mind is as preoccupied as yours with the question: "How to survive?" School is not a circle isolated from society. You hope I won't abandon my school life, saying that during school "there's passion to pursue ideals." Aren't you just trying to extract a bit of warmth from your memories? You once wrote: "...I'm chewing over my past again, and everything from the past seems even sweeter." Look at all the changes over these past two years, even in yourself. I guess you must feel lonely now. Loneliness can make a person melancholy. If you can be with many friends like you were in school, or even just a few close friends, you will reignite your passion. Under the heavy weight of life, the wrinkles on the soul are hard to erase. It must be difficult for you to arrange your thoughts. Perhaps the "reunion" version of your friends and you merging together is exactly a portrait of yourself, depicting the contradictions in your thinking. You once hated the city, so do you love the countryside? You yourself know that the countryside, like the city, has social knots intertwined. Perhaps the people in the countryside are more simple and frugal, but the farmers in the countryside now are no longer frugal and simple. They have become quite crafty, even cunning. As for those other "silently struggling poor farmers," would they still bring you hope? The hometown and tranquil life in your memory are absolutely another scene, a beautiful illusion. If you go back to the countryside, you will be disappointed, not only doubting your ideals but also lacking the courage to pursue them.</p>
<p>I must reiterate, you are in a state of loneliness; you have not been swept into the turbid currents of society, you are steadfast. And in fact, you have no way to intervene in the group around you. Because of loneliness, you become melancholic. You only see your own life and family – forgive me for being too blunt. Thus, you sigh, thinking you are the most unfortunate person in the world. Life requires courage, and only life can give you this courage. Hard work should not diminish your courage to pursue ideals. Nostalgia is only a shackle for us. If that comfort is illusory, we will discard it. Without comfort, are we unable to persist in hard work!</p>
<p>You might as well "escape the shackles of life alone and regain a free life." I don't know what your "life" refers to. If it refers to the misery of life, it seems understandable. I believe you certainly don't have the idea of transcending the mundane world, but the tone and meaning of your words make it feel a little too romantic. Do you feel it? We should have confidence, and have some small poems to maintain this confidence, often mentioning the black night.</p>
<p>I really didn't expect to write so much. We have too few opportunities to meet these days. Recently, I found some proofreading work, and I have little free time. If I do, I'll decide to go to your house on Sunday. We can talk freely, and I'll tell you some recent news about my life and the lives of my old friends that you want to know.</p>

<p>— Shen Jianying</p>
<p>Life,</p>
<p>Some say you are a whip,</p>
<p>I also admit it.</p>
<p>In my nerves – there is your roar;</p>
<p>In my senses – there is your scar.</p>
<p>You want to have power,</p>
<p>Subdue the spirit of young people;</p>
<p>Dullen the sharp edge of young people,</p>
<p>No more extravagance; no more arrogance.</p>
<p>Therefore –</p>
<p>People often curse, resenting your ruthless driving.</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>Isn't this also a kind of tempering?</p>
<p>Why –</p>
<p>Can't we</p>
<p>Treat "whipping" as "motivation"</p>
<p>To work hard, force hard, and truly do!</p>

<p>— Shi Di</p>
<p>One shoulder pushes open the surging spray,</p>
<p>One rope holds back a river of wind;</p>
<p>A riverside camel is no different from a desert,</p>
<p>Still carrying endless,</p>
<p>— sunshine, rain and waxing and waning moons.</p>
<p>Casting muscles and bones into nature's furnace for forging.</p>
<p>A song washes away all the toil,</p>
<p>The world here is incomparably simple,</p>
<p>All hatred is always trampled underfoot.</p>
<p>Green fields spread a line,</p>
<p>The ancient life is forever winding.</p>
<p>Thickened heels crush the roots of the grass,</p>
<p>Preferring a myriad of sweat drops to be dried by the river wind.</p>

<p>— Ke Qun</p>
<p>Illness</p>
<p>The nurse sits in the registration room, in this small hospital, she does the accounting, registration... all by herself. When busy, she has to dispense medicine and help with injections. Every day, she has to deal with dozens of patients.</p>
<p>From spring to autumn, and from winter to spring again, withered patients crowd the porch in front. Old, young, tattered clothes wrapped around gaunt bones. Lost eyes, sunken cheeks, cracked dry hands, remind you: you are in a group of skeletons.</p>
<p>A engineering university student intercepts and tells the doctor his troubles:</p>
<p>Two middle-aged people are chatting:</p>
<p>"Every day eating household registration soybeans..."</p>
<p>Another worker with a head full of sores interjects:</p>
<p>"Soybeans in the household registration are very rich in protein;..." He can't even get household registration soybeans to eat.</p>
<p>The nurse is counting banknotes, she thinks:</p>
<p>"It would be good to eat some milk and eggs!"</p>
<p>Near noon, a dockworker comes to see the doctor with his five-year-old daughter. The nurse opens the registration book, she says:</p>
<p>"You're half a month late this time."</p>
<p>"The wages haven't been paid." The worker feels ashamed, and the red cloud on his cheeks becomes even more vibrant.</p>
<p>"Calcium injections need to be injected every day to be effective."</p>
<p>"Anyway, my illness will never get better!" The worker says in a dull voice: "I've had this illness since I was eighteen years old. At that time, I always thought my strength was inexhaustible. If I couldn't carry loads of two hundred or three hundred catties, I would risk my life to carry them on my shoulders, injuring my body."</p>
<p>"If you don't have money, just come to see him!" The nurse says: "I'll intercede with the doctor for you, and give you free treatment."</p>
<p>"Thank you, kind lady!" The worker is a little excited: "When poor people get this disease, they receive the death warrant from King Yama. The little girl's mother (he points to his daughter) also had this disease, but she never vomited any blood. She just coughed, coughed... coughed until her waist was only as thick as a grip! In the end, she died."</p>
<p>The nurse couldn't bear it, and unintentionally exclaimed "Ah!".</p>
<p>The dockworker came quickly for a few days. After two days, a week, half a month... you never see the shadow of his blue coarse cloth work clothes, with a heavy cough, appearing on the porch. Many patients are like this, they come for a few days, and suddenly they don't come anymore, they never come again! But the nurse is still busy registering, counting banknotes, and a large stack of prescriptions piles higher and higher every day.</p>
<p>"Endless patients, incurable diseases!" She sighs, opens the registration book, and several new patients have come again.</p>
<p>Character Dissection</p>
<p>The character dissection stall is located next to the street. A dirty white cloth covers the wooden frame, paper scrolls are inserted in paper boxes, and a price list is displayed in a glass frame. Don't laugh at this simple equipment, its owner is pedantic. This is a lecture on the philosophy of life, its owner is familiar with the hopes, desires, sorrows and joys of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>The old man sits peacefully behind the wooden frame, coldly watching passers-by through his nearsighted eyes. His expression is somewhat arrogant – don't dislike me for being old and decaying, I know you will have disasters in a couple of days. Red cars come and go, rumbling and kicking up dust. The old man wipes a layer of dust from the glass frame, and then another layer of dust. Life force is worn down in the dust, and long strings of lonely years are passed in the dust.</p>
<p>The breeze whispers, and the March sun warms him hotly. He scratches his gray hair with his long fingernails. If he wasn't concerned about his status, he really wants to take off his clothes and wipe himself. --Because the weather is really annoying.</p>
<p>He had been in a daze from early morning until noon, when a middle-aged woman came to patronize. Judging by her dress, she should be a daughter-in-law or sister-in-law. Her hands must have just finished washing clothes, and her fingers were all blood red.</p>
<p>She brings a letter from her son.</p>
<p>"Your son is very practical!" The old man took off his glasses, read half of it with difficulty, and suddenly said a sentence, and then repeated reading it: "He said that the black dates you entrusted to someone to bring back to the hometown were all eaten by the person who took them. Next time, never bring food back."</p>
<p>"Dissect a character, shall we?" He asked after reading the letter: "Isn't your son going to marry a wife? First ask what her household's fate is? Second ask if she will be beneficial to her mother-in-law?"</p>
<p>The sister-in-law asked about the prices, but did not answer. What can you do with this kind of frugal widow? They use one penny as two pennies; spending money to look at a family letter, and then spending money to dissect a character, will use up the silver dollars in the box.</p>
<p>The old man coldly looks at passers-by again through his nearsighted eyes, the stall is cold and lonely. The March sun shines on his old cotton-padded jacket, shining on his gray hair. An elementary school student walks by, tiptoeing and pulling out two paper scrolls.</p>
<p>"I'll beat you, you little hooligan!" The old man got angry.</p>
<p>"Can't I dissect a character for fortune telling?" The elementary school student took off and ran.</p>
<p>"Your fate? Your fate hasn't sprouted yet!"</p>
<p>The stall is cold and lonely, and the owner is tired and wants to sleep. He thinks of that sister-in-law, and thinks of that naughty child.</p>
<p>"How nice it would be to have such a grandson to manage the stall, or to call for a bowl of plain noodles to eat!"</p>
<p>Red cars come and go, and long strings of lonely years are passed in the dust!</p>

<h3 id="e30">Review of the Municipal Mayor's Cup Football Re-election: Overseas Chinese Federation Eliminates the Tung Wah Game <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Xian</p>
<p>In the Municipal Mayor's Cup re-election, Tung Wah and the Overseas Chinese Federation met again in Yiyuan at 3:30 yesterday afternoon. Since the previous match ended in a 0-0 draw, it felt even more captivating. Moreover, since it was early spring and the weather was fine, red men and green women were on Xianyang Road, and when I arrived early, I saw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, and those who went before me, there must have been tens of thousands. In addition to the appeal of the football team, the weather also had a relationship, truly a rare grand occasion. As a result of the competition, Tung Wah flourished first and then declined, with a score of one to two, one goal short, suffering a terrible defeat. The final competition was taken by the Righteous Generals. The audience at the scene all regretted Tung Wah. However, the general enthusiasm of the foreign generals, goes without saying. From then on, the Municipal Mayor's Cup final will be a world of foreigners, with the Shanghai Police and the Overseas Chinese Federation. As I write this, I cannot help but feel emotional. Now I will describe the battle situation yesterday and add a review. First, I will list the personnel of the two armies.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation Lineup</p>
<p>McNitty, Luo Xulai, Xiladi, Boli Niotoni, Luo Xueweitai, Dipanna Bama (down), Yatuo Mali (up), Taike Ni Bao Jie Weila</p>
<p>Tung Wah Lineup</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun, Li Ning Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Fu Zhen Zhang Lingen, Li Yao Sun Jinshun Dai Lin, Jia Youliang Chen Mingzhe</p>
<p>One goal each in the first half</p>
<p>When the time came, the law enforcement officer Xuan Gu Zhengzhu summoned the captains of both sides. Dai Lin shook hands with Bao Jie as a courtesy. After choosing the direction, the battle began. The Overseas Chinese Federation attacked first, but was blocked by Zhang Lingen. Tung Wah took the opportunity to counterattack, and the five forwards advanced, with great momentum, and the tacit understanding between each other was extraordinary. The V-shaped transmission was wonderful and incomparable. At this time, everything was Tung Wah's world, and the Righteous Generals only had the ability to resist. Unfortunately, both Li Yao and Dai Lin lost by a hair in the final moment. But the Righteous Army was frightened and surprised a lot. At ten minutes, Sun Jinshun intercepted the ball, passed Xuewei Tai, and cleverly blocked the gap, Li Yao had already understood in his heart, and rushed in in time. Unexpectedly, Luo Xulai was anxious and slammed into Li Yao. The referee saw everything clearly and penalized a twelve-yard ball according to the rules, which was taken by Sun Jinshun. The iron legs were the holy hand of the twelve-yard penalty, attacking the east and striking the west, and McNitty was calculated. Tung Wah won this goal, took the lead, and the momentum was even stronger. The five tigers in the front became more and more energetic as they fought. Then Youliang circled and advanced, high pass to the opponent's goal, Mingzhe rushed up and headed in with all his might, but it was a pity that he was offside. At seventeen minutes, Youliang rode alone straight in, as fast as flying, and at fifteen yards, he pulled back and swept out with all his strength. The ball was extremely fast, but the angle was too accurate, and it was saved by Mai. Only by the hardness of the foot, Mai could only pat it out, how could he want to hold it, which can be seen in general, this is also fate and luck. Tung Wah did not get this ball, the good times passed, and bad luck came. At twenty minutes, the Overseas Chinese Federation moved after a long silence. Yatuo Nilo lightly passed to Bao Jie, Bao pulled up a kick, Zhang Lingen steadily kicked out the ball, unexpectedly, between the feet, he actually lost it carelessly. And Banglun's line of sight was also blocked by him, and Taike Ni came to his mind, rushed up with a kick, and the ball entered the empty goal, creating a 1-1 draw in the first half.</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation scored one goal in the second half</p>
<p>In the second half, the Overseas Chinese Federation replaced Yatuo Mali due to his injury. Tung Wah did not move at all. Although Zhang Banglun's right hand was injured from saving the ball, he still fought through the pain. The Righteous Generals relied on their abundant stamina and were determined to attack. Tung Wah exhausted their defensive efforts, taking care of each other and never leaking loopholes. However, due to the special strength of the opponent's central defense line, the offensive was mostly controlled by the feet of the Righteous Generals. Tung Wah also had many offensive opportunities, and Youliang's two allowances for space were unparalleled. Unfortunately, when Sun and Dai shot, they both went beyond, and they were very disappointed, which made people discouraged. Until twenty minutes, Bama Di Pan named Mei and Jin, Zhang Lingen was forced into a corner kick in a hurry. Di Pan named it very well, Zhang Lingen jumped up and headed it, but the ball was towards his own side, Banglun quickly patted it out, and it became a corner kick again. Di Pan named it again with wonderful feet, the landing point was extremely good, and Bao Jie headed it in the crowd, how could it not go in. The Righteous Army hugged each other, and their joy was indescribable. In the next fifteen minutes, although there were many killings and performances, Tung Wah also had two best opportunities. Youliang rushed into no man's land, and he could pull the door, but he was clever and became clumsy. With a flick, his foot was too heavy, and he ended up abandoning all his efforts. Finally, Mingzhe also made a fierce attempt to fight, which was quite skilled, but in the end, it was firmly caught by McNitty, which was a pity. Hastily ended, the Overseas Chinese Federation eliminated Tung Wah with a score of two to one.</p>
<p>Tung Wah's football skills are worthy of praise</p>
<p>Judging from the defeat of Tung Wah in this battle, it was supposed to have this score in terms of the strength of the offensive. But if you look closely at the loss of the two goals, they were all goals that should not have been lost. If Lin Gen didn't kick the first goal, Banglun could have caught it in time. The second goal was a corner kick again and again. When the strength and length were insufficient, it was expected that it would be a dangerous result. The loss of the corner kick. In terms of individuals, Zhang Banglun's performance has indeed made the most outstanding progress, and he cannot be blamed for the loss of the goal. In terms of defense, there was also success, with very few errors. Zhang Lingen's full court running is indispensable. However, the two goals lost were both Zhang's fault. The tacit understanding of the forwards and the application of small transmissions to attack is amazing, and Youliang is the most outstanding. Returning to defense and dribbling the ball, rushing forward fiercely, his edge is fully revealed. However, in the end, the opponent's goalkeeper McNitty's goal was difficult to break, and all his efforts were in vain. We cannot judge heroes by success or failure. Tung Wah's battle did not fail the expectations of thousands of fans</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation won the victory due to its strength</p>
<p>As for the Overseas Chinese Federation, it is difficult for me to find its most exquisite point. If there is one, it is only that it has abundant energy. The goalkeeper is special, and the central defense line has the skill of echoing each other. On the front line, there are very few outstanding players. The advantages of "transmission" and "transmission" are occasionally seen, and there are few methods for central breakthroughs. However, its ability to open corner kicks has half the hope, and it is also the result of stock training. Overall, since the Overseas Chinese Federation has defeated Tung Wah and fought the Shanghai Police, judging from its endurance, it may not create another upset and win this year's Municipal Mayor's Cup.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital, the East Asia and West Union Football Match <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese News Association, with the support of the Football Association, specially invited the East Asia and West Union football teams to hold a football match at the Horse Racing Stadium at 10 am to celebrate. Tickets were not sold at all. Fans rushed to be the first to get in, and it was a very grand occasion. In addition to the competition, the ceremony was grand. First, Chen Binhe, the director of the Shanghai Branch of the New Association, delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Izumi Matsuji, the director of the Reporting Department. The navy music team played many famous songs. After Chen Binhe kicked off the ball, the two teams began the competition.</p>
<p>Chen Binhe kicked off</p>
<p>The East Asia team was mainly composed of the Chinese teams Hequn and Sansheng, and also included Meng Yiliang of the Huatong team, and two famous players, Matsuoka and Nishida, of the Qiulin team. The West Union was mostly composed of Shanghai Police athletes, supplemented by Italian goalkeeper Taiwan Erka and German merchant Remy Di. The strength of both sides was similar, and the competition was also meant to be a celebration, so they kicked very politely. The West Union was better in terms of contact. In the first half, Remy Di and Fafan Xiao scored two goals to lead 2-0. In the second half, the East Asia team worked hard and made progress. Lei Shicui lived up to expectations and pulled back a goal. Because the starting time was later, the competition time was shortened, with each half lasting twenty-five minutes. The West Union finally won 2-1.</p>
