<h3>洛勒爾偕隨員訪日協議現階段施策對日本支援表示濃厚謝意</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電</p>
<p>菲總統洛勒爾，此次為與日政府協議起見，偕同阿基諾國會議長，與西阿斯教育部長，與阿斯軍事顧問，加舉平商土部長來訪日本，日情報局特於一日發表如次：天皇陛下業與上月二十八日賜見洛勒爾總統，洛勒爾此次來該之目的，鑒於戰局之現階段，因就各項施策與日政府協議。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電</p>
<p>菲律賓大總統洛勒爾，二十七日夜七時十六分抵達新橋車站，進宿舍帝國飯店，一日上午七時半，由新橋車站出發，離開東京，滯留東京時之日程如下：二十八日上午九時五十分晋宮拜謁，十一時半訪問首相官邸，與鈴木首相會見，下午四時於貴族院會見東鄉外相兼大東亞相，六時出席外相於帝國飯店招待之晚餐會。二十九日上午八　時三十分，於海軍省與米內海相，　田軍令部總長會談，十時赴陸軍省阿南陸相，梅津參謀總長重要會談。三十日上午九時二十分參拜明治神宮，十時十分參拜騎乘靖國神社，下午六時出席菲大使伐爾加斯於大使館招待之晚餐會。</p>
<h3>發表訪日聲明</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　菲總統洛勒爾此次來訪日本之際，會發表聲明如次：約在一年前，因日政府對於菲律賓共和國之独立及獲得各國之承認，會予以絕大之支援，為將菲律賓國政府及國民之深厚謝意奏達日天皇陛下暨傳達日政府起見，　會派遣達禮使節訪問日本，茲者，予等一行鑒於當前之戰局，關於發生各問題，為與日政府協議，而有此次來訪。予對於日政府之海涵包容及深厚之盛意，今得藉機以菲律賓共和國大總統之資格親來道謝，引為無上這欣幸。予暨予等一行，承天皇陛下躬予賜見，感愧良深，天皇陛下賜予之激動語，久銘記不忘。予又對於總理大臣閣下，其他各位大臣閣下暨日本指導者各位之衷心歡待及理解，亦表明不勝感謝。當茲　軍之情勢下，予深信不僅菲律賓共和國，即構成大東亞之諸國民及世界各地被壓迫民族，終將達到自由及独立也。</p>
<h3>日在本土決戰絕對優越性發揮總力最大之機能</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電吾人試回頭敵軍既往後攻作戰經過情形，當可知彼等認為推進基地之目的既已貫徹，則不待陸上戰爭終了，即移指新目標，此為美軍不變之戰略。因此，沖繩作戰以後，敵軍所采取之戰略，究為何者，想不外推進基地，或展開中國大陸登陸戰，或直攻日本本土三種，然無論如何，敵軍必先强化空襲爆炸，並强行封鎖海岸，不容否認，　沖繩陸上戰爭終了，已轉入新階段故也。</p>
<p>最後勝利之國民戰</p>
<p>日本土決戰乃為最後之決戰，換言這，即日本國家存亡繼續開頭之決戰，亦即日本之自存自行作戰，故吾等不得不毅然奮起，以突破一切前途障礙。大東亞各地戰爭，對保衛日本國土，切切相關，此皆不容食言，日本土之戰爭，非僅為軍隊作戰之戰爭，實系一億國民為保衛國　與死守國土而團結一致，爭取最後勝利之國民戰爭，此為最大之特　。本土決戰更無前線與後方之區别，一億國民均繼精强無匹皇軍之後，擔當生產兵，檢送兵，通信兵，而從事戰爭，因此，國民義勇隊及國民戰爭隊有重大之存大意義。敵空軍最近來襲頻繁，對各地滥施轟炸，不外企圖切斷日本土與南方及中國大陸之連絡，使日本經濟陷於孤立，或作思想謀之略宣傳耳。</p>
<p>沖繩教訓充分發揮</p>
<p>敵美戰爭指導者，亦深知日本非能隆伏之民族，彼等為完成其毁灰日本之大目的，最後於日本土旅行登陸，與日軍作孤注一擲之戰，至為明　，敵美此種野心，不独特魯曼已言之，然一觀此次戰爭之本質，亦可知乃必然之歸趨，但吾人亦早充分料及故軍此種企圖，深知在本土決戰，實為決定今後吾人存亡絕續之命運，一億國民均有敵氣同仇之壯志，期將悍然登陸之敵一舉戰來頭，而獲得最後勝利。若是，吾人於展開本土決戰時，果當如何擊毁敵力，簡而言之，本土決戰，與前此之跳島作戰完全不同，前者，展開跳島作戰時，敵軍采取攻勢，而我方僅出以防襲態度耳，此次則為我方對敵軍之攻勢，吾人亦加以攻擊，對敵軍采取主　　，吾人亦奪取主異權，換言之，吾等須知，本土決戰乃最後之決歸，而沖繩作戰所獲之各種教訓及暗示，今後自當充分發揮，假使敵軍企圖使出，則我方陸，海軍決不待敵軍使出後始行，阿南陸相日前於臨時義會席上亦會聲明。敵軍如來侵攻本土，則我方先於海上以航空部隊及艦艇，尤以特攻部隊加以猛攻，將其擊滅，更於海邊以空軍及水上特攻隊並海岸炮施以攻擊，各敵軍猶能僥幸强行登陸，則日本將以精强之野戰軍，將其全軍擊滅。若就本土決戰之戰術上絕對優越性及必勝性約有如下各點：</p>
<p>精銳兵力全部運用</p>
<p>日軍力估絕對優勢，自加運卡納爾作戰以來，於島嶼作戰中，日軍會孤立無援，不得不以所在戰力抵抗絕對優勢之敵軍集中攻擊，然於本土決戰，則完全相反。對遠渡太平洋進攻日本土這敵軍，日方准備萬全，當能以精强兵力繼續不斷攻擊，美大總統特曼會爾，對日作戰將動員七百萬兵力，此不外為敵方奸濃之謀略宣傳，期以此數字之壓力眩惑日本國民，吾人由是更可窺知，敵方現正焦慮補給線之延長及運極艦船之不足，反之，日本可無此變。觀於阿南陸相所指爾，（現正擁有精强之陸軍兵力數百餘萬）可知矣。又據前次施行（義勇兵役法）而編成之國民義勇戰團隊，專為擔任後方勤務，此乃本土決戰時之優越性，於本土以外各地展開戰　時，後方勤務亦多由軍隊分擔，然在本土決戰，此種重要之後方勤務，即將由戰　隊擔任之，故爾　軍隊悉可調往前線，自可將全部兵力運用，此為本土戰之絕對優越性。</p>
<p>地利確保增援補給</p>
<p>本土之地利，當屬於我方，作戰時，必須　　戰場之地形地物，蓋因本土決戰時，山嶽，河川，森林，道路，因不待論，即一草一木，俱可使之成戰力化，利用地形地物，皆為內線不可或缺之機動力，若能發揮其至最高度，可對敵優勢大軍加以集中攻擊，使日陸傳統之機動力發揮無遺，自日美戰爭以來之空前未有之野戰，將敵包圍消滅。又回頭前跳島作戰時，日本感最困難者，莫如補給力，此種現　勢必轉移至敵人身上。吾人於戰場即兵站基地之極有利之立場上，則雛形時後器，彈藥，食糧等之消耗，俱可能依時充分補給前線，雖敵軍欲期澈底空襲　炸鐵道通信等交通線及破壞橋梁，乃意中事，然重要交通線破壞之恢复資材，現均已准備。又萬一恢复發生困難時，吾人亦能利用山野河流，使確保增援補給之優勢，以迎擊敵人。同時，吾人又能因氣候風土不同之影響，將士之體力精神力，必可極度昂揚，故其影響於持久戰力者，當屬極大，（持久戰）為敵人所畏忌不安者，反之，則為吾人之最大期待也。</p>
<p>以新後患進行決戰</p>
<p>當將傾注科學日本之總力，發揮空中，海上，陸上各新兵器，以及將日本独有堅强精神力，科學力，特攻兵器等總力，完全施於此決戰中，以期獲得絕對有利地位。４．就兵力裝備而言，過去敵於加達卡納爾開始太平洋反攻作戰以來，日軍雖然因是不是數之優劣，而　受挫折，然今次本土決戰，則量數之優劣及其地位，恰得相反，今後作戰，吾人必將以優等量數克服敵人。又如本土一旦變為戰場，則上自政府軍官，下迄國民，一億民眾團結一致，由於沖繩所見之（　　死守），（衛護皇土），實屬　國至誠集結之國魂，總之，於本土決戰，系發揮吾人總力最大之機能，以上下一致仇敵愾之心，必使敵人負痛創而敗退也。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>申論和平正義之戰讀穀大使談話書感</h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華穀大使對本市記者團發表談話，關於目前為我國人最開心的幾個大問題，都有坦率而具體的答履。穀大使除了對於聯合國所謂（國際安全機構），加以客觀的批判，和我們一向的持論態度不謀而合之外，對於近來外間所傳和平謠言，中日關系及國府米糧政策，都有值得重視的闡示。我們談後頗有所感，申論如次：</p>
<p>關於和平謠言，穀大使闡明日本對於和平之態度，早在中日同盟條約及大東亞會議共同宣言中有充分表明。並爾最近鈴聲木首相對此亦有明白態度表示。穀大使認為雖有人對日本之態度尚不諒解，但戰爭演變，自將引起彼輩東亞休威相共之自覺。如迎來和平論之繁多，足證有與正　東亞前途者之存在。穀大使更明白表示：（至於日本對於和平之門並未關團，但須觀對方願不願踏進和平之門？此乃為重要之一點）。</p>
<p>日本所未關團的和平之門，是非常公開的，有如日本當局關於大東亞戰爭目的所　次宜示的，是在求東亞各國政治上平等，經濟上與惠，文化上互相尊重固有精神，並保全各國之主權。我們必須認清，這種條件如果實現了，就是和平的完全實現，也就是大東亞戰爭目的的完全實現。因此，在列强特别是英美帝國主義作戰，戰爭與和平是截然不同的兩件事，但大東亞戰爭是為和平及正義的戰爭，是民族解放的戰爭，所以只要正義的目的達到了，就立刻可以踏進和平之門，反之，如果没有正義，没有東亞各國政治上平等，經濟上互惠及文化上互相尊重因有精神，那麼，任何的（和平），都不是我們所願聽的。</p>
<p>我們是愛好和平的國家，國民政府以（和平）與反共建國同列為基本國策，我們參加大東亞戰爭，最終目的在求正義的和平，以實現大東亞人之東亞。今日敵方正在對日本本土及中國大陸准備最大的攻勢，雖然，英美没有踏進正義和平之門的誠意，我們也惟有更加堅決的與日本協力，用自己的血肉力量來爭取正義的和平。</p>
<p>在這最重戰局下，中日兩國的合作關系，是完達東亞戰爭爭取正義和平的主要問題。穀大使在這次談話中說：（凡事欲謀合作，不論其合作之性質如何，只須合作之當事人，真有真實之理念，則其合作性念有意義）。今日雙方的（真實之理念），已毫無疑問的餘地。這種（真實之理念），決不是空言的理論，而必須表現在事實方面，必須表現解決雙方實際及急迫問題上面。我們屢次指出，今日中國急迫的問題是改善民生問題，特别是解決民食問題。這次國府米浪緊急措置之實施及盟邦方面的協辦表示，在我們看來，正是穀大使所謂（真實之理念）的具體化。最令人感動的，是穀大使在談本問題時，曾率直表示：（新發登登場，國府當局是否有新統籌方法，尚不得而知，惟信國府定能適應環境，有妥善方案，届時日本當然仍予協力）。這也正是（真實之理念），足以（使合作性益有意義）。</p>
<p>我們一貫主張，中日間一切困難，決没有不能克服和解決的；而解決的先決條件，就是中日當局和中國民間三方面的深刻了解和密切合作。對於今後中國民食問題民生問題解決是如此，對於中日協辦決戰以求正義和平之實現也如此。</p>

<h3>財政金融最高當局談　取締現鈔貼現　查禁行莊中飽現鈔濫發撥單</h3>
<p>關於現鈔問題，財政金融最高當局發表談話如左：</p>
<p>查近日現鈔發生貼水問題，日趨嚴重，一般社會不明眞相，均歸咎於中儲現鈔之不能充分供給，甚至謂中儲故意造成此種局面，行員乃得從中漁利之無稽之談，本人對於此項問題，決定負起全　，澈底淸源，使之消減。</p>
<p>流通現鈔不足原因</p>
<p>夫現鈔貼水之發生，當然爲市面上流通現鈔不足之故，而流通現鈔不足之原因，有以下數點：　物價繼續高漲，現鈔之需要增加。　在茲農產物收買時期，因向內地匯款有所限制，遂不得不携帶現鈔前往收買，乃促成現鈔之外流。　中儲每日分配各行莊之現鈔數量雖鉅，而一部份行莊，則並不全數支付存戶，惟以中飽漁利是圖。但尚有最重大之原因，爲一般社會所忽略者，厥爲撥款單之泛濫。蓋撥款單爲行莊向中儲行或銀聯會或錢業準備庫支付款項之一種支票，習慣上稱曰撥款單。因撥款單之開發人爲銀行或錢莊，付款人則爲中儲行·銀聯會·錢業準備庫，一般人以爲決無空頭，或退票之情事，故樂於接受，市面上大宗交易，均賴撥款單以爲交割，撥款單之信用過於良好，於是一部份不良行莊，遂得利用撥款單，以製造其需要之資金。本行此次查賬結果，發現行莊之開發撥款單數額超過其所有存款總額四五倍者實繁有徒，而超過銀聯會所有之頭寸，最多有竟達三十倍以上者，每日撥款單之開發，總計銀行錢莊其總數約在一千二百萬元左右，（正式交換銀行不在內）雖非全部空頭，而以各行莊在銀聯會或錢業準備庫之全體頭寸比校，則每日開發空頭資本平均總在其實有頭寸之四五偣以上，信用頭寸之擴大，實覺馭人聽開。此項空頭資金，每日在市面上轉輾流通，設其中有一部份掉換現鈔，則中儲每日付出之現鈔數量，便不足以資應付貼水，焉得而不生此種現象？非特招致現鈔恐悅發生貼水情形，而折來物價狂漲之推動力，實亦在是。我人往往以爲物價之漲，由於通貨膨脹而致，惟通貨旣日膨脹，現鈔當不於感其缺乏，今日之現象，物價則日見增漲，現鈔則日感不足，從可知此種矛盾信用頭寸之過份膨脹，實有以促成之也。行莊開發撥款單，旣無需充分準備頭寸，價值數千百萬元之股票金條或貨物，均可以一紙空頭撥款單，一反掌之間易取到手，物價之漲愈趨愈烈，換言之，即每一銀行或錢莊，均可無限制發行鉅額鈔票，而鈔票兌現之責任，則完全由中儲負擔。長此以往，現鈔無論如何充分供給，貼水決難消減，而物價狂漲，投機充斥，上海金融經濟之危機，勢必日甚一日，陷於不可收拾之地步。</p>
<p>信用頭寸杜絕擴大</p>
<p>乃決定澈底停止撥款單之發行，以杜絕信用頭寸之擴大。茲由銀錢兩業議決於七月三日實行，一律停止使用，將來空頭資金日見收縮，貼水富可漸趨消減，物價亦得臻於穩定，其餘如聯款之緩和，以及禁止現鈔之私運諸問題，亦正在研究改善，而對於一般不良行莊，如已往有中飽現鈔從中漁利，或濫開撥款單本票，超過其實力，以從事於囤積投機行爲者，當從嚴處罰停止其營業。</p>
<p>貼現之風務使根絕</p>
<p>至於每日正當需要之現鈔，當由中儲盡量充分供給，使無缺乏之虞，嗣後貼現之風，務使根絕，人民需用現鈔，各行莊務須儘可能範國與以便利，此層已由中儲行通知各行莊運照辦理，並已飭警察嚴厲取締貼水惡習。凡我民衆務須了解目前情形，體察當局意旨，切勿甘受無謂之損失，輕觸法網，自貽伊戚。至於中儲行員，風聞有收取貼水情形，本人已嚴論制止，倘再有此項情事，准許人民指訴，並經派警密查，一經查實，定行加倍懲辦，決不寬縱。</p>
<h3>上週金融工商　各業市況平穩　當局嚴密取締非法賣買</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商各業市況，最近一週，在國際情勢沉靜聲中，且政府常局嚴密取締非法買賣，是以一般投機市僧無法蠢動，同時當局取締撥款單貼水，定期停止各行莊開發撥款單，及六底行莊辦理半年決算，緊縮抵押放款等種種原因，故市情已趨穩定，烚赤過程平穩，並未突出新高價成交額似較前週減低，紋銀無甚出人。華股週一到週六，始終盤旋低平，美亞已退入八千元關內，永安紗廠與公司亦步隨低落，中小型股，均呈萎疲不振之勢，買戶納胃甚弱，反買爲賣者，實佔多數，人心一時難以振起，大都投資者，目標轉移七月三日之金證券市場新交易。至於工商方面，一週內尚無變化。各業工廠仍受電力限制，生產一時難見起色，各公司商號門市標　售價，少有獎動，米價由政府准許自由採運，來源略見增多，每日每石回跌，約達十萬元左右。小麥新貨已登塲，粉麥會積極進行收買工作，各指定之製粉廠，亦在準備開車製粉，即可補救米糧供應之不足，民食恐慌可逐漸消除，其他雜糧油糖市價漲風止，惟日用品中之肥皂，火柴，燃料等續見上漲。</p>
<h3>征收金特稅委員會成立</h3>
<p>市政府爲管理本市黃金賣買入於正軌起見，前經制定管理烚金買賣數行辦法，呈准行政院公佈施行，並限本市經營烚金業商，自六月十九日起至廿九日止，十天以內，凡已加入公會會員之目營或代客買賣之業商，依法向財政經濟兩局據實呈報。同時爲充裕市庫計，准由財政局於七月一日起，開征黃金特稅。財政局已聘派有關人員組織市征收黃金特稅委員會，以孫　東爲主任委員，已於昨（一）日在市政府三樓二三〇號室成立辦公，開始征稅工作。</p>
<h3>北站警局　代購車票</h3>
<p>當局對米糧統制，自實施緊急措置後，本市北火車站各班客車單帮旅客，突增至三倍以上。因此往來旅客頻繁，列隊購票者，以非常擁擠而發生因難。現市警察局北站分局長爲便利老　婦儒之男女旅客計，乃向北站常局交涉此事，結果甚爲圓滿。據悉其辦法大致爲凡在六十歲以上年老者或爲幼稚，孩童及孕婦等，對於購買火車票可逕向北火車站問詢處，要求代爲購買或逕要求北站警察分局，予以代購亦可，此外如有婚喪急事急需購票乘車者，如經各自住在地區之聯保長，出具證明後，亦可援照前列方法，請求代爲購票。另悉該局對於在北站藉口檢查而向旅客敲詐之不良份子，決心根本絕滅，倘旅客如有發現者，可隨時向該局具實報告。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>讀財政金融當局談話後</h3>
<p>財政金融最高當局，頃就現鈔貼水及一般金融畸形問題，發表談話，我們可以歸納意見數點如次：</p>
<p>常局對於外間以現鈔護生貼水問題，歸咎於中儲，對於行員從中漁利等等，決定負責澈底淸源，這在我們市民是値得欣幸的。</p>
<p>中儲分配行莊現鈔，雖有一部分不肖行莊，並不全數支付存戶，但據錢業方面表示，正式會員錢莊每日僅得極少數現鈔，事實上萬難應付，而少數非正式的小錢莊却神通廣大可有大量貼出。我們認爲今後中儲分配行莊現鈔，首應公開與合理均勻，使不肖行莊無法偸換漁利。</p>
<p>撥款單濫發，更是助長現鈔貼水之重大原因，而撥款單之濫發，平均開發空頭資本在實有頭寸四五倍之上。因此，不肖行莊可以一紙空頭撥款單，換得鉅值之股票金條或其他貨物，達其投機牟利目的。這毬畸形現象，實爲走向余融崩潰的極危險途徑。現在當局雖加阻止，可是，自有撥款單濫發以來，繼之以物價高漲，尤其是糧食飛漲，更繼之以現鈔貼水的猖獗，市民所受痛苦，已經不淺。我們痛定思痛，認爲一切經濟病態，在其發生之起，在學理及經騐的推斷上，可能估計到結朵的。當撥款單濫發之初，米始無人指出危機，而少數金融界實際負責者竟朦蔽當局未能及早防止，以致演變惡化。今後應加强檢查監督職能，並充實調查研究工作，接受專家意見，對於可能發生惡果的金融現象，及早準備防止。</p>
<p>當局旣經查出若干行莊有不法行爲，予以嚴懲，但是，我們更希將不法行莊公開宣佈，否則，不足以　　來者，　儆將來。</p>

<h3>嚴禁剝樹皮者</h3>
<p>— 威冷</p>
<p>本市區八區街道兩旁，多種有法國梧桐，際此炎夏，綠陰濃密，行路者得此蔭蔽，可免驕陽　爍。且此類闊葉植物，體內氣體與外界交換頻繁，有調節大氣中水份與氧氣之含量，於人類健康極有裨益。至於使都市美化，猶其餘事。沿泰山路大興路長興路及與該路交叉之各橫路，皆有茂密之行道樹，排立其旁，小者十許歲，大者已歷數十寒暑，幹材合抱，枝柯交於路之上空，行路者過之路入深林。從前法人曾　珍惜保護之能事，每當冬令將其孱弱者之枝幹，以稻草包裹，至翌年夏初始與解除，蓋恐其形成層受寒威所侵，而致死亡也。今租界已收回，吾人當如何廣種行道樹木，及愛護已成林者，使在吾人手中更加美化，以塞彼西人輕視國人者之口。不料今日任貧苦婦孺剝去行道樹之皮。夫樹之有皮，猶人之有衣也，今盡剝其皮，如果冬令一屆，此失去衣被保障之樹不，將何以自全。抑尤有進者，樹木枝幹之生長，全賴形成層，此層之厚不及一分位於外皮之下層，外皮一去，篩管組織其薄，不能保護形成層，形成層死則全樹死矣。倘吾人將樹幹內外兩皮層（外皮爲木栓層，內皮即篩管層及形成會所合組而成。形成層只有二細胞之厚，內細胞裂殖形成水管，外細胞裂殖則形成篩管，水管專供運輸水份無　原質，由根至葉，篩管則專供運輸葉部製成之有機物，如糖，澱粉，脂肪，蛋白質之類，由葉至恨，）削去一圈約半寸長，則無論若何偉大之樹木，圈以上之部分常年必特別繁榮，至次年即完全枝死，絕無能幸免者。蓋囚根部無有機營養之貯藏，遂飢餓而死也。今無知婦孺剝皮工作，市人視之若無覩者，藎不知植物生長之原理，以爲龐大樹幹去一層薄皮，宜若無損，不知此層外皮一去，則植物所恃以生以長之部份，即失去抵禦嚴寒之能力，大部分必將死亡。且剝皮之風一長，外皮可剝，內皮亦可剝，警察及行人皆司空見慣，不以爲怪矣，數十年長成之樹木，毀於一旦，我政府當局能不引以爲憾。筆者日來經過八區各路，見有剝樹之婦孺　加勸阻，而無法戢此惡風，現市政府已明令嚴禁，然警力容有未逮，則責成自警團員相助辦理。至於家居路旁及行路之人，皆當人人負責，阻遏剝皮行動，俾未剝皮之樹得保健康，其已剝皮者應責成路旁居民，於今冬購買稻草包裹，樹幹庶不至全部死亡，彼等眼看樹皮被剝，熟視無覩，公德心太差，罰之負包裹之責，正所以刺激使之以後不收抱放任熊度也。</p>
<h3>你是「幸運者」麼？</h3>
<p>— 羔鷹</p>
<p>—市校聯合畢業典禮印象—</p>
<p>戴教育局長在羅秘書長致訓前約略報告了參加這次畢榮典禮的學校和人數。計中學校九，師範二，小學三十二。畢榮人數小學一，三七二人（五〇九，女二〇八）中學六六八人，（男四六〇，女二〇八，）師範八一人。總共參加者爲二〇四〇人，除了中國學生外尚有西僑學生參加，國籍不一。</p>
<p>羅秘書長給證時，由四個學校的代表登臺接受，第一個是小學生穿着短褲運動衫，很活潑地表現出小學生的精神。第二個代表中學生，穿陰丹士林長衫，倒也十足表現了中學生的氣派，此外一個代表女生，一個代表西僑，也是女生。可是前者的身體似乎遠不及後者的健碩。</p>
<p>典禮將告完畢時，全體學生起立唱畢業歌，「浦江東繞，淞水流長，彙爲文化邦……莘莘學子，芟然成章，負笈來四方……解放，解放，高舉还颺，天宇任翱翔。」音調抑揚，殊爲動聽。</p>
<p>不多一刻，這個盛大的畢業典禮告畢，羅秘書長，貴賓，長官等依次步出會場，接着兩千多個學生也列隊魚貫而出。他們是否得以繼續升學，或者因爲家庭的經濟關係而被迫輟學，這個謎一時也無從代爲解答。不是這裏可以肯定的，本年下半學期的家長負擔，一定較上學期爲更重；而得以升學的男女學生們等，他們又將成爲幸運者中間的更幸遝者了。</p>
<p>將近走出大光明的大門，看見擁在預購戲票櫃前的男女靑年們，已很自然的被編成一條「辮子」，伸着膀子向玻璃窗孔裏預購戲票，售票員很專心很迅速地在一木本厚厚的戲票上蓋日則截子，無疑，生意是「好」得很。影戲的票價　花樓三千元　櫻聽二千五百元　正聽二千元下學期小學學費約計　五六級一萬二千元　三四級一萬元　一二級八千元</p>
<p>無意中得到了上而兩抓數目字，誠如羅秘書長所說的，昨天在大光明的二千個中小學生爲時代的幸運者，因爲他們還有能力讀書，有福氣可以讀到畢業。那末摘在售票洞窗口的這明靑年男女一定是幸運中之尤幸運者了。理由似乎不必多　囌罷。</p>
<p>許多有志氣的靑年男女，希望下期可以升學，可是他們家庭的環境允許麼？</p>
<p>有能力看電影的男女靑年們，你們能自己抑制一些，帮助具有同樣熟情，同樣上進心，而細於經濟的同時代的靑年麼？</p>
<p>走出大光明，一個孩子向我兜售小型報，我說，好，我就買一張。下面的對話，作爲本文的結束。</p>
<p>「你幾歲了？」</p>
<p>「十三歲。」</p>
<p>「讀過書麼？」</p>
<p>「讀過兩年。」</p>
<p>「資報的生意還好麼？」</p>
<p>小孩子朝着他的主顧看着，嘴裏吞吞吐吐地說道：</p>
<p>「我今天還是第一天實報哩。」</p>
<p>「那末如何要出來賣報呢？」</p>
<p>「爸爸已去世，家裏只有媽媽，在人家帮傭。」</p>
<p>「一共賣去幾張了？」</p>
<p>「到現在爲止買去了八張。」</p>
<p>其他可以不必再問下去了。這孩子叫范仁源，浦東人。</p>
<p>十三歲－舞勺之年，不是道地標準的學齡兒童麼？當同年齡的這一千幾白個學童在大光明裏面參加畢業典禮時，他在大光明門口出賣小報，維　着他的小生命。</p>
<p>幸運者，更幸運者，帮助別人求學是件義俠的舉動，請問你是不是上述二者間之一？（完）</p>

<h3>Declaration on Visiting Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Upon his arrival in Japan, Philippine President Laurel issued the following statement: About a year ago, the Japanese government provided tremendous support for the independence of the Philippine Republic and its recognition by various countries. In order to convey the deep gratitude of the Philippine government and people to His Majesty the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government, a delegation was dispatched to Japan. Now, in light of the current war situation and various issues arising, we have come to Japan for consultations with the Japanese government. I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity to personally express my gratitude in my capacity as President of the Philippine Republic for the tolerance, inclusiveness, and profound kindness of the Japanese government. I and my delegation are deeply moved and grateful to have been granted an audience by His Majesty the Emperor. I will never forget the inspiring words His Majesty bestowed upon us. I also express my sincere gratitude for the heartfelt welcome and understanding of the Prime Minister and other ministers, as well as all the Japanese leaders. Under the current military situation, I firmly believe that not only the Philippine Republic, but also the nations that make up Greater East Asia and the oppressed peoples of the world, will eventually achieve freedom and independence.</p>
<h3>Japan Will Exhibit Total Strength in the Absolute Superiority of Decisive Battle on Home Soil</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – If we review the past operations of the enemy forces, we can see that they believe that once the objective of advancing their bases has been achieved, they will shift to new targets without waiting for the end of the land war. This is an unchangeable strategy of the American military. Therefore, what strategy will the enemy adopt after the Battle of Okinawa? It is likely to be one of three options: advancing bases, launching a landing operation on the Chinese mainland, or directly attacking the Japanese mainland. In any case, the enemy will undoubtedly intensify air raids and bombings, and forcibly blockade the coast. It cannot be denied that the end of the land war in Okinawa has marked the beginning of a new phase.</p>
<p>National War for Final Victory</p>
<p>The decisive battle on Japanese soil is the final battle. In other words, it is a battle that will determine the survival of the Japanese nation, a battle for Japan's self-preservation. Therefore, we must resolutely rise up to overcome all obstacles in our path. The wars in various parts of Greater East Asia are closely related to the defense of the Japanese homeland, which cannot be denied. The war on Japanese soil is not just a war fought by the military, but a national war in which 100 million citizens unite to defend the nation and its territory, and to strive for final victory. This is its greatest feature. In the decisive battle on home soil, there is no distinction between the front lines and the rear. All 100 million citizens will follow the brave and unparalleled Imperial Army, serving as production soldiers, transportation soldiers, and communications soldiers, and engage in the war effort. Therefore, the National Volunteer Corps and the National War Corps are of great significance. The recent frequent enemy air raids and indiscriminate bombings across various regions are merely attempts to cut off Japan's connection with the South and the Chinese mainland, isolate the Japanese economy, or conduct ideological warfare.</p>
<p>Fully Utilize Lessons from Okinawa</p>
<p>The war leaders of the enemy Americans also deeply understand that the Japanese are not a people who can be easily subdued. In order to achieve their great goal of destroying Japan, they will ultimately land on Japanese soil and engage in a desperate battle with the Japanese army. This is very clear. This ambition of the enemy Americans has not only been stated by Truman, but it is also the inevitable outcome given the nature of this war. However, we have long been fully aware of the enemy's intentions, and we deeply understand that the decisive battle on home soil will determine our fate. All 100 million citizens have the ambition to fight the enemy with the same hatred and resentment, to defeat the enemy that dares to land, and to achieve final victory. If so, how should we destroy the enemy's forces when we launch the decisive battle on home soil? In short, the decisive battle on home soil is completely different from the previous island-hopping operations. In the latter, the enemy took the offensive, while we only adopted a defensive posture. This time, however, we will launch an offensive against the enemy and seize the initiative. In other words, we must understand that the decisive battle on home soil is the final battle, and that all the lessons and hints learned from the Battle of Okinawa should be fully utilized in the future. If the enemy attempts to attack, our army and navy will not wait for the enemy to act first. Army Minister Anami stated this at a recent session of the extraordinary Diet. If the enemy invades our homeland, we will first use our air force and naval vessels, especially special attack units, to launch a fierce attack at sea and destroy them. Furthermore, we will attack the coastline with air force, special naval attack units, and coastal artillery. Even if the enemy manages to land, Japan will use its elite field army to destroy their entire force. Regarding the absolute superiority and inevitable victory in the tactics of the decisive battle on home soil, the following points can be summarized:</p>
<p>Fully Utilize Elite Forces</p>
<p>Japanese military strength enjoys absolute superiority. Since the Battle of Guadalcanal, in island warfare, Japanese forces have been isolated and unable to do anything but use their available combat power to resist the concentrated attacks of the overwhelmingly superior enemy. However, in the decisive battle on home soil, the situation is completely reversed. Against the enemy forces that cross the Pacific to invade the Japanese mainland, the Japanese side is fully prepared to continuously attack with its elite forces. US President Truman has stated that 7 million soldiers will be mobilized for the war against Japan. This is nothing more than a deceitful propaganda tactic by the enemy, intending to use the pressure of this number to confuse the Japanese people. From this, we can further discern that the enemy is currently anxious about the lengthening of their supply lines and the shortage of transport ships. Conversely, Japan has no such worries. This can be seen from what Army Minister Anami pointed out, (we currently possess elite land forces numbering several million). Furthermore, the National Volunteer Combat Teams formed under the recently enacted (Volunteer Military Service Law) are specifically tasked with rear support duties. This is an advantage in the decisive battle on home soil. In battles fought outside of the homeland, rear support duties are mostly borne by the military. However, in the decisive battle on home soil, these important rear support duties will be borne by the combat teams, so all military forces can be deployed to the front lines. The ability to utilize all forces is an absolute advantage in the battle on home soil.</p>
<p>Secure Terrain and Reinforcements</p>
<p>The terrain of the homeland favors our side. In wartime, one must be familiar with the terrain and features of the battlefield. In the decisive battle on home soil, not only mountains, rivers, forests, and roads, but even every blade of grass and tree can be turned into combat power. Utilizing the terrain and features provides essential maneuverability on the inside lines. If this can be maximized, it can be used to launch concentrated attacks against the enemy's superior forces, allowing the traditional maneuverability of the Japanese army to be fully utilized. An unprecedented field battle, unseen since the Japanese-American war, will encircle and annihilate the enemy. Furthermore, looking back at the previous island-hopping operations, the most difficult aspect for Japan was its supply capacity. This situation will inevitably shift to the enemy. From our extremely advantageous position of having the battlefield as our supply base, we will be able to fully supply the front lines in a timely manner with weapons, ammunition, food, and other supplies. Although it is expected that the enemy will attempt to thoroughly bomb railways, communications lines, and destroy bridges, materials for repairing damaged critical transportation lines have already been prepared. In the unlikely event that repairs are difficult, we will be able to utilize mountains, fields, and rivers to secure the advantage of reinforcements and supplies to counter the enemy. At the same time, due to the influence of different climates and environments, the physical and mental strength of our soldiers will be greatly enhanced, which will have a significant impact on our ability to sustain the war. (Prolonged war) is something that the enemy fears and worries about, but it is our greatest expectation.</p>
<p>Conduct the Decisive Battle with New Weaponry</p>
<p>We will devote the total scientific power of Japan and deploy aerial, naval, and land-based new weaponry, as well as Japan's unique strong spirit, scientific power, special attack weapons, and other total forces in this decisive battle, in order to gain an absolutely advantageous position. 4. In terms of troop strength and equipment, although the Japanese army has suffered setbacks in the Pacific counteroffensive operations since Guadalcanal due to the inferiority of numbers, in this decisive battle on home soil, the superiority of quantity and its position are exactly the opposite. In future operations, we will definitely overcome the enemy with superior numbers. Furthermore, once the homeland becomes a battlefield, the entire population of 100 million, from government officials to ordinary citizens, will unite as one. What we saw in Okinawa (to defend to the death), (to protect our homeland), is truly the concentration of the national spirit of loyalty and sincerity. In short, in the decisive battle on home soil, we will exert the greatest function of our total strength, and with the united hatred of the enemy from top to bottom, we will inflict painful damage on the enemy and force them to retreat in defeat.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the War for Peace and Justice: Reflections on Ambassador Tani's Speech</h3>
<p>Ambassador Tani, the Japanese envoy to China, gave a speech to the press corps of this city, providing candid and concrete answers to several major issues of utmost concern to our people. Aside from objectively criticizing the United Nations' so-called (International Security Organization), aligning with our consistent stance, Ambassador Tani also offered noteworthy clarifications on recent peace rumors, Sino-Japanese relations, and the National Government's rice policy. After discussing this, we had some thoughts to share:</p>
<p>Regarding peace rumors, Ambassador Tani clarified that Japan's attitude toward peace was fully expressed in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Conference's Joint Declaration. Furthermore, Prime Minister Suzuki also recently expressed a clear attitude on this matter. Ambassador Tani believes that while some may not yet understand Japan's attitude, the evolution of the war will awaken them to the shared interests of East Asia. The proliferation of discussions on peace proves the existence of those who care about the future of East Asia. Ambassador Tani further stated clearly: (As for Japan, the door to peace has not been closed, but it depends on whether the other party is willing to step through the door. This is a crucial point).</p>
<p>The door to peace that Japan has not closed is very open, as repeatedly demonstrated by Japanese authorities regarding the objectives of the Greater East Asia War: to seek political equality for all East Asian nations, economic reciprocity, cultural respect for inherent values, and the preservation of each nation's sovereignty. We must recognize that if these conditions are met, peace will be fully realized, and the objectives of the Greater East Asia War will be fully achieved. Therefore, in the war against the great powers, especially British and American imperialism, war and peace are two completely different things. However, the Greater East Asia War is a war for peace and justice, a war for national liberation. As long as the just objectives are achieved, we can immediately step through the door to peace. Conversely, without justice, without political equality, economic reciprocity, and cultural respect for the inherent values of East Asian nations, any (peace) is not what we want to hear.</p>
<p>We are a peace-loving nation. The National Government has established (peace) and anti-communism as fundamental national policies. Our ultimate goal in participating in the Greater East Asia War is to seek a just peace to realize an East Asia for East Asians. Today, the enemy is preparing its largest offensive against the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland. Although Britain and America lack the sincerity to step through the door to just peace, we can only more firmly cooperate with Japan and use our own flesh and blood to fight for a just peace.</p>
<p>In this most critical phase of the war, the cooperative relationship between China and Japan is the main issue in achieving the objectives of the East Asia War and fighting for a just peace. In this speech, Ambassador Tani said: (If cooperation is desired in anything, regardless of the nature of the cooperation, as long as the parties involved truly have a genuine understanding, the cooperation will be meaningful). Today, there is no doubt about the (genuine understanding) between the two sides. This (genuine understanding) is not just empty theory, but must be expressed in facts, must be expressed in solving the practical and urgent problems of both sides. We have repeatedly pointed out that China's most pressing problem today is improving the people's livelihood, especially solving the food problem. The implementation of the National Government's emergency measures regarding rice and the assistance provided by the allies, in our view, are a concrete manifestation of what Ambassador Tani calls (genuine understanding). Most touching is that Ambassador Tani frankly stated when discussing this issue: (It is not yet known whether the National Government authorities have new planning methods regarding the newly discovered rice production, but it is believed that the National Government will be able to adapt to the environment and have a proper plan, and Japan will, of course, continue to cooperate at that time). This is also (genuine understanding), which will (make cooperation more meaningful).</p>
<p>We have consistently maintained that there is no difficulty between China and Japan that cannot be overcome and resolved. The prerequisite for resolution is a deep understanding and close cooperation among the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the Chinese people. This is true for resolving the problems of the Chinese people's food and livelihood in the future, and it is also true for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the decisive battle to achieve a just peace.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Shanghai Special Municipality: Outline of Business for Financial Institutions; Revised and Promulgated by the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch) To strengthen the operations of financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance previously formulated fifteen articles of the "Outline for Strengthening the Operations of Financial Institutions in the Shanghai Special Municipality" on October 31st of the previous year, and promulgated them for implementation. Subsequently, on November 21st of the same year and January 21st of this year, the outline was extended to Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Bengbu, Wuxi, Changzhou, Wuhu, and other locations respectively. After the implementation of this strengthened outline, the business of financial institutions in those locations gradually entered the right track. However, the outline did not explicitly regulate interbank lending, borrowing, and bill handling. The Ministry of Finance has specially added four articles to improve it. The full text of the revised outline is recorded below: (Articles 8 to 11 are the newly added ones)</p>
<p>Article 1: This outline is formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the "Regulations for the Management of Financial Institutions by the Ministry of Finance."</p>

<p>*   Trust companies: Paid-up capital of 10 million yuan</p>
<p>If a bank or native bank also engages in savings or trust business, or a trust company also engages in banking business, the amount of capital of the concurrently operated part shall be increased by 5 million yuan. For branches, sub-banks, or sub-companies of financial institutions with headquarters outside the municipality, the amount of capital shall be calculated at half of the amounts stipulated in the preceding two paragraphs. The minimum amount of capital after a merger of financial institutions that should be merged under the provisions of the preceding article is the same as in the first and second paragraphs of this article.</p>
<p>Article 5: Financial institutions shall maintain a payment reserve of at least 30% of the total amount of deposits other than time deposits. The payment reserve mentioned in the preceding paragraph includes the following:</p>

<p>The payment reserve in the preceding paragraph shall be reported daily to the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank for verification.</p>
<p>Article 6: If the payment reserve of a financial institution is reduced to less than 30%, it shall be replenished within five days. If it is not replenished within the time limit, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank shall promptly report to the Ministry of Finance to punish its responsible person or order it to close.</p>
<p>Article 7: In addition to complying with the "Regulations on Loan Restrictions," financial institutions shall first submit the amount, purpose, repayment method, collateral, etc., of loans exceeding the following amounts to the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank for approval, which is also the case when establishing overdraft limits:</p>

<p>Article 11: When a financial institution receives interbank bills as deposits, payment shall only be made after the bills have been actually received.</p>
<p>Article 12: The purchase and sale of securities by financial institutions shall be limited to government-issued bonds and treasury bills, and company stocks shall be limited to various stocks that have been approved for trading on the exchange.

<h3>War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: In the Okinawa area, the battle in the southern island area of Okinawa Island has inflicted great damage on the enemy and is now in its final stages. In the mountainous area of the northern part of the island, a part of the Japanese army continues to fight back. The enemy is now focusing all its efforts on expanding and preparing the Okinawa land base, continuously opening up convoy groups and replenishing resources. On the 25th, there was a fleet of about 200 ships near Ryukyu. The Japanese air force attacked them for several days, achieving considerable results, greatly undermining the enemy's attempts. This week, the enemy landed on Kume Island to strengthen the outer airport. In the Mariana and Ogasawara areas, the enemy air force in Mariana, as in the past week, attacked industrial facilities near small and medium-sized cities in the Japanese mainland, and dropped torpedoes and incendiary bombs in various directions, frequently conducting reconnaissance in various places. This phenomenon is quite noteworthy. The U.S. Air Force has used Iwo Jima as a temporary landing site, which has been quite effective. The Japanese Air Force attacked the airport on the 23rd, causing fires in four places. In the Southwest Pacific, the war in Borneo and Halmahera is quite active. Enemy ships are still carrying out mine sweeping operations against Balikpapan. The Japanese air force squadron is fighting them. The Ternate Island front in the Halmahera region is in a stalemate. In Luzon, around June 21, the enemy's 11th Airborne Division landed near Aparri at the northern end of the island, and then gradually moved south. In response, the 32nd and 25th Divisions suffered heavy casualties from the Japanese army's fierce attacks. The 37th Division is retreating steadily and is currently engaged in fierce battles. Around June 23, the enemy invaded to about 20 kilometers south of San Pablo. Japanese troops launched fierce battles against the enemy forces attacking from the north and south. The Japanese troops in the mountainous area east of Manila are still fighting bravely. In Burma, due to the rainy season, the roads are muddy, and the fighting between the two sides has stalled. The Japanese army, taking advantage of the mountain dangers to resist the enemy, launched fierce battles on the highlands and is currently preventing the enemy from advancing south.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Admits Heavy Damage in Okinawa Operations</h3>
<p>Zurich, 1st - Central News Agency dispatch: NATO reports and the press recently sent personnel from Guam to describe the situation in Okinawa as follows: Since the Pearl Harbor operation, the U.S. military has never suffered such heavy damage. The U.S. military did not pay attention to the Japanese army absorbing Okinawan people to serve as reservists, which increased the military strength. Their bravery and combat skills are no less than those of soldiers. Buckner admitted that he had underestimated the Japanese military strength, saying that the defensive positions were too stubborn, which delayed the Okinawa operation. In the future, Buckner will continue to supplement the U.S. military, so that the divisions can continue to fight. The U.S. military is standing in front of the Baling of the city of Shuri, and the remaining remnants are numerous.

<h3>Top Financial Authorities Talk About Cracking Down on Cash Discounting and Investigating and Prohibiting Banks from Profiteering from Cash and Issuing Allocation Orders</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of cash, the top financial authorities issued a statement as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, the issue of cash discounts has become increasingly serious. The general public does not understand the truth and attributes it to the insufficient supply of Central Reserve Bank cash, and even claims that the Central Reserve Bank deliberately created this situation so that employees can profit from it. I have decided to take full responsibility for this issue and thoroughly eliminate the source to reduce it.</p>
<p>Reasons for Insufficient Cash in Circulation</p>
<p>The occurrence of cash discounts is of course due to the insufficient cash in circulation on the market. The reasons for insufficient cash in circulation are as follows: 1. Prices continue to rise, and the demand for cash increases. 2. During the current period of purchasing agricultural products, due to restrictions on remittances to the interior, it is necessary to carry cash to purchase, which promotes the outflow of cash. 3. Although the Central Reserve Bank distributes a large amount of cash to various banks daily, some banks do not fully pay it to depositors, but only seek to profit from it. But there is a most important reason that is overlooked by the general public, namely, the abuse of allocation orders. An allocation order is a type of check issued by a bank to the Central Reserve Bank, the Bankers' Association, or the Native Bankers' Association to pay funds. It is conventionally called an allocation order. Because the issuer of the allocation order is a bank and the payer is the Central Reserve Bank, the Bankers' Association, or the Native Bankers' Association, the general public believes that there is no bounced check, so they are happy to accept it. Most of the large transactions on the market rely on allocation orders for settlement. The credit of allocation orders is too good, so some bad banks can use allocation orders to create the funds they need. The results of this audit found that the amount of allocation orders issued by the bank exceeded its total deposits by four or five times, and the amount exceeding the total positions of the Bankers' Association reached more than thirty times. The daily development of allocation orders, totaling about 12 million yuan for banks and native banks (excluding formal exchange banks), although not all are bad checks, compared with the overall positions of each bank in the Bankers' Association or the Native Bankers' Association, the daily development of empty capital averages more than four or five times its actual positions. The expansion of credit positions is really frightening. These empty funds circulate on the market every day. If a part of them is exchanged for cash, the amount of cash paid by the Central Reserve Bank daily will not be enough to cope with the discount, how can this phenomenon not occur? Not only does it cause cash to be scarce and discounts to occur, but it also drives up prices. We often think that the rise in prices is due to inflation, but since inflation is increasing day by day, cash should not feel its lack. Today's phenomenon is that prices are rising day by day, and cash is becoming increasingly insufficient. From this, it can be known that the excessive expansion of this contradictory credit position is the reason for it. Banks issue allocation orders without needing to fully prepare positions. Stocks, gold bars, or goods worth several millions of yuan can be easily obtained with a piece of empty allocation order. The rise in prices is becoming more and more intense. In other words, each bank can issue huge amounts of banknotes without limit, and the responsibility for cashing the banknotes is entirely borne by the Central Reserve Bank. If this continues, no matter how much cash is supplied, the discount will be difficult to reduce, and price increases will be rampant. The crisis of Shanghai's financial economy will inevitably become more and more serious, and it will be irretrievable.</p>
<p>Resolutely Prevent the Expansion of Credit Positions</p>
<p>Therefore, it has been decided to completely stop the issuance of allocation orders to prevent the expansion of credit positions. The banking industry decided to implement it on July 3 and stop using it altogether. In the future, empty funds will gradually shrink, the discount will gradually decrease, and prices will become stable. Other issues such as the easing of remittance restrictions and the prohibition of private transportation of cash are also being studied and improved. As for the general bad banks, such as those who have profited from cash in the past or abused the issuance of allocation orders and promissory notes, exceeding their strength to engage in hoarding and speculation, they will be severely punished and their business will be suspended.</p>
<p>The Practice of Discounting Must be Eradicated</p>
<p>As for the cash that is needed daily, the Central Reserve Bank will supply it as much as possible to ensure that there is no shortage. In the future, the practice of discounting must be eradicated. Banks must provide convenience to the people who need cash as much as possible. This has been notified by the Central Reserve Bank to various banks to follow. The police have been ordered to strictly crack down on the evil practice of discounting. All of our people must understand the current situation, understand the intentions of the authorities, and never suffer unnecessary losses or touch the law. As for the employees of the Central Reserve Bank, it is rumored that they are charging discounts. I have strictly prohibited it. If this happens again, the people are allowed to complain. The police have been dispatched to secretly investigate. Once verified, they will be punished twice as severely and will never be tolerated.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Financial and Industrial Market Conditions Were Stable; Authorities Strictly Cracked Down on Illegal Transactions</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai last week were calm amidst the international situation, and the government strictly cracked down on illegal transactions, so the general speculative market could not stir up trouble. At the same time, the authorities cracked down on allocation order discounts, scheduled to stop the issuance of allocation orders by various banks, and the banks handled semi-annual settlements at the end of June, tightening mortgage lending and other reasons, so the market situation has stabilized, the process is stable, and new highs have not been achieved. The transaction volume seems to be lower than the previous week, and silver has not changed much. From Monday to Saturday, the Chinese stock market hovered low and flat. Mei Ya retreated into the 8,000 yuan level, and Yong'an Spinning Mill and Company also fell in step. Small and medium-sized stocks were all weak and sluggish. Buyers were very weak, and sellers were actually the majority. It was difficult to revive people's hearts for a while. Most investors shifted their targets to the new trading of the gold securities market on July 3. As for industry and commerce, there were no changes in a week. Factories in various industries are still subject to power restrictions, and production is difficult to improve for a while. The prices of goods sold in various companies and shops are rarely awarded, and the price of rice is allowed to be freely transported by the government, and the source has slightly increased. The price of each stone fell back to about 100,000 yuan per day. New wheat has been launched, and the flour association is actively carrying out purchasing work. The designated flour mills are also preparing to start producing flour, which can remedy the shortage of rice supply, and the panic of people's food can be gradually eliminated. The rising prices of other grains, oil, and sugar have stopped, but daily necessities such as soap, matches, and fuel continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Special Gold Tax Collection Committee</h3>
<p>To manage the gold trade in this city in a proper manner, the Municipal Government previously formulated measures for managing gold trading firms. These measures were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. All gold trading businesses in the city, whether operating independently or acting as agents, were required to truthfully report to the Finance and Economic Bureaus from June 19th to June 29th, a period of ten days, in accordance with the law, if they were already members of the guild. At the same time, to augment the municipal treasury, the Finance Bureau was authorized to levy a special tax on gold starting July 1st. The Finance Bureau has appointed relevant personnel to form the Municipal Special Gold Tax Collection Committee, with Sun Dong as the chairman. The committee was established yesterday (the 1st) in Room 230 on the third floor of the Municipal Government Building to begin tax collection work.</p>
<h3>North Railway Station Police Bureau: Purchasing Train Tickets on Behalf</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of emergency measures for the control of rice and grain, the number of passengers traveling alone on various passenger trains at the North Railway Station has suddenly increased more than threefold. As a result, the flow of passengers is frequent, and those queuing to purchase tickets face extreme congestion and difficulty. Now, the chief of the North Railway Station Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to facilitate elderly, female, and child passengers, has negotiated this matter with the North Railway Station authorities, and the outcome has been very satisfactory. It is understood that the general approach is that elderly individuals over the age of sixty, young children, and pregnant women can directly inquire at the North Railway Station information desk to request assistance with purchasing train tickets, or they can directly request the North Railway Station Police Branch to purchase tickets on their behalf. In addition, in cases of urgent matters such as weddings or funerals that require immediate ticket purchases, a certificate can be obtained from the Lianbao chief in their respective residential areas, and the same method can be used to request assistance with purchasing tickets. It is also understood that the bureau is determined to eradicate unscrupulous individuals who extort passengers under the pretext of inspection at the North Railway Station. Passengers who discover such behavior can report it to the bureau at any time with accurate details.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>After Reading Remarks by Financial Authorities</h3>
<p>The highest financial authorities recently issued statements addressing the current discount on cash and general financial abnormalities. We can summarize the following points:</p>
<p>The authorities attribute the problem of cash discounts to the Central Bank, as well as to employees profiting from it, and have decided to take responsibility for thoroughly eliminating the source. This is welcome news to our citizens.</p>
<p>Although some unscrupulous banks and financial institutions do not fully pay depositors when distributing cash from the Central Bank, according to financial circles, formal member money shops receive only a very small amount of cash daily, making it practically impossible to cope. However, a few informal small money shops have great connections and can issue large amounts of cash. We believe that in the future, the Central Bank's distribution of cash to banks and financial institutions should be public, reasonable, and even, so that unscrupulous banks and financial institutions cannot secretly profit.</p>
<p>The excessive issuance of appropriation orders is a major cause of the cash discount, with the average amount of overdraft capital being four to five times the actual available funds. As a result, unscrupulous banks and financial institutions can use a single worthless appropriation order to exchange for a large value of stocks, gold bars, or other goods, achieving their speculative profit-making goals. This abnormal phenomenon is a very dangerous path leading to financial collapse. Although the authorities are now trying to stop it, the public has already suffered from the rampant issuance of appropriation orders, followed by soaring prices, especially for food, and then by the rampant discount on cash. We have learned a painful lesson and believe that all economic pathologies can be estimated based on theoretical and empirical deductions from their inception. At the beginning of the excessive issuance of appropriation orders, no one pointed out the crisis, and the few financial leaders who were actually responsible concealed the situation from the authorities, failing to prevent it in a timely manner, which led to its worsening. In the future, the functions of inspection and supervision should be strengthened, and research and investigation work should be improved, accepting expert opinions and preparing to prevent financial phenomena that may have adverse consequences as early as possible.</p>
<p>Now that the authorities have found that some banks and financial institutions have engaged in illegal activities, they should be severely punished. However, we hope that the illegal banks and financial institutions will be publicly announced, otherwise, it will not be enough to deter others and warn future offenders.</p>
<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Bark Strippers</h3>
<p>— Wei Leng</p>
<p>Many French parasol trees are planted on both sides of the streets in the eighth district of this city. At this time of the hot summer, the dense green shade provides shelter for pedestrians, saving them from the scorching sun. Moreover, this type of broad-leaved plant exchanges gases with the outside world frequently, which is very beneficial to human health as it regulates the content of water and oxygen in the atmosphere. As for beautifying the city, that is an added benefit. Along Taisan Road, Daxing Road, Changxing Road, and various cross streets intersecting with these roads, there are lush roadside trees standing alongside, the smaller ones being ten or so years old, and the larger ones having weathered dozens of winters and summers. The trunks are several arm spans around, and the branches and leaves intersect above the road, making pedestrians feel as if they are entering a deep forest. In the past, the French were able to cherish and protect them. Every winter, they would wrap the branches of the weaker ones with straw, and only remove it in the following summer, fearing that the cambium layer would be invaded by the cold and die. Now that the concession has been recovered, we should consider how to plant more roadside trees and protect the existing forests to further beautify them in our hands, silencing those Westerners who look down on the Chinese people. Unexpectedly, today, poor women and children are allowed to strip the bark off the roadside trees. The bark is to a tree what clothing is to a person. If all the bark is stripped off, how will these trees, deprived of their protective clothing, survive the winter? Furthermore, the growth of tree branches and trunks depends entirely on the cambium layer. This layer, less than a millimeter thick, is located under the outer bark. Once the outer bark is removed, the phloem tissue, which is thin, cannot protect the cambium layer. If the cambium layer dies, the entire tree dies. If we cut off a ring of both the inner and outer bark layers of a tree trunk (the outer bark is the phellem layer, and the inner bark is composed of the phloem layer and the cambium. The cambium is only two cells thick. The inner cells divide to form xylem, and the outer cells divide to form phloem. Xylem is specifically for transporting water from the roots to the leaves, and phloem is specifically for transporting organic matter, such as sugar, starch, fat, and protein, produced by the leaves, from the leaves to the roots.) about half an inch wide, the part of the tree above the ring will always be particularly prosperous for a year, but will completely die in the following year, without exception. This is because the roots have no storage of organic nutrients and starve to death. Today, ignorant women and children are stripping the bark, and people in the city regard it as if they do not see it. They do not understand the principles of plant growth, thinking that removing a thin layer of bark from a large tree trunk will not cause any damage, not knowing that once this outer bark is removed, the part of the plant that it relies on to live and grow loses its ability to resist the severe cold, and most of it will die. Moreover, if the trend of bark stripping continues, the outer bark can be stripped, and the inner bark can also be stripped. Police and pedestrians will become accustomed to it and will not think it strange. Trees that have grown for decades will be destroyed in a day. How can our government authorities not feel regret? In recent days, the author has passed through various roads in the eighth district and has tried to dissuade women and children from stripping bark, but cannot stop this bad trend. Now, the Municipal Government has issued a clear order strictly prohibiting it, but the police force may not be able to reach everywhere, so the responsibility should be assigned to the self-defense team members to assist in the handling. As for those who live by the roadside and those who travel, everyone should be responsible for stopping the act of bark stripping, so that the trees that have not been stripped can be kept healthy, and those that have already been stripped should be required by the residents by the roadside to buy straw and wrap the tree trunks this winter, so that they do not all die. Those who watch the bark being stripped and do nothing have a very poor sense of public morality, and fining them with the responsibility of wrapping them is precisely to stimulate them so that they do not adopt a laissez-faire attitude in the future.</p>
<h3>Are You a "Lucky One"?</h3>
<p>— Gao Ying</p>
<p>—Impressions of the Joint Graduation Ceremony of Municipal Schools—</p>
<p>Director Dai of the Education Bureau briefly reported the schools and number of students participating in this graduation ceremony before Secretary-General Luo delivered his speech. There were nine middle schools, two normal schools, and thirty-two primary schools. The number of graduates was 1,372 in primary schools (509 boys, 208 girls), 668 in middle schools (460 boys, 208 girls), and 81 in normal schools. The total number of participants was 2,040. In addition to Chinese students, there were also foreign students of various nationalities.</p>
<p>When Secretary-General Luo presented the certificates, representatives from four schools went on stage to receive them. The first was a primary school student wearing shorts and a sports shirt, vividly demonstrating the spirit of primary school students. The second representative was a middle school student wearing a dark blue linen long gown, fully showing the demeanor of a middle school student. In addition, there was a female representative and a foreign representative, also female. However, the former's body seemed far less robust than the latter's.</p>
<p>As the ceremony was about to end, all the students stood up and sang the graduation song, "The Huangpu River winds eastward, the Song River flows long, converging into a land of culture... Diligent students, becoming accomplished, come from all directions... Liberation, liberation, high-held banners, soar in the sky." The melody was uplifting and very moving.</p>
<p>Shortly after, this grand graduation ceremony ended. Secretary-General Luo, distinguished guests, and officials walked out of the venue in order, followed by more than two thousand students in orderly rows. Whether they will be able to continue their studies, or will be forced to drop out due to family economic circumstances, this mystery cannot be answered for the time being. What can be certain is that the financial burden on parents in the second semester of this year will definitely be heavier than in the first semester; and the male and female students who can continue their studies will become the even luckier among the lucky ones.</p>
<p>As I was about to walk out of the gate of the Great World, I saw the young men and women crowded in front of the ticket pre-sale counter, already naturally formed into a "queue," stretching their arms toward the glass window to pre-purchase movie tickets. The ticket seller was very focused and quick at stamping the date on a thick book of movie tickets. Undoubtedly, business was "very good." The price of movie tickets: 3,000 yuan for the grand hall, 2,500 yuan for the second hall, 2,000 yuan for the main hall. Estimated tuition fees for primary school in the second semester: 12,000 yuan for grades 5-6, 10,000 yuan for grades 3-4, 8,000 yuan for grades 1-2.</p>
<p>I inadvertently obtained the above two sets of figures. As Secretary-General Luo said, the two thousand primary and middle school students in the Great World yesterday were the lucky ones of the times, because they still have the ability to study and the blessing to graduate. Then, the young men and women standing at the ticket window must be the luckiest of the lucky ones. The reason seems to need not be stated.</p>
<p>Many ambitious young men and women hope to continue their studies next semester, but will their family circumstances allow it?</p>
<p>Young men and women who can afford to watch movies, can you restrain yourselves a little and help your contemporary young people who have the same passion and the same desire to improve themselves, but are struggling financially?</p>
<p>Walking out of the Great World, a child offered to sell me a small newspaper. I said, "Okay, I'll buy one." The following dialogue serves as the end of this article.</p>
<p>"How old are you?"</p>
<p>"Thirteen years old."</p>
<p>"Have you gone to school?"</p>
<p>"I went for two years."</p>
<p>"Is the newspaper business good?"</p>
<p>The child looked at his customer and stammered, "Today is my first day selling newspapers."</p>
<p>"Then why do you have to sell newspapers?"</p>
<p>"My father has passed away, and there's only my mother at home, working as a maid for others."</p>
<p>"How many have you sold?"</p>
<p>"So far, eight have been bought."</p>
<p>There was no need to ask any further questions. The child is called Fan Renyuan, from Pudong.</p>
<p>Thirteen years old - the age of learning to dance, isn't he a true standard school-age child? While this thousand or so students of the same age were participating in the graduation ceremony inside the Great World, he was selling newspapers at the entrance of the Great World, sustaining his little life.</p>
<p>Lucky ones, even luckier ones, helping others to study is a righteous act of chivalry. May I ask, are you one of the two? (End)</p>

<h3>Viewing the Art Exhibition of the Deaf and Mute</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Hoshi, a young man who is both deaf and mute, has studied painting since childhood. Now, with the cooperation of Xie Bosheng, Mai Yihua, Shen Zuyi, and others, he is publicly exhibiting many of his works in the hall of Nanyang Hospital on Luoyang Road. The "Deaf and Mute Art Exhibition" is a truly unique event. Beethoven's works became more divine after he went deaf in his later years. Mr. Gu Hoshi and others, with their innate imperfections, have instead been able to focus on the study of painting. Although their works have not yet reached the point of perfection, in the reporter's opinion, if given time, their future is very promising. Mr. Gu told the reporter that the purpose of this exhibition is to invite audiences with an artistic eye to visit and provide correct guidance and criticism.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu's works are mainly portraits and still lifes. His portrait of Ms. Li Xianglan, among others, is skillfully and maturely executed, reaching a refined state. The paintings "Apple and Cat," among others, have won awards in the YMCA Art Exhibition. The painting "Mother and Child" has a style similar to that of the French painter Millet, with simple lines and a well-studied perspective.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Gu Hoshi is a top student of the contemporary famous artist Gu Tingkang. No wonder his pastel paintings and oil paintings have a bright and beautiful feel in their use of colors and application of powder.</p>
