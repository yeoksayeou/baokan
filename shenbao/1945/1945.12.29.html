<h3>三外長會議中之決議　確認國民政府領導　建立統一民主中國　重申贊助不干涉政策</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿作日電〕中國政府諒曾接　三强外長會議最後公報之通知，對公報所列各款，當已表示贊同。三强關於中國事件之決議，可別爲下列數類：（一）確認有由重慶之國民政府，領導建立統一而民主之中國之必要。（二）確認有停止中國內亂之必要。（三）確認有擴大民主份子參加政府之必要。（四）盟國不得干涉中國國內事件。〔聯合社莫斯科廿七日電〕三國外長會議對於中國部份之決議如下：</p>
<p>三外長就中國局勢，交換意見。對於成立統一及民主的中國，歸國民政府統治，及停止內戰等，見解從同。並重申贊助不干涉中國內政政策。蘇外長莫洛托夫及美國務卿貝爾納斯，對於蘇美在華駐軍問題，曾會談數次。莫洛托夫氏稱蘇軍已將東北日軍繳械並遺散，但蘇軍徇中國政府之請，延至一九四六年二月一日撤退。貝爾納斯指出美軍駐華，係徇中國政府之請，並提及美國履行初步責任，須實施投降條款，使日軍繳械並予遺散。一俟責任解除或中國政府能責起履行責任，不須美軍協助時，美軍即將撤退。蘇美兩國軍隊履行任務完畢後，應在及早時間內自中國撤退一節，兩外長意見一致。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十八日廣播稱：中國宣傳部長吳國楨頃宣稱：中國政府尚未接獲三强外長會議宣言之全文，故未便宣佈態度。</p>
<p>共同管制日本原爲我國主張</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿八日電〕此間中國人方面對於三强外長協定，尤其是關於中國部份之協定，</p>
<p>表示歡迎，咸望此項協定保障中國對東北之主權，並促進中國之和平與統一，關於美蘇兩國軍隊及早自中國撤退之協定，其意義有二：其一，蘇軍原定於一月三日自東北撤退完竣，勢非遲進不可。其二，一俟日軍繳械及遺散畢事，美軍即將撤退。官方人士稱：彼等將於研究此項協定後，發表意見。某發言人稱：中國包括於聯合國日本管制委員會中，與中願望相符。至於朝鮮問題，中國一向主張朝鮮獨立。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十八日專電〕據自權威方面獲悉：關於盟國共同管制日本一事，蘇聯最初主張由中美英蘇合組委員會，執行管制工作。美方主張之遠東顧問委員會，則包括對日直接作戰各國之代表，但純爲建議機構，無眞接執行或決定政策之權。我政府於十一月遠東顧問委員會開會前，即擬有折衷方案之主張。在上述顧間委員會之外，由中美英蘇合組一日本管制委員會。該會對於若干特定事項（如日本　法問題，日本政府問題等），有決定政策之權。但執行決議以及指揮軍隊之權，仍應屬諸盟軍最高統帥。中國此項折衷方案，大體上曾得美方贊同。此次莫斯科三國外長會議所協定之管制日木方案，大體上即中國之主張。故當美英蘇三外長徽求我方同意時，我方遂欣然復予同意。</p>
<h3>管制日本委員會　並未變更麥克阿瑟統帥權　管理行政上仍居領導地位</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿七日電〕美英蘇三國外長會議今日圓滿結束，並發表公報。關於管制日本，則決定由聯合國十一國代表組織遠東委員會，並由美蘇中英四國組織日本管制委員會。一俟此兩員會組織成立，則日本方面聯合國最高統帥麥克阿瑟將軍大部份任務，即當移交各該委員會負責處理。多帥所當發出之任何指令，槪須交由遠東委員會審查。美國將依據委員會決議負責草擬各項指令，其於日本組織或政府方面根本上改革有關之指令，則必須與委員會磋商。麥帥雖受此等限制，但在管理日本之行政上仍居領導地位，並將祖任四國管制委員會主席。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕　英蘇三國外長會議關於日本之決議，實際上並米變更麥克阿瑟所任聯合國統帥之職權。四國管制日本委員會所有任務，僅備統帥諮議與顧問，而美國爲四委員之一，麥帥又爲委員會主席。三國外長協定雖增加遠東委員會制定政策之權力，但又規定一種表決方法，凡對日決定爲美國所不贊成者，均可加以阻止，故美國可阻止變更麥帥執行各項指令之任何企圖。委員會並保證尊重現有對日管制機構，自美國政府直至最高統帥管轄佔領車隊之指揮系統均在其內。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日合衆電〕一般對三外長會議所宣佈之遠東委員會，及盟國對日委員會二點之主要反響，爲蘇聯要求即在平等共管日本方面，已獲完全成功。遠東委員會之表決程序中，雖有否決權之規定，但蘇聯在對日之久遠政策中，仍可實施相當大之力量。一般專家特別提出，此次協議已限制美政府頒予盟軍最高統帥之訓令，應依照遠東委員會所決定之政策。關於否決欋之規定，類似舊金山會議所規定者，內有一節，爲「遠東委員會之各項決定，不需一致通過即可付諸實施，但至少需經多數代表之通過，並應包括美英蘇中四國代表在內」。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕關於管制日本之決議，華盛頓方面認爲乃係美代表團之重大讓步。右翼人士諒將指出杜魯門總統與貝爾納斯曾反覆堅稱，決不許美國對佔領日本事之最後決定性的發言權遭遇干涉。按照莫斯科會議之決定，駐日盟軍統帥麥克阿瑟將軍，將獲領導的行政責任，但渠將受政策之節制，政策則由投票決定之。大約加以非難者，俱認爲迄今工作順利之佔領管理，將因新辦法而促成混亂狀態。聞英國·中國與蘇聯之佔領軍，不久均將派往日本，但其數殆頗少，而軍事佔領之主要重任，仍將由美國負之。</p>
<h3>國府命令</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿八日電〕國府廿九日令：（一）農林部東南蔴業改進會組織條例，着即廢止，此令。（二）地方官員協助鹽務獎勵條例，着即廢止，此令。</p>
<h3>外部舉行酒會　歡迎馬歇爾</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿八日電〕外部主持歡迎馬歇爾特使鷄尾酒會，定廿九日下午五時舉行，王部長已柬邀政府各部會長官，各國大使·公使·參贊·武官及參政會，各報社負責人等參加。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿八日電〕宋院長馬歇爾特使，可能自重慶抵平，此間正作種種準備。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿八日電〕廿八日爲馬歇爾特使蒞渝第六日，晨間氏於官邸處理公務，午後二時法大使館代辦戴立堂往訪，旋辭去，三時半英大使館代辦亦往訪候，均係友誼拜會性質。五時特使曾召集美大使館代辦羅賓遜及其他高級職員有所談詢。</p>
<h3>「台北號」輪　定元旦下水</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿八日電〕台省公署定元旦下午在基隆港舉行「台北號」輪船下水典禮，屆時陳長官將請各機關代表前往參加，此間學生及民衆團體，並將於元且遊行，遊藝項目正積極籌備中。</p>
<h3>韓對聯合託管制　分勉強接受與反對兩意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社舊金山二十七日合衆電〕代表中韓人民聯盟之韓吉沫告報界稱：朝鮮人民勉强接受盟國對朝鮮設立聯合託管制五年之決定。朝鮮人民，向抱希望能符合開羅宣言之精神，獲得較佳之解決方案，以使朝鮮早日獲得自由與獨立。然爲世界和平及亞洲之政治安定計，吾人拘寗有一綫光明，總較黑暗爲佳之委曲求全精神，以接受此次三國外畏會議之協議。希望列强能立即取消將朝鮮劃分爲二之舉，而能設立臨時委會，準備由朝鮮人民建立之民主政府。</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城二十七日電〕金九領導之韓國非正式政府發言人，今日再度要求立即獲得獨立，反對高麗由盟國聯合託管五年之計劃。</p>
<h3>日侵華戰爭罪犯　酒井將付審判　承認兩度會晤共黨代表</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕侵華日戰爭罪犯酒井隆就逮後，記者特走訪陸軍總司令部發言人，據稱：酒井隆在九一八事變時，曾任天津駐屯軍大隊長，爾後又調天津駐屯軍梅津美治郞之參謀長，當時平·津各次變亂，皆爲其主使，例如二十四年之河北事件，日方要求我國軍隊及黨部撤出河北以及其後策動華北五省自治，皆酒井之所謀。七七抗戰後，酒井以「支那通」之資格，遞升爲華北派遣軍司令官，在中國所犯之罪行，實不可勝數，但於前年已行退伍，故於此次投降中，反默默無聞。然酒井向以侵略中國爲其進取之道，故退伍後仍屢潛入中國，以進行非法之勾當，十一月上旬，何總司令出巡北平時，曾獲悉酒井正在進行擾亂華北之重大陰謀，當即下令調查緝捕，因酒井行蹤詭密，未能立時捕獲。十一月二十九日，何總司令在重慶招待記者時，亦曾說明酒井勾結中共，正在查究事實，中共爲粉飾其罪行，遂於十二月十一日以新華社延安電甲明，酒井中將並朱參加共產軍作戰。十二月十三日，重慶新華日報進一步反誣何總司令在北平時，曾與酒井會談，此種欺騙同胞之行爲，實不値一駁。十二月上旬。何總司令復申前令，電十一戰區孫長官迎仲迅速搜捕，同時並電調華北日本聯絡參謀高橋來京詳，詢酒井與中共勾結情形，高橋於十二月十二日到京，承認酒井確曾與中共不斷聯絡，並說出酒井隆藏匿地址。十二月中，孫長官將酒井隆捕獲，派員押解抵京，初步審問結果，酒井直認企圖擾亂華北不諱，據供，曾於九月七日十一日兩次前往北平郊外黑龍潭西數公里溫泉村之古寺，與中共代表張學詩商談合作事，但因中共要求酒井設法使華北日軍拒降，當時平津日軍恐違反波茨坦宣言及蔣委員長之命令，影響日本整個國運前途，未敢接受，同時國軍迅速空運到達平津，酒井與中共之密商進行乃未能實現。但酒井尙不死心，潛居北平西郊，以圖死灰復燃，卒爲我軍逮捕解京，現覊押南京區憲兵司令部，酒井爲戰爭罪犯之一，將與其他日本戰爭罪犯一併提付審判。</p>
<h3>津漢奸預審　即解送法院</h3>
<p>〔中央社天津廿八日電〕在津被拘之漢奸，仍在分別覊押中，彼等已經過預審，聞將於短期內移送法院，公開審訊。河北高等法院津分院，尙未收到人民檢舉之漢奸案件，惟該院已對前被拘捕之偽河北高等法院長劉毓璋等提起公訴。</p>
<h3>商務局准成立　下將設貿易所</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶航訊〕經濟部新設商務局，已奉准成立，內定李幹，費福燾分任局長·副局長·該局組識龐大，下將設貿易所，經管國際貿易事項及復興商業公司未了業務，所長一職，將由費氏兼任，至於職員中之一部將視，需要由前貿易委會及復興公司職員中留任。</p>

<h3>共產黨提停戰建議　政府正考慮答覆　國共二次會談定今日舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿八日廣播稱：中國國民黨與共黨之第一日談判，結果甚佳。中國宣傳部長吳國楨宣稱：蔣委員長正在審閱共黨所提之「停戰」。數日內可答復，國共第二次會談，已定廿九日舉行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿八日廣播稱：據可靠消息，中國共產已向政府提出三項主要要求，另八項附帶要求，三項主要要求之內容如下：（一）中國及東北境內雙方立即無條件停止開火。（二）各黨間一切軍事，政治問題，可于完全停戰後解決。（三）由國共兩黨及中立派組織混合國，赴戰爭地點視察。八項附帶要求內容如下：（一）政治協商會議，應于一月一日開會。（二）立即着手籌備召開此項會議。（三）政治協商會秘書長須係非政府官員。（四）新加坡財主華僑陳喜庚，應以無黨無派資格參加政治協商會議。（五）（電碼不明）（六）新聞完全自由。（七）釋放政治犯（包括張學良與葉挺）。（八）（播音中斷，內容不明）。傳中中央政府對以上各要求並不反對。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿八日電〕宣傳部長吳國楨今日宣稱：政府當局已接疲共產黨之停戰建議，現方考慮答覆中。吳氏稱：共產黨提出停之唯一戰理由，乃因彼等曾攻擊中央軍而遭挫敗，目下已自知其軍事力量之薄弱，「故突然改變態度矣」。又稱：「共產黨先前以爲可擊敗我人，而目前態度之改變，乃實現陶結最可喜之徵象」。吳氏指陳：政府早在十月卅一日即提出停戰，我人認爲遺憾者，共產黨建議並未提及兩項緊要問題，即鐵路交通之恢復與日本軍民之遺送返國。在過去四個月中，共產軍曾攻擊綏　省之歸綏與包頭，山東省之滕縣，湖北省之襄陽，共軍到處被擊潰，而蒙重大損失。</p>

<h3>從秋望到冬從天空望到大地　昆義民還鄉心切</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員張軍</p>
<p>據昆明市府調查：昆市人口在抗戰勝利後數月內，當無顯著的減少。又據參政員褚輔成先生估計：留在昆市的義民，約有十萬人以上。十萬人的心，迫切地期待着回到那遙遠的破碎的家鄕。十萬人的目光，注視着每一個可能還鄉的機會或關係，可是，從秋望到冬，從天空看到大地，其結果，大多數人還是無法離開昆明。</p>
<p>羨煞重慶義民　駕木筏順流而下</p>
<p>他們看到重慶的報紙，獲悉陪都的義民，可以利用原始式的交通工具，駕木筏，冒危險，順江而下，他們認爲重慶的義民是幸福的。昆市人口二十入萬，義民約佔三分之一。義民的復員問題，自然不應忽視，但是他們期待了三個月，才由參政員　輔成先生發起，邀集了各有關機關，商討義民還鄕的事，把復員當作救濟，慢慢的開始了輸送工作。</p>
<p>黃金美鈔螃蟹　從空中飛抵昆明</p>
<p>昆市義民還鄕之路，說來也有三條：首從天空談起，除昆渝，昆筑兩航綫外，昆廣·昆越兩航綫，業已試航成功·航運固然已經四通了，然而我們只見河內的越幣，廣州的黃金與螃蟹龍蝦，上海的貨物和美鈔，經常的光顧到昆明，最近尚有大批黃金飛渡台灣海峽來昆，致使昆市金價，連日大跌。神通廣大的商人，經常可在天空飛去飛來，普通養民的復員，目前只好陷人一籌莫展的困境。</p>
<p>西南公路專車　每月輸送兩千人</p>
<p>第二條還鄕之路，當推西南公路。在過去四月內，循此路而還鄕的義民，雖無正確統計，可能在一萬人左右。大隊軍車與公商車輛，經常行駛此路，義民甘作黃魚還鄕者，爲數不少。但是專爲輸送義民還鄕的車輛，直至十一月廿八日，始告離昆。戰時運輸局雲南分局，撥專車五十輛，担任此項工作。最高的估計，每月只能輸送兩千人。假使滯留在昆市的十萬義民，完全依賴這種輸送辦法而還鄕，大槪需時約四年。遝蝓局在昆存有舊車六百輛，最近擬修復二百輛，作爲輸送義民的工具。但此事何日可告實現，尚不得而知。警備總部登記昆市公私車輛，截至十二月廿二止，已達四千餘部，可見目前所缺乏者，實非汽車而係汽油人員與決心。</p>
<p>滇越鐵道待修　徒令人望路興歡</p>
<p>還鄉的第三條路，爲滇越鐵路，多少　民在熱切地期望着此路之早日修復，迄今還是困難重重，令人望路興嘆。十一月十四日，滇省臨參會，通過一個建議案，略謂滇越鐵路，由芷村至河口一段，長不過一百四十公里，實有迅速修復之必要。至於此段路軌，查有滇緬同蒲兩路鐵軌材料，分存於香港仰光者甚多，移緩救急，應予撥用。十一月十七日，滇省府第二次招待記者會中，李代主席宗黃答記者稱：復員與救濟所需的交通工具，由建廳與省公路局，切實準備，並壘諸中央在六個月內修復滇越鐵路，使滇境廿五萬外來人士，得以早日還鄉。</p>
<p>修復路軌橋樑　需欵二十萬萬元</p>
<p>記者從滇越鐵路管理處方面獲悉：該路從碧色寨至河口，一百七十八公里鐵軌，均因戰事關係而拆毀，所有橋樑亦已全部炸壞，修復工程浩大，預算約　款二十萬萬元，需時約十月至一年。據十二月十五日訊：交通部首擬修復此路線上被破壞之　橉，並已撥發一部份經費，交由該路管理處迅速辦理。該處現已派工務組長赴河內，購備洋灰等材料，這一條復員的大道，也許可於明年春興工搆築。</p>

<h3>和馬帥在一起　合奏巴山府雨曲　抵渝後首次記者招待會速寫</h3>
<p>我們的國賓馬歇爾元帥，在中外人士一致熱烈翹盼之中，已經從佛士尼里的利斯堡鄕村，到華盛頓，到上海，到南京，然後於二十二日飛抵重慶，詳情已見本報特派員報這文字。馬帥抵渝後二日（二十四日）即舉行了中外記者招待會，當特赴會記者不下六十餘人，邊笑邊談，全塲空氣至爲融洽熱鬧，下面這一篇詩意蔥蘢的報道，諒爲讀者所密切注意的罷。（編者）</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥在重慶，是住在怡園臨時官邸，怡國，原來是宋院長的私邸；居里，威爾基，威爾遜，赫爾利許多位在中美友好滕史上，都寫下過他們偉大成就的美國貴賓們，先後都曾經在那裏居住過的。</p>
<p>二十四日上午，馬歇爾元帥舉行抵渝後之首次中外記者招待會。約定的時間是九點四十五分，八點五十分左右，記者們已紛紛冒着冷雨，到達了兩浮支路的美國大使館。</p>
<p>九點四十分，馬歇爾元帥來了，他依舊穿着當天下飛機時的衣服。他先同隨員們穿過使館辦公望門前的空地，去眺望那烟雨濛　中的嘉陵江，記者們在走廊裏等候着他。三分鐘後，他同着隨員們走來，在門外脫下外衣，進門首先用英語向記者們招呼着：「早安！」穿過記者們閃開的ｇ　條甬道，走到另一個房間裏。</p>
<p>跟着，使館職員招呼記者們進去，這是一間並不太大，面向着陽光的屋子，六十餘位中外記者，塞得滿滿的。</p>
<p>權成一幅　偉麗畫面</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥斜依在的璧爐邊，璧爐裏的光焰熊熊，爐頂的　璧上，　有一張大幅的太平　鐵爭地國。記者今天更淸柝的看到了這位　　幗　，決勝於兩洋之上的元帥，他斜梳着的頭髮，已完全銀白，但容光仍然是恢發而年有，胸前配着的三排　章，和肩頭白色的五星元帥肩章，都是記述着他從第一次世界到第二次世界大戰勝利的豐功殊勳，在元帥左手的小指上，戴着一只金鑲的大寶石戒指。這紅色的火熖，大幅的作戰地圖，無帥的白髮，威容，勳章，和寶石戒指……等，構成了一幅偉麗無比的畫面。</p>
<p>「諸位小姐！先生！」站在留前的美大使館羅賓遜代辦首先說話了。他向記者們作簡單的介紹以後，就請元帥講話。</p>
<p>兩條勁腿　善踢惡魔</p>
<p>壁爐裏的火，着得很旺，在馬歇爾元帥要說話之前，一團赤紅燃燒着的焦炭，從爐內滾了出來，元帥用皮鞋把它踢進去，馬帥早年是有名的足球健將，今天在這小屋裏，記者看到了他不自覺的表演。同時，這裏是一個現成的比喩：告訴世界上玩火者們，馬歇爾元帥雄勁的兩條腿，隨時都在等待着要把你們踢進火爐裏去的。</p>
<p>「諸位！」馬歇爾元帥說：「今天我們在這裏見面，我感到非常歡喜！感謝你們今天到了這麼多人，只可惜這間房子太小。關於美國的對華政策，杜魯門總統發表過談話，諸位都已經知道，我今天在道裏不願意說甚麼，你們有甚麼問題，我現在也不能回答，因爲我對中國的認識很少，對中國的許多事情，都是最近才學習的」。</p>
<p>中美兩國　彼此關懷</p>
<p>他接着又說：「不過，在這次戰期間，美國對華的物貿和軍事的援助，我很淸楚，我以前曾經到過華北的北平‘天津·秦皇島·山海關一帶。上海·南京和重慶，都還是第一次到，我很想念中國，美國的政府和人民也都懷念中國，我相信中國的政府和人民，也都同樣懷念着美國的。」馬歇爾元帥以緩慢眞摯的語調講着，「現在，我喜歡聽聽你們問些甚麼問題。」</p>
<p>「元帥在重慶將要停留多久？」一位中國記者問。</p>
<p>「這個我還不知道。」</p>
<p>是否赴延　尚未考慮</p>
<p>「是否要到延安去？」記者問</p>
<p>「關於這事，我尚未考慮。」</p>
<p>「駐華美軍在甚麼時候可以撤退？」</p>
<p>「還不知道！」</p>
<p>在許多不能答覆的問題之後，這個問題使馬歇爾元帥和新聞記者們一起大笑起來。</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥說：「這個我可以答覆你，中午我應　蔣主席和夫人的邀宴，下午我要參加美國大使館的鷄尾酒會。」</p>
<p>問題到這裏爲止，馬歇爾元帥向着站在寫字　旁邊的羅賓遜代辦招呼一下，走向招待室的門外，記者們跟隨着出去。</p>
<p>翻閱華報　興趣盎然</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥站立在門口，同記者們一一握手，並問每一個人是代表那一個報紙？記者們一個個向他道謝。記者這時特贈他報紙兩份，　帥翻閱注視，極感興趣</p>
<p>在使館辦公室的大樓前，馬歇爾元帥和記者們合攝了一張照片，結束了這次招待會。從二十二日十二時十五分，到現在，馬歇爾元帥到重慶整整兩天半，他給重慶中美人士的印象，是極其深刻的，</p>
<p>狂歡之外　再加狂歡</p>
<p>記者執筆寫成這篇通訊時，勝利後的第一個聖誕，窗外正落着富於詩意的「巴山夜雨」，且讓我們這位來自太平洋彼岸的貴賓，親身嘗味這葱籠的詩意吧！今年的重慶聖誔之夜，在中美人士共同的記憶中，是狂歡中加上了一層狂歡的。</p>
<p>（聖誕夜，十二時，趙浩生寄自重慶。）</p>
<h3>蘇聯農業　損失統計</h3>
<p>德國佔領者給予蘇維埃農業的損失數字，眞是駭人。根據書面憑據，國立德國法西斯侵略者暴行調查特別委員會估計，單是集體農塲的損失，就達一八一、〇〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇布·此外，機械與曳司機站的損失，達數十萬億盧布。</p>
<p>德國法西斯侵略者摧毀他們所佔領的蘇維埃領土上的集體與國營農塲，機械與曳引機站，是按照預定的計劃進行的，德軍在蘇維埃集體農塲與團營農塲機械與曳引機站毀壞，奪取或運返本國者，有曳引機十三萬七千架。收割機四萬架。耘耕工具約四百萬架。播種機廿六萬五千架與收機機八十八萬五千架。</p>
<p>德軍把集體農塲的農學實驗室，差不多全部毀壞，侵略者還給予家畜飼養業巨大的損失。他們殺死或運回　國者七百萬頭的馬，一千七百萬頭的牛，數千萬頭的羊。（美新譯）</p>

<h3>三强外長會議的成就</h3>
<p>三强外長會議於二十七日結束於蘇京，計自本月十五日召開以來，爲時達十有二日·此一會議之召開，各方因鑒於十月中五强外長會議之失敗，蘇聯之拒絕參加遠東顧問委員會，以及關於管制原子能的難題，雖希望殷切，初不敢抱有過分樂觀的期待。然而這十二天來，莫斯科的三强外長會議，却始終在和諧協調的氛圍中進行，終而成立若干重要的協議，這實在是一件足以令人欣慰的事。</p>
<p>據二十八日同時在莫斯科，華盛頓，倫敦三地發表的三强外長會議的公報，這次會議有如下的重要協議：（一）設立遠東委員會以代替現有之遠東顧問委員會，並設一中蘇英美之四國委員會以管制日本，（二）美蘇兩國軍隊於在華任務完畢後應於最短期內撤離中國：（三）又持重慶國民政府實施民主政治；（四）設立管理原子能委員會，保障其應用於和平目標；（五）關於朝鮮局勢，由美蘇兩軍司令部於兩星期內進行協商組織聯合委員會協助朝鮮臨時政府之建立；（六）英美承認羅馬尼亞及保加利亞之條件等等。在這以外，若干問題可能被提出討論；但其未列入公布的成果內，不是說此外另有密約，似僅止於交換意見，而未成立有若何協議。然即就已公布之成果而言，這次三强外長會議收穫之豐滿，誠出乎一般之預料。此乃三强對處理世界局勢衷心合作之又一明證；吾人甚願這種和諧協調的合作精神，能够繼續發揚光大下去。</p>
<p>可是我們於贖了三强外長會議的公布以後，誠不免感觸多端。三强外長會議有關於中國的協議，而我國竟無代表參加其間。我們不否認三强外長會議對中國的協議是相當明智的；我們覺得遺憾的是，我國於長期抗戰後國際地位已提高，而國內尚有不知民族利益爲重的人從事於內爭，致使關於中國的局勢也被列入爲三强外長會議的議程。凡有眞心的人，對此實應感覺慚愧，今三强洞察我國局勢，一致協議支持國民政府實施民主政治；陰謀破壞中國統一，以及企圖顚覆國民政府的野心家，當應有所歛跡。</p>
<p>關於共同管制日本的問題，我們曾指出這一問題不是在原則上有歧見，而是執行上的困難。日寇的被擊潰，得力於美國軍力者自不在少，可是中蘇美也都有貢獻·就中我國抗拒日本侵略，歷時最久，犧牲最大，對於共同管制日本，原則上自極贊成，但所謂共同管制，可能有各種不同的解釋。麥帥之在東京是以聯軍最高統帥，而不是以美軍最高統帥，執行其任務的，故麥帥本身已代表共同管制。對德的共同管制是英美法蘇劃區而治，雖有一個共同管制委員會，實際上，却等於形同虛設。此爲盟國共同管制戰敗德國的例子。聞蘇軍方面曾要求派兵占領北海道，而麥帥僅允若輩進據九州。所謂共同管制日本，是否將循共同管制戰敗德國的先例，亦是一個執行上的問題。再則中美英蘇可各派軍隊至日本，不劃分各該國的占領區，而以整個日本爲對象共同加以管制。凡此，都是共同管制日本可能引起的不同解釋。我們以爲麥帥旣以聯軍最高統帥的名義進據日本，對日作戰的各主要盟國，應以此爲中心加强麥帥的權力，而不應重蹈共同管制德國的覆轍，實行分區占領的政策。今三强外長會議對於共同管制日本的協議，可謂朝此方向行進的良好步驟。</p>
<p>關於朝鮮的獨立，開羅會錢旣有明白的昭告，今戰爭勝利完遂，自應將開羅會議的諾言，付諸實施。最近朝鮮方面的局勢，似頗令人失望。美蘇兩軍占領區的存在，使朝鮮遭遇了腰斬。北緯三十八度的分界，在朝鮮人民中是一宗極慘痛的創傷。這種不自然的宰割，雖也許是軍事上一種不可避免的結果，但於朝鮮民族的生存上實是一種隱憂。三强外長會議對於朝鮮的協議，於顧全事實之中，不忘開羅會議所昭示之精神，實爲一大成就。聯合委員會目前惟一緊迫的工作，便在如何溝通不致蘇美兩軍的占領區，使這種人爲的壁壘得以消除；然後朝鮮纔能走上民主獨立的大道。</p>
<p>關於原子能的問題，這次三强外長會議能够成立協議，自亦極可欣幸。過去三强間對於原子能的問題，所見似頗參差。其實問題的核心不是在保持或公開原子能使用的秘密，而是如何管制原子能的使用。從遠處着想，保持原子能使用的秘密是不可能的；因此，要求原子能使用秘密的公開也就仿佛覺得是多事。問題是在管制。今英斯科會議旣協議組織國際委員會來處理關於原子能使用上的問題，深信必能得有效的管制。</p>
<p>三强外長會議曾有「三强獨裁會議」之變。此雖語近中傷，然就現實的觀點，三强外長會議的召開，能够彼此交換意見，對若干主要問題成立協議，實大有裨於國際局勢的安定。在有關中法兩國利益的時候，兩國雖與莫斯科保持密切接觸，終未能積極參加發表意見，不無遺憾。世界秩序的重建，須要聯合國的一致協力。這次三强外長會議爲國際合作樹立了良好的規範，願　種精神能保持於久遠，世界前途，人類幸福，胥利賴之。</p>

<h3>美鈔求過於供　金價繼續騰漲　公債股票一路上升</h3>
<p>烚赤昨繼續向榮，陪都行市亦有報昇，彼此互相呼應，美鈔仍爲各方吸納目標，異常堅挺，金市得其助力不少，自晨開八一萬五後，盤旋趨漲，午刻忽有散空補進，昇至八三萬外，午後突有大戶了結，人心驟起恐慌，交易雖少，一時缺乏受主，曾退至八一萬以內，趁低游資吸收，結果較之前收仍漲一萬一，銀樓飾金掛入萬七，紋銀六百元，銀元仍在四百五左右盤旋，暗拆仍在一角左右，國曆歲尾，銀行方面剩餘資金頗多吸收，業中大戶則進出不一，趨勢遂轉恍惚。</p>
<p>美鈔繼續受人愛戴，求過於供，自晨開一三九五元後，迂緩上升，午刻漲至一四四〇元，午後則因金價回小，錢兌業實貨被迫流出，一度退至一四一〇元以下，結果則較前收漲三十五元，港票老平新疲，老貨上塲曾好至二六〇元左右，新貨則因受戶離去，突形供過於求，結果與前收相較，老貨未更，新貨則回跌三元。</p>
<p>公債有銀錢業餘資金前來點綴，業中人興高彩烈，買氣忽熾，丙種晨開即升爲七二〇元，此後即一路上昇，迨見八〇五元高價後，始趨盤旋，結果較前收回昇四十元至一百零五元不等。</p>
<p>華股仍爲游資所垂靑，供過於求，各冷門股亦繼續有人吸收，各股問差價亦再軋近，結果較前收計永紗漲三十五元，美亞二十五元，新光二元半，勤興景福各二元，各方對股市漸漸搜購冷門股，取其價值便宜也。</p>
<p>外股旣有華股之刺激，又得美鈔之助力，遂再向榮，結果怡紗再昇一百二十元，怡啤四十元，紙業四十元，冷門各股亦普遍漲起半成至一成不等，橡皮股僅有少數做開，較爲沉寂。</p>
<h3>美棉織品價格　暫不撤消管理</h3>
<p>（路透社二十八日紐約電）據悉，對於棉織品之物價管理，於一九四六年六月以前，恐尚無撤銷希望，因戰爭關係，人力大感不足，棉織品出產量低落，十二月份似更見悽慘，據估計，各廠一九四五年份定貨，約須半月時間，可逐一交淸云。</p>

<h3>粳秈再見下挫</h3>
<p>黃豆生仁豆油均漲</p>
<p>米市南帮來源仍湧，本市消化依然不振，粳米秈米再見下挫二三百元，惟羊秈貨稀尚挺，白元貨多，續小三四百元，陰元來貨頗旺，供過於求，狂小六七百元，尚少受主，收盤早薄稻靑島帮揀巧略取，交易不多，麵粉外消轉淡，本市因第二期平價粉續發，納胃仍懈，價較昨回疲數十元至百元，黃豆零化甚股，價漲二三百元，油市以甬帮問津，消化尚活，價升千元，豆餅銷細下游，價跌一二百元，麩皮堅挺，生仁店銷異常活潑，求過於供，再漲二千元，酒市亦因年關在即，再升五百元。</p>

<h3>煤塊市價續漲　柴炭亦漸見轉機</h3>
<p>白煤節塊繼續暢銷，同業存底素薄，貨主見機扳價，市價續見昂騰，烟煤各貨穩定逾恒，價乏榮辱，柴炭外洋到船因天時風向等影響頓見銳减，僅內河船尚有少數運滬，是以市况漸見轉機，行情逐漸堅俏，</p>
<h3>建築材料暢銷　出貨多—行情平</h3>
<p>建築材料如水泥柏油油毛　柏油紙等銷路甚暢，因有政府機關採辦，而各界修理廠房者，亦頗有購進，然因堆棧存貨絡續散出不少，故價格並未見佳。</p>

<h3>香港英商復業　接受三個月定單　請英匯易於美滙</h3>
<p>〔香港訊〕香港商務，確已欣欣向榮，各洋行紛紛籌備復業，有一部份且已開始接受貨客三個月期之定單，表示三個月後即有貨運到。定單中以建築器材，木料，銅鐵及疋頭，汽車，日用品物爲多，一般商人雖趨向於商。但因購買外匯，英匯比美匯爲多，英商接受定單較多，緣香港政府爲扶助英商，凡向英鎊集團區域輸入貨物，即可逕備證明向銀行申請英鎊外匯，而申請美匯，則須先向當局申請核准，然後方得向銀行申請，未免略受限制。但美商方面之競爭甚爲積極，聞美國政府將派商業專商駐港，以便籌劃一切。香港四大公司已派代表黃永善遄赴澳洲，代表四公司採辦貨物云。</p>

<h3>中央農業試騐塲</h3>
<p>— 陳佳洱</p>
<p>靑北公路是成渝公路的支路；從靑木關沿着靑北公路向北行，距離北碚有四公里之遙，那兒有一個小小的市集，叫做天生橋，也是靑北公路上的一個車站。如果，就在這兒從公路車上跳下，在眼前展開的，是一片廣大的美麗的農塲——中央農業試騐塲。</p>
<p>去年五月間，國賓美國前副總統華萊士先生，到了北碚，未去以風景著名的北溫泉，却特地來此參觀，頗加讚美，允予回國後盡力協助，俾資聯繫而利發展。</p>
<p>中央農業試騐塲不單純是個農塲，也是一個學術研究機關，地址在縉雲山麓，試騐稻·麥·豆·棉·瓜·果·菜蔬的種植。對於土壤·肥料·病害·改良種十等等，一邊研究，一邊實地試騐，極有成績。幾年來不僅對於農事上多所發明，更因爲收穫的良好，影響及附近一帶農民對於農業的自動改善，這是最值得稱道的。他們收穫的蕃茄，便有普通菜碗那麼大，色澤紅潤可愛；對於北碚附近出產的一種廣柑，也在試騐改進中，務期色·香·味與美國所出的Sunkist相媲美。</p>
<p>工作人員，勞心兼勞力，用腦復用手。有時在顯微鏡下觀察害蟲，有時在暖房裏培養細菌，用筆來描繪害蟲及細萬的形態，記載它們變化的過程；還在表格上畫着曲線，把一切研究所得的記錄下來。有時也荷鋤拖犁在田間工作，更改良農具以便應用，增進工作的效能。</p>
<p>這裏眞是一片新天地；要是國內多辦幾個這樣學術化的農塲，對於整個農業一定大有進步，不愁在建國階段中重工業沒有基礎了。</p>

<p>平民住宅</p>
<p>本市淪陷期間，房屋被燬者，不可勝計，以致一般平民，牽多於空地上搭蓋簡陋棚屋，以作客身之所，惟所用材料多以竹木蘆蓆等類，草早私建，極易引起火災，危及生命，而對衛生亦多澳視，因此訂有私建棚屋暫行取締辦法及臨時棚屋建造暫行辦法，逐步取締，尤以築於下水道上妨礙疏濬工作者，更屬刻不容緩，惟一且拆除而無適當救濟辦法，勢必使之流離失所，而失顧念平民生活之本旨。特經昨日市政會議決定，本市區內　建平民住宅計劃，其建造辦法，分三步進行，（一）加建平民邨，分甲等一千幢，乙等二千種，共三千幢，均以每幢一戶爲限。（二）恢復其美路·中山路·普善路·斜土路各已毀壞之平民邨，就原有基地，加以重建，甲種一百九十四幢，乙種三百十六幢，此外幷修復上述各處各現有平民邨。</p>

<h3>七十餘萬日僑俘　即將來滬集中</h3>
<p>上海港口運輸司令部，爲辦理遺　華中各地日本僑俘，已於日前正式成立。關於遣歸日僑俘槪况，昨據兼司令謝灝　少將語中央社記者稱，刻下散居於華中各地之日僑俘總數，共爲七十三萬三千一百三十四名，即將先後來滬渠中，候輪遣歸。目前已經遣歸者，已有三批，共載運日僑俘一萬一千一百五十名東返。又有美國登陸船六艘，本預定昨日來滬，戴送第四批日俘六千名回日，惟該輪昨日未到，約今日可以抵此。目明年一月起，每月將有大小不同之各式船隻六十艘以上，專供運輸日僑俘歸國之用。因中美當局現均切望能於最短期內，將此項日人遣送返國。爲達到此目的，美軍上海港口司令部，及中國戰區美軍總部，正與我上海港口運輸司令部，密切合作，協同進行云云。又關於調查日戰爭罪犯問題，據謝氏談，刻擬予遣歸之日人名單，當先交戰爭罪犯偵查處，加以檢討，然後將准予回國之日人，在指定地點集中。現在使用之集中地點，爲前上海市政府舊址。彼等之行李，私人物件及身體，由海關關員警察及憲兵，會同檢查。檢查完畢，有卡車將行李婦孺運至虬江碼頭登船，男子則步行至埠云。</p>

<h3>各國在我境內　不得行使逮捕權　外部辦事處陳國廉之表示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者以連日報載法國駐滬總領事會逮捕在滬之法國納粹份子十餘人一事，特走訪外交部駐滬辦事處主任陳國廉，承陳氏答稱：各國在華領事裁判權，早經宣佈取消，且各有關國家，亦早已先後與我國</p>
<p>訂立新約</p>
<p>其未與我國訂立新約或一二未經宣佈取銷在華領事裁判權之國家，其在華領事裁判權是否仍屬存在，技術上似尚有疑誤，然此亦僅屬疑誤而已，蓋原則上此類國家，亦早經認爲無復享有是項特殊待遇，故依附於領事裁判權而獲片面存在之副產品，如從前日本之領事警察，當然不許保有，更絕對不准在我國境活動。至於年前盟國因與我國駢肩對敵作戰，爲便利海外駐軍之管理起見，對彼此駐在對方國境軍隊之管轄問題，曾訂有協定，我國與英美即曾訂立，但此純係基於戰時需要，且爲絕對</p>
<p>互惠性質</p>
<p>例如我國軍隊之駐在印緬及其他英美國境或麗地者，即享有此種待遇，法國與我國並無此類似協定，且其在華之领事裁判權，亦經認爲取銷，果如報載所稱，竟有在我國境內行使逮捕權之事實，常屬侵權違法，而應負法律上之責任。惟此事陳氏本人亦僅見報載，經過情形，正待會同有關當局澈查，一經查明屬實，政府常依法處置。</p>
<p>又訊：該處次於明年元旦，正式在黃浦路前日本領事館舊址開始辦公，該處辦事人買，刻正由渝來滬途中，目前工作，偏重於敵僞外交行政機構及其產業之接收與處理，一俟處址設定，人手充裕後，即將舉辦簽証及簽發護照等事宜。</p>

<h3>海面障礙未肅清　輪期展延</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英國遠東船務經理處，經理之太古公司北海輪，戰後初次由港經汕頭來滬，預定二十七日到埠，嗣改於昨日進口，昨據該經理宣布今晨八時可到，因海面障礙物未盡肅淸，行駛較緩，船期不能確定。該輪由滬駛溝，原定卅日起椗，因遲到昨亦改期月底結關，元旦出口駛港。該經理處之英輪卜羅米席斯號，由美賓德萊埠，裝儎救濟麥六千七百餘包運華，預定廿七日即可抵滬，但至傍晚無進口消息，忽據該經理稱：該輪改今日可到埠，昨日又據航業界確息，該輪前日駛至距吳淞口九十浬，佘山洋而附近，忽然發生行駛困難，詳情未悉，恐今亦難進口。</p>

<p>黃洲附近燈船擱淺</p>
<p>長江航道，黃洲附近燈船擱淺，漢口水位退落，茲據航業界接漢口來電，據海關長江巡江事務處，臨時航船佈告，燈船現擱淺沙，上自黃洲寶塔，現該燈船擱沙方位，爲三〇六度二·八二浬，現用爲岸上航行標誌，懸點六等透光燈，上行船隻，與左岸相距三鏈，駛過黃洲下碼頭後，應將已之左舷與燈船之右舷，相距三鏈，駛過各船隻，於該燈船未另行佈告前，應於畫間行駛。該處水位本月廿三日爲十七尺，漢口水位爲九尺七寸，請轉知上駛各船等情，各航業機關，得訊後已通告各輪船長注意。又悉北洋天津白河，秦皇島等河道，每屆冬令，水道結冰，航行停頓，進出口船隻，祇能停泊口外，但今年適異，至今尚能行駛，未曾冰凍。</p>
<p>南洋航線規定票價</p>
<p>招商局對於南洋航綫，將定於日內通航，規定票價如下：（一）由滬至夏門：特等三三四五〇，頭等三二八〇〇，二等一五五五〇，三等九七五〇，四等六六〇〇。（二）由滬至汕頭：特等三九九五〇，頭等二七三五〇，二等一八六〇〇，三等一一六〇〇，四等八七五〇。（三）由滬至香港：特等四九一〇〇，頭等三三六五〇，二等二二九〇〇，三等一四二五〇，四等九六五〇。（四）由滬至廣州：特等五四一〇〇，頭等三七〇五〇，二等二五二〇〇，三等一五八〇〇，四等一〇七〇〇。</p>

<p>五期平賣布發現黃牛黨</p>
<p>第五期平價布匹，南京路五大公司，日來已行發售三日，購者甚爲擁擠，情形與第四期發售時不同，原因有二：一爲上期所訂貨價太高，各公司所領之漂白布，至今未能售罄，近正向敵僞產業處理局請示處理辦法。一因其時正屆外匯金價下落，購者觀望。惟各公司已發現有黃牛黨擠購，昨日上午大新公司方面，即以黃牛黨之關係，該公司平賣塲口之鐵門，因被擠壞，更有兩人受傷，一爲兒童名妙法，美新襯衫廠學徒，係額骨及齒，一爲女子壓傷足骨，均送仁濟醫院救治。至黃牛黨所擠購之布，爲喇叭簡牌細布，每人每次八千元得購念丈，購後出公司門即有人以一萬一千元收購而去，甚望當局嚴法取締。</p>

<h3>台農林處長抵滬　談肥料缺乏</h3>
<p>記者昨午訪晤甫由台飛滬之台灣省農林處長趙蓮芳，叩詢關於台灣之農林情事，承答如下：（一）台灣本年度米穀生產量，約爲四百九十萬台石左右，（每石約合市石一·八），戰前之生產量，爲九百五十萬餘台石。產量之减少原因，爲肥料缺乏，雨水欠調，農工被征缺少，而全台灣食消耗量約爲六百四十萬台石，故台米自供尚嫌不足。（二）台省農民，約三百餘萬，工作方式與我江浙一帶相仿，惟已有應用化學肥料之習慣。（三）所產米糧質地甚佳。與我江南所產粳米相仿。（四）全台農田所需化學肥料爲數十萬噸，往年均由日本輸入，現已斷絕來源。（五）爲擴展米穀生產，已儘量將蔗糖耕地面積縮小，（六）此來之主要任務，爲籌商解決台灣之肥料問題，定於下星期初返台。</p>
<h3>卅五年元旦轉瞬即屆　各界正籌備盛大慶祝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕勝利後第一個元旦，三日後即將來臨。木市各界頃正籌備熱烈慶祝，以表示對民族前途，及今後建國工作之熱誠。黨政軍聯席會議已於前日決定，慰勞盟軍及留華美軍之辦法，屆時除將普遍贈送慰勞物品外，市政當局並將招待盟軍將士歡聚，以酬謝彼等爲盟國作戰，及留華期間之辛勞與功績。市府及所屬各局處爲加緊工作，僅於元旦休假一天，各業亦同此例，蓋彼等不願放棄此良好之交易機會也。惟銀錢業因須辦理年終決算，仍將循例休假三天，四日起照常營業。各電影院競選最精彩之新片，以娛來賓，京劇院及話劇塲均將加演日戲，市體育會主辦之足球聯賽，亦將於元旦日展開第一塲大戰。市民正各籌算將往何處消磨此狂一歡之假期，以一傾彼等八年來所受之苦悶。近日外界曾傳除夕及新年假期內將撤除宵禁，本報記者特向負責方面探悉，並無其事。惟大除夕將仿耶誕例，發給特別通行證，除盟邦軍民外，國人凡有正當理由者，亦可向市府申請發給。無通行證者仍將嚴禁於宵禁時期中通行，希市民加以注意。</p>

<p>三大原則</p>
<p>孫縣長致詞，謂抗戰八年，浙省各縣大部份倫陷，數百萬民衆在水深火熱之中，本人自當遵率中央命令，與地方輿情，盡力以赴，辦理救濟工作，有三個原則：（一）迅速，把各項救濟物品，很快的分配到需要救濟的對象。（二）公平，眞正有救濟必要的人，我們救濟他，生活情况還好，而想法謀取救濟品的人，我們是絕對不予救濟的。（三）普遍，普遍的救濟災苦大衆。</p>
<p>救濟要點</p>
<p>對於浙閩方面，本署目前有幾件重要事情要辦的：（一）撲滅鼠疫與瘧疾，（二）救濟糧荒，（三）農業漁業之復興工作。此外對於海鹽附近各縣之堤塘，亦在計劃修理，以免水災。旋各鄉會代表發表意見。紹與代表希望救濟工作深入鄕間，鄕鎭重於城市。嘉興代表謂嘉興需要桑苗·蠶種·與肥田粉。台州代表謂我們需要藥品和棉種。定海代表呼籲救濟定海一帶漁民。</p>

<h3>楊昌基昨審結　定期宣判　曾充敵憲佐作惡多端</h3>
<p>漢奸楊昌基，當敵僞時代，曾充任敵北站憲兵隊憲佐有年，專在北火車站實施檢查行李貨物之責，對於往來客商，所有名貴行李貨物，常遭其無故沒收。迨日軍投降後，楊逆即逃避他鄕，希圖逍遙法外。</p>
<p>乘車來滬漢奸落網</p>
<p>不料在本年十月初，楊逆正在崑山火車站搭車赴滬，恰爲被害之單幫商王蓮芳，王阿大等撞見，乃經王等跟踪至滬，下車後，即扭入憲兵隊，經該隊一度問訊後，即轉解高等檢察署偵查屬實，乃由該署依懲治漢奸條例第二條第八款，向高院提起公訴，昨晨十時即由高院推事劉　桂曹駿祝宗海檢察官林我朋開會議庭審訊，楊逆音先對所作所爲，百般狡賴，乃由庭論暫時還押，另傳告發人王蓮芳到庭，據王供稱：「吾向業單帮，當民國卅年時携帶西藥一箱，擬由滬乘車帶往金華銷售，不料爲楊查見，即告沒收，且因其時金華尚在國軍手中，敵憲兵即疑我與政府有關，即施酷刑，首先濯我冷水，繼即用皮鞭掀打，幸不久即告釋放，類此事件，每日必有數十起。</p>
<p>單幫少女時遭蹂躪</p>
<p>而楊逆最大罪惡　，即爲對跑單幫之弱女，如稍具姿色者，無一能逃其魔掌，楊昌基又名小楊，妻妾達十餘名之多，而旅客一聞其名，莫不懼如惡魔，我此次控告他，僅爲無數受害人伸寃而已」。庭上此時乃再傳楊昌基到庭，將原告所供事實，一一向其對質，然楊猶圖狡賴，僅稱王與彼向有私仇，彼並未充任敵憲佐，僅在三菱碼頭上任職監工，然庭上認爲案情已明，即由被告律師爲楊辯論後，經庭論本案定一月四日下午二時宣判。</p>

<h3>大西洋海底大戰的秘密</h3>
<p>— 李木</p>
<p>一九四二年，德國的潛水艇曾擊沉英美商船一千一百六十一艘。假如希特勒的潛艇武器能繼續這種破壞的效率，英國便早不能生存了，蘇聯也不會勝利了，而且遠東的對日戰爭與英美的運命，均將不堪設想。雙方都知道這是一件爭生死存亡的工作。美國因之才調了一百五十萬兵到大西洋上，並且還微用了數千位著名科學家，日夜研究如何抵制德國的奇秘利器。</p>
<p>聽覺魚雷</p>
<p>德國最初利用的海底秘密武器，是一種有聽覺的魚雷，這魚雷只消從潛水艇的放射器對敵船的方向射出之後，它就會尋着輪船推進器所發出來的聲音奔了去。這個『有聽覺的魚雷』，像獵犬嗅着兎子一樣，在水中穿行，只要聽到一點輪船推進器的細聲，就跟了聲音前行，直到觸着船身爆炸爲止。不論來船是如何轉彎，它轉得更巧，不論船走得多快，它跟得也更快。此外它還有一種可怕的本領，就是在一羣運輸船團中，它會尋最大的目標而加以破壞。在一隻小船行近一隻大船時，那魚雷立刻轉身向船身最大，聲音最響的船奔去。</p>
<p>吸音橡皮</p>
<p>英美海軍及科學家，對抗這種有聽覺魚雷，發明出一種發聲器，由此發聲器引導魚雷至另一發聲器，最後引到無船的地方。英美的雷達探音器發明以來，使德國人極感恐慌，因爲雷達利用海底的細微音波，觸到潛水艇的實體時，便有回音而得知潛艇所在地。德國人發明出一種橡皮，把潛水艇週身都包起，海底音波觸上時，便被橡皮吸住。德國終於研究出吸音橡皮，其功效是倘將屋內用這種橡皮封住，屋內兩人彼此對話，竟全不能聽見。隨後他們又發明一種膠質，把橡皮黏在潛艇身上。但這橡皮仍多少使音波有點回響。他們又發明一種海底的槍，放射出一種化學彈丸，可以發出聲音，擾亂音波。</p>
<p>狼羣戰略</p>
<p>德國的潛艇戰略，曾有三大改革，其中之一就是『狼羣戰略』。巡遊的潛艇都聚集在一處，等到它們的數目超過英美護送船團的軍艦時，才一齊衝擊。英美則用裝備雷達及炸彈的轟炸機羣破壞這種戰略。因爲潛水艇沉在海底廿四小時之後，必須浮出水面，將艇艙裏的燃料烟氣放出，它們露出水面便失掉威力。結果他們研究出一種柴油換風器，可使潛艇在海面四十呎下的速度增加一倍，因此使英美的飛機與雷達探音器全無效用。但德國人承認這種試驗成功遲了一年半。希特勒最後孤注一擲的派出六艘潛水艇要去攻擊美國的沿海岸，終爲英美的軍艦網與飛機羣幾經艱難苦鬥，全數擊沉。</p>
<p>德國最後一大潛艇戰略，是改良潛艇，使其深入海面下七百呎，而仍能保持每小時十五海里的驚人速度。可惜爲時已晚。有人間海于軍大將凱爾派屈克；英美在近三年內抵制潛水艇的方法如此進步，潛艇還有無效用。他回答道：『假如德國有機會再試，他們仍將試用潛水艇。』</p>

<h3>盲報販</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>前天早晨從河南路福州路轉角經過，看到一個瞎了雙眼的報販，一手拿　大堆報紙，一手扶着竹杖，立在人行道上喊賣各種日報。看樣子，不過二十多歲，倒是眉目清秀的靑年。</p>
<p>見了那盲報販，我不禁爲之惻然心動。我隨即向他買了幾份，注視他好久，想逗他談談。我的辦事處什麼報都有？我所以向他買，原來就含有一種憐憫他的心情。我問他：「在車馬橫衝直撞的街頭，眼睛看不見，爲何還要做報販？」他說：「沒有辦法，爲了生活，我不得不販幾份報賣賣。我的老家在大塲，戰爭毀滅了我的一切。我從小就瞎了眼，進過南京市立盲啞學校，一直讀到畢業。我很欣幸像我這樣的人還有機會接受敎育。」聽到南京市立盲啞學校這名字，我沈入淸晰的記憶：因爲我有一位曾受過盲啞專業敎學訓練的朋友葉炳華君，八一三則在那所學校担任過敎導主任，我在南京時也曾到那裏看過幾次，對於那學校的情形，知道得比較淸楚。我總續和他說：『晤，你是南京盲啞學校畢業的，那學校辦得很不錯，專鬥設備很充實，程度到相常完全小學。葉炳華先生你還記得他嗎？』一聽我提到葉先生的名字，他面部頓時呈現很親切而愉悅的樣子，他向我問他的近况，我約略告訴他一些。</p>
<p>對於面前的這盲報販。我覺得他的態度很誠懇，談吐很可愛。我接着問他的家世。他的話很深切地感動了我。我這時想到天下無數眼前不見一點光明的盲人，天賦的缺陷，奪去生命的光　，眞是可憐得很。他說他的眼睛雖然看不見一切的東西，然而心境到是很光亮的。『這八年中我的遭遇是再苦沒有了，母親死了，妻兒離散了，唯一賴以義活全家大小的阿哥，曾經供給我讀書費用的阿哥，在戰前做過鎭江師範附小敎員，戰爭發生後被日寇誣陷殺死，從此家破人亡，弄到現在這種地步。』從他蹙着的　頭，可以看出他內心的苦痛，終至嗚咽失聲，便斷了弦的胡琴，不能發出聲來。停了半晌，他又訴說他雖遭遇不幸，但對選擇　業，却仍堅持必須對敎育文化有所裨益，爲了維護民族的正義，發揚精神文化，終於選了賣報的職業。雖然這職業很苦，半天喊呌，還不能維持一人的生活。我找不出什麼話來安慰他，只說過這一句：『在多歧的人生旅途上，愼重你的脚步！』</p>
<p>街頭車馬奔馳，人聲喧關，不是可以長談的地方，我從人羣中擠過去，回首望着那遭遇悲苦的盲報販的背影，慢慢地在人　裏消失了。我想到那盲報販天賦的缺陷，剝奪了人生的幸福。又想到他雖是一個盲人，而幼年的境遇却並不怎樣壞，有慈母和阿哥溫暖他枯寂的心，後來又有　兒可以給他以安慰，然而現在一切完了，都成爲泡影了。更想到戰爭的殘酷，使他淪落街頭，向無盡的悲凉的世途流浪。孤獨，悲苦，惆悵，凄寂固然早已注定他的命運，但是我到覺得他的人格的光輝永遠令人感到他的心地是光明的，恐怕比有眼人還要光明—正義，智慧，把他的心照得亮亮的，沒有一些瑕疵。他並不像有些有眼人，被邪惡，利慾，謟媚，鄙吝種種毒熖所蒙蔽所遮掩。</p>
<p>司各德曾歌頌過盲人，說他們的心裏的光明代替了眼睛的光明。歷史上很多盲人憑了她們淸朗的心境，成功許多事業。歌唱着『像沙漠似寂寞』的心情的俄國女詩人愛羅先珂是一個肓人，然而她的詩篇的光輝，却永遠照耀於世界文壇，她的童話，在藝術的成就上也到了最高地步，她把一個無比的光明的世界，展開於我們面前。美國的海倫·克勒女士也是一個肓人，然而靠了她和她不幸際遇的堅毅的奮鬥，和繼續不斷的刻苦努力，她畢竟修完她的大學課程，奠定了她學術的基礎，後來終於成了偉大的社會事業家，予人類莫大貢獻。肓人的眼前雖然沒有光明，但他們到可以追求到光明的前途。</p>
<p>法國大文豪雨果，是浪漫主義的前軀，他在一篇小說裘，描寫一個盲樂師靠了他超人的音樂天才，從三弦琴上彈出他悽凉辛酸的境過，使人們深受感動。一個和他遭遇相同的建築師竟因他的藝術的『移情作用』，在衆人之前淸淚奪眶而出。莫泊桑也有一篇小說，寫一個盲女工籍淸脆婉囀的歌喉，傾動聽衆，在悽凉的生命旅程中，找到終身幸福的伴侶，主要的媒介就是一首歌。</p>
<p>我這次偶遇的那盲報販，他的內心蘊藏着很深的痛苦，他憑什麼向人們訴說呢？他不是前面所說的詩人，社會事業家，樂師，歌者，他的悲苦此那些盲藝人要深得多，因爲他不能把心情和衷曲發抒出來，他的痛苦永遠藏在心之深處，然而他對社會的貢獻却是很大，他不選擇其他一般盲人所　常做的職業，而在如虎口的馬路邊賣報。他自己不能直接接受精神文化的食糧，而却將這寶貴的食糧分配給人家去享受，這是何等崇高的職業！</p>
<p>聽說英國的『每日郵報』有專爲盲人而發行的凹凸版，肓人可以獲知每日的肚界大事，國家及社會新聞。聽了那肓報販的說話，覺得他確是一個富於正義感的靑年，他的求知欲很熾盛，然而誰滿足他呢？什麼時候他才有讀報的權利呢？</p>
<p>在歸途中，我想到這些問題，我禁不住要喊：『救救那盲報阪！救救盲人！」</p>

<h3>寗波五種螺</h3>
<p>— 嫉惡</p>
<p>寗波在淪陷時期，人民的痛苦，有非筆墨所能形容者。即以民衆所比擬的五種螺言之，可見一斑。</p>
<p>（一）香螺—按香螺原是一種海產，甬人用以佐餐，視爲佳餚，而民衆則以香螺諧音『鄉擄』，指　縣長，意思說　縣長假鄕鎭公所爲擄掠機構。</p>
<p>（二）田螺—田螺是各地農田中的產物，當時甬人以鄕鎭長旣是供應敵僞機關，又應酬遊擊部隊，政府機關，面面俱到之外，鄉鎮長本身亦腰纏累累，買田建屋，狂嫖豪賭。而鄕鎭長擄掠來源，出自田農，故認鄉鎭長爲田擄。</p>
<p>（三）辣螺—辣螺也是海產。當時僞軍步哨密佈，凡人民行經其地，無論是小本商版，或家常用品，皆須勒交稅款。他如僞警五步一崗，攔路勒索，絕不放　。人民因稱此輩爲勒（甬人『攔』與『勒』同音）擄。</p>
<p>（四）螄螺—蘇人稱螺，，甬人稱螄螺。其實是同一樣東西。當時遊雜部隊爲顧忌敵僞，因此向民間需索時，不敢明目張膽，祇好投函恫嚇，或秘密接洽，多以私了。所以寗波人對海雜部隊，稱爲『私擄』（螄螺）。</p>
<p>（五）泥螺—泥螺也是海產。昔年虞洽卿先生在宴會席上，非此下飯不歡。但當時寗波人所稱泥螺，則係指寇軍而言。因寇軍於每年秋收之時，下鄕　　食　，故稱之爲『年擄』（泥螺）。</p>

<h3>主席蒞平新聞片先睹記</h3>
<p>— 莫英</p>
<p>蔣主席蒞平經過，曾由中電攝成新聞片運滬。記者　先睹爲快，誠屬無任榮幸。該片將北平風光均收入鏡頭，描寫主席曁夫人抵平後一般民衆的狂　情况，歷歷如繪。主席對北平父老的訓話，語重心長，感人肺腑。收音淸晰，無異相聚一堂。主席參觀古物陳列所，室內光　雖欠佳，然鏡頭仍淸晣。能式　李宗仁諸將星均上鏡頭。最近所攝太和殿前對學生訓話的大塲面，尤爲雄壯偉大，到塲各校學生不下數十萬人，旗幟飛揚，行列整齊。主席勉靑年以鍛鍊身體，敦品力學，及奉行三民主義，對抗戰期間北平民衆所遭受的橫述壓迫，慰勉尤多。一時學生呼聲震天動地。華北靑年的集團興奮情景，是十數年來所未有。訓話畢，學生羣乃不約而同，羣爭奔集高台上，包圍主席的四週。主席是日輕車簡從，　然與靑年接近，記者得觀是片，熱情大爲衝動。該新聞片即將與上海觀衆見面了。</p>

<h3>重振國曆</h3>
<p>— 西園</p>
<p>中華民國已成立了三十四年，而立國最主要的『正朔』，就是改用陽歷，也就是正名定分的『國歷』，至今還沒有普遍實行。這在國體上以及國際上，是一件很大的恥辱。現在世界各國，英不採用陽歷，並且已有人主張陽歷還不適用，要改用其他新歷法。而我國從民國元年，早已正式頒布採用陽歷以來，在政府官廳方面，表面上施行陽歷，實際上一般國民，如敎育界，工商界，依然還用陰歷，不過在陽歷元且，放一天假罷了。這在鄕下農村，尚可原諒，還有一點理由可說，因爲他們要依着二十四個節氣來種田。但在都市上，表面採用，實際不用，所謂「陽奉陰違」，實在太不應該呀！</p>
<p>過去日寇佔領沿海各省，在上海南京，大提們陰歷。他們在虹口，興高釆烈過陽歷新年，任我們過陰歷新年，表示中國是落伍，是守舊，是「亡國現象」。所以每逢陰歷佳節，如『中秋，端午』等，他們也特別起勁，月餅粽子，在那八年中，價錢雖貴，而銷數反比往年多，一般人認爲理所當然，並有人認爲這是日寇的『仁政』。至於由華民國的立國正朔，早已拋在九霄雲外去了。</p>
<p>現在抗戰勝利，一切都要重振復興起來。我回想到民國二十四五年間，中央政府，嚴令各地實行國歷，廢除舊歷。陰歷元旦，學校要上課，工人要上工，商界不許停業，報紙不准停刋。當時雷厲風行，國民精神、上海風氣，爲之一振。當時且有新生活運動促進會，努力宜傳，推行國歷的標語，滿壁皆是。假使沒有對日抗戰的話，如今國歷也許早已普遍實行了。</p>
<p>現在民國三十四年度，已告結束了，一般國民，對於三十五年的元旦，似乎並不感到興味，好像還要等到陰歷新年，再來暢快一下，這實在是不應該的。我希望政府，以及新生活運動促進會，重申明令，一如二十四五年間的雷厲風行，再來一次正朔運動，這是作者所萬分希望的呀！</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3>雄心</h3>
<p>— 山民</p>
<p>就一般人說，都有雄心。不過雄心有大有小，有好有壞，有能實現有不能實現的區別。</p>
<p>雄心的大小，因各人的年齡和環境而不同。年齡小的，雄心大槪也小；環境良好的，雄心大槪也較大。這種例子不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>雄心的好壞，因性質而異。凡願爲大衆服務，必要時寗可犧牲自己的，都是好的雄心；反之，希望奴役和犧牲別人，以謀自己幸福的便是壞的雄心。從這裏面我們可以尋出一條雄心的好壞的分界綫來。</p>
<p>雄心的能否實現，第一要看這雄心是好是壞，第二要看這雄心有沒有實現的可能，第三要看個人的能力和決心的程度。凡好的，能實現的雄心，且具有能力和決心的話，是沒有不實現的。</p>
<p>我們應該具有雄心，使生命的力量能够表顯出來；不過這雄心一定要基於利人這方面；不然，不但葬送了自己，而且連累了別人。</p>

<p>— 西</p>
<p>主編先生：貴報於二十六日刋載關於臨大先修班甄審消息，這裏我有一些意見，請刋社會服務權，供臨業的學生，而臨大先修班只設文理二組，在輾轉失學的情形下，就無可如何的報大入了理組。雖然我深深地知道理組與我以前所讀的商科是不大相近的，商科的學科如薄記·會計·打字·珠算等項，均不會在甄審範圍以內，而理科的理·化·生物·解析幾何·大代數等等，我又始終未曾學過，這次的甄審無形的給予我一個很大的打擊。我希望臨大先修班當局，最好先將各學校予以審查一番，將現不存及不能認爲滿意的學校學生先予剔除，這樣一面可以减少「人滿爲患」的麻煩，一面可爲設野鷄學校者戒。第二步則將各學生高中肄業之學科如理·工·商等等予以分類，再行甄審，這雖是一件較煩的手續，倒是一個最最公約辦法。</p>

<h3>戒烟無憂論（四）</h3>
<p>— 胡起鵬</p>
<p>五　戒烟之方法與選擇</p>
<p>戒烟方法簡略分述如次</p>
<p>（一）遞減戒烟法—此法乃用數種麻醉藥品，逐漸遞減其量，以斷其烟癖，而免發生禁斷現象之痛苦。</p>
<p>（二）血淸戒烟法—此法即將吸烟者自身血液，每日抽出若干量，注入其肌肉，以抗烟毒，或用一種藥劑，敷於皮膚上，使其發泡，然後抽取泡內之血淸，再注入人體，即發泡戒烟法。但此法仍須與服適量麻醉品遞減之，但戒絕期間，可因血淸之注射而縮短。</p>
<p>（三）安眠戒烟法—此法用相當大量安眠藥，使受戒者在昏迷狀態中，不覺發　痛苦，約經三五日而達戒絕目的，此即所謂酩酊速戒法，但用之不愼，易起危險症象。</p>
<p>（四）藥物戒烟法—此法利用能緩解禁禁斷現象，或有抵抗烟毒之藥物，如阿刀便硫酸鎂有機性鈣溴素蛋黃素等等，以減少發癮之痛苦而達到斷癮之目的。</p>
<p>（五）精神戒烟法—不用藥物，憑其個人之決心，信仰之力量，或以迷信神道理敎之方法戒絕者，皆爲精神戒烟法，醫師對於就戒者，亦常施以精神暗示療法，以減少畏懼之心理。</p>
<p>綜上所述戒烟法，各有所長，亦各有其）短處，就余之經驗，須視戒烟者烟癮之深淺，身體之强弱，吸烟之原因，及經濟能力環境情形面定。但最爲妥善方法，是以遞減法爲主。並視身體之需要，投與適當滋補劑輔助之。蓋人體之細胞組織，對於烟毒已有日久不斷之供給，而養成不可或缺之習慣，今欲戒除此種習慣，亦非經相當時日不可，因此遞減戒烟法爲最合理也。惟對於因病吸烟成癮者，同時須注意其原有疾病，以免復發。（明日續完）</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference: Affirming the Leadership of the National Government to Establish a Unified and Democratic China; Reaffirming the Policy of Non-Interference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th dispatches] The Chinese government is expected to have received notification of the final communique of the Three Powers Foreign Ministers Conference and has likely expressed agreement with the various clauses listed in the communique. The resolutions of the Three Powers regarding Chinese affairs can be categorized as follows: (1) Affirming the necessity of the National Government in Chongqing to lead the establishment of a unified and democratic China. (2) Affirming the necessity of ending the Chinese civil strife. (3) Affirming the necessity of expanding the participation of democratic elements in the government. (4) The Allied nations must not interfere in China's internal affairs. [United Press, Moscow, 27th dispatches] The resolutions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference regarding China are as follows:</p>
<p>The three foreign ministers exchanged views on the situation in China. They agreed on the establishment of a unified and democratic China under the rule of the National Government and the cessation of civil war. They also reaffirmed their support for a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes held several talks on the issue of Soviet and American troops stationed in China. Mr. Molotov stated that the Soviet army had disarmed and disbanded the Japanese army in the Northeast, but at the request of the Chinese government, the Soviet army would postpone its withdrawal until February 1, 1946. Mr. Byrnes pointed out that the U.S. military was stationed in China at the request of the Chinese government and mentioned that the United States must fulfill its initial responsibility to implement the surrender terms, disarm and disband the Japanese army. Once the responsibility is discharged, or the Chinese government can assume the responsibility without the need for American assistance, the U.S. military will withdraw. The two foreign ministers agreed that the troops of both the Soviet Union and the United States should withdraw from China at the earliest possible time after completing their missions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 28th stated: Chinese Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen recently declared that the Chinese government has not yet received the full text of the declaration of the Three Powers Foreign Ministers Conference, therefore it is not convenient to announce its attitude.</p>
<p>Joint Control of Japan Was Originally Advocated by Our Country</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 28th dispatches] Chinese people here express welcome for the Three Powers Foreign Ministers Agreement, especially the agreement regarding China. They all hope that this agreement will safeguard China's sovereignty over the Northeast and promote China's peace and unity. Regarding the agreement on the early withdrawal of American and Soviet troops from China, its significance is twofold: first, the Soviet army was originally scheduled to complete its withdrawal from the Northeast on January 3, which is now bound to be delayed; second, the U.S. military will withdraw as soon as the disarmament and disbandment of the Japanese army is completed. Official sources stated that they will issue opinions after studying this agreement. A spokesperson said that China's inclusion in the United Nations Japan Control Committee is in line with China's wishes. As for the Korean issue, China has always advocated Korean independence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th Special Telegram] It is learned from authoritative sources that regarding the Allied nations' joint control of Japan, the Soviet Union initially proposed that a committee be formed by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to carry out the control work. The Far Eastern Advisory Commission advocated by the United States includes representatives of all countries directly engaged in war against Japan, but it is purely an advisory body without the power to directly implement or decide on policies. Before the Far Eastern Advisory Commission meeting in November, our government had drafted a compromise proposal. In addition to the aforementioned Advisory Commission, a Japanese Control Committee should be formed by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. This committee has the power to decide on policies for certain specific matters (such as the Japanese constitution and the Japanese government). However, the power to implement resolutions and command troops should still belong to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. This Chinese compromise proposal was generally agreed to by the United States. The scheme for the control of Japan agreed upon at the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference is largely China's proposal. Therefore, when the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union sought our agreement, we readily agreed.</p>
<h3>Control Committee for Japan: Does Not Change MacArthur's Command Authority; Still Holds Leading Position in Administrative Management</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 27th dispatches] The Three Powers Foreign Ministers Conference of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union concluded successfully today and issued a communique. Regarding the control of Japan, it was decided that the Far Eastern Commission would be organized by representatives of eleven United Nations countries, and the Japan Control Committee would be organized by the four countries of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and Britain. Once these two committees are established, the Supreme Commander of the United Nations in Japan, General MacArthur, will transfer most of his duties to the respective committees for handling. Any instructions issued by the Commander must be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission for review. The United States will be responsible for drafting various instructions based on the decisions of the committee, and instructions related to fundamental reforms in the organization or government of Japan must be consulted with the committee. Although MacArthur is subject to these restrictions, he still holds a leading position in the administration of Japan and will serve as chairman of the Four Powers Control Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th dispatches] The resolutions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference of Britain and the Soviet Union regarding Japan, in fact, do not change the authority of General MacArthur as the Commander of the United Nations. The mission of the Four Powers Control Committee for Japan is only to provide the commander with consultation and advice, and the United States is one of the four members, and MacArthur is the chairman of the committee. Although the Three Foreign Ministers Agreement increases the power of the Far Eastern Commission to formulate policies, it also stipulates a voting method that can prevent any decisions on Japan that are not approved by the United States. Therefore, the United States can prevent any attempt to change MacArthur's implementation of various instructions. The committee also guarantees respect for the existing Japanese control mechanism, including the command system from the U.S. government to the Supreme Commander's jurisdiction over the occupation forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th Associated Press] The main reaction to the two points announced by the Three Foreign Ministers Conference, the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Nations Committee on Japan, is that the Soviet Union has achieved complete success in its demand for equal joint management of Japan. Although there are veto provisions in the voting procedures of the Far Eastern Commission, the Soviet Union can still exert considerable power in the long-term policy towards Japan. Experts particularly pointed out that this agreement has restricted the U.S. government from issuing instructions to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, which should be in accordance with the policies decided by the Far Eastern Commission. Regarding the veto provisions, similar to those stipulated in the San Francisco Conference, there is a clause that "the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission can be implemented without unanimous agreement, but must at least be approved by a majority of representatives, and should include representatives from the four countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th dispatches] Regarding the resolution on the control of Japan, Washington believes that it is a major concession by the U.S. delegation. Right-wing figures are expected to point out that President Truman and Byrnes have repeatedly insisted that they will not allow the United States' final decisive say on the occupation of Japan to encounter interference. According to the decision of the Moscow Conference, General MacArthur, the Commander of the Allied Forces stationed in Japan, will have leading administrative responsibility, but he will be subject to policy controls, which will be decided by voting. Those who criticize it generally believe that the smoothly working occupation administration to date will be disrupted by the new method. It is heard that the occupation forces of Britain, China, and the Soviet Union will soon be sent to Japan, but their numbers are likely to be quite small, and the main burden of military occupation will still be borne by the United States.</p>

<h3>Divided Opinions in Korea on the Allied Trusteeship: Reluctant Acceptance vs. Opposition</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 27th Associated Press] Han Kil-mo, representing the Korean People's League, told the press that the Korean people reluctantly accept the decision of the Allied nations to establish a joint trusteeship over Korea for five years. The Korean people had hoped to meet the spirit of the Cairo Declaration and obtain a better solution so that Korea could achieve freedom and independence as soon as possible. However, for the sake of world peace and the political stability of Asia, we would rather have a glimmer of light than complete darkness and accept the agreement of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference with a spirit of compromise. We hope that the powers can immediately cancel the division of Korea into two and establish a provisional committee to prepare for the democratic government to be established by the Korean people.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 27th dispatches] A spokesperson for the unofficial Korean government led by Kim Koo today reiterated the demand for immediate independence and opposed the plan for a five-year joint trusteeship of Korea by the Allied nations.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminals Who Invaded China: Sakai Will Be Brought to Trial; Admits to Meeting with Communist Party Representatives Twice</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th dispatches] After the arrest of Sakai Takashi, a Japanese war criminal who invaded China, a reporter made a special visit to the spokesperson of the Army Headquarters. According to reports, Sakai Takashi served as the battalion commander of the Tianjin Garrison Army during the September 18th Incident. Later, he was transferred to be the chief of staff of the Tianjin Garrison Army of Meijiro Umezu. At that time, the various disturbances in Peiping and Tianjin were all instigated by him, such as the Hebei Incident in 1935, when the Japanese demanded that our troops and party headquarters withdraw from Hebei, as well as the subsequent instigation of the autonomy of the five provinces in North China, were all planned by Sakai. After the July 7th Resistance War, Sakai, with his qualifications as a "China expert," was promoted to commander of the North China Expeditionary Army. The crimes he committed in China are countless, but he had retired the year before last, so he was unknown in this surrender. However, Sakai has always regarded invading China as his way to advancement, so after his retirement, he repeatedly sneaked into China to engage in illegal activities. In early November, when Commander-in-Chief He patrolled Peiping, he learned that Sakai was carrying out a major conspiracy to disrupt North China, and immediately ordered an investigation and arrest. Because Sakai's whereabouts were secret, he could not be captured immediately. On November 29, Commander-in-Chief He also explained when hosting reporters in Chongqing that Sakai was colluding with the Chinese Communist Party and that the facts were being investigated. In order to whitewash their crimes, the Chinese Communist Party published an explicit telegram from Xinhua News Agency Yan'an on December 11, stating that Lieutenant General Sakai and Zhu did not participate in the Communist army's operations. On December 13, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily further falsely accused Commander-in-Chief He of having met with Sakai when he was in Peiping. This kind of behavior of deceiving compatriots is not worth refuting. In early December, Commander-in-Chief He re-issued the previous order, telegraphing Commander Sun Yingzhong of the Eleventh War Zone to quickly search and arrest him. At the same time, he telegraphed Takahashi, a Japanese liaison staff officer in North China, to come to Nanjing to inquire about the situation of Sakai's collusion with the Chinese Communist Party. Takahashi arrived in Nanjing on December 12 and admitted that Sakai had indeed been in constant contact with the Chinese Communist Party and revealed the address where Sakai Takashi was hiding. In mid-December, Commander Sun captured Sakai Takashi and sent personnel to escort him to Nanjing. After preliminary interrogation, Sakai directly admitted that he had attempted to disrupt North China. According to his confession, he had gone to the ancient temple in Wenquan Village, several kilometers west of Heilongtan, a suburb of Peiping, twice on September 7 and 11 to discuss cooperation with Zhang Xueshi, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party. However, because the Chinese Communist Party asked Sakai to find a way to make the Japanese army in North China refuse to surrender, the Japanese army in Peiping and Tianjin were afraid of violating the Potsdam Declaration and Chairman Chiang's orders, which would affect the future of Japan's entire national destiny, and did not dare to accept. At the same time, the National Army quickly arrived in Peiping and Tianjin by air, and Sakai's secret negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party could not be realized. However, Sakai did not give up and secretly lived in the western suburbs of Peiping, trying to revive his ambitions, but was eventually arrested and escorted to Nanjing by our army. He is currently detained in the Nanjing Garrison Command. Sakai is one of the war criminals and will be brought to trial together with other Japanese war criminals.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Hearing of Tianjin Traitors: To Be Sent to Court Immediately</h3>

He attended a banquet hosted by Mayor Xiong in the morning.

The economic, transportation, financial, and food aspects are all actively promoted with this purpose in mind. The receiving and handling of enemy and puppet properties is also extremely important. I hereby request that all military and political agencies in Peiping and Tianjin that are handling the receiving of enemy and puppet assets submit all schedules to me before 4:00 PM on December 30 for review and handling reports to the chairman.

<h3>Communist Party Proposes Ceasefire: Government Considering Response, Second KMT-CCP Talks Scheduled for Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A San Francisco broadcast on the 28th stated: The first day of negotiations between the Chinese Kuomintang and the Communist Party resulted in positive outcomes. Wu Guozhen, the Minister of Propaganda, announced that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is reviewing the Communist Party's "ceasefire" proposal. A response is expected within days, and the second KMT-CCP talks are scheduled to be held on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A San Francisco broadcast on the 28th stated: According to reliable sources, the Chinese Communist Party has presented the government with three major demands and eight additional demands. The content of the three major demands is as follows: (1) An immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities between both sides within China and Northeast China. (2) All military and political issues between the parties can be resolved after a complete ceasefire. (3) A mixed delegation composed of the KMT, the CCP, and neutral parties will be organized to inspect war zones. The content of the eight additional demands is as follows: (1) The Political Consultative Conference should convene on January 1st. (2) Immediate preparations should be made to convene this conference. (3) The Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference must be a non-government official. (4) Chen Jiageng, a wealthy Singaporean overseas Chinese, should participate in the Political Consultative Conference with a non-partisan status. (5) (Telegraph code unclear) (6) Complete freedom of the press. (7) Release of political prisoners (including Zhang Xueliang and Ye Ting). (8) (Broadcast interrupted, content unknown). It is reported that the Central Government does not object to the above demands.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] Propaganda Minister Wu Guozhen announced today that the government authorities have received the ceasefire proposal from the Communist Party and are currently considering a response. Wu stated that the Communist Party's sole reason for proposing a ceasefire is that they were defeated after attacking the Central Army and are now aware of the weakness of their military strength, "hence the sudden change in attitude." He also said, "The Communist Party previously believed they could defeat us, and this current change in attitude is the most gratifying sign of realizing reconciliation." Wu pointed out that the government proposed a ceasefire as early as October 31st. We regret that the Communist Party's proposal did not mention two important issues: the restoration of railway transportation and the repatriation of Japanese military and civilians. In the past four months, the Communist Army attacked GuiSui and Baotou in Suiyuan Province, Tengxian in Shandong Province, and Xiangyang in Hubei Province. The Communist Army was defeated everywhere and suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] President Chiang is today considering the Communist Party's written proposal for an unconditional ceasefire. It is expected that the government will formally respond when the KMT and CCP representatives meet tomorrow. However, according to a government spokesperson, any plan to freeze both sides in their current positions will prevent the execution of two major tasks: the restoration of transportation and the repatriation of Japanese troops and disbandment. The Communist Party's proposal is a response to the Central Government's proposal on November 30th, when the Central Government proposed a cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of the Communist Army 18 miles from the railway lines, which the Communist Party opposed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] Diplomatic circles revealed today that the KMT and CCP representatives began meeting here yesterday, and the atmosphere was "quite good". Special Envoy to China, Marshal Marshall, had a long discussion with Zhou Jingwen, a member of the Democratic League in Northeast China, regarding the Northeast issue.</p>

<h3>Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference Communiqué: Released in Moscow, Washington, and London, Global Situation Now More Clear</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] Following the conclusion of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, a 5,000-word communiqué was released simultaneously in London, Washington, and Moscow yesterday. The communiqué resolved to establish a United Nations commission to control atomic energy, reorganize the current system for controlling Japan, establish a Far Eastern Commission to replace the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, and establish a committee of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union to control Japan, among other matters. The communiqué also announced the detailed steps for the formal recognition of the Romanian and Bulgarian governments by Britain and the United States and resolved to make Korea an independent nation. The communiqué is divided into eight parts, the final part dealing with the control of atomic energy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 28th] In the communiqué of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union suggested forming an atomic energy management committee to ensure that atomic energy is used for peaceful purposes. Byrnes, Bevin, and Molotov agreed on the conditions for the recognition of the governments of Romania and Bulgaria by Britain and the United States and prepared to conclude peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland. Regarding the United Nations General Assembly, the three foreign ministers suggested that the United Nations General Assembly convene in January to decide on the organization of the Atomic Energy Management Committee by the United Nations Security Council, and France and Canada have been invited to support this resolution.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin will depart for home via Berlin after a farewell talk with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today. It is believed here that Marshal Stalin's presence in Moscow and the Soviet representatives' more conciliatory attitude were important factors. When Stalin received Bevin and Byrnes, he revealed extremely realistic, balanced, and hopeful views. British and American representatives said today that although much remains to be done, the conference was a very helpful starting point. The global situation is now clearly becoming clearer than before. Byrnes had previously suggested that the next Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference might be held in Washington next March. The discussion of atomic energy control was more important than other topics. The exchange of views on this matter among the three parties was exceptionally frank and friendly but did not involve technical details. Bevin and Byrnes had informed Canada in advance of the positions they adopted. Canada will be invited to participate in the agreement on the control of atomic energy. During the discussion of future weapons, the three foreign ministers and their advisors talked about cosmic-ray-guided bombs, radar-controlled bombs, and other new weapons. The British and American representatives believed that Soviet interests in Eastern Europe had been adequately recognized, and the American representatives further believed that the agreement on Eastern Europe had satisfied more than half of the Soviet Union's ambitions.</p>
<p>Committee Established: Joint Control of Atomic Energy</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] Regarding the issue of atomic energy control, the communiqué of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference stated: The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom agreed to invite China and France, members of the Security Council, as well as Canada, to jointly preside over the first meeting of the United Nations organization's General Assembly to propose the establishment of an Atomic Energy Control Commission. The Commission should rapidly investigate all stages of the atomic energy problem and should make recommendations as soon as possible. The Commission should especially make special recommendations on the following items: (1) Expanded exchange of peaceful scientific information by all countries; (2) Expanded control of atomic energy to ensure that it is only used for peaceful purposes; (3) National disarmament should eliminate atomic weapons and other weapons with group destructive capabilities; (4) Preventing accidental violations or evasions by member states through inspection and other methods. The Commission's work should be carried out in several stages. The next stage of work should not begin until the previous stage has been completed. The Commission should not infringe on the powers of any organization of the United Nations, but should submit recommendations to these organizations for consideration in accordance with the United Nations Charter. The Commission shall be composed of one representative from each member of the Security Council, together with one representative from Canada (if Canada has not been elected as a member of the Security Council).

In the case of Romania, a committee composed of the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and the American and British ambassadors to the Soviet Union should go to Romania to inspect and determine whether the country's government has been expanded and whether free and unhindered elections can be held as soon as possible.

The communiqué also reiterated the communiqué on the peace treaty procedures for the German satellite states, which was released by Moscow Radio on December 24th. The communiqué stated that the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference from December 16th to December 26th was held in accordance with the subsequent resolutions of the Crimea Conference and supplemented the Potsdam Conference with affirmation, because the prior resolutions stipulated that the participating countries should exchange views on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>General Reaction After the Communiqué: Belief that the United States and Britain Have Made Concessions, Stalemate Broken, Differences Resolved</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Regarding the communiqué released after the conclusion of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, the general reaction is that the stalemate caused by the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in September has now been broken, and there is a possibility that other differences have also been resolved. The New York Herald Tribune stated: This communiqué requires one to acknowledge the ability of the three foreign ministers to take responsibility and make decisions. The communiqué itself is a very promising sign. According to a telegram from our correspondent Hard Kesel, responsible individuals in Washington believe that the stalemate has been broken. However, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, who departed from Moscow yesterday on his way back to the United States, is expected to encounter fierce criticism from the right-wing opposition because he has "retreated" from the position he adopted at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. American officials do not conceal their view that Byrnes has made "significant concessions," and British Foreign Secretary Bevin has also made smaller concessions.</p>
<h3>Balkan Stalemate: Completely Broken, Washington Expresses Gratification</h3>

<h3>Opinions of American Congressmen</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] American congressmen vigorously supported the Three-Power plan to manage atomic weapons, but sharply criticized the United States' agreement to grant the Soviet Union veto power in the expanded control of Japan policy. Senator Wiley expressed his fear, saying, "This subsequent resolution will weaken MacArthur's power and make his task more difficult. We do not understand why we must grant the Soviet Union veto power over MacArthur's power. Japan was defeated by us, and we have no reason to make concessions to anyone." Other congressmen expressed excitement about the ability of the Three-Power Conference to establish an agreement on issues such as controlling Japan and managing atomic bombs. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom said, "This is a step that should be taken, and the more we can cooperate and agree, the better the chances for world peace."</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission: En Route to Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hamilton Field, California, 27th] Forty representatives of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, traveling on two transport planes from Washington to Japan, were forced to land here due to inclement weather.

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Special Dispatch] It is learned that after the representatives of the Far Eastern Advisory Commission arrive in Japan, they will carefully study how MacArthur is implementing the instructions of the American authorities. Most representatives believe that MacArthur has done a good job in accordance with the instructions of the authorities. In the past two months, the commission has paid the most attention to studying the instructions themselves. Although most representatives unanimously agreed that the instructions of the American authorities were sound, they believed that some parts of the instructions should be further clarified, especially the original instructions issued by the White House to MacArthur shortly after Japan surrendered. Regarding this point, the Advisory Commission established a Basic Policy Subcommittee, chaired by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, to be responsible for revising and clarifying the basic documents. The revised documents are currently being sent to the relevant governments for consideration. If approved and agreed upon by the United States, the new basic instructions will be sent to MacArthur for compliance.</p>

<h3>Indian Constitutional Committee Proposes Establishment of an Indian Federation, Opposes Division and Domination, Lawrence to Give Broadcast on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>[United Press New Delhi, 27th] The Indian Constitutional Reform Committee today submitted its final report, advocating the establishment of an Indian Federation, including all of British India and the Indian states. It also stated that demands for division or non-accession were unacceptable, as they would leave the states and provinces outside the Federation. Division would betray the essence of the constitution and constitute an unconstitutional act. Therefore, the committee proposed removing the provision in the 1942 Cripps proposal that allowed states and provinces to choose not to join. The report concluded that Indian Muslims are not a separate nation isolated from other societies, and therefore the demands of the All-India Muslim League are not sufficient to resolve various common problems, but rather would create new ones. Considering only national defense, dividing a country into two independent states would endanger each other's security and make them more susceptible to foreign domination. Therefore, the committee firmly believes that a democratic constitution is most suitable for India, and that a representative government is also suitable, even in a joint legislative and executive body.</p>

<h3>With Marshal Ma: A Joint Performance of the Ba Mountain Rain Song - A Quick Sketch of His First Press Conference After Arriving in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Our national guest, Marshal Marshall, amidst the unanimous and enthusiastic anticipation of Chinese and foreign individuals, has traveled from Leesburg Village in Foosini, to Washington, to Shanghai, to Nanjing, and then, on the 22nd, flew to Chongqing. Details have been reported by our newspaper's special correspondent. Two days after Marshal Ma's arrival in Chongqing (the 24th), he held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists. No less than sixty reporters attended, chatting and laughing, creating an extremely harmonious and lively atmosphere throughout the venue. This poetic and lush report below is expected to be closely watched by readers. (Editor)</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall resides in the temporary official residence of Yi Yuan in Chongqing. Yi Yuan was originally the private residence of Dean Song. Many American dignitaries who have written their great achievements in the history of Sino-American friendship, such as Curie, Willkie, Willson, and Hurley, have successively resided there.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, Marshal Marshall held his first press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists after arriving in Chongqing. The appointed time was 9:45 AM. Around 8:50 AM, reporters had already braved the cold rain and arrived at the American Embassy on Liangfu Zhi Road.</p>
<p>At 9:40 AM, Marshal Marshall arrived, still wearing the same clothes he had on when he got off the plane that day. He first walked with his entourage across the open space in front of the embassy office to overlook the Jialing River shrouded in misty rain. The reporters waited for him in the corridor. Three minutes later, he and his entourage came over, took off their coats outside the door, and greeted the reporters in English as they entered: "Good morning!" He walked through the aisle cleared by the reporters and into another room.</p>
<p>Following that, an embassy staff member invited the reporters to enter. It was a not-so-large room facing the sun, packed with more than sixty Chinese and foreign reporters.</p>
<p>A Magnificent Picture</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall leaned against the fireplace, the flames in the fireplace were blazing, and on the wall above the fireplace hung a large map of the Pacific Theater of War. The reporters saw even more clearly today this marshal who was decisive in the battles across the two oceans. His neatly combed hair was completely silver-white, but his complexion remained radiant and youthful. The three rows of medals on his chest and the white five-star marshal's shoulder boards all recorded his glorious achievements from World War I to the victory of World War II. On the little finger of the marshal's left hand, he wore a gold-set gemstone ring. The red flames, the large war map, the marshal's white hair, imposing presence, medals, and gemstone ring... all constituted an incomparably magnificent picture.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen!" Robinson, the Chargé d'Affaires of the American Embassy, spoke first. After a brief introduction to the reporters, he invited the Marshal to speak.</p>
<p>Two Strong Legs, Good at Kicking Demons</p>
<p>The fire in the fireplace was burning very brightly. Before Marshal Marshall was about to speak, a lump of red-hot burning coke rolled out of the fireplace. The Marshal kicked it back in with his leather shoe. Marshal Ma was a famous soccer player in his early years. Today, in this small room, the reporters saw his unconscious performance. At the same time, this is a ready-made metaphor: telling the world's fire players that Marshal Marshall's strong legs are always waiting to kick you into the furnace.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen!" Marshal Marshall said, "I am very happy to meet you here today! Thank you all for coming in such large numbers. It is a pity that this room is too small. Regarding the United States' policy toward China, President Truman has made a statement that you all already know. I don't want to say anything more about it today. I cannot answer any of your questions now, because I know very little about China and have only recently started learning about many things about China."</p>
<p>China and the United States Care About Each Other</p>
<p>He continued, "However, during this war, I am very clear about the United States' material, trade, and military assistance to China. I have been to the area of Beiping, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan in North China before. This is my first time in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Chongqing. I miss China very much, and the government and people of the United States also miss China. I believe that the government and people of China also miss the United States." Marshal Marshall spoke in a slow and sincere tone, "Now, I would like to hear what questions you have."</p>
<p>"How long will the Marshal stay in Chongqing?" a Chinese reporter asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know yet."</p>
<p>Whether to Go to Yan'an is Still Under Consideration</p>
<p>"Will you go to Yan'an?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"I have not considered this matter yet."</p>
<p>"When can the American troops stationed in China withdraw?"</p>
<p>"Don't know yet!"</p>
<p>After many unanswerable questions, this question made Marshal Marshall and the journalists burst into laughter together.</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall said, "I can answer this one. I am invited to lunch by Chairman Chiang and his wife at noon, and this afternoon I will attend a cocktail party at the American Embassy."</p>
<p>The questions ended there. Marshal Marshall greeted Chargé d'Affaires Robinson, who was standing next to the desk, and walked out of the reception room. The reporters followed him out.</p>
<p>Browsing Chinese Newspapers with Great Interest</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall stood at the door, shaking hands with the reporters one by one and asking each person which newspaper they represented. The reporters thanked him one by one. At this time, the reporter specially presented him with two copies of the newspaper, which the Marshal browsed and looked at with great interest.</p>
<p>In front of the embassy office building, Marshal Marshall and the reporters took a group photo, ending the press conference. From 12:15 PM on the 22nd to now, Marshal Marshall has been in Chongqing for a full two and a half days. His impression on the Chinese and American people in Chongqing is extremely profound.</p>
<p>More Revelry on Top of Revelry</p>
<p>As the reporter writes this dispatch, it is the first Christmas after the victory. Outside the window, the poetic "Ba Mountain Night Rain" is falling. Let us let this guest from across the Pacific Ocean personally taste this lush poetry! This year's Christmas Eve in Chongqing, in the common memory of the Chinese and American people, is a layer of revelry added on top of revelry.</p>
<p>(Christmas Eve, 12:00 AM, Zhao Haosheng, sent from Chongqing.)</p>
<h3>Statistics on Losses in Soviet Agriculture</h3>
<p>The figures of the losses inflicted by the German occupiers on Soviet agriculture are truly appalling. According to written evidence, the Special Committee for Investigating the Atrocities of the National German Fascist Aggressors estimates that the losses of collective farms alone amounted to 181,000,000,000 rubles. In addition, the losses of machinery and tractor stations amounted to tens of billions of rubles.</p>
<p>The German fascist aggressors destroyed the collective and state-owned farms, machinery, and tractor stations in the Soviet territories they occupied, according to a pre-determined plan. The German army destroyed, seized, or transported back to the country from Soviet collective farms and state-owned farm machinery and tractor stations 137,000 tractors, 40,000 combine harvesters, approximately 4 million cultivating tools, 265,000 seeders, and 885,000 harvesting machines.</p>
<p>The German army destroyed almost all of the agronomic laboratories of the collective farms. The aggressors also inflicted huge losses on livestock breeding. They killed or transported back to their country 7 million horses, 17 million cattle, and tens of millions of sheep. (Translated by US News)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Achievements of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference concluded in the Soviet capital on the 27th, lasting twelve days since its opening on the 15th of this month. The conference was convened because all parties, in light of the failure of the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in October, the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, and the difficulties regarding the control of atomic energy, although holding fervent hopes, initially did not dare to have overly optimistic expectations. However, over these twelve days, the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference proceeded in an atmosphere of harmony and coordination, and ultimately reached several important agreements, which is truly a comforting thing.</p>
<p>According to the communique of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which was released simultaneously in Moscow, Washington, and London on the 28th, the conference reached the following important agreements: (1) Establishing the Far Eastern Commission to replace the existing Far Eastern Advisory Commission, and establishing a four-nation committee of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States to control Japan; (2) The US and Soviet troops should withdraw from China within the shortest possible time after completing their missions in China; (3) Supporting the Chongqing National Government to implement democratic politics; (4) Establishing an Atomic Energy Management Committee to ensure its application to peaceful goals; (5) Regarding the Korean situation, the US and Soviet military headquarters will conduct consultations within two weeks to organize a joint committee to assist in the establishment of a Korean provisional government; (6) Britain and the United States recognize the conditions of Romania and Bulgaria, etc. In addition to these, some issues may have been raised for discussion, but their absence from the announced results does not mean that there are other secret agreements; it seems to only have been an exchange of views without reaching any agreement. However, even in terms of the announced results, the richness of the gains of this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has truly exceeded general expectations. This is another clear demonstration of the three powers' wholehearted cooperation in handling the world situation; we sincerely hope that this spirit of harmonious and coordinated cooperation can continue to be promoted and developed.</p>
<p>However, after reading the announcement of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, we cannot help but feel many emotions. The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has agreements regarding China, but our country has no representative to participate in it. We do not deny that the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference's agreements on China are quite wise; what we regret is that China's international status has improved after a long war of resistance, but there are still people in the country who do not value national interests and engage in internal struggles, so that the situation in China is also included in the agenda of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Anyone with sincerity should feel ashamed of this. Now that the three powers have insight into the situation in our country and have unanimously agreed to support the National Government in implementing democratic politics, conspirators who plot to undermine China's unity and those ambitious people who attempt to overthrow the National Government should restrain themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of joint control of Japan, we have pointed out that this issue is not a disagreement in principle, but a difficulty in execution. The defeat of the Japanese invaders was due in no small part to the strength of the American military, but China, the Soviet Union, and the United States have all made contributions. Among them, China has resisted Japanese aggression for the longest time and made the greatest sacrifices. In principle, we strongly agree with the joint control of Japan, but the so-called joint control may have various different interpretations. MacArthur in Tokyo is acting as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, not as the Supreme Commander of the US Forces, in performing his duties, so MacArthur himself already represents joint control. The joint control of Germany is divided into zones of governance by Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Although there is a joint control committee, in practice, it is practically a hollow shell. This is an example of the Allied powers' joint control of defeated Germany. It is said that the Soviet military has requested to send troops to occupy Hokkaido, but MacArthur only agreed to send troops to Kyushu. Whether the so-called joint control of Japan will follow the precedent of joint control of defeated Germany is also an issue of implementation. Furthermore, China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union may each send troops to Japan, without dividing the occupation zones of each country, and jointly control the entire Japan as the object. All of these are different interpretations that the joint control of Japan may cause. We believe that since MacArthur has entered Japan in the name of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, the major Allied powers that fought against Japan should strengthen MacArthur's power with this as the center, and should not repeat the mistakes of joint control of Germany and implement a policy of zonal occupation. The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference's agreement on the joint control of Japan can be said to be a good step forward in this direction.</p>
<p>Regarding the independence of Korea, the Cairo Conference already had a clear announcement. Now that the war has been won, the promises of the Cairo Conference should naturally be put into practice. The recent situation in Korea seems quite disappointing. The existence of the US and Soviet military occupation zones has left Korea in a split. The 38th parallel is a very painful wound for the Korean people. This unnatural division, although perhaps an inevitable result in military terms, is a hidden concern for the survival of the Korean nation. The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference's agreement on Korea, while taking care of the facts, does not forget the spirit proclaimed by the Cairo Conference, which is a great achievement. The only urgent task of the joint committee at present is how to connect the US and Soviet military occupation zones, so that this artificial barrier can be eliminated; then Korea can embark on the road to democracy and independence.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of atomic energy, it is also very gratifying that this Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference was able to reach an agreement. In the past, the three powers seemed to have quite different views on the issue of atomic energy. In fact, the core of the issue is not in keeping or disclosing the secret of the use of atomic energy, but in how to control the use of atomic energy. From a long-term perspective, it is impossible to keep the secret of the use of atomic energy; therefore, asking for the disclosure of the secret of the use of atomic energy seems to be meddling. The problem is control. Now that the British-Soviet Conference has agreed to organize an international committee to deal with issues regarding the use of atomic energy, it is believed that effective control will be obtained.</p>
<p>The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has been changed into a "Three-Power Dictatorship Conference." Although this is close to slander, from a realistic point of view, the convening of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference can exchange opinions with each other and reach agreements on some major issues, which is of great benefit to the stability of the international situation. It is regrettable that when the interests of China and France were involved, although the two countries maintained close contact with Moscow, they ultimately failed to actively participate in expressing their views. The reconstruction of the world order requires the concerted efforts of the United Nations. This Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has established a good standard for international cooperation, and may that spirit be maintained for a long time. The world's future and the happiness of mankind depend on it.</p>

<h3>Price Controls on US Cotton Fabrics Will Not Be Abolished for the Time Being</h3>
<p>(Reuters, New York, 28th) It is reported that there is no hope of abolishing price controls on cotton fabrics before June 1946.

It is estimated that it will take about half a month for factories to clear their 1945 orders one by one.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Remain Healthy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market remained stable. Scattered households from Hong Kong and Guangdong continued to absorb 20-count special Double Horse yarn, rising by another 20,000. Sales from other merchant groups were sluggish. However, local cloth factories continued to have a healthy appetite for fine yarn. Each brand of 32-count and above rose by another 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The price of 20-count and 16-count yarn rose by about 10,000 yuan.

<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice See Further Declines</h3>

The price fell by several tens to 100 yuan compared to yesterday. Soybean retail sales were very active, and the price rose by 200 to 300 yuan. The oil market was inquired about by the Ningbo gang, and sales were still active, with the price rising by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were thin downstream, and the price fell by 100 to 200 yuan.

<h3>North-South Goods Sales Are Moving, Overseas Market is Strong</h3>

<h3>The Market Price of Coal Briquettes Continues to Rise, Firewood and Charcoal Are Also Gradually Seeing a Turnaround</h3>
<p>White coal briquettes continue to sell well. The inventory of the same industry is thin. The goods owners see an opportunity to adjust the price, and the market price continues to rise. The prices of bituminous coal are stable and constant, and the prices lack glory and disgrace. The number of boats arriving from overseas with firewood and charcoal has suddenly decreased due to the weather and wind direction, etc., and only a few river boats are still transporting them to Shanghai, so the market is gradually seeing a turnaround, and the market is gradually becoming firm.</p>
<h3>Building Materials Sell Well, Shipments Are Many - Market is Stable</h3>
<p>Building materials such as cement, asphalt, roofing felt, and asphalt paper are selling very well, because there are government agencies purchasing them, and various factory owners who are repairing their factories are also purchasing them.

<h3>Hong Kong British Merchants Resume Business: Accept Three-Month Orders; Prefer British Exchange Over US Exchange</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Dispatch] Hong Kong's business is indeed thriving. Various foreign firms are preparing to resume operations, and some have already begun accepting orders for goods with a three-month delivery period, indicating that goods will arrive in three months. The orders mainly consist of building materials, timber, copper, iron, textiles, automobiles, and daily necessities. Although merchants generally tend towards business, British exchange is preferred over US exchange for purchasing foreign exchange, resulting in British merchants receiving more orders. This is because the Hong Kong government, in order to support British merchants, allows direct application to banks for British pound exchange with proof of importing goods from the sterling area, while applications for US dollar exchange must first be submitted to the authorities for approval, which is somewhat restrictive. However, competition from American merchants is very active, and it is reported that the US government will send a commercial specialist to Hong Kong to plan everything. The four major companies in Hong Kong have sent representative Huang Yongshan to Australia to purchase goods on behalf of the four companies.</p>
<h3>Future of Liverpool Cotton Market: Decision Expected by Year-End</h3>

Sir Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade, stated in the House of Commons on October 15th that a tripartite joint organization had been established for cotton and other industries, consisting of representatives of employers, workers, and impartial individuals, so that British industry could compete in the world market and supply domestic consumption with affordable and high-quality goods. At a press conference on the same day, Cripps also stated that the government had firmly decided not to nationalize industries that established such organizations, but that the organizations could make any recommendations other than nationalization.</p>

<h3>Relief for Educational and Cultural Undertakings: First Batch of Books Arrives in Tingjiang; Educational Institutions May Apply to the Ministry of Education for Distribution</h3>
<p>[Local Dispatch] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) originally stipulated that relief supplies were limited to clothing, food, shelter, and the livelihood of the people, and did not include relief for educational and cultural undertakings within UNRRA's scope.

<h3>Expert in Geography and Cartography, Su Jiabing, Passes Away</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Dispatch] Su Jiabing, an expert in geography and cartography, passed away in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 27th). Mr. Su graduated from National Peking University. He created the "Historical Map of Chinese Geography" and researched geography and cartography.

When the August 13th Incident occurred, he was unable to move inland and lived in seclusion in Shanghai. Although he was under the oppression of the enemy, he still worked day and night, providing the people of China with maps of the Northeast provinces that did not change color. Last summer, he was arrested by the Japanese gendarmerie and imprisoned for nearly a month. He was subjected to torture and enticement, but he remained unyielding. After Mr. Su was released from prison, the internal damage was already deep. He was sent to the Red Cross Hospital by his family for treatment, where he was hospitalized for half a year. Recently, with the victory achieved, Mr. Su was mentally excited and seemed to be recovering. However, due to excessive internal injuries, he passed away on the 27th of this month.</p>

The contents include educational essays, educational news, school features, and association reports. The inaugural issue will be published at the beginning of next month. Schools with news can immediately send it to the Editorial Department of the Educational Newsletter of the Municipal Educational Association at 735 Zhongzheng Middle Road.</p>
<p>There are many alumni of Fudan University serving in various fields at home and abroad, including quite a few in Ningbo. There has always been an alumni association, but since the April 19th Incident, the alumni have dispersed and the association's affairs have been suspended. Now, with the victory of the War of Resistance, most of the alumni have returned to Ningbo. Zheng Baohua and others have initiated preparations to restore the alumni association and reorganize its affairs. It is reported that a meeting has been scheduled for the 30th of this month at Zhengshi Middle School to discuss all matters of procedure.</p>
<p>The Municipal Honglu Primary School has reopened at its original address at 349 Hongqiao Road, Xujiahui. A large portion of the school buildings is still occupied by the No. 8 Health Station of the Municipal Health Bureau. It is reported that the station has already found a site at 250 Hongqiao Road. The continued occupation of the school buildings has drawn much criticism.</p>
<p>At the request of its members, the Shanghai Primary School Teachers' Joint Improvement Association recently convened a discussion on livelihood issues. Representatives from over three hundred schools attended. Statistics showed that the highest salary was 8,000 legal currency units, and the lowest was 200. The discussion was heated, and finally three improvement measures were proposed: (1) The school's finances should be made public and expenditures should be rationalized, (2) The school board should be responsible for supplementing funds, and (3) Salaries should be the same as those of municipal school teachers. For temporary relief, it was requested that the Director of Education initiate a Respect Teachers Movement. It is reported that the Association has already submitted a request to the Education Bureau for implementation.</p>
<p>Ying Yongyu, Huo Mingjie, Tang Zhidi, Zhou Songkang, and others, graduates of the Department of Commerce of Shanghai Law School, will hold a joint banquet on New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic to celebrate the school's relocation from Tunxi to Shanghai and to welcome Acting President Chu Hanlai for his hard work for the country and the school.

<h3>Chengyou Cup Group A Yesterday: Shan Team Defeats Donghua by a Large Margin</h3>
<p>Green Forest Suffers a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>Desheng Triumphs</p>
<p>Yesterday, the weather suddenly turned cold, and the basketball court was not very crowded, perhaps due to the sudden price increase by the authorities. In the two matches, the first match between Desheng and Green Forest was relatively close. The second match between the Shan team and Donghua went by in a one-sided situation. As a result, Green Forest suffered a crushing defeat to Desheng with a score of 22 to 26. In the second match between the Shan team and Donghua, the score was 48 to 31, with the Shan team defeating Donghua by a large margin.</p>
<h3>Central Agricultural Experiment Station</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiaer</p>
<p>The Qingbei Highway is a branch of the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway. Going north from Qingmuguan along the Qingbei Highway, four kilometers from Beibei, there is a small market called Tianshengqiao, which is also a station on the Qingbei Highway. If you jump off the bus here, what unfolds before your eyes is a vast and beautiful farm—the Central Agricultural Experiment Station.</p>
<p>In May of last year, former US Vice President Wallace visited Beibei. Instead of visiting the famous scenic Beibei Hot Springs, he made a special trip to visit this place. He praised it greatly and promised to do his best to assist after returning to the United States to facilitate connections and promote development.</p>
<p>The Central Agricultural Experiment Station is not just a simple farm, but also an academic research institution. It is located at the foot of Jinyun Mountain and experiments with the planting of rice, wheat, beans, cotton, melons, fruits, and vegetables. It conducts research on soil, fertilizers, diseases, and variety improvement, and has achieved great results. In recent years, it has not only made many inventions in agricultural affairs, but also, because of the good harvests, influenced the farmers in the nearby area to automatically improve their agriculture. This is most commendable. The tomatoes they harvest are as big as ordinary vegetable bowls, with a lovely red color. They are also experimenting with improving a type of mandarin orange produced near Beibei, striving to make its color, fragrance, and taste comparable to the Sunkist produced in the United States.</p>
<p>The staff work both mentally and physically, using both their brains and their hands. Sometimes they observe pests under a microscope, and sometimes they cultivate bacteria in a greenhouse. They use pens to depict the morphology of pests and bacteria, recording their changes. They also draw curves on forms, recording everything they have researched. Sometimes they also work in the fields with hoes and plows, improving agricultural tools for application and increasing work efficiency.</p>
<p>This is truly a new world. If more of these academicized farms were established in the country, agriculture would definitely make great progress, and there would be no need to worry about heavy industry lacking a foundation in the nation-building stage.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Meeting Discusses: Construction of Public Housing; Widening of West Nanjing Road; Establishment of Shanghai Relief Home</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government held its 14th Municipal Government Meeting at 9:30 AM on the 28th. Mayor Qian Dajun, Deputy Mayor He Dekui, Secretary-General Shen Shihua, and bureau chiefs, directors, and advisors attended. Mayor Qian chaired the meeting. The following matters were discussed:</p>
<p>Key Resolutions</p>
<p>(1) The draft organizational regulations of the Shanghai Relief Home, jointly prepared by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau, was discussed. Approved according to the review opinions. (2) The draft organizational regulations of the Shanghai Health Bureau's Health Experiment Institute, the Shanghai Health Bureau's Drug and Food Inspection Institute, and the Shanghai Drug Supply Office, submitted by the Health Bureau, were discussed. Approved with amendments. (3) The Public Works Bureau's proposal to construct public housing to alleviate the housing problem for some of the poor was discussed. Approved in principle, and: 1. Request the Chairman to instruct the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate materials; 2. Request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to allocate funds from the proceeds of selling enemy and puppet properties; 3. Repair funds will be allocated immediately by the Municipal Government; 4. The Public Works Bureau will begin work on this project. (4) The Civil Affairs Department's draft organizational rules for the Shanghai urban area's Baojia Reorganization Committee and the Shanghai urban area's temporary Baojia organizational measures were discussed. Approved with amendments. (5) The Public Works Bureau proposed: The temporary measures for restricting the issuance of construction permits have expired, but the city's overall urban plan is difficult to complete in the short term, and the road systems of each district cannot be stipulated and announced in time. Should the restrictions be extended? Approved. (6) The Public Works Bureau proposed: To widen the section of West Nanjing Road along the north side of the racecourse first to facilitate traffic. Approved.</p>
<p>Public Housing</p>
<p>During the city's occupation, the number of houses destroyed was countless, leading to ordinary people erecting simple shacks on vacant land for shelter. However, the materials used were mostly bamboo, wood, reed mats, etc., and they were built privately, making them very prone to fire and endangering lives. Hygiene was also often neglected. Therefore, temporary measures for banning private shack construction and temporary measures for shack construction were enacted to gradually ban them. In particular, those built on sewers, obstructing dredging work, were even more urgent. However, if they are demolished without appropriate relief measures, it would inevitably lead to displacement and neglect of the basic needs of the people. Therefore, yesterday's municipal government meeting decided on a public housing construction plan within the city, which will be carried out in three steps: (1) Add public housing villages, 1,000 units of Grade A and 2,000 units of Grade B, for a total of 3,000 units, with each unit limited to one household. (2) Restore the destroyed public housing villages on Qimei Road, Zhongshan Road, Pushan Road, and Xietu Road, rebuilding on the original sites, with 194 units of Grade A and 316 units of Grade B. In addition, existing public housing villages in the above locations will be repaired.</p>
<p>Relief Facilities</p>
<p>The main points of the organization of the Municipal Relief Home are as follows: The organizational rules of the Relief Home stipulate that the internal structure includes a director and a deputy director, who will be appointed by the Municipal Government upon recommendation by the Social Affairs Bureau. There will be three groups under them: general affairs, fundraising, and accounting. The most important relief facilities will include: (1) Home for the Elderly, (2) Infant Home, (3) Orphanage, (4) Home for the Disabled, (5) Vocational Training Center, (6) Women's Training Center, (7) Maternity Clinic, (8) Almshouse, (9) Other.</p>
<h3>Over 700,000 Japanese Nationals and Prisoners of War to be Concentrated in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Port Transportation Headquarters, established to handle the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war from various parts of Central China, was officially established a few days ago. Regarding the general situation of the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war, Major General Xie Hao, who also serves as the commander, told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the total number of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war currently scattered throughout Central China is 733,134. They will soon be transported to Shanghai in batches to await ships for repatriation. So far, there have been three batches repatriated, carrying a total of 11,150 Japanese nationals and prisoners of war back east. Additionally, six U.S. landing ships were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday to take the fourth batch of 6,000 Japanese prisoners of war back to Japan. However, the ships did not arrive yesterday but are expected to arrive today. Starting from January next year, there will be over sixty ships of various sizes each month dedicated to transporting Japanese nationals and prisoners of war back to their country. Because both the Chinese and American authorities are eager to repatriate these Japanese individuals as soon as possible, the U.S. Shanghai Port Command and the U.S. Headquarters of the China Theater are working closely with our Shanghai Port Transportation Headquarters to carry out the operation. Regarding the investigation of Japanese war criminals, Xie stated that the list of Japanese individuals to be repatriated will first be submitted to the War Crimes Investigation Department for review. Those who are approved to return to Japan will then be concentrated in designated locations. The former site of the Shanghai Municipal Government is currently being used as the concentration site. Their luggage, personal belongings, and bodies will be jointly inspected by customs officers, police, and military police. After the inspection, trucks will transport the luggage, women, and children to the Qujiang Wharf to board the ships, while the men will walk to the wharf.</p>
<h3>Newsreel of Chairman's Visit to Beiping to be Screened Starting Today</h3>
<p>The "Special Newsreel of Chairman Chiang's Visit to Beiping," recently filmed by the Central Film Studio, chronicles Chairman Chiang's meetings with elders in Beiping, visits to the Palace Museum and museums, a speech to students in the Taihe Hall, and the grand welcome of Chairman's visit to Beiping by the citizens. It premiered yesterday with very satisfactory results. Starting today, it will be screened concurrently with Cai Chusheng's "A Bright Future" and the newsreel of Marshall's audience with Chairman Chiang in Nanjing at the Grand Theater and the Nanjing Theater.</p>
<h3>No Country May Exercise Arrest Powers within Our Borders – Statement by Chen Guolian of the Foreign Ministry Office</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding recent reports of the French Consul General in Shanghai arresting over a dozen French Nazi members in Shanghai, this reporter specifically visited Chen Guolian, Director of the Foreign Ministry Office in Shanghai. Mr. Chen stated: The consular jurisdiction of various countries in China was announced as abolished long ago, and relevant countries have successively signed new treaties with our country.</p>
<p>For countries that have not signed new treaties with us or a couple that have not yet announced the cancellation of consular jurisdiction in China, whether their consular jurisdiction in China still exists remains technically questionable. However, this is only a question. In principle, these countries have long been considered to no longer enjoy this special treatment. Therefore, by-products attached to consular jurisdiction that existed unilaterally, such as the former Japanese consular police, are certainly not allowed to be retained, and are absolutely not allowed to operate within our country. As for the agreement that the Allied countries signed to address the jurisdictional management of troops stationed in each other's countries, which was based on wartime needs and to facilitate overseas troop management when they fought alongside our country years ago, where our country signed such with Britain and America. However, this was purely based on wartime needs and was of an absolute</p>
<p>reciprocal nature.</p>
<p>For example, our troops stationed in India, Burma, and other British or American territories or jurisdictions enjoy such treatment. France does not have a similar agreement with our country, and its consular jurisdiction in China is also considered to have been abolished. If, as reported, there is indeed the fact of exercising arrest powers within our country, it is a violation of rights and illegal, and should bear legal responsibility. However, Mr. Chen himself has only seen this in the news. The details of the situation are being thoroughly investigated in conjunction with relevant authorities. Once it is verified to be true, the government will handle it according to the law.</p>
<p>In addition, this office will officially start operating at the former Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road next New Year's Day. The personnel of the office are currently en route to Shanghai from Chongqing. Currently, the work focuses on the reception and handling of enemy and puppet diplomatic administrative agencies and their properties. Once the office location is established and the personnel are sufficient, matters such as visa applications and passport issuance will be handled.</p>
<h3>Construction of Martyrs' Shrine to Commemorate Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Third War Area Command, in order to commemorate the fallen soldiers, has specially established a Martyrs' Shrine on the original site of the former Shanghai Shrine on Jiangwan Road as a memorial. Wang Guanghan, Hu Jingru, Gou Jitang, Zhang _, and Zou Renzhi have been appointed to be responsible for the preparations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Foreign Relations Association Holds Meeting of Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese National Foreign Relations Association held its first joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the first session yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Over forty directors and supervisors attended, including Yan Huifeng and Li Jilan. Yan Huiqing served as the chairman. On the spot, it was resolved to invite Soong Ching-ling, Qian Dajun, Tang Enbo, Wu Shaoshu, Gu Zhutong, Kong Xiangxi, Li Deng_ _, Liu Hongsheng, Qian Xinzhi, and Li Zhaoshi as honorary directors. The meeting passed the proposals submitted by the general assembly and the work plans, and resolved to organize an Allied Nations inspection group. Finally, the standing directors were elected. It is learned that Yan Huiqing, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Xi Yushu, Wang _xiao, Gu Yuxiu, Rong Hongyuan, Qian Jianqiu, and Zhong Ketuo were elected as the first session of standing directors of the association. Furthermore, the association has decided to hold the first meeting of the first session of standing directors at noon on the 31st, still at the YMCA.</p>
<h3>French Consul General Philip Offers Cocktail Reception</h3>
<p>The French Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, held a cocktail party at his private residence yesterday evening at 5:30 p.m. Those in attendance included our side's Deputy Mayor, Commander Li, Generals Lan and Tengshang Zhenbing, Councilor Zhang Yishu, Feng Youzhen of the Central Propaganda Department, Special Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry Chen Guolian, and many other dignitaries. From the American side were General Wedemeyer, General Stratemeyer, General Barbee, the British Consul, and the Director of the Press Office, among others. In addition, there were over thirty French dignitaries and military personnel in Shanghai, as well as over a hundred guests. They laughed, talked, and drank, creating a splendid scene for a time.</p>
<h3>General Wedemeyer to Receive Reporters Today</h3>
<p>General Wedemeyer is scheduled to receive Chinese and foreign reporters from the city at 11:00 a.m. today (the 29th) in the conference room on the eighth floor of the Construction Building. All participating reporters must bring the reporter pass issued by the former U.S. Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Shipping Date Postponed Due to Unclear Sea Obstacles</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Taikoo Company's Beihai vessel, managed by the British Far East Shipping Management Office, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th after its first post-war voyage from Hong Kong via Shantou. The arrival was later changed to yesterday. According to the manager's announcement yesterday, the ship was expected to arrive at 8:00 a.m. this morning. However, due to the incomplete clearance of obstacles at sea, the journey was slower, and the arrival date could not be determined. The vessel's departure from Shanghai to Hong Kong, originally scheduled for the 30th, was also postponed to the end of the month due to the delay, with export to Hong Kong scheduled for New Year's Day. The English ship Bromisthesis, from the American port of Philidelphia, carrying 6,700 packages of relief wheat to China managed by the same office was expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th. However, as of dusk, there was no news of its arrival. Suddenly, the manager announced: the vessel was diverted to arrive today; yesterday, according to reliable information from the shipping industry, the vessel encountered difficulties approximately 90 nautical miles from Wusongkou, near Sheshan Ocean, while sailing two days prior. The details are unknown, and it is feared that the vessel will not be able to enter the port today.</p>
<p>Coal Shortage in Shanghai, Continuously Transported to Hankou</p>
<p>Due to the coal shortage in Shanghai, coal has been continuously transported to provide assistance. Currently, 2,000 tons need to be transported to Hankou. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched three ships, the Jiangning, Tongmeng, and Jiang'an, for transportation. The Jiangning ship, loaded with 800 tons, is scheduled to sail to Hankou today. The Tongmeng ship is also loaded with 800 tons and will sail upstream tomorrow. The Jiang'an ship arrived in Shanghai today and is scheduled to sail to Hankou next Monday, also carrying 400 tons. Approximately 70,000 to 80,000 tons of coal are shipped from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai each month.</p>
<p>Lightship Aground Near Huangzhou</p>
<p>The lightship near Huangzhou on the Yangtze River waterway is aground, and the water level in Hankou has receded. According to a telegram from Hankou received by the shipping industry, the Customs Yangtze River Navigation Affairs Office issued a temporary navigation notice stating that the lightship is currently aground on the sand. From the Huangzhou Pagoda, the bearing of the lightship aground is 306 degrees, 2.82 nautical miles. It is currently used as a shore navigation marker, with a class 6 translucent light. Upstream vessels should keep a distance of three cables from the left bank. After passing the lower Huangzhou dock, the port side of the vessel should be three cables apart from the starboard side of the lightship. Vessels should navigate between ships during daylight hours until further notice regarding the lightship. The water level at the location was 17 feet on the 23rd of this month, and the water level in Hankou was 9 feet 7 inches. Please inform all upstream vessels, etc. All shipping agencies have been notified to advise captains to pay attention after receiving the information. It is also learned that the waterways of Beiyang Tianjin, Baihe, Qinhuangdao, and other rivers freeze every winter, and navigation is suspended. Import and export vessels can only moor outside the port. However, this year is exceptional, and navigation is still possible without freezing.</p>
<p>Fare Regulations for Nanyang Routes</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will soon resume navigation on the Nanyang routes and has set the following fares: (1) From Shanghai to Xiamen: Special Class 33,450, First Class 32,800, Second Class 15,550, Third Class 9,750, Fourth Class 6,600.

<p>Passenger and Cargo Registration for Minyu Vessel Handled</p>
<p>The Minsheng Company's Minyu vessel has been missing for a week since the accident on the night of the 22nd. All cargo carried by the ship was salvaged on the 26th, and attorney Wei Wenda has been entrusted to handle compensation matters for passengers and cargo owners' losses. Regarding the salvage of the Minyu vessel, the company has dispatched six divers who are working underwater all day. So far, one-third of the ship's hull has emerged from the water, and it is expected to be completely salvaged in about a week. The total loss is estimated to be over ten million yuan. The cause of the accident needs to be determined by experts after the Minyu vessel is salvaged.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Price-Controlled Oil to be Sold Next Week - Each Person Can Purchase Five Jin</h3>
<p>The first price-controlled sale of cooking oil in the city is scheduled to begin on January 5th next year. The total amount is approximately 8,000 dan or more, including 6,000 dan of rapeseed oil, 1,000 dan of soybean oil, and approximately 1,500 dan of raw oil. The prices are set at 125 yuan per jin for rapeseed and soybean oil, and 140 yuan per jin for raw oil. Each citizen can purchase approximately five jin. The cooking oil has been shipped from the "Yoshida" oil factory in Pudong since yesterday.

However, there will be no restrictions on the quantity of price-controlled oil distributed, and the actual sales volume of each retailer will be used as the standard.</p>
<p>Scalpers Discovered During the Fifth Phase of Price-Controlled Cloth Sales</p>
<p>During the fifth phase of price-controlled cloth sales, the five major companies on Nanjing Road have been selling for the past three days, and the crowd of purchasers has been very large. The situation is different from the fourth phase of sales for two reasons: one is that the prices set in the previous phase were too high, and the bleached cloth received by the companies has not yet been sold out. They are currently seeking instructions from the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau on how to handle it. The other is that the foreign exchange gold price was falling at that time, and purchasers were taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, the companies have discovered scalpers buying up the cloth. Yesterday morning, the Tashing Company's iron gate at the price-controlled sales area was damaged due to the scalpers, and two people were injured. One was a child named Miao Fa, an apprentice at the Meishin Shirt Factory, who suffered a fractured forehead and teeth. The other was a woman whose foot bone was crushed. Both were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The cloth being bought up by the scalpers is the Laba Jian brand fine cloth. Each person can purchase ten zhang for 8,000 yuan each time. As soon as they leave the company's door, someone buys it for 11,000 yuan. It is hoped that the authorities will strictly enforce the law and crack down on this.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Textile Enterprise Council, Dong Yanzhang, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dong Yanzhang, Chairman of the Textile Enterprise Management Committee of the Executive Yuan and concurrently General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, flew to Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday. He will establish the general company in Shanghai to take over enemy and puppet yarn factories and their affiliated businesses. Accompanying him were Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the Company, Wang Dashui, Director of the Secretariat, and Zhang Zhaozhi, Director of the Audit Department.</p>
<h3>Jeep Crashes into Police Booth</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) At approximately 10:10 PM on the 26th, at the public bus ticketing booth at the old west gate in the southern district, a large jeep belonging to the American military drove by at high speed and crashed into the booth. The police officer Liu Dafu, who was standing next to the booth, sustained a severe injury to his left ankle. The vehicle was sent to a police hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Director of the Taiwan Agricultural and Forestry Department Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Fertilizer Shortage</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Zhao Lianfang, Director of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, who had just flown to Shanghai from Taiwan. When asked about the agricultural and forestry situation in Taiwan, he answered as follows: (1) The rice production in Taiwan this year is approximately 4.9 million taishi (approximately 1.8 shishi). Before the war, the production was over 9.5 million taishi. The reason for the decrease in production is the lack of fertilizer, insufficient rainfall, and the reduction in the number of farmers due to enlistment. The total food consumption in Taiwan is approximately 6.4 million taishi, so Taiwan's rice supply is still insufficient. (2) There are approximately 3 million farmers in Taiwan. Their working methods are similar to those in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, but they are accustomed to using chemical fertilizers. (3) The quality of the rice produced is very good, similar to the japonica rice produced in Jiangnan. (4) The chemical fertilizer required for all the farmland in Taiwan is several hundred thousand tons, which was previously imported from Japan, but the source has now been cut off. (5) In order to expand rice production, the area of sugarcane land has been reduced as much as possible. (6) The main task of this trip is to discuss and resolve Taiwan's fertilizer problem, and he is scheduled to return to Taiwan in early next week.</p>
<h3>The 35th New Year's Day is Approaching Soon - All Sectors are Preparing for Grand Celebrations</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The first New Year's Day after the victory is coming in three days. All sectors of the city are currently preparing for grand celebrations to express their enthusiasm for the nation's future and the upcoming national construction efforts. The joint Party, government, and military conference decided on the methods to comfort the Allied forces and American troops stationed in China the day before yesterday. In addition to generally distributing comfort items, the municipal authorities will also invite Allied soldiers to gather for a celebration to thank them for their hard work and contributions to the Allied war effort and their time stationed in China. The municipal government and its affiliated bureaus will only take one day off during New Year's Day to expedite their work, and other industries will follow this example, as they do not want to miss this good trading opportunity. However, the banking industry will continue to take three days off as usual for year-end closing, and will resume business as usual from the 4th. Movie theaters are competing to show the most exciting new movies to entertain guests, and Beijing opera and drama theaters will add evening performances. The football league organized by the Municipal Sports Association will also launch its first major battle on New Year's Day. Citizens are planning where to spend this joyful holiday to release the frustrations they have suffered for the past eight years. Recently, there have been rumors that the curfew will be lifted during the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays. A reporter from this newspaper inquired with the relevant authorities and learned that this is not the case. However, a special pass will be issued on New Year's Eve similar to Christmas. In addition to Allied military and civilians, Chinese citizens with legitimate reasons can also apply to the municipal government for a pass. Those without a pass will still be strictly prohibited from traveling during curfew hours. Citizens are advised to pay attention.</p>
<h3>All Zhejiang Associations Hold Tea Party - Welcome Sun Xiaolou Yesterday - Hope to Actively Promote Relief Work</h3>
<p>The All Zhejiang Associations, together with the Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Quzhou, Fenghua, Zhenhai, Dinghai, Huzhou, Xiangshan, and other Shanghai-based native place associations, held a tea party at 3:00 p.m. yesterday on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association to welcome Sun Xiaolou, Director of the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to express their welcome and to present the relief needs in various places.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Over fifty people attended including He Bingsong, He Dekui, Liu Hongsheng, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Yansong, and other Zhejiang natives in Shanghai, as well as representatives from various native place associations. Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, saying that the counties of Zhejiang Province have suffered severely during the eight years of the war of resistance, and the disaster-stricken people after the war are urgently in need of relief. He hoped that Director Sun would tell them about the principles and steps for Zhejiang's relief. At the same time, he also hoped that everyone present would tell Director Sun about the disaster situation in Zhejiang's counties and the real need for relief as a reference for providing assistance.</p>
<p>Three Major Principles</p>
<p>Director Sun said in his speech that during the eight years of the War of Resistance, most of the counties in Zhejiang Province were occupied, and millions of people were in deep water and fire. He will follow the Central Government's orders and local public opinion to do his best to carry out relief work, adhering to three principles: (1) Speed: Distribute all relief supplies quickly to those who need relief. (2) Fairness: We will provide relief to those who truly need relief. We will absolutely not provide relief to those who are living well and trying to obtain relief supplies. (3) Universality: Provide relief to the general public suffering from disasters.</p>
<p>Key Points of Relief</p>
<p>The office currently has several important things to do in Zhejiang and Fujian: (1) Eradicate plague and malaria. (2) Relieve the food shortage. (3) Revive agriculture and fisheries. In addition, the seawalls near Haiyan and other counties are also planned to be repaired to prevent floods. Representatives from various villages and associations then expressed their opinions. A Shaoxing representative hoped that relief work would go deep into the countryside, with towns more important than cities. A Jiaxing representative said that Jiaxing needs mulberry saplings, silkworm eggs, and fertilizer. A Taizhou representative said that they need medicines and cotton seeds. A Dinghai representative appealed for relief to the fishermen in Dinghai and its surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Eight Opinions</p>
<p>Finally, Wang Xiaolai summarized the views of all parties and added his own opinions, putting forward eight points for Director Sun to pay attention to: (1) Agriculture and coastal fisheries in the whole province, (2) Water conservancy of the Qiantang River and Cao'e River, (3) Silk industry in western Zhejiang, (4) Cotton industry near Xiaoshan and Yuyao, (5) Tea industry in Shaoxing, (6) Pharmaceutical industry, (7) Construction, the post-war construction of various counties was severely damaged by the enemy, and there were many people who were homeless, (8) The restoration of transportation.</p>
<h3>Yang Changji's Trial Concluded Yesterday - Sentencing Scheduled - Served as a Japanese Military Police Assistant and Committed Many Evils</h3>
<p>The traitor Yang Changji served as a Japanese military police assistant in the Japanese Northern Railway Station Military Police Team for many years during the enemy-puppet era. He was responsible for inspecting luggage and goods at the Northern Railway Station. All valuable luggage and goods of merchants traveling to and from the station were often confiscated by him without cause. After the Japanese surrendered, Yang fled to other places in an attempt to escape justice.</p>
<p>Traitor Arrested on Train to Shanghai</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in early October of this year, Yang was taking a train to Shanghai at Kunshan Railway Station, and he happened to be seen by the victims Wang Lianfang, Wang Ada, and other solo merchants. The Wangs followed him to Shanghai, and after getting off the train, they took him to the military police team. After questioning by the team, he was transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation and verification. The office then filed a public prosecution with the High Court in accordance with Article 2, Section 8 of the Regulations on Punishment of Traitors. Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., Judge Liu _gui, Cao Jun, Zhu Zonghai, and Prosecutor Lin Wopeng of the High Court opened a court meeting for trial. Yang initially tried to deny his actions in every possible way. The court temporarily detained him and summoned the informant Wang Lianfang to court. According to Wang, "I used to be a solo merchant. In 1941, I carried a box of western medicine, planning to take it to Jinhua by train for sale. Unexpectedly, it was found by Yang and confiscated. Because Jinhua was still in the hands of the National Army at that time, the Japanese military police suspected that I was related to the government and subjected me to torture. First, they poured cold water on me, and then they whipped me with leather whips. Fortunately, I was released soon. There were dozens of such incidents every day.</p>
<p>Solo Female Merchant Sexually Assaulted</p>
<p>Yang's biggest crime was that any vulnerable woman running a solo business, if she had any beauty, could not escape his clutches. Yang Changji, also known as Little Yang, had more than ten wives and concubines. Travelers would tremble at his name as if he were a demon. My complaint against him this time is only to seek justice for countless victims." At this time, the court summoned Yang Changji to court again and confronted him with the facts provided by the plaintiff. However, Yang still tried to deny it, claiming that Wang had personal grudges against him, that he did not serve as a Japanese military police assistant, and that he only worked as a supervisor at the Mitsubishi Wharf. However, the court considered that the case was clear, and after the defendant's lawyer made a defense for Yang, the court decided that the case would be sentenced at 2:00 p.m. on January 4.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Request a Mission to Comfort Nanyang</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese from various regions in Shanghai, including Lin Chaopin, Huang Qinshu, and prominent figures such as Li Denghui and He Bingsong, believe that while the motherland has been restored, overseas Chinese are still in deep water and fire. They have jointly petitioned Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government, requesting that a high-ranking official be sent to comfort the overseas Chinese in Nanyang, the Dutch East Indies, and Vietnam. In addition, in the name of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Association, they have sent telegrams to overseas Chinese in various regions to express their condolences.</p>
<h3>Radio Registration: Regulations Established for Application Procedures</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of radio registration, the Electricity Supervision Section has stipulated six requirements for application and installation. They are recorded below: (1) Register first in the temporary investigation register, then obtain an application form from the administrator. (2) The number of application forms issued shall be based on the number of radios owned by the applicant, one form per radio. (3) Please fill in all items on the application form in detail. The applicant should sign and affix a seal. If it is a business, also affix the business stamp. (4) The applicant should simultaneously apply to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications (No. 4 Shiqing Road, Yokohama Bridge) for a registration certificate to verify and issue the required documents. (5) The application form should be submitted to the Ministry before the end of this month, either in person or by mail. (6) If there are unclear procedures or questions, the administrator can be consulted at any time.

<h3>Relief Agency Issues Flour: Thorough Investigation Procedures</h3>
<p>The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's second phase of flour distribution began yesterday (the 28th). Purchasers are required to complete payment procedures at the bank first. The agency is conducting very thorough investigations of each applicant merchant. It is reported that a small number of retailers could not be investigated because their addresses were unclear. Moreover, it is inevitable that some have no store at all, while others are not flour retailers at all. To prevent this, the agency will immediately collect and suspend the issuance of registration certificates for these applicants when they make payments at the Zhongfu Bank. Those whose addresses are unclear or whose house numbers are incorrect, etc., can submit a written explanation to the agency, which will send staff to reinvestigate. If they are indeed flour retailers, the certificate will be reissued. It is heard that the same situation has not yet occurred for applications from other noodle shops, noodle and dim sum shops, and bakeries.</p>
<p>Old Clothes and Shoes to be Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Canadian Relief Department of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, in order to provide relief to the people affected by the war in various countries, launched a voluntary donation program. A large number of the donated materials are intended to be shipped to our country. As of the end of October, the amount of used clothing and shoes designated for distribution to refugees in our country has reached 720,000 pounds. The Canadian people are enthusiastically donating, and the effort has not diminished. It is now learned that the Canadian Relief Department has decided to allocate another 360,000 pounds of used clothing and shoes to refugees in our country. As soon as these relief supplies are packaged, they will be shipped to China in full by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<h3>Nine Soldiers Detained for Disturbing Cinema</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At approximately 2:15 PM yesterday, while a film was playing at the Huguang Cinema on Zhongzheng Middle Road, seven or eight soldiers suddenly burst into the manager's office, demanding fifteen complimentary tickets. When a female employee surnamed Guan asked if they had a coupon or proof of identification, one soldier, without asking why, grabbed the telephone receiver from the table and threw it. The manager, Shi Tingpan, politely tried to reason with him, but was struck on the head with a gun butt, causing him to bleed profusely. Several other soldiers waited outside the room. Hearing the commotion inside, they immediately smashed the six large glass doors at the entrance. Several others then rushed upstairs, destroying all the glass windows on the second and third floors. The audience at the first showing, seeing this situation, scattered in all directions, causing great disorder. Tables and chairs were extensively damaged. At that moment, a patrol team from the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters happened to pass by. After receiving a report, they entered the cinema and detained the nine soldiers responsible for the incident for investigation. The injured manager, Shi Tingpan, took himself to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>US Military Offices Use Electric Heaters for Warmth</h3>
<p>After Christmas, the winter weather here is getting colder, and the air is chilly in the early mornings and evenings. For several years, offices and residential areas have lacked stoves and heating equipment. The heating equipment in large buildings and hotels was mostly dismantled or damaged by the Japanese and is no longer usable. The U.S. military mostly uses electric heaters in the buildings and apartments they occupy, while offices mostly use coal stoves. According to a report from the US military headquarters engineer, since the beginning of winter, the US military has installed as many as sixty or seventy stoves in various offices for heating. US military personnel traveling in jeeps often cover their knees with military blankets. The business of bars has been even better since the weather turned cold. The US military says that drinking can ward off some of the cold.</p>

<h3>Secrets of the Atlantic Undersea War</h3>
<p>— Li Mu</p>
<p>In 1942, German submarines sank 1,161 British and American merchant ships. If Hitler's submarine weapons had continued this destructive efficiency, Britain would have been unable to survive long ago, the Soviet Union would not have been victorious, and the Far East war against Japan and the fate of Britain and the United States would have been unimaginable. Both sides knew that this was a life-and-death struggle. Therefore, the United States transferred 1.5 million troops to the Atlantic and mobilized thousands of famous scientists to study day and night how to resist Germany's secret weapons.</p>
<p>Acoustic Torpedoes</p>
<p>The first secret underwater weapon used by Germany was an acoustic torpedo. After the torpedo was fired from the submarine's launcher in the direction of the enemy ship, it would seek out the sound emitted by the ship's propellers. This "acoustic torpedo," like a hound sniffing out a rabbit, traveled through the water. As long as it heard a faint sound from the ship's propellers, it would follow the sound until it hit the hull and exploded. No matter how the approaching ship turned, it turned even more skillfully; no matter how fast the ship moved, it followed even faster. In addition, it had a terrible ability to seek out the largest target in a group of transport ships and destroy it. When a small ship approached a large ship, the torpedo would immediately turn and head for the ship with the largest hull and the loudest sound.</p>
<p>Sound-Absorbing Rubber</p>
<p>The British and American navies and scientists, to counter this acoustic torpedo, invented a sound emitter, which guided the torpedo to another sound emitter and finally to a place without ships. The invention of British and American radar detectors caused great panic among the Germans, because radar used subtle sound waves on the seabed, and when it touched the entity of a submarine, there would be an echo, revealing the location of the submarine. The Germans invented a rubber that wrapped around the entire submarine, and when sound waves touched it, they would be absorbed by the rubber. Germany finally researched and developed sound-absorbing rubber, the effect of which was that if a room was sealed with this rubber, two people talking to each other in the room could not hear each other at all. Subsequently, they invented a gelatinous substance to stick the rubber to the submarine. But this rubber still caused some echo of sound waves. They also invented an underwater gun that fired chemical projectiles that could emit sound, disturbing sound waves.</p>
<p>Wolf Pack Strategy</p>
<p>German submarine strategy had three major reforms, one of which was the "wolf pack strategy." Cruising submarines were gathered in one place, and only when their numbers exceeded those of the British and American escort fleets would they attack together. The British and Americans used bomber groups equipped with radar and bombs to disrupt this strategy. Because submarines must surface after being submerged for twenty-four hours to release the fuel fumes in the submarine's cabin, and they lost their power when they surfaced. As a result, they researched and developed a diesel ventilator that could double the speed of the submarine at a depth of forty feet below the surface, making British and American aircraft and radar detectors ineffective. But the Germans admitted that this experiment was successful a year and a half late. Hitler's last desperate attempt to send six submarines to attack the US coastline ended with the entire number being sunk by British and American warship nets and aircraft groups after several difficult battles.</p>
<p>The last major German submarine strategy was to improve submarines so that they could go as deep as seven hundred feet below the surface while still maintaining an amazing speed of fifteen knots per hour. Unfortunately, it was too late. Someone asked Admiral Keilpatric; If British and American methods of resisting submarines have progressed so much in the last three years, are submarines still ineffective? He replied: "If Germany has a chance to try again, they will still try using submarines."</p>
<p>Sketch</p>
<h3>Blind News Vendor</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning, I passed the corner of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road and saw a blind news vendor with no sight in his eyes, holding a large stack of newspapers in one hand and a bamboo cane in the other, standing on the sidewalk shouting to sell various daily newspapers. He looked to be just over twenty years old, a handsome young man.</p>
<p>Seeing that blind news vendor, I couldn't help but feel a pang of pity. I immediately bought a few copies from him, watched him for a long time, and wanted to chat with him. My office has all kinds of newspapers, so the reason I bought them from him was originally out of a feeling of compassion. I asked him, "On the street where cars and horses rush around, why do you still sell newspapers when you can't see?" He said, "There's no way. To make a living, I have to sell some newspapers. My hometown is in Dachang, and the war destroyed everything I had. I've been blind since I was a child and attended the Nanjing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf, graduating from there. I am very happy that people like me still have the opportunity to receive education." Hearing the name of the Nanjing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf, I sank into clear memories: Because I had a friend, Mr. Ye Binghua, who had received professional training in teaching the blind and deaf, who served as the director of instruction at that school during the August 13th Incident. When I was in Nanjing, I went there a few times, so I knew more about the situation of that school. I continued to say to him: "Oh, you graduated from the Nanjing School for the Blind and Deaf. That school is very well-run, and the equipment is very complete, with a level equivalent to a fairly complete primary school. Do you still remember Mr. Ye Binghua?" As soon as he heard me mention Mr. Ye's name, his face immediately showed a very kind and joyful expression. He asked me about his recent situation, and I roughly told him some things.</p>
<p>Regarding this blind news vendor in front of me, I found his attitude to be very sincere and his conversation very charming. I then asked about his family background. His words deeply moved me. At this time, I thought of the countless blind people in the world who cannot see even a glimmer of light. Their innate defects rob them of the light of life, which is truly pitiful. He said that although his eyes cannot see anything, his state of mind is very bright. "In these past eight years, my experiences have been extremely bitter. My mother died, my wife and children were separated, and my older brother, the only one who supported the whole family and provided me with school fees, who worked as a teacher at the Zhenjiang Normal School attached primary school before the war, was falsely accused and killed by the Japanese invaders after the war broke out. Since then, my family has been destroyed, and I have been reduced to this state." From his furrowed brow, one could see the pain in his heart, and he finally broke down and lost his voice, like a broken-stringed erhu that could not make a sound. After a long pause, he recounted that although he had encountered misfortune, he still insisted that the profession he chose must be beneficial to education and culture. To uphold national justice and promote spiritual culture, he finally chose the profession of selling newspapers. Although this profession is very difficult, shouting for half a day still cannot support one's life. I couldn't find any words to comfort him, only saying this: "On the multi-forked road of life, be careful of your steps!"</p>
<p>The streets were filled with rushing cars and horses, and the sounds of people were loud, not a place for long conversations. I squeezed through the crowd and looked back at the back of the blind news vendor who had encountered such misery, slowly disappearing into the crowd. I thought about how that blind news vendor's innate defects had deprived him of the happiness of life. I also thought that although he was blind, his childhood experiences were not so bad, with a loving mother and older brother warming his desolate heart, and later with a wife and children who could comfort him. But now everything is over, all become bubbles. I thought even more about the cruelty of the war, which had reduced him to wandering the streets, drifting in an endless and desolate world. Loneliness, sorrow, melancholy, and desolation were certainly already destined for his fate, but I felt that the brilliance of his personality would always make people feel that his heart was bright, perhaps even brighter than those with sight—righteousness and wisdom shining brightly on his heart, without any flaws. He was not like some sighted people, who were blinded and obscured by all kinds of poisonous flames of evil, greed, flattery, and meanness.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott once praised the blind, saying that the light in their hearts replaced the light in their eyes. Throughout history, many blind people have achieved many things with their clear minds. The Russian female poet Eroshchenko, who sang about the "desert-like loneliness" of her heart, was blind, but the brilliance of her poems will forever illuminate the world of literature, and her fairy tales have reached the highest level of artistic achievement, unfolding an incomparably bright world before us. Helen Keller in the United States was also blind, but through her perseverance and continuous hard work in the face of her unfortunate circumstances, she eventually completed her university studies, laid the foundation for her scholarship, and eventually became a great social entrepreneur, making a great contribution to humanity. Although the blind do not have light in their eyes, they can pursue a bright future.</p>
<p>Victor Hugo, the great French writer, was the precursor of Romanticism. In a novel of his, he described a blind musician who, with his extraordinary musical talent, played out his desolate and bitter experience on a three-stringed instrument, deeply moving people. An architect who had the same experiences as him was so moved by his art of "empathy" that tears streamed down his face in front of everyone. Maupassant also had a story about a blind female worker who, with her crisp and melodious singing voice, moved the audience and found a lifelong companion in her desolate life journey, the main medium being a song.</p>
<p>The blind news vendor I encountered this time had deep pain hidden in his heart. How could he tell people about it? He was not the poet, social entrepreneur, musician, or singer mentioned earlier. His sorrow was much deeper than those blind artists because he could not express his feelings and innermost thoughts. His pain was forever hidden deep in his heart, yet his contribution to society was very great. He did not choose other professions commonly done by the blind but sold newspapers on the roadside like a tiger's mouth. He himself could not directly receive the spiritual and cultural nourishment but distributed this precious nourishment to others to enjoy. What a noble profession!</p>
<p>I heard that the "Daily Mail" in England has a braille edition specially published for the blind, so the blind can learn about the world's major events, national and social news every day. After listening to the blind news vendor, I felt that he was indeed a young man full of a sense of justice, and his thirst for knowledge was very strong. But who will satisfy him? When will he have the right to read newspapers?</p>
<p>On the way home, I thought about these questions, and I couldn't help but shout: "Save that blind news vendor! Save the blind!"</p>

<h3>Five Kinds of Snails in Ningbo</h3>
<p>— Ji'e (Hates Evil)</p>
<p>During the period when Ningbo was occupied, the suffering of the people was beyond description. Even considering the five kinds of snails that the people compared it to, one can see a glimpse.</p>
<p>(1) Fragrant Snail—Originally, the fragrant snail is a kind of seafood. The people of Yong use it to accompany meals and regard it as a delicacy, but the people use the similar sound of "fragrant snail" to "xiang lu" (鄉擄), referring to the county magistrate, meaning that the county magistrate used the township and town offices as looting agencies.</p>
<p>(2) Field Snail—Field snails are products of farmland everywhere. At that time, the people of Yong said that the township and town chiefs not only supplied the enemy puppet agencies but also entertained the guerrilla units and government agencies, covering all aspects. In addition, the township and town chiefs themselves were also heavily laden with money, buying fields and building houses, and gambling wildly. The source of looting by the township and town chiefs came from farmers, so they recognized the township and town chiefs as "tian lu" (田擄 - field plunderers).</p>
<p>(3) Spicy Snail—The spicy snail is also a seafood product. At that time, puppet army sentry posts were densely distributed. Whenever people passed through their territory, whether they were small businesses or using everyday items, they had to pay taxes. In addition, puppet police were stationed every five steps, extorting along the way, never letting go. The people therefore called these people "le" (勒 - force) "lu" (擄 - plunderers) (in the Yong dialect, "block" and "force" have the same sound).</p>
<p>(4) Snail—The people of Su call it "luo," while the people of Yong call it "si luo." In fact, they are the same thing. At that time, the guerrilla units, out of concern for the enemy puppets, did not dare to openly demand from the people when they needed something, so they had to send letters to threaten or secretly negotiate, mostly settling privately. Therefore, the people of Ningbo called the sea guerrilla units "si lu" (私擄 - private plunderers) (si luo - 螄螺).</p>
<p>(5) Mud Snail—The mud snail is also a seafood product. In the past, Mr. Yu Qiaqing would not be happy without this when having meals at banquets. However, the mud snail referred to by the people of Ningbo at that time referred to the bandit army. Because the bandit army would go to the countryside to eat and live during the autumn harvest every year, it was called "nian lu" (年擄 - annual plunderers) (ni luo - 泥螺).</p>

<h3>A First Look at the Newsreel of Chairman's Visit to Beiping</h3>
<p>— Mo Ying</p>
<p>The events of Chairman Chiang's visit to Beiping were filmed by China Electric and transported to Shanghai. The reporter had the honor of seeing it first, for which I am extremely grateful. The film captures the scenery of Beiping and depicts the frenzy of the general public after the Chairman and his wife arrived in Beiping, as if painted vividly. The Chairman's admonitions to the elders of Beiping are earnest and moving. The sound recording is clear, as if we were gathered together. The Chairman's visit to the Ancient Relics Exhibition Hall, although the indoor lighting is not good, the shots are still clear. Generals like Li Zongren are also on camera. The grand scene of addressing the students in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, which was recently filmed, is particularly magnificent and great. No less than hundreds of thousands of students from various schools were in attendance, with flags flying and lines neatly arranged. The Chairman encouraged the youth to strengthen their bodies, cultivate their character, and diligently study, as well as follow the Three Principles of the People. He also expressed much consolation for the oppression and suffering endured by the people of Beiping during the War of Resistance. For a time, the students' shouts shook the heavens and the earth. The collective excitement of the youth of North China was unprecedented in decades. After the speech, the students spontaneously rushed to the high platform, surrounding the Chairman. The Chairman traveled lightly that day, readily approaching the youth. The reporter was greatly moved by viewing this film. The newsreel will soon be seen by audiences in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Reviving the National Calendar</h3>
<p>— Xiyuan</p>
<p>The Republic of China has been established for thirty-four years, but the most important "zhenshuo" (正朔 - official calendar) of the nation, which is changing to the solar calendar, that is, the "national calendar" that defines the name and distinguishes the roles, has still not been universally implemented. This is a great disgrace to the nation and internationally. Now, countries around the world, including England, do not use the solar calendar, and some people have argued that the solar calendar is not yet suitable and should be replaced with other new calendars. In our country, since the official promulgation of the use of the solar calendar in the first year of the Republic, the government offices have implemented the solar calendar on the surface, but in reality, the general public, such as the education and business sectors, still use the lunar calendar, but they only take one day off during the solar New Year. This is still forgivable in the rural countryside, and there is still some reason to say that it is because they have to rely on the twenty-four solar terms to farm. But in the cities, using it on the surface but not in practice, what is called "yang feng yin wei" (陽奉陰違 - outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient) is really too inappropriate!</p>
<p>In the past, the Japanese invaders occupied the coastal provinces and vigorously promoted the lunar calendar in Shanghai and Nanjing. They celebrated the solar New Year in Hongkou with great excitement, letting us celebrate the lunar New Year, indicating that China was backward, old-fashioned, and a "phenomenon of national subjugation." Therefore, whenever there were lunar festivals, such as the "Mid-Autumn Festival" and the "Dragon Boat Festival," they were also particularly energetic. Mooncakes and zongzi were expensive in those eight years, but sales were higher than in previous years. The general public thought it was a matter of course, and some people thought it was the "benevolent governance" of the Japanese invaders. As for the official calendar of the Republic of China, it had long been thrown to the winds.</p>
<p>Now that the War of Resistance has been won, everything must be revived and restored. I recall that in the years 1935 and 1936, the central government strictly ordered all localities to implement the national calendar and abolish the old calendar. On Lunar New Year's Day, schools had to hold classes, workers had to go to work, businesses were not allowed to close, and newspapers were not allowed to stop publishing. At that time, it was carried out vigorously, and the national spirit and the atmosphere of Shanghai were revitalized. At that time, there was also the New Life Movement Promotion Association, which worked hard to publicize and promote the slogans of the national calendar, which were all over the walls. If there had been no War of Resistance against Japan, perhaps the national calendar would have been universally implemented by now.</p>
<p>Now, the thirty-fourth year of the Republic has come to an end. The general public does not seem to be interested in the New Year's Day of the thirty-fifth year, as if they still have to wait for the Lunar New Year to have a good time. This is really inappropriate. I hope that the government and the New Life Movement Promotion Association will reaffirm the clear orders, as vigorously as in the years 1935 and 1936, and launch another official calendar movement. This is what the author hopes for very much!</p>

<h3>Ambition</h3>
<p>— Shanmin (Mountain Dweller)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, everyone has ambition. However, ambition has differences in size, good and bad, and whether it can be realized.</p>
<p>The size of ambition varies according to each person's age and environment. The younger the age, the smaller the ambition is likely to be; the better the environment, the larger the ambition is likely to be. There are countless examples of this.</p>
<p>The goodness or badness of ambition varies according to its nature. All who are willing to serve the public and are willing to sacrifice themselves when necessary have good ambitions; conversely, those who hope to enslave and sacrifice others to seek their own happiness have bad ambitions. From this, we can find a dividing line between good and bad ambitions.</p>
<p>Whether an ambition can be realized depends first on whether the ambition is good or bad, second on whether the ambition has the possibility of being realized, and third on the degree of personal ability and determination. If an ambition is good and can be realized, and has the ability and determination, it will inevitably be realized.</p>
<p>We should have ambition so that the power of life can be expressed; however, this ambition must be based on benefiting others; otherwise, it will not only ruin ourselves but also implicate others.</p>

<h3>Advice for the Temporary University</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>Editor: Your newspaper published news on the screening for the preparatory class of the Temporary University on the 26th. Here are some of my opinions. Please publish it in the social services section for the students of the Temporary University. The preparatory class of the Temporary University only has two groups, arts and sciences. Under the circumstances of repeated loss of schooling, I had no choice but to apply to the science group. Although I deeply know that the science group is not very similar to the business courses I studied before, the business courses such as bookkeeping, accounting, typing, and abacus are not within the scope of the screening, and I have never studied the science subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology, analytical geometry, and higher algebra. This screening invisibly gave me a big blow. I hope that the authorities of the preparatory class of the Temporary University will first examine the schools and eliminate the students of the schools that are now non-existent or cannot be considered satisfactory. In this way, on the one hand, the trouble of "overcrowding" can be reduced, and on the other hand, it can serve as a warning to those who set up rogue schools. The second step is to classify the high school courses of each student, such as science, engineering, and business, and then conduct the screening. Although this is a more troublesome procedure, it is the most common method.</p>
<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Searching for Sun Tianmin (also known as Sun Ruochen)</p>
<p>A native of Shandong, he served as a director at the Shanghai Dadong Film Company before the war. After the August 13th Incident, he joined Wu Lizhu's troupe in Nanyang, and then served as the director of the Hong Kong New World Film Company, and then transferred to Taishan Film Company as the chief director. At that time, there was still news from home, but since the Pacific War, there has been no news at all. If anyone knows his whereabouts, please send a letter to No. 5 Qing'an Lane, Dingnan Road, which would be a great merit.</p>
<p>Xu Wenwei, a native of Chongde County, Zhejiang, once worked in a large cloth shop in Hangzhou. He usually expressed his desire to join the army. He suddenly went missing when victory was near, and has been missing for several months with no news at all. His mother has passed away, and his father is old and sick with longing for his son. If anyone knows his whereabouts, please send a letter to Mr. Wu at No. 82 Hengkang, East Chang'an Street, Zhejiang, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Zhang Chenglian is looking for his son Zhang Wenxun, a native of Lujiang, Anhui, who served as the principal of the Jianyi Elementary School of Chaotian Palace Gongjianfang in Nanjing for many years. After the outbreak of the war, he moved inland with the government. Two years ago, someone met Xun on the way to Hengyang. According to him, he was serving in the 1st Honorary Division at that time, living in Liuzhou. Unfortunately, his address was not recorded, and there has been no communication for eight years. His mother has come to Shanghai from Liyang to seek refuge, making a living on her own. She is very poor, crying day and night, and has fallen ill with longing for her son. If any friends or classmates of Wenxun know his whereabouts, please send a letter to "No. 5, Lane 552, Hed Road, Shanghai," so that the noble son can reunite with his family as soon as possible, and the grace of rebirth will be infinitely grateful.</p>

<h3>On Worry-Free Smoking Cessation (4)</h3>
<p>— Hu Qipeng</p>
<p>V. Methods and Selection of Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>Smoking cessation methods can be briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Gradual Reduction Method: This method uses several kinds of anesthetic drugs to gradually reduce the amount, so as to cut off the smoking habit and avoid the pain of withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>(2) Serum Smoking Cessation Method: This method involves drawing a certain amount of the smoker's own blood every day and injecting it into their muscles to resist nicotine poisoning, or using a drug applied to the skin to make it blister, and then drawing the serum from the blister and injecting it back into the human body, which is the blistering smoking cessation method. However, this method still needs to be used with a gradual reduction of appropriate anesthetics, but the abstinence period can be shortened due to the injection of serum.</p>
<p>(3) Sleep Smoking Cessation Method: This method uses a considerable amount of sleeping pills to make the abstinent person unconscious, unaware of the pain of addiction, and achieve the purpose of abstinence in about three to five days. This is the so-called drunken rapid abstinence method, but if used carelessly, it can easily cause dangerous symptoms.</p>
<p>(4) Drug Smoking Cessation Method: This method uses drugs that can relieve withdrawal symptoms or resist nicotine poisoning, such as atropine, magnesium sulfate, organic calcium, bromine, lecithin, etc., to reduce the pain of addiction and achieve the purpose of breaking the addiction.</p>
<p>(5) Spiritual Smoking Cessation Method: Those who abstain without using drugs, relying on their personal determination, the power of faith, or the methods of superstitious gods and doctrines, are all spiritual smoking cessation methods. Doctors often apply spiritual suggestion therapy to those who seek to abstain to reduce the psychology of fear.</p>
<p>In summary, each smoking cessation method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Based on my experience, it is necessary to determine according to the depth of the smoker's nicotine addiction, the strength of the body, the reason for smoking, and the economic ability and environmental situation. However, the most appropriate method is to focus on the gradual reduction method. And give appropriate tonics to assist according to the needs of the body. The cells and tissues of the human body have been constantly supplied with nicotine poison for a long time, and have developed an indispensable habit. Now, if you want to get rid of this habit, it must take a considerable amount of time, so the gradual reduction method is the most reasonable. However, for those who are addicted to smoking due to illness, attention must also be paid to their original illness to avoid recurrence. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<h3>Soliciting Kidney Edema Treatment Requesting Famous Doctors in Shanghai to Provide Effective Prescriptions</h3>
<p>A reader of this newspaper, Mr. Qu Cunpu, wrote: Editor, I am from northern Jiangsu. I recently received a letter from home saying that many people in the countryside have suffered from edema, and both Chinese and Western doctors have given up. Recently, my relative also suffered from this disease, which has been going on for half a year. After a hospital examination, it was said that it was kidney edema. My relative is in her thirties, female, has not had her period for five months, urinates very little, is afraid of cold and vomits, does not know hunger or satiety, has a husky voice, a large abdomen and swollen feet, and is edematous. The edema in the face is particularly severe. At the moment, the edema in her hands and feet has receded, but she is afraid to take medicine, and vomits as soon as she takes it. Because there are no famous doctors in the countryside for treatment, she has not fully recovered. In addition, she cannot come to Shanghai for treatment. I wonder if it is possible to publish this letter in the social service column of your newspaper, so that famous doctors in Shanghai can prescribe the right medicine so that she can buy and take the medicine according to the prescription. If major doctors give effective pills, she will be grateful for more than just my relative alone.</p>
<p>(Note) There are no specialist doctors in the countryside, and patients are suffering deeply! Please famous doctors in Shanghai provide treatment methods for the above symptoms and send them to this newspaper for forwarding, which would be a great merit.</p>
