<h3>冲繩島錯綜複雜綫上　展開爭奪血戰中　日水上特攻隊猛攻敵船團</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　沖繩部戰線日軍，與迫近那霸及首里北方之有力敵重問之戰鬥，日益激烈。十三日晨來，敵軍向經塚，澤氏兩地點及那覇北方之天久地區猛攻，日軍即奮勇應戰，雙方均增强兵力，在錯綜複雜之戰綫，展開爭奪血戰。經塚，澤岻正面之敵兵力﹐爲擁有戰車之步兵約一千五百餘，幸地西南地區，自十三日晨來，有力之數軍部隊來攻西原村及一百五十高地﹐日軍當即勇敢邀擊﹐尤以石嶺東北方日軍，阻礙敵軍前進。小波津以東地區敵軍，亦逐漸逼近日軍陣地，同時日水上特別攻擊隊與陸上部隊之奮戰相呼應，於十二日夜勇敢出動，對嘉手納海面之敵船團加以猛攻，於城邊海面有艦種不詳之敵艦一艘起火。十三日黎明，日方陸上望見嘉手納海面有火柱二條，當為日特攻隊之赫赫戰果。</p>
<p>南西羣島基地十隊繼十四日中央社電　日航空部十三日之後﹐於十四日農復對沖繩本島方面之敵部隊加以猛攻，北　塲附近之火災，現仍未熄。又十三日晨侵犯琉球羣島全綫之敵機僅六架。</p>
<p>南方前錢基地十四日中央社電冲繩本島南部地區之敵軍﹐自九日展開攻勢後，迄今已歷五日﹐今仍繼續熾烈進行中，集中冲繩作戰以來之全部登陸隊兵力，此點頗値重視。敵第二十四軍團之第九十六帥及第二十七師兩師兵力﹐前經日軍猛襲，殆已全軍覆沒，敵乃將慶良間方面之第七十七師及嘉手納方面之海兵隊第一師團移送前方﹐與前之第七師兵力合併﹐以補缺額。最近敵右　前錢，有在名護方面登陸之敵海兵隊第六師參加作戰，敵以四師兵力滿布於東西不足十公里之前方戰綫，採取總攻擊態勢，企圖一決雌雄。日軍守備隊雖於各地稍爲敵軍侵入，然日軍以傳統之邀擊戰術，到處展開決死猛攻，將敵企圖完全粉碎﹐而兩軍數日來展開之攻防戰﹐由大體觀察，似乃決定沖繩作戰之勝負者。十二日晨，敵目前綫反覆來攻日軍右翼﹐前綫將兵乃猛加反攻，確保主要障地﹐其正面敵軍攻擊最爲熾烈﹐澤岻北側高地，十二日以來亦反覆展開激戰。又敵以坦克軍五十輛隨同兵隊，向那　北方進攻，至十二日晚﹐兩軍於連接澤岻與眞嘉比之戰錢上展開激鬥，日軍之猛擊，已獲有偉大戰果。</p>
<h3>襲名古屋敵機　墜毀十七架　日制空部隊邀擊戰果</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電日大本營十四日下午四時發表：　南方基地B29型機約四百架，十四日上午七時許起約歷一不時半，來襲名古歷地區，對市街地區投擲燒夷彈，濫施轟炸，名古屋市內各地發生火災，十二時許以前即告熄滅。　日制空部隊之邀擊，戰果目下正在調查中，迄現在爲止已査明擊落八架，擊毀九架。</p>
<p>京城十四日中央社電朝鮮軍管區司令部十三日下午四時發表如次：敵飛行艇九架﹐於十三日晨九時二十分迄下午三時之間，以一架或數架來襲南朝鮮海面，其中一部曾施攻擊，日方損害輕微。</p>
<p>千餘敵機昨續來襲　東京十四日中央社電　敵機動部隊十三日出規於九州東南方，以艦載機八百架攻擊日本航空基地，至十四日依然盤據於該方面洋上，再以一千數百架自晨起來襲，日航空部隊當於各地邀擊，繼續激烈之戰鬥，同時，日神風特攻隊十日晨亦對敵機動部隊實施猛烈攻擊。</p>
<p>福岡十四日中央社電　十三日拂　於種子島東南方約二百五十公里海面出現之敵機動部隊，以巨人F6F型及「彼特西科爾斯基」型等艦載機，對九州施行波狀襲擊。先以第一編隊約八十架，於上午五時半許，由志布志灣﹐宮峙，延國兩市附近侵入鹿兒島，宮崎，大分縣，至六時半自　摩半島及宮　縣北部逸去。繼第二編隊約一百五十架，於六時半由宮崎附近志布志灣及　麽半島﹐侵入與第一編隊相同之行動地區，於七時半許退去。第三編隊自七時半許至八時半止，約有一百五十架。第四編隊自八時半許﹐約有二十架由豐後水道﹐宮崎北部，志布志　侵入。第五編隊於九時半許約有七十架，由大隅·　摩兩半島及富崎縣東方侵人，大約均於同一方向遁去。又B29型機一架由體後水道侵入佐伯附近﹐又自種子島東去。第六編隊約一百二十架，自十一時二十分起至十二時十分左右，由宮崎南方海面侵入，經宮崎南部及鹿兒島縣南部後遁去。第七編隊約九十架，自十二時三十分至下午二時之間，由大會縣南部，宮崎北部，經態本縣北部後逸去。第八編隊五十架﹐第九編隊一百零五架，第十編隊三十架﹐前後共達九百架。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　十三日拂曉，敵機大規模空嬰九州，乃冲繩開始作戰前三月十八日以來之初次﹐敵機空襲目的，蓋欲制壓日軍九州地區航空基地，以期慶開有利之沖繩決戰。</p>
<p>日邀擊隊猛攻美艦　南西羣島甚地十四日中央社電　敵機動部隊十三日出動艦載機，對九州各航空基地來襲﹐十四日復有大型，小型空母各二三艘，戰艦二艘之敵機動部隊侵入九州東南海域，十四日晨以艦載機反　攻擊九州·中國·四國各地﹐以日邀擊部隊在洋上出擊，對敵空母及戰艦　加以猛攻。</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　大宮島基地來電，尼米資司令部十三日特則公報稱：美艦隊十·十一兩日，於冲　島附近受日機攻擊，大型艦艇一艘及船舶數艘受損。</p>
<h3>東亞地勢不同　日軍决可制勝　軍事評論家觀察</h3>
<p>中央社訊　最近沖繩島戰況，又趨激烈緊張，其原因實由於敵美在沖繩島週圍慘遭損害，毫無進展，急謀打開出路，企圖有所作爲故也。頃據本市軍事評論家觀察，認爲此正日本施展個別擊破敵軍之長機。歐洲方面所謂聯合國致勝之道，由情勢觀察，不外爲消耗龐大物量，根木無戰略戰術可言，如英美亦以此方式，在東亞方面作戰﹐則因地勢上關係，日本決可制勝。同時美總統特魯曼對日本之政策﹐與故總統羅斯福有所不同，且因歐戰歷時頗久，美軍多力竭避戰，尤以輸運補助及經濟上諸問題，故敵美困難頗大，決不可能應付長期戰。</p>
<p>沖繩敵軍迄無進展　沖繩島陸上作戰，在那　之北及首里之北和與那原間之戰事，仍在對峙狀態中。當初敵以四個師團兵力，從事作戰，迄無進展。最近又將在北部之第一六兩師團移往該處，企圖增援，以挽救危局，但仍爲泡影，而犧牲更大，再由於日本之特別攻擊隊猛烈殲擊，遭受嚴重之打擊，因此敵美　急異常，為向日本特攻隊根據地有所　動及企圖計，乃有這駛機動部隊之舉。</p>
<p>敵激動隊實力薄弱　然查該機動部隊實力薄弱﹐僅以航空母　約五或六艘作爲基幹，在目前之英美情形之下，視此機動部隊之組成，已爲最大之武力。同時敵急謀打開另一面出路，竟窺圖九州方面·今在日本方面，對敵方此種企圖﹐實爲個別擊破良機，今後如何，則以最近數日內之狀况，即可加以判斷，總之，敵艦船之損失慘重，根據大本營所發表，冲　週圍之敵艦船，其損失達五百餘艘以上，敵方向對本身損失不願發表，如今亦已多少予以透露﹐故在此戰局　張之際，敵方之發表﹐足見損害慘重，不得再加以隱蔽，茲據敵所發表﹐至本月十一日止之戰死者爲二千六百八十四人，負傷者一萬四千人，但據日本所調查結果，敵兵之死傷者爲三萬六千人。</p>
<p>歐洲戰事物資鬥爭　至歐戰結束下之敵方種種宣傳﹐其流動方向大致如下：敵在歐戰勝之原因，第一，根據　　林元帥向路透社記者所發表之談話，彼所百聯合國之戰勝原因﹕　聯合國作大規模之轟炸，　戰　　之低空攻擊，　對　　民澈底之　炸，　　汽油等燃料不足　德V一V二之新型流量彈﹐猶未有如理想期待之發揮效力。第二，在另外所見之敵宣傳中，其主要者，乃以大量之航空機及有力之坦克車，空挺部隊﹐飛機大量輸運力，以及大規模之巧妙作戰。茲據該軍事專門家以個人觀察，歐戰主要者為物量之門爭，實們戰略及戰術可言。在作戰之前綫上，敵以多量之兵力，航空機，坦克車﹐　大推進，以決定制勝。第三，再根據　　林元帥所述﹐此次德失敗原因，為敵向德民衆之　炸，尤其向德國民　殺之行爲。</p>
<p>東亞歐洲地勢不同　此外尙有一種宣傳稱，英美將以歐洲兵力，移赴大東亞戰綫，惟在經過相當時期之後，並非為不可能。但我人明瞭東亞之地勢與歐洲不同，且有海面頗多，敵以空軍航空部隊運用，必須有相當之基地與燃料武器之配備，單以衆多之飛機決不適用。一面在沖繩島上，敵已遭受嚴重打擊，故我深信日本確有戰勝之把握。</p>
<p>又目前德艦隊之情形，根據敵方所發表之德國剩餘艦隊力量，爲巡洋艦二艘﹐驅逐艦十三艘﹐潛水艇三百艘，商船十六萬噸，及高速度之魚雷艇。其間僅巡洋艦二艘投降，其他　　行動﹐敵方竭力以無綫電勸告攘艦隊降服﹐茲德大部份潛水艇仍在北海﹐英本土之北西南方﹐及英法海峽作繼續之活動﹐故敵之運　深感困難。雖稱一部份潛艇能赴東洋﹐惟因燃料上之種種關係﹐難於實現。</p>
<p>英美蘇聯協力困難　波隔問題，英·美·蘇三國仍堅持不　，今後當有所發展。據本月十二日舊金山廣播，據華盛頓電稱，史太林已拒絕特魯曼邱吉爾之耍求妥協。又據本月十二日華盛頓電稱：美國務長官代理格魯﹐在會見新聞記者時所言稱：史太林元帥已通告﹐蘇聯對西方諸同盟國已無協力之餘地。惟在新聞報道上，則無此確實之記載，故此類表明，在其背面，定有頗大之問題。</p>
<p>特氏了解日本民族　最近美國B29型機之主要集中在馬里亞納方面，其攻擊重點，目前行動向日本本土騷擾外，其他任務極少·再過去美國羅斯福總統在世時，採取「消滅日本」之謀路略，在當今特魯曼總統之目的，由於其對日本民族有所瞭解，一反過去方針﹐尤其歐戰之結束﹐其間歷時達五年之久﹐在大東亞戰爭上頗惑困難，再因運輸補助及經濟上決難爭取長期戰，而日本決不中其謀略。又舊金山會議暗礁重重，蘇代表莫洛托夫，英代表艾登，渝代表宋子文均缺席會議﹐且宋子文頗受美國冷待。總之，該代表之缺席，恐在將來之世界政治上﹐又有頗大之變化。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>儲糧與蓄水</h3>
<p>近來由於國際戰局的變化﹐上海一部份市民不無樂觀的空想，也許認爲上海將不受戰事波及了，這種不顧現實的非分之想，足以鬆弛對於戰時的警覺﹐其結果對於本身是非常危險的。就整個戰局而言﹐歐洲戰爭雖告結束，但東亞戰局與歐戰早已失却聯繫性，不懂不因歐戰結束而緩和，且將益趨緊張。我們固然不必妄測未來戰爭在何方面推進，可是，我們身處戰時重要都市的上海市民﹐只有提高對於戰爭的警覺性，而作種種必要的準備﹐才是與戰局與本身有利﹐並可因此減少可能遭遇的痛苦與損害。</p>
<p>所以，上海市民今天所應注意的，在於認識戰局的現實性，而準備防患未然之計。如果徒作樂觀空想﹐結果事變之來，出於會卒﹐不但空想成爲泡影，而慌張無措，徒遭損害。因之，與其樂觀空想﹐不如有備無患。</p>
<p>我們認爲目前最須準備者，爲儲糧與蓄水兩事，爰就所見﹐申述如次：</p>
<p>戰爭形勢緊張，或空襲頻繁，均可促成交通阻塞現象，全市入於警戒狀熊，屆時最成問題者，厥爲糧食。上海的糧食，在平時已完全仰求四鄉，一且交通阻塞，糧食來源斷絕﹐勢非依賴原有存糧不可有兩個月消費之儲存量﹐以防萬一。假定以一保或一甲爲單位，統計本甲或本保以內之總人數，設定應儲備若干糧食。以所應儲備之糧食集中一處或分置二三處。儲糧處所，即就本甲或本保以內之空屋借用。是項儲糧，作爲本甲或本保各戶公，凡該保甲之各戶均有善意保護之義糧食種類，自不限於米毅，大部分可糧充之。</p>
<p>至於採辦與分担用款方面，最好由市府主持其專﹐利用保甲組織，上下推動·首由市府組織採購委員會，負責採辦。另組分配委員會，由各總聯保長担任委員，其下每一聯保設置分會，由聯保長及保長組織之。糧食價款，原則上依照各戶人數平均分攤，惟若干貧苦之家，確無負担能力者﹐應由同一單位內較爲殷富者酌爲補助，並由市府另籌補足。</p>
<p>自來水在戰爭及空襲之際，極易發生毀損﹐因而斷水。爲補救之計，惟有廣置自流井。過去本市各保甲區原已推動掘井，但無整個計劃，地城分配旣無標準，掘井技術與式樣亦不一致，引起各方面聚議。我們主張應耶由保甲當局主持，規訂整個計劃，利用保甲組織﹐推進掘井運動。凡若干戶應掘井一方，掘井技術及方式亦應釐訂一致，切合實際應用。承包掘井工程者須經建設局認可，工程完畢亦須由建設局技術人員騐收，以示負責。</p>
<h3>日地方長官開會　鈴木首相親致訓　勉以不動信念完遂戰爭</h3>

<p>東京十四日中央社電　日鈴木首相十四日在地方長官會議席上致詞，說明德國投降後日本作戰“的毫無變化，並要求各地方長官根據自存自衛之不動信念，具體顯現日本之戰意，並希望各地方長官與國民共同努力，此爲行政之要　。鈴木首相又稱：彼於兒童時代　十八史略，見元朝名宰相耶律　材所云「興一利不如除一害」之句﹐當時不明其意何指，但在今日，此實可視爲金玉良言，顧各位深體此言。此次迅速組織國民義勇隊﹐乃爲以國民之愛國熱忱爲動力之國民組織，並爲一實踐運動，於軍當局指導下，形成爲防衛本土之戰鬥熊勢，但吾國民仍應各守職責，充分發揮奉公之熱忱，此為吾人應注意者，尚祈各地方長官克服任何困難﹐毅然完成戰責﹐向完遂戰爭之途　　。</p>

<h3>嘉定現况</h3>
<p>— 志澄</p>
<p>沿革略述</p>
<p>嘉定縣爲　　地﹐元朝改爲嘉定州，迨明　降　縣，屬蘇州府，淸屬鎭﹐六十二鄉，保甲戶口﹐據最近統計﹐則爲五百册六保，五千二百二十六甲，五萬三千〇八十九戶，人口總數爲二十二萬一千〇八百五十七人。縣城沿橫瀝，入口僅三萬五千六百五十一人，佔總　百分之十六。</p>
<p>古跡文化</p>
<p>嘉定交化，自漢晋以來，豪俠文人，代有輩出。記者在城內僅勾留一日，在市　上進了一次﹐見節孝牌坊，不下三四處。近城南門，有孔廟一　常，本縣義士，侯黃二先生，集義兵與抗，堅守城坦，歷二旬餘﹐以外接不至，城遂破﹐二先生率家屬卒殉節矣。文人以淸代論，經學家之巨子，如錢大昕，史學家巨子，如王鳴盛等。詩書畫家，人才輩出。亦爲特色·事變前，學校林立，教育發達，全縣中小學，有三百校之　；今者僅有百校校已﹐內有縣立中學一校，私立中學三校，縣立小學二十四校﹐私立小學七十餘校。人數不過一萬，學生程度﹐因受家庭，環境﹐生活，及師資等之影響，每况愈下，不堪回首，當局以經費支絀，難有救濟辦法。</p>
<p>農田生活</p>
<p>農產物以棉·米為大宗，全縣田畝有「棉七稻三」之稱，即盡量耕　，所得米量，亦不敷供給嘉定全部人民之食糧，故食米全仰常熟，崑山﹐太倉等一帶輸入。今年早稻收成尚佳，晚稻及蔬菜等，因受去年寒冰之災﹐大受影響，收成堪慮。</p>
<p>田租分水·旱兩種﹐即稻田與棉田是也；去歲稻田每畝四斗，棉田每畝三千五百元﹐目前田價約値二十萬至四十萬一畝﹐視田之優劣而定。田担約値三萬元·故棉農以現在棉，稻二種田賦，其差額過鉅，殊不平等﹐曾呈請縣府當局，對於棉農田賦﹐亦以米一斗計，惟至今仍未解次。</p>
<p>嘉定人民，大都依農爲生，其次爲手工業﹐以黃草工業及刻竹工業爲著名。黃草工集集於東鄉澄橋及徐行鎭一帶，工人約有萬餘，出品有提包﹐拖鞋等﹐銷售江浙各地。竹刻工業，始於明季，至淸乾隆間而最盛，出品有文具，日用品，玩賞品等，以精　見稱於世，現受戰事影響﹐銷路減少，漸被淘汰；此外尚有棉織品，（如棉布，毛巾）酒類及薄荷等，亦有輸出者。</p>
<p>本地物價，亦與上海情形相似﹐即不斷作週期性上漲。如食米一項，因仰給於他鄉，至五月六日價十一萬左右，其他如魚·肉·蛋·蔬菜等之價格，亦與滬地不相上下。</p>
<p>治安建設</p>
<p>嘉定治安頗爲平靖，地方上除駐有警察　百餘名，及保安隊中隊外，尚有日方警備隊，協力維持；故尚無重大事故發生。至於建設方面，爲適應戰時之需要，如公路橋　之修理，以利運輸；工商業之登記，以改進管理，設立示範晨塲﹐提倡改良種子，以資增產·自衛團之組織，及强化保甲等﹐皆在兼程推進辦理之中。</p>
<p>棉產改進</p>
<p>為適應戰時之需要，中日兩國當局，遂努力開發華中棉產﹐設立華中棉產改進會；其宗旨爲開發華中棉花﹐先以增產爲王，對於品種改良﹐亦圖　速達成之。關於優良品種之育成﹐充分尊重其從來之經騐而活用之，至於陸地棉，則進行研究，以收改良</p>
<p>嘉定起先僅設辦事處，隸上海分會下，最近因成績最好，故擴充範圍﹐改辦事處爲分會矣。本地棉花質地較差，僅可紡十六支紗；由改進而產之金字棉及德字棉﹐可紡二十四至二十八支紗。在成立之初，本縣在東門外有試種塲一百五十畝，鄉民之特約採種面三千畝，經技師及技術員之實地指導，並在播種期間，召開講話會﹐講解播種技術及原因及棉花展覽會之舉行等之奴力·現各鄉之採種團已有二萬四千畝左右，去年產量，每畝可得一百五十斤。依過去情形論而﹐面積逐年在增加中，故組織方面，亦加擴充，自去年始，已在南翔·馬陸·徐行等各鄉，設立辦事處及駐在所。</p>
<p>對於棉農有平價物品配給，如肥田粉及菜十餅等﹔且對棉田之種植或績，擇其優良者而褒賞之，有表彰狀及現金等。</p>
<p>合作事業</p>
<p>嘉定合作支社，係「行政院合作事業委員會」管　，成立於三十二年七月﹐目前共有社負三萬餘人。社內資金一百五十餘萬元﹐在必需時，可向當地銀行方面籌借·社員規定繳納資金，每戶五十元，現任社長爲楊籌谷﹐（前任靑浦縣長，）民處事精明﹐對困難繁復之社務﹐在縣府協助之</p>
<p>社員中十分之八爲農民，餘則爲當地居民，對合作事業缺乏認識·鄉民本希望加入後，可得廉價之配給物品，事實上，因資金較少，尤以物價步漲不已，採辦物品，殊感困難·當局有鑒於此，命增資金，每戶納五百﹐唯鄉民加入後，不能如願以償，頗感失望﹐故對增資一事﹐始終未成事</p>
<p>自去年度四月份起，規定嘉定·崇明·寶山·申江等爲農業增產區後。該社另設農業科，注重農村生產，技術主任爲趙兼金，技術員十一人，均上海大學訓練者，經騐豐富。在城東門外，有示範農塲﹐佔地五十畝左右，從事改良種子；更有特約農塲二﹐在西門外六里﹐近奉當局命，着自組工廠﹐以生產火柴·棉紗·土布等物。作爲康價配給農民之用。</p>
<p>關於農村貸金，曾向交通銀行接洽過，因手續麻煩，又以貸出數量，在三萬元左右，對農民方面，無濟於事，如每頭牛價在一百萬元以上，故未作更進一步之接洽。</p>
<p>交通概况</p>
<p>地形平坦，河流四達。主要河流北有太倉界之瀏河，南有靑浦界之吳淞江，皆自西向東。　通二河間之河道多條，其比較重要者，有橫　自陸渡橋經縣城至南翔。鹽鐵塘經外岡·方泰，均作西北東南流向。另有謝　塘興瀏河並行，目外岡經縣城至寳山之羅店·此等河道，均有航運之利。</p>
<p>陸路交通有京滬鐵路橫過南境，設南翔黃渡安亭站；公路自縣滅通寶山，羅店之寶羅路及羅嘉路。與上海相通者﹐有滬太路﹐本路自上海閘化至瀏河，途經裹定南翔等地﹐全路長三十七公里，築有六公尺寬之煤悄路面，事變後路面情形惡劣，公路橋梁面，事變後路面情形惡劣，公路橋梁毀壞者甚多，行車困難，遇橋尤須下車步行，自建設局興修以來，已略見轉好，但車載過重者仍苦之。目下行駛此路者，有華中長途汽車公司，及其他民營運輸公司，均以上海為出發點，票價目五千元至七千元不等。小輪航路，有屜翔至縣城，又自上海至蘇州通小稐，亦經黃渡安亭等站。</p>

<h3>Intense Battle on the Intricate Lines of Okinawa Island; Japanese Water Special Attack Force Fiercely Attacks Enemy Convoy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese army on the Okinawa front is engaged in increasingly fierce battles with powerful enemy forces pressing towards Naha and the north of Shuri. From the morning of the 13th, the enemy launched intense attacks on the areas of Kyozuka, Zaha, and the Ameku district north of Naha. The Japanese army immediately fought bravely in response, with both sides reinforcing their forces, and engaged in bloody battles for control on the intricate front lines. The enemy force facing Kyozuka and Zaha consists of approximately 1,500 infantry with tanks. In the southwest area of Koji, from the morning of the 13th, powerful enemy units attacked Nishihara Village and Height 150. The Japanese army bravely engaged them, especially the Japanese troops northeast of Ishimine, who obstructed the enemy's advance. In the area east of Kobazu, the enemy is gradually closing in on the Japanese positions. Simultaneously, the Japanese Water Special Attack Force, in coordination with the fierce battles of the ground forces, bravely launched an attack on the enemy convoy off Kadena on the night of the 12th, setting fire to an enemy ship of unknown type off the coast of Gusukube. At dawn on the 13th, Japanese ground forces observed two pillars of fire off Kadena, which is believed to be a glorious result of the Japanese Special Attack Force.</p>
<p>Nansei Islands Base, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Following the 13th, the Japanese air force launched fierce attacks on enemy units on Okinawa Island on the 14th. The fires near Kitatama are still not extinguished. Furthermore, only six enemy planes intruded on the entire line of the Ryukyu Islands on the morning of the 13th.</p>
<p>Southern Frontline Base, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy forces in the southern region of Okinawa Island, after launching their offensive on the 9th, have been engaged in intense fighting for five days, concentrating all the landing force strength since the start of the Okinawa operation, which is a point worth noting. The enemy's 96th Division and 27th Division of the 24th Army Corps, having been heavily attacked by the Japanese army, have been almost completely annihilated. The enemy has therefore transferred the 77th Division from the Kerama area and the 1st Marine Division from the Kadena area to the front lines, combining them with the previously deployed 7th Division to fill the gaps. Recently, the enemy's 6th Marine Division, which landed in the Nago area, has joined the battle on the right front. The enemy has deployed four divisions along the front line, which is less than ten kilometers from east to west, adopting a total attack posture, attempting to decide the outcome. Although the Japanese garrison forces have been slightly infiltrated by the enemy in various locations, the Japanese army is employing traditional ambush tactics, launching desperate attacks everywhere, completely shattering the enemy's plans. The offensive and defensive battles that the two armies have been engaged in for several days appear, from a general observation, to be determining the victory or defeat of the Okinawa operation. On the morning of the 12th, the enemy repeatedly attacked the right flank of the Japanese army on the current front line. The soldiers on the front line fiercely counterattacked, securing key defensive positions. The enemy's attacks on the front were most intense. The highlands north of Zaha have also seen repeated fierce battles since the 12th. Furthermore, the enemy, with 50 tanks accompanying the troops, advanced north of Naha. By the evening of the 12th, the two armies were engaged in fierce fighting on the battle line connecting Zaha and Makabi. The Japanese army's fierce attacks have achieved great results.</p>
<h3>17 Enemy Planes Attacking Nagoya Shot Down; Japanese Air Defense Units Achieve Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 14th: Approximately 400 B-29 type planes from a southern base attacked the Nagoya area from around 7:00 AM on the 14th for about an hour and a half, dropping incendiary bombs on the city area and conducting indiscriminate bombing. Fires broke out in various parts of Nagoya City, but were extinguished by around 12:00 PM. The results of the Japanese air defense unit's interception are currently under investigation. So far, it has been confirmed that eight planes have been shot down and nine planes have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Keijo (Seoul), 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Korean Military District Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 13th as follows: Nine enemy flying boats attacked the South Korean coast between 9:20 AM and 3:00 PM on the 13th, with one or several planes at a time. Some of them launched attacks, causing minor damage to the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Enemy Planes Continue to Attack Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - An enemy mobile force appeared southeast of Kyushu on the 13th, and 800 carrier-based planes attacked Japanese air bases. As of the 14th, it still occupied the ocean in that area, and launched another 1,000+ planes to attack since morning. The Japanese air force intercepted them in various locations, continuing the fierce battle. At the same time, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force also launched fierce attacks on the enemy mobile force on the morning of the 10th.</p>
<p>Fukuoka, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy mobile force that appeared approximately 250 kilometers southeast of Tanegashima at dawn on the 13th used carrier-based planes such as the Grumman F6F and the Vought F4U Corsair to carry out wave-like attacks on Kyushu. The first formation, approximately 80 planes, intruded from Shibushi Bay, near Miyakonojo and Enokoku, into Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Oita prefectures around 5:30 AM, and retreated from the Satsuma Peninsula and northern Miyazaki Prefecture by 6:30 AM. The second formation, approximately 150 planes, intruded from Shibushi Bay and the Satsuma Peninsula near Miyazaki around 6:30 AM, into the same area of operation as the first formation, and retreated around 7:30 AM. The third formation consisted of approximately 150 planes from around 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM. The fourth formation, approximately 20 planes, intruded from the Bungo Channel, northern Miyazaki, and Shibushi around 8:30 AM. The fifth formation, approximately 70 planes, intruded from the Osumi and Satsuma Peninsulas and the east of Miyazaki Prefecture around 9:30 AM, and generally retreated in the same direction. Furthermore, one B-29 type plane intruded into the vicinity of Saiki from the Bungo Channel, and then headed east from Tanegashima. The sixth formation, approximately 120 planes, intruded from the sea south of Miyazaki from 11:20 AM to around 12:10 PM, and retreated after passing through southern Miyazaki and southern Kagoshima Prefecture. The seventh formation, approximately 90 planes, passed through southern Oita Prefecture, northern Miyazaki, and then northern Kumamoto Prefecture between 12:30 PM and 2:00 PM in the afternoon and retreated. The eighth formation consisted of 50 planes, the ninth formation 105 planes, and the tenth formation 30 planes, totaling 900 planes before and after.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The large-scale enemy air raid on Kyushu at dawn on the 13th was the first since March 18th, three months before the start of the Okinawa operation. The purpose of the enemy air raid was to suppress Japanese air bases in the Kyushu region, in order to open up a favorable decisive battle on Okinawa.</p>
<h3>Japanese Interception Units Fiercely Attack American Ships</h3>
<p>Nansei Islands Base, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy mobile force dispatched carrier-based planes on the 13th to attack various air bases in Kyushu. On the 14th, an enemy mobile force consisting of two or three large and small aircraft carriers each and two battleships intruded into the southeast sea area of Kyushu. On the morning of the 14th, the aircraft carriers retaliated by attacking various locations in Kyushu, China, and Shikoku. The Japanese interception units launched an attack on the enemy aircraft carriers and battleships at sea.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A dispatch from the Omijima Base states that Admiral Nimitz's headquarters issued a special communique on the 13th, stating: American fleets were attacked by Japanese planes near Okinawa Island on the 10th and 11th, resulting in damage to one large warship and several ships.</p>
<h3>Military Commentator Observes: Eastern Asia's Terrain is Different; Japan Can Definitely Win</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - The recent situation on Okinawa Island has become more intense and strained. The reason for this is that the American enemy has suffered severe damage around Okinawa Island and made no progress, so they are urgently seeking a way out and attempting to take action. According to observations by military commentators in this city, this is precisely the long suit of Japan, which is to defeat the enemy's forces individually. The European aspect of what is so-called the United Nations victory route, from the perspective of the situation, is nothing more than the consumption of vast amounts of material. There is no strategy or tactics to speak of. If Britain and the United States also use this method to fight in the East Asian region, then, due to the relationship of terrain, Japan can definitely win. At the same time, US President Truman's policy towards Japan is different from that of the late President Roosevelt. Moreover, due to the long duration of the European war, many American troops are exhausted and avoid fighting, especially due to problems with transportation subsidies and the economy, the American enemy faces great difficulties and will definitely not be able to cope with a long-term war.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces on Okinawa Making No Progress</h3>
<p>The ground battles on Okinawa Island, in the area north of Naha and north of Shuri, and in the area between Shuri and Yonabaru, are still in a state of confrontation. Initially, the enemy used four divisions to engage in combat, but made no progress. Recently, the 16th and 2nd divisions in the north were transferred there in an attempt to reinforce and salvage the dangerous situation, but this was still a pipe dream, and the sacrifices were even greater. Furthermore, due to the fierce annihilation by the Japanese Special Attack Force, they suffered serious blows, so the American enemy became unusually anxious and, in order to take action against the bases of the Japanese Special Attack Force and attempt to make plans, they carried out this maneuver of dispatching a mobile force.</p>
<h3>Enemy Mobile Force's Strength is Weak</h3>
<p>However, after investigating, the strength of the mobile force is weak. It is based only on about five or six aircraft carriers. Under the current circumstances of Britain and the United States, the composition of this mobile force has already created their greatest military force. At the same time, the enemy is urgently seeking another way out, even trying to take a peek at the Kyushu area. Now, on the Japanese side, this kind of attempt by the enemy is truly a good opportunity for individual defeat. What will happen in the future can be judged based on the situation in the last few days. In short, the losses of enemy warships are heavy. According to what Imperial Headquarters has announced, the losses of enemy warships around Okinawa have reached more than 500. The enemy side is unwilling to announce its own losses, but now it has already revealed some of them. Therefore, at this tense moment in the battle, the enemy's announcement shows that the damage is severe and can no longer be concealed. According to what the enemy announced, as of the 11th of this month, the number of battle deaths was 2,684 and the number of wounded was 14,000, but according to the results of the Japanese investigation, the number of enemy soldiers killed and wounded was 36,000.</p>
<h3>European War is a Struggle for Materials</h3>
<p>As for the enemy's various propaganda after the end of the European war, the direction of the flow is roughly as follows: The enemy's victory in the European war was due to, first, according to Marshal Zhukov's interview with a Reuters reporter, the reasons for the United Nations' victory: the United Nations' large-scale bombing, the low-altitude attacks of the combat aircraft, the thorough bombing of the German people, and the fact that they lacked gasoline and other fuel. Germany's V-1 and V-2 new type of guided missile did not exert the effectiveness expected from them. Second, in other enemy propaganda, the main ones are massive numbers of aircraft and powerful tanks, airborne troops, large-scale airlift capacity, and ingenious large-scale operations. According to the personal observation of this military expert, the main aspect of the European war was a struggle over the quantity of materials; there were really no strategies or tactics to speak of. On the battlefront, the enemy used large numbers of troops, aircraft, and tanks to advance greatly in order to decide the victory. Third, according to Marshal Zhukov again, the reasons for Germany's failure this time were the enemy's bombing of the German people, especially the acts of killing German civilians.</p>
<h3>Eastern Asia and Europe Have Different Terrains</h3>
<p>In addition, there is another type of propaganda that claims that Britain and the United States will transfer European forces to the Greater East Asia battle line, but this is not impossible after a considerable period of time. However, we know that the terrain of East Asia is different from that of Europe, and there are many sea areas. The enemy must have corresponding bases and supplies of fuel and weapons in order to operate with its air force, so large numbers of aircraft alone are not applicable. On the one hand, the enemy has suffered serious blows on Okinawa Island, so we deeply believe that Japan definitely has the confidence to win.</p>
<p>Also, the current situation of the German fleet, according to what the enemy has announced, the remaining strength of the German fleet is two cruisers, thirteen destroyers, three hundred submarines, 160,000 tons of merchant ships, and high-speed torpedo boats. Among them, only two cruisers surrendered. For other operations, the enemy has been doing everything it can to advise the remaining fleet to surrender via radio. The majority of German submarines are still continuing operations in the North Sea, north, southwest of the British Isles, and the English Channel, so the enemy's transport is deeply in trouble. Although it is said that a part of the submarines can go to East Asia, it is difficult to realize due to various fuel-related reasons.</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union is Difficult</h3>
<p>The Polish question, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are still insisting on not giving in, so there will be developments in the future. According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 12th of this month, according to a Washington dispatch, Stalin has refused Truman and Churchill's request for a compromise. Also, according to a Washington dispatch on the 12th of this month: US Under Secretary of State Grew said when meeting with reporters: Marshal Stalin has notified that the Soviet Union has no spare energy to cooperate with the Western Allied countries. However, there is no definite record of this kind in news reports, so behind these types of statements, there must be considerable problems.</p>
<h3>Truman Understands the Japanese Nation</h3>
<p>Recently, the main concentration of American B-29 type planes has been in the Mariana Islands. Their attack focus, at present, is to conduct harassment operations against the Japanese mainland, and they have very few other missions. Furthermore, when the late American President Roosevelt was alive, he adopted a strategy of "eliminating Japan." The purpose of the current President Truman is that, because he understands the Japanese nation, he has reversed the past policy. In particular, the end of the European war, which lasted five years, is quite difficult for the Greater East Asia War. In addition, it is definitely difficult to win a long-term war due to transportation subsidies and the economy, and Japan will definitely not fall for his strategy. Moreover, the San Francisco conference is fraught with hidden dangers. The Soviet representative Molotov, the British representative Eden, and the Chongqing representative Song Ziwen were all absent from the conference, and Song Ziwen received cold treatment from the United States. In short, the absence of these representatives may bring about major changes in future world politics.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Storing Food and Conserving Water</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the changes in the international war situation, some citizens of Shanghai have not been without optimistic fantasies, perhaps thinking that Shanghai will not be affected by the war. This kind of unrealistic, unwarranted thought is enough to relax vigilance regarding wartime, and the result is very dangerous for oneself. In terms of the entire war situation, although the European war has ended, the East Asian war situation has long lost its connection with the European war and will not ease due to the end of the European war, but will become more tense. We certainly don't need to speculate wildly on which aspects of the war will advance in the future, but as Shanghai citizens living in an important wartime city, only by raising our awareness of the war and making various necessary preparations can we benefit both the war situation and ourselves, and thereby reduce the pain and damage that may be encountered.</p>
<p>Therefore, what Shanghai citizens should pay attention to today is to recognize the reality of the war situation and prepare for contingencies. If one only indulges in optimistic fantasies, the result will be that when the unexpected occurs, one will not only find one's fantasies shattered, but one will also panic and suffer damage in vain. Therefore, rather than being optimistic and fantasizing, it is better to be prepared for any eventuality.</p>
<p>We believe that the most important things to prepare for at present are storing food and conserving water, and we will elaborate on our views below:</p>
<p>A tense war situation, or frequent air raids, can both lead to traffic congestion. When the whole city enters a state of alert, the biggest problem will be food. Shanghai's food has always relied entirely on the surrounding countryside. Once traffic is blocked and the food supply is cut off, it will be necessary to rely on existing reserves. It is necessary to have a reserve of two months' worth of consumption to guard against emergencies. Assuming that a bao or a jia is taken as a unit, the total number of people within this jia or this bao should be counted, and the amount of food that should be stored should be set. The food that should be stored should be concentrated in one place or placed in two or three places. The storage location should be a vacant house within the jia or bao that is borrowed. This storage should be public for all households in the jia or bao, and all households in that bao jia have a duty to protect it. The types of food are not limited to rice, and most can be used to supplement grains.</p>
<p>As for purchasing and sharing the expenses, it is best for the municipal government to preside over it and use the baojia organization to promote it from top to bottom. First, the municipal government should organize a purchasing committee to be responsible for purchasing. Another allocation committee should be formed, with the heads of each general joint bao serving as members. Under them, each joint bao should set up a branch, organized by the joint bao head and bao heads. In principle, the price of food should be divided equally according to the number of people in each household, but in the case of some poor families who are truly unable to bear the burden, the richer ones within the same unit should provide a small amount of assistance, and the municipal government should raise additional funds to make up for the difference.</p>
<p>Tap water is very prone to damage during wars and air raids, resulting in water outages. The only remedy for this is to widely install artesian wells. In the past, various baojia districts in this city have already promoted well digging, but there was no overall plan. The allocation of land and the standards for digging techniques and styles were not consistent, causing discussions in various quarters. We propose that the baojia authorities should take charge, formulate an overall plan, and use the baojia organization to promote the well-digging movement. A certain number of households should dig a well on one side, and the digging techniques and methods should also be standardized and practical. Those who contract to dig wells must be approved by the Construction Bureau, and the completion of the project must also be inspected and accepted by the technical personnel of the Construction Bureau to show responsibility.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Japanese Local Officials; Prime Minister Suzuki Personally Gives Instructions; Encourages Them to Complete the War with Unwavering Belief</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The first meeting of local officials since the establishment of the Suzuki Cabinet was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 8:00 AM on the 14th.

<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Prime Minister Suzuki said on the 14th at the meeting of local officials that there has been "no change in Japan's operations" after Germany's surrender, and he requested that local officials specifically manifest Japan's war will based on the unwavering belief of self-preservation and self-defense. He also hoped that local officials would work together with the people, which is "the essence of administration." Prime Minister Suzuki also said that he had read The Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance as a child and saw the sentence by the Yuan Dynasty's famous chancellor Yelü Chucai, "Benefiting one thing is not as good as eliminating one harm." At the time, he did not understand what it meant, but today, it can truly be regarded as golden words. "The rapid organization of the National Volunteer Corps is a national organization that uses the people's patriotic zeal as its driving force, and is a practical movement. Under the guidance of the military authorities, it will form a fighting posture for defending the homeland. However, our people should still each guard their posts and fully display their devotion to public service. This is what we should pay attention to. I hope that local officials will overcome any difficulties, resolutely complete their war responsibilities, and move towards the path of completing the war."</p>

<h3>Chongqing Representatives Oppose Exclusive Colonial Domain, Five Nations Form Opposition</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency telegram) - San Francisco dispatch: The United Kingdom, hoping that the Soviet Union and the United States would each propose different amendments regarding the international trusteeship system, also released its proposal on the 12th. Chongqing's proposal, in its form, is very similar to that of the United States. However, it protests the exclusive management rights of the colonies or bases of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. This point is similar to the Soviet proposal. Regarding the base issue, a clear state of opposition already exists between the Soviet Union, Chongqing, and the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The main content of Chongqing's proposal is as follows: Divide non-independent territories into two types: strategic areas and non-strategic areas. Strategic areas are managed by the Security Council, and non-strategic areas are managed by the General Assembly. The U.S. proposal once requested that the authorities managing strategic areas submit reports according to the reporting format stipulated by the Trusteeship Council, while Chongqing's proposal requires the authorities managing security-protected areas to submit reports to the Security Council according to the reporting format stipulated by the Security Council. The scope of managed areas stipulated to ensure world security should be limited to the minimum area necessary for defense or security.</p>

<h3>Cooperative Enterprise Committee Formulates Locust Control Measures, Nymphs Discovered in Yao Hua Township, a Suburb of Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Cooperative Enterprise Committee of the Executive Yuan, alarmed by the discovery of locust plagues in Yao Hua Township, a suburb of Nanjing, has specially formulated temporary locust control measures and telegraphed orders to cooperative societies in various places to immediately implement them. It is also issuing notices to mutual aid societies to investigate whether there are locust plagues or migratory locusts in their localities and nearby areas. If any are discovered, they should be reported immediately to their respective branch offices to urgently plan control measures. When locust plagues are discovered, each branch office should quickly supervise members and farmers to thoroughly cooperate in exterminating them to prevent them from spreading. In areas where locust plagues are more severe, each branch office should consider providing members and farmers with locust control equipment or offering prices to purchase locust carcasses as an incentive. When each branch office is carrying out locust control, it should maintain close contact with local administrative organs in order to achieve cooperative control effects.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Executive Yuan's Food Increase Promotion Committee, due to the discovery of nymphs in the countryside near Yao Hua Township, a suburb of Nanjing, a few days ago, convened relevant agencies to discuss effective sealing measures. Yesterday, Secretary-General Huang Zhao of the committee, together with representatives from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Cooperative Committee, the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, the Rural Construction Committee, and allied agencies, went to Majiachong area north of Yao Huamen Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway to inspect the situation. Many nymphs were found within the wheat fields in that area, and there were also small nymphs on the barren land. Many were found in the soil. Inspections were conducted in various places south of the railway line where damage was reported, and it was estimated that several hundred acres of fields had been affected. The farmers were immediately instructed to widen and deepen the existing field ditches, fill them with water, and drip kerosene on the water surface to prevent the invasion of young nymphs. The young nymphs immediately died upon contact with the kerosene. Currently, the Agricultural Policy Committee is working with relevant agencies to discuss and implement extermination measures. Fearing that similar insect pests will occur in farmland throughout the country, the committee has already urged prompt capture and killing of any locusts or nymphs to prevent them from spreading.</p>

<h3>Current Situation in Jiading</h3>
<p>— Zhi Cheng</p>
<p>Brief Overview of History</p>
<p>Jiading County was [a location]. In the Yuan Dynasty, it was changed to Jiading Prefecture, and in the Ming Dynasty, it was demoted to a county under Suzhou Prefecture. In the Qing Dynasty, it belonged to Zhen, with 62 townships. According to recent statistics on the Baojia system, there are 500 books, 6 Bao, 5,226 Jia, 53,089 households, and a total population of 221,0857. The county seat has only 35,651 residents, accounting for 16% of the total.</p>
<p>Historical Sites and Culture</p>
<p>Since the Han and Jin dynasties, Jiading's culture has produced many heroic figures and literati. The reporter only stayed in the city for one day and went to the market once, seeing no less than three or four memorial arches for women of chastity and filial piety. Near the south gate of the city, there is a Confucian temple. Two righteous men from this county, Mr. Hou and Mr. Huang, gathered righteous soldiers to resist the enemy and firmly defended the city walls for more than 20 days. Due to lack of outside reinforcements, the city was breached, and the two gentlemen led their families to their deaths. Regarding literati, in the Qing Dynasty, giants of Confucian classics, such as Qian Daxin, and giants of historiography, such as Wang Mingsheng, emerged. Talented people in poetry, calligraphy, and painting emerged in large numbers, which is also a characteristic. Before the incident, schools were abundant and education was developed. There were 300 schools of all levels in the county; now there are only 100 schools, including one county-run middle school, three private middle schools, 24 county-run primary schools, and more than 70 private primary schools. The number of students is only over 10,000. Students' levels are deteriorating due to the influence of family, environment, life, and teachers. It is unbearable to look back on. The authorities have difficulty finding relief measures due to financial constraints.</p>
<p>Farmland Life</p>
<p>The main agricultural products are cotton and rice. The county's fields are known as "70% cotton, 30% rice". Even with maximized cultivation, the amount of rice obtained is not enough to supply the food for all the people of Jiading, so rice is entirely imported from Changshu, Kunshan, Taicang, and other areas. The early rice harvest this year is still good, but the late rice and vegetables have been greatly affected by last year's frost disaster, and the harvest is worrying.</p>
<p>Field rent is divided into two types: wet and dry, i.e., rice fields and cotton fields. Last year, rice fields were four dou per mu, and cotton fields were 3,500 yuan per mu. The current price of a field is about 200,000 to 400,000 yuan per mu, depending on the quality of the field. A field burden is about 30,000 yuan. Therefore, cotton farmers believe that the difference between the current cotton and rice field taxes is too large and unfair. They have petitioned the county government to calculate the cotton field tax at one dou of rice as well, but so far it has not been resolved.</p>
<p>The people of Jiading mostly rely on agriculture for a living, followed by handicrafts, with yellow grass industry and bamboo carving industry being famous. The yellow grass industry is concentrated in the Chenggiao and Xuhang towns in the eastern countryside, with about 10,000 workers. The products include handbags, slippers, etc., which are sold throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The bamboo carving industry started in the late Ming Dynasty and reached its peak during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. The products include stationery, daily necessities, and ornamental items, which are known to the world for their exquisite craftsmanship. Currently, it is being gradually eliminated due to reduced sales affected by the war. In addition, there are also cotton textiles (such as cotton cloth, towels), liquor, and mint, etc., which are also exported.</p>
<p>Local prices are similar to those in Shanghai, that is, they continue to rise periodically. For example, the price of rice, which is dependent on other places, was around 110,000 on May 6. The prices of other items such as fish, meat, eggs, and vegetables are also comparable to those in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Public Security and Construction</p>
<p>Public security in Jiading is quite peaceful. In addition to more than 100 police officers and a security team squadron stationed locally, there is also a Japanese military police team to maintain order together. Therefore, no major accidents have occurred. As for construction, in order to meet the needs of wartime, such as repairing roads and bridges to facilitate transportation, registering industrial and commercial businesses to improve management, establishing demonstration morning markets to promote improved seeds to increase production, organizing self-defense groups, and strengthening the Baojia system, all are being promoted and implemented.</p>
<p>Improvement of Cotton Production</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of wartime, the Chinese and Japanese authorities are working hard to develop cotton production in Central China and have established the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association. Its purpose is to develop cotton in Central China, first focusing on increasing production, and also aiming to achieve rapid improvement in variety. Regarding the cultivation of excellent varieties, it fully respects and utilizes the traditional experience. As for upland cotton, research is being conducted to achieve improvement.</p>
<p>Jiading initially only had an office under the Shanghai branch. Recently, due to the best results, the scope has been expanded, and the office has been changed to a branch. The local cotton quality is relatively poor, and only 16-count yarn can be spun. The Jinzi cotton and Dezi cotton produced by the improvement can spin 24 to 28-count yarn. At the beginning of the establishment, the county had a trial planting field of 150 mu outside the East Gate, and villagers had a special seed collection area of 3,000 mu. Technicians and technicians provided on-site guidance, and during the sowing period, lectures were held to explain sowing techniques and reasons, and cotton exhibitions were held. Currently, seed collection groups in various villages have about 24,000 mu. Last year's yield was 150 catties per mu. Based on past situations, the area is increasing year by year, so the organization is also expanding. Since last year, offices and resident stations have been established in various villages such as Nanxiang, Malu, and Xuhang.</p>
<p>Farmers are given in-kind allocations of goods at reasonable prices, such as fertilizer powder and rapeseed cake. Those who perform well in planting or spinning cotton are rewarded with commendations and cash.</p>
<p>Cooperative Enterprise</p>
<p>The Jiading Cooperative Branch is managed by the "Cooperative Enterprise Committee of the Executive Yuan" and was established in July of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943). Currently, there are more than 30,000 members. The funds within the society are more than 1.5 million yuan, which can be borrowed from local banks when necessary. Members are required to pay 50 yuan per household, and the current president is Yang Chougu (former Qingpu County magistrate), who is astute in handling affairs. The county government assisted him in difficult and complex matters.</p>
<p>Eight out of ten members are farmers, and the rest are local residents who lack an understanding of cooperative enterprises. The villagers originally hoped that after joining, they could get inexpensive allocated goods. In fact, due to limited funds, especially with the continuous rise in prices, it is difficult to purchase goods. Recognizing this, the authorities ordered an increase in funds to 500 per household. However, the villagers cannot get what they want after joining and are quite disappointed, so the capital increase has not been successful.</p>
<p>Since April of last year, when Jiading, Chongming, Baoshan, and Shenjiang were designated as agricultural increase production areas, the society established an agricultural section, focusing on rural production. The technical director is Zhao Jianjin, and there are 11 technicians, all trained at Shanghai University and experienced. There is a demonstration farm outside the East Gate of the city, covering an area of about 50 mu, engaged in improving seeds. There are also two specially contracted farms, located six li outside the West Gate. Recently, the authorities ordered it to form its own factories to produce matches, cotton yarn, native cloth, etc. for the purpose of reasonably priced allocation to farmers.</p>
<p>Regarding rural loans, contact was made with the Bank of Communications, but due to complicated procedures and the fact that the amount of loans was around 30,000 yuan, it did not help farmers. For example, the price of each cow is more than one million yuan, so no further contact was made.</p>
<p>Transportation Overview</p>
<p>The terrain is flat and the rivers are accessible in all directions. The main rivers are the Liu River on the northern border of Taicang and the Wusong River on the southern border of Qingpu, both running from west to east. There are many rivers connecting the two rivers, the more important ones being Hengtang, which runs from Luduqiao through the county seat to Nanxiang, and Yantietang, which runs through Waigang and Fangtai, both flowing in a northwest-southeast direction. In addition, Xietang runs parallel to the Liu River, passing through Waigang and the county seat to Luodian in Baoshan. These rivers all have the benefit of shipping.</p>
<p>Land transportation includes the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, which crosses the southern border, with Nanxiang, Huangdu, and Anting stations; the Baoluo Road and Luojia Road connecting the county to Baoshan and Luodian. The Shanghai-Taicang Road connects with Shanghai, passing through Nanyang and other places in Jiading. The road is 37 kilometers long, and the coal paving is 6 meters wide. The road conditions were poor after the incident, and many of the road bridges were destroyed, making driving difficult. It was necessary to get out of the car and walk when encountering bridges. Since the Reconstruction Bureau started repairs, it has improved slightly, but vehicles with heavy loads are still suffering. Currently, the China Central Long-Distance Bus Company and other private transportation companies operate on this road, all departing from Shanghai, and the fare is between 5,000 and 7,000 yuan. There are small steamer routes from Tieshang to the county seat, and small steamers from Shanghai to Suzhou also pass through Huangdu and Anting stations.</p>

<h3>All County and District Blockade Organizations in This City Will Be Abolished Today; Municipal Security Command Orders Subordinates to Comply</h3>
<p>The blockade operations in the Qingxiang area of the city were placed under the jurisdiction of the Security Command in April of this year. After more than a month, the department has made great efforts to reorganize them and they are now on track. It is now known that the department, in accordance with the city's Qingxiang implementation plan for various counties and districts, and with the consent of relevant parties, believes that these institutions are no longer necessary. It is now decided that from the 15th of this month, all blockade checkpoints and blockade organizations in various counties and districts will be abolished and inspection work will be suspended. Orders have been issued to subordinates to comply and to publicize this to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Regular Lighting Control Will Be Implemented Starting Today; Citizens Should Strictly Comply</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command, in view of the increasingly frequent intrusions of enemy aircraft into Shanghai recently, has decided to implement regular lighting control starting today (the 15th). Regardless of whether there is an alarm or not, preparatory lighting control will continue to be implemented from sunset to 10:00 p.m. as in the past, and "lighting alert control" will be implemented from 10:00 p.m. to sunrise the next day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters has also issued a notice in accordance with the command's announcement, ordering all citizens to strictly comply. Lighting control must be implemented at all times, and no light should be allowed to leak out, so as not to be caught off guard and to be prepared to deal with emergencies at any time. The Municipal Police Bureau has also ordered all sub-bureaus to strictly implement this, and will send personnel to check in their respective jurisdictions at any time. If anyone violates this lighting control and allows light to leak out, electricity will be cut off and severe penalties will be imposed. In addition, the Japanese military police authorities are also strictly enforcing lighting control inspections, and citizens are urged to pay close attention.</p>
<p>It is also reported that in order to establish an air defense posture, the Municipal Police Bureau ordered all subordinate units to immediately organize air defense groups to be responsible for air defense matters.

Relevant officials will attend.</p>
<h3>Media Organizations and Others Give Farewell to Director Liu</h3>
<p>Liu Dexuan, director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, has resigned due to illness and has been approved. Various related parties believe that Director Liu has made many contributions to propaganda during his tenure, and in order to express their parting sentiments, they have held banquets in recent days to bid him farewell. Yesterday noon, China Film Company held a farewell banquet at the Xinya Restaurant, with more than a dozen people in attendance. The host and guest exchanged speeches. At 4:00 p.m., more than a dozen units from the drama troupe and theaters held a farewell tea party at the International Hotel, with more than 20 people in attendance, which was very lively.

<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau has begun to separately execute the penalties for overdue business tax payments for the Spring Festival starting on the 11th of this month. It is understood that the distribution method for the penalties has been officially decided by the bureau: 50% will be turned over to the treasury, 10% will be turned over to the bureau, and 40% will be used for awards. The preliminary investigation work in the city's suburban areas has been completed, and the second investigation will begin soon.

Regarding the business tax payable by various businesses that handle household allocations of rice, coal balls, matches, and soap, the bureau has approved the request of the relevant industry associations to allow a 50% reduction in taxation. The non-household allocation business will still be taxed at the prescribed rate. It is also learned that the Business Tax Section of the bureau originally scheduled to hold a meeting of the directors of the business tax collection offices in each district once a week.

<h3>Registration of Major Commodities Should Be Carried Out Within the Time Limit; Those Who Fail to Register Will Be Punished</h3>
<p>In order to crack down on hoarding and profiteering and suppress prices, the Municipal Economic Bureau has held a registration of major commodities in the city for one month, from April 16 to May 15.

Now that the registration deadline is approaching, many member businesses have not yet completed the registration procedures, which is wrong. The bureau recently convened a discussion meeting with the chairpersons of the industry associations of various industries, explaining the significance of this registration of major commodities, and urged the industry associations to strictly urge all member businesses to complete the registration procedures before the deadline. Businesses that have not registered after the deadline will be severely punished in accordance with the law and will not be leniently treated.</p>

Therefore, various industrial and commercial firms that had not yet applied for registration have all automatically applied. The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, out of consideration for the hardships of businesses, not only does not penalize those who have delayed registration, but also immediately approves and notifies them to collect their licenses after investigating and confirming that their declared capital and business facts match the actual situation. Recently, the number of industrial and commercial firms that have applied for registration and received licenses within the past month is extremely large.</p>

<p>Investigation of the Taishan Baojia District by Qichang</p>
<p>The Taishan Baojia District was reorganized from the former Kuifei Baojia District. The district stretches east from Qingcheng Road, west to Chongqing Road, south from Hefei Road, and north to Great Shanghai Road. It includes six Lianbao (joint security districts), 106 Bao, and 1,207 Jia, with a current population of 200,000, 7,200 merchant households, 110 special households, 7,854 registered households, and 38,239 attached households. The district is lined with shops and is the essence of Shanghai's commercial area, occupying an extremely important position in terms of finance. The Baojia tax collected in March and April totaled over 9.83 million yuan. Recently, it is also planning to raise 23.07 million yuan for air defense expenses, which will begin soon.</p>
<p>The district is adjacent to the Nanshi, Laozha, and Huangpu districts, with extremely convenient transportation. Due to the prosperity of economic avenues, there are many gatherings of various members, which inevitably leads to those who would take risks. As a result, more theft cases occur. Recently, the Taishan District Police Sub-bureau issued a notice, instructing residents to pay attention to several key points. Because it can serve as a reference for other Baojia districts, it is briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>1.  For alleys with two or more interconnected exits, only one exit should be left open after 7 PM every evening, and the remaining alley gates should be closed uniformly.</p>
<p>2.  Each household or business should close its doors after 7 PM every evening and should not open them easily unless it is a familiar person.</p>
<p>3.  Each household should have at least one whistle.</p>
<p>4.  The telephone numbers of the Taishan Sub-bureau and the fire department should be written next to the telephone.</p>
<p>5.  If a thief breaks into the house, quickly escape out the door or enter a neighboring room, lock the door, and blow the whistle or shout for help, so that nearby police officers or civilian defense team members can rush to the scene.</p>
<p>6.  After the thief escapes, immediately follow him while sounding the alarm and shouting loudly to attract the attention of the police or civilian defense team members.</p>
<p>7.  Civilian defense team members should immediately implement a blockade upon hearing the alarm or being alerted by someone.</p>
<p>8.  Establish communication between households, such as doorbells, to facilitate the exchange of information during a burglary.</p>
<p>9.  Identify the age, appearance, clothing, and special features of the thief and immediately report it to the police station.</p>
<p>10. Always have someone sleep in the store at night, and do not lock the store door, to show that there is manpower inside.</p>
<p>Fifth "Jiuxun Cup" Middle School Mini-Football Tournament Registration Begins Today</p>

<p>*   Wing Team vs. Violent Country (Group B6, 7:30 PM)</p>
<p>*   Peier vs. Lightning (Group B3, 8:15 PM)</p>
<p>Short Comment</p>
<p>Strict Light Control</p>
<p>The Air Defense Authority of this city has decided that from today onwards, strict light control will be implemented regularly from 10 PM to sunrise the next day. During this time, residents are absolutely prohibited from having any light leaking outside.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly pointed out that there should be no light leaking outside during the light control period. We believe that it is extremely easy for residents to ensure that no light leaks outside, simply by having shielding equipment and paying attention to using it properly. Moreover, residents who can shield well and prevent light from leaking are complying with air defense regulations and will not be interfered with by the authorities. At the same time, once they develop the habit, they will not be caught off guard in the event of an air raid, and they will not become bombing targets due to light leaks, which is protecting their own safety. Therefore, preventing light from leaking is something that citizens should do for their own safety.</p>
<p>Now that the authorities have announced that strict light control will be implemented regularly from today onwards, we hope that citizens will pay close attention, especially residents of general high-rise buildings, who must personally inspect and not delegate it to servants. At the same time, we hope that police and air defense personnel will fully perform their duties and strictly correct any violators, regardless of who they are.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<p>This Newspaper's Free Education Staff Holds First Gathering</p>
<p>To Review Practical Problems and Exchange Remedial Opinions</p>
<p>The ten free elementary schools organized by the Free Education Committee of this newspaper, with 25 teachers and 10 volunteer committee members, held their first gathering last Sunday (the 13th) at Taishan Park. The weather was clear and the breeze was gentle, and everyone present was in high spirits. First, they invited photographers Huang Ningmin and Chen Boying to take pictures. The meeting began at 9:30 AM. Everyone introduced themselves, and the principals of each school reported on the school's situation in turn, exchanging opinions on all issues, such as the difficulties encountered in teaching and administrative matters, remedial measures for student absenteeism, teacher visits to student families to integrate education with life, and how to take care of children's health in the summer. After detailed review and discussion of various issues, Ms. Zhao Yizhi from Laibao Huayi School was invited to give a lecture on "Examples of Visiting Student Families." The hardship of students dropping out of school because of family difficulties and using sleep to cope with hunger was vividly described, not only deeply moving those present, but also arousing great sympathy from the hundreds of tourists who were listening in.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a story chorus sang a rowing song, and the meeting ended on a high note.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Guoshen's Altruism and Public Spirit</p>
<p>The free school gathering was held at the Minle Teahouse in Taishan Park. The owner of the teahouse, Mr. Yang Guoshen, attended as an observer. Upon hearing about the hardship of impoverished students, he expressed deep sympathy. In addition to donating 15,000 yuan on the spot for the free school's summer medicine expenses, he also offered to donate 20,000 yuan per month to each school for student tea and water expenses until the end of the semester, and to donate five dozen enamel cups. It is estimated that the donation will be over 100,000 yuan by the end of the summer vacation at the end of August. Mr. Yang's altruism and enthusiasm are admirable to all at the free school. According to reports, Mr. Yang was originally the owner of the Minle Teahouse in Daxing Park, but has recently moved to Taishan Park because the park is temporarily closed. His courage to do what is right is truly commendable. Also, Mr. Yang's relative, Mr. Wu Zaixin, who was also present as an observer, was equally enthusiastic and generously donated 20,000 yuan for the free school's summer medicine expenses, which is also admirable.</p>

Today, we newly donated 23,200 yuan and 78 books, which we are sending with this letter to express our little enthusiasm. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is only to express our sympathy.</p>
