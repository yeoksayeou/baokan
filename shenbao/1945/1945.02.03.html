<p>蘇比格灣附近敵軍登陸企圖</p>
<p>呂宋前綫二日中央社電　敵運輸船約二十艘，二十九日下午一時在戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦九艘之掩護下，侵八馬尼刺西北約百公里之蘇比格灣，遊弋一夜，三十日上午八時五十分頃，其戰艦一艘，驅逐艦七艘，運輸船七艘，靠近海岸，以艦砲開始射擊，十一時四十五分，在該灣中央之格朗迭島登陸，遭日軍激繫，目下激戰中。此次敵軍登陸之企圖，係在實現奪回菲律賓之野心，與仁牙因登陸之敵軍相呼應，以圖席捲呂宋平原，向馬尼刺南下，然於仁牙因方面之敵軍，經日軍突擊隊屢次攻擊，損失重大，不克依原定計劃前進，其作戰前途甚感困難。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地二日中央社電　截至一日止，呂宋島日軍戰果如次：仁牙因東方地區羅沙留附近戰綫，敵軍依然繼續執抝攻擊，然日軍士氣昻揚，對敵之攻擊决予擊碎與重創，敵軍由三十日左右起，攻擊羅沙留東北高地，逐次侵入，並企圖制壓康普安隘路口，反覆砲擊該地區，該方面敵之意圖制壓開諾恩公路，侵入巴歧俄鎭，敵軍於中部地區，已進至阿古諾河上流聖尼克拉斯塔由古戰綫，敵軍於運結洛扎劉斯，烏明明剛，莫尼約斯地區，以猛烈砲擊，攻擊日軍各陣地，特別於加拉邦山高地附近展開繳戰，同時敵軍更以後續兵力於薩發昻登陸，三十日晨來，薩發昂橋頭堡登陸地點，因日軍之突擊，敵陣地四處起火。仁牙因灣東方地區，由於日軍攻擊，敵軍死傷已達萬餘，克拉克地區，班班西方高地，日軍對南下之敵第十四團主力繼續猛攻，敵空軍於此方面之活躍，已入本格化。敵軍對日軍陣地，由空陸兩方予以熾烈反攻，刻正展開激烈之攻防戰。敵軍侵入馬尼剌周圍之薩發昻後，更以戰車羣，於空軍掩護下，維續南下，敵先鋒部隊已由卡倫俾特侵入接續馬尼刺地區之布拉干州，同時敵軍三十，三十一兩日以兩師於聖巴勒斯海岸及蘇比格灣內格朗迭島西岸登陸，企圖橫斷巴打半島北部，與南下之第四團混合，再以於巴坦加斯西岸登陸之部隊，由西南方以壓制馬尼刺南部，擬由南北雙方攻擊馬尼刺，然日軍於各地區以全員肉搏突擊，邀擊敵軍，刻正舊戰中。</p>
<p>呂宋日軍準備強力迎擊陣勢</p>
<p>菲島基地一日中央社電　呂宋島戰局，自敵軍爲奪取馬尼刺地區而展開機動作戰以來，戰局中心刻已逐向克拉克菲爾得一帶之呂宋平原南部地區移動，以戰車爲主力之敵軍的二師，自二十七日以來，于班班·馬尼刺·卡特·克拉克菲爾得之戰綫，與該地西方地一帶之日軍，依然激戰中。敵爲加强自克拉克地區正面及側面對日軍陣地之攻勢起見，三十日晨特以戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦等侵入巴打半島西北部之蘇比格灣，而實施砲擊，同時並以二師內外之兵力及艦船等，準備於該方面登陸，據敵方情報稱，現已開始於該方面登陸中。同時於考列基多島附近，似亦有敵小舟艇羣，茲日軍已準備强力之迎擊陣勢，故將與敵人展開大出血戰。</p>

<h3 id="c6">松島部長談　返日觀感　日本一億國民戰意昂揚 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>盟邦日本陸海外聯合報道會於昨日下午三時在匯中飯店舉行，到松島部長，鑒田大尉，松本大尉及囑托林俊夫，坂爪，王炳南，劉鎭南及各報記者數十人。</p>
<p>鹽田大尉榮轉要職</p>
<p>首由松島部長介紹新任艦隊報道部主計大尉松本十郎與記者相見稱：鹽田大尉近將榮轉，由松本大尉繼任職務，鹽田大尉在過去兩年半的長時間任此要職，對中日親善，尤著有功績，際此戰局非常緊迫，中日親善工作特別重要之冥頑，鹽田大尉適轉勤他往，吾人自不免感覺遺憾，渠以進級等關係，離此亦非得已。新任松本大尉係東京帝大法科出身，現以兩年現役，近在艦上服務，希望諸位與對鹽田大對有同樣連繫，俾使鹽田大尉之成績，愈益發揚光大。一個人的來去，事本平常，但此時送別鹽田大尉，硃抱有惜別之感。一方面祝鹽田大尉更進一層努力奮鬥，同時對松本大討亦抱有無限期待。</p>
<p>全日國民戰意昂揚</p>
<p>本人一月下旬曾赴東京一行，聞貝所得，擬略作申述如下：本人經一年又三個月的長時問未返日本，此次前往獲睹純決戰態勢的日本，一億國民均以特攻精神，極爲激昻興奮，在日一般國民雖屢遭敵B29型轟炸，但戰意昂揚，毫未受挫，最受崇拜之伊勢神宮，亦遭波及，益使日國民戰意昻揚起來。最近決戰化政治機稱，業已完成，此在議會問答上，可以見到。其次，最使人注意者，敵雖極力宣傳空製日本，但在東京及其他都市均未見有何損害。更値得注意者，在都市裏無論住宅，商店或工廠，以疏散關係，表面上略現簫條情况，而路上跑的人，莫不活潑朝氣爲完成任務而邁進。日本在過去二千六百年的歷史上，向未遭外敵侵略，此次雖遭受轟炸，一般國民毫不紊亂，且極爲鎭靜，此種活潑精神，即婦孺亦然，而在未空襲時反覺寂寞耳。</p>
<p>增產問題驚人成績</p>
<p>再則本人先前最憂慮的爲生產問題，經見聞所及，悉生產方面，雖屢遭敵機轟炸，絲臺未受影響，推其原因，則爲日本空軍邀擊得力，防空設備完善，以及對燒夷彈等之處置之周密。去年十二月至今年三月的生產比可有巧妙的表現出來。同時日本物資配給方法完備，保甲組織完善，對一般。最使人感激者，爲一般男女學生，莫不勤勞奉公，以致戰勝爲止的精神，即一般人亦均抱戰勝利底，克服任何困難的堅決意志。</p>
<p>日軍戰法使敵出血</p>
<p>關於菲律賓戰局，敵方用盡手段企圖進攻馬尼拉作戰，實則菲律賓運命，不在馬尼拉作戰。日本戰法，在強迫敵方使多出血。現在大東亞戰爭在作戰方式上，與以前不無變更，無論時間上地點上，均與以前不同。山下大將曾謂：敵方對此次作戰，亦發生疑問。一月九日舊金山廣播，指本人稱：最樂觀的松島大佐稱因美國進攻菲律賓作，將使日本與南方資源斷云云，本人不才，使美國廣播電台注意，極爲光榮，本人向無此種發表，處等亦代本人廣播，更爲感謝。</p>
<p>南方路綫毫無影響</p>
<p>現在日美作戰均爲消耗戰，縱使非律賓作戰將南方資源切斷，日本已早有準備及作戰力量。此次本人旅行所見，南方資源如切斷，日感缺乏者爲鋁類原料，但日方早已準備代替品，毫無影響。敵方宣傳拉巴爾島已完全切斷，現仍有極多日軍存在。日軍富有自主自立力量，今後戰局究如何發展，雖難預料，但日本作戰，一定誘敵至近處將其擊滅，此種方針，始終不變。</p>
<p>敵機殘暴掃射民船</p>
<p>旋鹽田大尉談稱：關於美軍之殘無人道，過去曾屢有表現，近竟將中國毫無防備之民船，濫肆轟炸。於一月十六日載有二百四十名客人之中華輪船公司之船一艘，在長江上游航行，有敵機四架發現船上毫無設備及所載均係良民乃大肆投彈及機槍掃射。據該船船長報告稱：十六日下午二時許，有四架敵機在二千米高度發現，少頃，該機低至一百米低空，船長採臨機應變措置，船客無法逃避，經三十分鐘時間的反復機槍掃射，結果乘客死三十四名，傷四十五五名，本來作戰有戰鬥員及非戰鬥員之別，日軍作戰向在道義上有此區別，而美國則不然，發現船上爲良民，反認爲良機，不惜採取暴虐手段，致使受傷乘客，均爲中國人，如漢口及上海之盲炸，均爲非人道的蹂躪，今後敵美恐仍將繼續下去。曾憶百年以前，美國曾有澳大利亞號船自滬運華人千名至美，中途均死彼等手中，美國之殘無人道，係其歷史上之一貫作風。日華必須緊密合作，將此帶人類假面具之殘敵，予以粉碎。最後對此次受害之七十九人及其家屬，表示無限遺憾。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c7">粵漢路打通的意義與影響 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>上年十二月十日日軍在華部隊和越南部隊，在桂越國境會師，打通了國際大陸路綫；自此以後，東亞大陸自北至南的縱斷綫，除以韶關爲中心的粵漢路一小段外，已完全打通。最近，日軍湘粵部隊繼綫挺進，南北兩路日軍，已於一月二十七日在樂昌，韶關間會師。從此，大陸縱斷綫已通行無阻。</p>
<p>這次作戰一面表現着日軍力量的雄厚。日軍雖在菲律賓方面須以精銳並大量部隊抗禦敵美海陸空的進攻；但仍能在中國大陸照常以迅速而有力的聲勢，再度進展，續獲巨大的戰果。</p>
<p>另一方面是愈益暴露渝軍的脆弱。這次作戰發動於一月初頭，至一月中旬日軍展開猛攻，祗十天時間，就完成了重大任務。沿粵漢路的湘粵交界處，多峻險山道，且號稱有天險可守，現在也竟無法守住。又據說渝軍敗退時，重要軍事設施及交通設備，運樂昌和白石間隧道橋樑，也都未曾破壞，可見慌亂之甚。</p>
<p>粵漢路完全打通後，不論就大陸作戰和非島學滅敵美之戰，對日軍都有很大的作用。今後日軍南北部隊的調動和給義的輸送，將獲得更多的便利，而海洋和大陸的關係，也可以取得更緊密的連繫。敵美企圖在中國大陸牽制日軍，可是一再失敗。目前日軍不但打通了粵漢路，而且又自廣州東南經惠州而攻略近南的海豐陸豐要地，並按制粵省沿海地區，不啻給予敵美亦華南沿海登陸的妄想一個當頭棒。日軍先聲奪人，敵美如敢向沿海來犯，必痛遭擊滅無疑。所以粵漢路的戰果，有助於日軍非律賓的作戰，也極爲巨大。</p>
<p>再，日軍同時又佔領西南的遂川，並正在向贛州推進。遂川贛州是敵美在華的重要空軍根據地，空襲華中南的敵機，大都即來自這些根據地的飛機塲。這給與敵美空中遊擊戰的打擊顯然也是極大。</p>
<p>綜觀這次日軍的戰果，可以證明日軍在戰略上所需要的據點，都有隨時堂握的力量。同時，這次打通粵漢路作戰，並非僅爲打擊重慶，更積極的是防範敵美登陸企圖，而克盡保衛東亞的責任。</p>
<p>最近由於歐洲戰爭形勢的急迫，菲島作戰的緊張，一般人視綫集中於此，因之善於造謠生事者遂得散佈流言的機會，經這次日軍大陸作戰的又一成功，可以移轉視綫，並攻破造謠者的流言。</p>

<p>本人此次奉命調長司法，堅辭弗獲，業於昨日到部就職，本爲政不在多言之旨，僅就個人願望，向本部同人言之。本人向以本位全力服務黨國爲宗旨，前此奉派接收各地租界以及計劃上海市政統一等工作，無非思在此方而竭盡棉力，使國家人民兩受其益，司法與人民關係更爲密切，倘使法院裁判不得其平，監獄管理未能完善，直接間接，均足以增加人民痛苦。此後當一本初衷，並根據現實環境，就司法行政上設法改善，期使民眾痛苦，得以減少。</p>

<p>東京二日中央社電　關於美國對中共妥協之斡旋，除懷某種政治野心外，並謀干涉渝方內政，另一方面基於其對日作戰，亦使其痛感有急速將此實現之必要。蓋在渝美空軍由於去年下半期華中華南基地之喪失，爲急謀補充起見，不能不着手於基地工作之進行，於是國共合作，遂成爲不可缺少之前題條件。據最近北京消息，在渝美空軍最近除於蘭州設置三處根據地外，更於寗夏省方而亦準備設置基地，由於此種工作之愈益尖銳化，故美國對重慶之壓迫，亦勢必愈形加重。</p>

<p>大陸基地一日中央社電　日轟炸部隊，利用惡劣天氣進攻敵美空軍之前進基地芷江機場，排除敵戰鬥機之邀擊及熾烈之對空砲火，全彈命中目標，燒毀機型不明者三架，大型一架，小型一架，擊毀五架，日慶安然歸還。</p>
<p>大陸戰場成要塞化</p>
<p>湖南前綫一日中央社電　粵漢綫南段之打通，茲已告成，在渝美空軍最後根據地之遂川，業八日軍堂中，此次作戰戰果如次：（一）第三，第四，第九各戰區之分裂。（二）漢口，廣州問之粵漢綫悉被打通。（三）中國東南部美空軍最後基地之遂贛基地羣茲全爲日軍佔領，日軍大陸縱貫作戰，業將中國東南部完全佔據。按第三·第七·及第四·第九戰區之一部，乃第七戰區之迴廊，復爲余漢謀，顧祝同，薛岳之共同戰綫，該戰將之目的，乃在與以何應欽爲新德司令之中國西南部渝軍相互策應，而由背腹兩面攻繫，並切斷日軍大陸縱貫綫路。然此次作戰告終後，渝軍之此等內外戰區，業已全部分裂，故渝軍之企岡，亦被粉碎。此次因日軍作戰迅速，致令渝軍未及破壞粵漢路之鐵軌以及鐵橋，而將之完全佔領。至此，漢口衡陽間之粵漢綫北段之工程告竣時際，於粵漢綫之打通，當指日可斷也。</p>
<p>又以遂川·贛州爲中心之遂贛基地羣，乃爲渝美空軍於中國東南部最後基地，敵軍曾據此執抝轟炸日軍佔領地區內之場十江，及東中國海之航行路，並欲將之遮斷，今由於遂川之喪失，故遂贛基地羣之勢力，已減其一半，而其餘之基地羣，又在日軍之威脅力下，而難以發揮其威力。現在廣州·杳港地區已與衡陽相通，而華南沿岸要衝亦與日軍貫穿大陸中央之戰綫相運，故即使敵軍接觸大陸之際，日軍當可發揮朝鮮·滿洲·廣州·香港間之大陸動脈之威力，而使之潰滅，此次作戰可謂日軍過去四閱月間進攻作戰之成果，至此，大陸要塞化之目的，遂行完成。</p>
<p>日軍作戰益增活躍</p>
<p>廣州二日中央社電　此次日軍打通粵漢綫，實爲大東亞戰局以來一重大之階段。緣此縱貫湘鄂之粵漢路一帶，在物資方面觀之，米穀，花生，小麥，桐油，鎢煤之出產實爲大宗，並產量極爲豐富，成爲培養華南渝方抗戰力之泉源，而該鐵路前經日軍之猛攻的九百八十餘公里，已被日軍佔領者六百三十公里，其餘之三百五十公里，在日機猛炸下，完全喪失運輸能力，僅能於郴縣以南至廣東省英德間。自大東亞戰爭以來，渝方並使粵漢綫與支綫衡桂綫東運結十公里，同時與欽桂南岸貴陽一綫及龍州南寗桂林之二大公路交叉，成爲西南建設共站線，但目前自漢口起，從長沙衡陽韶關等要衝，至展州之粵漢線，已完全貫通，更與平漢線連結，縱貫中國大陸之大鐵道，將成爲日軍有利之運輸，而過去之渝方抗戰大動脈，至今已全部被割，日軍利用此大動脈，對此作戰上益增其活躍力量。</p>
<p>日挺進隊艱苦備嘗</p>
<p>湖南前線二日中央社電　自此次日軍主力於粵漢線南段開始作戰以來，其南進部隊僅五日即進抵樂昌，突入有名之大庾嶺山脈，壓制白石樂昌間之天險，其間曾跋涉於堿十公里鐵道上之橋樑隧道等十處，其活躍令人敬服。即東由湘粵省境至大廋嶺山峻最高峯，爲達一千二百公尺之峻嶺，以構成白石樂昌間約三十公里之難關，突過其間粵漢線中之隧道五橋樑，凡此俱爲耗費龐大之勞力與資材，經相當月而建設成功者，故此次南段作戰之日軍，誠然煞費苦心。蓋渝軍於未破壞此等橋樑隧道之前，仍極力圖確保，而日南進部隊則秘密施行特種訓練，以數挺進部隊，切斷渝軍退路，並爲確保橋樑隧道，乃首先開始作戰，而逐决潛行，並巧妙突破渝軍嚴重監視，並山險道路，極盡勞苦。半月後之十九日，又以白石樂昌鐵道爲目標，開始活躍，此如八無人之境之各挺進隊，忽又次第確保十處之橋樑隧道，故此種英勇苦鬥精神，是爲决定此次打通粵漢線作戰之成功。</p>

<p>柏林二日中央社電　海通社訊：二十四小時內洪都西南之戰事雖烈，但無變動。南段蘇軍之攻勢仍未減緩，主要目標在上西里西亞工業區內，由里勃尼克以達格羅高之蘇軍，向沃特河逼進，蘇軍先鋒隊企圖在某數點渡河，德軍拒之。東普魯士境內無特殊重要之軍事發展，德軍仍處主動地位，德軍在康尼斯堡迤西成立走廊，使此方守軍與東普魯士他處之德軍獲得接觸，蘇軍企圖封閉此走廊來逞。蘇柯夫將軍之部隊有衝破德軍防綫，直逼柏林之雄圖，該區戰事已引起世人之矚目，蘇軍長官亦知孤軍深入，殊屬冒險。波森戰事仍烈，蘇軍先鋒隊日前已渡奧勃拉河，最近坦克車隊及步兵勁旅亦已渡河西進，將協助先鋒隊在蘇黎曹·希維布斯·梅塞里茲及希維林等處作戰，於是蘇軍與扼守邊境之德軍之大戰場，已西移至大沃特河與瓦翠河套之中心，此區內目前當有大規模之戰事。尼芝河方面，特里森與希尼台莫爾之間亦有軍事行動，希尼合莫爾仍在德軍堂握中，蘇軍先鋒隊經過此城，向德意志克洛納區衝八，業已被阻。已越尼芝河之蘇軍，於渡河後即行西進，業已衝過倫特斯堡而入諾艾馬克區，蘇軍光鋒隊進抵沙爾汀（Soldin）庫斯特林（Kustrin在法蘭克福之北）戰綫。尼芝河北蘇軍之使命，顯欲保護在沃特河與瓦翠河套內作戰之軍，吾人展開地圖，即知此段情勢之重要。吾人就蘇軍長官行動之審慎觀察，即知蘇將業憶顧慮德軍即將進行大規模之反攻矣</p>
<p>東普魯士戰事激烈</p>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　德國社訊，德軍發言人於星期四宣稱：東普魯士方面蘇軍，已將德軍陣綫再稍爲壓小，蘇軍現時企圖向比勞推進，該地爲康尼斯堡海港之入口要地，該處激戰革行中。</p>
<p>波摩前方形勢穩定</p>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　海通社訊：波希米亞摩拉維亞山間道路，積雪旣除，軍運又趨通暢，大批軍隊及重兵器供應品等，正急遽向西里西亞前綫增援，故沃特西岸之蘇軍橋頭堡，已無能擴展矣。橋頭堡中之最重要者，如在沃特河東作戰之德裝甲軍一部，今亦調至河西岸助戰，現該處集積之德步兵有四五師團之衆，蘇軍企圖由此切斷西里西亞與北部之交通，目前似無實現之可能。此外斯達諾橋頭堡復興奧勞橋頭堡負有包圍布萊斯勞之使命，蘇軍特將拉的波爾。柯塞爾森林迤東之坦克第三軍北調，以助前兩橋頭堡，由此可見其對該兩地之重視。沃特河上游兩岸集積之蘇軍，亦有步兵三十五師團及坦克兩大隊，準備進窺摩拉維亞之大門，一方面德軍亦迅速增援，保衛工業中心，預料蘇軍來攻必遭重創。</p>

<p>本市周市長接事之初，曾對本市今後民生一再表示决意，尤爲積極設法，疏通米糧來源，同時爲首先安定公務員，新聞從業員生活計，特列人重點配給而對整個市民生活，表示盡最大努力，於短期間解决。記書以市府對於今後民食既表决心維特，但對整個米糧來源問題，其賣仍在業統會當局之協助如何，故爲明瞭該會收買米糧之進農，及今後如何協力市府，安定民生起見，特走訪米統會陳主任委員，承答覆如下：</p>
<p>收買工作進行現狀</p>
<p>（一）關於本會收買米糧工作進行現狀，本以一二兩月爲收買最吒時期，故爲積極推進收買工作計，特於最近期內派多數幹員至各產米區協助工作，於友邦挺身隊協力之下，採購米糧當可如期收購預定數量運滬充沛民食，此爲收買工作之現狀，但目前因有困難三點，致本市來源，尙無法於短期內通。（一）黃金問題本爲收購米糧先決問題，本會會對此事努力籌劃，目前是項問題，遂告解决，資金充足之後，收購米糧進展，當然不成問題。（二）運輸問題，過去本會米糧運滬全賴內河航輪，近因時屆冬令，天氣儼寒，河這凍結，船隻無法通行，因之米糧來滬被阻，但此爲時令問題，不久當可恢復。（三）治安問題因四鄉治安不良，數產米區收得米糧運輸時遇困雖，無法源源運滬。以上諸點，實爲阻碍米糧運滬主要原因。但本會爲打破是項雖關，目前正局部設法中，短期內當可解決。（二）至於市府决心增加配給米問題。本會唯一協力，即爲積極增加來源，於周市長旣經決定方針之下，竭力努力本位工作，務求供需相等。</p>
<p>戶口米糧即可配給</p>
<p>（三）戶口米久不配給事，其原因因最近配給機構交替，新任當局因從事着手整理內部，因之稍延誤日期，是項米糧，本會早經準備，故不當可如期配給。（四）關於抑平米價，市府本表決心，但是項問題，端在全市民衆協力，方能奏效，本會積極疏通來源，如期維持戶口米糧配給，民食解決之後，黑市米糧自然無人問津，則黑市米價之下跌，爲必然現象。惟查華中民食過去自給，本不敷足，向賴外洋暹米補充，自大東亞戰爭保發之后，外運斷絕，但消費數量一如往時，加以年來農村欠收，米糧缺乏，本爲必然之理，政府當局前爲補救是項缺陷計，曾發動麵食運動，希望民眾增補麵食，是項運動華北方面，已早見實行，故年來該地民食恐慌已告解决，江南各地民眾，因未能效法，故是以米糧不足，仍無法解决，加以本市一般商人，竟而乘機囤積，原有運滬供應糧食，全被操縱，致使無法普遍應市，是點實爲米糧高漲主要原因，故本人意見欲抑米價，須賴民間各方協力，方能達成理想之工作。</p>

<h3 id="c32">提倡節約聲中應實行的幾件事 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 堯</p>
<p>年來因物力艱　，民生困竭，提倡節約之聲，瀰漫社會。政府方面，有社會福利部倡導在上，民間亦有上海市民節約協會之設，名流演謂，報章鼓吹，不遺餘力。但夷考實際，則確在實行節約者，無非一般購買力低到瀕於凍餒的薪工階級，這輩人不待他人之勸導，自已早已節的到無可再節釣的地步。而再觀一殷獲得戰時暴利的商人，依舊窮奢極慾，揮霍無度，根本想不到　節物力。這種現象，亟待社會領袖時時以移風易俗爲巴任，身體力行，不尙空言，自作表率。道種精神，上月二十四日聞蘭亭先生娶孫媳婦時的節釣情形，庶幾近之。</p>
<p>吾們認爲提倡節約辦法，如陳翁太高，難收實效。茲提出幾件切實易行的事例，希望大家積極推行。</p>
<p>边來常見人家發生喪事，往往初喪時刊登報喪廣告，或遍發報喪條子。於是親友們便不得不化了車資，趕往送殮，致送吊禮。迨五七開弔，更大模大樣地預先幾天登報計告，遍發訃聞，使親友們再來一次破費。這種雙重耗費金錢光陰的舉動，違悖節約之旨太遠，亟應提倡改革。</p>
<p>我們主張以後社會人才不幸遭逢喪事，如果初喪時已登報喪或遍發報喪條子者，就不應有五七發訃開弔的一回事。如果重視開弔者，那末初喪時就不必大舉報喪，以免親友變重跋涉，勞民傷財。在被通知的親友方面，如初喪已往吊奠送禮，則五七開吊時大可不必再往。</p>
<p>二·舊曆新年，廢除已久；但社會積重難返，過去數年，雖在戰時，仍有拜年舊習。目下車資昻貴，短短的路程，動輙以一二百元計，茶賞一項，每到一家，也非百元不成格局。如在舊曆新年四天以內，平均每人往十家親友處拜年，則每人就至少須化三千元。况依習慣而論，禮尙往來，地位相同的親友，你來拜年，我應答拜；於是統計道四天以內爲拜年一事而發生的浪費數額，一定大得可驚。並且出去拜年的人，依平時觀察，總是以仰求於人者居多。這輩人大都是賴薪度日，平時已甚艱難，安能負擔這額外的支出？</p>
<p>吾們主張今年應澈底革除拜年陋習，俾一般中間階級得以稍輕負擔，並乘此初春休假期內，予這輩終年勞碌的略事休息。此事的實行，重在各機關團體及工商廠號的高級人員首先提倡，劃切對下屬及戚友宜示今年廢除拜年的決心，俾以身作則，使下屬及有求於我者不必有不拜年恐影響前和的顯慮。上海市民節約協會更應大聲疾呼，積極倡導，期牧實效。</p>
<p>此外如舊曆年底親友餽贈年禮，爲早巳逝世的人做其壽，做逝世紀念，或跡近抽風，或耗時傷財，均不合節的原則，那更應力予革除之事，不必詞費了。</p>
<h3 id="c33">上海貧兒院參觀記 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>在上海社會，有三十餘年歷史的「上海貧兒院」，記者夙聞其苦幹實幹之精神，日前抽暇前往參觀，得悉其院董陳中孚先生等，在此數年來，苦心維持之不易。但在目下社會病態如此嚴重時期，貧寒子弟，能在這樣的樂園中享受敎養兼有之幸福，誠屬不幸中之大幸。</p>
<p>該院院址是在南市局門路。它的對門，是瞿真人廟。院基有地四十餘畝，在上海都市社會中，罕有如此廣大的塲所。可惜大部份院舍，在此次事變時，都遭毀壞，所以現在僅有院舍十餘間，最最特著的，它和金融界×××等合作，闢有農牧場一所。有乳牛，有蜜蜂，有菜園，有苗圃，它們職中部的農科學生，就在這農場中實習。</p>
<p>是日，是由該院吳主任領導我在該院巡禮一週，方知該院在因陋就簡中，設有敎室七間，辦公室二間，學生宿舍敎職員宿舍共四間，廚房儲藏室等共三間，規模尙可。因在寒假時間，對於各級授課實况，不克目覩。</p>
<p>現在該院小學部學生，共有三百餘人。該院的附額生即通學生，不但不收學費，速敎科書亦由該院發給。所以在該院附近的貧寒子弟，受惠實多。吳君云：該院院生入院手續是普遍化的，任何貧寒子弟的家族，皆可來院甲請，故該院院生，較多於其他慈幼機關。吳君又云：該院院生敎的方式，注重「精神訓練」及「手腦並用」；故該院畢業生，概多服務勤愼，忠實可靠。若閔行萬昌醬園，因守畢業生工作之優良，在其醬園中爲學徒者，有四人之眾</p>
<p>記者又詢以該院組織及經濟情形。據吳君云：該院最高組織爲董事會，由董事會推選二人，以院長及監院名義執行該院行政工作；因此，該院院務，等於董事會直接負責。慮，因該院經常收入，僅有田地二百餘畝，一年所收之田租，以現狀而言，不敷一個月支付之數。因此，僅能向社會乞求援助。吳君又云：該院目前淸宣統元年成立迄今，業已三十七年，從未公開勸募，目下因物價非常高漲，董事會實有力難勝任之苦，不得已向社會熱心人士呼籲。記者聆吳君之言，亦深以爲然，望社會熱心人士，慨惠仁漿，造福孤貧，誠積善無窮之舉也！</p>
<p>又聞著名電影明星李　華小姐，鑒於該院事業之重要，經費之艱困，决定於本月五日假座黃金大戲院躬自登台義演京劇，並邀請名票名伶會串，藉盡徵責，想義演之日，必有一番盛況！（廣聞）</p>

<p>— 小波</p>
<p>「天才」的意思，是說一種技藝並米經過很深的學習，就能領悟，就能熟孄，似乎先天性的感應，似乎是與生俱來的。這原是比較說法，有些人也許反對遙種見解的，可是，事實上確有令人驚異的奇確存在！</p>
<p>一個年僅六歲半的小孩，能够奏鋼琴，已經罕聞，而能奏世界名曲四十餘支，並且自己會作曲，內行的間樂家一致讚賞，這才是奇蹟。如果說這個小孩有音樂天才，是一個神意，也不會過分吧！</p>
<p>他叫韓喬治，兩個姊姊叫美齡沙菲，都彈得一手好琴，他生長在一個間樂氣氛很濃厚的家庭裏，五歲時候就站在姊姊身旁聽奏鋼琴，留戀不去，若有所悟，其姊奏畢輔去，他就坐上琴概，居然鏗鏘起來，使他姊姊的音樂敎師吃了一駕，在他的小袋裏已經充滿着音樂曲子，極力我機會表達出來。其後，就由敎師敎他，他很快的純熱了。到了六歲生日的一天，他的父母爲他舉行一次音樂會，當塲彈奏鋼琴，更加驚起了許多音樂家們，這還不是天才嗎？</p>
<p>現在他的家長想以孩童的力量帮助貧苦孩童，決定於二月六日假座蘭心戲院舉行鋼琴義奏會，由喬治主奏，兩姊伴奏，以劵資所得完全捐助慈幼善舉，本處代售榮譽券，分五千三千一千元三種。我們希望愛好音樂的仕女，尤其小朋友，小妹妹們，大家來欣賞欣賞，一定會皆大歡喜的。門券可向本處或新聞報新中國報社會服務攔購取。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Forces Launch Mobile Warfare, Courageously Engaging the Enemy in a Decisive Battle; General Headquarters Announces the Latest Situation in Luzon <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced the latest situation on Luzon Island at 5:20 PM on the 2nd as follows: (1) The enemy forces of seven or eight divisions that landed in the Lingayen Gulf area are still mainly attacking the Japanese military positions in the mountainous area east of the Pangasinan Plain. Approximately two divisions are gradually moving south toward Manila Bay. A portion advanced into the area in front of Clark Field and near San Fernando in late January. Another enemy force landed near Subic Bay on January 30th. The Japanese troops in the eastern region of the Pangasinan Plain inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. In late January, they retreated from the positions near San Fabian to the mountains of Lower Balangay. Subsequently, along the battle line from near Damortis, eastward to Rosario, and near San Manuel, they repulsed enemy attacks. Furthermore, since January 16th, they have been engaging in fierce fighting with enemy mobile units that have invaded the northeast region of Mount Bacabac, repulsing these units with mobile warfare tactics. A unit of the Japanese tank forces bravely conducted a night raid on enemy troops near San Manuel on the night of January 27th, inflicting significant losses. (3) The losses inflicted on the enemy forces that landed in Lingayen Gulf, as far as can be determined, include 11,200 casualties, and the destruction or capture of 114 tanks and 71 artillery pieces of various types.</p>
<p>Philippine Islands Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The two divisions of the enemy's 14th Army, operating in the Clark Field area, are attacking the Japanese military positions in the highlands west of Bamban. The two armies are engaged in a bloody battle for the highlands. A portion of the enemy forces invaded Angeles, south of Clark Field, from the 27th. Utilizing fast-moving tank units, they invaded San Fernando, a key point on the road to Manila, on the 30th. Their vanguard advanced several miles from there toward Manila, reaching the vicinity of the Pampanga River, the largest river on Luzon Island, about 30 kilometers from Manila. The enemy forces that are rapidly invading Manila are now in a state where their rear communications rely solely on air transport. It is observed that the Japanese army is launching mobile operations against the isolated enemy vanguard from the flanks of the enemy's advance route and the front of Manila, in order to crush them in one fell swoop. The situation around the Pampanga River for the past few days is worthy of close attention.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Attempt to Land Near Subic Bay</p>
<p>Luzon Front, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Approximately twenty enemy transport ships, under the cover of one battleship, two cruisers, and nine destroyers, invaded Subic Bay, about 100 kilometers northwest of Manila, on the afternoon of the 29th at 1 PM. After maneuvering overnight, at around 8:50 AM on the 30th, one of their battleships, seven destroyers, and seven transport ships approached the coast and began shelling with naval guns. At 11:45 AM, they landed on Grande Island in the center of the bay, encountering fierce resistance from the Japanese forces, and fierce fighting is currently underway. The enemy's attempt to land this time is to realize their ambition to recapture the Philippines and to echo the enemy forces that landed in Lingayen, in order to sweep across the Luzon Plain and advance south toward Manila. However, the enemy forces in the Lingayen area have suffered heavy losses due to repeated attacks by Japanese commando units and are unable to advance according to their original plan, making their future operations very difficult.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - As of the 1st, the results of the Japanese army's battles on Luzon Island are as follows: In the Rosario area east of Lingayen, the enemy continues to stubbornly attack, but the Japanese army's morale is high, and they are determined to crush and heavily damage the enemy's attacks. From around the 30th, the enemy began attacking the highlands northeast of Rosario, gradually invading and attempting to control the Camp One Pass, repeatedly shelling the area. The enemy's intention in this area is to control Kennon Road and invade Baguio City. In the central area, the enemy has advanced to the Saint Nicholas-Tayug battle line on the upper reaches of the Agno River. The enemy is fiercely shelling the Japanese army's positions in the Urdaneta, Umingan, and Muñoz areas, especially engaging in close combat near the Caragan Mountain highlands. At the same time, the enemy is landing subsequent troops in Sapaong. Since the morning of the 30th, the Sapaong bridgehead landing site has been ablaze due to Japanese attacks. In the eastern region of Lingayen Gulf, the enemy's casualties have reached over ten thousand due to Japanese attacks. In the Clark area, on the highlands west of Bamban, the Japanese army continues to fiercely attack the main force of the enemy's 14th Regiment which is heading south. The enemy air force's activity in this area has become full-scale. The enemy army is launching fierce counterattacks on the Japanese army's positions from both the air and the ground, and fierce offensive and defensive battles are currently underway. After the enemy invaded Sapaong around Manila, they continued south with tank groups under the cover of the air force. The enemy vanguard has invaded Bulacan Province, which is adjacent to the Manila area from Calumpit. At the same time, on the 30th and 31st, the enemy landed two divisions on the coast of San Ildefonso and the west coast of Grande Island in Subic Bay, attempting to cut off the northern part of the Bataan Peninsula, mix with the 4th Regiment moving south, and then use the forces landing on the west coast of Batangas to suppress the southern part of Manila from the southwest, planning to attack Manila from both the north and south. However, the Japanese army is engaging and attacking the enemy in all areas with all-out close-quarters combat, and fierce fighting is currently underway.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces on Luzon Prepare for Strong Counterattack</p>
<p>Philippine Islands Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the enemy forces launched mobile operations to seize the Manila area, the center of the battle on Luzon Island has gradually shifted to the southern region of the Luzon Plain around Clark Field. The enemy's two divisions, with tanks as the main force, have been engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in the area west of the Bamban-Manila-Calumpit-Clark Field battle line since the 27th. In order to strengthen the offensive against the Japanese army's positions from the front and sides of the Clark area, on the morning of the 30th, the enemy used battleships, cruisers, destroyers, etc. to invade Subic Bay in the northwestern part of the Bataan Peninsula and carry out shelling. At the same time, they are preparing to land in that area with forces inside and outside the two divisions and warships. According to enemy intelligence, they have already begun landing in that area. At the same time, near Corregidor Island, there seems to be a group of enemy small boats. The Japanese army is prepared for a strong counterattack, and a major bloody battle with the enemy will unfold.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Taiwanese Youths Hold Enlistment Ceremony <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Taiwan, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The first enlistment ceremony for Taiwanese youths after the implementation of conscription was held on February 1st. For the 70 years since Taiwan was governed by Japan, the 6.7 million islanders have worked tirelessly, day and night, to cultivate the spirit of good citizens. Since the beginning of the China Incident and the Great East Asia War, their spirit of dying for their country has become even more passionate. When the special volunteer soldier systems for the army (implemented in Showa 17 [1942]) and the navy (implemented in Showa 18 [1943]) were implemented, there was an unusually enthusiastic response from volunteers on the island. After the implementation of the conscription system on the island in September of Showa 18 [1943], all youths on the island were finally able to fulfill their highest wish. Now, a number of young men from the island, after being processed into eight camps on February 1st, will be assigned to units in Taipei and other areas to assume the great responsibility of guarding the territory.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Air Raid on Syonan Island (Singapore) <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Military Base, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - At 11:00 AM on the 1st, ninety B-29 aircraft flying from a base in Calcutta invaded Syonan Island (Singapore) in nine formations. Using the Seletar area as the center, they conducted blind bombing from an altitude of 9,000 meters. The Japanese anti-aircraft artillery units launched a fierce counterattack, and at 12:30 PM, the enemy aircraft began to flee to the northwest. The Japanese air force shot down one of the aircraft over Kranji and continued the pursuit, expanding the results of the battle. The damage on the Japanese side was minimal. It is believed that the enemy aircraft's bombing and reconnaissance operations since November 11th were intended to constrain the operations in the Philippines.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Diet Enters Second Half of Session <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Diet has now entered the second half of its session after reconvening. On February 1st, the House of Representatives did not hold a plenary session, only convening committees on wartime civil affairs, the Central Cooperative Bank for Agriculture and Forestry, seamen's insurance, and equipment corporations, to deliberate on various bills. Similarly, the House of Peers did not hold a plenary session. During the Budget Committee meeting, members raised questions about strengthening wartime food production, reforming bureaucratic politics, and mobilizing students. Prime Minister Koiso, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada, and Minister of Welfare Hirose responded to the questions.</p>
<p>Japanese Scientists Strive for Wartime Research</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Dr. Yagi, President of the Japanese Technology Institute, stated on the 1st in the House of Representatives Pension Law Committee, in response to a question from Mr. Kino, regarding the Technology Institute's wartime posture, that the capabilities of Japanese scientists, if fully realized, are definitely not inferior to those of the United States. Since the implementation of the wartime researcher system the previous year, more than 200 wartime research projects have been conducted at the Technology Institute, mobilizing 6,000 wartime researchers who are determined to conduct research. Hundreds of others are conducting preparatory research. Under the direction of the Japanese Aviation Technology Promotion Association, they are engaged in wartime research. Researchers have abandoned all miscellaneous tasks and are focusing solely on wartime research. This is the spirit of scientific personnel's requisition and conscription, dedicating themselves to research.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Director Matsushima Discusses Impressions of Return Trip to Japan: 100 Million Japanese People Have Soaring Fighting Spirit <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Japan-Allied Nations Army and Navy Joint Information Conference was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Hui Zhong Hotel, attended by Director Matsushima, Captain Shioda, Captain Matsumoto, entrustees Lin Junfu, Sakazume, Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, and dozens of reporters from various newspapers.</p>
<p>Captain Shioda Promoted to Important Position</p>
<p>Director Matsushima began by introducing the new Accounting Captain Matsumoto, of the Fleet Information Department, to the reporters, stating: Captain Shioda will soon be honorably transferred, and Captain Matsumoto will succeed him in his position. Captain Shioda has held this important position for the long period of two and a half years, making special contributions to Sino-Japanese friendship. At this time of great urgency in the war situation, the work of Sino-Japanese friendship is particularly important. We cannot help but feel regret at Captain Shioda's transfer to another position. His departure is also unavoidable due to promotions and other factors. The new Captain Matsumoto graduated from the Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University and has served on ships for the past two years. I hope that everyone will maintain the same connection with Captain Matsumoto as they had with Captain Shioda, so that Captain Shioda's achievements can be further developed. The coming and going of a person is a common occurrence, but at this time of farewell to Captain Shioda, we have a feeling of regret. On the one hand, we wish Captain Shioda more effort and struggle at the next level. We also have high expectations for Captain Matsumoto.</p>
<p>Nationwide Japanese Fighting Spirit Soars</p>
<p>I went to Tokyo in late January and would like to share what I heard and saw: I had not returned to Japan for a long period of one year and three months. This time, I saw a Japan in a state of pure decisive battle. One hundred million people were extremely excited, with a special attack spirit. Although the Japanese people have repeatedly suffered enemy B-29 bombing raids, their fighting spirit is soaring and has not been frustrated in the slightest. Even the most revered Ise Grand Shrine was affected, which has further galvanized the Japanese people's fighting spirit. Recently, the political system for decisive battles has been completed, as can be seen in the parliamentary Q&amp;A. Secondly, what is most noteworthy is that although the enemy has tried hard to promote the air control of Japan, no damage has been seen in Tokyo and other cities. What is even more noteworthy is that in the cities, whether it is residences, shops, or factories, due to evacuation measures, there is a slightly desolate appearance, but the people running on the road are all lively and energetic, advancing to complete their tasks. In the past 2,600 years of Japanese history, it has never been invaded by foreign enemies. Although it has now suffered bombing, the general public is not confused at all and is extremely calm. This kind of vitality is also true of women and children, and they feel lonely when there are no air raids.</p>
<p>Astonishing Achievements in Increased Production</p>
<p>Furthermore, what I was most worried about before was the production problem. Having seen and heard it, I learned that the production side, although repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft, has not been affected in the slightest. The reason for this is that the Japanese air force's interception is effective, the air defense equipment is perfect, and the handling of incendiary bombs is thorough. The production ratio from last December to this March is cleverly shown. At the same time, Japan's material distribution method is complete, the neighborhood association organization is perfect, and to the general public. What is most appreciated is that the general male and female students are all diligent in public service, with the spirit of reaching victory. Even the general public has a firm will to win the war and overcome any difficulties.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Tactics Cause Enemy to Bleed</p>
<p>Regarding the Philippine battle situation, the enemy is using every means to attempt to attack Manila, but in fact, the fate of the Philippines is not in the Manila battle. Japanese tactics are to force the enemy to bleed more. Now, the Great East Asia War has undergone changes in its mode of operation compared to the past. Whether in terms of time or location, it is different from the past. General Yamashita once said: The enemy also has questions about this operation. On January 9, San Francisco radio referred to me, saying that the most optimistic Colonel Matsushima said that the US attack on the Philippines would cut off Japan's southern resources. I am not talented, but I am very honored to have been noticed by the American radio station. I have never made such a statement, so I am even more grateful for their broadcast.</p>
<p>Southern Route Unaffected</p>
<p>Now, the Japanese-American operations are both attrition warfare. Even if the Philippine operation cuts off southern resources, Japan has long been prepared and has combat power. What I saw on this trip is that if southern resources are cut off, what Japan will feel lacking is aluminum raw materials, but Japan has already prepared substitutes and it will have no impact. The enemy propaganda says that Rabaul Island has been completely cut off, but there are still many Japanese troops there. The Japanese army has the power of autonomy and self-reliance. Although it is difficult to predict how the war situation will develop in the future, the Japanese operations will definitely lure the enemy to a close range and destroy them. This policy will never change.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Brutally Strafe Civilian Ships</p>
<p>Then, Captain Shioda said: Regarding the inhumanity of the American military, it has been shown repeatedly in the past. Recently, it has even indiscriminately bombed Chinese civilian ships that are completely defenseless. On January 16, a ship of the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company carrying 240 passengers was sailing upstream on the Yangtze River. Four enemy aircraft discovered that the ship had no equipment and that all those on board were civilians, and they carried out indiscriminate bombing and machine gun strafing. According to the captain of the ship: At about 2:00 PM on the 16th, four enemy aircraft were discovered at an altitude of 2,000 meters. Shortly afterwards, the aircraft descended to a low altitude of 100 meters. The captain took contingency measures, but the passengers were unable to escape. After thirty minutes of repeated machine gun strafing, 34 passengers were killed and 45 were injured. Originally, there is a distinction between combatants and non-combatants in warfare. Japanese military operations have always made this distinction on moral grounds, but the United States is not the same. They found that the people on board were civilians, but they thought it was a good opportunity and did not hesitate to take brutal measures. All the injured passengers were Chinese. Like the blind bombing of Hankou and Shanghai, they are all inhuman tramplings. In the future, the American enemy will probably continue to do so. I remember that a hundred years ago, an American ship called the Australia transported thousands of Chinese from Shanghai to the United States, and all of them died in their hands. The inhumanity of the United States is a consistent style in its history. Japan and China must cooperate closely to crush this brutal enemy wearing a human mask. Finally, he expressed unlimited regret for the 79 victims and their families.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e7">Significance and Impact of Connecting the Canton-Hankou Railway <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>On December 10th of last year, Japanese troops in China and troops in Vietnam met at the Sino-Vietnamese border, opening up the international continental route. Since then, the north-south longitudinal line of the East Asian continent, except for a small section of the Canton-Hankou Railway centered on Shaoguan, has been completely opened. Recently, Japanese troops in Hunan and Guangdong continued to advance, and the Japanese troops from the north and south met between Lechang and Shaoguan on January 27th. From then on, the continental longitudinal line was unblocked.</p>
<p>This operation shows the strength of the Japanese forces. Although the Japanese army in the Philippines must use elite and large forces to resist the US air, land, and sea offensives, it can still continue to advance in mainland China with rapid and powerful momentum, and continue to obtain great results.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it increasingly exposes the fragility of the Chongqing army. This operation was launched at the beginning of January, and by the middle of January, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack, completing a major mission in just ten days. The junction of Hunan and Guangdong along the Canton-Hankou Railway has many steep mountain roads and is said to be guarded by natural dangers, but now it is unable to defend it. It is also said that when the Chongqing army retreated, important military facilities and transportation equipment, such as tunnels and bridges between Yuechang and Baishi, were not destroyed, which shows how panicked they were.</p>
<p>After the Canton-Hankou Railway is completely opened, it will have a great effect on the Japanese army, whether for continental operations or for the war against the US in the islands. In the future, the mobilization of Japanese troops in the north and south and the transportation of supplies will be more convenient, and the relationship between the ocean and the mainland can be more closely connected. The enemy's attempt to contain the Japanese army in mainland China has repeatedly failed. At present, the Japanese army not only opened up the Canton-Hankou Railway, but also captured the important places of Haifeng and Lufeng near the South China Sea southeast of Guangzhou via Huizhou, and controlled the coastal areas of Guangdong Province, giving the enemy's delusion of landing on the coast of South China a head-on blow. The Japanese army took the lead, and if the enemy dares to commit an offense against the coast, they will surely suffer a painful annihilation. Therefore, the battle of the Canton-Hankou Railway is helpful to the Japanese army's operations in the Philippines and is extremely huge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Japanese army also occupied Suichuan in the southwest and is advancing towards Ganzhou. Suichuan and Ganzhou are important air force bases for the US in China. Most of the enemy aircraft that attacked central and southern China came from the airfields of these bases. This is obviously a great blow to the enemy's air guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>Looking at the results of the Japanese army's battle, it can be proved that the strongholds needed by the Japanese army in terms of strategy have the power to be in hand at any time. At the same time, the operation to open up the Canton-Hankou Railway was not only to attack Chongqing, but more actively to prevent the enemy's landing attempt and fulfill the responsibility of defending East Asia.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the urgency of the European war and the tension of the Philippine operations, the public's attention has been focused on this. Therefore, those who are good at creating rumors and causing trouble have the opportunity to spread rumors. With the success of the Japanese army's continental operations again, it can shift the public attention and break the rumors of the rumor mongers.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Minister of Justice Wu Discusses Administrative Policy: Determined to Do His Best to Abolish Extraterritoriality <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The new Minister of Judicial Administration, Wu Songgao, met with Chinese and foreign reporters at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to report on his administrative plans after taking office. His original words are as follows:</p>
<p>This time, I was ordered to be transferred to be the head of the judiciary, but I firmly declined, but I took office in the ministry yesterday. I am a man of few words, and I only want to say to the people in this ministry my hopes: I have always been serving the Party and the country with all my might as my tenet. Before, I was sent to receive various concessions and plan the unification of the Shanghai municipality and other work. I only thought that I would do my best in this area to benefit both the country and the people. The relationship between the judiciary and the people is even closer. If the court's judgment is not fair and the prison management is not perfect, directly or indirectly, it will increase the suffering of the people. In the future, I will follow my original intention and, based on the current environment, try to improve the judicial administration to reduce the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>Gradually abolishing unequal treaties to strive for China's freedom and equality is what the Founding Father showed us. In recent years, with the painstaking efforts of the late Chairman Wang and Acting Chairman Chen and the central authorities, and with the help of allies in good faith, the concessions of various countries in China have been gradually recovered. What is now most urgent to prepare for is the abolition of extraterritoriality. There are more than one reasons why this kind of unequal treaty can still exist in our country, but the imperfection of our country's judicial system, the foreigner in order to make an excuse, is one of the reasons. At present, the Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality in China has been established, and all affairs will be actively carried out. I happen to be taking over the law at this time, and I will make my best efforts in all aspects so that all preparations for the abolition of extraterritoriality can be twice the result with half the effort. I feel that my personal ability is weak, and the responsibility is not light. I still hope that all the wise men and leaders of the legal community will give me guidance at any time so that I can complete my mission as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Tokyo, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Regarding the United States' mediation for compromise with the Chinese Communists, in addition to harboring certain political ambitions, it also seeks to interfere in Chongqing's internal affairs. On the other hand, based on its war against Japan, it also feels the need to realize this quickly. The U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, due to the loss of bases in Central and South China in the second half of last year, urgently seeks to replenish them and must start base construction. Thus, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists has become an indispensable prerequisite. According to recent news from Beijing, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing has recently set up three bases in Lanzhou, and is also preparing to set up bases in Ningxia Province. As this work becomes increasingly acute, the United States' pressure on Chongqing is bound to increase.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Domestic Briefs <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Hankou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Since last year, the Hubei Provincial Government has decided on a rural production increase plan in order to vigorously launch a production increase campaign. The original production increase committee was reorganized, and officials with Sino-Japanese military ties reorganized it into the highest planning agency for rural production for both China and Japan. The adjusted personnel of the committee are recorded as follows: The chairman is concurrently held by the governor of the province, and the standing committee members are concurrently held by the director of the Department of Political Affairs, the director of the Department of Construction, the mayor of Hankou, and the consultant stationed in Hankou of the Maeda Economic Committee.</p>
<p>Suzhou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: The U.S. planes stationed in Chongqing bombed the Pukou area, which recently suffered heavy losses. Many people were killed and injured. Governor Ren allocated 1 million yuan to relieve the refugees in the area and ordered Cao Chongsan, the magistrate of Jiangpu County, to distribute it properly.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Japanese Planes Bomb Zhijiang Enemy Airfield, Destroying Ten Planes <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Continental Base, February 1st, Central News Agency: Japanese bombing units took advantage of the adverse weather to attack the advanced base of the enemy's U.S. Air Force at Zhijiang Airport. Despite the interception by enemy fighter planes and intense anti-aircraft fire, all bombs hit the target, burning three unidentified aircraft, one large aircraft, and one small aircraft, and destroying five aircraft. The Japanese returned safely.</p>
<p>Continental Battlefield Becomes Fortress</p>
<p>Hunan Front Line, February 1st, Central News Agency: The opening of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway has now been completed. The last base of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, Suichuan, was occupied by the Japanese army on the 8th. The results of this operation are as follows: (1) The division of the third, fourth, and ninth war zones. (2) The entire Yuehan Railway between Hankou and Guangzhou was opened. (3) The Suichuan-Ganzhou base cluster, the last base of the U.S. Air Force in southeastern China, is now completely occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's continental north-south operation has completely occupied southeastern China. According to reports, the third and seventh war zones, and a part of the fourth and ninth war zones, are corridors of the seventh war zone and the common front of Yu Hanmou, Gu Zhutong, and Xue Yue. The purpose of these generals was to coordinate with the Chongqing army in southwestern China, with He Yingqin as the new commander in Xinde, and to attack from both the front and the rear, and cut off the Japanese army's continental north-south route. However, after the end of this operation, these internal and external war zones of the Chongqing army have been completely divided, so the Chongqing army's plan has also been shattered. This time, due to the rapid operation of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army did not have time to destroy the railway tracks and iron bridges of the Yuehan Railway, and completely occupied them. At this point, when the construction of the northern section of the Yuehan Railway between Hankou and Hengyang is completed, the opening of the Yuehan Railway can be expected in the near future.</p>
<p>In addition, the Suichuan-Ganzhou base cluster, centered on Suichuan and Ganzhou, is the last base of the U.S. Air Force in southeastern China. The enemy army used this to bomb the airfield in the Japanese-occupied area and the navigation routes in the East China Sea, and tried to block them. Now, due to the loss of Suichuan, the strength of the Suichuan-Ganzhou base cluster has been reduced by half, and the remaining base clusters are under the threat of the Japanese army and it is difficult to exert their power. Now, the Guangzhou-Hong Kong area is connected to Hengyang, and the key points along the coast of South China are also connected to the Japanese army's line of operation that runs through the center of the mainland. Therefore, even if the enemy army touches the mainland, the Japanese army can exert the power of the continental artery between Korea, Manchuria, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, and annihilate them. This operation can be said to be the result of the Japanese army's offensive operation in the past four months. At this point, the goal of continental fortification has been completed.</p>
<p>Japanese Army's Operations Become More Active</p>
<p>Guangzhou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: The Japanese army's opening of the Yuehan Railway this time is a major stage since the Greater East Asia War. The Yuehan Railway area, which runs through Hunan and Hubei, is a major producer of rice, peanuts, wheat, tung oil, and tungsten coal in terms of materials, and the yield is extremely rich, becoming a source for cultivating the anti-Japanese strength of Chongqing in South China. The 980-odd kilometers of the railway had been heavily attacked by the Japanese army. They have occupied 630 kilometers, and the remaining 350 kilometers have completely lost their transportation capacity under the fierce bombing of Japanese planes. The only remaining part is from south of Chen County to Yingde in Guangdong Province. Since the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing has connected the Yuehan Railway with the Henggui branch line for 10 kilometers eastward, and intersected with the Guiyang line on the south bank of the Qin-Gui line and the two major highways of Longzhou, Nanning, and Guilin, forming a southwestern construction common station line. However, at present, the Yuehan Railway from Hankou, through the key points of Changsha, Hengyang, and Shaoguan, to Guangzhou, has been completely opened, and it is connected to the Pinghan Railway. The great railway running through mainland China will become a favorable transportation route for the Japanese army, and the past major artery of Chongqing's resistance has now been completely severed. The Japanese army uses this major artery to increase its active forces in this operation.</p>
<p>Japanese Commando Teams Endure Hardships</p>
<p>Hunan Front Line, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Since the main force of the Japanese army began operations in the southern section of the Yuehan Railway this time, its southward advance team reached Lechang in just five days, broke into the famous Dayu Ling Mountains, and suppressed the natural barrier between Baishi and Lechang. During this period, they waded through ten bridges and tunnels on the railway for ten kilometers. Their activity is admirable. The easternmost part of the Xiang-Yue border to the highest peak of the Dayu Ling Mountains, a steep mountain of 1,200 meters, constitutes the difficult pass of about 30 kilometers between Baishi and Lechang. Passing through five tunnels and bridges in the Yuehan Railway required enormous labor and materials, and it took considerable months to build successfully. Therefore, the Japanese army in this southern operation was indeed painstaking. The Chongqing army tried its best to ensure these bridges and tunnels before destroying them, while the Japanese southward advance team secretly carried out special training, cut off the Chongqing army's retreat with several commando teams, and in order to ensure the bridges and tunnels, they first began the operation, and gradually decided to sneak in, and cleverly broke through the Chongqing army's heavy surveillance, and endured the hardships of the dangerous mountain roads. Nineteen days after half a month, they began to be active with the Baishi-Lechang Railway as the target. The commando teams, like in a no man's land, suddenly secured ten bridges and tunnels in turn. Therefore, this heroic and arduous spirit is the key to determining the success of this operation to open up the Yuehan Railway.</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Focus of the Eastern Front Shifts to the Warta River Bend; Soviet Pioneers Reach Küstrin <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Haitong Agency reported: Although the fighting southwest of Hongdu was fierce in 24 hours, there was no change. The Soviet offensive in the south has not slowed down, and the main goal is within the Upper Silesian industrial area. The Soviet army from Rybnik to Glogau is approaching the Warta River, and the Soviet vanguard is attempting to cross the river at several points, which the German army is resisting. There is no particularly important military development in East Prussia, and the German army is still in an active position. The German army has established a corridor west of Königsberg, so that the garrison in this area can make contact with the German army elsewhere in East Prussia, and the Soviet army is attempting to close this corridor. General Sukhov's troops have the ambition to break through the German defense line and directly approach Berlin. The fighting in this area has attracted worldwide attention. The Soviet commander also knows that going deep alone is risky. The battle of Posen is still fierce. The Soviet vanguard has crossed the Obra River a few days ago, and recently tank formations and strong infantry forces have also crossed the river westward to assist the vanguard in fighting in Sulechów, Świebodzin, Międzyrzecz, and Schwiebus. Therefore, the main battlefield between the Soviet army and the German army defending the border has shifted westward to the center of the Warta River and Warthe River bend. There should be a large-scale battle in this area at present. On the Netze River front, there is also military action between Friedeberg and Schneidemühl. Schneidemühl is still in the hands of the German army. The Soviet vanguard passed through this city and rushed into the Deutsch Krone district, but has been blocked. The Soviet army, which has crossed the Netze River, immediately moved westward after crossing the river, has rushed past Landsberg and entered the Neumark district. The Soviet light troops have reached the Soldin-Küstrin (Küstrin is north of Frankfurt) line. The mission of the Soviet army north of the Netze River is obviously to protect the troops fighting in the Warta River and Warthe River bend. We can see the importance of this situation by opening the map. From a careful observation of the Soviet commanders' actions, we know that the Soviet general is already considering that the German army is about to launch a large-scale counter-offensive.</p>
<p>East Prussian War Intensifies</p>
<p>Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: German Agency reported that a German military spokesman claimed on Thursday that the Soviet army in East Prussia has reduced the German front line again. The Soviet army is currently attempting to advance towards Pillau, the main entrance to the Königsberg harbor. Fierce fighting is taking place there.</p>
<p>Pomeranian Front Stabilized</p>
<p>Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Haitong Agency reported: The mountainous roads of Bohemia-Moravia have been cleared of snow, and military transportation has become smoother. A large number of troops and supplies of heavy weapons are being rapidly reinforced to the Silesian front, so the Soviet bridgehead on the west bank of the Warta River has been unable to expand. The most important of the bridgeheads, such as a part of the German armored forces fighting east of the Warta River, has now been transferred to the west bank of the river to assist in the battle. There are now four or five divisions of German infantry gathered there, and it seems impossible for the Soviet army to cut off the traffic between Silesia and the north. In addition, the bridgehead in Steinau and the bridgehead in Ohlau are tasked with surrounding Breslau. The Soviet army has specially transferred the 3rd Tank Army east of the forest near Rothenburg and Kosel north to assist the former two bridgeheads, which shows their importance to these two places. The Soviet army gathered on both banks of the upper reaches of the Warta River also has thirty-five infantry divisions and two tank battalions, preparing to enter Moravia. On the one hand, the German army is also rapidly reinforcing to protect the industrial center, and it is expected that the Soviet army's attack will be severely damaged.</p>

<p>Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: German Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels, in the latest issue of the "National Weekly", strongly stated the fact of the European crisis, and demanded that the people resolve to resist, the main points of which are as follows: Europe, the political heart of the world, has been forced into a difficult stage before Stalin's offensive. Eastern Europe must not hesitate for a moment. At present, the only one who can confront the material strength of red anarchy is Germany. If Europe does not save itself, it will have to let communism do whatever it wants. The European war situation has reached the most dangerous stage. If we want to save the European crisis, we have to fight to the death.</p>

<p>Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Haitong Agency reported: The eyes of the world are now focused on Berlin, which is approaching the front line. This city of millions of residents is now preparing for war. I toured Berlin for a week in the underground tunnel and witnessed an endless stream of workers rushing to the factories in the underground transportation center. In front of a large factory, there were 10,000 workers waiting for shifts to leave the factory to rest and work in the factory. The two teams were silent. At noon, I arrived in the commercial center and saw the department stores still busy, and people were watching the price list in front of the restaurants. There were also many people watching the newspaper in front of the newspaper office. The headline of the newspaper was that the war had entered the Brandenburg Province. Berlin is still outside the main front and no artillery fire can be heard. The pilot still has 70 kilometers to reach the eastern front, but he feels that he is approaching the front line more and more. The roads leading to the east are all armored forces, and troops and supply teams are also gathered in the transportation center. The police on duty are wearing helmets and carrying guns, and the strength of the city's defense is strengthened. The people of Berlin all go to the suburbs to serve as members of the people's assault team. Important bases outside the regiment are also building fortifications. Trenches are being built around Berlin. Those who have not gone to participate in the people's assault team are being trained to use machine guns, etc. Everyone is determined to make every house a fortress, ready for a bloody battle. However, there is still no barbed wire set up in the city, which shows that the military leaders believe that the Soviet army has no intention of breaking into the city. Most foreign civilians and prisoners of war can still come and go freely in the city without restrictions, and there is no panic.</p>

<p>Rumor of Announcement regarding Germany</p>
<p>Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: German Agency reported: A foreign news agency close to German officials recently published an article saying that it is rumored that Roosevelt and Churchill will issue a declaration to the German people at the meeting. Although the declaration will require unconditional surrender, the conditions of this condition will be deleted, and its explanation will be more detailed. The German side has long expected this move. If it comes true, it is only because the British and Americans have greatly criticized the unconditional surrender and said that it is a serious mistake that will cost the anti-Axis countries millions of soldiers. The British and Americans changed their attitude in order to save the blood of their own soldiers. The declaration may say that the anti-Axis countries will only destroy the National Socialist Party and not the Germans, but no matter what its content is, the attitude of the Germans will never change.</p>

<h3 id="e22">General Situation of Zhoupu (Part Two) <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Industry</p>
<p>The industry in Zhoupu is well-developed, comparable to Datuan. The majority of the factories are cotton mills, weaving mills, flour mills, rice milling plants, and oil mills. The largest cotton mill is the Lifeng Cotton Mill in Zhoupu town, with a capital of 13,000,000 yuan. It has 2,000 spindles. The machinery was originally owned by the former Wing On Cotton Mill in Shanghai. Its products bear the "Sailing Boat" brand and are sold in Shanghai and rural areas. The Mao Xin Cotton Mill has a capital of 50,000,000 yuan and 800 spindles. Other smaller cotton mills, such as Daxin, Tongxin, and Hexin, which is about to be established, are mostly concentrated in Jimin Town, about 18 li from Zhoupu. In addition to cotton mills, the town also has Zhong Wanyuan and Qia Xing Flour Mills, and Xianglongsheng Oil Pressing Plant. The town is full of factories and is known as "Little Wuxi," which it truly deserves. In Zhoupu, there are flour mills such as Liji, Yuanfenghing, and Gonghe. The He Feng Dyeing and Weaving Factory is a weaving mill. The large and magnificent Dahua Match Factory is also located in the area.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>The development of education in Zhoupu is largely due to the efforts of the current district head, Wu Xianhe. Mr. Wu is a local and has been serving in the education sector for many years. Currently, in addition to serving as the district head and principal of the No. 2 Middle School of the County, he also serves as the manager of rice shops and money shops. He spares no effort in promoting education and was the first to advocate a semi-compulsory, completely free enrollment policy for school-age children. His enthusiasm for education is admirable.</p>
<p>Zhoupu currently has three middle schools: the No. 2 Middle School of the County and the private Shihua and Yaguang. The No. 2 Middle School and its affiliated elementary school have specially built school buildings, located near Zhoupu Park, with a beautiful and ideal environment. There are a total of fifty-three elementary schools in the district, with county-run schools accounting for two-thirds.</p>
<p>From this semester onward, all public, private, elementary, and middle schools in Zhoupu will be exempt from tuition and fees, and the heads of each township will be responsible for supervising the enrollment of school-age children. At the same time, to ensure that teachers can teach with peace of mind, their salaries will be increased. In addition to their stipends, each teacher will be given five to one dan of rice per month (based on the amount of coursework they handle). Under the supervision of the district head, staff from the Civil Affairs Section will visit various locations once a month to inspect. Teachers with excellent performance will be rewarded separately.</p>
<p>According to District Head Wu, after the newly established measures are implemented, the total office expenses for each school will require a subsidy of more than 100,000 yuan per semester. The cost of rice for teachers will be 700 dan per semester. The source of funding for the former subsidy will be from a new "Educational Brokerage Fee" (i.e., when land is bought and sold, the district office will collect a fee of 2% of the sale price from the buyer as the "Educational Brokerage Fee") to make up for the deficit. As for the rice for the students, the heads of each township will be responsible for raising it from wealthy gentry and merchants, with each bao contributing approximately three dan every six months according to the current budget. After the rice is raised, the local township and bao leaders, together with local gentry and school representatives, will form a management committee to be responsible for its safekeeping and distribution to the schools on a monthly basis. This method is very good, with very little corruption, and is worthy of promotion.</p>
<p>The qualification review of teachers was also implemented on January 28 to eliminate teachers with inadequate qualifications and prevent them from continuing to delay the future of students. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e23">Chairman Chen of the Rice Control Association Discusses the Current State of Procurement Work: Efforts to Break Through Difficulties and Maintain the City's Food Supply <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of his tenure, Mayor Zhou repeatedly expressed his determination to improve the people's livelihood in the city. In particular, he actively sought to smooth the source of rice and grain. At the same time, in order to first stabilize the lives of civil servants and journalists, he specially included them in the key distribution list, expressing his best efforts to solve the overall livelihood of the citizens in the short term. Seeing that the municipal government had expressed its determination to maintain the people's food supply, but that the source of rice and grain still depended on the assistance of the Rice Control Association, the reporter interviewed Chairman Chen of the Rice Control Association to understand the progress of the association's procurement of rice and grain, and how it would cooperate with the municipal government to stabilize the people's livelihood in the future. The following is Chairman Chen's response:</p>
<p>Current Status of Procurement Work</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the current status of the association's rice and grain procurement work, January and February are the peak procurement season. Therefore, in order to actively promote the procurement work, most of our staff have been dispatched to various rice-producing areas to assist in the work. With the cooperation of the Allied Self-Defense Forces, the procurement of rice and grain should be completed as scheduled, and transported to Shanghai to ensure the food supply for the people. This is the current status of the procurement work. However, there are currently three difficulties that prevent the city's rice supply from being opened up in the short term. (1) The gold problem was the prerequisite for purchasing rice and grain. The association has been working hard to plan for this matter. Currently, this problem has been solved. With sufficient funds, the progress of rice and grain procurement will naturally not be a problem. (2) Transportation problems. In the past, the association's rice and grain transportation to Shanghai relied entirely on inland waterway ships. Recently, due to the arrival of winter and the severe cold weather, the rivers have frozen, and ships cannot pass, thus hindering the arrival of rice and grain in Shanghai. However, this is a seasonal problem and will soon be restored. (3) Public security problems. Due to the poor public security in the rural areas, the transportation of rice and grain from several rice-producing areas has encountered difficulties, and it is impossible to transport them to Shanghai continuously. The above points are the main reasons hindering the transportation of rice and grain to Shanghai. However, the association is currently working on solutions to these difficulties and will solve them in the short term. (2) As for the municipal government's determination to increase the amount of rationed rice, the association's only cooperation is to actively increase the source of rice and grain. With Mayor Zhou's decision, we will do our best in our position to ensure that supply and demand are equal.</p>
<p>Household Rice and Grain Can Be Distributed</p>
<p>(3) The reason why household rice has not been distributed for a long time is because the distribution agency has recently been replaced. The new authorities are engaged in internal reorganization, which has slightly delayed the date. The association has long prepared the rice and grain, so it will be distributed as scheduled. (4) Regarding suppressing rice prices, the municipal government has expressed its determination, but this problem depends on the cooperation of the entire city's citizens to be effective. The association actively smooths the source of rice and grain and maintains the distribution of household rice and grain as scheduled. After the food supply is solved, no one will be interested in black market rice and grain, and the drop in black market rice prices is inevitable. However, the food supply in Central China has not been sufficient in the past and has relied on Siam rice from abroad. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, foreign transportation has been cut off, but the consumption quantity is still the same as before. In addition, the rural areas have had poor harvests in recent years, and the lack of rice and grain is inevitable. In the past, the government authorities launched a flour movement to encourage people to supplement with flour in order to remedy this defect. This movement has long been implemented in North China, so the food panic in that area has been resolved in recent years. The people in the southern regions of the Yangtze River have not been able to follow suit, so the rice and grain shortage still cannot be resolved. In addition, some merchants in the city have taken the opportunity to hoard, and the original grain transported to Shanghai for supply has been manipulated, making it impossible to universally supply the market. This point is the main reason for the high rice prices. Therefore, my opinion is that suppressing rice prices depends on the cooperation of all parties in the private sector to achieve the ideal work.</p>

<p>In order to improve the treatment of police officers, the Shanghai Police Bureau has decided to implement the free distribution of police rice to national police officers starting in February. In order to ensure the accuracy of the number of people and prevent fraudulent claims, the following three measures have been stipulated to ensure the proper use of public funds. (1) The current number of personnel will be divided into three categories: (Category A) Married with children, (Category B) Married, and (Category C) Unmarried. The forms will be filled out and submitted within three days of the order. It is stipulated that part-time personnel may not receive it concurrently. The number of personnel should be indicated if there is a part-time job. (2) The Supervisory Office will send officers to various branches and teams to conduct a careful count and verification. It must be submitted within one week, paying particular attention to the following two points: (1) Whether there are part-time personnel claiming police rice under aliases, (2) A thorough count and verification must be conducted, and no perfunctory favoritism is allowed. (3) If the responsible officials report inaccurately or the personnel sent by the Bureau engage in favoritism or perfunctory behavior, they will be severely punished according to the law.</p>

<p>In order to conserve electricity, the Shanghai Urban Transportation Company has temporarily changed the tram operating hours to two shifts, morning and evening. After all trams and trolley buses stop running from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., most citizens hire rickshaws or pedicabs for transportation. Therefore, the business of rickshaws in the city has benefited several times over. In particular, rickshaws soliciting business on busy streets are not only violating regulations but also obstructing traffic. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities issued a notice to all rickshaw companies yesterday, strictly prohibiting soliciting business and requiring them to comply with the rickshaw rental price approved by the authorities on January 16, which is 300 yuan for a minimum of 30 minutes, plus 50 yuan for every 5 minutes thereafter, and 600 yuan per hour. If there is any extra demand, citizens can report it at any time, and the authorities will deal with it severely.</p>

<p>Saving on Farewell Tea Party to Support Education</p>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Welfare Fund of the China Film Company wrote in a letter: "Our company originally planned to hold a farewell dinner party for former General Manager Feng Rong's new position. However, in accordance with the wishes of former General Manager Feng to save money to donate to your newspaper's education fund and to care about the welfare of our company's colleagues, we changed to holding a simple tea party in the film production department's auditorium. After deducting expenses, a total of 121,318 yuan was saved. According to the original intention of former General Manager Feng, 3/4 of the funds will be allocated to our company's welfare fund, and the remaining 1/4, totaling 30,329.50 yuan, will be donated to your newspaper's education fund to benefit poor students.

<p>Mediation Compensation Allocated to Subsidy Fund</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Chenglin, director of the 7th district of the Shanghai Special City Rice Retail Office, and Mr. Ye Shuxiong, director of the 8th district, wrote in a letter: "Some time ago, we mediated a dispute between the Luofuji Transportation Company and the Wanxingming Rice Shop over transportation matters. Wanxingming expressed forgiveness, etc. Afterwards, Luofuji sent a thank-you banquet worth 40,000 yuan in China Reserve Certificates as a token of gratitude. We believe that mediation is a matter of friendship and should not think of rewards. In addition, at a time when frugality is valued, there should be no unnecessary waste. We firmly refused to accept it. We have decided to allocate the entire amount to the Xinwen and Shenbao subsidy funds to benefit the above two parties. Enclosed is a check for 20,000 yuan in China Reserve Certificates. Please accept it on our behalf."</p>

Jilin is known for its spirit of Bushido and has also performed well in Group A, especially their 8-0 victory over Wendu, which is considered their masterpiece. Therefore, although Lianyi is likely to win, it must also guard against an upset.

<h3 id="e32">Several Things That Should Be Implemented Amidst the Advocacy for Thrift <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the difficulty of obtaining materials and the exhaustion of people's livelihoods, the call for thrift has permeated society. On the government side, the Ministry of Social Welfare is advocating from above, and among the people, there is also the establishment of the Shanghai Citizens' Thrift Association, with celebrities speaking out and newspapers promoting it tirelessly. However, upon careful examination of the reality, it is found that those who are truly practicing thrift are none other than the general wage-earning class whose purchasing power has fallen to the brink of starvation. These people, without the persuasion of others, have already cut back to the point where they can no longer cut back any further. On the other hand, observing those merchants who have obtained war profiteering, they continue to be extravagant and unrestrained in their spending, never even thinking about conserving resources. This phenomenon urgently requires social leaders to take it as their responsibility to change customs and habits, to lead by example with practical action, and not to engage in empty talk. The spirit of the thrifty arrangements made by Mr. Wen Lanting when he married his granddaughter-in-law on the 24th of last month, is perhaps close to this ideal.</p>
<p>We believe that advocating for thrift measures that are too lofty will be difficult to achieve real results. Here, we propose a few practical and easily implementable examples, hoping that everyone will actively promote them.</p>
<p>It is often seen that when a family experiences a bereavement, they often publish obituary advertisements in the initial days of mourning or send out obituary notices everywhere. As a result, relatives and friends have no choice but to spend money on transportation to attend the funeral and offer condolences. When the "Fifth Seventh Day" memorial service (35th day after death) arrives, they even more grandly publish advertisements in the newspaper a few days in advance and send out obituaries everywhere, causing relatives and friends to spend money again. This kind of double expenditure of money and time is too far from the principle of thrift and should be urgently reformed.</p>
<p>We propose that in the future, when a member of society unfortunately experiences a bereavement, if an obituary has already been published or obituary notices have been widely distributed at the time of the initial mourning, there should not be the issue of sending out obituaries and holding a memorial service on the "Fifth Seventh Day". If the memorial service is deemed important, then there is no need to widely announce the bereavement at the beginning, so as to avoid relatives and friends making multiple trips, wasting time and money. On the part of the notified relatives and friends, if they have already attended the wake and given gifts during the initial mourning, then there is no need to attend the "Fifth Seventh Day" memorial service.</p>
<p>2.  The Lunar New Year has been abolished for a long time, but social habits are difficult to change. In the past few years, even during wartime, the old custom of New Year visits still persisted. At present, transportation costs are high, and even a short journey costs one or two hundred yuan. The "tea money" (tip) alone, at each household, cannot be less than one hundred yuan. If, within the four days of the Lunar New Year, an average person visits ten relatives and friends for New Year visits, then each person must spend at least three thousand yuan. Moreover, according to custom, etiquette requires reciprocity. If relatives and friends of similar status come to visit you, you should return the visit. Therefore, statistically, the amount of waste generated for the sake of New Year visits within these four days must be shockingly large. Furthermore, based on usual observations, those who go out to pay New Year visits are mostly those who seek favors from others. These people mostly live on their salaries and are already very difficult in ordinary times. How can they afford this extra expenditure?</p>
<p>We propose that this year, the bad habit of New Year visits should be thoroughly eliminated so that the general middle class can ease their burden slightly and take advantage of this early spring holiday to allow these people, who are busy all year round, to rest a little. The implementation of this matter hinges on the senior staff of various organizations and factories taking the lead in advocating and clearly showing their subordinates and relatives and friends their determination to abolish New Year visits this year, so as to lead by example, so that subordinates and those who seek favors from me do not have the hidden concern that not paying New Year visits will affect their prospects. The Shanghai Citizens' Thrift Association should also loudly appeal and actively advocate for practical results.</p>
<p>In addition, giving New Year gifts among relatives and friends at the end of the lunar year, holding birthday celebrations for people who have long passed away, holding memorial services for deceased relatives, or actions that are close to madness or wasting time and money are all not in line with the principle of thrift, and these should be strongly eliminated without further ado.</p>
<h3 id="e33">A Visit to the Shanghai Poor Children's Home <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Poor Children's Home," which has a history of more than thirty years in Shanghai society, has long been known to the reporter for its spirit of hard work and practical action. The reporter took time out the other day to visit and learned that Mr. Chen Zhongfu, the director of the home, and others have worked hard in recent years to maintain the home. However, in such a serious period of social malaise, it is truly fortunate that poor children can enjoy the happiness of both education and care in such a paradise.</p>
<p>The address of the home is on Jumen Road in Nanshi. Opposite it is the Qu Zhenren Temple. The home's foundation has more than forty mu of land, which is rare in the urban society of Shanghai. Unfortunately, most of the home's buildings were destroyed during the recent incident, so now there are only ten or so rooms. The most noteworthy thing is that it has partnered with the financial community ××× and others to open a farm. There are dairy cows, bees, vegetable gardens, and nurseries. Students from the Department of Agriculture in their duties practice on this farm.</p>
<p>On that day, Director Wu of the home led me on a week-long tour of the home. I learned that the home, in its makeshift manner, has seven classrooms, two offices, and a total of four dormitories for students and teachers, and three kitchens, storage rooms, etc., which is a decent scale. Because it was during the winter vacation, I was unable to witness the actual teaching situation at each level.</p>
<p>At present, the home has more than 300 students in its primary school department. The home's affiliated students, that is, commuting students, not only do not pay tuition, but also have textbooks provided by the home. Therefore, the poor children living near the home benefit greatly. Mr. Wu said that the admission procedures for the home's students are universal. Families of any poor children can apply to the home, so the home's students are more numerous than those of other child welfare organizations. Mr. Wu also said that the home's method of teaching students focuses on "spiritual training" and "the combination of hand and mind." Therefore, graduates of the home are generally diligent and reliable in their service. For example, the Minhang Wanchang Soy Sauce Garden has employed four graduates as apprentices due to the excellence of their work.</p>
<p>The reporter also inquired about the home's organization and financial situation. According to Mr. Wu, the highest organization of the home is the board of directors. The board of directors elects two people to serve as the president and supervisor of the home to carry out the home's administrative work. Therefore, the home's affairs are equivalent to the board of directors being directly responsible. However, because the home's regular income consists of only more than 200 mu of land, the rent received in a year, as it stands now, is not enough to cover expenses for one month. Therefore, it can only seek assistance from society. Mr. Wu also said that the home was established in the first year of the Qing Xuantong era and has been in operation for 37 years. It has never publicly solicited donations. At present, due to the extremely high prices, the board of directors is truly struggling to cope and has no choice but to appeal to enthusiastic people in society. The reporter listened to Mr. Wu's words and also deeply agreed. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in society will generously offer their benevolent assistance and create blessings for orphans and the poor. This is truly an act of accumulating boundless merit!</p>
<p>It is also heard that the famous movie star Miss Li Lihua, in view of the importance of the home's work and the difficulty of its funding, has decided to personally perform Peking Opera on stage at the Golden Grand Theater on the 5th of this month, and has invited famous amateur and professional performers to join in the performance in order to do her utmost to raise funds. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion on the day of the charity performance! (Guang Wen)</p>

<p>(1) Mr. Yu Hongqing wrote in a letter: "Regarding, I, Yu Hongqing, am celebrating my 50th birthday.

<p>(2) Ms. Guan Guiwei, in view of the current high cost of living, the fact that general poor pregnant women are unable to obtain appropriate and reasonable obstetric care when they are about to give birth, which seriously affects the health of pregnant women and infants, specially generously donated 50,000 yuan to the maternity assistance fund of this office to help poor pregnant women and provide free obstetric care. Ms. Guan's enthusiasm is admirable, and we would like to express our gratitude on behalf of her.</p>

The above measures will be in effect from February 1st to the end of the month, limited to two people per day. A certificate from your office or a citizen's card is acceptable.

<p>Youth Association Opens Second Middle School The Youth Association Middle School at 599 Sichuan Road has added a second middle school. The total tuition and miscellaneous fees are only 4,000 yuan. The curriculum is exactly the same as that of general high and junior high schools. Graduates will be issued graduation certificates. It is now recruiting transfer students for grades 1 and 2 of junior high school and grades 1 and 2 of high school. Both boys and girls are accepted. The examination date is set for February 7th. Registration can be made at the school from now on, which is truly good news for students from families who are unable to afford the fees at present.</p>
<p>Changzhou Native Place Association Scholarship The Changzhou Shanghai Native Place Association is offering scholarships for poor students this spring for the third year. Due to the increase in tuition fees at various schools by four or five times, the number of applicants for scholarships has also increased, and the association's funds are severely insufficient. The association has temporarily borrowed funds for use. The association's board of directors has resolved to continue the fundraising methods of previous teams, with each team responsible for 200,000 yuan.</p>

<p>— Xiaobo</p>
<p>The meaning of "genius" is that a skill can be understood and mastered without deep learning, as if it were a congenital response, as if it were innate. This is originally a comparative statement. Some people may oppose this view, but in fact, there are indeed surprising miracles!</p>
<p>It is rare to hear of a child who is only six and a half years old being able to play the piano, but it is a miracle to be able to play more than 40 world-famous songs and compose his own music, which is unanimously praised by professional musicians. If it is said that this child has musical talent and is a divine intention, it would not be an exaggeration!</p>
<p>His name is Han Qiaozhi. His two older sisters, Meiling and Shafei, both play the piano well. He grew up in a family with a strong musical atmosphere. At the age of five, he stood beside his sister listening to the piano, reluctant to leave, as if he had understood something. After his sister finished playing and left, he sat on the piano stool and actually played a sonorous tune, which surprised his sister's music teacher. His little bag was already full of music pieces, and he was eagerly looking for an opportunity to express them. Later, the teacher taught him, and he quickly mastered it. On the day of his sixth birthday, his parents held a concert for him, and he played the piano on the spot, which even more surprised many musicians. Isn't this a genius?</p>
<p>Now, his parents want to use the child's power to help poor children and have decided to hold a piano charity concert at the Lanxin Theater on February 6th. Qiaozhi will be the main performer, and his two sisters will accompany him. The proceeds from the ticket sales will be entirely donated to children's welfare charities. This office is selling honorary tickets, which are divided into three types: 5,000 yuan, 3,000 yuan, and 1,000 yuan. We hope that ladies and gentlemen who love music, especially children and little sisters, will come and enjoy the performance. Everyone will be happy. Tickets can be purchased from this office or the social service section of the Xinwen Bao and Xin Zhongguo Bao newspapers.</p>
