<h3>中蘇雙方同意議定　延長蘇軍撤退期限</h3>
<p>國軍距瀋陽僅九十里</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶一日電〕關於蘇軍自東北撤退一事，茲據官方消息，中蘇兩國政府，經磋商後，業經同意，改訂以明年一月一日爲完成撤退之期。（原定本年十二月三日爲完成撒退之期）並聞此種改訂，在使中國赴東北接收人員，及中國政府軍隊，能於期前依照新定辦法，到達東北，執行其接收任務。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶一日電〕今日此間華方堅稱，蘇聯已同意中國空運部隊在長春與瀋陽兩地降陸，並准許中國空軍地面人員，立即前往上述兩地，佈置空運部隊降落事宜。彼等復稱蘇聯已同意中國陸上部隊，向瀋陽推進。據某一未證實之消息，國軍先頭部隊已進抵距瀋陽僅九十里之地點。傳蘇聯當局已肅淸長春飛機塲之共產黨軍隊與其他雜色部隊，該機場之無綫電台與其他要地，已恢復通訊。此問觀察家對於早日收復東九省之展望，雖因過去數日之發展而趨樂觀，然共產軍與國軍在華北廣泛地區之內爭情形，依然嚴重。</p>
<p>〔中國社天津一日電〕錦州國軍繼續前進中，該縣飛機塲已可使用，北寗路天津至秦皇島段，由護路部隊經常以鐵甲往來巡遲，已暢通無阻。秦皇島至楡關，以一鐵橋破壞未通，楡錦間則已恢復通車。</p>
<p>中蘇條約字義精神各國希望毋稍踰越</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶一日電〕中蘇協定有吾附帶條件，無從得知，但此舉在國內及國際具有重大意義，即蘇聯以東九省交與中央政府，而不交與中共是也。此項問題有利解決之後，美國新任大使馬歇爾將來在華之工作，顯將較易着手。此間官方對於外傳蘇聯要求之說，仍保持緘默。查此種讓步將使東北實際成爲共同管轄，不能不使其他各國嚴重關切，蓋各國顯然希望勿踰越中蘇條約之字義及精神。同時，東北接收大員，可望迅連重臨長春。中共一度以東北爲其囊中之物，今觀此項協定，必將大失所望。但中共必已有所風聞，因長春所有共軍部隊業已撤退，此舉是否徇蘇聯要求，不得而知。</p>
<h3>國軍首批空運隊　由北平起飛現已抵達長春</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶一日電〕關於接收及經營東北各鐵路事宜，雙方協議順利，現仍在繼續商談中，空運國軍部隊至長春之工作，正由東北行營副主任蕭延平將軍積極佈置。據悉。目下當局感覺技術人員不敷錄用，於接收及經營上殊多不便，故暫時擬借重美蘇技術人員，協助一切，對於東北原有之日本籍技工亦然。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶一日電〕東九省已有三省主席抵錦州，準備進行接收該三省行政機關。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶一日電〕東北保安副司令長樂華盛將軍，日內飛漢轉潯，因西南幹訓團奉令遷往星子縣廬山訓練團舊址，並將改爲中央復員訓練團，　長官特爲布署一切，然後即飛東北，指揮復員工作。又據舊金山廣播，國軍第一批空運部隊已由北平起飛，抵達長春。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平一日電〕遼寗省政府主席徐筬，率省政府人員，定日內赴錦州，隨軍前往瀋陽，辦理接收工作。</p>
<h3>在華一切待解決之工作　馬歇爾必有新指示　魏德邁在招待記者會上稱</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕魏德邁將軍，昨晨在建設大厦招待本市新聞界，由美新聞處鄧樹勛君任翻譯，會談約一句鐘。魏氏首稱：馬歇爾將軍來華工作，乃一幸運之選擇，吾人對此極表殷慰。蓋馬氏乃一敢作敢爲之人，對於軍事政治均有經騐，行事大公無私，而有判斷，甚得美國會之信任。馬氏於十日至兩週之內可到華任職。</p>
<p>對赫爾利聲明</p>
<p>關於赫爾利大使之聲明，魏氏未作批評，但稱：赫爾利大使與彼極爲合作，對於美國政策亦忠實執行，與魏氏極爲友好，僉信馬氏來華對於一切待解決之工作必有新指示。關於軍事代表團之組織詳情，美軍工作分數不足而不能回國之官兵之處置，及華北美海軍陸戰隊之撤退日期，均是依據美國政策，在馬氏抵華後即可有決定。</p>
<p>租借法案問題</p>
<p>其後魏氏與各記者討論以下各問題：（一）租借法案問題。（甲）美機在上海之分配法，不在租借法案之例。存在上海之美軍剩餘物資，將由剩餘物資淸理委會處理，駐華戰區司令部不負任何責任。美存機的七百架左右，上海昆明芷江各地均有。但多半集中在上海。（乙）剩餘物資均出賣，法方政府已在昆明買去運輸機C-46五十架，非戰鬥機可隨意購買，戰鬥機之買賣，則必要經過華府方面之核准。（丙）魏氏去渝時與宋院長子文談及剩餘物資之分配與價格，供給中國軍隊之配給，若無其他變動，將在明年三月二日爲止。（丁）魏氏領導下之駐華美軍，只負派員看守倉庫之責，其他租借法案之種種措施，則由將來馬歇爾指示國外淸理委會（哈佛主理）辦理。（戊）在滬之飛機，在可能之情勢下，不再飛用，因戰事已結束，需極力除去飛行失事以避免無謂犧牲。</p>
<p>中蘇自求協議</p>
<p>（二）關於中蘇協商，蘇軍在東北暫緩撤退一事，魏氏未與批評，但稱：中蘇兩國間之事，能自求解決，不需吾人參與，頗堪告慰。美軍現仍堅守不到東北之命令，以避任何不幸之發生。（三）中國戰區美軍之分怖：（甲）在華海陸空軍三萬五千人左右，（乙）分佈在華北地區之海軍陸戰隊五萬二千人共兩師左右。（丙）所謂中國戰區，包括中國越南北緯十六度以南，及台灣，在台灣有美軍二百人，越南有美軍十人，均担任聯絡工作。</p>
<p>二千四千美軍</p>
<p>（四）美軍遣送歸國情形，在明年一月若無大變動，二萬四千名美軍可獲回國，將來運輸船隻較多，最近已有九千美軍被遣送囘國。最後，魏氏請各位記者注意，勿隨意發表肯定之論調，而使魏氏本人未能執行一切類乎諾言之事。舉例言之，魏氏曾允許美軍在囘國前可到各地遊覽，但現在人數過多，已使魏氏不能執行一月前之諾言矣。</p>
<h3>廢止戰區緝私　取銷經濟封鎖</h3>
<p>對外貿易恢復自由〔本報重慶一日電〕據悉，行政當局以戰事業已結束，戰時所訂戰區緝私及經濟封鎖辦法，應予廢止，已通令各徵稅及緝私機關遵照。又貿易委員會上月底已結束，復興公司定本月底結束，統銷統購取銷後，對外貿易完全恢復自由。</p>
<h3>美總統接見　史迪威高思</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕杜魯門總統本日分別接見前任中印緬戰區美軍司令史迪威將軍與前駐華大使高思。總統與前駐華軍事外交代表之談話，已引起此間中國觀察家之注意，因此舉適發生於赫爾利辭職後，衆議紛紛之時。此外，杜魯門總統並接見英駐美大使哈里法克斯與英空軍元帥戴德。</p>
<h3>京都文物（下）</h3>
<p>— 愼之</p>
<p>現在根據日僞方面編造的目錄報告，以及權威人士的意見，略述目前封存文物內容的梗槪如下：</p>
<p>關於圖書部份：南京比較有規模的圖書館，有中央圖書館，國學圖書館，中央大學圖書館，金陵大學圖書館，市立圖書館。此外，國府文官處，主計處，行政院以及所屬各部會，中央然部等的岡書館，無慮二三十個。而私家藏書亦復不少，一時無從調查，如繆鳳林敎授一人，耶有書七千餘冊，據說現在即封存於竹橋地質調查所內。</p>
<p>南京撒退時，中央圖書館僅携走一萬餘册，還有八萬餘册留在南京，其由存故宮庫房的有四萬册，但目前得到消息的只有三萬册。</p>
<p>國學圖書館，爲遜淸道光中兩江總督陶澍的惜陰害舍沿革而來，端方曾改爲江南圖書館，幾經變易，始有今名。藏書以錢唐丁氏之盡爲大宗，宋刋四十餘種，元刋百種，明版無數，其中宋元版書一部份，據說曾携之西行，但尚餘三四十部。館中還有宋敎仁先生的遣書，不知亦無恙否？館長劉詒謀先生已到南京，等待參加淸理。</p>
<p>金陵大學以藏地志書著，中國古代農事及動植物害，獨有珍奇。也有元明刋本，宋代殿本，日本本，高麗本，日本投降後，曾爲日寇盜賣，損失不少，這圖書是在太平洋戰後才落入日偽手中的，故沒有和其他圖書館存書混雜，極易由原主領回。</p>
<p>許多來自各處的圖書，經日僞集中於竹橋地質調查所，曾加整理，出過一小部份的目錄，看樣子是打算經常要做下去的。此外，偽中央岡書館，連「澤人文庫」在內，在南京封存的書籍達二百萬册。</p>
<p>天文氣象儀器方面，中央研究院天文氣象兩研究所西撤時，曾遷走一部份儀器，遺在南京的一部份，或被盜去、或被毀壞，但曾遭八國聯眾之刧的明代渾天儀和日規却還存在。八國聯軍之役，這兩架古天文儀器曾被德國拿去，第一次大戰結束後才運還。北極閣和紫金山兩處的東西雖然不多，但封條照加，並且十分完固，我相信除開學者之外，是什麼人對此却不會發生興趣的。</p>
<p>至於博物部份，範圍之廣，較圖書有過之。主要的是故宮的古物，包括銅器·玉器·書畫等，都封存在中央研究院。據日偽編出的目錄，共計七千餘件。此外爲故宮檔案，有二千多籍，原來埋藏在故宮博物院，後經日僞挖出，現分在北極閣，地質調查所和僞中央圖書館，相信散失不多。在中央研究院封存的，選有中央研究院的動物標本和地質標本，故宮博物院方面已派黃念劬先來京，也在等候參加淸理工作。其體情形，都待淸查後才能知道。（廿三日於南京）</p>
<h3>據美陸軍部官員稱　馬歇爾已離華盛頓　傳將來有出任國務卿之說</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓三十日專電〕馬歇爾元帥於二十八日於白宮與杜魯門及貝爾納斯晤商後，外方對渠於華府之行動，即無所知。馬歇爾元帥猶未獲暇接見記者，亦未對其新任命發表聲明。據陸軍部官員稱：馬歇爾元帥已離華府·渠如不因出席調查珍珠港事件之集會，而延遲行期，則將如杜魯門昨日所稱，可望於今後數日內，首處赴華。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕令日此間一部份外交家觀測，美國臨時駐華大使馬歇爾將軍，於完成其使命後，可能出任國務卿，而現任國務卿貝爾納斯，或將任駐英大使。此項觀測之根據，尚未證實，據稱杜魯門總統對國務院表示不滿，因其提供之報告與意見不佳，巴拉斯丁間題即其一例。總統認爲欲使改組國務院有效，必須起用完全不受政治與黨派壓力之人物，如馬歇爾是。觀察家指出此種觀測在現行情形下，即使準確，亦能爲事實之演變所推翻。</p>
<h3>宋院長　下週來滬</h3>
<p>據本市英文大美晚報獲悉，行政院長宋子文，將於下週再度蒞滬。聞渠對於本市復員建設問題之當前任務，將有所指示，並聞渠蒞滬後，尚擬轉赴南京，積極布置國府復都事宜。按宋院長前月曾滬滬，協助木市各有關當局對煤斤之恐慌，紗廠之復工，內河航渾之恢復，敵僞產業之接收諸問題，多所解決。故對宋氏此行，各方均寄以熟烈之期望。</p>
<h3>雲南省主席　廬漢昨視事　各廳長下午到職</h3>
<p>〔中央社昆明一日電〕滇省主席盧漢，省府委員胡瑛·張邦翰·馬鍈·隴體要·華秀升·王政，秘書長朱景瑄，一日晨九時視事，李代主席宗黃親率省府全體職員歡迎，處主席即席致訓詞，略謂：目前最重要的工作，首在安定社會，使人民安居樂業，並以為政不在多言相策勉。會後舉行茶會，李代主席移交畢，省府職員列隊歡送。又省委兼財廳長華秀升，建廳長隴體要，敎廳長王政，均於下午二時分別到職，由省委胡鍈·張邦翰監督交接手續。</p>
<h3>津浦臨棗綫通車　存煤陸續運京滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社濟南卅日電〕津浦鐵路臨棗支綫，阻斷將達兩月，十一月十九日恢復通軍，在棗莊陶莊兩礦附近之存煤，正陸續運赴徐州，轉運京滬。臨棗支綫原爲運煤而設，日軍投降後，即被共產軍破壞，共軍並岡破壞棗莊陶莊兩煤礦不逞，現臨棗至泰安間尚不能通車，濟南煤荒暫不能解決。</p>
<h3>賀龍率部二次猛攻　包頭外圍在激戰中</h3>
<p>犯歸綏共軍以投降日軍充砲手</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏一日電〕共產軍頭目賀龍，親率其所謂基幹部隊萬人，廿九日晚六時向包頭城垣第二次猛攻，激戰夜，毫無所逞。卅日晨包頭外圍之國軍趕至，已將賀龍部施以反包圍，刻仍在激戰中。又圍攻包頭之共產軍，附有野砲九門，迫擊砲十餘門，砲手均係以已投降之日軍重行武裝充任。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶一日電〕據國軍方面報告，共軍巴開始進攻歸綏，用大砲猛轟，其中有一日本軍官率領日軍砲隊參加。</p>
<p>〔中央社酒泉卅日電〕內蒙額濟納旂商會·敎育會·寺廟及各民衆團體，頃以共黨倡亂，肌碍復員，特電毛澤東，盼懸崖勒馬</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶一日電〕據中央社訊：山東共軍二萬人，擁有機關槍百挺，野槍三十尊，現在濟南以東四十里，準備進攻濟南。共軍二十萬人，自蘇·豫·皖邊境陸續開入魯省。共軍正分兵四路侵人山東，且獲相當進展，西路共軍已越過曹州，中路已抵泰安，東路已過魯省東南膠濟路附近之臨沂，沿海一帶共軍，則已經過膠濟鐵路，取道前往東北。</p>
<h3>武昌衡陽間　開輕型快車</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢口一日電〕粤漢路武昌衡陽段第一班輕型快車，一日晨七時由武昌賓陽門車站開出，當晚可抵寗鄉，二日晚宿長沙，三日即可抵衡陽，票價武長段五五〇〇元，武衡段八二〇〇元。</p>
<h3>青年軍訓練　昨起改施預備軍官敎育　女青年軍決本年底結束</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶一日電〕軍事當局一日實行將靑年軍訓練改施預備軍官敎育，以减少職業軍官，而利國家整廷及鞏固國防。靑年軍士兵經六個月軍官訓練，於明年五月底結業時，再舉行甄審考試，然後退伍，轉學或就業。至於女靑年軍則不必續受軍訓，年底前退伍，發給證件，路費，並通知敎育部按其學歷，程度，准予復學，轉學，或任敎。同時通知有關機關，按其學歷，經歷，優先錄用或回原機關工作。</p>
<h3>星期論壇　一個歷史的敎訓</h3>
<p>— 陳高傭</p>
<p>——中國大一統的局面不容破壞</p>
<p>「分久必合，合久必分」，這種一治一亂的循環現象，雖然是中國歷史上不可否認的陳跡，但自從秦代統一中原以後，大一統的局面已經成爲二千年來中國人民爭求生存的唯一條件了。因爲長久分裂，人民固然無法生存，統治者亦將無能爲力，故由分而合，由割據而統一，乃人民與政府共同蔪求的目的。</p>
<p>無論古今中外，人民生活上的最大要求就是現實生活上的安居樂業。要求安居樂業，就必須環境平安，秩序統一，這是極營通淺近的道理。而在中國秦漢以後，所以能造成一種大一統的局面，而人民亦以實現大一統爲他們理想生活上的最高目的者，猶有特殊原因存在。</p>
<p>首先，從農業與水利上來看。中國自從周代以後，無疑的農業生產已經成爲人民的主要生產事業了。農業生產與水利事業是有密切關係的。中國兩條巨流是黃河與長江，這兩條巨流都是自西至東經過六七省區流入大海的。水利事業包括興利除害兩方面：開溝渠，利灌漑，是興利的事；築塊壩，防淹沒，是除害的事。無論興利除害，都不是分裂割據的局面之下所能辦到的。因爲兩條巨流旣然是東西跨過六七個省區，設此六七省區之中有二個以上的對立政權存在，則上游人民所興之利不能與下游人民取得聯繫，下游人民所欲除去之害，不能得到上游人民的合作，不惟徒勞無功，而且根本無法從事。而且水利的事業，工程浩大，費用繁重，所需時日亦甚長久，若沒有一個强有力的統一機構，很難舉辦的。所以我們從歷史上來看，許多偉大的水利工程都是在全國統一，宇內承平的時候興辦的。而每至四分五裂，割據紛擾的時候，水旱之災就常常連年發生。因水旱之災而人民遭譏饉之荒，因饑饉而生內亂，因內亂引出外患，天災人禍，如影隨形。到了此時，人民救死而恐不贍，更何能談到安居樂業？經過這樣長期的實際經騐，人民對於國家的統一，自然不能不發生極熱烈的要求與愛護了。</p>
<p>其次，從工商業與交通上來看。中國今日以前固然是以農立國，但是春秋戰國以後，工商業漸趨發達實爲不可否認的事實。過去所謂工業當然是指手工業而言，所謂商業亦不過是農產品與手工業出品的交換。但人民旣然有了交換的行爲，就絕不是小國寡民，老死不相往來，可以安其居，樂其俗的。他們需要彼此有聯繫，需要災地有交通，需要懋遷有無通工易事。所以早在左傳上即記載着說：『杞梓皮革，　楚往也，楚雖有材，晋實用之。』投經濟地理學家劃分人類的交通時間；第一期是內河交通，第二期是內海交通，第三期是大洋交通，第四期是大陸交通。這種分期在空中交通實現以來，固不免稍有修正，然前三期的劃分仍是極正確的。中國無內海，所以在大洋交通之前，內河交通盡了極長久極重大的責任。中國內河固有許多支流，然所謂江淮河漢與珠江以及憑人工造成的運河，無論那一條河流至少都要經過今日的二三個省區。假若中國境內，小國林立，問關重重，那能說得上懋遷有無，通工易事？所以從中國的歷史上看來，每到國家統一的時候，就是商業抬頭的機會，而一遇國家紛亂，工商事業便不免一落千丈。漢唐盛世以及宋元明淸的統一時代，不僅國內商業蓬勃發展，就是域外的國際貿易亦大爲興盛。反之如五胡亂華，南北朝對立，以及元末大亂之時，不惟國際貿易完全停頓，即國內所有的商業資本亦完全崩壞，人民經濟又不得不返於自給自足的自然狀態了。過去所謂背本趨末的商人階級，他們當然唯利是圖，但他們在唯利是圖的長期經騐中亦得到一個直覺的認識，就是國家不統一，時局不太平，他們的生意買賣是無法去作的。</p>
<p>人民的現實生活與國家的統一旣有這樣的密切關係，所以二千年來似乎沒有國家民族等抽象觀念的中國老百姓，他們對於國家民族實在是盡過極大的愛護責任了。他們對於國家民族的愛護是直覺的，知其然而不知其所以然，但是他們的情感是很眞實的，而且是很銳敏的。他們有一種極現實與極單純的想法：誰能統一中國，他們就擁戴他；誰要搗亂中國，他們就厭惡他。因爲前者能使他們安居樂業，後者要使他們家破人亡。這種思想當然有時不免發生流弊，所以在過去有時異族入主中國，如果他能使中國長期統一，人民亦就茍安下去了。因此古代聖賢乃嚴夷夏之防，現代革命提倡民族主義，都是用以補偏救弊的。但，無論如何，中國人民對於統一要求的急迫，是可想而知的了。</p>
<p>這種觀念，不僅老百姓如此，就是所謂士大夫階級的知識分子也如此。在每次改朝換代的時候，總有不少忠臣義士犧牲身家性命，以期挽頹勢於萬一。這種思想與行爲的造成，並不是純由學說造成的，亦不是單憑觀念支持的，實在是由大多數人民的現實生活反映而成，由大多數人民的共同支持而行的。因爲大多數人民旣是要求永久統一而惟恐有時分裂，所以不知不覺反映到知識階級的腦筋中，亦發生一種極單純的直覺，以爲改朝換代，不管改的對不對，換的好不好，而於一改一換之間，至少有十數年或幾十年的紛紜擾攘，天下不得太平，人民不得安居樂業。我們要在中國歷史的過程中有所作爲，對於這種由人民現實生活而反映出來的意識，是應當深加體會而不可隨便忽略的。</p>
<p>到了今日，這種情形更加明顯。橫跨東西的兩條巨流仍然存在，從貫南北的兩條幹路—津浦·平漢粵漢又形完成。農業經濟的基礎已是根深蒂固，工商業的發展正在迎頭追趕，全國四萬萬五千萬的人民已經結成一個民族大集團，東西南北的廣大領土，已經形成一個經濟大體系，東西固不容分裂，南北亦無法對時。北伐以前北洋軍閥的武力割據與最近過雲的敵偽任意分裂，在人民的生活上是最難忍受而永遠不能忘記的一段慘痛歷史。人民對於政治現狀縱有不滿，却祇希望改變作風而不希望醞釀內亂。</p>
<p>辛亥革命以後，君主廢棄了，專制政治推翻了，一切制度文物都革故鼎新，截然與前不同了。但是中國二千年來形成的一個大一統局面，則不淮不容有所破壞，而且更需要使它更加密切穩固。所以國父革命對於君主專制的政治不惜用大無畏的精神去推翻它，而對於維持中國大一統的局面隨即創立五族共和一名詞以代之。這種中國歷史的演進方式，我可以斷言，以後政治制度和社會組織，雖隨時代的轉移而可以不斷的在變化之中，但中國大一統的局面絕不容有所破壞。</p>

<h3>德黑蘭蘇軍突撤　美派遣代表團赴伊北調查</h3>
<p>〔聯合社德黑蘭一日電〕此間今日消息：蘇聯軍隊已於星期四起突自德黑蘭撤退。火車站交通中心點及私家宿舍中，包括司令部在內，均已撤退一空。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓一日電〕國務院宣稱：德黑蘭美大使館已派三人代表團前往伊朋動亂之中心大不里士，大約事先曾與蘇方在德黑蘭議妥。美國於上星期建議於明年一月一日前撤退伊朗外國駐軍，英蘇至今猶未答覆。</p>
<p>蘇聯牒覆伊朗否認干涉內政</p>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭一日電〕蘇大使館覆伊朗外部之照會，內容已於今日　　：　方除不許伊重通過外，復否認伊政府指責蘇方之各點。據稱，如再有伊軍向北移動，則伊朗北部之戰事及流血將不能免，　是之故，蘇聯政府不得不增調軍隊來伊，以保護該地蘇聯之駐軍。但蘇政府旣不願增兵伊朗，故　伊朗政府尙以勿派兵至伊朗北部諸省爲是。蘇覆牒復否認蘇聯曾干涉伊朗之政治及經濟，更否認曾援助寇治部落人，而巴薩爾之自伊拉克潛入伊朗，亦與蘇聯　　。再伊朗擬於伊土邊界，設立邊疆駐防所之阻碍與困難，亦與蘇聯奮鬥。蘇　牒　　，伊北事件實係山伊憲兵及官史所造成云。</p>
<p>和平抑為備戰人心皇皇不安</p>
<p>蘇覆牒遞到後，使伊朗政界大感驚異，與英美及伊朗最近所表示之志願，莫完全相反。惟當覆牒發表後，不久官方即宣布德黑蘭之蘇軍已自火車站，交通中心及軍營等處撤退，民衆對此舉用意何在，爲和平抑爲備戰，猶不明瞭。又傳英美軍隊已在巴格達及伊朗南部集中，確否猶待證實。伊北來訊謂蘇軍已挖掘戰隊，以防伊軍，萬一不願蘇方之拒絕而北開，政府雖力圖安定民心，然亦不能掩飾事實之嚴重。德黑蘭之商人，紛紛將家屬及文件，遷往伊朗南部之安全地帶，　軍不斷開至京城佈防，在郊外佈置陣地。</p>
<h3>聯合國大會決設　社會經濟兩委會　推選法官不容延緩　梁鋆立主張獲代表贊助</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕聯合國機構全體大會之技術委員會今日集會時，烏克蘭代表致詞，力主關於經濟與社會問題，大會應僅設一個主要委員會，此兩項工作如果劃分或將促使重要之社會建議誤入歧途。今日集會時辯論，始終根據實際便利一點，爭論是吾應設一個抑二個經濟與社會委員會之問題，經最後票決，聯合五國鍳於工作範圍廣大而提設立兩個委員會之建議獲得勝利。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿九日電〕本晚籌委會檢討聯合國法律問題時，我代表梁鋆立對澳代表提暫緩推選國際法庭法官之建議，表示反對。梁氏所持理由爲中國鍳於此項法官之推選，固有澈底準備之必要，然允諷聯合國組織各主要機構，有同時成立之必需性。設或象徵世界正義之國際法庭，其他各主要機構成立時猶未組織，實有損聯合國組織之聲譽。且國際法庭籌組延期，可能以此爲藉口，而成爲共他機構延期之先例。我代表之意見，獲得美代表史蒂芬之生贊助。</p>
<h3>臨時托管委會　設置問題未決</h3>

<p>〔路透社紐倫堡一日電〕此間軍事法庭今日決定，一九四一年負神秘使命自德飛英之德副元首赫斯，必須與其他主要納粹戰犯十九人同受審問。法庭於今晨九時（上海時間午後五時）甫過，繼續開審，庭長洛侖斯法官宣佈「法庭根據種種證據，認為被告赫斯現能受審，故被告律師之動議，應加駁覆。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐倫堡三十日電〕赫斯容貌可畏，天性機詐，在英國被俘後，似患健忘症，今日開庭特別訊問赫斯是否應繼續受審，詎知赫斯乃宣讀驚人供辭，自稱係假裝健忘，聯合國醫師及其辯護律師竟咸受其愚。在今日開庭前，赫斯僅謂擬在庭上發言，但未說明將言何事。</p>

<h3>本報特訪　華僑最高學府　暨南大學動態　校長何炳松氏告本報記者</h3>
<p>曁南大學，爲華僑創辦之最高學府，校址在上海眞茹，設備完善，規模宏大，八一三之役，燬於暴敵砲火，後轉輾遷移而至大後方之福建建陽，慘澹經營，卓著成績。一昨清晨，本報記者往訪該校校長何炳松氏於其滬寓，承何氏詳告該校動態如下：曁南大學，原址眞茹，予（何氏自稱）於民國廿四年間，始任該校校長。</p>
<p>眞茹校舍被燬</p>
<p>八一三之役，抗戰軍興，眞茹校舍悉被敵人砲火轟炸燬滅。當時因學生學業未便中斷，在匆迫中，遷至本市租界開學。嗣國軍西撤，仍留孤島，繼續上課。迨太平洋戰爭發生，迫於惡劣環境，不能再作安土重遷之想，乃親率全體師生，轉赴後方。</p>
<p>遷至建陽上課</p>
<p>迢迢千里，跋涉長途，風餐露宿，備嘗艱苦，轉輾而至福建建甌縣西北之建陽，即以其地孔廟爲曁大辦事處，幷借祠堂廟宇爲校舍，另再搭蓋茅屋，設置課室，照常上課。惟建陽地處偏僻，當時發生兩大困難，一爲敎科用書不易購置，一爲理化方面應用儀器無從購置。</p>
<p>解決兩大困難</p>
<p>嗣經多方設法，敎科用書，向遼遠之福州前去採辦。所有理化儀器，商請閩浙兩省公立理化研究所臨時借用。此兩大難題，始告解決。但是臨時應用理化儀器時，又感覺到不方便，不經濟：學生需要化騐時，必須跑到距校尚遠之閩浙理化研究所去實習。每次一來一往，開支非常浩大，統由學校方面負擔。現在已設立者，祇有文，理，商三院。</p>
<p>建議添設學院</p>
<p>值此抗戰結束建國開始之際，亟應擴大組織，予已具呈敎部建議，擬於曁大回滬復校時，增設華僑師範學院，法學院，與華僑先修班。目下予在上海，正在尋覓臨時校舍，預料奔走結果，恐至早亦須春假以後，或可達到目的。建陽方面現有學生一千一百五十餘人，將來全體束裝回滬，亦必須煞費苦心，預爲部署云。</p>

<p>回力球塲人山人海</p>
<p>昨天下午一點鐘還差一刻，亞爾培路回力球塲一帶巳人山人海，美軍大大小小的車子，　一連二的向回力球塲直駛。忽怱趕到塲中，數千個美海陸空軍都已整整齊齊，圍坐在四週。剛坐下來，就聽到廣播機中報告，黃包車比賽正在路中。不幾分鐘，就要到此。果然，不到十分鐘—那時是一點三十五分，祗聽得　中在呌大喊，原來第一名十七號車子已到達終點。接着第二名十六號，美第十航空隊蓓蒂絲小姐及第三名十五號龔小姐所坐車，也跟着到來。盟軍們一會坐下，一會又起來大呌。原來，一輛輛車都陸續來了。最後三名是十一號，十九號，七號，有幾位小姐，雖然落後，到了塲中，仍舊還握着雙拳，呌車夫向前拉。可憐的黃包車火，已累得頭也抬不起來了。</p>
<p>黃包車皇后的產生</p>
<p>第一名「黃包車小姐一瓊南茄，體重一一五磅，乃代表美港口司令室的。穿了件灰色長大衣，戴白色耳環，有着黑黑的頭髮，後面梳了一個髮髻，捧了鮮花坐在車上，被攝影記者們包圍起來。其他的小姐們也同樣的讓開末拉照着各式各樣的鏡頭。</p>

<p>報告員報告足球比賽隨即開始，陸軍方面牽了只小馬出來，海軍一面牽了只羊出來，於是美軍們都提足了精神，高興得什麽似的。記者們的開末拉也就轉變方向，球賽即在中國國歌，及美國國旗歌聲中（由一位犬斯迪斯小姐伴唱）開始。</p>
<p>球塲上一角停着一輛救護車，對角是紅十字會的服務隊，一面比球，一面報告員告訴大家一個好消息，紅十字會帶了二萬只「熱狗」，還有咖啡招待，立刻紅十字會告事旁，即吸引了一大羣的海軍及陸電去了。</p>

<h3>社會服務　展開救濟事業　籲請各方捐輸</h3>
<p>四項救濟·至少二百萬元　貧民請願·情緒非常悲哀</p>
<p>本處貴近接到失業羣的來信，日必數十件，而到館面陳苦衷的，爲數也不少，信裏訴苦的話，眞是一字一淚，非常悲哀！失業誠然是最苦的遭遇，經濟困窘尤爲慘痛的壓力；在目前的海上生活，有職業的人尙感左支右絀，何况游手好閒，一無進益的呢？他們的要求：第一是希望就職業，第二是希望借「小本貸金」，做些小買賣，以維持其生計，理由極其正當，情節也充分懇摯，我們表示十二分的同情。可惜本處結存的捐款，爲數極微，除助學金外，合苦兒敎義助金，醫藥助金，助產金及小本貸金，總數只剩六萬餘元要是分配四項救濟，實在感覺困難，無米爲炊，其將奈何！</p>
<p>今，百物昂貴，以言「小本貸金」，每人至少貸款五千元，假如核准貸放一百人，就得湊集五十萬元，纔可以應付，他如拯救無父無母的孤兒，保送至各敎養機關；救濟一般貧病交迫的苦人，保送各院施醫給藥；救助貧苦產婦，送特約醫院接生，這四項救濟事業，每項至少需要基金五千萬元，共需二百萬元，纔能逐項推動，展開我們的實際工作。我今天以十二萬分的誠意，向任界熱心有力人士，作將伯之呼，務請慨解仁囊，多多捐輸，敬代難胞九頓首以謝！</p>

<p>（三）凡本市各學校學生敎師曁其直系親屬，又本市　水階級者，祇須備有公函或證明文件，一律半費檢查。</p>
<p>（四）凡檢出有肺病，須施行壓縮手術（人工氣胸）者，如不能担負，均由本欄付給各醫院津貼費，每人一萬元，期限一年，（按現時情形，每萬元僅合白米一石，即可及早搶救一肺癆患者，費至低之經濟力，發揮莫大之效果，此之謂歟！）此項「擔米救護肺癆運動」，實爲積極救濟當務之急，蓋救一人，等於救一全家，甚望熱心人士，慷慨捐助，惠予提倡，幸甚！</p>
<p>地點—醫院名凡以上各大醫院，在門診時間，均可前往檢查。</p>
<p>期限—自即日起，至本年十二月底爲止，不再展期。</p>

<p>申報社會服務處台鍳：家父松年，兄從良，原籍瀏河，居滬多年，以經營米業爲生。（家原住靜安寺路廟弄里十號，現已不識遷往何處？及家人是否存在？因去函已遭退回，致原於滬何處經營，因余逃出時幼小，現已記不淸楚矣），不幸「八一三」滬戰發生，余由姑母領養，倉皇逃出，又不幸姑母於嘉興死於敵人轟炸之下，八年來受盡千辛萬苦，輾轉來渝，雖曾多次奉函回家，均如石沉大海。孤苦零仃，漂落異鄉，思親想家，無時或已，慘痛極矣！望貴報賜予登載，代查「陸松年」現居何處？如有仁人君子及家父親友知其下落者，祈代轉告，或由貴欄轉寄，不勝　禱。不幸孤仃女陸曼英敬懇十一月二十四日（圖示請交重慶三聖宮政治部警務所周建國先生轉）</p>

<h3>最短的劇評</h3>
<p>— 胡悲</p>
<p>劇評家天天看戲，戲看膩了，有時候看到壞戲，所寫的劇評頗堪發噱。美國名劇評家愛金生寫過一篇最短的劇評：『某一　戲昨晚演出了。為甚麽呢？』</p>
<p>另外一位劇評家批評一齣歌劇說，某歌劇班『於不足數的延期以後，來到城裏演出了。』</p>
<p>影評家拉特納批評電影『巴拿瑪海蒂』說，『這齣電影好像缺了一些東西，大概就是埋葬。』</p>
<p>劇評家拉斯科說某女演員的表情使他『心惡』。第二天，那位女演員買了一瓶萆蔴油去送給他。</p>
<p>在看完一齣很壞的戲以後，有一位陌生的觀眾問劇評家科夫曼說：『你看着齣戲怎麽樣？』科夫曼回答說，『要我來批評未免太不公平了。我是在極不幸的情景下看這齣戲的。　向上拉的時候。』</p>

<p>美國電影明星保蘭·牟尼特別善於表演有特殊性格的角色。有一次他在一家劇院裏表演礦工的代表，向鐵石心腸的礦主要求增加工資。在第二幕的末了，他在要求增加工資以後，礦主不答應，把他一脚踢出去。有一天晚上，保蘭·牟尼的全家都來看戲，保蘭·牟尼的演出更加賣力。他用那超特的口才去叙述礦工妻兒挨餓的情形。在表演得最動人的時候，不料那個表演礦主的賞竟情不自禁，大受感動，涕泗交流，喊道：『好了！好了！你使我心碎了。自然，你們的工資可以增加！』劇團的負責人見勢不妙，趕快呌下幕。在第三幕開始以前，劇院的經理祇好跑到幕前來說明，說那礦主後來又改變了主意，不允增加礦工的工資。</p>
<h3>却爾斯勞頓新作</h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>「却爾斯勞頓從來沒有拍過一部壞片子」，這恐怕是影迷們公認的事實。</p>
<p>一九四五年却爾斯勞頓拍了一十八世紀海盜為題材的鉅片「吉特船長」Captiain　Kidd這是羅勃脫N李的一篇小說改篇的，由羅倫V李導演聯美發行。</p>
<p>「吉特船長」不說是「叛艦喋血記」的姊妹作，場面十分偉大，明星除却爾斯勞頓外，尚有侖道夫史谷德，約翰卡立亭，吉爾勃羅倫等；白蓓蘭勃立登是片中唯一的女性，却爾斯勞頓飾吉特船長演技洗鍊，他自己也認為這部片子是他近年來最得意的一部作品。</p>
<p>「吉特船長」中有一艘歷史性的西班牙式大船高二百呎，闊七十五呎，甲板寬廣。製造之精良，耗資之鉅大，就是二百五十年前航行於大海中的大船恐怕也難與比擬。然而它祇偶而被應用在攝影場的假的海洋上行駛。這一艘歷史性的西班牙式大船，最早是在勞倫斯奧里佛費文　主演的「忠魂鵑血」中漏臉，以後又在泰羅鮑華，拉爾達克雷格，瑪琳奧哈蘭合演的「黑大鵝」（此片係當年范倫鐵諾傑作）和鮑伯霍浦，維多麥克勞倫的「公主與海盜」中演出。這艘船的歷史，倒也是一個有趣的電影小　故呢！</p>

<h3>敵人　The　Enemt　（十一）</h3>
<p>— 賽珍珠著　朱綺譯</p>
<p>廚子驕傲地說：『小主人因為他有能救人出死入生的技術，因此他就救起任何人來。』她熟練地割開了一隻鷄的頭頸，抓着這飛撲着的鷄，將牠的血洒在一棵紫籐花的根上。血是最好的肥料，老園丁是不許她浪費一滴的。</p>
<p>弓子憂愁地說：『我們一定要想到孩子們。如果他們的父親給判處了賣國的罪，他們的命運又將如何呢？』</p>
<p>他們說話時並不怕花子聽見，花子是站在很靠近他們的洋合上，整理着花的，她也知道他們是故意講給她聽的。她也很知道他們的話是對的。可是還有另一部分的她，連她自己都不了解，這並不是對那俘虜的軟心腸的喜愛。她現在想到他是一個俘虜了。昨天他激動地說：『無論如何，讓我告訴你，我的名字叫湯姆』就是在那個時候，她都沒有歡喜他。她祗遠遠地輕輕鞠躬。她看見他眼睛中表現出來的感情受了傷害，可是她不想去安慰他。他的確是這屋子裏的一個大問題。</p>
<p>至於貞雄呢，他每天小心地檢騐那個傷口。今天早上，那傷口的最後的一針也拆了綫，再過兩個星期，這人就可以算完全治愈了。貞雄回到他的辦公室裏，小心地用打字機打了一封報告這事首尾的信給警察局。他打完了『二月二十一日，有一個逃犯破水冲到我屋前的岸上來。』就拉開了他書桌的一隻秘密抽斗，將那未完成的報告放在裏面。</p>
<p>這事發生後的第七天，發生了兩件事。早晨，所有的傭人都將行李包在大包袱裏，一起走了。早上花子起身時，看見屋子裏一切工作都沒有做，房間既未打掃，早餐也未預備，她曉得這是什麽意思。她慌子，甚至感到恐怖，可是做主婦的驕傲使她一點不表現出來。當他們在廚房裏見她時，她還莊重地向他們微微鞠躬　結清他們的工錢，感謝他們以前替她所做的一切工作。他們都哭了，但是她不哭。</p>

        <h1>1945.12.02</h1>
<h3>The Chinese and Soviet Sides Agree to Negotiate An Extension of the Soviet Troop Withdrawal Deadline</h3>
<p>Nationalist Troops Only Ninety Li from Shenyang</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast, according to official sources, the Chinese and Soviet governments have agreed after consultation to revise the completion date of the withdrawal to January 1st of next year (originally set for December 3rd of this year). It is also reported that this revision is to enable Chinese personnel going to the Northeast for takeover, and Chinese government troops, to arrive in the Northeast before the deadline, in accordance with the newly established methods, to carry out their takeover tasks.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] Today, the Chinese side here firmly stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to Chinese airlift troops landing in Changchun and Shenyang, and has permitted Chinese air force ground personnel to immediately proceed to the aforementioned two locations to arrange for the landing of airlift troops. They further stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to Chinese ground troops advancing towards Shenyang. According to an unconfirmed report, the vanguard of the Nationalist troops has advanced to a location only ninety li from Shenyang. It is rumored that the Soviet authorities have cleared the communist troops and other miscellaneous forces from Changchun airfield, and that communication has been restored at the airfield's radio station and other important locations. While observers here are more optimistic about the prospects of recovering the Nine Eastern Provinces soon due to the developments of the past few days, the internal strife between communist troops and Nationalist troops in broad areas of North China remains serious.</p>
<p>[China News Agency, Tianjin, 1st] The Nationalist troops in Jinzhou are continuing to advance. The airfield in that county is now usable. The section of the Beining Railway from Tianjin to Qinhuangdao is frequently patrolled by road protection troops with armored vehicles, and is now unobstructed. The section from Qinhuangdao to Yu Guan is impassable due to the destruction of a railway bridge, but traffic has resumed between Yu Guan and Jinzhou.</p>
<p>All Countries Hope the Letter and Spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty Will Not Be Overstepped</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] The ancillary conditions of the Sino-Soviet agreement are unknown, but this move has great significance domestically and internationally, namely that the Soviet Union is handing over the Nine Eastern Provinces to the Central Government, not to the Chinese Communist Party. After this issue is favorably resolved, the work of the new American ambassador, Marshall, in China will be easier to undertake. Officials here remain silent regarding rumors of Soviet demands. Indeed, such concessions would effectively make the Northeast a jointly administered area, which cannot but cause serious concern to other countries, as all countries clearly hope that the letter and spirit of the Sino-Soviet treaty will not be overstepped. At the same time, the high-ranking officials in charge of the Northeast takeover are expected to quickly return to Changchun. The Chinese Communist Party once regarded the Northeast as being in their pocket, and now they will be greatly disappointed by this agreement. However, the CCP must have gotten wind of something, as all communist troops in Changchun have already withdrawn. Whether this move was at the request of the Soviet Union is unknown.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Nationalist Troops Transported by Air Depart from Beiping, Now Arrived in Changchun</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] Regarding the takeover and management of railways in the Northeast, both parties are in smooth negotiation, and discussions are still ongoing. The work of transporting Nationalist troops by air to Changchun is being actively arranged by General Xiao Yanping, deputy director of the Northeast Headquarters. It is reported that the authorities currently feel that there is an insufficient number of technical personnel for employment, causing great inconvenience in the takeover and management. Therefore, they temporarily intend to rely on American and Soviet technical personnel to assist with everything, and the same goes for the original Japanese technicians in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] The chairmen of three provinces of the Nine Eastern Provinces have already arrived in Jinzhou, preparing to take over the administrative organs of these three provinces.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] General Zhang Lehua, deputy commander of the Northeast Security Command, will fly to Hankou and then to Xunyang in the next few days, because the Southwest Cadre Training Corps has been ordered to move to the old site of the Lushan Training Corps in Xingzi County and will be renamed the Central Reintegration Training Corps. The commanding officer is specifically making arrangements for everything, and will then fly to the Northeast to direct the reintegration work. Furthermore, according to a broadcast from San Francisco, the first batch of Nationalist troops transported by air has departed from Beiping and arrived in Changchun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] Xu Cheng, chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government, is leading personnel from the provincial government to Jinzhou in the next few days to proceed to Shenyang with the army to handle the takeover work.</p>
<h3>Marshall Will Surely Have New Instructions Regarding All Unresolved Work in China, Said Wedemeyer at a Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] General Wedemeyer hosted the press corps of this city at the Construction Building yesterday morning, with Mr. Deng Shuxun of the US Information Service acting as translator. The meeting lasted about an hour. Wedemeyer first stated: General Marshall's arrival in China for work is a fortunate choice, and we are extremely pleased with this. This is because Marshall is a man who dares to act, has experience in both military and political affairs, acts impartially, and has judgment, and is highly trusted by the US Congress. Marshall will arrive in China to take office within ten days to two weeks.</p>
<p>Regarding Hurley's Statement</p>
<p>Regarding Ambassador Hurley's statement, Wedemeyer did not make any criticisms, but said: Ambassador Hurley cooperated extremely well with him, faithfully implemented American policy, and was extremely friendly with Wedemeyer. It is believed that Marshall's arrival in China will surely bring new instructions regarding all unresolved work. Details regarding the organization of the military delegation, the handling of officers and soldiers of the US military who are short of service points and cannot return to their country, and the withdrawal date of the US Marine Corps in North China are all based on American policy and can be decided after Marshall arrives in China.</p>
<p>Lend-Lease Act Issues</p>
<p>Afterward, Wedemeyer discussed the following issues with the reporters: (1) Lend-Lease Act issues. (A) The distribution method of American aircraft in Shanghai is not an example of the Lend-Lease Act. The remaining American military materials in Shanghai will be handled by the Remaining Materials Clearing Committee, and the China Theater Command is not responsible for anything. There are about seven hundred American aircraft stored, distributed in Shanghai, Kunming, Zhijiang, and other places. However, most are concentrated in Shanghai. (B) All remaining materials will be sold. The French government has already bought fifty C-46 transport aircraft in Kunming. Non-combat aircraft can be purchased at will, but the sale of combat aircraft must be approved by Washington. (C) When Wedemeyer went to Chongqing, he discussed the distribution and prices of remaining materials with President Song Ziwen, and the supply of rations to the Chinese army will continue until March 2nd of next year if there are no other changes. (D) The US military stationed in China under Wedemeyer's leadership is only responsible for assigning personnel to guard warehouses. Other measures under the Lend-Lease Act will be handled by the Overseas Clearing Committee (headed by Harvard) as instructed by Marshall in the future. (E) The aircraft in Shanghai will no longer be flown if possible, because the war has ended and efforts must be made to eliminate flight accidents to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>China and the Soviet Union Seek Agreements on Their Own</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the temporary postponement of the Soviet troop withdrawal from the Northeast, Wedemeyer did not make any criticisms, but said: It is quite comforting that matters between China and the Soviet Union can be resolved on their own without our participation. The US military is still adhering to the order not to go to the Northeast to avoid any unfortunate events. (3) Distribution of the US military in the China Theater: (A) There are about 35,000 naval, ground, and air forces in China. (B) There are about 52,000 marines, totaling two divisions, distributed in the North China region. (C) The so-called China Theater includes China, Vietnam south of 16 degrees north latitude, and Taiwan. There are 200 American troops in Taiwan and 10 American troops in Vietnam, all performing liaison work.</p>
<p>Two Thousand Four Thousand American Troops</p>
<p>(4) The situation of the US military being sent back to their country. If there are no major changes in January of next year, 24,000 American troops can return home. There will be more transport ships in the future. Recently, 9,000 American troops have been sent back to their country. Finally, Wedemeyer asked all reporters to pay attention and not to casually publish affirmative statements, which would make it impossible for Wedemeyer himself to fulfill all similar promises. For example, Wedemeyer had allowed American troops to visit various places before returning home, but now the number of people is too large, making it impossible for Wedemeyer to fulfill the promise he made a month ago.</p>
<h3>Abolish Wartime Anti-Smuggling, Cancel Economic Blockade</h3>
<p>Foreign Trade Restored to Freedom</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] It is reported that the administrative authorities, in view of the fact that the war has ended, have ordered all tax collection and anti-smuggling agencies to abolish the wartime anti-smuggling and economic blockade measures previously established during the war. Furthermore, the Trade Commission ended at the end of last month, and the Reconstruction Corporation is scheduled to end at the end of this month. After the cancellation of unified sales and unified purchases, foreign trade has been completely restored to freedom.</p>
<h3>US President Receives Stilwell and Gauss</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] President Truman separately received General Stilwell, the former commander of the US military in the China-India-Burma Theater, and Gauss, the former ambassador to China, today. The conversations between the President and the former military and diplomatic representatives to China have attracted the attention of China observers here, as this move occurred after Hurley's resignation, amidst much discussion. In addition, President Truman also received the British Ambassador to the US, Halifax, and the British Air Chief Marshal Tedder.</p>
<h3>Kyoto Cultural Relics (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhi</p>
<p>Based on the catalogs compiled by the Japanese puppet regime and the opinions of authoritative individuals, a brief description of the contents of the currently sealed cultural relics is provided below:</p>
<p>Regarding the book section: The more substantial libraries in Nanjing include the Central Library, the Guoxue Library, the Central University Library, the Jinling University Library, and the Municipal Library. In addition, there are no fewer than twenty or thirty libraries belonging to the government's civil service office, the accounting office, the Executive Yuan, and its affiliated ministries and commissions, and the central department. There are also many private collections, making it impossible to investigate them all at once. For example, Professor Miao Fenglin alone has more than 7,000 books, which are said to be currently sealed in the Zhugiao Geological Survey Institute.</p>
<p>When Nanjing retreated, the Central Library only took more than 10,000 volumes with them, leaving more than 80,000 volumes in Nanjing, including 40,000 volumes stored in the Forbidden City warehouse, but only 30,000 volumes have been reported so far.</p>
<p>The Guoxue Library evolved from Tao Shu's Xiyin Caisher, which was built during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. Duanfang later renamed it the Jiangnan Library. After several changes, it acquired its current name. The collection mainly consists of the Ding family's collection from Qiantang, with more than forty Song editions, one hundred Yuan editions, and countless Ming editions, some of which are said to have been taken westward, but thirty or forty copies still remain. The library also contains Mr. Song Jiaoren's posthumous works, and it is unknown if they are also safe. Director Liu Yimou has arrived in Nanjing, waiting to participate in the cleanup.</p>
<p>Jinling University is known for its collection of gazetteers, ancient Chinese agricultural affairs, and unique animal and plant pests. It also has Yuan and Ming editions, Song Dynasty palace editions, Japanese editions, and Goryeo editions. After Japan's surrender, it was stolen and sold by Japanese invaders, resulting in significant losses. These books fell into the hands of the Japanese puppet regime after the Pacific War, so they were not mixed with the books stored in other libraries, making it easy for the original owners to reclaim them.</p>
<p>Many books from various places were concentrated in the Zhugiao Geological Survey Institute by the Japanese puppet regime and were partially sorted. A small catalog was published, indicating that they planned to continue doing so regularly. In addition, the pseudo-Central Library, including the "Ze Ren Wen Ku," has two million books sealed in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Regarding astronomical and meteorological instruments, when the Central Research Institute's Astronomical and Meteorological Research Institutes retreated westward, a portion of the instruments was moved away. A portion left in Nanjing was either stolen or damaged, but the Ming Dynasty armillary sphere and sundial, which had been looted during the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion, still exist. During the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion, these two ancient astronomical instruments were taken to Germany, and only returned after the end of World War I. Although there are not many items at both Beijige and Zijin Mountain, seals were added, and they are very intact. I believe that no one but scholars would be interested in them.</p>
<p>As for the museum section, the scope is wider than that of the book section. The main items are the Forbidden City's antiquities, including bronzes, jade objects, and paintings, which are all sealed in the Central Research Institute. According to the catalog compiled by the Japanese puppet regime, there are more than 7,000 items in total. In addition, there are more than 2,000 volumes of Forbidden City archives, which were originally buried in the Forbidden City Museum, and were later excavated by the Japanese puppet regime. They are now divided between Beijige, the Geological Survey Institute, and the pseudo-Central Library. It is believed that not many have been lost. The Central Research Institute's animal specimens and geological specimens are sealed in the Central Research Institute. Huang Nianqu has been sent to Beijing by the Forbidden City Museum and is also waiting to participate in the cleanup work. The specific situation can only be known after investigation. (Nanjing, 23rd)</p>
<h3>According to US Army Department Officials, Marshall Has Left Washington, It Is Rumored That He Will Take Over as Secretary of State in the Future</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th Dispatch] After Marshal Marshall met with Truman and Byrnes at the White House on the 28th, the outside world knew nothing about his activities in Washington. Marshal Marshall has not yet had time to meet with reporters, nor has he issued a statement on his new appointment. According to Army Department officials, Marshal Marshall has left Washington. If he is not delayed by attending the meeting to investigate the Pearl Harbor incident, he will, as Truman said yesterday, be expected to leave for China in the next few days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] Today, some diplomats here speculate that General Marshall, the temporary US ambassador to China, may become Secretary of State after completing his mission, while the current Secretary of State, Byrnes, may become ambassador to the UK. The basis for this speculation has not been confirmed. It is said that President Truman is dissatisfied with the State Department because the reports and opinions it provides are not good, the Palestine issue being one example. The President believes that to make the reorganization of the State Department effective, it is necessary to use someone who is completely free from political and partisan pressure, such as Marshall. Observers point out that even if this speculation is accurate under the current circumstances, it can be overturned by the evolution of events.</p>
<h3>President Song Will Come to Shanghai Next Week</h3>
<p>According to the English-language newspaper "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" in this city, President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen will visit Shanghai again next week. It is heard that he will give instructions on the current tasks of the city's reconstruction, and that after arriving in Shanghai, he also intends to go to Nanjing to actively arrange for the return of the national government to the capital. President Song visited Shanghai last month to assist the relevant authorities in resolving issues such as the coal shortage, the resumption of work in yarn factories, the restoration of inland river navigation, and the takeover of enemy and puppet industries. Therefore, all parties have high hopes for Song's trip.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Provincial Chairman Lu Han Took Office Yesterday, All Department Heads Arrived in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 1st] Yunnan Provincial Chairman Lu Han, provincial government members Hu Ying, Zhang Banghan, Ma Ying, Long Tiyao, Hua Xiusheng, Wang Zheng, and Secretary-General Zhu Jingxuan took office at 9:00 a.m. on the 1st. Acting Chairman Li Zonghuang personally led all the staff of the provincial government to welcome them. Acting Chairman Li gave a speech on the spot, stating that the most important work at present is to stabilize society and enable people to live and work in peace. He also encouraged them to govern with few words and careful planning. A tea party was held after the meeting. After Acting Chairman Li completed the handover, the provincial government staff lined up to see him off. In addition, Hua Xiusheng, head of the provincial committee and director of the finance department, Long Tiyao, director of the construction department, and Wang Zheng, director of the education department, all took office at 2:00 p.m. respectively, and the handover procedures were supervised by provincial committee members Hu Ying and Zhang Banghan.</p>
<h3>The Jinpu Railway Linzao Line is Open to Traffic, Coal is Continuously Transported to Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 30th] The Linzao branch line of the Jinpu Railway, which had been blocked for nearly two months, was reopened to military traffic on November 19th. The coal stored near the Zaozhuang and Taozhuang mines is being continuously transported to Xuzhou, and then transferred to Nanjing and Shanghai. The Linzao branch line was originally built for coal transportation. After the Japanese army surrendered, it was destroyed by the communist army. The communist army also recklessly destroyed the Zaozhuang and Taozhuang coal mines. Currently, the section between Linzao and Tai'an cannot be opened to traffic, and the coal shortage in Jinan cannot be resolved for the time being.</p>
<h3>He Long Leads His Troops in a Second Fierce Attack, Fierce Fighting on the Periphery of Baotou</h3>
<p>Communist Troops Attacking Gui Sui Use Surrendered Japanese Soldiers as Gunners</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 1st] Communist military leader He Long personally led 10,000 of his so-called core troops to launch a second fierce attack on the city walls of Baotou at 6:00 p.m. on the 29th. After a night of fierce fighting, they achieved nothing. On the morning of the 30th, the Nationalist troops on the periphery of Baotou rushed to the scene and have counter-encircled He Long's troops. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. Furthermore, the communist troops besieging Baotou are accompanied by nine field guns and more than ten mortars. The gunners are all re-armed surrendered Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] According to reports from the Nationalist army, the communist army has begun to attack Gui Sui, using artillery fire. Among them, a Japanese officer is leading a Japanese artillery unit to participate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jiuquan, 30th] The Inner Mongolia Ejina Banner Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Temples and various mass organizations have recently sent a telegram to Mao Zedong, hoping that he will "rein in at the edge of the precipice" because the communist party is causing chaos and hindering reintegration.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] According to the Central News Agency, 20,000 communist troops in Shandong, possessing 100 machine guns and 30 field guns, are now 40 li east of Jinan, preparing to attack Jinan. 200,000 communist troops are successively entering Shandong Province from the borders of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui. The communist army is dividing its forces into four routes to invade Shandong and has made considerable progress. The communist army on the west route has crossed Caozhou, the central route has reached Tai'an, the east route has crossed Linyi near the Jiaoji Railway in southeastern Shandong, and the communist army along the coast has passed the Jiaoji Railway and is heading to the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Light Express Train Opens Between Wuchang and Hengyang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 1st] The first light express train on the Wuchang-Hengyang section of the Yuehan Railway departed from the Bin Yang Gate Station in Wuchang at 7:00 a.m. on the 1st.

The fare is 5,500 yuan for the Wuchang-Changsha section and 8,200 yuan for the Wuchang-Hengyang section.</p>
<h3>Youth Army Training Changed to Reserve Officer Education Yesterday, Female Youth Army Decided to End This Year</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] Military authorities implemented the change of Youth Army training to reserve officer education on the 1st in order to reduce professional officers and benefit national streamlining and consolidate national defense. Youth Army soldiers will undergo six months of officer training and will graduate at the end of May next year. They will then undergo a qualification examination before being discharged and transferring to school or employment. As for female Youth Army members, they do not need to continue military training and will be discharged before the end of the year. They will be issued certificates, travel expenses, and the Ministry of Education will be notified to allow them to resume schooling, transfer to other schools, or teach based on their academic qualifications and levels. At the same time, relevant agencies will be notified to prioritize their employment or return to their original agencies based on their academic qualifications and experience.</p>
<h3>Weekly Forum: A Lesson of History</h3>
<p>— Chen Gaoyong</p>
<p>——The situation of China's great unification must not be destroyed</p>
<p>"Unity follows division, and division follows unity." Although this cyclical phenomenon of order and chaos is an undeniable vestige of Chinese history, ever since the Qin Dynasty unified the Central Plains, the situation of great unification has become the sole condition for the Chinese people to strive for survival for two thousand years. Because prolonged division makes it impossible for the people to survive and leaves the rulers powerless, the goal jointly sought by the people and the government is to move from division to unity, from separation to unification.</p>
<p>Whether in ancient or modern times, in China or abroad, the greatest demand of people's lives is to live and work in peace and contentment in reality. To demand to live and work in peace and contentment, the environment must be peaceful and the order unified. This is an extremely common and simple truth. Moreover, after the Qin and Han Dynasties in China, the ability to create a situation of great unification, and for the people to regard realizing great unification as the highest goal in their ideal life, was due to the existence of special reasons.</p>
<p>First, from the perspective of agriculture and water conservancy. Since the Zhou Dynasty, there is no doubt that agricultural production has become the main production undertaking of the people. Agricultural production is closely related to water conservancy. China's two major rivers are the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, both of which flow from west to east through six or seven provinces into the sea. Water conservancy includes both promoting benefits and eliminating harms: opening ditches to benefit irrigation is a matter of promoting benefits; building dams to prevent flooding is a matter of eliminating harms. Neither promoting benefits nor eliminating harms can be accomplished under a divided and separatist situation. Because the two major rivers cross six or seven provinces from east to west, if there are two or more opposing regimes among these six or seven provinces, the benefits created by the people upstream cannot be connected with the people downstream, and the harms that the people downstream want to eliminate cannot obtain the cooperation of the people upstream. Not only is it futile, but it is also impossible to start. Moreover, water conservancy projects are huge, costly, and time-consuming. Without a strong and unified organization, it is difficult to carry them out. Therefore, from a historical perspective, many great water conservancy projects were built during times of national unification and universal peace. Whenever there was fragmentation, separation, and turmoil, floods and droughts often occurred year after year. Because of floods and droughts, the people suffered from famine, and because of famine, internal strife arose, and because of internal strife, foreign troubles were invited. Natural disasters and man-made disasters followed like shadows. At this time, the people were barely able to save themselves from death, let alone live and work in peace and contentment? After such a long period of practical experience, the people naturally developed an extremely ardent demand and love for the unity of the country.</p>
<p>Secondly, from the perspective of industry, commerce, and transportation. Although China before today was a country based on agriculture, the gradual development of industry and commerce after the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods is an undeniable fact. The so-called industry in the past of course referred to handicraft industry, and the so-called commerce was nothing more than the exchange of agricultural products and handicraft products. But once the people had exchange activities, it was by no means possible to live peacefully and enjoy their customs in small countries with few people who did not interact with each other until old age. They needed to be connected with each other, they needed transportation to disaster areas, and they needed to exchange goods and make work easier. Therefore, as early as the Zuo Zhuan, it was recorded that: "Juniper and lacquer and leather came from Chu, but although Chu had the materials, Jin actually used them." Economic geographers divide human transportation into periods: the first period is inland river transportation, the second period is inland sea transportation, the third period is ocean transportation, and the fourth period is continental transportation. This periodization is inevitably somewhat modified since the realization of air transportation, but the division of the first three periods is still extremely accurate. China has no inland seas, so before ocean transportation, inland river transportation fulfilled a very long and very important responsibility. China has many tributaries of inland rivers, but the so-called Jiang, Huai, He, Han, and Pearl River, as well as artificially created canals, all pass through at least two or three provinces today. If there were small countries standing like forests within China, with layers of customs barriers, how could one talk about exchanging goods and making work easier? Therefore, from the history of China, every time the country was unified, it was an opportunity for commerce to rise, and once the country was in turmoil, industrial and commercial enterprises inevitably plummeted. The prosperous eras of the Han and Tang Dynasties, as well as the unified eras of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, not only saw the vigorous development of domestic commerce, but also the great prosperity of international trade outside the region. Conversely, during periods such as the Wu Hu Disturbance, the opposition between the Northern and Southern Dynasties, and the great chaos at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, not only did international trade completely stagnate, but all domestic commercial capital also completely collapsed, and the people's economy had to return to a self-sufficient natural state. The so-called merchant class that valued the superficial over the fundamental of the past, they certainly sought only profit, but in the long-term experience of seeking only profit, they also gained an intuitive understanding, that is, if the country is not unified and the situation is not peaceful, their business cannot be done.</p>
<p>Since the people's real life is so closely related to the unity of the country, the ordinary people of China, who for two thousand years seemed to have no abstract concepts such as country and nation, have actually fulfilled extremely great responsibilities of loving and protecting the country and nation. Their love and protection of the country and nation is intuitive, knowing what it is but not knowing why, but their emotions are very real and very sharp. They have an extremely realistic and extremely simple idea: whoever can unify China, they will support him; whoever wants to disrupt China, they will despise him. Because the former can enable them to live and work in peace and contentment, and the latter will cause them to be ruined and die. This idea, of course, sometimes inevitably leads to malpractices, so in the past, sometimes alien races entered and ruled China, and if they could maintain China's long-term unity, the people would live in a state of temporary peace. Therefore, the ancient sages strictly defended the separation between the Yi and Xia, and the modern revolution advocated nationalism, all to correct biases and remedy abuses. But, in any case, the urgency of the Chinese people's demand for unity is conceivable.</p>
<p>This concept is not only held by ordinary people, but also by the so-called intellectual class of scholar-officials. In every change of dynasty, there are always many loyal ministers and righteous men who sacrifice their lives to try to reverse the decline. The formation of this kind of thought and behavior is not purely caused by doctrines, nor is it solely supported by concepts, but is actually reflected from the real lives of the majority of the people and is carried out with the common support of the majority of the people. Because the majority of the people demand permanent unity and fear occasional division, they unconsciously reflect this in the minds of the intellectual class, and they also develop an extremely simple intuition, thinking that changing dynasties, regardless of whether the change is right or wrong, good or bad, during a change, there will be at least ten or several decades of turmoil and unrest, and the world will not be peaceful, and the people will not be able to live and work in peace and contentment. If we want to accomplish something in the course of Chinese history, we should deeply understand this consciousness reflected from the people's real lives and should not neglect it casually.</p>
<p>Today, this situation is even more obvious. The two major rivers that cross east and west still exist, and the two trunk lines that run through north and south—Jinpu, Pinghan, and Yuehan—have also been completed. The foundation of the agricultural economy is deeply rooted, the development of industry and commerce is catching up, the 450 million people of the whole country have formed a large ethnic group, and the vast territory of east, west, north, and south has formed a large economic system. The east and west cannot be split, and the north and south cannot be opposed. The military separatism of the Northern Warlords before the Northern Expedition and the arbitrary division by the enemy and puppets that passed like clouds recently are the most unbearable and unforgettable painful historical period in the lives of the people. The people may be dissatisfied with the current political situation, but they only hope to change the style and do not hope to brew internal strife.</p>
<p>After the Xinhai Revolution, the monarchy was abolished, the autocratic politics was overthrown, and all systems and cultural relics were reformed, which was completely different from the past. However, the situation of great unification formed in China for two thousand years must not be allowed to be destroyed, and it needs to be made even closer and more stable. Therefore, the Founding Father of the Revolution did not hesitate to use a spirit of great fearlessness to overthrow the politics of monarchical autocracy, and immediately created the term "Five Races United as One Republic" to replace it in order to maintain the situation of great unification in China. I can assert that in this way of evolution of Chinese history, although political systems and social organizations can continue to change with the shift of the times, the situation of great unification in China must not be allowed to be destroyed.</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Suddenly Withdraw from Tehran, U.S. Dispatches Delegation to Investigate Northern Iran</h3>
<p>[United Press Tehran, 1st] It was reported here today that Soviet troops had suddenly withdrawn from Tehran starting on Thursday. Transportation hubs at train stations and private residences, including the command headquarters, have all been completely evacuated.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 1st] The State Department announced that the U.S. Embassy in Tehran has dispatched a three-person delegation to Tabriz, the center of the Iranian disturbance. It is believed that this was arranged with the Soviets in Tehran beforehand. The United States suggested last week that foreign troops withdraw from Iran by January 1st of next year, but Britain and the Soviet Union have not yet responded.</p>
<p>Soviet Note Replies to Iran, Denies Interference in Internal Affairs</p>
<p>[Reuters Tehran, 1st] The contents of the note from the Soviet Embassy to the Iranian Foreign Ministry were released today: Not only does the Soviet side refuse to allow Iran to pass through, but it also denies all the points of Iran's accusations against the Soviet side. It is claimed that if more Iranian troops move north, war and bloodshed in northern Iran will be unavoidable. For this reason, the Soviet government has had to increase troops in Iran to protect the Soviet garrison there. However, since the Soviet government does not want to increase troops in Iran, it is best for the Iranian government not to send troops to the northern provinces of Iran. The Soviet note also denies that the Soviet Union has interfered in Iran's politics and economy, and denies that it has aided the Kuchi tribes. The fact that Bassal sneaked into Iran from Iraq has nothing to do with the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the obstacles and difficulties in Iran's plan to establish border outposts on the Iran-Turkey border are also fought by the Soviet Union. The Soviet note claims that the events in northern Iran were actually caused by Iranian gendarmes and officials.</p>
<p>Peace or Preparation for War, People Anxious and Uneasy</p>
<p>The delivery of the Soviet note greatly surprised Iranian political circles, which was completely contrary to the recent expressions of goodwill from Britain, the United States, and Iran. However, shortly after the note was released, officials announced that Soviet troops in Tehran had withdrawn from train stations, transportation hubs, and military camps. The public is still unclear about the intention of this move, whether it is for peace or for preparation for war. It is also rumored that British and American troops have concentrated in Baghdad and southern Iran, but the truth remains to be verified. News from northern Iran said that Soviet troops have dug out war teams to prevent Iranian troops from heading north in case they are unwilling to accept the Soviet refusal. Although the government is trying to stabilize public sentiment, it cannot hide the seriousness of the facts. Merchants in Tehran have moved their families and documents to safe areas in southern Iran, and troops continue to arrive in the capital to deploy defenses and arrange positions in the suburbs.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Decides to Establish Social and Economic Committees, Election of Judges Should Not Be Delayed, Liang Yunli's Proposal Gains Support from Representatives</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 1st] At a meeting of the technical committee of the United Nations General Assembly today, the Ukrainian representative stated that the General Assembly should only establish one main committee on economic and social issues. Dividing these two tasks may cause important social recommendations to go astray. Today's meeting debated the issue of whether to establish one or two economic and social committees based on practical convenience. After the final vote, the proposal by the five major powers to establish two committees in light of the broad scope of work was successful.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 29th] When the Preparatory Committee reviewed the legal issues of the United Nations this evening, the Chinese representative Liang Yunli expressed opposition to the Australian representative's proposal to postpone the election of judges to the International Court of Justice. Liang's reason was that China believes that thorough preparations are necessary for the election of judges, but it is also necessary for the main organs of the United Nations to be established simultaneously. If the International Court of Justice, which symbolizes world justice, is not organized when other main organs are established, it will damage the reputation of the United Nations. Moreover, delaying the establishment of the International Court of Justice may be used as an excuse to set a precedent for delaying other organs. The opinion of the Chinese representative was supported by the American representative Stephen Hess.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Temporary Trusteeship Committee Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 1st] The Yugoslav representative to the technical committee of the United Nations yesterday submitted a counter-proposal to the executive committee's plan to establish a temporary trusteeship council. The three delegations of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia opposed the establishment of a temporary trusteeship council in the executive committee. They insisted on their claim in the preparatory committee for two reasons: (1) this proposal violates the charter, and (2) the establishment of a temporary one will delay the establishment of a permanent one. The counter-proposal submitted by the Yugoslav representative proposes that the draft agreements for entrusting the entrusted powers to place their entrusted lands under trusteeship should be submitted to the first General Assembly of the United Nations, and that a committee on this matter should provide its opinions on the draft agreements to the General Assembly. Therefore, the trusteeship council should be established immediately. The representatives of the five powers of the United Kingdom stated that their representative countries would study the proposals of the Yugoslav representative with sympathy.</p>
<h3>Azerbaijan Province Holds Parliamentary Elections</h3>

<h3>Hess Devises Many Schemes, Pretends to Suffer from Amnesia, Presiding Judge Announces He Is Now Fit to Stand Trial</h3>
<p>[Reuters Nuremberg, 1st] The military tribunal here decided today that Hess, the former deputy leader of Germany who flew to England on a mysterious mission in 1941, must be tried together with the other nineteen major Nazi war criminals. The court continued to open the trial shortly after 9:00 a.m. this morning (5:00 p.m. Shanghai time). Presiding Judge Lorents announced, "Based on various evidence, the court believes that the defendant Hess is now fit to stand trial. Therefore, the motion of the defendant's lawyer should be rejected."</p>
<p>[United Press Nuremberg, 30th] Hess has a terrifying appearance and is naturally cunning. After being captured in England, he seemed to suffer from amnesia. Today, a special inquiry was held to ask whether Hess should continue to be tried. Unexpectedly, Hess read out an astonishing confession, claiming that he was faking amnesia, and the doctors and lawyers of the United Nations were deceived by him. Before the court opened today, Hess only said that he intended to speak in court, but did not explain what he would say.</p>
<h3>Villages Near Ambarawa Bombed Flat by British Troops, Dutch Deputy Governor Says Door to Negotiations Not Closed</h3>
<p>[Reuters Batavia, 1st] Indonesian artillery continued to bombard the expatriate camps in Ambarawa last night without stopping. The British were forced to dispatch ten aircraft to drop 6,000 pounds of bombs and 32 rockets on a target area of 400 square yards. It is said that the villages in the center of the area have been bombed flat. An Allied communiqué added that northern Bandung has been cleared, but did not mention encountering resistance from Indonesians. Oen Galan village between Sambong and Ambarawa was occupied by British Indian troops yesterday. A British military administrative agency has been established in Surabaya.</p>
<p>[Reuters Batavia, 1st] Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook told reporters yesterday that the situation has eased again, so it may be possible to resume negotiations with the Indonesian side. The door to negotiations remains wide open, but when they will be held is still unknown. I believe that no country can allow its citizens to be constantly threatened and allow its enemies to evade fulfilling the terms of surrender. There are many misunderstandings about the issue of Dutch troops. It must be known that this is the land under the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, but Dutch troops are not allowed to rescue their citizens and enforce the terms of surrender. How can this be understood?</p>
<h3>German Prisoners of War Attempt Suicide After Being Extradited from Sweden to Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Swedish Capital, 30th] After Germany surrendered, 3,000 soldiers from Germany, Austria, Poland, and the Baltic countries fled to Sweden and were detained in concentration camps. Because the Soviet Union requested extradition, they were escorted on board by Swedish guards today. The detainees were unwilling to be extradited and resisted with all the weapons they could obtain, turning the concentration camp into a battlefield. Dozens of German soldiers set up obstacles in the barracks and began to commit suicide with knives and razor blades as the guards approached. Swedish guards had to use batons to prevent them from harming their limbs. Others stripped off their clothes, piled into cars, and boarded ships naked. More than seventy German soldiers were injured and fell in one concentration camp.</p>

The most important thing is the proposal on atomic energy, which was proposed by British and American representatives. The Congress also telegraphed the wives of political prisoners in Spain, claiming that the World Women's Congress unanimously condemned Franco's reign of terror and deeply admired the resistance of Spanish men and women to fascism. The Congress's proposal to demand that all countries sever relations with Franco was unanimously passed. No one expressed opposition.</p>

<h3>Special Interview by This Newspaper: Dynamics of Jinan University, the Highest Overseas Chinese Institution: An Interview with Principal He Bingsong by This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Jinan University, the highest institution of learning founded by overseas Chinese, is located in Zhenru, Shanghai, with complete facilities and a grand scale. It was destroyed by enemy artillery fire during the August 13th Incident. Later, it was relocated to Jianyang, Fujian, in the rear, where it was managed diligently and achieved remarkable results. Yesterday morning, this newspaper's reporter visited Principal He Bingsong of the school at his Shanghai residence. Mr. He provided a detailed account of the school's dynamics, as follows: Jinan University was originally located in Zhenru. I (He himself) took office as the school's principal in 1935.</p>
<p>The Zhenru Campus Was Destroyed</p>
<p>During the August 13th Incident, when the War of Resistance broke out, the Zhenru campus was completely destroyed by enemy artillery fire. At that time, in order to avoid interrupting the students' studies, the school was moved to the Shanghai Concession in haste and classes were resumed. Later, when the National Army retreated westward, the school remained on the isolated island and continued classes. When the Pacific War broke out, faced with the harsh environment, it was no longer possible to stay put. I personally led all the teachers and students to the rear.</p>
<p>Relocated to Jianyang for Classes</p>
<p>Over a long distance, traveling a long way, enduring hardship, we arrived in Jianyang, northwest of Jianou County, Fujian. The Confucius Temple in that area was used as Jinan University's office, and ancestral halls and temples were borrowed as school buildings. Thatched houses were built to set up classrooms and classes resumed as usual. However, Jianyang was located in a remote area, and two major difficulties arose at the time: one was the difficulty in purchasing textbooks, and the other was the inability to purchase instruments for science and chemistry.</p>
<p>Solving Two Major Difficulties</p>
<p>After various efforts, textbooks were purchased from distant Fuzhou. All scientific instruments were temporarily borrowed from the Fujian and Zhejiang Provincial Science and Chemistry Research Institute. These two major problems were finally solved. However, it was inconvenient and uneconomical to use temporary scientific instruments. When students needed to conduct experiments, they had to go to the Fujian and Zhejiang Science and Chemistry Research Institute, which was far from the school. Each round trip was very expensive, and all expenses were borne by the school. Currently, there are only three colleges: Arts, Science, and Commerce.</p>
<p>Suggesting the Addition of Colleges</p>
<p>At this moment, as the War of Resistance has ended and national reconstruction has begun, it is urgent to expand the organization. I have submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Education, suggesting that when Jinan University returns to Shanghai to resume operations, a Normal College for Overseas Chinese, a Law College, and a Preparatory Class for Overseas Chinese should be added. Currently, I am in Shanghai, looking for a temporary school building. As a result of this effort, I am afraid that it will not be possible to achieve the goal until after the spring break at the earliest. There are currently more than 1,150 students in Jianyang. In the future, when the entire group packs up and returns to Shanghai, it will be necessary to put in a lot of effort and make advance arrangements.</p>

<h3>City Government Receives Press Corps: Deputy Mayor He Assumed Office Yesterday: He Expresses That He Comes to Serve as a Public Servant, Not as an Official: He Hopes to Alleviate the People's Suffering</h3>
<p>Shanghai Deputy Mayor He De Kui assumed office at the City Government at 9:00 AM yesterday. Party, government, military, and people from all walks of life in the city flocked to the City Government to congratulate him. All gifts from various parties were declined. Mayor Qian Dajun received reporters from local newspapers at the City Government Auditorium yesterday afternoon. Deputy Mayor He De Kui and the heads of various bureaus also participated. During the meeting, Mayor Qian first introduced Deputy Mayor He, who assumed office yesterday. Then, Deputy Mayor He delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Mr. He's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated: Today, Shanghai's municipal affairs are complex and varied. Governance does not require many words, so please excuse me for not elaborating at this time. I come from the people, not to be an official, but to be a public servant for the people. I am determined to act in good conscience. On the passive side, I at least hope to alleviate the people's suffering. On the active side, I should seek happiness for the citizens. I hope that Shanghai will develop into an ideal metropolis under Mayor Qian's leadership. To achieve this goal, I also hope that all the citizens of Shanghai, the Shanghai press, and allied friends will provide cooperation, either in spirit or in economy and technology.</p>
<p>Mayor Qian's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Qian delivered a speech in four sections: First, the recent establishment of a news release group by the City Government not only allows the staff of this government to concentrate on their work, but also provides more convenience for reporters from various newspapers to gather news. This is not to block news, but to facilitate both internal and external information flow. Second, municipal construction involves numerous tasks. Since the establishment of this government only eighty days ago, we often see criticisms or suggestions from various newspapers regarding municipal administration. We have adopted about 50% of them based on our consideration. Those that are temporarily difficult to implement due to practical difficulties are also being planned comprehensively. I deeply feel that the future of municipal construction involves many departments, and there is no end to the work. My colleagues in this government will definitely work hard. Although we are not confident about the results, we will humbly accept well-intentioned instructions and criticisms. Third, Shanghai is a cosmopolitan city with both Chinese and foreigners. In serving the local area, my supervision of subordinates may be insufficient. Eliminating corruption and cultivating clean politics is the established policy of this government, and we are determined to implement it thoroughly. I have repeatedly warned my subordinates to comply. I hope that you gentlemen of the press will report any misconduct that you see or hear. If such misconduct is verified after investigation, we will punish it severely. Fourth, I also serve as the Commander of the Songhu Garrison. The preparations for all the facilities of the command are completely consistent with the City Government. I am responsible for maintaining the city's public security. We are currently arranging winter defense work. All news related to the command will be released by the news release group.</p>
<p>Answering Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>Finally, reporters from various newspapers raised questions about municipal facilities, local public security, and other issues, which were answered separately as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of police treatment, Police Chief Xuan Tiewu answered that in order to remedy the livelihood problems of the police, he has been in contact with various rice merchants to purchase rice at fair prices. Recently, many theft cases have been solved, and more than 100 people have been arrested. To increase the police force in the city, he has recruited police officers from eastern Zhejiang. The first batch of more than 700 people will arrive in Shanghai within days. At the same time, there are more than 500 people, including those who have been reinstated and new recruits, who will also complete training and be dispatched to various bureaus within days. (2) Regarding the City Government properties sold by the enemy puppets, Mayor Qian said that the City Government's real estate sold by the enemy puppets will be unconditionally recovered. The properties sold by the authorities of the former French Concession during the Vichy period will also be treated the same way. (3) Regarding the city's traffic problems, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zeng responded that all trolleybuses and public buses in the city are very crowded due to a lack of vehicles. Within the possible scope, the French Tram Company has been ordered to find ways to add third-class carriages. (4) Regarding the issue of coordinating traffic lines, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang told reporters that the city's docks are being repaired.</p>
<h3>Ship Allocation Committee Established Yesterday: Gong Xuesui Presided Over the Meeting: Navy-Received Ships Still Awaiting Handling</h3>
<p>The National Ship Allocation Committee was officially established in Chongqing and Shanghai yesterday and began operations on the same day. The Chongqing Ship Allocation Committee is responsible for ship allocation matters above Hankou, with Lu and as the Deputy Directors. The Shanghai Ship Allocation Committee is responsible for ship allocation matters below Hankou and along the coast, and it is run by Mr. Liu Hongsheng and Xu Xueyu. The establishment of the committee is of great importance to the future development of China's shipping industry. Vice Minister Gong Xuesui of the Ministry of Transportation took a train from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday morning to attend the meeting and provide guidance. In the afternoon, he inspected the ships received and transferred to the committee by the Navy Headquarters with senior officials of the Allocation Committee. At 4:00 PM, the Allocation Committee held a principal meeting at its location on the Bund of Wuma Road. Vice Minister Gong asked the attendees for a lot of information and provided guidance. Vice Minister Gong is scheduled to return to Nanjing within days and will travel to Hankou to inspect the ship reception situation.</p>
<p>[Dagong Society Report] The only ships that have not yet been received are a batch from the Navy Headquarters. The number and names of these ships have not yet been determined. Director Yang, the representative of the Navy Headquarters in the inspection team, stated that he has decided to follow the central government's will to concentrate the ships and hand them over to the Allocation Committee for handling. In addition, the Emei ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was renamed Jinjiang after being occupied by the enemy, has been found in Nanjing. It was taken over by the Navy and first renamed Heping (Peace), and recently renamed Dingan.</p>
<h3>Enemy Property Handling Bureau: Sells Sugar at a Discounted Price: Price Set at 600 Yuan Per Jin</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Area Enemy Property Review and Handling Committee held its fifteenth meeting on the 1st and resolved: (1) To entrust the Sugar Industry Association Reorganization Committee with the average distribution of the first batch of enemy property sugar stored in the Handling Bureau's warehouse to various retailers, and to provide it to all consumers at a fair price. The price is set at 600 yuan per jin, and each household is allowed to purchase half a jin. It is stipulated that if sugar traders and retailers do not comply, they will be fined 100 times the selling price.</p>
<p>Warehouse and Wharf Management Division</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the wharves and warehouses that have been received, those that originally belonged to the enemy and puppets will be managed and used by the Jianghai Customs. Various agencies and merchants may rent them from the Jianghai Customs. Those that belong to Allied neutral countries or Chinese merchants, after the applicant submits a request for investigation, will be returned to the original owners. The warehouses and wharves built by the Municipal Government and the former Concession Public Works Bureau and French Municipal Council will still be managed by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Allied Vehicles Can Be Requested for Return</p>
<p>(3) The main points of the method for returning vehicles to Allied officials and civilians are: When applying for the return of vehicles belonging to Allied officials and merchants, the applicant should send a letter to the Enemy Property Handling Bureau, along with information on the type, make, year, model, engine number, license plate number of the vehicle, as well as various documents proving ownership, and a certificate of reliable guarantee, and the certificate of the management agency. The letter should request that the Enemy Property Handling Bureau and the Municipal Public Works Bureau verify the information and determine if the vehicle should be returned. If the applicant can, as much as possible, indicate the name of the agency currently using or keeping the vehicle, and the current location where it is parked, the handling will be even more convenient. However, if the vehicle has had a sales relationship, it needs to be further verified and processed.</p>
<h3>Chen Yi Flew Back to Taipei Due to Fog in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Taiwan Provincial Governor Chen Yi flew from Tainan to Shanghai the night before last. He flew back to Taiwan by plane at 11:00 AM yesterday. According to a Central News Agency reporter, Chen originally planned to fly from Tainan to Taipei for inspection, but he learned in the plane that Taipei was shrouded in heavy fog, so he temporarily turned back. He flew to Shanghai on the same plane to meet with Commander Tang and meet with relevant personnel to discuss everything. After that, he flew to Taipei on the same plane yesterday morning to continue his inspection.</p>
<h3>100,000 Chinese Laborers Still in the Sea of Suffering: Over a Thousand Overseas Chinese Arrived at Wusong Yesterday</h3>
<p>One Bowl of Rice a Day and One Single Layer of Clothing All Year Round in Life in Japan</p>
<p>The Japanese ship "Mingyou Maru" (formerly mistranslated as "Mingwan Maru"), which is carrying the first batch of our compatriots detained in Japan to return home, docked and anchored at the Jiangmian River about 10,000 yards outside Wusongkou at 6:40 AM yesterday. A Central News Agency reporter took a special ship to visit the ship outside Wusongkou in the afternoon yesterday. The following are the details of the situation:</p>
<p>Sailed Out of Japan on the 10th of Last Month</p>
<p>The Mingyou Maru sailed out of Hokkaido, Japan on the 10th of last month, arrived in Kyushu on the 15th, sailed from Kyushu to Shanghai at noon on the 27th, and arrived outside Wusongkou yesterday morning. Upon learning the news, the reporter borrowed a small fire transport ship "Green Ship" from the Navy Headquarters and departed from the Navy Headquarters pier at 11:10 AM. The "Mingyou Maru" was anchored in the Jiangmian River more than 10,000 yards outside the port. The ship's hull was light gray and weighed 5,200 tons. The overseas Chinese on the ship were overjoyed to see the reporter boarding the ship. There were a total of 1,379 overseas Chinese on the ship, divided into seven teams, namely the Shanghai team led by Jia Mingli, the Muroran City teams 1 to 3 led by Wu Jinsheng and Li Bingheng, the Autumn team led by Wang Lifu, the Kakuta team led by Shen Jieren, and the Otani team led by Chen Runquan. All of the above were male Chinese laborers in Japan. The Shanghai and Kakuta teams were miners, and the rest were mostly miners.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Painfully Recount Their Experiences in Japan</p>
<p>According to them, around July 20, 1944, the Sino-Japanese Labor Service Association had two people in charge, a Japanese man named Ito and a Chinese traitor named Zhou Zhiwei, who were responsible for recruiting Chinese laborers in Shanghai. They stated that they would be going to Taiwan to work and used various sweet words as bait. They also used deceptive means to drive them onto Japanese ships. However, when the ship docked, they realized that they had arrived in Hokkaido, Japan. After that, they were deceived by the Japanese and forced to work as miners. They were only given one bowl of rice a day and one layer of clothing all year round. Hokkaido's climate was cold, and the snow in winter was about twenty feet deep. They were only wearing single-layer clothing, but they were still working under the whip of the Japanese until Japan surrendered. They never received any wages. It was not until August 14 of this year that they received the news of victory. Around the 20th of that month, they all stopped working and used force to resist and demand the wages they had been owed for years in Japan. The Japanese then paid them a small amount of Japanese currency, but immediately sold various daily necessities at high prices, cashing in the money that had been issued. Therefore, the lives of the thousands of overseas Chinese who returned on the Mingyou Maru are extremely painful. Most of them wear old Japanese military uniforms. One of the overseas Chinese had five US dollars, which made him a millionaire on the ship.</p>
<p>Chen's Wife Escorted to Shanghai on the Same Ship</p>
<p>The thousands of overseas Chinese who returned this time, with the exception of a few who had received secondary education or higher, were mostly Chinese laborers. However, because they had been away from their motherland for a long time, they asked the reporter about the domestic situation and were particularly concerned about domestic political issues. Many people were also concerned about the prices of goods in Shanghai, as most of them had gone from Shanghai. The overseas Chinese led the reporter to visit their cabins, which were mostly simple. They cooked their own meals in each team. The ship is scheduled to enter the port at noon on the 3rd and dock at the Qiujiang pier. The Japanese expatriates to be repatriated will be concentrated at Shanghai Jiang University in Yangshupu today. Tomorrow, the customs and military police will conduct an inspection before boarding the ship to return home. It is also learned that the Mingyou Maru does carry several people, imprisoned in a room, that the public believes are the wife of Chen Gongbo and others.</p>
<h3>Third Route Army Headquarters Moves from Shanghai to Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Mr. Zhang, Deputy Commander of the Third Route Army, who spoke to our reporter yesterday, the army headquarters and the Shanghai-Nanjing Garrison Headquarters are moving from Shanghai to Wuxi for ease of command. Preparations are largely complete, and operations are scheduled to begin on the 5th. In Shanghai, a command post will be established separately. The Shanghai Port Command, the Japanese Nationals Management Office, the Political Department, and the Press Liaison Office will remain in Shanghai. Commander Tang and Deputy Commander Zheng are scheduled to go to Wuxi soon to oversee matters. When asked about the recent security situation on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, General Zhang said that everything is currently under control and that there will be a concrete plan to deal with the entire issue. Commander Tang went to Hangzhou yesterday morning to inspect the defenses along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line and will return to Shanghai in a day or two.</p>
<p>Also, the Third Route Army Military Supplies Receiving Committee is rushing the handover. The Shanghai area has already been completed, and Suzhou and Jiashan will also be completed soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Third Route Army Prisoner of War Management Office has been ordered to abolish its original business, which will be taken over by the Japanese Nationals Management Office.</p>
<h3>Prisoner Abuser, Miki, Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After four months of diligent searching by the American War Criminals Unit, Miki, a former Japanese administrator of the Northeast Hedong Prisoner Camp, was finally captured in the Hongkou district of Shanghai. His crimes included subjecting American prisoners of war to various forms of abuse, torture, and whipping, exhausting the limits of cruelty, and confiscating medical supplies from the Red Cross, resulting in the death of over two hundred of the camp's twelve hundred prisoners. He confessed that he had been disbanded from the army in 1944 and came to Shanghai to look for work.</p>
<h3>Relief Supplies Shipped to China, Nine More Vessels to Arrive</h3>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has shipped supplies to China. Six ships have arrived in Shanghai recently, including large quantities of food, staple foods, trucks, old clothes, and old shoes, totaling about 50,000 tons. These have been transferred by the UNRRA Shanghai branch to the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for distribution to national branches and relevant agencies. It has been learned that another nine ships with UNRRA relief supplies are en route to Shanghai, totaling over 70,000 tons, which will arrive in Shanghai successively before the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Methods for Handling Labor Strikes Determined</h3>
<p>The joint conference of the Shanghai municipal Party, government, and military departments to handle labor strikes recently held a meeting and decided on the following methods for handling labor strikes in the city: (1) Regarding the relief of unemployed workers, those whose employers have already paid each worker more than 1.5 million in puppet currency will not be paid any further; those who have received less than this amount may be supplemented. (2) Workers who have left the factory for a long time shall not be entitled to request severance pay, relief funds, or maintenance fees.</p>
<h3>China-Ordered "Zhongshan" Passenger Ship Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>-- To participate in international routes --</p>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Anti-Japanese War, the government has paid great attention to the shipping industry. Before the victory, it ordered two 10,000-ton passenger ships from the United States, named the "Zhongshan" and the "Zhongtong" (transliteration). The "Zhongshan" loaded over 60,000 bags of relief supplies and flour, tens of thousands of pairs of leather shoes, and 30,000 pieces of dairy milk for passengers and cargo, and 10,000 boxes of high-quality foreign wine in San Francisco, and set off for Shanghai. It entered the port on the evening of the 30th of last month and sailed directly to the Dalae Wharf in Bailianjing, South Huangpu, to unload cargo. The two passenger ships are temporarily represented by the Dalae President Shipping Company. It is reported that the "Zhongshan" will stay in Shanghai for two weeks to transport goods to the United States, and the "Zhongtong" will also arrive in Shanghai soon. From now on, Chinese ships will participate in international routes, opening a new era for the Chinese shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jingen, Who Served as Enemy Translator, Is Tried</h3>
<p>Judge Cao of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai Higher Court publicly tried the case of traitor Zhang Jingen at the court's Second Tribunal at 10:00 AM yesterday. The defendant, Zhang Jingen, 21 years old, from Dinghai, residing at 99 West Street, Jiading, served as a foreman for the Japanese troops in Jiading during the enemy puppet era, acting as their accomplice and harming the people. He was arrested by military authorities and sent to the court according to law. After taking his seat, Judge Cao had the bailiffs bring the prisoner to the court and asked him about his involvement in traitorous activities. According to Zhang, he responded to the recruitment of laborers by the Japanese Mori Detachment in Jiading in March of this year to carry white rice on ships and store it in warehouses, which were strictly guarded by the Japanese. The court inquired about the condition of the warehouse, which he said was very large and could store the food for twenty ships, each ship holding more than two hundred bags of rice. His daily wage was 1,000 yuan in puppet currency and one catty of rice. Over time, he learned some Japanese and became a translator, earning an extra catty of rice per day. Asked why he took this job, he replied that it was due to livelihood pressures. After the victory, he came to Shanghai to attend a friend's wedding feast and temporarily stayed at the Yipinxian room opened by his friend Zhao Shengchang (who served as a Japanese translator), where he was arrested by the military authorities. The court asked where Zhao was from. He replied that he was from Shanghai and did not know his residence. The judge ordered the defendant to be remanded into custody.</p>
<p>Public Trial of Traitor Cases</p>
<p>According to officials in charge of judicial organs yesterday, traitors are public enemies of the people, and the people in the occupied areas who have suffered from their poison are all deeply grieved. Therefore, the court attaches great importance to the opening of traitor trials and makes them absolutely public. The judicial personnel handling this case reside in the court and do not contact the outside world. The Shanghai and other courts have only about twenty traitor cases awaiting trial.</p>
<h3>Robbery in Duofu Lane Solved</h3>
<p>The home of Madam You, a Suzhou woman, at 56 Duofu Lane (i.e., Fuxu Road) in Zhongzheng Road, was broken into by six robbers at around 8:00 PM the night before. They brandished pistols, ransacked the house, and robbed gold bars, jewelry, diamond rings, and legal currency, estimated to be worth over 2 million yuan. After the incident, the victim reported to the New City Division, who after investigation, learned that the suspects were hiding at 48 Ningbo Road in the former French Concession. They led police officers to arrest them. At the time, the robber Hu Shanlin, a native of Pudong, attempted to resist arrest and was shot in the right foot by the police officers and captured. Subsequently, Xu Genfa and five other men and two women were arrested at No. 10 Yong'an Street, A Building, upstairs in the Great Shanghai Factory, and five pistols were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Race Creates a Sensation in Shanghai; Miss Qiong Nanqie Crowned Queen</h3>
<p>The widely publicized rickshaw race was held at 1:00 PM yesterday. Starting from the Bund on Sanma Road, passing Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, turning into Ximor Road, and ending at Yaber Road. The champion was Qiong Nanqie (Russian nationality), rickshaw driver Jiang Ermao. Second place was Betty (Russian nationality), rickshaw driver Pan Shaowen. Third place was Miss Gong (Chinese nationality), rickshaw driver Xu Jin. After the race, an awards ceremony was held at the Yiyuan Stadium, presided over by General Wedemeyer.</p>
<p>At the same time, the U.S. Army and Navy held a soccer match, with brilliant performances. As a result, the Navy soccer team defeated the Army with a score of 12 to 0.</p>
<p>Huili Ball Stadium Crowded</p>
<p>At one o'clock yesterday afternoon, lacking a quarter, the Huili Ball Stadium on Yaber Road was already crowded. American military vehicles of all sizes drove straight toward the Huili Ball Stadium in twos and threes. Suddenly arriving at the stadium, thousands of American Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel were sitting neatly around the perimeter. Just after sitting down, the broadcast reported that the rickshaw race was on the way. In a few minutes, it would be arriving here. Sure enough, in less than ten minutes—at one thirty-five—the middle was shouting loudly, it was reported that the number seventeen rickshaw had reached the finish line. Immediately following was number sixteen, Miss Betty of the U.S. 10th Air Force, and the rickshaw of Miss Gong, number fifteen. The Allied troops sat down for a moment and then got up and shouted. As one by one, rickshaws arrived. The last three numbers were eleven, nineteen, and seven. Several ladies, although lagging behind, still clenched their fists and shouted for the rickshaw drivers to pull forward when they arrived at the stadium. The poor rickshaw coolies were so tired that they could not lift their heads.</p>
<p>The Birth of the Rickshaw Queen</p>
<p>The first place, "Rickshaw Miss"—Qiong Nanqie, weighing 115 pounds, represented the U.S. Port Command. She wore a long gray coat, white earrings, and black hair, with a bun in the back. Surrounded by photographers, she sat in the rickshaw holding fresh flowers. The other ladies similarly moved aside to let the camera take various shots.</p>
<p>The first-place rickshaw driver, Jiang Ermao, wore a grass-green woolen hat, a white sports shirt with a V-shaped "Port Quartermaster" written on the front, and shorts. This number seventeen rickshaw was indeed the most beautifully decorated, with red, blue, and white cloth covering the wheels, and the rickshaw body painted in red, blue, and white.</p>
<p>The announcer announced that the soccer match would begin immediately. The Army side brought out a pony, while the Navy side brought out a sheep. The American troops then raised their spirits and became very excited. The reporters' cameras also changed direction, and the soccer match began amidst the national anthems of China and the United States (sung by a Miss Diistis).</p>
<p>An ambulance was parked in one corner of the stadium, and the Red Cross service team was in the opposite corner. While the game was underway, the announcer told everyone the good news that the Red Cross had brought 20,000 "hot dogs" and coffee to serve. Immediately, a large group of Navy and Air Force personnel went to the Red Cross announcement site.</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer Presents Prizes</p>
<p>Halfway through the soccer match, the rickshaw miss awards ceremony was held. General Wedemeyer, General Stremeyer, and Colonel Joe, the commander of the Yangtze River Patrol, jointly presented the awards. A large silver cup was placed on a small long table, and there were eighteen other silver cups of various sizes. Each lady could receive a silver cup. The ladies lined up and went forward to receive their awards one by one. Only Miss Nanqie, wearing a short red and black plaid coat, a short black skirt, and a white shirt, sat in the rickshaw. The rickshaw driver stood in front of the rickshaw, and Colonel Joe personally placed a garland around the neck of the number seventeen rickshaw driver. Jiang Ermao was flattered and could only grin widely. Then General Wei personally handed the large silver cup to Miss Nanqie. Miss Nanqie stood up, held the silver cup, turned around to face the audience, and was photographed by the press reporters for this historic photo. The ladies also had to cope with the reporters' questions and were overwhelmed. Miss Nanqie and her rickshaw driver were also asked by the reporters to go to the grass field for official photography. The military band played, and the second half started, so the "Rickshaw Miss" went down to rest.</p>
<p>The First Place Rickshaw Driver Receives a Bonus</p>
<p>The first-place rickshaw driver received 2 million yuan in puppet currency, the second place 1.5 million yuan, and the third place 1 million yuan. The others also received prizes.</p>
<p>The most distinctive rickshaw in terms of color was number nine, which Miss Ribeiro of Rome sat in, painted in deep yellow.</p>
<p>Four Chinese ladies participated, of which Miss Gong (rickshaw number fifteen) won third place, wearing black clothes, representing the U.S. Port W Command.</p>
<p>Miss Huang (number six) won fourteenth place, representing the Deputy Headquarters of the Signal Room. Miss Wang (number eighteen) won sixteenth place, representing the U.S.-China Headquarters. Finally, Miss Li (number seven) representing the Signal Room, came in last.</p>
<p>Race Highlights</p>

According to him, he has been pulling rickshaws for more than fifteen years.

<h3>Social Service - Launching Relief Efforts - Appealing for Donations from All Parties</h3>
<p>Four Relief Efforts - At Least 2 Million Yuan - Impoverished People Petition - Emotions Very Sad</p>
<p>Our office has recently received dozens of letters daily from unemployed groups, and many have come to the office to express their grievances in person. The words of complaint in the letters are truly a tear in every word, very sad! Unemployment is indeed the most bitter encounter, and economic hardship is an especially painful pressure; in the current Shanghai life, even those with jobs feel stretched to the limit, let alone those who are idle and unproductive? Their requests: The first is to hope to find employment, the second is to hope to borrow "small loans" to do some small business to maintain their livelihood. The reasons are very proper, and the circumstances are fully sincere. We express twelve points of sympathy. Unfortunately, the donations saved in our office are very small. In addition to scholarships, combined with aid for children's education, medical aid, midwifery aid, and small loans, the total amount is only more than 60,000 yuan. If distributed to four relief efforts, it is really difficult. Without rice to cook, what can we do!</p>
<p>Now, everything is expensive. Speaking of "small loans," each person needs at least a loan of 5,000 yuan. If we approve loans for 100 people, we need to raise 500,000 yuan to cope with it. As for rescuing orphans without fathers or mothers and sending them to various educational institutions; rescuing the generally poor and sick and sending them to various hospitals for medical treatment and medicine; and helping poor pregnant women and sending them to contracted hospitals for delivery, each of these four relief efforts requires a minimum fund of 50,000 yuan, totaling 2 million yuan, to gradually promote each item and start our practical work. Today, with twelve ten thousand points of sincerity, I call on all enthusiastic and powerful people in the world to generously donate and contribute more, and to thank the people in need with nine prostrations!</p>
<h3>Bear the Cost of Rice to Protect Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients</h3>
<p>During the war, the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis increased due to poor living conditions. Shanghai has a dense population, and according to statistics over the years, pulmonary tuberculosis has always ranked first, endangering national health and threatening public safety. As the Anti-Japanese War has been won and peace has returned, we should identify all latent tuberculosis factors to restore their health as soon as possible, cooperate in production, eradicate infection, and seek public safety. We hereby appeal to major hospitals to cooperate and establish the following simple rules:</p>
<p>(1) Anti-Tuberculosis Movement for Victory in the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>(2) All students of Shenxin and Erbao who receive student loans and teachers who receive food aid will receive free examinations, simply by presenting their credentials directly to the hospitals. To save procedures, no registration is required in advance, and no separate notice will be issued. We hope that scholarship students will actively go for examinations and not sacrifice this free examination opportunity.</p>
<p>(3) All students and teachers of various schools in the city and their direct relatives, as well as the working class in the city, only need to prepare an official letter or credentials for half-price examination.</p>
<p>(4) For those who are found to have lung disease and need to undergo compression surgery (artificial pneumothorax), if they cannot afford it, this column will pay the hospitals a subsidy of 10,000 yuan per person per year. (According to the current situation, 10,000 yuan is only equivalent to one stone of white rice, which can be used to rescue a pulmonary tuberculosis patient as soon as possible. Is this the way to use the lowest economic power to maximize the effect!) This "Bear the Cost of Rice to Protect Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients" movement is an urgent need for active relief. Saving one person is equivalent to saving a whole family. We hope that enthusiastic people will generously donate and contribute to promote it. We are very fortunate!</p>
<p>Location - Hospital Name: All major hospitals above can be visited for examination during outpatient hours.</p>
<p>Deadline - From now until the end of December this year. No extension will be granted.</p>
<h3>Letter Seeking Information on Father Lu Songnian</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I recently received a letter from Ms. Lu Manying of Chongqing, seeking information on her father, Lu Songnian. Her words were very sad. Please publish it in your newspaper. The Shanghai Rice Industry Guild Organizing Committee on behalf of Ms. Lu.</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Shenbao Social Service Department: My father, Songnian, and my brother, Congliang, were originally from Liuhe and lived in Shanghai for many years, making a living by running a rice business. (The family originally lived at No. 10 Miaolong Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, but now I don't know where they moved to? And whether the family still exists? Because the letter has been returned, I can't remember where he was originally in Shanghai. Because I was young when I escaped). Unfortunately, the "August 13th" Shanghai War broke out. I was adopted by my aunt and hastily escaped. Unfortunately, my aunt died in Jiaxing in an enemy bombing. I have suffered hardships for eight years and have come to Chongqing after many twists and turns. Although I have sent many letters home, they have all disappeared. I am lonely and drifting in a foreign land. I miss my relatives and home all the time. It is extremely painful! I hope your newspaper will publish it to find out where "Lu Songnian" is currently living? If any benevolent gentleman or friend of my father knows his whereabouts, please pass on the message or forward it through your column. I am very grateful. Sincerely, Lu Manying November 24 (Please forward to Mr. Zhou Jianguo, Police Station, Political Department, Sansheng Palace, Chongqing)</p>
<p>Letter from Mr. Xu Yaolin: I humbly request that when I worked at a certain company, I had a deposit of 10,000 yuan (in February of the 27th year of the Republic of China). Now, because of my resignation, the deposit will be returned. However, it is paid in legal currency at a rate of one to one. However, it is found that at that time, 10,000 yuan in legal currency could buy a thousand stones of rice, but now it can only buy one stone. The loss is too great. It is really difficult to work with people. I don't know where to appeal for a fair solution. I dare to ask you to explain in detail so that I can follow suit. Thank you.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) This newspaper is not in a position to reply to this. You may ask the Industrial and Commercial Section of the Social Affairs Bureau or the Certified Public Accountants Association to study and verify it.</p>

<h3>Shirley Temple Gets Married</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>Shirley Temple, the world-famous child star, was recently married in the Wilshire Church in Hollywood.</p>
<p>The groom is John Agar, 24 years old, a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force. Shirley Temple met him at a banquet two years ago. After two years of passionate love, they finally got married.</p>
<p>For Shirley's wedding this time, her parents tried their best to save money and did not want to make a show of it. They only invited 500 old friends to participate in the wedding. However, this matter alarmed a group of movie fans, and it is unknown how many people went to see the bride. They crowded the church so tightly that the bride and groom waited for a whole fifteen minutes before squeezing out.</p>
<p>At the wedding banquet, a Gypsy band played music, and the guests toasted in turn, drinking a total of twenty boxes of champagne. Gifts piled up on nine large vegetable tables.</p>
<p>Whether Shirley plans to make a new movie after her marriage or go to college, she still cannot decide. However, this child star, who had accumulated 3 million US dollars at the age of eleven and caused a sensation at the time, has now become a new bride. From now on, she will not be Shirley Temple, but Mrs. Agar. We watched Shirley's films as a child, and it seems like it was not long ago, but now we hear that she is married. Is this not a sigh for the passage of time? A group of movie fans in the United States said: Shirley's marriage makes everyone feel old.</p>
<h3>The Shortest Play Review</h3>
<p>— Hu Bei</p>
<p>Theater critics watch plays every day, and when they get tired of them, sometimes they see bad plays and write reviews that are quite hilarious. The famous American theater critic Atkinson once wrote the shortest play review: "A certain play was performed last night. Why?"</p>
<p>Another theater critic criticized an opera company, saying that it "came to town to perform after an insufficient number of postponements."</p>
<p>Film critic Ratner criticized the film "Panama Hattie," saying, "This film seems to be missing something, probably burial."</p>
<p>Theater critic Rascoe said that a certain actress's expression made him "feel sick." The next day, that actress bought a bottle of castor oil and sent it to him.</p>
<p>After watching a very bad play, a stranger asked theater critic Kaufman, "What did you think of the play?" Kaufman replied, "It would be unfair for me to criticize it. I watched this play under extremely unfortunate circumstances... while being pulled upwards."</p>
<h3>Divine Acting</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>The American movie star Paul Muni is particularly good at playing characters with special personalities. Once, he was performing as a representative of miners in a theater, demanding a wage increase from a heartless mine owner. At the end of the second act, after he demanded a wage increase, the mine owner refused and kicked him out. One night, Paul Muni's whole family came to see the play, and Paul Muni performed even more diligently. He used his extraordinary eloquence to describe the starvation of the miners' wives and children. At the most moving moment of the performance, the actor playing the mine owner couldn't help but be moved, bursting into tears and shouting, "Okay! Okay! You've broken my heart. Of course, your wages can be increased!" The head of the troupe, seeing the situation was not good, quickly called down the curtain. Before the start of the third act, the theater manager had to run to the front of the stage to explain that the mine owner later changed his mind and refused to increase the miners' wages.</p>
<h3>Charles Laughton's New Work</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>"Charles Laughton has never made a bad film," this is probably a fact recognized by film fans.</p>
<p>In 1945, Charles Laughton made a big-budget film about 18th-century pirates, "Captain Kidd." This was adapted from a novel by Robert N. Lee, directed by Rowland V. Lee, and distributed by United Artists.</p>
<p>"Captain Kidd," if not said to be a sister work of "Mutiny on the Bounty," has a very grand scale. In addition to Charles Laughton, the stars include Randolph Scott, John Carradine, and Gilbert Roland; Barbara Britton is the only woman in the film. Charles Laughton plays Captain Kidd with refined acting skills, and he himself believes that this film is one of his most satisfying works in recent years.</p>
<p>"Captain Kidd" features a historic Spanish ship, 200 feet high and 75 feet wide, with a spacious deck. The sophistication of its manufacture and the huge amount of money spent on it are probably unmatched even by the large ships that sailed the ocean 250 years ago. However, it is only occasionally used to sail on a fake ocean in a photography studio. This historic Spanish ship first appeared in "The Sea Hawk" starring Laurence Olivier, and later in "The Black Swan," starring Tyrone Power, Laird Cregar, and Maureen O'Hara (this film is Valentino's masterpiece), and in "The Princess and the Pirate" starring Bob Hope and Victor McLaglen. The history of this ship is also an interesting little movie story!</p>
<h3>Theater Talk</h3>
<p>— Shen Yin</p>
<p>Good drama is like good music, it not only stirs people's emotions but also inspires people's wisdom. – Gabriel</p>
<p>Great drama always contains great meaning. – Jial</p>
<p>Can you tell me a drama greater than life? – Law Fag</p>
<h3>Affairs of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Master</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu had always had dealings with Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, and was therefore hated by the enemy puppets. Twice he came south, and was insulted by puppet police and constables at the Beijing Railway Station, so he resolutely took off his opera costume and took up a hoe, becoming a farmer in the Western Hills.</p>
<p>Kunqu actress Wang Yuhua (Xin Yanqiu) performed at the Jixiang Theater in Beijing in 1938. Because she was implicated in a bombing case, she was falsely accused by enemy constables and subjected to severe punishment. Later, she was bailed out by Jiang Chaozong and finally escaped the clutches of the devil.</p>
<p>Since the death of Tan Dawang, Yu Shuyan can be called a master of his generation, but unfortunately, heaven did not grant him many years, and he also died of illness the following year.</p>
<p>Zhou Xinfang was quite unsuccessful before the war. After the July 7th Incident, Xinfang returned from Tianjin and performed "Dong Xiaowan" and other plays at the Carlton, which went smoothly and accumulated a fortune.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Enemy (11)</h3>
<p>— Pearl S. Buck, Translated by Zhu Qi</p>
<p>The cook said proudly, "The young master saves anyone because he has the skill to save people from death." She skillfully cut open the neck of a chicken, grabbed the struggling chicken, and sprinkled its blood on the roots of a wisteria flower. Blood is the best fertilizer, and the old gardener does not allow her to waste a single drop.</p>
<p>Yoko said worriedly, "We must think of the children. If their father is convicted of treason, what will become of them?"</p>
<p>They were not afraid that Hana would hear them as they spoke. Hana was standing very close to them, arranging the flowers on the western porch. She also knew that they were deliberately talking to her. She also knew that their words were correct. But there was another part of her, which she herself did not understand, which was not the fond kind of softness about the prisoner. Now she thought of him as a prisoner. Yesterday he had cried out, "At least let me tell you, my name is Tom." Even then, she had not welcomed him. She bowed slightly and distantly. She saw the hurt in his eyes, but she did not want to comfort him. He was indeed a great problem in this house.</p>
<p>As for Sadao, he examined the wound carefully every day. This morning, the last stitches of the wound were also removed. In two weeks, this man could be considered completely healed. Sadao returned to his office and carefully typed a letter to the police station reporting the whole thing. He typed, "On February 21st, an escaped prisoner was washed ashore in front of my house." Then he pulled open a secret drawer in his desk and put the unfinished report inside.</p>
<p>On the seventh day after this happened, two things happened. In the morning, all the servants packed their luggage in large bundles and left together. When Hana got up in the morning, she saw that nothing had been done in the house, the rooms had not been cleaned, and breakfast had not been prepared. She knew what this meant. She panicked, even felt terrified, but the pride of the mistress of the house prevented her from showing it at all. When they saw her in the kitchen, she solemnly bowed slightly to them, settled their wages, and thanked them for all the work they had done for her in the past. They all cried, but she did not cry.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Association Stipulates Legal Profit of Rice Shops Not to Exceed 6%</h3>
<p>Rice reserves have increased, and market prices have fallen by 600-700 yuan yesterday. All goods have returned to the 10,000 yuan mark. According to the Rice Industry Association, the selling price of any rice sold by rice shops must not exceed 6% of the transaction price of the rice market (excluding cartage). Extra price increases are strictly prohibited. At the same time, retail sales should be marked with the selling price so that buyers can understand at a glance.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Market</h3>
<p>Raw Silk: Yesterday, it was stimulated by international news and was popular as soon as it entered the market. After breaking through the 800,000 mark, there was more profit-taking, and it suffered a slight setback. It hovered in the middle of the session, but the selling pressure was still strong. It continued to weaken in the afternoon and closed slightly lower than before. The foreign exchange listing rumored that it would be implemented next week, and people's hearts fluctuated slightly. However, the overall trend was still within the range of a sideways market. Gold shop ornaments were listed at 84,000, silver at 650, and silver dollars were also fixed at 450-460. The initial dark discount was still a half corner, but later, due to the decline in the gold market, stocks, and bonds, it became sluggish again, finally about one corner and three points.</p>
<p>US Dollars: Initially strong and then weak, and even more unsustainable in the afternoon. Local inventories were sold off at high prices, and importers and yarn factories had enough inventory. As a result, it fell by eight yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars, because the Shanghai-Hong Kong route has been restored and ships will soon sail to Hong Kong, were bought by many strong parties. However, the price of the gold market's US dollars fell, and buyers also stopped when the price was high. As a result, it was still better than the previous day, and the trend was quite stable.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Continued to see small sideways markets, but retail investors were still stubbornly resisting, so that there were sometimes bright spots in the middle. However, the overall trend was unfavorable, and as a result, it fell back compared to the previous day. Type A fell by 30 yuan, Type B fell by 20 yuan, Type C fell by 45 yuan, Type D fell by 5 yuan, and Type E reached 80 yuan, which varied.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: Initially opened well yesterday, but retail investors continued to take profits, and the gold market was sluggish, and sellers took the opportunity to operate, so that they repeatedly advanced and retreated. The stocks also had different fortunes. Yarn factories were not as popular as Mayer, and Qinxing and Xinguang differed by nearly nine yuan. Jingfu was the most sluggish. As a result, except for Mayer and Xinguang, which still rose slightly compared to the previous day, the yarn factory was flat and Jingfu fell. Pharmacies and pharmaceutical factories, which were usually more deserted, continued to rise because of their cheap value. The situation in the morning was extremely chaotic, and the future became blurred.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: With a solid foundation and cheap value, they are easily favored by buyers. Popular stocks such as Ewo Yarns, Ewo Beer, and paper companies continued to rise. As a result, Ewo Yarns rose by 80 yuan, and the two small stocks of Ewo Beer and paper companies rose by more than 50 yuan. However, at high prices, there were many sellers, and the buying price was about half a percentage point lower.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: Yesterday, rice prices were very soft due to the prevailing theory of foreign rice imports, causing both japonica and indica rice to fall by 500-600 yuan. White yuan also fell by 200-300 yuan. Oil prices had stabilized after days of sharp declines. Flour was bound to increase in price. Yesterday, the Hua Feng ship sailed to Ningbo, carrying 200 bags of wheat and 100 bags of flour, and more than 60,000 bags of flour were shipped from San Francisco as relief supplies. 404 barrels of syrup were also shipped to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Corn was rarely sold, and it remained mediocre. Soybeans were rarely sold, and they turned from weak to strong, rising by 200-300 yuan. The liquor market remained stable.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Stipulates Supplementary Measures for Accepting and Exchanging Puppet Currency</h3>
<p>The Central Bank stipulated supplementary measures for the detailed rules for accepting and exchanging pseudo-Central Reserve Vouchers, which will be implemented from today. (1) The amount of acceptance and exchange is a minimum of 10 national currency and a maximum of 100,000 yuan per person per time. (2) In addition to the original exchange banks, all banks and money houses that continue to operate may be exchange agencies. Each bank may legally convert pseudo-vouchers at a ratio of 200 to 1 legal currency and deposit them into the bank. (3) All types of vouchers should be sorted out clearly and made into whole numbers for exchange or deposit. (4) Other matters shall be handled in accordance with the original exchange rules.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: The market opened slightly yesterday, and there were some transactions. Manufacturers, seeing that the market was improving, sold off one after another. Street shops also absorbed a little inventory, forming a hovering trend.</p>
<p>Coal Market: The number of incoming households is small, and people's hearts are fluctuating. It is rumored that a large amount of coal stored in Hongji Coal Mine in Vietnam will be transported to Shanghai soon, and the authorities are planning transportation methods, which has led to a further decline in the price of white coal and other goods. The arrival of firewood has led to weak sales, and the market continues to be weak.</p>
<p>Filature Silk: Due to the weekend relationship, transactions were even more sparse, and the market was selling off weakly. High-grade and ordinary five-load files of Cheli dry silk were all down about 30,000 yuan. Ordinary loose cargo was flat but showing weakness.</p>
<p>Tea: The source is not strong, but the demand is not weak. The local firms and Suzhou gangs are particularly strong, forming a market that is rising and not falling, which can be called a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Foreign Thread: After days of decline, it has turned flat yesterday, and transactions are very rare. However, the demand for white paper is still strong.</p>
<p>Southern Goods: The first batch of new San Francisco branches arrived on the Yong Sheng ship yesterday, with more than a thousand boxes. The glutinous rice branches and round and flat branches are all in full color. As soon as they are declared and transferred, new prices will be opened. Other items such as fennel, pepper, and sandalwood are also attached to the ship.</p>
