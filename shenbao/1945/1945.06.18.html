<p>西南太平洋基地十七日中央社電　十五日夕刻，敵水上艦艇之一羣，接近峇厘巴板附近，對岸上加以艦砲射擊。</p>
<h3>東亞各地最近戰况</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　東亞各地最近戰况如下：</p>
<p>馬里亞納小笠原方面：馬里亞納方面B29型機，最近逐漸增加，其數達七百五十架至九百架之多。硫黃島方面基地，現亦在進行强化中，預料今後該方面之敵空軍兵力，當更繼續增强。</p>
<p>呂宋島：呂宋島日軍部隊，現仍據守巴列特嶺及薩拉克薩克嶺要險，繼續展開激戰中。其他方面戰况，並無甚大變化，巴列特及薩拉克薩克戰綫，自三月中旬以來，迄今已激戰三月之久，日軍以壯烈之衝鋒肉博戰，阻止敵軍前進，敵曾以砲兵及空軍企圖突破兩嶺，但日軍於各陣地依然繼續猛烈反攻，士氣極為旺盛。馬尼剌東方據點日軍，仍據守各陣地予敵痛創，該方面至五月底止，判明之綜合戰果（馬尼剌巷戰及科列基多島戰綫除外），斃敵約四萬三千六百餘名，破壞各種火砲二百十三門，汽車約一千五百餘輛。</p>

<h3>東京泰晤十評美對渝政策</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　此間英文泰晤士報十六日社論，對美國前任大總統駐華特使納爾遜最近於美國雜誌上所發表之論語文批評如次：納爾遜請援助重慶，是美國之「有利投資」，此表示美國對華之企圖，及其唯圖私利報酬無所不為之美國國民性。納爾遜主張美國必須援助中國工業化，及中美盒人中國織縱業等，其次美國資本得以加入中國企業。彼又提議美投資額初為百分之六十至七十，但得於十年內逐漸收買中國人之權利。然美國之支配計劃，是否能繼續此十年期間，實為一大欵問。在此期間，美國為强化其支配力，必將發動各種新工作，如納爾遜所希求，中國成為近代之工業之鎖鑰，主要部份之操縱把持，將完全收歸其支配之下，此實明若觀火。美國所企圖中國工業化，不外能獲得為納遜所期待之利益，然不知結局對美國經濟，有給予不利之影響。蓋美國僅知由於中國工業化，可為本國戰後過剩生產品開闢一暢鎖市塲，但若中國成為工業國時，又足以驅逐美國商品之推銷，因中國產品大量之出現，顯然中國已非美國商品之市塲，而轉成對美國為一可畏之競爭者，此乃將為美國前途所足以憂慮者也。故納爾遜稱「有利投資」者，不僅美國對渝方表示其利已主義之動機，抑且為只醉心日前之利益耳。譬如「為營黃金卵，戕殺生育禽，」同為愚不可及之事，故美國所為，實近視眼之政策。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>暑期內靑年學生應做之事</h3>
<p>光陰荏苒，轉瞬又是暑假時期，按諸過去的實際情形，大部分靑年學生，在這幾十天的暑假期內，很易把寶貴時間浪費消磨了，依古人珍惜寸陰之訓，至為遺憾。何况在此非常時期，我們正愁自己的時間不敷分配，未能盡量對國家社會多做些有益工作，論理不應再有這種暑假的浪費。更就上海的特殊環境而言，足以誘惑靑年消沉腐敗和墮落的因素太多了，平時尙有許多不知自愛的靑年，誤入岐途，荒廢學業，一到正式假若，便不免如出籠之鳥，雖為父兄者，也往往約束不了，所以我們今天特別提出暑期內靑年學生應做之事，希望靑年學生諸君各知自愛。</p>
<p>在此非常時期，為未來國家社會中堅的靑年學生，不應有一日一時浪擲於嬉戲無益之事了。當然，對於種正當的娛樂，如最近一度盛行的大學生狂歡歌舞「對派」等等，更應視為靑年無恥的行為，嚴自警戒。父兄固然萬勿以一時之溺愛而放縱，同學朋友之間，亦當互相勸勉，各自振作。</p>
<p>消極的勿作無益之事，當然還不夠為新時代的靑年。必須積極地做些有益於自己學業和社會國家的事。我們認為下列數事，値得有志的靑年學生作為暑期工作的參考。</p>
<p>首先是實踐大學生到農村去的運動。儘可能的由一級　一校或數校有志同學，聯合到農村去，或者僅為考察性的短期旅行，或者作有組織有計劃的農村訪問及調查、宣傳工作。所謂考察、訪問及調查，在求深切了解當前農村裏存在些什麼問題，了解農民的疾苦和要求，以供有關當局及農業團體作為硏究對策的根據。至於所謂宣傳，除了解釋政府對於農村的法令以外，如講解時事動態，如帮助農民解決若干文字上的困難，如農村夏令衛生常識的鼓吹，以腁和令必要藥品之捐贈等，都是農村宣傳的方法。此外，聯絡農村原有學校敎師及學生，舉行懇談會，以及舉辦各村鎭暑期講習班識字班等，也是可能實現而極有意義的工作。</p>
<p>其次，如因種種原因未能到農村去的靑年學生，留在上海渡過暑期的，對於上述的暑期服務，也是可以進行的。另方面，同學之間，利用假期，組織集體自修及補習性的團體，彼此交換心得，互相切磋，以為下學學業的準備。同時，平常學校敎育必修課程積壓過重，往往對於時事問題，世界知識，缺乏基本素養，宣即利用暑期，約集同學，成立時事硏究班等，邀請熟悉時事者担任臨時講師，共同硏究，以求更正確地認訓時局眞相。</p>
<p>我們注意日本靑年學生的動態，他們在這非常時期，早巳沒有什麼假期，日夜在學習工作中鍛鍊和奮鬥，這種精神，更値得我們靑年學生急起倣效。</p>
<p>旅行通訊</p>
<h3>浙東觀感（四）——今日之寗波</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>記者逗留百官鎭兩日，至寗波之客車，於五月廿二日始通，但僅一輛（照例平日有車兩輛同行）以連日過境旅客陸續到鎭，致五十餘人立於一卡車上，其擁擠情形不啻一聽沙丁魚。</p>
<p>百官至寗波</p>
<p>離鎭之前日，逆旅中有兜售車票，其價較原價（一萬三千元）多「手續費」兩千五克百來人揚言如不由彼等代購車票，明日多車少，恐不易上車。旅客信以為眞。紛紛託彼辦理。翌日，旅客上車前，各獲得一滬杭甬鐵路局之火車票一張。迨車駛至慈谿站，軋票員請旅客換車，（時另有一非公司所屬之卡車一輛，緊隨車後）其數約四十人，僅留少數旅客於原車，旋有軋票員取出另一車票，依次軋孔，且叮嚀旅客將前有之「假票」拋棄，將正式車票上之登車站名吿知旅客，至此旅客始恍然大悟，蓋皆成為「黃魚客」矣。（俗稱私帶旅客為）「捉黃魚」）事後得悉此輩路員，與當地地痞互通聲氣，每日上午客車兩次，「捉黃魚」所得約一百二十萬元國。若是則公司損失，當屬不貲。</p>
<p>客車於兩時半開行，沿途農居類皆係兩層樓房，五尖一帶（離百官三十里處）嫩錄遍野，小村傍山而築，牧牛觸日皆是，足證所經區域之富庶。車行共五小時，經闇亭，馬諸，餘姚，蜀山，丈亭，葉家，慈谿，洪塘，莊橋，乃抵寗波。</p>
<p>訪問袁縣長</p>
<p>寗波市面繁華，為浙東最大之都市，東門大街（即中山東路）為當地之鬧區，多鞋店銀樓綢緞莊，東端盡頭之和義路則為「提莊」匯集處，銀行錢莊則多開於江東鎭一帶。</p>
<p>目前鄞縣縣長係當地紳士袁端甫氏，袁氏久任商會會長，本年四月九日經本地紳商之推蔫，始以本鄕人資格，出任本地之父母官。五月二十四日記者往訪，承接見，袁氏白髮蒼蒼，一望而知為忠厚長者，承吿鄞縣近况甚詳。</p>
<p>據袁縣長談全縣共分十區九十一鄕鎭，計一四六二保，一四一二四甲一五三，一二四戶，總人口為六二一，五九九名。前此三月間，鄞縣城區僅設有區公一所，茲為推行縣政，鞏固治安起見，已劃分為五個區公所，即一區至五區，每區分三鎭，每鎭所屬之保數不同，最多者為東湖鎭，計有七十五保，最少者為北郊鎭，僅十四保，次為南郊鎭，亦僅二十餘保。至城區全體十五鎭，其保數為五百三十二保，五一四〇甲，五四·三三三戶，人口二二八·三一六名。至六區至十區為鄕區，計七十六鄕鎭，九〇三保，八，九八四甲，九八，七九一戶，人口計三九三，二八三名。</p>
<p>民食與糧產</p>
<p>記者抵達寗波之時，未價飛漲，民食恐慌無異滬市。據袁氏吿記者，前此糧食公會辦事不力，且本縣有力米行，多未參加，茲皆邀請參加，共謀民食之解決，並成立糧食管理委員會，由該會負責配給公務員及軍警之食米，前者價格為每石五千元，後者為每石三千元。</p>
<p>按過去鄞縣每年所產之米，僅可供當地民食個個月，茲為推行增產食米起見，由縣府勸導四鄕農民，以蓆草地及　稻田，改種粳稻，將來情形，可望改善。</p>
<p>鄞縣事變前原有農田六十萬畝，現僅有四十餘萬畝，而能徵得田賦者。祗念餘萬畝耳。其田賦之收入，三十三年度業已結束，計上下兩期，共計徵得一千〇九十五萬六千二百四十元，其賦率為每畝六十元，其支配方法，依省府之規定，提出二成為「征收公費」外，餘數省四縣六，計應繳解省府者約在三百五十萬〇六千元之譜。</p>
<p>重組自警團</p>
<p>寗波治安，迄今未能確立，搶案時有，去冬路刦之風大盛。縣府為使人民協助軍警維持地方治安起見，將停頓已久之自警團，重新恢復，加强組織，其辦法以靑年團為主幹，領導推及保甲人員，巳於五月二十日開始恢復工作，六月一日起執行任務。混亂已久之鄞縣治安，今後或可漸趨穩定。</p>
<p>金融業現况</p>
<p>記者留鄞期內。曾訪當地金融界寗波為金華蘭谿等土產貨物運滬銷售之中繼地，當時餘姚三北之棉花·葉材·草席·亦為出口貨之大宗。現因棉花已受統制，其他如蓆有時令關係，藥材則滬地銷路停滯，致出口額銳減。</p>
<p>寗波對外貿易最三三蹙時，當時金融界之氣象頗現蓬勃，計有錢莊八十餘家，銀行十數家，以中·交·農四行居領袖地位。</p>
<p>事變後銀錢業幾全數停閉，初期僅有形同小攤之小錢莊數家出現，業務始終未上軌道，直至前年（三十二年）七月，中央儲備銀行金融檢查處成立，又於去年四月開始檢定各行莊之資本，並頒發營業執照，當地銀錢業之業務，始步入正軌。</p>
<p>目前寗波之銀行，有中央儲備正金銀行與浙江省銀行，此三類行之業務，除中儲立於領導地位外，正金則以盟邦軍部之收付為大宗，浙江則為代理省縣金庫之銀行。</p>
<p>錢業最近計有二十九家，以德豐為巨擘（按係李祖萊氏所手創），次推彚豐·銘記·志鴻·建華等數家，各錢莊之資本，率皆在一千萬以上。</p>
<p>此等錢莊之業務，以信用透支貼票為主，以五月廿六日為例，透支朋息為一角二分，至貼現則為每十萬元十日一期，利息約四千五百元。</p>
<p>各錢莊之主顧，各有不同，如德豐以紙烟業與雜貨業為主要主顧，建華則以銀樓業為主要對象，僅銘記及志鴻兩家範圍較廣。又銀行放款數額甚小，以二十萬為限。</p>
<p>敎育界待遇</p>
<p>鄞縣全縣公立小學計三十餘所，私立者二十所，省立女中，省立師範三校，私立者計有求實中學，集思中學，育才中學，器貞中學；四校學生以器貞最多，計九百人，師範最少，僅二十餘人。</p>
<p>公私立學校敎員待遇，相差甚大，公立學校，敎員高中每小時八十元，初中六十元，此外僅每學期有學生所供之「敬師米」一石五斗，前此本尙有公家這配給米，每月兩斗，旋減至一斗，最近由五月份起，業已本根取消。</p>
<p>私立中學之敎員待遇，以「求實」為最優。按該校之規定，每一學現每學期之學米為七斗餘，而該校有生敎員九人，學生數有兩百十五人，如是敎員每人除應有之修束外，平均每學期每人可得學米十七八石。</p>
<p>次為私立器貞，敎員修束，按米計算，即每小時計食米一升許，以一敎員平均敎課四十小時計，每月可得米約五斗，與公立學校敎員菲薄待遇相較，誠不可以道里計矣。</p>
<p>公立學校敎員生活困苦。但校長則多例外，若干校長生財有道，如預收學費，徵留額費，虛報人數及級數，甚至拆賣校產，中飽私囊，此種事件，層出不窮，最近連中山公園後身具有歷史上價値之薛樓（按係淸時曾任寗波道及駐英大臣薛福成氏之藏書樓）亦為人以廉價拆賣。</p>
<p>合作事業</p>
<p>鄞縣現有合作社二，一為「中國合作社鄞縣支社，」一為「中國合作社寗波水產合作社，」此兩合作社乃平行機關。前者於卅年十月開始籌備，當時之名稱為「鄞縣第十區農村產銷供運合作社，」翌年一月擴充範圍，易名為「寗波合作社」，開始實行對社員之日用品之配合，以肥皂·洋燭·菜油·豆·鹽·為大宗，同年六月十日率令改用今名。該社現有社員二九，五八八戶，出資口數（即股數）計二一，一四四名。資金總額二，二二二，八〇〇元。歷年除辦配給物。又於卅二年成立山產部於鄞江橋，販賣茶葉，創模範農塲，廣事宣傳，改良農產。創辦農事訓練班，培植農業人才。過去該社業務頗為活躍，去年十月因退還非農業社員股（該社社員以商人為多，農民次之，）政造成資金缺乏之現象，兼以配給物來源稀少，致吿中斷，而社務亦呈停頓狀態，最近則僅以無事可為，將資金全部及借入金全數，舉辦一萬元至五萬元之小額農貸耳。至客歲之農貸限額，則為一千元至五千元，春耕期（三月）內總計借出兩百三十萬元。</p>
<p>浙東之漁業</p>
<p>水產合作社，成立於卅年十一月，原名為「有限責任寗波水產合作社，」現該社於江厦街設有魚市塲，社內海產部之經紀人計卅四人，其所出之資本約五百萬至一千萬元，至河產部則僅十餘人，資本數十萬至百萬元。</p>
<p>本年一月曾有人在寗波組織「浙東魚市塲，」壟斷漁業，致該社社務大受影響，幾至停頓，三月間乃由中央明令取締。水產合作社，近亦在極積整頓中。</p>
<p>浙東每年漁汎期為三·四·五·八·數月間，寗波屬之漁民泰半住於梅越，陶公山，殷家灣等處，以縣別論，漁民人數以「定海」為首。約四萬人，台屬則以「溫鎭」最多，約一萬人。溫屬則推「玉環」，計兩萬四千餘人。浙省漁民之總數十五萬人。</p>
<p>捕魚塲則為沈家門，象山港，岱山，石浦等處，致漁民所用之船隻，浙省總數約兩萬七千艘（外海用者計兩萬五千艘餘為內河者），其船隻大都為漁民自有，亦有事前向船行租峹者。又漁民資金困乏時，以往皆由經紀人借給，現該社為謀漁民福利，除設有漁民福利小學及漁民施診所（寗波大來街）外，並辦理貸款，　旦成為該社目前主要業務之一矣。</p>

<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　據路透社訊：里奧波國王重返比利時之決定，倫敦權威界認此為比國內之嚴重事項，外交界及政界當局對此事亦頗感不安。此次比國王里澳波之返國，將造成整個比利時統一之局面突趨分裂，蓋比王返國即可明證將確立君主政體，則數月來安靜之比國民衆，將激起彼等之熱烈情感。</p>
<h3>日本靑年充分發揮作戰力量</h3>
<p>冲繩島方面，日美兩軍的攻防戰，業已進入重大階段。敵美憑恃其龐大數量的物力，陸續接濟冲繩前綫的美軍，敵美的兇鋒一再受挫。最近，日本名作家火野革平，為歡送特攻隊出發實行總攻擊，前往特攻隊的基地，並與朝日新聞社特派記者齋藤信也報道班員對談，茲將二氏的談話記錄於後。</p>
<p>特攻隊員性情堅决</p>
<p>火野　是然常常用到「靑年人」，「靑年力」一業話，但在巡歷各體基地以後，更深深感到靑年眞正的堅强。</p>
<p>這次，為了參觀總攻擊發動時的情况，我訪問了有關的基地，看到的特攻隊員，都只有十八九歲，雖然在隊長或幹部隊中，也有學生出身的二十五歲至二十七·八歲的人，可是他們的心情，也和一般少年隊員沒有兩樣。而且，所謂「靑年」，其涵義並不是專指年紀輕，而有「日本的靑年」或「思想堅決」的意義，可不是麼？</p>
<p>齋藤　我也這樣想。眼看前仆後繼的特攻勇士源源出擊，不由人不深深感到這個戰爭是必定勝利的。我在敵軍登陸冲繩以前，就從軍該地，其間曾巡禮各基地，以我所見的特攻隊為主體，士氣的旺盛，及出發時的恬淡寗靜，眞叫人看了感動不巳，無法形容。他們的心理，正如開始百米賽跑一般，欣然向着目標前進。</p>
<p>火野　這種心情，諒必特攻隊員本人也不自覺吧。他們即使知道，其深刻神秘，也是無從表現出來的。這不是奇妙的謎嗎？這想必也就是日本人的優點所在。</p>
<p>當我碰到早稻田大學出　的某少射時，眞所謂他鄕逢故知，非常欣喜。他那滿面春風的笑顏，眞使我有點恍恍然。當他把錢包交給我，要我代他獻捐時，他的話更叫我感動。他說：「冥土旣用不着錢，三途用（即所謂陰陽河）的擺渡錢，也不通用問的鈔票，我將這些錢帶了去，只徒然使日本貧乏，所以對不起你，代我捐給國家罷。」這樣的心意，在我們旁人還有付麼可說的！</p>
<p>心無人念唯知勝利</p>
<p>齋藤　總之，一心無他念。唯的心無他念，唯知爭取勝利罷了。</p>
<p>火野　基地上，特攻隊員與父母屬吿別時，沒有什麼特別悲壯的印象給人。家族方面，旣庶特別嚴肅的表情，隊員們也是笑着吵着，直到出發的時候，一貫保持這樣的意境。</p>
<p>不過，問題純在飛機。在前綫基地上，飛機最要緊。受到敵機轟炸時，第一就是保全地上的飛機，務必不使它們受損。這一點，做得着實澈底。巡視基地後，愉快的是：飛機的損傷意外稀少，毫不影響出擊。從全體的作戰上觀，決無障礙。這使人感到「基地健在」的可靠可恃。深信祗要將後方精力結晶而成的飛機。一架一架送去，在這大決戰中，必定可操勝算。</p>
<p>齋藤　基地司令也說，現在的一架更勝將來的十架。我想，使特攻隊失望是不應該的。記得某基地有一天受到敵機轟炸時，某特攻隊員的坐機不幸損壞，他因如此將難參加出擊，大為懊喪，直到獲得一架預備的飛機，方破顏而笑。</p>
<p>努力飛機生產</p>
<p>火野　祗要有飛機，就能勝利。這是後方人充分知道的。不過，我想，關於飛機消耗的見解，現在不應一新面目嗎？例如「一機一艦」，炸沉十艦就需飛機十架，况且同時還得加上其間別項消耗。</p>
<p>齋藤　這大決戰將以航空戰而結束，此可謂結論吧。因此，必須不顧任保犧牲，忠實做到「明天十架不如今日一架」。但望後方指導者與生產戰綫幹部加倍努力！</p>
<p>（按）火野華平氏現任陸軍報道班員西部軍囑託，齋藤報道班員則在敵美登陸冲繩以前，隨軍駐在該地，最近始負新的任務，歸返這個基地。（譯自朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>上週金融市況　仍動盪不定　米粉雜糧價見回跌</h3>
<p>本市金融與工商各業市况，最近一週仍在暴風驟雨中，動盪不定。惟因時屆端節，工商各業辦理往來結賬，銀錢業亦在緊縮頭寸，銀根時緊時鬆，市况演變稍緩，除給赤紋銀公債及敵性貨幣暗漲甚劇外，華股則反見回降，尤其中小型股跌風甚厲，美亞。永安及紗廠三熱股，先漲後回。週初開市先漲後普遍回小，惟三熱反漲，一般多頭公司極力拉抬吸收。週二盤旋堅定，週三繼續回低，散戶恐慌，加以節期前一日銀根吃緊，紛紛出龍，貶價傾吐，大有不可過止之勢。週三仍無神氣，人心浮動，賣風仍熾，上午跌勢雖繼續演進，但下午復起漲風。週四端節休市。週六開市尚佳，股市有上升之勢，不料中途又受某種流言籠罩，且因銀錢業縮短營業時間，銀根復緊，多頭傾拋，實風突起，三熱門及中小型股一致直綫下降，大有江河日下之勢，人心益趨萎疲。蓋多頭傾吐股票後，將資金移轉購買　赤，形成金漲股跌現象。週六半日市面，盤旋堅挺，散戶逢低吸收，多頭把持不願低價出　，故至收盛反見回升。至於工商各業方面，則以金便與米價狂漲，刺激各種主要及次要商品，一致奔對，各公司商號門市商品售價，每日無不改標提高價格中。一般薪水階級平民，莫不苦連天。米價一週內漲起五六十萬元之鉅，幸經政府當局採取抑平米價疏通來源之緊急措置，停止收買軍米，撤消米糧移動限制，仍由商民自由採運，民食恐慌頓時戢止，週五即見止漲回落，週六頭號杜白米即由百萬元最高峯低落至八十六關左右。生油豆汕每擔跌進七十大關，麵粉頭號白每袋跌爲十八大關，其他雜糧亦見回低。一般市民希府政經濟當局，在此安定民生採取緊急措置十七，密切監視轉資商人，聯絡金融機關，或迷上，借款暗中收囤主要食用商品，及取締暗抬市價，務使物價不在有暴漲之現象。</p>

<h3>學校應否實行　三學期制度</h3>
<p>— 人敏</p>
<p>課程與敎材　各級學校學生應修課程及教材，原有規定，是適合於兩學期制的，今設易爲三學期制，則每學期上課時間縮短，原有課程是否適合？原有的教材，學生能否修畢？尚然，救師可以教得快，但依學生學習能力和心裡來講，這是不適宜的。因　就簡吧，學生程度是否有降低之處呢？</p>
<p>學費的問題　行三學期制，做家長的一年要爲子女多付一期學費，這，在此時此敵，我想對多數家長將是一個難題，雖然，子女能早一二年畢業，能早踏進社會服務，都他們分擔一肩重擔，他們未嘗不希望，但是目前的困難－－多付學費出去，究竟是難於打破的；如說以每期學費酌予見底，固無不可，然亦應定一標準，以不影響教師收入爲原則。</p>
<p>統一的實施　假使制可以實行，我想這也該是上海教育界的一個全盤辦法，已行政力量推動，使各校一致行此制度，否則，有行二學期制的，有行三學期制的，對於程度的銜接，學生的升學，敎員的授課等等，均將發生問題，勢必形成雜亂的現象。</p>
<p>如今距離暑假已近，爲適應時代和環境，三學期制應否實行？教育當局似宜採納各方意見，縝密考慮，早作決定才好。</p>

<p>美國之建國思想，當然在自山平等獨立，美國在　屬英國殖民地時代，爲英本國壓迫榨取，受盡苛歛銖求，對英本國，痛恨切骨，正謀等待時機起而反抗，適値法國革命爆發，法國得以象徵自由平等博愛之旗幟，建立革命政府，此法國革命使在美洲之英國人受深切刺激，遂在華盛頓領導下執戈對抗英本國，終於達到濁立目的。因此美國之建國思想在自由平等獨立，其憲法亦以此三點爲骨幹，在美國，禁止以憲法造成公侯伯子男等貴族，此亦其於此種建國思想。</p>
<p>建國思想自相矛盾</p>
<p>然而此項思想至今早已自相發生矛盾，何以言之？蓋美國之立塲，猶如反抗店主之夥計，以店主之土地與房屋强搶橫奪，歸爲己有，但亦有其强搶　奪之理由，店主當亦理屈，英國已後悔不及矣。被夥計叛背店主獨立後，即稱主人之老店，一切古舊習慣，家風趣味，愛好，均已落伍悉予廢止。</p>
<p>美國成暴發戶矣。大凡商人一旦成暴發戶後·必先顯出富商之風絡，飲食·穿着·裝飾·以至居室，無不極盡奢華，並於飽暖之餘，自命風雅，搜集書畫骨董，再進一步略化資金，辦理慈警事業，釣名沽譽，收獲得對章與爵位。美國今日已有上述傾向，一反其建國思想·　　勳章，此次又效學英國製造　位。</p>
<p>英美思想不能合一</p>
<p>美國之根本思想，在於從英國桎　中脫出，　求自由平等獨立，故其教育方針亦着重於此。關於美國歷史之書籍，以及小學校之教科書，以美國之獨立戰爭跨示爲人類着想之最正當行爲，於此亦可見英美人始終不能合一的原因。美國奉華盛頓爲神，三歲兒童亦莫不聞其名而肅然起敬，誰　　美國之加拿大，兒童中不知華盛頓之名者占多數，加拿大小學校使用之歷史教科書，對於美國獨立戰爭一節叙述極爲簡單，並責難華盛頓叛背英本國，英美人之不能融治，理由甚屬明顯。</p>
<p>美國自由平等獨立之思想，使其內政與外交採取如何方向，吾人可先從國內政治觀察，彼等建國思想以民主主義爲標榜，政治思想亦由此而生，各項政治機構莫不以此根據，凡爲施策悉循此主義而進，國民自行組織政治機構，國民代表以運營國政，除採用民主政體外，與他國並無大差別，但美國猶如世界上民主主義之本家，即在雅爾達會談時，與歐洲各小國互相約定採用民主主義，以防止共產勢力蔓延。又到重慶亦　恿民主主義，以防止重慶國粹化之傾向。</p>
<p>民主主義與物質生活</p>
<p>在美國有一特徵，即美國指導國民時，以民主主表與美國式生活混爲一談，被等以爲美國人之生活最合理想，任何一家庭齊備汽車與電氣冰箱，無諭何人均可自由議論，生活自由，可享受人生眞正的樂趣，然此爲非常錯誤之見解，吾人略加透切考慮，不能認爲此因民主主義始有物質生活，美國生活所感充裕者，唯爲有廣大沃野而已。歐洲各國中頗多並無殖民地之國家，即使採用民主主義，亦不能如芙國人之盡成富家，然美國對國民如此教訓，此次被等告國民稱：因德國日本威脅美國民主主義，故必須擊滅之，並說明美國原爲求自由平等而造成獨立戰爭，脫離英國確立美國式生活，是以對此威脅不得不起而防禦，並稱更使美國式生活擴展至中國·南洋，俾改善該地人民生活，此誠欺人之談也。美國在歐洲大陸作戰，固爲受人威脅乎！又大東亞戰爭始終在大東亞地域作戰，目前且戰於日本領土之一部份，日本固未曾威脅美國民主主義，美國威脅日本生存則有之，美國之擴展民主主義成爲干涉他國內政，成脅他國生存，完全與民主主義本質背道而馳。</p>
<p>門羅主義的變質</p>
<p>再言美國建國思想，在對外政治上產生如何之主義思想？其一爲門羅主義，共二爲對中國之門戶開放主義，其三爲對滿洲國之不承認主義。第一門羅主義，爲到於歐洲之政策主張，美國事由美國人自由處理，歐洲不必加以干涉，而美國亦不干涉歐洲問題，此爲門羅大總統之宣言。此種主義之根本思想，在封鎖歐洲各國對美洲大陸之發言權，亦可說美洲完全脫離歐洲而告獨立，實則此爲不願歐洲干涉美國一國自由之政策。惟第一次歐戰　，美國出兵，門羅主義自行破壞後，芙國參院反對成爾遜總統之國際聯盟，再回復到以前之門羅主義，直至第二次大戰發生前，始終　守此種主義。但第二次大戰爆發後，因美國之租軍法案不能與歐洲問題脫盡關係，旋以大東亞戰爭機會，直接介入歐洲戰爭，目前美國對任何歐洲各問題事事置　，甚至召開聯合國會議，造成世界機構，美國門羅主義之半面，嚴然主張歐洲諸國切勿干沙美洲問題，另一面完全放棄」美國不干沙歐洲問題」之態度，自全體美國人思想的分野而觀察，並非絕無墨守純然門羅主義者，此即被稱爲孤立派者是也。孤立派目前表面上銷聲匿跡，但純粹之門羅主義思想，至今殘留於國民腦海中，假若美國一旦衰弱貧窮，此種純梓門羅主義有再見抬頭之可能。</p>
<p>對華門戶開放主義</p>
<p>歐洲戰爭告一段落後則如何？美國對歐洲　題之關心當趨淡薄，因此產生純粹門羅主義復活之客觀情勢，然美國之指導者已在歐洲付出重大犧牲，完全改變以往方式，並不希望回復至純粹之門　主義，彼等欲封門羅主義加以修正。自去年以來曾有各色國際會議於美國舉行，例如國際金融會議，鄧巴頓奧克斯安全保障會議，舊金山會歲專，欲使美國人同意於修正門羅主義。其次「門戶開放主義」，爲富日爲俄爭後，　　　中國耍求租借地等機益，意欲分割中國時由美國務　約瀚希爾提們者，彼反對列强向中國苛求，主張中國應開放門戶，使各國有均等機會，日中國爲次殖民地，抑制他國野心，同時希時美國自身亦獲一份權利，彼將美國建國思想「平等原則」歪曲使用，此門戶開放政策，即形成美國對亞細亞政策之基礎，凡企圖在亞洲抬頭之國家，必將與此政策衝突，迨至簽訂九國公約，更促此項政策成爲條約化，使各國與美國之主義趨於一致，後中國獨立日主氣氛濃厚，以及滿洲事變後日木勢力抬　，使美國政策發生破綻，該時在東亞方面日美兩國對外交政策，發生對立。</p>
<p>對滿不承認主義</p>
<p>第三爲「滿洲國不承認主義」，此主義亦可謂爲「門戶開放主義」之發展，據彼等言，變更領士應尊重人民自由意思，用武力變更領土決不承認，並說明此係根據「自由原則」。然所謂「門戶開放主義」，「滿洲國不承認主義」，莫不與美國本身之主義自相矛盾抵觸。第一點理由，美國爲何在東亞不適用「門羅主義」。如果在歐洲維持「門羅主義」，則對東亞亦應採取「門羅主義」，美國不千涉東亞，東亞亦不干涉美國，如此始合乎「平等原則」。第二美國要求東亞，尤其是中國開放門戶，而爲何對東亞人嚴厲限制進入美國國境，對東亞人加諸人道上絕不容許之不平等待進，如依照建國思想之「平等」原則，美國國內壓迫黑人作如何解釋？對東亞人之不平等待過，又作如何解釋？</p>
<p>再淪各國爲殖民地</p>
<p>美國求自由平等獨立，世界各國民族亦同樣命求自由平等獨立，尤以在過去歷一世紀以上　屬他國殖民地之南洋各地，此次能得獨立機會，以及享有自由與平等之機會，然美國於舊金山會議中，主張對此等地域剝削其獨立，再度渝爲殖民地，實施共同管理。</p>
<p>總之，美國之主義與主張，無不與本身主義　　　　，然相信此種主義主張，終不能爲世界人類容納，必將發生破定，爲人類之進步，亦將促其支　　裂也。</p>

        <h1>1945.06.18</h1>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Raids Okinawa Airfield, Heavily Bombs Nearby Fleet, Matsuwa Island and Balikpapan Shelled</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 17th, Central News Agency: On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese air force launched a sudden attack on the airfield on Okinawa Island, causing several major fires. Enemy aircraft also raided the island chain on the same day, numbering around 280, of which over a hundred attacked Tanegashima.</p>
<p>Northern Base, 17th, Central News Agency: At approximately 7:00 PM on the 11th, taking advantage of the heavy fog, enemy warships, mainly destroyers, approached Matsuwa Island and subjected it to naval bombardment, before retreating southeast. The following day (12th) at dusk, a cruiser and two destroyers reappeared in the vicinity, approaching the island from the northeast. From 6:44 PM for about twenty minutes, they used flares and shelled the island from a distance of 6,000 to 7,000 meters, before fleeing south. Japanese damage was minor.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 17th, Central News Agency: On the evening of the 15th, a group of enemy surface warships approached the vicinity of Balikpapan and subjected the coast to naval bombardment.</p>
<h3>Recent War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th, Central News Agency: The recent war situation in various parts of East Asia is as follows:</p>
<p>Mariana and Ogasawara Islands: The number of B-29 type aircraft in the Mariana Islands has been gradually increasing recently, reaching as many as 750 to 900. The base on Iwo Jima is also currently being strengthened, and it is expected that the enemy air force strength in that area will continue to increase in the future.</p>
<p>Luzon Island: Japanese troops on Luzon Island are still holding onto the strategically important Baret Ridge and Salacsac Ridge, continuing to engage in fierce fighting. There have been no major changes in the war situation in other areas. The Baret and Salacsac fronts have been fiercely contested for three months since mid-March. The Japanese army is using heroic charges and close combat to stop the enemy advance. The enemy has attempted to break through the two ridges with artillery and air force, but the Japanese army continues to launch fierce counterattacks on all positions, with extremely high morale. Japanese forces at the eastern strongholds of Manila are still holding their positions and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The combined results of the fighting in that area (excluding the street fighting in Manila and the Corregidor Island front) up to the end of May, confirm approximately 43,600 enemy killed, 213 artillery pieces destroyed, and approximately 1,500 vehicles destroyed.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific: On the island of Tarakan, Borneo, it has been a month and a half since the enemy landed. Both sides are engaged in fierce fighting day and night. On the 15th, the enemy's front line was forced to retreat somewhat. Up to recently, the results of the fighting in that area have been 2,000 enemy killed or wounded. To reverse the tide, the enemy launched an attack on the vicinity of Brunei Bay on the northwest coast of Borneo with more than 50 ships at noon on the 7th. At approximately 12:30 PM on the 8th, they began landing on nearby small islands. The enemy forces landing this time are the 9th Australian Division. Japanese forces in that area are currently fighting fiercely to intercept them. Furthermore, the air raids around Balikpapan are intensifying daily. On the 15th, approximately twenty enemy ships appeared.</p>
<p>Burma: At the time of the rainy season, the enemy's offensive is still fierce, with a total force of eleven to thirteen divisions. In the area southeast of Mandalay, in the vicinity of Loi-Lem Range, Japanese troops are intercepting the enemy, who has been attempting to invade the Japanese positions northeast of that area since the end of May, and also attempting to cut off the highway connecting Toungoo directly to Thailand. The Japanese army fought bravely and foiled their attempt. There has been little change in the area of the mouth of the Sittang River recently.</p>
<p>New Guinea: On the 5th, Japanese troops in the Uto northern coastal area attacked enemy troops near the Mafi airfield, causing great confusion to the enemy.</p>
<p>Indian Ocean: On the 13th, a small Japanese warship engaged an enemy destroyer near Sabang.</p>
<h3>Tarakan Residents Cooperate with Japanese Forces</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 17th, Central News Agency: Mr. Ishibashi Yoshito of the film distribution company, who departed from Tarakan Island before the enemy American forces landed and crossed eastern Borneo, recently arrived locally and spoke of the high morale of the Japanese soldiers in Tarakan, the enthusiastic spirit of the overseas residents, and the cooperation of the East Indian Indonesians as follows:</p>
<p>The enemy began indiscriminately bombing Tarakan in March, and in April, they targeted Japanese coastal defense lines in an attempt to land. At this time, the Japanese garrison had prepared a defense line as solid as iron. Japanese overseas residents formed a volunteer corps, and worked together with the soldiers to conduct assault training, strengthen fortifications, and repair airfields. The soldiers all held a firm belief in victory and a fervent fighting spirit to annihilate the enemy. This spirit of certain victory reflected the national consciousness of the indigenous youth, who recognized the enemy's subversive activities against Japan and shouted "We will defend our homeland together with Japan!" After the implementation of the volunteer soldier system, they enthusiastically joined. Furthermore, the general indigenous residents are also no less committed than the volunteers, continuing to struggle in constructing fortifications, repairing airfields, digging air-raid shelters, and increasing food production. During my crossing of the island of Borneo, I visited the Dayak tribal villages. The Dayak people are no less committed than the residents of Tarakan, and are all cooperating with the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>American Submarine Sinks Soviet Ship</h3>
<p>Sapporo, 17th, Central News Agency: The Soviet ship "Taras Barldo" sank on the 12th at dawn, while sailing west through the Soya Strait, after being torpedoed by an American or Chinese submarine. Ninety-nine passengers boarded five lifeboats. Four of the drifting boats were discovered and rescued by nearby Japanese patrol boats on the 14th and 15th, and are currently receiving preferential protection from the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Toshio Hirashima Appointed Vice President of South Manchuria Railway</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th, Central News Agency: Following the appointment of Mr. Motoki Yamazaki as President of South Manchuria Railway, the cabinet appointed Toshio Hirashima, director of Manchuria Electric Power Company, as Vice President on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Three-Power Conference Location Will Be Potsdam</h3>
<p>London, 17th, Central News Agency: According to the London Times diplomatic correspondent today, Potsdam, the former palace of the German emperors, will be the site of the British, American, and Soviet leaders' meeting. Potsdam is only fifteen kilometers from Berlin.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki and Entourage Visit Atsuta Shrine</h3>
<p>Nagoya, 17th, Central News Agency: Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki and his entourage visited Atsuta Shrine at 3:30 PM on the 16th. They also visited a certain Aichi clock factory and a discussion meeting held by the Governor-General. At the meeting, the Prime Minister delivered a speech, encouraging them to take on the mission of "Production is Defense" under the increasingly fierce air raids in the future, and to further enhance their fighting spirit, etc.</p>
<h3>London Times Comments on US Policy Towards Chongqing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th, Central News Agency: The English-language Times newspaper in this area criticized the arguments recently published in an American magazine by Nelson, the former Special Envoy to China of the former US President, in its editorial on the 16th as follows: Nelson's request for aid to Chongqing is a "profitable investment" for the United States. This indicates America's intentions toward China and its American national character of seeking nothing but private gain and reward. Nelson argues that the United States must assist in the industrialization of China and in Sino-American joint ventures in the Chinese textile industry, etc., so that American capital can join Chinese enterprises. He also proposed that the US investment amount should initially be 60% to 70%, but that the right to gradually buy out the Chinese within ten years. However, whether America's plan for domination can continue for this ten-year period is a major question. During this period, the United States will inevitably launch various new efforts to strengthen its dominance. As Nelson desires, if China becomes the key to modern industry, the manipulation and control of the main parts will be completely taken under its control. This is as clear as looking at a fire. The industrialization of China that the United States is attempting is nothing more than to obtain the benefits that Nelson expects, but it is unknown whether the outcome will have an adverse impact on the American economy. Because the United States only knows that due to the industrialization of China, a smooth market can be opened up for its own post-war surplus production, but if China becomes an industrial country, it will also be enough to drive out the sales of American goods. Because of the large-scale appearance of Chinese products, China is obviously no longer a market for American goods, but instead becomes a formidable competitor to the United States. This is something that should be worried about for the future of the United States. Therefore, Nelson's so-called "profitable investment" not only shows the selfish motives of the United States towards Chongqing, but also is only obsessed with immediate interests. For example, "To kill the hen that lays the golden eggs," is an equally foolish thing, so what the United States is doing is a shortsighted policy.</p>

<h3>What Young Students Should Do During the Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>Time flies, and the summer vacation is here again in an instant. According to past experiences, most young students easily waste and squander their precious time during these few dozens of days of summer vacation, which is extremely regrettable, in accordance with the ancient people's teaching of cherishing every inch of time. Moreover, in this extraordinary period, we are worried that our own time is not enough to allocate, and we have not been able to do as much beneficial work for the country and society as possible. In principle, there should be no more of this kind of waste of summer vacation. Furthermore, in terms of Shanghai's special environment, there are too many factors that can tempt young people into decadence, corruption, and depravity. Usually, there are still many young people who do not cherish themselves, go astray, and neglect their studies. Once the formal vacation arrives, they inevitably act like birds out of a cage. Even fathers and elder brothers are often unable to restrain them. Therefore, we are specifically raising the issue of what young students should do during the summer vacation today, hoping that all young students will know how to cherish themselves.</p>
<p>In this extraordinary period, young students, who are the mainstay of the future country and society, should not waste a single day or moment on playful and useless things. Of course, any kind of proper entertainment is acceptable, but things like the recent popular college student carnival dance "対派" should be regarded as shameless behavior of young people, and they should strictly guard against them. Fathers and elder brothers must not indulge them out of momentary doting, and classmates and friends should also encourage each other and cheer up.</p>
<p>Passively refraining from doing useless things is certainly not enough for the young people of the new era. They must actively do things that are beneficial to their studies and to the society and the country. We believe that the following matters are worth considering by ambitious young students as a reference for their summer work.</p>
<p>First is the practice of the university students going to the countryside movement. As much as possible, students from one grade, one school, or several schools, should jointly go to the countryside, either just for a short fact-finding trip, or for organized and planned rural visits and investigation and propaganda work. The so-called fact-finding, visits and investigation, are to seek a deep understanding of what problems exist in the current countryside, and to understand the hardships and demands of the farmers, so as to provide relevant authorities and agricultural groups with a basis for studying countermeasures. As for the so-called propaganda, in addition to explaining the government's laws and regulations for the countryside, such as explaining current affairs trends, helping farmers solve some literacy difficulties, promoting common-sense summer hygiene in rural areas, and donating necessary medicines, are all methods of rural propaganda. In addition, contacting teachers and students in the original schools in the countryside to hold discussion meetings, and holding summer classes and literacy classes in various villages and towns, are also possible and meaningful work.</p>
<p>Secondly, if young students are unable to go to the countryside for various reasons and stay in Shanghai for the summer, they can also carry out the above-mentioned summer service. On the other hand, students can use the vacation to organize collective self-study and tutoring groups to exchange ideas with each other and learn from each other in preparation for the next semester's studies. At the same time, the compulsory curriculum in ordinary school education is often too heavy, and they often lack basic literacy in current affairs and world knowledge. They should immediately use the summer vacation to gather classmates, establish current affairs research classes, etc., and invite those familiar with current affairs to serve as temporary lecturers, and study together to seek a more accurate understanding of the true situation of the current situation.</p>
<p>We pay attention to the trends of Japanese young students. In this extraordinary period, they have long since had no vacation, and are training and struggling in learning and work day and night. This spirit is even more worthy of our young students to emulate quickly.</p>
<p>Travel News</p>
<h3>Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang (4) – Ningbo Today</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>The reporter stayed in Baiguan Town for two days. The bus to Ningbo only started running on May 22nd, but there was only one (usually two buses run together). Because travelers passing through had been arriving in the town continuously for days, more than fifty people were standing in one truck. The crowding was no different from a can of sardines.</p>
<p>Baiguan to Ningbo</p>
<p>The day before leaving the town, people in the inn were selling bus tickets at a price more expensive than the original price (13,000 yuan) by charging a "handling fee" of 2,500 yuan. About a hundred people claimed that if they didn't buy tickets through them, there would be fewer buses the next day and it would be difficult to get on. The travelers believed it and entrusted them to handle it. The next day, before the travelers boarded the bus, they each received a train ticket from the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau. When the bus arrived at Cixi Station, the ticket checker asked the travelers to change buses (at that time, there was another truck not affiliated with the company following closely behind). About forty people were asked to change buses, with only a few travelers remaining in the original bus. Then, the ticket checker took out another ticket, punched holes in it one by one, and told the travelers to throw away the previous "fake tickets," and informed the travelers of the name of the boarding station on the official ticket. At this point, the travelers finally realized that they had all become "yellowfish passengers" (commonly known as privately carrying passengers). Afterwards, it was learned that these railway staff colluded with local ruffians. With two buses running every morning, the income from "catching yellowfish" was about 1.2 million yuan. If this is the case, the company's losses must be considerable.</p>
<p>The bus departed at 2:30 PM. Along the way, the farmers' residences were mostly two-story buildings. In the area around Wujian (about 30 li from Baiguan), tender greenery covered the fields. Small villages were built against the mountains, and grazing cattle were visible everywhere. This proves the prosperity of the area. The journey took five hours, passing through Anting, Mazhu, Yuyao, Shushan, Zhangting, Yejią, Cixi, Hongtang, Zhuangqiao, and finally arriving at Ningbo.</p>
<p>Visiting County Magistrate Yuan</p>
<p>Ningbo's city streets are bustling and prosperous. It is the largest city in Eastern Zhejiang. Dongmen Street (i.e., Zhongshan East Road) is the local downtown area, with many shoe stores, jewelry stores, and silk shops. At the eastern end, Heyi Road is where "Tizhuang" (shipping agencies) are concentrated, while banks and money houses are mostly located in the Jiangdong Town area.</p>
<p>The current County Magistrate of Yin County is Mr. Yuan Duanfu, a local gentleman. Mr. Yuan served as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce for a long time. On April 9th of this year, he was recommended by local gentry and businessmen to serve as the local official because he was a local. The reporter visited him on May 24th and was received. Mr. Yuan had white hair and was clearly a kind and honest elder. He gave a very detailed account of the recent situation in Yin County.</p>
<p>According to County Magistrate Yuan, the entire county is divided into ten districts and ninety-one townships, totaling 1,462 bao, 14,124 jia, 153,124 households, and a total population of 621,599. Previously, in March, there was only one district office set up in the urban area of Yin County. Now, in order to promote county administration and consolidate public security, it has been divided into five district offices, namely Districts 1 to 5. Each district is divided into three towns, and the number of bao belonging to each town varies. The most is Donghu Town, with 75 bao, and the least is the Northern Suburb Town, with only 14 bao, followed by the Southern Suburb Town, with only over 20 bao. The entire urban area of fifteen towns has 532 bao, 5,140 jia, 54,333 households, and a population of 228,316. Districts 6 to 10 are rural areas, with a total of 76 townships, 903 bao, 8,984 jia, 98,791 households, and a population of 393,283.</p>
<p>People's Food and Grain Production</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived in Ningbo, rice prices were soaring, and the public was as panicked about food as in Shanghai. According to Mr. Yuan, the Grain Association had previously been ineffective, and many powerful rice shops in the county had not participated. Now, they have all been invited to participate in order to solve the problem of people's food supply, and a Grain Management Committee has been established. The committee is responsible for rationing rice to civil servants and military police, with the former paying 5,000 yuan per shi and the latter 3,000 yuan per shi.</p>
<p>In the past, the amount of rice produced in Yin County each year was only enough to feed the local population for nine months. Now, in order to promote increased rice production, the county government is encouraging farmers in the four rural areas to convert rush grass fields and lean paddy fields to grow japonica rice. The situation is expected to improve in the future.</p>
<p>Before the incident, Yin County had 600,000 mu of farmland, but now there are only over 400,000 mu. Only over 100,000 mu can be taxed. The revenue from land tax for the 33rd year (1944) has already ended. The total collected for both the upper and lower terms was 10,095,6240 yuan, and the tax rate was 60 yuan per mu. The method of distribution is in accordance with the regulations of the provincial government. Two percent is set aside as "collection expenses," and the remaining amount is divided between the province and the county at a ratio of 4:6. It is estimated that about 3,500,6000 yuan should be turned over to the provincial government.</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Self-Defense Corps</p>
<p>Public security in Ningbo has not yet been established. Robberies occur from time to time, and the trend of highway robbery was rampant last winter. In order to enable the people to assist the military and police in maintaining local security, the county government has reorganized the long-suspended Self-Defense Corps, strengthened its organization, and taken the Youth Corps as the backbone, leading and promoting personnel from the baojia system. It began its work on May 20th and will begin performing its duties on June 1st. The long-chaotic public security of Yin County may gradually become stable in the future.</p>
<p>Current Status of the Financial Industry</p>
<p>During the reporter's stay in Yin, I visited the local financial community. Ningbo is the transfer station for local products from Jinhua, Lanxi, and other places to be transported to Shanghai for sale. At that time, cotton, medicinal materials, and grass mats from Sanbei in Yuyao were also major export commodities. Now, because cotton has been controlled, other commodities such as mats are subject to seasonal factors, and sales of medicinal materials in Shanghai have stagnated, resulting in a sharp decline in export volume.</p>
<p>When Ningbo's foreign trade was at its most prosperous, the financial community was thriving, with more than 80 money shops and a dozen banks, with the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Bank of China leading the way.</p>
<p>After the incident, almost all the silver and money industries closed down. In the early days, only a few small money shops, resembling small stalls, appeared, but their business never got on track. It was not until the establishment of the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank in July of the year before last (1943), and the start of verification of the capital of various banks and money shops and the issuance of business licenses in April of last year, that the business of the local silver and money industry began to get back on track.</p>
<p>Currently, Ningbo has the Central Reserve Bank, the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank. Among these three types of banks, the Central Reserve Bank is in a leading position, the Yokohama Specie Bank mainly handles receipts and payments for Allied military units, and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank is the agent for the provincial and county treasuries.</p>
<p>Recently, there are 29 money shops, with Defeng as the giant (founded by Mr. Li Zulai), followed by Huifeng, Mingji, Zhihong, Jianhua, and other shops. The capital of each money shop is generally above 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>The business of these money shops mainly focuses on credit overdrafts and discount bills. For example, on May 26th, the interest rate on overdrafts was 1.2 fen, and the discount rate was about 4,500 yuan for every 100,000 yuan for a ten-day period.</p>
<p>Each money shop has different customers. For example, Defeng mainly serves the cigarette and grocery industries, while Jianhua mainly targets the jewelry industry. Only Mingji and Zhihong have a wider scope. The amount of bank loans is very small, limited to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Education Sector Salaries</p>
<p>There are more than 30 public primary schools and 20 private primary schools in Yin County. There are three provincial women's high schools and provincial normal schools. The private schools include Qiushi High School, Jisi High School, Yucai High School, and Qizhen High School. Qizhen High School has the most students, with 900, and the normal school has the least, with only over 20 students.</p>
<p>There is a big difference in the treatment of teachers in public and private schools. In public schools, high school teachers receive 80 yuan per hour, and junior high school teachers receive 60 yuan per hour. In addition, each semester, they only receive 1.5 dou of "teacher appreciation rice" provided by the students. Previously, the government also allocated rice, two dou per month, which was later reduced to one dou, and recently, starting in May, it has been completely cancelled.</p>
<p>Among the private high schools, the treatment of teachers at "Qiushi" is the best. According to the school's regulations, each student pays more than 7 dou of rice per semester. The school has 9 faculty members and 215 students. Thus, each teacher, in addition to the necessary expenses, can receive an average of 17 or 18 shi of rice per semester.</p>
<p>The next best is the private Qizhen High School. Teachers' salaries are calculated in terms of rice, that is, about 1 sheng of rice per hour. Assuming that a teacher teaches an average of 40 hours per month, they can receive about 5 dou of rice per month. Compared to the meager treatment of teachers in public schools, it is really incomparable.</p>
<p>The lives of teachers in public schools are difficult. However, principals are mostly exceptions. Some principals have ways to make money, such as collecting tuition in advance, collecting retention fees, falsely reporting the number of students and grade levels, and even demolishing and selling school property to enrich their own pockets. Such incidents occur frequently. Recently, even the Xue Lou (a library built by Xue Fucheng, who served as the Ningbo Taoist and British minister in the Qing Dynasty) behind Zhongshan Park, which has historical value, was demolished and sold at a low price.</p>
<p>Cooperative Enterprises</p>
<p>There are currently two cooperatives in Yin County, one is the "Yin County Branch of the China Cooperative," and the other is the "Ningbo Aquatic Products Cooperative of the China Cooperative." These two cooperatives are parallel organizations. The former began preparations in October of the 30th year (1941). At that time, its name was "Yin County Tenth District Rural Production and Marketing Cooperative." The following year, in January, it expanded its scope and changed its name to "Ningbo Cooperative." It began to coordinate the daily necessities of its members, with soap, candles, vegetable oil, beans, and salt being the main items. On June 10th of the same year, it was ordered to use its current name. The cooperative currently has 29,588 member households, with 21,144 shares (i.e., shares). The total amount of funds is 2,222,800 yuan. Over the years, in addition to handling the distribution of goods, it also established a mountain products department in Yinjianqiao in the 32nd year (1943) to sell tea, created a model farm, widely promoted and improved agricultural products, and established an agricultural training class to cultivate agricultural talent. In the past, the cooperative's business was quite active. In October of last year, due to the refund of shares to non-agricultural members (the cooperative had more merchants than farmers), it caused a shortage of funds. In addition, the sources of allocated goods were scarce, leading to a suspension, and the cooperative's affairs were also at a standstill. Recently, with nothing to do, all the funds and borrowed funds have been used to provide small agricultural loans ranging from 10,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. The loan limit for last year's agricultural loans was 1,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan. A total of 2.3 million yuan was lent out during the spring plowing season (March).</p>
<p>The Fisheries of Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>The Aquatic Products Cooperative was established in November of the 30th year (1941), originally named "Ningbo Aquatic Products Cooperative Limited." The cooperative now has a fish market in Jiangxia Street. The cooperative's marine products department has 34 brokers, with capital ranging from 5 million to 10 million yuan, while the river products department has only a dozen or so people, with capital ranging from several hundred thousand to one million yuan.</p>
<p>In January of this year, someone in Ningbo organized the "Eastern Zhejiang Fish Market" to monopolize the fishing industry, which greatly affected the cooperative's business, almost to the point of suspension. In March, the central government explicitly banned it. The Aquatic Products Cooperative is also actively reorganizing.</p>
<p>The annual fishing season in Eastern Zhejiang is in March, April, May, and August. Most of the fishermen belonging to Ningbo live in Meiyue, Taogong Mountain, Yinjiawan, and other places. By county, the number of fishermen is led by "Dinghai," with about 40,000 people. In the Taizhou area, "Wenzhen" has the most, with about 10,000 people. In the Wenzhou area, "Yuhuan" has the most, with more than 24,000 people. The total number of fishermen in Zhejiang Province is 150,000.</p>
<p>The fishing grounds are in Shenjiamen, Xiangshan Port, Daishan, Shipu, and other places. The total number of fishing vessels used by fishermen in Zhejiang Province is about 27,000 (more than 25,000 for offshore use and the rest for inland rivers). Most of the vessels are owned by the fishermen themselves, but some also rent them from shipyards in advance. When fishermen lack funds, they used to borrow from brokers. Now, in order to promote the welfare of fishermen, the cooperative has set up fishermen's welfare primary schools and fishermen's clinics (Dalaike Street, Ningbo) and provides loans, which has become one of the cooperative's main businesses.</p>
<h3>Tensions Suddenly Escalate Between France and Spain</h3>
<p>Blue Uniform Army Train Attacked</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, earlier reports stated that the French attacked a train carrying several teams of Spanish "Blue Uniform Army" from Switzerland, causing tensions to suddenly escalate between Spain and France. Detailed information about the beginning and end of the disaster has not yet been received, but according to initial reports, about 1,000 members of the French "Resistance Party" suddenly attacked a train carrying 1,000 Spanish "Blue Uniform Army" while it was stopped at the Genblen Station yesterday. It is reported that the Spanish troops were returning to their country from Switzerland after fighting with Soviet forces. The report also stated that the train was carrying many French soldiers from the former Vichy government. Twelve people died and one hundred were seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Indian Governor-General Invites Leaders to Hold Talks</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from New Delhi, Indian Governor-General Lord Wavell replied to Quaid-i-Azam Jinnah, President of the All-India Muslim League, yesterday, stating that it is not appropriate to convene talks before Indian leaders hold a meeting in Simla. Our talks can be tentatively scheduled for June 25th.</p>
<p>Bela Issues Warning to Britain</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to reports received here, Indian industrial leader Bela recently went to Britain to inspect the industrial situation for the development of Indian industry. He suddenly made a threatening speech in London, stating that if British industrialists hope to manage post-war Indian industry, India will seek industrial markets elsewhere. India must control its own created businesses and is unwilling to share this management power with other countries under any circumstances, and would rather pay any price to obtain sophisticated industrial technology. Now we have to appeal to British industry, hoping to complete the development of our India, otherwise our India will find a way out elsewhere, and at that time, both India and Britain may not benefit.</p>
<h3>Mexican Ambassador to Chongqing Takes Office</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – The first Mexican Ambassador to Chongqing, General Yescalante, is scheduled to leave for Chongqing on the 17th to take office.</p>
<h3>Leopold to Return Home, Belgian Cabinet Resigns En Masse – Britain Feels Anxious About Belgian Political Situation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from Brussels states that the Belgian cabinet resigned en masse on the 16th. Regarding this matter, the Belgian Information Bureau issued the following statement: Belgian King Leopold will soon return home. The government resigned en masse because it could not bear the political situation after the king's return. We advocate establishing a new government before the king's return. Regarding the issue of King Leopold's abdication, the Belgian royalists and socialists have opposing opinions. The former hopes for the king's return, while the socialists strongly demand the king's abdication. The current cabinet is in a dilemma, so it resigned en masse.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters: The decision of King Leopold to return to Belgium is recognized by authoritative circles in London as a serious matter in Belgium. Diplomatic and political authorities are also quite anxious about this matter. The return of King Leopold will cause the overall unity of Belgium to suddenly become divided, because the king's return will clearly prove the establishment of a monarchy, which will arouse the enthusiastic feelings of the Belgian people who have been quiet for months.</p>
<h3>Japanese Youth Fully Demonstrate Combat Power</h3>
<p>On the Okinawa Island front, the offensive and defensive battle between the Japanese and American armies has entered a critical stage. Relying on its massive material resources, the enemy America has continuously resupplied the American troops on the Okinawa front line, but the enemy America's fierce offensive has been repeatedly frustrated. Recently, the famous Japanese writer Kagehei Hino went to the base of the special attack team to welcome the special attack team's departure to carry out the general attack, and had a dialogue with the members of the Asahi Shimbun special reporter Saito Shinya reporting team. The following is a record of the conversation between the two.</p>
<p>Special Attack Team Members Determined</p>
<p>Hino: Yes, we often use the words "youth" and "youth power," but after touring various base bodies, I deeply feel the true strength of youth.</p>
<p>This time, in order to see the situation when the general attack was launched, I visited the relevant base. The special attack team members I saw were only 18 or 19 years old. Although there were also 25 to 27-8-year-olds who were students in the team leader or cadre team, their mood was no different from that of the average young team member. Moreover, the meaning of "youth" does not only refer to young age, but also has the meaning of "Japanese youth" or "determined thinking," doesn't it?</p>
<p>Saito: I think so too. Watching the special attack heroes charge forward one after another, one cannot help but deeply feel that this war will definitely be won. I joined the army in Okinawa before the enemy landed, and during that time I visited various bases. What I saw was the special attack team as the main body. The vigor of morale and the tranquility of departure were truly moving and indescribable. Their mentality is just like starting a 100-meter race, happily moving forward towards the goal.</p>
<p>Hino: This kind of mood must be unconscious even to the special attack team members themselves. Even if they know it, its profound mystery cannot be expressed. Isn't this a wonderful mystery? This must be the advantage of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>When I met a certain lieutenant from Waseda University, it was truly like meeting an old friend in a foreign land, and I was very happy. His smiling face made me feel a little dazed. When he handed me his wallet and asked me to donate it for him, his words moved me even more. He said, "Money is not needed in the underworld, and the ferry money for the Sanzu River (i.e., the Yin-Yang River) is not the same as the tickets used. If I take this money with me, it will only make Japan poorer, so I'm sorry, please donate it to the country for me." What else can we onlookers say to this kind of intention!</p>
<p>No Thoughts of People, Only Victory</p>
<p>Saito: In short, there is no other thought in mind. The only thing in mind is to strive for victory.</p>
<p>Hino: At the base, when the special attack team members said goodbye to their parents, there was no particularly tragic impression given to people. The family members did not have a particularly solemn expression, and the team members were laughing and joking, maintaining this mood until the time of departure.</p>
<p>However, the problem is purely with the aircraft. On the front-line base, the most important thing is the aircraft. When the base is bombed by enemy aircraft, the first priority is to protect the aircraft on the ground and ensure that they are not damaged. This is done very thoroughly. What is pleasing after inspecting the base is that the damage to the aircraft is unexpectedly rare and does not affect the attack at all. From the overall battle, there is no obstacle. This makes people feel the reliability of "the base is healthy." I firmly believe that as long as the aircraft, which is the crystallization of the energy of the rear, is sent one by one, we will surely be able to win this great decisive battle.</p>
<p>Saito: The base commander also said that one aircraft now is better than ten aircraft in the future. I think it is not right to disappoint the special attack team. I remember that one day when a certain base was bombed by enemy aircraft, a certain special attack team member's aircraft was unfortunately damaged. He was very frustrated because he would have difficulty participating in the attack, and he did not smile until he obtained a spare aircraft.</p>
<p>Strive for Aircraft Production</p>
<p>Hino: As long as there are aircraft, we can win. This is something that people in the rear fully know. However, I think, should the view on aircraft consumption be renewed now? For example, "one aircraft, one warship," sinking ten warships requires ten aircraft, and even more during other sorts of consumptions.</p>
<p>Saito: This great decisive battle will end with an air war, this can be said to be the conclusion. Therefore, we must faithfully do "ten aircraft tomorrow are not as good as one aircraft today" regardless of any sacrifice. I hope that the leaders in the rear and the cadres on the production front will double their efforts!</p>
<p>(Note) Hino Kahei is currently entrusted to the Western Army by the Army Reporting Team, while Saito, a member of the Reporting Team, was stationed with the army in Okinawa before the enemy America landed, and recently took on a new task and returned to this base.

<h3>This City's Banking and Money Exchange Businesses to Change Business Hours Starting Today: 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM</h3>
<p>The joint conference of banking and money exchange businesses in this city has decided that, starting from the 18th of this month (today), the business hours for all banks and money exchanges will be uniformly changed to 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The clearing time for negotiable instruments will be changed to 12:00 noon for banks, and starting at 12:00 noon for money exchanges (same on Saturdays). At the same time, detailed regulations have been separately stipulated regarding the time for presenting various negotiable instruments, as well as for returning items, misplaced items, and the time for customers to deposit instruments for collection. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Bankers' Association</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Council of Banking Businesses has revised the time for entrusted collection of various negotiable instruments by member businesses: For negotiable instruments that can be submitted for clearing by the association (i.e., clearing bank and payment instruments of banks entrusted to the association to act as clearing agents): (A) Banks entrusted to this association to act as clearing agents, member businesses with transactions with the association, before 11:00 AM.

Note: Please strictly adhere to the above-listed collection times, and no exceptions will be made for late submissions. Returned items after clearing by member businesses, and those collected on behalf of this association, should be returned to this association by 5:00 PM that afternoon. No exceptions will be made for late submissions. They should be handled directly between the returning bank and the original collecting bank, and this association will not be responsible. The time for misplaced instruments between banks and money exchanges is up to 12:00 noon. The above times have been approved and implemented by the council of the association. The handling of returned items on the Bund will still be handled according to the original method, and the time remains the same.</p>
<p>Money Reserve Treasury</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Treasury of Money Exchange Businesses has revised the methods for collecting and paying instruments by member businesses: Banks collect money exchanges', money exchanges entrust banks to collect payment instruments, time for sending to the treasury association, before 12:00 noon. Treasury association's payment dispatches are deposited in the treasury association. Remittances from the Central Reserve Bank and bank drafts sent to the treasury are all before 2:00 PM. Payment instruments of foreign banks sent to the treasury, 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM (entered into the next day's accounts). Mutual instruments between banks and money exchanges, up to 12:00 noon. Member businesses exchanging drafts with customers or mutual allocations between businesses, up to 1:00 PM. Returned items and late arrivals at the treasury association, before 5:00 PM. Note: All businesses should strictly adhere to the above-stated times. The treasury association will not make any exceptions for late submissions. Clearing staff should be punctual and adhere to the time. If there are late arrivals or absences, the treasury will impose penalties according to the regulations. For instruments deposited by customers with member businesses, subject to the restrictions of the current day's accounts, all instruments deposited by customers for collection on the same day are limited to the amount that can be received on the same day. (Generally, the standard is for member businesses in the central district to collect up to 10:30 AM. Member businesses should determine this themselves based on their location and business conditions.) Any deposits made after this time that cannot be submitted for clearing or collection will be entered into the next day's accounts. If there are any conflicts with the current temporary measures for banking and money exchange businesses during air raid alerts, these measures shall be handled in accordance with this method.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Financial Market Situation: Still Unstable; Prices of Rice Flour and Grains Show a Decline</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial and commercial market situation in this city has been unstable in the recent week amidst torrential storms. However, due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival, industrial and commercial businesses are handling current account settlements, and banking and money exchange businesses are also tightening their positions. The money supply is tight and loose at times, and the market situation is evolving slightly slower. Except for the large increase in the price of Chih-fu silver public bonds and enemy currency, Chinese stocks have shown a decline. In particular, small and medium-sized stocks have experienced a severe decline. Three hot stocks, Mei Ah, Wing On, and Cotton Mill, rose first and then declined. The market opened higher at the beginning of the week and then generally declined slightly, but the three hot stocks rose again. Many bullish companies tried their best to raise and absorb them. The market was firm on Tuesday and continued to decline on Wednesday. Retail investors panicked, and the money supply was tight the day before the festival, so they sold out one after another, dumping their holdings at low prices, with a tendency to be unstoppable. The market was still lifeless on Wednesday, and people's hearts were restless. The selling trend was still strong. Although the decline continued in the morning, there was a rebound in the afternoon. The market was closed on Thursday for the Dragon Boat Festival. The market was good when it opened on Saturday, and the stock market had an upward trend. Unexpectedly, it was shrouded in some rumors in the middle, and the money supply tightened again due to the shortening of business hours of banking and money exchange businesses. Bulls dumped their holdings, and the bearish trend suddenly rose. The three hot stocks and small and medium-sized stocks all declined in a straight line, with a tendency to be on a downward spiral, and people's hearts became more and more tired. It is because after the bulls dumped their stocks, they transferred their funds to buy Chih-fu, forming a phenomenon of rising gold and falling stocks. The half-day market on Saturday was firm, and retail investors absorbed at low prices. Bulls held on and were unwilling to sell at low prices, so the market rebounded at the close. As for the industrial and commercial sectors, the soaring prices of gold and rice stimulated various major and minor commodities to run up together. The prices of goods in the stores of various companies and businesses are revised and increased every day. Ordinary salaried people are suffering endlessly. The price of rice has risen by as much as 500,000 to 600,000 yuan in a week. Fortunately, the government authorities took emergency measures to suppress and stabilize rice prices and dredge the sources, stopped buying military rice, and lifted restrictions on the movement of rice and grains, allowing merchants and people to freely transport it. The panic of the people's food was immediately suppressed. On Friday, the rise stopped and fell back. On Saturday, the top-quality Du Bai rice fell from a peak of one million yuan to about 860,000 yuan. Soybean oil fell by 70,000 yuan per load, and the top-quality white flour fell to 180,000 yuan per bag. Other miscellaneous grains also showed a decline. The general public hopes that the government's economic authorities will take emergency measures to stabilize people's livelihoods, closely monitor speculators and merchants, and contact financial institutions to secretly hoard major food commodities with loans and crack down on secretly raising market prices, so that commodity prices will not experience a sharp increase again.</p>

<h3>Volleyball Women's Group Finale: Huayan vs. Xinben; Group A Zhongbei vs. White Team</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Volleyball League has been going on since it opened on the 26th of last month. After three weeks of competition, Group A has only two games left. Only Huayan vs. Xinben remains in the women's group. The teams in Group B are at the height of competition and the champion and places are largely decided. The order will be completed by the end of the month. Today's women's group Huayan vs. Xinben from 5:00 is the last game of the season. Three provinces have already won the title in that group, and Xinben has been slightly better than Huayan in recent games. Group A Zhongbei vs. White Team: Zhongbei's lineup is strong and unsurpassable by other teams. Yuan Bingqiu's smashing, Huang Yaoluo's defense, and Li Baozhong's spiking are unmatched by Shanghai soldiers. The White Team is not expected to win. The order today is as follows:</p>
<p>Huayan vs. Xinben (Women's Group) 5:30, Zhongbei vs. White Team (Group A) 6:30.</p>

<h3>Should Schools Implement a Three-Semester System?</h3>
<p>-- Ren Min</p>
<p>Curriculum and Teaching Materials: The existing regulations for the courses and teaching materials that students of all levels of schools should study are suitable for a two-semester system. Now, if it is easily changed to a three-semester system, the class time for each semester will be shortened. Is the original curriculum suitable? Can students complete the original teaching materials? If so, the teacher can teach quickly, but in terms of students' learning ability and psychology, this is not appropriate. As a result, should the students' level be lowered?</p>
<p>Tuition Fees: With the implementation of the three-semester system, parents will have to pay an extra semester of tuition for their children each year. At this time of war, I think this will be a problem for most parents. Although their children can graduate one or two years earlier and enter society earlier to share their burden, they have never hoped that. However, the current difficulty - paying extra tuition - is ultimately difficult to overcome; if the tuition for each semester is appropriately reduced, it is certainly possible, but a standard should also be set to not affect teachers' income as a principle.</p>
<p>Unified Implementation: If the system can be implemented, I think this should also be a comprehensive method for the Shanghai education community, promoted by administrative power so that all schools uniformly implement this system. Otherwise, some schools implement a two-semester system, and some schools implement a three-semester system. Problems will arise for the connection of levels, students' enrollment, teachers' teaching, etc., which will inevitably lead to a chaotic phenomenon.</p>
<p>Now that summer vacation is near, should the three-semester system be implemented to adapt to the times and environment? It seems that the education authorities should adopt opinions from all parties, carefully consider, and make a decision as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>American Ideological Problems</h3>
<p>— Matsudaira</p>
<p>The foundational ideology of the United States naturally lies in freedom, equality, and independence. During its time as a British colony, America was oppressed and exploited by the British mainland, subjected to harsh levies and meticulous exactions. It harbored deep resentment towards Britain and sought an opportunity to revolt. The outbreak of the French Revolution, with its symbolic banner of liberty, equality, and fraternity, profoundly stimulated the British in America. Consequently, under the leadership of Washington, they took up arms against the British mainland, ultimately achieving independence. Therefore, America's founding ideology rests on freedom, equality, and independence, with its constitution built around these three tenets. In the United States, the constitution prohibits the creation of aristocratic titles like dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons, which also reflects this foundational ideology.</p>
<p>Contradictions Within Founding Ideology</p>
<p>However, this ideology has long been fraught with internal contradictions. Why do I say this? Because America's position is akin to a shop assistant rebelling against the shop owner, forcibly seizing the owner's land and property and claiming it as their own. While there may have been reasons for this forceful seizure, the shop owner was ultimately left with no recourse. Britain now regrets its actions. After the shop assistant betrayed the shop owner and declared independence, they immediately denounced the master's old shop, discarding all the old habits, family traditions, tastes, and preferences as outdated.</p>
<p>America has become a nouveau riche. As soon as a merchant becomes wealthy, they invariably display the airs of a wealthy businessman. Their food, clothing, decorations, and even their residences become exceedingly extravagant. And after satisfying their basic needs, they pretend to have refined tastes, collecting books, paintings, and antiques. Taking it a step further, they divert funds to charitable and public safety endeavors, seeking fame and reputation and hoping to gain medals and titles. America today is showing such tendencies, reversing its founding ideology by awarding medals and now imitating Britain by creating titles.</p>
<p>British and American Ideologies Cannot Unite</p>
<p>America's fundamental ideology lies in breaking free from British shackles and pursuing freedom, equality, and independence. Therefore, its educational policy also emphasizes this. Books about American history and textbooks used in elementary schools portray the American Revolutionary War as the most righteous act for the sake of humanity. This also reveals why the British and Americans can never truly unite. Americans revere Washington as a god, and even three-year-olds know his name and show respect. However, in American Canada, many children do not know Washington's name. History textbooks used in Canadian elementary schools provide a very brief account of the American Revolutionary War and criticize Washington for betraying the British mainland. The reason why the British and Americans cannot reconcile is therefore quite clear.</p>
<p>America's ideology of freedom, equality, and independence shapes its domestic and foreign policy. We can first observe its domestic politics. Their founding ideology is based on democracy, and their political ideology stems from this. All political institutions are based on this, and all policies are pursued according to this principle. Citizens form political organizations themselves, and representatives of the people operate the government. Apart from adopting a democratic system, it is not much different from other countries. However, America is like the original home of democracy in the world. Even during the Yalta Conference, it mutually agreed with small European countries to adopt democracy to prevent the spread of communist forces. It also encouraged democracy in Chongqing to prevent the tendency of Chongqing's national essence.</p>
<p>Democracy and Material Life</p>
<p>One characteristic of the United States is that when guiding the people, it equates democracy with the American way of life. It believes that the American way of life is the most ideal, with every family equipped with cars and electric refrigerators, where anyone can freely speak their mind, live freely, and enjoy the true pleasures of life. However, this is a grave misconception. Upon closer examination, we cannot conclude that material life is a result of democracy. The abundance of American life is solely due to its vast and fertile lands. Many European countries have no colonies, and even if they adopt democracy, they cannot become as wealthy as the Americans. Yet, America instructs its people in this way. Recently, it told its people that because Germany and Japan threatened American democracy, they must be defeated, explaining that America originally sought freedom and equality in its war of independence, broke away from Britain, and established the American way of life. Therefore, it must rise up to defend against this threat and further extend the American way of life to China and Southeast Asia to improve the lives of the people there. This is utter deception. America fought in Europe because it was threatened! And the Greater East Asia War was fought entirely within the Greater East Asia region, and currently it is being fought in parts of Japanese territory. Japan has never threatened American democracy, but America has threatened Japan's survival. America's expansion of democracy has become interference in the internal affairs of other countries and a threat to the survival of other nations, completely contradicting the essence of democracy.</p>
<p>The Degeneration of the Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>Furthermore, what ideological principles have arisen from America's founding ideology in its foreign policy? One is the Monroe Doctrine, the second is the Open Door Policy towards China, and the third is the Non-Recognition Doctrine towards Manchuria. The first, the Monroe Doctrine, is a policy towards Europe, stating that America's affairs should be handled freely by Americans, and Europe should not interfere, and America should not interfere in European affairs. This was President Monroe's declaration. The fundamental idea of this doctrine is to block the voice of European countries on the American continent, and it can be said that America completely broke away from Europe and declared independence. In reality, this was a policy of not wanting Europe to interfere in the freedom of America. However, after World War I, when America sent troops, the Monroe Doctrine was self-destructed. The American Senate opposed President Wilson's League of Nations and returned to the previous Monroe Doctrine, adhering to this doctrine until the outbreak of World War II. But after the outbreak of World War II, because America's Lend-Lease Act could not completely separate itself from European issues, it directly intervened in the European war with the opportunity of the Greater East Asia War. Currently, America intervenes in all European issues, even convening the United Nations Conference and creating a world organization. One aspect of America's Monroe Doctrine sternly insists that European countries should not interfere in American issues, while the other aspect completely abandons the attitude of "America does not interfere in European issues." From the perspective of the division of thought among all Americans, there are still those who adhere to the pure Monroe Doctrine, and these are called isolationists. Isolationists have seemingly disappeared on the surface, but the pure Monroe Doctrine still remains in the minds of the people. If America were to weaken and become impoverished, this pure Monroe Doctrine might resurface.</p>
<p>Open Door Policy Towards China</p>
<p>What will happen after the European war comes to an end? America's concern for European issues will naturally diminish, thus creating an objective situation for the revival of the pure Monroe Doctrine. However, America's leaders have paid a heavy price in Europe, completely changed their previous ways, and do not want to return to the pure Monroe Doctrine. They want to revise the Monroe Doctrine. Since last year, various international conferences have been held in the United States, such as the International Monetary Conference, the Dumbarton Oaks Security Conference, and the San Francisco Conference, to get Americans to agree to revising the Monroe Doctrine. Secondly, the "Open Door Policy" came about after the Russo-Japanese War, when various countries demanded concessions and leased territories in China, intending to divide China. US Secretary of State John Hay opposed the great powers making harsh demands on China and advocated that China should open its doors so that all countries would have equal opportunities. Japan and China became semi-colonies to curb the ambitions of other countries, while at the same time Hay hoped that the United States itself would also gain a share of the rights. He distorted the "principle of equality" of the American founding ideology. This Open Door Policy formed the basis of America's policy towards Asia. Any country that attempts to rise in Asia will inevitably conflict with this policy. When the Nine-Power Treaty was signed, this policy was further turned into a treaty, making the ideologies of various countries consistent with the United States. Later, China's independent and sovereign atmosphere became strong, and the rise of Japanese forces after the Manchurian Incident caused flaws in American policy. At that time, the diplomatic policies of Japan and the United States in East Asia were in opposition.</p>
<p>Non-Recognition Doctrine Towards Manchuria</p>
<p>Third is the "Non-Recognition Doctrine towards Manchuria," which can also be said to be a development of the "Open Door Policy." According to them, changes in territory should respect the free will of the people, and changes in territory by force will never be recognized, explaining that this is based on the "principle of freedom." However, the so-called "Open Door Policy" and "Non-Recognition Doctrine towards Manchuria" all contradict and conflict with America's own principles. The first point is why America does not apply the "Monroe Doctrine" in East Asia. If the "Monroe Doctrine" is maintained in Europe, then the "Monroe Doctrine" should also be adopted in East Asia. America does not interfere in East Asia, and East Asia does not interfere in America. Only in this way does it conform to the "principle of equality." Second, America demands that East Asia, especially China, open its doors, but why does it severely restrict East Asians from entering American territory and impose inhumane and unequal treatment on East Asians? How can the oppression of blacks in the United States be explained according to the "equality" principle of the founding ideology? How can the unequal treatment of East Asians be explained?</p>
<p>Again, the Nations Become Colonies</p>
<p>America seeks freedom, equality, and independence, and the nations of the world equally seek freedom, equality, and independence, especially in Southeast Asia, which has been a colony of other countries for more than a century. This time, they have the opportunity to gain independence and enjoy freedom and equality. However, at the San Francisco Conference, America advocated exploiting the independence of these regions and turning them into colonies again, implementing joint management.</p>
<p>In short, America's principles and claims all contradict themselves. However, I believe that such principles and claims will ultimately not be accepted by the people of the world, and there will inevitably be breakdowns. For the progress of mankind, it will also promote its disintegration.</p>
