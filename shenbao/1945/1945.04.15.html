<h3>冲繩南部日軍反攻　名護灣北方激戰　日空軍沉毀敵艦船十二艘</h3>
<p>日大本營發表</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日大本營十四日下午六時發表：　冲繩本島陸上戰况如次，南部地區之日軍步兵及砲兵，於緊密之聯絡下，自十二日傍晚起，於陣前反攻敵軍，摧毀敵軍攻勢企圖，刻正擴大戰果中·名護灣北方東部半島地區之日軍，刻正與來襲之敵軍約一師團展開繳戰，使北飛機塲發生直徑一千公尺高度達三千公尺之爆炸。　日特攻機隊繼續猛攻該島周圍之敵艦船，迄十二日拂曉止，業經查明之戰果如次：擊沉巡洋艦一艘，運輸船一艘，艦型不詳者五艘，擊毀巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘，運轍船一艘，艦型不詳者一艘。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　冲繩鳥南部地區日軍，十二日全體實行反攻，得砲隊援獲之助，逐漸壓　敵軍退至北方，至十三日正午，進達一〇三二高地，一〇五二高地，宜野灣及大山之一綫，其他日軍有力部隊，亦深入敵中，擊碎其陣地，使之陷於混亂。</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地十四日中央社電　日航空部隊十二日晨以戰鬥機，轟炸機急襲冲繩本烏北部，中部飛機塲，全部炸彈命中飛機塲，悉加炸毀。日機並在奄美羣鳥東方團剿敵艦艇，經猛力攻擊後，擊毀驅逐艦一艘。嗣又急襲冲繩本鳥殘波岬海面敵艦艇集團，擊毀驅逐艦一艘。</p>
<h3>日軍第二次　特攻總攻擊　冲繩事已達最高潮</h3>
<p>前線甚地十四日中央社電　日陸海軍各基地，十一日白晝同時開始，對冲繩四周敵機動部隊實施第二次特攻總攻擊，自六·七兩日第一次總攻擊後，冲繩本島日·美雙方激戰到達空前高潮，此爲大東亞戰事發生以來最嚴重局面，日海陸軍第二次總攻擊，抱捩轉大局之決心，希望第二次總攻擊後，不復有第三次攻擊，如有第三次攻擊必要時，則必然採取攻擊崩潰敵軍，亦即必須出動所有後備航空兵力，全力以赴。現在開始之第二次總攻擊，爲決定民族興亡之決戰中的決戰，然使戰局趨於目前情勢者，其要素當有賴第一次總攻擊之成效，因氣候惡劣關係，第一次與第二次間有兩三日之間隔，但此並非單純的時間經過，並在此兩次總攻擊間，巳引起戰局極大變化。</p>
<p>敵方消耗超過預料</p>
<p>第一次總攻擊中，敵已損傷艦船將近百艘，敵受此打擊後，在此數日內已可以看出難以諱飾之動搖，敵方消耗，漸次超過敵軍司令部之預料，敵機動部隊今已仰求英艦隊言，或不致於到如此地步，或此爲一時的戰力減弱，然觀乎眼前事實，所以敵方於受到第一次總攻擊後努力接濟，以及全部兵力被深誘人琉球海面，此均爲第一次總攻擊之奏效，日軍把握此時機，乃採取第二次攻擊。當此冲繩決戰現階段，其重要性在於敵方接濟路線遙長以及日航空基地能取置陸·海軍戰鬥機等兩點，易言之，即出動總攻擊之日軍魂魄，當能永久消耗敵方之物量戰術。</p>
<p>日戰鬥機出擊奏捷</p>
<p>由部太平洋基地十四日中央社電　日新銳戰鬥機隊，十二日下午在喜界島上空邀擊巨人型敵機六十架，當擊落二十三架，當夜復在冲繩羣島東方海面急襲敵艦艇集團，當有艦型不詳之敵艦一艘以上被擊毀起火，又於本島海面攻擊敵運輸船隊，轟沉小型運輸船一艘，擊毀中型運轍船一艘，發生火災。再十二日敵艦上機來襲冲繩本島時，共計約五百數十架。</p>
<h3>緬甸英印軍　食糧極恐慌</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫十四日中央社電　緬甸中部之日軍，十二日實行巧妙作戰，編組捕捉敵汽車部隊，專攻擊敵汽車，結果擊燬其貨車五輛，擊破貨車四十五輛，其他車輛十輛。</p>
<p>緬甸前錢十四日中央社電　敵步兵部隊攻入梅克迭拉後，即被日軍包圍，柬南亞洲司令官蒙特巴頓等，乃赴瓦城舉行閱兵式，以宜傳昂揚，然其實際，敵軍已發表食糧困難。今次敵軍强徵軍用米，農村完全恐慌，前方英兵或印度兵奪取陣亡將士所携米袋逃走之情形，到處可見，足證其食糧恐慌如何深刻矣。又一般居民反英惑情極大，梅克迭拉某農村村長，見英軍侵入保馬拉地區，通報日兵五人，並使之化裝平民，救出重圍，而送至日軍主力陣地。</p>
<p>飯沼總裁誓言復仇</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　飯沼神祇院副總裁參拜明治神宮，報吿不撓不屈之戰意，誓言復仇，發表如次談話：敵美空軍之轟炸，實已超過盲炸之野蠻又野歟的攻擊，前曾侵犯伊勢神宮之神域，又以燒夷彈轟燬熱田神宮·北野·座間·阿部野·湊川等社，今又轟炸一億國民敬仰之明治神宮本殿及拜殿，不堪恐懼，社殿雖已燒失，然靈代平安無事耳，本人報吿神明，一億國民決意復仇。</p>
<p>松島部長發表談話</p>
<p>中央社訊　敵美飛機十三日晚空襲東京時，竟蔑視戰爭規則，對於日本首都施行無差別之盲炸，並對日本國民敬仰之明冶神宮亦投燒夷彈，以致發生火災。友邦駐華艦隊報道部長松鳥大佐，關於此事發表如下見解：敵美陸海軍在過去三週間冲繩方面之戰鬥，因受重大損害，尤其太平洋艦隊已陷於滿身創痍，同時加以大總統羅斯福之暴卒，敵軍在精神上遭受大打擊，敵美爲隱蔽如此國內外窮苦情形，遂不顧一切，攻擊日本國內之非軍事設施及無事民衆，殊爲明顯。換言之，敵方採用如此卑劣手段，足證日前所受損失極大，最近駐華美空軍之有力基地老河口被日陸軍奪取，故於十四日未曉，對上海地區施行游擊性之空襲，其手段實同樣卑劣也。凡吾東亞人士，應盡全力一致協力奮鬥，一掃共同之敵人。</p>
<h3>宮城治神宮被炸　日全民異常憤激　鈴木首相昨晨晋宮謝罪</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日鈴木首相對美機盲炸宮城，明治神宮之暴舉，殊爲恐懼，於十四日上午十時半晋曰宮謝罪，復於下午五時半發表談話稱：十三日夜來襲東京之敵機，竟向宮城大宮御所及赤坂離宮投彈，幷炸燬明治神宮之本殿·拜殿·然宮中之三殿則安然無恙。又明治神宮之御靈，已敬謹奉遷，此種事態，爲臣者深爲惶恐之至，余今晨特晋宮，幷參拜明治神宮，敬謹謝罪。敵機前次對伊勢神宮出此暴舉，今復對宮城及明治神宮出以同樣不敬不遜之暴舉，實屬可憎。吾人對此無不深爲憤激，余於此更鞏固完遂戰爭之決意，與一億國民共同努力，澈底擊碎天神不容之驕敵，以安聖慮。</p>
<h3>夜襲東京敵機　擊落四一架　予以損害者約八十架</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日大本營十四日下午四時發表：　十三日下午十一時起，歷約四小時之久，B29型敵機約一百七十架，其大部份來襲東京，投下炸彈及燒夷彈，對市街地區濫施轟炸，宮城大宮御所及赤坂離宮內二部建築物，亦因之發生火災，但旋即被撲滅，惟明治神宮之本殿及拜殿則毀。至東京二處火災，大部於十四日下午二時以前熄滅。　日制空部隊所獲邀擊戰果，已判明者如下，擊落四十一架，予以損害者約八十架。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之B29型轟炸機一百七十架，十三日晚十一時，對東京地區實施夜間轟炸，初時敵機一羣沿小笠原羣島伊豆列島北上，而於十一時起，其主力由房總半島方面，其他一部由平塚方面，分成小隊或單獨侵入東京，由三千米或四千米之高空施行波狀攻擊，對市街各處投下炸彈及燒夷彈，經四小時後，其主力由銚子方面，其他一部由平塚方面逃去。另一隊敵機，亦於同一時間來　千棄，琦玉兩縣。</p>
<p>台灣掃射</p>
<p>台北十三日中央社電　十三日晟起，敵艦載機約七十架，兩度來襲台灣北部地區，用機槍掃射台北，新竹飛機塲，下午十時許向東方海上遁去。又該日下午自菲島基地起飛之敵轟炸機二十數架，戰鬥機十六架，來襲台南，台中地區，用機槍掃射彰仁巿及台南州下之軍事設備後，於下午三時許前逐漸向南方遁去，日方擊落其戰鬥機二架。</p>
<p>粵港空襲</p>
<p>廣州十四日中央社電　敵機於十四日二時二十五分侵入本巿巿區，因防空砲火之威脅，不敢代飛，旋於河南馬涌橋碼頭，鳳安橋等地盲目投彈，即行遁去。</p>
<p>廣州十三日中央社電　菲島基地美空軍，十三日下午一時，以B24型機約三十架來襲廣州，香港，波狀攻擊廣州之外橋住宅區，以及香港之船舶港灣設備，但受日方高射砲火阻遏，二時半逐次向東南海上遁去。</p>

<h3>淮海紀行　徐州風光</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>京道上</p>
<p>月之一日，記者在首都隨同民衆代表大會之北方代表團一行，在暮色薈茫中，乘輪渡江，到達浦口，因車站秩序紛亂，躭擱多時，於九時半始得入站。所謂大會招待組為代表等預定之車廂，泰半皆已鳩佔鵲巢，而代表多人反無座位。列車較規定時間遲開一小時，於十一時始行離站。車廂狹小，旅客衆多，兼以車窗失修，　皆不能開啓，致空氣汚濁，且悶熱異常，旅客稱苦。</p>
<p>次日中午十二時十分，車抵符離集站，停車時間，村中警報之聲忽而下車避入附近設備簡陋之防空壕。按此種毫無掩蓋。戰壕式之防空壕，離車僅咫尺，於事無補。路局無旅客安全着想，實宜改善，記者與旅客之一部，皆停留車上，靜候命運之演變。約五分鐘敵機已臨吾人之所在地，記者目睹銀色P51型之敵機三架低飛掠上空而過，兩小時後警報解除。列車繼續前進。午後七時車抵徐州。</p>
<p>氣候變幻</p>
<p>到達徐州之日，此間之氣候，宛如江南之仲夏，悶熱非凡。但隔夕狂風聚作，則又寒冷異常，不亞嚴冬，且於四日竟降大雪，三數日中氣候突變如是，實出意外。據此間之老農云，今番之春雪影響農作頗巨。</p>
<p>旅館難覔</p>
<p>住宿問題，在徐州實感嚴重，巿內大小旅館家家客滿，其原因以目前徐州市爲淮海省會所在，公務員及軍人往來頻繁，兼因年來人口驟增。（現全市爲二十五萬人左右）而民房過少，不足容納，故此輩頗多長期租住旅館，平常甚少更動，致初來旅客借宿困難。記者徬徨終宵，一籌莫展，最後商得逆旅主人之同意，於其賬房間中，臨時搭舖，始吿解決。</p>
<p>巿容一斑</p>
<p>目前的徐州巿，宛如沙漠中的一朶鮮花，雖先天的環境條件欠佳，但經官民努力合作，許多偉大之建築物皆已次第吿成。路政推進，更不遺餘力。</p>
<p>徐州鬧市，集中於公明街道平路正大街等處，商店中以雜糧及南貨五洋等爲多。街道亦較他處城鄕寬闊，至集市則有南關外，雲龍山脚廣塲上之「曉市」（又稱小市），至爲興旺。其中以布攤爲大宗，次爲日用品，商民張蓬搭蓆，蝟集於此。</p>
<p>物價民食</p>
<p>淮海向產大量之小麥，故此間麵粉之價格每斤僅百元，爲民衆主要食物。此間農民一般生活較爲寬裕，惟食糧則以雜糧爲生。米則所產甚少。皆仰給江浙及安徽等省，目前因交通不便，僅恃諸安徽之蚌埠蕪湖諸地，但無大量運輸僅賴小販之零星運入，供外鄕人之需要，價格最近爲每擔四萬兩千元。至其他主要食糧及日用品物價略舉如後：肉每斤四百元，白菜一百五十元，菠菜一百八十元，生油每斤三百元，雞蛋每隻二十五元。</p>
<p>警防團員</p>
<p>徐州現有中日合組警防團，團員共計萬餘人，華人佔十分之六，全體黑色制服，整潔非常，手持白藤桿，上有鐵鈞之長竿，頗爲嚴肅。每日操練甚勤，常整隊在街頭遊行。彼等最重要之任務，即爲空襲期間的服務，警報發出後，沿街佈防，行動迅速，服務認眞。</p>
<p>星期代論</p>
<h3>羅斯福死後對於反軸心國的影響</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>—四月十四日在上海電台廣播詞</p>
<p>美國總統羅斯福逝世的消息，對於反軸心國，確是晴天霹靂一樣的大打擊。現在，我們所欲研究的，是他死了以後，對於美國本國，對於英國蘇聯與重慶，會發生怎樣的影響？</p>
<p>從美國國內所受影響而言，當然非常嚴重的。美國雖然號稱民主國，但是野心大的總統，就可取得變相獨裁的地位。羅斯福就是一例。他曾破例地四次被選爲總統，在政治經濟軍事各方面，久已替自已造成獨裁的地位。美國唯一可以依據憲法而限制總統大權的議會，近來雖曾以征用法案爲中心，不斷和他發生對立，但他善於運用權術，利用國內外輿論·操縱議會，强化了他的獨裁權，把持全國軍政大權。因此，他的逝世，對於美國，無論在政治上經濟上軍事上，都受到嚴重的震動。</p>
<p>從反軸心國所受的影嚮而言，可分三方面來硏究：</p>
<p>第一，受打擊最大的，莫過於英國了。我們當還記得，一九四〇年六月法國對德屈服的時候，英國本國已危如累卵，德國大軍隨時可以踏沉英倫三島，那時成爲戰局之轉捩點，使德國對蘇開戰而拯救了英國危機的，就是羅斯福。原來羅斯福　於袖手旁觀歐局的政策，已喪失了一個法國，將來德國戰勝，美國亦不能安枕，所以轉變方針，一面開始準備戰爭，擴張軍備，一面暗中支援英國，是年八月英美成立協定，美國以驅逐艦五十艘交換英國屬領諸　基地，其後更發展而成爲對英軍火租借法案，使敗退的英軍爲之一振。到了一九四一年六月德國轉鋒束向以後，英國更全靠羅斯福政策的支持，積極恢復戰力。這樣堅持英美協力恢復資本帝國主義世界秩序的羅斯福，現在中途逝世，英國在軍事上今後就有孤獨之慮，在外交上亦處於對蘇劣勢，無怪邱吉爾一聞他的噩耗，震駭得不知所措了。</p>
<p>第二，因羅斯福逝世受到重大打擊的，當然要算重慶。中日事變以來，重慶的所謂「盟國」，因爲蘇聯的關係，始終未見好轉，英國亦自顧不暇，致有一九四○年封鎖滇緬路等非友誼舉動，其間只有羅斯福領導下的美國，被重慶視爲救星。現在，正常舊金山會議開幕期前，正想仰仗羅斯福的援手，而圖實現幻想之時，羅斯福突然逝世，難怪重慶也與倫敦同樣震駭不知所措了。</p>
<p>第三，對於蘇聯，雖然沒有什麼重大的影響，但是羅斯福是英美蘇三强會議的主動者，是開羅，德黑蘭和克里米亞會議的發動者，並且是蘇英之問矛盾的調和者，死後，反軸心各國問的矛盾對立必因喪失道位居間折衝者而趨於尖銳化，則對蘇聯亦不無打擊，而羅斯福同時也為唯一足以相當抑制蘇聯的人物，從他逝世以後，反軸心國已沒有一個足以相當使蘇聯就範的人了，將來蘇聯在歐洲的活動，更爲促使英美蘇間新予盾的主要因素。</p>
<p>最後，說到對於東亞戰局的影響，我們還不能作過大的估價。但是，羅斯福是大東亞戰爭的促成者，早在一九四〇—四一年間，他就有經濟封鎖日本的計劃，其後更迫而以外交及軍事活動，倡導所謂ABCD對日封鎖戰綫，逼得日本不能不為自衛自存而對美宣戰。自從大東亞戰爭爆發以來，他又一向是發動對日總反攻及進攻日本本土戰略的主張及實行者。現在他已死了，美國的戰略，在統帥和戰術上當不無發生紛岐的可能。</p>
<p>現在繼羅斯福而為美國領導的，是一個所謂「從黑暗中崛起之平凡老人」，無論在政治上經濟上乃至外交上，其資望與實力都不是可與羅斯福同日而語的人物，能否担負起決戰階段內外交困中的重任，確是一個疑問。我們站在大東亞參戰國的立塲，覺得敵方陣營的弱化，自然同時有利於我，不過也不能過於樂觀而必須深切警惕而奮鬥不懈。</p>

<h3>預檢情形</h3>

<h3>羅委員長訓詞</h3>
<p>市區保甲委員會羅兼委員長訓詞，略謂：（此次保甲自警團舉行春季檢閱，於今日舉行預檢，本人到場參加，深覺各位精神充沛，至為振奮，對保甲前途，保甲自警團前途，上海青年人前途，以及上海前途發生了樂觀與感想。</p>
<p>上海在未編製保甲前，大家對保甲組織頗加懷疑，如今事實已擺於我人眼前，不但有健全的保甲組織，並且產生了自警團員，各位青年同志，均已受相當的軍事訓練，已將過去疑雲，在今日完全打破，確信改造上海及建設上海，更可增強信心，增加勇氣，可謂改造上海的精神，建設上海的精神。已從保甲上充分表示。</p>
<p>今天預檢，從客觀方面而言，精神飽滿；在訓練上尚感不足，服裝欠統一，今後我人當應逐渐改革。我們為求國家之統一，必須民從統一，　旨統一，方有統一國家，保甲自警團既有軍事訓練，在軍事上必須統一化，今後希望應有合理的計劃，從形式統一，做到精神統一，從小的方面，做到大的方面，則對國家民族，亦有所貢獻。</p>
<p>我們檢閱的時間頗少，其目的為求訓練進步央今次首次檢閱後，希望各位應更加奮發，增強勇氣，熱烈參加以擔當目前更重大任務，此對保甲工作同志所殷切期望。深信各位明日更有熱烈精神，此乃本人所預望者）。</p>
<h3>李處長報告警局司法行政　記者便會中解答各問題</h3>
<p>市宣處於昨（十四）日上午十時，在市　　　舉行第十二次記者例會，到各報社記者十餘人，由警察局第三處處長李時雨出席解答，各項問題甚群。茲分讀如次：</p>
<h3>第三處機構之改革</h3>
<p>1.第三處最近工作推進情形如何？（答）第三處原為司法處，此次警局為改革機構，易名第三處，惟仍司理一切司法事務，業務並無變更。組織方面，原　五科一所，現改為三科一所，為防犯科，偵察科，煙毒查緝科，拘留所。人事方面，亦經調整，原共有八百餘人，現減為處內一七九人，各分局司法警察共五百餘人。業務方面力求敏捷，確實簡便，以解民苦，而保障民權。若前各分局之司法案件，須送總務處收發料，再轉送第三處，手續麻煩，費時甚多，現已改善，由各分局直送第三處處長辦公室。且前是項司法案件先由偵察科審查，現已由處長辦公室自行審查，由處長認可蓋章後，當日最遲至翌晨即發還分局移解地檢署查辦，即其他各機關請求協助辦理之案件，亦力求敏捷，完全省去不必要之手續。偵察科專辦局內所偵緝查獲，以及市府或兼局長發交之資職等案件。　犯科及認識科已合併，　認識與防犯，頗有關係，亦為求簡便之一則，對防犯工作，亦極力推進，從事強化。</p>
<h3>偵查密訊案情手續</h3>
<p>２．貴處及各分局偵查案情及密訊手續如何？關押日數有無規定？交保案處有無統一辦法及一定之範圍，案情特殊者如何處理？（答）本局對於偵查案情密訊手續，均遵照刑事訴訟辦法，將案犯尽量於二十四小時內解地檢署，而視案情之輕重，請求　押日期，協助檢察官偵查案情，務求確實。至於交保辦法，當依照法寶於嫌疑人最高本弄在三年下者改選交保。惟查埠情形特殊，　盜犯十九一再累犯，故不履行交保，唯敏捷將案辦竣，押解地檢署查辦，案情特殊有連續或囤積居奇，危害民國等，須解特别法庭密訊之案件，除市長交下者外，當呈報局長再呈市長，由市長認定重大，轉呈國府主席核定後，移解特殊法庭密辦。</p>
<h3>職案件輸情形</h3>
<p>３．悒市　職案已有多起，已移送法院者　何案？尚在偵查中者有幾案？（答）進來當局對　職案件，非常關注，均嚴加查辦，除前市府職員盜賣煤　公產二案，已奉陳代主席論，移解首都特别法庭查辦外，案已查竣，呈報市長核查中，尚有數案，現正在偵密中，至於案情未便公開發表。</p>
<h3>離奇命案應采對策</h3>
<p>４．最近各處發生命案，類多離奇，其對策如何，並對於防犯工作之影響如何？（答）社會環境越复雜，則罪案之發生當越離奇，其對策惟極力推進防犯工作，從心理改善，他如報紙對是項新聞之登報，不過事描寫，並分辨是非，說明利害，一案之發生與論界予以嚴格之批評，當局依法嚴辦，明正典弄，以敬效尤。惟防犯工作方始推進，未能發揮最高力量，尚望各界協力。</p>
<h3>偏僻區域警察勒索</h3>
<p>５．貴處對於不良長警之勒索行為，已具撲減決心，但校偏僻道路，如巡邏警，交通警，犯勒索警，將以何法制裁或補救？（答）本局自周兼局長接任以來，對整頓警紀，已下最大決心，對犯法之員警，決予重辦，並由周兼局長以行政院副院長資格，曾有司法官談話，對　職官員，依法嚴懲，絕對不得輕易保釋，嚴重者當解特别法庭查辦。至於偏僻道路之警察勒索案情事，當由督察處强化督察工作，予以督　查察，以　恶風。</p>
<h3>豬肉零售商　昨日停市</h3>
<p>本市豬肉昨日忽各絕跡，經記者調查，因豬肉零售商為公定價格所限，不願高價向批發商進貨所致，故相率自動停業，聞豬肉零售商同業公會方面，除呈報有關當局迅予救濟外，正勸　同業會員設法恢复營業。</p>

<h3>松本大尉　闡述最近戰局　建設青年隊舉行座談會</h3>
<p>中國建設青年隊十五日下午二時假南京路（沙利文）三樓，舉行時事座談會，東　本市各民眾團體代表出席，並敦請日本艦隊報道部松本大尉演講。除到松本大尉及該隊顧問秘書等外，中華洪門總會，東亞聯盟中國總會上海分會，中國反共同盟會等民眾團體，亦派員出席。首由松本大尉演講，對太平洋戰局，中國大陸戰況，以及美總統羅斯福逝世與世界政局之影響等，闡述至至為詳尽。繼由各團體代表，就時局問題，交換意見。</p>
<h3>太平洋戰局</h3>
<p>松本大尉演講內容要旨：１．沖繩島戰略，如日俄海戰時之性質，引敵深入後，予以一興擊潰。２．敵方誇大宣傳，謂進攻沖繩島艦艇有一四零零艘之多，但實際作戰者僅六百餘艘工，其中百餘艘等為登陸用舟艇，再除去運輸船只，於第一線參加作戰者，不過百餘艘，合計沖繩周圍，亦僅三百餘艦，連日經日軍之狙擊，已損失大半。３．麥克沃塞之基地作戰法，須相當時間，不能達到速戰速決之目的，而用尼米茲跳島作戰法，乘虛而進，以為獲得制海及制空襲後，即可不顧不切。但須知巴拉島，拉巴爾諸島，猶在日軍之手，尼米茲采用之戰法，乃由於美國內背景所致，其戰法在沖繩一戰，即將發生障礙，而影響於整個太平洋戰局。</p>
<h3>大陸作戰</h3>
<p>渝方集中兵力，企圖奪回邯州，日軍以巧妙戰略，將其擊退，再戰逐州。２．過去在渝美空軍對勢漢線嚴施轟炸，其基地即為老河口，四月初日軍已將該地占領，現其　　地帶，尚有小規模之作戰，不久即可解決。３．老河口過去為控制華中華北及東海一帶之重要基地，今一變為日軍戟重隊之有力基地。</p>
<h3>羅斯福逝世</h3>
<p>１．美副總統僅能事務上工作，其能否應付軍需生產及各有力者，很成問題。就國際情形觀之。特羅曼是否能操縱邱吉爾史太林，亦屬疑義。２．對華政策方面，過去重廣軍火借款，均操於羅氏之手，今後是否能加深進行，亦蜀可慮。</p>
<p>簡訊</p>
<p>警局整頓警察醫院市警察局對前衛生局管理之警察醫院，奉令正式接收，直接管理，院長一職派魏怡春充任，已到局辦公，並決定在成都路及中華路分調警察診療所直蜀該院管理，以俾員警之治療。</p>
<p>華輸公司新社長將就職　中華輸船公司增資改組已經該公司社員大會通過，新任社長姜西園聞定於本月十六日就職視事。</p>
<p>方君璧書展展斯截止　名書家方君璧女士自本月十二日起至十五日止，假本市成陽路日華俱樂部舉行個人燦書展覽會，所得書值，全數充廣東鳴崧學校基金，日來參觀者，極為跳躍，訂購書展者亦極眾多，惟展覽時間有限，每日觀眾向隅者頗多，故特自十六日起延長會期兩天，至十七日截止。</p>
<p>崔承喜表演展期　崔承喜女士此次來悒假大華大劇院表演舞踴，精彩紛呈，觀眾極為擁擠，原定表演至十四日為止，茲應觀眾要求展期一天，至十五日截止。</p>

<h3>Japanese Counterattack in Southern Okinawa; Fierce Fighting North of Nago Bay; Japanese Air Force Sinks or Destroys Twelve Enemy Ships</h3>
<p>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announcement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM on the 14th: The land battle situation on Okinawa Island is as follows: Japanese infantry and artillery in the southern area, in close coordination, have been counterattacking the enemy in front of their lines since the evening of the 12th, thwarting the enemy's offensive attempts and are currently expanding their gains. Japanese forces in the eastern peninsula region north of Nago Bay are currently engaged in battle with approximately one division of attacking enemy forces, causing an explosion at the northern airfield with a diameter of 1,000 meters and a height of 3,000 meters. Japanese special attack aircraft squadrons continue to fiercely attack enemy ships around the island. As of dawn on the 12th, the confirmed results are as follows: Sunk one cruiser, one transport ship, and five ships of unidentified type; destroyed one cruiser, one destroyer, one transport ship, and one ship of unidentified type.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese forces in the southern Okinawa area launched a full-scale counterattack on the 12th, and with the aid of artillery support, gradually pushed the enemy back to the north. By noon on the 13th, they had advanced to a line including Heights 1032 and 1052, Ginowan, and Oyama. Other powerful Japanese units have also penetrated deep into enemy territory, shattering their positions and throwing them into confusion.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese air units, on the morning of the 12th, launched a surprise attack with fighters and bombers on the northern and central airfields of Okinawa Island, with all bombs hitting the airfields, causing complete destruction. Japanese aircraft also ambushed enemy ships east of the Amami Islands, destroying one destroyer after a fierce attack. Subsequently, they launched another surprise attack on enemy ship groups off Cape Zanpa on Okinawa Island, destroying one destroyer.</p>
<h3>Second Japanese Total Special Attack; Okinawa Situation Reaches Peak</h3>
<p>Front Line Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese army and navy bases simultaneously began a second total special attack on enemy mobile forces around Okinawa at daylight on the 11th. Following the first total attack on the 6th and 7th, fierce fighting between Japanese and American forces on Okinawa Island has reached an unprecedented climax. This is the most serious situation since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Japanese army and navy are resolved to reverse the situation with the second total attack, hoping that there will be no need for a third attack after the second one. If a third attack is necessary, it will inevitably involve attacking the collapsing enemy forces, meaning that all reserve air power must be deployed with full force. The second total attack that has now begun is a decisive battle within a decisive battle that will determine the nation's fate. However, the factors that have led the battle situation to its current state depend on the success of the first total attack. Due to poor weather conditions, there was a gap of two or three days between the first and second attacks, but this was not merely a passage of time. Extremely large changes in the battle situation occurred between these two total attacks.</p>
<p>Enemy Casualties Exceed Expectations</p>
<p>In the first total attack, the enemy suffered damage to nearly one hundred ships. After suffering this blow, the enemy's unmistakable wavering has become evident in recent days. Enemy casualties are gradually exceeding the enemy command's expectations. The enemy's mobile forces are now relying on the British fleet. Even if it doesn't reach this point, or this is only a temporary weakening of combat power, judging from the facts before our eyes, the enemy's efforts to resupply after the first total attack, as well as the deep enticement of all their forces into the Ryukyu waters, are all due to the success of the first total attack. The Japanese army is seizing this opportunity to launch the second attack. At this current stage of the decisive battle for Okinawa, its importance lies in the enemy's long supply lines and the ability of Japanese air bases to deploy land and naval fighters. In other words, the spirit of the Japanese forces launching the total attack can permanently wear down the enemy's material warfare tactics.</p>
<p>Japanese Fighters' Successful Sorties</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese new-type fighter squadrons ambushed sixty giant enemy aircraft over Kikai Island on the afternoon of the 12th, shooting down twenty-three. That night, they launched a surprise attack on enemy ship groups in the waters east of the Okinawa Islands, destroying and setting fire to at least one enemy ship of unidentified type. They also attacked enemy transport convoys off the main island, sinking one small transport ship and destroying one medium-sized transport ship, causing a fire. On the 12th, enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked Okinawa Island, totaling approximately five hundred and several dozen aircraft.</p>
<h3>Food Shortage Grips British Indian Forces in Burma</h3>
<p>Burma Front, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese forces in central Burma carried out skillful operations on the 12th, organizing the capture of enemy motor vehicle units and specifically targeting enemy vehicles, resulting in the destruction of five trucks, the disabling of forty-five trucks, and the damaging of ten other vehicles.</p>
<p>Burma Front, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After enemy infantry units entered Meiktila, they were surrounded by Japanese forces. Lord Mountbatten, Commander-in-Chief of Southeast Asia Command, went to Mandalay to hold a military parade to boost morale, but in reality, the enemy army has declared a food shortage. This time, the enemy is forcibly requisitioning military rice, causing complete panic in rural villages. Situations where British or Indian soldiers on the front lines seize rice sacks carried by fallen soldiers and flee are visible everywhere, demonstrating how severe their food shortage is. Furthermore, the general population has extremely strong anti-British sentiments. The village chief of a certain village in Meiktila, seeing British forces invading the Pwama area, informed five Japanese soldiers and helped them disguise themselves as civilians, rescuing them from the encirclement and sending them to the main Japanese forces.</p>
<p>Vice President Iinuma Vows Revenge</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Iinuma, Vice President of the Shrine Board, visited Meiji Shrine, reported unwavering fighting spirit, vowed revenge, and issued the following statement: The bombing by enemy American air force has surpassed the barbaric and reckless attack of indiscriminate bombing, having previously violated the sacred grounds of Ise Grand Shrine, and then used incendiary bombs to destroy Atsuta Shrine, Kitano Shrine, Zama Shrine, Abeno Shrine, and Minatogawa Shrine. Now they have bombed the main hall and worship hall of Meiji Shrine, revered by 100 million people, causing unspeakable fear. Although the shrine buildings have been burned down, the sacred objects are safe and unharmed. I report to the gods that 100 million citizens are determined to take revenge.</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima Issues Statement</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report - When enemy American aircraft raided Tokyo on the night of the 13th, they disregarded the rules of war and carried out indiscriminate bombing of the Japanese capital, even dropping incendiary bombs on the Meiji Shrine, revered by the Japanese people, causing a fire. Colonel Matsushima, reporting minister of the fleet of a friendly nation stationed in China, issued the following views on this matter: In the past three weeks of fighting in the Okinawa area, the enemy American army and navy have suffered significant damage, especially the Pacific Fleet, which has been left badly battered. At the same time, the sudden death of President Roosevelt has dealt a major blow to the enemy's morale. In order to conceal these dire circumstances at home and abroad, the enemy is attacking Japan's non-military facilities and innocent civilians, regardless of everything. It is evident. In other words, the enemy's use of such vile means demonstrates the immense losses they have suffered recently. Recently, the powerful base of the American Air Force stationed in China, Laohekou, was seized by the Japanese army, so before dawn on the 14th, they carried out guerrilla-style air raids on the Shanghai area, their methods were equally vile. All of us in East Asia should do our best to work together and fight to eliminate our common enemy.</p>
<h3>Imperial Palace and Meiji Shrine Bombed; All Japanese People Exceptionally Outraged; Prime Minister Suzuki Offered Apologies to the Imperial Palace Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Prime Minister Suzuki of Japan was deeply fearful of the reckless bombing of the Imperial Palace and Meiji Shrine by American aircraft. He visited the Imperial Palace at 10:30 AM on the 14th to apologize, and then issued a statement at 5:30 PM saying: The enemy aircraft that raided Tokyo on the night of the 13th dropped bombs on the Imperial Palace's Omiya Palace and Akasaka Detached Palace, and also destroyed the main hall and worship hall of the Meiji Shrine. However, the three halls within the Imperial Palace are safe and unharmed. Furthermore, the spirit of Meiji Shrine has been respectfully moved. As a subject, I am deeply fearful of this kind of situation. This morning, I especially visited the Imperial Palace and visited Meiji Shrine to respectfully offer my apologies. The enemy aircraft committed a similar act of disrespect and recklessness against Ise Grand Shrine before, and now they have committed the same reckless act against the Imperial Palace and Meiji Shrine, which is truly hateful. All of us are deeply outraged by this. I hereby further strengthen my determination to complete the war, work together with 100 million citizens to thoroughly crush the arrogant enemy that Heaven will not tolerate, and to ease His Majesty's mind.</p>
<h3>Forty-One Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Night Raid on Tokyo; Approximately Eighty Others Damaged</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 14th: From 11:00 PM on the 13th, for approximately four hours, about 170 B-29 enemy aircraft, most of which raided Tokyo, dropped bombs and incendiary bombs, indiscriminately bombing urban areas. Two buildings within the Omiya Palace and Akasaka Detached Palace of the Imperial Palace also caught fire as a result, but were quickly extinguished. However, the main hall and worship hall of the Meiji Shrine were destroyed. Most of the two fires in Tokyo were extinguished before 2:00 PM on the 14th. The results of the Japanese air defense forces' interception, as far as have been confirmed, are as follows: forty-one shot down, approximately eighty others damaged.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - One hundred seventy B-29 bombers from the Mariana Islands base carried out a night bombing raid on the Tokyo area at 11:00 PM on the 13th. Initially, a group of enemy aircraft moved north along the Ogasawara Islands and Izu Islands, and from 11:00 PM, the main force approached Tokyo from the Boso Peninsula area, while another part approached from the Hiratsuka area, dividing into small teams or entering Tokyo alone. They carried out wave attacks from an altitude of 3,000 or 4,000 meters, dropping bombs and incendiary bombs in various parts of the city. After four hours, the main force escaped from the Choshi area, while another part escaped from the Hiratsuka area. Another squadron of enemy aircraft also attacked Chiba and Saitama prefectures at the same time.</p>
<p>Strafe in Taiwan</p>
<p>Taipei, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - From dawn on the 13th, approximately seventy enemy carrier-based aircraft twice raided the northern area of Taiwan, strafing Taipei and Hsinchu airfields with machine guns, and fled eastward over the sea at around 10:00 PM. Also, that afternoon, twenty-odd enemy bombers and sixteen fighters taking off from a base in the Philippines raided the Tainan and Taichung areas, strafing military facilities in Changhua City and Tainan Prefecture with machine guns, and gradually fled southward at around 3:00 PM. Japanese forces shot down two of their fighters.</p>
<p>Air Raids on Canton and Hong Kong</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy aircraft invaded the urban area of this city at 2:25 PM on the 14th, and fearing the threat of anti-aircraft fire, did not dare to fly in place.

<p>Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - American air force from the Philippines base, at 1:00 PM on the 13th, raided Guangzhou and Hong Kong with approximately thirty B-24 aircraft, attacking the residential areas outside Guangzhou and the ship harbor facilities in Hong Kong in waves, but were deterred by Japanese anti-aircraft fire and gradually fled southeastward over the sea at 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Record of a Trip to Huaihai: Scenery of Xuzhou</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>On the Beijing Road</p>
<p>On the first of the month, the reporter accompanied a group of Northern delegates to the National People's Congress from the capital. As dusk gathered, we crossed the Yangtze River by ferry and arrived at Pukou. Due to the chaotic order at the station, we were delayed for a long time, and only entered the station at 9:30 PM. Most of the carriages that the so-called Congress reception group had reserved for the delegates had already been occupied by others, and many delegates had no seats. The train departed an hour late from the scheduled time, only leaving the station at 11:00 PM. The carriages were small and crowded with passengers, and because the windows were broken, none of them could be opened, resulting in polluted air and abnormal stuffiness. Passengers complained bitterly.</p>
<p>At 12:10 PM on the next day, the train arrived at Fuliji Station. During the stop, the sound of an air raid alarm in the village suddenly rang, and passengers got off the train to take shelter in the nearby poorly equipped air raid shelter. These trench-style air raid shelters, with no cover and only a short distance from the train, are of no use. The railway bureau does not think about passenger safety and should improve them. The reporter and some of the passengers stayed on the train, quietly waiting for fate to unfold. After about five minutes, enemy aircraft arrived at our location. The reporter witnessed three silver P-51 enemy aircraft flying low overhead. The alarm was lifted two hours later. The train continued its journey. At 7:00 PM, the train arrived in Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Changing Weather</p>
<p>On the day of arriving in Xuzhou, the climate here was like midsummer in Jiangnan, extraordinarily hot and stuffy. But the next evening, a strong wind gathered, and it became abnormally cold, no less than severe winter. Furthermore, it even snowed heavily on the 4th. Such sudden changes in the climate in the space of a few days were truly unexpected. According to local farmers, this spring snow will have a significant impact on crops.</p>
<p>Difficult to Find Lodging</p>
<p>The lodging problem is truly serious in Xuzhou. All of the large and small hotels in the city are full. The reason for this is that Xuzhou City is currently the seat of the Huaihai provincial government, and government officials and soldiers travel back and forth frequently. In addition, the population has increased sharply in recent years (the current city population is about 250,000), but there are too few residential houses to accommodate them, so many of these people rent rooms in hotels for long periods, rarely moving, making it difficult for newcomers to find accommodation. The reporter wandered all night, at a loss for what to do. Finally, after negotiating with the innkeeper, he agreed to set up a temporary bed in his accounting room, which finally solved the problem.</p>
<p>Glimpse of the City</p>
<p>The current city of Xuzhou is like a flower in the desert. Although the inherent environmental conditions are poor, many great buildings have been gradually completed through the cooperative efforts of officials and the people. The promotion of road administration is also being carried out with tireless efforts.</p>
<p>The bustling areas of Xuzhou are concentrated in Gongming Street, Pinglu Main Street, and other places. There are many shops selling miscellaneous grains and southern goods, Western goods, etc. The streets are also wider than in other urban and rural areas. As for the market, there is the "Dawn Market" (also known as Small Market) outside the South Gate, at the foot of Yunlong Mountain Square, which is very prosperous. Among them, cloth stalls are the most numerous, followed by daily necessities. Merchants and residents set up tents and mats, gathering here like hedgehogs.</p>
<p>Prices and Food</p>
<p>Huaihai produces a large amount of wheat, so the price of flour here is only 100 yuan per catty, which is the main food for the people. The general living standard of farmers here is relatively well-off, but they mainly eat miscellaneous grains. Very little rice is produced, all relying on Jiangzhe and Anhui provinces. Currently, due to inconvenient transportation, it relies only on Bengbu, Wuhu, and other places in Anhui, but without large-scale transportation, it relies only on small vendors' sporadic imports to meet the needs of people from other places. The price recently is 42,000 yuan per dan. The prices of other major food and daily necessities are listed as follows: meat 400 yuan per catty, cabbage 150 yuan, spinach 180 yuan, raw oil 300 yuan per catty, eggs 25 yuan each.</p>
<p>Police Defense Corps Members</p>
<p>Xuzhou currently has a Chinese-Japanese joint police defense corps, with more than 10,000 members, of whom Chinese account for six tenths. All wear neat black uniforms and carry white rattan canes with long iron hooks on them, which is quite solemn. They practice diligently every day, often parading in the streets in formation. Their most important task is to provide services during air raids. After the alarm is issued, they deploy along the streets quickly and serve conscientiously.</p>
<p>Weekly Commentary</p>
<h3>The Impact of Roosevelt's Death on the Anti-Axis Powers</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>—Broadcast Speech on Shanghai Radio on April 14th</p>
<p>The news of the death of American President Roosevelt is undoubtedly a devastating blow to the anti-Axis powers. What we want to study now is what kind of impact his death will have on the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the impact on the United States, it is of course very serious. Although the United States is known as a democratic country, presidents with great ambition can acquire a disguised dictatorial position. Roosevelt is one example. He was elected president four times, breaking the precedent, and had long established a dictatorial position for himself in politics, economics, and military affairs. The United States' only parliament that can restrict the president's power according to the constitution has been constantly at odds with him recently, centered on the Conscription Act, but he is good at using tactics, using domestic and foreign public opinion to manipulate the parliament, strengthening his dictatorial power, and controlling the country's military and political power. Therefore, his death has a serious shock to the United States, both politically, economically, and militarily.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the impact on the anti-Axis powers, it can be studied from three aspects:</p>
<p>First, the one that has suffered the most is undoubtedly Great Britain. We should remember that when France surrendered to Germany in June 1940, Great Britain was already in imminent danger. The German army could step on the British Isles at any time. At that time, it became a turning point in the war situation. It was Roosevelt who caused Germany to open up the war against the Soviet Union and save the British crisis. Originally, Roosevelt's policy of standing by and watching the European situation had lost a France. If Germany wins in the future, the United States will not be able to sleep peacefully. So he changed his policy, started preparing for war and expanding armaments. On one hand, he secretly supported Great Britain. In August of the same year, the United States and Great Britain reached an agreement, in which the United States exchanged 50 destroyers for bases in British territories. Later, it developed into the Lend-Lease Act for British military supplies, which boosted the defeated British army. Roosevelt, who insisted on British-American cooperation to restore the capitalist imperialist world order in this way, now died halfway. Great Britain is worried about being alone in military affairs in the future, and is also at a disadvantage in diplomacy with the Soviet Union. No wonder Churchill was shocked and at a loss when he heard the news of his death.</p>
<p>Second, Chongqing will certainly suffer a major blow due to Roosevelt's death. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Chongqing's so-called "Allies" have not improved due to the relationship with the Soviet Union. Great Britain was also unable to take care of itself, resulting in non-friendly acts such as the blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road in 1940. Only the United States under Roosevelt's leadership was regarded as a savior by Chongqing. Now, just before the opening of the San Francisco Conference, when they wanted to rely on Roosevelt's help to realize their illusions, Roosevelt suddenly died. No wonder Chongqing was as shocked and at a loss as London.</p>
<p>Third, although the Soviet Union was not greatly affected, Roosevelt was the initiator of the British-American-Soviet tripartite conference, the initiator of the Cairo, Tehran, and Crimea conferences, and the mediator of the contradictions between the Soviet Union and Great Britain. After his death, the contradictions and oppositions between the anti-Axis countries will inevitably become acute due to the loss of the mediator, which will also be a blow to the Soviet Union. At the same time, Roosevelt was also the only person who could fairly restrain the Soviet Union. After his death, no one in the anti-Axis countries was able to make the Soviet Union yield. In the future, the Soviet Union's activities in Europe will be the main factor in promoting new conflicts between Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to the impact on the East Asian war situation, we cannot make an overestimation. However, Roosevelt was the promoter of the Greater East Asia War. As early as 1940-41, he had a plan to economically blockade Japan. Later, he forced and advocated the so-called ABCD anti-Japanese blockade line through diplomatic and military activities, forcing Japan to declare war on the United States for self-defense and self-preservation. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he has always been the proponent and implementer of launching a general counteroffensive against Japan and an offensive strategy against the Japanese mainland. Now that he is dead, the United States' strategy may have disagreements in command and tactics.</p>
<p>Now, the one who succeeded Roosevelt as the leader of the United States is a so-called "ordinary old man who rose from the darkness." Whether in politics, economics, or even diplomacy, his qualifications and strength are not comparable to Roosevelt. It is questionable whether he can shoulder the heavy responsibilities in the final stage of the internal and external difficulties. Standing in the position of the Greater East Asia participating countries, we feel that the weakening of the enemy camp naturally also benefits us, but we cannot be too optimistic and must be deeply vigilant and strive unremittingly.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Authorities' Statement: Japan-US War Will Continue</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency telegram) - Regarding the death of US President Roosevelt, the Japanese military authorities stated that the death of Roosevelt, the supreme commander of the US military, will undoubtedly greatly affect future US war guidance. However, to suddenly predict that the American will to fight will decline is a baseless fallacy. The gist of their statement is as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Roosevelt was the primary person responsible. Now that he has suddenly passed away, the ambition of the US imperialism he represents has not diminished in the slightest. The Japan-US war is unrelated to his life or death. Therefore, Japan's war against US imperialism will continue. Regarding Roosevelt personally being a great politician, we must admit this. Roosevelt's death has caused the United States to lose an important leader.</p>
<h3>New US President Truman Takes Office, Holds Meetings with Military and Political Officials</h3>

Special invitations have been extended to Chairman Zhou Fohai to personally conduct the inspection, as well as relevant officials and Allied authorities to attend. To mark the occasion, the Western Division held a grand pre-inspection yesterday morning (the 14th) at 9:00 AM at the Racecourse, presided over by Luo Junqiang, Chairman of the Municipal District Baojia Committee. The corps members marched with orderly steps and high spirits. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Pre-Inspection Circumstances</h3>
<p>The Baojia Self-Defense Corps Headquarters held a pre-inspection ceremony yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the Racecourse. Luo, Chairman of the Municipal District Baojia Committee, presided over the ceremony. Also present were Gu Gangwu, Secretary-General of the Corps Headquarters; Oukawa Rinpei, Secretary-General of the Corps Headquarters; the chiefs of the police sub-bureaus of each district; and all members of the Baojia Committee. Participating in the pre-inspection were 6,500 members from the Chu Chiawan, Zhabei, Huashan, Jiangwan, Putuo, Penglai, Jing'an, Taishan, Huangpu, Changshou, Xincheng, Xujiahui, Laozha, and Yiyuan districts, as well as trainees from the cadre training program. The pre-inspection began promptly. After the Commander-in-Chief, Xiao Gang Liu Bingquan, reported the numbers to Commander Luo, Chairman of the Committee, Luo was accompanied by Secretary-General Gu to conduct an inspection. After the inspection, a march-past was held. After the march-past, the entire corps gathered in front of the podium to listen to instructions. Secretary-General Gu delivered a speech first, followed by Chairman Luo. The ceremony concluded after an hour and a half.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Gu's Speech</h3>
<p>Gu Gangwu, Secretary-General of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps Headquarters, said in his speech, in essence: "Today's pre-inspection is honored by the personal inspection of the City Government Secretary-General and Chairman of the Municipal District Baojia Committee, as well as the enthusiastic participation of various chiefs, police sub-bureau chiefs, and chiefs of the joint defense. This demonstrates the deep importance attached to the city's self-defense corps members. All self-defense corps members were on duty last night and enthusiastically participated in the inspection this morning. This spirit is truly admirable and shows a deep understanding of their mission. As the old saying goes, 'Many hearts build a city wall.' Self-defense corps members are the strength of the masses, and we must continue to promote this strength. We hope that we will do our best to correct our shortcomings and strive to take on our responsibilities. We must arrive on time for tomorrow morning's official inspection."</p>
<h3>Chairman Luo's Address</h3>
<p>Luo, Chairman of the Municipal District Baojia Committee, said in his address, in essence: "This spring inspection of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps, with today's pre-inspection, fills me with energy and excitement. I feel optimistic and inspired about the future of the Baojia, the future of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps, the future of Shanghai's youth, and the future of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the Baojia in Shanghai, everyone had doubts about the Baojia organization. Now, the facts are before our eyes. Not only do we have a sound Baojia organization, but we also have self-defense corps members. All of you young comrades have received considerable military training. The doubts of the past have been completely dispelled today. I am confident that we can transform Shanghai and build Shanghai, and we can increase our confidence and courage. We can say that the spirit of transforming Shanghai and the spirit of building Shanghai is fully expressed in the Baojia system.</p>
<p>Today's pre-inspection shows that, objectively speaking, the spirit is high; however, there is still room for improvement in training, and the uniforms are not uniform. In the future, we should gradually reform. To achieve national unity, we must have unity of the people, unity of purpose, and then we can have a unified country. Since the Baojia Self-Defense Corps has military training, it must be unified in military affairs. In the future, we hope to have a rational plan, from formal unity to spiritual unity, from small aspects to large aspects, so that we can contribute to the nation and the people.</p>
<p>The time for our inspections is limited, and the purpose is to improve training. After this first inspection, I hope that you will all be more motivated, increase your courage, and enthusiastically participate in taking on more important tasks. This is the sincere expectation of the Baojia work comrades. I am confident that you will all have even more enthusiasm tomorrow, which is what I hope for."</p>
<h3>Director Li Reports on Police Bureau's Judicial Administration, Answers Various Questions at Press Conference</h3>

Li Shiyu, Director of the Third Division of the Police Bureau, attended to answer various questions. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Reform of the Third Division's Structure</h3>
<p>1. What is the recent progress of the Third Division's work? (Answer) The Third Division was originally the Judicial Division. The Police Bureau has now renamed it the Third Division as part of its organizational reform, but it still manages all judicial affairs, and there have been no changes in its business. In terms of organization, the original five sections and one office have been reduced to three sections and one office: the Crime Prevention Section, the Investigation Section, the Narcotics Investigation Section, and the Detention Center. In terms of personnel, adjustments have also been made. The original total of over 800 people has been reduced to 179 within the division and over 500 judicial police officers in various sub-bureaus. In terms of business, we strive for speed, accuracy, and simplicity to alleviate the suffering of the people and protect their rights. Previously, judicial cases from various sub-bureaus had to be sent to the General Affairs Office for collection and distribution before being transferred to the Third Division, which was cumbersome and time-consuming. This has now been improved, with the various sub-bureaus sending cases directly to the office of the Director of the Third Division. Furthermore, judicial cases were previously reviewed by the Investigation Section, but now they are reviewed directly by the Director's Office. After approval and stamping by the Director, the cases are returned to the sub-bureaus for transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution on the same day or, at the latest, the next morning. Similarly, cases for which assistance is requested by other agencies are handled with speed, completely eliminating unnecessary procedures. The Investigation Section specializes in handling cases detected and investigated by the bureau, as well as cases assigned by the Municipal Government or the concurrent Director. The Crime Prevention Section and the Identification Section have been merged because identification and crime prevention are closely related. This is another measure to simplify procedures and strengthen crime prevention efforts.</p>
<h3>Investigation Procedures for Confidential Cases</h3>
<p>2. What are the procedures for investigating cases and conducting confidential inquiries at your division and various sub-bureaus? Are there regulations regarding the number of days of detention? Are there uniform methods and ranges for handling bail cases, and how are special cases handled? (Answer) This bureau adheres to the Code of Criminal Procedure for the investigation of cases and confidential inquiries. Suspects are transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office within 24 hours whenever possible. Depending on the severity of the case, we request detention dates and assist prosecutors in investigating the case to ensure accuracy. As for bail procedures, we follow the law to allow bail for suspects whose maximum sentence is less than three years. However, some cases have special circumstances, such as repeat offenders of theft, who are not granted bail. We expedite the handling of the case and transfer it to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. For special cases involving collusion or hoarding for profiteering, endangering the Republic, etc., which require confidential inquiries by special tribunals, we report to the Director and then to the Mayor, in addition to cases assigned by the Mayor. If the Mayor deems the case important, it is reported to the Chairman of the National Government for approval before being transferred to a special tribunal for confidential handling.</p>
<h3>Handling of Corruption Cases</h3>
<p>3. There have been several cases of corruption in this city. How many cases have been transferred to the courts, and how many are still under investigation? (Answer) The authorities have been paying close attention to corruption cases and strictly investigating them. In addition to the two cases of municipal government officials stealing and selling coal and public property, which have been reported to Acting Chairman Chen for transfer to the Capital Special Tribunal for investigation and prosecution, and other cases that have been investigated and reported to the Mayor for verification, there are several other cases currently under confidential investigation. As for the details of the cases, it is not convenient to disclose them publicly.</p>
<h3>Countermeasures for Bizarre Murder Cases</h3>
<p>4. Recently, there have been many bizarre murder cases. What are the countermeasures, and what is the impact on crime prevention work? (Answer) The more complex the social environment, the more bizarre the crimes that occur. The countermeasures include vigorously promoting crime prevention work and improving mental health. As for newspaper reporting on these kinds of news, it should not be mere description of events, but rather distinguish right from wrong, explain the advantages and disadvantages, and rigorously criticize the occurrence of the case. The authorities should strictly handle the cases according to law, make clear examples, and deter others from doing the same. However, crime prevention work is only just beginning to be promoted and has not yet reached its full potential. We hope for the cooperation of all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Police Extortion in Remote Areas</h3>
<p>5. Your division has the determination to eliminate the extortion behavior of unscrupulous police officers, but how will you punish or remedy the extortion by patrol police and traffic police in remote roads? (Answer) Since Director Zhou concurrently took office, he has made the greatest determination to rectify police discipline. Police officers who violate the law will be severely punished. Director Zhou concurrently, in his capacity as Deputy President of the Executive Yuan, has spoken with judicial officials, emphasizing that corrupt officials must be severely punished according to law and should not be easily released on bail. Serious cases should be transferred to a special tribunal for investigation and prosecution. As for the extortion cases by police officers in remote areas, the Inspection Office will strengthen its inspection work and conduct spot checks to eliminate bad practices.</p>
<h3>Pork Retailers Suspend Business Yesterday</h3>
<p>Pork suddenly disappeared from this city's market yesterday. According to reporter investigations, this was due to pork retailers being limited by fixed prices and unwilling to purchase goods from wholesalers at high prices, leading them to suspend business collectively. It is reported that the Pork Retailers Association is not only reporting to the relevant authorities for immediate relief, but also advising its members to find ways to resume business.</p>
<h3>Price Evaluation Committee Held Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Price Evaluation Committee held its sixteenth committee meeting yesterday afternoon at the Economic Bureau. Committee members Xu Jiang, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Deyan, Yang Shi, Man Qiwei, Qin Tinggui, Yuan Ruichang, Liu Xingchen, Chen Guoquan, Luo Naqi, Liu Feng, Yang Heqing, and Tao Wenqi attended. Director of the Economic Bureau, Xu Jiang, presided over the meeting, which began with a report and discussion. The meeting concluded in the evening. It is reported that the meeting had very detailed discussions on the evaluation of over ten major commodities. As a result of the meeting, most of the evaluations have been notified, and a small number are still under consideration before a decision can be made. It is expected that the evaluations of over ten major commodities will be officially announced soon.</p>
<h3>Construction Bureau Merges and Adjusts Subsidiary Offices</h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau has received approval from the Municipal Government to merge and adjust the various subsidiary offices of the former Public Works Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau. The Nanshi Office of the former Public Works Bureau, the Nanshi Vehicle Registration Office of the Public Utilities Bureau, and the Nanshi Registration Office will be merged into the Nanshi Office, with four groups: General Affairs, Public Works, Affairs, and Shipping, to centralize the handling of business. The Beishi Office of the former Public Works Bureau and the Vehicle Registration Office and Ship Registration Office of the Public Utilities Bureau will be merged into the Beishi Office, with the same organization as the Nanshi Office. In Pudong, the Vehicle Registration Office of the Public Utilities Bureau and the office of the Public Works Bureau will be merged into the Pudong Office, and the original Xishi Vehicle Registration Office will be expanded into the Xishi Office. The existing offices in the city center will continue to operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Method of Conveying Alarms Using Gongs and Other Metal Sounding Instruments</h3>
<p>The Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters has stipulated that in the future, in addition to sounding alarm sirens, gongs and other metal sounding instruments will be used as auxiliary signals to convey air raid alarms. The methods of sounding the alarms are specified as follows:</p>
<p>Signal | Method of Sounding Gong, Rail, etc. | Remarks</p>
<p>------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Precautionary Alarm Issuance | Strike three times repeatedly | Simultaneously announce verbally</p>
<p>Air Raid Alarm Order | Strike continuously | Simultaneously announce verbally</p>
<p>Precautionary Alarm Cancellation | Strike two times repeatedly | Simultaneously announce verbally</p>
<p>To avoid confusion with the above signals, all gongs, bells, rails, and other metal sounding instruments must not be used in methods similar to those specified above.</p>
<h3>Economic Authorities Strictly Investigate the Trading of Enemy Currency</h3>
<p>The municipal economic authorities have observed the rampant establishment of [illegible] in this city recently, as well as suspected illegal trading of enemy currency. In order to stabilize the financial situation, prevent unexpected market fluctuations, and eliminate speculation, secret agents have been dispatched to investigate.</p>
<h3>A Few Enemy Aircraft Attacked the Shanghai Area Three Times Yesterday Morning, Dropping Several Bombs Without Causing Damage on the Ground</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Army Press Office announced at 6:00 AM on the 14th: From 0:10 AM on the 14th, a few enemy aircraft attacked the Shanghai area three times in waves, dropping several bombs. A small civilian ship caught fire, which was extinguished in about twenty minutes. There was no other damage on the ground.</p>
<h3>Municipal Construction Bureau Registers Well Owners</h3>
<p>The Municipal Construction Bureau notes that due to restrictions on the use of tap water, many residents have spontaneously drilled artesian wells for occasional use. However, most of these wells are drilled using unscientific methods, or the water quality is poor due to poor soil quality, which is detrimental to public health. In order to unify management and provide guidance, well owners are requested to register their wells. The Municipal Government has been requested to announce temporary registration procedures.</p>
<h3>Exemption from Business Tax for Candles</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government has approved the Ministry of Finance's consultation that, according to Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations on the Collection of Candle Tax (after the implementation of this tax, ordinary business tax will no longer be levied on candle merchants), since the candle and incense industries have already paid candle tax and [illegible] registration tax, the candle business tax should be exempted. The Finance Bureau has been instructed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Does Not Approve Tax Exemption for Oil Merchants</h3>
<p>Fifteen oil merchants in this city, including Shen Da, have submitted a request through their association to the Municipal Finance Bureau to reduce the business tax on credit oil, arguing that the market is currently depressed, profits are meager, and the statutory profit is less than 2%. It has been learned that the Finance Bureau has rejected the request.</p>
<h3>Report on Scholarship Donations</h3>
<p>Li Tai: 100,000 yuan. Anonymous (receipt #8695): 41,000 yuan. Anonymous (receipt #8694): 10,000 yuan. Total received: 151,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Captain Matsumoto Elucidates Recent War Situation, Construction Youth Team Holds Symposium</h3>
<p>The China Construction Youth Team held a current affairs symposium at 2:00 PM on the 15th on the third floor of the Nanjing Road (Sullivan) building. Representatives from various public organizations in this city attended, and Captain Matsumoto of the Japanese Fleet Press Office was invited to speak. In addition to Captain Matsumoto and the team's consultants and secretaries, public organizations such as the China Hongmen General Association, the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association, and the China Anti-Communist Alliance also sent representatives to attend. Captain Matsumoto spoke first, elucidating in detail the Pacific War situation, the war situation on the Chinese mainland, and the impact of US President Roosevelt's death on the world political situation. The representatives of various organizations then exchanged views on the current situation.</p>
<h3>Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Key points of Captain Matsumoto's speech: 1. The Okinawa Island strategy is like the Battle of Tsushima in the Russo-Japanese War, luring the enemy deep before launching a decisive attack. 2. The enemy's exaggerated propaganda claims that 1,400 ships are attacking Okinawa Island, but only over 600 are actually involved in the operation, including over 100 landing craft. After removing transport ships, only over 100 ships are participating in the battle on the front lines. In total, there are only over 300 ships around Okinawa, and the Japanese army has already inflicted heavy losses on them in recent days. 3. MacArthur's base warfare strategy requires considerable time and cannot achieve the goal of a quick victory. Nimitz's island-hopping strategy, taking advantage of weaknesses and advancing by leaps and bounds, assumes that securing sea and air control will overcome all challenges. However, it must be known that the islands of Palau and Rabaul are still in the hands of the Japanese army. Nimitz's strategy is due to the domestic situation in the United States. His strategy will encounter obstacles in the Battle of Okinawa, affecting the entire Pacific War situation.</p>
<h3>Mainland Operations</h3>
<p>1. The Chongqing forces concentrated their forces in an attempt to recapture Handan. The Japanese army repelled them with clever tactics, and then fought in Zhuozhou. 2. In the past, the US Air Force in Chongqing heavily bombed the [illegible] Han line. Their base was Laohokou. The Japanese army occupied this area in early April, and small-scale operations are still taking place in its [illegible] area. This will be resolved soon. 3. Laohokou used to be an important base for controlling Central China, North China, and the East Sea. Now, it has become a powerful base for the Japanese army's heavy units.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Death</h3>
<p>1. The US Vice President can only handle routine matters, and it is questionable whether he can cope with military production and various powerful figures. From an international perspective, it is also doubtful whether Truman can manipulate Churchill and Stalin. 2. Regarding the policy towards China, Roosevelt personally controlled the allocation of military supplies and loans in the past. It is questionable whether this can continue.</p>

<h3>Volunteer Education Committee Holds Regular Meeting, Resolving Many Important Cases; Continuing to Solicit Stationery, Hoping for Donations from All Sides</h3>

Each school has an average of one hundred students, meeting the required number. All ongoing matters are progressing smoothly. Yesterday, the Volunteer Education Committee held its second regular meeting, with all members in attendance, resolving many important cases, such as revising the service regulations for volunteer school teachers, increasing student enrollment at each school, adding classes, and hiring more teachers to ensure that impoverished children limited by the availability of spaces are not deprived of education. Regulations regarding teacher salaries and payment dates were also established.

It is hoped that enthusiastic members of the stationery industry will generously donate these items; their contribution would be greatly appreciated.

They also said that many elementary school students everywhere are responding with donations. Upon hearing this news, we all expressed enthusiastic support. We are children from the countryside. Being able to attend school ourselves is already very fortunate. Therefore, regardless of our limited abilities, we are voluntarily saving money on candy and have collected 5,340 yuan, which we are sending to your newspaper to be donated to the volunteer schools, to express our sentiments!"</p>
<p>Additionally, three elementary school students from Guangshi Girls' School donated 340 yuan and 19 used books, similarly expressing sympathy for the plight of their peers, their enthusiasm is commendable.</p>
