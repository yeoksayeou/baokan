<h3 id="c1">英總選舉工黨獲勝邱吉爾內閣辭職　阿特里奉命組織新內閣 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電據偷敦急電：截至目前爲止，英國工黨已以三分之二票之多數，得英國下院大部人員之擁護而獲勝利。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電據此間接獲消息：邱吉爾於昨夜晋謁英皇辭去首相之職，勞工黨領袖阿特里已正式奉命組織新內閣。邱吉爾以總選舉結果失敗，於昨夜一而卸去首相重任，一面發表一吿別咨文，略謂：「我欲向全國民衆表示者，即我內心無限之感激，我感激全英民衆在昔日最危險艱難之階段拜受重命時，予我以牢同之支撑，賜我以極大之信心。」</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電此問官方對於英總選舉結果，勞工黨佔絕對優勝，所抱見解如次：勞工黨之勝利，即係英國民傾向於戰後經營之證明。勞工黨新內閣之施政，或將注重於國內問題，但觀測英新內閣之對戰爭政策，當與保守黨政府相同，或較保守黨內閣更趨强硬。如果勞工黨於推進國內之戰後經營時，一方面繼續熱心於對日戰爭，則其政策恐將露破綻，新內閣之外交政策，此點於已往之美英關係，必發生相當之影響也。</p>
<h3 id="c2">英工黨幹部會議阿特里闡述政策 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電倫敦電：阿特里以次勞工黨領袖，於二十六日夜舉行緊急幹部會議，討論組織新內閣問題，該會議似亦會檢討波次坦會議之對策。勞動黨內閣之外相一職，當以前勞工部大臣貝頗·前商務部大臣達動頓·及前國務部大臣莫立遜等呼聲頗高。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電英國組織後繼內閣之阿特里，於勞工黨幹部會議席上對黨員講演新內閣之政策如次：「吾人必須正視英國必須進行最艱鉅事業，且必須克服當前各種困難之問題。勞工黨之政策，即爲「大國際主義」，吾人必須具有永么驅逐戰爭之完全保陣，並貢獻於世界繁榮，此種國際大業，實極鴛艱鉅，吾人必須恢復所受戰禍之損害，再建築已荒度之住宅，進而更復力謀英國民之生活水準向上，此即民主主義之事業，亦即正義之社會的事業」。</p>
<h3 id="c3">邱吉爾失敗　前因後果　顯示民心厭戰 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>中央社訊據此間國際評論家談：英國總選舉榮冠卒爲工黨所　，邱吉爾內閣被迫提出總辭職矣。查邱吉爾於一九四〇年五月出任閣撲，六年以來操縱戰時英國之政治軍事，手腕老　，滿以爲本屆選舉，勝券可操，奚知受英國冷酷無情「選舉」之審判，結果不得不吿下野。依據立憲政治之當然步驟，由絕對多數黨之黨魁阿特里出任後繼內閣之首班，預料阿特里將基於工黨對日之主張，組織單獨內閣。邱吉爾爲何失敗乎？爲何以三七九對一八一票之大差慘敗乎？鴛何對德作戰獲勝之有功者，今於英國國民自身之「投梨」之前，竟被迫退出政界乎？其理由甚簡單，蓋英國民現在已不願意戰爭之表現耳。今若仍由邱吉爾任首相，英國民將受莫大之痛苦，　邱吉爾爲第二次世界大戰之主動人，若英美敗北，則戰爭犯罪之巨頭，無疑將非希特勒貝當而爲邱吉爾，渠以巧妙之謀略，拖美國加入戰爭遂行對德作戰，故若今渠留任，英國對戰爭之負担將莫能緩和。　邱吉爾式之硬幹政戰兩略，於與德國交戰倫敦被炸之時，固有效力，今歐洲已見和平，英國民當然希望生活之優裕。　國內對於邱吉爾之帝國主義侵略戰，已發生懷疑，羣加批評，蔚爲一種興論。　英全國希望戰後之生活安定，乃陳護工黨之國內政策。　國民希望放棄邱吉爾之硬幹政策，防止對日作戰之犧牲，　擬推戴阿特里爲首相，强化英蘇接近，藉保歐洲之優越的旣得權，總而言之，凡此一方面表示英國民對邱吉爾之不信任，同時亦爲厭戰情緒之充分表　。</p>
<h3 id="c4">工黨施政綱領 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>本年五月二十二日工黨舉行黨大會時，曾通過「五年計劃黨綱領」，其內容爲　銀行及余融之統制，　改國內運輸製鐵鍊鋼各業公有公營，　强化獨佔事業並卡托兒之監督，　適當維持經濟及物價統制。至於對蘇政策，則驟明爲防止第三次世界大戰之發生，並除去現今彼此間誤解，實有部强英蘇國交之必要。同時又非正式宣稱，爲打開今後之時局，聯立內閣已非適要。惟有實現具有統一意志及絕對調和之單獨內閣，方能負收拾時局之重任云云。由此以觀，今後之工黨內閣與保守黨內閣自有截然不同之點，關於印度問題，當工黨舉行黨大會之時，當時之勞工大臣貝文曾就印度統治問題宣稱，一現內閣之政策多謬誤之處，印度事務大臣之職位，宜即予以廢止」。故邱吉爾於五月廿二日即聲明與工黨妥協事屬不可能，並以挑戰性質之公函致阿德里，函中有云，「足下反對在對日作戰之前，維持聯立內閣及暫緩舉行選舉，孰是孰非，將由全國國民審判，足下一再發表中傷保守黨之言辭，實出余意料之外，此於英國　政史上誠鴛扼腕之事，總選舉將於數月內舉行，足下言論殊足釀成阻得行政能率之惡果，此種責任應由工黨完全負之。」邱吉爾內閣於五月二十三日提出總辭職，奉英王命再度組閣，遂與工黨正式分袂，函首副首相阿特里·二千萬英國戰時人員獨裁者貝文勞工大臣·內務大臣摩里森同時辭職，邱吉爾遂組成保守然臨時內閣，以待總選舉之開票。</p>
<h3 id="c5">英國民冷酷性 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>保守黨爲對抗工黨之綱領，亦發表確保和平方策十二條，大要鴛「支持邱吉爾對日戰爭勝利後，當與美蘇兩國共同決定永久和平之大計，確保世界和平，　求英國全民福利，增進英國對外貿易，提高國民生活水準」等，然內容空洞，並無具體建議，對於國民實難有效。邱吉爾於三頭會議之際曾稱，「英國之總選舉對會議毫無影響，保守黨若失敗，工黨　阿特里將代余掌政。」故波次坦之會，阿特里相與偕行，蓋自知此番爲自已政治生命之歧路。會談期間突於二十五日歸選倫敦，而聞自己之敗訊，英國民對於七十一歲老人邱吉爾之判決亦太慘酷矣。</p>
<p>我人遙想邱吉爾之敗北孤影，不禁爲英國民之冷酷性大吃一驚，邱吉爾發揮硬幹政治手腕，由一九四一年八月大西洋會議以迄本年二月之亞歷山大會議，前後與故羅福會談達十一次之多，三次在府·二次在魁北克·德黑蘭（第一次）開羅·卡薩倫卡·雅爾達·德黑蘭（第二次）。邱吉爾以風燭之年，　走世界各地，發揮智　，使英國不入歧途，並抑制關民之動搖，以打倒德意志爲第一義，其功實不愧受「英國救世者」之尊稱。</p>
<p>邱吉爾一日吸雪茄三十枝，威士忌三瓶，生活力奇强，稱之爲英國「國寶」可也，然英國民一旦無此需要，即棄之如敝　，國民性之殘忍可見一斑。然在同時，又可窺見英國民非捨棄偉大指導者邱吉爾不可之「厭戰」情緒之如何澎湃與高昂。</p>
<h3 id="c6">傳統政策不變 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>以邱吉爾之實力及聲望，尚不能戰勝國民厭戰之情緒，工黨遂利用國民此種情緒，揭　國內安定政策，獲國民之支特而得勝。雖然邱吉爾之退位，與對日作戰毫無關係，蓋日本不以邱吉爾爲敵，而與項國作戰。且英國之任何內閣，關於對外政策一貫不變，此爲其傳統。今後之英國代邱吉爾起之阿特里，將作如何方向之指導，固有待歷史之證明。</p>
<h3 id="c7">邱吉爾將退出　政治舞台 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>從事著述戰史</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電此次英總選舉結果，保守黨失敗，是以邱吉爾似將於八月一日新議會成立後辭去下院議員之職務，而退出政界，從事埋頭著述「大戰史」。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c8">邱吉爾不台的面面觀 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>英國總選舉於二十六日揭虎，工黨以三七九票對保守黨一八一票，取得勝利。而特別値得注意的是，除了邱吉爾之外，所有邱吉爾政府裏的保守黨要人，沒有一個不在這次選舉中失敗。這是保守黨有史以來第一次犬失敗了。</p>
<p>邱吉爾所領導的保守黨，在這次總選舉中全面失敗了。邱吉爾領導的政府，也因此就立刻總辭職了！這是英帝國又一歷史悲劇的演出！這一歷史的悲劇，是英國人民向全世界公開宣示：</p>
<p>拒絕保守黨繼續帝國主義的戰爭政策，反抗戰爭結束後繼續推行帝國主義的政策。　英國人民對於戰爭的一種新的態度，他們已不再要戰爭了，他們求和平。</p>
<p>要求保障戰後人民和平與自由生活，保障最大多數人的經濟生活，和解决糧食、金融、物價及復　興建設諸問題。</p>
<p>在國際政策上希望逃避在邱吉爾保守黨政策下第三次大戰的危險傾向，進而希望促進對美國和蘇聯的合作。</p>
<p>要求合理解决殖民地問題和遠東權午問題。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以說，這次總選舉，是英國民意最有力的表現，是英國政治在窮途末路中找求新生曙光的表現。是英國及其各屬領殖民地向新生邁進的第一步。</p>
<p>但是，這一次是英國人民的意旨的表現，而京旨的表現，並不就等於事實！當前的問題是，以阿德里爲首的工黨新政權將領導英國向何處去？</p>
<p>工黨政府在現代英國史上這次已算第三次出現了，過去二次在麥唐納等領導下，雖無重大錯誤，但也無特殊功績可言。今阿德里能否有所大的作爲？我們今日尚未敢預測。但就阿德里等在邱吉爾聯合內閣時代的爲帝國主義政策辯護等等看來，也未必一定會比邱吉爾的保守黨政府高明到多少。但是，有一點必須注意，就是復興建設上可能更切實些，而在外交上則可以和蘇聯更接近些，而英美間的矛盾至少不會向「羅邱合作」時代逆轉。</p>
<p>邱吉爾的下台和工黨政權的出現，對於正在舉行中的三頭會議，當然會有相當影響。因此，關於特魯曼邱吉爾預謀中的逼迫史氏參加東亞戰爭一節，顯然要發生不同於預定的結論了。</p>

<p>揚州起初予記者的印象並不好，但盤桓了幾天後，倒覺得這古老的揚城亦有可愛之處。例如此間的街道，除了獨一無二的新馬路與幾條所謂繁華所在的大街，如多子街轅門橋左衛街敎塲街外，其餘十九都是狹長的深弄小巷，靜情悄的星佈在每個角落，仍保持着十八世紀的木來面目。至於此問的居民神情，又是那樣的閒逸，聰聽戲上上茶館，或者是知友三五，遠戚折隣，空時在家义义麻將，無怪揚州大舞台及素著盛名的富春花局，每天主　總是滿坑滿谷呢！</p>
<h3 id="c16">縣政概况 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>記者留揭期間，曾往江都縣政府訪問，茲將目江都縣全縣計分九區，按即城區，瓜洲，李典，仙女廟，大橋，宜陵，邵伯，大儀，黃玨橋，城區則又分廿九鄉。</p>
<p>以上九區之人口：　城區計有十三萬一千一百五十一人，　瓜州區爲十五萬八千七百七十八人，　李典區三千〇五十七人，　仙女廟區六萬六千八百六十七入，　大橋區（係匪區無統計，）　宜陵區二萬六千七百七十五人，　邵伯區二萬三千九百八十七人，　大儀區二萬九千六百五十六人，　黃玨墧區二萬八千八百九十五人，以上九區（按此統計係政令所及和平區之居民諭）人口總數則爲四十六萬九千一百六十六人。</p>
<h3 id="c17">政令難行 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>目前江都縣之縣政，因環境關係，推進上至感困難，與蘇北各地相同。現除第五區完全不能推進外，其他各區亦然，如三區李典，亦僅有所屬永茂興港兩鄉爲政令所及處。六區宣陵亦祇有木鎭及附鎭一二。七區邵伯約有四五鄉鎭。八區大儀則祗有甘泉·楊　·兩鄉。九區黃玨橋區，除附城之五鄉外，（黃金槐子瓦密司思廟淮四）餘皆爲匪區，故僅四區仙女廟與夫二區瓜洲，僅所屬之悅來，新集兩鄉不能推進除外，較爲稍强人意。綜觀上述，吾人可窺江都縣屬行政之困難，及治安不穩之一斑。</p>
<h3 id="c18">田賦情形 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>江都縣全縣之田畝總數約二，三一〇，二九三畝，田賦率計分三等九則，即一等上則田每畝微米一斗，一等中則八升六合五，一等下則田六升四合五。</p>
<p>二等上則　每畝計微米五升四合四，二等中則田三升七合七，二等下則田三升二合一。</p>
<p>三等上則田每畝計微米二升六合九，中則二升○三勺，下則計一升四合四。</p>
<p>過去在卅二年度時，計能微得田賦之畝數，爲五十一萬畝。最近因所轄八九兩區不能推進後，現祇餘四十萬畝。但即照此數，實際上亦祇僅能收得六成左右。按該縣卅二年度時，曾共徵得田賦稅金計九百餘萬元，其卅三年度者，自當年十一月一日開始，迄今尚未結束，計巳徵得白米八千六百餘担。</p>
<p>至縣府前與省府對田賦稅收之分配辦法，在卅年度以前，皆爲解省百分之三八·六二，縣存百分之六一·三八，後由卅一年度起，以迄綏署成立前，則通改省縣各半。</p>
<p>最近對田賦所得之實物處置辦法，已由蘇北綏靖公署，定有「田賦實物儲存變値暫行辦法」，乃係事前縣府須取得當地米業公會之「估單」（按即估價單）及稱樣，呈請綏署核准後，始得變賣折成現金，存入縣庫，再作各種經費之撥用。</p>
<h3 id="c19">農俗田制 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>呆包與聽分江都縣之農俗，農民與地主之關係約分兩種，一爲「呆包」，二爲「聽分」，前者係農民（佃戶）向業主承種，事前須定有「佃領」，（按即係佃契）契內對農作物將來之分配，有預定多少之辦漢，係雙方合定。</p>
<p>至後者「聽分」則佃農與地主間並無如「呆包」之書面契約，僅將來視年成豐歉爲定，慣例則按農作物收獲之總數，業主得三分之一，餘歸佃戶。</p>
<p>上下脚所謂「上下脚」者，「上脚」则指取得永佃權之佃戶與地主間之關係，「下脚」者即種戶由佃戶處取得耕地權後，又與第四者所發生彼此之關彼。</p>
<p>軍田在過去有淸一代江都等處有所謂軍田者，又名「衛田」，乃軍人有功者，由皇家賜與田畝，其錢糧不歸縣府收取，而歸特置之衛官徵入，民國後此種田畝已改爲民田矣。</p>

<p>南方前綫基地二十七日中央社電峇厘巴板戰綫，二十五日起復呈膠着狀態，目下僅有斥堠偵察，敵遭受日守備部隊堅强阻止，然焦於奪取油田地帶，故對三馬林達油廠及三加油田地帶，進攻頗積極。由峇厘巴板東地區僅三支路通行，其方向蔽於密林地帶，日軍據守該方面公路之進出口，不容敵人侵入。又敵於數週前開始使用機塲，巨人型快高率飛機開始活動。又峇厘巴板東雙方展開熾烈之拉鋸戰，於此戰况下，日軍奮勇作戰，野牛大尉所率之一隊，於敵彈雨之下担任修築公路之困難工作，日單衝鋒隊奇襲敵幹部所在陣地，將其炸毀，歸途中更與敵兵三十名交戰。松永兵曹·洲野戶兵長壯烈陣亡，西山兵長負重傷，切斷敵電話綫數十處後歸返。該方面日航空部長，於二十四日按間　動次强襲敵陣，加以轟炸，航空隊之活躍，日軍地上陣地亦能望見，故士氣更形昂揚。</p>
<p>西南太平洋基地二十七日中日社電二十三·四兩日，峇厘巴板囚敵開始新攻勢，故日美兩軍間激戰復起，然日軍出以熾烈迎擊，致美軍攻勢一時停頓。二十四日夜間，山遠方可望見日航空隊轟作敵陣數次，因之日軍士氣極爲旺　，然美軍尚以飛機不斷對日陣地繼續加以攻擊。</p>

<p>本市警　局副局長渡正監，於昨（廿七日）晟十時半出席市宣傳處主持之記者例會，報吿　局最近施政槪况，並答覆各報社記者提詢問題　詳。茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>淘汰冗員改善待遇</p>
<p>全市　政一元化後，即本旣定方針努力推進，如　淘汰冗員。過去警局共有警察一萬五千名業經縝　甄別，實行淘汰冗員，此事上月底已吿　事。　提高待遇。警察待遇本極菲薄，而少數警察竟利用職權，藉端勒索，故特將員警待遇提高至高峯，一面訓誠所屬，嚴禁有不端行為，如有故違，定予嚴峻處罰。　物資配給，自周兼局長任後，除設法改善員警待遇，曾加俸新外，並予以物資配給。　成立警察福利社，辦理員警福利事宜，目前主要配給除食米外，並有麵粉，火柴，捲烟，食油等日用品，食米配給數量分已婚有子女者按月六斗，未婚者月給二斗半。最近又承關係當局協助，將有食米二千噸完全配給員警，並聞該社不久將赴外埠採辦木柴來滬給員警。</p>
<p>救護隊伍嚴格訓練</p>
<p>空　時警局方面除警察與保甲密切聯繫外，對消防防空工作，積極進行，如本市警察總隊第四（白俄）隊之工作能力，深為社會各方所注意。該隊全體白俄隊員共二百名，計分六班，過去已受嚴格之訓練，故在空襲時，如遇有房屋倒坍等事發生，即出動救護，警局對該隊之設備，耗資頗巨，其組織純為軍事化，此次敵機頻襲滬市，該隊之活動工作尙稱滿意。此外警察總隊並設有預備隊，由華籍警士担任，刻正計劃予以同樣之訓練，期在非常緊急時聯含出動。</p>
<p>縣區防空將予强化</p>
<p>最近敵機頻襲本市，各縣效區救護設備簡陋，致受傷市民備受痛苦，深望警察當局加以注視設法强化（答）關於縣郊區防空救護等設備，據聞市府正積極考慮中，而市民防空本部亦已加以注意，擬予加强設備。本人曾於五月中旬因公返國，在東京時目睹該地防空救濟工作之組織元備，動作敏捷，遇有空襲受傷，即加以急救治療，對流離失所之國民，則立即予以給養救濟，悉由警察担任，故上海方面亟應急起倣照。本市咨詢委員會會擬以一部份的款充作空襲被災難民之用，據聞明（二十八）日下午四時將召開會議，商討分配辦法。至於醫院如對因空襲而受傷之平民，拒絕治療，警局決予以根除，保甲方面，亦進行編組救護隊，負責護治療受傷平民。同時並將遍及郊區。</p>

<p>昨天本報社會服務處代收空　救　捐款中，有羅秘書長轉來江蘇省政府曁蘇州民間工商界經募捐款，共六千三百餘萬元，遠道　　，殊為欽佩。</p>
<p>我們收到蘇省各界的捐款以後，立時感覺同住在上海的有錢人士，　心反不如遠道友人，我們開始收款已經八天，統計捐款數目，最普遍的在十萬元以下者，由此可見　心公益的遠是偏於無產階層。除了極少數的有錢人士慨捐鉅款以外，一般富商巨買都是吝嗇成性，不肯稍動善念。</p>
<p>任何人都知道，目前上海的鉅富，財產在百萬萬以上者，誠如汗牛充棟，如果能動一念之善，以千分之一救人苦難，那末，鉅最立時可集。這次估計空　救災經費，至少需要二十萬萬元，則非賴較大數目的捐款，恐不易集成。我們竭誠希望富商巨稍開方便之門，捐輸若干。</p>

<h3 id="e1">British General Election: Labour Party Wins, Churchill Cabinet Resigns, Attlee Commissioned to Form New Cabinet <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): According to a dispatch from London, the Labour Party has won the British general election with a two-thirds majority, gaining the support of most members of the British House of Commons.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): According to information received here, Churchill visited the King last night to resign as Prime Minister, and Labour Party leader Attlee has been formally commissioned to form a new cabinet. Churchill, due to the failure in the general election, resigned as Prime Minister last night and issued a farewell message, stating: "I wish to express to the people of the whole country my infinite gratitude. I am grateful to the British people for giving me firm support and great confidence when I was entrusted with a heavy responsibility during the most dangerous and difficult stage in the past."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): The official view here on the results of the British general election, in which the Labour Party holds an absolute advantage, is as follows: The victory of the Labour Party is proof that the British people are inclined towards post-war management. The policies of the new Labour Party cabinet may focus on domestic issues, but it is predicted that the new British cabinet's war policy will be the same as that of the Conservative government, or even more forceful than the Conservative cabinet. If the Labour Party continues to be enthusiastic about the war against Japan while promoting domestic post-war management, its policy may be flawed. This aspect of the new cabinet's foreign policy will inevitably have a considerable impact on the past US-British relations.</p>
<h3 id="e2">British Labour Party Executive Meeting: Attlee Elucidates Policies <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): London telegram: Attlee and other Labour Party leaders held an emergency executive meeting on the night of the 26th to discuss the formation of a new cabinet. The meeting also seemed to have reviewed countermeasures for the Potsdam Conference. The Labour Party cabinet's Foreign Minister post is highly likely to be filled by former Minister of Labour Bevin, former Minister of Commerce Dalton, and former Minister of State Morrison.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): Attlee, who is organizing the succeeding cabinet in Britain, gave a speech to party members at the Labour Party executive meeting outlining the new cabinet's policies as follows: "We must face the fact that Britain must undertake the most difficult tasks and overcome the various current difficulties. The Labour Party's policy is 'great internationalism.' We must have a complete guarantee of permanently eradicating war and contribute to world prosperity. This international undertaking is extremely difficult. We must restore the damage caused by the war, rebuild the abandoned houses, and further strive to improve the living standards of the British people. This is the cause of democracy, and it is also the cause of a just society."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Churchill's Defeat: Causes and Consequences Show the People's Anti-War Sentiment <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: According to international commentators here, the crown of the British general election ultimately went to the Labour Party, and Churchill's cabinet was forced to submit its resignation en masse. Churchill took office as Prime Minister in May 1940 and has been manipulating Britain's political and military affairs during the war for six years. He fully believed that he could win the election, but unexpectedly received a cold and ruthless "election" judgment from the British people, and had to announce his resignation. According to the natural steps of constitutional politics, Attlee, the leader of the absolute majority party, will take over as the head of the succeeding cabinet. It is expected that Attlee will form a single-party cabinet based on the Labour Party's position on Japan. Why did Churchill fail? Why did he suffer a crushing defeat with a large margin of 379 to 181 votes? Why was a meritorious person who won the war against Germany forced to withdraw from politics before the British people's own "vote"? The reason is very simple: the British people now no longer want the appearance of war. If Churchill were still the Prime Minister, the British people would suffer great pain. Churchill was the initiator of World War II. If Britain and the United States had been defeated, the major war criminal would undoubtedly be Churchill, not Hitler or Pétain. He used clever strategies to drag the United States into the war and carry out the war against Germany, so if he remained in office, Britain's burden of the war would not be eased. Churchill's hard-line political and war strategies were effective when London was bombed during the war with Germany, but now that Europe has seen peace, the British people naturally hope for a good life. Domestically, doubts and criticisms have arisen about Churchill's imperialist war of aggression, forming a kind of public opinion. The whole of Britain hopes for a stable life after the war, and thus supports the Labour Party's domestic policy. The people hope to abandon Churchill's hard-line policies and prevent sacrifices in the war against Japan, and intend to support Attlee as Prime Minister, strengthen British-Soviet rapprochement, and protect Europe's superior vested rights. In short, all of this shows the British people's distrust of Churchill and is also a full expression of anti-war sentiment.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Labour Party Policy Program <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>When the Labour Party held its party congress on May 22 of this year, it passed the "Five-Year Plan Party Program," which included: 1. Control of banks and finance. 2. Reforming domestic transportation, iron and steel industries into public ownership. 3. Strengthening the supervision of monopoly businesses and cartels. 4. Appropriately maintaining economic and price controls. As for the policy towards the Soviet Union, it was clearly stated that in order to prevent the occurrence of a third world war and remove current misunderstandings between each other, it is necessary to strengthen British-Soviet relations. At the same time, it was informally declared that, in order to open up the current situation, a coalition cabinet is no longer appropriate. Only by realizing a single-party cabinet with a unified will and absolute harmony can the heavy responsibility of dealing with the current situation be shouldered. From this, it can be seen that the future Labour Party cabinet and the Conservative Party cabinet will have distinctly different points. Regarding the Indian question, when the Labour Party held its party congress, the then Labour Minister Bevin stated on the Indian governance issue, "The current cabinet's policies have many errors, and the position of Minister of Indian Affairs should be abolished immediately." Therefore, Churchill declared on May 22 that compromise with the Labour Party was impossible and sent a public letter with a challenging nature to Attlee, which stated, "Whether you oppose maintaining the coalition cabinet and postponing the election before the war against Japan is right or wrong will be judged by the people of the whole country. Your repeated defamatory remarks against the Conservative Party are beyond my expectations and are truly regrettable in British political history. The general election will be held in a few months, and your remarks are very likely to lead to the adverse consequences of obstructing administrative efficiency. This responsibility should be fully borne by the Labour Party." Churchill's cabinet submitted its resignation en masse on May 23, and he was ordered by the King to form a cabinet again, thus formally parting ways with the Labour Party. Vice-Prime Minister Attlee, the dictator of 20 million British wartime personnel, Labour Minister Bevin, and Home Secretary Morrison resigned at the same time. Churchill then formed a conservative temporary cabinet to await the opening of the general election.</p>
<h3 id="e5">British People's Cold-Blooded Nature <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>In order to counter the Labour Party's program, the Conservative Party also issued twelve articles to ensure a peaceful strategy, mainly: "Supporting Churchill's victory in the war against Japan, and then jointly deciding on a plan for permanent peace with the United States and the Soviet Union to ensure world peace. 2. Seeking the welfare of all British people. 3. Increasing British foreign trade. 4. Raising the living standards of the people," etc., but the content was empty and there were no concrete suggestions, making it difficult to be effective for the people. Churchill said during the Three-Headed Conference, "The British general election has no influence on the conference. If the Conservative Party fails, Attlee will take over from me." Therefore, Attlee accompanied him to the Potsdam Conference, knowing that this time was the crossroads of his own political life. During the talks, he suddenly returned to London for the election on the 25th and heard the news of his own defeat. The British people's judgment of the 71-year-old Churchill was too cruel.</p>
<p>We remotely imagine Churchill's lonely figure of defeat and cannot help but be shocked by the cold-blooded nature of the British people. Churchill exerted his hard-line political skills, from the Atlantic Conference in August 1941 to the Alexandria Conference in February of this year, holding talks with the late Roosevelt as many as eleven times, three times in his mansion, twice in Quebec, Tehran (first time), Cairo, Casablanca, Yalta, and Tehran (second time). Churchill, in his waning years, traveled all over the world, exerting his wisdom to prevent Britain from going astray and suppress the wavering of the people, with the defeat of Germany as the primary goal. His contribution truly deserves the honor of being called the "Savior of Britain."</p>
<p>Churchill smokes thirty cigars and drinks three bottles of whiskey a day, his vitality is extremely strong, and he can be called a British "national treasure." However, once the British people no longer need him, they discard him like worn-out shoes. The ruthlessness of the national character can be seen in this. At the same time, it can also be seen how surging and high the "anti-war" sentiment of the British people is, forcing them to abandon the great leader Churchill.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Traditional Policies Remain Unchanged <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>With Churchill's strength and prestige, he could not overcome the people's anti-war sentiment, so the Labour Party took advantage of this sentiment and advocated a domestic stability policy, gaining the support of the people and winning the victory. Although Churchill's retirement has nothing to do with the war against Japan, as Japan does not consider Churchill an enemy but is at war with Britain. Moreover, any British cabinet's foreign policy remains consistently unchanged, which is its tradition. It remains to be seen how Attlee, who is replacing Churchill in the future, will guide the country.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Churchill to Withdraw From Political Stage <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Engaging in Writing War History</p>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): As a result of this British general election, in which the Conservative Party failed, Churchill seems to be resigning from his position as a member of the House of Commons after the establishment of the new parliament on August 1 and withdrawing from the political arena to devote himself to writing "The History of the Great War."</p>

<h3 id="e8">A Multi-Faceted View of Churchill's Ouster <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The British general election was revealed on the 26th, with the Labour Party winning with 379 votes against the Conservative Party's 181 votes. What is particularly noteworthy is that, apart from Churchill, all the important Conservative Party figures in Churchill's government failed in this election. This is the first complete failure in the history of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>The Conservative Party led by Churchill suffered a comprehensive defeat in this general election. The government led by Churchill also resigned immediately because of this! This is another historical tragedy being staged in the British Empire! This historical tragedy is a public declaration by the British people to the world:</p>
<p>Rejecting the Conservative Party's continued imperialist war policies and resisting the continued implementation of imperialist policies after the end of the war. The British people have a new attitude towards war; they no longer want war; they seek peace.</p>
<p>Demanding the protection of the people's peaceful and free life after the war, guaranteeing the economic life of the largest number of people, and solving problems such as food, finance, prices, and reconstruction and construction.</p>
<p>Hoping to escape the dangerous tendency towards a third world war under Churchill's Conservative Party policies in international policy, and further hoping to promote cooperation with the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Demanding a reasonable resolution to colonial problems and Far Eastern power issues.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that this general election is the most powerful expression of British public opinion and the expression of British politics seeking a new dawn in a dead end. It is the first step towards a new life for Britain and its affiliated colonies.</p>
<p>However, this time it is the expression of the British people's will, and the expression of the will does not equal the fact! The current question is, where will the new Labour Party regime headed by Attlee lead Britain?</p>
<p>The Labour Party government has now appeared for the third time in modern British history. In the past, under the leadership of MacDonald and others, although there were no major errors, there were no special achievements to speak of. Can Attlee make any major achievements now? We dare not predict today. However, judging from Attlee's and others' defense of imperialist policies during the Churchill coalition cabinet era, they may not necessarily be much better than Churchill's Conservative Party government. However, one point must be noted, that is, it may be more realistic in reconstruction and construction, and it can be closer to the Soviet Union in diplomacy, and the contradiction between Britain and the United States will at least not reverse to the era of "Roosevelt-Churchill cooperation."</p>
<p>Churchill's resignation and the emergence of the Labour Party regime will of course have a considerable impact on the ongoing Three-Headed Conference. Therefore, with regard to the section on Truman-Churchill's conspiracy to force Stalin to participate in the East Asian war, it is obvious that a conclusion different from the planned one is about to occur.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): About sixty enemy B-29 aircraft infiltrated the vicinity of Omuta City via the Satsuma Peninsula at about 00:30 on the 27th, and for about an hour, they indiscriminately dropped incendiary bombs and bombs on the city and its surrounding areas, causing fires in various parts of Omuta City, but they were completely extinguished by about 4:00 AM. In addition, about forty B-29 aircraft, divided into two teams, carried out incendiary bomb attacks on Matsuyama and Tokuyama cities for two hours starting at 10:30 AM on the 26th. In addition, seven or eight other B-29 aircraft reconnoitered Yamaguchi Prefecture at the same time.</p>

<p>Southern Front Base, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): The Chongqing army under He Yingqin, which has been clamoring to attack Vietnam and continuing to stir up trouble, Japanese troops stationed in northern Vietnam have launched an attack since the 19th of this month, braving the rain. They first attacked the enemy's positions near Xiadong, becoming the vanguard of the main force of the 151st Division of the enemy's Second Front Army in Jingxi. Another unit attacked the Dongxing area, occupied it, and then broke through the Chongqing army's positions in the steep mountainous cave positions. Since the 23rd, they have destroyed and burned several military facilities and military supply accumulation points, and on the evening of the 24th, they infiltrated Nengzhou and Pingxiang with a unit, giving them a destructive blow, shattering the enemy's attempt to counterattack, and are currently expanding their war results.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): At noon on the 25th, 31 enemy P-51 aircraft invading Hong Kong dropped nine bombs on the enemy nationals' detention center in the Stanley area. As a result, several British people in the detention center suffered minor injuries. According to reports, the weather was clear that day, and the detention center was marked with signs. The enemy carried out bombing at a low altitude of 400-500 meters, which was obviously intentional. In addition, the detention center was also bombed by carrier-based aircraft on the 1st of this month, resulting in several deaths and injuries. The American aircraft's illegal actions have truly made the detained British people gnash their teeth in hatred.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency telegram): The British and American news reporting circles are keen to publicize that the main topic of the Three-Headed Conference is the East Asian issue, with the focus on the issue of Japan. According to a Reuters telegram from Potsdam on the 24th, the issue of the British, American, and Soviet war against Japan has been decided. Another Reuters telegram said that the American side believes that the Three-Headed Conference will have some important announcements regarding the war against Japan and emphasizes the Soviet Union's mission. This is a kind of propaganda strategy, intended to urge the Soviet Union to participate in the war against Japan, which is in sharp contrast to the current neutral countries' conservative silence on the issue.</p>

<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu is a grain-producing area. The people of Shanghai are often panicked about food. In the midst of advocating the consumption of mixed grains, the reporter went to Northern Jiangsu to investigate. On the first day of the month, I took the night train from Shanghai and arrived in Zhenjiang at 5:00 the next morning. What was surprising was that the inspection station, which had been ordered to be abolished by the central government, was still carrying out its work of harassing the people and extorting money. Afterwards, I talked to the villagers in the tea house next to the station about this matter. According to them, these people are currently using the excuse that they are in the process of winding down, so they continue to operate as before, and because they know that the good times will not last, they are taking the opportunity to get what they can, and they are even more greedy and ruthless than before, which makes the villagers sigh!</p>
<p>At 6:30, I arrived at the riverbank. By then, the place was already crowded with people. Someone was selling black market tickets for the ferry. Soon, the inspection began at the dock. The situation was comparable to that of a military station. Passengers here had to pay "road tax" as usual. At 8:00, the ship set sail. When it reached the middle of the river, the person in charge of the ship came to check the tickets, claiming that each passenger had to pay 500 yuan for "expenses," which was no different from a poll tax.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, after arriving at the opposite bank, I switched to a long-distance bus of the Central China Transportation Corps and drove directly to Yangzhou. Half an hour later, I arrived at the bus station outside the South Gate, crossed the floating bridge (consisting of several small wooden boats), passed through Fuyunmen and entered the city.</p>
<h3 id="e15">A Glimpse of Yangzhou <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>"With 100,000 yuan around one's waist, one rides a crane to Yangzhou," but history is cruel, and present-day Yangzhou is outdated and old. All it can give people is a taste of history.</p>
<p>Yangzhou did not make a good impression on the reporter at first, but after lingering for a few days, I felt that this ancient city also has its lovely side. For example, the streets here, apart from the unique Xinma Road and a few so-called prosperous streets, such as Duozi Street, Yuanmen Bridge, Zuowei Street, and Jiaochang Street, the other nineteen are long and narrow deep alleys, quietly scattered in every corner, still maintaining the original appearance of the 18th century. As for the residents here, they are so leisurely, listening to operas and going to teahouses, or with three or five friends or relatives, playing mahjong at home when they are free. No wonder the Yangzhou Grand Theatre and the famous Fuchun Flower Bureau are always packed every day!</p>
<h3 id="e16">County Government Overview <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>During my stay, I visited the Jiangdu County Government. The following is an overview of Jiangdu County, which is divided into nine districts: the urban area, Guazhou, Lidian, Xiannvmiao, Daqiao, Yiling, Shaobo, Dayi, and Huangjueqiao. The urban area is further divided into twenty-nine townships.</p>
<p>Population of the above nine districts: 1. The urban area has 131,151 people. 2. The Guazhou district has 158,778 people. 3. The Lidian district has 3,057 people. 4. The Xiannvmiao district has 66,867 people. 5. The Daqiao district (a bandit area, no statistics). 6. The Yiling district has 26,775 people. 7. The Shaobo district has 23,987 people. 8. The Dayi district has 29,656 people. 9. The Huangjueqiao district has 28,895 people. The total population of the above nine districts (note: these statistics are for residents in the peaceful areas where government orders can be enforced) is 469,166.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Difficult to Implement Government Orders <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the county government of Jiangdu County is experiencing difficulties in its promotion due to environmental reasons, which is the same as in other parts of Northern Jiangsu. At present, except for the fifth district, which is completely unable to be promoted, the same is true for the other districts. For example, in the third district of Lidian, only the two townships of Yongmao and Xinggang are subject to government orders. In the sixth district of Xuanling, there are only Muchen and one or two attached towns. In the seventh district of Shaobo, there are about four or five townships and towns. In the eighth district of Dayi, there are only Ganquan and Yangzhuang townships. In the ninth district of Huangjueqiao, in addition to the five townships attached to the city (Huangjin, Huaizi, Wamisisi, and Huai Si), the rest are bandit areas. Therefore, only the fourth district of Xiannvmiao and the second district of Guazhou, except for the two townships of Yuelai and Xinjie under their jurisdiction that cannot be promoted, are slightly stronger. Looking at the above, we can get a glimpse of the difficulty of the administration and the instability of public security in Jiangdu County.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Land Tax Situation <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The total number of cultivated acres in Jiangdu County is approximately 2,310,293 acres. The land tax rate is divided into three grades and nine categories, that is, the first-grade top-grade fields are taxed at 1.1 deciliters of rice per mu, the first-grade middle-grade fields at 8.65 deciliters, and the first-grade low-grade fields at 6.45 deciliters.</p>
<p>The second-grade top-grade fields are taxed at 5.44 deciliters of rice per mu, the second-grade middle-grade fields at 3.77 deciliters, and the second-grade low-grade fields at 3.21 deciliters.</p>
<p>The third-grade top-grade fields are taxed at 2.69 deciliters of rice per mu, the middle-grade fields at 2.03 deciliters, and the low-grade fields at 1.44 deciliters.</p>
<p>In 1943, the number of mu that could be levied was 510,000 mu. Recently, due to the inability to promote the eighth and ninth districts under its jurisdiction, there are now only 400,000 mu remaining. However, even with this number, only about 60% can actually be collected. According to reports, the county collected a total of more than 9 million yuan in land tax revenue in 1943. The revenue for 1944, which began on November 1 of that year, has not yet ended and has collected more than 8,600 dan of white rice.</p>
<p>As for the distribution method between the county government and the provincial government for land tax revenue, before 1941, 38.62% was handed over to the province and 61.38% was retained by the county. Later, from 1942 until the establishment of the Pacification Office, it was changed to 50% each for the province and the county.</p>
<p>Recently, the Suzhou Northern Pacification Headquarters has stipulated the "Interim Measures for the Storage and Monetization of Land Tax Commodities" for the disposal of land tax proceeds. The county government must first obtain a "valuation form" (that is, a valuation form) and a sample from the local rice industry association and submit them to the Pacification Headquarters for approval before they can be sold and converted into cash, which is then deposited into the county treasury for various expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Agrarian Customs and Land System <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Agricultural Customs in Jiangdu County: "Stupid Package" and "Listening to Shares." The relationship between farmers and landlords can be roughly divided into two types: "Stupid Package" and "Listening to Shares." The former refers to farmers (tenants) who lease land from owners and must determine a "lease" in advance (that is, a tenancy contract). The contract predetermines how the crops will be distributed in the future, agreed upon by both parties.</p>
<p>As for the latter, "Listening to Shares," there is no written contract between the tenant farmer and the landlord like in the "Stupid Package." The division is determined based on the abundance or scarcity of the harvest that year. Conventionally, the owner receives one-third of the total crop yield, and the remaining two-thirds go to the tenant.</p>
<p>Upper and Lower Feet: The term "Upper and Lower Feet" refers to the relationship between a tenant who has obtained perpetual tenancy rights ("Upper Foot") and the landlord. "Lower Foot" refers to the relationship that arises between the cultivator who has obtained the right to cultivate the land from the tenant and a fourth party.</p>
<p>Military Lands: In the past, during the Qing Dynasty, there were so-called military lands in Jiangdu and other places, also known as "Garrison Lands." These were fields bestowed by the imperial court to meritorious military personnel. The taxes on these lands were not collected by the county government but by specially appointed garrison officers. After the Republic of China, these lands were converted into civilian lands.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Southern Frontline Base, 27th: The Balikpapan front has returned to a stalemate since the 25th. Currently, only scouting is taking place. The enemy is facing strong resistance from the Japanese garrison forces. However, eager to seize the oilfields, they are actively attacking the Samarinda oil refinery and the three oilfield areas. Only three roads pass through the eastern district of Balikpapan, and their directions are obscured by dense forests. The Japanese army is defending the entrances and exits of the roads in this area, preventing the enemy from entering. Moreover, the enemy began using an airfield several weeks ago, and giant, high-altitude aircraft have started operating. Fierce seesaw battles have broken out between the two sides in eastern Balikpapan. In this situation, the Japanese army is fighting bravely. A team led by Captain Yano is undertaking the difficult task of building roads under enemy fire. A Japanese commando team raided the enemy's headquarters, destroying it. On their return, they engaged in battle with 30 enemy soldiers. Sergeant Matsunaga and Corporal Suge were killed in action, while Corporal Nishiyama was seriously wounded. They cut dozens of enemy telephone lines before returning. On the 24th, the Japanese Air Force commander in the area, Aida, launched a strong attack on the enemy's position, bombing it. The activity of the air force is visible to the Japanese ground forces, further boosting their morale.</p>
<p>Central Japan News Agency dispatch from Southwest Pacific Base, 27th: On the 23rd and 24th, the enemy besieging Balikpapan launched a new offensive, causing renewed fierce fighting between Japanese and American forces. However, the Japanese army launched a fierce counterattack, causing the American offensive to stall temporarily. On the night of the 24th, Japanese air force bombing of enemy positions could be seen several times from the mountains, greatly boosting the morale of the Japanese army. However, the American forces continue to attack Japanese positions with aircraft.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou, 27th: The Suzhou Central Reserve Inspection Office and the Provincial Police Bureau previously strictly prohibited illegal discounting and trading by various firms and the unwarranted refusal to pay cash for checks to steer provincial finances back on track. However, a few firms, driven by profit, have been outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, disrupting the financial market and stimulating price increases. Therefore, the Inspection Office and the Provincial Police Bureau will thoroughly investigate the cash revenue and expenditure accounts of various firms, strictly prohibit privately operated illegal discounting companies, and encourage the public to report violations to stabilize provincial finances.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 27th: The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Ministry of Industries and Commerce feels that the lack of technical personnel often hinders the effective promotion of local production increase efforts. Therefore, it has hired a large number of technical personnel and issued official letters to various provinces and cities, allowing them to directly request personnel from the Ministry. It is now known that the Huaihai Province, Anhui Province, and northern Jiangsu Province have responded to the Ministry, designating technical personnel to be dispatched to Xuzhou, Bengbu, Yangzhou, and other places to guide production increase efforts. The Ministry has dispatched specialists to reside and work in these locations.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Beiping, 27th: Before adjourning on the 21st, the National Political Council in Chongqing listed Sheng Shicai's acts of killing civilians and accepting bribes during his tenure as Chairman of Xinjiang Province and requested severe punishment in the name of the people. The motion passed unanimously, causing ripples in the delicate international political situation surrounding the Xinjiang issue. A United Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 21st stated that the measures taken by the National Political Council against Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Sheng Shicai were significant. Sheng had ruled Xinjiang Province autocratically for twelve years, during which he killed hundreds of civilians and accepted countless bribes. He was only transferred to the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry last August. At the same time as the impeachment by the National Political Council, a Mr. Lin, the director of construction in the province who had been arrested a year ago, also accused Sheng of his crimes. The Chongqing judicial authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation. Sheng, who was backed by the Soviet Union and ruled Xinjiang autocratically, was transferred to the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry about a year after leaving Xinjiang, and now he has been impeached. This plan is nothing more than a predetermined strategy by the Chongqing Kuomintang. At a time when external forces are vying politically for influence in Xinjiang, the sudden impeachment of Sheng, who still has considerable latent power in the Xinjiang border region, is...</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Hangzhou, 27th: Since the start of this year, highways in Zhejiang Province have been damaged by bandits and puppet troops, making them either completely impassable or difficult to travel. This obstruction of transportation has caused exceptional hardship for travelers. Since Governor Ding took office, he recognized the critical relationship between highways and security, economy, and transportation and planned to repair them. Recently, bids have been let or construction is underway for the Hangzhou-Fuyang Highway, the Hangzhou-Yuhang Highway, the Hangzhou-Jiashan Highway, and the Hangzhou-Wuxing Highway. The initial cost of constructing these highways is as high as 50 million yuan. Because the project concerns the prosperity of Zhejiang Province and local security, no expense will be spared in their construction. Other highways are being planned for construction by the relevant authorities. Furthermore, the original Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration has been reorganized into the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau. Governor Ding will serve concurrently as the director of the bureau, and Mao Yuyuan and Wu Renhao have been appointed as deputy directors. Management offices have been established for each major highway, with Xing Shaomei appointed as the director of the Hangzhou-Fuyang Highway Management Office, Shen Banmei as the director of the Hangzhou-Yuhang Highway Management Office, and Xi Jianping as the director of the Hangzhou-Jiashan Highway Management Office.</p>

<p>Central News Agency report citing a Xinhua News Agency broadcast: The magazine "Rebirth," originally the organ of the Chinese National Socialist Party, has been reorganized and become a common platform for various parties and factions in Chongqing. Recently, in its 100th commemorative issue, it published an article titled "All Democrats Unite," which stated: Currently, many people hope for genuine democracy. However, many groups, using democracy as a mask, attempt to enjoy privileges. We propose the following: National unity; Reduce the privileges of a small number of privileged groups; Give the people freedom of speech, association, assembly, and physical integrity; Realize genuine democracy.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 27th: The Chongqing government's strict control of news and communication has aroused dissatisfaction both domestically and abroad. According to a New York dispatch on the 25th, The New York Times, in an editorial on the 24th, discussed the Chongqing government's recent ban on two American journalists, Randall, from entering the country. The editorial argued that while an American journalist's exposure of the weaknesses and corruption of the Chongqing regime was harsh, Chiang Kai-shek should accept the criticism and reflect on himself for improvement if he sincerely intends to build a democratic China. American journalists criticizing Chiang Kai-shek is not that different than British journalists criticizing Churchill and American journalists criticizing Roosevelt. However, only free speech can promote truth. If Chiang Kai-shek attempts to suppress speech out of practical needs, it will only worsen the situation.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 27th: According to a London dispatch, The Sunday Times reported on the 22nd that a German scientist had invented a mustard gas fuel that could produce ultra-high temperatures when the European war was about to end. This gas could have a decisive impact on every tactic. It is called "Igol," and it is used to propel Y-type Meteor missiles. According to the inventor, it is predicted that using this fuel to launch naval torpedoes could control them from afar if they miss the target on their first pass, allowing them to move back and forth through the escort path of their target multiple times. The fuel can increase the speed of submarines by twenty nautical miles per hour, and if used in aircraft, the speed can be 650 miles per hour for one hour or 450 miles per hour for three hours. The inventor is now in the United Kingdom and has informed British scientists of the details.</p>

<p>Central News Agency report citing a TASS dispatch from Moscow: Harvesting began two months ago in the southern fields of the Soviet Union. Now, harvesting has also begun in the northern fields. Rice harvesting has already been completed in the Central Asian and Transcaucasian republics, but harvesting is about to begin in Belarus and the Volga region. Farmers are bringing millions of tons of grain to the granaries of Uzbekistan, Cuba, Ukraine, and the Caucasus. This harvest is being hailed as a victory harvest, an exceptionally abundant one. Compared to last year, the area under cultivation has increased by millions of hectares. Most of the machinery and tractor stations, which were severely damaged by the German army, have been repaired. Three thousand machinery and tractor stations have been restored in all liberated areas to assist with harvesting. This year, 60% of the national grain harvest will be cut by combine harvesters.</p>

<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday (the 27th), Du Zhengjian, Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, attended the regular press conference hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Office to report on the Bureau's recent policies and answer questions from various newspaper reporters in detail. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Eliminating Redundant Personnel and Improving Treatment</p>
<p>After the unification of municipal administration, efforts were made to promote fixed guidelines, such as eliminating redundant personnel. In the past, the police bureau had 15,000 police officers. After careful screening, redundant personnel were eliminated, which was completed at the end of last month. Improving treatment. Police salaries were meager, and some police officers took advantage of their positions to extort money. Therefore, the salaries of police officers were raised to a high point. At the same time, subordinates were educated and strictly prohibited from engaging in improper behavior. Those who deliberately violated the rules would be severely punished. Distribution of supplies. Since Director Zhou took office concurrently, in addition to improving the treatment of police officers and increasing their salaries, they have also been given supplies. Establishing a police welfare society to handle welfare matters for police officers. Currently, the main supplies distributed include rice, as well as daily necessities such as flour, matches, cigarettes, and cooking oil. The amount of rice distributed is six dou per month for married people with children and two and a half dou per month for unmarried people. Recently, with the assistance of relevant authorities, 2,000 tons of rice will be distributed to police officers. It is also reported that the society will soon go to other cities to purchase firewood for police officers.</p>

<p>During air raids, the police bureau, in addition to close cooperation between the police and baojia, actively carries out firefighting and air defense work. The work ability of the fourth (White Russian) team of the Municipal Police Corps is highly regarded by all sectors of society. The team has a total of 200 White Russian members, divided into six classes. They have received rigorous training in the past. Therefore, in the event of air raids, such as the collapse of houses, they will be dispatched to rescue people. The police bureau has spent a lot of money on the team's equipment. The organization is purely military. The team's activities during the frequent enemy air raids on Shanghai have been satisfactory. In addition, the police corps has a reserve team staffed by Chinese police officers. Plans are underway to give them the same training, so that they can be dispatched together in emergencies.</p>
<p>Air Defense in Counties Will Be Strengthened</p>
<p>Recently, enemy aircraft have frequently attacked the city. The rescue equipment in the counties is simple, causing injured citizens to suffer greatly. It is hoped that the police authorities will pay attention to this and find ways to strengthen it. (Answer) Regarding the air defense and rescue equipment in the counties, it is said that the municipal government is actively considering it, and the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters has also paid attention to it and plans to strengthen the equipment. I returned to the country on official business in mid-May. In Tokyo, I witnessed the well-organized and swift air defense and rescue work. In the event of an air raid, the injured were given first aid and treatment. The displaced citizens were immediately given food and relief, all handled by the police. Therefore, Shanghai should urgently emulate this. The Municipal Advisory Committee intends to use a portion of the funds for air raid victims. It is said that a meeting will be held tomorrow (the 28th) at 4:00 PM to discuss the distribution plan. As for hospitals refusing to treat civilians injured in air raids, the police bureau is determined to eradicate this. The baojia are also organizing rescue teams to be responsible for treating injured civilians. At the same time, this will be extended to the suburbs.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Police Bureau Revises Penalties for Major Land Traffic Violations, Orders Subordinate Branches to Implement <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly rectify traffic order and maintain the city's appearance, the Municipal Police Bureau, starting on the 25th of this month, cooperated with the military police and members of the Baojia Office Police Corps to implement "Strengthening Traffic Week." The bureau directed traffic, cracked down on vehicles and pedestrians violating regulations, and since its implementation, traffic order has been improving day by day. At the same time, the bureau has also revised the "Penalty Regulations for Major Land Traffic Violations," which has been implemented by all subordinate branches since the previous day. The reporter has learned the following details:</p>
<p>Fines Divided into Two Categories</p>
<p>According to the articles of the Land Traffic Management Regulations, fines are divided into first and second categories. Violations of Articles 5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 27, 28, 30 to 37, 39, 41, 45 to 47, 49 to 52, 54, 56, 59, 61 to 64, 66, 67, 70 to 75, 79 to 83, 86, 89 to 96 of the regulations are classified as the first category of fines. All other articles are classified as the second category of fines.</p>
<p>Penalties for Various Vehicle Violations</p>
<p>Automobiles or trucks or other motorized vehicles that violate the first category of fines shall be fined 20,000 to 50,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Motorcycles that violate the first category of fines shall be fined 15,000 to 40,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 40,000 to 80,000 yuan. Carts and horse-drawn wagons that violate the first category of fines shall be fined 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 20,000 to 50,000 yuan. Tricycles that violate the first category of fines shall be fined 5,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 10,000 yuan. Rickshaws that violate the first category of fines shall be fined 2,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 5,000 yuan. Bicycles, handcarts, and other similar vehicles are the same as rickshaws. The penalties for vendors are also the same as for rickshaws. Other violations of the first category of fines shall be fined 2,000 yuan, and those that violate the second category of fines shall be fined 5,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(Notes) Those without a license or without a passing inspection certificate shall be punished in the same way as those without a license. Article 86 of the Land Traffic Regulations, all those involved in "piling up goods" shall be punished according to the second category of fines, and the rest shall be punished according to the first category of fines. For fines levied on violations not listed in this table, the fine shall not be lower than the minimum amount listed in the table or exceed the maximum amount. For cases where there are special provisions for violations, the amount of the fine shall be punished in accordance with the special provisions.</p>
<p>Commendations and Awards for Directors of Four Branches</p>
<p>Director Zhou, who is also the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, in order to encourage his subordinates to work hard, has successively promoted general police officers who have performed well on weekdays. Recently, due to the commendable work of Shi Sijian, director of the Taishan branch, Yao Benyuan, director of the Changning Central branch, Li Guohua, director of the New City branch, and Yao Ruifeng, director of the Jing'an Temple branch, Shi Sijian and Yao Benyuan were each awarded one major merit, and Li Guohua and Yao Ruifeng were each promoted to first-class police officers as an incentive.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Chen Shilong Comes to Shanghai <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Jun, Minister of Industry and Commerce and Secretary-General of the Materials Control Review Committee, came to Shanghai from Nanjing the other day.</p>
<p>It is understood that Chen's visit is to discuss and instruct relevant parties in Shanghai on promoting wartime economic policies, strongly suppressing market prices, reorganizing various control agencies, strengthening materials review work, and improving the organization of industrial and commercial associations.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Institutional Issues of the Five Control Committees</p>
<p>The National Commercial Control Federation and the five control committees for rice, flour, oil, cotton, and daily necessities have been established for more than a year since their reorganization in July last year. A plan has long been discussed on strengthening the institutional issues of the various committees and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. According to reporters, this entire major case of control administration has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan and is still being studied and considered by the Materials Control Review Committee, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and other relevant authorities. It is heard that Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's visit to Shanghai this time may have a mission to liaise and negotiate on the issue of materials control administration.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Second Phase of Epidemic Prevention Injections Begins <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city, due to the arrival of summer and the rampant outbreak of cholera, organized a cholera inoculation team and provided free injections and issued certificates to protect the health of citizens. Now that the second injection has begun, a notice has been issued to all police officers and citizens to voluntarily receive the injection. Those who violate the regulations will be investigated.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Construction Bureau Merges Affiliated Institutions <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Construction Bureau has established offices in northern Shanghai, southwestern Shanghai, Pudong, and the city center to carry out construction work and has selected appropriate locations to set up vehicle and ship registration offices for citizens to apply. For pier management, it is divided into six areas for management to facilitate supervision and command. It is learned that in order to adapt to the current actual situation and save treasury expenditures, starting in August, the existing institutions will be tightened and readjusted. The results of the investigation are as follows: The South City Office will be abolished, and the public works in the area will be directly handled by the bureau. Vehicle affairs will be handled by the Changxing Road Vehicle Registration Office, and ship affairs will be handled by the South City Pier Management Office. The City Center Office will be abolished. The Wusong Pier Management Office and the Vehicle and Ship Registration Office will be transferred to the Baoshan County Government. The Gongping Road Vehicle Registration Office will be abolished, and its affairs will be handled by the Jiangning Central Vehicle Registration Office. The Affairs Group of the North Shanghai Office and the Road Maintenance Team of the Pudong Office will be abolished, and engineering matters will be handled directly by the bureau. The West Shanghai Office will be changed to the West Shanghai Vehicle Registration Office. The Central Section Pier Management Office of Suzhou Creek will be abolished, and its affairs will be taken over by the East and West Sections Pier Management Offices of Suzhou Creek. The asphalt crushing plant and the workers' technical night school will be closed. It is learned that the employees of various factories and parks will be streamlined as much as possible within a possible scope, and it is heard that the municipal government will give severance pay to all laid-off employees in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Bank and Money Exchange House Customer Deposits: Stipulated Withdrawal Periods, Earlier Check Clearing Time <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silver and Money Exchange Association, based on a decision made at a joint meeting, has decided that, starting July 30th, the check clearing time for silver and money businesses will be uniformly moved earlier to 9:00 AM daily. Furthermore, revisions have been made to the times and methods for receiving checks, returning checks, clearing, and entrusting exchanges, which have been circulated to all members for compliance. In addition, three regulations have been stipulated for customers of various money exchange houses and banks, which will also be implemented simultaneously on the aforementioned date.</p>
<p>The time for all members to receive customer deposits of checks will be the same as their business hours (9:00 AM to 1:00 PM).</p>
<p>Checks deposited by customers into banks and money exchange houses can only be credited to the account on the following day. With the exception of returned checks due to insufficient funds, all check amounts can only be withdrawn on the third day. (For example, if a check amount is deposited on Monday, it can only be withdrawn on Wednesday; if a check amount is deposited on Saturday, it can only be withdrawn on the following Tuesday.)</p>
<p>Customers of all businesses can also pre-deposit unmatured checks with banks and money exchange houses for collection before the maturity date, and the account will still be credited on the check's maturity date.</p>
<p>According to a financial insider who spoke to the reporter, the implementation of the next-day check clearing system by silver and money businesses is purely because the number of checks has increased daily, making it impossible to clear and reconcile excess funds daily. This system is implemented as a remedy. The reason for advancing the clearing time is that each bank and money exchange house prepares the checks from the previous day in advance, and with ample time, 9:00 AM is considered an appropriate clearing time. However, customers must note that funds can only be withdrawn starting on the third day from the date of deposit. It is hoped that customers of all banks and money exchange houses will pay special attention to this. If funds are deposited on Monday and withdrawn on Tuesday, they will undoubtedly be rejected. As for customers who can pre-deposit unmatured checks into banks and money exchange houses, the crediting date must wait until the maturity date of the check.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e39">Expectations for Wealthy Merchants and Traders <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the social service department of this newspaper received a donation of over 63 million yuan on behalf of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Suzhou private industrial and commercial sectors for air raid relief. We are deeply impressed by their concern from afar.</p>
<p>After receiving donations from all sectors of Jiangsu Province, we immediately felt that the benevolence of wealthy individuals residing in Shanghai is not as great as that of friends from afar. We have been collecting donations for eight days, and statistics show that the most common donations are below 100,000 yuan, indicating that the concern for public welfare is leaning towards the working class. Apart from a very few wealthy individuals who generously donate large sums, most wealthy merchants and traders are notoriously stingy and unwilling to show any compassion.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that there are countless extremely wealthy individuals in Shanghai today, with properties worth millions or more. If they could show a moment of benevolence and donate one-thousandth of their wealth to relieve people's suffering, a huge amount of funds could be raised immediately. It is estimated that the cost of air raid relief will require at least 200 million yuan, which may be difficult to raise without relying on larger donations. We sincerely hope that wealthy merchants and traders will open the door to convenience and donate some funds.</p>

<h3 id="e40">"Family Doctor" Scholarship Movement to Be Expanded; Students Encouraged to Promote Sales During Summer Vacation <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Since the launch of the "Family Doctor" scholarship movement, it has become widely popular in just three or four days, reminiscent of "Luoyang paper becomes expensive." In recent days, people from all walks of life have come to the office to purchase "Family Doctor," and some have even called to order books, indicating that this book is valued by the general public. We feel that the number of students participating in the fundraising campaign is only 300, which is too few, and therefore the effect has not been significant. According to our budget, we need 2,000 students to carry out the campaign separately in order to conclude it in a short period. We will send letters to various universities, colleges, and high schools within days, requesting the principals to select a large number of students to come to the office to discuss and jointly promote the campaign, taking advantage of the summer vacation to dedicate some time to fundraising for "Family Doctor." This is a meaningful and valuable endeavor for both public and private interests. For example, if one person sells 50 books and raises a total of 250,000 yuan in donations, each student can receive a subsidy of 125,000 yuan, and our newspaper's scholarship and youth work-study loan can also receive 125,000 yuan. This is truly a win-win situation. Students, being aware of the greater good, should remember this and come forward!</p>
<p>Donations for Scholarships Yesterday Reach Highest Record</p>
<p>Yesterday, donations for scholarships reached over 10 million yuan, the highest record since the start of the fundraising campaign this year. Among them, Mr. Zhu Mingyu's donation of over 9 million yuan, which he transferred from gifts intended for his birthday celebration, was the largest amount. Mr. Zhu's dedication to scholarships and his extraordinary generosity are deeply admired by colleagues. His relatives and friends who generously contributed to the celebration and dedicated everything to charitable causes are also deeply appreciated, not just by Mr. Zhu alone. In addition, Daxin H記 donated 500,000 yuan, which was the sum of a customer's misplaced money and their own donation. Sun 鎌祥 was deeply moved after repeatedly reading our fundraising appeal and pledged to support a team, showing a sincere heart. Wan Tai Money Exchange and Huafeng Bank (jointly pledged by Mr. Li Chuanding and Mr. Zhou Jun) each pledged a team, responding to the call for all banks and money exchange houses to jointly support scholarships, living up to the expectations of our newspaper colleagues, which is truly commendable. There are many other team pledges, which will not be listed individually, and sincere thanks are given.</p>

<p>Military vehicles of various military organs stationed in this city have been using Shanghai Army license plates for a long time.

The procedures for recalling the license plates are outlined below: For domestic military organs stationed in Shanghai, the license plates should be returned in writing. For military organs of friendly or other countries, in addition to notifying them in writing to return the license plates, the Bureau will also compile a "List of Names and License Plate Numbers of Each User Organ" and send it to the liaison organs of each country in Shanghai for assistance. If these vehicles wish to continue operating, they can apply for regular license plates from the Bureau of Construction according to the prescribed procedures.</p>
