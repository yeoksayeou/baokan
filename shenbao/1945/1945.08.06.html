<h3>緬境日軍佔領米基喜丹河右岸激戰　對東瓜方面增兵亦予反擊</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地五日中央社電日軍部隊渡過喜丹河後，繼續前進，二十六日對於萊巴脫丙（紐卡休西方）之敵軍約四百名加以攻擊，殺傷其半數以上，更於二十九日夜半，奪取薩特滑琴（庇古東北四公里）及其西南方B　M332陣地，於喜丹河灣曲部北部日軍之進擊，直接可威脅庇古。敵方亦承認日軍之進擊稱，「二十九日於披瑪亞北十三公里地點，曾遇日軍之堅强抵抗，展開激戰」。又庇古東北四十公里之英印軍亦聲稱，「於喜丹河右岸，遭遇日軍之攻擊」。庇古之失陷，已迫在眉睫。又渡過喜丹河之日別動部隊，二十八日晨由米基西方高地對敵猛攻，佔領米基，更於米基方面採取新攻勢。日軍有力部隊，二十四日猛攻鄧達溫，擊退約二百敵軍，將之佔領，敵正謀由東瓜方面增加兵力，日軍斷然反擊中。</p>
<p>緬甸前綫基地五日中央社電喜丹河日軍渡河之急速進擊，敵軍動搖愈益增大，古塞克（米基北方十五公里）對岸敵軍，日來繼續向西遁走，現退至東瓜及恩伊茲萊（米基北方七公里）方面，構築陣地中。又二十八日晨日軍佔領米基，敵於二十九日反復來攻，日軍部隊乘機對之痛擊，堅守該地陣地。又二十九日夜，日軍精銳進入巴古東北方約四十公里之薩特滑琴附近，繼續敢行壯絕之挺身突擊，三十一日奇襲阿披亞（庇古北方三十五公里）敵陣，令敵膽寒。</p>

<p>里斯本五日中央社電據馬尼刺電，麥克沃塞司令部於三日發表稱，美陸軍戰略航空隊司令官大將史巴茲，頃於馬尼刺與麥克沃塞及遠東航空隊司令官大將凱尼協議對日轟炸策略。</p>
<h3>關東九州先後被襲</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　四日上午九時四十五分左右，敵機B24型二架，飛至日本土上空偵察，爲日制空部隊追襲，將其一架擊落。又五日上午由硫黃島出發之P51型約八十架，分三批來襲關東地區立川左近，並攻擊神奈地。</p>
<p>東京五日中央</p>

<h3>新幾內亞戰鬥　澳洲軍受損</h3>
<p>南方前綫基地五日中央社電澳洲軍第六師約一萬名，由新幾內亞北岸之維瓦克及馬古力庫方面開始進擊，欲期一舉突破亞歷山大山脈。六月十日拂曉敵復於重砲掩護下，企圖前進，然日軍維瓦克守備部隊據守該山脈南麓之陣地，古服新幾內亞特有之濕地帶，迎日勇鬥，與敵莫大損害。按該日軍部隊自本年初迄七月末之間，予敵之損害，即確認之敵軍遺棄屍體已達六千，實際殺傷敵兵總數，恐不下九千名，其戰果實爲驚人。</p>
<h3>峇厘巴板　日軍肉搏戰</h3>
<p>峇厘巴板五日中央社電敵軍於距三馬林達十五公里至二十公里之地點，構築陣地，然並未向正而進攻，一切行動，僅爲前哨戰而已。日軍守備隊仍於夜間施行肉搏戰，予敵以相當损害。丹巴頓方面之敵軍，力圖掩護下逐次前來攻擊，臼軍守備隊自十九日以來，擊退其一部，七月三十日及八月二日所獲之戰果，計殺傷敵軍約百名，破壞帳棚五處，物資堆集一處。</p>
<h3>美陸軍損害　逾百名損害</h3>

<h3>東亞各地戰况</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電本週各地戰况如次：</p>
<p>海上部隊　敵海上部隊自七月十日以來，於硫黃島及冲繩一帶繼續行動約一月之久，迄七月三十日復以飛機一千架對關東，近畿方面實施航空作戰，而小羣艦艇亦與此呼應，三十日對濱松，三十一日對淸水加以艦砲射擊。又敵潛水艇亦對樺太北海道方而陸上開始艦砲射擊，日軍方面則儲備銳力，以對空砲火及一部制空部隊展開迎擊戰，截止現在止，本週共擊落敵小型機一百四十六架，擊毀一百九十八架，同時，日潛永艇部隊亦於中南太平洋活躍，最近擊沉敵戰艦，　運船等數艘。</p>
<p>冲繩方面　冲繩方面敵軍，現正銳意强化基地中，該方面似已保有B24型飛機六百架左右，最近該方面運輸船極少，蓋恐因大舉增强陸上設施，以致無暇補給增强基地之資材。又該方面之B24型，B25型及戰鬥機聯合編隊約三百架，曾於日前來襲九州方面，然因颶風關係，其行動極爲遲緩。</p>
<p>馬里亞納　美軍口稱，攻擊日方中小都市時，將預先通告攻擊目標，欲期攪亂日本人心，其夜間燒夷彈之盲炸尚繼續實行，對於殘存之工塲專事投擲炸彈。自該方面來襲之B24，B29大型機，前後約共兩萬架，與上月之五千架相較，有顯著之增加，蓋七月份來襲機中，有敵艦載機前後達八千架在內之故。</p>
<p>緬甸方面　日軍依據庇古山脈要地，長期牽制敵軍，對仰光。瓦城間公路及仰光·克樓姆間公路等敵援渝動脈，予以重大威脅，使美軍補給不得圓滑。日軍與自喜丹河渡河作戰之友軍緊密連絡，予敵莫大打擊，現芷逐次整備喜丹河東岸地區戰淺中。</p>
<p>玻根維爾　日軍現正勇戰奮鬥中，米饒及中部之怒馬地區，日軍部隊以巧妙之反攻與敵莫大損害，日軍自七月中旬以來，於米饒河地區殺傷敵兵五百三十九名，被毀汽車二十餘輛。又於七月一日迄十八日之間，於怒馬地區一帶殺敵兵七十名，該島北方布加島敵軍，最近開始蠢動，出動斥堠隊，企圖潛入日軍陣地，日軍則於各地伏兵，乘良機一臨，即起殺敵，並擾亂敵軍後方，近數日間，已殺害敵軍數十名。</p>
<h3>貝比森談太平洋戰爭　結束尙需時日</h3>
<p>廣州五日中央社電</p>
<p>據重慶中央社電：此次由印度轉調中國戰綫之美第十航空隊司令貝比森，業於七月上旬抵達昆明，曾就對華補充軍需問題，對往訪之中央社記者談述如次：美國是否將對重慶輸送大量飛機，第一在目前之補充上問題尙多，蓋據數之多寡，以美國補充能力之高下而定。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>三頭會議的結果</h3>
<p>這次英美蘇三國領袖的柏林會談，曾爲國際視聽所集中，認爲對於未來世界局勢，將發生大的影響。同時，因爲會議舉行之時，適當歐戰已吿結束，而大部分有關歐洲的戰後問題，已曾在克里米亞會議及舊金山會議有所決定，所以一般人便推想到這次三頭會談，一定要　論到東亞問題了，而且，甚至於有人說，該會議以東亞問題爲中心。當然，這種推斷，並不是響壁虛構，而有相當事實根據的，綜合會議前英美各方面的報道，顯然可以看到，英美兩國當局，曾盡一切力量，企圖合力以促蘇聯參加對日戰爭的。</p>
<p>可是，三頭會議自七月十七日至八月二日，先後舉行正式集會十三次，於八月三日在三國首都發表公報，綜觀內容，可見這次三頭會　，仍以對德國的處分及歐洲戰後問題爲中心，並未對東亞問題成立任何完整的決定。這是英美方面極大的失敗，挑撥日蘇衝突的企圖及活動，已再一次遭受澈底失收了。爲着避免國人的責問，特魯曼還不及返國，就先行宣布對蘇聯讓步的理由，足見其內心是何等的苦悶！</p>
<p>英美在逍次三頭會議中的失敗，並不是偶然的。第一，當然由於蘇聯在這次歐洲戰爭中，出力最多，而犧牲亦最慘重，因此發言的地位提高了。第二，很顯然的，在外交上，特魯曼非羅斯福可比，不足爲史太林的勁敵。第三，英國國會總選舉保守黨失敗，邱吉爾因此在會議中途退出，更使史太林占了優勢。此外，更可注意的有兩點：一是蘇聯全國，有如蘇聯元首加里寗氏所謂，已經「脫離戰鬥生活，走向復員生活，走向和平復興建設生活」，再不容被他人唆使而走向另一種流血的戰爭；二是英美國內人民，也充滿了厭戰求和的情緒，其間特別是英國保守黨在總選中的失敗，工黨的勝利，更充分反映人民的注意力，已由對外轉向對內。在這種新的　境之巾，任何　　　大戰爭的陰謀，必然會遭遇失敗。</p>
<p>所以，三頭會議對於東亞問題毫無具體的決定，並不是意外的結果。但是，這並不能說，我們就此可以無庸顧慮敵方的新的策動。因爲英美對遠東的制覇野心，是和美英帝國主義制度不可分划的，除非英美常局決定放棄其帝國主義的政策，英美的任何首腦上台，都將繼續爲保全其在遠東的殖民地及特殊權益而堅持戰爭的。爲着堅持戰爭，他們會千方百計地製造不利於日本及東亞的新環境。何况三頭會議同時曾由英美渝三者，發表所謂促使日本無條件投降的共同宣言，而三頭會議又有儘九月一日以前，在倫敦召開五國外長會議的決定，這個五國評議會的任務，雖然主要在處理歐洲及一般國際問題，但難保在這期間，英美不另行其他策動。</p>
<p>三頭會議中英美挑撥日蘇衝突的失敗，使我們對於東亞人解決東亞問題，建立東亞人的東亞的信念，更加堅定。世界大勢對此已益見有利，我們當本旣定國策，勇往直前，以達成大東亞戰爭之目的。</p>
<h3>利空路輸送軍需</h3>
<p>美國爲期縮短戰爭期間，乃對中國進行最大限度之空輸，現沿海一帶港灣雖多恢復，然空輸仍係重要補充手段，尤其在　　交通不便之中國，更屬必　。貝比森氏並力言，太平洋戰爭之前途，必須繼續苦戰一年或二年方可結束。</p>
<h3>建輸油管工人怠工</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　據路透社重慶電：駐渝美軍司令韋特曼三日曾就關於受美國軍事教練之重慶軍之貸與武器問題，發表聲明謂，與該問題極關緊要之印度。重慶間輸油管之建設工人，近來全體怠工，致工務進行不利。復言因某種軍需物資，亦將不再向渝輸運，目下正檢討對策中。</p>
<h3>美軍潛水艇一艘被擊沉</h3>
<p>前綫航空基地五日中央社電日軍航空部隊，四日上午時十三分左右，於犬吠岬東南方之海面上，發見美軍潛水艦，乃開始猛烈攻擊，加以機槍掃射，多數命中艦橋首部，敵潛艦遂連噴火烟而急潛下，突然又發出大爆炸聲，而該艦遂更深潛水中，至下午四時許，經日方偵察結果，附近海面有甚多頗長之油紋與木片浮動，因之該潛水艦之被擊沉，　經讀實。</p>
<h3>兩月來之浙江　（二）</h3>
<p>— 博英</p>
<h3>防疫衛生</h3>
<p>時屆夏令，易滋疫　橫行，影響社會，殊爲重大，省府非常重視，爲未雨綢繆計，經設置浙省防疫委員會，負責推進浙省防疫工作，派員在滬購大批疫苗運杭，分發杭州市政府及各縣政府，實行注射防疫針，並籌設時疫醫院於糧這山，其他對於衛生有關設施之省立醫院，亦加以强化改進，而適合人民需要。</p>
<h3>强化土產管理</h3>
<p>浙省土產，素稱豐富，行銷東南各地遠及華北一帶，實爲浙省財源大宗，事變後因交通關係，其運輸物資已步入往昔之圓滑，丁氏對物資之移動，深切關懷，爲開發浙省資奪，獎勵浙省土產運銷各地計，特加以强化管理，自六月一日起將藥材，磁器山貨草蓆等四項土產，劃圖浙省土產管理處理，於七月一日起復商盟軍方面，將軍用有關之油脂類及其他原料，鐵及非鐵金屬，竹木薪炭獸肉類蔬菜類等六種土產，亦劃鬬該處管理此浙省土產物資流通，因管理的而得趨於圓滑，俾益人民經濟，更非淺詳。</p>
<h3>推進農</h3>
<p>當茲大東亞戰爭已屬決戰階段。我國勵行農業增業爲刻不容緩之圖，丁省長到任之時，正係蝗蝻將起爲害之際，爲維護農家產物計，一面嚴令各縣實行防治蝗蝻辦法，使蝗蝻不致爲害農村，並爲鑒於鐵路沿綫隙地頗多，業置可惜，遂令沿鐵路各縣切實勸導民衆，利用鐵路旁隙地，種植雜糧，藉以增加農業生產。並派專門技正，前往隨時指導，現已收相當成效。又以養蜂素爲農家副業，特令飭杭·嘉興·平湖等縣勸導人民飼養，對蜂房經過，予以保護。又爲增進農業增產工作起見，特將浙省府所屬各農業機關加以調整，如省立第一農事試騐塲改爲杭州農塲，省立育苗塲改爲杭州苗圃，其他省立第二農業試騐塲，予以撤銷，交嘉興縣政府保管，並成立技術室於建設廳內，負責計劃農產增進設施工作，以求實效。現該室正在計劃進行，在杭屬各縣墾殖四百畝農田，至其餘各縣墾殖事宜，則交由各縣該地合作社辦理。</p>
<h3>修築公路</h3>
<p>浙省公路，素極發達，事變以來，因遭戰爭破壞，以致或全部不能通車或縱能通車亦不能順利行駛，交通滯礙重重，行旅異常痛苦，丁氏鑒於公路與人民生活，經濟，交通，關係至巨，特强化公路機構，將原有公路管理處，改爲浙江省工路局，了氏自兼局長，以便銳意推進。並同時成立杭富，，杭善，杭餘，杭吳，四公路管理處，辦理護路，養路，及有關管理事務，現已進行修理者，有杭富公路，杭餘公路，杭善公路，杭吳公路，及蘇嘉公路浙之一段，尚有　紹公路，紹鄭等路亦正計劃修理，其初步工程經費達五萬萬元之巨，倘能全部修竣，浙省交通，又可恢復事變前之盛况矣、</p>
<h3>整飭水利</h3>
<p>年來水路交通阻滯，因此商民貨　不能暢達，人民深感痛苦，而浙省之水利未修，由來已久，不但影響農家灌溉，且對於交通亦有妨礙，丁省長接事後，即對省內水利積極從事整飭，除機構方面撤銷原有浙塘工水利局另行成立浙江省水利局，派林建設廳長兼任局長，負責整理浙省水利事業外，現正計劃疏溶杭縣下塘河，浦陽江，及蕭山湘湖等處，一俟計劃完成，即可實行疏溶工作。其他各河亦將次第分期施工。又經成立浙塘工督導處，已將破壞之海寗南門外「好，爵，自，都，」四字號海塘，招商修理，現已開工，約俟秋汎後，即可全部完工。　（未完）</p>
<h3>日海上戰士組織船舶救難義勇隊　海軍省昨日發出命令</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電日海軍省於五日發出命令，在敵機敵潛艇戚脅下，果敢救濟船舶之海上戰士，共同組織船舶救難義勇戰鬥隊，該戰鬥隊之隊員，包括遭難船舶救助業，打撈沉船業，拆卸船舶業，潛水夫以及指導監督者，復爲激勵其士氣，並期其完成職務，賦予與軍人同樣之資格。</p>

<p>湖北省長駐武漢綏靖主任葉　上將，日前由漢來京，晉謁陳代主席述職，並請示機宜。中央社記者爲明瞭鄂省施政現况，特於昨日趨前訪謁，承答前次：（問）自省長蒞任後，對治鄂省施政有何改進？（答）本人奉命長鄂後，唯一之目的，即爲安定民生及澄清吏治，在本人抵漢之後，武漢與南京物價相等，但經省府當局一武漢之物價，較首都約低十鐘左右，人民生活可以安定無慮。至于澄清吏治，先從改善軍警，保證公務員之待遇着手，使其生活安定，然後再嚴立法規，以「養生」與「養廉」爲本，舉凡公務人員不否則依公務員犯贓治罪條例重懲不貸。（問）邇來敵機在武漢頻頻轟炸，省長對於市面有何計劃？（答）奈於鄂省目睹被敵機，故余就任伊始，曾在京滬召集湖北同鄕，舉辦募捐大會，籌得鉅款，普賬災黎，並健全防空設備，更向中央請示　發武漢復興公債，以建築市區恢復工廠，以期大漢口市之迅速復興。（問）省長長鄂以來，感想如何？（答）本人抵漢以後，觀察民衆之精神極爲振奮，對於參戰中國環境，已經相當認識，尤以在武漢之盟邦當局對于武漢施政之協助，誠可謂不遺餘力，當地友軍更多支援，本人對此，代表全鄂民衆深表謝意。</p>
<h3>同盟社記者評三國宣言</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電</p>
<p>關於波次坦會談，日同盟社記者幷上勇三日夜於東京廣播，批評此次會談爲蘇聯一方而之勝利，蘇聯此後更可放胆處理德國，其要旨如次：波次坦會談之公報，僅爲雅爾達公報之附屬文而已，關於德國將來之問題，例如來因拉特。魯爾以及食糧等難問題，並未解決其一，關於統治方式之一致，亦僅以「於實施可能之範圍內」一語了之。會談之成果，全是刻板文章，難覓一種自由的理想主義之片言隻句，該共同聲明，實爲要求蘇聯與日作戰之美英與論，聊以塞責而已。</p>
<h3>賴伐爾力自辯護未與德軍事合作　貝當要求改日再審</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　據巴黎訉：前維希政府首長賴伐爾，於昨日貝當元首受第十二次審訊時，以見證人之資格出庭，爲其本人昔日所施之政策以「不得不如此」之一語激烈辯護。常庭上詢渠如何得數千名法國工人供給希特勒戰時生產所用，渠辯稱，「關於此項舉動，亦出諸於不得已，我以三百名法國勞工易取十萬名獄中囚徒，何謂不是上策，其時比利時因朱曾組立政府，祗得將全國百分之八十勞工供給德國應用，而我法國其時因有政府組立，僅將全國百分之十八勞工供給德國應用」。同時渠又極口否認貝當在聯合國攻打迭埃普時致電希特勒，欲得法國軍隊助德，以擊退聯合國方面之再度攻擊或登陸一項情事。賴伐爾聲稱，「我對於與德國間實行軍事合作，均極力反對」。然其時貝當之辯護律師皆堅持該電並非爲貝當所發，貝當僅在該電上簽名而已，故當該電自維希政府發出時，註明「貝當簽名」。當庭上訊及北非之事時，賴伐爾聲稱，「此爲達朗將軍之事，與我無涉，彼曾命令法軍對任何一方面政擊，均應抵抗並擊退之，故法軍曾與聯合國軍方面起衝突。」檢察官再訊將猶太人交至德國之一項問題時，賴伐爾答稱，「我使猶太人重復國籍」。此時貝當元首忽要求庭上改日再審，因渠實不耐疲乏，於是審訊又告中斷。</p>
<h3>韃靼海峽問題談判陷僵局　土拒對蘇作領土讓步</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　據倫敦消息，在波次坦會議結束後所發表之英美蘇三國聯合公告中，絲毫未聞有提及韃靼尼爾海峽之將來問題，由此可見蘇聯與土耳其間之新友好協定已陷於僵局。刻下雖無權威方面消息發表，然根據可靠方面報吿，在初夏已開始之蘇土談判，迄今尙無結果，且在數週前突吿中斷，蓋土耳其政府已拒絕對蘇聯作領土上之讓步。且於日前發表聲明，略謂，「蘇政府所提出欲修訂韃靼尼爾海峽規章一項建議，實不應排除其他有利害關係之各國，而由蘇土獨斷獨行」。現倫敦外交界均認爲，蘇土談判之成敗如何，須視各大國間對韃靼尼爾海峽問題有所妥善之協議。</p>
<h3>尼赫魯主建　「南亞聯邦」</h3>
<p>百倫五日中央社電</p>
<p>據克什米爾訊，印度會議派領袖尼赫魯，曾於克什米爾國民會議（印度親會議派會議）席上發表，欲組織一「南亞細亞洲聯邦」，該聯邦包括印度，伊朗，阿富汗，伊拉克，緬甸，錫安。渠聲稱，「我印度會議派向極反對將印度一國分劃數個小組，目前我印度爲經濟政策，國防計劃，決希望印度能成一統一之家，蓋一切小國在明日之世界上已失去彼等之地位，所謂小國者實月旁之陪星，亦無非爲大國獵逐之樂園，今我印度若再分裂，必然滅亡，在今日之世界上，有兩大强國即××與美國，在明日之世界上必將增加兩大强國，即印度與中國，此外決無第五國之强國」</p>

<h3>空襲下的幾種必要措置</h3>
<p>— 詩洲</p>
<p>本市地區自七月十七日以來，曾連續四次遭受美機來襲，規模亦遠較過去爲大，中區·東區·北區·東北區·南區·分別遭受盲炸，民房倒坍甚多，市民死傷竟有數千人之多。此後美機必將繼續來襲，本市處此嚴重威脅下，對於能促進市民安全之各項必要措施，甚望能在最短期內次第完成爲妥，以下各點望各關係方面能立即出以最迅速之行動，付諸實施。</p>
<p>命令全市各大厦及建築較堅固之公共塲所，在空襲警報發令後，應儘量收容避難之行人，不准關閉大門，二樓以上一律組織特別自警團　守，嚴防歹徒混入生事，違者處罰。</p>
<p>重申前令，命令各沿馬路之商舖住家，一律重新交叉張貼堅靱之紙條，有排門板之店舖，于空襲警報發令後，亦應立即裝上排門板，以免炸　落下時震碎玻璃，增加受傷之行人。</p>
<p>本市各街這沿途所掘之防空壕，往往堆積垃圾及淤水，一旦正式需用時，市民勢必將彷舊壕畔，無法趨避，故當局亟應趕速飭令人役負責打掃，在規定期內早日完工，俾利臨時緊急使用。</p>
<p>獎勵疏散，儘量給予離滬市民以廉價及便利，規定凡疏散離滬之本市人口，得本區內保甲當局之書而證明，均得以行莊本票購買車船票。該項本票得由乘客在離滬前申請熟識之商號機關保付。</p>
<p>指導若干地區無力遷居之市民，趕早組織防空救護特別狐，並廉價配給救傷必要醫藥品，如棉花·紗布·綳帶·紅藥水稀碘酊等，該項書藥品由保甲當局負資保管，並隨時派員或召集，訓練其用法。一且不需用時，應即全部照原價退還當局。</p>
<p>市政當局主催，聯合全市各大醫院及運輸汽車業公會組織廣泛的救傷系統，各區互相呼應，一區出事，附近約定各區即應自動前來協助，俾傷者能在最短時間立即獲得治療，無慮因時間延隔過久而致傷勢加劇或竟無辜死亡。</p>
<p>特別優待受災人民，凡災民手持行莊本票並得附近保甲當局之書面證明者，在出事後三日內，均得至中央儲備銀行或中儲指定代理銀行，憑票十足掉換現鈔，以供災民受難後善後緊急需費。該項現鈔請中儲負責供給，惟掉換數額應有規定，以五十萬元以下爲原則，有特別事故者得申請增給之。</p>
<h3>便利疏散者乘車應提早軋票時間</h3>
<p>— 吳則民</p>
<p>邇來空襲頻甚，市民均在自動疏散中，惟目下船隻交通不便，十九皆改鐵道轉途，故火車乘客形成非常擁擠。際此時期，而華鐵職員工作一本過往，毫無非常時期緊急措置，以協助當局疏散計劃。譬如滬杭綫早車是七時三十十分開車，而軋票處往往遲至七時十五分才開始軋票，試問此短短十五分鐘能放進多少乘客，以致洛後者均不得上車，不票作廢，敝人等戚友中已有三人遇着。請想際此車票漲價而難購到之時疏散者，無論於精神上經濟上均受不起如此打擊。故希望</p>
<p>有票者必須設法使之上車，萬一過份擁擠時，則優先改乘下一次車，車票仍舊有效，不必任何蓋印等手續，以免變方麻煩。</p>
<p>車站大門於早晨六時開放旅客進入大門後於軋票處，不必再排隊，隨到隨軋，直接進入月合上車或候車。</p>
<p>如能照上述辦法實行，則有票者當不致會因軋票時間侷促而乘不着車，而且車站秩序定必比較良好。</p>
<h3>本市公用事業　應用官民共同節制</h3>

<p>上海的公用事業—包括電力·電車·電話·自來水及煤氣—在戰前無論是收費或行政方面，均由市政當局予以管理。自大東亞戰爭爆發後，各種公用事業均置於軍管理之下，直至去年七月，始解除軍管理，由華中各公司經營，對於收費行政，另有機關核定，不受市府節制</p>
<p>最近爲公用事業，因物價飛漲，也紛紛的調整價目增加押　。總計在本年七個月的時期中，已有三次之多，每次又高至二倍或三倍有奇。至於服務方面，職員態度的不遜，服務效力的低落，限制的不當，修理的遲緩，又是衆目共覩的事實。最近因票據貼現問題，各公司也拒收支票。雖然一部份可說是戰時不可避免的事，但是大部份是人謀的不蕆</p>
<p>我們並不反對，因維持戰工生活，或材料飛漲而加價，但是我們要知道在運用方面，是否合理。例如：材料方面，應用有無荒廢，款項方面，支配是否合宜，人事方面，處理是否得當，限制是否合理。</p>
<p>公用事業與市民的關係，並不下於市府之於民衆；反之，因市民日常所需，如水電等，皆仰給於公用事業，其關係較市府行政，更爲密切。所以我們主張如各公用事業應受市府，或市民所組織的團體，如市政諮詢委員會等所節制。至少，在市府勵行肅情貪污，增加行政效能聲中，我們希望各公用事業當局注意其職員的行動，是否奉公守法，廉潔目愛，有無越軌情事，則全市人民受惠非淺矣。</p>
<h3>利用和平神座基　改建紀念碑</h3>
<p>— 虹</p>
<p>今年八月一日是接收租界二周年紀念日，憶去年一周紀念時，市政常局曾在南京路外灘，舉行建立紀念事奠基典禮，但迄今一年尚未動工，自然經費材料都成問題。</p>
<p>所以我敬向市當局及市諮詢委員會建議：請停築紀念亭，改利用大上海路外難和平神座基建爲紀念碑，所有四週面積均可鐫上紀念文字，飪壯觀瞻且埀久遠，同時亦可節省防力人力。</p>
<p>查建築物的改迭利用，亦非無先例可循，譬如：北平在庚子八國聯軍時所建被戕德公使紀念碑，後即改建爲第一次歐戰協約國勝利紀念碑，南京中山北路維新政府所建周年紀念碑後亦改爲大東亞戰爭紀念碑等。希望市政當局採納蒭　，則幸甚矣。</p>
<h3>數旅館爲災民醫院</h3>
<p>— 日永</p>
<p>七月二十日本　的國　　　，有人主張改　舞　爲災民醫院，却是至蓋。不過我以爲與其把跳舞應改做災民醫院，倒不如把旅館改做災民醫院爲較好。因爲醫院須有牀舖的設備，跳舞應並沒省此設備，所以我主張把旅館改作災民醫院較爲妥當。</p>
<p>說到上海的旅館，早已失去了「安寓客商」的本旨，變成爲一切罪惡的淵藪了。你看，嫖，　，鴉片，以及其他的作奸犯科，，是不是都發生在旅館之中？那麼，把上海的旅館改爲災民醫院，不僅是被災的人民受到了無窮的恩惠，同時，使上海的嫖，賭，鴉片以及作奸犯科的事失去了根據地，至少使上海的社會，可以得到若干時間的淸靜和安寗，這是有誰敢說不相宜呢！</p>
<p>再有，旅館中的茶役，本來是做着招待服侍的工作，一朝使他們失業，也是不大好的。若是改了災民醫院之後，他們可以做服侍病人的工作，他們便可不失業。同時，他們本來做着低賤的僕役工作，現在把他們改爲服侍病人的神聖工作，不是把他們的地位和人格都增高了嗎？</p>
<p>我不是帮助躁舞應，在今日的情形之下，　舞廳也不過是暴發戶的銷金地，對社會根本沒有什麼好處的，不過他的罪惡，似乎比了旅館小一些。因爲他沒有可以作爲醫院的設備，所以我主張不妨改爲難民收容所。但願社會人士，共同起來，對我這個主張，促其實現，則社會幸甚！</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles on the Right Bank of the Mekeik River Occupied by Japanese Troops in Burma; Reinforcements to Donggua Area Also Counterattacked</h3>
<p>Burma Frontline Base, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese troops, after crossing the Sitang River, continued their advance. On the 26th, they attacked approximately 400 enemy troops at Leiktho, inflicting casualties on more than half of them. Furthermore, on the 29th at midnight, they seized Satthwa Chaung (4 kilometers northeast of Pegu) and its southwest B M332 position. The Japanese advance in the northern part of the Sitang River bend directly threatens Pegu. The enemy also acknowledged the Japanese advance, stating, "On the 29th, we encountered strong Japanese resistance 13 kilometers north of Pyu, and fierce battles ensued." The British Indian Army, 40 kilometers northeast of Pegu, also claimed, "We encountered a Japanese attack on the right bank of the Sitang River." The fall of Pegu is imminent. In addition, the Japanese special forces that crossed the Sitang River launched a fierce attack on the enemy from the highlands west of Mekeik on the morning of the 28th, occupying Mekeik, and launched a new offensive in the Mekeik area. Powerful Japanese forces fiercely attacked Toungoo on the 24th, repelling approximately 200 enemy troops and occupying it. The enemy is planning to increase its forces from the Toungoo area, and the Japanese are resolutely counterattacking.</p>
<p>Burma Frontline Base, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy's agitation is increasing due to the rapid Japanese advance across the Sitang River. The enemy troops on the opposite bank of Kyaukse (15 kilometers north of Mekeik) have been continuously retreating westward in recent days, now retreating to the Toungoo and Inywa Le (7 kilometers north of Mekeik) areas, constructing defenses. Furthermore, the Japanese troops occupied Mekeik on the morning of the 28th. The enemy launched repeated counterattacks on the 29th, and the Japanese troops took the opportunity to inflict heavy blows on them, firmly holding the position. Furthermore, on the night of the 29th, elite Japanese troops entered the vicinity of Satthwa Chaung, approximately 40 kilometers northeast of Pegu, continuing their daring and heroic suicide attacks. On the 31st, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy camp at Apya (35 kilometers north of Pegu), terrifying the enemy.</p>
<h3>Elite Japanese Bombing Squadron Night Raid on Three Okinawa Airfields; Base Transferred to MacArthur's Command</h3>
<p>Frontline Aviation Base, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A squadron of elite Japanese Army bombers launched a fierce attack on three airfields in the northern, central, and Ie Shima areas of Okinawa Island late on the night of the 4th. The enemy troops were caught off guard and in extreme disarray. The Japanese Army has confirmed that fires broke out in fifteen locations at the enemy airfields, sending up thick smoke.</p>
<h3>U.S. Generals Confer on Bombing Strategies</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Manila dispatch states that MacArthur's headquarters announced on the 4th: Marshal MacArthur has now included all of the Ryukyu Islands (including Okinawa) as U.S. military offensive bases, under the command of his headquarters. This change of command (transfer from Nimitz to MacArthur) will take effect at midnight on the 7th. The Thirteenth Air Force, stationed in southern Philippines and New Guinea, is currently moving to the Ryukyu base. The Eighth Air Force under Doolittle is not under MacArthur's command and will conduct independent operations.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Manila dispatch, MacArthur's headquarters announced on the 3rd that U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces commander General Spaatz recently conferred with MacArthur and Far East Air Forces commander General Kenney in Manila on bombing strategies against Japan.</p>
<h3>Kanto and Kyushu Attacked in Succession</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At around 9:45 AM on the morning of the 4th, two enemy B-24 aircraft flew over Japan for reconnaissance. They were pursued by Japanese air defense forces, who shot down one of them. Furthermore, on the morning of the 5th, approximately 80 P-51s, departing from Iwo Jima, attacked the Kanto area of Tachikawa Sakon in three waves, and also attacked Kanagawa.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th</p>
<p>Eight P-38s from the Okinawa base, starting at 7:00 AM on the 5th, operated around Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Oita, retreating by 9:00 AM. At around 11:30 AM, approximately 50 B-24s, 20 B-25s, and approximately 20 smaller aircraft invaded from Kagoshima Bay, operating in the Satsuma Peninsula and retreating at 2:00 PM. Furthermore, four B-24s, two P-38s, and forty smaller aircraft separately attacked the southern part of Miyazaki Prefecture, the Satsuma Peninsula, and the eastern part of Oita Prefecture.</p>
<h3>Australian Forces Suffer Losses in New Guinea Fighting</h3>
<p>Southern Frontline Base, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Approximately 10,000 men of the Australian 6th Division began an offensive from Wewak and Maguericul area on the north coast of New Guinea, attempting to break through the Alexander Mountains in one fell swoop. At dawn on June 10th, the enemy attempted to advance again under heavy artillery cover, but the Japanese Wewak garrison held the positions on the southern foot of the mountains, overcame the unique swamps of New Guinea, and fought bravely against the enemy, inflicting great losses on them. According to information, from the beginning of this year to the end of July, the damage inflicted on the enemy by the Japanese forces, including confirmed enemy bodies left behind, has reached 6,000. The actual total number of enemy soldiers killed or wounded is feared to be no less than 9,000, a truly astonishing result.</p>
<h3>Balikpapan: Japanese Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat</h3>
<p>Balikpapan, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy has built defenses in a location 15 to 20 kilometers from Samarinda, but they have not launched a direct attack. All actions are merely skirmishes. The Japanese garrison continues to conduct night time hand-to-hand combat, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. The enemy forces in the Dambaton area are trying to creep forward under cover. The Japanese garrison has repelled parts of them since the 19th. The results of the battles on July 30th and August 2nd include approximately 100 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, five tents destroyed, and one stockpile of supplies destroyed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Army Losses Exceed One Million</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Washington dispatch states that the U.S. War Department announced on the 2nd that U.S. military losses since the start of the war are as follows: 249,367 killed in action, 644,498 wounded, 46,285 missing in action, 121,498 captured, totaling 1,061,648.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Various Parts of East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The war situation in various areas this week is as follows:</p>
<p>Naval Forces: Since July 10th, enemy naval forces have continued operations in the Iwo Jima and Okinawa areas for about a month. Until July 30th, they carried out aerial operations against Kanto and Kinai with 1,000 aircraft. Small groups of warships echoed this, bombarding Hamamatsu on the 30th and Shimizu on the 31st. Furthermore, enemy submarines also began naval bombardment on land towards Sakhalin and Hokkaido. The Japanese forces are conserving strength and conducting counterattacks with anti-aircraft fire and parts of the air defense forces. So far this week, a total of 146 enemy small aircraft have been shot down and 198 destroyed. At the same time, Japanese submarine forces are also active in the central and southern Pacific Ocean, recently sinking several enemy battleships and transport ships.</p>
<p>Okinawa Area: Enemy forces in the Okinawa area are currently focused on strengthening their base. They seem to have about 600 B-24 aircraft in that area. Recently, there have been very few transport ships in that area, probably because they are too busy strengthening ground facilities to spare resources for resupplying base materials. Furthermore, a combined formation of approximately 300 B-24s, B-25s, and fighters from that area attacked the Kyushu area the other day, but their actions were extremely slow due to a typhoon.</p>
<p>Mariana Islands: The U.S. military claims that they will announce attack targets in advance when attacking Japanese small and medium-sized cities, intending to disrupt Japanese morale. The indiscriminate bombing with incendiary bombs at night continues to be carried out, and bombs are dropped exclusively on surviving factories. Approximately 20,000 large B-24 and B-29 aircraft have attacked from that area, a significant increase compared to the 5,000 last month. The reason is that among the aircraft that attacked in July, as many as 8,000 were enemy carrier-based aircraft.</p>
<p>Burma Area: The Japanese army is using the key points of the Pegu mountain range to contain the enemy for a long time, posing a major threat to enemy supply lines such as the Yangon-Mandalay highway and the Yangon-Kyoukse highway, preventing the U.S. military from having smooth logistics. The Japanese army is in close contact with friendly forces operating across the Sitang River, inflicting great blows on the enemy. Currently, they are gradually preparing for the shallow water battles on the east bank of the Sitang River.</p>
<p>Bougainville: The Japanese army is currently fighting bravely. In the Mirao and central Numai areas, Japanese forces are inflicting great damage on the enemy with clever counterattacks. Since mid-July, Japanese forces have killed or wounded 539 enemy soldiers and destroyed more than 20 vehicles in the Mirao River area. Furthermore, between July 1st and 18th, 70 enemy soldiers were killed in the Numai area. Enemy forces on Buka Island, north of the island, have recently begun to stir, sending out scout teams to try to infiltrate Japanese positions. The Japanese army ambushes troops in various places, taking the opportunity to kill the enemy and disrupt the enemy's rear. In recent days, dozens of enemy soldiers have been killed.</p>
<h3>Babbitt Discusses the Pacific War: Ending Will Still Take Time</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch: General Babbitt, commander of the U.S. Tenth Air Force, who was recently transferred from India to the Chinese front, arrived in Kunming in early July. When interviewed by a Central News Agency reporter regarding the issue of supplying the Chinese war effort, he stated the following: Whether the United States will transport a large number of aircraft to Chongqing depends on the American supply capabilities.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Outcome of the Three-Headed Conference</h3>
<p>The Berlin Conference of the leaders of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has been the focus of international attention, as it is believed to have a major impact on the future world situation. At the same time, because the conference was held at the time when the European War had ended, and most of the postwar issues related to Europe had been decided at the Crimea Conference and the San Francisco Conference, people generally assumed that this three-headed conference must have discussed the East Asian problem. Some people even said that the conference focused on the East Asian problem. Of course, this inference is not just speculation, but has a considerable factual basis. Combining the reports from the British and American sides before the conference, it can be clearly seen that the British and American authorities have done everything possible to jointly urge the Soviet Union to participate in the war against Japan.</p>
<p>However, the Three-Headed Conference held formal meetings 13 times from July 17 to August 2, and issued a communiqué in the three capitals on August 3. Looking at the content, it can be seen that this Three-Headed Conference still focused on the punishment of Germany and postwar problems in Europe, and did not establish any complete decision on the East Asian problem. This is a great failure for the British and American sides. The attempt and activities to provoke conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union have once again been thoroughly defeated. In order to avoid the blame from the people, Truman announced the reasons for making concessions to the Soviet Union before returning home, which shows how depressed he was in his heart!</p>
<p>The failure of Britain and the United States in the three-headed conference was not accidental. First of all, of course, the Soviet Union contributed the most and sacrificed the most in this European war, so its position in speaking out has improved. Secondly, it is obvious that Truman is not comparable to Roosevelt in diplomacy, and he is not Stalin's strong rival. Thirdly, the Conservative Party's failure in the British general election and Churchill's subsequent withdrawal from the conference halfway through made Stalin even more dominant. In addition, two more points can be noted: one is that the entire Soviet Union, as Soviet Head of State Kalinin said, has already "left the combat life and is moving towards demobilization, towards peaceful reconstruction and construction life," and will no longer allow itself to be instigated by others to move towards another bloody war; second, the people of Britain and the United States are also full of war-weariness and a desire for peace, especially the failure of the British Conservative Party in the general election and the victory of the Labor Party more fully reflect that people's attention has shifted from foreign to domestic affairs. In this new situation, any conspiracy for a major war will inevitably fail.</p>
<p>Therefore, the fact that the Three-Headed Conference had no concrete decisions on the East Asian problem was not an unexpected result. However, this does not mean that we can be relieved of concerns about new enemy maneuvers. Because the British and American ambitions to dominate the Far East are inseparable from the British and American imperialist system. Unless the British and American authorities decide to abandon their imperialist policies, any British and American leaders will continue to wage war to preserve their colonies and special interests in the Far East. In order to persist in the war, they will try every means to create a new environment that is unfavorable to Japan and East Asia. What's more, the Three-Headed Conference also issued a joint declaration by the British, American, and Soviet representatives, calling for Japan's unconditional surrender. The Three-Headed Conference also decided to convene a five-nation foreign ministers' conference in London before September 1. Although the task of this five-nation council is mainly to deal with European and general international issues, it is hard to guarantee that Britain and the United States will not carry out other maneuvers during this period.</p>
<p>The failure of the British and American provocation of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union in the Three-Headed Conference makes us more determined in our belief that East Asians will solve East Asian problems and build East Asia for East Asians. The general trend of the world is increasingly favorable to this, and we should follow the established national policy, move forward bravely, and achieve the purpose of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Airlift Supplies</h3>
<p>In order to shorten the war, the United States is conducting an air transport campaign to China to the maximum extent. Although many ports along the coast have been restored, air transport is still an important means of supply, especially in China, where transportation is inconvenient. Mr. Babbitt also strongly stated that the prospects of the Pacific War must continue to be fought hard for a year or two before it can end.</p>
<h3>Pipeline Construction Workers Strike</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing: U.S. military commander in Chongqing, General Wedemeyer, stated on the 3rd on the issue of lending weapons to the Chongqing army under U.S. military training that the construction workers of the India-Chongqing pipeline, which is extremely important to this issue, have recently gone on strike collectively, resulting in unfavorable progress in construction. He added that certain military supplies will also no longer be transported to Chongqing, and countermeasures are currently being considered.</p>
<h3>One U.S. Submarine Sunk</h3>
<p>Frontline Aviation Base, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At approximately 10:13 AM on the morning of the 4th, Japanese air force units discovered a U.S. submarine on the sea surface southeast of Cape Inubozaki, and launched a fierce attack, machine-gunning it. Numerous shots hit the bridge and the front of the ship. The enemy submarine then suddenly emitted flames and smoke and quickly submerged. Then, a loud explosion was heard, and the ship submerged even deeper. At around 4:00 PM, Japanese reconnaissance confirmed that there were many long oil slicks and pieces of wood floating on the nearby sea surface. Therefore, the sinking of the submarine has been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang in the Past Two Months (2)</h3>
<p>— Bo Ying</p>
<h3>Epidemic Prevention and Hygiene</h3>
<p>It is now summer, and epidemics are prone to raging, which has a major impact on society. The provincial government attaches great importance to this, and in order to plan ahead, the Zhejiang Provincial Epidemic Prevention Committee has been established to be responsible for promoting epidemic prevention work in Zhejiang Province. Personnel were sent to Shanghai to purchase a large number of vaccines and transport them to Hangzhou, and distributed them to the Hangzhou Municipal Government and various county governments to implement vaccinations. An epidemic hospital was also planned to be built in Liangzhe Mountain. Other provincial hospitals related to health have also been strengthened and improved to meet the needs of the people.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Management of Local Products</h3>
<p>Zhejiang's local products have always been known to be abundant, selling to various parts of Southeast China and as far as North China. They are a major source of wealth for Zhejiang Province. After the incident, due to transportation issues, the transportation of materials has gradually returned to the smoothness of the past. Mr. Ding is deeply concerned about the movement of materials. In order to develop Zhejiang's resources and encourage the transportation and sale of Zhejiang's local products to various places, he has strengthened management. Starting on June 1, four local products, including medicinal materials, porcelain, mountain goods, and straw mats, will be managed by the Zhejiang Provincial Local Products Management and Handling Department. Starting on July 1, consultation with the Allied forces will resume regarding military-related oils and fats and other raw materials, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, bamboo, wood, firewood, meat, and vegetables. Six types of local products, including categories, are also managed by the office. The circulation of local products and materials in Zhejiang Province will become smoother due to management, which will benefit the people's economy to a significant extent.</p>
<h3>Promoting Agriculture</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is now in a decisive phase. It is an urgent task for our country to implement agricultural development. When Provincial Governor Ding took office, it was the time when locusts were about to rise and cause harm. In order to protect farmers' produce, he strictly ordered all counties to implement locust control measures to prevent locusts from harming rural areas. Given that there are many gaps along the railway line that are wasted, he ordered the counties along the railway to earnestly encourage the public to use the gaps along the railway line to plant miscellaneous grains, in order to increase agricultural production. Specialist technicians are sent to provide guidance at any time, and considerable results have been achieved. Also, beekeeping is a common side job for farmers. He ordered the counties of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Pinghu to encourage people to raise bees and protect the bee houses that have been constructed. In order to promote agricultural production, the various agricultural institutions under the Zhejiang Provincial Government were adjusted. For example, the Provincial First Agricultural Experimental Field was renamed the Hangzhou Agricultural Farm, the Provincial Nursery was renamed the Hangzhou Nursery. Other provincial Second Agricultural Experimental Fields are revoked and handed over to the Jiaxing County Government for safekeeping. A technical office was established within the Department of Construction to be responsible for planning facilities for increasing agricultural production in order to achieve practical results. The office is currently planning to cultivate 400 acres of farmland in the counties under Hangzhou's jurisdiction, and the rest of the counties will hand over the cultivation to the local cooperatives.</p>
<h3>Building Highways</h3>
<p>Zhejiang's highways have always been very developed. Since the incident, they have been damaged by the war, resulting in either the entire highway being unable to be traversed, or even if it is possible to drive on them, it is not smooth. Transportation is severely hindered, and travel is extremely painful. Mr. Ding believes that highways are extremely important to people's lives, economy, and transportation, and he has strengthened the highway institutions, changing the original Highway Management Office into the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau. He also serves as the director of the bureau to promote the effort with determination. At the same time, four highway management offices have been established: Hangzhou-Fu, Hangzhou-Shan, Hangzhou-Yu, and Hangzhou-Wu, to handle road protection, road maintenance, and related management matters. Highways that are currently being repaired include the Hangzhou-Fu Highway, Hangzhou-Yu Highway, Hangzhou-Shan Highway, Hangzhou-Wu Highway, and the Zhejiang section of the Sujia Highway. The Hangzhou-Shaoxing Highway, Shaoxing-Zheng Highway, and other roads are also being planned for repairs. The initial construction cost reaches 50 million yuan. If they can all be completed, Zhejiang's transportation can be restored to the heyday before the incident.</p>
<h3>Rectifying Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>In recent years, water traffic has been blocked, so merchants and people's goods cannot be delivered smoothly, and people feel deeply pained. The water conservancy in Zhejiang Province has not been repaired for a long time, which not only affects irrigation for farmers, but also hinders transportation. After Governor Ding took office, he actively engaged in rectifying water conservancy in the province. In terms of institutions, the original Zhejiang Tanggong Water Conservancy Bureau was abolished, and the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau was established separately. The Director of the Department of Construction, Lin, was appointed to concurrently serve as the director, responsible for sorting out the water conservancy business in Zhejiang Province. Currently, he is planning to dredge the Xiatang River in Hangzhou County, Puyang River, and Xiaoshan Xianghu, etc. Once the plan is completed, the dredging work can be implemented. Other rivers will also be constructed in stages. The Zhejiang Tanggong Supervision Office has also been established, and merchants have been recruited to repair the ruined seawall outside the South Gate of Haining with the "Hao, Jue, Zi, Du" numbers. Construction has now started and is expected to be completed after the autumn floods. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japanese Maritime Warriors Organize Volunteer Rescue Teams for Ships in Distress; Navy Ministry Issued Order Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Navy Ministry issued an order on the 5th that maritime warriors who bravely rescue ships under the threat of enemy aircraft and submarines will jointly organize volunteer combat teams for ship rescue. The members of the combat team include the ship rescue industry, shipwreck salvage industry, ship demolition industry, divers, and supervisors. In order to encourage their morale and ensure they complete their duties, they are granted the same qualifications as soldiers.</p>
<h3>Governor Ye Discusses the Overall Situation of Governance in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>General Ye [blank space], Governor of Hubei Province and Director of Pacification in Wuhan, arrived in Nanjing from Wuhan a few days ago to meet with Acting Chairman Chen to report on his work and request instructions. A Central News Agency reporter, in order to understand the current situation of governance in Hubei Province, visited him yesterday. The following is a summary of his answers: (Question) Since your Excellency took office as Governor, what improvements have been made to the governance of Hubei Province? (Answer) After being ordered to govern Hubei, my sole purpose has been to stabilize people's livelihoods and cleanse officialdom. After my arrival in Wuhan, the prices of goods in Wuhan were equivalent to those in Nanjing. However, after the provincial government took action, the prices of goods in Wuhan are now about 10% lower than those in the capital, and people's lives can be stable and worry-free. As for cleansing officialdom, I started by improving the military and police, guaranteeing the salaries of civil servants to stabilize their lives, and then strictly legislating laws and regulations, based on the principles of "nurturing life" and "nurturing integrity." Any civil servant who is not honest will be severely punished according to the "Regulations on Punishing Civil Servants for Embezzlement." (Question) Recently, enemy planes have frequently bombed Wuhan. What plans does the Governor have for the city? (Answer) Pained to see Hubei Province attacked by enemy planes, I convened a fundraising conference in Shanghai and other places, raising huge sums of money to provide relief to disaster victims, improve air defense facilities, and request the central government to issue Wuhan Reconstruction Public Bonds to rebuild the city and restore factories, in order to quickly restore the city of Hankou. (Question) Since your Excellency took office as Governor of Hubei, what are your impressions? (Answer) After arriving in Wuhan, I observed that the spirit of the people is extremely uplifted. They have a considerable understanding of China's wartime environment. In particular, the allied authorities in Wuhan have spared no effort in assisting Wuhan's governance. Local friendly forces have provided even more support. On behalf of all the people of Hubei, I express my deep gratitude for this.</p>
<h3>Allied Press Reporter Comments on the Three-Power Declaration</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Regarding the Potsdam Conference, a reporter from the Japanese Allied Press, He Shangyong, broadcast a commentary in Tokyo on the evening of the 3rd, criticizing the conference as a victory for the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet Union could now handle Germany more boldly. The main points are as follows: The Potsdam Conference communiqué is merely an appendix to the Yalta Communiqué. The difficult issues concerning the future of Germany, such as the Rhineland, Ruhr, and food supply, have not been resolved. The consistency of governance methods is only dealt with by the phrase "to the extent possible in practice." The results of the conference are all boilerplate language, and it is difficult to find a single phrase or sentence of free idealism. The joint statement is actually just to appease American and British public opinion, which demanded that the Soviet Union fight against Japan.</p>
<h3>Laval Defends Himself, Denies Military Cooperation with Germany; Petain Requests Rescheduling of Trial</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency telegram) According to dispatches from Paris: Former Vichy government leader Laval appeared as a witness during the twelfth interrogation of Marshal Petain yesterday, vehemently defending his past policies with the phrase "it had to be done this way." When the court asked him how he obtained thousands of French workers to supply Hitler's wartime production, he argued, "This move was also out of necessity. I exchanged 300,000 French laborers for 100,000 prisoners of war. What is wrong with that? At that time, Belgium had established a government under Zhu, and had to supply 80% of the country's labor force to Germany, while France, because it had a government, only supplied 18% of the country's labor force to Germany." At the same time, he vehemently denied that Petain had telegraphed Hitler when the Allies attacked Dieppe, seeking French troops to help Germany repel the Allied attacks or landings. Laval claimed, "I strongly opposed any military cooperation with Germany." However, Petain's defense lawyers insisted that the telegram was not sent by Petain, but that Petain only signed it. Therefore, when the telegram was sent from the Vichy government, it was noted "Petain signed." When the court asked about North Africa, Laval claimed, "This is General Darlan's business, and has nothing to do with me. He ordered the French army to resist and repel any attack from any side, so the French army clashed with the Allied forces." When the prosecutor asked about the issue of handing over Jews to Germany, Laval replied, "I restored the nationality of the Jews." At this time, Marshal Petain suddenly requested that the court reschedule the trial, as he was exhausted. Thus, the trial was interrupted again.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Tatar Strait Issue Reach Impasse; Turkey Refuses Territorial Concessions to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency telegram) According to news from London, the joint communiqué issued by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union after the Potsdam Conference made no mention of the future of the Tatar Strait, indicating that the new treaty of friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey has reached an impasse. Although no authoritative sources have released information, reliable sources report that the Soviet-Turkish negotiations, which began in early summer, have not yet yielded results and were suddenly interrupted a few weeks ago, because the Turkish government has refused to make territorial concessions to the Soviet Union. Moreover, it issued a statement a few days ago, stating, "The Soviet government's proposal to revise the regulations of the Tatar Strait should not exclude other countries with vested interests, and should not be decided unilaterally by the Soviet Union and Turkey." Currently, diplomatic circles in London believe that the success or failure of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations depends on whether the major powers can reach a proper agreement on the Tatar Strait issue.</p>
<h3>Nehru Advocates Building a "South Asian Federation"</h3>
<p>Bailleron, 5th (Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>According to news from Kashmir, Indian Congress leader Nehru stated at a meeting of the Kashmir National Conference (a pro-Congress meeting in India) that he wanted to organize a "South Asian Federation," including India, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, Burma, and Ceylon. He claimed, "Our Indian Congress has always opposed dividing India into several small groups. Currently, for economic policies and national defense plans, we hope that India can become a unified home, because all small countries have lost their place in the world of tomorrow. The so-called small countries are actually satellites of the moon, and are nothing more than hunting grounds for big countries. If India is divided again today, it will inevitably perish. In today's world, there are two great powers, ×× and the United States. In the world of tomorrow, two great powers will be added, namely India and China. There will definitely be no fifth great power."</p>

<h3>20th Air Defense Day: Implementing Baojia Training; Each Lianbao to Use Bicycles for Messaging</h3>
<p>The 9th of this month is the 20th Air Defense Day. In addition to expanding publicity on air defense awareness as usual, the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters will change the methods of air defense training. Taking each police station as a unit, it will implement a general mobilization training for the police officers of each station. Under the command of the station chief, various comprehensive air defense trainings will be carried out. The first section will manage liaison and other businesses, the second section will be responsible for security, rescue, firefighting, and fire prevention, the third section will be responsible for verifying deaths and investigating damage, and the fourth section will be responsible for collecting information, providing first aid, relief, and Baojia affairs.</p>
<p>Mobilizing Baojia</p>
<p>At the same time, a general mobilization training of Baojia will be implemented. Each air defense district will take its sub-district Lianbao as a unit to carry out initial training in fire prevention, shelter, and first aid, as well as communication and bicycle messaging. The Baojia mobilization training units will establish liaison offices at simulated disaster sites to command and control relief affairs. At the same time, they will communicate with the various sub-bureaus and the air defense section through communications and bicycle messengers. Therefore, each Lianbao unit should organize a Baojia bicycle messenger team to be responsible for liaison between the simulated disaster site and the sub-bureau. Each sub-bureau will organize a police bicycle messenger team to be responsible for communication between the headquarters (air defense section) and the sub-bureau.</p>
<p>Messenger Training</p>
<p>The police bicycle messenger training for the headquarters and sub-bureaus is temporarily scheduled for the following seventeen sub-bureaus: Huangpu, Lao Zha, Xin Cheng, Jing'an Temple, Jiangning Road, Putuo Road, Hongkou, West Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Yulin Road, Yangshupu, Taishan, Lujiawan, Changshu Road, Huashan, and Changning Road. Detailed measures for various trainings such as light control and traffic control will be announced in the coming days. However, regional comprehensive trainings will be temporarily suspended from this session onwards.</p>
<h3>Houses Damaged by Air Raids Should Be Prevented from Collapsing to Avoid Casualties</h3>
<p>On the 27th of last month, a two-bay building at 63 Jiangxi Road in the Central District suddenly collapsed at the front of the building. The cause of the collapse was found to be the shock caused by a previous air raid. Fortunately, the Construction Bureau discovered it early and prevented traffic, preventing injuries. According to a spokesman for the authorities, in the future, in the event of an air raid, the Construction Bureau has instructed special attention to be paid to houses damaged by the shock. However, the urban area is vast and it is difficult to keep a close watch on everything. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention at all times and assist in identifying problems. Once discovered, they should immediately report to the nearest police station and the Construction Bureau so that preventive measures can be taken in time to avoid accidents. At the same time, old and dilapidated houses that have not been repaired for a long time should be repaired properly to reduce the risk of collapse and ensure public safety.</p>
<h3>Dispersed Individuals Applying for Cash: Processing Begins Today</h3>
<p>In order to eliminate the malpractice of discounts and convenience citizens who are dispersed returning to their hometowns, the Central Reserve Bank will hold applications for cash and remittances for those dispersed returning to their hometowns at its West District and South District offices starting today (6th). Anyone who is dispersed and returning to their hometowns can prepare a Baojia movement certificate or a certificate from a dispersal agency, certified by the Baojia section of the relevant police station, and with a special guarantee from the bank, and apply to the two offices for cash or remittance. The application for cash is limited to one million yuan per person, and the remittance is limited to two million yuan per person.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Luo Donates Gold Watch for Air Defense and Disaster Relief Expenses</h3>
<p>Since the city has been repeatedly attacked by enemy planes, many innocent civilians have been killed and injured. Enthusiastic people from all walks of life have donated money or medical supplies for relief. It has been learned that Secretary-General Luo of the Municipal Government specially donated his personal gold watch to the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters yesterday to supplement the city's air defense and disaster relief expenses. After Director Noguchi of the department personally accepted it, he made a brief statement to the city's press, saying that Secretary-General Luo has always been as fond of the people as he is of his own children. After the recent air raids, he personally went to the disaster areas several times to comfort the victims. This time, he donated a gold watch to use its value for future disaster relief expenses. This kind of benevolent spirit is truly moving to the department. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will follow in the footsteps of Secretary-General Luo and enthusiastically contribute, so that even small contributions can make a big difference, and the beneficiaries of the disaster victims will definitely be significant.</p>
<h3>Recording Residence Permit Numbers to Prevent Loss</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has recently found that citizens in the urban area often lose their residence permits. It has been found that the authorities must go through a serious process before reissuing these documents. It is hoped that residents in the urban area will record the numbers of their residence permits at any time so that they can be checked in the event of a loss, so as to facilitate processing.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper's New and Old Aid-to-Study Students Held Screening Examination Yesterday; Over 5,000 Candidates with Good Order</h3>
<p>The screening examination for the ninth session of this newspaper's reader aid-to-study fund for new and old students was held at Datong University on Xinzha Road yesterday morning and afternoon. A total of about 5,000 students from universities, colleges, high schools, junior high schools, and elementary schools took the examination. They were able to arrive at the venue early to take the examination. From this city, there were residents from Pudong, Hudong, and various districts of Huaxi Fahua who rushed to the venue in the morning. Students returning to their hometowns for the summer vacation also returned to Shanghai in advance to participate in the screening test after seeing the report. Therefore, the number of absentees was very small. From this, it can be seen that the eagerness of poor students to learn is commendable. The two examination sessions were divided into more than 20 classrooms, adopting a mixed system, that is, students of all sizes were seated together, and the order was orderly. In the afternoon, it rained, and a breeze came, making it feel cooler. At four o'clock, the second examination session, for university colleges and junior high school first and second grades, was seated according to the number, listening quietly to the examiner's instructions, each relying on their test questions, pondering hard, and answering one by one, and were able to hand in the papers on time. Overall, the entire process of the two examination sessions yesterday was very good. Datong University is located in the west district, quiet in the bustling area, with fresh air, and the school buildings are magnificent and well-lit. We are very grateful for the willingness to borrow it. Yesterday, more than 40 teachers from Datong Affiliated High School, Municipal Elementary School, and this newspaper's voluntary elementary school served as proctors, enthusiastically supported, and guided well. The colleagues of this newspaper express their infinite gratitude.</p>

In the first game, Jiangsu team lost to Guangdong by three to one. In the second game, Zhejiang team defeated Guangdong team by three to one.

Wang Youxin worked hard to counterattack and won three consecutive games, totaling three to one, and Fu Qifang suffered a terrible defeat. In the second group, Zhejiang's main player Lu Hanjun faced Jiangsu's Xue Xuchu.

<h3>The Origin of August 8th Father's Day</h3>
<p>Prominent figures in this city have initiated the establishment of August 8th as Father's Day. The origin is as follows: "Recalling that when the First European War ended, Ms. Jarvis of the United States initiated Mother's Day to console the mothers of those killed in action. Subsequently, enlightened individuals in various countries actively promoted it, transforming it into a day to commemorate one's own mother. There is no difference in this sentiment across all places and times. However, the father gives birth to me, nurtures me. Zhang Hengqu inscribed the grace of Father Heaven and Mother Earth, and Liu Jizhai recorded the virtue of his father's worries and his mother's hardships. Father and mother should be mentioned and valued equally. Knowing the father but not knowing the mother is a loss of basic human emotions. Knowing the mother but not knowing the father is a painful matter. We, the undersigned, considering the conclusion of this Second European War, were reminded and initiated Father's Day, designating August 8th of each year to be observed respectfully, hence also called the 'Double Eighth Festival.' The two 'eights' connected resemble the character '父' (father) in shape, and its pronunciation is similar to '爸爸' (baba, dad). Considering the name and its meaning, it aids in remembrance. The ceremony imitates the precedent of Mother's Day. All children wear flowers in remembrance. Those whose fathers are alive wear a red flower, and those whose fathers have passed away wear a white flower. Showing love and respect, the red love shines brightly forever. Grief over the loss of a father, the honorable family tradition remains. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have children? The wind arises upon hearing this, surely it evokes sympathy. It is hoped that social progressives will advocate and promote it, from one family to one village, to one county, to one province, to one country, and to the entire world. Repaying kindness and respecting parents, near and far, should be one. This is what we hope and pray for day and night. This is the beginning.</p>
<p>Initiators: (Names in order of stroke count) Shi Zhifu, Yuan Xilian, Zhang Yiqu, Mei Lanfang, Lu Ganchen, Chen Qingshi, Fu Wenshou, Fei Mu, Gu Huiquing, Yan Duhe."</p>

<h3>Several Necessary Measures Under Air Raids</h3>
<p>— Shizhou</p>
<p>Since July 17th, this city has been subjected to four consecutive air raids by American planes. The scale is far greater than in the past. The central, eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern districts have been indiscriminately bombed. Many civilian houses have collapsed, and the number of civilian deaths and injuries has reached several thousands. In the future, American planes will undoubtedly continue to attack. Under this severe threat, it is hoped that all necessary measures that can promote the safety of citizens can be completed in the shortest possible time. The following points are suggested to the relevant parties to take immediate and swift action to implement them.</p>
<p>Order all major buildings and relatively strong public places in the city to accommodate as many pedestrians seeking refuge as possible after the air raid alarm is issued. Closing the doors is prohibited. Special self-defense teams should be organized on the second floor and above to guard against criminals mixing in and causing trouble. Violators will be punished.</p>
<p>Reiterate the previous order that all shops and residences along the roads should re-apply strong paper strips in a crisscross pattern. Shops with row of planks should immediately install row of planks after the air raid alarm is issued to prevent flying debris from shattering the glass, increasing the number of injured pedestrians.</p>
<p>The air raid shelters dug along the streets in this city are often filled with garbage and stagnant water. Once they are officially needed, citizens will inevitably be near the trenches and unable to escape. Therefore, the authorities should quickly order the workers to be responsible for cleaning up the trenches and complete the work as soon as possible within the specified time limit to facilitate temporary emergency use.</p>
<p>Encourage evacuation and provide affordable and convenient access for citizens leaving Shanghai. Stipulate that all Shanghai residents who evacuate and leave Shanghai can obtain a certificate from the local Baojia authorities and purchase train and ship tickets with a travel agency draft. The draft can be guaranteed by a familiar business or organization before the passenger leaves Shanghai.</p>
<p>Guide citizens in some areas who are unable to relocate to organize special air defense and rescue teams as soon as possible, and provide essential medical supplies such as cotton, gauze, bandages, red medicine, diluted iodine tincture, etc., at low prices. The items are stored and managed by the Baojia authorities, who will send personnel or convene trainings on their use at any time. If they are not needed, all of them should be returned to the authorities at the original price.</p>
<p>With the promotion of the municipal authorities, a broad rescue system should be organized jointly by the city's major hospitals and transportation automobile associations. Each district should respond to each other. If an accident occurs in one district, the nearby agreed districts should automatically come to assist so that the injured can receive immediate treatment in the shortest possible time without worrying about the injuries worsening or even dying innocently due to prolonged time.</p>
<p>Give special preference to the affected people. All affected people who hold a travel agency draft and obtain a written certificate from the nearby Baojia authorities may go to the Central Reserve Bank or the designated agent bank of the Central Reserve Bank within three days of the incident to exchange the draft for cash at full value to provide emergency expenses for the affected people after the disaster. The Central Reserve Bank is responsible for providing the cash, but the amount of exchange should be specified, with a maximum of $500,000 in principle. Additional amounts may be requested for special circumstances.</p>
<h3>Those Evacuating by Vehicle Should Advance the Ticket Check-in Time</h3>
<p>— Wu Zemin</p>
<p>Recently, air raids have been frequent, and citizens are automatically evacuating. However, transportation by ships is inconvenient at present, and 19 of them have switched to railways to transfer. Therefore, train passengers are very crowded. At this time, the work of China Railway employees is the same as in the past. There are no emergency measures in special times to assist the authorities in the evacuation plan. For example, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line early train departs at 7:30, and the ticket office often starts checking tickets as late as 7:15. Excuse me, how many passengers can be admitted in this short 15 minutes, so those who are behind cannot get on the bus, and the ticket is invalidated. Three of my relatives and friends have encountered this. Please imagine that evacuees at this time when train tickets are rising in price and difficult to purchase cannot withstand such a blow in terms of mental or economic aspects. So hope</p>
<p>Those with tickets must find a way to get on the train. In case of excessive crowding, priority is given to changing to the next train, and the ticket is still valid, without any stamping procedures, so as to avoid inconvenience.</p>
<p>The station gate is opened at 6:00 in the morning for passengers to enter. After entering the gate at the ticket office, there is no need to queue up again. You can go to the ticket office at any time and directly enter the gate to get on the bus or wait for the bus.</p>
<p>If the above methods can be implemented, those with tickets will not be unable to get on the bus due to the short ticket check-in time, and the order of the station must be better.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities in This City Should Be Jointly Controlled by the Government and the People</h3>
<p>— Mu Yun</p>
<p>Shanghai's public utilities—including electricity, trams, telephones, tap water, and gas—were managed by the municipal authorities in terms of fees and administration before the war. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, various public utilities have been placed under military control. It was not until July of last year that military control was lifted and operated by various companies in Central China. There are other institutions to review the fees and administration, which are not subject to the control of the municipal government.</p>
<p>Recently, due to soaring prices, public utilities have also adjusted prices and increased deposits. In total, there have been as many as three times in the seven months of this year, each time as high as two or three times. As for the service, the insolent attitude of the staff, the low efficiency of the service, the improper restrictions, and the slow repairs are all facts that everyone sees. Recently, due to the issue of bill discounting, various companies have also refused to accept checks. Although some of it can be said to be unavoidable during the war, most of it is due to poor human planning.</p>
<p>We are not opposed to raising prices to maintain war work life or soaring materials, but we want to know whether the application is reasonable in terms of operation. For example, in terms of materials, whether there is any waste, in terms of funds, whether the distribution is appropriate, in terms of personnel, whether the handling is appropriate, and whether the restrictions are reasonable.</p>
<p>The relationship between public utilities and citizens is no less than that between the municipal government and the people; on the contrary, because citizens rely on public utilities such as water and electricity for their daily needs, their relationship is closer than that of the municipal government. Therefore, we advocate that public utilities should be controlled by the municipal government or organizations organized by citizens, such as the Municipal Advisory Committee. At the very least, in the midst of the municipal government's efforts to eliminate corruption and increase administrative efficiency, we hope that the authorities of public utilities will pay attention to whether the actions of their staff are law-abiding, honest and loving, and whether there are any violations, then the people of the city will benefit a lot.</p>
<h3>Use the Peace Shrine Base to Rebuild a Monument</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>August 1st of this year is the second anniversary of the takeover of the concessions. I remember that during the one-week anniversary last year, the Municipal Standing Committee held a groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of a monument on the Bund of Nanjing Road, but it has not started construction after a year. Naturally, the funds and materials have become problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, I respectfully suggest to the municipal authorities and the Municipal Advisory Committee: Please stop building the monument pavilion and use the base of the Peace Shrine on the Bund of Dasha Hai Road to build a monument. All the surrounding area can be engraved with commemorative texts, which is magnificent and long-lasting, and at the same time can save defense power and manpower.</p>
<p>It is not unprecedented to renovate and utilize buildings. For example, the monument built in Beiping during the Gengzi Eight-Power Allied Forces to commemorate the German minister who was killed was later rebuilt as the Allied Victory Monument of the First European War. The anniversary monument built by the Restoration Government on Zhongshan North Road in Nanjing was also changed to the Greater East Asia War Memorial. I hope that the municipal authorities will adopt these humble opinions, then I will be very grateful.</p>
<h3>Several Hotels as Hospitals for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>— Riyong</p>
<p>Someone suggested on July 20th that the country 　舞　廳 should be changed to a hospital for disaster victims, which is very good. However, I think it is better to change the hotel to a hospital for disaster victims than to change the dance hall to a hospital for disaster victims. Because the hospital must have bed equipment, the dance hall does not have this equipment, so I advocate that it is more appropriate to change the hotel into a hospital for disaster victims.</p>
<p>Speaking of Shanghai's hotels, they have long lost the original intention of "housing businessmen" and have become the source of all evils. You see, prostitution, gambling, opium, and other crimes, don't they all happen in hotels? So, changing Shanghai's hotels into hospitals for disaster victims will not only bring infinite benefits to the disaster-stricken people, but also make Shanghai's prostitution, gambling, opium and other crimes lose their base, at least making Shanghai's society can get some time of tranquility and peace, who dares to say it is inappropriate!</p>
<p>In addition, the tea servants in the hotel are originally doing the work of serving and serving. It is not good to make them unemployed one day. If they are changed to hospitals for disaster victims, they can do the work of serving patients, and they can not lose their jobs. At the same time, they were originally doing humble servants' work, and now they are changed to the sacred work of serving patients. Isn't it increasing their status and personality?</p>
<p>I am not helping the zao dance hall. Under today's circumstances, the dance hall is just a sales place for upstarts and has no benefits to the society at all, but his sins seem to be smaller than the hotels. Because he does not have equipment that can be used as a hospital, so I suggest that it might as well be changed to a refugee shelter. I hope that the social people will unite to promote the realization of my proposal, then the society is fortunate!</p>
