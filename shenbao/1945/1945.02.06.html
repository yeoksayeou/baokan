<h3>馬尼剌地區激戰　日陸海軍邀擊中　波多羅島日軍作肉搏攻擊</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地五日中央社電　自聖法南多方面南下之敵軍，至三日逐漸迫近馬尼刺北郊，對馬尼刺地區加以猛烈之砲擊後，至三日下午五時左右，敵之一部份自北部突入馬尼刺市內，日軍刻正於聖多馬斯大學邀擊敵軍突入部隊，而展開激戰中。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地五日中央社電　日軍馬尼刺防衛部隊，對敵軍之突入馬尼刺，當即奮起邀擊，目下正以聖多馬斯大學附近爲中心，展開激戰中。使敵蒙受損害極大，但發電廠因敵軍砲擊及轟炸，已被破壞，故馬尼刺市內自三日以來已化爲黑暗都市，日美兩軍於市內北部，正反復展開壯烈之戰鬥。敵軍並由巴打雁州以空海軍增援部隊漸次向馬尼刺南部迫近，然日軍正於各處阻止敵軍北進，而與之激戰中。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地五日中央社電　日陸海軍刻正邀擊侵入馬尼刺地區之敵軍，而到處對之展開攻擊，並予敵極大之損害。又日軍特別陸戰隊，三日於馬尼刺郊外邀擊敵軍，加以猛烈之反擊後，予敵以重創，現經判明陸海部隊收獲之戰果如次：殺傷敵兵一千六百以上，擊毀起火者計有敵戰車十七輛，運輸汽車二十六輛以上，火砲二十四門以上。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地五日中央社電　敵軍爲與呂宋島作戰相呼應，最近對菲律賓之中部及南部，開始侵入作戰，一月十八日敵復使擁有載車十數輛，二千新兵蘇魯羣島之主島波多羅島登陸，該島西南岸之日守備軍，則連夜實行肉搏攻擊，二十七日全軍結一團，果敢衝入敵陣，予敵以多大損害。迄二十七日，該守備隊共殺敵約三百餘，破壞山砲一尊，永陸兩用戰車三輛，營幕二十一處。敵方於中部菲律賓地區，復欲切斷雷伊泰島與宿霧島之交通，而以魚雷艇巡遊宿霧島沿岸。</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　呂宋島方面，日軍正進行澈底防禦作戰，五日此間每新聞揭載其戰局如次：敵美一意向馬尼刺進攻，並作誇大宣傳，謂菲律賓戰局由於馬尼刺攻略而一變，敵軍經日軍邀擊後，然仍強行侵攻馬尼剌，現僅進抵馬尼刺近郊，即謂該市已被佔領，倘其佔領馬尼刺，必將廣播宣傳菲律賓戰事已結束。然日軍以使美軍出血爲目的，且馬尼刺於軍事上毫無價值，日軍作戰目的，不在土地，不在都市，而在擊滅敵人兵力，故馬尼刺即或化爲戰塲，菲律賓戰事甚至呂宋島戰事，非自此而終，乃實自此而始也。</p>
<h3>民答那峨警隊宣誓捨身衛國</h3>
<p>民答那峨五日中央社電　菲律賓警察隊民答那峨派遣隊，於日美決戰迫近之際，與日軍協力維持治安，供給勞力，孜孜不息，最近爲表示至誠殉國之熱意，於全隊員之血押簽字後，提交菲律賓共和國當局，表示捨身命赴國難之決意。該誓文之大略如次：菲律賓業對美英宜戰，在洛勒爾大總統之指導下，爲大東亞各民族共同之目標而奮鬥，吾等於仰受神明保佑，於茲謹誓忠誠，與美軍交戰，忠實履行職責，必要時不惜以身殉職。</p>
<h3>日閣議決定解散新聞會</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日政府二日閣議中，决定三月一日解散日本新聞會，其解散命令業於四日發出。按日本新聞會自昭和十七年二月五日設立，迄今三載，協力政府之新聞統制工作，仰體政府之意，激揚新聞之公益性。其間爲整頓新聞社，驅除新聞之營業性，而確立新聞共同販賣制，實施新聞記者登錄制等，對於新聞體制之强化貢獻至鉅而達成其所負之使命。頃以政府鑑於目下時局益形重大，爲謀言論暢達之更爲徹底及官民間二位一體起見，對各新開社斷然實施自律之責任體制，俾資打開難局，今後言論指導部，悉由情報局直接管理，至於新聞用紙等資材之配給，共同設施，新聞記者登錄，新聞分派售賣等業務，關於事務，擬使即將於三月一日設立之社團法人日本新聞公社（暫定名稱）擔任，該新聞公社之組織，於日本新聞會解散後，即行正式成立。又前年大東亞新聞會議舉辦之大東亞新聞會議决，於該新聞公社內設置事務所。</p>
<h3>故須賀顧問昨舉行祭禮</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電　五日爲故國府軍事顧問須賀中將殉難四週年紀念日，中日當局特於上午十時半，在雞鳴寺須賀氏墓碑前聯合祭祀，到有國府褚外長民誼，鮑總參謀長一文越，凌海軍部長　，丁社會福利部長默村，周文官長隆庠，張公使超，盟邦到期公使，田中領事，梅崎警備隊司令，後藤總領事館警察署長，松村調查官等數十人，陳代主席屆時亦特親蒞，並領導全體祭祀人員，向須賀氏墓一鞠躬，禮畢，即由華藉僧人四名，日藉僧人三名，誦經超度，繼由陳代主席首先拈香，主祭，其他中日祭祀人員亦輪流祭祀，至十一時餘始吿禮成。</p>
<h3>超高空作戰座談會</h3>
<p>航空决戰，已進展到超高空了在艱苦作戰中的雷伊泰上空，以及敵人飛來轟炸的神州日本本土上簾，空戰全都在超高空進行了，即在六千公尺至八千公尺，或八千公尺至一萬公尺上空進行空戰了。同時近來的空戰，多半都在我們人眼所不能看到的高空進行了。空戰旣有如是之大的變化，而我們日本英勇的飛行員，也克服了急劇的氣象變化。在一萬公尺以上的高空，氣溫達到零下五十五度，面皮凍破，把握推進機的皮手套外面，甚至結冰。飛機的發達，無限地要求高度與速度。現在的航空决戰，業已在一萬公尺的高空進行了。至於成層圈空戰，按飛機優劣决定勝負的時代，想必也不遠了。敵美所自誇的飛行堡壘B二十九型飛機，曾在超高空轟炸日本本土，被驅逐得屁滾尿流，這就是證明日本飛機的優秀性。然而我們不要以此自滿，因爲超高空戰鬥就是生產决戰，爲滿足戰士的要求，今年的最大任務，就是生產更優秀無比的飛機。席不暇暖的保護着神州上空，而與B二十九型拚命的勇士們，向生產方面要求什麼呢？每日新聞社在保護九州北部的某基地制空部隊，召開超高空作戰座談會，以聆取身經百戰勇士們的經騐。同時還有飛機生產方面有力的現狀報吿。</p>
<p>山本少佐：敵美B二十九型飛機在超高空飛來，而開闢了一萬公尺左右的亞成層圈飛行之新决戰塲，這已經成爲全日本國民所關心的題目了。前此戰史上從未有過的决戰塲，在科學領域內也屬於未知範圍內的許多神秘境，全都成爲此次大戰中决勝負的塲所了。爲了爭取航空决戰的勝利，自然就需要使一般民衆瞭解這一神秘性的高空，同時也需要克服許多惡劣條件的高空，而生產優秀的飛機。爲提高這種國民的意志，請諸位隨便談談大家親身與B二十九型在高空作戰的經驗。</p>
<p>記者：所謂超高空，究竟是指多高而言呢？</p>
<p>佐佐大尉：以前稱六千六尺爲超高空，但近來不同了，是稱八千公尺以上爲超高空。這魷是說，比以前高了兩千公尺。這兩千公尺，實在是非同小可。</p>
<p>山本少佐：六千公尺與八千公尺的飛行條件，一定有很大差別吧！</p>
<p>佐佐大尉：差別是很大的。這兩千公尺的變化，實在出乎一般人想像之外。</p>
<p>山本少佐：就是等於兩個富士那樣高。全日本上過富士山頂尖的，或許不到四分之一。對於沒有鳥翼的人類，那眞是令人難以想像的神秘境。</p>
<p>記者：氣溫的差別如何？</p>
<p>小林少佐：一萬公尺的高空是攝氏零下五十一度，所以八千公尺的高空是零下四十二度左右。</p>
<p>山本少佐：是有四五十度上下的差別。</p>
<p>板倉大尉：在緬甸的上空七千公尺上，旣也有三四十度，所以這樣高空，無論熱帶和寒帶都無若何不同。</p>
<p>今井大尉：氣流非常澄淸，毫無塵埃阻礙視綫，屏以在飛機上極目四望，正是豁然開朗，只覺得自已座位傍邊有點發暗。總之，明暗之差，是極爲顯明的。</p>
<p>山本少佐：是與地上的人所想像的明暗程度，大不相同。</p>
<p>小林少佐：在晴天的時候，飛到六千公尺的高空，就可以看見朝鮮。至於對馬，則完看得很淸楚。</p>
<p>小林小佐：在地上可看見山，可看見海，親綫總是有限度的，飛到那樣高的空中時，是茫茫無際的廣闊大空，所以搜索敵人，眞是感覺到像大海撈針一樣。一般人認爲B二十九型飛來時，立刻就可以看得見，這眞是齊東野人之語。或許在大空中感覺到自已渺小所致。</p>
<p>佐佐大尉：因爲沒有對象物，完全失掉了立體感，像在雲霧中來往一樣。所謂雲霧，鑽進空中的雲霧去，魷覺着閃爍發光。完全像散播着的銀砂。</p>
<p>小林少佐：所謂雲，乃是的結晶體。或許稱爲烟霧，更爲恰當。從下面看，完全是雲彩，但飛到那裏面去，反而就不知道是否在雲彩裏面了，只覺得突然視線不佳了。完全是烟霧，因爲千變萬化，實難捉摸，這才眞正感覺到墜於五里霧中。</p>
<p>樫出中尉：一個人昇到超高空中，實在感覺到寂寞，所以往往自言自語。</p>
<p>出中尉：如有一架友機，那也眞够開心的了。</p>
<p>小林少佐：在這個時候，如試放一槍，則心境突變，而不感覺寂寞了</p>
<p>記者：向高空飛，瞬息間溫度就發生變化，那末大家都穿着電熱服麼</p>
<p>小林少佐：將來會使用電熱服的，但直到現在，還沒有使用。大家都還沒發生毛病。</p>
<p>記者：呵！原來還沒有便利電熱服麼？</p>
<p>小林少佐：縱令穿着電熱服，手脚仍然還是冷的。把着推進機的手，感覺着手套的外面結了冰，而內部却很熱，眞有奇妙之感。雖然帶着養氣面罩，但睫毛都結了冰，而眼睛開開都感覺遲鈍了。</p>
<p>佐佐大尉：有時候突然感覺到眼前被蓋上一件東西，而看不見了，這原來是睫毛上滿結了冰。（安譯自一月三日每日新聞）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>享樂主義者的自肅</h3>
<p>一般人的觀念，上海是中國境內的唯一享樂之區，凡是享樂的事業，應有盡有。因此，居住於上海者的心理，也就抱着享樂主義。這種心理的形成，是幾十年來英美帝國主義在租界以內，慢性麻醉的結果。過去有了租界，可以包庇一切犯罪行爲，可以不間國家的事，可以不問社會的事。甚至迫近租界以外的戰事，祗能處身租界，就可高臥了聽砲聲，不受波及，仍可盡情享樂。因此，只顧自私爭利，以圖攫取享樂的資本而已。直到現在，雖然沒有了租界，可是，還有大部分人依然抱着除了盡情享樂以外，一切不顧的觀念。</p>
<p>過去的事姑且不談，大東亞戰爭己逾三年，全世界的大都市（包括敵方在內），如東京·柏林·巴黎·莫斯科·倫敦·華盛頓等地，那一處還比上海舒服，那一處比上海可以滿足享樂，可是，上海一部分人的心理，對於現在生活狀况，却還表示不滿。而實際上依然盡量享樂，盡量爭取暴利。在他們的腦際裏，從來不會想到明天的問題，也許根本上就沒有明天問題的跡象，所謂今朝有酒今朝醉，今天在歡了明天再說。所以，戰時生活在上海是未曾自發實踐過的。</p>
<p>然而，實際上能够在歡享樂的，還是貪汚與暴利成功的少數人，這些人中，能有幾人想到大多數人生活的艱苦，能有幾人想到未來的危機，更能有幾人想到防禦及準備辦法。所以，我們一再堅決主張剷除暴利與貪汚，因爲暴利與貪汚是享樂的資本，享樂又是麻醉人心的毒物。這幾天黃金暴漲，公債暴漲，又是這般暴利者的勾當，爲什麼當局不予制止。同時，我們進一步希望當局應對市民强迫實踐戰時生活。在此日趨緊張的決戰局面之下，足以麻醉人心的享樂生活，足以消耗物力的享樂生活，絕對需要取締。首先喚起自肅精神，自動的降低生活耗費，不再追求暴利。繼之實施平等平均的戰時生活，取締一切超過戰時生活需要的奢糜消耗。</p>
<p>關於自肅精神一點，對於本市警務人員能在最短期內，自動振肅，表示欣佩。譬如過去警察在市區及郊外，對於携物過路，常有勒索之舉，據一般估計，市民從這面所損失的，每月的有四萬五千萬元之譜。自從周市長羅秘書長到任以後，就逐漸消滅。這種警員的自肅精神很可佩服。一面固然希望當局從速切實整頓稅收，提高警員待遇。一面市民方面，對於此種自肅精神，爲表示獎善起見，也應有所鼓勵表示。</p>
<p>總之，我們不能不嚴密注視上海潛伏的危機，更不能不妥籌消弭之道。在消極方面必須剷除暴利，並强迫實踐戰時生活。積極方面對於確立四郊及市內治安，並準備臨時救濟工作，都屬切要之舉。</p>

<p>褚外長歡迎詞</p>
<p>南京五日中央社電　外交部長褚民誼氏於五日晚歡宴滿洲國新任駐華李紹庚大使席上致歡迎詞，原文如下：「李大使閣下，今天爲滿洲國第二任駐華李大使來我國履新之日，特備粗宴，以表歡迎，承貴大使閣下及各位閣下，於百忙中惠然光臨，本人無任欣幸之至」。</p>
<p>溯自民國廿九年十一月卅日，中日滿三國共同宣言發表以來，貴我兩國，即互派使節，恢復邦交，迄今已四年有餘，中間爲實踐三國宣言之精神，我汪故主席於民國卅一年三月八日，曾親自訪問貴國，承貴國皇帝陛下優隆款待，復派張國務總理大臣爲特使，來我國答禮，信使往還，不絕於途，兩國關係，更日趨緊密，迨大東亞戰爭發動以後，又各傾其全力，協助戰爭之完遂，前年又有大東亞共同宣言之發表，此種宣言，實即由我三國宣言之精神擴大而爲全東亞各國家各民族之共同宣言，亦即貴我兩國於三國宣言之外，又加多一層緊密之關係，所以我汪故主席，曾經昭示我們，中國與滿洲本是同胞，現在是同胞，將來仍是同胞，言短情長，發人深省，實與滿洲與日本之一德一心，不可分離之擬意完全相同。</p>
<p>現在大東亞戰爭愈益激烈，已進入决戰階段，我兩國仍當本過去合作之精神，共向協力戰爭之同一目標，勇往邁進，俾最後勝利，得以早日實現，此項人願以最大之努力，與貴大使共勉之。</p>
<p>貴大使從前任駐日大使時，本人亦適任駐日大使，同駐東京，晤面機會極多，對於貴大使道德學問與卓越之經騐，極爲欽佩，嗣本人奉調回國，重長外交部，而貴大使不久亦離日返國，就任外交大臣，此種遷調，在兩國外交上，誠值得紀念與共幸也。前任呂大使駐在我國瞬將四年，並於增進兩國邦交之友好，文化之交流，已建樹偉大之功績，此决榮遷返國，本人深表惜別之意，並望其爲國珍衛</p>
<p>現在貴大使奉使我國，舊雨相逢，實覺衷心欣快，今後共同努力，當不减於往昔，我國政府對於貴大使之執行職務，亦必予以一切之援助也。茲舉杯敬祝貴國皇帝陛下聖躬康泰，貴國國運日隆曁貴大使閣下各位閣下健康」</p>

<h3>加強防空準備預防敵機濫炸</h3>
<p>隨着戰局的急迫，敵機的空襲勢必頻繁。在渝美空軍完全擊滅之日，自然不必憂慮，但今日尚須暫時忍受敵機空襲。盟邦陸海航空部隊爲期傾覆敵方空軍基地，炸毀其機材，切斷其運輸起見，正在加緊奮鬥。可是，想在上海及各大都市上空沒有一架敵機侵入，實在很難，而美國空軍將來將不分皂白地濫行轟炸，也是意料中的事。我們須有相當的警惕。</p>
<p>上海居民中，很多人相信「美國空軍絕對不會轟炸華人住宅區，轟炸當以日本的軍事設施及虹口等日本人密集的區域爲主，所以不必担憂。」這種謬誤的見解如何發出，雖然不得而知，但總而言之是愚蠢的傻話。迄今爲止，美機的空襲不是一味盲炸沒有任何日本軍事設施的地點嗎？因此不是有許多無辜的民衆白白丟掉性命，喪失財產和房屋嗎？敵機的轟炸如何亂來，拿岳州·長沙·浦口·漢口的例來看就可明白，尤其在上海，更有明顯的實例在。英美人原對中國人抱着人種上的歧視。英美對於和他們作戰而有同等以上的强大戰力的盟邦日本，尚且懷有露骨的蔑視，對我中國及中國人還有什麼好觀念呢？這是很明顯的事情。總而言之，他們將中國人常作奴隸看待。如果分配利益的話，就和過去一樣採取對付殖民地一般的措置，仿彿是他們豢養的家畜，任意宰割。要知道，東洋的眞正敵人是英美，過去英國的侵略及美國的榨取，是中國人就該好好反省，細細咀嚼的。</p>
<p>敵機的空襲還含有政治作用。例如他們派一兩架飛機侵入上海，實行轟作，殺傷民衆，希望使中國人對日本的反感增大，說得明白些，就是想使民衆發生「因爲日本人在這裏所以來轟炸」的思想，並且釀成民衆對於空襲的恐懼心理，以圖離間中日。此外，當然也含有不問防空如何嚴密，美國空軍的實力均足突破它的宣傳作用。</p>
<p>在這種情勢之下，我們對於空襲有什慶準備呢？除出一部分負担防空任務的組織以外，一般居民對於空襲都沒有什麼準備可言。試觀上海馬路上有多少穿防空服的人？至於防空壕，也沒有準備好，避難所亦未明白指定，防火用水等更是不在話卞了。他如不幸負傷者的救急治療及有秩序的避難行動等，差不全無準備。</p>
<p>在如此的狀況之下，敵機如果實行不分皂白的濫炸，不但房屋倒壞，家財喪失，就是個人的生命也不能保證。要想避免這種災害，個人應該如何做才好呢？希望大家和盟邦日本一樣，常以敵機的空襲自惕，刻刻小心，時時準備。至於現實的準備，則有下列數項：</p>
<p>（一）穿着防空服　中裝完全不宜非常之時的活動，須加改良，以期行動敏捷。最好整天穿着防空服，男女一律。合於舊日風俗習慣而不適於時局的服裝，應於此時速即改良，庶可應付空襲。</p>
<p>（二）準備防空壕　受到轟炸時，爲防護寳貴的生命起見，最佳莫過於躱入防空壕中。躱在防空壕內，尤其是上面有掩遮的，實在安全得多，生命因而得吿保全的實例很多。反之，因空襲時不逃入防空壕而遭爆風震斃或因房屋坍倒壓壞的人，也多的是。因此，平時應該準備可以以自己和家族的運命相託的防空壕。</p>
<p>（三）防火準備　空襲時速即熄滅燈火，是絕對必要的措置。更進一步須備好撲滅火災用的水和砂，以及其他各種防火準備。</p>
<p>（四）救急治療　爲在空襲時救治不幸的負傷者，救治方法，救護訓練及其後的處置等，平日即須充分研究演習，以備非常之用。</p>
<p>除此以外，爲保全家財起見，應當立即疏散。蓋在敵機的盲炸之下，辛辛苦苦置備起來的傢俱，被服，貴重物品等，可以一舉化爲灰燼。而且在今日一件傢俱損失以後要想再行添置，實在不是容易的事。如果預先將東西疏散，那末萬一空襲時損失了一部分，還有一部分可以保全，不致弄得身無長物。敵機濫施轟炸時，固然沒有一個地方可以保證是安全的，但袖手讓自己陷入赤負之境的事，總得盡力避免。</p>
<p>實行「物」的疏散時，也應想到「人」的疏散。在人口稠密的都市中，在非常之際足以牽累活動的老幼男女，應於事前送往比較安全的遠郊去避難，以免成爲敵機濫炸的犧牲。</p>
<p>上面的說明雖然簡單，但全是空襲下應有的措置，必須的準備。現在，一般人對於空襲都漠不關心，且無凖備，實多招致最大不幸的危險性。英美決不會保全中國人，他們要壓殺炸死我們！在敵機正圖濫施轟炸之際，而仍悠然不迫的，都是不要生命財產的人。我們固須信賴盟邦的軍事力量，但同時務須防範敵美從天空濫行殘虐的殺戮，這實在是國家要求我們負擔起來的最大任務。（夫）</p>

<h3>輪埠碼頭黑幕依然重重　黃牛黨活躍異常</h3>
<p>本市自經事變以還，以社會政治經濟等之未盡入正軌，致造成空前未有之畸形狀態，諸如車站之兜售黑市車票，「黑帽子」「紅帽子」之狐假虎威，碼頭上之「黃牛黨」充斥橫行，敲詐劍削，以及警士之公然沿途勒索，有目共睹，婦孺皆知，貽笑中外，莫可諱飾。乃自周市長蒞任以來，威望所播，宵小歛跡，即如警士積習，因以當局嚴格管理，改善待遇，而漸守本分，車站秩序，亦以督察嚴明，轉趨良好。中央社記者爲明瞭目前碼頭之一般實况起見，復於昨（五）日晨親至外灘一帶巡視，茲將觀察所得，報吿關心人士，記者於昨農十一時餘抵達十二號碼頭，其時適中華輪船公司售票處在窗口發售往新港之船票，搭客列隊購買，秩序似乎尚佳，但「黃牛黨」等依然活躍異常，若輩與公司職員似有聯絡，招攬乘客，包購黑市船票，黨徒竟公然站於購買搭客行列之前端，兜攪購票，索價甚昂，致遵守秩序者等候達數小時之久，始終未獲購得，徒呼奈何而已。至當地值崗警士，不但不上前維持秩序，制止宵小活動，更視若無睹，公司員役亦忙於出入售票處，索賄代購，票面一千三百元者，抬高至一千六百或竟在二千元以上，如此怠忽職務，殊堪注目，深盼主管當局迅作嚴峻措置，杜絕積弊，以利商旅。</p>
<h3>警局裁撤專員名義</h3>
<p>上海特別市警察局於二月一日實施調整機構，整頓人事，俾增進工作效能。茲悉周兼局長昨（五）日頒發手諭，將無實際工作之專員高觀宸·錢伯潤·丁政言·　相讓·邢乃永·馬平　·李振寰·趙玄堂·湯堅·邵景範·楊　先·藍亦蘇·汪桂珊·沈雄飛·許鳳書等十五人，均令免本職，另候任用。</p>
<h3>市公用局局務會議</h3>
<p>市公用局於昨（五）日下午三時舉行首次局務會議，到有該局主任秘書，各科科長，技正等，首由徐局長闡明開會目的，對今後該局應興應革各項工作計劃，討論綦詳，旋由各料提供意見，至五時許始畢。聞該局對今後半年，應予實施各項工作，業已决定計劃大綱，即將於日內按步實施。</p>
<h3>三輪車人力車擅自加租</h3>
<p>市公用局鹽於最近期內，人力車及三輪車乘電車減少行駛班决，交通工具缺乏之際，竟任意高抬車價，致使一般市民無形增加負祖，經該局派員調查結果，很悉人力車及三輪車公司當局，乘此次市府交替，公用局正着手調整內部之際，不法擅自增加車租，據悉人力車租前經核定每日車租四百元，竟高增至八百元，三輪車核定租金每天一千五百元，竟漲至每日三千元，於此上層剝削之下，拋扛三輪車及人力車夫遂任意抬價，該局現正嚴密偵查，一俟查有實據，將非法車商予以嚴厲處罰。</p>
<h3>本市市區印花月銷千萬元</h3>
<p>江蘇印花菸酒稅局負責人負聲稱，本市區印花稅自去年七月十五日財政部公佈修正非常時期印花稅法實施以來，經局方積極推進，復經稅務署督率，查緝處之認眞馴查，本市各大廠商公司行棧，均尚能明瞭印花爲重要國稅，所有薄册單據及發票等，尚能實貼印花，惟規模較小之商店，常以計數單代發票，故意不貼印花者，爲數尚多，聞局方正在設法加以糾正，故每月銷額已達七八百萬元之多，比較過去月銷僅四五十萬元，自不可相提並論，將來倘能繼續改進，其銷數當更有可觀。</p>
<h3>市敎局公布本學期校曆</h3>

<h3>「水仙花」觀後</h3>
<p>— 淑君</p>
<p>「永仙花」一劇爲顧仲彝先生所編，前年在天宮上演，曾連續數十日之久，可謂盛極一時，此次爲籌募安老院經費，特由石揮唐若靑爾大藝人合作演出，錦上添花，尤見精彩，而外傳假借急公好義之名云云，實係大誤會也。</p>
<p>水仙花現正當令，爲家家案頭淸供所必備，蓋此花雖不若松柏之長靑，而其放葩必於嚴冬，產於深山幽谷之中，兼梅蘭之淸高絕俗，具雅菊之孤芳自賞，令人見之有灑灑出塵之想，而「水仙花」一劇，亦正具有此種風格，示人以正義之召，誠值吾人一觀之劇作也。</p>
<p>全劇頗能抓住重心，緊張演出，第一二幕在陶家客廳中，歐陽瑩仙（唐若靑飾）之天眞無邪，頗見灑灑，不失新女性風格。陶憲南（石揮飾）一種傷心別有懷抱之舉止神態，充分流露其內心苦痛，表情非常深刻，頗能激起觀衆同情。韋瑪麗（杜萍飾）心目中祗有金錢勢利，不並愛情之眞諦，與其一般酒肉朋友只圖物質享受者，價可爲今日社會之針砭。孫企英之梅律師，陰險狡獪，表情亦屬刻劃盡致。第三四幕在瑩仙表兄金廣靑家，金廣靑（陳玉麟飾）爲傳敎牧師，然而拘泥不化，其不近人情之處，演來維妙維肖，引人軒渠不置，其愛人江小姐（立里飾）演出亦頗活潑玲瓏，嬌小可愛。最後一幕，寫陶憲南之窮愁潦倒失明斷臂後之對白表情尤見深刻動人，與受創病危之秋海棠，有異曲同工之妙，石揮演來可謂淋漓盡緻。而唐若靑在此劇中亦有驚人之成績。</p>
<p>聞此劇在麗華上演只有三天，演期無多，愛好話劇諸君，幸勿交臂失之。</p>

<h3>大堪注目的「學店老」收入問題</h3>
<p>— 沈立爾</p>
<p>本市敎育當局自於上月九日公佈學費微收標準後，以一般物價驟吿曇漲，爲顧及各私立中小學校之困難，爰經調整該項收費標準，增加一倍；關於此點，不能不謂敎育當局在現實環境之下，對於敎育事業的維護，已盡絕大苦心；然而，事實上各私立中小學校之遵照調整後的收費標準徵學費者，固未嘗無其人，惟大多數私立中小學校則依然按照其自定者徵收，而其數目則超過敎局公佈之收費標準數倍以上者，亦頗不乏見。似此情形敎局應如何處置此一問題以維持功令尊嚴，姑暫不論，而「學店老　」於此銀根奇緊之際，以徵收學費之機會驟獲鉅額現鈔，是滯有以「游資」的姿態進出於投機市塲，由於操縱物資而造成物價再度暴漲而坐收暴利之可能，則爲抑平物價以安定民生計，似實大堪注目。</p>
<p>按照目前一般私立中小學校之徵收學費額，小學平均爲一萬五千元，中學爲二萬四千元，姑以中小學平均以每人兩萬元論，則擁有三百名中小學生之私立學校校長即於此數日間驟得現鈔六百萬元，至規模較大學生人數多至二千人以上者，（擁有二千學生之學校雖不多見，但爲數亦在四五所之上），所獲現款，即爲四千萬元以上。茍以其中之減費免費者佔其百分之二十，則其收入亦不在三千萬元以下。間中雖不無爲顧及學生家長困難而採取通融的「分期繳費辦法」者，但究爲其中絕少數；質是而論，此三千萬現款之運用，茍一旦進出於投機囤積之市塲，則物價不無影響，自屬無可疑義之必然趨勢。然則，人民生活負組之量，行將於市儈奸商之重疊壓粹之餘，再加「學店老　」之運用游資以求　利的　毒，則無　「火中加油」，「　上添霜」。即使退一步言，「學店老　」或有不善營商，而不敢親臨商戰之塲者，多以高利貸放息圖利，近日之「黑市」拆息竟達三角，三千萬元現款即可以「先行扣息」的壓榨手法，取得九百萬元，而此九百萬元之重利，又將經由奸商之手而加倍套罩於一般人民的生活重擔之上。是則「學店老　」又不能不坐簡接促成物價暴漲之嫌，面臨着遵個課題，我們爲抑平物價以安定民生的立塲，謹建議下列各點</p>
<p>（一）「學店老　」旣形成與銀行錢莊相類似的投機者，政府當局應以監視銀行錢莊不得利用其資財以事投機，藉安戰時人民生活的法規，同時監視「學店老　」的「游資活動」。在必要時，賦給「金融檢查處」以特權，以檢查「學店老　」之「經濟行動」。</p>
<p>（二）學校敎職員全體要求六個月敎職薪一次發淸，使游資「化整爲零」，俾「學店老　」無從進行大規模的投機行爲；否則，敎職員應負奮監視其校長的「經濟行動」，幷要求公開其以學費所得拆息，訴諸社會公斷。</p>
<p>（三）敎育當局積極進行審查各私立學校之收支帳目，而其審查重點不必着眼於其敎職員之薪給支配是否合乎部頒的百分之七十五的比率，而應置其重點於各校長運用高利貸的手法而獲得鉅額利息的運用。</p>
<p>（四）興論界積極檢舉以學費收入從事投機的「學店老　」；幷以道義的立塲，曉以大義。今日之學生家長，爲不忍坐視其子女失學，多不恤受高貸的剝削以來得學費，若以此等錢財促成物價暴漲，簡接再度增加學生家長的負擔。</p>
<p>上述四點，雖未必盡警，但我們爲提防「學店老　」不盡其心力於其本位工作而競於廢曆年後的「紅盤」開後的物價問題，勢有所不能緘默。藍此一問題，影響所及，當不止於國家民族命脈所寄之敎育問題而已，且已跨出學校的門檻，而進入於整個上海市民生活的大闊子內，事態之嚴重，不僅爲學生業與敎職員的生活問題了。</p>
<h3>一舉兩失</h3>
<p>— 劍寒</p>
<p>喧　一時的學費問題，隨着各級學校的先後開學，逐漸消沉了。可是學費太高的影響，却正在社會上逐漸展開。其中最顯而易見的，有以下的兩個大問題：</p>
<p>第一，就是各學校的學生數，都大量的減少了，有打八折的，有打七折六折的，甚至不到半數的也有。這些老學生到那裏去了呢？除掉一小產分回鄕的以外，其餘的大都失學了！他們都因爲交不起學費，以至被拒在學校大門之外。在「學店老　」的眼光裏，他們是不應當有受敎育的權利的。</p>
<p>第二，就是各學校的敎員也大批的失業了，普通商店的生意冷淡，開支不易，唯一的辦法，就是解　店員。大小學店，也不能例外，像本市的西成小學，不有六位敎員被同時解顧。不問過去的勞績如何，敎學的成績如何？惟一的理由，就是學生敬減少，班數縮減了。請想在目今生活高漲的情形之下，一旦失業，叫他們到那裏去找生路呢？同舟共濟，患難相共，在「學店老　」的頭腦之中，根本是沒有的。</p>
<p>增高學費，使學生失學，敎師失業，眞是一舉兩失！可是學店老　呢，却毫無損失。在此失學學生和失業敎員啼笑皆非的時候，他又可以拿着大批的現款，去做他們跑單帮，開公司的資金了！</p>
<p>增高學費，館了校長，害了敎員，苦了學生！（稱酬助失業敎師）</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Manila Area: Japanese Army and Navy Intercept Enemy, Japanese Troops on Polillo Island Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from a Philippine Frontline Base, 5th: Enemy forces advancing southward from the San Fernando area gradually approached the northern outskirts of Manila by the 3rd. After subjecting the Manila area to intense shelling, a portion of the enemy forces broke into Manila city proper around 5:00 PM on the 3rd. Japanese troops are currently intercepting the invading enemy forces at Santo Tomas University, engaging in fierce combat.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from a Philippine Frontline Base, 5th: The Japanese Manila defense forces immediately rose up to intercept the enemy's incursion into Manila, and are currently engaged in fierce combat centered around the vicinity of Santo Tomas University. The enemy has suffered heavy losses, but the power plant has been destroyed due to enemy shelling and bombing, so Manila has been plunged into darkness since the 3rd. Japanese and American forces are repeatedly engaging in fierce battles in the northern part of the city. The enemy is also gradually approaching the southern part of Manila with reinforcements from Batangas province by air and sea, but Japanese troops are preventing the enemy's northward advance at various locations and engaging them in fierce combat.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from a Philippine Frontline Base, 5th: The Japanese Army and Navy are currently intercepting the enemy forces invading the Manila area, launching attacks everywhere and inflicting great damage on the enemy. In addition, the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces intercepted enemy troops in the suburbs of Manila on the 3rd and launched a fierce counterattack, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. It has now been determined that the Army and Navy forces have achieved the following results: killed or wounded over 1,600 enemy soldiers, destroyed and set ablaze 17 enemy tanks, over 26 transport vehicles, and over 24 artillery pieces.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from a Philippine Base, 5th: In coordination with the battle for Luzon Island, the enemy has recently begun invading operations in the central and southern Philippines. On January 18th, the enemy landed 2,000 new soldiers with about a dozen vehicles on Polillo Island, the main island of the Sulu archipelago. The Japanese garrison on the southwest coast of the island carried out hand-to-hand combat attacks throughout the night, and on the 27th, the entire force, united as one, boldly charged into the enemy's ranks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. By the 27th, the garrison had killed approximately 300 enemy soldiers, destroyed one mountain gun, three amphibious tanks, and 21 encampments. In the central Philippines, the enemy is also attempting to cut off transportation between Leyte and Cebu Islands and is patrolling the coast of Cebu Island with torpedo boats.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 5th: On the Luzon Island front, Japanese troops are conducting a thorough defensive operation. Newspapers here today, the 5th, published the following report on the war situation: The American enemy is single-mindedly advancing on Manila and making exaggerated claims, saying that the Philippine war situation will be transformed by the capture of Manila. After being intercepted by Japanese troops, the enemy nevertheless forcibly invaded and advanced to the outskirts of Manila, claiming that the city has already been occupied. If they were to occupy Manila, they would surely broadcast propaganda claiming that the Philippine war is over. However, the Japanese army's goal is to make the American army bleed, and Manila has no military value. The Japanese army's objective is not land or cities, but to annihilate the enemy's forces. Therefore, even if Manila becomes a battlefield, the Philippine war, and even the Luzon Island war, will not end there, but will actually begin there.</p>
<h3>Mindanao Police Force Swears to Sacrifice Themselves for the Nation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Mindanao, 5th: As the decisive battle between Japan and the United States approaches, the Mindanao detachment of the Philippine police force is cooperating with the Japanese military to maintain public order and provide labor tirelessly. Recently, to express their sincere desire to die for their country, they signed a pledge in their own blood and submitted it to the Philippine Republic authorities, expressing their determination to sacrifice their lives to meet the national crisis. The gist of the pledge is as follows: The Philippines has declared war on the United States and Britain. Under the leadership of President Laurel, we are striving for the common goals of the nations of Greater East Asia. Receiving divine blessings, we hereby solemnly pledge loyalty, to engage in combat with the American forces, to faithfully fulfill our duties, and to sacrifice our lives if necessary.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides to Dissolve the Newspaper Association</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 5th: At a Cabinet meeting on the 2nd, the Japanese government decided to dissolve the Japan Newspaper Association on March 1st. The dissolution order was issued on the 4th. The Japan Newspaper Association was established on February 5, 1942, and for three years, it has cooperated with the government's newspaper control efforts, upholding the government's intentions and promoting the public interest of newspapers. During this time, it contributed greatly to strengthening the newspaper system by reorganizing newspaper companies, eliminating the commercial aspects of newspapers, establishing a joint newspaper sales system, and implementing a newspaper reporter registration system, thus fulfilling its mission. In view of the increasingly serious situation, the government has decided to implement a more thorough and self-regulated responsibility system for each newly opened company, in order to promote free speech and closer unity between the government and the private sector, and to open up the difficult situation. In the future, the Speech Guidance Department will be directly managed by the Information Bureau. Regarding the allocation of newspaper paper and other materials, joint facilities, newspaper reporter registration, and newspaper distribution and sales, it is planned that the incorporated association Japan Newspaper Corporation (provisional name), which is scheduled to be established on March 1st, will be responsible for these matters. The organization of the Newspaper Corporation will be formally established after the dissolution of the Japan Newspaper Association. In addition, the resolutions of the Greater East Asia Newspaper Conference, held the year before last, will establish an office within the Newspaper Corporation.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service Held Yesterday for the Late Advisor Suga</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th: Today, the 5th, was the fourth anniversary of the martyrdom of Lieutenant General Suga, the late military advisor to the National Government. Chinese and Japanese authorities jointly held a memorial service at 10:30 AM in front of Suga's tombstone at Jiming Temple. Those present included Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Chief of General Staff Bao Wenyue, Naval Minister Ling, Social Welfare Minister Ding Mocun, Chief Secretary Zhou Longxiang, Envoy Zhang Chao, Allied States Envoy Qidao, Consul Tanaka, Garrison Commander Umezaki, Police Chief of the Consulate General Goto, Investigator Matsumura, and dozens of others. Acting Chairman Chen also made a special visit and led all the memorial service participants in bowing once before Suga's tomb. After the ceremony, four Chinese monks and three Japanese monks chanted sutras for deliverance. Acting Chairman Chen then offered incense first as the chief celebrant, and other Chinese and Japanese memorial service participants also took turns offering incense. The ceremony concluded at a little after 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Roundtable Discussion on Ultra-High Altitude Warfare</h3>
<p>Aerial warfare has progressed to ultra-high altitudes. Over Leyte, in the midst of fierce fighting, and over the mainland of Japan, where enemy planes come to bomb, air combat is all taking place at ultra-high altitudes, that is, at 6,000 to 8,000 meters, or 8,000 to 10,000 meters above sea level. At the same time, recent air combat is mostly taking place at altitudes too high for the human eye to see. As air combat has undergone such great changes, our brave Japanese pilots have also overcome drastic weather changes. At altitudes above 10,000 meters, the temperature reaches minus 55 degrees Celsius, causing the skin to crack and the leather gloves gripping the propellers to even ice over. The development of aircraft has infinitely demanded altitude and speed. The current aerial warfare is already being conducted at altitudes of 10,000 meters. As for stratospheric air combat, the era when the superiority of the aircraft determines victory or defeat must not be far off. The enemy American's boasted Flying Fortress B-29 aircraft, which bombed the Japanese mainland at ultra-high altitudes, were driven away with their tails between their legs, which proves the excellence of Japanese aircraft. However, we must not be complacent about this, because ultra-high altitude combat is a production battle. To meet the needs of the soldiers, the biggest task this year is to produce even more superior aircraft. What do the warriors who are tirelessly protecting the skies over Japan and fighting desperately with the B-29s demand of the production front? The Mainichi Shimbun convened a roundtable discussion on ultra-high altitude warfare at a certain air defense unit base in northern Kyushu to hear the experiences of battle-hardened warriors. At the same time, there were also powerful reports on the current state of aircraft production.</p>
<p>Major Yamamoto: The enemy American B-29 aircraft came flying at ultra-high altitudes, opening up a new battlefield of the lower stratosphere at around 10,000 meters, which has become a topic of concern for all Japanese citizens. This battlefield, which has never existed in previous war history, and the many mysterious realms within the realm of science, have all become the places where victories and defeats are decided in this great war. In order to win the victory in aerial warfare, it is naturally necessary to make the general public understand this mysterious high altitude, and at the same time, it is also necessary to overcome the many harsh conditions of high altitude and produce excellent aircraft. In order to enhance this national will, please feel free to talk about everyone's personal experience of fighting with B-29s at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Reporter: What exactly does ultra-high altitude refer to?</p>
<p>Captain Sasa: In the past, 6,600 feet was called ultra-high altitude, but it's different now, 8,000 meters or more is called ultra-high altitude. That is to say, it is 2,000 meters higher than before. These 2,000 meters are really extraordinary.</p>
<p>Major Yamamoto: There must be a big difference in the flight conditions at 6,000 meters and 8,000 meters!</p>
<p>Captain Sasa: The difference is huge. The change of these 2,000 meters is really beyond what ordinary people can imagine.</p>
<p>Major Yamamoto: That's equal to the height of two Mount Fujis. Perhaps less than a quarter of all Japanese people have been to the summit of Mount Fuji. For human beings without wings, that is truly an unimaginable mysterious realm.</p>
<p>Reporter: What is the difference in temperature?</p>
<p>Major Kobayashi: The altitude of 10,000 meters is minus 51 degrees Celsius, so the altitude of 8,000 meters is around minus 42 degrees.</p>
<p>Major Yamamoto: There is a difference of about 40 to 50 degrees.</p>
<p>Captain Itakura: At 7,000 meters above Burma, it is also 30 to 40 degrees, so at such a high altitude, there is not much difference between the tropics and the cold zone.</p>
<p>Captain Imai: The air currents are very clear and there is no dust obstructing the view. When you look out from the plane, it is really open and clear, and you only feel a little dim beside your seat. In short, the difference between light and dark is very obvious.</p>
<p>Major Yamamoto: It's very different from the degree of light and dark that people on the ground imagine.</p>
<p>Major Kobayashi: On a clear day, if you fly to an altitude of 6,000 meters, you can see Korea. As for Tsushima, it can be seen very clearly.</p>
<p>Major Kobayashi: On the ground, you can see mountains and the sea, but the viewing line is always limited. When you fly to such a high altitude, it is a vast and boundless sky, so searching for the enemy really feels like looking for a needle in a haystack. Ordinary people think that when a B-29 flies over, you can see it right away, but this is really the talk of a person from Qi Dong. Perhaps it is because you feel small in the vast sky.</p>
<p>Captain Sasa: Because there is no object, you completely lose the sense of perspective, like going back and forth in a fog. The so-called fog, when you drill into the fog in the sky, it sparkles and glows. It's completely like scattered silver sand.</p>
<p>Major Kobayashi: The so-called clouds are crystal bodies. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to call them smoke. When you look at them from below, they are completely clouds, but when you fly into them, you don't know if you are in the clouds, you just feel that your vision is suddenly poor. It is completely smoke, because it is ever-changing and difficult to grasp, which is why you really feel like you have fallen into a fog.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Kashide: When a person ascends to ultra-high altitude, he really feels lonely, so he often talks to himself.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Kashide: If there is a friendly plane, that would be really happy.</p>
<p>Major Kobayashi: At this time, if you try to fire a gun, the mood suddenly changes and you don't feel lonely.</p>
<p>Reporter: When you fly to high altitude, the temperature changes in an instant, so are you all wearing electric heating suits?</p>
<p>Major Kobayashi: We will use electric heating suits in the future, but we haven't used them yet. Everyone hasn't had any problems yet.</p>
<p>Reporter: Oh! So there are no convenient electric heating suits yet?</p>
<p>Major Kobayashi: Even if you wear an electric heating suit, your hands and feet are still cold. Holding the propeller, you feel that the outside of your gloves is frozen, but the inside is very hot, which is really a strange feeling. Although I wear an oxygen mask, my eyelashes are frozen and my eyes feel sluggish.</p>
<p>Captain Sasa: Sometimes I suddenly feel like something is covering my eyes and I can't see. It turns out that my eyelashes are covered with ice. (Translated by An from the Mainichi Shimbun, January 3rd)</p>

<h3>Self-Restraint of Hedonists</h3>
<p>In general, people believe that Shanghai is the only pleasure zone in China, where all kinds of hedonistic activities are available. Therefore, the mentality of those who live in Shanghai is also one of hedonism. The formation of this mentality is the result of decades of chronic anaesthesia by British and American imperialism within the concessions. In the past, with the concessions, everything was allowed. One could be shielded for all criminal acts, one need not worry about national affairs, one need not worry about social matters. Even when war approached beyond the concessions, one could simply stay within the concessions, lie in bed and listen to the sound of gunfire, unaffected, and still enjoy life to the full. Therefore, they only cared about selfishness and profit, in order to seize the capital for enjoyment. Even now, although there are no more concessions, a large number of people still hold the view that nothing else matters except enjoying life to the full.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the past, the Greater East Asia War has been going on for more than three years. Which metropolis in the world (including the enemy's), such as Tokyo, Berlin, Paris, Moscow, London, Washington, is more comfortable than Shanghai? Which is better able to satisfy hedonism than Shanghai? Yet the mentality of some people in Shanghai is still dissatisfied with the current state of affairs. And in reality, they are still enjoying themselves as much as possible and trying to gain exorbitant profits as much as possible. In their minds, they never think about the problems of tomorrow, perhaps there are no signs of the problems of tomorrow at all. As the saying goes, "Drink today, worry about tomorrow later". Therefore, wartime life has never been spontaneously practiced in Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, in reality, those who are able to enjoy themselves are still the small number of people who have succeeded in corruption and profiteering. How many of these people think about the hardships of life for the majority? How many think about the crises of the future? And how many think about defence and preparedness measures? Therefore, we have repeatedly insisted on resolutely eliminating profiteering and corruption, because profiteering and corruption are the capital for enjoyment, and enjoyment is a drug that anaesthetizes people's minds. These past few days, the skyrocketing prices of gold and public bonds are again the work of these profiteers. Why doesn't the authorities stop them? At the same time, we further hope that the authorities will force citizens to practice wartime life. In this increasingly tense decisive battle situation, hedonistic lifestyles that are enough to anaesthetize people's minds, and hedonistic lifestyles that consume material resources, absolutely need to be banned. First, awaken the spirit of self-restraint, automatically reduce living expenses, and no longer pursue exorbitant profits. Then, implement an equal and average wartime life and ban all extravagant consumption that exceeds wartime living needs.</p>
<p>Regarding the point of self-restraint, we express our admiration for the fact that the city's police officers have been able to automatically revitalize themselves in the shortest possible time. For example, in the past, the police in the urban and suburban areas often extorted passersby carrying goods. According to general estimates, the losses suffered by citizens in this area amounted to 450 million yuan per month. Since the appointment of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, this has gradually been eliminated. This spirit of self-restraint on the part of the police is admirable. On the one hand, we hope that the authorities will quickly and effectively reorganize tax collection and improve the treatment of police officers. On the other hand, the citizens, in order to show their encouragement for this spirit of self-restraint, should also express their gratitude.</p>
<p>In short, we cannot but closely monitor the latent crises in Shanghai, and we cannot but properly plan ways to eliminate them. In the passive aspect, we must eliminate exorbitant profits and force the practice of wartime life. In the active aspect, establishing security in the suburbs and the city, and preparing temporary relief work, are all essential measures.</p>

Ambassador Li and his entourage also attended a luncheon hosted by Acting Chairman Chen at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - After Mr. Li Shaogeng, the newly appointed Manchukuo Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China, presented his credentials to the National Government on the morning of the 5th, Mr. Fu Shuangying, Chief Aide-de-Camp of the National Government, specially went to the Manchukuo Embassy at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to return the visit on behalf of Acting Chairman Chen.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - To welcome the newly appointed Manchukuo Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China, Li Shaogeng, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi hosted a banquet at the International Club at 7:00 PM last night, with the heads of various ministries and councils of the National Government in attendance.

The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 9:00 PM when the banquet ended.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu's Welcoming Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Chu Minyi delivered a welcoming speech at the banquet held on the evening of the 5th to welcome Li Shaogeng, the newly appointed Manchukuo Ambassador to China. The original text is as follows: "Your Excellency Ambassador Li, today is the day of the arrival of the second Manchukuo Ambassador to China, Your Excellency Li, to assume his new post in our country. I have prepared a simple banquet to express our welcome. I am extremely honored that Your Excellency Ambassador and all of you Excellencies have graced us with your presence in your busy schedules."</p>
<p>"Since the publication of the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo on November 30th of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), our two countries have exchanged envoys and restored diplomatic relations. It has been more than four years since then. In order to implement the spirit of the tripartite declaration, our late Chairman Wang personally visited your country on March 8th of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), and was received with great courtesy by His Majesty the Emperor of your country. Prime Minister Zhang was also dispatched as a special envoy to return the courtesy to our country. Envoys have traveled back and forth incessantly, and the relationship between the two countries has become even closer. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, both countries have exerted their full strength to assist in the completion of the war. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was also issued the year before last. This declaration is, in fact, an expansion of the spirit of our tripartite declaration into a joint declaration of all countries and nations in East Asia. It is also an additional layer of close relations between our two countries on top of the tripartite declaration. Therefore, our late Chairman Wang once declared to us that China and Manchukuo are compatriots, are now compatriots, and will continue to be compatriots in the future. These words, though short, are full of deep meaning and are thought-provoking. They are completely consistent with the idea that Manchukuo and Japan are of one heart and mind and cannot be separated."</p>
<p>"Now that the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly fierce and has entered the decisive stage, our two countries should continue to uphold the spirit of cooperation in the past and bravely advance towards the same goal of cooperating in the war so that the final victory can be achieved as soon as possible. I will make the greatest effort to encourage this wish together with Your Excellency Ambassador."</p>
<p>"When Your Excellency Ambassador previously served as Ambassador to Japan, I also happened to be serving as Ambassador to Japan. We had many opportunities to meet in Tokyo. I have great admiration for Your Excellency Ambassador's morality, knowledge, and outstanding experience. Later, I was transferred back to China and resumed my position as Foreign Minister, and Your Excellency Ambassador also soon left Japan and returned to your country to assume the position of Foreign Minister. These kinds of transfers are truly worthy of commemoration and mutual joy in the diplomacy of both countries. Former Ambassador Lü served in our country for nearly four years and has made great contributions to promoting friendship and cultural exchange between the two countries. I deeply express my regret at his imminent and glorious return to his country, and I hope that he will take good care of himself for the sake of the nation."</p>
<p>"Now that Your Excellency Ambassador has been dispatched to our country, it is truly gratifying to meet an old friend again. We will work together in the future and will not reduce our efforts compared to the past. Our government will also provide all assistance to Your Excellency Ambassador in the performance of your duties. Now, I raise my glass to wish His Majesty the Emperor of your country good health, the prosperity of your country, and the health of Your Excellency Ambassador and all of you Excellencies."</p>

<h3>Location of the Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin Conference</h3>
<p>A City on the Black Sea Coast</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency) - Reuter's news agency reports, Exchange Telegraph Company dispatch this morning: The Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin Conference is currently underway. The dispatch also stated that it has been learned that the conference is being held in a city on the Black Sea coast, but some important negotiations will be held on warships. The number of attendants accompanying the three is greater than the previous Tehran Conference, from which it may be said that all three intend to resolve at least the major issues. London hinted that the British Prime Minister brought many financial experts, presumably to discuss post-war financial issues. The conference also seems to be discussing the publication of a declaration to the German people.</p>
<h3>Situation Before the Opening of the International Trade Union Congress</h3>
<p>Discord Between Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Bern, 5th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, Exchange Telegraph Company comments on the tension before the opening of the World Trade Union Congress, saying that discord has already occurred between the British and American trade unions. Robert, the representative of the American Federation of Labor, gave a speech at the general meeting of the International Trade Union Congress, announcing that his union will not participate in organizations joined by Soviet trade unions, because he believes that Soviet trade unions are not free, but only a part of the Communist Party apparatus. Robert's words aroused considerable commotion among European socialists. Therefore, British miners' leader Lord Wright recently criticized the Americans for coming to Europe and attempting to forcibly change the International Trade Union Congress into the American view. The American Federation of Labor also said that if the Soviet Union participates, they will threaten to withdraw, which is a clear political intimidation. The Trade Union Congress of Industrial Organizations, which is pro-Bolshevik, and the Soviet Trade Union both have representatives participating in the World Trade Union Congress, so those two organizations will inevitably be able to control the congress. Serious disputes may occur again before the opening of the Congress next Tuesday.</p>

<h3>British Industries Association Sends Representatives to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency) - After the United States realized its creeping control over China's economy, Britain, which possesses significant rights and interests in China among the major powers, has recently seemed to be urgently seeking countermeasures. According to Reuters London dispatch, the British Federation of Industries, in order to assist China's industrial associations, established the British Chongqing Development Association several years ago. This time, it has decided to dispatch two members to Chongqing. The delegation is composed of technician Froggatt and Labor Party member Ustic. It is scheduled to depart from Britain this month and arrive in Chongqing at the end of the month. The purpose of this trip is to establish close relations with Chongqing and develop trade between various organizations of the British and Chongqing Industrial Associations. According to Ustic, industrial organizations in Chongqing have received considerable assistance from the British Federation of Industries in the past. Britain is the birthplace of the industrial movement and has abundant experience, so it will provide greater assistance to Chongqing.</p>

Marshal Park, a New Zealander, was originally the commander of the British Air Forces in Central Asia. That position is now succeeded by Deputy Marshal Medhurst.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Air Defense Preparations to Prevent Indiscriminate Enemy Bombing</h3>
<p>As the war situation becomes more urgent, enemy air raids are bound to become more frequent. On the day the U.S. Air Force completely destroys them, there will naturally be no need to worry, but today we must temporarily endure enemy air raids. Allied land, sea, and air forces are intensifying their efforts to overthrow enemy air force bases, destroy their equipment, and cut off their transportation. However, it is very difficult to ensure that not a single enemy plane enters the skies over Shanghai and other major cities, and it is also expected that the U.S. Air Force will indiscriminately bomb in the future. We must be adequately vigilant.</p>
<p>Many residents of Shanghai believe, "The U.S. Air Force will absolutely not bomb Chinese residential areas. Bombing will mainly target Japanese military facilities and areas densely populated by Japanese, such as Hongkou, so there is no need to worry." It is unknown how this erroneous view arose, but in any case, it is foolish nonsense. Have not the U.S. planes' air raids so far been a blind bombardment of places without any Japanese military facilities? As a result, haven't many innocent civilians lost their lives, property, and homes for nothing? The randomness of enemy bombing can be understood by looking at the examples of Yuezhou, Changsha, Pukou, and Hankou, especially in Shanghai, where there are even more obvious examples. The British and Americans originally held racial discrimination against the Chinese. The British and Americans still harbor blatant contempt for Japan, an allied nation with equal or greater combat power than them, so what good impression do they have of China and the Chinese people? This is very obvious. In short, they always treat the Chinese as slaves. If they distribute benefits, they will take measures against colonies as in the past, as if they were livestock they keep, to be slaughtered at will. Know that the true enemies of the Orient are Britain and America. The invasions of the past by Britain and the exploitation by America are something the Chinese should reflect upon and carefully consider.</p>
<p>Enemy air raids also have a political effect. For example, they send one or two planes to invade Shanghai, carry out bombing, and kill civilians, hoping to increase the Chinese people's antipathy towards Japan. To put it plainly, they want to make the public think, "It's being bombed because the Japanese are here," and also create a fear of air raids among the public, in order to alienate China and Japan. In addition, of course, it also contains the propaganda effect that no matter how strict the air defense is, the strength of the U.S. Air Force is sufficient to break through it.</p>
<p>In this situation, what preparations do we have for air raids? Apart from a portion of organizations tasked with air defense, the general public has no preparations for air raids. How many people wearing air raid uniforms can you see on the streets of Shanghai? As for air raid shelters, they are not ready, shelters have not been clearly designated, and water for fire prevention is even more out of the question. In addition, there is almost no preparation for the emergency treatment of those who are unfortunately injured and for orderly evacuation.</p>
<p>In such a situation, if enemy planes carry out indiscriminate bombing, not only will houses collapse and family property be lost, but individual lives cannot be guaranteed. To avoid this disaster, what should individuals do? I hope everyone, like our ally Japan, is constantly wary of enemy air raids, taking care at all times and preparing at all times. As for practical preparations, there are the following items:</p>
<p>(1) Wear air raid clothing: Chinese clothing is completely unsuitable for activities in emergencies and must be improved for agile movement. It is best to wear air raid clothing all day, for both men and women. Clothing that conforms to old customs and habits but is not suitable for the current situation should be quickly improved at this time to cope with air raids.</p>
<p>(2) Prepare air raid shelters: To protect precious lives when bombed, the best thing to do is to hide in an air raid shelter. Hiding in an air raid shelter, especially one with overhead cover, is much safer, and there are many examples of lives being saved as a result. Conversely, there are also many people who are killed by blast winds or crushed by collapsing houses because they do not flee into air raid shelters during air raids. Therefore, in peacetime, you should prepare an air raid shelter that you can entrust your own and your family's fate to.</p>
<p>(3) Fire prevention preparation: It is absolutely necessary to quickly extinguish lights during an air raid. Furthermore, you must prepare water and sand for extinguishing fires, as well as various other fire prevention preparations.</p>
<p>(4) Emergency treatment: To treat those who are unfortunately injured during an air raid, the treatment methods, first aid training, and subsequent handling must be fully studied and practiced on weekdays to prepare for emergencies.</p>
<p>In addition, to protect family property, it should be evacuated immediately. Under the enemy planes' blind bombing, the furniture, bedding, valuables, etc. that have been painstakingly prepared can be turned to ashes in one fell swoop. Moreover, it is not easy to replace a piece of furniture after it is lost today. If things are evacuated in advance, then even if a part is lost during an air raid, a part can still be preserved, so as not to end up with nothing. Of course, no place can be guaranteed to be safe when enemy planes indiscriminately bomb, but you must try your best to avoid letting yourself fall into a state of utter poverty.</p>
<p>When implementing the evacuation of "things," you should also think about the evacuation of "people." In densely populated cities, the elderly, young, men, and women who are enough to hinder activities in an emergency should be sent to the safer suburbs in advance to evacuate, so as not to become victims of indiscriminate enemy bombing.</p>
<p>The above explanation is simple, but it is all the measures that should be taken and the preparations that must be made under air raids. At present, most people are indifferent to air raids and unprepared, which is a great danger of inviting the greatest misfortune. The British and Americans will never protect the Chinese; they want to suppress, bomb, and kill us! Those who are still leisurely and unhurried when enemy planes are plotting to indiscriminately bomb are those who do not want life and property. We must trust the military power of our allies, but at the same time, we must prevent the enemy Americans from carrying out indiscriminate and cruel killings from the sky. This is really the greatest task that the country requires us to undertake. (Husband)</p>

<h3>Municipal Economic Bureau Informs Merchants and Residents to Cooperatively Suppress and Stabilize Prices, Do Not Illegally Raise Prices by Taking Advantage of the End of the Year</h3>
<p>Director Xu of the Municipal Economic Bureau, upon assuming office, immediately resolved to continue in-depth research on the problem of suppressing and stabilizing prices and to establish concrete and severe measures. Now, during this period of the Lunar New Year, to prevent merchants from taking the opportunity to raise prices, in addition to informing merchants and residents to abide by the laws and regulations on suppressing and stabilizing prices, he specially convened a discussion meeting with responsible persons of various industry associations, informing and urging member merchants to cooperate with the government to stabilize the people's livelihood policy and not to engage in illegal acts of raising market prices on their own. The general idea of the notice is as follows: "This bureau is the economic administrative center of the city. We have been actively organizing and implementing the various important policies of visiting festivals and people's food, suppressing and stabilizing prices, and managing materials, so as to ensure that the national economy and the people's livelihood are protected. However, how to facilitate transportation, smooth the source, crack down on hoarding, and match supply and demand is not only within the Bureau's planning, but also depends on the efforts and assistance of the citizens to promote perfection and achieve expected results. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, the citizens are accustomed to purchasing New Year's goods, and the buying and selling transactions in the commercial market are also the busiest at this time. At this time, we should share the difficulties together and not take advantage of the end of the year to raise prices, disrupt the market, and violate the government's intention to balance prices. It is hoped so."</p>
<p>Hope the Authorities Will Enforce Price Limits</p>
<p>The general price level in this city once fell due to the Municipal Government's adjustment of institutions and Mayor Zhou's declaration of his determination to suppress the rise in prices. However, recently, with the approach of the Lunar New Year, the general price level has gradually risen again, especially the prices of vegetables, fresh meat, and northern and southern goods, which have risen even more sharply, affecting the daily life of citizens deeply and significantly. The general public hopes that the price evaluation authorities will promptly assess general prices, strictly enforce them, and stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Seventh-Period Household Coal Briquettes on Sale Starting Today, Materials Allocation Office Explains Reasons for Price Increase</h3>
<p>Household coal briquettes in the old 1st and 8th districts of this city will be distributed from the 6th to the 19th of this month (sales will be suspended from the 13th to the 16th for the Spring Festival holiday). Each person can purchase five catties with a voucher, at a price of 175 yuan, which is a considerable increase compared to the previous distribution price. In order to understand the reasons for the price increase, the reporter specially consulted the person in charge of the Materials Allocation Office, who said that the increase in the price of household coal briquettes this period is purely due to the excessive cost of raw material sources and transportation. The relevant authorities have repeatedly discussed and carefully decided. The quality and composition of the coal briquettes after the price increase meet the standards, and they do contain 50% coal dust. It has been verified several times that there are no errors, and all retail outlets are strictly prohibited from mixing and exchanging them. In addition to ordering the samples to be placed in bottles and displayed in conspicuous places for comparison, citizens are requested to pay attention to whether the coal briquettes they purchase are consistent with the samples when purchasing with vouchers. If any mixing or exchange is found, they can immediately report to the allocation office for investigation, and it has been earnestly announced and made known.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhou's Political and Personal Health is not Good</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhou Fohai of this city has been suffering from a cold since taking office due to the heavy burden of handling government affairs. After medical treatment, the fever has subsided, but it has not completely cleared. Following the doctor's instructions, he must rest, so he will not receive any visiting guests.</p>
<h3>Population Statistics for the Urban Area of This City</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the authorities of the Household Registration Office of the Police Bureau of this city, the population statistics for the urban area of this city for December of last year, excluding the newly merged district's population, which is being re-examined and has not yet been included, are as follows: Huangpu District: 107,745 people; Laozha District: 142,420 people; Xincheng District: 333,547 people; Jing'an District: 78,692 people; Jiangmi District: 135,785 people; Putuo District: 112,172 people; Taishan District: 287,291 people; Lujiiawan District: 211,576 people; Changshu District: 173,600 people; Huashan District: 207,437 people; and Changning District: 168,596 people.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Calculating Postage Odd Numbers</h3>
<p>The postal authorities have announced in Notification No. 142 that the implementation of a 150% increase in postage fees will be implemented from January 20th of this year. It is now stipulated that for postage fees obtained based on the aforementioned percentage increase, if there are odd numbers of less than one yuan, the method of rounding up to a number will be as follows: those below two jiao will not be calculated, those from two jiao to five jiao will be changed to five jiao, and those above six jiao will be changed to one yuan. Therefore, the following fees should be paid according to the new regulations. The public is requested to pay attention. (Attached table)</p>
<p>(Newspapers) First-Class (Local) First Category (per 100 cubic centimeters) 1.5 yuan, Second Category (per 100 cubic centimeters) (charged at 60%)</p>
<p>(Printed Matter and Trade Contracts, etc.) First-Class (Local) (weight 2 kg to 3 kg) 36.5 yuan.</p>

<p>(Books, Printed Matter, and Trade Contracts, etc.) Second, Fourth-Class (Out-of-Town) - (Japan, Korea, Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, Hong Kong) (weight not exceeding 100 cubic centimeters) 6.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Dark Side of the Wharf is Still Heavy, the Scalpers are Exceptionally Active</h3>
<p>Since the incident, this city has been in an unprecedented deformed state due to the fact that social, political, and economic aspects have not been fully straightened out. Such as black market ticket sales at the station, the "black hats" and "red hats" falsely claiming authority, the "scalpers" filling the docks and rampant, extortion, and the public extortion of police officers along the way, is obvious, known to women and children, laughing at home and abroad, and cannot be denied. Since Mayor Zhou took office, his prestige has spread, and villains have retreated. The police officers' long-standing habits have gradually been kept to themselves due to the authorities' strict management and improved treatment, and the order at the station has also improved due to strict supervision. In order to understand the general situation of the wharf at present, the Central News Agency reporter went to the Bund area for an inspection yesterday (5th) morning. Now, the observations obtained will be reported to the people concerned. The reporter arrived at Pier 12 at more than 11:00 yesterday morning. At that time, the ticket office of the China Shipping Company was selling tickets to Xingang at the window. Passengers lined up to buy tickets, and the order seemed to be good, but the "scalpers" were still exceptionally active. These guys seemed to be in contact with the company's staff, soliciting passengers and buying black market tickets. The gang members openly stood at the front of the line of purchasing passengers, stirring up the purchase of tickets and asking for very high prices, so that those who abided by the order waited for several hours and still failed to obtain them. They could only sigh helplessly. The police officers on duty there not only did not come forward to maintain order and stop the activities of villains, but also turned a blind eye. The company's employees were also busy entering and exiting the ticket office, soliciting bribes and purchasing on their behalf. Tickets with a face value of 1,300 yuan were raised to 1,600 or even more than 2,000 yuan. Such dereliction of duty is particularly noteworthy. It is hoped that the competent authorities will quickly take strict measures to eliminate long-standing malpractices and benefit merchants and travelers.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Abolishes the Title of Specialist</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Police Bureau implemented institutional adjustments and personnel reorganization on February 1st to increase work efficiency. It is learned that Director Zhou, who is also the director of the bureau, issued a hand decree yesterday (5th), ordering the dismissal of Gao Guanchen, Qian Borun, Ding Zhengyan, Xiang Rang, Xing Naiyong, Ma Ping, Li Zhenhuan, Zhao Xuantang, Tang Jian, Shao Jingfan, Yang Xian, Lan Yisu, Wang Guishan, Shen Xiongfei, and Xu Fengshu, 15 specialists without actual work, and waiting for other appointments.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Works Bureau Bureau Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau held its first bureau affairs meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (5th). The chief secretary of the bureau, the section chiefs of various sections, and technicians were present. First, Director Xu elaborated on the purpose of the meeting and discussed in detail the various work plans that the bureau should promote and reform in the future. Then, each material provided opinions, and it ended at about 5:00 p.m. It is learned that the bureau has decided on the outline of various work plans to be implemented in the next six months and will implement them step by step in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw and Pedicab Operators Arbitrarily Raise Fares</h3>
<p>Recently, as the Municipal Public Works Bureau reduced the number of tram services for both rickshaws and pedicabs, and transportation was scarce, operators arbitrarily raised fares. This caused an invisible increase in transportation costs for the general public. After investigation by the bureau, it was discovered that rickshaw and pedicab companies, taking advantage of the change in municipal government and the Public Works Bureau's internal restructuring, illegally and arbitrarily increased fares. It is reported that the previously approved daily rental for a rickshaw was 400 yuan, but it was increased to 800 yuan. The approved daily rental for a pedicab was 1,500 yuan, but it was raised to 3,000 yuan. Under this upper-level exploitation, pedicab and rickshaw pullers then arbitrarily raised their prices. The bureau is now conducting a thorough investigation and will severely punish any illegal businesses once evidence is found.</p>
<h3>Monthly Sales of Stamps in Shanghai Reaches Ten Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau stated that since the Ministry of Finance announced the implementation of the revised Stamp Tax Law for Emergency Periods on July 15th of last year, the bureau has actively promoted it. With the supervision of the Tax Affairs Administration and the conscientious investigation of the investigation department, major factories, companies, and stores in Shanghai are generally able to understand that stamps are an important national tax. All ledgers, receipts, and invoices are mostly affixed with stamps. However, many smaller shops often use count slips instead of invoices, deliberately avoiding affixing stamps. It is reported that the bureau is working to correct this. As a result, monthly sales have reached as much as seven or eight million yuan, which is incomparable to the previous monthly sales of only four or five hundred thousand yuan. If continuous improvement can be made in the future, the sales figures should be even more impressive.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Announces School Calendar for the Current Semester</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, in accordance with the Ministry of Education's order and the revised regulations on school year, semester, and holiday dates, drafted the school calendar for primary and secondary schools for the 33rd year last autumn. This was submitted to the Municipal Government and then to the Ministry of Education for approval and record. It is now learned that the bureau will issue this school calendar to all schools for compliance. The school calendar for the next semester is as follows: February 1st is the beginning of the second semester of the 33rd year.

<h3>After Seeing "Narcissus"</h3>
<p>— Shu Jun</p>
<p>The play "Narcissus" was written by Mr. Gu Zhongyi. It was performed at the Tian Gong Theater a few years ago and ran for dozens of days. It can be said to have been a great success. This time, it is being performed to raise funds for the home for the elderly, with the cooperation of artists such as Shi Hui, Tang Ruoqing, and Er Da, adding to its splendor. The rumors of using public service as a pretext are actually a great misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Narcissus is currently in season and is a must-have for every household. Although this flower is not as evergreen as pine and cypress, it blooms in the dead of winter and grows in the deep mountains and secluded valleys. It combines the purity and transcendence of plum and orchid with the solitary appreciation of chrysanthemums, giving people a sense of detachment. The play "Narcissus" also possesses this style, showing people the summons of justice and is indeed a drama worth seeing.</p>
<p>The entire play grasps the core well and is performed with tension. In the first two acts, set in the Tao family's living room, Ouyang Yingxian (played by Tang Ruoqing)'s innocence is quite pure and does not lose the style of a new woman. Tao Xiannan (played by Shi Hui)'s sad and brooding demeanor fully reveals his inner pain, and his expression is very profound, arousing the audience's sympathy. Wei Mali (played by Du Ping) only has money and power in her eyes and does not understand the true meaning of love. Her and her group of friends, who only seek material enjoyment, can be used as a critique of today's society. Sun Qiying's portrayal of the lawyer Mei is treacherous and cunning, and his expression is also quite thorough. In the third and fourth acts, set in Yingxian's cousin Jin Guangqing's home, Jin Guangqing (played by Chen Yulin) is a preacher, but he is rigid and inflexible. His inhumanity is performed vividly, causing the audience to laugh out loud. His lover, Miss Jiang (played by Li Li), also performs lively and exquisitely, and is petite and cute. In the final act, the dialogue and expression of Tao Xiannan after becoming impoverished, blind, and losing an arm are particularly profound and moving, similar to Qiu Haitang who is critically ill after being wounded. Shi Hui's performance can be described as thorough. Tang Ruoqing also achieves amazing results in this play.</p>
<p>It is said that this play is only being performed at the Lihua Theater for three days, and the run is short. Lovers of spoken drama, do not miss it.</p>

<p>St. John's Orchestra Wedding Services</p>
<p>The St. John's University student-organized Fan Wang Du Orchestra is now providing services for wedding celebrations to increase the total amount of the charity bazaar. All proceeds will be donated to the charity bazaar to rescue students out of school. The band is purely composed of St. John's University students who have studied music extensively and have been taught by various professors, so their performance is quite excellent. It is worth a try for people from all walks of life. On the one hand, you can have a novel wedding, and on the other hand, you can help students out of school. Isn't that killing two birds with one stone? We hope that all sectors will support and participate in this good cause. Contact at 83 Chongde Road (telephone 86507), deadline end of February.</p>

<h3>The Highly Notable "School Owners" Income Problem</h3>
<p>— Shen Li'er</p>
<p>Since the municipal education authorities announced the tuition fee increase standards on the 9th of last month, and considering the sudden sharp rise in general prices and the difficulties faced by various private primary and secondary schools, the fee standards were adjusted to double. Regarding this, one cannot but say that the education authorities have made great efforts to maintain the education sector under the current environment. However, in reality, there are indeed some private primary and secondary schools that adhere to the adjusted fee standards, but most private primary and secondary schools still collect fees according to their own standards, and their amounts often exceed the fee standards announced by the education bureau by several times. Leaving aside how the education bureau should deal with this problem to maintain the dignity of the law, it is highly concerning that "school owners," at a time when credit is extremely tight, are taking advantage of the opportunity to collect tuition fees to obtain huge amounts of cash. They may then use this as "hot money" to enter the speculative market, manipulate materials, cause prices to rise again, and reap huge profits. It seems that in order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, this deserves great attention.</p>
<p>According to the current tuition fees collected by general private primary and secondary schools, the average for primary schools is 15,000 yuan, and for secondary schools, it is 24,000 yuan. Taking the average for both primary and secondary schools as 20,000 yuan per person, then a private school principal with 300 primary and secondary school students will suddenly obtain 6 million yuan in cash within these few days. As for larger schools with student populations of over 2,000 (although schools with 2,000 students are not common, there are still four or five of them), the cash obtained would be over 40 million yuan. Even if those with reduced or free fees account for 20%, their income would still be no less than 30 million yuan. Although there are some who adopt flexible "installment payment methods" to take into account the difficulties of students' parents, these are ultimately a small minority. In essence, if this 30 million yuan in cash is used to enter the speculative and hoarding market, it will undoubtedly affect prices, which is an inevitable trend. In that case, the burden on people's lives will be further exacerbated, on top of the overlapping exploitation by profiteering merchants, by the "school owners" using hot money to seek profit, which is tantamount to "adding fuel to the fire" and "adding frost to snow." Even if we take a step back and say that the "school owners" may not be good at business or dare to personally enter the commercial battlefield, many will lend money at high interest rates to make profits. Recently, the "black market" overnight interest rate has reached 30%, and 30 million yuan in cash can be used to obtain 9 million yuan through the exploitative method of "deducting interest in advance." This 9 million yuan in heavy interest will then be multiplied and placed on the heavy burdens of ordinary people's lives through the hands of profiteers. Therefore, the "school owners" cannot but be suspected of indirectly contributing to the soaring prices. Faced with this issue, from the standpoint of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods, we propose the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Since the "school owners" have formed speculators similar to banks and money shops, the government authorities should supervise the "hot money activities" of the "school owners" in the same way that they supervise banks and money shops to prevent them from using their assets for speculation, according to the laws and regulations for ensuring people's livelihoods during wartime. When necessary, grant the "Financial Inspection Office" special powers to inspect the "economic actions" of the "school owners."</p>
<p>(2) All school teachers and staff should request that six months of salaries be paid at once, so that the hot money is "divided into smaller portions," so that the "school owners" cannot carry out large-scale speculation. Otherwise, teachers and staff should diligently monitor the "economic actions" of their principals and demand that their interest income from tuition fees be disclosed for public judgment.</p>
<p>(3) The education authorities should actively conduct audits of the income and expenditure accounts of various private schools, and the focus of their audits should not be on whether the distribution of salaries to teachers and staff meets the 75% ratio stipulated by the ministry, but should focus on the principals' use of high-interest lending methods to obtain huge profits.</p>
<p>(4) The public opinion sector should actively expose "school owners" who engage in speculation with tuition fee income, and persuade them with righteousness from a moral standpoint. Today's students' parents, unwilling to sit idly by and watch their children lose their education, often endure exploitation from high-interest loans to obtain tuition fees. If these funds are used to fuel soaring prices, it will indirectly increase the burden on students' parents again.</p>
<p>The above four points may not be entirely comprehensive, but in order to prevent the "school owners" from not devoting their efforts to their primary work and competing to profit from the price issue after the "red opening" of the lunar new year, we feel compelled to speak out. This issue affects not only the education sector, which is the foundation of the nation, but has also stepped out of the school gates and entered the broader lives of all Shanghai citizens. The seriousness of the situation is no longer just a matter of the lives of students, teachers and staff.</p>
<h3>A Double Loss</h3>
<p>— Jian Han</p>
<p>The once-heated issue of tuition fees has gradually subsided with the successive opening of schools at all levels. However, the impact of high tuition fees is gradually unfolding in society. Among them, the most obvious are the following two major problems:</p>
<p>First, the number of students in various schools has decreased significantly. Some have seen an 80% attendance rate, some 70% or 60%, and some even less than half. Where did these old students go? Apart from a small portion returning to their hometowns, most of them have dropped out of school! They were denied access to school because they could not afford the tuition fees. In the eyes of the "school owners," they should not have the right to education.</p>
<p>Second, a large number of teachers in various schools have also become unemployed. Business in ordinary stores is slow, and expenses are difficult to cover. The only solution is to lay off employees. Large and small "school shops" are no exception. For example, Xicheng Elementary School in this city dismissed six teachers at the same time. Regardless of their past achievements or teaching performance, the only reason is that the number of students has decreased and the number of classes has been reduced. Imagine, under the current situation of rising living costs, where can they find a way to survive once they lose their jobs? Riding the same boat and sharing weal and woe simply does not exist in the minds of the "school owners."</p>
<p>Increasing tuition fees, causing students to drop out of school and teachers to become unemployed, is truly a double loss! However, the "school owners" suffer no losses at all. At this time when students dropping out of school and unemployed teachers are left with nothing to do but laugh and cry, they can take a large amount of cash and use it as funds for their freelance and company businesses!</p>
<p>Increasing tuition fees benefits the principals, harms the teachers, and burdens the students! (Contributions to help unemployed teachers)</p>

<h3>Field Yellow Stone Inkstone and "Pullover呢" Charity Sale for Benevolent Purposes</h3>
<p>(1) Mr. Qian Peirong wrote: "Respectfully, I have witnessed the increasing number of bodies of soldiers and civilians lying on the road, and the countless hidden poor who are hungry, cold, and without food or clothing. I have also seen the urgent appeals from your organization and the Xinwenbao newspaper for assistance with education loans, as well as the generous donations from people in society. I am ashamed of my meager financial resources and unable to provide much assistance. Fortunately, I have a field yellow ancient inkstone at home, measuring four and a half inches in length, three and a half inches in width, and half an inch in thickness. It is bright and flawless, and rarely matched. I am now willing to part with it and donate the proceeds of the charity sale of 300,000 yuan to aid education and charity. I am now transferring this inkstone to your organization for receipt. I hope you will promote it widely. I believe there are many great philanthropists in Shanghai who will come forward to assist. Please donate it in the name of that philanthropist. I respectfully present my humble intentions and hope for your consideration."</p>
<p>(2) Chong Qiao Ni Rong Company wrote to this office: "Respectfully, your organization hosts various charitable endeavors, helping the poor and rescuing the distressed. I have always admired this and often thought of donating funds to help our compatriots in need, but circumstances have not allowed it, which I have always felt sorry for. Seeing the rising prices and the countless hidden poor who are without support, how can I bear to turn a blind eye? I am now offering an English-made ADC 'Pullover 呢' set for charity sale. At the current market value, wholesale prices among traders are at least 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per yard. If sold to customers, it would certainly be more than this amount. Assuming it is sold for 300,000 yuan, please use 100,000 yuan as small loan funds, 100,000 yuan as assistance funds for poor women giving birth, and 100,000 yuan as medical assistance funds for elementary school teachers, as a small contribution to relief. I respectfully present my humble intentions and hope for your consideration."</p>

<h3>Returning Unaccepted Money to Rescue the Poor</h3>
<p>Xiao Guangdong wrote to this office: "I, under the name of Xiao Guangdong, have a beef noodle stall located east of the Asian Hotel on Six Shanghai Road. On the 31st of last month, a customer left behind a leather wallet containing 7,000 yuan in cash and a business card of Zheng Yaquan. I picked it up at the time and do not know who it belongs to, so I have kept it for collection. Unexpectedly, the next day, Mr. Zheng came back to order. After talking, I realized that it was the person I was looking for. He showed his citizen's card, and it was correct. Therefore, I returned the wallet to him. Mr. Zheng was also generous. Overjoyed at the return of his property, he insisted on giving me 2,000 yuan as a reward. I refused, but he would not take it back. How could I accept it peacefully? Therefore, I dare to send the full amount to your organization and donate 1,000 yuan each to your small loan fund and your elderly care home, to create blessings for Mr. Zheng."</p>

Recently, we received 200,000 yuan from the Shanghai Catholic Charity Association, which was raised by Mr. Xue Zuheng and transferred by Mr. Tang Shuming from his daughter's engagement gifts, with 100,000 yuan for the Anlao Hospital and 100,000 yuan for the Tushanwan Orphanage.
