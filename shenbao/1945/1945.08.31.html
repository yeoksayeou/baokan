<p>關於美軍遣赴上海問題，魏氏答稱，在一切情况未達安全么前，吾人決不遺送任何軍隊至上海區域，　中國戰區內之日軍，尙未在南京簽訂投降協定也。魏氏在此鄭重宣稱，美國政府之政策並無改變，余之任務在協助中國重新布置其軍隊至解放區域及遣散並解除日軍之武裝是也。對作戰以外之任務，政府並未授權與余。</p>
<p>記者詢以美國是否參加在南京之日軍投降簽字典禮，魏氏答稱，蓋此爲中國戰區中國軍民苦戰八年，現應有充分的功績與光榮，而負責接受敵軍之投降。雖然，在典禮中美國及各盟國均將有代表出席也，美國代表爲麥克魯將軍，至於敵人投降問題，魏氏聲稱並未遭遇任何困難。</p>

<p>記者詢以中國軍隊是否巳進入廣州，魏氏答稱：中國軍隊正向廣州進軍，惟該處敵軍巳準備投降</p>
<p>關於美軍遣散返國問題，魏將軍答覆時稱：美國軍隊返國問題甚爲複雜，具體計劃須俟陸軍部決定，但大規模遣散軍隊返國，須俟海上運輸恢復後方能實現。目前僅有一小部軍隊集中昆明，準備赴印緬區，然後候機會返美</p>

<p>重慶三十日電　據美新聞處紐約二十九日電，日軍一九四一年十二月七日對珍珠港及夏威夷附近軍事及海軍設備之偸擊，不僅引起美國參加全球性之戰爭，且使美國對於引起珍珠港事件之各種事實從而研究其究竟。日軍偸襲珍珠港之全部結果，美國爲安全起見，當時暫未宣布，一年以後，海軍部宣布日軍巳暫使美戰鬥艦八艘及夏威夷之大部飛機失去效用，美艦沉或創者　共十九艘，某種海岸設備亦被創，但是時大部被創之軍艦均巳隨艦隊回美，海軍機損失八十架，陸軍機損失九十七架，海軍及海軍陸戰隊損失兩千一百十七人，失踪者九百六十人，受傷者八百七十六人，陸軍損失二百二十六人，受傷者三百九十六人。前海軍部長諾克斯　即飛往珍珠港，渠於被擊後一週所作之報告內，責該區司令溺職，由美最高法院法官羅伯斯爲首之五人委員會，於一九四二年所提出之調查報吿內，亦證實陸海司令有玩忽職守之罪。太平洋艦隊司令基末爾海軍中將與夏威夷陸軍司令　特一級上將遂均免職，但未正式提出罪狀。陸軍部與海軍部均主張，於公共利益與安全所允許之某一時期，應舉行正式之審判，是時另由陸軍部長與海軍部長指定組織一特別調査委員會，獨立進行調査。去年十二月一日，彼等提出報告，巳改變以前應將上述兩溺職官員交軍事法庭審訊之主張，僅稱當時由於「判斷錯誤」，由目前之證據觀察，美國尚未考慮對彼等再加懲罰。</p>

<h3 id="c16">中宣部記者招待會　陳軍政部長談話　努力奮勉保持勝利條件 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>中央社重慶二十九日電　軍政部陳誠部長，二十九日下午四時出席中宣部記者招待愈，發表談話，對我國抗戰所以勝利，不外　最高統帥決策正確，立塲堅定，　我國軍民不斷　牲奮鬥，　盟邦尤其在華美軍會不斷作莫大援助。陳氏　稱，勝利雖得，但保持勝利條件尚多，如不努力奮勉，不但對不起最高統帥與盟邦，因由於其領導人決策的錯誤，然而就原子彈威力亦爲失敗原因，蘇參戰亦爲主因之一也。尙有優點不可忽視者，　日敵官兵作戰的忠勇，　即在投降後，敵人還是服從命令，注意紀律，因之我們得到勝利，尙需與盟邦精誠合作，共同維持世界永久和平，否則敵人有再起可能。要知敵武器雖巳解除，但其陸軍傷亡不大，其恢復猶恐較第一次大戰後爲迅速。</p>
<p>今後整軍三項要求</p>
<p>陳氏次論及今後之整軍問題稱，日投降後，全國對整軍問題仍甚關切，本人認爲整軍無論平時或戰時都屬重要，應知我們雖傾全國之力，猶本足養三百個師，我們全國的壯丁，不能均置之於軍隊中，任其吃不飽而　民，錢亦不能都用於軍隊，故今後整軍工作自當更加積極。開於整軍要求，陳氏謂：第一，要做到軍政·軍令統一。第二，軍隊是保障國防安全的，不是保人升官發財的工具。第三，編制·訓練·裝備·補給·方面，要做到現代化，即精兵主義。至編餘官兵的處置，自整軍開始到今年一月，巳裁去三十個軍，約八十個師，人數在百萬以上，經過情形尚　良好。</p>
<p>編餘官兵應使生產編餘官兵體國忠公，服從命令之精神，對國家的貢獻，可與在前方流血作戰相媲美，無論在精神上，物質上，我們應當予以相同待遇。戰後設法使之由消費變爲生產，如實行總理之工兵政策。總之，政府不使有一人流離失所。此次本人赴西南·東南八省視察，會晤及三個方面軍司令，四個戰區軍官，言談間得悉官兵等對整軍用意均巳明瞭，凡經按照中央規定整編各部隊，巳一律同等待遇，整編前部隊每一士兵月支僅五十元，整編後可得九百元，未整編前，士兵每人伙食及食費爲九百元至一千元，整編後爲三千六百元至一萬元。關於兵器，陳部長認爲，在整軍後必須力求劃一，不然補給十分困難，主要兵器必須自給自足。</p>
<p>派赴日本佔領軍力</p>
<p>陳氏談話畢，有詢及我派赴佔領日本本土之軍力是否巳確定，陳氏答稱，正在研究軍力之多少，胥視需要而定。記者詢問戰後應如何處置榮譽軍人，陳答此項計劃正審核中，榮譽軍人中全殘廢者，政府保其生計，半殘廢者，則分別予以適宜工作。記者又詢及美租借法案物資停止供應，此對戰事關係如何，陳答稱，依照該法規定，戰爭結束後應停止執行，故美政府停供租借法案物資，原屬合法之舉，今後吾人如有求，則可依照借款交換等方式取得。</p>
<p>長江水雷所餘不多</p>
<p>記者詢以長江內掃雷工作進行如何，陳氏答謂，據個人所知，長江上游水雷所留不多，本人（陳自稱）任職第六戰區時，曾有長江布雷之工作，初甚有效，敵船被沉者頗多，後敵人查覺防範甚嚴，水雷所餘不多，下游方面，敵船不斷往來，且有夜間行駛，即可明證水雷不多，惟吾人自應再加掃除，以免不測。</p>
<p>中蘇締約意義深遠</p>
<p>中央社重慶三十日電　軍政部長陳誠，頃對中蘇友好同盟條約發表談話稱：據個人看來，此約關係重要，意義至爲深遠。中蘇同盟不僅可以奠定東亞之和平，且亦可以維持全世界之和平，　此項條約實可以制止敵人侵略之企圖也，但吾人自身切不可因和平有保障而圖苟安，反之，更應努力，庶幾方可確保世界之和平。蘇聯本係愛好和平之國家，此次大戰，係因德國侵略蘇聯，不得巳而應戰，且戰爭中蘇聯犧牲頗大，因此蘇聯　要和平，更爲迫切，而吾人亦應從此努力，發奮自強，庶不負此約之締結。</p>

Approximately 2,000 occupation troops arrived in Yokohama today. The headquarters of General Carl A. Spaatz, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces; General George Kenney, Commanding General of the Far East Air Forces; Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger, Commanding General of the Eighth Army; and Major General Ennis Whitehead, Commanding General of the Fifth Air Force, are also located in the Grand Hotel. Other officers are residing in the vicinity of the Kanagawa Prefecture Government Office. The Japanese government's Central Liaison Office also established a branch office in Yokohama today due to General MacArthur's establishment of his headquarters there.</p>
<p>Atsugi Airfield, 30th – General MacArthur landed in Japan today, personally commanding nearly 40,000 occupation troops. These troops have raised the American flag at the two largest naval base airfields in Japan and in the two large areas of Tokyo Bay. Upon stepping off the transport plane at Atsugi Airfield, MacArthur stated that the surrender plan was proceeding extremely smoothly, and that all current indications suggest that the occupation work will not involve friction or bloodshed. Currently, reinforcements for the Allied occupation forces are continuously arriving from both sea and air, under the cover of artillery from 2,000 aircraft and hundreds of warships. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel are landing with full combat equipment to guard against Japanese treachery. However, no conflicts have occurred; Japanese officers are respectful and courteous, and the Japanese people are extremely docile.</p>
<p>Chongqing, 30th – According to a Tokyo broadcast on the 30th, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Occupation Forces, stated upon arriving at Atsugi Airfield at 2:05 PM today: "From Melbourne to Tokyo, it has been a long and arduous journey, but this arduous journey seems to have been rewarded." MacArthur was welcomed by Allied and Japanese reporters upon arriving at the airfield. He also issued a statement saying that the surrender plan is now proceeding very smoothly according to the predetermined steps, and that fighting has almost completely ceased in all remote war zones. In this area, 300,000 Japanese soldiers have been disarmed and disbanded.</p>

<p>Allied Aircraft Roar into the Sky, Forming an Aerial Bridge</p>
<p>Chongqing, 30th – According to a Tokyo Allied News Agency broadcast on the 30th, Reuters noted that its reporter, Rubin, arrived in Tokyo this morning. Due to difficulties with telecommunications, he requested this agency to forward his report. He is one of the first four war correspondents from the Allied side to arrive in Tokyo. His report is as follows: On average, one Allied aircraft is landing at this airfield every two minutes, and simultaneously unloading and taking off, so that troops and supplies can continuously pour into this "beachhead" without obstructing air traffic. The first Japanese sight that catches the eyes of the soldiers in the plane is Mount Fuji, which stands tall in clear weather. After dawn today, a clear blue sky welcomed them, and Allied aircraft roared into the sky from the airfields of Okinawa, averaging one every two minutes. This air transport team thus formed a bridge reaching Atsugi Airfield.</p>

<h3 id="e5">General Wedemeyer Speaks to Reporters; Answers Various Military Inquiries <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing, 30th – General Albert Wedemeyer, Chief of Staff of the China Theater and Commander of U.S. Forces in China, held a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters at the U.S. military headquarters at 3:30 PM today. Wedemeyer did not make any statements, but only answered the questions raised by reporters. Key points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of sending U.S. troops to Shanghai, Wedemeyer replied that we will not send any troops to the Shanghai area until all circumstances have reached a safe point, and the Japanese troops within the China Theater have not signed the surrender agreement in Nanjing. Wedemeyer solemnly declared here that the policy of the U.S. government has not changed, and my mission is to assist China in redeploying its troops to the liberated areas and disarming and disbanding the Japanese military. The government has not authorized me to perform tasks other than combat.</p>
<p>When a reporter asked whether the United States would participate in the Japanese surrender signing ceremony in Nanjing, Wedemeyer replied that this is because the Chinese military and civilians in the China Theater have fought hard for eight years, and should now have full merit and glory to be responsible for accepting the surrender of the enemy. However, the United States and all Allied countries will have representatives present at the ceremony. The U.S. representative is General McClure. As for the issue of the enemy's surrender, Wedemeyer stated that he had not encountered any difficulties.</p>
<p>When a reporter asked how many planes would be needed to transport Chinese troops to various locations, Wedemeyer stated that it was difficult to give a specific number of planes, and the most difficult thing was the inconvenience of transporting fuel, but Chairman Chiang was determined to use any means to ensure that Chinese troops were quickly transported to designated areas.</p>
<p>Regarding the redeployment of U.S. troops, Wedemeyer replied that only an advance unit had advanced to the Nanjing area, but the redeployment of large numbers of troops would have to wait until later.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer discussed the issue of the surrender in Hong Kong, saying that British troops accepting the surrender were from the Pacific Theater and were anchored in Hong Kong's harbor awaiting orders. All surrenders within the China Theater, including Hong Kong and Vietnam, must wait until after the signing ceremony in Nanjing before proceeding. The surrender location in northern Vietnam will be held in either Kaiyuan or Haiphong, and Chairman Chiang will send a representative to accept it, while France will also send a representative to attend the ceremony. At this point, Wedemeyer announced that a prisoner-of-war camp had recently been discovered in Thailand, containing several Chinese and American prisoners.</p>
<p>When a reporter asked whether Chinese troops had entered Guangzhou, Wedemeyer replied that Chinese troops were advancing towards Guangzhou, but the enemy troops there were already prepared to surrender.</p>
<p>When answering questions about the repatriation of U.S. troops, General Wedemeyer stated that the issue of U.S. troops returning home was very complicated, and a concrete plan would have to wait for the Army Department to decide, but a large-scale repatriation of troops would have to wait until maritime transportation was restored. Currently, only a small number of troops are concentrated in Kunming, preparing to go to the India-Burma area, and then waiting for an opportunity to return to the United States.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer announced that the U.S. Navy was responsible for mine-clearing work in the Huangpu River area, while the British Navy was responsible for the Hong Kong area. Mine-clearing in the Wusong area is expected to be completed within the next week, and U.S. naval units will also travel up the Yangtze River to clear mines within the river, but the work will be more difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Truth About the Pearl Harbor Attack <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing, 30th – According to a U.S. Information Service dispatch from New York on the 29th, the Japanese military's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and military and naval facilities near Hawaii on December 7, 1941, not only caused the United States to participate in a global war, but also prompted the United States to study the facts that led to the Pearl Harbor incident. The full results of the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor were temporarily not announced by the United States for safety reasons. A year later, the Navy Department announced that the Japanese had temporarily rendered eight U.S. battleships and most of the aircraft in Hawaii ineffective. A total of 19 U.S. ships were sunk or damaged, and certain coastal facilities were also damaged. However, at that time, most of the damaged warships had already returned to the United States with the fleet. 80 naval aircraft were lost, 97 army aircraft were lost, 2,117 Navy and Marine Corps personnel were lost, 960 were missing, and 876 were injured. The Army lost 226 personnel, and 396 were injured. Former Secretary of the Navy Knox immediately flew to Pearl Harbor. In his report made one week after the attack, he blamed the commander of the area for dereliction of duty. A five-member commission headed by Supreme Court Justice Roberts also confirmed the guilt of the land and sea commanders in dereliction of duty in its investigation report submitted in 1942. Admiral Kimmel, Commander of the Pacific Fleet, and Lieutenant General Short, Commander of the Army in Hawaii, were both dismissed, but no formal charges were filed. The Army Department and the Navy Department both argued that a formal trial should be held at a certain time when public interests and safety allow. At that time, another special investigation committee was designated and organized by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy to conduct an independent investigation. On December 1 of last year, they submitted a report that had changed the previous argument that the two derelict officials should be handed over to a military court for trial, stating only that there was "an error in judgment" at the time. From the current evidence, the United States has not considered punishing them again.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Press Conference by the Ministry of Information - Minister of Military Administration Chen Speaks - Striving to Maintain Conditions for Victory <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th: Chen Cheng, Minister of Military Administration, attended a press conference held by the Ministry of Information at 4:00 PM on the 29th and made a statement. Regarding the reasons for China's victory in the War of Resistance, he stated it was due to: 1. The correct decisions and unwavering stance of the Supreme Commander. 2. The continuous sacrifice and struggle of the Chinese military and people. 3. The tremendous assistance provided by the Allied nations, especially the American forces in China. Chen stated that while victory has been achieved, there are still many conditions to maintain it. Failure to strive diligently would be a disservice to the Supreme Commander and the Allied nations. The error in judgement on the part of its leaders and the power of the atomic bomb were reasons for failure. The Soviet Union's participation in the war was also a major factor. However, certain advantages should not be overlooked: 1. The loyalty and bravery of the Japanese officers and soldiers in combat. 2. Even after surrender, the enemy remained obedient to orders and attentive to discipline. Therefore, to maintain lasting world peace, we must cooperate sincerely with the Allied nations; otherwise, the enemy may rise again. It should be understood that while the enemy's weapons have been disarmed, its army did not suffer heavy casualties, and its recovery may be faster than after World War I.</p>
<p>Future Military Reorganization Requires Three Things</p>
<p>Chen then discussed the issue of future military reorganization, stating that after the Japanese surrender, the entire country remained very concerned about this issue. He believes that military reorganization is important in both peacetime and wartime. It should be understood that even if we dedicate the full strength of the nation, it would be insufficient to support 300 divisions. We cannot put all the able-bodied men in the country into the military, leaving them unfed, nor can we spend all the money on the military. Therefore, future military reorganization must be carried out more actively. Regarding the requirements for military reorganization, Chen stated: First, military administration and military command must be unified. Second, the military should be a tool to ensure national defense and security, not a tool for personal promotion and wealth. Third, modernization is required in terms of organization, training, equipment, and supply, that is, a lean and efficient military. Regarding the disposal of demobilized officers and soldiers, from the start of military reorganization until January of this year, 30 armies, approximately 80 divisions, have been cut, totaling over one million people, and the process has been going well.</p>
<p>Demobilized Officers and Soldiers Should be Enabled to Produce</p>
<p>The spirit of patriotism and obedience to orders demonstrated by demobilized officers and soldiers is comparable to the contribution of those who shed blood on the front lines. They should be given the same treatment, both materially and spiritually. After the war, efforts should be made to transform them from consumers into producers, such as implementing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's policy of soldier-laborers. In short, the government will not allow anyone to become displaced. During my inspection of eight provinces in the Southwest and Southeast, I met with the commanders of three field armies and the officers of four war zones. In our conversations, I learned that the officers and soldiers understood the purpose of military reorganization. All units reorganized according to the central government's regulations have received the same treatment. Before reorganization, each soldier received only 50 yuan per month; after reorganization, they receive 900 yuan. Before reorganization, the food and expenses for each soldier ranged from 900 to 1,000 yuan; after reorganization, they are 3,600 to 10,000 yuan. Regarding weaponry, Minister Chen believes that after military reorganization, uniformity must be strived for, otherwise, supply will be very difficult. The main weapons must be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Dispatching Forces to Occupy Japan</p>
<p>After Minister Chen finished speaking, he was asked whether the number of troops we would send to occupy mainland Japan had been determined. Chen replied that the amount of troops was still being studied and would depend on the needs. A reporter asked how veteran soldiers should be treated after the war. Chen replied that this plan was under review. The government would guarantee the livelihood of those with complete disabilities, while those with partial disabilities would be given appropriate jobs. A reporter also asked how the suspension of supplies under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act would affect the war. Chen replied that according to the regulations of the act, it should be suspended after the end of the war. Therefore, the U.S. government's suspension of supplies under the Lend-Lease Act was legal. In the future, if we have any needs, we can obtain them through loans, exchanges, and other means.</p>

<p>A reporter asked how the mine-clearing work in the Yangtze River was progressing. Chen replied that, to the best of his knowledge, there were few remaining mines in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. When he (Chen referring to himself) was serving in the Sixth War Area, there was mine-laying work in the Yangtze River, which was very effective at first, and many enemy ships were sunk. Later, the enemy became aware and took strict precautions, and there were few remaining mines. In the lower reaches, enemy ships constantly traveled back and forth, and even sailed at night, which clearly proves that there were not many mines. However, we should still continue to clear them to avoid accidents.</p>
<p>The Sino-Soviet Treaty Has Far-Reaching Significance</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th: Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng recently made a statement on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, stating: In my opinion, this treaty is of great importance and far-reaching significance. The Sino-Soviet alliance can not only lay the foundation for peace in East Asia but also maintain world peace. This treaty can indeed prevent the enemy's attempts at aggression. However, we ourselves must not become complacent because peace is guaranteed. On the contrary, we should work harder to ensure world peace. The Soviet Union is a peace-loving country. This war was forced upon them by Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has suffered greatly during the war. Therefore, the Soviet Union's need for peace is even more pressing, and we should also work hard from now on and strive for self-improvement so as not to let down the conclusion of this treaty.</p>

<p>The Representative Office of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission in Shanghai and the Shanghai Military Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of representatives from various military agencies in the city at the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters at 10:00 AM yesterday. Representatives from the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, the Third War Area, the Military Intelligence Bureau, the Ministry of Military Operations, the Military Police, the Action Corps, and other units, totaling over thirty people, attended the meeting. After discussion, the following five urgent measures were decided:</p>
<p>Procedures for Borrowing Buildings</p>
<p>Each unit must follow specific procedures for borrowing office buildings and must not exceed the actual needs of the office. Those who have already borrowed buildings should maintain the status quo, but must immediately report the location of the building, the circumstances of the borrowing, and details to the Military Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>Regulations for Plainclothes Armed Personnel</p>
<p>Each unit must have regulations for plainclothes armed personnel and immediately inspect the issued weapons, including: 1. The name of the officer or soldier. 2. The type and serial number of the gun. 3. The number of bullets and two photos of the person carrying the gun. A form must be created and sent to the Military Commissioner's Office for review and verification, and a gun license must be issued. Anyone found carrying a gun without a license after this has been organized will be investigated and confiscated by the military police.</p>
<p>Applying for Car Licenses on Behalf of Others</p>
<p>Recently, unlicensed cars have been found driving in the city, which seriously hinders public safety. If any agency has a car without a license, they can immediately apply for a license and send it to the Military Commissioner's Office to be processed on their behalf.</p>
<p>Establish a Temporary Liaison Office</p>
<p>Due to the current needs of the city, a temporary liaison office for the various military agencies stationed in Shanghai should be established to ensure consistent action.</p>
<p>Report Irregular Conduct</p>
<p>Each unit should report any past actions taken in other’s names or beyond regulation. Once verified, they will be severely punished. (Daguang News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Smooth Progress in Discussions for Airport Arrangements - Large Numbers of Airborne Troops Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>After more than 80 officers and men of the Second Air Force Area Command arrived in Shanghai by plane the day before yesterday, they temporarily stationed at the Dachang Airport. The Command Headquarters was also located in the barracks on the east side and has already begun work. They are in contact with the Japanese side to arrange the airport in order to allow a large number of airborne troops to land. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Colonel Tokawa, commander of the Japanese Air Force in the Shanghai area, visited Commander Zhang Jie of the Second Area Command to discuss matters for about an hour. It is understood that the talks between Commander Zhang and the Japanese side over the past two days have been very good.</p>
<p>Commander Zhang Speaks</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Commander Zhang yesterday afternoon to inquire about the progress of the talks with the Japanese side. According to him: "After arriving in Shanghai by plane yesterday morning, I (Zhang referring to himself), together with Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xuemeng and Staff Officer Maekawa and Major Suzuki, who were sent by General Okamura, Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, met with Colonel Umezaki, commander of the Japanese naval aviation, for about two hours. At 4:00 PM, another formal meeting was held with the Japanese side. Colonel Tokawa, commander of the Japanese Air Force in the Shanghai area, sent Major Mori and five staff officers to attend. On the naval side, Colonel Umezaki sent Lieutenant Colonel Hiroki and another staff officer to attend. Staff Officer Maekawa and Major Suzuki, who were sent by Okamura, also participated in the meeting. The meeting lasted for two hours and ended at 6:00 PM. The atmosphere at the meeting was relatively harmonious, as the Japanese personnel deeply felt that their previous actions against us were wrong, so they had a very good feeling towards our air force coming to Shanghai. Since my arrival here, every meeting with the Japanese side has been very smooth. All handover matters can be completely resolved within a few days. Once the airport handover and arrangements are completed, our large number of airborne troops will land in Shanghai."</p>
<p>(Another report) Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xuemeng delayed his flight back to Nanjing until 8:00 AM yesterday due to business matters. Japanese Major Suzuki accompanied him.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Surplus of Air Raid Relief Funds Allocated to Scholarship <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Shen and Xin Two Newspapers Decide to Handle Similarly</p>
<p>The Scholarship Office of this newspaper will begin distributing scholarships from September 3rd. Elementary school students will receive 100,000 yuan each, junior high school students 150,000 yuan, senior high school and vocational school students 200,000 yuan, and university students 300,000 yuan. However, if the tuition fees of various schools are lower than these amounts, the actual amounts will still be issued. Based on the number of students receiving assistance this year, the 350 million yuan already raised will be allocated as much as possible, but there is still a shortfall of over 60 million yuan. This newspaper has consulted with the Xinwen Bao and decided to incorporate the surplus of air raid relief donations previously collected into the scholarship fund, with both newspapers handling it in the same way. Providing disaster relief and scholarships each have their significant meanings. Now that world peace has been restored and a bright future is here, disaster relief has become a thing of the past, while scholarships are urgently needed. This move to shift from what is no longer needed to what is urgently needed will surely be welcomed by donors from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to records, this newspaper collected a total of 376,066,700 yuan in air raid relief donations, plus 244,300 yuan in interest, totaling 376,311,000 yuan. Of this amount, 339,750,000 yuan was paid to the former "Citizens Welfare Association" (see the revenue and expenditure report in the Social Services section of this newspaper on August 15th). The remaining balance is 36,561,000 yuan. This amount will be incorporated into the scholarship fund for distribution. In addition, another 30 million yuan shortfall will be raised from all walks of life to meet urgent needs. The office stipulates that starting from September 3rd, a "Notice of Approval" will be issued. It is hoped that approved students from all schools will bring their slips and identification to the office to collect them on time, and they can use these slips to pay their tuition fees to their respective schools. The dates are as follows:</p>
<p>Date　Morning　Afternoon</p>
<p>September 3rd (Monday)　Senior Elementary School　Junior High 1</p>
<p>September 4th (Tuesday)　Junior High 2　Junior High 3</p>
<p>September 5th (Wednesday)　Senior High　University/Vocational</p>
<p>·Note· If approved students transfer to other schools or move up to a higher level in the next semester, they must report the details in writing as soon as possible, or consult in person at the office.</p>
