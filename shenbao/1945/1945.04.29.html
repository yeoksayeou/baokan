<h3>日首相官邸前晚擧行　陸海軍首腦會議　以必要具體措置應付戰局</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　鈴木首相於二十七日在官邸會同梅津參謀總長，及川軍令部總長，阿南陸相，米內海相，河邊參謀次長，小川軍令部次長，柴山陸軍，并上海軍兩次官等陸，海軍首腦部，關於陸·海軍在　終密切合作，並發揮戰力問題，作種種之懇談。關於此事，下村情報局總裁二十八日發表談話如次：四月二十七日晚，首相官邸舉行陸·海軍首腦者會議，討論關於戰爭必勝之方策，尤以陸海軍戰力之綜合與發揮問題，交換各種意見，並決定應付急迫之戰局，實行必要之具　措置。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日新內閣顧問，二十八日中午舉行首次會議，席上鈴木首相致詞，希望各顧問協力，繼由各顧問就顧問會議之運營方針等舉行懇談，下午二時散會。</p>
<h3>日航空部隊猛攻　沖繩機塲及艦船　五十八機動隊實力弱化</h3>
<p>南西羣島基地二十八日中央社電　日航空部隊，二十七日下午攻擊冲繼本島敵飛機場及四周敵艦船，投彈命中敵機塲，數處起火。又以魚雷擊中巡洋艦數艘，此外，並突入敵運輸船隊，予以大打擊。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　琉球海域之日航空特攻隊，雖受天氣之阻碍，仍盡量發揮强大之威力，而使敵軍之侵略企圖受阻。敵機動部隊現已顯然弱北，即第五十八機動部隊，最初擁有戰艦十餘艘，空母二十餘幾，而為極有力之艦隊，敵軍依靠如此絕對優勢，急圖制壓琉球本島，以便迅速設定强固之睦上航空基地，但由於日航空隊全體之猛烈攻擊，致使敵之企圖崩潰。據截至十七日止之大本營發表，敵軍已被擊沉航空母艦十二艘，擊沉或擊毀二艘，擊毀七艘，共計二十一艘，又戰艦十九艘及其他戰鬥用艦船多數被擊沉或擊毀。因此，第五十八機動部隊攻擊力，殆已失其半數以上，尤其航空母艦之殘留琉球海域僅餘五艘。又琉球本島北中各飛機塲及慶良間飛機塲，亦因受日軍攻擊，致其使用顯受限制，故今後敵第五十八機動部隊積極的大規模之航空攻擊，已全屬不可能也。</p>
<h3>日皇行幸靖國神社</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日皇二十八日焉幸靖國神社，躬親禮拜山本元帥等四萬一千三百十八名新祭神及護國英靈，是晨八時四十分，陸·海軍兩省官員及鈴木宮司以下，均在九段神域恭候，阿南陸相，米內海相以次各陸·海軍關係官員，亦於拜殿階前恭迎，日皇御陸軍軍裝，牵同藤田侍從長，松平宮相，運沼侍從武官長，加藤行幸主務官等，於九時三十分乘車安抵靖國神社，由陸·海兩相前導，進本殿親拜，拜畢於各員恭送中返駕。</p>
<h3>東京加强防空態勢</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　東京都警視應為應付敵機轟炸都市，激揚民眾士氣，特對保甲防空班規定四要點，分飭轄區內各署遵照辦理，　振起敢鬥精神，　澈底限制逃避及指導防火工作，　設優完善之貯物地窟，　澈底實施消防訓練等四項。</p>
<p>台灣泗水空襲</p>
<p>台北二十七日中央社電　二十七日零時許至侵晨止，敵大型機七八架分數批侵入台北地區，在淡水附近投彈後逸去。</p>
<p>爪加爾達二十七日中央社電　B24型敵機三架，二十四日下午九時三十分許，侵入泗水地區，經日軍高射砲火猛擊，有二架冒火逸去，大致已被擊落，日方無損害。</p>
<h3>敵美今後之困難　船舶不足為致命傷</h3>
<p>最近，美聯合艦隊司令兼海軍作戰部長金格，在接見新聞記者團時，會面有得色的銳：「美國在不足四年之間，已於大西洋上三千浬，太平洋上（至菲律賓·馬里亞納）七千　的海面，架成船舶之樹。可是，最困難的任務尚在今後。」自從美陸戰隊踏上硫黃島，馬紹爾麾下重整旗鼓的第五十八機動部隊空襲日本時起，美國的輿論早就高呼進攻日本。果然隔不多久，令格·尼米資以下，甚至維特瑪亞也出席參加，宣稱「為協商今後太平洋新作戰起見」，在本國召集陸海軍首腦舉行作戰會議。會中對於金格所謂「船舶之機」的强度，目然是討諭焦點之一。</p>
<p>美船舶不敷</p>
<p>美國去年末的船舶保有量，據愛莫里·朗特的報告，共有五·六三三艘，其總噸數約三千五百萬噸，但實際上能够航行大洋的渡洋船舶，各種型式合計約有三·六一〇艘上下，此外每月可加上新造各型船舶約九十萬噸。此龐大的船舶量，是如何被動員着的呢？大致純作戰用二千五百九十萬噸，租軍及其他戰略用二百四十萬噸，用於對外貿易者一百五十萬噸，用於沿岸航綫者二百五十萬噸，合計三千二百三十萬噸。此數須分派於七大洋上，而其配置，殊不平均。尤其在太平洋戰綫上的新作戰中，船舶的分配更不合理。反過來想，船舶殊足限制作戰的規模。</p>
<p>現在且來檢討一下動員於純作戰用的美國船舶噸數，則在前述二千五百萬噸中，用於包含央國本土的西歐戰綫者七百十二萬順左右，而在太平洋全海域動員的船舶，約其二倍，計有一千四百五十萬噸。換言之，即美國所有船舶的二分之一是配置於太平洋的，然而其海陸軍首腦等猶齊聲訴說太平洋戰綫的船舶難。</p>
<p>據美國務副卿格魯在外國新聞協會演說稱，用於硫黃島上陸戰的船舶，比法北上陸作戰所用的噸數更多。太平洋方面，登陸島嶼的士兵，最初一個」月每名必需船舶十六噸，其後每月六噸。美國為給養最初在呂宋島登陸的十萬軍隊，第一個月使用一百六十萬噸的船舶；對於在硫黃島上陸的四萬陸戰隊，最初一個月需船六十四萬噸，其次一個月間，為給養這支陸戰隊，仍非動員二十四萬噸的船舶不可。</p>
<p>大船團行動時，其運用方式可受作戰狀况，作戰海域的地理條件等左右·在各次戰役中·均有頭著的不同。但由奪得制空權制海權而先行完成安排航路的基本工作，差不多可說是常道。為了準備硫黃島上陸作戰，美國空軍曾活動了半年以上。</p>
<p>登陸戰步驟</p>
<p>至於登陸作戰的步驟，大致為：一待上陸軍的集結展開終了，在空軍及艦砲射擊的掩護之下，載着先遣隊的第一船團立即出發，先遣隊抵岸以後，立即造成橋頭堡，接着就有滿載主力的基幹船團隨後跟來。待主力登陸完畢，工兵隊便携帶各種機械器具上陸，迅速在陸上所獲的陣地內建築飛行塲，配以必要的人員和機材。最後便是滿載給養作戰軍資材的補給船國，美軍在這一個階段中，配置極多的船舶。因為集中大量的船舶，所以各船團間的間隔甚小，這是值得注意的特點。</p>
<p>敵船團陳形</p>
<p>在雷伊泰島作戰時，也許是為了長驅出擊緣故，構成先遣隊的第一船團和基幹船團，頗多大型運輪船。及至呂宋作戰時，越明多羅海，蘇祿海北上的船圍中，很多是大型上陸用舟艇軍，而且運第二船團——就是工兵隊所乘的船舶羣——也用此窺舟艇。迨船團抵達仁加因灣口附近，上陸的先鋒部隊便改乘小型舟艇，向陸地疾進。此因自作戰基地到目的地水路距離不大，可用上陸舟艇直接運兵。船團的講成和運用·變化略如上述。</p>
<p>敵美之畏懼</p>
<p>美船團最畏懼的，就是日本一機拼一船的特攻隊拼撞攻擊。他們為對抗起見，一方面在船團中配置相當數目的特設航空母艦，一方面為期減輕大船沉沒時所受的損失，將人員和物資分載較小的船隻一上。美軍的呂宋島作戰，便採取這種辦法。</p>
<p>自從去年以來，美國在造船方面非常努力，急於建造各種軍用特殊船隻。此外，為給養及修理太平洋艦隊起見，特設稱為第十戰隊的補給船團。據其宣傳，該船團裝載「足供三萬七百輛汽率行駛一年所需的汽油，以及供給布里斯本那樣大都市市民吃用一個月的食糧。」美國為了太平洋戰爭新的戰鬥，正在移動集中其船舶，以圖一逞，但日本亦在準備一切，靜待殲敵的時機。如果美國艦船迫近日本，必使之沉入海底。這些沉到海底去的美艦，將成為很好的養魚塲。這可稱之為「羅斯福養魚塲」。（譯自四月二日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>美蘇兩軍會師道爾高　柏林化瓦礫塲巷戰仍烈</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　據此間所獲消息：渴望已久之美蘇兩軍會師，已於昨晚在倫敦，華盛頓，莫斯科同時宜布兩軍係於星期三下午在來比錫東北三十里道爾高（Torgau）地區會師，初由美軍少尉一名及一等兵三名，與蘇軍作初步會面，次日蘇美兩軍指揮官即行會面。史太林昨晚以公在宣布會師之事實，莫斯科以三百二十四尊大砲，各發砲二十四響以作慶祝。同日美總統特魯曼特發表聲明稱，艾森着華麾下反軸心軍，在德國中部預定地點與蘇軍會師，德軍已被截成兩段，但此並非謂歐洲最後勝利之來臨，英美蘇三國國民尚須等待，不但限於歐洲，且在太平洋作最後克服以前，國內戰綫不容一刻鬆懈云。又據倫敦電，邱吉爾及史太林亦曾同時發表聲明。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　海通社訊：二十四小時內柏林之戰仍烈，德婦孺咸參加阻止蘇軍進展之作戰。敵力圖速戰速決未逞，續調後備軍，復出動大隊急降轟炸機，掃射巷戰之德軍及爾堡。蘇方謂已佔柏林三分之二，工業區在內，二十四小時內蘇軍有衛入柏林勞工住區（摩阿比特區）之說。衝入柏林隧道之蘇軍昨進展一哩，仍猛攻未已，柏林城內之戰區大部建築已圯毀，多成瓦際塲。</p>
<p>美軍主力進抵奧境</p>
<p>蘇黎世二十七日中央社電　據前綫消息：美第三軍坦克先鋒部隊，二十六日下午六時突破奧地利亞邊境，與蘇軍間已取得無綫電連裕。同時北方之漢堡與南方之莫尼黑，咸為進襲之月標，英第二軍向漢堡推進，美第七軍距慕尼黑二十五哩。</p>
<h3>義境美軍衝進熱諾亞</h3>
<p>蘇黎世二十八日中央社電　據英方消息：連結奧地利與義大利之勃倫納山隘南面終點之伐洛那（Verona）已被美第五軍佔領，該軍左翼部隊，二十六日衝進熱諾亞港。</p>
<h3>萊諾甘茂林等被釋抵瑞士</h3>
<p>日內瓦二十八日中央社電　據巴黎消息：法國陷落時之首相萊諾，及前首相達拉第·前法軍總司令甘戊林，自法國被佔領以來，即被德人監禁，茲已釋放進人瑞士境內。</p>

<h3>太平洋戰局展望</h3>
<p>— 松島慶三</p>
<p>——在新協滬分會時事報道懇談會講詞</p>
<p>現在太平洋戰爭，主要者在冲繩島一帶進行，今後更將在這一區域展開激烈戰鬥。從四月一日起登陸美軍共有六個師團，其俊所增兵力不多；海上方面從三月廿三日美軍分五支隊進抵冲繩島附近，其機動部隊　遭殲滅性之打擊，已被擊破十之七八，殘部向東逃避，在馬里亞納重新整理。美國空軍同時在九州·四國等地狂施轟炸，企圖毀損日空軍基地，但已數度遭受慘重打擊，實力大減。</p>
<p>冲繩島區陸上現有敵美海軍戰隊兩師團，多在北部半島及伊江島上，然此北部半島之作戰僅可謂「支作戰」，其主要戰綫實在南部，但伊江島形勢險要，頗可注目，故該島之日軍作戰最為勇　。南部戰綫在那聯西方六英里，敵軍已停　該處達兩週之久，迄無寸進。十八日起敵軍曾施猛烈反攻，其目的蓋在壓制此區日方之四個飛機塲。</p>
<p>關於道一帶之戰况詳情，收們可以從敵方將領的談話中測知一般。四月二十日敵美當局曾透露其生產之不順利及補給困難已超過限度。尼米資最近視察冲繩島戰綫後於廿四日對記者談話中亦稱：「該區日軍尚有極强之兵力，美軍現有軍力實不足應付，故極盼歐洲軍隊多多調來。冲繩之防禦工事為日軍根據歷次戰鬥經騐而構成，故極為兀備，即付以最多代價亦難攻下，同時日軍善於運用巧妙戰術，尤以日軍之神風特攻隊使艦船感受最大威脅，對突來之一·二架飛機，責無法防禦。總之，此區日軍之戰術最為精良，尤以重砲之使用，工事之堅固，捨身作戰之精神，更為驚人。</p>
<p>敵美於四月二十六日從前田地區以三千戰事實行進攻，雖被迎頭擊退，但仍有殘留實力存在，在那霸南方之敵亦有進攻企圖。敵方從四月一日起直至最近仍在停頓狀態中，其海軍職力已日漸衰退。二十六日晚在海面觀察所得，現有航空母艦兩艘，輸送船，戰艦各十餘艘。冲繩島與馬利亞納之間所有之特設航空母艦，亦受日軍嚴重打擊。此次冲繩島之戰鬥與塞班島·硫黃島迥然不同，其原因頗多：如　戰區接近日本本土，日軍增援及軍需補充，均極便利；　戰區廣大，可利用地理優點，打擊敵人，　用猛烈拼撞之決死戰術，給敵人以毀滅性打擊；　日方能掌握神機，故現在實為殲滅敵人之最好機會。</p>
<p>在敵美方面從馬里亞納，硫黃島　基地，以B29　P51型飛機，對日本四國九州等區濫施轟炸，但日本軍民必勝信念亳不動搖，且不倦不懈繼續作戰。在這次戰役中，寄與極大期望，不久即可擊潰敵人。同時，敵力雖集中侵犯軍力，而實際上並無任何成就，尤其在補給方面最為困難，即其最著名之第十補給艦隊亦無能為力。</p>
<p>此外，在菲律賓方）面之敵　戰機B24型，其數目約百餘架；大陸方面敵機多在重慶·成都·昆明·長汀等地，其總數共約七百架，敵方空軍之活動範圍：在馬利亞納及硫黃島者多對日木本土；在菲律賓者多對沿中國海岸之船舶；在中團大陸者多對和平區及老河口等前綫。誠然，由以上各基地出發之長距離飛機均可飛達上海，如日前來逼之P51　型及B24型即為自呂宋島起飛者，其目的除破壞交通外，並有時作偵察之用。又B29型之墓地已移馬里亞納，中國之B29型　數量已大為減少。但敵人為實施神經戰略，今後較大規模之轟炸仍極　可能，因此，我們對於防空工作，決不可忽視。</p>
<p>舊金山會議開會之先，美總統特書曼於廿三日下午，曾召集國務卿斯蒂汀留斯，陸軍部長史汀生，海軍部長長佛列斯特，及陸海軍首腦部於白宮舉行軍事將領會議，對於今後太平洋之戰，或將起重要變化，但日本日鈴木大將以下，一億國民必然萬眾一心挺身作戰，完成最後勝利。</p>
<p>在北太平洋戰區曾有小規模戰鬥，四月一日以後雖已解凍，但敵方第九艦隊並無作為，由此可知其實力均已集中冲繩島。其他菲律賓及南太平洋等處敵美軍已受重大損失，力量數薄。</p>
<p>總之今後不論敵方如何宣傳，仍有數點於日本有利：</p>
<p>今後件戰之主要戰區，天時地利均於日方有利；</p>
<p>敵軍在同一地區所能容納之兵力有限，常有自相殘殺之事發生；</p>
<p>各國政治關係，錯綜複雜，相互之間有極大牽制；</p>
<p>日方戰意昂揚，信念堅定，今從敵愾同仇。愈戰愈强。（其昌筆記）</p>

<h3>華中水電公司上海電氣支店</h3>
<p>——本巿公用事業解剖之一</p>
<p>職工待遇</p>
<p>全廠除外籍人不計外，職工共約七百餘人，民國廿七年一月，曾裁汰工友三百人左右，佔總數（原有國人職工一千多人）四分之一，裁員方法第一留職停薪，第二裁汰。最近二三年尚不大批栽員。關於職工待遇，依一般情形而論，工資可分為月薪（工頭），日薪（領班與工人），包工（技術工塲一部份工人）三種·工頭以職員地位看待，凡膳食沐浴塲所等，均與職員在同一地點。且其薪給與一般工人工資相較約高一倍以上。其他待通如每年加薪，慰勞加薪，養老金，撫恤金，年終花紅，例假日期·病假等均有特別之規定。此外自俄職工及外籍職員之待遇亦較本國人為高，並在生活及職業上有種種保陣。自從電力公司軍管理後其職工可申請用電而不受限制，且出費較康，但職工以做二房東為合格，地區亦以住於舊第一區者為限。</p>
<p>用電限度</p>
<p>三十三年一月實行首次電力限制，標準係根據三十二年八·九·十三個月中所用電光·電熱·電力之最高一月之電量，打以折扣。住戶電光打六折，電熱打四折，店戶電光打七折，電熱打四折（燒飯用者打六折），理髪店，菜館，旅館等電光打五五折，工廠依生產品重要與否分別打八折，八五折等不定，此為首次限制住戶店戶工廠用電。又工廠最低為二十五度。</p>
<p>三十三年九月份，住戶，店戶之電光電熱又打對折，常熱除燒飯用之外，其使用不明者完全停止，電光最低限度為十三度。店戶同工廠則打七折，電光最低限度十八度。</p>
<p>三十三年十月份住戶及店戶其限度在四十度以上者，則按照電表之安培再打折扣，三安培一律為二十五度，五安培改為四十度，十安培改為五十度，其不足者照舊。</p>
<p>三十三年十一月份起，工廠及店戶之電力全部停止使用，唯自流并及抽水等特殊塲合，經允許者得例外，又未加限度之電表則完全拆去。</p>
<p>三十四年三月份起住戶·店戶·工廠之電光·電熱限度又打對折，住戶及店戶最低限度為七度，工廠九度，電力因特殊情形而允用者其限度則亦多以日計算。</p>
<p>過去電光·電熱每度一百十究，電力八十元；公司職工用電，電光電熱每度三十三元。最近因燃料等費用增高，該公司曾向當局申請加似，已於四月二十五日蒙核准。其新價電光電熱每度各二百五十元，電力每度二百二十元。公司職工用電，電光電熱每度各七十五元。決定自四月份起照該項新價收費。其超過限度者處置辦法，凡超過議度百分之十者罰二倍，第二百分之十罰五倍，其餘全罰十九倍。例如限度一百度，而使用一百二十五度，則其中超過限度之三十五度則照下法處罰：十度罰二倍，十度罰五倍，十五度罰十九倍。如有二次超過在百分之二十以上者第一次斷電十天，第二次永久斷電。其罰款最多者有藥廠·罐頭廠·紗廠守，最高額一家竟達　　千萬元。</p>
<p>煤斤調電</p>
<p>最近上海電氣支店定有以煤斤調換電力之辨法，凡廠家經介紹皆可申請，其手續為先備申請函一件，書明廠名·所在地·出品·需電量，並隨帶電費單廠家圖書，至南京路一八一號五樓該公司業務科接洽。其原則為每一噸煤可調電三百五十度，初時二噸起調，現已改為五矚起調，此一千七百多度電並限於兩個月內用完，如不需如此之多，亦可聯合數家共同申請，　好表格經審查後再聽候通知，如經梭准，即發送煤單，由敵家憑單將自購之煤逕送囗囗發電廠，即可接綫配電。（完）</p>

<h3>The Japanese Prime Minister's Official Residence Held a Conference the Night Before: Top Leaders of the Army and Navy Agreed to Implement Necessary and Concrete Measures to Deal with the War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: Prime Minister Suzuki, on the 27th, at his official residence, met with Chief of the General Staff Yoshijiro Umezu, Chief of the Naval General Staff Koshiro Oikawa, Minister of the Army Korechika Anami, Minister of the Navy Mitsumasa Yonai, Vice Chief of the General Staff Kyoji Tominaga, Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff Sokichi Takagi, and Vice-Ministers of the Army and Navy, Jiro Shibayama and Teizo Takagi, respectively. The top leaders of the Army and Navy extensively discussed the issue of close cooperation between the Army and Navy and the exertion of combat power. Regarding this matter, Director-General of the Information Bureau Shimomura issued the following statement on the 28th: On the evening of April 27th, a conference of top leaders of the Army and Navy was held at the Prime Minister's official residence to discuss strategies for ensuring victory in the war. In particular, they exchanged various opinions on the integration and exertion of the combat power of the Army and Navy. They also decided to implement necessary and concrete measures to deal with the pressing war situation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: The newly formed Suzuki Cabinet's advisory council held its first meeting at noon on the 28th. At the meeting, Prime Minister Suzuki delivered a speech, hoping that all advisors would cooperate. The advisors then held extensive discussions on the operational guidelines of the advisory council. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Okinawa Airfields and Ships: The Strength of Task Force 58 Weakened</h3>
<p>Southern Ryukyu Islands Base, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Air Force attacked enemy airfields and surrounding enemy ships on Okinawa Island on the afternoon of the 27th, scoring hits on the enemy airfields, causing fires in several locations. They also hit several cruisers with torpedoes. Furthermore, they broke into enemy transport convoys, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Air Special Attack Units in the Ryukyu waters, despite being hindered by the weather, continue to exert their powerful force to the fullest extent, hindering the enemy's invasion attempts. The enemy's mobile forces are now clearly weakened, particularly Task Force 58. This task force initially possessed more than ten battleships and over twenty aircraft carriers, making it a very powerful fleet. The enemy relied on this absolute superiority to rapidly seize Okinawa Island in order to quickly establish strong air bases on land. However, due to the fierce attacks by the entire Japanese Air Force, the enemy's plans have collapsed. According to the Imperial Headquarters' announcement as of the 17th, twelve enemy aircraft carriers have been sunk, two have been sunk or destroyed, and seven have been damaged, totaling twenty-one. In addition, nineteen battleships and many other combat ships have been sunk or damaged. As a result, the offensive power of Task Force 58 has lost more than half of its strength. In particular, only five aircraft carriers remain in the Ryukyu waters. Furthermore, the north-central airfields on Okinawa Island and the Kerama airfields have also had their usability significantly restricted due to Japanese attacks. Therefore, large-scale air attacks by the enemy's Task Force 58 are now completely impossible.</p>
<h3>The Emperor Visits Yasukuni Shrine</h3>
<p>Tokyo, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Emperor visited Yasukuni Shrine on the 28th to personally worship the 41,318 newly enshrined deities, including Marshal-Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, and the heroic spirits who defended the nation. At 8:40 AM this morning, officials from the Army and Navy Ministries, as well as Chief Priest Suzuki and others, were waiting respectfully at the sacred grounds of Kudan. Minister of the Army Anami, Minister of the Navy Yonai, and other related Army and Navy officials were also respectfully waiting in front of the Haiden hall. The Emperor, wearing an Army military uniform, accompanied by Chamberlain Fujita, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, Chief Military Aide-de-Camp Unenuma, and Chief of Imperial Visit Affairs Kato, arrived at Yasukuni Shrine by car at 9:30 AM. Led by the Army and Navy Ministers, he entered the main hall to offer his respects. After the worship, he returned amidst the respectful send-off of the officials.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Strengthens Air Defense Posture</h3>
<p>Tokyo, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: In order to cope with enemy air raids on the city and to boost public morale, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has formulated four key points for neighborhood association air defense teams and instructed all departments within its jurisdiction to comply: (1) To stir up a spirit of courage and resistance; (2) To thoroughly restrict evasion and provide guidance on fire prevention work; (3) To establish excellent storage shelters; (4) To thoroughly implement fire-fighting training.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on Surabaya, Taiwan</h3>
<p>Taipei, April 27th, Central News Agency dispatch: From just past midnight to dawn on the 27th, approximately seven or eight enemy heavy bombers in several waves intruded into the Taipei area, dropped bombs near Tamsui, and then fled.</p>
<p>Jakarta, April 27th, Central News Agency dispatch: Three B-24 type enemy aircraft intruded into the Surabaya area at approximately 9:30 PM on the 24th. They were fiercely attacked by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, and two of them were seen to escape while on fire, and it is largely suspected that they have been shot down. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Difficulties Facing the American Enemy in the Future: Insufficient Shipping is a Fatal Wound</h3>
<p>Recently, Commander of the U.S. Combined Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations Ernest King, during a meeting with a group of journalists, said with a hint of pride: "The United States, in less than four years, has constructed a tree of ships across 3,000 nautical miles in the Atlantic and 7,000 nautical miles in the Pacific (to the Philippines and Marianas). However, the most difficult task lies ahead." Ever since the U.S. Marines landed on Iwo Jima and the revitalized Task Force 58 under Marc Mitscher launched air raids on Japan, American public opinion has been clamoring for an invasion of Japan. Indeed, not long after, Nimitz and even Wedemeyer attended and declared, "For the purpose of discussing new Pacific operations in the future," a war conference of Army and Navy leaders was convened in their home country. During the conference, the strength of King's so-called "tree of ships" was obviously one of the focal points of discussion.</p>
<h3>U.S. Shipping Suffers Shortage</h3>
<p>According to Emory Land's report, at the end of last year, the United States had a total of 5,633 ships, with a total tonnage of approximately 35 million tons. However, the actual number of oceangoing vessels capable of navigating the ocean, in various types, totaled approximately 3,610. In addition, approximately 900,000 tons of newly built ships of various types can be added each month. How is this massive amount of shipping being mobilized? Roughly 25.9 million tons are purely for combat use, 2.4 million tons are rented to the military and for other strategic uses, 1.5 million tons are used for foreign trade, and 2.5 million tons are used for coastal routes, totaling 32.3 million tons. This number must be distributed across the seven oceans, and its allocation is uneven. Especially in the new operations on the Pacific front, the distribution of shipping is even more unreasonable. Conversely, a shortage of ships restricts the scale of operations.</p>
<p>Now, let's examine the tonnage of U.S. ships mobilized for purely combat use. Of the aforementioned 25 million tons, approximately 7.12 million tons are used on the Western European front, including the British mainland, while approximately twice that amount, or 14.5 million tons, is mobilized in the entire Pacific region. In other words, half of all U.S. shipping is deployed in the Pacific. However, even the leaders of the Army and Navy are still lamenting the difficulty of obtaining sufficient shipping on the Pacific front.</p>
<p>According to U.S. Under Secretary of State Grew's speech at the Foreign Press Association, the amount of shipping used for the landing operations on Iwo Jima was greater than the tonnage used for the landing operations in northern France. In the Pacific, each soldier landing on an island requires sixteen tons of shipping for the first month and six tons per month thereafter. In order to supply the initial 100,000 troops landing on Luzon, the United States used 1.6 million tons of shipping in the first month. For the 40,000 Marines landing on Iwo Jima, 640,000 tons of shipping were needed in the first month, and even in the following month, 240,000 tons of shipping had to be mobilized to supply that Marine force.</p>
<p>The way a large convoy is operated can be affected by the operational situation, the geographical conditions of the operational area, and so on. Each battle has its own distinct features. However, it can almost be said to be common practice to first secure air and sea supremacy and complete the basic work of arranging the sea lanes. The U.S. Air Force had been active for more than six months in preparation for the landing operation on Iwo Jima.</p>
<h3>Steps in Landing Operations</h3>
<p>As for the steps in a landing operation, they are roughly as follows: Once the assembly and deployment of the landing troops are completed, the first convoy, carrying the advance party, departs immediately under the cover of air force and naval gunfire. After the advance party reaches the shore, they immediately create a beachhead. Then, the main convoy, fully loaded with the main force, follows. After the main force has landed, the engineering corps lands with various types of machinery and equipment and quickly builds an airfield within the captured positions, staffed with the necessary personnel and equipment. Finally, there are supply convoys fully loaded with provisions and war materials. The U.S. military deploys a very large number of ships in this stage. Because a large number of ships are concentrated, the intervals between each convoy are very small, which is a noteworthy characteristic.</p>
<h3>Enemy Convoy Formations</h3>
<p>During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, perhaps because of the long-range attack, the first convoy, which constituted the advance party, and the main convoy, consisted of many large transport ships. By the time of the Luzon operation, many of the convoys heading north through the Mindoro Sea and Sulu Sea were large landing craft, and even the second convoy—the group of ships carrying the engineering corps—used these landing craft. When the convoy reached the vicinity of the entrance to Lingayen Gulf, the vanguard troops to be landed switched to smaller boats and advanced rapidly towards the land. This was because the distance by water from the operational base to the destination was short, and landing craft could be used to transport troops directly. The composition and operation of convoys change slightly as described above.</p>
<h3>Enemy and U.S. Fears</h3>
<p>What the U.S. convoys fear most is the Japanese special attack force, which sacrifices one plane to sink one ship. In order to counter this, they deploy a considerable number of special-purpose aircraft carriers in the convoy and, in order to reduce the losses suffered when a large ship sinks, distribute personnel and materials among smaller ships. The U.S. military adopted this approach in the Luzon operation.</p>
<p>Since last year, the United States has been working very hard in shipbuilding, rushing to build various special-purpose military vessels. In addition, in order to supply and repair the Pacific Fleet, it has established a supply convoy called the Tenth Fleet. According to their propaganda, this convoy carries "enough gasoline to allow 37,700 cars to drive for a year, and enough food to feed the citizens of a large city like Brisbane for a month." The United States is concentrating and mobilizing its ships in preparation for new battles in the Pacific War, in order to make a show of force, but Japan is also preparing everything and waiting for the opportunity to annihilate the enemy. If American warships approach Japan, they will surely be sunk to the bottom of the sea. These American warships that sink to the bottom of the sea will become excellent fishing grounds. This can be called "Roosevelt's Fishing Ground." (Translated from the April 2nd Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>U.S. and Soviet Armies Meet at Torgau: Battle for Berlin Turns to Rubble and Fierce Street Fighting Continues</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to information obtained here, the long-awaited meeting of the U.S. and Soviet armies was announced simultaneously in London, Washington, and Moscow last night. The two armies met on Wednesday afternoon in the Torgau area, 30 miles northeast of Leipzig. Initially, a U.S. lieutenant and three privates made a preliminary meeting with the Soviet army. The next day, the commanders of the U.S. and Soviet armies met. Stalin announced the fact of the meeting to the public last night, and Moscow celebrated with 324 cannons, each firing 24 rounds. On the same day, U.S. President Truman issued a statement saying that the anti-Axis forces under Eisenhower had met with the Soviet army at a predetermined location in central Germany, and the German army had been cut in two. However, this did not mean that the final victory in Europe had arrived, and the people of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union still had to wait. Not only in Europe, but also in the Pacific, before the final victory, the home front must not relax for a moment. According to a London dispatch, Churchill and Stalin also issued statements simultaneously.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: Reuters reports: The battle for Berlin continues fiercely after 24 hours, with German women and children participating in the fighting to stop the advance of the Soviet army. The enemy's attempt to win a quick victory failed, and they continued to mobilize reserve forces and dispatched large numbers of dive bombers to strafe the German forces in the streets and Erbo [unclear]. The Soviet side said that it had occupied two-thirds of Berlin, including the industrial area. There was a report that the Soviet army had entered the Moabit district, a labor district in Berlin, after 24 hours. The Soviet army, which had rushed into the Berlin tunnel, advanced a mile yesterday and continued to attack fiercely. Most of the buildings in the war zone within Berlin had been destroyed and had become rubble fields.</p>
<h3>Main Force of U.S. Army Advances to Austrian Border</h3>
<p>Zurich, April 27th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to front-line news, the vanguard tank units of the U.S. Third Army broke through the Austrian border at 6:00 PM on the 26th and had established radio contact with the Soviet army. At the same time, Hamburg in the north and Munich in the south were targets of attack. The British Second Army advanced towards Hamburg, and the U.S. Seventh Army was 25 miles from Munich.</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops in Italy Rush into Genoa</h3>
<p>Zurich, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to British news, Verona, the southern end of the Brenner Pass connecting Austria and Italy, has been occupied by the U.S. Fifth Army, and the left wing of that army rushed into the port of Genoa on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Reynaud, Gamelin, and Others Released and Arrive in Switzerland</h3>
<p>Geneva, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to news from Paris, Paul Reynaud, Prime Minister of France at the time of the French surrender, as well as former Prime Minister Édouard Daladier and former French Army Commander-in-Chief Maurice Gamelin, who had been imprisoned by the Germans since the occupation of France, have now been released and have entered Swiss territory.</p>
<h3>Central News Agency Correction</h3>
<p>In the record of the Supreme National Defense Council on the 26th and the order of the National Government regarding the adjustment of the personnel of administrative and military chiefs, the phrase "concurrently the Pacification Director of Kaifeng" was mistakenly issued under the item of special appointment of Bao Wen-yue as Governor of Henan Province. We hereby make a correction.</p>
<h3>Weekly Commentary</h3>
<h3>Prospects for the Pacific War</h3>
<p>— Keizo Matsushima</p>
<p>—— A speech delivered at a news reporting discussion group of the Shanghai branch of the New Association</p>
<p>The current Pacific War is mainly being fought in the Okinawa Island area, and fierce battles will unfold in this region in the future. Since April 1st, the U.S. forces that have landed have totaled six divisions, although the number of reinforcements has not been large. On the sea front, the U.S. forces advanced to the vicinity of Okinawa Island in five task forces from March 23rd, but their mobile task force has suffered devastating blows, with seventy or eighty percent of it being destroyed. The remnants have fled east and are reorganizing in the Marianas. At the same time, the U.S. Air Force has been indiscriminately bombing Kyushu and Shikoku, attempting to destroy Japanese air bases, but has suffered heavy blows several times, and its strength has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>On land in the Okinawa Island area, there are currently two enemy and U.S. Marine brigades, mostly in the northern peninsula and on Ie Island. However, the operations in this northern peninsula can only be called "supporting operations," and the main front is actually in the south. However, the situation on Ie Island is strategically important and noteworthy, so the Japanese forces on that island are fighting very bravely. On the southern front, the enemy has been stopped six miles west of Naha for two weeks without making any progress. Since the 18th, the enemy has launched fierce counterattacks, the purpose of which is to suppress the four Japanese airfields in this area.</p>
<p>We can get a general idea of the details of the fighting around Naha from the statements of enemy generals. On April 20th, the enemy and U.S. authorities revealed that their production was not smooth and that supply difficulties had exceeded the limit. Nimitz also told reporters on the 24th after recently inspecting the Okinawa Island front: "The Japanese forces in that area still have extremely strong forces. The current military strength of the U.S. military is insufficient to cope with it, so we urgently hope that more European troops will be transferred. The defense fortifications on Okinawa are built by the Japanese military based on experience from previous battles, so they are extremely well-prepared. It is difficult to capture them even at the greatest price. At the same time, the Japanese military is good at using clever tactics, especially the Japanese Kamikaze special attack units, which pose the greatest threat to ships. It is impossible to defend against one or two attacking aircraft. In short, the tactics of the Japanese military in this area are the most sophisticated, especially the use of heavy artillery, the solidity of the fortifications, and the spirit of self-sacrifice, which are even more astonishing."</p>
<p>The enemy and U.S. forces launched an attack from the Maeda area with 3,000 troops on April 26th. Although they were repulsed head-on, they still have some residual strength. The enemy south of Naha also has intentions to attack. The enemy has been at a standstill from April 1st until recently, and the strength of their naval personnel has been declining day by day. Observations made on the sea surface on the evening of the 26th revealed that there were currently two aircraft carriers, transport ships, and battleships, each numbering more than ten. All of the special-purpose aircraft carriers between Okinawa Island and the Mariana Islands have also been severely damaged by the Japanese military. The battle on Okinawa Island this time is completely different from Saipan and Iwo Jima for many reasons: (1) The war zone is close to the Japanese mainland, and it is extremely convenient for the Japanese military to provide reinforcements and replenish military supplies. (2) The war zone is vast, and the geographical advantages can be used to strike at the enemy. (3) The desperate tactic of fierce collision is used to inflict devastating blows on the enemy. (4) The Japanese side can grasp opportunities, so now is the best opportunity to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>On the enemy and U.S. side, B-29 and P-51 aircraft have been indiscriminately bombing the Shikoku and Kyushu regions of Japan from bases in the Mariana and Iwo Jima Islands, but the Japanese military and civilians' belief in victory has not wavered in the slightest, and they continue to fight tirelessly. In this campaign, we place great hope and will soon be able to defeat the enemy. At the same time, although the enemy is concentrating its forces to invade, it has actually achieved nothing, especially in terms of logistics, where it faces the greatest difficulties, and even its most famous Tenth Fleet is powerless.</p>
<p>In addition, the enemy on the Philippine front has about a hundred B-24 type combat aircraft. On the mainland front, most of the enemy aircraft are located in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Changting, and other places, totaling about seven hundred. The scope of activity of the enemy air force is: those in the Mariana and Iwo Jima areas mostly target the Japanese mainland; those in the Philippines mostly target ships along the Chinese coast; and those on the mainland of China mostly target peaceful areas and the front line such as Laohekou. Indeed, long-distance aircraft departing from the above bases can all reach Shanghai. For example, the P-51 and B-24 types that have recently approached are those that took off from Luzon. Their purpose is not only to disrupt transportation but also to conduct reconnaissance from time to time. Also, the graveyard of B-29s has been moved to the Marianas, and the number of B-29s in China has been greatly reduced. However, in order to implement a nerve warfare strategy, large-scale bombing is still extremely possible in the future. Therefore, we must not neglect air defense work.</p>
<p>Before the San Francisco Conference was held, U.S. President Truman convened Secretary of State Stettinius, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, and the top leaders of the Army and Navy for a military generals' conference at the White House on the afternoon of the 23rd. There may be important changes in the Pacific War in the future, but the Japanese, led by General Suzuki, and 100 million people will surely stand up as one and fight to complete the final victory.</p>
<p>There have been small-scale battles in the North Pacific war zone. Although it has thawed after April 1st, the enemy's Ninth Fleet has not taken any action, which shows that its strength has been concentrated on Okinawa Island. The enemy and U.S. forces in the Philippines and the South Pacific have suffered significant losses, and their strength is weak.</p>
<p>In short, no matter how the enemy publicizes in the future, there are still several points that are beneficial to Japan:</p>
<p>1.  The main war zone in the future, both in terms of weather and geography, is favorable to Japan.</p>
<p>2.  The number of troops that the enemy can accommodate in the same area is limited, and there are often cases of mutual killing.</p>
<p>3.  The political relations between countries are complex and intertwined, with great restraints on each other.</p>
<p>4.  The Japanese side has high morale and firm beliefs, and is united in its hatred of the enemy. The more we fight, the stronger we become. (Notes by Qichang)</p>

<h3>Minister of Justice Wu Talks About the Overview of Administration</h3>
<p>Nanjing, April 28th, Central News Agency dispatch: Minister of Justice Wu of the Judicial Administration Department met with Chinese and foreign reporters at the department at 3:00 PM on the 28th to report on the recent work of the judicial administration as follows: (1) The department recently revised its organizational law and restored the previous four-department system. (2) The department still adopts a strict approach to the selection of judges. The selection of personnel for all levels of courts must be carefully considered before a decision is made. (3) The high branch court and the high procuratorate, the district court, and the detention center of the department in a certain county have not yet been established because the court site has not yet been decided, and it is feared that it will be difficult to establish them in the short term.

<h3>San Francisco Conference Chairmanship Rotation</h3>

<h3>Molotov's Speech</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th – Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from San Francisco, Soviet representative Molotov delivered a speech to the plenary session on the afternoon of the 26th, stating in essence: The responsibility of this conference lies in laying the foundation for future security for all nations in the world. However, this issue has not been effectively resolved in the past. My opinion is that we should take this opportunity to review the irrationalities of the old League of Nations organization. However, we should not underestimate the various difficulties that our endeavor to build an international security guarantee mechanism will encounter. Indispensable to an international peace organization is the mutual unity of major powers who are consciously aware of their historical mission to safeguard peace and who must exert the strength of this organization, namely Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Chongqing. The representatives of these five nations must cooperate absolutely, and other nations should assist these five major powers. The new international organization must have the strength to maintain general peace, and this organization should also have the military force necessary to maintain peace. If so, the Soviet people will certainly support the establishment of this sound international structure and will be extremely willing to contribute everything.</p>

<h3>Huazhong Hydroelectric Company Shanghai Electrical Branch</h3>
<p>——An Analysis of Public Utilities in this City</p>
<p>Employee Benefits</p>
<p>Excluding foreign nationals, the entire plant employs approximately 700 workers. In January of the Republic Year 27, about 300 workers were laid off, accounting for about one-quarter of the total number (originally over 1,000 domestic employees). The layoff method was firstly, leave of absence with pay, and secondly, layoffs. There haven't been large-scale layoffs in the past two or three years. Regarding employee benefits, generally speaking, wages can be divided into monthly salaries (foremen), daily wages (team leaders and workers), and piecework (a portion of the workers in the technical workshops). Foremen are treated as staff members, and their meals, bathing facilities, etc., are all in the same location as the staff. Moreover, their salaries are about twice as high as those of ordinary workers. Other benefits, such as annual salary increases, consolation salary increases, pensions, bereavement payments, year-end bonuses, holidays, sick leave, etc., have special regulations. In addition, the benefits of Russian employees and foreign staff are also higher than those of domestic employees, and there are various guarantees in life and career. Since the power company was under military management, its employees can apply for electricity without restrictions, and the cost is lower. However, employees are qualified to be second landlords, and the area is limited to residents of the old first district.</p>
<p>Electricity Usage Limits</p>
<p>The first electricity restriction was implemented in January 1944. The standard was based on the highest monthly electricity consumption for lighting, heating, and power in August, September, and October of 1943, with a discount. Residential lighting was discounted by 40%, and heating was discounted by 60%. Commercial lighting was discounted by 30%, and heating was discounted by 60% (those used for cooking were discounted by 40%). Hair salons, restaurants, hotels, etc., were discounted by 45% for lighting. Factories were discounted by 15% or 20%, depending on the importance of the products. This was the first restriction on electricity usage for residents, businesses, and factories. Furthermore, the minimum usage for factories was 25 kilowatt-hours.</p>
<p>In September 1944, electricity for residential and commercial lighting and heating was halved again. Heating, except for cooking, was completely stopped for unclear usage. The minimum limit for lighting was 13 kilowatt-hours. Commercial lighting and factory electricity were discounted by 30%, and the minimum limit for lighting was 18 kilowatt-hours.</p>
<p>From October 1944, for residential and commercial users with limits above 40 kilowatt-hours, the limits were further discounted based on the amperage of the meter. 3 amps were uniformly changed to 25 kilowatt-hours, 5 amps were changed to 40 kilowatt-hours, and 10 amps were changed to 50 kilowatt-hours. Those below the limit remained the same.</p>
<p>From November 1944, the power supply for factories and shops was completely stopped, except for special cases such as artesian wells and water pumping, which were allowed with permission, and meters without limits were completely removed.</p>
<p>From March 1945, the limits on electricity for lighting and heating for residential, commercial, and factory users were halved again. The minimum limit for residential and commercial users was 7 kilowatt-hours, and for factories, it was 9 kilowatt-hours. The limit for power supply allowed for special circumstances was mostly calculated on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In the past, the price of electricity was 110 yuan per kilowatt-hour for lighting and heating and 80 yuan for power. The price of electricity for company employees was 33 yuan per kilowatt-hour for lighting and heating. Recently, due to the increase in fuel and other costs, the company applied to the authorities for a price increase and was approved on April 25th. The new prices are 250 yuan per kilowatt-hour for lighting and heating and 220 yuan per kilowatt-hour for power. The price of electricity for company employees is 75 yuan per kilowatt-hour for lighting and heating. The new prices are effective from April. The method for dealing with exceeding the limits is as follows: a penalty of twice the price for exceeding the limit by 10%, a penalty of five times the price for the second 10%, and a penalty of 19 times the price for the rest. For example, if the limit is 100 kilowatt-hours and the usage is 125 kilowatt-hours, the 25 kilowatt-hours exceeding the limit will be penalized as follows: 10 kilowatt-hours will be penalized at twice the price, 10 kilowatt-hours will be penalized at five times the price, and 5 kilowatt-hours will be penalized at 19 times the price. If the limit is exceeded by more than 20% twice, the electricity will be cut off for 10 days for the first offense and permanently for the second offense. The highest fines are paid by pharmaceutical factories, canning factories, and yarn factories, with one factory reaching tens of millions of yuan.</p>
<p>Coal for Electricity Exchange</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Electrical Branch has established a method for exchanging coal for electricity. Any factory can apply through an introduction. The procedure is to first prepare an application letter stating the factory name, location, products, and electricity requirements, and bring the electricity bill and factory seal to the company's business department on the 5th floor of 181 Nanjing Road for negotiation. The principle is that each ton of coal can be exchanged for 350 kilowatt-hours of electricity. Initially, the minimum exchange was two tons, but now it has been changed to five tons. These 1,700 kilowatt-hours of electricity must be used up within two months. If that much electricity is not needed, several factories can apply together. After the form is reviewed, wait for notification. If approved, a coal voucher will be issued, and the enemy factory can send the purchased coal directly to the power plant to connect the line for electricity distribution. (End)</p>

It is understood that the reason for the fare adjustment of trams and buses is to balance income and expenditure due to the current increase in general expenses. In addition, the company has also planned to restore the full-day operation of vehicles as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. This can be realized once the electricity problem is resolved.</p>

<h3>Measures to Crack Down on the Gold Black Market Under Study</h3>
<p>The sharp and rapid rise in gold prices in this city in the past two weeks has stimulated the prosperity of government bonds and stocks related to finance, creating a chaotic situation. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has specially appointed Zhang Guiru, Zhang Zhonghuan, and Li Ji from the Central Reserve Bank's Financial Inspection Office to jointly investigate the trading accounts of brokers at the Shanghai Chinese Business Securities Exchange and inspect the lending business of various financial institutions to see if there is any exploitation of depositors' funds to engage in gold speculation. The investigation and inspection work has been largely completed and will be reported to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. It is understood that measures to crack down on the gold black market are currently being studied and formulated by relevant economic authorities. There should be a standard limit for the rise and fall of market prices. Because the market conditions have fluctuated severely in the past, with prices rising and falling sharply, the difference is huge, and the risk of overturning assets is very high, which indirectly affects the stability of the entire finance and stimulates the rise of general commodities, and is also closely related to social people's livelihood and security.</p>
<h3>Jiang Shiyan Case to Open for Trial on the Fourth of Next Month</h3>

<h3>Strengthening Control Work of the Materials Review Council: Adjustments to Organizations and Personnel of Various Control Associations</h3>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Chairman of the Materials Control Review Committee, and Chen Junhui, Secretary, deemed the wartime control of materials for national use and civilian needs increasingly important. In addition to vigorously promoting the operation of various materials control businesses under the Trade Control Association, they are actively pushing forward with reforms, and have decided that the Shanghai office will be permitted to convene a liaison meeting of various control associations every two weeks, as convenient, in order to expedite and smooth out material reviews. Therefore, thorough adjustments to the organizations and personnel of various control associations are not only specifically aimed at strengthening the business and affairs of the control organs, but also are definitely deeply related to the fulfillment of the predetermined goals of material exchange between the provinces and cities of Central China. The movement of all materials has recently been very smooth, and the complex problems in transportation are also being considered for overcoming steps, and it is expected that they will be gradually resolved in the near future. It is heard that Chen Shilong's recent visit to Shanghai is highly related to material control and material production matters.</p>

<h3>Changeover Ceremony for New and Old Deputy Directors of the Police Bureau Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Deputy Director Du Delivered Instructions on Behalf of Concurrently Serving Director Zhou</p>
<p>Lu Ying, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, was ordered to be transferred to the National Government as a Senior Aide-de-Camp. The vacancy will be filled by Man Qiwei, Chief of the First Division of the Municipal Government, who will serve as acting Deputy Director and concurrently hold the position of Chief of the First Division. The changeover ceremony was held in the hall on the eighth floor of the bureau yesterday morning (the 28th). Concurrently Serving Director Zhou was in Nanjing on official business and specially appointed Deputy Director Bo Zhengjian to preside over the ceremony. The new and outgoing Deputy Directors Lu and Man, as well as the chiefs of all divisions and sections, and the chiefs of all branch bureaus, along with other high-ranking police officers, were present.</p>
<p>Instructions from Concurrently Serving Director Zhou</p>
<p>First, Deputy Director Du delivered instructions on behalf of Concurrently Serving Director Zhou, stating: "This time, Deputy Director Lu has been honored with an important position in the central government, and Acting Deputy Director Man has taken office. I feel deeply moved. Deputy Director Lu has a long history in the police force, originally serving as the director in the city center. After the return of the concessions, he served as the second director. After the merger, he began serving as the deputy director of this bureau. His contributions to the police force are truly great. Acting Deputy Director Man originally served as the chief of the Anhui Provincial Police Department and is currently the chief of the First Division of this bureau. During his tenure, he fully demonstrated his agile skills in refreshing police administration and improving benefits. This is well known to everyone. In the future, as acting Deputy Director, he will surely make even greater contributions. I hope everyone will provide more assistance to strengthen the police force."</p>
<p>Speech by Deputy Director Lu</p>
<p>Next, Deputy Director Lu delivered a speech, stating: "I am very grateful for the assistance I have received from everyone during my tenure. The purpose of my service in the bureau has always been to 'care for the people and reduce their suffering. Even if I do not have the power to reduce the people's difficulties, I must absolutely not cause the people to increase their suffering.' Acting Deputy Director Man and I are old colleagues, and his past achievements are commendable. I hope that everyone will help Acting Deputy Director Man to work hard on police affairs and ensure local security."</p>
<p>Speech by Deputy Director Man</p>
<p>Finally, Acting Deputy Director Man delivered an inaugural speech, stating: "Deputy Director Lu of this bureau has been honorably promoted to an important position as Senior Aide-de-Camp in the central government. The municipal government has appointed me to fill the vacancy, while also temporarily serving as the Chief of the First Division. Upon receiving this order, I deeply feel that my abilities are insufficient for this important responsibility. As I begin my tenure, I would like to report my intentions as follows: My work will center on strictly adhering to the police administration reform plan and various central government laws and regulations announced by Mayor and Director Zhou, with a fearless and selfless spirit, and a determination not to stop until the goal is achieved. I will work tirelessly, regardless of praise or criticism, and work together with my colleagues under the leadership of Concurrently Serving Director to complete the police administration reform plan. At the same time, I will do my best to ensure the peace and well-being of the citizens of Shanghai and enhance their welfare. Furthermore, I will work with my colleagues to pay attention to correcting police discipline, rectifying police service, and strengthening police education, in order to promote a model police force and fulfill the heavenly duty of being faithful public servants to the people. I hope that my colleagues will 'unite sincerely.' Shanghai is an important area for military, political, cultural, and economic affairs. Because it has a long historical environment and unique characteristics, all of my colleagues must, regardless of nationality or region, work with a spirit of Sino-Japanese co-existence and death, and make courageous and diligent efforts so that all measures of Shanghai's police administration can conform to the central system and achieve our work requirements."</p>
<p>Welcome to Deputy Director Man</p>
<p>Man Qiwei, the appointed acting Deputy Director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, officially took office yesterday. Su Chengde, Director of the Anti-Opium Affairs Bureau, and senior police officers above the rank of Section Chief from various branches of the Police Bureau, in order to show their solidarity on the same hard-working front line, to express their cooperation and spirit of hard work, and to express their welcome, specially held a welcome tea party at 540 Huashan Road at 6:00 PM yesterday. Secretary-General Luo was also invited to attend. Director Su delivered a welcome speech, followed by instructions from Secretary-General Luo, and finally a thank-you speech from Deputy Director Man. The atmosphere was very harmonious, and the party ended around 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Stationery and Instrument Industry Association Generously Donates One Hundred Dozen Pencils to Charity School</h3>
<p>In addition to a portion of the stationery used by students at the newspaper's charity school being printed and donated by this newspaper, there is still a shortage of pencils, medium-sized calligraphy brushes, and other items for middle and high grades. A letter was sent to the Stationery and Instrument Industry Association of this city to solicit donations in order to maximize the effect. We have received a reply letter and a generous donation of one hundred dozen pencils. The association's enthusiasm for education is admirable. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Your association's solicitation of pencils, medium-sized calligraphy brushes, and other stationery for charity elementary schools demonstrates a deep respect for charity education. Our association will do our best to make a sincere donation. Of these items, the medium-sized calligraphy brushes are not products of our association's members and cannot be collected. For pencils, we have solicited one hundred dozen from members Shanghai Pencil Factory and Weicheng Pencil Factory, which will be donated. We are sending them in full as requested and hope you will accept them."</p>
<p>Gratitude for Donation</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. Xu Meihua stated: "I lost my wallet a few days ago and it was picked up by Mr. Chen Peiliang of Wufeng Company, who kindly returned it to me. I originally intended to send a thank-you gift of 5,000 yuan, but Mr. Chen firmly refused. Therefore, I am sending the money to your newspaper to be used as a 'charity school fund' for Mr. Chen's benefit. I hope you will accept it."</p>
<p>Continued Receipt of Textbooks</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received old textbooks from the Ji Xiao School, including 28 books donated by Mr. Hu Guocheng and 43 books jointly donated by Qu Haiqin from Class A of the Fifth Grade and Yin Jinfu from Class B of the Sixth Grade of Ren Zhi Elementary School. Thank you.</p>
<p>Brief News</p>
<p>Donation to Old People's Home: A letter from Mr. Yao Qingshou stated: "My wet nurse, Ms. Xu, is from the Shuanglin Township. Her family was originally poor, and after the war, the family was scattered and became homeless, reduced to beggars. Last autumn, someone from the hometown spoke of this matter, and I learned the details. I entrusted him to return to the hometown to search for her, and planned to provide a small monthly allowance. Unexpectedly, after many months, there was no news. Yesterday, I suddenly received confirmation that she had died last summer, wandering aimlessly and filling a ditch. I have been saddened for a long time. I originally planned to provide a small contribution for funeral expenses, but I cannot do so because there is no way to send it. Because I think that there are many people in the world in similar situations, if they can be rescued early and sheltered, they will not end up like this. Therefore, I am sending 5,000 yuan in national currency, please donate it to the old people's home to use as expenses and as a memorial."</p>
<p>Charity Concert by Ms. Bai Guang: The Shanghai Music Association-sponsored concert by Ms. Bai Guang is scheduled to take place at 2:30 PM on May 5th at the Lyceum Theatre, accompanied by a symphony orchestra, with a very exciting program.

This office also has tickets for sale. It is hoped that enthusiastic members of society will actively participate and support this charity event.</p>
<p>In order to complete tuberculosis prevention and achieve public health, the association plans to immediately provide free air needle treatments. Residents of this city who have been found to have lung disease through X-ray examination can apply to the association. Detailed methods will be announced soon.</p>
<p>National Studies Lecture Series at the Literary Research Institute: The Shanghai Chinese Literary Research Institute, in order to increase interest in the study of national studies, has established a National Studies Lecture Series. The manuscripts are currently being compiled and will soon be printed. Anyone interested in national studies can send a self-addressed stamped envelope to request them.</p>
