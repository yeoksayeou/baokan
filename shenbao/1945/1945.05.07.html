<h3>日應付歐洲急變情勢　保留自由行動權　東鄕外相宣稱德違反協定</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日東鄕外相六日午前十一時，於外相官邸曾見新聞記者，對記者所詢「關於德國內軍總司令官希姆莢對英·美媾和，杜尼資元帥對蘇聲明繼續抗戰等，想當影鑾於日本帝國對德外交，大臣所見如何」一點答覆如下：希姆萊國內軍總司令官對英·美乞降及杜尼資就任廣播，明示德國意圖所在，即爲對蘇戰爭，對英·美方針則爲乞和，此與帝國對蘇聯保持中立關係，對英·美作戰之目的，不僅逈異，且對於三國間單獨不媾和協定，甚爲違反，故俟事態確認後，帝國對於三國協定及其他日·德間諸政治之措置，當保留立於新觀點而行動之自由，與夫對歐洲情勢之急變，帝國政府態度業已顯明，茲誌談話如次</p>
<p>關於最近德國情勢之情報，多係敵方所供給，故帶有宣傳色彩，且有矛盾之處，希姆萊國內軍總司令官對英·美乞降及杜尼資元帥就任之際，作「告國民」之廣播中，强調對蘇繼續戰爭，對英·美則以不妨害德對蘇作戰，即予停戰一事，各情報大致相同，如德方熊度果屬如是，則其意圖所在，以對蘇戰爭爲主，對英·美當乞和是也。因此與日本帝國之對蘇聯保持中立關係，而邁進於對英·美戰爭之目的迪異，旦對於希特勒元首逝世後之德國難以認有採取適合三國協定，共同完遂戰爭之行動，故俟事熊確認後，帝國對於三國協定及其他日·德間之諸政治措　，當具有立於新觀點，而得自由行動之權，不論德之態度如何，日本遂行對英·美戰爭決意當絲毫不爲所動，已於鈴木總理談話中闡明矣。</p>
<h3>沖繩周圍敵艦船擊沉毀四十餘艘日大本營發表猛攻戰果</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日大本營六日下午五時三十分發表：　日空軍部隊繼續攻擊沖縄本島敵空軍基地及本島爲圍敵艦船興機動部隊，自五月三日以來，繼續猛攻，予敵莫大損害，自五月三日起，戰至現在止，日方判明之戰果如次：擊沉特設航空母艦一艘，戰艦三艘，巡洋艦一艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦四艘，驅逐艦一艘，掃海艇一艘，艦型不詳者四艘（其中一艘爲大型艦），輸送船一艘。擊毀特設航空母艦三艘，巡洋艦一艘，驅遂艦一艘，輸送船一艘，中彈起火船隻計二十餘艘。　參加本次攻擊之航空部隊，多係特別攻擊隊。　日潛水艦五月一日夜迄二日晟之間，攻擊沖繩本島南方海面北上中之敵補給部隊，計沉擊其大型輸送船一艘，驅逐艦二艘及艦型不明者二艘。</p>
<p>松島部長發表談話</p>
<p>中央社訊五月六日大本營發表冲縄方面日軍復又擊沉敵艦船二十七艘，日軍對該方面作戰所獲綜合戰果，共巳擊沉擊毀敵艦艇四百九十八艘。日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐特對此發表談話，斷定敵海上兵力已蒙受潰減打擊，日軍已完全把握作戰之主動權。更就敵方窘狀關述如後；南西諸島折海敵機動部隊，已蒙重大打擊，不能活動，日航空部隊及潜永艦部隊更痛擊冲繩週邊策應陸上作戰中之敵艦船部隊，予以損害。冲繩島上敵軍，數日來，遭遇日睦軍之猛烈反擊，是故在北部戰綫之美陸軍第七十七師及海軍第一師調赴南部救援。首里市前面之美第九十六師，並於數日前敵即宣稱已迫近首里市八百碼，然於五日之敵方戰况公報中，則稱美軍前棧現在距該市二千六頁碼地點承認後退。更根據敵方報道，傳日軍四日夜，乘舟艇於冲繩島敵軍之背登陸，惹起美軍後方大混亂云云。如是則冲縄方面敵軍海陸空三方面，均受日軍壓迫，陷於非常苦境，敵海上交通即將斷絕，救援乏術，島上十萬美軍即將瀨於完全潰減之境，此足證歐局情勢絕不影饗日軍作戰，不但如此，日軍益以强大之力量，邁進於擊減英美兵力</p>
<h3>杜尼資單獨行動日決意不受影響</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　關於希特勒元首陣亡後之德國現狀，綜合歐洲各方情戰，一致傳稱德國現與日·德·義三國共同敵人英·美進行和平交涉，而對與日本維持中立關係之蘇聯，則始終繼續抗戰。日東鄉外相於六日會見記者團，闡明日本對歐洲急愛情勢之獨自立塲，說明確國此項新事態，實係達反大東亞開戰後日·德·義三國所締結之單獨不媾和協定。此項消息如予證實，則日本今後決立於新觀點，而得到行動之自由。同時並稱，德國雖失却共同戰爭力，亦與日本政府完遂大東亞防衛戰爭之決意毫無影響。按日·據·義三國單獨不媾和條約，係於大東亞戰爭勃發未久之一九四一年十二月十一日在柏林簽訂，該協定第一條規定，日·德·義三國對於英·所强迫之戰爭，應以其所有一切强方手段，予以遂行，直至勝利爲止。第二條約定日·德·義三國在未經互相完全諒解之前，對於英·美之無論任何一方，槪不休戰或媾和。又第三條規定，三國於戰爭完成後，亦須密切協力，以樹立一九四〇年九月二十七日三國條約所規定之公正新秩序，綜上而觀，可知上項協定不獨約定不單獨媾和，且對於戰後協力建設東亞並歐洲之新秩序，亦加以誓約。然據歐洲情勢，傳德國國社黨中樞領袖兼國內軍總司令官及內政部長，掌握全國警察權，而爲希特勒元首逝世後國內最有力量之希姆萊，向英·美建議無條件投降。該項情報，不獨爲英·美官方承認，且連中立國瑞典外交部亦予以確認。又杜尼資於就任元首對國民發表廣播演說之際曾　：「余之第一任務，乃由布爾希維克之破壞中拯救德國國民，爲達到此項目的起見，唯有繼續作戰。英·美兩國如妨害吾人完成此項目的，則吾人對英·美亦當繼續作戰」。對英·美之繼續抗戰，以英·美軍妨害對蘇戰爭時始予實行之一點，已有明確之表示。杜尼資之此項聲明，與日本擊碎英·美以獲致大東亞自存自衛之戰爭目的，全屬違反。又對於爲維持東亞安寗，而希望與蘇聯維持中立關係之日本對蘇政策，亦不合致。由此可知杜尼資政府實已完全拋棄與日本提携完遂對英·美共同戰爭之意圖，關於杜尼資之此項聲明，有左列事實可資左證：</p>
<p>一，德軍需部長史比亞於三日廣播演說，要求國民與敵英·美積極協力，渠稱，鐵道組織儘速恢復，於英·美許可或命令時，應盡全力瑜送食　至飢餓威脅地域。</p>
<p>一，杜尼資指揮下之德國西北部丹麥·荷蘭德軍，已相繼要求投降。</p>
<p>一，德抗戰據點之普拉格，基爾等已宣布爲不設防城市，尤以基爾爲海軍軍港，在杜尼資之直接指揮下，</p>
<p>一。傳挪威駐軍代表亦已向英·美要求無條件投降。</p>
<p>綜上而觀，可知自希特勒逝世後之德國國內，已日趨崩潰，過程極爲明瞭，是以日本必須採取獨自政策，以應付急變之情勢。</p>
<p>島上日軍展開攻擊</p>
<p>南西羣島六日中央社電　仲繩本島敵軍，曾數次發動總攻擊，每次均因日守軍勇敢奮戰而告頓挫，但敵軍仍準備次期攻勢。日陸上部隊爲呼應特攻隊及航空部隊，自三日以來，對敵機動都隊展開大攻勢，爲於四日晨開始大攻擊，敵第一綫陣地早已發生動搖，日軍之進攻，極爲順利。</p>
<p>南西諸島基地六日中央社電　五日午后迄至夜間，日航空部隊數資攻擊本島機場，北飛機塲數處發生大火，並突入敵艦船羣，對巡洋艦二艘，驅遂艦一艘施行果敢之魚雷攻擊。又五日來襲列島綫機數約四百架左右。</p>
<h3>日海空攻擊隊收獲綜合戰果沉毀艦船總計四九八艘</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　三月二十三日敵在冲縄作戰開始以來，日海空攻擊隊所收獲之綜合戰果，根據大本營發表，擊沉擊毀敵艦船累計已達四百九十八艘之驚人數字，內容如次：</p>
<p>航母　擊沉十二艘，擊毀十一艘，擊沉或擊毀二艘。</p>
<p>戰艦擊沉十三艘，擊毀十三艘，繋沉或聲毀一艘。</p>
<p>戰艦或巡洋艦擊沉四艘，擊毀十五艘，擊沉或擊毀一艘。</p>
<p>戰艦或輸送船擊沉一艘</p>
<p>大型艦擊沉九艘，擊毀十三艘，擊沉或擊毀五</p>
<p>巡洋艦擊沉四十四艘，擊毀二十二艘。</p>
<p>巡洋艦或驅逐艦擊沉十艘，擊毀二艘，</p>
<p>巡洋艦或輸送船擊沉一般，擊毀一艘。</p>
<p>驅逐艦擊沉三十八艘，擊毀二十五艘。</p>
<p>輸送船擊沉三十四艘，擊毀三十四艘。</p>
<p>油積船或航母擊毀一艘</p>
<p>上陸用輸送船擊沉十六艘。</p>
<p>油槽船擊沉一艘。</p>
<p>艦型不明擊沉八十五艘　，擊毀七十四艘。</p>
<p>掃海艇擊沉五艘，擊毀二艘</p>
<p>魚雷艇擊毀二艘。</p>
<p>計擊沉二百七十四艘，擊毀二百十五艘，擊沉或擊毀九艘。</p>
<p>總計　四百九十八艘</p>
<h3>山崎昇任滿鐵總裁</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　滿鐵總裁小日山直登就任運通相後，由副總裁山崎元幹昇任總裁。</p>
<h3>大東亞周間戰況</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　大東亞各地周間戰况如次；</p>
<p>沖繩方面</p>
<p>二十六日以來，日軍於陣前擊破敵軍連續攻擊，更自各方面實施強烈之反擊作戰，日特攻隊，航空部隊亦呼應地上部隊反擊作戰，對本島週邊之敵艦船羣及敵基地加以痛擊，敵陣營因以混亂，而敵艦船羣之艦砲射擊及轟擊亦漸次減少。本周敵機動部隊沿奄美大島至先島翠島之列島綫繼續砲轟，現活動已趨消極，敵集結之艦隊空軍大半已被擊沉擊毀，敵爲補救頹勢，積極從事擴充慶良間列島，神山島，伊江島，本鳥北中兩機塲，急欲及早以基地空軍之傘覆滅沖繩，但遭日機實行夜間空襲，連夜炸毀敵資材燃料用品，使之起火，因此，敵航空基地前淮作戰苦惱色彩日濃，尚企圖由加爾各答方面增强接濟，然該方面敵巨型機翼約六百架左右，本周戰術</p>
<p>菲島海域</p>
<p>本周敵强力推萬作戰，以峨名羅爲目標，於各地日夜展開激戰。</p>
<p>南西太平洋</p>
<p>二十七日敵船團出擊泰拉千方面，三十日夜間至一日晨，敵部隊在林卡斯登陸，各處展開激戰。又對峇厘巴板，賽萊比斯資源地帶，仍執　空襲。</p>
<p>緬甸方面</p>
<p>曼達萊，仰光之間地區，敵機甲部隊逐次南下，四月二十八日在阿朗妙與伊洛瓦底右岸之敵，同時侵愛那羣。又南部緬甸五月一日敵於仰光附近降落空挻部隊，同時以艦挻部隊侵入仰光河口，似在開始登陸作戰。</p>
<p>印度洋方面</p>
<p>三十日晨，卡尼科巴出現包括空母之英機動部隊，下午一部來襲玻特波萊阿方面，砲擊陸上，越一日敵機動部隊再度來襲卡尼科巴，以砲轟擊陸上。三日晝間驅逐艦數艘東襲達伊庫庫。</p>
<p>中國方面</p>
<p>老河口方面日軍部隊，確保附近要綫，擊毀當面第一，第五戰區之敵軍中，又以一部對南陽南方五十公里之新野周過地區之第五十五軍主力，實施擊滅中，四月十四日日軍部隊由粵漢綫西方寧鄕·永豐·實慶·東安開始行動，敵十三，七十四各軍計七個師團，實施擊破戰，目下正對憑持雪峯山峻險頑強抵抗之軍隊加以猛攻中。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>安定人心之道</h3>
<p>近來以歐洲局勢的急遽轉變，影饗所及，東亞各地民眾心理，不無稍受刺激，但是爲着爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利，無論是政府當局或是社會領袖，都應盡力誘使民眾感情，趨於鎭靜。因爲凡是臨事慌亂燥急從事者，結果難免失敗；惟有於鎭靜中，始能正確判斷事態發展之動向，而籌劃適當對策。所以，我們處於今日的環境，更希望朝野人士，一致以冷靜的頭腦，觀察瞬變的時局。換言之，當時局急趨急迫緊張之時，人心愈表現安定鎮靜。人心安定的表現，可以從政府與民間兩方面反映。同時，也惟有政府與民間共同協力，才能使人心趨於安定。在政府方面，我們主張必須强化地位，進而推行强力政治。消極方面，當然是以制止流會及投機，消除一切足以惑亂人心的基因。最近德義戰局的急轉，上海及各地人心未如一般預想之波動，是由於黨局最近努力制裁流言投機的結果；同時，隨時以時局真相正確報道，使投機份子及敵方謀略宣傳無法利用，不能以不盡不實的消息煽惑人心。這是最近政府方面對於安定人心措置的進步。</p>
<p>積極方面，主要的是政府地位的强化，做成强有力的政府，只有推行强大政治，才能表現政府對於國事和民眾安寗有切實把握，而且確實有能力負實，則任何敵方的謀略，也無所肆其技，而人心自能安定。爲着達到這一步，政府必須提高本身在政治上的威信，切實保障人民的一切合法權利，並進而改善人民的生活，如穩定幣值，抑制物價，公平配給等，而更要緊的先耍更進一步努力推進生產建設事業。</p>
<p>在人民方面，只要政府能做到上述兩點，我們相信，不僅人心不會受任何外來的刺激而表示動搖，並且一定會起而自動協力。最近國際局勢之變化，各地人心未有若何重大波動，誠如本月四日大陸新報社評所指出，也就是因爲政府相當地做到上述兩點。但是，安定人心，人民和政府必須同樣負責，我們固然希望政府能够先辦到上述兩點，同時民間也必須表現對政府的信任，和對政府政策的協力。例如近來政府倡辦的蘇滬公路建設，農村貸款等等，都足以表現政府有辦法，而且有決心和實力去辦；我們民眾就也應該盡力協助，周時有若干生產建設事業，凡是民間的有力者，不必等待政府發動而自動興辦，例如最近浙紳發起興修浙江海塘工程，便是最好的榜樣。</p>
<p>總之，在時局動盪之際，人心固然需要安定。而怎樣使人心安定，尤需耍政府與民國一面自强一面協力，因此，在此種需要之下，決不容有只知自私自利，而不顧公益公利者的存在，也不容隔岸觀火逃避責任者的處身事外。惟有積極的共同負起責任，以不斷的努力適應時局的變化，才是根本的安定人心之道。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>歐洲情勢與中國民心</h3>
<p>在國府統治下，依然殘存着政治上的騎將主義者。而在上海及其他商業中心地，醉心投機者亦復不少，他們竟以祖國的不幸作爲　取暴利的手段。由這些分子釀成的空氣，在遂行戰爭上，實有令人不勝寒心者。然而，此種惡風，最近有漸漸矯正之勢，道是值得注意的。以柏林陷落，希時勒陣亡等歐洲情勢的迅速轉變爲背景，一部分人士曾憂慮上海及其他地方的民心將發生動搖不安，但實際上不僅還種憂慮現已消弭，而且一般的傾向恰與意料相反，此在友邦中國，實屬非常可喜的事。</p>
<p>柏林陷落及其他消息傳來時，上海市塲頗爲冷靜，恰與預料相反，預料行將暴騰的烚赤，關金券，公債及食糧等的價格，都繼績維持原狀。常然有賴於當局的努力取締，但主要的是反映中國民心的安定，以致驗牆分子投機分子的技倆亦無從　逞了。或許有人說，歡洲的情勢曰上月中旬以來即已成爲地方事件，所以現在不再發生更大的彼動，但將今日的市塲情况和上月十五日以後的情形比較，則此說之殊欠妥富，可毋待論證了。</p>
<p>第二件值得注目的事實，即所謂五十億元農村貸款，小工廠的疏散工作等，在現階段中主張特別有分，且正移諸實踐，此可究全打消騎牆主義者的蠢動。此種長期永續的建設工作之移諸實踐，可視爲民衆表示對於情勢的變化已不懷任何憂慮，而願繼續協力遂行戰爭的意　。尤其如五十億元農村貸款，完全由民間發動，並得全上海市民的協力，我們於此尤可發見其重大的意義。</p>
<p>各地的民心，過去幾乎一直是安定的，僅有時不免反映上海的動態而有若干變化，而今日，誘發此種變化的原因，正在消弭中。因此，安定之可永續不渝，殆無疑義。所謂戰時下的心理建設，今日已逐漸具備進入積極階段的條件了。</p>
<p>關於中國民心的安定，我們向有樂觀的傾向，今以歐洲情勢的變化爲背景，業已證實了。中國的民心，其本身原望安定，惟因各種搗亂者存在之故，以致未能顯示其本來面目。而今日，搗亂工作終將歸於失敗。我們必須趁此機會展開思想攻勢，以圖戰時心理建設的完成。由徽處搗亂者的消極方策進向思想攻勢，振作輿論工作的展開，乃是中日指導者當前的重大課題。（五月四日大陸新報社論）</p>

<h3>舊金山會議波蘭阿根廷參加問題莫洛托夫演說全文</h3>
<p>此次舊金山會譏中，科紛百出，最值得注目者，爲　蘇聯對抗英美，及　小國反抗大國支配爾爭執。以前者言，表現而爲　表決票數問題，　波蘭阿根廷參加問題；　蘇聯三票要求問題。關於波關阿根廷參加問題，本報茲選譯蘇外長莫洛托夫於四月三十日全體會議席上之演說，以供參考。</p>
<p>按蘇聯對歐外交政策，目前在於樹立其周圍之親蘇政權；在舊金山會議中提議邀請波蘭參加，即此政策之具體表現。唯此提案，卒以英美反對，於三十日全體會中被否決。－編者－</p>
<p>主席！諸位先生！</p>
<p>蘇聯代表團認爲阿根廷問題，即邀請阿根廷出席本會問題，是一個非普通的問題。關於道個問題，我耍用並非大家全體能懂的俄國話來說幾句。然而我知道，俄國語誓討論公正的問題是很恰當的，並且我希望我所說的，大家都會明白，也都會相信。邀請阿根廷出席本會的問題，只是今天才突乎其來地在代表團間提出來。過去一直到現在，在四邀睛國的代表間半字也示曾討論過這一問題，所以很客易知道，蘇聯代表團本身希望先瞭解這一問題，同時也希望對整個參加本會義的代表們，給以瞭解這一問題的機會，因此蘇聯代表國提議將此問題的檢討，延長數日。</p>
<p>無人不知無人不曉，阿根廷在此次反對我們共同敵人的戰爭當中，曾採取特別的立塲。在這一點上大家都曉得，當此次戰爭期間，決不老是阿根廷的外交政策不受其他聯合國的贊成，而且阿根廷的內政，也總是受其他聯合國反對的。爲了證明我的話，暫且引證一直美國前任國務卿赫爾先生的聲明。這是一九四四年九月八日公佈的，內容說：「昨日國務卿赫爾曾痛詆阿根廷爲本半球的法西斯運動大本營，亦爲其他美洲國家窮兇極惡的逋逃藪」。</p>
<p>我再引證一個一般人所最擁護的聲明。這是一九四四年十月一日美國羅斯福大總統說的，即：「我非常注視著近幾月來阿根廷事變的發展。情形極端矛盾，即正當壓迫和侵略的勢力在歐洲以及其他世界各處，都在日益接近澈底失敗的時間，反來我們這半球的這個國家，在發展納粹及法西斯的影響，並且也在擴大採用納粹及法西斯的方法」。</p>
<p>我認爲這兩個聲明決非無的放矢，而是千真萬確的事實。然而言猶在耳，時間尚不過數月，難道說阿根廷的形勢就從那時起，立刻發生了根本變化不成？我聽到幾個美洲國家的代表堅持自己的意見，認爲阿根廷的情形好轉了。現在我只有請求你們，給蘇聯代表團以及其他代表團一個可能認識道種事實的相當期間，以便使之相信阿根廷的情形是否眞像某幾個美洲國家代表所說。爲能達到這一點，就需要一些研究時間，最低限度也　要研究幾天。</p>
<p>請平心靜氣地考慮一下：假如馬馬虎虎，不經過縝密地考慮，怱忙邀請在戰爭時期曾幫助我們敵人法西斯蒂軸心國的阿根廷出席本會，而不邀請聯合國之一的波蘭，該會發生什麼影響？</p>
<p>誰都曉得，波蘭在此次戰爭期間，在聯合國的隊伍中是有光榮地位的，因爲它曾用盡所有力量反對我們的共同敵人。英勇的波蘭人民，過去和現在都始終同我們並肩作戰着。他們過去和現在進行着極大的犧性。所有這一切，我們無論如何都是不能忘懷的。</p>
<p>邀請一個自始至終在此次大戰期問帮助我們共同敵人的阿根廷出席會議。而不邀請一個現在在波蘭解放區內擁有波蘭人民絕大威信和愛戴的波籣臨時政府出席會議，－如這樣不合人情和事理地作下去，對於本會議的威信，將一落千丈，或因而完全掃地。任何人都不能否認，波蘭政府是民主政體。這一個波蘭臨時政府，受到人民的極大擁護和支持，並和我們的同盟國家共同進行反對我們共同敵人的鬥爭。我們還記得，美英蘇三國政府，曾決心援助波要，放寬尺度地改組這一政府。</p>
<p>我堅決相信這一祟高的決議，也是十足反映波蘭人矣願望的，而我們就不應當躊躇徘徊，而要以最大的速度早日努力執行這一決議才對。我們自然也知道，改組波蘭政府的這一問題，並非本會的工作。這一問題，是上述三聯合國政府的工作，特別也是波蘭人民本身的工作。我們全都希望，波蘭政府在更廣大的民主基礎上建立起來，並且也希望，所有的聯合國政府與它建立起外交關係來。選話是對的。然而，假如說在本會上對於波蘭問題不應作一個一般的決定，那末我們就不要忽略一個事實，即目前在舉行着一個沒有波蘭人民代表所參加的會議。無論怎樣强詞奪理，在本會上不給我們英勇的戰鬥同盟者波籣人民代表一個位置，而給在戰爭上不僅不幫助我們而且幫助我們敵人的阿根廷代表一個位置，這是不可以的。</p>
<p>別人有權利來對我說，阿根廷有罪惡，但這些罪惡是可以不計較的。問題或許也可以道樣提出來，阿根廷的罪惡或許可以不去計較，然而我要反問一句：假如可以忘記阿根廷的某些罪惡，那末我們又爲什麼必須要忘記波蘭的戰爭功勞呢？又爲什麼我們必須要忘記波籣人民反對我們共同敵人的偉大戰鬥貢獻呢？</p>
<p>在我們這個會塲上有印度的代表團，但印度並不是一個獨立的國家。我們全都知道，總有一天會聽到獨立印度人民呼聲的。因而我們總是同意了英國政府的意見，關於在目前的條件下給現在不完整的印度代表一個議席。</p>
<p>在我們道個會塲上有菲律賓的代表團，然而菲律賓也並不是一個獨立國家。我們很淸楚地知道，也總有一天會聽到獨立菲律賓呼聲的。但我們同意了美國政府，給目前菲律賓人民以發言的機會。一直到現在和蘇聯沒有外交關係的國家，其中有好多都參加了此次會議。雖然如此，但是蘇聯政府接受了英美兩國的提議，並未因該國與邀請國沒有外交關係而反對其參加此次會議。我們認爲：在這一問題上我們也應當接受英美兩國的意見。在所有這些問題上，已經表示出蘇聯政府跟其他邀請國關於會議問題的態度。前此所有邀請他國入會的這種行爲，在該會立於同等地位的四大邀請國，總是意見一致的。我們認爲這是最好的一種作風，而我們反對破壞這種團結者。</p>
<p>我認爲我們大家都應當尊重和實賣我們的團結一致，並且我們大家都應當努力作到，給他國一個謹愼和嚴重考慮一切新提議的機會，方才所提出的議案，我們中間就有某些國家從未得到之分考憂的機會。所以我認爲關於阿根廷的問題，也不要用道樣方法來解決，即不要忙草率地夾解決。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表團的提議，歸納起來說，就是邀請阿根廷入會的問題，延長幾天研究的機會來討論。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表團的請求只有這一點（譯自五月三日上海俄文新生活報）</p>

<h3>三年來之靜安寺</h3>
<p>工作一斑</p>
<p>該寺三年來之重要工作，大約如下：</p>
<p>佛敎講座：該寺在兩年以前爲求佛教學理，能有學術性之討論，佛敎精神普及社會各階層起見，創辦佛教講座，敦請佛教學者如興慈·持松·芝峯·季　諸法師擔任講師。上月十五日第三屆繼續開始，恭請華嚴宗尊宿應慈老法師宣講「華嚴法界玄鏡」。歷屆每次聽眾中，有教授學者銀行家公務員學生等，常達二三百人以上，其問曾有　風雨長途跋涉前來聽講者。此種探求佛學之精神，至堪欽慕。</p>
<p>佛教星期學術講座：三十一年夏該寺發起佛教星期學術講座，當時有鑒於滬上研究學術風氣之消沉，及青年思想情緒之苦悶，利用星期假日，討論普通各科學術與佛學之比較，參加講出者有了福保氏之「佛學與科學」范古幾氏之「佛教與人生」，馬公愚氏之「佛學與藝術」，持松法師之「佛教與哲學」，姚明煇氏之「佛教與孔教」，趙百辛氏之「佛學與文學」，圓瑛法師之「佛教與做人」，趙構初氏之「大乘佛學與救濟事業」，陳彬龢氏之「明需朱舜水對於日本文化之賞獸」等。演講次數共達四十餘期，各界人士之前往聽講者六萬餘人，　後因環境關係，暫時停頓。</p>
<p>佛教助學金：戰事以後，滬上青年失學者日多，因此該寺在三十二年夏舉辦佛教助學金，最初受助者有復旦·大夏·聖約翰·比較法學院。同德醫學院等各大學諸生，共後名額增加，中學生前來申請者亦有補助，同時在去年之秋，曾聯合本市諸山，集款助學，分送由新兩報轉助各校學生。</p>
<p>佛教南翔鄉村小學：該寺在南翔鎭之西北，設有下院田地七十餘畝，附近村莊中之兒童，因離錢太遠，失學甚多，該寺遂於去年秋季利用下院之　　反空地，創辦「佛教爾翔鄉村小學」，承本寺諸護法及當地人士之熱心贊助，不久即告籌備成立。第一學期來校學生六七十人，本學期人數增加，已達一百餘名。</p>
<p>佛教名著翻譯：近年以來一般文化人對於學術上之研究。因種種關係日見停頓，該寺爲提倡佛教文化及研究高潔學術起見，發起翻譯佛教名著，學者如芝峯法師·黃妙悟·林子靑·陳嘯仙諸氏均時有惠稿，俟戰事以後，即可付印，集爲叢書。</p>
<p>整飭寺務內部：修理殿宇，建築後廳走廊翻造新廳等；整理寺產，收回租地修　契約等；改正法事，取消法事中之不良習俗，如破血湖破地獄等；莊嚴　塲，禁輩禁賭等</p>
<p>目前計劃</p>
<p>該寺目前之實要計劃，爲重建山門及竪立古蹟湧泉梵幢。蓋該寺之殿宇房屋，素極寬廣，前因基地出租，建築失常，以致位於交通銀行鄰近之西首山門，偏居一角，不便啓閉，而東首山門，則又因市房出租，有礙觀瞻。去歲爲提前收同寺門兩旁市房之產權，幾經交涉，有半載之久，後承李思浩。陳彬龢，孫春生諸護法鼎力疎通，尤蒙次承租者匯中銀行黃雨府氏維獲古剎之意，始能圓滿解決。該寺擬於收回後，重建山門，並在門前之湧泉井畔，豎立梵　，以彰古蹟。</p>
<p>今後希望</p>
<p>該寺今後希望實行者有下列數端；</p>
<p>開辦僧學院，以培談佛教弘法人才。</p>
<p>建立法藏館，以蒐羅古今中外佛教典籍，及佛教美術等法物，供眾閱覺。</p>
<p>創辦民衆學校，輔助社會教育。</p>
<p>創辦貧民診療所，救濟貧病同胞。</p>
<p>興辦農塲，以奠定生產事業之基礎。</p>
<p>籌設佛敎食堂，便利滬西一帶公務員及低薪階級之出外用膳。</p>
<h3>本市金融市況上週已趨穩琮一般物價仍趨上漲</h3>
<p>本市金融市况，最近一週，雖在歐局演燮之中，因受當局施以種種之壓力，投機市儈，無法操縱，故漲落不若過去之鉅。烚赤週四一度狂漲，及時退落，至週六上午收市爲止，市價較前週六收價上升甚微，大致巳趨盤旋之勢。公價始終疲而不興，股票上半週均見步高，下半週盤旋微小，人心尚　堅挺。銀根雖有中儲放出大批頭寸趨鬆，價格於財政當局撿查取締之嚴，故均不敢任意放縱，多頭觀望，散戶略有零星吐出，是以至週六收市，股票市情普遍小跌。蓋市塲消息中儲發行金證券，物價勢將壓平，股市不無影響。至於工商方面，尚稱穩定，米雜糧等市價平靜，惟棉織品及其他日用品，一般物價節節上漲，尤其五月一日起，各種事輛電力電氣自來水等公用事業，增加二倍至三借。各種物資運輸轉輾　用，成本加鉅，刺激物價上漲，其勢更爲可慮。茲悉本市經濟有關各當局，爲澈底抑平物價，除繼續厲行取締囤積居奇操縱等揩置外，正積極設法恢復工廠動力，增加生產，及改善交通運輪疏通貨物來源，以解除上海市民生活當前困苦。</p>
<h3>市經濟局裁撤第七科</h3>
<p>上海特別市經濟局，爲增强行政效華起見，特將第七科裁撤，所有七科調查事務，併由視察室辦理，統計事務　併第一科辦理。</p>

<p>長寗路警察分局，自姚本元調任局長後，對於境內無塲，向取嚴格主義，邇近自寬放鐘點後，查察更形認真，一逾規定時簡，即不徇情面，立予傳局處分，絲毫無通融餘地，以故陸克西　塲，愚國咖啡館，曼濃韋陀酒吧間等三家，均先後自動停止營業，阿根廷外國總會亦在無形停頓中，昨夜鄉下飯店三次逾時違章，被該分局查悉，報由總局下令，處以停業十天以儆。聞長寗區內共有舞場六家，已有五家停業，足見該警局取締之嚴厲。</p>
<h3>顧保甲處長今日廣播</h3>
<p>本市警察局保甲處長顧繼武，將於今（七）日下午九時半，假本市上海電臺廣播，講題爲「我對於辦理保甲工作」，全市民眾，可屆時收聽。</p>

<p>中央海軍學校第四期軍官學生，業巳修業滿期，定於本（五）月十一日上午九時，在龍華路該校舉行畢業典禮，屆時海軍部長凌霄校長姜西園等，均將親臨主持。</p>
<h3>重建靜安寺山門昨商討募款辦法</h3>
<p>本市靜安寺昨爲勸募重建山門，由護法會李思浩陳彬龢孫春生吳民芳諸居士等，發起邀請各界舉行茶會，到有聞籣亭吳蘊齊潘三省黃振世沈長廣等六十餘人，席間共同商討集款採聯建築等計劃，並即分別認募，聞在各界人士熱忱贊助下，結果甚爲圓滿，不久當可興工。</p>

<p>現在的上海都市交通股份公司，是由事變前英商電車公司，蛻變而成。英商電車公司創辦於一九〇六年，在開始時本爲中英合辦，但以營業淸淡，逐漸虧損，於是我國股東祝蘭芬等遂有退股之議，後由該公司前大班桃崙返偷敦向英金融界呼籲，經參加利銀行貸款援助，將我國人所有的股票全數收買，票面十元之股票僅拿回一元，從此全爲英人經營。當時民智未開，市民疑神疑鬼，不也乘坐。英人獨立經營後乃雇用一般失業遊民，每人給以藍短衫褲一套。終日坐於車上，日給飯資三角，並以花露水，牙粉，牙刷，香皂等物贈送乘客。至是翠疑始怯，乘客日多。最初的電車是有軌八路知七路，以後又增一路二路，每路每天行駛的電車有六七輛。此後營業日益發達，添購車輛，至此共有軌電車一百二十八輛，又有德貨西門十車廿輔已出賣與天津方面，現開行者不足百輛；無軌電車有二百　，現開行者僅三十辆左右。然每日營業收入較前反多，利潤率也超過了戰前達八九千倍。</p>
<p>英人管理下之電車</p>
<p>當時，英商電車公司的主要產業，便是前述的有軌和無軌電車。以赫德路八〇號老車站爲根據，以後又在楊樹浦路滙山碼頭建立了新車站。自二次滬戰後，則暫合併於老車站方面，可是管理手續還是獨立性的，在倍開爾路則有電車修理廠，其內部組織一爲車務部，以司機與　票爲骨幹，在人數上及工作上都佔極重奪的地位，其次爲機務部，普通　銅匠問，是電車公司中最有組織性和實際力量的一部份。這完全由於工作關係上與工作時間上能有更多聯絡機會，不像車務部組識散漫，早晚不能相見，司機與賣票也常有磨擦，當時的生持者英人便常利用道一矛盾，進行挑撥分化手段，達其奴役我國工人之目的。</p>
<p>英商電車公司之行政管理系統，最高職位爲大板，亦即總經理。從前電車公司的職業大都認爲是一種進益豐富的職業，鑽謀的很多，甚至有以預付相當代價爲進公司的敲門磚者。被開除的工人，也有以用錢得到復職的。再次，有些老工人或職員，在公司服務已經多年，照章告退時應給以退職金，可是當時主持公司的英人往往藉敵開除，這樣就半個退職金也沒有，但據熟悉內幕者云，在公司的報告中仍爲「退職」，退職金也照數付給，道數目如祥細統計起來，也頗可觀。可見英人的腐敗。</p>
<p>職工籍貨年齡分析</p>
<p>現在，公司全體職工共計三千弱。（任高級職員的外國人一百廿名不在內）以車務部職工佔絕大多數，其次爲機務部。以職務分別之計有賣票員一千二百人，司機人六百人，查票員五百人，工人（包括：拉綫·撬路·銅匠·鐵匠·木·電燈匠·加袖及修綫者等」四百多人，小工二百多人。</p>
<p>這些職工多數是從農村中分化出來的，籍貫，車務部以蘇北人估多數，尤其是鹽城。其次是無錫，蘇州，鎭江一帶。機務部以寗波籍佔多數，約佔十分之六，其次本地，揚州，無錫，安徽籍佔十分之二、蘇北幫佔十分之二，大都爲鐵匠和小工。</p>
<p>工人年齡以三十至四十歲者爲最多，次爲二十以上至三十者。四十以上的司機要比賣票多，機務部職工的年齡也相當大，道完全由於上兩種工作，需要熟練技術的關係，流動性比較小些。</p>
<p>依性別來說。電車公司還找不出女性的工人和職員，代外國，女子服務於交通機關却是極平常的，日本和蘇聯女性之服務於交通機關者非常普　，甚至司機，銅匠，也有録用女性的。</p>
<p>目前職工待遇情形</p>
<p>職工工資有按時，按日，按月計算三種。職員大多是按月計算，司機賣票則按日給薪，機榜部之銅匠，小工均按時計。同時工資高低不一，即同一職位之工資，也以服務時間之久暫而不同。最近查票的最高薪額是四萬四十元，賣票·司機每月可得三萬五千元左右，普通工人每月僅拿到三萬多點。前次票價加二倍多，薪工也加了三成，五月一號電車車資加兩借後，工資的增加比率澴沒有公布，按渦去慣例，加薪事前並不公佈，發薪時始能知道。發薪日期，每月分兩次，一次是十三日，一次是廿七日。配給米每月可有三斗光景，不過有多有少，每斗價一千三百多元。</p>
<p>升工方面，各部不同，司機和實票也不一律，賣票在一個月內做滿廿六天，可得升工四天，司機在一個月內做滿廿六天，則得升工三天。在實際上所謂升工，就是禮拜工的意思，外人企業大多數按照星期日休息，而電車工人却不能在星期日放假，只有輸流。照理每逢星期要給以一天的工資，但司機和賣票假使在一月裏只做廿五天或廿五天半，升工就沒有，這樣工人每星期應有的休息日和應給予的工資就完全失去。有時甚至作了二十五天半，而派班的却停止了最後半天的工作，升工自然輪不到了</p>
<p>工人病假，不給工資，職員病假，過去薪金照給，現在民被取消。工人如因公受傷，工資可照給，但死亡的人則依工作年數及平時服務動惰做標準，給以少許撫恤金。倘因公死亡者，可得以往全部工作時間十二分之一的撫恤費。</p>
<p>退職金是須忠勤服務滿十五年，而年齡過五十五歲，經醫師證明年老而始發給的。其數額是全部工作年代的廿四分之一，例如滿十五年者可得七個半月的退職金。滿廿年者可得十二分之一的退職金。可是時常有許多職工服務已滿廿多年，因故停聯，養老金完全沒有。</p>

<h3>Japan's Response to Rapidly Changing European Situation: Retaining Freedom of Action; Foreign Minister Togo Declares Germany Has Violated Agreements</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Togo met with newspaper reporters at his official residence at 11:00 AM on the 6th. In response to reporters' questions regarding the potential impact on Japan's diplomatic relations with Germany, in light of Commander-in-Chief of the German Home Army Himmler's plea for peace with Britain and the United States, and Grand Admiral Dönitz's declaration of continuing the war against the Soviet Union, the Minister replied as follows: Himmler's plea to Britain and the United States and Dönitz's assumption of power and broadcast clearly indicate Germany's intentions, which are to wage war against the Soviet Union, while seeking peace with Britain and the United States. This is not only entirely different from the Empire's policy of maintaining neutrality with the Soviet Union while fighting Britain and the United States, but also a serious violation of the tripartite agreement of not concluding a separate peace. Therefore, once the situation is confirmed, the Empire will retain the freedom to act based on a new perspective regarding the tripartite agreement and other political measures between Japan and Germany. The Empire's attitude toward the rapidly changing situation in Europe has already been made clear. The following is a record of the conversation:</p>
<p>Most of the information regarding the recent situation in Germany is provided by the enemy, and thus carries propaganda undertones and contains contradictions. However, regarding Commander-in-Chief of the Home Army Himmler's plea for surrender to Britain and the United States, and Grand Admiral Dönitz's broadcast upon assuming office, emphasizing the continuation of the war against the Soviet Union, and offering an armistice to Britain and the United States on the condition that it does not hinder Germany's war against the Soviet Union, the information is generally consistent. If Germany's attitude is indeed as such, then its intent is to prioritize the war against the Soviet Union and seek peace with Britain and the United States. This differs from the Japanese Empire's purpose of maintaining neutrality with the Soviet Union and advancing toward war with Britain and the United States. Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that Germany, after the death of Führer Hitler, is capable of taking actions suitable to the tripartite agreement to jointly complete the war. Therefore, once the situation is confirmed, the Empire will have the right to act freely based on a new perspective regarding the tripartite agreement and other political measures between Japan and Germany. Regardless of Germany's attitude, Japan's determination to carry out the war against Britain and the United States will not be shaken in the slightest, as already clarified in Prime Minister Suzuki's statement.</p>
<h3>Over Forty Enemy Ships Sunk or Destroyed Around Okinawa: Imperial General Headquarters Announces Fierce Attack Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 6th: Japanese air force units have continued to attack enemy air bases on Okinawa Island and enemy ships and mobile units surrounding the island. Since May 3rd, continuous fierce attacks have inflicted enormous damage on the enemy. From May 3rd to the present, the war results confirmed by the Japanese side are as follows: Sunk: one converted aircraft carrier, three battleships, one cruiser, four cruisers or destroyers, one destroyer, one minesweeper, four ships of unknown type (including one large ship), and one transport ship. Destroyed: three converted aircraft carriers, one cruiser, one destroyer, and one transport ship. Over twenty ships were hit and caught fire. Most of the air units participating in this attack were special attack units. Japanese submarines attacked enemy supply units heading north in the sea south of Okinawa Island from the night of May 1st to the morning of the 2nd, sinking one large transport ship, two destroyers, and two ships of unknown type.</p>
<p>Statement by Department Head Matsushima</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report - On May 6th, the Imperial General Headquarters announced that Japanese forces in the Okinawa area had sunk another twenty-seven enemy ships. The cumulative war results of the Japanese military's operations in that area total 498 enemy ships sunk or destroyed. Colonel Matsushima, the Naval Press Director stationed in China, issued a statement, asserting that the enemy's naval power has suffered a crushing blow, and the Japanese military has completely seized the initiative in the operation. Furthermore, he described the enemy's predicament as follows: The enemy mobile units off the Nansei Islands have suffered significant damage and are unable to operate. Japanese air force and submarine units have also inflicted damage on enemy ships supporting land operations around Okinawa. The enemy forces on Okinawa Island have faced fierce counterattacks from the Japanese army for several days. As a result, the U.S. Army's 77th Division and the 1st Marine Division on the northern front have been transferred to the south for reinforcement. The U.S. 96th Division in front of Shuri City, which the enemy had claimed to be 800 yards from the city a few days ago, now admits in its May 5th battle report that the U.S. forces have retreated to a location 2,600 yards from the city. According to enemy reports, Japanese forces landed on the enemy's rear on Okinawa Island by boat on the night of the 4th, causing great confusion in the U.S. rear. Thus, the enemy forces in the Okinawa area are under pressure from the Japanese army, navy, and air force, and are in a very difficult situation. Enemy sea lanes are about to be cut off, and rescue is impossible. The 100,000 U.S. troops on the island are about to face complete destruction. This proves that the situation in Europe has absolutely no impact on Japanese military operations. On the contrary, the Japanese army is advancing with greater strength to reduce British and American forces.</p>
<h3>Japan Determined Not To Be Influenced By Dönitz's Unilateral Actions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the current situation in Germany after the death of Führer Hitler, news from various sources in Europe unanimously reports that Germany is conducting peace negotiations with Britain and the United States, the common enemies of Japan, Germany, and Italy, while continuing to resist the Soviet Union, with whom Japan maintains neutral relations. Foreign Minister Togo met with a group of reporters on the 6th and clarified Japan's independent stance on the rapidly changing situation in Europe, explaining that this new situation is actually a violation of the separate peace agreement concluded by Japan, Germany, and Italy after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. If this news is confirmed, Japan will hereafter act from a new perspective and obtain the freedom to act. At the same time, he stated that even though Germany has lost its capacity for joint warfare, it will have no influence on the Japanese government's determination to complete the Greater East Asia Defense War. The Japan-Germany-Italy separate peace treaty was signed in Berlin on December 11, 1941, not long after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Article 1 of the agreement stipulates that Japan, Germany, and Italy shall carry out the war forced upon them by Britain with all their might until victory. Article 2 stipulates that Japan, Germany, and Italy shall not cease hostilities or make peace with either Britain or the United States without complete mutual understanding. Article 3 stipulates that the three countries must also closely cooperate after the completion of the war to establish a just new order as stipulated in the Tripartite Pact of September 27, 1940. From the above, it can be seen that the agreement not only stipulated that a separate peace would not be concluded, but also pledged cooperation in building a new order in East Asia and Europe after the war. However, according to the European situation, Himmler, a core leader of the German National Socialist Party, commander-in-chief of the domestic army, and minister of the interior, who controls the national police power and is the most powerful figure in Germany after the death of Führer Hitler, has suggested unconditional surrender to Britain and the United States. This information has not only been acknowledged by British and American officials, but also confirmed by the neutral Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Furthermore, Dönitz stated in his broadcast to the nation upon assuming the position of head of state: "My first task is to save the German people from Bolshevik destruction. To achieve this goal, we must continue to fight. If Britain and the United States hinder our efforts to achieve this goal, then we will also continue to fight Britain and the United States." He clearly indicated that the continuation of the war against Britain and the United States would only be implemented when the British and American forces hinder the war against the Soviet Union. Dönitz's statement is completely contrary to Japan's war aims of crushing Britain and the United States in order to achieve self-existence and self-defense in Greater East Asia. Furthermore, it is not consistent with Japan's policy of maintaining neutrality with the Soviet Union in order to maintain stability in East Asia. From this, it can be seen that the Dönitz government has completely abandoned the intention of cooperating with Japan to complete the joint war against Britain and the United States. Regarding Dönitz's statement, the following facts can be used as evidence:</p>
<p>1.  German Armaments Minister Speer, in a broadcast speech on the 3rd, asked the people to actively cooperate with the enemy British and Americans. He stated that the railway organization should be restored as soon as possible and, with the permission or order of the British and Americans, do its best to transport food to areas threatened by starvation.</p>
<p>2.  German troops in northwestern Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands under the command of Dönitz have successively requested surrender.</p>
<p>3.  The anti-resistance strongholds of Prague and Kiel have been declared undefended cities, especially Kiel, which is a naval port under the direct command of Dönitz.</p>
<p>4.  It is reported that the representatives of the Norwegian garrison have also requested unconditional surrender to Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the domestic situation in Germany since the death of Hitler has been collapsing, and the process is very clear. Therefore, Japan must adopt its own policies to deal with the rapidly changing situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Launch Attack on the Island</p>
<p>Nansei Islands, 6th (Central News Agency) - Enemy forces on Okinawa Island have launched general attacks several times, and each time they have been thwarted by the brave fighting of the Japanese defenders, but the enemy forces are still preparing for the next offensive. The Japanese land forces, in response to the special attack units and air force, have launched a major offensive against the enemy mobile forces since the 3rd, and the major attack began on the morning of the 4th. The enemy's front lines have already been shaken, and the Japanese military's advance is very smooth.</p>
<p>Nansei Islands Base, 6th (Central News Agency) - From the afternoon to the evening of the 5th, Japanese air force units attacked the island's airport several times. Large fires broke out in several places at the northern airfield, and they penetrated the enemy fleet, carrying out daring torpedo attacks on two cruisers and one destroyer. About 400 enemy aircraft attacked the archipelago line on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Combined War Results of Japanese Naval and Air Attacks: A Total of 498 Ships Sunk or Destroyed</h3>

<h3>Yamazaki Promoted to President of South Manchuria Railway</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - After President of the South Manchuria Railway, Koiso Naoto, assumed the post of Minister of Transportation and Communications, Vice President Yamazaki Motoki was promoted to President.</p>
<h3>Greater East Asia Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The weekly war situation in various parts of Greater East Asia is as follows:</p>
<p>Okinawa Area</p>
<p>Since the 26th, Japanese forces have repeatedly broken through enemy attacks in front of the lines and have launched strong counterattacks from all sides. Japanese special attack units and air units have also responded to the counterattacks of ground units, inflicting heavy blows on enemy fleets and enemy bases around the island, causing confusion in the enemy camp, and the bombardment and bombing of the enemy fleets have gradually decreased. This week, enemy mobile units continued to shell the archipelago line from Amami Oshima to Sakishima Islands, and their activities have become more passive. Most of the fleet and air force gathered by the enemy have been sunk or destroyed. In order to remedy the decline, the enemy is actively expanding the airfields on Kerama Islands, Kamiyama Island, Ie Island, and the northern and central airfields of the main island, and is eager to quickly use the air force to destroy Okinawa, but it has been subjected to Japanese night air raids, which have bombed and destroyed enemy materials, fuel, and supplies, causing fires. Therefore, the enemy's airbase operations are becoming increasingly difficult, and it is still attempting to increase supplies from the Calcutta area, but about 600 of the enemy's large aircraft are involved in tactical operations this week.</p>
<p>Philippine Sea Area</p>
<p>This week, the enemy strongly promoted the attack, targeting Ormoc, and fierce battles unfolded day and night in various places.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific</p>
<p>On the 27th, an enemy fleet attacked the Tarakan area. From the night of the 30th to the morning of the 1st, enemy troops landed in Lingkas, and fierce battles unfolded in various places. Air raids continue on Balikpapan and the Celebes resource areas.</p>
<p>Burma Area</p>
<p>Between Mandalay and Rangoon, enemy armored units gradually advanced south. On April 28, the enemy on the right bank of the Irrawaddy River simultaneously invaded Akyab. In southern Burma, on May 1, the enemy landed airborne units near Rangoon, and at the same time, invaded the mouth of the Rangoon River with landing craft, appearing to be beginning landing operations.</p>
<p>Indian Ocean Area</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th, a British mobile unit, including aircraft carriers, appeared off Car Nicobar Island. In the afternoon, a part of it attacked Port Blair, shelling the land. The next day, enemy mobile units attacked Car Nicobar again, shelling the land. On the 3rd, several destroyers attacked Taikoku in the east during the day.</p>
<p>China Area</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in the Laohekou area secured the surrounding key lines and destroyed the enemy forces in the 1st and 5th War Zones facing them. In addition, a part of the 55th Army's main force in the Xinyiye area, 50 kilometers south of Nanyang, was being annihilated. On April 14, Japanese troops began operations from Ningxiang, Yongfeng, Shaoqing, and Dong'an west of the Yuehan Line. The enemy's 13th and 74th Armies, totaling seven divisions, carried out annihilation warfare. Currently, they are fiercely attacking the troops stubbornly resisting on the rugged Xuefeng Mountains.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Way to Stabilize People's Hearts</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the rapid changes in the European situation, people's minds in various parts of East Asia have been slightly stimulated. However, in order to win the Greater East Asia War, both the government authorities and social leaders should do their best to induce public sentiment to become calm. Because those who are flustered and impatient in the face of events will inevitably fail. Only in calmness can one accurately judge the trend of events and plan appropriate countermeasures. Therefore, in today's environment, we hope that people from all walks of life will observe the rapidly changing situation with a calm mind. In other words, the more urgent and tense the situation becomes, the more stable and calm people's hearts should appear. The stability of people's hearts can be reflected in both the government and the people. At the same time, only through the joint efforts of the government and the people can people's hearts be stabilized. On the government side, we advocate strengthening its position and promoting strong politics. On the negative side, of course, it is to prevent rumors and speculation and eliminate all genes that could confuse people's hearts. The recent rapid changes in the German-Italian war situation did not cause as much fluctuation in people's minds in Shanghai and other places as expected. This is the result of the recent efforts of the party authorities to curb rumors and speculation. At the same time, accurate reports of the truth of the situation at any time prevent speculators and enemy propaganda from taking advantage of it and prevent them from using false and misleading information to incite people's hearts. This is the recent progress of the government in stabilizing people's hearts.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the main thing is to strengthen the government's position and create a strong government. Only by promoting strong politics can the government demonstrate that it has a real grasp of national affairs and public security and that it has the ability to fulfill its responsibilities. Then any enemy strategy will not be able to exert its skills, and people's hearts will naturally be stabilized. In order to achieve this, the government must enhance its political prestige, effectively protect all the legitimate rights of the people, and further improve the people's lives, such as stabilizing currency values, curbing prices, and fair rationing. More importantly, it is necessary to further promote production and construction.</p>
<p>On the people's side, as long as the government can do the above two things, we believe that not only will people's hearts not be shaken by any external stimulus, but they will definitely rise up and cooperate automatically. The recent changes in the international situation have not caused any major fluctuations in people's minds in various places. As the editorial of the Mainland News Agency on the 4th of this month pointed out, this is because the government has done quite a bit of the above two things. However, to stabilize people's hearts, the people and the government must be equally responsible. We certainly hope that the government can do the above two things first, but at the same time, the people must also show trust in the government and cooperation with government policies. For example, the recent construction of the Soochow-Shanghai Highway and rural loans initiated by the government are enough to show that the government has the ability, determination, and strength to do things. Our people should also do their best to assist, and at the same time, some powerful people in the private sector should initiate and undertake some production and construction projects without waiting for the government to start them. For example, the recent Zhejiang gentry initiated the construction of the Zhejiang seawall project, which is the best example.</p>
<p>In short, at a time of turbulent situations, people's hearts need to be stabilized. How to stabilize people's hearts requires the government and the people to strengthen themselves on the one hand and cooperate with each other on the other. Therefore, under this kind of need, there is absolutely no room for those who only know how to be selfish and disregard public interests, nor is there any room for those who stand by and watch or evade responsibility. Only by actively taking responsibility together and constantly adapting to the changes in the situation through continuous efforts can we fundamentally stabilize people's hearts.</p>
<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>The European Situation and the Hearts of the Chinese People</h3>
<p>Under the rule of the National Government, political opportunists still survive. In Shanghai and other commercial centers, there are also many who are addicted to speculation, and they even use the misfortune of their motherland as a means of profiteering. The atmosphere created by these elements is truly disheartening for the pursuit of war. However, this evil trend has recently shown signs of gradual correction, which is worth noting. Against the backdrop of the rapid changes in the European situation, such as the fall of Berlin and the death of Hitler, some people have worried that the hearts of the people in Shanghai and other places will be shaken and uneasy, but in fact, not only has this kind of worry now been dispelled, but the general trend is exactly the opposite of what was expected, which is very gratifying in friendly China.</p>
<p>When the news of the fall of Berlin and other news came, the Shanghai market was quite calm, which was contrary to expectations. The prices of raw cotton, customs gold, public bonds, and food, which were expected to soar, continued to maintain their original state. This is naturally due to the efforts of the authorities to crack down, but it mainly reflects the stability of the hearts of the Chinese people, so that the tricks of speculators and opportunists are also unable to succeed. Perhaps some people say that the situation in Europe has been a local event since the middle of last month, so no greater fluctuations will occur now, but comparing today's market situation with the situation after the 15th of last month, this statement is very inappropriate and needs no argument.</p>
<p>The second noteworthy fact is that the so-called 5 billion yuan rural loan, the evacuation of small factories, etc., are particularly important at this stage and are being put into practice, which can completely dispel the蠢动 of political opportunists. Putting this long-term and sustainable construction work into practice can be regarded as the people expressing that they do not have any worries about the changes in the situation and are willing to continue to cooperate in carrying out the war. In particular, such as the 5 billion yuan rural loan, which was completely initiated by the private sector and has the cooperation of all the citizens of Shanghai, we can find its great significance here.</p>
<p>In the past, the hearts of the people in various places have almost always been stable, and they have only sometimes been slightly changed by reflecting the dynamics of Shanghai, but today, the reasons for inducing this kind of change are being eliminated. Therefore, there is no doubt that stability can be sustained forever. The so-called psychological construction in wartime has gradually possessed the conditions to enter the active stage today.</p>
<p>We have always had an optimistic tendency about the stability of the hearts of the Chinese people, and now it has been confirmed against the backdrop of the changes in the European situation. The hearts of the Chinese people themselves originally desire stability, but because of the existence of various troublemakers, they have not been able to show their original appearance. Today, the trouble-making work will eventually fail. We must take this opportunity to launch an ideological offensive in order to complete the psychological construction of wartime. Moving from the passive strategy of eliminating troublemakers to an ideological offensive and invigorating the development of public opinion work is a major issue facing the leaders of China and Japan today.

<h3>Lieutenant Kojima and Others of the Defense Capital Died a Heroic Death by Colliding</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on May 6: On April 7, Showa 20 (1945), the enemy launched an attack with fighter-bomber joint planes. Lieutenant Hideo Kojima and others of the Japanese Army intercepted enemy B-29 aircraft over the capital, dared to collide, and completed the great task of defending the capital with their bodies. Previously, the commander-in-chief of the General Army, Marshal Sugiyama Gen, awarded a commendation. Now it has been presented to His Majesty the Emperor. The following is a record: Lieutenant Hideo Kojima, the leader of the army, intercepted enemy aircraft, and in the sky over Tanashi, bravely carried out a collision attack on the B-29 aircraft, crushing them. He also died a heroic death himself. Lieutenant Kei Kono of the Army discovered a B-29 aircraft in the sky near Chofu and repeatedly attacked it.

After Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech, a preparatory meeting was held to organize the proposal review committee and various other committees to formally deliberate on the central issues of the congress, including the implementation of constitutional government and concrete plans for the National Assembly. In the preparatory meeting on the 5th, the agenda items proposed by representatives from various regions caused disputes. Four of these items are as follows: Improve the people's livelihood and immediately realize the Principle of the People's Livelihood. Fundamentally review foreign relations, especially the final review of the Soviet issue. The Kuomintang's exclusive organs, such as the Youth Training Corps, should be transferred to the government's Propaganda Department.

<h3>Full Text of Molotov's Speech on the Polish and Argentine Participation Issues at the San Francisco Conference</h3>
<p>At this San Francisco Conference, disputes have arisen one after another. The most noteworthy are the disputes between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States, and the resistance of small countries to the domination of large countries. In the former case, it is manifested in the number of votes, the issue of Polish and Argentine participation, and the Soviet Union's request for three votes. Regarding the issue of Polish and Argentine participation, this newspaper has selected and translated the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the plenary session on April 30 for reference.</p>
<p>[Editor's note: The current Soviet foreign policy in Europe is to establish pro-Soviet regimes around it. The proposal to invite Poland to participate in the San Francisco Conference is a concrete manifestation of this policy. However, this proposal was rejected at the plenary session on the 30th due to opposition from the United Kingdom and the United States.]</p>
<p>Chairman! Gentlemen!</p>
<p>The Soviet delegation believes that the Argentine issue, that is, the issue of inviting Argentina to attend this conference, is an extraordinary issue. Regarding this issue, I would like to say a few words in Russian, which not everyone can understand. However, I know that it is very appropriate to discuss the issue of justice in Russian, and I hope that everyone will understand and believe what I say. The issue of inviting Argentina to attend this conference was only suddenly raised among the delegations today. In the past, until now, not a single word has been discussed on this issue among the representatives of the four inviting countries. Therefore, it is easy to know that the Soviet delegation itself hopes to first understand this issue and also hopes to give all the representatives participating in this conference the opportunity to understand this issue. Therefore, the Soviet delegation proposes to extend the review of this issue for a few days.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Argentina has taken a special position in this war against our common enemy. Everyone knows that during this war, Argentina's foreign policy was not always approved by other Allied nations, and Argentina's internal affairs were always opposed by other Allied nations. To prove my words, let me temporarily quote a statement by former US Secretary of State Hull. It was announced on September 8, 1944, and said: "Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull condemned Argentina as the headquarters of the fascist movement in this hemisphere and as the den of evil fugitives from other American countries."</p>
<p>I will quote another statement that is most supported by the general public. It was said by US President Roosevelt on October 1, 1944, namely: "I am very concerned about the development of events in Argentina in recent months. The situation is extremely contradictory, that is, at a time when the forces of oppression and aggression in Europe and other parts of the world are increasingly approaching complete failure, this country in our hemisphere is developing Nazi and fascist influences and is also expanding the adoption of Nazi and fascist methods."</p>
<p>I believe that these two statements are by no means unfounded, but are completely true facts. However, the words are still in my ears, and only a few months have passed. Could it be said that the situation in Argentina has undergone a fundamental change since then? I heard representatives from several American countries insist on their opinions, believing that the situation in Argentina has improved. Now I can only ask you to give the Soviet delegation and other delegations a considerable period of time to understand this fact, so as to make them believe whether the situation in Argentina is really as said by representatives of certain American countries. To achieve this, some research time is needed, at least a few days.</p>
<p>Please calmly consider: If we carelessly and without thorough consideration hurriedly invite Argentina, which helped our enemy, the fascist Axis powers, during the war, to attend this conference, without inviting Poland, one of the United Nations, what impact will it have on the conference?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Poland has a glorious position in the ranks of the United Nations during this war, because it has used all its strength to oppose our common enemy. The heroic Polish people have always fought side by side with us in the past and present. They have made great sacrifices in the past and present. We cannot forget all of this under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Inviting Argentina, which has helped our common enemy from beginning to end during this war, to attend the conference, without inviting the Polish Provisional Government, which now has the great prestige and love of the Polish people in the Polish liberated area, - if we continue to do this inhumanely and unreasonably, the prestige of this conference will plummet or even be completely swept away. No one can deny that the Polish government is a democratic regime. This Polish Provisional Government has received great support from the people and is fighting against our common enemy together with our Allied countries. We still remember that the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were determined to help Poland and relax the standards to reorganize this government.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that this lofty resolution fully reflects the wishes of the Polish people, and we should not hesitate, but should strive to implement this resolution as soon as possible with the greatest speed. We naturally also know that the issue of reorganizing the Polish government is not the work of this conference. This issue is the work of the above-mentioned three Allied governments, and especially the work of the Polish people themselves. We all hope that the Polish government will be established on a broader democratic basis, and we also hope that all Allied governments will establish diplomatic relations with it. That's right. However, if we say that a general decision on the Polish issue should not be made at this conference, then we should not ignore the fact that a conference without the participation of representatives of the Polish people is currently being held. No matter how strongly we argue, it is not permissible to give a position at this conference to the representative of Argentina, which not only did not help us but also helped our enemy in the war, without giving a position to the representative of our heroic fighting ally, the Polish people.</p>
<p>Others have the right to say to me that Argentina is guilty, but these sins can be ignored. The question may also be raised in this way: Argentina's sins may be ignored, but I want to ask in return: If we can forget certain sins of Argentina, then why must we forget Poland's war merits? And why must we forget the great battle contribution of the Polish people against our common enemy?</p>
<p>There is a delegation from India in our conference, but India is not an independent country. We all know that one day we will hear the voice of the independent Indian people. Therefore, we have always agreed with the British government's opinion on giving a seat to the current incomplete Indian representative under the current conditions.</p>
<p>There is a delegation from the Philippines in our conference, but the Philippines is also not an independent country. We know very clearly that we will always hear the voice of the independent Philippines one day. But we agreed with the US government to give the people of the Philippines the opportunity to speak at present. Many countries that have no diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union until now have participated in this conference. Nevertheless, the Soviet government accepted the proposal of the United Kingdom and the United States and did not oppose their participation in this conference because the country had no diplomatic relations with the inviting country. We believe that we should also accept the opinions of the United Kingdom and the United States on this issue. In all these issues, the Soviet government has shown its attitude towards the conference issue to the other inviting countries. The four major inviting countries, which stand in the same position at this conference, have always agreed on this kind of behavior of inviting other countries to join the conference. We believe that this is the best practice, and we oppose those who destroy this unity.</p>
<p>I believe that we should all respect and practice our unity, and we should all strive to give other countries an opportunity to carefully and seriously consider all new proposals. Some of us have never had the opportunity to consider the proposals just made. Therefore, I believe that the issue of Argentina should not be resolved in this way, that is, do not resolve it hastily.</p>
<p>To sum up, the Soviet delegation's proposal is to extend the opportunity to study the issue of inviting Argentina to join the conference for a few days for discussion.</p>
<p>The Soviet delegation's request is only this. (Translated from the Shanghai Russian New Life newspaper on May 3)</p>

Merchants and citizens can redeem them with cash and checks or bank drafts payable by the bank. These gold certificates can be freely bought and sold in the market.

<h3>The Seventeenth Air Defense Day to Implement Various Training Programs, Citizens Should Comply with the Training Methods</h3>
<p>The day after tomorrow (9th) is the seventeenth Air Defense Day. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters will, as usual, expand the publicity of the significance of air defense and implement various air defense training programs. The time and methods of alarm training have been published in various newspapers yesterday. Citizens should pay attention to implementing various necessary measures in accordance with the specified time and the nature of the alarm. At the same time, in addition to the comprehensive training in local areas within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple, Jiangning Road, and Putuo Road third sub-bureaus, each district will still designate locations to hold various main training programs. The Huangpu and Laoza districts will jointly hold a large-scale exercise on Shanxi Road at 2:00 PM on that day. It is stipulated that each store will send three people to participate in the exercise. The police and Baojia air defense personnel will only stand in a guiding and assisting position, while ordinary citizens will be the main body. Other factories and buildings will also implement comprehensive training separately, with personnel from the Air Defense Headquarters and the respective sub-bureaus guiding them.</p>
<p>Training Time and Key Points</p>
<p>The key points that Baojia personnel and citizens should pay attention to are: Alarm messengers should pay attention to delivering alarms at the specified time. The use of alarm flags should be absolutely correct. Air defense equipment should be sorted out in advance. Air raid shelters should be properly maintained. Air defense lights should also be inspected and maintained at any time. Other matters related to air defense must be absolutely noted to avoid being caught off guard in an emergency.</p>
<p>Traffic Lights and Lights of Most Concern</p>
<p>It is also learned that the air defense authorities are particularly concerned about the control of lights and traffic, because this is the most important thing in air defense missions. Therefore, on this Air Defense Day, special attention is paid to the control of lights and traffic, and all the police and Baojia personnel are dispatched to strictly implement it. Citizens should strictly abide by and implement it. Those who violate it will be severely punished, and the regulations must be followed at ordinary times.</p>
<p>Today and Tomorrow's Broadcasting and Gong-Beating Methods</p>
<p>In order to make all citizens and Baojia air defense workers in this city clearly understand the sound of the gong alarm, the Municipal Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters has specifically broadcast the gong-beating method on Shanghai Radio on the two days of today (7th) and tomorrow (8th). At that time, the chief of the Propaganda Section, Ikeda, and the deputy chief of the Air Defense Section, Li Zhenhuan, will preside over the gong-beating. The time will be from 7:20 PM to 8:00 PM, and all citizens can listen to it during this time.</p>
<h3>The Business Control Association Holds Regular Board Meetings</h3>

A compilation committee was specially formed to prepare an overview of the control work over the past year and to ask the government for instructions on the implementation of control policies in the future. It is also learned that the association is scheduled to hold the eleventh joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the afternoon of the 9th of this month to discuss everything. The material purchase plans submitted by each control committee for this year will also be reviewed and discussed before being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>The Banking Industry Discusses the Development of Bill Issuance Methods</h3>
<p>The two banking industry guilds have jointly agreed on a method to facilitate payments:</p>
<p>Starting from May 16th, customers of various banks and trading houses who issue payment bills from banks and trading houses will have the last digit of the bill amount rounded to the hundreds place. The remaining amount below the hundreds place will be paid by the customer in cash. If there are still amounts below the hundreds place, the paying bank or trading house will only pay the full amount above the hundreds place, and will not pay the remaining amount. The issuance of various bills by banking colleagues will also be handled in accordance with the prescribed methods.</p>
<p>Starting from May, the settlement of various deposit and debit interest by banks and trading houses will be rounded to the yuan place, and the amount below the yuan place will not be counted.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Jing'an Temple Over the Past Three Years</h3>
<p>The important work of the temple in the past three years is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Buddhist Lectures: Two years ago, in order to have academic discussions on Buddhist teachings and to spread the Buddhist spirit to all levels of society, the temple founded Buddhist lectures and invited Buddhist scholars such as Xingci, Chishi, Zhifeng, and Ji Zhushi to serve as lecturers. The third session continued to begin on the 15th of last month, and Venerable Yingci, a senior monk of the Avatamsaka School, was invited to lecture on the "Avatamsaka Dharma World Profound Mirror." In each session, there were professors, scholars, bankers, civil servants, students, etc., often reaching more than two or three hundred people. Some of them even traveled long distances through wind and rain to attend the lectures. This spirit of exploring Buddhism is admirable.</p>
<p>Buddhist Sunday Academic Lectures: In the summer of the 1931, the temple initiated Buddhist Sunday academic lectures. At that time, in view of the decline of academic research in Shanghai and the depression of young people's thoughts and emotions, the temple used Sundays and holidays to discuss the comparison between general academic disciplines and Buddhism. The speakers included Fubao's "Buddhism and Science," Fan Guji's "Buddhism and Life," Ma Gongyu's "Buddhism and Art," Chishi Dharma Master's "Buddhism and Philosophy," Yao Minghui's "Buddhism and Confucianism," Zhao Baixin's "Buddhism and Literature," Yuan Ying Dharma Master's "Buddhism and Being a Person," Zhao Gochu's "Mahayana Buddhism and Relief Work," and Chen Binhe's "Ming Dynasty Zhu Shunshui's Appreciation of Japanese Culture," etc. The number of lectures totaled more than 40 sessions, and more than 60,000 people from all walks of life attended the lectures. Later, due to environmental reasons, it was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Buddhist Scholarship Fund: After the war, the number of young people in Shanghai who lost their studies increased. Therefore, the temple held a Buddhist scholarship fund in the summer of the 1932. Initially, the beneficiaries included students from Fudan, Datong, St. John's, and the Comparative Law Institute, as well as Tongde Medical College. Later, the number of places increased, and middle school students who came to apply were also subsidized. At the same time, in the autumn of last year, the temple united with the mountains in the city to collect funds for scholarships and distributed them to students in various schools through Xin and Liang newspapers.</p>
<p>Buddhist Nanxiang Village Elementary School: The temple has more than 70 acres of lower courtyard land in the northwest of Nanxiang Town. Children in nearby villages lost their studies because they were too far from the money. Therefore, the temple used the anti-vacant land in the lower courtyard in the autumn of last year to establish the "Buddhist Nanxiang Village Elementary School." With the enthusiastic support of the temple's Dharma protectors and local people, preparations were soon completed. In the first semester, there were 60-70 students at the school. The number of students has increased this semester, reaching more than 100.</p>
<p>Translation of Buddhist Masterpieces: In recent years, the academic research of general cultural figures has been stagnant due to various reasons. In order to promote Buddhist culture and study noble academics, the temple initiated the translation of Buddhist masterpieces. Scholars such as Zhifeng Dharma Master, Huang Miaowu, Lin Ziqing, and Chen Xiaoxian often contribute manuscripts, which can be printed and compiled into a series of books after the war.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Internal Temple Affairs: Repairing halls, building corridors in the back hall, rebuilding new halls, etc.; sorting out temple properties, recovering leased land, repairing contracts, etc.; correcting legal affairs, eliminating bad customs in legal affairs, such as breaking blood lakes and breaking hells, etc.; decorating the courtyard, banning generations and gambling, etc.</p>
<p>Current Plan</p>
<p>The current important plan of the temple is to rebuild the mountain gate and erect the ancient monument Yongquan Fantang. The temple's halls and houses are usually very wide. In the past, due to the leasing of the base, the construction was abnormal, so that the western mountain gate, located near the Bank of Communications, was located in a corner, which was inconvenient to open and close, while the eastern mountain gate was rented out to city houses, which was unsightly. Last year, in order to recover the property rights of the city houses on both sides of the temple gate in advance, after several negotiations, it took half a year. Later, with the strong mediation of Dharma protectors Li Sihao, Chen Binhe, and Sun Chunsheng, and especially with the intention of the sub-lessee Huang Yufu of the Huizhong Bank to protect the ancient temple, it was finally resolved satisfactorily. The temple plans to rebuild the mountain gate after recovering it and erect the Buddhist banner beside the Yongquan well in front of the gate to highlight the ancient monuments.</p>
<p>Future Hope</p>
<p>The following are the hopes of the temple in the future:</p>
<p>Establish a Buddhist seminary to cultivate Buddhist Dharma propagation talents.</p>
<p>Establish a Dharma Treasure Hall to collect ancient and modern Chinese and foreign Buddhist classics and Buddhist art objects for public reading and perception.</p>
<p>Establish a public school to assist social education.</p>
<p>Establish a free clinic for the poor to relieve the poor and sick compatriots.</p>
<p>Establish a farm to lay the foundation for the production business.</p>
<p>Set up a Buddhist cafeteria to facilitate the meals of civil servants and low-income people in the western part of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Financial Situation in Shanghai This Week Has Been Stable, but General Prices Are Still Rising</h3>
<p>In the financial situation of this city, although it is in the midst of the European situation, due to the imposition of various pressures by the authorities, speculators have been unable to manipulate it. Therefore, the rise and fall have not been as large as in the past. Although it rose sharply on Thursday, it fell in time. By the close of the market on Saturday morning, the market price had risen very slightly compared with the closing price on the previous Saturday, and it had generally tended to hover. The public price has been weak all the time, and the stock market has seen a gradual rise in the first half of the week and a slight hover in the second half of the week. People's hearts are still strong. Although there has been a large amount of loosening of funds released by the Central Reserve Bank, the prices have been strictly checked and cracked down by the financial authorities. Therefore, no one dares to indulge arbitrarily. The bulls are waiting and watching, and retail investors have slightly spit out sporadic funds. Therefore, by the close of the market on Saturday, the stock market has generally fallen slightly. The market news is that the issuance of gold certificates by the Central Reserve Bank will suppress prices, which will inevitably affect the stock market. As for the industrial and commercial sectors, they are still considered stable. The market prices of rice and miscellaneous grains are calm, but the general prices of cotton textiles and other daily necessities are rising steadily. Especially from May 1st, various public utilities such as vehicle electricity, electricity, and tap water have increased by two to three times. The cost of transporting various materials has increased, stimulating price increases, and the situation is even more worrying. It is learned that the relevant economic authorities in this city are actively trying to restore factory power, increase production, and improve transportation and logistics to dredge the source of goods in order to relieve the current difficulties in the lives of Shanghai citizens, in addition to continuing to strictly crack down on hoarding and speculation.</p>
<h3>City Economic Bureau Abolishes Seventh Section</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau, in order to enhance administrative efficiency, has specially abolished the Seventh Section. All investigation affairs of the Seventh Section will be handled by the Inspection Office, and statistical affairs will be handled by the First Section.</p>
<h3>Five Dance Halls in Changning District Close Down</h3>
<p>Since Yao Benyuan was transferred to the position of director of the Changning Road Police Sub-Bureau, he has adopted a strict approach towards dance halls within the district. Recently, after the relaxation of closing times, inspections have become even more rigorous. Any violation of the stipulated time limits, without any regard for personal connections, results in immediate summons and punishment by the bureau, leaving no room for compromise. Consequently, the Luck West Dance Hall, the Foolish Country Cafe, and the Man Nong Weituo Bar, among others, have all voluntarily ceased operations one after another. The Argentine Foreign General Assembly is also in a state of virtual suspension. Last night, the Countryside Hotel was found to have violated regulations by exceeding the time limit for the third time. The sub-bureau reported this to the general bureau, which ordered a ten-day suspension as a warning. It is reported that there are six dance halls in the Changning district, and five have already closed down, which demonstrates the strict enforcement of the police sub-bureau.</p>
<h3>Director Gu of the Baojia Office to Broadcast Today</h3>
<p>Gu Jiwu, the Director of the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, will broadcast at 9:30 PM this evening (the 7th) on the Shanghai Radio Station, speaking on the topic of "My Views on Handling Baojia Work." All citizens are welcome to listen at that time.</p>

The Minister of the Navy, Ling Xiao, and the President of the Academy, Jiang Xiyuan, will personally preside over the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Discussion on Fundraising Methods for Rebuilding Jing'an Temple's Mountain Gate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, for the purpose of raising funds to rebuild the mountain gate of Jing'an Temple in this city, lay Buddhists such as Li Sihao, Chen Binhe, Sun Chunsheng, and Wu Minfang initiated an invitation to all circles to hold a tea party. More than sixty people attended, including Wen Lantin, Wu Yunqi, Pan Sanxing, Huang Zenshi, and Shen Changguang. During the meeting, they jointly discussed plans for fundraising, selecting a contractor, and architectural plans, and immediately began to solicit donations. It is reported that with the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life, the results were very satisfactory, and construction will commence soon.</p>

<h3>This Office and Huisheng Hospital Jointly Organize Report on Assistance for Poor Women in Childbirth</h3>
<p>The Kangnaotuo Road Obstetrics Hospital in this city has always been very enthusiastic about providing services to the poor and sick. Through special arrangements by this office, free childbirth assistance is provided. For each parturient in April, the hospital stay is limited to a maximum of seven days, including delivery fees and meals, at a cost of only 3,000 yuan.

A total of ten women were hospitalized for delivery in April, and all of them had good outcomes. A total of 30,000 yuan was directly paid to the hospital by this office, and the parturients did not have to pay any expenses.

<p>— Jiaxi</p>
<p>— An Analysis of Shanghai Public Utilities (Part Two) —</p>
<p>Forty Years of Evolution</p>
<p>The current Shanghai Metropolitan Transportation Co., Ltd. evolved from the British-owned Tramway Company before the war. The British Tramway Company was founded in 1906. Initially, it was a Sino-British joint venture, but due to sluggish business and gradual losses, Chinese shareholders such as Zhu Lanfen proposed withdrawing their shares. Later, the company's former Taipan, Tao Lun, returned to London to appeal to the British financial community. With the loan assistance of the Participation Bank, all the shares owned by Chinese were bought back, and shares with a face value of ten yuan only returned one yuan. From then on, it was entirely operated by the British. At that time, the public was not enlightened, and citizens were superstitious and reluctant to ride the trams. After the British took over independent operation, they hired a group of unemployed vagrants, giving each person a set of blue short shirts and pants. They sat on the trams all day, with a daily meal allowance of three corners, and gifts such as cologne, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soaps were given to passengers. Only then did the public's doubts begin to subside, and the number of passengers increased daily. The first trams were the tracks of Route Eight and Route Seven, and then Route One and Route Two were added. Each route had six or seven trams running daily. Thereafter, business became increasingly prosperous, and more vehicles were purchased. By then, there were a total of 128 trams. In addition, 20 German Siemens trams were sold to Tianjin. Currently, less than 100 trams are in operation. There are two hundred trackless trams, but only about thirty are currently in operation. However, the daily operating income is higher than before, and the profit rate has exceeded pre-war levels by eight or nine thousand times.</p>
<p>The Tramway Company Under British Management</p>
<p>At that time, the main assets of the British Tramway Company were the aforementioned trams and trolleybuses. The old station at 80 Hed Road served as its base, and later a new station was established at the Huishan Wharf on Yangshupu Road. After the Second Battle of Shanghai, it was temporarily merged into the old station, but the management procedures remained independent. There was a tram repair shop on Baikai Road. Its internal organization was divided into the Vehicle Department, with drivers and ticket sellers as the backbone, occupying an extremely important position in terms of numbers and work. The second was the Engine Department. The common copper artisans were the most organized and powerful part of the tram company. This was entirely due to the greater opportunities for contact in terms of work relationships and working hours, unlike the dispersed organization of the Vehicle Department, where they could not see each other in the morning and evening, and there were frequent frictions between drivers and ticket sellers. At that time, the British supporters often used this contradiction to carry out provocative and divisive tactics, to achieve their goal of enslaving Chinese workers.</p>
<p>The administrative management system of the British Tramway Company, the highest position was the Taipan, or general manager. In the past, occupations in the tram company were generally considered to be a lucrative profession, and many sought opportunities, even paying a considerable price as a stepping stone to enter the company. Workers who were fired could also get their jobs back by paying money. Secondly, some old workers or staff members who had served in the company for many years should be given retirement benefits when they retired according to regulations. However, the British in charge of the company at that time often dismissed them on purpose, so that they would not receive half of their retirement benefits. However, according to insiders, it was still recorded as "retirement" in the company's reports, and the retirement benefits were paid in full. If these numbers were carefully calculated, they would be quite considerable, which shows the corruption of the British.</p>
<p>Analysis of the Cargo Nationality and Age of Employees</p>
<p>At present, the company has a total of nearly three thousand employees (excluding 120 foreigners in senior positions). The employees of the Vehicle Department account for the vast majority, followed by the Engine Department. In terms of job function, there are 1,200 ticket sellers, 600 drivers, 500 ticket inspectors, and more than 400 workers (including: wire pullers, road priers, coppersmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, electricians, sleeve adders, and wire repairers), and more than 200 laborers.</p>
<p>Most of these employees were differentiated from the countryside. In terms of origin, the Vehicle Department is mostly from northern Jiangsu, especially Yancheng. The next most common origins are Wuxi, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang. The Engine Department is mostly from Ningbo, accounting for about six-tenths, followed by local, Yangzhou, Wuxi, and Anhui, accounting for two-tenths, and the northern Jiangsu group accounting for two-tenths, mostly blacksmiths and laborers.</p>
<p>The most common age of workers is between thirty and forty, followed by those between twenty and thirty. There are more drivers over forty than ticket sellers. The age of employees in the Engine Department is also relatively old, which is entirely due to the need for skilled techniques in the above two types of work, making the turnover relatively small.</p>
<p>In terms of gender, the tram company has not yet found any female workers or staff members. However, in foreign countries, it is very common for women to work in transportation agencies. In Japan and the Soviet Union, women are very common in transportation agencies, and even drivers and coppersmiths also employ women.</p>
<p>Current Employee Treatment</p>
<p>Employee wages are calculated in three ways: hourly, daily, and monthly. Staff members are mostly paid monthly, drivers and ticket sellers are paid daily, and coppersmiths and laborers in the Engine Department are paid hourly. At the same time, wages vary, and even the wages for the same position vary depending on the length of service. Recently, the highest salary for ticket inspectors is 44,000 yuan. Ticket sellers and drivers can earn about 35,000 yuan per month, and ordinary workers only receive a little over 30,000 yuan per month. The last time fares increased by more than two times, wages also increased by 30%. After the tram fare increased by two borrows on May 1st, the rate of wage increase has not yet been announced. According to past practice, wage increases are not announced in advance, and one can only know when the salary is paid. The salary is paid twice a month, once on the 13th and once on the 27th. Each month, three dou of rice can be allocated, but there are more or less, and each dou costs more than 1,300 yuan.</p>
<p>The promotion of workers varies from department to department, and the same is not true for drivers and ticket sellers. Ticket sellers who work for 26 days in a month can get four days of promotion, and drivers who work for 26 days in a month can get three days of promotion. In reality, the so-called promotion means Sunday work. Most foreign enterprises take Sundays off, but tram workers cannot take holidays on Sundays, only in rotation. In principle, one day's wages should be given for each Sunday, but if drivers and ticket sellers only work 25 days or 25 and a half days in a month, there is no promotion, so workers completely lose their due rest days and wages every week. Sometimes, even if they have worked for 25 and a half days, the dispatcher stops the last half day of work, and promotion is naturally out of the question.</p>
<p>Workers do not receive wages for sick leave, and staff members used to receive their full salaries during sick leave, but this has now been cancelled. If a worker is injured on duty, wages can be paid as usual, but in the event of death, a small amount of compensation is given based on the number of years of service and the usual diligence of service. Those who die on duty can get one-twelfth of the compensation for their entire working time.</p>
<p>Retirement benefits are only paid to those who have served loyally and diligently for 15 years and are over 55 years of age, and who have been certified by a doctor as being old. The amount is one twenty-fourth of the entire working period, for example, those who have worked for 15 years can get seven and a half months of retirement benefits. Those who have worked for 20 years can get one-twelfth of the retirement benefits. However, there are often many employees who have served for more than 20 years who stop working due to various reasons, and receive no pension at all.</p>
