<h3>沖繩島周邊敵艦船　擊沉毀達十餘艘首里北方日軍使敵大出血</h3>
<p>琉球羣島基地二十二日中央社電　日軍特攻隊及航空部隊，十八日夜攻擊冲繩本島周邊之敵艦船，已查明擊沉擊毀敵空母等六艘，其後又查明於嘉手納西南海面擊沉驅逐艦一艘及小型艦二艘，於是十八日之戰果共計擊沉擊毀空母等十艘。又航空部隊及特攻隊二十日獲得戰果如次：二卞日下午八時，於伊江島南方海面擊沉擊毀運輸船各一艘，同時另一隊復擊沉擊毀運輸船各一艘，是日十一時半幷於那　海面，擊况輕巡洋艦一艘。</p>
<p>東二十二日中央社電　日航空部隊二十一日夜冒惡劣天氣，急襲硫黃島之敵軍機傷，投彈擊中元山機塲，六處發起大火，三處發生大爆炸。</p>
<p>琉球羣島基地二十二日中央社電　冲繩本島南部地區之戰况，其後無大變化，目九日至二十一日敵開始正式攻擊以來，仍於首里北方之運玉森·大名·安里方面，敵以戰車十餘輛强行前驅，企岡突破日軍陣地，敵於冲繩本島作戰，遭遇想像以上之出血。</p>
<h3>日東鄉外交　具有四特點　對華政策重在實行</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　關於東鄉外相兼大東亞相，於此次駐華大公使會議席上，再度闡明外交根本方針，社會人士莫不極爲重視。氏於外交官之經歷中，曾對蘇聯之折衝，獲得顯著成績，故一般對東鄉氏與對蘇外交直接相連緊，不爲無因。惟其後東鄉外相由何者著手進行，是爲注目之焦點·外相首先爲適應歐洲新情勢，宣布軸心條約失效，並廢棄防共協定，此爲東鄉外交新方針之第一步。其次則爲中國問題，對此，於二十一日之駐華大公使會議中，業已明顯訓示。有人謂東鄉外相向未駐任中國，對中國之施策如何，不無相當疑問，試一　其訓辭，則已知外相對中國問題，實懷有不平凡之識見，現將訓辭之範圍，試檢討之。東鄉外相對華政策之基本方針，第一，則謂對華政策，在於援助中國之統一獨立與自由，幷履行中日關係之平等與互惠，此與重光外交無何差異。同時所謂對華問題之重要性，亦如此次訓辭所謂「由戰爭指導之全盤觀之」爲一大特質，關於戰爭指導全盤者，因必須於戰爭最高指導會議討論，決定整個方針，此爲訓詞之第二特質。第三則爲克服所有障碍·緣東鄉外交與重光外交稍異者，即爲置重點於實行，此乃外交有識者一致美評之處也。爲實現計劃，必須克復一切障碍，爲不可或缺之前提。第四爲實現對華政策，乃爲打破困難之一大關鍵，由此可知東鄉外交之主要方針矣。</p>
<h3>泰拉干激戰　日堅守陣地</h3>
<p>西南太平洋基地二十二日中央社電　泰拉千戰綫自十六日以來，頓呈激烈，敵連日動員放火器來攻，但終不能突破日第一綫守備陣地，日方仍堅守飛機北方及油田地帶方面之陳地。敵迄今所制壓之地域，僅爲全島十分之一而已。敵方急於使用之飛機傷及油田地帶，因遭日軍之肉搏攻擊，不能施工，更不能使用。</p>
<h3>新島日軍急襲　使敵陷混亂</h3>
<p>南方甚地二十二日中央社電新幾內亞西北端之馬爾，自四月下旬以來，日守軍奮勇殺敵，五月四日及八·九兩日急襲敵軍營房，使敵陷於大混亂，現敵軍之一部已逃往雙子島，向奧爾馬來方面退出，雙子島之敵飛機塲似已開始使用，然活動機數極少。</p>
<h3>美威根承認對日作戰困難</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十二日中央社電　美戰時動員局長威根遜，十七日就美國於德國敗北後應取之戰時體制，向特魯曼提出報告如下：　打倒日本所需要時間甚長，預訓吾人尚未遭遇日本軍主力，日本艦隊尚有於陸上基地制空圈內，與美軍以痛烈之實力。且日本本土·朝鮮·及滿洲，儲有大量重要原料，其兵器儲藏量，今後最少能繼續抗戰一年。又封鎖日本與大陸間之連絡，甚感困難，故擬以飢餓戰略使之屈服亦屬難事。　今後一年中，須出動七百萬兵力，全美艦隊亦必須全部參加戰鬥，在歐洲之若干兵力應急速調至太平洋，然其性格及裝備，尚須加以訓練及改善。　爲補充兵員之損害，今後陸海軍應繼續徴兵，蓋歷來之太平洋戰爭，乃對日作戰之準備行動也。</p>
<h3>特魯曼　發出警告</h3>
<p>里期本二十二日中央社電據華盛頓訊：美總統特書曼於第十九次租借案議會席上，向衆作如下之警告，略謂：美國及正與日本作戰之聯合國，，前尚未遭遇日軍之總力目隨時隨地我等均須提防遇到在供應綫縮短上佔優勢之日有力部隊，我等需盡最大之力量，來與日太作戰。</p>
<h3>美國海軍當局　呼籲趕建空母</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　太平洋城之美機動部隊，因受日航空部隊之連續猛攻，逐次減少空襲。頃據華盛頓電稱，美海軍當局二十日呼籲全國造船所，傾注全力建造新空母，略謂太平洋戰爭愈接近日本之重要島嶼，則航空母艦所受損失愈大，蓋因敵軍基地空軍漸次增强，美國海軍現雖擁有世界最大之空母陣容，然造船業仍須舉全力建造新艦，目下正在趕緊建造者，務使早日完成。</p>
<h3>渝蔣與蘇大使　舉行懇談</h3>
<p>廣州二十二日中央社電據二十一日渝方廣播：蔣介石氏於二十日下午曾招宴新任蘇聯大使員特洛夫氏，與之懇談目前國際種種情况。</p>
<h3>渝美軍在貴陽新設航空基地</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電重慶電，在渝美軍司令部二十一日發表：於貴州省之貴陽，又新設一航空基地。</p>
<h3>新疆渝蘇軍　去年衝突眞相</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電據紐約電：去年九月以來，新疆省民衆與渝軍間之武力衝突，最近似已平戢。渝方當局對此事件退制消息外洩，故外間尚未得其傎相，惟因新疆與蘇聯有特殊關係，渝當局對於此事極爲重視。紐約時報頃以新疆省之紛爭爲題，陳述如次：新疆省自一九四三年十一月，情形即告不穩，至去年日益險惡。蘇軍於史太林格勒獲勝後數星期內，新疆省阿爾台地區即突然發生事件，當時與蘇聯已斷絕關係之省長盛世才，率孤軍三團及少數空軍彈壓，蘇聯雖未加反對，然外蒙古政府則謂盛世才空軍轟炸外蒙，提出嚴重抗議。一九四四年三月上旬，標有蘇聯標識之外蒙空軍飛機，對省內北部新張軍濫加轟炸，且不顧省方抗議，繼續轟炸十二日之久。該省現在之情形仍未見改善，蔣介石恐事態擴大，正竭力避免正面衝突，然延安方面對此幷未表示何種態度。</p>
<h3>蕪湖籌組福利委員會</h3>
<p>蕪湖二十二日中央社電此間地方公益事業，素乏完密之組織機構，當局有鑒及此，茲已計劃着手組織福利委會，今後統一辦理地方公益事業。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>新形勢的認識</h3>
<p>將近兩個月的冲繩島作戰，以敵美平均每分鐘死傷四人的程度，日見慘烈激化；而同時，英美與蘇聯之間，在舊金山會議中意見之紛歧，以及波闌問題與南斯拉夫事態之演進，又復矛盾　出。原來於歐戰結束以後，國際形勢之新發展即是如此！</p>
<p>歐戰結束以後，若干人爲爲日本既失去了歐洲的盟邦，而敵英美則可移調大軍至東亞方面，因而對於大東亞戰爭的前途將發生不利的影響。可是國際事情的變化却並不如此單純，前段所述不過聊舉一例而已，如果加以比較周密的考察，則在歐戰結束以後的國際新形勢，對於下列數點應予注意：</p>
<p>德義同國即已崩潰，作為蘇聯之敵的日本盟邦即告消失，因之日本得以立於新觀點而自由行動，宣佈廢止與德義兩國所訂的盟約與反共協定等，使維持中立的日蘇龢關係益見澄淸，這未始不是對於日本外交有利的事。</p>
<p>德國屈服以後，英美與蘇聯兩方不但消失了聯合的因素，且將正面發生對歐覇權之爭奪，如波蘭問題的僵持不下，南斯拉夫事態之跪起發生，即爲見於表面化的徼象。雖此種矛盾不致立即構成衝突，但可能演成英美與蘇聯間關係漸　惡化。</p>
<p>在近年來，波闌與巴爾幹各國均已入於隊聯的勢力範國，而北歐的芬闌興瑞典及西歐的法國與西班牙，左翼的勢力亦日見抬頭。如今蘇聯已自戰爭中解放出來，必將乘英美繼續作戰的機會，擴大樹植其政治力量。因此，英美不但為組　軸心國家之報復，且須為防止蘇聯的無限擴張，不得不留駐相當雄厚的實力於歐洲，換言之，英美軍隊在情勢上不免為蘇聯所牽制，因而未能移調其大部軍隊至東亞。這是今日英美最感頭痛的事。</p>
<p>據英美當局發表，在此次歐戰中，美軍人員損失九十五萬以上，英軍人員損失達一百十二萬以上；至於物資消耗之鉅，更是可想而知。如今英美軍還得慘烈犧牲下去，其結果徒予蘇聯以休義整備以至擴張的機會，這已在英美國內引起了不滿的情緒。爲了避免長期的犧牲，英美急欲結束戰爭，但若藉軍事方式以求解決，則其作戰愈深入，其犧牲亦就愈增　，這又是英美當前所遇的困難。</p>
<p>在東亞作戰方面敵英美的繼續消耗，是對於蘇聯有利的；尤其在歐洲政治問題尚未解決期間，亦即央美與蘇聯間的矛盾繼續成長期間，蘇聯必將站在東亞戰局之外，以便壓迫英美讓步。茲假定蘇聯採取不幹涉的態度，英美繼能調動較日本為優勢的軍力作戰，則在愈深入即愈犧牲的必然情勢下，足使作戰兩方軍力的對比，由英美的優勢而變成平衡，而再變爲日本的優勢之可能。再假定英美與蘇聯間的矛盾始終不獲妥協，而且日益增多擴大的話，則或將促成整個亞洲的大團結以共同抵抗英美的戰爭。</p>
<p>在此，我們應當考慮到，當此戰局已臨決定關頭的時候，我們中國營　怎樣的態度呢？誰都知道，英美不但是對我實行帝國主義侵略的前鋒，並且更對我黃種人存着根深蒂固的歧視；因此我們必須掃除英美的侵略，粉碎他們的種族的優越感，如此方能造成國際間的平等與友善。如今日本既以平等互惠待我，則中日兩國實應趕速完成全面的和平合作，加强力量，以共同擊滅英美制　東亞的野心。這次世界大戰因中日事變而起，亦將隨中日和平而終，這是我人所當深切反省的。</p>

<h3>令各縣驅蝗</h3>
<p>蘇州二十二日中央社電　本有農業增產策進委員會，以鎮江縣發現姚　，若不及早　減，勢必　延成災，影響增產至為可慮，茲聞該會昨已令各縣，應即遵全省頒治蝗辦法協力防除。</p>
<p>北平二十二日中央社電　燕京道各縣合作社，為完成本年食糧增產，保護植物健全生長起見，特聯合農民熱烈展開滅蝗運動，並分別組成調查班，從事調查工作。</p>
<h3>法術無靈　邪教首領遭擊斃</h3>
<p>無錫二十二日中央社電無錫自發現先天道匪後，迭經中日當局勸諭，苦口婆心，仁至義盡，但始終不覺悟，內部意見亦紛歧。近又發現所謂金光法者，由姜旬波主持，自稱華北先天道派，來入道者須砍八十一刀，刀刀不入，　動鄉兵，入會者有數萬各，民衆均被洣惑。當局派人勸　停止活動，姜某不知歛跡，自願來城試驗，本月十八日姜率徒數十人，在北郊先行作法，告神念咒，然後於距離三百公尺處，將姜及徒衆全數擊斃，觀衆數萬人咸鼓堂稱快，並深信邪敎之不可恃信。</p>
<h3>法國施高壓政策　近東情勢嚴重　阿聯盟干涉黎法糾紛</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十二日中央社電據倫敦公報稱：阿拉伯聯盟現對近東國與法國間之糾紛，已正式作首次之干涉措置，該聯盟中之總參謀長阿森貝伊，曾發表一擁護叙利亞與黎巴嫩之談話，略謂，世界回敎徒之輿論，均贊助叙黎兩國目前之舉動，我阿刺伯聯盟右有必要時，必將於舊金山會犧結束後召開阿刺伯會議。渠續稱，天下回敎界所一致擁戴之阿刺伯國，將永站於「自由目主」之地位。</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日由央社電據英國駐開羅特派訪員報告稱：雖有阿拉伯聯盟現積極舉行會議，討論解決近東問題，然法國與近東各國間之情勢更形緊張，據昨日回返開羅之旅行隊談稱，在大馬色·貝魯特等地，於日前均有示威舉動，擁護叙利亞與黎巴嫩政府所採强硬態度，尤以該地束部一帶，並有女子之示威行動。在大馬色發生一小流血暴動，十七人受傷，衆信該項情勢之急轉危點，實由於法國與近東各國政府間舉行會談時，突增强該地之法駐軍所致。黎巴嫩政府曾向四大强國提出抗議，法國不應未得黎政府之同意，竟遺派生力軍在該地强行登陸，然法方侵入該地，以　戰略，　經濟，（根據授予法國經濟優先權之協定），　文化三項之發展爲理由。</p>
<p>黎敘強硬覆法要求</p>
<p>法國民衆感覺感覺英國應支持法政府之要求，蓋英國本身已在埃及。伊拉克等地享有特殊地位，但英當局及將卡特洛克斯所提呈之近東國家自由獨立宣言批准，有意支持黎巴嫩等國所提出之建議。目前黎巴嫩叙利亞兩國對於答覆法國要求，意見已趨一致，該項覆書內容略謂，　彼等在法方採用武力手段時，將決不與法方舉行會談，　法國所提出之建議，實欲搗毀彼等之自由獨立，　彼等將決不對法國予以較英美更大之優越地位。</p>
<p>歐戰餘　波及近東</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　因托里埃斯特問題，南斯拉夫蒂托政府與英美間發生糾紛日益激烈之際，歐戰之餘燼又波及近東，致使叙利亞·黎已嫩·伊拉克地方阿拉伯人，與法國之間發生磨擦。叙利亞與黎巴嫩雖於一九四一年九月十六日脫離法國覊絆，宣告爲獨立共和國，然仍有法軍駐於國內。今法國藉口調防，派新兵至黎巴嫩，且其兵力更超過原來數量，同時又派多數法人將校潛入該地，從事秘密活動，致黎巴嫩種表不滿，採取抗法態度，然其抗爭甚為消極。</p>
<p>伊拉克對法抗議</p>
<p>伊拉克突於二十日正式對法國提出抗議，責難法兵不應於黎巴漱登陸，同時並對近東諸國提出二案：　爲抵抗法國此種强壓行動，阿拉伯各國須結成共同戰綫，　爲粉碎法國所取之弱國强食政策，樹立國際正義起見，須向舊金山會議提出該問題，以求公平處理，呼籲阿拉伯族大同國結對法抗爭。此問題之前途如何，殊値重視。</p>
<p>敘境發生流血衝突</p>

<h3>迎第四十次海軍紀念日</h3>
<p>— 中國方面艦報道部長松島大佐</p>
<p>第一　緒言</p>
<p>我人茲於最熾烈之決戰階段，迎第四十次海軍紀念日·過去四十年間日本海軍所發揮之武力戰績，以及於本屆聖戰中奮鬥力戰，仰賴聲威，迭樹功績，對於各先輩及戰役英靈之偉勛，實表無線之敬意，此為現下感激最深者之一。大東亞戰爭已進入真正之深刻決戰階段，彼我以冲繩島爲中戰略態勢，實爲今後戰爭推移之一大關鍵。同時歐洲方面情勢，又迅速給與太平洋戰局以影響，此際我人惟有加緊團結一萬萬同胞之特工精神，迅速推進摧毀驕敵之完善態勢。茲分類設明如下：</p>
<p>第二　太平洋決戰現階段</p>
<p>敵自本年三月中旬攻取硫黃島以來，更以攻路日本本島之重要據點冲繩島為目標，先以機動部隊機我九州·四國·瀨戶內海方面，欲截斷日本航空機至本源，並遮斷日本本土與沖繩之聯絡，求沖繩之速決。此種作戰由太平洋戰局之推移言，或徴諸敵首腦部屢次宣明，乃可預料及之者·蓋敵人正照預定計劃，力謀獲得包圍日本本土之基地，照敵人於攻擊硫黃島之際，出乎意料之外，遭受猛烈打擊，兵員損害，極爲慘重，故於冲繩島攻戰時，異常審愼，準備亦似十分充分。彼於尼米茲總指揮官之下，築中全部太平洋艦隊，並准許過去格格不相容之英國艦加入同一作戰，編成英美共同作戰部隊，集艦隊千四百艘，陸上兵力六師，企圖一舉攻陷冲繩島。敵之作戰行動，以三月十八十九兩日之敵機動部隊來襲南九州方面開始，但敵在該方面蒙受重大損害，一時乃收集其機動部隊，向東南方面避退，不久更由後方獲得新銳部隊增援彌補第一綫機動部隊之缺額。復於三月二十三日以來，對冲繩島方面施行猛烈空襲。二十七日於該島西方之慶良間列島登陸，企圖使用爲攻略冲島之重要基地。此後對冲繩島施行猛烈砲擊轟炸，終於四月一日以約三師兵力，在該島西方北谷附近登陸，於是戰局徒形緊張。</p>
<p>再觀我方防衛陣之態勢，一面於冲繩方面集結精銳之陸海軍部隊，依照過去之作戰經騐，構築極完備之陣地，以封閉敵陸海空三方面之來襲。同時由日本本土及其他基地派遣强力航空部隊及水上部隊，佈就一舉殲滅來寇冲繩方面之敵水陸兩用部隊之勢·美軍始認爲作戰之推移極易，此後遂次增加兵力，終至四月上旬已出動陸軍三師，海軍二師，約十萬兵力，將冲繩北部及中部飛機塲佔領後，即進抵南方，欲奪取以首里那覇作中心之日軍重要據點及航空基地，進迫所謂南部戰綫。又以一部兵力於四月七日在冲繩西北部名護町附近登陸，更在其西方據點之伊江島登陸，一面又鞏固艦隊之泊地中城灣泊地，於是日美兩軍之决戰，漸呈熾烈。</p>
<p>當時日陸海軍部隊於敵登陸時，憑險固守，旋以時機來臨，於四月六日開始陸海空三方面之第一期總攻擊，十二日展開第二次，十六日展開第三次攻擊等壯舉。此數日雖氣候惡劣，但日軍仍以全身特攻殺到敵兵力之屯集點，予以重創。迄至四月十八日，已樹立擊沉擊毀敵艦艇三百九十三　之記錄。更迄五月二日，增加至擊沉或擊毀敵艦艇五百二十餘艘之多。按日軍之此種攻擊，當然旨在擊潰敵機動部隊之主力，次爲對於直接支援登陸作戰之敵戰艦，巡洋艦隊等艦船，輸送船團及陸上基地之敵航空兵力，施行集中的攻擊，而上述日軍之戰果，大部均係敵航空母艦，戰艦，巡洋艦等，幾全屬敵戰鬥部隊之中樞，因此敵蒙受預料以外治重大打擊。　四月二十日，敵直大部機動部隊，因受損過重，而向後方遠　，僅留一部特設航空母艦部隊擔當彼此間之連絡。又於三十日左右接近冲繩東方面之敵正式航空母艦三艘，特設航空母艦二艘左右爲基幹之敵艦二隊編成之機動部隊，其後運遭日軍之猛攻，亦於五月七日左右遠　無踪，致敵機動部隊之作戰支持力發生大頓挫。但敵於此時屢由馬里亞納方面集合B29型，硫磺島方面P51型等空軍，實施破壞九州方面之日方基地，切斷日本土及沖繩島間之連絡，反復施行連續數次之遠距敵空襲。陸上方面之敵兵力，計有陸軍第十軍四師，及海軍第一第六兩師，約十萬兵力，從四月十六日左右開始猛烈攻擊，專欲進接南方戰綫，直指西海岸之那　，中部之首里，東岸之與那原方面，於大隊坦克車，空軍及海面艦砲射擊之支援下，　續猛烈之攻勢。敵迭次表明此次冲繩戰綫實爲太平洋作戰中空前之劇戰，對於日軍陣地之巧妙整頓，據守固若金湯之日軍威力，及日軍重砲之極大效果，屢次贊歎。其前綫敵部險亦因酣戰過勞，終於四月杪敵陸軍中央部隊之第九十六師團，似已蒙受鉅創，不得不調遣北方作戰中之海軍第一師及陸軍第七十七師參加該方面戰塲，敵之苦戰由是可見。</p>
<p>又敵軍上級幹部，對於日航空部隊之特攻精神，初則力守械默，至是已不克再事掩飾，終使敵將尼米茲亦坦白承認對於日神風特攻擊之來攻，雖任何艦艇亦不能完全防禦，故一經命中，難免發生任何損害。又美軍自已統計所蒙之損害，迄四月二十七日止之損害，計死傷及行踪不明者一萬一千四百七各。此項雖係從輕發長，由此可見一斑。</p>
<p>又關於與美軍共同作戰之英國機動部隊之行動，發表稱，英機動部隊於四月六日左右攻擊先島羣島時，其主力艦喬治五世號曾蒙破創外，並無詳細發表，由此可以推定約擁有戰艦二艘，航空母艦四艘之英艦隊行動，極爲不振。故五月上旬以冲繩島作中心之日美兩軍戰略態勢，絕對於日方有利。敵登陸部隊因受日軍不斷猛攻，敵海上部隊則受日軍之速續猛攻，已被逐次擊滅，或被迫後退，冲繩四周之敵艦艇數目亦激減，至五月七日左右，約擁有以戰艦五艘作中心，巡洋艦十艘左右，驅逐艦約三十艘，輸送艦約六十艘而巳。</p>
<p>在此種情勢下使戰局進展，日軍顯已絕對掌握戰勝之神機，前綫之强弱，端賴後方補給之情形如何，敵痛感於橫斷廣表四千浬之太平洋極伏危機，及距離之擴大，日方則已利用此時機，俾一舉挽回戰局。</p>
<p>第三　太平洋及印度洋方面之作戰概況</p>
<p>北太平洋方面敵軍已久無行動，但隨該方面氣候之趨溫暖，預料敵對日本之千島方面將有何種窺伺，果至二月十九日敵出動一部飛機及艦艇來襲，占守島及幌筵島方面，當遭日駐軍擊退，其後戰局未有發展，該方面從敵所宣傳之包圍日本本土作戰上觀，美國極予注意。但因現在太平洋作戰之焦點，集中於冲繩島，故對該方面不能作大規模之攻擊，此僅爲一部牽制的行動而已。</p>
<p>其次菲律賓方面敵軍已逐漸佔據日軍據點，刻由呂宋島方面之碧瑤，加葛耶平原地帶展開陸戰，於南部之民大諾方面，以納卯作中心激戰極烈，敵於四月杪出動美英澳荷之聯合部隊來攻婆羅洲東海岸之塔拉干島，刻於該方面展開激戰。又由新幾內亞島北岸，新布列顧島及布根維爾島之日本內南洋全綫，敵所施行掃萬作戰，於各地展開局地戰鬥。日軍於炎熱瘴癘之鄉勇戰奮鬥，堅守孤立無援之各地點，於各地區痛擊敵軍。他如於薩班島，迭尼安島，關島及硫礦島之日軍殘存部隊，仍在展開遊擊戰，使敵軍心驚胆慄，且爲大東亞民族吐萬丈氣燄。我等對於此等神人合一之將兵，表示衷心之感謝。</p>
<p>第四　印度洋方面之戰況</p>
<p>緬甸戰錢之英印及渝軍約二十師兵力，逐漸由北方山獄地帶，接近日軍之堅陣，日軍由瓦城，　　撤退以後，戰局重新展開局面。四月中下旬以來於茂克脫拉方面尚繼續展開激鬥。又英印第十四軍循緬甸鐵路綫，利用伊拉瓦底河之水運南下，與接近海岸進擊之第十五軍步調一致，圖克服仰光附近，刻似在仰光地區激戰中。此時印度洋艦隊忽然出現，於四月二十七日向婆羅洲島北岸及西岸發砲轟擊。又出戰一部兵力來攻尼哥巴島方面，皆在牽制進攻仰光作戰，此後敵軍之進攻該方面，將日形積極，敵來攻仰光之機會，整頓海陸空三方而部隊，如有機可乘，或將向馬來半島及蘇門答諸方面出動作戰。</p>
<p>第五　歐洲戰局終幕與太平洋作戰</p>
<p>歐洲戰局於今年春間，德軍陡呈不利狀態，東綫之蘇聯軍及西綫之英美加法聯合軍進展極速，終於五月二日蘇軍一舉攻入柏林，德軍犧牲極衆，德元首希特勒及郭培爾宣傳部長，季合爾將軍將領奮戰陣歿。歐洲戰綫乃呈大混亂狀態。此時德新任總統社尼資將軍繼承希特勒元首之遺志，奮起救國。又約二十萬德軍據守捷克斯洛伐克西南國境地帶堅陣綱續最後抗戰，但各方面德軍因給養困難與長期苦戰，已疲憊不堪而向敵軍投降，至是歐洲戰局遂即迅速終幕。據五月七日愛森霍華將軍司令部發表稱，德方代表曾於是日實行無條件投降之簽字云。</p>
<p>又義大利之大部份國土，全已落入英美軍手中，奮戰至最後之墨索里尼首相，亦於四月二十八日在米闌附近與其幕僚同遭逮捕，被叛黨處以極刑。北部義大利及南奧之德軍，亦向敵軍投降，戰局乃全入反軸心軍之堂握·惟我人觀於英美蘇之複雜關係，及歐洲之政治的與戰略的態勢之機　關係。使在歐美軍不能迅速調在太平洋方面。雖然，敵美軍此後將迅速向太平洋方面補充兵力，期可一舉結束太平洋戰局，故我人巳抱有絕大決心，對於來寇太平洋之美軍及在中國大陸方面圖行反攻之渝軍暨美英軍，有予以極大警戒之必要。</p>
<p>第六　結論</p>
<p>要之，世界戰局刻已急轉直下，日本已喪失德義兩同盟國，而迎擊美英勢力於太平洋上以一決雌雄，其勝敗之運命，已加幾百倍之重大性。日本在此時際，毅然奉戴聖訓，以殲滅驕敵美英，於一億國民特攻總擊之大旗下，已臨以血及正義誇示萬邦之毀會，敵軍雖强大，但日軍尚握有重要之戰略及有利之態勢，與一億特攻之烈烈鬥魂，我等肩荷皇國不磨之團體，堅特昭昭之一大精神，同時當局對外採取適切之措置，必然戰局有利於日本，爲我等所確信者也。</p>
<p>茲於此熾烈之決戰下，迎第十屆日海軍紀念日，回憶我等先輩當時奮戰力鬥之精神，深信此後四十年間日本海軍百折不撓之努力厥在今日，我等應更加努力，務以建立永遠不朽深銘歷史之東亞民族金字塔，皇祖皇宗之神靈在上，幾萬戰歿之英靈在天空翱翔，斷然所向，鬼神爲避，我軍隊雖千萬人亦斷然勇往邁進也。</p>

<h3>與蘇省當局接洽　農貸實施問題　諮詢委員陳彬龢氏仰泳赴蘇經過</h3>
<p>上海市諮詢委員會提議舉辦蘇省產米區農貸一事，已於本月二十日成立農貸銀團，惟有若干實施問題，須與蘇省府當局面洽，爰由諮詢會推派陳委員彬龢前往蘇州與任省長商洽，於昨日早車赴蘇，當日下午返滬，中央社記者當即訪謁陳氏，叩詢接洽經過，承告如次：</p>
<p>任省長從去年十一月到任以來，對於省政頗多革新。木人原　雖爲蘇州，但已十餘年未回故鄉，久欲返蘇觀光，適此次因農貸一事，有與省當局接洽一切之必要，奉諮詢會李主席委員思浩之命，專程赴蘇，訪晤任省長，談話結果，歸納如次：</p>
<p>滬市與蘇省間具有唇齒關係</p>
<p>蘇省當局對於安定民生與農業增產，原爲施政重點之一。去年省府實施田賦征收實物　市舉辦農貸工作，正與省政重點相符，表示極端歡迎。蘇滬在地域經濟各方面均有屛齒關係，田於今次之農貸成功，更可促進密切關係。因此省當局對於周市長羅秘書長，暨工商界領袖，尤其金融界領袖之關切與協力，表示欽佩與感謝。</p>
<p>省府組委同會準備實施方案</p>
<p>省府方面接受農貸建議後，對於實際處理方面頗為鄭重。並於接到上海市舉辦農貸消息後，推由財顧裴廳長，建設廳孫廳長，暨聯絡部金子部長，於五月十六日專程來，滬與各方面數度商討。現由省府組織農貸委員會專責辦理，任省長自任主任委員，準備一切實施方案，聯絡部長金子大作暨該部諸專家均熱烈協助。</p>
<p>農耕轉瞬即屆希望從速集款</p>
<p>月前農耕之期轉瞬即屆，蘇省希望於六月初旬籌足農貸五十億元全部款項，以便實施貸放計劃。發集款遲延，誠恐事倍功半。農貸對象以農民直接受惠為主，防止中間人操縱剝削。</p>
<p>選款購米運滬省府全力促成</p>
<p>蘇省當局對於滬市民食，極為關心，在周市長就任之初，即表示願為協力。此次舉辦農貸，將來就償還本息由米糧統制機關採購食米運滬，關節民食，省府自當極力協助，全力促成。（任省長　至協助滬市民食問題時，表示極端負靑與肯定之態度。）</p>
<p>任省長爲對本市市政當局暨各界之協力，表示答謝起見，將於最　期內親自來滬一行。</p>
<p>又本人去蘇時，曾特有諮詢會李主席委員致蘇省任省長公兩，茲連同蘇省當局復函一倂抄錄於后：</p>
<p>諮詢會致蘇省府公函</p>
<p>逕啓者：本會同人鑒於滬市民食問題，與江蘇省產米區之食糧增產，具有密切關係，滬市民食問題之解決，有賴於蘇省產米區之食糧增產，而期待食糧增產，必先解除農民經濟上之痛苦。本此意義，因有舉辦蘇省產米區農村貸款之建議，經於四月十六日第十四次委員會議通過，設置小組委員會，負責推動。業經三度商討，決定組織農貸銀團委員會，推定委員九人，互推思浩爲主任委員，負資農貸總數五十萬萬元之募集。更鑒於目前農耕地屆，農民需款孔殷，勉力於最短期內實施貸放，並為與貴省府取得密切合作，實施貸放工作，委請貴省府全權辦理。惟為切實裨助滬市民食起見，至新穀登塲時，如何運用農貸還款本息，採辨食糧運滬　節民食，尤須仰仗貴省府惠允協助辦理。相應備函牽達，即希查照見覆為荷。此致江蘇省政府任省長。上海特別市諮詢委員會當務委員會主席委員李思浩。（五月二十一日）</p>
<p>蘇省府復諮詢會公函</p>
<p>敬復者；接奉台函，拜悉一一。此次滬市舉辦農貸，協力蘇省農業增產，不勝心感。將來運用農貸本息，經由米糧統制機關爲滬市採購食米，以資調節，囑由蘇省府協助一節，蘇省府自必以全力促成其事，以副貴諸詢委員會爲滬市綢繆之雅意。此覆上海特別市諮詢委員會李主席。江蘇省政府省長任援道。（五月廿二日）</p>
<p>談至此，對於農　問題告一段落。陳氏復謂與任省並談及蘇省建設問題，極願轉告記者，惟以時間已久，允於明日約談。</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships Around Okinawa Sunk and Destroyed: Over Ten Vessels. Japanese Forces North of Shuri Inflict Heavy Casualties on the Enemy</h3>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Special Attack Units and Air Forces attacked enemy warships around Okinawa Island on the night of the 18th. It has been confirmed that six enemy aircraft carriers and other vessels were sunk or destroyed. Subsequently, it was also confirmed that a destroyer and two small warships were sunk in the sea southwest of Kadena. Therefore, the total results of the battle on the 18th amounted to the sinking or destruction of ten vessels, including aircraft carriers. Furthermore, the air force and special attack units achieved the following results on the 20th: At 8:00 PM on the 20th, one transport ship each was sunk and destroyed south of Ie Island. At the same time, another unit sunk and destroyed one transport ship each. At 11:30 PM on the same day, one light cruiser was damaged on the sea there.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese air force units braved adverse weather conditions on the night of the 21st to launch a surprise attack on enemy aircraft at Iwo Jima. Bombs hit the Motoyama airfield, causing large fires in six locations and major explosions in three.</p>
<p>Ryukyu Islands Base, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - There have been no major changes in the war situation in the southern Okinawa Island area. Since the enemy's formal offensive began on the 9th through the 21st, they have continued to use over ten tanks to forcibly advance north of Shuri in the Unadama Forest, Ona, and Asato areas, attempting to break through Japanese defenses. The enemy is encountering heavier-than-expected casualties in the Okinawa Island campaign.</p>
<h3>Tōgō Diplomacy: Four Key Characteristics. Emphasis on Implementation in China Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Tōgō's repeated clarification of fundamental diplomatic policies at the recent conference of ambassadors to China has drawn significant attention from the public. His past experience in negotiations with the Soviet Union has yielded remarkable results, hence the widespread association of Tōgō with diplomacy towards the Soviet Union is not without cause. However, the subsequent steps Tōgō will take are a key focus. The first step of Tōgō's new diplomatic policy was to adapt to the new European situation by announcing the invalidation of the Axis Pact and the abolition of the Anti-Comintern Pact. The next issue is the China problem, which was clearly instructed at the conference of ambassadors to China on the 21st. Some people have questioned Tōgō's policies towards China due to his lack of prior postings there. However, a review of his instructions reveals that he holds extraordinary insight into the China issue. Let us now examine the scope of his instructions. The fundamental principles of Tōgō's China policy are: Firstly, to assist China's unification, independence, and freedom, and to implement equality and mutual benefit in Sino-Japanese relations. This is no different from Shigemitsu's diplomacy. At the same time, the importance of the China problem is characterized by this instruction as "viewed from the overall perspective of war guidance," which is a major characteristic. Regarding the overall aspect of war guidance, it must be discussed at the Supreme War Guidance Conference to determine the overall policy, which is the second characteristic of the instruction. The third is to overcome all obstacles. The slight difference between Tōgō's diplomacy and Shigemitsu's diplomacy lies in its emphasis on implementation, which is consistently praised by knowledgeable figures in diplomacy. To realize the plan, overcoming all obstacles is an indispensable prerequisite. The fourth is that realizing the China policy is a major key to breaking through difficulties. From this, we can understand the main direction of Tōgō's diplomacy.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Tarakan: Japanese Forces Firmly Defend Positions</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Tarakan front has become fierce since the 16th. The enemy has been mobilizing flamethrowers to attack daily, but ultimately cannot break through the Japanese front-line defensive positions. Japanese forces are still firmly defending their positions in the northern area of the airfield and the oil field areas. The area occupied by the enemy so far is only one-tenth of the entire island. The enemy is eager to use the airfield and the oil field areas, but due to close-quarters attacks by Japanese forces, construction is impossible and use is even more so.</p>
<h3>Surprise Attack by Japanese Forces on New Guinea Island Throws Enemy into Confusion</h3>
<p>Southern Region, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - At Madang, the northwestern tip of New Guinea, Japanese troops have been bravely fighting the enemy since late April. On May 4th, 8th, and 9th, they launched surprise attacks on enemy barracks, throwing the enemy into great confusion. A portion of the enemy forces has already fled to the Twin Islands and is retreating towards the Oma area. The enemy airfield on the Twin Islands seems to have begun operations, but the number of active aircraft is extremely small.</p>
<h3>American Wixon Admits Difficulties in War Against Japan</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - American War Mobilization Director Wixon submitted the following report to Truman on the 17th regarding the wartime system the United States should adopt after Germany's defeat: It will take a very long time to defeat Japan. We are forewarned that we have not yet encountered the main force of the Japanese army. The Japanese fleet still possesses the strength to inflict severe blows on the U.S. military within the air defense zone of its land bases. Furthermore, the Japanese mainland, Korea, and Manchuria have large reserves of important raw materials, and their arms reserves will be able to continue resisting for at least another year. Moreover, blockading the connection between Japan and the mainland is very difficult, so the starvation strategy to force surrender is also difficult. In the next year, seven million troops must be mobilized, and the entire U.S. fleet must also participate in the battle. Some troops in Europe should be rapidly transferred to the Pacific, but their nature and equipment still need to be trained and improved. To replenish troop losses, the army and navy should continue conscription, as the Pacific War so far has been a preparatory action for the war against Japan.</p>
<h3>Truman Issues a Warning</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Washington dispatch, President Truman issued the following warning to the House of Representatives during the 19th Lend-Lease Act session, stating in brief: The United States and the Allied nations currently fighting Japan have not yet encountered the full strength of the Japanese army. We must be vigilant at all times and in all places against powerful Japanese units that have an advantage in shortening supply lines. We need to do our best to fight Japan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Authorities Call for Accelerated Aircraft Carrier Construction</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The U.S. mobile force in the Pacific region is gradually reducing air strikes due to continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese air force. According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy authorities called on shipyards across the nation on the 20th to dedicate their full efforts to building new aircraft carriers, stating in brief: As the Pacific War gets closer to Japan's important islands, the losses suffered by aircraft carriers become greater, because enemy base air forces are gradually increasing in strength. Although the U.S. Navy currently possesses the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, the shipbuilding industry must still devote all its efforts to building new ships, and those currently under construction must be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek and Soviet Ambassador Hold Cordial Talks in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a broadcast from Chongqing on the 21st: Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet on the afternoon of the 20th for the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador, Mr. Petrov, and cordially discussed the current international situation with him.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Establishes New Air Base in Guiyang, Chongqing</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - A Chongqing dispatch states that the U.S. military headquarters in Chongqing announced on the 21st: Another new air base has been established in Guiyang, Guizhou Province.</p>
<h3>The Truth Behind the Conflict Between Xinjiang Locals and Chongqing-Soviet Troops Last Year</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a New York dispatch: The armed conflict between the people of Xinjiang Province and the Chongqing army since September of last year seems to have subsided recently. The Chongqing authorities have restricted the leakage of information about this incident, so outsiders have not yet obtained the truth. However, because Xinjiang has a special relationship with the Soviet Union, the Chongqing authorities attach great importance to this matter. The New York Times recently published an article titled "The Conflict in Xinjiang Province," stating the following: The situation in Xinjiang Province has been unstable since November 1943, and it has become increasingly dangerous last year. A sudden incident occurred in the Altai region of Xinjiang Province within a few weeks after the Soviet victory in Stalingrad. At that time, Governor Sheng Shicai, who had severed relations with the Soviet Union, led three isolated regiments and a small number of air force units to suppress the incident. Although the Soviet Union did not oppose it, the Mongolian government claimed that Sheng Shicai's air force had bombed Outer Mongolia and lodged a serious protest. In early March 1944, aircraft of the Outer Mongolian air force marked with Soviet symbols indiscriminately bombed Xin Zhangjun in the northern part of the province, and continued bombing for twelve days despite the province's protest. The situation in the province has not improved. Chiang Kai-shek is trying his best to avoid a head-on conflict in order to prevent the situation from escalating, but Yenan has not expressed any attitude towards this.</p>
<h3>Wuhu to Establish Welfare Committee</h3>
<p>Wuhu, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Local public welfare undertakings here have always lacked a complete organizational structure. In view of this, the authorities have planned to start organizing a welfare committee, which will uniformly handle local public welfare undertakings in the future.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Understanding the New Situation</h3>
<p>The nearly two-month-long Okinawa Island campaign is becoming increasingly tragic and intense, with the enemy, the Americans, suffering an average of four casualties per minute. At the same time, the differences of opinion between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union at the San Francisco Conference, as well as the evolution of the Polish problem and the situation in Yugoslavia, are once again revealing contradictions. It turns out that the new development of the international situation after the end of the European War is like this!</p>
<p>After the end of the European War, some people believed that since Japan had lost its European allies, and the enemy, Britain and the United States, could transfer large armies to the East Asian front, the prospects for the Greater East Asia War would be adversely affected. However, the changes in international affairs are not so simple. The aforementioned is just one example. If we conduct a more thorough investigation, we should pay attention to the following points regarding the new international situation after the end of the European War:</p>
<p>The collapse of Germany and Italy means that Japan's allies, who were enemies of the Soviet Union, have disappeared. Therefore, Japan can stand from a new perspective and act freely, announcing the abolition of the treaties and anti-communist agreements signed with Germany and Italy, making the neutral relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union clearer. This may not be a disadvantage for Japanese diplomacy.</p>
<p>After Germany's surrender, Britain and the United States not only lost the uniting factor, but will also face a struggle for hegemony in Europe. The stalemate of the Polish problem and the rise of the Yugoslav situation are manifestations of this. Although these contradictions are unlikely to immediately constitute a conflict, they may evolve into a gradual deterioration of relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In recent years, Poland and the Balkan countries have all entered the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, and the power of the left wing in the Nordic countries of Finland and Sweden, and in the Western European countries of France and Spain, is also rising daily. Now that the Soviet Union has been liberated from the war, it will inevitably take advantage of the opportunity of Britain and the United States continuing to fight to expand and establish its political power. Therefore, Britain and the United States not only need to retaliate against the Axis countries, but also need to prevent the unlimited expansion of the Soviet Union, and have no choice but to maintain a considerable strength in Europe. In other words, British and American troops are inevitably constrained by the Soviet Union in terms of the situation, and therefore cannot transfer most of their troops to East Asia. This is the most troubling thing for Britain and the United States today.</p>
<p>According to British and American authorities, in this European War, the United States suffered more than 950,000 personnel losses, and the British army suffered more than 1.12 million personnel losses. As for the massive consumption of materials, it is even more conceivable. Now that the British and American forces have to continue to sacrifice tragically, the result is only to give the Soviet Union the opportunity to rest, reorganize, and expand, which has aroused dissatisfaction in the United States and Britain. In order to avoid long-term sacrifices, Britain and the United States are eager to end the war, but if they seek a solution through military means, the deeper they go into the war, the more their sacrifices will increase. This is another difficulty that Britain and the United States are currently facing.</p>
<p>The continued consumption of the enemy, Britain and the United States, in the East Asian theater is beneficial to the Soviet Union; especially during the period when the European political problem has not been resolved, that is, the period when the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union continue to grow, the Soviet Union will inevitably stand outside the East Asian war situation in order to pressure the United States and Britain to make concessions. Assuming that the Soviet Union adopts a non-interventionist attitude, and the United States and Britain can continue to mobilize military forces that are superior to Japan's to fight, then under the inevitable situation of deeper invasion leading to greater sacrifice, it is sufficient to make the comparison of military strength between the two sides change from the superiority of Britain and the United States to a balance, and then to the possibility of becoming Japan's superiority. Furthermore, assuming that the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are never reconciled and continue to increase and expand, it may promote the great unity of the entire Asia to jointly resist the war waged by Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Here, we should consider what attitude we Chinese should take when the war situation has reached a decisive moment? Everyone knows that Britain and the United States are not only the vanguard of imperialist aggression against us, but also harbor deep-rooted discrimination against us yellow people; therefore, we must eliminate the aggression of Britain and the United States and shatter their sense of racial superiority, so as to create equality and friendship among nations. Now that Japan treats us with equality and mutual benefit, China and Japan should quickly complete full peace and cooperation, strengthen their forces, and jointly destroy Britain and the United States' ambition to dominate East Asia. This world war started because of the Sino-Japanese Incident and will also end with Sino-Japanese peace. This is what we should deeply reflect on.</p>

<h3>Order Each County to Drive Away Locusts</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Agricultural Production Promotion Committee of this city has learned that locusts have been found in Zhenjiang County. If the reduction is not completed soon, the disaster is inevitable, which will affect the increase in production. It is heard that the committee yesterday ordered all counties to cooperate in preventing and eliminating locusts in accordance with the provincial measures for governing locusts.</p>
<p>Beiping, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to complete this year's food production increase and protect the healthy growth of plants, the cooperatives of each county in Yanjing Road, together with farmers, enthusiastically launched a locust eradication campaign, and separately formed investigation teams to engage in investigation work.</p>
<h3>Magic Is Useless: Leader of Heretical Sect Killed</h3>
<p>Wuxi, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the discovery of the Xiantian Dao bandits in Wuxi, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have repeatedly persuaded them earnestly, with all the kindness and sincerity, but they have never realized their mistake, and internal opinions are also divided. Recently, the so-called Jinguang Dharma sect, led by Jiang Xunbo, who claims to be a member of the Xiantian Dao sect in North China, was discovered. Those who join the sect must be cut with a knife eighty-one times, and the knife will not enter the body each time. Xiang soldiers are mobilized, and tens of thousands of people have joined the sect. The masses are all confused. The authorities sent people to persuade them to stop their activities, but Jiang did not know how to restrain himself and volunteered to come to the city for an experiment. On the 18th of this month, Jiang led dozens of disciples to perform rituals in the northern suburbs, reciting spells to the gods. Then, at a distance of 300 meters, Jiang and all his followers were shot dead. Tens of thousands of spectators applauded and praised the deep belief that heretical religions cannot be trusted.</p>
<h3>France Implements Pressure Tactics; Serious Situation in the Near East; Arab League Interferes in Lebanese-French Disputes</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch: The Arab League has formally taken its first intervention measures regarding disputes between Near Eastern countries and France. The League's Chief of General Staff, Asem Bey, issued a statement supporting Syria and Lebanon, stating that world Muslim public opinion supports the current actions of Syria and Lebanon. The Arab League will convene an Arab conference after the conclusion of the San Francisco meeting if necessary. He further stated that Arab nations, unanimously supported by the Muslim world, will forever stand on the side of "freedom and democracy."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - A report from a British correspondent in Cairo states that while the Arab League is actively holding meetings to discuss resolving the Near East issue, the situation between France and Near Eastern countries is becoming increasingly tense. According to a traveling group returning to Cairo yesterday, there were demonstrations in Damascus and Beirut supporting the strong stance taken by the Syrian and Lebanese governments. In particular, in the eastern parts of these areas, there were demonstrations by women. A small bloody riot occurred in Damascus, with seventeen people injured. It is widely believed that the rapid escalation of this situation is due to France suddenly increasing its military presence in the area during talks with Near Eastern governments. The Lebanese government has lodged a protest with the four major powers, arguing that France should not have landed reinforcements in the area without the consent of the Lebanese government. However, France has justified its intrusion into the area on the grounds of strategic, economic (based on agreements granting France economic priority), and cultural development.</p>
<h3>Syria and Lebanon Firmly Reject French Demands</h3>
<p>The French public feels that the British government should support the French government's demands, as Britain itself enjoys special status in Egypt, Iraq, and other places. However, the British authorities are about to approve the declaration of freedom and independence for Near Eastern countries proposed by Catroux, intending to support the proposals made by Lebanon and other countries. Currently, Lebanon and Syria have reached a consensus on their response to French demands. The response states: 1. They will never hold talks with France while France uses military force. 2. The proposals made by France seek to destroy their freedom and independence. 3. They will never grant France greater preferential treatment than Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>Remnants of the European War Affect the Near East</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Amidst the increasingly intense disputes between Tito's government in Yugoslavia and Britain and the United States over the Trieste issue, the remnants of the European war have also affected the Near East, causing friction between Arabs in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq and France. Although Syria and Lebanon declared their independence as republics on September 16, 1941, breaking free from French control, French troops remained stationed in the country. Now, France, under the pretext of troop rotation, has sent new soldiers to Lebanon, exceeding the original number of troops, and has also sent a large number of French officers and generals to infiltrate the area and engage in secret activities, causing dissatisfaction in Lebanon and leading to a stance of resistance against France, although the resistance is passive.</p>
<h3>Iraq Protests Against France</h3>
<p>Iraq formally protested against France on the 20th, criticizing the landing of French troops in Lebanon, and also proposed two measures to Near Eastern countries: 1. To resist such forceful actions by France, Arab countries must form a common front. 2. To crush France's policy of the strong preying on the weak and to establish international justice, this issue must be submitted to the San Francisco Conference for fair handling, calling on the Arab nations to unite and resist France. The future of this issue is highly significant.</p>
<h3>Bloody Conflicts Occur in Syria</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to an official statement released last night in Damascus, bloody conflicts occurred in Syria, resulting in eight deaths (including four students) and twenty-five injuries. However, French news sources claim that "three French citizens were killed."</p>
<h3>San Francisco Passes Amendment</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a San Francisco dispatch: An amendment to the "Regional Alliance" agreement in the world security organization was passed yesterday at the world security conference held by the five major powers. The amendment states: "If another country uses force to invade any member of the alliance, this charter will absolutely protect the right of self-defense of the individual or group, unless the Security Council presents good countermeasures to maintain international security. However, any measures taken under this 'right of self-defense' should be immediately reported to the Security Council and should not hinder the Security Council's power and responsibility to use all means to maintain international security at any time."</p>
<h3>Three-Power Conference May Not Materialize</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters, Prime Minister Churchill and President Truman are eager to hold talks with Chairman Stalin to discuss issues such as Poland and Yugoslavia, but Stalin has not responded to their invitation.</p>
<h3>British General Election Expected in Early July</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to London news, Prime Minister Churchill exchanged letters with leaders of various parties over the weekend, so it is generally believed that the "July general election" may be held between July 5th and 11th. Prime Minister Churchill has strongly argued that the British government will continue to exist as long as the Pacific War has not ended, and all parties should consider how to extend the life of the current parliament.</p>
<h3>Tito Proposes South Slavic-Italian Talks</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a Belgrade radio broadcast: General Tito, in order to resolve the issues of Trieste and Istria, proposed that South Slavic countries and Italy hold direct talks before the peace conference.</p>
<h3>Air Traffic Between Moscow and Berlin Resumes</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Moscow news: The air route between Moscow and Berlin resumed on the 20th, which was the first day of departure from Moscow.</p>
<h3>Welcoming the 40th Navy Day Anniversary</h3>
<p>— by Colonel Matsushima, Head of the Navy Press Department, China</p>
<p>First, Introduction</p>
<p>We now welcome the 40th Navy Day anniversary during the most intense stage of the decisive battle. The military achievements of the Japanese Navy over the past forty years, as well as its valiant battles in this sacred war, relying on its prestige and repeatedly achieving merits, are truly deserving of our boundless respect for all our predecessors and the heroic spirits of past battles. This is one of the things for which we are currently most deeply grateful. The Greater East Asia War has entered a truly profound decisive battle stage. The strategic situation centered on Okinawa Island is a major key to the future course of the war. At the same time, the situation in Europe is rapidly affecting the Pacific war situation. At this moment, we can only strengthen the special attack spirit of our 100 million compatriots and rapidly advance the perfect state of destroying the arrogant enemy. The details are categorized and explained below:</p>
<p>Second, The Current Stage of the Decisive Battle in the Pacific</p>
<p>Since the enemy captured Iwo Jima in mid-March of this year, they have aimed to attack Okinawa Island, an important stronghold for attacking the Japanese mainland. They first used mobile units to attack Kyushu, Shikoku, and the Seto Inland Sea, intending to cut off Japanese aircraft from their source and block communication between the Japanese mainland and Okinawa, seeking a swift decision on Okinawa. From the perspective of the Pacific war's progress, or based on the repeated declarations of the enemy's leaders, this could have been foreseen. The enemy is following its planned efforts to acquire bases to encircle the Japanese mainland. As the enemy unexpectedly suffered fierce blows and extremely heavy personnel losses during the attack on Iwo Jima, they were unusually cautious and seemingly well-prepared when attacking Okinawa Island. Under the command of Commander-in-Chief Nimitz, they mobilized the entire Pacific Fleet and even allowed the British fleet, which had previously been incompatible, to join the same operation, forming a joint British-American force, gathering 1,400 ships and six divisions of land forces, attempting to capture Okinawa Island in one fell swoop. The enemy's operational actions began with the enemy's mobile unit attacking southern Kyushu on March 18th and 19th, but the enemy suffered significant damage in that area and temporarily retreated its mobile unit to the southeast, soon receiving new advanced units from the rear to replenish the losses of the front-line mobile unit. From March 23rd onwards, they launched fierce air raids on Okinawa Island. On the 27th, they landed on the Kerama Islands west of the island, attempting to use them as an important base for capturing Okinawa Island. Afterwards, they launched fierce shelling and bombing of Okinawa Island, and finally, on April 1st, landed near Kita-Nakagusuku in the western part of the island with approximately three divisions of troops, and the war situation became tense.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation of our defense formation, on one hand, we concentrated elite army and navy units on the Okinawa side, constructed extremely complete fortifications based on past operational experience, to block the enemy's attacks from land, sea, and air. At the same time, we dispatched strong air force and naval units from the Japanese mainland and other bases, setting up a posture to annihilate the enemy's amphibious forces coming to Okinawa. The US military initially thought that the operation would be easy, but then gradually increased its forces. By early April, it had mobilized three army divisions and two marine divisions, approximately 100,000 troops, and occupied the Okinawa northern and central airfields. It then advanced to the south, intending to seize the key Japanese strongholds and air bases centered on Shuri and Naha, pressing the so-called southern front. A portion of the troops landed near Nago Town in northwestern Okinawa on April 7th, and then landed on Ie Island, a stronghold to its west. They also consolidated the Nakagusuku Bay anchorage, which became a base for their fleet. As a result, the decisive battle between the Japanese and American forces gradually intensified.</p>
<p>At that time, the Japanese army and navy units relied on the solid terrain for defense when the enemy landed, and then, when the opportunity came, launched the first phase of the general offensive from land, sea, and air on April 6th, followed by the second attack on the 12th and the third attack on the 16th. Although the weather was bad during these days, the Japanese army still launched special attacks on the enemy's troop concentrations, inflicting heavy damage on them. By April 18th, they had established a record of sinking or destroying 393 enemy ships. By May 2nd, this number had increased to over 520 enemy ships sunk or destroyed. The purpose of these attacks by the Japanese army was, of course, to destroy the main force of the enemy's mobile units, and secondly, to concentrate attacks on the enemy's battleships, cruisers, etc., which directly supported the landing operations, the enemy's transport convoys, and the enemy's air power at the land bases. The aforementioned war results of the Japanese army were mostly enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, etc., almost all belonging to the core of the enemy's combat units, so the enemy suffered unexpectedly heavy blows. On April 20th, the enemy's main mobile unit, due to excessive damage, retreated to the rear. Only a specially formed aircraft carrier unit was left to handle communication between the two sides. Around the 30th, a mobile unit composed of two enemy fleets, based on about three formal aircraft carriers and two specially formed aircraft carriers, approached the eastern side of Okinawa. However, it was heavily attacked by the Japanese army and disappeared around May 7th, causing a major setback in the enemy's mobile unit's operational support capability. However, at this time, the enemy repeatedly gathered B29-type aircraft from the Mariana Islands and P51-type aircraft from Iwo Jima to destroy the Japanese bases in Kyushu and cut off communication between the Japanese mainland and Okinawa Island, repeatedly carrying out several long-range enemy air raids. On the land front, the enemy forces, consisting of the Army's 10th Corps (four divisions) and the Navy's 1st and 6th Divisions (approximately 100,000 troops), began a fierce offensive around April 16th, intending to reach the southern front, heading straight for Naha on the west coast, Shuri in the center, and Yonabaru on the east coast, continuing the fierce offensive under the support of large tank forces, air force, and naval artillery fire. The enemy has repeatedly stated that the Okinawa front is an unprecedented fierce battle in the Pacific operation, repeatedly praising the skillful preparation of the Japanese army's positions, the formidable power of the Japanese army defending as if it were a fortress, and the great effect of the Japanese army's heavy artillery. The enemy units on the front line were also exhausted by the fierce fighting. Finally, in late April, the enemy's Army's 96th Division of the central unit seemed to have suffered heavy losses and had to dispatch the Navy's 1st Division and the Army's 77th Division, which were operating in the north, to participate in the battlefield in that area, which shows the enemy's hard struggle.</p>
<p>In addition, the enemy's senior officers, who initially tried to remain silent about the special attack spirit of the Japanese air force, were unable to continue to hide it. Finally, the enemy General Nimitz also frankly admitted that no warship could completely defend against the Japanese kamikaze attacks, so once hit, damage was inevitable. The US military has self-reported that its losses up to April 27th totaled 11,470 dead, wounded, and missing. This number, although understated, gives a glimpse of the situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the actions of the British mobile unit fighting alongside the US military, it was announced that the main battleship, HMS King George V, was damaged when the British mobile unit attacked the Sakishima Islands around April 6th, but no further details were released, which suggests that the actions of the British fleet, which had about two battleships and four aircraft carriers, were very lackluster. Therefore, the strategic situation between the Japanese and American forces centered on Okinawa Island in early May was absolutely favorable to the Japanese side. The enemy's landing troops were constantly attacked by the Japanese army, and the enemy's naval forces were repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army, and were gradually destroyed or forced to retreat. The number of enemy ships around Okinawa also decreased sharply, and by around May 7th, it had about five battleships, ten cruisers, thirty destroyers, and sixty transport ships.</p>
<p>Under this kind of situation, the war situation progressed, and the Japanese army had clearly grasped the divine opportunity for victory. The strength or weakness of the front line depended on the supply situation from the rear. The enemy painfully felt the extreme danger of crossing the broad 4,000-mile Pacific Ocean and the expansion of the distance. The Japanese side took advantage of this opportunity to reverse the war situation in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Third, Overview of Operations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans</p>
<p>The enemy forces in the North Pacific have been inactive for a long time, but as the climate in that area warms up, it is expected that the enemy will attempt to invade Japan's Kuril Islands. As expected, on February 19th, the enemy dispatched some aircraft and ships to attack Shimushu Island and Paramushir Island, but were repelled by the Japanese garrison. The war situation has not developed since then. From the enemy's advertised encirclement of the Japanese mainland, the United States is paying close attention to that area. However, because the focus of the current Pacific operations is concentrated on Okinawa Island, it cannot launch a large-scale attack on that area, and this is only a partial feint.</p>
<p>Next, in the Philippines, the enemy forces have gradually occupied Japanese strongholds, and are currently engaging in land battles in the Baguio and Cagayan Valley areas of Luzon. In Mindanao in the south, the fighting is extremely fierce around Davao. In late April, the enemy mobilized a joint US-British-Australian-Dutch force to attack Tarakan Island on the east coast of Borneo, and fierce fighting is currently underway in that area. In addition, the enemy is conducting sweeping operations along the entire line from the northern coast of New Guinea, New Britain Island, and Bougainville Island in the Japanese South Seas, and local battles are taking place in various places. The Japanese army is bravely fighting in the hot and malarial regions, firmly defending the isolated and unsupported locations, and inflicting heavy blows on the enemy in various regions. In other places, such as Saipan, Tinian, Guam, and Iwo Jima, the remaining Japanese troops are still engaging in guerrilla warfare, causing the enemy to be alarmed and frightened, and venting the immense spirit of the Greater East Asian nations. We express our heartfelt gratitude to these soldiers who are united in spirit and action.</p>
<p>Fourth, The War Situation in the Indian Ocean</p>
<p>The British-Indian and Chinese forces on the Burmese front, with approximately twenty divisions, are gradually approaching the Japanese army's strong positions from the northern mountainous areas. After the Japanese army retreated from Mandalay, the war situation resumed. Fierce fighting continued in the Monywa area from mid-April. In addition, the British-Indian 14th Army is moving south along the Burmese railway line, using the Irrawaddy River for water transport, in coordination with the 15th Army advancing near the coast, attempting to overcome the area near Rangoon, and it seems that they are in fierce fighting in the Rangoon area. At this time, the Indian Ocean Fleet suddenly appeared and shelled the northern and western coasts of Borneo on April 27th. A portion of the forces attacked the Nicobar Islands, all as feints to the operation to attack Rangoon. The enemy's offensive in that area will become increasingly active, and if they have the opportunity, or if they can take advantage, they may launch operations towards the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, mobilizing sea, land, and air forces.</p>
<p>Fifth, The End of the European War and the Pacific War</p>
<p>The European war took an unfavorable turn for the German army this spring. The Soviet army on the eastern front and the joint British-American-Canadian-French forces on the western front advanced extremely rapidly. Finally, on May 2nd, the Soviet army captured Berlin in one fell swoop. The German army suffered heavy casualties. German leader Hitler and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, along with General Keitel, died in battle. The European front was in great chaos. At this time, Germany's new President Dönitz inherited the legacy of Führer Hitler and rose up to save the country. Approximately 200,000 German troops defended the southwest border area of Czechoslovakia, continuing the final resistance. However, the German troops on all fronts were exhausted due to difficulties in supply and long-term hard fighting, and surrendered to the enemy. As a result, the European war quickly came to an end. According to a statement released by General Eisenhower's headquarters on May 7th, representatives of the German side signed an unconditional surrender on that day.</p>
<p>Most of Italy had fallen into the hands of British and American forces. Prime Minister Mussolini, who fought to the end, was also arrested near Milan on April 28th along with his staff and executed by the insurgents. The German troops in northern Italy and southern Austria also surrendered to the enemy, and the war situation was completely under the control of the anti-Axis forces. However, we see that the complex relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the strategic situation in Europe, make it impossible for the US military to quickly deploy to the Pacific. Although the enemy, the US military, will quickly replenish its forces in the Pacific in order to end the Pacific war in one fell swoop, we have a great determination and need to be extremely vigilant against the US military coming to the Pacific and the Chinese army and the British and American forces attempting to launch a counter-offensive on the Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>Sixth, Conclusion</p>
<p>In short, the world war situation has taken a sharp turn. Japan has lost its two allied countries, Germany and Italy, and is facing the strength of the United States and Britain in the Pacific to determine the outcome. The fate of victory or defeat has become hundreds of times more important. At this critical moment, Japan resolutely bears the sacred teachings, to annihilate the arrogant enemy, the United States and Britain. Under the banner of a total attack by 100 million people, we are showing the world our blood and justice. Although the enemy army is powerful, the Japanese army still holds important strategies and favorable situations, and the fierce fighting spirit of 100 million special attack forces. We shoulder the imperishable group of the Empire, holding the great spirit of eternal glory, and at the same time, the authorities take appropriate measures externally, which will inevitably lead to a war situation that is favorable to Japan, which we firmly believe.</p>
<p>Now, under this intense decisive battle, we welcome the 40th Japanese Navy Day anniversary. Recalling the spirit of our predecessors who fought bravely at that time, we firmly believe that the tireless efforts of the Japanese Navy over the past forty years are realized today. We must work even harder to build a permanently indestructible pyramid for the East Asian nations that will be deeply engraved in history. The spirits of the imperial ancestors and the heroic spirits of tens of thousands of war dead are soaring in the sky. We will resolutely move forward, with ghosts and gods clearing the way, and our army, even if it is tens of thousands strong, will resolutely advance bravely.</p>
<h3>Negotiations with the Jiangsu Provincial Authorities: The Implementation of Agricultural Loans; A Record of the Visit to Jiangsu by Consulting Committee Member Chen Binhe</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Consulting Committee proposed the establishment of agricultural loans in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province. The Agricultural Loan Syndicate was established on the 20th of this month. However, certain implementation issues need to be discussed with the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Therefore, the Consulting Committee dispatched Committee Member Chen Binhe to Suzhou to consult with Provincial Governor Ren. He departed for Suzhou by the early train yesterday and returned to Shanghai in the afternoon. A reporter from the Central News Agency immediately visited Mr. Chen to inquire about the progress of the negotiations, and he reported as follows:</p>
<p>Since Provincial Governor Ren took office last November, he has implemented many reforms in provincial administration. Although originally from Suzhou, I have not returned to my hometown for over a decade and have long desired to visit Suzhou. This time, due to the agricultural loan matter, it was necessary to negotiate with the provincial authorities. Upon the order of Chairman Li Sihao of the Consulting Committee, I made a special trip to Suzhou to meet with Provincial Governor Ren. The results of the talks can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai and Jiangsu Province Share a Close Relationship</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial authorities have always prioritized stabilizing people's livelihoods and increasing agricultural production as key policy focuses. The provincial government's implementation of in-kind tax collection last year and Shanghai's initiative to launch agricultural loan programs align with the province's policy priorities, for which the province expressed its extreme welcome. Shanghai and Jiangsu share a close relationship in regional economics. The success of this agricultural loan will further promote a close relationship. Therefore, the provincial authorities expressed admiration and gratitude for the concern and cooperation of Mayor Zhou, Secretary-General Luo, and leaders from industry and commerce, especially the financial sector.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Forms a Committee to Prepare Implementation Plan</p>
<p>After the provincial government accepted the agricultural loan proposal, it treated the practical handling of the matter with great seriousness. After receiving the news of Shanghai's agricultural loan initiative, it dispatched Finance Director Pei, Construction Director Sun, and Liaison Director Jin on May 16 to Shanghai for multiple discussions with various parties. Currently, the provincial government has organized an Agricultural Loan Committee to handle the matter, with Provincial Governor Ren serving as the chairman. They are preparing all implementation plans, with Liaison Director Jin Dazuo and experts from his department providing enthusiastic assistance.</p>
<p>The Farming Season is Imminent; Hoping to Raise Funds Quickly</p>
<p>The farming season is fast approaching, and Jiangsu Province hopes to raise the full amount of 5 billion yuan for agricultural loans by early June, in order to implement the lending plan. Delaying the fundraising efforts would be a case of twice the effort for half the result. The agricultural loans are primarily intended to directly benefit farmers, preventing manipulation and exploitation by intermediaries.</p>
<p>Selecting Funds, Purchasing Rice, and Transporting to Shanghai; The Provincial Government Will Fully Facilitate</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial authorities are extremely concerned about the food supply in Shanghai. When Mayor Zhou first took office, they expressed their willingness to cooperate. With this agricultural loan program, the repayment of principal and interest will be used by the grain control agencies to purchase rice and transport it to Shanghai, addressing the food needs of the people. The provincial government will certainly provide assistance and facilitate this effort to the fullest extent. (When discussing the issue of assisting Shanghai's food supply, Provincial Governor Ren expressed an extremely responsible and affirmative attitude.)</p>
<p>Provincial Governor Ren will personally visit Shanghai in the near future to express his gratitude for the cooperation of the municipal authorities and all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when I went to Suzhou, I carried a formal letter from Chairman Li of the Consulting Committee to Provincial Governor Ren of Jiangsu Province, which is transcribed below along with the reply from the Jiangsu Provincial authorities:</p>
<p>Letter from the Consulting Committee to the Jiangsu Provincial Government</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>We, the members of this committee, are aware that the Shanghai's food problem is closely related to the increased grain production in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province. The resolution of Shanghai's food problem depends on the increased grain production in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, and the anticipation of increased grain production must begin with relieving the economic suffering of farmers. Based on this understanding, we have proposed the implementation of rural loans in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province, which was approved at the 14th committee meeting on April 16, and a subcommittee was established to promote it. After three discussions, it was decided to organize an Agricultural Loan Syndicate Committee, with nine committee members elected. Sihao was nominated as the chairman, responsible for raising the total amount of 5 million yuan in agricultural loans. Given that the farming season is approaching and farmers are in dire need of funds, we are making every effort to implement the loan program in the shortest possible time. In order to achieve close cooperation with your provincial government for the implementation of the loan program, we have entrusted your provincial government with full authority to handle it. However, to effectively benefit the people of Shanghai, when the new grain is harvested, we ask you to assist with how to use the principal and interest from the agricultural loan repayments to purchase grain and transport it to Shanghai, thus regulating the food supply. We respectfully submit this letter and hope for your review and reply.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Li Sihao, Chairman of the Current Affairs Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Consulting Committee. (May 21)</p>
<p>Reply from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to the Consulting Committee</p>
<p>Respectfully replying: We have received and carefully reviewed your letter. We are deeply grateful for Shanghai's agricultural loan initiative, which will assist in increasing agricultural production in Jiangsu Province. Regarding the request that the Jiangsu Provincial Government assist with using the principal and interest from the agricultural loans to purchase rice for Shanghai through the grain control agencies to regulate the food supply, the Jiangsu Provincial Government will certainly facilitate this matter to the fullest extent to fulfill the noble intentions of your Consulting Committee in planning for the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ren Yuandao, Provincial Governor of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. (May 22)</p>
<p>At this point, the discussion of the agricultural loan issue came to an end. Mr. Chen added that he also discussed Jiangsu's construction issues with Provincial Governor Ren and was very willing to relay them to the reporter, but due to the lateness of the hour, he promised to arrange a follow-up conversation tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Oath-Taking Ceremony for Baojia Personnel in the Three Districts of Southern Shanghai; Committee Chairman Luo Attends and Addresses the Gathering</h3>
<p>The Baojia personnel from the three districts of Southern Shanghai – Yimiao, Penglai, and Xieqiao – held a joint supplementary oath-taking ceremony at Penglai Square at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd). At the same time, the first graduation ceremony of the Baojia Cadre Training Class was held. Secretary-General Luo of the municipal government attended and addressed the gathering in his capacity as Chairman of the Municipal Baojia Committee. Director Gu of the Baojia Office, who also serves as Director of the Southern District Office, personally presided over the ceremony, which was simple yet grand. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Oath-Taking Ceremony</p>
<p>Those present included Committee Chairman Luo, Director Gu of the Baojia Office, Director Da of the Chuanma Office, directors of various district offices, representatives from various departments of the Municipal Police Bureau, Chief Noguchi of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters, chiefs of various sections of the headquarters, police chiefs of the Yimiao, Penglai, and Xieqiao districts, the captain of the Japanese Military Police in Southern Shanghai, and over five hundred people, including the chairmen and chief liaison chiefs of the eighteen Baojia districts in the city. The ceremony began with a review of the cadre training class and the model white-shirt corps members from the three Baojia districts, presided over by Committee Chairman Luo and accompanied by Director Gu. This was followed by a march-past. After the march-past, a joint supplementary substantive oath-taking ceremony and the cadre training graduation ceremony were held. After everyone performed a ritual of obeisance, Deputy Director Xiao Gang of the Southern District Office of the Baojia Office gave a report, and then the oath-taking ceremony was held, supervised by Director Gu, who also issued certificates and awards. Committee Chairman Luo and Director Gu of the Baojia Office then gave successive addresses, offering much encouragement. Guests were then invited to speak. The captain of the Military Police in Southern Shanghai briefly stated: "In the past, the Baojia in Southern Shanghai provided much assistance in maintaining local order. In the future, they must continue to work hard, especially to cooperate fully in the current situation of the Greater East Asia War." Chairman Chen Fukang of the Taishan District, representing the Baojia districts of the city, briefly stated: "I hope to work hard and live up to the Baojia's mission." Telegrams of respect from Acting Chairman Chen of Shanghai, the director of the Police Bureau, and Secretary-General Luo, who also serves as committee chairman, were then read aloud. Finally, a representative of the chief liaison chiefs of the three Baojia districts gave a speech of thanks, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Chairman Luo's Address</p>
<p>Chairman Luo said in his address: "I am attending today's graduation ceremony of the cadre training class and the joint inauguration of Baojia personnel from Yimiao, Penglai, and Xieqiao districts in my capacity as Chairman of the Municipal Baojia Committee. At the same time, I am holding an inspection. I am very pleased to be able to speak with all the comrades participating in the actual work. Southern Shanghai is an important area of Shanghai. Before the [war] incident, it was quite prosperous in terms of culture and commerce. The Baojia system has been implemented in various parts of Shanghai for many years. Not only have past achievements been good, but local security has also been relatively stable, and local construction has gradually improved. I am deeply gratified. I also worked in Southern Shanghai for five years, presiding over the Central Tax Police Regiment and the Tax Police School, so I am quite familiar with the situation in Southern Shanghai. Now, the Baojia in Southern Shanghai, through the efforts of Director Gu and all of you comrades, has been formally established as a legitimate institution, and personnel have also been adjusted. I firmly believe that there will be unlimited development and solid consolidation in the future. All of you have professions, fulfill your local obligations, work with enthusiasm, do not forget the responsibilities of the people themselves, and lay the foundation for self-governance and defense. And use this foundation to exert strength, to assume major missions, to serve the country and the nation. At the same time, the Baojia is a bridge between the state and the people, to convey the situation upwards and downwards. The opinions of the people should be put forward to the government. Those of you who are engaged in real practical work should also be models for the people, abide by the law, become model good citizens, and work hard in society to shoulder the important task of national revival. My ambition in working in Shanghai has always been to modernize China and make Shanghai Chinese, to create a modern China, to make Shanghai a purely Chinese city, and to eliminate all malformed phenomena. All of you have a long history in Southern Shanghai and should work together to restore and revive it. At the same time, you are all very clear about the current situation. In this tense situation, we should work harder, not give up our responsibilities, and jointly assume responsibility. Finally, I wish you all a boundless future."</p>
<p>Director Gu's Address</p>
<p>The Director of the Baojia Office stated in his address: "The Baojia has made considerable progress, especially since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo arrived in Shanghai. Looking back, all aspects of Shanghai have indeed progressed a great deal. Thanks to everyone's efforts and hard work, the Baojia has achieved today's results. Since Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo took office, they have put in the greatest effort to administer Shanghai and maintain local order. Therefore, we must first clearly identify our loyalty to and protection of Mayor Zhou and Secretary-General Luo, and actively serve the public interest of the local area with a selfless spirit. Today, in my capacity as the concurrent director of the Southern District, I am speaking to you. Since you have an organization and training, support the government's policies, and work together under the leadership of Mayor Zhou, work hard in your respective positions, and constantly examine and correct your shortcomings, strive to make the people happy, trust us, and seek progress."</p>
<h3>Household Flour Rationing Will Be Distributed This Month</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Association Shanghai District Rationing Office, in order to supplement the lack of food for the people, continues to find ways to maintain the household flour rationing program, despite many difficulties. In the past few months, flour was rationed three times a month, and the rationing price was kept low, unwilling to raise it easily. In the past two months, however, the amount of wheat purchased has gradually decreased, and the price of wheat has gradually risen to the same level as rice. The production of flour is low and the cost is heavy. After several consultations, it was decided to maintain the livelihood of the average common people, and the number of rationing times was changed to once a month. The price of flour was increased threefold starting in April. According to reports from the reporter, the April household flour rationing has been completed, and the May household flour rationing is in preparation and is expected to continue to be distributed by the end of this month, with the price remaining the same. The amount per person is still one jin. Rationing for various honored and special people is also in the planning stage.</p>
<h3>County Administration Office Rectifies County Police Discipline; Orders Compliance with Various Regulations and Orders</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal County Administration Office has followed the instructions of its superiors and strived to strengthen the police discipline of the police in the counties under its jurisdiction, as well as the implementation of police administration, in order to establish a model police style. The office has now formulated more than ten measures to rectify the police discipline in each county for the convenience of implementation, based on the matters agreed upon at the police administration symposium on April 20 of this year. These measures have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and filing, and the office has issued orders to its subordinates to strictly and conscientiously comply with them from now on. At the same time, in order to understand whether the people's suffering can actually be reduced after the promulgation of this measure, and whether the police in each county are superficially compliant and secretly defiant, the office has decided to secretly dispatch cadres to each county to conduct investigations at any time, in order to achieve the goal of eliminating abuses and purifying the atmosphere. The measures to rectify the police discipline in each county are summarized below:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality County Administration Office (hereinafter referred to as this office) has formulated these measures in order to correct the bad behavior of the police in the counties under its jurisdiction, and to severely crack down on acts that disturb and harm the people, so as to grasp the hearts of the people and establish a model police discipline under the wartime system.</p>
<p>County police officers should be loyal to their duties and must not be perfunctory, compromise with the environment.</p>
<p>County police officers should be committed to sacrificing for the sake of the local area, not yielding to intimidation, not being tempted by profit, and especially should love the people and relieve their suffering at any time.</p>
<p>The heads of the police bureaus in each county should self-examine and self-discipline, be role models for their subordinates, and strengthen the lower-level cadres at any time to share the responsibility of rectification.</p>
<p>The heads of the police bureaus in each county should pay attention to the etiquette, clothing, and spirit of the police officers under their jurisdiction at any time, and should especially review and reform whether the handling of incidents is prompt and legal. The following situations should be severely cracked down on and absolutely not allowed to exist.</p>
<p>Forming cliques for private gain and seizing everything.</p>
<p>Colluding with bandits to harm the local area.</p>
<p>Fattening on the people and oppressing the good people.</p>
<p>Extorting supplies from the local area.</p>
<p>Extorting the people under the guise of official duties.</p>
<p>Protecting gambling or smuggling.</p>
<p>Accepting bribes to release cases.</p>
<p>Using a dragnet to collect money.</p>
<p>When serving at stations and pillboxes, insulting, scolding, or beating passengers, or colluding with station and wharf workers to manipulate chestnut prices, causing passengers to suffer.</p>
<p>Obstructing the legal circulation of supplies.</p>
<p>Other illegal acts of dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>Any county police officer who violates the provisions of the preceding article shall be dismissed or detained by the competent officer, and if criminal offences are involved, the matter shall be reported to the superior authorities and transferred to the judicial organs or the Shanghai branch of the Special Court for strict handling in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>If the head of the police bureau or the competent person in each county knows about the illegal acts of dereliction of duty of the police officers but does not report them, or hopes to shield them, once discovered and verified, the competent person shall be punished as an accomplice, and those who fail to supervise strictly shall also be held jointly responsible.</p>
<p>The police bureaus in each county shall personally or send personnel to investigate the work of the police officers under their jurisdiction, and shall urge them to achieve the goal of eliminating abuses and purifying the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In addition to accepting fair advice from the public, the police bureaus in each county shall reform police affairs at any time, and shall set up suggestion boxes in appropriate locations to accept the opinions of the people, the implementation of which shall be formulated by each police bureau and reported to this office for approval.</p>
<p>The county police bureaus shall formulate concise slogans and post them in the main roads and stations and wharves, advising people not to give money or property to police officers, and those who do so shall be punished as bribers.</p>
<p>This office may send personnel to inspect the police bureaus in each county when necessary in order to understand the situation of the police in each county and to step up supervision.</p>
<h3>Establishing the Eternal Monument of the Fazang Lecture Temple</h3>
<p>Since the winter of the thirty-first year [of the Republic, 1942], Fazang Temple has spared no effort in rebuilding the Pure Land Taoist site and rectifying the doctrinal style. Now, in order to publicly announce that this temple will forever be a forest of the ten directions, Master Xingci has personally formulated nine articles of the Eternal Rules and Regulations, and has personally drawn and engraved them on stone, so as to preserve them forever. On May 26, the Eternal Monument will be erected in the Great Hall of this temple. From now on, all those who preside over this temple should follow the outline of the rules and regulations in their approach to propagating the Dharma and in their legislative actions.</p>
<h3>The Inscription on the Eternal Monument of the Fazang Lecture Temple</h3>
<p>Fazang Lecture Temple was founded by me, in order to uphold the wish of the Buddha to guide all sentient beings, specializing in the Pure Land Dharma Door as the correct practice. I also lament the decline of the Dharma path, and think of propagating the teachings of the Tiantai school, so that all may open the Buddha's knowledge and vision as an auxiliary practice, hence the name. The temple was built in the spring of the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924], and the east house and west building were completed in the autumn. After several years, the Maitreya Grand Hall was completed in succession, and after several renovations, it has its current appearance. Since I founded this Taoist site, leading the people in reciting the Buddha's name and lecturing on the teachings, for twenty years, I am deeply grateful for the pressure of circumstances, and the Dharma affinity is growing day by day. Only remembering that I am old, the task of revitalizing the industry and maintaining success awaits those who come after me. In this late age, temples lack regulations, so I have to plan for the future in order to maintain it for a long time. Therefore, I have listed the main points, handwritten them and engraved them on stone, so that those who preside over this temple in the future will have something to follow in their actions and legislation. May all my disciples follow this guidance, and may all virtuous people of the ten directions witness this sincerity.</p>
<p>1. This temple will forever be a forest of the ten directions.</p>
<p>2. This temple takes the practice of the Pure Land Dharma Door and the promotion of the Tiantai teachings as its doctrinal style. Those who live together must truly practice and study hard, and expect to achieve this.</p>
<p>3. The abbot of this temple is chosen from the ten directions. The abbot is elected by the leaders and those with virtue, prestige, and talent inside and outside the temple to preside over the temple affairs. The term of office is five years, and they may be re-elected consecutively.</p>
<p>4. The heads of the classes and the stewards of this temple are appointed by the abbot. All appointments are based on merit and talent. Those who are heads of classes must have cultivation and practice, and understand the teachings. Those who are stewards must be proficient in current affairs and be impartial and selfless.</p>
<p>5. No one may arbitrarily sell or change the temple property. If it is necessary for the benefit of the temple, the abbot may convene the stewards to discuss and decide.</p>
<p>6. The temple's finances are open. The usual expenses are divided into Dharma propagation and administration. All expenses must be based on the budget, and frugality is the main principle.</p>
<p>7. The temple's documents must be carefully preserved. The inner Buddhist scriptures and are especially cherished and provided for circulation and study.</p>
<p>8. As this temple is a Pure Land site, benefactors who come to the temple to cultivate blessings must not engage in wine, gambling, or other practices that defile the Pure Land.</p>
<p>9. If the abbot or any member of the congregation is unworthy and violates these key points, they may be impeached and moved out. Winter month of the thirty-third year of the Republic of China [1944]. Tiantai Mountain Shilong Bhikkhu Xingci Dan. Xiao Tuo of Mount Yue inscribed the plaque.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Continue to Investigate Goods Exceeding Price Limits; Those Found Guilty Will Be Severely Punished According to Law</h3>
<p>Recently, prices in this city have risen again due to the instigation of unscrupulous merchants, threatening the people's livelihood. It is understood that the economic police authorities, in order to completely suppress prices, previously joined with the military police to form an investigation team, which was dispatched to commercial markets, companies, and firms in all districts of the city to conduct strict investigations. Those who are found to be exceeding price limits and engaging in black market trading will be punished. More than 3,000 illegal shops have been punished, and active and thorough investigations are still underway. All eleven major commodities must be sold in accordance with the price limits reviewed and approved by the Commodities Evaluation Committee. Other commodities must also be sold in strict accordance with the prices agreed upon by the respective industry associations and approved by the authorities. If anyone is found to be exceeding the price limits or engaging in black market trading, they will be severely punished according to law. Citizens are encouraged to report such cases in order to curb the evil trend of raising prices at will and to maintain the people's livelihood.</p>

<p>Commercial Banks Adopt Subsidiary Ledgers</p>
<p>According to sources in the banking industry in this city yesterday, major commercial banks have recently adopted a subsidiary ledger system to prevent accidents. All accounts of correspondent clients are retained as copies. In addition to the head office, branch offices in this city also have special subsidiary ledger sections. This measure is a necessary procedure during an emergency period to provide greater security for customer deposits.</p>
<p>Silver and Money Instruments Exchanged Every Other Day</p>
<p>The exchange of instruments between the silver and money industries in this city was originally scheduled to be completed on the same day. However, it has been felt that the large number of instruments, the mixed collection and disbursement of silver, and the crowded market exchange have doubled the difficulties for the industry. In order to alleviate the difficulties between colleagues, the two associations of the two industries and the person in charge of the Money Clearing House are actively planning for the exchange of instruments every other day. According to sources in the financial industry, the implementation of this every-other-day exchange method will greatly benefit the industry, and the difference in the exchange amount can also be reduced as a result. However, whether the customer service side will experience difficulties due to the every-other-day exchange is also being considered in negotiations. It will be implemented as soon as a decision is made.</p>
